WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.836
XANDER:
 This is what happened
 this year.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.807
WILLOW:
Tomorrow night
we're bringing Buffy back.

00:06.839 --> 00:08.742
XANDER:
You're talking about
raising the dead.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.378
I think I was in heaven.

00:10.410 --> 00:13.480
I was torn out of there
by my friends.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.350
I'm headed back to England,
and I plan to stay.

00:16.384 --> 00:20.420
So you three
have, what, banded together
to be pains in my ass?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.422
We're your
arch "nemesises-ses."

00:22.455 --> 00:24.492
Willow, you are using
too much magic.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.725
I don't think
this is gonna work.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.062
WILLOW:
Are you saying
you're gonna leave me?

00:28.096 --> 00:30.431
-BUFFY:
Willow has a problem.
-I need help!

00:30.463 --> 00:32.765
SPIKE:
We kissed, Buffy.
I'm in love with you.

00:32.799 --> 00:35.103
-You're in love with pain.
-You afraid I'm gonna--

00:35.136 --> 00:39.207
-Things have changed.
-The only thing that's different
is I'm disgusted with myself.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.109
It's over.
I'm using you.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.942
-We're getting married.
-Congratulations.

00:42.975 --> 00:45.079
Xander's missing?
What do you mean,
Xander's missing?

00:45.112 --> 00:47.914
I wish we could
just go back to the way
things were before.

00:47.948 --> 00:51.051
And I wish
you were never born.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.124
You left me, Xander,
at the altar.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.725
So you go out and bang
the first body you can find?

00:58.759 --> 01:02.362
-It was good enough for Buffy.
-Shut up and leave her out of--

01:02.396 --> 01:04.298
GILES:
We can't ignore
this kind of behavior.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.766
Something needs to be done
 before it spins out of control.

01:06.799 --> 01:08.269
Can you just be
kissing me now?

01:10.804 --> 01:12.206
-Stop, please!
-I'm gonna make you feel it!

01:12.239 --> 01:14.108
No! Stop!

01:14.141 --> 01:16.810
Ask me again
why I could never love you.

01:16.843 --> 01:19.612
Get nice and comfy, Slayer.
I'll be back.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.448
Think you can just
do that to me?

01:23.917 --> 01:26.319
Tara?

01:26.353 --> 01:27.254
Tara?

01:27.287 --> 01:28.555
Bring her back!

01:28.588 --> 01:31.091
-It is done!
-No!

01:31.125 --> 01:33.760
BUFFY: Something
terrible has happened.
You don't have to do this.

01:33.793 --> 01:35.829
WILLOW:
I need power.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.430
XANDER:
Wil, what are you doing?
She's gonna die.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.133
WILLOW:
No, she isn't.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.533
BUFFY:
We need to find Willow.

01:42.170 --> 01:45.673
And you want to return
to your former self?

01:45.706 --> 01:48.176
Bitch is gonna
see a change.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.745
Let me go. Somebody!
Please! God!

01:51.778 --> 01:52.813
Bored now.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.250
Willow,
what did you do?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.350
One down.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.531
(panting)
I think I'm gonna be sick.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.768
Again?
Xander, we don't
have time.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.604
I know. It's just...
what happened back there--

02:17.638 --> 02:22.109
the sounds of it,
the smell.

02:22.141 --> 02:25.646
-I know.
-Willow did that.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.980
That's why we have
to keep moving.

02:28.014 --> 02:30.283
You heard what she said,
"One down."

02:30.318 --> 02:32.453
She was talking
about two to go, right?

02:32.485 --> 02:35.155
Jonathan and
what's-his-face--
the other guy.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.990
Andrew. They're just sitting
at County Jail without a clue
Willow's coming.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.627
You don't think she's gonna
kill them, too? She wouldn't.
It doesn't make sense.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.062
Willow's got
an addictive personality.
She just tasted blood.

02:43.096 --> 02:46.033
I mean, she could
be there already.
No, she couldn't.

02:46.066 --> 02:49.870
A witch at her level--
she could only go airborne.
It's a thing.

02:49.902 --> 02:53.406
More flashy.
impresses the locals,
but it does take longer.

02:53.441 --> 02:57.311
-Longer than what?
-Teleporting.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.647
Right. Vengeance demon.
Well, at least she'll
get there first.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.417
I'm counting the ways
that can go wrong.

03:03.450 --> 03:07.420
Well, Anya can handle herself.
Against Willow? Tonight?
Don't be too sure.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.056
Well, she should be coming down
at some point, shouldn't she?

03:10.090 --> 03:14.395
I mean, back there,
she was out of her head,
running on grief and magics.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.563
Doesn't matter,
Willow just killed
someone.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.866
Killing people changes you.
Believe me, I know.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.402
Warren was
a cold-blooded killer
of women just warming up.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.372
If you ask me,
the bastard had it
coming to him.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.074
Maybe. Andrew
and Jonathan don't.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.277
This is still Willow
we're dealing with, right?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.445
I hope so.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.682
Whatever
she's going through,
we have to stop her.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.884
Maybe we
can actually do that
if we can get to your...

03:39.118 --> 03:41.087
car.
Willow.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.626
Guess she wants to
finish the job
without us tagging along.

03:45.658 --> 03:48.161
Meet me at the jail.
Sure. How are you gonna--

03:52.500 --> 03:56.036
Okay then.
I'll just catch up.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.038
She's only
my best friend, you know.

03:58.070 --> 04:00.139
No big deal, just...

04:04.812 --> 04:06.347
glad I can help.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.959
Dude, move, like,
a foot to your left.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.129
What for?

05:29.161 --> 05:30.697
I'm trying to
hear something.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.165
Like what?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.369
Signals.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.170
Oh, for crying
out loud. Signals?

05:38.204 --> 05:41.207
Who from,
your probe-happy
alien friends?

05:41.240 --> 05:44.812
Say, maybe we can trade
a pack of cigarettes
in for tinfoil.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.879
Make you a nice
little antenna hat.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.848
Laugh it up, fuzzball.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.518
I figured it out.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.521
Warren never abandoned us.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.523
Well, not me, anyway.

05:55.555 --> 05:59.659
This is, like, his test.
If we can figure out how
he's communicating with us,

05:59.692 --> 06:02.596
then we'll be,
you know, worthy.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.497
You're checking
for implants?

06:04.531 --> 06:07.233
Lex Luthor had
a false epidermis escape kit

06:07.266 --> 06:09.403
in Superman Versus
 the Amazing Spider-Man,
Treasury Edition.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.404
Okay, first of all,
those were sonic disrupters.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.675
Second of all, you are
sadness personified.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.009
Waiting for Warren?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.846
Yeah, maybe he'll
come bust us out of here
on Santa's magic sleigh.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.182
I'm telling him
you said that.

06:22.214 --> 06:24.350
Why wait?
Tell him right now.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.220
Hey, Warren, do you read me?
Your girlfriend's
pathetic. Over.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.889
Shut up, Jerk-athan!

06:28.922 --> 06:33.560
You see this?
This is why we get jet packs
and all you get is left behind.

06:33.593 --> 06:37.798
So you admit it.
Why not? Why not?

06:37.831 --> 06:43.737
You were out of the trio
a long time ago...
in a galaxy far, far away.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.505
And you want to know why,
little feller?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.108
No respect for
the chain of command.

06:49.141 --> 06:52.480
Yeah, see how far
it's gotten you?
Checking every hole

06:52.512 --> 06:55.048
in your sad, little body
for transmitters
that don't exist.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.317
Oh, I'll find it,
if I have to check every hole
in my body and yours.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.523
Get off!
Make me!

07:04.791 --> 07:08.661
-There you two are.
-Y-You do that?

07:08.696 --> 07:12.064
Listen to me. We have to
get you out of here,
or you'll both be killed. Guard!

07:12.098 --> 07:14.266
-What's going on?
-Guard!

07:14.300 --> 07:17.571
Stop that! I-I don't trust her.
Do you trust her?
This is major uncool.

07:17.605 --> 07:21.074
Um, Anya? You're gonna
have to break this down
for us a little.

07:21.108 --> 07:25.846
Warren shot Buffy.
Warren shot Tara.
Buffy's alive.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.980
Tara's dead.
Willow found out,

07:28.014 --> 07:30.117
and being
the most powerful Wicca
in the Western Hemisphere,

07:30.149 --> 07:32.319
decided to get the payback,
with interest.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.189
-What about Warren?
-She killed him.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.925
Ripped him apart,
and bloodied up
the forest doing it.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.360
Now she's coming here,
and the two of you
are next.

07:41.394 --> 07:46.266
-Oh, my God. Warren.
-Oh, my God. Me.

07:46.298 --> 07:47.634
Guard!

07:47.668 --> 07:49.802
We didn't do anything.
Guard!

07:51.838 --> 07:54.206
All right. All right.
What do you--

07:55.875 --> 07:59.379
-Who the hell are you?
-Something's coming.
Something bad.

07:59.411 --> 08:02.850
You have to let these men
out of here, or I guarantee you,
there will be hell to pay.

08:02.882 --> 08:06.819
Okay, uh,
what exactly's coming?

08:06.853 --> 08:09.288
One of the many things
in this world you are
not prepared to deal with.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.391
Huh. That a fact?
Yes, and we're
running out of time.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.028
So just believe me
when I tell you,
these things are real,

08:15.062 --> 08:17.598
they're dangerous,
and they're coming.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.901
(police radio chatter)

08:24.504 --> 08:26.906
(rumbling)

08:39.351 --> 08:41.855
What the hell was that?

08:44.591 --> 08:46.894
Listen, I don't know
what you think
you're doing, but just--

08:46.927 --> 08:48.895
Take a nap.

08:58.706 --> 09:02.542
So please, stop looking at me
like it's your first trip
to the circus and do your job.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.644
Let them out.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.788
-You three stay here.
-Oh, like we have a choice!

09:15.822 --> 09:19.058
Don't move.
You'll be safe here.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.129
Are you even listening?
This is the one place
they won't be safe.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.940
(chattering)

09:32.972 --> 09:34.307
Back off.

09:38.778 --> 09:39.846
Hold it!

09:43.415 --> 09:45.085
Stop it. Just stop.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.254
Why is she doing this?
Tell her we didn't
do anything.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.091
Yes, we did.
We signed on.
We teamed up.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.426
We wanted to see where
our plans would take us.
Well, take a look.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.495
-This is it!
-Maybe for you.

09:56.528 --> 09:58.698
(yelling)

10:00.432 --> 10:03.671
OFFICER:
Get down, lady.
You heard me, down!

10:09.341 --> 10:11.344
MAN:
Get your men out there!

10:11.378 --> 10:15.182
Anya, teleport us
out of here, please.
Take us with you.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.083
I can't.
It doesn't work that way.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.352
Oh, God. Help!

10:20.386 --> 10:23.123
(men yelling)

10:35.668 --> 10:39.338
(overlapping yelling)

10:58.725 --> 11:01.695
Buffy.
Willow, just stop for a second
and listen to--

11:04.264 --> 11:07.768
(screaming)

11:13.505 --> 11:16.375
(screaming)

11:16.408 --> 11:18.211
Aah! What's that sound?

11:18.245 --> 11:21.014
God, it kills.
We're gonna have to
make a run for it.

11:21.048 --> 11:24.918
ANDREW: Are you kidding? She's
like Dark Phoenix up there.
You expect us to outrun her?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.187
Pretty much.
(tires squealing)

11:27.220 --> 11:29.188
Get in.
Go!

11:32.424 --> 11:34.626
BUFFY:
Go! Go!

11:38.264 --> 11:41.168
OFFICER:
Hey! Hey, hey!

11:41.201 --> 11:44.071
Is she coming?
I don't see anything.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.173
Are you guys all right?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.375
-Are you injured?
-I-I don't think so.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.778
Where are you taking us?

11:52.312 --> 11:55.715
We'll find someplace safe,
and we'll keep you there
until we can stop Willow.

11:55.749 --> 11:59.119
Run and hide?
That's your brilliant plan?
I don't believe this.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.421
Boys, if you don't
knock it off, I will
pull this car over,

12:01.453 --> 12:03.456
and you can just walk
to your painful deaths
from here.

12:11.563 --> 12:14.033
I don't get it.
Willow's a witch.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.769
Why doesn't she just,
you know, wave her arms
and make us dead?

12:16.803 --> 12:19.706
Because she doesn't
want you dead.
She wants to kill you.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.942
But we didn't
do anything. Ow!

12:22.975 --> 12:26.113
I hate to admit it, Buff,
but Jonathan
may have a point.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.581
Why isn't she
right here right now?

12:30.082 --> 12:33.385
Maybe she's just getting
her mojo up and running.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.289
Or maybe she hasn't figured out
exactly how much power
she really has yet.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.726
-Neither have we.
-I guess we keep running then.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.429
I still can't believe
that was Willow.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.832
I mean, I've known her
almost as long as you guys.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.668
Willow was, you know,

12:48.701 --> 12:52.905
she packed her own lunches
and wore floods
and was always...

12:52.940 --> 12:54.807
just Willow.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.945
-Geez it!
-What was that?

13:00.179 --> 13:01.480
Just Willow.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.976
Okay, any ideas?
Drive faster.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.558
This is faster.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.563
She knows you're in
this car too, right?

13:52.698 --> 13:54.033
Right?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.907
-She's draining.
-She's what-ing?

14:02.408 --> 14:03.910
Just keep going.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.539
(breathing heavily)

14:34.975 --> 14:36.808
Cool.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.850
CLEM:
Not that I'm knocking
the nacho cheese ones.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.386
I like the taste.
It's just the texture
I can't deal with.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.460
So gritty.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.462
Kind of hurts
my tongue.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.100
So, I give 'em a seven,
maybe a seven-five.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.436
And you think this
is dumb, don't you?

15:03.470 --> 15:06.239
Uh, no, no.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.375
As taste tests go,
this is definitely one of
the better ones I've been to.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.078
I get it.
No biggie.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.880
-Uh, do you wanna play cards?
-Clem--

15:14.913 --> 15:17.750
I can be a real boredom buster
if you just give me
half a chance.

15:17.783 --> 15:21.488
It's not you.
Still, I feel
responsible.

15:21.520 --> 15:26.192
It's not fair,
a girl your age
cooped up in a crypt.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.629
Tell you what. Let me
get my hat and my coat.
I'll take you to a movie.

15:30.663 --> 15:34.767
-We'll go nuts! PG-13.
-Clem.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.836
-Uh-huh?
-Look at me.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.272
Do I look weak to you
or incapable?

15:39.306 --> 15:42.942
Heck no.
So why
am I stuck here?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.113
No good reason
I can see.

15:48.014 --> 15:51.985
(sighs)
I'm still real sorry
about what happened.

15:52.019 --> 15:55.822
If there's anything
I can do to help,
just name it.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.657
Anything?

15:58.825 --> 16:00.493
Oh.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.662
You're not gonna go
and get yourself
in trouble now, are you?

16:02.695 --> 16:05.331
Or me? 'Cause your
sister's the Slayer.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.268
I'm a demon.
That's real good incentive
to get along with her.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.269
I need a demon
to help me.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.371
(sighs)

16:12.404 --> 16:16.143
-Spike would have.
-Spike's gone.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.649
DEMON:
You understand then?

16:22.682 --> 16:27.787
Yeah. Yeah, it's not like
you haven't been clear about it,
oh great, mysterious one.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.624
This is a test.
I don't get what I want
unless I pass said test.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.062
-About the size and shape.
-Yes.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.697
And since your pad
is decked out gladiator-style...

16:37.730 --> 16:40.399
and no number-two pencils
have been provided,

16:40.432 --> 16:43.102
I guess we're not
starting with the written.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.505
(sighs)

16:48.375 --> 16:50.409
Oh, here we go, then.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.778
Just me and the walking
action figure.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.849
I'm venturing this would be
the kill-or-be-killed
type of situation then?

16:56.883 --> 17:00.452
-To the death.
-Right.

17:01.921 --> 17:05.057
Here we are now.
Entertain us.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.928
Son of a--

17:14.300 --> 17:17.435
Rack's place
was right around here
last time.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.872
Huh-huh, I don't feel anything.
Oh, well, not here.
Let's go home.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.942
You don't feel anything
because his place moves.
I told you.

17:22.973 --> 17:26.377
Know why Rack
moves all the time?
Because he's shady.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.881
A bad element
comes down here.

17:28.914 --> 17:32.519
I get that, but Willow's
part of it now.
She is the element.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.521
If she isn't around somewhere,
Rack may know where she is,

17:35.555 --> 17:37.523
which is why
we need to talk to him.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.959
We? In a face-to-face way?

17:39.991 --> 17:43.296
Or me. I'll go in there
without you.
No, it's fine. I'm good.

17:43.329 --> 17:48.401
It's just Rack's not partial
to the floppy-eared.
He has a thing.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.037
But-- But, hey, I'm in.
Absolutely.

17:51.069 --> 17:53.705
Either way,
just get me there.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.544
Say Rack does know
where Willow is, he's not
gonna tell you for nothing.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.711
He's gonna want something.
I have money.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.980
(sighs)
That's not the kind
of something he's gonna want.

18:02.013 --> 18:05.050
-Rack likes little girls.
-I am not a little girl.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.287
I don't know if you've
thought this through.

18:07.319 --> 18:10.289
I'm supposed to keep you safe,
and this whole thing is--

18:10.323 --> 18:13.925
I mean, even
if you find Willow,

18:13.960 --> 18:16.462
you really think
you can stop her?

18:21.367 --> 18:23.736
Thanks, Anya,
for getting here so fast.
It's a big help.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.574
Once again,
Xander in need
of big help.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.777
Whatever.
So, can you still
sense Willow?

18:30.809 --> 18:34.480
Knowing her location
would be a real big comfort
right about now.

18:34.513 --> 18:38.518
No, I can't. Which means
whatever she's feeling has gone
way beyond simple vengeance.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.487
Did I mention me
needing the comfort?

18:40.519 --> 18:44.457
Whatever we got, grab it fast.
This is one of the first places
she's gonna look for us.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.626
Then what are we doing here?
You know, I could summon
a demon that would kill her.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.628
I could smack you
so hard, your eyeballs
would switch sockets.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.963
No one is getting killed.
Sit down.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.634
We need to find
some sort of magics

18:55.667 --> 18:57.636
that'll stop Willow
or at least slow her down.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.105
She drained the place.
Took everything.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.409
-Not everything.
-What is it?

19:03.843 --> 19:08.047
Um, a book
of protection spells.

19:08.079 --> 19:10.383
Anti-magic.
Our last resort.

19:10.416 --> 19:13.319
-You think you can
work this stuff?
-Ha, okay.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.556
Well, good news is
the text is intact.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.891
Bad news is, uh,
I can't read a word of it.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.160
It's, like, in ancient
Sumerian or something.

19:21.193 --> 19:24.063
-Could I take a look at it?
-Shut up.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.698
Right.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.470
I just thought,
you know, as long
as you're protecting us,

19:30.502 --> 19:32.971
the least I could do is--
I'm not protecting you,
Jonathan.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.875
None of us are.
We're doing this for Willow.

19:35.907 --> 19:38.978
The only reason it happens
to be your lucky day,

19:39.010 --> 19:43.349
is because Willow kills you,
she crosses a line,
I lose a friend.

19:44.916 --> 19:46.685
And I hate losing.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.887
I get that.

19:48.921 --> 19:52.592
It's just, you know,
she's running out
of power, right?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.661
I can tell.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.762
I can practically
feel it.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.865
I've dabbled
in magics.

19:58.897 --> 20:02.034
I think Willow's
in a league of her own
about now, dabble boy.

20:02.067 --> 20:05.538
But still,
running that hot
for that long,

20:05.571 --> 20:09.174
it's just a matter of time
before you gotta recharge,
no matter how juiced up you are.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.345
Thank you.
Now do you remember
that thing we talked about?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.413
About me shutting up?

20:14.446 --> 20:16.282
Right.

20:20.319 --> 20:21.554
Buffy.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.794
Buffy, let's say
this works,

20:27.826 --> 20:31.364
and we stop Willow from working
the hoodoo for a minute.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.300
What then?
I talk to her.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.769
Great. And say what?

20:40.673 --> 20:44.977
(sighs) Look,
whatever she's gonna do,
she starts with those two.

20:45.010 --> 20:48.047
They're the line
she cannot cross.

20:48.079 --> 20:50.717
And if she is running
low on magics,

20:50.750 --> 20:54.153
then she's probably
somewhere right now
trying to get it all back.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.499
Hey, babe.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.000
I've been waiting for you.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.442
Guess the rehab
didn't take, huh?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.877
That's the way it goes
sometimes.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.650
But I gotta say,

21:23.682 --> 21:27.953
I could feel
you coming a mile away,
the power you got.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.423
And you know something,
sweetness?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.559
I liked it.

21:35.227 --> 21:40.866
When you first came to me,
you were just a little
slip of a girl.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.868
Look at you now,

21:42.902 --> 21:47.239
so... growed up.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.377
So full of dark juice.

21:55.047 --> 21:58.518
And you still taste
like strawberries.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.720
Only now...

22:02.922 --> 22:04.757
you're ripe.

22:08.728 --> 22:11.698
You came because
you want something,

22:11.730 --> 22:13.865
don't you?

22:16.201 --> 22:18.003
I thought so.

22:20.271 --> 22:23.710
So tell me, Strawberry...

22:25.277 --> 22:28.114
what on this earth
do you want?

22:33.685 --> 22:36.087
Just to take
a little tour.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.023
(gasps, groans)

22:57.443 --> 23:00.413
Yea, Clem, making with
the demon senses.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.749
I knew you could
find this place.

23:02.781 --> 23:06.452
It's not very clean.
Don't wig out
on me again.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.921
It's just--
I'm still not so sure
you should be here.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.124
I'm not so sure
I should be here.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.826
It'll only take
a minute. Come on.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.298
You wanna wait here?

23:20.332 --> 23:22.801
-If that works for you.
-Be right back.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.609
(sighs)

23:39.586 --> 23:40.853
Willow?

23:47.125 --> 23:48.827
(screams)

23:50.529 --> 23:52.097
Hey, cutie.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.910
Dawnie, what are you
doing here?

24:03.942 --> 24:06.178
'Cause if you're looking for me,
now is not a great time.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.180
You look terrible.

24:08.213 --> 24:11.817
Do I?
You're back
on the magics.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.287
No, honey,
I am the magics.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.123
Did you kill that guy?

24:18.557 --> 24:20.425
It's an improvement,
believe me.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.294
I have to go.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.164
(screams)
Why?

24:26.198 --> 24:27.866
So you can run
and tell Buffy?

24:29.035 --> 24:32.337
Willow, please,
just listen to me.

24:32.371 --> 24:36.942
You don't have to talk.
Just think real loud.
I can hear you.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.211
You're freaking me out.

24:39.244 --> 24:43.449
Oh, don't be like that.
I'm just a little wired.

24:43.481 --> 24:47.886
And I have some things to do.
Thought if anybody'd
understand--

24:47.920 --> 24:49.822
I miss Tara, too.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.125
But this--
what you're doing here--

24:54.160 --> 24:56.295
this is not
the way to go.

24:56.327 --> 24:58.730
You're only going
to make things worse.

24:58.765 --> 25:01.968
But I promise,
it's not too late to--

25:02.000 --> 25:05.270
You miss her?
Yes.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.873
Did you cry?

25:08.406 --> 25:14.012
Of course you did.
I get that.
I understand the crying.

25:14.046 --> 25:17.482
You cry because you're human.
But you weren't always.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.385
Yes, I was.

25:20.419 --> 25:25.090
No, please.
You're telling me
you don't remember?

25:25.124 --> 25:29.095
You used to be some
mystic ball of energy.

25:30.429 --> 25:33.398
Maybe that's why you're
crying all the time, Dawnie.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.902
'Cause you don't belong here.

25:35.934 --> 25:39.838
Wanna go back?
End the pain?

25:39.872 --> 25:42.540
You'll be happier.
I'll be happier.

25:42.575 --> 25:47.113
We'll all be a lot happier
without listening
to the constant whining.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.017
Willow, stop.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.252
Mom. Buffy. Tara. Waah.

25:54.286 --> 25:57.589
It's time you go back to being
the little energy ball.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.292
No more tears, Dawnie.

26:02.994 --> 26:05.030
(pounding)

26:05.064 --> 26:08.233
I think you need
to get away from her.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.807
You're too close.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.910
How am I
supposed to read?
I don't know.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.179
I'm staring
right at this stuff,
and I can't read it.

26:21.681 --> 26:25.284
Well, how's the
translation coming?
What have we got so far?

26:27.252 --> 26:28.820
So far, we've got "the."

26:30.021 --> 26:34.226
Well, either
"the" or "towards."
I'm not really sure.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.328
I can't do this.
I'm in retail.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.431
Stupid ancient Sumerian.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.400
JONATHAN: I'm pretty sure
it's Babylonian.

26:41.432 --> 26:44.103
The text is similar,
but the dialect
is completely different.

26:44.135 --> 26:47.006
Great. Babylonian.
Thanks a bushel.

26:47.038 --> 26:51.009
But unless you can
read Babylonian,
why don't you sit back down?

26:58.317 --> 27:00.318
Why are you
helping them?

27:00.352 --> 27:02.922
Because they're saving
our lives, you moron.

27:02.954 --> 27:06.157
Uh-huh.
And what then?

27:06.192 --> 27:09.627
Even if they kill
that Wicca bitch, you think
they're just gonna let us walk?

27:09.662 --> 27:11.763
They own us.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.000
So what do you
want me to do?

27:14.032 --> 27:16.468
Look around.
You know magic.

27:16.501 --> 27:21.339
We're in a magic shop.
We can take them.

27:21.373 --> 27:26.545
The books are sucked dry, but
so what? There's still, like,
tons of supplies all around us.

27:26.577 --> 27:29.115
This is the best
chance we're gonna get
to make it out of here.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.383
And do what?

27:31.416 --> 27:33.786
Start over.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.288
We can be "The Duo,"
you and me.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.223
You can even
be the leader.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.026
I swear.
I'll take orders.

27:41.426 --> 27:45.263
I like taking orders.
Just tell me what to do.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.835
You want an order?

27:51.537 --> 27:53.239
Grow up.

27:53.271 --> 27:55.673
Hey, play nice, fellas,
or you'll break
our concentration.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.509
Which means
no protection spell.

27:57.542 --> 28:01.247
And Willow will make you
two boneless chickens
skinless too.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.414
And then what?

28:03.449 --> 28:06.853
Think your
little witch buddy's
gonna stop with us?

28:06.885 --> 28:10.422
You saw her.
She's a truck-driving
magic mama,

28:10.455 --> 28:14.359
and we've got maybe seconds
before Darth Rosenberg grinds
everybody into Jawa burgers.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.596
And not one of you bunch
has the midichlorians
to stop her.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.067
You've never
had any tiny bit
of sex, have you?

28:22.101 --> 28:24.871
The annoying virgin
has a point.

28:24.903 --> 28:28.007
What if Willow
filets their souls
and then comes after us?

28:28.039 --> 28:30.076
-XANDER: She won't.
-You don't know that.

28:30.108 --> 28:33.179
We're her friends,
Anya, her family.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.280
She would never hurt us.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.349
She tried to use you
for a hood ornament, Xander.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.219
She doesn't care
if you live or die.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.957
Guess you two finally
have something in common.

28:48.626 --> 28:51.096
I care if you
live or die, Xander.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.632
I'm just not sure
which one I want.

28:53.664 --> 28:55.467
Again with the comfort.

28:56.667 --> 29:00.105
Look, we both know
things might get ugly
at Wiccapalooza,

29:00.138 --> 29:02.141
and if it gets
really bad--

29:02.173 --> 29:04.109
Let me guess--
you'll propose?

29:06.112 --> 29:08.547
I need to know if you're
gonna turn on me,

29:08.579 --> 29:12.483
use this little shindig
as an excuse
for some sweet revenge.

29:12.518 --> 29:16.255
There is nothing in this world
that would give me greater
or more lasting satisfaction...

29:16.288 --> 29:19.458
than to reap bloody vengeance
upon you, Xander Harris.

29:19.490 --> 29:23.095
But I can't.
Not officially,
not magically.

29:23.128 --> 29:27.165
So smile, it's your lucky day.
You got away with it.
I can't hurt you.

29:27.199 --> 29:31.938
Right, 'cause you varnishing
the table with Spike, how could
that possibly have hurt?

29:31.971 --> 29:37.276
It may have chafed.
That wasn't vengeance.
It was solace.

29:42.347 --> 29:46.251
Look. I really
can't hurt you,

29:46.285 --> 29:49.055
so I'm just gonna have to
settle for hating you.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.490
If that's what you
need to do.
Don't!

29:52.523 --> 29:54.961
You don't get to
play the martyr.
I'm not.

29:54.993 --> 29:57.296
You know, none of this
would be happening
if it weren't for you.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.866
You think
I don't know that?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.001
You think I'm the hero
of this piece?

30:03.035 --> 30:04.971
I saw the gun...

30:06.404 --> 30:08.473
before Warren raised it.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.642
I-- I saw it,
and I couldn't move.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.846
He shot
two of my friends...

30:14.881 --> 30:17.148
before I could even...

30:17.182 --> 30:20.685
You want me to know
how useless I am?

30:20.719 --> 30:24.222
That it's my fault?
Thanks.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.224
I already
got the memo.

30:30.828 --> 30:32.364
I was talking about us.

30:38.203 --> 30:41.240
You need to back down a minute
and think, Wil.

30:41.272 --> 30:43.541
I wasn't gonna
hurt her, buzz kill.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.478
She tried
to turn me back.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.914
You're attacking the people
who love you now?

30:48.948 --> 30:52.018
WILLOW:
Only the ones in my way.

30:52.050 --> 30:55.487
That's not--
You need help.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.023
I'm doing fine
on my own, thanks.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.428
Dawn, get out of here. Go.

31:03.694 --> 31:07.598
Don't.
We're all friends.

31:07.633 --> 31:11.403
BUFFY: Willow, I know what
you wanna do, but you have to
listen to me.

31:11.436 --> 31:14.173
The forces inside you
are incredibly powerful.

31:14.205 --> 31:17.042
They're strong,
but you're stronger.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.546
You have to remember
you're still Willow.

31:20.578 --> 31:23.882
Let me tell you something
about Willow.

31:23.915 --> 31:27.519
She's a loser,
and she always has been.

31:27.553 --> 31:31.890
People picked on Willow
in junior high school,

31:31.923 --> 31:35.193
high school,
up until college,

31:35.227 --> 31:38.896
with her stupid
mousy ways.

31:38.931 --> 31:43.535
-And now Willow's a junkie.
-I can help.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.837
The only thing Willow
was ever good for,

31:48.640 --> 31:51.343
the only thing I had
going for me...

31:54.180 --> 31:57.950
were the moments,
just moments,

31:57.983 --> 32:01.752
when Tara would look at me,
and I was wonderful.

32:04.022 --> 32:07.259
And that will never
happen again.

32:07.292 --> 32:10.596
I know this hurts, bad,

32:10.628 --> 32:14.833
but, Willow, if you
let loose with the magics,
it'll never end.

32:14.865 --> 32:18.104
-Promise?
-You don't want that.

32:18.136 --> 32:21.440
-Why not?
-Because you'll
lose everything.

32:21.472 --> 32:23.842
Your friends, yourself.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.612
Willow, if you let this
control you,

32:26.644 --> 32:29.580
then the world goes away
and all of us with it.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.849
There's so much
to live for.

32:31.883 --> 32:35.753
Wil, there's too much to--

32:35.787 --> 32:38.824
Oh, please.
This is your pitch?

32:40.125 --> 32:42.594
Buffy, you hate it here
as much as I do.

32:42.627 --> 32:46.031
I'm just more honest
about it.
That's not true.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.634
You're trying to
sell me on the world?

32:48.666 --> 32:52.371
The one where you lie to
your friends when you're
not trying to kill them?

32:52.403 --> 32:55.673
And you screw a vampire
just to feel?

32:55.707 --> 32:59.310
And insane asylums are
the comfy alternative?

32:59.345 --> 33:03.115
This world?
Buffy, it's me.

33:03.148 --> 33:06.018
I know you were happier
when you were in the ground.

33:06.051 --> 33:08.686
The only time you were ever
at peace in your whole life

33:08.720 --> 33:10.821
was when you were dead.

33:10.855 --> 33:13.291
Until Willow
brought you back.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.527
You know, with magic.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.465
Aw. Sorry.

33:20.499 --> 33:24.603
The trip can be
kind of rough if you're,
you know, not me.

33:26.571 --> 33:28.006
Dawn.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.244
Jonathan. Andrew.

33:33.278 --> 33:36.582
You boys like magic,
don't you?

33:36.615 --> 33:38.616
Abracadabra.

33:50.096 --> 33:53.065
Okay, didn't see
that coming.

33:53.098 --> 33:56.102
What was that?
We're alive.

33:56.134 --> 34:00.538
You guys wanna take it slow?
I can do that, too.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.574
Ask Warren.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.143
Don't!

34:06.577 --> 34:08.980
(chanting in ancient language)

34:15.554 --> 34:17.456
Let's get outta here.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.628
WILLOW:
No, no. Stay.

34:23.661 --> 34:28.900
I mean, we're just
getting started.
I've got big party plans.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.103
Wil--
No, don't.

34:31.137 --> 34:35.806
Guys, come on.
I'm just getting the wood
for the violence here.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.510
And you know what they say--
"If at first
you don't succeed--"

34:44.650 --> 34:46.251
Had enough?

35:02.768 --> 35:05.371
Bad move, bad move,
bad move.

35:18.384 --> 35:20.552
Looks like local boy loses.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.190
So it would appear.

35:24.222 --> 35:27.025
Good on me then.

35:27.057 --> 35:30.429
I get what I came for.
I passed, right?

35:30.461 --> 35:35.666
Indeed, you have passed
the first stage of the test.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.235
Right. I get--

35:38.804 --> 35:40.871
Wait. First stage?

35:40.905 --> 35:44.242
-(laughs)
-Bugger.

35:49.181 --> 35:52.983
Damn, that is one
effective counter spell.

35:53.018 --> 35:55.987
-Won't keep you alive, though.
-Wil, stop.

35:56.021 --> 35:59.391
-You need to give this up now.
-I get it.

35:59.425 --> 36:03.528
You boys put a spell
on yourselves, didn't you,

36:03.561 --> 36:05.664
protecting you from harm,
from magics?

36:05.697 --> 36:07.666
That's cute.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.536
Wil, back off before
somebody gets hurt.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.538
How about I back off
right after?

36:12.570 --> 36:16.541
So, which one of you boys
worked the mojo?

36:16.574 --> 36:20.378
Doesn't matter, really.
I just-- I'm curious.

36:20.411 --> 36:22.681
(continues chanting)

36:25.784 --> 36:30.054
WILLOW: Just because I can't
do magics to you, doesn't mean
I can't do them on myself.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.123
(speaking Latin)

36:35.960 --> 36:39.431
Now I'm pretty sure
I'm strong enough
to beat you to death.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.608
I don't wanna hurt you.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.617
Not a problem.

37:05.222 --> 37:08.126
I said
I didn't want to.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.565
Didn't say I wouldn't.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.735
-Let's go.
-What about Willow?

37:16.768 --> 37:19.103
Buffy can handle her.
Are you sure?

37:19.137 --> 37:21.572
No, that's why
we're leaving. An?

37:21.606 --> 37:24.074
I can't. I have to
stay here to keep
the spell going on Willow.

37:24.108 --> 37:26.911
No, but--
Go! Do
something right.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.684
(continues chanting)

37:36.253 --> 37:37.523
No!

37:52.938 --> 37:56.907
So, here we are.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.943
Are we really gonna do this?

37:58.976 --> 38:02.447
Come on. This is
a huge deal for me.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.815
Six years as a sideman,

38:04.849 --> 38:07.418
now I get to
be the Slayer.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.655
A killer isn't a Slayer.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.324
Being a Slayer means something
you can't conceive of.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.795
Oh, Buffy.

38:16.827 --> 38:21.266
You really need to
have every square inch
of your ass kicked.

38:21.298 --> 38:23.501
Then show me what you got,

38:23.534 --> 38:26.304
and I'll show you
what a Slayer really is.

38:48.193 --> 38:51.362
Where are you taking us?
Someplace safe.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.364
Like where?
Xander?

38:55.065 --> 38:57.034
I don't know.

39:07.945 --> 39:10.114
Get off, superbitch.

39:26.297 --> 39:27.733
I can help you stop.

39:31.068 --> 39:33.938
I thought you were gonna
show me what a Slayer was.

39:36.907 --> 39:39.043
I can't... run anymore.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.514
I need to... breathe.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.916
If you
wanna keep breathing,
you gotta keep moving.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.219
This is bogus.
We gotta get out
of this town.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.556
Mexico. We should
go to Mexico.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.257
Hey, you're not
going anywhere.

39:53.291 --> 39:56.360
We're just gonna find a place
to hide you two until we get
the "all clear" from Buffy.

39:56.393 --> 39:58.463
Yeah?
What if the Slayer's
dead already?

39:58.496 --> 40:02.132
We're supposed to sit around
waiting for Sabrina to show up
and disembowel us?

40:02.166 --> 40:05.269
You do what I say to--
I don't think so.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.748
(Anya chanting)

40:20.652 --> 40:23.621
Well, hey, isn't
that interesting?

40:23.655 --> 40:25.791
Anya's still here.

40:27.693 --> 40:32.097
-(chanting)
-Looks like I've been
beating on the wrong gal.

40:32.130 --> 40:37.835
Whoa, whoa. Okay, Andy.
Let's just put
the sword down.

40:37.869 --> 40:41.840
Oh, no way. I-I'm not gonna
die because of something
I didn't even do.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.842
You're not gonna die.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.644
Leave him alone.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.447
Let him go, Andrew.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.018
You heard me.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.856
-You let me go first.
-Uh-uh. Him.

41:00.157 --> 41:04.329
It's your move.
No, yours.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.500
I'm not moving.

41:08.534 --> 41:10.768
I'm not gonna budge
'til... right now.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.369
Ow!

41:14.806 --> 41:18.543
Xander's right. We're
not leaving Sunnydale.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.378
When this is over,
you and I are going back
to jail to do our time.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.717
(gasps)
Help me!

41:27.052 --> 41:29.454
Help me!
You're hurting me.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.789
You can't block my spells
if you can't chant.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.159
And you can't chant
if you're sleepin'.

41:46.271 --> 41:49.907
Buffy,
I gotta tell you.
I get it now.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.844
The Slayer thing really
isn't about the violence.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.382
It's about the power.

42:09.460 --> 42:12.963
And there's no one in the world
who has the power
to stop me now.

42:20.137 --> 42:22.641
I'd like to
test that theory.
