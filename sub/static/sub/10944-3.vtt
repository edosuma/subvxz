00:02.700 --> 00:04.034
Ty:
You going somewhere?

00:04.102 --> 00:06.470
Matter of fact, I am.
Paris.

00:07.405 --> 00:09.072
There's someone there
I wanna see.

00:09.141 --> 00:10.774
Tim:
Okay, I have some news.

00:10.842 --> 00:12.809
<i>My son, Shane,</i>
<i>has been accepted</i>

00:12.877 --> 00:16.413
into a private school
for the gifted.

00:16.481 --> 00:18.314
I can stay here?

00:18.382 --> 00:20.383
Well, that's the thing.

00:20.451 --> 00:23.019
You can stay here
for the time being.

00:23.086 --> 00:25.021
I signed a bunch of papers
this afternoon

00:25.088 --> 00:26.989
that made that happen.

00:27.057 --> 00:28.991
Why don't
we get married?

00:29.059 --> 00:30.993
I mean, really,
why not?

00:31.061 --> 00:32.427
What if we just wait?

00:32.496 --> 00:35.797
I mean, it won't change
the way we feel if we wait.

00:41.070 --> 00:42.837
(Cows moo loudly)

00:42.905 --> 00:44.573
Tim:
Yeah! Come on, cow!

00:45.542 --> 00:47.176
Come on!
(Whistles)

00:49.412 --> 00:50.645
Jack:
Watch the edges there!

00:50.712 --> 00:51.979
Tim: Oh, come on,
give me a break!

00:52.047 --> 00:53.281
Jack: Then get your
head out of the grass!

00:53.348 --> 00:55.983
What is with you
this morning?

00:56.051 --> 00:57.818
Tim:
Nothin'.

00:57.886 --> 01:00.120
Miranda called last night.

01:00.189 --> 01:02.990
She wants to come for a visit
with Shane next week.

01:03.058 --> 01:05.226
Jack: That's a good
thing, isn't it?

01:05.294 --> 01:06.859
Tim:
Yeah, it would be,

01:06.927 --> 01:08.961
except I know she wants to talk
about tuition.

01:09.029 --> 01:10.363
Now wait a minute.

01:10.431 --> 01:12.765
You wouldn't shut up
about how that school

01:12.833 --> 01:14.534
was the best thing
for his future.

01:14.602 --> 01:16.936
She's gonna sell her car
to pay her share, Jack.

01:17.004 --> 01:19.673
Right, so it's her share
you're concerned about.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.541
Tim:
I am.

01:21.609 --> 01:23.542
I just don't know
how I'm gonna pay mine.

01:23.610 --> 01:24.910
Jack:

01:49.702 --> 01:51.636
Thank you.
I owe you big time.

01:51.704 --> 01:52.870
Oh, I'm sure I can
think of a way

01:56.241 --> 01:58.342
It's not that
big a deal.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.776
It's my job, Amy.

01:59.844 --> 02:01.478
No, I don't mean that.

02:01.546 --> 02:03.980
Scott knows what it's like
to study for finals.

02:04.048 --> 02:07.117
And hold down a job
at the same time?

02:07.184 --> 02:10.220
You sure everything else
is all right?

02:10.287 --> 02:11.420
Yeah,
everything's fine.

02:11.488 --> 02:15.358
It's just I am...
Very late.

02:15.425 --> 02:16.792
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:16.860 --> 02:17.893
I'll give you
a call later.

02:17.961 --> 02:19.595
- See you.
- Okay.

02:22.499 --> 02:24.300

Perfect! Thank you.

car horn honks)

02:38.748 --> 02:40.348
Whoa! Whoa!

02:41.284 --> 02:42.150
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:43.551 --> 02:44.951

02:45.019 --> 02:46.253
Whoa.

02:46.321 --> 02:48.622
Jack:
What is going on here?

02:50.124 --> 02:52.760
Sorry, guys, looks like
I spooked 'em a little.

02:52.827 --> 02:55.763
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Well, a car horn</i>
<i>tends to do that.</i>

02:55.830 --> 02:56.863
<i>Tim:</i> <i>What do you think</i>
<i>you're doin'</i>

02:56.931 --> 02:57.964
tearin' the grass up
like that?!

02:58.032 --> 02:59.532
Lou said you guys
would be out here.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.933
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Lou?</i>

03:01.001 --> 03:02.368
My daughter, Lou?
How do you know her?

03:02.436 --> 03:04.404
I'm staying in one
of her cabins.

03:04.471 --> 03:07.907
I thought I'd come see a couple
of real cowboys in action.

03:07.974 --> 03:11.277
Well, this isn't some kind
of Western safari, y'know.

03:11.345 --> 03:14.013
Trucks kill the grass;
That's why we use horses.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.146
Right.

03:16.148 --> 03:17.849
Sorry.

03:17.917 --> 03:20.218
Name's Lanny Barrick,
by the way.

03:20.286 --> 03:23.722
With any luck,
we just might be neighbours.

I thought I was pickin' you up
at the airport this afternoon.

04:26.214 --> 04:27.348
I caught
an earlier flight

04:27.416 --> 04:28.115
'cause I couldn't wait

Hi, honey.

04:41.261 --> 04:43.196
Hey, by the way,

04:43.264 --> 04:44.563
thanks for sending
that yahoo out

04:44.631 --> 04:46.132
in the monster truck
to see us.

Lou:
What? Who? Lanny Barrick?

04:48.102 --> 04:49.870
Lisa: Lanny Barrick?
That's an old friend of mine.

04:49.937 --> 04:52.671
I met him back when he was
starting his little oil company.

04:52.739 --> 04:54.172
Lou:
Well, I might have mentioned

04:54.240 --> 04:55.775
that you guys were out there
moving some cattle.

04:55.809 --> 04:58.711
<i>He's obsessed with becoming</i>
<i>a weekend cowboy.</i>

04:58.779 --> 05:00.078
He lives in Calgary,

05:00.146 --> 05:01.547
but he's out here
doing some ranch shopping.

05:01.615 --> 05:03.348
An expensive hobby.

05:03.417 --> 05:05.885
<i>Lisa:</i> <i>Well, he doesn't have
to worry;</i> <i>He's loaded.</i>

05:05.952 --> 05:06.984
How loaded?

05:07.052 --> 05:08.420
Lisa:
His "little" oil company

05:08.487 --> 05:10.288
is now one of the top ten
producers in all of Alberta.

05:11.557 --> 05:14.125
Really.

05:14.192 --> 05:15.493
Well, I gotta go.

05:15.561 --> 05:16.694
Good to see you,
Lisa.

05:16.762 --> 05:17.896
You too.

05:18.798 --> 05:21.666
Tim: Hey, kid.
Georgie: Hey.

05:21.734 --> 05:24.367
Hey, why aren't you in school?

05:24.436 --> 05:26.837
You told me to finish
my chores first.

05:26.905 --> 05:29.940
<i>Jack:</i> <i>That was before school</i>
<i>and you knew what I meant.</i>

05:30.007 --> 05:31.642
Come on,
I'll take you in.

05:31.709 --> 05:33.544
Well, I have to change
my clothes.

05:33.611 --> 05:37.915
Jack: There's no time for that.
Get in the truck now.

05:40.283 --> 05:42.552
Lise, I'm sorry.
I won't be too long.

05:42.619 --> 05:45.621
I won't be too long.
Just...

05:45.689 --> 05:46.656
Lisa:
Uh...

05:46.723 --> 05:48.190
- Hey.
- Who is that?

05:48.258 --> 05:50.626
- Hi.
- That's Georgie.

05:50.694 --> 05:52.428
What?
Grampa hasn't told you?

05:52.496 --> 05:54.463
No, he told me nothing.

05:55.631 --> 05:56.932
(Truck rumbles)

06:04.740 --> 06:06.107
Lanny: You come to
yell at me some more?

06:06.175 --> 06:07.776
(Chuckles)
No, no, not at all.

06:07.844 --> 06:10.744
Sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

06:10.812 --> 06:12.813
I wanted to introduce
myself properly.

06:12.881 --> 06:14.381
Tim Fleming.

06:14.449 --> 06:15.783
Welcome to Hudson.

06:15.851 --> 06:17.084
Thank you.

06:17.151 --> 06:18.552
My daughter, Lou,
was telling me

06:18.620 --> 06:19.787
you might be looking
for a ranch around here.

06:19.855 --> 06:22.255
Uh, I don't know,
I'm having second thoughts.

06:22.323 --> 06:25.392
I saw a place today
with some rotten little shack

06:25.460 --> 06:27.694
they were passing off
as a ranch house.

06:27.761 --> 06:29.328
I don't know what my realtor
was thinking.

06:29.396 --> 06:31.531
I've been livin' round here
for most of my life.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.734
Let me tell ya,
there's some nice places.

06:34.802 --> 06:35.935
Well, maybe that's
what I need -

06:36.003 --> 06:37.403
a guy like you.

06:37.471 --> 06:38.437
A guy like me?

06:38.506 --> 06:40.172
Yeah, a cowboy,

06:40.240 --> 06:42.074
a guy's who's worked the land,
knows the cattle business.

06:42.142 --> 06:44.075
You could help me find
my dream ranch.

06:44.143 --> 06:47.445
Yeah, I could give you
my professional opinion.

06:47.514 --> 06:49.548
- I could fire my realtor-
- Well, I wouldn't-

06:49.616 --> 06:51.449
Maybe I'd pay you
a finder's fee.

06:51.518 --> 06:53.552
Let's say 3 percent
of the purchase price?

06:53.620 --> 06:55.521
That's generous.

06:55.588 --> 06:56.788
Well, it's my pleasure.

06:56.856 --> 06:57.689
Of course, if you're
uncomforatable with 3,

06:57.757 --> 06:59.189
I could knock it down
to 2.

06:59.257 --> 07:00.625
No, no, I'm comfortable.
I'm good, I'm good with-

07:00.692 --> 07:01.726
that's fine.
(Chuckles)

07:01.793 --> 07:04.328
Sounds great.
(Chuckles)

07:04.396 --> 07:06.430
Lanny: Hey, Paige.
This is Mr. Fleming.

07:06.498 --> 07:07.732
<i>He's gonna find us</i>
<i>our dream ranch.</i>

07:07.799 --> 07:09.000
Oh, hello.

07:09.067 --> 07:10.768
Hello.

07:10.836 --> 07:12.737
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna try.</i>

07:12.804 --> 07:15.138
Say, we're having a dinner
up at the house tonight.

07:15.205 --> 07:17.641
It's a welcome home party
for Lisa.

07:17.708 --> 07:18.608
You and your daughter
would be welcome

07:18.676 --> 07:20.209
<i>as our guests.</i>

07:20.277 --> 07:21.811
Daughter?
(Chuckles)

07:21.879 --> 07:23.914
Mr. Fleming...

07:23.981 --> 07:25.415
Paige is my wife.

07:27.752 --> 07:29.920
(Embarrased chuckle)
(Chuckles)

07:35.091 --> 07:36.324
Hey, what's up?

07:36.392 --> 07:38.160
Amy: Hey, um, I know
I just saw you,

07:38.227 --> 07:40.395
but I totally forgot
I need some West Nile vaccine.

07:40.463 --> 07:43.498
Oh, I can grab that for ya.

07:43.566 --> 07:45.033
Right here.
There you go.

07:45.101 --> 07:46.234
Awesome!
Thank you.

07:46.302 --> 07:47.469
You're welcome.

07:48.438 --> 07:50.072
Ty, um...

07:50.139 --> 07:51.306
I know you said it is,

07:51.374 --> 07:53.741
and I hate to keep asking,
but...

07:53.809 --> 07:55.143
Is everything
really okay?

07:55.211 --> 07:56.611
It's fine.

07:58.246 --> 08:00.314
But I actually wish
you'd quit asking me that.

08:00.382 --> 08:01.348
I think it'd be
a whole lot better

08:01.416 --> 08:02.584
if we could just...

08:02.651 --> 08:04.552
Go back to being normal
with each other.

08:04.620 --> 08:06.087
Okay, I'm sorry.

08:06.154 --> 08:07.521
It's okay.

08:08.591 --> 08:10.658
Thank you for this.

08:16.230 --> 08:19.032
Sorry about that.
That girl...

08:19.100 --> 08:20.767
Mm-hmm, Georgie.

08:20.835 --> 08:21.835
Yeah.

08:21.903 --> 08:24.337
Yeah, Lou told me
all about her.

08:24.405 --> 08:25.739
Why didn't you?

08:26.708 --> 08:28.041
Well...

08:28.976 --> 08:30.342
It's a complicated
situation

08:30.410 --> 08:33.011
and I didn't really
wanna get into it over the phone.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.148
Jack, you're raising
a foster child?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.484
Well, I suppose I am.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.586
It's only temporary

08:40.654 --> 08:43.188
until they can find her
a proper home.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.624
I wanna hear all about you
and the rest of your trip.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.827
Well, I wanna tell you,
but you know what?

08:48.894 --> 08:50.394
At this point,
I gotta go.

08:50.462 --> 08:51.863
I have so much to get
caught up on and I-

08:51.931 --> 08:53.264
But you just got here!

08:53.332 --> 08:55.133
No! You just got here!

08:55.200 --> 08:58.503
I've been here all morning
waiting for you.

08:58.570 --> 09:01.171
But I will see you at dinner
and I'll tell you everything.

09:01.239 --> 09:02.706
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:06.911 --> 09:09.113
Scott: Hey, thanks for
hustling out the BVD vaccine.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.948
Ty:
Yeah, no problem.

09:16.954 --> 09:18.487
There we go.

09:19.422 --> 09:20.489
(Sighs)

09:22.059 --> 09:23.159
Whoa!
Hold on a second!

09:23.226 --> 09:25.762
What's wrong?
Uh...

09:25.829 --> 09:27.196
I brought the wrong one.

09:27.264 --> 09:28.330
I gotta go back
to the clinic.

09:28.398 --> 09:31.333
You brought
the live vaccine?

09:31.401 --> 09:32.701
You know
what would've happened

09:32.769 --> 09:35.236
if I would've injected this
into a pregnant cow?

09:35.304 --> 09:37.205
Yeah, I know.

09:37.273 --> 09:38.807
Look...

09:38.875 --> 09:41.943
I know you're stressed out,
I get that,

09:42.011 --> 09:46.548
but I really need you
to be on top of your game.

09:46.615 --> 09:48.916
I'm sorry, Scott.
It won't happen again.

09:48.984 --> 09:50.384
I promise.

09:53.055 --> 09:53.954
Lanny:
This is delicious, Lou.

09:54.022 --> 09:55.222
Lou:
Oh, thank you.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.657
Paige:
These biscuits are so fluffy!

09:56.725 --> 09:58.826
Lou: Cake flour and
shortening is the secret.

09:58.894 --> 10:01.862
Tim: I thought you might enjoy a
good ol' fashioned country meal.

10:02.798 --> 10:05.699
Jack: So you're lookin' for
a cattle ranch, Lanny?

10:05.766 --> 10:07.400
Lanny:
Yeah. Just a little place

10:07.467 --> 10:10.236
to help us get outta the city
on the weekend.

10:10.304 --> 10:12.405
Tim's gonna help us find it.

10:12.472 --> 10:14.440
Really.

10:14.809 --> 10:17.944
<i>Paige:</i> <i>We're thinking a log
house</i> <i>with an open beam concept,</i>

10:18.012 --> 10:19.512
<i>a rundle rock fireplace,</i>

10:19.580 --> 10:21.447
a deck with a mountain view,

10:21.515 --> 10:24.317
and... oh, a pool pavilion
would be amazing.

10:24.384 --> 10:27.220
Wow! You sound just like
the women on those TV shows.

10:27.287 --> 10:28.621
<i>Paige:</i>
<i>I have to admit,</i>

10:28.689 --> 10:29.955

I mean,
"The Real Housewives of-

10:31.425 --> 10:32.925
Lou:
Georgie, did you have a biscuit?

10:34.794 --> 10:36.562
Lanny: Lou, we really love
that dude ranch of yours.

10:36.630 --> 10:37.962
Thank you.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.631
Actually, Lisa and I are
partners on it.

10:39.699 --> 10:42.467
Well, you pretty much run
that place on your own, at this point,

10:42.535 --> 10:45.537
while holding down a job
as a financial adivsor, I might add.

10:45.605 --> 10:46.938
Where at?

10:47.005 --> 10:48.506
Lou: Hubbard Financial.
(Door opens)

10:48.574 --> 10:49.674
You and I should talk.

10:49.742 --> 10:51.175
Absolutely!
In fact-

10:51.244 --> 10:54.811
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Sorry I'm late.
</i> <i>I was studying.</i>

10:54.879 --> 10:56.213
<i>Hey.</i>

10:56.281 --> 10:57.314
Hi.

10:57.382 --> 10:59.316
So what are you
studying to be?

10:59.384 --> 11:00.584
Uh, a vet.

11:00.652 --> 11:03.254
<i>Lanny:</i>
<i>Oh, good career.</i>

11:03.321 --> 11:04.788
And you, Amy,
are you in university?

11:04.856 --> 11:07.591
No, I, um...
I work with horses.

11:07.659 --> 11:10.526
You hear that Paige?
Another horse-crazy gal.

11:10.594 --> 11:11.728
Do you ride too?

11:11.795 --> 11:12.962
- Well, I-
- Hell, yeah.

11:13.029 --> 11:14.163
She's a cowgirl
through and through.

11:14.231 --> 11:15.265
She was riding
before she could walk.

11:16.933 --> 11:18.200
The first thing
we're gonna do

11:18.269 --> 11:20.803
when we find ourselves
this dream ranch,

11:20.871 --> 11:22.037
is get you a horse,

11:22.105 --> 11:23.339
<i>a real beauty.</i>

11:23.407 --> 11:24.807
Yeah?

11:24.875 --> 11:27.509
You know, I might just have
the horse for you.

11:27.577 --> 11:29.511
You free tomorrow,
Amy?

11:30.480 --> 11:31.713
Yeah, I could be.

11:31.781 --> 11:34.048
Good. We'll do a little
show-and-tell.

11:34.116 --> 11:35.917
<i>Lanny:</i>
<i>That sounds good.</i>

11:35.985 --> 11:37.185
What's this horse's name?

11:37.253 --> 11:38.987
Lightning Dexter.

11:39.054 --> 11:40.689
I like him already.

11:48.062 --> 11:49.697
Tim: He used to be a
champion race horse.

11:49.765 --> 11:51.098
Lanny:
Really?

11:51.166 --> 11:52.566
Won me a lot of money.

11:53.568 --> 11:55.135
After I retired him,

11:55.203 --> 11:57.671
I had Amy re-train him
as a hunter jumper.

11:57.738 --> 11:59.806
Wow. He's gorgeous.

11:59.873 --> 12:01.908
But I'm not really
planning to jump.

12:01.975 --> 12:04.210
Great trail horse too.

12:05.145 --> 12:06.846
Why don't you take it
for a spin?

12:06.914 --> 12:07.980
I'd love to,

12:08.048 --> 12:09.982
but I didn't bring
any of my gear.

12:11.519 --> 12:13.052
Lanny:
So how much you want for him?

12:13.120 --> 12:16.021
Tim:
Oh... I don't know.

12:16.989 --> 12:18.424
At least forty.

12:19.091 --> 12:20.793
Since I'm already throwing
some business your way,

12:20.860 --> 12:22.795
why not knock it down
to 25?

12:22.862 --> 12:24.232
(Sighs)

12:24.362 --> 12:26.432
I don't know
if I could take that hit.

12:29.802 --> 12:32.236
Say thirty,
you got a deal.

12:34.606 --> 12:37.107
All right. Deal.
(Surprised gasp)

12:38.610 --> 12:40.244
Paige: Lanny, I just
need a trail horse.

12:40.312 --> 12:42.012
It's only the best for you,
honey.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.113
Paige:

12:48.118 --> 12:49.419
(Tires screech)

12:51.356 --> 12:52.422
(Tires squeal)

12:56.527 --> 12:57.761
Who are you

12:57.829 --> 12:59.629
and what are you doing
on my horse?

13:06.998 --> 13:10.868
<i>Jack:</i> <i>That does sound like a lot</i>
<i>of money for that horse.</i>

13:10.936 --> 13:13.370
Amy: Mallory, hi! Welcome home!

13:13.438 --> 13:15.939
Jack: We didn't expect you
for a couple of weeks.

13:16.006 --> 13:18.808
Mallory, oh!

13:18.876 --> 13:21.677
So Nashville's not all your dad
thought it was, huh?

13:21.745 --> 13:23.012
No, it wasn't.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.314
His new label jerked him around
a lot

13:24.381 --> 13:25.681
so he dumped them.

13:25.749 --> 13:27.116
Now he's building a studio
in our garage.

13:27.184 --> 13:28.117
(Chuckles)

13:28.435 --> 13:29.768
Now explain,

13:29.836 --> 13:31.637
why is some strange girl
riding Copper?

13:31.705 --> 13:33.671
Oh, that's Georgie.

13:33.739 --> 13:35.740
I said she could take him out
this morning before school,

13:35.808 --> 13:37.909
but that was well over
an hour ago.

13:37.977 --> 13:39.177
Who the heck is Georgie?

13:39.245 --> 13:41.913
You just saw her now?
Where is she?!

13:41.981 --> 13:43.248
She was going up
the driveway.

13:43.316 --> 13:45.417
That girl!

13:45.485 --> 13:48.086
Hello? Who is Georgie?
What is going on here?

13:48.153 --> 13:49.353
Okay,
I will fill you in later,

13:49.421 --> 13:50.521
but right now I have
to deal with a woman

13:50.589 --> 13:52.323
who paid a lot of money
for a horse.

13:57.828 --> 14:01.097
Wow, you look like hell.
You up studying all night?

14:01.165 --> 14:03.399
Yeah, pretty much.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.701
Well, I'm heading off
to the polo club.

14:05.769 --> 14:06.802
I need you to take care

14:06.870 --> 14:09.739
of a couple of things
around here.

14:09.806 --> 14:12.040
There's an Australian Shepherd
that needs its nails clipped,

14:12.108 --> 14:14.009
and there's a horse
in the isolation stall

14:14.076 --> 14:15.377
that needs its IV changed.

14:15.445 --> 14:17.812
(Sleepily)
No problem.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.348
<i>Scott:</i> <i>Just call me</i>
<i>if you need anything.</i>

14:19.415 --> 14:20.349
Okay.

14:20.416 --> 14:22.050
Oh, yeah,

14:22.118 --> 14:24.085
there will be a woman coming by
to pick up her dog's ashes.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.889
Old Buster,
he finally bought the farm.

14:28.691 --> 14:30.191
<i>Ty:</i> <i>(Yawning)</i> <i>Okay.</i>

14:30.259 --> 14:31.492
See you later.

14:33.629 --> 14:34.829
(Yawns loudly)

14:36.766 --> 14:39.000
(Rain patters down,
kids chatter)

14:39.068 --> 14:42.336
Jack: Okay, get a move on.
I'm already late to see Lisa.

14:42.404 --> 14:43.437
Again.

14:48.710 --> 14:49.777
Something wrong?

14:51.245 --> 14:55.049
<i>You're not having trouble</i>
<i>in class are ya?</i>

14:56.017 --> 14:57.851
You know,
I didn't exactly love school

14:57.919 --> 15:00.053
when I was your age either,

15:00.120 --> 15:01.420
especially the math.

15:01.488 --> 15:04.290
I could never wrap my head
around geometry.

15:04.357 --> 15:06.759
I'm not having troubles
in class.

15:06.827 --> 15:09.195
Then what then?
Your teacher?

15:09.262 --> 15:10.830
She's all right.

15:10.898 --> 15:12.565
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>The other kids?</i>

15:12.632 --> 15:16.234
They're okay,
except for Kyle Suffield.

15:16.302 --> 15:19.938
Why? Is he pickin' on you
or somethin'?

15:20.006 --> 15:22.407
- Hey, hey.
- I have to go.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.476
What's going on
with this Kyle kid?

15:25.544 --> 15:26.878
Nothing!

15:26.946 --> 15:30.315
You're the one
that mentioned him.

15:31.883 --> 15:33.084
Is he some kind of bully
or somethin',

15:33.151 --> 15:34.484
'cause if that's what's
goin' on here-

15:34.552 --> 15:35.786
Okay!

15:35.854 --> 15:38.122
He says I dress like a boy.
That's all!

15:38.190 --> 15:40.657
I can deal with it,
all right?

15:43.661 --> 15:45.362
(Birds chirp)

15:45.430 --> 15:48.364
Amy: Okay, now just use your
reins to keep him straight,

15:48.432 --> 15:50.133
collect up on him a bit.

15:50.201 --> 15:51.768
Paige: I know how to ride a horse!
What's wrong with him?

15:51.836 --> 15:53.837
Amy: He just has a bit of
that race track mentality.

15:53.904 --> 15:55.438
<i>Just keep your legs off him</i>
<i>and your hands still.</i>

15:55.505 --> 15:56.806
Whoa!
What do you mean?!

15:56.874 --> 15:57.807
Easy, Paige!

15:57.875 --> 15:59.142
Paige:
Help me! Agh!

15:59.210 --> 16:00.710
Amy:
Easy, just circle up!

16:00.778 --> 16:01.778
<i>Paige:</i>
<i>Help!</i>

16:01.846 --> 16:02.545
Amy:
Paige, pull on your reins!

16:02.613 --> 16:03.246
Paige:
What?!

16:03.313 --> 16:04.312
Amy:
Pull it!

16:04.380 --> 16:05.147
Paige:
Whoa! Whoa! Oh my God!

16:05.215 --> 16:06.448
Amy:
It's okay. Whoa.

16:06.515 --> 16:09.184
Paige: Get me off this horse!
Please!

16:09.252 --> 16:11.686
Amy: It's okay, it's okay.
Take it easy, Dexter.

16:11.755 --> 16:12.921
Paige:
(Gasps)

16:15.925 --> 16:17.192
He's still not back yet?

16:17.260 --> 16:19.161
Nope.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.795
I'm sure he has
a very good reason.

16:20.863 --> 16:22.997
Oh, I'm sure he does.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.666
So, Lisa, um,
that Lanny guy last night,

16:25.734 --> 16:27.568
was he just blowing smoke
or what?

16:27.636 --> 16:29.003
No, that's Lanny.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.139
I think when it comes
to his business,

16:31.206 --> 16:32.439
<i>or a ranch,</i>

16:32.507 --> 16:34.175
or even a buying a horse
for his wife,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.376
he's gonna make damn sure

16:35.443 --> 16:37.010
he has the best
of what's going.

16:37.078 --> 16:38.311
Mmm-hmm.

16:38.379 --> 16:39.679
'Cause at one point
he said we should talk.

16:39.747 --> 16:41.314
I caught that.
That's kind of exciting.

16:41.382 --> 16:43.116
I would love to look
at his portfolio.

16:43.184 --> 16:44.717
You would.
(Chuckles)

16:44.786 --> 16:45.919
But let me give you
a little bit of advice

16:45.987 --> 16:47.988
about dealing with him.

16:48.055 --> 16:49.856
He kind of flies
by the seat of his pants.

16:49.924 --> 16:52.425
So make sure you're the one
that follows up.

16:52.493 --> 16:54.994
Right. Thanks.

16:55.061 --> 16:56.962

16:57.998 --> 16:59.666
Lou:
(Clears throat)

17:02.169 --> 17:04.136
It was you that asked me
to come here

right?

17:06.106 --> 17:07.906
Yeah, yeah, I, uh...

17:07.973 --> 17:10.776
Oh, the time kinda got away
on me a bit there.

17:10.843 --> 17:12.344
Let me guess...

17:12.412 --> 17:13.612
Yeah, Georgie.

17:15.981 --> 17:19.050
I was just gonna drop her off
and then scoot right home,

17:19.117 --> 17:21.353
but, well, then she told me
about this kid

17:21.421 --> 17:23.855
that's been teasin'
her pretty hard,

17:23.923 --> 17:25.255
and it turns out
that's the reason

17:25.324 --> 17:27.023
that she's been
avoiding school,

17:27.090 --> 17:29.660
so I had a bit of a chat
with her teacher about it and...

17:29.728 --> 17:30.994
I wanna hear all about it,

17:31.062 --> 17:32.630
but now I have to go

18:27.549 --> 18:29.115
Mrs. Roche:
(Shrieks)

18:30.084 --> 18:31.918
Oh my God!

18:31.986 --> 18:33.052
Oh my God!

18:33.120 --> 18:34.554
Scott:
What's going on here?

18:34.622 --> 18:36.523
I just gave her
Sparky's ashes.

18:36.591 --> 18:37.957
She's in shock.

18:38.025 --> 18:39.393
Scott:
Ty...

18:39.460 --> 18:43.463
I'm sorry, Ms. Roche.
Sparky is the Shepherd

18:43.531 --> 18:46.064
who needed to get
his nails trimmed.

18:46.132 --> 18:47.767
<i>There's been</i>
<i>a misunderstanding</i>

18:47.834 --> 18:49.735
and Sparky's just fine.

18:50.970 --> 18:52.337
I am so sorry.

18:52.406 --> 18:54.940
This is my fault.
I mixed up the names.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.174
He's fine.
I'll go grab him now.

18:56.242 --> 18:57.610
<i>He's okay.</i>

19:02.581 --> 19:03.981
You okay?

19:04.049 --> 19:06.050
I can't believe you
let me get on that crazy horse!

19:06.118 --> 19:08.219
- Excuse me?
- He's un-ridable!

19:08.287 --> 19:09.587
There is nothing wrong
with Dexter,

19:09.655 --> 19:10.922
but he does need
an experienced rider,

19:10.989 --> 19:12.657
which is what you told me
you were.

19:12.725 --> 19:14.058
It's been a while,
but I am an experienced-

19:14.126 --> 19:15.326
Oh, come on, Paige.

19:15.394 --> 19:16.427
I could see
as soon as you got on

19:16.494 --> 19:17.628
that you were green.

19:17.695 --> 19:19.229
So first,
you almost kill me

19:19.297 --> 19:21.264
and now you're insulting
my riding skills?

19:21.332 --> 19:24.401
I do this for a living,
Paige.

19:27.939 --> 19:29.807
If you really are serious
about buying a horse,

19:29.874 --> 19:31.842
maybe I can give you
some riding lessons,

19:31.910 --> 19:34.444
if you want to learn.

19:34.511 --> 19:36.145
Yeah, yes.

19:36.212 --> 19:37.947
But it's not gonna be
on Dexter.

19:38.014 --> 19:41.016
It's gonna be on a horse
that matches your ability.

19:41.084 --> 19:42.518
(Sighs)

19:42.586 --> 19:45.688
Okay, but please don't tell
Lanny we're switching horses.

19:45.756 --> 19:46.989
He's gonna find out
eventually.

19:47.057 --> 19:48.023
Not yet.

19:48.091 --> 19:50.625
Just let me deal
with that.

19:52.495 --> 19:53.562
Okay.

19:54.664 --> 19:55.697
(Knocking)

20:00.570 --> 20:01.503
(Door opens)

20:01.571 --> 20:02.704
Lou:
Oh, hi.

20:02.772 --> 20:04.139
I was just on my way home
from work

20:04.207 --> 20:06.640
and thought you might use
some extra towels.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.909
Actually, we have plenty,
but thank you.

20:08.978 --> 20:10.078
Oh, okay.

20:11.447 --> 20:12.613
I'll be getting home then.

20:12.681 --> 20:14.082
I have some more work to do
before dinner.

20:14.149 --> 20:15.316
Oh.
At Hubbard Financial,

20:15.384 --> 20:17.551
it's never just
an eight-hour day.

20:17.619 --> 20:18.987
We're always working hard

20:19.054 --> 20:20.254
to make our client's money
work hard for them.

20:20.322 --> 20:21.288
You know what I mean?

20:21.356 --> 20:23.123
Yes, I do know
what you mean.

20:23.191 --> 20:24.291
Something told me

20:24.359 --> 20:27.560
this was about more
than clean towels.

20:27.628 --> 20:31.831
Yes, it is, and I apologize.
I'm overstepping my bounds.

20:31.899 --> 20:32.966
Don't you apologize.

20:33.034 --> 20:36.269
It was me
who suggested that we talk.

20:36.337 --> 20:38.437
The truth is
I'm frustrated.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.473
My advisors have
been giving me

20:40.540 --> 20:42.708
dinky returns
on my investments.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.177
Well, maybe there's something
we can do to change that.

20:45.245 --> 20:48.247
I mean, I would be happy
to look at your portfolio.

20:48.315 --> 20:51.417
Well, a second set of eyes
never hurt.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.718
All right,

20:53.785 --> 20:55.186
I'll send you over
my financials.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.321
Great.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.094
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Somehow I mixed up the
files</i> <i>and the names!</i>

21:03.162 --> 21:04.262
(Laughing)
No, no, no!

21:04.330 --> 21:06.431
Ty:
It's not funny, Amy!

21:06.499 --> 21:07.999
You should have seen
the look on her face!

21:08.067 --> 21:09.633
She was horrified!

21:09.700 --> 21:10.700
Both:
(Laughing)

21:10.768 --> 21:11.835
This is really
not funny!

21:11.903 --> 21:13.370
Come on!

21:13.438 --> 21:14.371
Amy:
(Laughs hysterically)

21:14.439 --> 21:16.140
Aw, it was horrible!

21:17.675 --> 21:19.076
I could lose my job
over this.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.511
You're not gonna lose
your job, okay?

21:20.578 --> 21:22.579
It was an honest mistake.

21:22.647 --> 21:23.914
You'll go into work tomorrow

21:23.981 --> 21:26.049
and everything will be back
to normal.

21:26.116 --> 21:27.983
- I hope so.
- It will be, okay?

21:28.052 --> 21:29.185
I really hope so.

21:29.253 --> 21:31.220
Both:
(Laughing hysterically)

21:31.288 --> 21:33.322
Ty: (Groans)
Amy: (Continues laughing)

21:38.128 --> 21:39.762
Ty:
Uh, hi.

21:39.829 --> 21:42.597
Hi there.
Can I help you?

21:42.665 --> 21:45.434
Uh, I work here.
Who are you?

21:46.402 --> 21:47.769
Cassandra Fay.

21:48.704 --> 21:52.040
Cassandra, um, I'm Ty.
What are you, uh,

21:52.108 --> 21:53.241
what're you doing
back here exactly?

21:53.309 --> 21:56.678
Oh, I'm Scott's
new vet assistant.

22:03.108 --> 22:05.276
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Hey, , how'd the ride go</i>
<i>with Paige yesterday?</i>

22:05.344 --> 22:06.678
She love Dexter or what?

22:06.745 --> 22:09.780
Uh, actually, she-
(Car horn blasts)

22:09.847 --> 22:12.783
Tim: Geez, I wish
he'd stop doin' that.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.284
(Dog barks loudly)

22:14.352 --> 22:16.420
Hey, you don't have to lay
on the horn every time.

22:16.487 --> 22:17.721
Lanny:
I got your cheque.

22:17.789 --> 22:18.922
Tim: Of course it does
get my attention.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.390
Lanny:
For Dexter.

22:20.458 --> 22:21.991
Thank you.

22:22.059 --> 22:23.727
I tell ya,
I can't wait to see you

22:23.795 --> 22:25.060
get on that horse.

22:25.128 --> 22:25.961
You're gonna look like
the queen of the rodeo.

22:26.029 --> 22:27.830
(Giggles)

22:27.897 --> 22:29.365
But we gotta get
a move on.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.900
So you got any decent ranches
lined up for us today?

22:31.968 --> 22:34.036
Tim:
Yeah. Got a couple of beauties.

22:34.103 --> 22:34.903
<i>Lanny:</i>
<i>That's what you said yesrterday.</i>

22:34.971 --> 22:36.071
Tim:
Wish us luck.

22:37.006 --> 22:38.341
Amy:
Good luck.

22:40.210 --> 22:42.143
You haven't told him
about Dexter have you?

22:42.211 --> 22:45.447
I told you,
I'll deal with it later.

22:45.514 --> 22:46.514
Okay.

22:48.884 --> 22:50.885
Amy: All right, you look good.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.487
Okay, I want you
to keep your shoulders,

22:52.555 --> 22:54.255
<i>your hips and your heels</i>
<i>all in line.</i>

22:54.323 --> 22:55.724
Okay.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.123
Amy: You don't have
to be scared, okay?

22:57.191 --> 22:59.059
Klondike is a real sweetheart.
I just took him on.

22:59.126 --> 23:00.126
Okay.
(Chuckles)

23:00.194 --> 23:01.528
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

23:01.596 --> 23:03.997
I want you to put some pressure
in your stirrups,

23:04.065 --> 23:06.032
and when you're ready
you just squeeze him forward.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.469
Paige:
Okay. (Clicks teeth)

23:08.536 --> 23:09.403
Whoa! What's he doing?
Where's he going?!

23:09.471 --> 23:10.637
Amy:
It's okay.

23:10.705 --> 23:11.405
Just drop your hands,
drop your hands.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.705
Paige:
Ah! Okay.

23:12.773 --> 23:14.106
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>All right,</i>

23:14.174 --> 23:15.274
<i>you're just giving him</i>
<i>the wrong signal.</i>

23:15.342 --> 23:17.910
So, why don't we try
something else?

23:17.978 --> 23:19.979
Okay, I want you to grab tight
onto your horn.

23:20.046 --> 23:21.514
Paige: Okay, I don't
know much about horses,

23:21.582 --> 23:22.815
but I do know
that's a dead giveaway

23:22.883 --> 23:24.384
that somebody can't ride.

23:24.451 --> 23:26.252
Amy: Okay, well, these
things, they do take time.

23:26.319 --> 23:27.787
Paige:
But I don't have time.

23:27.855 --> 23:28.920
Lanny wants to see me ride,

23:28.988 --> 23:33.057
so can we step up
the training?

23:33.125 --> 23:34.893
Amy: (Cell phone rings) Okay.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.329
(Phone beeps on)
Just give me two minutes.

23:39.331 --> 23:40.665
(Sighs)
Hey, Ty.

23:42.001 --> 23:44.269
Whoa! Slow down,
slow down.

23:45.737 --> 23:47.071
You were fired?

23:49.975 --> 23:52.443
Jack:
Hey, look who's here.

23:52.511 --> 23:54.012
Hi!
Hi!

23:54.079 --> 23:55.613
Lisa: How are you?
Mallory: Good.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.614
Lisa:
Wow! You look great!

23:56.681 --> 23:58.049
Mallory:
Oh, thanks!

23:58.117 --> 24:00.051
It smells good in here.
Did Lou cook muffins?

24:00.119 --> 24:02.252
No, I baked croissants.

24:03.154 --> 24:06.523
Jack: Lisa's spoilin' me
with a picnic lunch today.

24:06.590 --> 24:08.758
We are going to eat
all our favourite foods

24:08.826 --> 24:10.093
from our time
in France.

24:10.161 --> 24:11.361
Wow! Look at you
all cultured.

24:11.429 --> 24:13.130
(Telephone rings)

24:13.731 --> 24:15.432
<i>Lisa:</i> <i>I'm kind of proud of them.</i>
<i>Look at them.</i>

24:15.499 --> 24:17.333
Hello?

24:17.401 --> 24:19.902
Yes, it is.

24:19.970 --> 24:22.138
Oh boy.

24:22.205 --> 24:24.974
I certainly will.
Thank you.

24:25.042 --> 24:26.142
(Phone beeps off)

24:26.209 --> 24:27.509
Let me guess:
Georgie.

24:27.577 --> 24:30.179
Yeah, she got into a dust up
at recess there

24:30.247 --> 24:33.848
and now she's been
suspended.

24:33.916 --> 24:35.450
Lise...

24:35.517 --> 24:38.286
I, uh...
I have to go.

24:43.025 --> 24:46.261
This is getting ridiculous.
Who is Georgie?

24:46.329 --> 24:49.129
This really is
getting ridiculous.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.832
No, seriously,
who is Georgie?

24:51.899 --> 24:53.600
Amy: I still think we're
going a little fast.

24:53.668 --> 24:55.369
I mean, wouldn't it
just be easier

24:55.437 --> 24:56.837
for you to tell Lanny?

24:56.904 --> 24:59.106
No. You don't know him
like I do.

24:59.174 --> 25:02.042
<i>I've been with him for 3 years,</i>
<i>i've worked with him for 5.</i>

25:02.110 --> 25:03.444
You work for him?

25:03.511 --> 25:07.480
Yeah, that's how we met.
I'm his VP of marketing.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.415
Oh, sorry, I just-
I didn't think-

25:09.483 --> 25:10.816
Yeah, most people don't.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.953
They assume I'm just some
gold-digging trophy wife.

25:14.021 --> 25:17.556
Let's just get on with this...
lesson, okay?

25:17.624 --> 25:19.158
Okay.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.559
Pretty simple -

25:20.627 --> 25:21.860
I just want you to go
to the right of this pole

25:21.927 --> 25:23.895
and weave your way
right to the end, okay?

25:23.963 --> 25:25.663
Okay.

25:25.731 --> 25:27.832
Amy: You can just go at a walk,
a trot, whatever you feel.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.634

<i>Amy:</i> <i>That's good!</i>
<i>Look where you want to go,</i>

25:31.104 --> 25:33.005

It's okay.

25:40.778 --> 25:41.879
Paige: That's it!
I can't do this!

25:41.946 --> 25:43.214
Okay, just stay calm, okay?

<i>Hey, look who's here!</i>

Yay!

25:52.557 --> 25:53.689
Whoa!
What's with you?

25:53.757 --> 25:55.892
Nothing! Just no one cares
that I'm back.

25:55.959 --> 25:58.528
Lou: I do. Hello?
Why do you think I texted you?

25:58.595 --> 26:00.596
Really? I thought it's 'cause
you needed a babysitter.

26:00.664 --> 26:02.732
What?! No!
That is not...

26:03.700 --> 26:05.068
The only reason.

26:05.136 --> 26:06.069
I knew it.

26:06.137 --> 26:07.303
(Sighs)

26:07.371 --> 26:08.371
Please, Mallory,
just for an hour, okay?

26:08.439 --> 26:10.605
I've gotta look
at this guy's portfolio.

26:10.673 --> 26:11.773
He's a heavy hitter

26:11.841 --> 26:13.075
and I could really use
the business.

26:13.143 --> 26:14.510
Fine!
Under one condition:

26:14.577 --> 26:16.578
Just tell me what's up
with this Georgie kid.

26:16.646 --> 26:17.879
Yes, absolutely.

26:17.947 --> 26:20.782

later, okay?

26:37.832 --> 26:39.633
Hey, Scott,
how's it going?

26:39.701 --> 26:41.201
Can't complain.

26:41.735 --> 26:44.871

26:47.208 --> 26:50.177
inconvenience,
and hassle won't fix.

26:50.244 --> 26:51.778
Scott:
Hey, I was looking for you.

26:51.845 --> 26:52.979
I was just wondering
how those new horses

26:53.047 --> 26:54.814
from the McSlade ranch
were doing.

26:54.882 --> 26:56.550
Really.

26:56.617 --> 26:59.652
Um... is this a bad time?

26:59.720 --> 27:01.888
Amy:
Well, it's kind of awkward.

27:01.956 --> 27:03.756
What do you mean?

27:03.824 --> 27:06.258
You just fired
my boyfriend.

27:06.326 --> 27:08.061
You fired Ty?

27:08.128 --> 27:11.464
(Shocked)
This is news to me.

27:11.531 --> 27:14.600
Really?
Ty thinks you let him go.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.469
What's up with
that guy lately?

27:17.536 --> 27:20.606
Well, he's, you know,
he's stressed about exams

27:20.673 --> 27:21.673
and studying and...

27:23.109 --> 27:23.909
<i>You should probably</i>
<i>let him know</i>

27:23.977 --> 27:26.078
<i>he still has his job.</i>

27:30.148 --> 27:31.348
Actually, Scott,

27:31.416 --> 27:34.384
I think I know what's weighing
on Ty's mind.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.386
He proposed to Amy

27:36.454 --> 27:37.822
and he didn't exactly
get the response

27:37.889 --> 27:39.356
he was looking for.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.862
Mallory:
Jake!

27:50.901 --> 27:52.535
I was surprised
to hear from you.

27:52.603 --> 27:54.838
Yeah, I just got back.

27:55.773 --> 27:58.574
No phones in Nashville?

27:58.643 --> 28:00.543
Look, I'm sorry.

28:00.611 --> 28:02.478
You don't owe me
an explanation.

28:02.546 --> 28:03.846
Jake,
don't be like that.

28:03.913 --> 28:06.282
I'm back
and it's for good now.

28:06.350 --> 28:08.217
I'm happy for you.

28:09.186 --> 28:10.486
Look...

28:10.554 --> 28:13.088
I've got a ton of homework
to do, so...

28:13.157 --> 28:14.923
I'll see later.

28:26.202 --> 28:27.435
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

28:27.503 --> 28:28.537
Jack:
Hi!

28:30.406 --> 28:32.507
I'm sorry for leaving you.

28:32.575 --> 28:33.875
Lisa:
Again.

28:33.942 --> 28:35.342
Jack:
I know.

28:35.410 --> 28:38.912
I just need to get this
situation under control.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.781
What if you can't
do that?

28:40.848 --> 28:42.849
What do you mean
"can't"?

28:42.917 --> 28:44.318
Well, I mean...

28:44.386 --> 28:45.653
What if it's too much
for you?

28:45.720 --> 28:46.720
You know,
raising an 11-year-old,

28:46.788 --> 28:48.088
that's a lot of work.

28:48.156 --> 28:49.657
For someone my age?

28:49.724 --> 28:50.890
No, Jack,

28:50.957 --> 28:52.958
it's more about where you are
in your life!

28:53.026 --> 28:54.227
You raised a child.

28:54.295 --> 28:55.562
You practically raised
your grandchildren!

28:55.629 --> 28:57.297
I mean, why are you
always the one

28:57.364 --> 28:59.165
that has to jump
to the rescue?

28:59.233 --> 29:00.466
Haven't you cleaned up
enough people's messes

29:00.534 --> 29:02.168
- at this point?
- Oh, so what,

29:02.236 --> 29:04.170
I should just turn
my back on her?

29:04.238 --> 29:07.606
Georgie:
Sorry to cause such a mess.

29:07.674 --> 29:10.442
Jack:
That's not what Lisa meant.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.511
She just wants me
to think through

29:12.579 --> 29:14.813
what's best for all of us.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.948
You mean what's best for her.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.851
Okay.

29:19.919 --> 29:22.087
I'm gonna leave this
to you, okay?

29:22.154 --> 29:23.387
Jack:
I'm sorry.

29:23.455 --> 29:25.223
Lisa: Mmm-hmm.
You call me sometime.

29:28.827 --> 29:30.794
That is not fair.

29:30.862 --> 29:33.631
She's put up with a lot
since she got back,

29:33.699 --> 29:35.099
and you know what?
Maybe she's right.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.401
Maybe I am too old
to take care of a girl like you.

29:37.469 --> 29:38.668
A girl like me?

29:38.736 --> 29:41.104
That's right;
A girl that skips school

29:41.171 --> 29:42.772
and gets suspended
for fighting.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.207
Well, that's your fault.

29:44.275 --> 29:45.642
I beg your pardon?!

29:45.710 --> 29:47.744
You told my teacher
what was going on!

29:47.811 --> 29:49.812
I was gonna tell her myself.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.248
You made me look
like a total wimp!

29:51.315 --> 29:54.483
So what, you had to go punch out
Kyle Suffield?

29:54.551 --> 29:57.052
Yeah.
I hit him hard,

29:57.120 --> 29:59.054
hard as any boy could.

29:59.122 --> 30:01.656
Then he cried...
like a little girl.

30:06.229 --> 30:07.996
Well, okay,

30:08.064 --> 30:11.666
maybe I did jump the gun
with your teacher,

30:12.635 --> 30:15.270
<i>but you better make sure</i>
<i>that I never ever</i>

30:15.337 --> 30:17.438
get another call
like the one I got today.

30:17.506 --> 30:19.039
Do you understand me?

30:21.076 --> 30:22.443
I gotta go do some homework.

30:28.150 --> 30:29.150
(Sighs heavily)

30:31.620 --> 30:32.719
Amy.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.221
Dad, did you find Lanny
a ranch today?

30:35.290 --> 30:37.056
He didn't like
any of them.

30:37.124 --> 30:38.024
I got one more
to show him tomorrow

30:38.092 --> 30:39.626
and that's it.

30:39.694 --> 30:42.195
His standards
are too high.

30:42.263 --> 30:43.397
Of course
I shouldn't complain

30:43.464 --> 30:45.231
because that's why
he bought Dexter.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.900
Amy: Actually, can I
talk to you about that?

30:46.967 --> 30:48.367
Tim: Well, no, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

30:48.435 --> 30:50.102
<i>I plan on giving you a cut.</i>

30:50.170 --> 30:51.304
<i>Amy:</i> <i>No, no, that's not</i>
<i>what I mean.</i>

30:52.606 --> 30:54.106
What the hell
are you trying to pull?

30:54.174 --> 30:55.608
Tim:
What?

30:55.676 --> 30:57.343
How dare you put my wife
on a dangerous horse!

30:57.411 --> 30:58.711
She actually said that?

30:58.779 --> 31:00.212
Oh, she told me
the whole story -

31:00.280 --> 31:02.848
And you can keep that nag
you switched for Dexter!

31:02.916 --> 31:04.049
What're you talkin' about?

31:04.117 --> 31:05.550
This is what I was
trying to tell you.

31:05.618 --> 31:07.419
Dexter isn't right
for Paige, but-

31:07.486 --> 31:08.753
Well, that's a pleasant way
to put it.

31:08.821 --> 31:11.389
He damn near killed her!

31:11.457 --> 31:13.725
I want my money back!

31:17.930 --> 31:19.864
You mind telling me
how I just lost 30 grand?

31:28.082 --> 31:29.315
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

31:33.620 --> 31:34.887
Amy:
I can't believe you told him

31:34.955 --> 31:37.489
we tried to sell you
a dangerous horse!

31:37.557 --> 31:39.023
I couldn't tell him
the truth.

31:39.092 --> 31:40.024
I don't get it.

31:40.093 --> 31:41.393
You can't ride,
so what?

31:41.461 --> 31:44.129
Is he really gonna
hold that against you?

31:44.197 --> 31:46.631
I don't know,
he might.

31:46.699 --> 31:47.832
Why?

31:47.900 --> 31:49.434
It's kind of hard
to understand, okay?

31:49.502 --> 31:51.203
Well, try me.

31:51.270 --> 31:53.304
(Sighs)

31:53.371 --> 31:54.905
Lanny is
a very wealthy man

31:54.973 --> 31:57.040
and so are all
of his friends,

31:57.109 --> 31:58.976
and they all talk like
they've been everywhere

31:59.043 --> 32:01.212
and done everything.

32:01.279 --> 32:02.946
It's intimidating.

32:03.014 --> 32:05.316
You're right,
I don't understand.

32:05.383 --> 32:09.452
So I told Lanny that
I grew up on this big ranch

32:09.520 --> 32:11.121
filled with prize horses.

32:11.188 --> 32:14.491
And you didn't even grow up
in the country, did you?

32:14.558 --> 32:16.792
Actually, I did,

32:16.860 --> 32:19.562
just nowhere
near a ranch.

32:21.465 --> 32:23.433
I grew up in Barnwell,

32:23.501 --> 32:26.801
above my family's
grocery store,

32:26.869 --> 32:28.837
until it went bankrupt.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.143
You must think
I'm such a fraud...

32:38.314 --> 32:40.215
Because that's exactly
what I am.

32:47.055 --> 32:48.422
(Horse whinnies)

32:51.660 --> 32:53.227
Mallory:
What do you think you're doing?

32:53.295 --> 32:54.762
What does it look like
I'm doing?

32:54.829 --> 32:56.297
It looks like
you're wasting your time

32:56.365 --> 32:58.064
because you're not
riding him.

32:58.132 --> 32:59.266
Amy said I could.

32:59.333 --> 33:00.400
Who do you think
you are?!

33:00.468 --> 33:01.834
And what're you
even doing here?!

33:01.902 --> 33:04.070
No one else seems
to have time to tell me.

33:04.138 --> 33:06.806
Look, I just wanna go
for a ride, okay?

33:06.874 --> 33:08.908
Well, you can't.
He's my horse.

33:08.976 --> 33:10.544
You should thank me
for riding Copper.

33:10.611 --> 33:12.212
He's way out of shape.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.513
That's why I'm taking him
for a ride!

33:14.581 --> 33:17.849
Fine!
He's a boring horse anyway!

33:21.154 --> 33:22.054
Who's the kid?!

33:22.121 --> 33:23.522
Okay, look,

33:23.590 --> 33:25.191
I will tell you all about
this Georgie thing,

33:25.258 --> 33:27.859
but only if you promise
to come by tonight around 6:00.

33:27.927 --> 33:29.228
You need me
to babysit again.

33:29.296 --> 33:31.296
Just promise me
you'll be here.

33:31.363 --> 33:32.397
Fine, whatever.

33:32.464 --> 33:34.399
Just explain to me
who the kid is.

33:39.338 --> 33:40.839
(Dogs bark in kennel)

33:42.208 --> 33:45.776
You seriously thought
I would replace you?

33:46.745 --> 33:49.546
There was this new girl here,
Scott, and...

33:49.614 --> 33:51.682
Come on, man!
If I was gonna fire you,

33:51.750 --> 33:54.085
I'd at least do it
to your face.

33:54.152 --> 33:55.385
I know, man.

33:55.453 --> 33:56.587
I just thought
with these mistakes

33:56.654 --> 33:58.322
that I've been making recently that-

33:58.389 --> 34:00.457
Hey, at least you didn't
mix up the dogs' files

34:00.525 --> 34:02.759
until after the cremation.

34:02.827 --> 34:04.160
(Chuckles)

34:05.096 --> 34:07.363
So who is this
Cassandra girl anyway?

34:07.431 --> 34:09.665
She's a vet student
at the U of C.

34:09.734 --> 34:11.034
Things are pickin' up
around here

34:11.101 --> 34:13.870
so I thought we could use
the extra pair of hands,

34:13.938 --> 34:16.505
and now you'll know someone
when you get in.

34:16.572 --> 34:18.040
Oh, if I get in.

34:19.007 --> 34:19.942
It seems like
a pretty big "if"

34:20.009 --> 34:21.409
at the moment.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.813
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

34:24.880 --> 34:25.813
Sure.

34:25.882 --> 34:27.815
You need to stop
obsessing.

34:27.884 --> 34:30.085
Scott, my finals are in
a couple of weeks.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.553
If I'm gonna get
into vet school,

34:31.621 --> 34:32.788
this is exactly when
I have to start obsessing.

34:34.356 --> 34:36.389
(Sighs) I'm not talkin'
about school.

34:41.630 --> 34:44.364
Well, I don't really wanna
talk about that, so...

34:44.431 --> 34:46.500
Okay, I understand.

34:47.601 --> 34:48.668
Thank you.

34:51.472 --> 34:52.572
(Birds chirp)

34:53.741 --> 34:56.609
Then what is it,
sweetheart?

34:58.846 --> 35:02.715
I haven't been entirely
honest with you.

35:06.086 --> 35:07.019
Come on,
how bad can it be?

35:07.087 --> 35:08.520
Just tell me.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.891
If it's okay,
I think I'd rather show you.

35:19.565 --> 35:20.599
<i>Amy:</i> <i>How are you feeling?</i> <i>Good?</i>

35:20.667 --> 35:22.100
<i>Paige:</i>
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

35:22.168 --> 35:23.668
Amy: All right, I want
you to take one hand

35:23.735 --> 35:25.670
and put it on your saddle horn -

35:25.737 --> 35:27.172
hang on tight,
okay -

35:27.239 --> 35:28.606
and when you're ready,

35:28.674 --> 35:29.774
I just want you
to squeeze your legs

35:29.842 --> 35:30.842
and click to him.

35:30.910 --> 35:32.110
Feel secure?

35:32.178 --> 35:33.278
Yeah, I think so.

35:34.146 --> 35:36.547
Amy:
Okay, go ahead and cluck.

35:36.615 --> 35:38.381
Paige:
(Clucks teeth)

35:45.155 --> 35:47.357
So I take it Dexter
wasn't the problem?

35:47.425 --> 35:50.092
No, but he wasn't
the right horse for her either.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.528
And you've been
giving her lessons?

35:58.202 --> 35:59.235
(Clicks teeth)

36:01.304 --> 36:03.806
Look at you!
Queen of the rodeo!

36:04.741 --> 36:05.874
(Chuckles)

36:14.022 --> 36:15.255
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

36:15.323 --> 36:17.024
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

36:17.091 --> 36:18.591
I, uh, spoke to Lanny.

36:19.527 --> 36:21.961
Turns out the last place
that I showed him on my list

36:22.029 --> 36:22.995
he loved!

36:23.063 --> 36:23.930
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

36:23.997 --> 36:25.898
Yeah, he still hates me,

36:25.966 --> 36:28.100
but he's gonna honour
my finder's fee.

36:28.168 --> 36:30.002
Hmm.

36:30.070 --> 36:31.938
So I guess I owe Amy
an apology.

36:32.005 --> 36:33.405
How big of you.

36:33.473 --> 36:36.809
Yeah, I wasn't too optimistic
about that one.

36:36.877 --> 36:39.478
It's got a state-of-the-art
cattle facility.

36:39.546 --> 36:42.314
It's got a big house,
a big view, but...

36:42.382 --> 36:44.650
But?

36:44.718 --> 36:46.484
<i>Tim:</i> <i>But I just don't see</i>
<i>how he's gonna make any money off of it</i>

36:46.920 --> 36:48.687
There's not enough land
to make an income.

36:48.755 --> 36:50.188
You can't feed
a decent sized herd.

36:50.256 --> 36:52.758
Well, don't you think
you should tell him that?

36:52.826 --> 36:53.859
He loves it.

36:55.427 --> 36:56.594
He just wanted a place
to show off

36:56.662 --> 36:59.296
to his rich friends
in the city.

37:08.357 --> 37:09.924
I think I can do better.

37:09.992 --> 37:11.825
You've looked
at our financials?

37:11.892 --> 37:15.329
Lou: Yes, and I don't agree with
your advisors' investment plan.

37:15.396 --> 37:16.497
See, honey,

37:16.564 --> 37:17.664
they're being
too conservative.

37:17.732 --> 37:19.600
No, it's the opposite.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.901
I don't think
they can stand up to you.

37:21.969 --> 37:23.504
<i>Look, they obviously know</i>
<i>you have this</i>

37:23.571 --> 37:25.205
<i>"go big or go home" attitude</i>

37:25.273 --> 37:28.073
and it's clouding
their judgment.

37:28.142 --> 37:29.142
Mr. Barrick,
you need someone who can

37:29.209 --> 37:30.976
save you from yourself.

37:31.044 --> 37:32.512
Is this how you court
someone's business,

37:32.579 --> 37:33.679
by insulting them?

37:33.747 --> 37:35.281
Come on, Lanny,
let's hear her out.

37:35.349 --> 37:36.482
So give us an example.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.551
Well, there's the ranch.

37:38.619 --> 37:40.253
Um, you know what?
That's not-

37:40.320 --> 37:41.554
actually, let's talk
about your stocks.

37:41.622 --> 37:44.088
No, no, no wait.
Go back to the ranch.

37:44.157 --> 37:45.223
It's not a good example.

37:45.291 --> 37:47.659
But you brought it up.

37:49.061 --> 37:50.895
It sounds like
a nice weekend getaway,

37:50.963 --> 37:52.964
but it's a poor investment.

37:53.032 --> 37:54.366
Your father
recommended it.

37:54.433 --> 37:55.433
Well, yes,

37:55.501 --> 37:56.568
but you didn't take him
with you,

37:56.636 --> 37:57.769
and if you had
he would've noticed

37:57.836 --> 37:59.336
there isn't much land.

37:59.404 --> 38:02.706
More land equals more cattle,
which equals more money.

38:02.774 --> 38:04.708
Just like the first ranch
that we saw.

38:04.776 --> 38:06.810
Paige, do you want to live
in that decrepit old house?

38:06.878 --> 38:08.479
Knock it down.

38:08.547 --> 38:09.980
Build yourselves a new one
exactly the way you want it.

38:11.416 --> 38:12.949
So you're saying

38:13.017 --> 38:15.017
we could actually make money
out of this hobby.

38:17.988 --> 38:18.988
Hmm.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.527
Ty:
Nice, nice!

38:24.595 --> 38:26.062
Lou: You guys, I think I hear her!
Shh! Shh!

38:26.129 --> 38:27.129
Ty:
Oh, hide, hide, hide, hide!

38:32.502 --> 38:33.735
All: (Shouts) Surprise!

38:33.803 --> 38:34.736
Lou:
Dad!

38:34.804 --> 38:36.205
Tim:
What?!

38:36.272 --> 38:38.240
Jack: We're doing a
thing for Mallory here.

38:38.308 --> 38:39.675
Tim:
Oh.

38:39.742 --> 38:41.843
Jack:
What is your problem?

38:41.911 --> 38:43.445
Tim: My meddling
daughters is my problem.

38:43.513 --> 38:45.347
First Amy blew up
my deal with Dexter,

38:45.415 --> 38:46.614
<i>and then you</i>

38:46.682 --> 38:48.216
had to open your mouth
about the ranch!

38:48.283 --> 38:49.950
He decided not to buy it?

38:50.018 --> 38:52.220
He decided to buy the first one
that he looked at,

38:52.287 --> 38:54.655
which is the only one
I don't get a finder's fee on!

38:54.723 --> 38:56.557
He asked for
my professional opinion, Dad.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.891
Uh, uh, guys!

38:57.959 --> 38:59.126
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>What did you want me to do?</i>

38:59.194 --> 39:00.595
Tim: You sold me
out for a client?

39:00.662 --> 39:01.729
Lou: That is not fair!
That is not how it happened!

39:01.796 --> 39:02.696
Ty:
Guys, hold on a second, okay?

39:02.763 --> 39:03.396
Amy:
(Whistles shrilly)

39:03.464 --> 39:04.531
Tim:
I did...

39:04.599 --> 39:05.532
All: (Half-hearted) Surprise!

39:05.600 --> 39:07.767
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

39:07.835 --> 39:09.336
Welcome home.

39:09.403 --> 39:10.704
Good to be home.

39:11.672 --> 39:13.240
Come here.
(Horn blasts outside)

39:13.307 --> 39:15.007
Tim:
Hey, I know that horn.

39:18.445 --> 39:19.945
Lanny:
Hey.

39:20.012 --> 39:21.213
Thought I'd stop by

39:21.281 --> 39:22.180
before we headed back
to the city.

39:22.249 --> 39:23.649
Amy:
Where's Paige?

39:23.717 --> 39:24.950
Lanny: She's off saying
good-bye to Klondike.

39:25.017 --> 39:25.884
Amy:
Okay, we'll see ya.

39:25.952 --> 39:27.119
Lanny:
All right.

39:28.054 --> 39:30.556
You really impressed me,
Lou.

39:30.624 --> 39:31.757
I'd like to see
what you can do

39:31.824 --> 39:33.091
with a portion
of our portfolio.

39:33.159 --> 39:34.226
The better you do,

39:34.293 --> 39:35.860
the more
I'll let you manage.

39:35.927 --> 39:38.563
Thank you.
I won't let you down.

39:39.698 --> 39:41.332
And I do appreciate
all the legwork you did

39:41.400 --> 39:42.533
to find us a ranch.

39:42.601 --> 39:44.636
Well, I'm just glad
you found a place.

39:44.703 --> 39:47.972
And sorry about that
little mix-up with Dexter.

39:48.039 --> 39:51.541
If it's any consolation,
we'd like to buy Klondike.

39:51.609 --> 39:53.109
Except he's not my horse.

39:53.177 --> 39:56.680
You're gonna have to talk
to Amy about that.

39:56.748 --> 39:58.047
You know,
when I first met you,

39:58.115 --> 40:00.083
I thought you were out to take advantage
of a weekend cowboy.

40:01.151 --> 40:04.254
But I can see now
you're a stand-up guy.

40:04.322 --> 40:07.122
You've earned something more
important than my money, Tim.

40:07.190 --> 40:09.825
You've gained my respect.

40:17.501 --> 40:19.902
<i>Paige:</i>
<i>You're such a good boy!</i>

40:19.969 --> 40:22.070
We'll be back real soon,
Klondike,

40:22.138 --> 40:24.472
and I can't wait
to see you again!

40:24.540 --> 40:25.774
I think he likes you.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:27.276 --> 40:30.645
(Laughs)
I think we make a good match.

40:30.713 --> 40:31.746
Bye.

40:33.449 --> 40:35.116
So we'll be in touch.

40:35.184 --> 40:36.651
Yeah.

40:36.719 --> 40:38.919
Oh, um, by the way,

40:39.921 --> 40:41.355
I told Lanny everything.

40:41.423 --> 40:43.390
And?

40:43.458 --> 40:46.960
He said that's why I've risen
to VP of marketing so quickly.

40:47.028 --> 40:50.964
I always do what I gotta do
to land a deal.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.599
- Bye.
- See ya.

40:58.806 --> 41:01.073
Mallory:
Thanks for meeting me again.

41:01.141 --> 41:03.509
I do owe you an explanation.

41:08.449 --> 41:12.016
I was miserable
in Nashville, okay?

41:12.084 --> 41:13.852
And I was afraid

41:13.919 --> 41:15.821
if I heard your voice
on the phone

41:15.888 --> 41:17.556
I'd miss home even more.

41:17.623 --> 41:19.290
Really?

41:19.359 --> 41:22.494
I swear.
I did miss you, a lot.

41:27.298 --> 41:29.299
So, new car, huh?

41:32.170 --> 41:34.104
It's pretty cool.

41:34.172 --> 41:37.174
Come on,
let's go for a ride.

41:39.578 --> 41:41.579
Lisa: You should have
told me about Georgie.

41:41.646 --> 41:42.712
I know.

41:43.981 --> 41:45.782
And I don't think
you're too old.

41:45.850 --> 41:47.049
(Chuckles)

41:48.018 --> 41:49.585
Seriously, I don't.

41:49.652 --> 41:52.421
I think if anybody can keep up
with that kid, you can.

41:52.489 --> 41:53.822
(Snorts softly)

41:54.657 --> 41:58.861
You have more energy
than a man half your age.

41:58.928 --> 42:00.295
I don't know how you do it.

42:00.363 --> 42:02.063
I was thinking about
our first day in Paris

42:02.131 --> 42:05.332
and walking all over the city
on foot.

42:06.635 --> 42:08.068
You were amazing.

42:09.271 --> 42:11.171
(Snores)

42:16.978 --> 42:20.647
You sure you're all right
to take a night off studying?

42:20.715 --> 42:21.782
Yeah.

42:23.183 --> 42:26.185
Those exams
are driving me crazy.

42:26.253 --> 42:27.487
Amy:
You keep saying that,

42:27.555 --> 42:29.088
but I think we both know
that's not it.

42:35.596 --> 42:36.729
<i>Ty.</i>

42:36.797 --> 42:38.864
Come on,
we should talk about this.

42:38.932 --> 42:39.998
Ty:
No.

42:43.069 --> 42:45.170
I just need to let it go...

42:47.941 --> 42:49.942
Because I love you, Amy.

42:51.377 --> 42:54.078
We agreed that
we were gonna wait,

42:54.146 --> 42:57.982
so it'll happen
when it's supposed to happen.

42:59.151 --> 43:00.518
I know it will.

43:05.724 --> 43:08.692
Come on,
let's go for a ride.

43:10.495 --> 43:11.562
Amy:
Where?

43:13.531 --> 43:14.798
I don't know.

43:15.834 --> 43:17.468
How about back
