-Hi, Abby.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.112
Abby, you want to say hi
to the nice people? Say, "Hi."

12:18.195 --> 12:19.071
[man] Okay.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.657
-[woman] She's focused.
-[Annie laughs] She's focused on her ham.

12:21.740 --> 12:25.327
-[babbles]
-[imitating car noises]

12:28.956 --> 12:30.416
Ooh. Ooh.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.420
-Ooh!
-Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.088
How does it go again?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.340
[both squealing]

12:40.843 --> 12:44.346
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where my friends are?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.974
-Where are my friends?
-[giggles]

12:47.057 --> 12:48.976
Where did all my friends go?

12:49.059 --> 12:52.021
Let's get your back.
Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, good.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.816
-Oh! [squeals]
-[laughs]

12:56.567 --> 12:59.236
[Annie babbling]

12:59.320 --> 13:00.988
[both laugh]

13:01.071 --> 13:03.282
Close your eyes.
There you go.

13:03.365 --> 13:08.829
-Yeah, yeah. Good job. Good job.
-[both chuckle]

13:16.170 --> 13:19.215
-[Annie] Hey.
-[Samantha]  Hey, Annie. How's it going?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.759
Oh, it's going okay. Um--

13:21.842 --> 13:23.552
Good. How's Abby?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.971
She's great. She's just the sweetest.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.767
She's a good kid.
I'm having a really good time with her.

13:29.850 --> 13:30.726
How are you doing?

13:31.435 --> 13:34.063
I'm not great.

13:34.146 --> 13:39.276
I wanted to ask you
if I could push my flight by a day?

13:39.360 --> 13:43.864
Um... is there any chance
you would be able to watch her

13:43.948 --> 13:47.576
-tomorrow and tomorrow night?
-Oh, um. Hmm.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.871
Listen, if it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.748
I know you already changed
your schedule for me.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.751
No, I'm pretty sure I can make it work.
Is it just one more day?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.253
Yeah, just like, um--

13:57.336 --> 14:00.005
I'll get on that same flight
the day after tomorrow.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.591
So it would be in the afternoon.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.510
It will be all day tomorrow
and tomorrow night.

14:04.593 --> 14:08.973
-Okay. Yeah, I'll make it work.
-You sure?

14:09.056 --> 14:14.228
I'm having a really great time with her.
She's so much fun, so I--

14:14.311 --> 14:19.483
Worry about what you have to do there
and I'll see you the next day.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.484
It's not a big deal.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.696
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.824
Honestly, I wouldn't be
getting through this without you.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.534
So, thank you. I really appreciate it.

14:28.617 --> 14:32.037
Oh, it's no problem,
and I hope things get better over there.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.749
Thanks. Give Abby a hug for me.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.793
All right, sounds good.
Have a good night.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.879
-All right, get some rest.
-Bye.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.922
-Bye.
-[call disconnects]

14:47.928 --> 14:49.555
[Annie]  Hey, it's me.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.683
I know I was supposed to come over tonight
to pick up my stuff,

14:52.766 --> 14:57.771
but I ended up
having to help out a friend, so, um...

14:57.855 --> 15:00.316
maybe I can do it tomorrow or something.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.570
I'll try you then. Okay.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.574
All right, I hope you're doing well.
All right. Bye.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.619
She's now in the lead.
Can you believe it?

15:11.702 --> 15:13.871
She's got one more turn to go, folks.
Can she make it?

15:13.954 --> 15:16.457
Can she win the race?
Oh, here she goes!

15:16.540 --> 15:18.208
And she won!

15:18.292 --> 15:21.378
-[babbles]
-[Abby laughing]

15:21.462 --> 15:23.714
Look out, Abby. Look out, Abby.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.883
Abby, how did it feel to win the race?

15:26.508 --> 15:27.843
[babbles]

15:27.927 --> 15:29.845
Yes, you won the race.
Did it feel great?

15:30.554 --> 15:31.513
[Annie grunts]

15:31.597 --> 15:36.310
Some dinner.
And we'll get you avocado.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.436
You want a green apple?

15:38.854 --> 15:41.690
Or I will trade you that for that.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.485
-Hi. Can I please get two bratwurst
-Hi. What can I get for you?

15:44.568 --> 15:46.612
and a half pound of the snack sausage?

15:46.695 --> 15:48.447
Two bratwursts,
half a pound of snack sausage.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.823
Anything else for you?

15:49.907 --> 15:52.159
-That's it. Thanks.
-All right. You got it.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.918
You want me to get your bib? Here.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.962
You don't like it?

16:07.174 --> 16:08.509
There. How's that?

16:08.592 --> 16:10.219
-Good.
-[chuckles] Good?

16:19.478 --> 16:21.814
-[Annie] A pigg y?
- Yeah.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.774
-What can this--
-Blue.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.901
Blue. That is blue. You're right. Whoa.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.363
And yellow.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.865
-Yellow?
-Yeah.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.452
[chuckles]

16:54.430 --> 16:55.556
Thank you.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.519
Look who it is. Yeah.

17:00.602 --> 17:03.772
Can you wave to Mommy?
Say, "Hi, Mom."

17:06.358 --> 17:07.568
There's Mommy.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.778
Hi.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.196
Mama.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.115
Hi, guys.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.283
Hey, welcome back.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.910
Thank you. Hi, baby.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.370
-There's Mama.
-[chuckles]

17:18.454 --> 17:20.706
Hi. Aw.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.250
Hi, sweet girl. [kisses]

17:23.333 --> 17:25.377
-[chuckles]
-Oh, was today okay?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.754
-[Annie] Yeah, she was--
-Show me your chair.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.797
-She was awesome. We played and--
-Show me your chair.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.258
-[Annie chuckles]
-[Abby] Lion.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.885
-[Samantha] Oh, your lion.
-[Annie] And your lion.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.928
[Annie] You want to hop on the lion again?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.514
-[Abby babbles]
-Oh, you want Mommy.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.515
-Thank you for...
-You're welcome.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.559
-I'm glad you're back.
-the extra day and everything.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.854
Yeah. It was really actually no problem.
We had such a good time.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.814
Abby, did we have fun?

17:45.898 --> 17:49.401
How did everything go
with your husband?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.737
-You want me on the lion?
-[Annie chuckles]

17:51.820 --> 17:55.324
He's in pretty bad shape.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.826
His parents are gonna take care of him
and, um--

17:58.410 --> 18:02.164
Yeah, I just don't think
he's gonna come back up here.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.666
-Um...
-[babbling]

18:04.750 --> 18:08.629
His parents gotta take care of him
'cause I have to take care of her and--

18:08.712 --> 18:10.839
-Yeah.
-I just, um--

18:11.799 --> 18:14.134
I don't know.
It's just super complicated

18:14.218 --> 18:18.931
and just, like, really not
where I thought I would be right now.

18:19.014 --> 18:22.351
Well, if you need anything, you know,
let me know.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.854
-[chuckles and mumbles]
-Okay. Guess I'm gonna get going.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.107
-Oh, thank you so much.
-Yeah, no.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.109
Honestly, you saved me.

18:30.192 --> 18:34.029
I'm glad you're back.
Bye, Abby. I had so much fun.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.824
-Aw.
-Say bye to Annie. Say bye-bye.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.244
Bye. I'll see you next time.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.620
Yeah, thank you, Annie.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.372
-No problem.
-Have a good night.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.957
[Annie] Thanks, you too. Bye.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.626
-[Samantha] Can you say "bye-bye"?
-[Abby] Bye-bye.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.128
You say "bye-bye"?

18:50.254 --> 18:52.339
-You want to see her in the window?
-Yeah.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.925
-Yeah. Should we go look?
-[babbles]

19:06.436 --> 19:07.729
[sighs]

19:11.358 --> 19:13.944
[Abby] Hey! Hey!

19:14.027 --> 19:16.572
-[chuckles]
-[Abby] Hey!

19:17.698 --> 19:19.408
Bye-bye.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.578
Abby, Mama's got to run outside
for a second, okay, baby?

19:37.134 --> 19:38.969
-Hey.
-Oh.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.264
-Hey.
-Sorry.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.849
What's wrong? What's happening?

19:43.932 --> 19:46.894
No, I'm just not-- [sniffles] Nothing.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.188
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.691
It's just really hard to say bye to Abby.
[sniffles]

19:52.774 --> 19:56.236
We had such a good couple days, you know.
I'm sorry. [chuckles]

19:56.320 --> 19:57.404
That's so sweet.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.450
No, she's so sweet.
She's just-- She's the best.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.784
Are you sure you're okay?

20:03.493 --> 20:08.916
Yeah. I just--
I have a lot of my own stuff.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.752
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.672
Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't even ask
how you were doing.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.883
Oh, no. [chuckles] It's okay.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.177
We're just about to have dinner.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.513
I mean, do you wanna come back in
and have dinner with us?

20:24.139 --> 20:27.059
[stutters] Oh, I wouldn't want to impose.
You just got home.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.727
No, please.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.146
-Really?
-Yeah. Abby would be so psyched.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.233
[chuckles] Yeah, okay. I would like that.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.442
I'm gonna run back in.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.528
-Okay. I'll be a minute.
-See you in a second.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.446
Okay.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.325
[sighs]

20:43.408 --> 20:45.077
-[Samantha] Look at the  agua.
-[Annie chuckles]

20:45.160 --> 20:46.495
[Samantha] She loves this.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.164
I missed you, pumpkin.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.415
Should we fill up the cup?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.000
Why don't we clean these bowls

20:52.084 --> 20:54.253
and then Mama
can set the table for dinner, okay?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.754
Do you want oregano
on the chicken?

20:55.837 --> 20:57.506
-[Samantha] Um, that sounds great.
-Great.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.883
Let me wash my hands of the chicken.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.719
Just gonna borrow some water,
if that's okay.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.722
We might have to share this knife.
Is that okay?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.517
[Annie chuckles] That's okay.
I'll wash some more. No problem.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.980
Oh, wow. This looks good.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.273
[Samantha] Oh, it smells good.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.233
I feel so bad about leaving her.
Thank you so much.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.944
Honestly, it was-- [chuckles]

21:19.027 --> 21:21.363
It was the best time.
I had so much fun.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.699
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. No. I had--

21:23.782 --> 21:27.327
[stammers] I had-- Yeah.
I don't wanna leave. It's great.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.372
She's the best.
She's like my pal. [chuckles]

21:30.455 --> 21:33.208
-[chuckles softly]
-[babbles]

21:33.292 --> 21:36.461
Is Annie your pal?
Is Annie your pal?

21:36.545 --> 21:37.921
[Annie] Have you been able to unpack yet?

21:38.005 --> 21:42.175
I can take care of her for the next hour
if you need time to, like--

21:42.259 --> 21:43.885
I can give Abby a bath?

21:43.969 --> 21:46.471
I feel so bad.
I'm taking up all of your time.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.472
No, seriously.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.766
I don't mind at all.
That way you can settle in.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.059
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.644
-[Abby] Yeah.
-You're all done?

21:52.728 --> 21:54.730
-[Abby] Yeah.
-[Annie] You want to take a bath?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.064
Yeah.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.190
Towel.

21:57.774 --> 21:58.692
-[Annie] Soap.
-Soap.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.902
-I've got the soap.
-And bubbles.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.156
[Annie] And the bubbles.
Let's get the front.

22:04.239 --> 22:08.869
Oh, look, it's Alfalfa. It's Alfalfa.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.539
[chuckles]

22:13.290 --> 22:14.541
[chuckles]

22:21.131 --> 22:22.007
[grunts]

22:42.611 --> 22:44.362
Did you have so much fun with Annie?

22:44.446 --> 22:45.447
Yes.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.032
-This book?
-Yeah.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.285
Yeah. Isn't it nice for Annie to help us?

22:50.368 --> 22:53.246
-Yeah.
-Yeah. She's so nice.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.373
-This.
-Yeah.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.543
Yeah.  No More Noisy Nights.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.384
Oh, hey, I got this.
Don't worry about this.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.053
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.888
I wanted to clean up a little before--

23:09.971 --> 23:11.181
You've done so much. Thank you.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.557
-Really? I--
-Yeah.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.727
-I don't want to be in your way.
-This is so much easier with two people.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.437
You have no idea, so--

23:17.521 --> 23:19.773
Oh, yeah, truly. [chuckles]

23:20.524 --> 23:23.443
I did it for three days and I don't know
how you do it all the time.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.946
Well, I'm doing a really shitty job.
That's how.

23:26.029 --> 23:27.030
No. No.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.700
I was supposed to have my mom
come and help but--

23:31.284 --> 23:33.370
uh, she's too old to help.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.956
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.751
I just think it's probably a bad idea
to have her come.

23:39.835 --> 23:44.005
Well, you know,
I don't want to impose or anything,

23:44.089 --> 23:47.259
but if you would want,
I could come by and help,

23:47.342 --> 23:48.635
whenever you needed.

23:48.718 --> 23:51.513
Oh, yeah. I mean, I can-- I definitely--

23:51.596 --> 23:53.807
We would love to have you babysit,
you know.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.350
You wouldn't even have to pay me.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.227
I would come over and hang out

23:57.310 --> 24:01.690
and watch Abby when you need
or whatever you would need.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.234
No pressure.
If your mom is the better option--

24:04.317 --> 24:06.736
-Oh, no. She's definitely not.
-[both chuckle]

24:06.820 --> 24:08.738
-[stutters] Well--
-I mean--

24:09.531 --> 24:15.120
you just would be cool helping out
and hanging out with Abby or--

24:15.203 --> 24:19.583
Yeah. We could even, if you wanted,
make a schedule or something

24:19.666 --> 24:22.919
and we could have times I'm here
and times I'm not--

24:24.004 --> 24:29.968
I just know that the past few days
have been so good for me, too.

24:30.051 --> 24:33.847
It's been a kind of rough time for me
and--

24:33.930 --> 24:35.557
-I'm sorry.
-No. That's okay.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.309
It's nothing, really. It's just--

24:37.392 --> 24:41.438
I feel like I would be so happy
to be a part of, you know,

24:41.521 --> 24:43.690
taking care of her when you need and--

24:44.232 --> 24:46.109
There's no pressure, though.
So you know...

24:46.193 --> 24:49.946
Yeah, no. I mean, that sounds--

24:51.865 --> 24:54.451
I don't know.
That sounds like it could work.

24:54.534 --> 24:58.330
Uh, I just gotta think about it
and figure some stuff out.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.540
-Yeah.
-Can I let you know later?

25:00.624 --> 25:02.918
Totally. Just-- Yeah, let me know.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.503
I will get out of your hair.
You just got home.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.464
You need to have a night, so--
[chuckles]

25:07.547 --> 25:09.132
Listen, thank you so much.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.301
-You saved me this weekend.
-Oh, yeah. No. Of course.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.638
"I'll be a part of your family."
[exclaims]

25:14.721 --> 25:18.016
And it's so awkward. It was like
asking a family out. [chuckles]

25:18.099 --> 25:20.018
You know, "Hey, wanna hang out more?"

25:20.101 --> 25:23.271
-That's cool.
-Oh, no. I felt so weird about it, though.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.358
You shouldn't feel weird about it.
She's probably so excited

25:26.441 --> 25:29.069
and if she took a moment's pause
to think about it,

25:29.152 --> 25:31.363
it's probably because
she's super stressed out.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.114
Yeah, that's true.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.741
I'm sure she's got a million things
on her mind.

25:34.824 --> 25:38.411
She'd be so obviously lucky to have you

25:38.495 --> 25:41.998
as a part of the situation.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.417
[chuckles] I feel like
we're talking about a guy.

25:44.501 --> 25:48.922
I'm like, "What was he thinking?
What did he mean by that pause? Hmm."

25:49.005 --> 25:50.548
More people should date families.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.591
-Right?
-Yeah.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.759
I know. It could be a--

25:53.927 --> 25:56.012
-I don't know.
-It's the way of the future.

25:56.096 --> 26:00.225
Or at least like a pause on my maternal--

26:00.308 --> 26:03.395
I get to be a mom, but not be a mom,
but be a mom. [chuckling]

26:03.478 --> 26:05.480
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

26:06.273 --> 26:08.817
I really wanna be a mom. [chuckles]

26:08.900 --> 26:10.193
I know you do.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.196
-Soon.
-Yeah.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.367
Are you gonna move out
of this apartment? [chuckles]

26:17.450 --> 26:20.954
No. No.
Not like I'm moving into their house.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.623
Although, oddly, their pull-out couch
is very comfortable.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.459
-Okay. Enough about the pull-out.
-[chuckles]

26:42.559 --> 26:44.602
[cell phone buzzing]

26:56.698 --> 26:57.866
Hello.
