for a very vulnerable

Right. Minute amounts

27:12.215 --> 27:14.797
- Is it poisonous?
- No, but it makes sense
to ask ourselves...

27:14.884 --> 27:17.500
what processes might result
in crystalline calcium oxalate.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.507
- Liver or kidneys.
- Kidney function would do that
to plain old oxalate,

27:20.598 --> 27:22.213
which is derived
from glycolate.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.722
- Glycolate’s poisonous.
- Glycolate is a conversion
of glycolaldehyde,

27:26.813 --> 27:29.600
via the aldehyde
dehydrogenase
in the liver.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.227
A poison that isn’t a poison
until it’s metabolized?

- Ethylene glycol.

F.B.I. stall tactics,
Bones. Thank you.
Do not thank me.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.193
He’ll be outta here
in 24 hours.

36:39.281 --> 36:43.320
And even if you prove
that Gallo and Fargood
are the same man,

36:43.410 --> 36:47.574
I don’t see a shred of evidence
proving that he killed
those 12 people.

36:59.593 --> 37:04.587
/ need proof that before he was
Gal/o, our bad guy was Fargood,
so lneed the van.

37:04.681 --> 37:07.058
What are the chances
of finding a vehicle
stolen 10 years ago?

37:07.142 --> 37:09.394
And / need this.

37:09.478 --> 37:12.515
You want us to find
a 10-year-old stolen van and
a speargun all in the next—

37:12.606 --> 37:14.938
- Twelve hours, tops.
- [Man] on, you gotta
be kidding me.

37:15.025 --> 37:19.064
- Go! Perform miracles.
- Let’s see if we can get a make
and model on that speargun.

37:19.154 --> 37:23.147
Even miracles aren’t gonna help
if we can’t prove that Fargood
and Gallo are the same persons.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.410
What is that?
Avalon’s
Harbingers certificate.

37:25.494 --> 37:28.361
Remember, she said Fargood
applied these seals himself.

37:28.455 --> 37:32.198
The saliva on the seal
is how we get
Fargood’s D.N.A.,

37:32.292 --> 37:34.248
but how do we get Gallo’s?

37:34.336 --> 37:37.624
Human nature.
Human nature, Bones.

37:37.714 --> 37:39.796
[ Elevator Bell Dings]

37:39.925 --> 37:42.758
You found Tom Fargood?
Well, that’s what we
need you to tell us.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.377
Only if you’re up to it.
Why wouldn’t I be?

37:45.472 --> 37:48.259
Because all these years, you
thought your sister left you
without saying good-bye.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.261
When, really, this man here
murdered Jenny.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.219
And then buried her
in a mass unmarked grave.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.850
Why are you trying to
make this harder for me?

37:57.526 --> 37:59.482
[Brennan ]
is that Tom Fargood?

38:14.751 --> 38:17.538
[Booth ]
This the man that murdered
your little sister?

38:19.548 --> 38:21.709
[ Exhales ]
[ Screams ]

38:22.718 --> 38:24.208
You killed my sister!
Get her off me!

38:24.303 --> 38:28.296
You killed my little sister!
You sit there so smug!

38:28.432 --> 38:31.094
[ Screams ]
You killed my sister!
[ Caroline] That is sneaky.

38:31.185 --> 38:33.141
ls sneaky good or bad?

38:33.228 --> 38:35.219
Good, if it holds up
in court.

38:35.314 --> 38:39.398
Next time, make it look more
like you’re taking advantage of
a situation, not scripting it.

38:39.485 --> 38:43.854
Don’t keep me hangin’, people.
Are Alexander Gal/o and
Tom Fargood the same person?

38:43.947 --> 38:46.939
Yep. Perfect match.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.025
Your facial expression suggests
that you are dissatisfied.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.110
You proved that Gallo
was Fargood. Fine.

38:51.246 --> 38:55.410
But now you gotta prove that
Fargood killed those people and
dumped them under that fountain.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.538
Just charge him with murder.
Give us time to find
the speargun and the van.

38:58.629 --> 39:01.587
- Chen, what are the chances
of that happening?
- A million to one.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.289
Oh, we don’t have
all the variables, so—

39:04.384 --> 39:08.377
You’re not being precise.
You’re simply illustrating
the difficulty.

39:08.472 --> 39:11.305
Everything maybe adds up
all the time in the lab,

39:11.391 --> 39:14.258
but in real life,
sometimes you lose one.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.719
Well, what should we do—
kill him?

39:17.898 --> 39:20.105
Still in earshot, chérie.
Still in earshot.

39:25.656 --> 39:28.147
Fargood is going to get away
with mass murder.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.275
I don’t wanna
talk about work.
What do you wanna talk about?

You all right?
Not really.

39:37.125 --> 39:41.414
ljust— l have something
that I wanna say to you
from inside my heart.

39:41.505 --> 39:44.417
Blood is in your heart.

39:44.508 --> 39:47.921
The idea that the heart
is the seat of love and
strength of character...

39:48.011 --> 39:50.218
is ancient,
but metaphoric.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.887
I mean, in reality,
these qualities are
based in the amygdala,

39:52.975 --> 39:54.886
which is part
of the brain.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.013
No. I mean, ever since
I woke from my coma,

39:57.104 --> 39:59.516
I’ve been wanting
to say something to you
aboutyou.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.562
Well, why didn’t you
say something earlier?

40:01.650 --> 40:03.766
Because I just wanted
to finish this case,

40:03.860 --> 40:06.476
to make sure that I’m back,
that, you know—
and I’m me again.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.154
Does the fact that
we didn’t close the case
give you doubts?

40:09.241 --> 40:12.199
No. We did
the best we can.
Hold on. You don’t—

40:12.327 --> 40:14.739
You don’t think
I’m fully back?
No, I know you’re fully back.

40:14.871 --> 40:17.408
You do?
Well, you’re wearing
your socks.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.976
Right. Oh, before my coma,
I shot a clown off
an ice-cream truck.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.401
Yeah.

40:50.240 --> 40:53.653

wanna tell me?

That I love you.

Mmm.

[ Booth ]
Okay. What’s going on?

41:30.947 --> 41:33.734
I thought I’d give you
the honor of arresting
Mr. Fargood—

41:33.825 --> 41:35.861
Alexander Gallo—
whatever you wanna call him.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.610
Hell, arrest both of him.
But you said we didn’t
have enough evidence.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.572
For murder. We didn’t
have enough to charge him
with murder.

41:41.667 --> 41:45.285
But murder isn’t the only
crime in the world it just
seems like that around us.

41:45.379 --> 41:48.246
- Grand theft auto
regarding the rental van?
- Fraud by wire?

41:48.340 --> 41:51.457
That man sold people
a luxury hotel
under the sea.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.758

then he defrauded them.

-lllegal wearing of the uniform.
-Those poopie suits were navy issue.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.923
These are just
federal crimes, mind you.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.349
I’ve got the district attorney
coming up with his own list.

42:01.478 --> 42:04.094
What does this add up to?
About a hundred years,
give or take.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.020
He should be
convicted of murder.

42:06.108 --> 42:09.692

to pick up the slack
when you fall short.

That’s right.

for killing your sister.

Sometimes you gotta just settle
for the second-best situation.

42:28.964 --> 42:33.879
I’m sorry, too,
for how we manipulated you
into scratching his face.

42:34.010 --> 42:36.342
It was rational.
Yes.

42:39.599 --> 42:42.557

only your top layer is rational.

Underneath, you’re
as crazy as I am.

- And that’s a compliment.
