50:47.003 --> 50:48.914
I'm Jason's demon whore.

50:49.088 --> 50:51.670
I'm the girl that you tried
to get James to rape.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.297
-Jess. Jessica.
SARAH: Aah!

50:53.468 --> 50:54.753
Quiet, antidote.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.557
You look well.

51:07.732 --> 51:09.563
Well, I'm feeling pretty well.

51:12.237 --> 51:14.774
-You'|| tell no one about this.
-You know we won't.

51:20.536 --> 51:22.072
Go ahead.

51:28.044 --> 51:29.830
Oh, thank God.

51:34.634 --> 51:36.215
[SARAH WHIMPERS]

51:38.721 --> 51:40.336
PAM:
What the fuck are you waiting for?

51:40.515 --> 51:43.427
Drink the bitch and leave before we all die.

51:55.863 --> 51:57.569
No.

52:03.788 --> 52:05.995
I don't want the blood.
