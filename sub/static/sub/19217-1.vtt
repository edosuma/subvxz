00:23.900 --> 00:30.940
The sea is watching...

00:30.940 --> 00:37.990
The beginning of the world...

00:37.990 --> 00:44.230
The sea knows...

00:44.230 --> 00:51.840
Of the end of the world...

00:51.840 --> 00:59.090
So it shows...

00:59.090 --> 01:06.160
The path to be followed...

01:06.160 --> 01:12.570
So he guides us...

01:12.570 --> 01:19.440
Towards a correct world...

01:20.740 --> 01:34.890
Pain, suffering, he collects it all...

01:34.890 --> 01:49.240
Big and gentle, he cuddles them all...

02:22.670 --> 02:28.580
I will destroy
 all pirates!

02:59.240 --> 03:02.850
I'll just follow master Z.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.190
Mosa Mosa

03:10.840 --> 03:15.060
Mosa Mosa! Mosa Mosa!

03:15.060 --> 03:16.430
Catch this!

03:20.960 --> 03:24.400
I'll also follow master Z.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.660
Smash Buster!

04:08.980 --> 04:11.950
Smash Buster!

05:48.440 --> 05:50.680
Retreat! Fall back!

05:51.110 --> 05:52.250
Master Z...

05:55.820 --> 05:59.010
How long has it been?
 Master.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.260
What brings you here?

06:01.260 --> 06:02.930
Borsalino!

06:02.990 --> 06:09.330
I've warned you not to depend too much on you're <i>Pika Pika no Mi </i> power.

06:09.330 --> 06:12.340
You're still hard as rock,
 like always.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.370
Master Zephyr.

06:15.970 --> 06:18.440
I abandoned that name.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.880
I am Z!

06:26.680 --> 06:30.980
Don't you think you're feeling
 too sure of yourself

06:31.170 --> 06:34.140
by becoming "Admiral Kizaru" of the Navy?!

06:34.120 --> 06:38.160
I didn't come here to remember the past.

07:07.560 --> 07:12.730
You won't be able to match my speed with that heavy weapon.

07:12.730 --> 07:16.200
What will you use the
 Dyna Rocks for?

07:16.530 --> 07:20.640
Since ancient times,
 I never got along with you!

07:24.970 --> 07:28.380
Come, return the Dyna Rocks.

07:28.380 --> 07:31.910
They say that the Dyna Rocks
 rival the Ancient Weapons.

07:31.910 --> 07:37.190
How about we use them
 to celebrate our reunion?

07:39.520 --> 07:45.700
Dyna Rocks cause a massive explosion
 when exposed to oxygen.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.330
Let's Go!

08:08.120 --> 08:09.390
Master Z!

08:23.570 --> 08:25.640
Damm!

08:28.370 --> 08:33.539
What in the hell is the Navy doing?

08:48.590 --> 08:49.930
Come on!

08:51.930 --> 08:53.730
Come on, baby!

09:00.440 --> 09:04.640
I'm always a
 lively skeleton.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.380
Come on!

09:08.750 --> 09:11.780
It's good drinking while watching
 the cherry blossoms.

09:11.780 --> 09:13.180
Right, Chopper?

09:13.180 --> 09:17.750
Yes! I love drinking milk
 while watching the leaves as well!

09:17.750 --> 09:23.290
Cherry... No, It's me!

09:23.720 --> 09:25.790
<i> Super! </i>

09:27.760 --> 09:29.730
Meat!

09:34.370 --> 09:36.770
It stinks!
 I smell poison!

09:38.980 --> 09:40.480
It's a deadly poison!

09:41.510 --> 09:42.980
What is it, Chopper?

09:43.310 --> 09:44.810
He was poisoned?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.520
Chopper!

09:46.520 --> 09:48.450
He took poison...

09:48.450 --> 09:50.050
I remembered!

09:50.050 --> 09:51.990
Do you have any idea of what it is?

09:52.360 --> 09:55.330
Listen to this song..."The poison I took".

09:55.330 --> 09:56.660
It's a song?!

09:59.000 --> 10:01.200
Now that I think about it,
 the taste of the drink is...

10:01.800 --> 10:05.670
Wait, or was it
 always like this?

10:13.910 --> 10:15.550
They are always so lively.

10:17.210 --> 10:21.480
Plant care,
 taking care of plants.

10:21.480 --> 10:26.190
Come on, my children!
 I want you to give birth to a lot of Pop Greens!

10:26.190 --> 10:31.690
The worms exterminator,
 the great Usopp, shall protect them!

10:31.690 --> 10:32.860
Usopp!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.670
So it's your fault!

10:35.670 --> 10:39.500
Look! Chopper was
 caught by the poisonous milk!

10:39.500 --> 10:41.700
It's your fault
 for being there!

10:41.700 --> 10:44.510
The poison is
 for killing worms!

10:44.510 --> 10:48.170
If you die, it means you are worms!

10:48.220 --> 10:53.680
Well, then we can relax.
 After all, we are not insects.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.390
So, are you ok?

10:56.850 --> 11:00.860
The taste is a bit different,
 but it's also pretty good.

11:01.820 --> 11:05.960
It's a little bitter...
 is it because I'm becoming an adult?

11:06.460 --> 11:08.260
Let me try it.

11:10.230 --> 11:11.400
That's horrible!

11:11.930 --> 11:14.640
Agricultural chemicals
 also affect the human body.

11:16.670 --> 11:22.110
I am the cherry tree...
 I'm slowly spreading...

11:22.110 --> 11:26.720
Luffy, the cherry tree!
 The autumn will end.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.690
Wait a bit more, cherry!
 Lets go!

11:29.690 --> 11:31.800
It's south... I'm going south!

11:31.870 --> 11:32.620
Change of course!

11:32.620 --> 11:34.460
Damn you, why
 did you spilled my drink?

11:34.460 --> 11:37.130
Frankly, they make so much noise...

11:37.630 --> 11:41.360
Why can't you rest quietly?

11:41.360 --> 11:44.130
Hey, be quiet! Damn it.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.540
Nami!

11:45.540 --> 11:49.540
Delivery of the special orange juice!

11:49.540 --> 11:51.310
Thank you, Sanji.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.940
I'd also love some dessert!

11:55.510 --> 11:58.080
Nami! Yes,
 with pleasure!

11:58.080 --> 11:59.780
Hey, Sanji!

12:00.220 --> 12:03.250
I also want dessert! And meat!

12:03.250 --> 12:05.820
I want some candies!

12:05.820 --> 12:06.960
Me too!

12:06.960 --> 12:08.490
I want cola!

12:08.490 --> 12:10.330
My drink is ending!

12:10.330 --> 12:12.130
I want dessert too!

12:12.130 --> 12:14.130
Shut up, bastards!

12:14.130 --> 12:17.130
When you ask something to someone,
it has to be politely, you idiots!

12:17.130 --> 12:20.540
I was born only
 for the ladies!

12:28.880 --> 12:29.980
It taste bad!

12:30.480 --> 12:33.750
Hey, Usopp, your poison is here again.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.790
I'm not using it anymore!

12:36.350 --> 12:37.450
What is this?

12:38.590 --> 12:39.690
It's snow!

12:39.690 --> 12:42.130
No, its not freezing to be snow.

12:42.130 --> 12:43.360
What is it?

12:44.860 --> 12:47.230
This is... volcanic ashes!

12:48.200 --> 12:49.900
Volcanic ashes?!

15:05.640 --> 15:07.640
That's disgusting!

15:07.970 --> 15:10.840
The ashes entered
 your fur, did it not?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.580
Let's take a bath together after.

15:12.580 --> 15:13.470
- Bath?

15:13.530 --> 15:14.440
 -Together?!

15:14.440 --> 15:17.020
Today
 is not my bath day...

15:17.030 --> 15:20.750
But I'll take it,
 this is very disgusting.

15:20.750 --> 15:24.050
Me... Can I take a bath
 with you as well?

15:24.420 --> 15:26.590
Can I?

15:26.590 --> 15:30.860
Look, my face
 is also disgusting!

15:35.530 --> 15:37.870
Don't hurt your
 feelings by what you said.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.570
No...

15:42.610 --> 15:45.610
Brooke, you can
 take a bath with me!

15:45.610 --> 15:47.210
I love you, Chopper!

15:48.180 --> 15:51.850
Hey, Nami!
 Do you have any idea?

15:51.850 --> 15:55.050
The needle that pointed to the direction that came the volcanic ashes

15:55.050 --> 15:57.050
began rotating randomly.

15:57.050 --> 15:58.590
It is a strange movement.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.760
It looks like a lost child
 who lost their parents.

16:03.990 --> 16:06.630
Lost?
 How so?

16:06.630 --> 16:10.530
For example, the volcanic eruption that released those ashes,

16:10.530 --> 16:13.400
could've exploded the entire island.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.840
And because of that
 the needle stopped pointing?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.840
That's impossible!

16:18.840 --> 16:20.610
This is the New World!?

16:20.910 --> 16:23.810
That's right, you bastard.
 Don't be surprised.

16:23.810 --> 16:27.880
Disappear before the beauty of Nami.
 You cherry shit.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.450
Nami, some tea.

16:29.450 --> 16:30.520
Thank you.

16:30.990 --> 16:35.790
Anyway, we have to avoid at all cost, the island the needle was pointing at.

16:36.490 --> 16:38.860
In that case, Nami...

16:38.860 --> 16:42.470
There is someone we can't
 show that pointer by any means.

16:42.470 --> 16:43.800
That's true.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.600
Choosing the safest route

16:45.600 --> 16:48.740
and guarantee the
 crew life is my job.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.340
Hey, that needle is
 moving very interestingly!

16:53.780 --> 16:54.780
Luffy!?

16:55.950 --> 16:57.180
Let's go there!

16:57.180 --> 16:59.120
Crap!
 He saw it!

16:59.120 --> 17:01.120
I smell adventure!

17:01.480 --> 17:06.890
Wait, Luffy! You didn't listed correctly!
 According to Nami, those ashes were...

17:06.890 --> 17:10.160
Hey, guys!
 Our route has been decided!

17:10.160 --> 17:11.589
Get ready!

17:11.589 --> 17:12.960
Luffy!...

17:16.970 --> 17:19.240
But...

17:19.240 --> 17:22.010
If the pointer is crazy,
 how will we know where the island is...

17:22.010 --> 17:23.440
Be quiet.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.640
I'm a navigator.

17:25.640 --> 17:29.510
If we decide to go,
 I can take you anywhere.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.580
Luffy, keep an eye out.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.020
Leave it to me!

17:34.350 --> 17:37.650
Hey, is it really alright
 choosing it like this?

17:37.650 --> 17:42.590
In the New World, the path you
 choose can cost us our lives.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.960
Franky,
 Turn 20 degrees to port.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.630
Turning 20 degrees
 to port.

17:47.630 --> 17:49.070
Hey, do you hear me?

17:49.070 --> 17:52.240
We don't know what might happen,
 so prepare yourselves!

17:53.070 --> 17:54.740
We can't do anything.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.010
After all, he is the captain.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.760
But we don't want to get
 involved with volcanoes

18:12.760 --> 18:16.760
or anything that can
 threaten our lives!

18:21.060 --> 18:22.530
Castaway located.

18:22.530 --> 18:24.330
Prepare to rescue him immediately!

18:26.740 --> 18:27.940
He's being dragged!

18:28.300 --> 18:29.510
Leave it to me!

18:34.780 --> 18:36.650
Luffy, whats wrong?

18:36.650 --> 18:40.720
I'm running out of strength...

18:42.450 --> 18:47.260
Pull, pull!

18:47.260 --> 18:50.060
Luffy, don't let go yet!

18:55.600 --> 18:57.700
Luffy, are you ok?

19:01.270 --> 19:03.640
So? Is he alive?

19:04.340 --> 19:07.620
His heart rate and
breathing are weak, but
he's only passed out,

19:07.740 --> 19:09.610
he's not in danger.

19:09.910 --> 19:11.110
Really?

19:11.110 --> 19:14.050
I hope we didn't get someone
 problematic again.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.450
A big guy all bruised!

19:16.450 --> 19:19.120
And this business in his left arm...

19:19.120 --> 19:21.090
Just by looking, anyone
 can tell its not just something.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.630
Kairouseki: Sea Stone

19:23.360 --> 19:26.630
Thats really made of Kairouseki.

19:26.630 --> 19:31.130
I get it! Thats why Luffy lost his
strength when he touched it.

19:31.130 --> 19:34.470
A powerful weapon
 made of Kairouseki...

19:34.470 --> 19:37.610
Awesome!

19:37.610 --> 19:38.940
Thats not it!

19:39.180 --> 19:42.810
Kairouseki has the same
 energy as the ocean.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.420
A weapon made from that material...

19:51.450 --> 19:55.020
means that it was made
 to end Devil Fruit users.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.790
He might be an enemy.

19:56.790 --> 20:00.160
and we can't lower our
 guard in the New World.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.570
If you're worried, throw him overboard.

20:02.570 --> 20:04.970
Idiot!
 We can't do that.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.240
I don't want to!

20:06.240 --> 20:09.470
He might kill you as
 soon as you heal him.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.980
Even so, I'm a doctor!
I can't abandon him.

20:15.810 --> 20:17.050
Whats the problem?

20:17.580 --> 20:19.920
Heal him, Chopper.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.490
If he's the
enemy, I'll finish him off.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.720
Is that alright?

20:24.720 --> 20:27.790
Yes! Thank you, Luffy!

20:28.490 --> 20:30.660
Well, as a see warrior,
of course it's alright.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.130
Damn, they are so carefree.

20:38.430 --> 20:41.340
I really have a bad
 feeling about this...

20:41.840 --> 20:43.270
It's exciting, right?

20:43.270 --> 20:45.040
There is no need for
that kind of excitement.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.590
Luffy, it looks like he woke up!

20:59.620 --> 21:01.760
Yes, it seems so.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.030
Hey, crappy cooker.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.560
Shut your mouth.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.560
I know, you shit marimo.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.700
Got that?
 We caught a big fish.

21:13.270 --> 21:14.400
Are you ok?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.070
You don't need to force yourself.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.610
You were floating in the see,
do you remember it?

21:21.610 --> 21:24.380
Yes, I remember.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.680
Thank you for the great treatment.

21:28.150 --> 21:31.750
It looks like I came back
to life, doctor...?

21:31.750 --> 21:32.790
Chopper!

21:32.790 --> 21:36.760
Doctor Chopper.
You are a great medic.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.860
Praising me doesn't
get me happy, you idiot!

21:40.900 --> 21:43.730
You are the captain of this ship?

21:43.730 --> 21:45.000
Can you tell?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.370
Yes I can.

21:46.670 --> 21:49.710
I've seen a lot of
young man like you.

21:49.710 --> 21:52.810
I'm a specialist when it comes to
 understanding your powers.

21:52.810 --> 21:53.840
Really?

21:53.840 --> 21:57.250
What will you do? Stay with us until we arrive to the next island?

21:57.250 --> 22:02.650
Vivre Card: The Paper of Life

21:57.250 --> 22:02.650
I got a Vivre Card, my friends should be using that to get here.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.190
Old man...

22:05.190 --> 22:07.360
thats a cool weapon!

22:07.720 --> 22:09.160
Where do they sell those?

22:09.860 --> 22:12.080
When I lost my arm to a
damn pirate,

22:12.140 --> 22:17.600
a crazy scientist from the Navy
made this one for me.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.540
Battle Smasher.

22:21.370 --> 22:25.140
It's made of Kairouseki,
the weakness of the Devil Fruit users

22:25.140 --> 22:29.180
this way I destroy their power and crush them with this powerful squeeze.

22:30.580 --> 22:34.150
Dr. Chopper, I don't
recommend something heavy like this.

22:34.150 --> 22:35.590
Awesome!

22:35.590 --> 22:37.850
I can't get it off without a special key, so something terrible can happen

22:37.850 --> 22:40.360
if I fall with it
on the ocean.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.260
Old man, are you a Marine?

22:42.260 --> 22:45.330
No. I got too old for that, so I left them.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.630
I'm doing something different now.

22:47.630 --> 22:49.000
What are you doing?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.800
I'm fighting for the
mission I gave myself.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.540
What are you fighting against?

22:56.740 --> 22:59.710
It looks like I'm being questioned.

22:59.710 --> 23:00.910
I'm sorry about that.

23:00.910 --> 23:04.850
It's just that it would be
bad for us if you were a Marine.

23:05.950 --> 23:09.050
Would there be a
problem if I were a Marine?

23:09.050 --> 23:11.550
Yes. After all, we are pirates.

23:13.090 --> 23:16.260
Really?
You are pirates.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.070
Luffy!

23:25.400 --> 23:26.540
Nami, go outside!

23:26.540 --> 23:27.400
Take care of it, please.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.670
How painful... a punch from a
 Kairouseki weapon really works.

23:31.070 --> 23:32.710
Straw Hat...

23:33.610 --> 23:38.010
Why are you a pirate?

23:40.950 --> 23:43.120
To become the Pirate King!

23:46.620 --> 23:48.120
Pirate King...

23:49.590 --> 23:52.030
Pirate King?!

24:05.680 --> 24:07.410
He's strong!

24:13.820 --> 24:14.920
Damn!

24:15.850 --> 24:17.920
Brooke! Let's fight too!

24:17.920 --> 24:18.960
Ok!

24:26.700 --> 24:28.060
They're here?

24:33.970 --> 24:37.370
I am a Vice-Admiral of the New Navy, Ain!

24:37.370 --> 24:41.280
We are confiscating
this pirate ship.

24:41.540 --> 24:45.180
Do not resist.
 You will only shorten your lives.

24:47.180 --> 24:52.320
There is no pirate that doesn't
resist when he's asked not to!

24:54.160 --> 24:55.860
Even we started to attack!

25:02.500 --> 25:05.340
Mosa Mosa!

25:11.170 --> 25:12.580
What the hell is this?

25:12.580 --> 25:13.380
- Thats is...

25:13.390 --> 25:14.840
 -A Devil Fruit user!

25:14.840 --> 25:17.210
Mosa Mosa no Mi ability...

25:17.210 --> 25:21.850
Mosa Mosa no Mi: Fast Growth Fruit

25:17.210 --> 25:21.850
Mosa Mosa Dance can control
every plant there is!

25:30.730 --> 25:32.700
Things look dangerous out there as well.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.230
Let's end this now!

25:37.200 --> 25:38.530
Dos Fleur!

25:38.530 --> 25:39.400
What...

25:41.100 --> 25:43.540
Mosa Mosa!
 Mosa Mosa!

25:44.040 --> 25:46.210
He's so fast that I
 can't establish a target!

25:46.210 --> 25:48.850
Mosa Mosa!
 Mosa Mosa Mosa!

25:50.550 --> 25:51.850
Can't breathe...

25:52.580 --> 25:54.750
Mosa Mosa!
 Mosa Mosa!

25:54.750 --> 25:55.750
Be careful!

25:58.120 --> 25:59.860
Don't come down!

26:00.860 --> 26:02.060
Mosa Mosa!

26:03.930 --> 26:05.930
What is this?...

26:05.930 --> 26:06.740
Stop it!!

26:06.750 --> 26:08.060
Mosa Mosa Mosa!

26:11.900 --> 26:13.570
No!  No!  No!

26:14.800 --> 26:16.270
Tornado Search!

26:14.800 --> 26:16.270
Gust Sword!

26:17.440 --> 26:18.610
Modo: Go Back!

26:17.440 --> 26:18.610
Modo Modo!

26:24.210 --> 26:25.210
Nami!

26:29.320 --> 26:30.690
How dare you do that with Nami?!

26:31.620 --> 26:33.460
Heavy Point!

26:33.460 --> 26:34.590
Modo Modo!

26:39.560 --> 26:40.860
Chopper!

26:46.940 --> 26:50.310
No! Stop...
Don't come close...

26:50.310 --> 26:51.870
No!
No! No!

26:53.440 --> 26:54.510
Brooke!

26:54.510 --> 26:55.510
Stop!!

26:55.510 --> 26:57.150
Seis Fleur!

26:58.480 --> 27:00.120
You are also a
Devil Fruit user, right?

27:00.120 --> 27:02.320
What have you done with
Nami and Chopper?

27:04.790 --> 27:08.060
Robin! Stop using
 your ability!

27:08.520 --> 27:09.590
Modo Modo!

27:16.300 --> 27:20.500
I ate the Mono Mono no Mi.
I am a regressive person.

27:20.870 --> 27:25.340
My ability can transform
anything 12 years in time.

27:25.540 --> 27:28.750
Now you should be about 18 years old.

27:29.350 --> 27:31.010
I'm so tiny!

27:31.010 --> 27:36.390
If I touch you two more times, you will regress 12 years two times, in other words, 24 years,

27:36.390 --> 27:39.060
Making your
 existence disappear.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.860
Smash Buster!

27:56.270 --> 27:58.310
Mosa Mosa!

28:00.710 --> 28:05.720
You'll become the
Pirate King with that power alone?

28:05.720 --> 28:07.550
Don't make me laugh.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.330
Should I crush you like this?

28:17.860 --> 28:20.260
What do you think, Pirate King?

28:21.260 --> 28:22.500
What's you're name?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.940
Monkey D. Luffy.

28:26.740 --> 28:30.610
I get it.
 You're Garp grandson.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.510
Master Z,
I'm happy you're alright.

28:38.510 --> 28:43.920
We're destroying this pirate ship
 with a simultaneous attack from out fleet.

28:44.750 --> 28:45.490
Luffy!

28:45.490 --> 28:47.220
Are you ok, Luffy?

28:50.290 --> 28:54.560
I am the Commander
of the New Navy, Z!

28:55.400 --> 28:59.140
I will obliterate every
single pirate!

28:59.500 --> 29:01.740
Try to survive while you still can.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.810
Pirates!

29:10.610 --> 29:11.710
Damn!

29:11.980 --> 29:13.450
Wait!...

29:15.080 --> 29:20.090
Our fight...
Our fight isn't over yet!

29:27.500 --> 29:28.900
Sunny!...

29:31.170 --> 29:32.470
Damn!

29:33.970 --> 29:37.770
Chopper, take that off!
We're really in danger!

29:41.380 --> 29:42.610
Luffy!

29:43.480 --> 29:45.580
Luffy, let's run!

29:50.850 --> 29:52.620
Franky, let's retreat!

29:56.660 --> 29:59.260
Come on! Damn!

30:00.030 --> 30:02.530
I'm free! Super!...

30:07.800 --> 30:12.180
Come on, Sunny! I believe in you!

30:14.810 --> 30:17.010
Emergency escape system!

30:17.010 --> 30:19.120
Coup D'Burst!

30:50.680 --> 30:52.680
They really did that.

30:53.080 --> 30:59.190
Originally, they are our trump card to protect the Final Points of the pirates.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.760
Using the Dyna Rocks to
destroy the Final Points...

31:05.090 --> 31:11.600
The first Final Point sank
with the base that protected them.

31:11.800 --> 31:16.110
Z objective is to destroy
the three Final Points...

31:16.110 --> 31:19.740
...and destroy the
sea of the New World.

31:19.740 --> 31:26.920
Even that man would get injured if he was caught in the Dyna Rocks explosion.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.220
He's alive.

31:30.250 --> 31:33.800
Everyone here must know this.

31:33.860 --> 31:37.530
He doesn't know when to fall.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.930
Z...

31:38.930 --> 31:43.230
Or rather, former
Admiral of the Navy, Black Fist Zephyr

31:43.500 --> 31:45.740
He is alive.

31:46.570 --> 31:50.640
Either way, we have to recover the Dyna Rocks, no matter the cost.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.940
He may have taken
 care of us in the past...

31:54.280 --> 31:55.860
...but now he is our enemy,

31:55.990 --> 31:57.880
...enemy of justice.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.780
And everyone who's
part of the New Navy...

32:00.780 --> 32:03.420
...even if Z is alive.

32:03.790 --> 32:06.560
They all should be disposed of...

32:08.190 --> 32:09.590
...in the name of justice.

32:10.760 --> 32:16.070
Hunt Z and his New Navy
with all the power of the Navy!

32:16.330 --> 32:20.970
Let's recover the Dyna Rocks
and execute absolute justice!

32:24.440 --> 32:28.480
If the Final Points were destroyed, the world would be as well.

32:28.810 --> 32:33.320
Is that really a lie?

32:33.780 --> 32:38.450
You think that if it was a lie we
would take this so seriously?

32:39.390 --> 32:41.820
I understand what Z is planing.

32:41.820 --> 32:45.090
He wants to end with all the
pirates of the New World.

32:45.500 --> 32:48.930
If he uses the Final Points,
that becomes possible.

32:49.400 --> 32:55.970
But of course, he won't destroy only the pirates, he'll kill all the innocent citizens as well.

32:57.010 --> 33:00.440
Vice-Admiral Garp...
Who is this Z?

33:02.310 --> 33:06.020
A man who was our comrade once.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.620
We were friends.

33:11.650 --> 33:14.960
We should have been comrades.

33:18.160 --> 33:23.770
Zephyr... your anger is
so strong to destroy the world?

33:27.100 --> 33:30.470
Do you hate
 us that much?

33:51.630 --> 33:52.700
Luffy!

33:53.030 --> 33:56.100
I'm going to
completely fix Sunny!

33:56.330 --> 34:01.300
It will take some time, but while
I fix it you'll go after Z, right?

34:01.300 --> 34:03.470
Yes, I'm leaving Sunny with you!

34:05.070 --> 34:09.050
This is for the doctor.
 This if for the load...

34:09.050 --> 34:10.350
I'm so sorry...

34:10.880 --> 34:14.719
All of this because I
wanted to save that Z.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.949
Don't apologize.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.790
A pirate shouldn't regret
doing what he believed in.

34:21.790 --> 34:24.790
It's not your fault.
We all know that.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.300
Thank you.

34:29.570 --> 34:32.940
New Navy...
 Who could that Z be?

34:32.940 --> 34:37.239
When he found out we were pirated, e attacked out of nowhere!

34:38.110 --> 34:41.179
The ability of that
Binz is problematic.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.080
Next time we are going
to settle things straight.

34:45.010 --> 34:48.989
Besides, we need to avenge Sunny, that showed so much bravery.

34:48.989 --> 34:51.190
If it wasn't for Sunny strength,

34:51.190 --> 34:55.760
we would all be swimming at sea because of the Navy attack.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.560
We need to find that New Navy
 and pay them back.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.160
Are you serious?!

35:01.160 --> 35:04.670
I don't want to mess with
those dangerous people again.

35:04.670 --> 35:08.340
Let's just stay in this island
until Sunny is repaired!

35:08.340 --> 35:09.940
What are you talking about?

35:09.940 --> 35:14.380
If we don't find them,
my body won't return to normal!

35:14.580 --> 35:15.850
Me neither!

35:16.380 --> 35:18.550
I don't want to stay like this!

35:19.250 --> 35:22.750
With this body of a child,
I can't do anything!

35:22.750 --> 35:26.490
The navigation in the New World
will be a lot harder!

35:26.490 --> 35:27.620
As navigator...

35:27.620 --> 35:32.000
I need to get back to normal,
so I can guide Sunny Go!

35:32.130 --> 35:33.660
That's right!

35:33.900 --> 35:38.270
I didn't said for you to
 continue like this.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.910
It would be a problem if
I didn't return to normal as well.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.200
I bet you're happy
to be 18 again and

35:44.200 --> 35:46.210
having everything in
the right place again.

35:47.410 --> 35:48.750
I'm sorry!

35:50.280 --> 35:55.280
Honestly. Don't joke around
when our ladies are in trouble.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.890
But, wait a second...

36:00.890 --> 36:04.590
That means I'll be
able to closely follow

36:04.790 --> 36:07.460
Nami's precious days
while her body matures?

36:08.270 --> 36:12.800
I'll be able to see the moment when the larva turns into a beautiful butterfly?!

36:12.800 --> 36:15.240
That's incredibly awesome!

36:16.740 --> 36:17.770
Disgusting.

36:18.270 --> 36:20.110
Hu? I'm going to kill you,
you marimo!

36:20.310 --> 36:24.450
If you went back into a kid,
I'd give you a lesson.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.520
Idiot!...

36:25.520 --> 36:28.480
I'd defeat you even as a kid!

36:28.480 --> 36:29.520
What did you say?

36:29.520 --> 36:33.390
Then I would defeat you even
younger, with 3 year old!

36:33.390 --> 36:34.420
Idiot!...

36:35.360 --> 36:38.290
And I would have defeated
 you when I was a baby!

36:39.000 --> 36:39.890
- Hu?!

36:39.890 --> 36:41.260
 -What did you say?!

36:41.260 --> 36:43.900
This is no time to fight!

36:45.470 --> 36:46.470
You know...

36:46.840 --> 36:50.670
Actually, my
age was also decreased...

36:51.510 --> 36:52.380
It looks like...

36:52.380 --> 36:53.650
It didn't change...

36:53.720 --> 36:54.880
Anything...

36:54.880 --> 36:58.920
I was also touched by
that Ain from the New Navy.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.620
Speaking about it, it's true.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.990
But it didn't change anything...

37:02.990 --> 37:06.620
No! Brooke,
dead and only bones.

37:06.620 --> 37:10.190
I've been a
corpse for more than 50 years...

37:10.190 --> 37:12.330
But something changed
that had never happened before.

37:13.330 --> 37:15.430
My age went back 12 years.

37:15.430 --> 37:21.270
Look, my hair has the
softness of 12 years ago!

37:21.270 --> 37:24.670
No it hasn't!
You painted your hair!

37:25.170 --> 37:28.340
Then were you
happy to rejuvenate?

37:29.010 --> 37:31.310
You don't need to
go back?

37:31.910 --> 37:34.320
Yes, that's right.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.620
No, No! I also want...
to return to normal?

37:38.620 --> 37:39.690
How do I know?!

37:42.590 --> 37:44.600
For us to go back to normal,

37:44.730 --> 37:48.300
we have to gather information
about Z and the New Navy.

37:50.330 --> 37:52.370
Do you need
something, old man?

37:52.370 --> 37:56.370
If it's the price of consulting
 the doctor, talk to our navigator.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.640
Did Z showed up again?

38:00.240 --> 38:02.780
Old man,
do you know Z?

38:02.780 --> 38:09.550
Many pirate ships have been attacked around here and comes to these docks.

38:09.550 --> 38:15.930
All the injured pirates
say they were attacked by Z.

38:18.530 --> 38:21.930
Grandpa told me that when when costumers come to the docks,

38:21.930 --> 38:25.500
they are all pirates
 saying they were attacked by Z.

38:26.040 --> 38:29.240
They come to fix their ships
 and they use the docks,

38:29.240 --> 38:34.110
We receive the ships that
 were totally destroyed by the navy.

38:34.540 --> 38:36.350
My grandpa was a sailor,

38:36.470 --> 38:41.050
so he takes care of the pirates or
anyone that comes with a problem.

38:41.050 --> 38:44.800
I only like people that risks their
lives here in the New World,

38:44.860 --> 38:48.220
searching
for their dreams.

38:48.660 --> 38:57.500
Many were totally defeated by Z, lost their way and abandoned the New World.

38:57.970 --> 39:02.270
Z is stealing the men
freedom on the sea.

39:02.270 --> 39:07.510
Even if staying by their side
is wrong, I won't accept that.

39:08.110 --> 39:13.150
If you were defeated by Z and
 even so you want to face him,

39:13.150 --> 39:17.820
I'd like to give you my
strongest equipment I have stored.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.780
Strongest equipment?

39:19.840 --> 39:22.600
Amazing! A powerful equipment!

39:22.640 --> 39:23.850
Wait a second!

39:24.130 --> 39:27.060
What, Nami? He said the
 strongest! The strongest!

39:27.060 --> 39:30.570
Before that,
we have to pursue Z!

39:30.570 --> 39:34.670
And with Z attacks, our
clothes were all burned,

39:34.670 --> 39:36.370
So we have to take care of that first.

39:36.710 --> 39:39.680
If we stay the whole
 time with these cherry fantasies,

39:39.680 --> 39:42.510
we're going to raise suspicion when we are looking for information about him.

39:43.010 --> 39:45.580
First we have to gather
information and clothes!

39:45.580 --> 39:48.850
The strongest equipment
 to defeat Z comes after that!

39:48.850 --> 39:50.520
Got it.

39:50.790 --> 39:53.860
Nami is small, but she's
 the boss of it all, right?

39:54.390 --> 39:56.490
Excuse me, do you have any...

39:56.690 --> 40:00.430
big city on this island where we can
get some information and clothes?

40:00.700 --> 40:04.070
This island has nothing
besides our docks.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.670
How about you go to
the neighboring island?

40:08.900 --> 40:11.770
They are very popular
for the hot springs and volcanoes.

40:11.770 --> 40:15.910
And now there is the sea train passing there, it has a lot of people visiting!

40:15.910 --> 40:18.380
Sea train? Are you talking
about that sea train?

40:18.380 --> 40:19.520
Yes.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.510
That's right.
Luffy, Marino, Bones.

40:48.510 --> 40:53.120
You guys are very strange. Leave it to us that we'll gather the information.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.950
Isn't that right, Nami-swan,
 Robin-chwan?

40:55.950 --> 40:57.750
You're strange too, Sanji.

40:58.750 --> 41:02.160
A lover face also won't do.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.130
We will gather
the information!

41:04.130 --> 41:08.830
No... But I wanted to go with you...

41:09.330 --> 41:11.010
Let's enjoy the hot springs.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.840
How about we rest
before the battle?

41:14.500 --> 41:17.980
Leave the new clothes to
me, I'll take care of them.

41:18.170 --> 41:20.680
Looks like there is some
great brands on this island.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.750
Okay, we're here!

41:25.110 --> 41:27.950
Guys, don't get yourselves
 caught by the Navy!

41:27.950 --> 41:29.420
Spread out!

41:40.050 --> 41:44.630
Honestly... Devil Fruit users
are full of weak points!

41:45.150 --> 41:47.340
They lose their
strength even with that?

41:49.570 --> 41:53.020
If we don't get the
upper part wet, we will still survive.

41:54.210 --> 41:55.750
That's nice.

41:55.750 --> 42:02.150
Can we really stay
here wasting our time?

42:02.500 --> 42:05.990
Thats right! I want to beat him up, that Z!

42:05.990 --> 42:07.150
You Idiot!

42:07.210 --> 42:13.330
If a delinquent like you starts walking though out this island full of Marines,

42:14.730 --> 42:16.900
it will cause us trouble again.

42:18.250 --> 42:20.120
Nami told us already, right?

42:20.200 --> 42:24.670
That we're letting them and Chopper gather information about Z?

42:40.120 --> 42:43.360
Good, right?
 A beautiful dancer!...

42:43.360 --> 42:44.930
Everyone is so excited!

42:44.930 --> 42:49.270
I'm happy you
liked it, sir.

42:51.470 --> 42:53.740
Are you going on a date now, sir?

42:53.740 --> 42:56.540
Yes. Leave it shining, please!

42:58.140 --> 43:02.040
I can feel it...
I can feel it in my bones...

43:02.040 --> 43:04.910
Everything goes away
along with the exhaustion.

43:05.580 --> 43:06.680
Z...

43:07.320 --> 43:13.220
I got distracted with the weapon in his arm and I let my guard down.

43:13.220 --> 43:17.890
Since you're a Devil Fruit user, and you attack him without thinking...

43:17.890 --> 43:22.770
and get caught by that Kairouseki arm again, you'll lose all your strength.

43:23.230 --> 43:26.740
Let me and
Marimo take care of Z.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.940
I don't want you to do anything.

43:29.140 --> 43:32.070
I will finish him off.

43:32.070 --> 43:36.310
Next time, I'll dodge that arm of his and attack him with everything I got!

43:36.310 --> 43:39.050
You're lively as always.

43:39.280 --> 43:43.250
I got tired of waiting
 for you guys here.

43:51.490 --> 43:52.900
Aokiji!

43:53.430 --> 43:58.600
What's wrong, guys?
Who is this person?

43:58.600 --> 44:02.410
A Marine! Admiral Aokiji of the Navy!

44:02.770 --> 44:04.440
Admiral?!

44:04.440 --> 44:07.140
Hi there. How long has it been?

44:13.280 --> 44:17.190
We've finished
positioning the Dyna Rocks.

44:17.190 --> 44:18.250
Understood.

44:22.460 --> 44:25.060
When this volcano erupts,

44:26.660 --> 44:29.530
those Navy brats...

44:29.730 --> 44:34.870
Will know of my rage and
 the scale of my hatred.

44:37.270 --> 44:38.660
- Zoro, Sanji!

44:38.660 --> 44:39.390
- Yes!

44:39.410 --> 44:42.610
What does an Admiral
want with me?

44:43.150 --> 44:46.080
Calm down, don't get too excited.

44:47.580 --> 44:49.450
What do you want with us?

44:49.750 --> 44:50.690
Don't tell me...

44:50.690 --> 44:52.860
It's nothing like that.

44:52.860 --> 44:56.560
I don't want to
capture you now.

44:56.560 --> 45:01.630
I left the Navy, you should've known that.

45:01.960 --> 45:05.230
I'm not a Navy Admiral anymore.

45:05.230 --> 45:07.970
Then what are you?

45:08.340 --> 45:12.510
What? I don't like a skeleton asking me that...

45:12.880 --> 45:15.440
But since I'm not an Admiral anymore...

45:16.010 --> 45:17.780
Am I an ally of justice?

45:17.780 --> 45:19.650
No, that's not it...

45:21.450 --> 45:22.750
What am I?

45:22.750 --> 45:23.850
How should I know?

45:24.350 --> 45:30.090
How will we know?! Well, that's it. I have no intention of fighting with you now.

45:30.560 --> 45:37.700
Think about it. If I wished to fight, I wouldn't be in a hot spring where I can't use my powers.

45:39.340 --> 45:41.300
You were waiting for us?

45:41.300 --> 45:42.340
That's right.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.210
I don't want
to stay here anymore...

45:47.010 --> 45:49.650
So, let's talk
about the rest outside.

46:01.260 --> 46:02.530
Ah, this?...

46:02.530 --> 46:07.960
Well, how can I say,
 I got carried away too much.

46:18.270 --> 46:20.880
Chopper, have you found anything?

46:20.880 --> 46:26.220
I heard some rumors that a few Marines came to this island after Z.

46:26.220 --> 46:28.920
But I couldn't get
anything more.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.700
Only rumors, hu?

46:30.760 --> 46:34.570
In the store I'm at,
really has more Marines arriving...

46:34.610 --> 46:41.060
...but I don't know if it's because of Z...
...or due to Robin's popularity.

46:41.100 --> 46:43.150
Robin is that
 much popular?

46:43.200 --> 46:47.410
Just look at how much I got for being her manager!

46:47.450 --> 46:48.900
Awesome!

46:50.990 --> 46:54.080
We can't do
anything with rumors alone.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.180
So, what will we do?

46:56.980 --> 46:59.550
I know! Leave it to me.

47:03.950 --> 47:06.590
What happened to you leg?

47:06.590 --> 47:11.860
Have you ever heard that in the world, there are things that it's best not to ask?

47:11.640 --> 47:12.860
Then I won't ask...

47:13.160 --> 47:17.870
Bu the way, why did
you fought against Akainu?

47:17.870 --> 47:19.100
Aren't you both friends?

47:20.440 --> 47:24.570
Well, well. You're really a
 brat without any consideration..

47:25.340 --> 47:28.240
No comments about that too.

47:29.910 --> 47:32.550
Then, why are you here?

47:32.550 --> 47:34.650
You really don't learn anything.

47:34.650 --> 47:37.390
Well, that I can answer you.

47:37.950 --> 47:38.990
Enjoying the hot springs.

47:39.590 --> 47:41.660
That's what I'd like to say...

47:41.920 --> 47:45.090
But actually,
 I can't stay relaxing too much.

47:45.830 --> 47:48.730
I'm chasing after a certain man.

47:49.130 --> 47:53.170
You guys fought
against a strong guy, right?

47:53.500 --> 47:54.670
Z...

47:55.370 --> 47:58.170
That old man was strong, wasn't he?

47:58.470 --> 48:02.110
After all, he is a former
 Navy Admiral.

48:03.710 --> 48:05.480
Sorry for the wait.

48:05.480 --> 48:06.520
Thank you.

48:06.520 --> 48:09.480
Young lady, you are
very small, but you strive a lot.

48:10.220 --> 48:14.660
Mr. Marine, don't you
have any cool story to tell me?

48:16.930 --> 48:18.660
You know Z?

48:19.130 --> 48:21.730
Young lady,
 how do you know Z?

48:21.730 --> 48:23.470
Everyone knows him!

48:23.700 --> 48:29.710
The adults are talking...
That you've come here to capture Z!

48:29.780 --> 48:33.080
Ah, the rumors are
already saying that?

48:33.080 --> 48:34.210
Ah, hey!

48:34.210 --> 48:35.810
What's the problem?

48:36.550 --> 48:39.080
So, Z is really
in this island?

48:39.080 --> 48:43.120
That's right. We've come here
 to take the bad guy Z.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.920
We are heroes of justice!

48:44.920 --> 48:47.520
So, what is Z objective?

48:47.520 --> 48:50.360
What is he doing
here on this island?

48:50.360 --> 48:51.660
That's enough.

48:52.060 --> 48:54.430
To destroy the End Point.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.300
End Point?...

48:56.800 --> 49:00.270
Is that a lie just to scare me?

49:00.900 --> 49:03.540
It so happens
that it's not a lie...

49:03.540 --> 49:04.940
That's enough!

49:06.710 --> 49:11.180
You guys drank too much already.
You're talking too much.

49:11.180 --> 49:12.750
We're truly sorry, sir!

49:12.750 --> 49:15.720
And you've got a lot
of interest in Z, young lady.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.450
Is there any objective behind that?

49:17.720 --> 49:22.420
No! That man
asked me to ask about Z!

49:22.420 --> 49:23.360
Crap!

49:23.960 --> 49:25.190
It really is a strange man.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.930
Nami threw
the blame on us!

49:29.930 --> 49:31.230
Should we run for it?

49:31.230 --> 49:34.800
It's really a shame, but it's enough disguising myself as a manager.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.110
I have got to work.

49:38.540 --> 49:41.440
Would you come with
me, young lady?

49:43.980 --> 49:45.150
Let me go!

49:45.150 --> 49:46.950
Seis Fleur!

49:52.390 --> 49:54.220
- Let's run away!
- Yes.

49:55.620 --> 49:57.730
- Captain!
- Are you alright?

49:57.960 --> 50:00.600
That's the power of
the Hana Hana no Mi!

50:00.600 --> 50:04.100
That woman is Nico Robin
of the Straw Hat pirates!

50:04.700 --> 50:06.440
Don't let her escape!

50:06.440 --> 50:07.170
Yes, sir!

50:09.370 --> 50:11.740
The world is in the
 Great Era of the pirates.

50:12.310 --> 50:16.750
At sea, arise and vanish pirates
that go after the One Piece.

50:16.750 --> 50:18.350
When some disappear, other are born.

50:19.980 --> 50:25.950
Does pirates appear because the One Piece is on the other side of the sea of the New World?

50:26.460 --> 50:29.560
Or does One Piece exists
because Pirates also exist?

50:30.790 --> 50:33.760
Do dreams come first?
Or is it the people?

50:34.560 --> 50:36.770
In some moments...

50:36.770 --> 50:42.470
when pirates choose their dreams, they loose their happiness and the loved ones cry for them.

50:43.810 --> 50:45.470
What must be done?

50:46.940 --> 50:48.610
Is there an answer?

50:49.680 --> 50:54.280
The former Navy Admiral,
 Z, found an answer by force.

50:54.820 --> 50:58.220
If the One Piece
disappears, so will the pirates.

50:59.490 --> 51:01.760
It's a very simple way of thinking, is it not?

51:02.820 --> 51:08.900
I left the Navy, but I want to see where does the bath that Z has chosen will take him.

51:10.100 --> 51:13.770
But I don't
 know what to do next.

51:18.170 --> 51:19.510
Straw Hat Luffy.

51:19.980 --> 51:25.180
You'll follow your conviction
and face Z again, right?

51:25.180 --> 51:28.950
Show me your
answer.

51:30.290 --> 51:31.450
See you later.

51:32.820 --> 51:35.120
Z is on this island.

51:40.060 --> 51:44.100
Even so well disguised, in the end, we ended up creating a huge conflict!

51:44.100 --> 51:46.600
But we got the information we needed!

51:46.700 --> 51:50.970
Z is on this island!
Despite not knowing what he plans.

51:52.010 --> 51:53.110
There they are!

51:53.840 --> 51:55.040
Go on ahead!

51:55.540 --> 51:59.210
Hissatsu! Midori Bosshi, Devil!

52:04.390 --> 52:05.690
That's it!

52:05.690 --> 52:06.960
Let's regroup with Luffy and the others?

52:06.960 --> 52:07.990
Yes!

52:07.990 --> 52:11.460
What do you think about
 the clothes I got you?

52:11.460 --> 52:15.210
It combines a lot, doesn't it?
 With me, I mean.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.200
- With you?!

52:16.200 --> 52:17.970
I have a great taste.

52:17.970 --> 52:19.500
Shut up...

52:20.270 --> 52:24.540
Try to survive while you
 still can, Pirates!

52:26.940 --> 52:28.710
Luffy, Luffy!

52:29.010 --> 52:30.710
Usopp and the other arrived.

52:33.080 --> 52:35.820
And they brought a lot of friends along.

52:36.220 --> 52:38.750
In the end, they caused a mess.

52:38.950 --> 52:40.420
If so, we should have ...

52:41.890 --> 52:46.830
Hey, Luffy! Let's ask them where Z is,
leave a few unharmed!

52:48.630 --> 52:50.070
Luffy, take care of them...

52:50.430 --> 52:51.370
Please.

53:09.790 --> 53:10.850
That's...

53:11.420 --> 53:13.260
Haoushoku no Haki...

53:13.620 --> 53:16.290
Hey! Where is Z?

53:17.730 --> 53:19.960
On the other side of the island.

53:19.960 --> 53:24.200
My squad should be
chasing him now.

53:45.190 --> 53:46.860
Tekkai!

53:59.530 --> 54:03.410
Your justice is useless.

54:04.670 --> 54:07.910
Justice, freedom...

54:08.710 --> 54:12.050
You'll have to start
everything all over again.

54:34.100 --> 54:38.110
It looks like the
Dyna Rocks worked on this island.

54:38.610 --> 54:43.010
With that, the destruction of the
second End Point was a success.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.920
Grande Imbuto.

54:50.550 --> 54:55.090
We'll achieve that goal when
the third End Point is destroyed.

54:55.890 --> 54:58.260
The pirates will vanish from the sea,

54:58.260 --> 55:02.730
and the world will see
once more, a beautiful dawn.

55:03.830 --> 55:05.570
Gomu Gomu no...

55:06.650 --> 55:09.940
Rifle!

55:13.970 --> 55:15.540
What are you doing here?

55:15.910 --> 55:18.010
You pirate brats...!

55:18.560 --> 55:19.990
Who are you calling a brat?

55:20.090 --> 55:22.620
If you keep talking,
 I'll kill you, old geezer!

55:22.980 --> 55:26.690
Old man! Return
my friends back to normal!

55:26.690 --> 55:28.560
Ain, Binz!

55:28.560 --> 55:29.590
Yes!

55:30.320 --> 55:31.320
Understood.

55:32.460 --> 55:34.660
I'll take care of the swordsman.

55:34.660 --> 55:37.700
Damn Marimo!
Going ahead like that...

55:37.700 --> 55:41.470
Right! I don't even need
to fight! Go on, guys!

55:43.800 --> 55:45.810
Mosa!

55:45.810 --> 55:47.410
Mosa, Mosa, Mosa!

55:52.510 --> 55:58.120
When a pirate wants something,
they take it by force, right?

55:58.320 --> 56:02.020
If you want to return your friends to normal, come and get it the pirate way!

56:02.380 --> 56:04.660
Damn! We've got not choice.

56:04.680 --> 56:05.460
Usopp!

56:06.030 --> 56:08.730
I'm going to
fight Z one on one.

56:09.530 --> 56:10.530
Luffy!

56:14.290 --> 56:15.240
Z...!

56:49.800 --> 56:51.340
Help me!

56:52.250 --> 56:53.780
We won't be able to run away!

56:53.780 --> 56:55.390
Someone help us!

56:59.560 --> 57:01.050
Stop right there.

57:07.800 --> 57:13.140
Ladies, go to
the sea train and be careful.

57:14.590 --> 57:16.160
Thank you very much!

57:27.630 --> 57:30.180
Doesn't he care
 about anyone?

57:30.870 --> 57:33.110
Isn't this too much craziness?

57:35.670 --> 57:39.050
This time you wont
catch me with that weapon!

57:43.190 --> 57:45.990
You accelerated the flow of your blood.

57:45.990 --> 57:49.610
To increase the skills
of your body over the limit?

57:49.650 --> 57:52.200
Gear Second!

58:08.050 --> 58:10.780
You said you'd become the Pirate King, Right?

58:10.780 --> 58:14.420
Yes! I'll find the One Piece
and become the Pirate King!

58:14.530 --> 58:16.320
I get it now...

58:16.340 --> 58:19.020
But do you have determination?

58:19.260 --> 58:23.160
Are you determined
to risk your own life?

58:23.160 --> 58:24.100
I am!

58:24.100 --> 58:26.730
But what about your
 friends?!

58:40.380 --> 58:44.120
Are you prepared to sacrifice your friends in order to fulfill your objective

58:44.120 --> 58:47.950
and walk on top of
their corpses to continue?

58:58.260 --> 59:00.630
Hurry up! Their not here yet?

59:00.630 --> 59:04.970
If we wait too long, we'll
also be caught by the volcano!

59:09.540 --> 59:10.610
Are they...

59:11.240 --> 59:12.810
...alright?

59:15.080 --> 59:16.280
Modo, Modo!

59:17.220 --> 59:18.320
That's enough!

59:18.550 --> 59:22.960
If we find each other
again, I'll kill you next time.

59:32.100 --> 59:33.830
Time's up!

59:34.100 --> 59:36.670
Look at this!

59:41.040 --> 59:42.470
She ran away?

59:46.910 --> 59:48.710
What a crazy ninja...

59:56.720 --> 01:00:02.690
If you stay always afraid of this Smasher, you won't hit me with any attack!

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.430
Who said I was afraid?!...

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.740
Fear and pain weaken
your determination.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:14.110
Smash Tornado!

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.460
I'm a rubber man, bullets wont work!

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.490
Really?

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:40.730
I'm loosing my strength...

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.100
Your body won't move anymore.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.770
This ammo is
made of Kairouseki.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.510
You didn't expected this, did you?

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:52.780
After all, it's not an easy
task getting Kairouseki.

01:00:53.810 --> 01:01:00.150
This thing wouldn't hit the most powerful who live here in the New World,

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:05.820
but works wonders on those who are too convinced in their own power and let their guard down.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:10.600
You too
 are a sinful man.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.670
This straw hat
 also got old...

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:24.180
I'm going to bury it with my own hands, together with this Great Pirate Age.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.550
Give it back!

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:33.350
I got that hat from
Shanks, to take care of it!

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.150
I promised I would find
him and give him that hat back!

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.320
Give it back!

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:43.030
The one who dragged you into this pirate business was Shanks, the redhead?!

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.500
His sins are also deep...

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.700
Give it back.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.870
Don't you worry.

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.810
When my plan, the Grande
Imbuto get's completed,

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.580
He will have
the same fate as you.

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.380
Those convinced fools who call them selves the Four Emperors...

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:08.350
Will all die without being able to do anything... Without even knowing of my plan.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.860
Don't mock...

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:12.390
...on Shanks!

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:25.800
That's not good!

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.340
It seems that the
 pyroclastic flow began.

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:30.780
Usopp!

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.010
Where is Luffy?...

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:32.980
Luffy!

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.550
Luffy! Luffy!

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.010
Luffy!

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.620
Luffy!

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:44.760
We can't do anything against that.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.920
Lets go, guys!

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:54.130
How fast is that, really?

01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:56.640
They say its more than 100 KM/h!

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.070
I get it!

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.740
I know! If this is a descent,

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.270
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:03.940
Boaty Banana!

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.810
Jump!

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.020
We need more speed!

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:14.690
It has no engine! It's just a boat!

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.320
Look out!
We're gonna hit!

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.020
It also has no helm!
 It's just a boat!...

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.130
To the right!

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.430
Now it's divided in two!

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.900
We won't make it!

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.270
Damn it!

01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:09.940
They're here!

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:30.070
Those are some nice fireworks, huh!

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:32.510
It blew up the entire island...

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.370
Master... What
about that straw hat guy?

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:47.340
The fire mountain
will decide his fate.

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:52.050
One Piece?
 Everything in this world?

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.620
What a ridiculous dream.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:59.560
How many sacrifices do they think it took? How much suffering and hatred?

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:08.900
They can call that will, freedom... If that's what they call the new age, then I'll squash it all!

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:15.970
I'll use my own hands to get rid of all the pirates in this world, to the very last.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:21.880
Your dreams will
end in deep hatred.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:28.890
I, Z, will close the
 curtains on the Great Pirate Age!

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.760
What happened to him
in the past was really terrible.

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:42.170
But causing a tragedy like this, involving innocent civilians as a motive...

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:43.930
It is not right...

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.540
Dry as always...

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:51.480
Not everyone can easily
separate things like you do.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.950
Am I right, Sengoku?

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.210
Vice-Admiral Garp!

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.710
What is it?

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:13.920
Z... No, the former Marine, Admiral Zephyr...
 What kind of person was he?

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:22.330
He, more than anyone,
 believed in the Navy justice.

01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:26.540
Then why is he
doing this?

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.180
A certain accident happened.

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:30.850
An accident?

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:34.650
Zephyr was a serious man.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.890
Even on the dangerous battlefields, he was always in front of his subordinates,

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:44.690
and he risked his life fighting
against the rivals of that era.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.100
He became an Admiral of
the Navy when he was still young.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:57.940
And when he was living an happy life, his wife and son were killed by a pirate that hated Zephyr.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:03.150
By fully understanding the burden of
 having a position as a Navy Admiral...

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:07.480
Zephyr kept that hatred and
sadness in the bottom of his heart

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.290
and continued his mission.

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:19.160
The years passed and Zephyr pledged himself on training the young Marines. The man who created all Marines...

01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:27.100
Every soldier that raised their
patents lately, are his apprentices.

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:30.770
I want to
create a hero.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:36.160
However, a bigger
tragedy fell upon him.

01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:49.450
The training ship of the new
 recruits commanded by Zephyr

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:53.890
was attacked by a pirate
 with Devil Fruit powers.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:59.450
And only Zephyr and two more survived, everyone else were killed. Zephyr lost his arm.

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:01.620
Took an arm from a Navy Admiral?

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:07.000
And then, Zephyr got a weapon to defeat Devil Fruit users, from the Navy scientists.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.300
And together with his disciples,
he created an attack unit.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:15.640
And he hunted down
Devil Fruit users.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.640
He was still in the Navy,

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:23.500
but that was when they
weren't disappointed with the Navy.

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:36.109
And then, the only thing that was keeping him in the Navy was destroyed.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:44.819
That year, the pirate that had killed his disciples,
was chosen to be a War Lord by the government.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:50.490
And so, Zephyr left the navy.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:54.300
And now he showed
 up in the New World.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:59.609
Hating pirates...
Disappointed with the Navy...

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:04.040
Leading the organization
he created, the New navy.

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:08.330
The unacceptable reality...

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.189
has changed that man.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.319
You suck, Navy!

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:21.109
Why does Black Fist
Zephyr is called Z now?

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.160
Z...

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.689
Who knows?

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:32.770
I can't say that. Enemies
without hesitation are strong.

01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:00.600
I hated that song,
master.

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:07.570
A song for the Marines who
travel north does not excite me.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.730
You liked that, didn't you?

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:18.130
Yes. This is the best drink.

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:22.620
I also used to drink that
 a lot, imitating you.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.520
I wanted to be a cool man like you.

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:29.650
You came to give a lecture
to a stubborn old man?

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.120
Sorry,
but I won't stop.

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:36.680
Do you intend to die?

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.660
If that happens, there is no problem.

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:43.590
It's to get rid of
 the evil called pirates.

01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:46.960
The Navy can't execute
 the true justice.

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:51.350
I'm sorry, but step aside.

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:55.300
Next time we meet,
 let's drink together.

01:11:56.130 --> 01:12:00.120
Go now, I don't want to kill you.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.670
Neither do I.

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:05.480
Master Zephyr...

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.660
This is a Kairouseki bullet?

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.720
It was on Luffy's shoulder.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:18.790
How long will
you stay here?

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:22.920
A-Aokiji!

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:26.130
You!...

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:29.450
What is Aokiji doing here?

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:32.450
It's alright.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.470
We met a few moments ago.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:41.160
Z is a former Navy Admiral?

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.110
He stole the Dyna
Rocks from the Navy.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:46.360
Dyna Rocks?!

01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:49.540
What is that?

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.310
Those are rocks they say it has a power comparable to the Ancient Weapons.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:56.150
If they receive an impact and are exposed to oxygen, they create a massive explosion.

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:59.110
But due to its massive power,

01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:03.930
it's use is forbidden in civil zones.

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:08.420
The Navy has control of them all.
And now Z stole them?

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:15.390
He wants to use them to destroy the three End Point's of the New World.

01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:18.650
Stop right there!
What are these End Points?

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.150
At the New World sea there are three magma concentrations,

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.500
and they call it End Point.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:29.920
When I heard that from
a Marine, I doubted it...

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.790
Does that really exist?

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:36.420
I can't believe that breasted
lady turned into this dull little girl...

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.240
Are you listening to me?!

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.400
Does the End Point
really exist? Or not?

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.270
They do.

01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:48.650
First, second...

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:55.080
Even when they hear the news about those two islands, all the pirates must be laughing thinking thinking it's nonsense.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:00.000
Many know the legend of the End Points, but no ones believes it.

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:05.620
But the government investigated and declared the legend was false!

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.590
It's because the investigation results were different from what was announced.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:16.540
The government used every possible means to make the world believe it was a lie.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:21.110
Don't you think it would be terrible if pirates showed up wanting to use that?

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:26.090
Only the Government and the Navy superiors know about that.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:33.100
But no one never thought
 a former Admiral would use that.

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.200
That's true.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:39.020
If it was a lie, the Navy
wouldn't be so desperate.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.430
We got involved with a very dangerous man.

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:47.850
Z already destroyed two
 End Points with the Dyna Rocks.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:50.890
If he destroys the last one...

01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:56.170
There will be a chain reaction that connects all three End Points.

01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:57.540
Reaction?

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.860
There will be a major catastrophic eruption, that will burn the entire New World sea!

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:11.020
Every single pirate in the
New World will get burned to death.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.980
But if he does that, he'll also
 involve the innocent people!

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:21.110
Wait a second! He will involve
 civilians... That's just wrong!

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:24.940
Don't you think you're
 thinking too much about yourselves?

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:31.690
How much fear and victims do you think pirates cause in the world? Don't tell me you don't know.

01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:34.090
Z hates all of that...

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:37.510
He hates it so much that
he doesn't care if he dies along.

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:38.520
It doesn't matter!

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.610
I'm going there to get my hat back!
 I'm going to settle things with him!

01:16:44.670 --> 01:16:48.700
Are you crazy, Luffy?
 The New World will be destroyed!

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.650
I promised Shanks.

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:57.250
That I would become a great
pirate and return him that hat.

01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:02.920
If I let that guy take my hat, I won't be able to become the Pirate King.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.930
But you know...
The New World will...

01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:11.260
That won't work with the
 stubbornness of our captain.

01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:13.320
Nami, which way?

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:16.280
Ah, yes. Let's see...

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:24.120
I've already offered my life
to captain Luffy, so I'll follow him.

01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:26.570
Then let's go.

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:32.190
Do we really
need to do that?

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:35.960
Isn't the fate of the New
World too much for us?

01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:38.930
You two want to stay?

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:44.800
What are you saying, you idiot?
When did I said that?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.640
Of course I'm going!
 I'm the brave sea warrior!

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.800
Isn't that right, Chopper?

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:53.840
Yes! Let's go!

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.510
War with that darned man!

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.860
Franky, how much longer?

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.500
It's ready!...
 The repair is finished!

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.370
We can go at any time!

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.540
Super!

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.880
Guys, thank you!

01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:33.110
What are you saying?

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.590
It seems they've decided.

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:46.360
The island where the last End Point is, where Z is... It's this way.

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:49.580
An Eternal Pose?!
Why are you giving this to us?

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:51.610
What do you mean, why?

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:55.090
Without it, you can't go
 to the island where Z is.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.040
Well, that's true, but...

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.790
The Navy is moving,
they also went to the last island.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.010
The Navy too?

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:07.370
As two End Points were already destroyed, the Navy is taking it seriously now.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:11.560
If you loose to Z, you'll be
destroyed along with the New World.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:18.010
Even if you win, you'll be surrounded by the Navy and you'll also be destroyed.

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:23.300
Anyway, I want to
see it until the end.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.380
Our initial objective was returning Nami and the others to normal,

01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:30.910
and now it turned into a battle with the future of the New World at stake.

01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:35.520
Guys, do you remember
 the strongest equipment?

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:43.780
They brought the ships
Z sunk to these docks.

01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:51.660
The old with pity to throw away the things and dreams that others have left behind... And he saved it all.

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.960
So, it's
 great, isn't it?

01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:01.500
Let's bring along the feelings of the pirates
defeated by Z, and attack him with everything!

01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:06.540
I'm counting on you!

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:12.450
Defeat Z, that's trying to
take the sailors freedom!

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.160
Guys!

01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:37.440
When I grow up,
I want to be a hero!

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.340
Which one should I be,
a Navy Admiral or a Pirate?

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.510
Pirates aren't Heroes.

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:45.880
Really?

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.350
They're both
the same to you?

01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:49.680
Yes...

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.180
You guys are cool!

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:01.560
Gari! The best is
 to do what you like!

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:29.320
Keep going in this direction!

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.960
Prepare the frontal cannon!

01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:36.430
Target: Enemy fleet!

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:38.230
Ready...

01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:42.640
Frontal cannon, fire!

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:01.450
I see it! It's the last island!

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.260
They're here!

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.290
Don't let them
 reach Master Z!

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.830
Where the hell is Z?

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.800
Let us pass!

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.080
You go on ahead!

01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:29.150
Take that!

01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:31.750
Usopp 100 Tons Hammer!

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:32.820
Take that!

01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:34.790
I'll leave the
rest with you!

01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:37.260
Leave the rest to me, Usopp!

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:38.990
Guard Point!

01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:42.130
Shooting with full power!

01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:51.060
Z...!

01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:57.480
They got separated...

01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:00.680
But it's an awesome sight...

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.650
Modo, Modo!

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:07.970
I won't let you reach the master!
I'm going to stop you!

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:09.760
I'm glad...

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.690
I have nothing against you, mas this is to return my friends to normal.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.620
I'm fighting with everything I got.

01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:19.900
Indeed, if we fight normally,
 I'm not going to win.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.770
But I'll win him some time.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.770
I don't mind dieing for
Master Z ideals.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.560
Your master ideals, uh...

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:34.450
So you're ready to throw
your lives away for that?

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:38.590
However, I felt hesitation
 in you sword.

01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:41.920
Don't be so sure of
your self, you pirate!

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.810
You lowly pirate!

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.660
You have no right to live!

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.570
Die before Master Z!

01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:04.040
Master... Master... always that,
are you kids, by any chance?

01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:09.050
I'm getting tired.

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:31.140
It started...

01:24:31.770 --> 01:24:40.680
So that the old man doesn't get sad, we're going to kill the Straw Hat's without leaving any of them alive.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.910
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!

01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:49.250
- Don't let him get away!
- Shoot him!

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.890
Take that!

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:21.050
Modo, Modo!

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:37.730
Listen do the requiem
of the other world.

01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:39.400
Soul Solid!

01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:44.770
Mil Fleur!
 Gigantesco Mano! Stomp!

01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:09.060
Take that!

01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:12.030
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!

01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:13.300
Take Javelin!

01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:24.510
I'm going to show you the
 power of my Magical Clima-Tact!

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.280
Heat Ball!

01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:27.780
Cool Ball!

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.950
Thunderbolt Tempo!

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.640
Damn you Nami!
You got us too!

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.480
That was
quite a shock!

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.580
- It was good, wasn't it?
- What was good?

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:03.980
You guys defeated
a lot of them.

01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.020
What about Luffy?

01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:07.120
He went on ahead...

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.020
Then let's go right after him...

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.190
Guys, look!

01:28:12.690 --> 01:28:14.430
Those are the Pacifists!

01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:17.060
But those are different
from the ones we saw before...

01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:24.500
You came, boy.

01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:30.240
The explosion that's going to destroy the last End Point already began.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.710
I didn't come
here for that.

01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:35.880
I'm only here to
get my straw hat back!

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.190
This hat?...
What does it mean to you?

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.860
It's what shows me the path.

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:44.720
The path to become the Pirate King.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:56.700
I wont allow pirates to have dreams!
 And I'll destroy the sea you keep sailing!

01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:05.550
Remember this...

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:09.550
The name of whom will
destroy evil... my name is Z!

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.100
That's useless!

01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:26.770
Did you stopped thinking
and came here just to attack me?

01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:38.780
Not good!

01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:48.960
Sorry it took so long, guys!

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.290
Let's go, partner!

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.260
It's here!

01:29:57.230 --> 01:29:59.470
Iron Pirate!

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:04.270
General Franky!

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.850
Awesome!

01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:22.320
Franky Radical Beam!

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.000
That's so cool!

01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:41.880
Mosa, Mosa!

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.480
Sky Walk!

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.020
Diable Jumble!

01:30:55.090 --> 01:30:56.090
Take this!

01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:15.780
Santoryu!

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.010
Seiryuuin!

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.880
Ryuusui!

01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:30.760
If you're not sure,
 cut them your self.

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:34.530
I prefer the sexy Nami!

01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:37.800
Burn, sexy fire!

01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:42.640
Take this!
Meteor attack of love!

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.610
You can fall in love, Nami.

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:34.050
I'm back!

01:32:34.050 --> 01:32:35.790
I also came back to normal!

01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:37.660
- Really?

01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.560
It's really great! The 90 years!

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.560
Zoro and the other did it!

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.600
Now there is only Z left!
Let's join Luffy!

01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:56.020
It's useless!

01:32:56.110 --> 01:32:59.610
You can't destroy my justice!

01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:03.520
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!

01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:07.820
Gatling!

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.330
Even being a
pirate, you have courage.

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.730
Much better than that wimpy Navy!

01:33:19.730 --> 01:33:21.000
But...!

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.570
Gear Third!

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:26.470
Gigant Pistol!

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.420
I am... Z!

01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:42.220
Z!...

01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:45.990
Smash Buster!

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.750
Luffy.

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.400
Boy...

01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.400
Why do you want to
 face me so much?

01:34:27.330 --> 01:34:32.410
Even if you defeat me,
in the end, you're still a pirate.

01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:36.640
Nobody from the
society will thank you.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.450
And so what?

01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:42.680
I'll do what I want!

01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:47.820
If I'm not able to defeat you, I also won't be able to become the Pirate King.

01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:50.690
Is that so?

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:54.630
You sound like a kid.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.820
You'll do what you want?

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.820
If that's the case,
I'll do the same.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:27.460
I'll dedicate my entire life
to end with your ambition!

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:32.000
Come at me! This is the final battle!

01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:51.080
Black Fist Zephyr... has returned!

01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:57.380
I will do it!

01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:04.760
I will become the Pirate King!

01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:11.560
My name is... Z!

01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:17.670
You bastard!

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:06.550
I got old...

01:38:07.150 --> 01:38:11.460
With only that and my body
doesn't want to move anymore...

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.530
What a shame...

01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:18.370
That fun moment
ended so quickly...

01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:24.800
Frankly, that battle ended
 right on time, what a close call.

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.140
Luffy!

01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:44.220
Those who follow their dreams, destroy everything and move on.

01:38:45.230 --> 01:38:49.160
Take your straw
 hat and my life.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.270
I don't want your life.

01:38:54.970 --> 01:38:56.500
I'm already satisfied.

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.570
If you want to
 continue, I don't mind.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.910
No.

01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:06.680
I'm also satisfied.

01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:09.020
Luffy!

01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:15.390
Are you okey, Luffy?

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.760
Guys!...

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.430
"Guys", nothing!

01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:20.360
You went on ahead again!

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:22.800
Master Z!

01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:27.700
Ain... Binz...

01:39:31.810 --> 01:39:36.580
Forgive me... for giving
you so much work...

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:40.280
Me... Me...

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.320
I'm happy to
see that you're alright.

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:48.120
It seems everyone is gathered here.

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.160
Kizaru...!

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:55.930
It's a shame that the Straw Hat and Master Zephyr are almost dead.

01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:59.930
But seeing you're all going
to die anyway, it's the same.

01:40:00.330 --> 01:40:02.840
Damn it,
just at time like this...

01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:07.170
You brought them all...

01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:13.980
At the end, I did what I wanted.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.550
Now I have to pay
the price for doing what I wanted.

01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:21.520
Or I wouldn't be able
 to face the ones that went before me.

01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:24.720
Straw Hat Luffy.

01:40:25.190 --> 01:40:28.160
You have your own adventure, don't you?

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.860
Leave the rest with me, Z!

01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:33.070
Old man!

01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:35.900
No, Master!

01:40:43.730 --> 01:40:48.980
Kuzan! You made a place
where I'd be able to die?

01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:55.420
Master! Master! Master...

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.590
Master...

01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:19.850
Yasakani no Magatama!

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.420
Borsalino!

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:28.390
Good bye, master Zephyr!

01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:56.950
I'll give you
 guys your last training!

01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:52.370
Don't cry!

01:42:55.870 --> 01:43:00.640
He ended his life as he wanted to.

01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:05.850
Don't you think he's incredible?

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.040
We're going to remember this!

01:43:31.410 --> 01:43:33.150
Come at me when you want!

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.380
I'm the hero of justice, my name is...

01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:41.390
Z!...
