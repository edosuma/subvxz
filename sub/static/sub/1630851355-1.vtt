00:33.324 --> 00:35.618
MACGREGOR: All legends are born in truth.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.912
From the Amazon

00:37.996 --> 00:40.415
came the legend of the Tears of the Moon.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.252
A single petal from the great Tree

00:44.335 --> 00:47.547
could cure any illness
and break any curse.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.760
Over the centuries,

00:51.926 --> 00:53.762
many expeditions went searching

00:53.845 --> 00:56.056
for the Healing Tears of legend.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.893
None more famous

00:59.976 --> 01:03.021
than that of the conquistador
Don Lope de Aguirre,

01:04.647 --> 01:08.359
who was determined to possess
the Tears' power.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.404
But the jungle protected the Tears.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.620
History will tell you
his journey ended in failure.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.748
But legend tells more.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.293
That he was found
by the Guardians of the Tree

01:25.376 --> 01:26.753
and nursed back to life.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.798
That he demanded they give him
the sacred Arrowhead,

01:29.964 --> 01:32.592
the key to finding the Tears of the Moon.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.179
That Aguirre attacked.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.100
But the jungle defended,

01:40.225 --> 01:42.644
and Aguirre and his conquistadors
were taken,

01:42.811 --> 01:45.980
cursed, never to leave sight
of the river again,

01:46.147 --> 01:48.483
-unable to leave or die...
-

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777
...or so the legend goes.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.113
"We know they disappeared here,

01:53.196 --> 01:55.115
"in the region of Lágrimas de Cristal,

01:55.281 --> 01:59.786
"and it is here that we will find
the true source of the legend,

01:59.869 --> 02:03.456
"a tree that possesses
unparalleled healing powers.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.083
-"My esteemed colleagues..."
-

02:05.166 --> 02:07.127
"...I assert that the famous legend

02:07.293 --> 02:09.629
"of the Tears of the Moon is not a myth

02:09.963 --> 02:11.840
-"but scientific truth."
-...but scientific truth.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.968
"One that could revolutionize
modern medicine,

02:15.093 --> 02:17.512
"curing illnesses
that not only scourge our cities,

02:17.679 --> 02:21.683
"but cut down more of our soldiers
in the trenches than German bullets.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.854
"I have come here today to request access
to your exclusive archives..."

02:25.937 --> 02:28.773
-"...including an ancient Arrowhead

02:28.940 --> 02:32.944
"recently recovered from
the lost expedition of Dr. Albert Falls.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.071
"The Arrowhead represents
the missing piece

02:35.238 --> 02:37.157
"that will finally unlock the location

02:37.240 --> 02:39.784
"of, pause for dramatic effect, the..."

02:41.953 --> 02:43.872
"The Tears of the Moon."

02:44.038 --> 02:46.040
And you made your request, Mr. Houghton,

02:46.207 --> 02:48.960
and the answer remains, emphatically,

02:49.085 --> 02:51.296
-"no."
-MEN: Hear, hear.

02:51.796 --> 02:56.467
SIR JAMES: Our archives
are the providence of legitimate scholars,

02:56.551 --> 02:59.637
-not inspired amateurs.
-MEN: Hear, hear.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.391
Be that as it may,
since I have your attention,

03:03.600 --> 03:06.811
would you at least allow me
to, uh, continue with my, uh,

03:07.770 --> 03:09.731
examination of how important

03:09.814 --> 03:12.525
the Tears of the Moon could be
to medicine?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.369
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.038
-Shaka Zulu.
-Yes.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.790
Through one simple act of innovation,

03:27.916 --> 03:29.918
he came to dominate
all his enemies from the...

03:30.001 --> 03:32.545
There was that,
but also the encirclement tactic.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.215
You are not where you ought to be.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.217
Yes. You're right. Uh, I think I...

03:37.300 --> 03:40.511
The secretaries' gallery is that way.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.971
Thank you so much.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.350
MACGREGOR: A cure for all ailments,

03:45.808 --> 03:48.228
whether it be consumption,

03:48.686 --> 03:51.231
diphtheria, dengue fever,

03:51.648 --> 03:55.151
yellow fever, hay fever,
fever fever...

03:55.276 --> 03:57.654
All fevers, um, would be covered.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.662
Excuse me.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.163
Yes?

04:07.413 --> 04:09.666
This area is for Society members only.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.917
-Is it?
-Yes.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.460
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.671
Well, to be quite frank,
I've no idea how you even...

04:26.349 --> 04:28.935
SIR JAMES: Mr. Houghton,
we granted you an audience

04:29.018 --> 04:31.646
in deference to your late father.

04:31.771 --> 04:35.441
This, however,
seems remarkably like a paper

04:35.608 --> 04:41.781
I had the honor of refusing
when it was submitted by a female writer,

04:42.240 --> 04:45.159
a Dr. Lily Houghton.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.372
No relation, I take it?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.332
None that I've ever agreed to.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.210
SIR JAMES: Shall we help you
find your way out?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.077
It's in the first crate of the lot.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.705
And thank you so much
for your very generous contribution,

06:12.872 --> 06:15.249
in solid gold bars, I might add.

06:15.416 --> 06:19.921
Would make life so much simpler
if more people paid in gold.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.174
I don't want the whole lot,
just one thing.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.513
Seems someone got to it before me.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.891
SIR JAMES: Um, they shouldn't have.
I'm sure it's all there.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.476
It must have just slid somewhere.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.353
Let's... Let's see.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.188
It was definitely there.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.192
-Stop her!
-Oh!

06:41.651 --> 06:45.655
Hello. I just wanted you to know,
this is a Nguni assegai.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.532
It's been mislabeled as "Zulu."

06:49.117 --> 06:50.451
SIR JAMES: Grab her!

06:56.749 --> 06:57.750
Oh.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.179
Wait!

07:16.936 --> 07:19.355
SIR JAMES: The end of the line. Get down!

07:26.571 --> 07:27.655
-Oh, my God!
-No, no, no!

07:34.954 --> 07:35.955
MAN: Good day, sir!

07:36.038 --> 07:37.832
MACGREGOR: You think
you're the first to eject me?

07:37.915 --> 07:40.209
I have been turned out
of some of the best clubs in Europe!

07:50.803 --> 07:51.929
-Oh, my gosh!

07:54.474 --> 07:57.351
Fräulein, give me that box
and I will help you up.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.606
-MACGREGOR: Stop! Stop!
-You are slipping!

08:07.278 --> 08:08.988
-

08:14.118 --> 08:15.328
CONDUCTOR: Fare, please.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.498
MACGREGOR: Can I put it on a tab?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.000
You shipping out, lads?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.677
I think I speak for the entire Society

08:31.844 --> 08:35.681
when I offer my most sincere apologies

08:35.765 --> 08:37.975
to you, Prince Joachim.

08:38.893 --> 08:42.104
You just told them my name.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.189
Oh.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.527
Oh.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.083
It is Prince
"Joachim."

09:02.333 --> 09:03.501
Joachim.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.545
-Good.
-Now, Prince Joachim,

09:05.711 --> 09:07.213
we could refund your money from the...

09:07.296 --> 09:10.591
You keep that money, and you tell me,

09:11.008 --> 09:13.302
who is that woman?

09:13.636 --> 09:14.929
I don't...

09:17.890 --> 09:19.892
I do know who that was.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.478
MACGREGOR: Breaking and entering,
grand larceny,

09:22.562 --> 09:25.481
and worst of all,
forced to take public transport.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.192
Should I be concerned about you?

09:28.359 --> 09:29.694
Why would you say that, MacGregor?

09:29.986 --> 09:33.990
This is a petal that could heal all,
save countless lives, change the world.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.450
Haven't you been dreaming
about another adventure?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.119
If I wanted to go to a primitive backwater

09:38.202 --> 09:39.829
where I can't understand
a word anyone's saying,

09:39.912 --> 09:41.539
I'd visit our relatives in Scotland.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.584
Barely got over that hideous trip
with Father to Bhutan.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.460
You only lost two toes.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.838
-I was seven.
-LILY: Then just stay here.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.381
You can. You can just stay here.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.508
Don't worry about me.
All alone, in the Amazon.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.926
But who'd look after you?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.928
Well, I have no idea.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.639
Come on, cheer up.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.391
Steamer to Brazil, rail to Porto Velho...

10:01.559 --> 10:02.893
...then all we need is a skipper.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.124
SKIPPER: First of all,
let me congratulate you

10:25.207 --> 10:26.876
on your excellent choice of skipper.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.545
Of all the jungle cruises
you could take in the Amazon,

10:29.712 --> 10:31.339
this one is undoubtedly

10:31.505 --> 10:32.506
the cheapest.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.175
But also the most thrilling.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.927
-Are you still giving a tour?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.179
SKIPPER: Yes, I am.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.222
-Perhaps a refund?
-SKIPPER: No refunds.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.183
We should've taken the other cruise,
honey. Told you.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.684
-

10:56.781 --> 10:58.032
Skipper!

10:59.575 --> 11:00.785
Skipper?

11:02.036 --> 11:04.997
Skipper! I think you should see this!

11:09.502 --> 11:11.212
Heads up! Coming through!

11:17.677 --> 11:19.428
-Where were we?
-About to die.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.513
Ah.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.057
MAN: Skipper!

11:25.476 --> 11:26.477
Sir?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.646
Sometimes these buttons get stuck.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.273
Skipper!

11:31.857 --> 11:32.858
All right.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.457
If you look to the left of the boat,
you'll see some very playful toucans.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.626
They're playing
their favorite game of beak-wrestling.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.002
The only drawback is,

11:52.962 --> 11:54.588
only two can play.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.844
There's two birds, and those are toucans.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.304
I'm saying that only "two can" play.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.473
Not one, but "two can" play.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.100
Wow.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.185
The rocks you see here
in the river are sandstone.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.689
But some people
just take them for granite.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.234
It's one of my boulder attractions.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.613
You know, before this,
I used to work in an orange juice factory,

12:19.697 --> 12:20.906
but I got canned.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.992
-ALL: Oh...
-Couldn't concentrate.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.285
ALL: Oh...

12:24.368 --> 12:25.619
Yeah, they put the squeeze on me, too.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.165
That's a good one.
I should've opened with that one.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.751
You know, they say
the boa constrictor right there is capable

12:31.834 --> 12:34.253
of eating up to 500 pounds per sitting.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.590
Personally, I find that very hard...

12:37.757 --> 12:38.883
to swallow.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.092
Mommy, can you please make him stop?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.511
No one can.
And don't interrupt me like that again.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.763
I will feed you to the boa.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.972
She is a small child.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.223
He loves small children.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.767
Close your mouth.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.690
SKIPPER: Hey! Hey!

12:54.857 --> 12:57.234
Hands in the boat!
Know this about the jungle,

12:57.401 --> 12:59.695
everything that you see wants to kill you.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.072
And can.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.912
Poison angel's trumpet.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.914
Strychnos. Curare. Banana spider.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.962
Marauders, dead of fever,
for never finding the Fountain of Youth.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.175
Adventurers, stung by stingrays,
searching for cities of gold.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.970
Conquistadors, cursed,
for slaughtering innocent natives.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.182
And then there's the ones
that just got eaten

13:28.265 --> 13:30.017
by the deadly hippopotamus.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.894
But hippos aren't native to the...

13:31.977 --> 13:33.020
Shh.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.064
Look out!

13:40.861 --> 13:44.573
This is the highlight of the tour.
It's my favorite part of the jungle.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.412
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready

13:50.496 --> 13:52.373
for the eighth Wonder of the World.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.918
Wait for it...

13:58.963 --> 14:01.465
The backside of water!

14:04.260 --> 14:05.886
It looks just like the front side.

14:05.970 --> 14:06.971
It's completely different.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.639
It's the eighth Wonder of the World,
the backside of water.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.225
Guys, get your cameras out, come on.
You don't wanna miss this.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.977
-Snap, snap, snap.
-

14:13.060 --> 14:14.478
Keep snapping.

14:15.729 --> 14:19.024
I hope those aren't the Puka Michuna,
the deadliest hunters in the hemisphere.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.276
They hunt humans!

14:26.031 --> 14:27.032
Come on.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.786
Please, go faster.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.748
Oh, any faster would damage my engine,
and I can't afford a new one.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.877
Grazie.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.961
Prego.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.922
All right, listen up, I get paid
by the number of people I take out,

14:42.006 --> 14:44.758
not by the number of people
I bring back. Hold on!

15:29.470 --> 15:31.972
Ah. Be a good chap and, uh,
take care of the luggage.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.147
Told you not to wear trousers.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.608
Drawing unnecessary attention.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.151
I don't care in the slightest.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.365
LILY: Hello.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.543
SKIPPER: Well, folks,
you were all outstanding today,

16:01.627 --> 16:04.338
now I need you all out,
standing on the dock.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.049
That means "get off my boat."
I'm only serious.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.133
Au revoir.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.218
SKIPPER: Ma'am, don't forget

16:09.301 --> 16:10.386
-to collect your baggage.
-Thank you.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.804
I'm only kidding. He's behind you.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.431
Adiós.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.225
Make sure you take care of Zaqueu,
he's a good kid.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.144
He looks 10, but he's secretly 47.
Thank you, sir.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.232
Look, how stunning. Did you make these?

16:23.565 --> 16:24.817
Beautiful.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.988
Oh, that is awful.
Excuse me, I just think that you...

16:29.071 --> 16:30.656
Let's not start a fight
with a monkey vendor.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.200
I'm not going to start a fight.
They clearly shouldn't be in cages.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.494
Oh, my gosh! Look, there's the boats!
Look, look, look!

16:38.372 --> 16:41.000
Right. I think we've earned ourselves
some nice lunch at the hotel,

16:41.083 --> 16:42.626
then a bath and a cocktail.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.129
We did not travel half the globe
for baths and cocktails.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.173
We must find this Mr. Nilo
and secure our travel. Come on!

16:50.217 --> 16:52.136
Frank owes me money.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.723
Buongiorno, Frankie boy!

16:55.889 --> 16:57.224
Please don't call me that.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.309
Hey, Frankie, you know what today is?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.436
COCKATOO: Frank owes me money.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.479
It's the third Tuesday of the month.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.565
My money, Frank. My contante.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.649
Where is it?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.484
Oh, you mean this money? It's all here.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.070
I just need this,
so I can finally eat this week.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.947
The rest è per te.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.910
You insult me, Frank.
This is not all of my money.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.747
This is like a little pinky toe,
nothing...

17:19.830 --> 17:22.416
Itty-bitty, little nothing
of my money, Frank.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.627
You borrow money from me
to get a new engine,

17:25.794 --> 17:28.297
well, you got to pay me back,
plus interest.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.924
Yeah, I'm going to keep
your engine for now.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.802
I get 5,000 real in one week,
then you get it back.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.557
I don't get my money in one week,
then I keep your whole boat.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.892
FRANK: What do you want my boat for?

17:39.975 --> 17:41.727
You have nice boats.
You have all the boats.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.646
Not yet, I don't, Frank.
But I bet you I will.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.940
I'm gonna guess, by next week.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.776
Arrivederci, Franco.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.873
Ugh, what fresh hell is this?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.333
Oh, I love it!

18:06.376 --> 18:07.377
Excuse me, um,

18:07.461 --> 18:08.629
-do you know Mr. Nilo...
-

18:11.173 --> 18:12.758
Classy clientele.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.302
Home again, Rosita.

18:15.385 --> 18:18.430
-Mmm.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.423
Hey!

18:54.424 --> 18:56.176
Perhaps I should search
for Mr. Nilo elsewhere.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.886
There's always a chance
he's at the hotel bar.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.097
Fine. But be quick about it
or I'll leave without you.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.016
Oh, that option is becoming
increasingly desirable.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.643
Excuse me.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.770
Um, Mr. Nilo's office?

19:07.896 --> 19:09.857
Upstairs. Thank you. Obri... Obrigada.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.739
How you doing?

19:26.748 --> 19:28.333
-

19:30.419 --> 19:31.712
LILY: Mr. Nilo? Hello?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.046
Frank owes me money.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.967
Ah, there you are. I was hoping
we might have a small business chat.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.510
FRANK: Not a good chat time right now.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.221
But if you came back
first thing tomorrow morning,

19:41.305 --> 19:42.389
lots of available chat then.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.016
No, I would much prefer now.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.934
My name is Dr. Lily Houghton,

19:46.101 --> 19:47.936
and my brother and I
are looking for passage upriver,

19:48.020 --> 19:49.521
and I'm told that you are
the man for the job.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.316
-You were told wrong.
-That's impossible, because you come...

19:52.399 --> 19:53.859
-...highly recommended.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.694
I have an idea. Please go away.

19:55.777 --> 19:59.072
Mr. Nilo, your name is plastered
all over the boats outside.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.909
I think you're being a bit unreasonable.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.952
You're the one trying
to break down my door.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.790
I have a lot of money.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.083
Oh.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.882
-You're insistent.
-It's been said.

20:20.052 --> 20:24.556
Now, we're headed upriver,
in the direction of the Peruvian Andes.

20:24.723 --> 20:28.060
This region doesn't really have a name
on the conventional map,

20:28.143 --> 20:30.938
but it was once known to some

20:31.104 --> 20:33.023
as Lágrimas de Cristal.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.359
You're wearing pants.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.654
Trousers. And yes, as are you.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.197
Do women in England do that now?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.032
Well, we're not in England,
last time I checked.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.660
Now, look, as shocking
as the pants are, I'd really...

20:44.743 --> 20:46.036
ROSITA: Frank owes me money.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.412
Frank owes me money.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.540
Frank owes me money.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.167
-Can I get you a drink?
-Who's Frank?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.461
FRANK: I have no idea.
LILY: I will have a little something.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.630
-Spritzer, I assume?
-I'll have whatever you're having.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.340
So, do you know the region, Mr. Nilo?

20:58.423 --> 21:00.467
Well, if it's on the Amazon River,
I know it.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.551
And, lady, I could tell you,

21:01.635 --> 21:02.970
of all the places in the world you can go,

21:03.053 --> 21:06.598
the last place you wanna go
is Lágrimas de Cristal.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.350
Oh, but I do. And I will.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.602
Oh, but you won't, Pants.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.479
You can't get there. Nobody can get there.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.107
And if they could, they wouldn't.
It's not a fun vacation.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.109
Well, I'm not here for a vacation.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.450
Where'd you get the map?

21:25.534 --> 21:29.329
Isn't it extraordinary?
The detail and the care he took.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.373
It was drawn by Aguirre's cartographer.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.333
And it belonged to my father,
who used to tell me

21:33.417 --> 21:36.336
all about the Tears of the Moon
when I was a little girl.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.382
So, that's why you wanna go?
Your daddy's bedtime stories?

21:40.465 --> 21:41.925
Look, can you get us there or not?

21:42.009 --> 21:44.052
Or has this just been
a colossal waste of my time?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.220
I could get you there,

21:45.304 --> 21:47.389
but you have to consider the dengue fever,

21:47.472 --> 21:48.557
anaconda, plus,

21:48.640 --> 21:50.892
look, lady, that's the home
of the actual Puka Michuna.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.770
They're the ones that like to eat you
and wear your eyes for beads.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.773
Look, lady, I gotta be honest with you,
let's do something that's safe.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.483
So, me, you, and your pants,

21:58.567 --> 22:00.444
we can go for a ride around town.
That'd be fun.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.904
I'll show you some waterfalls.
You look like you like waterfalls.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.156
-And I'll also show you

22:04.239 --> 22:06.199
the herd of pygmy elephants we just found.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.534
Let's go see some elephants.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.332
-I lost my key for that thing.
-LILY: Did you?

22:13.665 --> 22:14.833
FRANK: I did.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.211
Well, that's never gonna do it.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.005
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Those are very sharp.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.549
Mr. Nilo, I spent my childhood playtime

22:22.632 --> 22:25.302
with the toddler pickpockets
of Delhi, so...

22:25.510 --> 22:26.511
There we go.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.222
Allow me to manage my own safety,
if that's all right.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.766
Now, shall we negotiate a price?

22:30.849 --> 22:33.477
Or shall I just cast about
for another skipper?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.317
Who's paying for all this?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.110
Oh, Mr. Nilo insisted it was his treat.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.320
That's right.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.906
I consider 5,000 real more than adequate.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.825
10,000, I take you there myself.
I am my best captain.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.203
Oh, and your most modest.
Fine, 10,000.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.746
10,000 to bring you there alive.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.123
If I have to bring you back dead,
it's 15,000.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.625
Why should I pay more dead?

22:56.792 --> 22:59.711
Dead, I'd have to carry you.
Dead's a lot harder, lady.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.005
20, dead or alive.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.590
Okay, but I get paid in full

23:03.673 --> 23:06.009
when we turn back
before Lágrimas de Cristal.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.552
Why ever would we be turning back?

23:07.719 --> 23:10.639
Well, you're gonna beg me to turn back,
first sign of the rapids.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.808
Well, I look forward to disappointing you.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.310
MACGREGOR: Lily,
look who I found at the hotel bar.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.395
NILO: Ah!
MACGREGOR: Mr. Nilo.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.313
Buongiorno, signorina.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.899
MACGREGOR: He drives a hard bargain,
but he met his match with me.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.360
Negotiated him down to 50,000.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.195
Who's your friend?

23:26.863 --> 23:27.864
Not Mr. Nilo.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.741
-Not Mr. Nilo, no.
-LILY: No.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.077
So, I suppose that would make you...

23:32.244 --> 23:33.537
Enjoying your meal, Frank?

23:33.703 --> 23:35.622
As in, "Frank owes me money," Frank?

23:36.957 --> 23:39.292
Of course. It's all making perfect sense.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.462
I suppose it's only a scam
if you fall for it.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.674
Well, thank you, Mr. Frank.
I hope we never meet again.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.008
Mr. Nilo, hello.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.388
-Did you just whistle at me?
-12,000.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.472
Eh, scusa.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.558
-10,000.
-Aren't you missing an engine?

23:54.641 --> 23:57.227
Signorina, he could not get you
as far as the outhouse.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.438
In fact, his boat kind of
looks like an outhouse.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.815
You're never gonna find a faster boat
in the harbor than La Quila.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.276
Plus, she has the finest bath
in all Brazil.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.861
Why should I trust you?

24:06.570 --> 24:07.904
I'm the only one that could get you there.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.117
-

24:19.458 --> 24:20.584
Oh, my gosh!

24:24.004 --> 24:25.755
Careful. They can smell fear.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.048
I am not afraid.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.302
Might be me. Warm, liquid fear.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.274
Shoo.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.943
-

24:47.986 --> 24:49.613
NILO: Everybody stay calm!

24:57.037 --> 24:58.914
-A little bit more fear just came out.
-Shut up!

25:02.125 --> 25:03.752
-

25:12.761 --> 25:13.845
Ouch.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.204
MAN: He did it!

25:42.457 --> 25:44.376
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.753
Frank Wolff. Jungle Navigation.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.839
Best rates in town,
completely jaguar-free.

25:54.052 --> 25:57.055
You are a lot of things
that I don't really care for.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.225
But you are capable, so,

26:00.392 --> 26:01.476
12,000.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.602
-15,000.
-12,000.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.646
-15...
-Nuh!

26:04.729 --> 26:08.191
12. Half now, half upon return, alive,

26:08.733 --> 26:11.027
and if we have a deal, I'll meet you
at the docks with our luggage.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.112
FRANK: We have a deal.
LILY: Good.

26:12.195 --> 26:13.655
La Quila will be ready
first thing in the morning.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.824
Oh, no, "Frank owes me money,"
we're gonna depart in 10 minutes.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.701
No, it gets dark in two hours.

26:17.784 --> 26:18.785
Does it?

26:19.703 --> 26:21.037
We should probably leave in 10 minutes.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.373
Good decision.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.052
Not now.

26:37.679 --> 26:38.888
I said, not now.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.108
Come here.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.944
You did good, Proxima. You're a good girl.

26:53.111 --> 26:56.281
You were a little late,
and you bit me way too hard.

26:57.741 --> 26:58.742
But you did good.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.512
Jungle doesn't care
how pretty your dresses are,

27:19.596 --> 27:21.431
you're never gonna get
all your luggage on my boat.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.557
Not mine.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.729
Mine. And, I assure you,

27:27.812 --> 27:30.857
every one of these items
is entirely necessary for my survival.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.528
Well, with all this extra added weight,

27:35.612 --> 27:37.906
we'd be lucky to even
get out of the harbor, so, no.

27:37.989 --> 27:41.534
Dinner without a dinner jacket
is hardly, well, dinner, is it?

27:41.618 --> 27:42.619
Now...

27:43.953 --> 27:45.455
be a good chap.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.382
What're you gonna do with those birds?

27:55.465 --> 27:57.258
We're gonna stuff them
and send them to Paris.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.426
No, you're not.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.936
What on Earth do you think you're doing?

28:10.939 --> 28:12.774
LILY: Hey!
MacGregor!

28:12.941 --> 28:14.901
That will need to be
retrieved immediately.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.569
-LILY: Help, MacGregor!
-

28:17.487 --> 28:18.613
MacGregor!

28:18.780 --> 28:19.781
No.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.492
Those are my tennis rackets.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.576
It's a river cruise.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.747
-Assorted day wear and shoes?
-No.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.667
Light reading and bathing costumes?

28:30.750 --> 28:31.751
Good.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.963
-The liquor?
-That one can stay.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.132
Now, listen here, you buffoon,

28:37.298 --> 28:39.259
if you scuttle any more
of my luggage, I will...

28:40.051 --> 28:41.553
Gosh, there's a lot of you, isn't there?

28:41.886 --> 28:43.430
-Yeah, there is.
-Lily?

28:44.806 --> 28:45.807
Lily?

28:46.433 --> 28:48.226
-

28:50.395 --> 28:51.730
MAN: Hey!

28:51.896 --> 28:53.815
-Nilo! He's got your engine!
-Oh, we gotta go.

28:53.898 --> 28:54.941
Not without my sister.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.317
FRANK: Come on. Get your stuff. Let's go.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.455
FRANK: Lady!

29:12.250 --> 29:13.251
Let's go.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.963
I am not leaving without my toiletries.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.174
MAN: Shut down that engine!

29:19.799 --> 29:20.967
MACGREGOR: Okay, time to leave.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.473
Why are they chasing us?

29:26.639 --> 29:28.016
I have no idea.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.059
Here's the English woman. Pay up.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.689
-

29:37.567 --> 29:38.568
MACGREGOR: Lily.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.528
Turn starboard. Resume heading.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.572
MACGREGOR: What?
I don't know what that means.

30:01.424 --> 30:02.425
Lady, look, we gotta...

30:02.509 --> 30:03.802
Oh, God, sorry, Frank.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.136
It's all right. Strong form.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.518
LILY: Frank, follow me.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.229
FRANK: Don't go up there. It's that way.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.692
Lady, it's that way.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.000
-

30:39.921 --> 30:42.423
FRANK: Lady! Leave the monkeys.
The monkeys are fine.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.175
Don't go up there.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.970
-

30:56.563 --> 30:58.565
-Lady, stop!
-Not now, Frank!

31:11.703 --> 31:12.829
How you doing, Pants?

31:12.996 --> 31:14.289
I'm good.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.456
You know, I was trying
to tell you about the...

31:15.623 --> 31:17.375
-I know.
-Come on.

31:24.465 --> 31:25.800
No.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.760
Come on! Lady, jump!

31:28.344 --> 31:30.096
What are you waiting for?

31:30.263 --> 31:31.514
MAN: There they are!

31:35.018 --> 31:36.561
-

31:48.531 --> 31:50.450
-Where's Lily?
-There.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.745
Of course she is.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.804
Okay. Come on, lady.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.485
-

32:31.741 --> 32:33.868
Tucking in a spot of sightseeing?

32:35.995 --> 32:37.205
How nice of you to join us.

32:38.247 --> 32:39.374
Why didn't you jump in the water?

32:39.457 --> 32:41.417
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-She can't swim.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.419
You booked a river cruise
and you can't swim?

32:43.503 --> 32:44.504
I have no intention of swimming.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.339
And what about the 20 guys
chasing us around town?

32:46.422 --> 32:49.717
I may or may not have
something in my possession that

32:50.301 --> 32:53.096
may or may not be of interest
to other interested parties.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.477
-Shh!

33:06.317 --> 33:10.905
I assume she escaped your grasp, Axel.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.949
Yes, your excellency.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.619
Then I'll take care of it myself.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.790
The Tree is the key to
Germany winning this war.

33:27.296 --> 33:31.217
The Arrowhead will show us the way
to the Tree.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.803
We cannot let it leave this harbor.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.013
Surface!

33:48.985 --> 33:51.154
-Who are those guys?
-Oh, my gosh.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.033
The price just went up.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.092
- Come on!

34:14.052 --> 34:15.720
-What happened?
-We lost all power.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.059
Reload!

34:23.978 --> 34:24.979
I need you to take the wheel.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.397
No, no, no. I am an excellent driver.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.607
Anyone but you.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.067
-Starboard.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.151
-Quick, before he reloads.
-You missed...

34:30.234 --> 34:31.277
Understood.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.822
-It's all yours.
-Oh, thank God!

34:55.051 --> 34:56.344
You steal my engine?

34:56.427 --> 34:57.887
Get off my dock!

34:58.054 --> 34:59.806
It's private property, Frank.
You're finished.

34:59.889 --> 35:00.890
Ciao.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.183
-

35:12.235 --> 35:13.945
JOACHIM: Sink them
and we can recover the Arrowhead

35:14.028 --> 35:15.321
from the bottom of the river!

35:16.614 --> 35:17.865
Load torpedoes.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.035
MAN: Load torpedoes!
MAN 2: Torpedo in. Closing the hatch!

35:22.995 --> 35:24.413
-Thank you.
-Oh, you're welcome.

35:26.582 --> 35:28.584
JOACHIM: Closer. Closer.

35:31.838 --> 35:32.839
MACGREGOR: Lily?
LILY: Do you know,

35:32.922 --> 35:34.298
-if I were you, Frank...
-Well, you're not me.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.675
I just feel that sometimes
it just needs a bit of a...

35:35.758 --> 35:37.593
This is my engine.
Nobody touches my engine but me.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.389
-What did I just...

35:44.725 --> 35:45.893
LILY: There you go.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.189
JOACHIM: Goodbye.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.191
-

35:53.442 --> 35:54.443
MACGREGOR: Is that a...

35:54.527 --> 35:56.028
-Torpedo.
-LILY: Oh, my God.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.202
Frank, Frank, Frank!

36:03.369 --> 36:04.704
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank!

36:04.787 --> 36:06.914
-What are you doing?
-FRANK: We can't outrun it.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.453
Frank!

36:53.586 --> 36:54.587
Oh.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.441
FRANK: Look what they did to you.
Poor thing.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.779
I'm so sorry. Machine guns.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.989
Who brings a submarine to the Amazon?

37:23.699 --> 37:26.035
But you still outran them. Every time.

37:40.174 --> 37:42.093
I thought I'd keep it casual.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.512
Well, you've really
outdone yourself this time.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.723
Do we know the identity
of our homicidal maniac in the submarine?

37:47.807 --> 37:49.183
No, I don't know his name.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.977
But the youngest son of Kaiser Wilhelm

37:51.060 --> 37:53.145
wrote several articles
about the Tears of the Moon.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.481
And if I had to guess,
I would say that that's him.

37:57.483 --> 37:58.734
Aren't you hot in all that?

37:59.193 --> 38:00.611
Not in the slightest.

38:03.155 --> 38:04.907
My eyeballs are sweating.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.663
LILY: Are you all right, love?

38:19.130 --> 38:21.757
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness!
MacGregor, look!

38:21.924 --> 38:24.051
Inia geoffrensis!

38:31.017 --> 38:33.269
You know, here we call them "encantado."

38:33.436 --> 38:35.438
-"Bewitched"?
-Yeah. Shape-shifter spirits.

38:35.604 --> 38:38.399
Don't look them directly in the eye
unless you want nightmares for life.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.319
You believe in legends,
you should believe in curses, too.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.114
Okay.

38:52.538 --> 38:53.581
Hey, MacGregor.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.959
Had a girlfriend once, she was cross-eyed.
Didn't work out.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.502
We could never see eye to eye.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.962
-

39:00.046 --> 39:02.214
LILY: Oh, my God.
Is that your idea of a joke?

39:02.298 --> 39:03.424
That is not funny.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.760
I'm also quite sure
she was seeing somebody on the side.

39:13.893 --> 39:14.935
Silly.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.741
You know, most people smile
when they're on camera, Frank.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.204
It's a moving picture camera.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.455
Have you never seen one before?

39:34.538 --> 39:35.748
I've never seen a moving picture.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.083
They're so much fun

39:37.166 --> 39:39.668
and you can experience
being anywhere in the world.

39:39.752 --> 39:40.920
Ah.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.171
Although, why would you want to,

39:42.254 --> 39:44.006
if you could be here,
surrounded by all this?

39:44.090 --> 39:45.091
It's just...

39:45.174 --> 39:47.551
Oh, it's like drifting
through the Garden of Eden.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.845
It's just beautiful.

39:50.012 --> 39:52.848
Look at this.
Frank, did you see these heliconias?

39:58.229 --> 40:00.439
Do you know
there's more individual species

40:00.523 --> 40:02.149
on one tree in the Amazon than there is...

40:12.493 --> 40:15.246
MacGregor, I think you seem
to be taking us off course.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.539
We should turn that way.

40:16.622 --> 40:17.998
FRANK: No, we're good. Stay on course.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.458
Lágrimas de Cristal is that way.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.543
LILY: Frank, Frank...
FRANK: He's fine.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.337
I'm not mistaken, I'm the skipper.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.256
The Lágrimas de Cristal is straight ahead.

40:25.339 --> 40:26.340
Stay on course.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.135
Frank, it says on the map
that it's passable.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.887
Here we have that cliff
and exactly that tributary.

40:32.054 --> 40:34.014
We can save two days going this way.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.142
We cannot go that way.
We have to go that way.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.601
Lágrimas de Cristal is that way.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.478
We go that way, it's rapids.
You ever been down the rapids?

40:39.562 --> 40:40.729
No, but I presume that you have...

40:40.813 --> 40:42.356
-Yes.
-...which is why I hired you!

40:42.898 --> 40:43.899
So just...

40:44.775 --> 40:47.695
turn that way. To the right.
Starboard. Whatever you call it.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.530
I'm not the one who can't swim, Pants.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.199
Don't you worry about that, Skippy.

40:56.245 --> 40:58.330
Lady, it's "Skipper."

40:58.497 --> 41:00.124
My mistake.

41:11.427 --> 41:14.930
JOACHIM: This godforsaken, endless Amazon,

41:15.097 --> 41:18.309
with its infinite tangled tributaries.

41:18.767 --> 41:22.146
Dr. Houghton and the Arrowhead
could be anywhere.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.689
There's only one person

41:23.898 --> 41:27.526
who has ever gotten close
to the Tears of the Moon.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.947
We shall have to ask him directly.
We'll set a new course.

41:33.282 --> 41:36.202
AXEL: But, Your Highness,
the curse of Don Aguirre...

41:37.536 --> 41:39.914
That's only a legend, right?

41:40.748 --> 41:42.500
-

41:42.958 --> 41:44.376
FRANK: We're gonna anchor here
for the night.

41:44.460 --> 41:47.463
LILY: Can't we make good time in the dark?
Look, we can just keep going.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.132
No, not unless you want
the engine to overheat.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.802
Tell you what, Skippy.
After this day,

41:53.886 --> 41:56.722
I could really do with
that luxurious bath of yours.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.183
Is it, um, down there?

42:00.476 --> 42:02.686
-No, there's no bath down there, Pants.
-LILY: What?

42:02.770 --> 42:05.481
No, the bath is out there.
That's the bath.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.776
4,300 miles of luxurious bath.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.153
I also warmed it
a little bit for you earlier.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.032
Oh, and I know you don't know how to swim,
so if you happen to drown out there,

42:15.115 --> 42:17.868
go ahead and, uh, use the soap
to wash yourself ashore.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.002
I could do with something to eat.

42:27.169 --> 42:29.922
Someone threw all of my reserve food
into the harbor.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.884
You know, Frank, if you think you're going
to cut our trip short by starving us,

42:34.051 --> 42:37.179
let me tell you that
that is extremely likely to work.

42:45.187 --> 42:47.189
Do you expect me to eat that?

42:55.239 --> 42:56.240
-LILY: Oh...

42:56.323 --> 42:57.324
FRANK: Piranha.

42:57.449 --> 42:58.617
Better eat them before they eat you.

43:01.704 --> 43:02.705
No way.

43:05.624 --> 43:08.586
Have to say, Frank.
These piranha are so good.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.838
Can't quite place that flavor, though.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.006
It's blood.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.675
Oh.

43:22.766 --> 43:23.851
Right.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.352
I'm to bed.

43:25.519 --> 43:28.522
Sleep anywhere you want downstairs,
just not in my cabin. It's off-limits.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.524
Why on Earth would I want to do that?

43:31.108 --> 43:32.109
Phew.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.280
Bugger!

43:40.534 --> 43:43.412
LILY: You're staring,
how do I make it stop?

43:44.163 --> 43:46.832
I'm just not used to seeing
a woman in pants, that's all.

43:46.999 --> 43:49.752
Awfully interested in my apparel, Frank.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.253
Get your head around it.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.212
FRANK: You know,
you really bring those eyes to life.

44:33.420 --> 44:35.130
Your perspective's a little off, though.

44:35.297 --> 44:36.298
LILY: What?

44:37.299 --> 44:38.509
Well, you're right, annoyingly.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.094
-Do you draw?
-I used to.

44:40.260 --> 44:41.261
Why'd you stop?

44:41.428 --> 44:43.013
Well, I drew everything I wanted to draw.

44:43.514 --> 44:44.932
Then I figured I'd learn something new.

44:45.015 --> 44:47.768
Or perhaps you just need
some proper inspiration.

44:48.394 --> 44:49.395
FRANK: What about you?

44:49.478 --> 44:51.522
Never lack for inspiration.

44:51.647 --> 44:53.524
No, I mean, what're you doing out here?

44:53.691 --> 44:57.111
Chasing maps all over the place?
Or is this your idea of fun?

44:57.277 --> 44:58.696
-The Tears of the Moon...
-Oh, come on.

44:58.779 --> 45:00.572
I believe that the legend is real.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.032
-Which it's not.
-And I'm gonna find it.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.701
-Which you won't.
-And when I do,

45:04.118 --> 45:06.203
just imagine the lives
that could be saved.

45:06.620 --> 45:09.456
Legend says one petal from the Tree
will heal anything.

45:09.915 --> 45:11.959
It will change medicine forever.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.253
It's the beginning
of a scientific revolution.

45:14.336 --> 45:15.671
It's very exciting, Frank.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.756
So, you wanna be the Darwin of flowers?

45:17.840 --> 45:19.466
And I want to help
as many people as I can.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.634
Wanna save the world?

45:20.718 --> 45:21.927
I didn't say "save the world."

45:22.010 --> 45:23.011
It's very noble.

45:23.095 --> 45:24.805
-Well, thank you.
-It's also very stupid.

45:24.888 --> 45:27.474
-You are deeply unpleasant.
-

45:28.100 --> 45:29.643
And off-key.

45:33.772 --> 45:36.233
So, you'd rather risk your life
and your brother's life

45:36.316 --> 45:37.735
to save people you don't even know?

45:37.818 --> 45:39.695
Well, I don't have to
know someone to care.

45:39.778 --> 45:41.780
Well, I don't have to care
about anybody, period.

45:41.864 --> 45:43.365
That's apparent.

45:43.532 --> 45:44.992
Look, I just think if you're lucky enough

45:45.075 --> 45:46.869
to have one person in this life
to care about,

45:46.952 --> 45:49.621
then that's world enough for me.

45:50.247 --> 45:51.915
"That's world enough for me."

45:51.999 --> 45:53.000
Hmm.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.418
-

45:55.794 --> 45:58.839
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my...

45:59.006 --> 46:00.007
MacGregor!

46:00.090 --> 46:02.259
-Proxima! Proxima!
-

46:02.426 --> 46:04.261
Heel there, Proxima! Proxima, heel.

46:04.428 --> 46:05.763
Heel.

46:05.929 --> 46:06.930
Proxima.

46:08.140 --> 46:09.391
LILY: This is your cat?

46:09.558 --> 46:10.601
So, that fight?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.228
-Faked it.
-For goodness' sake, Frank!

46:13.312 --> 46:15.689
Is there a single thing
about you that I can trust?

46:15.773 --> 46:16.940
Not a thing.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.073
Great timing.

46:28.619 --> 46:32.039
JOACHIM: The natives
speak of this place with dread.

46:33.165 --> 46:36.418
This is where Aguirre
and his men were punished

46:36.585 --> 46:39.004
for trying to steal the Arrowhead.

46:48.597 --> 46:49.598
There.

46:52.184 --> 46:53.560
River water.

46:55.521 --> 46:59.191
This is what you have been waiting for.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.480
Look who is here.

47:38.647 --> 47:42.359
The legend in the flesh.

47:42.985 --> 47:45.863
River water. You want to see more?

47:46.029 --> 47:50.450
A long, painful wait
to see the river again.

47:50.617 --> 47:53.245
The Tears of the Moon
can break your curse,

47:53.328 --> 47:54.872
free you from this jungle.

47:55.038 --> 47:59.334
You want what I need.

48:00.168 --> 48:01.712
Detonator.

48:06.174 --> 48:09.052
The Arrowhead is near.

48:10.971 --> 48:14.349
You will find it for me,

48:14.516 --> 48:17.644
and we both get what we want. Deal?

48:19.730 --> 48:20.731
Swear it.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.066
Good.

49:17.579 --> 49:20.040
All right, we're about to hit
the butter churn. Ready, Pants?

49:20.624 --> 49:22.334
You sure this is the only way?

49:22.417 --> 49:25.087
FRANK: You picked the route.
You wanted to save two days.

49:25.170 --> 49:28.006
Uh, "butter churn,"
how literal a metaphor?

49:28.090 --> 49:29.257
If you have anything of value,

49:29.341 --> 49:31.176
I would recommend
that you store it below deck.

49:31.259 --> 49:33.845
Since I consider myself of value,
I will see you all on the other side.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.764
Wait a minute. MacGregor.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

49:39.309 --> 49:40.602
Do not lose it.

49:41.853 --> 49:43.146
-You see that?
-

49:43.230 --> 49:45.315
I want you to bring that to me.

49:45.399 --> 49:46.900
It's been lovely knowing you.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.527
LILY: Don't say that.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.237
Go.

49:57.786 --> 50:00.497
Oh, not you again. Go away.

50:03.291 --> 50:04.584
You sure you're up for this, Pants?

50:04.668 --> 50:06.211
Just drive the boat, Skippy.

50:07.129 --> 50:09.339
That ruddy cat!

50:09.506 --> 50:11.383
-LILY: What are you doing?
-She's incessant.

50:24.396 --> 50:25.397
Here we go.

50:31.820 --> 50:32.821
Oh, my God!

50:34.823 --> 50:36.700
-

50:38.869 --> 50:39.870
You okay, lady?

50:39.953 --> 50:41.830
-I'm fine.
-You wanna turn back, Pants?

50:41.913 --> 50:43.498
Nope. Just getting started.

50:44.791 --> 50:46.168
Good. Me, too.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.006
Slow down!

50:59.514 --> 51:00.682
You wanna turn back?

51:00.766 --> 51:01.808
Just drive!

51:25.832 --> 51:27.417
Looks like you wet your pants, Pants.

51:27.501 --> 51:28.877
That was the wave.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.170
You should give up.

51:30.295 --> 51:32.214
You should give up the guitar.

51:46.645 --> 51:48.855
-Oh, my God!
-

52:07.874 --> 52:10.001
-FRANK: Come on, buena niña.
-

52:18.927 --> 52:20.762
-Come on!
-

52:50.500 --> 52:52.335
Please don't ever do that again.

52:52.502 --> 52:55.130
I could turn the boat around and we could
head back to town, how's that?

52:55.213 --> 52:57.507
That may be the first intelligent thing
you've said since we met.

53:00.510 --> 53:01.845
FRANK: How about you, Pants?

53:02.345 --> 53:03.346
You ready to go back to town?

53:05.348 --> 53:06.558
No?

53:06.725 --> 53:09.519
I actually loved, uh,
the whole experience.

53:09.603 --> 53:12.230
I... I found it, um, exhilarating.

53:12.397 --> 53:13.773
You're looking a little green
around the gills.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.401
That's why I'm asking.
Are you okay?

53:16.860 --> 53:17.944
Are you hungry?

53:19.571 --> 53:20.697
Yeah, she's hungry.

53:21.156 --> 53:23.575
Have some cured piranha
if you think you...

53:38.798 --> 53:40.383
Did you get it?

53:41.635 --> 53:42.802
Ugh!

53:43.511 --> 53:44.554
You're drunk?

53:44.721 --> 53:47.474
You're the worst cat I have ever had.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.653
I don't know how you live with that woman.

53:59.736 --> 54:02.948
I've been with her for two days,
and I already wanna throw her overboard.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.325
Does take some getting used to.

54:07.827 --> 54:09.746
Does she ever stop being so, uh...

54:09.829 --> 54:11.873
-Lily?
-Yes.

54:12.332 --> 54:13.458
Afraid not.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.710
Headfirst, figure it out on the way down.

54:16.586 --> 54:18.880
It should be on her crest in Latin.

54:23.426 --> 54:24.469
Hmm.

54:31.017 --> 54:32.310
What you doing?

54:38.316 --> 54:39.693
Your funeral.

54:47.575 --> 54:49.327
It's just a peek.

54:57.919 --> 55:00.005
FRANK: Your sister says
whatever she wants to say

55:00.088 --> 55:01.548
to whoever she wants to say it.

55:01.631 --> 55:03.800
No regard for anybody's feelings.

55:04.384 --> 55:06.761
Doesn't matter who gets hurt. Usually me.

55:06.845 --> 55:09.097
She takes after our father.

55:09.264 --> 55:12.225
He was always chasing after
some far-fetched idea.

55:12.350 --> 55:15.437
There's no such thing as curses.
Or cure-alls.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.939
And there hasn't been a conquistador here
for three centuries.

55:18.148 --> 55:19.149
Hmm.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.510
So, why'd you follow her out here, then?

55:49.512 --> 55:51.681
It was the third time
that I'd been presented

55:51.765 --> 55:53.224
with an entirely suitable marriage

55:53.308 --> 55:57.312
to a charming, educated woman
that sits on a horse well,

55:58.229 --> 56:02.108
that I had to tell the lady in question

56:02.275 --> 56:04.361
that I couldn't accept the offer.

56:04.944 --> 56:08.114
Or, indeed, any offer,

56:08.281 --> 56:11.409
given that my interests happily lie...

56:13.078 --> 56:14.245
elsewhere.

56:19.167 --> 56:20.627
Elsewhere?

56:21.711 --> 56:22.962
Elsewhere.

56:23.046 --> 56:24.255
Huh.

56:24.339 --> 56:26.299
Well... To elsewhere.

56:33.306 --> 56:35.683
Uncle threatened to disinherit me,

56:35.850 --> 56:37.811
friends and family turned their backs...

56:39.479 --> 56:40.897
all because of who I loved.

56:41.398 --> 56:44.150
I would've been ostracized from society

56:45.318 --> 56:46.903
were it not for Lily.

56:48.613 --> 56:50.073
She stood by me.

56:50.990 --> 56:54.160
And for that,
I would follow her into a volcano.

57:07.674 --> 57:09.676
Pants! Let's shove off!

57:14.264 --> 57:16.057
Would you care to explain this?

57:19.436 --> 57:20.645
I said stay out of my quarters.

57:20.812 --> 57:21.938
Oh, I bet you did.

57:22.021 --> 57:23.440
So that you could keep
more secrets from us.

57:23.523 --> 57:26.818
Just lie upon lie. I mean, Frank,
you are like an onion of deceit.

57:26.901 --> 57:28.862
-What lies?
-That you're after it yourself!

57:28.945 --> 57:31.531
I am not after it! Not anymore.

57:33.616 --> 57:35.034
Not for a long, long time.

57:35.702 --> 57:36.911
Okay, yes,

57:36.995 --> 57:39.539
I came here seeking
the Tears of the Moon, just like you.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.166
I have a map just like yours.

57:43.835 --> 57:45.712
And a dozen others just like it.

57:47.505 --> 57:50.300
LILY: Aguirre's cartographer
certainly was prolific.

57:50.467 --> 57:53.261
Yeah, well, he lost his life searching
for something that can't be found.

57:53.344 --> 57:57.348
I've tracked the legend to every village,
every island, every shoal.

57:58.183 --> 57:59.559
Nothing.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.020
And now I'm stuck
on this river ever since,

58:02.187 --> 58:04.689
wishing I could be anywhere else but here.

58:11.571 --> 58:13.198
But you never had this.

58:20.538 --> 58:23.541
I'm going to pet you now.
And you're not going to eat me.

58:23.708 --> 58:25.335
-Understood?
-

58:26.085 --> 58:27.670
Easing in.

58:27.754 --> 58:29.547
-About to engage.
-

58:29.631 --> 58:33.051
You're not that bad really, are you,
for a big, hairy murder cat?

58:34.761 --> 58:37.430
I don't usually offend so immediately.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.307
-

58:39.390 --> 58:40.391
Lily!

58:41.684 --> 58:42.685
LILY: MacGregor.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.027
Oh...

59:07.043 --> 59:08.253
MACGREGOR: Where are they taking us?

59:08.545 --> 59:10.755
FRANK: We're headed
into headhunter territory,

59:10.922 --> 59:13.591
which is a terrible place to be headed.

59:13.758 --> 59:16.135
LILY: Oh, Frank, come on, not now.

59:16.302 --> 59:17.762
FRANK: I can't turn it off.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.103
Lily!

59:25.270 --> 59:26.312
LILY: Frank!

59:28.106 --> 59:29.232
Frank.

59:40.952 --> 59:43.496
-

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:25.121
...MacGregor...

1:00:30.001 --> 1:00:31.044
What did you say?

1:00:31.210 --> 1:00:35.048
I said that they should let you
and your brother MacGregor go, and live.

1:00:35.131 --> 1:00:38.092
In exchange, you'll have to leave
all of your things and your clothes,

1:00:38.176 --> 1:00:39.510
and I'll stay back as well.

1:00:39.594 --> 1:00:40.803
That's very, very brave.

1:00:40.887 --> 1:00:43.139
That is not something I agree to, Frank.
We're not doing it.

1:00:43.222 --> 1:00:45.683
There's no way that the three of us
can get out of this situation alive.

1:00:45.767 --> 1:00:47.435
I know these people.
Leave now and let them...

1:00:47.518 --> 1:00:49.395
-No!
-Can I please talk for five minutes

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:51.314
-without you interrupting me?
-

1:00:54.692 --> 1:00:56.277
Oh, now you've done it.

1:00:59.530 --> 1:01:00.740
Oh, no.

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:05.953
"The only thing of yours I want

1:01:06.829 --> 1:01:08.331
-"is the Arrowhead."
- No.

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:09.874
Don't shake your head like that.
They hate that.

1:01:09.957 --> 1:01:10.958
They hate that. Don't do that.

1:01:13.461 --> 1:01:15.046
"I know you have it.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:17.882
"It belongs to my people, taken long ago.

1:01:18.883 --> 1:01:20.802
"You can return it and go free.

1:01:21.219 --> 1:01:23.054
"Or I can pry it from your fingers.

1:01:24.555 --> 1:01:26.557
"After I pick them clean of meat."

1:01:26.641 --> 1:01:28.393
-MACGREGOR: Oh.
-

1:01:29.936 --> 1:01:32.063
Come on. You heard the nice cannibal.

1:01:32.146 --> 1:01:33.314
-Hand it over.
-I'm a little rusty

1:01:33.398 --> 1:01:34.899
in the Puka Michuna dialect,

1:01:34.982 --> 1:01:38.069
so I want you to translate what I say,
word for word.

1:01:38.152 --> 1:01:39.153
Okay.

1:01:39.237 --> 1:01:41.030
No, I cannot give you the Arrowhead.

1:01:41.114 --> 1:01:42.657
-Oh, God. Lily.
-Lily.

1:01:42.740 --> 1:01:43.866
Shut up.
Just say it.

1:01:44.033 --> 1:01:47.078
Yes, I have the Arrow
that belongs to your people.

1:01:48.287 --> 1:01:51.165
She's being weird about the Arrowhead.

1:01:51.332 --> 1:01:52.667
I will return it.

1:01:52.750 --> 1:01:54.085
She's extremely difficult.

1:01:54.252 --> 1:01:57.088
But first I must use it to find
the Tears of the Moon.

1:01:57.380 --> 1:01:58.589
It's hard to be around her.

1:01:58.673 --> 1:02:01.050
Now, if I die for that, so be it.

1:02:01.134 --> 1:02:03.553
She doesn't mind if you kill her.

1:02:03.636 --> 1:02:05.680
But you must let these two men go free.

1:02:05.847 --> 1:02:08.391
Just don't kill me.

1:02:11.310 --> 1:02:12.353
Lily!

1:02:12.895 --> 1:02:15.356
Come on, fight me.
You, come on, fight me.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:17.233
Go! Do it! What's wrong with you?

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.943
Lily...

1:02:28.995 --> 1:02:30.204
Seriously, Frank.

1:02:30.288 --> 1:02:33.124
Next time I'm going to charge you more
for this "booga-booga" nonsense.

1:02:33.207 --> 1:02:34.500
Sam, we had a deal, okay?

1:02:34.584 --> 1:02:36.919
No, no. I'm tired,
and this is a whole production,

1:02:37.086 --> 1:02:38.671
with these ridiculous costumes!

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:40.006
And you told me

1:02:40.173 --> 1:02:42.842
this was a nice English lady
with her wimpy brother.

1:02:43.009 --> 1:02:44.427
And she's gonna get herself killed.

1:02:44.510 --> 1:02:46.053
I know, because she's crazy!

1:02:47.138 --> 1:02:48.973
She's crazy determined.

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:52.143
Lily, listen, the truth is I didn't get
a chance to call this entire thing off.

1:02:52.226 --> 1:02:55.104
Remember, it's only a scam
if you fall for it.

1:02:59.901 --> 1:03:01.068
You've gotta stop doing that.

1:03:01.235 --> 1:03:02.737
-Wimpy, eh?
-In a strong way.

1:03:05.531 --> 1:03:08.910
Strong form.
The whole family has strong form.

1:03:11.496 --> 1:03:12.872
Can you translate it?

1:03:13.581 --> 1:03:14.791
Possibly.

1:03:16.209 --> 1:03:19.712
Possibly, but, you know,
there are some impediments.

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:23.299
Your English gets very exact
when you want something.

1:03:23.424 --> 1:03:26.135
I have the tingling impression
we're to negotiate a price.

1:03:26.219 --> 1:03:27.345
You get me.

1:03:27.887 --> 1:03:29.305
Trader Sam likes a trade.

1:03:29.388 --> 1:03:30.932
Oh, I bet.

1:03:33.184 --> 1:03:34.644
-Would you like that hat?
-TRADER SAM: Hmm.

1:03:34.727 --> 1:03:35.853
You can have that hat.

1:03:40.107 --> 1:03:42.026
You've really done it now.

1:03:44.695 --> 1:03:47.490
You think she'll get over it?
-Not likely.

1:03:47.824 --> 1:03:50.993
It wasn't personal, you know.
It was a pre-existing arrangement.

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:53.496
Cross Lily like that
and you are dead to her.

1:03:53.663 --> 1:03:55.957
Dead and buried.

1:03:56.874 --> 1:03:58.292
Entombed.

1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:01.504
-Embalmed and entombed.
-I got it.

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:03.673
-Dead as a dodo.
-You're making it very clear.

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:05.299
-Dead, dead, dead.
-MacGregor.

1:04:05.466 --> 1:04:06.717
This beer's actually rather nice.

1:04:07.176 --> 1:04:08.803
-It's masato.
-Hmm.

1:04:09.929 --> 1:04:11.931
It's made out of fermented spit.

1:04:12.098 --> 1:04:13.641
You're drinking spit.

1:04:19.605 --> 1:04:20.606
When in Rome.

1:04:24.318 --> 1:04:26.070
God, I wish I was in Rome.

1:04:27.071 --> 1:04:28.531
"The Tears of the Moon

1:04:30.032 --> 1:04:33.536
"possess the power to cure anything."

1:04:34.954 --> 1:04:36.706
Now, this word here,

1:04:36.873 --> 1:04:39.333
there's no exact translation
in English. It's...

1:04:42.211 --> 1:04:43.337
a pain to...

1:04:45.590 --> 1:04:46.841
the soul.

1:04:49.093 --> 1:04:50.094
Heal. Heal.

1:04:51.429 --> 1:04:52.638
Heal the soul.

1:04:52.722 --> 1:04:53.723
Pretty much.

1:04:53.806 --> 1:04:54.891
Mm-hmm. Heal.

1:04:56.392 --> 1:05:00.396
"To prove yourself worthy,
you must turn water to stone.

1:05:00.563 --> 1:05:03.149
"Then mend a broken heart."

1:05:03.232 --> 1:05:04.609
MACGREGOR: Ooh.

1:05:08.029 --> 1:05:09.822
TRADER SAM: "For Tears to bloom,

1:05:09.989 --> 1:05:13.075
"the great Tree must be
under the rare crying Moon."

1:05:13.826 --> 1:05:15.161
There is one in two days.

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:17.580
"The Tree hides

1:05:17.997 --> 1:05:19.081
"where the Moon bled.

1:05:19.457 --> 1:05:22.919
"It sank into the west,
over the heart of the serpent."

1:05:23.002 --> 1:05:24.045
Serpent.

1:05:25.212 --> 1:05:27.548
"Where the fang bites its own tail..."

1:05:28.507 --> 1:05:31.594
LILY: "Where the fang bites its tail."
Oh, my goodness.

1:05:31.761 --> 1:05:33.471
TRADER SAM: Now, I told you
it was complicated.

1:05:33.554 --> 1:05:34.639
Of course no one's ever found it.

1:05:34.722 --> 1:05:36.515
Right, because it's not
in Lágrimas de Cristal.

1:05:36.599 --> 1:05:37.975
It's here. La Luna Rota.

1:05:38.059 --> 1:05:39.060
Yes.

1:05:40.770 --> 1:05:43.189
How long would you say
it would take me to get down there?

1:05:43.272 --> 1:05:44.273
Two or three days.

1:05:44.357 --> 1:05:45.650
What about via canoe?

1:05:45.733 --> 1:05:46.734
BOTH: Excuse me?

1:05:46.817 --> 1:05:50.071
Please inform Captain Skippy that
I will be traveling alone from now on.

1:05:50.154 --> 1:05:51.489
You're never gonna make it alone, Lily.

1:05:51.572 --> 1:05:54.700
Please tell him that he misjudges
my determination, also my driving skills.

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:57.787
Please tell Dr. Pants
that what's out there in the jungle,

1:05:57.954 --> 1:06:00.289
she's never read about
in her little textbooks. Tell her that.

1:06:00.373 --> 1:06:02.792
Well, I'm not gonna be falling
for any more of his ludicrous tricks.

1:06:02.875 --> 1:06:03.918
They're getting really tedious.

1:06:04.001 --> 1:06:06.003
If you go upriver by yourself
with that thing around your neck,

1:06:06.087 --> 1:06:07.254
-you're never gonna make it out alive.
-Really?

1:06:07.338 --> 1:06:08.339
We have to stick together.

1:06:08.422 --> 1:06:09.715
-Do we?
-Yes, we do.

1:06:09.799 --> 1:06:11.050
"We" is an interesting word, Frank.

1:06:11.133 --> 1:06:13.970
Because it sort of implies
a bond of trust and honesty.

1:06:14.136 --> 1:06:17.306
Neither of which you know anything about,
because you are a liar, Frank.

1:06:17.390 --> 1:06:19.558
You are selfish, you are arrogant,

1:06:19.642 --> 1:06:21.852
and I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you,

1:06:21.936 --> 1:06:24.105
which clearly isn't very far,
because you are huge.

1:06:24.188 --> 1:06:25.982
So, there is no more "we," actually.

1:06:26.065 --> 1:06:27.733
In fact, here's the rest of your 12,000.

1:06:27.817 --> 1:06:31.028
Oh, and here's a tip
for such wonderful service.

1:06:35.324 --> 1:06:37.743
This one is a driver.

1:06:37.910 --> 1:06:39.537
TRIBESPEOPLE: Driver.

1:06:39.704 --> 1:06:42.957
Yes. Use that for anything over 200 yards.

1:06:43.874 --> 1:06:46.210
Under that, you'll need an iron.

1:06:50.047 --> 1:06:52.591
War paint? Righto, yes.

1:06:53.259 --> 1:06:55.344
For a warrior. Dilly!

1:06:58.347 --> 1:06:59.724
Tickles.

1:07:02.977 --> 1:07:04.395
This doesn't appear to be coming off.

1:07:04.478 --> 1:07:07.314
That's 'cause it's tattoo ink.
It'll come off eventually.

1:07:07.481 --> 1:07:08.774
In a few decades.

1:07:08.941 --> 1:07:10.109
Oh, no.

1:07:15.406 --> 1:07:18.075
Francisco...

1:07:43.184 --> 1:07:44.477
-Lily!
-Oh... Frank, what?

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:45.978
-We have to get out of here now.
-What?

1:07:46.062 --> 1:07:47.897
-Give me the Arrowhead.
-LILY: Do you think I'm a fool?

1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:49.106
I think you must think I'm a fool.

1:07:50.775 --> 1:07:52.693
Francisco...

1:07:55.029 --> 1:07:56.989
Francisco...

1:08:00.493 --> 1:08:02.244
-What's going on?
-That's what I was trying to tell you.

1:08:13.047 --> 1:08:14.256
No.

1:08:17.051 --> 1:08:18.803
You seem surprised.

1:08:19.178 --> 1:08:20.805
It's impossible.

1:08:23.766 --> 1:08:25.559
The myth is real.

1:08:25.643 --> 1:08:27.311
After 400 years...

1:08:27.478 --> 1:08:28.604
The Arrowhead...

1:08:28.771 --> 1:08:29.814
...belongs to me.

1:08:33.025 --> 1:08:34.360
-Save your family!
-Yes!

1:08:37.113 --> 1:08:38.155
Oh, God!

1:08:39.990 --> 1:08:41.742
-Frank, Frank! Frank!
-

1:08:42.076 --> 1:08:44.120
-

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:02.138
-

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:27.329
Come on. I got you, Pants. Trust me.

1:09:29.039 --> 1:09:30.708
-Hold on!
-

1:09:36.213 --> 1:09:37.840
Frank? Frank, get it.

1:09:39.383 --> 1:09:40.384
-Hold on.
-Come on.

1:09:42.428 --> 1:09:43.429
-Frank, please.
-I got it.

1:09:43.512 --> 1:09:44.597
-Frank.
-I don't got it.

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:45.681
-Frank!
-Oh, my God!

1:09:48.559 --> 1:09:51.103
-Frank, get off me! What're you doing?
-I'm trying to get traction.

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:52.688
-LILY: This is ridiculous!
-No, no, wait.

1:09:52.771 --> 1:09:54.607
Just leave me alone!
That was a disaster!

1:09:54.690 --> 1:09:55.774
You're too heavy.

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:56.942
MacGregor!

1:09:57.109 --> 1:09:58.319
Lily?

1:09:58.736 --> 1:09:59.737
Sorry.

1:10:01.197 --> 1:10:02.698
-

1:10:18.297 --> 1:10:20.341
-

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:31.018
Get off her!

1:10:37.066 --> 1:10:38.901
-LILY: No!
-Aguirre!

1:10:53.791 --> 1:10:55.125
Driver.

1:10:55.292 --> 1:10:56.543
-Lovely shot, sir.
-The Arrow.

1:11:14.603 --> 1:11:15.688
-

1:11:22.444 --> 1:11:23.445
AGUIRRE: No!

1:11:24.738 --> 1:11:25.906
Frank!

1:11:40.337 --> 1:11:41.630
TRADER SAM: We gotta go! Come on!

1:11:42.214 --> 1:11:44.174
Get in! Grab that knife!

1:11:45.009 --> 1:11:46.010
Now!

1:11:51.140 --> 1:11:52.141
Are you all right? What have you done?

1:11:53.559 --> 1:11:54.810
LILY: It's all right. It's all right.

1:11:56.020 --> 1:11:58.772
You must go.
Get out of sight of the river and run.

1:11:58.939 --> 1:12:00.399
Aguirre only wants the Arrowhead.

1:12:00.566 --> 1:12:02.443
-Just run as fast as you can.
-Go.

1:12:02.735 --> 1:12:05.154
They're coming! Go!
Get away from the river!

1:12:06.488 --> 1:12:08.532
-

1:12:15.622 --> 1:12:16.623
I have her!

1:12:17.624 --> 1:12:18.625
LILY: No!

1:12:18.709 --> 1:12:20.044
Give me the Arrowhead!

1:12:21.962 --> 1:12:23.714
Aguirre, we're too far from the river!

1:12:24.715 --> 1:12:26.884
-

1:12:44.651 --> 1:12:46.028
Oh, my God!

1:12:46.111 --> 1:12:48.655
-It's cool. It's me. It's me.
-Whoo!

1:12:54.495 --> 1:12:55.537
Did you see the Arrowhead?

1:12:56.246 --> 1:12:57.289
Have you really seen it?

1:12:57.456 --> 1:12:59.708
Not only have I seen it,
I held it in my hands.

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:01.251
Finally we can break the curse...

1:13:01.418 --> 1:13:02.961
and Francisco shall pay.

1:13:03.128 --> 1:13:05.547
Forget about Francisco!
The Arrowhead, Aguirre!

1:13:05.964 --> 1:13:09.218
Only the Tears of the Moon can help us get
out of this curse.

1:13:09.593 --> 1:13:11.553
MELCHOR:
This jungle is devouring our souls.

1:13:11.929 --> 1:13:13.305
We are disgusting.

1:13:14.223 --> 1:13:16.141
Speak for yourself. I am delicious.

1:13:18.102 --> 1:13:20.604
Do you really believe we still have souls?

1:13:21.105 --> 1:13:25.192
That's why we need the Tears of the Moon,
they are our only hope.

1:13:25.401 --> 1:13:27.986
The woman in pants has the Arrowhead...

1:13:28.153 --> 1:13:29.863
and has taken it away from the river.

1:13:30.030 --> 1:13:31.865
Because she knows
we can't follow her there.

1:13:32.032 --> 1:13:33.200
The Prince.

1:13:35.285 --> 1:13:37.413
He can follow the Arrowhead.

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:39.415
Tell him where she went.

1:13:39.790 --> 1:13:40.833
You heard him.

1:13:40.999 --> 1:13:42.709
Tell the Prince.

1:13:45.963 --> 1:13:47.172
LILY: MacGregor!

1:13:49.091 --> 1:13:50.759
MacGregor!

1:13:50.926 --> 1:13:52.219
MacGregor!

1:13:53.554 --> 1:13:54.930
MacGregor!

1:14:08.485 --> 1:14:09.653
Frank?

1:14:10.696 --> 1:14:11.822
Frank, you're alive.

1:14:11.989 --> 1:14:13.991
How? How are you alive, Frank?

1:14:15.075 --> 1:14:16.535
-I saw you die.

1:14:16.618 --> 1:14:18.203
I saw you fall. How are you alive?

1:14:18.287 --> 1:14:19.872
Lily, I don't care
what you've done for me,

1:14:19.955 --> 1:14:21.957
-if we make it out of here alive...
-LILY: Oh, there you are.

1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:23.667
...I am never leaving Kensington again.

1:14:23.750 --> 1:14:26.044
-Yeah. Frank's alive.

1:14:26.128 --> 1:14:28.213
Huh. Oh, um...

1:14:29.465 --> 1:14:32.384
You've got a little, um,
something in your back.

1:14:35.679 --> 1:14:36.805
LILY: Frank?

1:14:37.931 --> 1:14:40.058
The name's actually Francisco.

1:14:41.351 --> 1:14:43.896
Francisco Lopez de Heredia.

1:14:44.062 --> 1:14:45.272
And...

1:14:46.815 --> 1:14:48.567
I'm roughly 400 years old.

1:14:49.276 --> 1:14:50.903
-What?
-I know it's a lot to take in.

1:14:50.986 --> 1:14:54.364
-I will explain to you the entire story...
-There's no blood in you.

1:14:54.448 --> 1:14:55.449
Are you a ghost?

1:14:55.908 --> 1:14:57.117
No, it's complicated.

1:14:57.451 --> 1:15:00.370
But clearly you're... you're not a human.

1:15:00.537 --> 1:15:03.707
Okay, but it's very hard to focus
when I have a sword impaled in my heart.

1:15:04.082 --> 1:15:05.459
Trader Sam, I need you to come and pull.

1:15:05.542 --> 1:15:06.543
Vampire?

1:15:06.627 --> 1:15:09.087
I told you last time,
I'm done pulling weapons out of you.

1:15:11.298 --> 1:15:12.341
Oh, no.

1:15:14.593 --> 1:15:16.845
It is, uh, Dr. Houghton, right?

1:15:17.179 --> 1:15:18.597
Of Botany.

1:15:18.764 --> 1:15:20.724
Look at it.
It's just hanging out like that.

1:15:20.807 --> 1:15:22.392
FRANK: Well, it's how it's made.

1:15:22.476 --> 1:15:23.560
It's got a very strange shape.

1:15:23.644 --> 1:15:25.896
Have you seen it out the back?
It's like... Woo... Like that.

1:15:25.979 --> 1:15:28.440
Well, it's not...
It's kinda actually just straight.

1:15:29.566 --> 1:15:31.318
One hand, two hand,
what do you want?

1:15:31.401 --> 1:15:32.402
Let's try one.

1:15:35.447 --> 1:15:37.074
You're gonna need two hands.

1:15:38.116 --> 1:15:39.117
FRANK: No, no, no!

1:15:39.201 --> 1:15:41.328
-What, what, what?
-Oh, my gosh! That hurts.

1:15:41.411 --> 1:15:42.704
-No, it doesn't.
-How do you know?

1:15:42.788 --> 1:15:45.290
Frank, would you like
to bite down on my stick?

1:15:45.457 --> 1:15:47.209
-Nope. I'm good. Thank you.
-No, for the pain.

1:15:47.292 --> 1:15:48.418
-I understand what it...

1:15:48.502 --> 1:15:49.586
What he means. But no.

1:15:49.670 --> 1:15:51.129
There if you need it.

1:15:51.296 --> 1:15:52.923
I just feel like
you're very uptight right now.

1:15:53.006 --> 1:15:54.675
And it's not helping me,
'cause I'm very nervous.

1:15:54.758 --> 1:15:56.301
It's okay to be nervous.
It's your first time.

1:15:56.385 --> 1:15:57.928
-It is your first time, right?

1:15:58.011 --> 1:15:59.972
-Yes, you know it is, Frank.
-I know, I know. I can tell.

1:16:00.055 --> 1:16:01.807
-I've done this hundreds of times.

1:16:01.890 --> 1:16:03.809
-I don't know how to take that, Frank.
-This is special.

1:16:03.892 --> 1:16:05.185
-Is it?
-It is.

1:16:05.269 --> 1:16:06.395
-Slow!
-What?

1:16:06.478 --> 1:16:07.688
FRANK: Oh, you can't do it like that.

1:16:07.771 --> 1:16:08.855
-That's way too hard.
-LILY: Frank.

1:16:08.939 --> 1:16:10.065
Would you like me to give it a wiggle?

1:16:10.148 --> 1:16:11.149
-Yes. Yes.
-Absolutely not.

1:16:11.233 --> 1:16:12.901
I could pop around the back
and give it a once over.

1:16:12.985 --> 1:16:15.028
-No, we're good.
-Okay.

1:16:15.195 --> 1:16:18.198
You know what always helps?
If you put your foot on it.

1:16:18.323 --> 1:16:20.242
-I'm a little nervous.
-Don't be nervous.

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:22.286
Frank, I'm gonna count to three.

1:16:22.369 --> 1:16:23.870
You're gonna... I'm counting or...

1:16:23.954 --> 1:16:25.038
No, I'm counting.

1:16:25.122 --> 1:16:26.873
-One.
-'Cause... Ahhh!

1:16:35.841 --> 1:16:38.427
I dreamt I was lunching at Boodle's.

1:16:38.510 --> 1:16:40.429
-FRANK: Hey, Doctor.

1:16:41.638 --> 1:16:42.848
-We should go.
-Of course.

1:16:42.931 --> 1:16:44.433
No. You've done enough.

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:46.101
I can't leave you alone out here.

1:16:46.268 --> 1:16:49.062
Look at the state of you.
And you can't even walk.

1:16:49.229 --> 1:16:51.189
Will you at least consider turning back?

1:16:52.482 --> 1:16:55.235
I will be fine. I promise.

1:17:00.574 --> 1:17:01.700
Do I smell?

1:17:01.867 --> 1:17:03.410
Horrendously.

1:17:17.799 --> 1:17:19.926
We have visitors. Open the hatch.

1:17:34.816 --> 1:17:37.903
Good afternoon, my friends.

1:17:46.244 --> 1:17:47.329
Something is there?

1:17:48.997 --> 1:17:52.167
What is there?
You have found their river boat?

1:17:54.753 --> 1:17:55.879
No?

1:17:56.338 --> 1:17:58.840
Not the river boat? The Arrowhead?

1:18:00.842 --> 1:18:04.346
The Arrowhead? Yes.
Show... Show me where.

1:18:04.513 --> 1:18:06.640
We're taking orders from a bee.

1:18:06.723 --> 1:18:07.849
JOACHIM: Show me on the map.

1:18:10.477 --> 1:18:11.520
Here?

1:18:11.645 --> 1:18:13.605
Yes! You heard him. Change course!

1:18:16.149 --> 1:18:18.193
Could you ask the bee for coordinates?

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:22.364
Don't be ridiculous, Axel.

1:18:24.032 --> 1:18:25.992
Thank you.

1:18:30.330 --> 1:18:33.834
395 years...

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.712
...five months and 13 days.

1:18:36.795 --> 1:18:38.672
I really thought you died.

1:18:41.967 --> 1:18:43.176
Were you sad when I died?

1:18:43.343 --> 1:18:45.137
I was very concerned.

1:18:45.262 --> 1:18:46.263
For my soul.

1:18:46.346 --> 1:18:47.514
For my expedition.

1:18:49.641 --> 1:18:50.642
And for you.

1:18:55.188 --> 1:18:56.565
So, what are you?

1:18:57.107 --> 1:18:59.651
You don't bleed, I think you breathe.

1:19:00.944 --> 1:19:02.404
You're not possible.

1:19:02.571 --> 1:19:04.531
I don't know what I am anymore.

1:19:06.074 --> 1:19:07.659
But I can tell you what I was.

1:19:10.662 --> 1:19:12.372
My father was a mercenary

1:19:12.539 --> 1:19:17.127
and he was recruited
by Aguirre's father in Algiers.

1:19:20.213 --> 1:19:22.883
When my father died protecting him,
he took me in.

1:19:23.049 --> 1:19:25.969
Raised Aguirre and me together,
like brothers.

1:19:26.136 --> 1:19:28.555
Aguirre's daughter Anna had fallen ill.

1:19:29.598 --> 1:19:32.225
She was all he had.
He vowed he wouldn't lose her.

1:19:33.101 --> 1:19:34.436
I will travel far.

1:19:35.604 --> 1:19:37.731
But I will come back to you
with a Tear of the Moon.

1:19:38.815 --> 1:19:41.234
And you will run again in the moonlight.

1:19:41.443 --> 1:19:42.486
Healed.

1:19:54.873 --> 1:19:58.168
We fought the ocean,
only to be beaten by the river.

1:19:59.461 --> 1:20:01.338
The jungle fought our every step.

1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:04.174
I would've done anything
to find the Tears of the Moon

1:20:04.257 --> 1:20:05.717
and save Aguirre's daughter.

1:20:05.926 --> 1:20:07.469
Even chart the Amazon.

1:20:11.973 --> 1:20:14.518
LILY: You were Aguirre's cartographer?

1:20:15.352 --> 1:20:16.686
You drew my map?

1:20:18.313 --> 1:20:19.523
Frank...

1:20:19.606 --> 1:20:21.191
Really think my work is extraordinary?

1:20:21.274 --> 1:20:23.652
I think you were
a minor master of your time.

1:20:23.735 --> 1:20:24.736
Minor?

1:20:29.741 --> 1:20:32.035
FRANK: One by one, the jungle took us.

1:20:33.745 --> 1:20:37.082
We were all but dead.
Still, Aguirre wouldn't turn back.

1:20:39.084 --> 1:20:41.878
There was no world for him
without his daughter in it.

1:20:42.796 --> 1:20:43.922
And then they came.

1:20:46.383 --> 1:20:49.886
We would've all died had they not saved us
with the Tears of the Moon.

1:20:50.178 --> 1:20:52.013
The petal's magic was real.

1:20:52.889 --> 1:20:56.142
Its powers unlocked
by the Chief and his daughter.

1:20:57.352 --> 1:21:00.063
All that was broken, the petals mended.

1:21:00.564 --> 1:21:03.191
And all at once, we were revived.

1:21:04.818 --> 1:21:05.944
And Aguirre was happy,

1:21:06.027 --> 1:21:09.406
because he was closer than ever
to finding a cure for his daughter.

1:21:13.326 --> 1:21:14.744
But he grew impatient.

1:21:18.582 --> 1:21:21.042
Aguirre demanded
they give him the Arrowhead

1:21:21.459 --> 1:21:22.502
and take him to the Tree.

1:21:22.752 --> 1:21:24.337
You are not worthy.

1:21:25.046 --> 1:21:26.298
The Chief refused.

1:21:29.134 --> 1:21:30.260
-

1:21:32.554 --> 1:21:34.723
Despite all the kindness they'd shown us,

1:21:35.682 --> 1:21:37.058
he would've killed every last one of them.

1:21:40.478 --> 1:21:41.771
She has the Arrowhead!

1:21:43.523 --> 1:21:45.901
I loved Aguirre,
but I couldn't be part of the madness.

1:21:45.984 --> 1:21:47.402
I'm not going to hurt you.

1:21:47.485 --> 1:21:48.737
I only want the Arrowhead.

1:21:48.820 --> 1:21:50.822
And I couldn't just stand by.

1:21:50.906 --> 1:21:52.073
Give it to me!

1:21:55.035 --> 1:21:56.077
Run!

1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:58.121
No!

1:21:58.413 --> 1:22:00.707
A brother's blade cuts deepest.

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:02.250
Traitor.

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.186
The Chief knew
he was breathing his last breath.

1:22:21.603 --> 1:22:23.647
And he used that breath
to protect the Arrowhead

1:22:23.730 --> 1:22:25.231
and their sacred Tree.

1:22:25.774 --> 1:22:26.900
He cursed Aguirre.

1:22:27.025 --> 1:22:31.071
He cursed all of us, so that we could
never leave sight of the river again.

1:22:31.237 --> 1:22:33.031
Where did she go?
-She can't be far!

1:22:33.114 --> 1:22:36.743
Or the jungle would
take us back to it, for all eternity.

1:22:49.005 --> 1:22:51.091
FRANK: Aguirre hated me for betraying him.

1:22:51.257 --> 1:22:54.135
He found me over the years, and we fought.

1:22:56.179 --> 1:22:57.180
And fought again.

1:23:00.684 --> 1:23:02.477
FRANK: I got tired of being stabbed.

1:23:02.644 --> 1:23:05.480
So I made sure he would never hurt me
or anyone else again.

1:23:08.608 --> 1:23:10.151
I trapped them in a cave.

1:23:10.318 --> 1:23:11.361
The river!

1:23:11.444 --> 1:23:12.445
Where is it?

1:23:12.529 --> 1:23:15.115
Where the jungle
couldn't take them back to the river.

1:23:15.198 --> 1:23:16.449
We have to get out of here!

1:23:29.045 --> 1:23:31.172
Francisco, you will pay for this!

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:37.053
And for 300 years,
the jungle ravaged their bodies.

1:23:37.137 --> 1:23:39.305
Turning them into
the monsters they are today.

1:23:41.016 --> 1:23:42.851
I don't know how they got free,

1:23:43.643 --> 1:23:45.228
but I was safe for a long time.

1:23:45.979 --> 1:23:47.105
What did you do?

1:23:47.188 --> 1:23:49.941
Well, I made the best of it.
I built a town.

1:23:50.567 --> 1:23:51.735
And that was fun.

1:23:53.570 --> 1:23:54.571
Made some friends.

1:23:56.531 --> 1:23:58.158
Lost some friends.

1:24:00.660 --> 1:24:02.704
That's when I decided
to search for the Tears of the Moon.

1:24:04.456 --> 1:24:05.874
I built a boat.

1:24:08.543 --> 1:24:11.796
And I named her
after the goddess of the moon, Quila.

1:24:13.006 --> 1:24:15.675
I charted every inch of this river,
searching.

1:24:17.093 --> 1:24:18.136
Till I finally gave up.

1:24:18.553 --> 1:24:20.472
And since I could never
leave sight of the river,

1:24:20.638 --> 1:24:22.974
I started giving
jungle cruises to tourists.

1:24:23.141 --> 1:24:25.310
-All that time, all alone...
-

1:24:25.393 --> 1:24:28.104
Well, not entirely alone, of course.

1:24:28.188 --> 1:24:29.189
That's right.

1:24:29.272 --> 1:24:32.317
Over the years, I would find strays
that needed someone.

1:24:32.484 --> 1:24:34.944
The next, after the next, after the next.

1:24:35.445 --> 1:24:37.238
And la próxima, la próxima...

1:24:37.322 --> 1:24:38.656
LILY: La próxima?
FRANK: Proxima, yes,

1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:40.408
-I name 'em all Proxima.
-Oh, la próxima.

1:24:41.534 --> 1:24:43.453
Oh, but don't worry,
you're my favorite girl.

1:24:45.330 --> 1:24:47.624
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1:24:47.707 --> 1:24:49.793
Life is but a dream

1:24:50.668 --> 1:24:52.670
You're meant to join in
on the second verse.

1:24:52.837 --> 1:24:54.672
I'll do it again, shall I?

1:24:55.757 --> 1:24:57.092
Row, row, row...

1:24:57.175 --> 1:24:59.135
I'm begging you, stop!

1:25:03.139 --> 1:25:04.390
MACGREGOR: Are we there yet?

1:25:04.474 --> 1:25:05.475
TRADER SAM: No!

1:25:09.104 --> 1:25:10.396
Got one.

1:25:10.563 --> 1:25:12.982
I spy with my little eye

1:25:13.149 --> 1:25:15.485
something beginning with...

1:25:18.988 --> 1:25:20.406
"S."

1:25:21.199 --> 1:25:23.284
Thought you might want a lift.

1:25:24.577 --> 1:25:25.578
Hey!

1:25:25.662 --> 1:25:28.498
TRADER SAM: I don't take lifts
from strangers.

1:25:28.748 --> 1:25:29.874
Cup of tea?

1:25:33.128 --> 1:25:36.965
So, how do you enjoy this
jungle?

1:25:37.298 --> 1:25:38.633
I beg your pardon?

1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:39.926
This jungle.

1:25:40.218 --> 1:25:42.178
-Yeah, sorry?
-The jungle.

1:25:42.262 --> 1:25:43.263
Try it slower.

1:25:43.346 --> 1:25:44.347
The jungle.

1:25:44.430 --> 1:25:45.515
Could you pop it in a sentence?

1:25:45.598 --> 1:25:48.935
The trees, the bugs... The... The jungle.

1:25:49.018 --> 1:25:50.645
-The jungle?
-Yes. That is what I said.

1:25:50.812 --> 1:25:52.397
-Right.
-How do you enjoy it?

1:25:52.564 --> 1:25:53.690
It's actually rather grown on me.

1:25:53.857 --> 1:25:55.525
I don't care anymore.

1:25:56.693 --> 1:25:58.736
Sir, we have arrived at the target.

1:25:59.195 --> 1:26:01.906
Ah. Time to make a deal.

1:26:04.367 --> 1:26:06.369
Look, right through here.

1:26:07.787 --> 1:26:10.748
You see the peaceful Puka Michuna tribe?

1:26:10.915 --> 1:26:14.377
With the touch of this button here,

1:26:14.544 --> 1:26:17.672
I could end 400 innocent lives.

1:26:17.839 --> 1:26:21.968
Their only crime being
that they are still living.

1:26:22.135 --> 1:26:26.222
Your sister and the Arrowhead were here.
Now, I need to know where she is going.

1:26:26.389 --> 1:26:27.557
The choice is yours.

1:26:27.724 --> 1:26:31.019
Do they live or do they die?

1:26:34.564 --> 1:26:36.024
FRANK: Let me help you.
LILY: No, it's my turn.

1:26:36.107 --> 1:26:38.526
-FRANK: Okay. You gotta listen to her.
-

1:26:38.610 --> 1:26:40.612
-It's perfect.
-Pretty good.

1:26:40.778 --> 1:26:42.906
Yeah. Now we can just cruise.

1:26:43.531 --> 1:26:44.949
-

1:26:49.662 --> 1:26:51.873
Do you know how many years
people have been looking for that?

1:26:51.956 --> 1:26:53.583
-This old thing?
-Yeah. That old thing.

1:26:53.666 --> 1:26:55.126
How is it that you turn up with it?

1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:56.961
Stole it.

1:26:57.045 --> 1:26:58.087
You stole it?

1:26:59.130 --> 1:27:01.216
Liberated it. How about that?

1:27:01.299 --> 1:27:02.300
Okay.

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:08.640
I've searched for this thing for so long,
but I'm pretty sure it belongs to you.

1:27:14.729 --> 1:27:16.731
What are you gonna do
when you find the Tree?

1:27:18.524 --> 1:27:19.984
Lift the curse.

1:27:20.568 --> 1:27:22.445
And what will happen to you?

1:27:22.737 --> 1:27:23.738
Well...

1:27:25.907 --> 1:27:28.159
I get to make a choice.

1:27:29.827 --> 1:27:31.829
And I choose to rest.

1:27:34.332 --> 1:27:35.375
Hey, Lily, look.

1:27:35.833 --> 1:27:39.045
Everything that you see
that's new in this world,

1:27:39.462 --> 1:27:42.382
I've seen hundreds of thousands of times.

1:27:43.883 --> 1:27:47.011
Yes, but none of it has been meaningful.

1:27:53.559 --> 1:27:56.437
All right. Where are they?

1:27:58.731 --> 1:28:01.067
I don't actually recognize the specific...

1:28:01.150 --> 1:28:02.277
Where?
-There.

1:28:08.491 --> 1:28:09.492
I think you got it.

1:28:10.576 --> 1:28:12.787
JOACHIM: The Tree is here
and will be ours.

1:28:12.954 --> 1:28:18.209
I cannot share my discoveries
with their masters.

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:20.837
You've been down here a while?

1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:41.316
LILY: This has got to be "water to stone."

1:28:46.946 --> 1:28:48.656
Do you think that we climb?

1:28:54.912 --> 1:28:56.664
I don't think we're meant to go up.

1:29:01.210 --> 1:29:02.378
We're in luck.

1:29:02.462 --> 1:29:04.255
There's a chamber down there
with a lever in it.

1:29:04.339 --> 1:29:05.798
I think pulling it is the key.

1:29:05.882 --> 1:29:06.883
LILY: That's wonderful!

1:29:06.966 --> 1:29:08.301
FRANK: It's wonderful. It's fantastic.

1:29:08.384 --> 1:29:11.888
Only problem is that
the ancients who built all of this

1:29:12.055 --> 1:29:14.515
were on average narrower.

1:29:16.059 --> 1:29:18.644
-Mm-hmm.
-So, it's a great time for you

1:29:18.728 --> 1:29:20.521
to take the finest bath in all Brazil.

1:29:20.605 --> 1:29:22.690
-No, no, no. Frank, Frank, please!
-Yes. Pants, listen...

1:29:22.774 --> 1:29:24.734
I cannot swim, Frank.
That is not something I can do.

1:29:24.817 --> 1:29:25.818
You've never tried.

1:29:25.902 --> 1:29:27.487
It's not about trying.
I have this very deep fear.

1:29:27.570 --> 1:29:28.738
FRANK: I'll do all the swimming.

1:29:28.821 --> 1:29:29.989
-Frank, please.
-Listen... Look,

1:29:30.073 --> 1:29:31.366
I can't do this without you.

1:29:31.741 --> 1:29:32.992
I need you.

1:29:34.285 --> 1:29:35.787
You have to trust me.

1:29:37.914 --> 1:29:39.374
No, no. Frank, Frank, Frank, please.

1:29:39.457 --> 1:29:40.792
I thought you might, uh...

1:29:40.875 --> 1:29:42.627
Just turn around
and look at the waterfall, Skippy.

1:29:42.710 --> 1:29:45.088
-All right? Please.
-Fine. Whew.

1:29:47.632 --> 1:29:48.800
Don't look.

1:29:49.634 --> 1:29:51.844
Are you wearing pants under your pants?

1:29:52.470 --> 1:29:53.888
-Yes.
-Oh, my God! Frank!

1:29:53.971 --> 1:29:55.014
It's okay. It's okay.

1:29:55.098 --> 1:29:56.182
-Here we go.
-I'm not... No, no!

1:29:56.265 --> 1:29:58.267
Wait a minute!
Something just touched my foot, Frank!

1:29:58.351 --> 1:30:00.645
It's okay, it's okay. It was my foot.

1:30:00.728 --> 1:30:01.854
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:30:01.938 --> 1:30:03.314
-I'm very scared.
-Okay. I got you.

1:30:03.398 --> 1:30:04.899
It's okay. Breathe.

1:30:05.608 --> 1:30:07.110
-Ready? Okay.
-Yes.

1:32:35.007 --> 1:32:36.008
Lily!

1:32:37.093 --> 1:32:38.302
Lily, come on, come on.

1:32:38.386 --> 1:32:39.762
Come on. Lily, come on.

1:32:39.845 --> 1:32:41.764
Come on. Come on, Lily.

1:32:43.432 --> 1:32:45.518
-What is the matter with you, Frank?

1:32:45.601 --> 1:32:46.852
-You're alive!
-How could you leave me?

1:32:46.936 --> 1:32:49.063
I didn't leave you.
There was a lot of fish down there that...

1:32:49.146 --> 1:32:50.731
What? Fish? Frank...

1:32:50.898 --> 1:32:52.191
There were lot of piranha,
they were coming after...

1:32:52.275 --> 1:32:54.527
-I saved you. Look.
-Don't even look at me.

1:32:54.694 --> 1:32:55.778
Fine.

1:33:13.754 --> 1:33:15.881
"Turn water to stone..."

1:33:19.427 --> 1:33:21.387
FRANK: After 400 years...

1:33:21.929 --> 1:33:23.431
I found it.

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:25.641
We found it.

1:33:31.355 --> 1:33:32.648
Now you can be the Darwin of flowers.

1:33:32.815 --> 1:33:35.735
The petal's right there,
you can be free. You can...

1:33:35.818 --> 1:33:37.445
I mean, it's not like
the river's not beautiful,

1:33:37.528 --> 1:33:38.779
but you can go anywhere

1:33:38.863 --> 1:33:41.365
and you can see the world.
You can come to London.

1:33:41.449 --> 1:33:43.284
I'm from London. I could show it to you.

1:33:43.367 --> 1:33:45.620
I even have a motor car.
I could be like your skipper,

1:33:45.703 --> 1:33:47.955
Skippy... If you want.

1:33:48.372 --> 1:33:50.791
Lily, I would love
to do all that with you.

1:33:51.334 --> 1:33:52.960
But I've made up my mind.

1:33:53.628 --> 1:33:56.213
There is no London for me after this.

1:33:58.174 --> 1:33:59.717
There's no motor car.

1:34:06.515 --> 1:34:07.683
I'm ready.

1:34:08.059 --> 1:34:09.060
No.

1:34:09.143 --> 1:34:12.730
It's my time. It was my time long ago.

1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:22.865
No. No, I don't accept it.
You could have one more life.

1:34:22.948 --> 1:34:24.116
Luckily for me, it's my choice.

1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:27.912
Well, it shouldn't be,
because you have very poor judgement.

1:34:28.079 --> 1:34:30.956
But you have your world to go back to.
It's your world.

1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:33.459
But it could be yours, too.

1:34:37.338 --> 1:34:40.257
It could be that
one person's world enough.

1:34:53.979 --> 1:34:55.272
Could be.

1:34:59.276 --> 1:35:01.195
-Lily...
-

1:35:04.407 --> 1:35:05.408
Lily.

1:35:15.209 --> 1:35:16.210
Hello.

1:35:16.752 --> 1:35:20.131
Small chance I told a madman with a cannon
where to find you.

1:35:30.641 --> 1:35:32.601
JOACHIM: Oh, so, we finally meet.

1:35:34.979 --> 1:35:38.065
Wow. Big, strong boy, huh?

1:35:40.276 --> 1:35:43.571
Go to the bridge. Go.

1:35:48.868 --> 1:35:52.872
I believe this belongs to you.

1:35:55.541 --> 1:35:58.711
Now, the Arrowhead, please?

1:36:01.046 --> 1:36:02.047
-LILY: No, no, no.

1:36:09.472 --> 1:36:12.183
Such an imaginative woman

1:36:12.349 --> 1:36:15.770
seeking the Tears of the Moon
to share with the scientific community

1:36:15.853 --> 1:36:20.191
that won't even permit you, Fräulein,
to sit among them.

1:36:20.900 --> 1:36:23.944
To put that tremendous power

1:36:24.111 --> 1:36:27.490
into the hands of the masses
would be pure madness.

1:36:27.656 --> 1:36:31.494
When I could use the Tears,
not only to win the war,

1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:35.790
but to reign for all generations to come.

1:36:36.290 --> 1:36:37.625
Take them away.

1:36:42.546 --> 1:36:46.425
Eyes ahead.
Navigate to the Tree.

1:37:44.900 --> 1:37:47.570
This Tree is long dead.

1:37:47.736 --> 1:37:51.365
You know more about the Tears of the Moon
than anyone, so...

1:37:52.032 --> 1:37:55.244
you know how to make it bloom.
You will do this for me.

1:37:55.411 --> 1:37:56.829
And when you have what you want,

1:37:57.162 --> 1:37:59.248
what's to stop you from killing us then?

1:37:59.623 --> 1:38:01.417
I could kill you now.

1:38:02.918 --> 1:38:03.961
I'll do it.

1:38:04.128 --> 1:38:07.590
If you promise to let them go
and give me one single petal in return.

1:38:07.756 --> 1:38:11.051
I know the myths and the ancient ways
as if I've lived them myself.

1:38:11.218 --> 1:38:12.219
Frank, do not...

1:38:12.303 --> 1:38:15.222
FRANK: If anyone here is going to bring
the Tears of the Moon, it's me.

1:38:17.558 --> 1:38:21.604
If you can make
the Tree bloom, you may have your petal.

1:38:21.687 --> 1:38:22.938
You have my word.

1:38:25.733 --> 1:38:26.901
There's no other way.

1:38:27.067 --> 1:38:29.069
But the little brother stays on the boat.

1:38:29.236 --> 1:38:31.155
Little brother? I have a name.

1:38:56.013 --> 1:38:57.556
Go ahead.

1:39:12.363 --> 1:39:14.073
The Arrowhead should fit here.

1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:17.660
-You better go help him. Go.
-LILY: No.

1:39:18.285 --> 1:39:19.703
No?

1:39:20.955 --> 1:39:23.415
-

1:39:23.499 --> 1:39:25.250
I'll do it if you give me a petal as well.

1:39:26.418 --> 1:39:29.588
If I give you a petal as well...

1:39:29.755 --> 1:39:32.466
One petal. Not two. You must choose.

1:39:32.633 --> 1:39:35.094
What do you think, Muscles?

1:39:35.970 --> 1:39:39.682
Will you sacrifice your petal for her?

1:39:41.767 --> 1:39:43.227
She'd have to kill me first.

1:39:51.276 --> 1:39:52.903
-Done.
-Done.

1:40:00.869 --> 1:40:02.496
"Broken-hearted warrior

1:40:02.830 --> 1:40:05.207
"climbed to the highest peak

1:40:05.374 --> 1:40:07.793
"and shot his arrow into the Moon.

1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:11.338
"From there, the Moon learned real pain
and began to weep.

1:40:11.505 --> 1:40:14.466
"Where the Tears fell
grew a sacred Tree..."

1:40:19.054 --> 1:40:21.557
Rum-pum-pum-pum...

1:40:25.728 --> 1:40:26.729
Give me the Arrow.

1:40:32.985 --> 1:40:33.986
Hurry up!

1:40:35.946 --> 1:40:38.449
-

1:40:42.494 --> 1:40:45.497
Trader Sam said we would need
to fix a broken heart.

1:40:45.664 --> 1:40:48.542
It's not an Arrowhead, it's a heart.

1:40:49.084 --> 1:40:50.836
You can't mend a heart that isn't...

1:40:50.919 --> 1:40:52.337
...broken.

1:42:37.818 --> 1:42:39.278
I'll take that petal now.

1:43:00.215 --> 1:43:01.884
"Under the crying Moon..."

1:43:02.593 --> 1:43:06.013
We must pluck the petals before it sets.
Go! Hurry!

1:43:31.079 --> 1:43:32.080
Every time.

1:43:32.206 --> 1:43:33.207
Sorry.

1:43:39.004 --> 1:43:40.505
-

1:43:47.304 --> 1:43:48.847
-Shoot!
-

1:43:54.144 --> 1:43:55.854
-Good murder cat.
-

1:43:59.107 --> 1:44:00.234
Where's Lily?

1:44:00.943 --> 1:44:01.944
Up there.

1:44:02.861 --> 1:44:04.780
Here we go again.

1:44:10.786 --> 1:44:11.995
MACGREGOR: The Moon's setting.

1:44:12.162 --> 1:44:13.205
The Tree is dying.

1:44:23.674 --> 1:44:24.716
Whoa.

1:44:34.393 --> 1:44:35.394
Come on.

1:44:40.315 --> 1:44:41.316
Yes!

1:44:45.779 --> 1:44:47.239
-

1:44:47.322 --> 1:44:49.032
-Lily!

1:44:59.501 --> 1:45:04.756
This is a amusingly familiar
situation, no?

1:45:06.216 --> 1:45:07.801
Give me that petal.

1:45:08.010 --> 1:45:10.387
-No.
-You are about to die

1:45:10.554 --> 1:45:14.474
one way or another,
but if you do not give me that petal,

1:45:14.641 --> 1:45:16.184
so, too, will your brother.

1:45:16.810 --> 1:45:20.897
His will be much more slower.

1:45:22.316 --> 1:45:23.817
Give me that petal.

1:45:33.493 --> 1:45:36.330
Just one is enough. Give it to me.

1:45:40.792 --> 1:45:42.669
Never.
Frank!

1:45:42.919 --> 1:45:43.920
Let go of me!

1:45:48.925 --> 1:45:50.344
Take the wheel. Hold her steady.

1:46:13.075 --> 1:46:14.743
You're the best cat I've ever had.

1:46:19.581 --> 1:46:20.749
Get off!

1:46:23.543 --> 1:46:25.754
It looks like
you haven't been very nice...

1:46:25.921 --> 1:46:27.881
to my little friends.

1:46:28.048 --> 1:46:30.008
Aguirre,
help me to get the petal!

1:46:30.092 --> 1:46:33.470
I'll give you anything you want!
Money, ships...

1:46:33.845 --> 1:46:34.971
Spain!

1:46:35.180 --> 1:46:37.265
Royalty is not to be trusted.

1:46:43.313 --> 1:46:45.023
Aguirre, the woman in pants...

1:46:47.651 --> 1:46:48.902
Get her!

1:46:55.659 --> 1:46:56.910
Aguirre!

1:46:59.246 --> 1:47:00.414
Francisco has the petal!

1:47:03.250 --> 1:47:04.292
Stop him!

1:47:10.882 --> 1:47:12.592
-This is where you get off.
-What?

1:47:13.677 --> 1:47:15.720
Tell Lily she would've been
world enough for me.

1:47:15.804 --> 1:47:16.805
Where are you going?

1:47:16.888 --> 1:47:20.684
Proxima. You protect him,
you're in charge. Go.

1:47:22.060 --> 1:47:23.937
-Goodbye, girl.

1:47:37.451 --> 1:47:40.454
Let's give 'em one last cruise,
mi buena niña.

1:47:41.121 --> 1:47:42.497
There's only one way to end this.

1:47:42.664 --> 1:47:43.874
Come and get me.

1:47:48.503 --> 1:47:50.297
-Lily.

1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:13.612
He's going to crash.

1:48:15.655 --> 1:48:17.491
No, he's gonna block the river.

1:48:43.058 --> 1:48:44.059
Francisco!

1:48:44.726 --> 1:48:45.977
Give me the petal!

1:48:46.061 --> 1:48:47.729
He has the petal in his pocket!

1:48:49.105 --> 1:48:50.607
Enough is enough!

1:48:50.982 --> 1:48:53.276
It's now time for you to die!

1:48:53.735 --> 1:48:54.778
Right.

1:48:54.861 --> 1:48:56.780
I think we've had quite enough of you.

1:49:01.910 --> 1:49:03.495
-Good night.
-

1:49:13.380 --> 1:49:15.507
Not exactly what I intended.

1:49:27.852 --> 1:49:30.730
-A brother's blade cuts deepest.

1:49:38.613 --> 1:49:40.782
Give me the petal.

1:49:40.949 --> 1:49:42.325
MACGREGOR: He told me to tell you,

1:49:42.409 --> 1:49:44.369
you would have been world enough for him.

1:49:45.495 --> 1:49:46.955
Where's the petal?

1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:53.878
-

1:49:54.212 --> 1:49:55.547
I'm sorry, old friend.

1:49:56.089 --> 1:49:57.674
MACGREGOR: He wanted you to have it.

1:49:59.718 --> 1:50:01.636
Stop the boat! Stop it!

1:50:01.803 --> 1:50:03.305
-Frank.
-Wait.

1:50:04.848 --> 1:50:06.308
Frank, no!

1:50:06.474 --> 1:50:08.602
No!

1:50:43.762 --> 1:50:45.055
Francisco, what have you done?

1:50:45.555 --> 1:50:47.724
This is worse than death! This is torture!

1:51:30.475 --> 1:51:35.063
Oh, you are the most infuriating man
I've ever met.

1:51:45.615 --> 1:51:46.991
Lily...

1:53:13.453 --> 1:53:14.454
Frank.

1:53:32.514 --> 1:53:33.515
Frank!

1:53:43.274 --> 1:53:44.359
Oh, you're bleeding.

1:53:44.442 --> 1:53:45.735
That hurts.

1:53:45.819 --> 1:53:46.903
-It does?
-Yeah.

1:53:46.986 --> 1:53:47.987
Well, that's good.

1:53:48.655 --> 1:53:49.823
I can't believe you shot me.

1:53:49.906 --> 1:53:51.407
-I know.
-Twice.

1:53:51.574 --> 1:53:52.951
I know, but you didn't go down
the first time.

1:53:53.034 --> 1:53:54.661
You should've just gone down.

1:54:03.002 --> 1:54:04.921
You're both my world.

1:54:05.255 --> 1:54:07.215
-

1:54:29.070 --> 1:54:30.613
-

1:54:38.830 --> 1:54:40.123
Well, well, well...

1:54:40.206 --> 1:54:41.541
Nilo. Now you have all the boats.

1:54:41.624 --> 1:54:43.751
-Take care of her.

1:54:44.127 --> 1:54:45.587
-

1:54:48.756 --> 1:54:51.968
MACGREGOR: I stand before you today
to tell you about the Tears of the Moon.

1:54:52.176 --> 1:54:53.469
The legend is true.

1:54:55.096 --> 1:54:59.809
Our party traveled further into the Amazon
than any expedition had previously dared.

1:55:01.603 --> 1:55:04.731
On our trip,
the lines between life and death,

1:55:04.814 --> 1:55:06.691
past and present, vanished.

1:55:07.901 --> 1:55:10.236
I witnessed things not to be believed.

1:55:10.653 --> 1:55:13.948
Enchanted dolphins
that could haunt one's dreams.

1:55:14.282 --> 1:55:15.867
Undead conquistadors,

1:55:15.950 --> 1:55:19.370
cursed as prisoners of the jungle
for nearly 400 years.

1:55:20.038 --> 1:55:22.081
A tribe whose chief, a lady...

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.836
No! It actually worked rather well.

1:55:27.462 --> 1:55:29.839
My point is, this was a journey

1:55:29.923 --> 1:55:32.467
the likes of which
this society has never seen.

1:55:32.884 --> 1:55:35.929
An adventure truly worthy
of this association.

1:55:36.846 --> 1:55:41.017
But is this association
worthy of our great adventure?

1:55:41.559 --> 1:55:44.270
You see, we didn't seek
the Tears of the Moon

1:55:44.354 --> 1:55:46.481
so that we could be written up
in some journal

1:55:46.564 --> 1:55:48.232
for a load of crusty old farts.

1:55:49.943 --> 1:55:53.237
My sister, who just made
full professor at Cambridge,

1:55:53.404 --> 1:55:55.657
has asked me to respectfully reject

1:55:55.740 --> 1:55:58.201
your invitation of membership
on her behalf.

1:55:58.368 --> 1:56:01.037
Which I will do. Just not respectfully.

1:56:01.204 --> 1:56:03.957
Gentlemen, you can take your invitation

1:56:04.499 --> 1:56:07.335
and you can shove it up your association.

1:56:09.796 --> 1:56:11.506
MAN: How dare you!

1:56:17.512 --> 1:56:19.639
Ready for your first driving lesson?

1:56:20.181 --> 1:56:21.766
I think so, Pants.

1:56:23.184 --> 1:56:26.562
I hope you know what you're
getting yourself into here, Frank.

1:56:26.729 --> 1:56:27.730
A car.

1:56:27.814 --> 1:56:29.107
LILY: Oh, your jokes.

1:56:29.190 --> 1:56:31.150
-They will be the death of me.
-

1:56:31.234 --> 1:56:33.778
They are absolutely exhausting.

1:56:36.114 --> 1:56:37.323
Wow, Lily.

1:56:37.490 --> 1:56:39.534
-Did you like it?
-It was good.

1:56:39.617 --> 1:56:40.702
-Yeah.
-Are you proud?

1:56:40.785 --> 1:56:42.203
-Oh! Frank, Frank, Frank!

1:56:42.286 --> 1:56:43.746
-Oh, my goodness!
-FRANK: Okay, I got it.

1:56:43.830 --> 1:56:45.081
Frank, for goodness' sake!

1:56:45.164 --> 1:56:47.083
FRANK: I got it, I got it.
LILY: Turn now! Turn now! Turn now!

1:56:47.166 --> 1:56:49.502
FRANK: I got it all under control, Pants.

2:06:59.486 --> 2:07:01.488
