00:00.160 --> 00:02.150
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.380 --> 00:03.790
Will you go to the prom with me?

00:03.800 --> 00:05.470
Yes, I would love to go with you.

00:05.480 --> 00:08.150
You don't wear a tuxedo to a funeral. You wear one to a prom.

00:08.189 --> 00:10.020
Didn't you once tell me that going to a prom

00:10.055 --> 00:11.650
would be a fate worse than death?

00:11.720 --> 00:14.420
I'm not asking you to go to prom 'cause there's no one else.

00:14.530 --> 00:17.910
I'm asking 'cause you are the only one I want to go with.

00:17.945 --> 00:19.680
Are you telling me there are problems with the prom?

00:19.930 --> 00:22.540
Prom committee's become a nightmare of mix-ups with the decorators

00:22.575 --> 00:23.840
and arguments with the caterers.

00:23.910 --> 00:25.780
I want prom to be this perfect night with Kyle,

00:25.815 --> 00:28.230
and all I can think about is table and chair rentals and non-refundable

00:28.430 --> 00:29.120
deposits.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.620
Well, you should enter this in the contest.

00:30.655 --> 00:31.390
I suppose.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.390
Although I'm sure three-chord trite piece of crap will win.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.600
Brian told me all about the girl in the pictures, Sarah.

00:36.630 --> 00:39.650
He said he created me from sarah's genetic material after she died.

00:39.770 --> 00:41.710
- My name is Sarah.
- She's alive.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.940
She wants to meet me, right?

00:43.975 --> 00:46.130
- Sarah said she'd be here.
- She's not coming.

00:46.490 --> 00:48.840
- I'm alone!
- You're not alone.

00:51.110 --> 00:52.000
Jessi!

00:52.760 --> 00:53.890
Her heart has stopped.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.420
It's okay now. I'm here.

00:59.550 --> 01:02.440
The people in Latnok aren't bad, they're simply scientists

01:02.510 --> 01:04.360
with a very clinical point of view.

01:05.379 --> 01:06.310
He's incredible.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.790
More than we'd ever dreamed we'd see in our lifetimes.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.720
What are you watching?

01:27.270 --> 01:28.890
"If you're not back by midnight,

01:29.270 --> 01:30.750
you won't be coming home."

01:33.840 --> 01:35.090
That's not good.

01:36.590 --> 01:39.290
Why on earth would you watch prom night? It's scary.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.760
It's video research for the prom.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.600
You're researching the prom?

01:43.630 --> 01:45.100
And it led you to prom night?

01:45.260 --> 01:46.730
It had the most straightforward title.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.620
What else did you look at?

01:49.620 --> 01:53.790
44 movies, 2.6 million websites, and 37 young-adult novels.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.870
"Prom is the most romantic moment in a young person's life.

01:57.110 --> 01:58.770
it's the culmination of adolescence

01:58.800 --> 02:00.890
and marks the beginning of the journey into adulthood."

02:01.110 --> 02:04.290
Pricilla's perfect prom. I love that book!

02:05.650 --> 02:07.640
I wasn't always a cynic.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.160
I know how important it is to Amanda.

02:10.590 --> 02:11.690
I can't let her down.

02:12.020 --> 02:13.530
I just need the perfect plan.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.650
There's really no formula for perfection.

02:17.110 --> 02:19.000
Let me let you in on a little life secret.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.380
The more you expect, the more you get let down.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.250
Pricilla's prom was a disaster.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.910
Her date leaves her at the end of the night.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.600
Two chapters later, he's gay.

02:28.030 --> 02:29.200
Nice pep talk.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.430
Just focus on having fun, and you will.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.380
Don't let your expectations get the best of you.

02:36.730 --> 02:37.840
Expectations.

02:38.140 --> 02:40.450
To them, the word implied inevitable failure.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.280
Was it wrong to have faith that things could turn out well?

02:50.660 --> 02:53.550
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 23:
I've Had The Time Of My Life</font>

02:55.440 --> 02:57.600
I'm not sure which was more difficult to process,

02:57.635 --> 02:59.490
the news that Sarah's alive

03:00.220 --> 03:02.080
or that you brought Jessi back from the dead.

03:02.690 --> 03:04.120
Has Sarah tried to contact you?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.620
No. And she won't.

03:08.050 --> 03:10.190
She's put her past behind her, Kyle,

03:11.130 --> 03:13.050
and I've accepted that I need to do the same.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.410
Your leg is better.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.550
Yeah. It's good as new.

03:19.470 --> 03:21.160
Just in time for me to move on.

03:22.350 --> 03:23.170
Move on?

03:25.940 --> 03:27.690
Kyle, I wasn't pleased that Latnok

03:27.725 --> 03:30.580
was willing to test Jessi like some kind of a laboratory rat.

03:31.490 --> 03:34.570
It made me realize just how out of touch we all are with our own humanity.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.890
So I need a break from the Latnok community.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.960
And I asked them to give you a break.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.200
For me?

03:44.880 --> 03:46.170
I haven't even met them.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.130
Well, they've been watching you for a while,

03:49.430 --> 03:53.100
waiting for an opportunity to take a larger role in your development.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.000
They've been watching me?

03:55.310 --> 03:57.460
Believe me, I wasn't happy about it either.

03:58.140 --> 04:00.060
But I've made it very clear to them

04:00.190 --> 04:03.030
that you have a whole lifetime to be extraordinary.

04:03.510 --> 04:07.350
Now is the time for you to be... ordinary.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.410
So I'd ask you to come along with me,

04:11.890 --> 04:14.290
but I think we both know what your answer would be.

04:16.260 --> 04:18.959
It doesn't bother you that I wouldn't want to leave the Tragers?

04:21.110 --> 04:22.510
I'll be back one day

04:22.930 --> 04:25.200
when it's time for us to resume out training.

04:26.190 --> 04:27.260
In the meantime,

04:28.500 --> 04:31.220
I want you to stay here and enjoy what I never had.

04:32.850 --> 04:33.720
What's that?

04:35.210 --> 04:36.100
A life.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.110
My sunset backdrop is a no-show,

04:40.145 --> 04:41.940
so I don't think this gym is gonna be transformed

04:41.975 --> 04:43.510
into the ocean paradise that I want.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.740
We still have time. Maybe there's something--

04:45.775 --> 04:47.200
Kyle, really, I know I made a huge deal

04:47.235 --> 04:48.740
about the whole magic of prom,

04:48.775 --> 04:51.640
but I'll be happy if it wasn't a huge disaster.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.120
This would be so much more fun if we were allowed to inhale.

04:55.220 --> 04:56.710
Will you guys please get him out of here?

04:57.180 --> 04:58.650
Amanda, I don't think I should leave you here

04:58.685 --> 04:59.900
to deal with this by yourself.

04:59.935 --> 05:02.060
Kyle, I have 27 perfectly capable people

05:02.095 --> 05:03.670
to help me hang lame streamers.

05:03.690 --> 05:05.940
I, for one, am happy to pass the helium torch.

05:06.050 --> 05:09.310
Good. Save your energy for the end of tonight.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.730
Your sugar mama's got big plans for you.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.010
Is there anything else I can do?

05:14.290 --> 05:16.890
- No.
- That was a lie.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.380
You've just been busted by the human lie detector.

05:19.660 --> 05:20.950
Fess up, little lady.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.470
- Okay, if you really want to help.
- I really want to.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.760
You can pick up my dress from the cleaners.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.940
There was this whole-- well, it's a long story, but--

05:29.975 --> 05:31.190
I'd be happy to.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.230
You don't have to bring everything.

05:36.410 --> 05:39.160
We can start fresh. I can get you some new clothes.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.220
Why?

05:41.240 --> 05:44.290
Because of the memories of Taylor not being exactly--

05:44.325 --> 05:45.350
A good father?

05:48.100 --> 05:49.240
I'm glad he left.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.740
But I like my clothes.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.030
I even like this room.

05:54.050 --> 05:56.170
It's the first place I've ever been able to call mine.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.480
Now this brings back memories.

06:00.900 --> 06:01.650
Good ones?

06:02.920 --> 06:04.220
Good at the time.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.200
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth having good memories.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.550
When things go wrong, you almost resent the happy moments,

06:12.700 --> 06:13.930
like they failed you.

06:14.860 --> 06:16.500
That picture reminds me of Kyle

06:17.340 --> 06:19.230
and everything we've been through together.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.070
I hope I never have to resent that.

06:23.170 --> 06:24.840
Yeah, I hope you never have to.

06:28.710 --> 06:31.590
Jessi, I think we should leave Seattle.

06:32.610 --> 06:33.680
Where would we go?

06:33.790 --> 06:36.780
I don't know. Somewhere, anywhere else.

06:37.650 --> 06:38.790
Because of Latnok?

06:39.230 --> 06:42.060
I don't know. Maybe.

06:42.940 --> 06:45.330
Seattle was a cage for me for 20 years,

06:45.365 --> 06:48.490
and being back here, I feel trapped.

06:51.270 --> 06:52.580
Would that be okay with you?

06:53.060 --> 06:54.970
Yeah. Of course.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.500
Andy says she has big plans for me.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.320
You know what that means, don't you?

07:00.360 --> 07:01.700
This dress is silver.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.120
Dude, you already said that. It's not important.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.490
It's supposed to be yellow.

07:05.950 --> 07:08.080
We're talking about me now, dude.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.500
Sorry. What does it mean?

07:10.870 --> 07:12.890
It means I need to be ready to round the bases.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.210
Round the bases?

07:14.650 --> 07:16.540
Prom night often results in extra bases,

07:16.550 --> 07:19.000
and considering I slid in to second with Andy a few weeks ago,

07:19.150 --> 07:21.840
I'm looking at third base, if not an inside-the-park homer.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.960
Josh, you should know by now, I have no idea what you're talking about.

07:24.995 --> 07:26.700
Sex. I'm talking about sex.

07:28.570 --> 07:30.760
Yeah, and I've never... you know.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.650
- Had it.
- With another person.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.330
Never mind.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.200
The importance of prom night sex was portrayed

07:39.235 --> 07:41.090
in 82% of the movies I watched.

07:41.125 --> 07:41.810
See?

07:41.930 --> 07:43.820
But since 17% of them also ended with

07:43.855 --> 07:45.420
young teens being fatally mutilated,

07:45.690 --> 07:47.580
I assumed it was a cinematic convention.

07:48.020 --> 07:48.920
Afraid not, buddy.

07:49.290 --> 07:50.780
For much of the adolescent universe,

07:50.815 --> 07:52.620
the whole dance is basically just foreplay.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.860
Is sex part of the perfect prom equation?

07:55.895 --> 07:57.890
Don't you worry about it.

07:57.925 --> 07:59.640
Something tells me that sex isn't part of

07:59.675 --> 08:01.990
yours and Amanda's G-rated prom fantasy.

08:03.490 --> 08:04.300
What is it?

08:05.160 --> 08:05.970
Nothing.

08:08.970 --> 08:10.180
Uh, no.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.400
No line-dance songs. Come on.

08:12.790 --> 08:13.370
- What?
- Ah!

08:13.630 --> 08:15.980
- You know it's inevitable.
- Not if I can help it.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.130
Come on!

08:18.580 --> 08:19.990
It's a prom must-do.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.890
Yeah, then I think I must puke.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.470
Are you sure you don't want to just DJ the prom yourself?

08:26.560 --> 08:29.190
Please. Have you seen those geeks that DJ the proms?

08:29.225 --> 08:31.970
Ha ha ha! Hilarious.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.980
Besides, I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, remember?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.419
Oh, you mean the lyric you actually neglected

08:37.455 --> 08:38.940
to include in your theme song?

08:39.070 --> 08:40.049
It's been done.

08:40.809 --> 08:43.740
Besides, you and I both know that there's zero chance

08:43.775 --> 08:45.460
of winning that contest tonight,

08:45.570 --> 08:49.250
with my reedy voice and the 12th-rate acoustic recording.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.750
Wow. You're really not expecting much, are you?

08:52.470 --> 08:54.100
The thing about expectations--

08:55.390 --> 08:56.980
You know what? Forget it.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.050
I've already busted out that speech once today.

08:59.150 --> 09:01.030
So jaded for so young.

09:01.690 --> 09:03.560
Enough with the young already.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.340
What's all this?

09:08.730 --> 09:10.170
Amanda changed her dress,

09:10.190 --> 09:13.950
so the vest and the corsage I choose don't match unless I dye them.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.960
Well, can I help?

09:17.170 --> 09:18.410
I know this may surprise you,

09:18.445 --> 09:20.700
but I used to be kinda good at arts and crafts.

09:23.570 --> 09:25.910
I stripped the silver nitrate off some old rolls of film

09:25.945 --> 09:28.310
and combined it with aluminum potassium sulfate.

09:29.270 --> 09:32.340
But I'm having trouble stabilizing the polyvalent metal ions

09:32.375 --> 09:34.760
needed to act as a mortar to set the dye pigment.

09:35.590 --> 09:37.650
I once made a house out of popsicle sticks.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.870
The dye is too dark and won't stick properly to the fabric.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.040
Oh. Well, I'm sure Amanda will understand.

09:48.210 --> 09:50.890
She will understand. That's the problem.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.760
She's already given up hope of having a good prom,

09:53.860 --> 09:55.180
but she shouldn't.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.630
I just wanna make sure it's everything she wished for.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.810
Well, don't put too much pressure on yourself.

10:00.010 --> 10:03.180
Sometimes trying too hard to make things perfect can blow up in your face.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.110
- Hey.
- How are you?

10:16.880 --> 10:19.140
Alive... thanks to you.

10:23.470 --> 10:24.630
You've made a mess.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.220
I don't know why the formula didn't work.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.940
Let me see what I can do.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.590
What are you looking for?

10:44.190 --> 10:46.030
Adam said Latnok is watching me.

10:46.850 --> 10:49.500
He told them to stop, but I still feel like someone's out there.

10:49.660 --> 10:52.850
I think Latnok is creepy. So does Sarah.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.520
How have things been going with her?

10:58.960 --> 10:59.840
New.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.490
Exciting.

11:02.310 --> 11:03.500
A little scary.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.000
She wants to leave town.

11:07.190 --> 11:09.380
- Why?
- To start over.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.530
Jessi.

11:11.410 --> 11:12.530
No, it's okay.

11:13.370 --> 11:14.780
Sarah really wants this.

11:15.590 --> 11:16.880
Well, what do you want?

11:17.490 --> 11:18.870
I want what you have.

11:19.970 --> 11:20.980
A family.

11:22.910 --> 11:24.720
Have you told her that you'd rather stay?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.920
- No, I can't do that.
- Why not?

11:27.470 --> 11:29.370
Because what if she leaves anyway?

11:31.730 --> 11:32.490
Jessi...

11:34.410 --> 11:37.330
Not everyone who cares about you is going to disappoint you.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.440
All I know is I'm being given a chance to have a real life.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.620
I'm not gonna do anything to mess it up.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.660
You're missing about ten milligrams of nickel iodine.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.360
Oh, good. I need to talk to you.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.830
Now's not the best time, dad.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.910
Well, it's never an appropriate time for a man

12:02.270 --> 12:05.380
to warn his daughter not to get involved with his teaching assistant,

12:05.415 --> 12:06.530
and yet, here we are.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.090
I'm not getting involved with Mark.

12:09.670 --> 12:11.700
In case you haven't noticed, I'm in a towel

12:11.720 --> 12:13.710
Getting ready for prom with Declan.

12:14.090 --> 12:17.410
A much better age-appropriate, all-around good choice I'm thinking.

12:17.620 --> 12:21.060
My year of strumming sad chords was sponsored by Mr. Declan McDonough.

12:21.180 --> 12:24.080
Not to mention his role in my disappearing reappearing virtue.

12:24.180 --> 12:25.270
And about that--

12:25.600 --> 12:28.390
Don't worry, dad. Store's closed.

12:28.780 --> 12:29.710
What store?

12:30.430 --> 12:32.700
Tragerporium is locked tight.

12:32.735 --> 12:34.570
No weekend sales, no limited time offers.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.190
Security system's armed.

12:36.225 --> 12:38.030
Guard dogs are roaming the aisle.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.570
Of course we're still encouraging window shopping,

12:40.605 --> 12:41.990
cause you always wanna keep the public interested.

12:42.025 --> 12:44.000
But I can assure you that tonight will not be about sex.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.570
I thought prom was basically just foreplay

12:45.605 --> 12:47.080
for much of the adolescent universe.

12:47.115 --> 12:48.770
- Says who?
- Josh.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.480
- Josh?
- What's up?

12:51.130 --> 12:52.890
Not you, that's for sure.

12:53.460 --> 12:54.160
What?

12:54.195 --> 12:55.930
There'll be no sex had by you.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.700
Not... any of you.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.490
Not tonight, tomorrow, or hopefully in my lifetime.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.570
Smile.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.710
- What did you do?
- What? Is it that obvious?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.650
Last time you had that look,

13:18.685 --> 13:21.140
you realized Josh just found your old pot stash.

13:22.650 --> 13:25.500
Okay, so which parental sin did you commit?

13:25.750 --> 13:27.910
The "don't blow the sex talk" one.

13:27.945 --> 13:29.320
We already had that talk with Lori.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.330
I'm not talking about Lori, or Kyle either.

13:31.580 --> 13:32.450
Josh?

13:32.940 --> 13:34.540
Oh, Stephen, he's not ready.

13:34.550 --> 13:35.450
I know.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.800
Well, you have to go back up and talk to him again.

13:37.835 --> 13:39.250
- I know.
- So why aren't you moving?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.090
I don't know.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.820
You only have a small window of opportunity to correct this.

13:45.570 --> 13:46.590
I can't do it.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.820
Yes. Yes, you can.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.770
You can. You are a smart, educated,

13:51.980 --> 13:54.050
progressive, thoughtful man,

13:54.070 --> 13:56.200
and--and... an excellent father.

13:56.530 --> 13:57.970
Don't psych yourself out.

13:59.570 --> 14:00.380
Just go.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.720
Hey, it looks like all the stains came out.

14:07.370 --> 14:10.380
Thank you for coming over to help out.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.700
How can I pass up my last opportunity

14:12.730 --> 14:14.510
to prove that I'm smarter than you?

14:15.710 --> 14:16.800
Very funny.

14:18.690 --> 14:21.160
I'm not, you know, smarter.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.430
I just try harder to impress people.

14:25.340 --> 14:26.720
But you already knew that.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.310
You don't have to do that anymore.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.010
You never have to prove yourself to anyone ever again.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.080
If anything,

14:38.060 --> 14:40.050
people should start proving themselves to you.

14:40.670 --> 14:43.110
You really don't want to see me leave, do you?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.930
You're my friend, Jessi.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.430
I don't want to lose you.

15:01.330 --> 15:03.290
I have your dress. It's not yellow.

15:03.310 --> 15:06.240
I know, the dry cleaners accidentally shredded my original dress,

15:06.420 --> 15:08.270
so I had to make a last-minute switch.

15:08.530 --> 15:10.140
At least now I'll match the gym.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.730
How are things going down there?

15:12.090 --> 15:12.920
Almost done.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.170
But would you mind dropping the dress off at school?

15:15.320 --> 15:17.240
At the school? Won't you be home soon?

15:17.280 --> 15:18.970
I'm just taking some precautions.

15:18.990 --> 15:21.160
You know, in case the decorations committee hits a snag

15:21.195 --> 15:22.420
and I have to get ready here.

15:22.690 --> 15:23.920
I'm coming to help you.

15:23.955 --> 15:26.400
Kyle, don't. I'm dirty and a mess.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.350
And even though everything else is a bust right now,

15:28.385 --> 15:30.170
I don't want you to see me until I'm ready.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.700
Just send the dress.

15:31.735 --> 15:32.430
But I--

15:32.465 --> 15:33.670
Promise me you won't come in.

15:34.950 --> 15:35.810
I promise.

15:37.310 --> 15:38.000
Good.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.970
It's still wet.

15:48.230 --> 15:49.440
I'll take care of it.

15:50.490 --> 15:52.400
I should at least take it to her and explain.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.890
Kyle, you need to get ready.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.320
I'll finish the dress, and I'll take it to Amanda.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.020
It will all be okay.

16:01.590 --> 16:03.630
You want to do something nice for Amanda?

16:03.680 --> 16:06.640
No, but I'd like to do something nice for you.

16:11.980 --> 16:12.670
Come in.

16:15.830 --> 16:17.040
What's with the shades?

16:20.830 --> 16:23.590
All the makeup, like, ever, is on your face.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.690
I wanna look "va va voomy" for Josh,

16:25.725 --> 16:27.720
But I keep coming up with vampire clown whore.

16:28.410 --> 16:29.450
Can you help me?

16:29.840 --> 16:32.370
You have two moms. Doesn't one of them wear a little lip-gloss?

16:32.530 --> 16:35.890
My moms think that makeup is an ageist, sexist ploy

16:35.925 --> 16:38.240
to devalue the feminine form in its natural state

16:38.420 --> 16:41.560
perpetuating unrealistic myths and expectations.

16:42.350 --> 16:44.680
Yeah. Well... maybe it is.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
Come here.

17:11.150 --> 17:12.060
Nice job.

17:12.510 --> 17:14.050
I downloaded an instructional diagram.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.250
Stephen will be disappointed he wasn't able to help you.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.450
The ultimate father/son prom ritual. I forgot.

17:20.484 --> 17:22.839
No, no, no, no. Don't worry about Stephen.

17:22.930 --> 17:25.390
Don't worry about anyone but yourself.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.210
And Amanda.

17:27.490 --> 17:28.490
And Amanda.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.620
Oh. Beautiful.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.960
I got it from the rose garden where we had our first kiss.

17:36.290 --> 17:37.620
You thought of everything.

17:38.620 --> 17:39.720
I tried.

17:41.130 --> 17:44.770
Don't forget to stop and smell the roses every so often yourself tonight.

17:44.805 --> 17:47.370
Actually double-dyeing the corsage eliminated the scent of--

17:48.620 --> 17:50.860
You mean to focus less on making things perfect

17:50.895 --> 17:52.350
And more on having a good time.

17:52.430 --> 17:53.350
Yes.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.100
Look at you.

17:59.110 --> 18:00.360
When you first came here,

18:01.120 --> 18:03.070
everything in the world was new.

18:03.530 --> 18:05.080
Look at all you've learned.

18:05.890 --> 18:07.560
Look at all you've overcome.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.400
Tonight's a celebration of that.

18:10.410 --> 18:12.080
Just breathe and enjoy it.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.220
I'm sorry you had to say good-bye to Adam.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.250
He's doing what he thinks is best for me.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.360
Still, I know it's hard to say good-bye to family.

18:29.330 --> 18:30.710
Adam created me.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.780
He's my mentor and my friend.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.050
But you are my family.

18:55.140 --> 18:56.770
Your decorations are ugly.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.370
They'll look better once we turn the lights down.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.550
All right. Fine. It sucks.

19:07.585 --> 19:09.200
It's like Charlie Brown's christmas tree.

19:09.750 --> 19:10.800
I don't know what that means.

19:10.835 --> 19:12.540
Ugly. It means ugly.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.710
And everyone else left, so I don't have time to go home.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.550
I have to get ready here.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.860
I just wanted to make it special for Kyle, but I blew it.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.240
Anyways, thanks for the dress.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.160
Did you deliver the dress?

19:38.300 --> 19:40.020
Your prom is going to be terrible.

19:41.830 --> 19:42.650
Why?

19:43.380 --> 19:45.330
Well, the decorations are a disaster,

19:45.340 --> 19:47.470
and Amanda has to get ready in the school locker room.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.030
Why didn't she ask me for help?

19:49.410 --> 19:51.150
She wanted to make it special for you.

19:51.740 --> 19:52.790
She did?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.920
Maybe if you two stopped working so hard

19:54.955 --> 19:56.860
to make it special, you'd enjoy it more.

19:57.210 --> 19:59.540
Or maybe there's still something I can do to fix it.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.770
I figured you'd say something like that.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.350
Which is why you called. Thank you.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.880
This doesn't mean I like her, by the way.

20:07.750 --> 20:08.660
I know.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.450
Thanks to Jessi, I had an idea

20:22.485 --> 20:24.470
of how to make Amanda's night a little better.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.010
Her expectations may have disappeared,

20:27.430 --> 20:29.660
but my desire to surpass them hadn't.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.810
Could this day get any worse?

20:38.390 --> 20:39.360
Not funny.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.140
I thought, uh, you could use some help getting ready.

20:44.770 --> 20:45.690
What?

20:45.740 --> 20:48.120
Did you poison my makeup or put fleas in my dress?

20:48.250 --> 20:50.130
I think you like being mean to me.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.600
Well, that's just a little bit of

20:51.635 --> 20:53.470
the pot calling the kettle black, now, isn't it?

20:53.505 --> 20:54.800
The pot and the kettle are black.

20:54.835 --> 20:55.840
My point exactly.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.800
Well, after tonight, it doesn't matter anyway.

20:59.930 --> 21:00.960
What's that supposed to mean?

21:00.970 --> 21:02.330
It means I'm leaving town.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.180
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.480
Why? You hate me.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.810
But I know how important you are to Kyle.

21:13.510 --> 21:14.690
And when you care about somebody,

21:14.725 --> 21:16.390
you wanna put their feelings first.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.580
So how's it going?

21:22.480 --> 21:23.450
All set.

21:27.710 --> 21:30.300
You have to scuff the bottom of your shoes before you walk in them.

21:30.335 --> 21:32.510
- Helps give you traction.
- Yeah. I didn't know that.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.410
Actually, I didn't either. Kyle told me.

21:34.450 --> 21:36.100
The prom know-it-all strikes again.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.210
- So, listen--
- Please don't.

21:40.245 --> 21:41.280
I have to.

21:41.770 --> 21:43.620
Then could you make it quick and painless, please?

21:43.655 --> 21:45.850
All right. You want it quick and painless? Don't use this.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.810
You don't want me to have safe sex?

21:47.845 --> 21:48.680
No.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.560
I-- I mean yes,

21:51.170 --> 21:53.220
I do want you to have safe sex,

21:53.255 --> 21:55.350
but, no, I don't want you to have sex at all.

21:55.385 --> 21:57.450
I'd much rather you wait till you know you're ready,

21:57.470 --> 21:59.490
till you and Andy know you're ready.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.410
It'll mean a whole lot more if you do.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.050
But if you decide to ignore everything I say

22:06.060 --> 22:08.800
and make you own monumentally life-altering

22:08.835 --> 22:10.540
no-going-back decision to have sex,

22:10.575 --> 22:13.640
forever changing the relationship you have with Andy,

22:14.170 --> 22:16.230
then I want you to be protected.

22:18.140 --> 22:19.140
Can I go now?

22:19.860 --> 22:20.790
Yes.

22:22.150 --> 22:23.220
Whoa. Hold up.

22:25.670 --> 22:27.410
A little screwy loop here.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.390
Okay.

22:32.950 --> 22:33.790
Good to go.

22:35.340 --> 22:37.420
- Thanks, dad.
- You're welcome.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.040
Hey, handsome.

22:43.850 --> 22:45.520
So how was the talk, part two?

22:46.190 --> 22:49.200
Well, a little like that condom I just gave our son.

22:49.220 --> 22:51.050
Clumsy, awkward, but hopefully effective.

22:52.890 --> 22:55.340
Are you sure you're okay with missing your dinner to help with my plan?

22:55.520 --> 22:57.240
Do you think for one minute that Lori Trager

22:57.275 --> 22:59.410
Would let us miss an opportunity to help you and Amanda?

23:00.040 --> 23:02.510
We're skipping the pre-prom dinner? Sweet!

23:02.810 --> 23:04.590
You were paying for that part, weren't you?

23:04.625 --> 23:05.560
I was indeed.

23:05.590 --> 23:06.850
What's taking them so long?

23:06.885 --> 23:08.660
I've been gorgeous for hours already.

23:09.690 --> 23:12.200
Let's go, people! We have a prom to save!

23:12.910 --> 23:14.970
You are ruining our entrance.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.740
- Lori, you look--
- Yeah, yeah.

23:20.840 --> 23:21.820
Josh?

23:22.260 --> 23:23.860
What you are about to experience

23:23.990 --> 23:27.300
is a defining moment in your otherwise idiotic life.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.150
Do not mess it up.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.520
Looking good, Trager.

23:33.690 --> 23:35.580
Not bad yourself, McDonough.

23:35.660 --> 23:36.630
Where's...

23:39.810 --> 23:40.730
Andy.

23:51.410 --> 23:52.820
All my research had been right.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.570
No matter what anyone said about expectations,

23:55.930 --> 23:59.060
everyone secretly hoped this would be the best night of their lives.

24:00.780 --> 24:02.430
Oh, my god!

24:02.440 --> 24:04.120
I knew that more than just helping Amanda,

24:04.290 --> 24:07.730
my night had just become about making sure everyone got their wish.

24:19.780 --> 24:20.970
You did that on purpose.

24:21.650 --> 24:22.480
Maybe.

24:26.570 --> 24:28.230
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:29.410 --> 24:30.490
Jessi helped me.

24:31.050 --> 24:32.150
You did?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.540
Well, I didn't want to, but she was really pathetic.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.380
Thanks.

24:37.410 --> 24:38.300
You're welcome.

24:38.335 --> 24:39.920
Okay. Good to know a little girl-bonding

24:39.960 --> 24:41.290
didn't upset the balance of nature.

24:42.750 --> 24:45.370
- What time is it?
- Relax. We're here early.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.010
Kyle's waiting for you in the gym.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.920
You've gone soft.

24:58.870 --> 25:00.600
I had a near-death experience.

25:01.210 --> 25:03.790
It's gonna take me a few days to return to normal.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.710
Hi.

26:01.550 --> 26:02.370
Hi.

26:07.250 --> 26:08.350
It's perfect.

26:09.470 --> 26:10.730
I had a little help.

26:30.410 --> 26:32.210
Heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.

26:32.230 --> 26:34.110
Heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.800
I think the problem is I have two left feet.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.970
I never noticed. How do you buy shoes?

26:38.170 --> 26:39.290
It's an expression.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.130
But you knew that, didn't you?

26:48.170 --> 26:49.950
Those jewels aren't real, you know!

26:50.100 --> 26:51.460
Whatever, Hillary!

26:57.020 --> 26:59.610
Don't drink that. Someone spiked the punch.

26:59.710 --> 27:00.800
That's impossible.

27:01.660 --> 27:04.640
According to my research, it happens at 68% of all proms.

27:05.680 --> 27:06.950
I have to take care of this.

27:07.290 --> 27:10.100
And something's leaking by the DJ table. There's water everywhere.

27:10.110 --> 27:11.010
I'm on it.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.620
Where's Declan?

27:26.400 --> 27:27.960
Hopefully not looking for me.

27:30.210 --> 27:31.160
Where's Andy?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.870
I, uh, ditched her on the dance floor.

27:34.450 --> 27:35.730
A man needs a break, you know?

27:38.760 --> 27:40.330
Why are you both hiding from your dates?

27:41.720 --> 27:42.720
You want this one?

27:43.510 --> 27:45.140
He's hiding because he's freaking out

27:45.175 --> 27:47.050
about whether or not to have sex with Andy.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.910
She wants this. I mean, I can't blame her.

27:52.310 --> 27:54.070
But she's so much more experienced than I am.

27:55.570 --> 27:57.030
So, yeah, I'm totally freaking out.

27:58.210 --> 27:58.970
Right.

28:00.530 --> 28:01.420
Your turn.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.390
She's messed up because she doesn't know

28:04.425 --> 28:06.290
whether or not to get back together with Declan.

28:07.190 --> 28:07.970
Yep.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.560
Prom is stressful.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.580
True that.

28:14.870 --> 28:16.070
It doesn't have to be.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.310
Are you kidding? You've been flipping out all week.

28:20.510 --> 28:23.520
I know. But Nicole taught me something.

28:24.590 --> 28:26.700
You're busting out a mom moment right now?

28:26.850 --> 28:29.800
She said that tonight is a celebration of how far we've come,

28:29.835 --> 28:32.350
and we should just let it happen and enjoy it.

28:34.700 --> 28:35.960
I have come a long way.

28:37.070 --> 28:38.790
From dumb to dumber.

28:39.540 --> 28:41.240
Better than a slut to sluttier.

28:41.950 --> 28:43.430
- That's the old me.
- Oh.

28:44.580 --> 28:47.490
Which means I have come a long way.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.320
That Nicole Trager, she's pretty good.

28:51.870 --> 28:52.980
Yes, she is.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.500
You're not so bad yourself.

29:03.190 --> 29:04.100
Shall we?

29:06.550 --> 29:07.700
Okay.

29:12.990 --> 29:15.500
All right. Tell me the truth.

29:15.840 --> 29:16.640
About what?

29:16.660 --> 29:18.350
We lost the song contest, didn't we?

29:20.320 --> 29:21.730
We lost the song contest.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.160
Well, that's just...

29:25.360 --> 29:26.760
...fine, actually.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.370
- Is it?
- Yeah.

29:29.010 --> 29:30.570
I didn't write that song for this.

29:30.605 --> 29:34.290
I wrote it because I had something to say about myself and...

29:34.810 --> 29:36.010
Everyone here tonight.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.740
Well, no one's heard it except me.

29:39.490 --> 29:42.180
The perils of the undiscovered songwriting duo.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.020
Destined for a lonely life on the road.

29:45.055 --> 29:47.660
With only their college degrees to keep them warm at night.

29:47.695 --> 29:48.950
Ph.Ds, please.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.090
You have a Ph.D.?

29:50.100 --> 29:52.690
No, not yet. How old do you think I am?

29:53.160 --> 29:54.180
How old are you?

29:54.570 --> 29:55.980
I'm 19.

29:56.710 --> 29:58.040
You're only 19?

29:58.910 --> 30:01.950
I was--I was sort of an early bloomer, academically speaking.

30:01.970 --> 30:04.420
And you've been torturing me about being so young.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.720
You are unbelievable.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.710
But I'm half of a pretty great songwriting duo.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.300
I don't know about great. You heard the song.

30:13.180 --> 30:14.210
But have you?

30:20.390 --> 30:22.630
Hello, everyone. Hello.

30:22.665 --> 30:24.250
I hope you're all having a great night.

30:24.750 --> 30:28.510
This song is not the winner of the prom theme contest.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.380
But I though that everybody should get a chance to hear this song.

30:31.950 --> 30:36.020
It's written by someone who, in my opinion,

30:36.770 --> 30:38.830
knows a whole lot more about who she is

30:39.730 --> 30:43.800
and really what life's all about than she will ever admit.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.720
So, enjoy it.

30:58.830 --> 31:00.630
This isn't...

31:01.150 --> 31:02.990
How...

31:03.020 --> 31:05.040
I'm computer genius, remember

31:38.160 --> 31:39.340
What are you doing up here?

31:40.980 --> 31:41.980
Roof leak.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.950
What about you? I thought you went home hours ago.

31:46.070 --> 31:49.110
What do they call it? A last hurrah?

31:50.050 --> 31:51.110
A last hurrah?

31:54.610 --> 31:56.040
You're leaving with Sarah tonight.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.260
Yeah.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.240
You're not gonna ask her to stay?

32:01.540 --> 32:03.200
Amanda said something to me earlier.

32:04.410 --> 32:07.160
If you care about someone, you wanna put their feelings first.

32:08.380 --> 32:09.840
I wanna do that for Sarah.

32:11.870 --> 32:12.840
I understand.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.420
I guess I just wish she'd done the same for you.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.220
Thank you for your help tonight.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.580
It's amazing what we can accomplish when we work together, isn't it?

32:40.310 --> 32:42.160
I'm gonna miss you, Jessi.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.780
No, you're not.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.820
Because no matter where I am,

32:49.760 --> 32:51.160
we're always connected.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.050
That's true.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.520
Even if I am smarter.

32:57.340 --> 32:59.100
- Stronger.
- Faster.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.330
You, uh...

33:22.520 --> 33:25.790
You better get back in there and make some more memories.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.530
They're kinda hard to come by for people like you and me.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.770
You should come down, too.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.470
A last hurrah.

33:39.290 --> 33:40.660
A last hurrah.

34:13.110 --> 34:14.270
You've been following me.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.159
Nice tux.

34:21.070 --> 34:22.460
Why all the secrecy?

34:24.210 --> 34:25.600
I didn't want to distract you.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.449
You're worried about Latnok, aren't you?

34:31.820 --> 34:33.230
You don't trust them either.

34:33.580 --> 34:34.940
Well, they're scientists.

34:35.969 --> 34:37.710
I don't know if they should be trusted.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.790
Do I have anything to worry about?

34:42.739 --> 34:44.100
You should always worry.

34:46.710 --> 34:47.880
Not tonight.

34:49.010 --> 34:50.610
Tonight is about Amanda.

34:51.550 --> 34:52.719
We'll be fine.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.540
Okay.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.170
I'll go.

35:00.100 --> 35:00.910
But, Foss.

35:03.540 --> 35:04.870
Thanks for looking out for me.

35:27.060 --> 35:29.620
God, I love a man in a tux.

35:29.710 --> 35:30.680
Me, too.

35:31.050 --> 35:33.110
I mean, I like being the man you love in a tux.

35:33.145 --> 35:35.000
Okay, so we've had our pictures taken.

35:35.330 --> 35:39.200
We've danced. We've eaten weird french hors d'oeuvrey things.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.870
We've covered every prom cliché? In the book,

35:42.905 --> 35:47.370
and now I think we should move onto our end of the night festivities.

35:48.060 --> 35:49.010
Okay.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.390
Let me begin by saying you're the hottest girl I know,

35:52.420 --> 35:55.990
and I fantasize about having sex with you, like, all the time.

35:56.025 --> 35:58.360
And I really wanted to have sex with you tonight.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.950
But then my dad comes up to me

36:00.985 --> 36:03.600
and didn't make any sense about whatever he was trying to say

36:03.635 --> 36:05.260
and wanted to give me a condom,

36:05.390 --> 36:06.800
and it all became real.

36:07.380 --> 36:10.650
And anyway, I just... don't think we should.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.730
You think I wanted to give it up to you tonight?

36:15.900 --> 36:16.860
Didn't you?

36:19.070 --> 36:21.320
Losing my virginity on prom night

36:21.355 --> 36:24.410
is the most cliché? Of all things cliché?

36:26.040 --> 36:28.420
What kind of sentimental loser do you think I am?

36:29.770 --> 36:31.780
Wait. You're a virgin?

36:33.050 --> 36:34.390
Why wouldn't I be?

36:35.550 --> 36:38.110
So what did you mean then, if not sex?

36:41.840 --> 36:43.920
Triple chocolate sundaes

36:43.955 --> 36:48.160
and me kicking your ass yet again in G-Force Extreme.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.660
Really?

36:53.700 --> 36:54.630
Really.

37:02.890 --> 37:03.780
There you are.

37:04.510 --> 37:06.170
I'm finally done putting out fires.

37:07.770 --> 37:09.630
I'm assuming there were no actual fires.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.140
No, no fires.

37:11.880 --> 37:12.970
A flood or two.

37:13.770 --> 37:15.480
I guess there was more than one leak.

37:16.700 --> 37:17.870
The cleaning crew will get it.

37:18.390 --> 37:19.920
I think it's time for a dance.

37:21.190 --> 37:22.650
I think that sounds great.

37:23.420 --> 37:24.900
Have a great night, everyone.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.300
The prom as we know it has ended.

37:29.860 --> 37:30.830
It's over.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.200
It doesn't have to be.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.780
May I have this dance?

37:48.280 --> 37:49.070
- Bye!
- Later!

37:49.320 --> 37:50.700
Gotta go, pumpkins.

37:50.730 --> 37:52.140
I got a tiara to stalk.

37:52.660 --> 37:54.940
- Good night.
- Later, Hils.

37:55.970 --> 37:59.240
So what's next on our Hillary-approved itinerary?

38:00.380 --> 38:01.330
How'd you know?

38:01.510 --> 38:03.970
Cause she had that glint of a job well done in her eyes.

38:04.930 --> 38:06.770
I didn't want to mess anything up.

38:08.150 --> 38:10.010
How could you think you could mess it up?

38:10.300 --> 38:12.070
Cause I feel like that's all I've ever done

38:12.105 --> 38:13.640
Since the first time we got together.

38:14.510 --> 38:16.500
I couldn't even break up with you properly.

38:17.310 --> 38:18.680
We're so passed that.

38:18.870 --> 38:22.550
Look, I know I said I'd be more open and all that,

38:22.560 --> 38:24.580
so let me do this.

38:25.150 --> 38:28.110
Right. Sorry. Continue with your openness.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.860
I really like you, Lori.

38:32.460 --> 38:33.630
I always have.

38:34.630 --> 38:36.230
I don't know where you stand with me

38:36.265 --> 38:38.170
or with what we're supposed to be or not be,

38:38.205 --> 38:42.200
but I want you to know that it's in your hands.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.350
It's in my hands? Why?

38:46.780 --> 38:48.300
Cause I heard your song tonight.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.250
Really heard it.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.640
The girl who wrote it has got her whole future in front of her.

38:55.740 --> 38:57.810
I don't wanna be the one that holds her back.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.480
You know what's amazing?

39:05.480 --> 39:08.770
Is you really know me, and you get me.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.290
I care about you so much.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.690
But you're right.

39:18.330 --> 39:19.760
I don't wanna move backwards.

39:20.690 --> 39:22.940
Or even stay in the same place.

39:27.410 --> 39:28.270
So...

39:29.140 --> 39:31.350
I think that means that we shouldn't be together.

39:32.550 --> 39:33.770
Is that okay?

39:35.280 --> 39:38.020
I seem to remember it's part of the whole "it's in your hands" thing.

39:40.110 --> 39:41.250
Do you mean it?

39:42.260 --> 39:43.920
Trager, you're one of my best friends.

39:44.830 --> 39:46.790
All I want is for you to be happy.

39:48.590 --> 39:50.310
I don't know if I deserve that.

39:50.540 --> 39:53.730
Trust me, you do.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.230
You did that, didn't you?

40:25.860 --> 40:26.770
Maybe.

40:29.050 --> 40:30.320
So how do you do it all?

40:31.020 --> 40:31.850
Do what?

40:32.610 --> 40:34.080
Everything I've seen you do.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.010
My brain is more developed than other people's.

40:38.430 --> 40:40.510
It allows me to do special things.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.700
Kinda like superman, only real?

40:45.260 --> 40:46.330
Can you fly?

40:46.650 --> 40:47.850
I'm not gonna tell you that

40:47.885 --> 40:49.960
until you tell me something I don't know about you.

40:50.190 --> 40:52.140
- Not this again.
- It's only fair.

40:54.110 --> 40:55.650
You may not know that...

40:59.450 --> 41:00.660
I love you.

41:05.220 --> 41:06.260
You do?

41:07.660 --> 41:08.600
I do.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.430
I love you, too.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.610
Here, don't get your feet wet.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.490
There's a reason why people say

41:29.525 --> 41:31.110
we shouldn't expect too much.

41:31.770 --> 41:34.900
No one wants to see someone they care about end up disappointed.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.450
We instinctively act

41:52.485 --> 41:54.300
to protect our own from being hurt

41:54.720 --> 41:57.670
and do what we can to make the right choices for the people we love.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.810
But the reason we have expectations in the first place

42:03.400 --> 42:05.630
is because we wanna aim as high as we can.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.930
Because when you love someone,

42:10.110 --> 42:12.500
there's no limit to what you can accomplish.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.360
Oh! I left my other clothes inside.

42:24.730 --> 42:26.090
- I'll get them.
- No, I will.

42:26.110 --> 42:27.170
No, let me help you.

42:27.205 --> 42:28.610
- Again.
- Always.

42:41.880 --> 42:42.950
Got everything you need?

42:44.780 --> 42:45.540
I do now.

42:46.305 --> 42:52.912
