You just have to sign
this release,

00:09.443 --> 00:11.410
And we'll take your brother
to the funeral home

00:11.412 --> 00:14.113
To prepare him
for cremation.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.781
Could you just give us
a minute, please?

00:19.386 --> 00:21.387
(door opens)

00:21.389 --> 00:23.222
(door closes)

00:25.125 --> 00:26.792
He looks the same.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.029
Like he's still in there.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.168
Is he?

00:40.807 --> 00:43.075
I don't know.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.379
What do you mean?
Can't you see him?

00:47.381 --> 00:50.282
Alex, let's not do this
right now.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.684
No. No, seriously.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.453
You said you're a medium.
That--

00:54.455 --> 00:57.790
Th-that's what you said,
right? You can talk to ghosts?

00:57.792 --> 01:00.559
So... Talk.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.595
Why don't I give you
some space,

01:03.597 --> 01:05.397
And we can talk about it
later?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.332
Mm.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.703
(picks up clipboard)

01:11.705 --> 01:14.406
(paper rustles)

01:14.408 --> 01:16.308
I can't sign this right now.

01:21.681 --> 01:24.149
(gasps softly and exhales)

01:28.388 --> 01:30.089
I have to go to work.

01:34.494 --> 01:39.565
â™ª

01:42.268 --> 01:44.103
So no funeral?

01:44.105 --> 01:46.271
We'll do a memorial next week
in st. Catharine's.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.706
I'll scatter his ashes here.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.475
Fun.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.710
Yeah, not so much.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.846
Wake up, honey, wake up.

01:53.848 --> 01:56.448
Is that her?
That's her, right?

01:56.450 --> 01:58.283
Definitely.
Excuse me, dr. Reid?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.451
Yes?

01:59.453 --> 02:02.154
(exhales) my name's
marvin kapogrecko.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.555
This is my son.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.557
I have a sarcoma.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.825
Nice to meet you.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.161
His name is lou.
Luke?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.729
Lou. Are you the expert?

02:10.731 --> 02:13.332
Um... Not an expert, no.

A review" by dr. Alex reid.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.176
It was my third year paper.

02:24.178 --> 02:27.179
Wow. Mine was boils.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.881
You found my paper online?
I found it.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.716
The internet makes my dad
say bad words.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.251
(laughs)
(laughs)

02:32.253 --> 02:34.553
Well, that's--
that's true, buddy.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.221
We are so glad we found you.

02:36.223 --> 02:39.358
What can I do for you?
Everything, doctor.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.828
Everything in the world.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.464

02:45.466 --> 02:47.866
I'm not really an expert,

But you can still help us,
right?

02:51.738 --> 02:53.472

02:58.278 --> 02:59.811
So...

02:59.813 --> 03:01.413

(clears throat)

03:07.421 --> 03:08.720
Celebrating?

03:08.722 --> 03:09.788
You could say that, yeah.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.324
Actually, some news--

03:12.326 --> 03:14.426
The board just extended
my term as chief here.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.794
Five years.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.931
Wow, th--hey, congratulations.
Mm-hmm.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.465
Yes, I should be, uh,
signing the paperwork

03:20.467 --> 03:22.601
Later this afternoon.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.902
Don't get so excited,
joel, okay?

03:23.904 --> 03:26.205
'cause you're
embarrassing me now.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.906
What--what, uh...
They didn't meet your terms?

03:27.908 --> 03:30.642
No, the terms were met.
So? What?

03:30.644 --> 03:33.579
I don't know.
It's the job, I guess.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.314
You know, y-you sort of
never feel good,

03:35.316 --> 03:37.216
You never feel bad,
you just kind of feel like

03:37.218 --> 03:39.318
You're getting...
The job done.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.687
Trapped at the top.
Poor joel.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.222
You know what
I'm talking about.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.923
26 specialists
in this hospital,

03:44.925 --> 03:46.925
Every single one of them
wants something from you.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.493
What do you want?
That's the point.

03:48.495 --> 03:49.895
Don't matter what I want,
dana.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.630
Of course it matters.
(cell phone vibrating)

03:51.632 --> 03:53.899
Guess who this is,
by the way.
The nurse?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.934
I'm gonna say someone
who wants something.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.304
(phone clicks)
and look at that.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.806
I'm correct.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.641
Good-bye.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.677
Her name's marla.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.878
You named your tumor?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.413
It's after his favorite nurse.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.549
At the grace in winnipeg.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.885
She gave an <i>awesome</i>
<i>shark figure.</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

04:13.887 --> 04:17.389
Like, <i>awesome</i> shark figure.
(laughs)

04:17.391 --> 04:19.758
Okay, lou, I'm gonna check
your patellar reflexes.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.660
You ready?
Mm-hmm.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.028
Let's let this dangle. I'm gonna
hold the back of your knee.

04:23.030 --> 04:23.996
Relax.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.699
Very good. Now...

04:27.701 --> 04:29.534
Push against my hand
with your shin.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.836
Oh...

04:30.838 --> 04:32.671
Wow, you're very strong.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.806
Yeah, I play sports.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.808
That's what it is.
You have a good kick.
Yeah.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.044
This imaging--
is it recent?

04:39.046 --> 04:41.413
Two weeks.
Let's take a look.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.315
Uh... I know it looks bad,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.284
But the growth
has actually slowed,

04:45.286 --> 04:47.586
And if you look at it,
his, uh...

04:47.588 --> 04:49.888
His white cell count
is normal.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.324
His liver seems to be clear.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.725
You've done your research.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.661
Well, we had to.
We, uh...

04:55.663 --> 04:57.696
Well, tumors are
kind of our thing.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.930
Yeah, we know a lot

04:58.932 --> 05:00.632
About tumors.
The doctors back home--

05:00.634 --> 05:02.401
They don't know what the hell
they're talking about.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.902
Why do you say that?
When we first went in--

05:03.904 --> 05:06.605
And this was a year ago--
he had pain in his abdomen.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.640
It hurt when I breathed.
You know what the doc
gave him?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.808
What?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.543
Laxatives.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.978
He said lou was constipated.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.880
They sent him home
to eat prunes.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.948
I'm sorry.
This is your oncologist?

05:16.950 --> 05:19.718
No, it's a g.P.
In our small town.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.086
We live on a farm.

05:21.088 --> 05:24.456
I saw the doctor
on the second day of school.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.559
They didn't find marla till
my friend andrew's birthday.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.761
Eight months. And he shipped us
off to winnipeg,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.596
Then they tell us it's too late,

05:31.598 --> 05:33.498
There's nothing
that can be done.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.534
And we're supposed
to accept that?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.703
So you've come here
for a second opinion?

05:37.705 --> 05:40.038
Second, third, sixth.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.907
And then we found your paper.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.946
You can cut it out,
dr. Reid.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.748
Can't you?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.454
I'll talk to
the chief of surgery.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.457
Stay put. I'll be back.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.425
I'm not changing my mind.

06:00.427 --> 06:01.793
We're their last shot, joel.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.028
This is a hospital, alex.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.596
It's not a refuge
for lost souls.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.365
I think I can help him.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.833
Alex, I understand you just
lost your brother.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.568
That's not what this
is about.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.470
Alex, this tumor has its
hooks in bone and tissue,

06:11.472 --> 06:13.572
In organs and veins.
It's--

06:13.574 --> 06:15.507
Do you want my advice?
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.809
Don't do it. I agree with
the surgeon in winnipeg.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.711
I mean, we should let this boy
live out his last days

06:19.713 --> 06:21.146
With a degree of dignity.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.148
No, we can't give up on him.
Okay, I'll tell you what.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.584
You can convince one doctor
in this entire hospital

06:25.586 --> 06:27.486
That this tumor's operable,
you go nuts.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.521
Joel--
otherwise, you should
just accept

06:29.523 --> 06:30.889
What their oncologist
has said,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.691
And what I am telling you
right now.
Which is?

06:32.693 --> 06:34.126
Which is absolutely not.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.527
(sighs)

06:35.529 --> 06:37.396
Catch a tiger by...

06:37.398 --> 06:38.630
Mr. Kapogrecko.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.065
What did he say?

06:41.868 --> 06:43.168
We're a go.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.405
(exhales deeply) huh?

06:46.407 --> 06:49.941
(chuckles) okay, buddy.

06:53.713 --> 06:56.782

06:59.152 --> 07:02.454

<i>to see you, either.</i>

07:02.456 --> 07:04.523

are you still doing here?

07:04.525 --> 07:07.025
<i>If I knew, would I be</i>
<i>bothering you?</i>

07:07.027 --> 07:08.660
Good point.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.128

<i>this is the part</i>

07:10.130 --> 07:11.496
<i>Where you tell me</i>
<i>how this works,</i>

07:11.498 --> 07:12.831
<i>How I get out of here.</i>

07:12.833 --> 07:13.899
(grunts)

07:17.003 --> 07:18.770
Listen, usually when I see
a ghost,

07:18.772 --> 07:21.006
I help them resolve something,
and then they disappear.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.508
<i>So I have some</i>
<i>unresolved issue?</i>
<i>I guess so. I don't know.</i>

07:23.510 --> 07:25.143
<i>All right. You gonna</i>
<i>help me resolve it?</i>

07:25.145 --> 07:26.978
I... Not right now.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.880
<i>(luke) charlie, please--</i>

07:28.882 --> 07:31.516
Luke. I can't be talking
to you right now.

You need, what,
five surgeons total?

08:03.584 --> 08:05.217
Reycraft--
look,

08:05.219 --> 08:06.885
You know what
charles de gaulle said.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.687
No, I don't,
and neither do you.

step by step

08:10.190 --> 08:11.923

08:11.925 --> 08:13.191
Mm-hmm.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.694
And you can quote me
on that.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.964
Thank you.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.701
Press against my hand,
please, ida.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.837
Yeah, you seem to have lost
a little power

08:25.839 --> 08:27.572
Since you fractured your leg.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.140
Let's lift this up.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.575
I'll check your extension
there--

08:30.577 --> 08:33.011
Ohh!
What is it?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.247
I just won 5 bucks.
Scratch ticket.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.582
You do know that risk-seeking
behavior can be a side effect

08:37.584 --> 08:39.651
Of the dopamine you take
to control your tremors, right?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.620
It's just a scratch ticket.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.755
I'm not running away
with a gigolo.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.023

08:45.025 --> 08:47.058
Ida? Dr. Hamza's ready
to start the study.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.760
What study is this?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.128
We're going biking.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.131
(pounding on door)
dr. Murphy!

08:53.133 --> 08:55.567
I need your help!
Right now!

08:55.569 --> 08:58.069
(pounding continues)
I need your help.
Right now.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.072

09:01.074 --> 09:02.807
Our appointment's
not till 4:00.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.076
I brought her in like you
asked me to, dr. Murphy,

09:05.078 --> 09:07.112
So you could help me say
good-bye to vallenwe'en.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.114
Yes, and we discussed
that we'd meet later.
Dr. Murphy, she's gone.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.850
She's gone, and I lost her.
Oh--walter.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.919
Vallenwe'en! Vallenwe'en!
Walter.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.555
Vallenwe'en!
Walter!

09:16.557 --> 09:18.189

I thought we were making
good progress.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.592
My heart--
my chest is, uh...

09:20.594 --> 09:23.295
Walter, you need to calm down.
You're feeling anxious because--
okay.

09:23.297 --> 09:24.763
I can't think. I...

09:24.765 --> 09:26.665
Walter--
I... (panting)

09:26.667 --> 09:28.767
Where did you last see her?
She was with me
in the lobby.

09:28.769 --> 09:33.772
And she--I retraced my--
(gasps loudly)

09:33.774 --> 09:35.674
Somebody kidnapped her.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.076
(chuckles) or somebody
found her, and she's safe.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.078
She can't take this
sweater off.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.880
She doesn't have thumbs
like us.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.049
Someone took it off her.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.283
Walter...
Mm...

09:45.285 --> 09:47.352
I need you to calm down,
okay?
Oh, boy.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.988
Oh, boy, dr. Murphy, I'm not
feeling very well at all.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.356
Walter. Walter--walter!
Oh...

09:51.358 --> 09:53.058
Okay. Walter--
(panting and muttering)

09:53.060 --> 09:55.660
Take some breaths, okay?
Can I get a stretcher, please?

09:55.662 --> 09:57.362
Dr. Murphy,
you need a hand here?

09:57.364 --> 10:00.632
Yeah. This is... Walter.
He's complaining of chest pains.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.233
Okay, take a nice,
deep breath, walter.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.902
(exhales)

10:03.904 --> 10:05.837
What happened?
He lost his guinea pig.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.974
(breathing heavily)

10:08.976 --> 10:10.308
Mm-hmm.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.110
(walter sighs)

10:13.613 --> 10:15.313
Bicycle therapy.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.015
I know.
It's exciting, right?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.150
Improving gait
and postural therapy

10:19.152 --> 10:20.785
In parkinson's patients

10:20.787 --> 10:22.887
Using bicycles.
So how much?

10:22.889 --> 10:24.823
I'm sorry?
How much am I spending?

10:24.825 --> 10:26.391
Uh, $223,000.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.693
You've got to be kidding me.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.696
I don't kid.
But watch this.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.832
Ida...

10:33.834 --> 10:35.800
Okay.
Can you get up?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.235
Okay...

10:37.237 --> 10:38.803
Ida, step.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.008
Shahir, she doesn't have
this kind of mobility.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.977
Step, ida.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.045
Step.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.215
Do you see how well
she's walking? Hmm?

10:50.217 --> 10:51.783
Step.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.819
We call it kinesia paradoxica.
Nurse.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.856
Guided movements can help these
patients become more mobile.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.658
So does it last?

10:59.660 --> 11:02.160
Well, the tremors
and rigidity, um,

11:02.162 --> 11:04.763
Start up almost immediately
once the exercise is stopped.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.399
Okay. That's great.
Easy.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.401
(lowered voice)
so... What is the point?

11:09.403 --> 11:11.136
(lowered voice)
we don't know the point,

11:11.138 --> 11:13.338
Which is what is so exciting.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.774
$200,000?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.342
No, $223,000.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.410
Bicycles?

11:18.412 --> 11:20.078
Mm-hmm.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.946
Bicycles.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.084
(indistinct conversations)

11:32.992 --> 11:34.826
Charlie?

11:35.795 --> 11:36.928
Hey.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.102
Wow.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.905
That's the most advanced
liposarcoma I've ever seen.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.940
Do you think it's operable?

11:48.942 --> 11:51.242
I mean, that would be
a long shot, but, uh,

11:51.244 --> 11:53.078
It's better than...

11:53.080 --> 11:54.813
(breathes deeply)
well, you're gonna need

11:54.815 --> 11:56.948
A lot of skill, a lot of hands,
and a lot of luck.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.783
Will you help?

12:02.421 --> 12:04.255
Tumor's too big.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.057
I know.
When the digging is done,

12:06.059 --> 12:07.192
You'll have a big hole
to fill.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.293
No way.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.360
Would you do
a pedicle flap?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.296
Nope. Rotation.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.298
And stop trying to close
your girlfriend's deals.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.933
Ah, come on, dana, all you
got to do is come in

12:14.935 --> 12:17.235
For a patch job.
It's a st. Jude special.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.403
The patron saint of...

12:18.405 --> 12:20.071
Lost causes.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.439
And kids.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.075
This kid, dana--
he's amazing.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.977
He would remind you--
don't say it.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.880
Molly.
(sighs)

12:28.882 --> 12:30.782
You know, that really is
below the belt,

12:30.784 --> 12:32.817
Playing the daughter card.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.452
(club thuds)

12:34.454 --> 12:36.121
Okay, I'll tell you what.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.957
You drain this,
and I'm in.

12:38.959 --> 12:39.991
I don't golf.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.126
Oh, that's too bad.

12:42.361 --> 12:43.962
Fine.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.410
New England vs. Miami.
Miami.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.514
Reycraft, can I talk to you?
Yeah, yeah, one second.

13:02.516 --> 13:05.016
Denver/oakland.
Denver.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.118
I want you to scrub in
on my liposarcoma.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.354
Which part of sinking into
a bottomless quagmire

13:09.356 --> 13:11.122
Didn't you understand?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.424
Atlanta vs. New orleans.
Charlie's in.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.226
Dude is your boyfriend.
Doesn't count.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.929
Atlanta vs. New orleans.
New orleans.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.431
What are you doing?
Girl has picked every
winner two weeks in a row.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.400
I didn't know you were
a football fan.

13:22.402 --> 13:26.037
I'm not. He names two cities,
I say where I'd rather vacation.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.473
Look...

13:28.475 --> 13:30.441
I need fast hands in there.
Name your price.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.210
It's like "indecent proposal."

13:32.212 --> 13:35.213
Cover all my calls
for the next three months.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.948
No. Six weeks.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.250
Two months.
You're on.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.052
And you take my niece jada
to see "the wizard of oz."

13:41.054 --> 13:42.554
We didn't shake on it.
Don't care.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.222
I hate musicals.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.523
Okay. Sure.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.926
Speaking of which,

13:47.928 --> 13:49.294
Where's my cut
from last week?

13:53.866 --> 13:55.066
How much did you win?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.868
Let's just say business
is good.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.503
I'm telling you,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.438
She has got a horseshoe
up her butt.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.473
I've never met anyone
that lucky.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.244
Huh.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.946
Maggie, wait.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.583
So we need to deliver this
bad boy "en bloc," in one piece.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.585
Reycraft and I will free it
from the intestines.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.920
Then I can extend the incision
and use the perispinal muscles

14:15.922 --> 14:17.856
As my posterior medial margin.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.224
We'll go in the front door
and start clearing house.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.925
Then I'll come in
and clean up after you.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.493
And what is my job?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.596
You are our good-luck charm
and our muscle.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.264
Muscle?
Yeah.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.565
Once we lift up the tumor
to start cutting,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.601
You can't put it down.
Okay?
Okay.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.603
Let's do this. Anything
the tumor touches has to go.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.504
His chest c.T. Showed
metastases,

14:33.506 --> 14:35.406
So if we get the primary...
(alex) we can cure him.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.576
But first I'd like you
to meet the patient.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.011
(sighs)

14:40.013 --> 14:41.579
How'd she get you
to say yes?

14:41.581 --> 14:43.514
Oh... Challenged her
to sink a putt.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.416
And she drained it?
Nah. Missed it by a mile.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.151
How about you?

14:47.153 --> 14:49.354
I hate musicals.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.322
Fair enough.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.259
(door opens)
lou, can I introduce you
to some folks?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.461
Yeah, sure.
This is dr. Harris.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.296
Hi.
Hi.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.931
Dr. Reycraft.
Hi.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.299
How you doing, champ?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.401
I'm maggie, and this is
dr. Kinney.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.003
Call me dana.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.104
This is your team
of surgeons.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.538
We're gonna hunt down
the tumor,

15:07.540 --> 15:08.573
And when you wake up...

15:08.575 --> 15:10.208
No more marla?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.676
No more marla.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.345
Okay, well,
text me when you're done.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.418
All right.
We'll see you soon.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.219
Okay.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.054
Okay.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.928
(elevator bell dings)

15:37.136 --> 15:38.636
<i>She won't let go.</i>

15:38.638 --> 15:40.672
She'll sign those papers
eventually--

15:40.674 --> 15:43.041
<i>That's not soon enough.</i>
<i>I can't be talking to her</i>
<i>about you right now.</i>

15:43.043 --> 15:44.709
You saw what happened--
<i>you don't understand</i>
<i>what this is like, charlie.</i>

15:44.711 --> 15:48.980
<i>I am in hell.</i>
<i>I see her.</i>

15:48.982 --> 15:51.249
<i>I see life all around me,</i>

15:51.251 --> 15:53.117
<i>And I cannot be</i>
<i>a part of it.</i>

15:55.154 --> 15:56.721
(elevator bell dings)

16:13.739 --> 16:16.541
(monitor beeping steadily)
oh, this tumor is heavy.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.443
Hang in there, maggie.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.311
The intestines are more
involved than I thought.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.014
We'll need to resect
a foot of the jejunum.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.749
By the way, my niece that
you're taking to the show--

16:24.751 --> 16:27.418
She isn't entirely
toilet trained.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.153
(alex) could you hold it up
a bit higher? Yeah.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.655
How's that?
Good.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.591
Reycraft, how do you feel
about this kidney?

16:33.593 --> 16:35.193
(monitor beeps)

16:35.195 --> 16:36.361
Not good.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.197
Being invaded by the tumor
on its lower pole.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.498
Then it's gotta go.
Clamps.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.566
(monitor beeps)

16:43.369 --> 16:45.336
(clicking)

16:45.338 --> 16:47.505
Clamp.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.573
(sighs)

16:48.575 --> 16:50.041
(snips)

16:57.282 --> 17:00.385
Okay. The kidney is free
posteriorly.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.153
Maggie, you're gonna have
to hold that up, too.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.454
Awesome.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.623
I'm feeling some
resistance here.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.425
Uh, could be
the presacral plexus.

17:07.427 --> 17:10.461
(sighs) I don't know.
I just... I can't--

17:10.463 --> 17:12.497
There.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.366
There is a monster vein
heading right into the tumor.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.802
I c--I can't visualize it
without risking tearing it out.

17:19.571 --> 17:21.506
(reycraft sighs) all right.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.141
(squishing)

17:23.143 --> 17:25.176
You're gonna have to cut it.
Blind?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.744
I don't even know
what it is.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.079
You have any other ideas?

17:28.081 --> 17:30.348
(sighs)

17:30.350 --> 17:31.582
Satinsky clamps.

17:32.751 --> 17:34.619
Okay.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.720
The vein...

17:35.722 --> 17:38.356
(clicking)

17:38.358 --> 17:40.124
Metz.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.530
(snips twice)

17:45.532 --> 17:46.831
Got it.

17:54.306 --> 17:55.673
Oh, hell, it's the cava.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.508
You cut off blood supply
to the legs.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.210
You need to call cardiac.
Get someone down here

17:59.212 --> 18:00.478
To do a dacron graft
to replace the cava.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
No, we don't have time.
His sats could drop.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.115
You cut the damn vein
that brings all the blood

18:04.117 --> 18:06.284
From his legs to his heart.
We have to deal with it.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.518
Can I just put the tumor down
while you guys--

18:07.520 --> 18:08.519
No!
No!

18:08.521 --> 18:10.088
Okay. He's young.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.689
He'll grow collateral veins.

18:11.691 --> 18:15.660
Little roads that take over
after the highway's gone.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.096
Are you confident with this?
Yes.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.864
Sats and pressure are holding.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.101
(sighs) this is gonna work.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.439
<i>(heartbeat whooshing)</i>
<i>thank god they found her.</i>
<i>Where was she?</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:30.475
In an elevator.
(sighs)

18:30.477 --> 18:33.444
Okay, walter, I'm just looking
at your heart right now.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.413
Are they feeding her?
They shouldn't give her oranges.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.881
They give her mouth sores.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.850
They will not feed her
unless you tell them to.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.885
But let's worry about
working on <i>you</i> first,

18:40.887 --> 18:43.287
And then we'll worry
about vallenwe'en.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.190
Your left ventricle
is barely moving.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.493
Put a stent in it,
problem solved.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.794
Her mother abandoned her,

18:49.796 --> 18:51.496
And that's why she wound up
in a pet store.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.731
So that's why I can't give her
to another pet store.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.333
And the creeps
that had her before,

18:55.335 --> 18:56.701
They never would change her hay.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.403
So when I adopted her,
all her hair was falling out,

18:59.405 --> 19:01.472
And she was, like,
scared of everybody,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.307
But now she has got, like,
this silky coat,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.409
And she is, like,
so friendly.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.178
Isn't she friendly,
dr. Murphy?

19:07.180 --> 19:09.847
You've definitely given
vallenwe'en a new lease on life.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.784
It's true.
Dr. Murphy is helping me see
how dependent I am on her.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.420
Walter's overly attached
to vallenwe'en,

19:16.422 --> 19:17.922
So we're working on
strengthening

19:17.924 --> 19:19.590
The attachments to the people
in his life

19:19.592 --> 19:21.626
And letting go of his pet.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.562
I just want to give her
a good home.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.597
I can't bear the thought of
her going to some strangers.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.533
I'll take her.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.902
What? You will?

19:30.904 --> 19:32.470
You will?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.172
Yeah. They want lettuce,
right?

19:34.174 --> 19:36.174
Arugula has the most calcium,
but yes.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.709
I will take her. I will
give her a good home.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.345
Dr. Bell, that is so nice.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.183
Dr. Murphy,
isn't that amazing?
Uh...

19:45.185 --> 19:47.718
I'll see you in a bit,
walter.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.687
(exhales)
(door closes)

19:51.757 --> 19:53.257
Everyone, in order for us
to get the most

19:53.259 --> 19:55.359
Out of this little spin class
we're doing,

19:55.361 --> 19:56.761
We're gonna have to really
push ourselves

19:56.763 --> 19:58.496
And light up the thalamus.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.264
Who's ready
to light that up?
(cheering)

20:00.266 --> 20:02.733
Great. Okay. Let's...

20:02.735 --> 20:04.802
<i>(disco music playing)</i>
<i>feel the pain, and...</i>

20:04.804 --> 20:06.804
(with patients)
oxygenate the brain.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.639
Great. Joel, you're more
than welcome to join

20:08.641 --> 20:10.274
The spin class here.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.876
I'll be doing
a little guided imagery.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.412
No, thank you. I'm just here
to watch hope zion's money

20:14.414 --> 20:15.947
Disappear into the toilet.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.348
Sorry?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.350
Ida!

20:19.352 --> 20:21.619
Sorry. It's the tremors.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.688
(wheels spinning)
okay. Careful now.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.523
I can do this.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.458
Ida, just... Careful.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.626
(clicks loudly)

20:28.628 --> 20:29.460
Ohh!
Ida! Ida!

20:29.462 --> 20:30.828
(clamoring)

20:30.830 --> 20:32.597
(joel) hey, hey, hey...

20:32.599 --> 20:33.531
Ida, are you okay?

20:33.533 --> 20:34.999
(stammers)

20:35.001 --> 20:38.736
<i>â™ª</i>

20:38.738 --> 20:41.706
Sats and pressure again.
Still holding.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.741
(exhales)
okay, so far, so good.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.476
Kidney is free anteriorly.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.278
He's tolerating
the resection.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.313
I don't feel any cancer
on the liver.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.682
Feeling the vertebral bodies.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.585
(sighs) there is definitely
more tumor there.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.387
Near the spine.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.623
Give it a feel.
Tell me what you think.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.459
Page dr. Harris, please.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.828
There's no plane.
Yeah. Damn.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.596
I think the tumor's invading
the l3 vertebra.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.931
The c.T. Didn't show it.

21:06.933 --> 21:07.932
Tumor has
the same consistency

21:07.934 --> 21:09.367
As the surrounding tissue
and fat,

21:09.369 --> 21:11.469
So it wouldn't
show on the c.T.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.970
Right.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.505
Did you reach dr. Harris?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.507
He's not picking up.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.909
Well, he should be answering.
He knows that we need him.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.846
I-I'm getting some v-tach.
His--his sats are dropping.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

21:21.848 --> 21:23.581
(man) dr. Reid?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.283
(beeping continues)

21:25.285 --> 21:26.717
Dr. Reid?

21:26.719 --> 21:27.518
Give him his lidocaine drip.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.986
Stabilize him.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.522
What--wh--
where are you going?
(gloves snap)

21:31.524 --> 21:33.991
Reycraft, make sure
we didn't miss any tumor.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.727
I'm going to get charlie.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.532
Come on, charlie.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.668
Pick up, pick up,
pick up.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.603
Dr. Reid?

21:45.605 --> 21:47.405
Mr. Kapogrecko.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.073
Wh--

21:49.075 --> 21:51.575
Shouldn't you...

21:51.577 --> 21:52.910
(gasps)

21:52.912 --> 21:56.380
No. No. It--it's okay.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.683
There were complications
during lou's surgery.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.018
He's not out of the woods yet,
but we managed to stabilize him.

22:01.020 --> 22:05.523
Oh! (exhales and sniffles)

22:05.525 --> 22:09.427
I thought you were gonna
tell me that he died.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.830
That's, uh, how it happened
with his mother.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.734
I mean, you never expect
a doctor

22:16.736 --> 22:19.637
To come out
and tell you that. (sniffles)

22:19.639 --> 22:21.772
Marvin,
he's hanging in there.

22:21.774 --> 22:25.443
You know, he's been
so tough about it all.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.812
He's smarter than me.

22:27.814 --> 22:31.082
And he never gives up.

22:31.084 --> 22:34.485
He's a good kid.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.954
No, he's a great kid.

22:39.491 --> 22:42.626
We are gonna get
through this.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.562
Okay?
(sighs)

22:44.564 --> 22:46.897
Just hang on
a little bit longer.

22:49.601 --> 22:51.035
(buttons click)

22:51.037 --> 22:52.103
(sighs, under breath)
come on, charlie.

22:52.105 --> 22:54.004
Answer the damn phone.

22:56.441 --> 22:57.875
You lied to my patient.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.111
What, about adopting
his guinea pig?

23:00.113 --> 23:03.013
Yes. You're not really
gonna do that, are you?

23:03.015 --> 23:06.650
But it worked, right?
He feels better.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.152
I can't lie to my patients,

23:08.154 --> 23:10.888
And that means that
you can't lie to him with me.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.457
The most important part
of my care is trust.

23:13.459 --> 23:16.560
Dr. Murphy, we give patients
placebos--sugar pills.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.463
They heal. They feel better.
That is good medicine, too.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.700
Okay, this man walter--

23:22.702 --> 23:23.868
Everything that he said
about that guinea pig

23:23.870 --> 23:25.169
Is true about him.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.605
He was abandoned
by his mother.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.607
He was malnourished,
incommunicative.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.642
His adoptive parents
gave him one-tenth

23:31.644 --> 23:33.043
Of the love and encouragement
that he needed

23:33.045 --> 23:36.013
To be a healthy man with
healthy attachments to people.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.616
Guilt trip received.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.684
Okay, now I'm gonna have to give
that guinea pig back to him,

23:40.686 --> 23:42.953
And everything we worked on
is gonna backslide.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.622
He may not ever part with it
again.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.623
You gonna waste time
backsliding?

23:45.625 --> 23:48.793
Right now your patient is
on his way to being healed.

23:48.795 --> 23:52.163
That is your choice.

23:54.866 --> 23:57.735
(telephone ringing in distance)

23:57.737 --> 23:58.936
(horn honks in distance)

23:58.938 --> 24:00.971
(clears throat)

24:00.973 --> 24:03.507
You canceled the study.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.743
Shahir, won't you come in?

24:05.745 --> 24:09.180
I <i>am</i> in. Joel, I don't
understand your decision.

24:09.182 --> 24:10.848
Your patient fell.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.584
She's your patient, too.
She may have
sprained her wrist.

24:13.586 --> 24:16.153
Yes, because she's old.
She has parkinson's.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.988
But soon she'll be frozen.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.191
She won't be able to move
at all.

24:20.193 --> 24:22.059
Well, a bicycle ride's hardly
gonna change anything, is it?

24:22.061 --> 24:25.029
I mean, I...
It feels a little pointless.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.664
It's not pointless, joel.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.599
(sighs)

24:28.601 --> 24:30.701
I believe if a patient seeks
treatment early enough,

24:30.703 --> 24:33.704
Cycling can be just as effective
as deep brain stimulation.
You injured your patient.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.972
It was minor.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.907
Okay, if hope zion
is spending money,

24:36.909 --> 24:39.677
I wanna see concrete results
and no lawsuits.

24:42.914 --> 24:44.215
So then
the outdoor component--

24:44.217 --> 24:47.551
That's--that's out
of the question.

24:47.553 --> 24:48.752
Is it?

24:48.754 --> 24:52.790
I'm sorry, shahir. I...
Mm. I feel bad.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.558
Nah. You don't feel bad.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.528
You don't feel anything.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.597
Trust me, I'm a bit
of an expert on that.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.066
But, see, I-I have asperger's.
What's your excuse?

25:04.169 --> 25:06.270
<i>Three months</i>

25:06.272 --> 25:08.105
<i>You were stuck like this</i>
<i>wandering these halls?</i>

25:08.107 --> 25:10.774
Yep. Alex was here
fighting for my life,

25:10.776 --> 25:13.277
Searching for a way
to bring me back.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.113
<i>(sighs) well, I'm dead,</i>
<i>charlie. There's...</i>

25:16.115 --> 25:18.215
<i>There's no coming back</i>
<i>from this.</i>

25:18.217 --> 25:21.051
I know.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.754
<i>I'm worried about her.</i>

25:23.756 --> 25:26.757
She always felt responsible
for you.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.526
I think in a way
she feels like

25:28.528 --> 25:30.928
She let you down.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.697
<i>Maybe that's it. Maybe that's</i>
<i>why I'm still here.</i>

25:33.699 --> 25:35.833
<i>Maybe it's my turn</i>
<i>to take care of her.</i>

25:35.835 --> 25:37.034
<i>And when I know</i>
<i>that she's okay,</i>

25:37.036 --> 25:38.869
<i>I'll--I'll move on.</i>

25:38.871 --> 25:41.171
That could take a while,
luke.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.173
<i>Right?</i>

25:43.175 --> 25:45.175
In the meantime, let's, um,

25:45.177 --> 25:47.645
Let's try
this funeral home release.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.812
Couldn't hurt, right?

25:48.814 --> 25:50.814
<i>Baby steps.</i>

25:50.816 --> 25:51.782
Get her to sign it
when I see her,

25:51.784 --> 25:54.685
And we'll see what happens.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.954
<i>Thanks.</i>

25:56.956 --> 26:00.591
<i>I really appreciate you</i>
<i>helping me figure this out.</i>

26:00.593 --> 26:04.628
Hey, man, this is
apparently what I do.

26:07.265 --> 26:08.666
Charlie.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.734
Hey! I was, uh...

26:10.736 --> 26:13.203
We've been paging you.
We need you in the o.R. Now.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.573
Okay.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.141
I'll sign the release.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.312
We need to go.

26:24.215 --> 26:26.216
It's invading the l3?
Yeah, there's no plane.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.885
Well, I can't risk
paralyzing the kid,

26:27.887 --> 26:31.355
Well, we've already cut off
his blood supply to the kidney.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.790
The tumor's rotting.
I can't close him up.

26:32.792 --> 26:33.958
He'll die of sepsis.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.125
Well, I'll take a look, alex,

26:35.127 --> 26:36.627
But I can't promise you
anything.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.128
Charlie, I need this
to work.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.830
I know you do, but I don't
wanna do more harm than good.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.832
I was wrong
getting us into this surgery.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.200
That's what you're thinking.

26:43.202 --> 26:48.038
We can fix him.
We can't let him die, charlie.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.207
He's 7 years old.
It'll kill his father.
I... (sighs)

26:50.209 --> 26:51.942
Could you go in
from the back?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.877
Uh... I can't access the tumor
that way,

26:53.879 --> 26:55.212
But I...
But what?

27:00.385 --> 27:02.653
Sats and pressure are lousy.
He's fluid overloaded.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.722
(alex) well, we've got a plan.
Charlie does.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.056
(charlie) laminectomy.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.958
Go in from the back.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.259
Expose his spinal cord,
which is... (inhales deeply)

27:09.261 --> 27:10.961
Like shaving a balloon,
but then someone will have

27:10.963 --> 27:12.229
To hold the spine
out of the way

27:12.231 --> 27:13.764
While I blindly chisel
the cancer off the spine

27:13.766 --> 27:14.965
From the front.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.001
You better be able
to do this.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.970
(monitor beeps)

27:19.972 --> 27:21.972
Page dana
so we can close him up fast.

27:21.974 --> 27:22.973
Right.

27:26.211 --> 27:27.211
Charlie.
(scrubbing hands)

27:27.213 --> 27:28.278
Yeah?

27:30.048 --> 27:31.115
Nothing.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.421
Reycraft, you sure
this is the right level?

27:37.423 --> 27:39.890
Yes. L3. We landmarked it.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.892
His sats are dropping,
and his b-pressure's way up.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.961
Ballpark timeline?
I can stabilize him for now,

27:43.963 --> 27:45.396
But we can't keep him under
much longer.

27:45.398 --> 27:49.400
Okay. All right. Reycraft,
retract the dura carefully.

27:49.402 --> 27:51.769
It's like tissue paper. Alex?

27:51.771 --> 27:52.870
(alex clears throat)

27:52.872 --> 27:55.339
(beeps)

27:55.341 --> 27:58.175
I need an osteotome
and a mallet, please.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.343
(alex) I'll suction.

28:03.114 --> 28:05.983
(suction gurgling)

28:11.356 --> 28:15.259
(tapping)

28:17.929 --> 28:19.730
Charlie, stop, stop.

28:19.732 --> 28:23.067
I think you might have nicked
the spinal cord.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.736
(inhales deeply)

28:25.738 --> 28:27.738
Yeah, I can see the tear.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.339
Put him in trendelenburg.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.741
(beeps)

28:30.743 --> 28:31.942
Loupes.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.343
(beeps)

28:33.345 --> 28:35.813
(sighs)

28:38.316 --> 28:41.418
Yeah, I see a 5-millimeter tear
of the dura.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.287
Spinal cord and nerves
look intact.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.956
Uh, victor, 6-0 monofilament.
Coming.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.291
How's it looking, charlie?

28:47.293 --> 28:49.960
I'll know in a minute.

29:04.776 --> 29:08.245
(monitor beeps)

29:15.987 --> 29:17.287
Scissors.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.022
(snip)

29:21.259 --> 29:24.962
Okay, let's see if that holds.
George, lower the table.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.029
Yeah.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.498
(table whirs)

29:27.500 --> 29:30.467
(monitor beeps)

29:30.469 --> 29:33.070
Okay, it's holding.
No leak.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.938
Let's get this tumor out.

29:36.141 --> 29:39.076
Dr. Hamza says you're
canceling the study.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.478
I am. It was far too expensive
for the hospital,

29:41.480 --> 29:45.149
And I... Anyway, I would like
to take this opportunity

29:45.151 --> 29:46.984
To apologize to you again.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.252
Don't.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.953
I had fun.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.221
You put yourself
through a lot

29:51.223 --> 29:53.891
For a therapy with
no long-term benefits.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.293
Long-term?
Mm-hmm.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.363
In the long-term,
my brain runs out of dopamine,

29:59.365 --> 30:02.232
I don't move again.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.869
I can't... Think
long-term.

30:05.871 --> 30:08.172
(siren wailing in distance)

30:08.174 --> 30:09.573
So tell me...

30:09.575 --> 30:11.308
Why do you do it?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.511
I mean, is it
the social aspect?

30:14.513 --> 30:20.050
Hope. It gave me
so much hope.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.153
When you're trapped,

30:23.155 --> 30:25.155
Tiny moments of freedom
mean a lot.

30:29.160 --> 30:33.063
I'll get a nurse in here.

30:33.065 --> 30:36.200
How much does the study cost,
anyway?

30:37.368 --> 30:38.569
Why?

30:38.571 --> 30:43.574
I won 500 bucks
on a scratch ticket.

30:43.576 --> 30:46.176
I'd throw it in
if that would help.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.389
Walter, you know how we've been
discussing your self-esteem

30:59.391 --> 31:02.059
And how it's easier for you
to stay home with vallenwe'en

31:02.061 --> 31:04.161
And take care of her
than to go out

31:04.163 --> 31:07.364
And how socially, your
experience is feeling withdrawn?
Yeah.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.999
And I'm gonna work on that,

31:09.001 --> 31:11.168
Now that vallenwe'en
has a home.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.238
(exhales) well, actually,
walter, about that, um...

31:14.240 --> 31:17.374
I've got a good feeling
about that doctor.

31:17.376 --> 31:23.380
She's a heart doctor,
and she is so beautiful.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.215
Walter, wait. Uh--

31:25.217 --> 31:28.952
I gotta say, I love
that guinea pig so much,

31:28.954 --> 31:32.222
But I can't believe
how nice it feels

31:32.224 --> 31:35.559
To give it to the doctor
who fixed my heart.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.562
Well...

31:38.564 --> 31:40.397
Walter... (sighs)

31:40.399 --> 31:43.100
Dr. Bell and I discussed
the real issues

31:43.102 --> 31:45.469
That surround her
taking a guinea pig.

31:45.471 --> 31:48.138
Considering her busy schedule,
and, um--

31:48.140 --> 31:50.307
And we decided that at my house

31:50.309 --> 31:53.477
Vallenwe'en would be left alone
for too many hours of the day,

31:53.479 --> 31:55.045
And the last time
that I checked,

31:55.047 --> 31:57.014
My neighborhood doesn't
have a guinea pig watcher.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.316
(chuckles)

31:59.318 --> 32:02.052
So dr. Murphy suggested
that I make a home

32:02.054 --> 32:04.488
For vallenwe'en in my office.

32:04.490 --> 32:10.060
And my office has
a south-facing window,

32:10.062 --> 32:12.062
So she'll get lots of light.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.998
Dr. Bell, how can I ever
thank you?

32:16.367 --> 32:18.368
Wow, dr. Bell.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.437
You can thank me by coming
to visit vallenwe'en,

32:20.439 --> 32:21.672
Keep her company.

32:21.674 --> 32:23.941
(gavin) really?
I will.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.476
Not every day,
right, dr. Murphy?

32:26.478 --> 32:29.613
We'll talk
about what works for you.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.181
(monitor beeps)

32:36.521 --> 32:38.055
Yes, joel?

32:38.057 --> 32:41.525
It's a nice, tidy office,
man.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.694
Yeah, I don't like to be
distracted from my work.

32:43.696 --> 32:45.362
Look...

32:45.364 --> 32:50.367
Essentially, you said
something to me earlier--

32:50.369 --> 32:53.103
That I don't have any feelings,
and, um...

32:53.105 --> 32:56.506
(sighs) you know,
I do have feelings, okay?

32:56.508 --> 33:01.345
I-I... I just can't
necessarily, um... Express them

33:01.347 --> 33:03.480
As the chief of surgery.

33:07.385 --> 33:08.719
Are you...

33:08.721 --> 33:11.088
Coming on to me, joel?

33:13.391 --> 33:14.391
100% no.
Oh.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.459
I am not coming on to you.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.294
I don't know how
you arrived at that.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.662
That's--
because the...

33:18.664 --> 33:20.263
I...
Way you were...

33:20.265 --> 33:22.132
Yeah, okay...
Not at all.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.667
I'm sorry that--
I mean, did you--

33:23.669 --> 33:26.069
No, I don't have
those feelings for you at all.
Why would you?

33:26.071 --> 33:27.404
Oh, please,
get over yourself.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.239
I just misread social
and emotional cues sometimes,

33:29.241 --> 33:33.276
So let's just forget
that even happened.
Didn't happen.

33:33.278 --> 33:34.611
Great.
I came here
to ask you something.

33:34.613 --> 33:37.147
Then just ask it, please.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.016
You know what?
Just come with me.

33:40.485 --> 33:43.320
Are we ready to deliver
this bad boy?

33:43.322 --> 33:45.255
(alex) okay, we're gonna have
to do this with kid gloves.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.624
Okay, moment of truth.
(exhales)

33:47.626 --> 33:50.560
Okay, the tumor's free
on all sides.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.396
Alex, you should do
the honors.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.364
Actually, maggie, you should.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.200
Okay. (sighs)

33:57.202 --> 34:00.303
Okay, here goes.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.471
(squish)

34:01.473 --> 34:02.506
Okay.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.307
(victor) it's a boy!

34:04.309 --> 34:05.442
(alex)
actually, her name's marla.

34:05.444 --> 34:10.680
(chuckles)
(dana) okay, people, we're gonna
have one hell of a hole to fill.

34:10.682 --> 34:13.550
I want a sterile marker
and as much 2-0 prolene

34:13.552 --> 34:15.452
As this hospital's got.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.187
Jeez, look at that.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.655
(alex grunts)
(thud)

34:18.657 --> 34:20.390
Alex!
Hey.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.658
(gloves snap)

34:31.335 --> 34:32.702
You scared me in there.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.306
I'm just tired.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.442
You were phenomenal today.
Thank you.

34:38.444 --> 34:41.411
I'm pregnant.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.648
(whispers) that's great.

34:44.650 --> 34:49.753
(sighs) I, um, I've been
keeping it secret.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.722
Just... Needed to hear it
out loud once again.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.093
Gavin doesn't know?

34:56.095 --> 35:00.464
Can't... Seem to find
the right moment.

35:00.466 --> 35:04.167
There never really is
a right moment.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.837
Speaking of which,
I'm sorry.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.806
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm...

35:09.808 --> 35:13.243
With luke's death
and everything, and...

35:13.245 --> 35:15.779
No, it's okay.

35:15.781 --> 35:19.416
I needed some good news.
(chuckles)

35:21.385 --> 35:24.287
Just take some time off.
Go somewhere quiet.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.856
Mm.
Let charlie take care of you.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.592
Tell gavin.

35:28.594 --> 35:31.361
He loves you.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.630
He can handle
anything you throw at him.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.799
I hope so.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.268
Mm-hmm.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.437
Hi.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.638
You okay?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.273
I don't know.

35:51.782 --> 35:53.550
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:53.552 --> 35:55.218
Hey, lou.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.586
Where's your dad?

35:56.588 --> 35:57.821
(pen clicks)

35:57.823 --> 36:01.158
On the phone
with my uncle casey

36:01.160 --> 36:03.927
And before that, my nan,
and my aunt jane.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.428
He's excited.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.730
Duh.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.365
Well,
who can blame him, lou?

36:08.367 --> 36:10.267
Your surgery was a bit
of a miracle.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.334
What's a miracle?

36:13.804 --> 36:16.873
Let's just say that somebody
will be writing another paper.

36:22.213 --> 36:23.313
Hey.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.848
(chair wheels roll)

36:24.850 --> 36:26.383
What's wrong?

36:29.220 --> 36:31.555
I'm a good listener.

36:31.557 --> 36:35.625
Well, do you think
my dad will still like me

36:35.627 --> 36:38.461
When I'm better?

36:38.463 --> 36:41.598
Absolutely.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.234
What do you think
we'll do together?

36:44.236 --> 36:45.902
(inhales)

36:45.904 --> 36:47.504
Hey...

36:47.506 --> 36:49.506
Do you think that the--

36:49.508 --> 36:51.575
The tumor brought
the two of you together?

36:53.344 --> 36:55.512
Yeah. Now that it's gone,
you're a bit worried?

36:55.514 --> 36:56.947
After my mom died,

36:56.949 --> 36:59.783
We never went to the zoo
or anything.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.519
We will now.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.588
(chair wheels roll)

37:04.590 --> 37:07.591
I'm not going anywhere,
son.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.728
Make sure he gets some rest,
huh?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.630
I'll watch "shark rescue."

37:13.632 --> 37:16.766
He always falls asleep
during "shark rescue."

37:16.768 --> 37:19.002
(chuckles) good idea.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.805
What do you think
our new thing should be?

37:21.807 --> 37:23.373
Sharks.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.941
Sharks?

37:24.943 --> 37:26.676
(chuckles)

37:28.279 --> 37:29.346
Hey.

37:31.916 --> 37:32.983
I've been looking for you.

37:32.985 --> 37:33.984
<i>Yeah?</i>

37:36.254 --> 37:37.887
Alex signed the release.

37:37.889 --> 37:42.525
Your body should be on its way
to the funeral home soon.

37:42.527 --> 37:43.727
<i>Good.</i>

37:43.729 --> 37:46.329
She's letting go of you
and her grief.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.900
I know it's a baby step,
but...

37:50.902 --> 37:52.035
It's still a step, right?

37:52.037 --> 37:53.470
<i>Charlie--</i>

37:53.472 --> 37:58.375
I don't think that you need
to watch over her anymore.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.576
She's gonna be okay.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.878
<i>No, she's not.</i>

38:03.714 --> 38:06.650
<i>If you told her the truth...</i>

38:06.652 --> 38:07.951
<i>About what you can do,</i>

38:07.953 --> 38:10.487
<i>Told her everything,</i>

38:10.489 --> 38:12.622
<i>Didn't hold back,</i>

38:12.624 --> 38:14.724
<i>What would she do?</i>

38:14.726 --> 38:18.995
She'd try to fix--

38:21.766 --> 38:23.900
She'd try to fix me...

38:25.936 --> 38:29.339
(sighs) no matter what toll
it took on her.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.880
You think you're here
to protect her from me?

38:36.882 --> 38:42.018
I would never hurt her,
luke.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.887
<i>Not on purpose.</i>
<i>I know that.</i>

38:43.889 --> 38:46.523
<i>I know that.</i>

38:46.525 --> 38:48.758
<i>But you and I both know</i>

38:48.760 --> 38:51.661
<i>What she'd do</i>
<i>if you told her.</i>

38:55.533 --> 38:56.866
(sighs)

39:06.844 --> 39:10.013
What are you gonna do?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.381
Uh...

39:11.383 --> 39:12.916
<i>(sighs)</i>

39:12.918 --> 39:18.488
Well, I guess I need
to remove the problem.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.957
En bloc, right?

39:24.095 --> 39:27.497
Think you're free to go.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.532
<i>Yeah. (inhales deeply)</i>

39:29.534 --> 39:32.635
<i>Yeah, I think it's time,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

39:32.637 --> 39:35.038
<i>(sighs)</i>

39:35.040 --> 39:38.808
<i>You know, there's actually</i>
<i>a really nice place</i>

39:38.810 --> 39:40.543
<i>Out on mimico creek.</i>

39:40.545 --> 39:42.679
(reuben and the dark's
"shoulderblade" playing)

39:42.681 --> 39:46.616
â™ª I'm trying not to try

39:46.618 --> 39:53.156
â™ª this fire was here
before you and I â™ª

39:53.158 --> 39:58.161
â™ª and I've seen it all before

39:58.163 --> 40:03.600
â™ª through a crack in the wall
and umbilical cord â™ª

40:03.602 --> 40:09.472
â™ª hide your love
inside my head â™ª

40:09.474 --> 40:14.043
â™ª

40:20.551 --> 40:22.819
Ida? Okay?

40:22.821 --> 40:24.454
Mm-hmm.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.623
Okay. Follow me.

40:26.625 --> 40:31.161
â™ª wanna be the only thing
on your mind â™ª

40:31.163 --> 40:36.666
â™ª I'm trying to change

40:36.668 --> 40:39.702
â™ª but you cut like a cold
(giggles)

40:39.704 --> 40:41.604
â™ª shoulderblade

40:41.606 --> 40:44.574
â™ª hide your love inside

40:44.576 --> 40:47.010
â™ª my head

40:47.012 --> 40:48.611
Hey, gavin.

40:48.613 --> 40:49.779
Maggie.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.781
I'm pregnant.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.882
Huh? Whoa! (grunts)

40:58.656 --> 41:03.893
â™ª tell me which is which

41:03.895 --> 41:07.697
â™ª prepare my heart for this

41:10.768 --> 41:16.506
â™ª and call me out

41:16.508 --> 41:20.643
â™ª quiet heart

41:20.645 --> 41:23.012
â™ª and I'll say

41:28.085 --> 41:33.723
â™ª I feel like a wrecking ball

41:33.725 --> 41:39.128
â™ª with bottles of alcohol

41:39.130 --> 41:43.933
â™ª but when will the dawn break

41:43.935 --> 41:46.836
â™ª even again?

41:55.779 --> 41:57.180
I saw you...

41:57.182 --> 41:59.282
Talking to yourself.

41:59.284 --> 42:02.685
I... I don't know
what it is.

42:02.687 --> 42:05.989
If you... Really do
see things.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.924
I'll fight, charlie.
I'll fight for us.

42:07.926 --> 42:09.926
I'll... I'll fight
for <i>you.</i>

42:09.928 --> 42:13.763
I know.
I know you will.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.232
That's the problem.

42:16.234 --> 42:17.934
Problem?

42:17.936 --> 42:22.805
(huffs)
what are you saying?

42:29.680 --> 42:31.648
God, I love you.

42:31.650 --> 42:35.051
Then talk to me.

42:42.126 --> 42:46.930
I need to fix myself...
By myself.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.101
Charlie?

42:57.608 --> 42:58.808
(gasps)

43:02.146 --> 43:03.212
I should go.

43:07.718 --> 43:08.952
(sighs)
