00:09.538 --> 00:13.834
<i>Once upon a Croodaceus period,
I had a family.</i>

00:15.168 --> 00:17.754
<i>And my family had a Thunk,</i>

00:17.838 --> 00:20.923
<i>and Thunk was way different
from everyone else.</i>

00:21.758 --> 00:24.889
<i>But every now and then,
something would happen</i>

00:24.924 --> 00:27.806
<i>that let us see things
the way he saw them.</i>

00:27.889 --> 00:30.141
<i>And that was always the start</i>

00:30.142 --> 00:33.520
<i>of an exciting new chapter in our story.</i>

00:33.603 --> 00:38.483
So I got up from the sleep pile
and heard the growl a third time.

00:39.901 --> 00:43.279
<i>It was the monster.
He was close, very close.</i>

00:45.448 --> 00:49.041
And that's when I realized the growl
was coming from inside...

00:49.089 --> 00:51.496
my stomach!

00:57.711 --> 01:01.795
- Must kill Grug's stomach!
- But I ate breakfast

01:01.830 --> 01:03.675
and the monster went
away forever. The end.

01:06.595 --> 01:10.557
- Awesome ending, Dad.
- Yeah. Good save, honey.

01:10.640 --> 01:13.976
This might be our first story night
that doesn't end in bloodshed.

01:14.060 --> 01:15.937
<i>Uh, guys?</i>

01:16.020 --> 01:19.858
Can I try telling a story?
I think I got a really good one.

01:19.941 --> 01:21.984
Really, Thunk?
Well, okay.

01:22.068 --> 01:25.530
Hey, my son's gonna tell
his first story-night story.

01:28.241 --> 01:30.827
So, let's take it easy on him, okay?

01:38.376 --> 01:40.336
All right, here goes.

01:40.420 --> 01:44.319
Once upon a time, there
lived a great adventurer named

01:44.320 --> 01:48.219
Hunk Tugg-alug, and he was
everyone's favorite hero.

01:48.303 --> 01:52.348
In fact, he was so popular
that even the grass would say,

01:52.432 --> 01:54.559
"Thanks for stepping on us, Hunk."

01:54.643 --> 01:58.246
One day, Hunk was hunting for magic eggs

01:58.247 --> 02:00.649
inside a scary volcano.

02:00.732 --> 02:04.778
"This will be our best adventure yet,"
said Hunk's friend Mute,

02:04.861 --> 02:06.780
the rainbow-colored bear owl.

02:06.863 --> 02:09.532
And with a mighty shout,
Hunk replied...

02:09.616 --> 02:14.412
Liar! He's lying.
Not a word of this story is real.

02:14.496 --> 02:17.529
Not the talking bear owl,
not the manly hero,

02:17.564 --> 02:18.959
who makes me wish
I didn't already have a husband.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.919
- Hey.
- It's all lies!

02:21.002 --> 02:23.604
Sweetie, I think what
Meep is trying to say is

02:23.605 --> 02:25.340
we're just a little confused.

02:25.423 --> 02:28.259
Exactly how did you meet
this Hunk Tugg-alug?

02:28.343 --> 02:30.887
Oh, I never met him, Mom.
Nobody has.

02:32.472 --> 02:35.725
A-ha! He admits it.
He is lying.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.022
Whoa!
My brother is not a liar.

02:41.105 --> 02:44.526
If Thunk says all that stuff
happened, then it happened.

02:44.609 --> 02:46.569
Yeah, it happened.

02:46.653 --> 02:48.321
- In my head.
- Huh?

02:48.404 --> 02:50.532
- In your head?
- Yeah.

02:50.615 --> 02:53.201
That's where I see all my stories,
in my make-stuff-up place.

02:53.284 --> 02:57.246
Oh, the boy just sees
things that don't exist,

02:57.247 --> 03:01.209
like a crazy person.
Well, in that case, run!

03:03.378 --> 03:08.132
So, magic eggs, you say.
Go on!

03:13.238 --> 03:16.097
<b>1x05 - "The First Picture Show"</b>

03:20.566 --> 03:21.938
Huh, let's see.

03:22.022 --> 03:25.608
No adventurers.
No grouchy lizvults.

03:26.776 --> 03:29.988
You did say you see all of these
things in your head, right, Thunk?

03:30.070 --> 03:31.447
- Uh-huh.
- Wait, now,

03:31.531 --> 03:32.824
you see that dangly throat thing?

03:32.908 --> 03:36.202
If you squint, it kinda looks
like a rainbow-colored bear owl.

03:36.285 --> 03:37.913
Nah, you've got one of those, too.

03:37.996 --> 03:39.581
I stare at it whenever you yell at us.

03:39.664 --> 03:43.418
- It's a riot.
- Well, then where are they?

03:43.501 --> 03:47.630
<i>Hey! All you people,
we know you're in there.</i>

03:47.714 --> 03:51.342
- Now, get!
- Come out, come out, come out!

03:52.427 --> 03:54.637
Grug, put your son down, please.

03:54.721 --> 03:57.557
But, Mom, we're just trying
to find my make-stuff-up place.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.474
<i>Yeah!</i>

03:58.558 --> 04:01.978
'Cause then I could show people
where my stories come from.

04:02.062 --> 04:02.896
<i>Yeah!</i>

04:02.979 --> 04:04.731
And then they'll like my stories.

04:04.814 --> 04:05.732
<i>Yeah!</i>

04:05.815 --> 04:07.233
- Ehh...
- I wouldn't...

04:07.316 --> 04:08.902
- Don't count on it.
- ...count on that.

04:08.985 --> 04:11.195
- Oh.
- It's okay, Thunk.

04:11.279 --> 04:13.823
You just think different
and that's great.

04:13.907 --> 04:16.952
It scares everyone else,
but it's great.

04:17.035 --> 04:20.495
I think I need some time alone.
Can I go for a walk?

04:23.875 --> 04:26.210
Oops. You used the "walk" word.

04:26.294 --> 04:28.463
Take your sister along, okay, son?

04:35.386 --> 04:36.638
You know, I hate this.

04:36.721 --> 04:39.015
Bonk the neighbors
for making Thunk feel so bad.

04:39.099 --> 04:42.060
If I was a meaner person,
I'd be planning my revenge right now.

04:42.143 --> 04:45.855
Well, I am a meaner person,
so let's do this.

04:50.026 --> 04:53.154
Sandy, I wish there was
some way to show everybody

04:53.237 --> 04:55.991
all of these fun stories
I got in my head, you know?

05:00.662 --> 05:02.622
What do you see, Sandy?

05:05.583 --> 05:06.793
Is...

05:07.961 --> 05:09.963
Is that me?

<i>Hey!</i>

05:26.062 --> 05:28.606
Ooh, giant fish!

05:29.065 --> 05:30.150
Hmm.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.616
Giant lizvult! Kill it!

05:41.243 --> 05:45.414
Don't be afraid.
Amber protect you.

05:49.711 --> 05:52.588
Death bird have no weaknesses.

05:52.672 --> 05:56.176
Every caveman for self!

05:56.258 --> 05:58.928
Boys, family panic formation!

06:06.936 --> 06:10.606
Thunk, Sandy, there's a lizvult
on the rampage. Get inside now.

06:10.690 --> 06:14.234
Sorry. Can't stop now.
I'm in the middle of my story.

06:14.318 --> 06:18.823
Thunk Ooga Booga Crood,
when we say get inside, that means...

06:19.615 --> 06:21.409
Whoa!

06:25.371 --> 06:27.082
<i>Back, beast, back!</i>

06:40.678 --> 06:43.765
You're no match for Hunk Tugg-alug.

06:43.848 --> 06:45.975
<i>Whoa!</i>

06:49.771 --> 06:52.065
My hero.

06:58.988 --> 07:03.118
- Ow! He's... He's not real.
- Not real?

07:03.201 --> 07:06.162
But I can see him with my
own eyes, which, I will note,

07:06.246 --> 07:09.290
can see in both
daytime and nighttime.

07:09.373 --> 07:14.336
Look. It's Thunk.
He's making it with his hands.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.881
<i>You sure showed that lizvult, Hunk.</i>

07:16.965 --> 07:19.634
<i>Thanks, Mute, my multi-colored chum.</i>

07:19.717 --> 07:22.137
<i>Now to find those magic eggs.</i>

07:24.680 --> 07:28.434
Thunk, we are sorry
for calling you a liar.

07:28.517 --> 07:31.395
Please don't sic your
horrible shadow people on us.

07:31.479 --> 07:32.480
Meep!

07:32.563 --> 07:35.858
She meant lovely shadow people.

07:35.942 --> 07:40.196
No, they're not real.
I'm just using shadows to tell a story.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.865
First, I see Hunk in my head.

07:42.949 --> 07:45.076
<i>Hello, Ahhh! Valley.</i>

07:45.160 --> 07:48.704
- And then, I use my hands to...
- No more explain.

07:48.788 --> 07:50.498
Bring back Hunk Tugg-alug.

07:50.581 --> 07:53.876
Amber just wanna know
what happen next!

07:53.960 --> 07:56.296
<i>Yeah! What happens next?</i>

07:56.378 --> 07:59.425
<i>What happens next?
What happens next?</i>

07:59.460 --> 08:02.135
What happens next, huh?

08:02.218 --> 08:05.429
Eep, come here.
You're Hunk's girlfriend, Pretty.

08:05.513 --> 08:07.640
What?

08:07.723 --> 08:10.143
<i>Oh... Oh!</i>

08:10.643 --> 08:14.897
<i>I'm Hunk's girlfriend, Pretty.</i>

08:14.981 --> 08:19.735
Well, well. Amber think
this just get interesting.

08:19.819 --> 08:22.711
<i>Oh, no, Pretty's on
the other side of this volcano</i>

08:22.712 --> 08:24.157
<i>filled with bubbling lava.</i>

08:24.240 --> 08:26.575
Dad, bubbling lava.

08:26.659 --> 08:30.496
Uh, uh, bubble, bubble, bubble!

08:30.579 --> 08:32.498
No, don't say "bubble."

08:32.581 --> 08:35.458
Oh, oh, uh...

08:35.543 --> 08:37.461
Mom, music.

08:41.423 --> 08:45.594
<i>Pretty, I knew from the time
that you ate more eggs than me</i>

08:45.678 --> 08:48.389
<i>that you were my true love.
I'll save you.</i>

08:48.472 --> 08:50.516
<i>Mute, get ready to jump.</i>

08:50.599 --> 08:52.185
<i>But how, Hunk?</i>

08:52.268 --> 08:55.771
<i>With the power of a running start.</i>

08:55.855 --> 08:57.815
They'll never make it!

09:02.444 --> 09:04.280
Ha, I knew they'd make it.

09:04.364 --> 09:08.034
Oh, Hunk, you're my hero!

09:08.117 --> 09:11.162
<i>Kiss me, Pretty,
by putting our lips together,</i>

09:11.246 --> 09:13.873
<i>'cause that's how that works, right?</i>

09:13.956 --> 09:17.377
Ugh! Ew, brother cooties.

09:17.459 --> 09:20.338
<i>Aww.</i>

09:20.421 --> 09:24.092
Oh, good for those two, right, Grug?

09:24.175 --> 09:27.345
- Grug?
- It's just a beautiful story.

09:28.637 --> 09:30.556
Uh-oh. Do you feel that, Hunk?

09:30.639 --> 09:32.474
<i>It sort of feels like...</i>

09:40.649 --> 09:42.484
<i>An earthquake!</i>

09:44.279 --> 09:46.530
<i>Oh, no, I can't hold on.</i>

09:46.614 --> 09:49.033
<i>And this volcano is going to blow.</i>

09:49.117 --> 09:52.203
Will our heroes survive?

09:52.287 --> 09:54.205
Will Hunk and Pretty get married?

09:54.289 --> 09:55.456
Yeah!

09:55.539 --> 09:57.083
Will Mute forgive himself

09:57.166 --> 10:00.211
for all of the cavemen he ate
as a young bear owl?

10:00.295 --> 10:02.213
<i>Oh, the things I've done!</i>

10:02.297 --> 10:04.332
<i>Find out tomorrow night</i>

10:04.333 --> 10:07.385
<i>in The Adventures of Hunk Tugg-alug!</i>

10:11.097 --> 10:12.890
- All right!
- Yeah!

10:18.271 --> 10:22.524
Well, son, I don't know what you
did, but you definitely did it!

10:22.608 --> 10:26.237
I did it! I finally showed everyone
what's in my head.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.864
I wonder if things will be different now.

10:30.074 --> 10:33.411
Thanks to Thunk's stories,
everyone can fly now.

10:39.459 --> 10:41.502
Eh, probably not that different.

10:45.381 --> 10:50.345
<i>Class, I know today's lesson
was supposed to be how not to die,</i>

10:50.428 --> 10:54.682
but we have something
far more important to talk about.

10:54.765 --> 10:58.353
How will Hunk Tugg-alug
get out of that volcano?

10:58.853 --> 11:00.188
<i>Yeah!</i>

11:00.271 --> 11:02.190
Sorry. I can't tell.

11:02.273 --> 11:06.152
You're just gonna have to wait.

11:06.235 --> 11:09.613
But I want to know now!

11:11.615 --> 11:13.117
Eh.

11:20.082 --> 11:21.334
There you are!

11:22.626 --> 11:25.671
Lerk, what did we say about
sneaking up on me?

11:25.754 --> 11:27.507
This isn't about you, Eep.

11:27.589 --> 11:32.261
This is about you, Thunk.
We love your stories.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.973
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

11:36.598 --> 11:38.642
More than life itself.

11:40.186 --> 11:41.396
Really?

11:41.479 --> 11:46.108
So, Thunk, Hunk sprouts wings
to get out of that volcano, right?

11:46.192 --> 11:47.651
Right?

11:47.735 --> 11:50.612
You don't really want me
to spoil my story, do you?

11:50.696 --> 11:53.032
Yes, I do. Tell me.
Tell me!

11:54.409 --> 11:59.258
Okay, we're getting a little excited.
That's enough for today.

12:01.916 --> 12:03.709
- Thunk!
- Just one more question!

12:05.169 --> 12:06.670
Let's sleep here till he comes out.

12:06.754 --> 12:09.465
<i>Yeah!</i>

12:10.883 --> 12:12.134
So, tell me, Thunk...

12:12.218 --> 12:15.054
- How did you get in here?
- How will Hunk escape that volcano?

12:15.137 --> 12:17.432
- Hmm?
- Uh...

12:17.515 --> 12:18.598
Huh? Whoa!

12:21.018 --> 12:22.270
Whoa!

12:22.353 --> 12:27.358
- I have fans? Neat!
- Did we see the same fans?

12:43.291 --> 12:46.168
Okay, it's time.
Everybody ready?

12:49.422 --> 12:52.237
<i>Now, another exciting story from</i>

12:52.238 --> 12:55.052
<i>The Adventures of Hunk Tugg-alug.</i>

12:55.136 --> 12:57.221
Last time we saw our heroes,

12:57.305 --> 13:02.143
<i>they were holding on for dear life
over an erupting volcano.</i>

13:02.226 --> 13:05.645
Suddenly, Hunk realized
what he needed to do.

13:05.729 --> 13:09.233
<i>Wait. I suddenly
realized what I need to do.</i>

13:09.317 --> 13:11.110
<i>What is it, Hunk?</i>

13:11.193 --> 13:14.322
<i>Well, you guys know
how my insides are made of ice</i>

13:14.405 --> 13:17.325
<i>that's colder than
a thousand glaciers, right?</i>

13:19.160 --> 13:21.078
<i>- Uh-huh. Go on.
- Yeah, of course!</i>

13:21.162 --> 13:25.833
<i>Then you already know
that only I can put out this volcano.</i>

13:25.916 --> 13:29.253
<i>You don't mean...
Hunk, no.</i>

13:29.337 --> 13:32.672
<i>Goodbye, friends.
Goodbye!</i>

13:37.136 --> 13:38.262
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

13:38.346 --> 13:41.307
<i>Hunk sacrificed himself
so we could live.</i>

13:41.390 --> 13:44.185
<i>What a sad
but beautiful thing he did.</i>

13:44.268 --> 13:47.062
<i>The end.</i>

13:49.273 --> 13:51.775
<i>- Boo!
- Boo!</i>

13:54.236 --> 13:58.073
Thunk killed Hunk.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.242
Get him!

14:03.162 --> 14:06.790
Uh-oh. I think another story night
is about to end in total bloodshed.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.835
Wall!

14:15.132 --> 14:17.051
Out of our way, Grug.

14:17.134 --> 14:20.971
Your son killed Hunk Tugg-alug.
Murderer!

14:21.055 --> 14:25.893
No, he didn't kill Hunk Tugg-alug
because Hunk Tugg-alug isn't real.

14:27.603 --> 14:29.813
- What?
- He felt real.

14:29.897 --> 14:34.402
But, uh, the reason Hunk died
is so his friends could live,

14:34.485 --> 14:36.195
and then there's more to the story.

14:36.278 --> 14:39.990
- See, Hunk has a brother.
- Amber don't care about that.

14:40.074 --> 14:43.994
- Amber just want Hunk back.
- But... But he had to go.

14:44.078 --> 14:48.832
He didn't have to go.

14:48.916 --> 14:52.753
I didn't want him to!
It hurts so bad.

14:55.297 --> 14:59.260
It's sad! It's so sad!

14:59.343 --> 15:02.388
And that makes me mad!

15:07.602 --> 15:12.773
Without Hunk Tugg-alug,
all I have is my... my husband!

15:12.856 --> 15:14.692
Hey.

15:17.695 --> 15:19.585
Look, Croods, uh, I
don't wanna panic you,

15:19.586 --> 15:20.531
but this is getting ugly.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.033
I've never seen Sandy
so spooked before.

15:29.373 --> 15:32.627
Any ideas on how
we can get Thunk out of here?

15:32.710 --> 15:35.921
Hey.

15:37.548 --> 15:38.882
- Thunk!
- Thunk!

15:38.966 --> 15:40.635
- Thunk, where are you?
- Thunk, where are you?

15:41.594 --> 15:42.803
- Thunk!
- Thunk!

15:42.886 --> 15:45.514
- Come on, boy.
- Where are you, Thunk?

15:45.598 --> 15:47.642
- Thunk!
- Thunk, come back!

15:47.725 --> 15:51.646
- Hunk killer.
- Where are you, you murderer?

15:51.729 --> 15:55.650
Bring me the hide of the boy
who killed Hunk!

15:55.733 --> 15:57.801
Oh, Grug, it's not safe at night

15:57.802 --> 16:00.904
with all of the bear
owls stalking around.

16:00.988 --> 16:04.742
We never taught Thunk
not to talk to predators.

16:04.825 --> 16:07.453
Don't worry, Ugga.
We'll find him.

16:07.536 --> 16:11.497
Search harder!
We can't let the boy die

16:11.532 --> 16:14.001
before we get a new
version of his story.

16:15.586 --> 16:19.465
I mean, at all.
We can't let the boy die at all.

16:25.179 --> 16:28.974
Thunk, you come out right now.
This is your father...

16:29.057 --> 16:32.102
I mean, this is... dessert.

16:32.186 --> 16:34.689
Yeah, come on out and eat me.
I'm a... I'm a dessert.

16:34.772 --> 16:37.608
Dad, you don't think someone
would actually fall for that, do you?

16:37.692 --> 16:39.109
This is Thunk we're talking about.

16:40.736 --> 16:44.865
Two helpings of dessert, Thunk!
Come and get it!

16:48.828 --> 16:50.954
I'm sorry I killed you, Hunk.

16:51.038 --> 16:54.291
<i>Oh, it's okay, Thunk.
I don't mind.</i>

16:54.375 --> 16:55.959
But everyone else does.

16:56.043 --> 16:59.129
So, I guess I'll have to hide here
for the rest of my life.

16:59.213 --> 17:02.090
<i>Do you really think that's
the best thing to do?</i>

17:02.174 --> 17:04.510
What else can I do, Hunk?

17:04.593 --> 17:07.596
I mean, haven't you ever
been afraid before?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.765
<i>Hm, I'll be straight
with you, Thunk.</i>

17:09.848 --> 17:13.268
<i>Given that I was raised
by man-eating lion apes, no,</i>

17:13.352 --> 17:15.103
<i>I don't think I have been afraid before.</i>

17:15.186 --> 17:16.021
Oh.

17:16.104 --> 17:17.021
<i>Sorry.</i>

17:17.105 --> 17:19.608
<i>I guess I'm sort of blowing it
with the advice-giving, huh?</i>

17:19.692 --> 17:21.943
It's okay.
Your powers are super strength,

17:22.027 --> 17:25.071
being made of ice,
and knowing how to talk to girls,

17:25.155 --> 17:26.781
not giving me advice.

17:26.866 --> 17:30.118
I just wish Mom and Dad were here.
They'd know what to do.

17:30.202 --> 17:32.954
<i>- Thunk!
- Thunk, where are you?</i>

17:33.038 --> 17:35.040
- Mom, Dad!
- Thunk!

17:35.123 --> 17:37.000
I'm so sorry I ran away.

17:37.084 --> 17:40.921
- I just want people to like my stories.
- We know, sweetie,

17:41.004 --> 17:43.674
but you can't worry
about what other people think.

17:43.758 --> 17:47.762
All you can do is share your talent
and hope for the best.

17:47.845 --> 17:49.137
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:49.221 --> 17:53.601
- And never listen to critics.
- That's right. Just moon 'em,

17:53.684 --> 17:57.104
especially the ones that tell you
that you moon things too much.

17:57.187 --> 18:00.065
Okay, Gran has now gone a step too far.

18:00.148 --> 18:02.359
That's usually our signal to wrap it up.

18:02.443 --> 18:05.153
So, what do you say, son?
Should we get out of this cave?

18:05.237 --> 18:07.823
Sure. Actually, I almost left earlier.

18:07.907 --> 18:11.655
There was this dessert
that kept calling my name.

18:12.369 --> 18:14.830
- Hm?
- Okay, then.

18:14.914 --> 18:16.916
- Let's go...
- Bear owls!

18:31.472 --> 18:33.849
Bear owls?
What are we gonna do?

18:33.933 --> 18:35.434
Only one thing to do.

18:35.517 --> 18:39.354
Have Thunk give us a new ending
where Hunk Tugg-alug lives.

18:40.272 --> 18:41.273
No? Hmm.

18:41.356 --> 18:44.568
You have a better way to spend
our time here until we die?

18:44.652 --> 18:48.716
- We're not gonna die here.
- Look, Amber not want to be

18:48.751 --> 18:52.242
"that guy," but we not able
fight that many bear owl.

18:52.326 --> 18:55.203
Need more cavemen.

18:58.791 --> 19:02.461
<i>Did you hear that, Thunk?
She said we need more cavemen.</i>

19:02.544 --> 19:04.797
I have an idea.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.550
But first, I'm gonna have
to teach each of you

19:08.634 --> 19:10.511
how to lend a hand.

19:12.805 --> 19:14.139
- Huh?
- Huh?

19:20.562 --> 19:21.772
Okay, everyone.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.399
Start warming up
your make-stuff-up places.

19:32.783 --> 19:35.452
<i>Squawk.
Loser.</i>

19:36.495 --> 19:39.164
Ooh. Nope, never gonna try that again.

19:52.344 --> 19:53.554
Go! Now!

20:06.650 --> 20:08.944
<i>Stop, villains!</i>

20:09.028 --> 20:12.322
<i>If you want to harm
the people of Ahhh! Valley,</i>

20:12.406 --> 20:14.867
<i>you'll have to go through me first.</i>

20:14.950 --> 20:19.038
<i>And you'll have to go through me second.</i>

20:19.120 --> 20:22.082
<i>And, of course,
you'll have to go through me, too.</i>

20:25.044 --> 20:27.755
<i>- And me.
- Me, too.</i>

20:27.838 --> 20:29.506
Amber say me.

20:29.590 --> 20:31.926
- And also me.
- And me.

20:32.009 --> 20:34.762
And me... I guess.

21:03.749 --> 21:06.752
- Yeah!
- See, sweetie?

21:06.835 --> 21:09.254
Your different way of thinking
saved us all.

21:09.337 --> 21:12.549
Yep. I mean, it also kinda got us
in trouble in the first place,

21:12.633 --> 21:14.301
but hey, way to go, son.

21:14.384 --> 21:17.387
Hey, look.
What is everyone doing?

21:22.726 --> 21:25.104
It looks like they're all making stories.

21:25.186 --> 21:28.983
Remember,
Hunk Tugg-alug doesn't slouch,

21:29.066 --> 21:31.986
because he's the man
my husband can never be.

21:32.069 --> 21:32.945
Hey.

21:33.028 --> 21:37.783
<i>Pretty going out hunting,
not staying home to clean cave.</i>

21:37.866 --> 21:41.787
But look, if I move this finger,
now Hunk has a third arm.

21:41.870 --> 21:43.413
- Whoa!
- No way!

21:43.497 --> 21:44.915
See, Thunk?

21:44.999 --> 21:47.709
Look what happened
when you shared your talent.

21:47.793 --> 21:51.171
Yeah, it made people happy.
Well, some of them.

21:51.254 --> 21:54.341
<i>Squawk! Loser.
Squawk! Loser.</i>

21:54.424 --> 21:59.893
The images in my head...
I can't unsee them.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.808
But I guess now that everyone
can tell their own stories,

22:02.891 --> 22:04.392
they won't need me anymore.

22:04.476 --> 22:08.188
- That's okay, though.
- Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

22:08.271 --> 22:10.941
Hey, Thunk, can you help us
with our story?

22:11.025 --> 22:15.070
It's about a girl named "Notlerk,"
who grows wings and flies

22:15.154 --> 22:17.698
and has a best friend
named "Noteep."

22:17.781 --> 22:21.618
Sure.
What if she also spits sunlight?

22:23.204 --> 22:26.205
Uh, yeah, she should spit sunlight!

22:28.959 --> 22:33.047
<i>Well done, Thunk.
Well done.</i>
