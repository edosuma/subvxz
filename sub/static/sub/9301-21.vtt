WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:37.447 --> 01:39.244
And where have you two been?

01:39.457 --> 01:41.516
You were to report back upon completion.

01:41.809 --> 01:44.202
We ran into a little problem, Skeletor.

01:44.202 --> 01:47.233
You did plant the Globe
under the Royal Palace?

01:47.644 --> 01:49.675
Not exactly.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.707
He-Man caught us. He took it.

01:51.998 --> 01:53.433
The both of you are fools!

01:55.018 --> 01:58.340
Go back and find that Globe
and plant it so it will grow.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.040
And if you fail again,

02:01.065 --> 02:03.614
I will not be so understanding.

02:10.747 --> 02:13.030
So you took the Globe away from them, hm?

02:13.255 --> 02:15.972
Yes, it's safely hidden
away in Castle Grayskull.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.678
Nice work, lad.

02:17.703 --> 02:19.348
Don't tell me, tell He-Man.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.434
I am telling He-Man.

02:22.422 --> 02:23.437
Come in.

02:23.938 --> 02:25.404
Adam, your father's been looking

02:25.429 --> 02:27.353
everywhere for you. Where have you been?

02:27.563 --> 02:30.565
Eh, oh, eh,
I was just out on some Royal business.

02:30.864 --> 02:33.425
Hm, as in 'monkey business'?

02:33.736 --> 02:36.101
Well, you better report to your father.

02:36.126 --> 02:38.136
He has a little surprise for you.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.664
Adam, this is your cousin Jeremy.

02:43.228 --> 02:44.392
Wow, the last time I saw you,

02:44.417 --> 02:45.725
you were just a baby.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.011
Big deal.

02:48.264 --> 02:50.139
Jeremy will be visiting us. I want you to

02:50.164 --> 02:52.037
take charge of him while he's here, Adam.

02:52.450 --> 02:56.554
But, Father... my Royal duties...
They will have to wait.

02:57.023 --> 02:59.288
Now show Jeremy a good time.

02:59.288 --> 03:01.633
You are certainly qualified
in that department.

03:02.086 --> 03:04.590
Oh, alright.  Let's go, cousin.

03:04.590 --> 03:07.120
Don't call me "cousin".
Sorry.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.455
Jeremy, this is Man-At-Arms.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.610
Don't you have a real name?

03:16.635 --> 03:18.345
My friends call me Duncan.

03:18.621 --> 03:20.109
That's not much better.

03:22.357 --> 03:23.640
Listen you...

03:27.049 --> 03:30.339
I'm Orko. Pleased to meet ya.
- Hi!

03:31.526 --> 03:33.542
Why, If you like,
I can show you some magic...

03:36.371 --> 03:39.654
Maybe later.
Look at all this stuff.

03:39.679 --> 03:40.831
What's this?

03:42.104 --> 03:44.655
Be careful with that.
It's my new rock softener.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.881
What's it for?
Well, to convert

03:46.906 --> 03:49.052
rocky areas to soil for farming.

03:49.308 --> 03:51.780
Now, put it down.
I haven't even tested it yet.

03:52.060 --> 03:54.510
Don't worry.  I'll test it for you.

03:54.769 --> 03:56.483
Jeremy, don't!

04:04.589 --> 04:07.497
Sorry, but now it's been tested.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.386
Young man, someone oughta
teach you some manners

04:10.411 --> 04:12.303
and respect for other people's property.

04:12.934 --> 04:14.871
Uh.. why don't we wait in the hall?

04:14.871 --> 04:17.017
That's a good idea, Orko.
Go ahead, Jeremy.

04:17.043 --> 04:18.896
You've caused enough trouble in here.

04:19.295 --> 04:20.430
Hey, Jeremy.

04:20.456 --> 04:22.479
How come you were so mean to Man-At-Arms?

04:22.856 --> 04:26.188
Ah, I'm just sick of
grown ups spoiling my fun.

04:26.830 --> 04:29.737
I know how you feel,
but Adam and Man-At-Arms are OK.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.418
We like to have fun too.
Oh yeah? We'll see!

04:35.185 --> 04:37.498
Yeah, my cousin's a real charmer alright.

04:37.523 --> 04:38.569
I'm worried, Adam.

04:38.842 --> 04:41.033
That boy is going to cause big trouble.

04:41.058 --> 04:42.397
I can feel it in my bones.

04:42.545 --> 04:43.967
I'll keep a close eye on him.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.609
You're needed for other things.

04:45.984 --> 04:47.851
Like now. You're going to help me test

04:47.876 --> 04:49.646
the rock softener out on the plains.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.168
Oh, I forgot alright.
I'll have to leave

04:52.193 --> 04:54.086
Jeremy with someone else for a while.

04:54.375 --> 04:57.562
The question is:
Who's gonna be the lucky babysitter?

04:58.597 --> 05:01.796
Duh, sure, Prince Adam.
I'll look after him.

05:02.551 --> 05:04.608
Jeremy, stay with Ram-Man for a while

05:04.633 --> 05:06.960
and don't play in any of those vehicles.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.593
They're dangerous.
Yeah sure.

05:10.968 --> 05:12.973
Duh, Don't worry.

05:12.998 --> 05:14.606
I - I got a way with youngsters.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.087
Bullseye!

05:27.719 --> 05:29.845
Do it again!  Do it again!

05:30.187 --> 05:32.192
Oh come on, not again!

05:32.217 --> 05:33.947
Enough is enough!

05:34.486 --> 05:36.691
Do it again or I'll tell the
King you were mean to me.

05:37.187 --> 05:39.359
Oh, my aching head...

05:43.697 --> 05:45.681
go ahead, try to chip it.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.917
It won't chip.  It's too hard.

05:53.477 --> 05:56.153
Stand back.
Let's see how the softener works.

06:01.042 --> 06:02.320
Now try it.

06:07.295 --> 06:09.981
It's a little too soft.
I'll have to make a quick adjustment.

06:10.230 --> 06:11.857
Well, try and hurry. I have a feeling

06:11.882 --> 06:13.251
Ram-Man maybe in over his head.

06:19.484 --> 06:22.287
Jeremy!  Where are you?

06:23.443 --> 06:26.852
Jeremy!  Where are you?

06:29.019 --> 06:32.318
Prince Adam's not gonna
like my losing the boy.

06:32.944 --> 06:34.527
Jeremy!

06:34.552 --> 06:37.264
Duh... Hey Jeremy! Answer me!

06:37.943 --> 06:39.709
Alright!

06:40.596 --> 06:43.048
Now this is what I call fun!

06:46.085 --> 06:49.050
Jeremy!  Stop!

06:49.284 --> 06:51.756
Hey, that's not a toy!

06:52.069 --> 06:54.265
Duh, Jeremy, you can bring it down

06:54.290 --> 06:56.297
by pushing the last red switch.

06:57.423 --> 06:59.423
I've got a better idea.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.303
He-Man could have put that Globe, anywhere.

07:09.224 --> 07:11.761
How does Skeletor expect us to find it?

07:11.786 --> 07:14.132
I'm tired of taking orders from him!

07:14.542 --> 07:17.851
Quiet, Evil-Lyn!
Skeletor has ways of hearing.

07:18.243 --> 07:20.617
Let him! You forget, Tri-Klops.

07:20.642 --> 07:22.250
We have powers too.

07:22.697 --> 07:25.772
If we just had... What's that?

07:28.130 --> 07:31.994
I can't make it out...
Use your dista-vision, fool!

07:35.577 --> 07:37.828
It's a young boy flying a Sky-Sled.

07:37.853 --> 07:39.400
Ram-Man is with him.

07:40.268 --> 07:42.448
Let's see what they're up to.

07:45.170 --> 07:46.843
Well, I'm just about ready.

07:47.879 --> 07:50.253
Hey, that looks like one of our Sleds!

07:53.833 --> 07:57.196
Take her down!  Now!

07:57.196 --> 07:59.097
Alright!  Alright!

08:00.610 --> 08:04.335
Hey, it's stuck! Help! Help!

08:07.696 --> 08:09.798
Help! Please someone help!

08:10.085 --> 08:12.343
It's Jeremy and Ram-Man
and they're in trouble!

08:12.368 --> 08:13.119
Hurry, lad!

08:13.471 --> 08:16.350
By the power of Grayskull.

08:20.845 --> 08:24.346
I have the power!

08:32.210 --> 08:34.283
We're gonna crash!

08:44.025 --> 08:46.556
He-Man! What's he doing up here?

08:46.836 --> 08:47.705
Let's find out!

08:47.730 --> 08:49.989
Set the Basher down behind the rocks.

08:51.837 --> 08:52.892
Wow, He-Man!

08:52.917 --> 08:56.080
I never thought I'd get
to see you in person.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.820
What happened here?
Uh.. Prince Adam's cousin

08:59.845 --> 09:03.380
Jeremy, he decided to
go for a little joyride.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.686
Why, Jeremy?
I thought it'd be fun.

09:06.933 --> 09:08.492
Somebody could have been hurt.

09:08.517 --> 09:09.972
That's not my idea of fun.

09:10.358 --> 09:12.761
But you saved us. Nothing happened.

09:12.997 --> 09:15.157
One of these days something you do might

09:15.182 --> 09:17.289
cause more trouble that anyone can fix.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.729
Can you see them?

09:23.011 --> 09:24.973
My gamma-vision can.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.253
They're just behind these rocks.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.598
We were testing a new rock softener.

09:29.623 --> 09:31.613
When we're through, we'll take you back,

09:31.629 --> 09:32.733
but you'll have to spend the rest

09:32.739 --> 09:33.904
of the day in your room.

09:33.904 --> 09:36.292
But Adam said I could
go to the street market!

09:37.207 --> 09:38.802
When Adam hears what you've done

09:38.827 --> 09:40.771
I guarantee he'll agree with He-Man.

09:41.043 --> 09:42.161
Who is the boy?

09:42.186 --> 09:45.364
I don't know,
but I sense that he's weak.

09:45.364 --> 09:47.808
We may be able to use him.

09:48.684 --> 09:50.595
That should be just about right.

09:53.541 --> 09:55.731
Well, just a few more quantums...

10:05.681 --> 10:06.352
Perfect!

10:06.377 --> 10:08.389
Now let's get this soil back to my lab.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.926
If Iâ€™m right,
it should be perfect for crops.

10:11.233 --> 10:13.852
C'mon! He-Man doesn't have the Globe.

10:13.877 --> 10:15.944
Forget the Globe, three-eyes.

10:16.396 --> 10:18.928
That new invention is much more valuable.

10:18.953 --> 10:21.483
What would you want with a rock softener?

10:21.793 --> 10:24.484
We'll use it on the walls
of Castle Grayskull.

10:24.947 --> 10:27.870
You mean,
so Skeletor can get in?

10:27.895 --> 10:29.442
Not Skeletor! Us!

10:29.931 --> 10:32.963
Then we will hold all power.

10:34.524 --> 10:38.212
- Yes! Of course! Let's take it now!
- Wait!

10:38.713 --> 10:41.649
Why not?
Because we'd have to face He-Man!

10:42.006 --> 10:45.434
Then how do we get it?
We won't have to.

10:48.149 --> 10:52.044
I think that boy will get it for us.

10:58.857 --> 10:59.955
This isn't fair!

10:59.980 --> 11:03.069
You said I could go to the street market!

11:03.308 --> 11:05.533
You were told not to
play with the vehicles.

11:05.558 --> 11:07.238
I just wanted
to have some fun.

11:07.711 --> 11:09.409
What you think is fun might be

11:09.434 --> 11:11.413
dangerous to others. Or yourself.

11:11.868 --> 11:15.557
I can take care of myself.
I don't need anyone's help!

11:15.905 --> 11:17.373
Well, you did today.

11:17.398 --> 11:19.756
Duncan, let me talk to him
alone for a few minutes.

11:20.275 --> 11:21.775
Be my guest.

11:22.870 --> 11:25.025
So you don't need anyone's help, huh?

11:25.050 --> 11:25.957
That's right.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.163
I do. I need the help

11:28.188 --> 11:29.586
of people who care about me.

11:29.611 --> 11:30.658
Everybody does.

11:30.888 --> 11:33.951
I'll bet He-Man doesn't
need anybody elses help.

11:33.976 --> 11:35.038
That's not true.

11:35.511 --> 11:36.369
How do you know?

11:36.394 --> 11:38.754
I know He-Man a lot better than you think.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.291
Look, even if you could
take care of yourself,

11:41.598 --> 11:45.130
how would you feel if something
you did hurt someone else?

11:45.130 --> 11:47.872
Maybe even kill them.  Think about it.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.964
Well, going to the street market,
is not gonna hurt anybody.

12:04.683 --> 12:05.891
All right, all right!

12:05.916 --> 12:07.419
You can try the
magneto-boomerang.

12:07.419 --> 12:09.075
Just quit nagging me, will ya?

12:10.721 --> 12:12.762
There's a target on top of that building.

12:23.981 --> 12:25.776
I want to keep it!

12:25.801 --> 12:27.753
I told you.
You don't have enough money!

12:27.753 --> 12:30.632
Perhaps this would be enough.

12:31.901 --> 12:34.384
Ah, yes. Yes!
[laughs]

12:34.509 --> 12:36.587
Yeah, the Magneto-Boomerang is
yours, my friend.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.265
Oh, one moment, young man.

12:40.581 --> 12:42.610
I paid for that.

12:42.913 --> 12:44.201
You can keep it,

12:44.226 --> 12:47.122
if you help me play a little joke.

12:47.913 --> 12:48.984
On whom?

12:49.009 --> 12:52.196
An old friend of mine.
Man-at-Arms.

12:52.296 --> 12:54.734
That grouch?
Sure, I'll help you.

12:55.069 --> 12:59.723
Good! There's a little box
with flashing lights in his laboratory.

13:00.348 --> 13:02.317
Yeah! His rock softener!

13:02.527 --> 13:05.947
Bring it back here to me.
And I get to keep it? The Boomerang?

13:06.380 --> 13:08.896
Deal.  I hope it's a good joke.

13:12.350 --> 13:16.880
The joke will be on
He-Man and all of Eternia!

13:20.504 --> 13:22.927
You'll be going home tomorrow, Jeremy.

13:22.952 --> 13:26.244
Have you enjoyed your stay?
- Eh, it's been alright.

13:26.659 --> 13:28.798
Y-Your Majesty! Adam!

13:28.823 --> 13:31.152
T-The rock softener!
Someone's taken it.

13:31.462 --> 13:34.310
That device was for
the good of everybody.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.673
Who would have taken it?

13:35.880 --> 13:38.711
I can't imagine.  Unless...

13:39.815 --> 13:41.652
What's the hardest substance

13:41.677 --> 13:43.964
on the planet?
- The walls of Grayskull!

13:43.964 --> 13:47.048
I don't get it. Why is everyone so upset?

13:47.272 --> 13:49.345
Skeletor's warriors could use the rock

13:49.370 --> 13:51.230
softner to enter Castle Grayskull.

13:51.568 --> 13:54.066
If that happened, all of Eternia

13:54.091 --> 13:56.823
would fall to the forces of evil.

13:58.284 --> 14:02.128
Does that mean that...
that people would get hurt?

14:02.695 --> 14:04.406
Maybe even killed?

14:04.406 --> 14:07.445
Jeremy, do you know anything about this?
Kinda.

14:07.855 --> 14:10.609
Now this is serious.
Tell us what you know. Right now.

14:10.875 --> 14:14.384
I took the rock softener.
A woman asked me to.

14:14.824 --> 14:17.869
Woman?
You can bet it was Evil-Lyn.

14:17.869 --> 14:21.308
She said it was a joke.
She bought me a boomerang.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.655
You've made a grave mistake, young man.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.593
Man-At-Arms, alert Captain Teela at once!

14:28.075 --> 14:30.077
Eternia's only hope is that

14:30.102 --> 14:32.473
somehow, He-Man will get word.

14:35.906 --> 14:37.684
Hurry!

14:39.252 --> 14:42.138
By the power of Grayskull

14:47.283 --> 14:51.728
I have the power!

14:56.481 --> 14:58.793
I'm gonna make up for what I've done.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.536
You were right about
Jeremy causing trouble.

15:03.850 --> 15:05.883
You know, I think he actually felt bad.

15:05.908 --> 15:07.407
Maybe he's learned something.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.695
Let's just hope he hasn't
learned it too late.

15:21.313 --> 15:23.307
As soon as I get the right setting,

15:23.332 --> 15:25.300
we'll soften the walls of Grayskull

15:25.300 --> 15:27.635
and enter our new home.

15:28.174 --> 15:33.221
Attention!
Sensors detect Growth Globe nearby.

15:33.551 --> 15:38.880
So that's where He-Man hid the Globe!
Castle Grayskull ! - Activate it!

15:47.985 --> 15:51.264
It will keep growing until we stop it.

15:51.289 --> 15:54.819
Until it's knocked down the castle walls,

15:55.220 --> 15:56.877
from the inside.

15:57.094 --> 15:59.798
Now, to weaken those walls.

16:01.549 --> 16:05.205
I sense danger.
An enemy attacking the castle!

16:12.335 --> 16:14.286
There's Evil-Lyn!

16:18.223 --> 16:20.658
The Jawbridge! It's starting to crack!

16:23.232 --> 16:25.476
It's too powerful for my magic!

16:27.336 --> 16:29.184
The party's over, Evil-Lyn!

16:31.867 --> 16:34.757
He-Man! Quick! Inside!

16:40.838 --> 16:42.901
He-Man!  Hang on!

16:50.776 --> 16:52.707
Look! The Jawbridge is open!

16:52.732 --> 16:55.062
Grayskull is ours for the taking!

16:55.307 --> 16:58.400
And He-Man won't be
giving us any trouble now.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.838
He-Man!  You're hurt!

17:03.922 --> 17:06.164
Jeremy!  Bring me my machine!

17:07.353 --> 17:09.213
Stop the boy!

17:10.998 --> 17:14.515
Use your boomerang to get the machine. Now!

17:18.810 --> 17:20.276
Hey!

17:24.349 --> 17:27.445
Now if I can just reverse it's effect...

17:30.413 --> 17:33.011
That's better.  Now for you, Evil-Lyn.

17:36.070 --> 17:38.681
No more Mister Soft Guy!

17:38.976 --> 17:41.513
Hey, put me down, now!

17:41.638 --> 17:44.230
No! Put us down!

17:44.430 --> 17:46.445
Duncan! Your Porta-Prison!

17:46.470 --> 17:47.864
With pleasure!

17:52.665 --> 17:55.343
He-Man! Quick! Inside!

17:55.604 --> 17:57.852
Castle Grayskull is in danger!

18:07.297 --> 18:09.102
No magic can stop it!

18:09.127 --> 18:11.275
Only your strength can!

18:17.075 --> 18:20.714
Push, He-Man!
Use all your power!

18:27.046 --> 18:28.700
It's skrinking!

18:37.799 --> 18:41.576
Sorceress!
Can you get me to the window?

18:50.436 --> 18:52.264
Thanks for the lift!

19:04.284 --> 19:07.327
I guess, thats the way the ball bounces.

19:12.745 --> 19:14.756
Before I left, I wanted you all to

19:14.781 --> 19:16.848
know how sorry I am for what I did.

19:17.418 --> 19:19.443
Well, we all make mistakes, Jeremy.

19:19.468 --> 19:21.686
At least you were willing to
learn something from yours.

19:21.698 --> 19:24.782
Not only that, but you're quite
a shot with that boomerang.

19:25.140 --> 19:27.250
Thank you, but it was your idea.

19:27.275 --> 19:28.989
I'm glad you were there.

19:29.186 --> 19:31.578
And He-Man was glad you
and Duncan were there

19:31.603 --> 19:33.994
to help him.
- You think so? Did he tell you?

19:34.436 --> 19:37.467
Well, let's just say, I'm pretty sure.

19:39.041 --> 19:42.895
Well, bye everybody!
I'll never forget my trip and

19:42.920 --> 19:46.772
I'll never forget to listen to
the people who care about me.

19:50.891 --> 19:53.721
Hey Jeremy!
You forgot your boomerang!

19:55.046 --> 19:57.922
Here!
Orko, don't throw it!

19:59.404 --> 20:02.177
Whoops! Sorry!
But why didn't you want me to throw it?

20:08.455 --> 20:11.922
That's why!
Hmm.. I can see what you mean.

20:14.187 --> 20:18.600
Hey! Keep away! Hey, no!
Get away! Get back! Help!

20:30.176 --> 20:33.116
Well Orko, Jeremy sure changed his ways.

20:33.339 --> 20:35.971
Yeah. He was acting
pretty rotten for a while.

20:35.996 --> 20:38.436
I think all he really wanted was
for people to notice him.

20:38.770 --> 20:42.035
But what good does it do to be noticed
if people don't like what they see?

20:42.035 --> 20:45.896
That's right. The best way to get
attention is not to look for it.

20:45.896 --> 20:51.083
By being polite and helpful, people will
not only notice you, they'll like you, too.

20:51.553 --> 20:53.547
I'm going to do something
helpful right now.

20:53.572 --> 20:54.235
What's that?

20:54.490 --> 20:56.449
I'm going to say goodbye!

20:57.305 --> 21:03.566
