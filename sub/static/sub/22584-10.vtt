WEBVTT

00:05.120 --> 00:07.509
I admit it. I've got a few butterflies.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.311
Okay, more than a few.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.476
You haven't stopped talking about this
for a week.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.114
It's different for you.
You grew up with the man.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.310
When I was seven,
my mom bought me a book about him.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.351
Emory Erickson:
Father of the Transporter.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.357
I made her read it to me
every night for a month.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.550
That book is the reason
I became an engineer.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.672
Did I ever tell you about
meeting Zefram Cochrane?

00:26.800 --> 00:28.677
Yeah, only about 50 times.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.597
Then you know
I understand how you feel.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.714
You want a mirror?

00:41.520 --> 00:44.080
You've got a mean streak in you,
you know that?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

00:55.120 --> 00:56.838
Nothing seems to be missing.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.999
-Hello, Emory.
-Jonathan, look at you.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.108
I always suspected you'd be famous.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.598
Just didn't think
that you'd be more famous than me!

01:12.960 --> 01:14.439
-Jon.
-Good to see you.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.231
Oh, we have a lot of catching up to do.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.828
Do it later. I want a tour of this place.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.555
My Chief Engineer,
Commander Charles Tucker.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.669
It's an honour.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.870
Guess you and l
will be spending some time together.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.719
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Danica. Trip.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.197
I hope you don't mind
that I'm borrowing your ship, Captain.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.112
As long as you return it
in good condition.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.231
Don't know if I can promise that.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.592
When this test is over, Enterprise
and all of Starfleet could be obsolete.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.919
Sounds like
you're trying to put me out of a job.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.314
It's been a long road

01:53.160 --> 01:55.628
Gettin' from there to here

01:56.200 --> 01:59.397
It's been a long time

01:59.840 --> 02:03.196
But my time is finally near

02:03.760 --> 02:06.877
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:07.880 --> 02:10.314
I will touch the sky

02:10.960 --> 02:14.350
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:14.800 --> 02:17.439
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:17.760 --> 02:22.038
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:22.320 --> 02:25.232
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:25.360 --> 02:29.353
I've got faith to believe

02:29.760 --> 02:32.593
I can do anything

02:32.720 --> 02:36.508
I've got strength of the soul

02:37.080 --> 02:39.958
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:40.080 --> 02:43.868
I can reach any star

02:45.480 --> 02:47.675
I've got faith

02:49.160 --> 02:51.754
I've got faith

02:52.840 --> 02:56.196
Faith of the heart

03:07.120 --> 03:08.917
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.429
In preparation
for Doctor Erickson's experiment...

03:11.560 --> 03:14.711
we've reduced power
in all but essential areas of the ship.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.313
Feel like some company?

03:23.160 --> 03:26.277
We haven't talked much since Vulcan.
How are you holding up?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.674
I'm fine.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.270
I've been seeing you by yourself a lot.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.708
-I'm reading the Kir'Shara.
-How is it?

03:35.560 --> 03:38.199
-lnteresting.
-lnteresting?

03:39.160 --> 03:40.434
Extremely.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.234
Look, I know what you're going through.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.155
Losing a family member,
it's the toughest thing there is.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.953
I see no point in discussing it.
It's in the past.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.720
-Your mother died a week ago.
-Talking won't change that.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.628
-lt may change the way you feel about it.
-I don't feel anything about it.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.275
-Well, you can tell yourself that.
-It's the truth.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.474
You know, when Lizzie died...

04:02.600 --> 04:05.512
there were times I wanted to just close
up and retreat inside of myself.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.110
Trip, I appreciate what you're trying
to do, but it's not necessary.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.429
You're fine?

04:14.400 --> 04:15.389
Well...

04:15.880 --> 04:19.077
if you ever do want to talk, let me know.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.309
I'll see you.

04:33.800 --> 04:38.316
Sub-quantum teleportation.
You step onto a transporter on Earth...

04:38.680 --> 04:41.194
a few seconds later, you're on Vulcan.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.159
-That's over 16 light-years.
-That's just for starters.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.158
Theoretically, there is no limit
to the distance.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.796
One of the things we're here to test.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.718
You tell me, with that kind
of technology...

04:52.840 --> 04:54.796
who'd have any use for a starship?

04:55.720 --> 04:58.837
-Maybe you will put me out of a job.
-Dad.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.237
I wouldn't worry too much.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.074
It's going to take decades
to work out all the bugs.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.557
But when we do, Starfleet's going
to look a hell of a lot different.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.512
That's if it exists at all.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.037
You can see he hasn't changed.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.312
I remember you and my father
having similar discussions.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.829
He believed the future
was in the warp drive.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.112
I believed in the transporter pad.
I miss those talks.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.759
I miss him.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.309
To Henry.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.079
The Vulcan Science Academy...

05:38.200 --> 05:41.192
has been studying sub-quantum
transporting for some time.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.958
With little result.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.152
I've been trying to get my hands on
some of that research for years.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.238
In hindsight,
it's probably just as well that I couldn't.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.078
Might have sent me
down the wrong path.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.237
It's hard to imagine.
Beaming someone that far.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.352
All breakthroughs are hard to imagine
before they happen.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.160
When I developed the transporter,
most people simply couldn't grasp it.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.879
When I developed the transporter,
most people simply couldn't grasp it.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.828
Some still can't.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.396
I have to confess, given a choice...

06:07.000 --> 06:09.912
I'd much rather use
a good old-fashioned shuttlepod.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.033
I'll never forget the protests...

06:13.160 --> 06:15.754
when the transporter
was first approved for bio-matter.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.111
-Oh, God, here we go.
-People said it was unsafe.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.352
That it caused brain cancer, psychosis.
And even sleep disorders.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.189
And then there was
all that metaphysical chatter about...

06:27.320 --> 06:29.709
whether or not the person
who arrived after the transport...

06:29.840 --> 06:31.876
was the same person who left.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.596
And not some weird copy.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.350
Which would make all of us copies.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.115
I had to fight all of that nonsense.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.908
And I'm not gonna tell you
there weren't costs.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.630
I'm living proof of that, but I won.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.998
Mankind is better off.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.509
Makes everything
I fought for worthwhile.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.831
Here's to a successful experiment.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.591
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.075
We're entering an area
known as the Barrens.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.589
There's not a star system
within 100 light-years.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.029
Perfect conditions for Emory's test.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.628
Those early days were pretty terrifying.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.678
I'm lucky to be alive.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.110
Is it true
you were the first person to go through?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.435
I wasn't about to let anyone else do it.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.909
-You must have been scared.
-Terrified.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.599
That original transporter took
a full minute and a half to cycle through.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.599
Felt like a year.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.438
You could actually feel yourself
being taken apart and put back together.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.711
When I materialized,
first thing I did was lose my lunch.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.590
Second thing I did was get stone drunk.
Trick I learned from Zefram Cochrane.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.079
Now there was a man who knew
the benefits of a little "liquid courage."

07:59.320 --> 08:00.594
What is it?

08:00.960 --> 08:03.997
Well, you're gonna need more juice
than I thought.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.949
Not more than Enterprise can spare.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.429
Well...

08:08.640 --> 08:10.835
we'll have to draw directly
from the warp reactor.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.269
May even have
to shut down a few systems.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.233
-You'll be able to leave the lights on.
-Yeah.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.396
If I could get a look at your
power converter, it might help me out.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.229
I'll tell you what. When I'm done
with this, I'll install the converter.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.592
See if I can't make life easier on you.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.395
Well, thanks, but when it comes to
modifying our systems...

08:31.520 --> 08:33.828
I prefer to do things myself.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.277
-Can I get a look at it?
-I said I'd install the converter.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.519
And I said "no, thanks."

08:44.120 --> 08:47.749
I wish I had time to debate the finer
points of engineering protocol...

08:47.880 --> 08:49.996
but as you can see I'm extremely busy.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.750
And I realize this is your ship
and I'm only a guest.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.793
But let me remind you
that Starfleet has granted me...

08:56.920 --> 08:59.275
complete access to your systems.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.796
If you hadn't noticed,
I'm more than capable...

09:01.920 --> 09:03.876
of handling a little power upgrade.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.873
Hand me that, will you?

09:20.920 --> 09:23.388
That's the main reactor and those
are the plasma feeds, right?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.078
You know the ship
like a member of the crew.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.111
I've read just about everything
I could find on her.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.111
I probably could describe
every one of your missions.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.830
-Still wonder why you haven't signed on.
-I think you know the answer.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.076
Your father
seems like he can take care of himself.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.272
-He sure hasn't lost any of his edge.
-Can't argue with that.

09:39.400 --> 09:43.109
-So, why are you still on Earth?
-He needs me.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.836
He still hasn't gotten over Quinn.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.475
-It's been 14 years.
-15.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.668
He lost a son.
If you leave, he'll lose a daughter.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.350
If this test goes well,
it'll be a new start for him.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.516
Give him something to look forward to.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.518
He won't spend all of his time
thinking about the past.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.237
And if the test doesn't go well?

10:05.680 --> 10:06.908
I don't know.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.632
We both grew up with fathers
who could be pretty demanding.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.432
That's an understatement.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.798
Maybe you should start thinking
more about yourself.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.558
I know, it's hard taking advice...

10:23.680 --> 10:26.114
from someone who used to
chase you around the backyard...

10:26.240 --> 10:27.912
with a plastic laser pistol.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.314
Yeah, but it's good advice, Jonathan.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.111
I just wish I could follow it.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.397
-How was your tour?
-I enjoyed it.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.189
I can always tell when you're upset.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.116
You do this like you're in a hurry.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.159
Don't you think there's something
to be upset about?

11:14.880 --> 11:18.793
We're here.
That's reason enough to be optimistic.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.910
-We're lying to them.
-We have no choice.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.031
We could talk to Jon.
He might be able to help us.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.709
No. He wouldn't understand.
We can't say anything to him.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.998
-We can't trust anyone.
-It's Jon.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.474
He's a Starfleet captain.
His first duty is to his ship.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.718
You talk about him like he's an enemy.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.673
He's not an enemy.

11:45.960 --> 11:49.077
But he's not on our side, either.
Believe me.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.872
-It's from over there.
-No.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.312
I'll take up. You take down.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.956
-lt could be a form of spatial distortion.
-Can you pinpoint it?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.871
F-Deck. Near the Armoury.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.110
Sickbay! Crewman down
in the Armoury!

13:42.880 --> 13:45.394
He suffered massive cellular disruption.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.990
As if he'd been subjected to intense...

13:49.480 --> 13:50.913
delta radiation.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.031
Did other crewmen see anything?

13:53.160 --> 13:54.354
The lights were malfunctioning.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.471
This anomaly you detected...

13:57.120 --> 13:59.315
you think it was somehow responsible?

13:59.480 --> 14:02.597
It showed up at the same time.
In the same location.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.517
-Can't have been a coincidence.
-I sympathize, believe me.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.719
During the initial tests
for the transporter...

14:10.840 --> 14:12.990
some brave men and women were lost.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.079
Not a day goes by
that I don't think about them.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.074
How can I help?

14:18.200 --> 14:21.078
You've spent a great deal of time
in this region of space.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.869
-I never encountered anything like this.
-Are you sure?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.798
There's a reason
this is called the Barrens, Captain.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.278
There's nothing out here.

14:30.680 --> 14:34.036
Something out here
killed one of my crewmen.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.750
I wish I had an explanation for you.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.553
-What is it?
-Time for my treatment.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.229
Dani.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.309
I'm sorry.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.314
Can we continue this later?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.435
Of course.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.189
Calm down.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.153
You never said anything like this
would happen!

15:00.280 --> 15:02.748
-I didn't know this would happen.
-Dad...

15:03.680 --> 15:07.309
a man is dead. And we're responsible.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.272
I'm not going to go along
with this anymore.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.389
Listen to me.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.670
No. No.
We've got to tell them the truth.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.232
Dani, you're condemning him to death!

15:19.000 --> 15:20.399
I'm condemning him?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.757
How do you know he isn't already dead?

15:26.880 --> 15:27.949
He's alive.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.035
Dad...

15:32.960 --> 15:34.791
Jonathan's practically family.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.637
He and Quinn were best friends.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.075
I know. I know that.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.633
We can't do this to him, to his crew.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.715
We're almost ready for our first test.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.516
Someone else could die before then.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.191
The odds of that happening again
are extremely small.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.799
No one's going to die.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.391
I just need a couple days.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.156
We owe him that much, Dani.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.193
I wonder what he would have to say
about all this.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.633
About what we're doing.

16:11.320 --> 16:14.118
When we're done, you can ask him.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.038
Routing power.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.911
-Ready.
-Help me up.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.551
-Sir?
-Give me a hand, please.

16:36.840 --> 16:37.880
This part I like doing myself.

16:37.880 --> 16:38.756
This part I like doing myself.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.193
Energizing.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.639
The probe materialized
at the target coordinates.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.952
Looks like it arrived in good condition.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.435
Captain, we're receiving telemetry.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.237
We're already getting back data.
Congratulations, Emory.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.952
40,000 kilometres.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.874
-Nothing's ever gone that far.
-It's a start.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.790
It's gonna take a few hours
to gather all the telemetry.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.109
Let's celebrate in Mess Hall. My treat.

17:21.240 --> 17:25.518
I like to monitor the data as it comes in.
I'm sort of obsessive that way.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.991
Then let me bring
something back for you.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.190
Help pass the time
between data-streams.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.355
No, thanks.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.351
It's been a long day.
You must be starving.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.471
You go ahead. I'll join you later.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.716
Sure you don't want
a second pair of eyes?

17:39.840 --> 17:41.592
One pair will do.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.711
And no offence, Commander...

17:43.840 --> 17:46.274
but I work much better
when I'm not being distracted.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.878
You know where to find me.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.434
Come in.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.559
Something's wrong.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.798
Most of the work Emory had me do...

18:09.920 --> 18:13.515
tapping into the warp reactor for extra
power, re-routing the plasma flow.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.111
It wasn't necessary for the test.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.959
What are you saying?

18:19.280 --> 18:21.510
-Remember when the lights dimmed?
-Yeah.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.438
Well, he channelled that energy
into a feedback loop.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.837
It wasn't going into the beam.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.638
Maybe he needs the power
for another phase of the experiment.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.432
Well, from what I can tell...

18:32.560 --> 18:36.155
his sub-quantum version should use
less energy than a regular transporter.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.635
That's one of the reasons
it's so brilliant.

18:38.760 --> 18:42.389
Either he was keeping me busy, making
sure I was looking the other way...

18:42.760 --> 18:45.320
or this sub-quantum thing is a
smokescreen for something else.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.953
Something he hasn't told us about.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.638
I wouldn't have picked up on any of it...

18:48.760 --> 18:51.149
if you hadn't asked me
to take a closer look.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.919
When I asked Emory about the anomaly
that killed Burrows...

18:54.040 --> 18:56.679
he claimed he'd never
heard of anything like it.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.548
Not true?

18:58.680 --> 19:02.912
Something very similar appeared on
Emory's research ship. Five years ago.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.517
T'Pol dug up the report
from Starfleet's data banks.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.914
Crew member saw it.
Said it seemed to be alive.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.432
Bridge to Captain Archer.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.314
-Go ahead.
-We're picking up another one.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.556
It's on C-Deck. Section Five.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.749
On my way.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.949
-It's fluctuating.
-What's your best guess?

19:36.600 --> 19:37.874
I've lost it.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.076
T ake Section Three. Take Section Four.
Don't let it touch you.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.149
This way.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.639
It should be here.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.718
It's highly unstable,
surrounded by a subspace field.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.398
You're fortunate
you didn't have more prolonged contact.

20:19.320 --> 20:22.596
-Can you put that down for 30 seconds?
-I took visual readings.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.999
Can you slow it down?

20:35.880 --> 20:36.869
Hold it.

20:39.640 --> 20:40.675
Enhance.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.589
A little more.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.157
-Who is it?
-It's Quinn.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.074
Emory's son.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.993
That's incredible. He hasn't aged a day.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.429
Emory?

21:12.480 --> 21:15.040
I'm not here to test a new transporter.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.877
I'm here to bring back my son.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.472
What are you talking about?

21:25.680 --> 21:27.830
We were conducting first trials.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.796
My greatest achievement.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.109
Quinn wanted to be
the first to go through.

21:34.680 --> 21:38.036
He was a lot like his old man.
A lot like you.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.395
I lost his signal and couldn't get it back.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.877
Truth is, the sub-quantum transporter...

21:46.000 --> 21:47.956
is a fundamentally flawed concept.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.955
It'll never work.
Not now, not 1000 years from now.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.109
I suppose I knew that at the time.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.436
You let him go through with the test?

21:58.640 --> 22:01.279
I was a relatively young man who had...

22:02.720 --> 22:05.234
created something to change Starfleet.

22:05.440 --> 22:09.194
After an achievement of that magnitude,
there was nowhere to go but down.

22:10.440 --> 22:14.433
My life became just one long struggle
to recapture past glory.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.233
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about Quinn.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.830
I wasn't thinking of the consequences.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.869
You said you came here
to get him back?

22:31.280 --> 22:33.271
This region, the Barrens...

22:33.640 --> 22:36.200
is actually a subspace node.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.838
A bubble of curved space-time.
It's why there are no stars.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.594
Quinn's transporter signal
is trapped here.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.233
At certain intervals,
there are fluctuations in the node...

22:47.360 --> 22:48.918
that cause the signal to reappear.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.830
If we can lock onto it at one of
those intervals, we can save him.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.716
You could have told me
all of this before.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.434
Starfleet would never have authorized
the mission.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.429
-I had to create an excuse.
-A member of my crew is dead.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.552
I didn't know that the manifestations
would be dangerous, believe me.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.513
-You want me to believe you?
-I want you to help me.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.273
-Quinn was like a brother to you.
-You were like my second father.

23:15.680 --> 23:19.753
-You should have trusted me.
-All I need is one more scan.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.751
-I can bring him back.
-ls that the truth?

23:22.880 --> 23:23.869
I'm not lying.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.513
You've been lying to me
since you came aboard.

23:25.640 --> 23:29.189
I had no choice! I'm sorry.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.518
Please help me, Jonathan.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.679
Help me save my son.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.715
Please.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.915
I want you both to work with Emory,
give him whatever help he needs.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.318
-What is it, Trip?
-I can't believe I'm hearing this.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.920
-We've already lost one man.
-lt won't happen again.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.194
-We've already lost one man.
-lt won't happen again.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.878
We'll alert the crew to the danger.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.072
If they'd been alerted 24 hours ago,
Burrows might be alive.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.114
We don't fully understand
the nature of these manifestations.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.959
-They could pose other dangers.
-I know there's a risk.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.117
We're talking one more day.
That's all Emory needs.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.515
-What he claims he needs.
-I believe him.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.633
-Because he's a friend of the family?
-That's not why I'm doing this.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.639
-Why are you doing this?
-Quinn's signal is getting weaker, Trip.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.398
It's been decaying for the past 15 years.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.078
Emory says if we don't do
something now...

24:23.200 --> 24:24.599
we'll never get him back in one piece.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.119
We have a responsibility to help.

24:26.240 --> 24:29.277
What about Emory's responsibility?
He lied to get us out here.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.674
I'm aware of that.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.034
But we're here.

24:34.320 --> 24:37.392
We can't just turn the ship around
and leave a man to die.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.120
You have your orders.
I suggest you get started.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.829
We're still getting a spike in the array.

24:57.560 --> 25:01.030
I could swap out the emitter coils
with something from Engineering.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.236
-Might even out a bit.
-Sounds good.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.068
I'll get on it.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.509
I know you don't approve
of what I've done.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.834
You need my approval?

25:12.960 --> 25:15.315
I'm disappointed
that you think less of me.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.953
You liked me better
when I worshipped your shadow?

25:20.480 --> 25:21.469
Yes.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.553
It's an honest answer.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.996
I'd think you'd be out of practice.

25:28.280 --> 25:32.637
You may want to reserve judgment
on my actions until you've lost a son.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.278
I have lost someone close.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.715
And I'd do almost anything
to get her back.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.151
Except put other people in danger.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.955
Quinn and I used to argue all the time.

25:52.920 --> 25:55.718
Wasn't until I lost him
that I realized that those arguments...

25:56.280 --> 25:59.158
were some of the happiest moments
of my life.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.273
I'll be in Engineering.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.069
Can I come in?

26:20.160 --> 26:24.073
Hey, there. You must be Porthos.
Heard a lot about you.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.557
-He's got a lot of personality.
-And an appetite to match.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.837
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.997
I should have come to you earlier.
I feel responsible.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.833
-You lost a crewman.
-We can't change what's happened.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.036
Maybe some good can come out of it.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.957
-You think we can get him back?
-I think that it's possible.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.676
That's enough reason for me to try.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.515
I wonder...

26:57.680 --> 26:59.910
what it must be like for him, you know.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.876
Is he in pain? Is he conscious?

27:08.960 --> 27:11.872
If he is, does he think
that we've forgotten about him?

27:15.520 --> 27:17.511
Quinn was everything to my father.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.554
To both of us.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.596
Getting him back is all that we've
thought about for the past 15 years.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.597
Let's hope when this is over...

27:29.520 --> 27:31.875
you'll have something else
to think about.

27:37.160 --> 27:38.957
The power conversion tables.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.638
Some of these modifications
should help.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.749
Thanks.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.276
-ls there anything else?
-No, I think we're pretty much there.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.793
I'm trying to decide
what to show for "movie night."

27:50.920 --> 27:52.273
"Movie night?"

27:52.640 --> 27:55.200
Yeah, I thought I'd fire up
the old tradition.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.789
You in the mood for a horror film
or a musical?

27:57.920 --> 28:00.309
I don't think I'll have the time for either.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.515
You can't spend every second of your
life studying that whatever it's called.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.200
-Kir'Shara.
-You got to take a break eventually.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.468
Eventually.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.753
I don't get you, T'Pol.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.596
I thought you joined Starfleet so you
could interact a little more with humans.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.915
But it seems to me that
ever since we left spacedock...

28:18.040 --> 28:20.076
you spend all your free time
cooped up in your room...

28:20.200 --> 28:22.191
reading that bible of yours.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.631
I may have found new priorities.

28:24.800 --> 28:28.156
-What's that supposed to mean?
-I'm needed on the Bridge.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.278
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.635
Archer.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.752
I picked up something that was
in your area. But I've lost it.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.154
Keep monitoring.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.399
He's here.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.358
Jonathan. There.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.994
Quinn?

29:13.160 --> 29:14.275
Quinn?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.797
It knocked out an EPS junction.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.114
Repair is going to take
a couple of hours.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.196
Will it affect the transporter?

29:43.320 --> 29:44.309
No.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.757
I can't believe
you're still going through with it.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.393
We're not going to have
this argument again.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.272
That thing barely missed
a stack of torpedoes.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.437
If it had jumped two feet to the left,
we wouldn't be here to talk about it.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.154
We should concentrate on repairing
the ship so we can get out of here.

29:56.280 --> 29:59.431
If we beam Quinn aboard, there won't
be any more of these manifestations.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.788
-How the hell do you know?
-Trip!

30:00.920 --> 30:03.388
You're putting your personal feelings
before the safety of the ship!

30:03.520 --> 30:05.636
-You are this close to insubordination!
-lnsubordination?

30:05.760 --> 30:08.991
I've made a decision. It's the right
decision. And the discussion is over.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.473
Can you accept that?

30:12.120 --> 30:14.714
-Now go do your job!
-Yes, sir.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.478
I got what I needed.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.958
You should be able to get a good lock
when he reappears.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.277
-When will that be?
-Just over three hours.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.076
-How's your ship?
-We're ready.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.753
-You saved my life.
-Forget it.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.755
You didn't deserve
any of this, Jonathan.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.109
I'm sorry this became your problem.

30:50.240 --> 30:54.119
Let's make it worthwhile,
let's get Quinn back.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.909
-I'm scared.
-I don't blame you.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.956
I've waited so long for this moment.
Planned for it.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.789
What if something goes wrong?
What if I fail?

31:11.040 --> 31:13.600
On the day before
I entered flight training...

31:13.840 --> 31:16.274
I asked my father
pretty much the same thing.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.520
What did he say?

31:19.520 --> 31:19.679
What did he say?

31:21.720 --> 31:22.835
"Don't fail."

31:25.880 --> 31:27.677
Henry never was a poet.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.273
He didn't need to be.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.633
Any moment now.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.035
-T'Pol?
-Nothing.

32:04.680 --> 32:05.795
-Captain.
-Go ahead.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.672
B-Deck, Section Eight.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.354
Confinement beam.
Widest possible spread.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.754
Way ahead of you.

32:14.440 --> 32:17.637
Got a lock on something.
Pattern's good.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.395
Let me.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.193
Energizing.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.392
-We need more power.
-That's all we've got.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.509
It's working.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.434
Quinn!

32:49.200 --> 32:51.270
No. No!

32:56.880 --> 32:58.711
Complete the transport sequence.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.273
I don't have a strong enough signal.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.516
Recalibrate the confinement beam.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.029
-That won't help get us a lock.
-Just do it.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.718
I'm reading
massive cellular deterioration.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.034
That's not possible.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.436
He's losing cohesion.
If he materializes, he'll die in seconds.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.114
I can reverse the damage
by cross-phasing the stream.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.277
-The transporter can't do that.
-I built the damn thing!

33:20.400 --> 33:22.072
I'm losing his vital signs.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.277
-Emory.
-Get away from me.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.872
Tie in the secondary buffers.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.149
There's not enough time.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.874
-Dad.
-I can hold the pattern. Just do it!

33:37.000 --> 33:38.956
-Dad, let him go.
-No!

33:39.080 --> 33:40.559
There's nothing you can do for him.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.148
I can't let him go, I can't!

33:48.320 --> 33:51.392
Emory, you can't save him.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.394
I'm sorry, Quinn.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.029
Oh, Quinn.

34:26.159 --> 34:28.754
Dad? What's wrong?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.476
Quinn, please forgive me, please.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.239
What is it? What?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.194
Come in.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.677
I couldn't leave him like that.

35:25.400 --> 35:29.552
It's better to be alive or dead.
Not somewhere in between.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.833
If it means anything...

35:35.080 --> 35:37.435
my guess is Quinn would
feel the same way.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.835
I came here to bring my son home.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.549
I suppose I accomplished my goal.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.671
I've been in contact with Starfleet.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.234
I imagine they're not too happy
with all this.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.828
I'm sure they'll take
your achievements into consideration.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.555
I perpetrated a fraud
to obtain the use of your ship.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.150
A member of your crew is dead.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.877
There's no way I'm going to avoid
the consequences.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.195
There's one good thing
to come out of this.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.992
Dani won't have to worry about
taking care of me anymore.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.669
I managed to let go of
one of my children.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.913
Now, I guess it's time for me
to let go of the other.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.830
I always thought she should be out here.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.320
Maybe they'll put me somewhere
where I'll be useful.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.873
Get a chance to teach.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.597
You'd probably be good at it.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.039
I wouldn't be boring.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.557
Why settle for making
myself miserable...

36:40.680 --> 36:44.798
when I can spread the misery around
to an entire class of students?

36:47.440 --> 36:51.115
Your neurolytic enzymes are at
the same level they were a week ago.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.077
No sign of Pa'nar Syndrome.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.030
It's still difficult for me to accept.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.238
You were diagnosed with
an incurable disease, now it's gone.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.839
It's a big adjustment.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.589
From what I've been reading...

37:04.720 --> 37:06.950
similar diagnoses have taken place
all over Vulcan.

37:07.080 --> 37:10.675
People with Pa'nar are coming forward.
It's no longer a stigma.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.994
The Kir'Shara is having
an enormous impact.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.351
It's clearly had an impact on you.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.759
You seem more certain of yourself.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.112
I've never felt less certain.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.638
You're re-examining your core beliefs.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.797
Something most people never do.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.628
-Do you have a moment?
-Sure.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.437
Something tells me you're not here
to talk about movie night.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.596
I'm going through something
that's very complicated.

38:04.880 --> 38:05.835
I know.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.229
I'm learning, it seems for the first time...

38:12.000 --> 38:13.991
what it truly means to be Vulcan.

38:15.520 --> 38:19.195
-Well, maybe you can fill me in.
-Not until I understand it myself.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.350
I don't think there'll be time for....

38:29.120 --> 38:30.792
What do you want me to say?

38:31.480 --> 38:32.879
That you understand.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.275
I do.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.789
It's not like I didn't know
this was coming.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.795
At least my warp engines still need me.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.352
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.391
We've rendezvoused
with the Sarajevo...

39:01.520 --> 39:04.239
which will be returning
Emory and Danica to Earth.

39:05.840 --> 39:06.989
Safe journey.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.832
And you, Jonathan.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.869
Commander.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.358
An honour working with you.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.553
Some suggestions.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.232
Might boost your transporter range
a few hundred kilometres.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.514
Couldn't resist.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.599
I'll check it out.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.518
Say goodbye to Porthos.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.713
-Good luck.
-Maybe I'll see you around.
