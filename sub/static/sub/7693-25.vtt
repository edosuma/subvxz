WEBVTT

00:06.237 --> 00:09.140
OHH. I AM SO GLAD
THAT SCHOOL'S OVER.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.682
MRS. THISTLE
TALKED FOR AN HOUR
IN HISTORY.

00:11.682 --> 00:15.186
SHE'S NINETY--
SHOULD SHE REALLY BE
WASTING THAT BREATH?

00:17.688 --> 00:20.621
( screening wands beeping )
 WHAT'S ALL THIS?

00:20.621 --> 00:22.723
LISTEN UP, FROG SPAWN!
SECURITY CHECK.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.226
PUT ALL METAL OBJECTS
IN THE BUCKET,

00:25.226 --> 00:29.700
THEN PROCEED TO THE WANDS
FOR A MORE THOROUGH SEARCH.

00:29.700 --> 00:33.064
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:33.064 --> 00:36.337
SOMEONE'S BEEN STEALING LAPTOPS
FROM THE COMPUTER LAB,

00:36.337 --> 00:38.609
SO I'M GONNA BUST THE PERP.

00:38.609 --> 00:40.541
OR PERPS.

00:42.273 --> 00:45.116
BOTTOM LINE,
NO ONE LEAVES THIS SCHOOL

00:45.116 --> 00:47.218
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH
THOSE METAL DETECTORS.

00:47.218 --> 00:50.121
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA SORT THROUGH
YOUR LOOSE CHANGE

00:50.121 --> 00:53.684
AND HAVE A LITTLE
HEART-TO-HEART WITH
THE VENDING MACHINE.

00:53.684 --> 00:57.288
GUYS, WE CANNOT
GET WANDED.

00:57.288 --> 01:00.231
THOSE THINGS WILL GO OFF
LIKE CRAZY WHEN THEY DETECT
OUR BIONICS.

01:00.231 --> 01:02.693
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
SHE'S TOTALLY GONNA BUST US.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.296
BUSTED YA FOR WHAT?

01:05.296 --> 01:07.398
WHAT ARE YOU HIDIN',
LITTLE BO PEEP?

01:08.599 --> 01:09.640
UM--HEH--

01:09.640 --> 01:11.502
HE'S NOT HIDING
ANYTHING.

01:11.502 --> 01:14.775
WELL, HE DOES HAVE
AN UNUSUALLY LARGE
BIRTH MARK ON HIS LEFT HIP.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.508
YOU STARE AT IT LONG ENOUGH
AND IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE
JUSTIN BIEBER.

01:19.810 --> 01:21.081
LET'S GO.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.613
I...

01:22.613 --> 01:24.815
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS.
 PRINCIPAL PERRY, I--

01:24.815 --> 01:27.288
COMPLY, PERP!

01:27.288 --> 01:28.619
WAND HIM.

01:29.660 --> 01:32.593
( beeps oscillate )

01:32.593 --> 01:34.725
( high-pitched beeping )

01:34.725 --> 01:36.667
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
WE GOT ONE.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.700
FLANK HIM, GIRLS.
THE LITTLE ONES ALWAYS
PUT UP A FIGHT!

01:43.304 --> 01:46.537
THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS--

01:46.537 --> 01:48.239
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US...

01:48.239 --> 01:50.541
FASTER, SMARTER.

01:50.541 --> 01:53.113
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

01:53.113 --> 01:55.316
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

01:55.316 --> 01:58.289
♪♪

02:33.384 --> 02:36.727
EVERYONE ELSE
CLEARED THE CHECKPOINT
HOURS AGO...

02:36.727 --> 02:40.431
SO WHY DO YOU THREE FLESHBAGS
KEEP SETTIN' IT OFF?!

02:40.431 --> 02:42.693
YOU MAY NOT HAVE
THE LAPTOPS,

02:42.693 --> 02:44.835
BUT YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

02:44.835 --> 02:48.199
MAYBE ANOTHER PAT-DOWN
FROM CAROL AND DEB

02:48.199 --> 02:49.540
WILL MAKE YA TALK.

02:51.442 --> 02:52.943
NO, NO. WE'RE GOOD.

02:52.943 --> 02:54.945
THE FIRST ONE ALREADY
SCARRED ME FOR LIFE.

02:54.945 --> 02:56.707
DON'T MOVE!

02:56.707 --> 03:00.481
NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE TILL
I GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.413
GUYS, WE HAVE GOT
 TO GET OUT OF HERE.

03:02.413 --> 03:04.215
RELAX. WE JUST HAVE
TO WAIT HER OUT.

03:04.215 --> 03:06.257
THERE'S NO WAY PERRY CAN
ACTUALLY SEE OUR BIONICS

03:06.257 --> 03:07.788
UNLESS SHE RIPS OUR SKIN OFF.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.621
HAVE YOU MET CAROL AND DEB?

03:12.623 --> 03:14.795
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S IN THEIR WHEELHOUSE.

03:16.267 --> 03:17.798
Principal Perry:
OKAY, BYE.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.770
GREAT NEWS!
 YOU'RE LETTING US GO?

03:19.770 --> 03:21.502
NO! (laughs)

03:21.502 --> 03:24.575
I MADE A LITTLE CALL
OVER TO MY FRIEND CHET
OVER AT AIRPORT SECURITY,

03:24.575 --> 03:27.508
AND HE'S GONNA LET ME BORROW
AN X-RAY MACHINE.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.581
YOU HAVE A FRIEND
AT THE AIRPORT?

03:30.581 --> 03:33.914
WELL, ASK HIM IF
HE'LL LET ME PASS OUT PEANUTS
ON THE 5:10 TO DENVER.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.588
ONCE I GET THAT MACHINE,

03:37.588 --> 03:40.491
IT'LL SHOW ME WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE HIDING....

03:40.491 --> 03:43.454
WHEREVER IT IS
YOU'RE HIDING IT.

03:50.701 --> 03:52.703
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:52.703 --> 03:54.805
I LIVE HERE.

03:54.805 --> 03:57.938
I'M THE ONE YOU DIDN'T
 COBBLE TOGETHER
IN YOUR BASEMENT.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.671
I MEAN
WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL?

04:00.671 --> 04:02.743
GOT A LITTLE HEAD COLD.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.816
I SNEEZED IN CLASS,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OUT,

04:05.816 --> 04:08.849
BUT I WALKED OUT
TWO POUNDS LIGHTER.

04:08.849 --> 04:12.423
DONALD, I THINK
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD.

04:12.423 --> 04:14.685
WHEN I WENT TO BUY GROCERIES
IT WAS DECLINED.

04:14.685 --> 04:16.627
DECLINED?
HOW COULD THAT BE?

04:16.627 --> 04:18.659
LET ME SPELL IT OUT
FOR YOU.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.291
SHE SPENT ALL YOUR MONEY!

04:21.291 --> 04:24.295
I DID NOT SPEND
ALL HIS MONEY.

04:24.295 --> 04:26.867
OH, SAVING A LITTLE
FOR A FACELIFT?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.869
I--YOU--

04:28.869 --> 04:30.571
( tapping on keyboard )

04:30.571 --> 04:32.643
THIS CARD IS COMPLETELY
MAXED OUT

04:32.643 --> 04:34.875
WITH PURCHASES
I DIDN'T MAKE.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.907
A PLANE TICKET,
A SPEEDBOAT,

04:36.907 --> 04:38.949
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS' WORTH
OF HAIR DYE

04:38.949 --> 04:40.511
AND COLOR CONTACT LENSES.

04:41.512 --> 04:43.354
THIS TIME IT WAS NOT ME!

04:47.558 --> 04:50.391
( gleeful chuckle )
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF
THIS X-RAY MACHINE

04:50.391 --> 04:52.423
A LONG TIME AGO--
NOW I CAN BUST YOU THREE

04:52.423 --> 04:55.496
AND FIND OUT WHAT
THAT STABBING PAIN
IN MY KIDNEY IS.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.069
JUST GOTTA
POWER IT UP.

04:59.069 --> 05:01.772
THERE MUST BE A WAY
FOR US TO BREAK THIS MACHINE.

05:01.772 --> 05:04.505
HEY, WHAT IF I USE
MY BLAST WAVE ABILITY?

05:04.505 --> 05:08.339
YOU KNOW, WHERE I CONCENTRATE
REALLY HARD AND EVERYTHING
AROUND ME FALLS APART?

05:08.339 --> 05:10.040
OH! THAT'S RIGHT,

05:10.040 --> 05:13.514
I JUST KEEP FORGETTING THAT
YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY USELESS.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.746
Principal Perry:
OKAY, JUMBO,

05:15.746 --> 05:16.987
GET IN THERE!

05:16.987 --> 05:19.420
YOUR DAY OF RECKONING
HAS COME.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.554
UH... HEY, LOOK! THERE'S
A LITTLE BIRDY IN HERE!

05:23.554 --> 05:26.627
I'LL GET IT! MY CATS LOVE IT
WHEN MAMA BRINGS 'EM HOME
A TREAT!

05:27.928 --> 05:29.630
NOW!

05:30.731 --> 05:32.963
WHERE IS THAT
LITTLE FLYING RAT?

05:36.767 --> 05:38.108
WHOA! EARTHQUAKE!

05:38.108 --> 05:39.610
COVER ME! COVER ME!

05:39.610 --> 05:44.615
( rumbling,
electricity crackling

05:44.615 --> 05:48.379
WOW. THAT WAS SOME JOLT.

05:48.379 --> 05:49.720
OH, THAT WAS NOTHIN'.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.352
I ONCE GOT TRAPPED IN MY CAR
UNDERNEATH A PARKING GARAGE,

05:52.352 --> 05:55.125
HAD TO SURVIVE BY EATING
THREE CANS OF CAT FOOD

05:55.125 --> 05:57.958
AND THE LEATHER
FROM MY BUCKET SEATS.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.890
LONGEST TWO HOURS
OF MY LIFE!

06:02.533 --> 06:04.465
OHH! PUPPY HEADS!

06:04.465 --> 06:06.397
THE EARTHQUAKE
BROKE MY MACHINE!

06:06.397 --> 06:09.600
OH, NO.
THAT IS TERRIBLE.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.671
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.373
AAH! NOT SO FAST,
PIXIE!

06:13.373 --> 06:14.545
I CAN FIX THIS.

06:14.545 --> 06:16.877
YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT,
BUT I WORK WEEKENDS
AS A LUMBER GIRL

06:16.877 --> 06:18.509
DOWN AT THE TOOL TENT.

06:18.509 --> 06:21.612
NOBODY KNOWS THEIR WAY
AROUND A CLAW HAMMER
BETTER THAN I DO.

06:21.612 --> 06:24.384
I DO NOT DOUBT THAT.

06:30.961 --> 06:33.063
LEO, ANY LUCK
TRACING THOSE HACKERS?

06:33.063 --> 06:36.066
NO. EVERY I.P. ADDRESS
YOU GAVE ME LEADS TO
A DEAD END.

06:36.066 --> 06:37.998
THESE PEOPLE REALLY
COVERED THEIR TRACKS.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.000
I DON'T HAVE
ANY FINGERPRINTS
OR EVIDENCE,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.133
BUT I'VE DRAWN A POLICE SKETCH
OF WHAT I THINK THE SUSPECT
LOOKS LIKE.

06:48.479 --> 06:50.481
I CAN'T ACCESS ANYTHING.

06:50.481 --> 06:53.544
ALL THE CONTENTS
OF MY CYBERDESK
HAVE BEEN WIPED CLEAN.

06:54.645 --> 06:57.117
( beeping )
 THIS IS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.691
EVERY ONE OF MY FACILITIES
WORLDWIDE HAS BEEN HACKED.

07:00.691 --> 07:04.855
EVERY DATABASE--
THE ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES IS GONE!

07:06.727 --> 07:10.461
THIS IS NOT SOME
RUN-OF-THE-MILL
COMPUTER HACKER, LEO.

07:10.461 --> 07:12.503
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE
WHO HATES ME

07:12.503 --> 07:14.735
AND WANTS TO RUIN MY LIFE.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.508
WELL, THAT COULD BE ANYONE.
 (sarcastic)
ALL RIGHT.

07:17.508 --> 07:18.769
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

07:18.769 --> 07:20.971
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL
MY FRIEND AT THE FBI.

07:20.971 --> 07:23.574
YOU HAVE A FRIEND
AT THE FBI?

07:23.574 --> 07:24.945
WOW! THAT IS SO COOL.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.647
YEAH, WE'RE YOGA BUDDIES.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.018
AND NOW IT'S NOT COOL.

07:30.981 --> 07:33.153
ALL RIGHTIE.
LEFTY-LOOSEY,

07:33.153 --> 07:35.586
RIGHTIE...
CRAM IT IN THERE!!!

07:37.087 --> 07:40.460
UHHHH! I CAN'T FIX IT!

07:40.460 --> 07:43.494
YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS
WE'D ALL LOVE TO SIT HERE

07:43.494 --> 07:45.796
AND WATCH YOU MASTER
THE ART OF SCREWDRIVING,

07:45.796 --> 07:46.937
WE'RE GONNA GO.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.102
HOLD IT!!!

07:52.102 --> 07:54.775
YOU THREE GOT LUCKY,
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE
UP TO SOMETHING.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.508
( electrical crackling )

07:57.508 --> 08:00.681
YOU'RE BLAST WAVE
MUST HAVE LOOSENED
THE ELECTRICAL BOX.

08:01.552 --> 08:03.483
EH, JUST A LITTLE FIRE HAZARD.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.715
I'LL FIX IT NEXT WEEK.

08:04.715 --> 08:07.257
( louder crackling )
 AAAAH!

08:07.257 --> 08:08.689
LOOK OUT!

08:08.689 --> 08:10.160
HUH?! UHHHH!

08:11.522 --> 08:14.164
WE GOTTA STOP THAT WIRE
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS
ELECTROCUTED!

08:14.164 --> 08:16.567
I'LL STABILIZE IT,
YOU SEVER IT!

08:16.567 --> 08:20.571
( electricity crackling,
signals oscillating )

08:20.571 --> 08:22.072
OKAY, NOW!

08:27.137 --> 08:28.679
Adam: YEAH!
 Chase: YES!

08:31.241 --> 08:32.743
AND...

08:32.743 --> 08:34.914
THAT'S OUR MAGIC SHOW.
 TA-DA!

08:37.548 --> 08:40.650
AAAAHHHHH!!!!

08:40.650 --> 08:42.893
( door slams shut )

08:42.893 --> 08:44.054
UH-OH.

08:44.054 --> 08:46.897
WE'RE DEAD.
 WOW.

08:46.897 --> 08:49.529
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER RUN.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.211
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
YOU CAN COME OUT,
IT'S OKAY!

09:01.211 --> 09:03.013
WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

09:03.013 --> 09:05.015
YEAH, WHAT SHE MEANS IS
IT'LL ONLY HURT
FOR A SECOND

09:05.015 --> 09:06.546
AND THEN YOU'LL
PROBABLY PASS OUT.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.151
STAND BACK, FREAKS!

09:11.151 --> 09:13.584
I ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING OFF ABOUT YOU THREE,

09:13.584 --> 09:16.587
BUT NOW I KNOW THE TRUTH--
YOU'RE MARTIANS!

09:17.958 --> 09:20.290
YEEES,
WE'RE MARTIANS.

09:20.290 --> 09:23.163
YOU DON'T SEE
A HEAD LIKE THAT
ON A HUMAN.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.265
WE'RE NOT MARTIANS.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.197
WE'RE HUMANS WITH
BIONIC ABILITIES.

09:27.197 --> 09:29.940
I HAVE SUPER STRENGTH,
SHE HAS SUPER SPEED,
AND CHASE--

09:29.940 --> 09:31.642
WHAT DO YOU DO AGAIN?

09:33.904 --> 09:35.575
YOU'RE BIONIC?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.347
I'VE SEEN MOVIES
ABOUT YOU PEOPLE.

09:37.347 --> 09:40.010
YOU ACT ALL NICE,
AND THEN AN HOUR IN,

09:40.010 --> 09:42.252
YOU TURN AND TRY TO
KILL WILL SMITH!

09:43.954 --> 09:47.117
NO. WE USE OUR ABILITIES
FOR GOOD THINGS.

09:47.117 --> 09:49.359
LIKE LIFE-SAVING MISSIONS--

09:49.359 --> 09:52.893
FOR INSTANCE, THE WAY
WE JUST SAVED YOURS.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.695
AAAAH! STAY AWAY FROM ME!

09:54.695 --> 09:57.127
I'VE GOTTA GO
CALL THE COPS!
OR THE FBI!

09:57.127 --> 09:58.929
OR--OR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT!

09:58.929 --> 10:02.803
UHH! THINK, TERRY!
WHAT WOULD WILL SMITH DO?

10:09.239 --> 10:10.881
ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

10:10.881 --> 10:12.182
OUR NORMAL LIVES ARE OVER.

10:12.182 --> 10:15.045
I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
TO MY PUDDING.

10:15.045 --> 10:16.717
OKAY, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.919
WE HAVE TO TELL
MR. DAVENPORT.
 RIGHT.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.822
LET'S JUST TELL HIM
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.294
ARE YOU CRAZY?!
WE CAN'T TELL MR. DAVENPORT!

10:24.294 --> 10:26.096
IT WAS YOUR IDEA!

10:26.096 --> 10:28.899
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE GONNA
START LISTENING TO ME?!

10:28.899 --> 10:30.360
( doorbell )

10:30.360 --> 10:33.964
WAIT. DON'T ANSWER IT.
IT COULD BE THE AUTHORITIES.

10:33.964 --> 10:37.207
OR WE WON A SWEEPSTAKES.

10:37.207 --> 10:40.270
I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT I'M WILLING TO
TAKE THE RISK.

10:40.270 --> 10:41.271
( doorbell )

10:41.271 --> 10:42.843
AM I THE ONLY PERSON

10:42.843 --> 10:44.815
CAPABLE OF ANSWERING THE DOOR?

10:47.147 --> 10:50.080
FBI. I NEED TO SEE
DONALD DAVENPORT.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.883
DONALD! YOU BETTER
COME DOWNSTAIRS!

10:52.883 --> 10:55.155
THE FBI IS HERE!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.659
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.032
HA HA HA HA.

11:02.032 --> 11:03.834
DONALD!!!

11:06.436 --> 11:08.298
GUYS! WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?!

11:08.298 --> 11:10.170
OHH. WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.042
YOU'RE SO SMALL THEY PROBABLY
WON'T EVEN SEE YOU.

11:12.042 --> 11:16.176
ADAM, IS THIS
REALLY THE TIME
TO BE MAKING SHORT JOKES?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.048
CHASE, THERE IS NEVER
 NOT A TIME,

11:18.048 --> 11:20.881
BECAUSE JUST LIKE YOU,
LIFE IS SHORT.

11:22.112 --> 11:24.214
WILL YOU STOP IT?

11:24.214 --> 11:26.456
THE FBI IS UPSTAIRS
READY TO DRAG US AWAY,

11:26.456 --> 11:29.189
AND WHO KNOWS THAT THEY'LL DO
TO MR. DAVENPORT!

11:29.189 --> 11:32.092
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
FAST.

11:32.092 --> 11:36.026
DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD
A LONG TIME AGO...

11:36.026 --> 11:38.869
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED LIVING
AS NORMAL KIDS?

11:38.869 --> 11:42.132
THE ONE YOU TOLD ME TO
FORGET AND NEVER BRING UP?

11:42.132 --> 11:44.805
NO.

11:46.236 --> 11:48.708
THE ONE WHERE WE MADE
A "LAST RESORT" PACT

11:48.708 --> 11:51.211
IF ANYONE EVER DISCOVERED
OUR BIONIC SECRET.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.916
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.
DID YOU NOT SEE ME WINK?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.347
IT'S TIME.

11:57.347 --> 12:00.991
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES
AND MR. DAVENPORT.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.754
ARE YOU IN?

12:05.155 --> 12:06.196
I'M IN.

12:07.357 --> 12:09.199
BREE?

12:09.199 --> 12:12.102
OUR LIVES WILL
CHANGE FOREVER.

12:12.102 --> 12:13.403
I KNOW.

12:13.403 --> 12:15.906
BUT THERE'S JUST GOTTA
BE ANOTHER WAY TO--

12:15.906 --> 12:16.907
BREE.

12:18.368 --> 12:20.740
WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

12:24.514 --> 12:26.416
I'M IN.

12:34.184 --> 12:36.887
HEY, BIG D,
WHAT HAPPENED WITH
YOUR FRIEND AT THE FBI?

12:36.887 --> 12:39.229
HE JUST LEFT.
I GAVE HIM ALL
THE INFORMATION,

12:39.229 --> 12:42.432
BUT HE SAID THIS HACKING
IS BEYOND ANYTHING
HE'S EVER SEEN BEFORE.

12:42.432 --> 12:45.065
IT'S GONNA BE WEEKS BEFORE
THEY HAVE ANY LEADS.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.336
( knock on door )

12:46.336 --> 12:48.839
( insistent knocking )

12:52.172 --> 12:54.044
PRINCIPAL PERRY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:54.044 --> 12:56.446
DOES OUR FRONT GATE
EVEN HAVE A CODE?

12:56.446 --> 12:58.909
YOU DON'T RUN A WOMEN'S
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

12:58.909 --> 13:01.351
WITHOUT LEARNING HOW
TO SCALE A FEW WALLS.

13:01.351 --> 13:03.253
ANYHOO...

13:03.253 --> 13:06.356
I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY,
SAY HELLO...

13:06.356 --> 13:09.459
AND TELL YOU THAT
I KNOW YOUR KIDS ARE BIONIC!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.364
HA HA HA HA! BIONIC!

13:14.364 --> 13:16.226
WHAT? I DON'T--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:16.226 --> 13:18.068
I DON'T THINK SO.
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE

13:18.068 --> 13:20.831
A CHILD SAYS
THEY'RE BIONIC--

13:20.831 --> 13:22.873
THE BIG ONE SHOT LASERS
FROM HIS EYES,

13:22.873 --> 13:24.374
THE GIRL RAN FASTER
THAN LIGHTNING,

13:24.374 --> 13:27.337
AND THE STUMPY ONE COULD
MOVE THINGS WITH HIS MIND!

13:29.509 --> 13:31.842
OH, YEAH,
SHE'S GOT YOU.

13:33.844 --> 13:35.015
IS HE BIONIC TOO?

13:35.015 --> 13:36.246
SERIOUSLY? LOOK AT HIM.

13:38.188 --> 13:41.291
LEO, GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND BRING ADAM, CHASE AND BREE
UP HERE NOW.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.195
OH, HELLO,
PRINCIPAL PERRY.

13:45.195 --> 13:46.927
HELLO, TASHA.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.600
DONALD,
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 SHE KNOWS.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.601
KNOWS WHAT?

13:52.903 --> 13:54.204
OHHHH.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.837
THEY WERE HERE
WHEN I GOT HERE!

13:59.469 --> 14:02.212
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LOOK SO NERVOUS, DON.

14:02.212 --> 14:05.515
I GOTTA SAY,
IT'S REAL NICE.

14:05.515 --> 14:09.119
LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

14:09.119 --> 14:10.450
HA! NO NEED.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.123
MY FIRST INSTINCT
WAS TO GO STRAIGHT
TO THE AUTHORITIES,

14:13.123 --> 14:15.855
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,
I'VE GOT SECRETS TOO--

14:15.855 --> 14:19.159
A LADY OF MYSTERY,
IF YOU WILL.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.262
SO YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP THIS BETWEEN US?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.333
OH, THANK YOU--

14:25.865 --> 14:28.098
NOT QUITE.
I'LL KEEP YOUR SECRET,

14:28.098 --> 14:29.499
BUT IT'S GONNA COST YOU--

14:29.499 --> 14:31.201
A LOT.

14:31.201 --> 14:34.244
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,
BLACKMAILING US?

14:34.244 --> 14:36.146
WE WILL NEVER--
 DEAL.

14:36.146 --> 14:38.108
WHAT?! YOU'RE JUST
GONNA LET HER WIN?

14:38.108 --> 14:41.311
YES. IF IT ALLOWS US
TO KEEP OUR FAMILY
TOGETHER.

14:41.311 --> 14:46.416
(sighs) SO THE LEPRECHAUN
FINALLY GOT HER POT OF GOLD.

14:48.458 --> 14:52.462
I'M GONNA BE RICH,
I'M GONNA BE RICH,
I'M GONNA BE RICH!

14:52.462 --> 14:54.965
( knock on door )
 OH, WHAT NOW?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.370
DONALD DAVENPORT,

15:00.370 --> 15:03.173
WE'RE WITH THE FIRST
INTERNATIONAL BANK.

15:03.173 --> 15:06.906
THIS HOUSE
AND EVERYTHING IN IT
NO LONGER BELONGS TO YOU.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.678
WHAT?! THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

15:08.678 --> 15:11.081
I HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN YOUR BANK!

15:11.081 --> 15:16.286
NOT ANYMORE.
ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS
WERE LIQUIDATED HOURS AGO.

15:16.286 --> 15:18.088
I NEVER AUTHORIZED THAT!

15:18.088 --> 15:21.091
WELL, YOUR SIGNATURE
SAYS OTHERWISE.

15:21.091 --> 15:22.322
MY SIG--

15:22.322 --> 15:23.693
WH-WHAT--

15:23.693 --> 15:27.457
LOOK, WHOEVER HACKED MY ACCOUNTS
MUST HAVE FORGED MY SIGNATURE.

15:27.457 --> 15:29.929
THAT MAY WELL BE,
MR. DAVENPORT,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.062
BUT UNTIL WE STRAIGHTEN
THIS MESS OUT,

15:32.062 --> 15:34.664
WE ARE GOING TO SEIZE
ALL YOUR ASSETS.

15:34.664 --> 15:36.206
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:36.206 --> 15:38.538
I MEAN, YOU'RE BROKE.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.042
I'M BRO--

15:42.042 --> 15:43.213
YOU'RE BROKE?!

15:45.115 --> 15:48.218
DONALD?
THEY'RE TOWING THE CARS!

15:48.218 --> 15:51.251
WOW! ROUGH DAY!

15:51.251 --> 15:53.053
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.454
I MEANT FOR ME.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.728
WELL, I GUESS OUR
LITTLE DEAL IS OFF.
 WHAT?

15:58.728 --> 16:02.032
IF YOU'RE BROKE,
YOU CAN'T BUY MY SILENCE.

16:02.032 --> 16:05.195
OHH, WHAT TO DO,
WHAT TO DO...

16:06.736 --> 16:09.099
THIS ISN'T OVER!

16:11.501 --> 16:12.702
WAIT.

16:19.209 --> 16:21.151
BIG D, WE HAVE
A PROBLEM.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.253
LEO, WHERE ARE ADAM,
BREE AND CHASE?

16:23.253 --> 16:25.115
I FOUND THIS IN THE LAB.

16:28.418 --> 16:31.021
HELLO. TESTING, TESTING.

16:31.021 --> 16:32.492
ECHO. ECHO.

16:35.225 --> 16:37.627
MR. DAVENPORT...

16:37.627 --> 16:40.130
WE REALLY
MESSED UP.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.173
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO EXPOSE
OUR BIONICS TO PERRY,

16:43.173 --> 16:47.237
BUT...SHE WAS IN DANGER
AND WE HAD NO CHOICE.

16:47.237 --> 16:50.080
YOU ALWAYS TRAINED US
TO HANDLE ANY MISSION,

16:50.080 --> 16:52.712
AND RIGHT NOW,
THE MISSION IS SURVIVAL--

16:52.712 --> 16:54.644
YOURS AND OURS.

16:54.644 --> 16:58.688
I MEAN, IF WE'RE NOT AROUND
THERE'S NO PROOF THAT WE EXIST,

16:58.688 --> 17:01.191
SO WE'RE LEAVING.

17:01.191 --> 17:02.522
FOR GOOD.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.596
THANK YOU...

17:06.596 --> 17:09.028
FOR ALL THAT
YOU'VE DONE FOR US.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.631
YOU MADE US WHO WE ARE.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.233
WE'RE SORRY
WE LET YOU DOWN.

17:19.108 --> 17:20.770
I'VE GOT TO FIND THEM.

17:20.770 --> 17:24.114
I ALREADY TRIED.
THEY MUST HAVE DISABLED
THEIR GPS SIGNALS.

17:24.114 --> 17:27.117
THERE'S NO TRACE
OF THEM ANYWHERE.

17:27.117 --> 17:28.278
THEY'RE GONE.

17:38.688 --> 17:41.191
Leo: THE GUY FROM THE BANK
SAYS WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW.

17:41.191 --> 17:43.563
THEY'RE CHANGING THE LOCKS
ON ALL THE DOORS.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.236
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GONE.

17:46.236 --> 17:48.198
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

17:48.198 --> 17:52.202
IT'S MY JOB TO WATCH OUT
FOR THEM, AND I DIDN'T.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

17:52.202 --> 17:54.474
NO, IT'S NOT.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.447
IT'S NOT THEIRS, EITHER.
I GOTTA FIND THEM.

18:00.450 --> 18:04.184
I CAN'T EVEN USE MY CYBERDESK.
WHO IS DOING THIS TO ME?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.787
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A TECH WHIZ

18:07.787 --> 18:09.789
WHO WILL DO ANYTHING
TO DESTROY YOU,

18:09.789 --> 18:12.392
SOMEONE WHO HAS
INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE

18:12.392 --> 18:15.225
OF YOUR LIFE
AND DAVENPORT
INDUSTRIES AND--

18:16.296 --> 18:19.429
WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW WHO IT IS.

18:19.429 --> 18:21.171
IT'S YOUR BROTHER.

18:21.171 --> 18:25.175
LEO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WE FROZE DOUGLAS IN
A BLOCK OF ICE.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.606
HE'S UNDER 24-HOUR SECURITY

18:26.606 --> 18:29.209
AT MY MOST REMOTE
OFFSHORE FACILITY.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.180
SEE?

18:32.282 --> 18:34.214
HE'S GONE. BUT--

18:34.214 --> 18:35.445
HOW?

18:35.445 --> 18:37.187
REWIND THE FOOTAGE.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.290
GO BACK.
THERE IT IS.

18:47.157 --> 18:48.158
HEY!

18:51.201 --> 18:52.632
AHH!

18:52.632 --> 18:53.703
AHHH.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.742
WHOA.
THERE'S ANOTHER
BIONIC DUDE?

19:02.742 --> 19:04.514
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

19:33.443 --> 19:36.876
IF DOUGLAS ESCAPED,
THAT MEANS ADAM, BREE
AND CHASE ARE IN REAL DANGER.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.448
WE ALL ARE.

19:38.448 --> 19:40.610
YOU SURE ARE, DONNIE.

19:41.781 --> 19:45.285
HA HA HA! I'M BA-ACK!

19:45.285 --> 19:46.816
( evil laughter )

19:46.816 --> 19:49.389
YEAH, LEO ALREADY
FIGURED THAT OUT.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.592
ANYWAY, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW

19:52.592 --> 19:55.365
THAT IT WAS ME
WHO DID THIS TO YA.

19:55.365 --> 19:57.827
WELL, I HAD A LITTLE HELP.

19:57.827 --> 19:59.369
AND NOW THAT I'M FREE,

19:59.369 --> 20:01.301
I THINK I'LL SPEND
SOME QUALITY TIME

20:01.301 --> 20:04.203
WITH MY THREE WONDERFUL KIDS.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.936
YOU ANYWHERE NEAR THEM,
IT'LL BE THE LAST THING
YOU EVER DO!

20:06.936 --> 20:08.938
THEY'RE MINE, DONNIE!

20:08.938 --> 20:11.281
I'LL FIND THEM FIRST.

20:11.281 --> 20:13.343
GOOD LUCK.
THAT'S GONNA BE

20:13.343 --> 20:15.745
A LITTLE HARD TO DO
WITHOUT YOUR LAB.

20:15.745 --> 20:18.688
HA HA HA HA!
BRAH-HA-HA-HA-HA!

20:18.688 --> 20:19.989
LEO, THAT'S A DETONATOR!
RUN!

20:19.989 --> 20:21.651
( rapid beeping )

20:45.375 --> 20:47.617
THE PHONE IS DEAD.

20:47.617 --> 20:49.719
HOPEFULLY MY SPRINKLER SYSTEM
EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE

20:49.719 --> 20:51.921
BEFORE IT SPREAD TO
THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

20:51.921 --> 20:54.884
SO WE'RE TRAPPED IN HERE?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

20:54.884 --> 20:56.686
I'M WORKING ON IT, LEO.

20:56.686 --> 20:58.288
WELL, HURRY UP.

20:58.288 --> 21:00.530
I MEAN, IF WE DON'T
GET OUT OF HERE,

21:00.530 --> 21:01.891
DOUGLAS AND THAT
CREEPY MASK GUY

21:01.891 --> 21:03.593
ARE GONNA BEAT US TO
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE.

21:03.593 --> 21:05.735
I WILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT,
LEO.

21:05.735 --> 21:09.268
HOW?! YOUR LAB IS GONE,
YOUR CARS ARE GONE,

21:09.268 --> 21:10.640
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES
IS RUINED!

21:10.640 --> 21:12.442
I GOT IT, LEO!

21:12.442 --> 21:15.044
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,
YOU'RE COMPLETELY BROKE.

21:19.379 --> 21:23.653
( sobbing )

21:26.055 --> 21:28.688
I'M CRYING ABOUT THE KIDS!

21:28.688 --> 21:29.789
( sobbing continues )
