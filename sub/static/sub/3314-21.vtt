WEBVTT

00:06.250 --> 00:08.289
MEL, I KNEW WE'D GET ALL
THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT.

00:08.290 --> 00:11.289
IN FACT, I FELT SO SURE THAT
NOW WAS YOUR TIME TO RUN,

00:11.290 --> 00:12.539
I GOT YOU THIS.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.119
(gasps) A CAMPAIGN MUG!

00:15.120 --> 00:17.540
"FOR CONGRESS, MEL BURKA."

00:19.290 --> 00:20.749
IT'S JUST A PROTOTYPE.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.459
WHEN WE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE,

00:22.460 --> 00:25.499
WE'LL SPRING FOR THE COMPANY WITH
THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PROOFREADERS.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.789
YOU KNOW, HOLDING THIS, I
AM STARTING TO BELIEVE

00:27.790 --> 00:29.580
THAT MEL BURKA COULD
BE IN CONGRESS.

00:30.580 --> 00:33.209
I WOULDN'T BE DOING ALL THIS
FUNDRAISING IF I DIDN'T AGREE.

00:33.210 --> 00:35.039
HEY, HONEY. HEY, HANK.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.119
HEY! HANK!

00:37.120 --> 00:39.079
I'M ACTUALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE, MAN, 'CAUSE
I SORT OF WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

00:39.080 --> 00:41.459
TO KIND OF CLEAR THE AIR AFTER WHAT
HAPPENED THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.829
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS ALL
HYPED UP AND HAD THAT, UM...

00:43.830 --> 00:45.579
YOU KNOW, THE WHITE
POWDER UNDER MY NOSE.

00:45.580 --> 00:48.959
RIGHT. THE POWDERED SUGAR.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.879
EXACTLY, YEAH. WHY
DID YOU JUST WINK?

00:50.880 --> 00:52.539
THERE WAS NO WINK
NECESSARY THERE.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.119
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU JUST WINKED?

00:54.120 --> 00:57.709
YOUR STORY OF RECOVERY IS
VERY RELATABLE TO VOTERS,

00:57.710 --> 01:00.459
WHICH IS VITAL
DURING A CAMPAIGN.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.040
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

01:03.210 --> 01:05.169
JOE, THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

01:05.170 --> 01:07.249
IS THAT NOW YOU ARE
CLEAN AND SOBER.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.539
(phone rings)

01:08.540 --> 01:10.039
OH. EXCUSE ME.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.620
WELL...

01:12.670 --> 01:14.329
SO, JUST SO I UNDERSTAND,

01:14.330 --> 01:17.459
YOU CLEARED EVERYTHING UP WITH HANK,
AND HE STILL THINKS I'M A COKE ADDICT?

01:17.460 --> 01:20.710
NO. A RECOVERING COKE ADDICT.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.670
WE'RE ALL SO PROUD OF YOU.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.039
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE OKAY WITH THAT?

01:50.040 --> 01:52.879
I AM.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.879
I'M NOT! ALL RIGHT?

01:54.880 --> 01:58.169
ALL I DID WAS POUND TOO MANY ENERGY
DRINKS AND SNIFF A SUGAR-COATED CANNOLI.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.169
WHO CARES WHAT HANK THINKS?

02:00.170 --> 02:02.249
HONEY, I CARE!

02:02.250 --> 02:04.119
I HAVE A BOOK OUT RIGHT NOW TO SEVERAL
PUBLISHERS ON HOW TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.169
AND THERE IS NO CHAPTER
IN LONGO LIFE ENTITLED,

02:07.170 --> 02:09.460
"HOW TO GET WHAT YOU WANT
BY SNORTING COCAINE."

02:11.080 --> 02:12.959
IF THOSE PUBLISHERS THINK
I'M A COKE ADDICT...

02:12.960 --> 02:16.749
AH, AH, AH! RECOVERING
COKE ADDICT.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.210
HA. THAT JOKE NEVER GETS FUNNY.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.289
JUST GOT A PLEDGE FOR A $10,000
DONATION TO YOUR CAMPAIGN, MEL.

02:25.290 --> 02:27.619
WOW, THAT'S AMAZING!
WHO'S THE DONOR?

02:27.620 --> 02:28.920
ANOTHER FORMER ADDICT.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.919
THEY'RE VERY GENEROUS.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.210
PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY
NOW THAT IT'S NOT GOING UP THEIR NOSES.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.379
WHEN WE GO PUBLIC
WITH JOE'S STORY,

02:39.380 --> 02:41.579
JUST WATCH THE DOLLARS ROLL IN.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.619
YEAH. ABOUT THAT. UM...

02:43.620 --> 02:46.619
LOOK, HANK, I AM GAME FOR
ANYTHING IN THIS CAMPAIGN,

02:46.620 --> 02:48.999
EXCEPT USING JOE'S
PERSONAL STRUGGLE.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.249
WE NEED TO RESPECT HIS PRIVACY.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.919
MEL, AIRING YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY
REALLY DRUMS UP SYMPATHY.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.079
YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.379
FINANCIAL SCANDALS,
SECRET CHILDREN...

02:58.380 --> 03:01.079
OOH! JOE, TWO FOR TWO!

03:01.080 --> 03:03.419
NO.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.669
SORRY. OFF LIMITS.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.669
ALL RIGHT. BUT, LISTEN, MEL,

03:07.670 --> 03:11.079
ONCE YOU COMMIT TO RUNNING FOR
OFFICE, IT'S OPEN SEASON.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PRESS.

03:12.001 --> 03:14.919
REGULAR PEOPLE WILL COME
AFTER YOU WITH A VICIOUSNESS

03:14.920 --> 03:17.669
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
REGULAR PEOPLE HAD.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.419
YOU CAN'T SCARE ME, OKAY?

03:19.420 --> 03:21.499
I'VE BEEN TO BASEMENT
SALES ON BLACK FRIDAY.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.919
ONCE I TOOK A BELT BUCKLE TO THE
EYE, BUT STILL WALKED OUT OF THERE

03:24.920 --> 03:26.079
WITH TWO PRADA PURSES.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.039
HALF OFF, BABY!

03:28.040 --> 03:31.789
I'M JUST SAYING, THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
COULD BE PRETTY STOMACH-CHURNING.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.079
I AM UP FOR IT.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.419
I KNOW YOU ARE.

03:34.420 --> 03:37.960
BUT, I'M JUST WORRIED THE PRESSURE
MIGHT SEND JOE BACK TO THE COKE.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.879
YOU KNOW WHAT, HANK? I'M GONNA
BE GOOD, MAN. I'M GONNA BE GOOD.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.709
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I
FEEL THAT TEMPTATION,

03:45.710 --> 03:48.709
ALL I NEED TO DO IS LOOK IN MY
WIFE'S EYES, AND SHE SINGS TO ME.

03:48.710 --> 03:50.789
YOU KNOW THAT OLD
SONG, "ERIE CANAL"?

03:50.790 --> 03:52.499
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
ABOUT THAT SONG, MAN,

03:52.500 --> 03:55.039
BUT EVERY TIME I HEAR IT, I DON'T
CRAVE THE NOSE SUGAR ANYMORE.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.040
HEY, HONEY. HONEY,
SING ME THE SONG.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.619
NO, I...

04:01.620 --> 04:03.459
HANK DOESN'T WANT TO
HEAR THAT OLD SONG.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.670
I NEED YOU TO SING THE
SONG FOR MY RECOVERY.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.620
AS A COKE ADDICT.

04:11.790 --> 04:14.079
(nervous laughter)

04:14.080 --> 04:18.289
♪ I'VE GOT A MULE,
HER NAME IS SAL ♪

04:18.290 --> 04:20.669
♪ 15 YEARS ON THE ERIE CANAL ♪

04:20.670 --> 04:22.329
THERE. DONE.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.879
I NEED MORE, BABY!
I NEED MORE, BABY!

04:23.880 --> 04:25.040
THAT DRAGON IS STILL
CALLING MY NAME!

04:27.960 --> 04:30.919
♪ LOW BRIDGE, EVERYBODY DOWN ♪

04:30.920 --> 04:34.459
♪ LOW BRIDGE 'CAUSE WE'RE
COMING TO A TOWN ♪

04:34.460 --> 04:36.579
D.C., THAT'S THE TOWN
WE'RE COMING TO!

04:36.580 --> 04:39.709
YEAH IT IS! I SO DON'T
WANT TO DO COKE RIGHT NOW!

04:39.710 --> 04:41.500
SING OUT, HONEY!

04:43.790 --> 04:45.379
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.459
MY ROOMMATES KICKED ME OUT.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.499
WHY?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.169
NO REASON. JUST PURE GIRL SPITE.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.380
AND, YOU KNOW, I MAY
NOT HAVE PAID RENT.

04:54.330 --> 04:56.079
FOR THREE MONTHS.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.499
THREE MONTHS?

04:57.500 --> 04:58.879
BUT, I THOUGHT YOUR
PARENTS GAVE YOU MONEY?

04:58.880 --> 05:00.079
WELL, I KINDA RAN THROUGH IT.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.330
YOU KNOW, I'M AN ARTIST,
NOT A BUDGETER MAN.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.999
OKAY.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.789
WELL, YOU KNOW, I
HATE TO SAY THIS,

05:06.790 --> 05:09.379
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK
YOUR PARENTS TO LET YOU MOVE BACK IN.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.499
LENNOX, PLEASE, I HAVE MY PRIDE.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.790
AND I ALREADY ASKED.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.539
SEE, THEY'RE RENTING
OUT MY ROOM.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.879
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WON'T
EVEN LOOK AT MY APPLICATION,

05:17.880 --> 05:19.540
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY
KNOW MY CREDIT SUCKS.

05:24.330 --> 05:25.959
- HEY, MAN.
- HEY.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.169
WHOA! THAT LOOKS HEALTHY.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.329
YEAH. YOU KNOW THE NAVY'S MOTTO:

05:30.330 --> 05:32.670
A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD...
SALADS.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.749
PERMISSION TO ENTER
THE KITCHEN, SIR?

05:35.750 --> 05:37.749
YOU DON'T NEED TO SALUTE
ME SINCE YOU OUTRANK ME.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.880
WELL, WHAT'S YOUR RANK?
CUTEST POSSIBLE SAILOR?

05:42.500 --> 05:43.789
SO, HANK JUST LEFT.

05:43.790 --> 05:47.539
TODAY WAS OUR FIRST DAY OF
UNOFFICIAL OFFICIAL CAMPAIGNING.

05:47.540 --> 05:48.959
THAT WAS UNNECESSARILY
CONFUSING.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.960
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU SOUND
LIKE A CONGRESSPERSON ALREADY.

05:52.460 --> 05:53.789
REMEMBER HOW I
CO-SPONSORED THAT BILL

05:53.790 --> 05:55.539
TO GET VEGETABLES IN ALL THE
SCHOOL VENDING MACHINES?

05:55.540 --> 05:57.289
WELL, HANK LOVED THAT.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.879
SO, TOMORROW I'M GOING TO
FIVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

05:59.880 --> 06:01.039
TO TALK TO KIDS ABOUT
HEALTHY DIETS.

06:01.040 --> 06:05.329
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE
NEW FACE OF VEGETABLES.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.999
YOU KNOW, AUNT MEL, BEFORE YOU
BECOME THE NEW FACE OF VEGETABLES,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.119
YOU MIGHT WANNA TRY ONE.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.879
I'VE HAD PLENTY OF
VEGETABLES, OKAY?

06:10.880 --> 06:13.329
ONIONS, CELERY, OLIVES...

06:13.330 --> 06:16.209
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A VEGETABLE THAT
WASN'T FOUND IN A BLOODY MARY?

06:16.210 --> 06:19.289
KIDS ARE NOT GONNA ASK ME THAT.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.749
HERE. TRY A BRUSSELS SPROUT.

06:21.750 --> 06:22.789
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

06:22.790 --> 06:24.619
OH, HONEY, IT'S SO GOOD.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

06:24.620 --> 06:27.580
IT'S LIKE A YUMMY LITTLE
GREEN BALL OF PUDDING.

06:28.710 --> 06:30.080
OKAY, YOU BETTER NOT BE LYING.

06:32.790 --> 06:37.999
UGH! I CAN NEVER
TRUST YOU AGAIN!

06:38.000 --> 06:39.880
THERE IT IS. THAT'S THE
FACE OF VEGETABLES.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.789
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE
GOING TO THE MOVIES.

06:43.790 --> 06:46.459
OH, AND BY THE WAY, ZANDER HAS NO PLACE TO
LIVE, SO HE'S MOVING INTO MY ROOM. BYE.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.749
- WHOA! -COME BACK,
COME BACK, COME BACK!

06:48.750 --> 06:50.539
WELL, ZANDER'S
PARENTS CUT HIM OFF,

06:50.540 --> 06:51.999
SO HE'S GOT NO PLACE TO LIVE.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.620
NO PLACE. NOT EVEN ONE PLACE.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.919
SO, I INVITED HIM
TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.499
IT'S TEMPORARY. REST
OF THE SEMESTER.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.829
JUST TILL ZANDER FIGURES OUT A
MORE PERMANENT LIVING ARRANGEMENT.

07:03.830 --> 07:06.749
SO, CAN I KEEP HIM?

07:06.750 --> 07:08.379
- OF COURSE.
- NO.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.709
COME ON, MEL, MOVING IN
TOGETHER'S A BIG STEP.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.169
THEY JUST SAID IT'S TEMPORARY.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.579
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FINE. FINE.

07:14.580 --> 07:16.789
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIVING HERE,
UNDER OUR ROOF, EATING OUR FOOD,

07:16.790 --> 07:17.830
THERE WILL BE COSTS.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.920
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU WANT ME TO PAY RENT?

07:22.620 --> 07:23.709
SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.329
OH.

07:25.330 --> 07:27.669
SEE, THAT'S THE THING, THAT'S WHY I
WAS KICKED OUT OF MY LAST PLACE.

07:27.670 --> 07:31.379
'CAUSE I'M NOT A VERY
GOOD BUDGETER MAN.

07:31.380 --> 07:32.879
YOU HAVE ANY MONEY AT ALL?

07:32.880 --> 07:35.119
- LIKE, ON ME?
- AT ALL?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.669
OH. YEAH, NO, SIR.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.829
OKAY, WELL, IF YOU
CAN'T PAY RENT,

07:39.830 --> 07:41.959
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EARN
YOUR KEEP BY DOING SOME CHORES.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.579
CHORES? WHAT IS HE, 11?

07:43.580 --> 07:44.879
I LIVE HERE AND I
DON'T EVEN DO CHORES.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.209
OH, WE CAN FIX THAT.

07:46.210 --> 07:48.460
NO, HE SHOULD
DEFINITELY DO CHORES.

07:51.290 --> 07:53.789
SO, YOU KNOW, I HAD TO
REARRANGE A FEW THINGS.

07:53.790 --> 07:56.999
BUT LOOK, ZANDER'S ARTIST MODEL
AND MY HELLO KITTY PLUSHIE.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.499
I THINK THEY MIGHT HOOK UP.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.999
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.119
THERE REALLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT
OF ROOM IN HERE FOR TWO PEOPLE.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.919
IT'S... COZY.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.999
Zander: SLOW, SLOW.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.669
- OKAY, QUICK.
- MY FINGERS ARE SLIPPING.

08:08.670 --> 08:10.579
- WE'LL GO QUICK. THERE WE GO.
- YUP, YUP.

08:10.580 --> 08:12.329
AHA!

08:12.330 --> 08:14.459
WHOO!

08:14.460 --> 08:16.539
PERFECT.

08:16.540 --> 08:20.709
WOW, YOUR DRAFTING TABLE TAKES UP
A LOT MORE ROOM THAN I THOUGHT.

08:20.710 --> 08:22.000
OH, IS THAT GONNA BE A PROBLEM?

08:24.620 --> 08:26.829
NO.

08:26.830 --> 08:30.749
UNLESS, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE,
SOMEONE WANTS TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

08:30.750 --> 08:31.789
LIKE ME.

08:31.790 --> 08:33.539
OH, YEAH, YOU WANT
TO GO, NO PROBLEM.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.209
- YEAH, YOU MIND, GUYS?
- OKAY, SO WE'LL JUST... YUP.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.669
ON THE COUNT OF THREE,
WE'RE GOING STARBOARD.

08:36.670 --> 08:37.919
ON THREE. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

08:37.920 --> 08:38.999
OPPOSITE OF PORT.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.669
- STEADY. -OKAY, WHOA.
I'M NOT IN THE NAVY!

08:40.670 --> 08:42.079
I'M JUST... OKAY. OH, GOD.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.670
I'M JUST GONNA HEAD
OUT THE WINDOW.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.209
BURGERS. DOUGHNUTS. ICE CREAM.

08:50.210 --> 08:53.749
KIDS, DIETARY TEMPTATION
IS ON EVERY CORNER,

08:53.750 --> 08:54.959
BUT THERE'S GOOD NEWS.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.669
IT'S GETTING EASIER
TO EAT HEALTHIER.

08:57.670 --> 09:02.039
JUST MINUTES AGO, I BOUGHT
THIS BROCCOLI FUN PACK

09:02.040 --> 09:03.539
FROM YOUR SCHOOL'S
VENDING MACHINE.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.420
(kids groaning)

09:11.250 --> 09:13.999
MMM. MMM-MMM!

09:14.000 --> 09:17.579
THAT...

09:17.580 --> 09:19.580
YEAH. THAT IS THE STUFF.

09:23.580 --> 09:24.790
(coughing)

09:25.960 --> 09:27.669
(phone rings)

09:27.670 --> 09:29.039
YELLO.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.289
HANK, WHEN YOU SAID CAMPAIGNING
WILL TURN MY STOMACH,

09:32.290 --> 09:35.079
I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS BECAUSE OF ALL
THE BROCCOLI I WOULD HAVE TO EAT.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.289
DID YOU SWALLOW ANY OF IT?

09:37.290 --> 09:38.619
TRIED NOT TO.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.669
OKAY, LISTEN, MEL,

09:40.670 --> 09:44.539
THIS HEALTHY EATING THING IS GOING
TO BE GREAT FOR YOUR IMAGE.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.249
IT'S GONNA BE ALL OVER THE NEWS.

09:46.250 --> 09:50.039
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP IT UP UNTIL
WE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE YOUR CANDIDACY

09:50.040 --> 09:51.499
AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.079
CAN YOU DO THAT?

09:54.080 --> 09:55.709
YEAH. THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

09:55.710 --> 09:58.169
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,
CONGRESSWOMAN.

09:58.170 --> 09:59.749
OH, I WILL.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.040
GOOD, TASTY, YUMMY, NIGHT.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.209
- HEY.
- HEY.

10:07.210 --> 10:09.919
I HAD THE BEST DAY TELLING
KIDS ABOUT VEGETABLES.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.170
YOU KNOW, I ATE A WHOLE BUNCH OF
BROCCOLI, AND I BARELY GAGGED ONCE.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.499
I'M PROUD OF YOU, SWEETIE.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.999
LISTEN, YOU KNOW, HANK
MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT

10:17.000 --> 10:18.919
ABOUT ALL THOSE CRAZIES
COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK.

10:18.920 --> 10:19.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:19.960 --> 10:23.289
WELL, UM, LISTEN TO THIS TWEET.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.879
"LOVED SEEING MEL BURKE WOLF DOWN
A GREASY DOUBLE PIGGY BURGER

10:26.880 --> 10:29.079
"AFTER TELLING OUR KIDS WHAT
THEY CAN AND CAN'T EAT.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.750
"HASHTAG HYPOCRITE."

10:31.750 --> 10:33.379
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT, RIGHT?

10:33.380 --> 10:35.999
NO! I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE
MAKE UP THESE TOTAL LIES.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.669
I KNOW, THERE'S A BUNCH
OF LIARS OUT THERE.

10:37.670 --> 10:42.539
HOWEVER, UM, THERE'S A PICTURE OF YOU
APPEARING TO WALK INTO PIGGY BURGER.

10:42.540 --> 10:45.380
OH, YEAH, UM, I GOT AN ICED TEA.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.289
APPARENTLY, THE ICED
TEAS AT PIGGY BURGER

10:49.290 --> 10:52.420
LOOK REMARKABLY LIKE A TRIPLE
BACON CHILI CHEESEBURGER.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.539
I HAD A HARD DAY.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.459
BESIDES, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
LETTUCE ALL OVER IT.

10:58.460 --> 11:00.539
IT WAS PRACTICALLY A SALAD.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.789
UGH. BOY, I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.499
MAYBE FROM ALL THE SALAD?

11:04.500 --> 11:07.169
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? TWO
CAN TWEET AT THIS GAME.

11:07.170 --> 11:08.789
"YO, DENNIS BLAKELY.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.619
"DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING
BETTER TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE?"

11:11.620 --> 11:14.459
OKAY, GOOD. SO, HE STARTED IT,
YOU ENDED IT, NOW IT'S OVER.

11:14.460 --> 11:15.619
(phone dings)

11:15.620 --> 11:17.709
LOOK WHAT HE JUST WROTE!

11:17.710 --> 11:20.539
"AT LEAST I'M NOT TELLING KIDS TO EAT HEALTHY
WHILE I STUFF MY BITCH FACE WITH BURGERS.

"HASHTAG LYING SACK."

11:22.500 --> 11:24.379
(gasps)

11:24.380 --> 11:26.419
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, HONEY. HONEY, THIS
IS YOUR CHANCE TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.579
"WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU,
YOU HATEFUL LITTLE TROLL?"

11:29.580 --> 11:31.380
APPARENTLY, THE HIGH ROAD ISN'T
AS HIGH AS I THOUGHT IT WAS.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.829
OOF, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE
HAD THAT SECOND BURGER.

11:34.830 --> 11:37.539
I MEAN, ICED TEA.
I HAD A HARD DAY!

11:37.540 --> 11:39.380
SECOND BURGER?

11:42.170 --> 11:44.420
(music playing)

11:46.120 --> 11:47.290
(both laugh)

11:48.920 --> 11:52.379
THIS IS SO NICE, YOU KNOW, JUST
BEING HERE TOGETHER, ROOMIE.

11:52.380 --> 11:54.250
MM-HMM.

11:55.290 --> 11:59.329
COULD YOU MAYBE TURN THAT
DOWN A LITTLE, ROOMIE?

11:59.330 --> 12:00.380
SURE.

12:04.170 --> 12:05.419
DID YOU TURN IT DOWN?

12:05.420 --> 12:08.379
OH, WAY DOWN. LIKE, TWO CLICKS.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.380
COULD YOU MAYBE DO ONE MORE?

12:12.460 --> 12:14.379
THREE CLICKS?

12:14.380 --> 12:17.829
YOU KNOW, I'D PREFER IT BE WITHIN THE
AUDIBLE SPECTRUM OF HUMAN HEARING.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.460
I'M NOT A DOG.

12:20.830 --> 12:23.499
WELL, MAYBE, YOU COULD
WEAR HEADPHONES?

12:23.500 --> 12:26.379
OR, MAYBE, YOU COULD
WEAR EARPLUGS?

12:26.380 --> 12:30.580
OR, BETTER IDEA, YOU COULD LISTEN
TO MUSIC THAT DOESN'T SUCK.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.999
YOU KNOW, FRENCH RETRO POP
IS PRETTY IN RIGHT NOW.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.329
OH, IT'S IN?

12:36.330 --> 12:38.499
WELL, NOW I LIKE IT.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.249
GOOD! I'M SO GLAD.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.380
(music gets louder)

12:44.830 --> 12:47.919
IF YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, I
WAS BEING SARCASTIC.

12:47.920 --> 12:52.249
WELL, IT'S HARD TO TELL WHEN
EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS SARCASTIC.

12:52.250 --> 12:55.329
OKAY. WELL, LET'S TEST AND SEE IF YOU
CAN TELL WHEN I'M BEING SARCASTIC.

12:55.330 --> 12:57.039
I'M SO GLAD YOU MOVED IN.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.000
I'M SO GLAD TO BE HERE.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.169
YOU SURE THIS IS OKAY? I MEAN,
YOUR ROOM'S KINDA SMALL.

13:03.170 --> 13:04.379
YOU KIDDING?

13:04.380 --> 13:06.500
IN THE NAVY, THIS ROOM
WOULD SLEEP 38 GUYS.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.539
HEY, UM, DO YOU MIND IF
I LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC?

13:12.540 --> 13:14.539
YEAH, NO PROBLEM. I'M
JUST PLAYING GAMES.

13:14.540 --> 13:17.579
NOT MUCH ELSE TO DO UNTIL I
GET MY ASSIGNMENT ORDERS.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.209
WOW, LOOK AT THE
GRAPHICS ON THAT GAME.

13:20.210 --> 13:23.459
THAT'S THE MOST GORGEOUS WAR-TORN
BATTLEFIELD I'VE EVER SEEN.

13:23.460 --> 13:27.579
YOU SHOULD SEE THE WAY THE LIGHT HITS
THE ZOMBIES' BRAINS WHEN THEY EXPLODE.

13:27.580 --> 13:28.709
IT'S PURE POETRY.

13:28.710 --> 13:29.959
YOU WANNA PLAY?

13:29.960 --> 13:31.619
OH, YOU KNOW, VIDEO GAMES
AREN'T REALLY MY THING.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.419
OH, COME ON, SIT. SIT!

13:34.420 --> 13:36.249
OKAY. UM...

13:36.250 --> 13:37.959
- HIT X TO SHOOT.
- OKAY.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.169
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T HAVE,
LIKE, A KILLER INSTINCT.

13:40.170 --> 13:41.209
LOOK OUT, ZOMBIES!

13:41.210 --> 13:42.830
DIE! DIE! DIE!

13:44.120 --> 13:45.169
(chuckling)

13:45.170 --> 13:47.579
- THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME.
- YEAH, IT WAS.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.249
HEY, BEHIND YOU! THERE
ARE THREE MORE!

13:49.250 --> 13:51.379
DIE! DIE! DIE!

13:51.380 --> 13:52.919
OH.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.040
YEAH, THEIR BRAINS
DO KIND OF JUST...

13:57.460 --> 13:58.999
(phone dings)

13:59.000 --> 14:00.419
AND MY BOOK GOT
ANOTHER REJECTION.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.169
OH, I'M SORRY, JOE.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.419
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
I'M NOT WORRIED.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.419
EVERY NO BRINGS YOU
CLOSER TO A YES.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.539
YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT? I DID.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.119
YUP. IN MY BOOK.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.419
THAT NO ONE WANTS TO PUBLISH.

14:11.420 --> 14:13.459
REALLY?

14:13.460 --> 14:15.329
EVERY TIME HANK COMES OVER
HERE TO WORK WITH YOU,

14:15.330 --> 14:16.879
YOU GOT TO BRING OUT A
COPY OF THE 12 STEPS?

14:16.880 --> 14:18.039
- WELL, I JUST...
- (doorbell rings)

14:18.040 --> 14:19.619
RANDOMLY CHOSE A BOOK

14:19.620 --> 14:21.419
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WE READ.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.210
AND WE'RE SOBER.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.919
MEL, WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.040
OH, YEAH, HI, JOE.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.169
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

14:32.170 --> 14:34.289
City Councilperson Mel
Burke apparently thinks

14:34.290 --> 14:37.379
everyone of below-average
height is sub-human.

14:37.380 --> 14:40.419
I was tweeting Mel Burke
about her campaign,

14:40.420 --> 14:43.829
after all, I'm just a constituent
interacting with the woman

14:43.830 --> 14:45.670
who claims she wants
to represent me...

14:47.000 --> 14:49.170
and she called me
a little troll.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.579
WHY WOULD YOU CALL HIM THAT?

14:52.580 --> 14:55.459
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION FOR
JERKS ON THE INTERNET!

14:55.460 --> 14:57.749
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S MAKING
A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.959
I don't want to make
a big deal about it,

14:59.960 --> 15:02.039
but words hurt.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.079
OKAY, THIS ISN'T FATAL.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.379
WE JUST NEED TO GET OUT IN
FRONT OF IT RIGHT AWAY.

15:06.380 --> 15:07.669
WITH A PUBLIC APOLOGY.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.419
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
ACCEPT HIS APOLOGY.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.329
HE CALLED ME A BITCH.

15:11.330 --> 15:13.999
NO. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
GOING TO APOLOGIZE.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.540
APOLOGIZE FOR NO REASON?
WHAT AM I, HIS HUSBAND?

15:18.330 --> 15:21.250
I JUST WANNA SAY I'M SORRY FOR
EVERYTHING YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

15:27.170 --> 15:28.539
SURE YOU WANNA PUT
THAT SCOOP IN THERE?

15:28.540 --> 15:29.830
YES.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.290
NO.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.250
GOOD GOD, YOU'RE HARD TO READ.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.379
NO, I'M JUST SAYING
THAT, YOU KNOW,

15:38.380 --> 15:40.749
MEL'S HAVING THIS INTERNET GUY COME
OVER SO SHE CAN APOLOGIZE TO HIM,

15:40.750 --> 15:44.209
AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO PUT FRESH COFFEE
IN WITH YESTERDAY'S COFFEE...

15:44.210 --> 15:46.000
YOU KNOW, DOESN'T REALLY SOUND
LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.000
SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU WANT ME TO...
SCRUB THE POT?

15:51.120 --> 15:52.080
I LOVE IT WHEN I
DON'T HAVE TO ASK.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.209
AND I LOVE PAYING FOR
MY RENT IN CHORES

15:57.210 --> 15:59.290
AND MIND GAMES.

16:02.540 --> 16:03.920
HELLO, AUNT MEL.

16:05.290 --> 16:06.330
CHORE BOY.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.419
I'LL JUST SET THIS
SPONGE DOWN NOW.

16:09.420 --> 16:14.250
(gasps) I'M SO SORRY, WAS THAT TOO
LOUD FOR YOUR DAINTY LITTLE EARS?

16:16.670 --> 16:18.999
LIVING TOGETHER WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.209
HA! WHOEVER TOLD YOU THAT?

16:21.210 --> 16:22.749
WE COULDN'T EVEN MAKE
IT THROUGH ONE NIGHT,

16:22.750 --> 16:25.209
AND NOW, HE'S BEST BUDS WITH
HIS NEW ROOMMATE RYDER.

16:25.210 --> 16:28.459
OKAY, LENNOX, WHEN YOU'RE LIVING WITH SOMEONE,
YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.829
COMPROMISE? WITH ZANDER?

16:30.830 --> 16:32.919
WHY? I ALREADY WIN
ALL OF OUR FIGHTS.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.289
OKAY, WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT
WILLING TO COMPROMISE,

16:35.290 --> 16:37.039
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT HIM OUT.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.999
AND THERE'S GOOD NEWS THERE. RYDER'S
ROOM IS SMALLER THAN YOURS.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.119
YOU PUT RATS TOGETHER
IN A TINY SPACE,

16:41.120 --> 16:42.460
AND EVENTUALLY THEY
WILL EAT EACH OTHER.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.749
YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM
TO HAVE THEIR FIRST BIG FIGHT,

16:45.750 --> 16:47.789
THEN ZANDER WILL
COME CRAWLING BACK.

16:47.790 --> 16:49.919
THEY'RE SLEEPING HEAD-TO-TOE
IN THE SAME BED

16:49.920 --> 16:51.920
LIKE THE GRANDPARENTS
IN WILLY WONKA.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.749
AND ZANDER'S HAPPY.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.169
HOW DARE HE!

16:57.170 --> 16:58.960
I KNOW.

17:06.170 --> 17:07.120
(mutters) GO.

17:09.170 --> 17:10.619
IT IS SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.169
YEAH, WHATEVER.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.499
CAN I OFFER YOU A
PASTRY OR SOME COFFEE?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.329
YOU'RE OFFERING ME COFFEE?

17:16.330 --> 17:19.120
A SUBSTANCE FAMOUS FOR
STUNTING GROWTH? NICE.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.040
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.709
LOOK, WE'RE NOT PALS.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.249
I'M HERE FOR AN ON-AIR APOLOGY.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.039
AND IT WOULDN'T HURT IF YOU
MENTIONED MY DRY-CLEANING BUSINESS.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.209
DENNIS' LOW COST CLEANERS.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.079
OH, I GET IT.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.829
THE COSTS ARE LOW
'CAUSE YOU'RE S...

17:33.830 --> 17:36.249
SUCH A GREAT BUSINESSMAN.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.539
READY, COUNCILWOMAN?

17:37.540 --> 17:39.329
UH, YEAH. SHOULD I TAKE OFF
MY HEELS BECAUSE OF THE...

17:39.330 --> 17:40.709
YOU'LL BE SITTING.

17:40.710 --> 17:43.000
OH. SO MUCH BETTER.

17:45.670 --> 17:46.999
(clears throat)

17:47.000 --> 17:48.499
COUNCILWOMAN BURKE,

17:48.500 --> 17:51.959
BY NOW, THE GREATER TOLEDO AREA
KNOWS ALL ABOUT "TROLLGATE."

17:51.960 --> 17:54.169
SO, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO
SAY TO DENNIS BLAKELY?

17:54.170 --> 17:57.079
MR. BLAKELY, I JUST WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU FOR COMING OVER,

17:57.080 --> 18:01.079
AND ALLOWING ME, IN PERSON,
TO TELL YOU HOW DEEPLY S...

18:01.080 --> 18:02.749
(coughs)

18:02.750 --> 18:04.419
HOW DEEPLY...

18:04.420 --> 18:05.670
(coughs again)

18:07.460 --> 18:10.079
I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW DEEPLY SO...
(gags)

18:10.080 --> 18:12.749
SHE CAN'T EVEN SAY IT,
THE DAMN HEIGHTIST!

18:12.750 --> 18:15.120
I CAN DO IT.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.999
I AM SO...

18:18.000 --> 18:19.169
(retches)

18:19.170 --> 18:21.960
(vomiting)

18:24.170 --> 18:26.499
I AM SO SORRY.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.080
FOR CALLING ME A TROLL,
OR RUINING MY PANTS?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.579
DENNIS' LOW COST CLEANERS.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.670
I'LL MAKE SHORT
WORK OF THAT STAIN.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.579
HON, HERE.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.749
LOOK, BABE YOU'VE BEEN NAUSEOUS
EVERY DAY SINCE HANK TOLD YOU

18:44.750 --> 18:46.459
HOW STRESSFUL THIS CAMPAIGN
WAS GONNA BE, ALL RIGHT?

18:46.460 --> 18:48.169
YOU'RE HAVING A CLASSIC
PSYCHOSOMATIC REACTION.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.579
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING I'M NUTS?

18:49.580 --> 18:51.289
NO, I'M SAYING THAT
YOU'RE STRESSED OUT.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.329
I MEAN, WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION COULD THERE BE?

18:53.330 --> 18:56.079
COUNCILWOMAN, YOU MIGHT
TRY SOME CHAMOMILE TEA.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.170
THAT HELPED ME A LOT
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.460
I SUPPOSE THERE COULD BE
ONE OTHER EXPLANATION.

19:10.830 --> 19:12.209
Ryder: DUDE, THIS
STUFF IS EVERYWHERE!

19:12.210 --> 19:13.619
Zander: IT'S NOT EVERYWHERE.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.079
Ryder: IT'S IN MY CONTROLLER!

19:15.080 --> 19:16.209
Zander: YOU SAID I
COULD EAT IN HERE.

19:16.210 --> 19:17.709
Ryder: ORANGE DUST
IN THE BUTTONS.

19:17.710 --> 19:20.289
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE SET OFF SOME
KIND OF CHEESE PUFF BOMB.

19:20.290 --> 19:22.079
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, MAN.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.040
UNACCEPTABLE!

19:26.420 --> 19:28.579
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU WA...

19:28.580 --> 19:29.999
YOU WANT ME OUT?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.039
OVER SOME STUPID LITTLE FIGHT?
NO WAY.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.079
NO. THIS IS A TIME TO WORK
ON OUR CONFLICT RESOLUTION.

19:35.080 --> 19:39.999
IN THE NAVY, THEY DON'T WANT 141 MEN SHARING
A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE HATING ON EACH OTHER.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.499
SO, TIMES LIKE THIS, THEY HAVE
US LOOK FOR WHAT THEY CALL,

19:43.500 --> 19:44.999
"COMMONALITY OF INTEREST."

19:45.000 --> 19:46.919
Zander: OKAY, YOU MEAN, LIKE,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.879
YOU AND ME FIGURING OUT
HOW TO SHARE THIS SPACE

19:48.880 --> 19:50.289
WITHOUT GETTING ON
EACH OTHER'S NERVES?

19:50.290 --> 19:52.079
EXACTLY.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.169
SEE, I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU

19:53.170 --> 19:56.790
THAT THIS ROOM IS A "NO FOOD
WITH ORANGE DUST" ZONE.

19:57.960 --> 20:01.879
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THE DESTRUCTIVE
POWER OF CHEESY ORANGE DUST.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.289
SO, FROM NOW ON, I WILL EAT
MY PUFFS IN THE KITCHEN,

20:05.290 --> 20:08.250
AND I WILL THOROUGHLY VACUUM MYSELF
BEFORE STEPPING FOOT INTO YOUR ROOM.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.250
OUR ROOM.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.329
BUDS?

20:15.330 --> 20:16.919
BUDS.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.120
GET IN HERE.

20:19.670 --> 20:21.879
SO, THIS IS WHAT COMPROMISE
IS LIKE IN A RELATIONSHIP?

20:21.880 --> 20:23.539
FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

20:23.540 --> 20:24.959
NO.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.460
IT FEELS GREAT.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.539
(beeping)

20:31.540 --> 20:33.749
OKAY. IT'S TIME.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.750
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.829
OH MY GOD.

20:39.830 --> 20:40.919
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.459
- YOU'RE PREGNANT.
- WE'RE PREGNANT.

20:42.460 --> 20:45.710
ALL OF US ARE PREGNANT!

20:52.170 --> 20:53.749
WAIT.

20:53.750 --> 20:54.999
I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.080
I'M PREGNANT.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.749
WHAT DID YOU THINK
PREGNANT MEANT BEFORE?

21:00.750 --> 21:04.169
NO, I'M PREGNANT, AND I'M
RUNNING FOR CONGRESS!

21:04.170 --> 21:06.499
WHAT IS THIS GONNA
MEAN FOR MY CAMPAIGN?

21:06.500 --> 21:07.789
HONEY, LOOK, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

21:07.790 --> 21:08.790
LET'S JUST ENJOY
THIS MOMENT, OKAY?

21:08.791 --> 21:10.879
OH, BUT IT'S JUST... IT'S
SO MUCH ALL AT ONCE.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.580
- IT'D BE SO MUCH BETTER IF...
- YO, YO, YO, YO!

21:15.000 --> 21:17.209
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

21:17.210 --> 21:18.619
NO! I NEED WINE!

21:18.620 --> 21:20.919
ALL RIGHT, COMING
RIGHT UP, OKAY?

21:20.920 --> 21:22.750
IN NINE MONTHS.
