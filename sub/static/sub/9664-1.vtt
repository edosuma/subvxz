03:10.456 --> 03:12.390
Hang on a second.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.392
Ah, the Compleat Angler.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.893
Big day tomorrow.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.300
Hi.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.900
Hey, Cliffie, how you doing?

03:31.978 --> 03:33.912
- Gettin' ready for school tomorrow?
- Yeah.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.413
Listen, good luck.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.249
I told him, "Hector,

03:43.323 --> 03:46.087
"TV is a narcotic.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.593
"It drains away your manhood

03:48.661 --> 03:52.165
if you watch it all the time."

03:52.298 --> 03:53.663
It's a drug.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.166
Exactly.

03:55.234 --> 03:56.667
A drug.

03:56.736 --> 04:01.605
There he is, a young fellow,
only 67 years old,

04:01.674 --> 04:05.303
already his eyes are
turning into headlights.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.778
It got to where...

04:08.948 --> 04:13.009
I practically had to drag him to bed.

04:14.453 --> 04:17.387
Well, that's what busted us up.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.051
Oh, hey...

04:21.127 --> 04:24.358
these are the Dumpys from Cincinnati.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.421
Dunphys.

04:26.499 --> 04:29.991
He makes those cute "get well" cards.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.003
She writes the verses.

04:32.071 --> 04:35.268
You got any X-rated cards?

04:35.341 --> 04:37.866
Not as yet, Mrs. Peache.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.379
Oh.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.381
Say, that looks delicious.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.885
Why don't you squeeze a little shot

04:46.953 --> 04:50.389
of lemon in there...
a little zing to it.

04:52.124 --> 04:54.058
Live a little, huh?

04:57.964 --> 04:59.864
Now, where...
Oh, yeah.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.565
Everything is under control.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.069
Hi, Dad.

05:05.137 --> 05:09.005
She has no access to the room keys.

05:09.075 --> 05:12.511
I can't do that.
She's my mother.

05:12.578 --> 05:16.014
It was nothing more than
a misunderstanding.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.515
Mm-hmm.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.349
Griffith is not the manager
of this hotel.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.650
I am. Trust me, okay?

05:23.723 --> 05:26.453
405's done.
I'll finish 406 tomorrow.

05:26.525 --> 05:27.958
Tomorrow? When?

05:28.027 --> 05:29.460
After lunch.

05:29.528 --> 05:30.961
That's too late.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.463
You want miracles?

05:32.531 --> 05:34.362
Hold on.
Marty, wait.

05:34.433 --> 05:36.560
- She's not in the pump room.
- Oh, God.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.399
I can't be everywhere.
I'm on my break.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.735
- She's in the bar.
- Alone?

05:40.806 --> 05:44.037
I'm outta here.
I got a union meeting.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.442
I'll call you back, okay?

05:46.512 --> 05:47.945
Bye.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.447
Where is he?

05:57.189 --> 06:01.125
As usual, we're operating
like a well-oiled machine.

06:01.193 --> 06:03.127
Have time for dinner?

06:03.195 --> 06:05.129
Come on.
Yes, Griffith.

06:05.197 --> 06:08.064
Mr. Peache,
things are going badly.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.069
The fourth floor is a disaster.

06:11.137 --> 06:11.933
Mrs. Dunphy...

06:12.004 --> 06:15.565
alleges that her husband was
propositioned by an elderly lady.

06:15.641 --> 06:18.508
And we know who that was.

06:18.577 --> 06:21.068
Senator Byrum has had
his suite double-booked.

06:21.147 --> 06:24.583
Okay, I'll take care of
Mrs. Dunphy and the senator,

06:24.650 --> 06:27.585
and you take care
of the fourth floor.

06:29.155 --> 06:32.591
You, young man, still have to eat.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.092
I'll try and join you.
Okay?

06:37.496 --> 06:39.430
Hello. Hello, miss.

06:39.498 --> 06:41.432
Have you seen a...

06:41.500 --> 06:43.764
You wouldn't be Mrs. Dunphy?

06:43.836 --> 06:46.100
For crying out loud, you were
described so differently.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.003
This is your father?

07:00.186 --> 07:01.619
Bats!

07:01.687 --> 07:03.120
Bats!

07:06.692 --> 07:09.559
I'm sorry.
Did I scare you?

07:09.628 --> 07:11.562
No. I saw you.

07:11.630 --> 07:14.565
You did not, you little liar.

07:14.633 --> 07:17.067
Nobody suspects a bat attack.

07:17.136 --> 07:21.072
I saw it coming a mile off.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.573
No, no.

07:22.641 --> 07:25.075
Don't you strike a woman.

07:25.144 --> 07:28.079
Men think women want that.
They're wrong.

07:28.147 --> 07:31.082
Leave her before you strike her.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.084
Put that pillow down.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.585
That's it.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.217
Ow!

07:38.290 --> 07:41.418
Stop it.
All right, I quit.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.928
Oh, you dirty rotten kid.

07:43.996 --> 07:46.430
You never take my advice.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.933
Look what I got you.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.935
A brand-new notebook,

07:51.003 --> 07:52.937
a pack of paper,

07:53.005 --> 07:55.098
and, uh... pens

07:55.174 --> 07:57.608
and pencils and an eraser.

07:57.676 --> 08:00.611
I always loved opening day of school.

08:00.679 --> 08:04.115
I loved going in
the stationery stores.

08:04.183 --> 08:07.050
They smell so terrific.
Lumberyards, too.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.552
And bookstores.

08:08.621 --> 08:12.387
Yeah. Nothing smells
better than a new book.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.551
Mother!

08:14.627 --> 08:16.060
Mother.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.232
Mother...

08:28.974 --> 08:30.407
Mother.

08:33.645 --> 08:37.412
How did you know I was back there?

08:37.482 --> 08:40.816
A little heavy
on the Jungle Gardenia.

08:42.221 --> 08:46.681
Ooh, that smell lured
1,000 men into my clutches.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.192
Your clutches...

08:48.260 --> 08:51.696
is precisely the subject
of tonight's sermon.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.699
We've talked about it many times.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.702
I like the
"Thou shalt nots."

08:57.770 --> 09:00.204
I don't own this hotel.

09:00.272 --> 09:01.705
I manage it.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.709
Where would it be without you?

09:04.777 --> 09:06.642
With a new manager.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.647
Griffith watches me like a vulture.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.148
That greasy wimp.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.653
He says you tried to pick up

09:14.720 --> 09:16.654
some guy from Cincinnati.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.656
A married man, Mom.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.783
We were talking.
We had a few drinks.

09:20.860 --> 09:24.660
It was perfectly innocent.
His wife was there all the time.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.163
Okay.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.167
Where do you suggest we go

09:29.235 --> 09:31.795
when they kick us out of this hotel?

09:31.871 --> 09:34.169
Well, the old actors home.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.676
I'd be a resident.
You'd be a manager.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.176
Cliff'd be a busboy.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.803
I'll just retire.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.180
You're going to school
and acting like a student.

09:45.251 --> 09:49.244
I'll act like a hotel manager.
And, Mom?

09:49.321 --> 09:50.948
Yes, Larry.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.524
Try...

09:53.592 --> 09:56.993
for God's sake, to act your age.

09:57.062 --> 10:00.327
- Are you going to act your age?
- I'll try.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.492
I won't try. You try.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.228
Give 'em hell, Champ.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.735
Pick you up at 3:00.

11:13.805 --> 11:16.774
[No Audible Dialogue]

11:26.618 --> 11:29.086
[Bell Rings]

11:36.895 --> 11:40.058
Excuse me.
Is 235 that way?

11:40.132 --> 11:41.565
[Reply Inaudible]

11:49.174 --> 11:51.802
[Students Chattering]

12:01.820 --> 12:03.253
Good morning.

12:03.321 --> 12:06.256
Would you please find a seat?

12:07.492 --> 12:09.892
Hey, I'm sitting there.

12:09.961 --> 12:11.792
Sorry.

12:11.863 --> 12:15.697
Hello! Would you please find a seat?

12:15.767 --> 12:17.735
Find one you like.

12:17.803 --> 12:21.705
It will be your seat
the entire semester.

12:23.441 --> 12:25.068
Uh, that's saved.

12:27.345 --> 12:31.213
Would the young man in the blue shirt

12:31.283 --> 12:34.719
find a seat and sit in it?

12:36.121 --> 12:37.554
Is this saved?

12:43.295 --> 12:45.229
Feel under the desk.

12:47.632 --> 12:50.226
You've got gum dating back
to Neanderthal times.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.234
Really?

12:51.303 --> 12:54.966
The gum's not the worst.
The boogers freak me out.

12:56.208 --> 12:59.644
You get hepatitis
from the fresh ones.

13:04.382 --> 13:07.180
Shelley, want to go out tonight?

13:07.252 --> 13:08.685
Ask Moody.

13:11.256 --> 13:12.086
Who's the new kid?

13:12.157 --> 13:13.749
I don't know.
He's kind of little.

13:13.825 --> 13:16.817
- Ask where he's from.
- You ask him.

13:16.895 --> 13:20.763
Weren't you in
Mr. Sanford's class last year?

13:20.832 --> 13:22.265
No. I'm new.

13:22.334 --> 13:25.633
- My mistake. He is new.
- [Clattering]

13:31.509 --> 13:34.945
Ladies and degenerates, here's Moody!

13:35.013 --> 13:37.447
Don't applaud.
Just throw money.

13:40.518 --> 13:41.951
Aww.

13:44.756 --> 13:48.385
I'm sure we're all thrilled
to have Mr. Moody among us

13:48.460 --> 13:53.056
as we begin this great adventure
known as your sophomore year.

13:55.033 --> 13:58.230
I saved a seat for you.

13:58.303 --> 14:01.739
Thanks a lot.
Willie, take this seat.

14:03.041 --> 14:06.408
You grew up over the summer, baby.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.747
Where did you get this hair?

14:10.815 --> 14:14.046
- K-mart.
- Heh heh heh. "K-mart."

14:14.119 --> 14:15.552
What's so funny?

14:15.620 --> 14:18.589
Mr. Moody, please find a seat.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.421
This sucker swiped it from me.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.690
- I was here first.
- Bullshit.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.196
If you can't find a seat back here,

14:26.264 --> 14:28.255
I'd be glad to have you
come sit up front with me.

14:31.236 --> 14:36.640
Alan Blumenthal.
Cyndie Rush.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.074
Move over to that seat.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.203
Ricky Linderman...

14:41.279 --> 14:45.716
Does anybody know if
Ricky Linderman is in school?

14:45.784 --> 14:48.776
I hope not.
Who wants him?

14:50.822 --> 14:52.619
Who's Linderman?

14:52.691 --> 14:55.683
No one, just the local mass murderer.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.197
Does anybody know if
Ricky Linderman is in school or not?

15:00.265 --> 15:03.132
Probably in New York climbing
the Empire State building.

15:03.201 --> 15:05.328
Thank you, Mr. Moody.

15:06.771 --> 15:08.170
Clifford...

15:08.239 --> 15:10.969
P-E-A-C-H-E.

15:11.042 --> 15:14.569
- Clifford, is that "Peach" or "Peachy"?
- "Peach."

15:15.780 --> 15:18.044
Knew he was a fruit.
[Chuckles]

15:18.116 --> 15:21.085
What did you say, Melvin?

15:21.152 --> 15:23.086
- Melvin?
- Melvin?

15:23.154 --> 15:26.851
I don't go by that no more, Clarice.

15:26.925 --> 15:30.361
Fair enough, you call me Ms. Jump.

15:30.428 --> 15:33.420
What shall we call you?

15:34.499 --> 15:35.796
M. Big M.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.664
I like that.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.363
Is that "B.M." for short?

15:41.106 --> 15:43.540
That kid's gonna get it.

15:43.608 --> 15:46.099
You've got nerve, even if
you're not gonna live long.

15:49.914 --> 15:53.577
You and me, we're gonna have
a little talk after school.

15:53.651 --> 15:54.583
Right?

15:55.653 --> 15:58.747
Right? Huh?

16:00.658 --> 16:04.253
You know that was so dumb
what you said to Moody.

16:04.329 --> 16:06.320
I never saw anybody
put him down before.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.765
- I hope you get away with it.
- Hold this, will you?

16:09.834 --> 16:13.770
Don't let him catch you in the
halls alone, or on the stairs either.

16:13.838 --> 16:16.272
Hold it over the bowl.

16:16.341 --> 16:18.775
Or especially in the bathrooms.

16:18.843 --> 16:21.277
I never go to the bathroom here,
if I can help it.

16:21.346 --> 16:24.782
- What do you do?
- Hold it in.

16:24.849 --> 16:26.783
Stay away from liquids.

16:26.851 --> 16:29.786
- That's ridiculous.
- You think so?

16:29.854 --> 16:34.120
They say one kid got thrown out
a window. He's a vegetable now.

16:34.192 --> 16:37.787
- That's dumb. Who told you that?
- Plenty of people.

16:37.862 --> 16:42.424
Another guy had his eye kicked out.
Total gross-out.

16:42.500 --> 16:46.300
- Never found the eyeball either.
- How are we doing here?

16:46.371 --> 16:48.305
What do we got?

16:48.373 --> 16:51.809
- You've done this before.
- Yeah.

16:54.779 --> 16:57.873
- Did Moody do that?
- What?

16:57.949 --> 17:00.383
Kick the guy's eye out.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.886
I'm not saying he did,
and I'm not saying he didn't.

17:02.954 --> 17:06.856
But you're better off
paying him protection money.

17:06.925 --> 17:10.291
- You pay Moody protection?
- Shh!

17:10.361 --> 17:13.022
You better believe it.
Lots of kids do.

17:13.098 --> 17:17.228
He takes their lunch money every day.
Now I'm brown-baggin' it.

17:17.301 --> 17:20.362
Now he claims he's gonna
take my bus fare.

17:20.438 --> 17:22.571
I don't think you shouldn't let him
get away with it.

17:22.640 --> 17:26.205
I know,
but I'm addicted to breathing.

17:27.412 --> 17:30.074
[Bell Rings]

17:30.148 --> 17:31.581
Let's go.

18:17.295 --> 18:18.728
[Horn Honks]

18:41.019 --> 18:43.453
Lock up in 15 minutes.

18:51.529 --> 18:55.021
There's a little party after school,

Oh, hey, how you doing?

58:23.832 --> 58:27.928
I'm looking for a 350 cylinder.

58:28.003 --> 58:29.197
- You got one?
- No, I don't.

58:29.271 --> 58:32.434
- You sure?
- Nope. Sorry.

58:43.051 --> 58:44.985
[Linderman] How about your mom?

58:45.053 --> 58:49.319
[Clifford]
She died in a car accident.

58:49.391 --> 58:52.485
- That's too bad.
- My grandmother moved in with us.

58:52.561 --> 58:54.194
She's like no one
I've ever seen before.

58:54.262 --> 58:58.499
She's really old,
but she acts like a kid.

58:58.567 --> 59:00.501
She gets...

59:00.569 --> 59:02.002
a little drunk.

59:02.070 --> 59:03.503
Picks up guys.

59:03.572 --> 59:06.507
- You're kidding.
- No.

59:06.575 --> 59:09.510
- Sounds great.
- She is, really.

59:09.578 --> 59:15.016
We gotta keep an eye on her
'cause she gets into things.

59:16.585 --> 59:20.521
Maybe she's afraid
of being old and dying.

59:20.589 --> 59:25.026
No, I think she's afraid
of not being alive.

59:33.034 --> 59:35.468
My dad had one of those.

59:35.537 --> 59:37.971
It looked like that then.

59:38.039 --> 59:41.475
- What does he do?
- Watches TV.

59:50.886 --> 59:52.319
How's this?

59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.493
Almost.

01:00:23.418 --> 01:00:25.511
He was only nine.

01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:29.523
I practically raised him
since he was two.

01:00:31.092 --> 01:00:33.026
He'd drive you crazy.

01:00:33.094 --> 01:00:35.528
Tell him to sit down,

01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:37.030
he'd stand up.

01:00:37.098 --> 01:00:40.033
Tell him to do his homework,

01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:42.535
he'd read a comic book.

01:00:48.443 --> 01:00:51.344
Couldn't eat food
without spitting it at you.

01:00:53.181 --> 01:00:55.115
A real shoplifter, too.

01:00:55.183 --> 01:00:57.117
Go through a store,

01:00:57.185 --> 01:01:01.622
half of it would wind up
in his pocket.

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.352
He was a good kid.

01:01:04.426 --> 01:01:06.360
A real handful, though.

01:01:11.366 --> 01:01:13.300
Poor little guy.

01:01:15.036 --> 01:01:16.469
Poor little guy.

01:01:51.339 --> 01:01:53.330
[No Audible Dialogue]

01:03:10.485 --> 01:03:12.578
That's her, Mr. Dobbs.

01:03:16.191 --> 01:03:17.920
I got to go.

01:03:19.994 --> 01:03:24.021
Hello, Mrs. Peache.
I'd like you to meet Mr. Dobbs,

01:03:24.099 --> 01:03:26.033
chief of hotel operations.

01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:29.468
- How do you do?
- Hiya, good-looking!

01:03:29.537 --> 01:03:32.973
Griffith has been telling me
a great deal about you.

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:35.976
Has he?
Well, um...

01:03:36.044 --> 01:03:39.480
Uh, sit down.
Have a little drink.

01:03:39.547 --> 01:03:41.481
They don't charge me.

01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:43.983
You know what I mean?

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:55.495
This is really the life.

01:03:55.563 --> 01:03:57.497
You know, it's interesting.

01:03:57.565 --> 01:04:01.501
I must have met
about a million people.

01:04:01.569 --> 01:04:03.799
Not many kids.
Mostly adults.

01:04:03.872 --> 01:04:06.841
Anytime you want to trade,
it's okay with me.

01:04:06.908 --> 01:04:10.810
Some view.
Is this good for stargazing?

01:04:10.879 --> 01:04:12.437
Uh...

01:04:14.482 --> 01:04:15.915
stars...

01:04:15.984 --> 01:04:17.918
the, uh, moon...

01:04:17.986 --> 01:04:19.715
and, uh...

01:04:19.787 --> 01:04:21.254
other heavenly bodies.

01:04:25.593 --> 01:04:27.026
All right.

01:04:27.095 --> 01:04:29.427
What time is it?

01:04:29.497 --> 01:04:30.964
About 7:00.

01:04:31.032 --> 01:04:33.466
That's Linda over there.

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:41.976
I trust your stay here
was a pleasant one.

01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:43.977
Very pleasant.

01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:46.980
And the room was all right?

01:04:47.048 --> 01:04:48.743
Perfect.

01:04:48.816 --> 01:04:51.478
And the service was...

01:04:51.553 --> 01:04:53.248
adequate?

01:04:53.321 --> 01:04:55.619
More than adequate.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.393
Thank you.

01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:01.928
You're welcome.

01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:04.328
When will you visit next?

01:05:04.399 --> 01:05:06.128
Friday.

01:05:07.802 --> 01:05:09.736
Well, I think we can accommodate you.

01:05:09.804 --> 01:05:12.034
I certainly hope so.

01:05:12.106 --> 01:05:13.630
Dad...

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:16.370
So have a very safe flight.

01:05:16.444 --> 01:05:18.309
And your key?

01:05:18.379 --> 01:05:20.404
You have it, Peachy.

01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:21.914
Of course.

01:05:21.983 --> 01:05:24.543
We're talking a two-day job
on the air conditioning.

01:05:24.619 --> 01:05:27.447
If it gets hotter in here we're going
to have some miserable customers.

01:05:27.522 --> 01:05:31.190
Well, what if we work
through the night?

01:05:31.259 --> 01:05:33.727
- Night?
- So we'll just have one day without it.

01:05:33.795 --> 01:05:36.696
- Night?
- Night. I'd appreciate it.

01:05:36.764 --> 01:05:41.064
- [Phone Ringing]
- Peache here. Thank you.

01:05:41.135 --> 01:05:42.568
Peache here.

01:05:42.637 --> 01:05:44.070
My mother?

01:05:44.138 --> 01:05:45.901
Oh, no.

01:05:45.974 --> 01:05:47.407
Where?

01:05:47.475 --> 01:05:49.568
How serious is it?

01:05:58.019 --> 01:05:59.452
Mother?

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.953
Are you...

01:06:01.022 --> 01:06:02.956
Just don't get excited.

01:06:03.024 --> 01:06:04.457
He's all right.

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:06.584
Didn't know his limitations.

01:06:06.661 --> 01:06:10.597
I warned him, but he kept saying
he was an animal.

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:14.100
Give me this.

01:06:14.168 --> 01:06:17.602
Do you know who this is?

01:06:18.972 --> 01:06:22.908
Your goose is really
cooked this time, Peache.

01:06:22.976 --> 01:06:24.910
She's finally done it.

01:06:24.978 --> 01:06:26.411
Griffith...

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.210
will you stop hovering over me?

01:06:29.283 --> 01:06:31.217
Get away from me.

01:06:31.285 --> 01:06:34.220
I'm just getting my second wind.

01:06:34.288 --> 01:06:37.724
You can really dance, sweetheart.

01:06:37.791 --> 01:06:40.225
You're not so bad yourself, Dobbsy,

01:06:40.294 --> 01:06:43.229
just a little out of shape.

01:06:43.297 --> 01:06:49.236
I haven't danced or had
a good time for ever so long.

01:06:49.303 --> 01:06:51.669
- Sir...
- Get away!

01:06:51.739 --> 01:06:53.673
Can I see you for a second?

01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:56.437
Griffith, sit down.

01:06:59.146 --> 01:07:01.740
They're getting along so well.

01:07:01.815 --> 01:07:04.579
Why not check
on tomorrow's reservations?

01:07:04.651 --> 01:07:06.084
Better yet,

01:07:06.153 --> 01:07:09.645
why not make
some reservations for yourself

01:07:09.723 --> 01:07:13.659
at some hotel where
you'll soak your feet...

01:07:13.727 --> 01:07:16.662
- after a hard day of job hunting.
- But, I...

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:18.891
Don't worry about us.

01:07:24.505 --> 01:07:26.439
Want a job, Cliffie?

01:07:26.507 --> 01:07:30.204
Now, you just go get a little rest

01:07:30.277 --> 01:07:34.543
'cause we got a long night
ahead of us.

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:36.048
All right.

01:07:36.116 --> 01:07:39.051
You be here in an hour,

01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:41.713
or I'll come after you.

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:47.056
Room 735, if I'm not right here.

01:07:47.127 --> 01:07:51.928
Peache, you run
a nice lively hotel here.

01:07:51.999 --> 01:07:53.432
Thank you.

01:07:55.636 --> 01:07:56.967
Are you Linderman?

01:07:58.672 --> 01:08:02.802
Would you care to
trip the light fantastic?

01:08:02.876 --> 01:08:04.434
Mother. No.

01:08:06.313 --> 01:08:09.248
Aw, let's go eat.

01:08:16.657 --> 01:08:18.750
Go like this.

01:08:28.167 --> 01:08:30.693
Drop the bouquet.

01:08:32.104 --> 01:08:34.538
Hey.

01:08:34.608 --> 01:08:36.542
Hey, terrific heart line.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:39.636
You got a lot of girlfriends?

01:08:39.712 --> 01:08:42.307
- No, ma'am.
- Heh heh.

01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:46.546
I'm talking in the future, smart guy.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:52.559
You're also very
intellectually inclined.

01:08:52.626 --> 01:08:55.560
Think that's in the future, too.

01:08:55.629 --> 01:08:58.564
I must be right about something.

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:01.430
You sure this is your hand?

01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:02.991
Wish I could deny it.

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:04.970
What happened to your wrist?

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:06.595
Nothing.

01:09:06.673 --> 01:09:08.106
Accident.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:11.402
Let me finish.

01:09:13.647 --> 01:09:15.581
Open up, Ricky.

01:09:15.649 --> 01:09:17.582
You're among friends.

01:09:18.652 --> 01:09:21.086
You're among friends.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:38.037
I see a long life line.

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:40.403
Very good.

01:09:40.474 --> 01:09:44.035
Very valuable.

01:09:49.883 --> 01:09:51.407
You're going to live
for 10 more years.

01:09:51.484 --> 01:09:54.545
Then you're going to snuff it.

01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:56.555
Mine's broken in half.

01:09:56.623 --> 01:09:58.056
- Is it?
- Yeah.

01:09:58.125 --> 01:09:59.956
Ooh!
You're going to die.

01:10:00.027 --> 01:10:03.463
These are your
need-for-affection lines.

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:05.464
You don't have any.

01:10:05.532 --> 01:10:06.965
Look like wrinkles.

01:10:07.034 --> 01:10:09.468
He's a sex maniac, here.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.733
Mine says, "love me."

01:10:15.809 --> 01:10:17.572
What are you trying...

01:10:20.147 --> 01:10:23.412
What does a double-jointed
thumb mean?

01:10:25.852 --> 01:10:28.787
I've been looking for you guys.

01:10:28.855 --> 01:10:32.791
I've got someone I want you to meet.

01:10:38.198 --> 01:10:40.325
Clifford, this is Mike.

01:10:52.746 --> 01:10:56.182
Ricky, this is Mike.

01:10:58.251 --> 01:10:59.912
He's my bodyguard.

01:11:07.094 --> 01:11:09.528
What do you say, pal?

01:11:25.779 --> 01:11:29.044
Moody tells me
you're a tough guy, huh?

01:11:29.116 --> 01:11:30.845
You're a real killer.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:32.578
Is that right?

01:11:32.652 --> 01:11:34.586
You beat up kids?

01:11:36.123 --> 01:11:38.057
Rape old ladies?

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:39.717
Is that right?

01:11:41.128 --> 01:11:43.028
Huh?

01:11:44.364 --> 01:11:46.924
I heard you even killed
your own brother.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.934
Got away with it too, I heard.

01:11:49.002 --> 01:11:53.439
- That's bullshit.
- Is it bullshit, huh, Rick?

01:11:53.507 --> 01:11:55.441
Huh? Huh?

01:11:55.509 --> 01:11:58.945
Is it bullshit?

01:12:03.283 --> 01:12:04.511
[Chuckles]

01:12:05.919 --> 01:12:08.285
Hey, killer, why you on your knees?

01:12:09.489 --> 01:12:11.753
You queer or something?
Huh?

01:12:11.825 --> 01:12:14.191
Come on. Get up.

01:12:15.729 --> 01:12:17.162
Huh?

01:12:24.237 --> 01:12:26.671
You going to hurt me?

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.674
You really think
you're gonna hurt me?

01:12:28.742 --> 01:12:30.334
Huh?

01:12:31.745 --> 01:12:33.110
Huh?

01:12:35.682 --> 01:12:38.116
You're not so tough.

01:12:38.185 --> 01:12:41.120
Thought you said this guy is tough.

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:45.323
Yeah, we'll see, huh?

01:12:46.393 --> 01:12:47.826
Yeah.

01:12:49.396 --> 01:12:51.330
What is this here?

01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:54.332
What is that?

01:12:54.401 --> 01:12:57.336
That chain's gonna make you tough?

01:13:01.908 --> 01:13:04.843
Tough magazine, huh?
Hey, he reads.

01:13:05.545 --> 01:13:07.137
Got an education.

01:13:10.016 --> 01:13:12.712
Huh?
You're not so tough.

01:13:12.786 --> 01:13:15.550
You're not so tough, are you?

01:13:15.622 --> 01:13:19.285
Huh? Huh?

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.793
Huh?

01:13:21.862 --> 01:13:23.796
You're not so tough.

01:13:38.745 --> 01:13:40.178
Come on.

01:13:40.247 --> 01:13:41.680
Come on.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:48.187
Come on with it.
Show me what you got.

01:13:52.759 --> 01:13:54.693
Yeah.
Real winner, huh?

01:13:54.761 --> 01:13:56.194
A real menace.

01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:02.767
Why don't you go kick his ass?

01:14:20.119 --> 01:14:21.780
Hey, killer.

01:14:21.855 --> 01:14:23.220
Where are you going?

01:14:23.289 --> 01:14:25.655
Is this your tough bike?

01:14:25.725 --> 01:14:27.317
Huh?

01:14:27.393 --> 01:14:28.860
This your tough bike?

01:14:28.928 --> 01:14:31.863
Don't look so tough to me.

01:14:39.739 --> 01:14:41.934
Think I'm tough enough to ride this?

01:14:42.008 --> 01:14:43.339
Huh?

01:14:43.409 --> 01:14:46.970
Come on. Get up.
I think I want to ride it.

01:14:47.046 --> 01:14:48.980
I said, get up!

01:14:53.386 --> 01:14:56.150
Let's see how tough this bike is.

01:14:57.724 --> 01:14:59.157
Hey, don't!

01:15:00.894 --> 01:15:02.452
Let me go!

01:15:16.409 --> 01:15:19.845
Moody, you said this guy was bad.

01:15:19.913 --> 01:15:23.076
Don't look so bad to me.

01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:24.377
Don't!

01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:28.614
- What's it take to get him going?
- Get up, man!

01:15:28.688 --> 01:15:30.781
Leave him alone.

01:15:30.857 --> 01:15:32.290
Hey, this is a drag.

01:15:32.358 --> 01:15:34.724
Call me when you really need me.

01:15:34.794 --> 01:15:36.557
I like to earn my money.

01:15:39.732 --> 01:15:42.895
Want me to kick your ass?

01:15:42.969 --> 01:15:45.369
Yes or no?

01:15:48.441 --> 01:15:50.807
Yeah, he wants me to kick his ass.

01:15:50.877 --> 01:15:52.640
Yeah, he wants me to kick his...

01:16:08.928 --> 01:16:11.019
What are you doing, Moody?
Don't. Put the bike back.

01:16:11.097 --> 01:16:13.659
Moody, don't do that.

01:16:13.733 --> 01:16:15.564
Moody, don't! Moody!

01:16:18.304 --> 01:16:19.828
Hey, yeah! Yeah!

01:16:51.637 --> 01:16:52.899
Are you okay?

01:16:54.207 --> 01:16:56.198
Why didn't you fight?

01:17:01.714 --> 01:17:02.840
Where are you going?

01:17:04.951 --> 01:17:06.179
Come on, where are you going?

01:18:03.142 --> 01:18:05.337
Anyone there?

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.211
Linderman?

01:18:46.486 --> 01:18:48.613
Hi. Is Ricky home?

01:18:48.688 --> 01:18:50.781
No. Who are you?

01:18:50.857 --> 01:18:53.291
I'm a friend from school.

01:18:53.359 --> 01:18:57.295
He was supposed to be home hours ago.

01:18:57.363 --> 01:18:59.797
What's your name?

01:18:59.866 --> 01:19:02.960
- Clifford.
- If you see him,

01:19:03.035 --> 01:19:05.970
tell him he should get home.

01:19:06.038 --> 01:19:07.130
Okay.

01:20:07.533 --> 01:20:08.557
Hey.

01:20:11.204 --> 01:20:14.037
How did you get up here?

01:20:14.106 --> 01:20:16.870
I need some money.

01:20:16.943 --> 01:20:19.810
Where were you?
I looked everywhere for you.

01:20:19.879 --> 01:20:21.972
You got any money?

01:20:22.048 --> 01:20:24.983
Come on.
Give me some money.

01:20:32.058 --> 01:20:34.993
Six bucks is all I got.

01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:42.932
Thanks, Cliff.
You're a good kid.

01:20:43.002 --> 01:20:44.902
Oh, well, that's great.

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.235
"Give me money. Thanks, bye."
That's real class.

01:20:52.078 --> 01:20:53.204
Where are you going?

01:21:01.153 --> 01:21:02.245
Linderman!

01:21:09.161 --> 01:21:10.253
Linderman!

01:21:41.861 --> 01:21:43.294
Wait up!

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.132
Linderman!

01:21:56.042 --> 01:21:57.134
Linderman.

01:22:15.728 --> 01:22:17.662
Wait up, damn it!

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:28.506
- Slow down, will you?
- Go home, Clifford.

01:22:28.574 --> 01:22:32.510
You got a nice place, a nice family.
Just leave me alone.

01:22:32.578 --> 01:22:35.513
- It's the fight, isn't it?
- I couldn't fight. So what?

01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:40.109
I never wanted to be anyone's damned
bodyguard, anyway. I told you that.

01:22:40.185 --> 01:22:41.880
It's on account of your brother.

01:22:41.954 --> 01:22:44.246
You can't fight because of
what happened to your brother.

01:22:44.322 --> 01:22:46.591
- That's it, isn't it?
- What do you know?

01:22:46.659 --> 01:22:48.786
It's a lousy excuse.
It's nothing, Linderman.

01:22:48.861 --> 01:22:50.954
Shut up!

01:22:52.731 --> 01:22:56.132
You haven't talked for over a year.

01:22:56.201 --> 01:22:58.426
- You walk like an ape for nothing.
- Shut up, Clifford!

01:22:58.503 --> 01:23:01.039
You build a bike to run away
for no reason, to go nowhere.

01:23:01.107 --> 01:23:02.796
And let some jerk
throw it into the lake.

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:03.807
Shut up!

01:23:03.876 --> 01:23:06.071
All because of something
you had nothing to do with.

01:23:06.145 --> 01:23:08.477
I mean, anybody
could've found your brother.

01:23:08.547 --> 01:23:10.139
It happened to be you.

01:23:10.215 --> 01:23:13.150
Shut up!
I didn't find him!

01:23:13.218 --> 01:23:15.277
I killed him!

01:23:15.988 --> 01:23:17.421
I shot him!

01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:21.691
Jesus.

01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:29.600
We were home alone.

01:23:29.668 --> 01:23:31.101
We were playing with my dad's gun.

01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:36.107
I was showing off
like a goddamn fool.

01:23:38.010 --> 01:23:40.444
He wanted to hold it.

01:23:40.512 --> 01:23:43.379
I said you're not allowed to.

01:23:43.449 --> 01:23:46.384
He grabbed it, and it fired.

01:23:47.619 --> 01:23:52.056
My God, I was laughing
when it went off.

01:23:55.294 --> 01:23:59.731
Blood gushed out of the side of
his head, and he didn't even know it.

01:24:05.637 --> 01:24:08.071
Know what he worried about?

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:12.076
That when Dad got home,
he'd get spanked.

01:24:15.314 --> 01:24:18.249
The last thing he said to me,

01:24:18.317 --> 01:24:22.549
he said, "You're gonna have
to take the blame for this one."

01:24:22.621 --> 01:24:24.248
I couldn't even do that right.

01:24:24.323 --> 01:24:27.759
I lied.
I put the gun in his hand

01:24:27.826 --> 01:24:31.091
and said I found him that way.

01:24:32.164 --> 01:24:33.597
Damn it.

01:24:40.005 --> 01:24:42.371
I never told anyone before.

01:24:55.788 --> 01:24:59.224
It wasn't your fault. You didn't mean
for it to happen.

01:25:01.794 --> 01:25:05.730
I'm sorry, Clifford.
I know you mean well.

01:25:05.798 --> 01:25:10.235
I let everybody down.
It's the way I am.

01:25:12.871 --> 01:25:14.896
Go home, Clifford.

01:25:45.304 --> 01:25:46.396
Hey.

01:25:47.472 --> 01:25:48.905
Where's the funeral?

01:25:49.975 --> 01:25:52.409
It can't be that bad.

01:25:52.477 --> 01:25:54.411
It's worse than ever.

01:25:54.479 --> 01:25:56.913
They took my bus fare.

01:25:56.982 --> 01:25:59.542
They flushed my lunch down the john.

01:25:59.618 --> 01:26:02.917
They called my mother names
I never even heard of.

01:26:02.988 --> 01:26:07.254
I'm going to quit school.
I'll never graduate anyway.

01:26:07.326 --> 01:26:10.693
- Where are you going?
- Home, I guess.

01:26:10.762 --> 01:26:12.730
Come on.
I'll buy you both a drink.

01:26:12.798 --> 01:26:16.734
- He might have tried calling.
- He'll be back.

01:26:16.802 --> 01:26:19.236
- He just needs time to think.
- Hope you're right.

01:26:19.304 --> 01:26:23.741
I'm always right.
That's what you'll learn about me.

01:26:23.809 --> 01:26:28.246
Someday you'll say, "Shelley, darling,
you're always right."

01:26:30.983 --> 01:26:33.918
Hey, look. Over there.
It's Linderman.

01:27:00.612 --> 01:27:04.548
Did you get that
out of there yourself?

01:27:04.616 --> 01:27:06.550
I know.
Dumb question.

01:27:07.786 --> 01:27:09.845
I was really scared.

01:27:13.292 --> 01:27:14.953
I can cheat, can't I?

01:27:15.027 --> 01:27:16.927
It's only a game.
Go ahead.

01:27:22.801 --> 01:27:27.238
Hey, where did you guys find my bike?
You been fishing?

01:27:30.075 --> 01:27:31.906
Oh, no.

01:27:32.978 --> 01:27:34.912
Thanks. I'll take it now.

01:27:44.256 --> 01:27:45.689
Hey, Mike.

01:27:47.826 --> 01:27:49.225
Moody, you're a real bastard.

01:27:58.036 --> 01:28:03.338
Linderman, you picking
on Moody again? Huh?

01:28:03.408 --> 01:28:05.841
- You're really beginning to annoy me.
- Look.

01:28:05.911 --> 01:28:07.243
Just don't give us any trouble.

01:28:07.312 --> 01:28:08.745
- Enough is enough.
- Get out!

01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:15.085
You got three seconds
to make your split.

01:28:15.153 --> 01:28:16.586
Now get.

01:28:21.159 --> 01:28:22.592
Uh-uh.

01:28:23.662 --> 01:28:27.257
- Without the bike.
- [Moody Chuckles]

01:28:27.332 --> 01:28:28.765
It's Moody's now.

01:28:32.838 --> 01:28:34.169
One...

01:28:38.343 --> 01:28:43.110
- two...
- I tell you, some guys never learn.

01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:51.054
Okay. Take it.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.895
Ahhhh!

01:29:03.802 --> 01:29:05.736
Get on him, Mike!

01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:12.067
Okay. Okay.

01:29:13.311 --> 01:29:14.744
Come on, Mike.

01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:19.583
Come on.

01:29:25.891 --> 01:29:27.483
Come on, Ricky.
Come on.

01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:13.194
Damn you, Moody!

01:30:50.275 --> 01:30:51.799
Moody?

01:31:04.456 --> 01:31:07.983
Get up.
Get up.

01:31:08.059 --> 01:31:10.357
Slow down.
Slow down.

01:31:10.428 --> 01:31:13.989
- Cover up.
- Come on, man.

01:31:14.065 --> 01:31:15.999
Get him.

01:31:23.642 --> 01:31:25.200
Come on, get him!

01:31:25.276 --> 01:31:26.368
Get him!

01:31:39.824 --> 01:31:42.258
Come on!
Hit him, kid!

01:31:49.768 --> 01:31:52.066
Come on. You want
your ass kicked. Come on!

01:31:52.137 --> 01:31:53.729
Come on, you faggot.
Come on, wimp.

01:31:54.939 --> 01:31:56.566
Go for his nose.

01:31:56.641 --> 01:32:00.407
Thanks. You're a wonderful
human being. You know that?

01:32:00.478 --> 01:32:02.776
You need your damn bodyguard?
Come on!

01:32:02.847 --> 01:32:06.044
Get him.

01:32:26.504 --> 01:32:28.495
Clifford, get him in the nose.

01:32:34.646 --> 01:32:37.171
Oh, my nose.

01:32:43.688 --> 01:32:46.020
You broke my nose.

01:32:46.091 --> 01:32:48.855
I really think I broke his nose.

01:32:48.927 --> 01:32:53.330
- You broke my nose.
- You did do it.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.473
So did you.

01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:07.912
It looks better that way.

01:33:09.546 --> 01:33:11.980
Oh, my nose, man!

01:33:12.049 --> 01:33:13.983
Hey, Moody!

01:33:16.954 --> 01:33:18.979
All right.

01:33:19.056 --> 01:33:20.387
Way to go.

01:33:21.458 --> 01:33:24.256
Real impressive fight.

01:33:28.499 --> 01:33:29.523
Okay, all right.

01:33:35.072 --> 01:33:37.006
I have a question.

01:33:37.074 --> 01:33:39.008
I had this idea.

01:33:39.076 --> 01:33:41.010
You're a good fighter.

01:33:41.078 --> 01:33:43.239
Would you like to be my bodyguard?

01:33:43.314 --> 01:33:45.544
I could pay you 50 cents a day.

01:33:45.616 --> 01:33:48.107
I can do your homework for you.
I'm pretty smart.

01:33:48.185 --> 01:33:50.619
Not interested.

01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:54.282
Anyway, a buck a day.

01:33:54.358 --> 01:33:55.290
A buck a day?

01:33:55.359 --> 01:33:56.553
Buck a day.
Inflation, buddy.

01:33:56.627 --> 01:33:57.559
Inflation?

01:33:57.628 --> 01:33:58.560
Yeah.

01:33:58.629 --> 01:34:00.688
Wait a minute.
