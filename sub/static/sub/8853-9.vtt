He is the premiere sword

00:55.630 --> 00:57.500
I get that,
but this entire thing

00:57.570 --> 01:00.340
is completely disrespectful
to the rap game.

01:00.410 --> 01:03.040
Are-

01:12.450 --> 01:15.450

01:17.960 --> 01:20.860
Those girls and some
big ol' boobs, right?

01:29.670 --> 01:30.630

Okay, look.

01:31.970 --> 01:34.270

01:34.340 --> 01:35.410

01:35.470 --> 01:38.480
Which is 4,178 years old.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.280

02:06.540 --> 02:07.640
It's cool.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.539
Did he just
bring those from home?

02:09.610 --> 02:10.979
Oh, yeah.

And the wizard beats, he says

Who's that lady?
Why is she just standing there?

02:31.730 --> 02:34.930
That's Sharon Levano.
She owns the building.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.530
What the [Bleep] Is he doing?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.340
Uh, we're on a stress break.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.570
We had a super busy morning,

02:39.640 --> 02:41.370
so we're just cuttin' loose.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.840
Yeah, I mean, we were
really pulling our hair out.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.140
But I'm sure he'll be

02:45.210 --> 02:47.310

02:47.380 --> 02:49.180

Have they met?

02:49.250 --> 02:50.850
Oh, my-
Okay!

02:50.920 --> 02:53.250
- Jesus Christ.
- Wow.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.820
Oh, my gosh, is that a-

02:57.990 --> 02:58.960
Whoa.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.690
Yeah, Adam.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.330
Uh, you're just-you're missing
wizard rehearsal again.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.130
So I'm just kind of
worried sick about you,

03:05.200 --> 03:06.600
wondering where you are.

03:06.670 --> 03:09.000
So-oh, here you are.
You are here.

03:09.070 --> 03:10.130
You're-
you're here in person.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.240
I'll talk to you... Now.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.570
Hey.
Dude, what the hell?

03:14.640 --> 03:16.240
Where have you been?
It's been like three days.

03:16.310 --> 03:17.710
Have you guys ever met someone

03:17.780 --> 03:19.310
that just gets you
on all levels?

03:19.380 --> 03:21.810
Makes you feel like your souls
are boning each other

03:21.880 --> 03:23.350
in the spirit world.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.780
Are you talking about
that super-old lady

03:25.850 --> 03:27.050
from the roof?

03:27.120 --> 03:29.320
Sharon is as old as my mom is.

03:29.390 --> 03:33.520
And her and my dad
have sex on the regular.

03:33.590 --> 03:35.460
Oh, and, fwi,

03:35.530 --> 03:36.760
I'm in love.

03:36.830 --> 03:39.860
I did it.

03:39.930 --> 03:41.270
So I'm gonna be moving out.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.000
Okay, it's not not "fwi. "

03:43.070 --> 03:45.970
It's f. Y.I.
"For your information. "

03:46.040 --> 03:48.640
Okay, Ders.

03:48.710 --> 03:50.410
I know how to spell, all right?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.110
And in the 75 hours
that I've known Sharon,

03:53.180 --> 03:54.810
she's done more for me

03:54.880 --> 03:57.250
and my bodybuilding career...

03:57.320 --> 03:58.820
Than you guys ever have.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.090
Dude, you can't just move out.

04:01.150 --> 04:02.250
What about rent?

04:02.320 --> 04:04.520
Yeah, what about, uh,
the wizards?

04:04.590 --> 04:05.760
Ren faire?

04:05.820 --> 04:07.890
You guys should
come over sometime.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.730
We've been thinking of doing
some more entertaining.

04:09.790 --> 04:12.900
Oh, and fwi, Ders...

04:12.960 --> 04:14.370

04:26.080 --> 04:28.610
Wow, he's really doing this.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.510
So what are we thinking?

04:30.580 --> 04:32.480
I'm thinking we gotta
break these two up.

04:32.550 --> 04:35.920
Lover boy is in
for a rude awakening.

04:35.990 --> 04:38.260
Rude!

04:38.320 --> 04:39.620
All right, here's the deal.

04:39.690 --> 04:42.360
I'm gonna get in there,
seduce Sharon old norse style,

04:42.430 --> 04:45.060
bed her down, and Adam will
never want a piece of her again.

04:45.130 --> 04:46.460
Wait, why do you always get
to seduce the girls.

04:46.530 --> 04:48.900
Because I have no emotions.

04:48.970 --> 04:50.370
You'll let your heart
get in the way.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.700
You know that.
Yeah, that's true.

04:51.770 --> 04:52.940
I can't just love 'em
and leave 'em.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.270
Never could.

04:54.340 --> 04:56.040
Actually, I've never had
the opportunity yet.

04:56.110 --> 04:57.580
Sharon!

04:57.640 --> 04:59.840
My work friends are here!

04:59.910 --> 05:01.610
Hey, buddy.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.110
These are for you.

05:03.180 --> 05:04.920
Wow, lookin' good.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.020
Thank you!
Let me show ya in.

05:07.090 --> 05:09.550
'Cause this pad is...
Sick!

05:09.620 --> 05:12.420
- He looks Asian. Wow.
- He looks somethin'.

05:13.630 --> 05:16.890
Whee!
Welcome to my house!

05:16.960 --> 05:18.430
Cool pad, right?

05:18.500 --> 05:21.100
We're just thinking of knocking
some walls out this bitch.

05:21.170 --> 05:23.400
Just really making it our own,
you know what I mean?

05:23.470 --> 05:25.870
It was her house.
Now it's gonna be our house.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.940
So we kind of have to adjust
to that whole sitch.

05:28.010 --> 05:30.270
Hey, buddy, someday, I hope
I have a house like this.

05:30.340 --> 05:32.110
Keep dreamin'.
Takes a lot of hard work.

05:32.180 --> 05:33.880
So I doubt
you're ready for it, but...

05:33.950 --> 05:35.310
Where's this little pond
you call a pool?

05:35.380 --> 05:36.810
Pool? Right out here.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.420
Guess what-Sharon has this dude
that comes and cleans it.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.750
Weekly.

05:40.820 --> 05:41.850
Let's go check it out.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.120
- Nope! Hey...
- Hang on.

05:43.190 --> 05:44.890
Why don't you let Ders
hit the pool?

05:44.960 --> 05:46.090
You need to show me
the rest of this house,

05:46.160 --> 05:47.560
if that's okay.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.560
<i>Oh, you want
the el touro de la grando, huh?</i>

05:49.630 --> 05:50.890
I think so.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.160
Spanish.
Learn Spanish.

05:52.230 --> 05:53.360
I'm gonna check out the pool.

05:53.430 --> 05:54.530
Spanish style.
Spanish style home.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.000
I'll see you guys.

05:57.070 --> 05:59.240
And this is the bedroom.
Uhh!

05:59.300 --> 06:01.370
Where the magic happens.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.270
- Ho ho ho!
- Yeah, a lot of magic.

06:03.340 --> 06:04.910
Lots o' magic.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.640
Careful, this door handle's
a little loose.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.310
Why? 'Cause of magic.

06:08.380 --> 06:10.250
Magic happened on this step.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.850
And some magic here.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.550
So this is her son's bedroom,

06:13.620 --> 06:15.990
a. K.A. Magic town.

06:16.050 --> 06:17.760
I get up something like this...

06:17.820 --> 06:19.620
And just do a lot of magic
this way.

06:19.690 --> 06:22.890
Oh, what do you think
that smell is, Blake?

06:22.960 --> 06:24.530
- Magic.
- Nope, Turkey bacon.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.070
You see that?

07:01.130 --> 07:02.800

07:05.540 --> 07:09.210
Whoo! You got that
butterfly joke, right?

07:09.270 --> 07:10.870
Yeah, I don't swim, so...

07:10.940 --> 07:12.980
Well, it's never
too late to learn.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.410
Oh... Okay, but I'm
taking my drink with me.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.110
Deal.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.900

07:38.310 --> 07:41.110
Just gettin' swoll

07:41.180 --> 07:43.010
Cool of you to disrespect
the wizard beats like that.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.140
That's not what they're for.

07:44.210 --> 07:45.810
Yeah?
Well, I'm using 'em.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.250
Let's go to the pool

07:47.320 --> 07:48.880
and see what Ders
is up to, right?

07:48.950 --> 07:50.250
No! Hey, wait.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.990
Why don't you show me
how this guy works, huh?

07:52.050 --> 07:54.390
- Ohh! Come on, dude.
- Oh, shoot.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.860
What did I say?
This is my tool shed.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.960
These are my tools,

07:57.030 --> 07:58.060
and you throw them
on the ground?

07:58.130 --> 07:59.060
I thought it was your office.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.590
It's both, all right?

08:00.660 --> 08:03.860
Show me how these tool/office
supplies work, bud.

08:03.930 --> 08:06.030
Okay.
This is my pen.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.100
And this is my wrench.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.470
Uhhaah!
Woof!

08:10.540 --> 08:11.970
Sometimes, I like to keep
the windows open

08:12.040 --> 08:14.480
and just scream loud
so, like, people think

08:14.540 --> 08:16.080
<i>we're having sex
or working out.</i>

08:16.140 --> 08:18.180
They're not sure-it's just
real guttural noises.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.710
Like, uhh!

08:20.780 --> 08:23.980
Uhhuhh!

08:24.050 --> 08:27.650
Ooohh!

08:27.720 --> 08:28.790
- Very cool.
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.860 --> 08:30.120
Don't worry.
I'm gonna be gentle.

08:30.190 --> 08:32.490
You just arch your back.
Lean back.

08:32.559 --> 08:35.000
Take a deep breath.

08:35.059 --> 08:37.130
Are you trying to seduce me?

08:37.200 --> 08:38.770
I'm trying to "seders" you.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.630
Uhhaah!

08:40.700 --> 08:42.299
Oh! Hello!

08:42.370 --> 08:44.140
Legs, heh heh.

08:44.210 --> 08:45.670
Bungee cord does the trick,

08:45.740 --> 08:46.970
I'll say that much.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.080
They say your calves are
75% genetics.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.510
But, uh, you know,

08:50.580 --> 08:52.850
evidently my grandpa demap
was a total pussy.

08:52.910 --> 08:54.580
The guy was not svelte.

08:54.650 --> 08:55.720
I don't know if I should-

08:55.780 --> 08:56.580
so I have a lot of work to do

08:56.650 --> 08:58.190
before the competition.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.820
I'll figure something out.
You sure about this?

08:59.890 --> 09:01.050
Yeah, make sure
you get low, dude.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.520
Get in that power squat.
Okay.

09:03.590 --> 09:04.760
And then just stay low
to the ground,

09:04.830 --> 09:05.560
work on your stems-
know what I mean?

09:05.630 --> 09:06.590
Yeah.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.060
Ders is diggin' the pool.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.330
Oh, no,
you probably shouldn't-

09:09.400 --> 09:10.460
- whoo!
- Okay-

09:10.530 --> 09:11.570
what the hell?

09:11.630 --> 09:13.770
Holmvik!
Adam, don't.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.240
Ders!

09:15.300 --> 09:17.140
No, wait, hold up.
You shouldn't-

09:17.210 --> 09:19.270
okay! God damn-

09:19.340 --> 09:20.310
Ders! He's coming!

09:20.380 --> 09:21.340
Do her quick!

09:21.410 --> 09:23.080
Anders holmvik!

09:23.140 --> 09:24.910
Guess what, dude?
We're gonna fight now.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.450
Are you ready for that?

09:26.510 --> 09:28.420
Um, I'm kind of in the middle
of a lesson right now.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.420
Ok, well, I'm kind of
in the middle

09:29.480 --> 09:30.620
of destroying your whole face.

09:30.690 --> 09:31.850
Move your legs
like an egg beater.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.990
Are you a man, Anders?

09:34.060 --> 09:36.260
You are frickin' dead, boy!

09:36.320 --> 09:38.430
You are so dead.
Bring it.

09:38.490 --> 09:41.660
- You are so dead, dude.
- Okay, hold the phone.

09:41.730 --> 09:44.160
You are fully torqued, bro.

09:44.230 --> 09:46.230
Well, yeah, I was about
to bone that lady!

09:46.300 --> 09:47.970
- Ohh.
- Yeah, okay, yes.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.340
But you're gonna have
to untorque your bone

09:50.410 --> 09:51.910
before we can
continue anything.

09:51.970 --> 09:54.170
I think everybody knows that
it's an unwritten rule:

09:54.240 --> 09:56.710
Warriors cannot collide
while erect.

09:56.780 --> 09:57.810
- Fine.
- Fine.

09:57.880 --> 09:58.980
- Take five.
- Crank down.

09:59.050 --> 10:00.450
Crank it down.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.550
I mean, it's a great backyard.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.380
Yean, it's pretty nice.

10:04.450 --> 10:05.820
Thinking about putting
a koi pond over there.

10:05.890 --> 10:07.590
- You got the room for it.
- Waterfall.

10:07.660 --> 10:08.560
- Might as well.
- Yeah.

10:08.620 --> 10:09.790
And the boner's down!
Fight!

10:09.860 --> 10:11.290
Ohh! Come on!

10:11.360 --> 10:12.830
Yeah, baby!

10:12.890 --> 10:14.190
Yeah, baby, what?

10:14.260 --> 10:15.430
- Whoa!
- Oh, yeah.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.600
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Choke it.

10:16.660 --> 10:17.630
Break up!
Break it up! Break it up!

10:17.700 --> 10:18.700
- What?
- What?

10:18.770 --> 10:19.900
You guys both have boners now.

10:19.970 --> 10:22.040
- What is going on?
- Wow!

10:22.100 --> 10:23.540
It's contagious, dude!

10:23.610 --> 10:25.710
You're too fleshy.
Put on a shirt.

10:25.770 --> 10:26.940
This guys smells great.

10:27.010 --> 10:28.080
It's like a coconut oil.
What is that?

10:28.140 --> 10:30.080
Thank you.
It's my tanning cream.

10:30.140 --> 10:31.110
Oh! Boners are down.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.380
I'm gonna ruin you, man.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.010
I'm gonna straight do
what I came here to do.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.480
I'm gonna straight wreck you!

10:35.550 --> 10:38.750
You're gonna die at my feet,
you small-minded-

10:38.820 --> 10:40.220
- okay, I've got a boner.
- I've got one too.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.390
Soon as I said "my feet,"
it was like...

10:41.460 --> 10:42.920
Yeah, all the blood
just sort of-

10:42.990 --> 10:44.690
that happened to me too.
That's what's weird about it.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.130
- That's cool.
- This is really weird.

10:46.190 --> 10:47.860
You know what?
We're not gonna fight right now.

10:47.930 --> 10:49.230
That's official.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.900
I'm torqued.
You're torqued right now.

10:50.970 --> 10:52.600
But I know you can leave.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.270
You can leave my house
and respect my woman.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.600
That's what you can do.
Fine.

10:55.670 --> 10:56.740
- Leave.
- Gladly.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.140
Well, I have
a little announcement

10:58.210 --> 11:00.170
for you, sir, because
you broke the blood oath,

11:00.240 --> 11:02.440
and I want you to leave
our wizard crew.

11:02.510 --> 11:03.510
What? Yeah.
Like I care.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.380
And I'm taking the beats back.

11:05.450 --> 11:06.680
- Ah, don't take the beats.
- Yeah.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.680
No, don't take the beats.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.580
Ohh! Don't take the beats!

11:09.650 --> 11:11.490
I'm super-sad
about the beats!

11:11.550 --> 11:13.950
I don't care, dude, because I
have a bodybuilding competition

11:14.020 --> 11:15.120
on the same day.

11:15.190 --> 11:16.560
And that's more important to me

11:16.620 --> 11:19.530
than dressing up
like a fairy wizard.

11:19.590 --> 11:20.590
- Wow.
- You know what, man?

11:20.660 --> 11:21.930
It did not have
to go like this.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.930
We're out of here.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.130
You're such a dumb idiot!

11:26.200 --> 11:27.170
Wow, okay.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.500
I don't care.

11:28.570 --> 11:30.070
I hope this goes away soon.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.370
You infected me
with your boner.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.270
We are going to be just fine.

11:33.340 --> 11:34.840
Okay? We do not need Adam.

11:34.910 --> 11:35.840
Oh, no.
We're great.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.110
We're awesome, heh.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.450
Just the two of us.
Best roommates ever.

11:39.510 --> 11:40.710
Nothin's gonna change.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.550
Nope.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.050
<i>Nothing is going to change!</i>

11:50.090 --> 11:51.930
It's not changing, buddy.
I know, I got that.

11:51.990 --> 11:53.290
You're in the back.
Okay.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.600
Blake! Beer me, dude!

11:55.660 --> 11:58.130
One for big Ders,
and one for little Adam.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.030

Yeah.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.820

12:21.890 --> 12:24.560
No, this is not working at all.

12:31.170 --> 12:33.270
How you doin'?
Thanks for having me over, guys.

12:33.330 --> 12:36.000
I'm ready to, uh, to join
human society one more time.

so much stronger.

12:59.630 --> 13:01.690
Right arm, you're kind of
looking weak over there, buddy.

13:01.760 --> 13:02.960
My office, five minutes.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.300
Brush your teeth,
cut your fingernails,

13:04.360 --> 13:05.900
and powder your balls.

13:05.970 --> 13:08.800
I might even floss for you.

13:08.870 --> 13:11.240
Whaaat?

13:11.300 --> 13:12.970
Ohh! Yeah, that's it.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.670
We're done.
Thank you.

13:14.740 --> 13:17.710
Wow, that was-
that was exhausting.

13:17.780 --> 13:20.010
My jaw hurts pretty bad.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.910
It was-
ah, that was fun, though.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.950
That was, like, intimate.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.350
You were right up
in here, so...

13:26.420 --> 13:28.190
Hey, where's that going?
Where's that-keep-

13:28.250 --> 13:30.020
- I'm taking it off.
It's like it hurts pretty-

13:30.090 --> 13:32.290
- yeah, that's okay.
You'll form a callus.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.190
It's supposed to happen.
Keep it on. Be tough.

13:34.260 --> 13:35.930
Okay.

13:37.430 --> 13:39.130
Hey, maybe next time
we can use the strap-on

13:39.200 --> 13:40.770
that God gave me, my-

13:40.830 --> 13:43.400
pass. Pass.

13:43.470 --> 13:45.000
No.
My...

13:47.610 --> 13:49.140
Just gonna get 'em
taken up a little bit.

13:49.210 --> 13:50.340
I appreciate all your hard...

13:50.410 --> 13:52.480
Hey, guys, check out
my new wizard costume.

13:52.550 --> 13:53.850
What's up?
Karl...

13:53.910 --> 13:55.950
We're not barbarians.
What are you doing?

13:56.020 --> 13:59.620
You're dressed like some kind
of God damn farm shaman.

13:59.690 --> 14:01.450
No, I'm a high priest.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.420
Whoo! And I won!

14:03.490 --> 14:05.520
Yeah, baby, I wasn't even
racin' anyone,

14:05.590 --> 14:07.260
but I would have won if I were.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.260
I'd just like you to know
that you are trespassing.

14:09.330 --> 14:11.360
All right?
And we are gonna just assume

14:11.430 --> 14:12.960
that you are an intruder
at this point.

14:13.030 --> 14:14.400
Okay, I'm sorry,

14:14.470 --> 14:16.330
I'm just here to get
some clean shirts for work.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.870
So if you wouldn't mind
excusing me.

14:20.540 --> 14:22.210
Hey, watch the candles.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.140
Oh, Jesus, Karl.

14:24.210 --> 14:25.410
That's pretty cool, right?

14:25.480 --> 14:26.880
You know what?
I think it's super-cute

14:26.950 --> 14:29.410
that you guys are taking
this whole wizard/caveman thing

14:29.480 --> 14:30.650
so seriously, I really do.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.350
Yoooo!

14:33.420 --> 14:34.750
Well, we are,
and guess what-

14:34.820 --> 14:36.790
Karl is taking the wizards
to a whole new level.

14:36.860 --> 14:37.990
- Yeah.
- That's right.

14:38.060 --> 14:39.320
Speaking of that level, guys,

14:39.390 --> 14:41.430
did I show you my crossbow?

14:41.490 --> 14:45.530
You're ruining my life.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.070
Okay, so remember,
wizards are immortal.

14:48.130 --> 14:50.400
So they pretty much see
everything they've ever loved

14:50.470 --> 14:51.700
pass away before them.

14:51.770 --> 14:52.640
- Uh-
- All right?

14:52.710 --> 14:54.470
Sad. But it's raw.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.140
Use that emotion, okay?

14:56.210 --> 14:57.340
- Cool, cool.
- Thanks.

14:57.410 --> 14:58.710
Awesome.
Karl, go ahead and hit it.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.310
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

15:00.380 --> 15:03.850
Ohh. The cd is gone.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.580
Adam.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.490
Whoo!
Let's do this, boys!

15:10.560 --> 15:11.760
Lookin' swoll, lookin' good.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.730
Good luck out there.
I believe in all of us.

15:13.790 --> 15:15.890
We're all gonna-we're
all gonna take a trophy home.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.730
Are you the mascot for
the competition or something?

15:17.800 --> 15:19.300
Is that what you do?

15:19.370 --> 15:20.930
<i>Are you the mascot for
the competition somethin?</i>

15:21.000 --> 15:22.570
Do we have a beef
already, dude?

15:22.640 --> 15:23.740
All right, well...

15:23.800 --> 15:25.200
Just be careful
out there, all right?

15:25.270 --> 15:28.810
Careful?
I never am.

15:30.710 --> 15:33.510
Whoo!

15:33.580 --> 15:36.150
Aggh.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.750
Welcome to the tri-valley

15:37.820 --> 15:39.750
amateur bodybuilders
competition.

15:39.820 --> 15:43.460
Give it up for our contenders!

15:53.700 --> 15:55.330
Hey, there's Barry.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.440
I sold that guy a garbage bag
full of growth hormones.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
Hey, you're lookin' huge,
Barry!

15:59.570 --> 16:02.040
Wow, this is pathetic.

16:02.110 --> 16:04.010
Adam looks like
a baby man up there.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.440
Let's focus here.

16:05.510 --> 16:07.450
Let's just get the beats
and then get out of here.

16:07.510 --> 16:10.020
We are like three hours
away from performing

16:10.080 --> 16:11.850
in front of horses and knights.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.250
Uh, I think we're gonna
stay for the solo.
