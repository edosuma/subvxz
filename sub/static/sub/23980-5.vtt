00:02.520 --> 00:04.720
# We're not going out

00:04.720 --> 00:06.520
# Not staying in

00:06.520 --> 00:09.120
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.120 --> 00:12.160
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:12.160 --> 00:15.400
# We're not going out

00:21.880 --> 00:25.000
Lee Lee?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.080
I think he's going deaf.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.680
He has the TV volume up like it's
an old people's home.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.040
Toby wears headphones.
For TV or music?

00:32.040 --> 00:35.000
Just generally around the house.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.600
Well, luckily, the kids are heavy
sleepers.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.240
We've been watching this brutal

00:39.240 --> 00:41.640
Scandinavian crime series on
Netflix. It's brilliant.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.840
It's about a spate of killings
and... Don't tell me!

00:43.840 --> 00:45.520
Oh, are you watching it, too?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.360
No, it's just very boring listening

00:47.360 --> 00:49.720
to people describe box sets on
Netflix.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.080
Anyway, I'd better get going
and hide this shopping.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.840
I have to be secretive.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.320
Toby hates me spending money. It
causes all sorts of rows.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.240
I bet he'll like all that
sexy lingerie.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.720
Well, I'm saving
that for our trip to Tuscany.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.599
A different, brand-new set of
underwear for every day of the week.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.720
Ooh, I might suggest that
idea to Lee.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.720
You know, changing his underpants
every day.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.400
I want it to be a surprise,

01:11.400 --> 01:14.520
so don't mention anything
when you see Toby later. Later?

01:14.520 --> 01:17.880
Tonight. You and Lee are still
coming round for dinner, aren't you?

01:17.880 --> 01:20.240
Oh, yes! Of course.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.200
For a minute there I thought
you'd forgotten. No.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.120
Then there really would be
a spate of killings.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.760
Well, two anyway.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.440
No, we haven't forgotten.
Mum's all booked in to babysit.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.680
Good. I'm doing a
nuestra saffron paella.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.920
Don't worry if Lee's not keen -
I've got fish fingers. Great.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.080
See you at eight. Seven.
Just testing.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.200 --> 01:55.080
Ah, there you are.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.360
Right, straight upstairs, kids,
and clean your teeth.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.400
I want you asleep early tonight,
so don't worry
about the ones at the back.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.680
I took them for pizza so we could
crack straight on with the box set.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.760
Oh, I'm so excited. I've been
looking forward to this all day.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.680
I wouldn't bother doing that.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.960
Well, I've got to.
I can't look at a dead Scandinavian

02:10.960 --> 02:14.000
unless my cushions are plump.
Oh, have you been shopping?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.480
Yeah.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.880
Anna took me to the place where
she buys all her underwear.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.680
I thought the ironmongers closed
early on a Thursday.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.720
She bought some very nice things,
actually,

02:22.720 --> 02:25.040
but apparently she
and Toby argue about money,

02:25.040 --> 02:27.840
so she has to be all secretive and
put it somewhere he won't see it.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.560
What, on?

02:30.560 --> 02:32.080
I can't believe we're going to

02:32.080 --> 02:34.120
finally find out who that
murderer is.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.200
I reckon it's the big beardy one
who smokes a pipe.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.120
Or her husband.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.240
We can't watch it tonight.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.480
We've got to go to Anna
and Toby's for dinner.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.480
What?

02:48.480 --> 02:50.760
I agreed to it last week
and then it just slipped my mind.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.680
I'm sorry, I forgot.
I'm sorry you remembered.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.760
Well, we'll just have to watch
it tomorrow.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.360
We can't watch it tomorrow.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.520
Jackie at work will spoil
the ending for me.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.520
She's finishing the series
tonight as well,

03:01.520 --> 03:04.320
and she'll waltz into work
tomorrow in her fake Jimmy Choos,

03:04.320 --> 03:06.800
and before you know it, it'll be
the talk of the coffee room.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.440
I'm sorry, have you started
working in a nail salon?

03:09.440 --> 03:12.360
We have to watch it tonight.
OK, how about this?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.560
We go to Anna and Toby's
and we leave as early as we can,

03:14.560 --> 03:17.480
then we come back and watch it.
No chance. We'll be knackered.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.040
And I know what you're like,

03:19.040 --> 03:21.240
you'll be asleep before I press
the little red button.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.920
Sorry, are we still
talking about the TV show?

03:23.920 --> 03:27.640
Tell Anna we've got other plans.
She'll understand. No, she won't.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.400
She was bad enough when I cancelled

03:29.400 --> 03:32.080
a coffee morning to give birth to
the twins.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.120
Can't you say
one of the kids is sick?

03:34.120 --> 03:35.840
What, you mean lie?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.840
Well, unless you want to
poison one of them

03:37.840 --> 03:40.680
for the sake of your conscience.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.840
You'll be fine,
just break it to her gently.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.320
I don't want to.
I'm terrible at lying.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.920
I've got an idea - text her. No!
If we did it by text,

03:56.920 --> 03:59.640
Anna would never speak to us again.
I've got an idea -

03:59.640 --> 04:02.160
text her.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.440
Oh, give it here. I'll do it.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.680
There you go, it's ringing.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.880
Thanks a lot, Lee!
What would I do without you?

04:12.880 --> 04:16.000
That isn't rhetorical.
I've started a list.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.440
Oh, hi, Anna. How are you?

04:18.440 --> 04:21.079
Yes, all fine. Really looking
forward to you both...

04:21.079 --> 04:22.800
We're not coming.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.280
Oh, that's it,
break it to her gently.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.880
I'm sorry, it's Molly. She's ill.
Oh.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.560
She seemed full of beans
when I saw her this morning.

04:31.560 --> 04:35.160
Yes, she was, but that was before
the play date,

04:35.160 --> 04:38.480
at...Waterpark World.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.520
You know what those places are like,
teeming with germs and diseases.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.560
I didn't go to Waterpark World!

04:47.160 --> 04:50.080
I want to go to Waterpark World!
You can't go to Waterpark World.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.400
Why not Because your mother just
invented it. It's not fair!

04:54.400 --> 04:56.520
But if you shush
and go to your bedroom,

04:56.520 --> 04:59.800
I'll take you to a real water park.
Now Well, not now, obviously.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.520
When One day. It's not fair!

05:03.520 --> 05:07.520
Tomorrow Yeeeeeaaaaah!

05:07.520 --> 05:11.200
Benji, I've told you,
be quiet! Your sister's ill!

05:11.200 --> 05:13.280
She doesn't look ill.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.320
But I thought you said your mother
was baby-sitting.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.600
Wendy's wonderful with the children.
Yeah, but Molly's really ill.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.920
Why What are the symptoms?

05:23.920 --> 05:25.440
Symptoms?

05:25.440 --> 05:27.760
She's got bad breath.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.800
Oh, no, she's being sick.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.240
Which probably explains
the bad breath.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.760
And she's...flushed.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.840
Diarrhoea!

05:37.840 --> 05:40.640
Lucy, she sounds awful. Yeah.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.440
So, we'll just have to reschedule.
I'm sorry, Anna.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.320
Well, not your fault, I guess.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.880
Toby and I will find
something else to do.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.760
I'm sure we can re-heat an old
argument from last week.

05:52.760 --> 05:56.720
Thanks for being
so understanding, Anna. Bye.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.240
Bye.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.200
I feel awful.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.520
You've probably caught
something off Molly.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.160
Have you turned your mobile off?
We don't want any distractions.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.720
You unplugged the landline?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.720
Have you turned off that annoying
beep on the computer that

06:28.720 --> 06:30.720
says you've got mail Yes.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.880
Because it's lovely to watch without
distractions, isn't it?

06:35.560 --> 06:37.880
I reckon that shepherd might
be the murderer.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.400
Or possibly the next victim.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.040
Herregud!

06:47.800 --> 06:52.960
What "Herregud."
It means, "Oh, my God!"

06:52.960 --> 06:55.520
Watching this, I think
I've picked up some Scandinavian.

06:55.520 --> 06:59.840
Scandinavian isn't a language.
Bit racist.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.080
All right, I've picked up
a bit of Swedish.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.560
That's very impressive, especially
given that it's set in Norway.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.320
It's the same thing. No, it isn't.
Sweden is IKEA and Abba.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.280
Norway is...

07:13.280 --> 07:14.720
whatever.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.360
Oh, what's she doing in there?
That's not her office.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.560
A-ha! Have you worked it out?

07:21.560 --> 07:24.160
No, I'm just thinking, A-ha,
they were from Norway.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.840
Oh! What if he catches her going
through the files?

07:32.840 --> 07:35.200
He won't... Will he?

07:41.120 --> 07:44.560
Who the hell is that I don't know!
Pause it.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.360
Herregud!

07:49.360 --> 07:52.840
Sorry to turn up unannounced.
Not interrupting anything, are we?

07:52.840 --> 07:55.400
I did try to phone several times,
but there was no answer.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.200
Oh, my phone's switched off.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.120
Er, because we didn't want to wake
Molly, who,

07:59.120 --> 08:00.360
as you know, is very ill.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.720
Well, that's why we're here.
I told Toby the symptoms.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.200
And I'm sure it's nothing serious,

08:04.200 --> 08:06.280
but I am more than happy to
check her over.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.520
Look, there's no point in having
a mate who's a doctor

08:08.520 --> 08:10.320
if you don't abuse the friendship.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.280
You were obviously worried about
her, Lucy,

08:12.280 --> 08:14.040
or you wouldn't have cancelled
dinner.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.160
Go on, Toby, it'll put their minds
at rest.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.960
Oh, no, no! She's fast asleep.
I just looked in on her.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.560
She's completely zonked.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.400
That's Charlie. How do you know?

08:25.400 --> 08:28.320
I recognise his flush.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.040
Maybe Molly's just been
sick again. Oh, it'll be fine.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.360
What's the worst that can happen?
She could have passed
out on the bathroom floor.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.360
Well, we've got underfloor heating,
she'll be warm.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.679
Mummy,
can I have a biscuit for my teddies?

08:40.679 --> 08:42.919
They're having a disco party!

08:46.120 --> 08:48.280
You're supposed to be in bed,
asleep.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.680
I know, but I'm
so excited about tomorrow.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.720
We're going to a water park. Again?

08:54.720 --> 08:57.640
Well, she's very ill. It's very
important that we make all her

08:57.640 --> 09:00.680
dreams come true, as fast as we can.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.040
But you said she went to
Waterpark World today.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.200
I didn't go to Waterpark World!
Yes, you did!

09:06.200 --> 09:08.480
How could I?
Daddy said you made it up.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.200
I'm starting to think Molly was
never ill at all, Lucy.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.000
Is this true Have you been lying
all along, young lady?

09:17.080 --> 09:19.760
Molly, go back up to bed now,
please. I'll tuck her in.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.640
No, you won't.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.200
I'm sorry, Anna.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.400
We lied about Molly being ill.
Lucy, that's awful!

09:28.400 --> 09:30.480
You had us
both really worried about her!

09:30.480 --> 09:32.120
Why would you do that?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.640
Because the real reason
for cancelling dinner is silly,

09:34.640 --> 09:37.840
and to be honest, I'm very
embarrassed about it. Go on.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.840
The reason we lied was...

09:41.560 --> 09:43.880
..because Lee and I had a massive
row.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.440
Oh. I mean a really big one,
didn't we?

09:48.440 --> 09:51.120
Yes, we did. You cow.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.160
And I'm really sorry,

09:55.160 --> 09:57.440
I just couldn't face
the idea of coming over for dinner.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.360
The fact is, right at this moment,

09:59.360 --> 10:02.600
I can hardly bear to
look at his ugly face. Bit harsh.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.440
And what was the row about,
if you don't mind me asking.

10:05.440 --> 10:11.000
Just how Lee never does
anything around the house.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.840
I do my bit.
A "bit". Do you see A bit.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.480
Not quite a full share,
is it, a bit?

10:17.480 --> 10:19.320
Try washing up for once.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.840
I do wash up. What I don't do is put
loads of pans in the sink,

10:21.840 --> 10:24.680
leave them to soak and let them
go cold and greasy.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.480
That kind of thing.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.080
That's it?
You cancelled dinner for that?

10:29.080 --> 10:32.920
We had a worse argument than
that on the drive over here.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.400
Well, yeah, but that was just

10:34.400 --> 10:37.040
the start of our row. It got much
worse than that. Why?

10:37.040 --> 10:41.840
Because Lee did something
much worse. What Yeah, what?

10:41.840 --> 10:45.920
You know what. Yeah, but you say.

10:45.920 --> 10:50.760
He spoilt that TV show we've been
watching on Netflix.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.360
The Oslo Murders?

10:52.360 --> 10:54.400
Not that we were watching it
tonight, of course,

10:54.400 --> 10:56.560
because we were supposed to be
coming round to yours.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.240
Exactly, but Jackie, who Lee works
with, told Lee how it ends,

10:59.240 --> 11:01.760
and then Lee told me
the second he walked in the door.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.640
That wasn't a very nice
thing to do, Lee.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.960
Well, I just figured if I couldn't
enjoy it, then neither could you.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.120
So now there's no
point in either of us watching it.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.200
Right.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.280
But you decided to watch it anyway.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.600
Well, we were watching it, but then
we stopped when Lee ruined it.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.120
But you said you weren't
watching it tonight because you were

11:24.120 --> 11:26.040
coming round to our house.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.480
Yeah, but we were just watching it
a little bit before we came

11:28.480 --> 11:31.480
round to your house, but then the
row happened, because Lee spoilt it.

11:31.480 --> 11:36.760
But you just said Lee ruined it
the second he got home from work.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.560
Gosh, haven't you got a good
memory for the things I say?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.480
Which means you were watching
it on your own.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.080
And you said you'd been
watching it together.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.560
I think it's time for the real
truth, Lucy.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.000
The truth is- Lucy's been
so obsessed with this TV

11:53.000 --> 11:56.840
show that she couldn't wait and she
was secretly watching it without me.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.680
Box-set cheating!

11:59.680 --> 12:02.560
Lucy, that's an awful thing to do!
That's what I said.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.600
I was so livid when I walked in and
caught her that

12:04.600 --> 12:06.480
I decided to spoil the ending.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.240
And that's when the row broke out,
and then it got out of hand,

12:09.240 --> 12:11.680
and that's when we cancelled dinner.
The end.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.640
Yeah, you spoiled everything.
You dirty great...spoiler!

12:15.640 --> 12:19.920
Cheat! Wassock!
Oh, shave your armpits!

12:19.920 --> 12:22.760
Stop it, both of you!
You need some time apart.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.320
Lee, I'm going to drop you
and Toby off at the coffee shop.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.040
What You need to calm down.
Yeah, and what better way to do that

12:28.040 --> 12:30.160
than a big mug of caffeine at
8:30pm?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.440
Thanks for the offer, but I think
I'll stay here.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.200
Nonsense. Toby will talk to you -
he's good at that.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.160
Guaranteed to drain the passion
out of any situation.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.160
Oh, you say the sweetest things.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.160
OK. I won't be long.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.720
Just one quick coffee
and I'll be straight back.

12:46.720 --> 12:50.640
You box-set cheating, nagging
old...pillock!

12:50.640 --> 12:54.520
All right then...ugly!
Can you stop saying that?

13:02.920 --> 13:05.240
That was a very helpful talk.
Thanks, Toby.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.160
I think I'm ready to get
back home now.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.160
All I said was, "There's your
coffee."

13:09.160 --> 13:11.760
I'll tell you something,
that woman at work did you a real

13:11.760 --> 13:14.320
favour by telling you
the ending of The Oslo Murders.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.040
How do you mean?
Well, it was very disappointing.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.000
Didn't you think?
What, you've seen it Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.240
Watched the whole
thing on a long-haul flight.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.280
I wish I hadn't bothered, really.
The ending was so cliched.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.840
"I can now reveal that the
killer is..."

13:30.840 --> 13:33.640
Don't! Don't...remind me.

13:33.640 --> 13:38.920
Such a...cliche.
Bloody Norwegians and their cliches.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.040
So did you guess who the
murderer was?

13:41.040 --> 13:43.000
Yeah, I thought
it was pretty obvious.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.560
Really I thought
it was ridiculously far-fetched.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.680
Well, yeah, it was far-fetched,
in an obvious sort of way.

13:48.680 --> 13:53.400
I knew he was the murderer
all along. "He?" She.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.200
I'm a modern man -
I don't see gender.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.760
Are you sure you're telling me
the truth here, Lee?

13:58.760 --> 14:01.680
Yeah. So you definitely know who the
murderer is?

14:01.680 --> 14:04.080
Yeah.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.760
So if I was to say the name
of the murderer, that would be fine?

14:07.760 --> 14:09.320
Yeah.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.080
The murderer is... La-la!

14:15.600 --> 14:19.560
Lala From the Teletubbies?

14:19.560 --> 14:22.400
It wasn't that far-fetched!

14:22.400 --> 14:26.080
All right, I don't know who the
murderer is! Neither does Lucy.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.160
Well, thank you for being honest at
last.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.280
Well, I didn't have much choice, did
I?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.720
Oh, I don't know, you could have
pretended that the

14:32.720 --> 14:35.040
woman at work lied to you
and told you a fake ending.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.320
Can I change my story No.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.200
And just for your information,

14:40.200 --> 14:42.840
I don't know who the murderer is
either. I just made that bit up,

14:42.840 --> 14:45.680
because I'm not the kind of person
who spoils things for other

14:45.680 --> 14:50.520
people, unlike you, for example,
spoiling my evening with Anna!

14:50.520 --> 14:53.640
Sorry. I was looking forward to you
both coming round.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.720
Anna's a lot nicer to me
when there are witnesses.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.280
So, come on, the truth.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.680
What, you want me to actually say
it You already know.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.360
Well, I know you were rowing,
but I don't know what it was about.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.480
You know we were rowing?
Yeah, obviously.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.800
But it wasn't about some
silly TV show.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.520
So, come on, what were you really
rowing about that made you

15:14.520 --> 15:18.040
cancel, after all Anna's hard work?

15:18.040 --> 15:21.120
It was about money. Ah.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.120
If I had a penny for every time
we'd had that argument,

15:24.120 --> 15:26.680
Anna would spend it on handbags.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.560
Exactly.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.520
Lucy goes out, spending
money on fancy clothes,

15:30.520 --> 15:32.840
then hides them from me.
That would annoy you, right?

15:32.840 --> 15:35.080
Oh, I can empathise with
that all right.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.080
What sort of stuff?

15:37.080 --> 15:39.240
Well, you know, sexy underwear.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.040
And if she's hiding it from me,

15:41.040 --> 15:42.960
I don't even get
the pleasure of seeing it.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.600
Oh, God, you mean she's not
wearing it for you?! Exactly.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.640
So she's wearing
it for someone else! Yep.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.840
No! No, no, I don't mean that!

15:51.840 --> 15:55.360
No, I mean she's wearing
it for herself. Probably.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.120
Is that right?

15:57.120 --> 15:59.680
Listen, Lee, if you've got any
suspicions about Lucy, you can

15:59.680 --> 16:01.760
tell me. We are mates.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.040
And it would certainly explain
your disgraceful behaviour tonight.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.440
Would it Yeah.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.360
Well, maybe I do have a
couple of doubts.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.400
OK. Who is he?

16:14.400 --> 16:17.000
"He?" Or she.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.640
Or are you not seeing gender again?

16:19.640 --> 16:22.280
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
We'll get through this.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.480
We said our marriage vows
and we meant them.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.960
Apart from the "richer" bit.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.240
That was just me going through the
motions.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.560
So I'd appreciate it if you don't
mention this again to anyone.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.880
Perhaps you should go home.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.520
I'm fine. I'm completely relaxed
here.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.640
That's mayonnaise.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.480
I know.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.880
How did it go Yeah, fine.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.800
You didn't tell Toby the truth,
did you?

16:55.800 --> 16:58.160
I can absolutely assure you,
hand-on-heart,

16:58.160 --> 17:00.080
that I did not tell him the truth.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.440
Right, now can
we just carry on watching this

17:03.440 --> 17:05.280
and find out who the murderer is?

17:05.280 --> 17:07.319
You weren't watching it without me,
I hope.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.599
Are you accusing me of being a
cheat A cheat Of course not.

17:10.599 --> 17:14.520
Oh, imagine! But if I did accuse you
of being a cheat, and I made it up

17:14.520 --> 17:17.480
because I knew that you weren't, I
bet you'd forgive me, wouldn't you?

17:17.480 --> 17:21.319
What are you talking about?
I've absolutely no idea.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.760
Oh, my God, there's a car outside.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.560
It's Anna. What does she want now?

17:27.560 --> 17:29.760
Don't let her in!

17:29.760 --> 17:32.440
Well, why not She believed we
rowed. Exactly.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.160
She'll be coming round to see if us

17:34.160 --> 17:36.680
two have made up yet. We won't be
able to get rid of her for ages

17:36.680 --> 17:39.960
and we won't get to watch the TV
show. She knows we're in. I've got
to open the door.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.160
No! I'll tell her you've
gone to bed early.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.880
If she knows it's just me, she'll
leave like there's a bad smell.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.240
Yeah, but what if she doesn't?

17:46.240 --> 17:47.840
Lucy, I've had a takeaway curry

17:47.840 --> 17:50.480
with three sides and a Peshwari
naan - trust me, we'll be fine.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.200
Anna. Toby told me everything.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.760
I am so sorry.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.720
I'm sorry he told you
everything, too.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.920
I know it's none of my business,
but as her friend,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.840
I feel I had to come round and talk
to Lucy.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.840
You can't talk to Lucy.
She's in bed, asleep.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.360
So if you could just keep your voice
very, very quiet indeed...

18:16.360 --> 18:19.440
How long has it been going on?
Quieter.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.840
I feel very bad about earlier.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.480
Toby and I made such a fuss
about you two cancelling dinner, and

18:24.480 --> 18:27.400
all along you're in the middle of
this huge crisis in your marriage.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.160
Not really.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.800
You don't have to be strong, Lee.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.280
This is me, Anna.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.960
I can see you want to cry.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.880
I do, yes.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.280
Don't underestimate
the effect of infidelity.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.320
I'm not 100% sure
she has been infidelicate.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.120
I can see you're not going to
open up for me. Yes, I am.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.480
Fine.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.800
I'll talk it all through with
Lucy tomorrow. No, you won't.

18:56.800 --> 19:01.600
Why not Because my conversation
with Toby was confidential.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
He wasn't supposed to
tell you about it.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.360
What, so I'm supposed to never
mention it to her Yes, please.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.360
Act like I don't know That's it.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.120
Perhaps I should move to another
town and never talk to Lucy again?

19:11.120 --> 19:13.120
I mean, if you could, that would be
absol...

19:13.120 --> 19:14.600
Oh, right, you're being sarcastic.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.320
I can't not talk to her about this.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.760
Please, Anna, I am fighting for my
marriage here.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.040
Are you Well, I will be if you talk
to Lucy.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.480
Please, I need all the help
I can get.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.080
Well, all right.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.280
I suppose I can pretend we never had
this conversation. Thanks.

19:30.520 --> 19:35.400
But remember, Lee, an affair doesn't
have to be the end of a marriage.

19:35.400 --> 19:39.720
If you ever want to talk to me,
the door is always open.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.400
What did she mean, "An affair

19:45.400 --> 19:47.960
"doesn't have to be the end of a
marriage"?

19:47.960 --> 19:51.120
I'm starting to think this Netflix
programme isn't dramatic enough,

19:51.120 --> 19:53.960
because real life is far more tense.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.120
Who's having an affair?

19:56.120 --> 20:00.040
Something happened with me
and Toby in the coffee shop.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.040
Wow! I knew you two were close...

20:05.040 --> 20:08.120
The thing is, something was said.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.920
What?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.920
Just tell me.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.560
Anna's having an affair.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.640
What?! I know. I was amazed, too.

20:20.640 --> 20:24.240
Even listening to myself now,
I can't quite believe I'm saying it.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.400
Oh, my God! I don't know where to
start.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.920
I've got so many questions. Oh,
good. With who?

20:29.920 --> 20:33.280
Not me, that's for sure.
Well, didn't you ask?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.840
No.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.560
Once I found out it wasn't me,
I was so relieved, I didn't care.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.600
Why didn't you tell me about this

20:39.600 --> 20:41.640
when you got
back from the coffee shop?

20:41.640 --> 20:44.400
Because Toby made me
promise not to tell anyone.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.040
And I keep my promises.
So why did Anna come round just now?

20:48.040 --> 20:52.800
Because she assumed I had told you,
but I hadn't,

20:52.800 --> 20:55.720
so I sent her packing. Right.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.400
So as far as Anna and Toby are
concerned, you don't know anything

20:58.400 --> 21:01.960
about this, so you can't mention
anything to them at all, ever.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.800
Right.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.960
Now that's all sorted, let's get
back to this TV show, shall we?

21:08.960 --> 21:11.800
Oh, the fishmonger's wife has looked
dodgy from episode one.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.120
I just can't believe she'd do
something like that.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.080
Well, she has got access to a big
knife for gutting herring.

21:20.160 --> 21:24.200
I can't believe Anna would cheat.
What made Toby suspicious?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.560
As you know, she has been spending
money on fancy clothes.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.240
Well, that's not evidence!

21:28.240 --> 21:31.360
No, but like you said,
she has been buying sexy underwear

21:31.360 --> 21:33.080
and hiding it from him. I mean, you

21:33.080 --> 21:35.080
said it's because they argue about
money,

21:35.080 --> 21:37.680
but perhaps she has other reasons.
She does have other reasons!

21:37.680 --> 21:40.240
She bought it for when they're on
holiday in Tuscany.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.400
It's supposed to be a big surprise
for Toby!

21:43.400 --> 21:46.040
Not because she's having an affair.
Good.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.200
So, Anna's not having an affair.
I told Toby he was probably wrong.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.000
Everything's tickety-boo.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.400
It's not tickety-boo,
it's tickety-bollocks!

21:53.400 --> 21:54.880
Toby needs to know the truth.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.080
Stay with the kids!

22:01.760 --> 22:03.400
Wendy!

22:03.400 --> 22:06.000
We need you to come round right away
and babysit, please!

22:06.000 --> 22:07.920
Yes, I know we cancelled on you
already,

22:07.920 --> 22:11.040
but, look, I'll just be completely
honest with you...

22:13.240 --> 22:15.480
Lucy's at the hospital with
food poisoning.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.280
Lucy! Sorry for calling
around so late.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.920
No, you are always welcome,
any time. Come in.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.520
I've, um, I've been driving around
for a

22:31.520 --> 22:34.000
while, thinking about exactly how
I should approach this.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.960
It's OK, Lucy, I'm glad you came.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.800
Ah, Lucy.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.720
Does Lee know where you are?
Of course he does.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.000
Where else would I be I don't know,
Lucy, where else would you be?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.440
Did you want to
talk about something, Lucy?

22:48.440 --> 22:50.320
Well, I think
we all know why I'm here,

22:50.320 --> 22:52.720
so I'll just get
straight to the point.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.120
It's about this so-called affair.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.600
"So-called"?
Yes, Toby, so-called.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.880
Just because a woman goes
shopping for nice underwear

22:59.880 --> 23:02.320
doesn't mean she has to be
cheating on her husband.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.760
No, unless that husband never
gets to see the underwear.

23:04.760 --> 23:08.040
What do you have to say about that,
Lucy Toby! Yeah, all right.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.160
I didn't have to come here.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.760
I could be on the sofa, getting
stuck into an Indian.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.320
Where are the kids?
I got your mum over.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.720
Why What are you doing here?
Checking up on you, I should think.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.040
Lee doesn't control where I go
and who I see!

23:24.040 --> 23:26.400
No, that's obvious to everyone.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.640
I'm here because...

23:28.640 --> 23:31.320
Sorry, can you just bring me
up to speed on the conversation?

23:31.320 --> 23:33.840
I was just explaining to
Toby that this whole affair thing is

23:33.840 --> 23:36.680
a big mistake. Is that right?
Yes, it is! Right, good.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.280
So now that's all sorted, let's

23:38.280 --> 23:40.680
forget about the whole thing and
never mention it again.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.680
No offence, Lucy, but you would say
there was no affair, wouldn't you?

23:43.680 --> 23:46.680
Oh, my God! Is this all because of
this ridiculous secret underwear?

23:46.680 --> 23:49.360
Partly, yeah. It's not what you
think. Isn't it?

23:49.360 --> 23:54.360
Then why don't you tell us all who
that underwear was intended for?

23:54.360 --> 23:56.200
For you, of course!

24:01.280 --> 24:03.720
Don't stare at me. This is the first
I've heard of it.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.920
Well, of course it's the first
you've heard of it.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.240
It's all supposed to be a big
surprise for you.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.400
Well, it certainly would have been.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.320
It was supposed to put
a bit of excitement

24:12.320 --> 24:14.280
back into your marriage,
a bit of spice,

24:14.280 --> 24:16.960
get the engines firing again.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.440
Did you know about this?
I don't know anything any more.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.280
Why the hell would you be showing
your underwear to my husband?!

24:23.280 --> 24:26.320
I'm not, you are! I'm showing your
underwear to my husband?!

24:26.320 --> 24:28.600
No, you're showing YOUR underwear
to your husband.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.360
I'm glad no-one can
see MY underwear.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.040
I thought you'd come round to
discuss your affair. MY affair?!

24:35.040 --> 24:37.200
You're the one who's supposed to
be having an affair!

24:37.200 --> 24:38.880
No, I'm not, you are! Who told you
that?!

24:38.880 --> 24:41.520
He did! No, he didn't! He told Lee
that YOU were having an affair!

24:41.520 --> 24:43.680
I didn't tell him anything,
HE told ME!

24:43.680 --> 24:45.680
How would Lee know I'm
having an affair?

24:45.680 --> 24:47.000
So you are having one?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.200
Oh, my God, YOU'RE having an
affair!

24:49.200 --> 24:52.000
Of course I'm not!
I am the last to know!

24:52.000 --> 24:54.440
This is like when you found you
were expecting Jack!

24:54.440 --> 24:56.040
Don't be ridiculous!

24:56.040 --> 24:58.880
Everybody knows you're supposed to
wait three months before you

24:58.880 --> 25:02.360
tell anybody you're pregnant!
Not your husband!

25:02.360 --> 25:04.800
We didn't really row!
We made it all up!

25:04.800 --> 25:06.480
There is no affair!

25:06.480 --> 25:09.520
We just didn't want to come
round for dinner!

25:09.520 --> 25:12.560
I beg your pardon We just wanted to
stay in and watch the telly.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.600
That's why
we lied about Molly being ill,

25:14.600 --> 25:16.360
and that's why
we lied about having a row.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.520
And then I lied to you about why
we'd had the row.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.280
Then I lied to you about the lie
I told Toby.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.720
Then I lied to you about the
specifics of the lie I told Toby.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.360
Then I lied to you again about the

25:24.360 --> 25:26.080
lie I told Anna about the lie
I told Toby!

25:26.080 --> 25:27.680
Nobody's having an affair!

25:27.680 --> 25:32.280
We made it all up from the start,
and that is the truth!

25:32.280 --> 25:34.640
So you never did have a big
argument?

25:34.640 --> 25:37.840
Well, we'll be having one very soon,
if that's any consolation.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.200
I'm so very, very sorry, Anna.

25:49.040 --> 25:53.200
I'm sorry, Toby, I couldn't keep it
going any longer.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.840
What You don't think
we fell for any of that, do you?

25:55.840 --> 25:57.680
What are you talking about Come on,

25:57.680 --> 25:59.880
it's the oldest one in the book,
pretending your child

25:59.880 --> 26:02.800
is ill to get out of something you
don't want to do. What, you mean you

26:02.800 --> 26:05.280
knew?! From the moment you rang to
cancel dinner.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.040
That's why we came round to check on
Molly.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.000
We've been winding you up
all evening.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.200
You liars!

26:13.200 --> 26:16.320
Why put us through all of that?
I'll tell you why.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.600
Because I spent all week preparing
for that bloody dinner, and

26:19.600 --> 26:22.880
if you were spoiling our evening,
we were damn well spoiling yours.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.960
So you mean you've known all along?
Yeah.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.160
So you know Lucy's not really having
an affair?

26:27.160 --> 26:30.480
That's right. And you knew about
Anna spending £400 on underwear?

26:32.920 --> 26:34.360
No, I didn't know that.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.640
Before you ask, no,
I'm not having an affair.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.000
Well, I wish you were.
He might have paid for it!

26:41.680 --> 26:45.200
I'm very, very sorry, Anna.
And ashamed.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.080
Good. So you should be.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.560
Don't blame Lucy.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.640
It's not her fault.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.920
She's been under
a lot of pressure recently.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.440
You see, her dad is very seriously
ill. Shut up, Lee! OK.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.720
What are you doing?

27:07.720 --> 27:10.200
Lucy, I am not going through
the night we've just experienced

27:10.200 --> 27:11.960
all for nothing.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.240
We're going to sit and enjoy the
rest of this TV show if it kills us.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.160
Yeah, but it's really late.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.440
Why don't we just
skip to the last episode?

27:19.440 --> 27:22.640
We can't do that - we've got
two episodes left.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.440
Yeah, but...

27:24.440 --> 27:26.440
But what?

27:26.440 --> 27:29.280
I watched one while you
were at the coffee shop with Toby.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.320
Sorry.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.280
I don't mind. Really?

27:35.280 --> 27:37.360
Yeah, I watched that one
yesterday, too.

27:43.480 --> 27:47.160
That'll be from Toby.
I texted him to apologise.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.280
Oh, what does he say?

27:49.280 --> 27:52.880
"So, the policeman did it, hey?
Who'd have guessed."

27:52.880 --> 27:54.800
What?!

27:54.800 --> 27:57.680
Oh... It's from Jackie at work.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.200
# We're not going out

28:04.200 --> 28:06.040
# Not staying in

28:06.040 --> 28:08.840
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

28:08.840 --> 28:11.880
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

28:11.880 --> 28:15.120
# We're not going out
