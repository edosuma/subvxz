Kim? Come here, Kim.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.700
- Come here!
- Help!

01:32.100 --> 01:34.200
Come on!

03:50.100 --> 03:52.000
Sun Quan.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.700
<i> I leave you. </ i></i>

03:58.000 --> 04:00.100
<i> I take our daughter with. </ i></i>

05:40.900 --> 05:43.000
I want out of it.

05:45.700 --> 05:50.300
- It must surely be your damn joke.
- It is not. I will stop.

05:51.500 --> 05:55.700
Max ... I'm tired.
Clubs.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.600
Smoke. Drinking.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.700
Fudge Riet.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.300
I want to be with family.
I love my wife.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.600
- No access tonight.
- We will fucking favor.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.800
- Hands off, you!
- Is my money not good enough?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.900
- How to bullshit!
- Who the hell do you think you are?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
- What about you?
- What is it with <i> you </ i>?</i>

06:31.900 --> 06:34.200
- I will go.
- Zero.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.100
I'm tired.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.900
Ben! He understands.
Come.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.700
Honestly. It is over.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.000
LOS ANGELES PORT

07:05.500 --> 07:07.600
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

07:07.800 --> 07:10.700
Be vigilant!

07:12.200 --> 07:15.000
Move it!

07:15.200 --> 07:17.900
Down on the floor.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.700
Lie still!

07:52.100 --> 07:54.400
Further. Come on.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.700
How, indeed. Come.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.800
Watch your head.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.500
Now you need to bed, Nicholas.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
- Good evening.
<i> - Ã‡a va? </ i></i>

08:30.600 --> 08:34.900
How's it going?
How's my boy behaved?

08:35.100 --> 08:39.299
- He has been so sweet.
- Good. Thank you.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.200
You have not seen me in ten days.
Should not I have a kiss?

08:47.700 --> 08:51.600
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.900
Thanks for your help.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.100
- Go ahead.
- Thank you. Hello, Nicholas.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.000
- Shall we play, Dad?
- Yes.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.800
But I am not an expert.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.200
- I bitches you, Dad.
- Yes.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.400
- It's me, right?
- No, it's me.

09:18.200 --> 09:23.400
- Teach me to fight, Dad.
- You can do it. You are prompt.

09:23.600 --> 09:28.500
- I believe in reality.
- Let's go upstairs.

09:28.700 --> 09:33.700
It's bedtime.
Come. I'm tired.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.700
<i> There is provision of food </ i>
<i> and drinks for you. </ i></i></i>

09:37.900 --> 09:40.400
<i> Please go and fetch it. </ i></i>

09:40.700 --> 09:47.200
<i> Afterwards want immigration </ i>
<i> authorities register you. </ i></i></i>

09:47.400 --> 09:50.300
<i> I repeat: </ i></i>

09:50.500 --> 09:52.800
<i> We the American </ i>
<i> immigration authorities. </ i></i></i>

09:53.000 --> 09:57.700
<i> We have made sure </ i>
<i> for food, drink and clothes ...</ i></i></i>

10:04.600 --> 10:07.000
What about corpses?

10:07.200 --> 10:11.400
Send them to the morgue,
and call the Chinese Embassy.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.800
Come on.
We take care of her.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.900
I am completely exhausted.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.200
- How is she?
- She'll be all right.

10:32.400 --> 10:38.200
I want to take her
home. Just last night.

10:38.400 --> 10:43.400
I turned 52 last week
so I'm old.

10:43.500 --> 10:49.100
I have any trouble with the heart and kidneys.
Now it is shown also angry with the hearing.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.900
We can not simply load her off
at a detention center.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.700
- Why?
- She is 14 years and has suffered much.

10:57.900 --> 11:04.200
She speaks English? No, surely?
What is special about her?

11:04.400 --> 11:09.600
- Can you get it over your heart?
- I've said as heart problems.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.800
Come on.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.600
Yes ... Make sure she comes
to the hearing tomorrow.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.500
And I will not be fired because of this.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.300
I get just a moment with her?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.000
Are you okay?

11:42.600 --> 11:45.800
My name is Cynthia.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.200
Do you speak English?

11:48.400 --> 11:51.000
What is your name?

11:52.500 --> 11:55.600
I take you home.
Is it okay with you?

12:00.100 --> 12:02.500
Well.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.300
- Ben?
- I am here.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.100
Hello, darling.
How are you?

12:40.300 --> 12:43.700
This is Kim.
And it is my husband Ben.

12:43.900 --> 12:49.100
Sit down only.
I missed you.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.500
I go out and make a bath
to you, Kim.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.600
It is chocolate.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.700
Are you better now?

14:35.800 --> 14:38.300
Where are you from, Kim?

14:40.800 --> 14:45.800
Will you not talk to me?
It's alright.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.400
Good night, darling.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.100
- What's wrong, Kim?
- There must be light.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.600
<i> I am with you in your dreams. </ i></i>

14:59.900 --> 15:04.100
- Why can not you speak Chinese?
- My foster parents are Chinese.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.400
Put you to bed.

15:15.500 --> 15:20.400
- You have taken work home with you.
- Yes.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.500
I need it here.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.200
How did it in Dallas?

16:48.400 --> 16:54.700
- Fine. I had to help a friend.
- So I know my husband again.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.500
The mysterious man.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.700
You know I'd rather not
will talk about my work.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.900
I have been
in the restaurant business for twenty years.

17:09.099 --> 17:12.599
It's a different world than yours.

17:13.700 --> 17:19.500
And I have done things
I am not so proud of in life.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.099
I just want to protect my family.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.100
I work with immigration.
I see terrible things every day.

17:32.700 --> 17:37.600
I'm not an idiot.
I know who I married.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.300
A restaurateur from Marseilles.

17:43.100 --> 17:46.000
I've thought about it here
a thousand times.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.100
At one point I stopped
trying to understand it.

17:50.300 --> 17:57.500
Do you know why? Because I know
you better than you know yourself.

17:57.700 --> 18:02.400
You are a wonderful man and has
made about your life for our sake.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.300
You just know
it means everything to me.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.800
- Never leave me.
- I do not either.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.200
I love you.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.200
Welcome to L.A., mr. Quan.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
<i> Works I to find her? </ i></i>

19:25.000 --> 19:28.400
<i> - We'll find her. </ i>
<i> - Is she okay? </ i></i></i>

19:28.600 --> 19:31.800
<i> We do not know yet, sir. </ i></i>

19:33.100 --> 19:35.900
<i> I get Kim back on my way. </ i></i>

19:54.400 --> 20:00.400
Mrs. Archer, They can not just take
an illegal immigrant in custody.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.100
- It's illegal.
- Yes, but when I saw her ...

20:03.300 --> 20:07.100
And your application
for political asylum ...

20:07.300 --> 20:10.600
There is no question
on religious persecution.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.600
Therefore, he just does not stay in the U.S..
Sentence.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.700
Hoggins, it ought to have known.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.900
- She is in danger.
- Why?

20:23.100 --> 20:27.400
- Her mother was killed.
- A Case of Police in Hong Kong.

20:27.600 --> 20:32.000
Contact the authorities over there.
I mourn for deportation.

20:32.300 --> 20:36.400
Mr. Judge ... Give me one week
to prove that I'm right.

20:36.600 --> 20:41.300
It may not suit the government
will not let me watch her.

20:41.500 --> 20:46.500
I need a week.
She is in danger of Hong Kong.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.900
I ask only for a week.

20:57.900 --> 20:58.800
A week.

21:04.500 --> 21:09.400
I have in the U.S.
immigration custody.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.800
I get a phone call.
I have the right to legal counsel.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.900
Have not afford it
Smoking In direct return to China.

22:37.500 --> 22:40.500
<i> Where are you? </ i></i>

22:57.100 --> 23:01.100
So we meet at last.
Do you like Malibu?

23:01.300 --> 23:05.000
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Take a seat.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.200
We lost two "mules".
Heroin jumped into their stomachs.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.000
It happens
when they are not getting enough water to drink.

23:18.200 --> 23:22.600
- I must see a little better for them.
- It's your problem.

23:24.400 --> 23:29.800
<i> Our </ i> problem. I would hate to pay
for something I did not get.</i>

23:30.000 --> 23:32.700
Have you found my girl?

23:32.900 --> 23:37.500
We do business.
2 million U.S. dollars.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.100
Next shipment: 20 million.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.500
And the next batch
coming Wednesday, is not it?

23:47.500 --> 23:50.600
And yes ...
I have found your girl for you.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.400
She came with one of your boats.
Ironic, huh?

24:03.100 --> 24:07.200
Have you touched her?
Have you touched her?

24:08.500 --> 24:11.800
What do you take me for?

24:16.600 --> 24:19.300
You left her
among white people.

24:19.500 --> 24:24.800
She is with a caseworker.
It is better than a detention center.

24:25.900 --> 24:29.500
Do you like not
about white people?

24:29.700 --> 24:33.000
A pleasure to deal
with you, Quan.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.400
<i> Find her. </ i></i>

25:19.800 --> 25:23.600
When I came here, I had to work
in ten years for my freedom.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.300
And it has not changed.

25:26.500 --> 25:31.200
There are still thousands who
are willing to accept slavery.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.400
Be quiet in your policy.
You can probably see, she is sorry.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.800
It is probably not right now
we must talk about it.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.600
Poor child. She is tired.
Slipped up in your room.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.300
Nicholas, you can then go with Kim.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.500
Come on, Kim.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.400
<i> Hurry up a bit. </ i></i>

26:10.600 --> 26:13.200
<i> - There's nothing to see here. </ i>
<i> - Open the door. </ i></i></i>

26:31.500 --> 26:33.800
Father!

26:35.300 --> 26:37.900
Come!

26:58.800 --> 27:01.700
Where is the girl?

27:57.500 --> 28:00.200
<i> Go! The two keep watch. </ I></i>

30:33.100 --> 30:36.100
Nicholas? Nicholas!

31:03.800 --> 31:07.000
Suspects in the murder

31:14.600 --> 31:17.500
- Did you ever?
- No.

31:20.200 --> 31:23.300
- What about my gun?
- It's evidence.

31:25.900 --> 31:28.000
- I suppose.
- Where?

31:28.100 --> 31:31.300
In addition to finding my son.

31:31.500 --> 31:35.100
We'll find Nicholas.
We have people out across the city.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.400
<i> Phone, boss. </ i></i>

31:51.600 --> 31:54.500
<i> worthless pig. </ i>
<i> You let my daughter get away. </ i></i></i>

31:55.600 --> 31:59.800
<i> Get the guy out of the way </ i>
<i> and find my daughter. </ i></i></i>

32:12.100 --> 32:15.900
Go to Chinatown.
Find Andy Wang.

32:18.200 --> 32:22.300
I know it was him
I looked outside the restaurant.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.900
Are you sure
that I should not stay with you?

32:41.200 --> 32:43.700
You are a free man.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.200
I'll find Nicholas.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.700
Shut up, which is empty here.
I want you, baby.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.199
I will miss you.
I will miss you.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.900
- Where is my son? Where is my son?
- I kill you!

35:16.100 --> 35:18.500
<i> Run </ i></i>

35:35.900 --> 35:39.500
<i> Ben, the kids are in the house. </ i>
<i> They're safe. </ i></i></i>

35:39.700 --> 35:43.700
<i> - Nicholas'm fine. </ i>
- Well, Max. I come. Thank you.</i>

35:43.900 --> 35:46.200
- Beware.
<i> - Sure. </ i></i>

35:54.300 --> 35:56.600
- What the hell happened, Ben?
- Where is Nicholas?

35:56.800 --> 35:59.500
He lies and sleeps.
What happened?

36:37.200 --> 36:40.700
- Where is she?
- The little girl? Yonder.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.300
Wake up.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.200
- Kim! Wake up!
- Calm down, man.

36:58.100 --> 37:01.500
Who killed my wife?

37:01.700 --> 37:03.900
Say something.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.900
I heard the shots.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.900
I took hold of Nicholas,
and we ran away. Sorry.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.000
Andy Wang.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.000
Do you know him?
Andy Wang?

37:21.500 --> 37:24.200
Who is after you?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.600
- Sun Quan.
- Who is Sun Quan?

37:29.100 --> 37:33.100
- Say something now.
- He has followed me.

37:33.300 --> 37:36.300
He hit my mom to death.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.400
Did he kill my wife?

37:54.200 --> 37:58.300
- Why did my wife you home?
- Stop it, Ben.

38:00.900 --> 38:03.800
It's not my fault!

38:10.700 --> 38:13.600
Why he killed my mother?

38:14.700 --> 38:17.100
Dad?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.700
Where's Mom?

38:28.300 --> 38:31.100
She's dead, my baby.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.900
Ben ... Tony has come.

39:15.800 --> 39:19.900
- Do you know anything of Wang?
- The Chinese Triads.

39:22.100 --> 39:26.700
He owns a horehus in town
and keep your there.

39:28.100 --> 39:32.200
I have it from a prostitute,
coming into the club.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.200
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.400
Let's run there.

39:41.700 --> 39:45.100
Let us take care of Wang ... now.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.300
- Take with Raymond.
- Raymond, stay with Max.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.800
Max, if something happens ...

39:54.600 --> 39:57.900
... As Nicholas is your son.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.500
Raymond, download guns.

40:49.300 --> 40:51.600
It is her.

40:58.100 --> 41:01.300
- Hello, darling.
- He's upstairs. Bedroom 107th

41:01.500 --> 41:03.800
Thank you.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.100
Down with you!
See the devil to come down!

41:47.300 --> 41:52.200
Down! Down! Down on the floor!

41:52.400 --> 41:55.000
And stay down there!

43:12.700 --> 43:16.000
<i> Move, bitch! </ i></i>

43:16.200 --> 43:18.300
Down!

43:18.500 --> 43:20.700
Stay current!

43:39.600 --> 43:41.800
<i> Keep </ i></i>

44:20.600 --> 44:23.700
<i> Get me out! Give me the gun! </ I></i>

44:45.000 --> 44:47.300
Who the hell are you?

44:51.100 --> 44:55.300
- It's for my wife.
- Fuck my ass!

45:22.500 --> 45:27.000
Hoggins? What are you doing here?
It is not your board.

45:27.200 --> 45:32.500
It may be related
with the murder of Cynthia Archer.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.900
Have you any ideas?

45:35.100 --> 45:38.400
Two men in balaclavas.
No fingerprints.

45:38.600 --> 45:43.700
Professional work.
What a day it has been.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.500
Keep me informed, right?

46:34.100 --> 46:38.000
We have a problem.
Andy Wang is dead.

46:39.300 --> 46:44.800
Your small number of Mama Lis
restaurant did not improve.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.400
The Chinese embassy cremated
no corpses, so they find heroin.

46:50.600 --> 46:54.500
In other words, the whole shit.

46:54.700 --> 46:56.900
I expose our agreement.

46:58.500 --> 47:01.900
The only
be deferred in life is death.

47:02.200 --> 47:07.000
Spare me your bullshit oriental.
You threaten me?

47:08.900 --> 47:12.200
If it feels such
As is the case.

47:12.400 --> 47:16.300
I'm not in the mood
of Chinese puzzles.

47:16.500 --> 47:21.500
We are not on the contract.
I need money on Wednesday.

47:22.600 --> 47:28.500
Shit ... You are just so icy.
Do not you think we have problems?

47:28.700 --> 47:33.100
We run a quiet and peaceful
small smuggling enterprise --

47:33.300 --> 47:36.600
- And now you've made it on
for a gangster movie.

47:36.800 --> 47:41.900
One man goes into your horehus
and kills three of your people.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
It is a problem.

47:44.200 --> 47:47.800
Police believe
that it was Ben Archer.

47:49.100 --> 47:54.400
You have killed Ben Archer's wife,
then we have problems to hell.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.500
It is too late.

47:57.700 --> 48:01.700
You can not back out of it now.

49:08.400 --> 49:12.100
<i> Ben, you will have a cup of coffee? </ i></i>

49:13.800 --> 49:16.600
Yes.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.400
How do we now Sun Quan?

49:20.600 --> 49:23.800
We must first find out
who the hell he is.

49:31.600 --> 49:35.400
We should be talking with hoggins.
With immigration authorities.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.900
He must know something.

49:51.900 --> 49:55.500
<i> - What do you want? </ i>
- Can you still do a damn thing English?</i>

49:55.600 --> 49:58.700
- Ben?
- Yes.

50:15.600 --> 50:18.300
Hello, Max.

50:30.600 --> 50:33.700
- I knew you were here.
<i> - A cup of coffee, Raymond. </ i></i>

50:52.700 --> 50:55.900
What happened
home with you last night?

50:56.600 --> 50:58.700
I smashed a window by accident.

50:58.900 --> 51:03.100
- And the shooting on the street ..?
- An accident.

51:15.700 --> 51:20.300
You were not at a brothel
at 3rd Street last night, right?

51:21.400 --> 51:25.600
- No.
- And you were in the club, not Tony?

51:26.400 --> 51:29.400
Jo.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.100
Well, ...

51:40.200 --> 51:44.700
Two gangsters shot a guy
named Andy Wang.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.700
They had balaclavas on.

51:49.900 --> 51:53.000
We know they are white.

52:01.700 --> 52:04.600
But anyway ... I fucking care.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.800
He was a drug dealer and pimp.

52:20.400 --> 52:23.000
When I got there,
there was total chaos.

52:23.200 --> 52:28.200
Hoggins from immigration
the authorities were there.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.600
- Hoggins?
- Yes.

52:35.500 --> 52:38.100
The I can not really gear.

52:40.800 --> 52:43.900
I find out for yourself.

52:49.700 --> 52:53.300
You are always welcome
to drop.

53:06.500 --> 53:09.100
<i> Are you back? </ i></i>

53:13.600 --> 53:17.400
<i> I have to find out </ i>
<i> who did it against the mother. </ i></i></i>

53:19.100 --> 53:24.200
<i> - Do not go. </ i>
<i> - Nicholas ... Now you must be strong. </ I></i></i>

53:27.700 --> 53:30.600
<i> I come back. I promise. </ I></i>

53:30.800 --> 53:35.300
<i> I come back, Nicholas. </ i>
<i> You know. </ i></i></i>

54:36.300 --> 54:38.200
What are you doing?

55:46.800 --> 55:49.000
What the hell are you up to?

55:54.200 --> 55:56.400
Who killed my wife?

55:58.900 --> 56:01.400
Who is Sun Quan?

56:03.100 --> 56:05.400
Who killed my wife?

56:08.700 --> 56:11.700
Who is Sun Quan?
Where is he?

56:15.600 --> 56:21.100
Do you know what we do with such
some pigs like you in Marseille?

56:21.900 --> 56:24.600
I do not know
who killed your wife --

56:24.800 --> 56:27.700
- And who the hell is Sun Quan.

56:27.900 --> 56:30.100
Inform.

56:34.500 --> 56:36.400
Max ...

56:37.500 --> 56:40.100
- Get him to say something.
- Raymond!

56:42.200 --> 56:44.500
<i> Figures </ i></i>

56:45.800 --> 56:49.300
<i> Now you say something! Confess </ i></i>

56:50.900 --> 56:52.900
It is Da Costa at the morgue.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.400
I am investigating some deaths
Cynthia among immigrants.

56:56.600 --> 56:59.500
<i> it here, you see. </ i></i>

56:59.700 --> 57:03.000
<i> - I come. </ i>
- I'm waiting for you.</i>

57:10.000 --> 57:12.300
There has been no major op.

57:12.500 --> 57:16.400
- Police ...
- You, Tony ...

57:16.600 --> 57:21.700
- He will call the police.
- Then plug him a coin.

57:21.900 --> 57:24.700
Max ... Finish the job.

57:41.900 --> 57:44.200
Come back, come back ...

57:44.500 --> 57:47.000
We need you.
Do not slip away from us.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.800
Can you hear me? Listen carefully.

57:51.700 --> 57:53.900
Where we find the fucking Chinese?

57:54.800 --> 57:59.700
- What are you doing with Sun Quan?
- Heroin ...

57:59.900 --> 58:03.500
Heroin?
You smuggle that shit into the country?

58:03.700 --> 58:06.500
Kick the pig to death! Drilled, Raymond!

58:10.200 --> 58:13.400
- Son of a bitch!
<i> - Now spit you out! </ i></i>

58:13.600 --> 58:16.800
<i> confession, I said: </ i>
<i> You will bleed! </ i></i></i>

58:20.000 --> 58:22.500
Fucking asshole!

58:22.700 --> 58:26.500
Why did the damn thing my niece killed?

58:26.700 --> 58:31.200
This is the girl.
She is the daughter of Sun Quan.

58:31.400 --> 58:34.300
Where the hell knew he was from,
where she was?

58:34.500 --> 58:37.700
- Did you tell him?
<i> - Admit I've said </ i></i>

58:38.000 --> 58:41.600
Fucking asshole!
Take his knees.

58:44.400 --> 58:47.500
Your pig!
Your fucking shit!

58:48.500 --> 58:50.600
Ah, shit!

58:50.800 --> 58:54.400
Big boy. Do you like it?
It is sovereign.

58:54.600 --> 58:59.900
Now you tell me where the hell
I find the pig to Sun Quan.

59:00.100 --> 59:02.800
- Down by the harbor.
- By the port.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.400
When in port? Let us know.

59:05.600 --> 59:09.900
- Kaj 19th
- What the fuck is at berth 19?

59:10.000 --> 59:14.200
- "Katrina". A boat.
- Your stupid bitch!

59:14.400 --> 59:18.500
Your fucking Chinaman and your heroin
has turned my niece Cynthia death!

59:18.700 --> 59:21.600
You need a shelter.

59:21.900 --> 59:24.500
Raymond!
Living his fucking head off.

59:35.300 --> 59:37.100
Raymond ... Clean up.

59:52.700 --> 59:55.200
Tony ... A message to Ben:

59:55.400 --> 59:59.700
Kaj 19th "Katrina". Tonight.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.200
Sorry, but who am I?

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.400
No, do not!

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.800
Do not kill me!

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.200
- When running the go?
- On the road!

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.800
Leave me alone!

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.800
Help!

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.800
Max? Raymond?

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.200
Max? Max?

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.600
Raymond? Max!

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.000
Let me go!

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.100
Kim? Come on, Kim! Come here!

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.700
- Help!

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.800
<i> We lost Kim, </ i>
<i> but we have his son. </ i></i></i>

<i> I get there. </ i>
<i> Take him home. </ i></i></i>

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.600
Should I go with you?

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.399
No.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.700
Tonight I download Nicholas.

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:27.300
- Simply.
- You can not cope with Sun Quan alone.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.500
Are you okay?

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.100
- I can not sleep.
- We need to get Nicholas I tonight.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.200
I know.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.500
Do not be afraid.

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.800
Get ready, my friend.
I must speak with Tony.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.400
Kim ...

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.700
Come here.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:15.100
Sun Quan ... is your dad.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.000
No.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.200
- He may not be my father!
- Let be.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.500
I'm coming with you.
And that's flat.

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:36.200
- I will not lose you.
- You do not.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.900
I would sacrifice my life for you.
I would.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.900
You are my brother.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.500
- Tony? Are you ready?
<i> - I'm in position. </ i></i>

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.000
Tony ... thanks.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.200
Kim. So we go.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.900
Come here.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.300
Take it here for you.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:52.700
I'm not back in twenty minutes
call the police.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:57.400
Okay? Come here.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.800

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.100

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.900
Sun Quan! I'm coming after you!

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:35.000

- Huh?
- Dad!

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.600
Huh?

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.100
<i> Dad? </ i></i>

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.000
