WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:02.299
- Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>
- I have this thing,

00:02.302 --> 00:03.802
where I can't remember anything

00:03.870 --> 00:06.371
that happened, like,
more than a month ago.

00:06.739 --> 00:09.106
I want to see if Nina can help
you retrieve some memory

00:09.175 --> 00:10.909
that your brain has,
for whatever reason,

00:10.977 --> 00:12.310
buried away.

00:12.377 --> 00:14.280
Is there anyone
there with you?

00:14.347 --> 00:15.638
There's a woman.

00:15.706 --> 00:18.323
I think she's my mother.

00:18.391 --> 00:20.823
Can no longer send
an untrained,

00:20.891 --> 00:23.723
and undisciplined, civilian
into the field.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.416
Quantico's FBI Academy.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.951
- Oh, thank you!
- All right.

00:27.018 --> 00:29.987
You know, Parish somehow
managed to coerce Senator Burton

00:30.055 --> 00:32.116
to fast-track this photostim
through the F.D.A.

00:32.183 --> 00:34.115
Every August Medical
photostim

00:34.183 --> 00:36.114
has been recalled and destroyed.
Good.

00:36.181 --> 00:38.013
Make sure every import ban
is retroactive.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.581
Of course.

00:39.649 --> 00:41.216
We're finished.

00:41.284 --> 00:42.250
Charlotte,

00:42.318 --> 00:44.452
go home.

00:44.519 --> 00:47.254
I've pushed the senator too far.

00:47.322 --> 00:48.422
Her doctor needs
these brain scans.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.658
Look, Nina,
it's risky.

00:50.725 --> 00:52.592
A senator has
a lot of resources.

00:52.660 --> 00:54.494
She could find you.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.604
Unh!

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.549 --> 01:19.051
What's your
relationship to Parish?

01:19.119 --> 01:20.286
Unh!

01:20.354 --> 01:24.457
Let's go, let's go!

01:24.524 --> 01:26.359
Oh!

01:26.427 --> 01:29.195
Aah.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.963
Aah.

01:31.031 --> 01:33.233
Do you know
Parish's location?

01:37.472 --> 01:40.408
Clear!
We're clear!

01:40.475 --> 01:42.143
Can you think back
to the last

01:42.210 --> 01:44.211
time you saw Parish?

02:06.301 --> 02:08.769
Relax.

02:08.836 --> 02:09.836
And tell me
what I need to know.

02:09.904 --> 02:12.272
Look at me.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.473
Tell me the truth.

02:13.541 --> 02:15.108
Do you know Parish's location?

02:15.176 --> 02:16.443
Who else is involved?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.045
What's Parish planning?

02:18.112 --> 02:22.349
When's the last time
you saw him?

02:22.417 --> 02:25.486
Fresh leads.
Take a look.

02:25.553 --> 02:29.023
Any insight from you
will help us, uh, prioritize.

02:29.091 --> 02:31.125
Nathan, don't you think
this approach

02:31.193 --> 02:32.360
is a scattershot, really?

02:32.427 --> 02:33.661
We're hitting
the Parish organization

02:33.729 --> 02:34.895
from every angle.

02:34.963 --> 02:36.731
We've got analysts
working 24/7.

02:36.799 --> 02:39.667
We've got all the resources
we could want.

02:39.735 --> 02:41.602
This place is like
the friggin' bin Laden desk now.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.438
Yeah, and that took ten years.

02:43.505 --> 02:44.706
But we got him.

02:55.018 --> 02:56.151
Anything jump out?

02:56.219 --> 02:57.286
Uh, no.

02:57.354 --> 03:00.556
No, uh, not at the moment.
Sorry.

03:00.624 --> 03:03.392
There's more where
that came from.

03:10.333 --> 03:14.437
Cameron, there's
a farmhouse at this address.

03:14.505 --> 03:16.473
If there's anything there that
can lead us to Parish,

03:16.540 --> 03:18.141
we need to get to it...

03:18.209 --> 03:19.442
before the investigation.

03:19.510 --> 03:21.378
So you don't trust
Cley's people?

03:21.445 --> 03:23.880
No, I don't.

03:23.948 --> 03:28.986
We both know how Parish
can twist people's loyalties.

03:29.053 --> 03:31.789
Okay.

03:31.857 --> 03:34.291
The place is only
a few hours away.

03:34.359 --> 03:35.726
As much as I'd like
to go with you,

03:35.794 --> 03:37.662
I'm afraid my sudden departure
from here

03:37.729 --> 03:40.164
would garner more attention
than I'd like.

03:40.232 --> 03:42.466
But you will, however,
need some backup.

03:42.534 --> 03:43.567
Someone who won't be missed.

03:43.635 --> 03:45.035
Yes!

03:45.103 --> 03:46.870
It's my first recon mission.
Mm.

03:46.938 --> 03:48.702
Uh, yay, high five.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.637
- Um--
- yes!

03:50.705 --> 03:51.838
But there's
a little more involved

03:51.905 --> 03:53.270
than just reconnaissance, Kat.

03:53.338 --> 03:55.136
Okay. All ears.

03:55.204 --> 03:57.071
Quantico-trained ears.

03:57.138 --> 03:58.705
Mr. Hicks is grieving.

03:58.773 --> 04:01.873
So I'm counting on you to keep
him focused on the task at hand.

04:01.941 --> 04:02.973
Yeah, of course.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.140
Dr. Rosen.

04:04.207 --> 04:05.808
The factory in China,

04:05.876 --> 04:07.176
the one that made
the photic stimulators...

04:07.244 --> 04:08.376
- Yeah.
- For Stanton Parish?

04:08.444 --> 04:09.811
They ju--I just got a ping.

04:09.879 --> 04:11.679
They exported something
to New York.

04:11.747 --> 04:13.982
But I-I don't know what it was.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.821
But Senator Burton
shut down August Medical.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.125
Oh, yeah, no, but it's
not August Medical anymore.

04:18.192 --> 04:21.095
Gary, will you try and
discover what's been exported?

04:21.163 --> 04:23.634
I, yeah, no,
I was gonna do that anyway.

04:23.702 --> 04:25.303
That's--even if
you didn't ask me.

04:25.370 --> 04:27.605
That's my hot lead.

04:27.673 --> 04:29.073
Oh, Bill?
Yeah.

04:29.141 --> 04:30.943
Can you give me a ride
to the hospital after work?

04:31.010 --> 04:33.480
Gary, why do you need
to go to the hospital?

04:33.548 --> 04:35.417
Oh, 'cause my mom
was in a car accident.

04:41.124 --> 04:42.625
Okay, first
post-Quantico mission,

04:42.692 --> 04:43.893
and I'm totally psyched.

04:43.961 --> 04:46.629
Again with
the video diary.

04:46.696 --> 04:48.197
I'm all geared up.

04:48.265 --> 04:50.466
I've got guns, tech gear,
snacks, and I've memorized

04:50.534 --> 04:52.935
the topography within
a 50-mile radius.

04:53.003 --> 04:55.271
They're leaving.

04:55.339 --> 04:57.773
Unsub leaving the premises.

04:57.841 --> 04:59.742
Matches profile described
by locals.

04:59.810 --> 05:01.210
Total badass.

05:01.278 --> 05:03.379
Loner, ex-military type.
I'm forced to make an evaluation

05:03.447 --> 05:06.349
by eye 'cause Hicks is bogarting
the binoculars that I brought.

05:06.417 --> 05:08.751
All right.

05:08.819 --> 05:12.788
Let's see what's
so special about this place.

05:22.366 --> 05:25.967
Remember to check
your danger areas upon entry.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.284
Show me your hands!
Right now.

06:19.654 --> 06:21.221
Oh.

06:21.289 --> 06:22.723
Did I...

06:22.790 --> 06:24.257
Did I ever tell you about
the time I met John McEnroe?

06:24.325 --> 06:25.625
In Malibu, on the beach.

06:25.693 --> 06:27.227
He--he's a lot nicer
than you'd think.

06:27.295 --> 06:28.962
We--we still keep in touch.

06:29.030 --> 06:30.997
What?

06:31.065 --> 06:32.432
I liberated Buchenwald!

06:32.499 --> 06:34.267
All right, not--
not all by myself.

06:34.335 --> 06:36.136
And if you guys are hungry,
I-I can whip up

06:36.204 --> 06:37.304
a little something.
I studied, uh,

06:37.372 --> 06:40.107
at Cordon Bleu.
La cuisine salon.

06:40.175 --> 06:44.144
Hey, what's your name?

06:44.212 --> 06:47.814
Your name!
Uh, uh, Mitchell.

06:47.882 --> 06:49.683
Okay, Mitchell.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.518
Now why are you locked
in this room?

06:51.585 --> 06:54.788
I have to be here.
I'm--I'm very important.

06:54.856 --> 06:57.690
Yeah? Says who?

06:57.758 --> 07:01.628
Um...Stanton Parish.

So, the scale
in the bathroom

07:42.135 --> 07:44.036
is broken, and there's
a butt load of empty

07:44.104 --> 07:46.339
milk cartons in the trash,
but besides that...

07:46.407 --> 07:47.775
only thing out of the ordinary
is this guy.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.310
First time I saw the boss

07:49.378 --> 07:50.878
was spring of '72
at the Stone Pony.

07:50.946 --> 07:52.515
The Boss?
What do you mean, Parish?

07:52.582 --> 07:53.785
Springsteen.

07:53.852 --> 07:55.454
The guy still puts on
a hell of a show.

07:55.522 --> 07:58.291
Pretty sure this dude's cheese
has slid off his cracker.

07:58.359 --> 07:59.926
Did I tell you that
I burst in on Mitchell

07:59.994 --> 08:02.231
with a gun in my hand and
a cute blonde at my side?

08:02.299 --> 08:03.733
Wait a minute, that wasn't you,
that was me.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.334
What do you mean,
"at my side"?

08:05.402 --> 08:06.869
Since when did
I turn into Tonto?

08:06.937 --> 08:08.705
If Parish is keeping
him locked

08:08.773 --> 08:10.907
in that farmhouse,

08:10.975 --> 08:12.275
he must be important.

08:12.343 --> 08:13.710
Hey, Hicks.

08:13.778 --> 08:16.045
That massive jailer dude
could be back at any time.

08:16.113 --> 08:17.447
Yeah, Doc, we gotta move.

08:17.515 --> 08:19.916
Bring him in quickly.
And quietly.

08:19.984 --> 08:21.217
All right.

08:21.284 --> 08:23.552
Let's go.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.686
I don't have my keys.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.821
Have you seen my keys?

08:28.124 --> 08:29.191
Dr. Rosen.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.592
Senator Charlotte Burton.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.361
I'll be acting as the senate

08:32.428 --> 08:35.097
liaison to the Parish
task force.

08:35.164 --> 08:36.532
Yes, of course.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.866
Uh, please, come in.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.068
Thank you.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.202
A lead?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.871
Uh, one of hundreds.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.741
We're literally drowning
in leads.

08:52.315 --> 08:54.450
Senator?

08:54.517 --> 08:55.751
Yes.

08:55.819 --> 08:57.286
My question to you,

08:57.353 --> 08:58.720
where is Parish vulnerable?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.989
What are his weaknesses?

09:01.057 --> 09:04.360
Well, if--if he has any,
he's, uh, he's playing them

09:04.428 --> 09:06.529
very close to his vest.
Don't we all?

09:06.597 --> 09:10.900
But everyone has
an Achilles' heel, Dr. Rosen.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.269
Now, I'd like
to be brought up to speed.

09:13.337 --> 09:15.071
Uh, yes.
Yes, of course.

09:15.139 --> 09:16.439
Let me show you
to the conference room.

09:16.507 --> 09:19.943
Uh, Dr. Rosen...

09:20.011 --> 09:22.480
I know what you did.

09:22.548 --> 09:24.649
I asked around about
your research,

09:24.717 --> 09:26.184
and I don't think
those medical files

09:26.252 --> 09:27.652
could have come
from anywhere else.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.821
If those brain scans hadn't

09:29.889 --> 09:31.656
found their way
to my neurologist,

09:31.724 --> 09:34.026
I'm not sure
I'd be here today.

09:34.093 --> 09:36.828
I owe you my life.

09:36.896 --> 09:38.430
Nina, you went behind
my back,

09:38.498 --> 09:39.898
and provided her with
a paper trail

09:39.966 --> 09:41.633
which she has followed
directly to me.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.935
I saved her.

09:44.003 --> 09:45.971
Lee, I know you.

09:46.038 --> 09:48.240
You don't want her blood
on our hands.

09:48.308 --> 09:50.409
It's not her blood
I'm concerned about.

09:50.477 --> 09:54.313
It's if--when she puts
the pieces together,

09:54.380 --> 09:58.417
you and I could go to jail.

09:58.484 --> 09:59.518
Send her home.

09:59.585 --> 10:01.820
Push her?

10:01.888 --> 10:03.088
But I don't know what
that would do to her.

10:03.156 --> 10:05.057
We have other concerns
right now.

10:05.124 --> 10:09.295
So, what, she's
an acceptable casualty?

10:09.362 --> 10:11.030
All right, then you leave.

10:11.098 --> 10:13.098
I'm in the middle
of interrogations right now.

10:13.166 --> 10:16.169
We don't know if her seeing
you is gonna trigger her memory,

10:16.236 --> 10:19.172
and that's a risk
I'm not willing to take.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.007
Now, as soon as I can figure
out a way to move her

10:21.075 --> 10:22.609
off the investigation,
I will let you know.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.583
Bill,
I don't like it here.

10:29.651 --> 10:31.351
I-I don't--last time
I was in a hospital,

10:31.419 --> 10:32.986
I lost Anna again.

10:33.054 --> 10:33.887
I don't--I don't want
to stay here.

10:33.954 --> 10:35.121
I understand, Gary.

10:35.189 --> 10:37.023
Look, no one likes hospitals,
okay?

10:37.091 --> 10:38.291
- Yeah, I know.
- Including your mother.

10:38.359 --> 10:40.260
No, no, they--
she's still in surgery, okay?

10:40.328 --> 10:42.295
Yeah, so--yeah,
she's unconscious, then.

10:42.363 --> 10:43.663
She doesn't even know
that I'm here.

10:43.731 --> 10:45.432
Come on,
let's go back to the office.

10:45.499 --> 10:46.633
- No, okay?
- Come on, Bill.

10:46.701 --> 10:47.768
I have a hot lead.
All right, well,

10:47.835 --> 10:48.869
then work from here.
I can't-

10:48.937 --> 10:49.936
No, Bill!
I can't work from here.

10:50.004 --> 10:51.104
- Gar--
- I don't like it.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.305
We've been
over this already.

10:52.373 --> 10:53.407
Gary, will you
please chill, okay?

10:53.474 --> 10:54.674
I'm-no, I don't want
to chill.

10:54.742 --> 10:55.776
Gary, just chill and have
a seat, please.

10:55.843 --> 10:56.743
I don't want
to chill out, Bill.

11:03.284 --> 11:04.418
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

11:04.485 --> 11:06.553
I just--

11:06.621 --> 11:08.788
I've been up half the night

11:08.856 --> 11:11.324
with Jeannie,
driving Adam around.

11:11.391 --> 11:13.526
Oh. But he's a baby.

11:13.594 --> 11:15.027
He doesn't have anywhere to go.

11:15.095 --> 11:16.229
No, I know.

11:16.296 --> 11:18.197
I could--I--

11:18.265 --> 11:20.099
oh, no, that's it, Bill.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.234
I found it.

11:22.403 --> 11:23.603
The shipment that arrives in

11:23.671 --> 11:24.704
New York from Stanton Parish's
factory.

11:24.772 --> 11:25.839
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

11:25.907 --> 11:27.074
This is it, the manifest.

11:27.141 --> 11:29.009
It says
"industrial electronics."

11:29.077 --> 11:30.110
That's it.
We're gonna need

11:30.178 --> 11:31.611
more details, okay?
Yeah.

11:31.679 --> 11:32.913
- Anything on the factory?
- Yeah, it's all here, Bill.

11:32.981 --> 11:34.482
But I-I can't read it.
Neither can you.

11:34.549 --> 11:37.018
It's all in Chinese.

11:37.086 --> 11:41.390
I was calm as we approached
the farmhouse,

11:41.458 --> 11:45.528
sliding into danger as if it
were a pair of fuzzy slippers.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.700
Hicks, however, was a wreck.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.435
Reeked of fear.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.804
And the breakfast burrito
he ate a couple of hours ago.

11:53.872 --> 11:57.107
I was calm as we approached
the farmhouse.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.676
Come on, Hicks.

11:58.743 --> 12:00.845
Why don't we talk anymore?
We used to talk.

12:00.912 --> 12:03.647
Did we have some torrid sexual
affair I'm not remembering,

12:03.715 --> 12:05.182
or, what's the deal?

12:05.249 --> 12:06.483
You want to talk about sex,
I was stationed

12:06.551 --> 12:07.684
in the Philippines
in the second World War.

12:07.752 --> 12:08.818
If you two don't
shut the hell up,

12:08.886 --> 12:10.353
I swear to God
I will crash this car

12:10.421 --> 12:13.924
and I will kill us all.
You got it?

12:13.991 --> 12:17.994
Look, I'm sorry about Dani.

12:18.062 --> 12:19.162
If you want to talk about--

12:19.230 --> 12:22.700
I don't.

12:22.768 --> 12:25.203
Dani is dead.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.605
I'm responsible for her death.
I-I killed Dani.

12:27.673 --> 12:28.740
What the hell did you say?

12:40.120 --> 12:42.821
Hicks, do something!

12:42.889 --> 12:44.857
Unh!

12:50.664 --> 12:52.598
He's dead.

12:52.666 --> 12:55.768
Yeah, so is the car.

12:55.835 --> 12:57.069
Come on.

12:57.137 --> 12:58.504
We gotta get off the road.

12:58.572 --> 13:00.172
If that guy called
for back up, we're in trouble.

13:16.224 --> 13:18.058
Unh!

13:28.573 --> 13:30.644
- We've gotta call Rosen.
- We're out of cell range.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.827
We're too far off the grid.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.196
I...I don't have my keys.

13:34.264 --> 13:35.731
I-I can't find my keys.

13:35.799 --> 13:37.166
You don't have any keys.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.133
People locked in rooms
aren't usually given keys.

13:38.201 --> 13:39.301
Am I going home soon?

13:39.369 --> 13:41.036
No, you're not
going home soon!

13:41.104 --> 13:43.539
Look, we need to keep moving.
There could be a battalion of...

13:43.606 --> 13:45.007
- No! You are gonna tell me...
- Badasses after us.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.009
How you are responsible
for Dani's death.

13:47.077 --> 13:50.779
And then I put my gun
on Mitchell, and--and--

13:50.847 --> 13:52.181
and the prisoner
looked really scared.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.083
Hicks, you can't shoot
the prisoner.

13:54.150 --> 13:55.817
They didn't exactly teach
us that at the academy,

13:55.885 --> 13:57.252
but it was totally implied.
Well I didn't go to the

13:57.320 --> 13:59.888
academy, so you tell
me about Dani.

13:59.956 --> 14:02.090
About Dani.

14:07.062 --> 14:09.163
I, um, wanted
to be straight with you.

14:09.231 --> 14:11.565
I want to be with him.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.367
I appreciate your candor.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.502
You deserve to be happy,

14:15.570 --> 14:17.838
as does Mr. Hicks.

14:20.275 --> 14:21.575
Don't you ever
do that to me again!

14:21.643 --> 14:22.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What just happened?

14:22.644 --> 14:23.877
He just put me with Dani.

14:23.945 --> 14:25.845
I'm not following, Hicks.

14:25.913 --> 14:26.946
It was like it was
in a memory, all right?

14:27.014 --> 14:28.114
But it wasn't mine!

14:28.182 --> 14:32.352
Okay, then whose memory
was it?

14:32.420 --> 14:34.788
I got a pretty good idea.

14:34.856 --> 14:38.859
Gary's list from
the factory, translated.

14:38.927 --> 14:41.495
All the industrial electronics
have basically the same

14:41.563 --> 14:42.997
components as the photostim.

14:43.065 --> 14:45.333
The one used on Jason and me.

14:45.401 --> 14:46.635
So Parish is still looking
for a way

14:46.702 --> 14:47.836
to amplify Alpha abilities.

14:47.904 --> 14:50.805
Apparently so.

14:50.873 --> 14:52.374
It's critical
we intercept the shipment

14:52.441 --> 14:56.311
before it gets to Parish.

14:56.379 --> 15:00.682
I was gonna walk back
to the office.

15:00.749 --> 15:03.417
But Google maps said that it--

15:03.485 --> 15:06.687
it would take
3 hours, 18 minutes.

15:06.755 --> 15:08.355
I'm not built for that.
No, you're not.

15:08.423 --> 15:11.892
I imagine this is pretty hard
for you, huh?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.293
Yeah.

15:13.361 --> 15:15.662
You know what this is like?
Remember--

15:15.730 --> 15:17.231
remember when you had Adam?

15:17.298 --> 15:19.800
And he's just
a helpless little baby?

15:19.868 --> 15:21.134
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

15:21.202 --> 15:22.469
- It wasn't even that long ago.
- Yeah.

15:22.537 --> 15:23.604
I've got a good memory, Bill.

15:23.671 --> 15:24.972
- Well...
- I'm not a cat.

15:25.039 --> 15:27.041
Well, that's exactly
how your mother feels, okay?

15:27.108 --> 15:30.511
So, it's your turn
to look after her.

15:30.579 --> 15:32.680
It's only right, partner.
All right?

15:32.748 --> 15:34.682
All right?

15:34.750 --> 15:37.485
Yeah, Harken.

15:37.553 --> 15:38.986
Okay.

15:39.054 --> 15:40.722
I'll be right there.

15:40.789 --> 15:41.923
Gary, I've got
to go back to the office.

15:41.990 --> 15:43.791
That was Rosen.

15:43.859 --> 15:48.129
I'll be back as soon as I can.
You okay?

15:48.197 --> 15:52.167
Gary, are you okay?

15:53.570 --> 15:56.839
That's--that's good.

15:56.907 --> 15:58.641
You okay?

15:58.709 --> 16:00.010
How does he do that, huh?

16:00.077 --> 16:01.778
Put me in someone else's memory?

16:01.846 --> 16:03.113
Well, I'm guessing
he's an Alpha.

16:03.181 --> 16:04.615
Oh, really, you think?

16:04.683 --> 16:07.184
Hey, can you mess with
the cortisol levels

16:07.252 --> 16:09.720
in people's hippocampus?
Because that would totally

16:09.788 --> 16:12.156
affect people's
memory reconsolidation.

16:12.224 --> 16:14.158
I'm lactose intolerant.

16:14.226 --> 16:15.660
I mean, once slice
of cheese and look out.

16:15.727 --> 16:17.294
Yep.

16:17.362 --> 16:18.863
I don't think he would
understand what you were saying,

16:18.930 --> 16:19.997
even if you did say
it in English.

16:20.065 --> 16:21.431
Would you like me--

16:21.499 --> 16:23.433
Yeah, I'd love to hear it
in English, thank you.

16:23.501 --> 16:25.001
So,
he touches you, right?

16:25.069 --> 16:27.237
And zap, he records whatever
memory you're thinking about.

16:27.304 --> 16:28.938
And then he touches you later,

16:29.006 --> 16:32.708
and he put you back in, only
in HD smell-and-touch-o-vision.

16:32.776 --> 16:36.278
Isn't that right, Mitch?
Uh, right.

16:36.346 --> 16:37.879
So he's
a <i>Total Recall</i> Alpha.

16:37.947 --> 16:40.215
- I don't--
- It's a movie.

16:40.282 --> 16:42.183
Okay, I'll put it
at the top of my queue.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.186
Look, I'm guessing he can put
you back in any memory

16:45.254 --> 16:46.420
he's got stored in his head.

16:46.488 --> 16:49.256
Doesn't even have
to be your own.

16:49.324 --> 16:52.793
Pretty cool toy
to keep around.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.761
So if he's holding
Parish's memories,

16:54.829 --> 16:58.231
he must be
a mountain of intel.

17:41.265 --> 17:42.365
I'm good for it.

17:48.538 --> 17:50.339
We're still out of cell range.

17:50.407 --> 17:52.541
I memorized the cell coverage
in this area.

17:52.609 --> 17:55.645
You're not gonna get squat until
we get back into town.

17:55.712 --> 17:57.046
Okay, well which is
the quickest way to town?

17:57.114 --> 17:58.214
Is it this way?

17:58.282 --> 17:59.582
No, the quickest way is

17:59.650 --> 18:01.484
to flag a car down
and flash our badges, but--

18:01.552 --> 18:03.152
Under the radar, Kat.

18:03.220 --> 18:04.988
No badge-flashing, huh?

18:05.055 --> 18:06.689
No having to explain
to the local sheriff

18:06.757 --> 18:08.024
why we killed a man,
or why we've got this

18:08.092 --> 18:09.893
babbling idiot in cuffs.

18:09.961 --> 18:12.696
I have to go home now.

18:12.764 --> 18:14.265
If I wander off,
the caretaker will come for me.

18:14.332 --> 18:16.667
I don't think you need to
worry about the Terminator, pal.

18:16.735 --> 18:17.769
- Eh--
- Another movie thing.

18:17.836 --> 18:19.604
Put it in your queue.

18:19.671 --> 18:21.172
They can break my bones,

18:21.240 --> 18:22.307
but I will always mend!

18:26.846 --> 18:29.215
What are you--

18:29.282 --> 18:33.786
he can recover from
a broken neck?

18:33.854 --> 18:36.622
I'm your caretaker now.

18:36.690 --> 18:39.091
And I will always keep you safe,
no matter what.

18:43.794 --> 18:47.330
So do you think Parish is the
one who's lactose intolerant?

18:47.398 --> 18:48.932
Well, every Alpha has
a downside.

18:48.933 --> 18:51.334
Maybe we finally found his.

18:51.402 --> 18:53.470
Look at you
making jokes.

18:53.938 --> 18:56.172
Maybe memory is his downside.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.640
I mean, think about it.
Why else would he keep

18:57.708 --> 19:00.910
an Alpha journal around unless
his memory was slipping?

19:00.978 --> 19:03.079
Right before
my grandpa kicked it,

19:03.146 --> 19:05.247
he used to call
me by the cat's name.

19:05.315 --> 19:07.283
He was 70.

19:07.350 --> 19:10.352
Parish is over 200 years old.

19:10.420 --> 19:11.620
Have you guys seen my keys?

19:11.688 --> 19:13.722
I-I can't find my keys.

19:13.790 --> 19:16.826
Yeah, grandpa
used to say that too.

19:16.893 --> 19:18.260
Look at you, smiling.

19:18.328 --> 19:20.963
Don't hurt yourself.

19:21.031 --> 19:23.699
I'm sorry.

19:23.767 --> 19:26.268
Jeez, I suck at this.

19:26.336 --> 19:27.603
Hey, look.

19:27.671 --> 19:29.337
Thinking about Dani is--
it's messing you up.

19:29.405 --> 19:32.274
So maybe, you know,
you should just stop.

19:32.341 --> 19:33.909
Or
 just stop.

19:33.976 --> 19:36.745
Yeah.
You--you'll feel much better,

19:36.812 --> 19:39.715
if you just
stop thinking about her.

19:39.783 --> 19:42.384
Man, you really
don't get it, do you?

19:42.452 --> 19:44.352
And for you,
all you do is forget.

19:44.420 --> 19:45.887
So, tell you what.
Come on, teach me.

19:45.955 --> 19:49.423
I wish I could.

19:51.593 --> 19:53.727
Um...

19:53.795 --> 19:56.796
I can help you.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.099
I can put you inside

19:59.166 --> 20:00.833
your memories of Dani.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.539
Shut the hell up, Mitchell.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.544
Hey! Hey, come on.
Here's the town.

20:12.612 --> 20:16.081
At least I don't suck
at directions.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.882
Okay, so...

20:17.950 --> 20:19.785
You remember, obviously,

20:19.853 --> 20:22.320
by rewiring here and here,
Skylar increased the power.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.356
Yeah, and made the effect
of this device instantaneous,

20:24.424 --> 20:26.258
as you know.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.827
Well, yeah,
how could I forget?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.695
Okay, so take a look.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.163
If you combine
all the components

20:32.231 --> 20:35.067
of that factory shipment
together, you could end up

20:35.134 --> 20:37.536
with a device that could
replicate Skylar's power boost.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.572
And conceivably increase the
ability of hundreds of Alphas,

20:40.640 --> 20:44.108
all of whom believe
in Parish's cause.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.510
I got this.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.378
So, I'll hotwire a car.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.182
We'll be back in Manhattan
in time for <i>Jeopardy!</i>

20:50.249 --> 20:52.017
Yeah, we could drive
a stolen car back to the city.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.186
Or I could just head over there
and rent one.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.054
Ah! That's why
I keep you around.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.690
Always thinking.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.126
Just keep him out of sight,
all right?

21:15.275 --> 21:19.579
Okay, come on.
Let's go.

21:19.647 --> 21:22.149
Get down.

21:22.216 --> 21:23.884
When am I going home?

21:23.952 --> 21:28.121
Um, you're gonna get
a new home, I assume.

21:28.189 --> 21:29.356
Can't give you
all the details,

21:29.424 --> 21:30.657
'cause it's above
my pay grade,

21:30.725 --> 21:32.759
but I'm sure it's gonna be...
Awesome.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.911
Who is she?

21:52.979 --> 21:54.846
Why can't I remember?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.648
I can help you, too.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.618
With a memory.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.320
If you want.

22:02.388 --> 22:06.857
Um, no, thanks.

22:06.925 --> 22:11.295
I'm kind of a hard nut
to crack in that department.

22:13.966 --> 22:17.802
Are you sure?

22:23.742 --> 22:26.478
There was a woman
in a blue dress.

22:29.448 --> 22:33.685
I think she might be my mom.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.226
Well, if she's in there,

22:41.294 --> 22:42.293
I can help you find her.

22:57.909 --> 23:02.473
Clorera has never let me down.

23:02.541 --> 23:04.339
Clorera has the strength
to clean up life's messes.

23:05.575 --> 23:07.408
Big and small.

23:07.476 --> 23:09.744
What the hell was that?

23:09.812 --> 23:13.581
Where's the rest of it?

23:13.649 --> 23:15.617
I'm sorry,
that's all there is.

23:15.684 --> 23:17.952
No.

23:18.019 --> 23:20.420
No, that can't be it.
That can't be all I have.

23:20.488 --> 23:22.556
I'm sorry.

23:22.623 --> 23:25.225
I really am.

23:25.293 --> 23:27.394
I don't have anything.

23:27.462 --> 23:31.165
I can't even remember which
are my memories anymore.

23:33.935 --> 23:37.872
Ms. Theroux.
I'd like to talk.

23:37.939 --> 23:40.808
I'm sorry, I'm--
I'm just going home.

23:40.876 --> 23:45.880
I spoke to Agent Cley
about you.

23:45.948 --> 23:48.950
He said that you can put
thoughts in people's minds.

23:49.018 --> 23:52.087
Make them do things.

23:52.155 --> 23:53.288
I'm not feeling very well.

23:53.356 --> 23:54.556
I need to go.

23:54.624 --> 23:58.761
Do they remember what you did?

23:58.829 --> 23:59.896
Why do you ask, senator?

23:59.964 --> 24:01.698
Because I've been pushed.

24:01.766 --> 24:05.836
At first I thought
I was losing my mind.

24:05.904 --> 24:09.239
But when Parish's attack
came to light,

24:09.307 --> 24:12.442
I thought an Alpha could
be responsible for my...

24:12.510 --> 24:14.378
experience.

24:14.445 --> 24:16.847
An Alpha like you.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.448
I joined the task force

24:18.516 --> 24:19.883
because I need answers.

24:19.951 --> 24:22.486
I need to know if I was pushed

24:22.554 --> 24:28.425
by one of Parish's people.

24:28.493 --> 24:31.327
- By one of Parish's--
- I'm questioning everything.

24:31.395 --> 24:33.563
Is what I'm doing my decision,

24:33.630 --> 24:35.298
or someone else's?

24:35.365 --> 24:37.033
I just want
to trust myself again.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.536
You can.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.104
The person
who did this to you

24:42.172 --> 24:44.273
isn't in control
of you anymore.

24:48.713 --> 24:51.047
Your mind is yours.

24:51.115 --> 24:56.853
How can you be sure?

24:56.921 --> 24:58.522
I really need to go home.

24:58.589 --> 25:01.124
Charlotte...

25:01.192 --> 25:05.462
Go home.

25:05.530 --> 25:06.897
You.

25:09.205 --> 25:13.208
God, I hate the smell
of the docks.

25:13.276 --> 25:15.077
Must be worse for you, huh?

25:15.145 --> 25:17.279
Actually,
it's not bothering me.

25:17.347 --> 25:20.149
I think I've come to
a Zen place with my senses.

25:20.217 --> 25:22.351
It's like I've finally found
a balance between everything--

25:22.419 --> 25:24.587
Between what?
Sex and what?

25:24.654 --> 25:25.888
I know you're having sex.

25:25.956 --> 25:28.357
- That is none of your business.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

25:28.425 --> 25:29.992
The manifest
says industrial electronics.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.461
It hasn't been inspected yet.

25:31.528 --> 25:32.762
It hasn't been touched since
it arrived yesterday.

25:32.830 --> 25:34.297
Still sealed.

25:34.364 --> 25:36.432
Maritime's gone for the day.
There's nobody here

25:36.500 --> 25:38.367
to open this can for you.

25:38.435 --> 25:41.837
We could try a chop--

25:44.842 --> 25:48.211
We got this.
Thanks.

25:57.922 --> 26:00.224
There are patterns
in the dust.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.794
The boxes were here.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.796
Thousands of them.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.264
He has them.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.300
Parish already has them.

26:10.336 --> 26:13.739
Now, where did he take them?

26:28.088 --> 26:29.121
Okay, I'll do it.

26:29.189 --> 26:32.825
Do what, sweetheart?

26:32.893 --> 26:36.496
I'll come home,
and look after you.

26:36.563 --> 26:38.297
But I have a new schedule now.

26:38.365 --> 26:39.933
And I have--
I have pudding every day.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.735
We have to go and buy
a load of pudding.

26:41.803 --> 26:44.771
'Cause I have--
I have it every afternoon.

26:44.839 --> 26:46.072
I should be having
some right now,

26:46.140 --> 26:47.507
but I'm here
looking after you.

26:47.575 --> 26:50.410
We'll make it work.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.446
I'm--I'm glad you're here.

26:52.513 --> 26:55.115
Oh, yeah, you're welcome.

26:55.182 --> 26:57.684
Is it?

26:57.751 --> 26:59.519
Hey. Hey, look.

26:59.586 --> 27:02.054
Oh, wait.
You're attached.

27:02.122 --> 27:05.191
There's a thing.

27:05.259 --> 27:08.261
- That's a step, right there.
- Whoa! The--oh.

27:08.328 --> 27:10.730
Yeah.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.632
It--
It's banana.

27:12.699 --> 27:13.733
No banana?

27:13.800 --> 27:15.201
I like blueberry.

27:15.269 --> 27:17.537
Well, I'm...

27:17.604 --> 27:19.205
I'm sure if we ask the nurse,
we can--

27:19.273 --> 27:21.274
soo--szzah--
No, I-I don't--

27:22.376 --> 27:24.877
Szzsahzz--

27:24.945 --> 27:27.146
Oh. Oh, Mom?

27:27.214 --> 27:29.916
Mom?
Hey, Doctor.

27:29.983 --> 27:31.184
Mrs. Bell.

27:31.251 --> 27:34.020
- Is she okay?
- Mrs. Bell, can you hear me?

27:34.088 --> 27:35.622
She was just--
she was awake.

27:35.690 --> 27:36.790
Talking to me.
Can you hear me, Mrs.-

27:36.857 --> 27:37.891
Mrs. Bell, you're
in the hospital.

27:37.958 --> 27:39.025
Can you say that for me?

27:39.093 --> 27:41.294
Probably a C.V.A.

27:41.362 --> 27:43.396
Okay, get her on 94% O2,
all right?

27:43.464 --> 27:45.265
Page I.R. and tell them
to prepare for angio and T.P.A.

27:45.333 --> 27:46.666
What is all that stuff?

27:46.734 --> 27:48.168
And get him
out of here, please?

27:48.235 --> 27:49.636
- I'm sorry, you have to go.
- Excuse me--what--no, no.

27:49.704 --> 27:53.140
Oh--what are those things?

27:53.208 --> 27:54.541
Is she okay, though?
She was just--

27:54.609 --> 27:57.144
she was just awake.
- Just hang in there.

27:57.211 --> 27:59.279
Hang tough
a little longer now.

27:59.347 --> 28:02.149
Stay with me.

28:02.217 --> 28:03.884
I know you don't approve.

28:03.951 --> 28:07.287
But she was living in fear
because of what we did to her.

28:07.355 --> 28:09.456
I couldn't
leave her like that.

28:09.523 --> 28:11.391
It's better that she's scared
of me than scared of herself.

28:11.459 --> 28:13.327
Better?

28:13.394 --> 28:15.696
Nina, you of all people know
that fear can make people

28:15.763 --> 28:17.864
do all sorts
of unpredictable things.

28:17.932 --> 28:22.502
Letting her know was
the right thing to do.

28:22.570 --> 28:25.139
All right, I'll--I'll reach
out to her and see what I can do

28:25.206 --> 28:28.175
to smooth things over.

28:28.243 --> 28:29.443
This is the person
you wanted me to be.

28:35.484 --> 28:37.151
Dr. Rosen, Agent Cley
needs you to take a--

28:37.219 --> 28:40.254
Not now.

28:44.093 --> 28:45.226
Excuse us.

28:45.294 --> 28:48.463
I need to speak with Dr. Rosen.

28:59.475 --> 29:02.177
I just finished combing
through a raft of documents

29:02.244 --> 29:06.014
regarding the unconstitutional
actions of your team.

29:06.082 --> 29:11.486
I believe the Attorney General
will be extremely interested.

29:11.553 --> 29:14.422
Yes, I can imagine
he would be.

29:14.490 --> 29:17.392
Your team is more dangerous
than the Alphas they go after.

29:17.459 --> 29:21.462
And you?
You are the worst.

29:21.530 --> 29:24.632
You use them
to assault innocents

29:24.700 --> 29:27.868
under a pretense of justice.
Senator Burton,

29:27.936 --> 29:30.371
I apologize for pushing you.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.006
I can assure you,
we don't do that

29:32.074 --> 29:33.874
without a lot
of consideration.

29:33.942 --> 29:37.644
But the other option was
to blackmail you,

29:37.712 --> 29:39.646
with the illegal contribution
to your first campaign,

29:39.714 --> 29:43.584
or that you had been compromised
by Parish's organization

29:43.651 --> 29:44.952
in regards to August Medical.

29:45.019 --> 29:47.087
So I decided
to have Nina push you,

29:47.155 --> 29:49.990
because I thought that was
the gentler of the options.

29:50.058 --> 29:53.160
And I'd like to think that
I won't regret that choice.

29:57.098 --> 29:59.733
And, uh, yes, Senator,
you are right.

29:59.801 --> 30:02.135
My team is dangerous.

30:02.203 --> 30:05.038
And so am I.

30:09.559 --> 30:11.493
Hey, Kat, I got the car,
so, uh...

30:11.561 --> 30:16.998
Look, just meet me where
I left you off, all right?

30:28.843 --> 30:30.644
Aah!

30:30.712 --> 30:32.412
Where is he?

30:42.891 --> 30:45.292
Hicks, you ready?

30:45.360 --> 30:46.560
Let's trade.

30:46.628 --> 30:48.896
Oh, crap.
Uh, look...

30:48.964 --> 30:52.266
Mr. Caretaker, I'm not really
authorized to make deals.

30:52.334 --> 30:55.369
Well you've got five minutes
to figure it out.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.637
I need to call you back.

30:56.705 --> 30:57.939
Shoot.

30:58.006 --> 31:01.642
Okay, Mitchell,
I need you to focus.

31:01.710 --> 31:05.513
You're the caretaker.
How do you do your thing?

31:05.581 --> 31:06.881
- I'm your caretaker now.
- Mm-hmm.

31:06.948 --> 31:07.915
And I will always keep
you safe.

31:07.982 --> 31:09.283
Yeah, got that.

31:09.350 --> 31:10.551
I need the other side
of the coin.

31:10.618 --> 31:13.621
The downside.

31:13.688 --> 31:15.656
How many times have I told you
not to drink my milk, Mitchell?

31:15.723 --> 31:18.692
Your system can't handle it.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.828
Milk cartons.

31:21.896 --> 31:25.465
Okay, he needs a ton
of calcium to help him heal.

31:25.533 --> 31:28.401
Which means his osteoblasts

31:28.469 --> 31:32.472
would increase his bone
density like crazy.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.975
Hey, Caretaker?

31:35.043 --> 31:37.178
Did you break a bathroom scale

31:37.245 --> 31:38.879
while you were healing?
Do you get, like, super heavy?

31:38.947 --> 31:40.982
Have I ever told you about
the time I met McEnroe?

31:42.117 --> 31:43.450
In Malibu.
Super nice guy.

31:43.518 --> 31:45.386
- Yeah, you did.
- Where are my keys?

31:45.454 --> 31:46.821
Okay, let's swap.

31:46.888 --> 31:48.322
I'll text you
a longitude and latitude.

31:48.390 --> 31:51.125
- Oh, so now you're in charge?
- Yeah, I pick the location,

31:51.193 --> 31:52.860
'cause I have the leverage.
How do you figure?

31:52.928 --> 31:53.894
Well, if I lose Hicks,
I get yelled at.

31:53.962 --> 31:55.129
If you lose Mitchell,

31:55.196 --> 31:56.497
I'm guessing you get
a painful death.

32:04.105 --> 32:07.108
I really hope I know how
to drive one of those things.

32:16.051 --> 32:17.552
How's your mom?

32:17.619 --> 32:21.322
She had another stroke.

32:21.390 --> 32:22.624
She had a little stroke,

32:22.691 --> 32:25.260
and that's why
she crashed the car.

32:25.327 --> 32:27.128
Because normally
she's a good driver.

32:27.196 --> 32:29.731
And then--but now she had
the bigger stroke.

32:29.799 --> 32:31.366
And she's unconscious,

32:31.433 --> 32:34.436
and the doctor doesn't know when
she's gonna wake up again.

32:38.575 --> 32:39.742
Are you okay?

32:39.809 --> 32:41.310
Yeah, of course
I'm okay, Bill.

32:41.378 --> 32:43.246
I didn't have a stroke.

33:05.638 --> 33:08.407
Hey, Mitchell!

33:08.474 --> 33:13.312
Hey, Mitchell!

33:13.379 --> 33:14.413
Mitchell.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.515
Where you been, man?

33:16.582 --> 33:18.917
I-I don't know if I ever
told you this, but, uh...

33:18.985 --> 33:20.586
I actually used to
run a fishing boat

33:20.654 --> 33:23.722
out of these very waters.

33:23.790 --> 33:25.858
Mitchell, where's
the girl you were with?

33:25.926 --> 33:27.293
Concentrate on the present.
The girl you were just with.

33:27.361 --> 33:28.427
Where is she?

33:28.495 --> 33:29.728
She drove off.

33:29.796 --> 33:31.296
She told me to walk.
You know,

33:31.364 --> 33:33.265
these waters are pretty deep,

33:33.333 --> 33:35.835
and I used to high dive

33:35.902 --> 33:38.337
in water that was--
that was shallower than this.

33:38.405 --> 33:40.072
Mitchell,
don't go near the water!

34:33.158 --> 34:37.194
Hicks?

34:37.262 --> 34:41.065
Hicks!

34:43.635 --> 34:46.203
Oh, crap.

34:46.271 --> 34:47.605
He's in the trunk, isn't he?

34:51.743 --> 34:57.581
Hand me that rock.

35:03.488 --> 35:05.857
Don't go near
the water, Mitchell.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.201
Quit flailing.

35:40.708 --> 35:42.275
You seriously don't know
how to swim?

35:42.343 --> 35:43.777
I'm sorry.

35:43.844 --> 35:46.946
I was too busy learning how
to pick locks under water.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.649
How'd you know
the caretaker would sink?

35:49.717 --> 35:52.118
He's too heavy.

35:52.186 --> 35:53.786
His--when he's healing,

35:53.854 --> 35:57.057
his bone density weighs
him down.

35:57.124 --> 35:58.959
Remember the milk
and the broken scale?

35:59.026 --> 36:00.927
- Yeah.
- It's a science thing.

36:00.995 --> 36:03.163
Come on.

36:03.231 --> 36:05.032
Hello, Mitchell.

36:05.099 --> 36:07.801
I'm Dr. Lee Rosen.

36:07.869 --> 36:09.536
I'm very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

36:09.604 --> 36:11.605
Dr. Rosen.

36:11.672 --> 36:15.643
He's an arrogant bastard,
but I like him.

36:15.710 --> 36:19.480
Those are Stanton Parish's
words, aren't they?

36:19.548 --> 36:23.550
Can you show me, um, uh...

36:23.618 --> 36:25.219
the last time
you spoke with Mr. Parish?

36:32.460 --> 36:37.631
I must never forget what
I'm feeling right now.

36:37.699 --> 36:42.669
I've lost another someone
who was very dear to me.

36:42.737 --> 36:44.071
Dani is dead.

36:44.138 --> 36:47.207
I'm responsible for her death.
I killed her.

36:47.275 --> 36:49.376
I sacrificed her.

36:52.714 --> 36:56.617
Well, I'm sure it was
for a good reason.

36:56.685 --> 36:58.852
You always make
the right decision.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.287
That's what you told me.

37:00.355 --> 37:01.755
Did I?
Did I say that?

37:01.823 --> 37:05.092
Yeah.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.728
Yes.

37:07.795 --> 37:10.164
Well, I wish it were true.

37:16.505 --> 37:19.339
I don't think I did.

37:21.976 --> 37:23.978
No, not this time.

37:27.282 --> 37:29.683
If I could have
that moment back.

37:34.322 --> 37:37.657
I can't let her death
be for nothing, can I?

37:37.725 --> 37:39.426
I refuse to fail.

37:39.493 --> 37:44.197
Fail?

37:48.703 --> 37:51.973
You're all
I have left now, Mitchell.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.841
I promise you,

37:53.909 --> 37:59.482
you will grow old in
a better world than I have.

37:59.549 --> 38:01.683
This farmhouse is my home.

38:01.751 --> 38:04.887
I built it with my father.

38:04.954 --> 38:09.825
It's where I raised
my first family in.

38:09.893 --> 38:13.296
Really, it's still the only
place I feel at home.

38:18.068 --> 38:20.136
Those are my memories,
Mitchell.

38:31.482 --> 38:34.217
♪ ♪

38:34.285 --> 38:36.753
Clorera has the strength
to clean up life's messes.

38:36.821 --> 38:38.288
May I?

38:42.493 --> 38:45.562
Hey, Kat, it's your old buddy,
Cam Hicks.

38:45.630 --> 38:47.130
And I just wanted to say,
for the record,

38:47.197 --> 38:49.132
thanks for saving my life today,

38:49.200 --> 38:52.635
but you are the most annoying
person in the world

38:52.703 --> 38:57.174
to take a road trip with.

38:57.241 --> 39:00.577
Hey.

39:00.645 --> 39:02.913
What I said before,

39:02.981 --> 39:07.652
about if I could help
you forget, I would?

39:07.720 --> 39:10.922
I wouldn't.

39:10.990 --> 39:12.223
You okay?

39:12.291 --> 39:16.495
Yeah, I'm great.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.297
Turns out the only memory
I have of my life

39:18.364 --> 39:22.935
is some stupid commercial
with this stupid actress.

39:23.002 --> 39:26.304
Look, you're lucky
to have your memories.

39:26.372 --> 39:28.974
Even the ones that hurt.

39:29.042 --> 39:32.477
They let you know
who you are.

39:32.545 --> 39:34.546
Well...

39:34.614 --> 39:37.882
I know who you are.

39:37.950 --> 39:39.851
You are the girl
who can drive a rig,

39:39.918 --> 39:43.579
and can pick a lock
underwater.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.514
I don't know if
I have the stomach for this.

39:45.582 --> 39:47.550
Come on, you're an ace.

39:47.617 --> 39:50.286
That guy.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.755
I killed him,
and I don't like how it feels.

39:52.822 --> 39:54.757
- That was justified.
- Yeah, was it?

39:54.824 --> 39:57.892
I mean,
he was just doing his job.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.427
Just trying
to protect Mitchell.

40:06.568 --> 40:09.370
I killed a man today,

40:09.437 --> 40:14.607
and I don't ever want
to forget how that feels.

40:35.263 --> 40:36.998
So?

40:37.065 --> 40:38.532
You get Parish's plans?

40:38.600 --> 40:40.067
No, Cameron, I didn't.

40:40.135 --> 40:43.571
It seems that Parish doesn't
use him in that way.

40:43.639 --> 40:47.841
He talks to Mitchell
about his feelings.

40:47.909 --> 40:49.176
Entire operation's a bust.

40:49.244 --> 40:50.511
No. No, it's not.

40:50.579 --> 40:52.046
Quite the contrary.

40:52.113 --> 40:54.549
I learned
quite a bit in there.

40:54.617 --> 40:58.553
I learned that, uh,
I have misjudged Mr. Parish.

40:58.620 --> 41:01.723
He is not a sociopath.

41:01.790 --> 41:05.659
He cares quite deeply
about this young man,

41:05.727 --> 41:09.196
and he cares quite deeply
about Dani.

41:09.264 --> 41:12.933
And this humanity
of his makes him vulnerable.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.901
That's his weakness.

41:14.969 --> 41:18.405
And we are going
to use it against him.

41:26.748 --> 41:31.119
I don't have my keys.

41:32.654 --> 41:36.058
Here.
I was holding 'em for you.

42:00.516 --> 42:02.251
Mitchell didn't
do anything wrong.

42:02.318 --> 42:03.719
He doesn't deserve to be there.

42:03.787 --> 42:06.188
I know.
But Building Seven might

42:06.256 --> 42:07.623
very well be
the best thing for him.

42:07.690 --> 42:09.925
At least his mind will
be at peace there.

42:09.992 --> 42:11.693
Either way, you're not gonna
lose any sleep over it, are you?

42:11.761 --> 42:15.131
Sleep? What's that?

42:15.198 --> 42:19.068
Cameron, Mitchell is nothing
more than a thread to be pulled,

42:19.135 --> 42:21.070
and Parish will unravel.

42:21.137 --> 42:22.805
Parish won't let
you keep Mitchell chipped.

42:22.872 --> 42:24.473
He'll come for him.

42:27.410 --> 42:29.278
Let him come.
