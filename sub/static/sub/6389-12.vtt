<i>Previously on Californication...</i>

00:09.638 --> 00:10.804
God, you're Becca!

00:10.815 --> 00:12.519
I... have some news.

00:12.541 --> 00:13.993
Yeah, me too. That's why I'm here.

00:14.005 --> 00:15.983
Are you excited to meet your brother?

00:15.995 --> 00:18.510
- My brother?
- Hey, everyone.

00:18.533 --> 00:20.923
Look, I don't want to limit
your sexual exploration,

00:20.933 --> 00:23.654
but you gotta lay off the
hookers, because it's illegal!

00:23.677 --> 00:27.873
You need to start dealing with
some real live women, one-on-one.

00:28.983 --> 00:30.046
Hi.

00:30.070 --> 00:31.762
Uh, hi, pretty lady.

00:31.773 --> 00:34.596
I assume that the offer still stands?

00:34.597 --> 00:35.980
Are you in?

00:36.100 --> 00:37.867
Yes, I'm in.

00:38.164 --> 00:40.062
- I have an idea.
- You're not gonna do it?

00:40.073 --> 00:42.439
No, I'm gonna do it.
Maybe you should do it too.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.028
- I'm getting married.
- No, you're not!

00:45.030 --> 00:46.967
Well, there's not a lot you
can do about it, is there?

00:46.990 --> 00:49.321
- This is ridiculous.
- Any more than this?

00:49.322 --> 00:52.169
I cannot in good conscience
endorse this shit, Becca.

00:52.187 --> 00:53.525
We're doing it in New York.

00:53.566 --> 00:56.461
You can be a part of it or
not... totally up to you.

00:56.502 --> 00:59.133
And I'm not gonna let you make
me fucking miserable about it.

01:08.505 --> 01:10.640
I can pay you. What if I pay you?

01:10.681 --> 01:11.864
You're an asshole.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.079
Yes, but I'm an asshole who loves you

01:14.112 --> 01:15.932
- something fierce, baby.
- I know.

01:15.965 --> 01:17.464
I just want what's best for you.

01:17.497 --> 01:18.716
I know that too.

01:18.772 --> 01:20.375
Which is why it's hard
for me to get excited

01:20.399 --> 01:22.882
when you're g... getting... [Gags]

01:22.915 --> 01:25.463
[Chokes]

01:25.583 --> 01:26.886
Married.

01:27.413 --> 01:29.162
I'm not getting married.

01:29.195 --> 01:31.639
- You're not?
- No, it's not a good idea.

01:31.681 --> 01:32.900
It's not? It's not!

01:33.020 --> 01:36.143
Oh, I'm so happy you're
on the same page with me.

01:36.176 --> 01:39.254
Between your mother and you,
that almost never happens.

01:39.287 --> 01:42.245
There's no point in me
getting married, ever.

01:42.365 --> 01:46.101
Well, now... now, that's a wee bit extreme.

01:46.134 --> 01:49.374
You could wait till, like, 30 or 35.

01:49.415 --> 01:51.277
You know, your 20s and early 30s

01:51.310 --> 01:53.602
are gonna be an endless
procession of douche bags...

01:53.613 --> 01:55.598
trust me, but just hang tight.

01:56.128 --> 01:57.694
There's no way I'll ever be able

01:57.727 --> 01:59.268
to have a successful relationship.

01:59.388 --> 02:01.775
- Why do you say that?
- Because of you.

02:02.225 --> 02:05.176
Have you ever been able
to sustain a relationship?

02:06.014 --> 02:08.697
You say you love me, you say you love mom,

02:08.740 --> 02:11.589
but what does that mean when
you only ever let us down?

02:12.113 --> 02:14.535
I'm my father's daughter.

02:15.479 --> 02:16.965
Becca!

02:17.613 --> 02:19.740
[Gasps]

02:21.520 --> 02:23.123
You all right, buddy?

02:23.156 --> 02:25.328
I'm fine. What the fuck are you doing here?

02:25.361 --> 02:27.263
Marcy and I had a fight.

02:27.296 --> 02:29.434
She's gonna sleep with Stu tomorrow.

02:29.475 --> 02:32.015
Can I sleep here with you tonight?

02:47.775 --> 02:49.851
Shh.

02:52.455 --> 02:55.421
[Upbeat music]

02:55.454 --> 03:03.435
â™ª

03:42.086 --> 03:43.814
Hey. Where is she?

03:43.847 --> 03:45.119
Gone.

03:45.152 --> 03:45.973
Gone? What do you mean gone?

03:45.973 --> 03:47.756
Well, she left for New York this morning.

03:47.777 --> 03:48.693
She's gone to meet his parents.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.009
- Meet his parents?
- Yeah.

03:50.052 --> 03:51.214
Jesus Christ, Karen.

03:51.235 --> 03:52.784
This is more serious than I thought.

03:52.904 --> 03:54.806
Well, what part of "dad,
I'm getting married"

03:54.813 --> 03:57.024
- did you not think was serious?
- The whole fucking thing.

03:57.066 --> 04:00.087
It's like the setup to some
horrible practical joke.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.157
You know, I... I keep on
expecting Ashton Kutcher

04:03.171 --> 04:05.072
to make an appearance... he's
not in your bathroom, is he?

04:05.101 --> 04:06.960
Are you fucking Ashton Kutcher, Karen?

04:06.981 --> 04:08.269
You might need these.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.262
They're having the ceremony at
his parents' house this weekend.

04:12.290 --> 04:13.762
Oh, no, that is... that is crazy.

04:13.882 --> 04:15.642
Mm-hmm. Maybe, maybe not.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.593
No, that's not normal.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.075
That's not the way it's supposed to happen.

04:18.108 --> 04:19.476
Okay, so what do you want to do...

04:19.509 --> 04:20.558
like, pretend it's not happening?

04:20.579 --> 04:22.315
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

04:22.762 --> 04:24.262
Well, look at the choices we made.

04:24.325 --> 04:26.147
- Mm-hmm.
- We decided not to get married.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.769
We were too cool and, you know,
too bohemian for that shit.

04:28.889 --> 04:30.290
And look where that got us.

04:30.410 --> 04:31.941
How cool are we right now?

04:31.974 --> 04:33.404
Is that what you want for her...

04:33.437 --> 04:36.354
our life, our ridiculous fucking story?

04:36.413 --> 04:40.117
No, Karen, I see no reason to
denigrate our beautiful story.

04:40.237 --> 04:42.043
And I have every reason in the world

04:42.079 --> 04:44.221
to be mad about the most
recent turn of events here.

04:44.254 --> 04:45.889
- Where is that gonna get you?
- I don't know!

04:45.889 --> 04:48.185
It just feels pretty fucking
good right now... that's all.

04:48.206 --> 04:49.657
Okay, well, stay angry,
then, because you know what?

04:49.685 --> 04:52.579
You're way too fucking old to
be dragged kicking and screaming

04:52.593 --> 04:53.988
into doing the right thing.

04:54.004 --> 04:54.952
How do you know it's the right thing?

04:54.959 --> 04:55.924
Because she's our kid,

04:55.945 --> 04:57.346
- and she fucking needs us...
- Yes, yes,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.135
- and that's all I need to know.-
- that's right. That's the point...

04:59.156 --> 05:01.409
She's a kid and she's
behaving like a fucking kid.

05:03.543 --> 05:05.297
- [Cell phone rings]
- What?

05:05.417 --> 05:07.121
You just gonna let it ring?

05:08.508 --> 05:10.367
Who is it... Julia?

05:10.374 --> 05:11.946
- Ashton.
- Julia?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.022
- Kutcher.
- Great. Okay.

05:13.043 --> 05:15.400
- It's Anton Kirchner.
- Deal with it. Deal with it, Hank.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.222
Just fucking deal with
something in your life.

05:17.255 --> 05:19.170
I'm leaving tonight,
and I'll keep you posted.

05:19.177 --> 05:20.620
Shouldn't we talk about this some more?

05:20.653 --> 05:23.473
We're done talking. I'm
all about the doing, okay?

05:23.593 --> 05:24.989
Hello?

05:25.109 --> 05:26.579
Julia, just slow down.

05:26.621 --> 05:28.164
- Jesus Christ.
- I don't want to know.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.632
Oh, fuck. What, are you kidding me? Again?

05:38.417 --> 05:40.563
Looking hot, Marcy. Hot.

05:41.335 --> 05:43.321
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

05:43.441 --> 05:45.174
I guess you want to look your
best when somebody's paying

05:45.191 --> 05:46.843
a million bucks to fuck you, right?

05:46.963 --> 05:49.033
Makes sense. Way to go!

05:49.153 --> 05:51.385
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

05:51.505 --> 05:53.315
Get it fucking done!

05:53.667 --> 05:55.207
Whoo-hoo!

05:55.209 --> 05:56.272
This is exactly why

05:56.301 --> 05:57.912
I didn't want you in the house today.

05:58.230 --> 05:59.744
Oh, oh, right.

05:59.779 --> 06:01.364
So I wouldn't see you, right?

06:01.413 --> 06:02.716
That's sweet...

06:02.836 --> 06:05.149
like a bride on her wedding day, huh?

06:05.152 --> 06:07.182
- Like that? Is that what you mean?
- Charlie.

06:07.218 --> 06:09.112
Maybe I got something going on today too.

06:09.147 --> 06:11.541
Yeah, maybe I'm gonna get fucked today.

06:11.661 --> 06:14.866
- Whoo-hoo!
- Will you stop whoo-hooing?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.246
And I told you, I don't
want to know about it.

06:17.281 --> 06:19.901
And you better not fuck anyone in my house.

06:19.943 --> 06:21.605
It was my house first, you know.

06:21.662 --> 06:23.169
And I fucked a lot of ladies here.

06:23.176 --> 06:25.444
A lot... 102, in fact, to be precise.

06:25.493 --> 06:27.950
Yep, I fucked 'em here,
right on this chair.

06:27.992 --> 06:30.077
I fucked 'em there. I fucked 'em there.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.274
I fucked 'em on the counter.

06:31.316 --> 06:33.605
I even fucked 'em bent over
this chair right here...

06:33.641 --> 06:34.669
your favorite spot.

06:34.789 --> 06:36.260
Bloop... I slipped right in.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.704
It was no problem at all.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.211
Good for you, baby. Mm.

06:40.331 --> 06:42.048
Good for you.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.324
We're gonna laugh about
this one day, you know?

06:44.352 --> 06:45.894
Oh, you sure about that?

06:46.091 --> 06:47.542
I love you.

06:47.662 --> 06:49.451
I'm sure about that.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.499
You better fucking say it back.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.830
[Mumbling] I love you too.

07:00.232 --> 07:02.344
You better not have a fucking orgasm.

07:03.281 --> 07:04.826
I'll do my best.

07:13.263 --> 07:15.404
I'm so fucking disappointed in you, Levon.

07:15.411 --> 07:17.122
That hurts my fucking feelings, mom.

07:17.157 --> 07:19.347
You damage my self-esteem
when you say shit like that.

07:19.396 --> 07:21.072
You think it's okay if I slap him silly?

07:21.093 --> 07:22.431
We don't hit in this family, Hank.

07:22.452 --> 07:24.248
- Yeah, maybe we should.
- Try it.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.988
I'll see you in court, motherfucker!

07:26.016 --> 07:28.671
Think I'll see you in
court first, motherfucker.

07:28.671 --> 07:29.981
Now you have a criminal record.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.664
And you owe me a shit ton of money.

07:31.678 --> 07:33.326
- I'm good for it.
- No, you're not.

07:33.347 --> 07:34.692
- You're unemployed.
- Which is why I was

07:34.714 --> 07:36.791
seeking comfort in the arms
of a streetwalker, okay?

07:36.826 --> 07:38.652
I didn't know that shit was illegal.

07:38.685 --> 07:40.855
- Really?
- I mean, I guess I knew,

07:40.887 --> 07:42.793
but I thought cops always
looked the other way.

07:42.826 --> 07:44.869
- Lesson learned.
- This is seriously unhealthy.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.721
I'm gonna have to send
you back to Dr. Lawson.

07:46.904 --> 07:48.925
- Who's Dr. Lawson?
- His therapist.

07:49.045 --> 07:50.052
Why'd he stop?

07:50.108 --> 07:51.665
'Cause I fucking healed myself.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.066
- Oh, you did? Good job.
- Yeah.

07:53.094 --> 07:54.559
- I can't talk to you right now!
- Nice job.

07:54.601 --> 07:56.918
So why don't you just go home,
and I'll take care of this.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.622
You're the one who started
this in the first place.

07:58.643 --> 08:01.073
I know. Just let me see
if I can end it, all right?

08:01.834 --> 08:02.799
Bye, mom.

08:03.461 --> 08:05.256
- Come here.
- Ah!

08:06.109 --> 08:09.447
- Hello?
- Oh, hello, hello, hello.

08:09.932 --> 08:13.130
Winston, allow me to
introduce you to Hope and Love.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.939
Hope and Love. Oh.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.376
Please, come in, come in, come in.

08:16.404 --> 08:17.664
Yes, enjoy.

08:17.689 --> 08:19.362
Make yourselves at home. There's shrimp...

08:19.482 --> 08:21.390
crustaceans to enjoy on the table.

08:21.447 --> 08:22.467
You have a lovely home.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.763
Oh, well, thank you. That's
a very nice thing to say.

08:25.059 --> 08:26.080
Hope's all yours.

08:26.101 --> 08:27.362
- I want Love.
- Okay.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.735
It's easy for me to remember that way...

08:29.855 --> 08:32.890
like, "bend over, Love.
Don't orphan me balls, Love."

08:32.940 --> 08:34.707
It rolls of the tongue,
you know what I mean?

08:35.024 --> 08:36.967
Whatever you say, Krull, whatever you say.

08:37.001 --> 08:38.876
You feeling okay about this?

08:38.909 --> 08:39.876
[Exhales deeply] Hmm?

08:39.909 --> 08:41.905
Oh, yeah, just... j...

08:42.025 --> 08:43.610
I think it's just what the doctor ordered.

08:43.659 --> 08:44.410
Yeah.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.730
She's a sure thing, mate.

08:46.948 --> 08:47.983
Enjoy.

08:48.272 --> 08:50.948
She'll even give you a good
ass-licking if you like.

08:51.321 --> 08:54.481
After a bit of exercise, it's quite nice.

08:54.764 --> 08:56.217
What?

08:56.250 --> 08:58.619
Don't knock it till you
tried it, pal, all right?

09:03.891 --> 09:06.137
No more hookers. You hear me?

09:06.320 --> 09:07.954
Fine. I'm fucking broke anyway.

09:07.996 --> 09:09.954
- It's not about the money.
- I know.

09:10.243 --> 09:11.756
I'm a fucking criminal now... I get it.

09:11.806 --> 09:13.425
It's not about breaking the law either.

09:14.313 --> 09:15.594
You need to have something approaching

09:15.615 --> 09:17.524
a real human relationship with someone.

09:17.552 --> 09:19.214
You can't just keep paying for body parts.

09:19.256 --> 09:20.580
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

09:20.608 --> 09:22.651
You're a handsome guy
with a great fucking body.

09:22.672 --> 09:23.757
Why, thank you.

09:23.799 --> 09:25.059
I'm in really good shape right now,

09:25.080 --> 09:26.721
but my looks are a serious problem.

09:26.784 --> 09:28.106
And I sweat way too fucking much.

09:28.143 --> 09:29.748
Girls don't like clammy
hands on their tits.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.588
- That's a fact.
- [Sighs]

09:32.241 --> 09:35.664
Hey, isn't that that girl
from that time? Remember?

09:35.697 --> 09:37.974
Oh, yeah, the one who
wanted a photo with you

09:38.002 --> 09:39.882
because you were famous
for fucking your students?

09:39.917 --> 09:41.213
Yeah, that made me feel awesome.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.755
- Good times, dad.
- You should go talk to her.

09:42.797 --> 09:43.772
She's all by her lonesome over there.

09:43.952 --> 09:45.452
- Go on.
- She's not really my type.

09:45.509 --> 09:46.833
You don't have a type.

09:46.882 --> 09:48.396
Sure I do. Everyone has a type.

09:48.438 --> 09:49.474
Well, you shouldn't.

09:49.594 --> 09:50.375
You should be open

09:50.382 --> 09:53.262
to anything with a couple
"X" chromosomes, dude.

09:54.516 --> 09:56.192
Shit, she's staring right at me.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.324
- What do I do?
- [Mockingly] Aah!

09:57.357 --> 09:58.565
Wave at her.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.438
No, not like the Queen of England.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.928
Come here. Come with me.

10:02.142 --> 10:04.305
Look, somewhere inside you

10:04.338 --> 10:06.340
is the courage to put yourself out there.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.467
- Now reach in and grab it.
- Okay.

10:08.488 --> 10:12.005
Be funny, be charming,
be bold, motherfucker.

10:12.299 --> 10:14.263
- Hey, hey.
- What's up, prof?

10:14.383 --> 10:16.355
Nothing much, former student...

10:16.475 --> 10:18.905
Whose name I can't recall at this time.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.074
Apologies. You remember Levon.

10:20.116 --> 10:22.321
Yeah, you're the actor guy, right?

10:22.335 --> 10:23.701
- Not really, no.
- Yeah.

10:23.821 --> 10:25.021
Ow.

10:25.054 --> 10:27.624
- Okay, aspiring actor, yes.
- Right.

10:27.976 --> 10:29.592
You're Tara, right?

10:29.625 --> 10:31.590
- You remembered.
- Yeah.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.724
I went to school with
this chick named Sara.

10:33.757 --> 10:35.778
She was retarded.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.299
Sorry. I guess you're not
supposed to say that anymore,

10:39.335 --> 10:42.130
but she was seriously mentally handicapped,

10:42.159 --> 10:43.617
like, really fucking tweaked.

10:43.617 --> 10:44.891
All the kids made fun of her and shit.

10:44.941 --> 10:47.140
I didn't because I always
felt pretty retarded myself.

10:47.701 --> 10:48.856
That's how I remembered.

10:48.877 --> 10:52.715
Sara, Tara... not that you're
retarded or tweaked or anything.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.842
Thank you.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.118
[Sighs]

10:58.434 --> 10:59.969
No, you're not like that at all.

11:00.018 --> 11:01.265
You're really pretty,

11:01.286 --> 11:02.490
and not in a generic way, like,

11:02.490 --> 11:04.201
"oh, you're so pretty,
do you want to dance?"

11:04.237 --> 11:06.060
You're, like, uniquely pretty.

11:06.093 --> 11:07.460
Like, there's probably no other girl

11:07.493 --> 11:08.996
in the world who looks exactly like you.

11:09.426 --> 11:11.525
And you've got this really cool vibe.

11:12.025 --> 11:13.298
You make me feel good...

11:13.331 --> 11:15.570
not in a creepy "my wiener
feels weird" kind of way.

11:15.690 --> 11:17.801
Like, happy good.

11:18.425 --> 11:20.798
It makes me want to get to know you better.

11:21.354 --> 11:23.685
Would you have a drink with me, Tara?

11:27.639 --> 11:29.031
Sure, Levon.

11:29.066 --> 11:32.256
- I'll have my own, but sure.
- Okay.

11:33.073 --> 11:35.573
I'm just gonna run to the
restroom real quick, okay?

11:36.129 --> 11:38.425
Hey, if you don't come back, it was

11:38.460 --> 11:39.932
nice to see you again.

11:40.150 --> 11:42.353
I'll be back, Levon. I promise.

11:42.386 --> 11:44.987
Cool.

11:45.419 --> 11:47.010
Watch out for the toilet paper.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.081
- Shh.
- It's rough stuff.

11:53.038 --> 11:56.836
Pow, pow, pow. [Laughs]

11:56.869 --> 11:58.559
I like how she says my name.

11:58.679 --> 12:00.373
That's the way it starts, my friend.

12:00.602 --> 12:02.229
- You did good.
- Thanks.

12:02.257 --> 12:03.503
Here, drinks are on me.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.285
Try to make it to dinner, okay?

12:05.334 --> 12:06.937
Dude, if I can get her
to have dinner with me,

12:06.978 --> 12:08.207
I can probably bang her outright...

12:08.242 --> 12:09.609
- No banging.
- No banging?

12:09.623 --> 12:11.345
Just talking, all right?

12:11.465 --> 12:12.530
What about fingering?

12:12.544 --> 12:13.636
I will break that finger right off.

12:13.671 --> 12:15.616
- [Yelps]
- Just enjoy her.

12:15.649 --> 12:18.502
And let her enjoy you, okay? All right?

12:18.741 --> 12:20.354
Try not to fart.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.424
I love you, you know that?

12:22.544 --> 12:24.892
I do. And I fucking love you too, dad.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.960
Good. Good, good, good.

12:27.016 --> 12:28.783
Having a dad is fucking awesome.

12:28.812 --> 12:30.502
Don't cry. Here she comes.

12:30.558 --> 12:31.572
I'm around if you need me.

12:31.579 --> 12:33.001
- Call me. Titty twister.
- Ow.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.881
You're back.

12:35.902 --> 12:38.274
- Hey.
- I just need one of those.

12:38.307 --> 12:40.743
Dirty old game they call pool, huh?

12:40.776 --> 12:42.912
Yeah, show me your best.

12:43.032 --> 12:45.744
- Okay. Oh, right there.
- The white one's the cue ball.

12:45.777 --> 12:49.788
- I'll be the stripes.
- [Billiard balls clack]

12:53.987 --> 12:56.322
[Door opens] Hey.

12:56.363 --> 12:58.624
- I think he's gonna be all right.
- Where is he?

12:58.657 --> 13:00.495
- He's with a girl.
- Alone?

13:00.528 --> 13:01.759
No, he's in a bar,

13:01.792 --> 13:03.576
just like us once upon a time.

13:03.611 --> 13:05.133
- Did you pay her?
- Not a dime.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.294
- No, he did it all himself.
- Oh, that's good.

13:07.414 --> 13:08.329
Yeah.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.338
I hope he doesn't take his penis out.

13:10.371 --> 13:13.040
I hope he does... at the appropriate time.

13:13.076 --> 13:14.963
No, seriously, Julia,

13:15.252 --> 13:16.716
I think he's gonna be fine.

13:16.836 --> 13:18.474
I really do.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.042
No, honestly, getting to know him, just...

13:21.162 --> 13:22.893
he's been maybe

13:22.905 --> 13:25.206
the most pleasant
surprise of my adult life.

13:25.428 --> 13:27.142
Mm.

13:27.175 --> 13:28.942
Thank you.

13:29.978 --> 13:31.197
I know the feeling.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.021
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

13:41.325 --> 13:42.656
Wait. Hold on.

13:43.051 --> 13:44.600
Don't you fucking cock-block yourself.

13:44.621 --> 13:46.016
No, no, no, I want to do this right.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.197
You mean, like, with protection?

13:48.227 --> 13:49.516
I think I have condoms somewhere.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.987
No, no, no, I want to
take you out to dinner...

13:52.192 --> 13:54.019
Tonight, all right?

13:54.607 --> 13:55.635
I like dinner.

13:55.663 --> 13:56.557
- You like dinner?
- Mm-hmm.

13:56.593 --> 13:57.776
All right, that settles it, then.

13:57.797 --> 13:59.734
- Okay.
- We're on, all right.

14:01.220 --> 14:04.621
Oh, wear your best dress.
Leave those underwear at home.

14:04.659 --> 14:07.033
[Both laugh]

14:17.774 --> 14:19.373
Kruller, looking good.

14:19.406 --> 14:20.150
Hello, Hank.

14:20.270 --> 14:22.981
- Where's Baldo?
- He's in the guest room.

14:23.312 --> 14:25.030
Say hello to Love.

14:25.227 --> 14:26.734
- Hello, Love.
- Hello.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.411
- As you were.
- All right.

14:28.686 --> 14:29.885
- [Moans]
- That's it.

14:29.919 --> 14:31.085
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:31.118 --> 14:32.192
Ooh.

14:32.312 --> 14:34.228
Oh, what the fuck is this?

14:34.256 --> 14:35.653
What does it look like?

14:35.686 --> 14:37.010
Why in my bedroom?

14:37.291 --> 14:39.630
I can't fuck another woman
in my marital bed, Hank.

14:39.663 --> 14:41.587
- That's sick.
- Class up the ass, Runks...

14:41.622 --> 14:43.298
class up the fucking ass.

14:43.418 --> 14:45.890
You shouldn't have done
this. It's not worth it.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.172
This shit is never worth
it... no disrespect, Milady.

14:48.292 --> 14:50.757
- You are a work of art.
- Thank you.

14:51.109 --> 14:53.989
- I didn't do anything, Hank.
- Yeah, he couldn't get it up.

14:54.031 --> 14:55.144
I did everything I could.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.109
It was like nibbling on
a piece of string cheese.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.102
It's really making me
question my chosen career path.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.926
No, no, no, it's not you.

15:00.954 --> 15:03.144
But you really should consider
going back to law school.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.088
It's definitely not you.

15:05.116 --> 15:06.834
This kid is an absolute fucking mess,

15:06.854 --> 15:08.954
but you should go back to school.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.516
Now, this is great news, Runks.

15:10.636 --> 15:12.939
Put your limp dick away,
get in your girly car,

15:12.939 --> 15:14.517
and drive up to Stu's posthaste.

15:14.517 --> 15:15.828
You got to put an end to this shit.

15:15.861 --> 15:17.525
You'll thank me later. You are welcome.

15:17.558 --> 15:19.214
She probably already fucked him, Hank...

15:19.242 --> 15:21.024
- twice, three times.
- Four times a lady.

15:21.031 --> 15:22.587
You'll never know if you don't try.

15:22.636 --> 15:24.489
Now be bold, you fucking ninny.

15:25.034 --> 15:27.869
There you go. Put some clothes on.

15:27.904 --> 15:29.615
You look like someone
dragged you out of the river.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.323
I'm sorry it didn't work out,

15:31.327 --> 15:33.474
but we could get together
sometime for lunch maybe,

15:33.507 --> 15:34.844
with my wife or not.

15:34.877 --> 15:36.713
We'll see. We'll see.

15:37.122 --> 15:39.747
Um, hey, would you mind
if I practice on you?

15:39.780 --> 15:41.385
- Practice what?
- Sex.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.262
- Oh...
- Thanks for everything, Krull.

15:43.325 --> 15:44.558
That is tempting.

15:45.051 --> 15:47.322
But, you know, I've already
turned down sex once today,

15:47.355 --> 15:48.993
and I think I can do it again.

15:49.026 --> 15:50.392
Are you sure?

15:50.425 --> 15:52.488
- Yeah.
- Aw.

15:52.529 --> 15:53.560
- No.
- No?

15:53.593 --> 15:55.264
Yeah. No.

15:55.298 --> 15:56.497
Yes.

15:56.530 --> 15:57.671
No.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.016
Yes. Be gone, Harlot.

16:00.136 --> 16:01.333
I've got writing to do.

16:01.371 --> 16:03.306
And get your ass back in school.

16:11.781 --> 16:15.363
- We have done it all, Marcy.
- [Sighs]

16:15.483 --> 16:17.912
We swam. We played tennis. We had lunch.

16:17.953 --> 16:20.615
We meditated. We did some
yoga. We had massages.

16:20.648 --> 16:22.714
The only things we haven't done is fuck!

16:23.791 --> 16:26.821
My balls are so swollen right now.

16:26.854 --> 16:29.257
- [Clears throat]
- Please...

16:29.726 --> 16:32.186
[Sighs] Take me in your mouth.

16:32.229 --> 16:33.616
What?

16:33.658 --> 16:36.458
The contract doesn't say
anything about blow jobs, Stu.

16:36.499 --> 16:37.799
Intercourse only.

16:37.828 --> 16:40.499
Hey, hey, blow jobs are implied.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.088
Get a better lawyer.

16:42.095 --> 16:42.940
Okay, fine.

16:42.982 --> 16:45.276
Is it all right if I penetrate you, then?

16:45.609 --> 16:47.757
I just feel so weird about all this.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.109
Well, of course it's weird.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.018
It's like riding a bicycle.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.110
I mean, once big daddy
enters the rain forest,

16:56.124 --> 16:58.082
all will be right with the world.

16:59.021 --> 16:59.885
You know what?

17:00.005 --> 17:02.390
I have to check and see
if the money transferred.

17:02.423 --> 17:04.856
- You don't trust me!
- Why would I trust you?

17:04.919 --> 17:06.750
You're a fucking crazy person, Stu.

17:06.763 --> 17:09.201
You go ahead and check. I have to pee.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.082
Do you know how difficult it is to urinate

17:12.107 --> 17:14.872
with an erection this size?

17:26.602 --> 17:29.489
What the actual fuck?

17:38.353 --> 17:41.099
What the fuck is this?

17:41.599 --> 17:44.036
Oh. Um...

17:45.217 --> 17:46.858
this is quite embarrassing.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.282
Not to mention really fucking creepy.

17:49.331 --> 17:53.269
You know, this is not as
creepy as you may think.

17:53.867 --> 17:57.269
She is my loving tribute to you.

17:57.302 --> 17:58.974
Isn't she beautiful?

17:59.007 --> 18:00.818
She's a fuck doll, Stu.

18:00.825 --> 18:04.459
She's an expensive fuck doll... 15 large.

18:04.473 --> 18:05.691
But...

18:06.918 --> 18:08.735
But she's so much more than that.

18:09.751 --> 18:12.220
She's a woman, just like you.

18:12.922 --> 18:16.319
And I have made love to her,
just like I made love to you.

18:16.868 --> 18:18.730
Want me to show you?

18:18.764 --> 18:22.298
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
This is too fucking weird.

18:22.339 --> 18:23.835
You need help, Stu.

18:23.868 --> 18:26.066
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Marcy, Marcy. No, no! No.

18:26.108 --> 18:27.990
Don't... don't go. Don't go.

18:28.003 --> 18:29.672
Look, I paid you a million dollars

18:29.679 --> 18:31.182
so I could fuck you, woman.

18:31.215 --> 18:33.183
The least you could do is let me fuck you.

18:33.216 --> 18:34.341
Come here.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.150
- No, don't fight it.
- Oh, oh.

18:36.207 --> 18:37.351
Don't fight it.

18:37.391 --> 18:39.507
I will pepper you with kisses,

18:39.532 --> 18:41.697
and you will remember what it is like...

18:43.363 --> 18:44.934
Oh, come on, Marcy!

18:44.967 --> 18:46.639
How many rape games have we played?

18:46.672 --> 18:48.606
Requested by you, no less.

18:48.639 --> 18:51.206
Those are games, Stu!

- Ow!

18:53.017 --> 18:54.513
Is that the safe word?

18:55.639 --> 18:57.184
Don't do it, Marcy!

18:57.217 --> 18:58.569
Oh!

18:58.889 --> 19:00.890
Oh, my God.

19:00.923 --> 19:02.627
I was totally hoping that you would make

19:02.660 --> 19:04.366
some lame attempt to rescue me.

19:04.399 --> 19:06.872
Am I too late? Did you guys already fuck?

19:06.905 --> 19:08.369
No!

19:08.402 --> 19:09.570

You mean, like, anal?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.471
No, he didn't even finger me.

19:19.513 --> 19:20.894
I didn't.

19:21.014 --> 19:23.094
And things got so weird

19:23.127 --> 19:26.676
because I found that fucking

19:26.690 --> 19:28.690
Solid. I'd throw a shot into her.

19:28.810 --> 19:31.984
Uh, look, guys, you know, this is obviously

19:32.007 --> 19:33.503
a really terrible idea.

19:33.536 --> 19:35.330
Uh, look...

19:35.380 --> 19:37.606

19:52.717 --> 19:54.083
You fucked with our marriage.

19:54.124 --> 19:56.019
I could sue you for
alienation of affection.

19:56.060 --> 19:58.123
Yeah, and you would lose, motherfucker.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.894
Maybe, but I could still leak a story

19:59.926 --> 20:01.892
about a freaky, washed-up producer

20:01.933 --> 20:04.130
who's into prostitutes and sex dolls.

20:04.163 --> 20:05.529

20:14.076 --> 20:15.211
Good for you!

20:15.803 --> 20:18.782
Listen, I realize I have sinned.

20:18.816 --> 20:20.552

20:20.585 --> 20:21.983
I'm sorry, guys.
