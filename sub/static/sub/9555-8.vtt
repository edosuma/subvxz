01:40.601 --> 01:41.966
- Here you are, Rich.
- Oh.

01:42.069 --> 01:47.303
A double, quadruple scoop
Alfredo deluxe-o sundae.

01:47.407 --> 01:48.499

Hey.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.873
Oh, are you
celebrating something?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.503
Yeah.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.876
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.348
(laughs)

01:56.450 --> 01:58.782
No, after much hard work
and diligence,

01:58.885 --> 02:00.751
well, the kid
came through again.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.253
(phone ringing)

02:02.356 --> 02:03.846
That's the telephone.
I'll get it.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.118
- Don't go away.
- My sun... hey, Al,

02:05.225 --> 02:06.624
-(ringing continues)
-you got my...

02:06.727 --> 02:08.252
"Yello."

02:08.362 --> 02:10.126
Yeah. Uh-huh.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.197
He's right here.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.356
Rich, it's for you.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.958
Oh, great.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.467
You must have done
something great.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.560
It's the newspaper.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.797
Oh, really?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.304
Hello.

02:20.407 --> 02:23.035
Oh, yeah, it's the professor
of the UWM Daily Post.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.372
-(excited chatter)
- AL: UMW Daily Post...!

02:24.478 --> 02:25.468
Yes, sir.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.014
Yes, sir, this is
Richard Cunningham.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.174
Yes, the new science editor.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.773
(whispers):
The science editor.

02:31.885 --> 02:35.321
What?

02:35.422 --> 02:37.390
You're killing my first story?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.481
Why?

02:38.592 --> 02:39.889
- Al...
- Ask him.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.427
Why?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.360
Uh-huh.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.455
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.728
Uh-huh.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.327
All those reasons, huh?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.997
Yeah. Yes, sir.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.541
I'll-I'll get right on
another story.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.339
Yes, sir, thank you.

03:00.414 --> 03:03.076
Well, Rich, at least
you're the science editor.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.344
(whispers):
He's the science...

03:04.451 --> 03:05.976
Al, look, I kind of
lost my appetite,

03:06.086 --> 03:09.954
so would you mind just kind of
canceling the sundae there?

03:10.057 --> 03:14.392
Rich, I can't cancel
an Alfredo deluxe-o...

03:19.066 --> 03:21.000
Ew, I don't like mint.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.502
Canceled my first story.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.970
How can they turn down a story
with a hook like that?

03:26.073 --> 03:29.065
"Fruit Fly, Friend or Foe?"

03:31.311 --> 03:33.575
Oh, just forget it.
I hate science.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.671
Hey, Cunningham.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.285
Just the man I want to see.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.584
Let me ask you a question.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.125
Can you visualize this face
up on Mount Rushmore?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.058
Right next to Lincoln--
you know, he's my favorite.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.253
- Oh, yeah?
- He's my favorite.

03:49.362 --> 03:50.659
You still writing
for that paper?

03:50.764 --> 03:53.096
Yeah. Matter of fact, they made
me the, uh, science editor.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.497
Science editor-- hey, congrats.

03:54.601 --> 03:55.500
Thanks.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.502
Have I got a story for you.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.503
You got a story?

03:58.605 --> 03:59.868
Great! Great, I need one.

03:59.973 --> 04:00.963
All right, all right.

04:01.074 --> 04:05.272
Uh, who? What? Why?
Where? When? How?

04:05.378 --> 04:08.507
Me, in a half an hour,
set a record,

04:08.615 --> 04:12.051
Inspiration Point, on my bike,
'cause it's there to do.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.350
Yeah, that... that's great.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.446
Uh, Fonz, could you fill in
with a little more detail?

04:17.557 --> 04:18.922
Yeah, absolutely.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.685
All right. Dig this.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.526
I'm up on Inspiration Point
with three fabulous chicks.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.065
Uh, three girls on a bike?

04:26.166 --> 04:29.796
That's right. All of a sudden,
a wild urge overtakes me.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.871
Oh, yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.067
Not that kind of urge.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.371
An urge to set a new record.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.502
You see, I figured I've already
got Miller's Road, right?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.512
Yeah.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.979
So, I'm gonna go down

04:42.082 --> 04:44.141
the other side
of Inspiration Point.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.083
Fonz, the other side?

04:46.186 --> 04:48.086
(descending whistle)

04:48.188 --> 04:50.179
(imitates explosion)

04:52.626 --> 04:53.559
A little less.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.559
(imitates smaller explosion)

04:54.661 --> 04:56.629
Exactamundo! Exactamundo!

04:56.730 --> 04:57.629
All right, dig it.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.699
I can see the headlines now.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.632
"The Fonz Goes..."
You know, what you just did.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.998
- Right. -Are you getting
this down, Rich?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.696
- Oh, I got it.
- Are you getting this down?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.035
All right, start to visualize

05:07.140 --> 05:09.507
three fabulous chicks
on a bike, right?

05:09.609 --> 05:10.872
Three chicks on a bike?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.206
On the handlebars.
On the handlebars.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.679
Oh, oh, right.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.478
Three fabulous chicks
on a bike, going down.

05:17.584 --> 05:18.574
{descending whistle)
- Right?

05:18.685 --> 05:20.585
All of a sudden,
a blur of rocks, you know?

05:20.687 --> 05:23.156
And trees coming at me,
flailing arms.

05:23.256 --> 05:27.693
And then I hear somebody yell,
"Hey, Fonz, don't do it."

05:27.794 --> 05:29.125
Rich, I got to tell you,

05:29.229 --> 05:31.129
the first time in my life
I ever heard those words.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.528
(chuckles)

05:32.632 --> 05:35.124
Yeah.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.725
Fonz, the record--

05:36.837 --> 05:38.931
it's fantastic and it would make
a great story,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.268
but I can't write it.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.364
Hey, what are you, nutso?
Get over here.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.636
It's got a little of everything.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.905
You got drama, you got fear,
you got excitement,

05:46.012 --> 05:49.243
you got a little romance there,
plus a new record.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.113
Yeah. Fonz, it's not science.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.879
I... All right, all right.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.420
Uh, where are
the three girls now?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.818
Well, they're still
on the handlebars;

05:55.922 --> 05:57.412
I couldn't pry
their fingers off.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.151
(both laugh)

05:59.259 --> 06:00.658
- I was only kidding, you know.
- Yeah.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.058
You should have seen
the fear on their faces.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.631
Fear, yeah.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.221
- Wait a minute.
- Hmm?

06:06.333 --> 06:07.732
- That might be a story.
- Right.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.166
Fear! I mean,
everybody has fears, right?

06:10.270 --> 06:12.932
I'll pretend
you didn't say that.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.131
Oh...

06:14.241 --> 06:16.039
Come on, Fonz, a little fear.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.873
Maybe when I was four.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.378
Four. Four.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.470
All right, what did you have?

06:21.581 --> 06:22.912
Were you afraid of the dark?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.609
No, you were scared of storms.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.981
You were afraid of...

06:26.086 --> 06:27.144
Go ahead, Fonz.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.124
I was afraid that...

06:32.225 --> 06:34.284
I'd never have a girlfriend,
you know?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.123
It went right away.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.199
Went right away like that
when I met the Muldoon triplets.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.393
Four years old?

06:41.501 --> 06:42.832
- That's right.
- Triplets.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.065
And could those girls
play doctor.

06:46.172 --> 06:47.970
(chuckles)

06:48.074 --> 06:49.803
All right, Fonz, I got to get
started on this article.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.071
Thanks for the idea.

06:51.177 --> 06:52.338
I'm sorry I can't
use yours with the...

06:52.445 --> 06:53.412
(descending whistle)

06:53.513 --> 06:54.776
Hey, that's no sweat
off my nose.

06:54.881 --> 06:58.010
You'll get my next record
with four chicks.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.142
Oh.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.152
Pike's Peak? (laughs)

07:01.254 --> 07:04.189
No, actually,
I was thinking, uh, you know...

07:06.192 --> 07:08.183
(laughs):
Ooh.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.024
You got an exclusive, all right?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.361
- All right.
- Later. Whoa!

07:13.466 --> 07:15.457
See you, Fonz.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.437
<i>MARION: Well, Richard,
I'm so proud of you.</i>

07:20.540 --> 07:22.668
<i>My science editor.</i>

07:22.776 --> 07:23.937
Oh, thanks.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.172
Well, you know,
I've worked hard,

07:26.279 --> 07:27.872
and I've done
some nice pieces and, uh...

07:27.981 --> 07:29.813
And I heard
nobody else wanted it.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.078
- Well, that, too.
- Mm-hmm.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.983
So when do you start
your first article?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.317
I already had one idea
shot down, but listen to this.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.084
I'm thinking about
doing a feature

07:38.191 --> 07:40.285
about one of the darkest corners
of the human psyche.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.861
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.589
Fears and phobias.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.062
Oh, good, Rich.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.260
You can write about
how you're afraid of flowers.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.328
I'm not afraid of flowers.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.999
Only of smelling them,
since that bumblebee incident.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.643
You shouldn't be
talking about being scared,

07:58.745 --> 08:00.270
I mean, the way you go...
(shrieks)

08:00.380 --> 08:01.939
"The bogeyman's after me!"

08:02.048 --> 08:03.413
She always does that.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.842
Listen, big brother,

08:06.953 --> 08:09.285
just because someone uses
a Yogi Bear night light

08:09.389 --> 08:11.721
does not mean she's afraid
of the bogeyman.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.089
Well, I got to tell you,
there's nothing sillier

08:14.194 --> 08:15.662
than your mother's fear
of strange bathrooms.

08:15.762 --> 08:16.957
That's right.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.555
You never can tell if somebody
is hiding in the shower.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.596
Boy, you people
and your silly fears.

08:23.703 --> 08:24.898
(laughs)

08:25.005 --> 08:26.268
Don't "you people" us.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.898
How about you and worms?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.500
I'm not afraid of worms, Marion.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.601
It's just that they're
so squishy, that's all.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.544
Uh-huh. So are jelly doughnuts,
and they don't bother you.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.047
What's jelly doughnuts
got to do with...

08:37.150 --> 08:38.275
All right, I think I got enough.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.852
Oh, don't give me any of that.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.751
(all arguing)

08:41.855 --> 08:43.254
You take a can of spray...

08:43.356 --> 08:44.687
MARION:
Oh, a bathroom?

08:44.791 --> 08:45.952
(arguing continues)

08:46.059 --> 08:47.458
Professor?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.790
Yes, sir, this is Cunningham.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.797
Well, I think
I'm onto something.

08:57.637 --> 09:01.073
Claustrophobia--
fear of enclosed places.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.608
- Nope.
- Yes.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.544
Acrophobia-- height.

09:06.646 --> 09:07.977
- Nope.
- Yes.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.008
Phobophobia-- fear of fear.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.213
- Nope.
- Yes.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.055
Ralph, I've gone through
the entire list.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.422
You have every one.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.426
Yeah.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.758
I'm an all-around guy.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.491
You know, I tell you, this story
is filling in pretty nicely.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.899
I've got, uh,
who, where, how, when...

09:30.003 --> 09:31.801
You know what I don't have? Why.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.498
Why do people have
all these fears?

09:33.606 --> 09:34.869
Well, you're in luck, Rich.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.999
I know this Austrian professor
at the psychology lab;

09:37.110 --> 09:38.441
he's got a million degrees.

09:38.545 --> 09:39.808
Head of
the psychology department?

09:39.913 --> 09:40.880
No, a custodian.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.539
Janitor. (laughs)

09:42.649 --> 09:44.708
Only because he doesn't have
U.S. credentials yet.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.081
He takes care
of the lab animals.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.085
Want to talk to him?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.245
- Yeah, come on.
- Great.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.254
This could be just what I need.
Let's go.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.654
He's probably feeding
the lab animals right now.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.692
Lab animals?

09:53.793 --> 09:55.227
Wait a minute, I can't go.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.490
I'm afraid of mice.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.122
Ralph, nothing's gonna happen.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.495
The mice are in cages.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.625
Yeah? So was King Kong at first.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.203
Come on...

10:09.175 --> 10:11.075
(Austrian accent):
Here you are, Ingrid.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.372
Here.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.469
Here, here, here.

10:13.580 --> 10:17.107
Now, Hermann,
you let Ingrid eat, ja?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.548
Uh, Dr. Himmel?

10:18.651 --> 10:20.517
- Yes?
- Uh, remember me?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.679
I thought the mice were old
'cause they had white hair.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.047
How could I forget?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.651
Well, these here are my friends,
Richie Cunningham...

10:28.761 --> 10:30.957
- How do you do? -...and, uh,
over there is Ralph Malph.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.589
And, uh, Professor...

10:32.699 --> 10:34.064
Professor, we really need
your help.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.692
Come on in, young man.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.670
Professor, do your mice
pick locks?

10:39.772 --> 10:41.866
Is he the one
you want me to help?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.704
Uh, no, Professor.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.108
Uh, I'm the science editor
of the school paper,

10:46.212 --> 10:48.806
and-and I just wanted to ask you
a question about fear.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.747
Ah, the psychology of fears.

10:50.850 --> 10:51.749
Yes.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.182
My Specialty.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.276
Oh, all right.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.912
Well, why do people
have these fears?

10:56.022 --> 10:59.185
We need some fears
to keep us in balance.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.990
Well, now, what if somebody has,
uh, too many fears?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.930
Would you call 50 too many?

11:09.035 --> 11:10.833
<i>Ja.</i>

11:10.937 --> 11:12.598
Hypnotism.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.833
I've experimented with mice,

11:14.941 --> 11:18.400
and under hypnosis,
their fears vanish.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.876
Let me demonstrate.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.538
We will use Ingrid.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.639
"Oh!
'(cage Farming)

11:24.684 --> 11:27.016
What are they doing?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.249
Well, they're moving their
little feet around like that.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.120
Well, kind of looks like...

11:32.225 --> 11:33.454
No.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.688
Yeah, it looks like
they're dancing.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.854
- Dancing?!
- Yeah.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.865
This is not the scientific term,
but, uh...

11:40.967 --> 11:42.230
Ja, ja.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.236
They're-they're agitated,
nervous, disturbed.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.638
It looks like dancing.

11:48.741 --> 11:52.803
This happened to me
only once before in my lifetime.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.971
Oh, you've been to Disneyland?

11:56.683 --> 12:00.551
All animals are sensitive
to coming disasters.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.950
Disaster?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.116
Before an earthquake,
cats and dogs begin to wail.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.423
You all know the stories of rats
leaving a ship before it sinks.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.260
But in the case of dancing mice,

12:12.365 --> 12:16.666
first, the air will grow still.

12:16.769 --> 12:19.864
Birds will be silent.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.500
And then, in the eerie quiet,

12:23.610 --> 12:26.739
it will come...

12:26.846 --> 12:29.679
at exactly 6:22 this evening.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.477
Stop it!
You're driving me crazy!

12:31.584 --> 12:32.483
Stop it!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.383
What? What will come?

12:34.487 --> 12:38.048
One of the most powerful
forces of nature.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.955
Fonzie?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.629
A destructive energy
uprooting trees,

12:43.730 --> 12:45.664
smash houses, wreak havoc!

12:45.765 --> 12:49.133
What will come,
young man, a tornado!

12:49.235 --> 12:50.225
(Ralph shrieks)

12:56.576 --> 12:57.737
A tornado.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.107
Did you hear that, Malph?

12:59.212 --> 13:01.909
Hear it?
It's ringing in my ears.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.414
Malph, there's nothing
to worry about.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.950
We haven't had
a tornado in Milwaukee

13:05.051 --> 13:06.678
-since, uh, Truman left office.
- Yeah.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.914
Yeah? Tell that to the mice.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.183
Professor Himmel,
you can't really

13:10.290 --> 13:11.985
predict anything
with mice, can you?

13:12.091 --> 13:13.320
Very good, young man.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.487
A trained scientific mind
refuses to accept one fact

13:16.596 --> 13:19.190
unless additional facts
can back it up.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.562
Check the barometer.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.465
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

13:22.568 --> 13:25.333
When's the little man
and woman come out?

13:25.438 --> 13:27.907
- Read the numbers.
- Oh. Yeah.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.499
If it is below 29,
we are in trouble.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.873
It's 28.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.878
(Ralph whimpering frantically)

13:33.980 --> 13:35.971
Now we have two facts.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.208
I wish you wouldn't say that.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.682
Now observation.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.310
Check the sky.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.185
Yeah, but, Professor,
the sun is shining and...

13:43.289 --> 13:44.723
Oh, come here, look.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.384
Look at the black clouds
coming over the horizon.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.517
Could be rain.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.789
Three facts.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.022
Shall we continue?

13:51.130 --> 13:52.655
I think not.
It's enough for me.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.700
A tornado!
Quick, grab something heavy.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.810
Is this an American custom?

14:05.912 --> 14:07.107
No, he's terrified.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.476
He's also pretty strong.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.946
Come on, Malph, let go, man.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.483
We don't have time
for your hysterics.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.609
- We've got to warn everybody.
- Forget it.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.586
I'm not going out there.
There's a tornado.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.951
Come on, Malph, let go, man.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.649
You must hurry. You must hurry.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.283
Warn everyone about the tornado.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.451
Your loved ones.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.757
Leave me alone. I'm loveless.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.592
Look, you've got to help us.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.961
I will hypnotize him.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.535
Oh, you can't do that.
My will is much too strong.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.039
Hey, that's pretty good.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.735
Hey, Pots, did you...

14:37.844 --> 14:40.370
Pots?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.244
You got two for one.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.510
Amazing.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.549
Malph must be pretty simple
to go under that fast.

14:48.654 --> 14:49.815
Yeah, right.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.356
Let's go. Come on.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.323
Now, when I awaken you,

14:53.426 --> 14:56.327
you will have no longer
fears of tornadoes.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.420
(whimpering)

15:00.133 --> 15:02.329
You won't have fear of anything.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.599
You will be without fears.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.606
You will be fearless.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.699
You understand?

15:12.044 --> 15:14.843
And now, when you awake
at the count of three,

15:14.947 --> 15:18.508
you will be feeling well
and have no longer fears.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.952
One. Two. Three.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.723
Ralph, you all right?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.954
I don't know.
I feel different.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.028
- You must warn everyone
about the tornado. -Right.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.096
Come on.
We got to warn them.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.164
- Let's go.
- Come on, Malph.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.596
I don't know what it is.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.566
I feel courageous,
fearless, strong.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.967
Out of my way, Doc.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.071
Ralph. Ralph.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.301
- Right, not strong.
- Yeah.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.639
- Come on.
- Two out of three, Rich.

15:49.816 --> 15:53.616
22 cents for a loaf of bread.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.585
What is this world coming to?

15:55.688 --> 15:58.282
Howard, it's the Russians.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.952
Ever since that dog in space,
things haven't been the same.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.324
Oh, oh, good.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.919
I'm glad you're here.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.465
I got all our valuables
right here.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.091
I opened up all the windows
upstairs.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.396
You got groceries.
Excellent.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.628
We're gonna need
some canned goods.

16:10.736 --> 16:11.862
I hope you got canned goods.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.666
Okay, Dad, listen,
could you pour some water?

16:13.773 --> 16:15.537
I'm gonna open up
all the windows down here,

16:15.641 --> 16:17.109
and-and, Mom,
maybe you could, uh...

16:17.210 --> 16:18.302
Could you get the pillow...?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.402
Richard, what is going on here?

16:20.513 --> 16:21.708
Don't just stand here.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.213
There's gonna be a tornado.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.784
It's the Russians.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.645
A tornado? What tornado?

16:28.754 --> 16:30.483
Professor Himmel
at the university told us

16:30.590 --> 16:32.649
there's gonna be
a tornado at 6:22.

16:32.758 --> 16:35.420
- Oh, right, I better get
the canned goods. -Right.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.155
Well, who told him?

16:37.263 --> 16:39.163
Uh, well, uh, observation.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.290
The barometer,
the... the dancing mice.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.835
Dancing mice?

16:44.937 --> 16:46.735
All right, cancel the mice.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.967
Look, I don't have a lot of time
to argue about this.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.009
Now, are you two gonna
get down in the cellar, or...

16:51.110 --> 16:52.339
do I have to get physical?

16:52.445 --> 16:53.674
Marion...

16:53.779 --> 16:55.406
will you call Dr. Strock?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.108
I don't think he's well.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.308
I'm doing fine,

16:58.417 --> 17:00.010
but I'm telling you,
a tornado is coming.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.348
RALPH:
That's right.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.913
And it's a lovely day
for a big wind.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.252
You got a kite, Howie?

17:06.358 --> 17:09.920
Howard, I don't think Ralph
is feeling well.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.723
Oh, don't worry, Mrs. C.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.799
It's just Ralph's hypnotized
like the mice.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.425
More mice.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.502
Look, did you warn your family?

17:17.603 --> 17:20.867
My family's in the cellar,
the sniveling cowards.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.270
I tried.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.867
But my father just told me
to stand outside as a lookout.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.339
Look, I'm going down
to Arnold's,

17:28.446 --> 17:29.710
we're gonna warn
everybody down there,

17:29.815 --> 17:31.806
and I'm also gonna get Joanie
and bring her back.

17:31.918 --> 17:35.548
Oh, Mom, Dad, what can I say
at a time like this?

17:37.089 --> 17:38.853
Say good-bye, Richard.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.585
Oh, right, bye.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.388
Good-bye, Mom.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.429
You're good people.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.622
Come on.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.866
Oh, Howard, do you think

17:50.970 --> 17:52.870
there really is
going to be a tornado?

17:52.972 --> 17:54.269
Of course not.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.000
ANNOUNCER (over radio):
And that's today's weather.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.803
And now for tomorrow's weather.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.674
Fair and sunny through the end
of the week...

17:59.779 --> 18:01.110
Well, that's a relief.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.977
(over radio): Wait. I've just
been handed a bulletin.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.447
There's a tornado warning
in effect

18:04.550 --> 18:06.109
in this area until 8:00 tonight.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.209
Richard! Richard!

18:09.722 --> 18:11.747
Just missed him.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.455
Hey, hey, run for your life.

18:16.562 --> 18:17.757
A tornado's coming.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.093
(others laughing)

18:21.367 --> 18:23.495
Run for your life.
A tornado's coming.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.594
(others gasping, screaming)

18:28.207 --> 18:29.368
RALPH:
Hey, wait a minute!

18:29.475 --> 18:31.773
- Everybody out.
- Baby, baby, baby, wait, wait!

18:31.877 --> 18:33.538
Wait for me
at Inspiration Point.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.580
We'll watch
the destruction together.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.206
(screams)

18:37.316 --> 18:38.784
Just as well.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.114
It's tough to kiss
a screaming girl.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.348
Al, Al, there's gonna
be a tornado.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.515
- Hey, Al.
- Aah!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.719
I'm hungry.
Business before terror.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.454
Al, just grab anything you can.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.394
Quick.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.522
Why are you taking
a napkin holder?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.624
So shoot me, I'm sentimental.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.897
Al, bring me a wine list.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.039
Hey, come on,
you got to get out of here.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.108
There's a tornado.
Really, just-just go.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.699
- Oh, Joanie.
- What's going on here?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.505
- Is there a fire?
- Come on.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.603
Oh, oh, much better--
there's a tornado coming.

19:08.714 --> 19:09.977
Cut the comedy, Ralph.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.709
Look, take the keys,
get in my car

19:11.817 --> 19:13.342
and drive home
as fast as you can.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.613
- You're giving me your car?
- Yeah.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.188
Oh, there must be a tornado!

19:16.288 --> 19:17.414
- Go!
- Tornado!

19:17.523 --> 19:18.615
- Quick! Let's warn everyone
- Yeah.

19:18.724 --> 19:19.850
- Down at the Pizza Bowl.
- Right.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.484
But, Rich, this time
you do the talking.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.562
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's the big hurry?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.688
Let me make a few calls first
in my office.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.425
- Ralph, that's Fonzie's office.
- Ralph.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.557
(laughs)

19:28.668 --> 19:30.602
Not anymore.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.905
Fonz.

19:39.278 --> 19:40.746
Fonzie.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.075
Control.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.317
Just keep control, Fonz.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.350
That's good, Fonz.
Just stay cool.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.358
I'm cool.
I'm in control. I'm in control.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.428
I'm gonna give you a minute
to call an ambulance

19:56.529 --> 19:58.122
and then his best...
his next of kin.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.755
On second thought,
I'm gonna go in there,

19:59.865 --> 20:01.959
I'm gonna stuff that kamikaze
kid right down the drain.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.126
No, wait, Fonz, Fonz!

20:03.235 --> 20:04.430
Look, he's not himself.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.595
Why would you do that?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.503
The drain ain't big enough
for two of you.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.836
Oh, I'm sorry, Fonz, but...

20:09.942 --> 20:12.377
he's been hypnotized.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.912
- He's been hypnotized?
- Yeah.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.448
Well, I sure do hope that it
makes him immune to pain.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.074
Now, excuse.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.050
Fonz, Fonz, Fonz,
please don't kill him.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.644
He's my best friend.
He's my roommate.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.089
I am in dire need
of an explanation here.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.353
- Rich. Tell him. Tell him.
- Yeah, right.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.621
Uh, Fonz,
he doesn't know what he's doing

20:28.728 --> 20:29.854
because a professor
with four degrees hypnotized him

20:29.962 --> 20:31.361
so he wouldn't be afraid
of the tornado.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.590
- Right.
- There's a tornado coming, Fonz.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.188
And he knew there was
a tornado coming

20:34.300 --> 20:35.563
because the mice were dancing.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.603
Well, I guess
you had to be there.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.196
But they were dancing.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.037
Oh, there you are, Fonzarelli.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.201
Ralph.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.678
Now, before I take over
your office,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.839
I want it spic and span.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.418
I mean, get those stupid combs
out of there.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.282
Hypnotism. It's hypnotism.

20:54.386 --> 20:55.979
And another thing, Artie.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.585
Artie?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.362
That's right. That's right.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.591
You heard me, Artie.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.861
Artie, Artie, Artie, Artie...

21:08.968 --> 21:10.026
- Ralph!
- Just shut up.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.695
All right, all right, look,
calm is nice.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.531
And another thing, Artie...

21:14.640 --> 21:16.540
(grunts)

21:16.642 --> 21:18.633
You really
been bugging me lately.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.803
The way you ride that stupid
motorcycle of yours.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.644
(grunts)

21:23.749 --> 21:25.547
When you gonna get
some training wheels?

21:25.651 --> 21:26.743
Malph! He's leaving.
He's leaving.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.513
- Ralph, come on. Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.055
I didn't say anything
about his crummy jacket yet.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.056
<i>“Mph!</i>

21:32.158 --> 21:34.752
We're getting him
unhypnotized, Fonz.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.100
Whoa!

21:45.204 --> 21:47.764
(banging, jukebox playing,
phone ringing)

21:50.042 --> 21:52.409
The tornado's here!

21:53.345 --> 21:54.835
Don't worry, Ingrid.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.938
You'll be safe in here.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.539
- Professor Himmel.
- Yeah?

21:58.651 --> 21:59.914
You got to do something.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.145
You've created a monster.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.812
You heard about that?

22:04.123 --> 22:06.217
Ralph. You got to get him
out of this...

22:06.325 --> 22:07.690
-this hypnosis.
- Fast.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.989
Whatever you want,
nothing to it.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.354
That's fast.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.489
You will no longer be brave,

22:14.600 --> 22:16.227
courageous and bold.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.636
You will be the old,
uh, uh, um, uh...

22:20.739 --> 22:22.434
Ralph Malph.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.805
Ralph Malph. What a name.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.275
Wake up, kid.

22:27.313 --> 22:28.371
Hi, there.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.845
Does anyone know
what time it is?

22:29.949 --> 22:31.883
Yeah, yeah, it's 6:23.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.043
(shrieks)
Tornado time!

22:34.153 --> 22:36.588
Rich, we're gonna be sucked up
to the Land of Oz.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.123
- No, Ralph...
- Help! Help!

22:38.224 --> 22:40.921
- Mice!
- Ralph, Ralph, it's all right.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.926
It's a minute past tornado time.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.019
- It's 6:23.
- Hey, calm down, Malph.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.724
- Himmel was wrong.
- Hang on.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.858
The facts were wrong.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.733
Yeah, right, yeah.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.828
(wind howling)

23:01.513 --> 23:03.572
Missed by that much.

23:03.682 --> 23:05.673
Hit the deck!

23:09.755 --> 23:11.621
RICHIE:
Ralph!

23:11.724 --> 23:12.919
(gasps. yelps)

23:13.025 --> 23:14.618
Ralph!

23:14.727 --> 23:16.217
(shrieks)

23:16.328 --> 23:18.262
I got to get out of here!

23:18.364 --> 23:19.798
(shrieks)

23:19.899 --> 23:21.264
Auntie Em!
(shrieks)

23:21.367 --> 23:22.835
Go get him.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.664
(screaming)

23:24.770 --> 23:27.137
Hey, Ralph, I'll save you.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.263
-(screaming)
- I'll save you.

23:28.374 --> 23:29.432
Wait a minute! Wait!

23:29.541 --> 23:31.066
The wall!
Look at the wall!

23:40.753 --> 23:42.221
Hey. Malph...

23:42.321 --> 23:44.585
Malph, you saved Richie's life.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.124
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

23:46.225 --> 23:47.317
Amazing.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.053
Ralph. Thank you.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.653
Now, you see, you...
you got courage.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.357
I do?
Yeah, when you need it.

23:53.465 --> 23:54.990
- Yeah, maybe I do.
- You sure do!

23:56.368 --> 23:58.462
- Amazing.
- RICHIE: Huh?

23:58.570 --> 24:00.538
Ingrid, what did you do
with your tail?

24:01.807 --> 24:03.832
This happened to me
only once before in my life.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.207
Let's get out of here!

24:16.155 --> 24:18.249
"And therefore,
fears are our friends."

24:18.357 --> 24:20.155
Boy, that's some article, Rich.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.023
It almost makes you want
to be in a tornado.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.027
You were, Potsie.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.119
I forgot.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.226
- Oh, that hypnosis part, that
was amazing. -RICHIE: Yeah.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.737
Yeah, and to think all
the guy did was just this.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.870
Hey, good evening, my family.

24:38.978 --> 24:39.877
- Aw...
- Fonz.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.344
How are you, Mrs. C.?

24:41.447 --> 24:43.313
Oh, there you are, Artie.

24:43.415 --> 24:46.112
Now, about that
crummy jacket of yours.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.516
Say good-bye, Ralph.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.782
