WEBVTT

00:04.213 --> 00:06.501
Bourbon! You can keep the ice.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.047
Hey, Boyd.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.424
You mind?

00:14.056 --> 00:16.094
Not at all, Dewey Crowe.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.268
Kind of surprised to see you in here.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.601
I thought you'd given up these poisons.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.141
Well, I had.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.317
But many things have changed
since last we spoke.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.487
You mean when you
pointed your gun at me?

00:30.989 --> 00:36.825
Well, the irony in that is that
without me pointing my gun at you,

00:37.788 --> 00:39.994
you wouldn't be alive today.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.704
$3.25.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.713
There's 25, 35...

00:50.008 --> 00:53.958
five, 10. There's a couple pennies.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.800
It's currency, ain't it?

01:02.562 --> 01:03.558
What?

01:03.689 --> 01:05.562
Dewey Crowe.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.399
How are you doing this fine afternoon?

01:07.526 --> 01:09.851
I'm good, Ellen May. And you?

01:10.279 --> 01:13.066
I don't know. You tell me.

01:14.366 --> 01:18.529
Yeah, I'm afraid I got nothing for you
right at this second,

01:18.662 --> 01:21.034
but I'll be back real soon,
and I'm gonna be flush.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.580
You ever get it together,
you know where to find me.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.043
I'd be more than happy
to contribute to the cause, if you'd like.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.173
I don't need your charity, Boyd.
I got things lined up.

01:34.011 --> 01:37.296
Whatever puts a smile on your face,
Dewey Crowe.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.883
You know, Boyd,

01:42.019 --> 01:44.592
for a guy who's supposedly changed,

01:45.522 --> 01:48.476
you sound an awful lot
like you always did.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.451
What are we doing, Winona?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.875
- What are we...
- What are we doing?

02:10.005 --> 02:11.250
We're having some beers,

02:11.381 --> 02:13.457
and we're waiting for Dave Alvin
to come on the stage.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.083
At a roadhouse
50 miles outside of Lexington?

02:17.012 --> 02:18.340
Was he playing
somewhere else tonight?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.464
- No, that's not my point.
- What is your point?

02:20.599 --> 02:24.015
If he was playing in Lexington,
would we go see him?

02:24.436 --> 02:25.432
No.

02:25.562 --> 02:29.642
No, 'cause we drive to the middle of nowhere
anytime we want to be seen in public.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.317
We lie to everyone we know.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.276
I thought we were being discreet.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.859
Which I understood
when Gary didn't know about us.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.734
Well, just because Gary knows about us

02:37.866 --> 02:39.444
doesn't mean the whole
world needs to know about us.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.660
- I don't see why.
- 'Cause I'm still married, Raylan.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.783
What if you weren't?

02:43.914 --> 02:46.452
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Dave Alvin.</i>

02:46.583 --> 02:49.156
Well, that's a longer conversation.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.463
<i>Hey, how y'all doing tonight?</i>

03:02.766 --> 03:04.924
Are you not divorcing Gary?

03:06.436 --> 03:08.014
- Can we talk about this some...
- Because if you aren't,

03:08.146 --> 03:09.522
then I really don't know
what the hell we're doing.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.768
All right, maybe I wouldn't be so hesitant
to tell the world and divorce Gary

03:12.901 --> 03:15.439
if I thought you and I
could be actually happy together.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.818
I can't believe you said that.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.117
I'm sorry. It's just...

03:23.245 --> 03:26.530
I wanted tonight to be fun.
This was supposed to be fun.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.408
- Tim's here.
- What?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.459
Tim, your fellow marshal.
He's at the bar.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.007
- Let's invite him over.
- We should take off.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.969
- Are you serious?
- You cannot be serious.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.961
Did you hear a word I just said?

03:43.098 --> 03:45.553
You said you wanted to have fun.
Let's have fun.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.641
Come on. Dave Alvin.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.606
Either give me your
keys or come with me.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.396
Okay.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.660
What are we stopping for?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.249
Bridge is out.
What do you want me to do?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.866
- Get back to your seat.
- Oh, come on, Bobby. I got to drain it.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.711
- Hold it.
- I been holding it!

04:56.838 --> 04:58.712
You piss out the window if you want,

04:58.840 --> 05:00.833
but you ain't getting off this bus.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.509
- You want me to back it up?
- Move on.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.750
Shit!

05:30.205 --> 05:32.660
You all stay down and quiet!

05:38.964 --> 05:39.995
Pick him up.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.918
Man, I got a bad back.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.884
Lift with your legs.

05:54.938 --> 05:59.564
You want to grab the junk, or were you
thinking we'd stay a little while?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.651
Looks like Christmas come early.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.741
I don't want to be hearing about this!

06:48.700 --> 06:50.574
Well, I thought you both
might want to know,

06:50.702 --> 06:54.367
AUSA has determined that
the shooting of Jess Timmons was good.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.612
No surprise there.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.492
Hell of a shot.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.745
Did you consider what might
have happened if you'd missed?

07:00.879 --> 07:02.706
I can't carry a tune.

07:03.381 --> 07:08.257
I don't know how to shoot a basketball,
and my handwriting is barely legible.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.667
But I don't miss.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.006
All right, that'll do it.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.517
Raylan?

07:19.648 --> 07:21.687
Stay a minute, would you?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.073
Do I need to be concerned?

07:30.492 --> 07:31.523
About what?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.113
Oh, shit. He saw us?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.622
Listen. It's not what it looked like.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.706
It was just two people having
some beers, seeing some music.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.665
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.714
Raylan, what are you talking about?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.712
What are you talking about?

07:51.846 --> 07:54.219
I'm asking
if I need to be concerned about Tim,

07:55.308 --> 07:58.891
'cause he just shot a man,
and you've shot men.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.389
And he's a little off.
And you're always a little off.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.397
And so I'm just asking.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.313
If there's something eating at him,
I haven't noticed.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.477
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.321
You're not getting off the hook
that easy, though.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.782
Two people, out having beers,
seeing music.

08:13.910 --> 08:14.906
Let's just forget it.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.037
So, you were out with somebody,
and Tim happened to be there.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.493
Could we not? Just...

08:19.791 --> 08:22.199
Suppose it could be Rachel.
Are you sleeping with Rachel?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.498
No.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.831
I don't guess Ava's
looking to spend time with you.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.882
- And I think I would remember if it was me.
- You done?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.086
Unless, of course, you roofied me.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.216
Did you roofie me, Raylan?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.672
- Goodbye, Art.
- Wait. Wait.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.513
I've got one more thing to talk
to you about. Walk with me.

08:41.645 --> 08:45.097
I got a call this morning from a
trooper down in Harlan, Tom Bergen.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.356
Yeah. Helped us out
with that Jimmy Earl Dean deal.

08:47.485 --> 08:51.898
One of his troopers found an abandoned
church bus out on Glen Hollow Road,

08:52.031 --> 08:53.739
and the sole remaining survivor

08:54.284 --> 08:57.320
had a hole in his head
the size of a .38-calibre bullet.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.245
See, now that's why
I don't go to church.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.579
Well, you should start,
but not with this one,

09:01.791 --> 09:03.535
'cause apparently it doesn't exist.

09:03.668 --> 09:04.997
Bus was stolen,

09:05.128 --> 09:09.173
and they found a receipt on the floor from a
convenience store in Jacksonville, Florida.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.837
- Oxy run?
- Probably the return leg.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.629
- Then it was hit by another set of criminals.
- Shit.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.843
You think it was him?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.429
I don't know. What do you think?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.101
You told me he was playing it straight.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.599
Well, wouldn't be the first time
he said one thing and did another.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.019
- I'll give you a call when I get down to Harlan.
- All right.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.983
Holy shit. Wait a minute.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.488
I got it.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.609
Winona.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.776
You were out with Winona.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.487
Oh, shit. And I thought
sleeping with a witness was stupid.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.540
Hey. No, no, no. Hey. It ain't like that.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.957
I really would like to
know what it is like.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.252
And I'd love to tell you, but right now
my presence is needed in Harlan.

09:51.382 --> 09:55.131
You're a thrill a minute, Raylan.
We need to sell tickets.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.561
I ask you something, Crowder?

10:16.074 --> 10:18.150
How'd you manage to get this job, huh?

10:18.910 --> 10:22.113
I heard about you,
some of the things you done.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.700
This ain't the most
reputable operation in the world,

10:26.835 --> 10:30.535
but seems to me they could have done
better than hiring a murdering ex-con.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.917
Maybe you should ask the people
who hired me.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.340
- I'd rather ask you.
- Hey, Pruitt.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.797
You ain't got no cause for that.
Leave him alone.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.929
Spend all that time down below,

10:45.061 --> 10:48.430
looking out for people,
just to come up and start brawling.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.269
I'm Kyle. So you're Boyd Crowder, huh?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.890
Yeah, that's right.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.649
I been here a couple days. How
about you? How long you been here?

10:55.780 --> 10:56.978
Not long this go-round.

10:57.115 --> 11:02.192
Hey, say, you know where a fella
can get a drink in a dry county?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.906
There's a bar in a puddle
out by Cumberland.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.293
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm buying if you care to join.

11:10.712 --> 11:14.709
No offense, Kyle, but I
prefer to drink alone.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.509
None taken.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.719
Maybe next time.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.424
Gonna be a tough hog to tie.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.141
Now, the way I figure
it, we got two tracks.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.941
One is, who was running this Oxy bus?

11:32.066 --> 11:34.225
The other one's, who set out to rob it?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.855
I figure you're right.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.026
And that fella that got shot.
Bobby Lawton?

11:38.573 --> 11:41.693
- He's Frankfort, born and raised.
- Dixie Mafia?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.324
You got any experience
with that bunch?

11:44.454 --> 11:45.912
Little bit.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.041
Good day, gentlemen.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.666
- Doyle.
- Chief.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.424
Quite a mess we got here.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.125
It'll do.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.595
I know you two don't hold the
local P.D. In the highest regard,

12:05.725 --> 12:08.679
and I can't say as I blame you
after what's transpired down here,

12:08.811 --> 12:11.978
but the last thing we want
is criminals stealing from criminals,

12:12.106 --> 12:14.894
people shooting at each other
out of pickup trucks.

12:15.026 --> 12:19.569
So, you all find anything or
need a hand, y'all let me know.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.032
You gonna talk to Boyd
Crowder about this?

12:23.159 --> 12:26.362
It seems like it's in his wheelhouse,
as they say.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.954
That it does.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.242
Are you aware of his
current living situation?

12:32.377 --> 12:35.580
Well, you can find him shacked up
over at Ava's.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.932
Dewey Crowe.

12:51.062 --> 12:54.513
You come to regale me with stories
of your Floridian adventures.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.855
Surprised you got the nerve
to ask me that, Boyd.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.728
I'm sorry. Did you find that offensive?

12:58.861 --> 13:01.150
God damn it, don't play with me.
I know it was you.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.985
- What was me?
- I saw Cutter, Boyd.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.279
I know you tipped him off.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.364
I was gonna make $200 from that trip.
Now I got nothing.

13:08.705 --> 13:12.239
Wait a second. You're talking about
Cutter from the Commando days?

13:12.375 --> 13:14.414
How many Cutters you know?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.335
And what was it you
think I had him do?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.455
Rob the damn bus! What do you think?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.251
Well, this figures.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.090
Hey, Ava.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.424
You got two minutes
to get him out of here.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.047
Bye, Ava.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.558
She looks as good as ever, huh?

13:36.441 --> 13:39.691
Are you telling me
that the reason why you're here

13:40.319 --> 13:42.727
is that Cutter robbed your Oxy bus,
and you think I'm responsible?

13:42.864 --> 13:46.197
I don't care that you robbed it,
Boyd, but I need that money.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.402
These here are rock-hard times
for Dewey Crowe.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.864
I had no hand in it.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.368
Well, why should I believe that?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.207
All right.

13:59.881 --> 14:03.878
If you didn't have a hand in it,
then I'll assume you won't mind

14:04.010 --> 14:06.465
if I make a play for it myself.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.265
What are you thinking?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.182
- Don't.
- Don't what?

14:11.309 --> 14:13.800
Don't go to Amber Holler
and try to rob some robbers.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.391
I wasn't gonna do that.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.439
They probably already unloaded
it by now, and if they haven't,

14:18.566 --> 14:21.022
they're gonna be on edge,
high on their own stash.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.860
Now, you don't want to walk into that.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.858
Spoken like a man
protecting his associates.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.779
Spoken like a man who doesn't
want to see you get killed.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.487
Hey! Look.

14:32.622 --> 14:36.916
Whoever Cutter took those pills from
is gonna want them back.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.495
Now, you take them from Cutter,

14:39.629 --> 14:43.413
you're gonna have two sets of angry killers
looking high and low for you and that Oxy.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.876
I know you think I'm stupid, Boyd,

14:50.765 --> 14:52.307
but I ain't.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.976
I'm gonna get what's mine,

14:55.103 --> 14:57.854
and you'd be best not to get in my way.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.695
I'm gonna ask you one more time, son.

15:06.823 --> 15:07.854
Don't do it.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.812
Hello, Ava.

15:39.522 --> 15:43.140
Sorry just to stop by like this,
but I need a minute.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.556
Okay.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.852
What can I do for you, Raylan?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.398
Actually, I'm here for Boyd.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.198
You see his truck?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.781
I'm not familiar with his truck.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.080
Tell the truth.
You come to my door to talk to Boyd

15:58.583 --> 16:01.500
or to ask me why he's
living in my house?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.372
I'm here on business, Ava.

16:06.799 --> 16:11.212
Raylan, Bowman didn't leave me
with much more than shitty memories

16:11.345 --> 16:15.343
and a balloon payment
on a mortgage that I can't afford.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.226
Now, I work at the beauty
parlour in Corbin,

16:18.352 --> 16:19.895
but it ain't hardly enough.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.227
And Boyd? He helps out.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.642
I know it's odd.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.393
But do you realise
he's the only kin I have left?

16:27.528 --> 16:29.936
It sounds mutually beneficial.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.651
- Has he left for work?
- We have an arrangement.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.821
No liquor in the house.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.240
I was drinking way too much.
Maybe you noticed.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.532
And, no trouble with the law.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.454
He does anything I find the least bit
offensive, I throw him out.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.707
- It's really pretty simple.
- Ava, why I'm here,

16:48.841 --> 16:50.750
I'm looking into the possibility

16:50.885 --> 16:54.503
that he had a hand in hijacking
an Oxy bus, shooting a guard.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.184
There are these pill mills in Florida
that don't computerise records.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.517
Dixie Mafia's been hiring busload of
folks to go down to Broward County...

17:01.646 --> 17:05.097
Yeah, I know what an Oxy bus is.
I read the papers.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.642
You think Boyd hijacked one?

17:08.944 --> 17:11.648
I wouldn't be standing here otherwise.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.203
Guess that explains Dewey being here.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.571
Dewey Crowe? He was here?

17:22.541 --> 17:26.124
He and Boyd were arguing about something.
I didn't pay much attention to what.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.211
Guess maybe I should have.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.421
Ava.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.304
Anything you can tell
me would be helpful.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.135
Boyd already left for his night shift.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.726
But he doesn't go straight to the mine.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.932
He stops at Audry's first.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.602
I'm sure you know where that is.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.655
You probably lost your virginity there.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.326
Good luck!

18:07.962 --> 18:10.120
Sorry, son. We close early on Tuesdays.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.173
Yeah, I just need me a ski mask.
It won't take but a second.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.377
- A ski mask?
- That's right.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.881
Son, this is Kentucky.
What do you need a ski mask for?

18:20.016 --> 18:21.889
Who are you, ski-mask police?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.132
You got one or not?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.096
I don't have ski masks.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.183
Maybe you should try the surplus store
down the street.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.107
They're the ones who sent me here.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.559
- There's always eBay.
- E-what?

18:32.862 --> 18:35.779
It don't have to be a ski mask.
You got a catcher's mask

18:35.906 --> 18:40.200
or one of them hockey goalie masks,
like they wear in that slasher movie?

18:40.328 --> 18:44.491
You want I should call the police
right now and save you the trouble?

18:44.623 --> 18:46.996
Well, I thought this was America.

18:47.126 --> 18:51.171
Are you telling me a man can't
buy a mask in America no more?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.789
You're welcome to buy anything
you see here, son.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.922
But you do it now, because I'm fixing
to lock that door in two minutes.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.787
Back in Audry's.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.783
Feel like I'm 13 again.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.461
Late bloomer, huh?

19:31.587 --> 19:35.751
Is it just me, or has the presence of a
US Marshal made these folks uneasy?

19:35.883 --> 19:38.291
Well, maybe it's just your hat.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.843
I don't suppose you being here
is a coincidence.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.465
Hey, where's Dewey? Is he here, too?

19:44.600 --> 19:47.352
Well, why would I
know where Dewey is?

19:48.187 --> 19:51.437
Well, I heard you guys have been
hanging out again.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.309
Ava told you that?

19:55.653 --> 20:00.315
I got to admit, it took me by surprise,
you and her shacking up.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.860
Well, it's not what you think.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.902
She told me if you looked at her funny,
she'd kick you out.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.317
Well, maybe it is what you think.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.948
Your reason for being here would be?

20:07.081 --> 20:10.829
Is to ask you if you had anything to do

20:10.960 --> 20:14.792
with that Oxy bus getting jacked
out on Glen Hollow Road.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.507
Now, why, considering the context
of our last conversation,

20:20.636 --> 20:22.095
would you come here
and ask me about that?

20:22.221 --> 20:26.135
I thought I made myself fairly clear
about my intentions.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.425
Simple question. Yes or no.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.055
True, but the real question is

20:30.187 --> 20:32.595
whether or not you
will believe my answer.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.563
Well, hell, give it a shot. We'll see.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.908
No, Raylan.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.609
I had nothing to do
with that bus being robbed.

20:48.789 --> 20:49.952
Okay.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.588
I don't suppose you know who did.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.217
If I did know, would I be
obligated to share it with you?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.840
That's up to you.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.475
How much blood do you want
on your hands?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.763
How much did you enjoy prison?

21:29.038 --> 21:30.662
Federal marshal!

21:30.790 --> 21:33.909
Show me those hands
and get on the goddamn ground!

21:35.628 --> 21:36.659
Oh, my God!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.622
Get down! Hands behind your heads!

21:39.006 --> 21:42.090
I will put a hole through
you if you make me.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.510
You boys think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.805
Well, if you was, I
wouldn't be standing here.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.717
You gonna tell me
where the rest of them pills is at,

21:53.854 --> 21:55.396
or are you gonna keep being smart?

21:55.523 --> 21:56.721
What pills?

21:57.441 --> 21:59.350
Outlaw life's hard, ain't it?

21:59.860 --> 22:00.891
Now, you gonna tell me,

22:01.028 --> 22:03.317
or I'm gonna start putting bullets
in places that bleed.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.443
You can't do that.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.610
Hell, I can't!
I'm Federal Marshal Raylan Givens!

22:07.743 --> 22:09.901
Don't nobody mess with me
'round these parts.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.697
Now, where's them pills at?

22:13.082 --> 22:15.787
All right! Okay, the microwave.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.998
Either of you move,
it'll be the last mistake you ever make.

22:27.513 --> 22:30.633
You have any idea
who you're messing with, asshole?

22:31.892 --> 22:33.173
Well, let me see.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.766
Is he a federal marshal, like I am?

22:35.896 --> 22:37.972
Then I don't give a shit!

22:39.400 --> 22:41.191
We'll see you again.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.274
Yeah, well, don't you forget.
It's Raylan Givens.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.947
Come looking for me. You hear?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.537
If I was you boys,
I'd give up this Oxy bullshit.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.416
Go back to poaching gators. It's safer.

23:07.928 --> 23:11.214
Your CI saw this guy come in
and rob these boys of their pills.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.890
That's right.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.636
- Well, she get a good look at him?
- Yeah, she did.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.560
Well?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.691
Raylan, you and I go back a long way.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.108
We grew up around here together.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.108
Our families have both had
their issues with the law.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.241
And despite that criminal element,
both of us became lawmen.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.990
I'm sorry. What are we talking about?

23:34.121 --> 23:38.664
I got to thinking, "Maybe Raylan isn't
the man I always thought he was.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.580
"Hell, maybe Raylan ain't the man
everybody thinks he is."

23:41.712 --> 23:43.586
Was that supposed to be an answer?

23:45.007 --> 23:47.462
Sometimes a man does a thing,

23:47.593 --> 23:52.089
and certain folks, they might see
that thing as something wrong.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.049
Others, they might embrace that.

23:54.391 --> 23:58.259
Hell, I mean, they might even be
in a position to help that man out,

23:58.395 --> 24:02.144
providing that favour
gets returned later on.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.609
Are you speaking Martian, Doyle,
'cause I swear I don't...

24:06.737 --> 24:08.528
I know you took them pills, Raylan.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.316
I did what, now?

24:10.449 --> 24:11.943
The CI in there?

24:12.576 --> 24:14.035
She seen the whole thing.

24:14.161 --> 24:18.075
She said Marshal Raylan Givens
busted in there, hat and all,

24:18.207 --> 24:20.662
and stole them pills at gunpoint.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.373
- Well, then, I guess you got me, Doyle.
- I do.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.463
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

24:29.968 --> 24:31.427
Am I the man you saw?

24:32.179 --> 24:34.670
- Man I saw what?
- Who robbed Elrod and Cutter.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.264
- Lord, no.
- Well, you said...

24:40.938 --> 24:42.100
And you believed her?

24:42.398 --> 24:44.805
I don't know you, Raylan!

24:44.942 --> 24:47.515
I mean, you think
there ain't never been a dirty marshal?

24:47.653 --> 24:49.895
- What was that shit you were saying?
- What shit?

24:50.030 --> 24:52.604
About "You think you know a man,
but don't"?

24:53.867 --> 24:56.987
I was just feeling you out, pal,
just making sure.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.365
Is that what that was?

24:59.498 --> 25:03.626
Like the way one drug user tries to see
if a man he just met is carrying?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.544
Something like that?

25:07.047 --> 25:08.921
That's how you see it?

25:11.218 --> 25:13.341
This man you saw. Describe him to me.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.756
Oh, well, he was smaller,

25:17.391 --> 25:18.885
kind of scrawny.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.687
He had a neck tattoo
peeking up out of his shirt.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.387
- What'd it look like?
- I couldn't really make it out.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.516
- It was just some letters going across.
- Okay.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.690
I ain't ever seen a lawman
with a tattoo on his neck.

25:28.819 --> 25:29.934
Anything else?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.271
He was making some
strange comments,

25:32.406 --> 25:34.778
one at the end about poaching gators.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.071
Poaching gators?

25:36.201 --> 25:39.950
Yeah, I remember it
'cause it didn't make no sense at all.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.166
Put an APB out
on a man named Dewey Crowe.

25:45.919 --> 25:49.703
It was a thing of beauty.
They never even knew what hit them!

25:49.840 --> 25:51.998
Ellen May! Ellen... Ellen May.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.051
Okay, now,
why don't you grab a friend?

25:55.179 --> 25:57.634
Let's go out back, and we're
gonna have us some fun, okay?

25:57.765 --> 25:59.923
- You for real?
- I'm for real.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.517
Take a little peek at that.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.351
- What do you think of that?
- I love it.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.436
You want light or dark?

26:07.441 --> 26:08.852
Hair, Dewey.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.854
I'm good either way.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.190
I ain't fussy!

26:26.418 --> 26:28.707
Don't you want to
hear what happened?

26:29.880 --> 26:30.911
Not particularly.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.171
It was a thing of beauty!

26:33.300 --> 26:35.209
They never even saw it coming.

26:35.344 --> 26:38.464
And you'll never believe
who I told them I was.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.011
Raylan Givens.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.562
Hey! I need a bourbon.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.689
I need a double bourbon.
I need one for my friend.

26:49.817 --> 26:50.812
I'm fine.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.434
Well, ain't you gonna
celebrate with me?

26:53.570 --> 26:54.946
I got to go to work.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.148
What's got you so jammed up?

26:59.159 --> 27:01.401
You know what, Dewey?

27:01.537 --> 27:04.870
If you had any smarts
in that head of yours,

27:04.998 --> 27:08.663
you would get in your car right now,
and you'd start driving,

27:08.794 --> 27:12.245
and you wouldn't stop
until you saw the Everglades.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.216
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.094
I know that if you stay here,

27:18.220 --> 27:20.296
you're not long for this Earth, son.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.676
You know what I think?
I think that you're just mad

27:27.813 --> 27:32.356
because I had the stones to do this,
and you didn't.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.524
You can think what you want.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.278
Just do it from your car.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.277
I will leave here when
I'm good and ready,

27:40.409 --> 27:44.109
and ain't you or no one else
gonna tell me no different.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.873
You chose your path.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.413
Good luck to you, son.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.416
Here's my girls!

27:59.553 --> 28:02.720
- You ready to have a good time?
- You bet you! Let's go!

28:07.144 --> 28:08.223
Givens.

28:08.353 --> 28:12.517
Raylan, I was wondering if back
when we were digging coal together

28:13.317 --> 28:16.234
that you had an inkling of the man
that I might someday become?

28:16.612 --> 28:19.103
You mean just 40 and still single?

28:20.490 --> 28:24.405
Well, I never thought that I would
make a phone call like this, Raylan.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.870
Well, if it's about Dewey,
don't worry about it.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.539
<i>I already know.</i>

28:30.208 --> 28:32.118
Well, he's at Audry's,

28:32.252 --> 28:35.917
handing out OxyContin
like he's a pharmaceutical rep.

28:38.258 --> 28:41.592
That is just about the best thing
I ever laid eyes on.

28:42.596 --> 28:45.716
I always knew you'd be a good time,
Deputy Dewey.

28:45.849 --> 28:46.845
That's right.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.098
Gonna be good times from here on in!

28:50.020 --> 28:51.479
Hey, why don't you
two kiss a little more

28:51.605 --> 28:52.980
- so's I can watch?
- Okay!

29:10.290 --> 29:12.117
Hey, this is quite a party.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.705
You mind if I come in?

29:13.835 --> 29:16.208
Hell, yeah, we do!
This here's a private party.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.838
- Ladies.
- Hi.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.456
I'm Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.499
Another one.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.344
No, not another one.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.178
I'm actually a real US Marshal.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.101
- I want you both to go put your clothes on.
- Okay.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.639
No! No, wait! Wait, wait, wait.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.262
Raylan, please, I'm begging you.
Just give me five more minutes.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.809
I will do whatever you want.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.066
- Seriously?
- Whatever you want.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.566
Yeah, whatever you want, baby.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.651
Thank you.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.063
But I need you to get dressed.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.612
Get dressed.

29:51.081 --> 29:55.707
Well, I always figured you for a
special kind of idiot, Dewey Crowe,

29:56.169 --> 29:59.336
but what you have done
in the past 12 hours

29:59.464 --> 30:04.173
is light-years beyond any stupidity
even I thought you were capable of.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.049
I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.015
Well, I'm talking about
the pills in your car.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.227
Oh, those? Those are for you!

30:13.603 --> 30:16.355
You deputized me, remember?
I was just seizing them for you.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.186
That's good. I'm impressed.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.694
And I assume you were gonna tell me
just as soon as you finished up here.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.196
- Is that it?
- That's right.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.653
So who tipped you off?
Were you on the bus? Who hired you?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.869
I'm sorry, Dewey.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.536
Are you worried about looking like
less than a man,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.909
'cause I believe that
ship has already sailed.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.499
Bobby Lawton. He got killed.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.799
You talk to anyone above him?

30:51.099 --> 30:54.967
Whoa, fellas?
Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens!

30:55.979 --> 30:58.684
I'm gonna need you to stop right there.
Just keep your hands where I can see them.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.440
Ain't falling for that shit again.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.710
Hey!

31:25.842 --> 31:29.009
You gonna stop shooting for a minute
and let me get a word in?

31:29.805 --> 31:31.133
All right.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.891
Well, the good news is,

31:35.894 --> 31:38.385
you seem to be in the right place.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.856
The drugs you stole and the man
who stole them from you are here.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.398
The bad news? So am I.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.184
Let's kill him.

31:46.321 --> 31:49.073
- Here's the deal.
- Either of you move, I'll kill you.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.327
Tell me who hired you to hit that bus.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.949
It was your brother Dickie.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.336
Clear!

32:12.472 --> 32:14.880
Must have thought I was kidding.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.511
Told them to drop their guns.

32:19.646 --> 32:20.642
Let's go.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.606
Do you understand what I'm...

32:23.733 --> 32:25.975
You do not understand what I'm saying.

32:26.111 --> 32:30.572
I'm saying all that smoking, and you
just can't help yourself, can you?

32:31.449 --> 32:33.987
- You can't do it.
- I'm under a lot of stress.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.494
You ain't?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.864
- Who is it?
- Stress.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.120
It's Cutter. It's Cutter.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.079
Where's our pills?

32:44.212 --> 32:45.623
Hang on.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.627
- Where the hell is you?
- Yeah!

32:51.761 --> 32:52.841
Yeah! Yeah!

32:52.971 --> 32:56.755
<i>Is this the dumbest piece of cat
shit on the face of the Earth?</i>

32:56.892 --> 32:57.923
<i>Is it?</i>

32:58.059 --> 32:59.719
What's he saying?

32:59.853 --> 33:03.933
Oh, now. Now, now. And just
who the hell might this be, huh?

33:04.065 --> 33:07.185
It might be the guy who
just saved your ass!

33:07.319 --> 33:09.311
- Jesus Christ!
- Outside, both of you.

33:09.446 --> 33:10.442
- Why?
- Why?

33:10.572 --> 33:13.277
'Cause it smells like pot
and piss in here. Outside.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.277
I ain't got all night!

33:17.829 --> 33:20.071
Against the wall. Let's go!

33:22.167 --> 33:23.542
- What is your problem?
- How's that?

33:23.668 --> 33:25.163
What's my problem?

33:25.295 --> 33:28.628
I just find out you two are responsible
for hijacking a shipment of Oxy,

33:28.757 --> 33:31.592
and I got to kill two morons
to keep your asses out of jail.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.383
Cutter and Elrod told me it was you
right before I killed them.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.757
Ain't they told anyone else
besides you it was us?

33:41.895 --> 33:43.519
Well, I don't know, Coover.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.482
I didn't conduct a full-tilt interrogation.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.102
Did you get the Oxy?

33:48.235 --> 33:51.650
Do you know who that bus belonged to?
Either of you?

33:56.868 --> 33:57.983
Dick?

33:58.370 --> 34:00.030
- The boys up in Frankfort.
- That's right.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.950
Now, you really want to stir up
that hornet's nest, huh?

34:03.083 --> 34:04.363
I ain't afraid of Frankfort.

34:04.501 --> 34:07.122
- You ain't afraid of Frankfort.
- I am not afraid of Frankfort.

34:07.254 --> 34:09.542
Well, what about if Mama found out?
You afraid of Mama?

34:10.632 --> 34:13.170
Yeah, well, that is why
I used Elrod and Cutter.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.092
The Dixie Mafia is gonna be
sniffing around down here,

34:15.219 --> 34:18.221
wondering if Cutter and Elrod
worked for anyone.

34:18.348 --> 34:21.882
Is there anything that can come
back to you besides that cell phone?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.507
Anything?

34:24.228 --> 34:25.225
No.

34:25.563 --> 34:26.559
Dick?

34:28.565 --> 34:29.598
No.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.899
Either one of you two knuckleheads
have any more bright ideas,

34:35.782 --> 34:37.360
you come to me first.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.246
Twice in one day. I am a lucky girl.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.759
Assuming you're still looking for Boyd?

34:56.886 --> 34:58.630
No, I found him.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.174
You throw him in jail?

35:00.307 --> 35:04.387
I assume he's down in the mine,
working his shift, as per usual.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.347
So he didn't rob that bus after all, huh?

35:07.772 --> 35:08.804
Guess not.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.767
You come here just to tell me that?

35:11.359 --> 35:12.735
Well, considering your arrangement,

35:12.861 --> 35:15.268
I wouldn't want you to throw him out
'cause of something I said.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.029
- Very thoughtful of you.
- I want you to throw him out

35:17.157 --> 35:19.612
- because he's Boyd Crowder.
- Really?

35:21.578 --> 35:22.692
I understand, Ava.

35:22.829 --> 35:26.115
He says he wants to change,
and I might buy that he wants to.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.875
But you don't think he will.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.411
Believing that kind of shit
could get me killed.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.004
And I think the same goes for you.

35:33.715 --> 35:34.878
You trying to get back at me?

35:35.008 --> 35:36.039
Because if that's the case,

35:36.176 --> 35:38.049
there's other ways to do it
than moving Boyd in.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.965
Whoa. This isn't about you,

35:41.097 --> 35:43.968
and it is mighty arrogant of you
to think otherwise.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.642
Well, then why?

35:45.769 --> 35:49.268
Why invite even the possibility of the
trouble he brings into your home?

35:49.397 --> 35:51.520
- I told you.
- Oh, that's right.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.642
You need to pay your
rent, and he's your kin.

35:53.777 --> 35:57.561
Well, you can call me arrogant if
you want, but I don't buy that shit.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.188
- Then why?
- I don't know, Ava.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.863
No. You tell me, oh, wise one, why,

36:02.994 --> 36:06.244
who cheated on me with his ex,
who's married?

36:08.458 --> 36:09.537
Ava...

36:10.043 --> 36:13.210
Would you like to come inside
and talk about this?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.377
I don't think that's a good idea.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.047
Then go.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.385
You are choosing not to
be a part of my life.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.350
So you don't get a say in how I live it.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.184
And Boyd? He's staying here.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.480
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.721
Yeah.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.896
You know, and I'd appreciate, the
next time a bus gets robbed in Harlan

36:38.029 --> 36:41.149
that you wouldn't come
knocking on this door.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.830
Bourbon, please.

36:57.590 --> 37:01.125
What does a man have to do
to get a quiet drink in these parts?

37:02.011 --> 37:03.969
Well, what do you know?

37:07.058 --> 37:09.845
Boyd Crowder. Fancy that.

37:12.105 --> 37:14.560
Sorry. What's your name?

37:15.483 --> 37:16.859
Kyle.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.021
I thought I stated it rather politely
the other day.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.147
I prefer to drink alone.

37:23.324 --> 37:26.278
Well, you did. You did,
and I respect that.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.245
I do. But...

37:29.539 --> 37:33.537
Well, truth is,
I came here to offer you something.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.495
I should have come clean at the mine.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.500
I know who you are, Boyd Crowder,

37:39.632 --> 37:43.844
and I'm a great admirer
of all that you've done.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.426
I mean, Crowder's Commandos? Shit!

37:47.140 --> 37:50.057
Brother, you're a local legend.

37:50.185 --> 37:54.052
You was popping off them Jews
like you was in a video game.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.437
I never killed any Jews, Kyle.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.527
In fact, I don't think
I've ever met a Jew in my life.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.988
All I'm saying is that
I understand who you are.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.073
You had a vision. And I have a vision.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.821
You and me, we's the same.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.527
You don't know anything about me

38:11.664 --> 38:14.701
or why I have done the things
that I have done in my life.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.959
Well, now, hold on.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.666
Ain't no reason to get riled up.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.796
I killed people, too.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.677
And I lost friends, like you did,
out in the woods.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.478
But some sacrifices are necessary.

38:35.813 --> 38:39.396
Sometimes people are disposable.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.490
Men like you and me,
we understand that.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.904
Come on, Crowder! Boyd!

38:50.286 --> 38:52.694
Come on. Ain't no need to run off.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.704
Wait a second, will you?

38:54.832 --> 38:56.706
I want to talk to you about something.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.041
Will you just wait a second?

39:00.547 --> 39:03.750
Please wait. Give me two seconds.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.918
Come on. Turn the engine off.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.637
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

39:18.064 --> 39:20.021
Kyle, come on. Let's have a little
conference time, one-on-one,

39:20.149 --> 39:21.312
- me and you. What do you say, huh?
- Please, Boyd!

39:21.442 --> 39:23.269
No, you want to hear...
What do you want to talk about?

39:23.403 --> 39:25.728
Want to talk about my past?

39:25.863 --> 39:27.986
Killing people, blew shit up.
Is that what you want to talk about?

39:28.116 --> 39:30.025
You want to talk about God
and faith and hope?

39:30.159 --> 39:33.493
- My feet are burning! My feet!
- And religion. You want to talk about that?

39:33.621 --> 39:34.819
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.699
We can talk about him, pal.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.039
- You want to meet him? Huh?
- No!

39:39.168 --> 39:41.742
Do you want to meet your maker, Kyle,
'cause I'll be right behind you.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.252
How about we do this on "three"?
Shall we?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.413
- One...
- Stop.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.712
- Two...
- Stop the car!

39:46.843 --> 39:48.123
Three.
