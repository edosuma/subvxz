00:20.088 --> 00:21.822

00:27.828 --> 00:28.829

01:00.894 --> 01:02.863
WASN'T IT JUST THANKSGIVING?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.765
[FINANCIAL ADVISOR]: THE PRICES
ARE ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED

01:04.798 --> 01:06.634
BY THE STRENGTH OF SALES.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.236
50% OF WINTER BUYBACK.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.270
[RADIO HOST]: SO YOU'RE ARGUING

01:09.303 --> 01:10.438
THAT INCREASING
THE VALUE OF SHARES

01:10.471 --> 01:11.739
IS A BAD THING?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.607
[FINANCIAL ADVISOR]: NO, NO,

01:13.641 --> 01:14.608
BUT ISSUING MILLIONS IN BONDS
AND FINANCIAL STOCK BUYBACKS

01:14.642 --> 01:15.209
PUT THE PRESSURE
ON MUTUAL RETURNS

01:15.243 --> 01:16.444
BY MAKING HUGE...

01:18.446 --> 01:19.680
GOOD MORNING, FORBES.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.185
WE NEED TO LOOK AT
YOUR PORTFOLIO.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.853
I THINK IT'S TIME TO DIVERSIFY.

01:25.886 --> 01:26.820
[MEOWS]

01:32.360 --> 01:33.594
THERE YOU GO.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.097
CATNIP IS TRADING UP. WHOO!

01:42.170 --> 01:43.171
ALL RIGHT.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.305
TEXT ME

01:46.174 --> 01:47.608
GOOD MORNING, EVE!

01:47.641 --> 01:49.143
HEY, RUTH.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.811
WOW, THAT IS
SOME SWEATER.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.615
WELL, THANKS!

01:54.648 --> 01:56.717
I CAN PICK YOU UP ONE.
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW LEFT.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.386
THAT'S OKAY.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.553
I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:59.587 --> 02:01.255
A ONE-SWEATER
PER-BUILDING SWEATER.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.694
OH, HE'S LEFT ALREADY
FOR THE HOLIDAYS?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.895
DIVING IN THE CAYMANS? WOW!

02:08.929 --> 02:11.932
WELL, HAVE HIM CALL ME
WHEN HE COMES UP FOR AIR.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.668
YES. EVE MORGAN.
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.904
THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY!

02:18.306 --> 02:19.440

YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.880
OKAY, THANKS.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.282
HEY, JEFF.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.519

02:36.557 --> 02:37.525
HEY, CARTER.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.193
GOOD MORNING, EVE.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.528
COMING TO THE PARTY
TOMORROW?

02:40.561 --> 02:41.829
WHAT PARTY?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.664
THE OFFICE
CHRISTMAS PARTY?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.666
OH, RIGHT.

02:45.699 --> 02:46.867
TELL ME YOU'RE
NOT WORKING.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.436
WELL,
WHILE YOU'RE DRINKING EGGNOG,

02:48.469 --> 02:50.704
I'M GOING
TO BE IMPROVING OUR BOTTOM LINE.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.839
I REMEMBER BEING
LIKE YOU ONCE.

02:51.872 --> 02:52.773
[EVE]:
MM-HMM.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.710
HI, DR. MORGAN.
B ONJOUR !

02:56.744 --> 02:57.978
HOW IS HELEN?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.847
IS SHE STILL RIDING DRESSAGE?

02:59.880 --> 03:02.383
YES, OF COURSE, I REMEMBER.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.420
LOOK, I AM JUST
GOING TO SAY IT, OKAY?

03:06.454 --> 03:08.589
LET THE CHIPS FALL
WHERE THEY MAY.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.759
APEX EAST IS A SOLID FIRM,

03:11.792 --> 03:12.826
BUT WHAT ARE THEY DOING FOR YOU?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.362
3%?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.463
I COULD DOUBLE IT.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.665
DRINKS TONIGHT?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.933
YES! YES! OF COURSE.
TRES BIEN!

03:19.967 --> 03:22.270
I'LL HAVE MY ASSISTANT
SET IT UP.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.771
OKAY. BYE!

03:26.340 --> 03:27.341
[LISA]:
YOU BOUGHT A TREE?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.476
[EVE]: OH, CLIENT GIFT.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.877
WHAT COLOR IS THAT?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.612
CELERY?

03:31.645 --> 03:34.948
WE NEED TO SET UP AND PRINT
A NEW CLIENT SIGNATURE PACK

03:34.982 --> 03:36.617
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO SIGN FONTAINE & FOWLER.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.452
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

03:38.486 --> 03:39.753
I THOUGHT
THEY WERE WITH APEX EAST.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.822
YES, NOT FOR LONG.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.524
AND THAT IS WHY
YOU'RE MY IDOL.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.925
I'M GOING TO SIGN
ONE NEW CLIENT

03:44.958 --> 03:46.294
BEFORE THE NEW YEAR,

03:46.327 --> 03:47.295
AND I'M GOING
TO BEAT OUT CARTER

03:47.328 --> 03:48.562
FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.030
ALL RIGHT.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.334
GO AHEAD, BOOK MY TABLE
AT THE CITY CLUB FOR 6:00.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.668
OH, AND I'VE GOT
A CONFERENCE CALL AT 12:30

03:54.702 --> 03:55.903
WITH GIBSON.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.305
CONFLICT.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.672
YOU HAVE LUNCH
WITH YOUR BROTHER TODAY.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.309
OH...
THAT'S TODAY?

04:01.342 --> 04:02.643
AND YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO LET YOU CANCEL AGAIN

04:02.676 --> 04:04.578
SINCE YOU'VE DONE IT
THREE TIMES ALREADY.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.016
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:09.049 --> 04:10.618
WE'LL BOOK THE CONFERENCE ROOM
FOR NOON,

04:10.651 --> 04:11.919
AND THAT WAY,
I CAN HAVE HALF AN HOUR,

04:11.952 --> 04:12.986
AND I CAN CATCH UP WITH HIM.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.054
OKAY?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.389
OKAY.
THANK YOU!

04:15.423 --> 04:16.757
YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.394
THERE YOU GO, BUD.
MUCH BETTER.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.430
HEY!

04:22.463 --> 04:23.731
THERE SHE IS!

04:23.764 --> 04:24.898
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE BRINGING THE BOYS!

04:24.932 --> 04:26.767
HEY!
WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.402
WE WANTED
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE REAL.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.570
OH.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.771
WHERE WERE YOU
HIDING?

04:30.804 --> 04:31.939
HEY, MANNERS.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.807
OKAY, SO, BIG QUESTION.

04:33.841 --> 04:34.942
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS?

04:34.975 --> 04:35.943
YOU ALREADY
GAVE SOMETHING.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.010
WHAT?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.078
THE COMPANY FRUIT BASKET.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.547
OH.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.015
OKAY, SO, UH...

04:42.049 --> 04:44.685
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT BIKES?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.687
[BOYS, TOGETHER]:
BIKES! THAT'S AWESOME!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.055
EVE, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.923
NO, IT'S FINE!
IT'S FOR CHRISTMAS.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.492
IT ONLY COMES ONCE A YEAR,
THANK GOODNESS.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.560
COME ON.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.694
LOOK, LOOK
WHAT I GOT FOR YOU.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.829
LET'S HAVE SOME COOKIES.
YUM, YUM.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.531
WE'VE GOT MILK.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.333
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE CHANGE IN PLANS,

04:59.367 --> 05:00.568
BUT I HAVE
THIS CONFERENCE CALL,

05:00.601 --> 05:01.835
AND I JUST CAN'T
CHANGE IT.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.070
WELL, AT LEAST TELL ME

05:03.103 --> 05:05.406
YOU'RE STILL COMING
FOR CHRISTMAS.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.808
SHERRY'S MAKING YOUR FAVORITES,
THE SPECIAL GREEN BEANS?

05:07.841 --> 05:08.776
MM...

05:11.445 --> 05:13.947
IT'S OAK PARK.
IT'S A HALF-HOUR CAB RIDE.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.082
BUT I'M JUST SO BUSY.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.784
[SIGHS] EVE...

05:18.051 --> 05:19.019
I'M ABOUT
TO MAKE PARTNER.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.954
I MEAN,
I'M THIS CLOSE!

05:20.988 --> 05:22.656
YOU KNOW,

05:22.690 --> 05:23.924
CRESTLANE JUST HASN'T EVEN
NOMINATED SOMEONE FOR PARTNER

05:23.957 --> 05:24.958
IN 10 YEARS.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.760
THAT'S GREAT, SIS.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.895
BUT...

05:29.597 --> 05:32.600
LOOK, I KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

05:32.633 --> 05:34.968
BUT WE HAD EACH OTHER.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.605
NOW YOU'RE WORKING
ALL THE TIME.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.939
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.141
I'LL GET TO IT.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.943
WHEN?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.612
YOU NEVER SEE YOUR FAMILY.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.779
YOU PUT ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
ON THE BACK BURNER.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.147
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.649
REALLY?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.618
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU LET ANYONE IN?

05:50.651 --> 05:53.787
WELL, ACTUALLY...

05:53.821 --> 05:54.922
I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP NOW.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.558
MM-HMM, YES.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.494
MY RELATIONSHIP IS
A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP

06:00.528 --> 06:02.430
BECAUSE...

06:02.463 --> 06:05.065
MY BOYFRIEND

06:06.467 --> 06:07.901
MM-HMM.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.036
-EVE.
-YEAH?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.037
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.038
YES, DEFINITELY,
BUT FIRST,

06:11.071 --> 06:12.906
GO GET MY NEPHEWS
SOME BIKES.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.976
-EVE.
-GO!

06:16.009 --> 06:17.611
THEY'RE GOING
TO LOVE IT.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.482
-TAXI!
-TAXI!

06:24.785 --> 06:26.587
-OH!
-OH, SORRY.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.821
-SORRY.
-NO, NO, I'M SORRY.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.526
I WAS HERE FIRST.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.762
WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE
WE WERE HERE AT THE SAME TIME.

06:34.795 --> 06:38.499
UM.... ARE YOU
GOING NORTH?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.534
YEAH, NORTHSIDE.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.570
ME TOO.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.538
WANT TO SHARE?

06:44.572 --> 06:45.606
OKAY.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.214
[RADIO]: * ...IN A ONE-HORSE
OPEN SLEIGH *

06:54.247 --> 06:55.182
* O'ER THE FIELD WE GO...

06:55.215 --> 06:56.950
HOW'S YOUR DAY BEEN?

06:56.984 --> 06:59.453
IN THE TRENCHES.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

06:59.487 --> 07:01.555
MAYBE A DIFFERENT
KIND OF TRENCH.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.791
SIR, COULD YOU CHANGE
THIS RADIO STATION?

07:03.824 --> 07:05.559
YOU DON'T LIKE
CHRISTMAS MUSIC?

07:05.593 --> 07:07.528
NO. IT GOES ON
AND ON AND ON.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.596
'TIS THE SEASON.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.765
YEAH, FA-LA-LA-LA-LA.
HO-HO-HO.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.034
* DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW

07:14.067 --> 07:16.203
* IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH

07:18.171 --> 07:20.708
PARTRIDGES IN TREES.
WHAT DO THOSE WORDS EVEN MEAN?

07:20.741 --> 07:24.745
I'M PRETTY SURE
THEY'RE CALLED "LYRICS."

07:24.778 --> 07:27.047
BUT THEY'RE
NON-MIGRATORY BIRDS.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.181
AND IF THEY DID
MAKE A NEST,

07:28.215 --> 07:29.850
IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN A PEAR TREE.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.019
OH, SIR, WE'RE GOING TO NEED
TO TAKE MADISON UP HERE.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.186
[MAN]: NO, PLEASE,
STAY ON STATE.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.055
MADISON WILL GET US
INTO TRAFFIC.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.957
YEAH,
BUT MY STOP IS FIRST.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.626
WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE ME LATE.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.027
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE ME LATE

07:40.060 --> 07:40.994
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.229
LIFE OR DEATH IMPORTANT?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.097
ACTUALLY, YES.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.766
OKAY.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.035
SO TURN RIGHT, SIR.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.240
AAAAAND...

07:53.273 --> 07:55.042
JINGLE ALL THE WAY.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.279
WELL, I'M GOING TO WALK.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.981
HERE, THANK YOU.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.082

08:02.115 --> 08:03.717
GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR GUITAR THING.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.718
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.792
YOU CAN TURN THE MUSIC BACK ON.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.015
-OH, HEY!

SOME EGGNOG.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.020
OH, THANK YOU!

08:41.054 --> 08:42.789
IS THIS POISONED?

08:42.823 --> 08:44.024
A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE

08:44.057 --> 08:45.626
FROM SOMEONE
WHO'S BEEN AT THIS LONGER?

08:46.794 --> 08:49.597
I KNOW HOW BADLY
YOU WANT THIS PARTNERSHIP,

08:49.630 --> 08:51.999
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO GET IT,

08:52.032 --> 08:54.301
BUT SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF
IS PASSING YOU BY.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.270
ARE YOU TRYING
TO PSYCH ME OUT?

08:59.272 --> 09:00.273
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.842
OH, DON'T GIVE UP THAT EASILY!

09:03.176 --> 09:04.812
I'M GOING HOME
TO CHRISTMAS CAROL

09:04.845 --> 09:06.079
WITH MY FAMILY.

HEY, HONEY.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.763
HOW WAS
YOUR LAST DAY OF SCHOOL?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.065
ANDY BARNES ATE
12 CANDY CANES.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.032
THAT'S ALL?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.104
JOE!

10:04.137 --> 10:06.406
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ON A DIET.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.375
THIS IS MY DAY
TO CHEAT.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.243
YOU SAID THAT YESTERDAY.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.045
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO REMEMBER THAT.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.818
[LAUREN]:
UNCLE MAX!

10:17.851 --> 10:19.319
HEY, KIDDO!

10:19.352 --> 10:21.254
DID YOU HAVE A FUN SLEEPOVER
WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.355
YEAH.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.091
YEAH?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.292
HOW ABOUT SCHOOL?
YOU GUYS REHEARSE THAT PLAY?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.326
FORGET ABOUT ME.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.995
HOW WAS YOUR AUDITION?

10:28.028 --> 10:30.330
I, UH...

10:30.363 --> 10:32.165
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE IT.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.333
WAIT, WHY?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.403
TRAFFIC JAM.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.871
SORRY, KIDDO.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.973
NEXT CHRISTMAS, OKAY?

10:40.007 --> 10:42.409
BUT THAT'S 372 DAYS AWAY.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.144
IT'LL GO FAST.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.679
HERE.

10:45.713 --> 10:48.048
WORKING ON OUR FAMOUS
YULETIDE STEW.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.085
NEEDS MORE TURMERIC.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.988
TURMERIC?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.189
ALL RIGHT.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.364
REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND MOM
USED TO SING AT THE HOLIDAYS

11:04.397 --> 11:05.899
AND WRITE THOSE FUNNY SONGS?

11:07.801 --> 11:08.869
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.871
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST START AGAIN?

11:10.904 --> 11:11.939
NOT THAT EASY, KIDDO.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.175
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ME?

11:16.443 --> 11:18.678
OF COURSE NOT.
I LOVE HAVING YOU.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.716
I WAS JUST NEVER ANY GOOD
WITHOUT YOUR MOM.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.785
YOU ARE GOOD.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.123
REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOLD ME

11:30.157 --> 11:32.359
THAT YOU WERE STUCK
ON THOSE LINES IN YOUR PLAY?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.196
I'M STUCK, TOO.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.734
NOW, COME ON.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.203
TURMERIC, OR NOT TURMERIC?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.138
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.208
YOU'RE TRYING TO DISTRACT ME,
AREN'T YOU?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.943
HOW DID YOU GUESS?

12:24.444 --> 12:26.079
UNCLE MAX?

12:26.113 --> 12:28.115
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
A MORNING PERSON,

12:28.148 --> 12:29.850
BUT IS IT OKAY
IF WE GET UP EARLY

12:29.883 --> 12:31.184
AND GO SLEDDING?

12:31.218 --> 12:32.920
WHO SAYS
I'M NOT A MORNING PERSON?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.421
YOU SAID
MUSICIANS WERE NIGHT OWLS.

12:34.454 --> 12:35.488
WELL...

12:35.522 --> 12:39.292
THAT WAS BEFORE YOU MOVED IN.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.427
NOW I NEVER SLEEP
AT ALL.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.867
WHEN GRANDMA AND GRANDPA LEAVE,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.202
ARE YOU GOING TO TEACH ME
TO PLAY GUITAR?

12:51.404 --> 12:53.506
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
AFTER NEW YEAR'S, OKAY?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.410
GOODNIGHT, SWEETIE.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.412
SWEET DREAMS.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.326
DEAR GOD...

13:46.359 --> 13:49.596
IT'S ME, LAUREN.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.632
I THINK
THIS IS TOO BIG FOR SANTA,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.368
SO I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO YOU.

13:55.402 --> 13:59.272
I ONLY WANT ONE THING
FOR CHRISTMAS...

13:59.306 --> 14:01.975
MY UNCLE MAX TO BE HAPPY AGAIN.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.919
YES, I'LL HOLD.
SURE.

14:45.953 --> 14:46.920
ROASTED CHESTNUTS?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.155
OH, NUT ALLERGY!

14:48.188 --> 14:49.089
SANTA HAT?
CHRISTMAS SCARF?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.657
HEY, TED?

14:50.690 --> 14:53.126
IT'S EVE MORGAN
FROM CRESTLANE FINANCIAL.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.995
LOOK, I'M JUST GOING TO COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.529
LET THE CHIPS FALL
WHERE THEY MAY.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.365
I KNOW YOU'RE WITH WESTLANE
TRADE FINANCIAL BROKERAGE,

14:58.398 --> 14:59.432
AND I JUST WANT TO PITCH...

14:59.466 --> 15:00.500
[SCREAMS]

15:15.082 --> 15:17.417
WHAT THE...?

15:18.718 --> 15:21.454
SNOWBALL?

15:21.488 --> 15:23.090
HI...

15:24.291 --> 15:26.459
HEY, KITTY.

15:26.493 --> 15:30.263
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE A CAT
I HAD WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

15:30.297 --> 15:32.065
EXCEPT HE HAD A BLACK TAIL.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.675
HEY...

15:46.079 --> 15:47.314
THERE YOU GO.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.464
[WOMAN]:
MISS MORGAN?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.066
HELLO.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.100
I'M PEARL.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.371
I'M GOING TO BE WITH YOU
DURING THIS TRANSITION.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.042
TRANSITION?

16:15.075 --> 16:18.478
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL THIS IS,

16:18.511 --> 16:20.480
OR WHY I'M HERE,

16:20.513 --> 16:22.615
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.585
IN FACT,
I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER, SO...

16:25.618 --> 16:27.187
HOPEFULLY, YOU BILL INSURANCE.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.189
I HAVE 90-10
GROUP COVERAGE.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.757
WE DON'T TAKE
INSURANCE UP HERE.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.325
OKAY.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.561
THEN I'LL JUST...
I'LL PUT IT ON MY CREDIT CARD.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.665
CREDIT CARDS AREN'T NECESSARY
HERE EITHER.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.799
BUT...
WHERE'S MY BAG?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.168
I MEAN, WHERE
IS MY PHONE?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.669
THEY DON'T MATTER.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.239
DO I HAVE A CONCUSSION?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.576
NO.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.379
BUT... I AM ON SOME KIND
OF MEDICATION, THOUGH, RIGHT?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.447
'CAUSE I THINK
I'M HAVING A REACTION.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.716
EVERYTHING IS WHITE.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.252
YES.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.720
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?
IT'S SO PEACEFUL.

17:00.753 --> 17:01.688
NO! IT'S NOT PEACEFUL!

17:01.721 --> 17:03.156
IT'S CRAZY...

17:04.557 --> 17:06.193
OR I AM.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.431
DID CARTER PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.632
NO.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.134
I MEAN,
THAT IS DEVIOUS.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.537
HE'S GOT
THAT WARM, FRIENDLY SMILE.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.473
WOW, HE MUST REALLY WANT
THE PARTNERSHIP.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.076
YOU KNOW, AS I SEE IT,
I THINK HE'S GOING TO GET IT.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.477
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.282
WHAT?

17:31.484 --> 17:32.719
MISS MORGAN, DO YOU REMEMBER

17:32.752 --> 17:34.854
WHEN YOU TRIPPED
AND YOU FELL ON THE ICE,

17:34.887 --> 17:37.690
AND YOU HIT YOUR HEAD
VERY HARD

17:37.724 --> 17:39.526
WHEN YOU WERE MAKING
THAT COLD CALL?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.394
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW THAT?

17:43.763 --> 17:45.432
MISS MORGAN...

17:47.734 --> 17:50.203
YOU ARE IN HEAVEN.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.738
HEAVEN?

17:54.207 --> 17:55.808
DID YOU SEE THAT?

17:55.842 --> 17:59.312
OH, SNOWBALL DOES THAT
ALL THE TIME UP HERE.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.648
SNOWBALL'S BEEN GONE
FOR A LONG TIME.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.517
TIME CAN BE VERY CONFUSING,

18:04.551 --> 18:06.519
BUT IN TIME,
YOU'LL SETTLE IN.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.492
SO...

18:12.525 --> 18:13.460
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT...

18:15.662 --> 18:16.796
I'M DEAD?

18:18.298 --> 18:20.333
WAIT, I CAN'T BE DEAD YET!

18:20.367 --> 18:21.401
I JUST WASN'T EVEN
FINISHED LIVING.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.669
I BARELY STARTED.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.870
I HAD ALL THESE THINGS
TO DO.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.838
I WAS GOING TO START
MY OWN HEDGE FUND,

18:25.872 --> 18:27.640
AND BUY A COUNTRY HOUSE,
AND GET MARRIED,

18:27.674 --> 18:29.776
AND I NEVER EVEN LET
MYSELF FALL IN LOVE.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.278
JUST, IT CAN'T BE OVER!

18:31.311 --> 18:32.745
OH, NO, NO, NO.
SIT. NO.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.248
DON'T CRY, MISS MORGAN.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.783
WE ARE ANGELS.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.851
ANGELS CAN'T CRY.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.589
ANGELS?

18:47.227 --> 18:49.662
SO THIS IS IT?
THIS IS THE END?

18:49.696 --> 18:52.632
NO, WE LIKE TO THINK OF THIS
AS THE NEW BEGINNING.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.401
WHAT DO WE DO HERE?

18:54.434 --> 18:57.370
WELL, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

18:57.404 --> 18:58.938
WE ANSWER PRAYERS,

18:58.971 --> 19:01.408
AND I'M A GUARDIAN ANGEL,

19:01.441 --> 19:04.177
AND YOU'VE BEEN SELECTED
TO BE A CHRISTMAS ANGEL.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.879
CHRISTMAS?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.181
NOW I KNOW
THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.717
WELL, I AGREE,

19:10.750 --> 19:12.485
IT'S NOT AN OBVIOUS CHOICE,

19:12.519 --> 19:14.587
BUT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE
THIS SEASON.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.189
I BARELY CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.225
WELL, NOW YOU CAN.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.428
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, PEARL,

19:21.461 --> 19:23.396
I JUST DON'T SEE MYSELF
CELEBRATING ANYTHING

19:23.430 --> 19:24.297
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.836
PERHAPS WHEN YOU GO BACK,
IT WILL CHANGE.

19:29.869 --> 19:33.740
YOU'RE BEING SENT DOWN
TO ANSWER A CHRISTMAS WISH.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.375
I GET TO GO BACK?

19:35.408 --> 19:36.776
MM-HMM.
FOR A WEEK.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.512
WHAT HAPPENS IN A WEEK?

19:40.780 --> 19:41.714
CHRISTMAS.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.550
OH!

19:50.757 --> 19:51.724
I'M BACK!

19:51.758 --> 19:52.659
MM-HMM.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.294
NOW, THERE ARE RULES.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.762
RULES?

19:55.795 --> 19:58.865
YES, YOU MUST NOT ATTRACT
ANY ATTENTION TO YOURSELF.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.701
NO ONE CAN KNOW
THAT YOU ARE NOW AN ANGEL.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.470
BUT WHO WOULD BELIEVE THAT
ANYWAY?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.672
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.707
WHY IS EVERYONE
STARING AT US?

20:07.740 --> 20:10.677
BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE ONLY ONE THEY CAN SEE.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.945
OH, SO THEY ALL JUST THINK
I'M TALKING TO MYSELF.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.548
IT'S CHICAGO, DEAR.
EVERYBODY DOES IT...

20:15.582 --> 20:18.651
AND YOU ARE ALLOWED
TO INSPIRE,

20:18.685 --> 20:20.353
BUT NOT TO LEAD...

20:20.387 --> 20:21.854
UH-HUH...

20:21.888 --> 20:24.757
AND THEN YOU MUST DO
ALL OF THIS BY YOURSELF.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.493
YOU MUST FIND YOUR OWN WAY,

20:26.526 --> 20:28.961
AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

20:28.995 --> 20:31.030
ARE YOU TO FORM
ANY ATTACHMENTS

20:31.063 --> 20:32.965
OR RELATIONSHIPS.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.934
WELL, I NEVER FOUND TIME
TO DO THAT ON EARTH.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.669
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO START IN THE AFTERLIFE.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.305
AND...

20:38.338 --> 20:39.972
NO CONTACTING
ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.383
[PEARL]: I HAVE SUCH A FONDNESS
FOR THIS CITY.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.620
I LOVE TO COME BACK
AND CHECK IT OUT WHEN I CAN.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.357
I GREW UP IN WICKER PARK.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.426
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.528
LET'S JUST SAY I'VE BEEN
WEARING WHITE A LONG TIME.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.401
I NEVER NOTICED
ALL THE COLORS,

21:08.435 --> 21:10.803
THE LIGHTS
AND THE SOUNDS.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.472
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.973
YEAH.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.311
MY BROTHER...

21:18.345 --> 21:19.546
I HAVE TO TELL MY BROTHER.

21:19.579 --> 21:20.580
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.781
YES, HE DOES.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.619
YOU HAVE TO FOCUS
ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT NOW.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.987
WE HAVE A LITTLE GIRL

21:28.020 --> 21:30.623
WHO'S EXTREMELY WORRIED
ABOUT HER UNCLE.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.459
HE'S AT A CROSSROADS
IN HIS LIFE,

21:32.492 --> 21:34.694
AND I'M AFRAID
HE'S LOST HIS WAY.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.364
OKAY,
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:37.397 --> 21:38.798
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU'RE GOING TO FIX IT,

21:38.831 --> 21:40.767
BUT YOU REALLY NEED
TO DO IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.734
LET'S GO.

21:52.979 --> 21:53.980
THERE HE IS.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.715
[EVE]: HIM?

21:55.748 --> 21:56.983
YEAH.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.718
BUT I KNOW HIM.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.353
NO, NOT REALLY.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.925
PEARL?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.694
PEARL? PEARL!
PEARL, COME BACK!

22:09.696 --> 22:11.431
YOU LOSE A REINDEER
OR SOMETHING?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.433
UH...

22:13.466 --> 22:14.767
AND... AN ANGEL.

22:14.801 --> 22:17.770
LIKE "HARK THE HERALD
ANGELS SING," ANGEL?

22:18.905 --> 22:21.374
FA-LA-LA-LA-LA,
LA-LA-LA-LA.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.650
SO...

22:30.683 --> 22:31.751
DIDN'T THINK
I'D SEE YOU AGAIN.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.520
ME NEITHER.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.388
MAYBE IT'S FATE.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.390
MAYBE, YEAH.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.891
AT THIS POINT,

22:38.925 --> 22:41.528
I THINK THAT I'D PROBABLY
BELIEVE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.029
WHAT WAS ALL THAT OUTSIDE?

22:45.565 --> 22:47.033
I RECENTLY HIT MY HEAD.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.067
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:50.570 --> 22:51.904
I'M ALIVE FOR NOW.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.542
SO YOU WORK HERE?

22:55.575 --> 22:56.676
YEP.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.879
MANAGER, COOK,
BOUNCER, OWNER.

22:59.912 --> 23:00.880
WHERE'S YOUR GUITAR?

23:02.449 --> 23:03.650
I DON'T NEED THAT
TO FLIP BURGERS.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.486
SO WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.521
UH...

23:08.555 --> 23:10.757
A TRIPLE ESPRESSO,
PLEASE?

23:10.790 --> 23:13.192
HOW ABOUT BLACK COFFEE
WITH UNLIMITED REFILLS?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.561
I'LL TAKE IT.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.633
YOU KNOW HER?

23:20.667 --> 23:21.768
WE MET IN A CAB.

23:21.801 --> 23:22.902
SHE'S PRETTY.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.203
I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE'S ALSO NUTS.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.438
WHO ISN'T?

23:25.472 --> 23:26.706
I'VE GOT MY HANDS FULL, SALLY.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.475
THEY'RE NOT
THAT FULL.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.645
SO, DID YOU MAKE YOUR
APPOINTMENT ON TIME?

23:32.679 --> 23:34.781
NO...

23:34.814 --> 23:36.916
THERE WAS A TRAFFIC JAM
ON MADISON.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.118
I'M SORRY.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.922
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:42.955 --> 23:46.125
I'M JUST GOING TO COME RIGHT OUT
AND SAY IT.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.761
LET THE CHIPS FALL
WHERE THEY MAY.

23:48.795 --> 23:53.766
I CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE
A LOT GOING ON HERE,

23:53.800 --> 23:55.434
BUT IS YOUR BOTTOM LINE
WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE?

23:59.739 --> 24:01.741
IS MY WHAT WHAT?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.009
PRIORITIES.
YOU KNOW?

24:04.511 --> 24:07.580
GUITAR, DINER.
DINER, GUITAR.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.582
STILL NOT FOLLOWING.

24:09.616 --> 24:10.583
I... I...

24:13.920 --> 24:15.454
I FEEL LIKE MAYBE YOU ARE...

24:17.757 --> 24:18.625
AT A CROSSROADS.

24:22.261 --> 24:25.565
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE
THAT HEAD CHECKED.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.633
SALLY, CAN YOU TAKE THIS
FOR ME, PLEASE?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.167
I'VE GOT TO GET LAUREN HOME.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.070
COME ON, KIDDO.
IT'S LATE.

24:31.103 --> 24:34.106
OH, BY THE WAY,
I GOOGLED PARTRIDGES.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.107
THEY DO GO IN TREES.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.677
PEAR TREES?

24:41.814 --> 24:43.182
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

24:43.215 --> 24:45.785
NO, NO,
THAT'S IT, THANK YOU.

24:48.054 --> 24:48.955
AND HERE WE GO.

24:52.559 --> 24:53.693
[SALLY]: YOU NEED
A BIT MORE COFFEE.

24:53.726 --> 24:56.062
I'M GOING TO NEED
A NEW ASSIGNMENT.

24:56.095 --> 24:59.599
I THINK MAYBE
A NEW APPROACH.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.167
BUT HE'S PROBABLY OUT
GETTING A RESTRAINING ORDER

25:01.200 --> 25:02.602
RIGHT NOW!

25:02.635 --> 25:05.304
SINCE WHEN WOULD
THAT EVEN BOTHER YOU?

25:05.337 --> 25:06.873
JUST HOW MUCH
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME?

25:09.609 --> 25:11.744
I KNOW THAT
YOU WERE DRIVEN.

25:11.778 --> 25:12.979
PEOPLE THINK THAT

25:13.012 --> 25:15.715
YOU'RE VERY RELENTLESS
AND AMBITIOUS.

25:15.748 --> 25:16.749
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
THINK OF ME?

25:16.783 --> 25:18.017
IT IS.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.218
YOU KNOW, THEY CALL
YOU "THE POACHER."

25:21.788 --> 25:23.322
MY CAT!

25:23.355 --> 25:24.757
I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT HIM!

25:24.791 --> 25:26.025
HE'S ALL ALONE.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.962
[MAN]: SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.031
SHE WAS IN A
TERRIBLE ACCIDENT,

25:32.064 --> 25:35.101
AND I HAVEN'T NOTICED ANYBODY
COME BY TO LOOK AFTER HER.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.569
DON'T WORRY, EVE.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.705
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF FORBES.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.139
DO YOU LIKE CHRISTMAS?

25:40.172 --> 25:41.974
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
STAYING WITH ME AND TINSEL.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.309
YES, YOU ARE.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.913
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE WOULD DO THAT FOR ME.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.081
IT'S AS THOUGH NO ONE
EVER LIVED HERE.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.253
I MEAN,
I HARDLY SPEAK TO HER.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.055
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
NEIGHBORS ARE FOR, DEAR,

25:56.088 --> 25:57.657
YOU KNOW, TO HELP
EACH OTHER OUT.

25:57.690 --> 26:01.027
I'M JUST NOT SURE
THAT I WOULD DO THE SAME.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.161
WELL, MAYBE THIS
IS YOUR CHANCE

26:02.194 --> 26:03.630
TO REDEEM YOURSELF.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.265
OH, WHO ARE
THESE PEOPLE?

26:06.298 --> 26:08.935
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.269
THEY WERE JUST IN THE FRAME
WHEN I BOUGHT IT.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.871
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE
TO PUT A PICTURE IN THERE.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.841
REALLY?

26:14.874 --> 26:16.075
YEAH.

26:17.143 --> 26:20.112
AND REFRIGERATOR IS...?

26:20.146 --> 26:21.748
IT'S THERE.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.382
-THIS?
-UH-HUH.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.652
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

26:25.685 --> 26:26.619
WELL, THERE'S NO FOOD!

26:26.653 --> 26:28.855
I ATE OUT A LOT.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.293
SO, OKAY...

26:34.326 --> 26:35.795
HOW DOES THIS REALLY EVEN WORK?

26:35.828 --> 26:38.798
I MEAN, WHAT DO I DO?
WHERE DO I GO?

26:38.831 --> 26:40.633
YOU CAN GO
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.168
DO I SLEEP?

26:42.201 --> 26:45.271
YOU KNOW THE OLD ADAGE,
"YOU'LL SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD?"

26:45.304 --> 26:46.673
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.674
OH.

26:48.775 --> 26:49.876
DO I EAT?

26:49.909 --> 26:50.977
YOU CAN EAT
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

26:51.010 --> 26:51.844
YOU WILL NEVER
PUT ON WEIGHT.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.680
WOW.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.781
WELL...

26:56.849 --> 26:58.350
AND YOU ACTUALLY THINK

26:58.384 --> 27:00.319
THAT I CAN CHANGE
SOMEONE'S LIFE?

27:00.352 --> 27:02.288
I ABSOLUTELY DO.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.289
WHY?

27:05.324 --> 27:07.760
WELL, YOU PICK STOCKS,
AND I PICK PEOPLE,

27:07.794 --> 27:08.728
AND I PICKED YOU.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.432
UNCLE MAX!

27:13.465 --> 27:15.367
-HI, KIDDO!
-JOE!

27:15.401 --> 27:16.736
WHERE YOU BEEN AT, GIRL?

27:16.769 --> 27:18.805
WE GOT A YO-YO LESSON.

27:18.838 --> 27:22.308
NOW LOOK, THIS HERE
IS CALLED "WALK THE REINDEER,"

27:22.341 --> 27:24.076
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH "WALK THE DOG."

27:24.110 --> 27:26.045
YOU GUYS HAVE FUN?

27:26.078 --> 27:27.880
YEAH.
WE TOOK HER SHOPPING.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.216
WE GOT HER SOME THINGS
FOR THE WARMER WEATHER.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.084
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER, DID YOU?

27:32.118 --> 27:34.921
NO, BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.422
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
REMINDING ME, MARLA.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.125
APPARENTLY, I DO.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.028
SHE SPENDS FOUR NIGHTS
A WEEK IN A DINER,

27:42.061 --> 27:43.996
AND THAT IS NO PLACE
FOR A LITTLE GIRL.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.298
YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT
WORSE BY WAITING.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.000
HOW COULD IT
POSSIBLY BE WORSE?

27:54.506 --> 27:55.441
THERE YOU GO.

27:56.843 --> 27:57.944
BACK FOR A REFILL?

27:57.977 --> 27:59.211
YES, PLEASE...

27:59.245 --> 28:01.480
AND, UM, I'LL HAVE
WHATEVER SHE'S HAVING.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.782
MM, ANGEL FOOD.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.050
WHAT?

28:04.083 --> 28:05.217
SHE MEANS MY CAKE.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.086
OH.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.855
YES, YES...

28:08.888 --> 28:09.989
AND SOME PIE.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.323
APPLE OR CHERRY?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.424
BOTH?

28:12.458 --> 28:14.326
DID A BOY JUST BREAK UP
WITH YOU?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.028
NO.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.797
THEN WHY ARE YOU ORDERING
THREE DESSERTS?

28:17.830 --> 28:19.065
WELL...

28:20.867 --> 28:22.301
I JUST FOUND OUT

28:22.334 --> 28:25.104
THAT I CAN EAT WHATEVER I WANT
AND NOT GAIN WEIGHT.

28:25.137 --> 28:25.972
[GASPS]

28:26.005 --> 28:27.006
ME TOO!

28:28.107 --> 28:29.375
I'M LAUREN.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.811
HI. I'M EVE.

28:31.844 --> 28:32.845
LIKE CHRISTMAS EVE.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.247
THAT'S RIGHT! YES!

28:35.281 --> 28:36.482
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

28:36.515 --> 28:37.984
MY SCHOOL PLAY.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.285
IT'S TONIGHT, AND...

28:39.318 --> 28:40.486
I DON'T HAVE
THE LINES DOWN.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.221
UH-OH...

28:42.254 --> 28:43.289
LET ME HAVE A LOOK.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.992
HMM...

28:46.025 --> 28:49.796
OOH, "HARK, YE SHEPHERDS,
COMETH THY FLOCK IN JOY."

28:49.829 --> 28:51.530
YIKES!

28:51.563 --> 28:52.865
WOW. THANK YOU.

28:52.899 --> 28:53.766
DO YOU HAVE A PEN
I COULD BORROW?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.034
YEAH.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.769
OKAY, SO,
I HAVE THIS MEMORY TRICK.

28:56.803 --> 29:00.873
I USED TO USE IT TO REMEMBER
CLIENTS' INFORMATION.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.943
SO YOU TAKE EACH LETTER
FROM THE BEGINNING,

29:03.976 --> 29:05.377
AND YOU SAY,

29:05.411 --> 29:07.213
"HEY, YOU SHARKS,

29:07.246 --> 29:12.351
COVER THAT FELLOW IN JAM,"

29:12.384 --> 29:15.321
AND THEN EACH LETTER
CORRESPONDS TO YOUR LINE.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.089
DO YOU WANT TO TRY?

29:18.524 --> 29:22.261
HARK, YE SHEPHERDS,
COMETH THY FLOCK IN JOY.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.063
I DID IT!
UNCLE MAX, I DID IT!

29:24.096 --> 29:25.231
[EVE]:
THAT'S SO GOOD.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.034
THANKS.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.937
CAKE AND PIE AND... PIE
ARE ON THE HOUSE.

29:30.970 --> 29:31.804
THANK YOU.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.874
UM...

29:34.907 --> 29:36.208
WE KIND OF GOT OFF
TO A ROUGH START,

29:36.242 --> 29:39.078
SO I APOLOGIZE.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.379
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.248
OKAY.

29:43.415 --> 29:44.316
YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?

29:44.350 --> 29:45.484
MM...

29:45.517 --> 29:48.454
I'M IN THE PROCESS
OF RELOCATING.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.823
YOU MUST BE
THE FAVORITE UNCLE.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.358
THAT'S ME.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.492
ARE HER PARENTS ON HOLIDAY?

29:55.928 --> 29:57.997
NO, THEY'RE, UM...

30:01.600 --> 30:03.535
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT
GOING ON TWO YEARS NOW.

30:03.569 --> 30:06.072
HER MOM WAS MY SISTER.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.039
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.110
I'M SORRY.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.445
THEY MADE ME GUARDIAN
IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.215
I JUST, UH...

30:16.248 --> 30:17.116
NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.420
CAN EVE COME
TO MY PLAY TONIGHT?

30:21.453 --> 30:24.090
I THINK
SHE'S PROBABLY BUSY, SWEETIE.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.424
I WOULD LOVE
TO "COMETH."

30:26.959 --> 30:28.294
YOU DO REALIZE

30:28.327 --> 30:30.429
THAT IT'S A 5TH GRADE
CHRISTMAS PLAY, RIGHT?

30:30.462 --> 30:31.931
YES!

30:31.964 --> 30:34.200
WHERE IS THAT THEATRICAL EVENT
HAPPENING?

30:34.233 --> 30:37.003
GROVER CLEVELAND
ELEMENTARY, ON 17TH?

30:38.604 --> 30:41.941
DO YOU-- DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
THESE BROTHERS,

30:41.974 --> 30:43.475
BOBBY AND CALEB MORGAN?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.111
DO YOU KNOW THEM?

30:45.144 --> 30:47.513
YEAH, THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE SHEPHERDS IN OUR PLAY,

30:47.546 --> 30:50.216
BUT THEY HAD SOME SORT
OF FAMILY EMERGENCY.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.617
LAUREN, COME HELP ME
WITH WHIPPED CREAM!

30:54.286 --> 30:56.255
SO I GUESS MAYBE WE SHOULD
EXCHANGE NUMBERS?

30:56.288 --> 30:58.857
YOU KNOW, IN CASE THE CRITICS
CLOSE THE PLAY EARLY?

31:00.226 --> 31:01.660
I, I... I LOST MY PHONE.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.429
YOU LOST...?

31:03.462 --> 31:05.131
YEAH, I...
I SHOULD GO.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.398
OH, SURE.

31:06.432 --> 31:07.266
THANK YOU.

31:07.299 --> 31:08.968
BYE.

31:09.001 --> 31:09.902
I GOT THIS.

31:09.936 --> 31:10.970
BYE.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.008
SHE'S NOT COMING, IS SHE?

31:17.476 --> 31:19.278
LOST HER PHONE.

31:45.004 --> 31:48.074
THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU
OR SEE YOU.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.676
THIS IS WHAT
WE CALL "GAZING."

31:52.178 --> 31:53.645
IT'S THE GUARDIAN
ANGEL'S WAY

31:53.679 --> 31:55.481
OF LOOKING IN
ON THOSE WE LOVE.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.016
[TYLER]: HEY, GUYS.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.685
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:59.718 --> 32:02.321
MAKING PICTURES
FOR AUNT EVE.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.291
SO SHE CAN BE HERE WITH US,
EVEN WHEN SHE CAN'T BE.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.327
SHE'D LOVE
BOTH OF THESE.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:47.150
I HAVE MORE TIME.

01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:49.218
NO, YOU DON'T.
NOT REALLY.

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:52.656
BUT WHY WOULD YOU PUNISH ME
FOR FINISHING EARLY?

01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:53.657
[CRYING] I MEAN,
I JUST STARTED.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:54.958
IT CAN'T BE OVER.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.793
I'M NOT PUNISHING YOU.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.127
WHY AM I CRYING?

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:00.029
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE ABLE TO CRY, RIGHT?

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:02.699
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
AN ANGEL ANYMORE.

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:04.934
-WHAT?
-NO.

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:06.603
ALL RIGHT, I TAMPERED
WITH THE RULES.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:09.205
LET ME TELL YOU.

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:12.141
YOUR BODY DID NOT DIE
WHEN YOU FELL ON THE ICE.

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:13.943
YOU MEAN,
I'M ACTUALLY ALIVE?

01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:16.713
YOUR BODY IS IN THE
HOSPITAL, IN A COMA,

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:18.848
AND I WAS THINKING

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:22.652
THAT IF I COULD HELP YOU
CHANGE YOUR LIFE DOWN THERE

01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:24.688
BY PUTTING YOU
TO WORK UP HERE,

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:30.226
THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
A DOUBLE CHRISTMAS MIRACLE,

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.728
AS IT WERE.

01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:34.063
SO, I CAN GO BACK,

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:35.799
AND I CAN SEE MY FAMILY,

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:38.001
AND I CAN SEE
MAX AND LAUREN?

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.302
YES, BUT MAX AND LAUREN
WON'T REMEMBER YOU.

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:41.605
THEY WON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:43.840
NOW, THE LIGHT
THAT YOU SHINED ON THEM,

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:47.811
YES, THEY WILL ALWAYS
HAVE THAT WITH THEM,

01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:50.146
BUT THEY WON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:51.648
BUT I CAN FIND THEM AGAIN.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:53.149
I CAN START AGAIN.

01:15:53.182 --> 01:15:55.819
NO, YOU WON'T
REMEMBER ANY OF THIS.

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:58.021
YOU WON'T REMEMBER
THE TAXI CAB DRIVE, AND...

01:15:59.656 --> 01:16:00.957
YOU WON'T REMEMBER ME,

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.058
AND YOU WON'T REMEMBER

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.093
WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE AN ANGEL.

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:09.032
COME.

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:18.107
YOU SAVED THEM, EVE.

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:22.011
THEY SAVED ME.

I WAS DREAMING.

01:17:01.184 --> 01:17:03.219
REALLY?
WHAT WERE YOU DREAMING?

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:07.156
I'M NOT SURE.
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.357
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE?

01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:09.693
NEVER MIND.
NONE OF THAT IS IMPORTANT.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:10.860
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS YOU'RE BACK,

01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:12.061
AND YOUR FAMILY
WILL BE SO THRILLED.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.963
