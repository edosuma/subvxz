04:36.577 --> 04:39.177
It is definitely something
about the Marching Storm,

04:39.246 --> 04:42.180
because this band
is full of romance.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.949
We actually have a lot of
relationships in the band,

04:44.018 --> 04:45.183
and normally that's
where a lot of people

04:45.252 --> 04:47.753

-With you leaving?
-Yeah, like...

04:56.230 --> 04:57.696
It's gonna be different.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.264
It is, most definitely.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.900
You could come to Dallas.
You can come visit.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.969
And I'd come down here,
most likely.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.738
But like I said,
I'm probably gonna be
doing grad school here.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.040
So you're probably
gonna be out of school

05:08.108 --> 05:09.775
by the time I finish.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.243
Oh, so I'm gonna be gone,

05:11.312 --> 05:12.511
so what are you gonna do?

05:12.579 --> 05:16.014
We got FaceTimes.
We go on vacations.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.883

able to laugh with them

05:39.273 --> 05:41.640

and feel welcome.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.375

06:29.757 --> 06:32.023

06:32.092 --> 06:33.759
<i> 'Cause we're practicing</i>
<i> a little harder.</i>

06:33.827 --> 06:35.026
<i> The intensity goes from,</i>

<i> "I'm just doing this</i>
<i> because I got to,"</i>

06:38.232 --> 06:41.266

<i> There's a lot of people with</i>
<i> many talents in drum line,</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.741
so I wouldn't say I'm the best,
but I'm at the top,

06:49.810 --> 06:51.176
I can tell you that.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.579
(upbeat hip-hop music)

06:54.648 --> 06:56.581
I had the chicken
tenders with fries,

06:56.650 --> 06:58.817
and you gotta season it
up good though, bruh.

06:58.886 --> 07:02.354
Today, I'm meeting up with
Aaron, to go over my interest

07:02.423 --> 07:04.389
in becoming
drum major next season.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.626
Man, do you see how
little this ranch is, bro?

07:09.730 --> 07:13.532
Hey, you better dip
with conservation in mind.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.434
(Tre laughing)

07:15.502 --> 07:17.169
<i> My environment growing up,</i>

07:17.237 --> 07:20.038
it was a lot of gang activity,

07:20.107 --> 07:22.841
and there was a lot of
negative influence around.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.743
<i> Tre, you know, that's my boy.</i>

07:24.812 --> 07:28.113
<i> I really, really do see a lot</i>
<i> of myself in that young man.</i>

07:28.182 --> 07:30.282
It's just a blessing
that both of us was able

07:30.350 --> 07:32.184
to make it to college.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.554
I hear you're kinda interested
in the spot of drum major.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.389
I just wanted to know how
you're feeling about that.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.657
Like what you thinking.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.158
The main thing that
I'm worried about

07:40.227 --> 07:45.197
is the balance between
school, being a father,

07:45.265 --> 07:47.799
worrying about my girl,
you know.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.735
You literally have
life and school,

07:50.804 --> 07:52.604
both serious right now.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.507
There's three parts of being
an efficient drum major.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.610
Musicianship, leadership,
and showmanship.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.312
Just focus on those.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.714
So Tre is telling me he
wants to be a drum major.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.983
I'm like, I can see it,

08:05.052 --> 08:06.751
but they don't have
the slightest idea

08:06.820 --> 08:09.855
<i> how much they gonna really</i>
<i> have to do once they get on.</i>

08:09.923 --> 08:11.256
<i> Since he's had his child.</i>

08:11.325 --> 08:13.525
<i> I don't know if he prepared</i>
<i> for what is to come,</i>

08:13.594 --> 08:14.860
being a drum major.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.430
I'm gonna just say this, man,
homecoming, I don't know.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.333
You know how we used
to have like the tailgate--

08:21.401 --> 08:23.335
But I hear,
that's what I'm saying,

08:23.403 --> 08:26.571
I'm hoping it's still
the same experience,

08:26.640 --> 08:29.774
because I want the young
people to get this experience.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.910
That's one experience
I won't ever forget.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.446
Literally.
They said we cannot tailgate.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.414
I just want people to
just pull up, just 'cause.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.250
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.920
If it ain't no tailgate, at
least the game gotta be stupid.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.154
Gotta be.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.456
Alright, bro,

08:44.525 --> 08:45.957

I'm good.

09:35.092 --> 09:36.258
<i> I am a mama's boy.</i>

09:36.326 --> 09:38.627
So not being up the street
from my mother

09:38.695 --> 09:40.528
is heartbreaking, really.

09:42.566 --> 09:44.966
<i> How's homecoming?</i>

09:45.035 --> 09:47.369
Band practice, band practice,
and more band practice.

09:47.437 --> 09:49.237
<i> What are you going to do,</i>

09:49.306 --> 09:52.507
<i> besides band practice,</i>
<i> band practice, band practice?</i>

09:52.576 --> 09:54.743
Biggest party goer.

09:54.811 --> 09:57.646
So that's the hard
part about college.

09:57.714 --> 10:00.115
<i> You know I'm following PV</i>

10:00.183 --> 10:01.650
<i> on Facebook, Instagram.</i>

10:01.718 --> 10:03.451
Look, your PV social life

10:03.520 --> 10:06.121
is probably
way better than mine.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.057
(Kanika laughing)

10:09.126 --> 10:10.959
<i> I feel like</i>
<i> I know everybody now.</i>

10:11.028 --> 10:12.160
<i> I don't even go there.</i>

10:12.229 --> 10:13.695
You probably know
more people than I do,

10:13.764 --> 10:14.863
but it's different.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.331
It's very different than Dallas.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.632
<i> I miss my family so much,</i>

10:17.701 --> 10:19.901
<i> I cannot even tell you</i>
<i> how much I miss them.</i>

10:19.970 --> 10:21.736
<i> It's unexplainable.</i>

10:21.805 --> 10:24.906
<i> Adjusting to being</i>
<i> on campus is very hard.</i>

10:24.975 --> 10:26.741
<i> I get homesick a lot.</i>

10:26.810 --> 10:30.178
I've had times where I
was sitting on the floor,

10:30.247 --> 10:34.316
literally crying because I
had no clue what I was doing.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.885
<i> How you feeling</i>
<i> after the accident?</i>

10:36.953 --> 10:39.487
<i> I mean, you had me scared.</i>

10:39.556 --> 10:43.858
My back is in pain,
but it's manageable.

10:43.927 --> 10:45.860
I was leaving
a homecoming party.

10:45.929 --> 10:49.431
So as I was making a U-turn
to head back to campus,

10:49.499 --> 10:52.267
the young lady behind me decides
that I was taking too long

10:52.336 --> 10:54.069
and she wanted to go around me.

10:54.137 --> 10:57.038
<i> So she knocks off</i>
<i> the whole front end of my car.</i>

10:57.107 --> 10:59.274
The incident was a hit and run.

10:59.343 --> 11:00.742
I feel okay.

11:00.811 --> 11:03.511
I just hope that I can actually
perform for homecoming.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.979
It's my first homecoming.

11:05.048 --> 11:06.948
<i> You gotta take care</i>
<i> of yourself first.</i>

11:07.017 --> 11:09.484
Yeah, cover me
in your righteous word.

11:09.553 --> 11:12.687
You know,
give me a good prayer.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.123
<i> Father God,</i>
<i> we thank you for this day.</i>

11:15.192 --> 11:17.425
<i>Protect him, not only just him,</i>

11:17.494 --> 11:19.661
<i> continue to protect</i>
<i> his band members, Lord,</i>

11:19.730 --> 11:21.029
<i> and just watch over them</i>

11:21.098 --> 11:23.598
<i> as they go throughout this</i>
<i> homecoming week, Lord.</i>

11:23.667 --> 11:25.700
<i> I just ask all of this,</i>
<i> Father God,</i>

11:25.769 --> 11:27.936
<i> in Jesus' name we pray, amen.</i>

11:28.004 --> 11:29.137
Amen.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.172
<i> Amen!</i>

11:31.208 --> 11:32.874
<i> -I love you.</i>
-I love you too.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.042
<i> I'll talk to you later.</i>

11:34.111 --> 11:35.643
I can't wait to talk
to you later, bye, Mom.

11:35.712 --> 11:38.113
(upbeat music)

11:38.181 --> 11:42.016
<i> ♪ And I'm missing, missing,</i>
<i> missing, missing you ♪</i>

11:42.886 --> 11:46.388
(upbeat drum music)

11:50.394 --> 11:53.561
(flutes whistling)

11:57.167 --> 11:58.800
Woman:
'Cause y'all are going flat,
push in a little.

11:58.869 --> 12:01.102
Martayvia:
<i> So I'm gonna go talk</i>
<i> to my section today.</i>

12:01.171 --> 12:03.071
<i> I haven't seen them</i>
<i> in a good minute.</i>

12:03.140 --> 12:04.339
I am their leader,

12:04.408 --> 12:06.474
and so I feel like I just
left them high and dry.

12:06.543 --> 12:07.809
<i> So I owe them an explanation</i>

12:07.878 --> 12:10.345
of why I'm gonna not be
marching for homecoming.

12:10.414 --> 12:12.647
-Oh my God, it's her!
-Hi.

12:12.716 --> 12:13.982
Hey yo.

12:14.050 --> 12:15.750
-Hey.
-Hey!

12:15.819 --> 12:18.553
Child, I just wanted
to come talk to y'all.

12:18.622 --> 12:19.754
What's up?

12:19.823 --> 12:21.322
Martayvia:
I'm not finna be
in band no more.

12:21.391 --> 12:23.658
Like you gone,
like gone, gone or?

12:23.727 --> 12:24.726
Oh wow.

12:24.795 --> 12:26.995
That's what Doc said,
and everything?

12:27.063 --> 12:29.831
That really sucks, especially
since it's your last year.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.499
Martayvia:
But I'm sorry, y'all.

12:31.568 --> 12:33.535
I know I should have
set a better example.

12:33.603 --> 12:34.936
We're gonna miss you.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.271
Martayvia:
Oh my God.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.140
Y'all ain't gonna miss me.
(laughs)

12:39.209 --> 12:40.975
I'm gonna miss y'all too.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.078
What y'all been working on?

12:44.147 --> 12:45.346
Woman:
Well, we got this piece.

12:45.415 --> 12:46.648
If you could listen around,

12:46.716 --> 12:49.017
and if you hear
anything I don't hear,

12:49.085 --> 12:50.585
just let me know.

12:50.654 --> 12:51.419
Okay.

12:51.488 --> 12:53.188
Woman:
One, two, ready, and--

12:53.256 --> 12:56.157
(flutes whistling)

13:00.797 --> 13:02.664
Me being away doesn't
change my relationship

13:02.732 --> 13:03.765
with the piccolos.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.433
<i>I really miss performing a lot,</i>

13:05.502 --> 13:08.236
<i> and to see the band</i>
<i> still continuing</i>

13:08.305 --> 13:09.938
<i> makes me a little bit jealous.</i>

13:10.006 --> 13:11.706
I'm finna try to see if
I can work some stuff out

13:11.775 --> 13:13.942
with Dr. Zachery so I'll be
able to get back in band.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.611
<i> If it wasn't for the band, I</i>
<i> wouldn't be where I am today.</i>

13:16.680 --> 13:18.079
So I'm always
rooting for the band.

13:18.148 --> 13:21.115
It doesn't matter if I'm in
the band, or outside the band.

13:21.184 --> 13:23.017
It doesn't matter if it's
gonna be 10 years later,

13:23.086 --> 13:25.320
I'm gonna always
be rooting for the Storm.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.623

13:33.430 --> 13:35.563

13:46.176 --> 13:47.609
<i> I've been good, you know.</i>

13:47.677 --> 13:49.377
Kaylan:
<i> Courtney is my boyfriend.</i>

13:49.446 --> 13:51.112
<i> We met during</i>
<i> summer band camp.</i>

13:51.181 --> 13:52.814
<i> When I was a freshman in 2018,</i>

13:52.883 --> 13:54.516
<i> he was the trumpet</i>
<i> section leader,</i>

13:54.584 --> 13:56.217
<i> and I was just</i>
<i> a freshman Black Fox.</i>

13:56.286 --> 13:57.752
At first, we were just friends.

13:57.821 --> 13:59.020
He was real cool.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.456
Then over time we just
became closer and closer.

14:01.525 --> 14:03.191
Courtney:
<i> How you been?</i>

14:03.260 --> 14:04.659
It's been going and going.

14:04.728 --> 14:07.061
So we're trying to
prepare for homecoming.

14:07.130 --> 14:09.197
<i> I am so excited</i>
<i> that my boyfriend</i>

14:09.266 --> 14:10.665
will be here for homecoming.

14:10.734 --> 14:12.133
He lives four hours away,

14:12.202 --> 14:15.003
and we only get to FaceTime
about once, twice a day.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.739
'Cause he's either teaching,
or I'm at practice.

14:17.807 --> 14:19.908
We never really get
time to just sit down

14:19.976 --> 14:21.676
and talk and be with each other.

14:21.745 --> 14:23.144
I don't know if you have seen,

14:23.213 --> 14:25.747
but the band got some
attention from Chloe.

14:25.815 --> 14:27.916
You know, the one who
sings "Have Mercy."

14:27.984 --> 14:30.985
She had actually
retweeted our video,

14:31.054 --> 14:33.288
of us playing her song at
the State Fair Classic.

14:33.356 --> 14:36.090
-That last Saturday,
my alma mater--
-Yes!

14:36.159 --> 14:38.526
Prairie View A&M
University played your song,

14:38.595 --> 14:39.627
"Have Mercy."

14:39.696 --> 14:42.897
(instrumental version
of "Have Mercy")

14:46.403 --> 14:48.503
Loni Love:
You gave your thumbs up to it.

14:48.572 --> 14:49.971
So I was like, there you go!

14:50.040 --> 14:51.339
I was so happy seeing that.

14:51.408 --> 14:53.508
It felt like I was,
like, in drum line.

14:53.577 --> 14:55.577
I felt like I was
seen by a celebrity.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.811
Like I was like,

14:56.880 --> 14:58.246
"Whoa, she got the blue
check and everything."

14:58.315 --> 14:59.747
It seemed pretty cool.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.550
<i> Wow, by having Chloe,</i>
<i> and she poppin' right now,</i>

15:02.619 --> 15:04.152
<i> that's what you'll be</i>
<i> needing to go ahead</i>

15:04.220 --> 15:05.954
<i> and take this band so it</i>
<i> can go to the next level.</i>

15:06.022 --> 15:08.556
<i>Especially in this dance world,</i>
<i> by having you...</i>

15:08.625 --> 15:10.158
(indistinct)

15:10.226 --> 15:12.527
<i> You've been all</i>
<i> over social media.</i>

15:12.596 --> 15:13.861
<i> So it's not only for you,</i>

15:13.930 --> 15:15.496
<i> but it's good for</i>
<i> the whole band as well.</i>

15:15.565 --> 15:16.431
<i> It's really what we needed.</i>

15:16.499 --> 15:19.367
Wow, a celebrity watched us.

15:19.436 --> 15:21.369
That can open so many doors,

15:21.438 --> 15:24.372
not just for the Black Foxes,
but for the Marching Storm.

15:24.441 --> 15:26.641
It's my last homecoming,
so it's kind of bittersweet.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.776
And we didn't have one last
year, so I'm just excited.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.778
<i> I've got you</i>
<i> some bad news now.</i>

15:30.847 --> 15:32.213
Oh my, okay.

15:32.282 --> 15:33.881
<i> Well, I've got Saturday</i>
<i> school this weekend...</i>

15:33.950 --> 15:35.116
Kaylan: Okay.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.451
<i> The weekend of homecoming,</i>

15:36.519 --> 15:38.353
<i> so I may not be able to come.</i>

15:38.421 --> 15:40.288
<i> I'm definitely gonna</i>
<i> try to make it though.</i>

15:40.357 --> 15:41.489
<i> But, we'll see.</i>

15:41.558 --> 15:42.957
He definitely
needs to make it.

15:43.026 --> 15:46.027
This is one of the most
important games of my season.

15:46.096 --> 15:48.830
<i> The goal for us always</i>
<i> to move to Dallas together.</i>

15:48.865 --> 15:50.565
<i> So, by you being away,</i>

15:50.634 --> 15:52.367
<i> I don't know how this whole</i>
<i> thing's gonna work out.</i>

15:52.435 --> 15:54.469
<i> But that's something we</i>
<i> definitely gotta speak about.</i>

15:54.537 --> 15:57.105
<i> Because I don't want that</i>
<i> to become a problem, you know?</i>

15:57.173 --> 15:58.473
I don't think
it's gonna be a problem,

15:58.541 --> 16:00.341
we've done it well this far.

16:00.410 --> 16:02.744
We've stayed strong
this whole semester.

16:02.812 --> 16:04.445
We'll be back together soon.

16:05.482 --> 16:06.948
<i> I guess, we'll see.</i>

16:07.017 --> 16:08.783
(dramatic music)

16:08.852 --> 16:10.485
Courtney and I have
a lot to think about.

16:10.553 --> 16:11.686
It's gonna be a challenge,

16:11.755 --> 16:14.422
but we were always good
with long distance.

16:14.491 --> 16:16.157
<i> So we'll just see.</i>

16:27.687 --> 16:29.187
Okay.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.790
Hey, big mama.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.893
(La'Monica speaks indistinctly)

16:35.962 --> 16:38.262
Tre:<i> The story of me</i>
<i> and La'Monica is,</i>

16:38.331 --> 16:40.665
<i> I first met her through</i>
<i> her brother, Philip.</i>

16:40.734 --> 16:42.100
<i> It's about three</i>
<i> and a half years ago.</i>

16:42.168 --> 16:43.868
<i> She used to be in the band.</i>

16:43.937 --> 16:46.070
<i> After once, we first hung out,</i>

16:46.139 --> 16:47.772
<i> it was just like,</i>
<i> she was my best friend.</i>

16:47.841 --> 16:49.240
<i> So we hung out every day,</i>

16:49.309 --> 16:53.344
and after a year, and
then became my girlfriend.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.679
Hey girl.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.013
What's up, big mama?

16:56.082 --> 16:57.615
You know we got
homecoming coming up.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.052
So, we gotta figure out what
we gonna do with Ariana.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.388
I know she was supposed
to go to your mama house.

17:03.456 --> 17:06.190
I'd rather her go to
Houston than to Dallas.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.126
I don't wanna drive,
that's the problem.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.660
But the baby will be closer.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.062
Tre:
<i> Before we go to sleep,</i>

17:11.131 --> 17:13.998
<i> we tell like the plans</i>
<i> that we have for the day,</i>

17:14.067 --> 17:16.067
so that way we can
map out the times

17:16.136 --> 17:18.770
where I'll have the baby,
she'll have the baby,

17:18.838 --> 17:21.339
or we'll have somebody
to watch the baby.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.474
Why is you sucking on
your hand like that?

17:23.543 --> 17:26.210
-Why?
-Is it good? Let me taste.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.879
Let me taste.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.447
La'Monica:
It's not funny.

17:29.516 --> 17:34.685
Tre:<i> Balancing school,</i>
<i> being a father, and band</i>

17:34.754 --> 17:37.488
is definitely not
a task for the weak.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.891
You know, this is
like my last homecoming.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.860
It just gonna be weird 'cause
I'm finna start, like, life.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.863
-Technically our life started.
-Baby, we already started.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.800
But, I mean,
like outside of school.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.735
I wanna be a dance teacher.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.905
And I feel like in Houston,

17:53.973 --> 17:56.274
it would come easier
for me to get a job.

40:40.956 --> 40:42.789
When I first got
into the car accident,

40:42.858 --> 40:44.290
-I was like, "I'm not gonna"--
-(Kanika mocking)

40:44.359 --> 40:45.658
"That's why I don't
go nowhere, Mama.

40:45.727 --> 40:48.228
I just stay in my dorm,
I don't do nothin'."

40:48.296 --> 40:51.030
-But it's okay.
-You had to put me out
there crying like that?

40:51.099 --> 40:52.665
(Kanika laughing)

Dr. Z:<i> For the next game,</i>

41:09.017 --> 41:10.850

41:10.919 --> 41:13.920
Whoever is leadership
next year, I'm very excited.

41:13.989 --> 41:15.989
All I can say is good luck.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.724
Really have to know
how to talk to people.

41:17.792 --> 41:19.492
You need to work on that.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.060

-Now running.
