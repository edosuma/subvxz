WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.750
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:54.541 --> 00:56.083
Coming.

00:58.916 --> 01:00.375
Coming.

01:15.750 --> 01:19.333
CRISTINA AND CARLO ARE DELIGHTED
TO ANNOUNCE THEIR WEDDING

01:22.833 --> 01:23.875
Can you help me?

01:23.958 --> 01:27.583
I got everything.
Multivitamins, paracetamol, ibuprofen.

01:29.458 --> 01:35.708
AN ASTROLOGICAL GUIDE FOR BROKEN HEARTS

01:35.916 --> 01:39.458
LEO

01:40.750 --> 01:41.666
Leo.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.083
Do you still not get it?

01:49.750 --> 01:54.416
Unless you're really naive
or devoid of any aesthetic sensibility,

01:54.500 --> 01:58.458
as soon as you hear the word "Leo,"

01:58.958 --> 02:00.708
you should think reliable,

02:01.500 --> 02:02.541
safe,

02:03.375 --> 02:04.333
and strong.

02:05.541 --> 02:09.250
If you were so honored and fortunate

02:10.041 --> 02:12.708
to conquer the king of the jungle,

02:13.541 --> 02:18.250
just know that the rest of the world
will be deeply jealous.

02:23.958 --> 02:27.250
I figured you also received
the invitation to the wedding.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.291
It's all good.

02:31.208 --> 02:32.875
Remember he wasn't right for you.

02:33.666 --> 02:34.708
Yes, I know, but…

02:35.958 --> 02:37.666
at least he was something.

02:39.708 --> 02:40.583
I mean,

02:40.666 --> 02:41.500
look at me.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.375
I haven't had
a proper relationship since Carlo.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.166
I'm so lonely.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.250
I'm a lost cause.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.250
Come on!

02:54.333 --> 02:55.958
When the going gets tough…

02:56.583 --> 02:57.916
You give up?

02:58.916 --> 02:59.916
No.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.333
The tough get going.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.166
I'm trying, Paola.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.000
But last night
I dreamed of Carlo and his child.

03:16.833 --> 03:17.875
Oh, darling.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.875
Let's tidy up.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.916
And anyway, you know, so much has changed.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.166
Just think of your new show.

03:30.833 --> 03:35.166
You pretty much saved Dora TV
from going under.

03:37.916 --> 03:38.958
Quite a feat.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.750
Good girl.

03:43.916 --> 03:46.041
You're a superhero, Alice.

03:49.458 --> 03:52.791
And since when do superheroes get colds?

03:58.583 --> 04:00.791
Enough with these dark thoughts.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.166
The sun is shining.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.458
It's time for a nice hot bath.

04:04.541 --> 04:06.416
Believe me, you need one.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.416
Expecting someone?

04:18.541 --> 04:20.208
The Red Cross is here.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.416
Are you Paola?

04:24.500 --> 04:25.333
Yes.

04:26.708 --> 04:27.541
I'm Tio.

04:30.791 --> 04:32.416
Have you robbed a farmer?

04:33.375 --> 04:35.041
I got some leafy greens.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.166
They are rich in iron and zinc.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.125
My sick girl.

04:38.208 --> 04:40.625
I got garlic. Eat a whole one and bam!

04:40.708 --> 04:43.666
It boosts the immune system.
You're not kissing anyone anyway.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.708
And then I have…

04:44.791 --> 04:46.000
Oh my gosh!

04:46.083 --> 04:48.333
-Is that Sandrino?
-Yes.

04:48.416 --> 04:50.833
You are so gorgeous. Hello.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.833
Hi, cutie.

04:52.916 --> 04:56.000
I got some chicken so we can make soup.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.041
Some fresh ginger for tea.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.000
And then, Ali…

04:59.833 --> 05:00.666
some vitamins.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.916
I brought some too.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.958
Be good, please.

05:08.750 --> 05:09.916
How is she?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.958
We were fine until you arrived.

05:12.666 --> 05:13.666
Let's check now.

05:14.750 --> 05:15.833
Here you go, baby.

05:16.666 --> 05:17.500
Here.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.666
Hi.

05:20.541 --> 05:22.000
What a cute child.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.458
Who's here?

05:23.541 --> 05:26.166
He's so gorgeous, really.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.208
Hi, cutie. Do you like these?

05:28.291 --> 05:29.541
Look.

05:29.625 --> 05:33.791
I'll put them on my face
and they're like a chunky mustache.

05:35.541 --> 05:36.750
Do you want a hug?

05:36.833 --> 05:37.666
Yes.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.625
Now you have to pick him up.

05:39.708 --> 05:40.791
For real?

05:41.583 --> 05:44.208
I've never held such a small child.

05:44.291 --> 05:46.875
Put the veggies down, wash your hands.

05:47.458 --> 05:48.500
Okay.

05:48.583 --> 05:49.416
Here you go.

05:52.916 --> 05:54.416
You like Tio.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
Right?

05:55.583 --> 05:57.250
Here he is, baby boy.

05:57.833 --> 06:01.375
Be careful, he can be quite wriggly.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.458
Okay.

06:02.541 --> 06:04.541
Hold on.

06:06.958 --> 06:07.791
Okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.041
You're so good.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.416
You're good and so handsome.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.791
I think he likes you.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.250
I like him too.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.291
I like you too.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.208
Yes.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.166
Almost 38 degrees.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.208
Oh, no.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.166
Aunty Alice is sick.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.375
Having a son must be wonderful.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.291
Most of the time.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.125
But sometimes it's a real chore.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.125
I wonder how it must feel

06:42.250 --> 06:44.083
to know that you're responsible

06:44.166 --> 06:46.708
for a human being who relies fully on you.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.375
You know.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.208
Alice told me
how you take care of your gran.

06:54.958 --> 06:55.791
Shall I help?

06:57.625 --> 06:58.458
Hey.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.166
What is Mommy doing?

07:00.750 --> 07:02.708
She took the greens.

07:03.916 --> 07:05.208
Look, cookies!

07:05.291 --> 07:07.291
-Do you want one?
-No!

07:07.375 --> 07:10.166
These are for grown-ups only.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.500
-Aren't they?
-Oh, no.

07:11.583 --> 07:12.708
His cookies are here.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.208
Fuck, the tub!

07:15.291 --> 07:16.916
Bad Mommy.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.916
Shall we have a nap?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.541
You look exhausted.

07:20.625 --> 07:21.500
Let's go.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.125
Here.

07:27.458 --> 07:28.291
Hello?

07:28.375 --> 07:30.166
Yes, I am…

07:30.250 --> 07:32.333
Davide Sardi, I was looking for…

07:32.416 --> 07:33.250
Is Alice there?

07:33.333 --> 07:34.875
Hi, this is Paola.

07:34.958 --> 07:36.666
Alice is resting.

07:36.750 --> 07:37.583
Hi.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.166
Hey, Mimì.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.291
No, Paola. We met a few weeks ago.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.708
Of course. No, Mimì is

07:44.791 --> 07:45.708
my dog.

07:46.916 --> 07:47.833
<i>A dog.</i>

07:47.916 --> 07:50.166
<i>I can put Alice on. She just woke up.</i>

07:50.250 --> 07:51.083
Thanks.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.166
Hey, Mimì!

07:53.750 --> 07:54.875
Your boss.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.583
Davide.

07:58.458 --> 08:01.125
-And this?
-He didn't open it, don't worry.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.541
I managed to stop him.

08:08.166 --> 08:09.000
Hello?

08:09.083 --> 08:10.291
Hi, Alice.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.333
Sorry to call you on a Sunday.

08:12.416 --> 08:13.333
I wanted to

08:13.833 --> 08:15.041
see how you were.

08:15.541 --> 08:16.416
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:17.125 --> 08:18.041
I am…

08:18.125 --> 08:19.333
Have I got a fever?

08:19.416 --> 08:20.333
Yes, almost 38.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.833
Great.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.291
I'm good.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.458
<i>Glad to hear.</i>

08:24.541 --> 08:26.916
With Paola, you're in good hands.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.333
Yes, great hands.

08:30.541 --> 08:31.375
Anything else?

08:32.041 --> 08:32.875
<i>Yes.</i>

08:33.458 --> 08:35.541
<i>I heard back from Channel 8.</i>

08:35.625 --> 08:37.208
They have asked us

08:37.291 --> 08:40.166
to film the next episode
in a different location.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.833
<i>Somewhere evocative.</i>

08:42.666 --> 08:44.416
If you think of something…

08:44.500 --> 08:46.333
<i>Okay, I'll have a think.</i>

08:46.416 --> 08:47.500
Okay.

08:48.666 --> 08:50.666
If we still had Enrico…

08:56.458 --> 08:57.333
<i>No rush.</i>

08:58.750 --> 09:00.458
Focus on getting better.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.333
See you next week.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.833
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Alright.

09:04.916 --> 09:05.791
Bye.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.250
Hi Claudio.

09:22.541 --> 09:23.416
What's up?

09:24.958 --> 09:26.458
Why did he call on a Sunday?

09:26.541 --> 09:28.125
What's happening, Alice?

09:28.208 --> 09:29.333
In your own words.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.875
Nothing.

09:30.958 --> 09:32.541
Nothing, really.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.375
He's just softened up a little.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.750
And the other day he kissed me.

09:36.833 --> 09:37.666
-What?!
-Huh?!

09:37.750 --> 09:39.375
Yes, but it was nothing.

09:39.458 --> 09:40.750
A kiss on the cheek.

09:40.833 --> 09:41.958
A friendly thing.

09:45.041 --> 09:47.500
I have not forgiven him for firing Enrico.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.250
Well, you say nothing.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.875
It's not nothing at all.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.875
-What do you think, Paola?
-I agree, Tio.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.208
Stop it! Leave me alone!

10:00.375 --> 10:02.708
Do we know Davide Sardi's star sign?

10:02.791 --> 10:05.625
No, but now I'm curious too.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.458
Gosh, you look terrible.

10:26.958 --> 10:28.625
Are you sure you should be here?

10:29.208 --> 10:30.041
Coffee?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.750
-Morning, Loredana.
-Morning.

10:46.708 --> 10:47.708
-Morning.
-Hi.

10:48.666 --> 10:49.500
Good morning.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.291
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.250
Good morning.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.166
Hi.

11:08.791 --> 11:11.125
MAY THESE STARS GIVE YOU SOME STRENGTH.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.000
HOPE YOU'RE BETTER. CARLO

11:21.500 --> 11:23.083
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:23.833 --> 11:24.708
Feeling better?

11:24.791 --> 11:26.916
Yes, a little. Thank you.

11:27.541 --> 11:29.958
Have you spoken to Carlo lately?

11:31.458 --> 11:32.375
No.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.500
Not really.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.333
Why?

11:36.541 --> 11:37.541
Just curious.

11:37.625 --> 11:40.083
You tell each other everything, so…

11:41.666 --> 11:43.125
I wouldn't say so.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.291
But you claim to be friends.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.416
Are you really just friends?

11:53.041 --> 11:54.083
What?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.541
Yes, absolutely.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.625
Lately, I would say
we're more like acquaintances.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.041
Why did you break up with him?

12:06.083 --> 12:06.916
What?

12:07.833 --> 12:10.791
It's just that sometimes
I feel you broke his heart,

12:11.291 --> 12:13.083
and he hasn't fully recovered.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.125
Who, me?

12:15.208 --> 12:16.041
No.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.458
It was him…

12:23.291 --> 12:24.333
who broke my heart.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.041
And…

12:27.875 --> 12:29.500
is your heart still broken?

12:31.666 --> 12:33.291
<i>Why is she asking me this?</i>

12:34.208 --> 12:35.916
Alice, your tea.

12:36.958 --> 12:37.916
Thank you.

12:40.833 --> 12:42.875
So it's true, you're back.

12:42.958 --> 12:43.791
Yes.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.541
Thanks for the pasta.

12:45.625 --> 12:46.791
You're welcome.

12:46.875 --> 12:50.041
You used to love it when you were ill, so…

12:50.791 --> 12:51.916
The little stars.

12:52.750 --> 12:53.625
Right?

12:53.708 --> 12:54.875
They're special.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.208
Listen.

13:00.500 --> 13:04.375
Hey, wanna grab a drink together,
one of these evenings?

13:05.750 --> 13:07.750
So we could have a chat, you know.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.666
It's been a while

13:10.166 --> 13:11.625
since we've talked properly.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.541
What do you say?

13:13.541 --> 13:14.375
Well…

13:15.041 --> 13:17.958
Why does Cristina think
there's still something between us?

13:18.791 --> 13:19.625
What?

13:20.291 --> 13:21.291
What do you mean?

13:21.375 --> 13:24.166
She asked me
whether we are really just friends.

13:27.958 --> 13:28.875
No, well…

13:29.458 --> 13:30.458
That's absurd.

13:30.541 --> 13:32.541
I know, that's what I told her.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.250
Clearly, she's feeling insecure.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.166
I don't know.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.958
-Just talk to her.
-Sure.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.041
-Okay.
-Yes.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.083
And thank you.

13:41.750 --> 13:42.583
Thanks a lot.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.333
Come in.

13:58.041 --> 13:59.416
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.666
I wanted to discuss
a possible filming location.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.166
Sure.

14:11.666 --> 14:12.666
Have a seat.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.125
Thank you.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.083
Okay.

14:30.625 --> 14:31.458
Well,

14:31.541 --> 14:32.750
after you called,

14:34.208 --> 14:36.750
or maybe I was already thinking about it.

14:36.833 --> 14:40.500
Anyhow, I thought
about the Museum of Cinema.

14:41.666 --> 14:43.750
It would be a great setting.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.416
And why the cinema?

14:53.500 --> 14:56.541
Well, because we talk
about movie stars, don't we?

14:57.041 --> 15:01.125
And the world of cinema
is known as a <i>star system</i>.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.875
Obviously, I would have
to check the place out.

15:11.416 --> 15:12.250
I like it.

15:13.750 --> 15:14.583
Nice.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.875
We'll need to look
into getting authorization.

15:18.958 --> 15:20.375
I'll take care of that.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.375
Great.

15:22.958 --> 15:26.041
I'll check it out tomorrow
to see if we can use it.

15:26.666 --> 15:27.500
One more thing.

15:28.708 --> 15:29.541
Yes.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.458
I wanted to apologize.

15:37.208 --> 15:40.208
You know, the other night
when you were changing the tire.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.208
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

15:42.708 --> 15:44.166
That was inappropriate.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.791
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.000
If you misunderstood…

15:50.041 --> 15:52.375
<i>Ah, so I could have misunderstood.</i>

15:52.458 --> 15:53.708
We work together.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.041
And there are things…

15:57.208 --> 15:59.041
that are hard to explain.

16:01.458 --> 16:02.708
Anyway, I'm sorry.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.125
It's fine.

16:05.166 --> 16:06.125
Good.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.916
Oh, one last question.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.000
What's your star sign again?

16:13.083 --> 16:14.416
I never told you.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.208
It's a genius idea to film there.

16:37.291 --> 16:38.666
Let's go back to the kiss.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.416
What do you think?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.625
Does it mean something?

16:41.708 --> 16:42.916
Of course.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.083
Alice, come on!

16:44.166 --> 16:45.583
He even apologized.

16:45.666 --> 16:47.000
Yes, I know.

16:47.583 --> 16:48.625
Oh God.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.166
I am so confused.

16:52.541 --> 16:54.250
What do you think his sign is?

16:54.333 --> 16:58.041
I think it's time
you start figuring out who you are,

16:58.625 --> 17:00.166
my little Libra, huh?

17:06.125 --> 17:06.958
This

17:07.541 --> 17:09.750
is your astral chart.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.833
I started from the time you were born.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.291
11:45 am, right?

17:16.125 --> 17:17.833
Show a little more enthusiasm.

17:18.333 --> 17:21.000
This chart tells you
the position of stars and planets

17:21.083 --> 17:23.583
at the exact time that you were born.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.333
I'm sorry, Tio.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.375
I can't understand any of it.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.791
Preparing an astral chart is no easy feat.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.250
No, wait! I want to know everything.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.125
These are the 12 houses.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.708
As you should know by now,

17:40.791 --> 17:43.875
each house represents
the different areas in your life.

17:43.958 --> 17:47.291
Self-awareness,
communication, financial success,

17:47.375 --> 17:49.250
health, and so on.

17:49.333 --> 17:52.041
When a planet enters a specific house,

17:52.125 --> 17:54.833
it brings light
to that area of your chart.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.041
Okay?

17:56.125 --> 17:58.166
-For example…
-Okay.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.666
What's happening with my love house?

18:01.333 --> 18:03.541
Love is in the seventh house,

18:03.625 --> 18:06.625
also known as the house
of wedding and cooperation.

18:06.708 --> 18:07.833
And…

18:07.916 --> 18:09.958
-Are you kidding?
-Why?

18:11.125 --> 18:12.875
It's practically empty!

18:13.875 --> 18:14.708
Well, yes.

18:14.791 --> 18:15.875
It can happen.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.625
It's not so terrible.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.750
Believe me.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.750
My love house is basically
a gigantic black hole

18:23.833 --> 18:26.375
and we're surprised I cannot find a man?

18:26.458 --> 18:28.916
The fact that your seventh house is empty

18:29.000 --> 18:31.708
doesn't mean you'll never find true love.

18:31.791 --> 18:33.541
It simply means in that area

18:33.625 --> 18:35.875
you are free to create
your own happy ending.

18:35.958 --> 18:38.500
Since when do you believe in those?

18:38.583 --> 18:40.416
I've always believed in happy endings.

18:41.208 --> 18:44.208
Just not in traditional ones.

18:44.833 --> 18:45.750
But.

18:47.375 --> 18:48.833
Look at your career house.

18:48.916 --> 18:51.833
There are so many planets,
there's only standing room left.

18:51.916 --> 18:55.208
You have the Sun, Jupiter, Mercury, and…

18:57.375 --> 18:58.250
Oh, Andrea.

19:02.416 --> 19:03.458
Hello.

19:03.541 --> 19:04.708
Apologies for barging in.

19:04.791 --> 19:05.833
Hi, Andrea.

19:05.916 --> 19:06.875
Hi, Tiziano.

19:08.000 --> 19:08.875
Hello, Ms. Bassi.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.083
Alice.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.291
Alice.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.708
-What are you doing here?
-My university is just around the corner.

19:14.791 --> 19:17.416
They make great coffee here

19:17.500 --> 19:19.666
with a very strong flavor.

19:20.666 --> 19:21.833
-Join us.
-Thank you.

19:22.875 --> 19:23.750
A coffee, please.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.458
-Sure.
-Thanks.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.333
I saw the show.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.666
Tiziano sent me the link.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.041
I must say, it's really fun.

19:35.625 --> 19:36.500
Thank you.

19:36.583 --> 19:37.416
Yes.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.791
Even though the girl I picked…

19:40.416 --> 19:41.416
However,

19:41.500 --> 19:42.875
it didn't work out

19:42.958 --> 19:44.583
I'm really sorry.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.666
Did you know that, Tiziano?

19:48.541 --> 19:50.291
It's not the show's fault.

19:50.375 --> 19:51.875
I think I scared her off.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.833
-How?
-Thank you.

19:53.916 --> 19:54.958
Well, I…

19:56.458 --> 19:59.041
I have old-fashioned views
in terms of relationships.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.875
As I was trying to explain to Tiziano,

20:01.958 --> 20:03.666
I'm not looking for any love.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.666
I want love with a capital L.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.166
Real, absolute love.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.333
For the rest of my life.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.083
Whatever.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.458
You two have something in common.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.916
Andrea's seventh house is empty too.

20:27.833 --> 20:28.666
I've gotta go.

20:29.583 --> 20:30.541
The bill, please.

20:30.625 --> 20:32.458
You just had coffee. It's on me.

20:32.541 --> 20:33.416
Thank you.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.041
I'd love to meet up again.

20:37.916 --> 20:39.875
Shall we have dinner, one night?

20:40.375 --> 20:41.541
The three of us?

20:41.625 --> 20:43.375
-Yes, why not?
-Sure.

20:43.458 --> 20:44.791
How about Saturday?

20:45.708 --> 20:46.666
Saturday it is.

20:48.250 --> 20:49.083
Alice.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.750
Andrea.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.166
Tiziano.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.333
Dr. Magni.

20:53.416 --> 20:54.666
-Bye.
-Bye.

21:01.750 --> 21:02.666
Tiziano.

21:02.750 --> 21:03.875
A dinner for three.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.625
Yes, Mom. I'm on my way.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.833
-Good morning.
-Hi, darling.

21:13.916 --> 21:15.041
-Hi.
-Come in.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.166
Ada, how lovely to see you.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.375
Look at your nails.

21:19.875 --> 21:20.708
Spectacular.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.333
Thank you.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.250
You look stunning.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.125
Have you changed your hair?

21:26.208 --> 21:28.166
At last, someone notices.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.625
-True.
-I'll take your coat.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.000
Please, come in.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.208
Please go to that table there.

21:34.458 --> 21:35.750
-Alice?
-Yes?

21:35.833 --> 21:36.750
Manicure for you?

21:36.833 --> 21:37.791
No, thank you.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.541
-I'll wait there, Mom.
-Why not?

21:39.625 --> 21:41.208
You have a date.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.708
It's not a date. There's three of us.

21:43.791 --> 21:45.166
Well, you're going out.

21:45.250 --> 21:48.250
You can't go with hands like that.

21:49.333 --> 21:53.208
Towards the end, with Carlo,
you did let yourself go.

21:53.291 --> 21:54.458
<i>Here we go.</i>

21:54.541 --> 21:56.208
<i>Stay calm, Alice.</i>

21:56.291 --> 21:57.583
And since then,

21:57.666 --> 21:59.583
you've dated a bunch of weirdos.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.291
Who was the last one?

22:03.333 --> 22:04.875
-Alejandro.
-No.

22:04.958 --> 22:07.666
That young one I danced the tango with.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.750
-Tio.
-Tio, yes.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.291
Funny guy.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.500
But sadly gay.

22:12.583 --> 22:13.916
He's not gay, Mom.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.208
He's gender fluid.

22:18.625 --> 22:21.250
And tonight
she's seeing an anthropologist.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.458
A geologist.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.916
Well, a very smart guy.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.083
What do you mean?

22:26.166 --> 22:28.583
Am I not smart enough?

22:28.666 --> 22:31.458
No, I meant to say

22:31.541 --> 22:35.666
that you've particularly
never liked nerds.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.708
You're oddly picky.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.333
<i>Yes, Mother.</i> <i>I love you too.</i>

22:41.833 --> 22:44.416
Yes, I know. I'll be as quick as I can,

22:44.500 --> 22:46.875
but I have a small technical issue.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.791
Don't leave me alone with him.

22:48.875 --> 22:49.875
<i>Sure.</i>

22:49.958 --> 22:52.541
You'll have a good time,
Andrea's such an interesting man.

22:52.625 --> 22:53.500
Hurry up.

22:53.583 --> 22:54.416
<i>Bye.</i>

22:56.666 --> 22:57.541
Yes, bye.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.041
Grandma,

23:03.125 --> 23:04.000
listen up.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.333
Do you remember where you put the keys?

23:07.416 --> 23:08.333
Which keys?

23:13.208 --> 23:14.583
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

23:14.666 --> 23:15.500
Please.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
-Miss?
-Yes?

23:18.583 --> 23:20.333
-Your coat.
-Yes.

23:21.916 --> 23:23.375
-Thank you.
-You as well.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.083
-Andrea.
-Alice.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.750
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.458
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

23:39.541 --> 23:40.375
Please.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.166
Thank you.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.291
You're welcome.

23:43.375 --> 23:45.250
Wow, what a nice place.

23:45.333 --> 23:46.208
Isn't it?

23:46.833 --> 23:49.750
-Have you been waiting long?
-Not at all.

23:50.791 --> 23:52.250
I love your nails.

23:52.333 --> 23:54.208
They were different, last time.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.583
Yes. Blame my mother.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.916
You should give her credit.

24:00.125 --> 24:00.958
Thank you.

24:06.916 --> 24:09.375
When he told me about his gran,
I didn't believe him.

24:09.958 --> 24:13.625
He doesn't look it at first,
but I think that Tiziano is

24:14.125 --> 24:15.375
a very sensitive guy.

24:15.958 --> 24:17.333
Yes, he really is.

24:17.416 --> 24:19.166
And he's usually punctual.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.291
It's not like him to be so late.

24:21.875 --> 24:23.416
<i>Could it be deliberate?</i>

24:25.708 --> 24:27.333
<i>Well, he is cute.</i>

24:28.416 --> 24:30.583
<i>You always liked curly hair.</i>

24:41.250 --> 24:42.666
<i>Christ.</i>

24:42.750 --> 24:43.583
<i>What is that?</i>

24:44.791 --> 24:46.500
Have you known Tiziano long?

24:47.166 --> 24:48.000
No.

24:48.583 --> 24:50.541
We only met a few months ago.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.125
I see, so you are…

24:55.041 --> 24:56.125
seeing each other?

24:56.208 --> 24:57.875
No, not in that way.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.083
No, I mean…

24:59.166 --> 25:00.708
We know each other.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.916
That's all.

25:03.625 --> 25:06.083
<i>Is he trying to establish if I'm single?</i>

25:16.250 --> 25:17.291
<i>Damn!</i>

25:17.375 --> 25:18.833
Have you decided?

25:18.916 --> 25:19.750
Yes.

25:19.833 --> 25:23.291
The lady will have…

25:23.375 --> 25:24.708
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

25:26.416 --> 25:29.666
It's a science that studies
solid, liquid, and gas matter,

25:29.750 --> 25:31.708
that makes up the Earth
and all the planets.

25:31.791 --> 25:35.000
Not to mention the fascinating
evolution of tectonic plates

25:35.083 --> 25:36.375
and their sliding.

25:44.666 --> 25:45.625
<i>Gosh, that hair.</i>

25:45.708 --> 25:48.666
They are tiny micro-particles

25:48.750 --> 25:50.416
that reflect the light and…

25:58.625 --> 25:59.791
Sorry, I have to go.

26:00.583 --> 26:01.625
Everything okay?

26:01.708 --> 26:03.125
Yes, it's just that…

26:04.041 --> 26:05.708
<i>You're not the man for me.</i>

26:05.791 --> 26:07.041
Gonna use the restroom.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.875
I know what you're trying to do, Tiziano.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.458
But even if our seventh houses are empty

26:31.541 --> 26:34.458
and we share the same
romantic view of love,

26:34.958 --> 26:37.875
I have never been so bored
in my entire life.

26:37.958 --> 26:40.250
Either you show up within five minutes

26:40.333 --> 26:43.416
or I will never talk to you again
till death do us part.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.000
-Good evening.
-Here you are.

26:46.666 --> 26:47.583
I'm sorry.

26:47.666 --> 26:50.166
-You look stunning.
-You're not so bad.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.625
My gran misplaced the keys.

26:52.708 --> 26:54.333
It was a nightmare.

26:54.833 --> 26:56.375
But I'm ready.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.541
We're sitting over there.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.041
-Shall we?
-No.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.083
I'm sorry, but…

27:01.166 --> 27:02.791
I can't go back there.

27:02.875 --> 27:03.708
Why?

27:04.291 --> 27:06.666
Listen to the voicemail I just left you.

27:07.958 --> 27:11.166
I'm so grateful
for what you're trying to do,

27:11.250 --> 27:13.333
but I'm done for tonight.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.041
I will go have a nice walk.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.000
No, you can't.

27:17.083 --> 27:18.875
What would I tell him?

27:18.958 --> 27:20.333
Whatever you want.

27:20.416 --> 27:21.750
He will barely notice.

27:21.833 --> 27:22.958
Go, trust me.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.125
-Thanks.
-Go.

27:29.041 --> 27:30.416
Andrea Magni.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.416
Hi.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.583
Hi. I'm so sorry.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.333
-Are you okay?
-Yes, you?

27:34.416 --> 27:35.250
All good, thanks.

27:35.333 --> 27:36.833
-Please.
-Thank you.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.166
Alice sends her love.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.791
Something came up.

27:40.833 --> 27:41.833
She had to dash.

27:44.458 --> 27:45.583
Goodbye.

27:56.333 --> 28:02.041
