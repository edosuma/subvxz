(PLAYFULLY) I am Groot.
I am Groot.

00:10.374 --> 00:12.915
We only have half the money
for that new ship.

00:12.915 --> 00:15.208
Let's check the bounties
one last time.

00:15.208 --> 00:17.790

It's only bounty hunting.
Nothing personal.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.832
What do you mean
I am morally questionable?

Oh, wait. This creature
gets real testy

00:40.915 --> 00:42.374
if he doesn't sleep
with his stuffed dragon.

00:42.374 --> 00:43.582

00:43.582 --> 00:46.124
It's just bounty hunting.
Nothing personal.
