WEBVTT

00:51.050 --> 00:52.010
<i>I'm sure…</i>

00:53.344 --> 00:54.888
<i>that we feel the same way.</i>

00:56.723 --> 00:57.557
KWON YEO-JU

01:06.524 --> 01:08.276
I don't think I can go today.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.277
How about tomorrow?

01:09.360 --> 01:11.529
Okay. That's fine.

01:13.073 --> 01:13.990
Sorry.

01:31.549 --> 01:36.137
PARK JAE-EON

01:41.476 --> 01:44.187
Jae-eon isn't the dating type.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.648
What do you mean?

01:46.731 --> 01:48.441
He may flirt but never commits.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.818
He just draws the line.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.156
Did he say so himself?
That he never commits?

01:57.033 --> 01:58.201
Na-bi, you know what?

01:58.284 --> 02:01.079
Flowers don't bloom
just for one butterfly.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.039
What are you saying?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.542
Jae-eon is like that flower.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.043
Full of vanity,

02:07.127 --> 02:10.380
a symbol of seductive beauty
that withers once it's plucked.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.923
That's what Jae-eon is.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.842
What's with you?

02:13.925 --> 02:15.718
I know we're an art major, but still.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.262
You may not know it,

02:17.345 --> 02:19.848
but his every move is calculated.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.015
Well…

02:21.516 --> 02:23.852
I sometimes felt that something was off,

02:24.894 --> 02:26.354
but it's not like that.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.524
That's how everyone
falls for his tricks or not.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.235
Actually, everyone knows.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.862
They say they won't get fooled,

02:33.945 --> 02:36.364
but they do when he shows
an ounce of sincerity.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.908
Because they want to believe it.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.078
I'm telling you.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.414
Park Jae-eon?
He has no interest at all in dating.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.667
He just likes to play with girls
who are drawn to him.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.419
So forget him.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.629
You don't know how to keep things casual.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.383
What are you on about? We're just friends.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.801
Stop lying to yourself.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.845
Men and women can't be just friends.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.847
Says the one with tons of guy friends.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.558
I keep them close
since there's a possibility.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.519
Hanging out with guys
heightens sexual tension.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.062
Even Jae-eon?

03:08.146 --> 03:10.607
He's not bad to hang out with.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.192
And he's totally handsome.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.028
Is it good?

03:15.111 --> 03:16.988
You're actually eating cafeteria food?

03:17.071 --> 03:18.448
I suggested eating here.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.365
Right.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.783
I'll get some water.

03:20.867 --> 03:21.951
Okay.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.955
What is it? Are you sick?

03:27.415 --> 03:30.168
Well, I…

03:30.752 --> 03:32.503
I just bit my tongue.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.881
Are you all right?

03:34.964 --> 03:37.508
Yes. I'm okay.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.387
I'll be off first. Enjoy your food.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.847
Where are you going?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.313
You didn't forget, right?

03:51.606 --> 03:53.816
-What?
-I'm using my wish.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.402
You already used your wish.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.363
Aren't you granting me another one?

04:00.198 --> 04:01.366
Fine, but nothing weird.

04:16.130 --> 04:20.593
EPISODE 2: IT'S NOT ONLY ME.
NEVERTHELESS,

05:00.133 --> 05:01.259
Dance.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.719
No.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.720
That's my wish.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.431
Can't we just leave?

05:06.514 --> 05:07.765
Let's hang out here.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.436
I can't hear anything. It's too loud.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.858
What are you doing?

05:24.699 --> 05:28.328
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me feel excited.</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:54.312
<i>All I see is Jae-eon.</i>

06:25.885 --> 06:28.721
<i>Are you feeling the same way?</i>

06:52.620 --> 06:53.621
Sorry.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.875
Let's go.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.635
What?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.512
Why am I so red?

07:44.422 --> 07:45.715
<i>I'm smoking outside.</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:48.468
Can I see your ID?

07:48.551 --> 07:49.510
Thank you.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.181
Jae-eon.

08:00.062 --> 08:03.024
You weren't reading my messages.
Were you hanging out here?

08:03.774 --> 08:04.817
Are you alone?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.653
Se-mi and Mi-so are inside.
Want to join us?

08:18.664 --> 08:19.749
I'm with her.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.502
You can hang out without me.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.675
Come on, we can all hang out together.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.844
We can call other guys, too.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.762
<i>Jae-eon…</i>

08:34.430 --> 08:35.890
<i>makes me feel anxious.</i>

08:36.557 --> 08:37.767
Well…

08:37.850 --> 08:38.768
I'm fine.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.605
You can go hang out with her.
I'll head home first.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.857
Why would you leave?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.654
Why don't you just go?

08:49.737 --> 08:50.613
All right, then.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.782
Bye.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.338
Why did you try to ditch me?

09:08.172 --> 09:09.340
You made me feel awkward.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.717
You two seemed close.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.762
I thought you should hang out with her.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.056
We're not close.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.643
We went to the same academy, is all.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.061
<i>We can all hang out together.</i>

09:22.144 --> 09:23.688
We can call other guys, too.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.359
Is that all?

09:29.527 --> 09:32.446
She looked pissed when you told her to go.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.699
Did she?

09:35.366 --> 09:38.536
<i>Right. Maybe it's not a big deal for you.</i>

09:38.619 --> 09:40.371
She had a butterfly

09:41.914 --> 09:43.040
on her wrist, too.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.378
I'm not sure
if it was a drawing or a tattoo.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.841
She just got it by herself.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.009
By herself?

09:54.635 --> 09:55.553
Why?

09:56.095 --> 09:58.431
Maybe she wanted to see my reaction.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.226
You know how friends from academies
sometimes hang out together.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.855
But she kind of obsessed over me.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.149
She was delusional.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.739
Why are you suddenly so serious?

10:15.323 --> 10:16.824
It has nothing to do with you,

10:18.034 --> 10:19.160
so don't worry about it.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.416
I'm taking the bus over there.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.335
You're really going?

10:27.418 --> 10:28.252
Yes.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.171
I'm a bit tired.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.427
I'll take you home. It's late.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.888
No, there's no need.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.514
Bye.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.753
Is he just keeping me on the hook?

11:17.802 --> 11:19.553
What's with him?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.614
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.825
Hey, you're…

11:40.908 --> 11:41.909
Stay still, will you?

11:41.992 --> 11:44.036
-Put your hands like this.
-How did you enter this department?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.496
So I can see all your fingers.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.664
Like this?

11:46.747 --> 11:48.207
No, cross them like this.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.333
Like this?

11:49.417 --> 11:51.460
Yes. That's it.

11:52.711 --> 11:53.754
Where should I look?

11:53.838 --> 11:54.713
Just look at me.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.132
-Seriously?
-Hey, what are you doing?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.174
What?

11:57.758 --> 11:58.676
Focus here.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.136
You sure don't know
how to compliment others.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.262
Put your arms down.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.346
You should work out. Look at that.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.431
Lose some weight.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.682
But Sol.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.310
Your eyes, nose, and mouth
are all so pretty.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.229
Even the shape of your face.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.064
And your eyebrows are pretty.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.732
I'm so jealous.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.568
What should we eat for lunch?

12:16.152 --> 12:17.778
How did you hurt yourself again?

12:17.862 --> 12:19.238
Did you tell me earlier?

12:19.321 --> 12:22.616
Gosh, why are you always randomly
jumping from topic to topic?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.076
No, I'm not.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.495
To me, there's always a flow.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.956
Make that posture again.

12:29.039 --> 12:29.957
Oh, what was it?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.501
Just like before. Hurry up.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.212
How was the blind date yesterday?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.714
It was fine.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.466
I think I'll meet him again.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.634
We have a similar taste in films.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.804
So we decided to watch one together
next time.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.847
That's great.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.973
Hey, be careful.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.933
-Just do it.
-So what happened to your forehead?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.018
Oh, my forehead?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.352
Yes, that's nice.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.687
Like this?

12:51.770 --> 12:52.938
Yes, just a little more.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.148
-More?
-Yes.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.232
Gosh.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.319
-Like this?
-Yes, that's it.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.778
Like this?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.197
Yes.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.531
Hurry up, then.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.408
It's looking great.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.204
Hey, Bit-na. This is my limit. Hurry up.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.623
Just a few more shots.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.750
What are you trying to make?

13:12.833 --> 13:14.376
-Raise your legs more.
-I'm falling.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.338
-Just a bit more.
-I'm falling, okay? I'm falling.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.714
Just a bit… Hey!

13:18.797 --> 13:19.798
Na-bi.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.220
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.933
<i>Right. I'm going to draw the line.</i>

13:29.433 --> 13:30.392
Yes, I'm fine.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.521
What's up? I'm busy right now.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.316
I just came to see you.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.901
<i>I don't want to be a fool again.</i>

13:39.860 --> 13:41.195
You didn't read my messages.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.448
Did you send me messages?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.658
I didn't see them.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.077
Are you busy?

13:49.578 --> 13:50.788
Don't you have time to eat?

13:53.123 --> 13:56.502
I guess I should eat.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.220
<i>But…</i>

14:06.303 --> 14:07.471
Then let's eat together.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.058
Sure, whatever.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.060
Let's go.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.692
WHERE ARE YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO EAT LUNCH?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.694
<i>What are you doing? Are you sleeping?</i>

14:24.864 --> 14:26.699
<i>I'm sure he does this to everyone.</i>

14:27.658 --> 14:28.742
<i>He's so frivolous.</i>

14:29.702 --> 14:30.828
<i>Where are you?</i>

14:41.630 --> 14:42.590
<i>Home.</i>

14:45.384 --> 14:46.552
PARK JAE-EON

15:02.443 --> 15:03.277
Hello?

15:04.194 --> 15:05.487
What are you doing?

15:05.571 --> 15:06.822
<i>Nothing much.</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:08.282
Why did you call?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.118
I just wanted

15:11.201 --> 15:12.411
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

15:12.494 --> 15:14.079
You're ridiculous.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.456
You always say that.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.708
You always say I'm funny, too.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.878
I really mean it, though.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.255
Jeez.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.134
Don't be ridiculous.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.678
<i>I know everything.</i>

15:52.242 --> 15:53.243
Jae-eon.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.037
Thank you so much.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.872
It's nothing.

15:58.749 --> 15:59.792
Jae-eon.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.086
Would you like to work with me?

16:03.170 --> 16:04.171
Oh, thank you.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.469
We need new part-timers
at our department office.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.971
Just for this semester.

16:12.054 --> 16:12.930
Well, I…

16:13.013 --> 16:15.391
Come on. Just think about it.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.894
We need two people.
Min-yeong's luring Na-bi in,

16:19.687 --> 16:22.314
and I want to lure you.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.441
I'll think about it.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.862
Just a little more work. Thanks.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.823
Right. I'll finish up here.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.491
-I'll throw that away.
-Thanks.

16:32.574 --> 16:33.492
Good luck.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.743
Okay.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.503
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.006
Hey, Jae-eon! Did you have lunch?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.883
We're going out to eat. Want to join us?

16:50.384 --> 16:53.262
No, I have plans. Enjoy your lunch.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.390
He always says he has plans.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.433
Let's go.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.330
Who is it?

17:25.878 --> 17:26.920
Jae-eon?

17:28.672 --> 17:30.424
What are you doing?

19:25.581 --> 19:26.582
PARK JAE-EON

19:41.221 --> 19:42.598
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

19:43.182 --> 19:44.892
<i>I had a racy dream.</i>

19:47.811 --> 19:48.896
MISSED CALL
PARK JAE-EON

19:49.479 --> 19:50.439
What?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.609
Darn it. I'm late.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.569
Darn it…

20:12.669 --> 20:14.004
Darn it.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.839
<i>Why did it have to be Jae-eon?</i>

20:16.465 --> 20:17.382
<i>And in my house?</i>

20:17.466 --> 20:18.675
Seriously…

20:33.482 --> 20:34.566
-Hello, sir.
-Yes?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.693
I'm Yu Na-bi from Sculpture.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.445
-Oh, the morning class.
-Yes.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.155
-You had a presentation to do.
-Yes.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.865
Well, I…

20:41.949 --> 20:44.284
I kind of overslept today.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.579
Could I do the presentation
for this class instead?

20:50.165 --> 20:52.334
Since you seemed to have rushed here.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.503
You'll get some points off, though.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.755
All right. Thank you.

20:56.838 --> 20:57.673
Okay.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.650
Darn it.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.487
<i>Where are you?</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:23.824
I'm sure Bit-na is taking this class.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.170
He called me,
but he didn't read my messages?

21:37.254 --> 21:39.047
Whatever.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.306
Na-bi.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.392
Do you take this class too?
Why have I never seen you?

21:51.226 --> 21:52.477
Oh, well…

21:53.145 --> 21:54.938
I usually take the morning class.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.481
I'm only taking this today.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.358
I overslept.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.457
Are you with someone?

22:19.463 --> 22:21.965
I asked Jae-eon to think about
taking the part-time job.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.177
What about Na-bi? Is she in?

22:25.260 --> 22:26.678
I don't know yet.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.473
She said she probably can't do it, though.

22:30.974 --> 22:31.933
Really?

22:32.642 --> 22:35.353
Then I told Jae-eon something
I shouldn't have.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.606
I'll just keep quiet for now.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.902
Hello, it's Seong-yun.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.028
Hey.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.490
Mr. An.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.910
I came for my package.

22:49.993 --> 22:50.952
Oh, okay.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.539
My goodness. Thank you.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.460
Mr. An. I brought you a dessert.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.212
Hey, you shouldn't have.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.505
It's fine.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.256
Take it.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.051
-I appreciate it.
-Are you kidding me?

23:06.134 --> 23:07.761
Is this the post office or what?

23:07.844 --> 23:12.057
The pudding was expensive,
so I could only get one.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.266
I'm really sorry.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.643
Bye, then.

23:16.853 --> 23:17.854
Gyeong-jun.

23:18.396 --> 23:21.650
Receiving packages for the kids
is going too far, don't you think?

23:21.733 --> 23:23.735
It's nothing difficult.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.071
You know what it's like.

23:26.154 --> 23:29.574
It's tough trying to receive packages
without your parents finding out.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.828
It's a huge mess!

23:32.911 --> 23:34.579
Should I tell our professor?

23:39.376 --> 23:40.210
Hello.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.670
Hey, Sol.

23:41.753 --> 23:45.549
Have you still not decided on your school?
The professor always asks me that.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.051
No, I haven't yet.

23:50.929 --> 23:55.142
Our professor would obviously
want you to go to an elite university,

23:56.309 --> 23:59.271
but you should choose the one
you really want to go to.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.399
All right. I will. Thanks.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.775
No problem.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.485
-You can talk to me anytime.
-Okay.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.321
Is this a counseling room now?

24:15.745 --> 24:17.289
Did you order a package?

24:17.372 --> 24:18.748
It could be the delivery guy.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.834
-Take the call.
-For God's sake.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.627
All right.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.089
Hello?

24:27.257 --> 24:29.259
<i>Hello. This is Jung Ju-hyeok.</i>

24:29.342 --> 24:30.802
What? Who?

24:31.720 --> 24:34.848
<i>Oh, you asked me to call you.
We met at the cafe.</i>

24:39.227 --> 24:40.061
I'm so sorry.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.647
I'm okay. Are you all right?

24:44.316 --> 24:48.111
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

24:48.195 --> 24:51.489
If you tell me your bank account
and price, I'll send you the money.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.950
Well…

24:54.743 --> 24:57.370
If you're free, could we meet up?

24:58.121 --> 25:00.332
What? In person?

25:04.211 --> 25:05.462
Hang on.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.340
-Bye.
-Bye.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.512
He's obviously trying to hit on her.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.307
Stop being so nosy.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.226
Gosh.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.937
Romance is in the air now.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.939
How adorable.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.565
As you can see now,

25:26.316 --> 25:31.446
sometimes a character looks directly
at the camera.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.865
The audience watching the film

25:33.949 --> 25:37.118
would feel like they've locked eyes
with the actor

25:37.202 --> 25:38.787
-and be startled.
-Wake up.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.749
We call this
the "Tension to Camera" method.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.669
-The character points a gun
-What's wrong?

25:45.752 --> 25:47.504
-at the camera
-Are you sick?

25:47.587 --> 25:49.214
or throws a punch…

25:49.297 --> 25:52.384
<i>Why are bad hunches never wrong?</i>

25:52.467 --> 25:55.971
Then the camera shakes.
This is another example of that.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.222
I'll get it.

25:57.305 --> 26:00.600
-No, let me…
-No, I'm the one who dropped it.

26:00.684 --> 26:01.768
I'll get it.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.773
Director François Truffaut.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.192
I'm sure you would've
heard his name before.

26:09.276 --> 26:13.530
In the last scene
of the film <i>The 400 Blows</i>,

26:14.239 --> 26:17.242
the boy escapes from the juvenile center
and runs toward the ocean.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.286
<i>I have rotten luck,</i>

26:19.786 --> 26:22.038
-<i>and a zit pops up on my chin.</i>
-And he looks directly…

26:22.664 --> 26:25.542
-<i>It's that day of the month.</i>
-Back then, it was taboo for actors…

26:25.625 --> 26:28.169
ARE YOU COMING?
CAN YOU GET ME A PAD ON YOUR WAY?

26:28.253 --> 26:29.921
Come on, go easy on me.

26:30.005 --> 26:30.880
All right.

26:30.964 --> 26:31.965
Gosh, seriously!

26:32.507 --> 26:34.009
Darn it.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.435
My stomach still hurts.

26:45.812 --> 26:46.646
Drink that.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.197
I feel a little better now.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.367
Hey!

26:59.951 --> 27:02.537
Gosh, you're going backward.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.873
Let's take a short break.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.131
-Jae-eon! Aren't you going for a smoke?
-Go ahead first.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.799
Do you want to come?

27:16.843 --> 27:19.596
I have to prepare for my presentation.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.181
Oh, you're presenting today?

27:21.264 --> 27:22.891
I should really focus

27:23.516 --> 27:25.185
and clap really loudly.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.979
Go ahead.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.397
What?

27:30.398 --> 27:32.734
Well, your friends are leaving.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.486
Go catch up with them.

27:35.528 --> 27:36.488
Okay.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.700
You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.672
I didn't…

27:56.091 --> 27:57.425
Let's go.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.057
What a relief.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.858
Gosh, what is this?

28:15.402 --> 28:17.612
I got totally fooled by this.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.450
<i>You sometimes</i>

28:23.159 --> 28:24.702
suddenly act cold to me.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.788
Gosh, it's really bothering me.

28:29.707 --> 28:32.377
Hello, I'm Sculpture major, Yu Na-bi.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.386
Well…

28:44.931 --> 28:47.559
The film I'm presenting today

28:47.642 --> 28:51.271
is known
as the first science fiction film…

28:54.733 --> 28:56.151
<i>Code red alert.</i>

28:56.693 --> 28:58.486
<i>It's for real this time.</i>

28:59.320 --> 29:00.530
It's…

29:07.245 --> 29:08.913
<i>A Trip to the Moon.</i>

29:09.789 --> 29:12.083
Director Georges Méliès
was also a magician.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.127
<i>"Everyone, having your period</i>

29:14.210 --> 29:17.422
-<i>is nothing to be ashamed of."</i>
-He was praised for his filming methods.

29:17.505 --> 29:20.592
-<i>Yes. That's right.</i>
-Most of all…

29:21.468 --> 29:24.304
At the time, films were not much different
from theater stages.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.681
The director made a unique mise-en-scène

29:26.765 --> 29:29.058
that was different
from reality or theater stages

29:29.142 --> 29:31.102
by applying perspective,
space, distortion--

29:31.186 --> 29:32.479
Wait.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.648
You're talking too fast.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.817
Slow down and speak clearly.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.571
Okay. Well…

29:42.280 --> 29:43.364
<i>But periods are…</i>

29:44.657 --> 29:45.658
<i>disasters.</i>

29:47.243 --> 29:49.829
Hello, I'm Fashion Design major,
Kim Yeong-min.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.084
<i>Disaster victims must evacuate</i>

29:55.168 --> 29:58.004
-<i>to a safe zone.</i>
-It is about Nosferatu.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.381
This film is actually an adaptation

30:00.965 --> 30:03.134
of the novel <i>Dracula</i> by Bram Stoker.

30:03.676 --> 30:06.137
He changed the character's names
and some details

30:06.221 --> 30:09.974
to avoid copyright issues
when he made the film.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.270
Yu Na-bi!

30:19.192 --> 30:20.777
Did I do something…

30:39.921 --> 30:42.757
What are you doing?
You said you have a night class.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.217
You'll get cold later.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.095
Should I take it back?

30:50.515 --> 30:52.100
But still, it could get on your--

30:52.183 --> 30:53.309
It's fine.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.855
<i>I feel like crying.</i>

30:56.938 --> 30:58.314
<i>Why did it have to be Jae-eon?</i>

30:58.398 --> 30:59.649
Will you tell…

31:03.111 --> 31:04.362
other people?

31:07.365 --> 31:09.576
Is that what you think of me?

31:10.910 --> 31:13.079
Then if you saw me

31:14.038 --> 31:16.249
suddenly getting a boner during class,

31:17.166 --> 31:18.626
would you tell the others?

31:19.502 --> 31:21.004
That's different, though.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.422
It's not the same,

31:23.840 --> 31:24.966
but would you?

31:27.176 --> 31:28.553
Of course not.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.223
Really?

31:33.850 --> 31:34.934
Of course.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.271
Then I won't, either.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.109
<i>Would someone like him</i>

31:44.652 --> 31:46.362
<i>really be considered frivolous?</i>

32:07.634 --> 32:14.307
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.
I WILL GET YOUR CLOTHES…

32:26.444 --> 32:27.654
<i>Did you get home okay?</i>

32:30.239 --> 32:32.951
<i>Do people act like this
to keep someone on the hook?</i>

32:33.576 --> 32:35.912
<i>You read my message right away.
What are you doing?</i>

32:44.295 --> 32:47.924
LAUNDROMAT

32:48.758 --> 32:51.177
We're going to play basketball
and go out for drinks.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.929
You should join us.

32:53.012 --> 32:54.639
Next time. I have plans.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.433
But weren't you wearing a shirt over that?

32:58.101 --> 32:59.268
Where did you put it?

32:59.352 --> 33:00.937
I lent it to my friend.

33:01.020 --> 33:01.980
Friend?

33:02.063 --> 33:03.982
Who was that pretty girl a while ago?

33:04.565 --> 33:05.566
Are you two close?

33:06.275 --> 33:07.276
Did we seem close?

33:14.909 --> 33:16.202
<i>I'm buying art supplies.</i>

33:16.744 --> 33:18.037
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

33:20.915 --> 33:22.959
You said you're just friends.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.505
Gosh. We are just friends.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.842
We did get a bit close, though.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.220
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

33:34.303 --> 33:35.596
Don't change the subject.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.307
Is there something going on?

33:39.517 --> 33:41.144
It's not like that.

33:42.812 --> 33:43.896
I'm just…

33:44.564 --> 33:46.441
not pushing away someone

33:46.983 --> 33:49.444
who's being nice to me.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.114
You're really getting your hopes up.

33:53.990 --> 33:57.744
So you're saying he's treating you
like someone special.

33:57.827 --> 33:58.828
Well…

33:59.912 --> 34:01.414
Maybe.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.625
From what I've seen so far,

34:05.668 --> 34:07.920
the things that made you feel special

34:08.004 --> 34:09.714
might be meaningless to him.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.925
I told you, he's nice to everyone

34:13.009 --> 34:14.594
without any exception.

34:17.555 --> 34:18.598
I don't know.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.476
Maybe.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.023
She has to realize it herself.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.567
Don't blame me later for not warning you!

34:35.406 --> 34:36.949
Are you free tomorrow?

34:37.033 --> 34:39.702
-Don't you have a gathering?
-Jae-eon told you?

34:40.286 --> 34:41.829
I guess you two did grow close.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.457
Did you hear who's coming?

34:45.124 --> 34:46.167
No.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.545
You should come.
All persons of interest are coming.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.049
"Persons of interest?"

34:54.050 --> 34:55.218
It's going to be fun.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.221
And shouldn't you check for yourself?

34:59.931 --> 35:00.765
What?

35:00.848 --> 35:03.559
Whether you're really special
to Jae-eon or not.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.536
"Navi bobo"?

35:21.619 --> 35:22.870
NAVI_BOBO: I LIKE YOUR NEW HAIR

35:27.542 --> 35:30.419
2,432 FOLLOWERS

35:36.676 --> 35:38.511
All of them are girls.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.305
2,432 FOLLOWERS

35:48.855 --> 35:50.648
<i>I want my heart to keep fluttering,</i>

35:52.233 --> 35:54.026
<i>but I keep feeling anxious.</i>

36:04.871 --> 36:07.248
<i>What do I want from Jae-eon?</i>

36:38.946 --> 36:40.114
<i>Right.</i>

36:40.198 --> 36:42.825
<i>I should just check for myself
and forget about him.</i>

36:48.247 --> 36:50.750
<i>Bit-na, I'll join you tomorrow.</i>

36:55.004 --> 36:56.797
Hey, isn't Sol coming today?

36:57.381 --> 36:58.591
She's close to you.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.092
Not really.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.886
She's only close to Ji-wan.

37:01.969 --> 37:05.723
And our department ace would never
eat at the same table as us.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.850
You have lunch with her often.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.393
You're so dramatic.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.729
Don't you know what a metaphor is?

37:12.730 --> 37:14.482
What are you, a kid?

37:14.565 --> 37:15.524
Can't you stay still?

37:16.025 --> 37:17.610
He's always been like that.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.613
You're excited thinking
about Sol, aren't you?

37:20.696 --> 37:22.365
Do you have a crush on her?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.409
She's so quick-witted.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.161
Help me out, then.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.455
Take charge of your own love life.

37:29.538 --> 37:30.957
Yun Sol?

37:32.833 --> 37:33.960
She's pretty.

37:34.043 --> 37:37.129
She's also sassy and extremely skilled.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.215
She's totally my style.

37:40.132 --> 37:42.885
-But does she even like guys?
-What are you on about?

37:42.969 --> 37:44.345
I mean,

37:44.428 --> 37:46.806
I've never seen her hang out with guys.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.683
Have you?

37:48.766 --> 37:51.727
I've never seen Gyu-hyun
hang out with girls, either.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.853
Then is he…

37:54.522 --> 37:55.856
Are you?

37:56.482 --> 37:58.985
-What about me? Am I a guy, then?
-Yes.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.778
-You jerk.
-Wait.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.613
-Let me give you a punch.
-Hey, stop.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.075
What are you guys up to?

38:06.158 --> 38:07.451
You haven't quit yet?

38:08.369 --> 38:09.620
I knew it.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.415
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.709
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.461
Ji-wan.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.672
What's he up to now?

38:22.174 --> 38:23.217
Can I ask you a favor?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.136
A favor? What is it?

38:26.721 --> 38:28.597
We're going out for drinks today.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.308
Come join us with Sol.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.101
Sol? Why?

38:32.601 --> 38:33.894
Please bring her over.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.855
Let him get rejected so he can shut up.

38:36.814 --> 38:37.940
You have a crush on her?

38:38.733 --> 38:39.942
I think I do.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.155
Help me out, okay?

38:44.238 --> 38:47.074
Come on. Help me get close to her.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.200
Okay?

38:48.868 --> 38:50.202
He's serious.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.038
Well, okay. I'll ask her.

38:52.121 --> 38:52.955
Nice.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.666
But she might refuse.
She doesn't enjoy drinking.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.377
I know. I'm pretty sure she won't come.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.046
Okay.

39:00.129 --> 39:03.341
-Let's go.
-You're coming? Really?

39:03.424 --> 39:04.467
Why?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.262
What do you mean? Didn't you want to go?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.722
What?

39:09.805 --> 39:12.600
Oh, right. You're right.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.018
Okay, let's go together.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.020
What's that reaction?

39:20.733 --> 39:22.943
By the way,
what do you think of Yu Se-hun?

39:24.111 --> 39:25.404
What about him?

39:25.488 --> 39:28.282
You're not that interested in him, right?

39:30.159 --> 39:32.703
He seemed pretty funny.

39:33.913 --> 39:34.830
He's funny?

39:35.623 --> 39:36.624
Yes.

39:42.546 --> 39:43.547
Why?

39:43.631 --> 39:44.840
I don't want this.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.387
Se-hun, you look really stylish today.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.724
Hey. This jacket's worth 20 million won.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.976
-Really?
-He's loaded!

39:56.060 --> 39:59.897
-Then buy us a big bowl of stew!
-He could just buy us this place!

40:01.023 --> 40:03.901
-Se-hun!
-Keep it coming!

40:03.984 --> 40:04.985
Hey, Na-bi's here.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.570
-Hi, Na-bi.
-Hi, Na-bi.

40:06.654 --> 40:07.655
-Any empty…
-Let's see.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.156
Go over there.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.201
Na-bi. Come sit over here. Come here.

40:12.284 --> 40:13.619
Go sit there.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.496
Come on.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.415
It's been a while.

40:17.998 --> 40:20.209
You're attending gatherings
since you broke up?

40:20.292 --> 40:22.545
You're finally free of that old dude?

40:22.628 --> 40:24.672
She's free!

40:24.755 --> 40:26.215
What's with you?

40:26.298 --> 40:28.259
Did you break up?

40:28.342 --> 40:29.260
You broke up?

40:29.343 --> 40:31.762
Why are you asking that?

40:33.764 --> 40:35.766
Everyone's here except Jae-eon, right?

40:36.517 --> 40:38.185
He's not reading my message.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.728
He always replies late.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.731
Right. He's always
holding his phone, though.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.735
He just reads the alerts and ignores them.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.196
No, he's not that type.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.533
-Where should he sit?
-We can get a chair here.

40:52.616 --> 40:56.954
<i>"Not the dating type"?
It's like he's dating all the girls.</i>

40:57.037 --> 40:58.456
Jae-eon's really popular.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.962
We should add more chairs.

41:05.045 --> 41:06.464
Sol and Ji-wan are coming, too.

41:06.547 --> 41:07.756
Really?

41:07.840 --> 41:10.301
No way. Sol is coming?

41:10.384 --> 41:13.262
Didn't you hear
that Ji-wan's coming as well?

41:13.345 --> 41:15.723
Hang on. Let me get a chair.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.267
It's nice that you never change.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.769
-Why are you putting that next to you?
-Because I want to.

41:22.813 --> 41:23.981
Aren't you taking it off?

41:25.774 --> 41:26.984
What?

41:29.403 --> 41:31.822
Your jacket. Why are you so startled?

41:32.490 --> 41:33.908
What were you thinking?

41:33.991 --> 41:35.993
You take it off too.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.496
I wasn't thinking of anything.

41:38.579 --> 41:41.165
Take off your jackets, guys. It's hot.

41:41.248 --> 41:43.042
-You take it off.
-Oh, that's my water.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.920
Oh, sorry.

41:46.003 --> 41:48.380
-Is there a new cup anywhere?
-It's fine.

41:49.673 --> 41:52.176
You're my senior, right?

41:53.135 --> 41:56.180
It's nice to meet you.
I'm a freshman. Kim Eun-han.

41:57.890 --> 42:01.268
We ordered some food already.
Have you tried the seafood stew here?

42:01.352 --> 42:03.020
No, I never tried it.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.605
Do you like seafood?

42:04.688 --> 42:06.732
Yes, I do.

42:06.815 --> 42:08.359
That's a relief.

42:08.442 --> 42:12.404
-Hey, go check the order.
-We're selling food at the flea market.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.031
You should come visit our booth.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.991
<i>We killed time with useless conversations,</i>

42:16.075 --> 42:17.535
-<i>but the food wasn't served.</i>
-Please.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.411
Yes, of course.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.746
-<i>When things started to get boring…</i>
-Really?

42:20.829 --> 42:21.664
Yes.

42:21.747 --> 42:23.207
-Did he reply?
-No.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.416
<i>…the main character appeared.</i>

42:24.500 --> 42:25.709
It's Jae-eon!

42:25.793 --> 42:27.336
-Hey!
-Why are you so late?

42:27.419 --> 42:29.129
-Jae-eon!
-Hey! What took you so long?

42:29.213 --> 42:31.048
-Look at the time!
-Don't you see what time it is?

42:31.715 --> 42:33.926
-Your pretty face won't cut it.
-Sit over here.

42:34.009 --> 42:37.096
<i>The sexual tension
rises dramatically at his arrival.</i>

42:37.179 --> 42:38.931
-He should drink for being late!
-Why are you late?

42:39.014 --> 42:40.558
Sorry, there was a bit of traffic.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.603
Na-bi, you're here too.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.230
Yes.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.482
He's here, so let's all drink!

42:48.566 --> 42:49.733
-Let's drink!
-Here we go!

42:49.817 --> 42:53.362
-Let's clink and drink!
-Let's clink and drink!

42:53.445 --> 42:55.489
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.699
Air clink.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.411
This tastes so sweet.

43:00.995 --> 43:02.913
I'm going to drink so much today.

43:02.997 --> 43:04.498
This is spicier than I thought.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.125
-Just eat.
-Here, have some water.

43:06.208 --> 43:08.294
-Where are they going?
-Hey, stop it.

43:08.377 --> 43:09.211
Drink some water.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.338
Thanks.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.424
He's so popular.

43:13.507 --> 43:14.466
It's pretty spicy.

43:14.550 --> 43:17.511
It's so surprising that she came here.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.221
I asked her to join us.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.473
It was that easy?

43:22.850 --> 43:24.059
Gosh, stop it.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.561
-Is it spicy?
-Is it?

43:29.148 --> 43:30.733
Look at you, you're all red.

43:31.859 --> 43:35.362
Aren't girls better at eating spicy food
than guys?

43:35.446 --> 43:37.072
Is that so?

43:37.156 --> 43:39.033
I read somewhere

43:39.575 --> 43:43.078
that women naturally endure pain better
since they have to give birth.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.290
And you know, when it's their first time--

43:46.373 --> 43:47.499
What did you say?

43:48.959 --> 43:50.919
Damn it, I'm losing my appetite.

43:51.003 --> 43:53.672
I should report you.

43:53.756 --> 43:54.673
Stop the nonsense.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.175
Hey.

43:56.258 --> 43:58.260
Why do you always cross the line?

43:58.344 --> 44:00.054
What?

44:00.137 --> 44:02.681
Tasting spiciness
is feeling a sense of pain.

44:02.765 --> 44:04.600
Stop treating me like a pervert.

44:05.809 --> 44:07.686
Just wipe your dirty mouth.

44:08.687 --> 44:11.440
Wow. Sol, you're so cool.

44:11.523 --> 44:12.900
Stop it.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.494
Hey!

44:24.828 --> 44:27.081
Here. Have a drink.

44:27.164 --> 44:28.207
You ruined the vibe!

44:28.290 --> 44:29.667
-What have you done?
-Stop talking!

44:29.750 --> 44:30.876
You want to drink something?

44:30.959 --> 44:32.419
-Exactly!
-Do something.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.545
-Yes!
-Let's bring back the vibe.

44:33.629 --> 44:34.963
-Let's go!
-Should we keep it going?

44:35.047 --> 44:36.882
-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!

44:37.508 --> 44:39.218
-This one.
-Zero, zero, seven!

44:40.636 --> 44:43.013
Lime? Is this good?

44:43.097 --> 44:45.349
I don't know. I think you'll like it.

44:46.642 --> 44:47.768
Me?

44:47.851 --> 44:49.395
You said so at the club.

44:50.062 --> 44:51.438
Here.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.817
Is this lime?

44:54.900 --> 44:55.984
I like lime.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.078
You remember that?

45:17.214 --> 45:18.173
It's strange.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.176
Don't people try smoking out of curiosity?

45:21.260 --> 45:22.594
You tried mine before.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.930
What? When?

45:25.013 --> 45:28.350
You always refused when I offered.

45:28.434 --> 45:30.060
I was just curious.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.354
Forget it. I feel so hurt now.

45:33.105 --> 45:34.565
Na-bi,

45:35.274 --> 45:37.067
you look like you're in a good mood.

45:42.364 --> 45:43.240
What do you mean?

45:43.323 --> 45:46.118
You looked a bit upset
so I thought you weren't feeling well.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.079
I was uncomfortable with too many people.

45:49.663 --> 45:52.124
Right. You're shy with strangers.

45:52.207 --> 45:53.542
Even with me?

45:54.585 --> 45:58.088
You weren't like that before.
You smiled all the time.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.673
I thought you were angry.

45:59.756 --> 46:03.260
Gosh. Why are you showing
so much interest in her today?

46:04.887 --> 46:05.888
What?

46:07.389 --> 46:09.391
Is there something going on
between you two?

46:09.475 --> 46:10.976
It seems like it.

46:11.643 --> 46:13.770
I did think it was strange.

46:13.854 --> 46:14.730
It's…

46:14.813 --> 46:16.190
It's nothing like that.

46:17.149 --> 46:19.109
Don't lie to me.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.986
I can tell by your expressions.
Aren't I right?

46:21.069 --> 46:23.864
What's with you? There's nothing going on.

46:25.157 --> 46:26.200
Right?

46:30.871 --> 46:31.872
Yes.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.790
Right.

46:34.416 --> 46:35.292
No?

46:35.375 --> 46:36.919
That's strange.

46:37.002 --> 46:39.296
Didn't you keep looking at him, Na-bi?

46:40.631 --> 46:41.757
You kept looking at him.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.634
I'm going to the bathroom.

46:43.717 --> 46:46.595
I'll come with you. Damn it.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.100
He doesn't know how you feel,

46:52.184 --> 46:54.228
so he said that in case
it would get awkward.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.063
Forget it.

46:56.146 --> 46:58.065
If that was really the case,

46:58.148 --> 47:02.236
he would've just changed the subject
or said something vague.

47:05.447 --> 47:06.323
Right?

47:06.406 --> 47:09.826
<i>I'm sure he didn't say that just for me.</i>

47:11.161 --> 47:12.621
He just drew the line.

47:12.704 --> 47:14.790
Hey, don't say it like that.

47:14.873 --> 47:17.793
-You're overreacting.
-Didn't you know this would happen?

47:17.876 --> 47:19.086
What's with the pep talk?

47:19.169 --> 47:22.047
Well, I thought maybe
I was being too harsh.

47:22.130 --> 47:24.550
It's not like I can read his mind.

47:24.633 --> 47:27.094
Plus, he kept looking at you.

47:29.096 --> 47:31.348
No way. He was busy chatting with Yun-ji.

47:31.431 --> 47:35.143
No! He kept glancing at you
whenever you spoke.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.312
And most importantly,

47:40.566 --> 47:42.526
he doesn't do stuff like this.

47:46.947 --> 47:50.158
Bit-na, this is just a 3,000 won drink.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.536
Anyway, this is different.

47:52.619 --> 47:56.039
Honestly, I wasn't sure
when I heard your side of the story,

47:56.123 --> 47:58.834
but seeing it in person,
I can sense something.

48:04.506 --> 48:05.924
Are you going to stay?

48:06.008 --> 48:07.593
No. I want to go home.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.345
Let's go to your place with Jae-eon.

48:10.429 --> 48:12.806
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

48:12.889 --> 48:14.308
I'll come with you!

48:14.391 --> 48:16.310
We can't waste an opportunity like this.

48:17.894 --> 48:19.146
But still…

48:20.772 --> 48:23.358
Forget it. I'm going to go home.

48:23.442 --> 48:24.610
I don't feel like it.

48:25.819 --> 48:27.154
Let's at least ask him.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.322
Goodness.

48:29.406 --> 48:31.199
There's really nothing going on
between you two?

48:31.783 --> 48:33.869
I know. You said you don't date.

48:34.536 --> 48:37.289
It seems like she's hitting on you
without knowing that.

48:37.956 --> 48:41.084
She was acting like she's all that
because she's a bit pretty.

48:41.168 --> 48:42.794
Serves her right.

48:42.878 --> 48:46.548
Min-sang, don't say stuff about people
you can't say to their faces.

48:46.632 --> 48:48.091
-What?
-You're badmouthing her

48:48.175 --> 48:49.676
just because you can't have her.

48:50.302 --> 48:51.386
It's pathetic.

48:51.470 --> 48:52.846
What did you just say?

48:52.929 --> 48:54.598
I'm telling you to watch your mouth.

48:57.476 --> 49:01.438
You asshole. You just said there was
nothing going on between you and Na-bi.

49:02.564 --> 49:04.566
-Hey, where were you?
-<i>Pajeon</i> must be out.

49:04.650 --> 49:06.485
Come on, or I'll eat everything.

49:06.568 --> 49:07.986
Yes, I'm coming.

49:10.447 --> 49:11.990
Let's go eat.

49:15.077 --> 49:18.455
<i>Jae-eon seems totally unbothered.</i>

49:22.501 --> 49:23.585
Don't worry about him.

49:24.169 --> 49:27.631
-What?
-He goes around talking about me, too.

49:29.716 --> 49:30.634
Like what?

49:31.677 --> 49:32.928
That you don't date?

49:34.680 --> 49:38.308
Do people have to date?

49:40.227 --> 49:41.645
Not necessarily.

49:42.312 --> 49:43.480
Right?

49:45.273 --> 49:48.235
I have a friend who doesn't date either.

49:48.318 --> 49:51.863
But unlike you, he's a bit cold.

49:51.947 --> 49:52.864
Especially to girls.

49:54.366 --> 49:55.909
Why can't two people

49:56.743 --> 49:58.495
just be close?

49:59.788 --> 50:01.540
Can't they look at each other

50:02.374 --> 50:04.084
or stand near each other?

50:12.259 --> 50:13.885
Do they have to pretend not to notice

50:14.886 --> 50:16.555
if there's something in their hair?

50:21.184 --> 50:22.394
That's not what I mean.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.438
Right?

50:25.230 --> 50:26.773
It's nice to get along well.

50:30.068 --> 50:31.653
<i>"Is that really all?"</i>

50:32.362 --> 50:34.364
<i>But I didn't ask him that.</i>

50:34.448 --> 50:36.158
Who wants to go for another round?

50:36.742 --> 50:38.702
Me!

50:38.785 --> 50:40.203
-Just go home.
-You go!

50:40.287 --> 50:41.496
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

50:41.580 --> 50:43.582
Are you going?

50:43.665 --> 50:45.459
-Well…
-Jae-eon, are you going?

50:46.793 --> 50:48.170
Well, if everyone's going…

50:48.253 --> 50:49.963
I have other plans.

50:50.046 --> 50:52.132
What? Is it important?

50:52.215 --> 50:53.425
It's just a friend.

50:54.676 --> 50:58.263
<i>Today seems like a perfect day
to get rid of my feelings.</i>

51:05.228 --> 51:06.271
What is it?

51:06.354 --> 51:10.066
I'm wondering if I should
see my friend or join the others.

51:10.150 --> 51:11.359
What about you?

51:14.571 --> 51:15.572
<i>But I…</i>

51:17.032 --> 51:18.992
Well…

51:20.118 --> 51:22.120
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house.

51:22.204 --> 51:23.205
Do you want to come?

51:27.667 --> 51:29.044
<i>I give up that chance</i>

51:29.628 --> 51:31.546
<i>and decide to become a fun girl.</i>

51:32.297 --> 51:33.882
<i>National!</i>

51:33.965 --> 51:35.967
-Singing Contest!
-Singing Contest!

51:40.388 --> 51:41.932
All right. "Love."

51:42.015 --> 51:43.308
-"Love"?
-"Love."

51:43.391 --> 51:44.643
<i>I've fallen in love</i>

51:44.726 --> 51:47.604
<i>-I've fallen in love
-I've fallen in love</i>

51:47.687 --> 51:50.440
<i>Love, love, love, my love</i>

51:50.524 --> 51:51.900
You don't know?

51:51.983 --> 51:54.778
<i>Come here, my love</i>

51:54.861 --> 51:57.280
-You don't know this?
-Keep going. What's wrong?

51:57.364 --> 51:58.949
We won't accept that. Drink up.

51:59.032 --> 52:00.867
-Drink.
-But I…

52:00.951 --> 52:04.412
-Drink up.
-I'll drink it for you.

52:05.539 --> 52:06.373
What was that?

52:06.456 --> 52:07.332
All right.

52:07.415 --> 52:09.251
<i>Keep it going</i>

52:09.334 --> 52:10.710
<i>-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!</i>

52:10.794 --> 52:12.420
Let's do the Alphabet Game.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.631
-"L"!
-"L"?

52:15.757 --> 52:16.967
Lion.

52:17.676 --> 52:18.510
Leaf.

52:18.593 --> 52:19.594
I got it. Lie!

52:20.178 --> 52:21.012
Love.

52:23.014 --> 52:24.349
Oh, me! Left!

52:24.850 --> 52:25.851
Life.

52:25.934 --> 52:27.269
Long.

52:27.352 --> 52:28.395
Gosh, what do I do?

52:28.478 --> 52:29.855
-Only the two of you left.
-Wait. Let me think.

52:29.938 --> 52:31.022
What do I do?

52:32.524 --> 52:34.401
I know! Lust!

52:35.110 --> 52:38.238
-Oh, come on!
-What? It starts with "L"!

52:38.321 --> 52:39.573
Yes, you're right. Fine.

52:39.656 --> 52:40.532
Gosh.

52:40.615 --> 52:44.536
All right. Then Na-bi is the loser!

52:45.120 --> 52:46.705
You have to drink the whole glass

52:46.788 --> 52:49.040
-in one go. Here.
-In one go.

52:49.124 --> 52:51.042
<i>Who's going to drink?</i>

52:51.126 --> 52:53.753
<i>-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!
-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!</i>

52:55.130 --> 52:57.799
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

52:58.758 --> 53:00.385
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

53:00.468 --> 53:03.972
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

53:04.055 --> 53:06.600
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

53:11.146 --> 53:12.647
-Oh, my gosh!
-What the hell?

53:12.731 --> 53:15.066
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

53:15.150 --> 53:16.776
All right. Be quiet.

53:17.569 --> 53:18.987
-What? You're going to do it?
-Are you?

53:19.070 --> 53:20.655
Okay, move over.

53:23.617 --> 53:24.618
What? Really?

53:29.623 --> 53:30.999
Let me do it properly.

53:34.419 --> 53:36.254
Wait. I think I'm bleeding.

53:36.338 --> 53:37.881
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm bleeding. But it's okay.

53:37.964 --> 53:39.215
Your braces?

53:40.175 --> 53:41.551
This is crazy!

53:41.635 --> 53:42.552
No way!

53:43.094 --> 53:46.848
-That's crazy!
-That's crazy!

53:46.932 --> 53:48.975
Guys, be quiet.

53:50.018 --> 53:51.519
The neighbors will complain.

53:53.229 --> 53:54.356
Hey, keep it down.

53:56.775 --> 53:57.817
What?

53:57.901 --> 53:59.235
I told you to be quiet.

53:59.319 --> 54:00.487
Sorry.

54:00.570 --> 54:01.404
Yes?

54:04.783 --> 54:05.742
Excuse me.

54:09.204 --> 54:11.289
Don't you know how late it is?
Please be quiet.

54:11.373 --> 54:13.291
You're being way too loud.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.168
I'm sorry.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.170
You have neighbors, you know.

54:17.253 --> 54:21.800
I have some friends over, so…

54:23.885 --> 54:25.261
We'll be careful.

54:27.013 --> 54:29.224
We're taking an exam tomorrow.

54:29.307 --> 54:30.600
Oh, really?

54:30.684 --> 54:33.979
Then we'll silently pray for you
to get a good score.

54:34.062 --> 54:35.563
Thank you.

54:36.147 --> 54:38.733
We'll trust that you'll be quiet.
Bye, then.

54:39.567 --> 54:41.444
-Bye.
-I'm sorry.

55:00.547 --> 55:01.631
You were like a couple.

55:01.715 --> 55:02.799
Be quiet.

55:03.508 --> 55:05.385
-Stop playing drinking games.
-We can't stop!

55:05.468 --> 55:07.512
-Come on.
-Come on!

55:07.595 --> 55:09.848
Let's not stop!
Let's spin it one more time!

55:09.931 --> 55:11.141
Spin it!

55:11.224 --> 55:12.642
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

55:12.726 --> 55:14.853
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

55:15.437 --> 55:16.604
Just a little more.

55:17.188 --> 55:18.732
-It's me!
-Yes!

55:18.815 --> 55:20.984
-It's me!
-What are you talking about?

55:21.067 --> 55:22.277
It's me.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.279
-Sol. Come here.
-What?

55:24.362 --> 55:26.072
-You're going to do it?
-She must be drunk.

55:26.656 --> 55:27.949
You're really going to kiss her?

55:28.950 --> 55:30.493
-Hey.
-Sit back down.

55:30.577 --> 55:32.037
Sit down.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.121
Come on!

55:33.204 --> 55:34.622
Gosh.

55:35.457 --> 55:36.624
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

55:36.708 --> 55:37.917
I'm going out for a smoke.

55:38.793 --> 55:41.004
-What about me?
-She left because of you.

55:41.087 --> 55:42.589
Be quiet.

55:43.173 --> 55:45.258
JUNG JU-HYEOK

55:45.341 --> 55:46.342
This is Sol's.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.303
Hey, Sol!

55:48.386 --> 55:49.554
Hey.

55:49.637 --> 55:52.599
Jung Ju-hyeok? Who is this guy?

55:52.682 --> 55:53.600
Jung Ju-hyeok?

55:53.683 --> 55:54.726
Yes.

55:54.809 --> 55:56.811
That's not important right now. Spin!

55:56.895 --> 55:57.979
Spin!

55:58.063 --> 56:01.524
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

56:18.625 --> 56:20.877
Did you plan this in advance?

56:22.087 --> 56:24.589
What does this make us look like?

56:24.672 --> 56:26.883
You kissed by choice, that's all.

56:27.383 --> 56:29.010
Forget it. Let's go for a smoke.

56:29.094 --> 56:30.053
Let's go.

56:30.136 --> 56:31.429
I'm exhausted.

56:31.513 --> 56:32.472
My legs hurt.

56:33.306 --> 56:35.517
-My gosh.
-Gosh, my legs.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.893
Hey, I'm wearing your shoes!

56:36.976 --> 56:38.436
Oh, my back.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.729
My shoes.

56:39.813 --> 56:41.731
-I'll be back later, Na-bi.
-Okay.

56:42.857 --> 56:43.858
Sol!

56:45.485 --> 56:46.486
You're smoking too?

56:46.569 --> 56:48.446
Yes. But who's Jung Ju-hyeok?

56:48.530 --> 56:50.406
He just called you.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.784
What? Oh.

56:52.867 --> 56:54.119
Just someone I know.

56:54.202 --> 56:55.453
Someone you know?

56:55.537 --> 56:57.580
I thought I knew everyone you knew.

56:57.664 --> 56:58.832
You don't.

57:03.837 --> 57:04.796
It's cold outside.

57:12.554 --> 57:13.596
What were you doing?

57:14.305 --> 57:15.640
Just taking a walk.

57:15.723 --> 57:17.433
Your place is so nice.

57:17.517 --> 57:18.852
My aunt used to live here.

57:22.313 --> 57:24.315
Why did you make things
so hard for yourself?

57:27.318 --> 57:28.736
I know, right?

57:34.451 --> 57:37.829
Hey…

57:37.912 --> 57:41.708
Sol is so beautiful up close.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.252
She's a goddess.

57:44.335 --> 57:45.879
We get it, so just tell her!

57:45.962 --> 57:48.006
Please stop torturing us!

57:49.549 --> 57:50.967
Ji-wan.

57:51.509 --> 57:53.636
What type of guy does Sol like?

57:53.720 --> 57:55.472
He's driving me crazy.

57:56.598 --> 57:58.183
I don't want to tell you.

57:58.266 --> 57:59.434
You don't want to tell me?

58:00.059 --> 58:01.102
What?

58:01.644 --> 58:04.397
Why? You said you'd help me.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.149
She doesn't seem to know, either.

58:06.232 --> 58:08.234
There's no way.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.069
Who else would know, then?

58:12.447 --> 58:13.656
Sol…

58:14.866 --> 58:16.117
Yes?

58:17.035 --> 58:19.370
She hates boring guys like you.

58:19.454 --> 58:22.790
Come on. I'm nothing but fun.

58:22.874 --> 58:24.584
If you took the fun part out of me,

58:26.085 --> 58:27.462
I'd be a zombie. Right?

58:27.545 --> 58:29.005
Don't smoke so much.

58:29.088 --> 58:30.507
But where's Jae-eon?

58:30.590 --> 58:32.091
I don't know. Is he inside?

58:32.675 --> 58:34.302
You're totally ignoring me.

58:34.385 --> 58:37.555
He must be on his phone.
He's always calling someone.

58:37.639 --> 58:40.016
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Yun-ji, either.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.687
Did those two leave together?

58:45.396 --> 58:48.399
Call them. Come on.

58:49.150 --> 58:50.860
Let's go find them.

58:57.325 --> 58:58.910
Where did he go?

59:01.246 --> 59:02.121
What?

59:02.747 --> 59:04.457
What? It's nothing.

59:05.458 --> 59:07.043
Can I borrow some sweatpants?

59:07.126 --> 59:09.087
Sure. I'll get them.

59:09.587 --> 59:10.838
Let me use the bathroom.

59:18.555 --> 59:21.266
That tickles!

59:33.945 --> 59:35.113
Stop it.

59:38.491 --> 59:40.118
It tickles!

59:49.877 --> 59:51.796
Gosh, that startled me.

59:55.592 --> 59:56.968
This is so embarrassing.

1:00:00.221 --> 1:00:01.431
Listen.

1:00:01.973 --> 1:00:06.060
I know this is shameless of me,
but can you keep this a secret?

1:00:06.144 --> 1:00:07.604
Please don't tell the others.

1:00:11.232 --> 1:00:14.235
All right. I won't.

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:15.445
Thank you so much.

1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:16.404
Thank you.

1:00:16.487 --> 1:00:18.615
All right. I get it.

1:00:18.698 --> 1:00:22.535
-Now go on.
-I won't let go of this hand.

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:24.162
Okay, don't. Just go.

1:00:24.245 --> 1:00:25.788
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

1:00:25.872 --> 1:00:26.748
I'm sorry.

1:00:26.831 --> 1:00:28.499
-When did you…
-I'll tell you later.

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:30.168
Let's go.

1:00:38.051 --> 1:00:41.846
I must've been crazy.
How could I have thought he was Jae-eon?

1:00:57.195 --> 1:00:59.572
What? That's it?

1:01:07.538 --> 1:01:09.415
Just tell me if you're not up for it.

1:01:10.541 --> 1:01:11.793
It's not like that.

1:01:12.293 --> 1:01:14.587
Go inside first. I need to make a call.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.246
It was just a game.

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:52.041
I guess she wanted to try it.

1:01:56.295 --> 1:01:57.755
You don't need to explain.

1:01:58.881 --> 1:01:59.841
What about you?

1:02:02.635 --> 1:02:04.095
Didn't you want to try it?

1:02:06.848 --> 1:02:07.807
Why would I?

1:02:09.767 --> 1:02:10.768
Not at all.

1:02:17.775 --> 1:02:19.235
I wanted to do it with you.

1:02:25.450 --> 1:02:26.659
What?

1:02:41.883 --> 1:02:43.301
I thought…

1:02:44.510 --> 1:02:46.304
you felt the same way.

1:03:19.003 --> 1:03:20.630
I won't do it if you don't want to.

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:51.744
Sorry.

1:04:21.065 --> 1:04:22.149
<i>Just like that,</i>

1:04:25.444 --> 1:04:27.238
<i>the gates of hell have opened.</i>

1:05:17.413 --> 1:05:19.290
<i>Jae-eon still isn't contacting me.</i>

1:05:19.957 --> 1:05:21.834
<i>How are your butterflies doing?</i>

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:23.002
<i>I'm going to set them free.</i>

1:05:23.085 --> 1:05:26.881
<i>They're supposed to be free,
but they're locked up because of me.</i>

1:05:27.423 --> 1:05:31.719
<i>I hope it's just love.
Not childish jealousy.</i>

1:05:31.802 --> 1:05:34.347
<i>You know that he only hurts other people.</i>

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:35.473
<i>Were you two close?</i>

1:05:35.556 --> 1:05:37.600
<i>Yes. We're close.</i>

1:05:37.683 --> 1:05:38.976
<i>Closer than you and me, anyway.</i>

1:05:39.518 --> 1:05:41.854
<i>That kind of presence
only comes naturally.</i>

1:05:42.521 --> 1:05:44.065
<i>Some people are gifted like that.</i>

1:05:44.148 --> 1:05:46.609
<i>Then what kind of person am I to him?</i>

1:05:47.193 --> 1:05:48.653
<i>Do you want to meet right now?</i>

1:05:48.736 --> 1:05:49.779
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:51.906
<i>I've been attracted to you</i>

1:05:51.989 --> 1:05:53.032
<i>from the beginning.</i>

1:05:53.115 --> 1:05:55.201
<i>What is this emotion?</i>

1:05:55.701 --> 1:05:56.786
<i>Could it be…</i>

1:05:58.204 --> 1:06:01.582
