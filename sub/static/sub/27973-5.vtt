WEBVTT

00:01.081 --> 00:04.081
Anna is fine. I'll take care of her.

00:07.921 --> 00:10.921
Have you lost your mind?
Get below deck, now!

00:11.121 --> 00:12.521
You're done, Tennstedt!

00:23.721 --> 00:25.281
Your captain is a real pussy,
right?

00:25.441 --> 00:27.801
He shot him right in the face.

00:28.641 --> 00:30.121
- Hoffmann?
- Who else?

04:19.561 --> 04:20.761
That's all?

04:20.881 --> 04:22.041
Yes, Criminal Inspector.

04:22.321 --> 04:25.121
The explosion caused too much damage.
That's the problem.

04:25.441 --> 04:29.161
Only these pieces got stuck inside
the fender.

04:29.681 --> 04:31.601
But we can't figure out their origins.

04:34.321 --> 04:36.041
Have it all brought to my office.

04:41.561 --> 04:44.961
Miss Strasser, this is a statement
for the press. About this woman.

04:45.401 --> 04:47.521
She approached Forster two days ago.

04:47.681 --> 04:51.201
He's sure that she is responsible
for the bombing. Please translate this.

04:51.921 --> 04:52.961
Thanks.

06:51.201 --> 06:52.801
Give him Prontosil.

06:54.001 --> 06:55.001
What?

06:55.121 --> 06:57.761
The cough... suggests pneumonia.

06:58.721 --> 07:01.721
- How do you know?
- My father is a doctor.

07:09.561 --> 07:10.641
Are you sure?

07:15.321 --> 07:17.001
Is it true that you went to Mürwick?

07:18.401 --> 07:19.721
The Navy is my life.

07:28.721 --> 07:29.961
Cook.

07:32.121 --> 07:33.121
How is he?

07:34.081 --> 07:36.801
Not well. He's still burning up.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.921
What's your name, First Watch Officer?

08:14.081 --> 08:16.001
Tennstedt, Captain.

08:20.561 --> 08:22.001
What are you doing here, Tennstedt?

08:23.761 --> 08:25.281
Why are you not at your post?

08:26.521 --> 08:27.721
I've been...

08:33.001 --> 08:36.001
dismissed by Captain Hoffmann.

08:45.121 --> 08:47.761
And now you let the Chief take you
all home.

08:48.441 --> 08:51.041
While your comrades
sacrifice their lives for Germany?

08:52.601 --> 08:56.361
U-612 is a disgrace for the German Navy.

08:56.681 --> 08:57.681
No.

08:59.001 --> 09:02.801
The crew show determined courage
and do good work.

09:04.081 --> 09:05.561
The Captain is a disgrace.

09:06.961 --> 09:08.881
You'll return as a war hero.

09:09.561 --> 09:11.521
I'll be court-martialed in Lorient.

09:12.601 --> 09:15.321
But the Captain should have to
justify himself.

09:24.121 --> 09:25.761
I hereby reinstate you,

09:27.161 --> 09:28.241
First Watch Officer.

10:35.241 --> 10:36.721
Ah, Miss Simone.

10:37.881 --> 10:39.801
I have to ask for your help again.

10:40.041 --> 10:43.041
More information about this Monroe,
from the Spanish Civil War.

10:43.561 --> 10:45.001
A bomb in a church.

10:45.721 --> 10:48.441
I wish I could spare you the details
but I need to know if they say something

10:48.561 --> 10:50.001
about the mechanism used at that time.

10:52.721 --> 10:54.001
And one more thing.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.801
I would like to post one of my men in
front of your apartment. Day and night.

10:56.921 --> 10:58.401
He would always accompany you.

11:00.721 --> 11:01.761
For your safety.

11:04.081 --> 11:08.081
You don't want me to work for you.
You just want to keep an eye on me.

11:09.881 --> 11:11.121
She saw you in my company.

11:12.001 --> 11:14.041
I would never forgive myself
if anything would happen to you.

11:14.361 --> 11:19.201
I think Miss Monroe has bigger fish to fry
than taking care of a simple translator.

11:20.241 --> 11:21.361
I only want what's best for you.

11:22.521 --> 11:24.881
I will be vigilant. I promise.

11:26.161 --> 11:29.801
And thanks for worrying about me.

11:31.801 --> 11:33.801
Please call me as soon as you have
found something.

12:16.081 --> 12:18.001
Hoffmann is not allowed to leave his bunk.

12:18.721 --> 12:19.721
Aye.

12:28.601 --> 12:31.081
Tennstedt, you were ordered to stay
away from the control room!

12:31.641 --> 12:33.241
Engineer Lieutenant Ehrenberg,

12:35.041 --> 12:38.681
as the highest ranking officer
I took over command of U-612

12:39.121 --> 12:44.001
as per my authority conferred
by the High Command of the German Navy.

12:45.961 --> 12:47.001
Excuse me?

12:47.721 --> 12:52.961
Captain Hoffmann is obviously
unable to command the ship.

12:53.361 --> 12:59.201
Any insubordination concerning my decision
will be prosecuted as an act of mutiny.

13:00.401 --> 13:01.881
You can't do that.

13:15.801 --> 13:20.001
Captain Wrangel, it's an honor to
serve under your command.

13:26.441 --> 13:30.321
I am looking forward to our close
cooperation, Chief.

13:44.681 --> 13:46.001
What's going on, Second Watch Officer?

13:46.281 --> 13:48.441
We will finally fire our eels into
the fucking Yank ships.

13:49.401 --> 13:50.721
We're not going home.

13:50.961 --> 13:53.041
What? You can't do that.

13:53.681 --> 13:56.401
We've got strict orders from Lorient!
You have to follow them!

14:01.841 --> 14:04.361
Any resisting elements are to be detained.

14:06.201 --> 14:08.761
Aye. Let's go.

14:11.081 --> 14:12.441
You can't be serious.

14:13.761 --> 14:16.761
The keys to the arms locker,
Petty Officer. That's an order.

14:17.081 --> 14:20.081
What order? You're not our First Watch
Officer anymore.

14:20.641 --> 14:24.001
I'm your superior and therefore you
have to obey my orders! Nothing else!

14:25.321 --> 14:26.641
Detain that man.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.601
Are you deaf?

14:30.121 --> 14:33.761
Take him to the torpedo room and
guard him until further orders.

14:34.601 --> 14:35.681
Understood?

14:39.601 --> 14:40.921
Come with me.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.681
This is a new boat?
Do the propellers sing?

15:19.161 --> 15:20.041
A bit.

15:22.561 --> 15:27.441
I need a report about how long the
fuel will last if we go full speed ahead.

15:35.921 --> 15:39.321
Captain Wrangel is determined to
whip this boat into shape.

15:40.521 --> 15:41.921
Can he count on the engine room?

15:42.321 --> 15:44.721
- What about Hoffmann?
- None of your concern.

15:47.161 --> 15:49.681
It doesn't matter to me who's wearing
the white hat when we arrive home.

15:49.801 --> 15:50.881
Just for the record.

15:51.161 --> 15:53.241
But I don't want to be shot
by a firing squad.

15:53.761 --> 15:55.641
The officers bear the responsibility.

16:08.961 --> 16:11.961
I've seen a lot. But a mutiny,
that's something new.

16:13.961 --> 16:15.401
What are we going to do now?

16:16.521 --> 16:19.321
What we always do. We follow orders.

16:57.441 --> 16:58.801
What's going on?

17:15.241 --> 17:16.921
What the hell is going on?

17:24.841 --> 17:27.401
Captain Wrangel has taken over
your command.

17:31.401 --> 17:32.641
What?

17:35.561 --> 17:36.801
Second Watch Officer Schiller,

17:37.561 --> 17:40.001
place First Watch Officer Tennstedt
and Captain Wrangel under arrest

17:40.041 --> 17:40.961
on charge of mutiny.

17:43.961 --> 17:45.321
That's an order.

17:48.681 --> 17:50.321
With all due respect, Mr. Hoffmann,

17:51.081 --> 17:53.241
you're not the captain
of this U-boat anymore.

17:53.921 --> 17:55.001
Chief.

18:00.881 --> 18:01.841
Robert.

18:08.001 --> 18:09.801
Have you all lost your minds?

18:11.721 --> 18:13.361
Do you all want to be court-martialed?

18:15.961 --> 18:17.761
I know your father, Hoffmann.

18:18.961 --> 18:20.241
Great man.

18:21.441 --> 18:23.201
An example to us all.

18:23.801 --> 18:25.361
Unfortunately you're not like him.

18:25.841 --> 18:28.641
You had the chance to sink
an American ship.

18:29.201 --> 18:32.201
- But you preferred to disappear.
- One of my men was on board.

18:32.681 --> 18:35.281
- He was injured.
- And you handed him over to the Yanks.

18:35.521 --> 18:36.561
Voluntarily.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.001
What's wrong with you, man?

18:41.681 --> 18:44.441
- Are you fraternizing with the enemy?
- I follow orders.

18:44.841 --> 18:46.961
Are you aware of the fact that we
are at war?

18:47.041 --> 18:48.881
A war in which you've been a
prisoner, Wrangel!

18:50.281 --> 18:51.641
And nothing else.

18:52.721 --> 18:55.721
And now I am the Captain of U-612.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.161
Schiller,

18:58.041 --> 18:59.961
take him back to his bunk.

19:02.081 --> 19:03.121
Mister Hoffmann.

19:05.001 --> 19:06.321
Don't you touch me.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.321
Klaus, please.

19:10.161 --> 19:11.681
Go to your bunk.

19:12.801 --> 19:14.161
Get better.

19:20.641 --> 19:22.921
Hopefully you're very well aware of
the fact

19:24.521 --> 19:27.081
that you'll have to justify yourself
in front of a court-martial.

19:49.961 --> 19:51.921
- Chief Helmsman.
- Aye.

19:53.001 --> 19:54.401
New calculation.

19:59.001 --> 20:02.961
Take us to the convoy route.
We will attack them when it's dark.

20:04.081 --> 20:07.081
The Yanks are going to go down
before they even realize what hit them.

20:07.281 --> 20:08.601
Aye, Captain.

20:18.041 --> 20:21.041
Didn't see you as the type to go
against the tide.

20:26.281 --> 20:28.561
The cook told me about Hinz.

20:29.801 --> 20:32.041
I can't believe I defended the faggot.

20:34.121 --> 20:35.641
I'm sorry, comrade.

20:40.721 --> 20:42.361
I would have loved to go home.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.001
Ugh.

21:10.841 --> 21:12.001
That's my bad side.

21:13.561 --> 21:14.801
You're exposed?

21:22.881 --> 21:24.041
Who will they send?

21:44.721 --> 21:45.641
And what about you?

21:48.841 --> 21:49.801
Let's go.

22:00.601 --> 22:01.561
Captain?

22:04.801 --> 22:06.161
What do you think?
What are our chances?

22:07.361 --> 22:08.401
At court martial?

22:09.801 --> 22:11.441
You're thinking about this now?

22:12.881 --> 22:15.881
Jail, First Watch Officer...
best case.

22:16.761 --> 22:17.641
What?

22:18.321 --> 22:20.041
There won't be a court martial.

22:20.961 --> 22:23.601
A Captain who is the only survivor
of his crew,

22:24.361 --> 22:27.681
and a First Watch Officer who got
dismissed because of insubordination.

22:28.361 --> 22:31.201
That will have to be straightened out.
Right?

22:35.001 --> 22:37.641
There is nothing worse
than indetermination.

22:38.281 --> 22:41.681
But to act determined when it's
the only way out,

22:43.081 --> 22:45.641
that requires courage.
Tennstedt.

22:49.321 --> 22:52.321
Are you courageous, First Watch Officer?

22:54.921 --> 22:56.121
Yes, Captain.

23:00.841 --> 23:01.681
Good.

23:03.001 --> 23:04.761
We're going to throw Hoffmann overboard.

23:07.161 --> 23:09.081
They are all simple sailors.

23:09.201 --> 23:11.001
They will do what I want them to do.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.761
Hunting dogs need a firm hand.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.041
Only then they are devoted.

23:17.041 --> 23:18.161
To the death.

23:49.881 --> 23:50.961
Sir?

23:52.761 --> 23:54.121
I have to ask you to follow me.

24:00.001 --> 24:01.641
Act with honor, Schiller.

24:04.121 --> 24:07.001
Like you did when you shot
the poor bastard in the face?

24:07.121 --> 24:08.841
Or when you were drinking beer with that
stinking Jew?

24:08.921 --> 24:09.761
Shut up.

24:33.001 --> 24:34.961
- They want to kill Hoffmann.
- What?

24:35.281 --> 24:37.361
Yes, abandon him.

24:37.801 --> 24:39.001
And nobody steps in?

24:39.561 --> 24:41.681
- No.
- Not even Ehrenberg?

24:43.401 --> 24:45.881
Hoffmann himself always says that
orders have to be followed.

24:47.961 --> 24:49.441
What are you going to do to us?

24:51.961 --> 24:54.961
Whatever they'll do to Hoffmann,
they'll do to us.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.561
I have to take you to the control room.

25:34.641 --> 25:35.881
What's all this?

25:36.881 --> 25:37.841
Imagine

25:39.241 --> 25:41.121
you'd have returned to La Rochelle.

25:42.361 --> 25:43.801
What would have been your outcome?

25:44.081 --> 25:45.241
One dead.

25:45.361 --> 25:48.121
One injured that you left with the Yanks.

25:48.401 --> 25:49.921
But a boat full of eels

25:50.561 --> 25:52.601
because you are just a fucking
passenger steamer for a Jew.

25:53.361 --> 25:56.361
Why do you think Dönitz agreed to
do the exchange?

25:57.001 --> 25:58.841
Because he wants to win the war.

25:59.361 --> 26:02.601
Do you really think
I will watch a new U-boat

26:03.001 --> 26:05.081
and its crew, all fit for combat,
running from the enemy?

26:05.201 --> 26:07.801
U-612 is in an excellent position now,

26:08.241 --> 26:09.841
right on the convoy routes

26:10.961 --> 26:12.281
under my command.

26:14.361 --> 26:15.841
You're so ridiculous, Wrangel.

26:16.561 --> 26:18.081
Captain Hoffmann,

26:18.401 --> 26:21.001
as the highest ranking officer on board
I order you

26:22.041 --> 26:24.601
to leave U-612.

26:25.361 --> 26:29.001
You will get the dinghy
and some provisions.

26:37.041 --> 26:38.561
You all know the order.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.441
You can't let this happen.

26:43.281 --> 26:45.001
The men have nothing to do with this.

26:47.041 --> 26:50.641
I am the highest ranking officer.
The decision rests with me.

26:54.441 --> 26:55.801
The two other men...

26:56.521 --> 26:57.961
Maas and Strasser.

26:58.801 --> 26:59.841
Will go with you.

27:03.001 --> 27:04.001
Why?

27:04.441 --> 27:05.641
Insubordination.

27:05.921 --> 27:07.521
Because they didn't obey your orders,
Tennstedt?

27:08.441 --> 27:09.761
I dismissed you.

27:10.841 --> 27:13.001
Maas and Strasser don't have to obey you.

27:13.441 --> 27:16.241
They can't be punished for fulfilling
their duty. That's not right.

27:17.721 --> 27:20.041
Unless Captain Wrangel wants men

27:21.001 --> 27:23.241
following anyone claiming to be
their captain.

27:24.521 --> 27:27.801
Loyalty, Wrangel, and honor.

27:28.801 --> 27:30.881
But these words probably mean nothing
to you.

27:38.001 --> 27:39.561
Release them.

27:43.761 --> 27:48.401
And you, Hoffmann, can address the men.

28:05.281 --> 28:07.041
I'm talking to you as men of the sea.

28:09.721 --> 28:12.121
Men facing death every single day.

28:17.641 --> 28:19.081
I'm convinced

28:19.241 --> 28:22.001
that only following orders
will result in success.

28:26.881 --> 28:28.921
What you're doing now is open mutiny.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.281
And you know it.

28:35.001 --> 28:36.201
All of you.

28:41.601 --> 28:45.401
I declare my imperturbable faith in
and allegiance to Captain Hoffmann.

28:48.241 --> 28:50.161
Cut the crap, von Haber.

28:50.921 --> 28:52.041
I'll go with you.

28:53.881 --> 28:55.241
Max, no.

28:56.121 --> 28:57.041
No.

28:58.601 --> 29:02.921
I dropped out of the officer's school
because I thought the good guys were here.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.201
On board a U-boat.

29:07.961 --> 29:09.321
But when I look at all of you...

29:12.921 --> 29:15.241
I realize that they accepted any
piece of shit.

29:21.081 --> 29:22.761
I'd rather go with our Captain

29:23.961 --> 29:25.721
than breathe the same air as you.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.841
As you wish.

29:30.361 --> 29:31.641
Ehrenberg?

29:35.921 --> 29:37.161
Would you like to join them?

31:29.321 --> 31:30.401
Come in.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.881
These are Nathalie's things
from the hospital.

31:37.281 --> 31:39.721
Well, just her clothes.

31:46.841 --> 31:47.921
A Jewish girl,

31:48.721 --> 31:51.081
who cries out
your brother's name in the night.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.521
Who's recently had a child.

31:55.321 --> 31:58.321
I'm so sorry. I didn't want you
to get into any trouble.

31:58.761 --> 32:01.241
If I'm at risk,
surely I have a right to know.

32:02.601 --> 32:04.201
Or did you think I'd denounce you?

32:07.641 --> 32:09.721
Nathalie and Frank have a little daughter.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.041
Where is the child now?

32:16.841 --> 32:18.281
She's safe. For now.

32:23.081 --> 32:26.201
If you need any help,
you know where to find me.

32:47.281 --> 32:48.401
Come in.

32:50.601 --> 32:51.881
Criminal Inspector,

32:53.601 --> 32:56.161
I received the final list of 100 hostages.

32:58.001 --> 33:01.761
The document includes comments
from the Mayor for translation

33:01.881 --> 33:04.401
and for your approval. Thanks.

33:05.321 --> 33:07.521
Concerning the security detail for
Miss Strasser...

33:08.401 --> 33:10.761
There's no need.
Tell the man to stand down.

33:25.001 --> 33:27.361
- Frank will return.
- And if he doesn't?

33:28.281 --> 33:29.721
He will return.

33:30.321 --> 33:32.361
U-boats are being sunk all the time.
That's what I'm hearing.

33:34.561 --> 33:35.921
Is it true? That there's a list of names?

33:36.281 --> 33:39.281
A list of people they'll shoot
if anything else happens?

33:43.001 --> 33:44.521
Things have changed.

33:45.521 --> 33:48.521
You can see it out on the streets.
Scared people act differently.

33:48.881 --> 33:51.681
They see a woman of my age pushing a pram.

33:51.761 --> 33:54.561
And suddenly they ask questions
they would normally never ask.

33:54.921 --> 33:56.081
He will come back.

34:13.001 --> 34:14.121
She wants to see you.

34:15.641 --> 34:16.681
Let's go.

34:38.921 --> 34:40.681
Be careful, there's a step.

34:41.921 --> 34:43.001
Leave us.

40:45.361 --> 40:46.441
You know him?

47:38.001 --> 47:39.721
Please take care of those two.

47:44.881 --> 47:46.001
Miss Strasser.

47:46.841 --> 47:48.321
Hello, Criminal Inspector.

47:49.121 --> 47:50.361
Reporting for duty.

47:51.881 --> 47:53.441
Where do you want me to sit?

47:54.841 --> 47:55.881
This way.

48:15.601 --> 48:16.761
Captain?

48:17.681 --> 48:21.161
- Batteries on 80 percent.
- I want them fully charged.

48:22.121 --> 48:23.601
We stay surfaced.

48:24.201 --> 48:25.281
Aye.

48:41.841 --> 48:43.121
Marine radio communication! In English.

48:43.721 --> 48:45.801
Merchant vessel at three five zero.

48:50.721 --> 48:51.961
What a beauty.

48:52.521 --> 48:55.801
Merchant vessel at three five zero.
Distance 2500.

48:56.921 --> 48:58.201
Here we go.

48:59.081 --> 49:00.681
I thought we'd only attack at night?

49:02.001 --> 49:03.801
A big vessel, Chief.

49:04.121 --> 49:05.921
We're going to fuck this one, right?

49:07.161 --> 49:08.721
Battle stations.

49:10.841 --> 49:13.401
- Battle stations.
- Rig ship for dive.

49:14.041 --> 49:16.841
Let's go assholes.
Flood tubes one to four.

49:26.281 --> 49:27.321
Get out of my way.

49:37.521 --> 49:38.681
Conning tower hatch is closed.

49:38.801 --> 49:40.361
Dive, dive, dive. Cycle the vents.

49:50.521 --> 49:51.441
Periscope depth.

49:51.601 --> 49:54.041
Five degrees down on the bow
planes. Zero degrees on the stern planes.

50:05.081 --> 50:08.081
- Steering periscope depth.
- Do you see any escorts?

50:08.561 --> 50:09.681
Destroyers?

50:11.521 --> 50:13.321
Make tubes one to four ready.

50:14.201 --> 50:18.001
New course one-two-four.
Make ready for submerged firing.

50:18.921 --> 50:21.921
Make tubes one to four ready.
New course one-two-four.

50:22.001 --> 50:24.281
- Make ready for submerged firing.
- Outer door for tube number two is open.

50:24.401 --> 50:25.441
Tube number one is open.

50:29.441 --> 50:32.201
- Number four is open.
- Number three is open.

50:32.841 --> 50:34.801
Tubes number one to four ready for
submerged firing.

50:34.961 --> 50:36.681
Torpedo speed 30,

50:37.321 --> 50:39.401
enemy speed 17,

50:40.081 --> 50:43.081
angle-on-the-bow, port 80,
distance 300.

50:48.241 --> 50:50.041
This is too great a risk, Sir.
We're too close!

50:51.041 --> 50:52.881
Protocols say 300 meters minimum!

50:55.721 --> 50:57.161
Fire one! Fire two!

51:00.441 --> 51:03.441
- Fire one! Fire two!
- Fire one! Fire two!

51:10.841 --> 51:15.641
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

51:22.321 --> 51:23.361
Hit.

51:25.761 --> 51:28.601
We did the right thing. Getting rid of
Hoffmann and Max.

51:28.681 --> 51:30.561
It was the right thing to do.
We're lucky again.

51:36.641 --> 51:37.801
Propeller noises.

51:38.801 --> 51:41.121
Multiple!
Everywhere!

51:42.001 --> 51:43.641
I think it's an entire convoy.

51:44.961 --> 51:46.121
An entire convoy.

51:46.601 --> 51:49.601
We gave away our position, Sir.
They will hunt us down!

51:51.001 --> 51:53.161
We stepped into a hornet's nest.

51:53.921 --> 51:58.721
One shouldn't do that, but if one
does, one has to stomp it out.

52:01.121 --> 52:06.281
Torpedo speed 30. Enemy speed 16.
Angle-on-the-bow, zero. Distance 500.

52:08.361 --> 52:09.681
Torpedo speed 30.

52:09.881 --> 52:12.641
Enemy speed 16. Angle-on-the-bow, zero.
Distance 500.

52:12.761 --> 52:13.881
Fire three! Fire four!

52:14.121 --> 52:16.841
- Fire three! Fire four!
- Fire three! Fire four!

52:18.841 --> 52:20.761
- Reload torpedoes!
- Reload torpedoes!

52:21.001 --> 52:23.041
Open it, move it. Release safety.

52:23.161 --> 52:24.281
Open it, quick.

52:25.001 --> 52:25.881
Push it.

52:26.801 --> 52:30.321
Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.

52:30.761 --> 52:34.361
Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen.

52:36.361 --> 52:37.441
Missed target!

52:38.041 --> 52:40.561
- Both missed target!
- Fuck! Move it!

52:42.521 --> 52:43.641
Loud propeller noises.

52:44.081 --> 52:45.881
At one three six. Approaching.

52:47.281 --> 52:49.721
Constant bearing towards the enemy.
They're about to ram us.

52:50.041 --> 52:51.601
We're on collision course!

52:54.081 --> 52:56.081
We're on collision course, Captain.

52:57.521 --> 52:59.001
Maintain course.

53:00.201 --> 53:02.561
We're on collision course.
We have to change course.

53:04.201 --> 53:05.401
Captain!

53:07.681 --> 53:09.921
Welcome your fate, Tennstedt.

53:11.961 --> 53:12.881
What?

53:15.841 --> 53:18.001
Didn't you get what this is all about?

53:18.881 --> 53:19.961
Immortality!

53:20.441 --> 53:22.881
Where are you going, Captain? Captain!

53:28.441 --> 53:30.601
Close outer doors.

53:31.081 --> 53:32.601
Take her down. Quick. Five zero meters.

53:32.761 --> 53:35.161
- All hands forward.
- All hands forward.

53:35.241 --> 53:38.521
All hands forward.

53:40.161 --> 53:42.201
Full down on the bow planes.
Ten degrees down on the stern planes.

53:42.281 --> 53:43.841
- Go, go, go.
- All hands forward.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.161
Go, go, go! Faster!

53:54.241 --> 53:57.401
Move it, go, go, go!
Go, go, go! Faster!

53:57.601 --> 53:58.601
Hard to port.

53:58.721 --> 53:59.841
I need reports.

54:00.921 --> 54:03.001
- Holy shit.
- What?

54:04.001 --> 54:05.681
Propeller noises at zero nine eight.

54:06.281 --> 54:08.041
Destroyer. Approaching.

54:10.401 --> 54:11.441
Amidships.

54:13.761 --> 54:14.961
Hard to starboard.

54:16.241 --> 54:17.401
Silent running.
