12:11.856 --> 12:13.232
-Who are you?
-Britannica.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.442
Because you're British?

12:14.525 --> 12:17.027
No, 'cause I'm smart,
like <i>Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>

12:17.111 --> 12:19.822
Oh. Nerd versus party girl.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.365
Classic structure!

12:21.449 --> 12:23.033
Okay. So...

12:23.117 --> 12:26.078
-maybe I can hit you with my book.
-You can try.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.497
-Like this?
-Ow!

12:29.415 --> 12:31.417
Stop hitting me with knowledge!

12:33.461 --> 12:34.587
[Jenny] Move, Granny!

12:34.670 --> 12:36.714
So, I've been ruminating.

12:37.381 --> 12:40.634
And I have lots of ideas for characters.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.844
[Ruth clears throat]

12:42.678 --> 12:44.430
Mint Julep.

12:45.014 --> 12:49.393
It's more of a bitchy,
Southern debutante type.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.604
Mm-hm.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.315
Um... [clears throat]

12:54.982 --> 12:57.568
The Auntie Christ.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.696
Like, worst aunt ever.

13:00.779 --> 13:07.328
Kind of evil person who gives out raisins
to kids on Halloween.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.245
[Sam] Okay.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.915
Who said you get
to invent your own character?

13:11.165 --> 13:14.460
-Well, you didn't give me one, so...
-I'm still marinating on it.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.926
I get really anxious
when I feel like I'm behind.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.053
Especially in a group setting.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.305
Wow, what a fantastic quality.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.434
I could pair up with someone
who's the same size as me.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.894
Fine. Good idea.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.563
All right, how about wolf lady?

13:36.398 --> 13:38.651
Oh. Oh, no.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.236
We're in a bit of a:

13:40.778 --> 13:42.863
Really? Debbie and now her?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.156
What, are you radioactive?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.075
Not to get too much into it, but...

13:46.784 --> 13:48.577
there's been some weirdness.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.162
Good! Conflict.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.915
Great. Hey, She-Wolf.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.125
Fresh meat.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.592
-About last night...
-It's fine.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.469
It got weird.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.681
-And we should talk about it.
-I think we should stick to wrestling.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.476
You're right. Let's work on your gimmick.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.979
Look at you. You're amazing.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.063
You're mostly there,

14:16.146 --> 14:20.150
but I think you could tap
into the whole werewolf thing even more.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.611
You could enter in a cage...

14:23.487 --> 14:24.738
and you could...

14:24.822 --> 14:26.615
You could wear a collar. Oh!

14:27.157 --> 14:32.413
And the announcer could be like,
"It's a full moon, ladies and germs.

14:32.496 --> 14:36.458
Watch the transformation
of Sheila the She-Wolf

14:36.542 --> 14:38.586
before your very eyes."

14:38.669 --> 14:41.297
Whoa, are we doing a werewolf gimmick?
Because I love it.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.300
No. It doesn't make sense,
'cause I'm not a werewolf.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.218
Werewolves are mythical creatures.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.220
Werewolf, she-wolf, same difference.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.895
Get up, Welfare Queen,
and fight Machu Picchu, the Gentle Giant.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.646
-[Bash] Yes.
-[all cheering]

14:57.730 --> 14:58.772
Hell, no.

14:58.856 --> 15:03.402
I'mma sit here, watch my stories,
eat me some lobster,

15:03.944 --> 15:06.196
-some Howard Foods caviar.
-[women laughing]

15:06.280 --> 15:09.408
All paid for by the American taxpayer.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.618
[all] Boo!

15:11.785 --> 15:14.163
-You mean, you're too lazy to fight?
-Damn right.

15:15.956 --> 15:16.790
[chuckles]

15:17.958 --> 15:19.251
Ah! You see that?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.003
I can control her with my remote.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.005
I can make her go in slow motion.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.966
-All sittin' down.
-Now, this is a gimmick, ladies!

15:26.550 --> 15:27.676
[all cheering]

15:27.760 --> 15:28.928
[both grunting]

15:41.106 --> 15:42.149
Dad!

15:45.653 --> 15:48.280
Oh, Goliath Jackson,
this is such an honor.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.532
I'm a huge fan. I'm a Goliath fan.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.659
You the promoter?

15:51.742 --> 15:56.121
No. I'm more of, like, the brainchild,
the mastermind-slash-fairy godfather.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.958
-We don't have a promoter.
-Who's in charge, then?

15:59.708 --> 16:00.542
[Sam] I'm in charge.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.212
You? [scoffs]

16:03.295 --> 16:04.588
Yeah. I'm the director.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.385
-Did you direct <i>Star Wars?</i>
-No, I didn't direct <i>Star Wars.</i>

16:11.136 --> 16:12.012
Love <i>Star Wars.</i>

16:14.098 --> 16:15.140
Let's go.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.976
No, I'm staying here.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.396
-You wrestle over my dead body.
-You let Tommy and Kurt do it.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.273
It's different.
They're big, dumb boys.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.109
I want you to find a nice man,

16:25.693 --> 16:29.113
have a family, find a job
where people treat you with respect.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.572
People respect me here.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.616
Nobody respects a lady wrestler, sweetie.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.826
It's like the midgets.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.244
You're a sideshow.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.955
-Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
-[Carmen] It's fine.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.207
-It's how we talk.
-No, it's not fine.

16:40.290 --> 16:44.003
This guy-- You can't just come into my gym
and disrespect one of my actors.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.548
I mean, I know you're some big,
famous giant, but you're an asshole,

16:47.631 --> 16:49.591
and you wear oversize diapers
for a living.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.676
[all gasp]

16:50.759 --> 16:53.554
Oh, god damn it. Jesus. Fuck.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.681
A fucking backhand?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.767
What am I, some mouthy housewife?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.602
Want me to hit you
like you're a real man?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.980
Whatever you gotta do
to get the fuck outta here.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.106
Okay, enough.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.232
Dad, stop.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.234
I'll go.

17:10.779 --> 17:11.989
[voice breaking] Sorry, Sam.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.704
Can you guys talk to him?
Can you just try?

17:19.371 --> 17:20.205
Dude.

17:20.664 --> 17:23.083
He was so pissed when he found
that pillow dummy in your bed.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.878
Machu Picchu. Wait!

17:26.545 --> 17:27.379
Wait up.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.810
I understand the shackles
of family expectations.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.105
Your father's got nothing on my mother.
Trust me, just go with it. [clears throat]

17:46.106 --> 17:47.566
Introduce me to your family.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.737
Dad, this is my boyfriend.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.906
My name's Sebastian Howard,

17:53.989 --> 17:56.116
and, uh, your daughter
and I are very much in love.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.078
[Carmen] We take our relationship
very seriously.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.039
But it's also new,
and we're taking things very slow.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.168
But not too slow,
'cause I'm moving in with him.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.003
You wanna wrestle?

18:08.504 --> 18:10.047
You need to learn how to sell.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.298
You're both terrible.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.344
Fine.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.470
I lied.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.305
You've been lying for weeks.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.182
Going on about this new job at Macy's.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.602
Because you wouldn't have let me audition.
I'm 25, Dad.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.105
I don't need your permission.
It's my life.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.649
You can be supportive or I can leave.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.067
Like Mom.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.575
[women grunting and shouting nearby]

18:40.536 --> 18:42.412
-Don't judge.
-I'm not.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.248
I brought you more ice.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.335
That guy had a hundred pounds on me.
He fights for a living.

18:48.919 --> 18:49.753
Wasn't fair.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.174
Why'd you bring me more ice?
What do you want?

18:54.258 --> 18:56.135
I have some concerns about my character.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.015
Welfare Queen.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.352
It's offensive.

19:05.435 --> 19:06.812
That's the genius of it.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.189
It's commentary on an existing stereotype.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.109
It's sort of a fuck-you
to the Republican party

19:12.192 --> 19:15.070
and their welfare reform
and race-baiting shit.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.656
-Yeah, but would other people know that?
-Like who?

19:17.739 --> 19:18.740
My son.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.160
-He goes to Stanford.
-Fancy.

19:21.243 --> 19:25.247
And I don't want him turning on the TV
and getting upset.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.000
It's not that I don't want this job. I do.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.878
You've never had a role
you've been uncomfortable in before?

19:30.961 --> 19:32.963
Sam, I've never had any role before.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.883
I mean, I've only done background work,

19:35.966 --> 19:39.469
some lines on <i>Scarecrow and Mrs. King,</i>
and <i>Gimme a Break.</i>

19:39.553 --> 19:40.721
Well, that's the problem.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.431
That's middle-of-the-road shit.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.348
It's safe.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.017
You see, me?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.977
I like to push the envelope.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.563
I like to jolt people into consciousness.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.315
Like my first feature credit.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.156
<i>Swamp Maidens of the Viet Cong.</i>

19:59.239 --> 20:00.073
Watch it.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.160
This one, <i>Gina the Machina.</i>

20:03.243 --> 20:06.580
This thing? So offensive,
it was banned in 49 states.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.290
Pretty proud of that.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.335
Oh. Look at these.

20:11.418 --> 20:15.088
<i>Couch of Pain, Blood Disco,</i>
<i>Blood Disco Two.</i>

20:15.172 --> 20:16.215
You should watch these.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.801
I mean, bring them back, but...

20:20.677 --> 20:23.138
you know, take them, maybe make notes.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.100
-There's a lot of inspiration there.
-Okay.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.236
What the hell are you doing here?
I am not ready to talk to you.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.987
Yeah, you've made that pretty clear.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.989
You keep hanging up on me
every time I call you.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.992
Just get whatever you need
and get out, okay?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.160
No.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.537
[Debbie scoffs]

20:49.081 --> 20:50.916
God, what is this? An acceptance speech?

20:51.875 --> 20:53.043
You know I get flustered.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.547
I've been reading a book about marriage.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.925
Yeah, good.
A book is really gonna help save this.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.886
I am moving back in.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.601
I have been sleeping on my cousin's couch
for two weeks.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.436
-I have given you space.
-A couch?

21:12.020 --> 21:15.941
Oh, Mark, I'm so sorry. That sounds awful.
Can I do anything to make you feel better?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.361
You are still angry, and that's fine.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.281
But the fact is, I have rights here.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.908
I pay our mortgage,

21:25.409 --> 21:28.620
I pay our utilities,
so, I am going to stay here

21:29.162 --> 21:31.832
in our
guest room-slash-office-slash-craft-area.

21:31.915 --> 21:32.916
If you don't like it,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.960
you can file for divorce.
This is my house.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.173
Now...

21:40.716 --> 21:42.759
can I put Randy to bed, please?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.512
You wanna sleep here?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.308
Be my guest.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.479
[sighs] Shit.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.407
[sniffs]

22:06.116 --> 22:06.992
[groans]

22:08.827 --> 22:11.330
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

22:11.830 --> 22:14.041
Is that dead? What is that?

22:14.124 --> 22:15.459
It was a squirrel.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.961
What-- What the hell is wrong with you?

22:18.045 --> 22:20.213
-You killed that thing?
-I didn't kill it.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.799
I found it and I brought it here.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.512
I think you should sleep somewhere else.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.318
I'm not going anywhere.

22:42.110 --> 22:42.944
So...

22:43.570 --> 22:46.907
take your squirrel,
and you sleep somewhere else.

22:47.407 --> 22:48.366
You goddamn...

22:49.451 --> 22:50.285
wolf.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.083
-You just called me a wolf.
-What?

22:59.211 --> 23:01.588
You just called me a goddamn wolf!
[scoffs]

23:02.214 --> 23:03.048
Yeah?

23:06.051 --> 23:08.053
Well, most people call me a freak, so...

23:10.847 --> 23:11.681
thank you.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.096
I've worn this...

23:52.597 --> 23:55.809
or some version of this,
every day for the past five years.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.274
It's not a costume.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.155
[sniffles] Just me.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.201
And what I do in the morning...

24:13.952 --> 24:16.121
what I put on, what I wear...

24:17.873 --> 24:18.999
it's not for you.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.420
It's-- It is for <i>me.</i>

24:24.796 --> 24:25.630
I get it.

24:27.507 --> 24:28.341
I think.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.313
I know that I'm a human.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.650
But spiritually, I'm a wolf.

24:51.698 --> 24:52.532
When...

24:53.200 --> 24:55.994
I was 10 and my grandfather died...

24:57.037 --> 24:58.246
I was so depressed.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.540
And...

25:00.749 --> 25:05.962
I-- I felt deeply connected
to <i>Anne of Green Gables.</i>

25:06.463 --> 25:07.297
So...

25:07.839 --> 25:12.594
I wore a straw hat and puffy sleeves
to school every day for a whole year.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.182
It's...

25:18.391 --> 25:20.936
You know, it's a related feeling.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.152
I haven't lived with anyone
in a very long time. [sighs]

25:33.406 --> 25:34.241
Me, neither.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.868
Maybe we need a system.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.664
For privacy.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.334
Yeah.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.252
Okay.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.463
What about the old sock-on-the-door trick?

26:00.684 --> 26:01.768
Oh, you mean right now?

26:05.188 --> 26:06.022
Okay. Heh.

26:15.448 --> 26:16.449
[exhales deeply]

26:19.577 --> 26:24.749
Prepare yourself to be offended,
disgusted, and horrified.

26:24.833 --> 26:25.667
[all chuckle]

26:29.421 --> 26:31.923
[disco music playing on video]

26:35.051 --> 26:38.930
"Every night, a group of friends attend
the greatest dance party of their lives,

26:39.014 --> 26:42.017
knowing at the stroke of dawn,
one of them will be randomly murdered.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.936
-[Jenny] Ooh!
-Who is the monster in the mirrored mask?

26:45.020 --> 26:47.105
From schlock-master Sam Sylvia,

26:47.188 --> 26:50.525
<i>Blood Disco</i> is a disturbing morality tale
for our generation."

26:51.109 --> 26:52.610
-Yeah.
-[all cheer]

26:53.194 --> 26:55.322
Oh, <i>Blood Disco.</i>

26:55.905 --> 26:57.824
Where'd you guys dig up
that old chestnut?

26:58.575 --> 27:00.285
-[Tammé] Uh...
-Excuse me. Sorry.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.162
Who are you?

27:02.245 --> 27:04.331
Oh, hey, I'm Keith. I'm Cherry's husband.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.042
-Where's Cherry?
-She's taking a shower.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.918
There's no hot water in the morning,

27:09.002 --> 27:11.921
'cause there's 14 women living
in this shitty, rundown motel.

27:15.008 --> 27:18.136
Bash say, give you poolside view.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.347
Well, it's a view of the parking lot.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.639
Very convenient.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.768
Enjoy your stay.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.614
[all shrieking and screaming]

27:37.697 --> 27:39.407
Oh, no!

27:40.533 --> 27:43.203
[women screaming on TV]

27:43.787 --> 27:45.664
[Melrose] I don't like being scared.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.165
Ah. That's it. That's me.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.418
-What? Where?
-I'm the guy on the motorcycle.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.047
-I did two days of stunts on this.
-Jesus. So, you guys are a stunt couple.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.092
-So, you've worked with Sam before.
-Yeah, twice.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.011
And partied with him
an extra five years after that.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.723
Hmm. In your opinion,
one professional to another,

28:04.724 --> 28:05.683
do you trust him?

28:05.767 --> 28:08.686
Or is he just another
white racist director?

28:09.854 --> 28:13.024
He's more sexist than racist,
in my experience.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.776
[Justine] Shh.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.778
[disco music playing on video]

28:24.160 --> 28:26.037
[all laughing]

28:27.414 --> 28:29.207
[screams]

28:31.418 --> 28:33.628
-Oh, no!
-God, please, no!

28:33.711 --> 28:34.546
[all booing]

28:34.629 --> 28:36.673
<i>I'm Sam. I'm a filmmaker.</i>

28:38.341 --> 28:41.511
<i>Um, people say I have</i>
<i>a zany sense of humor.</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:45.306
<i>Uh, if you're watching this</i>
<i>and you can't stand smokers,</i>

28:45.390 --> 28:47.475
<i>I would just fast-forward</i>
<i>to the next schmuck.</i>

28:48.226 --> 28:50.353
<i>So, why am I doing this? I don't know.</i>

28:51.062 --> 28:53.398
<i>I guess I've reached that age</i>
<i>where I have to admit</i>

28:53.481 --> 28:55.650
<i>I'm just looking</i>
<i>for a partner I can stand.</i>

28:55.734 --> 29:00.822
<i>Uh... who has a great smile</i>
<i>and a great figure,</i>

29:00.905 --> 29:05.744
<i>who doesn't tear me apart like a banshee</i>
<i>every time I make a mistake.</i>

29:05.827 --> 29:09.205
<i>You know, someone who's fun,</i>
<i>not a hypocrite...</i>

29:11.124 --> 29:12.125
<i>under 30.</i>

29:13.877 --> 29:15.253
<i>Yeah. Uh...</i>

29:16.713 --> 29:18.381
<i>So, you know, choose me.</i>

29:19.132 --> 29:22.010
<i>Yeah, I'm lonely, and my cock works great.</i>

29:26.055 --> 29:27.390
<i>Should we do another one?</i>

29:27.974 --> 29:28.850
[screaming]

29:28.933 --> 29:30.101
Well, I'd date him.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.978
-Stacey.
-What? He's cute, he's lonely,

29:32.061 --> 29:33.062
and his cock works great.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.523
[Dawn] Can't believe
everything you see on TV.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.193
And I'm uncomfortable now.
Good night, ladies.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.861
[Dawn] Good night, Keith.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.822
I don't know about y'all,
but I learned a lot tonight.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.328
[humming]
