<i>HOUSE: I don't know
how I got here.</i>

00:04.130 --> 00:06.132
<i>I saw a symptom
before the crash.</i>

00:06.257 --> 00:07.509
Why was I taking a bus?

<i>KUTNER: Medical hypnosis can bring
the brain to a Class 2 Theta state.</i>

00:10.929 --> 00:12.847
You're taxing
an already injured brain.

00:12.972 --> 00:15.433
Someone's dying
because I can't remember...

00:16.351 --> 00:17.477
HOUSE: It was Amber.

00:17.602 --> 00:18.895
She was
on the bus with me.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.772
She's the one who's dying.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.443
DOCTOR: Her heart won't stop racing.
No idea what's causing it.

00:25.568 --> 00:27.445
Sure it wasn't the bus
that landed on her?

00:27.570 --> 00:28.488
It's not trauma.

00:28.613 --> 00:31.032
She was stable post-op.
This didn't start until an hour ago.

00:31.157 --> 00:31.991
My God.

00:32.117 --> 00:33.535
HOUSE: Delayed reaction
to the trauma.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.495
HOUSE: She lost both her kidneys
in the bus crash,

00:35.620 --> 00:36.871
ripped up
her femoral artery.

00:36.996 --> 00:40.250
We fixed the artery,
got her on dialysis for the kidneys.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.544
Whatever's doing this to her heart,
it isn't from the crash.

00:42.669 --> 00:43.795
- Check her potassium?
- Of course.

00:43.920 --> 00:44.963
Why didn't
you call me?

00:45.088 --> 00:47.382
She's been under the whole time.
She had no ID.

00:47.507 --> 00:49.134
- Pushed adenosine?
- And verapamil.

00:49.259 --> 00:50.677
And floated
a Swan an hour ago.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.095
Coronary angiography?

00:52.220 --> 00:53.596
Three critical patients
ahead of her.

00:53.722 --> 00:56.182
We'll have her in
within the hour.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.893
We're fifteen minutes away
from Princeton-Plainsboro by ambulance.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.854
You want to move her?
Her heart rate is 130.

01:00.979 --> 01:03.148
She's hemodynamically stable.
We're moving her.

01:03.273 --> 01:05.734
You're not her doctor,
you can't make that decision.

01:08.445 --> 01:09.863
Her husband can.

01:11.740 --> 01:12.824
Right?

01:14.868 --> 01:16.077
Move her.

01:17.746 --> 01:19.330
If the trauma
didn't damage her heart...

01:19.456 --> 01:20.749
Why was she on the bus?

01:20.874 --> 01:21.791
I don't know.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.418
If she had
any underlying condition,

01:23.543 --> 01:24.919
the accident could
have exacerbated it.

01:25.044 --> 01:25.962
Why were you with her?

01:26.087 --> 01:27.046
I don't know.

01:27.172 --> 01:29.090
I'm not hiding anything,
I just don't remember.

01:29.215 --> 01:31.050
What else could
damage her heart?

01:32.761 --> 01:34.262
Wilson. Don't get lost.

01:34.387 --> 01:36.473
I'm barely coherent.
I need your help right now.

Her heart's
already damaged.

You restart it,
it'll keep racing,

01:55.909 --> 01:57.911
shoot off free radicals
and kill her brain.

01:58.036 --> 02:01.873
We ice her down, put her on bypass
until you've diagnosed her.

02:03.082 --> 02:05.919
This is not a solution.
All you're doing is pressing pause.

02:06.044 --> 02:08.546
It gives you more time
to find the diagnosis.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.465
House. This is Amber.

Please.

Cold saline solution.

down to 90.

03:46.561 --> 03:47.854
Why are
we doing this?

03:49.522 --> 03:51.107
Bought us time
to think.

04:00.867 --> 04:03.786
The trauma must have stimulated
a pre-existing heart condition.

04:03.912 --> 04:05.580
Auto-immune,
congenital anomaly,

04:05.705 --> 04:07.498
blood-clotting disorder,
lead poisoning...

04:07.624 --> 04:08.458
Could be anything.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.293
Great. Let's explore that.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.711
Quick, get her on panacea.

04:11.836 --> 04:14.547
We can narrow it down
by looking for arterial blockages.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.215
How? On an echo?

04:16.341 --> 04:18.009
Can't see wall motion
when there's no motion.

04:18.134 --> 04:20.345
EKG? Nope, heart's in
the off position.

04:20.470 --> 04:22.305
Thallium uptake scan?
Useless on a cold heart.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.390
Yeah, we get it.
Her heart's not beating.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.683
It's gonna make it
harder to diagnose.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.977
On the other hand, she's not gonna die
while you're whining about it.

04:28.102 --> 04:28.937
What else?

04:29.062 --> 04:31.397
There is another way
to narrow it down.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.442
If you really did see
a symptom in Amber before the crash,

04:34.567 --> 04:37.278
physostigmine
helped your memory last time.

04:37.403 --> 04:40.406
Why not cyanide?

04:41.157 --> 04:42.742

this morning.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.369
I can't do
any more drugs till lunch.

04:44.494 --> 04:47.163
Get her an angiogram. it could
show damage even in a stopped heart.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.706
Rest of you,
search her apartment.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.750
Toxins,
heavy metals, drugs...

04:50.875 --> 04:53.086
Anything that might
make her heart race.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.649
I need to know
if there's anything medically relevant

05:14.774 --> 05:16.734
that you couldn't
share publicly.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.363
Is this
a Philanderers Anonymous intervention?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.031
You were obviously
drinking last night.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.117
Maybe you took Amber
to a bar?

05:24.242 --> 05:26.202
I left here on my motorcycle.
Alone.

05:26.327 --> 05:29.080
You ended up drunk on a bus.
Together.

05:29.205 --> 05:30.540
Maybe you met Amber
in the bar?

05:30.665 --> 05:32.583
I was not having
an affair with her.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.086
You can't really say that
if you don't remember.

05:35.211 --> 05:37.171
I lost four hours,
not four months.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.841
Maybe it was
the first time.

05:40.550 --> 05:44.178
If you drank together,
any chance you did any drugs?

05:48.808 --> 05:50.935
I'll run a tox screen.

06:07.827 --> 06:09.495
You coming?

06:10.246 --> 06:12.582
Correspondence.
Letters to patients.

06:12.707 --> 06:14.709
She could have caught something
from one of them.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.836
Copy it to a thumb drive.
Let's get out of here.

06:16.961 --> 06:19.839
Travel. Do you know if she's been
out of the country recently?

06:19.964 --> 06:23.217
It's just video clips.
Maybe she narrates where they are.

06:24.761 --> 06:27.055
<i>WILSON: And action!</i>

06:27.180 --> 06:29.223
Looks like
she didn't travel very far.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.184
<i>- You look beautiful.
-You look nervous.</i>

06:31.309 --> 06:33.311
<i>I've never
done this before.</i>

06:33.436 --> 06:36.272
<i>I have. Trust me.
You'll love it.</i>

06:39.942 --> 06:42.320
- Hey.
- Not even close to relevant.

06:50.495 --> 06:51.954
As long as we don't know
what's wrong,

06:52.080 --> 06:53.456
we don't know
what's relevant.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.584
Yeah, maybe they're having sex
on a pile of asbestos.

06:56.709 --> 06:57.794
Go watch it.

06:57.919 --> 06:58.878
If we were in
a stranger's house,

06:59.003 --> 07:00.129
you'd be
watching the video.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.840
You altered your behavior
because you're friends with her.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.926
Are you okay?

07:05.051 --> 07:06.719
We shouldn't be
treating her at all.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.431
I'm gonna
search her bathroom.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.666
AMBER:
Are you okay?

07:38.501 --> 07:41.879
Can't really say "yes"
when it's a hallucination asking.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.132
Don't worry,
you're just dreaming.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.176
What symptom
did I see in you?

07:48.886 --> 07:50.638
- A myoclonic jerk.
- Boring.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.475
An incredibly rare
neurological symptom is boring?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.435
Am I in someone else's
subconscious?

07:56.561 --> 07:59.772
What did we do
last night?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.911
Was I meeting you
for a drink?

08:14.036 --> 08:15.580
Is that all it was?

08:18.416 --> 08:21.878
A man thinks
a woman is beautiful,

08:22.628 --> 08:24.755
admires
her intelligence,

08:24.881 --> 08:29.594
admires the way she has to get
whatever she wants.

08:30.595 --> 08:32.722
The things he likes
about himself.

08:33.598 --> 08:40.104
And maybe she always had
a little thing for him.

08:41.272 --> 08:44.317
His mind,
his blue eyes.

08:46.319 --> 08:49.155
But someone
gets between them.

08:49.989 --> 08:53.159
So they decide
to meet one night

08:53.284 --> 08:55.328
at an out-of-the-way
little bar...

08:56.204 --> 08:58.247
Does that
sound familiar?

09:04.045 --> 09:05.880
Do I feel familiar?

09:10.259 --> 09:12.261
What do you feel?

09:15.932 --> 09:17.850
Electricity.

09:22.772 --> 09:24.148
Electricity.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.942
I know
I saw the symptom.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.278
I know the memory is locked in my brain,
now I know how to get it.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.780
No.

09:31.239 --> 09:32.406
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.991
You need to rest.

09:34.116 --> 09:38.246
I have yet to hear about any study
linking electricity and rest.

09:38.371 --> 09:39.997
Deep brain stimulation.

09:40.122 --> 09:40.998
It's been proven.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.334
Electrical impulses
applied directly to the hypothalamus

09:43.459 --> 09:44.460
can evoke
detailed memories.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.586
My mistake.

09:45.711 --> 09:46.629
Drilling a hole

09:46.754 --> 09:50.174
and shooting lightning bolts into an
already cracked skull is very restful.

09:50.299 --> 09:51.717
It's not fatal at all.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.511
She's right.
You need to sleep.

Can you ask her
if we can be excused?

10:25.251 --> 10:26.377
What?

10:31.257 --> 10:32.758
The coronary angio
was negative.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.302
So was the tox screen.

10:35.136 --> 10:36.804
That's what you found?
Negative tests?

10:36.929 --> 10:39.181
I could have told you
she doesn't do drugs.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.519
I found these in her apartment.
Sorry.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.647
Prescription diet pills,
SSRIs, amphetamines.

10:46.772 --> 10:49.650
Diet pills cause structural damage
to the mitral valve,

10:49.775 --> 10:51.277
could explain
the tachycardia.

10:51.402 --> 10:52.528
She'd have to be an addict

10:52.653 --> 10:54.739
to take enough for her
to damage her heart. I'd know.

10:54.864 --> 10:57.158
Did you know she was hiding them
in her vitamins?

10:57.283 --> 10:58.409
We have to warm her back up,

10:58.534 --> 11:00.578
get her heart beating
so we can do a CT to confirm.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.288
No.
We've been over this.

11:02.413 --> 11:03.914
Starting her heart
could cause brain damage,

11:04.040 --> 11:06.709
could burn out
the heart muscle.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.753
Test her heart
without starting it.

11:08.878 --> 11:11.464
Crack her chest open. Reach
a finger inside the pulmonary vein,

11:11.589 --> 11:13.215
run it across the valve.

11:13.341 --> 11:14.884
That's the safer course?

11:15.009 --> 11:16.302
It is if we're wrong.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.596
When did we start assuming
we're wrong?

11:20.306 --> 11:21.390
If this were
any other patient...

11:21.515 --> 11:23.893
If the valve is calcified,
that's our answer,

11:24.018 --> 11:25.436
that's our cure. Go.

Thirteen.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.864

the diet pills?

11:36.989 --> 11:38.324
Kutner.

You didn't even go
in the bathroom, did you?

11:41.160 --> 11:43.954
You're suddenly mute
in the differentials.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.915
A blow-up doll
would be more useful.

11:46.040 --> 11:46.999
And yes,
that's the first time

11:47.124 --> 11:50.127
I've ever implied something negative
about a blow-up doll.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.337
It's Amber. I don't...

11:51.462 --> 11:52.671
Normally,
I'd be fascinated.

11:52.797 --> 11:54.215
Today, don't care.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.717
Get over whatever it is
and do your job.

12:10.523 --> 12:13.234
Wait. Look at her eye.

12:15.444 --> 12:16.487
She's jaundiced.

12:16.612 --> 12:17.738
Her liver's not working.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.782
Diet pills
don't kill the liver.

12:21.242 --> 12:22.785
Put her back in ICU.

12:26.539 --> 12:28.749
FOREMAN: Liver failure means
whatever this thing is, it's spreading.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.167
Despite the fact
that she's frozen.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.170
Hepatic and heart failure
could mean anti-trypsinase deficiency.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.047
We can stick
a needle in her liver.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.507
We see fibrosis,
she's right.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.300
Does Amber drink sherry?

12:39.385 --> 12:40.970
Nocardia
fits just as well,

12:41.095 --> 12:42.555
but there's no way
we can tell,

12:42.680 --> 12:44.265
since we can't
take her temperature.

12:44.390 --> 12:47.518
I had a dream
she was pouring me a glass.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.771
And since I'm a scotch, beer,
gin and rum man...

12:50.896 --> 12:54.066
If we warm her back up, we should be
able to tell if she's got an infection.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.443
Yes, we can get
a diagnosis

12:55.568 --> 12:58.571
by letting the disease
run rampant until it kills her.

12:58.696 --> 13:00.948
If it's spreading,
we need to slow this even more.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.451
We've got to
cool her down further.

13:06.704 --> 13:10.708
I know you love her
and you're scared she's going to die.

13:11.292 --> 13:14.753
But just making her colder
and colder isn't a cure.

13:14.879 --> 13:17.590
It's not dealing
with the reality.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.176
Sherry means
something.

13:20.301 --> 13:21.844
Amber doesn't
even drink sherry.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.721
House,
can we get back to...

13:23.846 --> 13:26.932
If she did drink sherry, it would
mean nothing, but since she doesn't,

13:27.057 --> 13:29.602
my subconscious is obviously
trying to make some other point.

13:29.727 --> 13:32.688
There's a Sharrie's Bar on Third,
right off the bus route.

13:40.112 --> 13:43.157
Wilson's right.
We need to make her colder.

13:43.282 --> 13:45.618
Putting more ice on her
is just delaying the diagnosis.

13:45.743 --> 13:48.913
Not on, in.
Fill her lungs with slurry.

13:49.038 --> 13:49.872
Where are you going?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.916
Taking Wilson out
for a drink.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.302
Is this the place?

14:03.427 --> 14:04.386
Maybe.

14:04.512 --> 14:10.476
Hey.
I assume you are here for these.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.565
Did you see me here
with a tall, blonde woman?

14:16.690 --> 14:20.361
Yeah, I think she joined you
after scotch number seven.

14:20.486 --> 14:21.612
Did she seem sick?

14:21.737 --> 14:23.322
She sneezed.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.115
I gave her a napkin.

14:25.241 --> 14:26.450
Did you see
the color of the sputum?

14:26.575 --> 14:28.619
I assume sputum
means snot.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.829
Look, I see lots
of drunk chicks in here.

14:30.955 --> 14:34.542
I didn't have time to stop and analyze
the color of your girlfriend's boogers.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.418
She's not
my girlfriend, genius.

14:36.544 --> 14:39.296
She was hot,
you seemed into her

14:39.421 --> 14:40.673
and she
bought you drinks.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.508
Last night,
she was your girlfriend.

14:49.098 --> 14:52.685
Blood in her sputum. It could
mean parasites. Any recent travel?

14:52.810 --> 14:54.395
You seemed into her?

14:54.520 --> 14:57.147
If he had a brain,
he wouldn't be tending bar.

14:57.273 --> 14:58.774
Sneezing's
a new symptom.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.402
Let's assume the runny nose
means an infection.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.030
What did House
have to say?

15:05.155 --> 15:06.991
He told me
I was raised by wolves,

15:07.116 --> 15:10.077
and that's why I use the same hand
for my fork and knife.

15:10.536 --> 15:11.495
Whoa.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.872
Not that one.
The slurry tube.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.171
I know this is different.
But it's not.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.132
Everyone dies.

15:23.716 --> 15:25.134
She's not dead.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.928
You're reacting this way
because she might be soon.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.514
Yeah. I am.
Why aren't you?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.142
I'm an Indian guy
named Kutner.

15:33.559 --> 15:36.103
Ever wonder
what happened to my parents?

15:36.228 --> 15:38.063
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- I was six years old.

15:38.188 --> 15:41.108
I used to like helping out
in my parent's store after school.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.568
A guy walks in
to rob the place,

15:42.693 --> 15:44.111
ends up
shooting them both.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.696
Wasn't fair.

15:45.821 --> 15:50.117
Took years, but I had to accept
that's just the way it was.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.455
So, you gonna help me
fill her lungs up, or not?

16:05.466 --> 16:10.137
Tell me the liver biopsy
showed infiltrates, minor inflammation.

16:10.262 --> 16:11.472
Yeah. How...

16:11.597 --> 16:14.433
Snot on a napkin.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.018
Add the heart,
the infiltrates...

16:16.143 --> 16:17.478
Hep B.

16:17.603 --> 16:21.190
Start her on IV interferon.
I'll go tell Wilson.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.232
Good idea.

16:22.358 --> 16:24.985
And I'll go nap,
because I was concussed last night

16:25.110 --> 16:26.862
and had a heart attack
this morning.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.114
I'll tell Wilson.
You go sleep.

16:47.675 --> 16:50.219
Hepatitis B
is a lame diagnosis.

16:50.344 --> 16:53.806
Oh, God, I get less rest
when I'm asleep.

16:55.808 --> 16:58.018
I rise from the dead
and that's reaction I get?

16:58.143 --> 16:59.186
I'm sorry.
If I had known,

16:59.311 --> 17:01.814
I would have started
a breakaway Jewish sect.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.399
Hep B fits.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.485
Why are
you doing that?

17:06.610 --> 17:08.779
Because Hep B
doesn't fit.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.709
Turn her over.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.836
We're about to start
her second course of interferon.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.964
Which she might not need
once you turn her over.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.013
The small
of her back.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.850
She's bruised.
Why is that significant?

17:37.975 --> 17:39.727
Look closer.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.312
A rash.

17:42.438 --> 17:45.232
How'd you know
what was on the small of her back?

17:45.357 --> 17:49.903
Well, either I'm still asleep,
or I'm starting to remember.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.162
Looks like
an influenza rash.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.372
The flu wouldn't be killing
the organs one by one.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.749
Dermatomyositis.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.417
Wouldn't speed up
her heart.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.128
Maybe it's an allergic reaction
to the interferon?

18:06.253 --> 18:10.174
Yes, the symptom I saw on the bus
was a rare interferon allergy

18:10.299 --> 18:13.051
that flares up
two days before you take it.

18:14.595 --> 18:16.930
How'd you see
the rash down there?

18:17.055 --> 18:19.975
I don't know.
Maybe she leaned over.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.853
Maybe it's not a rash at all.
Could be an abscess.

18:22.978 --> 18:24.188
Thirteen,
stick a needle in there.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.689
If there's pus,
Foreman's right.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.149
Ultrasound is safer.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.318
I'm not asking you to stick
a needle all the way through her.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.320
- Taub, you do it.
- No. Wait, I can do it.

18:31.445 --> 18:33.363
No, apparently,
you can't.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.581
It's not fluctuant.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.668
Clear, it's not pus.

18:46.794 --> 18:48.378
Means it's vesicular.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.297
Rocky Mountain
Spotted Fever.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.802
We had dinner with a friend last week.
We walked their dogs.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.137
I guess she could've
gotten a tick.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.181
It's treatable,
doxycycline.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.642
Allow eight hours
for the antibiotics to take effect,

19:01.767 --> 19:03.769
then we warm her up,
shock her heart.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.145
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.189
If we're wrong,
restarting her heart could kill her.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.607
Run blood cultures first.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.400
Fastest way
to test is to treat.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.986
If we're wrong, still should give us
time to try something else.

19:13.111 --> 19:17.157
We are not starting her heart
until we're 100% certain.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.535
We're never 100% certain.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.290
Run the blood cultures.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.836
After we get confirmation,
we'll restart her heart.

19:30.629 --> 19:33.340
He's wrong.
And you know he's wrong.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.718
You can't change your mind just because
a family member starts crying.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.053
They're always scared.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.931
I said
run the blood cultures.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.826
Sorry. Wide stance.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.247
You're right.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.457
I'm screwing up.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.167
Why are you screwing up?

20:09.293 --> 20:10.419
I didn't even like her.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.004
Did you hate her?

20:12.129 --> 20:13.422
Not enough
to want her dead.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.633
So it's not guilt.
That just leaves fear.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.970
A young woman dying.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.974
A young doctor dying, in fact.
That sound familiar?

20:25.934 --> 20:27.060
(SIGHS)

20:28.103 --> 20:31.189
Yeah, I'm at risk
for Huntington's.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.149
I've dealt with it.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.317
By not getting tested.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.778
Dealing with it
by not dealing with it.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.280
It's clearly
working beautifully.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.908
You're the champion
of not dealing with your problems.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.076
My grandson gave me a mug
that says that.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.246
Okay. Enough hand-holding.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.833
Deal with it, get back in there,
or pack up your stuff.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.210
You're screwing up this case
worse than I am.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.109
House is gonna
kill the patient.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.076
What are you...
What are you doing?

22:06.743 --> 22:07.995
She's up to
80 degrees.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.413
We're gonna
restart her heart.

22:09.538 --> 22:10.372
No, you're not.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.874
There's still time to undo this.
Cool her back down.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.376
You weren't taking
the safe approach.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.503
We've got to know
if the antibiotics are working.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.296
Her EEG's slowed.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.632
Amber.

22:21.675 --> 22:22.509
Amber.

22:25.887 --> 22:26.722
Well done.

22:26.847 --> 22:27.681
We still don't know
what it is,

22:27.806 --> 22:29.891
but you've just let it spread
to her brain!

22:32.978 --> 22:35.772
WILSON: This is exactly what I said
would happen. It's in her brain now.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.816
CUDDY: The brain involvement
gives us a new symptom.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.443
That wouldn't be there
if you hadn't...

22:39.568 --> 22:42.070
It's where the disease was going.
We needed to know that.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.530
This was not
your decision to make!

22:43.655 --> 22:45.866
You went behind my back.
You went behind House's back.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.117
Inside voices.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.785
House wanted
to warm her up.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.747
You just quilted him
into changing his mind.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.668
Heart, liver, rash
and now her brain.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.506
Auto-immune fits best.
Crash trauma could've set it off.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.676
Start her on prednisone,
then we'll warm her up again.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.137
House, if this is
some other infection,

23:07.262 --> 23:10.265
the steroids will
trash her immune system.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.438
He's the attending.
You're the family.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.440
Go spend more time
with the patient.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.326
You can't do this.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.578
That's not
a good argument.

23:31.703 --> 23:34.456
It's not an argument at all.
I'm sorry.

24:01.233 --> 24:04.778
Cuddy's right.
I was afraid to do anything.

24:04.903 --> 24:08.865
I thought if everything just stopped,
it would be okay.

24:09.658 --> 24:10.742
And it's gonna be.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.619
Taub's starting treatment,
we're doing everything...

24:12.744 --> 24:13.870
Not everything.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.333
Before you warm her up...

24:18.458 --> 24:22.462
You said you wanted to try
deep brain stimulation.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.089
But there's no reason.

24:24.214 --> 24:25.423
We know the symptom.
We know what I saw.

24:25.549 --> 24:26.591
What if it's
not the rash?

24:26.716 --> 24:28.802
What if you saw the rash
in the ambulance,

24:28.927 --> 24:30.470
or when we were
putting her on bypass?

24:30.595 --> 24:34.683
What if there is still something else
stuck inside your head?

24:40.856 --> 24:45.318
You think I should risk my life
to save Amber's.

24:53.577 --> 24:54.995
(CHUCKLES)

25:18.310 --> 25:21.688
I'm inserting the IPG probe
into your ventral hypothalamus.

25:23.315 --> 25:24.274
Give me 3 volts.

25:33.742 --> 25:34.701
<i>HOUSE:
I can't hear him.</i>

25:34.826 --> 25:35.744
<i>WILSON:
Can't hear who?</i>

25:36.411 --> 25:37.662
Everything's
in black and white.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.497
Who was talking?
ls Amber there?

25:39.623 --> 25:42.751
You're supposed to be jolting
my hypothalamus. Not petting it.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.045
- We don't want to overload it.
- As long as I'm risking my life,

25:45.170 --> 25:46.880
I might as well
be watching a talkie.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.594
Increasing
from 3 to 5 volts.

25:53.178 --> 25:54.596
Sending impulse.

25:58.141 --> 25:59.351
You're not
getting them back.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.280
Hey! You take my keys,
you gotta give me a phone call.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.792
Who are you calling?

26:24.751 --> 26:26.419
<i>(TELEPHONE RINGING)</i>

26:30.090 --> 26:31.424
Dial-a-Wilson.

26:32.342 --> 26:33.510
I was on call.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.056
(STUTTERS)

26:41.059 --> 26:42.936
Amber was home.

26:43.061 --> 26:47.190
I told her to find you,
have you pick me up.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.042
I said to find Wilson.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.085
He's working.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.838
And I'm willing to suffer this indignity
on his behalf.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.340
WILSON:
Does she seem sick?

27:14.050 --> 27:14.884
Not yet.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.428
Come on, time to go.

27:16.553 --> 27:22.267
Need another round and a drink
for what passes for a lady around here.

27:22.726 --> 27:25.145
- What's your poison?
- Nothing. We're leaving.

27:25.270 --> 27:28.773
We're leaving, leaving, leaving.
Cosmos.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.526
I remember Wilson
buying cranberry juice.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.612
I'll have another,
and she'll have a Cosmopolitan.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.823
The obstinate drunk thing
is not flattering.

27:36.948 --> 27:38.450
Come on,
you called for a ride.

27:39.784 --> 27:43.580
Drink your drink,
or I'll drink them both.

27:44.748 --> 27:49.336
One, and you leave
voluntarily.

27:57.302 --> 27:58.178
Let's go.

27:58.303 --> 28:00.638
Hey!
Need another Cosmo, here.

28:00.764 --> 28:01.931
(SNEEZES)

28:02.974 --> 28:04.434
She sneezed.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.311
What color is it?

28:06.436 --> 28:07.645
Thanks.

28:12.442 --> 28:17.113
Looks like snot.
Seems like a cold.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.909
Nothing else?

28:21.868 --> 28:23.370
No.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.880
Where are
you going?

28:34.005 --> 28:35.256
You think I paid?

28:35.382 --> 28:38.134
House, what are you doing?
You can barely walk.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.553
Go home.
I'll take the bus.

28:40.678 --> 28:44.432
BARTENDER:
Hey, someone's gotta pay for this.

28:48.103 --> 28:49.187
(BURPS)

28:50.605 --> 28:51.731
Hi.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.319
You forgot something.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.115
Boy,
you don't give up, do you?

29:00.240 --> 29:02.117
Yeah, I'm an idiot
that way.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.995
You doing this for me,
or for Wilson?

29:06.121 --> 29:07.747
For Wilson.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.750
Well, then,
it's even more impressive.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.669
(TOASTING IN FRENCH)

29:14.379 --> 29:15.588
(SNEEZES)

29:16.464 --> 29:18.174
Damn.
Do you have a Kleenex?

29:18.299 --> 29:19.676
I got a sleeve.

29:20.218 --> 29:21.302
I got two, actually.

29:21.428 --> 29:24.764
Gonna need more than that.
I'm getting that nasty flu.

29:28.810 --> 29:32.230
Is that it? The flu?
ls there any rare complication?

29:34.399 --> 29:37.610
No. It'll explain the rash,
but nothing else.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.488
Unless...

29:41.281 --> 29:42.574
What?

29:54.294 --> 29:55.587
Don't do it.

30:03.761 --> 30:05.847
It wasn't the flu.

30:05.972 --> 30:10.435
It's what she did for it.
She has amantadine poisoning.

30:11.728 --> 30:13.396
The crash destroyed
her kidneys,

30:13.521 --> 30:14.939
her body couldn't
filter the drugs,

30:15.064 --> 30:18.693
she ODs on amantadine,
explains the heart, the liver...

30:18.818 --> 30:22.489
We just need to start on her dialysis
and flush the drugs out.

30:24.491 --> 30:26.367
What? What's wrong?

30:29.245 --> 30:31.915
Amantadine binds
with proteins.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.584
Dialysis can't clear it
out of the blood.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.633
There's nothing
we can do.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.264
I'm so sorry.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.565
Amber.

31:03.821 --> 31:05.073
Amber.

31:05.782 --> 31:06.824
(CRASHING)

31:06.950 --> 31:07.784
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

31:07.909 --> 31:11.329
He's seizing. Wilson!
I need help, here.

31:13.831 --> 31:16.876
House suffered
a complex partial seizure.

31:17.377 --> 31:21.756
The violent shaking widened his
skull fracture, causing a brain bleed.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.509
<i>FOREMAN: We won't know
if there's any cognitive impairment</i>

31:24.634 --> 31:26.177
<i>until he's out
of the coma.</i>

31:27.136 --> 31:29.222
<i>He was right about
the amantadine.</i>

31:30.348 --> 31:32.308
<i>Amber's body
couldn't filter it out.</i>

31:32.976 --> 31:36.229
<i>That's what caused her heart
to beat too fast for too long.</i>

31:36.771 --> 31:38.690
<i>It caused irreparable
structural damage.</i>

31:40.191 --> 31:43.111
<i>Didn't matter if they shocked her
or froze her or...</i>

31:44.320 --> 31:47.782
<i>Her heart was dead
once it stopped in that ambulance.</i>

31:48.408 --> 31:50.994
What about a new heart?
Transplant?

31:51.494 --> 31:55.164
All of her organs are damaged.
She can't qualify.

31:56.332 --> 31:59.794
There's nothing we can do.
Nothing we could have done.

32:10.388 --> 32:12.056
We should call
time of death.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.060
Technically,
she's still alive.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.896
Could probably survive
a few more hours on bypass.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.775
We could wean her off anesthesia.
Wake her up.

32:22.900 --> 32:23.776
Give you a chance to...

32:23.901 --> 32:25.737
It'd be cruel.
Don't...

32:27.864 --> 32:31.284
Wake Amber up.
See her again.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.912
Tell her what
she means to you.

32:35.038 --> 32:38.124
Wake her up to tell her
that she's...

32:40.877 --> 32:42.045
(CRYING)

32:44.047 --> 32:48.009
You are waking her up so that
you can both say goodbye to each other.

32:49.344 --> 32:50.637
She would want it.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.564
Hey.

33:43.690 --> 33:44.857
Hey.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.196
You're in the hospital.

33:55.493 --> 33:57.036
I'm on bypass.

33:58.329 --> 33:59.414
Yeah.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.126
Do you remember
what happened?

34:03.251 --> 34:04.919
I got on the bus.

34:12.927 --> 34:14.303
I shouldn't have gotten
on the bus.

34:14.429 --> 34:17.598
No. No.
It's not your fault.

34:18.182 --> 34:19.726
It's not your fault.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.269
How bad?

34:23.062 --> 34:27.692
You had tachycardia,
complicated by complete renal failure.

34:29.944 --> 34:36.325
The tachycardia degenerated into V-fib,
followed by hepatic failure.

34:50.715 --> 34:51.966
The flu pills...

34:55.470 --> 34:56.679
Yeah.

35:01.392 --> 35:02.685
I'm dead.

35:06.731 --> 35:08.065
I love you.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.445
I love you, too.

35:16.199 --> 35:17.325
(AMBER CRYING)

35:27.794 --> 35:29.921
We should say goodbye.

35:30.046 --> 35:32.048
She didn't
even like us.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.132
We liked her.

35:34.008 --> 35:35.176
Did we?

35:35.927 --> 35:37.595
We do now.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.015
What do we say?

35:41.140 --> 35:42.809
We don't need to
say anything.

36:26.519 --> 36:28.020
I'm tired.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.862
I think it's time
to go to sleep.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.031
Just a little longer.

36:40.575 --> 36:45.037
We're always gonna want
just a little longer.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.167
I don't think
I can do it.

36:55.923 --> 36:57.174
It's okay.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.134
It's not okay.

36:58.259 --> 37:01.554
Why is it okay with you?
Why aren't you angry?

37:05.516 --> 37:10.396
That's not
the last feeling

37:11.314 --> 37:13.441
I want to experience.

37:46.974 --> 37:47.975
(GASPING)

38:08.412 --> 38:09.747
BP stable.

38:09.872 --> 38:11.791
Still non-responsive.

38:11.916 --> 38:13.751
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

38:13.876 --> 38:16.045
Heart rate's normal.

38:18.339 --> 38:22.093
<i>Respiratory rate
is...</i>

38:39.110 --> 38:40.194
You're dead.

38:41.070 --> 38:42.488
Everybody dies.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.116
Am I dead?

38:51.580 --> 38:52.748
Not yet.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.209
I should be.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.168
Why?

38:56.293 --> 38:59.005
Because life
shouldn't be random.

38:59.505 --> 39:03.551
Because lonely, misanthropic
drug addicts should die in bus crashes,

39:03.676 --> 39:07.221
and young do-gooders in love
who get dragged out of their apartment

39:07.346 --> 39:10.099
in the middle of the night
should walk away clean.

39:10.725 --> 39:12.685
Self-pity
isn't like you.

39:13.853 --> 39:17.231
I'm branching out from
self-loathing and self-destruction.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.193
Wilson is going to hate me.

39:23.738 --> 39:25.281
You kind of deserve it.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.079
He's my best friend.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.372
I know.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.460
What now?

39:39.503 --> 39:41.213
I stay here with you.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.840
Get off the bus.

39:46.469 --> 39:48.387
- I can't.
- Why not?

39:48.512 --> 39:50.306
Because...

39:51.682 --> 39:53.184
(CHUCKLES)

39:56.228 --> 39:58.439
Because it doesn't
hurt here.

40:02.443 --> 40:03.736
I lied.

40:04.236 --> 40:08.282
I don't want to be in pain
and I don't want to be miserable.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.453
And I don't want him
to hate me.

40:16.123 --> 40:20.044
Well...
You can't always get what you want.

40:52.993 --> 40:56.330
Hey. I'm here.

40:58.082 --> 41:00.167
Blink if you can hear me.

41:02.169 --> 41:03.003
(SIGHING)

41:04.380 --> 41:06.590
No.
Don't try to talk.

41:07.383 --> 41:08.843
Just rest.
