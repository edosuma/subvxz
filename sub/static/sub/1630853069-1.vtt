I didn't sign up

Weeks we've been out here
with nothing to show for it.

20 kills by now,
at least.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.492
Very perilous!

01:16.910 --> 01:18.912
Some of us won't be coming back.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.707
Others may be wounded.

01:22.791 --> 01:26.002
Still others may come back
looking totally fine...

01:26.085 --> 01:27.462
but in reality,

01:27.545 --> 01:31.424
be mentally devastated
by what they've witnessed.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.136
So... if that's the case,
what'll we do?

01:37.055 --> 01:37.096

01:38.389 --> 01:39.766
C'mon!

01:39.849 --> 01:42.268
Something I've
always encouraged.

No, Frenchie!

01:44.854 --> 01:47.649

-No? Sorry.

Captain Stede:
Some men are born
to be pirate captains.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.645
Others learn on the job.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.646
Watch my buttons!

03:08.730 --> 03:12.025
Me? Well, I'm a pretty
solid mix of both.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.610
Yes!

happened here today!

-Fisherman:
Take care of the plant.
-Adios!

03:18.364 --> 03:19.699
Good luck with your fishing!

03:25.371 --> 03:26.873
Really fills the space,
doesn't it?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.583
Yeah... it's fine.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.919
Now, where was I?

03:31.002 --> 03:33.838
Um... being
a pirate captain.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.758
Ah, yes.
Now, every pirate captain

03:36.841 --> 03:39.218
captains pirates differently.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.849
Traditionally, piracy
is a culture of abuse--

03:44.933 --> 03:47.769
floggings, keelhaulings.

03:47.852 --> 03:51.022
And my thought is, "Why?"

03:51.105 --> 03:54.776
And also, what if
it weren't like that?

03:54.859 --> 03:57.946
For example, if your
average pirate doesn't
steal, he doesn't eat.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.907
That's a lot
of mental pressure.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.952
So... I pay
my crew a salary.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.454
Same wage every week,
no matter what.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.248
Course, it took them
a while to come
'round to the idea,

04:09.332 --> 04:13.252
but I've included some
amenities on the ship that
I think will please them.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.923
Rec center.

04:17.006 --> 04:20.510
-Pirate 1: Out!
-Pirate 2: What is this
fuckin' game?! Fuck!

04:20.593 --> 04:22.136
State-of-the-art en suite.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.472
-(animals bleating)
-Non-humans.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.474
The ballroom.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.313
-Jam room.
-(pirates drumming)

04:32.397 --> 04:35.316
And, of course,
a full library.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.317
The crew is free
to borrow books whenever.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.237
So far, you're the only
one to take me up on it.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.321
Well, I'm the only
crew member who can read.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.575
That's not--
Is that true?

04:44.909 --> 04:46.327
Ooh.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.329
All right, come on.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.501
Here it is.
The spoils of battle!

04:53.584 --> 04:55.003
Woo-hoo.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.338
-Congratulations
on today's raid.
-Big wow.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.339
I do have some
notes, though.

04:58.423 --> 05:02.260
Uh, opening speech went well.
Very inspiring.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.220
Uh, oh, yes,
I guess the big note

05:04.303 --> 05:05.847
is more energy!

05:05.930 --> 05:08.307
We're swashbuckling,
we're looting.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.519
-Let's have fun with it.
-Stealing a plant is
hardly swashbuckling.

05:11.602 --> 05:15.356
-(Roach laughs)
-A feckin' disgrace,
is what it is.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.524
What was that?

05:16.607 --> 05:18.651
Who said that?

05:18.735 --> 05:21.195
-Wee John, was that you?
-And what it if were?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.240
Well, I'd...

05:24.323 --> 05:28.036
I'd simply ask you to,
uh, reframe that criticism

05:28.119 --> 05:29.370
as a suggestion.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.706
What's one thing
you'd change around here
if you could?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.624
Well, we don't even
have a flag, for one.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.792
-Pirates: Yeah.
-Oh.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.669
Any pirate worth
a damn has a flag.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.545
-Mm.
-Roach: That's true.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.589
The Swede:
That's right.
They have flags.

05:39.672 --> 05:44.886
Oy! Now, each of you
will create a flag.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.721
And we'll vote
for the best one,

05:46.804 --> 05:48.723
and that will be
the official flag for
"The Revenge."

05:48.806 --> 05:50.725
I'm not fuckin' sewing.

05:50.808 --> 05:54.103
-That's women's work.
-Oh, Black Pete, come on now.

05:54.187 --> 05:54.687
You know that's not true.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.066
How many of you sew?

05:58.149 --> 06:00.651
-Be honest.
-Sewed my shoulder up once...

06:00.735 --> 06:02.945
-after I'd been stabbed.
-(all gasp)

06:03.029 --> 06:04.655
Captain Stede:
Oh! Did you hear that, guys?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.407
Roach sewed
his own arm up!

06:06.491 --> 06:08.242
Sounds to me
like sewing can
be pretty tough.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.579
So, grab a piece of fabric
and have at it!

06:11.662 --> 06:12.872
Express yourselves.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.420
(lively classical music playing)

06:22.381 --> 06:24.550
-Oh, that's very good.
-Oluwande: Oh, thank you.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.387
-Captain Stede: What is it?
-It's like a flag extender...

06:27.470 --> 06:28.846
-Right.
-...so it flaps.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.015
-Oh, it'll blow in the wind?
Interesting, okay.
-Yeah.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.309
-Do you like mine?
-Wee John Feeney:
That's such beautiful material.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.394
Captain Stede:
Well, don't you look holy.

06:35.478 --> 06:39.565
Oh, thank you.
I used to make dresses
with my mother.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.109
And now,
you're a pirate.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.276
A lot of the guys are
sweethearts deep down.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.573
Hoy, hoy!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Break it up!

06:47.657 --> 06:48.574
Swede, get off of him!

06:48.658 --> 06:49.158
They're just dealing with

06:49.242 --> 06:51.077
a fair amount of trauma.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.954
So, first of all,
you should've asked,

06:53.037 --> 06:54.413
and, second of all...

06:54.497 --> 06:57.125
what could you do
with your large
bit of fabric?

06:57.542 --> 06:58.960
Talk about it?

06:59.043 --> 07:02.880
-No, shared!
You could've shared it.
-Oh.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.051
Captain Stede:
Creative projects give them
a chance to work through it.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.304
And maybe even share a bit
of what's going on inside.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.515
Well, guess it's time.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.269
-For what?
-To kill Captain.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.566
Hey, come on, mate.
I'm gonna have
to sew that up now.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.318
Black Pete:
Sorry... sorry.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.195
If I can help
this crew grow,

07:26.279 --> 07:27.488
as people,

07:27.572 --> 07:30.992
then I've succeeded
in being a pirate captain.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.243
A word, Cap'n?

07:32.326 --> 07:34.370
Oh, yes, Mr. Buttons.

07:34.453 --> 07:36.455
What's on your mind?
Everything good?

07:37.415 --> 07:40.376
Everythin' is not good.

07:40.459 --> 07:41.836
Mutiny is a-brewin'.

07:41.919 --> 07:42.378
Mutiny?
(laughs)

07:46.215 --> 07:48.676
-Really?
-Been on many a ship
'n the nose never lies.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.096
-Stop writing!
-Stop--

07:52.180 --> 07:54.015
I mean it!

07:54.098 --> 07:55.349
-Lucius!
-Sorry, I'm confused.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.018
You said
to record everything,
warts and all,

07:57.101 --> 07:59.437
-so that's what I'm doin'.
-Well, not this!

07:59.520 --> 08:00.771
Just go for a walk.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.732
(light harpsichord playing)

08:05.902 --> 08:09.780
You think
Blackbeard's crew sews?
No.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.366
We were too busy killing.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.327
Or, or drinking.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.204
And when we weren't
killing or drinking,

08:16.287 --> 08:19.540
we were plotting or scheming,

08:19.624 --> 08:22.376
or... or just, generally,
being badasses.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.046
You never sailed
with Blackbeard.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.924
Hey, could you pass
the black thread,
pretty please?

08:28.007 --> 08:30.218
Cheers, me dears.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.260
Roach:
What is that?
A, a cat?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.930
The flag's supposed
to be scary.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.515
Yeah, cats are terrifying.
Everyone knows that.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.558
'Cause they're witches.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.935
And they've got
knives in their feet.

08:39.018 --> 08:39.769
Black Pete:
Can we forget
about the flags

08:39.852 --> 08:41.687
for a second,
and focus on the mutiny?

08:41.771 --> 08:44.232
Mutiny or no, we're gonna need
a scary flag aren't we, so--

08:44.315 --> 08:47.235
Look, the point is...
we should be pillaging!

08:47.318 --> 08:50.238
-Pirates: Mm-hm.
-Black Pete: The current
management's gotta go.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.365
Who's with me?

08:52.448 --> 08:55.076
If we can light him
on fire... I'm in.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.619
That's one.
Who else?

08:59.830 --> 09:02.250
Hey, guys, so, um...
Buttons told him.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.919
-(all groan)
-Goddammit!

09:05.002 --> 09:07.880
Um, I'm still in,
by the way.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.215
Mutiny?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.843
Really?
I... I can't believe it.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.637
Why?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.098
I wouldn't
take it personal.

09:17.181 --> 09:17.932
It's just that
they don't like ye.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.351
-Or the way that ye do things.
-Hmm.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.562
I'm supportive, caring.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.647
-Responsive to their needs.
-Buttons: See, that

09:24.730 --> 09:28.985
may be what's
contributin' to the poor
overall impression.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.445
What is the overall impression?

09:33.155 --> 09:36.409
That yer weak...
soft-bellied, yella.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.203
-I see.
-Craven, ill-equipped
to lead men.

09:39.287 --> 09:39.495
Understood!

09:41.205 --> 09:43.457
Thank you.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.459
What I'm hearing is they
could do with more structure.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.547
-Perhaps, a firmer hand?
-Or an iron fist.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.882
Give 'em somethin'
to really stick
their teeth inta.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.384
Make them
earn their keep.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.885
Know what I'm sayin'?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.012
I get it.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.097
Toughen up.

09:59.223 --> 10:02.768
Question, who's gonna be
captain if we kill Captain?

10:02.852 --> 10:03.477
Black Pete:
We vote on it.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.314
And... then
it will be me

10:06.397 --> 10:08.107
'cause I'm
the most experienced.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.483
-(Pirate chuckles)
-Fucking no, no, no, no, no.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.695
How 'bout Jim?
He looks experienced.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.656
Well, he's a mute,
for one, which seems...

10:16.991 --> 10:19.076
problematic in a leader.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.536
No offense.
I know you're mates.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.414
Oh, no, none taken.
It's true.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.334
Besides, Jim's not too keen
on politics anyway, so.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.258
Captain Stede:
Ooh, how 'bout that one?
Is that big?

10:34.342 --> 10:36.802
Aye, hard to say for certain,

10:36.886 --> 10:39.889
but... I expect
she's our beauty.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.932
Good, all right.
Should we go for that one?

10:42.850 --> 10:44.727
It's the only one
I can really see.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.188
Let's do it.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.148
What about you, Oluwande?
In or out?

10:50.358 --> 10:52.943
Well, I don't really have
a problem with the Captain.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.362
He reads us stories at night.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.280
That's one nice
thing about him.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.865
If we kill him, we'll
never know what happens

10:57.948 --> 10:59.867
to the wooden doll who
wants to become a real boy.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.535
-Pirates: Aww.
-Oluwande: None of us can read.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.537
Lucius reads.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.373
But can he do the voices?

11:05.456 --> 11:08.042
-Captain does the voices.
-Roach: Talk like a wooden boy.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.919
-Do the, uh, the boy voice.
-Oh, no, that's okay.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.545
(all chattering)

11:11.629 --> 11:14.173
-Do the wooden boy voice.
-Do the wooden boy voice!

11:14.256 --> 11:16.175
(high-pitched):
Oh, hello.
I'm a little wooden boy,

11:16.258 --> 11:18.386
and me, me legs
are sticks.

11:18.469 --> 11:18.594
(clears throat)

11:21.972 --> 11:22.723
Christ, that was awful.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.725
-He's not the captain.
-Terrible...

11:24.809 --> 11:26.769
Avast ye!

11:28.312 --> 11:29.855
Now, listen up!

11:29.939 --> 11:33.109
I gather some of you
feel as though we're
not real pirates.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.737
Well, here's
the deal, buckos.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.741
We have our eyes on a ship.
A big one.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.369
That's right.
A whopper.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.496
And we're goin'
to catch up
with it forthwith,

11:45.579 --> 11:47.373
and kick its ass.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.541
So, any questions?

11:48.624 --> 11:51.210
Is it really a big
ship this time?

11:51.293 --> 11:53.838
-Yes, I just said it was--
-I'm not asking you,
I'm asking him.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.464
Oh.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.175
She is quite
impressive, aye.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.593
But can we
light it on fire?

11:59.677 --> 12:01.429
I'd be disappointed
if we didn't.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.722
-Yes!

to murder ye, Captain.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.294
Uh, Mr. Buttons...

12:33.377 --> 12:35.754
You don't think it'll actually
get that bloody, do you?

12:35.838 --> 12:41.218
Well, it's hard to tell.
Raids are like snowflakes.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.386
No two quite alike?

12:42.470 --> 12:46.390
Well, no, they almost always
end in terrible bloodshed.

20:36.276 --> 20:36.318
Oh!

20:41.782 --> 20:43.784
Row, Baby Bonnet! Row!

20:43.867 --> 20:44.910
(grunts)

20:47.037 --> 20:49.039
(Captain Badminton chuckling)

20:49.122 --> 20:51.291
Oh, it was all
in good fun, of course.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.793
An initiation of sorts.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.630
Yes, funny, I don't recall
it happening to anyone else.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.507
Captain Badminton:
Oh, and there was
the time with the horse!

20:58.590 --> 21:01.385
When we made you
French kiss the horse.
Do you remember?

21:01.468 --> 21:03.136
-(laughter)
-Captain Stede: Right, well,
this has been quite a blast,

21:03.220 --> 21:06.056
but I'm sure you're busy
with all your things,

21:06.139 --> 21:08.141
the King, and the Navy,
and all that.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.978
Not really, no.
It's terribly boring
being at sea.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.480
I mean, how many pirate crews

21:13.563 --> 21:15.774
can one obliterate before it
becomes a bit of a chore?

21:15.857 --> 21:19.569
-(Captain Badminton laughs)
-Well, this has been
fun and all, but, uh...

21:19.653 --> 21:21.655
-we're actually on a bit of
a tight schedule, aren't we?
-Ah, Stede...

21:21.738 --> 21:23.824
a darling little
ship you've got.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.993
(chuckles)
It's so...

21:26.702 --> 21:28.370
efficient and...

21:29.454 --> 21:32.332
tiny. (chuckles)
I'd love to see
the rest of it.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.586
(sighs)

21:37.754 --> 21:38.839
Would you like a tour?

21:38.922 --> 21:41.842
Yes, I would! Wonderful.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.844
We really should
be getting back--

21:43.927 --> 21:46.179
Oh, keep your
pants on, Wellington.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.433
We'll be back on our
smelly old ship soon enough.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.019
No, really.
Smells of ass and runny
cheese on that thing.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.812
Oh, I bet it does.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.695
Good God.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.030
Quite something, isn't it?

22:03.113 --> 22:06.366
It is absolutely ridiculous.

22:06.450 --> 22:11.538
(laughs)
I mean, who brings
an entire library to sea?

22:11.621 --> 22:13.165
Baby Bonnet, that's who.

22:13.248 --> 22:17.794
Oh, it's so perfectly you.
It's so impractical.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.755
I mean, what if
there's a storm?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.506
Don't all
the books fall out?

22:21.590 --> 22:23.633
-(thunder rumbling)
-(yelling)

22:25.177 --> 22:26.595
We've managed so far.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.556
To think of the ridiculous
rumor going around about you.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.683
-(laughs)
-Oh?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.060
What's that rumor?

22:33.143 --> 22:35.896
It's so silly, so outlandish.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.439
Go on.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.235
The rumor is...
(chuckles)

22:42.319 --> 22:45.238
that you left
your wife and children...

22:48.742 --> 22:53.246
-Ah.
-...upended your entire
comfortable life...

22:53.330 --> 22:55.791
Which is your favorite
of all the horses?

22:55.874 --> 22:57.334
Halifax.
Very pretty and very fast.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.420
-Yes, he's wonderful.
-I like Arthur.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.672
He has kind eyes.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.469
And which is your favorite pig?

23:09.805 --> 23:12.599
To become... a pirate.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.434
(both laughing)

23:15.811 --> 23:16.895
Oh...

23:18.188 --> 23:20.107
I mean... it's true.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.448
(laughing)

23:30.033 --> 23:32.035
(laughing)

23:32.119 --> 23:33.578
-Captain Badminton: No!
-Yeah!

23:33.662 --> 23:35.914
(laughing)

23:38.917 --> 23:42.963
You can't!
Oh, Baby Bonnet,
you do tickle me.

23:43.046 --> 23:43.922
(continues laughing)

23:44.005 --> 23:47.884
(tense music playing)

23:53.140 --> 23:55.225
(gun clicks)

23:55.308 --> 23:59.062
Ah... look at this.
Is this a pillowcase?

23:59.146 --> 24:00.272
Officer Wellington:
What on Earth is that?

24:00.355 --> 24:02.941
-Just a, a flag...
-Yeah.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.152
from some pirates we met...

24:06.361 --> 24:08.113
-...and killed.
-Why's one skull
eating the other?

24:08.196 --> 24:10.740
(gasps)
Were they c-cannibals?

24:11.741 --> 24:14.077
Who can say?
All I know is...

24:14.161 --> 24:15.704
I wouldn't mess
with those guys.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.331
They were super tough.
With a flag like that? Please.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.375
Ah! And this?
(chuckles)

24:20.458 --> 24:23.628
-Pirates as well?
-Oh yeah...

24:23.712 --> 24:25.505
Those guys were
even tougher.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.507
No, they weren't.
Doesn't even make sense.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.009
He's holding
his own head.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.385
-That's terrifying.
-(gasps) Skulls!

24:30.468 --> 24:34.806
-More skulls!
-Ooh, this one's vomiting
buttons onto a skeleton.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.808
-(laughing)
-No more buttons.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.602
Ahh!

24:38.685 --> 24:41.938
I'm crying.
(laughing)

24:42.022 --> 24:44.399
-I'm sorry.
-It's not that ridiculous.

24:44.482 --> 24:50.363
(laughing)
Oh, it is. Oh, it is.

24:50.447 --> 24:55.911
Baby Bonnet became
a big, bad pirate.
(laughs)

24:57.204 --> 25:01.041
But you were so fat...
and soft and weak.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.001
-I thought I was slender.
-No, no, no, no.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.128
No, I recall you were a plumper.

25:05.212 --> 25:08.590
And you cried all the time,
and liked to pick flowers.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.969
-(softly): A little bit.
-Officer Hornberry:
Get ready.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.430
-Meow.
-(scattered laughter)

25:15.513 --> 25:19.684
Truly, you've tangled
with some fearsome outlaws.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.897
Actually, everyone knows
cats are very evil because
they steal children's breath.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.565
Enough interruptions, slave!

25:25.649 --> 25:29.527
Your captain may
suffer uppity behavior,
but not me!

25:29.611 --> 25:30.987
(shatters)

25:35.408 --> 25:37.577
(shuddering gasps)

25:38.578 --> 25:38.662
(laughing)

25:40.747 --> 25:41.831
(screaming)

25:43.375 --> 25:44.584
Oh my god!

25:46.169 --> 25:48.129
Fuck it!

25:48.213 --> 25:50.340
-(gunshot)
-(muffled shouting)

25:50.423 --> 25:51.424
Did you hear that?

25:51.508 --> 25:54.552
Uh, no.
I didn't hear anything.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.638
-We're under attack.
-Just wait, it might blow over.

25:59.808 --> 26:04.229
Still a coward.
Pathetic.

26:04.312 --> 26:08.233
(echoing):
Pathetic. Pathetic.
Pathetic. Pathetic...

26:10.986 --> 26:12.237
-(clanks)
-Gah!

26:14.656 --> 26:15.740
(squishing)

26:15.824 --> 26:16.116
Ah!

26:16.199 --> 26:18.910
(shouting)

26:18.994 --> 26:21.204
Captain Stede:
Hello? Excuse me?

26:21.288 --> 26:24.416
You guys, I need
a hand with something...

26:24.499 --> 26:24.958
in my room.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.627
Quickly! Please!

26:32.090 --> 26:34.634
I used the stun move.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.679
Lucius:
Yeah, no, he, he
looks pretty stunned.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.475
Oh my god. Oh my god.
It was just an accident.

26:42.559 --> 26:45.312
-This is not happening. No.
-Oluwande: Hey.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.980
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-No.

26:47.063 --> 26:50.608
This is happening, okay?
Do you want to live?

26:50.692 --> 26:52.986
-That's a tough question.
-I said, "Do you want to live?"

26:53.069 --> 26:54.154
I think so! Probably!

26:54.237 --> 26:55.405
Well, pull yourself
together then.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.782
Yeah, because everyone
up there wants you dead!

26:57.866 --> 27:02.203
-It's true.
-Now, do you want
the respect of your crew?

27:02.287 --> 27:04.331
-That would be nice.
-Then this was
no accident. Okay?

27:04.414 --> 27:07.083
You did this intentionally.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.501
-Right.
-On purpose.

27:08.585 --> 27:09.502
On purpose.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.713
(all exclaiming)

27:14.257 --> 27:15.550
Uh... I did this.

27:17.552 --> 27:21.389
-On purpose.
-Stabbed him right in the face.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.351
-Respect.
-You'll never leave
here alive, pirate scum!

27:24.434 --> 27:28.104
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
What now, Captain?

27:28.188 --> 27:30.482
Throw 'em overboard?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.109
No.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.194
Get some rope.

27:34.277 --> 27:37.947
All right, come on.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.576
They're, they're leaving?
Where's Captain?

27:43.787 --> 27:44.662
There he is.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.500
(whimpering)

27:50.251 --> 27:51.753
(screams)

27:57.634 --> 28:00.553
Do you know how hard
it is to drive a sword
through someone's skull?

28:00.637 --> 28:03.390
(chuckles)
It's always the quiet ones.

28:03.473 --> 28:05.934
I thought that
was fairly badass.

28:06.017 --> 28:10.772
-You got to admit,
he pulled it off.
-Pulled what off?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.316
Making us dress up like
a bunch of fancy boys?

28:13.400 --> 28:16.569
Ah, come on.
At least we got
some hostages, huh?

28:16.653 --> 28:18.696
(all laughing)

28:20.532 --> 28:24.369
It won't hurt to give
him another day.

28:24.452 --> 28:25.578
We can always kill
him the day after.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.333
Lucius:
He's a terrible captain.

28:32.085 --> 28:35.088
We're not exactly
the best crew though,
are we?

28:35.171 --> 28:36.589
Besides,
as long as he's around,

28:36.673 --> 28:37.632
we're gonna
be paid, fed,

28:37.715 --> 28:39.592
and we don't even
have to work too hard.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.597
He'll be dead soon.
We might as well
enjoy it while it lasts.

28:47.642 --> 28:49.269
Would you rather be
captained by that?

28:49.352 --> 28:51.563
(taunting the hostages)

28:52.564 --> 28:53.106
(disgusted groan)

28:53.189 --> 28:55.400
Exactly.
