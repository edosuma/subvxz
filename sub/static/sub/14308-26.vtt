WEBVTT

00:09.367 --> 00:12.233
- ONE MORE TWIST, AND...

00:12.267 --> 00:14.333
DONE.
HA!

00:14.367 --> 00:17.267
WHO NEEDS A HANDYMAN
WHEN YOU HAVE A HANDYMOM?

00:17.300 --> 00:19.433
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.133
- I NEED A HANDYMAN.

00:23.167 --> 00:26.200
- MOM, I NEED THIS NEW TABLET
THAT JUST CAME OUT.

00:26.233 --> 00:27.467
IT'S CALLED A FABULET.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.700
ON THE ONE HAND
IT DOES COST

00:28.733 --> 00:30.367
TWICE AS MUCH
AS A REGULAR TABLET,

00:30.400 --> 00:32.333
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:32.367 --> 00:33.600
- OH.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.133
TAYLOR, JUST LAST MONTH
YOU "HAD"

00:35.167 --> 00:36.533
TO HAVE
THAT EXPENSIVE PAIR OF JEANS

00:36.567 --> 00:38.133
THAT YOU ONLY WORE ONCE.

00:38.167 --> 00:40.200
- THEY WENT OUT OF STYLE
VERY QUICKLY.

00:40.233 --> 00:43.100
- PLEASE, I HAVE WORN
THE SAME PAIR OF JEANS

00:43.133 --> 00:45.167
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS,

00:45.200 --> 00:46.433
AND THEY'RE STILL HAPPENING.

00:46.467 --> 00:49.167
YEAH.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.333
- WELL, IF YOU WANT A FABULET,
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND

00:51.367 --> 00:52.700
A WAY TO PAY FOR IT
YOURSELF.

00:52.733 --> 00:54.833
- I DO HAVE A WAY
TO PAY FOR IT.

00:54.867 --> 00:57.267
YOU.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.467
LAME.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.600
BORING.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.567
LOUIE?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.867
- YEP.
THAT'S RIGHT, FRANKIE.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.367
AND IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR LIVING ROOM

01:04.400 --> 01:05.900
WEATHER FORECAST.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.067
- CURRENT COUCH CONDITIONS ARE
A BALMY 81 DEGREES

01:11.100 --> 01:14.167
WITH A 100% CHANCE
OF SYRUP.

01:25.233 --> 01:27.767
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT!

01:27.800 --> 01:30.167
WELL, NOW WE'RE EVEN.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.733
WHAT DID I DO?

01:32.767 --> 01:35.233
- SURELY, YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
WHAT WILL FOREVER

01:35.267 --> 01:38.200
BE KNOWN AS "THE INSULT."

01:43.467 --> 01:44.600
HEY.

01:44.633 --> 01:47.633
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

01:49.500 --> 01:52.300
FRANKIE!

01:56.667 --> 01:58.700
- NO ONE DISRESPECTS
LOUIE PRESTON

01:58.733 --> 02:01.200
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.900
- YES, THEY DO.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.800
- STARTING NOW.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.767
- LOUIE, YOU LEAVE ME
NO CHOICE

02:06.800 --> 02:08.167
BUT TO SEEK REVENGE.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.167
- I'M THE GHOST, SWEETHEART.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.700
I'LL DO THE INTIMIDATING.

02:15.433 --> 02:18.733
I THINK I MADE MY POINT.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.567
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:27.600 --> 02:30.433
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:30.467 --> 02:32.533
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:32.567 --> 02:36.500
both: * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:36.533 --> 02:38.733
* DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:38.767 --> 02:40.367
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:40.400 --> 02:43.233
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:43.267 --> 02:46.100
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:46.133 --> 02:48.167
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:48.200 --> 02:51.733
*

02:51.767 --> 02:53.767
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:53.800 --> 02:55.567
*

03:02.700 --> 03:04.533
FIVE SHAMPOOS LATER
AND I STILL HAVE

03:04.567 --> 03:06.100
SYRUP IN MY HAIR.

03:06.133 --> 03:07.467
- GOOD TO KNOW.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.133
I'LL CHANGE YOUR EVENING
FORECAST

03:09.167 --> 03:12.100
TO "PARTLY STICKY."

03:12.133 --> 03:15.267
- I'LL SHOW YOU PARTLY STICKY.

03:20.667 --> 03:21.800
- OOPS.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.500
DID YOU FORGET?
I'M A GHOST.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.567
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.733
CAN'T TOUCH ME.

03:30.767 --> 03:34.167
- THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY
I CAN GET BACK AT YOU.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.533
- IMPOSSIBLE.

03:35.567 --> 03:38.333
THE L-TRAIN FEARS NO PERSON.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.533
- AAHHH!

03:41.567 --> 03:44.567
GHOST HUNTER!

03:52.567 --> 03:54.433
- NOT MUCH.
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

03:54.467 --> 03:57.200
- NO, I LITERALLY MEANT
"WHAT ARE YOU COOKING?"

03:57.233 --> 03:59.400
- DAD AND I ARE WORKING
ON THIS YEAR'S ENTRY

03:59.433 --> 04:02.200
FOR THE TASTE OF NEW ORLEANS
GUMBO CONTEST.

04:02.233 --> 04:04.567
- HOW DO GHOSTS ENTER
A FOOD CONTEST?

04:04.600 --> 04:06.167
- EVERY YEAR WE SUBMIT
OUR GUMBO

04:06.200 --> 04:08.233
UNDER THE FAKE NAME
"CRAWDADDY."

04:08.267 --> 04:09.700
- THE FACT
THAT NO ONE'S EVER SEEN US

04:09.733 --> 04:11.233
ADDS TO OUR MYSTIQUE.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.600
- MILES AND RAY HAVE WON
TWO YEARS IN A ROW.

04:13.633 --> 04:14.633
I THINK IT'S TWO YEARS
IN A ROW.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.133
I CAN'T REMEMBER BECAUSE

04:16.167 --> 04:18.667
THEY'VE ONLY TOLD ME
57 TIMES.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.300
- IT'S TWO YEARS IN A ROW.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.100
AND AFTER TOMORROW

04:22.133 --> 04:23.300
YOU CAN MAKE THAT THREE.

04:23.333 --> 04:24.600
- AND WITH THE PRIZE MONEY,

04:24.633 --> 04:26.467
I'M GONNA BUY
A VERY RARE COMIC BOOK--

04:26.500 --> 04:29.833
DAPPER DAN:
SUPER SPY, SNAPPY DRESSER.

04:29.867 --> 04:31.767
YOU KNOW, THEY ONLY
MADE ONE ISSUE.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.333
- SHOCKING.

04:35.367 --> 04:37.100
SO THIS PRIZE MONEY--
IS IT ENOUGH TO BUY,

04:37.133 --> 04:38.567
I DON'T KNOW,
A BRAND-NEW FABULET

04:38.600 --> 04:41.200
WITH A TERABYTE DRIVE
IN A HOT PINK GLITTER CASE?

04:41.233 --> 04:43.500
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND MOST
OF THOSE WORDS,

04:43.533 --> 04:45.800
BUT IT'S $1,000.

04:45.833 --> 04:49.367
- HOT MAMA,
WE'RE MAKING GUMBO!

04:49.400 --> 04:51.100
- TAYLOR, YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT MAKING GUMBO.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.733
- THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.733
- TAYLOR, I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT MAKING GUMBO.

04:54.767 --> 04:57.100
- MOM, YOU ALWAYS SAY
WE DON'T HAVE

04:57.133 --> 04:58.300
ENOUGH MOTHER-DAUGHTER TIME.

04:58.333 --> 04:59.500
- HMM, THAT'S TRUE.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.867
AND EXPERTS DO SAY
THE TEEN YEARS

05:00.900 --> 05:02.233
ARE CRUCIAL
PARENT CHILD BONDING--

05:02.267 --> 05:04.600
- LESS TALKIE,
MORE COOK-IE!

05:06.767 --> 05:08.833
MAKING GUMBO IS A DELICATE ART.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.633
IT TAKES YEARS TO EVEN--

05:10.667 --> 05:13.100
- OH! FOUND A RECIPE.

05:13.133 --> 05:14.767
- A REAL CAJUN DOESN'T NEED
A RECIPE.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.267
HE COOKS FROM HIS SOUL.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.267
- THAT'S SWEET--
COULD YOU TELL YOUR SOUL

05:17.300 --> 05:18.467
TO PUT A LID ON IT,

05:18.500 --> 05:19.533
SO WE CAN CONCENTRATE
OVER HERE?

05:21.867 --> 05:24.600
- OH.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.867
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA WIN.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.733
WE HAVE
A SPECIAL SECRET INGREDIENT

05:28.767 --> 05:30.533
YOU WON'T FIND
IN ANY GROCERY STORE.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.767
- PFFT, LIKE WE NEED
SOME SECRET INGREDIENT.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.167
MOM, CAN I SEE YOU
IN THE BAKERY?

05:34.200 --> 05:37.400
WE NEED
SOME SECRET INGREDIENT.

05:37.433 --> 05:39.600
- WE HAVE
A SECRET INGREDIENT, SWEETIE.

05:39.633 --> 05:42.633
THE POWER
OF MOTHER-DAUGHTER BONDING.

05:42.667 --> 05:45.067
- WE'RE DOOMED.

05:47.067 --> 05:49.800
- SO I NEED HELP
GETTING REVENGE ON A GHOST,

05:49.833 --> 05:52.067
AND YOU ARE A GHOST EXPERT.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.733
- I CAN HELP YOU.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.467
COME TO MY SHACK IN THE SWAMP.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.133
I'VE GOT ALL KIND
OF THINGS

05:57.167 --> 05:59.233
YOU WON'T FIND
IN AN ORDINARY STORE.

05:59.267 --> 06:00.400
MY CARD.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.767
- "MADAME LEBUEF'S SWAMP SHACK.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.333
"I'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF THINGS

06:04.367 --> 06:07.400
YOU WON'T FIND
IN AN ORDINARY STORE."

06:07.433 --> 06:09.733
- EXCUSE ME,
I HATE TO BUTT IN,

06:09.767 --> 06:10.800
BUT...

06:13.300 --> 06:15.167
ANY CHANCE YOU SELL
ANYTHING THAT COULD ADD

06:15.200 --> 06:16.767
A LITTLE KICK
TO A POT OF GUMBO?

06:16.800 --> 06:18.867
SAY, SOME SECRET INGREDIENT?

06:18.900 --> 06:22.433
- OOH, I'VE GOT
A WHOLE SECTION OF 'EM.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.633
HERE'S A COUPON FOR 10% OFF.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.267
- THIS IS FOR A CAR WASH.

06:26.300 --> 06:29.200
- DO YOU WANT THE DISCOUNT
OR NOT?

06:29.233 --> 06:31.167
- FRANKIE,
GRAB YOUR BUG REPELLENT.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.567
WE'RE GOING TO THE BAYOU.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.667
WHAT DOES ONE WEAR TO A SWAMP?

06:34.700 --> 06:36.167
- COULD BE DEEP WATER.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.400
WE'LL NEED
SOMETHING HIGH-WAISTED

06:37.433 --> 06:39.067
THAT WE DON'T
MIND DESTROYING.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.567
both: MOM'S JEANS.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.167
- THIS PLACE GIVES ME
THE CREEPS.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.467
WHAT WAS THAT?

06:50.700 --> 06:52.100
IT WAS EITHER AN ALLIGATOR

06:52.133 --> 06:53.500
OR A FAMILY OF VENOMOUS
WATER MOCCASINS.

06:54.533 --> 06:58.633
ALLIGATOR.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.200
- WATCH YOUR STEP.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.800
THIS SHOP IS EVEN FREAKIER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.300
- I KNOW.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.167
I WONDER IF THEY DO
BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.867
- I DO.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.767
EVER PLAYED RING TOSS
WITH A RAM'S SKULL?

07:27.800 --> 07:31.533
- I...LOVE...HER.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.800
- OKAY GIRLS,
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

07:33.833 --> 07:36.833
I'VE GOT SPELLS, SPICES,

07:36.867 --> 07:38.800
TOAD STEW,

07:38.833 --> 07:40.067
AND, STARTING NEXT MONTH,

07:40.067 --> 07:42.067
PILATES ON THE PORCH.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.067
- I WANT REVENGE ON A GHOST.
- GOOD.

07:45.067 --> 07:48.300
BECAUSE THE TOAD'S
A LITTLE UNDERCOOKED.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.800
- PERHAPS YOU'D BE INTERESTED
IN THIS.

07:53.833 --> 07:56.700
- A MAGICAL VOODOO DOLL.

07:56.733 --> 08:00.233
IF I MAKE ONE IN
YOUR GHOST'S IMAGE,

08:00.267 --> 08:02.400
ANYTHING YOU DO TO THAT DOLL,

08:02.433 --> 08:04.533
YOUR GHOST WILL FEEL.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.100
OBSERVE.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.733
- OW!

08:10.333 --> 08:11.867
- NO. A HUSBAND...

08:11.900 --> 08:15.433
WHO NEVER PUTS
HIS PANTS AWAY!

08:15.467 --> 08:18.433
NOW TELL ME WHAT YOUR GHOST
LOOKS LIKE.

08:18.467 --> 08:19.633
AND BE SPECIFIC.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.667
- GOSH.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.100
I DON'T KNOW.

08:22.133 --> 08:25.167
HE'S GOT
A NORMALLY KIND OF FACE,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.867
WITH A REGULAR-ISH
SORT OF NOSE

08:27.900 --> 08:30.400
AND A MOUTH THAT'S SORT OF--

08:30.433 --> 08:33.100
WHAT'S THE WORD?

08:33.133 --> 08:34.733
MOUTH-LIKE.

08:37.367 --> 08:38.700
- WHOA.

08:38.733 --> 08:41.133
YOU'RE VERY TALENTED.

08:41.167 --> 08:45.133
- THEN WHY DO WE LIVE
IN A SWAMP?

08:45.167 --> 08:47.167
OW!

08:49.133 --> 08:50.133
- THIS SMELLS INTERESTING.

08:50.167 --> 08:51.600
WHAT IS IT?

08:51.633 --> 08:54.067
- PETRIFIED PIG POOP.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.333
- CAN YOU JUST TELL ME
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING

08:56.367 --> 08:57.700
THAT'LL MAKE GUMBO POP.

08:57.733 --> 09:00.867
I'VE GOT JUST THE THING.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.267
PEOPLE AROUND THESE PARTS

09:03.300 --> 09:06.367
LOVE A LITTLE HEAT
IN THEIR GUMBO.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.633
AND NOTHING'S HOTTER
THAN THIS LITTLE FELLA--

09:09.667 --> 09:11.800
THE DRAGON TOOTH PEPPER.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.333
AHH, COME ON!

09:19.367 --> 09:21.367
- I'LL TAKE IT.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.467
ALL DONE?
- AHH.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.733
SMELLS LIKE FIRST PLACE.

09:32.767 --> 09:34.167
- YEAH.
- AGAIN.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.767
WELL, I THINK
IT SMELLS LIKE FEET.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.500
DE-FEAT!

09:40.533 --> 09:41.533
BURN!

09:41.567 --> 09:43.567
OW! BURN.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.500
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

09:46.533 --> 09:48.767
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
MOTHER-DAUGHTER TIME.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.600
- I WAS OUT GETTING
A SPECIAL INGREDIENT.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.133
- I TOLD YOU
WE DIDN'T NEED ONE.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.633
THE RECIPE I FOUND
IS REALLY GOOD.

09:53.667 --> 09:57.267
LOVING YOUR JEANS, BY THE WAY.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.600
- MOM, WE NEED TO FOCUS.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.300
THERE'S A FABULET
ON THE LINE HERE.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.800
- TOO LATE.
IT'S DONE.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.667
ACTUALLY, I'M DONE.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.700
YOU...CAN CLEAN UP.

10:05.733 --> 10:07.267
HIGH FIVE.

10:07.300 --> 10:10.700
THERE, WE BONDED.

10:10.733 --> 10:13.367
- ALL RIGHT, TIME TO GIVE
OUR GUMBO A LITTLE BITE,

10:13.400 --> 10:16.367
COURTESY OF THE DRAGON TOOTH.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.133
HOW MUCH SHOULD I PUT IN?

10:18.167 --> 10:20.767
EH.
MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER.

10:20.800 --> 10:26.100
NOW WE'RE COOKING.

10:26.133 --> 10:29.733
OOH, BOY!

10:29.767 --> 10:32.467
OH, MAN,
THAT'S WAY TOO HOT.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.333
GOOD-BYE, FABULET.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.367
UNLESS...

10:42.767 --> 10:44.767
HELLO, FABULET.

10:51.367 --> 10:54.433
THAT WAS A SYRUP JOKE.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.733
CHECK OUT MY NEW TOY.

10:58.767 --> 11:00.800
- IT'S KIND OF UGLY.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.633
- IT'S YOU.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.700
MEET MY "LOU-DOO" DOLL.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.533
- MY LOUIE VOODOO DOLL.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.700
WHATEVER I DO TO IT
HAPPENS TO YOU.

11:09.733 --> 11:11.767
YEAH, RIGHT.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.600
- I HOPED YOU'D SAY THAT.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.367
- WHOA!

11:16.400 --> 11:18.300
THAT THING REALLY WORKS.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.533
- INDEED IT DOES.

11:19.567 --> 11:22.467
AND YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE
IN DEEP VOODOO.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.700
THAT WAS A "DOO-DOO" JOKE.

11:24.733 --> 11:27.533
- AAH!

11:31.200 --> 11:35.400
- HOW MUCH LONGER TILL
YOU DON'T FIND THIS FUNNY?

11:35.433 --> 11:37.600
- I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.100
UH-OH.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.200
HERE COMES THE BOOGER PATROL.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.733
- FINE, WE'LL TAKE
A LITTLE BREAK.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.367
WHAT SAY YOU SNAP YOURSELF

11:49.400 --> 11:51.533
IN A NICE BIG PITCHER
OF GHOST O.J.?

11:51.567 --> 11:53.333
NO WAY. YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO MAKE ME

11:53.367 --> 11:54.667
POUR IT ON MY HEAD.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.067
- BINGO.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.733
- WELL, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.067
DON'T THINK ABOUT ORANGE JUICE,

12:00.100 --> 12:01.767
DON'T THINK
ABOUT ORANGE JUICE...

12:03.200 --> 12:05.067
HA! GHOST MILK.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.233
JOKE'S ON YOU!

12:13.167 --> 12:14.633
- 2% MILK,

12:14.667 --> 12:16.533
100% PAYBACK.

12:21.167 --> 12:22.667
- THERE SHE IS.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.633
TWO GALLONS OF
SAVORY CAJUN PERFECTION.

12:25.667 --> 12:29.067
SON, WE'RE JUST HOURS AWAY
FROM VICTORY NUMBER THREE.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.500
- AND ME WINNING THE CASH
TO GET MY COMIC BOOK.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.467
IF THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY
LEFT OVER--

12:33.500 --> 12:35.700
BICYCLE INSURANCE.

12:35.733 --> 12:37.267
- HMM.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.067
AFTER ALL THEIR BRAGGING,

12:39.067 --> 12:41.067
MICHELLE AND TAYLOR ARE GONNA
HAVE TO EAT THEIR WORDS.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.067
AND EVEN WORSE,
THEIR GUMBO.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.600
both:

12:48.633 --> 12:51.267
MY HEAD IS ON FIRE!

12:55.567 --> 12:59.233
- SWEET LOUISIANA LAVA!
WHAT'D YOU PUT IN THERE?

12:59.267 --> 13:02.267
- I ADDED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF KICK I ALWAYS DO!

13:02.300 --> 13:06.733
I MUST'VE GOTTEN DISTRACTED
AND OVERDONE IT.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.067
- WOW.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.700
THEIR GUMBO SMELLS AS GOOD
AS WHAT WE USUALLY MAKE.

13:10.733 --> 13:13.067
BUT NOT QUITE.

13:13.067 --> 13:15.400
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO MAKE ANOTHER BATCH.

13:15.433 --> 13:19.600
WELL, I GUESS THIS MEANS
NO DAPPER DAN COMIC.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.400
THESE TEARS ARE
FROM THE ONION.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.633
POOR LITTLE GUY.

13:26.667 --> 13:30.067
I KNOW HE HAD HIS HEART SET ON
THAT THIRD BLUE RIBBON--

13:30.067 --> 13:32.567
I MEAN COMIC BOOK.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.733
AS A FATHER
AND A GENTLEMAN,

13:35.767 --> 13:37.767
I HAVE TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

13:44.267 --> 13:45.633
- NO, I MEAN IT.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.167
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA WIN.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.067
YOU GUYS NAILED YOUR GUMBO.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.467
- THE TRICK IS NOT TO PUT
ANY STRANGE,

13:52.500 --> 13:54.233
EXOTIC INGREDIENTS IN IT.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.067
SO I DID NOT DO THAT.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.067
- WELL, I GUESS
IT'S ANOTHER YEAR

14:00.067 --> 14:02.200
WITHOUT BICYCLE INSURANCE.

14:02.233 --> 14:06.233
I'M JUST THUMBING MY NOSE
AT JOHNNY LAW.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.267
CONGRATULATIONS, TAYLOR.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.500
YOU EARNED IT.

14:10.533 --> 14:13.133
CAN'T TAKE THE GUILT.

14:13.167 --> 14:16.133
UGH. WHY DO I HAVE TO BE
SUCH A CARING PERSON?

14:20.233 --> 14:22.433
THERE.
GOOD-BYE, FABULET.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.633
GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO WATCH SHOWS ON A TV

14:24.667 --> 14:25.967
AND TALK TO MY FRIENDS
ON A PHONE

14:26.067 --> 14:28.233
LIKE SOME KIND OF FREAK.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.467
- OH, GOOD.
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.367
MY SNEAKER'S UNTIED.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.300
- THEN YOU BETTER WATCH
YOUR STEP.

14:38.333 --> 14:41.433
- BIG WORDS
FOR A SMALL MAN

14:41.467 --> 14:43.533
CONTROLLED BY
AN EVEN SMALLER DOLL.

14:43.567 --> 14:48.067
YOU CAN TIE MY SHOE
OR SMELL YOUR OWN ARMPIT.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.233
OR YOU CAN SAY HELLO

14:50.267 --> 14:52.967
TO MY LITTLE FRIEND.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.700
- MADAMELEBUEF.COM.

14:56.733 --> 14:58.300
FREE OVERNIGHT SHIPPING.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.600
AND STARTING NEXT MONTH,

14:59.633 --> 15:02.133
PILATES ON THE PORCH.

15:02.167 --> 15:06.133
- LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES
AN OLD FASHIONED VOO-DUEL.

15:07.533 --> 15:10.200
LET'S DANCE.

15:11.733 --> 15:14.433
THAT ALL YOU GOT?

15:14.467 --> 15:17.700
ROUND AND ROUND
THE FRANKIE GOES,

15:17.733 --> 15:19.067
WHERE SHE STOPS,

15:19.100 --> 15:20.233
ONLY LOUIE KNOWS!

15:33.500 --> 15:34.567
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.200
AW, MAN.

15:36.233 --> 15:38.067
STUCK IN A DOLL AGAIN?

15:38.100 --> 15:40.300
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

15:40.333 --> 15:43.133
THAT'S IT. FRANKIE.
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

15:44.167 --> 15:45.433
THIS IS FOR THE MILK!

15:45.467 --> 15:48.333
- GET YOUR TINY MITTS
OFF OF ME!

15:48.367 --> 15:50.200
- GROSS,
YOUR HAIR'S STICKY!

15:50.233 --> 15:53.267
- IT'S THE SYRUP,
FELT FACE!

15:55.500 --> 15:59.200
WHERE'S THE FRANKIE DOLL?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.200
LOUIE, SOMETHING'S
GOT MY DOLL,

16:04.233 --> 16:06.067
AND WHATEVER IT IS
HAS WHISKERS.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.533
IT'S A GIANT MUTANT RACCOON!

16:10.567 --> 16:12.233
OH, WAIT.

16:12.267 --> 16:15.267
IT'S A REGULAR-SIZED RACCOON.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.500
- LOUIE, HELP!

16:16.533 --> 16:18.333
JUMP IN THE VENT
AND GET MY DOLL BACK.

16:18.367 --> 16:20.433
SAVE ME.
- OH, MAN.

16:20.467 --> 16:21.733
I HATE RACCOONS.

16:21.767 --> 16:23.367
WHY COULDN'T
IT HAVE BEEN A PONY

16:23.400 --> 16:24.367
LIVING IN THE VENT?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.600
A SWEET LITTLE VENT PONY

16:26.633 --> 16:28.067
NAMED BUTTERSCOTCH,

16:28.067 --> 16:29.967
WHO GALLOPS ON A RAINBOW--

16:30.067 --> 16:31.733
- HURRY!
- OKAY.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.967
I'M COMING FOR YOU,
FRANKIE DOLL!

16:36.767 --> 16:38.400
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU SCARED HIM!

16:38.433 --> 16:42.400
- THAT WAS ME!
AAHH!

16:45.500 --> 16:48.433
- MIGHT AS WELL GET THIS
OVER WITH.

16:48.467 --> 16:51.067
- I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE JUDGE
TO TASTE OUR GUMBO.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.333
IT IS GOING
TO MELT IN HIS MOUTH.

16:53.367 --> 16:56.100
both: OR JUST MELT
HIS MOUTH.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.500
WHY'D YOU SAY THAT?

16:57.533 --> 16:59.067
NOTHING.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.067
- SHH.
HERE HE COMES.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.067
TRY TO LOOK SOUTHERN.

17:04.267 --> 17:07.433
- AND NEXT
WE HAVE THE LADY HATHAWAYS.

17:07.467 --> 17:08.733
WELCOME TO THE COMPETITION.

17:08.767 --> 17:12.433
OH, HOW DO.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.567
- I'D RECOGNIZE
THAT ACCENT FROM ANYWHERE.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.067
YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.467
COUPLE OF YANKEES THINK

17:17.500 --> 17:19.733
THEY CAN MAKE
SOME LOUISIANA GUMBO?

17:19.767 --> 17:22.367
WELL, WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT NOW, WON'T WE?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.667
OH, YES, WE WILL.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.167
OH, MY GOODNESS.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.233
THAT'S DOWNRIGHT SCRUMPTIOUS.

17:30.267 --> 17:33.367
IN FACT, THAT MIGHT BE THE ONE
TO BEAT, FOLKS.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.533
AND AS ALWAYS,

17:35.567 --> 17:37.433
WE GOT THE MYSTERIOUS CRAWDADDY,

17:37.467 --> 17:41.100
WHOSE ANONYMOUS ENTRY
NEVER FAILS TO DELIGHT.

17:42.733 --> 17:45.500
- IF THIS ISN'T THE SPICY GUMBO,
THEN WHERE'S THE--

17:46.700 --> 17:48.067
OH! OOF!

17:48.067 --> 17:49.700
FIERY MISSISSIPPI MUD PIE!

17:49.733 --> 17:52.133
THAT'S HOT! THAT'S HOT!

17:52.167 --> 17:54.467
AHH! AHH! AAH!

17:57.067 --> 17:59.533
- WE OVER-SPICED OUR GUMBO.

17:59.567 --> 18:02.133
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
I OVER-SPICED OUR GUMBO.

18:02.167 --> 18:04.233
AND I WANTED TO WIN SO BADLY
I SWITCHED IT WITH YOURS.

18:04.267 --> 18:05.633
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I FELT GUILTY.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.300
SO I SWITCHED
THE POTS BACK.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.200
- SO...

18:09.233 --> 18:10.400
FUNNY STORY.

18:10.433 --> 18:11.667
- WHOA! WHOA-OH!

18:15.067 --> 18:16.700
- AFTER I SMELLED
THE SPICY GUMBO,

18:16.733 --> 18:19.100
I MAY ALSO HAVE SWITCHED
THE POTS SO WE'D WIN.

18:19.133 --> 18:22.067
"
- I DID.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.533
- I AM SHOCKED
AT BOTH OF YOU!

18:24.567 --> 18:26.667
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO READ
AND INITIALLED

18:26.700 --> 18:28.700
THE COMPETITION ETHICS
GUIDELINES?

18:28.733 --> 18:29.967
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.067
- YOU'RE A WEIRD LITTLE BOY.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.333
WHOO!

18:35.367 --> 18:37.967
- DAD, I GUESS WE DESERVE THIS.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.300
- NOW THAT'S SOME GENUINE
CAJUN KICK-BUTT RIGHT THERE!

18:40.333 --> 18:41.467
I LOVE IT!

18:41.500 --> 18:42.700

18:42.733 --> 18:44.967

18:47.333 --> 18:48.533
AH!

18:48.567 --> 18:51.067
- YEAH, BABY!
THREE IN A ROW!

18:51.067 --> 18:53.233
- DAPPER DAN, HERE I COME.
- WAIT!

18:53.267 --> 18:54.467
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.600
SINCE ACTUALLY
THIS IS MY GUMBO...

18:56.633 --> 18:58.600
I KIND OF WON TOO.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.167
- GREAT, SO EVERYBODY GETS
SOMETHING BUT ME?

19:01.200 --> 19:04.600
- TAYLOR, YOU GOT
THE BEST THING OF ALL--

19:04.633 --> 19:06.067
A VALUABLE LESSON.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.067
- I DO NOT.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.567
- DON'T WORRY.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.600
I'VE GOT HIM RIGHT WHERE I--
AAAHH!

19:27.367 --> 19:29.700
- ALMOST GOT THE DOLL.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.233
HEY, THAT'S JV, DUDE.

19:31.267 --> 19:33.467
NOTHING BELOW THE BELT.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.067
OH, NO,
YOU DON'T!

19:36.067 --> 19:37.500
- HELP!

19:43.600 --> 19:45.133
- UH-OH.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.467
YOU OKAY?

20:00.367 --> 20:03.100
LOUIE?

20:06.100 --> 20:11.033
- DID SOMEBODY CALL
FOR A HERO?

20:11.067 --> 20:14.167
- YOU SAVED ME!

20:14.200 --> 20:16.633
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:16.667 --> 20:18.000
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I EVER HUGGED YOU.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.367
- RELAX.
I ALREADY JUMPED OUT.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.067
- I KNEW THAT.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.967
- SORRY I ALMOST FED YOU
TO A RACCOON.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.733
- SORRY I GAVE YOU
A MILK BATH.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.033
MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP MESSING
WITH EACH OTHER.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.100
I WAS SO BENT ON REVENGE,

20:33.133 --> 20:35.567
I STUDIED FOR WEEKS
TO MASTER THE SYRUP TRICK.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.267
YOU MAKE ME
A BETTER GHOST, FRANKIE.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.100
- I DO FORCE YOU
TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.133
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JUST
GET RID OF THESE DOLLS?

20:45.167 --> 20:46.967
- ABSOLUTELY.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.100
THESE THINGS ARE BAD NEWS.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.367
BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE
VOODOO DOLLS

20:50.400 --> 20:51.433
OF TAYLOR AND MILES, RIGHT?

20:51.467 --> 20:53.467
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.900
FOR SWITCHING THE GUMBO POTS.

21:00.933 --> 21:03.933
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME,
BUDDY.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.833
I TAKE THAT AS A NO.

21:09.867 --> 21:13.067
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY I JUST DID THAT.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.067
OR WHY I'M DOING THIS.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.967
- MILES,
YOU LOOK RIDICUL--

21:20.267 --> 21:21.567
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

21:21.600 --> 21:24.567
- LOUIE,
WHAT ARE WE THINKING?

21:24.600 --> 21:27.067
WE SHOULD BE RECORDING THIS.

21:27.100 --> 21:30.067
*

21:36.800 --> 21:44.800
*
