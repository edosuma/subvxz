00:39.427 --> 00:42.863
Bravo! Bravo!

00:47.534 --> 00:48.499
Coming through.

00:48.501 --> 00:50.303
Uh, I have
the carriage ready, sir.

00:54.708 --> 00:55.742
Hi.

01:21.434 --> 01:22.734
Where's
my sister?

01:22.736 --> 01:24.469
Shamrayev
went to the theater.

01:24.471 --> 01:25.737
She'll be here
any minute.

01:25.739 --> 01:28.373
I'm gonna miss
this old world.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.008
I wish...

01:30.010 --> 01:31.609
I wish I had seen more of it.

01:31.611 --> 01:33.611
No, don't talk nonsense.

01:33.613 --> 01:34.979
Well, you've seen more of it
than I have.

01:34.981 --> 01:37.149
Oh, I think they're here.

01:37.151 --> 01:38.685
Masha, come with me.

01:43.056 --> 01:45.325
- Ma'am.
- Oh, Polina.

01:46.659 --> 01:47.960
- Sir.
- Good evening.

01:47.962 --> 01:48.928
Masha.

01:50.697 --> 01:53.465
- Kostya.
- Hello, Mother.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.933
Look at you.

01:55.935 --> 01:59.404
- How is he?
- How am I?

01:59.406 --> 02:02.340
They found it necessary
to write for you to come,

02:02.342 --> 02:04.177
so I must be seriously ill.

02:11.151 --> 02:12.649
Konstantin?

02:12.651 --> 02:14.652
Your mother tells me you're
not angry with me anymore.

02:14.654 --> 02:17.523
Boris brought the magazine
with your new story in it.

02:17.525 --> 02:18.758
Show him.

02:20.193 --> 02:22.927
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

02:22.929 --> 02:25.729
While Sorin is resting,
why don't we play a game?

02:25.731 --> 02:28.566
- Should I get the lotto set, Mama?
- Yes, dear.

02:28.568 --> 02:31.938
You have many fans in Moscow.
Everyone's always asking about you.

02:36.342 --> 02:37.844
And did you like the story?

02:40.013 --> 02:42.416
I'm planning on reading it
on the train back to Moscow.

02:43.582 --> 02:44.984
So you'll be leaving soon?

02:46.252 --> 02:47.687
Tomorrow, probably.

02:51.357 --> 02:53.757
Polina, how can I help?

02:53.759 --> 02:54.759
I think we're ready.

02:54.761 --> 02:55.795
Yes.

02:56.829 --> 02:59.197
Boris, come.

02:59.199 --> 03:01.732
We never played when you
were here in the summer.

03:01.734 --> 03:04.769
We usually play lotto
when the long nights set in.

03:04.771 --> 03:06.704
This is my mother's old set.

03:06.706 --> 03:11.175
It's a stupid game, but after
a while, you don't notice.

03:11.177 --> 03:15.780
Kostya. Shut the window.
It's drafty.

03:15.782 --> 03:18.049
You should have heard the
reception they gave me tonight.

03:18.051 --> 03:19.650
Oh!

03:19.652 --> 03:21.986
My God. My head's still
spinning from it.

03:21.988 --> 03:24.222
Are you in, Konstantin?

03:24.224 --> 03:25.992
No, Mama. If you don't
mind, I'm gonna work for a bit.

03:28.727 --> 03:31.596
The stake is ten kopecks. You'll
put in for me, won't you, Doctor?

03:31.598 --> 03:33.264
Certainly.

03:33.266 --> 03:35.632
- Have we all put in?
- I'm in.

03:35.634 --> 03:37.036
You ready? Here we go.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.273
Twenty-two.

03:42.275 --> 03:45.076
Konstantin's playing.

03:45.078 --> 03:47.046
He must be unhappy,
poor lad.

03:49.648 --> 03:51.415
Seventy-seven.

03:51.417 --> 03:53.384
They've been having
a go at him in the newspapers.

03:53.386 --> 03:55.953
He can't seem to
find his own voice.

03:55.955 --> 03:57.655
Well,
I believe in Konstantin.

03:57.657 --> 04:00.191
There's something there.
He thinks in images.

04:00.193 --> 04:03.794
His stories are striking. I'm
affected by them. Aren't you?

04:03.796 --> 04:04.797
Eight.

04:05.931 --> 04:07.798
Eighty-one.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.834
Oh, Papa.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.659
One more time,
from the beginning.

04:34.661 --> 04:37.662
No, if I don't get home now, my
father won't let me come back later.

04:37.664 --> 04:38.963
Ride with me.

04:38.965 --> 04:40.567
I can't. There's
too much work to do.

04:54.681 --> 04:56.681
I'll see you tonight.

04:56.683 --> 04:59.152
Don't be late,
and study your lines.

05:00.752 --> 05:01.787
Hey.

05:13.266 --> 05:14.534
I love you.

05:59.978 --> 06:01.212
Kostya!

06:01.214 --> 06:02.649
I'm putting
the puppets over here.

07:11.617 --> 07:12.882
Want one?

07:12.884 --> 07:15.220
Uh, no.
Thank you.

07:18.624 --> 07:20.590
Why do you always
wear black?

07:20.592 --> 07:23.829
I'm in mourning
for my life.

07:25.030 --> 07:26.963
Why?

07:26.965 --> 07:32.068
You're healthy. You have
enough money to get by.

07:32.070 --> 07:34.839
Life's a lot harder for me.
I'm a schoolteacher.

07:34.841 --> 07:36.841
I hardly make anything.

07:36.843 --> 07:38.711
You don't see me
all in black.

07:39.679 --> 07:40.876
It's not about money.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.048
Even a poor man can be happy.

07:46.184 --> 07:49.953
Every day, I meet with nothing
but indifference from you.

07:49.955 --> 07:51.223
Stop it, Medvedenko.

07:52.759 --> 07:54.858
I'm touched by your love.

07:54.860 --> 07:56.395
I just can't return it.
That's all.

08:01.099 --> 08:02.532
- Now, this is a theater.
- Masha.

08:02.534 --> 08:04.335
Masha, wait!

08:04.337 --> 08:06.871
The curtain will go up at 8:30
sharp, when the moon is rising.

08:06.873 --> 08:08.905
- Exciting.
- Of course,

08:08.907 --> 08:10.841
if Nina doesn't get here soon,
the whole effect will be ruined.

08:10.843 --> 08:12.542
God, she's already late.

08:12.544 --> 08:14.077
Don't be impatient.

08:14.079 --> 08:16.446
You know what
her father is like?

08:16.448 --> 08:19.249
I have one thing to ask you.
I have one word to say to you.

08:19.251 --> 08:22.085
Champagne. Did I not
ask for champagne

08:22.087 --> 08:23.953
- this morning in my...
- Sweetheart, sweetheart.

08:23.955 --> 08:25.488
- Did I not ask for it last night?
- Sweetheart, we're out.

08:25.490 --> 08:27.257
No, I wanted it
upstairs in my bedroom.

08:27.259 --> 08:29.795
Why is my sister
in such a bad mood?

08:30.763 --> 08:31.831
Why?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.099
She's bored.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.900
Jealous.

08:36.903 --> 08:38.967
She's already set
against me and the play

08:38.970 --> 08:42.938
because she's not
acting in it, and Nina is.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.574
She already hates it.

08:44.576 --> 08:45.941
Your mother adores you.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.944
She also knows I have
no respect for her theater.

08:47.946 --> 08:50.180
She thinks she's dedicated
to serving humanity

08:50.182 --> 08:53.750
with her sacred art,
but as far as I'm concerned,

08:53.752 --> 08:58.087
the modern theater is trite
and riddled with cliches.

08:58.089 --> 09:00.490
When they take cheap,
vulgar plots

09:00.492 --> 09:03.091
and cheap, vulgar speeches
and try to extract

09:03.093 --> 09:05.195
- some easily digestible moral,
- Oh, God.

09:05.197 --> 09:07.330
I want to run out of the exit
and keep on running

09:07.332 --> 09:09.232
the way Maupassant ran
from the Eiffel Tower

09:09.234 --> 09:11.134
because its vulgarity
was crushing his brain.

09:11.136 --> 09:14.571
- We need the theater.
- What we need are new forms,

09:14.573 --> 09:16.739
and if we can't have them,
then give us nothing!

09:18.977 --> 09:19.978
Boris!

09:23.181 --> 09:24.981
Come. Come here.

09:27.486 --> 09:28.585
Hey!

09:28.587 --> 09:30.188
What's the gossip on him?

09:31.623 --> 09:33.491
He's smart, actually.

09:33.493 --> 09:35.558
Unpretentious.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.095
Kind of melancholy.
Pretty decent, really.

09:39.097 --> 09:40.996
Not even 40,
but he's already a celebrity.

09:42.334 --> 09:45.468
Maybe a little
full of himself.

09:45.470 --> 09:48.003
These days, he drinks a lot of beer
and makes love to older women.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.139
Well, when I was young,

09:50.141 --> 09:54.110
I passionately wanted
two things.

09:54.112 --> 09:58.015
I wanted to get married.
I wanted to become an author.

10:01.385 --> 10:03.152
I never managed either one.

10:03.154 --> 10:05.522
Nina, hello!

10:05.524 --> 10:08.090
Even the thought of her
makes my heart race.

10:08.092 --> 10:09.728
I am insanely happy.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.575
My muse, my dream.

10:29.179 --> 10:32.314
- Please tell me I'm not late.
- No.

10:32.316 --> 10:35.687
I've been worrying all day. I
rode like a madman to get here.

10:39.390 --> 10:42.491
It's all right. We're alone.

10:42.493 --> 10:43.862
Is that you, Yakov?

10:44.897 --> 10:47.062
Yeah.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.498
We'll start when the sun sets. Get
everyone ready in their places.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.533
- Is the moon rising?
- Yep.

10:50.535 --> 10:52.835
Arise, fair sun,

10:52.837 --> 10:56.073
and kill the envious moon, who is
already sick and pale with grief.

10:58.209 --> 10:59.842
Why are you so nervous?

10:59.844 --> 11:01.511
I'm not.

11:01.513 --> 11:04.547
Well, I'm not afraid to
perform for your mother,

11:04.549 --> 11:07.584
but Boris Trigorin,
he's so famous.

11:07.586 --> 11:09.921
I'm embarrassed
to act in front of him.

11:12.925 --> 11:14.222
He looked young.

11:14.224 --> 11:17.194
He is young and accomplished,
don't remind me.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.865
His stories are incredible.

11:26.304 --> 11:28.871
Well, his stories
are full of life.

11:28.873 --> 11:30.873
In your plays,
everyone's dead.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.709
My goal is to show life the way
we experience it in dreams,

11:33.711 --> 11:35.979
not the way it is or the way
we think it should be.

11:35.981 --> 11:38.347
Yes, but nothing happens
in your play.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.884
It's all talk.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.321
I think there should be
a love story.

11:50.562 --> 11:52.929
"A country place,"
they called it.

11:52.931 --> 11:55.297
And I was standing
in the back...

11:55.299 --> 11:58.300
It's getting damp.

11:58.302 --> 12:01.269
Go back before the play starts.
Put on your boots.

12:01.271 --> 12:03.306
I'm too hot.

12:03.308 --> 12:07.176
You're too stubborn.
Your feet will get wet.

12:07.178 --> 12:09.146
You're a doctor.
You should know better.

12:12.917 --> 12:16.351
Oh, look at that. We're
gonna be sitting in the woods.

12:16.353 --> 12:18.988
You like her. Admit it.

12:18.990 --> 12:20.323
Who do you like?

12:48.253 --> 12:50.987
Masha, please ask your
father to unchain his dog.

12:50.989 --> 12:52.821
Otherwise,
he'll be howling all night.

12:52.823 --> 12:54.191
Ask him yourself.

12:58.163 --> 13:00.328
Shall I sit
next to you, Doctor?

13:00.330 --> 13:04.033
Darling son,
when do we begin?

13:04.035 --> 13:06.368
In a minute.
Please be patient.

13:06.370 --> 13:11.373
Gentle son, upon the heat and flame of
thy distemper, sprinkle cool patience.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.008
Mmm.

13:13.010 --> 13:15.343
O gentle Mother,
let me wring your heart

13:15.345 --> 13:17.646
if it be made of penetrable stuff.

13:17.648 --> 13:20.382
Look here upon this picture.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.852
You cannot call it "love,"
for at your age,

13:22.854 --> 13:25.555
the heyday in the blood
is tame.

13:25.557 --> 13:26.924
It's humble.

13:28.292 --> 13:31.259
O you honorable
ancient shadows,

13:31.261 --> 13:33.429
which drift among us

13:33.431 --> 13:36.365
as night descends
upon this lake,

13:36.367 --> 13:39.535
lull us to sleep,
and let us dream

13:39.537 --> 13:43.238
of that which will come to be
in 200,000 years.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.408
In 200,000
years, there'll be nothing.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.077
Then let them show us nothing.

13:48.079 --> 13:50.346
Yes, let them. We're
already asleep.

13:51.682 --> 13:52.982
Oh.

14:01.058 --> 14:02.160
Humans,

14:03.728 --> 14:08.298
lions, eagles and partridges,

14:09.100 --> 14:11.134
horned deer,

14:11.136 --> 14:12.170
geese,

14:14.705 --> 14:19.041
silent fishes
dwelling in the water,

14:19.043 --> 14:23.246
starfish, and
those that cannot be seen

14:23.248 --> 14:25.115
- with our eyes.
- Oh, thank you.

14:26.383 --> 14:31.454
In a word, all lives,
all lives,

14:31.456 --> 14:34.056
all lives,

14:34.058 --> 14:37.294
having accomplished
their doleful circle,

14:38.862 --> 14:40.863
have died out.

14:40.865 --> 14:44.299
Already, thousands
of centuries have passed

14:44.301 --> 14:47.636
since the Earth has borne
one living creature,

14:47.638 --> 14:52.908
and, in vain, the poor
moon shines her light.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.413
Cold, cold,

14:58.415 --> 15:01.152
empty, empty,

15:02.287 --> 15:05.121
horrible, horrible,

15:05.123 --> 15:07.122
most horrible...

15:07.124 --> 15:08.557
My thoughts exactly.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.958
Mother!

15:09.960 --> 15:11.459
Sorry.

15:11.461 --> 15:14.429
Keep going.
Go on. Go on.

15:14.431 --> 15:19.669
The bodies of living creatures
have vanished into dust,

15:19.671 --> 15:24.840
and their souls
have fused into one.

15:24.842 --> 15:27.709
The universal soul.

15:27.711 --> 15:31.346
- Sir.
- It is I. I!

15:31.348 --> 15:36.319
In my soul is
Alexander the Great,

15:36.321 --> 15:39.989
and Caesar, and Shakespeare,

15:39.991 --> 15:41.923
and Napoleon,

15:41.925 --> 15:44.326
and the lowliest of leeches.

15:44.328 --> 15:47.262
I think this is supposed
to be high art.

15:47.264 --> 15:48.398
Mother!

15:51.401 --> 15:53.336
I am alone.

15:53.338 --> 15:55.704
I am alone.

15:55.706 --> 16:00.475
Once in 100 years, I open
my lips in order to speak,

16:00.477 --> 16:05.780
and my voice is heard
in this cheerless emptiness.

16:05.782 --> 16:09.651
And no one listens.
And the devil,

16:09.653 --> 16:12.153
the father of eternal matter,

16:12.155 --> 16:14.990
determined to keep life
from springing up in you,

16:14.992 --> 16:18.159
causes a constant
transmutation of atoms.

16:18.161 --> 16:21.796
Like a captive
cast into a deep, hollow void,

16:21.798 --> 16:24.166
I do not know
what waits for me.

16:24.168 --> 16:28.204
In this stubborn,
cruel struggle with the devil,

16:28.206 --> 16:30.405
I can see clearly

16:30.407 --> 16:33.074
- that I am destined to vanquish him.
- Uh, it smells like something's burning.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.044
- Mother!
- Yes, I smell smoke.

16:35.046 --> 16:36.613
And until that time...

16:37.514 --> 16:41.083
Horror! Horror!

16:41.085 --> 16:43.418
Horror!

16:43.420 --> 16:45.954
My powerful adversary,

16:45.956 --> 16:48.590
- the devil, comes closer.
- Oh. Oh, I see.

16:48.592 --> 16:53.028
- Oh. It's a special effect.
- I see his terrible crimson eyes.

16:53.030 --> 16:54.397
- He is bored without man.
- Put your hat back on.

16:54.399 --> 16:56.463
- You'll catch a cold.
- No, the Doctor

16:56.465 --> 16:59.401
has tipped his hat to the devil,
the father of eternal matter.

16:59.403 --> 17:01.770
All right, that's it! The play
is finished! Enough, enough.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.470
Curtain! Curtain!

17:03.472 --> 17:05.740
Bring up the curtain!
Bring down the curtain!

17:05.742 --> 17:07.375
I've had enough!

17:07.377 --> 17:09.476
- Enough! No, enough!
- Why are you angry?

17:09.478 --> 17:11.579
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I forgot
that writing and acting in plays

17:11.580 --> 17:14.082
is reserved for
the chosen few!

17:14.084 --> 17:16.450
I've defied the monopoly!

17:16.452 --> 17:19.655
- Hey, Kostya.
- What is wrong with him?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.492
What did I do?

17:30.834 --> 17:33.202
For heaven's sake,
he wanted to please you.

17:33.204 --> 17:37.872
And I was willing to listen,
even to his ravings, but...

17:37.874 --> 17:40.507
His claims to new forms,
they're pretentious.

17:40.509 --> 17:44.145
Since when has the exhibition
of a morbid personality

17:44.147 --> 17:46.014
been a new art form?

17:46.016 --> 17:48.883
Everyone writes what he wants
and as best he can.

17:48.885 --> 17:53.121
Well, then let him write what
he wants and as best he can.

17:53.123 --> 17:55.657
Just tell him
to please leave me in peace.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.859
When Jupiter's angry,
Jupiter's wrong.

17:58.962 --> 18:00.861
I am not Jupiter.

18:00.863 --> 18:04.132
I am a woman,
and I am not angry.

18:04.134 --> 18:09.671
I'm disappointed that a young man
should spend his time so foolishly.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.674
Thank you.

18:12.476 --> 18:14.976
You know, someone should
write a play

18:14.978 --> 18:17.380
about a schoolteacher
and how he lives.

18:17.382 --> 18:18.982
- It's a hard life.
- Hmm.

18:22.152 --> 18:23.488
It's very, very hard.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.544
Boris, come.
Come sit by me now.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.315
Oh...

18:55.551 --> 18:59.586
You should have been here ten,
even five years ago.

18:59.588 --> 19:06.294
We listened to music and singing all
night long, almost every night.

19:06.296 --> 19:08.329
Remember all the laughter
and the noise?

19:09.565 --> 19:14.202
And the love affairs...
So many love affairs.

19:14.204 --> 19:17.571
Guess who was the romantic
idol of the town.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.574
None other than the Doctor.

19:20.576 --> 19:24.145
You're handsome now, but
then you were irresistible.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.865
Why did I hurt him?

19:49.473 --> 19:51.006
Konstantin!

19:51.975 --> 19:55.008
Konstantin!

19:55.010 --> 19:58.482
- I'll go and look for him.
- Would you? Thanks.

19:59.549 --> 20:01.917
Konstantin!

20:03.487 --> 20:06.823
Konstantin!

20:13.029 --> 20:15.263
Polina.

20:15.265 --> 20:16.800
- Mama?
- Polina.

20:17.667 --> 20:18.801
Papa.

20:22.272 --> 20:23.805
Excuse me.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.109
It's nothing.

20:28.578 --> 20:30.747
Don't worry.
I just felt a little sad.

20:41.957 --> 20:43.092
Excuse me.

20:46.429 --> 20:48.695
Konstantin!

21:26.535 --> 21:28.001
Oh, come in.

21:28.003 --> 21:29.870
Come in.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.876
Oh...

21:35.044 --> 21:37.044
Is our playwright
still in hiding?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.979
- Well, I can't find him.
- Oh.

21:38.981 --> 21:41.482
- Brava.
- Ah, yes. Brava.

21:41.484 --> 21:43.650
- Brava.
- Brava.

21:43.652 --> 21:47.689
Well, we all adored you.
You were wonderful.

21:47.691 --> 21:49.856
Such a face,
such a marvelous voice.

21:49.858 --> 21:52.594
It would be a shame for you
to stay in the country.

21:52.596 --> 21:54.761
You must go on the stage.

21:54.763 --> 21:57.731
Well, that's my dream, but...

21:57.733 --> 21:59.603
But what? It could happen.

22:02.871 --> 22:05.339
Oh, allow me to introduce you.

22:05.341 --> 22:07.075
Boris Trigorin.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.875
No, no. Don't be shy.

22:08.877 --> 22:11.078
He's a celebrity,
but he has a simple soul.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.846
Irina.

22:12.848 --> 22:14.381
A pleasure.

22:14.383 --> 22:17.785
I'm honored.
I've read all your work.

22:19.888 --> 22:21.788
You see? He's shy, too.

22:26.363 --> 22:28.130
Konstantin!

22:30.199 --> 22:31.967
Konstantin!

22:32.768 --> 22:34.034
Irina?

22:34.036 --> 22:35.569
Oh.

22:35.571 --> 22:36.573
Thank you.

22:39.743 --> 22:40.941
Oh.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.444
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:47.916 --> 22:51.018
It was a strange play,
wasn't it?

22:51.020 --> 22:53.655
I didn't understand a word of it.

22:53.657 --> 22:55.256
But I enjoyed watching it.

22:55.258 --> 22:57.460
Uh, you were...
You were so sincere.

22:58.826 --> 23:01.897
And the scenery was
so beautiful.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.969
Are there fish in the lake?

23:08.137 --> 23:09.204
Yes.

23:10.406 --> 23:11.474
I love fishing.

23:13.442 --> 23:15.243
I can think of nothing more
enjoyable

23:15.245 --> 23:18.581
than an evening on the bank
with a fishing pole in my hand.

23:20.883 --> 23:21.948
Ah.

23:21.950 --> 23:23.218
There you are.

23:25.422 --> 23:27.821
I hope you're not
flattering him.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.891
He doesn't know how to behave when
people say nice things to him.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.362
Excuse me.

23:35.632 --> 23:37.765
<i>And there was another time...</i>

23:37.767 --> 23:39.832
<i>This was in Moscow
at the opera.</i>

23:39.834 --> 23:44.871
The celebrated Silva
sang a low C.

23:44.873 --> 23:46.773
And, um...

23:46.775 --> 23:48.475
But as luck would have it,

23:48.477 --> 23:52.145
a bass from our church choir
was sitting in the gallery,

23:52.147 --> 23:54.448
and all of a sudden,
to our complete amazement,

23:54.450 --> 23:56.883
we hear from the gallery,

23:56.885 --> 24:01.188
"Bravo, Silva."

24:01.190 --> 24:03.023
A full octave lower!

24:03.025 --> 24:05.092
Like this,

24:05.094 --> 24:08.832
"Bravo, Silva."

24:15.971 --> 24:18.640
The angel of silence
has just flown over.

24:20.844 --> 24:22.943
Well, it's time for me to go.

24:22.945 --> 24:25.010
Oh.

24:25.012 --> 24:27.347
It's so early.
We won't let you.

24:27.349 --> 24:30.518
Oh, no, my father
is waiting for me.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.352
Oh, well, it's a shame.
It's just a shame.

24:32.354 --> 24:35.020
- Just for an hour. Really, stay.
- Oh, no.

24:35.022 --> 24:36.390
I'd really love to,
but I can't.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.360
I'm sorry. Good night.

24:41.864 --> 24:43.530
Poor girl.

24:43.532 --> 24:45.097
Literally.

24:45.099 --> 24:46.967
Her mother died and left
everything to her father,

24:46.969 --> 24:50.303
but when he dies, he's leaving
everything to his new wife.

24:50.305 --> 24:53.740
Nina won't get a cent.
She'll have nothing.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.409
It's scandalous.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.676
Yes.

24:56.678 --> 24:59.715
To be frank,
her father is a monster.

25:04.253 --> 25:09.423
Well, I'd better move before
I freeze in this position.

25:09.425 --> 25:12.526
Your legs are like stiff boards.

25:12.528 --> 25:15.262
Let's get you some fresh air,
you unlucky old man.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.197
Madame?

25:17.199 --> 25:19.800
Be a good man.
Unleash that dog.

25:19.802 --> 25:21.935
Can't do that.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.373
I'm worried thieves
will get into the barn.

25:26.508 --> 25:30.109
I'm telling you,
it was a whole octave lower,

25:30.111 --> 25:31.378
like this,

25:31.380 --> 25:33.145
"Bravo, Silva."

25:33.147 --> 25:36.783
And he wasn't a famous singer,
just a church choir member.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.721
How much does a singer
in a church choir make?

25:49.231 --> 25:52.966
Maybe I've lost my
mind, but I liked the play.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.901
No one's here, are they?

25:54.903 --> 25:55.838
I'm here.

25:56.773 --> 25:58.172
Move over.

26:02.144 --> 26:05.112
There was something about it.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.782
A feeling of loneliness.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.918
And then, when the eyes
of the devil appeared,

26:11.920 --> 26:14.286
my hands were shaking.

26:14.288 --> 26:16.590
Konstantin!

26:16.592 --> 26:17.958
Konstantin!

26:17.960 --> 26:19.826
Masha's looking for me
everywhere.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.360
Konstantin,

26:21.362 --> 26:23.730
I liked your play very much.

26:23.732 --> 26:26.166
It's definitely strange.

26:26.168 --> 26:28.735
And I didn't hear the end,
of course,

26:28.737 --> 26:32.472
but it made a strong
impression on me.

26:32.474 --> 26:35.577
You're a talented man.
You need to continue.

26:42.618 --> 26:45.986
You know, I've had a pretty
interesting life.

26:45.988 --> 26:48.187
I'm content, but...

26:48.189 --> 26:51.690
If I ever got to experience
the spiritual high

26:51.692 --> 26:53.994
an artist feels
at the moment of creation,

26:53.996 --> 26:58.164
I bet I would abandon my current
life, leave it all behind.

26:58.166 --> 27:00.267
Chase new highs,

27:00.269 --> 27:04.273
never let myself get weighed
down in this earthly existence.

27:07.041 --> 27:08.110
Where is Nina?

27:10.879 --> 27:11.915
She went home.

27:12.848 --> 27:13.980
I should go to her.

27:13.982 --> 27:16.048
Konstantin!

27:16.050 --> 27:18.083
Hey, Kostya.

27:18.085 --> 27:19.886
Kostya, stay here.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.388
- Konstantin.
- No, I've got to get out of here.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.055
Will you please
go back to the house?

27:23.057 --> 27:24.891
- Your mother is very worried.
- Tell her I left.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.292
- Wait, Konstantin.
- What do you want?

27:26.294 --> 27:28.060
- I know you're upset, and I'm sorry.
- No.

27:28.062 --> 27:29.628
- Masha, please. Listen to me.
- I'm trying to help.

27:29.630 --> 27:32.132
No, I'm saying that I
understand. What can I do?

27:32.134 --> 27:33.232
You can leave me alone.

27:33.234 --> 27:35.067
Come on.
Don't be like that.

27:35.069 --> 27:36.702
I'm sorry, Doctor.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.709
Youth. Youth.

27:43.411 --> 27:47.580
When people have nothing better
to say, they say, "Youth. Youth."

27:57.059 --> 27:58.292
It's a filthy habit.

28:04.967 --> 28:06.766
Masha.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.504
What's wrong? What's wrong, Masha?

28:11.873 --> 28:14.308
Nobody knows how much
I'm suffering.

28:18.412 --> 28:20.981
I love Konstantin.

28:20.983 --> 28:22.183
Oh, God.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.253
Oh.

28:27.521 --> 28:29.725
The spells cast by this lake.

28:30.692 --> 28:32.291
Aw.

28:32.293 --> 28:34.128
Well, what can I do, my child?

28:34.762 --> 28:35.764
Hmm?

28:36.498 --> 28:37.599
What?

29:11.165 --> 29:12.366
Konstantin.

29:13.769 --> 29:15.169
Konstantin.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.544
Masha.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.181
Why is my son so depressed?

29:28.984 --> 29:30.317
He's heartsick.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.262
My foot's asleep.

29:56.811 --> 29:58.343
Masha?

29:58.345 --> 30:02.214
<i>Always in black,
smokes, drinks vodka.</i>

30:02.216 --> 30:03.818
<i>The schoolteacher loves her.</i>

30:42.890 --> 30:44.959
All right.
Come stand next to me.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.393
You're 28, yes?

30:48.395 --> 30:49.864
I'm almost twice your age.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.364
Come.

30:52.366 --> 30:54.102
Sergei, which of us
looks younger?

30:57.873 --> 30:59.037
Well?

30:59.039 --> 31:00.474
Which of us looks younger?

31:03.110 --> 31:04.911
You do, of course.

31:04.913 --> 31:06.044
Ah.

31:06.046 --> 31:08.447
There, you see? And why?

31:08.449 --> 31:11.086
Because I work. I'm
constantly doing something.

31:11.952 --> 31:13.752
I experience life.

31:13.754 --> 31:16.991
You just sit still in one
place, not really living.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.691
Yes?

31:18.693 --> 31:22.360
And I have a rule.

31:22.362 --> 31:27.499
I never think about the future. I
never think about old age or death.

31:27.501 --> 31:30.736
What will come in life
will come.

31:30.738 --> 31:34.873
I always hold myself straight
and tall, and I'm dressed

31:34.875 --> 31:37.643
with my hair <i>comme il faut.</i>

31:37.645 --> 31:41.247
Would I ever go outside,
even here to the garden,

31:41.249 --> 31:44.583
in my working clothes, without
my hair perfectly coiffed?

31:44.585 --> 31:45.619
Never.

31:47.087 --> 31:49.721
And I stay out of the sun,
naturally.

31:49.723 --> 31:51.592
That's why I look
so good at my age.

31:53.661 --> 31:56.129
I just never let myself go
like some people.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.328
See, Masha?

31:57.330 --> 32:00.199
Look at me. See?

32:00.201 --> 32:04.436
Light as a feather.
I could play a girl of 15.

32:20.387 --> 32:23.455
Guess whose father
and stepmother

32:23.457 --> 32:26.491
- have gone to Yalta for three days.
- Ah.

32:26.493 --> 32:28.459
I'm yours until
they've returned.

32:28.461 --> 32:31.397
Isn't she adorable?
Give us a turn.

32:32.366 --> 32:33.699
Ah!

32:33.701 --> 32:35.000
Simply adorable.

32:35.002 --> 32:38.704
Yes, and nicely dressed.

32:38.706 --> 32:41.242
You're a clever girl.
Well, sit down. Join us.

32:44.012 --> 32:45.978
I think we'll start with
the croquettes, Eugenie.

32:45.980 --> 32:47.146
Yes, ma'am.

32:47.148 --> 32:49.147
I ache all over.

32:49.149 --> 32:51.415
But the Doctor here
won't treat me.

32:51.417 --> 32:53.151
You're an old man.

32:53.153 --> 32:55.220
Even old men want to live.

32:56.824 --> 32:58.556
Where is Boris?

32:58.558 --> 33:00.461
He's down by the lake,
fishing.

33:02.363 --> 33:03.764
Have you spoken to Konstantin?

33:04.565 --> 33:05.998
Uh, no.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.766
- I don't think he wants to talk to me.
- Oh?

33:08.768 --> 33:11.570
You should recite more
from his play later.

33:11.572 --> 33:13.372
I'd love to hear the ending.

33:13.374 --> 33:14.573
Really?

33:14.575 --> 33:15.642
Why?

33:21.882 --> 33:28.420
I think it was 1873
at the Poltava Fair.

33:28.422 --> 33:31.456
She was amazing. Gave
an incredible performance.

33:31.458 --> 33:33.457
Quite wonderful.

33:33.459 --> 33:36.795
Do you happen to know what
became of the comedian, Chadin?

33:36.797 --> 33:39.864
He gave an incomparable
Rasplyuyev.

33:39.866 --> 33:42.601
Better than Sadovsky.
You have my word, ma'am.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.435
What is he doing now, ma'am?

33:44.437 --> 33:47.471
You keep asking me about
people from before the flood.

33:47.473 --> 33:48.974
How should I know?

33:48.976 --> 33:51.610
How about some music
after our meal?

33:51.612 --> 33:53.711
- You'll sing for us, darling, won't you?
- No, no.

33:53.713 --> 33:55.180
- Oh, yes.
- No, no. I couldn't.

33:55.182 --> 33:56.415
Yes, yes, just one song.

33:56.417 --> 33:57.548
Absolutely not.

33:57.550 --> 33:59.618
Singing is hardly my forte.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.452
Well, then perhaps Nina.

34:01.454 --> 34:03.888
Won't you sing for us?

34:03.890 --> 34:08.260
<i>♪ Eyes that haunt me so
Eyes that taunt me so</i>

34:08.262 --> 34:12.630
<i>♪ While they smiled at me
Life was ecstasy</i>

34:12.632 --> 34:15.634
<i>♪ I'm in love with you</i>

34:15.636 --> 34:17.501
<i>♪ I'm afraid of you</i>

34:17.503 --> 34:21.940
<i>♪ Since I saw you go
Now my spirit's low</i>

34:21.942 --> 34:26.610
<i>♪ Eyes of destiny
While you beckon me</i>

34:26.612 --> 34:31.014
<i>♪ I must follow still
Over plain and hill</i>

34:31.016 --> 34:33.618
<i>♪ Love, where'er I be</i>

34:33.620 --> 34:35.253
<i>♪ I shall always see</i>

34:35.255 --> 34:37.487
<i>♪ Stars of hope for me</i>

34:37.489 --> 34:40.659
<i>♪ Your dark eyes ♪</i>

34:46.065 --> 34:49.467
Ah, I haven't sung
like that in years.

34:49.469 --> 34:51.936
I sounded so good.

35:05.084 --> 35:08.020
It's hot. It's quiet.

35:08.022 --> 35:11.922
No one does anything.
Why does no one do anything?

35:11.924 --> 35:17.129
- Well, I'm trying to read.
- Yes, well, good for you.

35:17.131 --> 35:19.630
I'm considering
going into town.

35:19.632 --> 35:21.833
Polina. You'd join me,
wouldn't you?

35:21.835 --> 35:24.403
- I'd be happy to escort you.
- Ha!

35:24.405 --> 35:25.903
Then it's settled.

35:25.905 --> 35:28.407
You'll arrange the horses
to take us into town

35:28.409 --> 35:30.142
in about an hour.

35:30.144 --> 35:33.512
- I think it's a grand idea.
- Ma'am?

35:33.514 --> 35:36.680
It's a good plan,
but how will you get there?

35:36.682 --> 35:38.350
Excuse me?

35:38.352 --> 35:40.851
Well, forgive me, ma'am,
but we're carting rye today.

35:40.853 --> 35:43.054
Which horses were you
thinking of using?

35:43.056 --> 35:45.323
"Which horses"?
How should I know?

35:45.325 --> 35:46.791
Don't we have carriage horses?

35:46.793 --> 35:49.360
"Don't we have
carriage horses?"

35:49.362 --> 35:51.997
Sir, with the greatest respect,
you don't seem to understand

35:51.999 --> 35:54.232
- a thing about farming.
- No.

35:54.234 --> 35:56.600
You don't seem to understand
how to do your job.

35:56.602 --> 35:58.370
- I'm sure we can resolve this.
- No, no, no.

35:58.372 --> 36:00.571
He pulls this every year.

36:00.573 --> 36:02.741
Because every year, you lack any
sense of how this farm operates.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.409
- Don't lecture me.
- Please.

36:04.411 --> 36:06.211
I am going to Moscow,
and I'm going today.

36:06.213 --> 36:10.314
Would you please be so good as
to hire horses in the village?

36:10.316 --> 36:12.217
Well, I cannot conjure horses
out of thin air.

36:12.219 --> 36:13.818
Absolutely incompetent!

36:13.820 --> 36:15.820
Every year,
it's the same excuses.

36:17.390 --> 36:19.724
Well, if that's how you feel,
I resign!

36:19.726 --> 36:23.228
Every summer, I come down here,
and I am insulted by you.

36:23.230 --> 36:25.363
Then you can find yourself
another manager.

36:25.365 --> 36:27.765
Fine. I'm going into town,
and I'm not coming back.

36:27.767 --> 36:30.068
Farewell. My deepest apologies

36:30.070 --> 36:34.438
for being unable to magically
conjure horses out of thin air!

36:34.440 --> 36:36.241
How hard is it
to find a horse?

36:36.243 --> 36:38.609
My kingdom for a bloody horse!

36:38.611 --> 36:40.712
Apologize to her!

36:40.714 --> 36:42.416
Oh, God!

36:48.855 --> 36:50.922
What did I miss?

36:50.924 --> 36:55.159
Irina is upset, Polina is crying,
and Shamrayev is resigning.

36:56.597 --> 36:58.297
I'll offer to tranquilize
all of them.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.360
What's that supposed to mean?

38:03.362 --> 38:06.333
I sank low enough today
to kill this seagull.

38:07.333 --> 38:08.669
I lay it at your feet.

38:09.834 --> 38:11.503
What's wrong with you?

38:11.505 --> 38:13.705
Soon, I'm gonna kill myself
in the same way.

38:15.942 --> 38:17.808
Don't follow me.

38:17.810 --> 38:21.045
- I don't know you like this.
- I don't know you like this!

38:21.047 --> 38:23.483
You look at me
as if I'm a stranger...

38:24.550 --> 38:27.251
Are you embarrassed by me?

38:27.253 --> 38:31.889
Well, lately,
you've become so...

38:31.891 --> 38:34.892
You keep talking
in symbols or...

38:34.894 --> 38:38.729
I mean, look at that seagull.
What does that mean?

38:38.731 --> 38:42.366
Because, I'm sorry, Konstantin,
but I have no idea.

38:42.368 --> 38:44.868
Maybe I'm too simple to
understand you.

38:44.870 --> 38:46.837
What don't you understand?

38:46.839 --> 38:48.472
My play was a fiasco.

38:48.474 --> 38:51.308
Now you think
I'm some insignificant nobody

38:51.310 --> 38:52.878
just like the rest of them do!

38:54.313 --> 38:55.381
Nina!

38:58.783 --> 38:59.752
Nina!

39:11.763 --> 39:13.130
Oh, Sergei.

39:13.132 --> 39:14.767
- Oh.
- Oh, Sergei.

39:21.906 --> 39:23.943
Let me come and live with you.

39:24.910 --> 39:26.777
We're not young anymore.

39:26.779 --> 39:31.652
Let's end our days together
without having to hide.

39:32.752 --> 39:33.784
I'm 55.

39:35.621 --> 39:37.658
It's a little late to
change my life.

39:42.662 --> 39:45.430
It's because you have
other women, right?

39:47.300 --> 39:49.266
I'm not the only one.

39:49.268 --> 39:50.868
You can't invite all of us

39:50.870 --> 39:52.802
- to come and live with you.
- Oh, Polina...

39:52.804 --> 39:54.872
Oh, don't cry.

39:54.874 --> 39:56.007
I'm sorry.

39:58.544 --> 40:03.781
<i>The actress' brother
sleeps often, needs a haircut.</i>

40:03.783 --> 40:05.951
<i>Perpetually unhappy.</i>

40:15.796 --> 40:20.597
<i>The actress' son, wildly
jealous, fame-seeker...</i>

40:20.599 --> 40:23.000
You're always writing.

40:23.002 --> 40:26.437
Yes, well,
I am a man possessed.

40:26.439 --> 40:30.042
I must write. I must write.
I must write.

40:32.445 --> 40:35.011
He's still upset
about the play.

40:35.013 --> 40:37.648
Well, I'm a little bit upset
myself.

40:37.650 --> 40:40.850
Due to an unexpected event,
it seems we're leaving today.

40:40.852 --> 40:42.019
No.

40:42.021 --> 40:44.020
I wish I had more time.

40:44.022 --> 40:47.059
It's not often I have the occasion
to meet young, interesting women.

40:47.859 --> 40:50.027
I mean it.

40:50.029 --> 40:52.996
I've already forgotten
what it's like to be 18 or 19.

40:52.998 --> 40:55.031
That's why the young women
in my books and stories

40:55.033 --> 40:56.500
don't ring true.

40:56.502 --> 41:00.003
I'd love to be in your shoes
for just an hour,

41:00.005 --> 41:01.540
know how you think,

41:03.409 --> 41:06.042
what kind of little
creature you are.

41:06.044 --> 41:10.514
Well, I'd love to be
in your shoes,

41:10.516 --> 41:14.151
to know how it feels to be
a celebrated writer.

41:20.459 --> 41:21.427
Well?

41:22.461 --> 41:23.562
"Well," what?

41:24.196 --> 41:25.330
Are you coming?

42:44.610 --> 42:47.077
Eugenie?

42:47.079 --> 42:49.979
Something nicer
for this evening, I think.

42:49.981 --> 42:52.518
You wanted to be comfortable
for the journey back.

42:53.954 --> 42:55.955
Something nicer, I think.

42:57.589 --> 42:59.055
The lavender?

42:59.057 --> 43:00.091
Perfect.

43:01.961 --> 43:05.328
What does it feel like
to be famous?

43:05.330 --> 43:06.966
What does it feel like?

43:08.667 --> 43:11.267
Feels like not being famous, probably.
I never think about it.

43:11.269 --> 43:15.104
Well, what about when you read
about yourself in the newspapers?

43:15.106 --> 43:16.473
What does that feel like?

43:16.475 --> 43:19.977
Well, when they're flattering
notices, I like it.

43:19.979 --> 43:23.145
And when they're nasty, I'm
depressed for a day or two.

43:23.147 --> 43:29.519
If I were great like you, I'd
dedicate my whole life to my public.

43:29.521 --> 43:32.956
I'd let them pull my chariot
through the streets

43:32.958 --> 43:35.861
because I'd know
that it's the...

43:37.630 --> 43:41.030
They're reaching up to me.

43:41.032 --> 43:43.533
That's what makes them happy.

43:43.535 --> 43:45.302
And in a chariot, no less.

43:45.304 --> 43:47.238
So you're Cleopatra now?

43:49.875 --> 43:52.575
To have that feeling,

43:52.577 --> 43:56.212
I'd put up with family and
friends turning against me.

43:56.214 --> 44:02.151
I'd endure poverty. I'd live
on rye bread in a garret.

44:02.153 --> 44:06.056
But in return,
I would demand fame.

44:08.226 --> 44:10.128
Real, resounding fame.

44:12.263 --> 44:13.565
Have you seen Nina?

44:15.099 --> 44:16.901
She went to the lake
with Boris.

44:35.386 --> 44:37.355
Konstantin!

44:39.090 --> 44:40.291
Konstantin!

44:45.296 --> 44:47.265
Konstantin!

44:49.267 --> 44:52.201
I know
every little island.

44:52.203 --> 44:54.704
I've spent my whole life
on this lake.

44:54.706 --> 44:56.709
You live in a magical place.

44:59.410 --> 45:02.244
I envy you.

45:02.246 --> 45:08.116
Some people can barely crawl through
their dull, obscure existence,

45:08.118 --> 45:11.621
but you get a life
that's brilliant,

45:11.623 --> 45:14.290
interesting, meaningful.

45:14.292 --> 45:15.793
You're happy.

45:16.729 --> 45:18.761
Am I?

45:18.763 --> 45:21.297
Here you are talking
about fame, happiness...

45:21.299 --> 45:22.968
To me,
you sound a bit naive.

45:25.303 --> 45:27.538
Well, to me,
you sound jaded and pompous.

45:30.274 --> 45:31.175
All right.

45:32.310 --> 45:33.177
Wait. Come back.

45:34.145 --> 45:35.145
Wait.

45:37.750 --> 45:39.315
All right.

45:39.317 --> 45:41.620
Let's talk about my beautiful,
brilliant life.

45:43.621 --> 45:45.321
How do I begin?

45:45.323 --> 45:52.327
Day and night, I am haunted by
a single, obsessive thought.

45:52.329 --> 45:55.199
"I must write.
I must write. I must write."

45:56.567 --> 45:58.769
No sooner
do I finish one story,

45:58.771 --> 46:02.105
then, for God knows what reason,
I have to write another,

46:02.107 --> 46:04.740
and another, and another.

46:04.742 --> 46:06.609
What's so beautiful
and brilliant about that?

46:06.611 --> 46:08.179
It's a ridiculous life.

46:09.247 --> 46:10.780
Here I am.

46:10.782 --> 46:13.683
I'm talking to you.
I'm getting all riled up...

46:13.685 --> 46:15.386
You see that cloud
over there?

46:16.654 --> 46:19.355
Looks like a grand piano.

46:19.357 --> 46:22.458
I'm thinking, I must fit that
into a story sometime.

46:22.460 --> 46:25.229
"A cloud drifted by,
looking like a grand piano."

46:27.197 --> 46:29.001
I catch
a whiff of heliotrope.

46:30.101 --> 46:32.635
I instantly make
a mental note.

46:32.637 --> 46:36.439
"Cloying smell,
color of widow's weeds.

46:36.441 --> 46:39.410
"Must refer to that next time I'm
describing a summer's evening."

46:45.283 --> 46:46.217
Go on.

46:50.554 --> 46:52.221
Konstantin?

46:52.223 --> 46:53.291
Go away!

46:58.196 --> 47:00.431
- Ah! Beautiful day...
- Go away!

47:12.210 --> 47:13.676
We should get back.

47:13.678 --> 47:16.378
Well, we are going back.

47:16.380 --> 47:17.279
Yes.

47:17.281 --> 47:19.150
- That's what we're doing.
- Right.

47:25.690 --> 47:29.692
I should be able to relax
on a lake, forget myself.

47:29.694 --> 47:33.229
But even here,
I'm never left in peace.

47:33.231 --> 47:37.468
Well, we don't have to talk
if you'd prefer to...

47:40.872 --> 47:44.440
Konstantin is constantly in his
head, dreaming about his next work.

47:44.442 --> 47:48.277
Well, when I was his age,
many years ago,

47:48.279 --> 47:52.614
<i>when you're starting out,
unknown and ignored,</i>

47:52.616 --> 47:55.085
<i>the work is sheer agony.</i>

47:55.087 --> 47:58.821
<i>But even then, even when you're a
lesser writer without any luck,</i>

47:58.823 --> 48:01.624
<i>you still want to be part
of the literary scene.</i>

48:01.626 --> 48:09.132
<i>But when you're inspired,
actually in the thick of creation,</i>

48:09.134 --> 48:12.902
doesn't that give you,
just for that moment,

48:12.904 --> 48:17.942
a feeling of being lifted up,
of sublime happiness?

48:18.810 --> 48:20.443
Boris!

48:23.680 --> 48:25.316
I'm being summoned.

48:26.285 --> 48:28.119
To pack, no doubt.

48:30.353 --> 48:32.156
I wish I could stay.

48:38.129 --> 48:39.964
Boris Alexeyevich!

49:00.617 --> 49:01.718
What's this?

49:02.820 --> 49:04.588
Konstantin shot it.

49:05.990 --> 49:07.457
Beautiful bird.

49:12.462 --> 49:14.364
Can't you convince her
to stay?

49:16.567 --> 49:17.501
Boris?

49:19.937 --> 49:21.502
What are you writing?

49:21.504 --> 49:25.406
An idea for a short story.

49:25.408 --> 49:31.216
A young girl who spent her whole
life on the shore of a lake.

49:32.183 --> 49:34.085
A lake that she loves,

49:35.652 --> 49:39.156
where she feels
happy and free,

49:40.124 --> 49:41.392
like a seagull.

49:42.826 --> 49:43.828
And?

49:45.528 --> 49:50.366
And by chance,
a man comes along,

49:50.368 --> 49:51.769
sees her.

49:54.739 --> 49:56.604
And with nothing
better to do...

49:56.606 --> 49:58.609
Boris Alexeyevich!

50:31.608 --> 50:33.910
Foolish, foolish boy.

50:40.016 --> 50:42.217
<i>I'll be honest with you.</i>

50:42.219 --> 50:45.256
If he had seriously hurt
himself,

50:46.590 --> 50:48.491
I couldn't live
another minute.

50:51.295 --> 50:52.629
I have decided

50:54.698 --> 51:00.069
I am going to tear this love
out of my heart.

51:00.071 --> 51:02.974
Just going to rip it out

51:04.607 --> 51:06.474
by the roots.

51:06.476 --> 51:08.144
How are you gonna do that?

51:08.912 --> 51:11.247
I'll get married

51:12.816 --> 51:14.684
to Medvedenko.

51:16.653 --> 51:18.553
I think that's overdoing it.

51:19.656 --> 51:20.758
Is it?

51:23.294 --> 51:24.627
Loving without hope.

51:28.031 --> 51:31.534
Waiting for years for something
that will never come.

51:34.971 --> 51:37.540
You don't know
what I've been feeling.

51:39.876 --> 51:42.577
At least, when I'm married,

51:42.579 --> 51:45.813
I'll have new troubles to
blot out the old ones, right?

51:45.815 --> 51:47.483
Whoa, whoa.

51:47.485 --> 51:50.252
- Anything for a change.
- No, no, no.

51:50.254 --> 51:53.521
The schoolteacher's
not very smart.

51:53.523 --> 51:55.656
- No, no, no!
- But he's a good person, and...

51:55.658 --> 51:58.526
- Well, he doesn't have any money, but...
- No, no, no. Stay.

51:58.528 --> 52:00.331
Good boy. Good boy.

52:03.900 --> 52:05.835
He loves me very much.

52:23.053 --> 52:25.655
Don't look at me like that.

52:28.392 --> 52:31.326
A lot of women drink.

52:31.328 --> 52:33.563
Just not as openly as I do.

52:36.665 --> 52:37.801
Here's to you.

52:39.903 --> 52:41.372
You're a good person.

52:42.839 --> 52:44.205
I'm sorry you're leaving.

52:44.207 --> 52:45.673
Me, too.

52:45.675 --> 52:48.510
I don't want to go.

52:48.512 --> 52:50.711
- Then ask her to stay.
- No, no.

52:50.713 --> 52:52.849
Not while her son
is being a...

52:56.019 --> 52:59.720
Not content with ruining his own life,
he's hell-bent on ruining mine.

52:59.722 --> 53:00.990
He's challenged me to a duel.

53:03.561 --> 53:05.396
Oh, no.

53:05.795 --> 53:07.395
Why?

53:07.397 --> 53:08.930
Because of my writing?

53:08.932 --> 53:10.967
There's room enough
for all of us.

53:11.634 --> 53:13.237
Of course.

53:15.371 --> 53:16.773
But he's jealous.

53:20.743 --> 53:22.278
You must know that.

53:28.218 --> 53:30.787
Not that it's any
of my business.

53:41.431 --> 53:44.765
Until next time, my friend.

53:44.767 --> 53:48.768
Send me your books, and be
sure to write a dedication.

53:48.770 --> 53:52.273
And none of that "deepest
regards" or "fond wishes."

53:52.275 --> 53:55.877
Just write, "To Masha,

53:55.879 --> 53:58.516
"who has no clue
where she belongs

54:01.585 --> 54:03.820
"or what she's
doing on this Earth."

54:13.930 --> 54:15.064
Excuse me.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.101
Pick a hand.

54:21.237 --> 54:22.836
This one means no.

54:22.838 --> 54:26.474
I'm trying to decide whether
or not to go on the stage.

54:26.476 --> 54:28.976
I wish someone would tell me
what to do.

54:28.978 --> 54:32.715
Well, that's not something
somebody can decide for you.

54:34.652 --> 54:36.319
I have a little gift for you.

54:39.155 --> 54:40.687
What is it?

54:40.689 --> 54:42.857
Something to remember me by.

54:42.859 --> 54:44.691
I've had your initials
engraved on it,

54:44.693 --> 54:47.830
and, on the other side, the
title of one of your books.

54:51.067 --> 54:52.469
That is very sweet of you.

54:53.469 --> 54:55.303
Boris!

54:55.305 --> 54:57.540
Give me two minutes
before you go.

54:59.876 --> 55:01.708
- Why lines 11 and 12?
- Boris!

55:01.710 --> 55:06.347
Just two minutes
in the solarium, please.

55:06.349 --> 55:09.717
<i>♪ Two grenadiers
Were riding to France</i>

55:09.719 --> 55:12.920
<i>♪ Home from their prisons
in Russia ♪</i>

55:15.058 --> 55:16.757
I once started
to sing like that.

55:16.759 --> 55:18.893
One of the assistant
prosecutors said to me,

55:18.895 --> 55:22.530
"You have a very powerful
voice, Your Excellency."

55:22.532 --> 55:24.864
Then he stopped for a moment,
and he thought,

55:24.866 --> 55:26.567
"Powerful, but horrible."

55:26.569 --> 55:28.134
Mmm-hmm.

55:28.136 --> 55:30.838
Who was that that you were
talking to? Nina?

55:30.840 --> 55:33.341
- Yes.
- Ah.

55:33.343 --> 55:35.343
Why do you keep
hobbling around everywhere

55:35.345 --> 55:36.744
if your joints are aching?

55:40.283 --> 55:41.716
So what's that?

55:41.718 --> 55:43.719
Oh, it's just a...

55:45.754 --> 55:47.623
Do you have any of my books
in the house?

55:47.625 --> 55:48.888
I need to look something up.

55:48.890 --> 55:52.127
Uh, in the study.
Corner bookcase.

55:58.234 --> 56:00.568
You don't have to travel with
us. Why don't you stay here?

56:00.570 --> 56:02.570
You'll feel better.

56:02.572 --> 56:05.006
No, no, no. Not with you going away.
It's depressing here without you.

56:05.008 --> 56:06.741
Well, what are you
going to do in town?

56:06.743 --> 56:07.977
Nothing much.

56:10.779 --> 56:12.779
How is the patient?

56:12.781 --> 56:15.851
<i>He's better.
He's resting.</i>

56:17.820 --> 56:19.986
He's unhappy, you know.

56:19.988 --> 56:22.856
I know he's unhappy.
He shot himself.

56:22.858 --> 56:25.761
I know he's not well. How do
you think that makes me feel?

56:25.763 --> 56:27.628
- All right, relax.
- I'm going away,

56:27.630 --> 56:29.398
and I still don't know
why he tried to...

56:32.201 --> 56:35.569
I think jealousy's
the main reason, but I...

56:35.571 --> 56:38.572
So the sooner I take Boris
away from here, the better.

56:38.574 --> 56:39.875
It's not the only reason.

56:41.477 --> 56:43.143
He's a young, intelligent man.

56:43.145 --> 56:45.980
He's living in the country
with no money of his own,

56:45.982 --> 56:47.615
no clear occupation,
no future.

56:47.617 --> 56:50.016
He's... He's frightened.

56:50.018 --> 56:52.420
- You're going to upset me.
- Listen to me, Irina, honey.

56:52.422 --> 56:54.988
He thinks he's unwanted.

56:54.990 --> 56:59.593
Even here, he feels like a charity case.
Give him some money.

56:59.595 --> 57:04.331
I see. If only I weren't so stingy,
and if only you were living in town,

57:04.333 --> 57:06.000
then we'd all be happy.

57:06.002 --> 57:09.303
I'm the reason for your misery
these past 20 years.

57:09.305 --> 57:11.706
It's all my fault. Right?

57:11.708 --> 57:14.841
I've only been miserable
the past 10.

57:17.714 --> 57:21.381
My son is capable
of getting a job on his own.

57:21.383 --> 57:24.018
- A desk job or something.
- Give him some money!

57:24.020 --> 57:25.952
Let him go abroad for a bit,
enjoy himself.

57:25.954 --> 57:27.921
Going abroad would
cost a fortune,

57:27.923 --> 57:30.091
and I'm not even sure I could
afford a new suit for him.

57:30.093 --> 57:32.462
Of course,
I believe you.

57:33.496 --> 57:34.829
Stop that!

57:34.831 --> 57:37.997
Oh, you're a generous,
magnanimous woman.

57:37.999 --> 57:39.367
I have no money.

57:39.369 --> 57:41.468
If I had money,
I'd give it to him.

57:41.470 --> 57:44.871
I know. You're destitute.
Generous, but destitute.

57:44.873 --> 57:46.674
I am an actress.
My costume bills alone

57:46.676 --> 57:49.077
- are enough to ruin me.
- I respect you.

57:51.047 --> 57:52.381
Petrushka?

57:56.819 --> 58:00.523
Help! Someone, help!

58:01.124 --> 58:02.989
Help!

58:02.991 --> 58:07.060
Are you all right? Wake up.
Help! Somebody.

58:07.062 --> 58:08.462
It's all right,
Mama. It's okay.

58:08.464 --> 58:09.864
- He's... He's...
- He's all right.

58:09.866 --> 58:11.265
Uncle has
these fainting spells.

58:11.267 --> 58:12.565
- It's nothing serious.
- He's all right.

58:12.567 --> 58:14.000
He should go lie down.
Will you take him?

58:14.002 --> 58:15.269
Yeah.

58:15.271 --> 58:17.705
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

58:17.707 --> 58:19.774
Here's a riddle for you.

58:19.776 --> 58:22.109
What goes around
in the morning on all fours,

58:22.111 --> 58:25.379
at midday on two,
in the evening on three...

58:25.381 --> 58:27.313
And at night
on your back. It's all right.

58:27.315 --> 58:29.085
I can walk. I can walk!

58:30.520 --> 58:32.420
Don't look at me
like that.

58:32.422 --> 58:34.390
Living in the country
isn't good for him, Mama.

58:37.527 --> 58:40.326
For God's sake, why won't you
give him some money?

58:40.328 --> 58:42.063
I am an actress,
not a banker.

58:45.802 --> 58:47.770
Mama, living in the country
gets him down.

58:51.273 --> 58:52.473
I heard you.

58:52.475 --> 58:55.543
But I...

58:55.545 --> 58:57.312
The Doctor's late. I'm...

58:59.382 --> 59:01.149
Will you change my bandage?

59:03.920 --> 59:05.822
No one does it
better than you.

59:13.028 --> 59:14.963
Get the box
with the dressings.

59:23.739 --> 59:27.976
"If you ever have need of
my life, come and take it."

59:44.327 --> 59:46.660
You look like somebody
in a turban.

59:46.662 --> 59:48.528
Last night, Olga saw
you walk by.

59:48.530 --> 59:50.598
She wanted to know
what country you were from.

59:53.970 --> 59:55.002
Oh, well.

01:00:00.743 --> 01:00:01.977
There we go.

01:00:02.945 --> 01:00:04.179
There we are.

01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:07.781
Oh.

01:00:07.783 --> 01:00:09.749
It's practically healed.

01:00:09.751 --> 01:00:12.354
Barely a week, and there's
just a tiny bruise left.

01:00:16.993 --> 01:00:21.127
Now, promise me
there'll be no more of...

01:00:21.129 --> 01:00:24.332
Of this, while I'm gone?

01:00:25.634 --> 01:00:26.701
Promise?

01:00:27.904 --> 01:00:29.036
Promise.

01:00:30.639 --> 01:00:34.173
I just went mad for a moment.
It won't happen again.

01:00:34.175 --> 01:00:35.210
All right.

01:00:42.685 --> 01:00:44.183
Oh...

01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:45.053
Sorry.

01:00:49.157 --> 01:00:52.460
You remember when you were
working at the Imperial?

01:00:54.062 --> 01:00:56.496
I was a little boy,
and there was...

01:00:56.498 --> 01:00:59.098
There was a fight in the
courtyard where we were living.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.500
Do you...

01:01:00.502 --> 01:01:02.235
A washer woman in our
building got badly hurt.

01:01:02.237 --> 01:01:03.836
Do you remember that?

01:01:03.838 --> 01:01:06.205
Mmm, no.

01:01:06.207 --> 01:01:08.842
She was out cold
when they picked her up.

01:01:08.844 --> 01:01:09.845
Hmm.

01:01:11.646 --> 01:01:13.682
You were always
going in to see her.

01:01:16.018 --> 01:01:18.885
You used to
bring her medicine,

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:22.121
and you used to wash her
children in her washtub.

01:01:22.123 --> 01:01:23.691
You don't remember that?

01:01:23.693 --> 01:01:24.659
No.

01:01:27.195 --> 01:01:30.897
There were two ballerinas living
in our building at the time.

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:32.765
They used to come in
and have coffee.

01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:34.569
Oh, that, I remember.

01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:37.238
They were so religious.

01:01:48.282 --> 01:01:49.818
These last few days,

01:01:52.219 --> 01:01:57.192
I've loved you as tenderly and as
honestly as I did when I was little.

01:02:00.562 --> 01:02:02.129
I have nobody but you now.

01:02:04.165 --> 01:02:06.166
I just don't understand why...

01:02:07.903 --> 01:02:10.906
Why do you let that man
have such a hold over you?

01:02:14.209 --> 01:02:17.911
You don't know him, Konstantin.
He's noble.

01:02:17.913 --> 01:02:19.746
- "Noble"?
- And you might not like

01:02:19.748 --> 01:02:23.349
the fact that we're lovers, but
you're intelligent and cultured.

01:02:23.351 --> 01:02:25.251
I'm sorry.

01:02:25.253 --> 01:02:27.988
But we're practically
falling out over him,

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:31.357
and right now,
he's in the garden with Nina,

01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:33.993
trying to convince her
that he's some sort of genius.

01:02:33.995 --> 01:02:37.730
You seem to take pleasure
in being horrible to me.

01:02:37.732 --> 01:02:39.331
I have the greatest respect
for that man,

01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:41.401
and I will thank you
not to speak of him like that

01:02:41.403 --> 01:02:43.437
- in my presence.
- But I don't respect him.

01:02:44.406 --> 01:02:46.238
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.207
His books are...

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:50.308
They make me sick.

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.512
That's envy.

01:02:52.514 --> 01:02:55.648
People who lack talent spend their
time insulting those who have it.

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:57.349
It's their consolation prize.

01:02:57.351 --> 01:02:58.384
Is that why you
spend all your time

01:02:58.386 --> 01:03:00.352
- insulting me?
- No.

01:03:00.354 --> 01:03:01.654
- Because you have no talent?
- You're just being a baby.

01:03:01.656 --> 01:03:03.321
Why? Because I'm not taken in
by either of you?

01:03:03.323 --> 01:03:05.224
Oh, yes, yes.
My son, the radical.

01:03:05.226 --> 01:03:07.192
Yeah, then go on,
that's it. Run away.

01:03:07.194 --> 01:03:08.995
Run away just like
you always do.

01:03:08.997 --> 01:03:10.495
Run off to
your cozy little theater

01:03:10.497 --> 01:03:12.665
and act in your pathetic,
stupid little plays.

01:03:12.667 --> 01:03:15.702
I have never in my life
appeared in a play of that description.

01:03:15.704 --> 01:03:19.138
I do as many celebrated classics
as I do silly comedies.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.639
This winter, I'm touring
in <i>Macbeth.</i>

01:03:20.641 --> 01:03:21.808
Are you one of the witches?

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.409
I'm Lady Macbeth.

01:03:23.411 --> 01:03:25.411
Snide little nonentity.
Get away from me.

01:03:25.413 --> 01:03:28.648
You, you can't even write a
wretched little comic sketch.

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:31.383
Why don't you just go back
to Kiev and open a shop?

01:03:31.385 --> 01:03:32.752
- Parasite.
- Miser.

01:03:32.754 --> 01:03:34.987
- Rat's nest!
- Has-been!

01:03:34.989 --> 01:03:36.925
Nobody! You're nobody!

01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:07.956
Crybaby.

01:04:15.262 --> 01:04:16.463
Please don't cry.

01:04:19.067 --> 01:04:20.199
Please don't.

01:04:20.201 --> 01:04:21.603
There's nothing to cry about.

01:04:33.114 --> 01:04:34.647
He's going away.

01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:36.082
I promise.

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:39.551
I am taking him away.

01:04:39.553 --> 01:04:42.290
And then she'll love you
again, and it'll be all right.

01:04:44.025 --> 01:04:45.126
I promise.

01:04:47.929 --> 01:04:49.095
There.

01:04:54.035 --> 01:04:55.270
You're all right?

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:58.070
All right?

01:04:58.072 --> 01:04:59.374
We're friends again?

01:05:00.307 --> 01:05:01.375
I'm sorry.

01:05:02.644 --> 01:05:04.309
It's okay, Mama.

01:05:04.311 --> 01:05:06.280
And you'll make up
with Boris.

01:05:06.282 --> 01:05:08.480
I mean, there's really no need
to fight with him, is there?

01:05:08.482 --> 01:05:11.349
Mama, please.
Please don't make me see him.

01:05:11.351 --> 01:05:14.086
- All right, all right.
- I'm... I can't.

01:05:14.088 --> 01:05:15.655
All right.

01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:17.758
I'll be by the lake
until he's gone.

01:05:33.608 --> 01:05:37.544
<i>"If you ever have need
of my life, come and take it."</i>

01:06:10.544 --> 01:06:12.143
How was your morning?

01:06:12.145 --> 01:06:13.246
Oh.

01:06:15.382 --> 01:06:18.217
Irina? You upset?

01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:20.887
I'm fine, my love.
It's just time to go.

01:06:20.889 --> 01:06:22.487
That's all.

01:06:22.489 --> 01:06:24.659
Well, what if we...

01:06:27.328 --> 01:06:28.693
What if we what?

01:06:28.695 --> 01:06:30.530
What if we stay one more day?

01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:37.203
Darling, why can't we stay?

01:06:38.572 --> 01:06:44.609
Because, darling, um,
I know why you want to stay,

01:06:44.611 --> 01:06:47.646
but get control of yourself.

01:06:47.648 --> 01:06:50.515
You're
a little drunk.

01:06:50.517 --> 01:06:51.752
Sober up.

01:06:53.854 --> 01:06:54.889
No.

01:06:57.491 --> 01:06:58.625
Be reasonable.

01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:02.695
You're capable of sacrifice.

01:07:02.697 --> 01:07:04.064
Be a true friend.

01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:07.467
Please, be generous.

01:07:08.568 --> 01:07:10.402
Let me go.

01:07:10.404 --> 01:07:12.470
"Be generous"?

01:07:12.472 --> 01:07:14.641
What, are you that infatuated
with her?

01:07:16.443 --> 01:07:18.411
I'm attracted to her. I...

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:20.479
This could be what's
missing in my life.

01:07:21.581 --> 01:07:22.781
What?

01:07:22.783 --> 01:07:25.884
The love of
a little country girl?

01:07:25.886 --> 01:07:28.887
That's how little you know
yourself?

01:07:28.889 --> 01:07:31.589
I can't stop thinking
about her. Even now,

01:07:31.591 --> 01:07:33.292
I'm talking with you,

01:07:33.294 --> 01:07:35.226
- but it's as if I'm asleep.
- No.

01:07:35.228 --> 01:07:37.461
- Stop, please.
- I'm possessed by the thought of her.

01:07:37.463 --> 01:07:39.831
This could be my last chance
at a love like this.

01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:41.066
Please, I am begging you.

01:07:41.068 --> 01:07:42.335
- Let me go.
- No.

01:07:42.337 --> 01:07:43.468
- Let me go.
- No, no, no.

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:45.305
You can't say those things
to me, Boris.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.074
I'm just a woman
like any other.

01:07:49.076 --> 01:07:51.209
This is your chance to be
a woman unlike any other.

01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:54.913
You're torturing me.
Please, you're scaring me.

01:07:54.915 --> 01:07:56.648
I've never known love
like this before.

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:59.418
When I was young, I spent every
minute struggling to survive,

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:01.987
and now it's in front of me,
a love I've never known,

01:08:01.989 --> 01:08:03.456
and you want me to
run away from it?

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.892
- You have lost your mind.
- I don't care!

01:08:07.862 --> 01:08:10.697
- Please, let me go.
- Oh.

01:08:22.642 --> 01:08:24.509
My dear,

01:08:24.511 --> 01:08:27.714
my darling, wonderful man.

01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:34.720
My life's last page.

01:08:39.059 --> 01:08:43.395
If you leave me even
for an instant,

01:08:43.397 --> 01:08:45.399
I just won't be alive
at the end of it.

01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:52.304
My magician. My prince.

01:08:52.305 --> 01:08:55.140
My king in all his glory.

01:08:55.142 --> 01:08:57.142
- Somebody could come in at any minute.
- Let them.

01:08:57.144 --> 01:09:01.014
I'm not ashamed of loving you,
and I am not setting you free.

01:09:04.818 --> 01:09:09.188
You are the most brilliant
writer in Russia.

01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:13.524
Your work has such integrity
and simplicity and humor.

01:09:13.527 --> 01:09:16.693
Your characters are alive.

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:18.395
Do you realize that it is

01:09:18.398 --> 01:09:22.736
impossible to read you without
getting swept up?

01:09:25.005 --> 01:09:27.841
What? You think
I'm flattering you.

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:31.111
Look at me.

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:34.346
Look into my eyes.

01:09:36.317 --> 01:09:38.251
Am I lying to you?

01:09:48.594 --> 01:09:54.600
I'm the only one who always
tells you the truth.

01:09:55.368 --> 01:09:56.471
Always.

01:09:59.773 --> 01:10:02.073
You'll come with me,
won't you?

01:10:02.075 --> 01:10:03.777
Don't abandon me.

01:10:10.417 --> 01:10:12.683
I have no will of my own.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.186
Never have.

01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:21.660
I'm spineless, weak,
submissive.

01:10:26.099 --> 01:10:28.566
Is that what women
really want?

01:10:28.568 --> 01:10:30.602
Take me. Take me away.

01:10:30.604 --> 01:10:33.406
Just don't relax your grip
for an instant.

01:10:40.679 --> 01:10:42.112
You're mine.

01:10:53.927 --> 01:10:56.494
Of course, you should stay
if you want to.

01:10:56.496 --> 01:10:58.129
I can always go into town,

01:10:58.131 --> 01:10:59.863
and you could come
in a week or so.

01:10:59.865 --> 01:11:01.099
There's no hurry.

01:11:01.101 --> 01:11:02.735
No, no, no, we'll go together.

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:05.672
Whatever you want.

01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:13.110
Goodbye, my lady.

01:11:13.112 --> 01:11:16.747
If anything was not as it
should be, please forgive me.

01:11:16.749 --> 01:11:18.816
Everything was
just right.

01:11:18.818 --> 01:11:20.287
Don't cry.

01:11:21.988 --> 01:11:24.422
Our days are passing.

01:11:24.424 --> 01:11:25.725
What's to be done?

01:11:26.527 --> 01:11:28.092
Hmm?

01:11:28.094 --> 01:11:32.263
Well, if we live,
we'll meet again next summer.

01:11:32.265 --> 01:11:34.031
Don't forget me.

01:11:34.033 --> 01:11:36.100
Goodbye, ma'am, and
may God bless you.

01:11:36.102 --> 01:11:37.069
Aw.

01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:41.738
Remember me fondly.
Here's a ruble.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.510
It's for
the three of you.

01:11:44.743 --> 01:11:46.878
My lady, for your trip.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.346
Oh!

01:11:48.348 --> 01:11:52.550
Thank you. Thank you.

01:11:52.552 --> 01:11:56.888
Oh, I think I forgot my walking stick.
I know where it is. Excuse me.

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:57.721
- Excuse me.
- Don't be long.

01:11:57.723 --> 01:11:58.757
Excuse me.

01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:18.875
We're leaving.

01:12:18.877 --> 01:12:20.545
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

01:12:20.547 --> 01:12:22.547
We'll see each other again.

01:12:22.549 --> 01:12:25.048
I've made up my mind
once and for all.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:26.718
I'm going on the stage.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.553
Tomorrow,
I'll be gone from here.

01:12:28.555 --> 01:12:32.256
I'm leaving my father.
I'm leaving everything.

01:12:32.258 --> 01:12:34.492
I'm going to start a new life.

01:12:34.494 --> 01:12:36.527
I'm going to Moscow.

01:12:36.529 --> 01:12:38.531
Sir,
the carriage is waiting!

01:12:41.201 --> 01:12:43.501
Stay at the Slavyansky Bazaar.

01:12:43.503 --> 01:12:45.471
Let me know as soon as
you arrive.

01:12:47.773 --> 01:12:49.775
- I have to go.
- Just another minute.

01:12:51.745 --> 01:12:53.145
You're so beautiful.

01:14:22.868 --> 01:14:24.101
Coming through.

01:14:24.103 --> 01:14:25.537
Uh, I have your carriage
ready, sir.

01:14:30.042 --> 01:14:31.009
Hi.

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:33.145
It's your brother.

01:14:45.023 --> 01:14:46.490
Haven't
we done enough already?

01:14:46.492 --> 01:14:48.191
Come on. He didn't
ask you to stay.

01:14:48.193 --> 01:14:50.762
I need to help Mama.
I'm not leaving.

01:14:50.764 --> 01:14:52.863
Please, let's go home, Masha.

01:14:52.865 --> 01:14:54.231
No.

01:14:54.233 --> 01:14:55.665
- I'm staying the night.
- Masha, let's go.

01:14:55.667 --> 01:14:57.234
The baby's probably hungry.

01:14:57.236 --> 01:14:59.669
Go yourself. The nurse
will feed him anyway.

01:14:59.671 --> 01:15:01.506
I'd rather spend the night.

01:15:01.508 --> 01:15:02.574
Again?

01:15:04.878 --> 01:15:06.743
- So you'll come tomorrow, then?
- Yes.

01:15:06.745 --> 01:15:08.548
Yes. Tomorrow.

01:15:27.266 --> 01:15:29.101
My heart aches for you.

01:15:30.335 --> 01:15:31.603
I'm not blind.

01:15:33.938 --> 01:15:35.274
Please don't.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:38.210
It's all ridiculous.

01:15:43.383 --> 01:15:45.150
Unrequited love.

01:15:46.553 --> 01:15:49.587
It only exists in novels.

01:15:49.589 --> 01:15:54.156
You can't sit around always hoping
that something will happen.

01:15:54.158 --> 01:15:57.794
If you start to feel love in
your heart,

01:15:57.796 --> 01:15:59.131
you've got to rip it out.

01:16:09.776 --> 01:16:11.408
Who would have
thought, Konstantin,

01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:13.109
that there was a
proper writer in you?

01:16:13.111 --> 01:16:14.977
And now, thank the Lord,

01:16:14.979 --> 01:16:16.646
you're starting to get money
from the magazines.

01:16:16.648 --> 01:16:18.049
What do you want, Polina?

01:16:20.152 --> 01:16:22.986
I want you to be nicer
to my little Masha, please.

01:16:22.988 --> 01:16:24.154
Leave him alone, Mama.

01:16:24.156 --> 01:16:26.122
- She's a good girl.
- Mama!

01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:28.391
Women only require
a kind glance

01:16:28.393 --> 01:16:30.126
- now and then, Kostya.
- Leave him alone!

01:16:30.128 --> 01:16:31.795
- I should know.
- Now you've annoyed him.

01:16:31.797 --> 01:16:33.532
What did you have
to bother him for?

01:16:37.436 --> 01:16:39.001
Sorin asked that we
make up his bed in here.

01:16:39.003 --> 01:16:41.972
- He wants to be close to Kostya.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:16:41.974 --> 01:16:43.642
Thank you, Yakov.

01:16:45.143 --> 01:16:47.110
Where's my sister?

01:16:47.112 --> 01:16:49.815
Shamrayev went to the theater.
She'll be here any minute.

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.618
I'm gonna miss this old world.

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.453
I wish...

01:16:56.455 --> 01:16:57.989
I wish I had seen more of it.

01:16:57.991 --> 01:17:00.055
No, don't talk nonsense.

01:17:00.057 --> 01:17:01.893
Well, you've seen more of it
than I have.

01:17:01.895 --> 01:17:05.931
What city did you like best
of all your travels?

01:17:06.698 --> 01:17:08.198
Hmm.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.067
Genoa.

01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:12.168
Why Genoa?

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:15.639
Oh, when you walk out
of your hotel in the evening,

01:17:15.641 --> 01:17:19.475
the streets are swarming
with people.

01:17:19.477 --> 01:17:24.046
You drift along with the crowd
this way and that, back and forth.

01:17:24.048 --> 01:17:26.216
It's got a life of its own.

01:17:26.218 --> 01:17:31.488
You become part of it,
body and soul.

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:35.661
You start to think there really
might be a universal spirit,

01:17:37.029 --> 01:17:40.032
like the one Nina
acted in your play.

01:17:42.869 --> 01:17:45.069
Where is Nina now, Kostya?
How's she doing?

01:17:46.905 --> 01:17:48.540
She's all right, I think.

01:17:51.142 --> 01:17:55.679
I heard she'd been leading
a somewhat untidy life.

01:17:55.681 --> 01:17:56.883
Nina's, uh...

01:17:58.951 --> 01:18:00.285
It's a very long story.

01:18:01.085 --> 01:18:02.888
Well, make it brief.

01:18:07.425 --> 01:18:10.093
Well, she left home

01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:12.598
and went to live with Boris,
so that much you know.

01:18:14.766 --> 01:18:16.234
They had a baby,

01:18:17.569 --> 01:18:18.570
who died.

01:18:20.974 --> 01:18:24.343
Not long after,
Boris got tired of her.

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:28.878
He went back to his old ties,
as you might expect,

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.281
or rather he never
let go of them.

01:18:32.283 --> 01:18:36.320
Having no backbone,
he was able to bend both ways.

01:18:38.123 --> 01:18:40.256
And what about the stage?

01:18:40.258 --> 01:18:44.094
She debuted in a theater
outside of Moscow,

01:18:44.096 --> 01:18:46.098
then left for a tour
of the provinces.

01:18:47.933 --> 01:18:52.336
She took on all the big roles,
but she acted coarsely.

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.138
Tastelessly.

01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.909
Lots of shrieking
and big, ugly gestures.

01:18:59.577 --> 01:19:02.344
<i>There were moments
when you could see her talent,</i>

01:19:02.346 --> 01:19:08.251
when she was crying or dying.

01:19:08.253 --> 01:19:11.521
I tried to see her once
after a performance.

01:19:11.523 --> 01:19:14.791
<i>I waited at her stage door
like a beggar,</i>

01:19:14.793 --> 01:19:16.193
but she won't see anyone.

01:19:20.666 --> 01:19:22.932
Oh, I think they're here.

01:19:22.934 --> 01:19:25.200
Masha, come with me.

01:19:25.202 --> 01:19:27.471
- Ma'am.
- Oh, Polina.

01:19:29.007 --> 01:19:30.508
- Sir.
- Good evening.

01:19:32.944 --> 01:19:35.578
- Masha.
- You recognized me.

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.579
- You're married now?
- Yes.

01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:39.451
- You're happy?
- I'm married.

01:19:46.525 --> 01:19:48.794
- Kostya.
- Hello, Mother.

01:19:49.995 --> 01:19:51.695
Look at you.

01:19:51.697 --> 01:19:55.230
- How is he?
- How am I?

01:19:55.232 --> 01:19:58.134
They found it necessary
to write for you to come,

01:19:58.136 --> 01:19:59.738
so I must be seriously ill.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:07.676
Konstantin, I have an idea
for your next story.

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:11.580
A good title for it would be,
"The Man Who Wanted To."

01:20:11.582 --> 01:20:14.216
Years ago, when I was
a young man, I...

01:20:14.218 --> 01:20:17.221
I wanted to become a writer.

01:20:18.656 --> 01:20:20.390
I never did.

01:20:20.392 --> 01:20:23.827
I wanted...

01:20:23.829 --> 01:20:27.365
I wanted to be a good speaker.
I was terrible.

01:20:28.432 --> 01:20:30.435
I wanted to be married.

01:20:32.403 --> 01:20:34.471
I never married.

01:20:34.473 --> 01:20:39.042
I wanted to live in town,

01:20:39.044 --> 01:20:43.378
and now I'm dying in the
country.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.616
And there you have it.

01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:53.223
Konstantin?

01:20:53.225 --> 01:20:54.858
Your mother tells me you're
not angry with me anymore.

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:57.761
Boris brought the magazine
with your new story in it.

01:20:57.763 --> 01:20:58.929
Show him.

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:03.066
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

01:21:03.068 --> 01:21:05.934
While Sorin is resting,
why don't we play a game?

01:21:05.936 --> 01:21:09.271
- Should I get the lotto set, Mama?
- Yes, dear.

01:21:09.273 --> 01:21:12.910
You have many fans in Moscow.
Everyone's always asking about you.

01:21:17.249 --> 01:21:18.917
And did you like the story?

01:21:20.919 --> 01:21:23.287
I'm planning on reading it
on the train back to Moscow.

01:21:24.488 --> 01:21:26.123
So you'll be leaving soon?

01:21:27.259 --> 01:21:28.459
Tomorrow, probably.

01:21:32.264 --> 01:21:34.563
Polina, how can I help?

01:21:34.565 --> 01:21:35.732
I think we're ready.

01:21:35.734 --> 01:21:36.734
Yes.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:40.270
Boris, come.

01:21:40.272 --> 01:21:42.739
We never played when you
were here in the summer.

01:21:42.741 --> 01:21:45.541
We usually play lotto
when the long nights set in.

01:21:45.543 --> 01:21:47.442
This is my mother's old set.

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:50.279
It's a stupid game, but after
a while, you don't notice.

01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:54.750
Kostya. Shut the window.
It's drafty.

01:21:54.752 --> 01:21:57.386
You should have heard the
reception they gave me tonight.

01:21:57.388 --> 01:21:58.754
Oh!

01:21:58.756 --> 01:22:01.323
My God, my head's
still spinning from it.

01:22:01.325 --> 01:22:03.293
Are you in, Konstantin?

01:22:03.295 --> 01:22:05.360
No, Mama. If you don't
mind, I'm going to work for a bit.

01:22:05.362 --> 01:22:08.864
The stake is ten kopecks. You'll
put in for me, won't you, Doctor?

01:22:08.866 --> 01:22:10.300
Certainly.

01:22:10.302 --> 01:22:12.036
- Have we all put in?
- I'm in.

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:20.375
Twenty-two.

01:22:20.377 --> 01:22:22.544
The ovation went
on and on.

01:22:22.546 --> 01:22:24.713
Eighty-eight.

01:22:24.715 --> 01:22:27.783
Three baskets
of flowers, two bouquets.

01:22:27.785 --> 01:22:29.319
Thirty-four.

01:22:29.321 --> 01:22:30.686
And how about
this marvelous ensemble?

01:22:30.688 --> 01:22:32.521
Sunshine.

01:22:32.523 --> 01:22:34.523
If I know nothing else,
I know how to dress.

01:22:38.762 --> 01:22:41.529
Konstantin's playing.

01:22:41.531 --> 01:22:43.933
He must be unhappy.
Poor lad.

01:22:43.935 --> 01:22:46.302
They've been having a go
at him in the newspapers.

01:22:46.304 --> 01:22:47.669
Seventy-seven.

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:49.538
He can't seem
to find his own voice.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:52.307
There's something oddly
unfocused about his writing.

01:22:52.309 --> 01:22:53.609
Well, I believe in
Konstantin.

01:22:53.611 --> 01:22:56.478
There's something there.
He thinks in images.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.616
His stories are striking. I'm
affected by them. Aren't you?

01:23:00.618 --> 01:23:03.452
Can you believe I still
haven't read a word of his writing?

01:23:03.454 --> 01:23:05.221
There's just never any time.

01:23:05.223 --> 01:23:06.257
Eight.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:10.261
Eighty-one.

01:23:17.668 --> 01:23:19.070
Twenty-eight.

01:23:40.024 --> 01:23:41.423
Twenty-six.

01:23:58.776 --> 01:24:00.441
Lock the doors in case
anybody comes in.

01:24:00.443 --> 01:24:02.044
Don't worry.
No one will come in.

01:24:02.046 --> 01:24:04.447
I know your mother's here.
Lock the door.

01:24:13.824 --> 01:24:15.324
<i>Fourteen.</i>

01:24:15.326 --> 01:24:18.126
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>
- <i>Twenty-six.</i>

01:24:18.128 --> 01:24:19.895
<i>Twenty-six! Wait.</i>

01:24:19.897 --> 01:24:21.263
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:22.464
- <i>it's my game.</i>
- <i>Aw.</i>

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:25.466
<i>One away.
I was just so close.</i>

01:24:25.468 --> 01:24:27.469
Your mother brought him
with her?

01:24:27.471 --> 01:24:28.502
<i>You know, if I lived
on a lake like this,</i>

01:24:28.504 --> 01:24:30.140
<i>I might never write again.</i>

01:24:38.514 --> 01:24:39.683
Nina.

01:24:43.988 --> 01:24:45.488
Nina, don't cry.

01:24:51.728 --> 01:24:52.863
<i>Ah!</i>

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.370
So,

01:25:00.904 --> 01:25:02.772
you're a real writer now.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:06.310
And I'm an actress.

01:25:08.512 --> 01:25:10.381
We both jumped into the fire.

01:25:11.749 --> 01:25:14.383
I dreamed of glory,
and now look at me.

01:25:15.519 --> 01:25:17.721
First thing tomorrow,
I'm off to Yelets.

01:25:19.123 --> 01:25:21.523
Booked there for
the winter season.

01:25:21.525 --> 01:25:24.361
Traveling third-class
with the peasants.

01:25:25.696 --> 01:25:27.498
Why wouldn't you ever see me?

01:25:32.202 --> 01:25:33.837
I thought you hated me.

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:36.340
I did.

01:25:37.573 --> 01:25:38.776
Hate you.

01:25:40.576 --> 01:25:42.046
I cursed you.

01:25:44.515 --> 01:25:47.883
If you had any idea of what
my life has been like...

01:25:47.885 --> 01:25:49.019
I do.

01:25:50.487 --> 01:25:52.389
And none of that
matters to me.

01:25:54.624 --> 01:25:57.528
I don't have the power
to stop loving you.

01:25:58.962 --> 01:26:00.364
Even now...

01:26:01.398 --> 01:26:03.000
Now I've had success.

01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:07.538
Without you,
my life has been...

01:26:12.076 --> 01:26:13.110
Please.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.779
Stay here with me.

01:26:17.246 --> 01:26:20.848
- Or let me come with you.
- No.

01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:23.787
- Nina, what's wrong?
- You shouldn't still love me.

01:26:26.623 --> 01:26:28.022
I should be killed.

01:26:28.024 --> 01:26:29.592
Don't say that.

01:26:31.594 --> 01:26:33.297
I'm so tired.

01:26:37.601 --> 01:26:39.169
I need a rest.

01:26:43.606 --> 01:26:45.108
I'm the seagull.

01:26:48.345 --> 01:26:50.613
No, I'm an actress.

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:53.747
Nina...

01:26:57.354 --> 01:26:59.055
You know, he laughed at me.

01:27:01.225 --> 01:27:02.992
He made fun of my acting.

01:27:05.795 --> 01:27:08.065
When I started onstage, I...

01:27:09.799 --> 01:27:13.170
God, I didn't... I didn't know
what to do with my hands.

01:27:14.637 --> 01:27:16.137
I didn't know where to stand.

01:27:16.139 --> 01:27:19.673
I couldn't...
I couldn't control my voice.

01:27:19.675 --> 01:27:22.477
You have no idea
how it feels to be onstage

01:27:22.479 --> 01:27:24.179
and know how badly
you're acting.

01:27:24.181 --> 01:27:25.413
You're a wonderful actress.

01:27:25.415 --> 01:27:27.449
No, I'm the seagull.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:30.684
I'm the seagull.
I'm the seagull!

01:27:30.686 --> 01:27:33.622
- No.
- Nina. Nina...

01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:35.692
No, it's not me.
That's not me.

01:27:37.628 --> 01:27:40.462
I've been walking
and walking and thinking,

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:44.533
and I know now that, for us,

01:27:44.535 --> 01:27:49.803
what counts isn't dreaming
about fame and glory,

01:27:49.805 --> 01:27:51.642
but it's about endurance.

01:27:53.676 --> 01:27:56.879
It's about knowing how to keep
going in spite of everything.

01:28:02.619 --> 01:28:06.290
Having faith in myself,
that's helped.

01:28:10.093 --> 01:28:11.495
But what if

01:28:13.297 --> 01:28:15.666
I have no faith in myself

01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:21.904
or any clue where I'm going
or what I'm doing?

01:28:27.743 --> 01:28:28.911
I have to go.

01:28:31.981 --> 01:28:34.182
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:36.184
- Well, then stay here, please, Nina.
- No.

01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:37.885
Nina, please, stay here.

01:28:37.887 --> 01:28:39.720
- Stop asking me. I can't! I can't.
- Nina, please.

01:28:39.722 --> 01:28:40.821
- I can't.
- Why?

01:28:40.823 --> 01:28:42.225
Because I love him!

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.168
Because I still love him.

01:28:53.869 --> 01:28:55.938
I love him more than before.

01:29:24.301 --> 01:29:25.901
I have to go.

01:29:57.933 --> 01:30:00.169
Remember how good
it was before?

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.841
Everything was so simple
and clear.

01:30:11.947 --> 01:30:13.015
Humans.

01:30:13.948 --> 01:30:15.916
Lions.

01:30:15.918 --> 01:30:18.819
- Eagles and partridges.
- Eagles and partridges.

01:30:18.821 --> 01:30:20.387
- Horned deer.
- Deer.

01:30:20.389 --> 01:30:22.091
Horned deer.

01:30:23.225 --> 01:30:24.327
Yes.

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.018
Don't give me that look.

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:27.856
No, no, no.

01:31:27.858 --> 01:31:31.058
You'll be scared, too,
when it's your turn.

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.727
The only people
who can fear death rationally

01:31:33.729 --> 01:31:35.729
are those who believe
in life hereafter,

01:31:35.731 --> 01:31:38.265
because they fear retribution
for their sins.

01:31:38.267 --> 01:31:40.234
But you...

01:31:40.236 --> 01:31:42.504
First, you don't believe.

01:31:42.506 --> 01:31:45.439
And secondly, what sins?

01:31:45.441 --> 01:31:47.508
You haven't done anything,

01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:50.377
except spend 25 years
in the Department of Justice.

01:31:50.379 --> 01:31:51.780
Twenty-eight.

01:31:59.054 --> 01:32:00.922
All right,
I have to hand the cards out.

01:32:07.763 --> 01:32:09.131
Sixteen.

01:32:10.932 --> 01:32:12.166
Great.

01:32:12.168 --> 01:32:14.234
Thirteen.

01:32:14.236 --> 01:32:16.336
- Six.
- Thank you.

01:32:16.338 --> 01:32:17.671
- I won.
- You won?

01:32:17.673 --> 01:32:18.739
Yep.

01:32:26.248 --> 01:32:27.947
- Thirty-seven.
- Don't go so fast.

01:32:27.949 --> 01:32:29.483
Oh, Papa.

01:32:29.485 --> 01:32:31.117
- Forty-five.
- Aw!

01:32:31.119 --> 01:32:32.921
- Forty-five?
- Finally, some luck.

01:32:32.923 --> 01:32:35.422
- This game is rigged.
- Ooh, going around again. Thirty-three.

01:32:35.424 --> 01:32:37.159
- Lotto!
- Hold on.

01:32:37.959 --> 01:32:39.094
Thirty.

01:32:41.062 --> 01:32:42.362
- Eighty-one.
- Eighty-one.

01:32:42.364 --> 01:32:43.365
Twenty-two.

01:32:45.634 --> 01:32:47.134
Sixty.

01:32:47.136 --> 01:32:49.736
Ah. This one
will be mine, sir.

01:32:49.738 --> 01:32:52.104
We'll see about that.

01:32:52.106 --> 01:32:53.774
Let's have another round,
shall we?

01:32:53.776 --> 01:32:54.777
Yes.

01:32:56.947 --> 01:32:58.279
Thank you. Thank you.

01:33:05.153 --> 01:33:08.387
Probably a little
explosion in my medical bag.

01:33:08.389 --> 01:33:11.425
Nothing to worry about.
Happens all the time.

01:33:11.427 --> 01:33:12.761
I'll go see.

01:33:23.137 --> 01:33:24.338
Just as I thought.

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.974
A small bottle of
ether exploded.

01:33:26.976 --> 01:33:29.242
- Oh, for...
- My apologies.

01:33:29.244 --> 01:33:31.010
Everything went black
for a moment.

01:33:31.012 --> 01:33:32.779
I thought...

01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:34.781
Sit down.
I'll get the drinks.

01:33:34.783 --> 01:33:37.049
Boris, can you help me?

01:33:37.051 --> 01:33:40.286
I just...
I wanted to ask you,

01:33:40.288 --> 01:33:42.789
there's an article
in this magazine

01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:45.060
that I'm curious to
get your opinion.

01:33:49.698 --> 01:33:53.667
<i>All lives, all lives</i>

01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:55.337
<i>all lives,</i>

01:33:57.806 --> 01:34:01.675
<i>having accomplished
their doleful circle,</i>

01:34:01.677 --> 01:34:03.077
<i>have died out.</i>

01:34:04.212 --> 01:34:06.046
Fourteen.

01:34:06.048 --> 01:34:09.116
<i>Already, thousands
of centuries have passed</i>

01:34:09.118 --> 01:34:13.820
<i>since the Earth
has borne one living creature.</i>

01:34:13.822 --> 01:34:19.093
<i>And in vain, the poor
moon shines her light.</i>
