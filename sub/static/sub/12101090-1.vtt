01:09.814 --> 01:11.950
Yellow One to base.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.586
Go ahead yellow one.

01:13.618 --> 01:16.121
Nothing but clear
skies.

01:16.154 --> 01:17.957
Are you certain about the
target?

01:17.990 --> 01:19.792
That is a roger yellow
one.

01:19.825 --> 01:21.293
The intel is sound.

01:21.326 --> 01:22.794
I just don't want this
to be

01:22.828 --> 01:24.763
another mission whitefish.

01:24.796 --> 01:27.633
Trust me, yellow
one, neither do I.

01:31.070 --> 01:32.872
Yellow one to base.

01:32.904 --> 01:34.239
Go ahead, Yellow one.

01:34.272 --> 01:36.075
Can you please verify
the size

01:36.108 --> 01:37.776
of what we are looking for?

01:37.809 --> 01:38.578
Sure.

01:38.611 --> 01:40.579
Early reports are that the
subject

01:40.612 --> 01:42.948
is over 50 meters in height.

01:42.981 --> 01:44.150
Wow.

01:44.183 --> 01:45.618
That big, huh?

01:45.650 --> 01:50.656
Yup, that big.

01:52.156 --> 01:54.960
You know, I
should be fishing now.

01:54.993 --> 01:56.294
Is that right?

01:56.328 --> 01:57.528
Yep.

01:57.562 --> 02:01.166
I was just about to head out
with my son when I got the call

02:01.200 --> 02:03.668
and I played the good soldier.

02:03.701 --> 02:05.870
You played the good
soldier.

02:05.903 --> 02:07.872
This is getting
pretty ridiculous.

02:07.906 --> 02:11.276
Remember this is
for the good of the nation.

02:11.309 --> 02:12.978
Sure, not so much for
the good

02:13.012 --> 02:14.113
of my marriage though.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.181
I hear ya.

02:16.214 --> 02:18.350
You do realize that I'm in this
with you?

02:18.383 --> 02:20.587
Well, there is
certainly that.

02:21.254 --> 02:23.189
So how much longer do we keep at
this?

02:23.221 --> 02:25.123
I'm told until
we locate the target.

02:25.156 --> 02:28.261
Great, how the heck
are we not seeing this thing?

02:31.964 --> 02:34.233
Yellow One, Yellow
One, get the hell out of...

02:34.266 --> 02:39.272
Oh my God, no.

05:34.111 --> 05:39.118
Okay, one more answer, Y-E-S.

05:40.853 --> 05:42.889
Let's see what type of vegetable
you are.

05:47.993 --> 05:49.362
Sweet potato.

05:51.596 --> 05:53.265
Let's try that again.

05:58.303 --> 05:59.971
You have an email.

06:08.180 --> 06:10.583
No, no, no, no, this can't be
right.

06:14.486 --> 06:19.224
Oh geez, where's the magnet.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.569
Ah, there you are.

06:45.950 --> 06:50.155
Okay, calculating
trajectory, times velocity.

07:02.634 --> 07:03.502
Oh darn.

07:07.339 --> 07:10.108
Dave, are you sure these
numbers

07:10.142 --> 07:12.310
you sent me, they're legit?

07:12.344 --> 07:14.279
I punched the numbers in twice

07:14.312 --> 07:17.048
and it is what it is.

07:17.082 --> 07:19.183
I think you need to make
the call.

07:19.216 --> 07:22.387
Yeah, it's time to wake up the
general.

07:22.421 --> 07:24.555
I don't envy you.

07:24.589 --> 07:25.524
Wish me luck.

07:31.195 --> 07:32.231
I'm going to need it.

07:41.238 --> 07:45.277
Sure, it is a gun in my
pocket.

07:46.445 --> 07:50.315
No, I'm not happy to see you.

08:00.524 --> 08:02.127
This better be important.

08:06.565 --> 08:10.101
Whoa, whoa, slow down there,
soldier.

08:10.135 --> 08:12.004
You don't just call me in
the middle of the night

08:12.036 --> 08:15.740
and wake me up with poppycock.

08:15.774 --> 08:18.644
Poppycock?

08:18.676 --> 08:22.614
Well, it's like a bunch
of whoey or nonsense.

08:24.216 --> 08:26.986
What, you never heard of the
word?

08:27.019 --> 08:28.252
What the heck are they teaching
you

08:28.286 --> 08:30.622
in basic training these days?

08:30.654 --> 08:32.157
Ridiculous.

08:34.525 --> 08:35.460
Are you sure?

08:37.761 --> 08:39.164
And you checked the math?

08:41.299 --> 08:44.370
So, aliens.

08:46.103 --> 08:50.209
Have we calculated the
trajectory to a landing site?

08:51.243 --> 08:53.012
Sorry, what?

08:53.045 --> 08:54.313
Crash site then?

08:55.647 --> 08:58.217
No, that's not good.

08:58.249 --> 09:00.118
We're going to need a tracker.

09:00.151 --> 09:04.156
We're going to need someone
good, no someone great.

09:04.189 --> 09:06.492
We're going to need the best of
the best,

09:06.525 --> 09:10.363
spare no expense, if you catch
my drift.

09:12.531 --> 09:16.101
That's right, you know what I'm
thinking.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.769
Get him on this right away.

09:19.738 --> 09:23.175
Time to bring out the big guns.

09:24.408 --> 09:27.445
Martha, get my pants.

10:17.863 --> 10:19.531
Be very careful.

10:19.564 --> 10:23.368
This place could be quite
dangerous.

10:31.843 --> 10:35.680
Skipper, Skipper it's
me, your best friend.

10:35.714 --> 10:37.550
Your most trusted ally.

10:39.251 --> 10:41.754
Slother, red fez?

10:43.821 --> 10:46.825
The General ask for you
to meet us in the jungle.

10:46.858 --> 10:49.728
There's an unidentified
flying object phenomenon

10:49.761 --> 10:50.863
you must check out.

10:50.896 --> 10:52.498
I'll send you the coordinates.

10:53.464 --> 10:55.233
Coordinates, GPS coordinates.

10:56.868 --> 10:59.104
I'll text you the address,
goodbye.

11:06.945 --> 11:09.448
My source tells me that
a local tribe in Amazon

11:09.480 --> 11:12.250
has retrieved the power source
from the fallen space craft.

11:16.253 --> 11:18.257
It's a disk shaped item
that they have taken,

11:18.290 --> 11:19.724
called the Gozongas.

11:23.494 --> 11:26.164
It's our job to track
it down and retrieve it.

11:43.315 --> 11:46.218
This map doesn't exactly
show us where the Amazons are,

11:46.917 --> 11:48.387
this is going to take all day.

11:49.121 --> 11:52.558
Stay sharp, we may be
dealing with a Savage bunch.

11:58.296 --> 11:59.730
That doesn't sound too savage.

11:59.763 --> 12:02.233
You'll never catch it, you
know?

12:02.267 --> 12:03.536
I bet you, I can if I tickle
you.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.323
It's the call.

12:24.355 --> 12:25.523
We must return to the village.

12:25.556 --> 12:26.557
Snuggles after?

12:26.590 --> 12:28.259
With her or me?

12:28.292 --> 12:30.296
- All three.
- All three

12:35.834 --> 12:38.770
Let's let's follow these
three.

12:38.802 --> 12:41.373
Amazing how you just thought
of that.

12:42.373 --> 12:44.542
I don't see any better idea.

12:44.575 --> 12:47.912
Besides, they're clearly
the tribe we're looking for.

12:47.945 --> 12:50.782
Marianne, Marianne, Marianne?

12:52.783 --> 12:54.785
Interloafers.

12:54.819 --> 12:55.920
Let's kill them.

12:55.954 --> 12:58.857
Let's take them to the queen,
she'll know what to do.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.608
Bring out the prisoners.

13:18.843 --> 13:20.779
We obey, mighty queen.

13:22.479 --> 13:23.615
Remove the blindfolds.

13:28.953 --> 13:31.257
Check out the gozongas.

13:32.022 --> 13:32.891
Really?

13:34.025 --> 13:36.560
The amulet around her neck,

13:36.594 --> 13:37.930
it must be the Gozongas.

13:39.430 --> 13:40.931
Are you sure of that?

13:40.964 --> 13:44.402
When it comes to I know to
look for.

13:45.969 --> 13:48.040
Are we still talking about the
amulet?

13:49.541 --> 13:51.676
Yeah, sure.

13:54.045 --> 13:58.083
You two are charged with
trespassing on sacred land.

13:58.116 --> 14:00.786
For centuries we have
lived here peacefully.

14:00.819 --> 14:02.688
Your presence here has
disrupted the natural order

14:02.720 --> 14:03.655
of our people.

14:04.455 --> 14:06.624
What do you have to say for
yourselves?

14:07.459 --> 14:12.631
My dear, I, how should we
address you?

14:12.664 --> 14:15.734
For generations, too many to
count,

14:15.767 --> 14:19.470
the tribal chieftesses have
been bestowed with the name,

14:19.503 --> 14:22.907
a name that instills
power, a name that chills

14:22.940 --> 14:25.076
the hearts of those who utter
it.

14:25.109 --> 14:27.912
The name of my mother and her
mother

14:27.945 --> 14:29.315
and grandmothers before,

14:30.081 --> 14:33.551
a name that you should be
honored to address me as.

14:33.584 --> 14:37.723
That name, that name is Peggy.

14:41.626 --> 14:46.632
Oh, well Peggy we're
but poor weary travelers.

14:49.066 --> 14:50.469
We mean no harm.

14:51.203 --> 14:53.905
If you would, but give us food
and shelter for the night,

14:53.938 --> 14:55.374
we'll be on our merry way.

14:57.541 --> 15:00.612
Spend the night on the ground?

15:00.645 --> 15:01.513
Shut up.

15:02.379 --> 15:06.517
Very well, you will be
our guests for the evening,

15:06.550 --> 15:07.953
but you shall leave tomorrow.

15:09.119 --> 15:10.755
Thank you.

15:10.789 --> 15:11.957
Now, if you don't mind

15:24.969 --> 15:26.438
I have a plan.

15:26.470 --> 15:27.671
What is it?

15:27.704 --> 15:30.809
I need you leave so I
can be alone with Peggy.

15:30.842 --> 15:31.843
I bet.

15:31.877 --> 15:33.612
I just need to be alone
with her long enough

15:33.645 --> 15:35.714
so I can get my hands on my
Gozongas.

15:35.747 --> 15:37.549
I know what you mean.

15:37.581 --> 15:39.049
Just do it.

15:39.083 --> 15:39.952
Fine.

15:41.453 --> 15:45.123
Can you please excuse
me for just a second.

15:45.156 --> 15:46.992
Stay within the camp
boundaries.

15:47.025 --> 15:48.961
Otherwise it will not be good
for you.

15:50.762 --> 15:51.630
Okay.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.835
I trust you are enjoying
yourself.

15:57.868 --> 15:59.404
I am now.

16:00.504 --> 16:01.605
How so?

16:01.640 --> 16:05.043
I never thanked you personally
for sparing our lives.

16:05.075 --> 16:06.478
We do have rules.

16:06.511 --> 16:08.880
However, we are civilized.

16:08.912 --> 16:10.047
We do have compassion.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.651
And I like that kind of
compassion.

16:13.852 --> 16:17.155
That's good, I think we
may be too close to the fire.

16:17.188 --> 16:19.191
I think the temperature is
just right.

16:20.992 --> 16:22.794
I may not be from your world,

16:22.826 --> 16:25.729
but I still know what's
considered appropriate.

16:25.762 --> 16:27.232
Do you, do you really?

16:27.265 --> 16:31.003
The world changes, things
change, people change.

16:32.002 --> 16:32.871
Come with me.

16:34.506 --> 16:35.607
I don't think I can.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.742
Sure, you can.

16:41.278 --> 16:42.213
This is so exciting.

16:42.247 --> 16:45.116
I've never done anything like
this before.

16:45.148 --> 16:47.952
Of course, any man have visited
the Island

16:47.985 --> 16:52.990
have died moments after landing,
nonetheless, never before.

16:53.757 --> 16:57.728
Right, right, but if we're
going to do this properly,

16:57.762 --> 17:00.998
we need to take care
of a few things first.

17:01.031 --> 17:01.900
Such as?

17:02.666 --> 17:06.569
Such as remove anything
cumbersome like this watch.

17:06.603 --> 17:10.107
This watch is, is this watch is
just

17:10.141 --> 17:12.109
going to get in the way.

17:12.142 --> 17:13.777
Of what?

17:13.810 --> 17:15.981
The stuff, you know, the
stuff.

17:19.550 --> 17:20.219
Oh.

17:22.853 --> 17:27.726
Take this amulet or whatever
it is.

17:27.758 --> 17:29.627
It is so going to get in the
way.

17:30.795 --> 17:33.265
Okay, I'll just take this off

17:33.297 --> 17:35.700
and I'll put it right down
there.

17:36.535 --> 17:40.238
Peggy, I have something to
show you.

17:41.139 --> 17:41.973
You do?

17:42.006 --> 17:43.575
I do.

17:43.607 --> 17:44.742
Show me.

17:44.776 --> 17:46.010
What's that over there?

17:48.112 --> 17:49.581
Zoink.

17:49.613 --> 17:51.283
Zoink, zoink, zoink?

18:01.692 --> 18:02.560
Let's go.

18:02.594 --> 18:03.728
Yeah, I almost got this.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.595
What, are you crazy?

18:04.629 --> 18:05.564
I've got the Gozongas.

18:05.596 --> 18:06.730
Oh yeah, right, okay.

18:06.764 --> 18:08.132
Oh, wait, wait.

18:08.165 --> 18:09.133
What?

18:09.167 --> 18:10.334
I called in a favor.

18:10.367 --> 18:11.135
There's a plane waiting for
us at the end of the Island.

18:11.169 --> 18:12.036
Great.

18:32.824 --> 18:34.092
Catch that plane.

18:34.124 --> 18:36.060
The plane, the plane.

18:38.863 --> 18:40.932
Hurry, catch the plane.

18:51.075 --> 18:52.678
But I loved him.

19:00.117 --> 19:03.654
Skipper, you need to
deliver the alien gozongas

19:03.688 --> 19:06.157
to Professor Mills right away.

19:06.190 --> 19:08.759
He has to start research
testing.

19:23.106 --> 19:24.274
Good evening.

19:24.307 --> 19:28.145
Clinical trial KTNT, part one.

19:29.247 --> 19:31.416
Please excuse my surroundings.

19:31.449 --> 19:35.219
Recent events have
separated me from my lab.

19:36.054 --> 19:39.257
I'm attempting to splice
DNA with the substance,

19:39.289 --> 19:43.260
along with this common
houseplant.

19:43.294 --> 19:46.163
I believe that once
unleashed to the elements,

19:46.197 --> 19:50.202
the substance will require a
biological host to survive.

19:50.869 --> 19:55.040
Containment has been
difficult and I'm afraid

19:55.073 --> 19:57.374
that unless I can control this,

19:57.408 --> 20:00.011
future tests will be impossible,

20:00.044 --> 20:05.050
as the KTNT may become unstable
resulting in God knows what.

20:12.090 --> 20:13.125
Here we go.

20:20.832 --> 20:22.200
I should have worn a watch.

20:28.238 --> 20:30.874
Well, early results are
favorable.

20:30.908 --> 20:33.945
The host seems to be accepting
the splice.

20:39.382 --> 20:41.152
That's not a good sound.

20:44.287 --> 20:45.856
Excuse me a moment.

20:55.533 --> 21:00.405
Oh, it looks like the test
subject did not work well.

21:01.506 --> 21:04.242
Perhaps a different specimen is
needed.

21:13.183 --> 21:14.885
Good evening.

21:14.919 --> 21:19.457
Clinical trial, KTNT part two.

21:19.489 --> 21:23.260
The substance seems slightly
unstable.

21:23.294 --> 21:27.865
The elemental breakdown has
resulted in a few surprises,

21:27.899 --> 21:32.170
namely, that there are elements
that require classification,

21:32.202 --> 21:36.074
new elements, foreign elements.

21:36.106 --> 21:39.943
This will require more
testing at some point.

21:39.977 --> 21:44.882
There does seem to be an
organic nature to the substance.

21:44.915 --> 21:48.919
I believe that this will
have the ability to splice

21:48.952 --> 21:51.322
with an organic of this earth.

21:52.023 --> 21:57.262
Previous testing had resulted
in immediate decomposition.

21:57.295 --> 22:00.230
The basic genetic makeup
of the host plant,

22:00.264 --> 22:04.936
unfortunately resulted in
an unstable environment.

22:04.969 --> 22:09.841
I have since decided to
conduct tests on live animals.

22:10.540 --> 22:15.546
I have acquired a primate to
conduct the DNA splicing with.

22:16.113 --> 22:21.018
The specimen seems healthy
and of good nature,

22:21.052 --> 22:24.522
aside from a rather dreadful
incident

22:24.555 --> 22:27.225
regarding some oatmeal this
morning.

22:27.257 --> 22:30.161
I have full confidence that the
experiment

22:30.193 --> 22:32.163
will be successful.

22:33.930 --> 22:40.438
I've modified the delivery
method of the KTNT to pill form.

22:40.470 --> 22:43.974
Injection, I believe will
result in too intense

22:44.007 --> 22:46.478
an experience for the specimen.

22:55.486 --> 22:56.555
All right, here we go.

23:02.325 --> 23:04.328
Behave, behave yourself.

23:15.072 --> 23:19.411
Well, the dose has been
administered.

23:22.345 --> 23:23.381
Now we wait.

23:26.950 --> 23:27.618
Indeed.

23:33.924 --> 23:35.626
The name of the dog in the
Brady Bunch?

23:35.660 --> 23:37.461
Tiger, you already asked me
that.

23:41.198 --> 23:42.234
Tranquilizer.

23:49.039 --> 23:54.045
Upon first observation, the
subject seems in good spirits.

23:57.715 --> 24:00.952
There does not seem to be any

24:00.985 --> 24:04.055
adverse effect at all, actually.

24:06.324 --> 24:11.129
Well, that is certainly
surprising.

24:12.028 --> 24:13.931
I'm not sure what's happening
with the test subject,

24:13.965 --> 24:17.468
but with further tests I
believe that we can isolate

24:17.500 --> 24:21.972
the anomaly and get some
concrete results here.

24:22.006 --> 24:23.207
No.

24:23.239 --> 24:28.179
Wait, Susan, are you okay,
Susan?

24:31.382 --> 24:32.316
They found me.

24:33.985 --> 24:38.657
I need to turn this off,
but first there you go.

24:42.426 --> 24:45.630
Your chains are off, run, hide.

24:45.662 --> 24:47.297
They cannot find you.

24:47.331 --> 24:48.934
Do you understand?

24:50.034 --> 24:54.005
You do understand, incredible.

24:54.037 --> 24:56.473
You better go now, hide.

24:59.376 --> 25:02.546
Now to destroy the evidence.

25:07.751 --> 25:09.619
The target is
terminated.

25:09.652 --> 25:12.556
No sir, no one alive, sir.

25:12.590 --> 25:15.159
It looks like there was an
animal that was changed here,

25:15.191 --> 25:17.394
but no sign of it.

25:17.428 --> 25:19.063
Understood, sir.

25:19.095 --> 25:20.998
There is a camera we will
collect

25:21.032 --> 25:23.101
as evidence and burn all traces.

25:23.133 --> 25:24.169
Understood, sir.

25:32.276 --> 25:36.080
Do you think mama
would let us have a pet?

25:36.113 --> 25:36.981
No.

25:37.915 --> 25:39.649
Well, if we could
have a pet,

25:39.682 --> 25:41.518
what would you have?

25:41.552 --> 25:46.558
A snake, a tarentula,
a dog, a cat, a hamster.

25:52.830 --> 25:54.399
Do you think she'll
ever

25:54.431 --> 25:55.599
let us have one someday?

25:56.267 --> 25:59.004
I don't think so.

26:01.238 --> 26:03.374
Well I hope so.

28:41.632 --> 28:42.799
Major Ryan.

28:45.768 --> 28:47.238
It's time?

28:47.270 --> 28:47.938
Yes, sir.

29:46.729 --> 29:47.731
Of course.

30:03.913 --> 30:06.283
Okay, here we go.

30:11.654 --> 30:12.690
Darn it.

30:28.604 --> 30:29.440
What?

30:34.577 --> 30:37.681
Sorry, having a bad morning.

30:38.815 --> 30:41.451
What, when?

30:42.518 --> 30:45.957
You're certain, it was the work
of foreign military agents?

30:47.623 --> 30:51.028
They took all the alien items,
everything?

30:51.929 --> 30:54.031
What about the specimen?

30:54.064 --> 30:56.967
I know there was going to
be a live test subject.

30:56.999 --> 30:59.869
My twin brother updated
me on the progress.

30:59.902 --> 31:03.373
Speaking of which, can you
please put him on the line?

31:05.109 --> 31:06.511
Are you certain?

31:07.710 --> 31:10.914
Shot dead in the back?

31:12.850 --> 31:17.855
I see, he was always the
handsome one.

31:19.890 --> 31:22.627
No, I understand.

31:23.794 --> 31:24.661
No.

31:26.095 --> 31:28.732
Yes, we need to regroup.

31:30.033 --> 31:33.838
The test subject, is it
still at the compound

31:33.871 --> 31:36.873
or did they make off with that
too?

31:38.609 --> 31:40.411
So it escaped.

31:40.443 --> 31:41.978
We need to find it.

31:42.011 --> 31:44.781
If we don't all is lost.

31:44.815 --> 31:47.485
This takes priority over
everything else.

31:47.517 --> 31:49.719
If we have a chance of
making things, right,

31:49.753 --> 31:51.655
we have to get going.

31:51.688 --> 31:53.091
Find that monkey.

32:33.997 --> 32:36.401
This is awesome.

32:46.176 --> 32:49.680
Hey Grayson, how long can
you hold yourself up for?

32:49.712 --> 32:50.546
What's the record?

32:50.581 --> 32:52.683
There isn't one yet, you go
first.

32:52.716 --> 32:53.584
Okay.

32:54.718 --> 32:56.053
Go Grayson, go.

33:03.759 --> 33:05.094
Did you hear that?

33:05.128 --> 33:05.963
Hear what?

33:05.996 --> 33:07.465
Over there.

33:07.498 --> 33:08.565
In the playhouse?

33:12.936 --> 33:14.138
Now it's over there.

33:14.171 --> 33:15.672
Under that plant?

33:15.706 --> 33:16.574
Under where?

33:17.574 --> 33:19.177
You said underwear.

33:20.276 --> 33:23.046
Oh, it's just a chipmunk.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.482
Chipmunk, ah.

33:52.910 --> 33:54.577
Enough is enough.

33:54.611 --> 33:56.514
I need to find that monkey.

33:57.680 --> 34:00.950
Operator, all hands on deck.

34:00.984 --> 34:03.988
Let's get every available
resource on this.

34:05.889 --> 34:08.659
You heard me, everyone.

34:09.625 --> 34:12.129
Well sure, why not?

34:12.161 --> 34:14.098
Yeah, even him.

34:14.130 --> 34:18.268
In fact, put me through to
Major Bummer, right now.

34:24.206 --> 34:25.076
Hello?

34:25.810 --> 34:29.712
Major Bummer, wake up.
Soldier.

34:29.745 --> 34:33.750
It's pronounced Bummier, but
I'm up.

34:33.783 --> 34:36.985
Did I ask for an opinion,
soldier.

34:37.020 --> 34:39.123
Oh, ex soldiers, sir.

34:39.790 --> 34:43.761
Yeah, I know, honorably
discharged.

34:43.793 --> 34:46.897
Sure, but you know what soldier?

34:46.929 --> 34:50.902
Your country needs you
and we need you now.

34:52.668 --> 34:57.241
No, no, I understand like
today now?

34:58.774 --> 35:02.078
I wouldn't know any
other now other than today.

35:04.047 --> 35:06.016
You know what I mean?

35:06.049 --> 35:08.252
Look, clean yourself up.

35:08.285 --> 35:11.120
I'll send you the mission
information to print out

35:11.154 --> 35:12.890
and now get going.

35:14.625 --> 35:16.360
Oh yes sir, yes, sir.

35:16.393 --> 35:19.030
That's the spirit, go get him.

35:26.837 --> 35:27.705
Bummer.

36:04.908 --> 36:08.779
Now boys, chipmunks
are more afraid of you

36:08.812 --> 36:09.947
than you are of them.

36:11.348 --> 36:13.083
You mean like you and spiders,
mom?

36:13.116 --> 36:15.886
No, no, spiders are different.

36:15.919 --> 36:19.656
They have eight legs and a
million eyes.

36:21.825 --> 36:26.864
I got to go in and make
supper, play nice, okay?

36:26.897 --> 36:29.165
Here's a snack for when
you guys get hungry.

36:30.132 --> 36:31.701
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:31.734 --> 36:32.636
Okay, have fun.

36:57.993 --> 36:59.296
What was that noise?

36:59.328 --> 37:01.031
Hope it's not a squirrel
again.

37:01.732 --> 37:04.067
It's come over from
there, wanna sneak in?

37:12.142 --> 37:14.410
What, you ate all our snacks?

37:14.444 --> 37:17.281
I was playing with you,
how could I eat them?

37:17.314 --> 37:19.183
Let's have a look in the
playhouse.

37:21.884 --> 37:23.053
It's a baby gorilla.

37:23.085 --> 37:24.087
Could we keep him?

37:24.855 --> 37:27.358
Sure, but I don't think
you should tell mom.

37:30.026 --> 37:32.328
What should we name him?

37:32.361 --> 37:33.229
Konga.

37:34.263 --> 37:35.198
Here boy.

37:58.788 --> 38:00.757
Let's see what all the fuss is
about.

38:05.161 --> 38:06.763
You have got to be kidding me.

38:11.234 --> 38:13.069
Well, let's get to it, soldier.

38:17.107 --> 38:17.975
Let's go.

38:23.513 --> 38:26.049
We can't have mommy find
Konga.

38:26.082 --> 38:27.116
Why not?

38:27.149 --> 38:31.120
Because we can't have a
cat until we're like 12.

38:31.154 --> 38:35.793
I assume we can't have a gorilla
until like we're hundred.

38:37.127 --> 38:38.027
Makes sense.

38:41.997 --> 38:44.033
Are you hungry, Konga?

38:44.067 --> 38:45.803
No, that's my stomach.

38:45.835 --> 38:47.504
I didn't get my snack today.

38:47.536 --> 38:49.239
Thanks, Konga.

38:49.272 --> 38:50.940
Is everything okay?

38:50.973 --> 38:52.809
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:52.843 --> 38:53.978
I'm coming in.

38:56.478 --> 38:58.348
Now what's going on in here?

38:58.381 --> 38:59.884
Nothing.

39:01.085 --> 39:05.155
Why are you answering me like
you're asking me a question?

39:05.187 --> 39:06.956
I don't know.

39:06.989 --> 39:09.892
Mom, what's the 10th degree?

39:09.926 --> 39:11.261
10th degree?

39:11.294 --> 39:13.397
Okay, what's going on over here?

39:15.198 --> 39:16.366
Why so suspicious?

39:17.933 --> 39:20.102
There's a saying among moms,

39:20.136 --> 39:23.172
when there's quiet, there's
trouble.

39:23.205 --> 39:26.175
We could be louder if you're
like.

39:26.209 --> 39:28.011
That's not what I meant.

39:28.044 --> 39:29.480
Nevermind, I'm out.

39:32.482 --> 39:34.017
Phew, that was a close one.

39:34.049 --> 39:35.352
Not so quiet.

39:35.384 --> 39:37.988
Oof, that was a close one.

39:39.221 --> 39:41.091
You boys getting along
up there?

39:41.123 --> 39:43.160
- Yes.
- Yes.

40:24.033 --> 40:25.067
Good afternoon, ma'am.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.502
How are you today?

40:26.535 --> 40:30.239
I'm fine, everything okay?

40:30.272 --> 40:32.008
Yes, yes, everything is fine.

40:32.042 --> 40:33.377
No need for alarm.

40:33.410 --> 40:37.281
I just wanted to know if
perhaps you have seen this ape.

40:37.314 --> 40:42.118
Ape, you're asking me if I've
seen a wild ape on the loose

40:42.152 --> 40:44.922
and not to worry, are you
kidding me?

40:45.589 --> 40:48.491
I'm sorry, I just
didn't want to worry you.

40:48.524 --> 40:50.293
Well, you did.

40:50.326 --> 40:52.930
And no, I have not seen any
apes, geez.

40:53.997 --> 40:55.031
Well, I wanted to...

40:55.064 --> 40:56.267
I can't believe this guy.

41:04.406 --> 41:05.542
That was a close one.

41:05.575 --> 41:06.475
Too close.

41:06.509 --> 41:07.978
Do know what this means?

41:08.011 --> 41:08.679
No.

41:08.712 --> 41:10.480
More time to play with Konga.

41:10.513 --> 41:11.348
Yay.

42:36.533 --> 42:39.201
Tell me you have some good
news.

42:39.234 --> 42:40.336
Nothing yet, sir.

42:40.370 --> 42:42.038
I just want to check in is all.

42:42.906 --> 42:47.544
Now, what kind of an idiot
would call with an update of,

42:47.576 --> 42:49.279
I have nothing?

42:49.312 --> 42:51.781
That's the call when I call you?

42:51.814 --> 42:54.050
Just thought you'd like to
know.

42:54.084 --> 42:56.719
That I'd like to know that
you didn't find anything?

42:58.087 --> 42:59.656
That's ridiculous.

43:00.522 --> 43:01.557
I understand, sir.

43:01.591 --> 43:03.426
It won't happen again.

43:03.460 --> 43:04.761
It better not.

43:04.794 --> 43:08.230
I want you to update me
every hour on the hour.

43:08.263 --> 43:09.799
You understand?

43:09.832 --> 43:13.202
But what if there's nothing,
sir?

43:13.870 --> 43:17.406
I told you not to call
me and report nothing.

43:17.439 --> 43:21.110
You soldier need to get your
ears checked.

43:22.178 --> 43:23.113
Understood, sir.

43:24.547 --> 43:27.451
Good, talk to you in an hour
then.

43:27.484 --> 43:30.687
Yes, sir, maybe sir.

43:33.122 --> 43:35.591
Yes, sir, maybe sir.

43:41.531 --> 43:43.534
I have one hour to find that
ape.

43:47.837 --> 43:49.706
Konga, what's wrong?

44:26.643 --> 44:28.645
Yeah, we're going to need more
backup.

44:31.314 --> 44:34.384
Only Danger Force can help us
now.

44:34.417 --> 44:36.886
Time to get the team back
together.

44:41.890 --> 44:42.858
And now
what's special news update

44:42.892 --> 44:45.828
with KBN reporter, Megan Bacon.

44:47.529 --> 44:50.399
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen,

44:50.433 --> 44:52.936
we will return to Who's Making
Cakes

44:52.968 --> 44:55.604
after this important bulletin.

44:55.638 --> 44:59.209
There have been unconfirmed
reports of a large creature

44:59.241 --> 45:01.343
roaming the streets of our city.

45:01.377 --> 45:03.714
Some have described as a large
Chimp.

45:04.381 --> 45:08.652
Others believe the monster to
be that of a monkey variety.

45:08.685 --> 45:11.555
Well, I'll tell you folks,

45:11.587 --> 45:13.923
this anchor does not
quite know the difference.

45:15.757 --> 45:16.727
What's this?

45:18.294 --> 45:19.696
Yes.

45:19.728 --> 45:21.564
I'm just getting this.

45:21.598 --> 45:23.567
We have some amateur footage
coming in.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.602
We will cut to this footage
immediately.

45:28.437 --> 45:31.840
Oh my, are you seeing this?

45:31.873 --> 45:36.379
I've never seen anything
like this ever, I swear it.

45:36.411 --> 45:37.881
This is monumental.

45:37.913 --> 45:41.218
This is, this is not a
special effects, folks.

45:41.250 --> 45:43.819
This is coming to you
straight from my camera phone.

45:51.493 --> 45:55.932
Well, I'm speechless folks.

45:58.533 --> 46:00.369
You've got to be kidding me.

46:04.373 --> 46:06.576
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,

46:06.609 --> 46:08.879
there must have been some
mistake here.

46:11.013 --> 46:15.518
We now bring you back to your
regular program, goodnight.

46:29.966 --> 46:31.268
Yeah, yeah, no I'm on it.

46:31.301 --> 46:31.968
I'm on it.

46:32.000 --> 46:32.935
Yeah, I can get it fixed.

46:32.968 --> 46:35.437
Yeah, it wouldn't be more than
five bucks.

46:35.471 --> 46:36.639
Give me a call back.

46:36.672 --> 46:38.375
Actually, I just heard noise
in back, think it's my dog.

46:38.408 --> 46:41.678
He's been missing, we
haven't found him for weeks.

46:41.710 --> 46:43.312
I think he's out in the barn,
I gotta go check it out.

46:43.346 --> 46:44.714
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

46:44.747 --> 46:45.949
All right, bye.

46:47.683 --> 46:49.952
Skippy, Skippy, morning boy.

46:51.386 --> 46:54.257
Skippy, Skippy, where are you
boy?

46:55.424 --> 46:56.292
Skippy.

46:58.627 --> 46:59.696
That's weird.

47:01.797 --> 47:03.600
Oh my God, oh my God.

47:11.341 --> 47:14.411
Whewy, that's one blue ribbon
kitten.

48:26.448 --> 48:28.784
I know he's out there
somewheres.

48:29.618 --> 48:31.921
I'm going to catch me a big foot
today.

48:33.756 --> 48:35.091
Hey, what's that?

48:42.631 --> 48:45.768
Whoa, he's even bigger than I
thought.

49:09.591 --> 49:10.759
Nobody at the Big Foot Society

49:10.792 --> 49:12.395
is ever going to believe this.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.439
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, I'm Megan Bacon.

49:22.471 --> 49:25.874
We will return you to
Where We Left Our Hairpiece

49:25.908 --> 49:29.446
after this important news
message.

49:29.478 --> 49:32.515
I believe that I may
have acted rather hastily

49:32.547 --> 49:34.850
earlier this evening when we
reported

49:34.884 --> 49:37.821
a large ape-like creature on the
loose.

49:38.721 --> 49:40.156
After multiple reports,

49:40.189 --> 49:44.661
we can confirm that there
is indeed an enormous ape

49:44.694 --> 49:46.129
running through the city.

49:47.096 --> 49:49.098
What are its motives?

49:49.131 --> 49:50.667
What are its thoughts and
feelings?

49:50.700 --> 49:53.602
What is its favorite food?

49:53.636 --> 49:56.773
And if it is bananas,
will we now be forced

49:56.806 --> 49:59.576
to pay a premium for this
commodity going forward?

50:00.243 --> 50:04.581
Local authorities are
advising people to stay home.

50:04.614 --> 50:08.251
If you must leave your house,
please be on the lookout.

50:08.283 --> 50:09.852
If you come across this
creature,

50:09.886 --> 50:14.123
please do not feed or engage in
any way.

50:14.156 --> 50:17.960
The public is also asked that
if they do see the creature

50:17.993 --> 50:20.963
to call the local authorities
immediately.

50:20.997 --> 50:22.931
We thank you for your
cooperation,

50:22.964 --> 50:23.832
and we now bring you back

50:23.866 --> 50:26.636
to your regular scheduled
programming.

50:28.103 --> 50:31.475
Major Bummer, you're three
minutes late.

50:32.808 --> 50:35.678
Yes, sorry for being late,
sir.

50:35.710 --> 50:37.513
It's Bummier.

50:38.848 --> 50:39.950
Any word on the backup?

50:41.651 --> 50:44.020
The troops are on their way,
Bummer.

51:45.881 --> 51:47.250
A giant gorilla?

51:47.283 --> 51:48.919
I'll believe it when I see it.

52:23.919 --> 52:25.855
No, oh gross.

54:34.783 --> 54:35.451
Mama pajama.

54:43.292 --> 54:46.296
Whoa, that is one skyscraping
ape.

54:56.839 --> 54:58.306
Sir, I'm sending
coordinates to you right now.

54:58.339 --> 54:59.908
I'm tracking this movement.

54:59.942 --> 55:01.377
It's about time,
soldier.

55:01.410 --> 55:04.046
We don't have all day, you know.

55:04.078 --> 55:06.214
Yes, sir, you should
be getting it right now.

55:06.247 --> 55:08.183
Are you sure,
soldier?

55:08.216 --> 55:10.219
All our readings aren't
negative.

55:11.486 --> 55:13.021
Video confirmation.

55:13.055 --> 55:14.790
I don't see
anything.

55:17.225 --> 55:18.761
That's one big monkey.

55:20.428 --> 55:21.864
Oh, no, no, wait, wait.

55:44.285 --> 55:46.555
Whoa, that's funky monkey.

55:49.591 --> 55:52.828
Oh my God, it's so big, it's so
big.

55:53.562 --> 55:55.397
What's happening to this city?

55:55.431 --> 55:57.433
What is happening to our world?

55:57.466 --> 55:58.468
What is going on?

57:15.444 --> 57:18.514
No, there is no way
that I'm going to let

57:18.547 --> 57:21.351
some gorilla rampage this
commode,

57:22.283 --> 57:24.353
this amazing life that I have.

57:25.553 --> 57:26.521
Don't you agree?

57:27.957 --> 57:28.892
Yes you do.

58:02.223 --> 58:03.959
Are you sure this is going to
work?

58:03.993 --> 58:07.363
I'm sure, we want to
lure Konga to where we are.

58:08.364 --> 58:11.100
Are you sure he's going
to chase a giant hot dog?

58:11.132 --> 58:14.469
If I was a giant gorilla, I
would chase a giant hot dog.

58:15.536 --> 58:16.406
Let's go.

59:46.727 --> 59:48.730
We interrupt your
programming to bring you

59:48.763 --> 59:51.366
this important message.

59:51.399 --> 59:54.469
Millions have left the
city and millions more

59:54.502 --> 59:58.173
are on their way out under the
advisement

59:58.207 --> 01:00:01.310
of our mayor and local law
enforcement.

01:00:01.343 --> 01:00:04.513
There have been many
reports of mass destruction

01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:05.580
throughout the city.

01:00:05.614 --> 01:00:09.819
This creature is certainly
upset about something.

01:00:09.852 --> 01:00:12.087
Upon multiple attempts at
finding out

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.355
exactly what the creature is
upset about,

01:00:14.388 --> 01:00:16.858
we have learned two things.

01:00:16.892 --> 01:00:21.330
One, he does not just eat
bananas,

01:00:21.363 --> 01:00:23.665
but live on the scene reporters.

01:00:23.698 --> 01:00:28.436
And two, he has not bathed in
days.

01:00:28.469 --> 01:00:30.272
Those that are not able to leave
the city

01:00:30.305 --> 01:00:33.109
are advised to stay in their
basements, if possible.

01:00:33.142 --> 01:00:35.511
If you do not have a
basement, find a neighbor

01:00:35.544 --> 01:00:38.314
or find a cover under your
kitchen table.

01:00:38.346 --> 01:00:42.183
If you are in a high rise,
seek shelter at low levels,

01:00:42.216 --> 01:00:46.455
Above all, please stay safe.

01:00:47.256 --> 01:00:51.259
We now bring you back to your
regular scheduled programming,

01:00:52.928 --> 01:00:56.531
which is the news.

01:00:56.564 --> 01:00:57.866
Is that a thing?

01:01:14.216 --> 01:01:15.884
Konga, Konga, Konga.

01:01:18.386 --> 01:01:22.124
Konga, Konga, follow the giant
hot dog.

01:01:27.462 --> 01:01:29.297
Send in the air strike.

01:01:30.966 --> 01:01:32.768
Konga is moving
away from the city.

01:01:32.801 --> 01:01:34.770
Get me the general on
the horn.

01:01:34.803 --> 01:01:36.939
We need you at
sector five now, sir.

01:01:36.971 --> 01:01:41.709
Video confirmation, I
still don't see anything.

01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:42.945
Start digging that
trench

01:01:42.977 --> 01:01:45.446
and fill it with gasoline

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.150
I want to order a large pizza.

01:02:40.002 --> 01:02:41.871
- Konga.
- Konga, stop.

01:02:45.473 --> 01:02:47.776
All right boys, close
in.

01:02:47.808 --> 01:02:49.511
It needs military power.

01:02:51.546 --> 01:02:53.815
Easy now, final ready.

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:56.352
Keep him in your sight.

01:03:00.888 --> 01:03:04.292
Fire, fire.

01:03:50.471 --> 01:03:51.473
Konga, no.

01:03:57.379 --> 01:03:59.982
This monkey can really take
it.

01:04:09.357 --> 01:04:10.959
Konga, we love you.

01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:22.438
Who still has a
visual?

01:04:22.471 --> 01:04:23.939
Negative, sir.

01:04:23.971 --> 01:04:24.973
Where'd he go?

01:04:25.006 --> 01:04:25.806
All right, everyone.

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:28.310
Stand down until we see him
again.

01:04:37.118 --> 01:04:39.854
Oh, he's a little cutey.

01:04:39.888 --> 01:04:41.556
Ain't that a cutey?

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:40.049
Yes, General.

01:05:42.616 --> 01:05:45.921
No, it looks like he got away.

01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:48.958
I have no idea where he went.

01:05:50.759 --> 01:05:51.627
It's a mystery.

01:05:55.797 --> 01:05:58.467
I don't care what the facts
are, Major.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.937
A thing of that size doesn't
just up and disappear.

01:06:03.638 --> 01:06:06.942
That is no way to talk to your
superior officer, soldier.

01:06:07.642 --> 01:06:09.745
Not while he's investigating the
death

01:06:09.777 --> 01:06:11.446
of his own twin brother.

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:17.553
So you've been honorably
discharged again?

01:06:19.053 --> 01:06:21.723
All right then, ex soldier.

01:06:23.558 --> 01:06:25.995
Well all the best to you too.

01:06:31.031 --> 01:06:33.734
I can't believe that guy,
trying to convince me

01:06:33.768 --> 01:06:37.506
that this massive ape just
disappeared.

01:06:38.739 --> 01:06:40.642
What kind of malarkey is that?

01:06:42.076 --> 01:06:45.848
Actually, I think I have an
explanation.

01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:49.718
Wait, what, how?

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.786
Great to see you too.

01:06:51.819 --> 01:06:53.754
Let me explain.

01:06:53.788 --> 01:06:55.491
So in my research recordings,

01:06:55.524 --> 01:06:59.261
I mentioned that the
KTNT was very unstable.

01:06:59.294 --> 01:07:03.198
When I applied it to a
plant, the plant fizzled out.

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:04.031
Okay?

01:07:04.064 --> 01:07:06.200
So instead of the ape fizzling
out,

01:07:06.234 --> 01:07:10.973
his genetic makeup eventually
rejected the foreign element.

01:07:11.006 --> 01:07:12.674
Once it left the host,

01:07:12.707 --> 01:07:15.844
the monkey reverted back
to his original size.

01:07:15.877 --> 01:07:18.647
Ah, next question.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.649
Well that is a story in and of
itself.

01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:23.518
Yes, I was shot.

01:07:23.551 --> 01:07:27.655
Yes, I was considered dead,
but here's the crazy thing.

01:07:27.689 --> 01:07:30.893
Not sure how I feel
about more crazy though.

01:07:30.926 --> 01:07:33.094
Well, since this craziness is
over with,

01:07:33.127 --> 01:07:34.729
I think you're good.

01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:36.297
Gotcha.

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:40.201
So after I was so rudely
shot in the back by terrorists,

01:07:40.234 --> 01:07:44.205
my body fell in the smallest
drop of KTNT.

01:07:44.239 --> 01:07:46.108
So it made you grow big?

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:49.844
Heck no, that's not
scientifically possible.

01:07:49.877 --> 01:07:51.312
I'm no ape.

01:07:51.346 --> 01:07:52.447
All right.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.183
What did happen was that
all my wounds were healed

01:07:55.216 --> 01:07:56.852
within a few days.

01:07:56.884 --> 01:07:58.120
Imagine that.

01:07:58.152 --> 01:07:59.721
I'm trying to.

01:07:59.754 --> 01:08:00.788
That's it.

01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:03.925
So was there any of the
KTNT left for analysis?

01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:07.161
Not a drop, a real shame
though.

01:08:07.194 --> 01:08:11.265
True, but it is nice
to have you back brother.

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:12.301
Jimbo.

01:08:12.334 --> 01:08:13.801
Timbo.

01:08:14.902 --> 01:08:18.238
Should probably sanitize
myself.

01:08:18.272 --> 01:08:19.307
You're right.

01:08:25.179 --> 01:08:26.814
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen,

01:08:26.848 --> 01:08:30.152
we interrupt your regularly
scheduled programming

01:08:30.184 --> 01:08:32.754
to bring you this important
message.

01:08:33.554 --> 01:08:38.760
As soon as everything started,
it has ended just as quickly.

01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:42.331
Law enforcements are just as
baffled as the general public.

01:08:42.363 --> 01:08:44.599
The creature has disappeared.

01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:48.170
I repeat, the creature has
disappeared.

01:08:48.202 --> 01:08:51.005
The city, and for that matter,
the world,

01:08:51.037 --> 01:08:54.175
is trying to figure out
exactly what happened.

01:08:54.209 --> 01:08:58.080
From here, all we can
do is look for answers.

01:08:58.112 --> 01:08:59.779
Answers for questions like

01:08:59.813 --> 01:09:02.750
what was the motive for the
rampage?

01:09:02.783 --> 01:09:04.620
Did it find what it was looking
for

01:09:04.653 --> 01:09:06.354
or accomplish what it wanted?

01:09:06.388 --> 01:09:09.256
If so, is that why it left?

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:10.725
Where did it go?

01:09:10.759 --> 01:09:14.328
And how did it leave without a
trace?

01:09:14.362 --> 01:09:16.064
We may never know.

01:09:16.095 --> 01:09:20.868
Hopefully we do not have to
go through this ever again.

01:09:20.902 --> 01:09:24.773
For now, we rebuild and
forget the time that our city

01:09:24.805 --> 01:09:26.741
was run over by a monkey.

01:09:27.408 --> 01:09:30.946
We now bring you back
to Fun with Marmalade,

01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:32.948
already in progress.

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:33.849
Good night.

01:12:23.518 --> 01:12:24.853
What's that?

01:12:30.956 --> 01:12:35.956
