[theme music playing]

01:06.941 --> 01:08.151
-[alarm blares]
-[gasps]

01:08.234 --> 01:09.319
What's happening?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.571
Six hostile ships
have entered the system, sir.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.907
Prepare armaments
and power the satellites.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.409
How did they make it past
initial detection?

01:17.327 --> 01:20.205
This is the Voltron Coalition.
Lay down your arms and--

01:20.288 --> 01:21.289
Open fire!

01:22.707 --> 01:24.542
[Lance] Well, that didn't take long!

01:26.419 --> 01:28.588
[Hunk] Fighters launching!
Six o'clock low!

01:29.088 --> 01:31.049
[Keith] Remember,
shoot them down if needed,

01:31.132 --> 01:33.635
but try to avoid collateral damage
on the ground.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.054
-[alarm beeping]
-Shield status.

01:36.137 --> 01:40.058
[Iverson] Holding steady at 95 percent,
but the ground cannons have us targeted.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.060
Let's give the Lions some backup.

01:42.143 --> 01:45.063
Adjust our heading down
to one point zero five.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.066
-[Coran] Adjusting course.
-[Shiro] Lock on to the ground cannons.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.151
-[Iverson] We have weapons lock.
-Fire!

01:55.115 --> 01:56.366
[Iverson] Prepare for launch.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.701
Once you're locked in,
you've got three seconds.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.870
Anticipate, but don't jump the gun.

02:00.954 --> 02:01.871
[pilots] Copy.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.797
[Griffin] Team, we've got to clear a path
for the rebel ships.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.714
Let's move!

02:16.469 --> 02:17.929
[air hisses]

02:27.313 --> 02:30.024
[Keith] Paladins, let's take out
their reinforcements.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.367
[rumbling]

02:39.450 --> 02:40.827
[Lahn] Damage report!

02:40.910 --> 02:43.371
[officer] We've suffered
little to no casualties, sir,

02:43.454 --> 02:45.874
but half the fleet
has been rendered inoperable.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.301
[beeping]

02:56.801 --> 02:58.428
[computer] Pulse emitters set.

02:59.053 --> 03:02.891
Detonation in three, two, one.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.942
All power is down across the base.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.612
Only the emergency power generators
remain active.

03:15.695 --> 03:19.115
-What about the satellites?
-They should still be operational.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.325
Good.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.914
[distant booming]

03:28.875 --> 03:30.460
-[explosions]
-[crew grunting]

03:30.543 --> 03:33.379
Does anyone have eyes
on where these lasers are coming from?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.548
[Pidge] I'm not seeing anything
on my scanners.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.842
Trying to locate point of origin now.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.260
I'm on it.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.432
[beeps]

03:44.724 --> 03:47.435
[Allura] I've got visual
on two cloaked cannon satellites.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.604
How did we miss those?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.106
It looks like we wormholed
right past them.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.524
Paladins, on me!

03:53.816 --> 03:55.235
Form Voltron!

04:38.778 --> 04:39.612
[sonic boom]

04:47.161 --> 04:48.204
[blade ringing]

04:52.375 --> 04:55.211
[Shiro] Great job making quick work
of the satellites, Paladins.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.463
We've successfully gained control
of the base.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.224
[robot beeping]

05:15.398 --> 05:17.066
This one says he's the leader.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.196
Whoa! Oh! [laughs]

05:22.697 --> 05:24.866
Holy Kaltenecker!
What are you doing here?

05:24.949 --> 05:27.535
It's me, Hunk. Remember?
Paladin of the Yellow Lion?

05:29.078 --> 05:31.372
-We worked together.
-I remember.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.207
Wait, you know this guy?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.043
Yeah, from the Omega Shield.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.712
Oh, that's right, you were
on a space road trip with your mom.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.589
Keith, this is our friend
Lieutenant Lahn.

05:39.672 --> 05:44.135
It's Warlord Lahn now,
and you and I are not friends.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.597
Oh. Okay, uh...

05:48.514 --> 05:50.767
I just thought we bonded
by working together as a team

05:50.850 --> 05:53.019
to fix the Omega Shield
and save your planet, you know?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.313
A Galra-occupied planet, no less.
We saved it.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.106
It's cool. No big deal.

05:57.398 --> 06:01.486
Sendak only attacked the Omega Shield
after we pledged loyalty to Voltron.

06:01.819 --> 06:05.198
Then you disappeared
and left us vulnerable to more attacks.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.533
I vowed to never let that happen again.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.578
It was not our intention
to be gone for so long.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.121
But we're here now.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.333
-To claim victory over us?
-No!

06:15.416 --> 06:17.293
We didn't come here to argue.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.380
Warlord Lahn, we're asking you
to join the Voltron Coalition

06:21.464 --> 06:23.591
to help provide stability to the universe.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.843
What's the alternative?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.472
If you want peace,
if you want to end this war,

06:29.555 --> 06:31.015
there can be no alternative.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.144
You've attained victory,
and I accept defeat.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.939
It doesn't have to be victory or death.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.067
-I know it's the Galra way, but--
-And what do you know of the Galra?

06:41.901 --> 06:45.196
My mother is Galra.
She's a member of the Blade of Marmora.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.322
So am I.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.867
The mutinous Blades have all but perished.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.494
Are they so diminished in numbers

06:51.577 --> 06:54.413
that they're forced to enlist
a half-breed and his mommy?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.835
-[beeping]
-[Pidge] Guys, incoming communication.

06:58.918 --> 06:59.752
Patch it through.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.924
[distorted male voice]
Yordam bering exus.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.844
Yordam bering exus.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.763
Yordam bering exus.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.808
It's an emergency protocol
built into the sentries

07:13.891 --> 07:15.309
when they're under distress.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.688
Has your Voltron Coalition
attacked them as well?

07:18.771 --> 07:20.898
No, we didn't.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.818
[Shiro] Pidge, see if you can reopen
the hailing frequency.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.903
I'm trying, but no response.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.239
I'm locating the transmission's origin,

07:28.322 --> 07:31.993
but the EMPs we set off have done a number
on the communications systems.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.744
-[rapid beeping]
-Huh?

07:34.162 --> 07:37.039
We got a comm signature.
Do you recognize this ship?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.376
Yes, it's Klytax V-Three.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.088
It's one of the 15 ships I sent
on an assignment six phoebs ago.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.841
They all disappeared.
We assumed them dead.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.302
It looks like they're not dead after all.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.511
We need to get out there.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.055
Shiro, how long before the Atlas is ready
to launch again?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.892
Hours. We still need to process
all the Galra

07:55.975 --> 07:58.519
and prepare the planet
to continue operating on its own.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.355
This is our mission.
We need to see this through.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.274
Then Voltron will go.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.068
Voltron is going to save the Galra?

08:06.402 --> 08:09.322
My fleet would never believe
Voltron was there to help.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.574
They'd fight you until their last breath.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.701
That's why you're coming with us.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.465
[Kosmo growling]

08:27.548 --> 08:29.800
What was this fleet's mission
when they left?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.802
They were out gathering munitions.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.639
[Allura] Weapons?
Were you buying or stealing them?

08:35.348 --> 08:38.226
The Galra Empire is at war with itself.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.895
We have to do what we can to survive.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.355
But if you must know,

08:42.438 --> 08:45.608
they were salvaging weapons
from an abandoned Galra base.

08:45.983 --> 08:46.984
I have visual.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.908
[Keith] Everyone, stay alert.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.910
[Lance] What happened here?

08:56.160 --> 09:01.290
[Hunk] Uh, Warlord Lahn, didn't you say
there were 15 cruisers?

09:02.124 --> 09:03.334
Where are the rest of them?

09:03.751 --> 09:05.545
[Pidge] I'm not detecting
any signs of life

09:05.628 --> 09:07.255
or biorhythms on the closest two ships,

09:07.338 --> 09:10.091
but there are some signals
coming from the ship at the end.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.636
[Lahn] That's Klytax V-Three,
where the call came from.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.557
-[electronic chirping]
-Hailing Galra Cruiser Klytax V-Three.

09:18.057 --> 09:21.060
This is Keith,
Paladin of the Black Lion of Voltron.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.728
Do you copy?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.855
[static hissing]

09:27.358 --> 09:30.444
This is Warlord Lahn, your commander.
Do you copy?

09:31.779 --> 09:34.657
[distorted male voice]
Yordam bering exus.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.203
Yordam bering exus.

09:39.870 --> 09:40.997
Whoever's in there,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.748
we need to find them and get them out.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.751
[Pidge] If I can access
the ship's security network,

09:45.835 --> 09:47.837
we should be able to find out
what happened here.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.966
[Keith] Paladins,
Lahn and I are gonna head in first

09:52.049 --> 09:53.593
to make sure the entry point is safe.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.219
You guys jetpack in behind us.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.554
[Paladins] Copy.

09:56.804 --> 09:57.638
[Kosmo zaps]

10:07.732 --> 10:08.941
[Keith] We're all clear.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.943
Lahn, open the airlock doors.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.177
[Keith] Pidge, are you picking up
any signals?

10:36.260 --> 10:40.014
There are multiple biorhythms,
but they're intermittent, almost random.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.557
It doesn't make any sense.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.186
Okay, we'll need to split up
to find any survivors.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.688
Hunk and Lance,
clear the aft of the ship.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.982
I'll take the bow
and work my way toward you.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.110
Pidge and Allura, take Lahn
to go through the security logs.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.528
Find out what happened here.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.615
[Lahn] I don't like taking orders
on my own ship.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.617
Duly noted.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.343
[Keith] Nobody's here.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.807
-[electronic chirping]
-[alarm blaring]

11:22.890 --> 11:24.392
[Lahn sighs] It's useless!

11:24.475 --> 11:27.269
The ship is in lockdown
and the systems can't be rebooted.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.189
We'll need to contact my base
for the security keys.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.024
Okay. Or we could just do this.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.443
[beeping]

11:43.160 --> 11:44.412
What's wrong with it?

11:44.495 --> 11:47.498
I'm not sure.
It appears to be corrupted.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.291
Let me see if I can clean this up.

11:58.884 --> 12:03.305
[Lahn] Everything I've spent years
fighting for, taken away in an instant.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.226
I, too, have lost everything.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.895
My planet, my family.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.941
But when the Paladins arrived
at the Castle of Lions--

12:14.150 --> 12:17.445
[Lahn] You've never had to earn power.
It's always been given to you!

12:17.903 --> 12:22.199
You're looking for something you once had:
security, peace, happiness.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.703
Those things have never been part
of a Galra soldier's life.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.747
You and I are not the same.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.877
You want something to call your own.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.546
Believe it or not, I understand that.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.007
But there are other ways to get it
than through force.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.177
That's what the coalition is offering.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.974
[Hunk] The escape pods are still here.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.934
[Lance] Yeah, but the Galra aren't.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.896
Everyone is gone, but no one escaped
in one of these things.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.814
Ugh, that's creepy.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.702
[Hunk whimpering]

13:08.120 --> 13:10.164
[whimpering]

13:11.540 --> 13:12.374
[screams]

13:12.458 --> 13:14.293
It's a massacre!
We got to get out of here!

13:14.376 --> 13:18.005
-[screaming] It's all over me!
-Me, too! Lance, get it off of me!

13:18.297 --> 13:19.757
Get it off! Ah!

13:19.840 --> 13:22.009
Oh, wait. Wait a minute.
It's food goo!

13:22.384 --> 13:24.512
[Lance] It's not coming off!
[screaming]

13:24.595 --> 13:25.971
Oh, it's rotten food goo!

13:26.055 --> 13:28.015
Gross! [gags]

13:35.189 --> 13:36.315
What could have done this?

13:36.398 --> 13:39.109
-[distant banging]
-[gasps]

13:39.193 --> 13:40.986
[whirring and banging continues]

13:41.070 --> 13:42.029
[gasps]

13:42.112 --> 13:43.280
[whirring and banging]

13:48.369 --> 13:50.538
-[electronic chirping]
-I think I've got something.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.500
The soldier is here,
but after the flash, he's gone.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.378
But now the shadow
is on the other side of the screen.

13:57.711 --> 14:00.339
-Perhaps it's from another soldier.
-I don't think so.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.675
That's less than a tenth of a second.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.554
Hold on, it looks like the trajectory
of the lighting angles

14:06.637 --> 14:10.474
combined with the proximity to the soldier
are distorting the shadow's shape.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.731
[Lahn] What is that thing?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.361
-[creature snarls]
-[both gasp]

14:22.444 --> 14:24.446
[snarling continues]

14:28.075 --> 14:29.952
-[gasps]
-[screaming]

14:40.754 --> 14:43.841
[rumbling]

14:47.761 --> 14:49.597
[roars]

14:53.100 --> 14:56.145
[Pidge] Guys, be on the lookout
for a giant, deadly monster.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.273
[Allura] We believe it's what attacked
the crew. Avoid at all costs.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.025
[Pidge] Lance, Hunk, do you copy?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.236
[roars]

15:04.737 --> 15:05.571
[both screaming]

15:06.238 --> 15:07.740
Guys, are you okay?

15:08.282 --> 15:09.742
Lance? Hunk?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.746
-We're okay.
-[Lance whimpering]

15:22.046 --> 15:24.048
[Pidge] Keith, we just contacted
Lance and Hunk.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.550
-They saw something. Be advised...
-[computer crackles]

15:31.722 --> 15:33.974
[snarling]

15:34.683 --> 15:36.769
[Pidge] Keith?
Keith, can you hear me?

15:36.852 --> 15:37.728
[Hunk panting]

15:38.187 --> 15:39.480
[Allura] Are you two okay?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.857
Yeah, we're fine,
but we need to get out of here now!

15:41.941 --> 15:43.108
Why? What happened?

15:43.734 --> 15:45.736
It was... monster. Ah.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.321
Blue flash. Almost died.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.406
I got rotten food goo.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.783
Wait, where's Keith?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.539
-Hello?
-[growling]

15:57.623 --> 16:00.125
[male voice] What are you?

16:02.378 --> 16:04.922
What are you?

16:05.839 --> 16:09.927
My name is Keith, leader of Voltron,
Paladin of the Black Lion.

16:10.886 --> 16:11.720
Wait.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.847
Yordam bering exus.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.099
Is that you?

16:15.182 --> 16:18.102
[sentry] Where are the rest of the Galra?

16:18.769 --> 16:21.855
They're still on planet Ryker. Why?

16:22.314 --> 16:24.316
[sentry] Planet Ryker.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.362
[roaring]

16:29.113 --> 16:30.114
[grunts]

16:30.656 --> 16:31.657
[grunts]

16:36.161 --> 16:37.371
[grunts]

16:37.955 --> 16:39.707
[screaming, groans]

16:45.045 --> 16:47.006
-[grunts]
-[roars]

16:49.591 --> 16:52.845
[Pidge] Keith and I were in communication
right before we got disconnected.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.597
It must have been that thing.
You said you saw the creature, right?

16:55.806 --> 16:58.642
Oh, yeah!
Face-to-horrifying-face!

16:58.726 --> 17:02.396
[Lahn] We just watched that thing take out
one of my men in an instant.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.940
How did you two
manage to escape unscathed?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.526
-[rumbling]
-[Hunk] What's happening now?

17:09.862 --> 17:13.157
The ship's moving,
and it's headed towards Lahn's base!

17:14.450 --> 17:15.659
Oh, Keith! Good, you're here.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.536
There's a monster on the ship!

17:17.619 --> 17:20.914
The base you sent this fleet to plunder,
was it Warlord Ranveig's?

17:21.206 --> 17:22.916
[Lahn] Yes, it was.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.170
-Unbelievable.
-[Allura] Keith, what's going on?

17:26.253 --> 17:29.923
The creature on this ship is a superweapon
designed to destroy the Galra,

17:30.007 --> 17:31.091
and only Galra.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.053
[Lahn] Warlord Ranveig
would never create such a thing.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.221
Ranveig found the creature
in the Quantum Abyss

17:36.305 --> 17:38.766
and experimented on it
with Lotor's Quintessence.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.518
He trained it to take out
his Galran enemies, but...

17:41.602 --> 17:43.062
he could never control it.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.023
The beast couldn't differentiate
between adversaries and allies.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.818
Wait, how do you know so much
about this super-monster-weapon-thingy?

17:49.902 --> 17:54.156
Because Krolia and I let it loose
so we could escape Ranveig's base.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.325
This is all my fault.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.701
I'm sorry.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.329
[Lahn] It's what you've wanted
from the beginning.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.873
Something to get rid of the Galra for you.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.001
I don't know what it's gonna take
to get it through your skull,

18:06.085 --> 18:07.336
but we're not your enemy.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.714
Pidge, can you initiate
the self-destruct protocol?

18:11.173 --> 18:13.467
We need to destroy this ship
and the monster with it.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.135
And we need to do it immediately.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.553
Okay, I'm on it.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.390
Once I initiate, we'll have
two doboshes to exit the ship.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.102
-Two hours? Isn't that too long?
-[others] Minutes!

18:23.185 --> 18:24.895
What? That's not enough time!

18:26.063 --> 18:27.856
Let's move! [grunts]

18:27.940 --> 18:29.441
[growling]

18:29.608 --> 18:33.445
[sentry] All Galra must perish.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.656
[roaring]

18:36.949 --> 18:37.950
[grunts]

18:40.119 --> 18:42.538
-[snarling]
-[Kosmo whimpering]

18:43.831 --> 18:45.290
-Ah!
-[Hunk panting]

18:45.541 --> 18:47.417
[Lance shouting] Come on!

18:49.002 --> 18:51.088
[Lance] How much time
before the ship explodes?

18:51.171 --> 18:52.214
Sixty ticks.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.925
-We've got to get them out of there.
-This should do it.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.430
-That thing overrode my protocol!
-We can take it down with our bayards.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.933
-[Allura] Keith!
-[Lance] We're coming for you!

19:03.016 --> 19:04.268
[Hunk] Stand away from the door!

19:06.353 --> 19:08.021
[shouting]

19:08.564 --> 19:09.606
[grunts]

19:15.821 --> 19:17.072
[grunts, groans]

19:20.450 --> 19:22.161
[Lahn] Victory or death!

19:22.286 --> 19:23.120
[grunts]

19:37.509 --> 19:38.760
Do you trust me yet?

19:40.262 --> 19:42.931
[Keith] Paladins, clear the hallway.
We're coming through!

19:48.687 --> 19:49.563
Let's go!

19:51.523 --> 19:53.567
[beeping]

19:56.778 --> 19:57.613
[growls]

19:58.113 --> 19:59.072
Ten ticks!

19:59.156 --> 20:01.617
The cargo bay where we entered
is the nearest exit point.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.868
-[zaps]
-[growls]

20:11.919 --> 20:13.921
-Five ticks! We'll never make it!
-[rapid beeping]

20:26.767 --> 20:27.768
[rapid beeping]

20:37.653 --> 20:41.281
[all screaming]

20:41.365 --> 20:43.116
[roars]

20:57.589 --> 20:59.841
[Lahn] The Galra Empire
may be decimated,

20:59.925 --> 21:02.928
but its warriors are still needed
to maintain stability.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.723
Twice, the Paladins of Voltron
have risked their lives for me,

21:06.807 --> 21:08.976
and yet I questioned their intent.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.477
I was wrong.

21:11.061 --> 21:15.148
I pledge loyalty to a united front
with the Voltron Coalition.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.693
And I encourage you all to do the same.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.152
[crowd cheering]

21:19.653 --> 21:21.780
I downloaded some intel from that cruiser.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.700
There might be another one
of Honerva's beasts out there.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.742
Another one?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.494
This is just what I feared.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.080
Shiro, we need to adjust
our mission's objective

21:30.163 --> 21:32.457
and track down
where these things are coming from.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.418
How certain are you that it's a Robeast?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.296
I'm not positive,
but according to the message logs,

21:37.379 --> 21:39.673
some Galra have spotted
a giant robotic mech

21:39.756 --> 21:41.133
that fits the description.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.760
The logs even refer to a similar weapon.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.930
There may be another Altean piloting it.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.765
We must investigate.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.101
Thousands of innocent souls
are waiting to be liberated

21:51.184 --> 21:53.061
from what remains of the Galra Empire.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.690
-We can't just change course.
-[Keith] Maybe you don't have to.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.275
Keith, what are you saying?

21:58.650 --> 21:59.568
We'll split up.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.653
The Atlas will continue
working with the Galra

22:01.737 --> 22:04.031
while Voltron searches
for Honerva and her beasts.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.701
You'll be out there on your own,
without backup.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.329
We'll be okay.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.165
Voltron is stronger now more than ever.
