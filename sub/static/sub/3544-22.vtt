00:02.160 --> 00:03.605
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.800 --> 00:07.725
Being around you drives me nuts.
And not being around you drives me nuts.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.888
You two are miserable without each other.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.367
So if you wanna be with him,
just be with him.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.404
I'm sorry but we need to make
the doppelganger blood useless.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.921
One of you needs to die.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.247
The spell started.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.051
The spell will continue to unravel
spirit magic as it spreads.

00:23.520 --> 00:27.889
The Other Side is collapsing and everyone
in it, including me, is going away.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.361
Don't let go! Aah!

00:30.520 --> 00:33.729
I'm pestering all of you till I'm
returned to the land of the living.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.046
Welcome back, Julian.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.521
My wife's dead.
I'm in somebody else's body.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.961
I've got nowhere to go,
my people are trying to kill me.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.889
There, dead doppelganger...

00:50.040 --> 00:51.769
- Oh, my God.
- ...stopped the spell.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.649
No. Somebody help!

01:16.560 --> 01:17.925
Oh, my God, Stefan.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.802
I didn't know where to bring him.
I just couldn't leave him outside.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.609
Bonnie has a plan, right?

01:25.760 --> 01:27.888
She said that she could bring people back.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.967
Tell me that she can bring him back.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.009
We'll bring him back. Come on.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.487
Let's get away from prying eyes.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.689
Okay.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.005
I got you.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.966
Looks like I've saved you
from metaphorical darkness...

02:21.200 --> 02:22.804
and actual darkness.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.570
I think you owe me a beer.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.685
Damon, stop.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.162
- You said you had a plan, Bonnie.
- I did.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.204
- I had a Traveler who knew the spell.
- And you lost her.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.001
I didn't. She was sucked into oblivion
like everyone else on the Other Side.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.084
- Then find another one.
- It's more than just knowing the spell.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.685
Markos was able to come back...

02:51.840 --> 02:55.401
because Travelers were willing to
sacrifice themselves to overwhelm me.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.525
I doubt they'll be willing to do that
for a bunch of supernatural strangers.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.365
You know who needs motivation?
You need motivation.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.205
If the Other Side goes away,
everyone we know there...

03:05.360 --> 03:08.045
- ...including you, goes away with it.
- I know that.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.844
Do you think I wanna die?

03:10.080 --> 03:13.687
My brother is over there.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.006
I know that.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.406
So is Alaric, so is your grams.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.369
I know that, Damon.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.762
Let's not forget who else is at the top
of the search-and-rescue list.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.047
Enzo's here.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.931
Well, if it's not
Mr. Butterfingers himself.

03:42.120 --> 03:46.125
How'd it feel to have your only hope
of coming back slip through your fingers?

03:46.280 --> 03:49.727
Hello to you, too, grumpy pants.
Tell him to play nice, I have a plan.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.247
Are you serious?
You found another Traveler?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.926
- Well, then, get on it.
- I'm already on it, mate.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.649
You'll still need someone to do
this coming-back-from-the-dead spell.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.400
I assume you still have a witch or two
in your pocket?

04:01.920 --> 04:03.046
More or less.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.126
Oh, great. Grandma just passed us.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.971
If you wanna drive, just say so.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.650
No, I want you to drive.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.481
Just at a speed more fitting for two people
who just tried to commit murder.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.207
They are not following us.
Markos stripped the town of spirit magic.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.970
There's no way they survived it.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.969
Something tells me they did.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.286
I bet if I turn around...

04:35.840 --> 04:38.081
Using our own tricks against us.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.561
Jerks.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.209
Little tip.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.966
If you're gonna flee the crime,
take back roads.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.650
You really wanna do this again?

04:50.840 --> 04:55.971
The part where you try to kill a doppelganger?
There's no point, Stefan's already dead.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.610
I know you don't believe me...

05:05.840 --> 05:07.490
but I am sorry.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.846
Good.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.168
Because you're gonna help
bring him back.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.727
Look, I get what you need from us.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.801
But if both doppelgangers are alive again,
the Travelers can re-start their spell.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.170
Witch magic goes bye-bye
and all you vamps, you're goners.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.931
They're not gonna have a chance
to start again.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.890
In order to bring Stefan back,
we're gonna have to kill them.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.203
- A lot of them. Including Markos.
- We can't help you.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.007
Even if we wanted to,
our coven would kill us.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.004
- Stefan saved your life.
- I know he did but...

05:38.160 --> 05:39.207
We can't risk it.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.205
- No!
- Your brother is officially on the Other Side.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.691
Think you can risk it now?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.445
It is a good day, sheriff.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.687
Maybe for you.

06:04.920 --> 06:08.925
It took me all night to evacuate a 10-mile
civilian radius around the town square.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.370
Gas leak. Very clever.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.449
I appreciate your cooperation.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.883
It'll keep our residents away for now
but certainly not forever.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.209
We can think of something
if we put our heads together.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.921
Why did they move our sign?

06:23.040 --> 06:26.203
Our desire was to end
spirit magic everywhere.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.283
As you can see, we hit a snag.

06:28.480 --> 06:32.883
Nevertheless, this is our home now.
Just to keep things simple...

06:33.040 --> 06:36.726
we've reset the official border
of Mystic Falls to where the spell begins.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.888
Right there.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.248
Of all the small towns to call home...

06:41.400 --> 06:44.290
you probably shouldn't have picked one
full of vampires.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.050
You think I'm afraid of vampires?

06:47.920 --> 06:52.448
Maybe you think your friend, Damon,
or your daughter can come save the day.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.925
Let me give an example
of why that would be unwise.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.922
- Tyler.
- Oh, that's not Tyler anymore.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.924
That's Julian,
the Traveler who betrayed his people...

07:09.080 --> 07:12.926
when he killed the doppelganger
and stopped the spell.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.926
A big, scary werewolf-vampire hybrid.

07:17.120 --> 07:21.125
And yet, a little vervain,
a touch of wolfsbane, and here you are.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.770
Weak and all mine.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.844
You think you're a great leader
because you pillage a town?

07:28.040 --> 07:30.805
That makes you king now? Heh.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.164
Sorry, your highness, but I don't buy it.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.125
That's because you haven't set foot
inside my kingdom.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.967
The spell the Travelers cast across
Mystic Falls eliminates spirit magic.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.245
So while my people continue to have access
to the earth's purest magic...

07:47.480 --> 07:51.121
your friend, Tyler, will be stripped of
everything the witches did to him.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.362
First, his hybrid side.
Then, his vampirism.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.641
And with no vampirism to keep him alive...

07:57.760 --> 08:02.322
he'll just be a boy with a werewolf gene
who happened to break his neck.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.165
No. No. No.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.643
Don't do this, no. No. Stop.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.205
Stop. Please don't.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.290
Don't, no, please.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.369
Oh, my God.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.809
One less witch-twin in the world.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.004
No, one more person we need to bring back.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.441
This list is getting uncomfortably long.

08:51.640 --> 08:52.766
Tell me about it.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.169
But with Liv doing the spell,
not bringing her brother back would be...

08:56.360 --> 08:58.169
- Smart? Savvy?
- Cruel.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.805
It would be cruel.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.930
But none of it matters
if your mysterious Traveler doesn't show.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.129
Bonnie?

09:08.880 --> 09:10.370
Tyler?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.451
Is that you?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.244
How the hell did I get here?

09:15.080 --> 09:18.527
You're dead and you're you.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.007
Caroline was right.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.083
Dying eliminated your Passenger.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.362
Hang on.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.411
Did you say I'm dead?

09:28.040 --> 09:29.963
I did, but we can bring you back.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.288
And the list keeps growing.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.563
I need you to trust me, okay?

09:38.480 --> 09:40.005
Do I have a choice?

09:46.520 --> 09:51.401
Class is in session.
First assignment, anti-magic perimeter.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.130
Gilbert? What do you got?

09:53.400 --> 09:57.485
I walked around Mystic Falls this morning to
see where my hunter instincts disappeared.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.570
Meaning what, your biceps shrunk
and your brain got smaller?

10:00.760 --> 10:03.240
Meaning I have a supernatural
urge to kill vampires.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.880
So wherever I hated you less,
there was no magic.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.203
The cemetery's outside
of the no-magic perimeter.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.209
Couple of unpopulated areas,
other than...

10:11.360 --> 10:14.440
<i>Hey, Professor
Salvatore, not everyone can see the map.</i>

10:14.600 --> 10:18.321
- Yeah, don't forget about us.
- Donovan, you had one job.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.284
I'll send you a picture right now.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.009
- We should be there.
- Nope.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.168
You should not be, you're on witch duty...

10:31.320 --> 10:34.210
because without crazy-locks,
no one's rising from the dead.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.161
So next order of business, mass murder.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.726
Quarterback?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.446
Thank you.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.130
I got these from the sheriff.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.681
Apparently, there was truth
to her evacuation story.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.048
A major gas line
runs underneath the town.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.846
Now, if it did leak, it could be deadly.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.082
As in massive explosion kind of deadly.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.691
We can't blow up our hometown.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.009
Says one of the only people left
in this group who can actually live there.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.804
We're not blowing up our town.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.651
We just need to lure enough Travelers
to one spot.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.810
How? We can't lure anyone
anywhere stuck out here.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.241
That's where your mama comes in.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.569
She will convince them
to gather somewhere inside.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.890
Meanwhile, these two geniuses
at 7:00 will turn on the gas, let it leak.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.327
We'll have 10 minutes
before anyone can smell it.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.761
You clear out, boom.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.806
Travelers gone, resurrection spell starts,
loved ones return.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.207
Good? Good?

11:28.280 --> 11:29.486
Class dismissed.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.930
Ha. I thought for sure he'd be here.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.408
If you were a history teacher turned
vampire, where else would you be?

11:38.600 --> 11:41.251
You seem, uh, very intent
on finding someone you barely know.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.403
- I have a thing for day-drinkers.
- Mm.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.250
Plus he has a cute name.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.244
Alaric. Mm.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.891
We'll find him.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.762
Seriously, this is what I have to look
forward to when I come back to life?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.844
- All-you-can-eat potato skins?
- Mm.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.321
Remind me again
why you never made it to Portland.

11:59.520 --> 12:04.208
I was attacked by Silas and locked
in a safe to drown for three months.

12:04.400 --> 12:08.530
Right. And then you made it out
and yet, you're still here.

12:09.360 --> 12:14.048
Either one of us could blink out of existence
any second, so if you have something to say...

12:14.240 --> 12:16.242
- Caroline.
- What about Caroline?

12:16.800 --> 12:20.930
- Wow, you really don't see it, do you?
- See what?

12:21.120 --> 12:25.205
Listen, I might not carry a lot of weight
with you people, but I'm still the sheriff...

12:25.360 --> 12:27.681
and I still represent the people
who live here.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.326
Travelers haven't been able
to gather for centuries.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.529
Last thing they'll tolerate
is a list of your ground rules.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.086
What if there's an open bar.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.880
She's trying to gather the Travelers.
They're planning something.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.127
I should go with you.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.601
You need to go be a younger,
hotter Bruce Willis.

12:47.800 --> 12:54.126
And if I take one step into Mystic Falls,
goodbye magic, goodbye Anchor, goodbye me.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.561
At least, tell me how this works.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.802
<i>Being an Anchor is like being</i> a <i>gateway.</i>

12:59.080 --> 13:02.607
Usually, it's one way, but when
the Travelers die, Liv will do the spell.

13:02.840 --> 13:06.561
Her magic combined with all those Travelers
opening the gate at once...

13:06.760 --> 13:10.890
will allow the people on the Other Side to
push their way through me like Markos did.

13:11.080 --> 13:15.130
- What about you? What happens?
- I stop being the Anchor.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.604
Yeah, but how do you get through?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.888
Jeremy, I'll be fine.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.167
Look, I gotta go, okay? Be careful.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.364
What is your plan, exactly?

13:28.640 --> 13:29.926
MY plan is my job.

13:30.160 --> 13:34.210
Just like the spell is yours,
which apparently you suck at.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.970
We should already be on the road.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.322
I'm late, aren't I? My bad.

13:38.520 --> 13:42.047
I was watching some 80-year-old witch
get dragged off to never-never land.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.925
It was, uh, weirdly entertaining.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.282
- Stefan?
- Not exactly.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.529
Bonnie, meet the Traveler
with our one-way ticket out of here.

13:50.760 --> 13:54.890
Though you may know him better as an ancient
immortal with a desperate need of a cure.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.043
Oh, my God.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.049
Silas.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.651
You killed my dad.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.009
And now, I'm gonna help you
bring your friends back to life.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.850
And me along with them.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.804
So, what do you say...

14:10.040 --> 14:11.644
."bygones?

14:15.920 --> 14:18.287
- Where the hell is Alaric?
- I don't know.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.005
Maybe he finally found peace.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.282
If he did,
I'm gonna be pissed he beat me.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.802
Why didn't you? If anyone
was gonna find peace, it should be you.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.927
I don't know. Maybe there's something I'm
still supposed to do to, earn my stripes.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.849
Let's make a deal.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.082
If all this fails,
and we're stuck here...

14:35.280 --> 14:38.682
we're not gonna let whatever's happening
to these people happen to us.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.963
- We're gonna find peace together.
- A death peace pact?

14:44.520 --> 14:46.284
I like it.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.563
Come on, let's go. I'd hate for you
to miss your come-back-to-life window...

14:49.760 --> 14:53.765
- ...before your first date with Caroline.
- Oh, shut it.

14:58.680 --> 15:02.526
Esvet, not <i>vat.</i> I feel like
I'm teaching calculus to an infant.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.371
I'm a little nervous
about unleashing a plague onto humanity.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.210
Ooh. I've been upgraded to a plague?

15:07.400 --> 15:09.289
Ah. How Biblical and fitting.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.764
Seeing as I probably will kill a lot of people in
an epic, all-inclusive way once I'm out of here.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.928
Oh, speaking of,
how is my shadow self?

15:16.120 --> 15:19.408
Is it a crime for someone so good-looking
to be so sad all the time?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.884
Just teach me the damn spell.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.128
Hey, did you find the Traveler
that's gonna get us out of here?

15:26.320 --> 15:30.245
Yep. Learning the spell as we speak.
I'd introduce you, but, um...

15:30.400 --> 15:31.640
Thank you, whoever you are.

15:31.840 --> 15:37.085
- Oh, just a perfect specimen of man...
- Moody old lady, kind of senile.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.566
Got it.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.529
Well, I'm gonna call Damon.
I'll let him know that we're ready.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.491
Can we talk about the irony of blowing up
the only place dumb enough to hire us?

15:57.720 --> 16:02.089
I'm sure the Salvatores will make
a generous contribution to help fix it.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.169
Yeah, if they can come home.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.722
No one said killing the Travelers
will get rid of this anti-magic thing.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.289
Although Mystic Falls might
be a half-decent place to live again.

16:12.480 --> 16:17.566
No more vampire attacks,
crazy blood rituals, you know? Safe.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.841
Like it used to be.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.924
Except that I wouldn't be able to invite
my girlfriend over.

16:22.160 --> 16:26.085
There are worse things than having to visit
your girl at college on weekends, Jer.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.645
It's called normal.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.166
We're here.

16:33.520 --> 16:37.081
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS

16:53.280 --> 16:56.329
I warned you they probably
wouldn't give you the chance to speak.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.841
They don't seem to have a problem
with free food.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.206
Where are you going?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.287
I'm clearly not gonna have
much of an impact here.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.529
So I think it's time I take my own orders
and evacuate.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.248
We're not lawless, you know.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.329
We could use someone like you.
Have a drink with me.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.287
Allow me to convince you
this can be your home.

17:17.480 --> 17:21.565
My home is a place my daughter
can come visit. Goodbye.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.130
Please, I insist.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.364
- So you're good?
- Operation Massacre.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.848
Assuming Donovan knows the difference
between a water and a gas main...

17:36.040 --> 17:37.883
yeah, I'm good.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.046
Listen, I wanted to spare you
the gory details.

17:43.240 --> 17:46.403
Then I figured, I'd be lying
and the point of saving the universe...

17:46.600 --> 17:48.523
will be moot because you'd be pissed.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.449
So here it is.

17:51.520 --> 17:56.367
Project Kaboom needs someone
to trigger the explosion, so to speak.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.602
Okay.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.001
Wait, you?

18:01.240 --> 18:04.130
No, Damon. No, absolutely not, no.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.563
Go with your first instinct, Damon.
Lesson learned.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.445
Look at me, Damon.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.924
Do you see a future with me?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.729
Because that's all I see.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.606
Elena, I've seen it since the second
I laid eyes on you.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.167
Then don't go on a suicide mission.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.170
Listen, technically,
it's only half a suicide mission.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.842
We're gonna be bringing people back
and I'm gonna be with them.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.605
What if something goes wrong?

18:34.320 --> 18:40.089
All right, not to relive old fights,
but this is my choice.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.805
And I need you to respect it.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.044
That was a low blow.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.084
Hey, I will make it back to you.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.890
I promise.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.204
I promise you.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.761
Everything all right in there?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.207
We're good.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.608
But Silas is a crappy mentor, FYI.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.889
It's back.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.882
She's ready, let's get on with it.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.328
Help me.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.731
Bygones.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.768
You can do this, Liv.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.047
All right, it's 7:00 on the dot. Let's go.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.724
Come on, Grams.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.483
Where are you?

21:28.480 --> 21:31.245
Didn't I teach you not to rush your elders?

21:31.960 --> 21:33.849
We move a little slower.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.607
- Thank God. I found us all a way out.
- Think I was born yesterday?

21:37.760 --> 21:39.524
I know what you're doing.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.690
You cannot survive all these people
coming through you.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.123
And even if you could,
when it's all said and done...

21:47.280 --> 21:49.601
you're still the Anchor.
And when this place...

21:49.760 --> 21:52.525
- I know what you're about to say.
- No, you don't.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.121
I was going to say...

21:55.600 --> 22:00.640
that it's been my privilege to watch you
grow into the beautiful woman you've become.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.885
You need to pass through me
when the ritual begins.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.645
No.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.407
I'm staying here.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.763
Grams, you can't.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.722
This place is imploding
and taking everyone with it.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.251
I can't come, Bonnie.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.002
You're not the only member of this family
who knows how to make a sacrifice.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.321
What does that mean?

22:28.520 --> 22:30.170
It means that I'm gonna be fine.

22:31.760 --> 22:32.841
I found peace...

22:34.160 --> 22:36.925
because I made sure
that you'll find yours.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.285
I don't understand.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.442
Not your concern.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.451
Just know I looked out for you.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.007
I love you, Bonnie.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.962
You stay strong.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.326
I love you.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.008
Third phone call in five minutes.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.969
- Look, what am I doing here?
- I was wondering the same thing.

23:52.240 --> 23:57.007
You evacuated the town, yet you stayed
to lecture us on our civic duties?

23:57.640 --> 23:59.165
Captain goes down with his ship.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.843
Or you're up to something.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.890
Do you smell gas?

24:14.120 --> 24:17.408
I think there's a leak
coming from the hatch.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.285
What the hell are you doing?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.928
You said to respect your choice.
And I did.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.481
Now you can respect mine.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.081
Whoa.
No. No, that's not how this works, Elena.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.164
The second we cross that border
you're gonna feel everything.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.928
You're gonna drown again. Take you
back to the night you died a human.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.003
I know what I signed up for, Damon.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.440
And I'm all in.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.124
What are you staring at?

25:32.320 --> 25:33.446
Drive.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.046
Hurry. We have to die while
we're still vampires...

25:59.520 --> 26:00.726
No.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.090
No. Come on.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.364
Damon.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.445
I know.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.880
I know.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.890
Just keep going.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.690
We meet again.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.969
We can do this all day, Bonnie.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.925
Your friends kill me
and I come right back through you.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.924
I look forward to the déja vu.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.766
- Bonnie.
- Elena.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.249
Did it work? Are you...?

27:28.440 --> 27:30.442
- Yes.
- Yeah?

27:30.640 --> 27:32.642
- Did Damon...?
- Right here.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.887
Okay.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.084
When you pass through me, you're gonna
wake up on the Other Side.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.521
- I need you to get back here as fast as you can.
- Okay.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.241
Did you seriously wear your seat belt?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.650
Oh, my God.

28:06.840 --> 28:07.966
Alaric, what are you...?

28:08.200 --> 28:09.690
Come on. You gotta go.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.084
What about Damon? I need to find him.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.250
No, you need to go home to your brother.
I'll find Damon.

28:15.480 --> 28:18.131
- I can't...
- Come on, Elena. Get out of here.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.847
- Go.
- Okay.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.080
Liz. No. No, no.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.804
Come on.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.250
Friendly advice,
when you finally get the girl...

29:14.240 --> 29:15.605
don't blow her up.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.762
- Good to see you too, buddy.
- Yeah.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.049
I think she's gonna be okay.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.404
Bonnie. Bonnie.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.247
Bonnie! Hey!

29:40.440 --> 29:43.091
Look, it's too much for her.
We need to start now.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.447
No. We go together.
Damon isn't here yet.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.803
I don't care.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.724
Hey. Liv.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.326
Liv.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.164
Hey, look, you need to stop now, okay?
If you keep going, it's gonna kill you.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.801
No. I promised that I'd help them.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.046
You need to come through.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.844
What about everyone else?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.323
You don't have to tell me twice.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.770
Whew.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.287
Ah.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.841
See you around, gorgeous.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.807
- Tyler?
- Yeah. It's me.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.324
- Whoa.
- What's wrong?

30:46.480 --> 30:48.130
That felt different.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.124
What do you mean?

31:03.400 --> 31:04.640
You're not healing.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.162
I'm not a hybrid anymore.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.488
Come on, guys, we don't have much time.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.085
Grab my hand.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.762
- Go. Go. You have to go. Come on.
- No.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.371
I can't find Damon.

31:25.560 --> 31:29.281
- You go. I'll wait here.
- No, I'm not leaving without him.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.687
- This place is falling apart.
- No.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.045
Elena, thank God.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.565
No, Bonnie. Why would you do that?

31:39.760 --> 31:41.762
- I can't leave without him.
- We'll find him.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.651
What's going on?
Who are we missing? Where's Stefan?

31:46.040 --> 31:47.451
Are you okay?

31:47.600 --> 31:49.090
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.611
Bonnie?

31:53.200 --> 31:56.363
No. No. No.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.011
- Stefan.
- I was just trying...

31:58.200 --> 31:59.326
- What's wrong?
- She fell.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.840
- I was trying...
- What?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.200
Damon. He's not there yet.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.807
- This isn't happening.
- It's okay.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.729
I can do this.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.891
Bonnie.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.721
This is killing you, isn't it?

32:29.840 --> 32:31.171
I can hold on.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.081
I have to. Just come through.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.486
We have to finish this.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.807
Not just yet.

32:50.840 --> 32:54.367
Lexi. Come on. It's your turn.

32:55.360 --> 32:59.001
Every person that passes through
takes you one step closer to death.

33:00.520 --> 33:05.447
What kind of a best friend would I be if you
died before Stefan got his brother back?

33:16.120 --> 33:18.168
You're not gonna get me.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.525
Bonnie.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.007
Thank God.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.571
Screw those guys.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.843
I won't let you die for them.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.726
- Where's Elena?
- She made it through.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.929
- Okay.
- Come on.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.927
Well, would you look at that?

34:30.360 --> 34:31.485
Oh, my God.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.166
No. No. No.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.885
Bonnie. We need to find them.

34:37.040 --> 34:40.168
- We need to start the spell again.
- We can't. That was our one shot.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.045
But Damon's on the Other Side.
We have to...

34:43.239 --> 34:44.685
Elena.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.404
It's too late.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.205
No.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.607
No.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.731
He's here.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.330
You can say goodbye.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.009
I lost them both.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.209
Two people I've known longest
in this world...

35:55.760 --> 35:57.524
both gone.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.283
Lexi?

36:03.200 --> 36:05.168
She never came out.

36:06.800 --> 36:10.441
Neither did Markos.
I know that's not a coincidence.

36:11.720 --> 36:15.008
It was her, uh, unfinished business.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.604
And Damon, uh...

36:23.600 --> 36:26.729
He finally had everything he wanted.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.603
He was happy.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.123
He should be here.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.807
You lied to me.

36:56.120 --> 36:59.169
Even if I wanted to apologize...

36:59.640 --> 37:01.642
you couldn't hear me.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.850
So I won't.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.886
Please, don't leave me.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.846
I don't have a choice, baby.

37:14.280 --> 37:20.606
You are by far the greatest thing that ever
happened to me in my 173 years on this earth.

37:21.960 --> 37:25.123
The fact that I get to die
knowing that I was loved...

37:25.360 --> 37:26.600
not just by anyone...

37:27.720 --> 37:31.247
by you, Elena Gilbert...

37:31.880 --> 37:34.804
is the epitome of a fulfilled life.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.926
It was never really gonna get
any better than this.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.611
I peaked.

38:12.320 --> 38:15.961
I love you, Elena.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.604
Please.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.490
Please come back to me.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.761
Bye.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.409
Come back to me.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.249
<i>It was all</i> a <i>lie.</i>

38:42.600 --> 38:45.410
There was never a way for me to stop
being the Anchor.

38:46.920 --> 38:50.447
When the Other Side goes, I go with it.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.887
You told me you could come back.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.770
<i>If I would've told you the truth...</i>

38:55.840 --> 38:57.968
it would've changed
our last days together.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.844
I didn't want it to change.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.561
We were happy.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.250
So none of it was true?

39:05.520 --> 39:06.760
<i>Bonnie.</i>

39:07.440 --> 39:09.761
Don't move, okay? I'm coming to you.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.884
I died, Jer.

39:13.160 --> 39:16.289
I died the day before our graduation...

39:16.480 --> 39:18.801
and the rest of this has been a gift.

39:19.320 --> 39:22.449
<i>And I choose to be thankful
that I didn't waste a second of it.</i>

39:23.160 --> 39:24.571
So...

39:27.680 --> 39:29.170
take care of Elena.

39:29.320 --> 39:32.688
No. Don't you dare hang up on me.

39:32.840 --> 39:34.444
- I love you.
- Bonnie.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.371
Bonnie, don't you dare...

39:41.680 --> 39:43.170
The main gas line's off, Jer.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.287
Jer?

39:47.480 --> 39:49.164
I need to get to Bonnie.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.007
He's gone.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.609
Bonnie!

40:28.480 --> 40:30.209
Bonnie!

40:33.400 --> 40:34.606
Bonnie!

40:35.040 --> 40:36.849
Bonnie!

40:37.120 --> 40:38.724
Bonnie!

40:42.240 --> 40:43.844
What's going on?

40:44.080 --> 40:45.241
Bonnie!

40:45.760 --> 40:47.967
Bonnie!

40:48.160 --> 40:49.366
Bonnie!

41:12.360 --> 41:14.362
This place is going down, isn't it?

41:14.560 --> 41:16.324
It is.

41:18.120 --> 41:22.091
I'm sure there are a million people
we'd both rather be with right now.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.561
But...

41:28.560 --> 41:30.449
Couple thousand at most.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.643
Do you think it'll hurt?

41:47.360 --> 41:48.441
I don't kno...
