00:50.183 --> 00:52.018
Look up here. Eyes up here.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.286
I'm Mr. Shifrin.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.954
I'm your substitute teacher
for today.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.890
If you guys could
all just be quiet

00:56.956 --> 00:58.458
for one second,
that'd be great.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.126
I just got a few things
we gotta go over, okay?

01:00.226 --> 01:02.695
Hello? I am demanding respect.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.130
I demand respect.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.465
- Tom, you see what I see?

01:05.565 --> 01:06.900
- Yeah,
the sub's losing control.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.201
- Let's go loiter
in the bathroom.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.469
- Loiter?
We're not allowed.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.804
We're in class.
- We got a sub.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.305
The laws of society
no longer apply.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.973
- No, no, no, I've had
too many incidents.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.809
I can't get in trouble.
- We won't get in trouble.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.310
This guy's clueless.
Look at him.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.479
- Let's bring
the noise level down, okay?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.481
That is rude.
- I mean, if he let us leave,

01:21.581 --> 01:23.716
we done nothing wrong.
- Why would he let us leave?

01:23.783 --> 01:24.651
- Watch this.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.985
- I am a grown man,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.555
and I am in a position
of authority.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.423
- Hey, uh,
can we be excused from class?

01:30.490 --> 01:31.891
We have
chiropractor appointments.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.660
- Yeah, joint
chiropractor appointments.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.428
- Is that a pun
or do you have

01:35.495 --> 01:37.163
simultaneous chiropractor
appointments?

01:37.263 --> 01:39.966
- Yeah, I've got a bad back,
and he's got a bad foot, so...

01:40.066 --> 01:41.835
- I have a note by the way.
Here you go.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.237
- I can't argue with this.
What are your names?

01:44.304 --> 01:46.339
- Just put down Hank and Irv.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.007
- All right, cool.
Yeah, I'll write it down.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.843
- We can leave?
- Yeah, I mean, you got a note.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.612
- Come on, Irv.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.114
Whoo!
- Oh, my God, it worked.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.515
We're on the loose.
- Yeah!

01:55.615 --> 01:56.983
- What do we do?
Go in the bathroom?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.352
- Guys, I'm in.
- In where? In with what?

01:59.452 --> 02:00.620
- I'm in with

02:00.687 --> 02:02.589
whatever weird stuff
is going on here.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.124
- Oh, no.
- Let's get in some trouble.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.692
- That seems a little
out of character, no?

02:05.792 --> 02:07.660
- My brother gets in trouble
all the time,

02:07.760 --> 02:09.762
but my mom expects me
to be perfect?

02:09.829 --> 02:11.131
- All right, what you thinking?

02:11.197 --> 02:12.832
- Small fires,

02:12.932 --> 02:14.534
defecating on walls...

02:14.634 --> 02:16.836
- What? I signed up
for loitering, that's it.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.205
- Ah, busted!
- Oh, no.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.707
- You guys have hall passes?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.142
- All right,
I guess we're busted.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.710
Don't tell the principal.
- I'm kidding.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.478
I don't give a shit
about hall passes.

02:25.545 --> 02:26.846
I'm a janitor.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.314
What kinda trouble
you guys getting into?

02:28.381 --> 02:30.049
I love this stuff.
- Pretty messed up.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.051
We made fake
chiropractor notes.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.720
- Yeah, now we loitering
by the bathroom.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.022
- That's it? That's what
passes for trouble these days?

02:36.122 --> 02:37.390
- You know,
let's go back to class.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.725
Let's pretend
this never happened.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.893
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.494
You can't go back to class.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.897
Years from now,
your best memories of childhood

02:43.997 --> 02:45.899
will be when you misbehaved.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.467
Do you know what
"carpe diem" means?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.235
- No; I learned Latin
for the spelling bee,

02:49.335 --> 02:50.737
but it didn't really stick.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.472
- It means "seize the day."

02:52.539 --> 02:54.407
Look, if you wanna
leave school grounds,

02:54.507 --> 02:56.843
I'd be happy to smuggle you out
in my garbage can.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.545
- All right, this guy's
clearly lost his mind.

02:58.645 --> 02:59.646
- We're in!
- In?

02:59.712 --> 03:00.647
- Everybody in the can.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.015
- What? No, no, please.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.650
- Get in the trash,
you little rebels.

03:03.716 --> 03:04.984
- I'm not getting
in the garbage can.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.419
- It's been
a light garbage day,

03:06.519 --> 03:07.921
so you'll both fit.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.659
Look, you want me
to drive you to a bar?

03:12.725 --> 03:13.826
- Oh, no,
we're gonna part ways.

03:13.893 --> 03:15.261
You can't be part of the team.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.431
- I wanna hang out
with you guys.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.933
I'm lonely.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.834
- No, that--that's
where I draw the line.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.705
Wow, what an adventure.
We walked to Taco Bell.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.106
That's crazy.
Should we head back?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.241
- What are
we gonna tell people?

03:28.341 --> 03:30.009
We stood in line for tacos?

03:30.076 --> 03:31.444
- That sounds like
a good story.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.213
I'd tell--I'd tell
my grandkids that story.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.881
- Oh, my goodness.
- I've got an idea.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.416
Why don't we just
dine and dash?

03:36.516 --> 03:37.517
- Yes!
- Stop, stop.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.052
No, no, no.
- Yes.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.287
Tom, let's use that honest
little face of yours.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.223
You get up there,
you do the talking.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.524
- Whatever happened
to loitering?

03:44.591 --> 03:45.625
I thought that was the plan.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.693
- Yeah, but now we about to

03:46.759 --> 03:47.927
put the whole plan together,

03:48.027 --> 03:50.263
which is a Taco Bell heist.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.432
- Okay, fine,
one quick Taco Bell heist,

03:52.532 --> 03:53.900
and then
we're going back to school.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.936
Hey, can I just get,
like, 30 tacos?

03:57.036 --> 03:59.305
- Oh, wow, do you want them
in the Fiesta Party Packs

03:59.405 --> 04:00.974
or do you want them individual?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.775
- Yeah, just a couple
of Fiesta Party Packs.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.143
- Okay.
- And then we'll just

04:04.244 --> 04:05.778
settle the bill later.
So, you know.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.814
- So you want me to
give them to you on a tray

04:07.914 --> 04:10.283
and then watch you
come back and pay?

04:10.383 --> 04:11.718
- You don't have to
watch anything.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.253
Just typical restaurant stuff,
you know.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.655
- This isn't a restaurant.
This is fast food.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.624
- Just give us the food.
Be cool, come on.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.325
- You see this guy behind me?
- Yeah.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.160
- Okay, that's
the assistant manager.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.497
Do you know how
freaking hard he would get

04:24.597 --> 04:25.832
if he could fire me for this?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.400
- I just want to be clear,
we're not, like,

04:27.467 --> 04:28.901
dining and dashing or anything.

04:28.968 --> 04:30.603
- It sounds like you're
trying to dine and dash.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.739
- Why, 'cause I just said
we're not dining and dashing?

04:32.805 --> 04:34.907
- Okay, bye.
- Very disappointing.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.609
Very disappointing
restaurant experience.

04:36.676 --> 04:37.844
- Go ahead and write a review.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.345
I dare you to take the time.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.514
- As soon as I get a phone
and open a Yelp account,

04:41.614 --> 04:42.982
this place is gonna hear it.

04:43.082 --> 04:44.317
- Lord, save me

04:44.417 --> 04:46.486
if I'm still here
when that happens.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.854
- Come on, Tom!
- I'm sorry.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.689
- Rule number one
of dining and dashing,

04:49.789 --> 04:50.957
don't discuss dashing.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.292
- All right, well,
that didn't work.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.693
Let's head back to school and--

04:53.793 --> 04:55.028
- No! Since you
screwed up the heist,

04:55.128 --> 04:56.362
we have to do something else.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.031
Let's, uh--I don't know.
Let's hitchhike.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.699
- All right,
you're out of control.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.934
- Let's take a vote.
Nelson, do you wanna hitchhike?

05:02.001 --> 05:03.036
- Uh, I gotta go with Dakota.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.370
- Nelson, please, come on.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.805
- You blew it with
the dining and dash,

05:05.872 --> 05:07.473
so we gotta take it
to another level.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.776
find the creepiest weirdo we can

05:09.842 --> 05:11.544
and get in their vehicle.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.547
- Hey, kids. What's up?

05:14.647 --> 05:16.482
You guys need a ride?
- Sorry, buddy.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.484
You're not creepy enough.
Keep it moving.

05:18.551 --> 05:19.986
- All right,
down the block I go.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.721
- Let's just--come on,
let's go back to school.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.855
Are you feeling okay, Dakota?

05:22.955 --> 05:24.123
- I can't go back to school

05:24.190 --> 05:26.326
until I commit
a crime so heinous

05:26.392 --> 05:27.660
that my mom disowns me.

05:27.727 --> 05:28.895
- I thought that was you guys.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.730
Hop in, you crazy rascals.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.065
- No way.
- No?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.833
- He's known to us.
- This is perfect.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.736
He's creepy,
but he's a familiar face.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.237
This is cool.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.239
I've never hitchhiked before.
- You still haven't.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.709
I was sitting in the same seat
two hours ago.

05:42.809 --> 05:43.976
- Yeah, but now
we're hitchhiking.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.044
I mean, once your thumb is up,

05:45.144 --> 05:46.346
it's against the law.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.814
- What are you guys
arguing about?

05:47.880 --> 05:49.916
I hear you talking
about thumbing things.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.051
I'm nervous.
- Oh, we skipped school,

05:52.151 --> 05:53.886
and now we just
tooling around town.

05:53.986 --> 05:56.756
- Ooh, I like that.
You're pulling a Bueller!

05:56.856 --> 05:58.324
- A what?
- All right, I wanna help.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.492
- Let's just go back to school.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.094
- Sorry, for nostalgic reasons,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.996
I need to facilitate
any Bueller-related activities.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.165
Strap in, kids!
- Whoo!

06:06.232 --> 06:07.934
<i>- Oh, no, don't turn around.
What are you doing?</i>

06:08.034 --> 06:09.502
- I have to.
- Stop, stop.

06:09.569 --> 06:10.903
<i>- Back it up right now.</i>

06:11.003 --> 06:12.271
<i>Okay, over shot it
a little bit.</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:13.506
<i>That's bad.</i>

06:13.573 --> 06:15.108
<i>Now I'm gonna gun it forward.</i>

06:15.208 --> 06:16.209
<i>And we are off!</i>

06:16.275 --> 06:17.710
- You should not
be a bus driver.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.112
- I know.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.947
- ...can't see what my hands
are doing, though.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.949
- Um, sub?
- I have a name.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.418
My name is Mr. Shifrin.
I've said that repeatedly.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.454
- Yeah, okay,
so my friend, Dakota,

06:28.554 --> 06:31.791
she's been gone for,
like, a really long time.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.126
Can I go
check the halls for her?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.895
- No, you cannot
go check the halls.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.196
I've got this.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.399
The only kids missing
are Hank and Irv,

06:39.465 --> 06:42.635
but they had simultaneous
chiropractor appointments.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.970
- Are you an idiot?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.938
- Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

06:46.038 --> 06:50.076
- Kids haven't had names
like that for, like, 50 years.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.746
- Oh, God, no.
Oh, come on, Kevin.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.915
Get your shit together!

06:55.982 --> 06:58.284
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.419
- Can I go?

06:59.485 --> 07:00.653
- Okay, kids.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.321
I am taking you
to the sketchiest,

07:02.422 --> 07:04.791
sleaziest strip mall
in the tri-state area.

07:04.891 --> 07:05.825
- Cool.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.427
- They had a pack of wild rats

07:07.493 --> 07:10.296
living in one of the pretzel
stores for a long time.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.165
- No, this sounds dangerous.
My mom doesn't like me

07:12.265 --> 07:13.266
hanging around with wild rats.

07:13.332 --> 07:14.333
- I mean, as a kid,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.502
I got in so much trouble here

07:16.602 --> 07:17.670
for doing doughnuts,

07:17.770 --> 07:18.938
giving rim jobs.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.673
A cop pepper-sprayed me.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.775
All kinds of fun kid stuff.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.744
- Ah, I love it.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.847
- Oh, come on, man.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.816
- This is
the sleazy strip mall?

07:31.951 --> 07:34.854
- Well, looks like it's changed
a little from back in the day.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.456
- Where are all the rats?
- Yeah.

07:36.522 --> 07:38.324
You've really played up
the rats too much.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.826
- Well, on the plus side,

07:39.926 --> 07:41.694
we can get a smoothie
and some throw pillows.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.929
Who's with me?

07:42.995 --> 07:44.430
- You know what?
We'll meet you in there.

07:44.497 --> 07:45.832
- Go team.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.201
- Guys, we are so not
meeting him in there.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.469
- What?
- The clock is ticking,

07:49.535 --> 07:50.870
and we need to do
something wrong.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.538
Use your brain, Tom! Think!

07:52.638 --> 07:54.040
What would the janitor do?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.642
- What would the janitor do?

07:56.709 --> 08:00.046
<i>- The world's crazy
so you get crazy.</i>

08:00.146 --> 08:02.181
<i>Get in the trash,
you little rebels.</i>

08:02.281 --> 08:03.616
<i>Why don't you
poop in your hand</i>

08:03.683 --> 08:05.718
<i>and throw it everywhere?</i>

08:05.818 --> 08:08.554
- Let's not do any of that.
- Okay, I have an idea.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.191
What if we steal the bus?

08:12.291 --> 08:14.060
- All right, stop.
- Oh, snap.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.628
- You like it?
- If we drive the bus

08:15.695 --> 08:17.797
even ten feet,
we will be legends.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.565
- Guys, we're not
driving a bus, obviously.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.967
- Oh, come on, man.
You read about

08:21.033 --> 08:22.168
these stories all the time.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.036
"Little kid went on a joyride.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.338
What a little rascal."

08:25.404 --> 08:26.873
- That won't be
the headline here.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.641
It's gonna be
"Tom murders multiple people."

08:28.708 --> 08:30.576
- You gotta be 18
to murder somebody.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.678
If you young, it's a joyride.

08:32.745 --> 08:35.248
- The desk is on fire!
Let it burn!

08:35.348 --> 08:37.650
- Guys, let's bring it down,
all right?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.652
- Eat my shoe, sub!

08:39.719 --> 08:41.754
- That was uncalled for.

08:43.422 --> 08:44.924
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>

08:45.024 --> 08:47.727
- Yes, hi, I need to
report some missing kids.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.262
I am at a school.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.665
<i>I believe the name
is Shady Oaks Elementary.</i>

08:52.732 --> 08:54.000
- Wait a minute, you believe?

08:54.066 --> 08:55.401
- Yeah, I believe--
I think I saw it.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.936
- You don't know
the name of the school?

08:57.036 --> 08:59.238
- I believe its name
is Shady Oaks Elementary.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.108
- Hold on, are you
a substitute teacher?

09:02.208 --> 09:03.609
- Yes, ma'am, I am.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.378
I don't know what that
has to do with anything.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.679
- Sorry to say, sir,

09:06.746 --> 09:08.180
we do not take calls
from substitutes.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.283
It's a state-wide policy.
- Excuse me?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.718
- Well, you're really
unreliable sources,

09:12.785 --> 09:14.787
and you can't
retain information.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.455
- I'm a grown, mature man,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.591
and I am reporting
some missing children.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.192
- I'm sorry, goodbye.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.062
- Did you just hang up?
Did 911 just hang up on me?

09:24.363 --> 09:25.631
<i>- I don't feel good
about this.</i>

09:25.731 --> 09:27.099
I don't feel good
about this at all.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.701
- Woah, woah, woah.
Keep us steady.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.369
Straighten it out a little bit.
- I'm trying.

09:30.436 --> 09:31.804
<i>I don't have
the upper body strength.</i>

09:31.904 --> 09:33.706
- Oh, my gosh.
Straighten it out, Tom.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.242
- I can't control the vehicle.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.644
- Tom, we are in the grass.
Straighten her out!

09:38.744 --> 09:40.646
- Oh, no, what am I hitting?
What is that sound?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.148
Bushes or people?
- Uh-oh.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.749
Everybody,
head between your knees.

09:43.816 --> 09:45.585
Brace for impact.
We're hitting something.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.154
- Iceberg!

09:50.423 --> 09:53.492
- Guys, we just crashed
into my mom's car.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.996
This is amazing!
- Amazing? This is a disaster.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.166
- I crashed into my mom's car

10:00.266 --> 10:02.234
in a stolen bus

10:02.301 --> 10:05.404
with Tom, of all people,
who she hates.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.340
I can't wait to see
the look on her face.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.308
- I'm so confused right now.
- All right, you know what?

10:09.408 --> 10:10.676
I'm not gonna
stick around for this.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.744
- Guys, what's the point

10:11.811 --> 10:12.845
if I don't get credit for it?

10:12.945 --> 10:14.347
I need her to know it was me.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.848
- You gotta
work this out in therapy.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.183
We outta here.
- Here we go.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.689
- "Please don't be mad.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.257
"We took the bus.

10:25.324 --> 10:26.525
It happens."

10:27.660 --> 10:29.295
Rule number one of bus driving,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.364
never leave the kids
in a running bus.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.499
They steal it every time.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.303
- Okay, we're about
to become legends.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.038
- They're gonna talk
about us for generations.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.441
We are the kids
who stole the bus.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.710
- Woah, guys, look.
- Oh, my God.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.445
- There's cops,
there's teachers.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.514
This is amazing.
We're gonna be on the news.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.216
- Just tell them
it was all your idea.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.984
Tom really was a bystander.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.819
- I know what I'm gonna say,
I'm ready.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.723
Okay, you got me.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.859
- "You got me"?
That was your big zinger?

10:59.959 --> 11:03.062
- Uh, hello? Criminal here.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.830
- Oh, my God, Dakota.
there you are.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.232
You've missed, like, so much.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.167
The sub is, like,
totally losing it.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.169
He was slapping himself
and just, like, freaking out

11:10.236 --> 11:11.337
and was like,
"No one respects me!"

11:11.404 --> 11:12.705
And now he's, uh, threatening

11:12.805 --> 11:14.507
to jump off the building.
- I'll do it!

11:14.573 --> 11:16.676
Maybe you'll appreciate me
when I'm gone!

11:16.742 --> 11:18.711
How do you find
a sub for a sub?

11:18.811 --> 11:20.246
It can't be done!

11:20.346 --> 11:22.748
- Sir, to be honest,
I don't know your name,

11:22.848 --> 11:24.650
but we value you
at this school.

11:24.717 --> 11:27.420
- Oh, please!
No one respects me!

11:27.520 --> 11:30.489
- I respect you.
- Here, we'll do a little test!

11:30.556 --> 11:32.258
Let's hear a round of applause

11:32.358 --> 11:35.061
from everyone here
that respects me!

11:37.029 --> 11:38.097
Crickets!

11:38.197 --> 11:39.598
That kid right there,
he told me

11:39.699 --> 11:42.001
he had an appointment
for a chiropractor

11:42.068 --> 11:45.171
so he could skip school
and I believed him.

11:45.237 --> 11:48.040
- He skipped school?
- How clueless am I?

11:48.107 --> 11:49.075
Goodbye, world!

11:49.175 --> 11:51.277
Ah! Oof.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.112
What kind of idiot
lands in a bush?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.448
- Wow, that was
so anticlimactic.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.383
- Tom, skipping school?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.085
That's not okay.
- I'm sorry.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.286
- Hey, you wanna use
the handcuffs?

12:00.386 --> 12:01.854
- Yes, handcuffs!
- What?

12:01.921 --> 12:03.289
- All right, come here,
you little son of a bitch.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.390
- What? No, get off.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.791
- Here we go. Oh, don't resist.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.127
- I literally left school
for 45 minutes.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.628
- What about me?
You don't wanna cuff me?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.431
I stole a bus,
and I almost stole some tacos.

12:12.531 --> 12:13.766
- Oh, that's funny, Dakota.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.801
You're so responsible,
often I think

12:15.901 --> 12:17.036
you should be the principal.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.138
- Okay, let's go.
Downtown, buddy.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.773
- You know what?
This whole persona

12:20.873 --> 12:22.975
is just not
getting any traction.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.877
- Look, it's
a running bus right here.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.245
If nobody's gonna question it,

12:26.312 --> 12:27.913
we should take it
for another spin, right?

12:27.980 --> 12:29.548
- You know, I feel like
you're the only one

12:29.615 --> 12:30.950
who gets it at this school.
