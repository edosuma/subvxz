10:14.765 --> 10:16.531
- Thank you.
- So really good luck.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.801
And now, here's question
number two for 20 points.

10:19.870 --> 10:23.238
Earlier in the film,
harry looked out of the window

10:23.307 --> 10:25.907
of a café
in the london underground

10:25.976 --> 10:30.345
and saw dumbledore in front
of an ad for a perfume.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.216
Was it a, dark magic,

10:35.285 --> 10:38.186
b, divine magic,

10:38.255 --> 10:40.989
c, black magic,

10:41.058 --> 10:43.925
or d, eternal magic?

10:43.994 --> 10:45.527
- Dark magic and black magic

10:45.595 --> 10:47.429
doesn't seem
to fit dumbledore scenes.

10:47.497 --> 10:49.230
I feel like that's setting
a weird tone.

10:49.299 --> 10:51.499
- And what kind of perfume
lasts forever?

10:51.568 --> 10:53.818
- Do we feel pretty good
about b?

10:53.904 --> 10:58.506
- I think so.
- Let's see if you're right.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.292
You are correct.
Well done.

11:01.378 --> 11:03.995
[cheers and applause]

11:04.081 --> 11:05.613
and now, this third question

11:05.666 --> 11:08.750
is going to all
of your housemates out there.

11:08.819 --> 11:10.218
So here's the question.

11:10.286 --> 11:12.487
Later in
"the half-blood prince,"

11:12.556 --> 11:16.257
ron tried out for
the gryffindor quidditch team.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.901
A, four, b, five,

11:26.970 --> 11:30.071
c, six, or d, seven?

11:30.140 --> 11:32.974
<i> [suspenseful music]</i>

11:33.026 --> 11:36.578
lock in your answers.

11:36.646 --> 11:40.615
The votes are in,
and their top answer was b.

11:40.684 --> 11:43.084
And that is incorrect, house.
[audience groaning]

11:43.153 --> 11:46.004
the answer is c, six.

11:46.089 --> 11:50.225
So where do our houses
stand in this wild card round?

11:50.293 --> 11:51.359
Luke youngblood.

11:51.428 --> 11:52.694
[cheers and applause]

11:52.763 --> 11:56.164
- we have slytherin
on 30 points

11:56.216 --> 11:59.050
and gryffindor on 60!

11:59.136 --> 12:02.470
[cheers and applause]

12:03.774 --> 12:07.308
- thank you, luke.
Now, it's time for round two.

12:07.377 --> 12:11.546
We all know this round
as the dueling club.

12:11.615 --> 12:13.364
[cheers and applause]

12:13.450 --> 12:17.619
so the questions are now
worth ten, 30, and 50 points.

12:17.687 --> 12:21.456
And, teams, you're going to
take turns aiming each question

12:21.524 --> 12:23.992
at a single player
on the opposing team.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.828
The 50-point question
is of course the toughest,

12:26.880 --> 12:29.164
so you'll want
to be strategic

12:29.232 --> 12:31.666
about who you send
that one over to.

12:31.735 --> 12:34.803
Your houses will be playing
along with each question

12:34.871 --> 12:38.406
so they can potentially
add points to your score.

12:38.475 --> 12:41.342
Slytherin, the first
question about gryffindor

12:41.411 --> 12:42.977
is worth ten points.

12:43.046 --> 12:45.647
Who do you want
to fire it at and why?

12:45.715 --> 12:49.617
- So I feel like trey really
marinates in the information,

12:49.686 --> 12:51.319
and that feels dangerous to me.
[laughter]

12:51.388 --> 12:53.288
- he could be the real threat
on that team.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.956
- Trey,

12:55.025 --> 12:57.358
the slytherins clearly think
that you're a major threat.

12:57.427 --> 12:59.027
Are they right?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.278
[audience oohs]

13:00.363 --> 13:03.364
- question is this.

13:03.433 --> 13:05.767
While seated
with his fellow gryffindors

13:05.836 --> 13:07.535
in "the chamber of secrets"
film,

13:07.604 --> 13:10.705
ron received a howler
from his mother.

13:17.481 --> 13:20.782
A, "how dare you
steal that car!"

13:20.851 --> 13:21.716
[laughter]

13:21.768 --> 13:24.886
b, "I'm absolutely disgusted!"

13:24.955 --> 13:26.020
[laughter]

13:26.089 --> 13:29.357
c, "what were you thinking?"

13:29.425 --> 13:32.894
or d, "we'll bring you
straight home!"

13:32.963 --> 13:34.529
[cheers and applause]

13:34.598 --> 13:37.398
lock in your answers.
Okay.

13:37.467 --> 13:39.467
Trey, what did you say?

13:39.536 --> 13:40.802
- "what were you thinking"

13:40.871 --> 13:42.036
sounds like something
my mom would say.

13:42.105 --> 13:43.288
[laughter]

13:43.373 --> 13:46.541
so I'm confidently
gonna go with

13:46.610 --> 13:49.828
c, "what were you thinking?"

13:49.913 --> 13:52.297
- trey, you just won ten points
for your house.

13:52.382 --> 13:55.316
Well done.
[cheers and applause]

13:55.385 --> 13:58.353
let's see
how your housemates did.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.306
And they were
also correct with c,

14:01.391 --> 14:03.925
so another ten points
for gryffindor.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.977
Now, control swings
back to you, gryffindor.

14:06.062 --> 14:09.397
This question about slytherin
is worth ten points.

14:09.466 --> 14:12.466
Who do you want to answer
your question and why?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.902
- Well, ms. Michelle said

14:13.970 --> 14:15.970
that she's very fond
of reading all the books.

14:16.039 --> 14:18.273
So I think that she has
a plethora of knowledge.

14:18.341 --> 14:20.742
- And to me,
she seems quite smart,

14:20.810 --> 14:23.328
so it seems like
she'll retain knowledge.

14:23.413 --> 14:25.513
- Gryffindor are
starting off with you.

14:25.582 --> 14:27.081
Why do you think that is?

14:27.150 --> 14:30.118
- You know, all the things
they said I agree with.

14:30.186 --> 14:31.836
[laughter]

14:31.922 --> 14:34.372
- okay, michelle,
for ten points...

14:42.198 --> 14:45.433
A, it spoke in a quiet whisper,

14:45.502 --> 14:49.270
b, it was
on draco's head backwards,

14:49.339 --> 14:51.222
c, it fell off,

14:51.308 --> 14:52.807
or d,

14:52.876 --> 14:57.645
it made its decision
before touching draco's head.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.548
Lock in your answers.

15:00.617 --> 15:02.984
Well, now, michelle,
what did you think?

15:03.036 --> 15:05.987
- So I can see this moment
playing in my head.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.123
Draco comes swaggering up
to the stool

15:09.192 --> 15:11.525
dripping in slytherin energy.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.894
[laughter]

15:12.963 --> 15:14.362
there's absolutely no way
the sorting hat

15:14.431 --> 15:16.197
would speak in a quiet whisper,

15:16.249 --> 15:19.067
because it knows exactly
where draco's supposed to go.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.869
In fact, it knew exactly where
it was supposed to go

15:21.922 --> 15:24.339
before even
touching draco's head...

15:24.391 --> 15:27.875
- Ah.
- So I'm gonna go with d.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.011
- And in a
very confident manner

15:30.080 --> 15:32.546
and beautifully acted out,
I might say,

15:32.599 --> 15:34.382
the slytherin swagger.

15:34.451 --> 15:35.934
I love the idea.
[laughter]

15:36.019 --> 15:39.153
I'm gonna--I'm gonna do
the slytherin swagger now.

15:39.222 --> 15:42.440
[cheers and applause]

15:44.577 --> 15:48.780
slytherin swagger.
[laughter]

15:48.865 --> 15:54.002
so michelle, let's see
if you are right or wrong.

15:54.070 --> 15:55.536
And you are correct.

15:55.605 --> 15:58.089
Well done, michelle,
for ten points.

15:58.174 --> 16:01.843
[cheers and applause]

16:01.911 --> 16:04.712
so let's see if your house
was correct as well.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.598
Yes, they were.
[cheers and applause]

16:07.684 --> 16:10.118
congratulations.

16:10.186 --> 16:13.187
Now, this question
about gryffindor house

16:13.256 --> 16:14.922
is worth 30 points.

16:14.991 --> 16:17.925
So slytherin,
who do you want to answer it?

16:17.978 --> 16:20.895
- Brittany I think
is very competitive.

16:20.964 --> 16:23.831
So do we agree that brittany
might be the 30-point question?

16:23.900 --> 16:25.166
- I agree.

16:25.235 --> 16:28.703
- Brittany, for 30 points,
here is your question.

16:28.772 --> 16:32.707
As dumbledore announced
in "the prisoner of azkaban,"

16:32.775 --> 16:34.876
former gryffindor hagrid...

16:42.618 --> 16:44.385
[laughter]

16:44.454 --> 16:47.472
a, wilhelmina grubbly-plank,

16:47.557 --> 16:51.025
b, silvanus kettleburn,

16:51.094 --> 16:53.428
c, herbert beery,

16:53.496 --> 16:57.198
or, d, aurora sinistra?

16:57.267 --> 16:59.667
Lock in your answers.

16:59.736 --> 17:01.903
Okay, brittany,
what is your answer?

17:01.971 --> 17:03.838
- Okay, so this is actually
really funny

17:03.907 --> 17:06.174
because "prisoner of azkaban"
is my favorite movie.

17:06.242 --> 17:10.678
I'm gonna go
with herbert beery, c.

17:10.747 --> 17:13.047
- And I'm afraid
you're incorrect there.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.534
It was silvanus kettleburn.
[audience groaning]

17:16.619 --> 17:18.519
let's see how your house did.

17:18.588 --> 17:21.489
Your house got it right.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.093
[cheers and applause]
- thank you, guys. Thank you.

17:25.161 --> 17:27.345
All right, back once more
to you, gryffindor.

17:27.430 --> 17:30.798
This question about slytherin
is worth 30 points.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.216
Who do you want to answer it?

17:32.302 --> 17:35.053
- If you ask me, I mean,
he's an umbridge fan.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.604
- I'm just gonna have
to select him

17:36.673 --> 17:37.805
because of the umbridge-ness.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.041
- Yeah.
[laughter]

17:40.110 --> 17:42.310
- [imitating umbridge] ahem.
[laughter]

17:42.378 --> 17:44.228
- okay, ryan, for 30 points.

17:44.314 --> 17:48.816
As seen on his tomb
in "the goblet of fire" film...

17:54.524 --> 17:59.927
A, 1902, b, 1903,

17:59.996 --> 18:02.730
c, 1904,

18:02.799 --> 18:05.666
or d, 1905?

18:05.718 --> 18:07.051
[audience groaning]

18:07.137 --> 18:09.604
- that is evil. That is evil.
[laughter]

18:09.672 --> 18:11.589
- house, lock in your answers.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.342
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

18:14.410 --> 18:17.211
no pressure, ryan,
but if you get this right,

18:17.280 --> 18:21.682
then you'll bring yourselves
equal with team gryffindor.

18:21.751 --> 18:23.401
- I was afraid of a moment
like this.

18:23.486 --> 18:25.153
[laughter]

18:25.221 --> 18:29.357
I'm gonna go with what I know
about production of the movie,

18:29.425 --> 18:31.826
and they love odd numbers.

18:31.895 --> 18:35.446
Seven horcruxes, three hallows.
- Mm, interesting.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.265
- So I'm going towards b,

18:37.333 --> 18:38.666
and I'm just--
I'm gonna go with that.

18:38.734 --> 18:41.536
- Go with your gut.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.787
Oh!

18:42.872 --> 18:44.672
- The correct answer
is d, ryan.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.574
But you are very right
about the odd numbers.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.743
But let's see
how your house did.

18:48.812 --> 18:50.545
[audience groaning]
- wow.

18:50.613 --> 18:52.763
- Oh, and the house went for a.

18:52.849 --> 18:55.766
Bad luck, slytherin.
[cheers and applause]

18:55.852 --> 18:58.753
well, that was a very exciting
round on both sides.

18:58.822 --> 19:01.055
Now, we're going
to take a quick break.

19:01.124 --> 19:03.925
But when we come back, teams,
we've got more treats for you.

19:03.993 --> 19:05.960
The stars of "harry potter"

19:06.029 --> 19:10.398
reunited with their
hogwarts houses when we return.

19:10.466 --> 19:13.701
[cheers and applause]

19:16.940 --> 19:20.007
[cheers and applause]

19:21.945 --> 19:23.978
- welcome back.

19:24.047 --> 19:26.831
Let's get back
to our dueling club round.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.650
Slytherin, there's only
one gryffindor player

19:29.719 --> 19:31.686
who hasn't played
this round yet.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.255
Sofia, how gryffindor are you?

19:34.323 --> 19:36.791
- I'm pretty sure
I'm as gryffindor as you get.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.927
I have plenty
of determination today.

19:39.996 --> 19:42.463
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]

19:42.515 --> 19:43.998
- now tell us,

19:44.067 --> 19:46.434
why did you save the
50-point question for sofia?

19:46.502 --> 19:48.302
- Well, she is the youngest,

19:48.354 --> 19:50.538
so I think it was just
more of a strategic move.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.473
- Now, do you think you've got
the same amount of knowledge

19:52.542 --> 19:54.942
as some of the grown-ups
that you are surrounded by?

19:55.011 --> 19:57.344
- I guess my argument
is that I'm the youngest.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.713
My mind is the sharpest.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.449
[oohs and laughter]

20:02.986 --> 20:05.353
- and who better to pose
that question

20:05.421 --> 20:08.389
than one of gryffindor's
best-known house alums?

20:08.458 --> 20:12.360
Please welcome an actor who
rose to the occasion

20:12.428 --> 20:16.414
playing neville longbottom,
matthew lewis.

20:16.499 --> 20:17.798
[cheers and applause]

20:17.867 --> 20:20.101
<i> - hello again, everyone.</i>
- Hello, matthew.

20:20.169 --> 20:22.136
<i> - You've done your house</i>
<i> proud so far, team.</i>

20:22.205 --> 20:26.140
Let's keep it going.
Here's your 50-point question.

20:26.209 --> 20:28.042
When harry joined
the gryffindor quidditch team

20:28.111 --> 20:29.744
in his first year at hogwarts,

20:29.812 --> 20:33.781
<i> he was the school's</i>
<i> youngest seeker in a century.</i>

20:37.987 --> 20:40.521
<i> A, one, b, two,</i>

20:40.590 --> 20:44.125
c, three, or d, four?

20:44.193 --> 20:48.396
- I remember angelina johnson
as a player.

20:48.464 --> 20:52.733
Also katie bell I think
was a player at that time.

20:52.802 --> 20:57.672
So I'm going to say b, two.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.257
- Well,
let's see if you're right.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.876
- The answer is c, three,
so you missed that one.

21:01.945 --> 21:03.628
[audience groaning]

21:03.713 --> 21:05.630
good luck
with the rest of the game.

21:05.715 --> 21:07.014
- Well, that was tough.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.817
Let's see how
your housemates did.

21:09.886 --> 21:14.322
And they all said b as well.

21:14.390 --> 21:16.791
Unfortunately,
no points for gryffindor.

23:02.432 --> 23:06.400

24:07.447 --> 24:09.663
Which game would you like
to start off with?

24:09.732 --> 24:11.866
- My thought is

24:11.934 --> 24:15.970
that trey said he listens
to the films every morning.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.705
- Mm.
- Yeah.

24:17.773 --> 24:19.540
- And he's not watching, which
means his ability to detect...

24:19.609 --> 24:20.608
- To hear.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.576
- By sound might be
really good.

24:22.645 --> 24:24.044
- Mm.

24:24.113 --> 24:25.479
- I don't think
we should give them obscuro.

24:25.548 --> 24:26.947
- Yeah, okay.

24:27.016 --> 24:30.167
- The obscuro charm puts a
blindfold over someone's eyes,

24:30.253 --> 24:34.188
so for us, this game
is all about what you can hear,

24:34.257 --> 24:36.056

24:36.125 --> 24:39.093
Now, listen.
