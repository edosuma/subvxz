38:47.993 --> 38:49.494
I wanna rip her in half.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.530

38:53.197 --> 38:55.567
Oh, how the mighty
have fallen.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.335
Are we stripping him
for parts?

38:58.337 --> 38:59.804
I need you to
look at something.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.875
It's a Telepresence Chip.
He's wired.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.244
Somebody in Zalem
is riding him.

39:08.246 --> 39:11.480
There are watchers behind
the eyes all over the city.

39:11.482 --> 39:12.648
Pretty common now.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.253
I'd just as soon remove it...

39:14.853 --> 39:16.286
while I'm rebuilding him.

39:16.288 --> 39:17.485
VECTOR:
Why are you wasting time

39:17.487 --> 39:19.556
on this burnt-out
street junk?

39:19.558 --> 39:20.956
CHIREN:
It's a personal matter.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.761
GREWISHKA: (IN DIFFERENT TONE)
Do you like your job, Vector?

39:24.661 --> 39:26.496
If you like your position

39:26.498 --> 39:28.663
and the many comforts
that come with it...

39:28.665 --> 39:32.803
I strongly suggest
you listen to Dr. Chiren.

39:34.839 --> 39:35.907
Nova.

39:37.241 --> 39:38.609
My apologies.

39:39.342 --> 39:42.045
Who did this to Grewishka?

39:42.047 --> 39:43.782
A little cyborg girl.

39:44.616 --> 39:45.748
Though the impact points

39:45.750 --> 39:47.652
are evidence
of extraordinary power...

39:49.386 --> 39:51.020
I don't understand
how she could create

39:51.022 --> 39:53.655
such force
with such a small body.

39:53.657 --> 39:57.259
It was not the power
of the body that did this.

39:57.261 --> 39:58.360
It was the mind.

39:58.362 --> 40:02.732
She knows the fighting
techniques of Panzer Kunst.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.632
Rebuild Grewishka.

40:04.634 --> 40:06.837
Have him bring her to me.

your goal at any cost.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.766

You'll send me to Zalem?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.971
There is no bounty
on Grewishka.

41:16.973 --> 41:19.742
But you reported it
to the Factory.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.476
Him killing
all of those women...

41:21.478 --> 41:23.045
Somebody's protecting him.

41:23.047 --> 41:25.016
Who has the power to do that?

41:27.319 --> 41:29.721
Someone far beyond us here.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.058
We better stay off
the street for now.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.728
I wanna be
a Hunter-Warrior like you.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.230
Alita, that's impossible.

41:40.232 --> 41:41.697
We could be a team.

41:41.699 --> 41:43.532
Alita, this is dangerous,
dirty work.

41:43.534 --> 41:45.335
- I know.
- No, you don't.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.871
How is that
your choice to make?

41:47.605 --> 41:48.737
It's out of the question.

41:48.739 --> 41:50.605
I might need
a life-or-death situation

41:50.607 --> 41:51.907
to remember who I was.

41:51.909 --> 41:54.043
Even if it's just
for a second.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.212
Alita, some things are
better left forgotten.

41:56.214 --> 41:59.148
I don't want blood
on these hands, too.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.052
Then I'll find out
for myself.

Alita.

43:40.418 --> 43:41.416
Right now, I'd say Jashugan

43:41.418 --> 43:43.585
has the best chance
of making Final Champion.

Camber's still off

a Motorball player can win.

player that can't be beaten...

is that no one...

What's outside the city?

48:47.958 --> 48:49.090
HUGO: Not much.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.659
The war
wiped out all utilities

48:50.661 --> 48:52.129
and most everything else.

48:55.766 --> 49:00.235
All we know is the sky cities
fell all in one night...

49:00.237 --> 49:02.404
when the enemy launched
the last attack

49:02.406 --> 49:03.842
with every ship they had.

49:04.875 --> 49:06.343
Who was the enemy?

49:07.011 --> 49:08.878
The URM.

49:08.880 --> 49:12.717
United Republics of Mars.
The U-R-M.

49:13.418 --> 49:14.282
ALITA: URM.

49:14.284 --> 49:16.886
On that last night
of the war...

49:16.888 --> 49:19.554
the earth shook
and the sky burned.

49:19.556 --> 49:22.726
But in the morning,
Zalem still stood.

49:23.261 --> 49:24.695
It's just up ahead.

49:32.536 --> 49:35.271
This ship is from
the battle of Zalem.

49:35.273 --> 49:36.438
I figured that
maybe seeing stuff

49:36.440 --> 49:38.243
from the war would
help trigger your...

49:46.583 --> 49:48.083
Salvagers have jacked
some stuff

49:48.085 --> 49:49.454
over the years for metal...

49:50.087 --> 49:51.387
but it's all URM technology,

49:51.389 --> 49:52.688
so it's mostly been
left alone.

49:52.690 --> 49:55.123
- This is an URM ship?
- HUGO: Uh-huh.

49:55.125 --> 49:56.425
You know, it's pretty hard
to sell this stuff

49:56.427 --> 49:58.393
since no one knows
what it is...

49:58.395 --> 49:59.496
Shh!

50:08.005 --> 50:09.607
We have to go
to the command deck.

50:11.743 --> 50:13.210
It's forward.

50:13.976 --> 50:15.610
How does she know that?

50:15.612 --> 50:18.483
Hey, we can't get there.
It's underwater.

50:51.380 --> 50:53.685
How long do you think
she can hold her breath?

But...

53:13.924 --> 53:16.291
But you have to.

53:16.293 --> 53:17.759
This would help us
fight Grewishka

53:17.761 --> 53:19.897
and anyone else
he sends after us.

53:21.864 --> 53:22.866

53:23.933 --> 53:26.500
it has the power I need.

53:26.502 --> 53:29.605
I feel a connection to it
I can't explain.

53:29.607 --> 53:31.438
This could be who I am.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.875
You've been given
a chance to start over,

53:33.877 --> 53:35.009
with a clean slate.

53:35.011 --> 53:36.344
How many of us get that?

53:36.346 --> 53:38.749
Why did an enemy warship...

53:40.351 --> 53:41.886
respond to me?

53:42.518 --> 53:43.955
Because I knew that ship.

53:44.822 --> 53:47.024
I've been on others like it,
haven't I?

53:48.426 --> 53:49.925
Haven't I?

53:49.927 --> 53:53.094
Ouf, whatever you were,
it's not who you are now.

No!

to do that for me.
