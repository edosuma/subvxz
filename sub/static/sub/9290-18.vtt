00:12.200 --> 00:14.320
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.200
- "Almeida."
- "Tony, it's me. Gael's dead."

00:18.280 --> 00:22.120
He was suffering so badly. No one should
have to go through what he did.

00:22.240 --> 00:26.040
There are children upstairs
who are going to die in agony.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.640
Michelle, unfortunately there's nothing
we can do for them right now.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.200
Actually, there is.

00:32.920 --> 00:36.880
Suicide capsules for
the people down at the hotel.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.920
It's against every regulation in the book.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.240
- Yeah.
- Do it.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.280
Get down!

00:50.560 --> 00:52.080
The Saunders computer file...

00:52.200 --> 00:54.920
- What server did you store it on?
- A-5.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.880
Chase, we got a bomb.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.000
- How much time?
- "None."

01:00.120 --> 01:02.720
I got it! Go! Go!

01:06.080 --> 01:07.440
- Chappelle.
- Ryan, it's Jack.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.120
- Almost the entire Ml-6 office
has just been wiped out.
- What?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.400
One of the things that Saunders
was trying to destroy...

01:13.480 --> 01:15.680
was all the information
that Ml-6 had gathered on him.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.240
I managed to retrieve the hard drive.
Have you got anything yet?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.120
I'm trying to follow the money trail.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.800
- What do you want?
- To give you your next assignment.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.400
There's a man named Ryan Chappelle.
Regional Director of C. T.U.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.280
- I want him killed.
- It's out of the question.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.960
Before you decide, you might want to
drop by the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.800
Take a good look at what's happening.
Then imagine the same event...

01:36.920 --> 01:39.280
taking place at hundreds of
locations all over the country.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.960
You're insane.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.560
The following takes place
between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.960
This office isn't above the law.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.680
How can I justify authorizing
the murder of an innocent man?

01:56.800 --> 02:00.080
David, we're fighting a war.
Ryan Chappelle is not a civilian.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.320
I still can't order him to be killed.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.479
So what's the alternative?
Yes, David, I know. It's extreme.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.880
I realize that. But it's
the only move we have here.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.640
Look at what's happening
right now at the Chandler Plaza.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.480
This man Saunders has proven that he will use
this virus to inflict mass casualties...

02:18.600 --> 02:21.280
if you don't do what he says.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.040
How long am I supposed to
let Saunders dictate my actions?

02:24.120 --> 02:27.080
How long do I allow him
to hold this country hostage?

02:27.200 --> 02:28.920
- Until we catch him.
- And what if we don't?

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
We will. But until we do,
your only option is to sacrifice Chappelle.

02:43.880 --> 02:48.160
I handed the hard drive from Ml-6 to the I.T.
Lab. They're sorting through the data now.

02:48.280 --> 02:53.040
- London wants you to debrief them
on what went down with Ml-6.
- Any closer to finding Saunders?

02:53.120 --> 02:55.880
He's using a scrambler phone to contact
the president. Adam says it can...

02:55.960 --> 02:58.360
take up to 24 hours to trace his location.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.840
That's the only search
protocol we've got going?

03:00.920 --> 03:03.760
Saunders transferred money to Amador using
a server somewhere in Los Angeles.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.840
I'm trying to follow Amador's money trail
to see if it leads back to Saunders.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.880
- But you haven't turned up anything yet?
- "No."

03:09.040 --> 03:12.440
The computer we confiscated from
the go club in Chinatown is a dead end.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.920
- I'm trying to backtrace payments
to offshore accounts.
- Okay, fine.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.320
- Jack, the president's office is holding for you.
- Transfer the call down here.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.840
He asked to speak to you in private.
He's on the line in station seven.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.920
Excuse me.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.520
- This is Bauer.
- Agent Bauer, please hold for the president.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.040
Mr. President,
I have Jack Bauer for you.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.680
- Jack.
- Mr. President.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.240
- Are you alone right now?
- Yes, sir.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.800
Saunders called me a few minutes ago.
He's made another demand.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.760
What is it?

03:56.880 --> 04:00.560
This is a hard one, Jack.
So I'm going to be as direct as I can be.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.080
He wants Ryan Chappelle dead.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.040
I-I'm sorry. I don't understand.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.080
He wants his body delivered to
the train yard downtown.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.560
Why would Saunders
want Chappelle dead?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.440
I don't know. He wouldn't give me a reason.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.079
But he was emphatic about the consequences
if his demand wasn't met.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.160
Jack, I feel as though
I'm crossing a line...

04:21.240 --> 04:23.760
that I will never
be able to step back from.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.840
So then you've made
your decision, sir?

04:27.640 --> 04:30.160
Unless you can suggest
a way to handle this.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.600
- What time is this supposed to happen?
- 7:00.

04:35.720 --> 04:39.480
- Maybe I can find Saunders before that.
- That's in less than an hour.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.360
- Yes, I know, sir. I should get going.
- Jack...

04:42.440 --> 04:46.040
I'm sorry to put this on you,
but I didn't know who else to call.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.440
I understand, sir. I'll get back to you.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.200
Chloe. What are you doing right now
to help find Saunders?

04:57.320 --> 05:00.800
- Actually, we're relaying our data streams
to Division.
- Why are you sending them there?

05:00.960 --> 05:03.800
They're the hub now. Chappelle has them
gathering information for us... D.O.D., Ml-6.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.960
No. Forget about that. I want you
to mirror everything they're doing...

05:07.040 --> 05:08.960
- and start your search here.
- Okay. What kind of search?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.480
What's the largest base of
knowledge we have on Saunders?

05:11.600 --> 05:13.240
- Financial.
- Okay. Follow the bank trails.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.040
- I'll have to clear it with Chappelle.
- No, you can't do that.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.240
Well, he gave the order.
He outranks you, Jack.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.960
You're gonna do what I ask you, and you're
not gonna let Chappelle know. Got it?

05:22.080 --> 05:25.480
No. I don't got it. He's mad at me for, like,
12 things. I'm not gonna add that to the list.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.720
Chloe! Chloe...

05:28.800 --> 05:32.440
I wouldn't ask you to do it like this
if it wasn't very important.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.880
Okay? So, please, just do this for me.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.120
- Fine.
- Thank you.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.400
Nearly a third of the people in this hotel
are symptomatic, and it's getting worse.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.120
They should have the choice
to end their own lives.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.320
The capsules
should be there soon.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.760
- Tony.
- Yeah?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.760
I realize we've both
been talking around this, but...

06:08.840 --> 06:12.120
if my test comes back positive...

06:12.200 --> 06:14.360
Michelle, don't go there.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.800
Sweetheart, we both know
my chances of survival are low.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.240
You still have a chance,
and while there's still a chance...

06:22.360 --> 06:25.200
- I don't wanna talk about this.
- Okay.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.160
Okay. Just...

06:30.480 --> 06:32.840
No matter what,
I just want you to know...

06:34.320 --> 06:37.240
the last three years have been
the best years of my life.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.960
I should be there with you.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.760
- You are.
- No. It's not the same.

06:53.440 --> 06:57.840
The best thing you can do for me right now
is make sure those capsules get here.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.400
- I'll do my best.
- I know you will.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.440
Tony, I need to speak to you.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.480
- Michelle?
- Yeah.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.600
Did she get her test results back yet?

07:31.720 --> 07:35.360
No, they won't have 'em back
for another hour yet.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.160
- What's going on?
- Do you know if Saunders
and Chappelle had any history?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.520
If their paths had ever crossed?

07:41.600 --> 07:45.840
Not that I'm aware of.
What kind of connection you lookin' for?

07:45.920 --> 07:49.040
The kind that would make
Saunders want Chappelle killed.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.880
'Cause that's exactly
what he just ordered the president to do.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.920
By 7:00 a.m.,
he wants Ryan Chappelle dead.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.800
- Why?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.440
And the president put this on you?

08:09.800 --> 08:12.240
I don't know what I'm gonna do if
we don't find Saunders by 7:00.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.160
- Have you told Ryan about this?
- No. Not yet.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.520
Well, I should probably change
his security clearance before you do.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.760
- You really think he's a flight risk?
- We can't take the chance.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.800
We have to find Saunders. I'll get Chappelle
to send all his data over to Chloe.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.040
Prep her and whoever else
you can spare to sort through it.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.919
- They're gonna wanna know what's going on.
- They don't need to know.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.840
I'll take care of it.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.760
Thank you.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.440
- Field Ops. O'Brian.
- Chloe.

08:40.559 --> 08:43.240
- Yeah.
- Put all your protocols on hold for the next hour.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.600
Got it.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.520
- Okay.
- All right.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.200
What did the president
want to talk to you about?

08:50.320 --> 08:54.520
- You.
- Me? What about me?

08:54.640 --> 08:56.440
Ryan, come with me.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.240
Just take a seat.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.400
What's going on here, Jack?

09:09.480 --> 09:13.240
- Saunders called in with another demand.
- What does he want now?

09:16.160 --> 09:20.160
- Jack.
- He wants you killed.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.200
- This is some kind of a joke?
- It's no joke, Ryan.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.720
He's threatened to release
the virus into the main population...

09:29.840 --> 09:32.200
unless we deliver your body by 7:00 a.m.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.000
Did Palmer actually go along with this?

09:38.280 --> 09:41.160
- My God! Jack!
- He's proven he'll use the virus.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.280
- The president had no choice.
- So he sent you to kill me?

09:44.400 --> 09:47.680
- Not if we can find Saunders by 7:00 a.m.
- Ah, great.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.240
That gives us a lot of time, doesn't it?

09:51.600 --> 09:53.560
I-I don't understand this. Why me?

09:53.680 --> 09:56.960
We don't know.
Ryan, I need you to think real hard.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.200
Do you have any past connection
with Saunders we don't know about?

09:59.320 --> 10:03.240
No! The first time I heard the name
Stephen Saunders was today.

10:03.360 --> 10:07.480
The money transactions that you've been
investigating. That's what triggered this.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.680
- I haven't had a chance to trace them to Saunders.
- The fact he wants you dead...

10:10.760 --> 10:12.920
proves that they lead back to him.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.320
And you expect to
figure this out by 7:00?

10:15.400 --> 10:18.280
Finding Saunders in time
is the only way to keep you alive.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.000
And I will use everything
at my disposal to do that.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.920
Ryan, I need your help.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.960
I need all your files... and I mean everything...
sent over to Chloe's desk...

10:29.120 --> 10:31.480
so she can start going through it.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.800
I'm sorry, Ryan.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.240
Let's find this guy.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.640
- What have you got?
- I found Saunders's offshore
bank account in the Caymans.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.920
I was able to access his account information
off their network, but it's encrypted.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.040
- Another brick wall.
- Just send it over to Chloe's desk.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.600
- If anyone can break the encryption, she can.
- Not in the time we have.

11:33.720 --> 11:38.080
- You don't know that, Ryan.
- It has to be now, Jack, now. This is it!

11:38.200 --> 11:40.880
Don't you understand?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.680
Oh. Of course you understand.
You're the one who's going to kill me.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.120
We're doing everything we can.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.000
Don't you realize the possibility that this
might not even be relevant?

11:52.680 --> 11:55.880
Saunders knows if he kills me
it doesn't kill the investigation.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.000
He might want me dead
for something else I know.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.040
- Something I haven't made a connection with yet.
- Then think, Ryan, think!

12:01.200 --> 12:03.440
But don't give in to this bastard.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.160
With all of us working together,
we're gonna find this guy, okay?

12:09.080 --> 12:12.680
Send the encrypted account over to
Chloe's desk. I'll explain it to her. Come on.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.560
Chloe, Ryan's forwarding a file to you.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.160
You'll be all right, sweetheart.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.240
They don't know.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.360
Don't worry. I got you.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.360
Please, let me...
let me call my wife.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.480
I'm sorry. We're still under orders
to keep what's going on secret...

12:53.600 --> 12:56.120
- so we don't create a panic.
- Yeah. I won't tell her anything.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.080
Your people can listen in.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.560
That order comes
directly from the president.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.600
I have done everything
I can do to help you. Please?

13:09.240 --> 13:12.720
I just wanna... I just wanna hear
her voice, please.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.280
- I'm sorry.
- Sir?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.400
I'm-I'm so sorry.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.600
There you go.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.880
Can I have your attention, please?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.240
What I'm about to tell you
will be difficult to hear...

13:41.400 --> 13:44.240
but it's important that
you have all the information...

13:44.320 --> 13:47.000
so you can each make
your own decision.

13:48.960 --> 13:53.240
First, I want all of you to know that...

13:53.360 --> 13:56.800
once symptoms of infection appear...

13:56.960 --> 13:59.720
there is no chance of recovery.

14:01.600 --> 14:06.840
As the virus progresses, it attacks
the body's organs and major blood vessels.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.960
This process is extremely painful.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.440
The estimated time of death
is within six hours.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.880
I'm telling you all of this as directly as possible...

14:18.000 --> 14:22.400
because we can offer
each of you an alternative.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.800
Some pills that you can take...

14:24.880 --> 14:28.720
that will basically make you
feel like you're going to sleep.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.080
It will be up to
each one of you to decide when...

14:36.160 --> 14:40.280
and if you want to use these drugs.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.280
They will be available shortly.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.160
Thank you.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.320
Michelle, we have a situation.
A woman came forward to tell us...

14:55.440 --> 14:57.240
she can't find
the man she was here with.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.240
She hasn't seen him for a few hours.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.160
- Are you sure he's not in isolation?
- Yeah. We let her look.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.640
- What's his name?
- That's part of the problem.
She claims she doesn't know.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.040
- I'm Agent Michelle Dessler.
- I'm Kathy. Kathy McCartney.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.840
You realize how important it is that we account
for everyone who may have been infected?

15:16.920 --> 15:20.360
- Yes. That's why I came forward.
- We need you to be completely honest.

15:20.480 --> 15:25.040
I am. All I know is that his name is Bill,
and I'm not even sure if that's real.

15:25.160 --> 15:30.360
- What do you mean?
- We met tonight at a club on Hill.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.120
And we really connected,
so we decided to come here.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.600
- Who booked the room?
- I did.

15:36.680 --> 15:40.000
- Do you remember the last time you saw him?
- We fell asleep together...

15:40.120 --> 15:43.240
in the room, and when the fire alarm
woke me up, he was gone.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.640
Do you remember
what time you fell asleep?

15:45.760 --> 15:49.880
I know exactly.
I looked at the clock. It was 4:02.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.920
Stay here, please.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.480
Sunny, if she's right
about the time...

15:55.600 --> 15:58.480
then this man was in the hotel
when the virus was released...

15:58.560 --> 16:01.560
and he got out of the building before
it was completely locked down.

16:01.680 --> 16:05.160
- Is it possible he's hiding somewhere in the hotel?
- No. No.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.000
We've accounted for everyone in
the guest rooms...

16:07.120 --> 16:10.360
and we've done an infrared
sweep of all the public areas.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.720
Ed, get a forensic table
to her room. Dust for prints.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.200
- There'll be dozens of people's prints in there.
- Just do it.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.320
This is Agent Miller.
We need a forensic team right now.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.520
- Kathy, I need you to come with me.
- Why?

16:21.680 --> 16:25.320
You need to show me every surface
that Bill may have touched. Come on.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.840
Thanks.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.960
Chloe needs as much
processing power as she can get.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.920
I need you to open up
another sock in the network for her.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.880
How's he doing?

16:41.040 --> 16:43.760
- He's scared.
- All right. Chase has a strike team assembled.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.000
They're ready to go as soon as we get
a location on Saunders.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.560
I ordered you a helicopter from Air Tactical.
Train yard's all the way across town.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.600
- We can't afford to be slowed
down by rush-hour traffic.
- Okay, good.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.640
- I'll get the socket open for Chloe.
- Thanks a lot.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.640
Jack, the bank used deep encryption.
We're gonna have to use a password crack.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.600
- How long is that gonna take?
- As long as 90 minutes.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.560
- We don't have that much time.
- I'm doing the best I can. Maybe it would help...

17:03.680 --> 17:05.560
if you told us why this is overriding
our other protocols.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.079
The only thing you need to know is I need
these files decrypted now.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.319
I'm doing my very best. Your tone
of voice is not exactly a morale booster.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.800
Chloe, please, just do it.

17:15.359 --> 17:18.400
- Here, let me help. We can parallel process.
- Okay. Good idea.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.760
Send it to my station.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.920
Ryan.

17:37.480 --> 17:41.240
Copy that. He's outside now.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.080
I'm sorry, Mr. Chappelle.
We're not allowed to let you leave.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.840
- What?
- Please return to C.T.U., sir.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.440
- Who the hell...
- We have orders.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.720
From who? I'm Regional Director.
I countermand any order you've been given.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.600
- Ryan.
- What the hell's going on here, Jack?

17:55.680 --> 17:59.120
Why aren't I being allowed to
leave the building?

17:59.240 --> 18:02.600
You think I'm trying to run?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.760
I'm going outside
to smoke a cigarette.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.880
I wouldn't condemn millions of people
to death so I could live.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.160
Let me see the cigarettes.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.400
These men will escort you back to holding.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.720
- I don't think so.
- I'm not asking, Ryan.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.040
Under the authority given to me by
the president of the United States...

18:25.120 --> 18:27.080
I am ordering you.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.240
Tony, it's me. We have a problem.

19:02.360 --> 19:05.920
We just determined a man who was exposed
to the virus got out of the hotel.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.920
Son of a bitch. How'd that happen?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.520
He must have slipped out right before we
reinforced the perimeter.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.280
- It's likely he had no idea he'd been exposed.
- You notified Health Services?

19:14.400 --> 19:17.480
Yeah. They're aware of the situation.
The problem is we don't know who he is.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.840
- He wasn't a registered guest.
- What was he doing inside the hotel?

19:20.960 --> 19:24.920
Having a one-night stand.
The woman he was with came forward.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.880
- Any sign of him on the surveillance cameras?
- Nothing at the front desk.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.600
No one seems to have seen him come or go.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.560
- What are we doing to find him?
- Our best shot to I.D. Him is off prints.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.200
We've already pulled dozens from
all the obvious surfaces, light switches...

19:36.320 --> 19:38.680
- "bathroom fixtures."
- Look, send the prints over to us.

19:38.760 --> 19:42.000
- We'll work 'em up.
See what else you can find off this woman.
- Got it.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.320
- That's all I can remember.
- Okay.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
- I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
- No, you're doing great.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.720
Let's go over this one more time.
The two of you came into the room.

19:51.840 --> 19:56.360
Uh, I had the key, so I'm the one
who opened the door.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.160
We didn't turn the lights on or off.

19:59.240 --> 20:03.040
- Did he go over to the window, draw the blinds?
- No. We just started kissing.

20:03.160 --> 20:07.880
- Where were you standing?
- Um, I was here by the bed.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.720
- And then what happened?
- He started taking my clothes off.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.640
- The clothes you're wearing now?
- Yeah.

20:13.720 --> 20:17.520
He pulled my shirt over my head
and then my pants. And then...

20:17.640 --> 20:19.200
I need your belt.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.440
Miller, try the buckle.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.800
Couple of prints
look like hers.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.040
- Hold it. I got a partial thumb.
- It's not hers?

20:42.160 --> 20:44.560
Checking.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.920
No. She's got inverse swirls.
This print doesn't.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.080
Upload it to C.T.U. Now.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.000
If we don't find this guy before he becomes
symptomatic, we might be looking at an outbreak.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.960
Where've you been?

21:20.080 --> 21:25.320
I had a client meeting. I told you that
I wouldn't come home if it went too late.

21:25.440 --> 21:29.400
Oh, that's right. Kind of wish
you would've called. I was worried.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.920
I didn't want to wake you up.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.560
Jack, I think I'm getting something.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.040
Applying the last layer of keywords.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.160
It worked. We cracked the decryption.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.520
We have access to
Saunders's bank account.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.520
Go into the header.
Tell me what address they've got on him.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.160
There's several across the country.
One in Los Angeles.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.000
An apartment downtown.
Five minutes from here.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.840
- How do we know the address is real?
- Every time the money is moved...

22:07.960 --> 22:10.160
the bank confirms the physical location
of that call.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.960
Saunders called in a transfer
45 minutes ago from that address.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.800
- All right. I'll call Chase.
- Tell him not to go in hard.
Saunders can't see us coming.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.080
Good work. Great work.
Thank you.

22:20.360 --> 22:25.240
Open it. Ryan,
I think we found Saunders.

22:25.400 --> 22:29.160
- Through his bank account?
- Yeah, 45 minutes ago,
he made a call not far from here.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.280
Chase is leading a strike team
over there now.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.360
Good, Jack. Thank God.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.720
- Ryan, we still need to go over to the train yard.
- Now?

22:39.840 --> 22:43.040
- What are you talking about?
- We have to be in place before the deadline.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.840
- Just in case the strike team isn't successful.
- But you said...

22:45.920 --> 22:49.360
- they know he was there 45 minutes ago.
- Ryan, this is a precaution.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.640
We have to do it until we have him
in custody. You know that.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.560
I've got a helicopter waiting for us
over in the north annex.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.800
- We should go now.
- All right, Jack.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.440
Okay.

23:11.840 --> 23:15.040
- We'll be in touch as soon as we're airborne.
- All right.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.160
Mr. Chappelle, Division called to confirm
your 3:00 briefing. Is that still good?

23:20.280 --> 23:22.520
Sure.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.200
Mr. President...

23:40.280 --> 23:43.440
Helen Stupin from the "L.A. Times"
just called my office.

23:43.560 --> 23:48.280
She was asking about some kind of toxic
accident at the Chandler Plaza Hotel...

23:48.400 --> 23:51.440
- and if it was connected to the red alert.
- What exactly did she say?

23:51.560 --> 23:53.400
Not much. She was fishing.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.680
Mr. President, I appreciate that you need
to keep certain things from me...

24:00.800 --> 24:03.240
but this story will get out,
and when it does, I'll need to have answers.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.800
Jerry's right, David.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.840
Now the sooner we bring him into the loop,
the better he can handle the press.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.480
A weaponized virus was released
into that hotel's ventilation system.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.320
Oh, my God.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.320
When will you go public with this?

24:30.480 --> 24:34.000
Once we're sure that the virus has been
contained and there's no longer a threat.

24:34.160 --> 24:36.360
And how certain are you
that it will be contained?

24:36.480 --> 24:39.400
We're doing everything possible.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.240
Yes, sir.

25:01.920 --> 25:06.160
Jack! Tony said you're not coming
with me to get Saunders.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.240
That's right. You and Baker
are heading up the strike team.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.040
Wait. I don't understand.
Saunders is the priority.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.120
I've ordered Jack downtown
to answer a few more questions.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.520
You know what, Ryan?
All you do is put obstacles in our way.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.000
We have a chance to get Saunders.
We need our best people.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.720
- "You tie us down with your bureaucratic B.S."
- Chase.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.640
Those are the orders.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.120
What's going on, Jack?

25:35.240 --> 25:37.200
Just take care of the strike team.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.960
Any sign that he's in there?

26:55.040 --> 26:57.440
I can't get a visual inside.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.160
We got three men outside the building.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.680
We can take 'em out with a sniper.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.080
No. We can't do that.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.960
If we miss, Saunders will know we're here.
I wanna do this up close.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.040
The building's out in the open.
They'll see us coming from a block away.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.960
That's why Saunders picked the place.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.560
I don't see how we get to them before
they can warn Saunders.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.480
I do.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.320
They're grounding flights from LAX.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.080
Did all the couriers
get out with their vials?

27:37.200 --> 27:41.120
New York, Washington, San Francisco
made it through. They're on their way.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.440
I rerouted Las Vegas.
Our man is driving there now.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.040
But we missed Chicago and Cleveland.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.280
- Did you revise the casualty projections?
- Of course. Here they...

27:51.360 --> 27:55.520
- Just give me the number.
- Two to five million dead within the first 48 hours.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.800
- Good enough.
- Sir, there is a chance the outbreak will spread...

28:00.880 --> 28:03.240
- beyond the Americas.
- We'll be fine. Don't worry.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.640
Tony, we got results back on
the fingerprint from the hotel.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.040
- What do you got?
- If it had been a complete print...

28:20.160 --> 28:22.920
obviously there'd be only one true match,
but because it's a partial...

28:23.000 --> 28:26.080
we get results from anyone whose fingerprints
match that particular quadrant.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.560
How many potential matches
we talking about?

28:28.680 --> 28:31.680
The F.B.I. Database gave us
almost 300 possibilities.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.320
All right, look. Upload those pictures
to Michelle at the hotel.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.400
- Have that woman go through 'em.
- Okay, I'm on it.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.560
Tony, Ryan Chappelle on line three.

28:48.840 --> 28:51.240
- "Ryan?"
- What's taking Edmunds so long?

28:51.320 --> 28:55.920
- Has he even called in yet?
- He's moving into position
around Saunders's building now.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.640
What are they waiting for?
Why haven't they gone in?

28:58.800 --> 29:01.160
They're preparing a covert entry, Ryan.
It takes a little time.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.080
Well, get on 'em, Tony.
Get those men into that building.

29:04.200 --> 29:07.560
Ryan, Chase is running this operation
on the ground. He needs to make this call.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.680
Ryan, Chase knows what's at stake here.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.480
He's gonna go in when it's safe.
Try and relax.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.200
- Ryan, you still there?
- I'm here.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.680
All right. I'm hooking you up
to the real-time comm feed.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.040
Good.

29:20.120 --> 29:24.200
- Tony, I've got a visual on the train yard.
- Copy that.

31:07.080 --> 31:10.360
There's no one in the lobby.
Baker and I are moving up the stairs.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.760
Graves and Martinez
are coming down from the roof.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.240
The guard at the top of
the stairs has been taken out.

31:47.360 --> 31:48.960
We're proceeding down the hall.

32:04.480 --> 32:08.160
We got one man by the door.
We're gonna have to move fast. My lead.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.560
Set.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.480
- " Clear."
- No one's here.

32:48.320 --> 32:51.720
It's a switching node.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.720
He's been relaying calls
from this location... damn it!

33:26.000 --> 33:28.520
- This is Bauer.
- You underestimate me, Jack.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.200
Saunders, why are you doing this?

33:31.320 --> 33:33.320
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.800
Try me.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.280
Tell your people not to
bother tracing that relay.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.560
I've already switched to another node.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.400
- Stephen.
- A van will be arriving shortly.

33:44.480 --> 33:48.400
Leave Chappelle's body with the driver.
Do not attempt to follow the van.

33:50.960 --> 33:55.200
If you don't follow my directions,
I will release the virus immediately.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.320
Can I have everyone's attention, please.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.320
These are the drugs
Agent Dessler told you about earlier.

34:39.440 --> 34:44.520
Anyone who wants to exercise
this option can step forward.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.760
- Michelle.
- Did you find a match?

35:16.920 --> 35:19.000
Partial thumbprint gave us
a few hundred possibles...

35:19.120 --> 35:20.920
which we narrowed down
to a dozen men.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.560
We uploaded the pictures.
Ms. McCartney's looking at 'em now.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.040
That's not him. No.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.440
No.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.200
- This one. I think that's him.
- Are you sure?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.520
Yeah, I'm sure.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.480
Find him.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.680
"Are you okay, William?"

35:51.800 --> 35:53.800
You've been in there for a while.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.760
- Uh, I have some kind of bug.
- Do you want me to make some tea?

35:57.920 --> 36:01.080
No, I'm fine.

36:01.160 --> 36:05.080
- "Are you sure?"
- Yeah. Yeah, I gotta go to the office.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.480
- I have a staff meeting.
- Okay.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.640
- Kaufman.
- This is Jack.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.760
Have you got satellite
coverage on my position now?

36:33.920 --> 36:36.480
- Not yet, but I'll reposition.
- There's a black van. No plates.

36:36.600 --> 36:40.120
I'm sure they're gonna use countermeasures,
but do everything you can to follow it.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.520
Okay.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.280
We have to go, Ryan.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.080
My legs are shaking.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.480
I've got ya.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.720
Ryan, is there anyone you wanna talk to?

37:37.840 --> 37:39.480
What do you mean, to say good-bye?

37:39.600 --> 37:43.280
To say whatever you have to.

37:43.360 --> 37:48.440
I have a brother
I haven't spoken to in years.

37:51.520 --> 37:55.400
I don't have that many friends.
Just the people at work.

37:55.520 --> 37:59.360
So, no. There's no one.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.760
I'm sorry, Ryan. We gotta do this.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.240
Get on your knees.

38:14.240 --> 38:18.400
All right, there's no way around this,
right, Jack? We don't have any outs here.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.240
Not that I can see.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.920
Wait.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.400
All right.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.400
Let me do this myself.

38:32.480 --> 38:37.200
At least give me the dignity
of taking my own life.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.160
That's something you can do.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.440
- No, Ryan. I can't do that.
- Yes, you can!

38:43.520 --> 38:45.400
You were right back at C.T.U.
To put me under watch.

38:45.520 --> 38:49.080
I wasn't going out for a cigarette.
I was trying to bolt.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.680
But I know this has to happen.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.520
I can't take that chance.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.480
I'm giving you my word, Jack.

39:01.280 --> 39:04.280
I won't run. I swear.

39:05.880 --> 39:10.240
I-l-I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared.
But I'm not gonna run.

39:10.360 --> 39:15.600
I couldn't live with myself knowing I was
responsible for the deaths of all those people.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.080
You gotta believe me.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.640
I can't. I can't.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.560
It's all right.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.520
I'm sorry we let you down, Ryan.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.760
God forgive me.
