05:24.891 --> 05:26.425
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.060
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.730
Listen...

05:31.732 --> 05:34.966
Thanks for coming over
on such short notice.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.436
It will only take
a moment, I promise.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.939
Have a seat.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.741
Make yourself comfortable.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.711
You want something to drink?
juice, mineral water?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.447
- Water would be great.
- Water it is.

06:14.073 --> 06:17.576
I'm starting to think this case
is never going to get settled.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.645
Sam is so frustrated.
You'd think a company this size

06:20.647 --> 06:22.914
Would admit their fault
and do the honorable thing.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.717
Well, honor's for battlefields.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.919
Well, if this isn't turning into one

06:27.921 --> 06:29.488
I don't know what is.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.993
Ta-da!

06:34.995 --> 06:37.796
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.632
For your patience and faith.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.101
Steven, I know how hard you're working,
you don't need to--

06:43.103 --> 06:45.904
I found it on one of my all night
web surfing jags.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.906
It's nothing.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.410
I know how much you like
that sort of thing.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.712
It's very thoughtful.
Thank you.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.558
Wow, I'm sorry.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.161
If bad timing were fatal
I'd be road-kill.

07:09.163 --> 07:12.631
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.901
I should be more sensitive
to your situation.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.069
It's not your fault.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.505
It's not like I haven't
thought about it.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.711
You've been really sweet
through this whole thing,

07:26.713 --> 07:29.014
Above and beyond the call of duty.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.817
That's me, nice guy Steven.

07:31.819 --> 07:35.020
The kind of lawyer you want to
introduce to your homely friend.

07:35.022 --> 07:38.990
- That's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

07:41.093 --> 07:45.063
Look, Sam's accident
was a horrible thing.

07:45.998 --> 07:49.468
And the complications surrounding
your case are a nightmare.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.604
I wouldn't wish this
on my worst enemy.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.841
I've known Sam for a long time.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.909
But I see the way
he treats you now.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.780
You've said it yourself.
You and Sam are at a crossroads.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.183
All I want is a chance

08:05.185 --> 08:08.053
To position myself as an option.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.227
I gotta get back to the store.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.496
Yeah.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.766
It's broken.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.068
Oh no.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.805
Wow, did that come out of the box?

08:40.754 --> 08:44.956
- What's the matter?
- I don't want it.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.893
No problem.
um...

08:47.895 --> 08:50.896
Tell you what,
I'll get this appraised.

08:50.898 --> 08:54.232
We can keep it here until
I find out what it's worth.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.668
That will be great.
I'd appreciate it.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.170
You're not leaving, are you?

08:59.172 --> 09:01.840
Yeah, I have to go.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.542
Hey, Lisa...

09:04.610 --> 09:07.779
Is everything okay between us?

09:07.781 --> 09:10.081
Yeah, it's fine. Really.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.984
Okay.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.889
- 'bye.
- I got it.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.099
'bye.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.906
Good one, Steve.
Real smooth.

11:02.962 --> 11:05.163
Sam, I'm home.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.184
- Are you hungry?
- Nope.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.187
You have to have
something for dinner.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.923
I did.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.159
I thought that was breakfast.

11:35.795 --> 11:38.063
Very good.

11:42.435 --> 11:46.271
So, you and Verdel figure out
how to make me a rich man yet?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.039
Not yet.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.141
He does have a plan, doesn't he?

11:50.143 --> 11:53.211
I mean, that's why
you were over there today.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.715
He's working hard on our case
without any compensation.

11:56.717 --> 12:00.885
oh, I'm sure he's
getting compensated.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.088
What do you mean by that?

12:03.090 --> 12:07.025
He's a lawyer, isn't he?

12:07.027 --> 12:11.429
Are you implying that
I slept with him?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.198
Is that what this is about?
Sex?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.433
It's always about sex.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.235
Sex is not that important.
Sam!

12:17.237 --> 12:19.404
It is to me!

12:19.406 --> 12:22.107
And it was to you before--

12:26.746 --> 12:30.014
Our relationship has always
been based on love and trust.

12:30.016 --> 12:33.451
Love and trust are only words
if you can't back them up.

12:36.288 --> 12:40.759
How can you love me
when I can't love you?

12:40.761 --> 12:42.961
I don't care about--

12:49.435 --> 12:52.370
If you want to be alone
you can always go upstairs.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.222
God damn it.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.825
- Not quite.
- What the hell?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.194
That's closer.

13:19.398 --> 13:22.066
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

13:22.068 --> 13:25.103
I'm here to offer you a deal.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.806
Is that right?
A deal?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.474
Who sent you?
Hollister?

13:29.476 --> 13:33.111
Is this some sort of a scare tactic
to get me into a settlement?

13:33.113 --> 13:37.348
If I wanted to scare you,
you would be scared.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.184
Are you?

13:39.186 --> 13:42.387
You tell Hollister I don't care
how powerful he thinks he is,

13:42.389 --> 13:44.856
We're not going to back down.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.092
I suggest you climb back out
the window before I call the cops.

13:48.094 --> 13:52.997
- You wish me to leave?
- No. No.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.433
Not until you meet our city's finest.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.304
I can grant you
anything you desire.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.106
Anything you can imagine.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.944
That sounds to me
like an offer to settle.

14:05.946 --> 14:10.181
It is.
Your soul for a wish.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.584
I wish you would stop
talking in riddles

14:12.586 --> 14:15.019
And tell me exactly
what it is you want.

14:16.889 --> 14:19.157
As you wish.

14:34.106 --> 14:39.110
I want three wishes from the waker.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.881
To free my race
from their eternal bondage.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.584
And now that I've granted your wish,

14:46.586 --> 14:50.188
I will take my soul.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.167
Your identity

15:03.169 --> 15:07.639
will offer me easy
access to the waker.

15:43.142 --> 15:45.476
Nice.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.079
Hello, Lisa.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.518
I was hoping we could spend
a little time together.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.739
Sam.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.461
So much for the trip
down memory lane.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.506
Good morning, Sam.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.275
It's a little early
to be chasing ambulances.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.411
The early bird gets the worm, Sam.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.813
This morning we're going
for the whole garden.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.182
Am I interrupting something here?

17:33.185 --> 17:35.053
Not at all.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.088
Can I get you some coffee?

17:37.090 --> 17:39.657
No. I would like to take
you both out to breakfast

17:39.659 --> 17:42.460
To discuss my new strategy
for your case.

17:42.462 --> 17:47.098
- A new strategy? - Something Lisa
said yesterday inspired me.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.699
Yeah, Lisa's full of inspiration.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.601
You should see her in the morning.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.671
I have interrupted, I'm sorry.
we can go over this another time.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.107
Don't be ridiculous, Verdel.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.309
Get what you came for.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.814
You two don't need me.
just tell me where to sign.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.283
At least I can still do that.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.521
Well...

18:10.523 --> 18:12.723
As your attorney,
I would advise you to pass

18:12.725 --> 18:15.226
On the scintillating
breakfast invitation,

18:15.228 --> 18:17.528
And take this to a more
neutral territory,

18:17.530 --> 18:19.464
My office?

18:19.466 --> 18:22.300
Yeah.
Give me a couple minutes.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.269
Take your time.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.357
I wish you'd join us, Sam.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.892
That's not much of a wish.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.261
I suppose it's not.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.131
I'm certain you could
do better, right?

18:53.133 --> 18:55.133
Not me.
I'm all wished out.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.634
Come on, Sam.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.204
You must have one wish
left inside you somewhere.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.573
I used my last one
right before the doorbell rang.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.243
Really?
How did it turn out?

19:06.211 --> 19:09.180
I think we both know the answer
to that, don't we?

19:13.719 --> 19:15.920
Ready.

19:17.623 --> 19:20.258
Are you sure you won't
come with us, Sam?

19:22.461 --> 19:24.362
Fine.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.342
I'm not kidding.
It's the truth.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.479
Caligula was the most
misunderstood man in rome.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.281
Caligula was a monster.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.286
Don't believe everything you read.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.920
He was a passionate man with a
taste for beauty and extravagance.

19:48.922 --> 19:52.924
- You sound like you knew him.
- Maybe I did-- In another life.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.427
What? What is it?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.863
- What's different about you?
- I told you.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.633
I was inspired last night to become
the man you see before you.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.869
You told me you were
inspired into a new strategy.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.471
Which, by the way,
we have yet to talk about.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.807
Ah yes,

20:09.809 --> 20:11.842
The strategy.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.349
- So?
- I'm waiting for you.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.686
Waiting for me to what?

20:21.688 --> 20:24.989
Tell me what you wish for
and the strategy begins.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.391
Steven, don't tell me
this was just a game

20:27.393 --> 20:29.227
To get me alone with you.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.996
Play the game, Lisa,
then judge me.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.465
Come on, make a wish.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.500
All right.

20:40.872 --> 20:43.808
I wish you could make them
settle this case.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.811
That wasn't so hard, was it?

20:46.813 --> 20:49.413
Will you tell me your plan?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.283
Shh, listen.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.257
- Yeah.
- Doug Hollister, Steven Verdel.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.259
How did you get this number?

21:01.261 --> 21:04.695
Did you have a chance
to go over our new proposal?

21:09.701 --> 21:11.535
What kind of game
are you playing, Verdel?

21:11.537 --> 21:13.939
You're about to find out, Doug.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.007
Do those numbers fall in place for you?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.842
Are you out of your fucking mind?

21:17.844 --> 21:20.845
$10 million?

21:20.847 --> 21:24.015
What are you, the hero
of some John Grisham novel?

21:24.017 --> 21:26.817
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

21:28.687 --> 21:30.889
You call this number again
and you'll be writing briefs

21:30.890 --> 21:33.991
for what's left of your pitiful,
insignificant career!

21:33.993 --> 21:35.496
Don't hang up, Doug.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.962
I'm certain we can
settle this right now.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.300
What the hell is going on?

21:42.302 --> 21:45.469
I suggest you hold your tongue
until we're finished.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.041
Thank you, Doug,
that's very kind of you.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.982
We both know you can
cut off your nose to spite
your face,

21:57.984 --> 22:01.085
But that's not going to change the
testimony of my star witness.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.956
I think you know-- The designer
of the braking system

22:05.958 --> 22:07.925
That failed on my client's bike.

22:11.096 --> 22:14.932
The one that's cashing the
payoff checks to keep him quiet.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.904
Mr. Hollister?

22:20.872 --> 22:23.107
You get the point, Doug, huh?

22:26.511 --> 22:30.014
Graft just doesn't inspire the same
loyalty these days, does it, Doug?

22:34.953 --> 22:37.555
I'll tell you what,
sign the agreement,

22:37.557 --> 22:40.624
fax it over to my office and
we'll end this painful exchange?

23:02.981 --> 23:05.616
I know that you're racked
with pain over this,

23:05.618 --> 23:08.386
but I'm not the one holding
a gun to your head, am I?

23:20.899 --> 23:24.935
You know me, Doug,
I love a good story.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.006
Shoot.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.814
Okay... yeah.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.717
It's been fun, Doug.
All right.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.421
You see?
He was dying to get it done.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.157
Am I supposed to believe someone
was actually on the other end?

23:46.159 --> 23:48.692
Have a look.

23:52.664 --> 23:54.765
I love my job.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.544
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, believe it.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.480
I've also decided
not to take a fee.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.881
Steven?

24:10.883 --> 24:12.783
It is not about money
for me, Lisa.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.486
- I can't let you do that.
- It's done.

24:15.488 --> 24:18.689
Go home and share
the good news with Sam.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.827
Enjoy it.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.963
What happened to you last night?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.966
You might say I was reborn.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.905
Thank you.

24:43.048 --> 24:46.116
- Sam!
- Yeah?

24:47.719 --> 24:49.954
You are not going to believe this!

24:50.956 --> 24:52.656
He did it!
Steven did it!

24:52.658 --> 24:54.725
Sounds like breakfast went well.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.828
$10 million!
They settled

24:57.830 --> 25:00.064
And faxed the agreement
right to his office.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.932
Sam, can you believe this?

25:01.934 --> 25:04.835
Great. Now we can start arguing
about how to split it.

25:04.837 --> 25:08.072
He not taking anything.
he's not taking a fee.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.974
I was talking about us.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.879
- This is good news.
- It is.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.114
It's your last hurdle
on your path to freedom.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.517
I understand why
you're so excited.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.886
You think I've stayed to get
a piece of this settlement?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.988
It's the best reason
I can come up with.

25:26.057 --> 25:28.125
Why are you doing this, Sam?

25:28.127 --> 25:31.128
Why are you doing this to me?

25:37.602 --> 25:39.270
Hello.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.607
It's for you.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.079
Hello.

25:49.081 --> 25:52.082
Have you two booked your trip
around the world yet?

25:52.084 --> 25:54.084
Not yet.

25:54.086 --> 25:59.056
I was hoping I could take you both
to dinner tonight to celebrate.

26:00.825 --> 26:03.861
I don't think so, Steven.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.764
Come on. This case has been hard
on everyone.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.199
Let me share your good fortune
for one night.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.969
I don't think Sam's up to it.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.571
Put him on then.

26:13.573 --> 26:17.007
That's the least he can do
for $10 million.

26:19.744 --> 26:23.113
- What time?
- 8:00, the palace.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.050
Okay.

26:28.954 --> 26:31.088
A few loose ends to tie up?

26:31.090 --> 26:33.691
He wants to take us
to dinner to celebrate.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.359
I assume you don't want to go.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.095
I wouldn't want to be a third wheel.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.097
Or a fourth, fifth,

26:40.099 --> 26:43.100
six and seventh for that matter.

26:58.883 --> 27:00.684
Enjoy your dinner.

27:00.686 --> 27:01.986
Thank you.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.288
Wow! You look fantastic.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.924
- Thank you.
- Please.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.297
Where's Sam?

27:13.299 --> 27:16.300
He didn't feel up to coming.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.938
I took the liberty
of ordering wine.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.107
I hope you don't mind.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.175
So, a toast--

27:25.177 --> 27:27.244
To your new life.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.748
To your amazing work
and incredible generosity.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.183
You keep that up and you'll
have me drunk in no time.

27:37.789 --> 27:40.057
So, what's with Sam?
why wasn't he up to it?

27:40.059 --> 27:42.026
Was he disappointed
with the settlement?

27:42.028 --> 27:44.695
No, it's not about the money.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.898
There's enough to pay the
medical bills and his therapy,

27:47.900 --> 27:49.867
with a fortune left over.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.403
He just...

27:55.807 --> 27:59.009
He pushes me away
every chance he gets.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.046
It's like I'm a part of his injury.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.314
He doesn't know how to communicate--

28:08.887 --> 28:11.155
Is there something else I can do?

28:11.157 --> 28:14.191
You're not a psychiatrist too,
are you?

28:14.193 --> 28:17.161
I can be anything
you want me to be.

28:18.329 --> 28:21.832
The spoken word is a powerful thing.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.935
Don't be afraid to tell me
what's on your mind.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.708
I just wish Sam could walk again.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.911
Yeah.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.112
I understand.

28:57.936 --> 28:59.470
Here we go.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.041
That looks terrific.
Thank you.

29:05.376 --> 29:07.044
Well, dig in.

30:40.972 --> 30:43.106
Can I take these for you?

30:43.108 --> 30:44.609
Yeah, please.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.611
I wish someone would
kiss me like that.

30:47.613 --> 30:51.114
- They will.
- I won't hold my breath.

31:39.530 --> 31:43.634
Lisa, you forgot your dessert.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.072
Sam...

31:50.375 --> 31:52.309
- How was dinner?
- It was great.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.245
Normally I'd say
I wish you were there, but,

31:55.247 --> 31:56.680
that would be a lie.

31:56.682 --> 32:02.119
Obviously you've been busy here
with something more important.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.225
If you need anything...

32:08.227 --> 32:10.127
Call me.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.655
We need to get you to a doctor.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.290
It's not your problem anymore.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.493
If not mine, then whose?

32:43.495 --> 32:47.097
I've been here through it all.
and like it or not,

32:47.099 --> 32:50.033
Whatever this miracle is,
I'm a part of it.

32:50.035 --> 32:52.669
just because I was
out for dinner with Steven--

32:52.671 --> 32:55.439
This is about my legs,
nothing else.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.709
That's why you need
to see a doctor.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.046
Let me rephrase this for you.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.449
All I feel is pain.

33:05.451 --> 33:09.419
And the only place
I have feeling is in my legs.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.659
It means he's walking.

33:15.661 --> 33:19.363
None of the doctors can explain it.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.531
The x-rays still show
the damage, he's in pain,

33:21.533 --> 33:23.066
But he's walking.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.468
I've got to do his chart.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.004
I'll bet anything
mercury went retrograde

33:27.006 --> 33:29.573
And passed through
his fourth house.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.775
What?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.343
I'll explain it later.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.779
What about his mojo?
is that rising?

33:37.115 --> 33:40.017
- What are you talking about?
- Sex.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.585
Have you guys done it yet?

33:42.653 --> 33:45.022
It'll come.
I'll work up his chart

33:45.024 --> 33:47.124
And give you an e.t.e.--

33:48.459 --> 33:51.128
â€œEstimated time of erection."

33:52.663 --> 33:54.498
I don't know.

33:55.566 --> 33:58.135
Do you think this
makes me look too fat?

33:58.137 --> 34:00.303
Only in the right places, right?

34:00.305 --> 34:03.140
- Yeah.
- Really?

34:10.181 --> 34:13.150
Can I help you with something?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.784
Yes, I believe you can.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.386
Steven, what are you doing here?

34:16.388 --> 34:19.056
This is nice, Lisa.
with your new windfall,

34:19.058 --> 34:21.291
You guys could expand
and franchise.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.659
Yeah, we like the intimacy.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.795
It makes it a lot easier
for women to shop.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.831
Especially for underwear.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.167
I don't remember underwear
looking like this.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.369
Great choice, wrong size.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.204
I'd say you're more of a 16.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.840
Course, I couldn't be sure
until I saw it on you.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.141
Would you like a dressing room?

34:39.143 --> 34:41.143
Only if you have the shoes to match.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.080
This is my partner Tracy.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.415
Tracy this is Steven Verdel
our lawyer.

34:46.684 --> 34:48.251
And friend.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.253
Nice to meet you, Tracy.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.757
So you're the man responsible
for the resurrection?

34:53.759 --> 34:56.092
No, he's the man responsible
for the settlement.

34:56.094 --> 35:00.564
Whatever. Destiny has a way of
tying things together.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.199
I couldn't agree more.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.868
In fact, that's why I'm here.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.770
I was hoping when you
got off work

35:06.772 --> 35:08.805
You'd come by my place,
we could talk about it?

35:08.807 --> 35:10.474
Our destiny?

35:10.476 --> 35:13.710
I think the last 24 hours
have been rather miraculous,

35:13.712 --> 35:15.312
Wouldn't you say?

35:15.314 --> 35:17.447
And I was thinking that--
well...

35:17.449 --> 35:20.884
I was hoping that it had
something to do with you and me.

35:24.522 --> 35:26.156
Come on, it will be just talking.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.492
I'll make you a real mean
cup of coffee.

35:30.828 --> 35:33.864
Okay, but I have to check
on Sam first.

35:33.866 --> 35:36.833
Okay then.
Tonight?

35:36.835 --> 35:38.902
- Yeah.
- Great.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.404
- It was nice meeting you.
- You, too.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.711
You'd better be careful, Lisa.

35:47.713 --> 35:51.314
An aura that strong
is capable of anything.

36:01.526 --> 36:02.859
You going somewhere?

36:02.861 --> 36:05.195
Get a beer.
You don't want one, do you?

36:08.933 --> 36:13.537
Since when do you need
a haircut to get a beer?

36:13.539 --> 36:15.272
since I started walking.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.579
Sam, we need to talk about us.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.514
Are you sure you don't
want Verdel here?

36:25.516 --> 36:27.617
He's a good lawyer, isn't he?

36:29.787 --> 36:31.555
I understood your anger before.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.890
I mean, look at you,
you can walk.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.725
I don't understand why
we can't be--

36:35.727 --> 36:37.694
What?

36:37.696 --> 36:39.896
Pretend like it never happened?

36:39.898 --> 36:42.332
pretend like I didn't see
the way you looked at me

36:42.334 --> 36:45.202
When you bathed me, dressed me
and wheeled me down the street?

36:45.204 --> 36:47.771
That is not true.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.739
I always loved you.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.909
You pitied me.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.944
No, you pitied you.

36:55.246 --> 36:58.248
I didn't fall in love
with your legs, Sam.

36:59.483 --> 37:01.751
All I ever wanted was for us
to love each other

37:01.753 --> 37:03.920
Like we did before.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.256
It's not like it was before.

37:06.258 --> 37:09.826
I know. And you remind me
every chance you get.

37:11.495 --> 37:14.864
Look, we're not married.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.801
The settlement's half yours.
why don't we get it over with

37:17.803 --> 37:20.904
And let me pretend to enjoy
whatever time I have left?

37:20.906 --> 37:22.739
What are you talking about?

37:24.275 --> 37:27.644
Sex, Lisa.
I'm talking about sex.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.579
How's it been for you lately?

37:29.581 --> 37:30.981
'cause for me it's been--

37:36.787 --> 37:38.255
Where are you going?

37:40.858 --> 37:43.927
The only place where I won't
be looked at like a patient.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.831
And it only costs me
a dollar a dance.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.394
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:20.431 --> 38:23.536
Do you believe that prayers
can be answered?

38:23.535 --> 38:25.902
Well, I don't know about that,

38:25.904 --> 38:29.406
But I do believe that we can
make our wishes reality.

38:29.408 --> 38:32.375
What's the difference between
a wish and a prayer?

38:32.377 --> 38:35.679
A prayer is an exercise in faith,

38:35.681 --> 38:38.815
But a wish is
a confirmation of desire.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.652
When you desire something
strong enough,

38:42.654 --> 38:44.387
You manifest it as tangible.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.922
All right--

38:45.924 --> 38:49.326
You wished for this lawsuit
to be settled, and it was.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.329
You wished for Sam to walk again,

38:52.331 --> 38:53.697
And he did.

38:54.632 --> 38:56.866
Had you wished for the past,

38:56.868 --> 38:58.935
Sam might not be
where he is tonight.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.570
But you didn't.

39:01.839 --> 39:05.408
I think that the future
holds your destiny--

39:05.410 --> 39:06.743
Not the past.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.847
What do you wish for?

39:17.455 --> 39:20.357
To be the kind of man
you want me to be.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.903
I think the wine went
straight to my head.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.705
I'm going to get some water.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.540
No, no, no.
Stay.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.576
Let me get it.

39:48.452 --> 39:51.788
I wish I could just love you
for who you really are.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.729
Another wish.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.649
What?

40:21.952 --> 40:23.953
What's the matter, Steven?

40:23.955 --> 40:26.055
I want you to leave.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.828
Please.

40:36.033 --> 40:38.101
Okay.

40:52.983 --> 40:54.984
Steve, are you all right?

40:54.986 --> 40:58.488
I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling very well.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.723
It's okay.
I understand.

41:18.609 --> 41:22.111
Why do you delay?
Fulfill the prophecy.

41:22.113 --> 41:25.181
Grant the third wish.

41:26.918 --> 41:30.620
The third wish has been made.
You must grant it

41:30.622 --> 41:32.722
And free your brothers.

41:36.260 --> 41:40.263
Tell me how I shall grant
the third wish,

41:40.265 --> 41:43.900
That she love me
for who I truly am?

41:43.902 --> 41:48.271
Human love is a weakness.
Take her.

41:48.273 --> 41:51.508
Human love must be given freely,

41:51.510 --> 41:53.610
or it isn't love.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.512
It's a trap,

41:55.514 --> 41:58.648
A wish only she can grant.

41:58.650 --> 42:03.119
Be warned,
the hunter has been awakened.

42:12.630 --> 42:15.965
Fulfill the prophecy
before he stops her.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.234
If he kills the waker--

42:18.236 --> 42:22.906
I shall slay the hunter
with his own sword.

42:22.908 --> 42:25.909
No one shall harm the waker.

42:36.687 --> 42:38.588
Go away!

43:07.685 --> 43:10.086
- Hello, Tracy.
- Hi.

43:11.689 --> 43:13.856
I'm sorry to bother you.

43:13.858 --> 43:15.992
I was hoping we could
talk about Lisa.

43:15.994 --> 43:18.294
Don't tell me she stood you up?

43:18.296 --> 43:20.063
No. No.

43:20.065 --> 43:22.699
In fact,
we had a rather nice evening.

43:24.001 --> 43:26.803
I've never had to deal
with these feelings before.

43:26.805 --> 43:28.838
And...

43:28.840 --> 43:30.907
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
bother you with this.

43:30.909 --> 43:32.976
It's okay.
It's what I do.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.877
Come on.

43:40.084 --> 43:42.085
I'm not certain
what I have to offer

43:42.087 --> 43:44.988
Would be appealing
to a woman like Lisa.

43:44.990 --> 43:47.023
You can offer love, can't you?

43:47.025 --> 43:49.659
I love what I do.

43:49.661 --> 43:51.294
Unfortunately, what I do doesn't

43:51.296 --> 43:52.962
Allow me much time for love.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.832
Spoken like a true heartbreaker.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.301
I don't want to break
her heart-- I want to win it.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.938
I was hoping you could give me
some insight on how to do that.

44:01.940 --> 44:04.007
I'm loaded with insight.
Shoot.

44:04.009 --> 44:06.976
Suppose I had some dark secret
I didn't want Lisa to know

44:06.978 --> 44:09.112
But I needed to tell her,
you know?

44:09.114 --> 44:11.047
Do you think she could
still love me?

44:11.049 --> 44:12.982
Depends on the secret.

44:12.984 --> 44:16.786
- You're not married, are you?
- No, I'm not married.

44:16.788 --> 44:19.122
How dark can it be?

44:19.124 --> 44:21.224
I guess it depends on who you ask.

44:21.226 --> 44:25.028
The key to sharing dark secrets
is all in the timing.

44:25.030 --> 44:26.663
You have to pick your moments.

44:26.665 --> 44:29.265
I'd start with wine and roses.

44:29.267 --> 44:31.067
And then?

44:32.970 --> 44:35.304
Do I have to spell
it out for you?

44:35.306 --> 44:38.841
It's obvious to me where you
want this relationship to go.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.677
Remember, we're dealing
with a woman

44:40.679 --> 44:42.145
Who hasn't made love
in three years.

44:42.147 --> 44:44.213
Three years?

45:37.935 --> 45:40.837
It seems like an eternity
since I've romanced a woman.

45:40.839 --> 45:44.474
It's not as complicated
as people make it out to be.

45:44.476 --> 45:46.142
It's all about her.

45:46.144 --> 45:47.977
All you need to do

45:47.979 --> 45:50.179
Is fulfill her every
wish and desire,

45:50.181 --> 45:52.148
And then any revelations

45:52.150 --> 45:54.050
Will seem all the easier
to take.

45:55.152 --> 45:58.020
If you were Lisa,
what would you wish for?

45:58.022 --> 46:00.490
After what she's been through?

46:00.492 --> 46:04.093
If I was Lisa,
I'd wish for some killer sex.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.062
Killer sex?

46:06.064 --> 46:08.030
Killer sex, Steve.

46:08.032 --> 46:11.000
Pushing it past your comfort zone.

46:11.002 --> 46:13.002
That sounds like you're
talking about pain.

46:13.004 --> 46:14.971
Whatever--
pleasure, pain.

46:14.973 --> 46:18.007
It all goes through the Same
nerve center anyway, right?

46:18.009 --> 46:20.076
Seems like you know
what you're talking about.

46:20.078 --> 46:22.145
Not with the men
I've been dating.

46:22.147 --> 46:25.081
I wish I was having
some killer sex.

46:26.250 --> 46:27.884
Granted.

47:16.066 --> 47:18.534
Careful what you wish for, my dear.

47:41.425 --> 47:44.293
Let go!
Let me go!

47:48.131 --> 47:50.967
It's just you.

47:50.969 --> 47:52.435
Is that disappointment or fear?

47:52.437 --> 47:54.136
No. I was having a nightmare.

47:54.138 --> 47:57.473
We were making love
and the weirdest thing happened.

47:57.475 --> 48:00.276
Yeah, I've had that
nightmare a lot lately.

48:00.278 --> 48:02.144
The past.

48:02.146 --> 48:04.614
No, I didn't mean it that way.

48:34.544 --> 48:37.013
Hello?

48:37.015 --> 48:41.150
Is there any way I can bring Tracy up
on murder charges? 'cause she's killing me.

48:42.119 --> 48:43.452
What's going on?

48:43.454 --> 48:47.290
I've been calling her for over
an hour. She won't answer.

48:47.292 --> 48:50.259
Inventory's not finished and
the order has to be in by noon.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.595
I'll be in as soon as I can, okay?

50:37.134 --> 50:39.468
How you doing, pal?
What can I get you?

50:39.470 --> 50:41.303
Your best brandy.

50:57.621 --> 50:59.755
Is that choice, or what?

50:59.757 --> 51:03.592
What do you suppose would make
a woman like that fall in love?

51:03.594 --> 51:05.161
A fat wallet.

51:05.163 --> 51:08.497
- And a fatter dick.
- Money and sex?

51:08.499 --> 51:10.733
That's what makes the world
go round, my friend.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.568
I mean, look at her.

51:12.570 --> 51:14.837
What else would
a piece like that need?

51:14.839 --> 51:17.106
A B.A. in marketing?

51:17.108 --> 51:19.241
She's got her pick
of every guy in this place.

51:19.243 --> 51:21.143
And she knows it.

51:24.448 --> 51:26.715
Then why doesn't she just choose?

51:26.717 --> 51:29.485
She does...
every night.

51:29.487 --> 51:33.689
Relax, it's early.

51:33.691 --> 51:36.826
You wanna be a player,
just step up to the table.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.736
- Do you find her desirable?
- Desirable?

51:47.738 --> 51:50.706
I'd sell my soul just to be
a pimple on her ass.

51:50.708 --> 51:52.541
Really?

51:59.816 --> 52:03.185
Enjoy the view...
brother.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.358
Nick?

52:10.560 --> 52:12.628
Nick?

52:15.265 --> 52:17.433
I don't know how you put up with her.

52:17.435 --> 52:19.368
Believe me, it's mutual.

52:19.370 --> 52:21.206
Did you bring the inventory sheets?

52:22.806 --> 52:24.373
Oh, no.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.342
What I'd tell you?

52:39.556 --> 52:41.390
Good morning.

52:41.392 --> 52:42.925
My name's Jennifer.

52:42.927 --> 52:46.328
And who's the lucky girl
we're shopping for today?

52:47.898 --> 52:49.765
Or boy.

52:49.767 --> 52:51.433
Excuse me.

52:51.435 --> 52:53.836
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?

53:01.845 --> 53:04.180
Don't make me use this
on such a pretty face.

53:04.182 --> 53:07.416
Get the hell out of here
before I call the cops.

53:07.418 --> 53:09.318
Don't say I didn't warn you.

53:13.590 --> 53:15.291
Where is the waker?

53:15.293 --> 53:16.892
Excuse me?

53:16.894 --> 53:19.428
She's awakened the djinn.

53:19.430 --> 53:22.531
She's made the third wish
that will bring upon armageddon.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.767
oh, I see.

53:24.769 --> 53:27.469
Let's see if I can...

53:27.471 --> 53:31.207
Get someone over here
to help find that... waker.

53:33.443 --> 53:37.246
Yes, you may.
There's a tall, attractive man,

53:37.248 --> 53:38.948
robbing my store at this very moment.

54:14.618 --> 54:16.518
Shit.

54:29.399 --> 54:31.567
Looking for clients?

54:31.569 --> 54:33.736
You might say that.

54:33.738 --> 54:35.437
Why did you want
to meet here, Verdel?

54:35.439 --> 54:37.506
Is this where you brought
Lisa for dinner?

54:37.508 --> 54:39.008
I don't think she would appreciate

54:39.010 --> 54:41.510
the amenities this establishment
has to offer.

54:41.512 --> 54:43.479
What do you think of her, Sammy?

54:43.481 --> 54:46.548
'cause she's the fantasy
of every man in this club.

54:46.550 --> 54:49.385
And you can have her
if you want her.

54:49.387 --> 54:50.919
What are you talking about?

54:50.921 --> 54:52.888
Granting you a wish.

54:52.890 --> 54:55.391
How many nights did you sit
in your wheelchair

54:55.393 --> 54:57.860
And wish you could take
a woman like her home?

54:57.862 --> 55:00.396
Would you like
to have sex again, Sam?

55:00.398 --> 55:01.964
The kind of sex you remember?

55:01.966 --> 55:03.966
The kind of sex
you can only dream about?

55:03.968 --> 55:06.835
Because I can make
that happen for you.

55:06.837 --> 55:08.871
Wish for her and she's yours.

55:08.873 --> 55:11.874
Anyway... anywhere.

55:11.876 --> 55:13.976
You can get her for me?

55:14.878 --> 55:16.779
If that's what you wish.

55:20.550 --> 55:22.017
Then I don't want her.

55:22.019 --> 55:24.953
'cause anything you touch,
I want no part of.

55:25.855 --> 55:28.090
Does that include Lisa?

55:28.092 --> 55:31.694
That's right.
I touched her, too.

55:31.696 --> 55:34.396
I got to tell you,
I like the way she feels.

55:34.398 --> 55:36.999
You probably
don't remember that,
do you, Sam?

55:37.001 --> 55:40.669
shall I remind you?
I don't think Lisa would mind.

55:41.604 --> 55:43.339
I got a little secret
for you--

55:43.341 --> 55:46.809
It takes more than two good legs
to satisfy a woman like Lisa.

55:49.012 --> 55:51.016
Don't you want to hit me, Sam?

55:51.015 --> 55:54.383
Yeah, I think you do.

55:54.385 --> 55:58.721
I'll bet you wish you could kick
the shit out of me right here.

55:58.723 --> 56:01.423
Come on, say it.

56:04.961 --> 56:06.929
on my terms, Verdel.

56:06.931 --> 56:08.630
Not yours.

56:59.716 --> 57:02.418
That is a good way to lose
your hand, my friend.

57:02.420 --> 57:04.119
Come on, you know the rules.

57:04.121 --> 57:06.455
Maybe it's time to change them.

57:06.457 --> 57:09.725
Change them? Did you hear this guy?
Pretty funny.

57:09.727 --> 57:12.528
Why don't you find a seat
and enjoy the show?

57:12.530 --> 57:14.963
And the next drink's on me.

57:14.965 --> 57:16.799
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

57:20.537 --> 57:23.105
It seems to me this drink's on you.

57:39.189 --> 57:41.190
I've been waiting a long time

57:41.192 --> 57:44.493
for one of you big spenders to
come in and step over that line.

57:46.896 --> 57:48.831
Let's see what you got, tough guy.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.799
Is that what you wish me to do?

57:50.801 --> 57:52.901
Is that what I wish you to do?

57:52.903 --> 57:55.904
What are you, some kind of fag?
is that it?

57:55.906 --> 57:58.740
Want me to smack you around
so you can get off?

57:58.742 --> 58:01.009
I want to give you what you want.

58:03.513 --> 58:05.614
Get the fuck out of here.

58:05.616 --> 58:07.182
Is that your wish?

58:10.220 --> 58:12.521
Is that your wish,
you sick fuck?

58:14.090 --> 58:16.792
I'm just here to serve you.

58:16.794 --> 58:18.760
fuck off!

58:57.267 --> 58:59.301
You know what I'd wish?

58:59.303 --> 59:01.837
I'd wish you'd put up
a better fight.

59:01.839 --> 59:03.605
Granted.

59:05.775 --> 59:07.743
What the fuck?

59:09.647 --> 59:12.047
Let's see what you got,
tough guy.

59:14.951 --> 59:18.987
That is a good way to lose
your hand, my friend.

59:27.931 --> 59:30.966
This is a better way.

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:04.666
Now, is it mondays and wednesdays,

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:07.002
or tuesdays and thursdays?

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.674
Satisfied, I hope.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.946
Why do you continue to delay?

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.082
Grant the third wish!

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:23.085
I am your only hope for freedom.

01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:26.955
Soon the man the waker loves
will be removed

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.957
And she will be free

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:33.061
To love me as she wished.

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:36.798
We sense your growing
enchantment with the waker.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.802
Be warned--  this will be
the downfall of us all.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.704
Silence!

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:54.983
Are you crazy?
I could have killed you!

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.785
You are the waker of the Djinn!

01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:59.689
You must be killed before
the third wish is granted!

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.287
Run away, Lisa!
go now!

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.389
Just keep running.
don't turn around!

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.396
3000 years between breaths,
my friend.

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:50.866
How does it feel?

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:53.935
It's a pity your life
is merely a charade.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.438
A titan of such nobility,

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.307
Bound until the waker
makes her third wish to me.

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:03.512
A third wish not yet granted.

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:06.181
- What stops you?
- You, my friend.

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:09.251
Destroying you after so many battles

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:11.820
Will make the birth of my race
that much sweeter.

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:16.159
Your human form has made you weak.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.494
I sense conflict...
emotion.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:21.496
The prophecy will be fulfilled!

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:47.189
Your sword is slower
than I remember.

01:03:57.266 --> 01:04:00.468
Playtime is over, hunter.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.305
face your true executioner.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:06.107
You hide your true form
from the waker

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:08.109
And leave your third wish
ungranted.

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.982
Time grows short, demon.

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:16.251
Death awaits you
at the end of my blade.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.986
Death to the Djinn

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:20.989
Is merely the moment
before being reborn.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:24.893
Unlike the eternal darkness
that comes with yours!

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:48.250
You grow weary...

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:51.353
And there is no escape
for you this time.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:55.190
You will make a good
first meal for us!

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:11.139
Listen carefully, my old friend.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.908
The sound of your neck snapping

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.110
Will usher in a new era on earth.

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:18.046
And I will be king of it all.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:40.001
Do you wish a second chance, hunter?

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:45.073
Gamble your soul for another
attempt at futility?

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.075
And let you win?

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:56.551
I always win!

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.480
Sam!

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.215
Sam!

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.758
Hello?

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.326
You're safe?

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:41.062
Steven, where are you?
what just happened?

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:43.131
It's over.
Everything's fine.

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.033
What the hell was that all about?

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:47.035
He was a former client of mine.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:50.038
Some nutcase who decided
he didn't need his medication.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.040
Why was he after me?

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.308
To get to me.

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:56.411
How did you even know
where I was?

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:59.347
I was on my way to your house.
I saw your car.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.649
I heard you screaming.
It doesn't matter.

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:06.521
- This guy's never going to see
the light of day again. - Oh, god.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.089
Is Sam there?

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:10.792
No, I don't know where he is.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.727
I want you to stay
in the house

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:15.497
And lock the doors until
I get there, understand?

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.532
- Lisa?
- Yeah?

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.303
Listen, there's something--

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.305
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:25.640
It's complicated.

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:28.176
I'm having trouble
finding the right words.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:29.244
I'll be here.

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:31.246
Good.

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:14.322
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.191
I won't be back.

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:18.326
If the impulse to mourn
hits you, don't.

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:20.528
This way we can both be happy.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.529
I talked to Steven
and now I understand

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:24.365
just how much he cares for you.

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:26.568
Be happy, Lisa.
Sam.

01:08:54.162 --> 01:08:56.197
Hi.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.233
I was on my way
to bring you these when--

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.638
That's very sweet.

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.314
Is everything all right, Lisa?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:16.384
I'm still a little shaken
from the whole thing.

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.524
Sam just--

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.359
I know.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:28.328
I'm just glad you're safe.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:32.200
The whole way home I could
just imagine the worst.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:34.736
I've been imagining
the worst for weeks.

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.407
I don't understand.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.179
I'd help settle your case,

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.849
And then Sam would find it
in his heart to love you again.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.785
Everything I'd wished for
would be gone.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.189
Then when Sam walked again,

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:57.225
There would be no reason for him
not to embrace you.

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:00.562
To fight for your love--

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:06.634
When your love is all
I've ever wanted.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.001
What's so funny?

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:23.604
I'm not laughing at you,
I'm laughing at me.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:27.342
It's just that,
that was really amazing.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.946
Now I'm waiting for you
to find a subtle way

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:34.816
To excuse yourself and leave.

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:37.885
Why would I do that?

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:40.588
Don't make me start thinking
this is all a dream.

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.725
Isn't it?

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.895
Lisa...

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:51.866
Do you love me
for who I really am?

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:55.536
I love the way
you just made me feel.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.071
That's not what i asked.

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:02.009
A lot's happened
in the last 24 hours.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.445
All the more reason
to answer me then.

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:07.148
Steven.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.417
I need to know now, Lisa.

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:12.153
It's a simple question.

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:14.889
Do you love me
for who I really am?

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:18.059
Who is the real you, Steven?

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:36.110
This was a mistake.

01:13:36.112 --> 01:13:37.945
This was no mistake.
It was a plan.

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:39.680
I gave you what you wanted.

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:42.016
Oh, thank you for the charity.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.752
You said it yourself,
you loved the way I made you feel.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:47.889
There's more to love
than great sex.

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:50.425
Why do you think I stayed with
Sam for so long?

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:52.894
What I don't understand
is why you still care.

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:55.463
He left you, Lisa,
don't you get that?

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:57.899
How would you know that?
did you read his note?

01:13:57.901 --> 01:14:00.968
quite frankly, Steven,
Sam would never confide in you.

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:02.837
I wrote the note.

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.875
- You had no right.
- I did it for you.

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:10.077
- For us.
- I want you to leave.

01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:12.814
- Lisa.
- Now!

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:53.821
You challenge me by revealing
your presence to the waker!

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.224
You failed to seduce
the third wish!

01:14:56.226 --> 01:14:59.026
She must not escape!

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.129
Your interference
has threatened us all!

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.030
Leave her to me!

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:29.023
Running away is not the answer.

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:30.791
Who are you?

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:33.861
That's a question not easily
answered right now.

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:37.832
I am the beast in search
of beauty's love.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.669
The man who opened
his heart to you,

01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:43.838
Made love with you.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.008
A man you trusted
with your deepest feelings.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:49.744
And yet, I still deceived you.

01:15:49.746 --> 01:15:51.979
What does that mean?

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.682
I'm not who you think I am.

01:15:54.684 --> 01:15:56.918
I'm trapped.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.120
And you are the key to my freedom.

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:04.659
If you can find some tiny bit
of love in your heart

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:07.194
for an ugly creature,

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:10.197
You'll release me
from my eternal torment.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:16.971
Is love truly blind, my dear?

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.784
I'm afraid not.

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.057
Lisa.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:43.998
Lisa. Lisa.

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:11.759
There is no escape, Lisa.

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:14.061
Unless I will it.

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:20.034
This place no longer exists
as you remember it.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:22.136
I want things back
the way they were.

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:26.807
Try to look beyond
what your eyes see.

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:33.347
I am only a monster

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:37.084
If you choose to see me as one.

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:40.054
I can wear any body you like,

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:42.723
Any form you desire.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:46.327
What you felt for Verdel,
you can feel for me.

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:50.131
just define the world
that pleases you,

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:52.133
And it's yours.

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:12.887
What lies beyond that wall

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:16.057
Is only frightening
because you can see it.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.959
It is merely a face

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:21.762
put on the greed, violence

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:23.464
and atrocities

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:26.701
that humanity already turns
a blind eye to.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:29.336
It is easily forgotten

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:32.873
if you choose not to look.

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:38.279
This is your reality
if you wish it, Lisa.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:43.117
With a palace like none
this world has ever known.

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:44.985
join me.

01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:47.922
Give your soul freely
and be my queen.

01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:49.957
Anything you can imagine
will be yours.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.959
The world will be
at my fingertips,

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:54.929
And I will be at yours.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:57.965
You'll never be sick.

01:18:57.967 --> 01:18:59.734
You'll never suffer.

01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:01.936
You'll live forever.

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:07.074
- Lisa!
- Sam!

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.043
I had hoped for more!

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.949
I see now that the power
of human love

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:18.419
Is wielded by the object
of affection,

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:21.055
Not by its victim.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:26.961
Here is your knight in shining armor
to save you, Lisa!

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:29.964
Resurrected from the ashes

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:32.333
of misfortune and pity.

01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:34.969
Haven't you figured it out yet?

01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:38.272
The fact that Sam can walk again

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:40.975
is a testament

01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:42.943
of my love for you.

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:44.945
His legs?

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:47.481
I gave them back to him.

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:50.251
I can also give him
back his pain.

01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:52.286
Oh, god!

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:56.023
God is not invited
to this party, Sam.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.994
How do your legs feel?

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:04.265
You see, there was no miracle.

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:06.500
It was merely the second

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:09.069
of Lisa's three wishes.

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:11.172
The granting of the third wish

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:13.574
Is what you've interrupted here.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:15.409
I never made a third wish!

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:18.979
I wish I could love you

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.448
for who you really are.

01:20:23.452 --> 01:20:26.320
You remember.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:30.324
You see, we've created
a bit of a paradox here, Lisa.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:34.328
A wish that only you can grant.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.031
But a wish, nonetheless,

01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:39.300
Which must be granted.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.070
stay away from her!

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.339
A gun?

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:49.043
When did you start
carrying a gun, Sam?

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:51.512
When I found Tracy's body
in her apartment.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:55.049
- I expected to find Verdel there--
- He is Verdel, Sam!

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:56.951
Better?

01:20:56.953 --> 01:20:59.019
What're you going to do now, Sam?

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.965
That's a bit too easy, isn't it?

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:13.500
so, let's try this one.

01:21:13.502 --> 01:21:15.603
it's not really that hard.

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:18.105
Think of all the times
you wanted to kill yourself.

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.978
Very nice.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.946
Now for the real test of mettle.

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:30.117
You wouldn't shoot me,
would you, Sam?

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:32.152
Not the woman you love.

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:36.056
Not the woman who stood by you
through all your pain and suffering.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:38.993
- Shoot it, Sam!
- I love you, Sam.

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:43.163
I always will.

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:47.468
Shoot it!
Shoot it, it's not me!

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:03.050
You can't kill an immortal
with a toy.

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:09.023
There are many kinds of love, Lisa.

01:22:09.025 --> 01:22:11.659
It's time we explored some of them.

01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:14.161
No! A wish!

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:16.030
You offered me a wish once before.

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:18.966
- Don't!
- Is it still mine to make?

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:21.135
Your soul for a wish.

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.536
Don't do it, Sam!
it's a trick!

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:26.040
Choose your words carefully, Sam.

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:28.042
I wish I had a way to kill you!

01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:29.610
Granted.

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:44.358
Now you have the means,

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.727
all you need is the effort.

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:02.543
Now, my turn.

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:09.249
Your death...

01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:11.552
is only the beginning.

01:23:11.554 --> 01:23:14.421
Your soul belongs to me

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:16.657
for eternity.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.996
Sam!

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:27.001
It doesn't have
to be this way, Lisa.

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:29.236
I can make this nightmare...

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:31.405
end for you right now.

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.142
Let me give you paradise.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.715
Paradise would be one more bullet.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:44.251
Unfortunately,

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:46.687
it won't be that easy for you.

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:49.390
You've made your wishes.

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:54.695
You disappoint me, Lisa!

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:03.570
Your fate is inextricably
tied to me.

01:24:03.572 --> 01:24:06.640
It has been so since you
found that stone.

01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:10.144
What's done cannot be undone.

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:14.048
Grant the wish

01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:18.118
or this torment will never end
for either of us.

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.291
I offer you...

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:27.061
one last chance

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:30.431
to escape the torment
that awaits you.

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:35.669
Give me your love,

01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:39.239
and the universe is yours.

01:24:54.689 --> 01:24:56.423
Not like that.

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:00.360
What is it you want?

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:04.164
I need Sam back.

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.669
Lisa.

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:13.841
I love you.

01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:16.243
Be with me forever.

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.747
Love me like you did before.

01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:20.440
Oh, Sam.
