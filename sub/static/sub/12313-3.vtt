18:10.979 --> 18:14.113
I need to meet with a colleague.

19:14.942 --> 19:17.610
I'm sure that must be frustrating,

19:17.645 --> 19:20.646
and, oh, gosh, feel unfair,

19:20.682 --> 19:22.014

19:26.888 --> 19:30.323
I'm sure you two will find a way.

19:30.358 --> 19:32.758
I've been thinking about IVF,

19:32.794 --> 19:35.561
but I'm worried about how
to bring it up with Evan.

19:35.596 --> 19:36.595
Why?

19:36.631 --> 19:38.164
Well, you know how sensitive he is,

19:38.199 --> 19:40.800
and he already feels bad
about his low motility.

19:40.835 --> 19:43.469
Low motility is precisely why
IVF could be the best idea.

19:43.504 --> 19:44.970
But from what I've read, a lot of men

19:45.006 --> 19:46.339
can have reservations about it.

19:46.374 --> 19:47.540
- Why is that?
- Oh, you know,

19:47.575 --> 19:49.308
it bruises their fragile egos,

19:49.344 --> 19:51.410
or minimizes their role or something.

19:51.446 --> 19:53.979
And Evan has been such a
good sport through all this.

19:54.015 --> 19:55.681
Okay, listen. I know Evan

19:55.717 --> 19:57.183
has loads of insecurities.

19:57.218 --> 19:58.984
I've had hours of fun poking at them,

19:59.020 --> 20:00.653
so I understand your concern,

20:00.688 --> 20:04.724
but not all men feel that way about IVF.

20:04.759 --> 20:07.426
- What do you mean?
- Raj.

20:07.462 --> 20:10.096
His twins are a result of
in vitro fertilization,

20:10.131 --> 20:13.766
but in his case, it was Karen
who had problems conceiving.

20:13.801 --> 20:15.201
So he's been through the process,

20:15.236 --> 20:17.403
and he's never been
shy about sharing it.

20:17.438 --> 20:19.872
So, if he spoke to Evan...

20:19.907 --> 20:22.842
Or, what if we had you
guys over for dinner,

20:22.877 --> 20:24.410
like we've been saying we should do?

20:24.445 --> 20:26.912
Then we could steer the
conversation that way,

20:26.948 --> 20:28.348
and Raj could take over naturally.

20:28.349 --> 20:29.882
Yes. Are you free tonight?

20:29.917 --> 20:31.751
Yes. Should we bring dessert?

No, no. Dessert, we have.

20:33.187 --> 20:35.154

20:58.212 --> 21:00.079
why we are walking out here like this.

21:00.114 --> 21:03.115
Our announcement has provoked interest.

21:05.319 --> 21:07.486
So our plan must continue.

21:07.522 --> 21:09.054
Guy Childs called me.

21:09.090 --> 21:12.324
He's heard doubts from
some of my competitors

21:12.360 --> 21:14.126
about my illness.

21:14.162 --> 21:16.028
They're demanding DNA proof.

21:16.063 --> 21:17.329
Did he say which competitors?

21:17.365 --> 21:19.999
No, but according to him,

21:20.034 --> 21:23.235
the Chinese are suddenly
eager to partner in research

21:23.271 --> 21:27.640
where my genetic material
could prove useful.

21:27.675 --> 21:30.409

I've always wondered

21:38.085 --> 21:40.920
if he was merely a journalist.

21:40.955 --> 21:43.022
Both rumors were filtered through him.

So we need to stay one step ahead of Guy

how to force his hand.

21:49.864 --> 21:52.865
to appear to give him what he wants.

- Yeah, well, yeah...

34:13.795 --> 34:15.463
One night, we'd run
out of whipped cream,

34:15.498 --> 34:18.632
her best stabilizer, and I
was in a race against time

34:18.668 --> 34:19.900
with the mixer on ten,

34:19.936 --> 34:21.835
and I got the spoon twisted
up in the blades...

34:21.871 --> 34:22.969
- That's funny.
- And I went outside

34:23.005 --> 34:24.938
and howled at the moon.

34:24.974 --> 34:26.774
Not my finest hour.

34:26.809 --> 34:29.744
It may, in fact, well have been
the beginning of the end for us.

34:29.779 --> 34:31.712
Yeah, well, it's over now, and, uh,

34:31.748 --> 34:33.681
you got two great kids out
of the bargain, so...

34:33.716 --> 34:35.483
And I couldn't love them more.

34:35.518 --> 34:38.284
Though sometimes I still
do hold it against them.

34:38.321 --> 34:40.755

- I'm not proud of it.

34:40.790 --> 34:42.089

way of making a baby.

It's all about when you're ready.

have the procedures.
