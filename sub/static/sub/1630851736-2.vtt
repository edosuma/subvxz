10:45.562 --> 10:47.731
Some people are looking for alternatives.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.983
<i>Now, the meatless craze
sweeping through grocery stores,</i>

10:49.983 --> 10:51.568
<i>restaurants...
Shares of plant‐based</i>

10:51.568 --> 10:53.570
protein company are soaring today.

10:53.570 --> 10:57.115
<i>Veggie burgers are here.</i>

10:58.909 --> 11:00.536
Let's take a break.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.996
Here's an Impossible Burger

11:02.996 --> 11:06.333
from Burger King.
I've not tasted this.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.876
You've never had this?

11:10.546 --> 11:12.089
Is this a normal burger size?

11:12.923 --> 11:15.133
‐ It's a Whopper.
‐ Whoppers are fucking huge.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.218
‐ Yeah.

11:17.553 --> 11:20.222
<i>I think the burger that Americans</i>

11:20.222 --> 11:23.267
have fallen in love with,
the thin patty burger,

11:23.267 --> 11:25.853
is not even about the burger meat.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.356
It's about eating something that
has balance, that has crunch, texture.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.234
Oh, this is Beyond Meat?
Didn't know that.

11:32.234 --> 11:35.654
<i>The mayonnaise, the ketchup, the mustard,</i>

11:35.654 --> 11:36.989
<i>the tomato.</i>

11:38.115 --> 11:40.659
It's not about eating actual beef.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.496
In the future, they're gonna
be able to make a burger

11:44.496 --> 11:48.166
that is indistinguishable.
It's already almost there.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.962
‐ Can you really get any closer than this?

11:53.463 --> 11:55.841
‐ Why are you asking me like
I have the fucking answer?

11:55.841 --> 11:57.426
‐ Or should I be like,
"Who's got the answer?"

11:59.469 --> 12:02.681
If I don't know if I'm a large
or an extra‐large smock man.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.892
I feel like smocks run large.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.728
<i>Please note David Chang
is an investor in Impossible,</i>

12:07.728 --> 12:10.063
<i>and therefore felt it necessary to
recuse himself from this scene.</i>

12:10.063 --> 12:12.107
<i>He was also worried
he would look bad in a smock.</i>

12:12.107 --> 12:14.359
<i>What's wrong with the way we eat meat now?</i>

12:14.359 --> 12:17.654
Why can't we just keep eating
this the way we do?

12:17.654 --> 12:20.490
Livestock, as a technology, plateaued

12:20.490 --> 12:22.075
a long time ago, okay?

12:22.075 --> 12:25.245
A cow turns protein from plants

12:25.245 --> 12:27.206
into meat protein

12:27.206 --> 12:29.625
with a three percent efficiency.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.629
That means we're stuck with
limitations in terms of creating food.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.131
<i>When you say,
"We're going to create food</i>

12:36.131 --> 12:38.717
<i>"using ingredients from nature,</i>

12:38.717 --> 12:41.512
<i>"but we'll design the flavor,</i>

12:41.512 --> 12:43.514
<i>we'll design the texture,"</i>

12:43.514 --> 12:47.100
<i>the space of possibilities
is vastly greater.</i>

12:48.519 --> 12:51.855
<i>When people think
about taste, it's really complicated.</i>

12:51.855 --> 12:54.483
Taste is just like what
we can taste on our tongue,

12:54.483 --> 12:58.070
but flavor is actually
mostly smell, right?

12:58.070 --> 13:02.282
<i>It's actually hundreds of compounds,
all in the right ratios,</i>

13:02.282 --> 13:04.743
<i>that allow your brain
to recognize it as beef.</i>

13:04.743 --> 13:07.120
<i>So, we use this instrument.</i>

13:07.120 --> 13:11.083
We might take a piece of beef
and actually cook it on there,

13:11.083 --> 13:13.460
and then the different
aromas are captured,

13:13.460 --> 13:16.171
and you're actually able to
take that really complex mixture

13:16.171 --> 13:19.758
and separate it out into
individual flavor molecules.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.928
We can get them from
plant‐based ingredients,

13:22.928 --> 13:26.056
but if you were to just cook that,
it would taste like okay.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.933
Not really like meat.

13:27.933 --> 13:31.895
What's essential is that you have heme,

13:31.895 --> 13:33.772
which is our magic ingredient.

13:33.772 --> 13:34.982
♪ angelic singing ♪

13:34.982 --> 13:37.192
I feel like if this was
a corporate espionage movie,

13:37.192 --> 13:40.070
this is like the vial I would try to run
out of here with or something.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.864
Yeah,
we're gonna hold onto that one.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.533
‐ I put this into my‐‐ This is <i>Jurassic
Park</i>. This is what I'd be trying to sell.

13:45.659 --> 13:49.496
<i>Heme was the kind
of tipping point, you could say.</i>

13:49.496 --> 13:53.041
It's found in every living cell on Earth,
okay? So, it's not meat specific,

13:53.041 --> 13:54.918
but animal tissues have like 100‐

13:54.918 --> 13:57.629
or 1,000‐fold higher
concentrations of this molecule.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.923
<i>We found that it's actually</i>

13:59.923 --> 14:02.009
<i>in the root nodules of soy plants.</i>

14:02.009 --> 14:03.844
<i>And then, we do a fermentation,</i>

14:03.844 --> 14:06.805
<i>just like you ferment yeast to make beer.</i>

14:06.805 --> 14:09.391
Is the red inherent
to heme, or is... Okay.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.935
Yep. It's from the iron, right?
‐ Okay.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.562
Like when you're grilling,
starts off red,

14:13.562 --> 14:15.898
<i>that's because of the heme. And then,</i>

14:15.898 --> 14:18.525
you expose it to heat
and oxygen, it turns brown,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.652
and all of that flavor is generated.
I see.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.864
<i>At scale, our economics</i>

14:23.864 --> 14:26.992
<i>are vastly superior
to making it from cow.</i>

14:26.992 --> 14:28.869
But, we still have
a long way to go. I mean,

14:28.869 --> 14:31.288
we're not declaring victory
or anything close to it.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.915
<i>Our mission is to</i>

14:32.915 --> 14:35.417
<i>completely replace animals
as a food technology</i>

14:35.417 --> 14:37.377
<i>by 2035.</i>

14:37.377 --> 14:40.756
You should choose what you want,
and it's on us

14:40.756 --> 14:43.842
to make the obvious choice
be a plant‐based product.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.221
<i>Taste is the great equalizer.</i>

14:47.638 --> 14:50.015
And it's not about changing
the vegans and the vegetarians.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.935
It's about changing the meat eaters.
If you can change

14:52.935 --> 14:54.811
someone that eats...

14:54.811 --> 14:57.314
beef, you know,

14:57.314 --> 15:00.567
from five days a week to two days a week?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.903
That, I think, is a giant,

15:02.903 --> 15:04.613
you know, gold mine for people.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.328
<i>Your shop doesn't have a big sign</i>

15:11.328 --> 15:14.456
that says, "vegan restaurant!"
No.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.251
I bet you have a portion of customers

15:17.251 --> 15:18.710
who have no idea that
they ate a vegan burger

15:18.710 --> 15:20.337
and will never know that
they ate a vegan burger.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.005
‐ And sometimes, they come back

15:22.005 --> 15:24.675
and they're angry when
they do find out, and I'm like...

15:25.634 --> 15:26.844
was it good though?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.557
‐ What's cool about what's happening here

15:31.557 --> 15:35.769
is the same factors
that make a meat burger good

15:35.769 --> 15:38.730
are the same things that would
make a vegan burger delicious.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.567
<i>It's like a little bit of
logic got lost somewhere.</i>

15:41.567 --> 15:44.403
<i>Absolutely, and that's where
we come in where it's like, no.</i>

15:44.403 --> 15:46.029
We're just gonna do the same thing

15:46.029 --> 15:48.156
<i>you do for a regular burger,</i>

15:48.156 --> 15:50.742
<i>just with alternative
ingredients, you know?</i>

15:51.618 --> 15:54.079
This is the base of our Mama Spread.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.165
There's a couple ingredients
that we can't show.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.293
‐ Secret ingredients, huh?
Secret ingredients that

15:59.293 --> 16:01.587
I can't show on camera or else my mom

16:01.587 --> 16:03.589
will literally kill both of us.

16:05.924 --> 16:06.967
<i>It's really good, man.</i>

16:07.885 --> 16:11.138
<i>Before you were running restaurants,
did you see vegan food like this</i>

16:11.138 --> 16:14.391
that was decadent? This is decadent.
‐ No. No.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.767
<i>Yeah. We really</i>

16:15.767 --> 16:18.478
<i>just try to make the food fun,
make it flavorful,</i>

16:18.478 --> 16:21.815
things that you aren't traditionally
getting in vegan restaurants.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.611
<i>My first adult burger was a Big Mac.
Yeah.</i>

16:25.611 --> 16:29.364
‐ And I love, love, love, love Big Macs.
Uh‐huh.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.452
<i>So when I was developing,
coming up with burgers for here,</i>

16:33.452 --> 16:35.329
<i>I created a vegan Big Mac.
Yeah.</i>

16:35.329 --> 16:38.373
<i>We call it the Tasha Grande,
and it's a hit.</i>

16:40.334 --> 16:43.170
‐ That's so good! That's ridiculous, man.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.755
I was like, oh,
what's he about to say?

16:44.755 --> 16:46.465
No, I think it's honestly,

16:46.465 --> 16:48.175
I always think it's
the biggest mistake restaurants,

16:48.175 --> 16:49.426
not even just vegan restaurants,

16:49.426 --> 16:51.220
but restaurants can make
is trying to tap into

16:51.220 --> 16:53.597
somebody's nostalgia that way,
and then miss.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.933
Like, that's so fucking good.

16:57.267 --> 17:01.605
The future means
more people have to eat less meat,

17:01.605 --> 17:04.650
if any meat at all.
Exactly, and Malibu's Burgers

17:04.650 --> 17:06.610
is designed to make the meat eaters say,

17:06.610 --> 17:09.238
"oh man. This is good." So,

17:09.238 --> 17:12.032
it's for that person
that wants that burger.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.159
I don't promote it as like health food.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.286
It's just an alternative.

17:16.286 --> 17:19.831
‐ This causes all kinds of problems though
because a lot of these ingredients

17:19.831 --> 17:22.751
that you need to make
these meat substitutes

17:22.751 --> 17:24.378
come from vegetable matter

17:24.378 --> 17:27.422
or are very difficult to extract

17:27.422 --> 17:31.260
or to produce, so it's very
cost ineffective, right?

17:31.260 --> 17:32.761
So,

17:32.761 --> 17:35.264
we're headed towards a bottleneck.

17:38.517 --> 17:42.104
<i>Vegetable proteins
are really catching traction.</i>

17:42.896 --> 17:46.024
But there's a lot of misinformation
out there about

17:46.024 --> 17:48.652
the way beef can be produced

17:48.652 --> 17:51.196
and about the way the protein sources for

17:51.196 --> 17:53.198
<i>the vegetable proteins are produced.</i>

17:54.533 --> 17:58.161
<i>My family's operated
this farm for 156 years.</i>

17:59.288 --> 18:01.039
And the farm's come full circle.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.750
<i>Over the last 25 years,</i>

18:03.750 --> 18:05.961
<i>me and my daughters are taking it</i>

18:05.961 --> 18:08.380
back to a production model

18:08.380 --> 18:11.592
that more resembled what was important to

18:11.592 --> 18:13.468
my great‐grandfather and grandfather.

18:14.511 --> 18:18.473
<i>I gave up confinement feeding of grain.</i>

18:18.473 --> 18:22.311
<i>I gave up subtherapeutic antibiotics.</i>

18:22.311 --> 18:24.605
And as a result, I suffered in production.

18:24.605 --> 18:28.525
I didn't raise as much beef
as I had previously.

18:28.525 --> 18:31.778
But, I think we're doing the right thing.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.031
This is a daikon radish.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.200
We plant these for the cattle,

18:36.200 --> 18:38.827
and they're really enjoying them now.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.038
<i>I think what makes our burgers good</i>

18:41.038 --> 18:44.041
is our cattle are athletic animals.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.377
Our cattle eat

18:47.377 --> 18:50.631
nothing but grass and what grows here.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.883
It's a natural diet for them.

18:52.883 --> 18:54.801
They're out walking, moving.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.846
<i>We also gave up</i>

18:57.846 --> 19:00.766
<i>chemical fertilizers and pesticides.</i>

19:00.766 --> 19:02.935
Started using animal impact

19:02.935 --> 19:06.021
to emulate nature, biomimicry,

19:06.021 --> 19:07.731
and the land got better.

19:08.649 --> 19:11.068
<i>In nature, there is no waste.</i>

19:11.068 --> 19:14.154
So, we operate our farm as zero waste.

19:15.614 --> 19:18.909
<i>There is a report that every pound of beef</i>

19:18.909 --> 19:20.869
that we sell for consumption,

19:20.869 --> 19:24.373
we bring down 3.5 pounds
of carbon dioxide equivalent.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.794
<i>So, if a person tells me
they're vegetarian</i>

19:28.794 --> 19:31.880
<i>because they can't bear
the thought of eating</i>

19:31.880 --> 19:34.800
<i>an animal that lived, I respect that.</i>

19:34.800 --> 19:37.010
But I will not allow

19:37.010 --> 19:38.846
people to tell me

19:38.846 --> 19:42.015
that they're eating vegetable protein

19:42.015 --> 19:43.475
to save the planet.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.478
<i>The fact is the way that the corn</i>

19:46.478 --> 19:48.856
<i>and soy and beans are raised,</i>

19:48.856 --> 19:51.066
<i>industrially, monoculturally,</i>

19:51.066 --> 19:54.486
<i>using GMOs and chemical
fertilizers and pesticides,</i>

19:54.486 --> 19:57.406
is way worse for the environment

19:57.406 --> 19:58.782
than what we're doing here.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.875
<i>Not all farming is bad.
You can have it done</i>

20:07.875 --> 20:11.003
<i>in a way that is adding value.
What we need to get rid of</i>

20:11.003 --> 20:13.463
<i>is commodity farms.</i>

20:13.463 --> 20:16.008
I'm sure my economist professor
in college would be like,

20:16.008 --> 20:18.427
"Do not ask David these questions."

20:18.427 --> 20:20.429
But it's gonna be more expensive.
That's for sure.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.347
<i>And...</i>

20:22.347 --> 20:25.350
if beef gets too expensive,
then you're losing...

20:26.560 --> 20:29.146
calories. People survive off this

20:29.146 --> 20:32.107
'cause it is affordable.
It is cheap. So,

20:32.107 --> 20:34.401
it is inevitable

20:34.401 --> 20:37.654
that we're going to be eating
more lab‐grown meat.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.240
This is all already here.

20:42.868 --> 20:45.370
<i>For meat loyalists,
there is now something called</i>

20:45.370 --> 20:47.372
<i>cellular agriculture.</i>

20:47.372 --> 20:49.124
<i>Meat is grown in a lab instead
of inside an animal...</i>

20:49.124 --> 20:51.752
<i>Some Bay Area startups are racing now</i>

20:51.752 --> 20:53.337
<i>to fill your plate...</i>

20:53.337 --> 20:56.173
The future of meat production
may be in a lab.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.928
<i>The basic process,
it's a very simple idea.</i>

21:00.928 --> 21:03.180
You get cells from an animal
that you eat already,

21:03.180 --> 21:05.432
muscle cells, fat cells,
connective tissue,

21:05.432 --> 21:08.185
you take them back here
behind us into our facility.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.437
You feed them the same thing
the animal would eat.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.440
Amino acids, vitamins, minerals,
all those things that you would need

21:13.440 --> 21:16.193
for the animal to live, you just
feed them directly to the cells.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.862
And they'll keep growing.
They got their DNA running.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.156
They're still alive, so they're just
gonna keep making more and more,

21:21.156 --> 21:23.492
as long as they're fed, they're warm,
they got water, they got oxygen,

21:23.492 --> 21:27.204
whatever...
‐ Wait, so how long does it take to grow?

21:27.204 --> 21:29.706
‐ So here's the kicker.
How long's it take a cow to grow

21:29.706 --> 21:32.251
from birth to it's
on a shelf in marketplace?

21:32.251 --> 21:33.669
Couple years?
‐ Yeah!

21:33.669 --> 21:35.462
18 months, 24 months,
something like that.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.756
<i>We're doing a cow's worth of material</i>

21:37.756 --> 21:39.633
<i>in two to three weeks.</i>

21:39.633 --> 21:40.926
I can imagine this is

21:40.926 --> 21:44.179
probably extremely expensive
to produce right now.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.557
When we first started,
it was incredibly expensive,

21:46.557 --> 21:50.102
but the innovation that
we've done in the last five years

21:50.102 --> 21:53.564
have brought it to the level where we're
not the most expensive meat in the world.

21:53.564 --> 21:57.109
We absolutely believe that we can bring it
to the price, initially, of premium meats,

21:57.109 --> 22:01.238
and then eventually with conventional
prices, we actually will be able to

22:01.238 --> 22:03.866
be at that level or beat them.
So, if you're gonna make a burger,

22:03.866 --> 22:06.869
you're not turning it into ground beef.
You're making beef,

22:06.869 --> 22:08.203
and then turning it into ground.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.414
There's two ways to make a burger.

22:10.414 --> 22:14.001
Sort of build the burger directly
by growing it in that shape,

22:14.001 --> 22:17.045
or you can grow the muscle and grind it.
Grind it down.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.507
‐ Like, that's... real insanity.

22:22.176 --> 22:24.678
What exactly do you have?
I don't even know.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.638
Is it beef? Is it chicken?

22:26.638 --> 22:28.599
So, we're doing chicken today,
but what we're doing

22:28.599 --> 22:31.518
applies to beef and all the meats
that we're doing.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.895
Can I pick it up?
Yeah.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.525
This started from a single cell
multiple years ago.

22:39.902 --> 22:41.612
Wow.

22:41.612 --> 22:44.072
The cells we use,
we can make meat from now

22:44.072 --> 22:47.326
between 10 and 20 years
from a single set of cells.

22:47.326 --> 22:50.037
‐ But you could, say, just theoretically

22:50.037 --> 22:52.039
just recreate like...

22:52.039 --> 22:53.832
a geoduck?

22:53.832 --> 22:57.252
‐ I love where you're going with this.
Yes, we could do that.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.755
You could do a geoduck.
You could go even further back

22:59.755 --> 23:02.466
and do its ancestor, the dinosaur,
if you really wanted to.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.641
This is the most excited I've been...

23:10.641 --> 23:12.059
in a long time.

23:12.059 --> 23:14.394
I'm, like, trying

23:14.394 --> 23:16.480
to process in my mind

23:16.480 --> 23:19.483
the repercussions this is going to have

23:19.483 --> 23:22.694
when it's to market, at scale.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.740
This is wild.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.993
Can I slice?
Absolutely.

23:31.787 --> 23:34.164
How does it feel as you cut it?
It feels like meat.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.468
That's hilarious.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.470
It's chicken.

23:51.807 --> 23:54.268
<i>There is so much demand for meat.</i>

23:54.268 --> 23:56.603
Right now,
we're producing 750 billion pounds.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.689
In the next 30 years, we're double that.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.399
When I talk about this innovation

24:00.399 --> 24:02.901
to ranchers, or when I talk about this to

24:02.901 --> 24:05.404
conventional meat producers,
what I'm telling them is, "Look,

24:05.404 --> 24:07.364
"your production system

24:07.364 --> 24:09.616
"has been feeding the world with meat.

24:10.659 --> 24:13.829
"But there's this big delta.
We still have to double that production.

24:13.829 --> 24:14.997
How are we gonna do that?"

24:14.997 --> 24:17.124
And, ultimately, in a future state,

24:17.124 --> 24:20.752
I think the number of animals that need
to be raised for meat will be decreased.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.462
<i>Balance.</i>
‐ Will be decreased.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.839
<i>Balance.</i>
‐ Decreased.

24:23.839 --> 24:25.841
<i>Balance.</i>
‐ And production methods

24:25.841 --> 24:27.593
that preserve the real choice,

24:27.593 --> 24:30.429
and alternative methods are the ones
that'll come to the forefront.

24:31.388 --> 24:33.557
<i>A great burger's about balance,</i>

24:33.557 --> 24:35.184
<i>whether people realize it or not.
Eating something</i>

24:35.184 --> 24:38.520
that has balance... To me,
hamburgers and pizzas, not a surprise

24:38.520 --> 24:40.105
everyone likes them. It has that same

24:40.105 --> 24:42.191
<i>balance... balance... balance...</i>

24:42.691 --> 24:46.904
The juxtaposition of it is what makes it
sort of... delicious!

24:48.071 --> 24:49.948
<i>And there are other ways to take</i>

24:49.948 --> 24:52.409
<i>the patterns that make it delicious</i>

24:52.409 --> 24:54.328
<i>and construct something</i>

24:54.328 --> 24:56.622
that actually isn't even a burger.

24:58.248 --> 25:01.710
<i>In Indian culture,
majority vegetarian,</i>

25:01.710 --> 25:05.088
<i>so many of their things
don't look anything like meat,</i>

25:05.088 --> 25:06.924
<i>and it's wonderful!</i>

25:06.924 --> 25:08.425
<i>Sure, here in America,</i>

25:08.425 --> 25:10.052
<i>burgers might be one of the most prevalent</i>

25:10.052 --> 25:11.762
<i>forms of fast food,</i>

25:11.762 --> 25:15.599
but in India, in fact,
fast food takes many forms.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.559
It's‐‐ Ooh, Dave.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.938
It's often sold on the streets

25:20.938 --> 25:23.982
<i>under this category called chaat,
which is a category</i>

25:23.982 --> 25:26.985
<i>of, like, spicy, tangy,</i>

25:26.985 --> 25:29.655
<i>sweet, bright Indian snacks.</i>

25:29.655 --> 25:31.823
<i>Things like vada pav.</i>

25:33.283 --> 25:35.035
So you've got this mixture that's

25:35.035 --> 25:36.995
potatoes, cilantro,

25:36.995 --> 25:38.830
chaat masala, curry leaves.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.499
We're gonna form this into balls.

25:40.499 --> 25:42.876
We're gonna dredge it in
this chickpea flour batter.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.963
Chris is gonna fry it, and then
I'm gonna make a quick cilantro chutney.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.840
For me,

25:47.840 --> 25:49.758
the beauty of chaat in
a dish like vada pav

25:49.758 --> 25:51.635
is it, like, hits everything.

25:51.635 --> 25:53.428
It's almost engineered

25:53.428 --> 25:55.264
to be the most craveable food on Earth.

25:55.264 --> 25:56.598
Mm‐hmm.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.892
So, to that point, vada pav has

25:58.892 --> 26:02.354
the same core things that
make a burger good, right?

26:02.354 --> 26:05.023
You need a little acidity,
you need sweetness, you need fat.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.817
I think one thing that makes Indian food,

26:06.817 --> 26:08.777
and chaat specifically, so great

26:08.777 --> 26:10.696
is the balance. This notion of

26:10.696 --> 26:12.239
you've got sweet, but you've got sour.

26:12.239 --> 26:14.575
You've got spicy, but you've got fresh.

26:14.575 --> 26:16.702
Texture variation,
temperature variation...

26:16.702 --> 26:18.370
You guys are just explaining a burger.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.455
That's what I just said!
That's what we said,

26:20.455 --> 26:22.082
yeah. We were like...
‐ I just‐‐ Again, I'm sorry.

26:22.082 --> 26:23.709
I always tune him out,
I listen to you,

26:23.709 --> 26:25.210
you know.
Wah‐wah‐wah‐wah‐wah.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.337
If vada pav catches on,
then we don't need to worry

26:27.337 --> 26:29.298
about alternative meat.

26:29.298 --> 26:31.550
We don't need to worry about‐‐
‐ I don't know why we're even talking

26:31.550 --> 26:34.178
about all of these, like,
factory lab‐made meats

26:34.178 --> 26:35.721
when we have

26:35.721 --> 26:37.973
other forms of fast food.
We got the solution here.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.601
To me, an American burger is just

26:40.601 --> 26:42.811
a beefy vada pav.

26:42.811 --> 26:44.521
‐ Ray Kroc and the McDonald's brothers,

26:44.521 --> 26:46.690
<i>that's how. They stole it from India,</i>

26:46.690 --> 26:49.026
<i>popularized by the Beatles,
it all happened.</i>

26:54.072 --> 26:55.574
It's so good.
‐ So good.

26:56.116 --> 26:58.827
What if you just served it as a patty?

26:58.827 --> 27:01.622
What do you mean?
‐ Less than a golf ball

27:01.622 --> 27:03.582
and more as a patty.

27:03.582 --> 27:06.835
‐ He's literally doing it
just like a burger.

27:06.835 --> 27:09.296
I hope that McDonald's calls this

27:09.296 --> 27:11.715
the McChang.
McChang.

27:12.382 --> 27:13.967
<i>Like, I'm not trying to be</i>

27:13.967 --> 27:15.427
<i>disrespectful at all.</i>

27:15.427 --> 27:17.930
<i>I just love potatoes, and I love cheese.
I love vada pav.</i>

27:17.930 --> 27:19.681
<i>We're talking about all these burgers.</i>

27:19.681 --> 27:22.184
<i>That looks amazing!
Oh shit.</i>

27:28.565 --> 27:30.859
It's so good though!
Hurts so good, huh?

27:30.859 --> 27:33.862
I'm sweating bullets from the heat!

27:33.862 --> 27:35.239
Modern companies

27:35.239 --> 27:37.407
are trying to come up with
a new technology to replace beef.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.160
Yep.
This is, like, turning to

27:40.160 --> 27:42.329
an even more ancient technology.

27:42.329 --> 27:44.456
This is turning to the fuckin' potato.

27:47.417 --> 27:50.337
<i>I have now come to a place where</i>

27:50.337 --> 27:52.339
we need to eat less meat,

27:52.339 --> 27:54.550
it needs to be something
that should be celebrated over,

27:54.550 --> 27:56.802
<i>that is coming from people</i>

27:56.802 --> 27:59.096
<i>that are growing it the right way.</i>

27:59.096 --> 28:01.223
<i>But also, there's a lot of
things that are delicious</i>

28:01.223 --> 28:02.808
<i>that are not meat.</i>

28:02.808 --> 28:05.227
<i>We just need to be open to change</i>

28:05.227 --> 28:06.895
<i>and open to deliciousness</i>

28:06.895 --> 28:08.397
<i>and open to what else is out there.</i>

28:09.273 --> 28:10.607
Double‐double.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.651
Dave's already opened

28:12.651 --> 28:15.195
a franchise over here.
Yeah, Dave!

28:15.195 --> 28:17.114
Just keep taking bites, Dave.
Ah...

28:18.866 --> 28:21.243
‐ Dave!

28:23.161 --> 28:26.582
This is the Aussie Burger.
It's called a burger with the lot.

28:26.582 --> 28:28.667
Fried egg, Canadian bacon,

28:28.667 --> 28:30.836
beetroot, believe pineapple is in there.

28:30.836 --> 28:32.462
I pissed off all of Australia when I said

28:32.462 --> 28:34.715
they ruined the burger
because of beetroot.

28:34.715 --> 28:36.175
‐ 'Cause of this?
Yeah.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.218
But you can't put beets on a burger.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.678
I wanna try it.

28:39.678 --> 28:41.638
‐ You don't even have to cut it
because no one else...

28:41.638 --> 28:43.307
‐ I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

28:43.307 --> 28:46.560
- DAVID/
Oh! Oh!
