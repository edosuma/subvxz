[Sighs]
God, that was...

00:25.792 --> 00:29.284
- Yeah, that was...
- Amazing.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.322
And a huge mistake.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.561
- Huge.
- Huge.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.569
Why do we keep doing this?

00:37.637 --> 00:41.733
Well, you know, we don't.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.242
I mean, what's it been?

00:44.310 --> 00:46.505
- Twice in the past year?
- Three.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.570
Four if you count that stakeout.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.275
Okay, you know what?
That wasn't sex.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.944
<i>Maybe not for you.</i>
<i>But... this is it.</i>

00:53.019 --> 00:55.078
You know what?
You're right. But, I mean...

00:55.155 --> 00:57.146
it's not like we're
doing anything wrong.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.783
- I mean, you and Drew are...
- <i>We needed to take a break.</i>

00:59.859 --> 01:03.852

But, um, this isn't helping.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.421

- Done.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.537

Address.

Hey, you know, I, uh...

01:21.281 --> 01:24.114
Oh, no, no. Me too. I have to
pick up Parker from school.

01:24.184 --> 01:27.642
Oh, you know what? Make sure that you
bring him the comic that I got him.

Oh, hi.
It's Dr. Brennan.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.162

01:42.235 --> 01:46.001
Uh, available?
Yeah, Dr. Brennan. I...

01:46.072 --> 01:48.165
- Yeah, Bones. What's up?
- Nothing.

01:48.241 --> 01:52.075
Just seeing if you got the call and if you
were swinging by to pick me up or...

01:52.145 --> 01:55.546
Oh, yeah. Um, I'm just gonna have to
meet you there, okay?

01:55.615 --> 01:57.378
Okay, bye.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.411
You don't, uh,

02:03.490 --> 02:06.254
No. No, we have a child together.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.227
- It's perfectly normal for us to...
to be together.
- Right.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.729
- It's not like this is ever gonna happen again.
- No.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.393
Exactly. Okay, um, are you done
with the bathroom?

02:15.468 --> 02:17.163
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.707
- [Siren Wails]
- You're clear!

02:25.512 --> 02:28.447
Sorry if I interrupted anything.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.177
What?
Oh! No.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.549
- No, you didn't.
- Good.

02:33.620 --> 02:37.454
Okay. But if you must know,
you know, Rebecca, my ex...

02:37.524 --> 02:40.891
she stopped by my place
to pick up a comic that I got Parker.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.724
- Okay.
- She just so happened to pick up the phone.

02:43.796 --> 02:46.128
That's it. You know?
Nothing more, nothing less.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.895

03:07.020 --> 03:11.047

a composite of domestic corrosives.

03:11.124 --> 03:14.890
- It smells more like, uh...
- Common drain declogger, acid wash, bleach.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.122
<i>Submerged two to three days.</i>

03:17.197 --> 03:20.223
All right, are you saying that he's been here
all weekend just dissolving?

03:20.300 --> 03:24.862
Allowing the killer time
for the corrosives to do their thing.

<i>[Man] Excuse me.</i>
<i>Can I get in here, please?</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:30.942
- Yeah, I'm Pete Valero.
I'm the development contractor.
- Okay.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.501
- Yeah. I came as soon as...
- [Bubbling]

03:33.580 --> 03:35.946
- [Vomits]
- There could be evidence in there.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.279
I'd say most of it's right in there.

03:38.351 --> 03:41.787
I'll need Zack to help me extract the remains
and whatever else is beneath the surface.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.823
- Wouldn't it be a lot easier
if we took the whole tub?
- <i>No, no, no, wait.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:47.519
That tub is a... is a Godiva 3000.
These things aren't cheap.

03:47.594 --> 03:51.223
<i>Oh, do you think anybody is actually gonna</i>
<i>want this Godiva 3000 after this?</i>

03:51.297 --> 03:54.198
- Well, would they have to know?
- [Scoffs]

03:54.267 --> 03:56.201
Look, I'm just saying,
with subsidized housing...

03:56.269 --> 03:58.203
- the government wants
every nickel accounted for.
- <i>I'll get you a receipt...</i>

03:58.271 --> 04:01.468
if you can tell me why the boss of the job
is just showing up right now.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.704

- It's only skin.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.815
- Oh, this is gonna be fun.
- I should get my video camera.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.383
- [Angela] I may need a Compazine.
- <i>There'll be none of that.</i>

05:28.461 --> 05:31.396
No fun, no video, no vomit. Ooh!

05:31.464 --> 05:33.557
- Then again...
- <i>[Brennan] We have to hurry.</i>

05:33.633 --> 05:35.828
Those chemicals are
eating away at our victim.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.666
<i>Is there any chance that</i>
<i>he was put in there alive?</i>

05:38.738 --> 05:41.901
If we find any rope or duct tape on the body,
I'd say there's a good chance.

05:41.974 --> 05:45.307
<i>Okay, people. Let's start with the who.</i>
<i>We'll worry about the why and the how later.</i>

05:45.378 --> 05:48.074
But if we find the why
and the how first, we'll gladly take it.

05:48.147 --> 05:49.876
Though "who" is
clearly the priority.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.974
The who is not going to change.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.952
<i>But the clues might</i>
<i>if we don't hurry.</i>

05:55.021 --> 05:59.321
- What's our starting weight, Zack?
- Starting weight is 542.13.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.054
The tub itself weighs
about 200 pounds.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.062
Capacity is 34 gallons.

06:04.130 --> 06:08.590
Which at about 8.3 pounds
a gallon comes to 270, 275.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.034
And two-thirds full
makes it about 180...

06:11.104 --> 06:14.005
putting this guy somewhere
in the 160-pound weight class.

06:14.073 --> 06:18.407
The cream always rises.
Or in this case, melted body fat.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.572
I'll measure its volume
to determine body type.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.343
I'll start separating all things
chemical from organic.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.147
<i>And I know you requested</i>
<i>a strainer of some sort, Dr. Brennan...</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:29.154
but I thought this could be of use.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.156
For the big pieces maybe.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.988
After that, old MacZacky,
get on the horn with the coroner's office...

06:34.060 --> 06:37.518
<i>and tell them I want two field unit</i>
<i>water sifters sent here A.S.A.P.</i>

06:37.597 --> 06:40.498
- They get mad when I drop your name.
- Then drop it twice.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.135
Talk about the proof in the pudding.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.501
Oh, even for me, this is disgusting.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.130
Was this too much even for Booth?

06:48.207 --> 06:51.472
He's still questioning
the workers at the site.

06:51.544 --> 06:56.208
Hopefully, there's enough
skull here for a partial reconstruction.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.807
Hmm. I've worked with less.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.020
Right femur's pitted and brittle.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.353
<i>Marrow's practically gelatinized.</i>

07:05.425 --> 07:07.985
- Our victim's elderly.
- Well, that's a bit of a leap.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.893
Well, not really.
Zack, hold still.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.834
It's a hip replacement.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.963
Don't these things usually come
engraved with serial numbers?

07:20.039 --> 07:21.939
Uh, not this one.

07:22.008 --> 07:24.875
It looks like the chemicals
burned those off too.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.254
Hey, so where is Mr. Tub o' Lard?

07:36.322 --> 07:38.256
<i>I figured they'd bring him here.</i>

07:38.324 --> 07:42.055
Lard I've got plenty of. The rest of him's
in the "ookey" room where he belongs.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.063
Oh! Wow, so then that
nasty yellow goop is...

07:45.131 --> 07:47.827
<i>Fat. 9.3 liters so far.</i>

07:47.900 --> 07:50.528
Oh, good. Booth, I'm sure
you'll want to see this too.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.668
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Guess?

07:54.740 --> 07:57.368
- Maybe not, Zack.
- It's our victim's wallet.

07:57.443 --> 07:59.502
Can you believe it?
Leather, cash, cards...

07:59.579 --> 08:02.707
every shred of identification
completely emulsified.

08:02.782 --> 08:06.741
Mmm, wow. You know what, Zack?
I'd like to go back to the old arrangement...

08:06.819 --> 08:08.878
where you don't talk
to me directly, okay?

08:08.955 --> 08:11.253
<i>Have my water sifters arrived yet?</i>

08:11.324 --> 08:14.384
- Yes. That's how I found the wallet.
- Okay, so the point of this is?

08:14.460 --> 08:18.726
Doing what that wallet can't.
Right now, I'd say our victim's an ectomorph.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.266
Thin, linear, narrow features.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.234
And I hear you're back with your ex.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.701
- I'm sorry?
- Rebecca, right?

08:27.773 --> 08:30.037
- Reliving old times?
- [Chuckles]

08:33.279 --> 08:35.212
Uh, I'll just keep sifting.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.477
- Yeah. Dr. Brennan told you?
- Oh, relax.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.815
- She did, didn't she?
- We all have our weak moments.

08:40.886 --> 08:44.721
No. Mm-mmm.
We don't, okay?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.724
- I don't.
- Please, Seeley.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.818
Like we haven't shared enough
of them for me to know better.

08:52.298 --> 08:54.391
- <i>[Brennan] I was not gossiping.</i>
- Oh, really?

08:54.467 --> 08:56.401
So then what would you call it?

08:56.469 --> 08:59.131
- Merely sharing a point of interest.
- Great. So now what am I, huh?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.765
- The world's largest ball of string?
- Not you, your behavior.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.002
It was a textbook example
of just how helpless...

09:04.076 --> 09:06.442
we higher primates can be
to our biological urges.

09:06.512 --> 09:10.073
- I am not helpless.
- [Sighs]

09:10.149 --> 09:12.811
- He's not elderly.
- I can control my, uh...

09:12.885 --> 09:14.819
- Who?
- Our victim.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.855
You see these marrow cells?

09:16.923 --> 09:20.654
The lack of collagen indicates
osteogenesis imperfecta.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.660
Brittle bone disease.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.322
And that's supposed to
tell me that he's not... old?

09:25.398 --> 09:28.492
Not necessarily. And if you're not helpless,
then why did you sleep with her?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.627
Oh, I really don't
recall saying that I did.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.694
You didn't have to.
I could hear it in your voice.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.706
I may as well have walked
in on you having sex.

09:34.774 --> 09:38.005
- You didn't and we weren't.
- Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of, Booth.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.478
<i>Humans act upon a hierarchy of needs,</i>
<i>and sex is very highly ranked.</i>

09:41.547 --> 09:43.845
- It's an anthropological inevitability.
- <i>Thank you, Bones.</i>

09:43.916 --> 09:47.875
I really appreciate you boiling me down
to your anthropological inevitabilities.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.683
- Sure.
- Anytime.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.282
You know, if our victim had brittle bone,
there could be a Web site of some kind.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.293
He might have been listed.

09:55.361 --> 09:58.853
[Angela]
Afraid not, honey.
There's no official database.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.059
But I did track down eight cases
of brittle bone in the area.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.068
<i>How many of them are adult males?</i>

10:04.136 --> 10:06.070
<i>Give me a second.</i>
<i>[Typing]</i>

10:09.208 --> 10:11.301
What's wrong?

10:11.377 --> 10:13.345
With what?

10:13.412 --> 10:17.178
This is usually where I type and you talk.
You two are never not talking.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.149
Well, we're not not talking.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.210
Or maybe we're not not... not.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.256
Okeydoke.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.314
Number of adult males with brittle bone...

10:26.392 --> 10:28.417
in the metropolitan area is...

10:28.494 --> 10:31.691
<i>zero... same with adult females.</i>

10:31.764 --> 10:34.392
- These are all kids.
- Why is that? High mortality rate?

10:34.467 --> 10:37.903
No. When O.I. is fatal,
it's mainly to infants.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.235
- And only in severe cases.
- So our guy has a mild case.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.332
Type I.
Near normal stature...

10:43.409 --> 10:46.173
<i>fragile bones andjoints,</i>
<i>off-white sclera.</i>

10:46.245 --> 10:49.510
- Is this disease hereditary?
- Mild cases can be.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.278
The more severe forms,
types II and III...

10:52.351 --> 10:54.581
are often the result
of a genetic mutation.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.112
But if our guy is type I and these kids
got it passed on from a parent...

10:58.190 --> 11:00.886
Then all we have to do is
contact these kids' families...

11:00.960 --> 11:03.360
and find out which one
is missing a dad.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.956
- Well, let me print you the list.
- Print two.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.967

11:23.716 --> 11:25.843
working in collaboration
with the F.B.I.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.716
The F.B. I?
Is this to do with Larry?

11:28.788 --> 11:31.450
That would be your husband,
Lawrence Seaver?

11:31.524 --> 11:35.858
- Raymond's father?
- He hasn't answered his cell phone in days.

11:35.928 --> 11:38.988
I've left so many messages.
Please come in.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.897
- <i>[Woman On TV] Meerkats form...</i>
- Ray, honey.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.903
- We have company.
- Who's she?

11:45.971 --> 11:48.963
- Did they find Daddy?
- My name is Temperance, Ray.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.441
And I'm just here
to ask a few questions.

11:53.012 --> 11:56.311
- Your husband's been missing since...
- <i>Thursday.</i>

11:56.382 --> 12:00.341
We didn't think of him as missing. He left
on his business trip like he does every week.

12:00.419 --> 12:02.819
But he never fails
to at least call us back.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.847
- That must've hurt.
- Not so much. I'm used to it.

12:06.926 --> 12:10.794
Ray has brittle bone.
It's just a mild form, though, like Larry's.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.923
- You think I could sign your cast?
- Sure. I'll get a pen.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.503
Mrs. Seaver, I need
to borrow this photo.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.441
Okay. Why?

12:24.510 --> 12:27.707
Well, we found a body.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.681
Oh, God.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.311
Sorry I couldn't do more.

12:35.387 --> 12:38.413
Skullcap was falling apart
faster than I could put a face on it.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.619
I'm not sure we'd have a match
either way with so little to work with.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.992
Okay, here we go.
Got our guy.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.997
- What?
- Mother and her daughter up in Maryland.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.999
Dad missing since Thursday.

12:49.802 --> 12:54.136
- Who's that?
- Mother and son down in Virginia.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.572
<i>Father missing since Thursday.</i>

12:56.642 --> 13:00.874
<i>Whoa. Mine's Lawrence Turner, 35,</i>
<i>commercial electrician.</i>

13:00.946 --> 13:03.915
- Oh...
- And I've got Lawrence Seaver, 35.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.474
- my...
- Commercial electrician.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.851
- God.
- I think old Larry's got two wives.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.823
More like two lives.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.764
Just make sureJenny takes her meds.

13:23.836 --> 13:26.327
And tell her Mommy
will see her in the morning.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.497
<i>Thanks, Betty.</i>

13:31.210 --> 13:35.146
- How old's your daughter?
- Six and a half.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.512
She and Larry,
they have a special bond.

13:37.583 --> 13:40.950
- Brittle bone.
- You know about that?

13:41.020 --> 13:42.715
She's type I
like your husband?

13:42.788 --> 13:46.224
He's always felt
so guilty about that.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.817
He really dotes on her,
on both of us.

13:48.894 --> 13:52.557
<i>Mrs. Turner, your husband</i>
<i>ever talk about any conflicts at work?</i>

13:52.631 --> 13:55.725
Never.
Everyone loves Larry.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.770
He's fun, smart, hardworking.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.102
<i>That's what keeps him</i>
<i>out of town so much.</i>

14:01.173 --> 14:03.107
Yeah, about that...

14:03.175 --> 14:07.077
I didn't realize electricians were called upon
to be away from home so much.

14:07.146 --> 14:11.105
There's just so much underbidding.
And it's not like we can get by on what I make.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.710
- As?
- I teach. Eighth-grade science.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.915
- Got it.
- So he has to travel.

14:17.990 --> 14:22.086
- <i>Go where the money is.</i>
<i>Not that he ever complains.</i>
- [Clears Throat]

14:22.161 --> 14:26.291
<i>It makes coming home to us</i>
<i>all the more sweeter, he says.</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:29.459
<i>Oh, God!</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

14:29.535 --> 14:32.834
Will you just excuse me
for one moment.

14:32.905 --> 14:35.100
I'm so sorry.
[Clears Throat]

14:41.180 --> 14:43.307
These women have to know
the truth about their husbands.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.179
- They could be in cahoots.
- Cahoots?

14:45.251 --> 14:48.743
If they somehow found out that Larry was
two-timing them, they could both want him dead.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.346
- Okay, so what now? We ask them?
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.414
It's all taken care of.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.327
Mrs. Turner, could you please
come with me?

14:58.397 --> 15:01.264
Right this way. Just wait here
in the visitors' lounge.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.427
We won't be long. Help yourself
to a cup of coffee.

15:04.503 --> 15:07.097
Thank you.

15:07.172 --> 15:09.663
- That's the interrogation room.
- Not tonight.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.013
Hmm, nice touch
with the kitty posters.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.109
- Who are you talking to?
- That couple in there.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.552
<i>Agent Curry and Moran.</i>
<i>They set up the room.</i>

15:23.622 --> 15:25.954
I'll never drink
F.B.I. coffee again.

15:26.025 --> 15:29.153
- <i>[Phone Beeps]</i>
- Whenever you're ready, Charlie.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.733
You know, I almost
married her, you know?

15:36.568 --> 15:40.527
- Agent Curry?
- Rebecca. My ex.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.870
Oh. You can talk about her now.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.967
Yeah, she got pregnant.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.877
I wanted to do the right thing,
but, you know, she said no.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.178
You've told me this before.
Not that you've ever said why.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.309
Well, issues with my job.

15:53.385 --> 15:56.877
She wanted to start her own career.
She wanted to finish graduate school.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.651
Alone with a baby?

15:58.724 --> 16:01.750
Logic. Right?
You're applying logic?

16:01.827 --> 16:05.763
- Do you still love her?
- Not... like I did. Not like that.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.389
Then why can't it just be sex?

16:07.466 --> 16:10.264
There's nothing "just"
about sex, Bones.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.270
But all mammals need it.

16:12.338 --> 16:15.830
That release of serotonin.
The rush of endorphins.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.844
Naturally, you seek it with
someone with whom you share a sexual rapport.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.903
Rapport, right.
That's the word.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.915
I know when I'm in need
of a release...

16:23.983 --> 16:27.851
there's a former partner or two
I'm... sure I could call.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.514
Okay, Bones. Thanks so much.
I feel so much better now, huh?

16:30.589 --> 16:32.580
Here we go.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.626
[Over Speaker]
Help yourself to coffee, Mrs. Seaver.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.600
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>
<i>Very smart.</i>

16:45.671 --> 16:49.437
Well, it's my job, Bones.
It's, you know, what I do for a living.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.972
They don't seem like...
Wait.

17:00.786 --> 17:04.619
<i>Hmm, they may as well be</i>
<i>in separate rooms.</i>

17:04.690 --> 17:08.490
Making them either great actresses
who are in cahoots...

17:08.560 --> 17:12.758
Or... they have no idea
what's going on.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.396
How could these women not know?

17:20.472 --> 17:22.440
Brennan was pretty sure
that they didn't.

17:22.508 --> 17:25.271
And still don't apparently.
Booth wants to wait to tell them.

17:25.344 --> 17:29.007
- Wait for what? To summon the nerve?
- <i>Maybe.</i>

17:29.081 --> 17:31.311
I just wouldn't want these women
finding out at the funeral.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.647
I'll take a front row seat for that.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.451
Sorry. Did I say that out loud?

17:37.523 --> 17:40.356
Have you found anything resembling
a weapon in the tub yet?

17:40.426 --> 17:42.360
Not yet. Why?

17:42.428 --> 17:44.259
<i>These skull fragments may feel</i>
<i>like wet cardboard...</i>

17:44.329 --> 17:46.422
but I'm pretty sure we're
looking at blunt force trauma.

17:46.498 --> 17:49.126
<i>I'll second that.</i>
<i>Roughly "V"-shaped.</i>

17:49.201 --> 17:50.862
Corner of a 2-by-4 maybe?

17:50.936 --> 17:54.702
Specks of blood at the point of impact.
Could've been the lethal blow.

17:54.773 --> 17:58.607
Making him dead before
he was doused with lye. Oh, happy day.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.872
<i>I've isolated</i>
<i>our corrosive culprits.</i>

18:00.946 --> 18:05.007
Sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite,
and hydrochloric acid.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.212
- Available at your local market.
- Lucky the whole tub didn't explode.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.221
It practically did.
Along with teeth...

18:10.289 --> 18:13.850
I keep finding these
tiny shards of copper from the fixtures.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.656
Is that what this is?

18:16.728 --> 18:19.458
<i>No. That would be a wedding band.</i>

18:19.531 --> 18:21.726
Braided gold and platinum.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.734
Preserved by true love, no doubt.

18:23.802 --> 18:26.396
- One metal for each desperate housewife.
- <i>People...</i>

18:26.472 --> 18:28.303
can we at least fake
some sense of decorum?

18:28.373 --> 18:30.967
<i>I can't help it.</i>
<i>It's so</i> Jerry Springer.

18:31.043 --> 18:34.444
<i>First of all, how does</i>
<i>anyonejuggle two spouses?</i>

18:34.513 --> 18:37.607
<i>I can think of ways. Of course,</i>
<i>byjuggle, I mean quite literally...</i>

18:37.683 --> 18:39.651
I have a scalpel.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.687
Maybe he dissolved himself so there'd
be more of him to go around.

18:42.754 --> 18:45.018
I'm going to hell, aren't I?

18:45.090 --> 18:47.081
I'll save you a seat.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.227
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>Not sweet Mr. Seaver!</i>

18:53.298 --> 18:55.232
- It can't be him.
- Yeah.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.427
Well, um, is that
your boss in there?

18:57.503 --> 19:00.336
I mean, who would do something like that?
Everybody loves the man.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.202
Well, you know, not everyone.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.265
Hey, what's goin' on?

19:04.343 --> 19:06.436
- Mr. Valero, you won't believe it.
- Agent Booth. We met yesterday.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.878
<i>It was Mr. Seaver.</i>
<i>That's who was in the bathtub.</i>

19:08.947 --> 19:11.347
Wait. Larry?
The electrician?

19:11.416 --> 19:14.681
- Yeah. Larry the electrician. Now...
- Son of a bitch!

19:14.753 --> 19:16.778
Now I'm never gonna see my money.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.017
You know, I must say, uh, Pete...

19:23.095 --> 19:26.462
<i>you're the first person I've come across</i>
<i>who's ever had a bad word to say about Larry.</i>

19:26.532 --> 19:29.558
Well, the guy does have
a way with people. Or he did.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.934
- I mean, I liked him too before he got all slippery.
- Slippery?

19:33.005 --> 19:36.532
I fronted the guy 85 grand
to cover electrical supplies.

19:36.608 --> 19:40.772
Last week, I got the inspector walking around,
and she cites me for cheap materials.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.747
Substandard circuit breakers,
insufficient G.F.I.'s.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.477
- Where'd the 85 grand go?
- Exactly what I asked Larry.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.385
"Show me receipts," I said.
What do I get?

19:49.454 --> 19:52.116
<i>Sob stories ofbad bookkeeping...</i>

19:52.191 --> 19:54.125
his son's health,
problems with the wife.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.956
His wife?

19:56.028 --> 19:59.327
Yeah. Like I don't got a wife of my own, right?
[Chuckles]

19:59.398 --> 20:02.265
<i>You know, you realize, Pete,</i>
<i>that everything that you're telling me...</i>

20:02.334 --> 20:05.826
- sounds a lot like motive.
- [Scoffs]

20:05.904 --> 20:07.895
Great.
Do I need a lawyer?

20:07.973 --> 20:10.100
I don't know.
You tell me.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.177
All right, look.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.839
I can't say that I wasn't angry enough
to want the guy dead.

20:15.914 --> 20:19.577
<i>But like always, I fell back on</i>
<i>the old builders' code.</i>

20:19.651 --> 20:22.245
- "Can't squeeze money from the dead man?"
- You know it.

20:22.321 --> 20:25.347
Well, you know, as codes go,
it's hardly limited to builders.

20:25.424 --> 20:28.450
No, no, no. It's our code.
You can look it up.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.119
No, no.
Maybe later.

20:30.195 --> 20:33.858
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
any of Larry's old paperwork on file?

20:33.932 --> 20:36.162
- <i>Accounts? Receipts?</i>
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.897
<i>[Chattering]</i>

20:45.444 --> 20:49.005
<i>I think I've stumbled</i>
<i>upon an anomaly, Dr. Saroyan.</i>

20:49.081 --> 20:51.447
It looks like
a splintered ulna bone.

20:51.516 --> 20:55.384
- <i>But it's not. It's ivory.</i>
- From the tusk of a small elephant?

20:55.454 --> 21:00.551
I was hoping you'd know.
If you notice these indentations here.

21:00.626 --> 21:04.722
Like teeth marks on a pencil.
See what Angela can make of it.

21:04.796 --> 21:08.994
<i>And after that, I'll need you to go back to</i>
<i>the crime scene with the photos I'm taking.</i>

21:09.067 --> 21:12.161
See what you can find with the approximate
shape and dimension of this blunt force wound.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.138
- Like a murder weapon?
- It needn't look like one.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.038
Anything that replicates
this pattern.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.071
- I'm going on police business.
- So proud.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.137
Wait, does he mean out?
In the world?

21:23.215 --> 21:26.082
We'll pin our phone number on his shirt.
What's that you got there?

21:26.151 --> 21:28.551
Well, having finally hit
the very bottom of the tub...

21:28.620 --> 21:33.353
I found it plugged with a ceramic stopper,
which I lifted and voilà.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.791
What do you make of this?

21:36.995 --> 21:39.088
<i>Bones...[Laughs]</i>
<i>are you ready for this?</i>

21:39.164 --> 21:41.223
- Did you tell the wives yet?
- No, not yet.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.064
But I did some checking into
two-time Larry's finances.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.628
Under the last name Seaver, he's got
a half-a-million-dollar life insurance policy.

21:47.706 --> 21:50.504
- Assigning motive to Gayle Seaver.
- Under the last name Turner...

21:50.575 --> 21:53.510
he's got a living will leaving everything
to Lila and their daughter.

21:53.578 --> 21:55.512
- Giving both women motive.
- Right.

21:55.580 --> 21:59.016
Which is just a matter of which one needed
the money more than they needed their Larry.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.552
- I might be able to help.
- With what?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.554
A very small used condom?

22:03.622 --> 22:05.817
It's the finger from a rubber glove.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.553
Hodgins just found it wedged
under the tub's drain stopper.

22:08.627 --> 22:11.187
Oh, it was spared
the corrosive effects of the lye.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.289
<i>Meaning, we may be able</i>
<i>to pull a fingerprint from the inside.</i>

22:14.366 --> 22:16.698
No maybes about it.
If there's a print, I'll pull it.

22:16.768 --> 22:19.965
- And <i>when</i> I pull it...
- We'll have our killer.

22:24.976 --> 22:26.910
It's just standard procedure, Lila.

22:26.978 --> 22:29.970
<i>Just press four fingers</i>
<i>firmly and hold.</i>

22:30.048 --> 22:32.812
Our investigation turned up
a print at the crime scene.

22:32.884 --> 22:37.548
<i>And wejust need yours, Gayle,</i>
<i>to avoid any possible confusion.</i>

22:39.324 --> 22:41.349
<i>This isn't gonna take long, is it?</i>

22:41.426 --> 22:43.690
- Our tech has the print you pulled?
- Ring finger, left hand.

22:43.762 --> 22:45.821
Then this shouldn't take long at all.
Just wait here.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.331
Wait. Are you sure
this is the best time to tell them?

22:48.400 --> 22:50.834
What does that mean? After two days
of nagging me, you're just...

22:50.902 --> 22:52.961
- Now you're getting cold feet?
- What? I do not nag.

22:53.038 --> 22:57.338
Well, you know, it's an anthropological
inevitability for women to gossip and nag.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.434
Can I get anyone a soda?

22:59.511 --> 23:03.072
No, thank you.
Are you on my husband's case too?

23:03.148 --> 23:05.082
No. I don't work here.

23:06.184 --> 23:08.948
You're the lady
from the waiting room.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.580
- <i>You gave me a tissue?</i>
- Oh, yeah.

23:11.656 --> 23:13.590
- <i>That was you?</i>
- Yeah.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.957
- Sorry. I'm a little out of it.
- Yeah. I know how that feels.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.962
Actually, ladies, let me make
some introductions.

23:19.030 --> 23:23.126
Uh, Gayle Seaver,
Lila Turner. Lila, Gayle.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.362
Hi. Lila, that was
very sweet of you. I...

23:25.437 --> 23:27.701
- I'd just lost my husband.
- You did?

23:27.773 --> 23:30.139
<i>So did I.</i>

23:30.208 --> 23:33.268
Actually, that's... why
you're both here really.

23:33.345 --> 23:37.281
Um, for the same reason,
for the same husband.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.784
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah. Me too.

23:40.852 --> 23:45.414
What Agent Booth's trying to say
is that your husbands, Larry...

23:45.490 --> 23:47.890
are the same Larry.

23:47.959 --> 23:51.326
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Uh, this will help.</i>

23:51.396 --> 23:53.921
A little show-and-tell. Um...

23:56.535 --> 23:59.197
Well, this is wrong.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.535
It's a joke.
A sick joke.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.131
- Actually, it's not...
- My Larry would never...

24:04.209 --> 24:06.143
- Your Larry? This is my Larry!
- My Larry!

24:06.211 --> 24:09.237
- He's my husband. What are you talking about?
- Just go ahead and lie like that?

24:09.314 --> 24:14.308
- Bones?
- Okay. Let's sit! Everyone just sit down.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.411
<i>[Lila] This is ridiculous.</i>

24:16.488 --> 24:18.251
Fine.

24:18.323 --> 24:21.053
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:25.324
Booth. Yeah? Yeah, I'm meeting
with them right now.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.491
- <i>Right. The one from the glove.</i>
- I'm sorry. I can't imagine...

24:28.567 --> 24:31.092
- Whose kid is this?
- Whose little girl is that?

24:31.169 --> 24:33.228
Are you sure? Thanks.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.236
- What?
- Um...

24:36.308 --> 24:38.868
<i>The print we found on</i>
<i>the rubber glove at the crime scene...</i>

24:38.944 --> 24:41.344
it doesn't match either wife.

24:41.413 --> 24:44.246
Oh, so it's back to square one.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.716
Are you sure I can't get
anyone a soda?

24:50.822 --> 24:52.756
Hey. Dr. Brennan, right?

24:52.824 --> 24:55.292
- Rebecca, hi.
- Is he in there?

24:55.360 --> 24:58.625
He is.
But it's not a good time.

24:58.697 --> 25:02.428
Not that my powers of discernment
have ever been particularly sharp...

25:02.501 --> 25:04.435
vis-à-vis good times from bad...

25:04.503 --> 25:07.097
but in this instance, it's bad.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.266
And I thought Seeley
was exaggerating about you.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.776
- With regard to...
- Just tell him to give me a call.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.978
Hey.

25:18.049 --> 25:20.040
Can I ask you something?

25:21.286 --> 25:24.084
- Why did you say no?
- Excuse me?

25:24.155 --> 25:27.989
When he asked you to marry him?
I mean, he seems an ideal candidate.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.755
Strong, alpha male,
good protective instincts.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.797
And I should discuss
this with you why?

25:32.864 --> 25:35.298
It's just...

25:35.367 --> 25:39.064
I'm not sure he knows.
And... I think it bothers him.

25:44.843 --> 25:47.038
I've always taken care of myself.

25:47.112 --> 25:49.478
To a fault sometimes.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.381
And when we got pregnant,
Seeley proposed.

25:52.450 --> 25:56.580
But I didn't want to be one of those
women who gets married out of need.

25:56.655 --> 25:59.453
So I said no.

25:59.524 --> 26:02.925
- I can see that.
- By the time that I realized I'd made a mistake...

26:02.994 --> 26:06.395
that I'd still
be the same person...

26:06.464 --> 26:09.490
I think there's a moment
for two people.

26:09.568 --> 26:14.301
A single moment where they
can either catch fire or...

26:15.707 --> 26:19.199
Seeley and I, we missed our moment.

26:19.277 --> 26:21.575
- Do you understand?
- I'm trying.

26:21.646 --> 26:24.843
But the "single moment" thesis
doesn't explain...

26:24.916 --> 26:27.214
Why we still get together.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.776
Fall together really.

26:29.854 --> 26:35.486
Because I think that we just
feel what used to be there.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.494
And we miss it.

26:37.562 --> 26:40.087
I think Booth thinks
you didn't marry him...

26:40.165 --> 26:42.156
because he wouldn't make
a good father.

26:42.233 --> 26:45.293
- What?
- He worries about it himself.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.999
What he does for a living.
His past as a sniper.

26:49.074 --> 26:51.065
Oh, God.

26:54.012 --> 26:57.846
Uh, do me a favor?
Don't tell him that I came by, okay?

26:57.916 --> 26:59.884
Please.

27:09.361 --> 27:13.354
<i>Man, what I would've given to have been</i>
<i>a fly on the wall when you told those wives.</i>

27:13.431 --> 27:15.524
You would've been swatted, trust me.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.058
No match on the prints from
our nationwide database either.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.731
At least we can assume our killer
was a first-time offender.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.865
Great. Thanks, Bones.
That narrows it down.

27:23.942 --> 27:26.342
So I hear you're back with your ex.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.743
- Don't look at me.
- <i>Your son must be thrilled.</i>

27:28.813 --> 27:32.681
I know I may thumb my nose at
the hypocrisy of marriage as a sacred institution.

27:32.751 --> 27:36.778
- <i>But I think a boy truly benefits...</i>
- I am not back with my ex.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.050
Let me finish.
A boy truly benefits...

27:39.124 --> 27:41.092
from knowing where
his parents stand, together or not.

27:41.159 --> 27:45.289
<i>Like I once had this dancer down in Miami</i>
<i>whose stage name was Abbey Road.</i>

27:45.363 --> 27:48.025
- Anyway, she had a kid too, right?
- That'll do, Ringo.

27:48.099 --> 27:51.364
- I think I scored, Dr. Brennan.
- Somebody just kill me right now.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.461
Dr. Saroyan sent me
back to the crime scene.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.701
That's a junction box with
a single brown hair embedded.

27:56.775 --> 28:00.108
- This is at floor level?
- Across from where the bathtub had been.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.976
You'll find its contours
match our trauma wound.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.141
Then let's see if this hair
is a match for Larry.

28:05.216 --> 28:09.050
Before you go, are we sure
these copper bits are from the tub?

28:09.120 --> 28:11.054
I assumed they'd come off
the fixtures.

28:11.122 --> 28:13.283
Yeah, but... but the drain,
the faucet and the spigots...

28:13.358 --> 28:16.623
- <i>they're all pristine outside a scratch or two.</i>
- Wait. Let me see that.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.391
It's bird shot.
Or it was.

28:19.464 --> 28:22.331
It's compressed copper that's frangible
so it breaks apart on impact.

28:22.400 --> 28:26.496
- Could they kill a man?
- I think our vice president
disproved that possibility.

28:26.571 --> 28:29.267
Look, any ammo at
close range will do the job.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.774
But at the very least, a gunshot
would've sent Larry flying...

28:31.843 --> 28:33.902
causing his head to hit
this junction box.

28:33.978 --> 28:36.469
- Which given his condition...
- Would be fatal.

28:42.487 --> 28:45.615
Okay. What you thought
were teeth marks, Dr. Saroyan...

28:45.690 --> 28:48.682
<i>turned out to be Chinese characters</i>
<i>engraved along the side.</i>

28:48.760 --> 28:51.285
- What do they say?
- They say...

28:51.362 --> 28:54.490
"What make foolish man
think I speak Chinese?"

28:54.566 --> 28:56.534
I thought you were half Chinese?

28:56.601 --> 28:59.434
And I think you're half Swedish.
Let's hear some Swedish.

28:59.504 --> 29:02.166
What is it, Angela, please?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.868
It's a chopstick.
Only it's not the kind you eat with.

29:04.943 --> 29:08.344
- There's another kind?
- Well, you wouldn't comb your hair
with a fork, would you?

29:08.413 --> 29:10.847
- My hair?
- All right, look.

29:10.915 --> 29:14.214
The one character that
I was able to translate off the Internet...

29:14.285 --> 29:17.152
is the word "beauty,"
and I realized it's meant for hair.

29:17.222 --> 29:20.885
<i>Where you twist it in a bun</i>
<i>and stick this through to hold it in place?</i>

29:20.959 --> 29:24.986
But if that's what this is,
we can be pretty sure it wasn't Larry's.

29:26.865 --> 29:30.961
<i>Thanks. Roommate says she went to go meet</i>
<i>some friends at the Beltway Burger.</i>

29:31.035 --> 29:33.299
And you think
it's this Chloe girl because...

29:33.371 --> 29:36.363
Of the chopsticks, right?
As soon as Cam said it, I knew it.

29:36.441 --> 29:39.467
Because when I went to go see Pete,
she had chopsticks in the back of her hair.

29:39.544 --> 29:42.012
- And how did Hodgins find out?
- I'm sorry?

29:42.080 --> 29:44.708
- "Yeah, I hear you're back with your ex."
- I don't know.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.082
I assume it was Cam. I was only trying
to engage her in social intercourse.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.519
- Excuse me?
- Just trying to be normal.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.216
Congenial exchange with a coworker.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.418
And if that's what gossip is,
I don't like it at all.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.859
Yeah, you think you don't like it?
I can't stand...

29:57.929 --> 30:00.693
There it is. Beltway Burger.

Oh, hi!
You're that F.B.I. guy!

30:25.990 --> 30:27.958
Yes, I'm the F.B.I. guy.

30:28.026 --> 30:30.927
So you worship at the temple
of Beltway Burger too, huh?

30:30.995 --> 30:34.192
- Yeah, on occasion.
- Yeah, I may be 90% vegetarian...

30:34.265 --> 30:36.790
but their burgers...
can't get enough of'em lately.

30:36.868 --> 30:40.235
- How many weeks are you?
- Excuse me?

30:40.305 --> 30:43.103
Pregnant. I could tell by your gait.

<i>Your ilia... they've already started</i>
<i>shifting to widen the birth canal.</i>

30:47.145 --> 30:49.477

Fourteen weeks.

31:14.472 --> 31:17.737
There's a playground about
halfway between Gayle and me...

31:17.809 --> 31:19.743
designed for kids
with special needs.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.575
Rubber surfacing, high-back swings.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.878
I took Ray there last week,
and Lila was there with Jenny.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.043
The kids started playing.
We started talking.

31:28.119 --> 31:31.350
- And one topic led to another.
- And... small world.

31:31.422 --> 31:34.755
- Yeah, too small.
- What about Chloe?

31:34.826 --> 31:39.661
Well, after we got over the initial shock,
like yesterday but real...

31:39.731 --> 31:42.928
we decided to follow Larry
to work the next morning...

31:43.001 --> 31:44.798
straight to a motel
where Chloe was waiting.

31:44.869 --> 31:47.565
<i>And if that wasn't enough to</i>
<i>make our heads explode...</i>

31:47.639 --> 31:50.870
we then had to find out
about Chloe's... condition.

31:50.942 --> 31:53.775
At which point, you knew it was
time to confront Larry.

31:53.845 --> 31:57.337
- I had no idea that Larry was married.
- Let alone twice.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.282
But since your prints match the one
left in the rubber glove...

32:00.351 --> 32:02.478
we assume it wasn't long
before you found out.

32:02.553 --> 32:04.851
We checked your
phone records, Gayle, and, uh...

32:04.923 --> 32:08.290
<i>you didn't leave Larry any</i>
<i>messages after Friday night.</i>

32:08.359 --> 32:10.554
The night you, Lila, and Chloe...

32:10.628 --> 32:13.688
told him you were going to
see him together to get answers.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.030
So you found Larry at his job.
You shot him point-blank.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.831
<i>And you dragged his sorry ass</i>
<i>back to the bathtub.</i>

32:19.904 --> 32:23.533
Where you doused him in
sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite.

32:23.608 --> 32:27.738
Or as you and I like to call 'em,
bleach and Quickie Plumber.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.042
Which, as an eighth-grade teacher,
you knew would do the trick.

32:30.114 --> 32:33.811
- Simple earth science.
- Look, all that's true. But we didn't kill him.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.376
- Really? Then who did?
- He killed himself.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.388
- He killed himself.
- He killed himself.

32:39.824 --> 32:42.258
Larry was dead when you got there?

32:42.327 --> 32:44.522
- On the bathroom floor.
- The gun was still in his mouth.

32:44.595 --> 32:47.257
The coward must've freaked at the thought
of facing us together.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.095
If we'd surprised him,
maybe he'd still be alive.

32:49.167 --> 32:53.263
<i>Back up. You're saying</i>
<i>that the gun was still in his mouth?</i>

32:53.338 --> 32:55.863
His finger was on the trigger.
It was awful.

32:55.940 --> 32:58.704
And where's the gun now?

32:58.776 --> 33:01.210
I buried it in my backyard.

33:01.279 --> 33:03.372
That's a good place for it.

33:07.418 --> 33:09.010
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, you got that right.

33:09.087 --> 33:10.748
- You know what? They're lying.
- How do you know?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.551
Oh, come on. They've been
lying since day one.

33:12.623 --> 33:15.057
Between all of them, they should have
a dozen Oscars by now.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.356
- I know what those are.
- I mean, come on. Suicide? Mm-mmm.

33:17.428 --> 33:19.658
Bird shot or not, okay,
every self-inflicted I've seen...

33:19.731 --> 33:21.665
the guy shoots himself,
and he drops the gun.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.826
Right? It's an automatic reaction.
Bang, drop.

33:23.901 --> 33:25.960
There's no way the gun
ends up in his mouth.

33:26.037 --> 33:28.130
Then we'd better go dig up that gun.

33:28.206 --> 33:31.334
- Seeley?
- I'll get the ball rolling.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.709
- Was that Dr. Brennan?
- Uh-huh.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.714
Why are you here?

33:37.782 --> 33:40.910
I needed to know if you were gonna
coach Parker's T-ball team this year.

33:40.985 --> 33:43.920
- You know I always coach Parker's T-ball team.
- I didn't wanna assume...

33:43.988 --> 33:46.786
Okay, whoa. What is going
on here, Rebecca? Okay?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.792
Because, look,
I thought we agreed here.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.829
We cannot end up groping each other
in the F.B.I. closet.

33:51.896 --> 33:54.490
We can't do that.
We're done.

33:54.565 --> 33:58.092
- I know.
- Really?

33:58.169 --> 34:02.299
Seeley, all the excuses
I gave you for not wanting to get married...

34:02.373 --> 34:05.069
- my independence, your work...
- I know.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.134
No, you don't.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.908
You are a wonderful father.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.353
And Parker is a lucky kid.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.856
Such a lucky kid.

34:21.559 --> 34:25.859
And obviously, we still have
feelings for each other.

34:29.266 --> 34:31.667
Do you still wanna marry me?

34:33.036 --> 34:34.971
Rebecca...

34:36.774 --> 34:39.174
No, I don't.

34:41.212 --> 34:43.179
I don't wanna marry you either.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.853
Here are the forms for T-ball.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.956
- I'll miss you.
- Yeah.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.120
And I'm gonna miss you too.

34:58.196 --> 35:01.063
You know what I'm gonna
miss the most?

35:02.934 --> 35:05.129
Yeah. But let's not go there.

35:20.551 --> 35:22.644
<i>Okay. DNA on the barrel...</i>

35:22.720 --> 35:25.280
confirms it was in
Larry's mouth at some point.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.290
Yeah. Well, I still don't buy it.

35:27.358 --> 35:29.485
You know, the kickback alone
would've forced it out.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.926
Unless he was dead before the shot.

35:31.996 --> 35:34.760
Well, yeah, that's true.
But, uh...

35:34.832 --> 35:38.495
- Wait, what?
- The inside of Larry's skull is pitted...

35:38.569 --> 35:41.231
which I had always attributed
to the effects of the lye.

35:41.305 --> 35:44.741
But each tiny hole matches
perfectly with the bird shot...

35:44.809 --> 35:46.674
right down to these
specks of copper.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.439
Are you saying that it was suicide?

35:48.513 --> 35:52.176
I would, except these holes
are void of blood...

35:52.250 --> 35:56.380
which would suggest they were inflicted after
blood stopped pumping trough Larry's head.

35:56.454 --> 35:58.388
No, keep talking.
I'll catch up.

35:58.456 --> 36:02.290
Well, unlike this blunt force trauma...
no shortage of blood here.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.591
Proving he was dead
before he was shot.

36:05.663 --> 36:10.896
So now we're talking about
a faked homicide to cover up a faked suicide?

36:10.968 --> 36:14.734
A faked suicide meant to cover up
an actual, original murder.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.706
Now, just when you think things
couldn't get any more twisted...

36:17.775 --> 36:20.209
- How's this for a curveball?
- In walks Cam.

36:20.278 --> 36:24.237
After retrieving and reassembling
every tooth from that tub...

36:24.315 --> 36:26.146
<i>I now discover I had one extra.</i>

36:26.217 --> 36:28.048
Well, this is not a tooth.
It's a crown.

36:28.119 --> 36:31.247
Exactly. Any of your women
happen to be missing one?

36:31.322 --> 36:34.485
- Not that I could see.
- Well, it wouldn't be theirs anyway.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.221
- It's sized for a man.
- I knew that.

36:37.295 --> 36:39.456
A man's tooth, and it's not Larry's.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.464
It's not a tooth.
It's a crown...

36:41.532 --> 36:43.830
whereby a dentist files down
an existing tooth...

36:43.901 --> 36:46.734
I know what a crown is, Bones.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.232
Except Pete called it a root canal.

36:51.309 --> 36:53.504
Pete.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.774
[Man]
Yeah, right there.

36:59.850 --> 37:02.318
Well, look who's here.
Returning to the scene of the crime.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.081
Funny. I was gonna say that to you.

37:04.155 --> 37:06.146
- Okay, boys, that's lunch. Let's go.
- All right.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.590
Why? No, no.
I'm talking about that.

37:08.659 --> 37:11.457
- <i>Look at my wall there. Who's gonna pay for that?</i>
- Let's find out.

37:11.529 --> 37:14.157
- Smile for me, Pete.
- Whoa! Back off! What's this about?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.826
Temporary crown,
maxillary central incisor.

37:16.901 --> 37:20.132
- Turn around, Pete.
- Like I have the slightest idea
how Larry got in that tub?

37:20.204 --> 37:22.468
Actually, on that detail,
we're quite sure you don't.

37:22.540 --> 37:26.340
Making that look on your face
when you saw it all the more priceless.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.037
That's because I didn't
know what happened...

37:28.112 --> 37:30.444
Well, let me tell you
what I know, Pete. Okay?

37:30.514 --> 37:32.641
<i>I know Larry owed you 85 grand.</i>
<i>So Friday night...</i>

37:32.717 --> 37:35.185
<i>you come here to have</i>
<i>a little talk to him about it.</i>

37:35.253 --> 37:38.984
And about the same time, he gets a phone call
from his very unhappy wives.

37:39.056 --> 37:42.219
- Wives?
- Yeah. Which puts Larry in a really bad place.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.784
<i>So when you asked him,</i>
<i>"Hey, you know, where's my money?"</i>

37:44.862 --> 37:48.354
- He pretty much blows you off.
- Like he has more important things
to worry about.

37:48.432 --> 37:52.698
<i>Bad enough that Larry rips you off,</i>
<i>but he disrespects you on top of it?</i>

37:52.770 --> 37:55.637
- <i>That's not gonna happen in this lifetime.</i>
- <i>So it got physical.</i>

37:55.706 --> 37:59.403
Larry knocked your crown loose.
And you shoved him down here...

37:59.477 --> 38:02.378
<i>where he hit his head</i>
<i>on the socket casing.</i>

38:02.446 --> 38:06.007
I... I... I swear he didn't land hard.

38:06.083 --> 38:10.144
With his O.I. condition, it didn't matter.
Wouldn't take much.

38:10.221 --> 38:12.849
It was an accident.
I'm sorry.

38:12.923 --> 38:15.016
So sorry you had to cover it up?

38:15.092 --> 38:17.356
Stick a cheap shotgun in
his mouth, pull the trigger...

38:17.428 --> 38:19.089
and make manslaughter
look like suicide.

38:19.163 --> 38:22.758
The guy had ripped me off for enough.
I couldn't let him ruin me too.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.824
And you can live with that?

38:24.902 --> 38:27.427
A person can live with anything
if they don't think too hard.

38:27.505 --> 38:30.838
<i>Let's try this again, Pete.</i>
<i>Turn around.</i>

38:30.908 --> 38:34.036
How did he get in the tub?
It's been driving me nuts.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.045
You know what?

38:36.113 --> 38:38.445
- Try not to think about it.
- [Booth] Come on.

38:39.617 --> 38:42.711
<i>The irony is that I cannot</i>
<i>think of a single woman...</i>

38:42.787 --> 38:45.017
who would want three husbands.

38:45.089 --> 38:48.456
<i>[Hodgins] Good thing. A guy would never</i>
<i>be stupid enough to let it happen.</i>

38:48.526 --> 38:51.518
Excuse me.
These women were not stupid.

38:51.595 --> 38:54.063
And that is completely gross.

38:54.131 --> 38:56.065
But <i>comfy.</i>

38:56.133 --> 38:58.601
- Welcome back by the way.
- What?

38:58.669 --> 39:00.694
<i>Well, after two days of</i>
<i>inappropriate comments...</i>

39:00.771 --> 39:03.399
you're back to judging me
for gross behavior.

39:03.474 --> 39:06.500
- When am I ever appropriate?
- Good point.

39:06.577 --> 39:09.375
Maybe it was just
the judging me I missed.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.312
Ah, the woman
I know and love...

39:12.950 --> 39:17.444
in a purely nonromantic,
happy-to-be-judged way.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.887
Well...

39:19.957 --> 39:21.481
- Anyway.
- These women.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.754
Right. Not stupid.

39:23.828 --> 39:27.355
And frankly, that they allowed
themselves to be duped...

39:27.431 --> 39:29.899
is a sad statement on how
lean the market is out there.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.798
I resent that.
I'm out there.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.632
You certainly are.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.831
Well, how not stupid could
these women have been...

39:35.906 --> 39:38.306
to think that they could
get away with faking a murder?

39:38.376 --> 39:42.005
Or how compassionate were they to recognize
that they were all in the same boat.

39:42.079 --> 39:44.513
So why let Larry take his
insurance money with him?

39:44.582 --> 39:47.642
Yeah. A lot a good
it'll do 'em in jail.

39:50.554 --> 39:53.853
So you never said how
it ended up with Rebecca.

39:53.924 --> 39:57.485
Well, yeah, it ended. The only time
we'll ever spend together is with Parker.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.756
- You sure that's what you want?
- You know what, Bones?

39:59.830 --> 40:02.128
It might be all
anthropology to you...

40:02.199 --> 40:04.827
but there are certain people
that you just can't sleep with.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.029
<i>I mean, you can pretend</i>
<i>that it's just sex.</i>

40:07.104 --> 40:09.834
<i>You can lie to yourself,</i>
<i>and you can say that it's all good.</i>

40:09.907 --> 40:13.741
But, um, there's just...
There's too many strings and...

40:13.811 --> 40:16.803
and too much at stake, you know?

40:16.881 --> 40:19.543
Too much too lose.

40:20.651 --> 40:23.779
Yeah.
I can see that.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.520
It's over, you know?

40:28.592 --> 40:30.651
I appreciate, you know,
your support in that.

40:32.062 --> 40:35.088
I will.
And if you should slip...

40:35.166 --> 40:38.897
I will... keep my mouth
shut about it.

40:38.969 --> 40:42.496
Thank you.
But, I mean, it's not like I'm gonna...

40:42.573 --> 40:44.507
No, I mean with anybody.

40:44.575 --> 40:49.638
I'm sure Rebecca's not your only option
for satisfying biological urges.

40:54.952 --> 40:58.353
<i>Please tell me these women</i>
<i>are not going tojail.</i>

40:58.422 --> 41:02.415
<i>Trying to bilk the insurance system,</i>
<i>they'll get nothing less than a firing squad.</i>

41:02.493 --> 41:06.190
- Not if they never filed a claim.
- Because our friends here caught them.

41:06.263 --> 41:09.164
Well, you're both kinda right.
Given their kids and the circumstances...

41:09.233 --> 41:12.566
the D.A. is gonna offer
probation provided that...

41:12.636 --> 41:15.537
<i>all three women show remorse</i>
<i>and attend mandatory counseling.</i>

41:15.606 --> 41:18.507
<i>In exchange for movie rights I hope.</i>

41:18.576 --> 41:20.908
- You know they're gonna get calls.
- I hope so.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.339
Hey, nice going by the way.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.782
- Cam tells me you're back with your ex.
- Cam?

41:27.852 --> 41:29.843
Mmm.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.684
Cam in her office?

41:32.756 --> 41:35.987
[Inhales]
I said something wrong.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.654
Ooh, would it be gossip
if I told you?

41:38.729 --> 41:41.289
I hope so.

41:41.365 --> 41:43.595
- <i># [Blues]</i>
- <i>[Giggling, Laughing]</i>

42:00.784 --> 42:04.743
Wow.
That was, uh...

42:04.822 --> 42:07.154
That was...

42:07.224 --> 42:09.784
- Wicked?
- Yeah.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.591
- And a huge mistake.
- Not if we don't do it again.

42:13.664 --> 42:16.292
- Deal.
- Deal.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.301
Not after tonight I mean.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.304
- Never again.
- No.
