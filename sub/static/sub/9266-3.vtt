WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:03.919
Pack up your stuff. Starting tomorrow,
you're gonna go to East Dillon High.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.214
- Kind of looking for a place.
- I do have this trailer.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.300
I'm gonna give my daughter a call.

00:10.327 --> 00:11.510
Don't you scare her!

00:14.389 --> 00:15.640
I'm your new intern.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.309
I've got a bunch of crap in here,
I need you to start moving it.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.645
Why did you forfeit the game?
You just quit on us?

00:20.813 --> 00:23.022
I've got shame
and I apologize to you.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.232
Who wants to finish this fight?

00:25.699 --> 00:28.069
Let's finish it!
Let's finish it!

00:39.850 --> 00:40.950
Hey, listen!

00:41.166 --> 00:43.834
Ten of you are gonna push the car.
Once we get out there,

00:44.002 --> 00:46.189
the rest of you hold the helmets
and collect the money.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.506
Be careful, don't get
your feet run over.

00:49.033 --> 00:51.008
- Any questions?
- Matter of fact, I do.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.427
- What is it, Tinker?
- Why are we pushing this damn car?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.012
One, watch your language.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.349
Two, next time, I want whatever that is
on your upper lip shaved off.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.685
And I'll tell you
why we're pushing the car,

01:00.933 --> 01:03.145
because
it's a fun football fundraiser.

01:03.372 --> 01:07.608
And we're gonna have fun, so we're gonna
put smiles on our faces right about now.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.614
Team comes out, town comes out,
money gets exchanged.

01:10.739 --> 01:12.363
It's a good thing. Understood?

01:12.613 --> 01:13.614
Got it, Coach!

01:13.782 --> 01:15.574
Let's be kind
and courteous out there.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.201
<i>Hello, neighborhood!</i>

01:17.480 --> 01:18.619
<i>We're the Lions!</i>

01:21.724 --> 01:23.133
<i>Let's hear it, guys!</i>

01:25.457 --> 01:28.355
Even at church, everyone is
really not being nice to me

01:28.480 --> 01:30.339
about this whole
Luke Cafferty thing.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.084
That's our congregation.

01:32.442 --> 01:34.892
All sweet and holy
inside the church,

01:35.409 --> 01:37.516
then as soon as
they get out the door,

01:37.924 --> 01:40.725
- bitchy and judgmental.
- Well, welcome to the world, honey.

01:41.009 --> 01:42.803
It's not gonna be my world.

01:43.189 --> 01:44.353
What isn't?

01:44.846 --> 01:47.156
Going to church
with a bunch of hypocrites.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.651
Hypocrites are everywhere.
It has nothing to do with church.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.487
That's no way to think about it.
There's always gonna be some bad apples,

01:54.107 --> 01:56.615
but church is about you and God...

01:57.221 --> 01:59.869
So if it's just about me and God,
why can't I just worship at home?

02:00.037 --> 02:02.913
I mean, I think that church
is also about community

02:03.475 --> 02:06.525
and family and you know,
there's just a lot to it.

02:07.803 --> 02:10.463
<i>We need your quarters,
your dollar bills,</i>

02:11.047 --> 02:13.716
<i>your good wishes
in monetary fashion!</i>

02:14.039 --> 02:15.134
<i>Let's hear it, boys!</i>

02:15.302 --> 02:17.595
Not feeling love out there.
You feeling love?

02:17.763 --> 02:18.963
Tink, shut up,

02:19.413 --> 02:22.718
stop sweating on me
and push this piece of junk, okay?

02:23.143 --> 02:26.854
<i>We got forty bucks, people!
Thank you, good people of the street!</i>

02:27.359 --> 02:29.482
Good to see ya!
Thank you very much!

02:29.650 --> 02:30.775
Thank you very much!

02:30.943 --> 02:32.526
<i>We are the East Dillon Lions!</i>

02:33.058 --> 02:34.814
<i>Feed us! Feed us!</i>

02:35.847 --> 02:37.239
- I'm out.
- What do you mean?

02:37.571 --> 02:39.241
- I'm out of money.
- What do you mean?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.766
- I'm out of money.
- Listen to me.

02:42.474 --> 02:44.330
It's all I got left.
That's about a 100 bucks.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.415
Don't give it all to one person.
Spread it out.

02:46.846 --> 02:50.211
- I'm trying, some are taking it.
- Give it to people who don't take it.

02:50.676 --> 02:53.798
<i>Look at these boys
pushing this car for ten miles!</i>

03:03.341 --> 03:04.941
There's your tricycle.

03:06.026 --> 03:07.812
- What?
- The tricycle!

03:10.133 --> 03:11.283
That's great.

03:11.527 --> 03:14.819
I need you to drive me to Clearwater
on Tuesday. I need to pick up some metal

03:14.987 --> 03:16.821
so I can finish this piece of crap.

03:16.989 --> 03:19.497
Why do you call
everything you work on crap?

03:19.622 --> 03:21.199
Because it is all crap.

03:21.790 --> 03:23.285
I call the Mona Lisa crap.

03:23.950 --> 03:25.371
In fact, the Mona Lisa is crap.

03:25.822 --> 03:28.122
There are better things I call crap.

03:30.618 --> 03:32.002
Clearwater is 200 miles away.

03:32.505 --> 03:33.671
- Just about.
- Right.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.294
And I got a shift I gotta do so...

03:36.500 --> 03:39.251
I mean, I can't take the whole day
and chauffeur you up there.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.263
You're here to learn about art
from an artist!

03:43.536 --> 03:47.142
You can't take a day off because
you got a shift to deliver pizza?!

03:56.549 --> 03:58.814
We already have uniforms.
Why do we need new ones?

03:58.939 --> 04:01.162
- Because I burned the uniforms.
- Taylor...

04:01.749 --> 04:04.118
I burned them. That's what you do.
They were damn 30 years old.

04:04.977 --> 04:07.658
This is not like I just burned them
for no reason.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.233
You end the old cycle,
you start the new, Levi.

04:10.358 --> 04:12.293
You know, you get rid of the past.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.407
Fact of the matter is
the team and I we went out

04:14.538 --> 04:16.911
and we made up a good amount
of money, it's just that...

04:17.036 --> 04:19.048
Now we're just a little shy
of what we need

04:19.216 --> 04:22.542
and all I'm asking is you
and the school is, you know...

04:22.667 --> 04:25.115
if you'd help us with the downpayment.
We can pay for the rest.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.558
I don't think you understand
the financial situation here.

04:27.979 --> 04:30.329
We ain't close to talking about
more money for football.

04:30.454 --> 04:32.771
Levi, it's expensive starting up
a new football program...

04:33.114 --> 04:35.816
Starting up a new football program
is a little premature.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.528
Let's see if we can finish up some games
before we start writing checks.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.347
What is that supposed to mean?

04:41.472 --> 04:44.116
If you can't finish games,
I can't keep this program going.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.701
Students are getting hurt.

04:45.987 --> 04:48.996
I don't want no jokes down
at the school board meetings. I'm tired.

04:49.611 --> 04:52.200
Either you turn it around
or we're gonna shut it down.

04:52.325 --> 04:55.044
What do you mean?
You're gonna shut down the program?

04:55.747 --> 04:57.630
You weren't even supposed
to take this job!

04:58.124 --> 04:59.381
Or to be here.

04:59.683 --> 05:02.433
So you're the only
that didn't get the joke.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.760
4x03: IN THE SKIN OF A LION

05:14.815 --> 05:18.317
Subtitles: Team Lions
With the participation of:

05:18.485 --> 05:21.862
Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh,
GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Nam, Tactactac

06:03.895 --> 06:06.073
Morning! I made you toast.

06:06.972 --> 06:07.992
Are you serious?

06:09.735 --> 06:10.869
It's worth it, eat it.

06:11.599 --> 06:12.621
What time is it?

06:13.122 --> 06:16.458
Morning. And since you're up, anyways,
can you give me a ride to school?

06:17.961 --> 06:20.921
Come on. Put some pants on.
Watch your head. Watch your head!

06:23.174 --> 06:24.221
Hurry up!

06:24.446 --> 06:26.093
I'll be waiting in the truck.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.904
Here you go, sweetheart.
There.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.964
Here's your sippy.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.184
- Hey, Honey.
- Good Morney, Grace.

06:34.571 --> 06:37.730
You know, yesterday in church,
all that stuff you were saying...

06:38.581 --> 06:40.679
Do you feel like
we're making you go to church or...

06:40.804 --> 06:43.205
It's not like you're making me
go to church, it's just...

06:43.330 --> 06:46.804
You know, something
that we all do as a family.

06:46.929 --> 06:48.365
It's like a tradition, but...

06:49.378 --> 06:52.578
If you stop going, then I don't think
I'd probably keep going.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.506
Coach Taylor at half-time,
"We"re done!"

06:57.868 --> 07:00.819
"We're beat up,
we can play anymore."

07:01.765 --> 07:03.215
I can't believe it.

07:04.028 --> 07:05.049
Hey, guys.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.596
You're waiting on me.
You're backing up. Let's go.

07:10.926 --> 07:13.057
We missed you
at the game Friday night, Buddy.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.267
Yeah,
I had to listen to it on the radio.

07:15.755 --> 07:17.589
I was really sick, it was terrible.

07:17.714 --> 07:20.355
Anything you feel like
sharing with us, Buddy?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.339
Anything about a certain mailbox

07:24.464 --> 07:26.779
or an old friend of yours
named Eric Taylor?

07:29.644 --> 07:30.994
I don't think so.

07:31.879 --> 07:33.801
I don't know what you're implying.

07:34.198 --> 07:37.498
I think this Luke deal has made
everybody go a little crazy.

07:37.733 --> 07:39.010
You know, Joe,

07:39.415 --> 07:42.125
I was a Panther
before everybody here.

07:42.647 --> 07:43.647
So,

07:44.297 --> 07:45.798
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

07:47.195 --> 07:48.945
Go ahead with the agenda.

07:51.735 --> 07:52.977
Alright then.

07:53.792 --> 07:55.099
Gentlemen,

07:55.267 --> 07:57.667
there is a 13-year old quarterback
in a Pop Warner League

07:57.792 --> 07:59.955
down in Little Tree
that needs a closer look at.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.480
Who's gonna go down there?

08:02.443 --> 08:04.566
Lions in the house.
Let me hear you say, "Oh yeah!"

08:04.734 --> 08:07.694
- What is that dude so happy about?
- I don't know what he is happy about.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.405
I guess he thinks he gonna come out here
and kick our asses.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.575
- Something, man.
- He's all, I'm a Panther.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.702
Let's go!

08:17.583 --> 08:18.583
Execute!

08:21.247 --> 08:23.397
You're a long way from home, boy.

08:26.314 --> 08:27.131
I guess so.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.135
Come on, get after him.
Pick him up.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.846
Come on, Vince.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.933
What are you doing?
You're dancing out here. Dancing.

08:38.388 --> 08:41.395
Don't start my day off like this.
Why is it I'm always talking to you?

08:41.806 --> 08:45.456
I spend half my day and my practice,
out here, talking to you.

08:45.864 --> 08:47.714
Get in the front. Do it again.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.428
Get in the front.
Let me see it.

08:50.763 --> 08:52.030
Luke, come here.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.409
- I want you at the defensive backs.
- I don't play D, coach.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.953
If I tell you to get down
to the defensive backs, you do.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.209
Get on the defensive backs.

09:00.334 --> 09:02.040
Tim, you wanna take him down?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.701
If you'd like to hurry that up,
that'd be just fine.

09:04.826 --> 09:06.376
It's a pleasure, man.

09:06.635 --> 09:09.381
Do it again. Let me see it again.
Get after him!

09:09.549 --> 09:12.200
Move him! Come on,
let me see some of the speed!

09:13.219 --> 09:14.421
How you doing?

09:14.546 --> 09:16.991
I mean, I'm alright,
that's just I don't play DB.

09:17.116 --> 09:18.266
It's alright.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.418
What are you doing here?
Coaching now?

09:20.543 --> 09:22.943
- I'm helping out when I can.
- Nice.

09:24.322 --> 09:25.822
I saw you win State.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.776
There you go.
DB it up.

09:30.339 --> 09:33.491
"His last installment
at the Austin Museum of Modern Art

09:33.616 --> 09:35.663
"is nothing short of mind bending.

09:35.788 --> 09:38.834
"A violent fusion of metal and artistry
that invokes somehow

09:38.959 --> 09:42.164
"both anger and beauty through a complex
interplay of architecture and light.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.815
"Brilliant, visceral,
and ultimately, ethereal,

09:45.940 --> 09:47.635
"this work is not to be missed."

09:47.760 --> 09:50.756
- You got the right Richard Sherman?
- Yep, it's him.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.216
"Brilliant and ethereal"?

09:52.384 --> 09:55.344
- It's what it says.
- The dude is an angry, abusive idiot.

09:55.742 --> 09:58.013
I don't understand
how he can get described as ethereal.

09:58.670 --> 09:59.848
I don't know.

10:00.339 --> 10:02.059
Maybe it's his evil twin.

10:02.847 --> 10:04.102
Yeah, maybe.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.770
Clearwater and back.

10:06.537 --> 10:08.987
This is going to be 400 miles
of hell.

10:11.695 --> 10:12.697
Hey, coach.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.406
Hey, Doug, how you doing?

10:14.948 --> 10:15.948
I'm good.

10:18.834 --> 10:19.934
Nicely done.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.871
- How is everything?
- Good, good.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.448
The uniforms look great,
they're coming along, look beautiful.

10:25.573 --> 10:26.959
You're gonna be real happy.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.206
Look, I know... I know I'm late
on payment and all this but...

10:30.331 --> 10:33.066
I know things are
rough here right now.

10:33.191 --> 10:35.008
It's just
if we're gonna deliver on Friday...

10:35.176 --> 10:38.178
Well, I understand. We've had a few
little hiccups with our fundraising.

10:38.630 --> 10:39.954
- Sure.
- And...

10:41.174 --> 10:45.178
Look, Coach, you've been a friend
of Under Armor for a long while and...

10:45.434 --> 10:48.664
that's why we're doing this at our cost
and I'm gonna throw in some...

10:49.014 --> 10:51.692
hats and polos for your staff,
'cause you helped me out

10:51.860 --> 10:54.269
when I was starting off.
So I won't forget that.

10:54.394 --> 10:56.844
I appreciate that,
I appreciate the...

10:57.898 --> 10:59.819
But I'm gonna need
a little something

10:59.944 --> 11:01.994
- to take back to Baltimore.
- Sure, I understand.

11:02.377 --> 11:05.581
How much?
How much is it that you need today?

11:06.311 --> 11:07.311
Five.

11:08.583 --> 11:09.783
Five thousand?

11:13.921 --> 11:14.921
Alright...

11:16.176 --> 11:17.226
You give me

11:18.132 --> 11:20.752
three now and two more on delivery

11:21.405 --> 11:23.231
and we'll let it go with that.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.803
Alright. That's good, thank you.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.792
Listen, I appreciate that very much.
I appreciate your understanding.

11:41.071 --> 11:43.402
- Is this a personal check, Coach?
- Yes, it is.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.340
This gonna be okay with you?

11:45.650 --> 11:47.247
If it's okay with you,
it is with me.

11:48.547 --> 11:51.526
- Alright. I'll get it going.
- Thank you very much.

11:52.334 --> 11:53.337
Alrighty.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.185
Julie the other day
was talking about

12:05.310 --> 12:07.184
how she doesn't want to go
to church anymore.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.936
Like she's questioning her faith
or something.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.688
You know what?
She's a teenager.

12:12.377 --> 12:15.077
You give her a week
and she'll turn around.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.165
Be a hundred and eighty degrees.

12:17.290 --> 12:19.428
But who knows
where she'll go from there.

12:19.553 --> 12:22.578
I don't think she's going to hell
anytime soon so don't worry about it.

12:22.703 --> 12:24.951
I gotta go meet with Buddy.
I'm gonna try to figure out

12:25.119 --> 12:26.982
how in the hell
you're supposed to...

12:27.107 --> 12:29.831
- beg money from the Boosters.
- I hate that.

12:30.363 --> 12:31.833
Alright. Hey, listen.

12:32.078 --> 12:33.752
Did you write a check...

12:34.740 --> 12:37.714
and not put it in the book?
Because there's a check missing.

12:38.129 --> 12:39.925
Yeah, it's for Reds.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.116
It's for the Dry Cleaners.
It's for $45.

12:44.226 --> 12:47.244
- Sorry.
- You've got to put that in the book.

12:47.369 --> 12:48.600
I can't keep track.

12:57.214 --> 12:58.688
- I'm here.
- Come on, let's go.

12:58.813 --> 13:01.405
- We got 200 miles to cover.
- We're taking my car?

13:01.573 --> 13:05.166
- I hope you're paying for gas.
- I'm teaching you the meaning of life

13:05.467 --> 13:08.713
- and I'm supposed to cover for gas too?
- Meaning of life...

13:09.500 --> 13:12.270
Maybe I should get you a lunch
and how about a damn souvenir?

13:12.395 --> 13:15.201
I'm just saying
this is a non-paying internship, okay?

13:15.326 --> 13:18.789
- Smells like old pizza in here, man.
- Well, that's how I pay for gas.

13:19.928 --> 13:22.440
I'm glad you're masking it
with cigarette smoke.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.094
- That's cool.
- Let's roll.

13:27.145 --> 13:28.831
- Yes, sir?
- Come here.

13:29.632 --> 13:30.642
Yeah, coach?

13:32.339 --> 13:34.688
I want you on special teams today
working on punting.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.899
- Yeah. I'd love to catch some punts.
- Good.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.986
I don't want you catching.
I want you to work on the punting.

13:41.803 --> 13:44.103
You want me, like, kicking the ball?

13:44.228 --> 13:45.654
I don't know if I've ever...

13:45.779 --> 13:47.733
That's what you do
when you punt the ball.

13:47.858 --> 13:50.871
- I understand. I know what it is.
- Special teams punting.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.776
- Can you do that for me?
- Yes. I'm only considering myself...

13:55.372 --> 13:56.376
a hands man.

13:56.829 --> 13:59.004
I need a punter.
So if you would consider

13:59.172 --> 14:01.631
hang times and couffin corners,
I'd appreciate that.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.916
- Thank you very much.
- I'll go start practicing right now.

14:05.041 --> 14:06.391
Thank you, coach.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.143
- Coach, can I have a word please?
- Sure. Come on in.

14:14.158 --> 14:17.481
I think we got off on the wrong foot
and I wanted to clear everything out.

14:18.112 --> 14:19.401
I just wanna say...

14:19.665 --> 14:23.665
I don't hold anything against you
for the thing between me and your wife.

14:23.865 --> 14:24.865
And...

14:25.171 --> 14:27.365
I'm not here to give you a hard time
but to play football.

14:29.178 --> 14:30.535
Good, I'm glad.

14:31.212 --> 14:32.954
'Coz I don't think you should be.

14:33.355 --> 14:36.846
As far as my wife's concerned, she was
not the one who caused these problems.

14:36.971 --> 14:39.534
You caused these problems
for yourself, isn't it?

14:39.909 --> 14:43.256
You were doing something knowingly wrong
and you got caught, yeah?

14:43.974 --> 14:47.978
That lands yourself responsible
so take that responsibility.

14:49.142 --> 14:52.432
As far as the rest, we'll see
what you got when you're out there.

14:56.115 --> 14:57.315
Thanks, coach.

15:02.813 --> 15:05.509
You see stuff like this, okay?
Get that, too.

15:05.634 --> 15:06.634
All right.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.895
When you're looking at all this rusty,
metal stuff, it's all dirty...

15:13.098 --> 15:14.948
do you see something in it?

15:16.232 --> 15:17.916
Do I see something in it?

15:18.573 --> 15:21.545
I mean, like something,
for your art.

15:33.580 --> 15:34.933
I see the face of God.

15:36.043 --> 15:38.693
- Right.
- I don't know, man! I don't know.

15:38.902 --> 15:40.480
You ask too many damn questions.

15:41.028 --> 15:42.028
Questions.

15:42.286 --> 15:44.818
- It was one question.
- Gonna take a little break.

15:45.238 --> 15:46.438
Not you, but...

15:47.602 --> 15:49.072
let's get the rest in there.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.240
Yeah.

15:58.284 --> 16:00.500
I had to borrow your bathroom,
'coz mine's not working.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.919
I talked to your mom about it.
She said it's cool, so...

16:03.453 --> 16:05.885
Okay, I don't care.
Hey, which one do you like better?

16:06.554 --> 16:07.654
The red one?

16:09.217 --> 16:10.218
Or the pink one?

16:10.634 --> 16:12.971
- For what?
- I have a pageant coming up

16:13.139 --> 16:16.398
and these are kinda old
but I don't think they're too short.

16:16.523 --> 16:17.559
What do you think?

16:17.727 --> 16:21.199
I don't think I'm qualified. I think
it's best to ask your mom for this.

16:21.324 --> 16:24.608
She's not here, and it's just a dress.
Which one do you prefer?

16:24.822 --> 16:26.902
- Where's your mom?
- She's working.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.529
Every night?
She can't help out with this ever?

16:30.148 --> 16:31.742
Yeah. It's not a big deal.

16:32.482 --> 16:34.909
- I can try it on if that's easier?
- What?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.455
- I can try them on for you.
- I don't know.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.659
- I don't think I...
- Wait, which one?

16:39.784 --> 16:41.416
You're good. Pink for sure!

16:41.740 --> 16:44.085
Get the pink.
You'll win with that.

16:44.848 --> 16:45.962
Good luck.

16:53.581 --> 16:56.585
Alright, so how about I just throw
my last two pucks and we take off?

16:56.710 --> 16:57.515
Why?

16:57.913 --> 17:00.101
I got stuff to do.
I got people to take care of.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.686
We're doing anything here.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.190
- We're just playing shuffleboard.
- Alright, let's talk then.

17:05.885 --> 17:07.776
- You want to talk now?
- I can talk.

17:08.567 --> 17:10.194
I'm not a dick all the time.

17:10.586 --> 17:13.239
- So talk. Talk.
- Okay.

17:13.406 --> 17:16.214
Fine.
What would you say is the most

17:16.804 --> 17:19.329
important tool
for an artist to have?

17:19.926 --> 17:23.249
- What's with you and these questions?
- You just told me to talk.

17:23.746 --> 17:26.169
I meant, you know,
talk about yourself while

17:26.771 --> 17:29.089
I'm secretly mocking you in my head.

17:29.602 --> 17:33.510
You know what? How about I settle up
our tab and then we'll take off.

17:35.356 --> 17:36.356
Watch out.

17:36.869 --> 17:39.705
The most important tool
an artist can have

17:39.830 --> 17:41.317
is selfishness.

17:42.703 --> 17:43.978
- Selfishness?
- Yeah.

17:44.242 --> 17:46.227
It means
you're gonna spend your life

17:46.661 --> 17:48.561
trying to express some quiet

17:49.000 --> 17:52.153
dark corner, deep, deep inside you.

17:52.687 --> 17:54.739
You will put aside love,

17:55.433 --> 17:56.282
God,

17:57.008 --> 17:58.008
life...

17:58.678 --> 18:00.890
in order to follow this craving.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.540
So my advice to you is

18:03.708 --> 18:06.626
to just screw everybody else
and maybe you got a chance.

18:10.658 --> 18:11.965
I wrote a personal check.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.267
I've got to get that money together
and quick.

18:14.392 --> 18:16.949
I don't know how to talk to boosters.
You do.

18:17.074 --> 18:19.931
I don't know how to ask for money.
You're great at asking for money.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.148
All I'm doing is asking your help.

18:22.460 --> 18:24.369
I know and I'd like to Eric

18:24.494 --> 18:28.231
but I got Joe McCoy and thoses guys
breathing down my neck.

18:28.796 --> 18:31.526
They think I'm the one
who told you about the mailbox.

18:32.547 --> 18:35.321
- You are the one who told me.
- I know,

18:35.689 --> 18:38.139
but I've got to unknow that
right now.

18:38.597 --> 18:40.410
They may be having me followed.

18:41.128 --> 18:44.414
They probably got my phone tapped
or maybe bugged. You know the guys,

18:44.582 --> 18:47.709
- they're crazy, man!
- A little crazy, but let me tell you.

18:48.117 --> 18:50.067
Levi, now, Principal Burnwell

18:50.299 --> 18:53.931
has informed me he's willing
to shut down the football at the school,

18:54.142 --> 18:55.269
if need be.

18:55.896 --> 18:58.617
That's what I'm up against.
I'm asking you for your help.

18:58.742 --> 18:59.804
That's terrible.

19:00.204 --> 19:01.994
And I'm sorry to say this

19:02.258 --> 19:04.890
but I cannot help you right now.

19:05.284 --> 19:06.434
I just can't.

19:07.923 --> 19:09.397
- You know what?
- What?

19:10.464 --> 19:14.095
You need to polish that ring of yours.
It's looking a bit tarnished.

19:24.921 --> 19:27.082
An earthquake in West Texas?

19:27.933 --> 19:28.933
Yeah.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.766
They have 'em. Odessa?

19:31.052 --> 19:34.366
Odessa's on the permian basin
and that's a fault line, honey.

19:34.491 --> 19:36.674
They have 'em.
What would you do? Would you pray?

19:38.541 --> 19:40.720
I'd probably check on you
and Gracie and Dad

19:41.644 --> 19:43.598
and then I'd stand under a doorway.

19:44.236 --> 19:47.977
Alright, I hear you. That's great.
It's all good but would you pray?

19:48.352 --> 19:49.354
How about...

19:49.604 --> 19:50.626
next time...

19:50.940 --> 19:53.483
there's an earthquake in West Texas
I'll let you know?

19:56.543 --> 19:57.737
Come on, now!

20:05.454 --> 20:08.122
Way to bring the wood, Cafferty!
Bring that wood!

20:15.172 --> 20:16.172
All right!

20:28.477 --> 20:31.062
Come on!
Hey, Vince, what are you doing, man?

20:31.415 --> 20:34.733
You've got to make that play.
You've gotta catch that ball.

20:35.088 --> 20:36.484
How can you miss that?

20:37.254 --> 20:40.655
You're not gonna make that play today,
how are you gonna make it Friday?

20:40.946 --> 20:41.948
Look at me.

20:42.362 --> 20:45.251
You can't make that play,
what are you out here for?

20:46.009 --> 20:47.829
Hey guys, let's bring it in!

20:52.402 --> 20:53.251
Good job.

20:53.596 --> 20:55.920
What am I, the Invisible Man out here?
Did you see that?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.965
It's like he's not even seeing me
work my butt off out there.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.718
- What do you mean?
- Coach didn't even look at me.

21:02.051 --> 21:05.388
He's got a lot on his plate, that's why.
Keep doing what you're doing though.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.056
Thank you for noticing.

21:10.172 --> 21:11.572
I'll see ya later.

21:13.758 --> 21:14.808
Who's that?

21:16.934 --> 21:18.818
I'm renting a room from her mom,
that's it.

21:19.035 --> 21:21.520
- You're what?
- I'm renting a room from her mom.

21:21.645 --> 21:23.943
Wish I was renting a room
from her mom.

21:26.065 --> 21:27.165
Just joking.

21:30.657 --> 21:33.758
Look man. You make sure he know
the difference between coach and dad.

21:33.883 --> 21:37.128
He's always yelling at me, you know,
on the field. Telling me what to do.

21:37.253 --> 21:39.255
Pushing me. Grabbing my jersey.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.675
He embarrass me in front of everyone.
That's not how I get down, dude.

21:43.014 --> 21:45.064
That white boy sucks.
Why's he all up in my face?

21:45.189 --> 21:48.556
Coming up where I hang out,
at my house, talking to my moms.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.976
And you already know my mom's situation.
You know how I feel about that.

21:52.413 --> 21:54.020
It's alright though, it's cool

21:54.188 --> 21:56.920
'coz he's bringing that white boy Luke.
He think he gonna take over.

21:57.045 --> 21:58.942
He's supposed to be
a Panther's star.

22:00.111 --> 22:03.112
That's my spot. That's my team.
I'm the Running Back.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.073
Look man! At the end of the day,

22:05.307 --> 22:08.368
white man gonna stick with the white.
They're gonna look out for each other.

22:08.601 --> 22:10.211
That's what we gotta do.

22:10.336 --> 22:12.247
We gotta look out for us, alright?

22:14.942 --> 22:15.942
25 more.

22:17.332 --> 22:19.921
Hey, Riggins, why don't you wear
your Panthers state ring?

22:20.830 --> 22:23.383
I don't know. That's a good question.
I guess I don't like rings.

22:24.216 --> 22:26.594
What was it like, going to State
and winning that ring?

22:27.504 --> 22:28.971
It's pretty good, man.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.140
You gotta give this team a chance.

22:32.813 --> 22:36.187
Dude, be serious.
This team is not the Dillon Panthers.

22:36.995 --> 22:38.371
The Coach doesn't like me.

22:38.496 --> 22:40.487
He's been pretty clear on the field.

22:40.612 --> 22:44.040
In practice, sticking me on D,
no disrespect, that's not what I do.

22:44.165 --> 22:47.073
He's mad about his wife
getting all backlash

22:47.241 --> 22:49.993
for throwing me off the Panthers.
I want to play football, man.

22:50.677 --> 22:51.869
I want a State ring.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.129
Like I said,

22:53.254 --> 22:55.873
give it a chance, trust the coach.

22:59.774 --> 23:00.920
- What?
- How're you?

23:01.088 --> 23:02.741
- Good, what's up?
- Where you going?

23:02.866 --> 23:06.342
Drum up some business from local leaders
in the form of cash. What do you need?

23:07.679 --> 23:11.264
As you know I've been working
with Luke, a lot. And he's good.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.954
Damn good. And I think he's worth
getting a tougher look at.

23:15.689 --> 23:18.938
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He thinks you hate him

23:19.106 --> 23:20.445
is what I'm trying to say.

23:20.570 --> 23:23.151
I don't have the time or resources
for sensitivity training.

23:23.668 --> 23:27.030
He's got to get rid of the concept
that we're gonna kiss his ass 24/7

23:27.511 --> 23:30.867
'coz he's gracing us with his presence.
Tell him to shut up and work him hard.

23:31.035 --> 23:34.185
- I'll deal with the rest later. Thanks.
- Yes, sir.

23:41.043 --> 23:42.143
Can we play?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.393
I mean, I was supposed to be...

23:44.924 --> 23:48.346
working on my punting
but if you all want to play afterwards

23:48.544 --> 23:51.429
- or if you want to watch...
- Yeah! Let's do it!

23:55.887 --> 23:56.893
You suck!

23:57.224 --> 23:58.227
That's nice.

23:59.470 --> 24:02.523
- I'm sorry.
- The ball's supposed to go straight.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.525
See that was actually all planned...

24:04.818 --> 24:06.173
Want some pointers?

24:07.209 --> 24:08.863
Do you know a lot about punting?

24:09.551 --> 24:11.051
Yeah, actually I do.

24:11.176 --> 24:12.483
Here look, you wanna...

24:12.608 --> 24:15.036
Okay, I can show you 3 steps, alright?
You wanna make sure

24:15.538 --> 24:18.247
that you keep that lean forward position
so keep your head down.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.167
Make sure
that you hit the middle of the ball

24:21.335 --> 24:24.379
with this part of your foot, okay?
So point your toes, okay?

24:24.706 --> 24:27.507
And make sure you follow through
all the way with your leg.

24:27.853 --> 24:30.968
But don't be stiff.
Like, loosen up, okay?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.929
- But don't think!
- Okay.

24:37.139 --> 24:39.310
- Well, that was better.
- That was good.

24:39.549 --> 24:42.230
I'm good, right?
Yeah, I'm good.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.315
I don't think
that's ever gonna happen again.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.485
Yeah, it will...

24:45.610 --> 24:48.611
Especially not whenever all the
thousands of screaming fans are around.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.198
- What fans?
- I mean, one away game or something...

24:54.344 --> 24:57.787
- Can you all go get the balls?
- Let's go!

24:59.615 --> 25:00.830
My little men...

25:00.955 --> 25:02.542
You just gotta keep doing it, okay?

25:02.710 --> 25:03.902
Over and over.

25:04.027 --> 25:06.796
Do it thousands of times
'coz you'll get that muscle memory.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.869
Just forget about the...

25:08.994 --> 25:11.926
you know, the guys,
the big guys charging at you,

25:12.094 --> 25:14.432
the fans, the chaos...
Just like zone in,

25:14.557 --> 25:16.264
zone in inside yourself

25:16.900 --> 25:20.101
and forget it all.
Let all chaos just go...

25:22.721 --> 25:23.987
Just let it go...

25:24.173 --> 25:25.356
Let it go, you know?

25:27.083 --> 25:29.193
Where'd you learn so much
about football?

25:30.380 --> 25:31.863
My... my father.

25:32.168 --> 25:34.615
He used to play football,
he was a quarterback.

25:35.078 --> 25:36.756
He almost went pro, too,

25:36.881 --> 25:39.787
but now he can't stand it.
Thinks it's a big waste of time.

25:40.034 --> 25:41.872
Where'd you learn so much
about the...

25:43.334 --> 25:44.542
Did you study Buddhism?

25:44.710 --> 25:47.587
No, no, no, I just...
It's my life,

25:47.755 --> 25:48.755
you know?

25:54.851 --> 25:58.855
How'd it go trying to get the Boosters
together and all that what not?

26:00.851 --> 26:05.056
I went to about
twelve of the local businesses

26:05.635 --> 26:06.731
and found out

26:06.899 --> 26:09.164
that they either don't know
there's a football team,

26:09.289 --> 26:11.819
or they could give a damn less.

26:12.497 --> 26:13.821
Sorry about that.

26:14.134 --> 26:16.449
Yeah...
And I stopped over at the bar

26:17.353 --> 26:20.411
and I had a drink and I left the car
over there and Alan gave me a ride home.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.977
So if you could take me
to get it, I'd appreciate it.

26:23.102 --> 26:23.915
Okay.

26:25.387 --> 26:28.836
You know yesterday, you asked me
about the check for the Dry Cleaners?

26:29.410 --> 26:32.381
It wasn't for the Dry Cleaners.
It wasn't for $45 dollars.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.800
It was for Under Armor.
It was for gear for the team

26:35.059 --> 26:36.709
and it was for $3,000.

26:36.834 --> 26:38.346
You wrote a check for $3,000?

26:38.514 --> 26:41.098
- We don't have $3,000 in our account!
- I know that.

26:41.947 --> 26:43.634
But when I wrote the check...

26:44.092 --> 26:47.480
It's not gonna be run through right away
so you don't have to worry about it.

26:47.816 --> 26:49.860
I would have appreciated
if you had talked to me.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.359
I didn't have time to.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.664
- You didn't have time to talk about it?
- No, I didn't.

26:53.789 --> 26:55.363
I'm telling you about it now.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.616
Listen, I know you're having
a hard time, but come on now.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.859
Why would you not
talk to me about that?

27:00.984 --> 27:03.461
They said if I don't write the check,
I don't have uniforms.

27:03.586 --> 27:06.415
Without team, I don't make money anyway,
so what the hell does it matter?

27:06.783 --> 27:09.085
If I can get the money from Burnwell
who I've been talking to,

27:09.253 --> 27:11.285
which I think I can do,
everything will be fine.

27:11.410 --> 27:13.339
It's just a matter of doing it.
I just need time.

27:13.507 --> 27:16.300
- I'm just telling you for the sake...
- Don't raise your voice.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.969
I'm not raising my voice.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.846
Why don't you just stay calm
and stop getting all riled up?

27:21.014 --> 27:24.016
You'll get your damn uniforms, but in
the meantime, what about our accounts?

27:24.184 --> 27:26.894
You write yourself
a check for $3,000

27:27.062 --> 27:30.606
without talking to me about it, you lie
to me about it, we don't have that money

27:31.465 --> 27:33.526
and then you come in here
and yell at me?

27:34.504 --> 27:35.854
I don't think so.

28:30.386 --> 28:33.085
Hey, Luke!
Your football coach is here.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.005
He's got work to do before school.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.779
- I won't take much time at all.
- I appreciate it.

28:39.404 --> 28:40.747
Morning, Coach.

28:40.872 --> 28:42.470
- I'm alright. And you?
- Good.

28:43.308 --> 28:44.847
- Why are you here?
- I understand

28:45.015 --> 28:46.849
you're not happy at practice.
Wanna talk?

28:48.442 --> 28:51.004
No disrespect, Coach,
I just feel like I'm not being used.

28:51.129 --> 28:52.897
You're not giving me
a chance out there.

28:53.355 --> 28:54.607
What do you want from me?

28:55.152 --> 28:58.195
First of all, I haven't gotten a chance
to play offense, which is what I do.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.113
You'll get your chance.
You'll get it when I give it to you.

29:01.441 --> 29:02.923
I'm trying to put a team together.

29:03.048 --> 29:05.318
I got 18 other players
I'm trying to pay attention to.

29:05.443 --> 29:08.120
I can't put you up on a pedestal
and pay all the attention to you.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.582
I want to get out of here, alright?
That's why I'm playing football.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.293
I mean, this is it for me.
This is all I care about.

29:14.549 --> 29:17.713
All I ever cared about. My parents don't
help me out with this, they don't care.

29:18.406 --> 29:21.709
I was on my fast track, got to Dillon
Panthers and I'm not there anymore.

29:21.834 --> 29:24.720
But here I am, willing to kill myself
'coz I want to get out of here.

29:25.463 --> 29:27.431
I just want a chance to play ball.

29:28.088 --> 29:29.558
I want a chance to get noticed.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.052
I understand...

29:31.177 --> 29:34.397
that you're helluva player. You can run
circles around all the people out there.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.524
I understand everything
you've been through.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.523
I understand what it's like
to wanna be a Panther.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.654
Believe me, that's not lost on me.

29:43.636 --> 29:44.949
Anything else that you need?

29:45.117 --> 29:48.577
What I need? I need a scholarship to
a good school so I can get out of here.

29:48.833 --> 29:50.533
Listen, I'll tell you what.

29:51.413 --> 29:53.457
I will do everything in my power

29:53.929 --> 29:55.394
to get you just that,

29:56.690 --> 29:58.462
if you do one thing for me.

29:58.781 --> 29:59.588
What?

29:59.889 --> 30:01.317
I need you to lead.

30:02.601 --> 30:03.601
Alright.

30:04.382 --> 30:06.130
Do you understand what I'm saying?

30:06.255 --> 30:07.793
- Yeah.
- Lead...

30:08.777 --> 30:10.227
Alright, thank you.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.691
- Want a slap on the back? You earn it.
- Alright.

30:15.678 --> 30:18.682
- See you out there this afternoon.
- Alright, see you out there.

30:23.374 --> 30:24.447
Thanks for the ride.

30:24.691 --> 30:26.279
Yeah. You got a boyfriend?

30:26.706 --> 30:27.707
No, why?

30:27.832 --> 30:31.469
That's the guy that should be doing
all this, giving you rides everywhere.

30:31.793 --> 30:34.832
Since you're already doing it,
you'd be more efficient if you were.

30:37.853 --> 30:38.946
I'm just kidding.

30:40.218 --> 30:42.923
Have you ever run
into that new Cafferty kid?

30:43.170 --> 30:44.592
- Luke?
- Yeah, Luke.

30:44.835 --> 30:45.985
He likes you.

30:46.530 --> 30:49.180
I've been working with him
on the field and everything and...

30:49.431 --> 30:51.474
he doesn't stop
talking about you, so...

30:51.642 --> 30:52.452
And?

30:52.577 --> 30:56.498
I'm just giving you a heads up,
just in case you want a boyfriend.

30:57.099 --> 30:58.712
He's a pretty good guy.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.518
I'll talk to him.

31:04.609 --> 31:05.609
Good.

31:18.305 --> 31:21.128
I just thought I'd swing by
on my way home from work.

31:23.377 --> 31:24.381
I'm sorry.

31:24.969 --> 31:26.369
I appreciate that.

31:27.908 --> 31:29.822
Doug called from Under Armor.

31:29.947 --> 31:32.309
He said he's willing to wait
for the school to pay for the 2,000

31:32.434 --> 31:35.234
and the other 3,000,
he's gonna take it easy on me.

31:35.906 --> 31:37.353
And I will get it paid.

31:37.897 --> 31:38.897
OK.

31:40.626 --> 31:42.726
Honey, don't ever do that again.

31:43.171 --> 31:44.171
I won't.

31:45.325 --> 31:47.863
And I'm sorry
you're having such a hard time.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.332
Sounds like Coach is gonna be
moving up Sobel

31:58.500 --> 32:00.960
- to take Luke's spot, tonight.
- Yeah, meanwhile, Luke Cafferty

32:01.128 --> 32:03.629
is on his way of being massacred
in his first Lions game.

32:04.443 --> 32:05.593
What a waste.

32:06.071 --> 32:08.092
One good thing is gonna
come out of this, tough.

32:08.602 --> 32:10.636
McCoy is gunning
for Principal Taylor.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.846
What are you talking about, Lester?

32:13.014 --> 32:15.068
McCoy'll figure a way
to get that bitch out of there.

32:15.193 --> 32:18.243
- There you go.
- I can't even believe you, Moore.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.865
I got something to say to everybody.

32:23.620 --> 32:24.631
I hate to...

32:25.042 --> 32:26.402
spoil the party, but...

32:26.818 --> 32:29.071
This is to everybody.
You know what?

32:29.456 --> 32:31.115
I'm not a Panther anymore.

32:31.465 --> 32:34.278
You used to be my friends,
I don't know who you are.

32:34.661 --> 32:37.121
I don't know what you believe in,
but it's not the Panthers.

32:37.906 --> 32:41.125
It's not the Panthers I believed in,
it's not the Panthers we grew up with.

32:41.487 --> 32:43.794
I'll tell you that right now,
you wanna know another thing?

32:43.962 --> 32:46.630
I'm the one who told Eric
about the mailbox.

32:49.181 --> 32:52.928
I can't live with myself anymore,
I put that mailbox in, 12 years ago.

32:53.282 --> 32:55.472
In the middle of the night,
I dug that hole and put it in.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.183
It's my mailbox, I can do
whatever I want to with it.

32:59.099 --> 33:00.099
And Joe...

33:00.384 --> 33:01.186
I tried,

33:01.600 --> 33:03.981
but ever since you got here,
you've been a cancer to me,

33:04.479 --> 33:08.068
you've been a cancer to my friends
and you've been a cancer to this team.

33:08.981 --> 33:11.250
And just one more thing I wanna say.

33:11.707 --> 33:13.157
It's clear eyes,

33:13.571 --> 33:14.575
full hearts,

33:15.525 --> 33:16.575
can't lose.

33:28.590 --> 33:32.244
- I just gotta drop this off real quick.
- Yeah, no problem, take your time.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.286
Who the hell are you, little girl?

34:00.256 --> 34:01.978
Hi, I'm Julie.

34:03.426 --> 34:05.070
Matt's girlfriend.
He went inside

34:05.195 --> 34:07.189
to drop off that tool
you asked him to pick up.

34:07.587 --> 34:10.130
So you're the ball and chain
that keep dragging him down.

34:12.786 --> 34:15.686
I think I married you
about 20 years ago, babe.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.426
Thought we'll get new uniforms. What are
we doing, playing in our practice stuff?

34:35.551 --> 34:39.118
Tinker, why don't you do less talking
and more thinking about the game, son?

34:41.860 --> 34:42.860
Let's go.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.013
Let's go, gentlemen.
Let's go!

35:01.558 --> 35:03.308
Look at this!
Alright!

35:07.872 --> 35:09.800
Oh, these are official right here.

35:25.984 --> 35:27.406
Hey, listen up!

35:28.171 --> 35:29.460
Listen up, gentlemen.

35:29.715 --> 35:30.715
Listen up!

35:31.711 --> 35:33.228
They may be new...

35:33.787 --> 35:35.174
but they're still work clothes.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.094
Let's go to work!

35:53.933 --> 35:55.764
All of a sudden,
he was talking to me.

35:55.889 --> 35:58.387
That's the first time
I have a real conversation with him.

35:58.512 --> 36:00.824
He's actually a really smart guy.

36:01.257 --> 36:05.208
He had real interesting things to say,
it was crazy.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.415
Do you think I'm holding you back?

36:11.157 --> 36:11.963
No.

36:12.315 --> 36:13.128
Why?

36:13.521 --> 36:15.214
I was outside waiting for you...

36:15.967 --> 36:18.717
and Richard Sherman came out
and started talking to me.

36:19.425 --> 36:20.427
About what?

36:21.604 --> 36:24.598
He said I was the ball and chain
holding you back.

36:27.464 --> 36:28.625
That's stupid.

36:29.596 --> 36:31.855
You're the most
important thing in my life.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.818
What if that's the point?

36:35.774 --> 36:37.373
No, that's not the point.

36:38.002 --> 36:41.031
The point is that he's stupid,
that he was drunk.

36:41.706 --> 36:43.356
He don't know about us.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.786
Eat your bean curd.

36:46.308 --> 36:47.880
- Alright.
- Alright.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.167
<i>Lions down, 27-0 late in the fourth.</i>

36:52.855 --> 36:55.534
<i>They are definitely
gonna finish this one, folks.</i>

36:55.964 --> 36:58.799
<i>Cafferty on the Bronco blitz.
He hits him in the backfield!</i>

36:59.088 --> 37:01.468
<i>Luke Cafferty has been
bringing it all night!</i>

37:01.714 --> 37:02.719
Nice hit, Luke!

37:02.972 --> 37:05.323
<i>If the Lions could just
get on the board, tonight,</i>

37:05.448 --> 37:08.433
<i>it'd make a whole heck of a lot
of difference to this football team.</i>

37:08.601 --> 37:10.394
- That's it!
- <i>It drops back in the pocket.</i>

37:11.723 --> 37:14.401
<i>And Howard gets burned
on the wheel route.</i>

37:14.811 --> 37:16.151
<i>He's got a man open.</i>

37:16.443 --> 37:17.998
<i>He's got the outside!</i>

37:18.123 --> 37:21.006
<i>Luke Cafferty makes
another touchdown saving hit.</i>

37:21.131 --> 37:23.819
<i>Vince Howard has just gotten smoked
all night long.</i>

37:23.944 --> 37:26.824
<i>A real disappointment
after such a promising start.</i>

37:26.949 --> 37:27.953
Stay in it!

37:28.551 --> 37:30.654
Huddle up, defense.
Huddle up, defense!

37:30.779 --> 37:32.958
Vince, don't jump on the front,
it's 3 & 10.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.022
Who made you coach?
That's what I thought.

37:36.377 --> 37:37.573
4-3-code 2.

37:37.698 --> 37:39.799
- 4-3-code 2. Ready?
- Break.

37:40.773 --> 37:43.875
<i>Never say die, never quit.
30 seconds left in the game.</i>

37:44.000 --> 37:46.096
<i>Let's see if Cafferty and Howard
can put some pressure</i>

37:46.264 --> 37:48.891
<i>on this Rattler offense
and make something happen.</i>

37:50.694 --> 37:52.129
<i>And back to pass.</i>

37:53.063 --> 37:55.363
<i>Looking to cross the middle.
Fires!</i>

37:57.025 --> 38:00.319
<i>Luke Cafferty! Interception!
He's bringing it the other way!</i>

38:01.538 --> 38:02.946
- There you go!
- <i>Here we go!</i>

38:03.114 --> 38:05.115
<i>He's got a line up the sideline,
look at it go!</i>

38:05.283 --> 38:06.783
<i>Man, is this kid fast!</i>

38:06.951 --> 38:08.952
<i>One man to beat,
he's got a blocker on front!</i>

38:09.199 --> 38:10.204
<i>He could go!</i>

38:10.473 --> 38:12.372
- Stop him, Vince!
- <i>Oh, mercy!</i>

38:13.958 --> 38:15.042
What was that?

38:15.424 --> 38:17.711
<i>Luke Cafferty is up
and I'll tell you what,</i>

38:17.879 --> 38:21.251
<i>he's not happy about it,
Vince Howard is getting an earful.</i>

38:21.376 --> 38:24.509
- You are your own problem, Vince!
- Too fast, man. You're too fast.

38:24.805 --> 38:26.178
Vince, what was that?

38:26.346 --> 38:28.252
- What was that?
- I didn't have an angle!

38:28.377 --> 38:31.113
What do you mean, didn't have an angle?
You could've run circles around him!

38:31.238 --> 38:34.102
- Don't waste no energy, Coach!
- Let me tell you something!

38:34.227 --> 38:36.731
You know why I always pick on you?
'Coz you're good, that's why.

38:36.899 --> 38:40.087
You know why you have a problem?
'Coz you're your own worst damn enemy!

38:40.212 --> 38:42.500
- Fine! Get out of my face!
- No! You get out of my face

38:42.625 --> 38:44.935
and let me tell you something:
put that damn helmet right now.

38:45.060 --> 38:48.450
Don't you dare talk to me like that.
You change it right now.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.994
Or you will be out of this game
so damn fast you will never...

38:51.875 --> 38:53.121
- Yes, sir!
- Understood?

38:53.570 --> 38:55.457
- Landry!
- Yes, Coach.

38:55.973 --> 38:59.711
- Get out there. Get us a field goal.
- Field goal! Here we go! Here we go!

38:59.950 --> 39:01.672
You're on the field goal team!

39:01.840 --> 39:02.966
Get in there, then!

39:03.091 --> 39:06.343
Don't you ever take that helmet off
in front of me. Do you understand me?

39:06.942 --> 39:09.888
<i>Taylor lining up for the field goal.
Trying to get on the board.</i>

39:10.220 --> 39:11.598
<i>Clock is ticking, folks.</i>

39:11.766 --> 39:13.141
Snap the ball!

39:13.517 --> 39:16.934
- Snap the ball!
- <i>There's the snap. It's over his head.</i>

39:17.313 --> 39:19.558
<i>Bouncing around the carpet.
That was not pretty.</i>

39:19.683 --> 39:21.835
<i>Clark picks it up.
I don't know what he's going to do.</i>

39:21.960 --> 39:23.527
<i>Oh, he shovels it forward.</i>

39:23.695 --> 39:25.445
<i>Vince Howard on the outside.</i>

39:26.118 --> 39:27.823
Oh, what a move!
Just on the edge!

39:28.564 --> 39:30.450
Howard could go.
This could be it folks!

39:30.618 --> 39:32.582
Oh my, touchdown!

39:32.856 --> 39:34.037
Touchdown, East Dillon!

39:36.171 --> 39:37.611
<i>Vince Howard has scored.</i>

39:37.736 --> 39:41.169
<i>Coach Taylor and the East Dillon Lions
are on the board.</i>

39:41.337 --> 39:42.937
<i>Touchdown, hallelujah!</i>

39:44.920 --> 39:45.924
Alright, Lions!

39:58.479 --> 39:59.688
How was your date?

40:01.253 --> 40:03.249
- It was good.
- It was?

40:03.549 --> 40:04.649
It was good.

40:06.109 --> 40:07.362
I've been thinking.

40:08.282 --> 40:10.282
I think I want you to come
to church with me,

40:10.783 --> 40:12.951
'cause it makes me feel like family.

40:13.643 --> 40:17.437
And I like having you sit next to me,
at least for a little bit longer.

40:18.290 --> 40:21.376
And I think it's good
that you're questioning your faith.

40:22.449 --> 40:24.989
I just want you to have faith
in something.

40:26.686 --> 40:28.216
Something that can hold you...

40:29.091 --> 40:31.497
when I'm not going to be able
to hold you anymore.

40:36.404 --> 40:38.276
I'll be there Sunday.

40:40.436 --> 40:43.786
I'm sorry, but you're always
going to be my little girl.

40:50.266 --> 40:51.266
Richard!

41:25.245 --> 41:27.596
- Get up!
- Ah, screw you.

41:29.277 --> 41:30.849
Alright, screw you, too.

41:33.646 --> 41:34.991
What are you doing?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.824
I'm just looking at this thing.

41:38.136 --> 41:39.496
That's a piece of crap.

41:41.061 --> 41:42.791
That's a beautiful piece of crap.

41:43.589 --> 41:44.589
Thank you.

42:01.291 --> 42:03.019
I'll get the money together somehow.

42:04.757 --> 42:06.907
- I know you will.
- I love you.

42:08.326 --> 42:09.515
I love you, too.

42:11.442 --> 42:12.645
And you know what?

42:13.889 --> 42:16.852
Now that you've gotten
all the way through the game,

42:17.646 --> 42:19.870
you gotta feel
pretty good about that.

42:20.995 --> 42:23.017
Bet you'll sleep better tonight.
