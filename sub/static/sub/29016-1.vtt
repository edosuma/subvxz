Hey, Kate? Um, would it be all right
if I left a little early today?

02:24.778 --> 02:28.147
My brother's moving in with me,
and I want to be there to help him.

It's kind of a busy day.
I think I'm gonna need you here, Barb.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.361
Fine. Well,
if you need me,

02:42.363 --> 02:45.264
I'll be down the hall getting the

02:45.266 --> 02:46.365
There's a cake?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.867

And it's beautiful.

I'll be out for two months.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.942

could prepare all of the documents--

03:06.520 --> 03:09.788
Oh, you don't have to worry about the
Parsons account. I took you off of that.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.624
[chuckles]
What?

03:13.561 --> 03:17.129
- I took you off of it.
- Why would you do that?

03:17.131 --> 03:19.231
'Cause you're having a baby.
It doesn't make any sense.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.467
- You're probably not even coming back.
- I am coming back.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.037
And you can't fire me,
Kate. It's illegal.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.907
I'm not. I'm just saying
your pregnancy is high-risk.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.008
It's considered geriatric.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.744
No one invited you here.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.949
It's a company baby shower.

Um, excuse me, Kate?
I just wanted to introduce myself.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.443
Did you think I was being
a bitch in there?

04:04.445 --> 04:07.012
Oh, um,
I don't know.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.514
But I did read an article
about corporate body language

- Oh, I'm Erin Flemmings. I'm the new financial analyst.

04:21.295 --> 04:24.796
I just want to say I think it's so
impressive how quickly you rose to SVP.

04:24.798 --> 04:28.467
- How did you do it?
- By working my ass off nonstop.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.903
- Oh, okay.
- Also, the guy ahead of me had to take some time off

04:31.905 --> 04:34.106

Oh, you're actually not
supposed to use two condoms.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.627
It's way less effective
than using one.

Fine, get him on the phone.

you left the garage door up,

and there's a lot of
little kids running around.

10:31.498 --> 10:35.467

and it's gonna, you know...

It's a death trap, so...
just close it in the future.

- Yeah, this street gets really busy.

Bye, Sensei Pete.
Later, Maddie.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.390
I'm sorry.
I was late to get her,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.158
and I think she snuck
in here from ballet.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.760
No, she comes in here
every Tuesday.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.995
She's so enthusiastic about it,
I just let her participate.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.997
Okay, thanks. Bye.

12:12.999 --> 12:16.334
Uh, do you have a second?
I'd like you to fill out an order form

12:16.336 --> 12:18.937
for her to be in the proper karate attire.
That's okay?

12:18.939 --> 12:22.073
- Oh, no. I'm not her mom.
- That's fine. It'll only take two seconds.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.009
You know, I just really
don't want to.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.860

So if you leave me alone to do
what it is that I need to do,

12:51.872 --> 12:53.371
I'll leave you alone
to do...

12:54.708 --> 12:56.207
whatever it is
that you do.

Sure.

So, what?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.552
You hate ballet,
but your mother makes you go?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.655
My mom makes me do it,
and I don't want to.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.090
That's what I just said.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.459
They say I need
to have more girlfriends,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.261
that I'm not trying
hard enough, like...

13:16.263 --> 13:18.630
No, I know.
Middle school is really the worst.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.332
You hated it, too?

13:22.169 --> 13:24.903
I was a...
I was an awkward kid.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.174
But then everything got better,
and you're fine now?

13:29.176 --> 13:31.476
Mm-mm. No.
No, I wouldn't say that.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.412
I'm still not great
in group settings.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.848
I have a habit of saying things
that everyone is thinking,

13:36.850 --> 13:39.117
but then someone is always
like, "Why did you say that?"

13:39.119 --> 13:40.819
So I'm usually in this place
where I hate myself.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.655
But I still think I'm better
than everybody else, you know?

13:43.657 --> 13:46.357
So, look, you've probably got
a few shit years ahead of you.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.927
But loser kids often become
very successful people.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.094
So, you know...

13:53.266 --> 13:56.034
At cheerleading, they put me
at the bottom of the pyramids

13:56.036 --> 13:58.102
and make "moo" sounds
when they climb on me.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.539
What?
The noise a cow makes.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.708
No, I know what
noise a cow makes.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.276
You're not doing that
anymore.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.147
Really?
You're not a meat stool.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.115
Have some dignity.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.118
Take control
of your life.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.628
Hi. Yeah, just fill it up.
Thank you.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.464
Can I have money
for snacks?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.500
You just had an entire
chicken Parm meal.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.403
I have to have snacks
Monday through Friday.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.305
I have to have snacks
for school,

14:34.307 --> 14:38.076
snacks for after school,
snacks for TV watching,

14:38.078 --> 14:40.912
snacks for just...
when I feel like snacking.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.480
I have to have
my snacks.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.316
Okay. Fine.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.322
Just... obey your
food sensitivities.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.325
My what? I don't know.
Just get whatever you want.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.001
[door bell dings]

15:19.452 --> 15:21.185
Yo, I like your style.
You're mad hot.

15:23.056 --> 15:26.024
- What?
- Oh, no disrespect, little mommy.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.792
I like a girl
who snacks hard.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.494
I eat mad gummies
all day.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.196
Yeah. I like gummies.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.365
What's your name?

15:34.901 --> 15:36.100
Maddie.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.270
What's yours?

15:39.272 --> 15:42.206
Dennis. My friends
all call me Baby Joker.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.709
Cool.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.520
- You like music?
- Yeah.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.789
What kind you like?

15:57.791 --> 16:00.391
All kinds.
I like all of it.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.696
That's cool, that's cool.
You go to concerts?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.764
Yeah, sometimes.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.132
Which ones?

16:08.735 --> 16:11.402
Um... I forget.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.838
That's cool, that's cool.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.073
[cell phone dings]

16:17.978 --> 16:19.310
Oh, shit.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.479
[rings]

16:21.481 --> 16:23.114
Henry?
[indistinct chatter]

16:23.116 --> 16:24.682
Hi. Uh-huh. Yeah.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.617
I can have those slides
over to you in an hour.

16:26.619 --> 16:27.585
Yeah.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.622
Them purple ones?
Mm-hmm.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.425
There's a story behind those.
A history.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.094
What's the story?

16:36.096 --> 16:39.831
You notice how they were gone?
Like, they went extinct?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.866
They were nowhere to be found?
Mm-hmm.

16:41.868 --> 16:45.603
I wrote to the company for
them to restock the gummies.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.006
Months later, they're back in store.
That was me.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.374
That was me.
Wow.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.876
Yours truly. Baby Joker.
I wrote that.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.544
Yeah. I probably
would've, too.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.380
I was looking into the
future and I was like,

16:55.382 --> 16:57.048
"Man, one day I'm gonna
have my babies,

16:57.050 --> 16:59.650
and they're not gonna be
able to have those snacks."

16:59.652 --> 17:02.587
So I was like,
"I'm gonna..." Oh, thank you.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.741
[Kate] It's so funny. I was driving,
and then you weren't in the car.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.577
So... don't tell
your mom about this.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.578
[Maddie] Okay.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.218
[cell phone ringing]

17:34.220 --> 17:35.486
[beep]

17:37.090 --> 17:39.357
[cell phone ringing]

17:39.359 --> 17:40.825
Yeah, hi.
What?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.927
Hey, I'm just checking in.
What's going on?

17:42.929 --> 17:45.897
I'm just working on my presentation.
The pitch got moved up.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.766
I meant with Maddie.
What... What's she doing?

17:48.768 --> 17:52.103
Uh, I don't know.
<i>What do you mean? Where is she?</i>

17:52.105 --> 17:55.073
I mean, she's here.
I just don't know what she's doing.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.274
She's...

17:56.709 --> 17:58.242
[grunting]

17:59.012 --> 18:00.845
She's fighting with trees.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.614
[howls] Oh,
now she's pretending to be a wolf.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.951
Okay, so she's playing.
You can just say that she's playing.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.454
All right?
You picked her up from ballet okay?

18:09.456 --> 18:12.924
Yeah. By the way, you're really throwing
your money down the drain there.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.293
<i>Oh, come on. Don't be mean, Kate.
She's there to make friends.</i>

18:15.295 --> 18:18.196
Yeah, I just really think she'd
prefer to make friends in karate.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.731
<i>Karate?
No, she's not into that.</i>

18:20.733 --> 18:22.133
Karate is for boys.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.570
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.939
<i>So, Kate, um,
I'm sorry about this.</i>

18:27.941 --> 18:31.642
But actually, we're gonna need you
to stay just a little bit longer.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.645
Cheryl, I can't do that.
That was not part of our agreement.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.714
<i>I know.
I understand that, Kate.</i>

18:36.716 --> 18:38.816
But there's just a lot more
to do here than we thought.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.586
So maybe you could just stay
till the end of the week maybe

18:41.588 --> 18:43.287
<i>and we could pick her up
on Friday after the dance?</i>

18:43.289 --> 18:45.456
I mean... no!

18:45.458 --> 18:47.158
[whispers indistinctly]

18:47.160 --> 18:49.627
Hey, Kate? We don't have a
lot of options here right now.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.563
Okay? Look, I mean,
you know, I wish we did.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.499
I wish I could just
wave a magic wand Joe...

18:54.501 --> 18:57.268
and make Memaw feel better,
but I can't, okay?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.737
[crying] <i>Cheryl's really having
a hard time with all this.</i>

18:59.739 --> 19:02.406
We're...
We're begging you, okay?

19:02.408 --> 19:04.976
Will you please take Maddie
for just a few more days?

19:04.978 --> 19:07.512
We are moving a lifetime of
memories here in this house!

19:07.514 --> 19:09.814
Okay, just stop.
Just stop! It's all right.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.182
Joe, I'll watch her.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.984
Thank you, Kate.
Thank you.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.418
I gotta go.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.990
All right, you take a break.
Go take a break.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.894
Aah!
Honey!

19:24.164 --> 19:25.596
It's <i> my</i> mom!

19:31.704 --> 19:34.505
Your parents aren't
coming home until Friday.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.808
So that means I'm gonna need
you to be very responsible,

19:37.810 --> 19:39.644
and I'm gonna need you
to be very professional.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.945
Do we have an understanding?

19:45.552 --> 19:47.718
Um, Kate?
What?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.722
- I was, um--
- Spit it out.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.058
Can I have a friend over
after school tomorrow?

19:54.060 --> 19:57.061
Is it a nice friend,
or is it one of those cheerleader bitches?

19:57.063 --> 19:58.396
It's a nice friend.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.631
Fine. Whatever.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.467
Thanks, Kate.
You're pretty cool.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.373
[scraping]

20:12.478 --> 20:14.312
Why are you eating it
like that?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.381
I just like the salt.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.819
Please leave me alone.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.659
[cell phone alarm ringing]

20:30.330 --> 20:32.930
Maddie! Maddie, wake up!
We gotta go!

20:32.932 --> 20:34.065
We gotta go!

20:36.436 --> 20:37.935
Okay, good.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.804
[Kate]
Go. Go, go, go.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.077
Go!

20:46.779 --> 20:47.812
Okay.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.082
[starts engine]

20:51.084 --> 20:52.550
[tires screech]

20:52.552 --> 20:54.085
What are you doing?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.520
[Kate] What is she doing?

20:56.522 --> 20:59.123
Yeah, yeah, hi.
I thought I was clear before

20:59.125 --> 21:02.126
when I said that we keep our
garage doors down for our kids.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.895
Okay, well, we can...
I can do that right now.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.464
You can't.
The clicker doesn't work.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.132
I can't.
The clicker doesn't work.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.468
Uh, so get it fixed. Okay?

21:10.470 --> 21:13.638
And in general,
just slow way down.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.406
Time to put
your mommy hat on.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.775
Yeah? Well, it's time
you put some pants on.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.543
Because I can see
your pussy.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.449
[Kate] Have a great day.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.826
[Kate] Okay, bye.
[Maddie] Um, but this isn't my school.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.895
It's not?
No. Mine's down the street.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.331
Okay, I'm really sorry,
but you gotta get out and walk

21:40.333 --> 21:41.732
because I'm very late.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.673
[car alarm beeps]

21:50.243 --> 21:52.076
I really like it here
so far.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.577
Everybody's so nice.

21:54.514 --> 21:57.348
Yeah. Yeah.
It's great you think that.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.417
Shit, shit.
Are they here?

22:01.688 --> 22:04.021
Oh, hello, gentlemen.

22:04.023 --> 22:07.191
Sorry I'm late. I had a...
had a family emergency.

22:07.193 --> 22:08.492
Hmm.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.962
Actually, it was a death.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.165
It was a death.
They're dying as we speak.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.500
If you'd like,
we could call the dying person

22:16.502 --> 22:19.937
and blame them for holding up our meeting.
Would you like that?

22:19.939 --> 22:22.773
Just call the dying person
and ask them to wrap it up?

22:24.544 --> 22:27.044
Okay, let's go have a seat,
sit down. Shall we?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.045
Yeah.
All right.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.186
[Jill] Hey!
You're staying longer.

22:36.322 --> 22:39.056
Let's think about getting
that garage door fixed, okay?

22:39.058 --> 22:41.559
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.561
Also, it's trash night.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.863
It's... It's what?
It's trash night.

22:46.399 --> 22:49.567
Might want to think about
putting your trash out as well.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.136
Where?
Gotta roll the cans.

22:52.138 --> 22:56.741
Roll the cans to the street
for the garbage men. Okay?

22:57.410 --> 23:01.679
You gotta do it. You gotta do it.
'Cause the raccoons come.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.115
And the raccoons
bring ticks.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.752
And there's no cure
for Lyme disease.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.099
[slurping]

23:26.272 --> 23:28.105
- [Maddie] Eww!
- Maddie?

23:30.276 --> 23:31.509
What are you doing?

23:32.044 --> 23:33.711
This is my friend
I was telling you about.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.679
Baby Joker.
What's up?

23:37.183 --> 23:38.716
What is on your face?

23:38.718 --> 23:41.285
Oh, it's juggalo paint.
B.J. showed me.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.620
We're juggalos.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.755
Go wash it off. Okay?

23:45.291 --> 23:47.291
Go wash it off.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.627
And I think it's time
for your friend to go home.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.529
But can't he stay
for dinner?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.698
His mom probably
wants him home?

23:54.700 --> 23:56.634
Nah, my mom works night shifts
at the hospital.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.036
I'm good. I snagged
some taquitos from work.

23:59.038 --> 24:02.072
Ooh, snack time every time.
You never catch me hungry.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.808
Hey, nom-nom-nom.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.876
Want some of this?
Yeah.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.612
Got you two.
They're good, man.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.481
Them puppies are good.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.116
Hey. Yeah,
that's what...

24:12.118 --> 24:13.851
Hey, I like that.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.621
No. Oh, she did
the mustache!

24:17.623 --> 24:20.758
So, Baby Joker,
you say you're a gigolo.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.993
Oh, no, no, no.
Juggalo.

24:22.995 --> 24:26.831
We're fans of the band.
Insane Clown Posse.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.732
Juggalos are all about,
like, no judgment.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.568
Because everybody's a freak
at their core.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.236
Juggalos are a family.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.505
A family of freaks.
We get a bad rap...

24:34.507 --> 24:37.107
because some juggalos be beating
kids up with monkey wrenches

24:37.109 --> 24:39.410
or burning down schools
and shit, but...

24:39.412 --> 24:41.479
but real juggalos
help people.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.848
We live and die
by the juggalo code:

24:43.850 --> 24:45.683
Better respect
or suck a dick.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.118
- Whoop, whoop!
- Whoop, whoop!

24:48.120 --> 24:49.253
Ha!

24:51.023 --> 24:54.291
Oh, my mom
just got off her shift.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.760
I'm gonna go pick her up so
she don't have to take the bus.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.196
Uh, how much is this?

25:00.666 --> 25:02.967
- I got it.
- Hey, thanks.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.935
Later, Maddie.
Bye, B.J.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.074
Where did you meet
that boy?

25:10.543 --> 25:11.942
At the gas station.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.278
When you left me.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.549
I don't know if he's the
best friend pick for you.

25:18.551 --> 25:19.984
You might want
to keep looking.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.052
[gasps] You're being
just like my mom!

25:22.054 --> 25:24.188
She wants me to have
stupid girlfriends,

25:24.190 --> 25:26.390
even though they all hate me
and put me on the shit list.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.392
The what?

25:29.729 --> 25:31.829
The girls in my grade
made a list of all the girls

25:31.831 --> 25:33.631
who look and smell like shit.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.234
Then posted it
all over school.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.371
I came in second.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.142
[Kate] Why does it say
"Maddie Beef"?

25:47.713 --> 25:49.179
I farted in gym once,

25:49.181 --> 25:52.750
so Tim Pizzouli
told everyone I beefed.

25:52.752 --> 25:56.921
Well, at least
you're not number one.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.856
Tara Gavinski
got number one.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.257
See? There you go.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.612
She has cerebral palsy.

26:04.613 --> 26:06.063
Who wrote this? Girls from school.
You don't know them.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.431
Obviously
I don't know them.

26:07.433 --> 26:08.832
Show me a picture.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.203
Let me see it.
Mm-hmm.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.739
That's Kylie Matthews.
Mm-hmm.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.275
Mackenzie Cohen.
Yes?

26:18.277 --> 26:20.411
And Tamara Yushi.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.780
None of these girls have any
business making fun of anyone.

26:22.782 --> 26:25.716
This one right here
with the boobs,

26:25.718 --> 26:27.451
she probably thinks
she's hot shit right now.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.954
But wait a few years.
She'll be a fucking whale.

26:29.956 --> 26:33.424
And this one...
This...

26:33.426 --> 26:35.960
This girl has lazy eye.

26:35.962 --> 26:39.196
Come on.
These girls are dogs.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.166
And you don't smell
like shit.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.036
Can I go get an ice pop?

26:46.472 --> 26:47.471
Yeah.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.729
Do you want a makeover?

27:12.665 --> 27:13.897
No, thanks.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.166
What do you mean,
no, thanks?

27:16.168 --> 27:19.169
Just... no, thanks.
I'm not interested.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.605
You're gonna get
a makeover.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.240
No. Please.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.509
It'll be fun.

27:25.511 --> 27:28.112
What is this?
Self-tanner.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.514
I don't need to be tan.
I'm an indoor kid.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.915
We're gonna change that.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.352
Don't eat it.
Don't eat it.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.088
I'm just gonna clean up...

27:38.090 --> 27:40.124
I'm gonna clean up
a few stragglers.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.626
Um, yeah, I don't...
I don't...

27:42.628 --> 27:44.261
It's fine. You'll thank me.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.030
Okay, here we go.
Here we go. Okay.

27:46.032 --> 27:49.099
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Why would you do that?

27:49.101 --> 27:51.201
[laughs]
Why are you laughing?

27:51.203 --> 27:53.771
Just... Shh.
I'm shutting it down!

27:54.340 --> 27:55.372
I like this one.

27:57.476 --> 27:58.876
No, no.
That's deodorant.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.544
Did you buy
all this stuff?

28:00.546 --> 28:03.047
Yeah. Yeah,
when I started making a lot of money,

28:03.049 --> 28:06.450
I fell pretty hard
into consumerism.

28:06.452 --> 28:09.286
This is my warrior's cloak.
I got it from Lord Keith

28:09.288 --> 28:11.288
at Medieval Times
on my birthday.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.957
This is my weapons of nature
collection.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.261
This one defeats demons.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.830
[howls]

28:19.832 --> 28:21.198
[Kate]
It just happens.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.401
You can either eat
and have a nice face,

28:24.403 --> 28:28.405
or you have a tight ass and
you look like the Crypt Keeper.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.041
Not now, but someday,
you're gonna have to pick.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.811
It's either your face
or your ass.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.048
[Kate] This is
my dating profile.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.751
I'm not on it that often.
This is why.

28:40.753 --> 28:41.985
Ugh.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.287
How's it look?

28:45.558 --> 28:46.824
[Kate] Oh, wow.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.260
Maybe I should use some more
to balance it out.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.263
Please don't.
Get in the shower. Scrub.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.200
The thing is, with bullies,
you just gotta fight back.

28:56.202 --> 28:59.069
Fight back, or they're
gonna keep going.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.505
[grunts]
You gotta fight back.

29:01.507 --> 29:05.109
Fight back and take down
those lazy-eyed bitches. Ha!

29:05.111 --> 29:08.112
I could put a spell on them
so they become wolves.

29:08.114 --> 29:12.182
Maybe. I think if you want
to get off the shit list,

29:12.184 --> 29:14.284
you're gonna have to stop
turning magic tricks.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.587
Magic is my passion.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.594
[school bell rings]

29:31.437 --> 29:33.637
Hyah!
[grunts]

29:44.483 --> 29:45.616
Hey, Dan.

29:46.752 --> 29:47.918
How's it going?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.486
Good. How are you?

29:49.889 --> 29:51.054
Good.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.892
How's everything going
with... Lucas?

29:55.761 --> 29:58.395
It's Liam.
And he's doing fine.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.732
So all the counseling stuff
worked out?

30:01.734 --> 30:03.567
Yeah, it actually did.

30:03.569 --> 30:04.835
Thank you for asking.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.104
We had a few families
move away,

30:07.106 --> 30:09.072
and things seem to have
calmed down now.

30:09.074 --> 30:10.641
So it's a relief.

30:10.643 --> 30:13.477
Good.
Yeah.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.612
So do you have to go around
and meet all the new families

30:15.614 --> 30:18.015
that move into the neighborhood?
What do you mean?

30:18.017 --> 30:21.351
You know, like when someone in your
situation moves into the neighborhood,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.020
they have to go introduce
themselves to all the--

30:23.022 --> 30:25.956
My son is not
a sex offender.

30:25.958 --> 30:29.493
Good. Good.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.995
Hey, Kate, I have those
projections you asked for.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.530
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

30:33.532 --> 30:36.366
Glad to hear things are
going well, Dan.

30:36.368 --> 30:39.136
So... Victus. I've been trying
to score these guys for months.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.138
They're the largest pharma
company on the east coast.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.372
[Barb] Hey, Kate?
Yeah?

30:42.374 --> 30:44.041
A middle school's
on the phone.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.442
Something about
a Maddie?

30:45.444 --> 30:47.711
What do they want?
To talk to you.

30:47.713 --> 30:48.846
About what?

30:48.848 --> 30:50.047
[sighs]

30:50.950 --> 30:52.816
I didn't ask.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.718
Barb, just take a message.
Okay.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.888
I've been trying to get in
front of these guys for a while.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.157
But they're all mostly alcoholics
going through divorces,

31:00.159 --> 31:03.660
so it's been very difficult
to get anybody on the phone.

31:03.662 --> 31:07.197
Um, you know, I'm... Excuse me.
I just have to run to the restroom.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.699
Sure.
Be right back.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.235
Get that school back on
the phone for me right now.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.239
[Barb] Got it.
On line one.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.808
Hi. Yeah, I just got a call
from you guys. What's up?

31:17.810 --> 31:21.411
[woman] <i> Hello, we had an incident
today with Maddie. Can you come in?</i>

31:21.413 --> 31:25.249
Um, I...
I can do like, 8:00 or 8:30.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.184
<i>No, someone needs
to come right now.</i>

31:27.186 --> 31:30.087
Uh... I mean...

31:30.089 --> 31:31.622
I could be there by 1:00.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.726
Is she okay? <i>That's fine.
We'll see you at 1:00.</i>

31:35.728 --> 31:36.894
[phone clicks]

31:36.896 --> 31:38.161
Okay.

31:45.537 --> 31:49.339
Great. Sorry. It's fine.
I agree with everything you're saying.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.575
We have to impress these guys.
Yes.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.511
Which is why I went ahead and scheduled
a lunch with their SVPs for today.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.514
When did you do that?
Yesterday.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.349
Barb said you didn't have anything.
Is that okay?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.785
What time? What time?
1:00 p.m.

32:01.787 --> 32:03.086
Hmm.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.455
Great.
Great.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.258
I figured it was best.
Not too early, not too late.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.694
They won't feel judged
for drinking.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.363
I got a new shirt.
Do you like it? J.Crew.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.499
I used to shop at Old Navy--
Great.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.484
[Erin] I read they have a great Dutch
baby here. [man] What's a Dutch baby?

32:34.486 --> 32:37.154
You've never had a Dutch baby?
Okay, how do I explain it?

32:37.156 --> 32:39.323
I guess it's like,
soft and fluffy.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.758
It's like a pancake that fluffs up.
Okay.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.561
Kind of like a baby.
And you can put toppings on it, you know?

32:44.563 --> 32:46.663
Strawberries, blueberries.
I hate banana.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.900
And you put it in the oven
and-- Excuse me. Excuse me.

32:49.902 --> 32:51.501
I have to use
the ladies' room.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.937
And you put toppings on it,
like powdered sugar,

32:53.939 --> 32:55.605
strawberries, blueberries.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.307
Be right back.
I personally hate bananas.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.508
So I would never put it
on there.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.344
But it's really
dealer's choice.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.146
In Dutch, I believe
they call it <i> panneko-ek.</i>

33:03.148 --> 33:05.148
Or <i> pannekoke.</i>
I don't speak Dutch.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.091
Is everything okay?

33:15.627 --> 33:18.095
No. I'm fucked up.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.497
Oh, really?
Yeah.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.766
I told the waitress to
make mine a Coke and water.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.701
I read it's a smart trick
for female executives

33:24.703 --> 33:27.204
who don't want to feel ostracized
by heavy-drinking clients.

33:28.307 --> 33:31.608
- Smart.
- Are you trying to leave right now?

33:31.610 --> 33:34.177
No. No, I just came out here.
I needed to get some air.

33:36.515 --> 33:41.051
Okay. I'm watching my niece
for the week,

33:41.053 --> 33:43.120
and something happened
at the school.

33:43.889 --> 33:46.356
She's... She's strange.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.191
You can go
if you need to.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.496
- Really?
- Yeah, it's fine. I can get the check.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.499
Thank you. I used to love
drinking with clients.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.135
And now it just makes me
feel kind of sad.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.204
In my heart, you know?

34:01.874 --> 34:04.041
No, not really.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.743
[woman] What are you doing in my car?
Get out! [horn honks]

34:06.745 --> 34:08.879
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Thought you were my Lyft.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.583
- Hello. Hi. Are you--
- Good luck with everything.

34:24.596 --> 34:25.629
[groans]

34:34.572 --> 34:38.175
Hey! What happened?
Are you okay?

34:40.446 --> 34:42.813
What's going on?
What happened?

34:48.120 --> 34:49.652
Sensei Pete?

34:50.688 --> 34:53.356
What are you doing here?
I don't know.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.458
I think Maddie has me down
as her emergency contact,

34:55.460 --> 34:58.261
but I don't know
how she got my phone number.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.364
Uh, Kate, I realize
you're just watching Maddie,

35:01.366 --> 35:04.034
but we had an incident
earlier with bullying.

35:04.036 --> 35:08.271
Again? She has got those
little shits on her tail.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.539
This needs to stop.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.608
I know Maddie's
been picked on,

35:11.610 --> 35:14.144
but I hope you're not
encouraging her to fight back.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.479
Of course not.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.814
Then I'm confused

35:17.816 --> 35:21.485
as to why she would
roundhouse kick Kylie Matthews

35:21.487 --> 35:24.788
and call Mackenzie Cohen
a lazy-eyed bitch

35:24.790 --> 35:28.492
and then mention something
about the juggalo code.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.294
He teaches her
that stuff.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.430
Uh, Maddie is in
my martial arts class,

35:33.432 --> 35:35.565
and I can assure you
that we don't promote violence.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.467
We just do forward rolls
and stuff.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.336
She physically
harmed someone.

35:40.606 --> 35:44.674
Those girls, they make fun
of her because she's plump

35:44.676 --> 35:46.676
and she fights
with trees.

35:48.413 --> 35:52.682
If you punish her,
those little shit girls win.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.351
Let's not call them
little shit girls.

35:54.353 --> 35:55.719
Then how about
terrorists?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.854
Then the terrorists win.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.724
Have you been drinking?

36:01.927 --> 36:03.460
How dare you?

36:03.462 --> 36:05.362
How dare you?
How... No.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.464
I think you have,
because you stink.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.866
Well, I haven't. So, sorry.
Are we done here?

36:09.868 --> 36:13.770
No, not at all. No.
You need to sign this disciplinary form,

36:13.772 --> 36:15.372
and we have to call
Maddie's mom.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.641
Maddie's suspended
for the rest of the day

36:17.643 --> 36:19.042
[gags]
and tomorrow.

36:19.044 --> 36:21.678
[Sensei Pete] Was that puke?
Are you puking?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.680
If you're gonna puke,
don't just sit there.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.949
Get up and go
into the bathroom.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.620
[Kate retching and coughing]

36:33.559 --> 36:34.925
I can take them home.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.899
Mmm.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.235
Feeling better?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

36:45.237 --> 36:48.905
So, I guess I'm supposed to
punish you now? Is that it?

36:48.907 --> 36:50.373
Can I go play
<i>Buck Hunter?</i>

36:50.375 --> 36:52.175
Did you finish
your Parm?

36:52.177 --> 36:53.577
No.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.412
Whatever.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.585
Look, I didn't want
to say anything, but, um,

37:01.587 --> 37:03.687
a roundhouse kick
is a really advanced move.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.922
And I was really proud
when I heard that,

37:05.924 --> 37:09.659
but I couldn't tell her that because,
you know, she took that kid down.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.062
But inside, you were
kind of like...

37:12.764 --> 37:14.331
"Nice."

37:14.866 --> 37:16.666
Yeah. Yeah.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.904
Look, I know she's
technically not in my class.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.174
But I teach a karate expo every
month in a place in Mahwah.

37:24.176 --> 37:25.375
You should bring her.

37:25.377 --> 37:26.710
We don't really hang out.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.612
It's one Tuesday afternoon.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.513
Mm-mm. I gotta work.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.449
And I think she prefers
being alone

37:32.451 --> 37:34.517
and making
weapons of nature

37:34.519 --> 37:36.286
and pretending
that she's a wolf.

37:36.288 --> 37:40.557
I don't really think that, um,
karate can do much for her.

37:40.559 --> 37:41.858
It helped me.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.761
Yeah. I, um...

37:44.763 --> 37:46.730
I had really bad
social anxiety growing up.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.366
And, um,
I couldn't talk to people.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.700
I never left the house.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.836
You were a hoarder?

37:54.206 --> 37:56.806
No. I just...
I was just shy.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.810
I'll talk to her parents about
getting her a karate outfit.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.546
You. You're here every night
with the kid, right?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.949
Mm-hmm. I'm Kate.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.652
You feed her too much chicken Parm.
What?

38:08.654 --> 38:12.222
Parm every night is no good.
You're gonna give her diabetes.

38:12.224 --> 38:14.391
You should do salad,
healthy stuff.

38:14.393 --> 38:15.725
It's not right.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.729
Shit.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.133
Okay. So...

38:24.670 --> 38:26.303
technically,
you are suspended

38:26.305 --> 38:27.837
and you should not be
enjoying this.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.507
But those girls suck.
So let's compromise.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.008
What were you planning
on doing today?

38:33.345 --> 38:35.679
Watch TV,
practice my back kicks,

38:35.681 --> 38:37.647
look up woolly mammoths.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.416
Maybe just one hour
of TV?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.052
Seems fair.

38:43.322 --> 38:45.355
Do not order
from the pizza place.

38:45.357 --> 38:47.357
That guy thinks
I'm neglecting you.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.426
You can get Chinese
instead.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.027
And when does
your cleaning lady come?

38:51.463 --> 38:52.662
What?

38:54.166 --> 38:55.598
[spattering]

38:58.537 --> 39:00.270
Your brother's
on line one.

39:00.272 --> 39:01.705
Got it.
[beep]

39:02.874 --> 39:05.875
Joseph, we really need
to talk about your daughter.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.677
[Cheryl] <i>Oh, my God.
What? What's wrong?</i>

39:08.547 --> 39:11.815
Ju...
Nothing. Nothing.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.550
<i>I have a missed call from the school.
Is everything okay?</i>

39:13.552 --> 39:15.719
It's... It's just
that I thought...

39:15.721 --> 39:19.189
We thought that Maddie
had gotten her period.

39:19.191 --> 39:21.624
But it turns out that
she just sat in ketchup.

39:21.626 --> 39:23.893
So we laughed about it.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.464
<i>- What?</i>
- [chuckling] What's up?

39:27.466 --> 39:29.833
<i>Is Maddie ready
for the dance tomorrow?</i>

39:29.835 --> 39:32.168
Yes. <i>Oh, good.
And you got her a dress?</i>

39:32.170 --> 39:33.737
Yep, she's good to go.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.205
<i>Well,
what did she pick out?</i>

39:36.742 --> 39:39.142
Sequins.
<i>Sequins?</i>

39:39.144 --> 39:41.811
Yeah.
<i>Well, that sounds ridiculous.</i>

39:41.813 --> 39:43.580
No, it's actually
very flattering.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.215
<i>She really needs
to go to this dance--</i>

39:45.217 --> 39:46.916
I'm just pulling up into work.
[continues speaking]

39:46.918 --> 39:49.185
So I will talk to you guys later.
Okay? Bye.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.653
Fuck!

39:50.655 --> 39:53.890
- [Cheryl] <i> What?</i>
- Just... fuck!

39:53.892 --> 39:56.259
Maddie's gonna look
so good in her dress!

39:57.596 --> 39:59.829
Hang up.
[banging on desk]

39:59.831 --> 40:01.097
[sighs]

40:01.099 --> 40:03.099
I'm so sorry. I swear
it was Joe. It was.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.268
It's fine. It's fine, Barb.
It's not you.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.773
Um, also, do you think I
could leave by 5:00 today?

40:09.775 --> 40:13.510
Why? Um, well,
it's actually my birthday.

40:13.512 --> 40:14.911
Happy birthday.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.379
My brother made
dinner reservations,

40:16.381 --> 40:17.847
but he made them
on the earlier side,

40:17.849 --> 40:19.582
and I was hoping
I could beat traffic.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.785
Oh, cool.
Where are you guys going?

40:21.787 --> 40:23.286
Uh, Macaroni Grill.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.687
Eww. Why?

40:27.058 --> 40:29.859
Because it's
our favorite restaurant.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.169
Yeah.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.137
Lemon coconut.

40:42.974 --> 40:46.109
Key lime. Let's do
a salty chocolate caramel.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.711
[Kate thinking] <i> Barb,</i>
<i>you're a good assistant.</i>

40:49.314 --> 40:52.282
<i>Sometimes you...</i>

40:52.984 --> 40:54.884
<i>screw up.</i>

40:56.087 --> 40:57.053
<i>No, that...</i>

40:57.055 --> 41:01.825
You didn't... Hear your new
analyst is really working out.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.627
Erin? Yeah, she's fine.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.030
Heard about
that Victus lunch. Wow.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.901
What about it? She had a
four-hour lunch with those guys.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.804
Very impressive.
They're notoriously impossible.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.840
She had a four-hour lunch
with those guys?

41:16.842 --> 41:20.677
Oh, yeah. Everybody upstairs
is talking about it.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.023
And we might go
to one of those places

41:34.025 --> 41:35.692
where you have a glass
of wine and paint.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.127
I'm feeling naughty,
so I might have two.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.829
Who knows, though?
It's my birthday.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.364
Happy birthday, Barb.

41:41.366 --> 41:43.099
Thank you for all
that you do.

41:45.604 --> 41:46.769
[door slams]

41:47.205 --> 41:48.238
Aww.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.507
Look.

41:50.509 --> 41:51.708
[tweeting]
He real great, man.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.443
He's down with the clown,
man.

41:53.445 --> 41:56.112
Oh, man. I don't know if
he could be a juggalo, man.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.780
What are you talking about?
He's crazy.

41:57.782 --> 42:00.350
You can't paint his face.
He's missing an eye.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.318
You ever heard of
the term "cool cat"?

42:02.320 --> 42:04.821
[holds note] That's the
definition of a cool cat, man.

42:04.823 --> 42:06.356
He could be a juggalo,
man.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.293
[spitting]
[Baby Joker] Ohh!

42:11.696 --> 42:12.962
[spitting continues]

42:14.032 --> 42:15.698
Oh, man,
you gotta do that.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.668
Ooh! [laughs]
Shit!

42:18.670 --> 42:20.136
Oh, no!

42:20.138 --> 42:21.571
Know what's good for you?
What?

42:21.573 --> 42:23.072
Sauerkraut.
Sauerkraut?

42:23.074 --> 42:24.707
Yeah.
Like a hot dog topping?

42:24.709 --> 42:26.042
Nah, the side.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.744
Toppings can't be
sides, man.

42:27.746 --> 42:29.579
But that one's a side.
It's a side in Germany.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.714
[scoffs] What you
know about Germany?

42:31.716 --> 42:34.751
Hey! Maddie!
What are you doing?

42:34.753 --> 42:36.553
Oh, shit.
Your grandma's here.

42:36.555 --> 42:38.655
- What are you doing?
- Just hanging out.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.524
That's Evil Eddie, Scummer Steve.
And you know Baby Joker.

42:41.526 --> 42:44.661
You told me you were gonna be
at home working on your kicks.

42:44.663 --> 42:45.862
She was working
on her kicks here.

42:45.864 --> 42:47.263
[cat meows]
What is that?

42:47.265 --> 42:49.265
It's a cat we found
behind the Dumpster.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.534
- His name is Fartosaurus.
- [Steve] Yeah.

42:51.536 --> 42:53.503
Is it okay?
Hell yeah.

42:53.505 --> 42:57.473
Fartosaurus is a down-ass cat.
Whoop, whoop! Meow, meow!

42:58.243 --> 43:01.010
Maddie, let's go.
Hey, man, that school's bullshit.

43:01.012 --> 43:02.545
Come on, those girls
are mad bitches.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.781
Maddie, she shouldn't
even go there.

43:04.783 --> 43:05.949
Yeah.
Maddie, get in the car.

43:05.951 --> 43:08.451
Hey.
Maddie, let's go. Come on.

43:09.621 --> 43:11.287
Come on. Stop that.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.289
[Steve] Better not grab this thing.
Get... No.

43:13.291 --> 43:16.125
Get in the car. Smack her with that.
Smack her with...

43:16.127 --> 43:17.160
You put that...

43:17.596 --> 43:19.062
Hey, my recorder.

43:19.064 --> 43:21.531
[Baby Joker] Hey, that's
his legendary recorder, man.

43:21.533 --> 43:23.266
Get in the car.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.969
You told me you'd be home.
You lied to me.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.470
I wanted to see my family.

43:28.273 --> 43:30.640
Those kids are not your family.
Those kids are freaks.

43:30.642 --> 43:32.108
Well, they like me.
So if they're freaks,

43:32.110 --> 43:33.876
I guess I'm a freak, too.

43:36.481 --> 43:37.547
Get in the car.

43:37.549 --> 43:38.982
Where are we going?

43:38.984 --> 43:41.050
We're gonna get you
a dress for the dance.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.186
Whoop, whoop!

43:45.824 --> 43:48.091
What about this, huh?
This is great, right?

43:48.093 --> 43:51.094
- This stuff is all stupid.
- You know what?

43:51.096 --> 43:53.596
Some girls never even get to go
shopping because they're poor.

43:53.598 --> 43:54.797
So you should be happy.

43:54.799 --> 43:56.833
Why would that
make me happy?

43:56.835 --> 43:58.401
It just makes me sad
those kids are poor.

43:58.403 --> 44:00.436
[girl] Ugh!
You're not listening to me!

44:00.438 --> 44:02.405
You said we were coming here
to get dresses.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.007
I need them all!

44:04.009 --> 44:05.508
Can I get a pretzel dog?

44:05.510 --> 44:07.343
Not until you
pick something.

44:07.345 --> 44:09.612
But I'm hungry, and I can't
make decisions when I'm hungry.

44:09.614 --> 44:11.848
Okay, so we'll go get dinner afterwards.
What do you want?

44:12.784 --> 44:13.983
Chicken Parm.
No.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.819
You can't eat that
every night.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.421
You have to try
something else.

44:18.423 --> 44:20.823
Fine. Chicken Parm hero.

44:20.825 --> 44:23.693
[girl] But, Mom, I need all these dresses!
Stop ruining my life!

44:23.695 --> 44:25.928
I am not saying it
again. No.

44:25.930 --> 44:27.664
You are such a dumb bitch!

44:27.666 --> 44:29.332
No! You're not
getting all three.

44:29.334 --> 44:31.367
Your mother's been saying
that for the last 30 minutes,

44:31.369 --> 44:33.603
so stop being such a
little shit and pick one.

44:33.605 --> 44:35.104
Nobody here likes you!

44:40.979 --> 44:42.378
Let's go. Let's go.

44:43.314 --> 44:45.314
I think she's
getting security.

44:45.316 --> 44:46.549
I like this.

44:47.619 --> 44:50.219
That's a pantsuit.
Mm-hmm.

44:50.221 --> 44:52.255
I already lied and told your
mother I got you a dress.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.858
I don't want to wear a dress!

44:56.361 --> 44:57.560
Oh!

44:57.562 --> 44:59.028
What are you doing?

44:59.030 --> 45:01.831
I don't like girls' clothes.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.800
Sometimes I don't feel
like a girl at all.

45:03.802 --> 45:05.802
Sometimes
I feel like a wolf.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.738
So you want
the pantsuit?

45:08.740 --> 45:10.473
[funk music playing]

45:26.991 --> 45:29.992
Would you be okay if I
stepped out for a minute?

45:36.201 --> 45:38.267
Wait. Let me
show you something.

45:38.269 --> 45:39.302
Okay.

45:40.538 --> 45:41.604
Pick a hand.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.477
Dang it.

45:48.446 --> 45:49.445
All right.

45:50.115 --> 45:51.347
Keep working on it.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.928
- Kate.
- Hey, Dan.

46:10.301 --> 46:11.734
Can I come in?

46:11.736 --> 46:13.736
Uh, sure.

46:13.738 --> 46:15.438
Would you like
something to drink?

46:15.440 --> 46:16.739
Um, red wine?

46:16.741 --> 46:18.207
We don't have any wine.

46:18.209 --> 46:19.642
Okay, then nothing.

46:20.478 --> 46:21.477
Okay.

46:22.647 --> 46:23.980
What's up?

46:23.982 --> 46:26.816
Um, this weird thing
happened

46:26.818 --> 46:28.284
with my niece earlier.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.319
We were at the mall,
and she just...

46:30.321 --> 46:31.721
[purring]

46:31.723 --> 46:33.122

I can't breathe.

58:30.774 --> 58:33.208
Okay. I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

58:34.712 --> 58:36.612
[woman speaking over PA]

58:39.817 --> 58:41.250
Kate.
What'd the doctor say?

58:44.221 --> 58:45.721
[whispers]
Oh, my God.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.857
Oh, my God! No! My baby!

58:48.859 --> 58:52.060
No! No, I just mean I haven't
spoken to the doctor yet.

58:53.531 --> 58:54.863
God damn it, Kate!

58:55.399 --> 58:56.899
Okay, you can go.
Ohh!

58:56.901 --> 58:58.233
We'll take it from here.

58:58.235 --> 58:59.801
No, I want to
make sure she's okay.

58:59.803 --> 59:01.837
Oh, now you care?
The school called.

59:01.839 --> 59:03.739
You didn't tell me
that Maddie was suspended.

59:03.741 --> 59:05.474
And now she's in the hospital.
So I don't know.

59:05.476 --> 59:06.909
Is she pregnant, too?

59:06.911 --> 59:09.311
No.
I don't think so.

59:09.313 --> 59:10.279
[nurse] Guys?

59:11.148 --> 59:12.748
Maddie's fine.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.416
It was pre-anaphylaxis.

59:14.418 --> 59:17.319
Has she been exposed
to any allergens recently?

59:17.321 --> 59:19.688
Um, I don't know.
What has she been eating?

59:19.690 --> 59:23.225
- Just normal things.
- Like what? Like...

59:23.227 --> 59:26.562
She's been eating eggs,
cereal, chicken Parm.

59:26.564 --> 59:29.097
No. She can't have tomatoes.
That was on the list. That's on the list.

59:29.099 --> 59:31.066
You told me she wouldn't die,
so I forgot about the list.

59:31.068 --> 59:32.935
Okay, how much
did she have?

59:32.937 --> 59:34.836
Just a couple times.
Just five times.

59:34.838 --> 59:37.205
Five ti...
You fed her chicken Parmesan

59:37.207 --> 59:39.441
every single night?
That's gross, Kate.

59:39.443 --> 59:40.943
That's what
she wanted to eat.

59:40.945 --> 59:42.878
[nurse] That'd
definitely explain it.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.447
We gave her epinephrine,
and she's resting now, so you can see her.

59:45.449 --> 59:47.716
Thank you. I would love that.
Thanks so much.

59:47.718 --> 59:51.053
Look, Cheryl, I know you think
that I was a terrible babysitter.

59:51.055 --> 59:53.188
And in many ways,
I probably was.

59:53.190 --> 59:54.923
But I do care
about Maddie.

59:54.925 --> 59:57.459
Then why are we here, Kate?

59:57.461 --> 01:00:00.796
My mother is dying,
and I can't even be with her.

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:03.098
So thank you!
Thank you for your help!

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.567
Joe, I got the name of a counselor
who helped my coworker's kid.

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:07.469
Granted, he was beating up
dogs, so it's different.

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:08.971
But it might help.
Just stop!

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.405
I just want to help.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:12.808
[scoffs] Oh. Since when?

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.077
You never,
ever wanted to help.

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:17.446
You couldn't help me when I
had to put Dad into rehab.

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:20.549
Dad is in rehab?
Yeah.

01:00:20.551 --> 01:00:23.485
And guess who had to do everything
'cause you couldn't be reached?

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.988
Well, I didn't know.
If you'd told me, I would've done--

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.823
You would've what?
I would've done something!

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:29.491
No, no. You would've
written a check. Yes!

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:32.494
I don't want your money, Kate.
I want a sister!

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.102
Guys, we have an area
for families to fight.

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.470
It's on
the second-floor terrace.

01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:46.241
Do you want to go?

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:48.744
No. I don't.

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:16.505
Shit.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.611
You go ahead.
I'm gonna take it slow.

01:01:22.613 --> 01:01:23.945
Okay.
Thanks.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.015
Hey. Jill?

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:30.118
Hello.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:33.855
I'm really sorry
about the garage.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:38.860
And I'm really sorry about
tackling you in front of your kids.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:42.798
I'm sorry, too.

01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:50.672
What are we doing?

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:53.275
- Do you want to come over for a glass of wine?

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:55.410
Okay.

Get out. You're making this up.

Good to see you.

I finally decided to face my

- Joe tell you about the DUI?
- No, he didn't.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:46.188
But I actually meant
all this... all this stuff.

a better father to you.

through some stuff right now.

Hi.

01:05:51.715 --> 01:05:54.816
I just wanted to see if I could
catch Maddie. I wanted to say hi.

01:05:55.953 --> 01:05:57.619
She, um...
She didn't come in today.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:58.720
Oh.

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:00.989
She was in the hospital.

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:03.391
What... What happened?

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.328
I fed her
too much chicken Parm.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.063
Yeah, she's allergic
to tomatoes.

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:09.731
Wow. Okay.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.702
Anyway,
I just...

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.738
thought
you should know.

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:19.708
Hey.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:24.312
[sighs]

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.547
Do you want to do
some karate?

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:32.687
[Kate screams]

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:36.324
What happens
if somebody has a gun?

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.860
Oh, God. Man,
I hate that question.

01:06:38.862 --> 01:06:41.096
It's like... ugh.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:42.597
Yeah, because
you'd be screwed.

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:51.806
Hey, hey. I hate that.

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:53.808

remember a Maddie? Wait.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:56.444
Our checks go through
every single month.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:57.879
You've never seen
our daughter?

01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:59.714
Aside from the first time,
when you met me,

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:01.716
you've never seen her?
Kate, what are you doing here?

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:04.152
Just doing some karate.
Is Maddie with you?

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:06.287
Because I dropped her off at
ballet, and now she's not here.

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:07.989
She doesn't do ballet.
She hates ballet.

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.724
I told her to tell you months ago.
But she comes here.

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:12.861
Who are you, man?
I'm Sensei Pete.

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:14.896
...in her leotard in her dance skirt...
This is my dojo.

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:16.197
I teach
your daughter karate.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.732
You're a black belt?

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:19.234
[all speaking at once]

01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:20.402

That's years of work.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:24.539
It's not like the movies.
You should come in.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.975
I tried when I was a kid.
I got to brown belt--

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:28.643
Where is our daughter?

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.749
- [Cheryl] Stop the car.
- [Joe] God.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:35.750
Okay.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.655
What? This is
a gas station, Kate!

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.424
I know. She's usually
right here by the...

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.926
by the propane tanks.
Oh, that's good.

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:48.063
Hi. Is Baby Joker here?

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:50.365
Who?
Dennis.

01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:53.101
Oh, yeah. He went down
there to the gathering.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.569
Oh.<i> Magic: The Gathering.</i>

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:57.272
Okay. So she's with nerds.
We're good.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:08:00.041
Oh, no, no.
The juggalo gathering.

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:02.644
[gasps] Oh, no.

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:06.347
What? What's a juggalo?

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:08.383
Basically all the horrible
people in the planet

01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:10.752
and multiply that by like,
I don't know, 10,000.

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:13.054
And then put them all together,
getting drunk, eating funnel cakes

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:17.926
and vandalizing public property, and then
you have the Gathering of the Juggalos.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:19.461
Yeah.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:23.865
Okay.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:25.466
Hey, sorry for your loss.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:32.040
Just get in the car!
Come on!

01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:34.542
[Joe] Oh, man.
I always thought I'd be the one

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:35.977
to take her to her first concert.

I was worried about her doing karate.

[Joe] Okay, wait.
This isn't that bad.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:06.474
The guy's shirt
says "Harvard."

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.743
Oh, God.
It says "hatred."

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.947
Where's the entrance?
How do we get in?

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.350
Honey, we should've gotten more cash.
Do you have any cash?

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:18.153
All right, babe. Can you just calm
down, please? We'll figure it out.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.189
[Kate] Maybe it'll be over soon,
and we can just wait this out.

01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:24.292
We're not gonna wait it out! If Mad is in
there, I'm gonna go in there and find her!

01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:27.194
Oh, God.

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:28.496
Yeah, I know.
I saw him, too.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.964
I saw him. All right.
Breathe.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:31.765
Maybe there's just like,
a gate we pay at?

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.102
A gate? There's no sense
of commerce here.

01:09:34.104 --> 01:09:35.703
That guy has a knife in his leg.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:38.106
That is a knife.
Hey, man, you good?

01:09:38.108 --> 01:09:40.375
Yo, you need some wristbands?

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:41.609
Yes, we do.
Do you have an extra?

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:43.344
I got one extra.
Okay.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.712
Two hundred.

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:46.613
Two hundred. Great.
We'll take it.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.950
All right?
That's everything.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:51.286
Just give me the wristband.
Hold on.

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.888
Y'all don't look
like juggalos.

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:57.392
In fact, you look like my mom.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:59.294
And she's a bitch,
and I hate her.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:02.063
Okay, I'm going in there
to get my daughter,

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.898
and she's 11.
No.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.401
- You ain't got no titties.
- [Cheryl] What?

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.536
Grow your ass a pair of titties
and you can come in.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:09.637
[Kate] Hey, excuse me.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:12.707
I have titties.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:13.975

Hey, hey. Use the special

Uh, hi. Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bug you.

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:25.146
- Huh.
- I'm wondering if you've seen a girl.

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:27.815
What'd she look like?
She's 11.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:29.384
No shit?

01:11:29.386 --> 01:11:31.319
You lost your kid.
Man, that's not good.

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.721
No. Why would you bring a kid here?
What's wrong with you?

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:36.557
I didn't bring her here. Why would you
do that? Kids need strong boundaries.

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:38.760
They need to know that you're in charge.
You can't just bring a kid here

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.161
and let them do
whatever they want.

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:41.663
I 100 percent agree
with you.

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:43.665
I'm just asking
if you've seen a...

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.300
Tell me again what she looks like.
A girl.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:46.734
'Cause I'm on a lot of drugs
right now.

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.569
She has brown hair.
Do you have ecstasy?

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:50.338
I think she was wearing...
No, I don't.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.007
Ninjas, ninjettes!

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:55.176

Would you give her a nine?

I'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.204
Um, I'm looking
for my niece.

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:57.572

Her name is Maddie.

01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:59.741
She's here by herself.
She's, uh...

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:01.909
Show us your butthole!

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:04.812
I can't...
I can't do that.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:09.350
She's, um, brunette.
She's kind of tall...

01:13:09.352 --> 01:13:10.818
um, for her age.

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.887
Hold up!
She's looking for a kid!

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:15.957
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I'm looking for a kid.

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:17.792
Um...

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.595
She's 11.
She's kind of tall.

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:23.097
She's like, I don't know.
Like, maybe that tall.

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:25.500
[man] When'd you
last see her?

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.668
Um, her name is Maddie.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.505

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:40.181

01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:58.299
Maddie?

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.002
Hey, you don't see her?

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:03.004
Ohh!

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.139
How's it looking,
Steve?

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:06.808
Oh, that's fucked up, man.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:09.877
Hey! That's her!

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:14.282
Maddie, stop!
Stop making me run!

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.885
Uhh!
Ow!

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:19.487
Maddie.
Get off of me.

01:14:19.489 --> 01:14:20.721
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:26.494
What are you doing here?

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:28.663
I told you.
I'm a juggalo.

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:30.898
[sighs] So, what?

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.767
You're gonna paint your face
like a clown person

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:34.168
until you're unrecognizable?

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:35.236
Yes.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.742
And what else does this
lifestyle change entail?

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:44.145
I'd need a street name.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:47.181
Got it. It's a ton of work
to change your name.

01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:49.750
Requires lots of forms,
just so you know.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:53.621
Sometimes I get
so confused.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:56.691
And then I get upset because
everyone else is so normal.

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:58.226
Maddie...

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.761
nobody is normal.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:03.064
I mean, do you see
where we are right now?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.033
Easy for you to say.
You're perfect.

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:11.839
Maddie, I'm a mess.

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:17.011
I work all the time
to avoid myself.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:19.380
And I never know
what to do with my arms.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.652
My last romantic relationship
was six years ago.

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:27.989
And that was basically because I just
started following this guy around.

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:29.724
You followed him around?

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:31.893
I just kind of put myself
in places he was at,

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.728
and then we'd make out
sometimes. Ugh.

01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:35.997
That's not a relationship.
I know.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.366
Look, nobody knows
what they're doing.

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:44.805
And besides, everyone's
a freak at the core. Right?

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:51.078
Your face is painted.
I know.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.248
A nice girl named Raven
of Sin did it for me.

01:15:55.585 --> 01:15:56.918
And your parents are here.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.587
I know.
You did this to yourself.

01:15:59.589 --> 01:16:00.821
Let's go.

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:06.394
I saw they have
a pretzel stand.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.062
You want some salt?

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.698
No, I get it, guys.
I followed Phish for like, three months.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.934
Billy Joel's Storm Front Tour.
Great stuff.

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:15.703
So, you guys like,
take time off work?

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:18.406
Oh, my God! Baby, hi.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.707
Oh, I was so worried.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.609
Is she okay?
She's okay, right?

01:16:21.611 --> 01:16:24.111
Was she in one piece?
Sensei Pete!

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:26.113
[Joe] Okay, now,
you're in so much trouble.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:28.316
Who... Who are
all these kids?

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:30.952
Those are Maddie's
new friends.

01:16:32.455 --> 01:16:34.088
We were only gone
a week, Kate.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.756
I know they look
offensive

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.258
and they play
with their spit

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.226
and all their songs are
about stabbing people

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:41.562
and they have no intention
of fitting into society

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:44.131
- and they work at places like Lids.
- That's too many things.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:45.967
But once you get past
all that,

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:48.369
they're really
kind of sweet.

01:16:52.075 --> 01:16:53.307
Okay. I...

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.211
I didn't mean
to be hard on you.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:59.280
I just really want Maddie
to have friends.

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:01.649
I just don't want it to be hard
for her like it was for me.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.217
Maddie is perfect.

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:08.322
All she needs is you.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:16.430
You really stink.
And you look terrifying.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:18.499
Yeah, I know.
I know that I do. Let's go.

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:19.667
Let's go!

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:21.502
Bye, B.J.
Later, Maddie.

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:22.637
I got a tattoo.

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:23.738
Oh, come on.
What?

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.239
Is she serious?

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:27.008
Are you serious?
It's removable.

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:28.843
Later, Throat Slasher.
Bye, guys.

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:30.478
Peace.
See ya.

01:17:40.957 --> 01:17:42.990
[Kate] Hey, Sarah?

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:45.526
I wanted to give you these.

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:47.495
They're the projections
we're gonna be using

01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:50.031
on the Parsons account
for the next six months.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.367
So you will be all up to speed
when you get back.

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:55.102
Thanks.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.205
Hey.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.344
We're skipping out early
to grab a bite.

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:04.378
You want to come?

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.848
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:11.786
- Where are you guys going?
- Mahoney's.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.320
Why? That place sucks.

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:14.855
Well, that's where
we're going.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.557
Okay, cool.

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:18.559
Cool, I'm just gonna go
grab my stuff.

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:22.063
- Don't leave, okay?
- Hurry up.

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:27.902
Hey, Barb. I'm taking off
early with Dan and Sarah.

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:29.970
So if you want to head
out, you can. Oh.

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:32.306
I just need you to clean
up my office before you go.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:33.307
Oh.

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:42.983
Bruce!

01:18:44.487 --> 01:18:45.820
Hey.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:49.557
Erin, how's it going?
It's great.

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:52.159
You got that big
presentation tomorrow. Yeah.

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:54.395
All right, well,
try and get some sleep.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.197
You're gonna do great.

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:58.933
But no so great
if you don't sleep at all.

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:01.202
I hate this.
Okay.

01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:02.303
Hey, guys.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.606
Um, I'm ready.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:14.715
Hi.
[Joe] Hi.

01:19:14.717 --> 01:19:15.816
Hi.

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:19.453
So, I forgot the salad,
but I brought you some wine.

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.022
Ooh, that's a lot of wine for an
afternoon, but let's dance.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:24.425
Well... Hey. Hi.
Hi.

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.761
Are you hungry now?
Do you want some cheese or something?

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.796
Uh, no, I'm good.
My assistant and I

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:30.898
had a big lunch at Macaroni Grill.
Huh?

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.099
It was all right.
Mmm.

01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:35.269
Wow! Looking sharp.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.804
I made some new weapons.
Do you want to see?

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:38.405
Oh, Maddie,
Aunt Kate just got here.

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:40.141
Let's let her relax a little bit.
No, I do.

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.643
I want to see your new weapons.
Let's go.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:45.479
[Cheryl] Have fun, but don't get too dirty.
We're gonna eat soon.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:46.781
Let's see.

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:48.816
Oh. Nice.

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:50.317
This one's mine?
Mm-hmm.

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:51.352
Okay.

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:54.955
How are those
mean girls doing?

01:19:55.725 --> 01:19:57.124
Hmm, they've been dormant.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.226
Really?
That's pretty good.

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:02.596
Did you go see
Sensei Pete yesterday?

01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:03.664
Maybe.

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:05.399
[grunting]

01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:08.135
Just not so hard this time.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:10.771
Why?
You jealous of my moves?

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:12.339
'Cause I'm scared of you.

where you come from.

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:46.373
It's about showing respect
and love to everybody, man.

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:49.543
I think the family term comes
from when people gather like this.

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:52.046
Individually, you're a juggalo.
But when we gather together,

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:53.881
everybody has
each other's back.

01:20:53.883 --> 01:20:56.116

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:03.190
In my mind, juggalo is like,
the way you love, the way you live.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:05.159
It ain't got nothin' to do
with all the negative things

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:06.527
that everybody
make it out to be.

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:08.662
[boy] I'm raised
like a juggalo, but...

01:21:08.664 --> 01:21:11.966
I ain't that clear
what a juggalo is right now.

01:21:11.968 --> 01:21:15.536
I was born a juggalo, but I didn't
find out till I was 16 years old.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.504
Everybody that's
a fuckin' juggalo is here.

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:19.573
They might not know
till they're 30, 40, 50.

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:22.643
You can't really explain a juggalo, man.
You really can't.

01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:24.211
These motherfuckers
are random as shit.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:26.714
[man] I remember
my very first time

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:29.416
I actually got invited
to like, a juggalo party.

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:32.653
You know, I'm a big guy.
Like, they fuckin' just accept me.

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:34.989
I remember one juggalo told me,
he was like,

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:37.091
"The bigger you are,
the more to love."

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:39.593
And I was like, "What?"
This is not a gang.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:41.829
This is fuckin' beautiful.
This is family.

01:21:41.831 --> 01:21:45.199
Don't forget: When you're at the
gathering of the motherfuckin' juggalos,

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.101
call your mom.
Call your mom.
