WEBVTT

00:00.435 --> 00:01.697
- Previously,
on "Winter House"...

00:03.046 --> 00:05.092
What the ----in' sh--
is this?

00:05.135 --> 00:06.484
- Go.
Get outta here!

00:08.095 --> 00:09.574
- Coffee for my ladies.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.620
- I'm like, if you're in love
with me, just say it.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.276
- You guys think anyone
is trying to talk to Gabby?

00:15.319 --> 00:17.060
- I know Gabby so well.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.583
You should put in
some alone time with her.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.759
- I didn't know if she was,
like, talking to Luke.

00:20.803 --> 00:24.067
- I like guys that don't mind
getting their hands dirty.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.503
- If I need to, I can
catch fish out of my lake

00:25.547 --> 00:27.679
and eat 'em.
- Luke is that man.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.203
- I just saw these emails.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.032
- We're on vacation.

00:32.075 --> 00:35.252
You haven't taken me on a trip
in so many years,

00:35.296 --> 00:36.645
and you're working.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.650
- Like, there's something
about a guy that, like,

00:41.693 --> 00:42.955
can make you laugh.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.175
- Let's get this party
started!

00:45.219 --> 00:47.047
Ahh!
- Hubbs!

00:49.571 --> 00:50.746
- Hmm.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.663
- We ----ed.
- We ----ed.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.058
- I'm in love with you.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.583
- I didn't know that.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.766
Lins, I love you...

01:13.943 --> 01:18.295
like a sister.

01:18.339 --> 01:22.082
It just works so much better,
you know, this way.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.866
I don't want this
to be ----ed up

01:23.909 --> 01:26.173
because we are too close.

01:26.216 --> 01:29.089
- So, Lindsay always kinda
kept it a mystery for me,

01:29.132 --> 01:30.481
but did you know
they had sex?

01:30.525 --> 01:32.962
- I knew because
I know them both so well,

01:33.005 --> 01:34.268
but they never told me.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.009
- Listen,
you have to understand.

01:37.053 --> 01:41.013
You dropped bombs
on New Year's Eve.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.102
- What'd I say
New Year's Eve?

01:42.145 --> 01:44.104
- We talked 15 times
on FaceTime.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.106
I said, "What are your goals,
Austen?

01:46.149 --> 01:47.585
"2021,
what are you goals?"

01:47.629 --> 01:49.935
And you go, "I'm gonna
date you this year, Lindsay."

01:49.979 --> 01:51.981
- Okay.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.417
- And that, like,
put sh-- in my head.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.637
You know what I mean?
- Okay.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.466
Every New Year's,
I'm at Madison Square Garden

01:58.509 --> 02:00.598
at a four-day
Phish show.

02:00.642 --> 02:03.123
What am I doing at
a Phish show, Lins?

02:03.166 --> 02:08.128
My head is in outer space,
and she knows it.

02:08.171 --> 02:10.652
Like, come on.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.523
That comes from a place
of, like,

02:12.567 --> 02:13.785
where, like,
I don't know.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.005
- I'm going-- no,
there's no confusing that.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.789
"I'm going to date you
in 2021."

02:17.833 --> 02:19.443
There's no confusing that.
- Will you talk--

02:19.487 --> 02:23.273
- I have a feeling Austen
wants to put me on a shelf

02:23.317 --> 02:26.233
and save me for later
until he's ready.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.712
- You and I have a past.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.758
- Yeah, but forget about
the past, Austen.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.282
I see you for
the first time in a year.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.502
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm just, like,

02:34.545 --> 02:35.894
so elated.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.897
I'm not a backburner girl.
I'm a front burner girl.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.465
So, you either, like,
strike when the iron's hot,

02:41.509 --> 02:43.250
or get off
the ----in' pot.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.338
- When I got here,
I was like

02:44.381 --> 02:46.296
Lins is, like,
that type of friend.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.037
Like, we can, like,
lie in my bed

02:48.080 --> 02:49.299
and watch a movie
and not have to worry.

02:49.343 --> 02:52.563
I don't wanna, like,
ruin some friendship.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.348
- If you're talking to
someone on the phone every day,

02:54.391 --> 02:56.263
and then they always
used to just, like,

02:56.306 --> 02:57.873
stay in the same bed
or whatever.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.228
- No way.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.231
He really is an idiot.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.493
- So, what?
- Yeah, so-- so, what?

03:09.537 --> 03:13.889
- So, we just
resume friendship.

03:13.932 --> 03:17.022
- Okay.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.199
Do we shake hands now?

03:19.242 --> 03:21.331
- No.

03:21.375 --> 03:25.944
We hug like we always do.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.251
- Yeah.

03:31.776 --> 03:32.908
- All right, shall we?

03:32.951 --> 03:34.301
- Tally-ho.
- We shall.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.918
- I love Jason so much.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.572
- He showered in our shower,
and he was like,

03:44.615 --> 03:46.051
"Can you just get me
a towel?"

03:46.095 --> 03:47.270
And I was like, "Yeah,
I just have to run downstairs,

03:47.314 --> 03:49.141
"and then I'll bring it up."
And he was like,

03:49.185 --> 03:50.360
"You're gonna bring it up
for me?"

03:50.404 --> 03:52.406
And I'm like,
"Or you can walk out naked."

03:52.449 --> 03:54.799
- Why not Jason?

03:54.843 --> 03:55.713
- For me?
I'm sorry.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.411
I'm obsessed
with my husband.

04:00.979 --> 04:04.374
How about you and Jason?

04:04.418 --> 04:05.897
I think he really
likes Gabby.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.466
- If I wasn't,
I would.

04:09.510 --> 04:10.554
- It's not all about you.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.556
- Take the ring.
The fight is on.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.863
- Don't mind if I do.
- Oh, she got it first.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.299
- Kyle doesn't come
with the ring, does he?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.692
- Oh, God, no.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.041
- Whatever.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.304
I just wanna make out
with the Italian tonight.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.442
- Honey, we're home!

04:29.965 --> 04:31.314
- What's up?

04:31.358 --> 04:34.099
- Did you see the igloo
that Luke made?

04:34.143 --> 04:35.579
- Well, it's started.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.103
I need to have these big,
strong men help me with it.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.540
- Okay.
- Do it tomorrow.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.584
- It would have been
really good if you were like,

04:40.628 --> 04:42.151
"No, no, no, not you."

04:42.194 --> 04:43.326
- How was, um... ?

04:43.370 --> 04:44.849
- Fat tire biking,
it was really cool.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.198
It was really beautiful.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.375
Lots of conversations were had.
That's for sure.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.160
- Can you fill her in,
so she can fill us in?

04:51.203 --> 04:52.379
- Totally.
- Whatever.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.902
Only tell me
what you want.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.295
- I have an announcement!

04:55.338 --> 04:56.731
I have a keg
being delivered.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.602
We're gonna have
a cold beer bash,

04:58.646 --> 05:02.171
and you're pairing up
with a drinking buddy.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.347
Gabby, will you be
my drinking buddy?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.393
- I am part Irish.
- Me, too. I think.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.481
Gotta check the lineage.

05:07.524 --> 05:08.960
- You're my partner.
- Okay, love it.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.135
- Okay.
- All right.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.398
Everyone, get ready.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.921
- All right.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.488
- You with Amanda?

05:14.531 --> 05:16.054
- Amanda doesn't really
drink beer,

05:16.098 --> 05:17.229
so that should be
interesting.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.361
- Yeah, well you're not
allowed to work.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.797
It's vacation,
so it's time to party.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.233
- Shh-- uh...

05:21.277 --> 05:23.584
- If Kyle stops working so much,
will you party more?

05:23.627 --> 05:25.281
- Are you still working?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.762
- I know I've been, like,
stressing you out late at night

05:27.805 --> 05:29.372
'cause, like, anxiety attacks
and not sleeping.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.634
- Dude, it's, like,
the worst.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.288
I wake up in a bad mood
every day.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.811
- Aww.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.554
- I think these first
couple days in Vermont

05:37.598 --> 05:39.382
haven't gone
how I thought it would

05:39.426 --> 05:41.166
and how Amanda
thought it would.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.343
I've been super
high maintenance.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.170
I've been stressed.
I've been anxious.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.346
- It'll get better.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.999
- Also, not helping
the situation is,

05:48.043 --> 05:50.219
right before we got here,
we were trying to, like,

05:50.262 --> 05:52.395
rearrange our entire wedding.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.702
Things are stressful.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.965
- I need a hand.
- Oh, yes!
- I'll go get it.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.923
- Hold on. Hold on.
That's a six barrel.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.142
That's, like, 41 beers.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.404
- This is just
to get us started.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.145
- It's a lot, 41 beers.
- Forty-one beers?

06:03.188 --> 06:04.929
- It's gonna send me
to the hospital, 41 beers.

06:04.973 --> 06:10.500
- Get your ass inside.
God almighty.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.241
- You think I should put
my makeup on?

06:12.284 --> 06:16.419
- No, you look fantastic.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.812
- I have to get out
of my head.

06:17.855 --> 06:18.856
- Are you in your head
about, like,

06:18.900 --> 06:20.554
the breakdown
of you and Austen?

06:22.338 --> 06:23.818
- I can look at him
and, like,

06:23.861 --> 06:26.864
be on the same page
with him immediately by--

06:26.908 --> 06:28.170
by an eye contact.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.302
- No sh--.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.391
- Please, come in.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.957
- Please.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.090
- Why?

06:35.133 --> 06:38.093
- I don't know.

06:38.136 --> 06:41.488
- Look, she is in love
with me.

06:41.531 --> 06:44.012
Like, just said that to me

06:44.055 --> 06:47.407
and, like, in my opinion,
had no right to say that.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.843
You should know the fact
that you know everything

06:48.886 --> 06:51.541
about my ex-relationship,
and you should know

06:51.585 --> 06:53.891
that I am in no place
for somebody,

06:53.935 --> 06:56.198
especially my best friend,
to come out of left field

06:56.241 --> 06:58.548
and ----in' tell me
that they're in love with me.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.376
Madison, I love you
so ----ing much.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.899
It, like, hurts.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.684
You know, give me
another chance.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.468
- That's not an option.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.514
- Why is it like this
with you guys?

07:07.557 --> 07:10.821
- Because we have
hooked up.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.954
When that happened,
in my opinion,

07:12.997 --> 07:14.999
we-- we moved on.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.697
- If you guys wanna
figure your sh-- out...

07:18.525 --> 07:22.398
I'm, like, more than happy
to take a step back.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.226
You're not interested
in her at all?

07:24.269 --> 07:26.576
- If she was standing
right here in the room,

07:26.620 --> 07:29.100
I'd be like,
"Lindsay, no.

07:29.144 --> 07:32.974
"I do not have any interest
in you at all."

07:33.017 --> 07:35.280
- Just stop, like,
getting drunk

07:35.324 --> 07:36.456
and saying sh-- to me.

07:36.499 --> 07:37.892
- Yeah.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.546
- Maybe you're just,
like, trouble.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.982
- No, maybe
you're trouble.

07:44.507 --> 07:48.076
- You're cute.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.516
- Ha-ha!
Just what the doctor ordered.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.869
- Babe, I just looked at
the Loverboy espresso packaging.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.133
- It's good.
Don't be too excited.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.658
- Sorry.

08:04.701 --> 08:08.400
- Just trying to ----in'
keep things afloat.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.054
- So, Gabby's your
drinking partner?

08:10.098 --> 08:11.142
- Yeah.
- Fun.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.492
- But at the same time,

08:12.535 --> 08:13.971
I asked the guys about Gabby,
and I'm like...

08:14.015 --> 08:15.799
She's talking to Luke,
and I'm like...

08:15.843 --> 08:18.454
Is that a thing?
Is that not a thing?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.716
- Yeah, I don't know.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.588
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:21.631 --> 08:22.719
- What are you reading?

08:22.763 --> 08:24.808
- Um, communication skills
training.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.941
It's just, like, how--
which actually kinda works

08:26.984 --> 08:28.638
'cause there's so many
personalities in the house.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.684
It's just how to handle
different people.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.120
- What are your notes
over there?

08:32.163 --> 08:33.861
- This is something
that I do every day.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.950
It's like, close my eyes,
and pick a random note.

08:35.993 --> 08:36.951
- Oh.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.387
- And I kinda live by
that note

08:38.430 --> 08:39.867
to help me get through
the day.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.434
- Wow. What if the note
was, like, eat five pizzas?

08:42.478 --> 08:43.827
- I would eat five pizzas
for you.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.568
- That's actually really funny.

08:45.612 --> 08:46.569
- And I would really go
work out after that.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.397
- I would like that note.
I think.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.659
- Bye.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.053
- Hi, cutie.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.794
- What's up?

08:53.837 --> 08:56.579
My dream has always been
marry an American girl

08:56.623 --> 08:57.972
and move back to Italy.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.018
- Yeah.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.107
- That's where I wanna
raise my family.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.632
I'm a mama's boy,
and I'm an only child,

09:05.675 --> 09:07.068
so I feel guilty

09:07.111 --> 09:08.809
because I'm on
the other side of the world.

09:08.852 --> 09:11.072
But right now,
I just wanna have fun.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.903
- You can shower
in our room, too, if it's...

09:23.650 --> 09:25.913
- I really miss Natalie,

09:25.956 --> 09:27.610
and now it's kind of
starting to get weird

09:27.654 --> 09:29.090
not having her here.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.135
My friends have people
that they wanna hang out with

09:31.179 --> 09:32.702
more than me.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.966
This is gonna
be my friend.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.621
I'm just here
left by myself.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.970
- All right.
So, what's the plan?

09:40.014 --> 09:41.711
- So, we'll have beers
and stuff outside,

09:41.755 --> 09:43.757
so you might wanna,
like, light layer.

09:45.846 --> 09:50.938
I'm wearing my...

09:50.981 --> 09:52.766
You have 25
to a half hour.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.379
Mmm. Yes.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.076
- How was your day
with Luke?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.077
- I don't know.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.601
There's an attraction
for sure,

10:01.644 --> 10:03.777
but now I'm just like, do--
- You're in the gray area.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.648
- Yeah.
- Ladies?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.345
Ladies of the night?

10:07.389 --> 10:09.434
- This is a girls room.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.305
Wait. We'll come out
in a second.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.611
We wanna finish this.

10:13.961 --> 10:14.875
- No.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.224
- You're just like--
- No.

10:16.267 --> 10:19.444
- Gabby and I have known
each other for ten years.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.143
We've seen each other
through a lot of relationships.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.101
I was hoping
she'd be into Jason.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.669
I mean, it would have been
fun to play matchmaker

10:26.713 --> 10:28.976
with my friends
but not happening.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.934
Squash that.
Moving on.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.632
Would you ever just
ask him straight up,

10:32.675 --> 10:34.111
or do you want me to?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.635
Is it better if it comes
from me being like,

10:35.678 --> 10:37.114
"So, what do you think
about Gabby?"

10:37.158 --> 10:38.768
- If you do it like that,
that's fine.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.336
- He's definitely, like,
a hard ----in' shell to crack.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.513
- Beer bash 2021!

10:44.556 --> 10:46.689
- Beerfest, here we go.
- What's up?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.299
- One, two, three!

10:51.651 --> 10:52.956
- Hey, you gotta drink that.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.176
You gotta drink the beer,
Andrea!

10:55.219 --> 10:57.482
- Beer bash 2021!

11:09.538 --> 11:10.582
- You got it
all the way?

11:10.626 --> 11:12.584
- No.
- Bro, turn it all the way.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.630
What are you, sparing
the propane, bro?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.327
Ha-ha!
- I am.

11:16.371 --> 11:17.285
- How was your day?

11:17.328 --> 11:19.200
- Um, it was,
I mean, good.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.725
- Well, guys, I have
to finish my shot.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.596
Cheers me.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.511
Okay, ready.
Five, six, seven.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.861
- And eight.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.647
- All right, cheerio.
- Yeah, let's go. Cheerio.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.693
- Cheerio.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.303
- Where is Kyle?

11:35.346 --> 11:37.435
- Like, when you can look
at somebody in their eyes

11:37.479 --> 11:41.222
and, like, communicate
through your eyeballs,

11:43.093 --> 11:45.226
Austen and I have that.
- Yeah.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.881
- It's very different
and, like, special.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.320
- Just know I'm
here no matter what.

11:55.627 --> 11:56.628
- Just take your shot
and let's just...

11:56.672 --> 11:59.196
shut the up.
- Yeah.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.503
I'm here for you.

12:02.896 --> 12:03.897
- Coming up...

12:03.940 --> 12:05.376
- I think Paige
is a good girl.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.770
I like her a lot, but I
kinda like being by myself

12:07.814 --> 12:09.729
and be a single guy.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.691
- Whoo!

12:15.735 --> 12:16.823
- Do I smell like beer?
- Yeah.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.433
- I taste like beer.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.872
- What's up?

12:22.916 --> 12:24.613
- Let's go.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.795
- Unclamp, sip, sip.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.757
- I've lost full control.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.628
- Come through, Jason.
Come on, boy.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.021
- All right,
real talk, though.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.588
So, y'all--
y'all never hooked up.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.547
- No, I will
never want to.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.070
You know, when there's
so many people you adore.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.680
- He's so awesome
that I just feel like--

12:48.724 --> 12:50.160
- He is, but it's
just some things

12:50.204 --> 12:52.815
that you love so much
you would never want to ruin.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.774
I don't wanna
ruin a friendship.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.863
- She told you
how she feels.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.865
- I love him as a brother.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.040
- Like, what the [BLEEP]?

13:00.083 --> 13:01.781
Gabby and I were vibing.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.043
- You have nice toes.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.131
What's wrong with this?
- I like yours, too.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.481
But if that's how
she wants to feel,

13:06.524 --> 13:08.309
we can be friends.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.745
- Wait. Is this a selfie?
- Okay.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.225
- We can make it one.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.661
- This helmet,
please keep it on.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.881
- Forever.

13:14.924 --> 13:18.798
- Aye-aye-aye-aye
- aye-aye-aye.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.495
- I know when
I meet a guy,

13:20.538 --> 13:22.758
and I'm nervous, that I--
- Butterflies.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.281
- Yeah, that I like him.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.588
I get, like, I get giddy.
- Am I cute? Am I tan enough?

13:26.631 --> 13:28.285
Like, am I--
- If he even walks into a room,

13:28.329 --> 13:30.635
I'm like-- are you
trying to listen to us?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.855
- No.

13:32.899 --> 13:33.943
- Do you just wanna
bring me a chip?

13:33.987 --> 13:35.423
- Of course.
I had some chips.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.251
I just wanted, uh,
to be nice to the ladies.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.253
- I'm definitely starting
to miss my boyfriend,

13:39.296 --> 13:41.255
especially with people
coupling up in the house,

13:41.298 --> 13:44.693
but this is my time to
drink with my girlfriends

13:44.736 --> 13:46.347
and just have fun.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.871
Just because I have a boyfriend
doesn't mean I can't be fun.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.220
- Whoo!

13:50.264 --> 13:52.788
- I'll get up
in this bitch.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.311
- Start your engines.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.012
- Whoo!

14:08.978 --> 14:10.850
- Oh, my God!

14:10.893 --> 14:13.461
- Kyle!

14:13.504 --> 14:14.984
Kyle!

14:15.028 --> 14:18.596
- I know, I mean,
I'll sign up for that.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.077
- One of the biggest things
that we talk about as a couple,

14:21.121 --> 14:24.428
is how we need to spend time
together not working.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.648
He's working all day,
and then when he's done,

14:26.691 --> 14:29.042
Kyle just wants to be part of,
like, the boys group.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.482
- I'm over here.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.620
- Yes!

14:42.664 --> 14:44.709
- Whoo!

14:48.496 --> 14:49.845
- Wow, buddy.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.847
No, you gotta turn
the other way.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.675
Give me your hand.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.856
- Kyle!

15:00.900 --> 15:03.380
I tried.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.908
- Julia doesn't even want
Luke because she has a man.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.910
It's just the need
for attention.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.563
- Oh!

15:12.607 --> 15:14.478
- And you know what?

15:14.522 --> 15:17.612
I'm not surprised that this
is what Julia is doing.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.444
- Yeah.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.840
- Whoo!
- Ahh!

15:31.408 --> 15:33.671
- How are you?
- I'm tired. Yeah.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.630
- How is everybody doing?

15:37.110 --> 15:39.068
- Well, I need to vent.
- What's going on?

15:39.112 --> 15:41.592
- With Kyle, there is,
like, no happy moments.

15:41.636 --> 15:45.727
Kyle needs to do
something nice for me.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.076
- Hey!

15:50.993 --> 15:53.561
- Where is Amanda?
- I don't know.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.650
- I gotta find Amanda.
- All right.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.743
- Where is my fiance?
What the hell?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.223
Am I losing my mind?

16:04.572 --> 16:05.877
Where is Amanda?

16:10.404 --> 16:13.189
Has anyone seen Amanda?
- No.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.843
- Do you want me
to try to find her?

16:14.886 --> 16:17.193
- I just checked
every bedroom.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.021
- I'll help you look.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.762
- Should we be
concerned, though?

16:22.851 --> 16:25.462
Ciara?
- Let's go.

16:25.506 --> 16:29.249
- Wow, buddy, it's raining
on these beautiful wood floors.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.207
Unreal.
- I'll get the runoff.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.296
- Is there something
more going on?

16:33.340 --> 16:37.126
- Yeah, we've been through
the worst roller coaster ever

16:37.170 --> 16:40.129
with our wedding,
and just...

16:47.049 --> 16:48.268
I mean, the situation,
like, right now,

16:48.311 --> 16:50.835
when I can't find her,
I'm just, like--

16:50.879 --> 16:53.099
I'm, like, worried,
'cause I'm, like, did--

16:53.142 --> 16:55.797
did I not pay her
enough attention?

16:55.840 --> 16:58.147
- Do something that shows me
that you're thinking about me.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.931
- Is Amanda legit missing?

16:59.975 --> 17:01.803
- Yeah. Amanda!

17:06.460 --> 17:08.462
- Literally, Kyle is
about to call the police.

17:08.505 --> 17:09.724
- Where is she, right now?

17:09.767 --> 17:10.899
- We're going straight
to the kitchen.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.205
- I know.

17:12.248 --> 17:12.640
- We're gonna take a
shot of Fireball, okay?

17:12.683 --> 17:13.641
- Stay.

17:13.684 --> 17:14.859
- Why? You know
where she is?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.644
- No, but I'm about
to ----in' find her.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.778
- Oh, yeah.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.742
- What are you doing?
You're scaring Kyle.

17:27.785 --> 17:28.308
- I found her!

17:28.351 --> 17:29.483
- I scared Kyle?

17:29.526 --> 17:30.832
- Yeah, he couldn't
find you anywhere.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.226
Next time let him
know where-where you are.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.146
- Oh, Cookie.
- I got her.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.496
- Why are you crying?
- Where have you been?

17:42.539 --> 17:45.020
- I was in the bathroom.
- Which one?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.500
- The down-- our bathroom.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.937
- You only-- you only
go there when you poop.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.504
No one looks there.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.028
- It was the only place I felt
like I would have privacy.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.638
- I couldn't find you.

17:54.682 --> 17:57.206
No, I just got,
like, so emotional.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.903
- Why?

17:58.947 --> 18:02.037
- 'Cause I love you,
and I wanna party with you.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.387
- You wanna party with me?
- Yeah, it'd be nice.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.476
- People tell me I'm,
like, kind of a good time.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.218
- People tell me
I'm kind of a great time.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.873
- Despite the issues
Kyle and I have,

18:11.916 --> 18:14.876
whether it's how much he works
or how much he complains,

18:14.919 --> 18:16.225
at the end of the day,

18:16.269 --> 18:18.923
we, unfortunately, love
each other way too much.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.360
- Well, guess what.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.190
- Okay.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.279
- Wow, buddy!

18:26.322 --> 18:28.803
We've destroyed this house.
- We got turnt.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.505
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.250
- I can't find my phone.
Don't know where it is.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.692
- Do you have my beanie?
-

18:48.736 --> 18:50.694
- No, I never
had a hat on.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.281
- Oh.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.374
- Pay attention
to your drink.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.985
- Are you guys taking
Fireball without me?

19:21.029 --> 19:22.770
- I'll take another. Go.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.467
- Oh, yeah, bitch.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.690
- How are you doing?
- Awesome now.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.308
- Hey, turn the lights on.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.571
- I think Gabby
is mad at you.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.617
Because you were
dancing with Luke.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.540
- Coming up...

19:53.583 --> 19:55.237
- I think it'd
be fun to, like,

19:55.281 --> 19:58.153
go off and do
something together,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.894
like a cute date.
- Okay.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.809
- Will you go on
a cute date with me?

20:13.124 --> 20:15.301
- Did you have fun?
- What, tonight in general?

20:15.344 --> 20:17.128
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.261
- yeah.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.654
Come on.

20:20.697 --> 20:21.785
- Dude, we're going
snowboarding in the morning,

20:21.829 --> 20:22.960
like, early.
- What time?

20:23.004 --> 20:25.354
- I think we have
to be up at, like, 8:00,

20:25.398 --> 20:26.921
because we're headed
to the mountain.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.924
- Am I in, like,
a loony bin?

20:41.109 --> 20:43.633
- You gotta get outta
here before I go crazy.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.202
Good night, guys.
- Good night, sweeties.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.334
Good night!

20:48.377 --> 20:49.857
- We'll see you
guys in the morning.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.033
- Please close our door.
- Yeah, close our door.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.774
Be respectful.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.604
- You are like...

21:08.092 --> 21:11.922
- Now, spit.
Oh, did you just swallow?

21:22.498 --> 21:25.632
- I love you, Kyle.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.287
- We're going
skiing all day.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.245
- Thank you for that.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.552
Appreciate it.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.249
- Muah.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.479
- Sick, more
half drank water bottles.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.872
Surprise.
- I know.

21:48.916 --> 21:49.830
I just started
drinking out of a cup.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.353
- Do you have
a paper towel?

21:51.397 --> 21:52.659
- Yeah, there's
not much left.

21:52.702 --> 21:53.442
- I know.
I just need one.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.009
Thank you.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.317
Aye-aye-aye.
Are you getting ready?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.970
- I, like, cannot
figure out

22:00.014 --> 22:02.756
how to get the bags out
from under my eyes.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.498
- It's, like,
awkward upstairs

22:05.541 --> 22:07.064
because Gabby is not
even talking to me.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.066
She's, like, not
even looking at me.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.067
- What?

22:10.111 --> 22:11.417
I think you should
talk to her.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.853
I think-I think you'll
feel better,

22:12.896 --> 22:13.941
honestly, if you
just, like, know

22:13.984 --> 22:16.030
what the
is going on.

22:20.861 --> 22:23.429
- I can't eat it anymore.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.126
- Well, hello, buddy.
- Hey, man.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.608
- Here we go!

22:28.651 --> 22:29.565
- I'm ready.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.785
- Yeah, buddy, the party car.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.135
- All right, let's get
this show on the road.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.402
- All right,
so, are we ready

22:40.446 --> 22:41.838
to, like, take on
the slopes today

22:41.882 --> 22:43.231
or what?
- I'm excited to ski

22:43.274 --> 22:45.102
with Amanda 'cause
it's been a while.

22:45.146 --> 22:46.147
- Is she good?

22:46.190 --> 22:48.367
- Um, she kinda
gets in her head.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.413
The very first time we ski,
I brought her to the top.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.720
I'm like, "You can do it."

22:53.763 --> 22:55.896
That first run
took an hour.

22:55.939 --> 22:59.247
Like, the poor girl, like,
crying behind her goggles.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.119
It's been a little hard
gettin' her

23:02.163 --> 23:03.294
back on the slope
ever since.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.085
All right, everybody.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.391
- We're doin' it.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.653
- Let's have some fun, guys.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.350
- Whoo!

23:17.613 --> 23:19.267
- All right.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.619
- Unless you're going
down the bunny hill,

23:23.663 --> 23:24.838
we probably won't see ya.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.583
- Three miles?

23:30.626 --> 23:32.280
- How do you put this on?

23:32.323 --> 23:33.368
- Here, I'll do it.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.674
- Help me.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.633
- Oh, my God, this is
a cute teaching moment.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.026
- That's what we need.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.639
- Oh, I'll try.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.249
- So this is my fiance.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.469
- Awesome.
- I'm gonna leave her with you.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.731
- You're gonna
do great today.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.167
- So, you guys take
good care of her.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.082
- Will do.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.736
- Bye, Cookie.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.216
- Guys, I just
wanna ----in' rip.

23:55.259 --> 23:58.262
- All right,
let's Whoo!

23:58.306 --> 24:00.177
- I'm gonna let go,
and you're gonna go straight.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.223
- No! No!

24:02.266 --> 24:03.790
Stop me.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.748
Oh, hell no.
I can't do that.

24:05.792 --> 24:08.621
- Oh, sh--!

24:08.664 --> 24:10.231
There she goes, again.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.493
- Ahh!

24:22.373 --> 24:23.810
- Let's go, Lindsay!

24:23.853 --> 24:25.986
Oh, sorry.
- Oh, God.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.640
- This is the highest
peak in Vermont.

24:27.683 --> 24:28.815
- Love it.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.209
- Andy, what is up, man?

24:32.253 --> 24:33.776
- Were you a stallion
last night,

24:33.820 --> 24:34.908
the Italian stallion?

24:34.951 --> 24:36.649
- No, I didn't do
any stallion moves.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.085
- Oh, you did a move, pal.

24:38.128 --> 24:41.044
Oh, my God.
Did he just choke her?

24:41.088 --> 24:42.524
- She told me
she really liked it.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.612
- She got a little
hot and heavy,

24:43.656 --> 24:44.831
and she was like,
"You gotta go."

24:44.874 --> 24:46.310
- I think Paige
is a good girl.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.921
- No, she is.
I like her personality.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.270
I like her a lot,

24:49.313 --> 24:51.751
but, uh, I just don't
wanna, like, rush things.

24:51.794 --> 24:52.882
I broke up with
my ex-girlfriend

24:52.926 --> 24:54.928
nine months ago
because of COVID.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.800
I got stuck in Italy,
and she was in the U.S.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.889
It was tough because
I envisioned myself

24:59.933 --> 25:01.282
spending the rest
of my life with her.

25:01.325 --> 25:05.068
I kinda like being by myself
and be a single guy.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.896
I don't want
a rebound relationship.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.464
I just want something
casual for now,

25:09.508 --> 25:13.033
and I'm glad that Paige and I
are just taking it easy.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.904
- Just havin' fun
on vacation.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.036
- Yeah, I don't know
if I'm ready for

25:16.079 --> 25:17.341
anything bigger than
that, you know?

25:17.385 --> 25:18.778
- Your ten other girlfriends
wouldn't like it.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.781
- Coming up...

25:23.913 --> 25:25.349
- Oh, my God, we're
both in animal print.

25:25.393 --> 25:26.742
We didn't even know it.
- Oh, my God.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.396
- I love that for y'all.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.233
- That's a good ----in' fire.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.104
- Hey, welcome
to the bottom.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.585
- We brought more
blankets and booze,

25:43.629 --> 25:45.065
which are equally important.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.980
- Today was chilly up top,
though, guys.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.938
- Dude, quit your whining.
Go live in Charleston.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.638
- Human contact.
- Come here.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.683
- I'm just gonna stay here.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.424
- Hi, baby.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.034
- Wait, can I get
the full download

25:58.078 --> 25:59.166
from the bunny slope?

25:59.209 --> 26:00.733
- Amanda did amazing.

26:00.776 --> 26:01.777
- I was better
than all the kids.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.605
- Yes.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.912
- I'm getting full smoke.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.914
- Pun intended.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.960
- Gab, do you
wanna go talk?

26:13.833 --> 26:16.139
- I gotta say food
makes me happy.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.750
It makes me warmer, too.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.534
- Food makes me
pretty happy, too.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.492
- Who needs a woman
when you have pizza?

26:23.016 --> 26:24.278
- Ciara, last night,
came to me

26:24.321 --> 26:26.323
and all of a sudden,
she was like,

26:26.367 --> 26:28.456
"Gabby is pissed at you 'cause
you were dancing with Luke."

26:28.499 --> 26:30.676
I didn't really see why.
- It wasn't-it wasn't just that.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.286
You were like,
"Do you want me to talk to him?

26:32.329 --> 26:33.766
"Do you want me
to talk to him?"

26:33.809 --> 26:36.029
All of a sudden, you-you were,
like, grinding on him.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.552
- I thought maybe
I would save it

26:37.596 --> 26:39.119
for when he's, like,
building the igloo

26:39.162 --> 26:40.207
or something
a little more intimate

26:40.250 --> 26:41.512
to have a real
conversation.

26:41.556 --> 26:42.949
- I get that, but that's not--
it's-- it's--

26:42.992 --> 26:43.950
- I'm not gonna pull him aside
when I'm ----ed up.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.168
- That part is
not it, though.

26:45.212 --> 26:45.778
So, you just turned--
- You're mad at me

26:45.821 --> 26:47.257
for dancing with a guy.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.868
I-I have a boyfriend.
- No, you're allowed to do that.

26:48.911 --> 26:49.956
I don't think you
understand it, though.
- I'm not, like--

26:49.999 --> 26:51.131
I don't understand.
I'm trying to.

26:51.174 --> 26:52.393
- Let the tables turn,
is what I'm trying to say.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.003
- I'm not trying to be
a bitch about it.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.614
Like, obviously, I care
about our friendship,

26:55.657 --> 26:59.139
but, like, I just don't
see it the way you see it.

26:59.182 --> 27:01.054
- Julia can never be wrong.

27:01.097 --> 27:03.491
Julia has an ego.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.885
Julia will never, ever see
someone else's perspective.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.277
I'm telling you how I felt.
- Okay.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.149
- I'm expressing
that you hurt me.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.541
- You were-- you're
not expressing.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.847
- I did, I expressed to you.
- You actually went

27:11.891 --> 27:12.848
and told somebody else
how you were feeling,

27:12.892 --> 27:14.154
and they came to me.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.678
- Do not turn that sh--.
Do not do that.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.071
- Okay, all right.

27:18.114 --> 27:20.551
Well, then nothing is
getting accomplished.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.163
- What's the temperature
up there?

27:23.206 --> 27:24.120
- Thirteen, fourteen.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.209
- Dude, my butt is cold.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.341
- You need a blanket.

27:27.384 --> 27:28.908
- Yeah, you guys
have them all.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.953
- Oh, we do.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.215
- You're like, wow, you--
- She's like,

27:32.259 --> 27:33.782
"My hands are sweating."
- A blanket, Amanda.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.439
- All right, let's go home
where it's warm.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.006
- You know when your ears
are so cold,

27:40.049 --> 27:41.398
your head starts to hurt?

27:41.442 --> 27:42.661
It's weird.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.056
- What's up?
- Hi.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.145
- Second wind
they say, eh?

27:49.189 --> 27:51.626
- No more wind-- I can't
handle any more wind.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.371
- Whoo!
Wakin' back up.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.285
- All right, we're gettin'
in the hot tub

27:58.328 --> 28:00.026
'cause I can't feel
my body.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.418
Craig!
- I'm coming.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.159
Hold on.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.380
- Like, a spaghetti
with meat sauce.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.600
- Look at these
little ----ers.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.341
If I go on my cameras
on my lake property, right now,

28:11.385 --> 28:13.648
it's live, right?
So, look at this owl.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.738
- What?
- Aww.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.653
- Wait, I love animals.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.786
- I get four deer every night,
and then two more come,

28:20.829 --> 28:21.961
and then I've got
a pet rabbit

28:22.004 --> 28:24.050
that's there every day.
- Aww.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.225
- As I've gotten
to know Julia more,

28:25.268 --> 28:26.879
it's like she's fun,
she's outgoing,

28:26.922 --> 28:28.141
and I'm attracted
to that.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.751
- Definitely needs
more spices in it.

28:29.795 --> 28:30.970
- You want spice?

28:31.013 --> 28:32.972
Maybe cayenne
or do you want some thyme?

28:33.015 --> 28:34.016
- Oh, is there
thyme in there?

28:34.060 --> 28:35.278
- Yeah.

28:35.322 --> 28:36.976
- But she has a boyfriend,
so her.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.629
I'm just kidding.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.328
- Some, like,
parmesan Reggiano.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.764
- Yeah, I mean, if you
wanna get that out.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.331
There's a little
basil there.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.594
- Julia, this
is phenomenal.

28:46.637 --> 28:47.900
- Thanks.
- Wow.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.162
- Yeah, that's why
I roll with her, you know.

28:49.205 --> 28:50.859
- Jason actually is
a good cook, too.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.644
- Wait, where is Gabby?

28:54.820 --> 28:56.560
- The pasta is perfect.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.478
- Yes.
- Yeah.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.089
- When I first moved here,
I was really scared

29:03.132 --> 29:04.699
of you and Craig.
- Yeah.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.614
- Usually, I don't really
get along with too many guys.

29:06.657 --> 29:07.615
- Why not?
- I don't understand.

29:07.658 --> 29:08.529
I don't know.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.011
- I heard you guys needed
hot chicks down here.

29:12.054 --> 29:13.229
- Yeah!

29:14.970 --> 29:16.972
- Hello.
- Hi, moms.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.931
- Hey.
So, what's up?

29:18.974 --> 29:21.716
- So, like, me and Julia
got into it.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.110
- You just made a meal
for everyone to eat,

29:24.153 --> 29:25.459
and I will clean up.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.461
- It kinda broke my heart
'cause I'm like

29:27.504 --> 29:29.419
you can't see
where I'm coming from.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.726
When I do speak up for
myself, it's like,

29:31.770 --> 29:33.206
with Julia, sometimes
I just feel like

29:33.249 --> 29:34.685
I'm invalidated, you know?

29:34.729 --> 29:36.122
- You can't control
another person,

29:36.165 --> 29:36.992
so you just gotta know
where it's at.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.341
- I know.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.301
- Oh, my God, we're both
wearing animal print.

29:41.344 --> 29:42.606
- Oh, my God!
- We didn't know it.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.347
- Oh, my God,
I love that for y'all.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.829
- I thought this was
supposed to be

29:47.873 --> 29:50.963
a fun, flirty two-week
vacation in the snow

29:51.006 --> 29:52.703
with my best friend, Austen,

29:52.747 --> 29:55.358
but he's interested
in someone else.

29:55.402 --> 29:58.318
I feel alone,
and it ----ing sucks.

29:58.361 --> 30:01.843
I've made so many
bad decisions with men.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.802
All you wanna do right now,
is just have fun

30:03.845 --> 30:05.020
with or without me.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.152
- I don't know
what to tell you.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.501
- Say hi to

30:08.894 --> 30:10.721
- Because that's what
we do in the Hamptons.

30:11.897 --> 30:12.941
- Oh, really?

30:12.985 --> 30:14.334
- Life is good.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.118
We're not dating.
We're just having fun.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.337
We're friends.
- Oh, we're not dating.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.425
- No, we're not.

30:18.468 --> 30:19.861
- Are you not happy?

30:19.905 --> 30:21.820
- Your version of good,
is not good enough for me.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.343
- So ----ing annoying.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.779
I'm just gonna
leave the house.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.346
- Maybe I should go
for the nice guy.

30:26.389 --> 30:27.826
Maybe do something
different.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.664
- You don't have to.
- Oh, oh.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.063
- Do I want to sleep
with Andrea

30:48.107 --> 30:49.238
right in this moment?

30:49.282 --> 30:51.066
Absolutely.
I am a human.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.547
But guys are simple
creatures, okay?

30:53.590 --> 30:56.202
They want one thing,
and when you give it to them,

30:56.245 --> 30:57.551
they lose interest.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.902
- Yeah.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.121
- I really like him.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.558
I definitely made
scenarios up in my head

31:04.601 --> 31:08.040
in which we're dating,
going out to dinner, fun.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.303
What are we waiting for?

31:11.739 --> 31:13.480
- We'll all go.
- Guys, we're all goin'.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.005
- Eww.

31:19.616 --> 31:23.707
- Uh...

31:23.751 --> 31:25.361
- My dick.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.799
- All right, guys.
Today was fun.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.105
- See you tomorrow!

31:30.149 --> 31:31.802
- Oh, my God,
I gotta go to bed.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.337
-
I went right to bed.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.426
- Maybe there is
something we can do, like,

31:46.469 --> 31:48.036
out of the house.
Is there-- can we, like,

31:48.080 --> 31:51.126
go and eat cheese somewhere?
- Why? You wanna date?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.606
- Just get, like,
----ed up on cheese.

31:52.649 --> 31:53.737
- Aww.

32:01.615 --> 32:02.964
- Did you just work out?

32:03.008 --> 32:04.313
- No, I'm about to,

32:04.357 --> 32:06.359
but, uh, I was
thinkin' we, uh,

32:06.402 --> 32:09.449
do a little double date,
if you're, uh,

32:09.492 --> 32:11.712
so inclined, very casual.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.714
- Okay, what do you have
in mind, by the way?

32:13.757 --> 32:15.150
- Wine tasting.
- Oh, okay.

32:16.412 --> 32:17.936
- What? The coffee?

32:24.507 --> 32:25.987
- Hello.
- Who is it?

32:30.339 --> 32:31.993
- Hello.
- Hello, Ciara.

32:33.473 --> 32:36.215
I think it'd be fun
to, like, go off

32:36.258 --> 32:38.217
and-and do something.
- Okay.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.567
- Will you go on
a cute date with me?

32:40.610 --> 32:42.482
- Duh.
Of ----ing course.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.484
- Great.
Kyle had mentioned to me

32:44.527 --> 32:46.399
that-that him and Amanda
wanted to, like,

32:46.442 --> 32:47.574
go on some wine tasting.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.315
- Okay, so, when
do we leave?

32:49.358 --> 32:50.577
- Probably sooner
than later.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.492
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.015
- Thanks.
- See ya soon.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.974
- I'm excited.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.192
I am so ----in' nervous.

32:57.236 --> 32:58.977
I actually like this kid,

32:59.020 --> 33:01.849
but I've let my guard down
in the past before

33:01.892 --> 33:03.285
a little too soon,

33:03.329 --> 33:05.722
and I feel like I've always
gotten bit in the ass,

33:05.766 --> 33:10.118
but, like, I really,
really like him.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.946
Mmm.

33:13.861 --> 33:14.818
- Coming up...

33:14.862 --> 33:16.559
- You're turning
30 this summer.

33:16.603 --> 33:17.865
- Yeah.
- Really?

33:17.908 --> 33:19.040
- Gotta start shoppin'
for a new 20-year-old.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.043
- Kyle, I--
I will kick your ass.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.827
- How romantic.

33:29.790 --> 33:30.921
- And we have to figure
out what I'm gonna wear.

33:30.965 --> 33:33.228
- I feel like we're
on Love Island.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.187
- I want something tight.

33:35.230 --> 33:39.713
- I'm thinking, like,
chic Aspen snow vibe,

33:39.756 --> 33:43.021
so, like, a leather pant.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.198
- Craig.
- What?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.114
- Love this.
We're gonna go with this.

33:49.157 --> 33:51.159
- You should wear this
to your date.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.031
- Well, I'm puttin', like,
a flannel on over it.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.032
That's it.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.511
- You look like
a lumberjack.

33:55.555 --> 33:58.427
- I've only officially
been single for three months,

33:58.471 --> 34:00.821
and so I have not
been on a proper date

34:00.864 --> 34:03.171
with another woman
in three years.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.346
I'm nervous.

34:04.390 --> 34:05.695
So, I'm like
don't overthink.

34:05.739 --> 34:08.089
- It's gonna be fun.
- Dude, my hair!

34:08.133 --> 34:10.135
I hate that I got in
the hot tub last night.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.745
- How are you feeling
just, like, in general,

34:11.788 --> 34:13.312
that it's gonna be
your first date?

34:13.355 --> 34:15.270
- I'm, like, freaking out.

34:15.314 --> 34:18.969
- Wait, I'm so excited.
Ahh!

34:19.013 --> 34:22.669
The fact that my friend
is going on a date is amazing,

34:22.712 --> 34:23.713
and she deserves it.

34:23.757 --> 34:24.932
Okay, how are you
doing your hair?

34:24.975 --> 34:26.020
Curling it?

34:26.064 --> 34:26.890
- No, I'm straightening
this sh--.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.850
- On the other hand, hello.

34:29.893 --> 34:32.070
I would like to be
taken out on a date.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.420
So happy for you--
sad for myself.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.552
- All right, I'm gonna
go get my jacket.

34:36.596 --> 34:38.511
- Put on a timepiece.

34:38.554 --> 34:39.642
- Eee!

34:39.686 --> 34:41.209
- Just, like,
to take the edge off.

34:41.253 --> 34:42.689
- Are you nervous?

34:42.732 --> 34:45.083
- He clearly is.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.435
- Okay, guys, I didn't
take the casual approach,

34:49.478 --> 34:51.915
but it's okay.
- Oh!

34:51.959 --> 34:56.746
- Oh, goodness!
Girl, servin' the look.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.226
- This is unfair.
- Look at this.

34:58.270 --> 35:02.100
- See the difference?
Engaged and comfortable.

35:02.143 --> 35:05.103
Brings me back to those times
with Kyle when you, like,

35:05.146 --> 35:07.017
do your hair and,
like, get all ready.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.629
Now, I just
roll out of bed.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.892
You look amazing.
- You look amazing, too, Amanda.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.198
- He's like,
"Can you put mascara on?"

35:13.241 --> 35:14.677
I'm like, "I don't know.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.593
I don't feel like
washing my face tonight."

35:17.637 --> 35:18.986
- Okay.
- All right.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.335
- Bye, guys.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.728
- Have fun.
Bye, kids.

35:21.771 --> 35:24.252
- While the 'rents are away,
the kids will play.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.609
- Oh, yeah.

35:34.741 --> 35:37.570
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.050
- Hi. Um, are you going skiin'?
- Yeah.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.444
Yeah, um, we're--
we're supposed to go skiing.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.925
Yeah.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.579
- You--
- Like we're--

35:46.622 --> 35:48.711
- Wait, say it, again.

35:48.755 --> 35:52.672
The service isn't
great out here.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.413
Um, all right.

35:54.456 --> 35:59.853
Well, uh, I love you,
and I will see you, um,

35:59.896 --> 36:02.116
I'll see you soon.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.423
- See you soon.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.428
- Kyle, let's be cute.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.823
- I knew
they'd be a good team.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.521
All right, kiddos.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.479
- Oh, I can't
move my body.

36:17.523 --> 36:18.698
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

36:18.741 --> 36:19.873
- Welcome to Cork.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.222
I've got you joining us
right over here.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.484
- Thank you.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.094
- All right, perfect.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.444
- Oh, wait, wait.
No, I got it.

36:25.487 --> 36:26.619
Aww.

36:26.662 --> 36:27.663
- Are you just following
what Austen does?

36:27.707 --> 36:29.665
- Yeah, I'm with
a Southerner here.

36:29.709 --> 36:30.753
- Are you good?

36:30.797 --> 36:31.754
- I gotta go on
more double dates.

36:31.798 --> 36:34.061
Kyle takes cues
from other guys.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.280
- We're just
jumpin' into this.

36:35.323 --> 36:36.411
- Yeah, this is wonderful.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.979
- This is a Lambrusco.
Enjoy.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.328
I'll be back with
some cheese

36:40.372 --> 36:41.677
and some charcuterie.
- Thank you so much.

36:41.721 --> 36:42.765
- I love that.
Thank you.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.071
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.856
- Cheers to your guys'
first date.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.162
- First double date.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.382
- And our first double date
in a long time.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.211
Truth be told.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.213
Being around, like,
couples or people flirting--

36:55.256 --> 36:57.171
- You guys, this is, like,
so necessary.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.217
- You know, but it was,
like, aww, it's cute.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.392
- A shot of life.

37:00.435 --> 37:01.871
- They're, like,
excited about making out.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.570
I just don't
want us to-- yeah.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.049
- Well, no, it's-- I was--
- I feel like we have to

37:06.093 --> 37:07.877
make a little
bit of an effort.

37:07.921 --> 37:12.012
- Like, what's the sex life
like, Kyle?

37:12.055 --> 37:13.840
- You know, last year,
it's been challenging

37:13.883 --> 37:15.668
working together,
living together.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.236
- Do you feel like
more like a roommate?

37:21.326 --> 37:23.893
- No, but, I mean,
but I will say just seeing,

37:23.937 --> 37:25.982
like, sparks fly
among you guys,

37:26.026 --> 37:27.332
among Paige and Andrea,
I mean, it does kinda make me--

37:27.375 --> 37:28.724
- Can you stop?

37:28.768 --> 37:29.856
- Are you nervous?
- I'm like aww.

37:29.899 --> 37:31.161
It's-- it's adorable.

37:31.205 --> 37:32.859
It takes me back to five
and a half years ago.

37:32.902 --> 37:34.426
- I know.

37:34.469 --> 37:35.688
- Which is a long time ago.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.907
- Wait, what's your guys'
age difference?

37:37.951 --> 37:40.562
- I'm 25.
- I'm 33, eight years.

37:40.606 --> 37:41.911
- That's the sweet spot.
We're nine.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.173
- We're nine.
- Nine years?

37:43.217 --> 37:44.827
- Yeah, but you're
turning 30 this summer.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.133
- Yeah.
- Really?

37:46.176 --> 37:47.308
- Gotta start shoppin'
for a new 20-year-old.

37:48.962 --> 37:49.876
- Kyle, I--
I will kick your ass.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.225
- How romantic.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.271
- It was a joke.
- I will kick your ass.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.887
- I'm gonna make a sandwich.
Do you want one?

38:00.930 --> 38:02.236
- Yeah, I'll take one.
- Okay.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.717
- Where did Ciara go?
- She's on a date.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.545
- She is?
I'm so excited for her.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.069
- They're on
a double date.

38:09.112 --> 38:11.332
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.769
- Good for her.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.858
- I'm, like, I would
like to go on a date.

38:15.902 --> 38:17.382
You know, like...
- Yeah.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.863
It is so adorable
seeing Andrea like this.

38:20.907 --> 38:23.562
Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.346
- Um, 'cause
I've only known him

38:25.390 --> 38:27.566
to be sleeping around
with girls.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.442
- Oh, man, I'll do
an ab workout with you.

38:34.486 --> 38:35.356
How long is it?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.749
- Eight minutes.
- Let's rip.

38:36.792 --> 38:39.665
- Oh, sh--, not good.
- What?

38:39.708 --> 38:42.755
- I just got two texts
from two girls that I like.

38:42.798 --> 38:45.497
- Wait, you're talking to
two girls at the same time?

38:45.540 --> 38:46.628
That doesn't surprise me.

38:47.716 --> 38:49.370
That doesn't surprise me.

38:49.414 --> 38:50.589
- You don't wanna have
any romance,

38:50.632 --> 38:52.112
or, I mean, don't want to?

38:52.155 --> 38:53.374
Like, you don't
like anybody?

38:53.418 --> 38:55.071
- I came in here
without any expectations.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.421
- Yeah, of course.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.901
- So, I'm just like
whatever happens, happens.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.120
Then you have, like, Julia,
who, like,

39:00.163 --> 39:01.251
I feel like is a ton of fun.

39:01.295 --> 39:03.210
- Is she more your type?

39:03.253 --> 39:04.646
- Well, her personality
is just really fun.

39:04.690 --> 39:05.821
- No, I mean, I love her.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.345
- Do you know much
about her boyfriend?

39:07.388 --> 39:09.303
- I know there's been
a lot of on and off.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.566
- Oh, really?
- I know that for sure.

39:11.610 --> 39:15.048
Why don't you try to investigate
and know more?

39:15.091 --> 39:16.223
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:16.266 --> 39:19.618
I-- I think I--
I think I should.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.494
- What's the biggest
age difference?

39:26.538 --> 39:28.322
- That I've dated?
- That you've dated, yeah.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.716
- Like, 20, 19 years.
I was 23.

39:30.759 --> 39:31.717
- What'd your mom
think of that?

39:31.760 --> 39:32.805
- Mom didn't know.

39:32.848 --> 39:33.936
We're on a
need-to-know basis.

39:33.980 --> 39:34.546
- Oh!
- We're on a need-to-know basis.

39:34.589 --> 39:35.982
- Yeah.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.331
Hey, oh, my God, that's
what I said to my parents.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.811
They're like, "So?"
- We're on a need to know.

39:38.854 --> 39:39.594
- So, I'm like, "Dad,
you're on a need-to-know basis."

39:39.638 --> 39:40.726
- Yeah.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.162
- When I showed my mom
pictures of Kyle

39:42.205 --> 39:43.642
for the first time, she's like,
"Does he have, like,

39:43.685 --> 39:45.557
Peter Pan syndrome?"
- I was like, "Yeah."

39:45.600 --> 39:46.993
- Peter Pan syndrome is,
like, a big--

39:47.036 --> 39:49.169
a big thing in Charleston.
- And New York City.

39:49.212 --> 39:50.997
- In-in the South,
things are different, right?

39:51.040 --> 39:52.172
- Oh, my God,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:52.215 --> 39:53.608
My mom raised me
as a single mom.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.523
So, she's like,
"When it happens, it'll happen,

39:55.567 --> 39:57.046
but you need to have
your career."

39:57.090 --> 39:58.483
- In the South,
there's always, like, a joke.

39:58.526 --> 40:01.050
Women go to college
to get their, you know, M-R-S.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.182
- M.R.S., yeah.
- They-they go to college

40:02.225 --> 40:04.010
to find a man to marry.
- Yeah.

40:04.053 --> 40:06.012
- So, her focusing on
career is, like,

40:06.055 --> 40:08.188
the hottest possible thing
you can ever say.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.103
- That's-- that's hot.
- Whew.

40:11.365 --> 40:12.671
- Where do you
see yourself in two years?

40:12.714 --> 40:14.368
- I mean-- I mean, kids?
- I definitely want kids.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.543
I definitely want three.
- Okay.

40:15.587 --> 40:16.501
- Like, I want to have two,
adopt one.

40:16.544 --> 40:17.806
- Oh, she knows
the number.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.155
She wants to have kids stat,
which is, like...

40:19.199 --> 40:20.722
- Not stat.
- Let's get a dog.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.420
- I would just like to,
like, get off birth control.

40:22.463 --> 40:23.638
- Urgent.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.510
- And, like, let nature
takes its course.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.163
- That means you're gonna
get pregnant very soon.

40:27.207 --> 40:28.164
- Maybe not.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.606
- Um, well, guys,
I'm so glad we took you out

40:34.649 --> 40:35.781
on your first date.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.086
- I'm a big numbers guy.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.001
Scale from one to ten,
how is the first date?

40:39.045 --> 40:40.916
- Like, an 11.
- A 12.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.091
- Aww.
- Oh, he said, "12."

40:42.135 --> 40:42.831
- Aww.
- I did.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.180
- Good.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.486
We want them to like me
more than I like them.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.664
- When I came to this house,
I just wanted to have fun

40:49.708 --> 40:50.796
because, once again,

40:50.839 --> 40:51.753
I had just gotten out
of somethin',

40:51.797 --> 40:52.885
so I'm like no.
No, no, no.

40:52.928 --> 40:54.408
I can't.
I can't do this.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.671
Lo and behold, I--
I, like, found someone

40:56.715 --> 40:59.152
who is really cool and
really great.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.370
- I thought you guys might
have almost just kissed.

41:00.414 --> 41:02.242
- Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.331
- Aww.
- Aww.

41:04.374 --> 41:06.333
- Ciaras do not grow on trees,

41:06.376 --> 41:10.859
but I don't know that
I'm ready to move on.

41:18.867 --> 41:19.825
- Yeah.
- How much do I weigh?

41:21.174 --> 41:22.349
- Can you put
me on your back?

41:24.003 --> 41:25.657
- Sure, sure.
Where are we going?

41:27.485 --> 41:28.790
- Is this, like,
a normal workout for you?

41:28.834 --> 41:29.965
- Yeah.

41:30.009 --> 41:31.750
- Do you think someone
is saving this?

41:31.793 --> 41:33.926
- I don't think so.
If you want it, eat it.

41:33.969 --> 41:34.970
- Do you want it?

41:35.014 --> 41:38.278
- No, I don't.
Thanks for asking.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.106
- Hopefully, I don't
blow anything up.

41:40.149 --> 41:41.281
- Doesn't this
hurt your neck?

41:41.324 --> 41:42.587
- No.
My neck, no.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.284
Actually, it's better
than going to the gym.

41:44.327 --> 41:46.286
It's better than the bar.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.636
You're softer
in a good way.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.508
- For some reason, I feel like
I'm working out, too,

41:50.551 --> 41:53.902
and, like, I just didn't
sign up for that today.

41:53.946 --> 41:55.034
We get it.

41:55.077 --> 41:56.775
We know that you
absolutely can squat.

41:56.818 --> 41:58.994
We've seen your abs.

41:59.038 --> 42:01.475
Honestly, I like
a dad bod anyway. So...

42:01.519 --> 42:02.824
How many times are
you gonna do it?

42:02.868 --> 42:04.130
- We're gonna
do five sets.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.219
- Five sets?
- Of 12.

42:06.262 --> 42:08.047
- My two best friends
are on a double date,

42:08.090 --> 42:09.831
and what are you
asking me to do?

42:09.875 --> 42:11.180
Bench press?

42:11.224 --> 42:12.355
- We have three more,
and we're done.

42:12.399 --> 42:15.576
- No, I'm done.
Get me out of here.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.578
- Next time,
on "Winter House"...

42:20.189 --> 42:21.887
- This is dedicated to Luke.

42:24.585 --> 42:26.108
What I said was,
"I want you inside me."

42:26.152 --> 42:28.328
- Oh, wow, buddy!

42:28.371 --> 42:31.461
- It's so ----ing hard
to be 28, and, like,

42:31.505 --> 42:34.464
you have, like, no one
you think you're gonna marry.

42:42.211 --> 42:44.474
- Ahh!

42:47.390 --> 42:49.523
- You're asking me out
on a date in Vermont.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.916
- Yeah.

42:50.959 --> 42:52.439
- You know, if you can't
see a future with someone,

42:52.482 --> 42:54.572
I don't know if going on a date
is the best thing to do.

42:54.615 --> 42:56.530
- It's the most romantic thing
I've ever done.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.619
- Like, I have to now tell
my friend and, like--

42:58.663 --> 43:00.099
- You-- you, yeah,
you have to.

43:00.142 --> 43:01.666
- That he's going around
telling people he's not into it.

43:01.709 --> 43:05.321
- You have to.
