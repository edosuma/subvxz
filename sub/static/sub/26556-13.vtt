00:01.044 --> 00:03.003
MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.

00:03.046 --> 00:04.482
AFTER 6 MONTHS IN HELL,

00:04.526 --> 00:06.310
I HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON
AND RETURNED HOME

00:06.354 --> 00:07.442
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL--

00:07.485 --> 00:08.965
TO SAVE MY CITY,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.314
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.186
INSTEAD OF OPERATING
OUTSIDE THE LAW,

00:12.229 --> 00:14.579
I AM NOW WORKING
ALONGSIDE THE POLICE.

00:14.623 --> 00:17.060
I AM NO LONGER INMATE 4587.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.714
I AM ONCE MORE...

00:18.757 --> 00:20.846
THE GREEN ARROW.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.326
PREVIOUSLY ON "ARROW"...

00:22.370 --> 00:24.154
THERE'’S ALWAYS GONNA
BE ANOTHER DANTE.

00:24.198 --> 00:26.243
THERE'’S ALWAYS GONNA
BE A LOGICAL REASON
TO COMPROMISE,

00:26.287 --> 00:27.940
BUT I'’M NOT DOING
THAT ANYMORE.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.856
-WALKING WAY IS NOT THE ANSWER.
-WELL, I'’M NOT WALKING AWAY.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.249
I'’M GONNA CALL
MY OWN SHOTS.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.295
I WENT TO GO CHECK
YOUR MIDTERM RESULTS ONLINE,

00:34.338 --> 00:36.645
AND I DIDN'’T COME ACROSS
ANY TEST RESULTS BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'’T TAKE THE EXAMS.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.560
-WHY?
-BECAUSE I GOT EXPELLED.

00:38.603 --> 00:41.171
CONNOR: SO YOU FOUND
THIS PLACE BY WATCHING
THAT DOCUMENTARY?

00:41.215 --> 00:43.434
BLACKSTAR: VIGILANTES WERE
THE DEATH OF STAR CITY,

00:43.478 --> 00:46.089
AND THEY GOT EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DESERVED.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.699
WE NOW HAVE
UNFETTERED ACCESS

00:47.743 --> 00:50.093
TO THE ARCHER PROGRAM'’S
ENTIRE SECURITY INTERFACE.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.573
LET'’S FIND THOSE BOMBS.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.406
[BEEP BEEP]

01:27.609 --> 01:29.567
-HEADING HOME SOON?
-NOT QUITE YET.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.091
I'’LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.713
WHAT'’S IT SAY?

02:28.757 --> 02:30.324
NOTHING.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.413
JUST SOME PUNK KID
PULLING A PRANK.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.220
FELICITY: YOU EVER GET IN
TROUBLE WITH YOUR PARENTS?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.396
UH, YEAH.
ALL THE TIME. WHY?

02:59.440 --> 03:01.920
BECAUSE WILLIAM DOESN'’T
NEED PANCAKES.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.749
WILLIAM NEEDS TO TELL US
WHY HE GOT EXPELLED

03:04.793 --> 03:06.664
AND WHY HE'’S BEEN
LYING TO US.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.753
-AFTER PANCAKES OR--
-NO.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.015
OK.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.284
-READY TO TALK?
-ABOUT WHAT?

03:17.327 --> 03:18.720
WHY YOU GOT
EXPELLED.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.591
COME ON, WILL.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK

03:20.635 --> 03:22.724
TO US ABOUT
ANYTHING. PLEASE.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.727
IT'’S NOT A BIG DEAL.
I JUST GOT INTO A FIGHT.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.076
I THOUGHT YOU'’D BE
PROUD OF ME.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.817
I WENT FOR THE NOSE
JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.601
WHEN DID YOU TELL HIM
TO GO FOR THE NOSE?

03:30.645 --> 03:32.299
THAT WAS OVER
A YEAR AGO,

03:32.342 --> 03:34.910
AND IT WAS A LESSON
IN SELF-DEFENSE,
THANK YOU.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.738
BUDDY, IT'’S NOT LIKE
YOU TO GET INTO A FIGHT.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.218
WHY DO YOU GUYS
EVEN CARE?

03:38.261 --> 03:39.784
EVERY TIME THAT
WE SPOKE, YOU'’RE
TELLING ME

03:39.828 --> 03:41.438
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
YOUR SCHOOL,

03:41.482 --> 03:43.092
ABOUT YOUR NEW FRIENDS
AND YOUR CLASSES.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.398
WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?

03:44.441 --> 03:46.269
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED HOW I FELT FOR ONCE,

03:46.313 --> 03:48.402
BUT YOU DON'’T ASK
OTHER PEOPLE FOR
THEIR OPINIONS.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.055
YOU DECIDE EVERYTHING
ON YOUR OWN

03:50.099 --> 03:51.666
JUST LIKE YOU DECIDED
TO GO TO PRISON

03:51.709 --> 03:53.755
RATHER THAN TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY!

03:53.798 --> 03:56.540
I DON'’T THINK
THAT'’S FAIR, BUT OK.

03:56.584 --> 03:59.413
WILLIAM, YOU GOT
EXPELLED,

03:59.456 --> 04:01.763
AND, YOUNG MAN, YOU
NEED TO UNDERSTAND

04:01.806 --> 04:05.332
THAT IN LIFE YOU
HAVE TO ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY

04:05.375 --> 04:06.594
FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.639
YEAH? I'’M OVER THIS.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.643
W-WILLIAM. HEY.

04:12.687 --> 04:15.559
WILLIAM, WE'’RE NOT
DONE HERE.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.257
[SIGHS]

04:17.300 --> 04:18.736
THAT WENT WELL.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.609
DAMN IT! STILL NO LUCK
FIGURING OUT

04:21.652 --> 04:23.306
WHERE FELICITY PLANTED
THOSE BOMBS.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.308
WELL, I'’M PRETTY SURE
HITTING THAT THING HARDER'’S

04:25.352 --> 04:27.049
NOT GONNA MAKE IT
WORK BETTER.

04:27.092 --> 04:29.051
MAKES ME FEEL
BETTER, THOUGH.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.053
THE ARCHER PROGRAM'’S
SUPPOSED TO SEE
EVERYTHING,

04:31.096 --> 04:33.185
BUT WHAT GOOD'’S THAT
WHEN THERE'’S NOTHING
TO SEE?

04:33.229 --> 04:36.188
[FOOTSTEPS]

04:36.232 --> 04:37.625
ABOUT DAMN TIME.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.540
YOUR ALGORITHM
KIND OF SUCKS.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.717
AH. NICE TO
SEE YOU, TOO.
GIVE IT TO ME.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.240
ARCHER'’S NOT HELPING US,
AND THAT MEANS

04:44.284 --> 04:47.156
BLACKSTAR'’S OUR ONLY LEAD
ON FINDING THOSE BOMBS.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.071
YOU GUYS HAVE ANY LUCK
TRACKING HER DOWN?

04:49.114 --> 04:51.334
UH-UH. I SPENT THE LAST
FEW DAYS SEARCHING
THE ENTIRE CITY,

04:51.378 --> 04:52.944
BUT SHE KNOWS
HOW TO BE A GHOST.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.077
PRETTY EASY TO DO
WITH THE WAY
THE CITY IS NOW.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.122
OK. MY ALGORITHM
ISN'’T THE PROBLEM.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.647
THE ARCHER PROGRAM
WAS DESIGNED TO
MONITOR THE GLADES,

04:59.690 --> 05:01.344
BUT STAR CITY IS
10 TIMES THE SIZE

05:01.388 --> 05:03.085
WITH HALF
THE TECHNOLOGICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.434
SO LESS EYES COVERING
A LARGER AREA.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.827
EVEN IF THAT'’S
THE CASE,

05:05.870 --> 05:07.481
THAT BOMB PLAN
WAS MASSIVE.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.178
WE SHOULD HAVE
FOUND SOMETHING.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.832
WELL, NOT
IF THE BOMBS HAVEN'’T
BEEN POSITIONED YET.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.703
I MEAN,
MAYBE FELICITY
STOCKPILED THEM

05:12.747 --> 05:14.139
SOMEWHERE
OFF THE GRID,

05:14.183 --> 05:15.837
SOMEWHERE NO ONE
WOULD EVER THINK
TO LOOK.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.056
I THINK
I MIGHT KNOW A PLACE.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.801
ZOE: THIS IS DEFINITELY
OFF THE GRID.

05:23.845 --> 05:28.806
WILLIAM: GOD. I USED
TO THINK THIS PLACE
WAS SO COOL.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.287
DINAH: I CAN'’T BELIEVE
IT'’S STILL STANDING.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.724
I CAN'’T BELIEVE
MY DAD USED TO
CALL THIS HOME.

05:33.768 --> 05:37.249
YEAH. WELL, NO ONE'’S
CALLED THIS HOME
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.208
SOMEONE'’S BEEN HERE.

05:39.251 --> 05:41.558
[DARTS WHOOSHING]

05:41.602 --> 05:42.907
UNH!

05:42.951 --> 05:44.344

STILL HERE.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.389
I TOLD YOU THIS
WOULDN'’T END WELL.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.877
WHAT'’S THAT, SOME
A.R.G.U.S. FAN MAIL?

05:55.920 --> 05:58.009
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

05:58.053 --> 06:02.187
OH. THIS IS SOME "I KNOW
WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"
CREEPINESS.

06:02.231 --> 06:05.060
-YOU WANT ME TO RUN A DNA TRACE?
-NO. ALREADY ON TOP OF THAT.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.932
BESIDES, THAT'’S NOT
THE REASON WHY I
CALLED YOU IN HERE.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.108
HOW'’S THE SEARCH
FOR DANTE COMING?

06:10.152 --> 06:12.241
GOOD. WE WERE ABLE TO
BACKTRACE THE NUMBER
DIAZ CALLED.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.591
IT BELONGS TO DANTE'’S
CONTACT IN EGYPT,
A GUY BY THE NAME OF VIRGIL.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.550
IF WE'’RE ABLE TO
BRING HIM IN,
WE'’LL HAVE DANTE.

06:16.593 --> 06:20.684
FANTASTIC! AND WE
WOULD HAVE YOU
TO THANK FOR IT.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.164
EXCELLENT WORK,
CURTIS.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.906
TOO BAD I MIGHT NOT BE
AROUND FOR MY VICTORY LAP.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.298
WHAT ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE?

06:26.342 --> 06:28.431
THERE'’S NO GOOD WAY
TO SAY THIS,

06:28.475 --> 06:32.130
BUT I'’VE BEEN OFFERED A JOB
AT THE KOHLER HUMANITARIAN
INSTITUTE IN D.C.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.958
I WOULD BE ABLE
TO CREATE TECH THAT
WOULD BE ABLE

06:34.002 --> 06:35.786
TO HELP PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

CURTIS, I KNOW YOU'’RE
NOT HAPPY WITH
THE GHOST INITIATIVE,

06:38.180 --> 06:40.138
BUT I WAS HOPING
THAT WE COULD GET
PAST THAT.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.879
BESIDES, THE WORK
YOU'’RE DOING RIGHT
HERE AT A.R.G.U.S.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.620
IS ALREADY HELPING
PEOPLE ALL OVER
THE WORLD.

06:43.664 --> 06:47.494
I KNOW YOU
BELIEVE THAT, JOHN.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.191
I'’M JUST NOT SURE
THAT I DO.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.158
THE KEY IS TO MAINTAIN
EYE CONTACT.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.117
YOUR ASSAILANT'’S GONNA
FOCUS ON YOUR WEAKNESS.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.988
IN THIS CASE,
IT'’S THAT INJURY.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.468
SO YOU DRAW THEM IN,

07:05.512 --> 07:09.167
AND AS SOON AS THEY'’RE
CLOSE ENOUGH, STRIKE.

07:09.211 --> 07:13.084
YEAH! THAT'’S VERY GOOD.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.825

OUT OF THAT SHIELD,

07:20.527 --> 07:23.660

HAVE TO DEPUTIZE YOU, TOO.

PRACTICING YOUR KICKS
IN YOUR ROOM?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.056
-OK.
-GOOD JOB.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.149

YOU LOOKED

07:34.192 --> 07:36.760
WHEN ZOE MENTIONED
THE BLACK CANARY.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.719
YOU STILL ADJUSTING
TO BEING OUTED?

07:38.762 --> 07:40.851
WELL, IT WAS ONE THING
WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE
IN OUR INNER CIRCLE

07:40.895 --> 07:42.505
KNEW ABOUT MY
SECRET IDENTITY,

AT THE SCPD FOR NOW

CRACK SOME HEADS.

BECAME CAPTAIN,

BECAUSE THEY'’RE GONNA HATE

-LAST NIGHT.

FOR WORKING WITH YOU
AND THE SCPD.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.723
-OH, DAMN.
-WHAT, DID YOU GET ONE, TOO?

08:26.767 --> 08:29.421
AND SO DID LAUREL.
WE'’VE BEEN TRYING TO
TRACK DOWN WHO DID IT.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.249
WE THOUGHT MAYBE
IT WAS ABOUT A CASE
WE WORKED TOGETHER,

08:31.293 --> 08:32.903
BUT IF YOU'’RE
GETTING THEM, TOO--

08:32.947 --> 08:34.949
WHO KNOWS WHO HIS
NEXT TARGET IS?

I CAN'’T MOVE.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.151
OH. STOP! PLEASE
JUST STOP.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.545
I'’LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

09:07.024 --> 09:10.332
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

09:10.375 --> 09:11.463
UGH!

09:18.209 --> 09:20.081
WOW! THIS IS
A LOT OF BLOOD.

09:20.124 --> 09:23.301
I THOUGHT KULLENS WAS
IN JAIL FOR HELPING DIAZ.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.347
JOHN: YEAH. WELL,
APPARENTLY, HE HAD
A VERY GOOD LAWYER

09:25.390 --> 09:27.523
BECAUSE HE GOT OUT
A MONTH AGO.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.525
ANY CHANCE THIS CONNECTS
WITH THE TWO BODY DROPS

WE WERE LOOKING AT
LAST WEEK?

09:32.310 --> 09:34.530
KULLENS DID HAVE HIS
THROAT SLIT, SAME
AS THE OTHER TWO.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.184
I MEAN, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
IS THAT KULLENS

09:36.227 --> 09:39.361
WAS THE ONLY VICTIM TO
LEAVE BEHIND ONE
OF THESE NOTES.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.710
LOOK FAMILIAR?

09:40.754 --> 09:42.451
I SPOKE TO THE FAMILIES
OF THE OTHER VICTIMS,

09:42.494 --> 09:43.931
AND THEY DID GET
NOTES, AS WELL.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.846
-THEY JUST DIDN'’T TURN THEM IN.
-RIGHT.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.022
THIS IS TURNING OUT
TO BE ONE HELL OF
A FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.328
YEAH. LOOK AT US,
WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN,

09:50.372 --> 09:52.069
BEING TARGETED
BY A HOMICIDAL MANIAC.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.549
FEELS LIKE A MONDAY.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.942
WHAT ABOUT LAUREL?

09:54.985 --> 09:57.031
YOU SAID THAT SHE
GOT A NOTE, TOO.

09:57.074 --> 09:59.033
SHE DID, BUT SHE'’S FINE.
SHE'’S AT A CONFERENCE
IN D.C. ALL WEEK.

09:59.076 --> 10:02.036
JOHN: OK. SO WAIT.
YOU, ME, LAUREL, RENE
ALL GOT NOTES.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.125
-CURTIS AND OLIVER DIDN'’T.
-OH, DON'’T WORRY ABOUT ME.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.518
I'’M DEFINITELY NOT
FEELING FOMO OVER IT.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.868
WELL, WE ALREADY KNOW
THIS KILLER'’S

10:07.911 --> 10:09.565
NOT ONLY TARGETING
PEOPLE ON THE TEAM.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.001
KULLENS WAS AGAINST
VIGILANTES,

10:11.045 --> 10:12.655
AND WE DIDN'’T EVEN KNOW
THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.091
THERE HAS TO BE
A CONNECTION.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.702
WE JUST...BE PATIENT,
AND WE'’LL FIND IT.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.529
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.096
KULLENS'’ AUTOPSY REPORT.

10:20.750 --> 10:24.493
TOX SCREEN IS CLEAR.
NO DEFENSIVE WOUNDS.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.408
SO HE DIDN'’T FIGHT BACK.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.410
THIS M.O. FEELS
VERY FAMILIAR.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.020
WHEN I WAS UNDERCOVER
IN CENTRAL CITY,

10:30.064 --> 10:31.892

WERE CHASING AFTER

ALMOST MAKES ME FORGET
THAT YOU'’RE NOTHING

11:01.573 --> 11:03.401
BUT A PAMPERED GIRL

ANOTHER WAY.

ALL RIGHT, WILLIAM.
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.901

TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

GONNA KILL US

JUST LIKE YOU KILLED FELICITY
AND JUST LIKE YOU'’RE GONNA
KILL THE REST OF THE CITY,

11:32.604 --> 11:34.389
SO WHAT IS THE POINT
IN TALKING?

11:34.432 --> 11:37.784

BLOW UP THE CITY,
BUT IT'’S NOT ME,

11:37.827 --> 11:40.525

DIDN'’T KILL FELICITY.

WITH DECREASED LEVELS
