<i>Catherine: It's gonna
be a hot place.</i>

01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:59.253
<i>Dan: It's in New Jersey.</i>

01:25:59.325 --> 01:26:00.451
It's gonna be
the hot new place.

01:26:00.526 --> 01:26:02.153
New Jersey's gonna be
the hot new place?

01:26:02.228 --> 01:26:03.992
The restaurant's gonna be
the hot new place.

01:26:04.063 --> 01:26:05.497
The restaurant's in New Jersey.

01:26:05.565 --> 01:26:06.691
Right across the river.

01:26:06.766 --> 01:26:07.699
Yeah,
but across the river...

01:26:07.767 --> 01:26:08.666
Just on the other side.

01:26:08.735 --> 01:26:10.464
-- Which makes <i>it</i> New Jersey.
-- Dan, you <i>gotta trust</i> me.

01:26:10.536 --> 01:26:11.799
Are other people
gonna be there?

01:26:11.871 --> 01:26:13.430
Of course other people
are gonna be there.

01:26:13.506 --> 01:26:15.167
-- I mean, other <i>people.</i>
-- Yeah.

01:26:15.241 --> 01:26:16.140
Who?

01:26:16.209 --> 01:26:17.199
Jay Mclnerney, Ivana Trump.

01:26:17.276 --> 01:26:18.437
Interestingly, the <i>other</i> girl

01:26:18.511 --> 01:26:20.343
who used to be married
to Donald Trump,

01:26:20.413 --> 01:26:21.539
-- whose name I can't...
-- Right.

01:26:21.614 --> 01:26:23.776
She, I grant you,
is not A-list.

01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:25.045
Trump's ex-wife?

01:26:25.118 --> 01:26:26.449
The one after Ivana
whose name I can't remember.

01:26:26.519 --> 01:26:28.817
I like her. I can't
remember her name, either,

01:26:28.888 --> 01:26:30.014
although I can tell you

01:26:30.089 --> 01:26:32.285
she was very good in
"Will Rogers Follies."

01:26:32.358 --> 01:26:33.450
What did she do?

01:26:33.526 --> 01:26:35.085
She sang, she danced,
I think she twirled a rope.

01:26:35.161 --> 01:26:36.629
All I know is,
I was finally happy

01:26:36.696 --> 01:26:38.460
to see her realize
her dream of the stage.

01:26:38.531 --> 01:26:39.623
<i>Kim: Five minutes to air.</i>

01:26:39.699 --> 01:26:40.928
<i>First team in the studio,
please.</i>

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.764
All I'm saying is that
the heat's died down on her

01:26:42.835 --> 01:26:44.428
a little since she's
not with Trump anymore.

01:26:44.504 --> 01:26:46.165
Yeah, and I think that's come
as a surprise to all of us.

01:26:46.239 --> 01:26:47.832
But it shouldn't stop you
from showing up tonight.

01:26:47.907 --> 01:26:48.874
I will.

01:26:48.941 --> 01:26:50.466
Just make an appearance,
get your picture taken...

01:26:50.543 --> 01:26:51.476
I just said I will.

01:26:51.544 --> 01:26:52.978
I will be in New Jersey
at midnight tonight.

01:26:53.045 --> 01:26:54.376
Should we have a car
take us?

01:26:54.447 --> 01:26:56.176
Not when we could just as easily
swim across the Hudson, no.

01:26:56.249 --> 01:26:58.013
-- You don't want to hire a car?
-- We'll take my car.

01:26:58.084 --> 01:26:59.711
-- We should hire a car.
-- I like to drive.

01:26:59.786 --> 01:27:01.914
There's gonna be press. People
will see you driving your own car.

01:27:01.988 --> 01:27:03.979
Oh, yeah, we wouldn't want it to get
out that I have a driver's license.

01:27:04.056 --> 01:27:05.581
-- We'll take your car.
-- Yes, we will.

01:27:05.658 --> 01:27:07.217
-- Right after the show?
-- Yes, already.

01:27:07.293 --> 01:27:09.091
I'm a very important part
of your life now, Dan.

01:27:09.162 --> 01:27:11.790
-- You can't take me for granted.
-- I don't take you for granted.

01:27:11.864 --> 01:27:14.492
<i>Elliot, this is my publicisfs
secretary, Catherine something.</i>

01:27:14.567 --> 01:27:17.264
-- Brenner, and I'm not a secretary.
-- Nice to meet you.

01:27:17.336 --> 01:27:20.101
-- She's in the 10th grade. -- I'm 22.
-- We're inside 5.

01:27:20.173 --> 01:27:22.039
-- You're not gonna flake out, right?
-- Leave me alone.

01:27:22.108 --> 01:27:23.269
-- Where's Dana?
-- Editing.

01:27:23.342 --> 01:27:24.901
-- Is she talking to me yet?
-- No.

01:27:24.977 --> 01:27:26.001
-- Danny?
" What?!

01:27:26.078 --> 01:27:27.671
Promise you're not
going to flake out.

01:27:27.747 --> 01:27:29.943
Just go into a room and watch
"Felicity," would you?

01:27:30.016 --> 01:27:32.212
Right. [Chuckles]
At 11:00 on a Thursday?

01:27:32.285 --> 01:27:34.117
Hey, I'm out of the
mainstream, Catherine.

01:27:34.187 --> 01:27:36.155
I better get myself
to New Jersey and stat.

01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:42.123
Dana, we've got Samaranch for three
minutes via satellite if we want it.

01:27:42.195 --> 01:27:44.129
It will come in the 20s,

01:27:44.197 --> 01:27:46.757
which is fine if you'll let me move Boston.
What do you think?

01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:48.733
-- I'm sorry, was somebody
speaking in here? -- Dana...

01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:50.565
-- <i>I thought I heard voices.</i>
-- <i>Dana...</i>

01:27:50.636 --> 01:27:51.831
Oh, must have been mistaken.

01:27:51.904 --> 01:27:54.066
-- Look...
-- "Saturday Night Live"?

01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.632
-- Do you want the damn satellite feed?
-- “Saturday Night Live“?

01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:58.370
Dana,
it's just an interview.

01:27:58.444 --> 01:27:59.809
-- It's a job interview.
-- That's right.

01:27:59.879 --> 01:28:00.937
-- Yes.
-- Yeah.

01:28:01.013 --> 01:28:03.004
-- Well, you have a job.
-- Not for long.

01:28:03.082 --> 01:28:04.709
-- Who told you that?
-- You did.

01:28:04.784 --> 01:28:05.842
That was before.

01:28:05.918 --> 01:28:08.615
-- Before what?
-- Before the ratings surge.

01:28:08.688 --> 01:28:11.680
-- There hasn't been a ratings surge.
-- Oh, there's been a ratings spike.

01:28:11.757 --> 01:28:15.853
-- Dana... -- In the last 10 days, we
have ticked up 2/10 in households,

01:28:15.928 --> 01:28:20.058
3/10 in demos 18 to 49,
18 to 35,

01:28:20.132 --> 01:28:21.930
big market carriers --

01:28:22.001 --> 01:28:24.800
Atlanta, Miami,
San Francisco, Scottsdale --

01:28:24.871 --> 01:28:26.270
Scottsdale's
a big market carrier?

01:28:26.339 --> 01:28:29.274
Lot of sports fans
in Scottsdale, Natalie.

01:28:29.342 --> 01:28:30.776
The tide is turning,

01:28:30.843 --> 01:28:33.813
and you know what you do
when the tide is turning?

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.644
-- Stay with the boat?
-- You stay with the boat.

01:28:35.715 --> 01:28:38.013
You don't go out
on job interviews.

01:28:38.084 --> 01:28:40.018
You told me to.

01:28:40.086 --> 01:28:41.178
In haste.

01:28:42.021 --> 01:28:44.683
Not in haste -- out of
experience and expertise

01:28:44.757 --> 01:28:47.488
in how these things go
when these things go down.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.289
Up 2/10
in the last 10 days!

01:28:49.362 --> 01:28:52.593
It's a momentary thing, Dana.
They're tuning in for Agassi.

01:28:52.665 --> 01:28:55.157
But I'm saying
we build on that.

01:28:55.234 --> 01:28:58.363
Nobody's offered me anything.
I'm going to have an interview.

01:28:58.437 --> 01:29:00.098
-- VVith “Saturday
Night Live.“ -- Yes.

01:29:00.172 --> 01:29:01.469
-- Okay.
-- Do you want the feed?

01:29:01.541 --> 01:29:03.236
-- I'm sorry? -- I said,
“Do you want the feed?“

01:29:03.309 --> 01:29:05.368
-- VVas someone talking? I thought
I heard voices. -- Dana...

01:29:05.444 --> 01:29:07.208
<i>Dave: Roll VTR.
Will: 60 seconds live.</i>

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.044
Chris, tell broadcast we'll
take the Samaranch feed.

01:29:09.115 --> 01:29:11.015
They'll count in from 22.

01:29:11.083 --> 01:29:13.142
Dana, you know about the problem
with the fire alarms in the studio?

01:29:13.219 --> 01:29:15.017
What's the problem with the
fire alarms in the studio?

01:29:15.087 --> 01:29:16.714
They go off when there's
no fire in the studio.

01:29:16.789 --> 01:29:18.518
-- Really? -- <i>They've
been going off at night.</i>

01:29:18.591 --> 01:29:20.753
-- Are they gonna go off during the show?
-- We had them disconnected.

01:29:20.826 --> 01:29:24.729
-- What <i>if</i> there's a fire? -- <i>It's the
studio. You'll see it on television.</i>

01:29:24.797 --> 01:29:27.266
-- Have them connected after the show
and then get this fixed. Elliot: Yeah.

01:29:27.333 --> 01:29:30.428
Dan, the Lakers just scored
14 unanswered in the 4th.

01:29:30.503 --> 01:29:31.971
-- Give it to me in the 10s.
-- You want tape?

01:29:32.038 --> 01:29:33.233
Ask Dana.

01:29:33.306 --> 01:29:34.432
You want tape?

01:29:34.507 --> 01:29:35.872
I'm sorry,
did someone say something?

01:29:35.942 --> 01:29:37.808
That was Jeremy.
You can hear Jeremy.

01:29:37.877 --> 01:29:40.278
Oh. Tape if they get
within 6, Danny.

01:29:40.346 --> 01:29:42.405
-- Thank <i>you.
Dave: 30 seconds live.</i>

01:29:42.481 --> 01:29:43.971
What kind of food
are they serving?

01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:45.074
What do you care?

01:29:45.151 --> 01:29:47.586
I'm just wondering if it's, uh,
native New Jersey cuisine.

01:29:47.653 --> 01:29:49.883
[Scoffs]
It's French.

01:29:49.956 --> 01:29:50.889
-- Ah...
-- Yes.

01:29:50.957 --> 01:29:52.049
I like the French.

01:29:52.124 --> 01:29:53.057
You do?

01:29:53.125 --> 01:29:55.150
Yes, I do.
I like their toast.

01:29:55.227 --> 01:29:56.388
Yes.

01:29:56.462 --> 01:29:58.829
I like their dressing.
I like their fries.

01:29:58.898 --> 01:30:01.367
I like their maids.
I like their kissing.

01:30:01.434 --> 01:30:02.924
[Chuckles]
Okay, right now,

01:30:03.002 --> 01:30:05.471
before we go on the air,
the image of you doing that

01:30:05.538 --> 01:30:07.336
is, like, the last thing
I want in my head.

01:30:07.406 --> 01:30:09.397
-- I like French's Mustard.
-- Casey, come on...

01:30:09.475 --> 01:30:10.738
I like Mr. French.

01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:11.902
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

01:30:11.978 --> 01:30:14.345
Good evening.
Bonsoir from New York City,

01:30:14.413 --> 01:30:17.644
-- [Laughs] -- I'm Casey
McCall alongside Dan Rydell.

01:30:24.123 --> 01:30:25.613
-- Hey.
-- Good morning, Jeremy.

01:30:25.691 --> 01:30:27.819
Tampa's gonna put
La Guardia on waivers.

01:30:27.893 --> 01:30:28.860
Is it on the wire?

01:30:28.928 --> 01:30:30.396
No, but it will be.

01:30:30.463 --> 01:30:32.488
-- Don't you want to know
what I'm doing? -- Okay.

01:30:32.565 --> 01:30:35.262
I'm being pro-active, Jeremy.
I'm rolling up my sleeves.

01:30:35.334 --> 01:30:36.495
You've heard something new?

01:30:36.569 --> 01:30:39.504
In the last 10 days,
we're up 2/10 in households,

01:30:39.572 --> 01:30:42.166
3/10 with demos 18 to 49,
18 to 35.

01:30:42.241 --> 01:30:43.572
Isn't that just Agassi?

01:30:43.643 --> 01:30:45.236
Maybe, maybe not.
But now on the elevator

01:30:45.311 --> 01:30:47.643
I hear Continental Corp
suspended trading for the day

01:30:47.713 --> 01:30:48.646
on the New York
stock exchange.

01:30:48.714 --> 01:30:50.148
-- You know why?
-- No.

01:30:50.216 --> 01:30:52.344
-- Me neither, but I'm gonna find out.
-- Okay.

01:30:52.418 --> 01:30:55.513
So while the rest of you are running around
like chickens with your legs out off,

01:30:55.588 --> 01:30:57.420
-- I'm playing a leadership role.
-- <i>Heads</i> out off.

01:30:57.490 --> 01:31:00.118
-- What? -- We are running around
like chickens with our heads out off.

01:31:00.192 --> 01:31:02.889
-- Right. -- If our legs were out off, we
wouldn't be able to run around at all.

01:31:02.962 --> 01:31:05.260
I'd be able to throw you
around, though, wouldn't I?

01:31:05.331 --> 01:31:06.264
-- Yeah.
-- Okay.

01:31:06.332 --> 01:31:07.424
So what are you doing?

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.763
-- What am I doing?
-- Yeah.

01:31:08.834 --> 01:31:10.768
-- Let's get Socratic.
-- Okay.

01:31:10.836 --> 01:31:12.930
Why is all this happening?

01:31:13.005 --> 01:31:14.131
The cutbacks?

01:31:14.206 --> 01:31:16.106
Well, the cutbacks,
losing the Olympic coverage,

01:31:16.175 --> 01:31:18.644
the deal with Austech,
the threat of layoffs.

01:31:18.711 --> 01:31:20.873
Because Continental Corp's
stock has been dropping.

01:31:20.946 --> 01:31:23.574
'Cause Continental Corp's stock has
been dropping. Yes, very good.

01:31:23.649 --> 01:31:25.617
I see you've been rolling
up your sleeves as well.

01:31:25.685 --> 01:31:28.211
Yes, I'm alive,
and I read the newspaper.

01:31:28.287 --> 01:31:30.153
Okay. Industry analysts
believe that launching

01:31:30.222 --> 01:31:32.213
a cable sports network
in an already saturated market

01:31:32.291 --> 01:31:34.191
-- was a mistake for Continental Corp.
-- Yes.

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:37.924
<i>-- And what's the single biggest budget
expense for this cable network? -- Our show.</i>

01:31:37.997 --> 01:31:40.432
-- “Sports Night.“ Correct.
Excellent. -- Thank you.

01:31:40.499 --> 01:31:42.627
Now, my job isn't
in jeopardy because...

01:31:42.702 --> 01:31:44.363
-- VVell, you're the franchise.
-- That's right.

01:31:44.437 --> 01:31:45.802
Your job isn't
in jeopardy because...

01:31:45.871 --> 01:31:47.965
I don't get paid
very much.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:49.235
Yes.

01:31:49.308 --> 01:31:52.710
It's people like Natalie
whose jobs are in jeopardy.

01:31:52.778 --> 01:31:53.711
Yes.

01:31:53.779 --> 01:31:56.976
-- So what did I do?
-- You rolled up your sleeves.

01:31:57.049 --> 01:31:59.245
-- [Snaps fingers] I got pro-active.
-- Natalie will rest easier.

01:31:59.318 --> 01:32:01.912
The power of the Internet,
my friend. I got on-line.

01:32:01.987 --> 01:32:03.284
I didn't know you knew
how to do that.

01:32:03.355 --> 01:32:04.914
Oh, a guy from tech support
taught me.

01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:06.719
-- Should have asked me.
-- I was a little embarrassed.

01:32:06.792 --> 01:32:08.055
I can't imagine why.

01:32:08.127 --> 01:32:09.617
Look at this morning's
stock quotes.

01:32:09.695 --> 01:32:11.754
We opened up 2 2/8.

01:32:11.831 --> 01:32:13.765
The S&P index has us
over 900

01:32:13.833 --> 01:32:15.892
for the first time
in 18 months,

01:32:15.968 --> 01:32:18.733
and we're very competitive
with MCI WorldCom.

01:32:18.804 --> 01:32:20.294
Couple more days of this,

01:32:20.372 --> 01:32:22.739
and I'm ready to pronounce
this a healthy stock issue

01:32:22.808 --> 01:32:24.572
with a very promising
fiscal outlook.

01:32:24.643 --> 01:32:26.475
Yes.

01:32:26.545 --> 01:32:28.309
You know you're looking
at the stock analysis

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.212
for Continental Coil,
right?

01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:34.012
-- Hmm.
-- Yeah.

01:32:34.086 --> 01:32:36.555
-- Continental Coil.
-- Yes.

01:32:36.622 --> 01:32:38.818
-- That's not us.
-- No.

01:32:38.891 --> 01:32:42.156
"Saturday Night Live,"
of all places.

01:32:42.228 --> 01:32:44.026
Did I tell you
to keep it to yourself?

01:32:44.096 --> 01:32:45.029
Yes.

01:32:45.097 --> 01:32:46.155
-- Did I?
-- Yes.

01:32:46.232 --> 01:32:48.030
You said,
"Doesn't it look to you

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.034
like they're talking
about cutbacks?"

01:32:50.102 --> 01:32:52.594
I said, "Yes." You said,
"Natalie's in jeopardy."

01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:56.198
I said, "Yes."
And what else did I say?

01:32:56.275 --> 01:32:57.674
You said,
"Keep it to yourself."

01:32:57.743 --> 01:32:59.973
I said,
"Keep it to yourself!"

01:33:02.148 --> 01:33:04.173
I said,
"Before we start a panic,

01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:07.220
-- let's know what we're
talking about.“ -- Yes.

01:33:07.286 --> 01:33:09.015
-- Did you keep it to yourself?
-- No.

01:33:09.088 --> 01:33:10.681
-- What did you do?
-- I told Natalie.

01:33:10.756 --> 01:33:12.520
-- And what happened?
-- Panic ensued.

01:33:12.591 --> 01:33:13.558
Plan well-executed.

01:33:13.626 --> 01:33:15.287
-- Are you growing a beard?
-- No.

01:33:15.361 --> 01:33:17.352
-- Did you shave this morning?
-- No.

01:33:17.429 --> 01:33:19.227
-- Why?
-- I like an electric razor.

01:33:19.298 --> 01:33:20.265
You should buy one.

01:33:20.332 --> 01:33:21.663
I have one.
I have four.

01:33:21.734 --> 01:33:23.668
-- You have four electric razors.
-- Yes.

01:33:23.736 --> 01:33:24.794
-- Why?
-- I like them.

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:27.567
Is your electricity
not working?

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.007
Esther baby-proofed
the house.

01:33:30.075 --> 01:33:33.101
[Laughing] Matthew's here.
I totally forgot.

01:33:33.179 --> 01:33:34.704
When was the last time
you saw him?

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.509
About nine months ago --
before the stroke.

01:33:36.582 --> 01:33:37.811
Matthew's here.

01:33:37.883 --> 01:33:39.817
The kid
can't even walk yet.

01:33:39.885 --> 01:33:42.320
Why are we locking
the medicine cabinets?

01:33:42.388 --> 01:33:44.516
-- Does he crawl?
-- Not up walls, no.

01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:45.648
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

01:33:45.724 --> 01:33:47.556
Tampa's gonna put
La Guardia on waivers.

01:33:47.626 --> 01:33:49.492
-- <i>Is that for</i> real?
-- <i>Will be in</i> a <i>few minutes.</i>

01:33:49.562 --> 01:33:51.030
I should go.

01:33:51.096 --> 01:33:52.530
Yes.

01:33:52.598 --> 01:33:54.032
Isn't it great?

01:33:54.099 --> 01:33:55.089
<i>What?</i>

01:33:55.167 --> 01:33:56.100
Matthew's here.

01:33:56.168 --> 01:33:57.260
Get out.

01:33:57.336 --> 01:33:59.168
Okay.

01:34:01.106 --> 01:34:03.598
He's meeting with some
budget guys at 4:00.

01:34:03.676 --> 01:34:04.768
Mitchel?

01:34:04.844 --> 01:34:07.779
Yeah, and Sid Janus
and Janet Alperin.

01:34:07.847 --> 01:34:09.076
You're talking to me.

01:34:09.148 --> 01:34:10.081
Yes.

01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:11.674
I'm just pointing
that out.

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:13.411
-- I'm talking to you again.
-- I'm glad.

01:34:13.485 --> 01:34:15.817
-- What time's your interview?
-- It's on the dinner break.

01:34:15.888 --> 01:34:18.118
Let me tell you why
it's not gonna go well.

01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:22.127
-- What? -- Let me tell you why your
job interview is gonna go very badly.

01:34:22.194 --> 01:34:23.457
Why?

01:34:23.529 --> 01:34:24.963
You're not funny.

01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:26.964
-- I don't need to be funny.
-- Yes, you do.

01:34:27.032 --> 01:34:28.966
They're looking
for a studio producer.

01:34:29.034 --> 01:34:30.968
I don't think I have
to write the show.

01:34:31.036 --> 01:34:32.128
You might.

01:34:32.204 --> 01:34:33.467
-- What?
-- In an emergency.

01:34:33.539 --> 01:34:34.973
What kind of emergency?

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.474
A writer emergency.

01:34:36.542 --> 01:34:38.977
There's not gonna be
a writer emergency.

01:34:39.044 --> 01:34:41.979
There could be. Also, they expect
you to be funny at the control room

01:34:42.047 --> 01:34:45.278
and then later on
at the post-show party.

01:34:47.086 --> 01:34:48.247
I am funny.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.982
No, you're not. You're not
funny in the control room,

01:34:51.056 --> 01:34:52.990
you're not funny
at the post-show party,

01:34:53.058 --> 01:34:55.186
and you are not funny
in a writer emergency.

01:34:55.261 --> 01:34:57.821
-- You're just trying to undermine
my confidence. -- That's right.

01:34:57.897 --> 01:34:59.763
-- What?
-- I said, "That's right."

01:34:59.832 --> 01:35:02.130
You're trying
to undermine my confidence?

01:35:02.201 --> 01:35:04.568
And undermine it I will, for I
am queen of the mind game, baby.

01:35:04.637 --> 01:35:07.937
I am in your head now, and this is me
all day long there, Malibu Barbie.

01:35:08.007 --> 01:35:10.635
-- <i>Dana...</i> -- <i>You're short, and
nobody likes you very much.</i>

01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:11.733
I'm gonna go start
the camera test.

01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:13.574
Princess
of the psych-out, baby!

01:35:17.816 --> 01:35:18.749
Hey.

01:35:18.817 --> 01:35:19.784
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

01:35:19.852 --> 01:35:20.842
I'm in her head now.

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:21.944
-- Good.
-- Good.

01:35:22.021 --> 01:35:24.217
I got the psychological
end of this covered.

01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:27.191
Well, Jeremy and I are taking
care of business over here.

01:35:27.259 --> 01:35:28.021
Good.

01:35:28.093 --> 01:35:29.492
<i>__</i> YEP-
<i>__</i> YEP-

01:35:29.561 --> 01:35:30.995
So we really have
nothing to worry about?

01:35:31.063 --> 01:35:32.531
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

01:35:32.598 --> 01:35:33.861
[Keyboard keys clicking]

01:35:33.933 --> 01:35:35.958
Good.

01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:46.604
Interesting.
Very interesting.

01:35:46.679 --> 01:35:48.443
<i>Casey: Yeah?
What do you got?</i>

01:35:48.514 --> 01:35:50.448
Well, the Dow Jones
industrials are down 4.9%,

01:35:50.516 --> 01:35:53.577
which is its biggest loss
since October 15th,

01:35:53.652 --> 01:35:56.485
<i>while the NASDAQ composite
remained in positive territory.</i>

01:35:56.555 --> 01:35:58.114
-- You know what that means?
-- <i>What?</i>

01:35:58.190 --> 01:35:59.783
No, I'm asking you.

01:35:59.858 --> 01:36:01.826
-- No, do you?
-- No.

01:36:01.894 --> 01:36:02.986
<i>Okay-</i>

01:36:03.062 --> 01:36:03.995
Hey.

<i>-- He'!-
-- HeY-</i>

01:36:05.064 --> 01:36:06.259
Where's Dan?

01:36:06.332 --> 01:36:07.697
Uh, he's got Sprewell
at the Garden.

01:36:07.766 --> 01:36:11.896
Okay, well, then, Jeremy,
can I talk to you for a second?

01:36:11.971 --> 01:36:14.633
Yes. Keep an eye
on this.

01:36:14.707 --> 01:36:16.368
What are
the warning signs?

01:36:16.442 --> 01:36:17.705
<i>What am I looking for?</i>

01:36:17.776 --> 01:36:20.302
Uh, red lights are gonna start
going off on the computer

01:36:20.379 --> 01:36:23.246
with bells and a siren, and
that means we're all in trouble.

01:36:23.315 --> 01:36:24.680
Really?

01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:26.081
Yeah.

01:36:27.219 --> 01:36:28.584
Ohh.

01:36:28.654 --> 01:36:30.122
Dana's been trying
to psych me out.

01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:32.214
-- Really? -- She's been trying
to undermine my confidence

01:36:32.291 --> 01:36:33.258
so I tank the interview.

01:36:33.325 --> 01:36:34.588
That doesn't sound
like Dana.

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:36.253
-- VVell, it's coming from
a place of love. -- Yes.

01:36:36.328 --> 01:36:39.025
Anyway, it's ridiculous, and,
obviously, it's not gonna work.

01:36:39.098 --> 01:36:42.363
But I just wanted a few words of
encouragement, and so I came to you.

01:36:42.434 --> 01:36:44.300
-- No, you came to Dan.
-- And then you.

01:36:44.370 --> 01:36:45.838
-- Okay.
-- So what do you think?

01:36:45.904 --> 01:36:47.429
I think you're
gonna do great.

01:36:47.506 --> 01:36:49.531
You're poised, you're experienced,
you're gonna do fine.

01:36:49.608 --> 01:36:52.942
-- Thank you. -- The only thing I'd
worry about is your limited vocabulary.

01:36:53.012 --> 01:36:54.138
What?

01:36:54.213 --> 01:36:55.840
-- Your extremely limited vocabulary.
-- Jeremy...

01:36:55.914 --> 01:36:57.473
It's not so much that
it's limited,

01:36:57.549 --> 01:36:59.176
it's that you don't <i>know</i>
that it's limited.

01:36:59.251 --> 01:37:01.686
-- Meaning...
-- You frequently misuse words.

01:37:01.754 --> 01:37:03.119
Dana got to you.

01:37:03.188 --> 01:37:05.122
-- You're gonna be fine.
-- Thank you.

01:37:05.190 --> 01:37:06.954
I wouldn't worry
about the height thing.

01:37:07.026 --> 01:37:08.892
[Knocks] A friend! Thank God.
Hey,Dan.

01:37:08.961 --> 01:37:10.827
-- Hey, dumb-ass.
-- Danny!

01:37:10.896 --> 01:37:12.625
I saw Dana
in the hallway.

01:37:12.698 --> 01:37:13.824
I hate all of you.

01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.431
How was the thing
last night?

01:37:16.502 --> 01:37:18.766
It was ridiculous, and I'm not
doing anything like it again.

01:37:18.837 --> 01:37:20.236
Was Marla Maples there?

01:37:20.305 --> 01:37:22.399
That's her name! Yes, she
was there. Thank you.

01:37:22.474 --> 01:37:23.600
-- Nice girl.
-- Lovely girl.

01:37:23.675 --> 01:37:25.336
Saw her in the
"Will Rogers Follies."

01:37:25.411 --> 01:37:27.539
-- The girl can twirl a rope.
-- No doubt about it.

01:37:27.613 --> 01:37:29.877
Anyway, I felt stupid, and I'm
not doing those things anymore.

01:37:29.948 --> 01:37:32.974
-- Okay. -- The high-water mark was when
I was mistaken for a Backstreet Boy.

01:37:33.052 --> 01:37:34.884
-- Is there a Backstreet
Boy I look like? -- Yeah.

01:37:34.953 --> 01:37:36.819
-- Which one?
-- That guy.

01:37:38.123 --> 01:37:39.591
Hey.

01:37:39.658 --> 01:37:41.092
How was the thing
last night?

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.254
I'm firing my publicist.

01:37:43.328 --> 01:37:45.387
-- Really? -- <i>I've invited
him up here to fire him.</i>

01:37:45.464 --> 01:37:46.556
I thought your publicist
was a woman.

01:37:46.632 --> 01:37:49.124
That's my guy's assistant.
My publicist <i>is</i> a man.

01:37:49.201 --> 01:37:51.363
-- And you invited him up
here to fire him -- Yes.

01:37:51.403 --> 01:37:52.768
Instead of doing it
over the phone?

01:37:52.838 --> 01:37:54.135
-- <i>That would've been rude.</i>
-- <i>Sure.</i>

01:37:54.206 --> 01:37:56.106
What are you doing?

01:37:56.175 --> 01:37:58.109
Looking out
for our future.

01:37:58.177 --> 01:37:59.804
-- Really?
-- Yep.

01:38:01.213 --> 01:38:05.275
Hmm...well,
I feel better already.

01:38:08.153 --> 01:38:09.985
<i>Isaac: You're gonna
be terrific.</i>

01:38:10.055 --> 01:38:13.889
-- Thank you. -- And don't worry
about Dana and Danny and Jeremy.

01:38:13.959 --> 01:38:16.121
Everyone wants the best
for you.

01:38:17.362 --> 01:38:19.160
Any last-minute advice?

01:38:19.231 --> 01:38:21.461
Stay away from big words
and don't try to be funny.

01:38:21.533 --> 01:38:23.467
I'm going now.

01:38:23.535 --> 01:38:24.969
-- Hey.
-- I'm going now.

01:38:25.037 --> 01:38:26.596
Is that what
you're wearing?

01:38:26.672 --> 01:38:27.730
<i>I hate you!</i>

01:38:27.806 --> 01:38:29.467
She's totally cooked.

01:38:29.541 --> 01:38:32.067
[Chuckles]
What do you need?

01:38:32.144 --> 01:38:33.339
How did it go?

01:38:33.412 --> 01:38:35.244
-- The budget meeting?
-- Yeah.

01:38:35.314 --> 01:38:36.247
I don't know.

01:38:36.315 --> 01:38:37.476
What do you mean?

01:38:37.549 --> 01:38:38.983
Something's going on.

01:38:39.051 --> 01:38:40.109
Like what?

01:38:40.185 --> 01:38:44.122
Sid Janus
was acting strange.

01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:46.317
Sid Janus
always acts strange.

01:38:46.391 --> 01:38:48.155
Yeah.

01:38:48.227 --> 01:38:50.662
I bought this at lunch.
It's for Matthew.

01:38:50.729 --> 01:38:53.027
What is it?

01:38:53.098 --> 01:38:55.362
Franklin the Turtle.
[Laughs]

01:38:55.434 --> 01:38:56.492
Yeah, he'll like that.

01:38:58.036 --> 01:39:00.437
What is the matter
with you?

01:39:01.607 --> 01:39:02.597
What?

01:39:02.674 --> 01:39:06.201
What's the matter with you? A week
ago, you couldn't wait to see Matthew.

01:39:06.278 --> 01:39:08.246
All you talked about
was Matthew.

01:39:08.313 --> 01:39:10.304
You were driving us nuts
with Matthew.

01:39:10.382 --> 01:39:12.146
Now, all of a sudden,
he's a burden.

01:39:12.217 --> 01:39:13.309
He's not a burden.

01:39:13.385 --> 01:39:15.786
He's a pain in the ass, and you
want him and his parents out.

01:39:15.854 --> 01:39:17.322
That's not true.

01:39:17.389 --> 01:39:19.323

my electric razor."

01:39:19.391 --> 01:39:21.325

the medicine cabinets."

01:39:21.393 --> 01:39:22.792
"I don't like
your turtle puppet."

01:39:22.861 --> 01:39:25.228
I didn't say a word
about the turtle puppet.

01:39:25.297 --> 01:39:27.857
-- Isaac...
-- Matthew's afraid of me.

01:39:27.933 --> 01:39:29.458
-- <i>What</i> do <i>you mean?</i>
-- <i>He's afraid of me.</i>

01:39:29.535 --> 01:39:32.197
When I come to him
to pick him up, he shrieks

01:39:32.271 --> 01:39:35.036
and runs to his mother
or his father or Esther.

01:39:35.107 --> 01:39:38.042
He hasn't seen you
since he was 7 months old.

01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:39.544
He doesn't know you.

01:39:39.611 --> 01:39:40.544
Nah.

01:39:40.612 --> 01:39:41.602
Isaac --

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:43.114
The way I walk --

01:39:43.182 --> 01:39:47.244
I look like the monsters
in cartoons he watches.

01:39:47.319 --> 01:39:50.254
And, you know, late at night
when I come home,

01:39:50.322 --> 01:39:53.849
my speech is worse,
and my facial muscles, uh,

01:39:53.926 --> 01:39:55.860
you know, I try, but...

01:39:55.928 --> 01:39:56.861
Isaac.

01:39:56.929 --> 01:39:58.363
But when I'm tired...

01:39:58.430 --> 01:40:01.195
It's the stroke, Dana.
He's afraid of me.

01:40:01.266 --> 01:40:04.099
<i>Maybe. Maybe.
Maybe right now he is.</i>

01:40:04.169 --> 01:40:07.104
But he's a year and a half
old, and he'll get over it.

01:40:07.172 --> 01:40:11.200
[Chuckles]
Yes, he will.

01:40:11.276 --> 01:40:15.372
And I'm happy to give him
the turtle puppet.

01:40:15.447 --> 01:40:17.643
Okay.

01:40:17.716 --> 01:40:20.515
Anyway...

01:40:20.586 --> 01:40:24.352
Sid Janus
was acting strange.

01:40:26.458 --> 01:40:28.119

-- I have 10 shares.
-- Really?

01:40:39.271 --> 01:40:41.865
I bought it three hours ago. It's
the heartbeat of my portfolio.

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:43.374
People are gonna buy
those cookies.

01:40:43.442 --> 01:40:44.500
That's what I'm saying.

01:40:44.576 --> 01:40:46.567
How many times are the two of
you gonna check that screen?

01:40:46.645 --> 01:40:48.443
Well, we're monitoring
our future, Danny.

01:40:48.513 --> 01:40:49.878
What are you looking for,
exactly?

01:40:49.948 --> 01:40:52.974
Jeremy says there'll be bells and a
siren, then we'll know we're in trouble.

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.613
You know I was kidding
when I said that, right?

01:40:56.688 --> 01:40:58.622
Yeah.

01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:00.021
Okay.

01:41:00.092 --> 01:41:01.958
-- <i>Hey.</i>
-- <i>Catherine.</i>

01:41:02.027 --> 01:41:04.894
-- Am I late?
-- I was expecting Paul.

01:41:04.963 --> 01:41:06.158
Paul sent me.

01:41:06.231 --> 01:41:08.063
-- Why?
-- <i>I'm your account.</i>

01:41:08.133 --> 01:41:10.261
<i>Paul's my account.
You're Paul's assistant.</i>

01:41:10.335 --> 01:41:11.496
And I'm your girl.

Everybody out. I need to
speak to Catherine.

01:41:13.472 --> 01:41:15.270
I've got to monitor
our future, Danny.

01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:17.035
-- We can do it out there.
-- We can?

01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:18.042
-- Yeah.
-- How?

01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:20.772
Every single desk has
a computer terminal out there.

01:41:20.846 --> 01:41:22.780
Yeah, they all have
this stuff on them?

01:41:22.848 --> 01:41:25.545
Yes, Casey, they're all hooked
up to the magical Internet.

01:41:25.617 --> 01:41:27.176
Casey, come on.

01:41:27.252 --> 01:41:29.687

-- Hi.

01:41:36.762 --> 01:41:37.923
You're fired.

01:41:37.996 --> 01:41:38.929
I'm fired?

01:41:38.997 --> 01:41:40.328
Technically, Paul's fired.

01:41:40.399 --> 01:41:41.366
Danny, you're my account.

-- You're my girl?
-- Yeah.

<i>Then you're fired, too.</i>

01:41:43.635 --> 01:41:45.569
You don't think
we're good publicists?

01:41:45.637 --> 01:41:47.901
I think you're fine publicists. I
just don't want to do this anymore.

01:41:47.973 --> 01:41:49.065
Do what anymore?

01:41:49.141 --> 01:41:51.235
I'm not a war correspondent
for Radio Free Europe,

01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:53.039
but I do take
what I do seriously.

01:41:53.111 --> 01:41:55.478
And I just don't want to do
these things anymore.

01:41:55.547 --> 01:41:56.673
You know,
for an hour a night,

01:41:56.748 --> 01:41:58.079
I got three million people
looking at me.

01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:00.244
That's plenty of attention
for one guy.

01:42:00.319 --> 01:42:03.584
-- Okay. -- It was good knowing
you, though. I appreciate the work.

01:42:03.655 --> 01:42:05.282
-- Do you mind if I say something?
-- No.

01:42:05.357 --> 01:42:06.518
You're really
full of it, Dan.

01:42:06.591 --> 01:42:07.683
I don't think I am.

01:42:07.759 --> 01:42:09.523
No, I really think you are.

01:42:09.594 --> 01:42:11.619
There are these things you want, and
you're ashamed that you want them,

01:42:11.697 --> 01:42:13.631
and then you get mad at the people
who try to give them to you.

01:42:13.699 --> 01:42:15.633
<i>And you make
these judgments.</i>

01:42:15.701 --> 01:42:18.363
<i>Like, you decided off the bat
that I'm dumb, which I'm not.</i>

01:42:18.437 --> 01:42:20.872
<i>Being a publicist isn't Radio
Free Europe, either, Danny.</i>

01:42:20.939 --> 01:42:22.236
I know what most people
think of us.

But <i>I</i> wanted to be one,

<i>You want to be famous. I don't think
there's always something wrong with that.</i>

01:42:27.713 --> 01:42:29.374
I'm told being famous
is enjoyable.

01:42:29.448 --> 01:42:31.212
I can understand why
you would want it,

01:42:31.316 --> 01:42:33.785
particularly when it translates
directly into business

01:42:33.852 --> 01:42:36.344
for you and your show at a
time when both could use it.

01:42:36.421 --> 01:42:38.116
You came to us, Danny.

01:42:38.190 --> 01:42:40.090
If you want to fire us,
that's fine,

01:42:40.158 --> 01:42:42.456
but don't look down
your nose at me.

01:42:42.527 --> 01:42:43.926
It's really unbecoming.

Yes.

01:42:52.404 --> 01:42:54.896
All right, one --

01:42:54.973 --> 01:42:56.031
fine, one condition.

01:42:56.108 --> 01:42:57.598
I never have to go
to New Jersey.

01:42:57.676 --> 01:42:59.041
You go where I
tell you to go.

01:42:59.111 --> 01:43:00.169
All right, no conditions.

01:43:00.245 --> 01:43:01.576
-- I'll tell Paul.
-- Fine.

01:43:01.646 --> 01:43:03.580
But I'm your account,
right?

01:43:03.648 --> 01:43:05.742
-- Right.
-- Okay.
