[harmonica plays]

00:08.509 --> 00:09.943
Darlene, how's
the laundry coming?

00:09.977 --> 00:13.247
Oh, it came about as
far as the living room.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.616
Will it be coming to the
actual washing machine?

00:15.649 --> 00:17.017
Oh, eventually.

00:17.051 --> 00:20.354
I mean, it's pretty whopped from
the first leg of its journey.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.156
Darlene, I'd like
to take a shower.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.924
It would be nice
to have a towel.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.159
All right, let me
just finish this.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.161
No, you work
around our schedule,

00:27.195 --> 00:29.197
not the other way around.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.765
Ah, you see, Becky
worked around your schedule

00:31.799 --> 00:33.434
because she didn't have a life.

00:33.467 --> 00:37.538
Fortunately, you've raised
me to defy authority.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.706
Now.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.141
The Fuhrer needs
a fluff and fold.

00:40.174 --> 00:40.974
I got to go.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.246
Oh hell, look at this.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.115
We got flyers again.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.283
Spray and spray, but
they keep coming back.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.622
Would you please fold that
laundry, and put it away?

00:54.655 --> 00:55.456
OK.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.060
Any luck with the job hunt?

01:00.094 --> 01:01.962
Yeah, actually,
one place offered me

01:01.995 --> 01:03.831
an executive position.

01:03.864 --> 01:08.502
But unfortunately I'm
allergic to corn dog batter.

01:08.536 --> 01:11.805
Pity, however, my
story is one of success.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.708
Today, I fixed a kids
bicycle chain for $5.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.644
Swimming pools, movie star.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.682
What's for dinner?

01:21.715 --> 01:25.085
Well DJ, even though mommy was
out all day looking for a job,

01:25.119 --> 01:28.088
she still had time to
plan tonight's menu.

01:28.122 --> 01:32.760
Go through these pizza ads, and
order whatever's two for one.

01:32.793 --> 01:33.861
Did Becky call?

01:33.894 --> 01:34.762
Yeah.

01:34.795 --> 01:35.829
So, what she have to say?

01:35.863 --> 01:36.730
I don't know.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.699
You'd have to ask Darlene.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.301
How long is this
gonna go on, Dan?

01:40.334 --> 01:42.970
She's called every single day.

01:43.003 --> 01:45.173
So what, you're not gonna
talk to her for the whole rest

01:45.206 --> 01:47.107
of your life?

01:47.141 --> 01:50.911
Hey, there's a new
place called final notice.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.745
Give me that.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.983
It's from the electric company.

01:56.016 --> 01:56.884
DAN: Ugh.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.051
They're cutting
us off at five.

01:58.085 --> 01:58.952
DAN: Ugh.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.988
Didn't you pay that bill?

02:01.021 --> 02:04.558
Well, I had to choose between
water and electricity, Dan.

02:04.592 --> 02:08.562
And you can only live
two days without water.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.998
Sure, I can take a bath, but
I can't throw the toaster in.

02:15.068 --> 02:19.407
Hello, this is, uh, Roseanne
Conner, 714 Delaware street.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.408
No, I can't hold.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.875
Ugh, I'm on hold.

02:21.909 --> 02:22.976
How far behind are we?

02:23.010 --> 02:24.845
I don't know, a few months.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.814
I can't believe they're
cutting us off after the very

02:26.847 --> 02:27.748
first final notice.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.919
Hello?

02:31.952 --> 02:35.356
Well, OK, I got this kind
of a warning on my door nob

02:35.389 --> 02:37.157
from you guys saying
that you're gonna

02:37.191 --> 02:39.760
cut us off at 5:00, which is,
like, in about three minutes.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.197
What am I supposed to do?

02:43.231 --> 02:44.598
Well-- hey, I-- I--

02:44.632 --> 02:46.500
s-- I sent a check in there.

02:46.534 --> 02:50.338
It ain't my fault if
you guys didn't get it.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.641
Well, no.
I can't get down that fast.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.542
Hey, I know.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.109
You're there.

02:56.143 --> 02:59.947
Why don't you write a check, and
then I'll cover it on Monday?

02:59.980 --> 03:00.781
I'm good for it.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.252
We're screwed.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.723
OK, listen up, family.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.859
If anybody has anything
to do this weekend

03:11.892 --> 03:16.196
that requires electricity,
you got about two minutes.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.400
Oh rats, and it was my
turn to vacuum the house.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.969
I'll try to dig up some
flashlights and candles.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.037
I'm gonna watch TV.

03:24.071 --> 03:24.872
Way to help out, Son.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.646
Well, I better
turn up the fridge.

03:38.419 --> 03:42.222
Well, middle class was fun.

Don't forget stupid.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.112
All right, everyone,
more flashlight fun.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.381
Everybody grab one in each hand.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.617
Turn them on, and wave
around on the wall.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.454
[humming in-a-gadda-da-vida]

04:48.922 --> 04:55.563
Oh look it, it's a laser show
at the Iron Butterfly concert.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.532
All right, enough.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.034
Hey, my battery is dead.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.370
Oh, no problem, DJ.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.938
Get the one out of
the smoke detector.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.474
That's dangerous, Darlene.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.242
What if I need it for
the remote control?

05:09.276 --> 05:11.111
Hey Deej, forget
the flashlights.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.012
Come on down here, Son.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.851
You know, when I was
a kid, my grandpa

05:17.885 --> 05:21.922
used to tell me about when he
was a kid before there was TV.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.858
They used to sit around
and tell stories.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.326
What kind of stories?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.227
I don't know.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.462
That was his best one.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.130
But I bet your Mom could
make up a good one.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.031
Couldn't you, honey?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.100
Oh OK, let's see.

05:33.133 --> 05:37.037
Um, um, um, um, um,
um, um, um, um, um.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.707
Ah, I got one, OK.

05:39.740 --> 05:43.577
Well, once upon a time, there
was these four princesses.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.480
And they lived in this great
big house all together,

05:46.514 --> 05:48.148
and they never left, OK?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.850
And, uh, they just
sat around all

05:49.883 --> 05:54.021
the time talking and talking,
and yammering and yammering.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.390
And they killed every single
man who ever came over there.

05:56.424 --> 06:00.394
Except for one, who
they kept as a pet.

06:00.428 --> 06:03.063
And then, one time,
these two princesses

06:03.096 --> 06:05.399
left, and then these
other two came on,

06:05.433 --> 06:06.434
and they really stunk and--

06:06.467 --> 06:07.735
Mom, that's "Designing Women."

06:12.072 --> 06:13.574
Oh, you figured it out.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.308
Let me try and make on up.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.444
Go for it, Son.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.179
I'm in hell.

06:19.212 --> 06:24.818
OK, um, there was a guy, and
he was walking down the street.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.987
And he kept walking.

06:27.020 --> 06:32.359
Then he found something,
and then he lost it.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.996
And there was this
car with a guy in it.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.731
Then he got something.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.770
And there was this dog.

06:42.803 --> 06:47.374
And he was barking because
the window was open.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.478
Not so much he could
jump out, but, um--

06:53.781 --> 06:54.582
The end.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.752
Darlene.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.654
I'm sorry, but this bites.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.622
Yeah.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.858
it really kind of does.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.259
Hey, I got an idea.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.562
Why don't me and you, tomorrow,
we'll go do something together.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.598
Something real special.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.232
Like what?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.634
I don't know.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.337
Maybe we could go soak up some
electricity down at the mall.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.940
I don't do the mall, Mother.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.375
Oh, come on, it'd be
a lot of fun, you know?

07:22.409 --> 07:24.678
Uh, Becky and I used
to go down there, OK?

07:24.712 --> 07:26.046
And this one time--

07:26.079 --> 07:30.117
[laughs] One time we are over
at, uh, Rodbells, you know?

07:30.150 --> 07:33.921
And, uh, we went in and we, uh,
stuck all the mannequins skirts

07:33.954 --> 07:36.757
right up there butt, you know?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.959
And then we went over
to Hickory Farms,

07:38.992 --> 07:41.294
and we squeezed all the
cheese logs and ran.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.766
What do you say?

07:45.799 --> 07:46.700
[knock at door]

07:46.734 --> 07:48.168
Please let that
be child welfare.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.473
It's about time.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.542
Sorry.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.109
Hey, Mrs. Conner, Mr. Conner.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.511
Son.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.146
This is weird.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.648
When you gonna have light again?

08:00.681 --> 08:03.016
Oh, just as soon
as the Earth spins

08:03.050 --> 08:05.986
back around towards the sun.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.988
OK, well, we're out of here.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.659
Whoa, whoa, where you going?

08:11.692 --> 08:12.993
Upstairs to work on our comic.

08:13.026 --> 08:13.894
Alone?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.028
With no lights on?

08:15.062 --> 08:16.429
I don't think so.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.131
Well, what do you
think we're gonna do?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.433
If I think about
it, you're grounded.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.035
No, I want you to
stay down here.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.871
If you want, you can
work it the kitchen.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.273
What, and be distracted by all
the fun you're having in here?

08:26.306 --> 08:27.975
I couldn't concentrate.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.276
Keep running back
in every time I

08:29.309 --> 08:32.780
thought of a new shadow puppet.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.681
This is stupid.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.615
Let's go.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.149
Get back down here!

08:36.183 --> 08:37.951
- Come on.
- Darlene.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.787
David, which one of
us could hurt you more?

08:43.223 --> 08:45.559
I'm not sure.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.760
Dad, we're just gonna work.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.361
Why are you assuming
something is gonna happen?

08:48.395 --> 08:50.764
I mean, come on, he's not Mark.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.633
That's true, Dan.

08:52.666 --> 08:56.704
Mark had a sexy, kind of,
dangerous thing going on.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.537
This is David.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.374
Yeah, OK.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.209
Go ahead.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.281
[music playing]

09:15.322 --> 09:16.556
OK, where were we?

09:16.590 --> 09:17.490
Right here?

09:17.524 --> 09:18.892
No, come on, David.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.128
We've got to finish this.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.231
OK, uh, right.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.033
Here's where you
had the skinless man

09:26.066 --> 09:28.936
pinning the moth woman alive
to the collectors board.

09:28.969 --> 09:32.640
Hey, look at the size of
the moth woman's breasts.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.540
So?

09:33.573 --> 09:34.708
So, they're huge.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.144
They weren't like that before.

09:37.177 --> 09:41.148
She was a caterpillar
before, for God's sake.

09:41.181 --> 09:45.052
Look at this, all the
women have enormous breasts.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.187
I just thought they'd be
more interesting that way.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.192
You're just
getting off on this.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.861
I mean, look at some of the
stuff you've got them doing.

09:53.894 --> 09:54.795
I didn't write this sleaze.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.797
Is this all you think about?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.498
Yeah, I think about it.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.368
Thinking about it
is all I can do.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.170
What's that supposed to mean?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.005
Come on, Darlene.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.474
We've been going
out for a while.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.876
There's a lot of
people that have

10:08.909 --> 10:12.512
been going out for a lot less,
and they're doing a lot more.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.747
All right.

10:13.781 --> 10:14.614
Well, let's do it right now.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.858
You know, you make it
sound like it's a bad thing,

10:24.892 --> 10:27.127
when all I want to do
is get closer to you.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.031
I thought, you know,
we're here, and it's dark.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.634
I thought, maybe, we
could mess around.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.069
If I feel like
messing around--

10:36.103 --> 10:40.473
and I am extremely flattered
that you call it that--

10:40.507 --> 10:42.042
then I'll let you know.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.312
Till then, chill.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.015
OK, I'm sorry.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.582
Let's just get back to work.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.918
Fine.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.787
You can start by erasing those.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.323
And those.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.224
And that.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.806
Oh, you guys are
not going to believe

11:12.840 --> 11:18.879
the time I had at that
singles dance last night.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.914
I haven't been home yet.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.916
Not that I met
anybody or anything.

11:22.950 --> 11:27.721
But Nancy and I had a few,
so I just decided to crash

11:27.755 --> 11:29.022
at her place for a while.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.992
You know, just,
uh, for the night.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.927
You ought to, um,
turn the freezer up.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.462
It's getting kind
of warm in there.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.596
Anyway--

11:36.629 --> 11:38.665
Um, Jackie, let me make
you some breakfast, OK?

11:38.698 --> 11:39.767
Roseanne, it's like--

11:39.800 --> 11:41.769
I'm right in the middle
of a story here, OK?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.436
Anyway, the second
we walk in the door

11:43.470 --> 11:46.940
it's like Nancy starts throwing
herself at any jerk who

11:46.974 --> 11:48.842
is wearing Old Spice.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.044
Which, like, leaves
me completely alone.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.414
Having to fight off this
whole parade of losers.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.684
This one guy actually
said, you're under arrest

11:57.717 --> 11:59.820
for stealing my heart.

11:59.853 --> 12:04.557
It [inaudible] pathetic.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.594
I just want to see if
any of them called.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.470
Hey, there's message from
you on here, Roseanne.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.539
What do you need candles
and flashlights for?

12:23.543 --> 12:26.446
Oh.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.115
Well, we don't
have any lights,

12:28.148 --> 12:29.783
but now we know the
speed of stupid.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.625
How was I supposed to
know they cut your power?

12:38.658 --> 12:40.894
Well, we thought maybe
the lack of electricity

12:40.928 --> 12:41.995
might tip you off.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.497
[phone rings]

12:44.531 --> 12:46.366
Hey, you want to
shut down that blender?

12:46.399 --> 12:50.003
I can't hear.

12:50.037 --> 12:50.904
Hello?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.772
It's for you.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.742
What, is it Becky?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.878
I'm sick of making up all
these excuses for you, Dan.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.112
You want to hang up
on your daughter?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.547
You hang up on her yourself.

13:00.580 --> 13:04.751
Come on, Deej, let's go
work off that breakfast.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.221
Uh, Becky, Hey.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.556
No.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.591
No, they're just having a
problem with the electricity.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.661
So he had to go change a fuse.

13:14.694 --> 13:17.630
And, uh, they will probably call
you back in just a little bit,

13:17.664 --> 13:19.432
OK?
Sure.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.834
Bye bye.

13:20.868 --> 13:24.404
Roseanne, this thing with Dan
and Becky can't go on forever.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.605
I know.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.641
Sooner or later they'll
cut the phone off too.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.444
No, now come on.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.645
First thing's first.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.883
How do we get the
electricity back on?

13:35.916 --> 13:38.085
You pay the bill.

13:38.118 --> 13:38.986
Good.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.020
Good, good, good.

13:40.053 --> 13:43.290
OK, how fast can
they restore service?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.758
Well, they said if they got
the cash early enough on Monday

13:45.792 --> 13:48.528
then they would turn everything
back on whenever the hell

13:48.561 --> 13:49.863
they feel like it.

13:49.897 --> 13:53.166
No, that's not right.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.302
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna make
a call, and see if they can

13:55.335 --> 13:57.905
get it on any sooner than that.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.073
Did you tell them
you have children?

14:00.107 --> 14:01.274
Yeah, they don't want them.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.096
Morning.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.431
David, you're early.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.933
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm early.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.134
I-- I just got here.

14:27.167 --> 14:31.104
I couldn't sleep at my
house, where I was before.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.806
Well, I guess you had
kind of a rough night, huh?

14:33.840 --> 14:37.644
Come on in, honey, and
tell me all about it.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.547
You are dead!
- Mom, wait.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.448
No you wait, Darlene.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.749
Nothing happened, Mom!

14:42.782 --> 14:44.317
I trusted you.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.119
What'd I miss?

14:46.153 --> 14:47.420
We were working
on the comic book.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.588
We hit this great
roll, and we ended up

14:48.621 --> 14:49.489
pulling an all-nighter.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.158
That's all that happened, OK?

14:51.191 --> 14:52.425
Ohhh.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.760
Hey, Rose, did you--

14:53.793 --> 14:55.996
David, you're back again?

14:56.029 --> 14:56.930
Don't you have a home?

14:56.964 --> 14:57.830
Yes.

14:57.864 --> 14:58.966
Don't they miss you there?

14:58.999 --> 14:59.799
Yes.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.736
The first thing this
morning, there here

15:03.770 --> 15:06.039
is knocking on the door again.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.175
You know, I think you guys are
seeing too much of each other.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.210
You should go home now, David.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.313
Yeah, uh, goodnight--

15:13.346 --> 15:16.049
I mean, bye.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.419
[music playing]

15:24.824 --> 15:26.093
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.364
Did you tell Dad?

15:31.398 --> 15:35.969
No, you're much
more use to me alive.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.904
Thanks for not
going psychotic on us.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.905
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.109
I was just trying
to be a cool mom.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.111
I appreciate it.

15:44.144 --> 15:48.615
Yeah, and as cool
mom, uh, I want

15:48.648 --> 15:50.017
to save you from some
of the embarrassment

15:50.050 --> 15:51.284
that Becky went through.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.920
So I'm just going to go ahead
and bring this up first.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.788
Bring what up first?

15:55.822 --> 15:58.691
Uh, Monday we'll go
to the gynecologist

15:58.725 --> 16:01.261
and get ya some birth control.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.963
Why?

16:03.997 --> 16:05.232
Well, because I
just don't think I'm

16:05.265 --> 16:09.569
responsible enough to
be a grandmother yet.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.670
Nothing happened last night.

16:10.703 --> 16:11.938
I told you that.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.873
Oh, Darlene, he spent the
whole night in your room.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.508
I'm not stupid.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.876
Yeah, well, neither
am I. First of all,

16:16.909 --> 16:18.478
I don't want to have sex yet.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.513
And second, you think I'd
do it with you 20 feet away?

16:20.547 --> 16:21.814
Why not?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.350
You could do it real quiet
without us knowing about it.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.251
Really?

16:24.284 --> 16:25.085
You can't.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.476
You mean you can hear us?

16:49.509 --> 16:52.179
Last night I had to tell
David you were moving furniture.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.353
Well, fine.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.688
We're not talking
about my sex life.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.258
I'm an adult. We're talking
about your sex life.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.327
I don't have a sex life.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.362
But if I did, I wouldn't tell
you because I don't think

17:09.396 --> 17:10.697
it's any of your business.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.665
And unlike your other daughter,
if I needed birth control

17:12.699 --> 17:14.701
I'd know how to
take care of myself.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.269
I don't need you
to hold my hand.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.204
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.406
Why won't you just
let me do this?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.307
Oh, I see.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.041
This is for you.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.110
Well, how about this?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.544
We'll go get me birth
control tomorrow.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.379
I'll go have sex with
David, and then we

17:26.413 --> 17:28.248
can celebrate at the mall.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.117
That should be your perfect day.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.285
Darlene!

17:32.319 --> 17:34.020
Darlene, you get back here!

17:34.053 --> 17:35.322
Leave me alone.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.791
I am just trying
to be nice, dammit!

17:38.825 --> 17:40.293
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.528
Can I some money
for a movie, please?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.697
Sorry, all I have is hundreds.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.233
We're not done
talking, Darlene.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.134
Fine.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.435
Look, then just anything.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.869
Just a few bucks so I can
get out of the stupid house

17:49.902 --> 17:50.770
and do something.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.239
You're not going anywhere.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.540
This discussion
is over, Mother.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.642
I'm not going to relive
some gynecological bonding

17:55.675 --> 17:56.809
moment you had with Becky.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.311
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.213
You want to tell me what
we're talking about here?

18:00.247 --> 18:01.481
I'll tell you later.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.949
No, let's tell him now.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.084
Mom wants me to go on the
pill because Becky had sex.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.158
I don't think that'll work.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.631
I don't think that this is the
proper time for you to discuss

18:18.665 --> 18:19.899
this with your father, Darlene.

18:19.932 --> 18:20.800
Why not?

18:20.833 --> 18:23.136
I have nothing to hide.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.104
David never left last night.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.906
We stayed up all night long
working on the comic book.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.007
I'm sorry.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.376
I screwed up, but I
didn't sleep with him.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.512
ROSEANNE: Shh, calm down,
I'm handling this, Dan.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.646
No, I'm handling this.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.614
There's nothing to handle.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.515
Don't you listen?

18:35.548 --> 18:36.816
Yeah, I heard!

18:36.849 --> 18:39.219
And I'll be damned if I'm
gonna let this happen twice.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.487
You are not going
to see David again.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.654
Do you hear me, Darlene?

18:41.688 --> 18:42.855
I don't believe this.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.591
You guys are both treating
me like I'm Becky.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.825
I'm not Becky.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.026
I don't go to the
mall like Becky.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.628
I don't do great
laundry like Becky.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.996
I don't love school like Becky.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.932
And I don't sleep with
my boyfriend like Becky.

18:52.965 --> 18:57.069
So, what are you
getting at, Becky?

18:57.103 --> 18:58.838
What I'm getting at,
Mother, is I'm stuck here.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.340
So I'm paying for
how she screwed up.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.409
If you guys have a problem
you deal with Becky.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.243
Leave me out of it.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.854
Remember how excited we were
when she first learned to talk?

19:20.293 --> 19:22.729
Think she's telling the truth?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.197
Well, if she went
to all the trouble

19:24.231 --> 19:27.600
of saying it in front of you,
I guess she'd have to be.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.636
You should have
told me, Roseanne.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.505
I don't even know what I
can tell you anymore, Dan,

19:32.539 --> 19:34.974
and what I can't tell you
cause you already got one kid

19:35.007 --> 19:36.008
that you won't even talk to.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.485
Stuff happens around here,
I should know about it.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.486
OK.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.389
Well, brace yourself.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.759
The kids can hear
you having sex.

19:52.792 --> 19:56.128
[music playing]

20:29.296 --> 20:30.196
BECKY (ON PHONE): Hello?

20:30.229 --> 20:31.097
Hey, Beck.

20:31.130 --> 20:31.998
BECKY (ON PHONE): Dad?

20:32.031 --> 20:33.099
Yeah, it's me.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.201
How you doing?
- I'm good.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.003
How are you doing?

20:37.036 --> 20:37.904
DAN (ON PHONE): I'm OK.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.906
Good to hear your voice

20:39.939 --> 20:43.676
Yeah, it's good to
hear your voice, too.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.878
So, how's mom?

20:45.912 --> 20:46.713
She's fine.

20:50.850 --> 20:54.421
So, I heard it was, uh, really
cold up there last week.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.788
And I was just wondering
if your landlord

20:55.822 --> 20:57.490
put in the storm windows yet.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.692
BECKY (ON PHONE): No, I don't
think we have them, Dad.

20:59.726 --> 21:00.627
Well, that's crazy.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.061
You're gonna freeze.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.763
OK listen, here's what you do.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.231
Just go down to any
hardware store and you

21:05.264 --> 21:08.435
get this stuff, plastic
window insulator.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.070
Now you want the indoor
kit not the outdoor kit.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.105
OK, Beck?

21:13.139 --> 21:15.141
Now, all you do is
you fit the plastic

21:15.174 --> 21:16.343
to the size of the window.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.810
BECKY (ON PHONE): Listen,
Dad, you know, I don't

21:17.844 --> 21:19.679
know much about this stuff.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.748
No, no, honey
it's not that hard.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.416
You just shrink the
plastic with a hairdryer.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.085
I know you know how
to use one of those.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.754
BECKY (ON PHONE): Dad,
maybe you should be talking

21:35.962 --> 21:37.330
Hey, Mark.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.331
How's it going?

21:38.365 --> 21:39.932
MARK (ON PHONE): Fine, and you?

21:39.966 --> 21:41.100
Real good.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.736
