01:27.685 --> 01:28.852
This is McKewan.

01:28.853 --> 01:29.952
I'm at GPS coordinates

01:29.953 --> 01:33.251
48.98 by 32.316 on Vinci Ridge

01:33.252 --> 01:33.919
nine miles south of

01:33.920 --> 01:36.353
the main town of Ascension.

01:36.354 --> 01:37.617
Test beacon 21 has

01:37.618 --> 01:38.717
Recorded another occurrence

01:38.718 --> 01:41.651
At 010-hundred.

01:41.652 --> 01:42.553
We're commencing

01:42.554 --> 01:43.884
The next imaging testing.

01:43.885 --> 01:45.150
I'm initiating sequence

01:45.151 --> 01:48.083
in five, four, three,

01:48.084 --> 01:50.751
Two, and one.

01:50.752 --> 01:51.752
Mark.

02:02.918 --> 02:05.152
What was that?

02:12.353 --> 02:13.353
Okay, the graph's

02:13.354 --> 02:14.584
Going crazy here.

02:14.585 --> 02:15.351
That was another.

02:15.451 --> 02:16.683
Ground temperature's rising.

02:16.684 --> 02:17.215
I'm getting readings

02:17.216 --> 02:18.650
from all over the Mountain.

02:18.651 --> 02:19.883
We got multiple occurrences

02:19.884 --> 02:22.249
In sector seven, sector nine.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.151
Check your vectors.

02:23.152 --> 02:25.784
I'm calling control.

02:25.785 --> 02:27.115
We have multiple readings.

02:27.116 --> 02:27.983
Repeat, multiple readings

02:27.984 --> 02:29.016
On the anomaly.

02:29.017 --> 02:30.351
The singularity could be viable.

02:30.352 --> 02:31.352
Confidence is high.

02:31.353 --> 02:32.383
Repeat, confidence is high!

02:32.384 --> 02:33.351
Do you copy?

02:33.352 --> 02:36.851
Do not copy.

02:41.451 --> 02:42.183
Control, do you copy?

02:42.184 --> 02:43.616
McKewan!

02:46.183 --> 02:48.015
O'Neil!

02:48.016 --> 02:49.582
Are you okay?

02:52.816 --> 02:54.681
Oh, my God!

02:54.682 --> 02:55.451
Radio: Tracking system

02:55.452 --> 02:56.550
Has been activated.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.114
Secure the device.

02:58.115 --> 03:01.350
Priority is the device.

03:38.915 --> 03:41.048
Timber!

03:52.382 --> 03:54.247
Whoa!

03:57.481 --> 03:58.512
Come on, boys.

03:58.513 --> 04:00.146
Greg rumbles more

04:00.148 --> 04:01.681
when he eats chili.

04:02.081 --> 04:05.513
Get back to work.

04:05.514 --> 04:06.247
Give me a hand over here,

04:06.247 --> 04:07.013
Will you?

04:07.014 --> 04:09.080
Sure.

04:09.081 --> 04:10.047
Hey, Thomas!

04:10.048 --> 04:11.813
Yeah, Joe?

04:15.180 --> 04:16.346
Is this ours?

04:16.348 --> 04:17.147
I found it over there

04:17.148 --> 04:21.146
By that tree.

04:21.147 --> 04:25.013
Never seen anything like it.

04:25.014 --> 04:25.848
Trying to get free satellite

04:25.848 --> 04:26.648
Again or something?

04:26.649 --> 04:28.814
You think that could help?

04:32.712 --> 04:33.646
Whoa, hey.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.348
What the hell was that?

04:38.847 --> 04:39.746
All right, get away

04:39.747 --> 04:41.946
From the trees!

04:41.947 --> 04:43.348
What's going on?

04:45.746 --> 04:47.480
You hear that?

04:51.347 --> 04:52.446
Joe!

04:52.447 --> 04:53.380
Come on!

04:53.380 --> 04:54.046
Get that thing off his leg!

04:54.047 --> 04:59.711
Oh, God!

04:59.712 --> 05:00.279
Looks like it hurts!

05:00.280 --> 05:02.380
Oh, I need a lawyer!

05:03.746 --> 05:04.445
You know what it

05:04.445 --> 05:05.179
Looks like to me?

05:05.179 --> 05:06.011
What?

05:06.011 --> 05:06.779
You're spending football

05:06.779 --> 05:07.612
Season on the couch.

05:07.612 --> 05:08.378
Oh, God, let it be

05:08.378 --> 05:09.146
Eight weeks.

05:09.146 --> 05:09.846
I'm gonna get the truck,

05:09.846 --> 05:10.612
Get you some help, all right?

05:10.613 --> 05:11.845
Okay.

05:11.846 --> 05:13.477
I hate mondays.

05:13.478 --> 05:15.878
Smitty!

05:20.012 --> 05:20.778
Get on the phone and figure out

05:20.778 --> 05:21.579
What the hell that was

05:21.580 --> 05:22.645
And don't take earthquake

05:22.646 --> 05:23.411
For an answer.

05:23.412 --> 05:26.346
No freakin' earthquake!

05:42.077 --> 05:43.344
All right, boys.

05:43.345 --> 05:44.576
It's gonna hurt like hell,

05:44.577 --> 05:45.676
So let's do it quick.

05:45.677 --> 05:49.378
All right.

05:49.379 --> 05:50.544
Wait, wait!

05:50.545 --> 05:51.709
One, two, three!

05:51.710 --> 05:52.610
Three.

05:52.610 --> 05:53.346
All right, be careful

05:53.346 --> 05:53.977
Of that leg.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.075
Putting on weight, huh?

05:55.076 --> 05:56.044
You are one tough

05:56.045 --> 05:58.242
Son of a bitch, Joe.

05:58.243 --> 05:59.843
Joe! Joe!

05:59.844 --> 06:00.277
Hold on a second!

06:00.278 --> 06:01.776
What? What's wrong?

06:01.777 --> 06:04.477
Joe?

06:04.478 --> 06:08.910
Joe! Joe!

06:12.976 --> 06:14.809
He's dead.

06:26.077 --> 06:27.575
No, this is regarding

06:27.576 --> 06:28.576
The sensors on Lincoln.

06:28.577 --> 06:29.642
We think two of the boxes

06:29.643 --> 06:32.942
May be malfunctioning.

06:32.943 --> 06:33.975
I don't know.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.808
That's why I need someone

06:35.809 --> 06:37.508
Out there.

06:37.509 --> 06:38.742
Daniel?

06:38.743 --> 06:40.343
Daniel!

06:40.344 --> 06:41.642
What?

06:41.643 --> 06:42.576
I'm sorry.

06:42.577 --> 06:43.708
I'm gonna have to call you back.

06:43.709 --> 06:44.808
Please just see what you can do.

06:44.809 --> 06:46.342
Okay, thank you.

06:46.343 --> 06:47.343
What is it?

06:47.344 --> 06:48.641
Mount Lincoln again,

06:48.642 --> 06:50.342
Another 4.3 over the southwest

06:50.343 --> 06:52.908
Subduction zone.

06:52.909 --> 06:54.375
Look at that low-level reading.

06:54.376 --> 06:55.674
I knew something was off.

06:55.675 --> 06:57.574
It's almost six minutes long.

06:57.575 --> 06:58.975
That's not a tremor.

06:58.976 --> 06:59.876
It's almost like

06:59.876 --> 07:00.276
A slow-moving plate shift.

07:00.277 --> 07:01.907
Can that be?

07:01.908 --> 07:03.741
Well, you know, you didn't

07:03.742 --> 07:04.507
Have to hit me with

07:04.507 --> 07:05.476
A coffee cup.

07:05.476 --> 07:06.343
I'm a human being.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.343
I got feelings.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.774
Be happy I couldn't

07:08.775 --> 07:09.841
Reach the stapler.

07:09.842 --> 07:10.609
You know what?

07:10.609 --> 07:11.408
I'm gonna have to go up there

07:11.408 --> 07:12.142
And do some field readings.

07:12.143 --> 07:13.342
This is not adding up.

07:13.343 --> 07:14.008
Wait, wait, wait.

07:14.008 --> 07:14.807
You're gonna go up there?

07:14.807 --> 07:15.509
Yeah.

07:15.510 --> 07:16.575
That volcano isn't

07:16.576 --> 07:17.475
Listed as dormant.

07:17.475 --> 07:18.407
It's extinct.

07:18.408 --> 07:19.706
It hasn't so much as belched

07:19.707 --> 07:21.105
In thousands of years.

07:21.106 --> 07:22.341
You never lived up there.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.105
Place shakes all the time.

07:24.106 --> 07:24.907
May very well have

07:24.908 --> 07:26.040
Entered into a new phase.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.441
I will contact you

07:27.442 --> 07:28.540
When I get there.

07:28.541 --> 07:30.040
Let Dr. Hayes know.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.074
Isn't this a bit rash?

07:32.075 --> 07:32.908
I mean, shouldn't you

07:32.908 --> 07:33.808
Just see if they can send

07:33.808 --> 07:34.775
Someone out to check?

07:34.776 --> 07:36.172
It is gonna take a whole lot

07:36.173 --> 07:37.440
More than those printouts

07:37.441 --> 07:38.408
To convince the locals

07:38.409 --> 07:39.441
There is something up,

07:39.442 --> 07:40.572
Especially their

07:40.573 --> 07:44.005
Hard-headed sheriff.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.441
How do you know that?

07:46.442 --> 07:50.740
He's my Uncle.

07:50.741 --> 07:52.906
So long.

08:10.439 --> 08:11.839
Thomas.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.405
Sheriff.

08:15.406 --> 08:16.440
You okay?

08:16.441 --> 08:17.239
Well, as okay as

08:17.239 --> 08:17.972
I'm gonna be.

08:17.973 --> 08:19.671
Figure anything out?

08:19.672 --> 08:24.340
No. Well, nothing conclusive.

08:24.341 --> 08:27.604
They're gonna do an autopsy.

08:27.605 --> 08:30.840
That should tell us more.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.504
It's the craziest thing,

08:34.505 --> 08:35.440
Sheriff.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.171
Well, you said that

08:36.172 --> 08:37.236
He broke his leg, right?

08:37.238 --> 08:38.072
That was it?

08:38.072 --> 08:39.072
Yeah.

08:39.073 --> 08:40.138
He got hit by a branch.

08:40.139 --> 08:41.472
He got busted up pretty good.

08:41.472 --> 08:43.038
I've seen worse.

08:43.039 --> 08:43.905
We've seen worse.

08:43.905 --> 08:45.570
I just wanted to get him

08:45.571 --> 08:46.439
Off the hill.

08:46.439 --> 08:47.340
I went to grab the truck.

08:47.341 --> 08:49.737
Maybe I shouldn't have left.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.237
Okay, come on.

08:52.238 --> 08:54.170
You can't blame yourself.

08:54.171 --> 08:57.439
So do you want me

08:57.440 --> 08:58.373
To give you a ride home?

08:58.374 --> 09:00.270
No, no.

09:00.271 --> 09:01.571
You sure?

09:01.572 --> 09:02.472
Yeah.

09:02.473 --> 09:04.837
I'm good, sheriff. Thanks.

09:04.838 --> 09:09.036
I just want to figure out

09:09.037 --> 09:10.639
What happened up there.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.639
Yeah.

09:54.870 --> 09:55.803
What you got

09:55.804 --> 09:57.135
Going on here, pops?

09:57.136 --> 09:59.337
I'm not sure.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.701
See you stopped

10:04.702 --> 10:05.637
Taking your meds.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.067
No, I'm still on 'em.

10:07.068 --> 10:09.502
Well, sort of.

10:09.503 --> 10:11.435
Doc's gonna love that answer.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.636
Well, I'm gonna

10:12.637 --> 10:13.469
Take 'em later.

10:13.470 --> 10:15.200
Make it harder to think.

10:15.201 --> 10:16.769
I need to be clear right now.

10:16.770 --> 10:18.802
What's all this?

10:18.803 --> 10:21.936
I'm having a revelation,

10:21.937 --> 10:23.099
An epiphany of some kind,

10:23.100 --> 10:23.936
But it's all coming at me

10:23.937 --> 10:25.301
So fast I can't seem

10:25.302 --> 10:26.568
To organize it.

10:26.569 --> 10:27.835
Thought research

10:27.836 --> 10:28.636
Gave you headaches.

10:28.637 --> 10:31.635
It does.

10:31.636 --> 10:32.601
Are you aware that

10:32.601 --> 10:33.536
The Dietrich ice shield

10:33.537 --> 10:34.935
Collapsed yesterday?

10:34.936 --> 10:36.100
200 Miles of

10:36.101 --> 10:38.700
Glacial coastline gone?

10:38.701 --> 10:40.767
No, pops, I'm not.

10:40.768 --> 10:42.267
Scientists projected

10:42.268 --> 10:43.301
It would take 150 years

10:43.302 --> 10:44.067
For it to melt away

10:44.068 --> 10:45.567
And it was gone in 10.

10:45.568 --> 10:47.435
There are unprecedented

10:47.436 --> 10:49.867
Hurricanes in the Atlantic.

10:49.868 --> 10:51.335
There are massive earthquakes on

10:51.336 --> 10:53.368
The cascade volcanic arc, even

10:53.369 --> 10:55.099
Worse shaking more than usual.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.834
Something's happening, son,

10:56.835 --> 10:58.934
Something bad.

10:58.935 --> 11:02.600
Dad, I know you hate them.

11:02.601 --> 11:04.000
But, I mean, your meds.

11:04.001 --> 11:06.334
Maybe they could bring

11:06.335 --> 11:07.101
A little light

11:07.102 --> 11:08.500
Into the darkness.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.500
Dad?

11:10.501 --> 11:12.533
You're patronizing me.

11:12.534 --> 11:13.599
No, I'm not, dad.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.999
Dad?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.133
Have you seen my backpack,

11:16.134 --> 11:16.934
The one that holds

11:16.934 --> 11:17.767
The sleeping bag?

11:17.768 --> 11:21.434
Hey! What are you doing here?

11:21.435 --> 11:22.400
There was an accident

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
On the site today.

11:23.401 --> 11:26.066
I'm sorry.

11:26.067 --> 11:26.966
What do you need

11:26.966 --> 11:27.834
Your backpack for?

11:27.835 --> 11:29.098
Jerrod and I are going

11:29.099 --> 11:30.732
Camping for the weekend.

11:30.733 --> 11:31.733
Mount Lincoln?

11:31.733 --> 11:32.499
Yep.

11:32.499 --> 11:33.367
Yeah, no, grace.

11:33.368 --> 11:34.565
Just give it a few days.

11:34.566 --> 11:35.334
We have no idea

11:35.334 --> 11:36.198
What happened up there.

11:36.199 --> 11:37.766
You can't be serious.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.097
I'm talking about a few days!

11:39.098 --> 11:39.999
'Til we figure out

11:39.999 --> 11:40.967
What caused the accident.

11:40.967 --> 11:41.900
I think I can handle

11:41.901 --> 11:43.899
A campout.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.164
Oh, for crying out loud, dad!

11:47.165 --> 11:49.432
Hey, can you handle that?

11:49.433 --> 11:50.765
What are you doing?

11:50.766 --> 11:51.798
We're trying to figure...

11:51.799 --> 11:52.632
You know what?

11:52.632 --> 11:53.533
Forget it.

11:53.533 --> 11:54.499
I gotta go.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.333
I appreciate the concern,

11:56.334 --> 11:57.932
But I'm 20, not 16.

11:57.933 --> 11:58.665
Then why are you acting

11:58.665 --> 11:59.467
Like you're 12?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.399
When you can follow

12:01.400 --> 12:02.334
Your own advice,

12:02.335 --> 12:03.797
Maybe I'll do the same.

12:03.798 --> 12:06.197
I gotta go.

12:09.666 --> 12:12.332
Thanks for the help, pops.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.765
I've gotta get into town.

12:13.766 --> 12:14.832
I'm way behind

12:14.833 --> 12:15.964
With Monica's books.

12:15.965 --> 12:17.731
Yeah, well, no wonder.

12:17.732 --> 12:21.963
Dad, your meds?

12:21.964 --> 12:24.031
Give me lift into town?

12:26.097 --> 12:30.131
Deal.

12:30.132 --> 12:32.132
Let's go.

12:55.764 --> 12:56.696
I'm still picking up

12:56.697 --> 12:57.863
A signal.

12:57.864 --> 12:58.764
The terrain's making it

12:58.765 --> 13:00.264
Difficult to navigate.

13:03.398 --> 13:04.596
No, that's a negative.

13:04.597 --> 13:06.397
No status of the team.

13:06.398 --> 13:07.364
Have we heard anything

13:07.364 --> 13:08.364
From the rest of them?

13:11.996 --> 13:13.928
Hold on! Hold on!

13:13.929 --> 13:14.597
I got another quake

13:14.597 --> 13:15.530
Rolling through.

13:15.531 --> 13:16.764
I'll call you back.

14:23.562 --> 14:24.429
Hi, Zoe.

14:24.430 --> 14:25.860
Hey, Professor, Thomas.

14:25.861 --> 14:26.794
Hey, Zoe.

14:26.794 --> 14:27.629
Thought I'd come by

14:27.630 --> 14:28.727
And wrap up Monica's books

14:28.728 --> 14:29.892
While she's away on holiday.

14:29.893 --> 14:31.428
I'd have come by earlier,

14:31.429 --> 14:33.328
But I got distracted.

14:33.329 --> 14:34.461
The ledger's on

14:34.462 --> 14:35.461
The desk in the back.

14:35.462 --> 14:36.527
Thanks.

14:36.528 --> 14:37.659
See you later, Thomas.

14:37.660 --> 14:38.827
See you, dad.

14:38.828 --> 14:41.927
Hey, Thomas, is your dad

14:41.928 --> 14:43.225
Doing okay?

14:43.226 --> 14:45.126
Yeah, I guess. Why?

14:45.127 --> 14:46.060
I don't know.

14:46.060 --> 14:46.861
I guess he seems

14:46.862 --> 14:49.559
A little distracted lately.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.659
Monica didn't say anything?

14:51.660 --> 14:52.361
He's not messing up?

14:52.361 --> 14:53.159
No, no, no, gosh, no, no.

14:53.159 --> 14:53.860
He's great.

14:53.861 --> 14:55.091
I mean, I know he's been

14:55.092 --> 14:55.927
Going through a rough time

14:55.928 --> 14:58.327
And everything and I guess

14:58.328 --> 14:59.759
I thought I should let you know.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.326
Thanks.

15:01.327 --> 15:03.692
You know, I really appreciate

15:03.693 --> 15:04.826
What you and Monica

15:04.827 --> 15:05.761
Have done for him,

15:05.761 --> 15:06.461
Letting him help out

15:06.461 --> 15:07.394
Around here.

15:07.395 --> 15:08.526
I know it's not much, but,

15:08.527 --> 15:10.791
I don't know, it's good for him.

15:10.792 --> 15:11.526
Keeps his mind going

15:11.526 --> 15:12.493
Since he stopped teaching.

15:12.493 --> 15:13.426
I mean, it's not charity

15:13.426 --> 15:14.327
Or anything.

15:14.328 --> 15:15.391
He figured out that tax thing.

15:15.392 --> 15:16.392
You know, who knew

15:16.392 --> 15:17.360
A classics Professor would be

15:17.361 --> 15:18.627
So good at accounting.

15:19.526 --> 15:21.492
Yeah, he's pretty good when

15:21.493 --> 15:22.327
He puts his mind to something.

15:22.327 --> 15:23.060
Yeah.

15:23.060 --> 15:23.959
Can I get you something to eat?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.225
No, I'm good.

15:25.226 --> 15:25.958
Rain check.

15:25.958 --> 15:26.626
Okay, all right.

15:26.627 --> 15:28.458
Any time. See you later.

15:31.327 --> 15:32.392
Thomas!

15:32.393 --> 15:33.891
Emily!

15:33.892 --> 15:35.990
How are you?

15:35.991 --> 15:38.025
I'm fine. How are you?

15:38.026 --> 15:40.725
Good, good, yeah.

15:40.726 --> 15:42.326
What are you doing here?

15:42.327 --> 15:43.989
Work.

15:43.990 --> 15:45.989
Work?

15:45.990 --> 15:48.056
Just doing some research,

15:48.057 --> 15:50.490
Plus couldn't pass up the chance

15:50.491 --> 15:51.724
To live it up for

15:51.725 --> 15:53.859
A couple of days in ascension.

15:56.326 --> 15:57.358
You look great.

15:57.359 --> 15:59.557
Well, thanks.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.189
So what kind of research?

16:04.190 --> 16:07.723
Oh, basically, you guys

16:07.724 --> 16:08.458
Are just shaking

16:08.459 --> 16:09.624
A little bit more than normal.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.724
Yeah, don't I know it?

16:12.725 --> 16:13.889
We had an accident today

16:13.890 --> 16:15.157
During one of the tremors.

16:15.158 --> 16:16.223
One of my crew

16:16.224 --> 16:17.089
Was actually killed.

16:17.090 --> 16:18.557
What?

16:18.558 --> 16:19.491
Yeah.

16:19.492 --> 16:22.557
Do you know Joe Enfield?

16:22.558 --> 16:23.757
No.

16:23.758 --> 16:25.790
Great guy, great friend.

16:25.791 --> 16:27.490
I'm on the way to see

16:27.491 --> 16:28.689
His family right now.

16:28.690 --> 16:30.324
I'm really sorry.

16:30.325 --> 16:32.424
If there's anything I can do...

16:32.425 --> 16:34.622
Nah, it's fine.

16:34.623 --> 16:36.356
How long you in town for?

16:36.357 --> 16:37.555
Not long.

16:37.556 --> 16:40.324
Just gonna take some readings.

16:40.325 --> 16:44.023
Maybe we can grab

16:44.024 --> 16:45.723
A bite sometime.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.389
Uh, yeah.

16:50.390 --> 16:52.456
Yeah, okay.

16:52.457 --> 16:54.923
Okay.

16:58.457 --> 17:02.889
It's good to see you.

17:02.890 --> 17:06.457
Yeah, you, too.

17:18.688 --> 17:19.623
Here's your sandwich,

17:19.623 --> 17:20.522
Professor, just the way

17:20.522 --> 17:21.388
You like it.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.324
Thanks, Zoe.

17:22.325 --> 17:24.086
Maybe there.

17:24.087 --> 17:26.886
Okay.

17:26.887 --> 17:28.488
What's this?

17:28.489 --> 17:30.054
Self-portrait?

17:30.055 --> 17:31.789
Very funny.

17:33.323 --> 17:34.855
This is a creature

17:34.856 --> 17:36.086
The Mayans believed

17:36.087 --> 17:37.355
Lurked in the underworld

17:37.356 --> 17:39.086
And would one day rise up

17:39.087 --> 17:41.321
And exact revenge on society.

17:41.322 --> 17:43.986
I mean, why would the Mayans

17:43.987 --> 17:45.321
Think your creature

17:45.322 --> 17:46.586
Would want vengeance on them?

17:46.587 --> 17:48.086
Reckoning.

17:48.087 --> 17:49.586
Well, what did they do?

17:49.587 --> 17:51.322
Every culture has

17:51.323 --> 17:53.322
Its myths of eschatology,

17:53.323 --> 17:55.053
Destruction stories,

17:55.054 --> 17:56.487
End of time scenarios.

17:56.488 --> 17:58.219
Whenever a society

17:58.220 --> 17:59.920
Has been close to destroying

17:59.921 --> 18:00.254
Its surroundings

18:00.255 --> 18:03.019
Or on the brink of destroying

18:03.020 --> 18:03.821
The very earth that

18:03.821 --> 18:04.655
Gives it life,

18:04.656 --> 18:06.120
It's always been stopped short

18:06.121 --> 18:07.353
Of annihilation by

18:07.354 --> 18:10.420
Outside forces often

18:10.421 --> 18:12.453
Beyond our comprehension.

18:12.454 --> 18:14.486
The Mayans believed it was

18:14.487 --> 18:15.519
This creature,

18:15.520 --> 18:16.853
But every culture

18:16.854 --> 18:18.820
Has its own version.

18:18.821 --> 18:21.354
Are you crazy?

18:23.554 --> 18:24.487
I'm sorry.

18:24.487 --> 18:25.153
I shouldn't have...

18:25.154 --> 18:27.621
I don't think so.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.084
I hate those.

18:41.085 --> 18:42.719
No matter how long I live here,

18:42.720 --> 18:44.619
I will never get used to them.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.886
Oh, your drawings!

18:45.887 --> 18:46.821
Oh, it's all right.

18:46.822 --> 18:48.118
Never mind, never mind.

20:20.082 --> 20:21.016
Hello?

20:21.016 --> 20:21.983
Are you getting this?

20:21.983 --> 20:22.983
Uh-huh.

20:22.984 --> 20:24.582
Something massive

20:24.583 --> 20:25.681
Happened here last night.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.948
Every box recorded it

20:26.949 --> 20:27.750
And there's nothing wrong

20:27.750 --> 20:28.582
With the sensors.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.282
Yeah. This is not good.

20:30.283 --> 20:31.448
If this thing is

20:31.449 --> 20:33.349
Becoming active, it's not doing

20:33.350 --> 20:34.382
Anything by the book.

20:34.383 --> 20:35.416
It's a complete anomaly.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.350
I know.

20:36.350 --> 20:37.249
Why don't you try and

20:37.250 --> 20:38.782
Get infrared from the satellite?

20:38.783 --> 20:39.616
Call over to your friend

20:39.616 --> 20:40.616
Who interns at the observatory.

20:40.617 --> 20:41.816
See if they can send one.

20:41.817 --> 20:42.750
There's got to be

20:42.751 --> 20:43.782
New lava tubes.

20:43.783 --> 20:44.450
The old ones will

20:44.451 --> 20:46.848
Be plugged and...

20:46.849 --> 20:48.249
And what?

20:50.516 --> 20:51.449
What would you say

20:51.449 --> 20:52.416
If I told you there were

20:52.417 --> 20:53.881
Dead squirrels at my feet?

20:53.882 --> 20:55.282
I'd tell you

20:55.283 --> 20:56.016
To watch your step.

20:56.017 --> 20:57.948
I'm serious, mansey.

20:57.949 --> 21:02.014
I'd say it sounds

21:02.015 --> 21:03.315
Like we have co2 leaking.

21:03.316 --> 21:04.747
All over the Mountain.

21:04.748 --> 21:06.316
I gotta go!

21:12.749 --> 21:14.047
All right, come on, mutts!

21:14.048 --> 21:15.315
Out you come!

21:15.316 --> 21:17.049
There you go.

21:24.915 --> 21:25.946
So this is where

21:25.947 --> 21:26.980
You were at the time?

21:26.981 --> 21:28.213
Yeah, right here.

21:28.214 --> 21:29.214
There was a tremor,

21:29.215 --> 21:30.614
Told the boys to get out

21:30.615 --> 21:34.079
Of the trees.

21:34.080 --> 21:34.881
Joe and I were looking

21:34.881 --> 21:35.780
At a piece of equipment.

21:35.781 --> 21:37.879
Then what?

21:37.880 --> 21:40.212
That branch broke off,

21:40.213 --> 21:42.045
Came down and hit Joe,

21:42.046 --> 21:43.913
But he was lucid.

21:43.914 --> 21:46.514
He was conscious.

21:46.515 --> 21:48.380
I run over to grab the truck

21:48.381 --> 21:50.178
And, by the time I got back...

21:50.179 --> 21:52.315
So where was he when...

21:53.414 --> 21:56.145
Munson? Munson?

21:56.146 --> 21:57.413
What's wrong?

21:57.414 --> 21:58.446
What's wrong, buddy?

21:58.447 --> 22:00.045
You okay?

22:00.046 --> 22:02.880
What's going on?

22:04.880 --> 22:08.546
Thomas!

22:08.547 --> 22:09.777
Stand up!

22:09.778 --> 22:10.446
Huh?

22:10.446 --> 22:11.113
Stand up right now!

22:11.113 --> 22:11.778
Pick up the dog!

22:11.778 --> 22:12.746
Pick him up!

22:12.747 --> 22:14.011
Emily?

22:14.012 --> 22:15.613
There's a cloud

22:15.614 --> 22:16.414
of CO2 hovering

22:16.414 --> 22:17.113
above the ground

22:17.113 --> 22:17.713
about three feet high.

22:17.714 --> 22:19.209
Anything inside it will suffocate.

22:19.379 --> 22:20.314
What?

22:20.315 --> 22:21.479
Carbon dioxide is

22:21.480 --> 22:23.144
leaking from the ground.

22:23.145 --> 22:24.346
You can't see it or smell it.

22:24.347 --> 22:27.677
You just drift off to sleep.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.444
That's what happened to Joe.

22:29.445 --> 22:30.211
Well, what are you

22:30.211 --> 22:30.945
Doing here?

22:30.946 --> 22:32.445
Seismic readings are double

22:32.446 --> 22:33.379
What they were at this time

22:33.379 --> 22:34.313
Last month.

22:34.314 --> 22:36.012
And then with the surface

22:36.013 --> 22:37.077
Deformations and now

22:37.078 --> 22:38.512
These co2 emissions,

22:38.513 --> 22:40.111
I don't want to be

22:40.112 --> 22:41.313
Presumptuous, but I think

22:41.314 --> 22:42.314
The Mountain is

22:42.315 --> 22:43.476
Becoming active again.

22:43.477 --> 22:45.477
Emily, I'm sure you don't

22:45.478 --> 22:46.976
Remember this, but we had much

22:46.977 --> 22:48.210
Larger tremors than this

22:48.211 --> 22:49.312
Back in '84.

22:49.313 --> 22:50.313
I have been tracking...

22:50.314 --> 22:51.445
And after all that time,

22:51.446 --> 22:52.744
The locals got scared

22:52.745 --> 22:53.446
And packed up

22:53.446 --> 22:54.313
Waiting for the worst

22:54.314 --> 22:55.944
To happen and nothing ever did.

22:55.945 --> 22:57.477
Before long, everybody

22:57.478 --> 22:58.446
Went back to normal.

22:58.447 --> 23:00.010
You can doubt me

23:00.011 --> 23:00.244
All you want,

23:00.245 --> 23:02.176
But there is co2

23:02.177 --> 23:03.577
Leaking from this whole area

23:03.578 --> 23:04.877
Like a sieve!

23:04.878 --> 23:06.110
It sounds like it already

23:06.111 --> 23:07.044
Killed a man!

23:07.045 --> 23:09.077
You have an obligation to keep

23:09.078 --> 23:10.811
People off this Mountain!

23:10.812 --> 23:11.843
Uncle Matt!

23:11.844 --> 23:13.311
So now it's Uncle Matt?

23:13.312 --> 23:16.844
You owe me one.

23:29.044 --> 23:30.411
No, that's a negative.

23:30.412 --> 23:31.312
I can't get to the site

23:31.312 --> 23:32.143
Via the main road.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.410
I need you to find me a guide,

23:33.411 --> 23:35.074
A local, somebody that knows

23:35.075 --> 23:36.075
The Mountain.

23:36.076 --> 23:37.410
I'm telling you,

23:37.411 --> 23:38.743
There is a massive amount

23:38.744 --> 23:40.141
Of movement up here.

23:40.142 --> 23:41.709
Like I said, the ground is

23:41.710 --> 23:43.443
Moving beneath the topsoil,

23:43.444 --> 23:44.609
Maybe deeper.

23:44.610 --> 23:45.943
It's forcing these fossils

23:45.944 --> 23:48.310
To the surface.

23:48.311 --> 23:52.109
Yeah, yeah, it's coming in now.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.310
Can that be right?

23:58.311 --> 23:59.641
We have a new report

23:59.642 --> 24:00.243
Published today.

24:00.244 --> 24:02.310
The effects of global warming

24:02.311 --> 24:04.008
Were made alarmingly clear

24:04.009 --> 24:05.675
By the scientific community,

24:05.676 --> 24:06.709
Although several

24:06.710 --> 24:08.542
Conservative groups still raise

24:08.543 --> 24:09.476
Concerns over

24:09.477 --> 24:10.774
Their authenticity.

24:10.775 --> 24:11.907
This despite

24:11.908 --> 24:12.940
The stunning collapse

24:12.941 --> 24:14.309
Of the Dietrich ice shelf

24:14.310 --> 24:15.841
Just days ago.

24:15.842 --> 24:17.207
More on the reaction

24:17.208 --> 24:18.941
To this accelerated phenomenon

24:18.942 --> 24:20.975
Following the station break.

24:20.976 --> 24:25.108
Grace? Have you heard this?

24:25.109 --> 24:26.940
We're annihilating ourselves

24:26.941 --> 24:28.108
And nothing's being done!

24:28.109 --> 24:29.207
Something's gonna happen!

24:29.208 --> 24:30.074
Something has to happen to stop

24:30.075 --> 24:32.173
It before we destroy the world!

24:32.174 --> 24:33.673
Dad, I just...

24:33.674 --> 24:35.107
Look at these fragments,

24:35.108 --> 24:35.942
Right?

24:35.943 --> 24:38.008
They almost piece together

24:38.009 --> 24:40.008
The awakening,

24:40.009 --> 24:41.707
The dragon's breath,

24:41.708 --> 24:43.907
Like pieces of a puzzle.

24:43.908 --> 24:45.172
I don't know what

24:45.173 --> 24:46.308
You're talking about.

24:46.309 --> 24:47.374
The world is going

24:47.375 --> 24:48.607
To push back!

24:48.608 --> 24:50.039
It always has!

24:50.040 --> 24:51.008
It's been in myth,

24:51.008 --> 24:51.708
It's been in metaphor,

24:51.708 --> 24:52.708
It's been in the stories.

24:52.708 --> 24:53.674
Dad, i...

24:53.675 --> 24:55.408
Something is coming!

24:55.409 --> 24:56.874
We have to be ready!

24:56.875 --> 24:58.072
We have to be prepared!

24:58.073 --> 25:00.240
Dad, I have to go, okay?

25:00.241 --> 25:04.006
It's like when tiamat,

25:04.007 --> 25:05.573
The embodiment of chaos,

25:05.574 --> 25:07.007
Opened her jaws

25:07.008 --> 25:08.772
To swallow marduk and

25:08.773 --> 25:10.607
Marduk fired an arrow down her

25:10.608 --> 25:11.939
Throat and into her belly.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.574
It was the only way to kill her!

25:13.575 --> 25:15.838
Split her heart in two!

25:15.839 --> 25:18.071
And tiamat was no more!

25:18.072 --> 25:22.506
Okay. Dad, I have to go,

25:22.507 --> 25:26.307
But I'll be back soon, okay?

25:26.308 --> 25:27.908
I'll be back soon.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.205
Hey.

26:21.805 --> 26:22.605
What does this look

26:22.606 --> 26:23.936
Like to you?

26:23.937 --> 26:27.869
It was my lunch.

26:27.870 --> 26:29.203
This is a satellite image

26:29.204 --> 26:30.070
Of the area

26:30.071 --> 26:33.036
Indicating thermal readings.

26:33.037 --> 26:33.838
Tell me that is not

26:33.839 --> 26:35.136
A geothermal anomaly.

26:35.137 --> 26:37.136
They have to be magma pipes.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.669
Okay, these are

26:38.670 --> 26:40.504
The epicenter locations

26:40.505 --> 26:41.937
Of the tremors three days ago,

26:41.938 --> 26:43.904
Then two, then yesterday.

26:43.905 --> 26:46.103
Looks like

26:46.104 --> 26:47.037
They're moving up the Mountain.

26:47.038 --> 26:49.203
Exactly.

26:49.204 --> 26:49.938
Think the Mountain's

26:49.938 --> 26:50.838
Waking up?

26:50.839 --> 26:52.305
I don't know.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.338
The thing is, if the Mountain

26:54.339 --> 26:55.702
Really was becoming active,

26:55.703 --> 26:57.304
It would have done it already.

26:57.305 --> 26:58.437
It would have been very large

26:58.438 --> 26:59.668
And very violent and everyone

26:59.669 --> 27:01.470
In the town would

27:01.471 --> 27:03.069
Already be dead from the blast.

27:03.070 --> 27:04.003
But we're not.

27:04.004 --> 27:06.304
Yet we're not, which just

27:06.305 --> 27:07.004
Keeps leading me

27:07.004 --> 27:07.870
To the same conclusion.

27:07.871 --> 27:09.503
This is a geothermal anomaly,

27:09.504 --> 27:12.335
Some kind of force or energy

27:12.336 --> 27:13.803
That's churning everything

27:13.804 --> 27:15.001
Up from underneath the area,

27:15.002 --> 27:17.736
Creating new lava pipes,

27:17.737 --> 27:19.036
Venting co2.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.635
Okay, and what

27:20.636 --> 27:22.003
Would cause that?

27:25.837 --> 27:27.903
You don't know and

27:27.904 --> 27:28.836
You're heading back up

27:28.837 --> 27:32.467
The Mountain to figure it out.

27:32.468 --> 27:33.601
Yeah.

27:33.602 --> 27:34.370
And you want me to go

27:34.371 --> 27:36.935
With you.

27:36.936 --> 27:37.903
No.

27:37.904 --> 27:40.602
Em?

27:40.603 --> 27:44.167
You sure?

27:44.168 --> 27:46.403
Yeah.

27:47.602 --> 27:49.534
Be careful up there.

27:49.535 --> 27:52.435
Don't push it.

27:52.436 --> 27:55.836
Yeah. I'll be fine.

28:18.668 --> 28:19.468
Watch out!

28:19.468 --> 28:20.133
You might hit something!

28:20.134 --> 28:21.768
I'm driving here.

28:26.166 --> 28:28.768
Stop!

28:32.302 --> 28:34.435
Relax.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.666
Woo!

28:45.501 --> 28:48.200
That doesn't turn me on!

29:00.233 --> 29:01.932
Stop it.

29:01.933 --> 29:03.467
What?

29:08.866 --> 29:11.865
Hey, wait!

29:21.733 --> 29:22.899
Thomas Walsh?

29:22.900 --> 29:23.965
Yeah.

29:23.966 --> 29:26.032
Hi. Jack Murray.

29:26.033 --> 29:27.299
Hi.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.631
I'm told no one

29:28.632 --> 29:29.333
Knows these mountains

29:29.334 --> 29:30.564
Better than you do.

29:30.565 --> 29:32.432
I know a little.

29:32.433 --> 29:33.366
Well, I was hoping

29:33.366 --> 29:34.366
You could help me out.

29:34.367 --> 29:35.931
I'm with a company

29:35.932 --> 29:36.963
That's looking to retrieve

29:36.964 --> 29:37.766
Some information from

29:37.767 --> 29:38.932
One of our outposts.

29:38.933 --> 29:41.832
I'm a geologist.

29:41.833 --> 29:43.130
Yeah, we had some equipment fail

29:43.131 --> 29:44.130
Near vinci Ridge

29:44.131 --> 29:45.196
At our base camp,

29:45.197 --> 29:46.298
So I'm just looking

29:46.299 --> 29:47.299
For a guide.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.898
Today's not the best day

29:49.899 --> 29:51.030
To go up that Mountain,

29:51.031 --> 29:52.063
Jack, was it?

29:52.064 --> 29:52.732
Yeah.

29:52.732 --> 29:53.531
Yeah, yeah, whatever it is,

29:53.532 --> 29:54.864
It can wait.

29:54.865 --> 29:56.097
No.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.197
Actually, I'm afraid it can't.

29:57.198 --> 29:58.798
I'm told you're ex-military.

29:58.799 --> 30:02.930
You served under hardin.

30:02.931 --> 30:06.230
I am, was, helicopter pilot,

30:06.231 --> 30:07.163
13th.

30:07.164 --> 30:08.298
Hardin's a friend of mine.

30:08.299 --> 30:09.497
I called in a favor.

30:09.498 --> 30:11.097
He directed me to you.

30:11.098 --> 30:12.064
Look, I know it is

30:12.065 --> 30:13.197
A strange request,

30:13.198 --> 30:13.930
But I need to get up

30:13.930 --> 30:14.831
That Mountain to the equipment.

30:14.832 --> 30:15.996
There's valuable

30:15.997 --> 30:18.629
Information up there.

30:18.630 --> 30:20.531
Valuable to who?

30:21.930 --> 30:22.963
Well, until I get

30:22.964 --> 30:23.663
To the equipment,

30:23.664 --> 30:24.996
I can't be certain of anything.

30:24.997 --> 30:29.730
Look, I just need a guide.

30:29.731 --> 30:30.830
You in good shape?

30:30.831 --> 30:32.629
Yeah, I think so.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.897
All right. Leave in 10.

30:37.797 --> 30:39.431
Thank you.

30:46.162 --> 30:48.330
You're quiet.

30:48.331 --> 30:50.095
I mean, I'm sorry

30:50.096 --> 30:51.228
About the off-roading.

30:51.229 --> 30:52.296
It's not that.

30:52.297 --> 30:54.296
What is it?

30:54.297 --> 30:57.562
I'm fine.

30:58.863 --> 31:00.228
No. Look, I'm sorry.

31:00.229 --> 31:02.296
I promised myself

31:02.297 --> 31:03.761
I wouldn't let it bother me.

31:03.762 --> 31:06.096
It's okay. What's going on?

31:06.097 --> 31:08.628
My family is nuts.

31:08.629 --> 31:10.660
My brother acts like my dad

31:10.661 --> 31:11.661
And my dad acts like

31:11.662 --> 31:12.894
A raving lunatic!

31:12.895 --> 31:14.296
Hey.

31:14.297 --> 31:15.428
I used to have such

31:15.429 --> 31:16.828
A normal family.

31:16.829 --> 31:18.194
There is no such thing

31:18.195 --> 31:20.061
As a normal family.

31:21.029 --> 31:21.829
Well, there's definitely

31:21.830 --> 31:23.296
Such a thing as a crazy one.

31:23.297 --> 31:24.528
Look, for the next couple

31:24.529 --> 31:26.159
Of days, it is gonna be

31:26.160 --> 31:27.627
Just you and me.

31:27.628 --> 31:31.795
No brothers, no dads, just us.

31:31.796 --> 31:33.193
Sound good?

31:33.194 --> 31:35.060
Sounds good.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.961
Good.

31:50.528 --> 31:54.561
All right, here we go.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.060
Hello?

32:02.060 --> 32:02.894
Daniel?

32:02.894 --> 32:03.595
Emily!

32:03.595 --> 32:04.327
You're not on mount Lincoln,

32:04.327 --> 32:04.994
Are you?

32:04.994 --> 32:05.827
Yeah, why?

32:05.827 --> 32:06.761
Reception is terrible.

32:06.762 --> 32:07.794
There's a lot of interference.

32:07.795 --> 32:08.960
Did you get the data

32:08.961 --> 32:09.894
I sent you?

32:09.895 --> 32:11.426
I think I got most of it,

32:11.427 --> 32:12.360
But I have some more

32:12.361 --> 32:13.527
Troubling information.

32:13.528 --> 32:14.360
What is it?

32:14.360 --> 32:15.294
There are cataclysmic reports

32:15.294 --> 32:15.926
Coming in from

32:15.926 --> 32:16.794
All over the globe.

32:16.794 --> 32:17.794
I mean, yesterday I saw

32:17.795 --> 32:19.058
Reports of tsunamis

32:19.059 --> 32:20.459
Off the coast of Indonesia

32:20.460 --> 32:21.295
While Japan was

32:21.296 --> 32:22.426
Rocked by an 8.4.

32:22.427 --> 32:23.295
I mean, there were

32:23.295 --> 32:24.159
Devastating tremors

32:24.159 --> 32:24.859
From the middle east

32:24.859 --> 32:25.827
Across Europe.

32:25.828 --> 32:27.327
What are you talking about?

32:27.328 --> 32:28.295
Something's happening.

32:28.296 --> 32:29.893
It's global.

32:29.894 --> 32:31.026
Any commonalities?

32:31.027 --> 32:32.124
I checked the lab

32:32.125 --> 32:33.025
Satellite imaging and

32:33.025 --> 32:33.859
There are strains of

32:33.859 --> 32:34.626
Heat signatures

32:34.626 --> 32:35.559
Reaching across the planet.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.124
Origination?

32:38.125 --> 32:39.992
Ascension.

32:39.993 --> 32:42.293
Okay, do you have any idea

32:42.294 --> 32:43.958
What any of this means?

32:43.959 --> 32:45.558
Well, I don't...

32:45.559 --> 32:47.058
You're breaking up.

32:47.059 --> 32:48.457
Emily?

32:48.458 --> 32:49.393
Daniel?

32:49.393 --> 32:50.158
Emily?

32:50.159 --> 32:51.592
Daniel?

33:04.526 --> 33:06.493
Oh!

33:12.459 --> 33:13.358
William, you're just

33:13.359 --> 33:14.391
Gonna have to forgive me.

33:14.392 --> 33:15.692
I'm just not following you.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.491
It's all significant!

33:18.492 --> 33:19.991
Something's happening,

33:19.992 --> 33:21.025
Something huge.

33:21.026 --> 33:21.826
What?

33:21.827 --> 33:22.923
Just what do you think it is?

33:22.924 --> 33:25.690
It's the thrashing.

33:25.691 --> 33:28.091
It's some kind of awakening.

33:28.092 --> 33:29.757
It's like a life force

33:29.758 --> 33:31.024
Breathing against itself.

33:31.025 --> 33:32.056
I'm very concerned.

33:32.057 --> 33:34.656
William, now you and I go

33:34.657 --> 33:36.156
Back a long way, right?

33:36.157 --> 33:37.757
We've certainly lived here

33:37.758 --> 33:38.591
Long enough to survive

33:38.592 --> 33:39.723
The occasional rumble.

33:39.724 --> 33:40.790
I mean, nothing's changed.

33:40.791 --> 33:42.189
But it has, sheriff.

33:42.190 --> 33:44.089
The signs are everywhere.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.391
It's all across the globe!

33:45.392 --> 33:46.190
Yeah, but that's all part

33:46.190 --> 33:47.090
Of the natural progression

33:47.090 --> 33:47.956
Of things.

33:47.956 --> 33:48.758
It has been since

33:48.758 --> 33:49.524
The dawn of man.

33:49.525 --> 33:51.155
No, not this time, sheriff!

33:51.156 --> 33:52.791
The myths are clear.

33:52.792 --> 33:55.023
From the depths of obscurity

33:55.024 --> 33:56.622
Ascends a creature with one

33:56.623 --> 33:58.290
Purpose and one purpose only.

33:58.291 --> 34:00.222
Well, what's that?

34:00.223 --> 34:03.824
To destroy civilization.

34:05.924 --> 34:07.955
Well, what about Thomas?

34:07.956 --> 34:09.190
What about grace?

34:09.190 --> 34:10.024
What about them?

34:10.025 --> 34:11.090
I'm talking about everyone.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.291
Well, I'm not!

34:12.292 --> 34:14.654
I'm talking about your family.

34:14.655 --> 34:17.022
I'm talking about your kids.

34:17.023 --> 34:18.355
With all due respect,

34:18.356 --> 34:20.121
Sheriff, you don't understand.

34:22.090 --> 34:24.290
William, listen to me

34:24.291 --> 34:26.322
And you listen to me good.

34:26.324 --> 34:27.688
Get help!

34:27.690 --> 34:29.188
Take your medication.

34:29.188 --> 34:30.554
Do whatever it is you have

34:30.554 --> 34:31.554
To do to cope with

34:31.556 --> 34:32.654
Whatever you're going through!

34:32.655 --> 34:34.187
You do it.

34:34.188 --> 34:36.289
You do it or, so help me,

34:36.290 --> 34:37.322
I'll see to it that

34:37.322 --> 34:39.755
Somebody does it for you!

35:03.954 --> 35:05.653
This really the best way?

35:05.654 --> 35:07.721
It's the only way.

35:07.722 --> 35:09.387
Right.

35:09.388 --> 35:10.554
Be careful getting

35:10.555 --> 35:11.455
Too close to the ground.

35:11.456 --> 35:13.588
Co2's leaking out everywhere.

35:13.589 --> 35:16.288
Someone told me it might be

35:16.289 --> 35:18.388
A sign the Mountain's waking up.

35:18.389 --> 35:19.820
What do you think about that?

35:19.821 --> 35:22.288
Could be.

35:22.289 --> 35:24.587
Yeah, could be.

35:24.588 --> 35:25.986
We getting close?

35:25.987 --> 35:27.388
It's a little bit further.

35:27.389 --> 35:28.686
Who'd you say

35:28.687 --> 35:31.753
You work for again?

35:31.754 --> 35:33.788
I didn't.

35:46.653 --> 35:47.820
Whoa!

35:47.821 --> 35:50.086
Uh, that's another one.

35:50.087 --> 35:52.119
I hope this isn't a bad idea.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.120
Relax.

35:53.121 --> 35:54.618
The safest place to be

35:54.619 --> 35:56.551
Is on the Mountain.

35:56.552 --> 35:57.819
My dad told me during

35:57.820 --> 35:58.619
The massive quake

35:58.620 --> 36:00.118
In '72 that half the buildings

36:00.119 --> 36:01.586
In ascension were ruined,

36:01.587 --> 36:02.985
But nothing happened

36:02.986 --> 36:04.319
To the Mountain structures.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.786
Good, because I want

36:05.787 --> 36:07.151
Tonight to be perfect.

36:07.152 --> 36:07.987
What?

36:07.988 --> 36:10.150
Huh? Uh, nothing.

36:10.151 --> 36:12.286
What are you talking about?

36:12.287 --> 36:14.452
I just want us to have

36:14.453 --> 36:16.286
A perfect weekend together.

36:16.287 --> 36:17.586
It has been way too long and

36:17.587 --> 36:20.519
We're away from your friends.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.452
Hey! Sarah and Evelyn

36:22.453 --> 36:23.551
Are my best friends.

36:23.552 --> 36:24.453
They're like family.

36:24.454 --> 36:27.952
Your non-crazy family?

36:31.586 --> 36:32.918
Hey, grace, I didn't...

36:32.919 --> 36:36.050
I know what you meant.

36:36.051 --> 36:37.684
I...

36:37.685 --> 36:38.851
Look, it's okay for me

36:38.852 --> 36:41.286
To say it, but not you.

36:41.287 --> 36:42.818
I know. You're right.

36:42.819 --> 36:43.984
Look, that might be unfair,

36:43.985 --> 36:45.351
But that's just the way it is.

36:45.352 --> 36:50.319
I'm sorry.

36:51.286 --> 36:52.117
Just no talking

36:52.117 --> 36:53.084
For 10 minutes.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.985
Deal, totally.

36:55.986 --> 36:58.752
Good job, jerrod.

37:30.684 --> 37:32.718
This is it.

37:36.284 --> 37:37.883
What the hell happened here?

37:37.884 --> 37:39.182
Don't touch anything.

37:39.183 --> 37:40.583
Gladly.

37:47.484 --> 37:48.615
What branch of the military

37:48.616 --> 37:50.449
You working for again?

37:50.450 --> 37:51.748
What?

37:51.749 --> 37:52.648
What branch of

37:52.649 --> 37:54.114
The military you working for.

37:54.115 --> 37:57.483
Said you worked under hardin.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.716
What is this?

37:58.717 --> 38:00.215
Government contracts?

38:00.216 --> 38:01.282
Black ops?

38:01.283 --> 38:02.882
You wouldn't know.

38:02.883 --> 38:03.817
Trust me.

38:03.818 --> 38:05.182
Try me.

38:08.915 --> 38:10.782
Look, Thomas, the only thing

38:10.783 --> 38:12.615
I can tell you is that

38:12.616 --> 38:13.482
We've been detecting

38:13.482 --> 38:14.283
Seismic activity

38:14.284 --> 38:15.448
On this Mountain for some time.

38:15.449 --> 38:16.283
We set up a team

38:16.284 --> 38:18.448
To investigate it.

38:18.449 --> 38:20.283
We lost contact with them.

38:20.284 --> 38:21.715
What were they looking for?

38:21.716 --> 38:24.147
These are the coordinates.

38:24.148 --> 38:25.180
To what?

38:25.181 --> 38:26.282
Thought we were looking

38:26.283 --> 38:27.283
For this place.

38:27.283 --> 38:28.283
No, that's only part of it.

38:28.284 --> 38:29.515
What I need is up there.

38:29.516 --> 38:33.113
You need to get me up there.

38:33.114 --> 38:34.514
It's about a mile from here.

38:34.515 --> 38:38.147
It's rough country.

38:44.815 --> 38:45.981
And I'm not going

38:45.982 --> 38:47.848
One step further.

38:49.114 --> 38:52.946
Thomas!

38:52.947 --> 38:55.847
Em! Are you all right?

38:55.848 --> 38:56.848
What happened?

38:56.848 --> 38:57.748
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:57.749 --> 38:59.512
Some boulders just shot out of

38:59.513 --> 39:00.214
A rock face I was near,

39:00.215 --> 39:01.745
Almost like...

39:01.746 --> 39:02.714
Where was this?

39:02.715 --> 39:03.846
Not far. Who are you?

39:03.847 --> 39:04.913
He's a geologist.

39:04.914 --> 39:07.281
Okay, look, Thomas,

39:07.282 --> 39:08.114
We need to get back

39:08.114 --> 39:08.781
To ascension.

39:08.781 --> 39:09.715
This thing is gonna blow and,

39:09.716 --> 39:10.946
When it does, it's gonna take

39:10.947 --> 39:11.947
Everything with it.

39:11.947 --> 39:12.615
All right, fine.

39:12.615 --> 39:13.282
Look, my trucks

39:13.282 --> 39:13.947
Not far from here.

39:13.947 --> 39:14.615
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:14.615 --> 39:15.313
Wait a minute!

39:15.313 --> 39:16.145
Thomas, I need you

39:16.145 --> 39:17.145
To guide me up that hill.

39:17.145 --> 39:17.913
Look, if she says

39:17.913 --> 39:18.747
It's time to clear out,

39:18.747 --> 39:19.480
That's what's happening.

39:19.481 --> 39:21.912
Fine.

39:21.913 --> 39:22.846
Tell me how to get there.

39:22.847 --> 39:24.412
Experienced hikers

39:24.413 --> 39:25.346
And climbers have trouble

39:25.346 --> 39:26.146
With that area.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.146
You're never gonna make it.

39:27.146 --> 39:27.881
Can't this wait?

39:27.882 --> 39:30.980
No! No, it can't.

39:33.112 --> 39:34.144
Travel this direction

39:34.145 --> 39:34.945
A half mile.

39:34.945 --> 39:35.679
You reach an impasse.

39:35.679 --> 39:36.480
You make it over,

39:36.481 --> 39:37.712
You'll be in the vicinity.

39:37.713 --> 39:41.678
Good luck.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.045
Come on, I'll take you down.

40:04.713 --> 40:07.510
This is it!

40:07.511 --> 40:10.744
It's here!

40:14.079 --> 40:16.779
It's here.

40:35.745 --> 40:39.043
It's okay. I'm not mad.

40:39.044 --> 40:41.109
Promise?

40:41.110 --> 40:43.279
I promise.

40:50.577 --> 40:52.977
Why are you so nervous?

40:52.978 --> 40:54.610
I'm not.

40:54.611 --> 40:58.477
So, this is the spot?

40:58.478 --> 40:59.876
Yep.

40:59.877 --> 41:00.210
I used to come here a lot

41:00.211 --> 41:02.277
When I was growing up.

41:02.278 --> 41:03.278
Yeah, you said that.

41:03.279 --> 41:04.477
It means something to you,

41:04.478 --> 41:05.443
Doesn't it?

41:05.444 --> 41:06.611
Well, minus the rain.

41:07.778 --> 41:10.742
Yeah, it does.

41:10.743 --> 41:12.409
We've been dating for,

41:12.410 --> 41:14.875
What, four years now?

41:14.876 --> 41:16.709
Yep.

41:16.710 --> 41:19.277
And we have known

41:19.278 --> 41:21.141
Each other since we were kids?

41:21.142 --> 41:22.377
The second grade.

41:22.378 --> 41:23.409
Right, when I asked you

41:23.410 --> 41:24.343
To be my girlfriend

41:24.344 --> 41:26.675
And you kicked me in the knee.

41:26.676 --> 41:28.409
Ow!

41:28.410 --> 41:29.343
Like that?

41:29.344 --> 41:30.975
Yeah, like that.

41:35.008 --> 41:36.808
I can't imagine a life

41:36.809 --> 41:39.441
Without you in it.

41:39.442 --> 41:42.942
Me neither.

41:45.141 --> 41:46.742
What are...

41:49.575 --> 41:52.841
Grace Walsh,

41:52.842 --> 41:54.876
Will you marry me?

42:03.675 --> 42:06.874
That wasn't there before.

42:10.542 --> 42:14.542
Was that there before?

42:33.174 --> 42:35.276
What?

42:42.308 --> 42:45.606
Hey!

42:45.607 --> 42:47.540
What?

42:55.974 --> 42:57.938
Let's get outta here!

42:57.939 --> 42:59.874
Run, run, run, run, run!

43:14.738 --> 43:15.804
Uncle Matt!

43:15.805 --> 43:17.273
Emily, you okay?

43:17.274 --> 43:19.638
Look, Uncle, it's worse

43:19.639 --> 43:20.938
Than I thought, much worse.

43:20.939 --> 43:21.873
I know.

43:21.873 --> 43:22.707
I got all that from before.

43:22.708 --> 43:23.938
I'm closing down the Mountain

43:23.939 --> 43:24.971
To the general public.

43:24.972 --> 43:25.939
That's a good start,

43:25.940 --> 43:27.072
But it's not nearly good enough.

43:27.073 --> 43:27.971
I need you

43:27.971 --> 43:28.904
To evacuate the county.

43:28.905 --> 43:30.537
Excuse me?

43:30.538 --> 43:31.506
Between the readings

43:31.506 --> 43:32.406
We've gathered up there

43:32.406 --> 43:33.273
And the ground

43:33.273 --> 43:34.038
Temperature increasing,

43:34.038 --> 43:34.973
You know as well as I do

43:34.974 --> 43:36.170
This is way outside

43:36.171 --> 43:36.938
The ordinary.

43:36.938 --> 43:37.638
Well, out of

43:37.638 --> 43:38.538
The ordinary, sure.

43:38.539 --> 43:40.171
But come on, evacuate?

43:40.172 --> 43:41.405
There are fissures opening up

43:41.406 --> 43:42.772
All over the Mountain!

43:42.773 --> 43:44.670
Emily, when you lump it

43:44.671 --> 43:45.904
All together like this,

43:45.905 --> 43:47.070
I know how it sounds.

43:47.071 --> 43:48.936
But all this can be explained.

43:48.937 --> 43:49.838
Uncle Matt!

43:49.838 --> 43:50.705
In 1984...

43:50.706 --> 43:54.170
This is not '84!

43:54.171 --> 43:56.103
She's right, sheriff.

43:56.104 --> 43:59.070
The whole area's unsafe.

43:59.071 --> 44:01.270
Soil we found up there

44:01.271 --> 44:02.503
Was littered with hot pumice

44:02.504 --> 44:03.438
And ash.

44:03.438 --> 44:04.437
The material on mount Lincoln

44:04.437 --> 44:05.405
Is known to have interlay

44:05.406 --> 44:06.737
Deep within its soil,

44:06.738 --> 44:07.936
Which means it

44:07.937 --> 44:08.937
Is being forced up

44:08.938 --> 44:09.672
From underground.

44:09.673 --> 44:10.903
Emily, it's...

44:10.904 --> 44:12.704
Days, days before

44:12.705 --> 44:14.037
Mount St. helens blew,

44:14.038 --> 44:14.904
Seismic activity

44:14.905 --> 44:16.037
Was half of what

44:16.038 --> 44:17.336
We're recording right now.

44:17.337 --> 44:18.170
Ground temperatures

44:18.170 --> 44:19.103
Were lower and there were

44:19.104 --> 44:21.703
No gaseous emissions!

44:21.704 --> 44:23.336
So what do you suggest?

44:23.337 --> 44:25.336
Get everyone out

44:25.337 --> 44:26.635
At least 10 to 20 Miles away.

44:26.636 --> 44:27.636
20 Miles!

44:27.637 --> 44:29.304
Give us a window to see what

44:29.305 --> 44:31.003
Mount Lincoln has in store!

44:31.004 --> 44:32.669
And if nothing happens,

44:32.670 --> 44:33.504
What then?

44:33.505 --> 44:34.635
Then at least

44:34.636 --> 44:35.902
We've taken precautions.

44:35.903 --> 44:38.034
But if it does blow,

44:38.035 --> 44:39.035
And I think it will,

44:39.036 --> 44:41.101
You'll have saved

44:41.102 --> 44:43.135
Hundreds of lives.

44:53.303 --> 44:54.469
All right,

44:54.470 --> 44:56.168
I'll make the call.

44:56.169 --> 44:57.303
Thank you, thank you!

44:57.304 --> 44:58.271
But I truly hope that

44:58.272 --> 45:00.202
You are wrong about this.

45:00.203 --> 45:03.868
Me, too.

45:03.869 --> 45:06.035
What the hell was that?

45:06.036 --> 45:06.869
I don't know.

45:06.870 --> 45:08.001
It was alive!

45:08.002 --> 45:08.702
Let's just get to

45:08.702 --> 45:09.402
The bottom of the Mountain.

45:09.403 --> 45:10.800
A giant eye or something!

45:10.801 --> 45:12.503
Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

45:55.469 --> 45:58.701
Hello? Hello?

45:58.702 --> 46:00.199
This is agent Murray.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.267
Can you hear me?

46:02.268 --> 46:03.667
Affirmative. Proceed.

46:03.668 --> 46:05.432
I've salvaged the flash drive

46:05.433 --> 46:06.967
From the remains of site 14.

46:06.968 --> 46:08.933
The information on

46:08.934 --> 46:10.167
The drive is correct.

46:10.168 --> 46:11.433
The team discovered

46:11.434 --> 46:13.434
The epicenter of the entity

46:13.435 --> 46:15.965
And we are running out of time.

46:15.966 --> 46:17.165
Conclusion?

46:17.166 --> 46:17.933
We're facing

46:17.934 --> 46:20.665
A singularity event.

46:20.666 --> 46:22.732
I repeat, we are facing

46:22.733 --> 46:25.467
A singularity event.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.632
What was that?

46:36.632 --> 46:37.566
What?

46:37.567 --> 46:38.598
Did you hear something?

46:38.599 --> 46:41.332
No.

46:41.333 --> 46:42.333
It's nothing.

46:42.334 --> 46:44.165
I thought I heard...

46:44.166 --> 46:46.932
What the hell is that?

46:50.400 --> 46:51.630
I don't know.

46:51.631 --> 46:52.731
Where's that smoke

46:52.732 --> 46:53.865
Coming from?

46:53.866 --> 46:54.665
There must be something

46:54.666 --> 46:55.698
That think pushed up

46:55.699 --> 46:56.731
From under the ground.

46:56.732 --> 46:59.865
It's huge!

46:59.866 --> 47:01.265
I don't know.

47:01.266 --> 47:02.066
It looked like it

47:02.067 --> 47:03.399
Just pushed it up.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.699
Do you think it's inside?

47:04.700 --> 47:05.832
Jerrod! Jerrod!

47:05.833 --> 47:07.798
Huh? What?

47:10.266 --> 47:11.931
Just stay close.

47:11.932 --> 47:13.031
I don't wanna

47:13.032 --> 47:14.164
Be here anymore.

47:14.165 --> 47:14.965
I know, I know.

47:14.966 --> 47:16.999
I know you don't.

47:18.831 --> 47:23.265
Hey, I am not gonna

47:23.266 --> 47:24.697
Let anything happen to you,

47:24.698 --> 47:25.530
But the only way that

47:25.531 --> 47:26.764
We are gonna get out of this

47:26.765 --> 47:27.765
Is that we make it down

47:27.766 --> 47:29.029
And we stay calm, okay?

47:29.030 --> 47:30.431
Okay, okay.

47:30.432 --> 47:31.829
It's gonna be fine,

47:31.830 --> 47:33.265
It's gonna be fine.

47:33.266 --> 47:35.597
Let's just get outta here.

47:35.598 --> 47:37.631
Hold my hand.

47:39.964 --> 47:40.664
Are you okay?

47:40.664 --> 47:41.398
Yeah, I'm fine. You?

47:41.398 --> 47:42.063
Yeah.

47:42.063 --> 47:42.865
Okay.

47:42.866 --> 47:44.028
Let's get outta here!

47:44.029 --> 47:45.597
Keep moving!

47:53.430 --> 47:54.130
All right, ladies and

47:54.130 --> 47:54.930
Gentlemen, if I could have

47:54.931 --> 47:56.963
Your attention, please?

47:56.964 --> 47:59.696
We have to evacuate the town.

47:59.697 --> 48:00.197
I'm hereby ordering you

48:00.198 --> 48:02.463
To evacuate to at least

48:02.464 --> 48:04.829
20 Miles outside of ascension.

48:04.830 --> 48:07.429
Now I know that we've had

48:07.430 --> 48:09.396
Drills like this before.

48:09.397 --> 48:10.763
We've had some tremblers

48:10.764 --> 48:12.564
And rumblers, but this one,

48:12.565 --> 48:14.894
Although it is not immediate,

48:14.895 --> 48:16.028
It is imminent

48:16.029 --> 48:16.764
And we're gonna ask

48:16.764 --> 48:17.697
You to leave town.

48:17.698 --> 48:18.961
So I want you go home right now,

48:18.962 --> 48:21.296
Get your kids, your valuables,

48:21.297 --> 48:23.429
Your pets, get in the car

48:23.430 --> 48:24.863
And get out of town

48:24.864 --> 48:26.730
As soon as possible.

48:31.962 --> 48:33.263
Thomas, Thomas,

48:33.264 --> 48:34.162
It's happening.

48:34.162 --> 48:35.028
Dad, dad, dad.

48:35.028 --> 48:35.763
Now's not the time.

48:35.764 --> 48:36.862
Look, we gotta leave, all right?

48:36.863 --> 48:37.796
They're evacuating the town,

48:37.796 --> 48:38.595
So get to the truck.

48:38.595 --> 48:39.297
We're leaving.

48:39.297 --> 48:40.095
What about grace?

48:40.095 --> 48:40.763
Well, we're gonna get her

48:40.764 --> 48:41.862
At the house.

48:41.863 --> 48:42.662
She's not there.

48:42.662 --> 48:43.596
She's already gone.

48:43.597 --> 48:48.993
Oh no.

48:48.994 --> 48:50.295
She's gone up the Mountain.

48:50.296 --> 48:52.328
Now? Why would she do that?

48:52.329 --> 48:53.061
'Cause she has no idea

48:53.062 --> 48:56.262
All this is going on.

48:56.263 --> 48:57.263
All right, I gotta go up

48:57.263 --> 48:58.027
And get her.

48:58.028 --> 48:59.661
Well, she could be anywhere.

48:59.662 --> 49:00.195
No, she'll be

49:00.196 --> 49:01.795
At Hudson clearing.

49:01.796 --> 49:02.696
It's where she's been going

49:02.696 --> 49:03.663
Since she was a kid.

49:03.663 --> 49:04.562
Well, can we call her?

49:04.563 --> 49:05.827
There's no reception.

49:05.828 --> 49:06.661
All right, dad, listen.

49:06.661 --> 49:07.595
This is important, all right?

49:07.596 --> 49:09.126
I need you go to down

49:09.127 --> 49:10.427
To Olympia, all right?

49:10.428 --> 49:11.362
Go to aunt Evelyn's house

49:11.363 --> 49:12.594
And wait there 'til we get back.

49:12.595 --> 49:13.960
Thomas...

49:13.961 --> 49:14.928
No, dad, dad!

49:14.928 --> 49:15.928
This is not up for discussion.

49:15.928 --> 49:16.827
I'm gonna go with you.

49:16.827 --> 49:17.661
What? No!

49:17.662 --> 49:18.826
I'm gonna go with you!

49:18.827 --> 49:20.526
You sure?

49:20.527 --> 49:22.025
Yeah.

49:22.026 --> 49:24.527
All right. Get your gear.

49:26.795 --> 49:31.694
Thomas, I want you

49:31.695 --> 49:32.894
To take this.

49:32.895 --> 49:33.661
Now dad...

49:33.662 --> 49:34.694
Your mother gave this

49:34.695 --> 49:36.560
To me years ago to protect me.

49:36.561 --> 49:37.394
You should keep it.

49:37.394 --> 49:38.261
It's a sacred piece

49:38.262 --> 49:39.625
From the puyallup tribe.

49:39.626 --> 49:41.693
I want you to take it.

49:41.694 --> 49:42.925
Dad, you keep it.

49:42.926 --> 49:43.761
Come on.

49:43.762 --> 49:46.425
Thomas, please?

49:46.426 --> 49:50.261
Just wear it for me?

49:50.262 --> 49:51.262
All right,

49:51.263 --> 49:53.860
All right, dad, fine.

49:53.861 --> 49:57.260
Olympia, aunt Evelyn's, please?

49:57.261 --> 49:58.293
Got it.

49:58.294 --> 50:00.025
All right.

50:16.926 --> 50:18.225
What's going on?

50:18.226 --> 50:18.993
What is this?

50:18.993 --> 50:19.726
Sheriff is evacuating

50:19.726 --> 50:20.426
The town.

50:20.426 --> 50:21.360
Evacuating?

50:21.361 --> 50:22.658
Where am I supposed to go?

50:22.659 --> 50:23.692
You can come with me.

50:23.693 --> 50:24.824
We'll figure the rest later.

50:24.825 --> 50:25.958
Professor, this is crazy!

50:25.959 --> 50:27.426
Zoe, we have to go now!

50:27.427 --> 50:28.426
Grab your things!

50:28.426 --> 50:29.260
But hold on a second.

50:29.261 --> 50:30.890
I gotta do something.

50:30.891 --> 50:32.624
Zoe?

50:45.090 --> 50:46.324
How far away is the clearing?

50:46.325 --> 50:47.758
A little bit further.

50:47.759 --> 50:50.891
What the hell was she thinking?

50:50.892 --> 50:51.725
She's young.

50:51.725 --> 50:52.424
She probably just wanted

50:52.424 --> 50:53.292
To get away.

50:53.293 --> 50:55.157
Away from what?

50:55.158 --> 50:55.924
Her understanding

50:55.925 --> 50:59.590
Older brother?

50:59.591 --> 51:00.192
You went away, too,

51:00.193 --> 51:02.258
If you don't remember.

51:02.259 --> 51:03.259
Yeah, well, military

51:03.260 --> 51:04.391
Was my only option.

51:04.392 --> 51:05.259
Well, grace was

51:05.260 --> 51:06.423
Still really young.

51:06.424 --> 51:07.558
She had to grow up faster

51:07.559 --> 51:09.023
Than you, faster than all of us.

51:09.024 --> 51:12.057
I know your dad

51:12.058 --> 51:17.424
Probably can't be much help.

51:17.425 --> 51:18.258
Well, he still has

51:18.259 --> 51:19.723
Plenty of good days.

51:19.724 --> 51:23.822
Just never got over losing mom.

51:23.823 --> 51:26.022
Deep down, I'm sure

51:26.023 --> 51:26.957
She's scared to death

51:26.958 --> 51:28.889
To see him this way.

51:28.890 --> 51:31.723
Yeah, well, I don't

51:31.724 --> 51:33.357
Really understand it either.

51:33.358 --> 51:35.257
I mean, I understand loss.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.323
I understand grief.

51:36.324 --> 51:39.457
I just... I don't know.

51:39.458 --> 51:40.489
Seems like he can't handle

51:40.490 --> 51:41.689
Reality, so he creates

51:41.690 --> 51:43.257
This world that he can live in

51:43.258 --> 51:45.021
And control.

51:45.022 --> 51:47.055
I don't know.

51:47.056 --> 51:48.522
Is that why you left?

51:48.523 --> 51:52.822
No.

51:52.823 --> 51:57.421
Well, maybe, I don't know.

51:57.422 --> 51:59.322
We had planned

51:59.323 --> 52:01.922
To go away together,

52:01.923 --> 52:03.657
Remember?

52:06.656 --> 52:07.557
Sometimes things

52:07.557 --> 52:08.258
Just don't work out

52:08.259 --> 52:09.756
The way you planned.

52:29.087 --> 52:30.688
Hello?

52:30.689 --> 52:31.655
Do you hear that?

52:31.656 --> 52:33.388
Yeah, yeah. This way.

52:33.389 --> 52:36.054
Hello?

52:38.154 --> 52:40.321
Jack?

52:40.322 --> 52:42.586
What happened?

52:42.587 --> 52:43.687
I busted up my leg

52:43.688 --> 52:44.887
On the impasse.

52:44.888 --> 52:45.954
Told you it was a bitch.

52:45.955 --> 52:46.888
Yeah.

52:46.889 --> 52:47.919
Think it's broken?

52:47.920 --> 52:49.255
No, I don't think so.

52:49.256 --> 52:50.321
Can you stand?

52:50.322 --> 52:53.086
Yeah. Oh!

52:53.087 --> 52:54.520
You got it?

52:54.521 --> 52:56.019
Yeah, I think so.

52:56.020 --> 52:57.321
You need to get back

52:57.322 --> 52:58.120
Down the hill.

52:58.121 --> 52:59.486
Sheriff's evacuating

52:59.487 --> 53:00.187
The whole county.

53:00.188 --> 53:01.654
No, I can't.

53:01.655 --> 53:03.118
What are you guys

53:03.119 --> 53:04.153
Doing back here?

53:04.154 --> 53:06.853
Looking for my sister.

53:06.854 --> 53:07.755
You need to get to

53:07.756 --> 53:08.786
A hospital.

53:08.787 --> 53:10.719
I need that case.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.754
Jack, you can barely walk.

53:12.755 --> 53:13.819
Thomas, you know what

53:13.820 --> 53:15.319
It's like to follow orders.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.254
Do what you're told

53:16.255 --> 53:17.553
In order to save lives.

53:17.554 --> 53:18.853
That is the situation I'm in.

53:18.854 --> 53:20.286
I need that case!

53:20.287 --> 53:21.054
What is so special

53:21.054 --> 53:22.019
About this case?

53:22.020 --> 53:23.085
Em?

53:23.086 --> 53:24.054
All right, look,

53:24.055 --> 53:25.853
We're headed that direction.

53:25.854 --> 53:27.686
If you can keep up and,

53:27.687 --> 53:28.753
If we pass by it,

53:28.754 --> 53:29.885
We'll grab it, but that's it.

53:29.886 --> 53:30.854
No, no!

53:30.855 --> 53:32.085
We need to get grace and get

53:32.086 --> 53:33.052
The hell off this Mountain,

53:33.053 --> 53:34.518
Not chase down equipment!

53:34.519 --> 53:36.718
What is this about?

53:36.719 --> 53:39.118
I'm not sure.

53:41.853 --> 53:44.152
It's coming from ascension.

53:49.254 --> 53:50.718
Zoe, I cannot stress

53:50.719 --> 53:51.652
The urgency of

53:51.652 --> 53:52.652
This situation enough!

53:52.652 --> 53:53.518
We have to go!

53:53.519 --> 53:54.651
I can't just leave this here.

53:54.652 --> 53:55.818
It's my responsibility.

53:55.819 --> 53:56.917
It doesn't matter!

53:56.918 --> 53:59.386
We have to go now!

54:08.685 --> 54:11.253
Professor?

54:17.353 --> 54:19.918
Run! Run!

54:56.982 --> 54:57.851
It's not just

54:57.852 --> 54:58.883
A piece of equipment.

54:58.884 --> 54:59.784
Well, what is it then?

54:59.784 --> 55:00.183
That's the million

55:00.184 --> 55:02.081
Dollar question.

55:02.082 --> 55:02.817
What's the government

55:02.817 --> 55:03.616
Doing up here?

55:03.617 --> 55:05.583
You don't wanna know.

55:05.584 --> 55:06.982
Well, why are you up here

55:06.983 --> 55:08.149
For geothermal anomalies

55:08.150 --> 55:09.416
Or is it something else?

55:09.417 --> 55:10.449
Something you're doing up here?

55:10.450 --> 55:12.050
Jack, you asked for our help.

55:12.051 --> 55:12.850
Fill us in.

55:12.851 --> 55:15.251
Why are you up here?

55:27.015 --> 55:30.914
Okay.

55:30.915 --> 55:32.782
Six months ago, my office

55:32.783 --> 55:33.815
Recorded a subsonic boom

55:33.816 --> 55:35.249
In the pacific ocean.

55:35.250 --> 55:36.481
Russian, Japanese,

55:36.482 --> 55:37.316
American subs,

55:37.317 --> 55:38.882
They all picked it up.

55:38.883 --> 55:40.081
Exactly the same time

55:40.082 --> 55:41.249
A similar sound was heard

55:41.250 --> 55:42.949
At eight different locations

55:42.950 --> 55:46.250
Across the globe.

55:46.251 --> 55:47.613
The strongest source was

55:47.614 --> 55:49.413
Traced back here specifically

55:49.414 --> 55:51.681
A mile below mount Lincoln.

55:51.682 --> 55:54.147
Why didn't we hear it?

55:54.148 --> 55:55.249
It was completely

55:55.250 --> 55:56.481
Subterranean.

55:56.482 --> 55:57.748
It's like we felt it and

55:57.749 --> 55:59.349
Never even acknowledged it.

55:59.350 --> 56:00.182
We picked up a spike in

56:00.183 --> 56:02.249
About six months ago,

56:02.250 --> 56:03.015
But we recorded it

56:03.016 --> 56:04.347
As a sensor glitch.

56:04.348 --> 56:05.249
We picked up the same

56:05.250 --> 56:06.314
Glitch a few days ago.

56:06.315 --> 56:08.112
It wasn't a glitch.

56:08.113 --> 56:09.248
Every one of my teams

56:09.249 --> 56:12.248
Recorded the same thing.

56:12.249 --> 56:14.514
Then why weren't we warned?

56:14.515 --> 56:15.748
About what, Thomas?

56:15.749 --> 56:18.313
A big boom?

56:18.314 --> 56:20.248
We sent a team to investigate

56:20.249 --> 56:24.313
And gather information.

56:24.314 --> 56:25.646
They were trying to confirm

56:25.647 --> 56:26.680
The possibility of

56:26.681 --> 56:27.980
A singularity event.

56:27.981 --> 56:29.012
What the hell is

56:29.013 --> 56:30.047
A singularity?

56:30.048 --> 56:31.780
A singularity is an event

56:31.781 --> 56:32.912
That can single-handedly change

56:32.913 --> 56:33.947
The course of life

56:33.948 --> 56:34.781
As we know it.

56:34.782 --> 56:35.847
A volcano?

56:35.848 --> 56:36.880
No, not quite.

56:36.881 --> 56:39.111
We believe that an event

56:39.112 --> 56:40.247
Of this magnitude

56:40.248 --> 56:41.447
Occurred 30,000 years ago

56:41.448 --> 56:43.713
And again 15,000 years ago.

56:43.714 --> 56:44.480
We believe it's gonna

56:44.481 --> 56:46.380
Happen again right here.

56:46.381 --> 56:49.247
This case is...

56:49.248 --> 56:51.814
I need this case.

57:30.578 --> 57:32.246
Come on.

57:40.478 --> 57:41.412
You okay?

57:41.412 --> 57:42.313
What the hell was that?

57:42.313 --> 57:42.978
I have no idea.

57:42.978 --> 57:43.779
Let's get the hell outta here!

57:43.779 --> 57:44.479
Where's Jack?

57:44.480 --> 57:47.578
Where's Jack?

57:50.144 --> 57:51.976
Jack! Jack!

57:51.977 --> 57:54.109
He's barely breathing.

57:54.110 --> 57:55.745
Listen to me.

57:55.746 --> 57:57.878
You got to get the case.

57:57.879 --> 58:01.377
You got to get the case.

58:01.378 --> 58:03.277
It's a weapon inside,

58:03.278 --> 58:07.578
The only thing that can stop...

58:14.511 --> 58:15.876
Jack!

58:15.877 --> 58:18.010
He's gone.

58:23.910 --> 58:25.309
All right, Jack.

58:25.310 --> 58:27.245
Come on, let's go.

58:35.445 --> 58:36.676
Hey! Hey, you okay?

58:36.677 --> 58:37.810
You okay?

58:40.476 --> 58:42.243
I don't wanna die.

58:42.244 --> 58:43.076
Hey, we have come too far

58:43.077 --> 58:44.508
To lose each other now, okay?

58:44.509 --> 58:46.776
My dad was right.

58:46.777 --> 58:48.642
He told me that a monster

58:48.643 --> 58:50.244
Was gonna destroy the world.

58:50.245 --> 58:51.943
All along he was telling me

58:51.944 --> 58:53.443
That something was coming,

58:53.444 --> 58:54.708
But I thought he was crazy,

58:54.709 --> 58:56.675
So I left and I didn't listen.

58:56.676 --> 58:58.742
All we have to do

58:58.743 --> 58:59.942
Is just find a way out

58:59.943 --> 59:00.176
Of here as soon

59:00.177 --> 59:01.742
As possible, okay?

59:01.743 --> 59:03.975
I know.

59:11.708 --> 59:14.107
Come on.

59:23.277 --> 59:25.243
Oh, my God, are you okay?

59:25.244 --> 59:27.873
Yeah. Are you?

59:27.874 --> 59:28.708
Are you all right?

59:28.708 --> 59:29.641
Oh, I think so.

59:29.641 --> 59:30.607
What's happening?

59:30.608 --> 59:32.242
I think we've fallen

59:32.243 --> 59:33.243
Into a sinkhole.

59:33.244 --> 59:34.741
We're buried underground?

59:34.742 --> 59:35.941
Looks like it.

59:35.942 --> 59:37.242
Well, how far down are we?

59:37.243 --> 59:38.243
I mean, what caused this?

59:38.243 --> 59:39.243
I'm not sure.

59:39.243 --> 59:40.243
Well, we gotta get

59:40.243 --> 59:41.007
Out of here!

59:41.007 --> 59:41.676
We have to get out!

59:41.676 --> 59:42.376
Zoe, Zoe!

59:42.376 --> 59:43.106
You have to be calm.

59:43.106 --> 59:43.874
You have to stay calm.

59:43.875 --> 59:45.072
Calm? We're trapped!

59:45.073 --> 59:45.973
Zoe, Zoe!

59:45.973 --> 59:46.708
You have to be...

59:46.708 --> 59:47.607
I need your help.

59:47.608 --> 59:48.640
You have to be strong.

59:48.641 --> 59:49.407
Okay.

59:49.408 --> 59:51.308
Okay.

59:52.842 --> 59:53.641
Take cover!

59:53.641 --> 59:54.407
Oh, God,

59:54.407 --> 59:55.275
It's happening again!

59:55.276 --> 59:57.441
No! It's just an aftershock!

59:57.442 --> 59:58.774
No! It's collapsing on us!

59:58.775 --> 59:59.606
No, no!

59:59.606 --> 01:00:00.174
The diner's intact.

01:00:00.175 --> 01:00:04.674
The diner's intact, Zoe.

01:00:07.574 --> 01:00:08.973
We have to find

01:00:08.974 --> 01:00:11.206
A way out of here.

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:15.805
My cell!

01:00:15.806 --> 01:00:16.839
There's no signal.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.805
How can there be no signal?

01:00:17.805 --> 01:00:18.774
Zoe, stay calm.

01:00:18.774 --> 01:00:19.474
No, no, no!

01:00:19.474 --> 01:00:20.207
We've gotta stay calm.

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.372
We'll find a way out of here.

01:00:21.373 --> 01:00:23.340
I'll go check the back.

01:00:23.341 --> 01:00:24.207
You check the back.

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:25.328
I'm gonna check the windows.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.306
Oh, my God!

01:00:37.307 --> 01:00:38.971
It's here.

01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:41.274
No! What is that?

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.471
There it is.

01:01:27.472 --> 01:01:28.637
All right, I gotta go down

01:01:28.638 --> 01:01:29.304
And get it.

01:01:29.304 --> 01:01:30.003
No. We gotta get grace

01:01:30.003 --> 01:01:30.904
And get outta here

01:01:30.904 --> 01:01:31.638
Or we're not gonna make it!

01:01:31.638 --> 01:01:32.538
What if Jack was right?

01:01:32.538 --> 01:01:33.471
Even more reason

01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:34.305
To get moving!

01:01:34.305 --> 01:01:35.239
What if that's the only thing

01:01:35.239 --> 01:01:36.003
That can stop it?

01:01:36.003 --> 01:01:36.872
It doesn't matter!

01:01:36.873 --> 01:01:39.038
What if it does?

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.238
I was right!

01:01:47.239 --> 01:01:48.070
I knew it would come!

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.238
Professor,

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.703
You're freaking me out.

01:01:50.704 --> 01:01:51.537
I knew something

01:01:51.537 --> 01:01:52.305
Was happening.

01:01:52.305 --> 01:01:53.103
I just didn't expect it

01:01:53.104 --> 01:01:54.771
To happen right under our feet.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:06.237
What are you doing?

01:02:06.238 --> 01:02:07.602
I think it's gone now.

01:02:07.603 --> 01:02:08.769
Its displacement was what

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:11.238
Caused the diner to collapse.

01:02:40.237 --> 01:02:44.669
Wasn't so hard, was it?

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:48.802
All right.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.634
You ready?

01:02:53.635 --> 01:02:58.068
One, two, three!

01:03:00.169 --> 01:03:01.700
No!

01:03:01.701 --> 01:03:02.868
We can't stop it,

01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:03.736
But we can buy some time.

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:04.668
Tape for the cracks

01:03:04.668 --> 01:03:05.467
In the windows?

01:03:05.467 --> 01:03:06.236
Yes, yes, yes!

01:03:06.237 --> 01:03:07.267
Get some duct tape!

01:03:07.268 --> 01:03:08.401
Quickly! Come on!

01:03:08.402 --> 01:03:10.699
Here, you tear off pieces

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.799
And I'll put them on.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.502
Okay, okay. Here.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.799
In myth, it was called

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.800
The dragon's breath,

01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:21.667
But science has identified

01:03:21.668 --> 01:03:24.834
It as carbon dioxide.

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.033
Myth and reality

01:03:26.034 --> 01:03:28.566
Have become one.

01:03:28.567 --> 01:03:29.734
Couple more pieces

01:03:29.735 --> 01:03:31.634
And we've got it.

01:03:34.235 --> 01:03:37.633
Just, um...

01:03:37.634 --> 01:03:39.965
Zoe? Zoe! No, Zoe! Zoe!

01:03:39.966 --> 01:03:42.234
Stand up, stand up and stay away

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.033
From the windows.

01:03:43.033 --> 01:03:43.700
You have to stay away

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.400
From the ground.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.066
Professor, what are

01:03:45.066 --> 01:03:45.934
You talking about?

01:03:45.935 --> 01:03:47.399
Zoe, you have to concentrate.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.032
It's carbon dioxide.

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:51.032
It's invisible and it's heavier

01:03:51.033 --> 01:03:52.667
Than air and it's deadly

01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:53.933
And it's seeping

01:03:53.934 --> 01:03:54.834
Through the windows.

01:03:54.835 --> 01:03:56.064
If we don't be careful,

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.266
We'll suffocate.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:58.299
I mean, do you think

01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.032
That's gonna hold?

01:03:59.032 --> 01:03:59.867
I don't...

01:03:59.867 --> 01:04:00.166
Yes, yes, for now,

01:04:00.167 --> 01:04:01.899
But we have to find a way

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.734
Out of here quickly.

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.298
How?

01:04:10.299 --> 01:04:13.399
I'll find us a way.

01:04:20.932 --> 01:04:23.234
Okay.

01:04:25.234 --> 01:04:28.466
All right.

01:04:28.467 --> 01:04:32.798
Just a little bit further.

01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:35.898
One, two...

01:04:37.398 --> 01:04:38.698
Oh, got it!

01:04:38.699 --> 01:04:40.832
Good job, em.

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:43.865
Just get back up here.

01:04:43.866 --> 01:04:45.397
Let's get

01:04:45.398 --> 01:04:47.698
The hell out of here!

01:04:51.665 --> 01:04:54.697
No!

01:04:54.698 --> 01:04:57.299
Thomas? No!

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:06.497
Are you okay?

01:05:06.498 --> 01:05:08.095
Yeah.

01:05:08.096 --> 01:05:09.964
Hurry!

01:05:19.064 --> 01:05:21.063
Hurry.

01:05:30.232 --> 01:05:31.232
Now I know why

01:05:31.232 --> 01:05:31.930
They call this place

01:05:31.931 --> 01:05:33.864
The climber's graveyard.

01:05:45.697 --> 01:05:47.630
Let's go.

01:05:54.529 --> 01:05:56.561
It's hopeless.

01:05:56.562 --> 01:05:58.994
Everything's blocked.

01:05:58.995 --> 01:06:00.163
We'll find a way out.

01:06:05.663 --> 01:06:06.894
We're gonna die down here.

01:06:06.895 --> 01:06:09.629
No, Zoe, no, we won't.

01:06:14.861 --> 01:06:16.093
When my wife died,

01:06:16.094 --> 01:06:19.229
I just shut down.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:21.093
I couldn't teach,

01:06:21.094 --> 01:06:22.993
I couldn't do anything.

01:06:22.994 --> 01:06:23.994
All I could think of

01:06:23.995 --> 01:06:26.028
Was fate and destiny.

01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:28.427
I did all that research

01:06:28.428 --> 01:06:30.228
On ancient myths

01:06:30.229 --> 01:06:32.861
And folklore trying to find

01:06:32.862 --> 01:06:34.593
A meaning for it all.

01:06:34.594 --> 01:06:37.861
We were trapped inside that car.

01:06:37.862 --> 01:06:40.761
She died right beside me.

01:06:40.762 --> 01:06:41.695
There was nothing

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:42.960
I could do to save her.

01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:48.527
I had to find out why.

01:06:48.528 --> 01:06:51.228
Sometimes...

01:06:51.229 --> 01:06:52.093
Just sometimes

01:06:52.094 --> 01:06:53.892
There's a second chance.

01:06:53.893 --> 01:06:56.927
Do you understand me, Zoe?

01:06:56.928 --> 01:07:00.160
I understand, yeah.

01:07:03.327 --> 01:07:04.793
Watch your step.

01:07:04.794 --> 01:07:07.360
Stay to the side.

01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:09.661
Will everything be okay?

01:07:13.427 --> 01:07:15.328
Be careful.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.027
Oh, God.

01:07:22.027 --> 01:07:24.760
Jerrod, hold on!

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.227
Help!

01:07:29.228 --> 01:07:33.726
Jerrod, hold on, please!

01:07:33.727 --> 01:07:37.826
Oh, God.

01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:40.491
Jerrod, hold on, please!

01:07:40.492 --> 01:07:42.558
Hold on!

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.293
Please!

01:07:50.491 --> 01:07:52.826
Jerrod!

01:07:57.227 --> 01:07:59.826
No!

01:08:02.691 --> 01:08:06.325
Jerrod!

01:08:06.326 --> 01:08:09.626
Help!

01:08:16.925 --> 01:08:19.392
Jerrod!

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:31.425
Help! Please, help.

01:08:36.558 --> 01:08:38.259
Thomas!

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:50.825
I got you!

01:08:53.624 --> 01:08:54.790
Let's go.

01:08:54.791 --> 01:08:57.024
Come on, let's go.

01:08:59.456 --> 01:09:01.223
Let's go, let's go, go!

01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:03.224
What the hell was that?

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:04.656
I have no idea,

01:09:04.657 --> 01:09:05.456
But let's get the hell

01:09:05.457 --> 01:09:07.225
Out of here!

01:09:11.124 --> 01:09:12.024
It's no use.

01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:14.224
The back is jammed tight.

01:09:14.225 --> 01:09:15.122
I don't understand

01:09:15.124 --> 01:09:18.287
Why this is happening.

01:09:18.288 --> 01:09:19.224
The world is tipped

01:09:19.225 --> 01:09:24.223
Too far in one direction.

01:09:24.224 --> 01:09:25.224
The great flood, the plague,

01:09:25.225 --> 01:09:27.223
Disease, famine,

01:09:27.224 --> 01:09:29.023
They're all modern forms

01:09:29.024 --> 01:09:29.957
Of the world keeping itself

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:31.023
In balance.

01:09:31.024 --> 01:09:32.688
Sometimes the damage

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:33.721
Is so severe it takes

01:09:33.723 --> 01:09:35.654
A force so...

01:09:35.656 --> 01:09:37.654
So dominant that mankind

01:09:37.656 --> 01:09:39.822
Simply has to pay attention.

01:09:39.823 --> 01:09:43.755
A behemoth so foreboding that

01:09:43.756 --> 01:09:47.654
The only way to stop it is...

01:09:47.656 --> 01:09:49.287
What are you saying?

01:09:49.288 --> 01:09:50.087
This is a creature that has

01:09:50.087 --> 01:09:52.421
Existed before history,

01:09:52.423 --> 01:09:53.621
Before time,

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.688
Risen from its slumber

01:09:55.689 --> 01:09:58.355
When the world is at its worst,

01:09:58.356 --> 01:10:03.587
On the brink of annihilation.

01:10:03.588 --> 01:10:06.586
It's as if we're in the belly

01:10:06.587 --> 01:10:08.554
Of the whale and

01:10:08.555 --> 01:10:09.555
The only way out

01:10:09.556 --> 01:10:12.388
Is to go through.

01:10:14.488 --> 01:10:16.121
There is a way out!

01:10:16.122 --> 01:10:17.853
Oh, my God, the hatch!

01:10:17.854 --> 01:10:19.486
You found it!

01:10:19.487 --> 01:10:20.422
We can climb through that

01:10:20.423 --> 01:10:23.020
And get to the top of the diner!

01:10:23.021 --> 01:10:24.786
Oh, let's get a ladder!

01:10:33.053 --> 01:10:35.721
Jerrod, no!

01:10:35.722 --> 01:10:39.386
Come on.

01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:42.553
I'm so sorry,

01:10:42.554 --> 01:10:43.686
Sweetheart, I am.

01:10:43.687 --> 01:10:46.052
He asked me to marry him.

01:10:46.053 --> 01:10:46.986
We were gonna

01:10:46.987 --> 01:10:48.720
Be together always!

01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:51.452
I know, I know.

01:10:51.453 --> 01:10:52.952
But listen to me,

01:10:52.953 --> 01:10:54.420
You gotta stay with me, okay?

01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:55.288
We have got to get

01:10:55.288 --> 01:10:56.119
Off this Mountain.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.220
Can you do that?

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:00.153
Okay.

01:11:00.154 --> 01:11:05.586
All right. Okay.

01:11:09.521 --> 01:11:10.885
This is a sat-nav map

01:11:10.886 --> 01:11:12.220
Of mount Lincoln.

01:11:12.221 --> 01:11:13.584
This heat signature must be

01:11:13.585 --> 01:11:14.751
The creature.

01:11:14.752 --> 01:11:15.918
It's all of mount Lincoln.

01:11:15.919 --> 01:11:18.051
Where are we supposed to go?

01:11:18.052 --> 01:11:19.452
We're gonna go down

01:11:19.453 --> 01:11:20.453
The Southern Ridge.

01:11:20.454 --> 01:11:22.051
We'll hook up with the lockman

01:11:22.052 --> 01:11:23.484
Trail and be able to get over

01:11:23.485 --> 01:11:24.485
To the ranger station.

01:11:24.485 --> 01:11:25.453
Why there?

01:11:25.453 --> 01:11:26.386
Forest services uses it

01:11:26.387 --> 01:11:27.618
As a spot-fire landing zone.

01:11:27.619 --> 01:11:29.083
Should be a helicopter.

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:30.451
Well, what if there isn't?

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.684
There will be.

01:11:31.685 --> 01:11:32.452
Shouldn't we

01:11:32.452 --> 01:11:33.385
Just hike it down?

01:11:33.385 --> 01:11:34.286
You really want to hike

01:11:34.287 --> 01:11:35.484
Back down through that mess?

01:11:35.485 --> 01:11:36.485
No.

01:11:36.485 --> 01:11:37.485
We're gonna get away

01:11:37.486 --> 01:11:39.652
From this creature, okay?

01:11:39.653 --> 01:11:41.084
All right.

01:11:43.686 --> 01:11:45.219
All right, come on, let's go,

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.584
Let's go.

01:11:55.719 --> 01:11:56.983
There!

01:11:56.984 --> 01:12:00.151
Okay, okay, yeah.

01:12:00.152 --> 01:12:03.316
Come on.

01:12:03.317 --> 01:12:04.983
Careful.

01:12:04.984 --> 01:12:07.218
Stay calm now.

01:12:07.219 --> 01:12:08.650
Now you go up first.

01:12:08.651 --> 01:12:09.651
I'll help you up and

01:12:09.652 --> 01:12:10.682
Then you pull me up after.

01:12:10.683 --> 01:12:11.385
No, wait.

01:12:11.385 --> 01:12:12.051
There's no way

01:12:12.051 --> 01:12:12.750
I can lift you up.

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:13.519
You have to go up first

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.983
And then pull me up.

01:12:14.984 --> 01:12:17.385
Okay.

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:34.382
You got it!

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:35.917
Come on, Zoe, come on.

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.016
Come on.

01:13:30.548 --> 01:13:32.716
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:40.648
Ah!

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.515
Zoe! Zoe!

01:13:44.748 --> 01:13:46.648
Zoe!

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:49.315
Zoe.

01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:54.614
Keep going, keep going!

01:13:57.947 --> 01:14:00.014
Keep going, come on!

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.747
The Mountain!

01:14:10.215 --> 01:14:11.647
Come on, let's go!

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:13.079
Come on!

01:14:14.215 --> 01:14:16.014
Focus!

01:14:23.846 --> 01:14:26.214
Zoe? Zoe!

01:14:26.215 --> 01:14:26.979
Zoe, I have to get you

01:14:26.979 --> 01:14:27.947
Out of here!

01:14:27.948 --> 01:14:30.713
Zoe!

01:14:30.714 --> 01:14:31.714
Please, sweetheart,

01:14:31.715 --> 01:14:33.414
Come on, come on.

01:14:33.415 --> 01:14:35.478
Come on.

01:14:35.479 --> 01:14:38.378
Let me pull you.

01:14:38.379 --> 01:14:39.478
That's it.

01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:41.379
Lift you up, come on.

01:14:45.479 --> 01:14:47.877
Zoe?

01:14:47.878 --> 01:14:48.780
Come on, come on!

01:14:48.781 --> 01:14:51.043
I need you to open your eyes.

01:14:51.044 --> 01:14:52.511
Just stay with me.

01:14:52.512 --> 01:14:54.212
Zoe, Zoe, open your eyes.

01:14:54.213 --> 01:14:55.213
Open your eyes.

01:14:55.213 --> 01:14:56.111
Are you all right?

01:14:56.112 --> 01:14:57.544
All right, let's see.

01:14:57.545 --> 01:14:59.377
Come on.

01:14:59.378 --> 01:15:02.479
Oh, thank heaven.

01:15:05.445 --> 01:15:07.877
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:15:19.213 --> 01:15:20.678
It's the size

01:15:20.679 --> 01:15:21.944
Of the Mountain!

01:15:21.945 --> 01:15:23.212
It is the Mountain.

01:15:23.213 --> 01:15:24.213
It's everywhere!

01:15:24.213 --> 01:15:24.844
All we got to do is get

01:15:24.845 --> 01:15:26.477
To the ranger station.

01:15:33.611 --> 01:15:34.811
Look out!

01:15:34.812 --> 01:15:36.212
Get down!

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:48.211
Em!

01:15:48.212 --> 01:15:49.777
Over here! Hurry!

01:15:57.745 --> 01:15:59.509
Let's go, lets go, let's go!

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:00.143
If we can get

01:16:00.144 --> 01:16:01.610
I can get us out of here!

01:16:01.611 --> 01:16:02.776
Let's go! Come on!

01:16:02.777 --> 01:16:04.575
We're running out of air.

01:16:04.576 --> 01:16:06.543
Co2 is filling up the room.

01:16:06.544 --> 01:16:07.710
Here.

01:16:07.711 --> 01:16:08.943
I'm so tired.

01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:10.010
That's all right.

01:16:10.011 --> 01:16:12.309
Stay with me.

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:16.074
There. There we go.

01:16:16.075 --> 01:16:17.210
Up you go first.

01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:18.211
It's gonna come back again.

01:16:18.212 --> 01:16:19.442
Just be quick, just be quick.

01:16:19.443 --> 01:16:21.443
Careful now, careful.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:22.509
That's it, that's it.

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.108
Keep going, keep going.

01:16:24.109 --> 01:16:25.210
Good, good. Well done.

01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:29.108
> Almost there.

01:16:29.109 --> 01:16:31.108
There's a lip there.

01:16:31.109 --> 01:16:31.774
Reach then...

01:16:31.774 --> 01:16:32.643
I've got it!

01:16:32.644 --> 01:16:37.409
Good, good, okay.

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:39.875
Nice job, Zoe.

01:16:44.609 --> 01:16:46.974
Okay, okay, Professor.

01:16:46.975 --> 01:16:48.209
Come grab my hand.

01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:49.873
You're almost there.

01:16:49.874 --> 01:16:51.940
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.310
Grab my hand.

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.675
No, Professor!

01:16:59.709 --> 01:17:01.574
Professor Walsh!

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:03.841
Professor!

01:17:03.842 --> 01:17:05.073
Professor Walsh!

01:17:05.074 --> 01:17:08.008
Are you okay?

01:17:12.008 --> 01:17:14.108
Professor?

01:17:15.774 --> 01:17:17.708
Professor!

01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:21.074
Professor Walsh!

01:17:23.308 --> 01:17:24.308
Please, Professor,

01:17:24.309 --> 01:17:27.272
We have to get out of here!

01:17:27.273 --> 01:17:27.973
Come on, Professor.

01:17:27.974 --> 01:17:30.741
Stand up! Stand up!

01:17:35.107 --> 01:17:36.274
I'm right here.

01:17:36.275 --> 01:17:37.209
I'll pull you up.

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:38.373
Here! Hurry!

01:17:38.374 --> 01:17:40.208
Come on up!

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:45.208
Go! Go!

01:17:58.207 --> 01:17:59.672
Look, I gotta figure out

01:17:59.673 --> 01:18:00.140
How to fire this weapon.

01:18:00.141 --> 01:18:01.839
Get the chopper started,

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.507
All right?

01:18:02.507 --> 01:18:03.340
I don't know how!

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:04.107
How many times

01:18:04.107 --> 01:18:04.773
I take you flying?

01:18:04.774 --> 01:18:06.207
A long time ago!

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:08.239
Turn on the battery switch,

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.506
Turn on the fuel switch,

01:18:09.507 --> 01:18:12.207
Hit start, introduce fuel,

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:13.938
Stay with her!

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.070
Check the intake.

01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:17.038
Okay.

01:18:24.207 --> 01:18:25.406
Okay.

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:34.905
All right, buddy,

01:18:34.906 --> 01:18:37.471
I got a treat for you.

01:18:41.871 --> 01:18:42.905
Oh, please be simple,

01:18:42.906 --> 01:18:45.671
Please be simple.

01:18:45.672 --> 01:18:47.869
You gotta be kidding.

01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:49.239
Battery.

01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:55.706
Come on!

01:19:03.437 --> 01:19:05.803
Fuel valve.

01:19:05.804 --> 01:19:07.771
Oh, come on, come on!

01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:17.206
Here we go.

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:22.870
Come on.

01:19:43.637 --> 01:19:45.237
Got it!

01:19:49.103 --> 01:19:51.904
Great! Let's go!

01:19:56.803 --> 01:19:58.067
It's prepped!

01:19:58.068 --> 01:19:59.101
All right.

01:19:59.102 --> 01:19:59.968
It's not exactly

01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:03.869
Ideal conditions.

01:20:11.503 --> 01:20:13.668
Look out!

01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:19.502
You all right?

01:20:19.503 --> 01:20:21.135
Yeah.

01:20:23.169 --> 01:20:25.767
Professor, come on!

01:20:25.768 --> 01:20:26.535
Just a little bit further.

01:20:26.536 --> 01:20:27.966
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:27.967 --> 01:20:29.333
I'm right here.

01:20:29.334 --> 01:20:31.002
Come on up.

01:20:33.403 --> 01:20:35.567
Come on, I got you.

01:20:43.169 --> 01:20:45.268
Professor!

01:20:57.134 --> 01:20:58.067
Thomas, shoot it!

01:20:58.067 --> 01:20:58.768
Shoot it where?

01:20:58.769 --> 01:21:00.135
Anywhere!

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:06.400
We got one shot!

01:21:06.401 --> 01:21:09.300
I don't know where to shoot it.

01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:11.201
It was the only way

01:21:11.202 --> 01:21:12.101
To kill her!

01:21:12.102 --> 01:21:15.367
Fired an arrow down her throat,

01:21:15.368 --> 01:21:17.400
Split her heart in two!

01:21:17.401 --> 01:21:18.865
That's it!

01:21:18.866 --> 01:21:20.064
That's what dad

01:21:20.065 --> 01:21:21.065
Was talking about!

01:21:21.065 --> 01:21:21.866
What? What?

01:21:21.867 --> 01:21:22.898
He told me how to shoot it!

01:21:22.899 --> 01:21:23.832
He told me how

01:21:23.833 --> 01:21:24.833
To shoot the creature!

01:21:24.833 --> 01:21:25.533
What? What is it?

01:21:25.533 --> 01:21:26.201
What?

01:21:26.201 --> 01:21:26.867
What are you talking about?

01:21:26.867 --> 01:21:27.533
He told me

01:21:27.533 --> 01:21:28.201
Where to shoot the creature.

01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:28.867
He was talking about

01:21:28.867 --> 01:21:29.801
A Marduk or something!

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.532
No, no!

01:21:31.533 --> 01:21:32.466
It was Tiamat!

01:21:32.467 --> 01:21:34.300
Tiamat, the embodiment of chaos!

01:21:34.301 --> 01:21:35.632
Tiamat opened up its jaws

01:21:35.633 --> 01:21:36.765
Around the Marduk

01:21:36.766 --> 01:21:38.299
And then it shot an arrow

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.464
Down his throat into his belly

01:21:39.465 --> 01:21:41.200
And split its heart in two.

01:21:41.201 --> 01:21:41.999
What does that mean?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.498
It split its heart in two!

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:47.633
Shoot it in the mouth.

01:22:00.132 --> 01:22:02.064
Oh, hell,

01:22:02.065 --> 01:22:04.031
Looks like a mouth to me.

01:22:15.099 --> 01:22:17.233
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:23:26.596 --> 01:23:28.529
You did it!

01:24:15.961 --> 01:24:18.027
Dad!

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:24.826
We made it!

01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:26.527
We made it!

01:24:31.495 --> 01:24:33.695
Daddy!

01:24:35.094 --> 01:24:37.328
Angel!

01:24:40.559 --> 01:24:41.726
I'm so glad

01:24:41.727 --> 01:24:42.660
You guys are okay.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:45.194
Told you I wasn't crazy.

01:24:45.195 --> 01:24:48.727
Well, not about this.

01:24:52.494 --> 01:24:54.426
You did it, son.

01:24:54.427 --> 01:24:56.726
We did it.

01:25:00.126 --> 01:25:03.526
Oh, dad.

01:25:11.293 --> 01:25:12.459
So?

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.657
So?

01:25:13.658 --> 01:25:14.791
You want to hang out

01:25:14.792 --> 01:25:16.993
In ascension for a little while?

01:25:34.425 --> 01:25:35.293
Yeah, it was good

01:25:35.294 --> 01:25:38.292
To see you again.

01:25:38.293 --> 01:25:40.293
Let's get out of here.
