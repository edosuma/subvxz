00:04.400 --> 00:06.300
Geoffrey, have you seen Will?

00:06.400 --> 00:10.900
Master William sits in his room
sadly staring out of the window, madam...

00:11.000 --> 00:13.200
quiet as a church mouse.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.900
Hasn't spoken a word for hours.
What a shame.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.000
Poor homesick baby.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.900
I have an idea. If Will is that homesick,
let's send him home.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.000
All he's been talking about is Philadelphia.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.600
I hope these
Philadelphia cheese steaks cheer him up.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.900
I don't know what you and Will see
in those vile concoctions.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Which is why you only ate five of them?

00:41.100 --> 00:45.000
Will, we know you're homesick,
so we got you something to cheer you up.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.400
Thanks.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.300
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.300
What is it?

00:53.400 --> 00:57.700
It's a sandwich composed of cheese,
steak, and a <i>croissant de boulanger...</i>

00:57.800 --> 01:00.200
from the CafÃ© Antoinette in Beverly Hills.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.400
It's a Philadelphia cheese steak, Will.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.800
Nice try, Uncle Phil,
but this is not a Philadelphia cheese steak.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.900
See, look at the bag. No grease stain.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.900
If this were authentic, you could see
right through the bag by now.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.600
I'm sorry you don't like it.
I'll dispose of it later.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.400
- I'll throw it out.
- I'll dispose of it, Ashley.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.000
You know where you get
the best cheese steaks in Philly?

01:29.100 --> 01:31.400
Pat's Steaks on Passyunk Avenue.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.000
Me and my buddy Ice Tray used
to go there every Friday.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.400
We used to steal...

01:37.300 --> 01:39.900
I mean, we would enjoy them there often.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.900
Ice Tray? Isn't he the one
you're always talking about?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.900
Did I ever tell you about the story
in the middle of the winter?

01:47.000 --> 01:51.900
Ice Tray grabbed onto the back of a bus
and it was so cold, his face got stuck.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.700
And he was dragged around the city.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.400
He couldn't get off till he hit a bump
on the Ben Franklin Bridge.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.700
That's a story we can all relate to.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.500
Cut it out, Philip. He misses his friend.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.000
Ice Tray's more like my big brother,
though.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.300
I've got a good idea. Why don't we fly him
out for a weekend visit?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.800
You mean it, Aunt Viv?
I'm down with that.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.500
Word up. This is gonna be cold stupid
on the serious tip.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.000
What did you say, young lady?

02:20.100 --> 02:23.700
I said that this is
quite an exceptional idea, Daddy.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.600
Peachy-keen, even. Later, my man.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.000
Wonderful. First Will, now Ashley.
I can't wait till Ice Box gets here.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.100
No, it's Ice Tray, Uncle Phil.

02:37.100 --> 02:42.100
Ice Tray. I apologize.
Ice Box would be an idiotic name.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.500
Yeah, it would.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.800
Aunt Viv, this is going to be great.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.800
I can't wait to show him
all the strange sights of L.A.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.900
I don't even know where to begin.
I'll take him to Disneyland, to Marineland...

02:57.200 --> 03:00.600
- Dad, I need $200.
- I'll take him to Hilaryland.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.400
- Why do you need $200, Hilary?
- For books. I'm changing my major.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.500
- To what?
- Communications.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.500
Exactly what does that entail?

03:10.800 --> 03:14.800
You know, it's like communications.

03:14.900 --> 03:18.600
It's, like, the study of communicating,
okay?

03:21.200 --> 03:24.300
- Why do you want to major in that?
- Because I'm good at it.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074

04:44.200 --> 04:48.100
So I presume this is
the official Ice Tray greeting party.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.600
- Tray!
- Prince! Homey, get in there.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.400
Guys, you're going to hurt each other.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.200
That's okay, Vivian.
Let's see where this goes.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.900
Ice Tray, we didn't hear you come in.
Geoffrey, did you leave the door open?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.300
- Well, no.
- I guess we must have left it unlocked.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.700
"Well, no."

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You still got it, man.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.800
Hi, I'm Vivian, Will's aunt.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.600
Will, why don't you introduce Ice Tray
to your family?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.700
I'm sorry. This is my little cousin Ashley.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.800
- Hi.
- This is my bodyguard, Geoffrey.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.100
All of this is my Uncle Phil.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.900
Remember we used to say that Daffy Duck
must have a little brother somewhere?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.800
Meet my cousin Carlton.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.600
Can't touch this.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.300
Geoffrey, would you take
Ice Tray's luggage to his room?

06:04.400 --> 06:05.700
Certainly, madam.

06:05.700 --> 06:09.300
So you're also
a disadvantaged inner-city youth, I hear.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.100
- Yo, man, what's with him?
- It's a tan.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.600
- What up on the schoolyard?
- School, man.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.800
- I don't bother it, and it don't bother me.
- You don't go to school, Ice Tray?

06:24.900 --> 06:28.700
Sure I do. I've been held back
in the 10th grade three times in a row.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.700
Three times?

06:30.700 --> 06:34.900
See, my motto is,
when I find a grade I like, I stick with it.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.200
Education is the mortar
that builds the temple of success.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.600
- That's what I personally think.
- Like who cares?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.900
What's up with Smooth, Jocko,
and O-Money?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.300
Smooth and Jocko got their own
singing group now.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.900
And O-Money got his hair cut
to look like the Chrysler Building.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.700
That's good, though, man.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.100
That Mount Rushmore thing
was not working.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.200
This is dope, man.

07:06.300 --> 07:10.000
I'll just kick back here for a few days,
let somebody else do all the work.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.800
Excuse me, young man. In this house,
everyone carries his own weight.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.700
Too easy.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.500
Come on, Daddy. Tray's on vacation.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.400
See, my motto is...

07:25.500 --> 07:29.600
Lord, if there's anything like work
around my heart, please remove it.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.400
I smell something greasy.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.800
Too easy.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.400
A cheese steak! This is the real deal.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.800
Yo, man. Could I get $100?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.900
- For what?
- To pay the limo dude.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.600
You took a limo?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.700
Prince said y'all was loaded,
and when in Rome, do as.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.800
- $100?
- I got a cash flow problem.

08:02.100 --> 08:05.800
You see, my Korean Gucci bags,
they just ain't been moving lately.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.000
Tray, let's pay the dude.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.000
What's up with the Blake sisters,
they still live on 43rd St.?

08:12.100 --> 08:14.600
Yeah, man,
they got their own 900 number now.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.500
He's some piece of work.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.300
We're getting a rottweiler.

08:25.700 --> 08:30.200
I know he seems rough around the edges
but we should all give him a chance.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.299
When you really look at it,
how different is Ice Tray from Carlton?

08:34.500 --> 08:39.400
With all due respect, Mom, I think
he's a little fonder of the 10th grade than I.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.800
Hold up. What about that one girl
you went out with...

08:51.900 --> 08:53.100
that Latiqua?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.400
Man, that girl was ugly.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.700
- Ugly? You crazy, man.
- She was so ugly, she was oogly.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.400
She was so ugly,
Freddy Krueger had nightmares about her.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.000
At least she was smart.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.100
- That girl you was with...
- Stacy.

09:12.500 --> 09:16.200
That girl was so dumb,
it took her an hour to cook Minute Rice.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.900
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about skinny girls.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.500
- Who's skinny?
- That Julie you went out with?

09:24.200 --> 09:27.700
She was so skinny,
you could tie a rope around her head...

09:27.800 --> 09:29.900
and use her like a tetherball pole.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.000
Hold it. Back to Stacy.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.300
Stacy was so dumb.
Do you know how dumb Stacy was?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.600
- How dumb was Stacy?
- Stacy was so dumb...

09:39.600 --> 09:42.300
that she took the Pepsi Challenge
and chose Jif.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
This is dope, man.

09:47.700 --> 09:52.500
Look at this. Crystal, china dolls, a book.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.700
You know people are rich when they got
all this stuff they got no use for.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.100
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

10:02.600 --> 10:05.300
That's just some tired old book
Carlton's reading.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.900
Really? "From the library
of Master William Smith."

10:09.000 --> 10:11.300
Who's tired now, homey?

10:11.400 --> 10:14.900
They're forcing us to read that at school.
I ain't gonna read it.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.900
Wait. This is your handwriting.
"Intriguing duality?"

10:23.500 --> 10:25.200
Same old Prince, man.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.200
When I first met you,
you was carrying books in a pizza box...

10:28.200 --> 10:29.700
so nobody knew you were studying.

10:29.700 --> 10:33.300
That was cool, till them guys jumped me,
trying to steal my pizza.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.200
Yo, they was upset.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.800
You got a good deal here, homey.
Don't blow it.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.700
- I'll go grab us some cheese steaks.
- All right.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
Hi.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.300
Hi.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.400
Vivian, I think you're blowing
this whole thing out of proportion.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.600
Tell me the story again.
And this time, just the facts.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.200
I'll give you a transcript, Philip.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.500
Tray: "Hi." Hilary: "Hi."

11:34.200 --> 11:37.000
I don't get it.
What could she possibly see in him?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
He's got a nice smile, and cool hair.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.500
Hair? I thought it was a hat.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.600
I think I should have gotten
a larger tattoo, Tray.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.800
Tattoo?

11:53.100 --> 11:55.500
- I got a tattoo of Tray's initials.
- Where?

11:55.600 --> 11:58.600
Don't worry, Mrs. Banks.
No one will ever see it.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.500
I'm gonna go put this stuff
up in my bedroom.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.400
- I'll go with you.
- So will I.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.500
Aunt Viv, you got to be proud of yourself.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.300
Pride doesn't quite capture it, Will.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.900
It was your idea to bring Tray out here.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.800
Hilary used to walk around all the time
with such a sour look on her face.

12:19.800 --> 12:24.800
I used to say to myself,
she just needs one good friend.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.700
He does seem like
an interesting young man.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.500
You've only seen one side of him.
He's joking around, but he can be serious.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.600
Really?

12:37.600 --> 12:41.300
Seriously. If somebody's chasing him,
he can jack a fence like that.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.400
But if somebody catch him,
it don't matter.

12:44.500 --> 12:48.100
The boy got a crazy rabbit punch,
like you don't even see it coming.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.700
You out of there.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.800
Let's go check out that swimming pool,
Prince.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.400
- See you later, babe.
- Okay, Icy.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.900
It's nice to see you and Ice Tray
getting along.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.600
I'm sorry he couldn't stay longer.

13:11.700 --> 13:16.600
Don't worry, I've got it all figured out.
He can come visit every other weekend.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.800
When the 10th grade lets out,
he can come stay in the pool house.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.200
Daddy can get him a job at the office.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.900
What job could he have in the law firm?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.700
I don't know. Lawyer?

13:30.700 --> 13:35.100
Anyways, Mom, don't worry.
This is our problem, not yours.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.000
The only thing I want to say is thank you.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.900
For what?

13:42.600 --> 13:45.600
You, like, saw right past
his rough-tough exterior...

13:45.700 --> 13:47.800
and you welcomed him into our home.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.000
I'm so proud of you, Mom.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.600
I just want to share my joy with you.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.300
I haven't been this happy
since I bought my Giorgio Armani suit.

14:08.200 --> 14:12.800
This is serious.
Hilary wants him to live in our pool house.

14:12.900 --> 14:16.800
That shouldn't matter to you, Vivian.
You're the one who invited Ashtray.

14:18.100 --> 14:21.700
In fact, why don't we invite some more
of Will's friends out?

14:21.700 --> 14:26.400
Let's just put a big neon sign out in front
of the house that says "Homeboy Hotel."

14:29.100 --> 14:31.600
That's it. I want him out of this house.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.000
You're making the classic mistake.
Don't you know that?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.900
I have the perfect solution
for dealing with Mr. Ice Pick.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.600
- You do?
- My street savvy...

14:46.100 --> 14:48.000
should not be taken lightly.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.600
- She's rebelling against us.
- So?

14:51.700 --> 14:54.700
So any hostility
will only drive her closer to him.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.000
We have to embrace him,
welcome him into the family...

14:58.100 --> 15:01.700
take him out for a nice meal,
smother him with acceptance.

15:01.700 --> 15:06.400
Once the element of rebellion is gone,
the relationship will lose its appeal.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
- What if that doesn't work?
- It'll work.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.300
You two make such a lovely, lovely couple.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.800
Dad, has Mom been drinking?

15:21.500 --> 15:22.700
Nonsense, Carlton.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.500
She's just being polite
to our lovely houseguest.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
Have you been drinking?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
Tray, check this.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.900
- That's dope, man.
- Let me see.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.300
Nice catch, lady.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.700
Oh, God, Tray, you are so funny.
Isn't he funny, everyone?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.200
Not to me. Of course, I'm sober.

15:56.300 --> 16:00.000
I think escargots all around for starters.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.100
- Snails.
- Oh, no.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.600
I don't eat nothing that leaves a trail.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.700
God, Tray, you slay me.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.500
He busts me up.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.400
Before we get started,
I'd like to propose a toast.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.900
Tray, since this is your last night here...

16:25.200 --> 16:28.600
Vivian and I would just like to say
that we're both extremely happy...

16:28.700 --> 16:33.200
that Hilary's found that special someone,
that special love.

16:35.300 --> 16:39.600
I can just see Hilary and Tray in their tiny
little love nest in Philadelphia...

16:40.900 --> 16:43.300
with the pitter-patter
of five little Ice Cubes.

16:47.500 --> 16:51.000
Hilary changing diapers
and preparing a lovely meal...

16:51.600 --> 16:55.600
while her loving husband
is working his night job on the corner...

16:55.600 --> 16:58.000
as a Korean Gucci bag representative.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.400
Hilary, this is for those wonderful years
in Philadelphia.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.900
I guess I'll be driving home tonight.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.300
I am so happy.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.000
Dad, are you saying
that you wouldn't mind...

17:16.099 --> 17:18.099
if Tray and I, like, got married?

17:18.200 --> 17:20.500
Mind?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.099
- Did you hear that, Vivian?
- Mind?

17:29.600 --> 17:33.000
That's good, because Hilary and I
got married this afternoon.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.300
Hilary, no!

17:38.500 --> 17:42.200
How could you do this to us?
How could you be so stupid?

17:42.200 --> 17:46.200
Do you realize you've gone and ruined
your life? This boy doesn't care...

17:47.300 --> 17:49.200
Mom, take it down 1,000.

17:49.300 --> 17:52.500
It's only a joke. We didn't get married.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.800
We just wanted to see what you'd do.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.600
See, baby, I told you they'd flip.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.300
Homey, order me three steaks and a salad.
Come on, baby. Let's dance.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.100
Got married.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.200
Sir, Master Tray's all packed
and ready to depart.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.400
Excellent, Geoffrey.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.400
Let's afford him everything we can
in getting him on his way.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.300
Shall I call for a car, sir,
or just shoot him out of a cannon?

18:39.100 --> 18:42.500
So, that really is a wonderful restaurant,
isn't it?

18:43.100 --> 18:44.100
Yeah.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.700
I think everybody had a good time,
don't you?

18:52.500 --> 18:55.100
I really enjoyed meeting Ice Tray
this weekend.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.800
Any time you want to invite any
of your other friends, just let us know.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.700
- You enjoyed it?
- Yeah, a lot.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.600
Wasn't Hilary falling in love
with Tray just the icing on the cake?

19:06.700 --> 19:09.300
- I'm glad they had fun together.
- Me, too.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.400
It's just a shame he had to leave
before he had a chance to ruin her life.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.300
- I'm sorry I said that, it's just that...
- But you meant it.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.500
It was cool as long as Tray was
some clown to come out here...

19:19.600 --> 19:21.900
and bring me some cheese steaks
and cheer me up.

19:21.900 --> 19:25.600
Hold on. The second you found out
Hilary liked him, you wanted him out.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.000
That's something I'd expect
from Uncle Phil, not from you, Aunt Viv.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.500
- Hilary is my daughter, Will.
- And Tray is my best friend.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.000
We grew up together.
We're from the same neighborhood.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.400
We're the same person.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.300
If Tray's not good enough for this family,
then maybe I'm not.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.700
- You are not the same person.
- I know who I am.

19:41.700 --> 19:45.000
No, you listen to me.
I can see why you like Ice Tray.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.800
He's a lot of fun.
Everything's a joke to him.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.700
School, work, people.
He doesn't care about anything.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.000
He always managed to care about me.

19:53.500 --> 19:57.000
I'm glad he's a good friend,
but that doesn't change who he is.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.500
I'm sorry, but a young man his age
should be able to do something else...

20:00.600 --> 20:02.200
besides fight and jump fences.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.100
- You weren't there.
- I know, but still...

20:04.200 --> 20:07.500
When I was in seventh grade,
trying to bring books home from school...

20:07.500 --> 20:11.000
the kids would jump me,
so Tray started walking me home.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.500
If he hadn't been there to throw those
punches and help me jump fences...

20:14.500 --> 20:16.200
then maybe I wouldn't be here.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.900
While he was busy protecting your books,
where the hell were his?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.200
What's that got to do with anything?

20:26.200 --> 20:28.900
I'm glad he cared so much about you.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.900
But why doesn't he care as much
about himself?

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
Because nobody was there for Tray.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.500
If he hadn't been there to cover my back,
maybe I wouldn't care about myself either.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.600
And that would be an awful waste.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.800
I shall load Mr. Tray's belongings
into the cannon.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.200
I mean cab, madam.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.700
We miss you in the 'hood, homeboy.
Why don't you come on back with me?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.100
No, I better cool out here, man.

21:10.900 --> 21:14.400
If Uncle Phil woke up and I wasn't here,
he'd have a nervous breakdown.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.300
I'd recover, Will.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
I'm really going to miss you, Ice Tray.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.400
Bye, Mrs. Banks. Thanks for inviting me.
We gotta do this again.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.400
Have a safe trip back.
Take care of yourself.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.400
Thanks.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.400
Snap. I almost forgot.
I got a little something for y'all.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.900
- That's our china dog.
- Yeah.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.300
I figured y'all were so nice to me
and everything that I don't need it.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.700
That was a joke.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.300
You've become a part of my spirit
that's never been touched before.

22:08.500 --> 22:12.600
I feel a oneness with you,
and now that you're leaving I just...

22:13.500 --> 22:17.400
have this sense that life will be empty,
hollow, and meaningless.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.100
Peep this, babe.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.100
See, I have this first-class ticket.

22:24.200 --> 22:27.400
We could go down to the airport
and trade it for two coach tickets...

22:27.500 --> 22:30.400
and you could come back to Philly
with me. What do you think?

22:30.600 --> 22:31.600
Coach?
