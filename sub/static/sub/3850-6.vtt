WEBVTT

00:00.141 --> 00:01.881
- That sounds great.
- It's a date, then.

00:01.905 --> 00:04.359
- Previously on "Mistresses"...
- We have to end it now

00:04.410 --> 00:06.528
so there can at least be
hope for us in the future.

00:06.579 --> 00:08.113
- What?
- It's too soon.

00:08.164 --> 00:09.531
We're just not ready.

00:09.533 --> 00:11.032
I forgot to give it to Patty.

00:11.083 --> 00:12.868
- What, you don't trust me?
- Okay.

00:12.952 --> 00:14.085
You signed the papers

00:14.120 --> 00:15.370
that gave him his own umbrella.

00:15.421 --> 00:16.538
I assumed you knew.

00:16.589 --> 00:18.540
Why else wouldn't you
have had me take a look?

00:18.542 --> 00:20.792
If I could somehow combine the two of them,

00:20.843 --> 00:23.044
it would be the perfect person for me.

00:23.046 --> 00:24.296
Do you think you might be
falling in love with them?

00:24.347 --> 00:25.714
I could.

00:27.350 --> 00:29.951

01:40.356 --> 01:41.739
Remember... you're on deck to babysit.

01:41.774 --> 01:43.274
Did you get your shift covered at work?

01:43.325 --> 01:44.525
I said I would.

01:44.576 --> 01:46.577
And do you remember where
I put the emergency numbers?

01:46.612 --> 01:47.995
In my phone under "emergency"?

01:48.030 --> 01:49.030
Do you know CPR?

01:49.032 --> 01:50.748
Seriously? April, relax.

01:50.783 --> 01:52.333
Your date's not till tomorrow night.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.202
If you start out this wound,
by tomorrow, you'll pop.

01:54.253 --> 01:55.536
I'll take the kids to see a movie,

01:55.538 --> 01:57.288
and you'll have plenty of
time to get hot for teacher.

01:57.339 --> 01:59.841
Headmaster! And really, Marc?

01:59.875 --> 02:01.592
It's not like that, anyway.

02:01.627 --> 02:03.127
It's simply an opportunity

02:03.178 --> 02:05.513
to treat a much sought-after
man to a well-cooked meal.

02:05.547 --> 02:06.931
And my lasagna will leave

02:06.965 --> 02:08.850
those other ladies in the dust.

02:08.883 --> 02:10.101
Okay, you're all good, honey.

02:10.134 --> 02:12.603
Thanks, April.

02:12.638 --> 02:15.356
Looks like Lucy's grades are improving.

02:15.390 --> 02:18.276
Is that... ? Let me see.

02:18.310 --> 02:19.777
Oh, my god.

02:19.811 --> 02:21.729
"My hero used to be my dad,

02:21.731 --> 02:24.732
but now it's my really awesome grandma."

02:26.569 --> 02:28.285
Wow. That's great.

02:31.039 --> 02:33.074
"My grandma Marjorie
is a circuit court judge

02:33.076 --> 02:34.709
for the very prestigious 9th circuit.

02:34.743 --> 02:35.993
She was not only the youngest

02:36.044 --> 02:38.662
to ever be appointed by Bill Clinton,

02:38.714 --> 02:41.499
she was the only woman
and African-American, too."

02:43.252 --> 02:44.502
Well, damn. She's my hero.

02:45.837 --> 02:48.756
Lucy, school!

02:48.807 --> 02:49.924
You okay, April?

02:49.975 --> 02:52.176
Oh, I'm fine.

03:04.856 --> 03:06.073
Patty, give me good news.

03:06.107 --> 03:08.108
No. Maybe you didn't hear me, Patty.

03:08.159 --> 03:09.693
I said good news.

03:11.413 --> 03:13.497
No. You're a lawyer!

03:13.531 --> 03:15.282
Find a loophole!

03:15.284 --> 03:16.917
Then look again!

03:20.789 --> 03:22.122
- Ow.
- I got to get up.

03:22.173 --> 03:23.957
Where are they? My little
orange friends, please.

03:25.126 --> 03:27.044
Oh.

03:27.095 --> 03:29.430
This contract is ironclad!

03:29.464 --> 03:33.684
Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:33.718 --> 03:35.018
Oh, god.

03:35.053 --> 03:36.103
Oh, my god. What are you doing?

03:36.137 --> 03:37.604
Choosing a window to jump from.

03:37.639 --> 03:39.556
Hey, honey, just come here.

03:39.607 --> 03:40.774
Please. Do not pity me.

03:40.809 --> 03:41.975
Okay.

03:42.026 --> 03:44.895
I mean, how could I be so freakin' stupid?

03:44.946 --> 03:46.980
Shh. Because you wanted to believe in him.

03:46.982 --> 03:48.031
Just shh.

03:48.066 --> 03:50.117
You developed a bit of a blind spot.

03:50.151 --> 03:51.151
Ah, "blind spot."

03:51.153 --> 03:52.653
It's more like a brain hemorrhage.

03:52.704 --> 03:55.656
Who signs something
without freakin' reading it?

03:55.658 --> 03:58.926
Mnh. Those little red sticky
arrows can be very persuasive.

03:58.928 --> 04:01.328
- You just...
- Why? Why do it like this?

04:01.379 --> 04:04.364
Why steal an accessory
line out from under me?

04:04.366 --> 04:05.532
He's screwed me in marriage before,

04:05.534 --> 04:07.301
but he has never screwed me in business.

04:07.335 --> 04:08.435
He respects that part of me.

04:08.437 --> 04:09.653
Something is off.

04:09.704 --> 04:10.804
Nothing is off.

04:10.838 --> 04:12.205
It's Luca Raines, as usual.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.141
He was slimeball before.

04:14.175 --> 04:15.292
He's a super slimeball now.

04:15.343 --> 04:17.611
That's it. Okay?

04:17.661 --> 04:18.812
Honey!

04:18.896 --> 04:20.564
Honey, please...

04:20.598 --> 04:21.964
Answer me this question.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.500
Answer me this one question.

04:23.551 --> 04:25.435
Do you actually care
about the accessories line?

04:25.503 --> 04:27.237
Do you?

04:27.239 --> 04:28.288
No, but I...

04:28.339 --> 04:30.640
Okay. So, then, what did you lose, hmm?

04:30.642 --> 04:31.942
A couple of days thinking
that your marriage

04:31.976 --> 04:33.126
was gonna work out?

04:33.177 --> 04:34.294
So, fine.

04:34.345 --> 04:35.862
Let's go back to the original plan.

04:35.897 --> 04:37.697
You're gonna divorce him,
and you're gonna make sure

04:37.748 --> 04:38.765
that he doesn't get half your empire.

04:38.799 --> 04:39.933
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.

04:39.967 --> 04:41.017
- Of course.
- Thank you.

04:41.068 --> 04:42.185
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:42.236 --> 04:43.854
I will be asleep until next week.

04:43.888 --> 04:45.472
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.

04:45.506 --> 04:46.906
If I'm leaving this pity party,

04:46.941 --> 04:48.491
you're damn well coming with me.

04:48.526 --> 04:49.676
No, it's not a party.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.528
It's not a party. It's a wake.

04:51.562 --> 04:53.213
For Harry? Please!

04:53.247 --> 04:54.431
It's an open-ended breakup.

04:54.465 --> 04:56.516
It's the best of all worlds here.

04:56.567 --> 04:57.834
Sorry.

04:57.868 --> 04:59.269
How is this the best of all worlds?

04:59.303 --> 05:00.937
He said to you... and I quote...

05:00.971 --> 05:02.922
"so you can find your
way back to each other."

05:02.957 --> 05:04.107
It's like a crystal ball,

05:04.141 --> 05:05.842
and Harry's waiting there in the future,

05:05.876 --> 05:09.312
and he's giving you the green
light to go have some fun.

05:09.347 --> 05:10.413
There's no green light.

05:10.448 --> 05:12.749
If it was any greener, we could smoke it.

05:12.751 --> 05:14.484
If you two are meant to be together,

05:14.518 --> 05:15.785
you'll end up together.

05:15.787 --> 05:17.887
The best way to get over a man

05:17.922 --> 05:19.722
is to get under another one.

05:19.757 --> 05:21.474
You should stitch that on a pillow.

05:21.509 --> 05:22.442
That's really good.

05:22.476 --> 05:24.027
I'm telling you... Harry is not

05:24.061 --> 05:25.395
lying around moping like this.

05:25.429 --> 05:26.663
- Let's go.
- All right.

05:26.665 --> 05:27.764
- Get up!
- All right.

05:29.867 --> 05:31.885
Yeah!

05:37.775 --> 05:40.143
Surf report looks good. Let's go.

05:40.177 --> 05:42.312
Yeah, I don't think I can, mate.

05:43.947 --> 05:45.481
Can I come in?

05:45.516 --> 05:47.550
Sure.

05:53.707 --> 05:55.091
Ah, that's more like it!

05:55.125 --> 05:56.559
Now I can see what I'm working with.

05:56.610 --> 05:58.411
All right.

05:58.462 --> 06:01.180
No more girls-gone-wrong reminders.

06:01.231 --> 06:03.249
This Joss'?

06:07.705 --> 06:08.638
This?

06:08.672 --> 06:09.622
Well, it ain't mine.

06:11.024 --> 06:13.075
All right, I'm gonna put
this in the closet here.

06:13.127 --> 06:14.811
If I've missed anything, you toss it in.

06:14.845 --> 06:16.996
If you need the box out
of here, I'll pick it up.

06:19.299 --> 06:20.950
How's the restaurant?

06:21.001 --> 06:22.418
Fine.

06:22.452 --> 06:23.386
Marc?

06:23.388 --> 06:24.353
It's a disaster, dude.

06:24.388 --> 06:25.488
You need to come back.

06:25.490 --> 06:26.923
I mean, Phil's a fine sous chef,

06:26.957 --> 06:29.191
but he is not equipped to
do a fraction of what you do.

06:29.226 --> 06:31.427
Lag time between courses
is like 35 minutes.

06:31.461 --> 06:32.845
And ever since he started
dating that Indian guy,

06:32.879 --> 06:34.280
he's got a love affair with cumin, man.

06:34.314 --> 06:35.614
Everything has cumin!

06:37.200 --> 06:38.968
Okay.

06:40.404 --> 06:41.404
All right, right-o.

06:41.406 --> 06:43.222
Look, we'll catch some waves.

06:43.256 --> 06:44.640
It'll clear my head.

06:44.675 --> 06:46.325
I'll be back in tonight.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.410
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

06:47.444 --> 06:48.678
Hey, look, if you're not up for it...

06:48.729 --> 06:50.079
No, no. I'm good.

06:55.852 --> 06:57.553
Why were you going through my backpack?

06:57.555 --> 06:59.071
I wasn't going through your backpack.

06:59.122 --> 07:00.206
The point is, baby, it's amazing.

07:00.257 --> 07:01.323
I am proud of you!

07:01.358 --> 07:02.908
A-plus?

07:05.345 --> 07:06.979
Good morning, Lucy. I have good news.

07:07.030 --> 07:08.798
Your hero paper is going in
the front case of the school.

07:08.832 --> 07:10.299
- Everyone's impressed.
- Really?

07:10.301 --> 07:11.734
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool. Thanks, Mr. P.

07:11.768 --> 07:12.902
You're welcome.

07:14.271 --> 07:16.689
I said I was impressed, and
I got a stank shoulder shrug.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.207
How much you want to bet, as headmaster,

07:18.209 --> 07:19.942
I get more stanky shrugs than you a day?

07:19.976 --> 07:21.277
I guess you're right.

07:21.311 --> 07:23.479
I only have one little
mean person to deal with.

07:23.513 --> 07:25.914
Well, have you asked Grandma
Marjorie for any help?

07:25.966 --> 07:27.299
I'd take advantage of
the positive influence

07:27.350 --> 07:28.734
she seems to have on Lucy.

07:28.768 --> 07:30.719
Shoot. I'd like to ask
her for some advice myself.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.821
Yeah. No.

07:32.856 --> 07:34.606
I mean, my mother is really busy,

07:34.658 --> 07:36.475
not to mention, she
doesn't live here in town.

07:36.509 --> 07:38.394
I hear that, but that's her grandbaby.

07:38.428 --> 07:40.412
I would think she'd make it
important to be supportive...

07:40.463 --> 07:41.547
of you both.

07:41.598 --> 07:42.514
Plus, it takes a village, right?

07:42.565 --> 07:43.866
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.167
Especially if she's the one person

07:45.169 --> 07:47.069
Lucy's identifying with right now.

07:49.672 --> 07:52.024
If... I haven't crossed the line,

07:52.058 --> 07:53.959
I still hope to see you tomorrow night.

07:54.010 --> 07:56.311
I'll let you know when
you've crossed the line.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.138
Okay, I called Amex.

08:06.172 --> 08:10.108
Um, last place Luca used this
card was at the Oceana Hotel.

08:10.159 --> 08:13.228
Grease anybody... the waiters,
the bartenders, the valet,

08:13.263 --> 08:14.696
anyone who's gonna take a shot of him

08:14.731 --> 08:15.981
and whatever whore he's with now.

08:16.032 --> 08:17.332
- Sure thing, boss.
- Okay.

08:17.334 --> 08:18.383
Save your money, Calista.

08:20.787 --> 08:22.137
We need to talk.

08:22.171 --> 08:23.972
Oh. What is it now?

08:24.007 --> 08:26.858
You want your own bridal line, huh? Okay.

08:26.909 --> 08:28.877
That's funny. That's very funny.

08:28.928 --> 08:30.512
No. I want a divorce.

08:33.282 --> 08:35.082
You want a divorce?

08:35.118 --> 08:36.618
On what grounds?

08:36.653 --> 08:38.285
The fact that I wouldn't
tolerate your cheating?

08:38.288 --> 08:40.438
Or because you built a career

08:40.472 --> 08:41.923
on my blood, sweat, and tears?

08:41.957 --> 08:43.457
You're not getting a cent.

08:43.493 --> 08:44.793
Divorce not granted.

08:44.827 --> 08:47.262
I'm in love with someone else.

08:48.931 --> 08:50.532
Eva Petrov. I think you know her.

08:52.869 --> 08:54.386
We're gonna be married.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.758
So, you have been cheating this whole time.

08:59.842 --> 09:02.110
You know what? She loves me.

09:02.144 --> 09:04.246
And she admires me.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.780
And I love and admire her.

09:05.815 --> 09:08.433
Why? Because she can go
a week without eating?

09:08.484 --> 09:10.535
You know, you can
denigrate her all you want.

09:11.871 --> 09:14.255
But she happens to be
a very talented artist.

09:14.273 --> 09:16.925
- Oh.
- Oh, no, you said so yourself.

09:16.959 --> 09:19.377
You know, the accessory
line you approved...

09:19.412 --> 09:22.330
that was all Eva's design.

09:22.332 --> 09:24.215
And after it launches successfully,

09:24.250 --> 09:27.168
I'll reveal her as the true creative force.

09:27.219 --> 09:29.971
And don't bother bringing
her into our divorce

09:30.005 --> 09:31.339
because you have no proof of our affair,

09:31.341 --> 09:33.007
and she would roundly deny it.

09:38.514 --> 09:40.315
I will kill you

09:40.349 --> 09:41.850
before I let you do this.

09:41.852 --> 09:43.852
It's already done.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.990
Father John, I'm so
sorry. I hate being late,

09:56.997 --> 09:58.831
but I don't have a watch on
today, and I left my phone

09:58.866 --> 10:02.668
at my, uh friend's house this morning.

10:02.809 --> 10:03.909
It's okay.

10:03.961 --> 10:05.127
It's no sin to have a boyfriend.

10:05.129 --> 10:07.163
Just because you're
counseling married couples

10:07.197 --> 10:08.347
doesn't mean you have
to be married yourself.

10:08.382 --> 10:10.766
Now, um...

10:10.801 --> 10:12.268
Vivian.

10:12.302 --> 10:13.869
I was hoping you didn't
change your schedule.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.438
I rushed home to get my earbuds,

10:15.472 --> 10:16.989
and I saw your phone
on the kitchen counter,

10:17.040 --> 10:19.208
and I just knew you'd be
going crazy without it.

10:19.242 --> 10:22.478
Ah. You really shouldn't
have gone to so much trouble.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.913
It was no trouble at all, sweetie.

10:23.964 --> 10:26.415
Hi. I'm Vivian. How are you?

10:26.450 --> 10:27.883
Blessed. I'm Father John.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.919
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

10:29.953 --> 10:31.554
Well, I don't want to take
up any more of your time,

10:31.588 --> 10:33.522
so I'll see you at home later.

10:35.459 --> 10:36.475
Bye.

10:39.579 --> 10:41.113
I apologize.

10:41.148 --> 10:44.066
I... I never should've assumed
that you had a boyfriend.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.369
But I want to reassure you that
we are very progressive here.

10:47.484 --> 10:49.285
There's at least three
other homosexual couples

10:49.319 --> 10:51.553
in the congregation that I know of.

10:51.588 --> 10:53.389
We welcome everyone.

10:53.423 --> 10:55.124
- I don't...
- You know what?

10:55.158 --> 10:56.709
We're having a mixer tomorrow night.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.128
Bring Vivian. It'll be fun.

10:59.162 --> 11:00.729
I hear we're getting a Kogi truck.

11:00.764 --> 11:02.531
Yum.

11:02.549 --> 11:03.899
I feel like a liar!

11:03.933 --> 11:05.334
You're not a liar!

11:05.368 --> 11:06.768
Ow. Yelling hurts.

11:06.803 --> 11:07.736
Sorry, sweetie. Here.

11:07.770 --> 11:08.737
Mm. Thank you.

11:08.771 --> 11:09.905
He suggested my mom come,

11:09.956 --> 11:11.306
and I just silently sat there.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.956
So... you don't even know Blair.

11:13.990 --> 11:15.624
What... what were you supposed say?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.808
"I hate the woman who bore me"?

11:16.859 --> 11:17.793
It's not attractive.

11:17.827 --> 11:18.844
I don't hate her.

11:19.796 --> 11:21.196
Well, maybe he has a point.

11:21.198 --> 11:22.798
Oh, god, I don't know.

11:22.832 --> 11:24.449
Forget this.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.751
How are you?

11:25.802 --> 11:27.786
- Hmm?
- Have you talked to Harry?

11:27.820 --> 11:30.505
No, not since he brought
down the hatchet on my heart.

11:32.341 --> 11:34.176
I... I'm sorry. Is this not interesting?

11:34.193 --> 11:36.011
That guy is staring at you.

11:36.045 --> 11:36.962
Hmm?

11:38.748 --> 11:40.248
Brad?!

11:40.283 --> 11:41.967
- Oh, my god.
- Josslyn Carver.

11:42.018 --> 11:43.685
I knew it was you.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.203
What is up? What are you doing?

11:45.254 --> 11:47.222
Come here! This is crazy!

11:47.273 --> 11:49.207
I know. I lost your
number like two phones ago.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.776
You give the best hugs.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.395
What are you doing here?

11:53.429 --> 11:55.063
Just in town for my mom's birthday.

11:55.097 --> 11:57.566
I was looking for a present.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.484
God, look at you!

11:59.519 --> 12:01.920
You look exactly the same
as you did in college.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.605
You look better than you did,

12:03.656 --> 12:05.574
and... and you looked good.

12:05.591 --> 12:06.975
So, where to start?

12:07.009 --> 12:08.143
- Oh.
- You married?

12:08.194 --> 12:09.144
No. You?

12:09.178 --> 12:10.095
No.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.864
Well, look at us.

12:12.915 --> 12:14.015
Come on. You surprised? I mean...

12:14.050 --> 12:15.900
neither of us were ever
the settling-down type.

12:15.951 --> 12:18.253
That's probably why we
were so good together.

12:18.287 --> 12:20.088
Yeah, that and you were crazy about me.

12:20.122 --> 12:21.823
I certainly was.

12:21.857 --> 12:23.475
- Anyway, I...
- Hey, listen...

12:23.526 --> 12:24.559
- Oh.
- Sorry.

12:24.593 --> 12:26.010
No. No, no, no. You go.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.979
I have to go to this party,
but I'm in town for the week.

12:28.030 --> 12:28.997
Oh, uh...

12:30.182 --> 12:33.001
Uh, sorry. Just one second.

12:34.303 --> 12:35.987
Hey, girl, what...

12:37.540 --> 12:38.940
What... Calista, are you crying?

12:38.974 --> 12:41.009
No. Calm down. I can't understand you.

12:41.043 --> 12:42.844
Okay, okay. I'll be right there.

12:42.895 --> 12:43.912
Everything okay?

12:43.946 --> 12:45.246
Uh, yeah. That was my friend.

12:45.281 --> 12:47.382
Well, my boss, my... "Fross."

12:47.433 --> 12:49.651
I... I got to go, but you know what, Brad?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.052
It was really good to see you.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.387
You too.

12:52.389 --> 12:53.788
Take care.

12:53.822 --> 12:55.423
Mm-hmm.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.127
Take care.

13:02.832 --> 13:04.365
I said mind-blowing ideas.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.501
Let's knock the wind out of this bastard.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.136
How about just telling the truth?

13:08.187 --> 13:10.338
Leak your story to the
press, how Luca bamboozled you

13:10.340 --> 13:11.723
into signing over the accessories line,

13:11.757 --> 13:13.107
leak your then gave it
to his two-bit whore.

13:13.109 --> 13:14.208
People will hate him.

13:14.243 --> 13:15.643
You know what I love about that, Patty?

13:15.678 --> 13:16.811
Nothing.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.746
It makes me look like a fool.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.131
Any other bright ideas?

13:20.182 --> 13:21.182
Okay. Okay.

13:21.184 --> 13:22.283
How about this?

13:22.318 --> 13:23.451
We round up all the buyers and tell them

13:23.502 --> 13:24.819
that if they touch a single gem

13:24.853 --> 13:25.820
from Luca's accessories line,

13:25.854 --> 13:27.555
they get nothing from you ever.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.941
No preview of your
collections, no samples, zip.

13:29.992 --> 13:31.259
And then I tank the line?

13:31.293 --> 13:32.343
It's my brand!

13:32.394 --> 13:33.561
If it fails, I fail.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.646
So, you want it to succeed?

13:35.681 --> 13:37.365
And, what, give them a wedding present

13:37.416 --> 13:38.633
with my name on the card?

13:38.667 --> 13:40.952
I... don't think I'm alone here

13:40.986 --> 13:42.170
in saying, "confused."

13:43.422 --> 13:46.023
You should have seen him...

13:46.074 --> 13:49.644
so glowing and happy, in love.

13:49.678 --> 13:51.078
Okay, going down the k-hole.

13:51.113 --> 13:53.314
Okay, fine. I'm back.

13:53.348 --> 13:54.615
Well, it seems, from
a business perspective,

13:54.650 --> 13:56.217
you have to stand behind the line.

13:56.251 --> 13:57.435
Blame it on the blonde,
but what does that mean,

13:57.486 --> 13:58.719
"stand behind the line"?

13:58.754 --> 14:00.254
Patty, it's not like she
can go out and promote it.

14:00.288 --> 14:02.123
I can.

14:02.157 --> 14:04.008
I can.

14:05.410 --> 14:09.063
Joss, can you do a preview
party here tomorrow night?

14:09.097 --> 14:10.531
Um, what are you thinking?

14:10.582 --> 14:12.633
About 100 people...

14:12.667 --> 14:14.301
And press.

14:14.352 --> 14:17.121
Let's get lots of press.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.877
Ah, Harry, my man.

14:22.911 --> 14:25.279
A word, please.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.181
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not too close.

14:27.215 --> 14:28.549
'Cause I don't want to get what you had.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.634
So, how you feeling?

14:30.685 --> 14:32.570
100%. Thanks.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.407
Hey, whoa. So, what... what
was it, a bad cold, flu?

14:36.441 --> 14:38.292
Hope it wasn't food poisoning.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.727
I'd have to fire the chef.

14:41.029 --> 14:42.680
- Which is you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:42.731 --> 14:44.999
I'd hate to do that.

14:45.033 --> 14:47.334
Okay. You have a good night.

14:47.336 --> 14:49.103
- Have a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

14:50.105 --> 14:52.673
Hey, stranger. Glad you're back.

14:52.707 --> 14:55.209
Yeah, well, I heard Phil
was making a mess of things.

14:55.211 --> 14:56.727
Couldn't let that go on, now, could I?

14:56.761 --> 14:58.078
What?

14:59.964 --> 15:00.981
I told Marc to tell you that.

15:01.016 --> 15:02.983
I knew it'd get your ass out of bed.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.387
Well, I wasn't in bed, as such.

15:06.438 --> 15:10.591
I was, uh, in couch, deeply in couch.

15:10.625 --> 15:11.875
Yeah. Okay.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.927
The staff is gonna hang tonight.

15:13.929 --> 15:15.195
Why don't you stay and play?

15:15.230 --> 15:18.232
You don't have a girlfriend
to rush back to, right?

15:20.285 --> 15:21.468
Uh...

15:22.971 --> 15:25.873
Yeah, maybe some other time.

15:30.411 --> 15:32.980
Aw, man!

15:33.014 --> 15:34.898
Hey, Marc, can I talk to you for a second?

15:34.933 --> 15:35.949
Aw, it's the smell, isn't it?

15:35.984 --> 15:37.885
Oh, it's not that.

15:37.919 --> 15:39.519
You know Blair, right?

15:39.571 --> 15:40.821
Uh, yes, April, I do.

15:40.872 --> 15:42.339
No. Of course.

15:42.390 --> 15:44.992
Well, he thinks it would be a good idea

15:45.026 --> 15:47.194
to have my mother come for a visit...

15:47.228 --> 15:49.062
you know, extended family for Lucy,

15:49.097 --> 15:50.998
someone to talk to, blah, blah.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.950
But I don't know how that would be for you.

15:55.219 --> 15:57.104
She's got kind of...

15:57.155 --> 15:59.306
a drinking problem.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.724
Ah.

16:00.855 --> 16:02.522
See? I knew it was a bad idea.

16:02.524 --> 16:03.490
That's it. It's settled.

16:03.524 --> 16:05.692
No, no, wait a minute. Just hold on.

16:05.726 --> 16:08.895
First of all, it's really decent of you

16:08.930 --> 16:11.164
to think of me, but I work in a bar.

16:11.199 --> 16:12.732
One visit from Granny's

16:12.767 --> 16:14.351
not gonna shake my sobriety.

16:14.385 --> 16:16.570
Oh.

16:16.572 --> 16:18.255
Well, I mean, that's good.

16:18.306 --> 16:20.690
And, hey, she's not like a fall-down drunk.

16:20.741 --> 16:22.459
She's expertly functioning.

16:22.493 --> 16:23.627
Well, whatever that means, right?

16:23.678 --> 16:24.511
Right?

16:24.562 --> 16:26.880
What does that mean?

16:29.150 --> 16:31.017
It means that out in the world,

16:31.052 --> 16:33.420
she's flawless, and at home...

16:35.272 --> 16:37.957
Okay, when I was 16,

16:38.008 --> 16:40.393
around the time of the
LAPD Rampart scandal,

16:40.444 --> 16:42.595
I was all, you know, "power to the people."

16:42.630 --> 16:45.565
so, I went out with a couple
of my derelict friends...

16:45.567 --> 16:46.866
Oh, come on. You had derelict friends?

16:46.868 --> 16:48.635
That was what my father
called the "artsy" crowd.

16:48.637 --> 16:49.636
Oh, right on.

16:49.687 --> 16:51.037
Anyway, uh, while they waited

16:51.071 --> 16:52.005
with the van running,

16:52.039 --> 16:54.140
I painted a mural of Angela Davis,

16:54.191 --> 16:56.409
Maya Angelou, and Foxy Brown on this wall

16:56.411 --> 16:58.044
off the 110 freeway as the protest...

16:58.095 --> 16:59.312
Oh, that... that's yours?

16:59.346 --> 17:01.047
I've seen that mural. It's awesome!

17:01.081 --> 17:02.248
I... it got a lot of attention.

17:02.299 --> 17:03.683
The city wanted to take it down,

17:03.685 --> 17:05.151
but that was not the right time

17:05.185 --> 17:06.886
to piss more black people off.

17:06.921 --> 17:08.855
Thousands of people signed
a petition to keep it up.

17:08.888 --> 17:10.272
You're a badass!

17:10.324 --> 17:13.343
Well... my father didn't think so.

17:13.442 --> 17:14.492
Mm.

17:14.526 --> 17:16.127
The daughter of an ethics professor

17:16.128 --> 17:18.112
and a respected judge breaking the law?

17:18.146 --> 17:21.132
Mm, he gave me the belt for it good.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.818
Dads and their belts.

17:25.371 --> 17:27.472
I remember mine well.

17:27.506 --> 17:30.158
It was a different time.

17:30.192 --> 17:32.643
Yeah.

17:32.678 --> 17:35.546
And where was your mom through all this?

17:35.581 --> 17:37.348
Sitting in the next room

17:37.382 --> 17:39.350
with her third drink in her hand.

17:42.454 --> 17:46.591
Anyway, um, I know Lucy isn't
connecting to me right now,

17:46.625 --> 17:47.758
and Blair thinks...

17:47.809 --> 17:49.927
April...

17:49.929 --> 17:51.429
Are you sure it matters what Blair thinks?

17:54.066 --> 17:55.433
What do you think?

17:55.484 --> 17:57.001
What do you feel in your gut?

18:00.188 --> 18:01.322
I don't want her here.

18:03.659 --> 18:05.276
Then don't have her.

18:07.996 --> 18:09.163
Thank you.

18:09.197 --> 18:11.782
Right.

18:11.784 --> 18:14.034
Thank you. Thank you, Marc.

18:14.086 --> 18:15.286
Yeah.

18:15.337 --> 18:17.788
You bet.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.775
Yeah, that is correct. 8:00
P.M. tonight, Calista's estate.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.943
Mm-hmm. Uh...

18:33.112 --> 18:34.879
Uh, yes, yes, she would absolutely love

18:34.881 --> 18:36.064
for her friends at Vanity Fair to be here.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.749
Can I talk to you?

18:37.751 --> 18:40.201
It is short notice, but, you know,

18:40.236 --> 18:42.754
let's look at it as one
of Calista Raines' designs.

18:42.805 --> 18:44.772
It's thrilling and unpredictable.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.160
I know.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.795
So, we'll s... we'll see you tonight?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.447
Wonderful. Ciao.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.832
- What? What?
- What's she doing?

18:54.867 --> 18:56.267
What is who doing?

18:56.285 --> 18:58.503
What is Calista's angle with this party?

18:58.537 --> 18:59.988
- Her angle?
- Mm-hmm.

19:00.075 --> 19:01.542
Luca, she's a shrewd businesswoman

19:01.544 --> 19:03.243
who knows that the best
thing to do for the company

19:03.278 --> 19:05.079
that she's worked her entire life to build

19:05.081 --> 19:06.230
is stand by your sorry ass

19:06.264 --> 19:07.498
and promote the hell out of the line.

19:07.532 --> 19:09.600
Okay.

19:09.651 --> 19:12.503
Make sure that Eva's on the guest list.

19:12.537 --> 19:15.222
And, uh...

19:20.762 --> 19:23.397
Well, you know your man. That's for sure.

19:23.431 --> 19:25.299
Just like you said, he
asked me what your angle was.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.501
- I basically came off like I don't know a damn thing.
- Did he buy it?

19:27.503 --> 19:28.936
Yeah, because I don't know a damn thing.

19:28.987 --> 19:30.671
- When are you gonna tell me what the plan is?
- Okay.

19:30.705 --> 19:33.073
Take that dress and bring
it over to Kathy Cho's house.

19:33.107 --> 19:34.157
What, now?

19:34.192 --> 19:35.759
- Yes.
- As in right now?

19:35.810 --> 19:36.248
Uh-huh.

19:36.249 --> 19:38.649
You have 100 guests coming
to your house in 3 hours.

19:39.414 --> 19:41.481
Oh. Uh, hello?

19:41.483 --> 19:44.568
Brad? I... how did you...

19:44.602 --> 19:46.286
I'm listed?

19:46.371 --> 19:48.805
No. I can't tonight. I have a work thing.

19:48.856 --> 19:50.490
But let me, uh... let me check my schedule,

19:50.541 --> 19:51.858
and I'll get back to...

19:51.893 --> 19:54.027
I... I will. I promise.

19:55.797 --> 19:57.731
Okay. Okay. Bye.

19:57.765 --> 19:59.716
Mm. You're smiling.

19:59.751 --> 20:01.301
First time in a week. Who was that?

20:01.303 --> 20:02.636
An old bed buddy from college.

20:02.670 --> 20:03.837
I ran into him yesterday.

20:03.871 --> 20:04.838
Great. I'll put his name on the list.

20:04.889 --> 20:07.023
- What? No.
- Why not? Bad lay?

20:07.074 --> 20:08.241
No. Good lay.

20:08.276 --> 20:09.810
Great lay, actually, but...

20:09.844 --> 20:10.811
But nothing.

20:10.845 --> 20:12.412
God planted a guy right in your lap.

20:12.446 --> 20:13.497
It's divine intervention.

20:13.531 --> 20:15.048
Just accept it with grace.

20:15.050 --> 20:16.049
Okay, I'm not a religious person,

20:16.083 --> 20:17.150
but I'm pretty sure that that's

20:17.201 --> 20:18.451
not what they mean by divine intervention.

20:18.486 --> 20:19.636
Look, I don't want you pouting

20:19.670 --> 20:20.687
in a corner somewhere tonight.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.122
Everyone is gonna have a plus-one...

20:22.156 --> 20:24.641
except me, but I will be busy.

20:24.675 --> 20:26.943
Busy with what?

20:30.715 --> 20:33.316
And what is so funny?

20:33.367 --> 20:37.604
Father John thinks me and
Vivian are lesbian lovers.

20:37.606 --> 20:40.340
I'm... I'm sorry. What?

20:40.391 --> 20:41.975
I left my phone here yesterday.

20:42.009 --> 20:43.109
And I brought it to her,

20:43.160 --> 20:44.878
and he caught our energy, I guess.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.179
"Caught our energy"?

20:46.230 --> 20:48.198
You called me "sweetie"
and kissed me on the lips.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.985
Anyway, he invited us to a mixer tonight.

20:52.019 --> 20:53.703
Monkeys will fly out of my ass

20:53.754 --> 20:55.488
before I go to a church mixer.

20:55.523 --> 20:56.689
Whoa.

20:56.724 --> 20:59.492
No one's suggesting we go
to the church mixer, Alec.

20:59.527 --> 21:00.960
But the thought of going out somewhere

21:00.995 --> 21:02.245
does sound kind of nice.

21:02.279 --> 21:03.530
Oh, there was that, uh,

21:03.564 --> 21:05.048
new restaurant downtown we wanted to try.

21:05.099 --> 21:06.232
What was it called, Alec?

21:06.267 --> 21:07.834
I see nothing wrong with staying here

21:07.836 --> 21:09.135
where we don't have to worry.

21:11.472 --> 21:13.273
Worry about what?

21:14.491 --> 21:15.742
Well, we don't need to be "out"

21:15.793 --> 21:17.644
while we're out, if that
makes you feel better.

21:17.646 --> 21:20.330
We can just be three people having dinner.

21:20.381 --> 21:22.115
So, you're suggesting we hide.

21:22.149 --> 21:23.983
- No.
- Yes.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.151
Oh! Okay.

21:25.185 --> 21:26.886
Okay.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.288
Don't be upset, Karen.

21:28.322 --> 21:30.123
Karen, talk to me.

21:31.842 --> 21:33.276
It's just...

21:33.310 --> 21:34.911
I've been that person before

21:34.962 --> 21:38.998
in a relationship where it's
only okay behind closed doors.

21:39.033 --> 21:42.402
Karen, I am a well-respected
surgeon at County General.

21:42.436 --> 21:43.936
I have to be careful what I advertise.

21:43.971 --> 21:45.855
I get it, Alec, okay?

21:45.889 --> 21:49.175
I wasn't exactly forthcoming
with Father John, was I?

21:49.209 --> 21:51.661
I'm not saying I have the answers.

21:51.695 --> 21:53.579
- I'm just...
- Okay, how about this?

21:53.630 --> 21:55.047
You two finish putting away the groceries,

21:55.082 --> 21:56.816
and I am going to find a place

21:56.818 --> 21:59.135
where we can go out and be happy.

21:59.186 --> 22:00.186
- Vivian...
- That's okay...

22:00.220 --> 22:01.537
Shut up, both of you.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.639
We're gonna be happy, damn it.

22:10.130 --> 22:11.097
Hi.

22:12.900 --> 22:13.833
You look great.

22:13.850 --> 22:15.268
Thanks. You look great, too.

22:15.319 --> 22:17.119
I, uh... I didn't know
what you were making.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.220
Lasagna.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.208
We'll do red, and white with dessert.

22:22.242 --> 22:23.292
I like where your head's at.

22:25.145 --> 22:29.749
So, a little preview?

22:29.766 --> 22:30.883
Mmm, yes, please.

22:30.934 --> 22:31.984
Okay. It's hot.

22:32.035 --> 22:32.985
Mmm.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.123
Mm-mmm!

22:37.157 --> 22:38.073
Mmm!

22:38.125 --> 22:39.258
I need this recipe.

22:39.260 --> 22:40.609
It's an old family secret.

22:40.644 --> 22:42.128
- Mmm.
- My mother's, actually.

22:42.162 --> 22:42.962
It's good.

22:44.164 --> 22:45.648
Listen.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.066
You know yesterday when you mentioned

22:47.100 --> 22:48.017
my mother coming for a visit?

22:48.051 --> 22:49.068
Mm, I'm sorry.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.703
I... I spend all day advising parents,

22:50.705 --> 22:52.004
and sometimes I don't know when to stop.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.606
No. It's okay.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.508
I mean, look, I'd love
to have a village around

22:56.510 --> 22:58.077
to help me raise Lucy.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.912
But me and my mom...

22:59.946 --> 23:01.413
we don't get on that well.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.649
We haven't for some time now.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.134
Oh. I... I'm sorry to hear that.

23:05.168 --> 23:07.353
I mean, we, uh, see
each other for Christmas,

23:07.355 --> 23:09.838
and if we get to new
year's without a fight,

23:09.889 --> 23:11.423
it's a damn near miracle.

23:11.425 --> 23:14.793
I just didn't want you to think
I didn't value your advice.

23:14.795 --> 23:16.061
Well, you don't owe me...

23:16.096 --> 23:17.579
But thank you.

23:18.615 --> 23:20.516
Good, then. Okay.

23:20.550 --> 23:23.902
Um, just one thing.

23:23.904 --> 23:25.504
I know you and Lucy are having a hard time,

23:25.555 --> 23:27.856
but you modeling to her that a relationship

23:27.907 --> 23:28.907
between a mother and a daughter

23:28.909 --> 23:32.244
can actually break and stay broken...

23:32.278 --> 23:35.981
well, I'd imagine that
could be scary for a child...

23:36.032 --> 23:37.916
Not to mention for you.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.032
You guys still having fun?

23:54.034 --> 23:56.118
- I'm cold.
- I'm hungry.

23:56.169 --> 23:57.469
What happened to the pork
rinds and the twinkies

23:57.471 --> 23:58.437
you bought at the liquor store?

23:58.471 --> 23:59.538
Scotty gave them

23:59.572 --> 24:00.956
to that homeless person with the dog.

24:00.990 --> 24:03.208
Look... more helicopters.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.810
Where are we going?

24:04.812 --> 24:06.745
Trust me... this is
way better than a movie.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.497
What's better than a movie?

24:08.531 --> 24:09.848
A piece of art history.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.416
Do you know any influential artists, Lucy?

24:11.451 --> 24:13.368
Because I do... your mom.

24:13.403 --> 24:15.087
And I am so juiced for you to see this.

24:15.138 --> 24:17.356
Can we see it after we pee?

24:17.358 --> 24:18.490
How bad do you got to go?

24:18.541 --> 24:19.491
I just went a little.

24:19.493 --> 24:20.542
Aw, shoot. Okay.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.060
Let's find you a nice... uh, there.

24:22.095 --> 24:23.228
That is you right there, buddy.

24:23.279 --> 24:24.579
You are not officially a man

24:24.614 --> 24:26.181
until you've done a nature tinkle.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.567
I have to go, too.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.035
Well, that's not gonna work.

24:30.037 --> 24:31.253
Uh...

24:31.287 --> 24:34.673
Uh, here, here, here.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.342
Yeah, here we go.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.544
Yeah, this is good. This is good. Okay.

24:39.595 --> 24:41.346
Go ahead, guys, right here.

24:56.283 --> 24:59.418
Oh, you sure know how to throw a party.

24:59.420 --> 25:00.602
Okay, when are you gonna tell me the plan?

25:00.653 --> 25:01.870
In due time.

25:01.905 --> 25:03.255
Dude, come on.

25:03.290 --> 25:06.025
Just concentrate on the
boys I invited for you.

25:06.059 --> 25:08.026
There's no need for them. I brought Brad.

25:08.028 --> 25:10.162
You listened! Where is he?

25:10.196 --> 25:11.397
He's standing over at the bar,

25:11.431 --> 25:13.298
making Tom Ford very proud.

25:13.350 --> 25:14.933
Ooh. You know how to pick them.

25:14.968 --> 25:16.335
Mm. Very nice.

25:16.337 --> 25:17.636
Mm. Look who it is.

25:17.670 --> 25:19.071
- Oh.
- Eva.

25:19.073 --> 25:21.173
Oh, well, yeah, let's take some pictures.

25:21.175 --> 25:22.341
- Geez.
- This is great.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.543
She came separately, without Luca.

25:24.577 --> 25:27.186
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

25:27.187 --> 25:30.115
Just make sure you tell
me when Kathy Cho's here.

25:30.149 --> 25:31.583
What is the deal with this chick?

25:31.634 --> 25:33.852
I haven't wanted to meet a
woman this bad since Madonna.

25:33.887 --> 25:37.189
Calista, you look lovely.

25:37.223 --> 25:38.874
And you look old and sallow.

25:38.958 --> 25:40.943
I see you put me at Eva's table.

25:40.994 --> 25:42.761
What, do you think I'm gonna forget myself

25:42.795 --> 25:45.147
and let some photographer catch
me with my hand on her knee?

25:45.198 --> 25:47.499
You've foiled me again.

25:47.533 --> 25:49.534
I forget how smart you are.

25:51.269 --> 25:53.638
No, but, really, was that the plan?

25:53.672 --> 25:55.173
- 'Cause it's not terrible.
- It's not the plan, though.

25:55.175 --> 25:57.075
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.543
Oh, okay. Bye.

25:58.578 --> 26:00.979
- Oh.
- One and two and three.

26:04.184 --> 26:06.201
Harry, wait. Don't leave yet.

26:06.435 --> 26:08.136
Tessa's trying to see if we
can get Wunderbar to trend.

26:08.271 --> 26:09.921
Sorry. Who is doing what now?

26:09.923 --> 26:10.939
Take a selfie with us.

26:10.973 --> 26:12.207
You know what?

26:12.241 --> 26:13.208
Why not? Let's give it a go.

26:13.259 --> 26:15.060
All right. Tessa, get over here.

26:15.094 --> 26:16.194
Harry's down.

26:17.913 --> 26:19.297
- Yeah.
- All right.

26:19.332 --> 26:20.699
Mm.

26:21.701 --> 26:22.634
Oh, boy.

26:22.636 --> 26:23.601
Okay, let's have a look.

26:23.636 --> 26:24.786
Oy.

26:24.837 --> 26:26.554
I look like a goon.

26:26.605 --> 26:27.656
It's posted on Instagram.

26:27.690 --> 26:29.240
Really? That is... hey, wait. Wait. Wait.

26:29.242 --> 26:30.625
Just... just go back two.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.277
There.

26:32.328 --> 26:35.313
When w... when was that photo posted?

26:35.347 --> 26:37.115
Uh, 18 minutes ago.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.967
Calista Raines is having
a big party right now.

26:39.018 --> 26:40.985
She's been posting all night.

26:40.987 --> 26:42.370
That's his ex.

26:42.421 --> 26:44.606
Your ex-girlfriend knows Calista Raines?

26:44.640 --> 26:46.224
That is so cool.

26:46.258 --> 26:48.610
Yeah. It's really cool.

26:51.764 --> 26:53.848
She's out having a good time.

26:53.899 --> 26:57.168
So you should be having one, too.

26:57.203 --> 26:59.437
Yeah, man. You should stay a while.

27:01.340 --> 27:02.507
Come on, everybody! You got a drink?

27:02.541 --> 27:03.691
Let's go!

27:03.726 --> 27:05.009
Whoo!

27:09.649 --> 27:10.982
Mnh.

27:11.016 --> 27:12.767
- Let's have another one.
- Yeah.

27:26.933 --> 27:28.783
Whose house is this?

27:28.834 --> 27:30.535
Someone I met in a chat room.

27:30.537 --> 27:32.437
Since when are you in chat rooms?

27:32.439 --> 27:34.288
Is everyone here a threesome?

27:34.339 --> 27:36.340
Um, there's also some quadros,

27:36.391 --> 27:37.859
and I think that's a quint.

27:37.910 --> 27:39.510
That's one word for it.

27:39.545 --> 27:40.511
Stop judging.

27:40.546 --> 27:41.846
I've been reading all about this.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.114
It's a whole community.

27:43.116 --> 27:44.549
They even have their own language.

27:44.551 --> 27:45.850
I'm a primary.

27:45.884 --> 27:47.869
- You're a freemate.
- And I'm leaving.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.054
Alec, wait. Please, love.

27:50.105 --> 27:51.822
10 minutes.

27:56.278 --> 27:57.962
10 minutes.

27:57.996 --> 28:01.232
I'll get us drinks.

28:03.835 --> 28:05.870
All right, you ready?

28:05.921 --> 28:07.772
Chocolate éclairs, mint gelato,

28:07.806 --> 28:10.324
and my grandma's key lime pie.

28:10.375 --> 28:11.425
Mmm.

28:14.129 --> 28:15.546
Why aren't you eating?

28:15.580 --> 28:16.947
Well, because I'd rather kiss you.

28:18.834 --> 28:21.152
Can I kiss you?

28:30.128 --> 28:31.962
I'll take that as a yes.

28:51.616 --> 28:53.367
Hello?

28:55.320 --> 28:58.489
Yes, of course.

28:58.540 --> 29:01.825
Marc was arrested with the kids.

29:04.306 --> 29:05.489
I swear to you I didn't know

29:05.524 --> 29:06.924
it was a strip club when
I took them in there.

29:06.959 --> 29:08.225
It was just an accident.

29:08.260 --> 29:10.795
You must be starving.
There's plenty left there.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.333
What happened to movies and ice cream?

29:13.335 --> 29:14.501
It was gonna happen, April, I swear,

29:14.535 --> 29:16.203
but I just wanted to show
Lucy your mural first.

29:16.205 --> 29:18.238
And then I got all turned around
'cause it started to get dark,

29:18.272 --> 29:19.806
and I lost my signal, which sucked.

29:19.874 --> 29:21.091
And then both kids had to pee,

29:21.142 --> 29:22.709
and then this sketchy dude
was walking towards us.

29:22.743 --> 29:24.511
- Okay, please stop talking.
- And I didn't want us to get mugged...

29:24.562 --> 29:26.112
- Marc, stop talking!
- Right.

29:26.114 --> 29:28.348
Okay, kids, come on.

29:28.382 --> 29:29.883
Follow me. Let's run baths.

29:29.917 --> 29:32.118
Come on.

29:35.389 --> 29:36.556
Tough night, huh?

29:36.590 --> 29:38.658
I just didn't know that neighborhood

29:38.709 --> 29:40.343
would be so bad, you know?

29:40.394 --> 29:41.528
April didn't need this tonight.

29:41.562 --> 29:42.629
I wouldn't worry about it.

29:42.663 --> 29:44.280
Thanks.

29:44.315 --> 29:45.565
It's natural for people
who don't have children

29:45.599 --> 29:46.966
not to understand what to do with them.

29:46.968 --> 29:48.902
What does that mean, Blair?

29:48.904 --> 29:50.503
It means...

29:50.538 --> 29:52.405
We'll take it from here.

29:57.332 --> 29:59.534
So, I'm dating Mike. He's my primary.

29:59.568 --> 30:01.469
I'm also dating Roy, and he's my secondary,

30:01.503 --> 30:02.920
but Mike and Roy don't date each other,

30:02.955 --> 30:04.338
so they call us a "V."

30:04.356 --> 30:05.606
I'm at the focal point of the relationship,

30:05.641 --> 30:06.924
so I'm the hinge.

30:09.645 --> 30:11.245
It's your turn for the bathroom.

30:14.616 --> 30:16.150
Are you looking for your friends?

30:16.185 --> 30:17.418
They're right over there.

30:19.721 --> 30:21.522
I saw you guys come in together.

30:21.573 --> 30:22.824
Oh.

30:22.858 --> 30:23.791
I'm Karen, by the way.

30:23.842 --> 30:24.976
Mara.

30:25.027 --> 30:26.711
I can tell you haven't
been to many of these.

30:26.745 --> 30:28.346
- You've got that look.
- Is it that obvious?

30:28.397 --> 30:30.631
In my mind, I'm really playing it cool.

30:30.666 --> 30:32.266
In your mind and only in your mind.

30:34.269 --> 30:36.220
Um, how long have you been in the life?

30:36.271 --> 30:38.439
Oh, about seven or eight days.

30:38.473 --> 30:39.974
"Days"?

30:40.008 --> 30:42.076
Uh, I admire your bravery.

30:42.127 --> 30:43.878
It took me years to come out

30:43.912 --> 30:45.913
and feel comfortable with myself.

30:46.044 --> 30:48.996
If I can give you a little advice.

30:49.030 --> 30:51.799
Yes, please. I'm kind of out of my element.

30:51.833 --> 30:52.967
Be careful.

30:53.001 --> 30:54.268
Of what?

30:54.302 --> 30:55.770
Your heart.

30:55.821 --> 30:59.373
This polyamorous stuff can be tricky...

30:59.407 --> 31:00.791
especially when you're the third.

31:00.842 --> 31:02.676
How do you know I'm the third?

31:09.084 --> 31:10.618
Look, I've been where you are.

31:10.685 --> 31:13.587
And I distinctly remember
the pain of feeling,

31:13.638 --> 31:15.189
at the end of the day,

31:15.240 --> 31:17.841
like a guest in their relationship.

31:19.361 --> 31:20.361
Excuse me.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.898
There you are.

31:26.133 --> 31:28.302
We just learned about "cuddle parties."

31:28.336 --> 31:30.270
Oh. Ah, I hate to do this,

31:30.305 --> 31:32.106
but I'm kind of ready to go.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.557
- Oh, thank you, god.
- Oh, me too.

31:33.591 --> 31:35.025
This is all just too bizarre.

31:48.356 --> 31:50.524
â™ª And I see you standing there â™ª

31:50.558 --> 31:54.244
â™ª your half-smile and your "Jimmy D" hair â™ª

31:54.279 --> 31:56.597
â™ª when you were young and free â™ª

31:58.316 --> 32:00.667
â™ª I jump back to another place â™ª

32:00.702 --> 32:02.769
â™ª another time and a younger face â™ª

32:02.804 --> 32:07.040
â™ª and I, I think we could be friends â™ª

32:07.075 --> 32:12.429
â™ª but your star was shining in another time â™ª

32:12.480 --> 32:14.865
â™ª you were swimming with them stars â™ª

32:14.916 --> 32:20.287
â™ª in another life were friends â™ª

32:20.321 --> 32:25.459
â™ª so, don't you fight, my friend â™ª

32:25.493 --> 32:30.263
â™ª it's all right, my man â™ª

32:30.298 --> 32:35.135
â™ª don't you cry no more â™ª

32:35.169 --> 32:39.673
â™ª I'll see you on the other side in time â™ª

32:39.707 --> 32:44.644
â™ª I'll see you on the other side in time â™ª

32:55.957 --> 32:57.490
Oh, I remember this so well.

33:00.227 --> 33:01.795
Uh... you okay?

33:01.829 --> 33:03.163
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:03.197 --> 33:04.497
This is good. This is what I need.

33:04.532 --> 33:06.149
This is good.

33:11.338 --> 33:12.539
Sorry.

33:12.638 --> 33:14.272
Me kissing your ear

33:14.306 --> 33:16.574
has never not turned you on.

33:16.625 --> 33:17.909
Am I doing it wrong?

33:17.960 --> 33:19.010
No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:19.012 --> 33:20.211
You've never done anything wrong

33:20.246 --> 33:21.796
when it comes to my body, I promise.

33:21.831 --> 33:24.148
Okay, 'cause we don't have to
be in this coatroom, you know.

33:24.183 --> 33:25.667
I actually make enough
money to get us a hotel.

33:25.701 --> 33:29.070
While that sounds, oh, so good, I, um...

33:31.006 --> 33:33.224
I'm gonna have to say something to you

33:33.275 --> 33:35.627
that I've never said to you before...

33:35.741 --> 33:36.758
no.

33:36.809 --> 33:38.276
No?

33:38.310 --> 33:39.410
It was so good to see you.

33:39.461 --> 33:41.979
And you look, mmm, so yummy.

33:42.014 --> 33:43.948
I just... I can't.

33:43.950 --> 33:46.150
I love someone else.

33:46.185 --> 33:48.886
Well... So do I.

33:49.001 --> 33:51.519
Really, Brad?

33:51.553 --> 33:53.571
No, no. Just... sorry.

33:56.676 --> 33:58.109
We're not engaged or anything.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.577
Here we go.

33:59.611 --> 34:00.761
Thank you. Thank you.

34:00.812 --> 34:03.948
Thank you.

34:03.950 --> 34:05.049
Wowee.

34:05.083 --> 34:07.285
I want to thank you all for coming.

34:07.319 --> 34:08.252
Kathy Cho?

34:08.286 --> 34:09.553
It is beautiful to look around

34:09.588 --> 34:12.690
and see so many of you
have come out to support...

34:12.741 --> 34:14.158
my new line.

34:16.762 --> 34:21.081
Uh, now, I would like to thank
my lovely wife, Calista...

34:23.368 --> 34:25.835
who believed in my vision

34:25.838 --> 34:29.790
and allowed me this opportunity to shine.

34:32.610 --> 34:33.694
Now, if I could just take a minute

34:33.745 --> 34:34.829
and just tell you about...

34:34.880 --> 34:36.897
Uh, honey, do you want me to do it?

34:36.931 --> 34:39.033
- Hmm?
- Do you want me to do it?

34:39.083 --> 34:40.501
I know... I know this must be hard for you.

34:40.552 --> 34:41.469
- It's okay.
- What?

34:41.503 --> 34:42.485
- It's okay.
- Okay.

34:42.521 --> 34:43.871
- Mnh.
- Here we go.

34:43.905 --> 34:46.223
Something dreadful came to
our attention this morning,

34:46.257 --> 34:49.159
um, and we... and we didn't
want to cancel the party

34:49.194 --> 34:52.295
because we... we wanted to speak out

34:52.347 --> 34:53.864
on the broadest platform we could

34:53.899 --> 34:56.367
to hopefully champion the cause.

34:56.369 --> 35:01.372
You see, our Chinese ambassador
of our little company,

35:01.374 --> 35:03.891
the civil rights guardian in the east,

35:03.942 --> 35:06.210
Lily Wu... thank you...

35:06.244 --> 35:08.946
she informed us that
the factory we were using

35:08.980 --> 35:12.049
is employing underage children.

35:13.785 --> 35:16.920
As you know, this is... this is
something that's near and dear

35:16.955 --> 35:19.456
to our hearts here in the fashion industry,

35:19.491 --> 35:22.826
and this exploitation it must stop.

35:22.877 --> 35:26.530
Luca here is... is
taking full responsibility

35:26.564 --> 35:29.716
for his mistake in picking this factory

35:29.767 --> 35:31.518
and not doing the due diligence

35:31.569 --> 35:33.704
that he normally does

35:33.738 --> 35:36.757
when he's not being an artist and a C.F.O.

35:36.791 --> 35:38.876
It's hard to wear two hats, honey.

35:38.878 --> 35:44.514
So, unfortunately, the
accessories by Luca line

35:44.549 --> 35:46.049
is going to be put on hold

35:46.100 --> 35:48.885
until we find another manufacturer.

35:48.937 --> 35:51.938
But when we do,

35:51.973 --> 35:54.558
all proceeds...

35:54.560 --> 35:56.610
every penny... isn't that right, honey?...

35:56.644 --> 35:58.895
every penny will go to our new foundation

35:58.946 --> 36:01.898
to help victims of labor abuse.

36:01.949 --> 36:03.200
Save the children!

36:03.234 --> 36:05.152
Right?

36:05.203 --> 36:06.653
Yes.

36:06.704 --> 36:08.322
See how much she loves you now.

36:29.057 --> 36:32.075
Hey. Where you going so early?

36:32.110 --> 36:35.045
I have an early shift
at the hospital today.

36:35.079 --> 36:36.313
You gonna go on an empty stomach

36:36.347 --> 36:38.982
and deny yourself Alec's
famous French toast?

36:39.017 --> 36:41.068
What is this about French toast?

36:41.119 --> 36:42.920
And nice try.

36:42.922 --> 36:45.355
Spinach and egg whites for you.

36:45.406 --> 36:47.424
I'm trying to entice Karen
into staying for breakfast,

36:47.458 --> 36:49.192
but I don't think she's
buying what I'm selling.

36:49.227 --> 36:50.644
I have an early shift.

36:50.678 --> 36:53.563
Good. You can meet us for
dinner tonight at Alma.

36:53.598 --> 36:55.732
You're taking us out into the world?

36:55.734 --> 36:57.851
It sounds fun, but I'm
not sure I'm free tonight.

36:57.885 --> 36:59.086
You two go without me.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.924
Karen, something's wrong.

37:00.975 --> 37:04.011
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

37:04.045 --> 37:05.278
You're a terrible liar.

37:08.199 --> 37:10.000
What are we doing?

37:10.051 --> 37:12.386
Okay. Come.

37:12.437 --> 37:15.072
Sit down. Let's talk.

37:15.106 --> 37:17.908
Alec, I think you were right to begin with.

37:17.942 --> 37:20.610
We're flying blind here.

37:20.645 --> 37:23.046
I've never had a relationship

37:23.048 --> 37:25.649
with two single people at the same time,

37:25.651 --> 37:27.484
let alone a married couple.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.438
I have deep feelings for you two,

37:31.489 --> 37:34.875
but if this all falls apart...

37:34.926 --> 37:37.661
who am I kidding?...
when this all falls apart,

37:37.695 --> 37:40.063
you two will still have each other.

37:40.065 --> 37:42.699
But where does that leave me?

37:42.733 --> 37:43.850
Karen.

37:43.901 --> 37:44.818
Oh, honey.

37:44.869 --> 37:46.553
I'll always be the one

37:46.587 --> 37:48.705
who has to knock on the door.

37:58.482 --> 38:00.884
Alec had it made it for you yesterday.

38:00.935 --> 38:02.952
We figured since our house is your house,

38:02.987 --> 38:05.055
you should come and go as you please.

38:05.089 --> 38:07.407
But mostly not go?

38:14.565 --> 38:16.149
Hey, Marc.

38:16.183 --> 38:17.317
How many do you want?

38:17.368 --> 38:19.035
No need to cook for me.

38:19.037 --> 38:20.587
I'm good.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.664
I'm letting Lucy sleep late

38:22.666 --> 38:25.116
after last night's excitement.

38:27.336 --> 38:29.137
Listen, Marc...

38:29.139 --> 38:30.772
What you did last night...

38:30.806 --> 38:32.090
It was stupid. I know.

38:32.124 --> 38:33.708
I never should have put
the kids in that situation.

38:33.742 --> 38:35.660
I was gonna say it was sweet,

38:35.711 --> 38:37.846
you taking Lucy to see my mural.

38:37.897 --> 38:40.148
I get what you were trying
to do, and I appreciate it.

38:40.182 --> 38:41.849
No worries.

38:41.940 --> 38:43.540
You all right?

38:43.591 --> 38:45.175
Yeah. Perfect.

38:47.779 --> 38:49.430
Lucy, would you come here, please?

38:49.481 --> 38:51.732
You don't need to yell,
Mom. I'm right here.

38:51.816 --> 38:54.585
Just get the door, will
you, please, smarty-pants?

38:58.840 --> 39:00.390
Grandma!

39:00.425 --> 39:02.159
Oh, my gosh. I'm so excited.

39:02.210 --> 39:04.945
It was the right thing to do.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.824
Oh, oh, oh.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.809
You were freakin' genius.

39:11.843 --> 39:13.594
Luca's face was priceless.

39:13.645 --> 39:15.079
Hats off to you, lady.

39:15.113 --> 39:16.030
Here.

39:16.081 --> 39:17.515
Thanks.

39:17.549 --> 39:19.316
Yes. Hats off to me.

39:19.367 --> 39:21.218
Mm? Mm.

39:21.253 --> 39:22.670
I'm so sorry.

39:22.721 --> 39:24.188
Why are we not happy dancing right now?

39:24.239 --> 39:27.391
I don't know. I... I stole his line back,

39:27.393 --> 39:31.912
I humiliated him in front of
a large, Twitter-fearing crowd,

39:31.946 --> 39:34.765
and I got his 12-year-old
mistress to leave him.

39:34.816 --> 39:36.433
You'd think I would feel better.

39:38.637 --> 39:40.537
Yeah, well, sometimes hurting someone else

39:40.555 --> 39:42.356
doesn't always take away your own hurt.

39:44.209 --> 39:46.076
Anyway, um, so, what happened

39:46.111 --> 39:47.861
with this, uh, beautiful Brad?

39:47.896 --> 39:51.682
Oh, yes, beautiful, sad, frustrated Brad

39:51.716 --> 39:53.117
didn't get lucky in the coatroom.

39:53.151 --> 39:55.102
What? Why? He was delicious.

39:55.136 --> 39:57.888
Yes, he was, but my heart
still belongs to Harry.

39:57.922 --> 40:01.859
And... I just think that
when you really love someone,

40:01.861 --> 40:03.677
you can't be with anyone else.

40:18.743 --> 40:20.377
Hey.

40:20.411 --> 40:22.312
Wow.

40:22.347 --> 40:24.448
I can hear your thoughts.

40:24.482 --> 40:26.583
You are freaking out right now.

40:26.618 --> 40:29.870
Well, you can stop spinning.

40:29.921 --> 40:32.389
I had a lot of fun last night.

40:32.391 --> 40:34.191
You're amazing, by the way.

40:34.225 --> 40:36.993
But I'm not gonna file
a sexual-harassment suit

40:36.995 --> 40:40.797
or fall in love and start stalking you

40:40.832 --> 40:42.232
or anything like that.

40:42.266 --> 40:45.285
This was definitely a, uh, one-time thing.

40:45.336 --> 40:47.370
I've already got a jealous boyfriend.

40:47.372 --> 40:49.039
You've got a... you've got a boyfriend?

40:49.090 --> 40:51.424
That's... that's interesting.

40:51.476 --> 40:52.425
Yeah.

40:52.477 --> 40:53.510
It's Ellis.

40:56.147 --> 40:57.397
Sorry?

40:57.431 --> 40:59.149
You're, uh...

40:59.183 --> 41:00.984
You're Ellis' girlfriend?

41:01.018 --> 41:03.103
His mistress, actually.
