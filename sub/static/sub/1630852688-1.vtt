00:15.639 --> 00:18.520
I'm Georgina Rodríguez, I'm 27 years old.

00:18.599 --> 00:20.160
Five years ago, my life changed.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.040
¡HOLA! UNCOVERS
CRISTIANO RONALDO'S NEW LOVE

00:23.119 --> 00:25.799
DOES CRISTIANO RONALDO
HAVE A NEW GIRLFRIEND?

00:28.920 --> 00:31.119
GEORGINA DAZZLES IN CANNES

00:32.080 --> 00:34.400
Thanks to love,
my life is now a dream.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.480
WHO IS GEORGINA RODRÍGUEZ?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.199
I went
from selling luxury items

00:46.280 --> 00:48.480
to wearing them on red carpets.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.400
I have millions of followers

00:54.480 --> 00:57.199
and I'm the woman
of the most followed man in the world.

00:57.720 --> 00:58.960
<i>Cristiano kicks…</i>

00:59.040 --> 01:00.480
<i>- Goal!</i>
-  <i>Cristiano!</i>

01:01.720 --> 01:03.400
Many know my name.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.800
Few know who I really am.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.399
I am Georgina.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.160
Georgina! Georgina! Go!

01:13.240 --> 01:15.320
Beautiful! Beautiful. Beautiful.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.040
Nothing in life has come easy.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.920
I would have liked
to invite Mom and Dad over.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.960
But you couldn't at that moment.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.720
Yes.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.759
The life story she has,
her story with her family,

01:36.839 --> 01:38.399
is very similar to mine.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.880
Hi! Are you going to follow me all day
with that little camera?

01:43.880 --> 01:45.720
I don't consider myself a phenomenon

01:45.800 --> 01:48.000
but I do consider myself
a fortunate woman.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.080
My loves,
how have you been today?

01:51.160 --> 01:54.759
Because I know what it is to have nothing,
and I know what is to have everything.

02:00.039 --> 02:01.520
- So?
- I love it.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.759
I have to decide.

02:02.839 --> 02:04.960
Man, I'm clear about it.
You already know.

02:05.039 --> 02:06.479
She has to wear Jean Paul.

02:10.799 --> 02:14.799
- Olé!

02:14.880 --> 02:16.360
- Go!
- Yeah!

02:19.799 --> 02:21.040
- Olé! Yeah!
- Bravo!

02:30.799 --> 02:32.440
My life was built,

02:32.519 --> 02:35.600
and today is still built,
on the basis of love.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.080
That's when I went in and Gio was there.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.760
She was already done with work.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.959
And that's the first time I saw her.

02:44.799 --> 02:46.560
- Kiss.
<i>- Honey, I'll call you later.</i>

02:46.640 --> 02:47.560
<i>Okay.</i>

02:48.519 --> 02:50.040
Aw!

02:51.799 --> 02:55.519
God always accompanied me
and gave me the strength to fight…

02:56.440 --> 02:58.640
"Georgina, you're a person
with a big heart."

02:58.720 --> 03:01.040
"I wish there were more people
like you in the world."

03:01.920 --> 03:04.239
…to guide me towards
what was good for me.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.440
The wedding? The wedding?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.280
- Guess a date.
- Doesn't depend on me. I wish!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.880
Georgina is the woman
of my life, obviously.

03:10.959 --> 03:13.440
She's the woman
I'm completely in love with.

03:22.399 --> 03:23.880
TO MY LOVE WITH LOVE

03:24.720 --> 03:26.600
The day I met Cristiano,

03:27.519 --> 03:29.440
it was a Thursday, in summer.

03:34.239 --> 03:35.320
I'm on my way to work

03:35.399 --> 03:38.119
on Cartagena Street,
and Ortega and Gasset.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.280
I get to Gucci, as usual.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.600
I was off at 5:00 in the afternoon.

03:47.040 --> 03:52.600
And a colleague calls me and says,
"Hey, Gio, I'm on vacation, but listen."

03:53.840 --> 03:56.440
"There's a client
who's going to buy some coats."

03:56.519 --> 03:59.440
"Please stay half an hour
and take care of her."

04:02.079 --> 04:03.760
And when I'm leaving the store…

04:06.679 --> 04:08.720
I see a very handsome man appear,

04:09.320 --> 04:10.799
almost two meters tall.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.959
He was with a boy and some friends.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.320
And I stand frozen.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.519
Júnior stands in front of me,

04:19.039 --> 04:21.519
very well behaved, he greets me.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.760
So it was funny, you know? "Ha ha."

04:25.280 --> 04:28.560
Like the kid had said hi to me,
of course to a young girl, pretty.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.720
I started feeling butterflies
in my stomach, and said,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.120
"Huh, what's going on with me?"

04:34.200 --> 04:37.160
So I didn't even want to look at him.
I was very shy.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.080
And that's when I went in
and Gio was there.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.039
She was already done with work.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.760
And it was like…

04:47.840 --> 04:50.160
…a moment that…

04:50.720 --> 04:53.680
What's the word for it? It was…
We clicked.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.479
And that's when
she got stuck in my head.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.800
That's the pure truth.

05:01.840 --> 05:02.680
SERRANO STREET

05:02.760 --> 05:05.360
I started taking care of him
at Gucci, and he wrote one day

05:05.440 --> 05:08.640
to say he was going to an event,
asking if I'd be there.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.599
And I said, "Oh, well, yes."
"I'm also invited, I'll stop by."

05:13.120 --> 05:16.560
And I spent all day thinking
which outfit I was going to wear.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.160
"How will I do my hair?"

05:18.240 --> 05:20.840
When I got there, he looked very handsome.

05:20.919 --> 05:24.280
I remember perfectly how he was dressed,
how I was dressed.

05:24.919 --> 05:27.039
Nothing… We toasted a little champagne.

05:28.479 --> 05:31.400
Then I had to go
to the company dinner that very same day.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.680
I didn't feel like going
to the company dinner at all,

05:35.200 --> 05:37.560
but it was good
because it left us wanting more.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.919
Little by little, we started talking more,
and things went in a more natural way.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.560
It wasn't sudden…

05:49.039 --> 05:50.080
because…

05:52.200 --> 05:55.120
it took a bit, perhaps a couple of months.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.080
It was during that time
that we kind of stopped seeing each other.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.120
He had a lot of games, the national team…

06:04.800 --> 06:07.039
The thing with my father
also happened then.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.560
For a bit, I was a little absent, a bit--
Well, I was sad.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.720
And one day, we ran into each other
at another event.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.440
He was there with his friends,
and his brother, Hugo.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.840
And he says,
"Gio, do you want to come for dinner?"

06:22.680 --> 06:25.240
I said, "Finally!" "The chance has come."

06:26.720 --> 06:31.120
Things really started to get more intense
when we ran into each other at that event.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.120
We talked a little more,
then I invited her to dinner,

06:35.680 --> 06:37.400
and my brother was with me too.

06:38.039 --> 06:39.520
And she agreed to come to dinner.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.799
And I was really excited.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.240
So, on the way

06:45.080 --> 06:47.880
to the restaurant,
our hands brushed each other's.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.280
And it felt
as if his hands had been with me

06:53.240 --> 06:54.840
many times before.

06:54.919 --> 06:57.440
And once our hands had brushed
by accident,

06:57.520 --> 06:59.640
we went for it and held them together.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.280
When our hands brushed…

07:02.880 --> 07:03.840
…um,

07:05.640 --> 07:07.720
it was a moment, um,

07:08.640 --> 07:09.799
that was unique.

07:10.799 --> 07:12.359
His hands felt familiar.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.400
They fit perfectly.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.239
We went out for dinner.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
Then I went home.

07:19.359 --> 07:22.640
I had to work early,
he had early practice, a game--

07:22.719 --> 07:26.840
No, not a game because he never has dinner
before a game. He had practice.

07:26.919 --> 07:28.680
So he dropped me off at home,

07:28.760 --> 07:31.200
and my heart was going,
"Boom-boom, boom-boom."

07:38.919 --> 07:43.200
The most special moment was the Saturday
when he played against Athletic.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.440
I mean, I was dying to see him
and be with him,

07:46.520 --> 07:48.280
but I didn't want to reach out.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.320
What could I comment on?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.120
So he writes to me after the game.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.760
And he says, "How are you? Where are you?"

07:56.560 --> 07:59.359
And I'm thinking,
"If I told you that I'm at home

07:59.440 --> 08:04.080
with everything ready, cleaned,
groceries, shopping, the uniform clean,

08:04.159 --> 08:06.560
showered and sitting here
waiting for you?"

08:06.640 --> 08:10.440
So I respond, "Nothing. I'm at home…"
"…I was going to bed."

08:10.520 --> 08:12.599
And he goes, "Do you want to have dinner?"

08:12.679 --> 08:16.039
I said, "Okay." Even though I had dinner
a couple of hours ago.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.719
I said, "Okay, yes, let's have dinner,"
and he picked me up after the game.

08:20.799 --> 08:22.479
I lived on the first floor,

08:22.560 --> 08:23.919
and, um…

08:24.000 --> 08:27.400
And I would open my windows
after scrubbing so it would dry quicker.

08:27.479 --> 08:31.200
Then, suddenly, I heard the engine
and I thought, "He's here."

08:31.280 --> 08:34.159
So I went out super happy
with my little backpack.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.280
I had to wake up early the next morning.
I had to go to work.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.440
I got to his place
and he had his mashed potatoes, his…

08:40.520 --> 08:44.840
his veggies, his chicken,
and I had dinner again, like a lady.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.640
She was a very interesting girl,

08:49.720 --> 08:51.880
much more mature for her age, really.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Uh, we have a bit of an age difference.

08:55.079 --> 08:56.840
And I started to get hooked.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.600
Um, it kept me interested.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.040
Many times he'd come after work
and I'd get out at 10:00 at night.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.280
He would come, um…

09:07.959 --> 09:10.280
I remember once--
once in a Bugatti.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.680
My coworkers went crazy.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.280
They'd get there on the bus,
and I would leave in a Bugatti.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.199
I mean, people couldn't believe it.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.800
To me, it was "normal," quote-unquote.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.680
Uh, because she was already my girlfriend.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.959
I know the cars I have,
so I'm not gonna pick her up in a taxi.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.079
But it was funny because
I would wait for her outside the store,

09:31.720 --> 09:34.320
with these flashy cars that I have.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.400
She's really good in that sense.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.160
She'd leave the store quickly,
get in the car, and we'd go home.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.839
She also gets out a little late from work.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.400
We would go home, and there,
we'd go into our own "world."

09:49.800 --> 09:53.400
We had… we had a very special start
to our relationship.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.720
Very nice.

09:55.959 --> 09:59.040
I didn't think at the beginning
that it would be this strong.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.880
That I would fall in love with her.
I… I didn't expect it, honestly.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.240
But after a while, I felt that…

10:07.480 --> 10:09.199
that she <i>was </i>the woman of my life.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.560
TURIN, ITALY

10:22.120 --> 10:24.400
- Yes, that's--
- That's reality.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.920
- Hi!
- Good morning. How are you?

10:28.000 --> 10:28.959
How are you?

10:30.240 --> 10:32.240
To me, the best part of traveling,

10:33.440 --> 10:34.800
in Cris's jet,

10:34.880 --> 10:36.880
is its crew, no doubt.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.160
And the jet does really
make life much easier.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.000
And if I had to be in an airport
for two hours with Cristiano,

10:43.079 --> 10:43.920
I'd go insane.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.600
I mean, I couldn't go.
I'd rather not travel.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.120
Do you want me to take one of you
looking at me while you go up?

10:50.199 --> 10:51.560
- No, without.
- Okay.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.480
- Perhaps over there, or what?
- Yes.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.680
Because the light is hitting me
from over there.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.040
I always try to bring
some of my friends on every trip

11:01.120 --> 11:03.800
so that they can experience
a little of what my life is.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.880
I like to share it.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.680
- Do you want to take a picture?
- Yes.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.320
This is the best angle.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.560
Here. She can stay here.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.800
People always ask me,

11:13.880 --> 11:16.959
"Uh, well, she must have
a bunch of photographers, and whatnot?"

11:17.040 --> 11:19.280
And I say,
"People are not going to believe it,

11:19.360 --> 11:22.839
but Gio doesn't have any photographers
and she doesn't edit her photos."

11:25.800 --> 11:27.400
- Let the power shine.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.440
GOOD MORNING, PARIS

11:36.839 --> 11:40.160
Not that. More like that.
A bit more from there, no?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.839
If I'm there, I'll take the photo.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.560
If Júnior's there, he'll take photos
of her that are amazing.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.440
So it's Júnior, or whoever is there.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.120
- At the count of three, okay?
- Okay.

11:50.199 --> 11:51.719
One, two, three.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.640
Okay, there's too much sun. That's it.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.560
I'm going to Paris to Jean Paul's atelier,

12:06.640 --> 12:10.560
because, um, I'm getting ready
for the Cannes Film Festival,

12:10.640 --> 12:12.160
and so I'm looking for a dress.

12:15.079 --> 12:16.839
Cheers, dear.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.760
All natural, nothing artificial.

12:18.839 --> 12:19.959
No plastic.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.280
Here it is.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.600
- Wow!
- The color's even prettier.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.920
Yes, it didn't look as pretty
in the picture.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.199
Elena is one of my best friends.

12:41.280 --> 12:46.599
She helps me a lot with the outfits,
the kids, with everything.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.120
And we understand each other perfectly.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.280
When I have to travel,

12:52.360 --> 12:54.480
it motivates me to know
that I have the catering

12:54.560 --> 12:56.480
- that Rebeca prepares.
- Rebeca's the best.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.040
Rebeca, we're talking about the meals
you always choose to make for us.

13:00.599 --> 13:03.520
- Oh, thank you very much.
- It's the best part of the flight.

13:03.599 --> 13:06.599
Well, the best part of the flight
are you guys, the crew.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.160
- Thank you.
- But I say,

13:08.240 --> 13:10.560
it's probably what motivates me most.

13:12.120 --> 13:16.760
Rebeca has a nice catering setup,
where they make an amazing potato tortilla

13:16.839 --> 13:18.839
and the Iberian cold meats I like.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.760
She prepares everything with care.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.760
This one is great.

13:23.839 --> 13:25.240
It's the best of the tapas.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.199
I'm going to get to Jean Paul
with a waist eight sizes bigger.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.400
We'll tell them,
"Then you get rid of two centimeters."

13:34.240 --> 13:37.440
- Plus, you lose weight in summer.
- <i>You</i> do!

13:37.520 --> 13:40.040
- Not me. No, no.
- No?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.680
But you always sweat more, I mean.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.280
I don't sweat. Right?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.719
I<i> do </i>sweat from the heat.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.760
Plus, in summertime, on vacation,
you eat like I eat.

13:50.839 --> 13:53.760
- Okay, right, it's true--
- Although, if it was for the food,

13:53.839 --> 13:56.839
I'd be on vacation all year round
because I eat.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.560
I'm a sight to see.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.800
The lady is healthy.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.800
Gio doesn't trust people
who don't eat.

14:01.880 --> 14:02.959
Well, yes.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.120
I also eat a lot and people would tell me,
"Why don't you fast some day?"

14:07.199 --> 14:08.400
And I tell them, "Me?"

14:08.480 --> 14:10.920
"With all the energy
I need to face the day."

14:11.000 --> 14:13.400
I get energy from food, period.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.920
Ramón is one of my agents.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.839
He reached out to me
when I started dating Cristiano.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.719
Many agencies got in touch with me.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.640
We agreed to meet for coffee,
near my house, on America Avenue.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.479
We have a connection
and a good vibe still today.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.760
I love working with him
and I hope we'll work for many years.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.000
Georgina, at a personal level, is great,

14:36.760 --> 14:39.839
because she's not an egocentric person.

14:40.599 --> 14:42.599
She will ask about me, you know?

14:43.560 --> 14:47.760
She'll ask about my nephews,
she'll ask me about, um, you know…

14:47.839 --> 14:49.560
She's really very personable.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.120
I guess that's another of Gio's charms.

14:56.599 --> 14:59.880
PARIS, FRANCE

15:03.000 --> 15:05.400
- Paris brings back such nice memories.
- Yes.

15:05.479 --> 15:07.520
- Why?
- It was my first trip with Cris.

15:07.599 --> 15:10.479
Oh, that's right. This is where you went
to Euro Disney, no?

15:10.560 --> 15:11.439
Yes.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.959
I remembered…

15:15.640 --> 15:19.120
the first time I set foot
in that romantic city.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.560
- How was that? Do tell.
- Yes.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.719
He was in disguise.

15:24.439 --> 15:27.360
- It was completely useless.
- Where did you buy the wig?

15:27.439 --> 15:28.880
I don't know. They took care of it.

15:35.959 --> 15:39.079
I had some wigs in Madrid,
made of real hair.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.120
I mean, the wig's hair is better
than mine. Really.

15:42.199 --> 15:44.719
It's really good, and I said, "Okay."

15:45.319 --> 15:46.719
"I'm gonna take the risk."

15:47.280 --> 15:49.199
"I'll wear the wig, the scarf,

15:50.160 --> 15:51.520
a pair of sun glasses,

15:51.599 --> 15:53.120
and let's go to Disneyland."

15:53.199 --> 15:55.240
A jacket. Like this. Big.

15:55.319 --> 15:58.079
- Wearing the wig wasn't your idea?
- No.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.680
As if! I didn't even know
the paparazzi existed in this world.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.439
I didn't know of their existence
or their profession.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.439
And we get to a place,
I don't remember where we were,

16:08.520 --> 16:09.400
we were going--

16:09.479 --> 16:11.120
We were like this, and the wig--

16:11.199 --> 16:14.280
It's flying backwards
as if it was coming off.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.040
I was like this trying to hold it
and whatnot.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.479
The people underneath were staring at me.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.439
I mean, waiting to see anything.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.599
The wig comes off, and I go,
"Well, they're gonna catch me."

16:24.680 --> 16:25.560
"It's over."

16:25.640 --> 16:26.640
I put it on and…

16:27.280 --> 16:28.160
then the scarf…

16:28.240 --> 16:30.640
And this here…
…I have my Dad's neck.

16:30.719 --> 16:33.959
A tall neck, and this really sticks out.

16:35.319 --> 16:38.719
So people started talking,
"It's Cristiano. It's Cristiano."

16:38.800 --> 16:40.959
Then they start talking, and smile.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.280
Because people who really know me
are hard to fool.

16:44.359 --> 16:46.359
You have to be in very good disguise.

16:47.479 --> 16:49.520
- But they recognized him.
- Yes.

16:49.599 --> 16:50.959
Children recognized him.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.560
And he was wearing a wig,
wearing my scarf,

16:53.640 --> 16:56.000
but because of the jaw
and the Adam's apple?

16:56.079 --> 16:57.079
- Wow.
- It shows.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.199
It's just that the kids know him so well--

16:59.280 --> 17:01.240
They like football a lot here too, right?

17:01.719 --> 17:03.400
If I had to do it again,
I would do it again

17:03.479 --> 17:05.119
because they're moments

17:05.200 --> 17:06.839
that make you be a kid again.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.640
I mean, it's those little things,
like hiding…

17:09.720 --> 17:11.079
I don't know, it's school stuff.

17:11.159 --> 17:15.319
The first kiss with your girlfriend,
then hiding so your friends don't see.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.800
And I enjoyed it because of that,

17:17.880 --> 17:20.440
because it was with a girl
that I was falling in love with.

17:21.319 --> 17:22.319
We were like friends.

17:22.399 --> 17:24.839
I'm telling you,
it was a spectacular story

17:24.919 --> 17:26.480
that I remember now,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.560
and one of the most beautiful moments
Gio has shared with me.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.800
And in the initial process
of a relationship,

17:34.880 --> 17:37.159
those moments are unforgettable.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.760
Alba, the stylist,
is already there waiting for us.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.200
And Gregory. They're the ones
who're expecting us.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.640
They're going to open the atelier
of Jean Paul Gaultier

17:48.720 --> 17:50.840
so we can find the dress for Cannes.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.640
Most probably, you will try things on,

17:53.720 --> 17:56.320
but they'll take your measurements
and make a replica of the dress

17:56.399 --> 17:58.120
that's iconic of the brand.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.280
- Okay.
- Whichever one you like best.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.280
Perhaps you don't know this, but it's
Jean Paul Gaultier's birthday today,

18:03.360 --> 18:05.080
so maybe that's why
he wasn't able to come.

18:05.159 --> 18:06.320
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

18:06.399 --> 18:07.800
Darn, what a coincidence.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.000
Well, if I had known,
I would have brought him a present.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.760
You tell me now, Ramón!
Two minutes before we get there.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.760
I could have brought him
a bit of ham or pork loin.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.120
A bit of ham?
I even have some on the plane.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.919
- I would have set aside some <i>ibéricos.</i>
- Wow.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.720
And he said, "I'm a vegetarian."

18:30.480 --> 18:32.040
- Gregory.
- Hi.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.640
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

18:33.720 --> 18:34.919
Good.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.640
- Hi. Greg.
- Hello!

18:36.720 --> 18:39.040
- How are you? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.000
- Hi, Georgina.
- Hi.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.280
- Welcome to Jean Paul Gaultier…
- Nice to meet you.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.280
…and sunny Paris.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.720
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.159
Hi.

18:53.159 --> 18:54.000
Wow!

19:00.840 --> 19:04.159
Jean Paul's atelier is
a space filled with art.

19:04.720 --> 19:05.679
It's incredible.

19:09.880 --> 19:13.080
Here you have a mix
of the Spring Summer 20 collection,

19:13.159 --> 19:15.000
the last couture collection by Gaultier.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.960
- And archive pieces as well.
- Wow.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.280
It's an honor to be here.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.080
Gorgeous, huh?

19:27.080 --> 19:28.960
I wanted to go to the atelier

19:29.040 --> 19:32.760
to have the chance to touch and see
in person all of his designs.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.399
This is, uh, Lady Gaga.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.560
- Wow!
- In the "G.U.Y." video.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.679
Oh, yes.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.040
She had the big feather head piece
on top.

19:41.960 --> 19:46.520
This was one of Naomi Campbell's
first looks back in the…

19:47.280 --> 19:48.360
…2000s.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.399
This could be, like,
museum pieces more than…

19:52.480 --> 19:56.520
Yes. Actually, it came back
from a museum recently.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.880
I have no words to describe
that building with those chandeliers,

20:01.960 --> 20:04.040
those wonderful staircases,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.760
those high-end outfits
which celebrities have worn.

20:07.560 --> 20:11.480
I thought it was magical to be able
to go to the Jean Paul Gaultier atelier.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.679
Okay, let's try.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.360
Make yourself at home.

20:16.159 --> 20:19.120
I love this one.
It's a style I don't wear much.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.360
I'm not sure about the color for July…

20:21.440 --> 20:23.240
- Okay.
- But it's wonderful.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.120
Because for Cannes in July,
maybe it's okay.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.760
Right, this dress belonged to,
I mean--

20:28.840 --> 20:32.200
They made a replica for a…
high-end client…

20:32.280 --> 20:34.880
- And she died, because otherwise…
- Oh!

20:34.960 --> 20:37.320
- She had the exclusivity.
- Right.

20:37.399 --> 20:39.080
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

20:40.159 --> 20:45.800
Fashion is art, creativity. It's illusion.
It's femininity, masculinity.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.280
Beauty.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.600
- Beautiful!
- Wow!

20:52.640 --> 20:54.760
Wow, it looks like it was made to fit you.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.000
Yes, it looks good, honestly.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.760
- How does it feel?
- Very good.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.560
Right, what I like
about this dress is that it gives you--

21:01.640 --> 21:03.840
- This is gorgeous.
- Yes. Exactly.

21:03.919 --> 21:05.840
Helen, what do you think of this?

21:05.919 --> 21:08.880
Because without this, look,
you can see the whole corset,

21:08.960 --> 21:10.919
and the whole shape, like this.

21:11.679 --> 21:13.760
I think l like it more without it.

21:14.679 --> 21:16.679
- It's beautiful.
- Happy?

21:16.760 --> 21:17.679
- Yes.

21:17.760 --> 21:18.960
First love.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
I love fashion. I live fashion.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.040
Do you like it?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.240
- It makes your ass look great.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.399
So you can see the back part. Wow!

21:35.000 --> 21:38.080
I would like this if it had less volume.

21:38.159 --> 21:39.280
But…

21:40.040 --> 21:42.159
- Let's try another one.
- Do you like?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.760
I feel like I'm living a dream.

21:59.320 --> 22:03.520
I had seen superstars so many times
with their designs,

22:03.600 --> 22:06.960
and to be able to touch them,
well, it's still

22:08.399 --> 22:09.840
hard to assimilate.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.360
Well, today's been a great day, dear.

22:18.439 --> 22:20.159
It's been a fantasy, huh?

22:20.240 --> 22:21.200
I'll say.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.919
Every time I have an engagement,

22:25.600 --> 22:28.120
I try to take care of it all the same day.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.320
I leave in the morning,
return in the afternoon or at night,

22:31.399 --> 22:34.159
so I can wake up
and make sure my kids are all right.

22:34.679 --> 22:36.640
And greet them good morning.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.240
I get a message from Cris
just as I'm landing.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.560
He says, "Are you landing?"

22:46.640 --> 22:50.960
Who knows better than him
because he had just seen his plane.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.520
So, I tell him, "Yes, we're just landing."
He goes, "Okay, I'm arriving."

23:01.600 --> 23:03.360
- How are you?
- Well, and you?

23:03.439 --> 23:05.120
- How did it go?
- Well.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.919
- Yes?
- Yes, very well.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.720
Hello, how are you?

23:09.520 --> 23:10.880
- What a coincidence.
- Yes.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.000
Did you see us land?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.080
I was just looking.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.399
And it takes an hour or so to get here
from Paris.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.159
- Yes.
- I was looking and just then…

23:18.240 --> 23:20.560
You were coming in and I saw you land.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.880
She was online.

23:22.880 --> 23:26.560
Coincidentally, this is the first time
we've run into each other at the airport.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.120
- So, all is well, right?
- Yes, it was really fun.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.840
All right, darling…

23:31.919 --> 23:34.679
Yes, I'm going to pick up
the little crazies now.

23:35.399 --> 23:39.040
It made me so sad this morning. Poor kids.
They came downstairs with me.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.720
Right, with me.
It was as if I was the Dad who--

23:41.800 --> 23:42.960
Yes!

23:43.040 --> 23:45.360
- Nothing. It was nice. It was nice.
- They're so crazy.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.439
All right, dear, we'll speak later.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.840
- Okay.
- Bye.

23:48.919 --> 23:51.200
- Okay, speak later.
- Cheers. Good luck, Cris.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.800
I find the tranquility I need at home
with Cris, and our children.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.399
- Sweeties! Whoo!
- Hi!

24:05.480 --> 24:06.800
My sweethearts.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.280
Did… did you bring us a surprise?

24:10.040 --> 24:11.679
- I want to see!
- Yes, my love.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.000
- Kinder eggs!
- Sweethearts.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.760
How have you been today?

24:18.640 --> 24:21.560
Give Mom a kiss. Come on, a kiss.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.600
Mommy! Mommy, I gave Alana a kiss.

24:25.679 --> 24:27.280
Yes? Very good.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.960
More Kinder eggs!

24:37.760 --> 24:42.679
MADRID, SPAIN
FAMILY HOME

24:52.840 --> 24:55.159
The first time
I came to Cristiano's house…

24:55.720 --> 24:57.360
Well, I'd get lost.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.399
I'd want to go to the kitchen to get water
and I had no idea where to go.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.040
Sometimes it would take me
half an hour to get to the living room

25:05.120 --> 25:06.960
because I didn't know the way back.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.880
It was so big.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.760
Since I was a kid,
I've been used to living

25:10.840 --> 25:12.560
in really small apartments.

25:12.640 --> 25:16.159
Sure, you get here and--
I had no idea, I mean, I didn't know.

25:16.919 --> 25:18.880
I think that after half a year here,

25:18.960 --> 25:21.919
I was able to know where everything was
and it was okay.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.840
- Hello, dear. How are you? Okay?
- Hi!

25:33.480 --> 25:36.120
Paula Brito is our preferred
interior decorator.

25:36.199 --> 25:38.080
A hardworking woman I love.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.399
Well, they're turning in the project
for construction.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.919
- Yes, yes.
- So…

25:43.000 --> 25:46.040
it'll be ready at the end of--
No, beginning of June.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.000
I called Paula because
I want to redecorate the big house,

25:50.919 --> 25:54.280
and I want to reuse the furniture
and take them to the small house.

25:55.439 --> 25:57.360
And since she was the one who got them,

25:57.439 --> 26:00.520
she can facilitate transport
and the setup.

26:01.399 --> 26:04.120
The furniture doesn't match
the decoration that I want.

26:04.640 --> 26:08.399
So it makes me really sad 'cause
we also got them three years ago, right?

26:08.480 --> 26:10.960
- Yes, three years. Four years.
- I'd like to reuse them.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.399
- The house next door.
- Yes, in the Finca.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.439
The house next door is practically empty.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.199
- We were just renting it so that's it…
- Yes.

26:18.679 --> 26:22.439
I can tell her, "I need this house
to be more homogeneous."

26:22.520 --> 26:25.240
"Don't mix patterns
with marble, with lights."

26:25.320 --> 26:28.199
"Don't get plastic flowers,
don't get me books."

26:28.280 --> 26:31.080
"Not too many things
as to not dust things too much."

26:32.399 --> 26:34.399
So, I thought the lamp for sure,

26:34.480 --> 26:37.199
and your men would have to come
and move it with lots of love.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.520
Yes, to get it out.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.240
This stone? Did you say it comes
with the frame, or without?

26:41.320 --> 26:43.640
- Without.
- It all comes off, stone and frame?

26:43.720 --> 26:46.040
- We'll have to see.
- Can we re-use the frame, or not?

26:46.120 --> 26:47.560
Yes, we can use it.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.080
Okay, the chairs. These.
You would use these chairs.

26:56.159 --> 26:59.560
These… Um, we'll upholster them.
This one too.

27:01.159 --> 27:03.120
- The rug? No.
- Um, no.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.320
- I'd do the rug in another color--
- Because the wool…

27:06.399 --> 27:07.919
the wool is lighter.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.520
Cheap. And cheap.
I don't want to ruin the cashmere.

27:13.320 --> 27:14.960
Since I became a mother,

27:15.040 --> 27:17.760
I have to think kids
when choosing anything.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.520
In Turin, in fact, I had a cashmere rug,

27:22.480 --> 27:23.360
and wool.

27:23.439 --> 27:26.120
So on the first dinner,
they were having strawberries.

27:26.199 --> 27:27.600
The strawberries fell.

27:28.199 --> 27:29.880
And the stain stayed.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.399
Since this table is good, it's Armani,
I want to put it…

27:34.080 --> 27:36.360
There's a huge room downstairs
that's completely empty.

27:36.439 --> 27:38.880
It's about, let's say,
this whole space empty.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.320
- Okay? Okay.
- Three twenty.

27:40.919 --> 27:43.280
It has to be five by five to give it room.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.760
Okay, it doesn't fit.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.000
- The mattress. Do we take it?
- Uh, I'll leave it.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.120
You'll leave it?

27:49.199 --> 27:52.240
Yes, because I could get
a cheaper mattress. There.

27:52.320 --> 27:55.840
- Yes, there's this topper, right?
- No, plus it's new.

27:55.919 --> 27:57.199
You just brought it.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.320
- It's very good.
- Yes, I'll keep that for the kids.

28:00.399 --> 28:02.840
- For when the bedroom's done.
- We won't take anything from here.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.360
As a professional,
Paula is very upbeat, she's very fun.

28:07.439 --> 28:08.880
She understands my needs.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.240
- You have to measure it.
- But where would you put it?

28:12.320 --> 28:15.360
One and--
Let's go check the house. One thirty.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.280
Two seventy-five.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.840
- Everything here is extra large.
- Okay.

28:19.919 --> 28:22.679
No, it's going to be impossible
to take it.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.399
- It weighs too much.
- It's heavy.

28:25.199 --> 28:26.320
What shall we do with it?

28:26.399 --> 28:27.880
Let's sell it online.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.800
- That's true.
- You can get 10,000 euros.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.280
Oh, okay, everything I don't keep,
we'll sell.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.560
Now, to do the redecoration
of the big house,

28:35.640 --> 28:38.600
there's a lot of huge,
tailor-made furniture we won't use,

28:38.679 --> 28:41.640
and I can't put them in
the smaller house.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.120
I've asked her for a favor.

28:44.199 --> 28:46.399
If she knows any websites
where we can sell them,

28:46.480 --> 28:47.560
because, honestly,

28:47.639 --> 28:50.040
I've a bunch of friends
who always buy secondhand

28:50.120 --> 28:51.439
when they need furniture.

28:52.840 --> 28:56.639
The downside of this furniture
is that they don't fit in every house.

28:56.720 --> 29:00.679
So I assume there's an application
to sell bigger, high-end furniture.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.840
I can't put this on Wallapop, for example.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.480
I'll get more fabric.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.040
This one looks like a flea market.

29:15.639 --> 29:17.919
- It's for summer.
- Paula, what do you think?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.800
- The three bedrooms the same?
- No, different.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.480
- Different weaves?
- Look at this color.

29:23.159 --> 29:24.439
- This green one.
- Yes.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.919
- This is the one I like.
- That's super elegant.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.080
One in pink, the other one green,
one in blue.

29:31.199 --> 29:35.199
And one for… for the main bedroom.
I thought of maroon which is very sensual.

29:36.199 --> 29:39.480
Here's a color you'll like then.
This is Dedar and Hermès.

29:44.679 --> 29:47.879
To me, the color of each element
is very important,

29:47.959 --> 29:51.399
because you can't have the same decoration
in your lounging room

29:51.480 --> 29:53.240
as in the activity room.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.520
For blue,
this color is really nice, right?

29:57.040 --> 29:58.720
- I like!
- This one's nice for the headboard.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.399
This one with the white
or this one that's more beige?

30:01.480 --> 30:04.080
This beige one is the same as the others.

30:04.159 --> 30:06.959
This is the color
because it has a lot of white or…

30:07.040 --> 30:10.560
- Do you like this one?
- I, uh… Wait… There's this one.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.919
I like this one a lot.
Like a bit earthy white.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.240
Well, we're all set.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.959
- Let's go to the house.
- I know which one.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.840
We'll see what inspires us most.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.120
Okay, so tell me.
What's your plan for tomorrow?

30:29.199 --> 30:31.399
<i>Um, I'm going out with my girlfriend.</i>

30:31.480 --> 30:33.800
So, do you want me
to prepare you some snacks?

30:33.879 --> 30:35.560
I can put together a high tea.

30:35.639 --> 30:38.600
The mom has to give her seal of approval
'cause I'll be a mother-in-law.

30:38.679 --> 30:40.120
He's making me a mother-in-law.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.040
I think it's funny
that Júnior has a girlfriend.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.320
I've told him I have to meet her.
And that I have to approve.

30:47.919 --> 30:52.360
Well, although I won't be a mother-in-law
who's nosy, not really.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.199
Kisses. He's already…
he's already getting girlfriends.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.639
Youth! They start pretty early.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.520
- They're not babies and want girlfriends.
- Yes, yes, yes.

31:06.399 --> 31:11.760
TURIN, ITALY
GEORGINA AND CRISTIANO'S HOUSE

31:23.840 --> 31:25.639
What else do you have to take?

31:26.399 --> 31:28.879
I have to take everything
in this box.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.800
Júnior plays in Juventus.

31:39.879 --> 31:42.879
When I see Júnior play football,
I see his father.

31:42.959 --> 31:44.720
He has the same personality.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.000
He's so proud of him.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.639
Every time he sees his dad
do something new in a game,

31:53.719 --> 31:56.760
he watches it later on YouTube,
and imitates him and practices.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.280
He goes out to the patio
at home and does it.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.719
Otherwise, he'll do it in the living room

32:01.800 --> 32:03.959
but I've told him be careful
with the lamps and crystals

32:04.040 --> 32:05.159
which are very dangerous.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.159
- Okay, you play against?
- Milan.

32:11.399 --> 32:13.280
Let's see how many goals
you make today.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.360
I made three in the last one, I think.

32:15.439 --> 32:17.240
- Hmm.
- But we lost.

32:18.840 --> 32:19.760
Six to five.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.080
Well, today you know what to do
when you score.

32:23.159 --> 32:24.800
What are you going to do?

32:26.120 --> 32:27.240
G, for your name.

32:27.959 --> 32:31.320
Yes, I love that he dedicates goals to me.
Him and his father.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.840
- And "Gorgeous."

32:34.760 --> 32:36.360
So, you're laughing, huh?

32:37.639 --> 32:39.320
What do you think the score will be?

32:40.320 --> 32:41.679
Today, I say…

32:44.120 --> 32:45.399
Juve, six,

32:45.480 --> 32:46.679
Milan, two.

32:47.439 --> 32:48.280
What?

32:48.919 --> 32:53.360
No? I mean, when I used to go see you,
you guys used to score like 14 goals.

32:53.879 --> 32:55.719
No, we lost when you came.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.800
- Against them?
- Six to five.

32:57.879 --> 33:00.840
- Well, but you'll win this year.
- Yes.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.760
Júnior wants to be like his father.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.600
He admires his father a lot and…

33:06.520 --> 33:10.760
Imagine being a football player
and your dad is the best one in the world.

33:11.439 --> 33:13.360
Well, it's that.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.879
Cristianito has the conditions,
he has potential.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.679
He has everything to dedicate himself
to football and become a professional.

33:20.760 --> 33:21.600
I think so.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.600
When he trains or plays,
I like to know how he evolves,

33:31.679 --> 33:33.639
because I can't go or see.

33:33.719 --> 33:35.800
Gio goes to see him every now and then,

33:36.879 --> 33:38.439
and I see him when I go home too.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.480
He asks me how I did,
what he did, how he ran,

33:41.560 --> 33:43.159
and I like it when he does well.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.280
<i> What was the score?</i>
- Seven to five for Juve.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.399
<i> They won seven to five?</i>
- Yes.

33:50.919 --> 33:53.679
- <i>Did he score?</i>
- No, he assisted three.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.159
<i> Ah, okay.</i>

33:56.240 --> 33:58.320
- Very good assistance.
- <i> Okay, okay.</i>

33:59.480 --> 34:03.080
<i>- Hey, but you didn't record any.</i>
- Hey!I sent you one of the assists.

34:04.919 --> 34:07.840
But only time will tell.
I'll never pressure him.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.560
He'll do what he wants.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.360
Also, to be honest, what I want the most,

34:12.440 --> 34:14.280
as well as Cristianito and everyone else,

34:14.360 --> 34:16.760
is that they're happy
and they choose what they want.

34:16.839 --> 34:18.440
I'll support in any way.

34:19.839 --> 34:22.839
Come here and speak with your father.
Tell him how it went. Come here.

34:24.239 --> 34:26.600
Talk to your dad
and tell him how you behaved. Come on.

34:26.679 --> 34:27.560
Huh?

34:29.520 --> 34:30.400
Tell him.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.639
- <i>Hi, Mateo.</i>
- How did you behave?

34:34.199 --> 34:36.319
Don't put your fingers in your mouth,
don't be nasty.

34:37.679 --> 34:38.920
How did you behave?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.159
No, to Dad. To Dad.

34:41.239 --> 34:44.080
Hmm. Oh, that's how you behaved, right?

34:44.159 --> 34:45.679
Downwards, downwards.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.880
- Very bad. Very bad.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.120
Alana, come. Eva, come.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.239
I got my clothes and my pants wet.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.839
- No, I don't want--
- Come tell Dad how you all behaved.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.480
Well, they don't even listen to me.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.960
The best thing that we can do
is have children and educate them,

35:08.520 --> 35:10.560
to feel unconditional love.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.680
And that in a way
is something inexplicable,

35:13.760 --> 35:16.200
that only parents can understand
what I'm saying.

35:16.799 --> 35:18.480
And… and to have,

35:18.560 --> 35:22.319
I'll say it again, a woman by your side
who gives you stability--

35:23.880 --> 35:26.319
and the kids' education is phenomenal.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.920
I almost scored, but…

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Very good. You passed the ball.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.680
- Almost all the assists were yours.
- Yes.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.480
Even still today, I ask silly questions.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.319
Cristiano says, "Oh my God,
when are you going to learn?"

35:39.400 --> 35:42.440
And well, I think maybe
once Júnior starts playing…

35:42.520 --> 35:44.040
Let's go. Kids!

35:55.920 --> 35:58.960
When I was little, I used to dream
of having a wonderful family.

36:00.839 --> 36:01.960
Build a home.

36:02.799 --> 36:03.720
One, two, three.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.640
I used to dream of a Prince Charming
by my side,

36:07.720 --> 36:09.440
and today I have one.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.240
With wonderful kids
who give me so much love.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.080
And yes, I can say dreams do come true.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.600
My love. A kiss to Mom.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.000
Ta, ta, ta, ta…

36:29.080 --> 36:30.760
I'll hide downstairs.

36:32.240 --> 36:35.839
MONACO, PRINCIPALITY OF MONACO

36:41.400 --> 36:42.560
How beautiful.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.960
Cris tells me,
"Gio, you have the boat in Monaco."

36:47.040 --> 36:48.319
"You can take your friends."

36:51.760 --> 36:54.120
"Guys, do you want to do something crazy?"

36:54.200 --> 36:56.160
You can't keep an agenda with Georgina.
