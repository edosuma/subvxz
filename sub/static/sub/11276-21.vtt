Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i>

00:04.169 --> 00:06.554
Hey, everybody!

00:06.588 --> 00:09.891
I have a great new way     
      to promote the bar.

00:09.925 --> 00:11.960
( <i>others groaning</i> )       
             REBECCA:           
         No, no, no, no,

00:11.994 --> 00:14.029
you're gonna like this one;   
        it's different.

00:14.063 --> 00:16.731
It not only demonstrates        
social concern,

00:16.765 --> 00:19.066
but it is also         
     contemporary and hip.

00:19.101 --> 00:22.604
Now, Cheers is the bar     
          that cares.

00:22.638 --> 00:25.089
Therefore,              
  if you are not in condition

00:25.124 --> 00:27.459
to drive yourself home,     
        we will appoint

00:27.493 --> 00:30.662
a designated driver,      
        free of charge.

00:30.696 --> 00:32.330
Oh, that's nice,      
          that's really nice.

00:34.283 --> 00:37.919
So is anybody a little tipsy?

00:37.953 --> 00:40.721
Come on,                        
don't be ashamed.

00:40.756 --> 00:42.924
Does anybody feel           
      that they might have

00:42.958 --> 00:46.127
the slightest difficulty    
    driving themselves home?

00:46.161 --> 00:48.597
I might.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.232
Well, hi. I'm Rebecca Howe.

00:50.266 --> 00:53.235
And I would be happy to
         drive you home myself.

00:53.269 --> 00:55.737
That's very nice of you.        
              Where do you live?

00:55.771 --> 00:57.772
Philadelphia.

00:59.408 --> 01:01.042
Well, what's    
                your address?

01:01.076 --> 01:04.979
Eh, it's a blue house;          
I'll know it when I see it.

Frasier?

01:53.145 --> 01:55.713
It's time to take mother    
    to her hair appointment.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.265
Oh, well,                       
then we'd better hurry up

01:57.300 --> 01:59.500
before they run out             
of her special shade of blue.

02:01.170 --> 02:04.305
Frasier, how many times     
  have mother and I asked you

02:04.340 --> 02:06.874
to cease and desist       
    with the snide, cliché,

02:06.908 --> 02:08.241
battle-axe,                     
mother-in-law jokes?

02:08.276 --> 02:09.978
You know mother's               
not like that.

02:10.012 --> 02:11.379
You're right,  
                dear, I'm sorry.

02:11.413 --> 02:13.848
Uh, I was just trying   
        to amuse my friends.

02:13.882 --> 02:15.166
Geez, it wasn't
                     very funny.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.700
CLIFF ( <i>chuckles</i> ):
             Well, you-you know

02:16.735 --> 02:18.986
what was funny,                 
when you said you could hear

02:19.021 --> 02:20.555
her perfume coming a mile away.

02:20.589 --> 02:22.123
NORM:              
  Yeah, yeah, or the one where

02:22.157 --> 02:24.075
you said, uh, she's     
          had so many facelifts,

02:24.109 --> 02:27.278
if she wants to smile,
      she has to cross her legs.

02:28.614 --> 02:32.417
Lilith, you understand,
        it was all in-in good   
                humor, you know.

02:32.451 --> 02:33.818
Of course.

02:33.852 --> 02:36.421
You know I have                 
a sense of humor                
about mother.

02:36.455 --> 02:37.989
Now, say good-bye               
to your friends.

You're grounded for six weeks.

Shoot!

02:45.063 --> 02:47.565
Hey, Sam.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.384
Hey, Woody, what's new?

02:49.418 --> 02:53.221
Well, nothing much.

02:53.255 --> 02:55.056
Oh, your car alarm's            
going off.

02:55.090 --> 02:57.041
What? Someone's     
              breaking in my car

02:57.075 --> 02:59.277
and you don't run in here       
          to tell me?

02:59.311 --> 03:01.279
We're not talking           
    about any car here, man,

03:01.313 --> 03:02.547
we're talking about my 'Vette!

      it's irreplaceable!

Hey, why don't you come
          in and sit down here.

03:09.054 --> 03:10.821
Sam, what about your alarm?

03:10.856 --> 03:13.658
Well, you're taking care of
        that, Woody, aren't you?

03:13.692 --> 03:15.026
I was?

03:15.060 --> 03:18.395
Oh, I must be off           
    in another world.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.433
Sammy's done it again.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.519
How come he always spots        
the gorgeous ones first?

03:25.554 --> 03:30.175
'Cause he doesn't spend
            all his time peeling
    dead skin off his elbows?

03:33.645 --> 03:36.847
What, are you gonna             
do it for me?

03:38.433 --> 03:40.468
So, how can I help you?

03:40.503 --> 03:42.069
I'm looking for Becky Howe.

03:42.104 --> 03:44.205
Wow, well, Becky'll 
            be here in a minute.

03:44.239 --> 03:46.641
In the meantime, can    
          I interest you in a...

03:46.675 --> 03:48.476
Sam Malone?

03:48.510 --> 03:49.744
No, thanks.

03:49.778 --> 03:51.946
But I will have           
      a Perrier with lime.      
                             Ah.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.964
Sworn off the hard stuff, huh?

03:55.300 --> 03:56.700
Coming right up.

03:56.735 --> 03:57.868
Sam.                    
                        Yeah?

03:57.903 --> 03:59.370
It was nothing.                 
                     Oh, thanks.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.373
Hey, listen, you know that girl 
you were talking to?            
                      Yep.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.342
I swear I've seen her           
someplace before.

04:04.376 --> 04:06.977
Well, she asked for Rebecca.    
Called her Becky.

04:07.012 --> 04:08.279
Must be old friends.

04:08.313 --> 04:10.381
Yeah, that could explain a lot.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.883
What's that supposed to mean?

04:11.917 --> 04:13.351
CLIFF:                          
Well, figure it out.

04:13.385 --> 04:14.919
Rebecca, who doesn't date,

04:14.954 --> 04:18.156
suddenly has this               
good-looking <i>friend</i> show up.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.291
A slender, boyish,

04:20.325 --> 04:23.494
female friend,                  
with whom she probably, uh,

04:23.528 --> 04:28.432
sunbathed nude somewhere,       
perhaps on the Isle of Lesbos.

04:29.951 --> 04:33.187
They ever get the tests back
     on that dog that bit you?

04:36.525 --> 04:39.527
So, uh, where do you    
        know Becky from?

04:39.561 --> 04:42.229
She's my sister.        
        I'm Susan Howe.

04:42.264 --> 04:43.698
You're sisters?!

04:43.732 --> 04:45.333
Well, of course!

04:45.367 --> 04:46.567
God, I love sisters!

04:46.602 --> 04:50.505
I love the whole idea      
          of sisters.

04:50.539 --> 04:52.273
Well, any sister    
              of Rebecca is a...

04:52.308 --> 04:53.908
Are there any   
                more of you?

04:53.943 --> 04:55.576
Uh, afraid not.

04:55.610 --> 04:57.511
Well, no, that's...
        You're more than enough.

04:57.546 --> 04:59.613
( <i>laughs</i> ):   
                  Oh, wow!

04:59.648 --> 05:01.399
( <i>whispers</i> ):          
        Sam, come here.

05:01.433 --> 05:02.500
Let me tell     
                  you something.

05:02.534 --> 05:03.701
Excuse me. What?

05:03.735 --> 05:05.536
I just remembered who she is.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.371
That's Susan Howe.

05:07.406 --> 05:08.939
I know, she's   
            Rebecca's sister.

05:08.974 --> 05:12.176
No, the actress-- I saw her     
in <i>Night of the Mutants.</i>

05:13.712 --> 05:17.014
What, is that a movie,      
    or your family reunion?

05:18.183 --> 05:20.050
A movie, Carla.

05:21.553 --> 05:23.821
I don't remember, uh, 
         Rebecca saying anything

05:23.855 --> 05:25.923
about having a sister who   
          was in a horror movie.

05:25.957 --> 05:27.658
Are you sure about that?

05:27.692 --> 05:29.727
Let me check.

05:29.761 --> 05:31.429
Yeah.

05:35.167 --> 05:37.067
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

05:37.102 --> 05:39.237
You know, if she had            
another, smaller head

05:39.271 --> 05:42.240
growing out of her neck,        
I'd be positive.

05:42.274 --> 05:43.807
I got to check this out.

05:43.842 --> 05:48.045
Hey, ask her if 
            they let her keep   
            the little head.

05:50.215 --> 05:54.385
Sorry about that.   
            Uh, bar business.

05:54.419 --> 05:55.903
So, what brings you to Boston?

05:55.937 --> 05:57.705
I'm shooting a bank commercial.

05:57.740 --> 05:58.906
Oh, I was right!

05:58.940 --> 06:01.609
You <i>are</i> Susan Howe,
                    the actress.

06:01.643 --> 06:04.044
I loved you in that
              two-headed movie.

06:04.079 --> 06:05.413
Oh, which one?                  
I did two of them.

06:05.447 --> 06:07.615
Was it the one where the head   
was coming out of my neck?

06:07.649 --> 06:08.983
Uh, yeah, that's the one.

06:09.017 --> 06:11.752
Oh, thank goodness,             
because the other one           
I am not proud of.

06:11.787 --> 06:13.854
Oh.

06:13.889 --> 06:18.759
Well, so, you're, uh,      
 you're here to see Becky, huh?

06:18.794 --> 06:21.662
How long has it been
            since the two of you
                 saw each other?

06:21.697 --> 06:23.398
Ooh, it must be three years.

06:23.432 --> 06:25.400
We had a little... falling out.

06:25.434 --> 06:29.103
I only hope we're grown up      
enough now to kiss and make up.

06:29.137 --> 06:32.206
Grown-up sisters,           
     kissing and making up.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.842
That warms my cockles.     
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )

06:36.545 --> 06:40.247
Let's get you two gals     
    back together, shall we?

06:40.282 --> 06:42.317
Will you excuse me 
             just a minute here?

06:44.286 --> 06:46.921
CLIFF:             
So, uh, what's the bone, Jerome?

06:46.955 --> 06:49.757
Any late-breaking   
                 bulletins here?
Yeah, oh, yeah.

06:49.791 --> 06:51.892
I think I'm on to something   
         here, fellas.

06:51.927 --> 06:54.645
Carla, you hate your
             sister, don't you?

06:54.680 --> 06:57.132
Sure, why?

06:57.166 --> 06:58.566
Well, what would I have to do

06:58.601 --> 07:00.468
to get the two of you      
     back together again?

07:00.503 --> 07:04.656
Simple, Sam, ask me to come down
     and identify her body.

07:06.308 --> 07:07.508
She's missing the point.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.844
Can you imagine what            
the reward might be

07:09.878 --> 07:13.114
for anybody who would act as    
a peacemaker between these two

07:13.148 --> 07:17.185
tragically estranged      
  but perky-bottomed sisters?

07:17.219 --> 07:18.169
Ah...

07:18.203 --> 07:21.539
To Sammy, the man who 
          keeps the dream alive.

07:21.573 --> 07:23.241
CARLA:                          
Wait a minute.

07:23.275 --> 07:25.343
What makes you think you    
    can get the both of them?

07:25.377 --> 07:28.513
It's taken you two years    
    to get a polite kick in     
      the teeth from number one.

07:28.547 --> 07:30.965
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
            Carla, Carla, Carla.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.185
Am I gonna have to teach you    
about women?

07:37.406 --> 07:40.007
Yeah, Cliff, why don't you?

07:41.042 --> 07:43.044
Nah, you better take            
this one, Sammy.

07:43.078 --> 07:45.480
I don't want to hog             
the spotlight.

07:45.514 --> 07:47.515
Carla...

07:47.549 --> 07:50.317
I know you don't have a lot
        of experience with this,

07:50.352 --> 07:53.721
but sometimes women 
            get... really happy.

07:53.755 --> 07:56.023
And when that happens,

07:56.057 --> 07:59.059
they get all emotional
                 and vulnerable.

07:59.094 --> 08:01.529
And that's when it's time   
            for a fella like me,

08:01.563 --> 08:03.464
who's very sensitive    
          and caring, to move in

08:03.499 --> 08:07.201
and give new meaning to the   
words, "triple-decker Sam-ich."

08:07.235 --> 08:08.402
NORM:   
                    Hey, hey!

                    Hey, hey!

08:10.071 --> 08:11.606
Hey!                  
                      All right!

08:11.640 --> 08:14.108
So, Cliff...          
                        Huh?

08:14.142 --> 08:15.877
tell me more about women.

08:18.397 --> 08:20.865
Well, all right here, uh...

08:20.899 --> 08:23.735
They're warm and soft, and...

08:23.769 --> 08:25.002
( <i>sighs</i> )

08:25.036 --> 08:26.971
...when they wash their cars,   
they're dressed

08:27.005 --> 08:30.641
in nothing but suds,            
a suntan and a cowboy hat.

08:33.062 --> 08:36.380
Sorry, I must have drifted away 
there for a second.

08:40.217 --> 08:41.602
( <i>sighs</i> ):
                        So...

08:41.636 --> 08:43.004
Oh, whoa, wait,
                     wait, wait.

08:43.038 --> 08:44.672
I've got a
            surprise for you.

08:44.706 --> 08:47.274
Sam, move your hand; your       
  cologne is stinging my eyes.

08:47.308 --> 08:49.026
Come here, come here, 
         there's someone waiting

08:49.061 --> 08:51.829
to see you, and     
              you're never gonna
            guess who it is.

08:51.863 --> 08:54.031
Careful, careful.   
        You are gonna love this.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.968
Ta-da!

08:58.270 --> 08:59.736
Susan.

09:01.139 --> 09:02.606
What are you doing here?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.575
I wanted to see you.

09:04.609 --> 09:06.677
Well, now   
                 you've seen me.

09:06.711 --> 09:09.480
Yep, yep, there you are.

09:10.648 --> 09:14.285
Boy, oh, boy,          
    is this a moment.

09:14.319 --> 09:16.087
Yeah, I was here on a job,

09:16.121 --> 09:18.856
and I thought I'd drop in       
         and say hello.

09:18.890 --> 09:19.673
Hello.

09:19.708 --> 09:21.058
Good-bye.

09:21.092 --> 09:22.276
Fine, I tried.

09:22.310 --> 09:23.644
You are obviously           
        not interested.

09:23.678 --> 09:25.813
Obviously.
             No, no!            
    Wait, wait, wait a minute.

09:25.848 --> 09:27.248
Come back here.         
        Listen, listen.

09:27.282 --> 09:29.283
You know what's happening here, 
     you're both so excited

09:29.317 --> 09:32.186
to see each other that you're  
  getting all tensed up here.

09:32.221 --> 09:34.355
I think what we need to do      
        is put ourselves

09:34.389 --> 09:36.323
into a little bit           
  of a more relaxed situation.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.992
I know this hot tub club

09:38.026 --> 09:39.493
where we can get                
group rates.

09:39.527 --> 09:41.162
I'm kidding,          
    I'm kidding about that.

09:41.196 --> 09:43.430
What we should do is,      
     we should go upstairs,

09:43.465 --> 09:46.200
and we should have lunch    
         at Melville's.

09:46.235 --> 09:48.836
Just the three of us.      
What do you say? My treat.

09:48.871 --> 09:51.072
Well, I did come here      
          to make up.

09:51.106 --> 09:52.340
Huh?

09:52.374 --> 09:54.158
I did skip breakfast.

09:54.193 --> 09:56.126
All right!              
    That's the spirit!

09:56.161 --> 09:59.263
Family! That's what made        
this country great.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.031
Come on.

10:03.768 --> 10:05.135
Sam...          
    Yes?

10:05.170 --> 10:06.704
why are you so
             desperate to see my
        sister and I make up?

10:06.738 --> 10:08.573
I mean, what    
                is it to you?

10:08.607 --> 10:11.309
Is this another stupid 
        ploy to get me into bed?

10:11.343 --> 10:13.143
Oh, come on, Rebecca,           
don't be ridiculous!

10:13.178 --> 10:15.479
I'm thinking of <i>both</i> of you.

10:27.025 --> 10:29.460
This is nice.

10:29.494 --> 10:30.994
Rebecca, I can't finish     
        my filet.

10:31.029 --> 10:32.063
Do you want the rest?

10:32.097 --> 10:34.365
Why, do you want me to get fat?

10:34.399 --> 10:35.566
Oh, come on,

10:35.600 --> 10:38.502
you have not been fat      
  since you were 12 years old.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.704
Of course, you were       
    the Goodyear blimp then.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.892
At least when I gave      
  my "I am an American" speech

10:44.926 --> 10:47.361
at the Flag Day assembly,       
     I did not wet myself.

10:48.797 --> 10:50.430
Rebecca, I was six.

10:50.465 --> 10:51.666
But she did, Sam, she did.

10:51.700 --> 10:52.833
Shut up.                
         You shut up.

10:52.868 --> 10:54.518
No, you shut up.            
    No, you shut up!

10:54.553 --> 10:56.571
Shut up...!

11:02.378 --> 11:05.045
This is nice.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.215
You know, I really don't think  
this was such a good idea, Sam.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.716
And I hope you'll   
            excuse me, Susan,

11:08.750 --> 11:10.417
if I don't clean    
              your table scraps.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.519
Oh, wait a minute, sit down,  
        will you, pl...?

11:12.554 --> 11:14.521
Girls, girls, girls,      
    what is the big problem

11:14.556 --> 11:16.123
between you two anyway?

11:16.158 --> 11:18.592
Sam, it is one of those     
    complicated issues

11:18.626 --> 11:21.762
that you can't just pin down  
    into one certain thing.

11:21.796 --> 11:23.197
Well, try.

11:23.232 --> 11:24.749
( <i>sighs</i> ):              
        All right.

11:24.783 --> 11:26.250
Dan Buddinger.

11:27.268 --> 11:29.536
Mike Dietz, Jeff Carnahan,

11:29.571 --> 11:32.055
Ron Allen, Steve        
        Melman, Terry Toban,

11:32.090 --> 11:33.924
Clay Fisher...
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.577
Does this have anything to do  
    with boy trouble?

11:36.612 --> 11:40.430
Yes. The trouble is, she can't 
  keep her hands off my boys.

11:40.465 --> 11:43.233
If it bothered you that much why
didn't you just take them back?

11:43.267 --> 11:46.420
Because I didn't want to stoop 
         to your level!

11:46.455 --> 11:50.808
Besides, I tried
             and it didn't work.

11:50.842 --> 11:53.777
Look, the point is,       
that was back when we were kids.

11:53.812 --> 11:55.145
A million things have changed.

11:55.179 --> 11:56.947
No, no, no,           
     the fact still remains

11:56.982 --> 11:59.216
that every time         
    I am attracted to a guy,

11:59.250 --> 12:01.284
you are on him         
      like white on rice.

12:01.319 --> 12:03.687
So excuse me if I   
        don't leap over there

12:03.722 --> 12:05.773
and say forgive me,
         please, please, please,

12:05.808 --> 12:07.141
for breaking    
                my heart over

12:07.175 --> 12:08.375
and over and over and over.

12:08.410 --> 12:10.478
Excuse me,              
I have to get out of here.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.980
I have work to do.

12:13.932 --> 12:17.067
Sam, I'm sorry                  
you had to see that.

12:17.101 --> 12:19.153
Well, that's okay.

12:19.187 --> 12:22.507
I don't think it was
         fair for Rebecca to say

12:22.541 --> 12:26.511
that you tried to   
             steal every guy she
         ever got interested in.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.779
But I'm warning you
              right now, missy,

12:28.814 --> 12:31.498
you better not
            try that with me.

12:33.034 --> 12:35.336
Oh, Rebecca's interested in you?

12:35.370 --> 12:37.204
Are you kidding me?

12:37.238 --> 12:39.273
She's got a big old
                    crush on me.

12:39.308 --> 12:43.344
Well, I am glad to see     
she hasn't lost her good taste.

12:43.378 --> 12:46.814
Well, that's very sweet
             of you to say that.

12:46.848 --> 12:48.783
More wine?

12:50.652 --> 12:53.287
This is nice.   
              This is very nice.

13:02.648 --> 13:05.082
I snuck out of the house.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.317
So don't tell Lilith.

13:07.352 --> 13:08.519
Gee, where's Sam?

13:08.553 --> 13:09.987
Oh, he'll be            
        here any minute.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.756
He's still up having lunch with 
Miss Howe's sister, Miss Howe.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.575
Oh, you mean Rebecca's sister's 
            in town.

13:15.610 --> 13:18.228
Susan Howe,                     
the, uh, movie star.

13:18.263 --> 13:20.248
You mean, <i>the</i> Susan Howe,

13:20.282 --> 13:22.083
the star of           
      <i>Night of the Mutants?</i>

13:23.818 --> 13:25.269
Wow.                       
                    You saw it?

13:25.303 --> 13:27.905
Well, yes. Lilith and I         
rented it last week.

13:27.939 --> 13:28.706
Oh, really?

13:28.740 --> 13:31.125
You two don't seem
         the slasher-movie type.

13:31.159 --> 13:33.310
Oh, well, purely for scientific 
      purposes of course.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.778
But, you know,         
    this may surprise you--

13:34.812 --> 13:36.313
I rather enjoyed it.

13:36.348 --> 13:37.348
See, I think films with scenes

13:37.382 --> 13:40.017
of graphic disembowelment       
         and mutilation

13:40.051 --> 13:42.052
can, in some cases,       
        help people to,

13:42.086 --> 13:44.421
well, release some of the fears 
        and aggressions

13:44.456 --> 13:46.390
of modern society.

13:46.424 --> 13:47.891
Also, it's the first time       
        Lilith's mother

13:47.925 --> 13:50.727
went home before 9:00...    
        screaming.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.166
Hey, everybody.

13:55.200 --> 13:59.470
Oh, Miss Howe, I'm
              Dr. Frasier Crane.

13:59.504 --> 14:00.904
My wife and I  
                rented your film

14:00.938 --> 14:02.839
<i>Night of the Mutants</i>   
            <i>last week, and, uh,</i>

14:02.874 --> 14:04.709
well, I was wondering, um...

14:04.743 --> 14:05.943
could I have your autograph?

14:05.977 --> 14:07.077
Ah...         
    Sure.

14:07.111 --> 14:07.995
Thank you.

14:08.029 --> 14:09.346
Uh, I tell you what,

14:09.380 --> 14:10.881
just make it out to

14:10.916 --> 14:13.484
"Mother Sternin."

14:15.420 --> 14:20.358
And say, if you would,
          "I know where you live

14:20.392 --> 14:21.893
and I'm going to get you."

14:24.963 --> 14:28.132
Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,       
    what's the skinny, huh?

14:28.166 --> 14:30.134
Yeah, what's the score?
                     Two to one?

14:30.168 --> 14:33.487
Guys, guys,                     
I know I've accomplished

14:33.521 --> 14:36.824
some truly legendary            
feats in my day,

14:36.858 --> 14:39.927
but this...                     
this is my masterpiece.

14:39.961 --> 14:42.562
This is my Moaning Lisa.

14:42.597 --> 14:43.563
( <i>chuckling</i> )

14:43.598 --> 14:45.633
Okay, tell me: 
                 what's the plan

14:45.667 --> 14:47.167
and how are we involved?

14:47.201 --> 14:49.369
Well, here it is                
and you're not.

14:51.372 --> 14:54.775
Turns out that these two sisters
     are very competitive--

14:54.809 --> 14:56.677
especially when it come to guys.

14:56.711 --> 14:58.712
So all I had to do was      
    let the little one know

14:58.747 --> 15:00.580
that the big one        
      had the hots for me

15:00.615 --> 15:04.284
and bingo, she was eating       
        out of my hand.

15:04.318 --> 15:05.886
Was she wearing                 
a cowboy hat?

15:08.189 --> 15:09.857
It's a figure of speech,    
            Cliffie.

15:09.891 --> 15:11.525
Well, she could have been.

15:12.894 --> 15:14.628
What I need to do now      
          is make sure

15:14.663 --> 15:16.930
that the big one knows that   
  the little one is interested

15:16.965 --> 15:19.499
and I will be ping-ponging      
    between the two of them

15:19.534 --> 15:22.169
until they bury me          
    with a smile on my face.

15:22.203 --> 15:23.370
( <i>chuckling</i> )

15:23.404 --> 15:27.474
No, please stop.        
     I'm too young to die.

15:27.508 --> 15:30.544
( <i>screams</i> )

15:30.578 --> 15:32.012
Breathtaking!

15:34.732 --> 15:36.700
Thanks. You guys        
     are a great audience.

15:36.734 --> 15:38.402
What'd I miss?

15:38.436 --> 15:40.187
Have you had her scream for you,
              Sam?

15:40.221 --> 15:41.889
Later, Woody. Later.

15:44.225 --> 15:46.660
Okay, uh, let's 
                see, the plan is

15:46.695 --> 15:49.296
that I meet you back here   
        at closing time, right?

15:49.330 --> 15:50.463
Yeah, can't wait.

15:50.498 --> 15:51.799
Yeah.           
      See you then.

15:51.833 --> 15:53.000
Oh, boy.

15:53.034 --> 15:54.485
Yeah, it's not fair.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.487
All the chicks                  
in that family

15:56.521 --> 15:58.355
are loaded                      
with great faces,

15:58.389 --> 15:59.790
hair, bods.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.659
What'd my family get?

16:01.693 --> 16:04.161
Look at the bright
                    side, Carla.

16:04.195 --> 16:07.397
Probably takes them hours 
     to get ready every morning,

16:07.432 --> 16:09.333
whereas you look
                the same with or
                without makeup,

16:09.367 --> 16:11.869
and your hair   
    practically combs itself.

16:15.907 --> 16:18.074
Thanks, Woody.

16:18.109 --> 16:21.044
Never hurts to spread      
    a little sunshine.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.348
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

16:26.051 --> 16:27.751
Hi.                         
                      Hi.

16:27.785 --> 16:29.219
So, what is it?

16:29.253 --> 16:31.321
Well, um, I don't...

16:31.355 --> 16:33.023
I don't want          
      to get in the middle

16:33.058 --> 16:34.858
of a family squabble, but...

16:34.893 --> 16:37.160
your sister                     
just asked me out.

16:37.195 --> 16:39.563
She what?!

16:39.597 --> 16:41.965
Yeah, is that the craziest      
        thing, or what?

16:41.999 --> 16:44.601
She obviously thinks      
that I'm attracted to you.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.570
Oh, come on,          
why would she think that?

16:46.604 --> 16:48.689
I don't know;          
     did you say something?

16:48.723 --> 16:49.906
Me? Come o...

16:49.940 --> 16:53.877
What would I have to gain       
 by saying something like that?

16:53.911 --> 16:55.446
Man, this makes
                 me so furious!

16:55.480 --> 16:57.348
She comes out here          
 and she says that she's sorry

16:57.382 --> 16:58.482
and she wants to make up for it,

16:58.516 --> 17:00.183
and then the second       
      my back is turned,

17:00.218 --> 17:02.753
she comes onto the guy     
  she thinks is my boyfriend.

17:02.787 --> 17:04.655
If there's just something       
          you could do

17:04.689 --> 17:05.989
to get back at her.

17:07.141 --> 17:08.842
What could we do,           
    what could we do,

17:08.876 --> 17:11.412
what could we do?

17:14.198 --> 17:16.233
Did you say that you'd     
        go out with her?

17:16.267 --> 17:18.469
Yeah, but I could kick myself  
        for that.

17:18.502 --> 17:19.603
That was perfect.

17:19.637 --> 17:20.938
Sit down here a second.

17:20.972 --> 17:23.273
You know how you've always
      wanted to go out with me?

17:23.308 --> 17:24.308
Yeah.

17:24.342 --> 17:26.310
Well, now your wish is
        going to come true.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.045
You break that date
                 with my sister,

17:28.079 --> 17:29.980
and I will go   
                out with you.

17:30.014 --> 17:31.782
Oh. Oh, boy.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.417
That is vicious,

17:33.452 --> 17:34.268
but she asked for it.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.386
And, Sam?   
        Yeah?

17:35.420 --> 17:37.354
Thank you.    
Oh, you kidding me?

17:37.389 --> 17:38.689
Come on,                        
what are friends for?

17:45.630 --> 17:47.565
( <i>register rings</i> )

17:47.599 --> 17:48.632
Well, fellas...

17:48.667 --> 17:49.967
at this very moment,

17:50.001 --> 17:51.702
Rebecca Howe is in her house

17:51.736 --> 17:53.671
spending two hours          
     getting into an outfit

17:53.705 --> 17:56.173
she's going to spend two minutes
        getting out of.

17:56.207 --> 17:58.375
Hey, what are you going to
      do about that sister, huh?

17:58.409 --> 18:00.844
Oh, I already made a phone call 
     to postpone our date.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.245
Oh, you going to take her out   
tomorrow night?

18:02.280 --> 18:04.381
No, I'm going to take her out  
     in a couple of hours.

18:05.450 --> 18:06.784
No, don't worry.

18:06.818 --> 18:08.017
We'll be back here          
         in the morning

18:08.052 --> 18:09.219
for our usual debriefing.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.021
By that time, I'll be able      
 to compare and contrast them.

18:12.056 --> 18:13.957
And that's when this stuff      
    gets really interesting.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.626
Yeah.

18:15.660 --> 18:16.727
Sammy?                          
                        Yeah?

18:16.761 --> 18:19.730
Sorry I was a little hard       
on you before, but you know,

18:19.764 --> 18:21.481
I was just trying           
    to make you reach.

18:21.516 --> 18:23.517
Push out the edges          
        of the envelope.

18:23.551 --> 18:25.385
CLIFF:                          
We're all proud                 
of you, Sammy.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.921
God bless you on this night,    
Sam Malone.

18:38.749 --> 18:41.084
Oh. At la...

18:41.119 --> 18:42.786
Susan.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.553
Oh, Sam,

18:43.587 --> 18:45.355
I know                          
you put off our date,

18:45.390 --> 18:46.390
but I just couldn't wait

18:46.424 --> 18:50.059
to see you.
            You're all I've been

18:50.094 --> 18:51.861
thinking about today.

18:51.896 --> 18:53.797
Is there someplace private      
        we can go

18:53.831 --> 18:56.099
for a few minutes where I can...

18:56.133 --> 18:58.769
touch you and hold you?

18:58.803 --> 19:01.605
Um, usually I go        
  for this stuff in a big way,

19:01.639 --> 19:03.340
but at the moment...

19:03.374 --> 19:05.442
I'm in a little bit       
      of a time jam here.

19:05.476 --> 19:08.144
Oh, I'm <i>so</i> in the mood.

19:08.179 --> 19:13.417
And I am so good
          when I am in the mood.

19:13.451 --> 19:15.251
Would you excuse me             
for a second?

19:15.286 --> 19:17.487
I got to make a 
            quick phone call.

19:17.522 --> 19:19.289
I'll be right back.

19:24.629 --> 19:26.913
Oh, come on, Rebecca, pick up, 
pick up, pick up, please.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.900
Pick up, pick   
                up, pick up.

19:34.072 --> 19:36.806
As long as you're not going     
to be talking with those lips...

19:36.841 --> 19:38.942
( <i>groaning</i> )
( <i>provocative chuckle</i> )

19:38.977 --> 19:41.144
( <i>both moaning and chuckling</i> )

19:41.179 --> 19:42.412
Oh...

19:42.446 --> 19:44.181
( <i>both continue moaning</i> )

19:45.850 --> 19:47.817
Sam, I'm ready                  
for our date.

19:47.852 --> 19:49.253
Susan!

19:49.287 --> 19:51.121
Uh, Rebecca, I
            can explain this.

19:51.155 --> 19:52.489
Wait, just... Ow.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.024
My finger's caught              
in your bra.

19:55.677 --> 19:57.210
Listen...

19:57.245 --> 19:59.312
You don't owe me                
an explanation.

19:59.347 --> 20:00.848
It's Susan.

20:00.882 --> 20:02.733
It's always been Susan.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.135
My entire life,         
    it has been Susan.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.203
I'm glad you saw us.

20:06.237 --> 20:07.838
You deserve to be hurt.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.523
Oh, no, sister.                 
                 Come on.

20:09.557 --> 20:12.726
I don't hurt anymore;   
        I am way beyond hurt.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.661
Don't be silly, now, girls,   
        please, please.

20:14.696 --> 20:18.482
And now it is Susan Howe's turn 
            to hurt.

20:18.516 --> 20:21.601
( <i>gasping</i> )                     
         Hey, that's a gun.

20:21.636 --> 20:23.454
It ain't licorice.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.304
No, come on, let...

20:24.422 --> 20:25.522
Let's talk about this.

20:25.556 --> 20:26.790
Now, this is silly.

20:26.824 --> 20:28.658
No, please,           
     I'm too young to die.

20:28.692 --> 20:30.109
Rebecca.                        
      ( <i>Susan screaming</i> )

20:30.144 --> 20:32.145
( <i>gunshot</i> )
              Oh...!

20:32.180 --> 20:33.897
Holy cow!

20:35.833 --> 20:37.918
That was for Dan Buddinger.

20:37.952 --> 20:39.720
And this is for Jeff Carnahan.

20:39.754 --> 20:40.904
( gunshot )           
                      Oh...!

20:40.939 --> 20:42.839
And Mike Dietz.

20:42.874 --> 20:43.790
( gunshot )

20:43.825 --> 20:46.009
And Sam Malone.

20:46.044 --> 20:48.845
( <i>three gunshots</i> )

20:48.879 --> 20:51.614
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

20:53.184 --> 20:54.484
What did...?

20:54.518 --> 20:55.718
What is it, Sam?

20:55.753 --> 20:57.871
Oh!

20:59.074 --> 21:00.890
What, because I killed     
        my sister?

21:00.925 --> 21:02.409
Uh-huh!

21:02.443 --> 21:05.011
I didn't mean to do that anyway.

21:05.045 --> 21:06.613
Oh, well, it's done.

21:06.647 --> 21:09.532
All right...
              we got to get this
            body out of here.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.201
Wha...? Wha...?

21:11.235 --> 21:12.902
You got to help me, Sam;    
            come on.

21:12.937 --> 21:14.371
Come on, take a hold of her.

21:14.405 --> 21:15.672
Come on.                        
            Oh...!

21:15.706 --> 21:18.808
Everybody does at least one     
bad thing in their life.

21:20.544 --> 21:21.695
Sam, take her hands.

21:21.730 --> 21:22.763
There.

21:22.797 --> 21:24.898
All right, now, make
            sure nobody sees us.

21:24.932 --> 21:26.199
( whimpering )

21:26.368 --> 21:27.050
Stop being a baby!

21:27.084 --> 21:28.568
Oh!

21:28.603 --> 21:30.871
Oh, boy, oh, boy...

21:30.905 --> 21:32.305
Move.

21:35.309 --> 21:36.743
ALL:              
             Sammy!

21:37.979 --> 21:41.481
She did it.

21:41.515 --> 21:43.249
Boy, Sammy, when you said

21:43.284 --> 21:45.786
you were going to knock 'em off 
         one at a time,

21:45.820 --> 21:47.253
you were serious.

21:47.288 --> 21:48.989
Oh, no, no,           
no, you don't understand.

21:49.023 --> 21:50.824
I mean, she... she's real...

21:50.858 --> 21:53.076
I'm dead.

21:59.650 --> 22:01.952
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

22:06.891 --> 22:07.691
That wasn't funny.

22:07.725 --> 22:09.826
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

22:09.861 --> 22:12.111
That wasn't funny.

22:12.146 --> 22:14.414
I mean, that's the kind of thing
     that could, you know,

22:14.449 --> 22:17.116
give somebody          
     serious mental damage.

22:17.151 --> 22:18.251
Am I right, Lilith?

22:18.285 --> 22:19.769
No, it was funny, Sam.

22:19.804 --> 22:21.705
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

22:24.175 --> 22:26.910
Susan, Susan, you   
                were so good.

22:26.944 --> 22:28.511
Wasn't Susan good?

22:30.915 --> 22:32.448
SUSAN:                          
You were pretty good            
yourself.

22:36.754 --> 22:38.422
Sam, are you all right?

22:38.456 --> 22:40.690
I'm hurt.

22:42.393 --> 22:44.611
I'm hurt and I'm...

22:44.645 --> 22:46.346
I'm offended.

22:46.380 --> 22:47.681
And quite frankly,          
        I can't believe

22:47.715 --> 22:50.851
that you two think that     
this is some sort of silly joke.

22:50.885 --> 22:51.785
Am I right, Norm?

22:51.819 --> 22:53.953
( <i>laughing</i> ):   
                        Yeah.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.712
I'm never going to
            speak to either     
              one of you again.

23:01.746 --> 23:05.682
Oh, Sam, that's really too bad, 
  because you know, in a way,

23:05.717 --> 23:07.451
fending off your stupid advances

23:07.485 --> 23:09.386
brought Susan and I       
         back together.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.755
We haven't been 
                this close since
                 we were kids.

23:11.789 --> 23:13.022
We're grateful.
