three attacks rules out multiple hackers.

For about 10 more seconds.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.598
I need him to do one more job...

30:50.724 --> 30:52.021
...before you kill him.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.987
Good news, amigo,
you just got a stay of execution.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.408
We got him.
We found Danielle's car up the block.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.411
There's a bunch of parking tickets.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.368
All from a warehouse around
the marine terminal.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.208
I had Hawkins pull traffic-camera footage
from the corner.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.460
All right, let's move.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.500
Call HRT, have them meet us there.

31:18.126 --> 31:21.847
Look at this. Two weeks ago,
someone cloned Peter's system.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.757
Put it on an external drive.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.928
That person is walking around with his
operating system on a thumb drive.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.141
Exactly.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.728
Plug it into any machine,
it's gonna act like Peter's computer.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.018
The breach could've come
from anyone in here.

31:34.184 --> 31:38.485
- Narrowing it down is not gonna be easy.
- But not impossible.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.568
- What?
- Uh, the server just went offline.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.702
It happens. Be right back.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.565
God, ha, ha. Sam.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.105
You scared me.

32:16.685 --> 32:19.564
What are you doing here?
I thought they cleared everybody out.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.527
It's so sad really.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.911
You were the brightest person in this
place. You could have changed the world.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.327
Instead, you die alone.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.836
Knowing that I'm the one...

32:36.121 --> 32:38.044
That I'm the one who took your future.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.732
Got two teams moving in
around the building.

33:03.899 --> 33:06.197
Set up check points
on the main and service roads.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.862
Access points to the warehouse
are here, here and here.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.873
The two guys inside are the only link
to our mystery man.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.034
We have to take at least one of them alive.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.045
We don't shoot to wound.
Somebody throws down, we end them.

33:17.204 --> 33:20.834
Any other way puts my guys in danger,
and I don't do that kind of thing.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.711
- Got something you wanna say?
- I just said it.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.550
All right, knock it off.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.598
Listen, you do what you have
to do in there. All right?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.263
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.440
Kent?

34:27.023 --> 34:30.652
This is Agent Max Hardy, FBI.
I've got a body.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.821
The suspect is still
active in the building.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.456
I'm at Manitech Securities,
682 Corporate Park Drive.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.208
Backup requested immediately.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.268
- Hands in the air.
- FBI.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.066
Secure the building and search it.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.772
Suspect is still here somewhere.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.319
- How much longer?
- A few minutes.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.746
- Hurry it up.
- Why?

36:38.905 --> 36:40.828
So you can kill me sooner?

36:52.585 --> 36:54.258
Go, go, go.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.307
Yeah, I'll go, I'll go.

[GROANING]

37:57.150 --> 37:58.402
You Okay?

38:00.445 --> 38:01.492
Yeah.

38:06.367 --> 38:09.120
You should go to the hospital.
Your ribs could be fractured.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.881
- You need to get your pacemaker checked.
- I'm fine.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.964
You're lucky. Three inches higher,
you don't have a face.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.424
You might wanna work
on your bedside manner.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.681
WESTON:
Hey. Looks like Duncan...

38:19.839 --> 38:23.013
...was forcing Luis to make
one last passport before he killed him.

38:23.593 --> 38:26.221
- Is this our guy?
- I'm thinking it has to be.

38:27.931 --> 38:28.978
Hey.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.735
Is this the guy that hired you?

38:32.101 --> 38:34.775
I don't know, he found me online.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.316
Tripled my fee,
sent everything through e-mail.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.200
Got copies of the e-mails? Payments?

38:39.359 --> 38:41.327
Yeah, they're right there.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.240
Get him out of here.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.124
Ryan.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.963
He was here, but he got away.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.423
- Thought you arrested the hacker?
- Apparently not.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.839
- He killed an intern.
- What? Are you okay?

39:01.005 --> 39:02.348
Yeah.

39:03.132 --> 39:04.634
Listen, I just sent you a photo.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.769
- Is this the guy you arrested?
- Hold on.

39:12.642 --> 39:15.065
No, it's Tucker.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.442
He runs this place.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.289
Jesus.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.048
Hey, boss.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.967
Nice digs.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.173
Sam.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.962
How did you get in here?

39:42.171 --> 39:43.548
Really?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.843
That's the question you wanna lead with?

39:46.009 --> 39:49.730
A man is sitting in your living room
in the middle of the night holding a gun.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.018
And you wanna know my method
of ingress?

39:54.183 --> 39:56.561
Don't hurt me.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.990
I'm sorry.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.490
That's kind of the whole plan.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.451
Tucker's in the wind.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.117
The agents arrived on scene,
Tucker's car was missing.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.499
Garage registered his remote exiting
just over an hour ago.

40:13.703 --> 40:16.377
- We put out a statewide alert.
- I went through his laptop.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.385
In addition to passport templates, I found
e-mails to and from an IP address...

40:20.543 --> 40:23.547
...that traces back
to a public library in Akron, Ohio.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.175
- Two miles from Daisy and Kyle's.
- I'm not buying it.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.895
- Excuse me?
- It's too neat, too easy.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.522
The guy is a computer genius.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.025
He leaves his laptop for us to find
with easily unencrypted information?

40:36.184 --> 40:38.278
We have hard evidence,
physical and digital...

40:38.436 --> 40:42.236
...incriminating Tucker without question.
Your job is to find him quickly.

40:42.398 --> 40:45.493
Listen to me,
this guy is a brilliant hacker.

40:45.652 --> 40:49.702
He is a practiced killer,
there's no way he goes down this easy.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.538
My gut is telling me that Tucker Moore
has been framed.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.794
The FBI operates on
evidence, not intuition.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.339
So get on board with finding Tucker...

40:58.498 --> 41:00.967
...or I'll put someone in charge who will.

41:24.399 --> 41:25.742
Hey, Papa Bear.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.491
Wanna join us?

hunting for a dead man.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.100
Does anybody believe me?

41:59.726 --> 42:02.229
- No.
- How can they not believe you...

42:02.437 --> 42:04.314
...after all you've done for them?

42:04.480 --> 42:06.824
- It's just downright insulting.
- Damn straight.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.365
They clearly...

42:09.527 --> 42:14.624
...don't appreciate your talents
and capabilities the way I do.

42:16.325 --> 42:19.499
I believe in you, Ryan.

42:22.498 --> 42:24.751
- Do you?
- Of course.

42:25.460 --> 42:26.882
I will always be there for you.

...has abandoned you...

...where will I be?

42:41.309 --> 42:42.561
