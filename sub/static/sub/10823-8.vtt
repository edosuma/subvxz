00:00.788 --> 00:02.411
<i>Previously on Ravenswood:</i>

00:02.433 --> 00:04.734
<i>They found a knife in our backyard.</i>

00:04.786 --> 00:05.735
<i>Somebody put it there.</i>

00:05.787 --> 00:06.787
The knife used to kill your father

00:06.821 --> 00:07.888
had a three-sided blade.

00:07.922 --> 00:09.689
They think she killed my dad.

00:09.724 --> 00:11.024
<i>CALEB: Remy saw the town sign the pact.</i>

00:11.042 --> 00:12.993
<i>MIRANDA: In her dream?</i>

00:13.027 --> 00:15.562
<i>Doing the right thing, son.</i>

00:15.596 --> 00:16.930
Esther wasn't the only
Collins there that night.

00:16.964 --> 00:19.733
There was somebody else from
the family business there.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.868
And that is who Gabriel gave
the pact and the knife to.

00:21.903 --> 00:24.738
It's not the first time with
the sleepwalking, the dreams.

00:24.772 --> 00:25.972
It happened when I was little.

00:26.908 --> 00:28.708
Dad, are you okay.

00:28.726 --> 00:31.611
Liv, can we try to start
over? I really miss you.

00:31.646 --> 00:33.613
<i>So how are things with Dillon?</i>

00:33.648 --> 00:34.815
<i>Really? You did it?</i>

00:34.849 --> 00:36.049
Good night, Springer.

00:36.067 --> 00:37.901
How come Dillon wasn't there this morning?

00:37.935 --> 00:39.736
Where was your boyfriend in all this?

00:39.770 --> 00:41.988
(horn honking)

00:42.023 --> 00:44.591
Springer!

00:44.625 --> 00:45.725
There still are the jars.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.827
You're being pulled back here,

00:46.861 --> 00:48.061
he must have put yours back together.

00:48.095 --> 00:50.964
<i>WOMAN: I know you must
feel like a prisoner.</i>

00:52.700 --> 00:53.834
Stop it now!

00:53.868 --> 00:55.836
Grunwald has a watchdog.

00:55.870 --> 00:57.070
Beatrice Stevens.

00:57.104 --> 00:59.072
Mrs. Grunwald was your daughter.

00:59.106 --> 01:02.609
She probably wants this pact
broken just as much as we do.

01:02.643 --> 01:05.010
Go away and leave us alone.

01:12.787 --> 01:13.820
(door opens)

01:18.626 --> 01:19.926
Is that what I think it is?

01:19.961 --> 01:23.563
A present from Beatrice,
the world's warmest ghost.

01:23.598 --> 01:24.731
She just gave it to you?

01:24.765 --> 01:25.899
Yeah, well, don't worry,

01:25.933 --> 01:28.034
it's not like we're spirit besties.

01:28.069 --> 01:30.570
I think she just gave
it to me so I'd leave.

01:33.658 --> 01:34.741
Are you going to open it?

01:34.775 --> 01:36.776
Of course I'm going to open it.

01:36.811 --> 01:38.812
The last time you were
out, you were tricked

01:38.846 --> 01:41.047
by demons into a haunted house so...

01:41.082 --> 01:43.683
Yeah.

01:43.751 --> 01:45.952
I'm smarter now, and
I've got a strict policy

01:45.987 --> 01:47.687
against walking through glowing doorways.

01:47.722 --> 01:51.791
So I know what to expect.

01:51.826 --> 01:53.860
Nobody knows what to expect.

01:53.895 --> 01:54.961
Not in this town.

01:54.996 --> 01:57.597
I want to be out there with you guys.

01:57.632 --> 01:58.932
I hear stories about barns
and underground vaults

01:58.966 --> 02:01.601
and homicidal scarecrows
and it kills me inside.

02:04.705 --> 02:09.743
My whole life, I have never
been a part of anything.

02:09.776 --> 02:13.580
Now I finally am, and I'm
stuck here because of this jar.

02:13.614 --> 02:15.582
Then what are you waiting for?

02:18.953 --> 02:21.755
I'm not afraid of what's out there,

02:21.789 --> 02:25.592
I'm afraid of what's in here.

02:25.626 --> 02:27.627
Collins has already locked me up twice.

02:27.662 --> 02:30.597
What's to keep him from doing that again?

02:33.067 --> 02:34.734
This will only take a minute.

02:34.769 --> 02:36.036
Do you mind?

02:36.070 --> 02:38.838
Oh, be careful with that,
that's not a snow globe.

02:42.043 --> 02:43.977
I still can't believe
I stabbed my own father.

02:44.011 --> 02:46.646
You didn't stab your own father.

02:46.681 --> 02:47.781
It was an accident.

02:47.848 --> 02:49.616
But what if something made me do it?

02:49.650 --> 02:53.687
What if when I fall asleep,
suddenly I'm Evil's puppet?

02:53.721 --> 02:54.687
You're still you.

02:59.794 --> 03:01.928
Okay, I know you're scared.

03:01.963 --> 03:03.997
But this place isn't punishment.

03:04.031 --> 03:08.969
There's a serious group of
MD's and PhD's and, you know,

03:09.003 --> 03:13.873
brainy types here to help you sleep again.

03:13.908 --> 03:16.576
I wish my mom wasn't stuck in Chicago.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.611
She'll be here soon.

03:18.646 --> 03:19.746
And you're here.

03:19.780 --> 03:21.898
Always. Like a bad habit.

03:24.618 --> 03:27.921
Okay, "Please list any external factors"

03:27.955 --> 03:31.758
which may be contributing to
ongoing sleep disturbances."

03:31.792 --> 03:33.693
Is there a box saying century-old pact

03:33.728 --> 03:35.729
that is cursing yo and
your friends to death?

03:35.763 --> 03:37.797
I'll just check "other."

03:40.034 --> 03:44.704
- Thanks for being here.
- It's my job.

03:44.739 --> 03:46.739
Sign it.

03:48.009 --> 03:52.746
Hey, Dillon, it's me again,
this is just a question, okay?

03:52.780 --> 03:54.948
Did you get my messages about Springer?

03:54.982 --> 03:56.016
Call me.

03:58.019 --> 03:59.619
I miss you.

04:04.558 --> 04:06.643
- No answer?
- No.

04:08.946 --> 04:10.864
Springer was talking crazy last night.

04:10.898 --> 04:12.932
He was saying all this stuff
about Dillon and my mom,

04:12.967 --> 04:14.701
and why he did it.

04:14.735 --> 04:16.636
Did what?

04:16.670 --> 04:17.771
I don't know.

04:17.805 --> 04:19.839
I saw you run out into the street,

04:19.874 --> 04:21.007
and then I saw him.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.776
He was looking right at me when...

04:24.812 --> 04:26.212
I can't believe I went out with him.

04:28.949 --> 04:30.617
How's your mom?

04:32.019 --> 04:33.853
Her lawyer's on speed dial

04:33.888 --> 04:34.888
and she's trying to find a guardian-type

04:34.922 --> 04:36.689
who can stay with us

04:36.724 --> 04:38.858
in case she has to be
gone for a little while.

04:38.893 --> 04:40.627
And Mr. Collins found the lawyer?

04:40.661 --> 04:44.731
Yeah, that's a whole other story.

04:44.765 --> 04:45.932
I'll be right back.

04:48.819 --> 04:49.903
Hi, Clark.

04:49.937 --> 04:53.673
Olivia. Have you heard anything?

04:55.676 --> 04:58.027
I'm not supposed to talk
about an ongoing investigation.

04:58.079 --> 04:59.712
Clark, please.

05:01.816 --> 05:04.651
The summary of the
tests on the knife is in,

05:04.685 --> 05:06.519
they're still waiting on a full report.

05:06.554 --> 05:07.921
What else?

05:07.955 --> 05:11.925
Your mom's alibi, it doesn't check out.

05:11.959 --> 05:13.827
What does that mean?

05:13.861 --> 05:15.995
I'm telling you what I hear.

05:16.013 --> 05:18.598
Thanks.

05:23.637 --> 05:25.555
Where are you going?

05:25.606 --> 05:26.839
I have to talk to Springer.

05:26.857 --> 05:29.709
Wait. Wait!

05:31.000 --> 05:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:43.624 --> 05:44.858
Where did you get that?

05:44.892 --> 05:46.793
Do you recognize it?

05:46.827 --> 05:49.596
I've never seen it before.

05:49.630 --> 05:52.999
Well, here, let me show you what's inside.

05:57.004 --> 05:59.906
He knows exactly what's in there.

06:01.976 --> 06:04.511
I'm gonna say this one time,

06:04.578 --> 06:07.847
if anything happens to anyone that I love,

06:07.882 --> 06:09.849
if you touch one hair on their heads...

06:09.884 --> 06:12.685
I don't respond to idle threats.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.555
I've seen more than you
could possibly imagine

06:15.589 --> 06:16.856
and I don't blink easily.

06:20.761 --> 06:22.562
(glass smashes)

06:31.572 --> 06:32.872
You blinked.

06:38.832 --> 06:43.843

<font color="#40bfff">www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:49.957 --> 06:51.808
Well, you definitely got him worried.

06:51.859 --> 06:54.761
Well, I was trying to get him wet.

06:54.795 --> 06:56.796
Do you smell smoke?

06:56.830 --> 06:58.731
I don't smell anything, remember?

07:02.870 --> 07:03.836
Miranda.

07:08.809 --> 07:10.777
World's warmest ghost?

07:10.811 --> 07:13.830
Well, could be a message from Beatrice.

07:13.881 --> 07:16.281
Maybe she overheard the whole
thing and wants to help us now.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.921
SIMON: Dr. Russell, what's going on?

07:21.955 --> 07:23.923
My daughter is sleepwalking, sleep drawing,

07:23.957 --> 07:26.859
and writing in languages I'm
pretty sure she doesn't know.

07:26.894 --> 07:28.761
Dad.

07:28.796 --> 07:32.699
Remy is displaying an unusual
combination of sleep symptoms,

07:32.733 --> 07:35.001
but I'm more concerned
about what the stress

07:35.035 --> 07:36.970
is doing to her physically.

07:37.004 --> 07:38.671
I know that Remy hasn't slept

07:38.706 --> 07:39.939
more than a few hours in the past week.

07:39.974 --> 07:41.808
Mom wasn't supposed to tell you that.

07:41.842 --> 07:44.744
- I'm glad she did.
- I've had a lot on my mind.

07:44.778 --> 07:47.847
Your mind's a busy
place. It always has been.

07:47.881 --> 07:51.784
You saw a psychologist
for sleep-related issues

07:51.819 --> 07:52.986
when you were 7?

07:53.020 --> 07:54.988
Yeah.

07:55.022 --> 07:56.823
He was an old guy.

07:56.857 --> 07:59.626
He had these amazing
tiki masks on his wall.

07:59.660 --> 08:02.495
Dr. Elmore. He sent me your file.

08:02.529 --> 08:04.764
You were sleepwalking,
suffering night terrors.

08:04.798 --> 08:06.733
You'd wake up screaming night after night.

08:06.767 --> 08:08.835
I've reviewed your history,

08:08.869 --> 08:10.770
and the medications
Dr. Elmore prescribed...

08:10.804 --> 08:12.572
They made the nightmares go away.

08:12.606 --> 08:14.674
Gone but not forgotten.

08:14.692 --> 08:16.943
I think that everything
that's happening now

08:16.945 --> 08:19.746
can be traced back to that
nightmare you had as a little girl.

08:22.750 --> 08:27.687
You drew this, the other morning.

08:27.721 --> 08:29.872
You drew this when you were 7.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.601
It's the name of a book.

08:41.635 --> 08:44.003
<i>Unseen Forces: An
Unabridged & Personal History</i>

08:44.038 --> 08:45.838
<i>of Ravenswood Township.</i>

08:45.873 --> 08:48.808
By its native son H. A. Armitage.

08:48.842 --> 08:50.643
Like, Armitage High School?

08:50.678 --> 08:52.779
<i>"Unseen Forces."</i>

08:52.813 --> 08:54.547
Maybe she's sending me a playbook.

08:54.581 --> 08:56.883
If Armitage wrote it, the school
library has to have a copy.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.851
Yeah.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.824
Are you coming with me?

09:06.894 --> 09:08.561
I didn't remember any of it

09:08.579 --> 09:10.663
until the doctor showed me that drawing.

09:10.698 --> 09:11.948
The nightmare was always the same.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.499
A man standing near my bed.

09:13.534 --> 09:15.568
All shadows and intention.

09:15.586 --> 09:16.947
He had the knife in his hand, Luke.

09:17.971 --> 09:19.589
The same three-sided blade

09:19.623 --> 09:20.773
that preacher had at the pact signing.

09:20.808 --> 09:25.878
So somewhere between
sealing a pact a century ago,

09:25.913 --> 09:28.748
and being dug up in my yard yesterday,

09:28.782 --> 09:31.784
this knife was in your nightmare
as a kid? How's that possible?

09:32.953 --> 09:34.854
Because the first time it happened,

09:34.888 --> 09:37.857
he was actually there in my
room. As real as you and me.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.796
So this nightmare, your
bogeyman, it's a memory?

09:43.831 --> 09:45.732
Crazy, right?

09:45.766 --> 09:48.668
A couple of weeks ago, it
would have sounded crazy.

09:48.702 --> 09:50.937
- Now...
- (phone ringing)

09:53.874 --> 09:56.809
Hey, Liv, what's up?

09:56.844 --> 09:57.844
Take it.

09:57.878 --> 09:59.712
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:04.017 --> 10:05.835
Clark say anything about the knife?

10:05.886 --> 10:07.670
They're still testing it.

10:07.721 --> 10:09.622
That's why I want to talk to Springer.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.624
Olivia, the guy attacked you.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.810
I thought he was angry or
drunk when he chased me.

10:13.844 --> 10:16.729
Now, I think he felt guilty about something

10:16.764 --> 10:18.765
and he was trying to tell me about it.

10:18.799 --> 10:19.999
Where's Springer now?

10:20.033 --> 10:21.667
He is in his own room.

10:21.702 --> 10:23.736
Tess is trying to find out which one.

10:24.972 --> 10:25.988
Look, you go up to Remy.

10:26.023 --> 10:27.907
If I find out anything, I'll call.

10:27.941 --> 10:29.909
Okay. Keep me posted.

10:29.943 --> 10:31.694
I will.

10:39.820 --> 10:41.921
Bad news, it's family only.

10:41.955 --> 10:43.790
Okay, so we get creative.

10:58.739 --> 11:01.774
Excuse me, what do you think you're doing?

11:01.809 --> 11:04.811
Oh, my God, Mrs. Springer,
I am so sorry I...

11:04.845 --> 11:07.647
You want to see my son?

11:07.681 --> 11:08.648
Take a look.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.017
Take a look!

11:18.725 --> 11:21.027
I thought you people were finished with us.

11:21.061 --> 11:22.795
I guess not.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.898
What is it about the Mathesons?

11:25.933 --> 11:29.552
Why are you always smashing
other people's lives?

11:32.639 --> 11:33.940
Hello, Dolores.

11:33.974 --> 11:36.976
I'm sorry to hear about your
son. Is he gonna be okay?

11:40.647 --> 11:42.682
Careful, Simon.

11:42.716 --> 11:44.684
Don't get too close to this one.

11:44.718 --> 11:46.786
You could lose everything.

11:57.948 --> 12:00.633
Why is she so angry at my family?

12:01.969 --> 12:04.003
You should ask your mother about that.

12:04.037 --> 12:05.972
I'm asking you.

12:06.006 --> 12:07.707
I saw the look on your face,

12:07.774 --> 12:09.174
you knew what she was talking about.

12:10.711 --> 12:12.912
When you work for a newspaper, Olivia,

12:12.946 --> 12:17.550
you learn the difference between
what you know and what you can prove.

12:18.619 --> 12:20.553
Mr. Beaumont, please.

12:20.587 --> 12:21.721
I don't have to tell you

12:21.755 --> 12:23.990
what the police think about my mom.

12:24.024 --> 12:26.592
If you know something about any of this...

12:33.667 --> 12:34.934
Before your dad was the mayor,

12:34.968 --> 12:36.669
he was the city attorney.

12:36.703 --> 12:38.037
I know that.

12:38.071 --> 12:41.007
Springer's dad is in jail because of him.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.976
Springer's dad? I thought...

12:44.011 --> 12:49.582
I know. Dolores raised the boy herself.

12:49.616 --> 12:50.856
He never knew about his father.

12:52.953 --> 12:54.654
But he found out.

12:55.822 --> 12:57.657
Someone told him.

12:57.691 --> 12:58.925
That's why he's turned on my family.

12:58.959 --> 13:00.693
Your dad was just doing his job.

13:00.727 --> 13:02.595
And he was good at it.

13:02.629 --> 13:04.730
But when you gets things
done as a politician...

13:06.967 --> 13:08.601
you make enemies.

13:22.352 --> 13:24.438
Hey, it's still storming in Chicago.

13:24.464 --> 13:26.237
Your mother's stuck at the airport.

13:26.271 --> 13:28.005
Tell her I'm fine please.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.307
I will.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.048
How are you feeling?

13:37.082 --> 13:38.449
I'm exhausted, I'm wired,

13:38.483 --> 13:40.318
and I'm scared.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.053
Sorry about the wires,

13:42.087 --> 13:44.355
I swear we're not hooking
you up to the Matrix.

13:44.389 --> 13:48.492
Well, this place is pretty,
you know, it's comfy.

13:48.527 --> 13:52.029
Like Stanley Kubrick's guest room?

13:52.064 --> 13:53.164
Remember this,

13:53.198 --> 13:55.066
all the wires release at once.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.034
I'll be right outside the
monitoring station when you wake up.

13:57.069 --> 13:59.487
Liam, it's 4:00 p.m., I'm
not going to be able to sleep.

13:59.521 --> 14:02.306
Everyone says that, everyone sleeps.

14:02.324 --> 14:05.076
Bet you a ten spot.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.344
Easy money.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.196
- Almost done, Liam?
- Yeah.

14:12.034 --> 14:13.167
I'll be outside.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.003
Okay.

14:18.323 --> 14:21.425
This first sleep period is a control.

14:21.460 --> 14:25.229
No drugs, no stimuli.

14:25.263 --> 14:28.165
Your pulse is racing. What's on your mind?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.135
My nightmare as a child,

14:31.169 --> 14:34.205
I remember it now, it felt so... so real.

14:34.239 --> 14:38.142
You suffered what's called
a hypnagogic hallucination.

14:38.176 --> 14:39.477
Essentially the body wakes up,

14:39.511 --> 14:41.112
but the mind is still dreaming.

14:41.146 --> 14:43.014
So even though my eyes were open

14:43.048 --> 14:45.149
and it felt absolutely real?

14:45.183 --> 14:46.250
Your mind fooled you.

14:46.284 --> 14:49.286
Therapy is gonna help you
resolve that nightmare.

14:49.321 --> 14:52.423
But for now, let's just
try and get some rest.

15:17.049 --> 15:20.117
(birds chirping)

15:25.023 --> 15:27.058
(sighs)

15:27.092 --> 15:29.460
Are you sure you want to do this?

15:29.494 --> 15:32.296
I can't protect you if
I'm hiding in that house.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.265
Protect me?

15:36.401 --> 15:40.504
I mean, you, like... all of you...

15:42.474 --> 15:45.109
Just promise me,

15:45.143 --> 15:48.212
if you see something weird or strange...

15:52.084 --> 15:53.350
I promise.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.068
(crows cawing)

16:21.413 --> 16:23.280
(gate closes)

16:34.226 --> 16:35.459
Liam, you owe me ten bucks.

16:41.099 --> 16:42.233
Liam?

17:50.168 --> 17:52.069
(growling)

17:55.040 --> 17:56.340
Get away from her!

17:57.260 --> 17:58.302
You heard me.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.318
(exhales)

18:14.192 --> 18:16.994
See? Everyone sleeps.

18:24.169 --> 18:27.171
Hi. Excuse me.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.290
Yeah, my mom was just in a car accident,

18:29.341 --> 18:33.177
and she came in here with
some kind of sternal fracture.

18:33.211 --> 18:36.247
The last name is Merriwether.

18:36.281 --> 18:40.632
M-E-R-R, you
know, Merriwether.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.159
(whispers) Springer?

18:51.029 --> 18:52.029
Springer?

19:00.272 --> 19:02.172
(cell phone chimes)

20:00.465 --> 20:03.033
<i>SPRINGER: I planted the
knife, wasn't that enough?</i>

20:03.068 --> 20:05.069
<i>MAN: Shut up...</i>

20:14.792 --> 20:16.693
This is Springer's voice on it,

20:16.727 --> 20:18.695
but I don't know who he's talking to.

20:18.729 --> 20:22.699
Okay. I'll take a look at it.

20:22.733 --> 20:24.617
How's Remy?

20:24.652 --> 20:26.132
They haven't figured out anything yet.

20:27.671 --> 20:28.771
Hey.

20:31.575 --> 20:32.842
I took the plunge.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.614
No, they can't see me.

20:37.648 --> 20:39.749
I'm still a closely guarded secret,

20:39.783 --> 20:42.618
but at least I can get
out of that damn cemetery.

20:45.489 --> 20:47.724
Hey, how's Remy?

20:47.758 --> 20:49.492
Luke's with her.

20:49.527 --> 20:51.795
Meantime, I talked to
Remy's dad about Springer.

20:51.829 --> 20:54.464
CALEB: What'd he say?

20:54.498 --> 20:55.598
Apparently when my dad was city attorney,

20:55.633 --> 20:56.900
he ended up being responsible

20:56.934 --> 20:58.454
for sending Springer's dad to prison...

20:59.603 --> 21:00.537
No!

21:03.641 --> 21:05.708
It was a secret that he even had a son.

21:05.743 --> 21:07.660
Someone must have found
out and told Springer,

21:07.695 --> 21:09.863
and that's why he has this
thing against my family.

21:13.717 --> 21:15.668
(screams)

21:15.703 --> 21:17.754
- What?
- Are you okay?

21:25.546 --> 21:27.430
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:27.465 --> 21:29.899
I'm fine.

21:34.872 --> 21:36.739
It was the same nightmare,

21:36.774 --> 21:38.675
but this time I was observing it.

21:38.709 --> 21:40.910
- Was he there? Your bogeyman?
- Yeah.

21:40.945 --> 21:42.545
I tried the lucid dreaming thing

21:42.580 --> 21:43.847
to make him go away.

21:43.881 --> 21:45.648
He wasn't even fazed by it.

21:46.817 --> 21:49.486
You still think he's real?

21:49.520 --> 21:51.821
I don't even know what real means
anymore, but he's not a part of me.

21:51.856 --> 21:53.590
But we know he's part of the curse.

21:53.624 --> 21:55.542
We barely survived his real world attacks.

21:55.576 --> 21:56.826
Who knows what he can do in your mind?

21:56.861 --> 21:58.795
But what if he has answers?

21:58.829 --> 22:01.548
What if he knows who used
that knife to kill your father?

22:02.833 --> 22:05.768
What if it's a trap?

22:05.803 --> 22:07.570
At least we have home field advantage.

22:07.605 --> 22:09.772
Rem, you're exhausted.

22:09.807 --> 22:12.442
If Dr. Russell can give you
something that will help you rest...

22:12.476 --> 22:13.610
Whoever he is, he's not
going to let me rest.

22:13.644 --> 22:14.777
(sighs)

22:16.480 --> 22:18.648
I've seen too much.

22:18.682 --> 22:21.484
(bell ringing)

22:34.732 --> 22:36.833
You know, Mr. Price has
some strange hobbies.

22:36.867 --> 22:39.602
That's why the librarian sent us here.

22:39.637 --> 22:40.803
A book like that gets checked out

22:40.838 --> 22:42.505
and doesn't get checked back in.

22:42.540 --> 22:44.774
You got to think a major
history buff might have it.

22:47.545 --> 22:48.511
Here it is.

22:57.888 --> 22:59.689
Looks like a bunch of dense stuff

22:59.723 --> 23:01.758
on hauntings and sightings.

23:04.695 --> 23:07.564
If you're looking for ghost stories,

23:07.598 --> 23:09.599
<i>Lovecraft is a lot more fun.</i>

23:11.535 --> 23:13.603
Mr. Price, I'm sorry.

23:15.873 --> 23:17.457
You're one of Remy's friends?

23:17.491 --> 23:20.543
Right. Caleb Rivers.

23:20.578 --> 23:22.445
I'm starting here tomorrow as a student.

23:22.479 --> 23:24.814
Well, Caleb Rivers, that
still doesn't explain

23:24.848 --> 23:27.617
what you're doing in my office today.

23:27.651 --> 23:31.421
Yeah, somebody recommended a book to me,

23:31.455 --> 23:33.623
about the town, and the librarian

23:33.657 --> 23:35.625
seemed to think that you may have it.

23:35.659 --> 23:38.428
Did you ever consider sending an e-mail,

23:38.462 --> 23:39.862
or is breaking and
entering your go-to move?

23:39.897 --> 23:42.498
You know, I entered, but
I didn't actually break.

23:45.536 --> 23:47.737
<i>Unseen Forces by H. A. Armitage.</i>

23:49.523 --> 23:52.508
Well, you will not find anything
useful about the town in there.

23:52.543 --> 23:53.576
Why not?

23:53.611 --> 23:56.479
Henry Armitage was a great benefactor,

23:56.513 --> 23:58.514
he was also a world-class eccentric

23:58.549 --> 24:02.518
who was heavy into
mysticism and the occult.

24:02.553 --> 24:03.853
So, Armitage believed in ghosts.

24:03.887 --> 24:04.854
Do you?

24:06.657 --> 24:11.461
I try to keep an open mind.

24:11.495 --> 24:12.535
I'm not one of those people

24:12.563 --> 24:14.564
that finds ghosts all that romantic.

24:14.598 --> 24:16.799
People are so empty and miserable

24:16.834 --> 24:19.402
that they just keep going on after death.

24:19.436 --> 24:22.705
Well, if you were dead and
you were sticking around,

24:22.740 --> 24:24.607
maybe there was a reason,

24:24.642 --> 24:27.477
maybe there was something you had to do.

24:27.511 --> 24:29.812
- Unfinished business?
- I suppose.

24:29.847 --> 24:32.682
But then some people never finished
anything when they were alive.

24:32.716 --> 24:36.452
What makes you think they'd be
any better at it when they're dead?

24:36.487 --> 24:39.622
Maybe they could do better
with a friend who's still alive.

24:39.657 --> 24:42.458
One foot in both worlds?

24:42.493 --> 24:44.560
Seems like one hell of a team

24:44.595 --> 24:45.895
if the ghost brought anything to the table.

24:45.929 --> 24:48.665
But all the ghost stories
I know are all about

24:48.699 --> 24:50.767
rattling chains and cheap parlor tricks.

24:52.703 --> 24:54.783
I don't think they could
ever really help the living.

24:55.639 --> 24:56.589
Excuse me.

24:59.910 --> 25:02.478
- (growling)
- (Gasps)

25:04.548 --> 25:05.815
Welcome to Henry Armitage High.

25:13.590 --> 25:14.824
(elevator bell dings)

25:22.566 --> 25:24.534
(clearing throat)

25:24.568 --> 25:26.198
I'm looking for Zachary Springer.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.988
Olivia.

25:35.022 --> 25:35.989
Come here.

25:37.708 --> 25:38.959
What?

25:38.993 --> 25:40.994
- (whispering) What are you doing?
- Look.

25:44.732 --> 25:46.132
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

25:46.167 --> 25:47.968
I don't even know how he got in there.

25:48.002 --> 25:50.870
This is crazy.

25:58.012 --> 25:58.979
Come on.

26:01.899 --> 26:03.700
<i>Woman: (on PA) Code Blue.</i>

26:03.734 --> 26:07.654
<i>Code Blue ICU 179. Code Blue ICU 179.</i>

26:07.688 --> 26:10.957
(clamoring)

26:16.897 --> 26:18.631
These will help me sleep?

26:18.666 --> 26:20.667
Just a stronger version of melatonin.

26:20.701 --> 26:22.969
They ought to help you get
some uninterrupted rest.

26:23.004 --> 26:24.704
But I'll still dream?

26:24.739 --> 26:25.739
Of course.

26:25.773 --> 26:27.094
What good is sleep without dreams?

26:43.858 --> 26:47.660
You know, I was wrong about Luke.

26:47.695 --> 26:49.696
He really cares about you.

26:51.065 --> 26:52.906
That was really hard for
you to say, wasn't it?

26:52.933 --> 26:54.100
Excruciating.

26:54.135 --> 26:55.135
(chuckles)

27:02.977 --> 27:03.943
Mr. Beaumont.

27:03.978 --> 27:06.012
Luke.

27:11.886 --> 27:16.623
If you get in any trouble, I
want you to wake yourself up.

27:16.657 --> 27:18.058
Promise me.

27:20.094 --> 27:21.628
Okay.

27:21.662 --> 27:25.065
Let's go. Come on.

27:25.099 --> 27:27.700
Okay, and be safe please.

27:27.735 --> 27:28.935
Okay.

28:22.756 --> 28:25.758
I know you're here. Come on out.

28:37.071 --> 28:38.638
Sorry to disappoint you,

28:38.672 --> 28:40.807
but I'm missing the
scared-of-clowns gene.

28:55.022 --> 28:57.657
Okay then.

29:01.929 --> 29:04.831
Dr. Russell. Her vitals spiked
and her EEG is displaying

29:04.865 --> 29:06.666
some unusual brain activity.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.001
Is Remy okay?

29:08.035 --> 29:10.737
Remy's fine. She's dreaming.

29:14.742 --> 29:16.876
- What is... what is...
- Mr. Matheson,

29:16.911 --> 29:19.078
your presence on this
ward is at my discretion.

29:20.981 --> 29:22.682
Dr. Russell.

29:22.716 --> 29:26.786
(Remy breathing heavily)

29:26.820 --> 29:28.655
- Remy.
- Call security.

29:28.689 --> 29:30.723
(Remy breathing heavily)

29:30.758 --> 29:32.859
Remy.

29:32.893 --> 29:34.994
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

29:35.029 --> 29:36.913
Mr. Matheson, come with me please.

29:36.947 --> 29:38.081
- Let go of her.
- She's not waking up.

29:38.115 --> 29:39.766
She's fine.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.634
- What's going on?
- Remy's not in distress,

29:41.669 --> 29:43.230
she's simply in a deeper stage of sleep.

29:50.844 --> 29:51.794
Remy.

30:05.926 --> 30:08.027
You take it sweet, as I recall.

30:18.571 --> 30:20.472
You okay?

30:21.608 --> 30:22.574
Sure.

30:25.612 --> 30:26.845
There has to be another copy of that book

30:26.880 --> 30:28.547
somewhere in this town.

30:29.616 --> 30:30.582
Whatever.

30:31.718 --> 30:33.519
Miranda.

30:42.862 --> 30:45.497
I wanted to be

30:45.532 --> 30:47.733
so brave for you guys.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.568
I wanted to do all the missions,

30:49.602 --> 30:51.737
and... keep you safe.

30:53.873 --> 30:56.675
I think that would have
made me feel like somebody.

30:56.709 --> 30:58.977
Hey, you are somebody.

30:59.012 --> 31:01.680
Miranda, we're going to
figure this out together, okay?

31:01.714 --> 31:02.815
Me and you.

31:02.849 --> 31:05.717
I saw you first, that
has to mean something.

31:05.752 --> 31:09.655
Caleb, you don't have to keep doing this.

31:10.790 --> 31:11.757
Doing what?

31:11.791 --> 31:12.891
Playing house with me.

31:14.761 --> 31:16.595
At some point you're going
to move in with your dad,

31:16.629 --> 31:19.665
and you're gonna meet
some new girls at school.

31:19.699 --> 31:22.534
Maybe I'll find a nice
dead boy to hook up with.

31:24.737 --> 31:27.606
So if the crypt is rocking...

31:29.742 --> 31:30.776
You brought it up.

31:33.546 --> 31:35.714
You're just trying to make me feel better.

31:38.651 --> 31:39.918
And how am I doing at that?

31:39.953 --> 31:42.521
I don't know.

31:42.555 --> 31:44.857
But keep trying. I like it.

31:44.891 --> 31:46.892
(cell phone ringing)

31:50.997 --> 31:52.631
Hey. How's it going?

31:52.665 --> 31:55.734
(kettle whistling)

31:56.769 --> 31:59.671
What?

31:59.706 --> 32:00.873
Unconscious?

32:00.907 --> 32:03.442
Did you want to wake her up?

32:10.583 --> 32:11.817
We've got a problem.

32:11.851 --> 32:13.535
Hey, we need to find Remy.

32:13.570 --> 32:14.653
She's at the hospital.

32:14.687 --> 32:16.755
No, Caleb, we need to find her.

32:16.789 --> 32:20.659
You were in my room that
night when I was 7, why?

32:20.693 --> 32:23.562
Keeping track of the lambs.

32:23.596 --> 32:25.664
But why choose me, or any of us?

32:25.698 --> 32:27.933
Are we the smartest, the weakest?

32:27.967 --> 32:30.836
Are our names written on little
white balls spinning in a cage?

32:30.870 --> 32:33.672
It's certainly not random.

32:37.877 --> 32:40.545
- Debts are owed.
- The pact.

32:40.580 --> 32:42.547
You should not have seen.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.754
So what happened to Springer?

32:49.856 --> 32:51.790
I heard them say it was a blood clot.

32:51.824 --> 32:54.826
But Collins was in there
right before it happened.

32:54.861 --> 32:57.562
I wonder if he stepped
on a couple of tubes.

32:57.597 --> 32:58.730
Is Springer still alive?

32:58.765 --> 33:02.501
Yeah, he is. I just sort of know.

33:02.535 --> 33:03.695
And what's going on with Remy?

33:03.703 --> 33:04.736
They can't wake her up.

33:09.742 --> 33:11.877
You've always been special to me.

33:11.911 --> 33:14.646
Because I woke up?

33:14.681 --> 33:17.649
I saw you holding the knife
you used to kill Luke's dad.

33:17.684 --> 33:20.552
I'm the dealmaker. I'm not the murderer.

33:20.586 --> 33:22.454
Then who is? Mr. Collins?

33:22.488 --> 33:24.523
The town does its part.

33:24.557 --> 33:26.792
Enough with the cryptic Q&A.

33:26.826 --> 33:29.628
I don't care how you picked
us, we broke your damn pact.

33:29.662 --> 33:32.597
You broke nothing.

33:32.632 --> 33:33.865
We're alive.

33:33.900 --> 33:36.935
Some of you, for the moment,

33:36.970 --> 33:38.937
but things change.

33:38.972 --> 33:41.840
Accidents, illnesses.

33:41.874 --> 33:45.677
Sometimes people even die in their sleep.

33:47.780 --> 33:50.983
Would you like to know why you?

33:52.852 --> 33:54.753
Because you're full of fear.

33:54.787 --> 33:57.856
It makes you irresistible.

33:57.890 --> 34:00.792
Your boyfriend wants someone else,

34:00.827 --> 34:02.694
your father thinks you're crazy,

34:02.729 --> 34:04.696
and your mother would be a pile of ashes

34:04.731 --> 34:06.698
and dog tags if it wasn't for me!

34:08.900 --> 34:11.503
There is a debt on the books.

34:12.705 --> 34:14.672
And I always collect.

34:17.493 --> 34:20.746
(rapid beeping)

34:21.781 --> 34:23.748
Remy, wake up.

34:23.783 --> 34:25.534
Just clear her airway.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.588
Get me 1s of Lorazepam.

34:31.489 --> 34:32.858
I'll need a blood pressure read.

34:34.659 --> 34:35.781
I'll be right back. 1 second.

34:35.795 --> 34:38.630
- Is she all right?
- She's not waking up.

34:38.664 --> 34:40.899
I don't think they know what's
going on. What do you think?

34:40.933 --> 34:42.774
I think there's something
keeping her in there.

34:48.775 --> 34:50.726
Once we get this blood pressure reading,

34:50.777 --> 34:53.745
we have to check her pupils.

34:57.850 --> 34:59.584
111/86.

35:00.870 --> 35:02.821
Non-responsive.

35:02.855 --> 35:05.690
Get the tube ready, I think
we're going to have to intubate.

35:13.916 --> 35:15.834
(horn honking)

35:19.505 --> 35:21.573
Pluck it out!

35:21.607 --> 35:22.841
Done the right thing.

35:28.848 --> 35:30.715
You want to know about this knife?

35:40.860 --> 35:43.829
How did it seal the pact?

35:43.863 --> 35:46.498
Who used it to kill Luke's father?

35:48.901 --> 35:51.670
Who buried it in their backyard?

35:52.705 --> 35:56.741
(knife spinning)

35:56.776 --> 35:58.844
First tell me...

36:01.848 --> 36:04.416
how did you witness the pact?

36:11.924 --> 36:13.725
You don't know?

36:16.529 --> 36:18.563
Who helped you?

36:28.774 --> 36:29.774
Let's go.

36:36.849 --> 36:38.850
Miranda? How are you here?

36:38.885 --> 36:41.720
That's a really good question for later.

36:44.557 --> 36:45.857
You got a lot of clothes.

36:45.892 --> 36:49.594
I don't know where that goes.

36:49.629 --> 36:51.596
(growling)

37:02.475 --> 37:03.542
(screams)

37:03.576 --> 37:04.860
Go!

37:09.749 --> 37:11.616
You must have read a lot of
Narnia books when you were little.

37:11.650 --> 37:12.784
Yeah, sorry.

37:19.508 --> 37:20.491
That way.

37:26.599 --> 37:28.700
Is this the way out?

37:28.734 --> 37:29.734
You tell me.

37:29.769 --> 37:32.503
It's your dream.

37:33.739 --> 37:36.858
(footsteps approaching)

37:36.893 --> 37:38.727
Okay, Remy, on three.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.745
One...

37:40.780 --> 37:42.680
two... three.

37:42.698 --> 37:45.817
(screaming)

37:49.555 --> 37:52.591
(gasping)

37:52.625 --> 37:54.876
You are more trouble than you are worth.

37:54.911 --> 37:56.578
You have no idea.

37:56.629 --> 37:58.713
Well, then let's get better acquainted.

37:58.748 --> 38:00.415
We have an eternity.

38:00.466 --> 38:02.584
You know what, I may not
know how all of this works,

38:02.635 --> 38:04.869
the dream hacking...

38:04.887 --> 38:08.423
but at least I know when
I've overstayed my welcome.

38:08.474 --> 38:11.559
Get out of my friend's
head, you son of a bitch.

38:11.594 --> 38:14.679
(screaming)

38:19.420 --> 38:21.621
So they're really letting you go home, huh?

38:21.655 --> 38:23.556
Th was only a 24-hour observation.

38:23.591 --> 38:26.326
They've got a ton of
readings to sift through.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.594
I doubt they're going to get

38:27.628 --> 38:29.362
the real story from your brain waves.

38:29.397 --> 38:31.364
I don't know if Miranda
moved the needle out here,

38:31.399 --> 38:33.400
but she saved my life in there.

38:33.434 --> 38:35.235
She's pretty handy for a dead girl.

38:38.506 --> 38:40.540
The knife was right in front of me.

38:40.574 --> 38:42.675
I'm sorry I couldn't find
out who killed your dad.

38:44.645 --> 38:46.212
You almost died trying.

38:47.648 --> 38:49.282
No answers are worth that.

38:52.519 --> 38:54.287
The knife is important to him.

38:54.321 --> 38:55.642
It's what he makes his deals with.

38:57.558 --> 39:00.527
Then maybe we can use
it to break this deal.

39:07.401 --> 39:09.169
And then I lost him in the dark,

39:09.203 --> 39:11.387
and we were falling.

39:11.422 --> 39:13.406
But he's gone? You evicted him?

39:13.441 --> 39:15.375
Well, he's been around for a century.

39:15.409 --> 39:18.344
I doubt if my newbie abilities
banished him for good.

39:18.379 --> 39:22.549
But maybe at least Remy can get
a good night's sleep for once.

39:25.286 --> 39:26.419
You did good out there.

39:28.389 --> 39:30.356
I'm just glad I could do something.

39:30.391 --> 39:32.392
You know, I was thinking
about what Price said.

39:33.527 --> 39:36.496
There's lots of books out there, but...

39:36.530 --> 39:39.365
this story, it hasn't been written yet.

39:40.501 --> 39:42.268
Caleb.

39:42.303 --> 39:44.337
(laptop dings)

39:47.341 --> 39:50.477
Looks like Olivia's
audio file is a dead end.

39:51.612 --> 39:53.680
I hope she gets some answers.

39:53.714 --> 39:56.349
She will.

39:56.383 --> 39:58.351
Right now I need to get some sleep.

39:58.385 --> 39:59.466
It's a school day, remember?

39:59.487 --> 40:01.638
Well, for some of us.

40:05.559 --> 40:07.360
Wake me up in an hour.

40:32.586 --> 40:34.337
Olivia.

40:36.657 --> 40:37.657
Hi.

40:40.461 --> 40:41.628
Do you remember anything?

40:44.532 --> 40:45.698
You need to know...

40:45.733 --> 40:48.468
I know about your dad.

40:48.502 --> 40:51.538
I'm so sorry how that went down.

40:53.574 --> 40:55.708
But why?

40:55.743 --> 40:59.679
Why did you put that knife in my yard?

40:59.713 --> 41:01.548
Was it just revenge?

41:04.351 --> 41:06.352
He made me do it.

41:06.387 --> 41:08.688
All of it.

41:08.722 --> 41:10.623
Who?

41:13.460 --> 41:14.561
Dillon.

41:18.465 --> 41:19.666
Um...

41:19.700 --> 41:22.702
(ventilator beeping rapidly)
