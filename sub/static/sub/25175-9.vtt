Two m/7/ion Muslims

00:04.610 --> 00:07.659
are converging on Saudi Arabia
this week for the Hay]:

00:07.770 --> 00:09.783
I gotta go.
I have some work
I need to deal with.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.539
So an element within the CIA

00:11.650 --> 00:13.470
staged the attack
of ComQuest Field.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.992
-That's fucking crazy.
-We gotta get you out of here.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.954
Caleb has the power
to expose this thing.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.357
Caleb's too trusting.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.234
-That's why he has me.
-[clatters]

00:21.340 --> 00:23.319
I won't report it stolen
for 24 hours.

What are you saying right now?

00:27.030 --> 00:29.169
I was trying
to hurt Mae Barber.

00:29.270 --> 00:30.806
Her husband killed my husband.

00:30.910 --> 00:31.968
No, he didn't.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.652

00:38.160 --> 00:39.331
Are you going after Joubert?

00:39.440 --> 00:41.055
Christ, she's
a professional killer.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.696
That's what
all the guns are for.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.062
[Joe]
I need to talk to Janice.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.626
And I need her
to talk to Caleb.

00:45.730 --> 00:47.027
[Paul]
Janice isn ’t
with Caleb anymore.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.586
I'm not looking for
a fucking fight.

[both grunting]

00:49.890 --> 00:51.380
You know, I read your file.

00:51.490 --> 00:52.627
I'm sure you left
something out.

00:52.730 --> 00:54.732

You seem tense.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.531
[indistinct chatter]

02:21.660 --> 02:23.651
They're coming for me again.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.181
It's Thanksgiving.

02:29.830 --> 02:31.764
[Swede]
They'll want to celebrate.

02:31.870 --> 02:34.896
These monsters

02:35.000 --> 02:37.093

from the world,

02:37.200 --> 02:39.839
but they still
keep track of the holidays.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.871
Especially the American ones.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.582
Don't think about it.

02:49.690 --> 02:51.681
[Deacon] Doesn't matter
if I think about it or not.

02:53.610 --> 02:55.271
They're still gonna come.

02:55.380 --> 02:56.790
So they will come.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.310
Wounds heal.

02:58.420 --> 02:59.990
[Swede]
The ones on the outside.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.831
Thats why it’s so important
to protect the mind.

03:03.940 --> 03:06.659
Where do you like to go
during a good beating?

03:07.590 --> 03:10.343
I go to the beach.

03:11.950 --> 03:14.009
Malibu.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.816
[German] You're being morose.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.935
Thanksgiving means
Christmas is close.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.497
Ibrahim said
we will be released by then.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.739
Ibrahim knows
you long for freedom,

03:23.840 --> 03:26.308
so he says you will be free.

03:26.410 --> 03:28.583
It's not just your body
he tortures.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.066
He told the Finn
he would be free,

03:30.170 --> 03:31.865
the money came
and he was freed.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.404
Maybe they took him out back
and cut his head off.

03:35.460 --> 03:38.031
We never leave this room.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.734
For all we know,
we've been eating
the Finn for dinner.

03:41.940 --> 03:43.828
Finn for dinner.

03:43.940 --> 03:45.521
We will be free.

03:45.630 --> 03:46.847
[Swede] Finn-er.

03:46.950 --> 03:48.838
Yeah.

03:48.950 --> 03:51.885
Have you been eating poorly?
You're looking very Finn.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.981
No. I saw the future.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.292
In a dream.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.617
You were with a woman.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.711
Dressed entirely in black.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.736
What are you doing?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.910
[Swede] I don't want to hear
about your dreams.

04:05.850 --> 04:07.659

there's fucking in them.

You think I'm a monster?

04:46.730 --> 04:49.688

and you say,
"I can never be that."

04:59.140 --> 05:01.597

of a hole in the ground.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.691
But I was a teacher.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.780
I taught small children.
Most of whom are dead now.

05:08.150 --> 05:10.368
Now you are my students.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.461
I'm going to introduce you
to someone.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.941
Yourself.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.789
The person that's
just been inside you
all this time.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.031
Waiting.

can walk out of here alive?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.337
Sorry to call you
directly, sir.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.250
But given the circumstances,
I didn't know who else to call.

Don't leave!

How should I handle it?

10:27.300 --> 10:28.597
[Abbott over phone]
I’ll handle it myself.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.702
Yes, sir, I understand.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.951
I've got an errand to run.

are you doing here?

12:39.070 --> 12:40.879
You know what the fuck
I'm doing here, Janice.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.173
You need to talk to Caleb.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.178
Did you call the police?

12:43.280 --> 12:45.271
Where were you last night?

12:47.280 --> 12:48.338
What?

12:48.440 --> 12:50.431
Don't look at him.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.802
Answer my question.
Where were you last night?

12:55.330 --> 12:57.662
-Listen, I--
-So it's true.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.761
You're living
this secret fucking life.

13:00.770 --> 13:02.772
And secret from me.

13:05.860 --> 13:08.033
I wanted to tell you.

13:08.140 --> 13:11.359
And here I was trying to tell
my wife's ex-boyfriend

13:11.460 --> 13:12.563
that he didn't know
shit about her,

13:12.670 --> 13:13.819
but it's really me who
doesn't know shit about you.

13:13.910 --> 13:15.446
Look, I'm sorry,
but this is more important

13:15.550 --> 13:16.380
than what's going on
between the two of you.

13:16.470 --> 13:18.165
-Fuck you, man!
-Janice, I need--

13:18.270 --> 13:19.407
[sighs] Look.

13:19.510 --> 13:21.762
Caleb wanted us
to work this out together.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.019
You stopped him
for better of for worse.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.896
Caleb doesn't always know
what's best for him.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.991
Kind of like you.

Caleb?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.940
Right.

13:33.050 --> 13:34.779
You used to brag to everyone
how open we were.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.346
Millions of people could die.

13:36.450 --> 13:38.782
How we knew ever little thing.

13:38.890 --> 13:41.347
[Janice] I swear to you
I did not think it was
going to go on this long.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.270
-It's--
-[glass shatters]

13:43.380 --> 13:44.597
Fuck.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.429
Call him, Janice.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.610
-Please.
-No.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.717
This is more important

13:50.820 --> 13:53.402
than what went down between us
SIX fucking years ago.

13:53.510 --> 13:55.046
What is?
What is more important?

13:55.150 --> 13:56.606
Am I experiencing deja vu?

13:56.710 --> 13:58.405
You don't even know
what's gorng on.

13:58.510 --> 14:00.239
What exactly do you want
Caleb to say?

14:00.350 --> 14:03.376
That there's
some kind of person out there,
maybe the CIA,

14:03.480 --> 14:06.495
they're planning
some kind of an attack
in the Middle East

14:06.600 --> 14:09.091
and it's big and it's bad,
but we do't really know
shit about it.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.849
-It's better
than doing nothing.
-Really? Better for who?

14:10.960 --> 14:12.496
Janice, we are talking
about a loss of life

14:12.600 --> 14:14.659
on a scale normally reserved
for a fucking ice age.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.385
You went to go work
for the CIA, Joe,

14:16.490 --> 14:18.003

a thing that come out of--
-[Joe] Oh, God.

all those people dIe
than forgive me?

[shouts] Which people?
Which people?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.430
Fuck, you're
a petty fucking bitch.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.030
And you're
a self-righteous asshole.

14:25.140 --> 14:28.109
It's the Hajj.
And don't call my wife a bitch.

Joubert's dirty.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.364
So you were gonna
add vigilante justice

20:02.470 --> 20:04.802
to the list of stupid things
you did this week,

20:07.880 --> 20:08.790
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.575
Oh, don't even try and deny it.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.693
You are either working for Bob

20:12.800 --> 20:14.813
or you were coincidentally
assigned to a case

20:14.920 --> 20:16.911
involving your
own dead girlfriend.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.829
I should get a lawyer.

_ I think we're
a little past lawyers,
don't you?

20:28.940 --> 20:31.750
Look, the fact that
you're working for Bob

20:31.860 --> 20:35.239
actually makes you
one of the few people
that I can trust right now.

20:35.340 --> 20:36.830
I was given this case

20:36.940 --> 20:40.159
because someone knew
I had an ax to grind
against Bob Partridge.

20:40.270 --> 20:41.840
But I would never
give that son of a bitch

20:41.950 --> 20:44.862
the satisfaction
of throwmg the case
just because I hated the man.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.912
That's why now, more than ever,

20:48.640 --> 20:50.631
I need to get to the truth.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.391
Were you really gonna kill her?

21:06.410 --> 21:08.412
I don't know.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.279
[exhales]

21:11.380 --> 21:13.371
Look”.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.936
I get that
this is personal for you,

21:17.380 --> 21:18.961
but just because
we're beyond lawyers

21:19.070 --> 21:21.061
doesn't mean that
we're beyond the law.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.645
Not yet aanay.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.741
Got it?

21:28.350 --> 21:30.329
If we're gonna do this,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.431
we're gonna do it by the book.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.311
Yeah.

21:38.730 --> 21:39.867
Okay.

21:39.970 --> 21:41.961
[car lock chimes]

21:45.970 --> 21:47.619
[line ringing]

21:47.730 --> 21:49.732
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

21:56.340 --> 21:58.922
[Mae over phone]
Sammy, I’m not
trying to smother you.

21:59.030 --> 22:00.918
I know you ’re going through
some shit right now.

22:01.030 --> 22:02.964
We all are.

22:03.070 --> 22:04.958
Look, I don’t
need you to come home
if you ’re somewhere safe,

22:05.070 --> 22:06.924
butI do need you
to return my calls, okay?

22:07.030 --> 22:09.032
Okay, I love you.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.071
[knock on door]

22:51.080 --> 22:53.071
What are you doing here?

22:53.520 --> 22:54.896
I know that you've seen it.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.538
So there's no point
in my beating around the bush.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.505
Seen what?

23:00.610 --> 23:02.601
No point in
you lying about it either.

23:04.090 --> 23:06.388
I'm here because
Sam was my friend and my ally,

23:06.490 --> 23:09.163
and as I told you before,
we take care of our own.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.149
Sam died

23:12.260 --> 23:15.559
trying to save the life
of his best friend.

23:15.660 --> 23:18.311
But, um, he never
betrayed our cause,
and that is why I'm here now

23:18.420 --> 23:20.866
trying to preserve
what's left of his family.

23:23.030 --> 23:25.021
I can only do it
with your help, Mae.

23:26.550 --> 23:28.541
I know that you've seen it.

23:29.030 --> 23:30.816
Now I'd like you to unsee it.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.911
Go get it for me,
put it in my hand,

23:33.840 --> 23:35.831
and let that be the end of it.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.805
Once you accused me
of threatening your family.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.641
At that time,
it was the furthest thing
from my mind.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.752
[cell phone buzzing]

24:17.560 --> 24:19.937
I sent Manfredi to Sharla's,
but he said you were gone.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.064
Where are you?

24:21.170 --> 24:23.058
It's the Hajj.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.058
The attack is gonna be
at the Hajj.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.479
-[Joe]
And?
-I'm handling it, Joe.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.074
How?

24:31.180 --> 24:32.590
[Bob]
L/ke I would .
any other s/tuat/on

24:32.700 --> 24:34.429
that threatens to upset
the global balance of power

24:34.540 --> 24:35.791
and plunge us
into World War III.

24:35.900 --> 24:37.037
Very fucking delicately.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.710
[Joe]
Yeah, well,
I ’m handling it too.

24:38.820 --> 24:41.482
In public. I won't let this
get swept under the rug.

24:41.590 --> 24:43.842
Don't go to Caleb Wolfe, Joe.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.042
That'll just
make things messier.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.141
Just tell me where you are.

24:47.710 --> 24:49.701
[disconnects call]

25:05.170 --> 25:07.684
[Janice] Yeah. Well,
we'll be there really soon.

25:08.330 --> 25:10.321
Okay. Yeah.

25:11.660 --> 25:13.651
Yeah, I'll see you there.

25:15.940 --> 25:18.033
He's gonna meet us
at the safehouse.

25:18.140 --> 25:20.131
[Paul] You have a safehouse?

25:21.630 --> 25:23.484
Babe.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.444
I fucked up. I...

25:25.550 --> 25:28.087
I don't know what to say,
and I know
we need to talk about it.

25:28.190 --> 25:30.181
But I need to go
deal with this right now.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.379
Okay, I'm coming with you.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.459
[Janice] What? No. No.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.255
It's not up for discussion.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.338
All right, we're married,

25:37.440 --> 25:39.055
so unless _
you tell me otherWIse,

25:39.160 --> 25:41.378
we're gonna make
all our life-altering
decisions together.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.482
Okay?

25:44.330 --> 25:45.262
Yeah.

25:45.370 --> 25:47.361
Yeah. Okay.

25:48.890 --> 25:50.881
Let's go. Let's go.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.571
-You good?
-[Janice] Yeah.

25:59.580 --> 26:01.571
[shouting over TV]

26:04.350 --> 26:05.760
[guns firing on TV]

26:05.870 --> 26:07.940
[Abbott] This movie
is incredibly violent.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.511
Children should be shielded
from such things.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.238
Well, okay,
good seeing you, buster.

26:32.260 --> 26:34.399
Are we clear?

26:34.500 --> 26:36.195
Completely.

26:36.300 --> 26:39.189
You know, Melanie really
enjoyed seeing you
the other day.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.291
It lifted her spirits.

26:42.270 --> 26:44.704
I hope you'll come by
and visit us again soon.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.402
[inhales deeply]

27:07.450 --> 27:09.441
[door opening]

27:11.770 --> 27:13.192
[door closes]

27:13.300 --> 27:15.291
[light switch clicks]

27:44.210 --> 27:46.201
[groans softly]

27:48.570 --> 27:50.219
Dear Lord,

27:50.330 --> 27:52.025
please watch over
my beloved Melanie

27:52.130 --> 27:55.190
in her time
of pain and suffering.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.939
And I pray that you forgive me
for what I did to Mae today.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.354
She's a good person.

28:01.460 --> 28:03.985
And I did it with
a higher intention in mind.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.561
[Bob] I never knew

28:06.670 --> 28:09.924
if the whole pious thing
was an act,

28:10.030 --> 28:12.260
and now I find you
talking to God

28:13.760 --> 28:16.149
like a little boy
writing letters to Santa.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.370
[muffled] Hello, Bob.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.857
Did you ask God for forgiveness

28:20.960 --> 28:23.428
-when you killed my kids?
-I did.

28:23.530 --> 28:25.020
[Bob] Been a while
since Sunday school,

28:25.130 --> 28:27.018
but I don't remember God

28:27.130 --> 28:29.303
offering absolution
for murder.

28:29.410 --> 28:32.140
There is no sin so great
that God
cannot forgive it, Bob.

28:32.250 --> 28:35.174
Would God forgive me
if I splatter your brains
on your wife's bed?

28:37.020 --> 28:39.011
Absolutely.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.280
[Bob] You

28:47.390 --> 28:49.381
are cold.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.793
And it's all because
you believe
that you see God's plan.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.614
But that you see yourself
at the center of God's plan

29:00.720 --> 29:02.733
is what makes you
truly dangerous.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.182
You know, Bob,

29:04.290 --> 29:06.941
the person who has no belief

29:07.050 --> 29:09.746
and _cannot_ see
the bigger picture
is the dangerous one.

29:09.850 --> 29:11.260
How big does
a picture have to be

29:11.370 --> 29:14.214
for a person to be willing
to release a plague?

29:16.580 --> 29:19.196
It was an ingenious
plan, really.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.439
To the world it looks like
a terrorist attack

29:21.540 --> 29:23.155
that's backfired,

29:23.260 --> 29:25.262
the Muslims accuse each other

29:26.190 --> 29:28.181
of unleashing hell on them.

29:30.470 --> 29:33.280
How does a person
who believes in God

29:33.390 --> 29:36.712
come up with
such a godless plan?

29:40.680 --> 29:42.216
It's a holocaust.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.776
For them now.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.063
Or us later.

29:45.170 --> 29:47.206
-You're going to stop it.
-No, I can't stop it.

29:48.490 --> 29:50.481
Killing me certainly
wouldn't stop it.

29:51.850 --> 29:52.942
There is no red-light.

29:53.050 --> 29:54.506
No contingency plan.

29:54.610 --> 29:56.612
Of course not.

29:58.420 --> 30:02.231
Why would a fanatic
need a contingency plan?

30:02.340 --> 30:06.447
You could blow the whistle,
but that really wouldn't
accomplish much.

30:06.550 --> 30:10.020
All it would do
is discredit your country
in the eyes of the world.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.301
And probably
start World War III.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.316
We've been fighting this war
a long time.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.031
And the only way
to finally end it

30:23.920 --> 30:25.945
is to end it.

30:26.050 --> 30:28.189
There is no logic

30:28.290 --> 30:30.349
that can justify

30:30.450 --> 30:34.841
ordering a preemptive
biological attack
on innocent civilians.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.182
But now that it's underway...

30:50.190 --> 30:52.181
now that even
trying to stop it...

30:57.400 --> 31:00.016
could end our country

31:00.120 --> 31:02.509
and everything we've
lived our lives to protect,

31:05.360 --> 31:08.329
you really have taken away
all my choices.

31:09.890 --> 31:12.063
Well, maybe two men like us

31:12.170 --> 31:14.627
really can see
the same big picture after all.

31:14.730 --> 31:17.619
I could still shoot you
in the head
for killing my kids.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.091
So what's stopping you?

31:23.540 --> 31:25.531
I need you alive.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.941
For now.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.381
What's that for?

31:35.350 --> 31:37.398
Joe Turner's on his way
to Caleb Wolfe,

31:40.360 --> 31:42.248
he's going to
blow the whistle.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.351
This is our way to stop him.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.300
But I have a demand.

31:47.410 --> 31:49.184
What?

31:49.290 --> 31:51.281
My nephew.

32:14.550 --> 32:16.552
[Abbott] It's done.

32:35.450 --> 32:37.452
-[Janice] Hey.
-[Caleb] So what's the deal?

32:37.860 --> 32:39.851
Like your clubhouse, man.

32:40.180 --> 32:41.829
Brought the whole family.

32:41.940 --> 32:43.931
-Hey, Caleb.
-[Caleb] Hey.

32:46.220 --> 32:48.404
So you got my attention.

32:48.510 --> 32:50.489
[beeps]

32:50.590 --> 32:52.581
[Sharla] Joubert's on the move.

32:53.070 --> 32:54.958
[car engine starts]

32:55.070 --> 32:57.152
[intense music playing]

33:04.680 --> 33:06.534
-[tire explodes]
-[both gasp]

33:06.640 --> 33:08.642
[Marty] What the fuck?

33:09.170 --> 33:11.161
Fucking kidding me.

33:12.370 --> 33:14.258
[Sharla] The tire blew out?
How the fuck did she do that?

33:14.370 --> 33:15.667
Crazy fucking bitch.

33:15.770 --> 33:17.510
_The main access road
is an eight-minute jog
from here.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.611
We can catch a ride there.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.560
They'll wait until
the last day of the Hajj,

33:28.670 --> 33:30.649
so no one's symptomatic
until they're home.

33:30.750 --> 33:32.559
They'll spread the epidemic
as far as possible.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.206
You have a sketch
of a covert action,

33:37.680 --> 33:39.830
Yeah, but it is a lot of smoke.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.739
What do you think
will happen ifI announce

33:43.840 --> 33:45.774
that the CIA's planning
to release a plague
at the Hajj?

33:45.880 --> 33:47.620
They'll call it off.

33:47.730 --> 33:49.049
So you want me to go public
with a prediction
that won't come true.

33:49.130 --> 33:50.586
Jesus Christ,
please don't tell me

33:50.690 --> 33:52.544
you're worried about
losing your credibility
right now.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.345
Millions of people will die.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.223
More.

33:55.330 --> 33:57.389
What if they don't call it off?

33:57.490 --> 33:59.549
What if everybody knows
and they go through
with it anyway?

33:59.660 --> 34:01.639
What if...
what if nobody cares?

34:01.740 --> 34:04.994
Or what if they're
only able to believe
what they already believe?

34:05.100 --> 34:06.476
What if the truth
no longer matters?

34:06.580 --> 34:08.559
No, but it... it does.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.661
What if it doesn't?

34:12.150 --> 34:13.686
Fuck!

34:13.790 --> 34:15.826
Well, then Caleb's out
of a job, and he might
as well try anyway.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.431
That's the sanest
fucking thing you've said.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.667
I have it
from a reliable source

34:28.770 --> 34:30.385
that an element within the CIA

34:30.490 --> 34:32.526
is planning a biological...

34:33.890 --> 34:35.187
I have it
from a reliable source

34:35.290 --> 34:36.621
that a radical element
within the CIA

34:36.730 --> 34:39.631
is planning to release
a weaponized plague
at the Hajj.

34:39.740 --> 34:41.731
The loss of life
would be in the millions.

34:42.660 --> 34:44.594
Another couple of minutes.

34:44.700 --> 34:46.691
[Caleb] I have it
from a reliable source

34:47.940 --> 34:49.282
that an element within the CIA

34:49.390 --> 34:50.926
is planning a biological...

34:51.030 --> 34:53.021
[Caleb continues speaking
indistinctly]

35:15.770 --> 35:17.761
[car horn blaring]

35:21.740 --> 35:22.718
-Out.
-[man] Don't shoot me.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.811
The car is yours.

35:27.780 --> 35:29.782
[Marty] Okay.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.781
[Sharla] She's 15 minutes
ahead of us.

35:38.830 --> 35:40.832
Why didn't you trust me?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.631
VVhen?

35:45.520 --> 35:47.659
The day you left me.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.762
No. You left me.

35:50.610 --> 35:51.747
-No, I didn't.
-[Joe] No, you did.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.659
You said you didn't care
if we stayed together

35:53.770 --> 35:56.204
so long as I didn't do
whatever it was
my Uncle was asking me to do.

35:57.410 --> 35:59.719
I knew you were gonna do it.

35:59.820 --> 36:01.856
How could you possibly know
if I didn't know?

36:02.860 --> 36:05.158
'Cause you would've told me.

36:05.260 --> 36:07.069
You'd have said, "Hey.
Wanna hear something crazy?

36:07.180 --> 36:09.808
My uncle tried to recruit me
into the CIA

36:09.910 --> 36:11.525
at Thanksgiving dinner."

36:11.630 --> 36:13.803
And we probably would've
laughed at it.

36:13.910 --> 36:17.641
But you kept it a secret.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.889
There's no way I would've
ever been in a relationship
with someone--

36:20.000 --> 36:21.774
[Paul]
Someone leading a double-life?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.871
Paul.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.431
Babe.

36:30.890 --> 36:32.881
I'm gonna get some air.

36:34.770 --> 36:36.761
Okay.

36:53.910 --> 36:56.026
[intense music playing]

37:42.880 --> 37:44.871
[stone clattering]

37:47.040 --> 37:48.291
[gunshot]

37:50.570 --> 37:52.561
I'm sorry.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.121
I should've...
I should've told you.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.437
Why didn't you?

38:08.540 --> 38:11.338
I don't know. Maybe...
maybe for the same reason
that you didn't tell Paul.

38:18.150 --> 38:20.141
No.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.951
Not the same reason.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.991
[faint rattling]

38:33.050 --> 38:35.223
[gunshots]

38:35.330 --> 38:37.787
[Caleb] Fuck! Jared! Jared!

38:37.890 --> 38:39.881
-[gunshots]
-[men shouting]

38:45.100 --> 38:47.091
[Janice screams]

38:56.590 --> 38:58.046
Are you armed?

38:58.150 --> 39:00.141
[panﬁng]

39:01.840 --> 39:02.898
Oh, fuck!

39:03.000 --> 39:04.888
-Oh...
-Are you armed?

39:05.000 --> 39:05.978
I have a gun in the backpack.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.071
Get up.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.699
Upstairs.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.801
Oh...

39:18.130 --> 39:20.121
-Eyes forward.
-Yeah.

39:30.020 --> 39:32.022
Oh, Jesus.

39:34.470 --> 39:36.461
Fuck.

39:36.830 --> 39:38.889
Why didn't you kill me?

39:38.990 --> 39:41.857
The contract on your life
was canceled.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.370
If the contract on my life
was canceled,

39:43.480 --> 39:45.539
why the fuck are you
pointing a gun
at the back of my head?

39:45.640 --> 39:47.335
Because when you point a gun
at someone,

39:47.440 --> 39:49.431
they do
whatever the fuck you say.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.042
Stop.

39:53.450 --> 39:55.441
-[car lock chimes]
-You're driving.

39:56.130 --> 39:57.700
Where are we going?

39:57.810 --> 39:59.801
Get in.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.993
How do I know you're not gonna
take me somewhere else
and kill me there?

40:06.100 --> 40:08.091
You don't.

40:12.470 --> 40:14.461
[car engine starts]

40:22.310 --> 40:24.312
[intense music playing]

40:25.840 --> 40:26.977
[Ibrahim]
One...

40:27.080 --> 40:29.071
0r none.
-[gun safety clicks]

40:33.890 --> 40:36.381
Wait. Wait. Don't do this.

40:36.490 --> 40:37.980
I'm not gonna fight you.

40:38.090 --> 40:39.022
He may leave this place
one day,

40:39.130 --> 40:41.462
but yours is a ransom
that can't ever be paid.

40:41.570 --> 40:44.038
He may see his family again
one day.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.391
[Deacon] Don't listen to him.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.115
But you're an American soldier.

40:47.220 --> 40:48.391
You will never
leave this place.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.229
So the answer is obvious.

40:50.340 --> 40:51.796
Let your friend kill you.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.902
-Don't listen to _him.
-[mumbles indistinctly]

40:54.790 --> 40:56.781
Don't listen to him.

41:00.150 --> 41:02.141
Okay?

41:07.760 --> 41:09.751
[both grunting]

41:11.320 --> 41:13.322
Stop.

41:15.170 --> 41:17.058
Come on,
he's a German photojournalist,

41:17.170 --> 41:19.161
you are an American soldier.

41:19.890 --> 41:21.426
USA.

41:21.530 --> 41:23.236
USA.

41:23.340 --> 41:25.331
Stop.

41:26.940 --> 41:28.032
Stop!

41:28.140 --> 41:30.131
Stop.

41:34.390 --> 41:35.800
-Stop!
-[neck snaps]

41:35.910 --> 41:38.003
Stop!

41:38.110 --> 41:40.101
USA.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.253
[crying]

41:45.360 --> 41:47.874
[Ibrahim] To survive,
life must eat life.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.955
[screams] No!

42:03.820 --> 42:05.811
[Ibrahim grunting]

42:11.940 --> 42:13.942
[speaking foreign language]

42:50.860 --> 42:52.430
[Marty] So where is the car?

42:52.540 --> 42:54.246
[Sharla] It says it's in here.

42:54.350 --> 42:56.523
-[Marty] In here?
-[Sharla] Yeah.

42:56.630 --> 42:57.767
Who the fuck is that?

42:57.870 --> 42:59.861
[Marty] I don't know.
Be careful.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.230
So what happened
to my contract, Gabrielle?

43:53.840 --> 43:55.842
Sharla Shepard
told you my name?

43:57.690 --> 43:59.749
So you were in that trunk
this morning.

43:59.850 --> 44:01.841
She's dead by now.

44:02.530 --> 44:04.509
Wasn't me.

44:04.610 --> 44:06.237
Not that I didn't want the job,

44:06.340 --> 44:08.956
but you have Marty Frost
to thank for that one.

44:09.060 --> 44:11.199
Who's Marty Frost?

44:11.300 --> 44:13.291
She's your inside man.

44:14.060 --> 44:16.062
Why am I alive?

44:17.070 --> 44:19.061
I don't get that specific.

44:19.910 --> 44:21.901
Take the next exit.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.091
So it's that easy, is it?

44:28.200 --> 44:30.452
You don't need to know
why you're killing

44:30.560 --> 44:32.835
or not killing someone?

44:35.280 --> 44:37.282
Nothing.

44:39.130 --> 44:41.667
I don't interest myself in why.

44:41.770 --> 44:43.863
I think more often
in terms of when,

44:43.970 --> 44:45.267
sometimes where,

44:45.370 --> 44:47.372
always how much.

44:50.460 --> 44:52.234
Do you even know
what the fuck is happening?

44:52.340 --> 44:54.535
Do I know that they're
gonna attack the Hajj?

44:56.190 --> 44:58.181
VVhen?

45:00.350 --> 45:02.341
Friendly advice?

45:05.190 --> 45:07.374
They might not
want you dead today,

45:07.480 --> 45:10.233
but sooner or later
you'll become
an embarrassment to them.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.413
It'll happen this way.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.294
Some time will pass.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.742
Months, maybe even years.

45:16.850 --> 45:19.967
Enough time that you
won't stop thinking about it.

45:21.970 --> 45:24.825
But you'll grow
just a little more accustomed
to living with it.

45:24.930 --> 45:26.318
The paranoia.

45:26.420 --> 45:28.035
You won't
look over your shoulder

45:28.140 --> 45:30.756
quite as often as you used to.

45:30.860 --> 45:33.977
You may even learn
to meet a stranger
without fearing them.

45:35.420 --> 45:38.127
Then one day,
you'll be walking,

45:38.230 --> 45:40.801
maybe the first
sunny day of spring,

45:40.910 --> 45:42.901
a car will slow beside you,

45:43.350 --> 45:44.282
door will open,

45:44.390 --> 45:46.039
and someone you know,
maybe even trust will---

45:46.150 --> 45:48.152
[Joe] That's not possible.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.591
Everyone I trust is dead.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.388
[dramatic music playing]

46:02.290 --> 46:04.281
-[crashing]
-[Joe grunts]

46:06.010 --> 46:08.615
[dramatic music continues]
