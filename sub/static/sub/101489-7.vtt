I didn't have a chance.

33:51.610 --> 33:54.613
Elevate, don't denigrate.

33:54.787 --> 33:56.572
That's what I tell 'em--

33:56.746 --> 33:58.704
my kids.

34:00.358 --> 34:02.926
What do you think
the Italians tell their kids?

34:03.100 --> 34:04.667
I... I don't know.

34:04.841 --> 34:07.104
Yeah, yeah, but you...
you see it, though, right?

34:07.278 --> 34:09.237
What they're doing?

34:10.803 --> 34:13.415
Call a man an animal,
keep him in the dirt.

34:14.893 --> 34:16.940
But what if he don't grunt?

34:17.114 --> 34:19.116
What if he don't honk?

34:19.290 --> 34:21.118
What if he walks tall

34:21.292 --> 34:23.251
and stays a man?

34:24.991 --> 34:26.732
Come on.
You-you know what that is.

34:26.906 --> 34:28.603
You boys do it all the time.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.867
No, not me.

34:31.041 --> 34:34.000
You get in the dirt yourself

34:34.175 --> 34:37.351
and you show him
how to be an animal!

34:37.525 --> 34:40.398
You show him how to hate,
you show him how to be cruel.

34:40.572 --> 34:42.531
You kill his friends!

34:44.706 --> 34:46.795
Murder his child.

34:53.976 --> 34:55.804
Boss, I...

34:55.978 --> 34:58.068
I didn't know. I...

35:01.115 --> 35:03.378
They can't rise to our level,

35:03.552 --> 35:06.381
so they got to drag us down
to theirs.

35:07.686 --> 35:09.297
But it's a trap.

35:12.256 --> 35:15.564
It's a trap,

35:15.738 --> 35:18.828
'cause if I get in the dirt
like them...

35:20.873 --> 35:22.919
...that means
they were right the whole time.

35:23.093 --> 35:25.356
[Opal clears throat, sniffles]

35:25.530 --> 35:27.489
See, Opal right here...

35:30.056 --> 35:32.668
...he's kind of
an eye-for-an-eye type brother.

35:34.409 --> 35:36.367
But he's not responsible
for this family.

35:36.541 --> 35:38.500
Kill or be killed.

35:40.023 --> 35:41.764
Win or lose.

35:41.938 --> 35:44.114
It ain't complex.

35:46.551 --> 35:48.423
You know what I think?

35:48.597 --> 35:51.469
Every country has
its own type of criminal.

35:51.643 --> 35:53.819
In America,
we got the confidence man.

35:53.993 --> 35:57.127
Snake oil salesman, grifter.

35:57.301 --> 36:00.261
He don't rob you as much as
trick you into robbing yourself.

36:01.610 --> 36:03.438
See, 'cause in America,

36:03.612 --> 36:05.788
people want to believe.

36:07.137 --> 36:09.139
They got that dream.

36:11.141 --> 36:15.058
And a dreamer, you can fleece.

36:18.279 --> 36:20.106
Boss, I... I'm sorry.

36:20.281 --> 36:22.108
I-I... I don't understand.

36:22.283 --> 36:25.286
[muttering]

36:31.292 --> 36:33.642
He wants me to kill his brother.

36:35.644 --> 36:37.646
Josto.

36:41.606 --> 36:43.565
But I ain't gonna do it.

36:46.524 --> 36:48.483
What are you gonna do?

36:50.267 --> 36:52.313
No.

36:54.140 --> 36:56.012
What are we gonna do?

36:56.186 --> 36:58.319
[Odis exhales softly]

36:59.798 --> 37:01.757
[Gaetano sighs]

37:24.388 --> 37:26.216
[coughing]

37:26.390 --> 37:28.349
[door opens]

37:35.921 --> 37:37.880
[Gaetano groaning]

37:50.936 --> 37:52.895
This thing is done.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.816
Your brother gave me
the stockyards, the trucking.

38:02.557 --> 38:04.559
Equal partners.

38:06.212 --> 38:08.084
If...

38:10.042 --> 38:11.740
...I kill you.

38:18.050 --> 38:20.009
You don't like that?

38:23.099 --> 38:25.928
Family is family.
[groans]

38:26.102 --> 38:28.234
Maybe.

38:28.409 --> 38:30.715
But nobody in my family's
trying to kill me.

38:30.889 --> 38:32.630
Enough talking.

38:32.804 --> 38:35.067
If you're going to kill me,
kill me.

38:35.241 --> 38:37.287
[Gaetano panting]

38:38.419 --> 38:40.421
Nah.

38:42.466 --> 38:44.555
Let him go.

38:44.729 --> 38:46.296
What?

38:46.470 --> 38:49.865
Tell your brother
the stockyards are ours now.

38:51.388 --> 38:53.259
[grunts]

38:53.434 --> 38:55.523
[panting]

38:58.700 --> 39:00.136
OMIE:
See you in the funny papers.

39:02.051 --> 39:03.313
[exhales]

39:03.487 --> 39:04.880
[grunts]

39:12.104 --> 39:13.845
You're on the road.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.934
I want that Calamita dead.
You hear me?

39:16.108 --> 39:18.546
Already done.
He just ain't lying down yet.

39:29.948 --> 39:31.907
Sure hope you know
what you're doing.

42:05.103 --> 42:06.409
MAN:
Now I get it.

42:06.583 --> 42:07.976
[rooster crows]
