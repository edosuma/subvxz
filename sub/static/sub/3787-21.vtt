00:01.569 --> 00:05.471
I'll go check on your salads.

00:05.473 --> 00:08.207
Oleg, what's the hold up
with the salads?

00:08.209 --> 00:11.710
I never made one before.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.413
My two favorite guys,
Big Doug and Sancho,

00:14.415 --> 00:15.848
are ordering salads?

00:15.850 --> 00:17.750
What happened
to their usual BLTs?

00:17.752 --> 00:20.486
Burgers, lasagna,
and tacos?

00:20.488 --> 00:22.388
They said they
want to lose weight.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.722
And no matter
what you order,

00:23.724 --> 00:26.925
it's easier to
throw up here than at home.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.561
I don't get why nobody
wants to be fat anymore.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.831
The fat seasons of<i> Oprah</i>
were always the best.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.869
You're right.

00:36.871 --> 00:40.005
Every other year of<i> Oprah</i>
was the best years.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.344
What is this I hear about you
blushing beauties on a diet?

00:45.346 --> 00:46.745
Oh, we're not blushing.

00:46.747 --> 00:51.583
We're just still
flushed from sitting down.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.052
And we're trying
to get in shape.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.354
Yeah, preferably a shape
that doesn't resemble

00:55.356 --> 00:58.357
a seasonal gourd.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.059
Plus my girlfriend
wants me to slim down

01:00.061 --> 01:03.462
so we can sit on the same side
of the plane when we travel.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.801
Well, Big Doug,

01:08.803 --> 01:12.271
you tell that lucky lady
that I would rather date a man

01:12.273 --> 01:14.073
with boobs bigger than mine

01:14.075 --> 01:17.476
than a man who brings his own
salad dressing to a restaurant.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.515
Pie me.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.417
Cherry, pumpkin,
or coconut cream?

01:25.419 --> 01:29.121
(both)
Yes.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.556

Ooh Ooh ¶

01:48.509 --> 01:50.209
I just talked
to this guy at--

01:50.211 --> 01:53.779
I think it's table three,
I still don't know the numbers.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.681
Anyway, he asked,
"What's new?"

01:55.683 --> 01:57.349
And I told him we were
opening a dessert bar

01:57.351 --> 01:58.750
at the airport tomorrow.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.053
Then I realized he was
asking what kind of pot

02:01.055 --> 02:04.289
I was selling this week.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.159
Why are you telling people
about us and the airport?

02:07.161 --> 02:10.229
It's like when you told everyone
you thought you had HPV.

02:12.366 --> 02:16.502
That was a state-mandated
kind of thing.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.704
Oh, look who it is--

02:18.706 --> 02:20.072
the airport people.

02:20.074 --> 02:23.041
You guys putting together
a little happy hour?

02:23.043 --> 02:24.643
With the jocks at Southwest?

02:24.645 --> 02:28.547
Or the "in crowd"
at the Virgin Terminal?

02:28.549 --> 02:33.585
You know who's going
to be a terminal virgin?

02:33.587 --> 02:35.521
You can make all
the death threats you want,

02:35.523 --> 02:37.122
but you know what
will keep me alive?

02:37.124 --> 02:39.391
The fact that you two
work at the airport.

02:39.393 --> 02:42.928
[laughing]

02:42.930 --> 02:47.533
Hey, everybody!

02:47.535 --> 02:50.869
Here comes the almost bride.

02:50.871 --> 02:54.006
Did you ever see
a prettier almost bride?

02:54.008 --> 02:58.043
I mean, you know,
besides Jennifer Aniston.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.612
Sophie, it's only one week
till the wedding,

03:00.614 --> 03:04.883
so this is your last chance
to take a run at me.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.618
Now you won't be disappointed.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.755
I'm still very sexually active

03:09.757 --> 03:14.593
for the first five minutes.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.295
Oh, Earl.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.030
If I took a run at you,

03:18.032 --> 03:21.233
you'd go right through that wall
like Wile E. Coyote.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.371
Hey, bridesmaid.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.308
(both)
Hey, Sophie.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.742
Hey, Oleg.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.612
You got a message from
your brother in the Ukraine.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.480
Yoshinko called?

03:35.482 --> 03:38.684
Yeah,
hear this message.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.794
What was the message?

03:48.796 --> 03:52.698
"Hey, Oleg,
did you see last night's<i> Alf?"</i>

03:52.700 --> 03:56.001
Nah...
I don't speak Ukrainian.

03:56.003 --> 04:00.772
I mean, what am I,
a plumber in Queens?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.275
No, so I brought
the whole thing in.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.443
Here he is.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.444
Oleg...

04:05.446 --> 04:10.649
[speaking Ukrainian]

04:11.685 --> 04:13.485
Good-bye.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.288
[speaking Ukrainian]

04:16.290 --> 04:18.290
What did he say?

04:18.292 --> 04:19.291
He's not coming.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.626
I understood a little

04:20.628 --> 04:21.994
'cause I had a Russian
au pair growing up.

04:21.996 --> 04:25.063
You know, until she
bleached my good jeans.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.099
Yoshinko can't come
to the wedding.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.301
He's on a no-fly list,
a no-drive list,

04:29.303 --> 04:32.704
and a no-walk list.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.740
He's in jail.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.075
Oh, but he was
gonna be your best man.

04:37.077 --> 04:40.712
I got a ham
engraved for him.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.414
Don't worry, baby,
I'll find someone.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.849
It could be anyone.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.184
He doesn't even have to be
the best or even good.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.053
I'll have to
lower my standards.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.591
Han,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.726
will you be my best man?

04:54.728 --> 04:57.929
You said lower,
not sub-basement.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.436
Well, Oleg,
I'll need to think about it.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.238
Yes.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.739
Great.
So Han,

05:07.741 --> 05:10.108
you're in charge
of the bachelor party tomorrow.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.078
I want a night that will
disgrace all involved.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.280
A night where no one can look
each other in the eye

05:15.282 --> 05:18.483
at brunch the next day.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.751
Wow, Han.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.887
Bachelor party's
a big responsibility.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.756
Do you know any grown-ups
who can buy you beer?

The grand opening of
this pink airport dungeon

05:33.901 --> 05:36.134
is in a few minutes.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.903
That TSA line
took forever.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.604
The woman with
all those nickels?

05:39.606 --> 05:44.343
I haven't seen that much change
on a lady since Chaz Bono.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.444
Don't worry,

05:45.446 --> 05:47.512
I'm making friends
in the TSA.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.716
Judy, big gal,
little beard?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.818
Having lunch with her
at the Wok N' Roll

05:52.820 --> 05:54.753
near Malaysia Airlines.

05:54.755 --> 05:59.558
It's pretty quiet
over there these days.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.226
Hey, ladies.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.961
Opening day,
I'm so excited

06:02.963 --> 06:07.499
my nipples have been shooting
daggers since I woke up.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.368
Seriously, I haven't been
this excited

06:09.370 --> 06:14.639
since my parents sent me
to military school.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.743
God, does everything have
to be fun when you're gay?

06:17.745 --> 06:21.113
If it isn't,
you're not doing it right.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.348
I'm just happy I get
to be out front here.

06:23.350 --> 06:27.386
Finally, I won't be
stuffed in the back.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.688
I mean unless I run
into a Republican senator

06:29.690 --> 06:33.592
in the men's room.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.328
Come on,
let's open up.

06:36.330 --> 06:39.598
But dat key though?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.666
I love this job.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.735
Wait, should someone
make a speech?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.303
A speech?

06:45.305 --> 06:47.372
If you want to hear my thoughts
on opening this place,

06:47.374 --> 06:50.208
I'll just CC you
on my suicide note.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.645
Fine, I'll make a speech.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.581
To all the school janitors who
told me I'd never have

06:56.583 --> 06:59.985
my own giant set of keys,

06:59.987 --> 07:02.921
too big for any pocket,

07:02.923 --> 07:06.792
and that I wasn't
a good kisser?

07:06.794 --> 07:09.995

07:26.880 --> 07:32.350
All right.
Here they come.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.186
Yep.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.954
Any minute.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.322
Just our luck.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.526
The one day
the airport isn't crowded.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.695
Well, I guess I have time
to go check my make-up

07:43.697 --> 07:46.298
in the men's room.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.104
He wants us to come to Oleg's
bachelor party tonight.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.539
I've gotten a call
like this before,

07:54.541 --> 07:56.408
but usually it's through
a service that involves

07:56.410 --> 08:01.580
making some tassels spin
in opposite directions.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.181
No way.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.051
You know I was planning on
going home and crying tonight.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.652
Han is planning a party.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.522
You will cry there for sure.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.891
That's true.
I really can cry anywhere now.

08:12.893 --> 08:16.461
I guess I've got that at least.

08:16.463 --> 08:20.465
I can't believe I work
at the airport, Max.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.869
Hey, would you feel better
if you held my giant keys?

08:27.541 --> 08:31.409
Hello?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.211
Hello.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.680
Welcome, you're
our first customer.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.883
Do I get a prize?

08:37.885 --> 08:39.384
Is it you?

08:42.155 --> 08:45.290
I'm on board now.
I love this job.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.031
Welcome,
everyone.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.433
I'm your M.C.,
Han Lee,

08:55.435 --> 08:57.502
gonna get the crazy party
started here

08:57.504 --> 09:00.505
with some dirty, racy jokes.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.908
This is the deadest place
I've ever been to,

09:02.910 --> 09:07.345
and I once
woke up in Heaven.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.514
Okay, here we go.

09:09.516 --> 09:13.652
What do a Rubik's Cube
and a penis have in common?

09:13.654 --> 09:16.855
The more you play with it,
the harder it gets.

09:19.793 --> 09:24.162
A Rubik's Cube was
a popular '80s toy.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.798
You suck!
Next act.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.467
[laughter]

09:29.469 --> 09:33.939
What do a walrus and a
Tupperware have in common?

09:33.941 --> 09:34.973
Hold on a minute.

09:34.975 --> 09:39.578
Something about
a seal being tight...

09:41.048 --> 09:42.514
[gasps]
Oh!

09:42.516 --> 09:45.250
I just got a text
from Josh, the pilot.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.985
He says,
"What's up, you?"

09:46.987 --> 09:49.154
Isn't that cute?

09:49.156 --> 09:53.625
Cute that he
forgot your name?

09:53.627 --> 09:57.195
It's really been a long time
for you, hasn't it?

09:57.197 --> 10:02.968
I took off my underwear last
week and a coyote howled.

10:02.970 --> 10:03.768
Tough crowd.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.405
I'm talking about you, Max.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.873
Oh come on, Han.
Loosen up.

10:08.875 --> 10:09.941
Have a drink.

10:09.943 --> 10:15.614
A martini, an appletini,
anything teeny.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.182
Nah, just do a vodka shot.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.151
If nothing else, the glass will
look normal-sized in your hand

10:20.153 --> 10:21.286
and I'll have a laugh.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.421
[laughs]

10:23.423 --> 10:26.157
Can't hurt.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.160
But it did.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.729
Thanks for the party, Han.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.832
What time is it starting?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.433
I've never been a best man.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.103
It's a lot of pressure.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.838
Yeah, being a man
would be hard for you.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.841
You've never
been one before.

10:42.843 --> 10:46.111
Let alone the best one.

10:49.850 --> 10:55.720
What's in that,
ground glass?

10:55.722 --> 10:58.723
Ugh, this party is worse than
the communist party.

10:58.725 --> 11:03.261
And they killed
half my family.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.997
Oleg, don't worry,
I'll get this party started.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.600
I'm making a call to some girls
I went to school with.

11:08.602 --> 11:11.703
The Slut Academy on Seventh.

11:11.705 --> 11:15.407
Commonly known as NYU.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.342
I'm more concerned
about my cousin.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.210
He has something I need.

11:19.212 --> 11:23.214
Soap? Deodorant?
The toughest actin' Tinactin?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.750
Oh, there he is!

11:25.752 --> 11:27.552
- [laughs]
- Hey, hey.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.921
Mwah, mwah.

11:29.923 --> 11:33.324
Well, he didn't
bring the deodorant.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.627
Yuri, you made it.

11:35.629 --> 11:37.829
Are you the stripper?

11:37.831 --> 11:41.299
Probably in a few years.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.567
Did you bring the papers?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.502
The papers I need
to get married?

11:44.504 --> 11:46.504
And those little
Ukrainian candies I love?

11:46.506 --> 11:47.872
Bad news.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.308
The guy who made
the fake papers got deported.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.576
They took the papers.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.578
I ate the candy.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.813
What'd I miss?

11:54.815 --> 11:58.216
Besides my chance
to become something?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.385
Are you the stripper?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.787
Nyet.

12:02.789 --> 12:07.592
A compliment and an insult
in just one word.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.294
Oh, no.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.163
Oh no, no,
no, no, no.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.833
Did I mention "no"?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.167
How can you say the word "no"

12:16.169 --> 12:20.105
but not understand it
when women say it?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.539
This is a disaster.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.843
And not the kind
where I can loot.

12:24.845 --> 12:28.213
I needed those fake papers to
renew my fake green card.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.981
Mine expires next month.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.484
Since when do you care
about expiration dates?

12:32.486 --> 12:36.221
You cook with eggs so old
they fight back.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.623
Sophie will never believe
that I'm not marrying her

12:38.625 --> 12:40.258
just for a green card.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.726
She has major trust issues

12:41.728 --> 12:44.829
since one day, her father
went out for pierogies and...

12:44.831 --> 12:48.833
came back without pierogies.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.241
[soulful music playing]

12:56.243 --> 12:58.309
I'm really enjoying
the dance stylings

12:58.311 --> 13:01.946
of Camel and Toe up there.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.449
Everyone is having fun
except Oleg.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.684
I haven't seen him so much as
put the "V" fingers

13:06.686 --> 13:10.188
in front of his mouth at
any of these ladies.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.523
Ooh!

13:11.525 --> 13:16.294
Wouldn't mind some over
the sweater action with her.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.732
Hers or yours?

13:23.236 --> 13:27.038
Max, I just did something
I've never done.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.009
Told a story
about someone else?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.912
No, I sent
the pilot a boob pic.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.346
[gasps]

13:35.348 --> 13:38.483
Girl, you nasty.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.386
I know.
I am nasty!

13:41.388 --> 13:45.323
I just looked into the camera
with my boobs out and hit send.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.891
Ah-ha, that's awesome.

13:46.893 --> 13:49.527
Uh, circling back now,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.830
did you say you looked
into the camera?

13:51.832 --> 13:54.365
You didn't put your face
in it, did you?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.733
Girl!

13:55.735 --> 13:58.770
You stupid.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.839
How else would he
know it was me?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.974
You never put
your face in it.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.611
Didn't I raise you
better than this?

14:06.613 --> 14:11.649
Well, at least you
weren't smiling in it.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.518
All right,
what kind of smile?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.853
A flirty smirk could work.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.689
A come-hither grin
would be great.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.892
More like...

14:24.731 --> 14:29.567
So you were in this...
pose

14:29.569 --> 14:33.271
with your yabbos out?

14:33.273 --> 14:38.610
So you basically did
a nude yogurt ad.

14:38.612 --> 14:42.013
Yeah, but like yogurt you
want to have sex with, right?

14:44.818 --> 14:46.951
Oh, my God.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.853
Sophie will be
here any minute.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.889
When I called,
she was washing her hair.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.859
She was going to put it
back on her head and come.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.728
Just be honest with her.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.396
Sometimes the truth is ugly.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.599
But she knows that.
She's seen you naked.

15:01.601 --> 15:05.069
Well, still no text back so
apparently not as ugly as this.

15:07.707 --> 15:08.873
What's that about?

15:08.875 --> 15:13.311
Are you selling
real estate now?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.988
I mean, this party couldn't
get any sleazier

15:23.990 --> 15:27.859
unless you invited Robin Thicke.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.827
I'm looking up
at skanky whore city,

15:29.829 --> 15:33.131

15:33.133 --> 15:34.132
You do?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.100
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

15:36.102 --> 15:38.670
Aside from
my complicated past

15:38.672 --> 15:42.407
full of men
that have lied to me.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.610
But you and I don't have secrets
from each other, right, Oleg?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.011
Yeah, well, you see--

15:47.013 --> 15:50.882
It is time for
the traditional best man speech.

15:50.884 --> 15:54.519
So listen up, bitches.

Ow, damn it.

16:03.997 --> 16:07.498
I am bleeding.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.767
Repeat,
I am bleeding.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.369
I can't believe this.

There's an app that burps
when you shake your phone,

What's there to say
about these two kids?

16:24.384 --> 16:26.784
Oleg is a bad cook.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.320

get together, magic.

stay in the country.

Oh, no. Uh...

Next act?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.145
Yeah, I hear ya girl.

I mean that last joke
didn't even have a punch line.

16:57.784 --> 17:02.453
Yeah, I mean,
it was sort of sad.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.821
It was no joke.

17:03.823 --> 17:04.856
This is serious.

It's really serious.

for a green card?

marrying me for my bod.

Or for my connections at
The Container Store, or...

you how to read!

No, no, no.

it can't be me.

will you marry me

I'll need to think about it.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.849
Yes.

won't say yes to is health care.

to get me to do

a little hard for Han, too.
