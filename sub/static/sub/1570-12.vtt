00:32.735 --> 00:36.082
Oh Stan, this trip could not
have come at a better time.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.208
Our lives have
been so dull lately.

00:39.328 --> 00:40.546
I'm not gonna lie.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.418
I started stealing again

00:42.538 --> 00:45.818
and I came real close
to cutting myself.

00:45.938 --> 00:48.749
Anyway, I guess
I'm just trying to say,

00:48.869 --> 00:51.310
thanks for the
surprise trip to Hawaii.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.261
And the surprises
don't stop there

00:53.381 --> 00:56.169
because we're <i>actually</i>
going to Sacramento.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.043
Sacramento?!

00:58.163 --> 01:00.451
That's so... boring!

01:00.711 --> 01:03.420
Boring? But honey,
Sacramento is broken up

01:03.455 --> 01:04.622
into four different areas.

01:04.656 --> 01:06.089
Area one.

01:06.123 --> 01:07.090
Area two.

01:07.124 --> 01:08.091
Area three.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.358
Area four.

01:09.393 --> 01:11.027
Doesn't that sound insane?!

01:15.833 --> 01:17.634
So, then I told him,
"I like my men

01:17.668 --> 01:19.235
like I like my coffee:

01:19.269 --> 01:21.170
in an extra-large cup."

01:21.205 --> 01:23.038
Ooh.

01:23.073 --> 01:25.340
Oh, Margie, you gotta stop
pounding so much...

01:26.542 --> 01:27.676
...coffee!

01:27.711 --> 01:28.811
Wink!

01:28.845 --> 01:31.647
Ooh! Look at those girls.

01:31.681 --> 01:33.882
They certainly seem
to be having fun.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.818
I know, they're fabulous.

01:35.852 --> 01:37.019
If we're looking for fun,

01:37.053 --> 01:39.453
maybe we need to take a page
from <i>their</i> book.

01:39.488 --> 01:42.123
Or, maybe it's time for you
to write a book of your own.

01:42.157 --> 01:44.125
Oh, my God.
They're talking to us.

01:44.159 --> 01:45.994
We knew you were
listening to us.

01:46.028 --> 01:47.061
We don't mind.

01:47.096 --> 01:48.029
We like it.

01:48.063 --> 01:49.864
We're four
high-flying gals

01:49.898 --> 01:51.298
who like to have fun.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.601
We give a whole new
meaning to "Red Eye."

01:55.202 --> 01:57.270
I'm not sure I get that,
but I know it's filthy.

01:57.304 --> 02:00.507
You girls should have
your own TV show!

02:00.541 --> 02:02.308
People tell us that
all the time.

02:02.343 --> 02:03.510
But I can assure you,

02:03.544 --> 02:05.211
we're not simple
TV caricatures,

02:05.246 --> 02:07.981
we're real people
with hopes and dreams.

02:08.015 --> 02:10.181
I'm Angie, I'm in it for money.

02:13.186 --> 02:16.588
I'm Christy,
I'm in it for adventure!

02:19.392 --> 02:21.927
I'm Margie, I'm in it for love.

02:25.032 --> 02:27.699
I'm Denise,
I'm in it to avenge my father.

02:38.477 --> 02:40.078
And together, we're...

02:40.112 --> 02:43.681
The Naughty Stewardesses!

02:43.715 --> 02:46.249
Those are some friendly skies.

02:47.552 --> 02:51.855
Oh, my God! Stan, you had
a piece of glass in your eye.

02:55.426 --> 02:58.561
I really appreciate you
doing my homework for me, Steve.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.696
Aw...

02:59.730 --> 03:01.430
I should be thanking you.

03:01.464 --> 03:03.800
I never knew how beautiful
the French language was,

03:03.834 --> 03:05.868
until I had to learn it
to do your homework.

03:05.903 --> 03:07.269
<i>Merci.</i>

03:07.304 --> 03:10.106
Sometimes I feel like I should
be doing my <i>own</i> homework,

03:10.140 --> 03:12.108
but then I'm like, nah.

03:12.142 --> 03:13.642
Did you like my story?

03:15.044 --> 03:18.546
Oh, that's my
boyfriend, Figgus.

03:18.581 --> 03:22.050
He says he wants to "fun me"
in his dad's toolshed.

03:22.085 --> 03:23.251
What does that mean?

03:23.285 --> 03:25.320
Uh... pretty sure
that's his auto-correct.

03:25.354 --> 03:29.357
Oh... that explains why his
"ditch pic" looks like this.

03:30.625 --> 03:32.059
Quit lookin' at my ditch, nerd.

03:32.094 --> 03:34.595
There you are, silly.

03:35.597 --> 03:38.232
Still pining
after Jenna, I see.

03:38.266 --> 03:39.834
If you haven't closed
the deal with her by now

03:39.868 --> 03:41.268
you'll never close it.

03:41.302 --> 03:42.669
Easy, Barry.

03:42.704 --> 03:45.072
He'll make his move
when he's ready.

03:45.107 --> 03:47.440
Yeah. We nerds
have a long history

03:47.474 --> 03:49.743
of making our dream girls
fall for us.

03:49.777 --> 03:51.510
Like that kid in
<i>Revenge of the Nerds,</i>

03:51.545 --> 03:53.412
who finally won the heart
of that cheerleader.

03:53.447 --> 03:55.915
Oh, you mean the one who
put on a Darth Vader mask

03:55.950 --> 03:57.784
so he could rape her
at that carnival?

03:57.818 --> 03:58.752
Yep.

03:58.786 --> 04:00.186
Nah, never saw it.

04:02.055 --> 04:04.757
Yeah, Coach says
I gotta break up with you

04:04.791 --> 04:06.291
so I can focus on football.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.094
Did you do it?
Yes, sir!

04:09.129 --> 04:11.396
Good. 'Cause you players
won't look up to me

04:11.430 --> 04:13.198
if you're having sex
and I'm not.

04:13.233 --> 04:16.969
Now... who's house
am I sleeping at tonight?

04:17.003 --> 04:21.238
Oh, my God. Steve, looks like
Jenna's back on the market.

04:21.273 --> 04:23.741
This is the window
you've been waiting for!

04:23.776 --> 04:25.576
Yeah, it's perfect!

04:25.610 --> 04:28.146
You could ask her to the
"Winter Harvest" dance.

04:38.222 --> 04:39.756
H-h-h-hey-hey, Jenna.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.057
Uh, y-y-you okay?

04:41.092 --> 04:43.626
Figgus broke up with me.

04:43.661 --> 04:45.796
It hurts so bad.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.064
Why can't I ever
find a nice guy?

04:48.099 --> 04:50.166
I wish there was
somebody out there

04:50.200 --> 04:53.502
who'd ask me out
and take this pain away.

05:14.857 --> 05:18.193
Wow! I can't remember
the last time

05:18.227 --> 05:19.727
I had a Black Russian!

05:19.761 --> 05:21.829
I can.
Layover in Moscow.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.863
Ooh.

05:22.897 --> 05:25.199
Sounds like you got,
"laid-over."

05:27.335 --> 05:29.837
Don't try, Stan.
Just you be you.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.739
Oh, my God. Is that
Mark Cuban's bodyguard?

05:32.773 --> 05:35.775
Oh, and Mark Cuban!

05:35.810 --> 05:39.545
Yeah... last night,
he and Margie hooked up...

05:39.579 --> 05:42.748
until they were havin' sex.

05:42.782 --> 05:45.084
Margie, last night was amazing.

05:45.118 --> 05:47.220
I want to finish
what we started.

05:47.254 --> 05:48.855
I'm thinkin' me, you,

05:48.889 --> 05:51.623
and a weekend at
my mansion in Monte Carlo.

05:51.658 --> 05:53.625
Oh, Cuban,
that sounds incredible,

05:53.660 --> 05:54.893
but I'm working
a flight to Miami

05:54.927 --> 05:56.862
which leaves in ten minutes.

05:56.896 --> 05:58.096
Unless...

05:58.130 --> 06:00.165
my new friends
Stan and Francine

06:00.199 --> 06:01.632
could cover for me.

06:01.667 --> 06:02.767
Would you...?

06:02.801 --> 06:04.001
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, my God, yes!

06:04.033 --> 06:07.363
Then I guess that makes you
a couple of Naughty Stewardesses.

06:12.644 --> 06:15.230
I'll see you guys later.
Sounds good.

06:15.350 --> 06:18.854
And Margie, feel free to move
about the Cuban.

06:19.151 --> 06:21.185
The Cuban.

06:21.219 --> 06:21.916
Nice.

06:22.036 --> 06:22.958
Now you got it.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.559
All I needed was the pin!

06:34.403 --> 06:36.641
That's Gin.
You just gave me Gin.

06:36.761 --> 06:38.296
Why would you discard a three?

06:38.418 --> 06:39.619
I don't know.

06:39.653 --> 06:40.954
I guess my head's not in it.

06:40.988 --> 06:42.153
Yeah, clearly.

06:42.188 --> 06:44.756
If I wanted to play a complete
moron, I'd play with Klaus.

06:44.791 --> 06:47.392
Burn, Steve!

06:47.426 --> 06:48.927
Look, what's goin' on, Steve?

06:48.962 --> 06:49.795
Let's fix your head,

06:49.829 --> 06:51.897
so I can actually
have a game here.

06:51.931 --> 06:53.832
Well, you know that
beautiful girl, Jenna,

06:53.866 --> 06:55.400
I've kind of had my eye on?

06:55.434 --> 06:57.202
Is this the same girl
whose picture you put

06:57.236 --> 06:59.036
in your pajama bottoms
before you go to bed?

06:59.071 --> 07:00.071
You know about that?

07:00.105 --> 07:03.207
Who do you think takes
your pajamas off at night?

07:03.274 --> 07:04.508
Anyway..

07:04.542 --> 07:06.043
Jenna's my dream girl...

07:06.078 --> 07:07.144
but it doesn't matter now,

07:07.178 --> 07:09.580
because I missed
my window of opportunity.

07:09.615 --> 07:12.349
I had the perfect opening to
make her mine, but I wussed out!

07:12.383 --> 07:14.618
You wussed out?!

07:14.652 --> 07:16.185
You're better than that, Steve.

07:16.220 --> 07:17.520
Did the Kennedys wuss out?

07:17.554 --> 07:20.090
No! They find a girl they like
and then they drown 'em.

07:20.124 --> 07:21.791
I guess you're right.

07:21.826 --> 07:23.860
Well, look,
I need my Gin partner back

07:23.894 --> 07:25.495
and if you're too chicken
to ask her out,

07:25.496 --> 07:26.429
why don't I do it for you?

07:26.463 --> 07:27.764
What do you mean?

07:27.798 --> 07:29.898
We need to surgically
switch faces,

07:29.933 --> 07:32.434
so I can pretend to be you
and win her heart.

07:32.468 --> 07:34.169
Then we'll switch back
and she's yours.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.438
Wait a minute.
Surgically switch faces?

07:36.472 --> 07:38.774
Why don't you just
put on one of your costumes?

07:38.808 --> 07:41.309
Yeah, I guess I could,
but I also got all these tools

07:41.344 --> 07:42.878
from my planet
in my junk drawer.

07:42.912 --> 07:44.013
Hold on.

07:47.650 --> 07:50.351
Are, are you, are you
sure about this?

07:50.385 --> 07:52.219
Uh, th-th-this
seems really dangerous.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.921
Calm down, it's totally safe.

07:59.628 --> 08:01.862
How are you not dead?!

08:01.896 --> 08:03.797
Is, is my face off?

08:06.400 --> 08:08.802
Now, I just gotta
get mine off so we can swap.

08:16.477 --> 08:20.612
Oh, my God, the inside
of your face smells so bad!

08:21.948 --> 08:23.382
Oh, that's just Greek yogurt.

08:23.416 --> 08:25.484
I spilled some
in my eye socket yesterday

08:25.518 --> 08:26.652
and then I went in the sun.

08:26.687 --> 08:28.120
This is so freaky.

08:28.155 --> 08:29.221
You really think
this is gonna work?

08:29.255 --> 08:30.455
Sure!

08:30.490 --> 08:32.892
With your face on my face,
I'll be dragging Jenna

08:32.926 --> 08:34.225
into the creek behind school

08:34.259 --> 08:36.327
and harvesting
her organs in no time.

08:36.361 --> 08:38.229
No! That's not the plan!

08:38.263 --> 08:39.164
Okay, y-you should probably

08:39.198 --> 08:41.232
write down what you
want me to do.

08:44.278 --> 08:46.504
I hope this was
a good idea, Klaus.

08:46.624 --> 08:49.648
I'm trusting Roger not to screw
things up with my fantasy girl.

08:49.683 --> 08:51.517
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

08:51.551 --> 08:54.052
I'm sure Roger will be
a total gentleman.

08:54.087 --> 08:56.589
Woman, we need to talk.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.757
Oh, hi, Steve.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.492
Did you finish my homework?

08:59.526 --> 09:01.093
Yeah, I did some work at home.

09:01.127 --> 09:03.961
I battered my fish stick
to your candid in the yearbook.

09:03.996 --> 09:05.797
Now get over here
and put this hand

09:05.831 --> 09:07.832
in your back pocket
facing your ass.

09:07.867 --> 09:12.003
Steve! I didn't know
you were so... romantic.

09:15.007 --> 09:16.741
Your bottom's warm.

09:20.645 --> 09:21.978
Great job, guys.

09:22.013 --> 09:23.847
Let me know if you run
out of diet ginger ale.

09:23.882 --> 09:28.419
Thanks, Ange, but no one's
ever run out of diet ginger ale.

09:28.453 --> 09:30.888
This is so exciting.
I know!

09:30.922 --> 09:33.756
I just told someone to turn off
their phone and they did.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.926
Hey, how'd that joker in 3-C
board with a carry-on that big?

09:38.962 --> 09:40.229
Wait a minute.

09:40.263 --> 09:42.632
Isn't that
Mark Cuban's bodyguard?

09:42.666 --> 09:44.166
Why is he on this flight?

09:44.200 --> 09:46.903
Yeah. There's something
fishy about that guy.

09:46.937 --> 09:48.504
I think he may have had
something to do with

09:48.539 --> 09:49.871
my dad's death.

09:49.906 --> 09:52.240
You think that
about everyone, Denise.

09:52.274 --> 09:55.376
You know, he is clutching
that bag awfully close.

09:55.411 --> 09:56.878
I'm on it.

09:59.014 --> 10:00.782
Here, let me
help you stow that.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.017
No! The bag stays with me.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.822
We have to help Stan
get that bag.

10:07.856 --> 10:09.790
We need to create a diversion,

10:09.825 --> 10:11.892
Naughty Stewardess style.

10:15.497 --> 10:17.097
Mini pillow fight!

10:24.271 --> 10:25.772
Can I stow that for you now?

10:25.806 --> 10:27.640
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

10:27.675 --> 10:29.509
No! Ow!

10:34.214 --> 10:37.549
What is it?
It's plans to blow up the sun!

10:40.219 --> 10:43.755
Stan, I think that guy is
touching himself

10:43.790 --> 10:45.290
to the pillow fight.

10:45.324 --> 10:46.959
Oh, who me?

10:46.993 --> 10:50.662
No, I'm just thinking about
the sun blowing up.

10:50.697 --> 10:54.031
It's gonna be so... bright.

10:58.537 --> 10:59.737
Thanks for walking me home.

10:59.771 --> 11:01.939
I would have walked you home
but I didn't want to.

11:01.974 --> 11:03.107
I totally get it.

11:03.141 --> 11:04.609
So, I'll meet you at
the dance tonight?

11:04.643 --> 11:06.043
Yeah, you will.

11:06.077 --> 11:07.211
'Cause this is happening,

11:07.245 --> 11:08.112
you and me.

11:08.146 --> 11:10.514
Dare I say... us...?

11:10.548 --> 11:12.181
Be at the dance at seven sharp.

11:12.216 --> 11:13.383
I'll be there around nine.

11:13.417 --> 11:14.450
What...?

11:14.485 --> 11:15.519
Yes.

11:15.553 --> 11:18.622
Oh, mmm-mmm, oh, my God.

11:18.656 --> 11:20.857
Mmm, oh, this is <i>so</i> heavy.

11:20.892 --> 11:22.759
I'm <i>so</i> into this right now.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.001
So, did you get her?

11:32.035 --> 11:33.836
Oh, hey.
Yeah, yeah, I got her.

11:33.870 --> 11:35.470
She's a special gal, Steve.

11:35.505 --> 11:36.505
Great!

11:36.540 --> 11:38.607
So I guess it's time
to tag me back in?

11:38.642 --> 11:39.942
Yeah, the plan's changed.

11:39.976 --> 11:41.876
What?! Wh-what are you
talking about?

11:41.911 --> 11:43.144
I'm the one that got Jenna.

11:43.178 --> 11:45.112
I should be able
to take her to the dance.

11:45.147 --> 11:46.748
And spend the rest
of my life with her.

11:46.782 --> 11:48.583
Wait a minute,
th-this is my life.

11:48.617 --> 11:49.651
I'm Steve!

11:49.685 --> 11:51.419
Yeah, yeah you
make a good point.

11:51.453 --> 11:54.255
Okay, we'll switch faces
just as soon as I fix this lamp.

11:54.289 --> 11:56.057
What's wrong with it?
It's broken.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.993
Ah... shouldn't have
hit him in the face.

12:00.028 --> 12:03.363
That's my face.

12:05.967 --> 12:08.334
I'm so happy
we're together now.

12:08.369 --> 12:12.372
I had no idea that there was
such a cool guy under that face.

12:12.406 --> 12:14.640
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

12:14.642 --> 12:16.909
I want to be with you
forever, Jenna.

12:16.944 --> 12:20.046
Me, too. But I have something
I need to tell you.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.348
Steve, I'm pregnant
with Figgus's baby.

12:23.383 --> 12:25.551
Huh?
When I told him about it,

12:25.586 --> 12:28.588
he just said he was late
for football practice.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.289
He doesn't care at all
and that really hurts.

12:31.323 --> 12:34.960
But now that I know you
want to be with me forever,

12:34.994 --> 12:37.528
everything's gonna
be all right.

12:37.563 --> 12:39.430
Right?
Of course.

12:39.465 --> 12:40.699
Oh, my God, of course.

12:40.733 --> 12:42.567
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

12:48.573 --> 12:49.707
You wanted your life back.

12:49.741 --> 12:51.408
Well, here you go.

12:51.442 --> 12:53.844
Oh, and I got big news
on the Jenna front.

12:53.878 --> 12:55.412
Oh, thank God.

12:55.446 --> 12:58.015
It feels so good not to have
your disgusting skin touching

12:58.049 --> 12:59.650
my face muscles anymore.

12:59.684 --> 13:00.818
What's the big news?

13:00.852 --> 13:03.319
Your hatred of my skin
is news to me.

13:03.353 --> 13:05.187
No...! About Jenna,
you idiot.

13:05.222 --> 13:06.188
What did I miss?

13:06.223 --> 13:07.490
Wh-what do I need to know?

13:08.959 --> 13:10.927
Nothing.
She's totally into you

13:10.961 --> 13:12.561
and you should
hurry back to the dance,

13:12.596 --> 13:13.596
she's waiting for you.

13:13.631 --> 13:15.464
That's amazing, Roger!

13:15.499 --> 13:16.799
Thanks a lot.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.467
Wait, uh, there, there
might be one more thing.

13:19.502 --> 13:21.236
Oh, yeah, there is--
I owe you this.

13:22.705 --> 13:23.939
That was the thing.

13:23.973 --> 13:25.107
Run to her.

13:31.426 --> 13:32.826
I'm so nervous.

13:32.860 --> 13:34.428
I can't believe
you're not nervous.

13:34.462 --> 13:36.930
Nervous?! I'm excited
to meet your parents.

13:36.964 --> 13:38.698
I've never met
the parents before.

13:38.733 --> 13:40.300
I'm so glad I have you.

13:40.335 --> 13:42.969
When I told you it was time
to come clean to my parents

13:43.004 --> 13:45.938
about my baby,
you didn't even hesitate.

13:45.972 --> 13:49.542
Hey, if my baby wants to tell
the world about her baby,

13:49.576 --> 13:50.610
who am I to say no?

13:50.644 --> 13:53.346
You're so sweet.

13:53.380 --> 13:57.383
I don't even know what to tell
my parents about Figgus...

13:57.417 --> 13:58.817
Don't even mention him.

13:58.852 --> 14:00.385
Steve's here now.

14:00.419 --> 14:01.153
I'm taking over.

14:07.026 --> 14:09.894
Mom, Dad, Steve's here!

14:10.996 --> 14:11.963
Oh, great!

14:11.997 --> 14:13.865
Welcome to our home, son.

14:20.572 --> 14:23.374
We've heard such nice
things about you.

14:23.408 --> 14:24.808
The pleasure is all mine.

14:24.842 --> 14:27.311
Halfway there.
Still excited.

14:28.547 --> 14:29.647
Oh, my God!

14:29.681 --> 14:30.981
Darling, are you all right?

14:31.015 --> 14:34.016
I-I'm fine. It's just
a little morning sickness.

14:34.051 --> 14:37.320
I didn't want it
to come out like this.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.589
But...
we're pregnant!

14:39.623 --> 14:41.391
What?!
What?!

14:41.425 --> 14:42.492
What?!

14:42.526 --> 14:43.493
Steve!

14:43.527 --> 14:45.595
Don't play innocent now!

14:45.629 --> 14:47.729
You knocked up my baby girl?

14:47.763 --> 14:49.565
When I get down there,
I'm gonna murder you.

14:49.599 --> 14:50.832
Don't you move.

14:53.069 --> 14:54.570
You're pregnant?

14:54.604 --> 14:56.337
Oh, my God. He's got me!

14:56.371 --> 14:57.771
He's taking me up the stairs!

14:57.806 --> 14:59.607
What's at the top
of the stairs?!

14:59.641 --> 15:03.110
Oh, God, it's all
happening so slowly!

15:05.714 --> 15:07.348
All right,
according to the notes

15:07.382 --> 15:08.916
scribbled on those blueprints,

15:08.950 --> 15:12.419
tonight's the night that Mark
Cuban plans to blow up the sun.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.820
That's brilliant!

15:15.923 --> 15:19.892
Anyway, we gotta
find Cuban and stop him.

15:24.699 --> 15:26.466
Look, there's Margie.

15:28.935 --> 15:31.303
Margie, thank God
you're all right.

15:31.338 --> 15:34.072
We found out that Mark Cuban
is trying to blow up the sun.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.207
We need to stop him.

15:35.242 --> 15:36.442
Do you know where he is?

15:36.476 --> 15:38.377
Yeah, he's in his study.

15:38.411 --> 15:41.513
You touch-a my son,
I break-a you face.

15:42.949 --> 15:44.382
The flight attendant from our flight--
Some guy!

15:44.416 --> 15:48.753
We saw your bodyguard's copy of
your plans to blow up the sun

15:48.787 --> 15:50.388
and we're here to stop you.

15:50.422 --> 15:51.623
What?!

15:55.594 --> 15:56.994
I see your confusion.

15:57.028 --> 15:59.996
I left off an "s."
It's the "Suns."

16:00.030 --> 16:01.831
The Phoenix Suns.
They're in our conference,

16:01.866 --> 16:03.700
and even though they haven't
been to the playoffs

16:03.735 --> 16:05.135
in like the last seven years,

16:05.169 --> 16:06.770
I think this
could be their year.

16:06.804 --> 16:09.706
Well, having missiles
pointed at an entire NBA team

16:09.741 --> 16:11.040
is still pretty terrible.

16:11.075 --> 16:12.509
You know, I debated
whether I should say

16:12.543 --> 16:14.010
"blow up" in these plans?

16:14.044 --> 16:16.379
What I meant was, I'm going to
destabilize their franchise

16:16.413 --> 16:18.614
through swift and shrewd
free agency moves.

16:18.649 --> 16:21.183
But "blow up" sounds
way more exciting.

16:21.217 --> 16:23.085
Oh! But we do have an intern

16:23.119 --> 16:25.854
who's going to deflate their
basketballs before practice.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.959
Oh. I guess that's
not a problem then.

16:31.994 --> 16:35.096
Because it sounds
perfectly legal.

16:35.130 --> 16:37.799
We don't care if it is legal!

16:37.833 --> 16:40.702
We're the official airline
of the Phoenix Suns!

16:40.736 --> 16:42.370
So, when you mess with them,

16:42.405 --> 16:45.072
you mess with
the Naughty Stewardesses.

17:01.656 --> 17:03.323
Well, looks like we've beaten

17:03.357 --> 17:05.191
and hog-tied you
in your own home,

17:05.224 --> 17:09.862
so... our estimated time
of departure is... right now.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.566
Oh, Stan, that was amazing!

17:13.599 --> 17:15.034
This was the most exciting trip

17:15.068 --> 17:16.135
we could have taken.

17:16.169 --> 17:19.171
Says the girl who hasn't
been to Sacramento yet.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.640
Oh, Stan, I love you.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.442
I love you too, honey.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.944
And I love you, Denise.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.878
Um, what?!

17:27.913 --> 17:31.049
Dad?! You're alive!

17:31.083 --> 17:34.386
He just punched her in the face,
like, three seconds ago.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.189
Wait a minute, where's Steve?

17:39.224 --> 17:41.659
Um... he went to meet
his girlfriend's parents.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.227
But we play Gin on Thursdays.

17:43.261 --> 17:44.395
You could play with me.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.468
Klaus, I gotta take this.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.802
It's private, so...

17:55.906 --> 17:58.708
Stevie, Gin night,
what's the excusies?

17:58.743 --> 17:59.909
You like that?

17:59.943 --> 18:01.343
Yeah, it sounds like
cute shorthand,

18:01.345 --> 18:02.746
but it's actually longer.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.581
So, that's what
I've been working on.

18:04.615 --> 18:07.149
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:07.184 --> 18:09.385
Yes, yes, I knew
she was pregnant.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.887
Why do you think
you got her back?

18:11.921 --> 18:13.288
You are apoplectic.

18:13.322 --> 18:14.723
You know what you need?
To relax.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.692
I'll tell you what,
meet me at the tea house

18:16.726 --> 18:18.026
we went to that one time.

18:18.060 --> 18:19.895
You know, the one with
those really great mugs

18:19.929 --> 18:21.229
that don't have handles?

18:21.264 --> 18:23.231
So...

18:23.266 --> 18:24.298
How are you?

18:24.332 --> 18:25.867
How's Jenna?

18:25.901 --> 18:28.035
How's Jenna?!
Are you kidding!

18:28.069 --> 18:29.003
Hey! Hey!

18:29.037 --> 18:31.439
You need to take a nice
calming sip of tea

18:31.473 --> 18:32.807
and abide by the rules.

18:34.777 --> 18:36.110
She's pregnant!

18:36.144 --> 18:37.144
Her parents won't help.

18:37.178 --> 18:38.078
And she's all alone.

18:38.113 --> 18:39.513
I-I don't know what to do.

18:39.547 --> 18:41.981
Well, I think it's pretty
obvious what you need to do.

18:42.016 --> 18:44.317
You need to kick this bitch...

18:44.351 --> 18:45.619
...to the curb.

18:45.653 --> 18:47.086
Pronto.

18:47.121 --> 18:50.256
I can't abandon her.
I gotta do the right thing.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.526
Steve, that's not
your responsibility.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.027
If it's anybody's,
it's Figgus's.

18:54.061 --> 18:56.762
That's the thing,
Figgus doesn't care.

18:56.797 --> 18:59.097
All he cares is what
his football coach says.

18:59.132 --> 19:00.332
Well, there you go!

19:00.366 --> 19:01.434
Let's go fix this.

19:01.468 --> 19:02.868
Get my Gin partner back.

19:02.903 --> 19:04.703
But Roger,
what are we gonna do?

19:04.738 --> 19:06.171
Steve, I think
it's pretty obvious,

19:06.205 --> 19:09.442
that this is one of those
things I explain on the way.

19:12.711 --> 19:13.978
Uh, Coach?

19:14.012 --> 19:16.113
M-my mom says if you
want to stay over again,

19:16.148 --> 19:18.416
y-you have to at least
roll up your sleeping bag.

19:18.451 --> 19:19.717
Get in here!

19:20.820 --> 19:22.153
What's up, Coach?

19:22.187 --> 19:24.823
Figgus, remember how I said
I didn't want my players

19:24.857 --> 19:26.791
having sex if I
wasn't getting any?

19:26.826 --> 19:28.024
Well, forget that.

19:28.059 --> 19:29.726
Get back together
with your girlfriend.

19:29.761 --> 19:31.394
Okay, Coach!

19:31.429 --> 19:33.063
Does that mean you're
finally getting some?

19:33.097 --> 19:35.966
No... it's more that the school
board heard about my policy

19:36.000 --> 19:38.068
and apparently,
I'm not allowed to have it.

19:38.102 --> 19:41.438
Sometimes in life, you gotta
make half-time adjustments.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.539
So, get back together
with your girlfriend,

19:43.574 --> 19:45.741
raise your baby together and...

19:45.776 --> 19:46.943
well, see you at practice.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.711
And I hope you don't
drop that baby

19:48.745 --> 19:50.346
as much as you drop
the football.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.315
Now get out of here.

19:53.350 --> 19:54.717
Your towel's bleeding, Coach.

19:54.751 --> 19:56.251
Shut up and
hit the showers, Figgus.

19:56.286 --> 19:59.821
Oh, and don't look behind
the door on your way out.

19:59.856 --> 20:02.090
Okay, Coach, you can
have your face back

20:02.124 --> 20:03.625
if you promise us two things:

20:03.659 --> 20:05.894
One, never say
anything about this.

20:05.928 --> 20:08.930
And two, run 22
flea-flicker plays

20:08.965 --> 20:10.499
in a row Friday night.

20:13.970 --> 20:18.672
Steve, I really appreciate
you being there for me.

20:18.707 --> 20:21.709
But Figgus... came back.

20:21.743 --> 20:23.276
And he's...

20:23.311 --> 20:26.013
better than you in every way.

20:26.047 --> 20:27.515
Yeah, I agree.

20:29.751 --> 20:32.685
Come on... flea-flicker!

20:32.720 --> 20:35.889
And that's the
twenty-second flea-flicker in a row.

20:35.923 --> 20:37.624
Pearl Bailey is getting smoked!

20:37.658 --> 20:39.091
Terrible coaching.

20:39.126 --> 20:41.360
I got to hand it to you, Roger.

20:41.395 --> 20:43.530
Craziest prop bet I ever took.

20:43.564 --> 20:44.664
That's right, Sammy.

20:44.698 --> 20:47.433
Now give me my pack
of Life Savers.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.368
You're not gonna be
this lucky forever, Roger.
