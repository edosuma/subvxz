00:02.850 --> 00:04.225
Previously, on Future Man...

00:04.226 --> 00:05.893
Did you guys ever
think that I'd be doing

00:05.894 --> 00:07.228
something more with my life?

00:07.229 --> 00:08.771
What about your video game?

00:08.772 --> 00:11.024
It's not real.

00:11.025 --> 00:12.984
Congratulations, you have defeated

00:12.985 --> 00:14.110
all of the Biotics.

00:14.111 --> 00:16.029
Wooo!

00:16.030 --> 00:17.447
The fuck... who are you people?

00:17.448 --> 00:19.449
Everything that happens
in the Biotic Wars is real.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.533
The game is a recruitment

00:20.534 --> 00:21.951
and training tool sent back in time.

00:21.952 --> 00:23.411
You're going to help us save the world.

00:23.412 --> 00:25.205
Time travel 101, you need to blend in.

00:26.957 --> 00:28.249
You're telling me that a cure for herpes

00:28.250 --> 00:29.625
is what brings down all of mankind?

00:29.626 --> 00:31.294
The night of the moon landing,

00:31.295 --> 00:33.212
there was a big party
at Pi Pi Gamma House.

00:33.213 --> 00:34.464
Holy shit.

00:34.465 --> 00:35.590
If we can stop Dr. Kronish

00:35.591 --> 00:36.674
from ever getting herpes,

00:36.675 --> 00:37.884
he'll never become a scientist,

00:37.885 --> 00:39.010
and we can stop this whole cycle

00:39.011 --> 00:40.136
before it even begins!

00:40.137 --> 00:41.637
All right, Santiago, you ready for this?

00:41.638 --> 00:43.639
Let's do this, Skarsgaard.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.725
Is that a subatomic sensor mine?

00:48.812 --> 00:50.646
Welcome to the Resistance.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.077
I'm here at the corner
of Fairfax and Rosewood

01:04.078 --> 01:05.161
where the smell of brisket

01:05.162 --> 01:07.121
usually fills the night air,

01:07.122 --> 01:08.998
but tonight, it's the smell of tragedy

01:08.999 --> 01:11.667
as one of L. A.'s finest
lies dead in the street.

01:17.508 --> 01:19.717
Vincent, I didn't know you were coming!

01:19.718 --> 01:20.927
I'll set an extra place.

01:20.928 --> 01:22.720
Is Jorge running late?

01:22.721 --> 01:24.889
Yeah, uh...

01:24.890 --> 01:26.224
Maria, maybe you should sit down.

01:26.225 --> 01:29.103
Gladly, I've been on my feet all day.

01:32.523 --> 01:33.731
Jorgito kicked.

01:33.732 --> 01:36.651
Do you want to feel?

01:36.652 --> 01:40.071
He's strong like his Papa.

01:40.072 --> 01:42.198
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Santiago.

01:42.199 --> 01:43.366
I didn't know you were here.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.409
They came from Mexico
for the baby shower!

01:45.410 --> 01:46.702
Of course they did.

01:46.703 --> 01:49.580
They should hear this, too.

01:49.581 --> 01:51.749
- I have some news.
- You have news?

01:51.750 --> 01:53.626
Is it the promotion
Jorge was trying to get?

01:53.627 --> 01:54.627
His sisters y <i>la familia</i>

01:54.628 --> 01:55.711
will want to hear about this.

01:55.712 --> 01:57.338
Esmeralda, Gloria, Lupe!

01:59.842 --> 02:02.093
<i>¡Mucho gusto, Señor Skarsgaard!</i>

02:02.094 --> 02:03.427
What is the exciting news?

02:03.428 --> 02:04.887
Well, I never said "exciting."

02:04.888 --> 02:06.556
Did somebody say "exciting"?

02:06.557 --> 02:08.765
This is Jorge's brother, Miguel!

02:08.767 --> 02:09.934
You really look just like him.

02:09.935 --> 02:11.561
Yeah, well, last I checked,

02:11.562 --> 02:12.895
we are currently twins!

02:15.232 --> 02:16.399
So what's the good news?

02:16.400 --> 02:19.527
Say it loud so the baby can hear.

02:19.528 --> 02:21.736
Right, um...

02:25.927 --> 02:30.055

02:37.423 --> 02:39.463
All right, time out! Stop the bike.

03:00.569 --> 03:02.278
Okay, what happened back there

03:02.279 --> 03:03.613
was not okay!

03:03.614 --> 03:04.614
For all we know, you just killed

03:04.615 --> 03:06.449
- a fucking cop!
- Hey!

03:06.450 --> 03:07.658
We killed that cop.

03:07.659 --> 03:08.784
Yeah, we're a team now.

03:08.785 --> 03:10.203
No, I didn't kill a cop,

03:10.204 --> 03:11.287
you killed a fucking cop,

03:11.288 --> 03:12.788
and we're not doing it again!

03:12.789 --> 03:13.873
You just said "we."

03:13.874 --> 03:15.041
Look, it doesn't matter, okay?

03:15.042 --> 03:16.792
Just no more killing!

03:16.793 --> 03:18.878
Well, we're killing Kronish.

03:18.879 --> 03:21.047
No, we're not killing Kronish!

03:21.048 --> 03:22.131
That's not the mission!

03:22.132 --> 03:23.883
The mission is to stop
him from getting herpes,

03:23.884 --> 03:25.468
prevent him from becoming a scientist,

03:25.469 --> 03:26.969
and then he never creates the cure!

03:26.970 --> 03:28.471
Dead men don't get herpes.

03:28.472 --> 03:31.058
Okay, so then what's your plan?

03:37.814 --> 03:39.565
We cockblock him.

03:39.566 --> 03:40.733
Okay, rip his cock off,

03:40.734 --> 03:42.568
he bleeds out slow, I like that.

03:42.569 --> 03:46.739
No, his cock remains fully intact.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.449
We stop him from ever
getting with the girl

03:48.450 --> 03:49.825
that gave him herpes.

03:49.826 --> 03:51.827
Have you ever executed this
mission objective before?

03:51.828 --> 03:53.496
This... this cockblock?

03:53.497 --> 03:55.831
Oh, yes, many times.

03:55.832 --> 03:56.832
Mostly at middle school dances

03:56.833 --> 03:58.000
and at the time I was doing it,

03:58.001 --> 03:59.710
I didn't know it exactly, but yeah.

03:59.711 --> 04:00.836
It's my specialty.

04:00.837 --> 04:02.713
That's fucking stupid!

04:02.714 --> 04:04.173
If we're actually ripping his cock off,

04:04.174 --> 04:05.466
that's one thing, but otherwise,

04:05.467 --> 04:07.343
this just feels like
a big fucking tease!

04:07.344 --> 04:10.554
Wolf, he's the Savior.

04:10.555 --> 04:13.683
We need to trust him.

04:13.684 --> 04:17.185
Oh, fuck! Savior my ass! God damn it!

04:17.187 --> 04:19.189
Try to save this!

04:28.532 --> 04:29.865
Hey!

04:29.866 --> 04:31.617
What the fuck you doing, man?

04:31.618 --> 04:34.870
Tiger, thanks... thanks
for having my back.

04:34.871 --> 04:36.831
I don't know why he hates me so much.

04:36.832 --> 04:39.375
You're physically weak
and nothing like we expected,

04:39.376 --> 04:41.002
but you do have the
knowledge we're lacking,

04:41.003 --> 04:43.045
and you've gotten us this far.

04:43.046 --> 04:44.589
You're not the Future
Man I thought you'd be,

04:44.590 --> 04:47.593
but you are Future Man.

04:51.763 --> 04:54.223
What the fuck is that?

04:54.224 --> 04:57.560
Why is that woman holding
that tiny shrunken man?

04:57.561 --> 04:59.228
You mean, "Why is that mother

04:59.229 --> 05:01.356
carrying her adorable baby"?

05:02.899 --> 05:04.942
That's a baby?

05:04.943 --> 05:07.236
You've never seen a baby before?

05:07.237 --> 05:10.656
Wolf and I are the youngest
members of the Resistance.

05:10.657 --> 05:12.533
We were sterilized with
a nano mist to ensure

05:12.534 --> 05:15.286
that we were the last
generation of humanity.

05:15.287 --> 05:18.372
Whoa, so it's a full on
<i>Children of Men</i> situation.

05:18.373 --> 05:19.540
Why does it look like that?

05:19.541 --> 05:21.417
How does it defend itself?

05:21.418 --> 05:24.171
It can't, it's completely helpless.

05:25.297 --> 05:26.422
I want to touch it.

05:26.423 --> 05:29.008
You, woman, give me that baby!

05:29.009 --> 05:31.302
Tiger, no, no, no, no, Tiger, Tiger.

05:31.303 --> 05:33.179
Give me the chubby man!

05:33.180 --> 05:36.891
Wait, those your bikes?

05:36.892 --> 05:38.017
Yes.

05:38.018 --> 05:39.185
Sorry, brother, I didn't realize

05:39.186 --> 05:41.145
you were Double Ds!

05:41.146 --> 05:44.774
Double Damned!

05:44.775 --> 05:47.943
Jesus, man, what's got you so steamed?

05:47.944 --> 05:49.362
My commander just belittled me

05:49.363 --> 05:52.281
in front of an inferior.

05:52.282 --> 05:53.908
Been there.

05:53.909 --> 05:56.243
My old lady's a real cunt, too.

05:56.244 --> 05:58.454
Where you headed?

05:58.455 --> 06:01.040
California Technical Institute

06:01.041 --> 06:03.793
to cockblock the destroyer of worlds.

06:03.794 --> 06:06.295
Sounds pretty heavy.

06:06.296 --> 06:07.505
Eh, don't worry about this shit,

06:07.506 --> 06:08.798
I'll clean it up.

06:08.799 --> 06:12.009
Ride on, ride strong, brother.

06:18.642 --> 06:23.229
I said, ride on, ride strong.

06:26.358 --> 06:27.566
Give me that thing!

06:27.567 --> 06:29.235
- I want to touch it!
- Tiger, you can't...

06:29.236 --> 06:30.277
you can't just touch her baby!

06:30.278 --> 06:31.529
Why... I'm stronger than her.

06:31.530 --> 06:33.030
I'm sorry, she's completely harmless.
It's fine.

06:33.031 --> 06:34.490
No, I'm not, I'm not!

06:34.491 --> 06:36.158
I've killed hundreds!

06:36.159 --> 06:37.743
Give me that thing.

06:42.499 --> 06:45.000
There's your secret fucking handshake!

06:46.811 --> 06:48.504
Wolf.

06:48.505 --> 06:49.839
What?

06:49.840 --> 06:51.715
I didn't kill him.

06:56.388 --> 06:57.888
Yes.

06:57.889 --> 06:59.932
Get me the police.

07:03.116 --> 07:04.145
Yeah, what?

07:04.146 --> 07:05.938
It's Rick.

07:05.939 --> 07:07.440
Some motherfucker just rolled in here

07:07.441 --> 07:09.191
on stolen Double D bikes.

07:09.192 --> 07:10.359
Yeah, that's the guys who jumped us.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.444
Where did they go?

07:11.445 --> 07:13.529
Caltech.

07:13.530 --> 07:15.906
Kill them all, man.

07:15.907 --> 07:18.493
Avenge my fingers!

07:35.469 --> 07:37.219
All right, I'm going to assume

07:37.220 --> 07:38.220
that you guys have never been

07:38.221 --> 07:39.805
to a frat party before.

07:39.806 --> 07:41.599
I haven't either, so that's okay.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.517
However, I have seen <i>Animal House,</i>

07:43.518 --> 07:47.021
which basically makes me an expert.

07:47.022 --> 07:49.148
The most important thing
is once you're inside,

07:49.149 --> 07:50.316
you blend in.

07:50.317 --> 07:52.401
Just follow my lead, okay?

07:52.402 --> 07:54.403
All right, we got this.

07:56.406 --> 07:59.033
♪ Light the candles on the cake ♪

07:59.034 --> 08:00.868
♪ We're going to celebrate ♪

08:00.869 --> 08:05.080
Okay, maybe we don't got this.

08:05.081 --> 08:07.124
You guys must be looking
for Delta Phi Tau.

08:07.125 --> 08:08.459
- That's across the street.
- Um...

08:08.460 --> 08:11.420
Actually, we were kind of hoping

08:11.421 --> 08:14.256
that maybe tonight, we could celebrate

08:14.257 --> 08:15.549
this great achievement of mankind

08:15.550 --> 08:17.885
here with you guys at Phi Phi Gamma!

08:17.886 --> 08:19.512
You know, it must be
nice to have the freedom

08:19.513 --> 08:21.639
to just walk into
whatever house you want,

08:21.640 --> 08:23.682
to call the cops and
actually have them show up

08:23.683 --> 08:25.226
after you've been repeatedly harassed

08:25.227 --> 08:27.478
and threatened by your fellow students.

08:27.479 --> 08:29.230
Even at Caltech?

08:29.231 --> 08:30.439
Just because these people are nerds

08:30.440 --> 08:32.024
doesn't mean they're not racist!

08:32.025 --> 08:33.734
We know things will get better,

08:33.735 --> 08:35.110
but until that day comes,

08:35.111 --> 08:36.195
we're just going to have to serve

08:36.196 --> 08:37.738
and protect ourselves.

08:37.739 --> 08:39.448
Understand, Colonel Sanders?

08:42.369 --> 08:43.619
I guess I am kind of dressed like him.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.912
Are you blocking his cock right now?

08:44.913 --> 08:47.122
Because it seems like
he's blocking yours.

08:47.123 --> 08:49.250
Brother Tyler, everything okay?

08:49.251 --> 08:51.752
That's what I'm trying to
figure out, Brother Kronish.

09:01.471 --> 09:03.055
Kronish.

09:03.056 --> 09:04.640
- Take it easy, soldier.
- I can't.

09:04.641 --> 09:05.724
He's the father of the mutant race

09:05.725 --> 09:07.059
that destroys mankind.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.143
He's right in front of me.

09:08.144 --> 09:09.895
You guys look like nice folks,

09:09.896 --> 09:12.147
but this is an invite-only party.

09:12.148 --> 09:13.691
If you want to stay for a beer,

09:13.692 --> 09:15.484
stay for a beer, but then...

09:15.485 --> 09:19.114
You and your mutant
race deserves to die!

09:22.576 --> 09:25.327
Oh, my God!

09:25.328 --> 09:27.746
Great job, Wolf, you
just blew our cover.

09:27.747 --> 09:29.164
You know, it's going to
be really hard to blend in

09:29.165 --> 09:31.333
now that they think we're
all white supremacists.

09:31.334 --> 09:33.127
Why would skin color matter?

09:33.128 --> 09:35.212
That's nice, there's
no racism in the future?

09:35.213 --> 09:37.840
I've got it, let's just
camouflage our faces

09:37.841 --> 09:39.008
to look like them.

09:39.009 --> 09:41.594
Nice, Operation Black Face.

09:41.595 --> 09:42.887
This mud will work on our faces.

09:42.888 --> 09:46.056
No, no, no, no, no Operation Black Face.

09:46.057 --> 09:48.642
- Says who?
- Says literally all of society.

09:48.643 --> 09:49.852
Look, I don't have time
to explain to you

09:49.853 --> 09:51.270
two centuries of race relations.

09:51.271 --> 09:52.521
Clearly you guys don't understand

09:52.522 --> 09:55.232
the complexity and
sensitivity of this time.

09:55.233 --> 09:56.609
I do, all right?

09:56.610 --> 09:58.068
You can't go around
breaking people's fingers,

09:58.069 --> 10:00.112
you can't go around trying
to steal people's babies,

10:00.113 --> 10:02.948
and you can't tell people
they're from a mutant race!

10:02.949 --> 10:04.533
Not only is it morally reprehensible,

10:04.534 --> 10:06.744
it's also jeopardizing
this whole mission!

10:06.745 --> 10:08.454
We need another plan.

10:14.836 --> 10:18.005
Houston, we have a solution.

10:21.171 --> 10:22.676
Right. Of course, you don't get that.

10:22.677 --> 10:25.220
Okay, this is now a solo mission

10:25.221 --> 10:26.764
to the moon landing party.

10:26.765 --> 10:27.973
I'm gonna go inside,

10:27.974 --> 10:32.061
infiltrate, and assume Lamar's identity.

10:32.062 --> 10:33.437
Okay, what do we do?

10:33.438 --> 10:36.482
Cockblocking, as you
may or may not know,

10:36.483 --> 10:38.901
is a very delicate
and intricate maneuver.

10:38.902 --> 10:41.737
It requires absolute
concentration at all times.

10:41.738 --> 10:44.740
Once inside, I can have
zero interference, okay?

10:44.741 --> 10:46.575
You guys just stay out here.

10:46.576 --> 10:47.618
So you're saying we should

10:47.619 --> 10:48.827
secure the perimeter.

10:48.828 --> 10:51.080
Yes, yes, secure the perimeter.

10:51.081 --> 10:53.332
And whatever you do,
just don't come inside.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.750
Okay, we'll build a barricade

10:54.751 --> 10:56.543
and secure the perimeter.

10:56.544 --> 10:58.545
We won't fail you, Future Man.

11:02.092 --> 11:04.677
All right, Dr. Kronish, where are you?

11:07.013 --> 11:08.597
Where is he?

11:08.598 --> 11:10.307
I'm at a party.

11:10.308 --> 11:11.850
This is normal.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.401
Barbarella, herpes girl!

11:21.111 --> 11:23.154
Pledge Lamar, where have you been?

11:24.781 --> 11:26.615
The fuck, man, you forget how to talk?

11:26.616 --> 11:27.783
What you talking about, man?

11:27.784 --> 11:28.826
I was outside!

11:28.827 --> 11:30.327
What's wrong with your voice?

11:30.328 --> 11:31.495
It's the helmet.

11:31.496 --> 11:32.579
What do I normally sound like?

11:32.580 --> 11:34.456
Like the square from Connecticut!

11:34.457 --> 11:36.792
- Oh, thank God.
- Man, you're fucked up.

11:39.754 --> 11:41.463
- Lamar!
- No!

11:41.464 --> 11:43.465
- Yeah?
- I was just telling Malcolm

11:43.466 --> 11:46.135
about that hilarious
Bill Cosby routine you do!

11:46.136 --> 11:47.970
The one where he jokes
about putting Spanish fly

11:47.971 --> 11:50.431
in the girls' drinks.

11:50.432 --> 11:51.432
He joked about that?

11:51.433 --> 11:52.641
Yeah, Lamar, do the bit, man!

11:52.642 --> 11:54.852
- It's my birthday!
- Uhh.

11:54.853 --> 11:57.855
It's his birthday wish, man, do it!

12:09.019 --> 12:10.469
Fire.

12:15.165 --> 12:19.878
139 missions, 217 confirmed kills...

12:21.254 --> 12:23.047
and we're holding the goddamn perimeter.

12:23.048 --> 12:24.381
It's fucking pointless.

12:24.382 --> 12:25.466
Do you have a problem, soldier?

12:25.467 --> 12:27.342
Yeah, yeah, I've got a problem.

12:27.343 --> 12:29.762
The Tiger I know doesn't stand down.

12:29.763 --> 12:31.889
She fights, she leads.

12:31.890 --> 12:33.682
She kills without mercy.

12:33.683 --> 12:35.517
She doesn't take orders
from little fucking boys.

12:35.518 --> 12:37.227
Well, that was before a whole unit died

12:37.228 --> 12:38.772
because of me.

12:40.982 --> 12:43.233
Wait, because of you?

12:43.234 --> 12:45.152
Are you the one that shot them?

12:45.153 --> 12:46.695
Stabbed them?

12:46.696 --> 12:49.198
Raised their lifeless
bodies on flagpoles

12:49.199 --> 12:51.533
for all the world to see?

12:51.534 --> 12:53.202
Fed their innards to dogs,

12:53.203 --> 12:56.455
made ceremonial mugs
out of their skulls?

12:56.456 --> 13:00.751
No, hey, that wasn't you.

13:00.752 --> 13:03.879
That was the fucking Biotics.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.339
God, you don't get it, do you?

13:05.340 --> 13:07.049
When you plan a mission for years,

13:07.050 --> 13:08.967
and then 43 of your 44 commandos

13:08.968 --> 13:10.385
die on that mission,

13:10.386 --> 13:13.388
you feel a little responsible, Wolf.

13:13.389 --> 13:14.932
But if he succeeds in there,

13:14.933 --> 13:17.267
then our team wouldn't
have died in vain.

13:17.268 --> 13:18.727
Like it or not, he got us here.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.229
He knows this time.

13:20.230 --> 13:23.398
All we've been doing
is just fucking shit up.

13:23.399 --> 13:25.567
Have we been fucking shit up?

13:33.118 --> 13:34.993
Still think the perimeter's pointless?

13:34.994 --> 13:36.745
Okay.

13:36.746 --> 13:39.706
Okay, maybe there is
something to this guy.

13:39.707 --> 13:42.460
We got a... I'm not
really sure what this is.

13:47.006 --> 13:49.132
I think I've got a match
on the canner suspects.

13:49.133 --> 13:50.551
Yeah, we've got a guy in a cowboy hat

13:50.552 --> 13:51.760
and a girl with purple hair.

13:51.761 --> 13:53.637
I think it's the guys
who killed Santiago.

14:01.980 --> 14:04.147
First you take the Jell-O
and you shake it up

14:04.148 --> 14:05.774
and it gets more gelatinous,

14:05.775 --> 14:07.693
and then you take the Spanish fly

14:07.694 --> 14:09.278
and you put it in the Jell-O,

14:09.279 --> 14:11.196
and you give it to
the unsuspecting lady,

14:11.197 --> 14:13.490
and the lady goes "Wooo!"

14:13.491 --> 14:16.493
Okay, I mean, it's a
pretty good impression,

14:16.494 --> 14:18.787
but what do Bill Cosby and Jell-O

14:18.788 --> 14:20.622
have to do with each other?

14:20.623 --> 14:21.665
You told that joke so bad,

14:21.666 --> 14:23.750
it made me not like Bill Cosby.

14:23.751 --> 14:25.711
All right, well, get used to that.

14:25.712 --> 14:27.379
Uh, can I go now?

14:27.380 --> 14:28.672
Uh... Yeah, man.

14:28.673 --> 14:30.007
Happy birthday!

14:32.343 --> 14:33.760
Fuck!

14:33.761 --> 14:34.970
No!

14:44.314 --> 14:46.315
Move, motherfuckers!

14:55.658 --> 14:57.868
Oh, I... I am... I am so sorry!

14:57.869 --> 14:59.661
Let me... Let me get that for you.

14:59.662 --> 15:01.914
Oh, my God, I just... I made it worse.

15:01.915 --> 15:03.957
- I'm sorry.
- Mistakes happen, Pledge.

15:03.958 --> 15:06.502
- Yeah.
- Just, uh...

15:08.828 --> 15:09.838
Right.

15:11.674 --> 15:13.842
Sorry about that.

15:13.843 --> 15:15.552
That reefer made me thirsty!

15:15.553 --> 15:18.639
Oh, well let me wet your beautiful beak.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.184
Jesus, it's like this
motherfucker wants herpes.

15:24.395 --> 15:26.021
I can explain.

15:26.022 --> 15:28.273
Please do.

15:28.274 --> 15:30.984
There was a bee that
just flew right in the cup.

15:30.985 --> 15:32.194
- A bee.
- Yeah.

15:32.195 --> 15:35.030
Well, where the fuck is it?

15:35.031 --> 15:37.074
It muh... must've flown away.

15:40.536 --> 15:42.871
I need you to fly away.

15:42.872 --> 15:46.708
I am trying to fuck Barbarella here.

15:46.709 --> 15:48.168
Are you sure you want to do that?

15:48.169 --> 15:50.212
'Cause I heard a rumor that she's got...

15:50.213 --> 15:51.713
Oh, no, no, stop, stop, stop.

15:51.714 --> 15:53.298
Stop it right there.

15:53.299 --> 15:57.010
Whatever she's got, oh, I want.

15:57.011 --> 15:58.261
Now I didn't want to have to do this

15:58.262 --> 15:59.554
on the night of the moon landing,

15:59.555 --> 16:02.307
but you just earned yourself
bathroom duty, Pledge!

16:02.308 --> 16:04.309
You dig?

16:04.310 --> 16:05.560
I dig.

16:05.561 --> 16:07.729
There's Skarsgaard.

16:07.730 --> 16:09.648
Where are they? Let's get them!

16:09.649 --> 16:11.608
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, rook.

16:11.609 --> 16:14.403
They're down behind that weird barricade

16:14.404 --> 16:16.363
right in front of the
negro fraternity house.

16:16.364 --> 16:17.447
Shit.

16:17.448 --> 16:18.865
Those guys called us about 20 times

16:18.866 --> 16:21.952
about being harassed,
and we just ignored it.

16:21.953 --> 16:24.079
Can't ignore this.

16:27.375 --> 16:32.379
I'm Lieutenant Miller,
Pasadena Police Department!

16:32.380 --> 16:34.339
Draw down your weapons
and put your hands

16:34.340 --> 16:35.674
above your head!

16:35.675 --> 16:36.675
No!

16:36.676 --> 16:38.135
This house is under our control.

16:38.136 --> 16:40.137
None shall pass.

16:40.138 --> 16:42.139
We've got a hostage situation.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.366
Probably racially motivated.

16:44.367 --> 16:45.726
Yeah, well...

16:45.727 --> 16:48.979
Last thing we need is
another Watts on our hands.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.522
What is it you want?

16:50.523 --> 16:51.690
Money?

16:51.691 --> 16:55.819
- What's money?
- Oh, fuck.

16:55.820 --> 16:57.113
They're commies!

16:58.156 --> 16:59.406
We have no leverage.

16:59.407 --> 17:01.158
I've got your leverage right here.

17:01.159 --> 17:02.451
These bastards killed my partner.

17:02.452 --> 17:03.952
Why are we even negotiating with them?

17:03.953 --> 17:05.454
Get a hold of yourself, rook.

17:05.454 --> 17:08.165
I'm trying to prevent
a race riot over here.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.627
I'm still the janitor? God!

17:24.848 --> 17:27.309
Ah, shit, dirty dancing.

17:31.814 --> 17:35.150
Do you mind if I dance with your date?

17:35.151 --> 17:36.485
Of course I mind.

17:36.486 --> 17:40.405
Why wouldn't I mind?

17:40.406 --> 17:42.491
Damn, Kronish, you've got moves!

17:44.660 --> 17:47.371
Here's a little something
I brought with me from the future.

17:50.666 --> 17:52.084
This is called the Running Man!

17:52.085 --> 17:53.502
I just invented it!

17:53.503 --> 17:55.670
I don't know what you're talking about,

17:55.671 --> 17:56.713
but I like your moves!

17:56.714 --> 17:57.839
You know I'm the best dancer

17:57.840 --> 17:59.007
in this fraternity, right?

18:03.179 --> 18:04.805
Oh, no, they're totally in sync!

18:04.806 --> 18:06.348
Uh... here! Check this move out!

18:06.349 --> 18:07.850
Woo!

18:09.477 --> 18:10.852
Hey, ho!

18:15.024 --> 18:17.818
Why are you doing this?

18:17.819 --> 18:20.278
Just stop while you're ahead!

18:20.279 --> 18:21.863
What the fuck?

18:21.864 --> 18:24.032
Oh, shit, Jesus Christ!

18:26.994 --> 18:29.037
All right, we don't know

18:29.038 --> 18:33.750
what a phaso shaft scraper is,

18:33.751 --> 18:35.377
but we are working on getting you

18:35.378 --> 18:38.964
your jug of clean water,

18:38.965 --> 18:41.508
one plump cat,

18:41.509 --> 18:44.052
100 yards of netting,

18:44.053 --> 18:47.806
and various historical
textbooks of the era.

18:47.807 --> 18:49.891
Don't forget the pickles!

18:49.892 --> 18:51.351
The green kind!

18:51.352 --> 18:53.353
Look, this is gonna take a little while!

18:53.354 --> 18:55.021
Good!

18:55.022 --> 18:56.314
It's working.

19:09.412 --> 19:11.913
Everybody just sit tight.

19:11.914 --> 19:13.457
Don't move.

19:22.967 --> 19:25.594
Hey, pigs.

19:25.595 --> 19:27.512
We pay you for a reason,

19:27.513 --> 19:29.097
now back off.

19:29.098 --> 19:31.558
We want the people behind
that weird garbage wall.

19:31.559 --> 19:34.478
We've gonna have words with them.

19:34.479 --> 19:36.897
We know you pay us very well,

19:36.898 --> 19:39.816
but we've got a sensitive
hostage situation here.

19:39.817 --> 19:42.152
They stole our bikes.

19:42.153 --> 19:44.530
They fucked up Rick's fingers.

19:45.698 --> 19:47.449
Vacate the premises.

19:47.450 --> 19:49.951
Hand them over and we will.

19:49.952 --> 19:51.286
No.

19:51.287 --> 19:52.829
Go away.

20:01.464 --> 20:04.132
Hey, come here, follow me!

20:04.133 --> 20:06.259
Now is our chance
for payback, all right?

20:06.260 --> 20:08.303
This one is for Santiago.

20:08.304 --> 20:09.804
Let's go!

20:11.641 --> 20:12.766
They're trying to breach.

20:12.767 --> 20:13.767
Nice.

20:13.768 --> 20:16.311
- Remember.
- I know.

20:16.312 --> 20:18.188
Everything but killing.

20:52.056 --> 20:53.431
Hey!

20:53.432 --> 20:59.521
Santiago!

21:08.573 --> 21:09.739
Superman that hoe!

21:09.740 --> 21:11.866
Woo, Superman that hoe!

21:11.867 --> 21:13.243
Superman that hoe!

21:13.244 --> 21:14.494
What about the crowd, Lamar?

21:14.495 --> 21:16.746
I'm taking the whole crowd with me!

21:20.376 --> 21:22.711
Oh, God, he's got the crowd!

21:27.717 --> 21:30.595
It's one small step for man...

21:32.388 --> 21:34.389
Oh, my God, of course.

21:39.895 --> 21:41.438
Thank you, Michael.

21:42.476 --> 21:44.190
Hee-hee!

21:44.191 --> 21:45.609
Hoo-hoo!

21:49.035 --> 21:51.698
Hoo-hoo! Ha!

21:51.699 --> 21:53.575
Toe, slide, heel.

21:53.576 --> 21:54.784
Heel, slide.

21:54.785 --> 21:57.746
Heel, slide.

21:57.747 --> 21:59.722
Hoo-hoo! Ha!

22:08.633 --> 22:10.342
I won, it worked!

22:10.343 --> 22:12.427
I won a dance-off.

22:12.428 --> 22:13.678
Yo, Tito!

22:13.679 --> 22:14.763
You know that new dance move

22:14.764 --> 22:16.806
your little brother
Michael was looking for?

22:16.807 --> 22:19.059
Well, wait till you see this!

22:19.060 --> 22:21.686
I'll describe it to you!

22:21.687 --> 22:24.564
If you fuck half as good as you dance,

22:24.565 --> 22:27.275
I'm gonna be one happy girl.

22:30.947 --> 22:31.947
I did it!

22:31.948 --> 22:33.615
I cockblocked him!

22:42.291 --> 22:44.417
What's going on?

22:44.418 --> 22:46.461
Why is everyone chanting my name?

22:46.462 --> 22:49.381
- Oh, no.
- If that's Lamar,

22:49.382 --> 22:51.091
then who the fuck is that?

22:51.092 --> 22:52.884
Oh, shit.

22:52.885 --> 22:55.553
No, no!

22:55.554 --> 22:56.971
Colonel Sanders?

23:05.314 --> 23:07.315
Oh, shit, it's the cops!

23:08.901 --> 23:10.485
But they're attacking white people!

23:13.781 --> 23:15.323
Wooo!

23:21.497 --> 23:22.872
Huh.

23:22.873 --> 23:24.666
A black apple.

23:29.338 --> 23:31.339
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit!

23:40.349 --> 23:41.599
Jesus!

23:49.233 --> 23:50.650
Tiger, Wolf!

23:50.651 --> 23:52.318
It's time to go!

23:52.319 --> 23:53.746
Future Man.

23:53.747 --> 23:54.750
Let's go!

24:03.122 --> 24:05.373
Hey, I gotta piss!

24:07.710 --> 24:10.044
Future Man, did the
cockblock maneuver work?

24:10.045 --> 24:12.297
Yes, it worked,
but we've gotta... we gotta go!

24:12.298 --> 24:14.048
Wolf, fire up the TTV.

24:15.718 --> 24:17.761
Shit, we've gotta... we gotta go!
What's the plan?

24:17.762 --> 24:19.637
- Jump!
- I can't jump!

24:19.638 --> 24:22.557
- We need a better plan.
- You can do it, Future Man!

24:24.170 --> 24:25.185
Okay.

24:27.432 --> 24:28.897
Wish I still had the helmet.

24:28.898 --> 24:31.149
Jump, we'll catch you!

24:31.150 --> 24:34.611
Catch me!

24:35.988 --> 24:37.906
Right on my balls.

24:37.907 --> 24:39.283
Future Man, are you okay?

24:45.706 --> 24:47.540
Yeah.

24:47.541 --> 24:50.502
Yeah, I'm... I'm more than okay.

24:50.503 --> 24:51.503
I'm great!

24:51.504 --> 24:53.171
We did it!

24:53.172 --> 24:55.507
I cockblocked Kronish!

24:55.508 --> 24:57.509
I was wrong about you.

24:57.510 --> 24:59.260
You are the Savior.

25:09.104 --> 25:11.606
You did it.

25:11.607 --> 25:14.108
You saved the world.

25:18.322 --> 25:21.574
Ew! What the fuck is that?

25:21.575 --> 25:24.285
Did you just really try to go
rathole to rathole with me?

25:24.286 --> 25:25.870
I thought this whole thing was...

25:25.871 --> 25:27.580
You sick fuck.

25:27.581 --> 25:29.541
It's called a kiss!

25:29.542 --> 25:32.210
You... you call your mouths "ratholes"?

25:32.211 --> 25:34.921
What else would you call the hole
you shove rats into?

25:34.922 --> 25:37.423
It's does... doesn't matter,
okay, look, I...

25:37.424 --> 25:39.634
I stopped Kronish from getting herpes.

25:41.262 --> 25:42.595
I'm the Savior.

25:55.484 --> 25:57.318
Fuck me.
