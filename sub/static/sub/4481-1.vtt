Before you...

14:59.746 --> 15:01.246
A close friend with Kazue and Yuuka

15:02.266 --> 15:05.933
Sizuko went back home suddenly, 
because she was in failing health.

15:05.976 --> 15:08.376
But, That doesn't make any sense to me

15:08.592 --> 15:10.792
Named sizuko is not your fault, right?

15:11.276 --> 15:12.276
They are childish!

15:14.259 --> 15:15.259
Sizuko

15:19.746 --> 15:21.646
Is ther any problem?

15:25.062 --> 15:26.762

15:28.059 --> 15:29.359
You...

15:33.597 --> 15:35.897

16:09.061 --> 16:10.761
I think this is someone's private place.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.071

16:13.545 --> 16:15.345
This is my first entrance for a long time.

16:20.071 --> 16:21.904

16:22.295 --> 16:23.795

16:54.687 --> 16:57.287
Don't you afraid of contagion?

16:59.304 --> 17:01.437
Your mother looks well, I think.

17:02.678 --> 17:03.744
My mom was dead.

17:05.272 --> 17:08.073
I think that My father and
his new wife are worried about

17:08.983 --> 17:10.983
chance to be infected by me...

17:12.960 --> 17:14.426
It's cowardly of them.

17:15.787 --> 17:16.787
leave to Tokyo

17:20.020 --> 17:22.319
Open my heart, for
the first time.

20:03.816 --> 20:10.049
But Most important thing is Healthy

20:10.413 --> 20:16.913
Supplied medicine is for
immune system and metabolism

and make my head clear.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.247
I grow strong in health,
good sleep, gain weight.

20:46.674 --> 20:49.674
Other Sizuko... What was she like?

20:55.741 --> 20:58.241

21:10.593 --> 21:12.493
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything

21:15.086 --> 21:17.086

22:55.119 --> 22:56.919
I'm sorry. I made you upset.

23:00.493 --> 23:05.593
Am I upset? no, I can't be upset.
I'm a girl without settled convictions.

23:06.624 --> 23:13.224
Wow, Kazue makes greate efforts.
It looks more like a fait accompli

23:13.555 --> 23:15.955
What? / Tokyo...

23:16.088 --> 23:18.588
Everybody assure that 
Kazue and Yuuka will be selected.

23:18.945 --> 23:22.045
But she always work hard.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.375
She's a very unusal.

23:53.842 --> 23:55.842
What is there?

23:57.883 --> 24:00.983
Over the forrest... until the end?

24:01.327 --> 24:03.727
Nobody have been up to there.

24:04.712 --> 24:07.112

24:32.894 --> 24:38.094
I have never been to the sea.

24:39.331 --> 24:43.131
If I get to the sea.
Can I go to Tokyo?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.958
Tokyo must be good?

25:24.772 --> 25:31.172
Can we go without permission?
/Yes, We can't.

25:33.844 --> 25:36.844
Where do you plan to go?

25:38.715 --> 25:40.715
The sea.

26:41.103 --> 26:44.003
Is it nice?

26:44.634 --> 26:45.934
Yes...

26:49.416 --> 26:51.149
Why... are you nice to me?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.947

26:57.054 --> 26:59.454
What is that...

27:05.986 --> 27:08.986
And because you are really odd.
