WEBVTT

00:46.880 --> 00:51.550
THE DEVILS

02:16.219 --> 02:20.097
A painting is always
quite moral when it is tragic

02:20.181 --> 02:23.559
and it presents the horror
of the things it depicts.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.852
Barbey d'Aurevilly.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.670
DELSSALLE BOARDING SCHOOL

02:53.756 --> 02:55.257
- Monsieur Delassalle.
- Yes.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.677
It’s time I rang the bell.

02:58.761 --> 03:02.055
Go ahead. I’ll manage
unloading the car myself.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.718
- Your salads are rotten!
- You aren't paying for them.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.656
Line up, please.
And be quiet.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.449
Oh, what a pain.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.178
Lovely kids!

04:23.346 --> 04:25.514
Can't wait to flee this place.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.642
Get out!

04:34.190 --> 04:37.276
Do your eyes hurt, dear colleague?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.653
I hurt myself getting up.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.405
You're up early.

04:41.489 --> 04:44.032
Last night, I was doing
my rounds about 4:00 a.m.,

04:44.200 --> 04:46.702
and I heard screams
coming out of your room.

04:47.370 --> 04:52.291
The chaste woman loves to
contemplate dawn, doesn't she?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.584
You spent too much time
with the Jesuits, M. Drain.

04:55.003 --> 04:58.547
Not everyone can be thrown out
of the school system.

04:58.965 --> 04:59.881
Jerk!

05:01.801 --> 05:04.678
- Tiene, Seňora.
- Thank you, darling.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.557
Oh, it's so nice!

05:08.641 --> 05:10.684
We all need a vacation.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.228
The body needs to eliminate its toxins.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.272
Tomorrow, mademoiselle,
I’ll be all naked.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.317
And you, how did you plan
this long weekend?

05:18.401 --> 05:21.320
I’ll be home, in Niort.
Deux Sevres. Heard of it?

05:21.404 --> 05:24.197
Sous-Prefecture Maine,
Bressuire and Partenay.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.409
Getting some fresh air?

05:27.493 --> 05:29.536
It warms my heart, M. Drain.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.913
It still has the smell
of the country, mitierra.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.833
A graceful instrument,
but with all the rains,

05:34.917 --> 05:37.210
I prefer my old umbrella.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.588
In my country, instead of
your ugly black umbrella,

05:39.672 --> 05:41.757
you'd wear a straw sombrero

05:41.841 --> 05:44.426
and spend your breaks in a hammock.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.677
Perdon, seňora.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.181
It’s such a frivolous thing
to give an educator.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.684
Does your teacher
really look that way, José?

05:52.769 --> 05:55.187
Yes, sir. And he used to come
to school on a horse.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.647
I’ll never get used to it.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.776
I told him it was a horse
to please him.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.736
It was only a mule.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.321
Go play, Joselito.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.867
- What's the matter?
- Look.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.661
- Miguel.
- Of course, Michel.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.205
Who else?

06:13.998 --> 06:16.750
- Did you have another fight?
- He came back at 3:00 a.m.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.044
How have you stood him for so long?

06:19.128 --> 06:20.921
He wasn't always that way.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.715
At the beginning,
he really made me happy.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.133
It was for your money.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.553
Why are you trying to be nasty?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.680
Don't you think life
is hard enough for us?

06:30.765 --> 06:33.517
I may be a bit old-fashioned,

06:33.601 --> 06:35.811
but this is absolutely astounding.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.898
The legal wife consoling the mistress.

06:39.982 --> 06:40.982
No, no and no.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.276
I should go.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.362
It’s my turn to be at recess today.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.072
Tidy yourself up.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.075
With your heart condition,
you should let the others work.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.119
Excuse me, madame.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.205
Come.
I have something to show you.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.998
What?

06:57.083 --> 06:58.917
Something.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.572
What the hell
are you both doing here?

07:28.656 --> 07:29.865
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.534
Like kids. Nothing.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.787
Come on and kiss me!

07:35.872 --> 07:38.165
- Did you look at me?
- Are you still angry?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.836
What about you, Cricri?
Got a kiss for your husband?

07:44.213 --> 07:45.881
Come here.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.388
Aren't you supposed to be
at recess today?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.390
I told her to stay.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.851
Don't you see how she looks?
- Exactly. She needs air.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.687
And her shoes.
Did you see the soles?

08:00.771 --> 08:04.065
I’ve always told her to buy
heavy shoes, real clodhoppers.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.651
A sick person shouldn't worry
about her appearance.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.361
I’m not sick.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.114
- She's delicate, you know it.
- Delicate?

08:11.908 --> 08:14.326
Yes, when she came from Caracas.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.496
Today, she's a cute little ruin.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.624
She doesn't risk anything.
Ruins are indestructible.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.544
She'll bury us all.
Won't you, my little ruin?

08:25.254 --> 08:27.422
That's enough.
Go out and play, both of you.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.057
Yes, a dark little bottle.

08:37.140 --> 08:40.184
She smelled it like that,
and it wasn't perfume.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.312
I can tell you, they drink.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.188
That's why they're always together.

08:44.273 --> 08:47.943
- What was in the bottle?
- Whiskey, idiot!

08:53.950 --> 08:56.618
Please, I don't want to hear
about that anymore.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.581
Patard, if you want
to spend your vacation here,

09:01.666 --> 09:03.333
you’ll have lots of time to draw.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.882
M. Patard, you heard.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.718
No vacation for you.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.303
Go on.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.933
Miguel.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.394
Miguel, what's the matter with you?

09:22.478 --> 09:24.980
I didn't want to punish him.
- So don't threaten him.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.149
Patard did very well
on his English quiz.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.735
That's no reason to degrade school grounds.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.784
I won't have any regrets.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.424
No. I can't. I can't.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.427
I didneven have the courage
to divorce him.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.263
Do you still love him?

09:58.347 --> 09:59.973
Of course not.
You can't understand.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.600
Am I stupid?

10:01.684 --> 10:04.519
- Divorce is a deadly sin.
- Really!

10:04.604 --> 10:05.604
See?

10:05.688 --> 10:08.106
And what about the knife
you carried around for a month?

10:08.190 --> 10:10.108
Wasn't that a deadly sin?

10:10.192 --> 10:12.402
I was jealous. I was mad.

10:12.486 --> 10:15.572
But to concoct this thing... No.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.575
As you wish. But think about it.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.452
We’ll never find a better opportunity.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.787
And we have just three days.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.707
Everyone knows I’m leaving for Niort.
You'll come and rest.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.668
Don't you believe in hell?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.420
Not since I was seven.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.005
I do.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.686
- Fish again?
- Not fish again.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.438
It’s the same fish as last night.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.483
- Make me two fried eggs.
- You're not gonna start, are you?

10:51.567 --> 10:53.526
I put in a quart of vinegar
and two pounds of onions.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.321
I’m not saying it's bad.
But, you can smell that it's fish.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.906
It stinks.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.078
Yes, yes, later, later.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.710
No, thank you.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.380
- Help yourself.
- I’m not hungry.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.800
You must set an example.
My liver doesn't allow me fat.

11:19.929 --> 11:23.264
M. Delassalle, may I ask
for a glass of wine?

11:24.475 --> 11:27.435
- You already had two.
- Only one.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.020
Only one.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.772
Well.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.994
"Bonum vinum laetificat cor hominis."

11:51.252 --> 11:54.337
- What is it? A bone?
- I told you I wasn't hungry.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.922
I’m asking you to eat.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.186
- Swallow!
- I can't help it. I just can't.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.479
Swallow.

12:15.609 --> 12:19.779
- Delicious fish, M. Raymond?
- Perfect. Perfect.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.531
It seems extremely...

12:22.825 --> 12:24.659
extremely nutritious.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.623
You should serve these lads
some mad cow.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.042
Be quiet or I’ll keep you all
here this weekend. Swallow.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.680
Everyone is looking at you.
Swallow.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.605
- It’s disgusting.
- Sorry?

12:53.689 --> 12:56.357
Some things are hard to swallow.
I’m not talking about the fish.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.610
We want food!

12:58.694 --> 13:01.988
M. Drain, throw
these hooligans out of here.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.449
What is this supposed to be?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.785
You're going to eat your fish.
And quietly.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.413
-I told you to throw them out.
-Yes, sir.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.499
We want food!

13:18.422 --> 13:22.550
- M. Raymond, go help your colleague.
- Right away, sir.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.390
Get out, everybody. What is this?

13:32.812 --> 13:38.191
Get out and be careful.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.487
What kind of a supper is it
for these growing boys?

13:42.571 --> 13:44.614
A slice of sausage and
two spoons of mashed potatoes?

13:44.698 --> 13:46.366
They should've eaten
what they were served.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.952
In the army...

13:49.036 --> 13:50.829
You're not an adjutant
But a soup merchant.

13:50.913 --> 13:54.374
- I can't buy coalfish for 3000 francs.
- You'd rather make them sick.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.960
As a kid, we used to buy whiting.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.337
Coalfish was too expensive.

13:59.421 --> 14:03.383
They need expensive fish. I buy it,
but at a price that I can afford.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.010
It’s a mistake to buy on sale.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.471
The fish vendor's smarter than us.
You get what you pay for.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.015
It’s not his money. It's mine.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.101
I’m paying for everything here.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.186
I’m paying for the doorkeeper.
And M. Drain.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.814
l even paid Germaine,
Sabine, Therese.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.942
I’m paying you too, Nicole.
I accept it. I keep quiet.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.779
But when he attacks the kids,
it disgusts me.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.990
I can't stand it.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.633
Calm down. It’s not good for you.

14:47.261 --> 14:50.638
I’d like to die,
and not see him anymore.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.224
Die, my sweet.
Die quickly.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.978
We’ll have a nice funeral for you,
and we'll finally be rid of you.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.980
The school won't suffer...

14:59.064 --> 15:01.316
and I’ll feel much better.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.320
Well, children, have fun.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.406
I have to wake up early.
I’ll go and pack.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.033
Well, so...

15:12.328 --> 15:14.245
I’m leaving at 7:00 a.m.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.626
Have a nice vacation, darling.
Take care.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.502
Good night, you.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.923
What a great vacation...

15:27.843 --> 15:29.510
A three-day honeymoon.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.777
No, no...

17:49.526 --> 17:50.818
Nicole!

17:55.657 --> 17:57.158
Nicole!

17:58.702 --> 18:00.912
I’m up here.
I’m coming down.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.292
What are you doing?

18:10.839 --> 18:12.507
Watch out! Stand back!

18:34.988 --> 18:38.449
Those riding the bus,
raise your hands.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.410
Will your sister still be
in the bathroom?

18:41.495 --> 18:43.871
lf we get there before 1 0:00.
You’ll see, I made a hole.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.290
- Give me the pack back!
- You'll see my sister naked.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.543
- It’s worth a pack a cigarettes.
- No! Give them back!

18:48.627 --> 18:51.170
Soudieu, aren't you part of our group?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.631
No. We’ll share a cab, the four of us.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.551
Money is pouring out of your pockets.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.472
Don't you have a suitcase,
de Gasquet?

19:01.557 --> 19:04.225
The chauffeur will take it.
That's what we pay him for.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.232
Our personal chauffeurs don't
do their job right, dear friend.

19:13.068 --> 19:16.279
- Have a nice vacation, sir.
- Nice vacation, sir.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.114
Thank you.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.408
Plantiveau.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.578
Did madame come down?

19:24.371 --> 19:27.707
I was ringing the bell when they
drove through the gate. I opened it.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.292
Both of them?

19:29.376 --> 19:32.378
Mme. Delassalle and Mlle. Horner.
They took the truck.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.589
I thought you knew.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.340
Of course, I knew.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.468
I just forgot.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.515
Except that it's a problem.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.270
Especially for these gentlemen.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.982
One of you must stay
to watch those on detention.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.873
You must feel strange
coming back to Niort.

20:08.957 --> 20:09.749
Why?

20:09.833 --> 20:11.876
Didn't you get into trouble
in high school?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.294
Trouble...

20:13.378 --> 20:15.379
I resigned, that's all.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.548
- Do you still have your parents?
- No.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.636
I’ve got a couple of teachers
living upstairs.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.554
What?
There are people in the house?

20:23.639 --> 20:26.015
I thought about it.
I thought about everything.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.934
I promise there's nothing to worry about.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.154
Are you tired?
Do you need me to drive?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.739
You can't drive.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.658
I could never afford a car.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.409
This way, I cannot think.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.246
Good. So keep driving.
Keep your nerves for tomorrow.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.249
- We'll never have the courage.
- You don't know me.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.833
Yes, I know you.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.710
Very well.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.797
You can wish someone's death,
but kill...

20:58.465 --> 21:01.092
You probably wished me dead at times...

21:01.176 --> 21:02.843
I didn't. But he did.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.222
He would say to me,
"Don't worry.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.224
With her heart condition,
it won't take long.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.434
After she dies,
we'll share the school."

21:10.519 --> 21:13.271
- It’s horrible!
- Don't you believe me?

21:13.355 --> 21:15.356
What did you answer?

21:17.693 --> 21:20.444
- Do you want me to be honest?
- if you can.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.491
I didnknow you that well...

21:25.575 --> 21:28.327
I’d rather not know.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.391
Watch your step.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.900
Mlle. Horner!
What a surprise!

22:41.568 --> 22:43.069
Don't bother.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.375
What a huge trunk.

22:57.459 --> 23:01.379
It always upsets M. Herboux
when I take more than a suitcase.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.172
Good evening.

23:03.256 --> 23:07.510
Mme. Herboux, M.A. in grammar.
Mme. Delassalle, my principal.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.846
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.557
I haven't received the rent.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.310
Don't torture me.
I’m so embarrassed.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.896
I thought of giving it to you
tomorrow or the day after.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.858
But we didn't get paid for
the examinations in Vausson.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.361
We were counting on that money.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.988
But don't worry, I’ll come tonight.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.574
No need. I’ll come up tomorrow.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.035
We're a little tired tonight.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.538
Yes, she looks sick.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.838
Make yourself at home.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.348
Home, sweet home.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.185
Turn off the light. It’s a waste.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.611
- Already?
- Let's do it now and forget about it.

24:07.696 --> 24:11.115
Hello, operator.
I’d like a line to St. Cloud.

24:11.199 --> 24:14.535
The number is Molitor 27.45.
Τhank you.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.717
I like to have my feet free.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.554
When it's cold, I put on ski socks
instead of slippers.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.567
Go ahead.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.570
What are you waiting for?

24:49.654 --> 24:52.406
You see, it doesn't bite.
And it doesn't hit.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.830
Hello? Who is it?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.874
Answer, for God's sake!

25:03.168 --> 25:05.377
It’s you!

25:06.129 --> 25:08.589
From Niort. My compliments!

25:08.673 --> 25:11.175
You think I can afford a weekend
in the Poitou for you?

25:11.843 --> 25:15.054
What about the gas?
What are you talking about?

25:15.138 --> 25:18.182
I’m telling you that
we need to separate.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.643
Yes, I want a divorce.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.437
You are young, you are strong.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.231
You can make a nice living.

25:27.984 --> 25:32.863
The school was part of my dowry,
so I’ll take it back.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.116
We'll start the proceedings
right after the holidays.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.247
- What?
- Don't give me that crap. I’m coming.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.291
I’ll take a train tomorrow.
I’ll meet you at Nicole's.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.384
So?

25:53.468 --> 25:56.470
He's coming tomorrow
on the evening train.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.699
Well, Germaine?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.971
- You're nuts. You'll catch cold.
- I’m not cold. I’m suffocating.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.869
- You've got a fever.
- No, I’m just hot.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.789
I thought you'd never come back.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.499
That he'd get here before you.

27:07.584 --> 27:11.086
It doesn't always go as you want it to.
That's life. Everything was closed.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.131
Did you buy a tablecloth?

27:14.215 --> 27:18.886
Yes, a nylon, waterproof one.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.847
It’s too big!

27:22.515 --> 27:24.058
Not too big for him.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.941
See that?

27:33.026 --> 27:36.028
Guess how much.
2500 francs.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.489
They aren't losing money on this.

27:38.573 --> 27:40.240
Let's open it.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.826
That way it won't look weird.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.584
Well, let's not waste it.

27:53.922 --> 27:58.092
- Here, it will cheer you up.
- No.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.181
You should, it's not bad at all.
I’ve never had it before.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.934
- You're supposed to put water in it.
- It would be a waste.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.520
Hand me the small bottle.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.863
- Won't he notice anything?
- Not a thing.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.409
He'll sleep like a log.

28:23.493 --> 28:27.204
- You're sure it won't leave traces?
- None.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.456
It’s a sedative. He'll digest it.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.125
I’m sure he won't come.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.047
That's him.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.425
That's his train passing
the Ackerman bridge.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.885
Put that over there.

29:00.655 --> 29:01.655
Stop.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.241
Please, stop.

29:04.325 --> 29:05.659
It’s too awful.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.623
- We must fill it up.
- I can't do it.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.460
I can't do it, not today.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.672
We must do it,
and you know it as well as I do.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.216
It’s either today or never.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.926
Then never!

29:23.011 --> 29:25.596
Let's forget about it.
I can't handle this.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.562
As you wish.
But I must warn you.

29:33.646 --> 29:36.106
lf you miss your chance,
he won't miss his.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.400
Not after your phone call.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.153
I don't know.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.530
I just don't know anymore.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.576
Nicole, please, help me.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.746
What for?
You can't handle it anyway.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.041
I should never have trusted you.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.711
I got involved too,
and you abandoned me.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.672
Yes, you're right.
I’m not worth anything.

30:00.757 --> 30:04.468
I’m just a ruin, a little ruin.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.637
That's what he said.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.347
But...

30:08.431 --> 30:10.516
the little ruin
will get her revenge.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.434
She'll find the strength.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.686
Even if she collapses afterward.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.481
My only regret

30:17.565 --> 30:20.317
is that he'll never know
that I killed him.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.860
Come on.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.905
Before you were giving up,
now you're excited.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.992
What you need is to relax.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.869
Relax a lot.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.830
You must keep cool.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.498
I will.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.250
I swear that I will.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.173
I must go upstairs and see them.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.217
Can't you stay with me?

30:45.885 --> 30:50.138
if the Herbouxes look out the window
and see him come in...

30:50.223 --> 30:51.849
You'll come right away, won't you?

30:51.933 --> 30:54.101
As fast as I can, I promise.

30:54.936 --> 30:59.606
Be brave. In half an hour,
it will all be over.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.267
I’ll find her a husband.
I’ll redeem myself.

31:35.351 --> 31:38.812
She's young, she'll be rich
and she'll be happy.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.857
Please, God, do not do this!
- Miss Horner.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.610
I wasn't expecting you tonight.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.905
Mme. Delassalle is resting
and I’m not tired.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.616
- May I come in?
- Please, do.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.328
We were listening to the radio as
we finished our dinner.

31:55.830 --> 31:58.749
The drama show is over.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.835
ZapiMax starts in 35 seconds.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.379
Dear listeners, you've just heard...

32:04.464 --> 32:08.550
"Don't Trifle with Love"
by Alfred de Musset.

32:40.792 --> 32:41.792
My God!

33:00.937 --> 33:03.730
- Good evening, Michel.
- Good evening.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.066
Come in.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.246
So, are you proud of yourself?

33:19.330 --> 33:21.623
Not so loud, the neighbors.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.417
Don't worry.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.419
I don't want to be noticed.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.588
A man who runs after his wife
is ridiculous enough.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.967
I left the school like a thief.

33:33.177 --> 33:36.847
I had to hide from Plantiveau.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.765
Hiding from my own porter!

33:39.475 --> 33:41.143
It’s humiliating.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.271
I couldn't tell him where I was going!

33:46.357 --> 33:49.693
You have forced me to come,
what are you waiting for?

33:49.777 --> 33:51.903
- What?
- Pack your bags.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.490
- No.
- What?

33:56.951 --> 33:59.578
- I’m staying.
- Are you refusing to come?

33:59.662 --> 34:01.663
I thought that was clear.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.540
I’ll come back after our divorce.

34:03.624 --> 34:06.710
You have decided to divorce?

34:06.794 --> 34:07.961
Yes.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.338
With your religious beliefs?

34:10.422 --> 34:12.716
I won't get married again, that's all.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.761
But getting a divorce
is like getting married,

34:15.844 --> 34:17.888
we must both agree.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.931
My Lawyer doesn't think so.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.516
You have a lawyer?

34:22.726 --> 34:26.563
- Attorney Berthoux, 64 Victor Hugo.
- Berthoux?

34:26.647 --> 34:29.483
You can check in the phone book.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.818
l went to see him this morning...

34:31.902 --> 34:35.655
and he assured me that I’d get
the legal separation quickly.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.617
He told you that?
Free of charge?

34:38.701 --> 34:40.202
Funny lawyer!

34:41.496 --> 34:43.246
Of course, I told him -

34:43.331 --> 34:44.831
You told him...

34:45.917 --> 34:47.793
all of our secrets
about our private life.

34:47.877 --> 34:51.670
You told everything to a stranger?
An animal who enjoyed every word of it?

34:52.340 --> 34:55.675
To think you grew up in a convent!

34:56.761 --> 34:59.971
You know what? It’s disgusting!

35:00.640 --> 35:04.184
Didn't you talk about us
to your lovers?

35:04.268 --> 35:06.394
Do we still have secrets?

35:06.479 --> 35:08.605
Is there anything that Nicole
doesn't know?

35:08.689 --> 35:12.275
if you believe her!
Two words, three lies.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.194
There are details that
she couldn't have invented.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.947
She can invent anything!

35:18.074 --> 35:20.075
God knows what she told the lawyer!

35:20.868 --> 35:22.702
- I’ll go see him, and put things straight.
- No!

35:22.787 --> 35:25.455
- You won't stop me.
- No, later. Tomorrow.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.624
- He's probably having supper now.
- Well, I didn't eat.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.502
- He won't see you.
- When he hears I came up from Paris -

35:30.586 --> 35:31.962
Don't.

35:32.046 --> 35:35.215
I didnsee a lawyer.
I lied to you.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.510
You too?

35:39.679 --> 35:41.346
It’s contagious.

35:44.016 --> 35:48.895
So, what about the divorce,
was that a lie too?

35:48.980 --> 35:52.107
No, I really want the divorce.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.317
It’s the only way.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.069
For your sake as well, Michel.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.322
It will be better for both of us.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.908
Come on, Cricri.
You can't be serious.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.828
Do you know the price of a divorce?

36:04.912 --> 36:07.164
And what about the scandal?

36:07.248 --> 36:08.748
What scandal?

36:08.833 --> 36:11.835
I’ll have to take a lawyer
to defend myself.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.714
And lawyers never stop talking.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.259
if you think parents will continue
to send you their kids.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.178
They'll take the students
away from me?

36:21.262 --> 36:22.888
Of course. You'll go bankrupt.

36:22.972 --> 36:26.183
Not that I care much. if it were up to me,
I would have sold it a long time ago.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.102
With your money and my contacts

36:29.187 --> 36:31.104
I’d have gone into business.

36:32.440 --> 36:37.235
We could have lived comfortably.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.948
But you wanted this kid business.
I gave in.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.700
It was security.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.744
Some deal!

36:45.828 --> 36:47.871
We traded in the big car
for a small one.

36:47.955 --> 36:50.332
I gave up my training.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.167
l wear decrepit suits.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.337
We are rich and we live
like poor people.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.422
Do you know how I paid for my trip?

36:58.925 --> 37:01.968
I sold my Larousse dictionary,
my main work tool.

37:05.348 --> 37:08.016
I did it all for you.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.727
I don't regret it.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.646
But when you throw me out,

37:13.564 --> 37:15.941
it upsets me, Cricri.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.525
It really upsets me.

37:18.653 --> 37:22.447
You know, you made me miserable.

37:23.115 --> 37:26.326
We used to fight,
like every other couple.

37:28.329 --> 37:31.414
What have we got here?
Not too shabby.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.499
Wait.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.377
Don't lie.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.088
You mustn't lie now.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.340
You've made me very unhappy.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.593
You might not have been aware of it,

37:43.678 --> 37:45.428
but it's the truth.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.805
Ask Nicole.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.766
Please, don't talk about that bitch.
She's setting you up against me.

37:49.850 --> 37:52.435
She exploits the fact that you're sick.
Nice way of thinking!

37:52.520 --> 37:54.020
Yes.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.606
She's got knowledge, taste...

37:56.691 --> 37:59.359
- Taste?
- Yes, but a bad attitude.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.152
That's it. I’m firing her right away.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.655
We’ll replace her with a man.
A good, honest, old man.

38:03.739 --> 38:04.406
Michel!

38:04.490 --> 38:06.449
For God's sake!
My Prince of Wales suit!

38:06.534 --> 38:07.534
You idiot!

38:07.618 --> 38:09.369
Go get a handkerchief, a towel!

38:09.453 --> 38:11.413
It will stain and I’ll reek of alcohol.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.207
Go!

38:20.381 --> 38:22.048
Here and here.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.509
There!

38:24.593 --> 38:26.636
It doesn't pay to be nice to you.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.139
I’ll train you, girl.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.322
Well, what are you waiting for?

39:01.005 --> 39:02.922
Get some hot water, damn it!

39:13.267 --> 39:16.853
We're leaving now and we'll get back
tomorrow morning.

39:16.937 --> 39:20.023
How long did you have to drive?
Ten, twelve hours?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.443
Well, answer!

39:25.529 --> 39:28.281
Can't you talk?

39:32.244 --> 39:34.579
Hey, Mrs. Worldly!

39:36.665 --> 39:38.500
How about another glass?

39:44.882 --> 39:47.550
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm dizzy.

39:50.137 --> 39:52.097
You forget how to pour?

39:55.518 --> 39:57.352
That's enough.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.483
Nice color.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.448
Stop looking at me
with your insane eyes.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.828
It’s all expenses paid, isn't it?

40:17.998 --> 40:22.252
By the way, where is our host?
Is she scared? Hiding?

40:22.336 --> 40:25.130
She's upstairs visiting the tenants.

40:25.214 --> 40:28.591
Mademoiselle has tenants.
She never told me that.

40:33.305 --> 40:34.973
I’m exhausted.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.392
It’s the train.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.144
Just lie down.

40:41.313 --> 40:44.566
- Whose bed is this? Hers or yours?
- Ours.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.359
Funny.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.697
Shoes. Take off my shoes.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.124
What's the matter with me tonight?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.135
I don't want to sleep.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.180
I don't want to sleep.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.435
We have to leave.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.195
What are you doing?

41:33.282 --> 41:34.782
Just sleep.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.826
Why did you turn off the light?

41:41.624 --> 41:43.583
I’m so tired!

41:45.294 --> 41:47.504
What's the matter?

41:47.588 --> 41:50.590
Nothing. Go to sleep.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.431
How did you get in?

41:58.516 --> 42:00.642
I came through this door.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.352
How many drinks did he have?

42:02.436 --> 42:03.603
Three.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.981
He was very good.

42:17.117 --> 42:18.618
He's dreaming.

42:38.847 --> 42:40.640
He's ready. We can take him.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.812
Take off his shoes.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.911
What the hell is she doing?

43:01.996 --> 43:03.705
She's taking a bath.

43:03.789 --> 43:06.207
At 1 0:00 p.m.? Funny habits.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.293
What a pest!

43:08.377 --> 43:13.047
Tell me, sir, where are
the Straits of Mozambique?

43:13.132 --> 43:15.425
Between Madagascar and Africa!

43:15.509 --> 43:18.428
It is precisely located between
Madagascar and the Coast of Africa.

43:18.512 --> 43:20.013
Bravo, sir!

43:22.516 --> 43:25.602
- 32,000 francs!
- 32,000 francs!

43:25.686 --> 43:30.148
I must ask you now,
do you stop or do you carry on?

43:30.232 --> 43:32.150
- I will go on.
- Of course, I carry on.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.735
He will go on!

43:35.362 --> 43:37.030
I can't hear a thing!

43:37.781 --> 43:39.449
Right when I’m winning 32,000 francs!

43:39.533 --> 43:41.409
Poor baby!

43:41.493 --> 43:43.703
Bitches! Bitches!
Daughters of bitches!

43:43.787 --> 43:46.873
- Only six seconds remaining.
- I didn't even hear the question!

43:47.708 --> 43:50.710
Midnight baths!
The decline of Rome!

43:53.130 --> 43:55.214
She's interfering with my enjoyment!

43:55.299 --> 43:57.967
I have the right to send her
a registered letter.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.553
And I’m not saying that I won't do it.

44:02.056 --> 44:08.978
The 1 7th at 1 0:05- 06 p.m.

44:10.272 --> 44:11.939
What are you looking for?

44:12.983 --> 44:14.651
His return ticket.

44:16.695 --> 44:18.196
Here it is.

44:18.947 --> 44:21.115
With the restaurant bill.

44:24.370 --> 44:25.286
Burn it.

44:45.474 --> 44:46.974
Let's go.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.894
You take the feet. It’s lighter.

44:49.978 --> 44:51.062
Together.

45:37.025 --> 45:38.693
The statue.

45:40.487 --> 45:42.655
The statue on the mantel.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.177
Give it to me.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.349
Now, the tablecloth.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.688
The tablecloth.

46:49.556 --> 46:51.057
It’s over.

46:56.188 --> 46:58.105
Did he suffer?

46:59.983 --> 47:02.151
He didn't feel anything.

47:02.236 --> 47:05.738
Let's go right away
and bring him back tonight.

47:06.865 --> 47:08.699
What about our alibi?

47:08.784 --> 47:11.118
When they find him,
we’ll have to be able to prove

47:11.203 --> 47:13.037
that we were here the day he died.

47:14.164 --> 47:16.082
That's why I’m using
the idiots upstairs.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.459
She still hasn't emptied the tub.

47:18.544 --> 47:21.212
- So what?
- So I can't go to sleep.

47:21.296 --> 47:24.048
When she opens the drain,
the noise will start again.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.008
It won't fall on your bed.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.594
I can't sleep near Niagara Falls.

47:29.596 --> 47:31.764
Are you planning to stay up all night?

47:31.849 --> 47:33.349
I’m sitting down.

47:36.603 --> 47:38.271
I’ll give her until midnight.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.374
Here they are!

47:58.458 --> 48:00.126
They took their time.

48:00.210 --> 48:03.546
When I passed by the café at 1 2:00,
they were already there.

48:04.172 --> 48:05.756
They must know
how much it costs them.

48:05.841 --> 48:08.342
if you were a landlord,
and I a school principal...

48:08.427 --> 48:09.552
Sure.

48:09.636 --> 48:11.762
We could also afford good meals.

48:13.265 --> 48:14.849
Well, I’m going to take a nap.

48:19.396 --> 48:21.981
Here we go, the flood!

48:46.465 --> 48:49.383
- What's the matter?
- He's so ugly!

48:59.394 --> 49:01.228
I’ve had it!

49:01.313 --> 49:03.147
I can't wait for them to leave!

49:10.697 --> 49:12.907
Too bad you're leaving us so soon.

49:12.991 --> 49:14.825
It was so nice to have company.

49:14.910 --> 49:17.954
You know, school starts tomorrow.

49:18.038 --> 49:20.081
For us as well as for you.

49:20.165 --> 49:22.458
I just came to get my dishes.

49:22.542 --> 49:24.335
It’s quite heavy.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.548
Wait a minute.
Would you have a piece of string?

49:29.633 --> 49:31.884
A piece of string? No.

49:33.720 --> 49:37.056
Wait. This might help you.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.059
I’ll try, yes.

49:40.852 --> 49:43.229
Let me do it.
it’ll be easier for you.

49:44.773 --> 49:47.066
It won't work.
Your trunk is crammed too full.

49:47.150 --> 49:49.485
- Let's take some things out.
- No, no.

49:49.569 --> 49:51.737
Yes. I’ll bring you the old tin trunk.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.281
It’s very strong.
It went through the 1 940 retreat.

49:54.366 --> 49:57.493
Start emptying the basket!
- No, it’ll be fine.

49:57.577 --> 50:01.080
- We're already late, aren't we, Nicole?
- That's what I told them.

50:01.164 --> 50:04.625
Anyway, it's fine now.
We can load.

50:04.710 --> 50:06.585
Watch out! Clear the way!

50:09.923 --> 50:11.424
On my command.

50:11.508 --> 50:13.009
One, two!

50:15.387 --> 50:18.264
Now, it'll be easy.
A little kick in the ass.

50:19.766 --> 50:21.434
I’ll start the engine.

50:27.649 --> 50:29.942
- That's it!
- As you say!

50:30.610 --> 50:32.653
M. Herboux, thank you for your help.

50:32.738 --> 50:36.490
- Don't mention it.
- All the same...

50:36.575 --> 50:39.577
- Here, this is for the road.
- Thank you, madame.

50:39.661 --> 50:41.704
Drive carefully,
the roads are dangerous.

50:41.788 --> 50:43.748
They have mobilized 1 500 policemen.

50:43.832 --> 50:45.708
You'll find one at every crossroad.

50:45.792 --> 50:48.502
Good-bye, madame.
And thank you again.

50:48.587 --> 50:50.546
- Have a good trip.
- See you soon!

51:14.571 --> 51:16.405
We're scot-free this time.

51:16.490 --> 51:19.658
- Sooner or later...
- Great.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.535
There is only one possible end.

51:21.620 --> 51:24.663
We are monsters.
I don't like monsters.

51:24.748 --> 51:27.083
lf it's only him, I feel better.

51:27.167 --> 51:29.543
I’ll save the grain of sand
falling from the hands of providence

51:29.628 --> 51:31.545
for my morality lessons.

51:43.725 --> 51:45.267
You jerk!

51:53.193 --> 51:55.611
It is about time!
All the gas stations were empty!

51:55.695 --> 51:58.197
No wonder! It was crazy today.

51:58.281 --> 51:59.782
Wait.

51:59.866 --> 52:02.034
There is always some
left in the bottom.

52:04.788 --> 52:06.455
963 francs.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.332
I only have a 5,000 franc bill.

52:08.416 --> 52:10.084
Come with me.
I’ll get some change.

52:19.678 --> 52:23.097
- Are you going to Tours?
- No, I’m not.

52:23.181 --> 52:26.392
Could you give me a lift?

52:26.476 --> 52:29.562
The bus driver wouldn't take me.

52:29.646 --> 52:32.648
He's anti-militarist, like me.

52:32.732 --> 52:35.359
We are already two.
Can't you see there's no room?

52:35.443 --> 52:39.238
I won't take room.
A second class soldier.

52:39.322 --> 52:43.117
if I don't report,
they’ll throw me in the slammer.

52:43.201 --> 52:45.327
Have some pity for a soldier.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.329
Leave me alone. You're drunk.

52:47.414 --> 52:50.457
Me? Hey, you!

52:50.542 --> 52:52.168
I’m being polite.

52:52.252 --> 52:53.919
And if that's the way it is,

52:54.004 --> 52:55.921
I’ll just get into your car.

52:58.675 --> 53:02.094
I won't let you. Do you hear me?

53:02.179 --> 53:03.762
Nicole!

53:04.431 --> 53:06.265
Would you get out!

53:08.101 --> 53:10.978
- What is it?
- Don't worry.

53:11.062 --> 53:13.314
He's drunk. I know him.
He's not a bad guy.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.232
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Robert.

53:17.235 --> 53:19.653
Get out of here,
or I’ll push you out myself.

53:29.956 --> 53:31.874
The pig. What did he do?

53:31.958 --> 53:34.293
The floor is all wet.
I’ll clean it.

53:34.377 --> 53:37.880
No, no need.
We're in a hurry. Thank you.

53:39.633 --> 53:42.301
Start the car.
There's a hole in the nylon!

53:52.229 --> 53:54.063
Did you hear that?

53:54.981 --> 53:58.567
- It sounds like the boss.
- He decided to come back.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.361
It’s about time!

54:04.282 --> 54:06.617
isn’t it too late
to make all this racket?

54:06.701 --> 54:09.036
lf we only ring,
Plantiveau won't open.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.163
Three short strokes,
that's Michel's signal.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.207
Plantiveau is a heavy sleeper.

54:13.291 --> 54:15.292
I’ll wake him up!

54:17.712 --> 54:19.713
Come on, Plantiveau!

54:21.216 --> 54:24.051
It’s you?
I thought it was M. Delassalle.

54:24.135 --> 54:26.595
What? isn’t he here?

54:26.680 --> 54:28.806
How should I know?
Ask him when you see him.

54:32.978 --> 54:36.480
- You look tired.
- Are you surprised?

54:39.734 --> 54:40.859
You can go.

54:46.741 --> 54:49.076
Sorry to wake you.
Good night.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.661
Good night.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.166
Turn off the headlights.
No need to parade our little number.

54:56.251 --> 54:57.751
No music either then!

55:53.641 --> 55:55.642
Not now.

56:21.628 --> 56:23.295
Go around.

57:08.258 --> 57:10.259
That's the bathroom light

57:10.343 --> 57:11.802
It’s Pascual.

57:11.886 --> 57:14.221
I heard he gets up every night.

57:14.305 --> 57:16.140
He might look out the window.

57:25.942 --> 57:27.609
Come on, quick.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.786
Come on.

58:08.651 --> 58:10.736
- Can you see him from here?
- No.

58:11.905 --> 58:14.406
Either the water is too dirty,
or we're too far away.

58:18.745 --> 58:20.746
I’m telling you
that you can't see anything.

58:23.458 --> 58:25.375
What's the point in staying here?

58:25.460 --> 58:27.961
We're not supposed
to discover the body.

58:38.097 --> 58:41.266
- Close the window. It’s freezing.
- Shut up. It stinks in here.

58:44.521 --> 58:46.438
Good news.
The principal didncome back.

58:46.523 --> 58:47.689
He's in heat.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.399
He's already got two chicks.
isn’t that enough?

58:49.484 --> 58:51.860
Of course not.
When I grow up, I’ll have a lot.

58:51.945 --> 58:54.321
Look at Napoleon and Louis XIV.

58:54.405 --> 58:56.365
All the big men used to
have a lot of chicks.

58:56.449 --> 58:59.701
- Do you think you're Napoleon?
- I’m Falcon Eye.

59:03.706 --> 59:06.124
M. Moinet, stop playing the fool.

59:06.209 --> 59:08.043
I’m not a fool. I am an Indian.

59:08.127 --> 59:10.045
Very well, you'll write 20 times:

59:10.129 --> 59:13.298
"l provoke my comrades' frivolity
with my absurd comments."

59:19.138 --> 59:23.141
What do I hear?
The principal is missing?

59:23.226 --> 59:25.394
This is the third time, dear friend,

59:25.478 --> 59:27.521
that I drink my wine,
chemically pure.

59:27.605 --> 59:30.148
- Where is he?
- Well...

59:30.233 --> 59:32.442
l saw him the day before
yesterday around 8:00.

59:32.527 --> 59:35.404
By 1 2:00, he was already gone.

59:35.488 --> 59:38.240
And he didn't show up again?

59:38.324 --> 59:40.075
Strange.

59:40.159 --> 59:42.286
That's not like him.

59:43.037 --> 59:47.040
Poor Mme. Delassalle.
She has enough troubles already.

59:47.709 --> 59:50.919
lf she's no more worried than I am,
he can stay where he is.

59:51.004 --> 59:54.006
But believe me,
he'll be back soon.

59:54.090 --> 59:57.426
- And we'll go back to drinking bad wine.
- You said it.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:18.256
Did you notice?

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.218
This afternoon it seemed that
he pretended not to see the body.

01:01:21.302 --> 01:01:22.969
The body was at the bottom.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.972
- Do you think it will rise?
- It has to.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:30.018
- When?
- How should I know?

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.895
Tonight. Tomorrow morning.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.647
I can't wait that long.

01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:38.443
We cannot ask to empty the pool.
Try to understand.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.071
It’s natural to empty a pool
when the water is dirty.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.490
What we find inside
won't be natural at all.

01:01:43.574 --> 01:01:45.492
And if I took responsibility for it?

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:47.869
To take responsibilities,
you must be an adult.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.621
You think like a child.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:55.460
Not worth more than an F!

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:00.716
I don't know how you can
grade papers now.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.884
By mistake I just wrote
complete nonsense.

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:04.678
Well, erase it.

01:02:04.762 --> 01:02:06.430
I don't have an eraser.

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:08.807
Here.

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:14.062
Listen.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:18.608
lf his body doesn't come up by tomorrow,
I’ll manage to have the pool emptied.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.360
And I hope we won't regret it.

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.828
Don't bite your nails.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:38.378
I was offside? Which team are you on?

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:47.095
- Look!
- I was waiting for that.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.347
Don't call attention to it.

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.147
I told you not to look.

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:59.399
Do something!
My heart is about to explode.

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:01.318
You promised yesterday.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.112
Give me the keys.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.698
Let's move things along.

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:12.579
Now we can't play after lunch.

01:03:12.663 --> 01:03:16.124
That was clever.
Go and bring the pole.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:17.834
Me! Me! Me!

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.385
Soudieu!

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.013
Let's test you on a 1 00 meters.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:37.020
As for you, you need
some training in the shot put.

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:40.065
You're lucky.
You have a champion skin diver here.

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:43.652
- Soudieu! I forbid you!
- Let him! He's a champion!

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.666
- What's happening?
- It’s taking him too long.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:00.460
- He might be drowning.
- Did you see the bubbles?

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:05.131
Did you get them?
Say something!

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:08.677
- I saw this shining in the mud.
- It looks like M. Delassalle's lighter.

01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:10.804
- And you didn't see -
- The keys!

01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:12.973
It’s chocolate soup at the bottom.

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:16.309
Go get dressed. Don't catch cold.
We'll manage.

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:25.360
I think we'll have to empty the pool.

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:30.115
Yes. Have it emptied.

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:34.578
Send Plantiveau over.

01:04:35.746 --> 01:04:38.415
You heard the bell.
What are you waiting for?

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:55.098
Go on.

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:56.349
Plantiveau...

01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:07.527
It’s deep right here.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.404
It’s all right. I can swim.

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:12.449
So what? A lot of people
who can swim drown.

01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:15.243
Because the ones who can't
stay away from the edge.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.829
I want you to empty the pool.

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:20.040
Right now?

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:23.126
I’m not dressed for it.
I was going to the barber.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.673
Do it now, Plantiveau.
It’s urgent. Do it for me.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.593
All right. The fish will wait.

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:34.012
Only to empty the pool
will take an hour.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.435
Madame Delassalle.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:49.945
She's upset. Be cool.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:28.400
Why are you staring at me?
What's the matter?

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.696
Let's resume.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.447
The surface of a hexagon...

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.075
in relation to the radius
of the circumference?

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:43.081
Well, I'm waiting.

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.420
I’m waiting...

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:53.633
6 AB x 1/2 OH.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:56.261
Thank you. Good.
Go back to your seat.

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.348
Take out your notebooks.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.147
Wait a minute. I’ll be right back.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.087
M. Plantiveau!

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.758
What happened to her?

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:40.680
It can't be true.
It’s impossible!

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.223
I didnsee well!

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.392
You saw very well!

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:47.562
- He isn't there anymore?
- No, he isn't.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:51.775
Come in.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:54.027
- What is it?
- It’s the doctor, mademoiselle.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:08:00.408
I think it comes from
the open space, the empty pool.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:04.329
She suffers from agoraphobia,
and she got dizzy.

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:07.791
- It’s possible.
- Nature abhors a vacuum.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:12.670
An empty pool isn't worth
a full bottle, Plantiveau.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.011
Is she feeling any better,
dear colleague?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.263
Dr. Loisy is with her.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.974
You'll take her pupils
for study hall, M. Raymond...

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:28.895
and you, M. Drain,
watch my class for a few minutes.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.147
Madame Delassalle
might still need me.

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.066
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:36.027
Did you notice?
She gives the orders now.

01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:41.407
Well, Doctor?

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:45.161
We’ll all get there one day.
When it's worn down, it just is.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.996
Where is the husband?
- Good question.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.915
He needs to hurry back.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:52.794
In the meantime,
no emotions, no vexations.

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:54.796
Spare her.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.881
Don't you think a specialist...

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.425
If you want, I’ll call Bridoux.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:01.970
He's 60 years old,
but he's got the best ear in Paris.

01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:04.639
And he's the finest gourmet!
For him a meal is a meal.

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:08.643
Anyway, give her some digitalis.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:27.495
- The doctor said...
- I don't care. Close the shutters and go.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.582
No. That would be too easy.
Much too easy.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.296
Does a corpse that disappears
seem natural to you?

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.006
Not to me.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:40.300
if he's not in the pool,
someone took him out.

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:43.178
I asked Plantiveau if he opened the door
for anyone. He said no one.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:46.264
- Why would he lie?
- I didn't say he did!

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.350
if no one went out,

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.519
the body should be around here.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.563
I’ve searched everywhere.

01:09:53.647 --> 01:09:56.357
The attic, the basements,
the garden. There's nothing.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.569
No fresh dirt, no footsteps. Nothing!

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:03.823
My head is about to explode.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.366
This is just insane.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.368
It’s been insane since the beginning.

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.662
Actually, it's a kids' game.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:11.706
You took one of your word problems

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:13.291
with leaking taps,

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.793
and tanks that fill up and empty

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:17.545
and you planned a murder from it.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.714
In real Life,
this kind of thing does not exist.

01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:21.925
Taps that you open
while closing another.

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:25.053
Bathtubs that fill up,
and swimming pools that empty.

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:28.473
That's insane.
And I was insane to listen to you.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:31.142
Come in!

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:40.235
Monsieur's suit has been delivered.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:42.445
The one he's been wearing lately.

01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:45.615
- The Prince of Wales.
- Who brought it back?

01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:48.159
- The dry-cleaner.
- What dry-cleaner?

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:51.704
I don't know.
He came on a bicycle.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.248
He looked at the street name

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.541
and asked again
if it was the right address.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:58.544
A very conscientious Little guy.
- Get to the point.

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:03.174
He said it was from M. Delassalle.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:06.970
So I asked him,
"Did you see M. Delassalle? Where?"

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:09.555
So he said, "I didnsee him."

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.642
But he asked me to bring
the suit home, urgently.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:19.065
Well, should I hang it up
in the closet?

01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:21.526
No. Leave it here.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.628
It is his suit.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.589
That's completely insane!

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:45.633
Wait.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.305
Rue St. Ferdinand.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.816
- Good morning.
- Excuse me.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:05.069
Did you deliver a suit
this morning in St. Cloud?

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:07.488
- What's the name?
- Mme. Delassalle.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.532
Was there a problem?

01:12:09.616 --> 01:12:13.619
No. We just want to know who brought
this suit to you, a Prince of Wales.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:15.705
We see so many of them!

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.505
Yes, I do remember.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.632
It was a tall thin man, dark hair...

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:29.093
with a bamboo cigarette holder.

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.554
Wait, there's a check mark.

01:12:31.638 --> 01:12:34.640
The kid forgot something this morning.

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:38.603
This was in his pocket.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.440
Eden Hotel.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.734
Room nine.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:48.363
Well, your husband seems
to be leading some life!

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:51.824
I can have the kid bring
the key, if you wish.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.576
Do you know this hotel, madam?

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:56.913
It’s a residential hotel.
Very fancy.

01:12:56.997 --> 01:12:57.955
Come on!

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:03.127
First street on the right.
Number 27.

01:13:10.594 --> 01:13:12.512
- I’ll go.
- What if they ask you something?

01:13:12.596 --> 01:13:14.389
It looks like they don't
ask questions here.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:17.725
Don't go, it's a trap.
Someone wants to blackmail us.

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.977
At least we'll know
who we're dealing with.

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:34.510
What are you doing here?

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:37.638
I’m looking for M. Delassalle.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.641
He's never here during the day.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.769
When does he come back?

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:45.480
Who knows if he comes back at all.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:47.982
His bed is always neat.

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:53.196
See, no belongings, no bags.

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:55.615
Nothing.

01:14:55.699 --> 01:14:57.533
He's a strange customer.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:06.709
- Have you ever seen him?
- Never, neither has the night watchman.

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:10.171
He must come after I leave and
before the other guy starts his shift.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.298
But, why all these questions?

01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:16.219
He's my husband.
I am Mme. Delassalle.

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:17.970
Poor lady!

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:21.724
This isn't where
you should look for him.

01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:25.311
You can trust me.
His Life is somewhere else.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:34.862
It’s scary.
What's happening to us?

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:37.532
I don't know.
No one knows.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.283
It doesn't make any sense.

01:15:40.452 --> 01:15:43.371
80,000 francs. Shower repair.

01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:44.956
It’s from two years ago.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.500
This time, the marshal
could come for us.

01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:50.711
Pay them half.
It’s already something.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.176
He was really dead, wasn't he?

01:15:58.136 --> 01:16:00.221
You should know.

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:02.139
Why do you say that?

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.058
Because...

01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:06.394
you killed him.
- Me?

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:10.398
Look, you're the one
who planned the whole thing.

01:16:10.482 --> 01:16:13.359
I’m sorry, we planned it...

01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:15.611
and you made the phone call.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.323
You bought the tablecloth to wrap him,
the drug to put him to sleep.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.243
I could never have done that.
- You managed to make him drink.

01:16:22.327 --> 01:16:25.538
You liar! I didn't want to!
You know I didn't want to!

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:29.292
You could've let him sleep his whiskey off
instead of carrying him to the tub.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:32.587
Who filled the tub?
Who pushed him underwater?

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:34.839
And who brought the statue
from the mantel?

01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:37.842
It’s too easy.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:41.012
You’ll see who the court
will hold responsible.

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.306
You'll see.
- The court doesn't scare me.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.308
We’ll get what we deserve.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:48.394
Well, suit yourself!
Go to the police! Go!

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:52.648
- I already thought of that.
- To pin the whole thing on me.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:54.400
I won't let that happen.

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:56.652
I’ll call the cops first!

01:16:57.988 --> 01:16:59.447
Go ahead.

01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:02.366
But I’m warning you,
I’ll tell them everything.

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:06.329
I have nothing to hide.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:08.873
You were jealous, and killed him.

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.958
And I helped you
because I felt pity for you.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:12.877
You were the jealous one

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.129
because it was over
between you two.

01:17:15.213 --> 01:17:17.715
You killed him,
and you know it!

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.136
Well,

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.056
what are you waiting for?

01:17:49.289 --> 01:17:51.123
- Do you have my newspapers?
- Yes.

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:55.086
Be careful not to get dirty.
The ink is still wet.

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:02.885
Christina!

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.097
I have nothing to say to you.

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:09.809
- Where are you going?
- To confession. Do you mind?

01:18:09.893 --> 01:18:12.728
Do you think you'll get absolution
if you don't turn yourself in?

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.230
So I’ll turn myself in.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.942
- What about me?
- I can't keep this up.

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.364
Come on, don't worry.
It’s all over.

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:25.241
They found the body.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.119
Here. Read this.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:32.123
A NAKED CORPSE IN THE SEINE

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:34.875
- Why in the Seine?
- Good question.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.711
What counts is that they found him.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.295
Everything fits.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.841
The description, the Bois de Boulogne
bridge which is very close,

01:18:41.925 --> 01:18:43.843
a three-day-old death.

01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:46.303
Our alibi is holding up.

01:18:47.597 --> 01:18:49.432
They brought him to the morgue.

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:06.949
Excuse me, sir.

01:19:07.033 --> 01:19:10.494
l read this,
and I think it's my husband.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.246
identity card.

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:21.505
Could you describe
M. Delassalle?

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:26.761
Dark hair, thin, dark eyes.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:30.139
All this has already been written
in the paper. It’s too easy.

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:32.349
Give me specific details.

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:34.643
What do you want to know?

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:37.021
I don't know. You tell me.

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:39.982
if you tell me he had
an appendectomy, that's a detail.

01:19:40.817 --> 01:19:42.568
He's had the operation.

01:19:42.652 --> 01:19:46.071
- Okay, dental. How many teeth?
- All of them, I think.

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.656
Any fillings?

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:51.494
- Maybe one or two.
- One or two?

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:52.828
Two.

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.997
- Beauty marks?
- Yes.

01:19:55.081 --> 01:19:56.916
- Where?
- On his shoulder.

01:19:57.584 --> 01:20:00.211
Why didn't you tell me
he had a bracelet?

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:03.547
- He never had one.
- Really?

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:08.010
What do you see on his right thigh?

01:20:08.094 --> 01:20:09.178
Nothing.

01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:11.347
Try to think, above the knee.

01:20:11.431 --> 01:20:15.893
I can't see anything.
So it must be a mistake.

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:22.107
Bring up number 4702.

01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:27.738
You were right. No bracelet
and nothing above the knee.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:58.996
Please, follow me
to the identification room.

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:46.210
- It’s not him.
- Are you sure?

01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:47.753
Yes.

01:22:47.837 --> 01:22:50.339
I’m sorry, madame.
This rarely happens.

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:15.197
Taxi!

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:19.785
- To St. Cloud!
- St. Cloud? Now?

01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.328
Are you out of your mind?

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.914
I don't want to have supper
on a merry-go-round!

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.124
Excuse me.

01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:34.258
Here we go!

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:36.719
Aren't you feeling well, lady?

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:38.470
There's a bit of a shock afterward.

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:40.472
It takes the legs out from under you.

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:42.349
Come, get in.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.436
You should feel better
since it's not him.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.604
Drive.

01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:56.989
Do you feel better?

01:23:57.782 --> 01:23:59.450
Let me introduce myself.

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:02.202
Alfred Fichet,
retired police commissioner.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:05.205
But I didn't ask the police
for anything!

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:08.500
Didn't you inform
the police commissioner?

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:12.629
It was a mistake.
That's what they are for.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:16.383
I didnthink about it.
I’ll do it.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:20.471
I’ll do it myself.
Just out of principle.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:23.891
One should not expect too much
from the regular police.

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:26.185
The police are too busy.

01:24:26.269 --> 01:24:30.647
No. if you'd like, we are both
going to find your husband.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.734
40 years on the job,
it's not to be ignored.

01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:35.694
Now, I have plenty of time.

01:24:36.362 --> 01:24:40.240
- No. Really, it's not necessary.
- What do you risk?

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:43.243
lf I don't find anything,
you won't pay me anything.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:47.289
And if I do find something,
well, you’ll judge for yourself.

01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:49.333
You can't ask for a better deal.

01:24:50.001 --> 01:24:53.462
Let's see.
You've been married for how Long?

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.048
Eight years.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:57.800
I don't understand what -

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:01.011
Leave it to me. I’m used to this.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.597
We said, eight years.

01:25:07.727 --> 01:25:09.520
It’s boiling, mademoiselle.

01:25:10.313 --> 01:25:13.107
- How long do you think it can boil?
- Five minutes.

01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:44.346
How do I know?
He had his own keys.

01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:47.432
He would go in, and out.
He was the boss.

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.226
And it was vacation anyway.

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:58.110
- Was he a little low-spirited?
- It was not his style.

01:25:58.194 --> 01:26:00.445
It was more in his nature
to complicate his life.

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.448
- Maybe he was feeling sick.
- Are you joking?

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:06.410
The man was very strong.

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.662
When he was younger,
he was a tennis champion.

01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:12.457
Did he get a telegram on Sunday?

01:26:13.084 --> 01:26:14.585
A phone call?

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:17.296
Sometimes,
people leave after a phone call.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:21.758
I can't tell you, sir. On Sunday,
I took my wife to the park.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.261
When the school is closed,
we seize the opportunity.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:26.889
There could have been an accident.

01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:31.185
How does M. Delassalle drive?
Fast, very fast?

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.979
He didn't have the car.
The ladies took it to Niort.

01:26:34.063 --> 01:26:35.689
That's right.

01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:37.816
Don't you think
he could've drowned?

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:40.235
Drowned?

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.987
He was a real fish.

01:26:42.071 --> 01:26:44.573
This man could swim.

01:26:45.241 --> 01:26:47.242
I see.

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:48.994
Well, thank you.

01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:55.083
The Alps separate Italy
from France in the southeast.

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:58.545
The Alps are very high mountains.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:02.841
There is Mont-Blanc,
the highest mountain in Europe.

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:05.219
In the east, there is the Jura...

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:08.055
That is quite reassuring.

01:27:08.139 --> 01:27:11.099
I think you worried
a little bit too early.

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:13.810
On Saturday,
your husband was still here.

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:16.396
It’s only been five days,

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:18.565
and you go look for him
at the morgue.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.817
The article in the paper upset me.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:24.196
A 30-year-old man,
one meter seventy...

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:29.743
Dear madame, there are 1 00,000 men
in Paris who fit this description.

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:32.412
And that's not including the tourists.

01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:36.917
I guess you were thinking of suicide.

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:39.336
Yes. Well, I don't know.

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:43.090
To commit suicide in the Seine,
one doesn't need to undress.

01:27:43.174 --> 01:27:48.887
My hypothesis is much less tragic.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:51.390
When I say hypothesis, I mean...

01:27:51.474 --> 01:27:52.933
A woman!

01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:55.560
Of course, you're right.

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:57.980
I was stupid to worry
and to bother you.

01:27:58.064 --> 01:27:59.731
Take this.
- No, no.

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.733
I won't steal your money.

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:03.443
Remember our agreement.

01:28:03.528 --> 01:28:06.363
if I don't find anything,
you don't owe me anything.

01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:09.533
But, don't worry, I’ll find him.

01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:17.666
I haven't been
in a school for a long time.

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:21.420
In my days, it was the local school.
Charonne.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.840
Less fancy. Much less fancy.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:28.385
Ah, it was really different.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:37.602
You emptied the pool.

01:28:38.604 --> 01:28:41.106
You thought about this too.

01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:44.192
- Not at all!
- Why not at all?

01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:47.404
I dropped my keys in the pool.
So in order to get them back -

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:49.906
- When was that?
- Yesterday morning.

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:52.200
Commissioner Fichet.

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:55.287
Mlle. Horner,
our most devoted associate.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:57.831
Delighted, miss.

01:28:57.915 --> 01:29:01.418
It was pure coincidence.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.965
Really, the keys in the pool,
the husband in the morgue.

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:10.052
You dream too much
about water in this house!

01:29:10.928 --> 01:29:15.015
May I look at his mail?
- You'll never find him.

01:29:15.099 --> 01:29:17.225
How do you know anyway?

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.773
- I see he has a typewriter.
- Yes, for the accounts.

01:29:25.943 --> 01:29:29.029
You're right. M. Delassalle
is not a literary man.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.408
Perhaps he doesn't trust his spelling.

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:38.580
May I?

01:29:40.249 --> 01:29:44.002
I really can't imagine him
being suicidal.

01:29:44.087 --> 01:29:46.755
Okay, let's do this methodically.

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:49.591
So we're saying...

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.804
Delassalle, Michel,

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.555
34 years old.

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.809
- Height.
- One meter seventy.

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:01.061
Yes, I know.

01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:03.438
Dark hair.

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:05.273
Eyes?

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:07.776
Brown.

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:11.446
Nose...

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.491
average.

01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:16.910
Ears: folded in.

01:30:16.994 --> 01:30:20.831
How to find someone
with this description?

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.749
Well, we'll find him.

01:30:22.834 --> 01:30:24.876
These detectives are really smart.

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:28.422
What was he wearing
the day he disappeared?

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.926
We were away that day, sir.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:36.763
Of course! How stupid of me.

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:39.433
Here's what we'll do.

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:41.768
We'll look into his wardrobe

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:43.478
and we'll see what is missing.

01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:47.858
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:50.318
Six.

01:30:51.362 --> 01:30:53.697
What did the 7th pair look like?

01:30:54.657 --> 01:30:56.491
Brown suede.

01:30:59.036 --> 01:31:00.662
Tie?

01:31:00.746 --> 01:31:03.206
Red, with a white stripe.

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:07.252
You're sharp-eyed.
He's got at least 25 ties.

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:10.172
So, suit?

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:16.178
Suit!

01:31:18.055 --> 01:31:21.641
So you know his ties
better than his suits.

01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:24.853
I think it's a gray Prince of Wales.

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:29.107
Prince of Wales, gray.

01:31:41.078 --> 01:31:42.120
Like this one?

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.372
Yes.

01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:47.417
Just a moment.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.336
Is something wrong?

01:31:50.421 --> 01:31:53.340
Mme. Delassalle has a heart condition.
We must spare her.

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:57.928
You should have told me.
It’s not that urgent.

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:00.305
I’ve got enough
to keep myself busy.

01:32:00.389 --> 01:32:02.224
Take care of yourself.

01:32:02.975 --> 01:32:05.018
I’ll go visit downtown.

01:32:05.102 --> 01:32:07.437
I still have friends there.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:13.026
And don't worry. I’ll be back.

01:32:17.406 --> 01:32:19.866
Plantiveau said he's a detective.

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:23.036
A private one.
Everybody to the firing squad!

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:28.041
Heberge.

01:32:28.834 --> 01:32:32.837
if you're done with your work,
I’ll find something else for you to do.

01:32:32.922 --> 01:32:35.215
First, Latin.

01:32:35.299 --> 01:32:38.552
When the Middle Ages lost everything,
they still knew Latin.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:43.807
The Church understood it.
The last village priest knew Latin.

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:47.394
I don't think that
the average priest is that clever.

01:32:47.478 --> 01:32:49.688
It’s not his job.

01:32:49.772 --> 01:32:52.691
In spite of that, let me tell you...

01:32:52.775 --> 01:32:54.025
Excuse me.

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:56.319
M. Moinet,
what are you doing here?

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:59.406
Aren't you supposed to be studying?

01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:01.575
- The principal punished me.
- Who?

01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:05.036
- The principal.
- What are you talking about?

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:08.915
- It’s the truth.
- What did you do?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.251
I broke a window.

01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:15.005
- Maybe the principal came back.
- Don't be silly.

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:17.716
I’ve had enough of your stories!

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.426
Tell me the truth, now.

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:21.511
Who punished you?
- The principal.

01:33:23.055 --> 01:33:25.724
- That's for lying!
- I’m not Lying.

01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:28.351
Let me handle this.
You're scaring him.

01:33:29.353 --> 01:33:32.522
Listen, Moinet.
Tell me your story again.

01:33:33.357 --> 01:33:35.650
if you tell everything,
I’ll Lift your punishment.

01:33:35.735 --> 01:33:36.776
Yes, madame.

01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:39.112
- How did you break the window?
- With my slingshot.

01:33:39.196 --> 01:33:40.822
Then what happened?

01:33:40.906 --> 01:33:44.034
The principal opened the door
and told me to go to bed right away...

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:46.786
without picking up the dead leaves.

01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:49.122
It can't be him.
It’s impossible.

01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:51.416
You know he's not here.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.044
You forget that this kid
is a pathological liar.

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:57.589
Last week, he told his friends
he had a fight with a lion at the fair.

01:33:57.673 --> 01:33:59.132
With a lion!

01:33:59.216 --> 01:34:00.592
He's a mythomaniac.

01:34:00.676 --> 01:34:03.261
I just asked the other kids.
Nobody saw the principal.

01:34:03.346 --> 01:34:06.806
However, there really is
a broken window in the corridor.

01:34:06.891 --> 01:34:09.434
I doubt he punished himself
and made up this story.

01:34:09.518 --> 01:34:13.980
Who knows? Obviously, this is a case
of self-induced hallucination.

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:15.732
The kid broke a window

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:18.985
and in his subconscious,
he generated the idea of punishment

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:21.071
to match the principal's.

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:22.656
Darkness did the rest.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.199
Do you really think so?

01:34:24.283 --> 01:34:27.702
The kid saw himself being punished
in the Literal sense of the word.

01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:30.121
I think he's messing with us

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:32.248
in the literal sense of the word.

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:36.586
- Give me your slingshot.
- The principal took it.

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:42.092
Young Moinet, don't you think
you're going a little too far?

01:34:44.136 --> 01:34:47.180
I feel tired.
I’m going to sleep.

01:34:47.264 --> 01:34:49.599
But of course, madame.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:51.059
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:34:51.143 --> 01:34:55.105
Go get some rest.
We'll handle this matter.

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.649
M. Moinet.

01:34:57.733 --> 01:35:00.026
We've been patient enough.

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:03.488
if you want to be stubborn,
go straight to the corner.

01:35:03.572 --> 01:35:06.950
You'll get out
only after you tell the truth.

01:35:07.785 --> 01:35:10.829
We’ll see who gets tired first.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.707
I saw him.

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:15.291
I know I saw him.

01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:23.466
This slingshot...

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.970
Moinet couldn't have brought it here.

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.555
Certainly not.

01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:29.639
Who was it?

01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:33.226
I don't know.
It could be anyone.

01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:36.312
- By coincidence?
- Yes, by coincidence.

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:39.983
And Fichet was at the morgue
by coincidence.

01:35:40.818 --> 01:35:45.155
And the suit, and the hotel,
and now the students.

01:35:45.948 --> 01:35:48.241
Is it a coincidence that
it's getting closer each time?

01:35:48.325 --> 01:35:51.911
Please, calm down.
My nerves aren't made of steel either.

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:55.373
It’s all getting clear.
There are no miracles in life.

01:35:55.458 --> 01:35:56.499
Unfortunately.

01:35:57.168 --> 01:35:59.419
Each time I close my eyes...

01:35:59.503 --> 01:36:01.171
it seems that I’m going to see him.

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:02.630
Stop talking!

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:05.049
He must not be a pretty sight.

01:36:05.134 --> 01:36:09.012
Yes, if he's dead.

01:36:10.097 --> 01:36:13.308
Listen, Christina.
I’ve seen dead people in my life.

01:36:13.392 --> 01:36:15.935
Believe me, Michel is dead.
Really dead.

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.854
Lie down and try not
to think of anything.

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:20.398
With all I have on my mind...

01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:22.901
lf you don't get any sleep,
you won't last three days.

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.528
Dr. Loisy is very worried.

01:36:26.697 --> 01:36:29.365
He asked Prof. Bridoux
to come tomorrow.

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.535
There you are.

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:37.165
What's the point?
I’m finished now.

01:36:40.586 --> 01:36:42.962
- Stop that.
- Give me back my marbles.

01:36:43.047 --> 01:36:44.881
- I don't have them.
- You took them, I know.

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:46.800
- I’m going to break your neck!
- Leave me alone!

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:48.635
- Give him back his marbles.
- Leave me alone.

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:50.637
I haven't got them. Stop it!

01:36:50.721 --> 01:36:53.014
Come on, come on!

01:36:53.098 --> 01:36:55.975
You can fight if you want,
but don't scream.

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.645
Mme. Delassalle is very sick.

01:36:58.729 --> 01:37:00.688
Go on.

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:07.529
Moinet,

01:37:07.613 --> 01:37:09.864
your punishment is Lifted...

01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:11.783
for now.

01:37:11.867 --> 01:37:14.536
Go for your picture.
- Thank you, sir.

01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:31.678
A picture without the principals
is not a school picture.

01:37:31.762 --> 01:37:34.472
We'll do better next year.
Come on, children.

01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:39.519
Should we put the bench
in front of the window?

01:37:39.603 --> 01:37:41.813
- Why not in front of the door?
- What about the car?

01:37:41.897 --> 01:37:45.066
There is a professor
from the university upstairs.

01:37:45.943 --> 01:37:48.027
I must go. It’s part of the job.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:51.114
I’ll show the professor out,
and I’ll call you.

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:01.875
You overdid it.

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:05.336
You should really have a good rest.

01:38:05.421 --> 01:38:08.756
- Will I be able to get up?
- We'll talk about this later.

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:10.550
You will be fine here.

01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:13.803
Could I go out into the yard?
Is that too much for me?

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:15.680
Until the doctors say so,

01:38:15.764 --> 01:38:18.600
moving about is strictly forbidden.

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:21.311
Get in position.

01:38:23.188 --> 01:38:25.231
Look at my hand.
Don't move.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:27.775
One, two. Thank you.

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:30.361
One minute.
I’ll take another one.

01:38:38.662 --> 01:38:40.330
You can go through.

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:46.169
Taking her to my clinic
would have been too expensive.

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:47.921
Between you and me,
there are no heirs.

01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:51.507
I know. But people dying in the clinic,
the hearse in front of the door,

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:53.259
I don't like that.

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:55.678
Neither do the patients.

01:38:57.681 --> 01:38:59.682
Let me see!

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:03.561
Be careful, kids.
It’s still wet.

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:07.273
Great. Nobody moved.

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:09.943
Please. I came out fine.

01:39:10.027 --> 01:39:12.445
This is the first time
I’ve had the position of honor.

01:39:12.529 --> 01:39:15.531
When I show the picture,
they'll think I'm the principal.

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:17.825
- What's that behind the window?
- Looks like the boss.

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.620
- You're nuts!
- Wait! Let me put my monocle on.

01:39:20.704 --> 01:39:23.164
- Let me see, mademoiselle!
- Leave me alone!

01:39:26.168 --> 01:39:28.127
I didnsee anything.

01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:31.839
You didn't miss anything.
It’s some kind of shot-silk effect.

01:39:31.924 --> 01:39:34.008
The refection of a cloud
or some spot on the window...

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:35.885
that reminds us of
the principal's features.

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:37.512
Maybe it's him.

01:39:37.596 --> 01:39:39.806
He didn't want to interrupt us

01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:43.643
or this was just an innocent joke.

01:39:43.727 --> 01:39:45.728
I can't see Delassalle
playing hide-and-seek.

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:49.607
But you were facing us.
Didn't you see anything?

01:39:49.692 --> 01:39:52.527
I was looking at the group,
being sure to see everybody.

01:39:52.611 --> 01:39:54.320
Let's settle this once and for all.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:55.822
Moinet.

01:39:58.075 --> 01:40:01.661
You're such a great observer.
Did you see the principal?

01:40:01.745 --> 01:40:04.747
No thanks. I’ve had enough
with six hours in the corner.

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:07.000
The case is closed.
There wasn't anyone.

01:40:07.084 --> 01:40:08.751
Thankfully. Really.

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.421
To hear that people come and go
without my knowing it

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.256
is offensive for a watchman.

01:40:20.597 --> 01:40:23.266
- I'm afraid.
- Me too.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.394
We must go now.

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:31.691
Here, get dressed!

01:40:31.775 --> 01:40:34.360
The doctors forbid me to move.

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:37.447
Where would we go, anyway?

01:40:38.907 --> 01:40:40.575
To my place.

01:40:41.243 --> 01:40:42.869
In Niort?

01:40:42.953 --> 01:40:44.871
Don't you think
he might be there as well?

01:40:44.955 --> 01:40:47.206
He's more certainly there,
than anywhere else.

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:49.959
So we'll travel.
We'll go anywhere.

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:53.546
It’s not possible.
There's no point.

01:40:54.423 --> 01:40:57.467
- I can't stay here anymore.
- So just go.

01:40:58.469 --> 01:41:00.887
What about you?
I can't leave you here.

01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:02.597
Yes. You'll see.

01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:04.849
You'll get used to managing without me.

01:41:05.517 --> 01:41:07.935
Besides, I don't want
to see you anymore.

01:41:08.645 --> 01:41:10.646
For all that's about to happen...

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:14.192
for all that will eventually happen...

01:41:14.276 --> 01:41:16.110
I’d rather be on my own.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.989
No, no, please!

01:41:27.706 --> 01:41:29.207
You hate me, don't you?

01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:32.376
Not at all.

01:41:42.846 --> 01:41:45.306
Where is the little red
suitcase I gave you?

01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:49.310
On the floor, by the closet.

01:41:56.068 --> 01:41:59.529
So you really think it's time
for us to separate?

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:02.240
Yes, it'll be better that way.

01:42:02.324 --> 01:42:04.784
I hope you succeed and forget.

01:42:04.868 --> 01:42:05.910
Farewell, Christina.

01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:21.425
"Tremble, she told me,
a girl worthy of me.

01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:24.554
The cruel God of the Jews
is stronger than you.

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:27.223
I pity you for falling
in his fearsome hands."

01:42:56.628 --> 01:42:58.754
What are you doing here?

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:00.590
I was just looking at you.

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:10.099
I came to make my report.
That's what I’m paid for.

01:43:10.934 --> 01:43:13.936
But you were sleeping so deeply...

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.771
Leave me alone.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:17.940
I’m sick, very sick.

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:20.359
You'll feel better very soon.

01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:24.280
Everything is fine.

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:28.534
Can't you have some pity for me
and let me croak in peace?

01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:30.286
Do you think I’m not dying
fast enough?

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.747
What's the matter with you?

01:43:32.831 --> 01:43:35.082
It’s not the time to die.

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:37.293
I found him.

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:39.045
He'll be here very shortly.

01:43:39.129 --> 01:43:41.589
It’s wrong, and you know it.

01:43:41.673 --> 01:43:43.841
- You know he can't come back.
- Why?

01:43:43.926 --> 01:43:45.593
Because I killed him.

01:43:47.596 --> 01:43:49.055
This afternoon?

01:43:49.139 --> 01:43:51.390
Five days ago.

01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:52.475
Five...

01:43:53.769 --> 01:43:55.770
So we mustn't be talking
about the same one.

01:43:55.854 --> 01:43:57.730
Five days ago in Niort.

01:43:57.814 --> 01:43:59.523
And you went to the morgue?

01:43:59.608 --> 01:44:01.234
His body disappeared.

01:44:01.318 --> 01:44:03.736
- From Niort?
- No, from here!

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.947
We brought him back in the truck

01:44:06.031 --> 01:44:07.949
in a wicker trunk.

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:10.910
When we got here,
we threw him in the swimming pool.

01:44:10.994 --> 01:44:12.161
Yes, yes.

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:16.916
But you weren't alone in Niort.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.168
- You were with mademoiselle...
- Horner.

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:21.254
Horner, yes.

01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:23.547
And didn't she notice anything?

01:44:23.632 --> 01:44:26.175
She was his mistress.

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:27.802
She helped me.

01:44:27.886 --> 01:44:30.346
I see.

01:44:31.348 --> 01:44:34.016
She was his mistress
and she helped you.

01:44:35.602 --> 01:44:37.270
Well...

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:44.318
l wouldn't mind hearing
what she's got to say.

01:44:45.028 --> 01:44:47.655
She got scared, and she left.

01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:49.699
I kind of figured that.

01:44:55.497 --> 01:44:58.124
It won't work. It’s Michel's.

01:44:58.208 --> 01:45:01.043
It was underwater a whole day.

01:45:07.426 --> 01:45:09.218
Well, well...

01:45:13.098 --> 01:45:15.057
Aren't you charging me?

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:21.230
You should stop charging your nerves.

01:45:22.399 --> 01:45:24.900
You need a strong sedative.

01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:28.237
Good night.

01:45:31.575 --> 01:45:33.242
Let me turn the light off.

01:45:36.788 --> 01:45:39.457
Tomorrow morning,
you’ll wake up acquitted.

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.966
He's disappeared. She's cracked up.

01:45:49.051 --> 01:45:51.093
On top of that, Nicole runs away.

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:53.804
What do you think it means?
- Better sign up for unemployment.

01:45:53.889 --> 01:45:55.306
I’m afraid so.

01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:56.766
Here's the cop.

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:59.685
I found it under the diving board.

01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:08.194
- isn’t there a wicker trunk around here?
- Yes, sir.

01:46:08.278 --> 01:46:10.112
Above the garage.

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.782
Above the garage?

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:15.534
Well, let's go.

01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:21.540
It’s starting to stink.

01:46:21.625 --> 01:46:25.544
You wonder if anything
happened to Delassalle.

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:27.421
You're a witness
that I didn't know anything.

01:46:27.506 --> 01:46:29.507
Me either, dear colleague.

01:46:29.591 --> 01:46:31.258
Right. Let him manage alone.

01:46:58.745 --> 01:47:02.415
- I don't know why, but...
- You think we screwed up.

01:47:02.499 --> 01:47:03.999
Me too.

01:47:25.313 --> 01:47:26.814
M. Pacard.

01:47:28.483 --> 01:47:29.650
Moinet.

01:47:34.656 --> 01:47:36.991
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

01:49:53.670 --> 01:49:55.004
Who's there?

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:55.220
Is it over?

01:54:58.933 --> 01:55:00.601
She was tough.

01:55:01.269 --> 01:55:02.895
The bitch.

01:55:02.979 --> 01:55:05.230
She used to say that
she had a weak heart.

01:55:05.899 --> 01:55:08.901
My poor darling. You're all wet.
Go change your clothes.

01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:12.195
In the bathroom,

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:15.782
it took me more than an hour to get
out of the tub without making noise.

01:55:15.867 --> 01:55:18.869
You must've suffered
during the trip in the trunk.

01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:26.084
What about the dive in the pool
in the middle of the night?

01:55:27.337 --> 01:55:28.962
She put us through a lot.

01:55:29.047 --> 01:55:30.714
I got scared more than four times.

01:55:30.798 --> 01:55:32.591
Wasn't it worth it?

01:55:32.675 --> 01:55:34.676
Now, we're rich.

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:36.595
Just by selling the school,
we'll get a lot.

01:55:36.679 --> 01:55:39.181
Between 1 5 and 20 years in jail.

01:55:40.475 --> 01:55:42.184
it’ll depend on the judge.

01:55:51.819 --> 01:55:52.694
Moinet!

01:55:53.696 --> 01:55:55.072
Moinet!

01:55:55.156 --> 01:55:56.865
Wait a moment.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.163
You again, Moinet.

01:56:03.247 --> 01:56:04.748
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:56:04.832 --> 01:56:07.668
On the day we're closing the school.

01:56:08.544 --> 01:56:11.421
- Who gave you this slingshot?
- Mme. Delassalle.

01:56:11.506 --> 01:56:13.966
- Who?
- Mme. Delassalle.

01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:17.135
She opened her door.
She gave me back my slingshot.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.680
She said, "This is for you, Moinet.
Have fun."

01:56:20.598 --> 01:56:23.475
You're impossible.

01:56:23.559 --> 01:56:28.230
You know that she's dead.
Her body was taken away today.

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:30.399
She's not dead. She came back.

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:33.902
M. Moinet, go to the corner.

01:56:38.408 --> 01:56:39.866
I saw her.

01:56:39.951 --> 01:56:41.618
I know I saw her.

01:56:55.758 --> 01:56:57.384
Don't be devils!

01:56:57.468 --> 01:57:02.014
Don't ruin the interest
your friends could take in this film.

01:57:02.098 --> 01:57:05.350
Don't tell them what you saw.

01:57:05.435 --> 01:57:08.270
Thank you for them.
