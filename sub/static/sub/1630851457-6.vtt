00:25.541 --> 00:28.916
Hmm. Okay, all done, T0-B1.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.291
Good morning!

00:47.375 --> 00:51.041
Professor Mitaka,
did you make me bigger again?

00:51.125 --> 00:54.000
Next up is C03.
Would you go get him, please?

00:54.583 --> 00:55.583
Okay!

00:56.958 --> 00:58.250
Good morning!

00:58.833 --> 01:00.166
Gotta find C03!

01:00.750 --> 01:02.666
Hold on, where did C03 go?

01:10.958 --> 01:15.500
Hey! There you are, C03!

01:20.666 --> 01:22.541
It's your turn for a tune-up.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.166
Then we can play Jedi afterwards!

01:29.291 --> 01:30.416
T0-B1!

01:30.500 --> 01:32.708
-How many times must I tell you?

01:32.791 --> 01:34.750
You must never go into the basement.

01:34.833 --> 01:35.791
Sorry!

01:35.875 --> 01:36.875
Hmm.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.500
Come along, my children.

01:39.583 --> 01:40.833
Let's get to work.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.041
Professor Mitaka, how long are we going to
keep working on this?

01:56.625 --> 01:58.291
-I'm bored already.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.125
How many times must I tell you?

02:00.208 --> 02:04.291
"Until there are clouds in the sky
and there is green on the land."

02:04.375 --> 02:07.166
We can stop only when there is life
on this planet,

02:07.250 --> 02:10.375
and we are going to make this
a beautiful place.

02:11.416 --> 02:12.750
Can we hurry?

02:12.833 --> 02:15.750
Because I really wanna see the rest
of the galaxy.

02:15.833 --> 02:18.458
Hmm? Listen.
You don't know what it's like.

02:18.541 --> 02:22.208
You're safe here, and things are peaceful,
but the galaxy is--

02:22.291 --> 02:24.833
"…terrifying and full of danger."

02:24.916 --> 02:27.416
Right. So you do know.

02:27.916 --> 02:30.333
-Because I've heard it a million times.
-Hmm?

02:30.916 --> 02:32.791
I've not said it that much.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.541
It's only dangerous
because the Jedi are needed.

02:38.333 --> 02:40.208
Huh? What am I drawing?

02:40.291 --> 02:44.416
Well, obviously it's a Jedi Knight! Hyah!

02:44.500 --> 02:48.583
He's the strong, heroic Jedi Knight T0-B1!

02:58.458 --> 02:59.458
Uh…

03:00.916 --> 03:02.875
T0-B1…

03:04.083 --> 03:05.166
T0-B1…

03:06.000 --> 03:09.416
You were imagining being a Jedi again,
weren't you?

03:11.291 --> 03:12.708
Well, enough of that.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.666
That's because
I want to become a Jedi one day,

03:15.750 --> 03:18.583
traveling the galaxy, defeating evil.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.791
You must first accept reality.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.916
When it comes to the future, you see,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.416
there is the distant
but also the immediate.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.833
Adventure? Excitement?

03:27.916 --> 03:31.708
I'm afraid that being a Jedi is not
as glamorous as it is in your dreams.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.541
It's kind of hard for me to explain,

03:34.625 --> 03:37.333
but I feel like something
is calling out to me.

03:37.416 --> 03:40.666
I keep having these dreams,
and in them I'm a great Jedi.

03:40.750 --> 03:41.958
Hmm.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.416
Then you must
find yourself a kyber crystal.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.458
Hmm? Oh.

03:46.541 --> 03:49.250
There is one somewhere on this planet.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.333
This thing?

03:50.416 --> 03:55.333
The crystal is the core of the lightsaber,
the weapon of a Jedi Knight.

03:57.083 --> 04:00.000
I've heard young Padawans,
the apprentices of Jedi Knights,

04:00.083 --> 04:02.250
must search for their crystal first.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.458
So if you really want to be a Jedi,

04:04.541 --> 04:07.875
you will need to find a kyber crystal
of your own.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.000
Oh.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.375
Hop!

04:19.375 --> 04:21.333
Let's go!

04:24.625 --> 04:26.000
Huh?

04:37.500 --> 04:41.625
If I can't find the kyber crystal,
how am I supposed to become a Jedi?

04:45.208 --> 04:46.791
-Clear your mind.
-Hmm?

04:47.958 --> 04:49.625
And use the Force.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.083
The Force?

04:52.666 --> 04:55.416
Yes. The Force is
what gives a Jedi their power.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.875
So, where do I find the Force then?

04:58.958 --> 05:02.708
Everywhere.
The Force is present in all things.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.375
Nothing.

05:12.958 --> 05:16.166
He keeps telling me to use the Force,
but I don't know anything about it.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.375
But I've already searched everywhere
on this planet.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.583
-Never go into the basement.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.416
-Hmm?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.875
You've got a bad feeling about this?

05:30.958 --> 05:33.666
But this is the only place
that I haven't searched yet.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.375
Okay, I'm just gonna take a peek.

05:39.458 --> 05:41.166
A ship?

05:42.708 --> 05:44.166
So cool!

05:44.958 --> 05:46.666
Oh!

05:47.333 --> 05:50.541
Let's take off!

05:53.041 --> 05:56.125
I'm T0-B1. This is a call to all Jedi.

05:56.208 --> 05:57.750
If you can hear me, report in!

05:59.958 --> 06:02.375
Sir, we've picked up
a suspicious signal.

06:03.541 --> 06:05.125
It could be a survivor, sir.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.791
Jedi.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.375
-What are you doing?

06:11.458 --> 06:14.041
T0-B1! Get out of there right now!

06:14.125 --> 06:17.750
I-I'm sorry. I just thought
there might be a crystal here.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.333
Come here!

06:24.666 --> 06:25.666
Professor Mitaka.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.000
You're a Jedi? I had no idea.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.000
Why didn't you tell me?

06:33.083 --> 06:34.791
In order to protect you.

06:36.708 --> 06:37.541
Hmm.

06:42.541 --> 06:43.875
They're here.

06:43.958 --> 06:46.041
I need you to stay hidden.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.041
-Do not come out for any reason.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.541
So is this the Force?

06:52.625 --> 06:54.625
Please don't deactivate me!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Hmm.

07:02.916 --> 07:05.250
C03, I leave this child to you.

07:06.916 --> 07:10.583
I am one with the Force.
The Force is with me.

07:11.916 --> 07:14.500
Professor Mitaka?

07:30.541 --> 07:32.708
What happened to everyone?

07:33.708 --> 07:35.166
Where's the professor?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.375
No.

07:55.666 --> 07:58.250
I'm gonna do it.
I'll continue the research.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.541
I'll fulfill the professor's dream.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.583
Okay. Here we go.

08:35.541 --> 08:38.833
Clouds? How did that happen?

08:42.250 --> 08:44.291
Could this be life?

08:46.625 --> 08:49.708
It's raining!
It's actually raining!

08:50.750 --> 08:52.458
It really worked.

08:52.541 --> 08:55.000
The professor's dream
has finally come true.

08:56.375 --> 09:00.625
T0-B1. Use the Force.

09:22.791 --> 09:24.208
-Hmm?

09:31.541 --> 09:33.583
A Jedi? I don't think so.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.708
Well, who is it? Do you know?

09:37.583 --> 09:41.250
A Jedi killer?
It's his fault the professor--

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
So, there is another Jedi
on this planet.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.958
Where did you come from?

09:49.041 --> 09:51.708
Did that old, armless Jedi hide you away?

09:59.041 --> 10:01.416
I cannot allow you to become a threat.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.916
Enough!

10:14.625 --> 10:16.125
-Don't be afraid.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.666
Professor!

10:20.666 --> 10:24.416
Do not worry.
You are prepared for this fight, Tobi.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.583
-My young Padawan.

10:28.666 --> 10:31.916
You did well bringing life
back to this planet,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.125
and you have proven
that you have grown up.

10:36.666 --> 10:38.708
By the will of the Force.

10:39.458 --> 10:44.375
Tobi, rise, as a true Jedi.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.291
And may the Force be with you.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.333
Master Mitaka…

11:13.083 --> 11:15.291
Hey, wait, open the valve!

11:23.333 --> 11:24.333
Run!

11:50.541 --> 11:51.583
-Die!

11:54.083 --> 11:56.625
Droid? A droid became a Jedi!

11:56.708 --> 11:59.125
My name is Tobi, and I'm a Jedi!

12:03.208 --> 12:04.791
Useless junk!

12:05.833 --> 12:07.208
Stop it!

12:07.291 --> 12:09.041
C03! Let's go!

12:37.416 --> 12:38.500
All this stuff?

12:39.125 --> 12:43.333
We will continue our research and the
professor's legacy of helping planets.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.833
'Cause that's what Jedi do.
