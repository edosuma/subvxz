11:42.268 --> 11:44.100
You can't report more

11:46.206 --> 11:47.174

After experiencing a decline
drastic, worries

12:26.312 --> 12:29.282
towards economic development
Southeast Asia is getting bigger

12:30.049 --> 12:32.280
Malaysia which is a few years old
back has increased

12:32.285 --> 12:35.153
economy, as well as Thailand,
singapore and other countries

12:36.155 --> 12:38.215
Is experiencing a spread
currency crisis

12:39.292 --> 12:41.261
The chief financial officer said late
week away playing golf

12:45.164 --> 12:49.226
I thought I was told,
here as a responsibility

12:49.235 --> 12:52.262
my currency policy
feel very sorry

12:54.040 --> 12:57.101
Fill in more details
explained by the head of policy

12:57.143 --> 13:00.204
currency of the bank of Korea Han
sihyun who will explain

13:01.180 --> 13:03.240
Starting from Southeast Asia,
the US dollar is doing

13:03.283 --> 13:06.151
fast withdrawal, all of you
already know clearly right

13:07.220 --> 13:10.088
Who is he? He's not a secretary
/ state of affairs

13:10.089 --> 13:12.251
han it doesn't cause motorbikes
bankruptcy

13:13.259 --> 13:15.251
At that time because of lack of handling
good from every finance department

13:16.229 --> 13:19.996
Foreign investors are starting to hesitate
handling our country's crisis

13:20.233 --> 13:24.102
Starting from August foreign capital
pulled back out of korea

13:25.071 --> 13:27.131
The won's value continues to decline

13:27.273 --> 13:29.139
Our country uses
how to improve

13:29.175 --> 13:31.076
country foreign exchange reserves
to defend it

13:32.045 --> 13:33.274
Do defense
like that for

13:33.313 --> 13:35.282
one week requires
costing $ 2 billion dollars

13:37.050 --> 13:39.212
One week $ 2 billion
dollar, it can only

13:39.218 --> 13:42.120
maintain the exchange rate of $ 1
American dollar = 800 won

13:43.022 --> 13:45.082
The market person isn't already
clear with things like this,

13:45.124 --> 13:47.150
things like this do have to be
done like that

13:50.163 --> 13:53.031
Our team started from last year 3-4
november analyzes rollover presentations

13:53.166 --> 13:55.101
That is the cost of extending
deadline

13:55.101 --> 13:57.127
loan repayment
money from a foreign country

13:58.037 --> 14:02.168
At the end of October, presentae
rollover is 86.5  /   

14:03.042 --> 14:07.036
Foreign investors lend money because
to take a prolonging attitude

14:07.180 --> 14:10.150
But on November 3
most investors

14:10.183 --> 14:12.277
foreigners reject everything
submission of extension

14:13.086 --> 14:17.114
Request before December
all investment value is returned

14:19.225 --> 14:22.093
Exactly how much / data
announced by the finance ministry

14:22.128 --> 14:24.222
November 15 foreign exchange reserves
there are as much as $ 15.8 billion

14:25.064 --> 14:27.033
But this data is uncertain

14:28.167 --> 14:33.128
Rollover rejected and
the US dollar pays

14:33.172 --> 14:38.167
at the beginning, become foreign exchange reserves
in $ 9 billion

14:40.079 --> 14:43.208
You are clear, reserve
foreign exchange is less than $ 9 billion dollars

14:44.283 --> 14:47.082
This will affect exports
Korean imports, the government

14:47.120 --> 14:49.214
can't guarantee this
will take place normally

14:51.023 --> 14:54.983
You are clear / government
cannot guarantee export imports

14:57.163 --> 14:58.131
The country will go bankrupt

15:01.234 --> 15:07.265
If my calculation doesn't miss,
another week South Korea will go bankrupt

15:26.292 --> 15:27.191
Is it true

15:31.063 --> 15:35.023
Now the president is not very happy

15:36.068 --> 15:40.164
And if it is less clear it will
angry / good I understand

15:44.076 --> 15:47.205
Sir, you just explained it
easy outline / is this easy

15:49.148 --> 15:53.176
Otherwise we reduce the data
/ borrow money must pay

15:54.120 --> 15:55.247
Think you can extend the day
refunding costs

15:55.321 --> 15:57.153
which is so big that causes
the occurrence of a problem like this

16:00.259 --> 16:02.023
Just explain in detail

16:12.271 --> 16:14.297
Son of President Kim Yousam,
hyunji was sentenced by

16:14.307 --> 16:16.299
court because of the court
waiting for a guarantee

16:17.109 --> 16:20.273
The US dollar is not enough,
then just buy it

16:21.180 --> 16:25.117
More speed of dollar spending
fast from buying / head of finance

16:25.284 --> 16:29.051
Yes, the president / not
say economic foundation

16:29.121 --> 16:32.057
Korea is strong so it's not
will be affected

The country's economy will definitely improve, why
You don't see what your identity is

19:43.182 --> 19:50.055
Come here to make a profit
not bad for you guys, yeah auntie

19:51.190 --> 19:57.130
Of course, thanks to Mr. Yoon I can
buy another building in gangman

19:58.164 --> 20:03.102
Uncle / person who is here is not
anyone dares to doubt your ability

20:03.302 --> 20:10.141
Yes right / I don't feel right
will be more than a week

20:13.012 --> 20:19.043
South Korea will be destroyed /
why do you say that

20:22.021 --> 20:25.185
The reason Korea will be destroyed is only two words

20:32.131 --> 20:38.037
Yu Xin (public trust)

20:39.205 --> 20:42.198
In the world of finance, lend
money for someone else

20:42.241 --> 20:45.177
or company called yu
xin (public trust)

20:47.246 --> 20:54.210
Xin (trust) trusts money
those who are released will definitely return

20:55.287 --> 20:59.190
But this belief really isn't
trustworthy, useless

21:00.126 --> 21:03.096
Since the beginning of this year it has slowly been seen

21:05.064 --> 21:06.088
I have a feeling

21:08.100 --> 21:13.266
I give one example,
here are entrepreneurs

21:16.308 --> 21:20.040
Please see
entrepreneurs want to do

21:20.045 --> 21:23.140
business but no
money, then what should it be

21:24.150 --> 21:27.143
Build factories, replace
car, then search

21:27.153 --> 21:29.281
driver, you already
be a successful person

21:31.056 --> 21:35.050
You want to live like this
until when / thank you

21:35.194 --> 21:41.031
But ... This amount of money / why
Do not like

21:41.100 --> 21:45.128
No, no, I match it
first / if

21:45.137 --> 21:49.006
so how to pay it
use check only

21:52.111 --> 21:59.018
One problem will appear, check
this is actually what kind of check

22:01.120 --> 22:02.144
Not a bank here

22:04.056 --> 22:05.285
The document has been prepared
/ company that is

22:05.291 --> 22:07.157
called comprehensive
finance is not a bank

22:08.194 --> 22:12.097
The company goes to the bank
to give a check then

22:12.097 --> 22:15.158
the check was given to
companies other than banks

22:17.136 --> 22:23.042
Then what will happen to me?
count in a matter of three

22:23.309 --> 22:33.308
One ... Two ... Three / loans have been cleared

22:36.155 --> 22:41.253
Fine, thank you / surprise
is a bank in an instant

22:41.293 --> 22:46.254
which has been matched with a check
loaned to another person

22:47.199 --> 22:51.034
Do check as guarantee
this has a legal effect

22:51.070 --> 22:53.096
No one care,
nobody asked

22:53.138 --> 22:55.039
just give it away
loan to them

22:57.076 --> 23:01.070
So all this time, check the bill
will be played back

23:01.113 --> 23:04.208
company hands
small and medium

23:05.217 --> 23:08.187
Previously we always did
transactions with cash

23:08.187 --> 23:11.089
/ who is now
still using cash

23:12.091 --> 23:15.152
Of course using bill checks / why

23:15.194 --> 23:18.062
Lately who uses it
cash in transactions

23:18.197 --> 23:20.166
I'll contact me later,
I still have business, still

23:20.199 --> 23:22.134
many people want to meet
with me / fine

23:22.301 --> 23:25.135
Be careful /
small and medium enterprises

23:25.170 --> 23:28.038
like that, then how
with big companies

23:29.041 --> 23:33.103
Through banks, through foreign banks

23:33.212 --> 23:36.080
Through investment capital
foreign, making debt

23:36.115 --> 23:38.175
as a guarantee for
looking for debt again

23:39.218 --> 23:48.184
Then this debt will
keep going down, keep going down

23:49.061 --> 23:55.092
If the business booms, it will return
capital, this is a happy ending

23:56.135 --> 24:01.164
If if one chain is broken then
sooner or later everything will be destroyed

24:03.108 --> 24:07.045
Really like that elsewhere
not heard of anything like this

24:07.079 --> 24:09.048
Because of this transaction
happened with no

24:09.081 --> 24:11.073
the foundation of trust
as guarantee

24:11.150 --> 24:16.088
And south korea
until 1997 continued

24:16.121 --> 24:21.287
spin chained yangs
like this, sorry

24:24.063 --> 24:29.058
It's like a time bomb
will definitely explode this year

24:30.269 --> 24:34.001
I issued an assessment like that

24:41.013 --> 24:42.174
You don't say one step

24:44.183 --> 24:49.178
What if the government interferes
Before this time bomb exploded

24:50.022 --> 24:52.116
If the government handles it,
issue a policy, what about it

24:54.159 --> 24:58.255
A free market economy will
what kind of policy is issued

24:59.231 --> 25:01.063
We should issue
warning that

25:01.066 --> 25:02.159
country is located
in the economic crisis

25:05.237 --> 25:08.036
Not all policies
must start from here

25:08.073 --> 25:10.167
/ no, why do we have to
tell the crisis

25:11.210 --> 25:17.047
South Korea will go bankrupt, destroyed, why
You don't just make an ad

25:17.216 --> 25:20.118
The people have the right to know
how is the policy and

25:20.152 --> 25:23.020
assessment of the present situation
the government took

25:24.089 --> 25:25.148
In which book
write like that

25:27.192 --> 25:29.286
If the economic market is destroyed then
it can't be helped anymore

25:30.095 --> 25:33.088
It was made noisy like that instead
will make people more dizzy,

25:33.132 --> 25:36.227
we should find a way to
get more time

25:36.301 --> 25:38.270
If we don't take it
action, just winning time,

25:38.270 --> 25:40.239
then the losses will increase, who
who will be responsible

25:41.240 --> 25:44.142
The people don't have the most
the right to know

25:44.143 --> 25:46.169
state of the country
now / han seohyun

25:51.016 --> 25:56.045
So important is the right
what you say

25:56.255 --> 25:59.191
Still in doubt what are the opportunities
will not come again

26:00.025 --> 26:04.156
If we just get the bill check, then
what about securities loans

26:05.130 --> 26:09.067
Have them wait, wait
until the bill has expired

26:09.201 --> 26:13.263
Take money and give it to them,
just like that, quickly paste the sample

26:14.106 --> 26:16.234
Now is the time for
people make decisions,

26:16.241 --> 26:18.233
at least we give
warning them

26:20.012 --> 26:20.240
Will this cause a commotion

26:21.046 --> 26:23.015
Then will mom han
responsible if

26:23.015 --> 26:24.210
everyone cancel
financial transactions

26:25.050 --> 26:27.144
Why can you say cancel

26:29.021 --> 26:30.216
It's not just a soft landing

26:32.191 --> 26:35.252
The government will certainly not notify
to all of us / why are you so sure

26:36.128 --> 26:40.065
Because now there is a phenomenon
which indicates a crisis

26:41.166 --> 26:43.226
They still don't care about all that

26:49.274 --> 26:53.109
Sir, we must give
announcement to the people

26:54.046 --> 26:57.016
You can't, this will
cause fear

26:59.218 --> 27:04.156
Because the husband doesn't get it
salary causes difficulties

27:05.090 --> 27:09.027
Because you can't pay the debt
dibursa effect then sell the house

27:09.228 --> 27:13.996
Uncle, what is this event / era of women

27:18.103 --> 27:22.131
Sir, we must announce, at the most
will not reduce people's losses

27:26.044 --> 27:27.068
Stick the stamp

27:29.281 --> 27:32.251
The country is already on the road
headed for bankruptcy

27:32.251 --> 27:35.016
but the government doesn't
do anything

27:36.121 --> 27:39.182
If it's not useless
then do not understand anything

27:41.226 --> 27:43.252
A time like this
say that country

27:43.262 --> 27:45.197
facing a crisis,
the election will begin

27:46.031 --> 27:49.195
This will be used by other parties

27:50.102 --> 27:54.039
This must be related to the party
my opponent / I will invest

27:54.039 --> 27:57.066
in countries that don't or not
useful, don't understand anything

27:58.143 --> 28:01.272
Still thinking about what else,
Quickly give me the stamp

28:14.059 --> 28:14.992
Sir

28:30.309 --> 28:32.073
We are now facing a crisis
will cause state bankruptcy

28:41.019 --> 28:42.112
Must be a secret

28:44.189 --> 28:49.184
From now on the team
policies must be kept confidential

28:49.228 --> 28:53.188
in financial companies
and public opinion

29:01.240 --> 29:03.038
Nothing will happen

29:07.279 --> 29:11.046
Sir, wait a minute, wait a minute, sir

29:12.084 --> 29:15.145
Sir cannot be hidden,
if something happens later

29:15.153 --> 29:18.089
what about those who
will suffer losses

29:18.223 --> 29:21.057
At least we have to help
healthy small and medium enterprises

29:23.028 --> 29:25.122
What a small company and
medium healthy

29:28.166 --> 29:29.225
Then who gives
their health check

30:03.302 --> 30:08.002
Which other person / seems
some are lacking with my speech

30:09.241 --> 30:10.209
No one wants to believe

30:13.111 --> 30:16.013
You say this country
unable to manage

30:16.048 --> 30:18.244
crisis, I will invest
on your words

30:28.026 --> 30:32.088
Cool, I was very interested earlier
with what you say

30:32.130 --> 30:36.067
not useless means
know nothing

30:38.070 --> 30:41.199
You are very cool / how old are you

30:42.174 --> 30:44.234
24 years / go there bad boy

30:46.144 --> 30:49.171
Why, isn't this
investment explanation

30:50.248 --> 30:53.218
I am very rich

31:14.206 --> 31:20.146
Please sit down / ok

31:30.088 --> 31:33.058
Mama / just come home

31:33.091 --> 31:38.189
Why is it returning so late, me
miss my mom / kids dear

31:39.297 --> 31:45.100
Hyunju, our company
will enter the mall shop

31:47.139 --> 31:50.200
Really / yes, you know what the value is

31:54.312 --> 31:58.079
Oh my god, that's great

31:59.217 --> 32:05.179
I'm worried about costs
hyunna entered junior high school, great

32:06.124 --> 32:08.093
Wait until this project
you're done no need

32:08.126 --> 32:10.061
work / just wait
until this project is complete

32:12.063 --> 32:13.031
You are great

32:19.137 --> 32:23.131
Further news regarding opinion
South Korea's economic crisis

32:23.241 --> 32:26.177
The head of the economic center said
Such rumors are unfounded

32:26.311 --> 32:30.112
The economy of our country is rising

32:30.182 --> 32:32.981
South Korea's economy now
is in position number 11 in the world

32:33.151 --> 32:35.211
The foundation is still strong,
at this stage korea

32:35.220 --> 32:37.280
south has passed
period of economic downturn

32:38.123 --> 32:42.083
Our representative soccer team yesterday
defeat the United Arab Emirates 3: 0

32:42.260 --> 32:47.995
Hoping to beat France
in the next round of 16 matches

32:55.240 --> 32:58.108
Hang on a little longer,
wait a few days

32:58.109 --> 33:00.237
again / we don't
can confirm this

33:01.146 --> 33:04.014
Washington post publishes
Foreign bank articles refused

33:04.015 --> 33:06.007
to guarantee exports
by a South Korean bank

33:06.151 --> 33:08.211
Hedge funds are operated
by Soros also stated

33:08.253 --> 33:11.052
if the nominal is right no
will extend again

33:11.156 --> 33:15.287
I don't think it's worth it
keep this a secret, this is it

33:15.293 --> 33:19.253
vicious circle / go away,
what we need now

33:20.298 --> 33:22.199
Is proof that you can
shake the evidence of the leaders

33:22.234 --> 33:24.100
hiding ones that don't
have any policy

33:24.236 --> 33:26.262
We now collect evidence
to cover their mouths

33:28.006 --> 33:33.001
The first is a bank and a body
finance other than banks in the market

33:34.212 --> 33:37.114
Ministry of Finance employees,
Korean bank and bank

33:37.148 --> 33:40.175
commercial, we have to block
first the worst

33:41.119 --> 33:44.146
Excitement, from now on we are a system

33:46.157 --> 33:50.185
You must meet with
this person / who

34:03.308 --> 34:07.006
Introducing, he is
head of the ministry team

34:07.012 --> 34:09.174
finance / hello, happy
meet you

34:11.149 --> 34:13.118
He is a senior mba from
Harvard University, then next

34:13.150 --> 34:15.016
we have to meet with
president / I will try

34:16.187 --> 34:20.215
Not polite, the angle is lacking / has come

34:23.295 --> 34:24.228
How are you

34:29.067 --> 34:32.036
Your arrival is right
once, he is a child

34:32.036 --> 34:34.199
from Lee Donghyun the owner
ridong company

34:34.239 --> 34:37.107
I do not know,
Nice to meet you

34:40.045 --> 34:42.172
My father told me to come
so I came,

34:42.179 --> 34:45.047
I don't know what myself
I have to say

34:45.283 --> 34:51.280
Harvard graduates gather together
talk about pleasant things

34:53.091 --> 34:57.187
How is the director
/ alright

34:59.297 --> 35:01.095
Junior

35:04.035 --> 35:06.095
Director no
young again, already

35:06.137 --> 35:09.073
should accept
training as heir

35:11.276 --> 35:13.244
But nobody can
I do / you

35:13.244 --> 35:15.236
will soon find out something
you can do

35:19.017 --> 35:25.116
Please convey to the director, him
will definitely be happy / convey what

35:29.227 --> 35:35.030
The country will soon go bankrupt, the situation
will experience major changes

35:36.267 --> 35:40.102
Although using any method, already
must take the right policy

35:42.273 --> 35:44.265
Why say this to me

35:47.178 --> 35:48.168
Friend, because you are friends

36:02.260 --> 36:05.230
We are a policy team
currency of bank of korea,

36:05.230 --> 36:08.064
as supervisor will
conducting impromptu inspections

36:14.139 --> 36:16.199
How much loan is given
by the first bank for hanbao steel

36:17.242 --> 36:22.078
Approximately 1.8 trillion / now
how much bank funds

36:22.180 --> 36:27.244
870 billion / why is the debt issued
more than existing bank funds

36:28.286 --> 36:30.278
Sorry / first when you were
give that debt

36:30.288 --> 36:32.257
so big this is there
proof or not

36:33.124 --> 36:35.116
Until now every
give debt to

36:35.160 --> 36:37.254
company never
do separate research

36:40.098 --> 36:43.068
It should be a bank supervisory body
stop this / no

36:43.301 --> 36:47.136
Who is responsible
supervised / that ...

36:49.007 --> 36:50.100
Me / what
visit:
NFS31. XYZ
by @than Guavaberry

36:50.241 --> 36:53.211
I once worked as a supervisory body
the bank is responsible for overseeing

36:54.245 --> 36:58.046
Before the hanbao problem
investigate here, if it's hanbao

36:58.083 --> 37:01.053
no problem too
will not come here

37:03.088 --> 37:06.057
Sorry / why is the head office
hanbao is in the area

37:06.057 --> 37:09.152
the settlement was based on
count of fortune tellers

37:12.030 --> 37:12.258
Astrologer

37:14.132 --> 37:19.070
Crazy / child and wife are all in Canada

37:20.004 --> 37:22.235
Do you know the exchange rate
what will increase / who will

37:22.273 --> 37:25.141
say that hanbo can
profitable in the field of steel

37:25.243 --> 37:30.011
That is also advice from the fortune teller / I don't
know about the director and the fortune teller

37:30.115 --> 37:36.021
Is it not through board approval /
council, this is still talking about the council

37:38.089 --> 37:41.150
The loan is eaten by the child
president, for what to come

37:41.192 --> 37:44.993
here / how much money
hanbo borrowed from the bank

37:46.164 --> 37:51.102
Hey Lee, I'm a university
what class are we / senior

37:51.269 --> 37:55.036
I asked how many were
accepted unknown hanbo

37:55.039 --> 37:58.009
by other people / why you
behave like that to seniors

37:58.176 --> 38:00.077
Senior / why, brash

38:11.089 --> 38:12.148
Do you not understand the situation

38:17.061 --> 38:19.155
Because you use it
relations with the government force

38:19.197 --> 38:21.223
to disburse trillion funds,
our country will be destroyed

38:24.235 --> 38:27.296
You turned on the bomb at that time

38:31.309 --> 38:36.009
So where do we go /
I will buy American dollars first

38:37.315 --> 38:42.015
When trust in Korea decreases, who
which will first exit the Exchange

38:42.287 --> 38:45.052
The exchange rate is now around $ 1: 800 won

38:46.090 --> 38:50.152
Is according to Mr. Yoon
the exchange rate will rise again

38:52.197 --> 39:00.264
I think 2000 won / 2000
More than twice

39:03.007 --> 39:06.171
This is still not enough, us
will buy shares plummet,

39:06.211 --> 39:10.148
after the exchange rate can explode
get a big profit

39:18.022 --> 39:21.117
The rate increase is enough,
the stock has dropped enough,

39:21.159 --> 39:24.095
buy there buy here, this
is the basis of investment

39:25.063 --> 39:28.158
You are the opposite, if you
you want to make money

39:29.267 --> 39:32.066
This ... Unless the country is destroyed

39:33.037 --> 39:35.029
If you want to do it
that, I can do it too

39:35.073 --> 39:36.268
for you / if
so do it for us

39:53.258 --> 39:56.023
As the company opens
improper project

39:56.194 --> 39:58.026
The bank also provides loans to
company under review

39:58.096 --> 40:00.292
For the sake of making a situation
fake the political world

40:00.298 --> 40:04.065
give them money /
Nothing is perfect

40:04.202 --> 40:08.071
Tidka knows how to set it up, Hanbo
just borrow 5 trillion won in money

40:08.273 --> 40:11.243
Can't blame the other party,
the bank of korea also got it wrong

40:12.143 --> 40:16.012
We are the eye policy agency
money has what responsibility

40:16.147 --> 40:20.107
Not that you have sent the laoranya,
when hanbok goes bankrupt, when kia goes bankrupt

40:20.251 --> 40:22.117
How many times did you send it?
lots of analysis reports,

40:22.153 --> 40:24.019
but it turns out they are the same
I don't want to hear it once

40:27.025 --> 40:31.190
Foreigners sell shares
in a row, the stock market plummeted

40:31.262 --> 40:36.257
Less than 10 minutes the stock dropped 20  /  ,
new marketing immediately dropped dramatically

40:37.068 --> 40:40.163
Stock starts just 5 minutes
foreigners who sell their shares

40:40.238 --> 40:45.074
During the past month foreigners sold
Its shares in Korea reach 300 billion won

40:45.176 --> 40:49.045
Until this month the value of release
shares reached 580 billion won

40:50.081 --> 40:52.209
If strangers take off
stock and leave

40:52.250 --> 40:55.049
korea causes the exchange rate
also keep going up

40:55.253 --> 40:57.245
New foreign exchange market
start trading

40:57.255 --> 40:59.190
Just 5 minutes straight
broke up doing a transaction

41:00.091 --> 41:03.186
Exchange rates explode, causing first
times the market situation occurs

41:03.194 --> 41:06.164
new foreign exchange doing
the transaction was forced to close

41:06.264 --> 41:09.098
Current foreign exchange market
is experiencing torpor

41:09.300 --> 41:14.102
Company bill check percentage
up from yesterday at 0.87  /   

41:15.239 --> 41:18.038
The government is preparing it

41:19.110 --> 41:21.045
Until now only
temporary chaos, definitely not

41:21.045 --> 41:22.274
will enter into concern,
surely nothing will happen

41:23.281 --> 41:25.273
Not a bad thing, huh
right / quickly close the phone

41:26.250 --> 41:31.154
Affected by the stock market boom
Hong Kong and the Southeast Asian economic crisis

41:31.289 --> 41:33.281
Starting from an eye crisis
Thai money, then

41:33.291 --> 41:36.056
Philippines, Indonesia,
Hong Kong and other countries

41:36.160 --> 41:38.152
Will it affect
korean financial market

41:38.196 --> 41:40.131
south, this thing
very worrying

41:41.032 --> 41:47.165
Exchange rates have reached the highest history
/ Mr. Yoon, have come, succeeded

41:49.073 --> 41:54.137
Rich, this time it will be rich /
listen to me, have to say no

41:56.014 --> 41:57.175
No need to talk about useless ones

42:00.051 --> 42:01.246
Just say it's taking
action, hear no

42:02.120 --> 42:05.147
A lot of these days
bankrupt company,

42:05.189 --> 42:08.091
mall metupo too right
bankruptcy

42:08.292 --> 42:12.161
Repeated once again mall metupo
will soon experience bankruptcy

42:12.296 --> 42:16.028
For the sake of not experiencing it
bankruptcy metupo

42:16.067 --> 42:19.128
are discussing with
cooperating parties

42:19.270 --> 42:23.037
And temporarily closes
during warehouse checking

42:56.007 --> 42:58.135
Get out, get out

43:04.148 --> 43:09.052
Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee / Mr. Lee
there, fast catch, catch

43:24.235 --> 43:28.104
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

43:30.074 --> 43:35.012
Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee, is not bankrupt
right, don't go bankrupt right

43:35.146 --> 43:38.082
Please be patient, we ... /
are you intentionally bankrupt?

43:38.149 --> 43:41.244
There is no such thing
is our sweat money, give it back

43:42.019 --> 43:46.184
Are you like this enough
/ whatever this is

43:46.290 --> 43:51.285
Until now, metupo debt
in the bank it reached 310 billion won

43:52.096 --> 43:54.190
Debt to financial institutions
besides the bank reaches

43:54.198 --> 43:56.167
215 billion won,
the effect is not small

43:57.101 --> 43:59.195
The plan for tomorrow's metupo will be
file deferred execution

44:00.037 --> 44:03.166
If the instruction is not
accepted it will be carried out

44:03.207 --> 44:06.234
based on legal channels /
Hanna's company went bankrupt

44:09.080 --> 44:12.244
Taiyang Jingmi also filed for bankruptcy
/ new core companies filed for bankruptcy

44:14.285 --> 44:20.225
Do you sir, hear that dayoo is in danger

44:22.260 --> 44:25.230
What is the director of Kim Yoojong
submit direct discussion

44:30.168 --> 44:33.036
Chairman han, where is the head going?

44:44.248 --> 44:49.186
Sir, calm down first, please come down first

44:50.021 --> 44:55.050
First we will talk carefully,
Sir, we all have difficulties too

44:56.127 --> 44:59.154
Sir, you have to think about your family too

45:00.064 --> 45:02.192
Come on down, down and talk about it

45:03.201 --> 45:04.169
Ask you to go down

45:20.084 --> 45:22.212
Haedong company experienced
insufficient finance and

45:22.253 --> 45:25.121
can last until now,
today filed for bankruptcy

45:25.289 --> 45:27.190
Today's company
file run

45:27.225 --> 45:28.989
by law
to the prosecutor's office

45:29.060 --> 45:33.122
Doubt Korea can
pay short-term debt

45:33.264 --> 45:35.199
Collapse of securities institutions
is a situation

45:35.199 --> 45:36.997
who have never been
happened before

45:38.269 --> 45:40.261
Today there are 3 companies entering
in 30 large companies, 20 companies

45:40.304 --> 45:42.273
who entered the order of hundreds
strong companies go bankrupt

45:43.140 --> 45:45.268
If it is a company
combined then day

45:45.309 --> 45:48.074
there are 200 more
bankrupt company

45:48.179 --> 45:50.114
Focusing on the introduction of bonds
low flower from asia

45:50.114 --> 45:52.083
southeast by integrated company,
the situation has expanded

45:52.250 --> 45:54.242
If a financial company
integrated bankrupt,

45:54.252 --> 45:56.187
then check the bank bill
will be withdrawn

45:57.188 --> 46:00.090
Then there is a possibility
the bank will go bankrupt

46:00.258 --> 46:02.250
Centered on Wall Street
report bankruptcy

46:02.260 --> 46:04.126
South Korea will
come as a fact

46:05.062 --> 46:06.121
If you take Korea, integrate
finance to get started

46:06.130 --> 46:07.154
then financial institutions
banking is also in danger

46:26.017 --> 46:32.048
As predicted,
now the stock has dropped

46:33.090 --> 46:36.151
Won's Korean value continues
declining, dollar value

46:36.160 --> 46:39.289
America continues to go up, bro
we are riding right

46:41.065 --> 46:46.060
Korea is destroyed, we are rich

46:48.072 --> 46:49.233
We will be rich

46:53.077 --> 46:55.103
Mr. Yoon what are you doing

46:56.147 --> 47:01.085
Sir song, now is not the time
buy dollars and buy shares

47:02.086 --> 47:04.055
Then, what should you do?

47:06.123 --> 47:08.991
But it's time to change
life, the way of life

47:09.026 --> 47:11.018
branching,
life will change

47:14.131 --> 47:15.997
Now, right now

47:17.101 --> 47:22.096
My life, level, identity

47:25.309 --> 47:27.107
Will change at this time

47:34.185 --> 47:36.017
Take more money here

47:38.055 --> 47:41.116
And don't do two things
in front of me, respect me

47:47.131 --> 47:48.258
And don't be happy because
can benefit

48:02.146 --> 48:04.240
Please take your mind out

48:12.256 --> 48:15.226
Not a lack of policy
at all / what it is

48:16.227 --> 48:18.196
Go to imf / what

48:19.130 --> 48:27.163
If you go to imf you will probably
troublesome / the medicine is bitter, right

48:29.106 --> 48:30.267
Actually this is very easy

48:31.242 --> 48:34.144
College banks have no money
then borrow from the hanyi bank,

48:34.178 --> 48:37.046
if the hanyi bank doesn't have it
money between loans between banks

48:37.148 --> 48:40.016
But the problem now is no
care about short-term loans

48:40.084 --> 48:42.212
or problem loans, now
we need a lot of money

48:42.253 --> 48:45.087
But foreign exchange reserves are not
enough, isn't this the problem

48:45.256 --> 48:48.021
Get funding
from imf, this is

48:48.058 --> 48:50.027
the most way
effective and simple

48:50.161 --> 48:56.101
But imf not a bank that can provide
debt to anyone, you know that too

48:57.168 --> 49:01.128
It will definitely be the whole Korean economy ...
know, I understand

49:01.305 --> 49:04.036
But what can I do, I have to
resolved quickly

49:04.241 --> 49:08.178
Fire has expanded, must use
what brand of extinguisher, what is important

49:09.046 --> 49:14.212
Don't borrow money at imf
not a perfect policy

49:17.054 --> 49:18.113
Imf not a bank

49:19.190 --> 49:21.056
Will definitely be done
financial assistance as

49:21.091 --> 49:23.026
terms, and give
various requests

49:23.260 --> 49:26.094
Can cause holders
the economy will be taken by imf

49:26.130 --> 49:31.091
We have to change, maybe a request
imf will make Korea better

49:31.202 --> 49:35.003
Of course not, reform
south korea economy

49:35.306 --> 49:40.176
With inadequate foreign exchange reserves
must be separated / hey, bank employee

49:46.116 --> 49:48.051
Amount of money now
cannot be compared

49:48.052 --> 49:49.145
with that money
in your bank

49:50.254 --> 49:54.282
It's just small money, now
discussed is policy, politics

49:56.060 --> 49:58.996
Carry out investigations, economic analysis
Korea is actually turned like

49:59.029 --> 50:01.157
what, then how many problems,
isn't this report you made

50:02.166 --> 50:05.227
But now you say
unnecessary, must be distinguished

50:09.106 --> 50:11.075
So what is the policy according to mother han

50:12.109 --> 50:15.079
Borrow from a bank in Japan,
America and some

50:15.079 --> 50:17.241
as many countries in Europe
$ 10 billion dollars

50:18.048 --> 50:20.040
Complete debt first
urgent foreign affairs,

50:20.084 --> 50:21.279
and this way / last
how after that

50:22.219 --> 50:26.987
Then after / foreign debt
now it's almost $ 100

50:27.024 --> 50:31.155
billion dollars, and a loan of $ 10 billion
dollar for urgent, then

50:32.096 --> 50:35.089
State assets as
guarantee, issue a letter

50:35.132 --> 50:38.261
bonds abroad, you can
think about issuing abs

50:52.049 --> 50:53.142
Is it just me who feels funny
The situation is so cold

50:57.054 --> 50:59.216
Really unexpected,
mother han is a person

50:59.256 --> 51:01.282
which uses
feeling in acting

51:02.126 --> 51:05.221
Used to issue
lots of data, evidence, documents

51:06.096 --> 51:09.157
Apparently using the feeling at that time
in making decisions, is that so

51:11.001 --> 51:12.970
Borrow money from banks
foreign, issuing abs

51:16.140 --> 51:19.133
Do you think so
will help the situation now

51:21.245 --> 51:23.043
Chairman Han Seohyun

51:26.050 --> 51:27.109
Okay then

51:28.285 --> 51:32.017
Suppose because it's not fast
borrow aid funds at imf

51:32.189 --> 51:34.988
Cause the country
announced bankruptcy,

51:35.025 --> 51:37.119
at that time, mother han
can be responsible

51:39.163 --> 51:41.132
Know why in government
no upper level woman

51:41.999 --> 51:43.991
Can't make a decision
the right time is important

51:49.239 --> 51:51.265
That's the woman inside
doing something /

51:51.275 --> 51:54.040
no need to say
saying like that, ok

51:54.278 --> 51:57.146
Sir, you have to think about it
well, now han mom is the same

51:57.147 --> 51:59.241
once don't think about how much
the severity of the present situation

52:00.250 --> 52:03.084
From the start it should stay at the bank of
Korea to write a research report

52:03.153 --> 52:07.284
Typing computers, come here
really ... / sir

52:08.258 --> 52:13.128
Well, I know, the decision leaves me
who take it, rest first

52:18.235 --> 52:22.002
Don't just stand there, fast
make coffee between here / enough

52:22.239 --> 52:25.038
Brash / upbeat
the team here is good too

52:38.222 --> 52:40.248
Imf, what is too much

52:43.093 --> 52:45.153
It must be less / what

52:46.063 --> 52:47.224
If you want to change
all that is inside

52:47.231 --> 52:48.995
this country of course
must be excessive

52:49.299 --> 52:52.201
Means you don't
because of currency issues

52:52.202 --> 52:55.138
foreigners, how come
return the money

52:55.305 --> 52:58.275
As Han Seohyun said,
help emergencies / but

53:02.079 --> 53:04.241
I don't think so
miss this opportunity

53:07.017 --> 53:11.113
Now Korea must change, this
it's not just a foreign exchange crisis

53:13.290 --> 53:17.057
Little factory employees
demo, strike

53:17.194 --> 53:20.028
I think this is an opportunity
change a country like this from its roots

53:21.298 --> 53:23.267
A new opportunity to go to Korea

53:29.273 --> 53:33.267
Go tell the boss to
invite the president imf here / good

53:39.216 --> 53:40.275
Not that America also takes action

53:43.253 --> 53:45.085
We will just go with the flow

53:58.202 --> 54:01.263
Already sure, as bad
Whatever we don't do

54:01.271 --> 54:05.003
borrow to imf first, we try
try first

54:07.111 --> 54:11.139
Chairman, please contact the interior ministry
country, may not exchange currencies

54:12.015 --> 54:15.042
Even though it might be too
slow, but we can try it

54:32.169 --> 54:36.163
How to develop
in a situation like this

54:37.040 --> 54:40.238
Why doesn't anyone come out
to talk, what to do

54:43.280 --> 54:45.249
Now we must give
how much to suppliers

54:48.185 --> 54:52.213
Gangban 100 million won, jieke 150
million won, boss jun 100 million won

54:54.158 --> 54:57.026
But these three places use names
the company issued the bill check

54:59.196 --> 55:03.133
If within a specified time
can't pay then we will be arrested

55:04.101 --> 55:06.161
This is only temporary, isn't it
the government has said that

55:07.237 --> 55:11.231
Newspaper, the news isn't saying
that soon it will be finished

55:14.178 --> 55:17.046
We are looking for funds first plus
remaining company funds

55:18.015 --> 55:20.985
If it's still lacking, sell a house
I can, it can be paid

55:33.096 --> 55:37.227
How are you doing please sit down

55:39.069 --> 55:42.164
Recently
there are many homes for sale

55:43.073 --> 55:45.167
Yeah right, it's weird
since three months

55:45.175 --> 55:47.269
then keep going a lot
people who sell houses

55:48.178 --> 55:51.307
Most small and medium houses
/ Yes, right

55:56.186 --> 55:58.280
All save for me

56:01.058 --> 56:02.253
Are you crazy

56:04.127 --> 56:09.156
That's my money / it should still be
down approximately 10-15  /   

56:11.034 --> 56:16.029
I will buy at that time
everything / well, I understand

56:23.313 --> 56:27.080
This is just like being
ride on the back of the tiger

56:27.217 --> 56:30.278
The future situation will be like what Yang is
I mean government action

56:34.258 --> 56:37.023
They are busy fighting

56:39.029 --> 56:42.295
Do you have to borrow from imf
or do not have to borrow

56:45.035 --> 56:51.032
Where is imf / imf

56:55.245 --> 57:01.048
Pour the wine / good

57:02.119 --> 57:06.215
Actually not
borrow to imf too

57:06.256 --> 57:11.160
there are still other ways to
controlling the crisis

57:13.130 --> 57:15.099
The bond will become
useless paper

57:16.099 --> 57:21.094
Bos song and I will
sleep on the road, thank you

57:24.174 --> 57:25.233
Even though it's still me

57:29.112 --> 57:36.986
They will definitely go borrow to IMF,
put everything / whatever in mind

57:38.155 --> 57:44.094
They are all market economics,
although looking for ways to

57:44.094 --> 57:50.159
out of crisis certainly do
which can help big companies

57:52.035 --> 57:59.033
There is only one such method,
get a loan from imf

57:59.276 --> 58:04.078
For this reason it will
make major repairs

58:06.083 --> 58:07.244
Making the crisis an opportunity

58:09.286 --> 58:13.155
Based on the rich as a benchmark,
want to plan a new economic situation

58:14.124 --> 58:18.027
Such a policy is certain
will be rejected by the people

58:18.061 --> 58:21.122
/ they must have
reason to ward it off

58:24.301 --> 58:28.204
That's because of your consumptive nature
causing the country's economy to collapse

58:29.139 --> 58:32.132
That's all because you can't
refrain from spending money

58:34.044 --> 58:36.240
But I can't
lied to, it won't work

58:40.217 --> 58:42.277
It won't be fooled by them

58:47.290 --> 58:52.058
Tonight there must be lots of people
who can't sleep

58:59.202 --> 59:00.135
It will be okay

59:04.107 --> 59:05.131
It is okay
visit:
NFS31. XYZ
by @than Guavaberry

59:11.081 --> 59:12.049
It will pass

59:30.033 --> 59:33.003
Despite facing a crisis
economy but in part

59:33.003 --> 59:35.199
people still like it
foreign products

59:35.272 --> 59:37.969
Luxury trip out
the country is increasing

59:38.075 --> 59:42.137
Because overseas travel causes
foreign exchange reserves are slowly decreasing

59:48.218 --> 59:54.158
The evening news started from chaos
money market and economic crisis

59:54.257 --> 59:59.127
What do you think,
why not pick up the telephone /

59:59.162 --> 01:00:04.066
some still don't get it
confirmation, yes right

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.229
Good morning

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:19.278
Is this what you ordered? This is not
can replace the current policy team leader

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.023
Do you want to direct the order
finally borrowing to imf

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:41.164
Your team is very special,
starting from team members, really

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:46.066
Hi bank employee, I was wrong
one chairman in the finance department

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:51.275
It turns out that dare not respect me
and instead threatens me, is this true

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:56.983
That's because you are the team leader,
so it's like that

01:00:57.053 --> 01:01:01.081
Calm down first / don't pull
me, let me kill him

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:06.119
Say one more time, less
teach, say one more time

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.157
What are you doing, everybody
in the same line

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.032
When in a chaotic state, no
there is a fight in the east and west

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:20.008
Chairman han, how do you take care
subordinate / I'm sorry sir

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:25.071
I'm wrong, I'm the most
consider my team important

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:29.048
In the future you don't have to
come here, come out

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:41.062
The situation is even worse now
from the situation at any time

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.259
The fate of approximately 40
million residents are determined

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:47.101
by our decision, then
from that must be careful

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:52.040
From now on the policy team
will become an imf agreement team

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:57.011
When the president is still in office
not allowed to go bankrupt,

01:01:57.013 --> 01:02:00.040
therefore decide to
receive imf assistance funds

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.987
This is a scheme that hasn't
never discussed before

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:09.049
Before passing the peak period, it must be
immediately receive funding

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:15.028
Chairman, get approval from IMF
still need time / have arrived

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.261
What / I said the person had come

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.044
Negotiate with IMF must
open / won't open

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.241
At the right time I will announce

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:36.210
Welcome to korea,
the place of agreement is at

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:40.987
hotel hilton, team office
the main agreement is there

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:46.120
Thank you for coming
you from far away / no

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:49.132
nothing, I have
want to come here

01:02:55.238 --> 01:03:00.108
Bring lots of lessons
for us, it's beautiful

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:06.206
The person has arrived at the hotel / well,
do not make agreements too long

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:11.053
Fast signatures quickly get
money and quickly solve the problem

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:17.093
Beyond reporters, what will you do?
say / of course you will say no

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.026
You have to say it
I expressly / say

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.023
no yes no, then what
what they will do

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.105
Get out, get out

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:34.202
Look here sir, he said the country will
face bankruptcy, is that true

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:39.106
No / is it really the economic crisis
the most severe will be coming soon

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:43.119
It is not true / there is news that Korea
get funding from imf

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:47.122
No, Korea won't
the way to the imf scheme

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:56.056
According to the new Korean finance minister
will not receive help from imf

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:59.064
Ministry of Finance
stated help imf ...

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:02.228
Have a meeting with daddy / good

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:06.140
The government says it won't
looking for imf, what will be fine

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:08.168
just don't be affected,
just believe me

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.277
The government refused everything, said
that the crisis will not go bankrupt too

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:19.149
They are just lying, they are
lying to all the people

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.015
If it turns out it can be overcome ...

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:29.065
I thought I could be lied to
I can't be fooled

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.197
Approximately $ 150 million right

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:40.038
Three years ago I issued
180 million, you know that too

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.043
You said it here
there will be developments

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.174
Convincing me of the price
will go up / that person

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.242
need all money
is selling a house

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:52.120
A day is more than
ten people sell houses

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.217
If the price is like that
I will not sell it,

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.217
I need money
not only that much

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.019
No, no, you know

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:04.030
Are you angry with me /
boss, if it's today

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:07.162
affixed, when it can be sold
I really need money

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:11.165
You are the same, the price is lower
a little / must go down how much

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.043
At least 10 million

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:38.998
Boss Kim, salary is still not paid
/ oh yes I have to give a salary

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.005
It's been two days

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:51.272
Today will be counted, sorry
/ sir boss, it's okay

01:05:52.282 --> 01:06:00.986
What / lately is a lot of news
bad is around, we are worried too

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:04.127
You have nothing, economics
it's not good right

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.096
many factories are closed, if
good economy overtime continues

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.062
Do not worry

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:17.265
Then we trust the boss
only, ready anytime for production

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:39.995
I already want to sell a house,
but only worth 150 million

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.063
Give the mojan there first

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:52.064
I am here

01:06:55.278 --> 01:07:00.080
There are 100 million, just take it first
to pay the boss gangban there

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:07.183
Do you borrow moneylenders / loan sharks

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:12.091
My wife's house is a guarantor

01:07:14.297 --> 01:07:20.259
How are you all / boss jun
sorry, really I'm sorry

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:26.039
Why is this, I'm just passing by,
then come here to see you

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.201
However I feel very embarrassed

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:33.080
Even if the world collapses,
I will definitely pay

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:36.246
you / we will remain
hang on, sorry, sorry

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:39.222
I told you I was coming
not here to collect debt

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:43.090
This, for you, in business
will definitely find anything,

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:46.221
I really don't need it much,
slowly pay

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:53.102
Thank you very much / definitely will
alright, don't starve

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:57.070
It will improve, we will
will continue to survive

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:03.112
Thank you very much / spirit,
smile, smile, I go first huh

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:08.974
Mr. jung / time is not necessary
come out, I go first

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:01.229
I know the condition of the South Korean economy

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:06.073
First I will make sure
is Korea really

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.977
sure to accept
financial assistance from imf

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:13.207
The government is very confident, but
in order to avoid commotion in the community

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:16.109
Therefore we want to
close agreement,

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:18.054
if today we can
complete the agreement

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:24.124
Tomorrow will open an agreement, and
will be ready to formally enter into an agreement

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.091
Okay, just follow your proposal

01:09:28.031 --> 01:09:29.124
But to make sure more

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:35.263
Namely the contents of the agreement, don't
there was overthrow or violation

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:38.274
Whose signature is
you mean / me

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.265
hear korea will
carrying out presidential elections

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:45.180
I need support from candidates
president, they must sign

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:49.117
If not, agreement
this will not happen

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:55.122
You may have no problems

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.251
No agreement has been made yet
request a guarantee letter /

01:09:58.261 --> 01:10:01.026
whether when an emergency wants
care about things like that

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:04.124
Still don't know what will happen
like agreement

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:06.159
what, why should I ask
signature of the presidential candidate

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:08.227
I will guarantee there is a guarantee letter
signature of the presidential candidate

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:16.145
Okay, then we know
South Korea's confidence

01:10:20.283 --> 01:10:23.253
Then you need
how much funds

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:33.061
Today the government decided to
receive bailouts from imf

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:37.261
Receive bailout funds
as much as $ 20 billion dollars

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:43.037
For the sake of handling the foreign exchange market
in Korea who have difficulty

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:46.209
The government decides
to ask for help

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:49.110
on imf for
provide bailouts

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.072
Before this, the government
already done the scheme

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:55.108
a lot to do
agreement with imf

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:58.085
Korea's economy
ever been above,

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.079
has changed acknowledging
country goes bankrupt

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:05.050
And a painful fact to return to life
under the supervision of international institutions

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:09.164
Finance Minister Kim Janhyun on
today stated that imf

01:11:09.165 --> 01:11:13.068
willing to help the economy
South Korea to return to life

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:19.268
Financial company operations are increasingly difficult,
state financial assets of 2.5 trillion

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:26.039
Today funds are 250
billion bought a clothing company

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:29.052
Government investigation team
imf do it tomorrow

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:32.214
bailout scale agreement
funds and terms clearly

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:36.089
Kim Janhyun stated
first bailout

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:39.062
may be exceeded
$ 20 billion dollars

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.133
This is an agreement scheme
our trade

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:57.204
prepare, starting from a
to f / from a to f, so ...

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:03.143
All of them have 6 schemes / actually before
there are conditions that have been agreed upon

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:10.286
In Korea based on the name of a financial company
there are 11 companies that are operating

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:13.291
Need companies
this bankrupt / company

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:16.027
there is indeed integrated finance
less good operating problems

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:19.133
But many companies borrow
money to the company

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:21.026
If the company is forced
bankrupt then company

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:22.005
small and medium loans
money from bodies other than banks

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:24.107
It's the same as the government
forcing them to go bankrupt

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:30.077
If so, it's very unfortunate, in 6
we cannot discuss the scheme again

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:41.257
Why do they want a company
bankrupt finance /

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.260
possible to lose
risk of korean economy

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.221
Acceptable, none
reason to reject it,

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:48.163
many financial companies
which really needs to be taken care of

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:50.199
Good if you can use it
imf as an excuse, all

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:52.099
can solve problems
that hurts the head

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:59.107
We can see the agreement scheme
first then decide

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.204
I once said this
is a prerequisite, if

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:05.113
do not agree to this agreement
will not be able to continue

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:11.180
Fine, I will stop 11
financial company / good

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:20.027
A Korean scheme must
immediately raise interest rates

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:23.226
after getting
bailout help from imf

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.295
Which from 12.5  /   is increased to 30  /   

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:34.043
Everyone knows the reason Korea arrived
towards the economic crisis is due to debt

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:37.080
Suddenly interest rates
doubled

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.275
then you have to pay
such a big debt

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:42.051
Never mind paying off debt,
instead we will go bankrupt

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:48.048
We made a proposal
in our judgment and

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:52.186
how you need to be
save Korean economy

01:13:53.296 --> 01:13:58.997
Detai from the agreement scheme
may be adjusted

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.036
But I remind you
that you don't

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:04.132
reach level
trade with us

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:23.158
Scheme b, Korea immediately opens a capital market
after getting bailouts from imf

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:26.194
First for foreigners
who bought shares

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:29.096
investment from that
now 7  /   becomes 50  /   

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:38.264
Allowing foreign financial institutions
can be united with the Korean financial body

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:45.172
Until June
1998, which is next year

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:49.049
Allowing foreign companies to
making bond companies in Korea

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:52.212
The same is true in the bond market,
foreign investment can be increased

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:58.119
And allow takeovers
large-scale foreign capital

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:06.058
Wait a minute, you say now
already violated the initial intention of imf

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:10.162
All international bodies do not
will make financial help

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:13.176
as an excuse to violate
economic self-discipline of a country

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:18.971
Wait a minute, chief han /
no, don't let him continue

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:23.210
I like people like you and me
sure we will be negotiating opponents

01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:00.247
South Korea's credit rating is ranked
moody and sandp have dropped, now b

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:06.253
There is news from the other side
the ocean is telling me

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:09.255
to convince information
this, take a break

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.025
For the level of trust
down to b then equal

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.061
with the first stage of
high risk bonds

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:20.041
That means South Korean currency
will soon mean nothing

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:24.009
This information will hopefully help
you are negotiating

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.088
Just make it crazy /
a lot of bill checks

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.225
issued by the system
integrated finance

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:48.265
No matter the small company
or big, where possible

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.171
not related to
integrated financial body

01:16:56.112 --> 01:17:00.174
Sir, in this case a big company
This little one won't be helped

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:04.176
again, isn't that so, then from
it's better to keep going forward

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:08.148
However, South Korea
will depend on the company

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:11.024
big, just accept the terms
closure of an integrated financial body

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.025
In the future we can go through
government policy

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:16.123
towards integrated finance
and large companies

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:18.022
To do an innocent act

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:22.263
How can
Bankrupt the bill check

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:26.003
already valid, no
held accountable

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:44.250
Sorry midnight call you
here / don't need to

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:48.222
But, time is like this
actually more suitable for us

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:10.086
For the level of trust
being b is the same

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.087
with the initial stage
high risk bonds

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:17.151
This information is expected to help
you to negotiate this

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:56.123
The last scheme f, after
get imf bailout,

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:59.253
immediately increase flexibility
in the Korean labor market

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.999
What do you mean by
flexibility is massive

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:07.265
/ not, but the recruiter
done in various ways

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:10.105
For example multiply
temporary workforce

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:12.040
or work ratio not
directly and others

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:16.001
Imf hope to turn on the market
workforce in south korea

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:18.241
/ meant from more life
is the use right

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:27.213
What did he say, chairman han
Don't talk anymore, Chairman Han

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:31.118
My han chief told you to sit down immediately

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:41.093
Deputy of the American Ministry of Finance
why in this hotel

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:45.040
This has no connection
with negotiations this time /

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.271
and why he and you
live on the same floor

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:53.138
Deputy Ministry of Finance
america and imf member

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:55.140
is preparing negotiations,
really like that

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:01.248
Deputy direct finance ministry
visit the home of a presidential candidate

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:04.226
and told them to sign
hands, really like that

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:09.222
Last week's interest rate
cause bumn bankrupt

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.135
Open the capitalist market, that way
will attract large foreign funds

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:15.265
And by buying it
massive bankruptcy

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:17.205
company, easily
purchased by foreign funds

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:21.041
I am a policy team
bank of korea currency

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:24.146
I can't accept the scheme
negotiations like this,

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:26.115
moreover I have a reason
like this to doubt

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:31.145
You behind have been ordered
by the American government

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:37.049
Explain to us why
Imf help conditions

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:40.187
it must be massive
towards employees

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:46.191
Why govern the capital market
opened wide

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:51.997
What can America get
the benefits of negotiations

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.236
between imf and korea, what
this is just my prejudice

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:04.053
You are the responsible
negotiation is correct

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:08.086
So it's very easy

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.255
Life is accumulation
same with negotiations,

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:14.196
then we will
add one more prerequisite

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:19.126
If you want this negotiation
done and I go or

01:22:19.168 --> 01:22:22.195
so tell someone who
refused to negotiate away

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:28.039
This is the third prerequisite

01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:36.049
Sir, please cancel this negotiation /
there are people who are pretentious like you

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:40.017
Are there arrogant people like you

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:46.185
Go there, don't be embarrassed
/ Where do you come from

01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:53.226
This negotiation is invalid, sir
please stop this negotiation

01:22:57.239 --> 01:23:02.234
I believe this negotiation will end
Sir / Sir, please stop immediately

01:23:06.248 --> 01:23:08.240
Don't care if you rebel like
what, the results will not change

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:12.219
Han Seohyun

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:18.221
Will not change, you rebel
like anything will not change

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.039
Kamsoo

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:42.074
Exchange rates rose, raw materials rose by two
fold, secured loans

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:48.217
Cannot cover needs
the cost of our raw materials is half

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.998
Oh yeah Kamsoo, where do you check the bill
given by pak lee

01:23:57.165 --> 01:24:00.966
At least the bill can be cashed
to help with emergencies

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:07.004
Mr. Lee / yes

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:12.214
They are logistics companies

01:24:15.284 --> 01:24:20.188
It's closed / then how
with our bill check

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:25.992
It has become useless paper

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.129
My house is there ...

01:24:34.136 --> 01:24:39.234
How about my wife
and my children there

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:32.127
Mr. Jun, I'm Kamsoo

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:36.164
Sir, lately
very difficult / little

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:41.298
You also have trouble right
/ Don't bring up again

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:44.263
Boss han, we have to
more uplifting, ok

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:46.207
endure to the end
will definitely win

01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:49.102
Well, yes, it just has to be like that

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:56.208
I will continue to survive, me
it will last, oh yeah boss

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:03.122
I will return the money to
you / really, are you there

01:26:05.127 --> 01:26:11.089
I give you money, you send
one person came here to take it

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:38.249
This house is pretty good

01:26:41.997 --> 01:26:43.056
The room is also a brush

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:58.213
People, there are people, go quickly leave

01:27:03.185 --> 01:27:05.177
Why what, hurry to report the police

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:14.254
Why do I have to go out now
this house has become mine

01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:30.169
Establish and apply
monetary credit policy

01:27:32.147 --> 01:27:34.207
Contributing to
national economic development

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:42.149
The initial intention of establishing the bank of Korea

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.227
All have forgotten

01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:54.033
We are people
get a salary from the country

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.070
Let's contribute to
national economic development

01:28:04.146 --> 01:28:07.173
We must interrupt
negotiations for immediate

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:11.050
stopped, then immediately
announce bankrupt countries

01:28:12.087 --> 01:28:16.115
Announce payment suspension,
and then recognize the bankrupt state

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:20.018
Once announced debt
suspended, all

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:21.997
payment obligation
will be temporarily lost

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:26.092
No, even though it is
but if suspended /

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:28.160
what do you think is the most
feared by creditors

01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:32.233
Finally what can
done by one

01:28:32.274 --> 01:28:34.038
forced debtor
and helpless

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:38.103
We can take advantage of imf weaknesses
which speaks for American interests

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:40.238
Instead of negotiating like
it's better to announce bankruptcy

01:28:41.216 --> 01:28:43.276
Money borrowed from America
can't pay it

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:49.215
Depending on the suspension of payment
may change the attitude of negotiating imf

01:28:49.291 --> 01:28:54.195
Don't, don't care about doing
debt deferral and

01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:59.258
announced bankruptcy but chairman
who proposed this method

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.206
You will be fired

01:29:12.147 --> 01:29:14.048
That is not important

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:18.280
We only have one more card

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:41.059
Poor people are getting poorer,
rich people will get richer

01:30:42.304 --> 01:30:45.103
Phk will be easier, employees
not always will be more

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:48.008
a lot, losing a job
will be like everyday food

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:53.241
We must not allow imf to make it
Korea is a country like that

01:30:55.150 --> 01:30:57.984
So it's actually the government
already know the end of

01:30:58.019 --> 01:31:00.079
what crisis but not
tell the people

01:31:00.155 --> 01:31:03.216
Yes, let alone talk for
announced, instead it was busy covering up

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:08.161
Is negotiating with imf too
ongoing / yes right

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:13.099
Imf use the prerequisites for
provide irrelevant requests

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:16.238
Phk is massive, interest rates,
employee, investment and others

01:31:16.271 --> 01:31:19.070
reform all aspects
the community is in a closed room

01:31:21.076 --> 01:31:24.274
And there are some people who control
is running without a hitch

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:29.048
Until now there was none
one from the government

01:31:29.084 --> 01:31:31.144
who is carrying out
the task according to which is carried out

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:36.181
There is no thought to help
country that is in danger

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:40.218
Even based on
thoughts and statements

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:44.062
personal determines the period
front of the country and the people

01:31:47.102 --> 01:31:51.267
During history, facing a crisis
the worst economy in front

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:55.210
Until the end

01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:12.185
There isn't one newspaper
which makes it beriita

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:23.129
It's too much

01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:30.135
Imf bailout negotiations have been successful

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:33.243
We finally get funding
economic bailout of $ 55 billion dollars

01:32:34.082 --> 01:32:38.019
But it also means the economy
Korea is controlled by IMF

01:32:38.253 --> 01:32:42.020
Even though you don't want to
humble yourself, but day

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:45.118
this can be referred to as
national embarrassing day

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:52.156
Today's lesson is very special,
our children see this video for a while

01:32:54.102 --> 01:33:00.099
What can you give?
on the country, ok / good

01:33:01.009 --> 01:33:03.137
Save water, save electricity,
tapering pencil should be

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:05.204
use a knife, don't eat
too much fruit

01:33:06.014 --> 01:33:10.076
In the IMF system, expect
the salary will go down 15  /   

01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:13.020
Imf also filed for
raise interest rates

01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:15.989
The economic sector is in a hurricane
against structural adjustment

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:18.219
Entrepreneurs are due
pressure from government officials held a demonstration

01:33:18.293 --> 01:33:21.058
The big one has become
the last one outlined

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:24.232
Unfortunately, all of you
get a letter of intention to resign

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:28.102
This letter's signature means
agreed to resign

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:31.072
yourself / what do you understand
regarding non-permanent employees

01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:32.266
What exactly do you mean?
from no employee

01:33:32.307 --> 01:33:34.208
still ... / willing to be
temporary employee

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:46.050
Why do you suddenly kill yourself / work partners
not giving money, filing for bankruptcy

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:48.249
Filing for bankruptcy must have been devastated

01:33:51.059 --> 01:33:53.028
Say you need money then
believe in others,

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:55.087
apparently filed for bankruptcy,
then don't know finally

01:33:56.231 --> 01:34:02.171
After removing the whole family
then hang yourself in jail / god ..

01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:15.114
Mr. Yoon, I know you
definitely can / lucky

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:18.120
you believe it then
I can be like this

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:22.018
Don't say that, you bring
us, we just follow you

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:32.057
Wow this song is too high, come on
here out / out, out

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:38.073
No, no I don't
get out / fast exit

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:43.267
Get out quickly

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:59.200
Very tired

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:03.260
It should not look for imf

01:39:06.174 --> 01:39:08.234
Do you know what
happened with Thailand,

01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:11.110
Indonesia after getting it
bailout from imf

01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:18.177
Making a mistake should be
receive punishment, but

01:39:18.219 --> 01:39:21.189
they made a mistake
immediately sentenced to death

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:30.027
We certainly still have a way to
fight, but the chairman like this ...

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:38.139
Come on out, the rice is cold

01:40:35.263 --> 01:40:38.062
Sis / seohyun

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:43.170
You must be very busy right / why you

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:51.009
Come to my office, is there something

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:04.088
Brother wants your help
visit: NFS31.XYZ

01:41:06.294 --> 01:41:11.198
Seohyun, you know a lot
the leader of the bank right

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:17.071
Sorry, can you help brother just this once

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:23.010
Help brother to borrow money

01:41:26.047 --> 01:41:27.174
I can only find you now

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:32.049
It's okay if I'm arrested

01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:38.116
But what about brother
your brother-in-law and children

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:48.034
Help brother to borrow
money, just this time

01:41:51.072 --> 01:41:52.005

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:57.006
Seohyun, I'm begging you

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:09.109
The crisis will continue to repeat itself, repeatedly

01:44:10.144 --> 01:44:12.238
Have you felt in these 20 years
South Korean society has changed a lot

01:44:15.116 --> 01:44:22.080
Does not change at all, no, instead
hiding a growing crisis

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:28.187
Mr. Yoon, sir Yoon, a lot of me
get what you talked about earlier

01:44:29.063 --> 01:44:32.227
If you have my time
want to treat you to eat

01:44:35.136 --> 01:44:39.005
Lunch is 5 million won,
dinner 10 million won

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.075
1 hour lunch, dinner
1.5 hours, acc number is here

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:51.985
But a crisis is an opportunity

01:44:53.254 --> 01:44:57.021
Meaning is an opportunity for
changing fate will also increase

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.195
Sir, you are coming

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:09.169
Early in the morning give a nice meal

01:45:10.204 --> 01:45:13.197
America continues to do something
against chong funds and mixed funds

01:45:15.176 --> 01:45:17.236
How should you continue to follow

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:24.278
Of course, it must be followed / good

01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:31.083

Pa, I'm leaving

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:50.169
Well, you remember hyunsoo
what always pleases

01:45:50.211 --> 01:45:53.147
/ yes, don't believe in
good person to you

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:57.108
No, no, not don't believe
to someone who is good to you,

01:45:57.151 --> 01:46:00.144
don't trust anyone,
just believe in yourself

01:46:01.255 --> 01:46:06.057
Just believe in yourself /
OK, I'll call you again later

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:12.098
Tasan, tasan, I said
fast work

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:18.062

Later he heard a lot of people
refused, said he wanted reform

01:46:47.101 --> 01:46:52.096
What else should you do, just follow, then
it will be calm again this country

01:46:55.276 --> 01:46:56.244
Have you ever heard

01:47:01.215 --> 01:47:02.205
Lately ...

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.207
He said his personality was unusual

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:38.176
This is an emergency, no
need to consider important matter

01:47:38.218 --> 01:47:39.277
personality, do what is
just have to do enough

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:50.025

Have me come to your place
to enjoy old age

01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:22.194
Why

01:48:28.202 --> 01:48:31.070
This is a prediction in one year
this, family debt reports soared

01:48:31.305 --> 01:48:33.206
This is property
unsold

01:48:33.207 --> 01:48:35.176
around the seoul
appears as a precursor

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:37.972
There are no precautions at all

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:42.080
I've seen a report book
what you wrote, imf report

01:48:42.116 --> 01:48:44.176
that you left when you
leave the bank of korea

01:48:45.219 --> 01:48:47.188
That is the only book
the most correct report

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:52.020
Senior, mhon to seniors to help us

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:57.254
The bomb in front of the eyes is counting down
time, but everyone just kept quiet

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:09.004
I need my team

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:14.274
The crisis continues,
for the sake of not entering again

01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:17.079
into a crisis, don't
until I forget it

01:49:19.053 --> 01:49:21.045
Must continue to doubt, keep thinking

01:49:24.191 --> 01:49:26.217
Does not teach things
that seems reasonable

01:49:29.163 --> 01:49:38.266
And you have to keep your eyes open to see
world, this time I don't want to lose again

01:49:39.305 --> 01:49:45.212
