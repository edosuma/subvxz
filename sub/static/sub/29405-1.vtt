WEBVTT

00:03.610 --> 00:05.888
We're not sure where this chase started,

00:05.891 --> 00:07.106
but the vehicle is currently

00:07.109 --> 00:09.056
moving west on the 710 freeway.

00:09.059 --> 00:10.772
Whoa, that was close!

00:10.775 --> 00:13.293
I count four LAPD vehicles in pursuit.

00:13.296 --> 00:15.966
He's got to be going at
least 100 miles an hour.

00:15.968 --> 00:19.002
105 in a 65 mile an hour zone.

00:19.004 --> 00:20.755
He passed me about three miles back.

00:20.758 --> 00:21.805
Is the suspect male?

00:21.807 --> 00:23.907
The suspect was a blur.

00:23.909 --> 00:24.893
Could you tell if there was anyone else

00:24.895 --> 00:25.755
in the vehicle?

00:25.758 --> 00:27.537
The only way we're gonna
see who's in that car

00:27.539 --> 00:29.739
is if we get a whole lot closer.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.700
_

00:34.076 --> 00:36.537
_

00:36.587 --> 00:40.268
_

00:40.541 --> 00:42.223
_

00:42.226 --> 00:44.473
I'm sorry, did you say you're in the car

00:44.476 --> 00:46.206
that the police are chasing?

00:46.209 --> 00:48.663
Yeah, I'm the driver.
The police are chasing me!

00:50.768 --> 00:51.968
What's your name?

00:51.970 --> 00:53.644
It's Tony. Tony Bryson.

00:53.647 --> 00:56.656
Okay, Tony, I'm Maddie. Can
you tell me what's going on

00:56.659 --> 00:58.540
and why you won't pull
over for the police?

00:58.542 --> 01:00.542
Because I can't! The
gear shifter thing broke

01:00.544 --> 01:02.057
and now, it just keeps speeding up.

01:02.060 --> 01:04.735
I can't stop the car. Please help!

01:09.557 --> 01:11.557
You think the kid's telling the truth?

01:11.560 --> 01:13.854
I think children, as a
rule, are pathological liars.

01:13.857 --> 01:15.090
So who knows?

01:15.092 --> 01:16.713
But this one seems pretty scared.

01:16.716 --> 01:18.139
15 years old, he probably

01:18.142 --> 01:19.958
doesn't even have his learner's permit.

01:21.336 --> 01:23.970
All right, send me
every unit you can spare.

01:23.973 --> 01:26.001
We're gonna need to
shut down this freeway.

01:28.372 --> 01:31.006
Tony, what's your speed right now?

01:31.008 --> 01:33.509
100, 105.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.457
And your foot isn't on the gas pedal?

01:35.460 --> 01:36.844
No, I'm not touching it at all.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.213
It's like the car's possessed.

01:38.215 --> 01:39.914
It's like I knew I wasn't
supposed to be driving it

01:39.916 --> 01:41.456
and it's punishing me.

01:41.459 --> 01:43.189
Okay, and you've tried using the brake?

01:43.192 --> 01:44.786
It didn't work. The car wouldn't stop.

01:44.788 --> 01:47.022
It started shaking real, real bad.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.024
I thought I was gonna crash.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.793
There's no way that you can
shift the car into neutral?

01:51.795 --> 01:53.595
I'm trying. I can't get it into gear.

01:53.598 --> 01:55.119
Please help me. I can't hurt the car.

01:55.122 --> 01:57.032
Hey, the car is not important right now.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.720
- Only you are.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:58.723 --> 02:00.602
My dad will kill me if
anything happens to this car.

02:00.604 --> 02:02.104
Okay, I don't think that's true.

02:02.106 --> 02:03.800
No, he loves it more than anything.

02:03.803 --> 02:04.706
More than me. Like, no one's

02:04.708 --> 02:05.707
supposed to drive it.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.408
He doesn't even drive it.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.610
He just sits in it
listening to Phil Collins.

02:09.612 --> 02:11.913
Okay, Tony, I'm sure that your father...

02:11.915 --> 02:14.415
You have to find another way!

02:14.417 --> 02:16.068
I think he's getting tired.

02:16.071 --> 02:18.052
We may have even less
time than we thought.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.433
Isn't there any other way to stop him?

02:19.435 --> 02:21.488
He's going too fast for a PIT maneuver.

02:21.491 --> 02:23.780
We could try spike
strips, but if those tires

02:23.783 --> 02:25.961
don't hit just right,
he could lose control.

02:25.964 --> 02:28.531
- Flip the car.
- The convertible.

02:28.534 --> 02:31.065
Um, maybe if he aimed for the strips?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.531
An inexperienced driver

02:32.534 --> 02:34.133
in a car doing triple digits?

02:34.136 --> 02:36.770
There's no way he could
hit a target that small.

02:38.274 --> 02:40.941
But he could probably
hit something bigger.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.110
Kid's car is moving like
a runaway freight train,

02:43.112 --> 02:45.366
but they got a plan to slow
him down before he crashes.

02:45.369 --> 02:48.481
- So we're on cleanup duty?
- Not exactly.

02:48.484 --> 02:49.668
Are you insane?

02:49.671 --> 02:54.039
That car is a 1970
Ferrari Daytona Spider!

02:54.042 --> 02:55.525
And if he so much as
puts a scratch on it,

02:55.527 --> 02:56.497
I swear to God, I...

02:56.500 --> 02:58.587
Tony is already more
afraid of hurting that car

02:58.590 --> 03:00.390
than he is of hurting himself.

03:00.393 --> 03:02.670
Partially because he is
15, but mostly because

03:02.673 --> 03:04.639
he thinks you love
that car more than him.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.547
Of course I... he doesn't...

03:07.550 --> 03:09.435
he didn't actually say that, did he?

03:09.438 --> 03:11.070
Yes, he did.

03:11.072 --> 03:13.540
Now, please, I need you to talk to him

03:13.543 --> 03:16.870
and tell him he's wrong,
and I need him to believe it.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.496
- Okay.
- We got a cruiser

03:19.499 --> 03:20.476
coming to you now.

03:20.479 --> 03:21.981
He's here, he's here.

03:25.286 --> 03:26.901
Maddie, you still there?

03:26.904 --> 03:28.562
Maddie, what's going on? Where are you?

03:28.565 --> 03:29.898
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here.

03:29.901 --> 03:31.124
The police are slowing down.

03:31.126 --> 03:32.491
Why? What's happening?

03:32.493 --> 03:34.526
- Tony, can you hear me?
- Dad?

03:34.529 --> 03:36.712
Oh, God, Dad, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

03:36.715 --> 03:38.964
- I really screwed up.
- No, no, it... it... it...

03:38.967 --> 03:40.432
it's fine, son.

03:40.435 --> 03:42.736
- You're not mad?
- Of course not.

03:42.739 --> 03:44.873
It could happen to anybody, right?

03:44.876 --> 03:47.705
Why aren't you mad? You love this car.

03:47.708 --> 03:49.859
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do love the car.

03:49.862 --> 03:52.510
I mean, it is a one-of-a-kind car, Tony.

03:52.513 --> 03:56.315
But I mean, you're a
one-of-a-kind kid, too, right?

03:56.317 --> 03:58.984
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!
- What?

03:58.986 --> 04:00.318
That's why you're doing this.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.727
You're just pretending not to be mad.

04:01.729 --> 04:04.092
- I told you I'm not mad!
- No, you're totally mad!

04:04.095 --> 04:05.560
I know it! You're just not yelling at me

04:05.562 --> 04:06.881
because you don't want
our last words to be...

04:06.883 --> 04:08.459
- That is not...
- I just took the car

04:08.462 --> 04:09.386
to show my friends.

04:09.389 --> 04:10.989
Like, they didn't believe
that some stick in the mud

04:10.991 --> 04:12.359
- could have such a cool car...
- Stick in the mud?

04:12.361 --> 04:13.315
It was just supposed to be fun

04:13.317 --> 04:15.400
and now, I'm... I'm gonna die.

04:15.403 --> 04:19.404
You're not gonna die, okay?

04:19.406 --> 04:22.174
I may wring your neck
once I know you're safe.

04:22.176 --> 04:23.680
So please, just shut up and listen to me

04:23.682 --> 04:25.177
for a second, all right?

04:25.179 --> 04:26.463
The car doesn't matter, okay?

04:26.466 --> 04:28.991
None of it matters, Tony.

04:28.994 --> 04:32.183
All that matters is that you
get out of there in one piece.

04:32.186 --> 04:34.698
That's all that I care about.

04:34.701 --> 04:37.354
Maddie says she has
a way to stop the car.

04:37.357 --> 04:40.025
I need you need to listen to her

04:40.027 --> 04:43.028
and then do exactly what she says, okay?

04:43.030 --> 04:45.197
Okay. What do I do?

04:45.199 --> 04:48.266
Okay, there's an exit coming up.

04:48.268 --> 04:50.318
They're clearing a
stretch of Woodley Avenue.

04:50.321 --> 04:52.003
We'll meet them there.

04:52.005 --> 04:55.136
- How fast is he going?
- 105.

04:55.139 --> 04:57.208
Once he gets to Woodley
Avenue, he'll hit the brakes,

04:57.210 --> 04:59.210
hope he slows down a little.

04:59.212 --> 05:02.079
- And that's where we come in.
- That's a vintage car.

05:02.081 --> 05:04.215
You worried about
damaging a classic, Chim?

05:04.217 --> 05:05.555
I'm worried about damaging a kid.

05:05.558 --> 05:07.450
Airbags weren't standard until the '80s.

05:07.453 --> 05:10.221
A car that old, we're lucky
it has a shoulder harness.

05:10.223 --> 05:12.756
But if they can get
it down to 60 or 70...

05:12.758 --> 05:15.226
I like his chances better.

05:15.228 --> 05:18.262
What kind of crazy person
came up with this plan?

05:18.264 --> 05:20.231
My wife.

05:25.471 --> 05:27.238
I see him. He's taking the exit.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.874
Kid's on the move.

05:30.876 --> 05:33.535
Is everyone in position?

05:33.538 --> 05:36.706
Bobby, are you ready?

05:36.709 --> 05:38.848
I'm getting in position
on Woodley Avenue.

05:40.418 --> 05:42.252
All right, Maddie, we're ready.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.210
Let's do this.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.256
- Are you ready, Tony?
- Yeah, hitting the breaks now.

05:47.259 --> 05:50.260
Remember, constant
pressure. Don't pump them.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.002
Slowing down.

05:52.005 --> 05:54.005
It's shaking again. I don't like this.

05:54.008 --> 05:55.875
No, no, no, that's okay.
That's okay, it's gonna shake.

05:55.877 --> 05:56.840
Just stay on the brakes.

05:56.843 --> 05:58.134
Keep the wheel straight.

05:58.136 --> 06:00.469
What's your speed?

06:00.471 --> 06:04.507
95, 90, 85.

06:04.509 --> 06:05.966
80.

06:05.969 --> 06:08.970
It's not going any lower.

06:08.973 --> 06:10.308
Oh, my God, there's a fire truck!

06:10.311 --> 06:11.776
What do I do? Do I go around it?

06:11.779 --> 06:13.246
Keep going straight.

06:13.249 --> 06:14.512
Stay right behind the truck.

06:14.515 --> 06:17.025
Do you know where the
emergency brake is?

06:17.028 --> 06:18.586
Uh, yeah.

06:20.436 --> 06:22.525
Oh, the truck's slowing
down. It's getting real close.

06:22.527 --> 06:25.193
Good, now pull the parking
brake and hit that truck.

06:25.195 --> 06:26.995
- What?
- Hit the truck!

06:54.325 --> 06:58.726
Help, hey, help!

07:08.299 --> 07:12.368
We got him, Cap.

07:16.652 --> 07:18.382
Getting the dry chem, Cap!

07:18.385 --> 07:20.347
Tony!

07:20.350 --> 07:21.813
- Dad?
- Is he okay?

07:21.816 --> 07:24.351
Broken nose, a possible concussion.

07:24.354 --> 07:25.803
Or he hit the steering wheel.

07:25.806 --> 07:27.355
Was it just your head or your chest too?

07:27.357 --> 07:29.139
Head.

07:29.142 --> 07:31.041
I'm not seeing any
signs of chest trauma.

07:31.044 --> 07:32.859
They'll do scans at the
hospital just in case.

07:32.862 --> 07:33.893
Buddy, it's gonna be okay.

07:33.895 --> 07:35.129
They're gonna take you to the hospital.

07:35.131 --> 07:36.364
You'll be all right, okay?

07:36.366 --> 07:38.365
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- It's all right.

07:38.367 --> 07:39.865
It's just a car.

07:49.544 --> 07:51.064
There'll be an investigation

07:51.067 --> 07:53.613
to determine what caused
the car to malfunction.

07:53.615 --> 07:55.548
I'd call it a loose clutch.

07:55.550 --> 07:58.202
Looks like the gear shift
broke clean off under the boot.

07:58.205 --> 07:59.752
Throttle must have
gotten stuck wide open

07:59.754 --> 08:01.054
from the linkage break.

08:01.056 --> 08:02.605
Wait, how's the car? Can it be fixed?

08:02.608 --> 08:04.391
Here, something to remember it by.

08:04.393 --> 08:06.535
You know, I heard there's a Testerossa

08:06.538 --> 08:08.015
coming up for auction soon.

08:08.018 --> 08:09.396
What do you say we get that instead?

08:09.398 --> 08:10.696
Does it have airbags?

08:16.102 --> 08:17.634
Kids today.

08:39.438 --> 08:41.038
Martinez!

08:42.408 --> 08:44.374
I got them.

08:54.353 --> 08:57.320
I got her. Headed down.

09:19.544 --> 09:22.344
Baby doll factory, new record.

09:22.346 --> 09:26.015
Most guys take the stairs.
Welcome back, Buckley.

09:34.859 --> 09:36.713
We're not late, are we?

09:37.987 --> 09:39.738
The guest of honor hasn't arrived yet.

09:39.741 --> 09:41.427
I'd hate to miss an opportunity to cry.

09:41.430 --> 09:42.631
Yeah.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.433
Are the IVF shots taking their toll?

09:44.435 --> 09:46.490
I feel like a human pin cushion.

09:46.493 --> 09:47.669
A very weepy pin cushion.

09:49.607 --> 09:53.797
So first official party at
the Grant-Nash household.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.043
- Oh.
- I didn't think it was

09:55.045 --> 09:56.412
gonna really happen.

09:56.414 --> 09:58.414
Or that any of us would be invited.

09:58.416 --> 10:00.097
See, here you go again.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.951
I told you don't take it personally.

10:02.953 --> 10:04.386
Then don't take it personally

10:04.388 --> 10:06.255
that I ain't getting you guys no gift.

10:06.257 --> 10:10.626
- And they're almost here.
- And we are almost ready.

10:10.628 --> 10:13.194
Sorry, Bobby, no sign
of any other platters.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.490
I saw your mom put
some stuff in the shed.

10:14.492 --> 10:16.463
Maybe check in there.

10:16.466 --> 10:19.300
Come on in, he's here.

10:28.411 --> 10:31.579
Surprise!

10:31.581 --> 10:33.648
Aw!

10:33.650 --> 10:35.283
- Did you do this?
- Yeah.

10:48.430 --> 10:52.332
Wow, thanks, buddy. Wow. This is great.

10:52.334 --> 10:55.135
- It's you and me.
- Oh, and what's that?

10:55.137 --> 10:57.732
- It's a surfboard, right?
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.

10:57.735 --> 10:59.439
He's obsessed, yeah.

10:59.441 --> 11:03.477
"Dear Buck, you are
an awesome firefighter.

11:03.479 --> 11:05.479
Love, Christopher."

11:05.481 --> 11:07.814
Very sweet, Christopher. Thank you.

11:09.951 --> 11:11.485
All right, thank you.

11:13.922 --> 11:16.523
Ooh, so that's your future baby daddy.

11:16.525 --> 11:19.217
Looks a little young.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.994
No, this photo is, like, 20 years old.

11:21.997 --> 11:23.587
For privacy reasons, they can't

11:23.590 --> 11:24.998
show you what he looks like now.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.567
Yeah, and he's not a baby daddy.

11:27.569 --> 11:29.769
He's a sperm donor.

11:29.771 --> 11:32.643
Well, he is a cute sperm donor.

11:32.646 --> 11:33.873
- Mm-hmm.
- And hey.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.709
He's gonna make for a real cute kid.

11:37.713 --> 11:40.947
- You are so sweet.
- I...

11:40.949 --> 11:42.381
- Oh, oh, God.
- Hold me.

11:42.383 --> 11:44.684
Ah...

11:56.197 --> 11:58.762
Yo, I can't believe you
managed to keep this a secret.

11:58.765 --> 12:00.733
There's cake?

12:00.735 --> 12:02.233
- Uh, two cakes.
- Yeah.

12:02.236 --> 12:03.972
We weren't sure how today was gonna go.

12:03.975 --> 12:05.307
So we had another one on standby

12:05.310 --> 12:06.972
in case you crashed and burned that said

12:06.974 --> 12:08.291
"better Buck next time."

12:08.294 --> 12:09.842
Aw.

12:09.844 --> 12:12.410
Wow, you guys just gonna
get married already?

12:12.412 --> 12:14.546
Oh, don't forget to invite us.

12:16.617 --> 12:19.972
- Okay.
- Hey, right?

12:19.975 --> 12:21.920
They are sending me the
paperwork in the morning

12:21.922 --> 12:23.555
and you will officially be back.

12:23.557 --> 12:25.557
- How's that feel?
- Oh, I'm just glad it's over.

12:25.559 --> 12:29.160
You know, I hated not
being with you guys.

12:29.162 --> 12:31.202
Yeah, we missed you too.

12:31.205 --> 12:33.334
It'll be nice to have the
whole team back together.

12:33.337 --> 12:36.644
Thanks, Cap. And I don't just mean

12:36.647 --> 12:38.304
for the party and the cakes. Um...

12:41.575 --> 12:43.207
Thank you for being there,

12:43.209 --> 12:45.755
you know, for the
surgeries and the rehabs.

12:45.758 --> 12:47.131
I, uh...

12:47.134 --> 12:49.195
I know I wasn't always the
easiest person to be around.

12:49.197 --> 12:50.348
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, really?

12:50.350 --> 12:52.610
- No, you weren't that bad.
- You should...

12:55.756 --> 12:57.589
Ex-girlfriend, sorry.

12:57.591 --> 12:58.956
Hey, she just wasn't the right fit.

12:58.958 --> 13:00.826
- You'll find someone new.
- Sorry, I, uh...

13:00.829 --> 13:01.959
You okay?

13:03.496 --> 13:04.595
Yeah, I...

13:11.470 --> 13:13.171
Buck?

13:15.474 --> 13:17.254
Buck?

13:18.676 --> 13:20.828
_

13:24.742 --> 13:26.059
You got lucky.

13:26.062 --> 13:27.218
Most peaple who suffer

13:27.221 --> 13:28.999
a pulmonary embolism
don't do it surrounded

13:29.002 --> 13:31.611
by trained medical professionals.

13:31.613 --> 13:32.879
It saved your life.

13:32.881 --> 13:34.614
So what caused the blood clot?

13:34.616 --> 13:36.116
Clots, plural.

13:36.118 --> 13:37.919
There's the one that hit his lungs,

13:37.922 --> 13:39.619
and then there's two more in his leg.

13:39.621 --> 13:41.388
As to the cause? It's unclear.

13:41.390 --> 13:44.124
Yeah, but he just got a clean
bill of health last week.

13:44.126 --> 13:46.887
- This came out of nowhere.
- Did it?

13:46.890 --> 13:48.694
No pain or tenderness in the leg?

13:48.696 --> 13:50.696
Skin discoloration, swelling?

13:50.698 --> 13:53.833
I thought I just pulled
a muscle or something.

13:53.835 --> 13:57.855
Okay, I-I've been training for
my LAFD recertification test.

13:57.858 --> 13:59.205
Well, it's not surprising.

13:59.207 --> 14:00.873
Training hard can lead to dehydration,

14:00.875 --> 14:03.343
which can increase the risk of clots.

14:03.345 --> 14:06.145
Okay, um, well, great.
Look, I'm not dead.

14:06.147 --> 14:09.182
You found the clots. When
can I get out of here?

14:09.184 --> 14:10.792
We'll move you to a room.

14:10.795 --> 14:12.817
Keep you on the anticoagulants.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.454
Tomorrow, we'll run some more tests.

14:15.457 --> 14:18.325
And then, we'll see.

14:18.328 --> 14:19.558
Thanks, Doc.

14:22.268 --> 14:24.662
You know what, I'm gonna go
tell everyone that you're okay.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.704
Let them know that you're
staying awhile, all right?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.872
When did your leg start bothering you?

14:33.874 --> 14:36.508
Like a day or two ago.

14:36.510 --> 14:39.067
Maddie, I-I was not
ignoring this, okay?

14:39.070 --> 14:40.678
I-I didn't know what it was.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.447
I thought I had a leg
cramp or something.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.349
Yeah, well, you need to be more careful.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.585
Because if this had
happened when you were alone,

14:47.587 --> 14:48.905
you could have died.

14:48.908 --> 14:51.689
But I... I didn't, okay?
I just passed out...

14:51.691 --> 14:54.258
Yeah, just passed out
after vomiting up blood.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.693
What?

14:56.695 --> 14:59.696
I don't... I don't remember
that. I vomited up blood?

15:01.167 --> 15:04.635
- At Bobby and Athena's house?
- Yeah.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.605
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.850
Oh, Michael brought
the kids to his place.

15:13.853 --> 15:15.345
He's gonna keep them tonight.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.946
Did he say how they're doing?

15:16.949 --> 15:19.320
Well, May's been quiet,

15:19.323 --> 15:22.631
and Harry keeps asking if
we're sure it's not Ebola.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.524
Well, so much for our first
party as a married couple.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.725
Mm, well, maybe now
they'll all stop complaining

15:29.727 --> 15:31.727
that we didn't have a wedding reception.

15:34.299 --> 15:36.899
- Where should we start?
- Right here.

15:40.572 --> 15:42.305
Buck says that he is
sorry about the blood

15:42.307 --> 15:43.806
and hopes he didn't ruin anything.

15:43.808 --> 15:45.871
Oh, I raised two kids in this house.

15:45.874 --> 15:48.544
A little ammonia,
everything will be fine.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.313
Just glad he's okay.

15:50.315 --> 15:53.049
He is okay, right?

15:53.051 --> 15:55.461
Oh, he was laser-focused
on coming back to work,

15:55.464 --> 15:56.652
and I thought he was ready.

15:56.654 --> 15:58.388
But now, I have to wonder.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.224
Mm, you're worried that he's
pushing himself too hard?

16:02.226 --> 16:04.759
Yeah.

16:04.761 --> 16:06.528
That's what I did.
Thought I could handle it.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.163
Lied to everybody. Ignored the pain.

16:08.165 --> 16:10.265
I don't want him making the
same mistakes that I did.

16:10.267 --> 16:12.734
The job means a lot, but it
shouldn't mean everything.

16:12.736 --> 16:14.603
He's got to learn that.

16:14.605 --> 16:18.307
Yeah, well, I understand the impulse.

16:18.309 --> 16:20.742
Whenever I think of Harry and
May about to take a stumble,

16:20.744 --> 16:22.496
my instinct is to throw myself

16:22.499 --> 16:24.745
in front of them, cushion the fall.

16:24.748 --> 16:27.616
- Well, Buck's not my kid.
- No.

16:27.618 --> 16:30.752
But he's also not you.

16:30.754 --> 16:33.193
Maybe he's making the
same mistakes you did.

16:33.196 --> 16:34.923
Maybe he's not.

16:34.925 --> 16:38.226
I mean, really, there's only
one way to find out for sure.

16:38.228 --> 16:39.760
Just wait and see.

16:39.762 --> 16:42.630
You got to let them grow up sometime.

16:45.769 --> 16:47.298
_

16:47.484 --> 16:51.176
_

16:51.177 --> 16:53.273
_

16:55.445 --> 16:58.246
Thank God, I wasn't sure that
they were gonna send anyone.

16:58.248 --> 17:01.949
- You the one who called?
- It's my dad, Jack.

17:01.951 --> 17:04.952
We came to have lunch with
him. He was acting weird.

17:04.954 --> 17:06.819
And then, Dave, that's my brother,

17:06.821 --> 17:10.290
he noticed something on his stomach.

17:10.291 --> 17:11.711
We tried to get a closer look,

17:11.714 --> 17:15.029
but he kicked us out
and locked the door.

17:15.031 --> 17:16.818
Finally! Our father is having

17:16.820 --> 17:18.594
a medical emergency behind a locked door

17:18.597 --> 17:21.267
that no one in this damn
place can seem to open.

17:23.806 --> 17:25.071
The lock's not the problem.

17:25.074 --> 17:26.409
There's something on the other side

17:26.411 --> 17:27.550
keeping it from opening.

17:27.553 --> 17:29.069
Your sister said that you saw something

17:29.071 --> 17:30.349
on your father's stomach.

17:30.352 --> 17:33.680
Uh, these marks. Like
wounds or maybe sores?

17:33.683 --> 17:36.183
It was hard to tell.

17:36.185 --> 17:39.286
Jack, this is LAFD. Will
you please let us in?

17:41.290 --> 17:44.411
Not until those ungrateful
vultures stop circling!

17:44.414 --> 17:45.625
- Dad.
- Hey.

17:45.627 --> 17:46.626
Ungrateful? Who does he think

17:46.628 --> 17:47.827
pays for this place?

17:47.829 --> 17:50.463
You sold my house to pay for it!

17:50.465 --> 17:53.032
Eddie, Chim, we're gonna have
to storm the Bastille here.

17:53.034 --> 17:55.202
- He's acting like a child.
- I am not.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.403
Storming the Bastille, Cap.

17:56.405 --> 17:58.004
Copy.

17:58.006 --> 18:00.840
He's old, Dave. And sad and lonely,

18:00.842 --> 18:02.842
living in this place,
knowing he's dying.

18:02.844 --> 18:04.377
Oh, wait, your father's ill?

18:05.909 --> 18:07.713
I didn't mean "dying"
dying. I just mean...

18:07.716 --> 18:09.849
You wish, you ungrateful brats.

18:09.851 --> 18:11.718
He is 82.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.653
And I'm as healthy as a horse.

18:13.655 --> 18:16.756
- And stubborn as a mule.
- Hey, I'm your father.

18:16.758 --> 18:18.858
You're not too old for
the back of my hand.

18:18.860 --> 18:21.098
Okay, well, then, come on
out here and try it, old man.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.863
My money's on you.

18:23.865 --> 18:26.866
Oh, for Pete's sake.

18:26.868 --> 18:29.435
Mm-mm, no. That's not a rash.

18:29.438 --> 18:30.524
Maybe MRSA.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.038
Have you been to a hospital recently?

18:32.040 --> 18:33.873
Ooh, that's the
flesh-eating thing, right?

18:33.875 --> 18:35.290
Oh, I'm gonna wash my hands.

18:35.293 --> 18:37.579
- It's not a MRSA.
- Oh, yeah?

18:37.582 --> 18:39.696
You sound pretty sure about that.

18:39.699 --> 18:42.380
- When did the symptoms start?
- A few weeks back.

18:42.383 --> 18:45.551
You know, I figured it would
go away on its own, like crabs.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.224
Fine, I'll look.

18:52.226 --> 18:53.892
Knock yourself out.

18:56.897 --> 19:00.132
- Oh, what is that?
- I don't know.

19:00.134 --> 19:01.900
Maybe donovanosis.

19:01.902 --> 19:04.770
Mm, well, there's something
you don't see every day.

19:04.772 --> 19:06.838
- Thank you.
- No, sir,

19:06.840 --> 19:09.241
it looks like you have
a flesh-eating STD.

19:09.243 --> 19:10.738
Don't thank me.

19:10.741 --> 19:13.100
What kind of an 82-year-old gets an STD?

19:13.103 --> 19:14.700
Actually happens more than you think.

19:14.703 --> 19:16.047
Chlamydia, syphilis,

19:16.049 --> 19:17.515
on the rise in people over 65.

19:17.517 --> 19:18.775
When I went off to college,

19:18.778 --> 19:20.918
you gave me a can of
mace and a box of condoms.

19:20.921 --> 19:22.487
Told me to always protect myself.

19:22.489 --> 19:23.922
So what the hell, Dad?

19:23.924 --> 19:25.078
What do you mean you got condoms?

19:25.080 --> 19:25.956
I just got the mace.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.951
I didn't think anybody'd have you.

19:27.954 --> 19:30.065
Oh, well, someone's
clearly been having you.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.461
Who is she?

19:31.463 --> 19:34.328
She is none of your damn business.

19:34.331 --> 19:36.167
Okay, sir, you're not
required to tell us,

19:36.169 --> 19:37.935
but you do have to tell
them at the hospital

19:37.937 --> 19:38.969
because she has to start a course

19:38.971 --> 19:41.005
of antibiotics immediately.

19:41.007 --> 19:44.308
Um, everyone? My father, Jack here,

19:44.310 --> 19:47.311
has a flesh-eating STD.

19:47.313 --> 19:49.613
So whomever he's been sleeping with

19:49.615 --> 19:50.779
should come to the hospital

19:50.782 --> 19:53.049
with us for immediate treatment.

19:53.052 --> 19:54.952
Hm?

19:58.757 --> 20:02.459
Okay, ma'am, please come with us.

20:07.466 --> 20:09.700
Oh.

20:09.702 --> 20:12.769
What if you slept with one of
the women that he slept with?

20:12.771 --> 20:14.938
You should probably get
that checked out too.

20:19.911 --> 20:22.445
What kind of a place is this?

20:22.448 --> 20:25.382
I can't even with you!

20:25.384 --> 20:27.651
You're supposed to be a role model.

20:27.653 --> 20:28.819
He is to some people.

20:28.821 --> 20:31.355
Kids today.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.003
Chief, what's going on?

20:49.677 --> 20:51.623
You sure it's okay to be
walking around like this?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.209
Yeah, they want me up and moving.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.579
You know, it's better for
the blood flow in my legs.

20:56.581 --> 20:58.848
Seriously, if I'm not being poked

20:58.850 --> 21:01.017
or they're not testing
me, they're making me walk.

21:01.019 --> 21:03.452
So all that testing, do
they have any theories yet

21:03.454 --> 21:05.188
as to what caused the clots?

21:05.190 --> 21:07.590
Not yet, but the meds are working.

21:07.592 --> 21:10.525
You know, they're gonna
send me home tonight.

21:10.527 --> 21:12.928
Oh, hey, um, do I need the hospital

21:12.930 --> 21:14.637
to sign some kind of form

21:14.640 --> 21:16.282
or anything, you know,
for the Department?

21:16.285 --> 21:17.499
My clearance?

21:17.501 --> 21:21.069
Um... but you're not...

21:21.071 --> 21:23.105
you're not cleared, Buck.

21:23.107 --> 21:24.406
Not yet.

21:26.043 --> 21:27.686
What... yeah... no...

21:27.689 --> 21:29.916
I-I passed my physical and
my recertification test.

21:29.919 --> 21:31.413
I've got everything I-I need.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.315
It's the blood thinners.

21:33.317 --> 21:35.802
Department is concerned
about liability issues,

21:35.805 --> 21:38.053
and since the doctors
haven't figured out

21:38.055 --> 21:40.055
what's causing the clots...

21:40.057 --> 21:42.624
Uh...

21:42.626 --> 21:44.826
I can't come back to work?

21:44.828 --> 21:46.563
Well, Buck, if we were out on a call

21:46.566 --> 21:47.767
and something happened to you...

21:47.769 --> 21:49.631
And then, I would have two paramedics

21:49.633 --> 21:50.865
standing next to me.

21:50.867 --> 21:52.254
I would be fine!

21:55.104 --> 21:58.573
Bobby, you... you know how
hard I have worked for this.

21:58.575 --> 22:00.141
They can't... they can't do this to me.

22:00.143 --> 22:02.209
You... you can't let
them take away my job.

22:02.211 --> 22:03.767
Hey, we're not.

22:03.770 --> 22:05.447
You were injured in the line of duty,

22:05.449 --> 22:07.752
and no one is forgetting that.

22:07.755 --> 22:09.511
Chief Alonzo thinks that in a few weeks,

22:09.514 --> 22:10.785
if you're doing okay on the meds,

22:10.787 --> 22:12.386
he can clear you for light duty.

22:17.393 --> 22:19.125
Light duty?

22:21.263 --> 22:23.263
Uh...

22:23.265 --> 22:27.768
- you mean like a desk job?
- Now, listen, Buck, I...

22:27.770 --> 22:30.804
Out there,

22:30.806 --> 22:33.786
in the world, helping people.

22:33.789 --> 22:35.181
That is where I belong.

22:35.184 --> 22:37.777
That is where I have spent five months

22:37.780 --> 22:41.414
fighting to get back to.

22:41.416 --> 22:44.184
And now, you're gonna
tell me I-I can't?

22:44.186 --> 22:47.688
Listen, Buck, I know this is
hard, but at least light...

22:47.690 --> 22:51.424
No, I don't want light duty, okay?

22:51.426 --> 22:53.726
And... and neither would you.

22:59.534 --> 23:04.471
No, they are not
putting me behind a desk.

23:12.667 --> 23:15.668
I quit.

23:29.490 --> 23:32.714
Maddie said Buck hasn't
left the apartment in a week.

23:32.717 --> 23:35.051
Yeah, she's tried to get
him to go out a couple times,

23:35.053 --> 23:36.773
but it's always, "Why
would I need to leave?

23:36.775 --> 23:38.054
Everyone delivers."

23:38.056 --> 23:40.422
He won't even take my calls.

23:40.424 --> 23:42.837
He's just sulking,
Cap. He'll get over it.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.860
Hey.

23:44.862 --> 23:47.163
I like to give Buck crap
as much as any of you lot,

23:47.166 --> 23:49.590
but this was a body blow, guys.

23:49.593 --> 23:51.436
The guy's allowed some time to mourn.

23:51.439 --> 23:52.980
The question is how much time.

23:52.983 --> 23:55.280
I mean, his daily routine
of walking from the bed

23:55.283 --> 23:56.344
to the couch and back again.

23:56.346 --> 23:57.706
That's not gonna help the situation.

23:57.708 --> 24:00.442
Look, I know it sucks,
but that's life, right?

24:00.444 --> 24:02.077
Whenever stuff didn't work out for me,

24:02.079 --> 24:03.654
my dad always told me to brush it off,

24:03.657 --> 24:05.113
keep moving forward.

24:05.115 --> 24:06.948
It wasn't easy but he wasn't wrong.

24:06.950 --> 24:08.651
But forward to what?

24:08.653 --> 24:10.319
I mean, we all had lives,

24:10.321 --> 24:12.087
jobs before we entered the Department.

24:12.089 --> 24:13.755
And we have things outside of it.

24:13.757 --> 24:19.094
- What... what does Buck have?
- Buck has us.

24:19.096 --> 24:21.319
Even though he may not
believe that right now.

24:24.101 --> 24:26.294
So what's Buck gonna do
for the rest of his life?

24:26.297 --> 24:27.969
I don't know. I'm not sure he even knows

24:27.971 --> 24:29.514
what he's gonna do with
the rest of his day.

24:29.516 --> 24:31.106
Although I suspect lying on the couch

24:31.108 --> 24:34.252
and bingeing cooking shows
will play a small part.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.321
As long as he's binging

24:35.324 --> 24:37.277
on the viewing and not the cooking.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.614
I saw this one cooking
show where the recipe

24:39.616 --> 24:41.983
called for five cans
of store-bought frosting

24:41.985 --> 24:43.785
to make eight cupcakes.

24:43.787 --> 24:45.911
Ew, I think I just got a
cavity listening to that.

24:47.191 --> 24:49.015
Honestly, I don't know how to help him.

24:49.018 --> 24:50.651
And he just seems so lost.

24:50.654 --> 24:51.892
I don't know if I should just give him

24:51.894 --> 24:53.560
a swift kick in the butt
and get him back out there

24:53.562 --> 24:57.131
or hug him and tell him
that it's all gonna be okay.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.958
Well, no rule says you can't do both.

24:58.961 --> 25:00.768
True.

25:05.441 --> 25:07.793
Uh, 911, what's your emergency?

25:07.796 --> 25:10.211
Help, please.

25:10.213 --> 25:12.579
She took me.

25:12.581 --> 25:14.815
I'm sorry, I'm having
trouble hearing you.

25:14.817 --> 25:17.417
- What's your location?
- Oh, no.

25:17.419 --> 25:19.586
She stabbed me.

25:19.588 --> 25:22.342
A woman stabbed you and took you.

25:22.345 --> 25:26.393
- Is that woman still there?
- No, bleeding.

25:26.395 --> 25:28.941
- Okay, what's your name?
- Jill.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.467
We have a female stabbing victim.

25:30.470 --> 25:31.831
She doesn't know the address and I can't

25:31.833 --> 25:33.333
pinpoint the location.

25:33.335 --> 25:35.636
Okay, Jill, you said you were bleeding.

25:35.638 --> 25:38.372
Is there anything you can use
to put pressure on the wound?

25:38.374 --> 25:41.174
- I don't want to die.
- That's right.

25:41.176 --> 25:43.843
You don't want to die.
So you're gonna fight.

25:43.845 --> 25:45.879
And I'm gonna help you. Now focus.

25:45.881 --> 25:48.081
Look around. Do you see a towel

25:48.083 --> 25:50.049
or anything that you can use?

25:50.051 --> 25:51.851
- Clothes.
- Grab whatever it is.

25:51.853 --> 25:53.495
Put it on that wound and press.

25:53.498 --> 25:55.272
Roll over on the wound if you have to.

25:55.275 --> 25:57.624
- Just put pressure on it.
- It hurts.

25:57.626 --> 26:00.092
I know it does.

26:00.094 --> 26:02.695
But you're gonna press,
and you're gonna fight,

26:02.697 --> 26:05.097
and you're gonna stay with me.

26:05.099 --> 26:08.901
We're gonna find you,
Jill. Do you hear me?

26:11.773 --> 26:14.143
Jill?

26:14.241 --> 26:16.108
Jill?

26:19.280 --> 26:21.480
Jill?

26:23.818 --> 26:25.818
The line's open, but still nothing.

26:25.821 --> 26:27.142
Phone company gave me contact info

26:27.144 --> 26:28.179
for the account holder.

26:28.182 --> 26:29.782
- It's her husband.
- Okay.

26:34.828 --> 26:36.620
- Hello?
- Mr. Evans, hi.

26:36.623 --> 26:38.963
This is, uh... Maddie Buckley.

26:38.966 --> 26:41.620
I am calling you from LA City Services

26:41.623 --> 26:42.581
and I was hoping that you could

26:42.583 --> 26:44.068
help me get in touch with your wife.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.632
- Do you know where she is?
- Uh, not sure.

26:46.635 --> 26:47.973
I think she was running
some errands today.

26:47.975 --> 26:49.273
Maybe shopping. Why?

26:49.275 --> 26:51.275
Do you have any idea where
she was going shopping?

26:51.277 --> 26:53.778
What's going on? Where
are you calling from?

26:53.780 --> 26:55.279
Uh, I work for the city.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.506
Your wife called us
earlier with a request

26:57.509 --> 26:59.510
and we're just trying to
get back in touch with her.

26:59.512 --> 27:02.077
- I can call her cell.
- I tried that.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.522
- She wasn't answering.
- That's not like her.

27:04.524 --> 27:05.912
I wish I could remember.

27:05.915 --> 27:08.159
She said something about
clothes for the baby.

27:08.161 --> 27:09.660
How old is your baby?

27:09.662 --> 27:12.763
Jill's due next week. It's our first.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.266
Jill's pregnant?

27:31.985 --> 27:35.319
License, registration, and
proof of insurance, ma'am.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.188
Was I speeding or something?

27:37.190 --> 27:39.482
Yep, and you blew through a stop sign.

27:52.337 --> 27:55.005
I'm gonna need you to step
out of the vehicle, ma'am.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.011
What is going on?

28:02.014 --> 28:04.447
All right, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to take a seat.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.886
- Who's blood is that?
- I don't...

28:09.888 --> 28:13.023
what blood?

28:13.025 --> 28:15.524
On your hands and your feet.

28:15.526 --> 28:18.360
Did you do something to your baby?

28:18.362 --> 28:20.662
She's fine.

28:20.664 --> 28:23.432
My baby is fine.

28:23.434 --> 28:27.945
727-0-30, I have a newborn
infant in respiratory distress.

28:27.948 --> 28:29.337
She's turning blue.

28:44.002 --> 28:45.703
Chimney, the NICU is prepped.

28:45.706 --> 28:47.768
They're waiting for you.

28:47.770 --> 28:49.469
Check the hospitals.

28:49.471 --> 28:51.304
See if anyone's missing a newborn.

28:51.306 --> 28:52.433
Williams!

28:54.309 --> 28:55.442
Talk to dispatch.

28:55.444 --> 28:57.144
Tell them to flag any strange calls

28:57.146 --> 29:01.181
involving a pregnant woman
or someone missing a baby.

29:01.183 --> 29:03.383
Hey, so how's the little one?

29:03.385 --> 29:04.813
She lost some blood,

29:04.816 --> 29:07.028
and the umbilical cord
wasn't tied off properly.

29:07.031 --> 29:09.069
Baby can't be more than an hour old.

29:09.072 --> 29:11.506
- Sergeant Grant?
- Yeah?

29:11.509 --> 29:14.043
So is she gonna be okay?

29:14.046 --> 29:16.847
This baby wasn't born in a hospital.

29:16.850 --> 29:18.465
Found this in the trunk.

29:21.670 --> 29:25.005
And that woman is not the mother.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.825
I'm sorry, how did you get my number?

29:28.828 --> 29:30.477
Your brother-in-law, Rick.

29:30.479 --> 29:32.221
He said you and Jill
were supposed to meet

29:32.224 --> 29:33.513
for breakfast this morning.

29:33.515 --> 29:35.382
Yeah, this place near my house.

29:35.384 --> 29:37.893
Jill's become obsessed with
their breakfast burritos.

29:37.896 --> 29:40.153
Though I'm not sure how
she can actually taste them

29:40.155 --> 29:41.631
with all the hot sauce she's been using.

29:41.633 --> 29:43.522
And what time did you leave her?

29:43.524 --> 29:46.158
A little bit after 9:00.
I had to get to work.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.926
And did she tell you
where she was going?

29:47.928 --> 29:51.388
She was going to get stuff for the baby.

29:51.391 --> 29:53.003
Uh, clothes, I think.

29:53.006 --> 29:54.866
Okay, where? A store?

29:54.868 --> 29:57.403
Did something happen to Jill?

29:57.405 --> 30:01.240
Your sister called 911 and
said she'd been attacked.

30:01.242 --> 30:02.641
But she didn't know where she was

30:02.643 --> 30:04.076
and we're trying to find
her, but I need your help.

30:04.078 --> 30:05.377
Oh, my God.

30:05.379 --> 30:06.845
She's been trying to save money,

30:06.847 --> 30:08.847
buying used baby
things she found online.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.287
She didn't want Rick to know.

30:10.290 --> 30:11.849
She knew he'd freak out.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.519
Well, she was going to meet someone

30:13.521 --> 30:15.269
who'd placed an ad online?

30:15.272 --> 30:17.362
- Where?
- It was a public place.

30:17.365 --> 30:20.258
It was supposed to be safe.

30:20.260 --> 30:22.093
Vitals, blood glucose are normal.

30:22.095 --> 30:23.595
No sign of impairment.

30:23.597 --> 30:24.851
Yeah, whatever's wrong with that lady,

30:24.853 --> 30:26.531
we don't have a test for it.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.099
Okay, well, dispatch said to stay here.

30:28.101 --> 30:30.535
- It's a critical missing.
- Or a possible homicide.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.537
Well, Chimney said the
baby started to respond

30:32.539 --> 30:33.938
when they got to the hospital.

30:33.940 --> 30:36.241
So maybe we'll get lucky twice today.

30:36.243 --> 30:37.442
All right.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.348
Tell me where the mother is, Nancy.

30:43.350 --> 30:46.551
- What'd you do to her?
- I'm the mother.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.956
Is Aria okay? When can I see her?

30:51.958 --> 30:54.558
We both know that you're
not that child's mother.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.728
- She's not your baby.
- No! No, you don't understand.

30:57.730 --> 31:01.064
She has to be. I-I promised.

31:01.066 --> 31:03.667
- Promised what?
- I promised George

31:03.669 --> 31:05.702
there was gonna be a baby.

31:05.704 --> 31:08.119
There has to be a baby this time.

31:08.122 --> 31:10.143
I don't know if you're insane or evil,

31:10.146 --> 31:13.079
but neither one is helping
your situation right now.

31:13.082 --> 31:16.845
Because if we do not find
her in time, if she dies,

31:16.848 --> 31:19.249
things will not go well for you.

31:19.251 --> 31:23.086
Now you tell me what you
did with that baby's mother.

31:23.088 --> 31:24.621
I'm the mother.

31:24.623 --> 31:25.982
Sergeant, we got something.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.590
Her sister said Jill was meeting

31:27.592 --> 31:29.659
a woman in Griffith
Park by the pony rides.

31:29.661 --> 31:31.828
All right, I'm two minutes out.

31:31.830 --> 31:33.751
Okay, we checked the call logs.

31:33.754 --> 31:36.166
Nothing from the park
today. No reports of people

31:36.168 --> 31:38.201
seeing an assault or a woman in trouble.

31:38.203 --> 31:39.836
The park's more than 4,000 acres.

31:39.838 --> 31:41.370
She could've taken Jill anywhere.

31:41.372 --> 31:43.606
Did Jill tell you anything
about her location?

31:43.608 --> 31:45.608
She sounded really disoriented.

31:45.610 --> 31:47.811
All she said was it was dark.

31:47.813 --> 31:50.646
There was a weird sound, though.

31:50.648 --> 31:52.768
I heard it after she passed out.

31:52.771 --> 31:55.484
Like a whistle, or maybe a horn.

32:14.705 --> 32:16.671
I'm sorry, I haven't seen her.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.106
I checked all the bathrooms.

32:18.108 --> 32:19.674
She's not there.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.310
Are you sure you didn't see her?

32:21.312 --> 32:22.945
It would have been about an hour ago.

32:22.947 --> 32:25.814
She'd be driving a
1996 burgundy Cadillac.

32:25.816 --> 32:28.051
- Wait, the red Caddy?
- So you do remember?

32:28.054 --> 32:29.651
No, I remember the car.

32:29.653 --> 32:31.720
We cater to mostly the
SUV and minivan crowd.

32:31.722 --> 32:33.881
But that woman wasn't driving it.

32:33.884 --> 32:36.418
It was some other lady. Different hair.

32:36.421 --> 32:38.659
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

32:41.831 --> 32:44.031
So Nancy moved the car, but why?

32:44.033 --> 32:45.905
- Throw us off?
- Nancy meets Jill here,

32:45.908 --> 32:47.668
shows her the baby clothes.

32:47.670 --> 32:49.837
They're out in the open,
people can see them.

32:49.839 --> 32:51.053
So she can't take the baby here.

32:51.055 --> 32:52.221
She's got to get Jill alone.

32:52.224 --> 32:53.841
Nancy walks Jill to her car,

32:53.843 --> 32:55.743
offers to put the clothes in her trunk.

32:55.752 --> 32:57.403
Hits her in the head,
throws her in the trunk

32:57.405 --> 32:58.479
and moves the car.

32:58.481 --> 32:59.961
Jill did tell Maddie it was dark.

32:59.964 --> 33:01.230
She's still in that trunk.

33:01.233 --> 33:03.017
Nancy couldn't have driven far.

33:03.019 --> 33:04.723
She needed to take that baby

33:04.726 --> 33:07.358
and carry it back to her own car.

33:12.694 --> 33:15.128
Can you get a car back there?

33:15.130 --> 33:17.563
Yeah, that's where we
load the horse trailers in.

33:17.565 --> 33:20.166
Bobby, there!

33:24.706 --> 33:26.706
I tried the door. It's locked.

33:30.545 --> 33:32.578
All right.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.444
I got a pulse. It's
weak, but it's there.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.283
All right, let's get her out of there.

33:41.523 --> 33:43.777
Jill, Jill, are you there?

33:43.780 --> 33:47.027
Jill, are you with me?
Jill, can you hear me?

33:47.030 --> 33:48.074
Jill, please respond.

33:48.077 --> 33:50.897
- Maddie.
- Athena, is she...

33:50.899 --> 33:52.696
Alive.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.567
She's alive.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.430
I can't thank you enough.

34:07.432 --> 34:11.033
If it hadn't been for all of you...

34:12.937 --> 34:15.871
Your wife doing okay?

34:15.873 --> 34:17.706
Yeah, she made it through surgery

34:17.708 --> 34:19.277
and the doctors say she's doing well,

34:19.281 --> 34:20.610
all things considered.

34:20.612 --> 34:22.449
Jill's a fighter. They both are.

34:22.452 --> 34:24.079
You guys come up with a name yet?

34:24.081 --> 34:26.516
You know, we had a list before.

34:26.518 --> 34:29.002
Somehow, none of those
seem right anymore.

34:29.005 --> 34:31.353
You'll figure it out. You have time.

34:31.355 --> 34:33.121
Yeah.

34:37.893 --> 34:39.893
You ready to go meet
your mom, little girl?

34:49.373 --> 34:52.768
Oh, she is so tiny and sweet.

34:52.772 --> 34:54.309
Are you and Chimney thinking about...

34:54.311 --> 34:55.342
Well, you two just got married.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.512
- Are you?
- Point taken.

35:00.116 --> 35:03.117
Well, people always say,
"they grow up so fast."

35:03.119 --> 35:04.785
And they do, sort of.

35:04.787 --> 35:07.621
But I'm not interested
in resetting the clock

35:07.623 --> 35:09.048
for another 18 years.

35:09.051 --> 35:10.424
18?

35:10.426 --> 35:12.759
Buck is 28 and I still
have my hands full.

35:12.761 --> 35:14.761
What now?

35:16.632 --> 35:18.265
See?

35:18.267 --> 35:20.934
They don't grow up that fast.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.782
It's weird, right?
Everyone's got baby fever.

35:35.784 --> 35:39.152
Oh, my God, we are surrounded
by people with kids,

35:39.154 --> 35:41.254
people trying to have kids,

35:41.256 --> 35:43.656
people eviscerating
other people to get a kid.

35:46.764 --> 35:48.795
You know, we never
really talked about that.

35:48.797 --> 35:50.463
Is that something that you want?

35:50.465 --> 35:55.468
- To eviscerate someone?
- To have kids.

35:55.470 --> 35:57.470
I did.

35:57.472 --> 36:00.807
But then, I got married,
and it just never felt...

36:00.809 --> 36:02.741
safe in that situation.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.399
What about you?

36:04.402 --> 36:08.480
Still adjusting to the idea
that I'm not a kid myself.

36:08.483 --> 36:11.317
No, seriously, uh...

36:11.319 --> 36:13.819
I had a great mom that I lost too soon,

36:13.821 --> 36:16.288
a nonexistent father I barely speak to.

36:16.290 --> 36:18.958
I just don't know if I'd know
how to be a good parent myself.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.442
Yeah, me, either.

36:21.445 --> 36:24.663
I still feel like I'm carrying
around too much baggage.

36:24.665 --> 36:26.832
Okay.

36:26.834 --> 36:29.835
- So then, we don't know.
- Yeah.

36:29.837 --> 36:33.505
We are a firm maybe, someday.

36:33.507 --> 36:36.842
- Someday.
- Wait.

36:36.844 --> 36:39.396
Are we the only people we
know who don't have kids?

36:41.749 --> 36:43.448
Buck.

36:49.156 --> 36:50.855
Get up.

36:52.859 --> 36:55.860
Why, man? Come on.

36:57.698 --> 37:00.150
Because it's morning and
you have things to do.

37:00.153 --> 37:02.434
No, I really don't.

37:02.436 --> 37:04.235
You need to get out of this house

37:04.237 --> 37:06.104
and take a walk around the block

37:06.106 --> 37:08.840
and get some fresh air.

37:08.842 --> 37:11.910
Why? What's the point?

37:11.912 --> 37:14.560
Well, the point is, your life

37:14.563 --> 37:16.881
isn't over just because
you're not a firefighter.

37:16.883 --> 37:18.910
Says the firefighter.

37:18.913 --> 37:21.329
You know, that blood clot
could've almost killed you.

37:21.332 --> 37:23.754
But it didn't.

37:23.756 --> 37:25.890
You have your whole life ahead of you,

37:25.892 --> 37:29.294
so why don't you just take it as a win

37:29.296 --> 37:31.300
and stop feeling sorry for yourself?

37:39.572 --> 37:42.273
Hey, Buck.

37:42.275 --> 37:44.508
Hey, buddy.

37:44.510 --> 37:47.346
Uh, what are you doing here?

37:47.349 --> 37:51.115
He's hanging out with his Buck today!

37:51.117 --> 37:54.277
Because I have to go work today.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.401
Where's Carla?

37:56.404 --> 37:58.638
She went to Morongo.

37:58.641 --> 37:59.723
Mm-hmm.

38:01.126 --> 38:03.927
So take him out, have some fun.

38:03.929 --> 38:06.429
Maybe you'll learn something.

38:06.431 --> 38:09.933
He never feels sorry for himself.

38:09.935 --> 38:13.003
- Love you, buddy.
- Love you.

38:13.005 --> 38:14.637
Love you, Dad.

38:23.182 --> 38:25.949
So what do you like to do for fun?

38:35.960 --> 38:38.427
Now which one do you want to go on next?

38:38.429 --> 38:40.429
Down here? Come on, come on.

38:50.308 --> 38:52.975
Great, right?

38:55.079 --> 38:56.946
What?

39:08.459 --> 39:09.991
- Mmm!
- Good?

39:09.993 --> 39:12.360
Yeah.

39:23.874 --> 39:26.007
This is for all the marbles.

39:26.009 --> 39:28.376
- Buck?
- Yeah, buddy?

39:28.378 --> 39:30.312
I don't want the marble.

39:30.314 --> 39:32.013
I want the bear!

39:33.584 --> 39:35.551
No, it's... it's just
a figure of speech.

39:35.553 --> 39:37.718
- Now, you ready?
- Yeah!

39:37.720 --> 39:39.170
All right. I'm gonna hold here.

39:40.357 --> 39:42.890
All right, all right, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

39:45.490 --> 39:49.530
Oh, you did it! Give me my high five!

39:49.532 --> 39:53.801
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

39:53.803 --> 39:57.160
And we have a winner!

40:03.347 --> 40:07.382
Buck!

40:09.953 --> 40:12.086
Buck!

40:12.088 --> 40:14.915
Oh, here, uh, sorry, I... I got it.

40:17.762 --> 40:21.594
Are you okay?

40:21.597 --> 40:24.465
The universe is mocking me.

40:24.467 --> 40:27.767
Let's go feed the fish.

40:37.279 --> 40:40.947
You ever think about what
you want to do with your life?

40:40.949 --> 40:43.317
What you want to be when you grow up?

40:43.319 --> 40:47.120
Astronaut or a pirate.

40:47.122 --> 40:49.122
Some good choices.

40:49.124 --> 40:51.424
Cool outfits too.

40:51.426 --> 40:53.192
No, wait.

40:53.194 --> 40:55.128
A firefighter!

40:57.699 --> 40:59.766
Yeah, me too.

41:05.306 --> 41:07.441
But, Chris, if those career paths

41:07.444 --> 41:09.625
don't work out, um...

41:11.713 --> 41:15.081
I hope you do find something you love.

41:15.083 --> 41:17.951
You know, something you're good at.

41:17.953 --> 41:21.687
That makes you feel like you matter.

41:21.689 --> 41:25.324
Something you could do forever.

41:25.326 --> 41:29.162
Because when you do,

41:29.164 --> 41:32.165
it's gonna tell you who you are.

41:32.167 --> 41:36.669
And it's gonna show you
the rest of your life.

41:36.671 --> 41:39.172
And that is the best feeling.

41:43.978 --> 41:47.413
And I hope you get that.

41:47.415 --> 41:50.183
And I hope you get to keep it.

41:50.185 --> 41:52.775
You're gonna be okay, kid.

42:30.155 --> 42:35.708
