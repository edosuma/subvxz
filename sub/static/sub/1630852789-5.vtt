00:02.000 --> 00:06.440
Clive Cornell and Joseph William
Bailey, the jury have found you
guilty on all accounts.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.560
I hereby sentence you both to life
imprisonment.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.400
Society deserves a rest from your
"activities."

00:16.320 --> 00:19.840
Clive and Joey got 25 years each.
And Sidney got off.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.920
But he had a punishment of his own.

00:21.960 --> 00:26.280
In the East End of London, being a
known grass was pretty much a death
sentence.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.360
Thanks to the tireless work of my
team and the Metropolitan Police,

00:30.400 --> 00:33.640
we now have the masterminds of the
Newham robbery behind bars.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.360
We felt like a weight had been
lifted off our shoulders.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.280
But we still weren't completely
safe.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.640
The good news was Billy had come up
trumps

00:41.680 --> 00:43.840
and the baptist was
transferring money.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.000
Nicely washed and cleaned from
Switzerland.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.040
We could finally have a spend-up.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.120
Me and Albert decided to keep it
small and subtle for now.

00:53.160 --> 00:57.720
Elsewhere, Mick and Phil had bought
themselves a glitzy nightclub up in
Soho.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.040
I mean, Mick had let it all go to
his thick head...literally.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.200
After the fallout of the Savoy, we
hadn't spoken to them both in
months.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.400
Silly, really.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.560
Looking back, it was the time we
needed each other the most.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.040
They've called the nightclub Gold
Rush.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.920
I mean, seriously, might as well
put a sign up saying, "We did the
robbery."

01:36.960 --> 01:39.560
You're quite right. I'll speak to
them both.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.080
We should continue to maintain a low
profile and

01:42.120 --> 01:44.400
I'll put a halt to smelting gold for
now.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.400
I mean, we're keeping an all right
stance struggling in this cafe

01:47.440 --> 01:50.080
while they're out there risking it
all being flash in Soho.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.280
Thanks for coming, Billy, mate.

01:56.440 --> 02:00.120
Let me sit back now, just tell
them what you told me.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.200
OK, I am being threatened.

02:03.080 --> 02:09.200
They've targeted my flat and I've
received today...a very...

02:10.680 --> 02:12.920
..traumatic death threat. Someone
shat in his letterbox.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.880
Faeces. It's hard to tell whether
it's a human or a child.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.560
A child? It would've been an adult
that put it through.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.440
It's just not on. It's not on.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.320
What I want, what I need is a new
place to stay.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.240
I'm not going back to the farm.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.600
I want a house. I want a safe house.

02:32.640 --> 02:37.080
A safe house with... What you need
is a new identity.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.360
I know a man, Ronnie Gatlin.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.680
He's an expert in false
documentation,

02:41.720 --> 02:43.880
new identities and relocation.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.640
He makes people disappear.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.600
That's who to speak to. How
do we speak to him?

02:49.640 --> 02:51.800
I can arrange a meeting but not with
you.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.840
Natasha and Albert will have to
facilitate.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.320
You won't be able to tell him
Sidney's a rat.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.520
We're not exactly shouting it from
the rooftops.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.680
He hates rats.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.680
You'll be moved out to Spain. Spain?

03:04.720 --> 03:08.760
You'll be safer out there. Nobody
knows you and there are no
extradition rights.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.200
No what? Extra... If you're in
Spain, the police can't touch you.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.120
That's why everyone moves out there.
That's what that means. Oh, OK.

03:15.160 --> 03:19.600
He'll set you up with a new
identity, a new job, legitimate
business investments.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.240
Like a little bar on the beach.
You'd love that.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.160
Maybe we should talk to him about
getting us out there.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.840
Bit different for us. We've got a
life, Sidney hasn't.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.560
I know. I'd like a reggae bar
ideally.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.160
Are you... OK, and he's off.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.880
You don't even like reggae.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.600
I've always wanted a reggae bar,
Natalie.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.000
It's in at the moment.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.960
I could wear my vest, my string
vest.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.920
No-one wants to see you in that,
Sidney.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.960
THEY GREET EACH OTHER

04:05.480 --> 04:07.280
Through you come, look at you.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.920
You look stunning. I like a little
curtsey, it's like meeting the
Queen.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.680
Hello, Candice. How are you doing?
You all right?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.840
Can't come in. Not dressed like
that.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.640
I'm sorry. Strict dress code, I'm
afraid.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.960
I was just passing by. I thought I'd
come see this for myself.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.280
The Gold Rush.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.120
That's the place. Gold Rush. We've
had all manner of people.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.080
Phil Collins came in last Tuesday.
The guy from Bergerac.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.240
Come on, boys. Come on through.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.680
How'd you get the cash for this
place then?

04:35.840 --> 04:38.120
Well, that's a fantastic question
there.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.600
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting
in my gaff,

04:40.640 --> 04:42.560
I got a little rat-a-tat-tat on the
door.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.280
I answered, there's a fella standing
there.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.400
He said he's there to inform me that
our shared mother, what I didn't
know we had,

04:48.440 --> 04:51.520
had passed away. In her will, she's
left me a painting.

04:52.560 --> 04:56.080
It turns out it's a Rembrandt so
there we go, there you have it.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.760
So you got this magic nightclub?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.960
I took it down Claridge's, honestly.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.400
I took it there Thursday, Friday I'm
told it's worth Â£1,000,000.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.600
Saturday, I buy this gaff. There we
go, darling.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.080
Claridge's is a hotel. Is it really?

05:08.120 --> 05:11.000
I, yes... Mick. Yep?

05:11.040 --> 05:14.400
You remember Tasha's little mate,
don't you? You all right?

05:15.440 --> 05:19.040
You know she can't come in... She's
not coming in. I've told you,
haven't I?

05:19.080 --> 05:23.160
She can't come in dressed like that.
Lovely to see you, we're going to
have a line.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.720
There you go, mate. Just to get us
in the mood.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.160
Ooh!

05:35.920 --> 05:38.200
That's nice buff.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.360
Tell you what, mate. Yes, mate?

05:41.400 --> 05:44.440
I love you, mate. I fucking love
you. I love you more.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.200
I love you. Cos you get me.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.640
You are gonna love this. Oh, yes.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.440
Here we go.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.520
If you told me a couple weeks ago,
we'd be doing this together... What
you doing?

06:00.840 --> 06:04.800
No. I thought we was gonna get
naked, have a little tumble around.
No.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.840
K15 kevlar.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.320
Fully shock-plated.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.960
This, my friend, makes you feel
invincible.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.120
Nice, innit?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.560
KNOCKING
Gentlemen.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.720
Don't walk in like that. We weren't
doing nothing. We were talking.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.760
I need to grab another cassette
tape. Did Albert not call ahead?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.440
We haven't heard from him in ages.
Nothing.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.040
That's between you and Albert.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.040
The plan is to smelt double the
amount this week. What?

06:30.080 --> 06:33.440
Is that all right with him? With
Sid, with Tash, run it past them?

06:33.480 --> 06:34.760
It's all agreed, yeah.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.000
Cos we've got investments we want to
plough through. Tell him about them.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.920
I want to flag up you chaps are
spending fast and wild.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.920
Who said that? Yeah, who said that?

06:43.960 --> 06:46.360
Word from the wise, I'd advise a
little restraint.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.760
Tell him about the plan.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.680
Do you know where we can get a
yacht? Big boat, Phil.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.960
Big one. We can have parties on it
and that. Music industry.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.640
We could sleep under it, we only
want us on it.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.560
Just the two of us, bedroom each.
Big one with a bath.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.000
Want a puff? I'll leave you chaps to
it.

07:02.040 --> 07:06.680
You gotta go? You gotta go? Yes.
Come here. Oh.

07:08.640 --> 07:12.560
Bill's off. Phil, mate, Bill's
going. You off? You gotta go?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.320
Is everything all right? Did we say
something? No.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.400
Have a wonderful evening. You too.
You off, yeah? Nice one, Bill.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.400
Have a nice evening. See you later.
You good, yeah?

07:23.480 --> 07:25.680
I like him. He comes in...

07:26.440 --> 07:29.880
..he says things and then he goes.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.360
It's them. It's the Fantoni's.
Really?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.760
You're still sniffing around the
wrong dog's arse there, girl.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.480
I have pictures. Of them in a park
having a fucking picnic?

07:59.720 --> 08:00.960
Well, well...

08:02.080 --> 08:04.280
..you know who this is? Billy
English.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.680
Known money launderer and Hatton
Garden jeweller.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
And a proper face.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.640
This is a very good lead.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.400
You've done good work here, Yasmin.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.200
I'll stay on it.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.480
Malcolm.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.480
I'll keep you posted. Yeah. Yeah.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.560
Hello.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.840
Is that for free? OK.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.000
Cheers. Is that my man?

08:40.040 --> 08:44.880
Albie Fantoni. That's me. Ronnie
Gatlin, what an honour.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.760
Welcome aboard, son. Let the dog see
the rabbit.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.240
Look at you. Oh.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.720
Lovely seeing you. Thanks for
shaving for us.

08:57.720 --> 09:02.320
Who's this young lady? I'm Natasha.
Enchante, Natasha.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.760
You've struck gold as well then, eh?
He's punching. Yeah. Believe me.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.760
Meet my beautiful Sofia. Sofia.

09:11.880 --> 09:12.920
Sofia!

09:15.640 --> 09:17.080
Sorry, baby.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.800
Albie. Natasha. This is Sofia.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.600
You're beautiful, like a goddess.
Thank you.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.960
I might not give her back. You
better. No.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.480
Now get yourself one of my rum
punches.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.920
Drink two of them, be found in a
fucking ditch.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.000
Well, I hope not.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.480
Welcome to my poop deck.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.640
Come here, tell me what was it like.
Were you expecting so much gold in
there?

09:44.280 --> 09:46.280
CASSETTE PLAYS

09:53.600 --> 09:56.760
# On her way to work one morning

09:56.800 --> 09:59.400
# Down the path alongside the lake

10:00.560 --> 10:06.480
# A tender-hearted woman saw a poor
half-frozen snake

10:06.520 --> 10:12.320
# His pretty coloured skin had been
all frosted with the dew

10:13.360 --> 10:19.160
# "Oh well, " she cried, "I'll take
you in and I'll take care of you"

10:19.200 --> 10:23.080
# Take me in, oh, tender woman,
yes, come on in

10:23.120 --> 10:26.040
# Take me in for heaven's sake,
yes, come on in

10:26.080 --> 10:32.640
# Take me in, tender woman, sighed
the snake. #

10:35.920 --> 10:38.560
So, Billy tells me you've got a
fella who needs out.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.440
Yeah, it's S...Andrew is his name.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.440
Andrew. Is he involved in the
robbery?

10:44.440 --> 10:47.000
Er, the robbery, no. No.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.480
Is he the fucking milkman then? He
wasn't the milkman, no.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.680
What I meant by that was that he was
one of my heavies.

10:55.680 --> 11:01.240
Nice. He's the geezer that, er, the
pistol hit the guard. He's cool.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.400
The security guard. The rat.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.880
That grassed up Clive and Joy? Yeah,
that bastard.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.480
What's you do if you got your hands
on him?

11:13.040 --> 11:16.120
Erm, you don't want to know the
stuff I'd do to him.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.600
I want to know. Tell me.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.240
OK. Well, I'd, er...

11:22.120 --> 11:25.000
..I'd go into his room late at night
whilst he's asleep... Yeah.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.200
And you'll fucking grab him by the
throat, hang him up, right.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.440
Grab a fucking Stanley knife and
just cut the fucking bollocks off
him.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.200
Slice him in half. Flip him over.
One thumb up the hole

11:35.240 --> 11:38.160
and fucking ride him to happy town,
while whispering in his ear,

11:38.200 --> 11:40.360
"Your fucking ma's next," something
like that?

11:40.400 --> 11:44.040
Er, I was gonna say pillow over the
face but that works.

11:44.080 --> 11:48.400
All really good killing thoughts and
strong ideas that we can throw into
the mix.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.160
So, yeah, that's... And then what?
..really strong ideas.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.960
Oh, I've got a meat, like a sausage
grinder at work.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.920
Oh! I could cut him up and put him
in there and in the fryer.

11:58.960 --> 12:03.280
And then put him in a sausage
sandwich with brown sauce, turkey.
Bastard.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.000
Who's a dirty bastard? Er, no, just
boys talk.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.760
This fella's giving me a hard-on. He
told me about chopping somebody up

12:09.800 --> 12:11.720
and putting them in the fucking
sausage machine.

12:11.760 --> 12:15.960
Oh, no, we were just brainstorming.
Obviously not a good idea for the
hygiene certificate.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.480
I wouldn't do that, but you know,
yeah. I was just...OK.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.320
You still talking? See you later.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.320
There's a little restaurant out
there down by the coast.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.880
Think about it. You have a few too
many sangrias,

12:28.920 --> 12:31.600
you're hungover wandering on the
seafront, and then you see it.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.640
A sign, "Alberto's Famous
Gutbusters."

12:35.680 --> 12:38.200
Or whatever the Spanish translation
is.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.400
Do they even have caffs out there?
Of course they do. they pronounce it
different.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.640
Yeah? Cafe.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.120
When you say it like that, I quite
like that.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.320
Looks like a professional hit. Yeah.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.840
Or someone that he trusted
when he wasn't expecting it.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.240
Is this what you found on him,
George?

13:55.640 --> 13:57.360
Motown's greatest hits.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.800
It's not the worst to be ironed out
on, is it? Everyone loves a bit of
Tamla.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.920
What you thinking, Fred?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.880
You seriously think that the
Fantoni's had something to do with
this?

14:11.920 --> 14:15.280
As far as we know, he was last seen
with Natasha, Albert and Sidney.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.800
What's that? A coincidence?

14:21.200 --> 14:22.240
Cheers.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.040
Up the surveillance.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.800
The news of Billy's murder knocked
us for six.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.920
He was the once person we trusted.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.480
The one person making this whole
thing tick.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.160
What do we do without him?

14:50.200 --> 14:53.200
And, more importantly, were we next?

14:53.240 --> 14:55.920
The panic had well and truly set in.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.480
I don't like this. I don't like any
of it.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.400
Get some more buff. Give me some
more. Let's have more.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.440
Yeah, take the edge off. Yeah,
that's it.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.240
Oh, sweet. Fucking hell. Mary Jane.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.200
Oh, my. Big one now. Big bung now.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.480
Give us...do us a cup of tea each.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.720
Yeah? Milky tea, milky tea. There's
no milk. What?

15:15.840 --> 15:17.240
It's mainly... Shhh.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.800
Who is it? Shhh.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.080
CAR DOOR SLAMS

15:25.120 --> 15:27.960
We have company, Phil. What? Make
the kettle.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.360
Cover me.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.800
Who is it, Mick? Three of them.
Three of them? Shadows, shadows.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.000
Get the cricket bat, mate. Get the
cricket bat.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.480
Fucking guard off.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.080
It's Albert. It is Albert. Yeah?
Tash and Sidney.

15:57.120 --> 16:01.360
Was you followed? It's hard to tell,
it was rush hour and loads of
traffic.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.480
The state of you two. The state of
you, more like. What?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.600
What's happened to Billy, what do
you know?

16:07.640 --> 16:09.560
What do you mean? What do you know?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.480
Put the cricket bat down before I
wrap it round your head.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.400
We've just been here, the two of us,
hiding it out,

16:16.440 --> 16:18.360
doing boof, drinking cups of tea.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.520
Maybe we should be hiding out, go to
Spain, Ronnie can sort it.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.800
Who's Ronnie? Who's Ronnie? Ronnie
is a really cool geezer

16:24.840 --> 16:27.720
that I happen to get along with and
he can sort anything.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.720
He's getting me out to Spain. Yeah.

16:29.760 --> 16:33.120
I'm leaving the country. From now
on, I'll be known only as Andrew.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.040
Or Andreas to the locals.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.160
This is all getting a bit
suspicious. So Billy dies,

16:38.200 --> 16:40.760
and now these lot are going to
Spain. Interesting.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.640
Oh, is it a bit suspicious, is it?
Interesting.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.520
He's going to Spain because he
grassed on two of the most powerful
gangsters in London.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.440
That makes sense. It does make
sense. All right, fair enough.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.680
Did you check whether they've
actually got reggae out in Spain?

16:53.720 --> 16:56.840
I meant to ask. Sidney, it doesn't
really matter now. It does matter.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.000
Or the reggae bar's gonna fall flat.
Mick, listen to me.

17:00.040 --> 17:04.400
We need to go and find those tapes,
we need to get them back and keep
them safe.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.720
And all of us need to go about life
as normal.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.680
Stop drawing attention to ourselves.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.040
Hold on, what's that mean?

17:11.080 --> 17:13.960
You opened a club and called it The
Gold Rush, you mug.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.360
Don't get all salty because you're
stuck in your smelly little cafe.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.560
That's not very nice. It's not a
smelly caff.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.440
And we're doing a little thing
called laying low.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.600
And maybe you should've tried that
yourself.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.040
I've tried everything. Have you
tried not being an idiot?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.960
Stop it! Please, come on.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.920
Squabbling like kids, idiots, fools.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.560
Disgusting. We are friends.

17:36.920 --> 17:43.000
You're all my family. I mean we're
not family constructed by semen or
seed but we are in a way...

17:43.280 --> 17:44.280
..you know.

17:45.360 --> 17:50.360
The point is this. At times of need,
we need to turn to each other.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.680
Right? Lean on one another.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.320
I've missed all of you.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.760
Tash. Sidney, Andrew.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.040
When's the last time you went to
sleep?

18:07.080 --> 18:09.760
Three, maybe four days ago.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.200
That's the thing with this stuff.
Can keep going on it. I'll get it.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.520
Sid, do you want some? Is it
cocaine? Yeah.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.560
What's that on your head? Toupee.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.480
Get away from the car. Get away from
the car.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.240
Not the car. Not the car!

18:55.280 --> 18:57.480
What's the car done to you!

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
No!

19:17.160 --> 19:21.120
Here they are. Particularly
unsavoury business with the car.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.720
Mick Neville.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.840
I don't have to be as forward as to
introduce myself.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.120
With the accent and the company
that you're keeping.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.680
I'm guessing you're Ma McTavish.
Heard a lot about you.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.560
Likewise. Have a seat.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.840
I'm a fan of them all myself.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.280
It's like sitting on a marshmallow
on a cloud.

19:52.320 --> 19:56.160
I don't know what they're made of.
I'll check the label. Our man was a
gambler.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.280
All right. We saw you fight one
night in the Royal Albert Hall.

20:01.320 --> 20:05.200
Did you? He put a bet on you on
account of your size.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.720
12 rounds later and you're still
standing.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.600
You hadn't thrown a bastard punch
either. He was a slippery customer.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.800
He kept moving about. It's hard with
a moving target.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.520
My man lost a lot of money that
night and he never forgot about you.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.680
I don't know if you know my man.
Your man? Never met him.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.120
But he has a unique way of doing
things sometimes.

20:31.160 --> 20:35.840
He'd jib a man's lungs and his
kidneys

20:35.880 --> 20:39.120
and he would throw them in the sea
so that they'd sink.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.600
Sometimes they'd walk back up to the
top.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.120
Do you know what he'd call them? No?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.520
Mick Nevilles.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.160
Because they wouldn't go down.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.840
Oh. What a sweet sentiment.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.080
Both humbling and terrifying in the
same measure.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.680
Tell your husband from me thank you.
He's dead. I killed him.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.840
OK. Right, right.

21:14.160 --> 21:18.160
You know what? I have a little
trouble keeping track of why you're
here.

21:18.200 --> 21:21.280
Well, we have a wee problem with the
current setup.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.680
We're doing what Billy said, to the
letter of the law, we're following
orders.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.400
Mr English had ideas of his own.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.040
For the past month, the kipper
hasn't been smelt in the boot.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.120
Nabbing the gold for his own ends.
That's out of order.

21:34.160 --> 21:38.080
I'll pull Bill in here, I'll say,
"Bill, mate. That's out of order."

21:38.120 --> 21:40.280
Mr English has been terminated.

21:41.640 --> 21:45.400
What, you sacked him? Gave him the
old heave-ho? We put an end to him.

21:45.440 --> 21:49.800
Is he dead? How would you know this?
How'd you know such a thing?

21:49.840 --> 21:52.720
Cos my boy Percy shot him in the
back of the head.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.800
Now, you cross us...

21:56.880 --> 21:58.440
..and that's the McTavish way.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Whit's fir ye will no go past ye.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.920
All right. Now, we laid down the
investment for that Newham job.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.880
So we make the rules.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.040
We want half the gold in one drop.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.520
You have five days. Give us a week.

22:16.560 --> 22:20.120
I do a lot more in a week. Time for
negotiation is over.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.720
It's the fucking gold or the fucking
lead.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.800
By lead, do you mean bullets? Aye.
We'll take the gold, I'll do gold,
yeah.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.480
That took a lot longer than it
should have.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.000
Fuck sake.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.240
The vultures were starting to circle
overhead.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.400
Some we knew about, some we didn't.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.960
But we could feel the net was
closing in.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.200
We knew we needed to do something.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.640
We knew we needed to scarper.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.280
Gold location number 22.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.320
