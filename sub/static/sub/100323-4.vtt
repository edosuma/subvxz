00:49.571 --> 00:52.052
Aah!

00:59.233 --> 01:01.365
Hmm.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.934
Drop your weapon.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.812
Mmm!

01:16.902 --> 01:19.557
Oh! And that's when I wake up.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.560
It's been the same dream for the past week.
What do you think?

01:22.604 --> 01:24.823
I've heard it before.You have?

01:24.867 --> 01:28.218
It's a very common anxiety
dream among law enforcement.

01:28.262 --> 01:32.570
Sometimes secret service agents have
one about not taking the bullet.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.659
What do you think it means?

01:34.703 --> 01:37.009
The axe murderer
comes across having

01:37.053 --> 01:39.316
schizoaffective disorder,
which is odd because of...

01:39.360 --> 01:41.840
Spencer, that's a profile.

01:41.884 --> 01:45.322
What does the dream
make you feel?

01:49.848 --> 01:52.286
You know,
when we started a few weeks ago,

01:52.329 --> 01:54.940
you said you wanted to
dive into the deep end,

01:54.984 --> 01:57.247
trying to resolve feelings
toward a co-worker.

01:57.291 --> 02:00.120
Jj and I have worked through it.
We're actually... we're doing great,

02:00.163 --> 02:02.948
especially after what she's been through.
It's kind of amazing...

02:02.992 --> 02:05.951
But we... we're not
talking about her,

02:05.995 --> 02:08.258
we're talking about you.

02:09.781 --> 02:12.219
You've been at the bau
for 14 years?

02:12.262 --> 02:14.003
15. At a job that

02:14.046 --> 02:16.005
dominates your time and focus.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.268
Must take a lot out of you.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.270
Sometimes, but I
love it, though.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.143
But we all need healthy outlets,

02:23.186 --> 02:24.970
so, what are yours?

02:25.014 --> 02:28.365
Uh, well, I read, I, um...

02:28.409 --> 02:30.367
Who do you talk to?

02:30.411 --> 02:32.717
I, um... well, jj,

02:32.761 --> 02:35.111
rossi, Luke.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.331
Who do you talk to
outside of work?

02:40.377 --> 02:41.857
Nobody.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.338
All right, time's almost up.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.905
Take today.
Don't think about work.

02:46.949 --> 02:49.995
Don't think about work?
What do you mean?

02:50.039 --> 02:51.519
Not even a little bit.

02:51.562 --> 02:54.652
I want you to have
one normal conversation

02:54.696 --> 02:58.178
with one normal person,
then come back and tell me about it.

02:58.221 --> 03:01.050
Or I could come up
with a plan about what I

03:01.093 --> 03:03.071
was going to say, you know,
before actually executing it...

03:03.095 --> 03:04.662
Just do it.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.708
Ok.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.364
Thanks.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.246
Hi.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.248
Hi.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.772
Phone.

03:27.816 --> 03:30.253
Hi. Sorry. Yeah.
I'm here.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.821
Just some guy in the elevator.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.786
Oh.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.397
Oh, my.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.181
The holes don't line up.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.705
And the color really...

03:47.749 --> 03:50.230
Announces itself.
And don't start.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.842
I accidentally ordered...
Red online.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.845
It's custom-made.
There's absolutely no returns,

03:56.888 --> 03:58.542
so I'm pretending to love it.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.153
Can't you paint it anything else?
I tried that.

04:01.197 --> 04:04.026
It's made out of some kind
of, like, some kind

04:04.069 --> 04:06.855
of space-age polymer and
the paint won't even stick.

04:06.898 --> 04:09.379
Oh, man.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.903
This used to be my office,

04:11.947 --> 04:13.992
and now I'm working
at the kitchen table.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.274
We're holding this together
with scotch tape and bubble gum.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.259
Looks like we've got our work
cut out for us. Where's prentiss?

04:19.302 --> 04:22.262
Oh, I'm here. Ooh.
But not to work.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.829
I put myself
on refreshment duty.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.834
Oh, what?
It's my Saturday, too.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.315
And doughnuts are
an anytime food

04:32.359 --> 04:35.840
if you've done pilates with your
boyfriend, which I have.

04:35.884 --> 04:40.062
All right. The kids are
off to my mom's. How can I help?

04:40.105 --> 04:42.020
No, you're off-duty.

04:42.064 --> 04:45.720
Also, the more you look at this crib,
the more you might consider a divorce.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.723
Yeah, I checked
the color on the web site.

04:48.766 --> 04:52.292
It's called "daddy issues red."

04:52.335 --> 04:54.772
I made a mistake, ok?

04:54.816 --> 04:56.818
Mm-hmm.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.952
Babe, it's... it's a good crib.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.999
It's a good crib.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.481
Prentiss.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.571
Uh, yes, I approved Penelope
Garcia's use of the bau office,

05:10.614 --> 05:13.574
as today she's hosting
a weekend workshop on...

05:13.617 --> 05:15.227
What?

05:15.271 --> 05:17.969
How loud is the music?

05:21.016 --> 05:23.801
You just hacked into
the he-man/woman-hater web site.

05:23.845 --> 05:27.805
In order to run your password sniffer,
you had to drop your firewall.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.522
You have been back-hacked!
What are you gonna do?

05:29.546 --> 05:31.026
So you have, like,
30 seconds

05:31.069 --> 05:33.202
before he broadcasts your I.P.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.683
To all his boys!

05:35.726 --> 05:37.989
Hey, wait. Um, heh!
Look at that.

05:38.033 --> 05:41.341
Oh. You are out,
number 2.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.996
That's pretty good.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.998
That's ok.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.000
You've ruined everything.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.176
You two are doing
good with 4 hands.

05:51.220 --> 05:54.484
Excuse me.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.704
Hey, number 4.
Elizabeth, right?

05:56.747 --> 05:59.247
You were the first across the finish line.
You're really good with this.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.709
Thanks. Think the
workshop has helped.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.581
Uh, I was wondering if
you could show the class

06:04.625 --> 06:08.324
how to use a vpn to mash an
onion router in, say, Romania.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.979
Romania? Yeah, you're
not gonna need that

06:11.022 --> 06:13.024
unless you got
to hide your signal,

06:13.068 --> 06:15.026
I mean, like,
hide-hide your signal.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.420
I know.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.075
Who are you hiding from?

06:20.118 --> 06:23.252
Uh, I have a, you know,
stalker. Heh!

06:23.295 --> 06:26.734
But it's all online,
so it's probably fine, right?

06:26.777 --> 06:31.434
Maybe, probably, but...
Do you need my help?

06:31.478 --> 06:33.958
Maybe...

06:34.002 --> 06:35.960
Probably, yeah.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.136
Yeah? Ok. Um, let's
start with this.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.617
Do you think it's a stalker

06:40.661 --> 06:42.837
or just, like, a troll?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.969
'Cause sometimes it's hard
to tell the difference.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.102
Check for yourself.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.981
It's bad... Right?

06:57.025 --> 06:59.027
Uh...

07:00.507 --> 07:03.510
Yeah. Yeah, it's bad.

07:31.755 --> 07:37.761
Captioning made possible by
abc studios, llc and CBS, inc.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.176
"The only reason why"

07:42.200 --> 07:43.439
"we ask other people
how their weekend was

07:43.463 --> 07:44.744
is so we can tell them
about our own weekend."

07:44.768 --> 07:47.858
Chuck palahniuk.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.512
I sent the rest
of the class home.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.036
Thank you, guys, for coming.
I know you have the day off.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.866
Well, will totally has the sleepover
covered, so I'm happy to be here.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.541
Yeah, and as long as I make
it to dinner with my dad, I'm good.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.456
I mean, we should be able to knock
this out by the end of the day.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.091
Oh. Now, should we bring in
the rest of the team?

08:03.134 --> 08:05.746
Because we do have that
holding us up.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.226
Do you remember, like, 30 seconds
ago, when you thanked us?

08:08.270 --> 08:10.794
Yeah. We were so young then.

08:10.838 --> 08:14.798
Anyway, Elizabeth wise.
Uh, she lives alone, currently single.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.626
Has she gone to the police?

08:16.670 --> 08:18.169
Many times, and they
haven't been able to find

08:18.193 --> 08:20.151
who is doing it,
let alone stop them.

08:20.195 --> 08:23.111
The violent content of the
messages seems to be escalating:

08:23.154 --> 08:25.026
"You ruined
the good thing we had.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.028
You bang everyone else,
but not me."

08:27.071 --> 08:28.812
Sounds to me like an incel.

08:28.856 --> 08:32.337
Ugh. Icky online culture
of the involuntary celibate.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.991
Usually they just stay
behind the screen.

08:35.035 --> 08:37.168
They're too cowardly to have
a personal confrontation.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.996
Yeah, these surveillance photos
really raise the threat level.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.999
I mean, if he knows
her routine this well,

08:42.043 --> 08:43.827
it's got to be an ex-boyfriend.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.046
I've compiled that list.

08:45.089 --> 08:48.049
Tara, jj,
see what stands out.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.572
Ok.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.227
Alvez will be going with me
to Elizabeth's apartment.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.882
Now, she says no one's broken
in, but I'm not convinced,

08:54.925 --> 08:57.624
so let me get her keys
so we can check it out.

08:57.667 --> 09:01.366
And now we will...

09:01.410 --> 09:02.846
Wheels up.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.109
We're not going anywhere.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.459
Shut up, shut up.
Just because you look like that

09:07.503 --> 09:09.960
doesn't mean you can do whatever you
want with this part of your face.

09:09.984 --> 09:13.465
How does prentiss make this look easy?
Ok, come on! Geez!

09:13.509 --> 09:16.164
Mmm, have fun.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.689
Why are we doing any
of this work?

09:19.733 --> 09:22.866
Don't you have so many kids at
this point that the big ones raise

09:22.910 --> 09:25.216
the little ones, like on
those reality shows?

09:25.260 --> 09:26.696
How many kids do you
think we have?

09:26.740 --> 09:29.177
I don't know. 15?

09:29.220 --> 09:32.223
Uh, Emily,
there's someone at the door for you.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.574
All right. Hold my beer.
I got this.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.187
How much has she...

09:39.230 --> 09:41.319
Two glasses,
8 doughnuts.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.321
7 doughnuts!

09:43.365 --> 09:44.801
Ooh.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.239
Emily prentiss?

09:48.283 --> 09:49.414
Yes.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.155
You have been served.

09:51.199 --> 09:54.637
Hey, wait.
How'd you find me here?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.683
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10:08.564 --> 10:11.654
So, your old neighbor
is suing you,

10:11.698 --> 10:14.831
even though you haven't
lived next door to him

10:14.875 --> 10:17.529
in years?
I guess.

10:17.573 --> 10:21.011
Uh, he's named me and the
government as co-defendants

10:21.055 --> 10:24.275
in a fifth amendment
civil rights violation.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.277
He says he's being watched.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.757
Oh, boy.

10:27.801 --> 10:31.326
Ugh. Brian garrity.

10:31.369 --> 10:35.373
He... I think he worked
at a fish hatchery.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.941
He had a wife who was
way out of his league.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.117
Oh, and he had a large cat

10:40.161 --> 10:43.860
that he would walk on
this leash-type thing.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.123
And what do you want
to do about it?

10:46.167 --> 10:49.126
I... I... I want to uber home

10:49.170 --> 10:51.999
and, uh, sober up
and change my clothes

10:52.042 --> 10:55.132
and then I'm going to
call him in to Quantico.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.874
I have to defuse this
before it gets worse.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.963
What? Say it.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.966
He sounds like
a conspiracy theorist,

11:03.010 --> 11:07.579
and we need to be careful of how
much oxygen we give those types.

11:07.623 --> 11:11.105
Please,
Dave, a little credit.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.108
I've talked the guns out
of hands of psychopaths.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.414
I can handle one kook
who hired a lawyer.

11:18.634 --> 11:22.072
Jj,
on phone: Hey, Spence.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.596
Hey, I got Garcia's text.
You guys need me to come in?

11:24.640 --> 11:26.076
No, it's a stalking case.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.817
I think we have
enough hands on deck.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.689
Are you sure? I... i
can totally come in.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.692
All you have to do is say the word.
You know what?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.823
Just say that.
Just say "the word" and I'll...

11:33.867 --> 11:36.173
Say any word and I'll come in.
Want me to come in?

11:36.217 --> 11:38.741
Do you... Want to come in?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
That's a strange haircut.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.571
Excuse me?

11:42.614 --> 11:45.574
I said that's a strange
haircut for a grown man.

11:45.617 --> 11:46.725
Is that me you're talking to?

11:46.749 --> 11:48.751
Most men don't have
hair like that.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.232
Did you know that?
Hey, let me call you right back.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.060
Are you... you lost? You ok?

11:53.103 --> 11:55.192
You have a very slender neck.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.412
It makes your head look big.
Did you know that?

11:57.455 --> 11:59.588
That's why I noticed
the haircut.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.590
Where are your parents?

12:01.633 --> 12:02.591
Can I touch it?

12:02.634 --> 12:03.940
Uh, you know what? Maybe not.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.701
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch this guy.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.509
We don't know him.
Seriously, dude?

12:07.552 --> 12:08.878
I... I was worried
that he was lost.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.425
He asked to touch my hair.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.557
I was trying to not
have him touch my hair.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.037
Oh, no, no, no!

12:14.081 --> 12:15.560
Please, stop, stop, stop!

12:15.604 --> 12:18.215
I was just there
for 30 seconds! No!

12:18.259 --> 12:20.217
Signs are clearly posted,
and once the wheels are

12:20.261 --> 12:22.219
off the pavement, it's
going to the impound lot.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.743
I, uh, I work for the FBI.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.068
Do you think there's
any chance you could

12:25.092 --> 12:27.921
maybe show her some
professional courtesy?

12:27.964 --> 12:30.662
Are you ordering me to let it go?
No, no.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.664
'Cause if you are,
that's a violation

12:32.708 --> 12:34.623
of title 5 code of
federal rules.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.949
If you're trying to intimidate
me, pal, that ship has sailed.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.454
Look, I... I'm not trying to intimidate
you, and I completely

12:39.497 --> 12:41.475
understand that you're just doing your
job, but, I mean,

12:41.499 --> 12:43.719
it's a... it's a mom and a kid.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.721
She's not my mom.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.071
She's my aunt.
You didn't know that.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.334
Address is on the form.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
We're stuck here!

12:53.860 --> 12:55.339
We're gonna die!

12:55.383 --> 12:57.167
Look, buddy, just breathe, ok?
Yeah?

12:57.211 --> 12:58.516
We're gonna be fine. Ok.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.996
Ok? I promise you. No, no.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.519
You having a panic attack? Here.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.347
Let me show you
something. Oh, wait.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.828
Behold, an average penny...

13:05.872 --> 13:09.005
97% zinc, 3% copper.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.616
Now, if you focus all of
your attention to the center

13:11.660 --> 13:14.619
of my hand,
you will create a beam of energy

13:14.663 --> 13:17.622
strong enough to make
this penny...

13:17.666 --> 13:19.450
Disappear.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.452
Wha... how'd you do that?!

13:21.496 --> 13:22.845
What the hell, man?

13:22.889 --> 13:24.455
You hit me with this penny.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.456
I'm sorry.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.457
Ha ha ha!

13:26.501 --> 13:29.156
Sorry. Um...

13:29.199 --> 13:32.507
All right, honey.
Uh, say thank you to this nice man.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.509
Thank you. Um...

13:34.552 --> 13:36.511
I don't know.
Let's just go to the park,

13:36.554 --> 13:40.341
and I will call your mom,
and then I will get my car

13:40.384 --> 13:42.691
and pay for it with
money I don't have. Wait.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.171
Can he come with us? Nope.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.825
Uh, no. No. BOY: Please!

13:45.868 --> 13:47.478
I need to know how you did that!

13:47.522 --> 13:48.653
Please?

13:48.697 --> 13:50.612
Please, please?

13:50.655 --> 13:53.528
Technically, I do have
a free afternoon.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.530
Yes!

13:55.573 --> 13:59.099
Uh, ok, but let's just do
us both a favor up front.

13:59.142 --> 14:02.624
Let's agree not to exchange names or
phone numbers, and then, when he goes,

14:02.667 --> 14:05.409
we can just both go our separate ways.
That sound good to you?

14:05.453 --> 14:06.889
Yes.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.891
Great. All right.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.763
The FBI has, like, what,
35,000 employees?

14:11.807 --> 14:13.417
Did you know that? You know what?

14:13.461 --> 14:15.115
I actually did know that.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.727
So what do we know
about this guy?

14:18.770 --> 14:22.078
His name is Billy hanes.
Elizabeth dumped him 6 months ago.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.864
Exactly when the messages started.
Right,

14:24.907 --> 14:27.518
and he is a twitch streamer,
so he makes his living

14:27.562 --> 14:30.173
playing video games day and
night for an online audience.

14:30.217 --> 14:33.176
Technologically savvy,
so he fits that part of the profile.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.700
Plus she said the break-up was
messy, so he fits the whole

14:35.744 --> 14:37.702
"I'm pissed I'm not
having sex" part, too.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.704
You want to tag-team him?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.706
Ho ho! Come at me, sis.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.015
We met in line
at the grocery store.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.017
She dropped a lemon,

14:48.061 --> 14:51.020
I picked it up,
made a lemonade joke.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.544
Smooth. Why'd you break up?

14:53.588 --> 14:57.113
She was that special blend
of clingy and bitchy,

14:57.157 --> 15:00.377
and I was like, "man, I'm
not puttin' up with this."

15:00.421 --> 15:02.379
Yeah, that's not what we heard.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.946
What'd you hear?

15:03.990 --> 15:06.949
You bought an engagement ring
after 3 months of dating,

15:06.993 --> 15:10.648
and it was a little fast
for her, right? Yeah.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.650
That would be
a little fast for anybody.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.653
What can I say?
I thought it was true love.

15:15.697 --> 15:19.962
It wasn't, so I made sure not
to make the same mistake twice.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.661
Like last night, I was having a
threesome with two fans from my channel.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.316
Mmm. Ok. Can we get their names?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.840
Uh... I can give you
their usernames.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.408
Never got around to
asking the real names.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.410
Oh, but I got photos.

15:33.454 --> 15:34.803
Great.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.980
Just give us a sec.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.635
Enjoy.

15:43.638 --> 15:47.076
Oh, yep. Yeah.
That's a... that's a threesome.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.861
All right.
Who would do that with that guy?

15:49.905 --> 15:53.343
Well, but he doesn't
fit our profile, so...

15:53.387 --> 15:55.867
We're looking for an
involuntary celibate,

15:55.911 --> 15:59.480
and Billy here seems to be
having a lot of the sex.

15:59.523 --> 16:02.483
Well, let's keep him anyway.
He might know something that can help.

16:02.526 --> 16:05.529
Plus, it's Saturday; If we have
to stay here, so does that guy.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.753
Ugh.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.756
I don't know
what I was thinking,

16:14.799 --> 16:18.760
donating our perfectly good
crib and spending money on this.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.023
How did you swing it,
financially?

16:21.067 --> 16:23.373
I mean, you were living
paycheck to paycheck.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.897
But I had different
priorities than you have now.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.378
I didn't have kids...
That I knew of.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.210
So how bad is it?

16:34.254 --> 16:36.908
No, we're good,
we're good, for now,

16:36.952 --> 16:39.650
but we did some back-
of-the-envelope math.

16:39.694 --> 16:43.132
College tuition... Times 5 kids.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.482
Yeah. Hmm.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.484
What does kristy think?

16:47.528 --> 16:49.486
Kristy thinks we'll
figure it out.

16:49.530 --> 16:52.707
There's student loans,
there's state school.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.709
Can I see it? See what?

16:54.752 --> 16:56.711
Well, the envelope,
the... the numbers.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.191
No, absolutely not.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.758
Hey, come on, come on, come on.
It's uncle Dave.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.762
All right.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.857
Is this a real number?

17:16.644 --> 17:19.212
What's going on here?
Why is everyone working?

17:19.255 --> 17:21.214
Oh. Stalking case.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.215
I texted you 28 minutes ago.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.020
Alvez and I are going to
the victim's apartment.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.482
Oh, you did. I'm sorry.
Uh, just a little distracted.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.658
Because of that guy
in your office?

17:30.701 --> 17:32.225
He's already here? Yeah.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.227
He was escorted in
20 minutes ago.

17:34.270 --> 17:37.230
And what is that
thing he brought with him?

17:37.273 --> 17:41.277
His own crime board,
and it is complete with crazy-man string.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.627
Oh, um...

17:43.671 --> 17:45.629
Open. "Ah."

17:45.673 --> 17:46.891
Ah.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.329
You're gonna need that.
You have wine breath.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.254
Well, well, well.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.256
Long time, no see.

18:03.299 --> 18:07.347
Please, come into
your FBI office.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.827
Good luck, boss.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.926
How did he get past that?

18:21.970 --> 18:24.929
Probably didn't.

18:24.973 --> 18:29.238
My guess is he hijacked an already
existing device... the camera,

18:29.282 --> 18:32.111
like, her cell phone,
or her computer... which means

18:32.154 --> 18:36.071
that Elizabeth just revealed her whole
life to him without even knowing.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.381
Hey, that's good news. No.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.383
No, this is not good news.
This is terrible news.

18:43.426 --> 18:46.560
This means that he's not piggybacking
off an already existing device.

18:46.603 --> 18:49.084
This means he put
his own listening thing

18:49.128 --> 18:51.217
or a camera in here.
He was in here.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.220
Oh, that means we can find
some physical evidence,

18:53.262 --> 18:55.221
and that's good news.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.267
Ok, I'll give you that.
That's your one for today.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.472
There's something under the bed.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.996
Help me move the bed. Yeah.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.098
Ew. What is that?

19:47.142 --> 19:50.580
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.496
He's been stalking
her from in here.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.245
I mean, let's start
with the obvious.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.769
This unsub would have
to have a key, or 4,

20:05.813 --> 20:07.771
to get into Elizabeth's
apartment and plant this.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.382
And then take pictures.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.775
Elizabeth's been locked
up tight for 6 months.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.777
She would have seen
anyone coming and going.

20:13.821 --> 20:16.780
Correct,
and we know that because of this,

20:16.824 --> 20:20.044
which is a hard drive inside a
box with its own transmitter.

20:20.088 --> 20:23.047
Alvez and I found this in that
coffin thing of the unsub's.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.527
With... what was he storing on it?

20:24.571 --> 20:27.051
Everything about Elizabeth
and Billy's relationship.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.228
Their mundane moments,

20:29.271 --> 20:30.707
their fights, their...

20:30.751 --> 20:34.102
Babe, slow down there.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.104
And this goes on
for 23 more minutes.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.280
Got it. Got...
We're good. Thank you.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.935
And what's weird on top of
weird is that all that listening

20:40.978 --> 20:43.590
and watching, it abruptly
stopped 6 months ago.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.723
When they broke up for good.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.073
Yeah, and that's when
the violent messages started.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.075
Now, are we sure
that it's not Billy?

20:51.119 --> 20:53.252
I mean, the timeline
matches up perfectly,

20:53.295 --> 20:55.254
and he was in and out
of the apartment.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.275
Yeah, but he's not connected
to the messages in any way,

20:57.299 --> 20:58.735
and he's a gamer,
not a carpenter.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.539
He couldn't have cut a hole
in the floor like that.

21:00.563 --> 21:03.044
It seems to me the
unsub waited for Billy to be

21:03.087 --> 21:05.046
out of the picture before
he made himself known.

21:05.089 --> 21:08.528
Right, and becoming more and more
insistent that she pay attention to him.

21:08.571 --> 21:11.052
I mean, look, maybe she
rejected him in some way,

21:11.095 --> 21:13.535
some innocuous interaction that
he took as a personal affront.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.535
Yeah,
we need to talk to Elizabeth again.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.101
I can do it.
Please, let me do it.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.079
I can ask those questions,
and she's freaking out already.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.386
The last thing she needs is some
random person who won't understand,

21:21.410 --> 21:24.171
making her feel bad about something
she's already really scared about.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.197
Ok, sure.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.243
Fine.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.207
Stripped the screw.

21:36.251 --> 21:38.229
Give me 5 minutes.
I'm gonna run to the hardware store.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.255
Take your time.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.791
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me do that.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.316
Mmm. Feel free,
but these are all for me.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.796
This baby's gonna be chunky.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.886
You know, I don't want to pry,

22:02.930 --> 22:06.368
but I was just curious
what... This is.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.892
Aw, "the Simmons stories."

22:08.936 --> 22:11.547
I love those. Go ahead.

22:11.591 --> 22:15.551
When, uh, when Matt would come home
from his international travels,

22:15.595 --> 22:19.555
he'd tell the kids these amazing
stories about everything he saw.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.079
And I begged him
to write them down,

22:22.123 --> 22:25.082
and he fought me at first,
but then he discovered

22:25.126 --> 22:27.824
that the kids loved them even
more when he read them out loud.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.349
Well, that's a good dad
right there.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.873
That's what I fell in love with.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.574
And that doesn't explain
the traffic cameras

22:38.618 --> 22:41.795
pointed at me that
the FBI uses to surveil me.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.579
They are not pointed at you.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.581
And you know where else
I found them?

22:45.625 --> 22:48.149
In my smart TV,

22:48.192 --> 22:52.327
so any time I'm watching
something, my TV's watching me?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.329
Cui bono, Emily?

22:54.373 --> 22:56.766
That's Latin for "who benefits?"

22:56.810 --> 23:00.030
Yes, Brian, I... i
know what it means.

23:00.074 --> 23:02.598
And yes, there are
cameras around you.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.948
Mm-hmm.
They're around all of us,

23:04.992 --> 23:07.951
but the FBI is not
watching you with them.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.127
Well, isn't it interesting
that the moment

23:10.171 --> 23:12.608
I take steps to expose this,

23:12.652 --> 23:15.132
you decide to sit down
with me? I mean...

23:15.176 --> 23:18.658
I am sitting down with you
because you're suing me.

23:21.182 --> 23:23.140
Please,

23:23.184 --> 23:25.621
have a seat. I'm...

23:25.665 --> 23:27.623
How have you been?

23:27.667 --> 23:29.625
How's Patricia?

23:29.669 --> 23:31.758
Not good!

23:31.801 --> 23:33.455
She left me.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.935
She did?

23:34.978 --> 23:36.458
I'm sorry.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.461
You two were such a... Couple.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.422
Now this is gonna be
an odd question.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.424
Have you been feeling a weird,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.556
burning sensation,
as though you're

23:47.600 --> 23:50.080
being heated from
inside your body?

23:50.124 --> 23:52.909
Yeah, like a
county fair corn dog.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.911
How do you know this?

23:54.955 --> 23:57.261
It's called targeted
individuals.

23:57.305 --> 24:00.264
These are men and
women who are convinced

24:00.308 --> 24:03.354
that they're being watched
all the time, and it

24:03.398 --> 24:06.314
usually happens after a
sudden emotional loss.

24:06.357 --> 24:09.143
I promise, you aren't.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.017
Why did you fake your own death?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.671
What?

24:15.715 --> 24:18.674
In 2010, ya died.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.329
I watched them empty out
your apartment.

24:21.372 --> 24:25.376
Then, in 2016,
you're magically back at the FBI?

24:25.420 --> 24:30.077
I, um, it's... Complicated.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.516
I just thought he was
watching me from outside.

24:34.560 --> 24:38.215
But he was inside,
lying under my bed

24:38.259 --> 24:41.088
in a hole this whole time,
and I had no idea?

24:41.131 --> 24:42.524
Don't think about that, ok?

24:42.568 --> 24:44.918
You have to focus on what
we can do to catch him.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.920
Did someone ask you out
that you said no to?

24:46.963 --> 24:49.139
No,
I don't talk to anyone like that.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.620
It might not have been a
rejection on your part.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.622
No, you don't get it.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.190
I don't talk to anyone.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.845
I... I don't open my front door.

24:58.888 --> 25:01.761
I'm, like, locked
inside my own life.

25:01.804 --> 25:05.547
I... I lay awake all night!
I haven't slept in months!

25:05.591 --> 25:07.854
I'm unsafe in my own apartment,

25:07.897 --> 25:10.770
and I'm not... where do I go?

25:10.813 --> 25:12.772
I... I'll tell you where, ok?

25:12.815 --> 25:14.774
There is an office
down the hall,

25:14.817 --> 25:16.776
and it's got a super-comfy couch

25:16.819 --> 25:18.778
and a really warm blanket.

25:18.821 --> 25:22.303
He cannot get to you
there, I promise, ok?

25:22.346 --> 25:24.305
We are gonna go find him,

25:24.348 --> 25:27.482
and you're gonna hang out there and relax.
Sound good?

25:34.620 --> 25:37.144
So then, yeah,
I decided to parlay

25:37.187 --> 25:41.975
a highly lucrative art history
degree into teaching, so I...

25:42.018 --> 25:43.977
I teach. Art history?

25:44.020 --> 25:47.328
I teach art,
just to first-to third-graders.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.330
Oh, that's amazing.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.201
Amazing? Really?

25:51.245 --> 25:53.552
Would you call turkeys
made out of hands amazing?

25:53.595 --> 25:56.206
I... I would call turkeys
made out of hands amazing,

25:56.250 --> 25:58.557
and I also... I think that the
world needs more teachers.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.124
Good ones, at least.

26:01.168 --> 26:04.214
Ok, what's going on here?

26:04.258 --> 26:07.130
Is this part of some kind
of long-con pickup move?

26:07.174 --> 26:09.132
No. No?

26:09.176 --> 26:11.134
Ok, then what is it?

26:11.178 --> 26:13.136
I'm supposed to have
a normal conversation

26:13.180 --> 26:15.399
today with, uh, a normal person,

26:15.443 --> 26:19.273
and you strike me
as being normal.

26:19.316 --> 26:21.754
What? Ha!

26:21.797 --> 26:24.757
All right, so let me
get this straight.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.759
I'm part of your homework

26:26.802 --> 26:28.761
to locate someone normal.

26:28.804 --> 26:32.286
Well, it sounds weird when you
say it like that, but what I... I...

26:32.329 --> 26:35.594
I've been having this
recurring, uh, workplace dream...

26:35.637 --> 26:37.291
No. Yep. No. Stop.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.772
Just... I don't like it when
people talk about their dreams.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.775
Well, I was... i...
I wasn't going to tell you about my dream.

26:42.818 --> 26:45.299
I was basically just, uh,
talking about my dream

26:45.342 --> 26:48.650
to illustrate the point that dreams
can provide a lot of insight.

26:48.694 --> 26:49.825
To you.

26:49.869 --> 26:52.045
A workplace dream means
there's something

26:52.088 --> 26:53.655
stressful going on
at your work, which

26:53.699 --> 26:55.788
I think you said was
the FBI, so yeah.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.965
FBI stuff, crime, go.

26:59.008 --> 27:03.317
Is it weird
if I don't tell you what I do?

27:03.360 --> 27:06.320
Because this is the first
conversation I've had in a long time

27:06.363 --> 27:10.672
where I'm not defined
by my job, and it...

27:10.716 --> 27:13.370
Is nice.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.200
Max!

27:17.244 --> 27:18.680
Max?

27:18.724 --> 27:22.249
Yes, short for Maxine,
which I hate.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.077
Here you go.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.252
Mom, this is Spencer.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.906
This is your magic penny now.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.429
Aw, thank you.

27:28.472 --> 27:31.171
Why is my child exchanging
money with a stranger?

27:31.214 --> 27:34.000
It's a long story,
but I... I vouch for him.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.263
Your son is
remarkable, by the way.

27:36.306 --> 27:39.048
Thanks. She's single,
by the way.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.397
Good-bye, Michelle.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.835
It's our father's dream
to marry her off.

27:42.878 --> 27:46.099
There's a super sad dowry,
if that sweetens the pot.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.535
Good-bye, Michelle.

27:47.578 --> 27:50.059
Bye. Bye.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.719
I still don't know
what normal is, but...

27:57.763 --> 28:01.767
This has been nice,
so thank you.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.728
Hey.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.817
That dream of yours...

28:08.861 --> 28:10.210
Yeah?

28:10.253 --> 28:12.952
Do you want to tell me about it?

28:15.955 --> 28:17.913
Oh...

28:21.656 --> 28:24.703
I really want to find this perv,
and I don't know what I'm missing.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.579
Hey, stop for a second.

28:31.622 --> 28:35.931
I know you take our cases
personally, ok, but not like this.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.500
Want to talk about it?

28:43.504 --> 28:45.941
There's this guy,

28:45.985 --> 28:49.728
alexei stanovich, and
he's been bothering me,

28:49.771 --> 28:53.079
messaging me and asking me why
I'm not barefoot and pregnant

28:53.122 --> 28:56.169
and explaining in detail
how he's gonna kill me.

28:56.212 --> 28:59.346
Hey, why haven't you
told anyone about this?

28:59.389 --> 29:02.610
Alexei stanovich lives in St.
Petersburg, Russia, so he's ungettable,

29:02.653 --> 29:06.092
and the thing is, it's not even the
worst thing I have to deal with.

29:06.135 --> 29:10.096
Like, the interactions
I have on the web, I...

29:10.139 --> 29:13.142
It's just part of my job.
How is that possible?

29:13.186 --> 29:15.492
You don't even like to look
at crime scene photos.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.933
I don't think I've ever
told anybody this...

29:20.976 --> 29:24.937
But the reason why I don't
look at crime scene photos

29:24.980 --> 29:27.287
is because I kind of
have my own version.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.464
Sometimes the places on the
web I need to go are riddled

29:30.507 --> 29:33.293
with rape jokes
and racial epithets,

29:33.336 --> 29:36.296
and if you can't
take it, get out

29:36.339 --> 29:39.299
of the chat room,
you stupid, fat b-tard.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.301
I can't stop alexei stanovich,

29:41.344 --> 29:43.303
but this guy...

29:43.346 --> 29:45.914
I'm gonna find this guy.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.335
I can't fully
explain why I left the FBI.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.318
I was undercover.

29:58.361 --> 30:00.842
Emily, I'll make it simple for you.
You have two choices.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.105
You can tell me
the truth now or in court.

30:03.149 --> 30:06.369
Oh.

30:06.413 --> 30:09.372
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.418
Um, do you have a second? Prentiss: Yeah.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.463
If you'll excuse me.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.211
Look, Garcia's in a tailspin

30:22.255 --> 30:24.213
trying to find
Elizabeth's stalker.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.215
It looks like you
are, too. You ok?

30:26.259 --> 30:28.043
No. He's dug in.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.065
Well, that's the problem
with targeted individuals.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.049
You can't convince them
their delusion isn't real,

30:32.091 --> 30:34.571
and the only strategy that
works is just to indulge them

30:34.615 --> 30:38.880
until they're no longer a threat
to themselves or others and...

30:38.924 --> 30:41.361
Why are you looking
at me like that?

30:41.404 --> 30:43.363
Did you notice how he
checked you out?

30:43.406 --> 30:47.062
Yeah, yeah, it felt like I needed
a thick coat or some kind of taser.

30:47.106 --> 30:50.196
That's because you look like
his wife who just left him.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.893
I look like that man's wife?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.808
Somebody married that man?

30:53.852 --> 30:56.289
It's more of
an attitude... strong,

30:56.332 --> 30:58.900
forthright, convincing.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.075
No.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.643
Tara, he's gonna sue me. Please?

31:06.168 --> 31:08.301
You owe me a lot of drinks.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.653
Brian. Hi.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.916
I'm ssa Lewis. Mm-hmm.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.963
I guess you could say I'm
the woman behind the woman,

31:18.006 --> 31:19.965
if you know what I mean.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.705
Oh, yes, I do.

31:21.749 --> 31:24.186
You know,
since you've uncovered so much,

31:24.230 --> 31:26.710
I feel comfortable
leveling with you.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.538
You are being watched...

31:28.582 --> 31:30.540
I knew it.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.846
But not by us.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.023
Think about it.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.249
Shh.

31:43.292 --> 31:45.251
All you need to know

31:45.294 --> 31:46.948
is that it's not the bureau.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.472
But if you move forward
with this court case...

31:49.516 --> 31:51.605
I risk exposing
the wrong people.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.085
Exactly.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.610
Man, Brian, you are a smart guy.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.786
So...

31:58.829 --> 32:02.007
Let's you and I
discuss next steps.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.097
Oh!

32:05.140 --> 32:09.318
Don't... do that! I'm sorry.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.494
I thought I could help,
maybe be another set of ears?

32:13.018 --> 32:14.889
But first...

32:15.890 --> 32:18.327
Oh, it's been hours. Well...

32:18.371 --> 32:20.329
And then
the axe comes down and...

32:20.373 --> 32:22.331
Thank you so much... I wake up.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.986
Ok, so the guy with the
axe... do you recognize him?

32:25.030 --> 32:27.336
No, it's like an anonymous face.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.860
All right, look...

32:29.904 --> 32:32.341
You don't want to tell me what you
do, and that's fine,

32:32.385 --> 32:34.517
but it's very clear to
me that something at work

32:34.561 --> 32:36.693
is really stressing you out.

32:36.737 --> 32:40.523
I mean, last week I did think that my
co-worker got blown up by a mail bomb.

32:40.567 --> 32:44.353
Then the week before that, my best
friend was shot and put into a coma.

32:44.397 --> 32:47.704
Weekend before that,
she and I were in a hostage situation,

32:47.748 --> 32:49.880
so... yeah, I, uh,

32:49.924 --> 32:53.710
I think you might be right
about my job being stressful.

32:53.754 --> 32:56.931
Hey, what's that,
um, that hormone

32:56.975 --> 32:59.890
that gets released,
the fight or flight thing... cortisol.

32:59.934 --> 33:03.546
It seems to me you have to find
a way to ignore that at work.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.896
Remember when you were a kid?

33:05.940 --> 33:08.377
You could just get on
your bike and just ride

33:08.421 --> 33:10.205
until you had to come
home for dinner?

33:10.249 --> 33:12.816
Conceptually, yes,
but practically, no.

33:12.860 --> 33:15.819
Ok, but look,
you understand that people don't really

33:15.863 --> 33:18.126
do that anymore
because somewhere

33:18.170 --> 33:20.563
along the way,
something got lost?

33:20.607 --> 33:21.738
Trust?

33:21.782 --> 33:23.740
Yeah, exactly.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.742
So take today, for example.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.745
I see a strange man
talking to my nephew.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.747
Boom! There goes the cortisol:

33:30.791 --> 33:32.749
Risk, danger, threat.

33:32.793 --> 33:36.275
But then, you performed
a magic trick.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.514
That actually... it wasn't magic.
I just... I took the penny

33:38.538 --> 33:41.019
and I threw it behind his head.
No, not that.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.499
You took time out of your day

33:43.543 --> 33:45.675
to calm down a little boy,

33:45.719 --> 33:48.156
a kid who you didn't know,
who you'd never met before,

33:48.200 --> 33:51.029
and you know what I call that?
I call that decency.

33:52.508 --> 33:53.988
Thanks.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.860
Ooh. Magic penny.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.298
What do you mean?

33:59.341 --> 34:01.474
Oh, my gosh! Not decent!

34:01.517 --> 34:03.476
Worth it, though! Oh, man.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.000
Don't touch me! Oh, my... oh!

34:08.045 --> 34:11.701
Oh! Right in the face!
There! You like that?

34:11.745 --> 34:13.201
BILLY, ON TAPE: No, it's my turn...
Wait.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.183
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you notice that?

34:15.226 --> 34:17.577
Notice what?

34:17.620 --> 34:20.580
No, it's my turn to get a back
rub, not to give one.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.103
Ok, fine.
Where's the clicker? I hate this show.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.583
Here. Take it.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.107
Watch something you want.

34:26.150 --> 34:28.109
Do you see that?
The audio levels.

34:28.152 --> 34:31.025
Aha. Is that consistent
with the other recordings?

34:31.938 --> 34:34.376
Babe, slow down, there.

34:34.420 --> 34:37.074
Hmm.
I can't right now.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.946
Every single one.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.600
Did we do it? Did we find it?

34:40.643 --> 34:42.601
You found it. I found it.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.864
I found it.

34:44.908 --> 34:49.348
Billy's voice is louder than
Elizabeth's in all of the recordings.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.654
Could that be a mistake,
I mean, a faulty recording?

34:51.697 --> 34:53.830
No, absolutely not.
It's intentional. Why?

34:53.873 --> 34:55.982
'Cause the microphone is on Billy's
side of the bed, not Elizabeth's.

34:56.005 --> 34:58.008
It was him he was listening
to the whole time.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.881
The unsub wasn't stalking
her, he was stalking him.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.666
Homophobia runs rampant online.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.668
If he was deeply closeted,

35:05.712 --> 35:08.541
he could have been too scared
to tell Billy how he feels.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.500
But I'm not gay.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.502
Ok, it's... it's not that simple.

35:13.546 --> 35:16.157
Uh, this is a mutual
friend that made a point

35:16.201 --> 35:18.159
to stay in your life
after the breakup.

35:18.203 --> 35:19.682
She got most of the friends.

35:19.726 --> 35:21.162
Billy, come on. You did.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.338
Ok, we don't need
to re-litigate the breakup.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.645
This is someone who is good
at computers and locks

35:25.688 --> 35:27.536
and carpentry; That's how
he was able to do this.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.040
If he's like what you're
saying, why did he go after her,

35:30.084 --> 35:31.651
and why not me?

35:31.694 --> 35:35.829
Because... you live on the fourth floor.
I live on the first.

35:35.872 --> 35:38.788
He did to her what
he couldn't do to you.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.883
Billy, what is it?

35:46.927 --> 35:50.887
Well, he wasn't a friend, but...
Elizabeth had this neighbor.

35:50.931 --> 35:53.368
You remember Hayes,
on the second floor?

35:53.412 --> 35:54.891
He's... he's harmless. He...

35:54.935 --> 35:57.633
No, I thought so, too.
He was a locksmith.

35:57.677 --> 36:00.723
When we started dating,
he told me he was into live-streaming,

36:00.767 --> 36:04.336
and I got the sense that...

36:04.379 --> 36:06.338
He wasn't into
streaming as much as...

36:06.381 --> 36:08.078
He was into you.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.080
Yeah.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.431
I'm going to track down
this Hayes.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.869
Mm-hmm. You guys were right.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.479
We can't let our baby
sleep in this.

36:17.523 --> 36:18.698
Mm-mmm.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.309
Actually, I was talking
to kristy about your

36:21.353 --> 36:23.224
financial situation.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.314
You were? Kristy: Uh, I...

36:26.358 --> 36:28.316
I told him we don't
take handouts.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.624
Now, my idea is more in the
"teach a man to fish" vein.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.235
I... I was looking at some
of your journals.

36:34.279 --> 36:37.325
"The Simmons stories"?

36:37.369 --> 36:39.501
I did those as a lark
for the kids.

36:39.545 --> 36:42.025
Hey, there's a talent
there, and that talent

36:42.069 --> 36:44.593
could be the answer
to your problems. How?

36:44.637 --> 36:48.118
I've made a very good living
writing true-crime novels

36:48.162 --> 36:51.339
from our cases, but it's
time to pass on the Baton

36:51.383 --> 36:53.341
to you.

36:53.385 --> 36:56.736
Write a book?
I... I wouldn't even know where to start.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.041
That's where I come in.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.652
You'd be doing me a favor.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.611
We'd both get paid,
and I don't have to do half the work.

37:04.134 --> 37:06.180
Say yes.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.748
Say yes. Yes.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.664
And thank you. Thank you.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.666
Fantastico! Mwah!

37:13.709 --> 37:15.687
Ha ha! And my name will
still be first on the cover.

37:15.711 --> 37:16.843
Ok.

37:16.886 --> 37:20.542
Oh! Oh, my.

37:20.586 --> 37:21.935
What is it? Is that...

37:21.978 --> 37:24.459
Yeah, uh, my water just broke.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.571
You know, I don't normally
wear stuff like this,

37:29.595 --> 37:31.510
but I think I look pretty cool.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.513
Yeah, I think, uh,
triple-x is a good look for you.

37:34.556 --> 37:37.516
Heh heh! Do you feel normal?

37:37.559 --> 37:42.477
No, not in the slightest,
but I feel decent, so...

37:42.521 --> 37:44.653
Sorry.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.353
Kristy's in labor.

37:48.396 --> 37:50.355
Who's kristy? My... my friend's wife.

37:50.398 --> 37:53.314
I, uh, should probably go.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.969
I... look, I know that we
said no, uh, names

37:56.012 --> 37:58.450
and no phone numbers, but...

37:58.493 --> 38:01.975
I would really like to
do this again sometime,

38:02.018 --> 38:05.239
preferably... with you.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.722
So, uh...

38:09.765 --> 38:13.639
What do you do for
the FBI, for real?

38:13.682 --> 38:15.641
I'm a profiler.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.121
I use psychology to find people.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.080
Good.

38:20.123 --> 38:22.125
Find me.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.267
So did you call your lawyer?

38:33.311 --> 38:35.574
Yes. We're dropping the
case against the FBI,

38:35.617 --> 38:38.577
but the NSA,
that's gonna be a tough nut to crack.

38:38.620 --> 38:43.103
Do you know anybody over there,
a deep throat who could deep-throat me?

38:43.146 --> 38:46.280
Uh, no, um, no, I don't,

38:46.324 --> 38:49.762
but this is my friend,
Dr. Hoyer, and he

38:49.805 --> 38:52.634
can definitely put you in
touch with people who can help.

38:52.678 --> 38:57.987
Finally, someone
who gets it. Ha ha ha!

38:58.031 --> 39:01.077
Let's talk about psychotronic weapons
'cause that's where they get you.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.529
Heh! I love him.

39:21.837 --> 39:23.230
We got him.

39:23.273 --> 39:25.232
Oh! Ha ha!

39:25.275 --> 39:26.712
Thank you so much.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.061
Red!

39:28.104 --> 39:29.889
Yeah. You chose red?!

39:29.932 --> 39:31.847
What do you want?
The crib, I can... I can...

39:31.891 --> 39:33.849
I can paint it,
I can duct-tape it...

39:33.893 --> 39:36.025
Just burn it, burn it! Ok, ok.

39:36.069 --> 39:38.332
Kristy, Matt,
time to start pushing.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.291
Anything?

39:41.335 --> 39:43.337
No, not yet.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.779
Hey, you.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.346
Moi?

39:53.826 --> 39:58.221
You... took your whole
day off to help Elizabeth.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.180
Elizabeth.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.661
And that was very kind of you.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.665
How about this?

40:06.708 --> 40:09.189
You get a lead
on alexei stanovich,

40:09.232 --> 40:11.060
you keep me on speed-dial.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.540
Deal.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.375
That feel good?

40:21.419 --> 40:22.855
That feel good? Oh.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.422
Aw. Yeah.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.816
It's a girl.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.341
What's...
What's her name?

40:31.385 --> 40:33.343
Her name is Rose Mary Simmons.

40:33.387 --> 40:35.345
Closest we could get to rossi.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.782
Ah! Oh!

40:36.825 --> 40:38.784
It's a beautiful name,

40:38.827 --> 40:41.482
and it goes with
her Rose-red crib.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.136
When can we meet her? Right now.

40:43.179 --> 40:45.660
Kristy can't wait
to show her off.

40:47.183 --> 40:51.144
Wait, wait, wait.
Um, so this is a new look for you.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.493
What do you think?

40:52.537 --> 40:54.539
I like it.

40:54.582 --> 40:58.368
But what did you do on a
Saturday to get you into it?

40:58.412 --> 41:00.849
Just, uh...

41:00.893 --> 41:03.112
I had a conversation.

41:04.592 --> 41:07.421
Oh... conversation.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.903
Well, whoever this
conversation was with...

41:10.946 --> 41:15.037
Just put a smile on your face I
haven't seen in a really long time.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.045
So...

41:23.089 --> 41:25.720
You know, there's only so many people
they can fit in the delivery room,

41:25.744 --> 41:27.702
so... I'll wait. I, uh,

41:27.746 --> 41:29.922
I should say hello to the baby.

41:29.965 --> 41:33.447
And you will, you know,
a... a week from now.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.276
The baby will still be a baby

41:36.319 --> 41:40.759
and will have two very tired
parents that will want your help.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.325
Yeah?

41:43.805 --> 41:45.285
Yeah.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.811
Go.

42:30.112 --> 42:32.114
Took you long enough.

42:51.438 --> 42:54.484
