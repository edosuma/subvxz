WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.586
Previously on Grimm...

00:04.838 --> 00:08.433
You are such a special man.
But I can't.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.759
Black Claw wants to take
control of the government,

00:10.761 --> 00:12.521
and they're starting
in Portland with Renard.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.390
Have you noticed any
changes in Adalind?

00:14.473 --> 00:16.190
The suppressant you
gave her won't last.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.893
And if she becomes
a Hexenbiest again,

00:17.976 --> 00:19.102
she will not be
who you know now.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.698
Daddy.
Diana?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.056
Don't drink and drive.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.901
How am I
supposed to get home?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.437
Is Kelly asleep?

01:40.017 --> 01:42.736
Finally. Though,
I think he's teething.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.489
Already?
Yeah, I think.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.195
I'm not sure. I've never
really gotten this far before.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.905
How's work going?

01:53.864 --> 01:56.208
Okay. Feels good
to be back.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.535
Is Kelly liking it?

01:59.703 --> 02:01.797
Yeah, we make
a pretty good team.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.215
He makes some pretty
tough clients relax,

02:04.291 --> 02:05.918
they kind of forget
about their problems.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.353
Maybe I should bring him
to the precinct.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.387
I'm sure he'd love a little
detective-man-dad time.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.475
Which I wouldn't
mind myself,

02:18.138 --> 02:20.857
except substituting
dad with lover.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.484
Yeah. I guess we've both been
a little too busy lately.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.155
Yeah.

02:27.230 --> 02:31.235
I know things have been a
little tense, and I'm sorry.

02:32.069 --> 02:36.199
This isn't the easiest relationship
because of how we started.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.994
Trust isn't
a natural thing for us,

02:42.746 --> 02:44.965
but I think we need
to work on that.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.268
This is not stopping here.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.714
Oh!

03:34.631 --> 03:38.807
Hey, hey, you got to help me.
I had an accident.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.353
"Had an accident"?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.518
Man, you are an accident.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.024
Oh, uh...
What are you doing?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.317
I'm calling 911.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.854
Man, don't call nobody.
Put your phone away.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.780
We gone.
Hey, where you going?

03:50.856 --> 03:52.233
You have to help me,
please!

04:30.479 --> 04:31.571
Hank?

04:33.648 --> 04:34.740
Zuri.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.405
How are you?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.408
Good. How are you?
I'm fine.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.758
What are you doing
on this side of town?

04:42.824 --> 04:46.545
I have a client over here.
I still do physical therapy.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.505
By the way,
how's your ankle?

04:49.331 --> 04:50.378
Good as new.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.884
No other problems?

04:53.418 --> 04:54.465
No.

04:58.673 --> 04:59.890
How's your brother doing?

05:00.175 --> 05:03.054
Believe it or not,
he's a sophomore in Eugene,

05:03.136 --> 05:04.513
he's doing really well.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.774
Well, it was good to see you.
Take care of yourself.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.688
Well, Hank, wait.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.489
I've thought a lot about
what happened with us.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.488
I'm really sorry about
the way things ended.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.819
Hey, don't be.
It's okay.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.449
Well, I'd like to
make it up to you.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.997
Really, it's okay.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.702
No, it's not okay.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.209
I mean, when I said, "I
thought a lot about things,"

05:26.284 --> 05:30.039
I thought a lot
about things, so, um...

05:31.665 --> 05:33.008
How about dinner?

05:34.459 --> 05:37.008
Okay, I'll call you.
No, you won't.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.805
Listen, lam not
leaving here

05:38.880 --> 05:40.598
until I know when
I'm gonna see you.

05:40.924 --> 05:44.394
Okay. How about
tomorrow night?

05:45.637 --> 05:49.983
You're on.  Um, I
have a new address, so...

05:53.937 --> 05:55.610
Okay. I'll pick you up.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.449
Or I could make something.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.112
Or you could
make something.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.166
I apologize.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.127
For what?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.303
For what I have to do.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.805
What do you have to do?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.003
Help.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.802
What have we got?

09:13.428 --> 09:16.307
Just reviewing a deposition
on the Ryan case.

09:17.474 --> 09:21.229
But guess who I
ran into last night?

09:22.312 --> 09:24.314
You really want me to guess? No.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.657
Zuri.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.493
Physical therapist Zuri?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.619
Yeah, ran into her
at the grocery store.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.326
And?

09:32.739 --> 09:33.956
She asked me out.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.331
I thought she didn't want to do
the whole Wesen-Kehrseite thing.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.505
Apparently, she was feeling
guilty over that very same thing.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.022
How much guilt
are we talking about?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.334
She's cooking dinner for
me tonight at her house.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.006
That is very guilty.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.797
Yeah, speaking of guilt,

09:49.214 --> 09:52.468
I wonder if the Captain's feeling
any over not being here.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.978
I found this on
my windshield this morning.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.476
I think he's got a real
shot at winning this thing.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.435
If Black Claw starts
controlling politics,

10:02.519 --> 10:04.399
they'll be able to manipulate
the entire system.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.698
And Wesen will control
the whole city.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.155
That would not be good.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.528
Griffin.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.952
Yeah. Uh-huh.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.413
Got it.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.454
That sounds like we're busy.
We are.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.749
Remember to apply it
just before bedtime,

10:24.833 --> 10:27.211
and be sure to wash your hands
before and after you use it.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.636
Thank you.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.597
Eve.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.395
Adalind has
her powers back.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.855
I know.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.026
How long has she
had them back?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.775
I'm not sure.
Maybe three or four weeks.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.448
Does she know you know?

10:48.523 --> 10:49.740
Yes.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.950
Does Nick know?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.656
Yes.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.952
Did Adalind tell him?

10:54.028 --> 10:55.029
No.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.119
You did.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.020
I waited for Adalind
to tell him,

10:59.075 --> 11:01.123
but she didn't,
and I felt I had to.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.581
Has Nick told Adalind
that he knows?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.175
I don't think so.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.255
You were in the tunnel,
weren't you?

11:14.799 --> 11:18.429
Uh, yeah. It wasn't because
of you we didn't come out.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.855
It was because of Adalind.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.352
She didn't know
you were there.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.101
I sensed you, she didn't.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.236
She's out of practice,
Rosalee.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.780
She won't be for long.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.898
You threatened her.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.368
You said if she did anything
to Nick, you'd go after her.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.165
You have a problem
with that?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.285
It's what I would
have said.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.290
If I was Juliette.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.670
Sanitation worker found
him at 7:35 this morning.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.677
He was a little on the freaked-out
side and with good reason.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.054
I know I've said, "This is a
really weird one" before,

11:57.133 --> 11:58.476
but this is
a really weird one.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.102
Is there more than one piece?
No.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.771
Bite marks?
Not that I could tell.

12:01.804 --> 12:05.729
Is there something missing?
Uh, I believe there is.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.482
I don't think there's a bone
left in this guy's body.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.735
Well, this guy got boned.

12:22.533 --> 12:26.629
Well, no wallet,
keys, or phone.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.923
Looks like a crusty
residue around his mouth.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.382
You had to say "crusty."

12:30.458 --> 12:33.086
Okay, I have no idea if we're gonna
get any useable fingerprints.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.569
These are gonna be
pretty distorted.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.844
There is no bone
in the fingers.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.349
Those are tire tracks.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.763
It looks like
he was run over.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.094
Yeah, more than once.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.932
Then somebody took his wallet,
keys, phone, and bones.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.311
This is one sick dude.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.776
Well, let's see if we can
get an ID on the vic

12:48.851 --> 12:50.774
and send him over
to the ME.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.448
Well, this is not the first
flat body on the books.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.694
That's sort of depressing.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.786
One case in Fresno County,
California, January of this year.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.163
Two more cases in Humboldt
County in February.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.337
Well, if he's moving to
Oregon, Portland makes sense.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.791
All right, if there's three cases
this year, there's got to be more.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.126
We should take it back
five more years.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.258
Took a little squeezing, but I
finally got a readable fingerprint.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.385
Our victim is
Kevin Carl Salesky,

13:18.464 --> 13:20.137
and he does have
a bit of a record.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.218
Arrested for a couple
drunk and disorderlies,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.225
public urination,
three DUIs,

13:24.304 --> 13:26.932
the last one resulting in a
vehicular manslaughter charge,

13:27.015 --> 13:28.642
of which he was acquitted
on a technicality,

13:28.725 --> 13:30.022
and that was just last year.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.732
Iran his license.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.491
His car was reported,
about 30 minutes ago,

13:33.563 --> 13:35.531
crashed and abandoned
at Dekum Park.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.155
The graveyard?
That Dekum Park?

13:38.735 --> 13:39.782
It's on the other side
of the river.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.363
How the hell did
he get where he did?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.164
Car's still at the park,
pending investigation.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.241
Blood was found at the
scene, but no body.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.202
Yeah?

13:48.745 --> 13:51.840
Okay, I will do them now.
Send him up to get them.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.114
Assignment reviews have got to be signed.
You guys good?

13:54.584 --> 13:55.585
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.096
So, we got a car
smashed up in the park.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.222
Car could have been stolen before he
was killed or after he was killed.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.601
Or maybe it wasn't
stolen at all.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.178
I mean, this guy's
got three DUIs.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.729
He could have crashed it
on his own.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.726
I'm gonna make sure no one touches
that car before we get there.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.937
Hey, this is Detective Griffin.
Who's the officer on duty?

14:33.331 --> 14:34.457
Hey, Wu!

14:34.791 --> 14:36.384
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.211
Yeah, don't worry.
I got dizzy.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.676
Must have
gotten up too fast.

14:41.756 --> 14:42.956
You might have
low blood sugar.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.165
When was the last
time you ate?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.677
Um...

14:49.889 --> 14:53.939
I think I had something last night.
I'm fine. I'm fine now.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.271
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.776
Look, we're gonna go
check out that car.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.232
Make sure you get
something to eat.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.316
Yep.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.426
Hey, fellas.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.630
Scavengers got here before we
did, stripped it pretty clean.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.966
I got a guy who says
he saw the driver last night.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.759
Not much of a witness,
but he's all we got.

15:25.842 --> 15:26.842
Where is he?

15:26.884 --> 15:28.852
Sleeping in the back
of my car.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.976
I think he kind of had
a rough year last night.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.273
Name's Pinklon Williams.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.521
Pinky?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.852
You know him?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.152
Yeah, I know him.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.234
Pinky!

15:39.730 --> 15:40.982
Wake up!

15:41.107 --> 15:43.307
Oh, no, Detective Griffin, man.
What are you doing here?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.736
I didn't do nothing.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.241
Pinky, you look awful.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.208
I know I do, Detective.
I know I do.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.785
Anyway,
come on out of there.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.620
Am I under arrest?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.080
No.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.164
You know, you were
wearing that jersey

15:56.247 --> 15:57.499
the last time
I arrested you.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.631
Yeah, I've been wearing this
jersey every day since 1999.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.549
Look, this is my man.
This is Scottie Pippen.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.272
This is Trail Blazers.
This is Rip City.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.841
Everybody said that his career
was over when Jordan retired.

16:06.924 --> 16:07.971
They was wrong.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.302
All right, listen,
the sergeant here says

16:09.385 --> 16:11.262
you saw the person
who was driving that car.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.627
I saw a guy who looked like
he went through a windshield.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.187
This him?

16:16.267 --> 16:18.027
Maybe, if you threw him
through a windshield.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.149
Did you talk to him?

16:19.228 --> 16:22.983
Not really. He was
extremely inebriated.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.652
Not that I'm judging. All right,
did you see where he went?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.203
Uh, last time
I saw him,

16:27.278 --> 16:28.825
he was down here
by the trash cans.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.916
So, what'd he do?
Did he say anything to you?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.414
I didn't stick around.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.667
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Do I get, uh...

16:37.747 --> 16:40.967
Like, uh, a reward for all
this pertinent information?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.426
No.

16:42.752 --> 16:43.753
Oh.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.217
Where is that
coming from?

16:49.467 --> 16:50.719
Go on, Pinky,
get out of here.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.269
I got a wallet.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.186
Let's dust it for
prints and see what we get.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.102
There's our guy.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.029
Credit cards and cash
still in there?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.356
Yep.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.656
Wasn't a robbery.

17:04.773 --> 17:05.991
Well, let's talk
to the ME.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.945
See if she's ever seen
anything like this before.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.577
I have never seen
anything like this before.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.832
The entire skeletal structure has
dissolved. I mean, it's gone.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.662
The only way
I can explain it is,

17:17.744 --> 17:19.667
I found a high level of
chitinase throughout the body.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.589
And chitinase is what?

17:21.665 --> 17:24.385
A digestive enzyme
usually found in bats.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.679
The only other thing I found
in his system was alcohol.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.048
A lot of it.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.882
But that doesn't
dissolve bones.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.501
What about all the
crusty stuff around his mouth?

17:32.635 --> 17:35.764
I believe that's
liquefied bone.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.186
So, somehow
he regurgitated

17:38.266 --> 17:40.985
his entire skeletal
structure out of his mouth?

17:41.769 --> 17:45.819
It's a possibility, but I'm not
gonna put that in my report.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.448
Sorry, guys, I wish
I could be more help.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.165
What is this? I gave you $40.
This is only $20 worth.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.241
What are you doing?

17:55.324 --> 17:56.701
Come on, don't give me that,
give me what I'm paying...

18:35.197 --> 18:37.325
on, God.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.877
Don't rob me, man.
What are you...

18:40.328 --> 18:42.376
I was just shot,
man, call 911...

18:50.546 --> 18:51.763
I apologize.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.433
What? What?

18:55.593 --> 18:57.721
Really. I mean it.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.896
If I didn't have to
do this, I wouldn't.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.112
But I don't expect
you to understand.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.912
No!

20:17.299 --> 20:18.551
Charlie?

20:18.968 --> 20:20.094
Yeah.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.854
Did you bring us
something?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.314
Yeah, Pa.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.650
You are such
a good boy.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.157
What would we ever
do without him?

20:33.983 --> 20:35.360
We'd starve.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.328
I know.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.823
Welcome. Come on in.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.373
Pinot Noir.
I love Pinot Noir.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.964
Yeah, I was hoping
you loved Pinot Noir,

21:35.628 --> 21:37.096
'cause that's what I got.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.423
Well, let's open it.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.555
Here you go.

21:41.634 --> 21:45.264
I hope you like salmon.
I figured that was safe.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.474
Yeah, who doesn't
love salmon?

21:50.059 --> 21:53.734
You know, um, I never
thought this would happen.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.567
Yeah, I didn't either.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.076
So, do you still work
with the Grimm? I do.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.451
Does he know that
you're here tonight?

22:06.534 --> 22:08.582
Well, I told him
we ran into each other.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.246
Yeah.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.423
How long have you two been
working together, now?

22:12.498 --> 22:14.125
Uh, going on
six years.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.925
on.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.346
How are you dealing
with all that?

22:19.421 --> 22:21.014
Well, I try
not to judge.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.555
Well, then, you must
be very open-minded.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.096
What changed your mind?

22:26.428 --> 22:30.058
You know what I am, and you
accept me for what I am.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.568
I was too quick
to overlook that.

22:34.228 --> 22:37.152
Then I just got mad at myself,
'cause I knew I blew an opportunity.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.951
Then when I saw you
in the frozen food section,

22:41.026 --> 22:42.528
I just figured, you know,

22:42.611 --> 22:45.455
well, he really needs someone
to cook him a decent meal.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.580
Well, that works for me.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.504
Okay, well, you can give me
a hand and stir this sauce

22:55.624 --> 22:57.877
while I finish setting the table.

22:59.128 --> 23:02.473
Um... I can do that.

23:09.805 --> 23:13.810
Nick? Nick?
You need to wake up.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.944
What's wrong?

23:17.563 --> 23:19.406
I need to
tell you something.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.650
Okay.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.703
I talked to Sean Renard.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.488
Why?

23:27.031 --> 23:28.203
He called.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.249
He wouldn't tell me
on the phone

23:29.325 --> 23:31.248
what it was about,
he wanted to meet.

23:31.327 --> 23:34.331
It's Diana. He said
she's with the Resistance.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.508
Why would he be
telling you this now?

23:37.583 --> 23:38.584
I don't know.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.422
I think he's gonna use Diana
to get to me for some reason.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.222
I'm sorry. I should
have told you sooner.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.930
We think Renard is
working with Black Claw.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.100
Are you sure?
Yeah.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.463
But he doesn't
know that we know,

23:55.476 --> 23:57.854
and for now,
it's better that way.

23:58.562 --> 24:02.817
I'm scared. If you hear
from him again, tell me.

24:03.859 --> 24:04.951
Okay.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.422
Hey.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.003
So, how was
last night?

24:19.083 --> 24:20.426
Very nice.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.587
But you didn't
sleep with her?

24:22.670 --> 24:23.967
I did not.

24:24.046 --> 24:27.346
Doesn't mean I won't, but we're
just getting reacquainted.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.641
I'm in no hurry.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.938
The Captain
contacted Adalind,

24:33.013 --> 24:34.515
didn't tell me
anything about it.

24:34.932 --> 24:37.731
Okay, what don't I know
that I should know?

24:41.605 --> 24:43.528
Said that Diana is
with the Resistance.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.910
I thought she was with the Royals.
So did I.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.829
If the Captain is working with
Black Claw...

24:48.904 --> 24:50.281
...they're gonna use
Adalind to get to you.

24:50.364 --> 24:53.994
We're associating with some
very unsavory characters.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.123
Wu.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.793
Where?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.092
We got another flat one.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.629
Number 33, that's Pinky.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.882
Bullet wound
to the gut.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.388
The likelihood of him getting
shot here is pretty small.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.310
Pinky never
left that park.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.480
And it's just like
the last one.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.229
Now, I'm thinking our perp
finds his victims in the park,

25:17.307 --> 25:20.060
takes them elsewhere
to run them over.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.023
We need to find out exactly
what we're dealing with.

25:24.273 --> 25:28.779
They stalked places of death,
battlefields, workhouses, and slums.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.197
Barbatus Ossifrage?

25:31.321 --> 25:33.494
Yeah, they prey on
the mortally wounded.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.375
So, they kill
the already dying?

25:35.451 --> 25:36.794
Exactly.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.337
So, technically,
they're not killers.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.039
They sort of serve the same
purpose in the ecosystem

25:40.122 --> 25:41.419
as, like, vultures,

25:41.623 --> 25:44.297
providing clean-up and
recycling of dead bodies,

25:44.376 --> 25:47.095
which, in turn, prevents the
spread of plague and pestilence.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.465
They roam in packs
called tristitudo,

25:49.548 --> 25:51.767
which translates to
"a group of grief."

25:52.134 --> 25:53.727
So, we could be dealing
with more than one.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.145
Definitely,
but the thing is,

25:55.262 --> 25:57.811
unlike vultures, these guys
don't hang around one area

25:57.890 --> 25:59.938
for more than, like,
three or four bodies because,

26:00.017 --> 26:02.816
you know, hauling off a human
corpse is a little more obvious

26:02.895 --> 26:04.238
than, like,
pecking at carrion.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.860
Were the bodies dropped
from a high place?

26:05.939 --> 26:07.191
Because they'd have
to break the bones

26:07.274 --> 26:09.234
before they could dissolve
them and suck them out.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.073
Our bodies were run over.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.373
Well, I guess that's a sacrifice
you have to make when you don't

26:14.448 --> 26:15.449
have a cliff.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.751
Both of our victims were
taken from Dekum Park.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.703
Well, then the
Barbatus Ossifrage

26:19.787 --> 26:21.505
is probably scavenging
Dekum Park.

26:21.622 --> 26:22.589
That's where you're
gonna find him.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.086
We have no idea
who this guy is.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.793
He has no relationship
with the victims.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.171
How can you even arrest this
guy for murder, anyway?

26:28.504 --> 26:30.927
I mean, he didn't
kill anybody.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.303
I guess he helps it along.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.760
He's an accessory, and he
screws up our crime scenes.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.265
There's no way we'll be
able to get a conviction

26:36.345 --> 26:37.392
with a boneless body.

26:37.471 --> 26:38.939
I don't know how you're
gonna find an Ossifrage

26:39.014 --> 26:40.015
without another body.

26:40.516 --> 26:44.191
Well, it says here that they're
attracted to the smell of blood.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.605
Not just
the smell of blood,

26:45.687 --> 26:47.485
it has to be the scent
of imminent death.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.441
Maybe we can borrow
a body from the morgue.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.651
That won't be enough.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.078
The victim is gonna have
to smell like it's alive.

26:53.487 --> 26:56.036
So, we have to find someone
who's alive, but dying?

26:56.657 --> 26:58.204
How are we gonna do that?
Well,

26:58.867 --> 27:01.120
there is something called
the Parfum de la Mort,

27:01.203 --> 27:02.671
it's the scent of dying.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.794
You know, if you get me a body,
I could probably make that up.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.463
Well, I guess one
of us could do it.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.545
Any volunteers?

27:14.883 --> 27:15.884
Oh, no.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.098
No, no, no,
wait a minute.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.472
I've already done
this once before.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.808
Well, technically, no, you
don't have to ingest anything

27:21.890 --> 27:24.188
that's gonna actually
risk your life.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.315
Sweetie, you just
have to lay there

27:25.394 --> 27:27.271
and endure
the Parfum de la Mort.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.106
How bad is it?

27:29.189 --> 27:31.612
It's no worse than
certain cheeses.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.160
When do you want
to do this?

27:35.946 --> 27:37.198
Tonight.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.341
- Hello?
- Can you talk?

27:48.417 --> 27:49.543
Yeah.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.424
I need to see you
tonight, alone.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.221
Don't bring Kelly
or anybody else.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.640
Well, what am I
supposed to tell Nick?

27:55.716 --> 27:56.808
Well, I heard
you're working again.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.924
Why don't you tell him you're
meeting with a client?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.562
Is this about Diana?

28:00.762 --> 28:04.016
I'll text you where and when.
Don't be late.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.114
Hey, is that stuff
just about done?

28:53.398 --> 28:55.617
No, no, no. You
don't want to... Oh!

28:56.151 --> 28:59.280
Oh, my God. You do not want
to breathe this stuff.

28:59.655 --> 29:02.625
Thank you. Thank you for that.
Just make it stop.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.413
I'm almost done.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.921
- Is it ready?
- Almost done.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.217
No. No. No.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.050
- Just wait a second, you guys.
- She's almost done.

29:21.426 --> 29:25.727
I'm so sorry. This stuff
is really potent.

29:25.806 --> 29:29.936
That is unlike anything
I have ever smelled before.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.270
Okay, here.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.696
Don't spray this
until you have to

29:33.772 --> 29:37.242
and only on his clothes,
not on his skin.

29:37.317 --> 29:40.992
And you need to wear these.
It's not fresh blood, but...

29:42.030 --> 29:44.158
If there are any Barbatus
Ossifrage in the area,

29:44.241 --> 29:46.960
trust me, you will
get their attention.

29:47.536 --> 29:48.583
You ready?

29:48.662 --> 29:50.164
Can we get this
over with?

29:53.375 --> 29:55.002
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.381
Remember, take off your clothes
before you come in the house

29:58.463 --> 30:00.744
and go directly to the shower,
I think that would be best.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.017
All right.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.813
- Spice & Tea.
- Oh, hey, it's me.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.360
I have a big favor
to ask of you.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.443
I have a meeting tonight, and
I know Nick's working late,

30:15.522 --> 30:16.569
and I was just wondering

30:16.648 --> 30:19.048
if there's any way you can watch
Kelly for a couple of hours?

30:19.067 --> 30:22.071
Sure.
Should I come right over?

30:22.154 --> 30:23.872
Um...

30:28.243 --> 30:30.996
No, no, no.
I'll bring him to you.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.925
Oh, okay. Then I'll get cleaned up, then.
See you in a few.

30:41.590 --> 30:42.933
All right.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.930
This is good enough.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.604
Okay. Can you
hold this, please?

30:53.769 --> 30:55.612
You guys might want to,
you know, clear.

30:56.605 --> 30:57.822
Thank you.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.363
Ugh!

31:05.614 --> 31:10.040
Oh, my God. I can feel how
bad this stuff smells.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.291
Time to go.

31:29.930 --> 31:30.977
Yes.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.824
Hi.
Hi.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.153
I can't thank you enough
for doing this.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.822
Gosh, I should
be thanking you.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.826
It really should only
take a couple of hours.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.627
Don't even worry about it.
Take your time.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.875
Kelly and I have
a lot to talk about.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.500
Yes, you, we do,
don't we?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.468
We do.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.430
How are things at work,
going back?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.258
Oh, good.

32:06.341 --> 32:09.470
I mean, I like not being
at the loft all day,

32:09.553 --> 32:11.897
and I think it's good for Kelly
to get out and meet other people.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.687
Yeah. I just couldn't be
without him right now.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.144
I know, I think
if I ever have a baby,

32:17.227 --> 32:19.070
I'd want to bring
him to work, too,

32:19.146 --> 32:21.319
so, this will be a good test run, huh?

32:23.817 --> 32:25.160
How are things
with you and Nick?

32:25.360 --> 32:29.240
Uh, I haven't told him,
if that's what you're asking.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.331
Every time I'm about to, I just
freeze up, and nothing comes out.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.378
You can't keep it
from him forever.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.004
I know.

32:38.915 --> 32:42.010
Uh, well, everything
you need is right here.

32:42.586 --> 32:47.183
And I have my cell,
so, if you need anything...

32:47.257 --> 32:49.885
We're gonna be okay.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.186
Don't worry.
Bye, bud.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.684
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.064
Bye.

32:59.227 --> 33:03.027
Are we gonna have some fun here?
You gonna have some fun?

34:28.567 --> 34:29.568
Oh.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.764
Was that him?
 I don't know.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.690
He didn't take the bait.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.563
Maybe something
spooked him.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.519
All right, where's Wu?

35:05.061 --> 35:06.984
We'd better find out.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.973
Hank! Over here!

35:33.340 --> 35:34.762
I can't
do this anymore.

35:35.425 --> 35:39.726
I can't feed them day after
day, month after month.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.432
What about me?
What about my life?

35:42.891 --> 35:47.192
Doesn't that mean anything to anybody?
I hate them.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.897
They are ruining my life.

35:49.314 --> 35:53.410
I wish that they would
both just die. Damn it.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.070
Don't they see?

35:57.572 --> 36:00.041
Don't they even see
what they're doing to me?

36:03.953 --> 36:05.250
They don't see it.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.216
They never have.

36:11.419 --> 36:15.299
I apologize. I really do.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.430
This isn't something
that I want to do.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.605
I don't have anything
against you.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.682
Believe me.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.107
It's just

36:25.684 --> 36:26.685
who we are.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.782
You can never
get away from that.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.367
You know how they say
you can't go home again?

36:45.412 --> 36:47.005
I don't want to
go home again!

36:54.462 --> 36:56.635
I got him.
I think he's got Wu.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.602
That means he came in from this way.
He's headed that way.

37:00.677 --> 37:03.772
"I'm hungry, I'm hungry,
feed me, Charlie, feed me."

37:03.888 --> 37:05.185
I'm sick Of it.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.685
There's the van!

37:08.601 --> 37:09.841
Police!

37:10.603 --> 37:11.980
Out of the van!

37:17.694 --> 37:18.820
Guys?

37:21.322 --> 37:22.448
Guys?

37:25.869 --> 37:27.086
Stop!

37:27.162 --> 37:29.005
Put your hands
on your head!

37:37.338 --> 37:42.014
Yeah, Barbatus Ossifrage.
We know.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.949
He ran right in front of me.
I couldn't stop.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.654
My parents depend on me.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.616
They're always so hungry.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.623
Tell them that I tried.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.716
He came out of nowhere. I
didn't see him until it was...

38:15.376 --> 38:17.003
Oh, my God.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.713
Oh, sorry, that's me.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.388
Hang in there, Wu. We'll
check in with you at the hospital.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.310
He gonna be okay?

38:28.389 --> 38:31.359
He hit his head pretty hard,
but I think so, yeah.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.987
I found a registration for a
trailer in the glove box.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.732
I put a BOLO out on it.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.567
If we find the trailer,
we'll find his parents.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.742
Yeah.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.994
So, what do you want
to do about Monroe?

38:42.946 --> 38:45.244
He's not coming in our car.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.659
I'll call him a cab.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.809
Adalind.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.361
I'm sorry it has
to be this way.

39:23.444 --> 39:24.741
What Way?

39:27.323 --> 39:28.415
No.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.837
You bastard.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.712
I know.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.524
Yeah, that's it.
Registration matches.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.664
Hi, I'm Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.418
Oh. No.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.461
Charlie.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.194
Is that Charlie?

40:20.668 --> 40:21.920
I'm hungry.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.174
He was such a good boy.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.810
He took good care of us.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.182
Yes.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.099
That is our Charlie.

40:34.307 --> 40:38.312
God, what happened to him? Looks
like he got hit by a truck.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.820
We're very sorry
for your loss.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.864
Could we have a few
moments alone with him?

40:46.110 --> 40:47.453
Of course.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.724
Can't let this
go to waste.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.676
You're right.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.810
He'd want it this way.
You go first.

41:19.519 --> 41:21.521
But leave some for me.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.947
You hear something?
Yeah.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.042
You don't think
they're...

41:34.242 --> 41:35.994
You think
we should stop them?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.089
Not a chance.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.086
Adalind.
Mmm.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.302
No. Wait.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.569
Diana?
Mommy.

42:01.894 --> 42:02.895
Diana!

42:07.525 --> 42:08.822
I missed you so much.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.114
I missed you, too.
