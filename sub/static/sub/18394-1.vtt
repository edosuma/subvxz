<i>Oh, what a merry Christmas day</i>

00:20.245 --> 00:24.272
<i>Hear the joyous music play</i>

00:24.349 --> 00:28.285
<i>Bells are ringing, choirs singing</i>

00:28.353 --> 00:32.153
<i>Oh, what a merry Christmas day</i>

00:32.223 --> 00:36.251
<i>Sharing the season of good cheer</i>

00:36.328 --> 00:40.264
<i>With the ones we hold so dear</i>

00:40.332 --> 00:44.234
<i>Friendly faces, warm embraces</i>

00:44.302 --> 00:48.102
<i>Oh, what a merry Christmas day</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:52.234
<i>Snowflake-covered country lanes</i>

00:52.310 --> 00:56.212
<i>Jack Frost-painted windowpanes</i>

00:56.281 --> 01:00.411
<i>Twinkling stars on Christmas trees</i>

01:00.485 --> 01:04.387
<i>Oh, what happy memories</i>

01:04.456 --> 01:08.324
<i>Gathered 'round the fireplace</i>

01:08.393 --> 01:12.420
<i>Families filled with love and grace</i>

01:12.497 --> 01:16.433
<i>From the peaceful ember's glow</i>

01:16.501 --> 01:20.301
<i>Blessed yuletide spirits grow</i>

01:20.372 --> 01:24.670
<i>Grow and grow</i>

01:24.743 --> 01:28.907
<i>Joy to the children far and near</i>

01:28.980 --> 01:32.973
<i>What a wondrous time of year</i>

01:33.051 --> 01:36.953
<i>Isn't it just grand to say</i>

01:37.022 --> 01:44.928
<i>Merry, merry Christmas</i>

01:44.996 --> 01:52.698
<i>Oh, what a merry Christmas day!</i>

02:02.881 --> 02:08.080
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to one and all.

02:08.152 --> 02:12.419
Give a penny for the poor, governor?
Penny for the poor?

02:12.490 --> 02:13.479
Bah!

02:16.862 --> 02:20.059
My partner Jacob Marley.

02:20.131 --> 02:22.691
Dead seven years today.

02:22.767 --> 02:27.261
Ah, he was a good one. He robbed
from the widows and swindled the poor.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.736
In his will he left me enough
money to pay for his tombstone.

02:32.811 --> 02:35.974
Ha! And I had him buried at sea!

02:40.051 --> 02:43.953
Oh. G-g-good morning, Mr. Scrooge.

02:44.022 --> 02:46.752
Cratchit! What are you doing
with that piece of coal?

02:46.825 --> 02:51.660
I was, j-just trying
to thaw out the ink.

02:52.497 --> 02:55.125
Bah! You used a piece last week!

02:56.935 --> 03:00.132
Now, get on with your work, Cratchit.

03:00.939 --> 03:04.500
Speaking of work, Mr. Scrooge,
tomorrow is Christmas,

03:04.576 --> 03:07.704
and I was wondering if I could have...
h-half a day off?

03:09.814 --> 03:12.214
Christmas, eh? Well...

03:12.884 --> 03:15.512
I suppose so.

03:15.587 --> 03:18.522
But I'll dock you half a day's pay.

03:18.590 --> 03:22.686
Now, let's see.
I pay you two shillings a day...

03:22.761 --> 03:25.423
Two shillings and a ha'penny, sir.

03:25.497 --> 03:29.126
Oh, yes. I gave you that raise
three years ago.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.135
Yes, sir!
When I started doing your laundry.

03:32.203 --> 03:35.730
All right, Cratchit.
Get busy while I go over my books.

03:35.807 --> 03:39.004
Oh, and here.
Here's another bundle of shirts for you.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.377
Yes, sir!

03:43.848 --> 03:46.316
Let's see, now.

03:46.384 --> 03:50.343
50 pounds, ten shillings from McDuff.

03:50.422 --> 03:54.290
Plus his 80% interest, compounded daily.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.723
Money, money, money.

03:59.764 --> 04:01.823
Merry Christmas!

04:01.900 --> 04:05.165
And a Merry Christmas to you,
Master Fred.

04:05.236 --> 04:06.794
Bah, humbug.

04:06.871 --> 04:10.272
Merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.

04:10.342 --> 04:12.310
What's so merry about it?

04:12.377 --> 04:15.778
I'll tell you what Christmas is:
It's just another workday,

04:15.847 --> 04:20.409
and any Jackanapes who thinks else
should be boiled in his own pudding!

04:22.053 --> 04:27.514
But, sir, Christmas is a time for giving.
A time to be with one's family.

04:27.592 --> 04:29.617
I say, "Bah, humbug. "

04:29.694 --> 04:35.132
I don't care. I say, "Merry Christmas. "
Merry Christmas!

04:35.200 --> 04:37.225
Well said, Master Fred.

04:37.302 --> 04:39.327
Cratchit! What are you doing?

04:40.405 --> 04:45.365
Eh, I was just trying
to keep my hands warm, sir.

04:45.443 --> 04:48.708
Hmm! And what are you
doing here, nephew?

04:48.780 --> 04:54.116
I've come to give you a wreath
and invite you to Christmas dinner.

04:54.185 --> 04:56.153
Well!

04:56.221 --> 04:59.816
I suppose you're going to have
plump goose with chestnut dressing?

04:59.891 --> 05:02.121
- Yeah!
- And will you have plum pudding

05:02.193 --> 05:03.182
in lemon sauce?

05:03.261 --> 05:05.195
Yeah! Boy, oh, boy!

05:05.263 --> 05:09.359
- And candied fruits with spiced sugar cakes?
- Yeah! Will you come?

05:09.434 --> 05:13.302
Are you daft, man?
You know I can't eat that stuff.

05:13.371 --> 05:16.169
Here's your wreath back. Now out, out, out!

05:18.243 --> 05:20.541
Bah! Humbug!

05:21.146 --> 05:23.307
Merry Christmas!

05:24.315 --> 05:26.408
And a "bah, humbug" to you!

05:26.484 --> 05:30.250
That Fred.
Always so full of kindness.

05:30.321 --> 05:33.290
Aye, he always was a little peculiar.

05:33.358 --> 05:35.417
<i>And stubborn.</i>

05:38.930 --> 05:41.728
New customers.
I'll handle this, Cratchit.

05:41.800 --> 05:46.100
Hm. Yes, what can I do
for you two gentlemen?

05:46.171 --> 05:50.403
Sir, we are soliciting funds
for the indigent and destitute.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.306
For the what?

05:52.377 --> 05:54.504
We're collecting for the poor.

05:57.749 --> 06:01.412
Well, um, you realize
if you give money to the poor,

06:01.486 --> 06:03.784
they won't be poor anymore, will they?

06:03.855 --> 06:06.483
- Well, uh...
- And if they're not poor anymore,

06:06.558 --> 06:08.958
then you won't have to raise
money for them anymore.

06:09.027 --> 06:10.119
Well, I suppose...

06:10.195 --> 06:13.722
And if you don't have to
raise money for them anymore,

06:13.798 --> 06:15.925
then you would be out of a job.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.061
Oh, please, gentlemen,
don't ask me to put you out of a job.

06:20.138 --> 06:21.799
Not on Christmas Eve!

06:21.873 --> 06:23.932
Oh, we wouldn't do that, Mr. Scrooge.

06:24.008 --> 06:29.275
Well, then, I suggest you give this
to the poor and be gone!

06:33.952 --> 06:36.580
What's this world coming to, Cratchit?

06:37.722 --> 06:43.285
You work all your life to get money,
and people want you to give it away.

07:03.114 --> 07:05.605
Two minutes fast.

07:09.754 --> 07:13.190
Well, never mind those two minutes.
You may go now.

07:13.258 --> 07:17.092
Oh, thank you, sir! You're so kind!

07:17.162 --> 07:19.687
Never mind the mushy stuff. Just go.

07:19.764 --> 07:22.255
But be here all the earlier the next day.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.200
I will! I will, sir! And a "bah, humbug... "

07:26.638 --> 07:29.698
I mean, a merry Christmas to you, sir!

08:19.057 --> 08:22.959
<i>Scrooge!</i>

08:24.929 --> 08:29.093
Jacob Marley? No, that can't be!

08:34.138 --> 08:35.900
Oh, darn!

09:26.858 --> 09:32.023
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge!</i>

09:32.096 --> 09:34.087
Go away!

09:34.899 --> 09:38.801
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge...</i>

09:44.175 --> 09:46.700
<i>Gosh! Kind of slippery!</i>

09:50.214 --> 09:52.910
Scrooge, don't you recognize me?

09:52.984 --> 09:56.181
I was your partner, Jacob Marley.

09:58.256 --> 10:01.248
Marley. It is you.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.726
Ebenezer, remember when I was alive,

10:04.796 --> 10:07.629
I robbed the widows
and swindled the poor?

10:07.699 --> 10:12.159
Yes, and all in the same day.
Oh, you had class, Jacob.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.897
Yep!

10:13.971 --> 10:16.963
No! No! I was wrong!

10:17.041 --> 10:23.446
And so as punishment, I'm forced to carry
these heavy chains through eternity.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.808
Maybe even longer.

10:26.884 --> 10:31.617
There's no hope! I'm doomed! Doomed!

10:31.689 --> 10:37.218
And the same thing will happen to you,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

10:37.295 --> 10:42.426
No! No, it-it can't! It mustn't!
Help me, Jacob.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.459
Tonight you will be visited by three spirits.

10:47.171 --> 10:50.038
Listen to them. Do what they say.

10:50.108 --> 10:53.134
Or your chains will be heavier than mine.

10:53.878 --> 10:57.041
<i>Farewell, Ebenezer.</i>

11:02.620 --> 11:05.851
<i>Farewell...</i>

11:05.923 --> 11:07.982
Marley! Watch out for that first...

11:13.364 --> 11:14.353
...step.

11:31.182 --> 11:33.616
Spirits.

11:39.390 --> 11:40.379
Humbug.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.778
What, what, what?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.782
W-What?

12:09.854 --> 12:14.291
Well! It's about time.
Haven't got all night, you know.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.519
Who... Who are you?

12:16.594 --> 12:19.461
Why, I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.998
Oh. I thought you'd be taller.

12:25.069 --> 12:28.630
Humph! Listen, Scrooge,
if men were measured by kindness,

12:28.706 --> 12:31.800
you'd be no bigger than a speck of dust.

12:33.211 --> 12:37.238
Ha! Kindness is of little use in this world.

12:37.315 --> 12:39.283
You didn't always think so.

12:39.350 --> 12:41.511
Come on, Scrooge, it's time to go.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.577
Then go.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.127
Spirit! What... what are you doing?

12:51.195 --> 12:53.254
We're gonna visit your past.

12:53.331 --> 12:57.028
I'm not going out there. I'll-I'll fall.

12:57.101 --> 12:58.864
Just hold on.

12:58.936 --> 13:02.201
Not too tight now.

13:08.513 --> 13:10.606
Spirit, look out!

13:17.588 --> 13:19.715
What's wrong, Scrooge? Hee-hee-hee.

13:32.003 --> 13:34.870
Spirit, I believe I know this place.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.533
Yes! It's old Fezziwig's.

13:39.644 --> 13:42.477
I couldn't have worked for a kinder man.

13:50.154 --> 13:52.748
Why, it's old Fezziwig himself!

13:52.823 --> 13:56.122
And all of my very dearest friends!

14:01.098 --> 14:05.194
And that shy lad in the corner. That's me!

14:06.237 --> 14:11.573
Yes. That was before you became
a miserable miser, consumed by greed.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.337
Well, nobody's perfect.

14:13.411 --> 14:17.438
And there! There's lovely Isabelle!

14:19.951 --> 14:21.748
Ebenezer?

14:21.819 --> 14:24.515
- Ebenezer?
- Yes, Isabelle?

14:24.589 --> 14:27.615
My eyes are closed, my lips are puckered

14:27.692 --> 14:30.752
and I'm standing under the mistletoe.

14:31.529 --> 14:34.054
You're also standing on my foot.

14:58.723 --> 15:03.160
Ah! I remember how much
I was in love with her.

15:05.096 --> 15:08.031
In ten years time,
you learned to love something else.

15:08.099 --> 15:11.034
Why... why, it's my counting house.

15:11.102 --> 15:15.095
9,972... nine thousand...

15:15.172 --> 15:17.231
Ebenezer.

15:17.308 --> 15:19.538
Yes, what is it?

15:19.610 --> 15:23.273
For years I've had
this honeymoon cottage, Ebenezer.

15:23.347 --> 15:26.839
I've been waiting for you
to keep your promise to marry me.

15:26.917 --> 15:30.853
Now I must know:
Have you made your decision?

15:30.921 --> 15:34.618
I have! Your last payment
on the cottage was an hour late!

15:34.692 --> 15:37.160
I'm foreclosing the mortgage!

15:42.333 --> 15:45.734
You loved your gold more than
that precious creature,

15:45.803 --> 15:48.169
and you lost her forever.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.640
<i>9970...</i>

15:54.512 --> 15:55.501
...three.

15:56.347 --> 16:01.444
Please, Spirit, I can no longer bear
these memories. Take me home.

16:01.519 --> 16:04.818
Remember, Scrooge, you fashioned
these memories yourself.

16:12.430 --> 16:16.867
Why was I so foolish? Why? Why?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.994
<i>W-What's this?</i>

16:20.071 --> 16:23.507
<i>Fee! Fi! Fo!</i>

16:23.574 --> 16:25.804
<i>Fum! I smell...</i>

16:25.876 --> 16:28.436
I mean, I smell...

16:31.182 --> 16:33.207
...a stingy little Englishman!

16:33.984 --> 16:36.248
<i>I think I do.</i>

16:37.555 --> 16:40.080
Yeah, I do.

16:40.157 --> 16:42.648
Please let me go. Don't eat me.

16:43.728 --> 16:47.323
Why would the Ghost of
Christmas Present - that's me -

16:47.398 --> 16:50.856
want to eat
a distasteful little miser like you?

16:50.935 --> 16:55.565
Especially when there are so many
good things to enjoy in life. See?

16:56.140 --> 16:59.439
Mince pies!

16:59.510 --> 17:03.310
Turkeys! Suckling pig!

17:03.380 --> 17:07.248
And don't forget the chocolate pot roast
with "pisnachio. "

17:07.318 --> 17:09.047
Duh, with "pisnachio. "

17:09.119 --> 17:11.281
<i>Duh, with...</i>

17:11.355 --> 17:13.289
Uh, with yogurt.

17:13.357 --> 17:15.325
But where did all this come from?

17:15.392 --> 17:17.622
From the heart, Scrooge.

17:19.296 --> 17:24.131
It's the food of generosity, which you
have long denied your fellow man.

17:24.201 --> 17:26.431
Generosity, ha!

17:27.905 --> 17:30.806
Nobody has ever shown me generosity.

17:30.875 --> 17:34.003
You've never given them reason to.

17:35.479 --> 17:37.640
And yet...

17:37.715 --> 17:41.116
there are some who still find
enough warmth in their hearts

17:41.185 --> 17:42.982
even for the likes of you.

17:43.053 --> 17:47.820
No acquaintance of mine, I assure you!

17:47.892 --> 17:49.883
Duh, you'll see.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.752
Duh, here we are.

18:25.029 --> 18:27.759
Why did you bring me to this old shack?

18:27.832 --> 18:32.735
This is the home of your overworked,
underpaid employee, Bob Cratchit.

18:36.207 --> 18:38.334
<i>What's she cooking, a canary?</i>

18:38.409 --> 18:41.139
Surely they have more food than that?

18:41.212 --> 18:42.975
Look on the fire.

18:43.047 --> 18:46.312
Duh, what? Oh, that's your laundry.

18:48.686 --> 18:51.917
Not yet, children.
We must wait for Tiny Tim.

18:51.989 --> 18:54.924
Coming, Father. I'm coming.

19:01.699 --> 19:05.635
Oh, my! Look at all the
wonderful things to eat!

19:07.538 --> 19:11.201
We must thank Mr. Scrooge.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.473
Tell me, Spirit:
What's wrong with that kind lad?

19:15.546 --> 19:20.074
Much, I'm afraid.
If these shadows remain unchanged,

19:20.150 --> 19:24.644
I see an empty chair
where Tiny Tim once sat.

19:28.092 --> 19:30.060
Then that means...

19:30.895 --> 19:32.726
...Tim will?

19:32.796 --> 19:34.923
What... Where did they go?

19:34.999 --> 19:37.399
Spirit! Where are ya?

19:37.468 --> 19:40.528

19:41.538 --> 19:42.698
Don't go!

19:47.611 --> 19:50.273
<i>Where did?</i>

20:06.764 --> 20:11.133
Tell me: What will happen to Tiny Tim?

20:36.894 --> 20:38.987
Oh, no!

20:39.063 --> 20:41.827
Spirit, I didn't want this to happen.

20:41.899 --> 20:45.027
Tell me these events can yet be changed.

20:49.139 --> 20:52.233
I've never seen a funeral like this one.

20:52.309 --> 20:56.245
Aye. No mourners,
no friends to bid him farewell.

20:56.313 --> 21:00.113
Oh, well. Let's rest a minute
before we fill it in, eh?

21:00.184 --> 21:01.742
He ain't going nowheres!

21:11.328 --> 21:16.732
Spirit... whose lonely grave is this?

21:20.604 --> 21:23.095
Why, yours, Ebenezer.

21:23.173 --> 21:26.267
The richest man in the cemetery!

21:27.011 --> 21:29.343
Please!

21:45.896 --> 21:47.523
Please!

21:51.068 --> 21:52.968
Spirit! Let me out!

21:53.037 --> 21:55.130
Let me out! I'll... Eh?

21:55.205 --> 21:57.935
<i>What?</i>

21:58.008 --> 22:00.306
I'm back in my own room.

22:05.215 --> 22:08.878
It's Christmas morning! I haven't missed it!

22:08.952 --> 22:12.046
The spirits have given me another chance!

22:12.122 --> 22:16.855
Ooh, I know just what I'll do!
They'll be so surprised!

22:18.695 --> 22:20.526
Ooh, what a wonderful day!

22:21.331 --> 22:23.993
Oh! There's so much to do!
There's so much to do!

22:30.908 --> 22:33.274
I can't go out like this!

22:34.211 --> 22:36.236
There! That's better.

22:39.383 --> 22:42.216
Merry Christmas to one and all!

22:45.656 --> 22:48.887
Well, bless 'em!
Good morning, gentlemen!

22:48.959 --> 22:51.393
I have something for you.

22:53.197 --> 22:56.689
20 gold sovereigns? Oh, no!

22:56.767 --> 22:59.361
Not enough? Well, all right.

22:59.436 --> 23:02.098
50 gold sovereigns.

23:02.172 --> 23:05.608
- Really, Mr. Scrooge, it's...
- Still not enough? Hee-hee-hee!

23:05.676 --> 23:08.110
Aye! You drive a hard bargain!

23:08.178 --> 23:12.945
Here ya are.
100 gold pieces and not a penny more.

23:14.118 --> 23:17.212
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge. Thank you.

23:17.287 --> 23:20.279
And a merry Christmas to you.

23:30.067 --> 23:32.160
Ah, nephew!

Uncle Scrooge!

23:34.238 --> 23:37.833
I'm looking forward to
that wonderful meal of yours.

Well, I'll be doggone.
You mean you're coming?

23:41.478 --> 23:46.506
Of course I am! You know how much I like
candied fruits with spiced sugar cakes.

23:47.651 --> 23:51.246
I'll be over promptly at two.
Keep it piping hot!

23:51.321 --> 23:54.017
I will, Uncle Scrooge. I will.

23:54.091 --> 23:57.492
And a very merry Christmas to you!

23:58.862 --> 24:00.853
Merry Christmas, and keep the change!

24:02.332 --> 24:04.960
Oh! Wonderful lads!

24:05.869 --> 24:08.167
And now for Cratchit!

24:16.446 --> 24:19.142
Why, Mr. Scrooge!
Ha, m-merry Christmas!

24:20.551 --> 24:21.779

Merry Christmas.

24:24.521 --> 24:26.819
I have another bundle for you.

24:29.126 --> 24:31.219
But, sir, it's Christmas day.

24:31.295 --> 24:36.323
Christmas day indeed.
Just another excuse for being lazy.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.903
And another thing, Cratchit.
I've had enough of this half-day off stuff.

24:41.972 --> 24:44.736
You leave me no alternative...

24:44.808 --> 24:46.742
<i>but to give you...</i>

24:46.810 --> 24:47.868
Toys!

24:47.945 --> 24:50.778
Yes, toys! No, no, no, no, no.

24:50.847 --> 24:53.145
I'm giving you a raise...

24:53.217 --> 24:55.481
and making you my partner.

24:55.552 --> 24:57.019
Partner?

24:58.589 --> 25:01.558
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.354
Merry Christmas, Bob.
