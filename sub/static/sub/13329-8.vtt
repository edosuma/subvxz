WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:09.677
( instruments tuning )

00:09.777 --> 00:12.113
- SO IT GOES G...
- G, B...

00:12.213 --> 00:14.215
GUYS, THE AUDIENCE
IS IN, OKAY?

00:14.315 --> 00:16.717
- SO YOU CAN GO ON.
- HOW MANY?

00:16.817 --> 00:19.587
UH, ONE...

00:21.189 --> 00:23.023
- YEAH, ONE.
- ONE?

00:23.124 --> 00:24.992
- YEAH.
- IS IT MEL?

00:25.093 --> 00:27.128
NO, IT'S NOT, BRET.
ACTUALLY, MEL WAS BUSY.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.363
SHE ACTUALLY REQUESTED
THAT SHE CAN'T COME TODAY.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.566
BUT IF SHE WAS HERE,
YES, WE'D HAVE TWO.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.668
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
WE'RE DOWN TO ONE TODAY.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.638
- ONE PERSON?
- IT'S A BIG GUY
THOUGH, JEMAINE.

00:37.738 --> 00:41.109
HE'S TAKING UP THREE SEATS.
HE'S GOT SHOPPING BAGS
WITH HIM.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.212
- WELL, YOU CAN'T COUNT
THE SHOPPING BAGS, CAN YOU?
- THERE'S THREE SEATS USED.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.980
WHAT, SO THE MAJORITY
OF THE AUDIENCE IS
SHOPPING BAGS?

00:47.081 --> 00:48.982
YEAH, MOST OF THE AUDIENCE
ARE SHOPPING BAGS.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.384
BUT DON'T LOOK
AT IT THAT WAY.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.886
LOOK AT IT THAT THERE'S
THREE SEATS TAKEN.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.922
- YEAH?
- Both: OKAY.

00:55.022 --> 00:58.426
JUST GIVE THIS ONE
BIG GUY WITH THE SHOPPING BAGS
THE BEST GIG OF HIS LIFE.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.561
ROCK IT OUT.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.632
( playing )

01:05.933 --> 01:07.835
( sighs )
ONE PERSON.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.438
THIS IS A NEW LOW.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.610
( theme music playing )

01:40.368 --> 01:42.803
* VOODOO LOVER!

01:44.104 --> 01:46.540
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU--

01:46.640 --> 01:49.076
ESPECIALLY THE ONE AUDIENCE
MEMBER FOR COMING ALONG TODAY.

01:49.177 --> 01:52.012
HEY, WHEN DID HE GO?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.114
WHEN DID THAT GUY LEAVE?

01:54.215 --> 01:56.250
YEAH, HE--
HE SNUCK OUT.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.685
POSSIBLY AS EARLY
AS THE FIRST SONG.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.853
SO WE PLAYED THIS WHOLE GIG
TO AN EMPTY ROOM?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.322
TECHNICALLY YES.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.291
WELL, TECHNICALLY
YOU WERE THERE.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.693
TECHNICALLY I ACTUALLY
SNUCK OUT AS WELL.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.329
- YOU SNUCK OUT?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU SNUCK OUT?

02:08.429 --> 02:10.298
I KNEW YOU
WERE GONNA GET ANGRY.
DON'T SINGLE ME OUT.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.566
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUY?
HE SNUCK OUT.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.902
- Bret: HE'S NOT
OUR MANAGER THOUGH.
- I KNOW.

02:15.002 --> 02:18.272
YOU'VE GOT TO
QUESTION YOURSELVES.
WHY IS THE AUDIENCE GONE?

02:18.372 --> 02:21.108
WHY IS THE MANAGER GONE?
WHAT'S HE DOING LEAVING?

02:21.209 --> 02:22.910
WELL, YOU WENT SHOPPING.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.546
OH, YEAH.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.649
ANYWAY, ZERO PEOPLE.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.851
THIS IS A NEW LOW.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.125
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME TO GET
THE HIGH POINTS

02:38.226 --> 02:39.893
AND LOW POINTS GRAPH OUT.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.796
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
AS OF YESTERDAY,

02:42.896 --> 02:44.031
WE'VE HIT
A NEW LOW POINT--

02:44.131 --> 02:46.099
DOING A GIG TO NOBODY.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.336
PASS IT AROUND.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.871
- THAT'S THE GRAPH.
- IT'S AT ZERO.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.773
WOW. WHAT'S THAT
HIGH POINT?

02:52.873 --> 02:55.676
YEAH, THAT'S WHEN I DIDN'T
HAVE TO PAY THE METER.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.346
REMEMBER THE METER
WAS BROKEN WHEN I PARKED
OUTSIDE YOUR APARTMENT?

02:58.446 --> 03:00.214
THAT'S THE HIGH POINT
OF OUR CAREER?

03:00.314 --> 03:03.351
THAT IS THE HIGH POINT
OF US AS A BAND

03:03.451 --> 03:05.085
IN OUR CAREER SO FAR.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.954
I STILL THINK
ABOUT IT NOW.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.722
IT WAS SUCH A GREAT NIGHT.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.791
BUT WE'RE NOT
CONCENTRATING ON THAT NOW.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.961
THOSE TIMES ARE GONE.
WE'RE IN THE LOW NOW.
WE'RE IN THE LULL.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.763
WELL, HOW COME NO ONE
COMES TO OUR GIGS?

03:15.863 --> 03:19.032
I'VE TRIED TO RACK MY BRAINS
TO FIND THAT ANSWER, BRET.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.235
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.671
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T
LOOK COOL.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.273
I-I DO.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.807
- NO YOU DON'T.
- NO.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.643
- DON'T I?
- YOU MAY LOOK COOL
IN YOUR MIND,

03:29.743 --> 03:32.212
BUT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE
ARE LOOKING AT YOU

03:32.313 --> 03:33.814
THEY DON'T SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.883
OKAY?
THEY CAN ONLY SEE
THE OUTER SHELL.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.418
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.019
IT'S ABOUT THE MUSIC,
NOT ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.021
MAYBE IN THE '70s, GUYS.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.156
BUT COME ON, GET UP
WITH THE '90s.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.626
- TIMES HAVE CHANGED.
- IT'S NOT THE '90s.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.829
OKAY, MY POINT IS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
COOL BANDS

03:48.929 --> 03:50.964
AND YOU IS HAIR.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.334
- I'VE GOT HAIR.
- TRUE.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.704
BUT MOST OF YOUR HAIR IS
BODY HAIR, ISN'T IS, JEMAINE?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.138
WELL, SOME OF IT.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.107
LOOK AT THIS.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.377
STYLE.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.547
- I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY.
- UH...

04:06.647 --> 04:08.916
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT.
BUT THIS IS THE STUFF.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.884
STYLING GEL, OKAY?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.720
( sighs )

04:12.820 --> 04:14.322
HAVE A LOOK AT THESE.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.358
Bret:
WHAT'S THIS?

04:17.458 --> 04:18.759
Murray:
JUST SOME EXPERIMENTS I RAN

04:18.859 --> 04:21.261
BACK IN 1991 WHEN I WAS
TRYING TO FIND MY LOOK.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.063
YOU SHOULD DRESS
LIKE THIS MORE OFTEN.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.533
- NO, I'VE FOUND MY LOOK NOW.
- AND THAT'S YOUR LOOK?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.667
YUP, THIS IS
THE WINNING LOOK.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.136
A MOSS-GREEN SHIRT
AND A TIE?

04:29.236 --> 04:31.238
OBVIOUSLY THIS
IS FOR WORK.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.341
UP HERE IS FOR PLAY,
ISN'T IT?

04:33.441 --> 04:35.643
NO, THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE STUFF.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.446
I REALLY ENJOYED IT.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
IT'S VERY POWERFUL.

04:38.546 --> 04:41.181
- OKAY?
IT TAKES HOLD OF YOU.
- KNOCK KNOCK.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.083
MORNING, PRIME MINISTER.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.885
GUYS, SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.420
THANK YOU, M'LORD.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.556
MURRAY, HAVE YOU
GOT AN ERASER?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.023
I'M DOING A DRAWING
BUT I'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.660
I'M WORKING ON A POSTER IDEA
FOR MY NEW CAMPAIGN.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.795
- THAT IS A GOOD POSTER, SIR.
- Prime Minister: NOT BAD.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.431
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT
NEW ZEALANDTOWN?

04:57.531 --> 04:59.567
- WHAT'S THAT?
- OH, I WAS GONNA
MENTION THAT.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.436
WELL, YOU KNOW CHINATOWN
AND LITTLE ITALY, RIGHT?

05:02.536 --> 05:05.005
- YEAH.
- WELL, WE WANT TO ESTABLISH
A NEW ZEALANDTOWN

05:05.105 --> 05:08.175
- RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.
- WHERE'S IT GONNA BE?

05:08.275 --> 05:11.545
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
ONE BLOCK BETWEEN CHINATOWN
AND LITTLE ITALY,

05:11.645 --> 05:13.481
WHICH ISN'T EXACTLY
ACCURATE GEOGRAPHICALLY,

05:13.581 --> 05:15.349
BUT IT'S PERFECT
FOR OUR NEEDS.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.950
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
GARY THE SHEEP.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.786
- HE'S FLYING OVER
FROM NEW ZEALAND.
- REALLY?

05:18.886 --> 05:20.821
YES, NEW ZEALAND'S
MOST FAMOUS SHEEP
IS GONNA BE THERE.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.090
- Murray: HE'S ON HIATUS.
- WE HAVE A CHAP SHEARING HI.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.459
- WELL, PRETENDING
TO SHEAR HIM.
- BE MIME SHEARING HIM.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.695
MIME SHEARING HIM
BECAUSE GARY'S GOT
HIS LOOK.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.631
WE CAN'T MESS WITH THAT.
AND WHILE I'M ON THAT,

05:30.731 --> 05:34.602
UM, WHAT WE NEED IS
A COOL BAND TO PLAY THERE.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.970
AND I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE
SOMETIMES INVOLVED IN MUSIC,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.540
- SO WHAT I WAS GONNA ASK--
- WOULD YOU LIKE US TO PLAY?

05:39.640 --> 05:42.309
- WELL, NO, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A COOL BAND.
- THEY ARE AVAILABLE.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.712
WE'RE CONSIDERED
QUITE COOL, AREN'T WE?

05:44.812 --> 05:47.014
- IN THEIR MINDS, YES.
- I SEE.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.282
- YEAH, YOU WANT
A COOLER BAND.
- NO, EXACTLY.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.486
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP,
WE DO NEED SOMEONE TO WORK
THE INFORMATION BOOTH.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.822
- YOU GUYS KEEN?
- Both: NO.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.356
GREAT.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.426
HEY, GREG, HAVE YOU
GOT AN ERASER?

05:58.526 --> 06:02.062

THE PRIME MINISTER IS
LOOKING FOR A COOL BAND.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.635
DON'T TOUCH IT.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.504
EW!

06:16.510 --> 06:17.911

YEAH, WE'RE A LITTLE
BIT COOLER NOW.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.882
YEAH, USUALLY YOU WEAR
CLOTHES FROM THE '70s.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.251
THEY'RE NOT FROM THE '70s.
THEY'RE FROM NEW ZEALAND.

ISN'T THAT THE SAME THING?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.022

10:09.977 --> 10:12.145
- YEAH.
- HELLO, I'M MURRAY.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.748
- PAULA, MURRAY.
- STOP SHAKING HER HAND.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.017
PAULA GREW UP NEXT TO ME.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.252
- 39 HARCOURT STREET, NELSON.
- YEAH.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.789
MIND YOU, THAT WAS ALL
A VERY VERY LONG TIME AGO.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.424
- MANY MANY YEARS AGO NOW.
- OH, YES, YEARS.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.626
A LOT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN.
THINGS CHANGE.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.962
- YEAH.
- PEOPLE GET MARRIED
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.031
YEAH.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.267
ANYWAY, MURRAY, PAULA'S
SECOND IN COMMAND AFTER ME

10:34.367 --> 10:35.568
AND THEN YOU
AND THEN GREG.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.204
OH.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.940
SO IF I WANTED TO, I COULD
TELL HER TO DO SOMETHING

10:40.040 --> 10:41.675
AND THEN SHE'D TELL
YOU TO DO IT.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.177
- BUT I COULD TELL GREG.
- THAT'S AT YOUR DISCRETION.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.613
LET'S JUST TEST OUT THIS
NEW SYSTEM, SHALL WE?

10:46.714 --> 10:48.916
PAULA, COULD YOU PLEASE ASK
MURRAY WHAT TIME IT IS?

10:49.016 --> 10:51.584
UM, HEY, MURRAY,
HAVE YOU GOT THE TIME?

10:51.685 --> 10:53.386
2:00.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.788
IT'S 2:00,
PRIME MINISTER.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.456
YES, I HEARD
AND I THINK HE HEARD ME.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.091
ON A BASIC LEVEL
THIS WORKS,

10:58.191 --> 10:59.993
BUT I THINK WE COULD USE
MORE DEVELOPMENT.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.930
ANYWAY, I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, GUYS.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.332
AND DID YOU ASK JEMAINE
ABOUT THAT THING?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.633
NOT YET.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.601
- SEE YOU GUYS.
- BYE, GUYS.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.838
WHAT THING?

11:10.938 --> 11:13.807
IT'S-- WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT SOON DURING
THE BAND MEETING.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.943
RIGHT, BAND MEETING.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.978
JEMAINE, PRESENT.
BRET?

11:18.078 --> 11:20.047
- YEAH, WHATEVER.
- OKAY, WHATEVER.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.982
MURRAY, PRESENT.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.617
NOW WITH
THE NEW ZEALANDTOWN,

11:24.718 --> 11:27.154
I'VE DECIDED WE SHOULD
REALLY LOOK AT OUR
CULTURAL HERITAGE.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.422
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE
A TRADITIONAL MAORI VILLAGE.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.459
YOU KNOW, GET A COUPLE
OF MAORIS STANDING THERE IN
THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.761
BUT THIS IS NEW YORK.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.863
YEAH, WELL, WE'LL GET
SOME BUSHES IN.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.365
WE'LL GET A LOG.
GET SOME WIND RUNNING
THROUGH IT.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.401
I THINK THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART IS TO
GET A MAORI WARRIOR.

11:41.501 --> 11:45.072
THAT WOULD REALLY SELL IT.
SO DO WE KNOW ANY MAORIS,
JEMAINE?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.474
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE PART
MAORI, AREN'T YOU?

11:47.574 --> 11:49.176
NO, I'M NOT DOING IT.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.279
- BUT YOU ARE PART MAORI?
- YES, BUT I'M NOT DOING IT.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.481
- PLEASE?
- NO.

11:54.581 --> 11:57.184
- PLEASE BE THE MAORI.
- NO.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.419
WELL, IF YOU DON'T DO IT
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET MEXICANS.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.888
YOU CAN'T GET
MEXICANS TO DO IT.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.522
THAT'S CULTURALLY
INSENSITIVE.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.425
WE'VE ALREADY SIGNED ONE UP
SO IT CAN'T BE TOO SENSITIVE.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.627
Prime Minister:
IS HE GONNA DO IT?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.898
NO, PRIME MINISTER,
HE'S NOT GONNA DO IT.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.500
SEE YOU LATER, GUYS.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.503
- WHATEVER.
- SEE YA, MURRAY.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.243
( groans )
GOOD MORNING, JEMAINE.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.112
YOUR HAIR DOESN'T
LOOK VERY COOL.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.713
WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME EARLIER?

12:26.814 --> 12:29.249
- OH, YOURS LOOKS BAD.
- DOES IT?

12:29.349 --> 12:32.252
- I NEED A BIT MORE GEL.
- PASS ME THE HAIR GEL.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.123
HEY, WHERE'S THE GEL GONE?

12:36.223 --> 12:37.925
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE GEL?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.327
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GEL?
IT WAS IN THERE.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.262
YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE GEL.
YOU USED IT.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.564
DID YOU FINISH THE GEL
ON YOUR BODY HAIR?

12:44.664 --> 12:46.834
N-- NO.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.802
YOU'VE BEEN
GELLING YOUR BEARD.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.138
YOUR BEARD LOOKS GOOD.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.640
- YOU USED MY HALF OF THE GEL.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:53.740 --> 12:56.043
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PUT IT DOWN.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.545
OH! THAT WAS
VERY DANGEROUS.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.948
- HOW DARE YOU
THROW THIS AT ME?
- DO NOT THROW THAT AT ME.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.650
I THINK IT'S A FITTING REVENGE
FOR YOU THROWING IT AT ME.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.285
OH!

13:05.385 --> 13:08.221
THAT WAS DANGEROUS.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.790
PAULA, HOW MANY TOOTHBRUSHES
HAVE WE GOT SO FAR

13:10.891 --> 13:12.525
FOR THE REPLICA OF
THE TOOTHBRUSH FENCE?

13:12.625 --> 13:16.029
46. BUT I KNOW
SOMEONE WHO'S BRINGING
IN ANOTHER TWO.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.465
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S STILL NOT 50

13:18.565 --> 13:21.801
AND WE NEED 50 REALLY
FOR AN EFFECTIVE REPLICA.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.338
CAN YOU TALK TO MURRAY
ABOUT ORGANIZING SOME MORE?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.573
MURRAY?

13:26.673 --> 13:28.976
UM, OKAY.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.412
HI, EVERYONE.
WE NEED MORE TOOTHBRUSHES.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.950
- Greg: I'll bring one in.
- THANKS, GREG.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.518
GOOD WORK, PAULA.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.253
THANK YOU.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.556
NOW, MURRAY,
THE ATTRACTIONS--
HOW ARE THEY COMING ALONG?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.193
WELL, I'VE BOOKED YOU
A TOUR BUS

13:46.293 --> 13:48.195
TO TAKE ALL THE PEOPLE
THROUGH NEW ZEALANDTOWN.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.031
GREAT. EXCELLENT.
CAN I DRIVE THE BUS?

13:51.131 --> 13:53.066
DON'T THINK THAT'S
A VERY GOOD IDEA.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.068
THE PRIME MINISTER OF
NEW ZEALAND DRIVING A BUS?

13:55.168 --> 13:56.870
PLEASE?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.806
PLEASE, MURRAY?

13:59.907 --> 14:02.042
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
- EXCELLENT.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.011
I GET TO DRIVE
THE TOUR BUS.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.879
WELL, GARY,
YOU MUST BE JET-LAGGED.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.547
LET'S GET YOU OFF TO
YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.950
DID YOU EVER THINK I'D END UP
BEING PRIME MINISTER, PAULA?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.219
NO. COMPLETE SURPRISE
TO ME.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.995
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
GET SOME MORE GEL.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.131
- WE CAN'T GO OUT THERE.
- WHY NOT?

14:24.231 --> 14:26.866
THERE'S PEOPLE.
THEY'LL SEE US.
NO ONE CAN SEE ME LIKE THIS.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.836
- YOU GO.
- NO, I CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.305
NOT WITHOUT GEL.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.641
WE'LL WAIT TILL
THERE'S NO ONE OUT THERE.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.352
( electronic music playing )

15:07.074 --> 15:09.209
- ( knocking )
- WHO IS IT?

15:09.309 --> 15:11.178
- WHO IS IT, BRET?
- WHO IS IT?!

15:11.278 --> 15:13.513
COME ON, COOL DUDES,
OPEN UP, IT'S ME.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.283
- Bret: YOU CAN'T COME IN.
- WHAT? AM I NOT COOL
ENOUGH FOR YOU NOW?

15:16.383 --> 15:18.785
- WE'VE RUN OUT OF GEL.
- WHAT?

15:18.885 --> 15:20.187
OPEN UP, COME ON.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.155
WE'VE RUN OUT OF GEL.
WE LOOK STUPID.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.790
I'M SURE YOU DON'T
LOOK THAT STUPID.
OPEN UP.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.159
( door unlocking )

15:26.259 --> 15:29.529
OH MY GOD!
OH, IT'S TERRIBLE.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.098
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

15:31.198 --> 15:32.732
WE'VE USED ALL
THAT GEL YOU GAVE US.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.368
- THE WHOLE BOTTLE?
- CAN YOU GET US
SOME MORE GEL?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.170
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT THINGS TO DO.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.838
I'VE GOT TO GO TO
THE QUARANTINE,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.507
PICK UP THE GRASS PATCH
FOR NEW ZEALANDTOWN.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.209
I'LL GET YOU SOME GEL ON
THE WAY BACK, ALL RIGHT?

15:42.309 --> 15:45.412
CLOSE THAT DOOR AND DON'T
LET ANYONE SEE YOU.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.049
THERE'S STILL SOME GEL.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.284
THERE'S STILL A LITTLE
BIT OF GEL.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.286
- YOU'RE IMAGINING THE GEL.
- THERE'S STILL SOME.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.355
THERE'S NO GEL LEFT.
IT'S NOT THERE.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.127
Jemaine:
WHERE IS HE?

16:00.227 --> 16:03.496
HE'S PROBABLY
JUST DROPPED THE GEL

16:03.596 --> 16:06.266
AND HE'S HAD TO GO BACK
AND GET SOME MORE.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.202
WHAT IF HE'S KEEPING
THE GEL FOR HIMSELF

16:09.302 --> 16:11.338
TO MAKE HIMSELF
LOOK GOOD?

16:15.008 --> 16:16.943
DON'T THINK SO, MAN.

16:17.044 --> 16:21.014
THAT BIG GINGER HEAD
OF HIS

16:21.114 --> 16:22.882
LOOKING GREAT.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.352
Prime Minister:
WELCOME, EVERYBODY.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.021
CHEERS.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.356
YOU'D BETTER HIDE
THAT BEER, SIR.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.990
YOU CAN'T DRINK
IN PUBLIC OVER HERE.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.859
WELL, WE'RE IN
NEW ZEALANDTOWN NOW.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.327
THERE'S NOTHING
THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.563
ACTUALLY, BRYAN, YOU CAN'T
DRINK AND DRIVE EITHER.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.267
OH, YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.
THANK YOU, PAULA.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.204
WELL, I'M BRYAN

16:44.304 --> 16:45.672
THE PRIME MINISTER
OF NEW ZEALAND

16:45.772 --> 16:48.275
AND, UM...

16:48.375 --> 16:51.811
I'M-- I'M SORRY, I'M JUST
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.446
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS
FOR A WHILE.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.416
- THE ATTRACTIONS.
- OH, MURRAY, THANK YOU.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.019
YES, WELL, WE'VE GOT
A FEW INTERESTING THINGS

17:00.120 --> 17:02.655
TO SHOW YOU ON OUR JOURNEY
TO NEW ZEALAND SO...

17:02.755 --> 17:05.658
LET'S GO.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.460
( bus starts )

17:14.334 --> 17:17.270
OH MY GOODNESS ME.
LOOK AT THAT.
QUIET, EVERYONE.

17:17.370 --> 17:21.508
IT'S SOME GENUINE NATIVE
MAORI WARRIORS.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.477
WE DON'T WANT TO
DISTURB THEM IN THEIR
NATURAL HABITAT.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.580
IF YOU'D LIKE TO
TAKE PICTURES, DO IT
VERY VERY QUIETLY.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.650
ALL RIGHT, IF EVERYONE'S
FINISHED TAKING PICTURES,

17:30.750 --> 17:33.353
LET'S MOVE ON.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.990
OKAY, EVERYBODY OFF.

17:38.091 --> 17:41.194
THAT WAS NEW ZEALANDTOWN.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.606
( sighs )

17:54.874 --> 17:56.943
OH.
( chuckles )

17:57.043 --> 17:59.779
THIS PLACE
IS REALLY A MESS.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.651
SOME MILK FOR MY PIGGIES.

18:09.989 --> 18:12.091
- Jemaine: MEL?
- ( shrieks )

18:12.192 --> 18:14.794
HEY, GUYS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:14.894 --> 18:17.530
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT
YOUR BAND MEETING FOR THE
NEW ZEALANDTOWN OPENING.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.098
DO YOU HAVE A KEY
TO OUR APARTMENT?

18:19.199 --> 18:22.034
THIS ISN'T MY PLACE,
IS IT?

18:22.135 --> 18:24.604
THIS IS YOUR PLACE.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.039
I MUST BE SLEEPWALKING.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.309
OH NO, DON'T WAKE ME.
YOU COULD KILL ME.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.779
DO YOU HAVE ANY GEL?

18:32.879 --> 18:34.314
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.283
I MIGHT HAVE
SOME MOUSSE MAYBE.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.285
- YEAH?
- OR SOME HAIRSPRAY.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.987
YEAH, JUST A LITTLE
MOUSSE WOULD BE GOOD.

18:41.087 --> 18:44.624
BIRD WATCHING.
I LOVE TO WATCH BIRDS.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.759
WHERE'S YOUR MOUSSE?
IS IT NOT IN HERE?

18:46.859 --> 18:48.127
MAYBE NOT
IN THIS POCKET.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.830
THIS IS MY SOCK.

18:50.930 --> 18:54.501
OH, WELL...
I GUESS I DON'T
HAVE ANY, GUYS.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.969
- YOU SAID YOU HAD SOME.
- I SAID I THOUGHT
I MIGHT HAVE SOME.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.573
YOU SAID YOU HAD MOUSSE.
JEMAINE, SHE SAID SHE
HAD MOUSSE.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.609
I'D BETTER GO
BEFORE I WAKE UP.

19:02.709 --> 19:06.346
YOU COME IN HERE
WITHOUT ANY MOUSSE?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.882
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.352
DO YOU HAVE ANY GEL, MEL?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.589
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
IN HERE.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.525
BRET.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.859
GLUE?

19:19.959 --> 19:23.830
- THIS SHOULD WORK.
- YEAH YEAH, THIS IS GOOD.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.665
IT'S JUST LIKE GEL.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.667
SAME VISCOSITY.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.704
( taps mike )

19:31.804 --> 19:33.005
WELCOME, EVERYONE.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.642
NOW NEW ZEALAND
HAS ALWAYS BEEN

19:35.742 --> 19:38.077
A LAND OF INNOVATORS.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.513
WE WERE THE FIRST COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD

19:40.613 --> 19:44.150
TO RESEARCH
AND DEVELOP THE CONCEPT
OF A SPREADABLE BUTTER

19:44.251 --> 19:46.786
THAT CAN BE USED STRAIGHT
FROM THE REFRIGERATOR.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.022
SO IT'S IN THAT GREAT
SPIRIT OF INNOVATION

19:50.122 --> 19:51.424
THAT WE ARE GATHERED
HERE TODAY

19:51.524 --> 19:54.361
TO CELEBRATE THE OPENING
OF NEW ZEALANDTOWN.

19:54.461 --> 19:57.964
LIKE CHINATOWN
OR LITTLE ETHIOPIA,

19:58.064 --> 20:01.200
AND ALSO SIMILAR
TO LITTLE ITALY.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.736
JEMAINE, I STUCK
MY HEAD TO MY HAND.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.639
- YOU IDIOT, BRET.
- YOU'VE GOT A PILLOW
ON YOUR HEAD.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.074
- WHAT? WHERE?
- OTHER SIDE.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.910
- OH, WE'RE BOTH IDIOTS.
- IDIOT, MAN.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.182
WHAT ARE YOU SITTING THERE
SO RELAXED FOR, BRET?

20:16.283 --> 20:17.984
AND GET THAT CUSHION OFF
YOUR HEAD, JEMAINE.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.820
WE HAD NO GEL
SO WE USED GLUE INSTEAD.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.955
Bret:
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
BRING US SOME GEL.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.457
SHIVERS,
I FORGOT YOUR GEL.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.993
LOOK, I'VE BEEN SO CAUGHT UP
WITH NEW ZEALANDTOWN.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.529
LOOK, I'LL SOLVE IT.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.464
HI, GREG, I NEED
SOME ANTI-GLUE.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.500
What's anti-glue,
Murray?

20:33.600 --> 20:36.068
WELL, IT'S
ANTI-GLUE, ISN'T IT?
IT GETS RID OF GLUE.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.271
I don't think
that exists, Murray.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.006
JUST GET IT, OKAY?
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.575
THANK YOU.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.544
NOW PLEASE,
CAN YOU GET READY?

20:44.644 --> 20:46.279
YOU DON'T NEED US.
YOU'VE GOT NEW ZEALAND'S
MOST FAMOUS SHEEP.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.147
WELL, THAT'S
THE WHOLE THING, JEMAINE.
I DON'T.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.882
HE'S BEEN SHORN OFF.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.118
THE GUY WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO MIME SHEAR HIM SHEARED
HIM FOR REAL.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.387
- HE'S BASICALLY BALD.
- GARY'S BALD?

20:54.487 --> 20:57.590
YES.
SO THERE'S YOUR STAR,
TIMID AND NERVOUS.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.427
AND TO MAKE MATTERS
WORSE, THE GUY NEXT
TO HIM BARBECUING--

21:00.527 --> 21:02.161
I THINK HE'S
BARBECUING LAMB.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.597
GARY CAN TELL.
HE'S LIVID.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.833
AND BY THE WAY, WHO'S MANNING
THE INFORMATION BOOTH?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.701
WHAT SIDE OF THE ROAD
DO YOU DRIVE ON?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.737
THE MIDDLE.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.306
WHAT LANGUAGE DO YOU
SPEAK THERE?

21:13.406 --> 21:15.708
WE PRETTY MUCH JUST MAKE IT
UP AS WE GO ALONG.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.209
REALLY?

21:17.310 --> 21:19.946
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
THE PEOPLE FROM THERE ARE
SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.383
Bret:
WE CAN'T DO IT.
WE'RE NOT COOL ENOUGH.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.117
GUYS, DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW A SECRET?

21:25.217 --> 21:28.655
IT WASN'T THE GEL
THAT MADE YOU COOL.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.857
IT WASN'T?

21:30.957 --> 21:34.727
IT WAS THE CONFIDENCE
THE GEL GAVE YOU.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.096
WHEN YOU STARTED TO FEEL
GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF

21:37.196 --> 21:39.499
EVERYONE ELSE
COULD FEEL THAT.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.101
AND THEY STARTED TO
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOU.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.971
REALLY?

21:45.071 --> 21:46.673
MAYBE.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.174
BRET,

21:48.274 --> 21:50.543
I THINK WE'VE GOT
A GIG TO PERFORM.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.046
- YEAH.
- GET US THE ANTI-GLUE.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.084
ALL RIGHT THEN.

21:58.184 --> 22:01.488
WHO LIKES TO
"ROCK THE PARTY"?

22:04.757 --> 22:08.595
NOW IT GIVES ME GREAT
PLEASURE AND PRIDE

22:08.695 --> 22:12.164
TO INTRODUCE TWO OF
THE COOLEST NEW ZEALANDERS
I HAVE EVER MET,

22:12.264 --> 22:15.334
OUR VERY OWN
FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS.

22:15.435 --> 22:19.372
( cheering )

22:21.207 --> 22:22.709
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.812
( playing )

22:36.255 --> 22:39.325
* I LIKE TO ROCK
THE PARTY *

22:39.426 --> 22:41.127
* PARTY GOING ON

22:41.227 --> 22:44.096
* AND IT LOOKS LIKE...

22:45.998 --> 22:48.968
YEAH, IT WAS
THE HAIR GEL, GUYS.
SORRY.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.137
- WE'RE NOT COOL?
- NO.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.673
THIS IS A NEW LOW,
ISN'T IT?

22:53.773 --> 22:54.841
YEAH.

22:54.941 --> 22:58.044
MURRAY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO NEW ZEALANDTOWN?

22:59.211 --> 23:00.913
THIS WAS
A COMPLETE DISASTER.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.483
WELL, I THOUGHT THAT WAS
RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.652
YES, IT WENT VERY WELL.
WELL DONE, PAULA.

23:05.752 --> 23:09.288
I THINK I'M GONNA HEAD BACK
TO MY HOTEL 'CAUSE I'VE GOT
TO FLY OUT IN THE MORNING.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.323
- OH, DO YOU?
- YEAH.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.125
OKAY.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.094
- Bret: NICE TO MEET YOU.
- BYE.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.129
YEAH.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.666
- PAULA.
- YES, BRYAN?

23:19.766 --> 23:22.401
UM, I...

23:24.904 --> 23:27.139
NOTHING.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.409
OKAY.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.381
( sighs )

23:35.482 --> 23:38.117
FORGET IT, BRYAN.
IT'S NEW ZEALANDTOWN.

23:40.453 --> 23:44.156
( man whistling )
