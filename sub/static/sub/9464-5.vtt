Of Mice and Men.

It's around the second bend

do last night?

01:20.750 --> 01:23.250
I watched the entire final

watch the final season?

What I'm saying is

01:38.917 --> 01:41.083
subbing is the best thing that
ever happened to me.

01:41.125 --> 01:44.417
-Oh, Ross was on a break.
Okay, that's a separate issue.

I don't have to mark. I don't
really have to talk to people.

I don't have to talk to parents.
It's unbelievable.

01:57.291 --> 02:01.000
-I'm hot just thinking about it.
-Anyway...

02:01.041 --> 02:04.375
I'm going to have a little
siesta. So keep it down, please.

02:04.417 --> 02:08.250
-Gerry, I need to talk you.
-Gosh, it's like I hear Lisa.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.208
Is she allowed in here?
[Gerry sighs]

02:11.250 --> 02:13.542
I was busy...
Ah, I was busy, Lisa.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.875
-Okay, Mr. Willoughby had
a nervous breakdown.

02:15.917 --> 02:18.333
-Yeah, I didn't have anything
to do with that, Lisa okay?

02:18.375 --> 02:22.291
-No Gerry, I need you to take
over his Phys Ed classes.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.166
-That's great news.
-It's JK through four.

02:25.208 --> 02:27.250
-No! Why did you add...?

02:27.291 --> 02:30.000
It's not Phys Ed, Lisa, When
you teach JK through four.

02:30.041 --> 02:34.000
Okay? That's games.
That's not a real...
I'm a real Phys Ed person.

02:34.041 --> 02:37.041
Do you have the authority to
take me out of subbing?

02:37.083 --> 02:42.208
Which I am loving. And put me
into a camp counsellor position.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.125
-I am your boss. Okay?

02:44.166 --> 02:46.458
Also, Ms. Lahey went
into labour.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.750
So, I need you take over her
grade nine math and senior
ethics.

02:49.792 --> 02:52.291
So congratulations, you're a
full time teacher again.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.583
-Ethnics? Is that what we're
doing now?

02:54.625 --> 02:58.458
Is that your new mandate?
To separate minorities?

02:58.500 --> 03:01.041
-Ethics! Gerry.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.250
-[Gerry]: That's a subject now?
Is that what we've come to?

03:03.291 --> 03:07.208
And you can learn all about it
when you mark these papers
that Ms. Lahey didn't get to.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.083
-That's unethnical.
-Take them Gerry.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.208

-Hey Cheeley. Nice sticks.
Shiney.

03:16.542 --> 03:18.875
-Oh, thanks.
-How much mileage you
got on those things?

03:18.917 --> 03:22.667
-Oh, not a lot. You know
my Bobbi tattoo?
-Yeah.

03:22.709 --> 03:25.291
-I'm getting it removed
and it got a little infected.

03:25.333 --> 03:29.417
-Ah, young love.
-Well, I don't see us getting
back together anytime soon.

03:29.458 --> 03:32.125
I might have jumped the
tattoo gun a bit, you know?

03:32.166 --> 03:35.041
-Oh man, tell me about it.
I've had that, here hold this.

03:35.083 --> 03:38.250
-[Robert]: Hmmm?
-I got this done when I was
teaching English in Thailand.

03:38.291 --> 03:42.583
-Frank.
-I proposed to a
Thai lady of the night.

03:42.625 --> 03:46.041
-Oh dear.
-Yeah, actually no, this one
I got for my mom's birthday.

03:46.083 --> 03:47.875
I got one on my back.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.792
Oh, sorry. Just...
-Okay, if you...

03:51.834 --> 03:53.792
Ahhhh. Huh.
-Yeah.

03:54.792 --> 03:57.291
Turns out, she didn't
really love me.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.166
And was a he.
-Can I give you a hand?

04:00.208 --> 04:02.166
-Oh no, I got this.

04:02.208 --> 04:05.875
-I have so much new found
respect for you guys, since
I've been on crutches.

04:05.917 --> 04:08.125
The world's not an easy place
for the physically disabled.

04:08.166 --> 04:13.208
-It's an even harder place for
the emotionally disabled,
my heartbroken friend.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.625
-You're right.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.041
-Hmm, whatever.
Hey, wait up.

doing?

-I wish I could say the same
for Timmy MacGregor.

04:38.917 --> 04:43.166
-Here we go.
-He has been hospitalized for
weeks, with a heart condition.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.875
-How bad is it?
-It's pretty bad.

04:45.917 --> 04:49.542
Yesterday, for example, he bit
into a carrot, he just passed
out.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.959
-How exactly did he just
pass out?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.917
-Mastication requires eight
different muscles. It was too
much exertion for him.

04:55.959 --> 04:58.083
-Well, that's just stupid.
Everybody knows that you

04:58.125 --> 05:02.125
shouldn't put long hard objects
in your mouth when you have
a heart condition.

05:02.166 --> 05:05.291

05:07.959 --> 05:10.083

-Okay.

05:10.125 --> 05:13.208
Um, so his parents have had
to take a leave of absence
from work.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.083
And the bills are just piling
up. It would be a real shame

05:16.125 --> 05:18.834
if they were forced to go back
to work, given the
circumstances.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.792
I'm trying to raise...

05:20.834 --> 05:24.875
Scratch that, I will raise
two thousand dollars!

-[Bobbi]: Look, we feel
awful for little Timmy.

05:27.250 --> 05:31.125
But we also felt awful for
your second cousin's
flooded basement.

05:31.166 --> 05:35.458
-Oh yeah.
-And your friend Susan's dog
who needed the leg operation.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.542
-I'm starting to feel sorry for
the Trudy Walsh foundation.

05:38.583 --> 05:43.208
-We just can't keep donating
to every person and every cause.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.792
-You're right. I have
overextended you.

05:45.834 --> 05:48.667
Timmy's parents were there
for his first words.

05:50.291 --> 05:53.375
They don't need to be there...
for his last.

05:53.417 --> 05:56.792

-Gimme a break will ya?

05:56.834 --> 05:58.750
How much?

05:58.792 --> 06:02.375
-I want you to give whatever is
meaningful to you.

teachers.

marking to do. So...

but truth is, I miss it.

-Well...
-Miss the students.
Miss my colleagues.

07:10.542 --> 07:13.959
-Oh, that's sweet.
-I think you missed your
medication.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.709
Haha. Do you miss the marking
too? The lesson plans?

07:17.750 --> 07:19.917
-Even that, if you can
believe it.

07:19.959 --> 07:23.333
-No I don't.
-I just love moulding
young minds.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.917
-Okay, so you taught
and you never once...

07:25.959 --> 07:29.875
Just stared at the clock over
and over and over again...

07:29.917 --> 07:33.542
Wondering when...
-Not once in all my teaching
years.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.166
-Even I mail it in the odd day.
So...

07:36.208 --> 07:38.709

07:38.750 --> 07:42.750

to meet you, enjoy your visit.

I still can't believe what
you said about this stuff.
