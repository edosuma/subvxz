WEBVTT

00:09.653 --> 00:12.963
Guess what I have in my hand.

00:13.173 --> 00:15.482
Do I have to call security?

00:16.053 --> 00:19.363
Before you have me tossed in the clink
you might wanna check it out.

00:19.533 --> 00:21.330
Uncle Phil's floor seats to the Lakers.

00:21.493 --> 00:23.563
So, what's up, I'll pick you up
like 6, 6: 15?

00:23.773 --> 00:28.528
Will, I appreciate you asking, especially
three hours before game time...

00:28.693 --> 00:31.161
...but I'm kind of dating
someone right now.

00:33.853 --> 00:35.684
You dating somebody right now?

00:35.853 --> 00:40.085
- Well, how come I'm the last to know?
- I have my reasons.

00:40.853 --> 00:44.402
Oh, I get it, I get it.
You're embarrassed.

00:44.573 --> 00:46.848
Dude is probably
some snaggletoothed...

00:47.013 --> 00:50.403
...pie-faced, snausage-lipped,
hunchback...

00:50.573 --> 00:54.452
- It's Hank Farley.
- Heisman Trophy winning fool.

00:54.653 --> 00:57.326
Tonight's Hank's 21 st birthday party.

00:57.573 --> 00:59.165
Hey, Jackie, hey, come on, girl...

00:59.373 --> 01:02.365
...now, you know that Hank Farley
is not your type.

01:02.573 --> 01:05.450
I'm saying, you strip away
the shoulder pads and the muscles...

01:05.653 --> 01:08.213
...and the dimples and what you got?
- You.

02:18.853 --> 02:20.889
Hey, hey, hey.

02:21.413 --> 02:23.085
Going to the Lakers game, huh, Will?

02:23.253 --> 02:27.166
Well, no, there's been a little change
of plans, Uncle Phil. I'm going to a party.

02:27.573 --> 02:29.723
Ask him if he got any sevens, Hil.

02:31.133 --> 02:33.169
Got any sevens, Daddy?

02:33.333 --> 02:36.166
Miss Ashley, ready for your big date?

02:36.333 --> 02:38.369
- Not really.
- What's the matter, honey?

02:38.933 --> 02:42.209
Did you ever have one of those days
when you just don't feel pretty?

02:42.373 --> 02:44.045
No.

02:45.893 --> 02:47.008
I don't know what to do.

02:47.173 --> 02:50.006
Robert's due here at 8
and I can't do anything with my hair...

02:50.173 --> 02:52.926
...nothing looks good on me
and I feel fat.

02:53.093 --> 02:54.845
Oh, Ashley, you look adorable.

02:55.013 --> 02:57.243
Oh, that's real comforting
coming from my father.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.131
- That's it, I'm not going.
- Ashley, wait.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.801
Look, your date won't be here
for another hour.

03:03.973 --> 03:07.204
Let's go upstairs and I'll give you
some Hilary Banks beauty tips.

03:07.413 --> 03:09.802
Trust me, I know exactly
what you're feeling.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.484
You mean, you've had nights
where you felt fat and ugly?

03:13.973 --> 03:16.328
Okay, so I don't know
exactly what you mean.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.841
You know, so when I was
at Notre Dame, right...

03:22.013 --> 03:25.369
...they put me in the last play
of the last game, right.

03:25.533 --> 03:27.842
Of course, when Hollywood
got a hold of my story...

03:28.013 --> 03:29.810
...they made it a white dude.

03:34.653 --> 03:36.564
Look, what are you
doing here anyway?

03:39.093 --> 03:40.731
Never mind.

03:40.933 --> 03:43.003
I think I'm gonna go have some chips.

03:43.173 --> 03:45.926
I'm gonna... I'm feeling chippy.

03:48.373 --> 03:49.806
Excuse me, excuse me.

03:49.973 --> 03:52.123
- Will.
- Hey, hey!

03:52.293 --> 03:57.242
Hey, Jackie! I didn't see you
standing in front of the dip.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.645
- Is this guy a friend of yours?
- Who wants to know?

04:07.973 --> 04:13.252
<i>Hank, Hank, Hank</i>

04:14.933 --> 04:16.651
And you are?

04:20.773 --> 04:22.968
<i>Where's Hank?</i>

04:26.573 --> 04:30.532
If that was a sorority out there
they would know what my name was.

04:30.693 --> 04:32.490
You know, my brother,
I was wondering...

04:32.653 --> 04:36.282
...was that the Ohio State game
where you fumbled three times?

04:36.453 --> 04:40.765
Yeah, well, I really shouldn't have tried
to play with a broken hand.

04:42.293 --> 04:45.410
Well, I played basketball once
without a leg.

04:45.613 --> 04:48.366
Then that explains
why your jokes are so lame.

04:48.733 --> 04:51.452
Hey, now, was that your call,
or did the coach send that in?

04:51.893 --> 04:55.602
Hey, the testosterone is starting
to reach a dangerous level.

04:55.773 --> 05:00.085
- Carlton, do you wanna dance?
- You wanna dance with me? Really?

05:00.293 --> 05:02.204
I thought there was
a chemistry between us.

05:02.373 --> 05:05.524
Ever since the day we met,
there was an indescribable something...

05:05.693 --> 05:07.251
Do you wanna dance?

05:21.213 --> 05:24.250
Daddy, I hope you're sitting down.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.408
Well, we all knew
that Ashley was, well, cute...

05:29.573 --> 05:33.043
...but with my help, she has turned
into an absolute knockout.

05:33.213 --> 05:36.285
So it gives me great pleasure
to present:

05:36.733 --> 05:39.566
The new Ashley Banks.

05:45.253 --> 05:49.644
Well, isn't she the most
gorgeous creature you've ever seen?

05:50.333 --> 05:52.244
Well, honey...

05:52.853 --> 05:54.969
...she looks like you.

05:55.173 --> 05:58.245
I know. Isn't it great?
I can't wait for Mom to see her.

05:58.413 --> 06:00.210
- When is she coming home?
- I'm not sure.

06:00.413 --> 06:03.007
She's bowling next door
at the Spellings.

06:05.093 --> 06:08.130
Ashley, sweetheart,
are you comfortable dressed like this?

06:08.293 --> 06:11.205
Well, Daddy, it all comes down
to what Robert thinks.

06:11.373 --> 06:15.002
Ashley, aren't we forgetting
something?

06:22.773 --> 06:24.126
I am so proud.

06:24.293 --> 06:27.729
Don't move, I need a picture of this.
I'll go get my camera.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.610
Well, Ashley, you look very nice.

06:35.813 --> 06:39.010
<i>Nice? I look like
Honey, I Shrunk the Hilary.</i>

06:39.213 --> 06:42.330
If you don't like what Hilary
did to you, why don't you tell her so?

06:42.493 --> 06:46.042
I can't. It would hurt her feelings.
There's only one thing I can do.

06:47.093 --> 06:50.005
Hello, Robert? Listen, I can't go.

06:50.173 --> 06:52.687
I got stuck babysitting
my little brother.

06:52.853 --> 06:54.366
Yeah, me too.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.524
Well, bye.

06:57.213 --> 06:59.886
Okay. Say, "Charge it."

07:01.973 --> 07:04.771
Hilary, Robert canceled on me.

07:04.933 --> 07:06.969
And after all your hard work.

07:07.173 --> 07:10.404
Oh, that's awful.
But look on the bright side.

07:10.573 --> 07:14.646
You might have gotten dumped,
but you look marvelous.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.528
Ashley, where did you learn
to lie like that?

07:21.733 --> 07:22.802
Mom taught me.

07:40.453 --> 07:44.446
Poor Jackie, man.
Stuck over there with that clown.

07:44.613 --> 07:46.251
She got to be miserable.

07:47.293 --> 07:49.568
Go, Hank, yeah!

07:50.813 --> 07:54.772
What would it take for me
to get a woman to make that noise?

07:55.573 --> 07:57.609
Probably cash.

07:59.573 --> 08:03.566
Hey, you know what, I can't stand
to see her suffer like this.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.327
Oh, excuse me, excuse me,
Montana, Montana.

08:06.493 --> 08:09.485
Let me show you how
we do this in a hip city.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.930
- What's up, man?
- What's up with you?

08:15.133 --> 08:18.125
Hank, let me just dance
with him this one time, all right?

08:19.213 --> 08:20.441
Whatever you say, baby.

08:22.253 --> 08:24.562
Hey, why don't you go
take a steroid break?

08:27.573 --> 08:30.451
Girl, I'm sure glad
we got rid of that nut.

08:35.493 --> 08:38.929
You pretty good with your legs,
but let's see how you are with your arm.

08:39.133 --> 08:40.645
What?

08:43.573 --> 08:47.248
Arm wrestling? That's a boy's game.

08:47.813 --> 08:49.451
You're right.

08:49.893 --> 08:52.646
Step up to a man's game. Matt.

08:55.013 --> 08:58.130
Look, if this is over me, you can
just stop it right now, all right?

08:58.333 --> 09:02.042
This is bigger than you, baby.
It's a man thing.

09:03.653 --> 09:05.450
Excuse me.

09:08.893 --> 09:11.771
All right, lightweight, bottom's up.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.924
Freeze!

09:18.533 --> 09:20.603
Will, what the heck
do you think you're doing?

09:20.773 --> 09:22.411
- You can't drink.
- Why not?

09:22.573 --> 09:26.486
Because you're underage.
It's against the law, mister.

09:29.413 --> 09:32.689
Thank you very much,
McGruff, the Crime Dog...

09:32.853 --> 09:34.809
...but this is the law of the jungle.

09:35.013 --> 09:38.005
It's chump or be chumped.
I know what I'm doing.

09:39.573 --> 09:43.043
A toast to my worthy opponent.

09:43.653 --> 09:46.884
In the words of Public Enemy,
"Bring the noise."

10:07.093 --> 10:09.049
Smooth.

10:22.653 --> 10:24.166
All right.

10:27.573 --> 10:30.007
Stop it. This has gotten
way out of hand.

10:30.613 --> 10:32.410
What are you talking about, man?

10:32.573 --> 10:34.609
I only had...

10:36.493 --> 10:37.972
...two.

10:38.453 --> 10:41.013
Look, you've had enough.
Come on, get up.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.524
There, you happy?

10:45.533 --> 10:46.761
Will.

10:46.933 --> 10:49.447
Hey, look, look, listen, man, listen.

10:49.613 --> 10:52.332
I'm not stopping until he does.

11:08.133 --> 11:10.328
Bring it on, Sasquatch.

11:11.013 --> 11:13.527
Look, I've had about all
I can take of this damn thing.

11:13.693 --> 11:16.161
Carlton, would you
take me home, please?

11:17.813 --> 11:19.246
Jackie.

11:20.773 --> 11:25.005
Yeah, Carlton, have the valet
bring around your big wheel.

11:26.573 --> 11:28.450
I'm ashamed of you.

11:28.613 --> 11:31.571
Look, I'm gonna go take Jackie home.
Wait here until I get back.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.805
And you're in no condition
to drive, mister.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.964
As a matter of fact,
give me your keys.

11:37.133 --> 11:41.649
Hey, hey, what you talking about, man?
I can keep my own car keys.

11:41.813 --> 11:43.804
You understand? I'm responsible.

11:43.973 --> 11:45.964
I had a puppy.

11:46.453 --> 11:47.727
What happened to him?

11:48.893 --> 11:52.329
- I don't know.
- Give me those keys.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.964
That ain't it.

11:56.733 --> 11:59.486
Just wait here, I'll be back for you.

12:00.733 --> 12:04.203
I hope you're gonna have fun
driving my gym locker.

12:04.733 --> 12:07.247
You happy, chump? Jackie left.

12:07.413 --> 12:09.847
Oh, man, that's really...
That's a shame.

12:10.013 --> 12:15.724
That's a shame because she's going
to miss my tribute to you.

12:15.893 --> 12:17.485
Excuse me.

12:18.013 --> 12:20.208
Ladies and gentlemen...

12:20.653 --> 12:25.647
...I'd like to make a roast
to Mr. Stank Barley.

12:26.653 --> 12:31.124
Now, listen, listen.
This man is an all-American...

12:31.333 --> 12:34.928
...which don't really matter
because we all Americans.

12:35.613 --> 12:39.606
No, but seriously,
Spanky here got some moves.

12:39.773 --> 12:43.971
But, he ain't getting no parts
of the scoreboard with my girl Jackie...

12:44.133 --> 12:49.332
...because she can see through
a chump like you a mile away.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.725
Both of you.

12:53.733 --> 12:59.126
Jock itching, wide receiving,
love-to-take-the-snap punk.

13:00.373 --> 13:02.603
Happy Kwanzaa, Crank.

13:06.533 --> 13:09.525
Look at that. I think he's dead.

13:09.733 --> 13:12.042
And you know where dead people go.

13:14.133 --> 13:15.532
Hey, kid, get up.

13:17.093 --> 13:18.572
What's that, Jackie?

13:18.733 --> 13:21.611
You've got an even
smaller bathing suit?

13:21.813 --> 13:25.089
All right, Sleepy, let's go.
Naptime's over.

13:26.613 --> 13:30.083
Oh, man, I feel like death.

13:30.493 --> 13:33.326
Well, you came to the right place.

13:41.693 --> 13:43.490
What the...

13:46.893 --> 13:50.806
- Are you the caretaker here?
- No, I'm more like a tenant.

13:50.973 --> 13:54.045
Hey, you play poker?
We need a fourth.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.689
A fourth? There's only two of us.

14:01.693 --> 14:03.843
Now there's four.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.366
Make it three.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.810
Y'all are dead, aren't you?

14:20.973 --> 14:22.804
"Dead" is so politically incorrect.

14:22.973 --> 14:26.409
We prefer the term, "living impaired."

14:26.973 --> 14:29.282
- That's much nicer.
- I can live with that.

14:29.733 --> 14:31.610
Am I dead?

14:31.773 --> 14:33.923
Well, there's only one way
to find out:

14:34.093 --> 14:35.606
Take the wall test.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.047
The living guys always fall for that.

14:50.213 --> 14:52.283
Come on, sit down.

14:56.253 --> 14:59.165
- Smoke?
- No, no, I don't smoke.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.925
Hey, you shouldn't either, man.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.611
I just gave a health tip to a dead guy.

15:06.533 --> 15:08.524
<i>Somebody's been hitting the vino.</i>

15:08.933 --> 15:14.132
Oh, it's tequila. I mean, I was just going
shot-for-shot with this football clown.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.370
Oh, drinking contests
are Nowheresville.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.922
You wanna prove you're a real man,
you play chicken.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.769
Now, two guys drive towards a cliff.

15:22.933 --> 15:25.367
The first one that stops, loses.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.969
That's how I got here. I won.

15:30.453 --> 15:32.125
I'm sorry, let's review here:

15:32.333 --> 15:35.086
You went flying off a cliff.

15:35.293 --> 15:38.763
The guy who didn't is probably laying up
under your woman right now...

15:38.933 --> 15:43.723
...and you're stuck here
playing eternal poker with no chips.

15:43.933 --> 15:44.922
Nice going, buddy.

15:45.893 --> 15:48.407
Hey, they called me yellow.

15:48.613 --> 15:51.047
Oh, please, Rebel-Without-A-Clue...

15:51.253 --> 15:54.529
...it's kids like you who make me glad
I never had children.

15:54.693 --> 15:55.808
So you were married?

15:56.253 --> 16:00.485
Yes, but I was so focused on my career
that my husband left me.

16:00.653 --> 16:01.881
I think.

16:02.053 --> 16:04.851
I actually never did have time
to read that note.

16:05.453 --> 16:07.011
So, what did you do?

16:07.173 --> 16:10.882
I was in publishing,
worked with a number one author.

16:11.053 --> 16:16.252
Very competitive, but I pushed
and pushed until I made it to the top.

16:18.013 --> 16:20.368
I liked being on top.

16:20.533 --> 16:21.966
I was a real winner.

16:22.133 --> 16:25.887
Is winning really worth
going to an early grave?

16:26.093 --> 16:29.324
You bet it is.
Yeah, I always wanted to be the best.

16:29.493 --> 16:31.643
You know, I never even sat down
between rounds.

16:31.813 --> 16:34.566
Yeah, I couldn't wait
to get back in there and slug it out.

16:35.613 --> 16:37.331
Let me guess. You died in the ring?

16:37.493 --> 16:40.291
No, during the post-fight interview.

16:40.453 --> 16:43.570
The doctor said
the next punch could kill me.

16:43.733 --> 16:45.325
A lucky guess.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.249
You know, if you guys
don't mind me saying...

16:48.413 --> 16:50.449
...you all died for some
really dumb reasons.

16:50.613 --> 16:52.490
Now, that's where you're wrong.

16:52.653 --> 16:56.532
We may have paid the ultimate price,
but at least we had everyone's respect.

16:56.733 --> 16:59.964
Yes, their last respects.

17:01.573 --> 17:03.723
Oh, not again.

17:04.413 --> 17:07.246
Yo, Billy, go back to your plot.

17:07.413 --> 17:10.051
That damn kid won't stay buried.

17:10.252 --> 17:12.686
I don't have the patience
to deal with him.

17:12.853 --> 17:14.763
Would you mind?

17:15.532 --> 17:19.571
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

17:26.653 --> 17:29.406
- Hey, Billy?
- Who wants to know?

17:29.573 --> 17:32.326
- Oh, my name is Will Smith.
- Can you catch?

17:32.533 --> 17:35.093
Oh, yeah, come on, throw it.
Let's see what you've got.

17:35.253 --> 17:38.131
Oh, some arm
you got there, kid.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.530
I know, I was gonna
play shortstop for the Dodgers.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.371
Hey, maybe you still will one day.

17:53.813 --> 17:55.371
Billy...

17:56.373 --> 17:58.125
...how did you die?

18:00.093 --> 18:02.482
I was playing ball on the sidewalk.

18:02.693 --> 18:06.891
This car jumped the curb,
took me out.

18:07.093 --> 18:09.163
The driver was drunk.

18:14.853 --> 18:16.844
Come on, let's play.

18:18.413 --> 18:22.326
No, I'm not feeling so good, Billy.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.485
I'm gonna just chill for a minute.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.732
Will.

18:42.893 --> 18:44.326
Will.

18:45.693 --> 18:47.206
Will.

18:48.093 --> 18:49.685
Will.

18:51.653 --> 18:55.612
Hey, Uncle Phil.

18:57.893 --> 19:01.522
Hey, hey.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.244
You're little.

19:11.533 --> 19:14.491
Don't worry, Ash,
there are plenty of men in the sea.

19:14.693 --> 19:16.604
You mean fish in the sea.

19:16.813 --> 19:19.805
No, I mean men,
fish don't own yachts.

19:21.173 --> 19:23.607
Look, Ashley, Robert was a jerk
for standing you up...

19:23.773 --> 19:25.809
...but he's gonna be sorry he ever did.

19:25.973 --> 19:27.247
Why do you say that?

19:27.453 --> 19:30.809
Because starting tomorrow, not only
am I gonna do your hair and makeup...

19:31.013 --> 19:34.164
...but I'm getting you a manicure,
pedicure and a mud bath.

19:34.333 --> 19:36.847
People are gonna think we're twins.

19:37.373 --> 19:40.729
Hilary, Robert didn't stand me up.

19:40.893 --> 19:43.453
- I canceled our date.
- Why?

19:44.293 --> 19:46.761
Look, I appreciate you trying
to do all this for me...

19:46.933 --> 19:48.810
...but it just isn't me.

19:48.973 --> 19:52.443
I mean, I didn't feel comfortable
having Robert see me like that.

19:52.613 --> 19:53.887
I hope you're not mad.

19:54.813 --> 19:57.611
Ashley, you're my baby sister.

19:57.773 --> 19:59.206
I love you.

19:59.373 --> 20:03.082
There's certainly nothing wrong with you
wanting to look just the way you are...

20:03.253 --> 20:05.289
...you're just not gonna do
the volume I do.

20:07.453 --> 20:09.569
Miss Ashley, a young man to see you.

20:09.773 --> 20:13.686
- Robert. Oh, my God, I look terrible.
- Stop.

20:15.893 --> 20:17.804
I thought I could help you babysit.

20:18.013 --> 20:19.526
This is embarrassing.

20:20.773 --> 20:22.684
I'm not really babysitting.

20:22.893 --> 20:25.327
You're not?
Then why did you tell me that you...

20:25.533 --> 20:27.251
Look, it's a long story.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.806
Tell me about it
over some frozen yogurt.

20:31.693 --> 20:33.365
Really?

20:35.453 --> 20:37.205
Let's go.

20:40.533 --> 20:44.606
Well, Miss Hilary, I guess
beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

20:44.773 --> 20:46.604
Yeah, right.

20:53.973 --> 20:57.761
Man, how could I make
such a mess of this stuff?

20:57.933 --> 20:59.571
Well, not rolling down the window...

20:59.733 --> 21:02.327
...before you ralphed
in the Volvo was a good start.

21:02.813 --> 21:05.691
Look, why would you even bother
competing with a guy like that?

21:05.853 --> 21:08.572
That dude was trying to play me.
What was I supposed to do?

21:08.733 --> 21:09.961
You could have walked away.

21:10.973 --> 21:12.850
That... I know... The...

21:13.013 --> 21:17.529
You know, it's like I was
watching myself being stupid...

21:17.693 --> 21:20.127
...but I couldn't do nothing about it.

21:20.933 --> 21:23.686
That must be
what Chevy Chase felt like.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.891
I can relate.

21:28.053 --> 21:31.045
Remember last Christmas when I had
that second slice of rum cake?

21:31.213 --> 21:33.727
The next thing I knew,
I was up on the kitchen table...

21:33.893 --> 21:36.248
...with a lampshade on my head
singing show tunes.

21:37.093 --> 21:40.130
Trust me, I learned my lesson, man.
I ain't never drinking again.

21:40.293 --> 21:43.968
Come on, I mean, it's a matter of being
responsible and knowing your limits.

21:46.093 --> 21:49.210
You know, I almost got in my car
and drove home tonight.

21:50.293 --> 21:52.090
Well, let's just be glad you didn't.

21:52.493 --> 21:54.927
Well, I got a lot
accomplished today, huh?

21:55.093 --> 22:00.008
I lost Jackie, I lost my self-respect,
lost my dinner.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.893
I ain't got nothing left.

22:06.653 --> 22:08.609
Wrong again.

22:20.653 --> 22:25.522
I'm sorry, guys, but I really
don't remember my next line.

22:29.493 --> 22:31.563
No, I really don't.

22:32.613 --> 22:35.491
- Is waiting worth the...
- Okay, we can just keep going.

22:35.653 --> 22:38.645
We can keep going.
We can keep going. All right. What?
