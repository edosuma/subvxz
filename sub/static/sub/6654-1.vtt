00:41.929 --> 00:43.652
Basic principles:

00:43.752 --> 00:45.727
No woman wakes up saying:

00:45.992 --> 00:48.862
"God, I hope I don't get
swept off my feet today."

00:51.721 --> 00:56.031
Now, she might say,
"This is a really bad time for me."

00:58.216 --> 01:02.242
Or something like, "I just need some space."

01:03.688 --> 01:06.241
Or my personal favorite:

01:06.376 --> 01:08.962
"I'm really into my career right now."

01:11.976 --> 01:14.398
You believe that? Neither does she.

01:14.568 --> 01:18.278
You know why?
Because she's lying to you, that's why.

01:18.952 --> 01:21.407
You understand me? Lying.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.794
It's not a bad time for her.
She doesn't need any space.

01:25.928 --> 01:27.717
She may be into her career...

01:27.848 --> 01:31.361
but what she's really saying is,
"Get away from me now."

01:31.751 --> 01:34.206
Or possibly, "Try harder, stupid."

01:37.128 --> 01:38.818
Well, which one is it?

01:38.920 --> 01:42.979
60% of all human communication
is nonverbal.

01:43.335 --> 01:44.764
Body language.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.814
30% is your tone.

01:47.367 --> 01:50.880
So that means that
90% of what you're saying...

01:51.111 --> 01:53.380
ain't coming out of your mouth.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.280
Toby!

01:58.791 --> 01:59.806
Shit!

01:59.911 --> 02:01.155
Of course she'll lie to you.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.938
She's a nice person,
she doesn't wanna hurt your feelings.

02:04.039 --> 02:06.559
What else is she gonna say?
She doesn't even know you.

02:06.695 --> 02:07.710
Yet.

02:10.439 --> 02:13.156
Luckily, the fact is
that just like the rest of us...

02:13.287 --> 02:17.477
even a beautiful woman doesn't know
what she wants until she sees it.

02:17.735 --> 02:19.328
And that's where I come in.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.536
My job is to open her eyes.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.221
Oh, my God!

02:29.319 --> 02:31.228
Is this what you're looking for?

02:31.367 --> 02:35.077
Basic principles: No matter what,
no matter when, no matter who...

02:35.207 --> 02:38.556
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.674
Just needs the right broom.

02:49.766 --> 02:51.937
You cannot use what you do not have.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.908
So if you're shy, be shy.
If you're outgoing, be outgoing.

02:55.047 --> 02:57.381
- I'm not outgoing.
- That's okay.

02:57.479 --> 03:00.795
She may not want the whole truth,
but she does want the real you.

03:00.934 --> 03:04.163
She may not want to see it all at once,
but she does want to see it.

03:04.295 --> 03:08.899
So tonight, when you're wondering what
to say, how you look, or if she likes you...

03:08.999 --> 03:11.846
just remember, she is already out with you.

03:12.166 --> 03:16.160
That means she said yes
when she could have said no.

03:16.358 --> 03:20.133
That means she made a plan
when she could have just blown you off.

03:20.262 --> 03:24.157
So that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you.

03:24.294 --> 03:27.109
It is your job not to mess it up.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.733
The shoes are hot.
You went to the place I told you?

03:32.838 --> 03:37.180
Yeah, but I don't think they're really me.

03:37.638 --> 03:40.867
"You" is a very fluid concept right now.

03:40.966 --> 03:44.381
You bought the shoes.
You look great in the shoes.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.209
That's the you I'm talking about.

03:48.933 --> 03:51.584
The key tonight is hang back.

03:52.581 --> 03:54.524
Give her plenty of space.

03:55.174 --> 03:58.043
If she lingers at a photograph, move on.

03:59.941 --> 04:01.850
But maintain the visual.

04:05.605 --> 04:10.209
It's supposed to be 64 and clear tonight.
So when you leave the club, walk a little.

04:10.342 --> 04:12.546
Ask her what she thought about the show...

04:12.645 --> 04:15.263
what was her favorite photograph,
why that one.

04:15.365 --> 04:18.627
And when she answers,
don't be looking at her mouth.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.278
Don't be wondering
what she looks like naked.

04:21.413 --> 04:24.729
Listen to what she is saying and respond.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.514
Listen and respond.

04:28.165 --> 04:29.889
That way, when it's your turn to talk...

04:30.021 --> 04:32.803
you'll have something better to say than,
"I like your mouth."

04:32.933 --> 04:35.104
What was your favorite one?

04:35.877 --> 04:37.884
The elephant, definitely.

04:38.021 --> 04:40.574
And all of a sudden,
we're on date number two.

04:44.261 --> 04:45.373
Ready.

04:51.141 --> 04:52.286
No way.

04:53.925 --> 04:56.859
We're going back in there.
You have to smile.

04:57.157 --> 05:00.604
In case you didn't go to high school,
hitting is a good thing.

05:00.740 --> 05:03.162
So how does it happen, great love?

05:03.300 --> 05:04.282
Are you okay?

05:04.420 --> 05:05.981
- Nobody knows.
- I'm good.

05:06.084 --> 05:09.281
Let me get a Bomb Pop
and a Screwball for the lady.

05:09.412 --> 05:13.503
But what I can tell you,
is that it happens in the blink of an eye.

05:15.780 --> 05:18.169
One moment, you're enjoying your life.

05:18.340 --> 05:22.301
And the next, you're wondering
how you ever lived without them.

05:23.492 --> 05:25.500
Three dates is all I need.

05:26.085 --> 05:29.881
Three dates, and I'll get you here,
to the high-stakes medal round...

05:30.020 --> 05:32.890
where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss...

05:32.996 --> 05:36.706
will tell them everything they need to know
about the relationship.

06:04.995 --> 06:07.297
After that, you're on your own.

06:07.939 --> 06:09.728
But always remember...

06:10.051 --> 06:12.921
life is not the amount of breaths you take.

06:14.532 --> 06:17.434
It's the moments that take your breath away.

06:21.604 --> 06:23.840
Did I call it or did I call it?

06:24.036 --> 06:26.043
I mean, what did I say, six months?

06:26.179 --> 06:27.837
And when was her first date?

06:27.972 --> 06:30.841
So five-and-a-half?
God, I hate it when I'm right.

06:30.979 --> 06:34.459
What is it about guys that makes them
want to screw anything that walks...

06:34.563 --> 06:37.759
even when they're going out with
someone as awesome as Allegra Cole?

06:37.891 --> 06:40.542
She's only the most fabulous thing
walking around New York.

06:40.643 --> 06:41.658
Thanks, Young.

06:41.763 --> 06:43.967
Are you kidding?
Of course I'm gonna run it.

06:44.131 --> 06:47.360
Why should she waste her heart
on some Swedish aristo-brat?

06:47.491 --> 06:49.378
Even if he is gorgeous.

06:49.731 --> 06:51.138
If he's stupid enough to cheat...

06:51.235 --> 06:53.569
the world should know
he's dumb enough to get caught.

06:53.698 --> 06:56.000
Exactly. I'm in the elevator.
See you in a minute.

06:56.130 --> 06:58.170
Good morning, how are you?

06:58.498 --> 07:00.254
Bitter, party of one.

07:01.571 --> 07:02.781
You should try it sometime.

07:02.883 --> 07:06.014
Barbados by myself?
I wouldn't last five minutes.

07:06.115 --> 07:07.838
It was just what the doctor ordered.

07:07.971 --> 07:11.287
I slept in, I did my yoga,
I read a couple of books...

07:11.394 --> 07:13.020
flirted with my scuba instructor.

07:13.123 --> 07:16.090
- And apparently never left the office.
- I know, isn't that great?

07:16.194 --> 07:18.234
You should've taken someone with you.

07:18.370 --> 07:20.410
Who am I gonna take with me?

07:20.515 --> 07:22.686
This is where a boyfriend comes in handy.

07:22.818 --> 07:27.096
- I don't have time for a boyfriend.
- You said that two years ago.

07:27.202 --> 07:30.049
Yes, and it's as true today as it was then.

07:30.434 --> 07:31.994
I thought you were on vacation.

07:32.130 --> 07:35.327
See if these are in focus
and have them in my desk in an hour.

07:35.458 --> 07:39.648
Besides, relationships are for people
waiting for something better to come along.

07:39.778 --> 07:41.982
Spoken like a true cynic.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.127
I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist.

07:44.258 --> 07:48.536
You are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.162
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

07:51.298 --> 07:52.759
She works here, remember?

07:52.898 --> 07:55.418
No, she doesn't. Not for another four days.

07:55.522 --> 07:57.245
- This couldn't wait.
- It could.

07:57.378 --> 07:59.166
What are you doing? Go back to the beach.

07:59.298 --> 08:02.015
- I don't want you here.
- No, really, you do.

08:02.146 --> 08:05.015
You are becoming
a sick, workaholic lunatic...

08:05.122 --> 08:06.747
and this is exactly...

08:06.850 --> 08:10.843
the kind of nervous, overwrought behavior
that leads to...

08:10.978 --> 08:13.695
Pictures of Sebby with a busty brunette.

08:13.985 --> 08:16.603
A very big raise.

08:16.802 --> 08:20.063
Jesus. You could find dirt in a snowstorm.

08:20.642 --> 08:22.016
Comes with the job.

08:22.146 --> 08:26.618
You know, kiddo, there is more to life
than watching other people live it.

08:27.169 --> 08:29.405
Can I help he was cheating on my beach?

08:29.538 --> 08:31.959
I think it's great
that you're so good at your job.

08:32.097 --> 08:34.618
I'm just a little worried as to why.

08:36.001 --> 08:37.943
Let me worry about that.

08:38.304 --> 08:41.174
Okay. I want that column on my desk
by lunch.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.590
So you'll pay for my hotel?

08:42.688 --> 08:45.984
For you to sip mai tais?
I don't think so. Get out.

08:57.985 --> 08:59.327
- Come on.
- What?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.831
- That's good, right?
- No.

09:00.929 --> 09:02.455
No, it was in and it freaked out.

09:02.561 --> 09:06.423
You know what your problem is, Hitch?
You're all about the short game.

09:07.969 --> 09:11.133
You pick your shots
based on what you see first...

09:11.521 --> 09:14.652
not what's necessarily best for you...

09:15.776 --> 09:17.337
in the long run.

09:18.081 --> 09:22.271
All of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby.

09:22.369 --> 09:25.784
You know, I'm very happy for you.
Just not meant for everybody.

09:25.888 --> 09:28.703
So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty...

09:28.801 --> 09:31.899
totally varied, wildly experimental
short game.

09:32.768 --> 09:35.932
- I was talking about pool, but whatever.
- Yeah, okay.

09:36.064 --> 09:38.683
Honestly, I just hope one day
you're able to experience...

09:38.816 --> 09:42.361
the unconditional love, trust,
and openness...

09:42.497 --> 09:44.285
that I share with Grace every single day.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.897
- Is this really barroom talk?
- You need to listen to me. I'm serious.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.586
Because when you get to a place
with a woman like that...

09:50.688 --> 09:52.444
it's so beyond anything physical that...

09:52.576 --> 09:55.129
when I think back to
when I used to run around with you...

09:55.264 --> 09:58.111
and chase all these really gorgeous
but shallow women...

09:58.240 --> 10:02.975
I don't know, it's kind of ridiculous
and vaguely pathetic.

10:09.824 --> 10:12.726
Yeah, I see what you mean. That's pathetic.

10:17.023 --> 10:18.333
So, how'd you meet him?

10:18.464 --> 10:21.246
I was in La Perla
just buying some weekend thongs.

10:21.376 --> 10:23.797
- And he was doing likewise?
- No.

10:24.255 --> 10:27.070
Actually, he said he was buying something
for his mom.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.411
His mom?

10:28.703 --> 10:31.256
Casey, who buys high-priced lingerie
for their mother?

10:31.360 --> 10:33.564
Well, maybe he was looking for a robe.

10:33.887 --> 10:38.043
Casey, he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.520
- I prefer the mother story.
- I know you do, but that's not the point.

10:42.655 --> 10:45.787
No, the point is I'm not gonna start out
assuming the guy's a liar.

10:45.887 --> 10:48.408
- Why not?
- Because that's how you wind up...

10:49.663 --> 10:51.605
Like me? Is that what you were gonna say?

10:51.743 --> 10:54.110
No. I was gonna say, "Like you."

10:54.495 --> 10:56.350
- What's his name?
- Why?

10:56.767 --> 10:59.102
- I'm gonna Google him.
- No. Google your own guy.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.087
Let's just see if his mother's still alive.

11:01.215 --> 11:04.030
- So when is Grace due again?
- Soon.

11:04.447 --> 11:06.902
- You excited?
- What'd you say?

11:07.199 --> 11:09.686
Do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here?

11:09.823 --> 11:10.935
No, don't do that.

11:11.039 --> 11:14.901
Are you saying you don't wanna talk to them
because you can't go home with them?

11:15.007 --> 11:17.146
I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

11:17.246 --> 11:19.865
- Have you heard of the Date Doctor?
- Urban myth.

11:19.966 --> 11:21.177
- Really?
- Absolutely.

11:21.279 --> 11:22.840
I was hoping he also helped women.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.877
Casey, you're not sick. You're single.

11:26.142 --> 11:28.379
You just have to relax and enjoy the ride.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.617
I haven't been ridden in months.

11:33.566 --> 11:38.323
On that happy note, I'm gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight.

11:38.462 --> 11:40.567
- You mean, besides me.
- Right.

11:41.183 --> 11:42.131
Bye.

11:42.239 --> 11:44.540
I'll go get those girls,
bring them over here...

11:44.638 --> 11:46.777
and we'll have a conversation
like human beings.

11:46.878 --> 11:50.457
Then you're gonna home,
and I'll take them back to my apartment.

11:50.558 --> 11:54.836
Well, that sounds like fun for me.
But you might want to get in line, pal.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.724
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, how are you?

11:59.423 --> 12:03.449
Hey, baby, can I get a couple Coronas
at the pool table, please? Thanks.

12:03.582 --> 12:04.891
Excuse me.

12:07.454 --> 12:09.210
Lime wedges in the bottle's fine.

12:09.342 --> 12:11.611
Hey, asshole, I don't work here.

12:15.742 --> 12:20.477
I'm sorry. The paramedics will have to come
to get my foot out of my mouth, sweetheart.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.778
Just don't let it happen again.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.332
- I knew you didn't work here.
- You did?

12:25.470 --> 12:28.786
How else was I supposed to get you away
from all those guys?

12:29.470 --> 12:31.674
Why would you want to do that?

12:32.125 --> 12:35.421
Some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex.

12:35.613 --> 12:39.290
They like women, women like them.
Everything flows naturally.

12:40.094 --> 12:43.509
Back in college, I was just not one of them.

12:47.774 --> 12:50.588
I seemed to lack the basic understanding...

12:50.685 --> 12:53.140
that my peers just intuitively grasped.

12:53.245 --> 12:57.620
But like any late bloomer,
I was eager to make up for lost time.

13:00.381 --> 13:03.348
Her name was Cressida Baylor.

13:04.285 --> 13:07.285
Can you tell me
where the registration building is?

13:10.653 --> 13:12.988
And my life would never be the same.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.452
- I'm Alex.
- Cressida.

13:18.685 --> 13:20.954
What we had was beautiful.

13:26.525 --> 13:27.867
I love you.

13:30.524 --> 13:32.215
I love you so much.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.968
I love you, too, Alex.

13:41.084 --> 13:44.019
I know you don't love me
as much as I love you.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.834
But that's okay.
I'm just glad you love me at all.

13:47.933 --> 13:51.129
In retrospect,
I guess I may have come on a little strong.

13:55.165 --> 13:57.466
But the experience taught me a lot.

13:57.564 --> 13:58.808
Cressida!

14:02.524 --> 14:04.150
What are you doing?

14:04.252 --> 14:05.594
I'm sorry, Alex.

14:05.692 --> 14:09.914
But I love you. What did I do wrong?
Just tell me what I did wrong.

14:10.108 --> 14:12.083
You're doing it right now.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.613
Alex, I'm sorry.

14:18.044 --> 14:22.070
And it's an education
I feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men.

14:25.820 --> 14:29.781
Because with no guile and no game,
there's no girl.

14:31.132 --> 14:32.692
If ever a man born was without game...

14:34.204 --> 14:36.178
it was Albert Brennaman.

15:00.667 --> 15:05.271
My business is 100% referral
and, thus far, untraceable.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.127
And if there's one thing I've learned...

15:07.259 --> 15:10.805
when you orchestrate, coordinate,
and otherwise mess with fate...

15:10.939 --> 15:13.306
it's best to fly under the radar.

15:49.819 --> 15:52.088
I hope she's single
'cause I don't do break-ups.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.106
Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.519
Yeah, no.
I mean, she just got out of a relationship.

15:57.978 --> 16:00.880
Is that a problem?
Because if it is, that's fine.

16:01.018 --> 16:03.222
I'm a little uncomfortable with this anyway.

16:03.322 --> 16:07.381
Definitely been hurt a lot.
I had a lot of bad experiences.

16:07.482 --> 16:10.799
Some good ones.
But definitely a lot of bad ones.

16:11.482 --> 16:15.411
I'm desperate, basically.
I mean, not in general, you understand?

16:15.546 --> 16:19.091
You know, not just for anybody.
But, man, for her... Yeah.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.815
Why don't you tell me about her?

16:22.906 --> 16:24.946
Let's see, what can I say?

16:25.242 --> 16:28.787
My company handles her finances.
I'm her tax consultant.

16:29.306 --> 16:32.470
Well, I'm one of them.
I'm the junior man on the account.

16:32.569 --> 16:34.904
- So does she know you're interested?
- No.

16:38.906 --> 16:40.018
Alive?

16:41.050 --> 16:42.457
I lent her my pen once.

16:42.938 --> 16:45.141
Shoot. Does anyone have a pen?

16:45.274 --> 16:48.623
- Here, take mine.
- Albert, you're crushing my arm.

16:48.730 --> 16:51.152
Sorry about that. Here you go, Allegra.

16:54.234 --> 16:56.819
Allegra? As in Allegra Cole?

16:56.954 --> 16:59.572
Yeah, I realize that I'm not her usual type.

16:59.705 --> 17:03.349
Well, her last boyfriend owned Sweden
or something.

17:03.449 --> 17:05.107
And that guy was a bum.

17:05.209 --> 17:08.144
He didn't seem like
a very nice person to me.

17:09.146 --> 17:11.088
You swing for the fence.

17:11.258 --> 17:14.519
Look, you don't think I tried
talking myself out of this?

17:14.617 --> 17:18.294
I mean, you don't think I know
how ridiculous this is? I know, okay?

17:18.425 --> 17:21.721
I just thought that maybe with your help...

17:23.704 --> 17:27.534
You know what?
I'm really sorry I wasted your time.

17:38.489 --> 17:40.464
Hold on a second, Albert.

17:42.904 --> 17:46.833
You know what it's like
getting up every morning feeling hopeless?

17:47.033 --> 17:50.382
Feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man?

17:50.488 --> 17:55.191
But at the same time,
hoping that she still finds happiness...

17:55.673 --> 17:58.390
even if it's never gonna be with you?

17:59.705 --> 18:02.388
You are flat-out...

18:03.224 --> 18:06.258
out of your mind. You know that?

18:10.008 --> 18:11.383
That's good.

18:12.472 --> 18:13.585
It is?

18:14.488 --> 18:16.757
You ever heard of Michelangelo?

18:16.856 --> 18:18.995
Heard of the Sistine Chapel?

18:20.472 --> 18:21.879
Michelangelo.

18:22.776 --> 18:24.270
Sistine Chapel.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.195
You saying you can do this?

18:26.297 --> 18:29.712
My name is Alex Hitchens.
Let's go paint that ceiling.

18:58.008 --> 18:59.415
Take it easy.

19:00.728 --> 19:02.102
Oh, my God!

19:46.103 --> 19:48.524
Well, it looks like I'm still rich.

19:52.023 --> 19:56.179
But what I would really like,
and what I was wondering is...

19:57.431 --> 20:01.326
if I could have $500,000
to invest on my own.

20:03.255 --> 20:07.183
And what were you thinking
of investing in, Allegra?

20:08.630 --> 20:13.071
Well, it's something
that I really have a passion for.

20:18.903 --> 20:21.139
Daydreams are for private time.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.633
When you're in the room, be in the room.

20:23.734 --> 20:27.214
Concentrate. Focus.
Women respond when you respond to them.

20:27.414 --> 20:30.131
My friend Maggie is a talented designer.

20:30.550 --> 20:34.706
I've seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic.

20:35.702 --> 20:39.630
And I would really like to get involved.

20:44.054 --> 20:45.647
I'll tell you what.

20:45.782 --> 20:50.255
Let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in...

20:50.390 --> 20:53.838
and next month,
we'll run the whole lot of them by you.

20:56.822 --> 20:57.770
Okay.

20:57.910 --> 21:00.299
Fine. Thank you. All right, gentlemen.

21:00.822 --> 21:03.309
Let's go over this one more time.
What is the objective?

21:03.414 --> 21:04.788
Shock and awe.

21:04.918 --> 21:07.667
That was shockingly awful.
What is the objective?

21:07.798 --> 21:08.910
Shock and awe.

21:09.014 --> 21:11.283
What is the objective?

21:12.054 --> 21:14.737
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Albert?

21:22.037 --> 21:25.201
I don't really agree with that.

21:25.302 --> 21:27.691
You don't really agree with what?

21:34.102 --> 21:37.363
I think if you want to invest $500,000
in your friend's business...

21:37.461 --> 21:38.890
that's exactly what you should do.

21:39.029 --> 21:41.713
You don't need us to tell you what to do.

21:41.813 --> 21:44.748
We're a board of advisers,
not your kindergarten teachers.

21:44.853 --> 21:46.992
If you want to be taken seriously
as an adult...

21:47.093 --> 21:49.362
then start taking yourself seriously
as an adult...

21:49.461 --> 21:52.309
instead of asking for permission
to invest your own money...

21:52.437 --> 21:55.023
from a boardroom
full of your daddy's golf buddies.

21:55.157 --> 21:56.815
- That's quite enough!
- I'm not finished.

21:56.949 --> 22:00.975
I'd like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity...

22:01.109 --> 22:04.622
that she's had to deal with her whole life,
with half her class.

22:06.837 --> 22:10.798
We should be taking advice from you,
Miss Cole. Not the other way around.

22:10.901 --> 22:13.551
- Sit down...
- No! You know what? I quit!

22:23.509 --> 22:24.818
Oh, my God.

22:34.548 --> 22:37.134
Just breathe. How'd it go?

22:37.268 --> 22:40.650
I yelled at her. I screamed at my boss!
I quit my job!

22:41.172 --> 22:42.863
- What?
- You said...

22:43.221 --> 22:45.676
- I gotta go back.
- No, I didn't tell you to quit.

22:45.780 --> 22:47.471
Relax. Okay, listen, we're fine.

22:47.572 --> 22:49.939
- Would you let me go?
- Albert, no!

22:51.253 --> 22:54.002
Just relax! Okay?

22:54.516 --> 22:57.745
- Just let it marinate for a second. Trust me.
- No!

23:07.636 --> 23:09.578
Relax.

23:09.716 --> 23:11.756
- It's Allegra Cole.
- Answer it.

23:11.860 --> 23:15.275
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Answer the door, Albert.

23:19.540 --> 23:20.750
Yes. Hi.

23:21.492 --> 23:22.833
What's up?

23:23.155 --> 23:24.978
Listen, Albert, right?

23:25.779 --> 23:30.514
- People don't usually talk to me like that.
- Close your mouth, man.

23:30.612 --> 23:33.100
Let me rephrase that.

23:33.236 --> 23:35.953
People never talk to me like that.

23:37.491 --> 23:38.636
Stand up.

23:38.740 --> 23:41.390
I guess it's kind of scary for them.

23:42.195 --> 23:45.905
But that's why I really appreciate
what you did in there.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.073
But I was wondering...

23:49.171 --> 23:53.230
do you think that you and I could
get together sometime this week?

23:55.220 --> 23:57.772
You know, to go over things.

23:58.708 --> 24:00.398
Financial things.

24:00.499 --> 24:04.460
I'd like to see the areas
where I can afford to take some risks.

24:04.595 --> 24:06.831
- Check your schedule.
- I'll check my schedule.

24:06.931 --> 24:10.226
Great. Let me give you my number.
Do you have a pen?

24:10.451 --> 24:12.458
I don't think I have one.

24:17.171 --> 24:18.861
- Yes, I do.
- Great.

24:30.579 --> 24:32.302
And call me Allegra.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.390
- You're done.
- Goodbye.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.222
Good job.

24:44.979 --> 24:45.993
Oh, damn.

25:06.578 --> 25:10.800
She's some kind of newspaper columnist.
Comes in here once in a while. Great tipper.

25:10.898 --> 25:11.913
What's her drink?

25:12.018 --> 25:15.182
Usually beer.
Tonight, Grey Goose martini, dirty.

25:25.074 --> 25:26.056
Hi.

25:27.922 --> 25:29.547
I noticed your glass was getting low...

25:29.682 --> 25:32.431
so I took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini.

25:32.562 --> 25:33.510
Thank you.

25:33.618 --> 25:37.480
And I couldn't help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend.

25:38.034 --> 25:40.423
- What's your name?
- They call me Chip.

25:40.562 --> 25:42.634
You can't get them to stop?

25:43.761 --> 25:44.906
That was funny.

25:45.041 --> 25:48.390
Listen, I understand the courage it takes
to walk across a room...

25:48.498 --> 25:50.919
and try to generate a relationship
out of thin air.

25:51.026 --> 25:54.670
- So don't take the following personally.
- You have fantastic eyes.

25:56.018 --> 25:57.872
Thanks. Try to listen.

25:58.001 --> 26:01.798
This is no reflection on you.
I'm just not interested.

26:02.097 --> 26:04.464
But thank you for the compliment
of coming over.

26:04.593 --> 26:07.343
You're welcome.
So do you like Cuban food?

26:08.081 --> 26:11.823
Chip, seriously, that was not code for,
"I wish you'd try harder."

26:11.953 --> 26:15.913
Are you always so shut-down and afraid
that the right man might make you...

26:16.017 --> 26:18.024
Feel like a natural woman?

26:18.801 --> 26:21.867
Sorry I'm late, honey.
I couldn't get a cab. How was the meeting?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.513
Well, there was a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

26:25.937 --> 26:27.825
Nice to meet you, Chip.

26:32.912 --> 26:34.189
You, too.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.657
On the one hand,
it is very difficult for a man...

26:39.792 --> 26:42.378
to even speak to someone
who looks like you.

26:42.512 --> 26:45.578
But on the other hand,
should that be your problem?

26:45.712 --> 26:48.101
So life's kind of hard all around.

26:48.721 --> 26:50.957
Not if you pay attention.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.607
You're sending all the right signals:

26:54.704 --> 26:58.021
no earrings, heels under two inches,
your hair is pulled back...

26:58.161 --> 27:01.641
wearing reading glasses with no book,
drinking a Grey Goose martini...

27:01.744 --> 27:04.876
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldn't do it.

27:04.976 --> 27:06.285
If that wasn't clear enough...

27:06.384 --> 27:10.345
there's always the "fuck off"
that you have stamped on your forehead.

27:10.480 --> 27:14.604
Who'd believe there's a man out there
that can sit by a woman he doesn't know...

27:14.704 --> 27:18.632
and genuinely be interested in who she is,
what she does, without his own agenda?

27:18.736 --> 27:21.551
I wouldn't even know
what that would look like.

27:21.712 --> 27:23.622
So what would a guy like that say?

27:23.760 --> 27:27.021
He'd say, "My name is Alex Hitchens
and I'm a consultant."

27:27.152 --> 27:28.908
But she wouldn't be interested in that...

27:29.040 --> 27:31.407
because she'd be counting the seconds
until he left.

27:31.504 --> 27:33.893
Thinking he was like every other guy.

27:34.032 --> 27:37.098
Which, life experience has taught her,
is a virtual certainty.

27:37.231 --> 27:39.915
But then he'd ask her name
and what she did for a living...

27:40.015 --> 27:42.120
and she might blow him off.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.043
Or she might say...

27:48.399 --> 27:52.141
I'm Sara Melas.
I run the gossip column at the Standard.

27:52.272 --> 27:55.119
And then he'd ask
all these penetrating questions about her...

27:55.216 --> 27:58.314
because he was sincerely,
if atypically, interested.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.430
No.

27:59.791 --> 28:02.126
- No?
- He'd be interested.

28:03.471 --> 28:05.544
But he'd see that there was no way...

28:05.679 --> 28:09.323
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real.

28:09.423 --> 28:14.344
Well, he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.558
Wouldn't help.

28:16.655 --> 28:19.655
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Not really.

28:19.791 --> 28:23.336
They'd both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward.

28:23.471 --> 28:26.154
My guess is they'd do just fine.

28:28.175 --> 28:31.109
It's a pleasure to have met you, Sara Melas.

28:35.951 --> 28:39.267
Grey Goose martini
from the gentleman who just left.

28:44.430 --> 28:45.957
Is that for me?

28:48.655 --> 28:49.735
What?

29:04.398 --> 29:06.537
Vance Munson. Sorry I'm late.

29:07.502 --> 29:10.285
No, not a problem.

29:11.470 --> 29:13.193
Wow, you're the...

29:14.094 --> 29:17.672
- Can I get you something to drink, Mr...
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

29:17.775 --> 29:19.563
So, tell me about her.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.559
Have you ever met someone...

29:23.662 --> 29:26.345
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you?

29:26.478 --> 29:29.739
Not just because of her looks,
but that X factor.

29:30.734 --> 29:32.195
How'd you meet her?

29:32.302 --> 29:35.564
Actually, I was in a shop
buying pajamas for my mom.

29:35.662 --> 29:37.485
And by that, of course, you mean...

29:37.582 --> 29:40.397
you were buying lingerie
for another woman.

29:41.710 --> 29:45.190
Yes. You can't help
where you meet somebody.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.291
And the lingerie is for a woman
I'm no longer seeing.

29:48.430 --> 29:51.179
But anyway, the girl I met,
the one I was talking about...

29:51.310 --> 29:53.895
she's so sweet, funny, Southern.

29:54.030 --> 29:56.932
She gives me her number.
Now she won't return my phone calls.

29:57.070 --> 30:00.583
I don't know what it is about her.
I just can't get her out of my mind.

30:00.718 --> 30:04.580
You know, food has lost its taste.
Colors, they seem dull.

30:04.717 --> 30:08.295
Things that used to matter...
I don't know, they just no longer do.

30:08.429 --> 30:11.277
I think things aren't gonna snap back
unless I...

30:13.102 --> 30:14.760
Unless I bang her.

30:16.877 --> 30:18.187
Excuse me?

30:19.853 --> 30:23.170
You know, bang her. Clear my head.
Get in, get off, get out.

30:25.837 --> 30:29.001
I think you may have misunderstood
what I do exactly.

30:29.101 --> 30:31.719
No, I was told you help guys get in there.

30:31.821 --> 30:33.676
Right. But, see, here's the thing.

30:33.773 --> 30:37.034
My clients actually like women.

30:39.661 --> 30:41.995
Hit it and quit it is not my thing.

30:42.093 --> 30:45.868
Let me make one thing clear to you, rabbi.
I need professional help.

30:45.996 --> 30:48.680
Well, that is for damn certain.

30:49.101 --> 30:53.476
And I'm glad you can admit it
because generally that's the hardest part.

30:56.301 --> 30:59.301
You see what I'm doing?
This is what I'm about.

31:00.173 --> 31:02.344
Power suit, power tie, power steering.

31:02.476 --> 31:06.338
People can wince, cry, beg,
but eventually they do what I want.

31:08.173 --> 31:10.180
So that's, like, a metaphor.

31:12.653 --> 31:15.402
Well, I'm more of a literal kind of guy.

31:15.501 --> 31:17.224
So when I do this...

31:19.181 --> 31:23.272
this is more like me saying
that I will literally break your shit off...

31:23.373 --> 31:26.122
if you ever touch me again. Okay, pumpkin?

31:26.220 --> 31:27.398
Got it.

31:35.116 --> 31:37.003
No.

31:37.100 --> 31:41.191
Pablo, I can't just mention your restaurant.
Somebody has to eat there.

31:41.292 --> 31:44.107
No, somebody famous. You know that.

31:44.396 --> 31:45.957
- Sara Melas?
- No.

31:46.827 --> 31:48.354
Okay. Bye.

31:50.348 --> 31:52.104
I need your signature.

32:05.739 --> 32:10.212
I hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number.

32:10.348 --> 32:12.682
So this is me not calling. Over.

32:12.780 --> 32:15.627
Yes, you're right.
This is much less invasive.

32:15.755 --> 32:18.505
I've been thinking about
that sign on your forehead.

32:18.635 --> 32:22.465
And I was wondering if you'd mind
taking it down for dinner Friday night. Over.

32:22.892 --> 32:26.055
I can't. I have a couple of parties
I have to hit.

32:26.699 --> 32:28.292
Gossip never sleeps.

32:28.779 --> 32:30.688
Not till about 4:00 a.m.

32:31.180 --> 32:32.423
Saturday.

32:35.307 --> 32:36.736
I have a date.

32:38.219 --> 32:41.001
Do you know the definition
of "perseverance," Miss Melas?

32:41.099 --> 32:43.106
An excuse to be obnoxious?

32:43.275 --> 32:45.184
Continuing in a course of action...

32:45.291 --> 32:49.382
without regard to discouragement,
opposition or previous failure. Over.

32:49.739 --> 32:51.746
Okay, Webster, how do I get rid of you?

32:51.851 --> 32:54.699
Breakfast, Sunday.
And you can barely even call that a date.

32:54.827 --> 32:58.537
You do that with out-of-town relatives
that you don't even like. Over.

33:02.379 --> 33:03.589
Come on.

33:05.995 --> 33:08.264
Okay, I guess I could do Sunday.

33:08.811 --> 33:11.080
You forgot to say "over." Over.

33:11.531 --> 33:14.465
This conversation's over
as soon as you tell me when and where.

33:14.571 --> 33:17.418
7:00 a.m., North Cove Marina. Over and out.

33:17.867 --> 33:21.576
7:00 a.m.? Are you crazy?
I don't do 7:00 a.m.

33:23.467 --> 33:24.776
- Hello?
- Sign here.

33:25.195 --> 33:26.755
- What?
- You said Sunday, right?

33:26.859 --> 33:27.939
Yeah.

33:30.794 --> 33:33.161
What if I would have said Friday?

33:33.258 --> 33:34.436
Sunday.

33:38.474 --> 33:41.093
So I guess you're not going to church.

33:53.386 --> 33:55.972
Do you really expect me to wear this?

33:57.450 --> 33:59.871
lt'll be awful cold out there without it.

33:59.978 --> 34:02.977
- Good morning.
- "Good" would have been at 10:00.

34:07.210 --> 34:09.414
You're a lot taller than I remember.

34:09.545 --> 34:11.400
You ever ride one of these?

34:11.496 --> 34:13.090
Not on the Hudson.

34:13.226 --> 34:16.094
So, what do you wanna do?
Race me around the Statue of Liberty?

34:16.233 --> 34:17.793
If there's time.

34:18.217 --> 34:20.737
- But you might need these.
- All right.

34:20.873 --> 34:22.183
- Bam.
- Wow.

34:23.338 --> 34:24.766
How do I look?

34:25.993 --> 34:27.237
Fabulous.

34:28.969 --> 34:30.627
All right, I give.

34:31.434 --> 34:32.994
Where do I change?

34:33.929 --> 34:38.337
So we'll go past the wall, then take a left.
It's pretty much a straight shot from there.

34:38.473 --> 34:41.572
- Straight shot to where?
- That's for me to know and you to find out.

34:41.705 --> 34:43.297
What you do with these babies is...

34:43.433 --> 34:46.498
Yeah, what I do with this baby
is kick your ass.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.021
- What happened? You change your mind?
- It just died.

35:59.144 --> 36:00.705
Did you put gas in it?

36:01.256 --> 36:05.053
No. You know, I think it must have
sucked up a diaper or something.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.527
Gross. Try it again.

36:11.176 --> 36:12.703
You want me to call AAA?

36:12.808 --> 36:15.197
Come on around
and let me hop on with you.

36:15.336 --> 36:18.881
I don't know. What if you break mine, too?
Then we'll both be sitting ducks.

36:19.015 --> 36:22.528
- I didn't break it. It just died.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:22.663 --> 36:24.573
All right, hop on.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.771
- Scoot back.
- Hitch, I'm already here.

36:29.319 --> 36:31.010
But you don't know where we're going.

36:31.143 --> 36:33.729
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

36:36.424 --> 36:37.984
Man, male egos.

36:38.088 --> 36:40.804
I don't know how you guys
make it through the day with them.

36:40.936 --> 36:42.943
What? It is not my ego.

36:43.048 --> 36:45.698
I just don't want to ruin the surprise.

36:55.367 --> 36:58.018
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

37:00.039 --> 37:02.853
There. I always keep a few of those around.

37:02.983 --> 37:03.965
Thank you.

37:04.103 --> 37:07.900
I have lower back trouble.
I just shove the ice packs right down there.

37:08.422 --> 37:10.245
No. That's a fresh one.

37:12.039 --> 37:13.665
So, Ellis Island.

37:13.927 --> 37:17.888
I have to admit, I have lived in New York
my whole life and I've never been here.

37:18.022 --> 37:19.484
I figured that. Most people haven't.

37:19.623 --> 37:22.078
So I got my man Larry here
to set us up a private tour.

37:22.215 --> 37:24.125
- Great!
- Anything for Hitch.

37:25.702 --> 37:28.801
It was originally known as Oyster Island.

37:28.935 --> 37:31.488
The island was expanded
to its present size...

37:31.622 --> 37:35.583
with dirt removed during the construction
of the New York subway system.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.821
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

37:37.927 --> 37:41.026
- Did you know this?
- Yeah. That's why I brought you here.

37:41.126 --> 37:45.731
In fact, over 100 million Americans
can trace their ancestry...

37:45.862 --> 37:49.724
back to a single man, woman, or child
on the ship's manifest...

37:49.862 --> 37:51.804
to an inspector's ledger.

37:52.358 --> 37:57.115
By 1910, 75%% of the residents of New York...

37:57.254 --> 38:00.418
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston...

38:00.518 --> 38:03.201
were immigrants,
or the children of immigrants.

38:03.334 --> 38:06.717
They generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities...

38:06.854 --> 38:10.782
in Little Italys, Chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves.

38:11.174 --> 38:13.279
It's called The Kissing Post.

38:13.798 --> 38:17.988
The plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences.

38:18.854 --> 38:22.018
Now, what exactly would qualify
as a long absence?

38:22.534 --> 38:23.843
I mean...

38:24.678 --> 38:27.012
- That count?
- No.

38:30.437 --> 38:34.529
I actually had a relative come through here.

38:35.077 --> 38:36.539
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:38.661 --> 38:39.741
What?

38:40.614 --> 38:43.647
- What?
- What was that thing?

38:44.806 --> 38:48.101
No. You know, I was just thinking...

38:48.517 --> 38:52.227
you can't really know where you're going
until you know where you've been.

38:52.325 --> 38:55.107
- Ain't that right, Larry?
- Amen, brother.

38:55.301 --> 38:58.684
That's kind of deep for a first date,
don't you think?

39:02.021 --> 39:03.428
What is that?

39:21.253 --> 39:22.944
Oh, my God!

39:29.221 --> 39:33.727
That's my great-great-grandfather.
That's his signature.

39:33.861 --> 39:35.770
Jesus, it's right here!

39:38.661 --> 39:40.635
How did you know?

39:41.541 --> 39:44.443
Hitch did the search. I just found the page.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.449
I'm sorry.

40:17.380 --> 40:20.479
I saw that going differently in my mind.

40:22.820 --> 40:27.097
So my family never saw him again.
Well, except for on the Wanted posters.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.729
Look, I'm really sorry.

40:30.212 --> 40:34.009
When I saw it on the computer,
it said, "the Butcher of Cádiz."

40:35.652 --> 40:40.223
I thought it was a profession,
not a headline.

40:41.572 --> 40:46.045
It's just one of those horrible family legacies
we've all tried to forget.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.129
But thank you.

40:48.259 --> 40:49.536
No, it was...

40:49.635 --> 40:51.643
- A train wreck.
- No.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.187
Let me get you a cab.

40:57.796 --> 40:59.006
Thanks.

41:01.219 --> 41:03.042
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

41:12.451 --> 41:13.531
Taxi!

41:17.091 --> 41:19.546
Poor guy.
Sounds like he went to a lot of trouble.

41:19.651 --> 41:24.288
It was fun. In a disastrous kind of way.
I mean, this isn't exactly a hickey.

41:25.379 --> 41:28.379
At least you got a good story
out of it, right?

41:30.723 --> 41:31.738
Right?

41:31.843 --> 41:35.258
- You should try mine, it's great.
- Wait. You're seeing him again?

41:36.770 --> 41:40.382
Well, look, you said that
I'm always expecting men...

41:40.483 --> 41:43.417
to let me down, right?
Assuming that they're gonna fail?

41:43.523 --> 41:44.930
Which he did.

41:45.731 --> 41:48.600
Yeah, but he did it with flair.

41:50.755 --> 41:53.438
I mean, Case, he really tanked.

41:53.538 --> 41:55.677
And that's a desirable trait?

41:56.418 --> 41:59.101
Yeah. Weird, huh?

42:01.538 --> 42:04.026
Now, just keep it simple.
Just like we practiced.

42:04.162 --> 42:05.591
We're just leaving a message.

42:05.699 --> 42:08.797
Women like Allegra Cole
don't pick up numbers they don't recognize.

42:12.194 --> 42:13.307
Hello?

42:13.922 --> 42:15.580
She's on the phone!

42:18.082 --> 42:19.970
- Yes. Hello, Miss Cole?
- Yeah.

42:20.066 --> 42:22.073
Hi, I have Albert Brennaman for you.

42:22.178 --> 42:24.545
- One moment, please.
- No. Tell her I'm at lunch.

42:24.642 --> 42:27.457
We called her to tell her you're at lunch?

42:31.906 --> 42:35.800
Allegra. Hi, it's Albert Brennaman.

42:36.898 --> 42:38.458
Hi, how are you?

42:38.657 --> 42:40.796
Good. I'm doing good.

42:41.185 --> 42:44.120
The reason I'm calling
is about our appointment this Wednesday.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.494
Not gonna be able to make it.

42:47.553 --> 42:49.561
Well, when can you make it?

42:50.177 --> 42:51.552
When can I do it?

42:54.881 --> 42:58.045
I don't even know,
because my whole next week is slammed.

42:58.754 --> 43:01.307
Right. But it's all good.

43:03.617 --> 43:06.137
No, we're gonna make it happen though,
that's for sure.

43:06.753 --> 43:08.542
We're going to make it happen. Yes.

43:16.961 --> 43:18.368
What's going on over there?

43:18.466 --> 43:20.767
Just moving some things around.

43:22.753 --> 43:23.997
Sky Studios.

43:24.097 --> 43:27.359
Tonight I'm actually going
to this fashion thing at Sky Studios.

43:27.457 --> 43:28.668
Designer friend.

43:28.801 --> 43:32.696
I just thought it might be something
your designer friend would be interested in.

43:32.833 --> 43:34.109
Yeah, definitely.

43:34.241 --> 43:37.819
Well, great.
Then I will put you back on with my...

43:55.681 --> 43:57.884
- Allegra, over here, please.
- Miss Cole, this way.

43:57.984 --> 43:59.261
Great. One more.

43:59.360 --> 44:02.360
- Hi, there.
- This was a fantastic idea.

44:02.657 --> 44:04.926
I suppose. Hey, where's Maggie?

44:05.441 --> 44:06.902
Late as usual.

44:08.993 --> 44:12.605
Tonight I want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.716
Do you know why I want you to do that?

44:14.976 --> 44:16.602
Because I'm cool?

44:16.704 --> 44:18.460
- No.
- I know, I'm not.

44:19.201 --> 44:20.989
I'm saying that you are an iceberg...

44:21.121 --> 44:24.950
in that over 90%% of your mass
is below the surface.

44:25.632 --> 44:27.639
I know I'm heavy. I am.

44:27.744 --> 44:31.039
I'm talking about who you are.
It's a metaphor.

44:31.136 --> 44:32.445
Accounting, business...

44:32.544 --> 44:36.951
all of that is just a small part
of a much deeper, richer Albert.

44:38.144 --> 44:39.388
One more.

44:40.704 --> 44:41.948
It's gonna be loud in there...

44:42.080 --> 44:44.601
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier...

44:44.704 --> 44:45.914
in a non-sleazy way.

44:46.016 --> 44:48.918
So get to where it's loudest.
Ask her if she'd like a drink.

44:49.024 --> 44:51.358
Lean in, place your hand
on the small of her back...

44:51.456 --> 44:53.179
and say it in her ear like a secret.

44:53.311 --> 44:56.573
Watch your hand placement.
Too high says, "I just wanna be friends."

44:56.672 --> 44:58.941
Too low says, "I just wanna grab some ass."

45:00.000 --> 45:02.520
Friends. Ass. Me.

45:07.584 --> 45:09.973
Special issues: Allegra Cole is a celebrity...

45:10.112 --> 45:13.428
which means that when people talk to her,
they'll ignore you completely.

45:13.535 --> 45:15.226
She's classy, so she'll introduce you.

45:15.359 --> 45:18.742
When she does, shake hands hard
and speak up. Let them know you're there.

45:18.847 --> 45:20.636
Show her you can handle being her escort.

45:20.736 --> 45:23.802
- Egon, this is Albert.
- How you doing?

45:23.999 --> 45:26.138
- Albert, this is Zak.
- Nice to see you.

45:26.559 --> 45:28.347
These guys are friends with Maggie.

45:28.575 --> 45:31.509
- Been to that new Brazilian restaurant?
- No, but I am...

45:31.615 --> 45:34.103
It's disgusting.
I'm writing an article about it.

45:35.231 --> 45:37.271
Did you see the new installation at MOMA?

45:37.503 --> 45:40.121
- Yes, did you think...
- Disgusting.

45:41.663 --> 45:44.761
Women can always tell
when you're not being real with them.

45:45.055 --> 45:48.404
Worst thing you can do is try to fake it,
because you are a great guy.

45:48.734 --> 45:51.964
And you do have something
to offer Allegra that no other man does.

45:52.830 --> 45:54.237
What was your name? Eggnog?

45:55.999 --> 45:57.079
Egon.

45:57.567 --> 46:01.342
What do you think of the design of the Jets'
new football stadium on the West Side?

46:01.855 --> 46:04.059
Let me guess. Disgusting?

46:04.927 --> 46:06.749
Think it over. We'll be back.

46:09.054 --> 46:12.054
Thank you. I can't stand those guys.

46:12.190 --> 46:14.295
Really? I kind of liked them.

46:14.431 --> 46:16.154
But when all is said and done...

46:16.351 --> 46:18.838
tonight is not about Allegra.

46:19.614 --> 46:22.200
- It's not?
- No. Tonight is about Maggie.

46:22.558 --> 46:26.355
A woman's best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions.

46:26.527 --> 46:28.152
So you can't afford to mess this up.

46:28.254 --> 46:30.621
Albert, I want you to meet
my friend, Maggie.

46:31.134 --> 46:33.851
Hi, Maggie.
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

46:33.982 --> 46:35.291
I'm Maggie.

46:36.190 --> 46:39.190
- No, you're not.
- Actually, I am.

46:39.646 --> 46:42.942
Magnus Forester.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

46:45.119 --> 46:47.158
- You have very soft hands.
- Thank you.

46:49.374 --> 46:51.675
- Wow. So do you.
- Thank you.

46:51.774 --> 46:55.549
So tonight, you focus on one thing
and one thing only.

46:55.902 --> 46:56.763
Maggie.

46:56.926 --> 47:00.309
- Where does your inspiration come from?
- Oh, my God.

47:01.150 --> 47:02.611
Anything I see.

47:03.070 --> 47:06.615
Something in a magazine,
out on the street...

47:07.230 --> 47:08.244
in an old movie.

47:09.214 --> 47:12.662
The receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me.

47:13.469 --> 47:14.963
Anybody want any spring rolls?

47:15.102 --> 47:18.265
That's a beautiful tie, by the way.
This whole thing, it just works.

47:18.589 --> 47:19.899
Thank you.

47:21.501 --> 47:24.152
- Is he gay?
- I don't think so.

47:25.757 --> 47:26.706
I like him.

47:26.813 --> 47:31.352
About the deejay.
Generally, I have a firm no-dancing policy.

47:31.453 --> 47:34.235
But if she asks, you cannot say no.

47:34.333 --> 47:37.082
I'm not worried about dancing.
But if there are people there...

47:37.181 --> 47:41.458
I'm sorry, I hate to be a stickler,
but I need to be thorough.

47:42.653 --> 47:45.075
Show me what you mean
by you're not worried about it.

47:45.181 --> 47:47.320
Trust me. You know what I'm gonna do.

47:50.301 --> 47:52.308
That's what it's all about, right there.

47:53.021 --> 47:54.265
See how it gets bigger?

47:57.405 --> 47:58.867
Now I'm gonna start the fire.

47:59.197 --> 48:02.841
But the feet are going.
I start the fire, I make the pizza.

48:03.132 --> 48:04.343
Hips are always going.

48:05.981 --> 48:07.191
Can't get enough hip.

48:07.421 --> 48:09.788
From there, the Q-Tip.

48:10.812 --> 48:14.009
Q-Tip. Throw it away.

48:14.716 --> 48:16.659
That's not working, hit them with this.

48:25.053 --> 48:27.704
Don't ever...

48:28.604 --> 48:29.651
do that again.

48:31.292 --> 48:32.405
Do you hear me?

48:33.212 --> 48:35.001
- Just expressing myself.
- No.

48:36.413 --> 48:39.479
Not like that, you're not, all right?

48:42.364 --> 48:43.739
This is where you live.

48:44.605 --> 48:45.946
Right here.

48:46.044 --> 48:48.913
You live right here, okay? This is home.

48:49.532 --> 48:50.514
None of this.

48:51.132 --> 48:52.725
I don't wanna see none of that.

48:52.828 --> 48:54.835
Don't need no pizza. They got food there.

49:02.716 --> 49:05.683
Elbows, 6 inches from the waist,
90-degree angles.

49:06.236 --> 49:08.408
Don't you bite your lip. Stop it.

49:27.292 --> 49:30.161
Women relate dancing to sex, all right?

49:30.268 --> 49:33.137
Even a great dancer can lose it
with one of these.

49:34.203 --> 49:36.659
Okay, now that's what I need to be learning.

49:47.323 --> 49:48.567
Can't stop it.

49:49.211 --> 49:51.000
You cannot stop it.

49:53.339 --> 49:54.451
Next subject.

49:56.475 --> 49:57.423
Get out.

50:02.363 --> 50:03.541
Thanks.

50:03.963 --> 50:05.970
So, are you a Knicks fan?

50:07.930 --> 50:09.556
When they're good.

50:15.835 --> 50:17.907
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, God. Why?

50:19.163 --> 50:21.432
- She was there?
- I left you a bunch of messages.

50:21.915 --> 50:23.475
My phone fell in the Hudson.

50:23.611 --> 50:24.920
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

50:28.698 --> 50:29.713
I don't believe this.

50:29.818 --> 50:33.593
- I thought he was a bodyguard.
- I'm the only one who will need protection.

50:33.979 --> 50:36.280
- Max is gonna...
- Gonna be really irritated.

50:36.890 --> 50:40.239
When I got the train this morning,
I thought it was gonna be a good day.

50:41.178 --> 50:43.545
Who the hell is Albert Brennaman?

50:44.058 --> 50:47.124
- Tell me how this happened.
- What? There were some photographers.

50:47.258 --> 50:49.233
Does this even look like dancing to you?

50:49.626 --> 50:51.448
That's just a little bit of me being me.

50:51.579 --> 50:55.954
No, that's you being a lot of something
you don't need to ever be again.

50:56.283 --> 50:57.744
- It's just one dance.
- No.

50:58.394 --> 51:02.704
One dance, one look, one kiss.
That's all we get, Albert.

51:02.906 --> 51:05.459
Just one shot to make the difference...

51:05.562 --> 51:07.951
between happily ever after and:

51:08.186 --> 51:11.666
"Oh, he's just some guy
I went to some thing with once."

51:12.602 --> 51:13.551
All right?

51:19.002 --> 51:21.620
- What?
- You said "kiss."

51:24.218 --> 51:25.647
Is that a problem?

51:26.522 --> 51:29.042
It's not a problem, but this is Allegra Cole.

51:29.146 --> 51:31.382
Eight out of 10 women believe
that the first kiss...

51:31.482 --> 51:34.384
will tell them everything they need to know
about a relationship.

51:34.489 --> 51:37.785
And believe me,
she has definitely thought about it.

51:38.233 --> 51:40.470
- She has?
- Of course.

51:40.570 --> 51:44.050
Not that she's gonna act on it.
So it's no real big deal.

51:44.282 --> 51:47.151
- All right, it's no big deal then.
- It's a very big deal!

51:47.258 --> 51:48.665
- Huge.
- Monumental!

51:48.762 --> 51:50.649
You are not listening...

51:52.058 --> 51:54.098
I need you to wrap your head around this.

51:54.201 --> 51:56.885
Tomorrow night, Allegra Cole...

51:57.210 --> 52:00.723
could have her last first kiss.

52:11.257 --> 52:13.461
All right, come on,
just show me what you got.

52:14.265 --> 52:16.818
- What do you mean?
- Just show me how you would kiss me.

52:17.561 --> 52:18.674
I wouldn't kiss you.

52:19.129 --> 52:20.503
I'm not me, I'm Allegra.

52:23.257 --> 52:24.817
But you're really not, so...

52:24.921 --> 52:28.630
Okay, Albert, end of the night,
you're dropping me off at home.

52:28.857 --> 52:31.344
- Show me the magic.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

52:31.449 --> 52:34.896
God, Albert,
I had such a wonderful time with you.

52:35.001 --> 52:36.627
Yeah, how about those Knicks?

52:37.561 --> 52:41.936
You see what I'm doing?
This is a signal. I'm fiddling with my keys.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.567
A woman that doesn't want a kiss...

52:43.704 --> 52:46.421
takes her keys out, puts them in the door,
goes in the house.

52:46.521 --> 52:48.528
A woman that wants to kiss, she fiddles.

52:49.816 --> 52:51.125
I'm fiddling.

52:51.256 --> 52:53.012
Okay, you have a good night now...

52:54.297 --> 52:56.435
- You see what I'm doing?
- Robbing me?

52:56.536 --> 52:57.551
No.

52:57.880 --> 53:00.531
This is what most guys do.
They rush in to take the kiss.

53:00.856 --> 53:02.351
But you're not most guys.

53:03.128 --> 53:07.056
See, the secret to a kiss
is to go 90%% of the way...

53:08.153 --> 53:09.298
and then hold.

53:14.104 --> 53:16.177
- For how long?
- As long as it takes...

53:16.728 --> 53:18.484
for her to come the other 10%% .

53:18.616 --> 53:20.404
Okay, 90%% -10%% . Got it.

53:20.536 --> 53:23.699
Okay, come on. Shake it off. It's your turn.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.556
I had a really nice time tonight, Albert.

53:32.055 --> 53:35.154
I had a great time tonight, too, Allegra...

53:37.048 --> 53:38.455
with a beard.

54:10.583 --> 54:11.511
What's up?

54:12.375 --> 54:15.092
- I'm not feeling it.
- What do you mean? I came 90%% .

54:15.223 --> 54:17.165
I'm not feeling like you want it.

54:17.272 --> 54:21.581
Look, I'm Allegra Cole,
the woman of your dreams.

54:21.687 --> 54:25.299
The woman whose green eyes
are limpid pools of desire.

54:25.399 --> 54:27.603
Now, show me the magic, Albert.

54:28.055 --> 54:30.357
- What the hell was that?
- I'm showing you the magic!

54:30.487 --> 54:32.494
No, I said come 90%% and then I come 10%%!

54:32.599 --> 54:34.093
You don't go the whole 100%%!

54:34.199 --> 54:37.548
My mouth was open, Albert.
You overeager son of a...

54:40.951 --> 54:42.358
Other than that, how was it?

54:43.350 --> 54:46.384
They came together, they danced together,
and they left together.

54:46.871 --> 54:49.238
He's cute, in a sheepdog kind of way.

54:49.399 --> 54:51.308
For all I know, he's adorable.

54:51.638 --> 54:53.777
But him dating her is...

54:53.943 --> 54:55.404
You seem stressed.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.201
You and I had an understanding.

54:57.302 --> 54:59.691
If you invite Allegra,
you're supposed to call me.

54:59.863 --> 55:01.292
I didn't invite her.

55:01.494 --> 55:03.949
Honestly, sweetie,
I thought she was still in Europe.

55:04.055 --> 55:06.259
- So you invited Albert?
- No.

55:06.870 --> 55:10.765
Look, it says here the tickets
went to some guy named Alex Hitchens.

55:10.871 --> 55:11.853
What?

55:22.870 --> 55:24.080
Machine.

55:27.318 --> 55:28.878
Hi, it's Sara.

55:32.086 --> 55:34.836
I just wanted to say thank you...

55:34.966 --> 55:39.473
for an unforgettable experience...

55:39.798 --> 55:40.878
the other day.

55:42.326 --> 55:44.627
And if you ever want to see
your shirt again...

55:44.726 --> 55:48.523
you can come by
the Fulton Fish Market tonight, around 8:00.

55:48.885 --> 55:50.773
Okay, bye.

55:54.197 --> 55:56.434
- Do you think he'll show?
- Yeah.

55:56.758 --> 55:59.475
He's too much of a player
to have a bad date on his record.

55:59.766 --> 56:02.515
Is this a source or a date?

56:03.670 --> 56:04.914
A source.

56:05.877 --> 56:07.470
Well, it sounded like a date.

56:08.470 --> 56:09.877
Well, it was supposed to.

56:12.918 --> 56:15.984
So it looks like a date
and it sounds like a date...

56:16.373 --> 56:19.340
- but it's not a date.
- Yeah. Right.

56:20.502 --> 56:21.614
Just checking.

56:40.981 --> 56:43.534
Hi. I wasn't sure you got my message.

56:43.733 --> 56:48.108
I wasn't sure you called the right guy.
You must be a glutton for punishment.

56:48.565 --> 56:51.085
Either that or I really wanna pay you back.

56:51.477 --> 56:53.266
I think this is yours.

56:54.164 --> 56:57.393
Thank you.
I'm gonna frame this for my wall of shame.

56:57.844 --> 56:59.819
Really? There's a whole wall?

57:00.084 --> 57:01.645
So what are we getting into?

57:04.053 --> 57:05.875
Ever been to a food rave before?

57:05.973 --> 57:09.748
Happens once a month, all around the city.
Different chefs, different venues.

57:09.940 --> 57:11.118
You any good in the kitchen?

57:11.252 --> 57:13.391
I can stand the heat,
if that's what you mean.

57:13.493 --> 57:17.137
Good. Because that's my boss
and his wife right over there.

57:17.397 --> 57:18.771
Interesting.

57:19.061 --> 57:22.770
Well, here's a concept:
We're paying to cook our own food.

57:22.901 --> 57:25.901
Here's another concept:
Shut up. It's an evening out.

57:26.004 --> 57:28.143
The longer you're married,
the less you go out.

57:28.244 --> 57:32.336
In a couple of years, we're gonna end up
bricked into our apartment like a Poe story.

57:33.300 --> 57:35.918
So, Louise, are you
in the newspaper business, also?

57:36.052 --> 57:37.328
No, I'm a psychiatrist.

57:38.740 --> 57:41.904
Well, that's the last thing
I'm gonna say tonight.

57:42.676 --> 57:46.058
So, Sara, you never told me.

57:46.324 --> 57:50.001
How was the Sky Studio fashion thing
you went to the other night?

57:50.132 --> 57:53.296
Did you meet anyone worth mentioning?

57:53.683 --> 57:54.698
No.

57:56.340 --> 57:59.886
Really? I find that very odd.

58:00.403 --> 58:02.607
- Max.
- I think you're being odd.

58:02.740 --> 58:06.056
Well, I'm always odd.
It's why you married me.

58:06.196 --> 58:08.236
And it's why I married you.

58:09.395 --> 58:10.857
Speaking of which, Hitch...

58:10.963 --> 58:14.640
what exactly are your intentions
for the lovely Sara?

58:14.772 --> 58:17.903
Wait, you know what?
Actually, there was someone.

58:20.275 --> 58:22.894
I think I met your friends Albert and Allegra.

58:23.699 --> 58:26.285
- My friends who and who?
- Allegra Cole?

58:26.419 --> 58:28.524
Really? How do you know her?

58:29.875 --> 58:32.046
- I don't.
- So you know Albert?

58:33.523 --> 58:35.498
- Knew.
- He had your tickets.

58:35.603 --> 58:38.899
I mean, how well do you really
know your accountant?

58:40.051 --> 58:43.761
April 15, and then you don't see him again
till April 15.

58:45.203 --> 58:46.447
Ladies and gentlemen...

58:46.547 --> 58:49.613
a coquille St. Jacques
with a lemon butter reduction.

58:49.811 --> 58:51.850
- Compliments of our chef.
- Thank you.

58:51.955 --> 58:53.930
I'm sure you're really gonna enjoy this.

59:01.555 --> 59:02.831
That's really good.

59:03.827 --> 59:05.867
I'm very impressed.

59:07.027 --> 59:08.009
Why is that?

59:09.010 --> 59:13.517
Around these two, people usually can't wait
to name-drop and dish their friends...

59:13.618 --> 59:15.080
and you're being all discreet.

59:15.186 --> 59:17.226
Yeah, it's quite endearing.

59:17.362 --> 59:20.046
Actually, it is.
So why don't we change the subject?

59:22.387 --> 59:25.289
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

59:26.066 --> 59:29.841
So Sara tells me
that you're a consultant, Hitch.

59:30.386 --> 59:34.958
Yeah, mostly marketing, little advertising,
brand management.

59:35.954 --> 59:38.158
I have no idea what that means.

59:38.322 --> 59:41.005
No one does.
That's why I get to charge so much.

59:45.010 --> 59:46.766
Are you sure you're all right?

59:47.442 --> 59:51.403
Yeah, I'm fine.
Is it itchy in here or is it just me?

59:52.082 --> 59:54.984
- I know what's happening.
- No.

59:55.410 --> 59:57.232
You think that I'm in a stressful state...

59:57.361 --> 59:59.434
because I'm trying to make
a good impression...

59:59.570 --> 01:00:02.603
while also dealing
with my commitment issues...

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:06.704
trying to avoid
all these awkward conversations.

01:00:07.282 --> 01:00:09.802
No, I think you have food allergies.

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:14.448
- Wow.
- What?

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:18.954
- Benadryl. Where's the Benadryl?
- Aisle 2.

01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:21.642
- Which one's Aisle 2?
- The one with the big 2 over it.

01:00:21.746 --> 01:00:23.240
Sara, I'm fine.

01:00:23.378 --> 01:00:25.418
- You sure it's in Aisle 2?
- No.

01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:27.528
Really, it is not that serious.

01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:32.685
Benadryl.

01:00:33.682 --> 01:00:36.780
- A lot of Benadryl. A lot.
- What? Are you...

01:00:50.705 --> 01:00:53.323
Coquille St. Jacques. Death on a leaf!

01:00:57.585 --> 01:00:58.633
Come on!

01:01:09.425 --> 01:01:11.148
Okay, we're doing fine.

01:01:11.249 --> 01:01:13.616
Just a couple more blocks
and you get to lie down.

01:01:22.193 --> 01:01:23.982
Wait, who sings that song again?

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.869
Oh, girl. Earth, Wind & Fire.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.756
You should let them sing it.

01:01:31.312 --> 01:01:34.891
I bet this would be great on the rocks.
It's good, right?

01:01:37.233 --> 01:01:40.080
I bet I can ask you
just about anything right now.

01:01:40.336 --> 01:01:41.318
No.

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:43.847
I'm a vault, baby. Locked down.

01:01:45.648 --> 01:01:48.910
What is an heiress doing with a CPA?

01:01:49.392 --> 01:01:51.050
They're going to the Knicks game.

01:01:51.697 --> 01:01:53.584
Yep, Fort Knox.

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.831
He loves her so much!

01:01:58.384 --> 01:01:59.845
I'm sure he does.

01:02:00.432 --> 01:02:04.589
I'm telling you, people search
their whole lives trying to find the...

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.502
Reasons that we're here

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:09.835
I wouldn't know.

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:12.174
You would if you saw it.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.975
Sometimes it's really hard
to see the forest through the sleaze.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.404
What about you? You ever been in love?

01:02:24.464 --> 01:02:25.543
Yep.

01:02:29.647 --> 01:02:31.338
But you're never gonna know that.

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:37.829
Okay, I think you've had enough
of the juice box.

01:02:40.431 --> 01:02:41.708
Let's go.

01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:50.057
This is some place.

01:02:51.343 --> 01:02:52.587
You live here alone?

01:02:54.352 --> 01:02:58.759
Yeah. I actually prefer it that way.
What about you?

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:03.499
I haven't had a roommate since college,
and he upped and married my sister.

01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:06.184
- Really?
- Yeah, they're gonna have a baby soon.

01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:08.110
Uncle Hitch.

01:03:09.711 --> 01:03:10.988
Thank you.

01:03:16.783 --> 01:03:19.598
- So, how do you feel?
- Good.

01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:22.121
Relaxed.

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.192
So what about you? Any siblings?

01:03:27.439 --> 01:03:31.149
Sister. Maria. Lives in D.C.

01:03:33.358 --> 01:03:34.820
Younger, right?

01:03:37.454 --> 01:03:38.981
I could hear it in your voice.

01:03:40.494 --> 01:03:43.811
Sort of an innate protective thing.

01:03:46.158 --> 01:03:47.587
Yeah, I guess.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:54.179
What?

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.667
She almost died once.

01:04:03.598 --> 01:04:04.711
I was 10.

01:04:13.262 --> 01:04:15.913
We were skating on the pond
behind our house...

01:04:16.334 --> 01:04:17.861
and she fell through the ice.

01:04:20.301 --> 01:04:21.643
My dad pulled her out.

01:04:25.742 --> 01:04:27.204
Gave her mouth-to-mouth.

01:04:30.798 --> 01:04:33.165
Longest three minutes of my life.

01:04:34.957 --> 01:04:36.419
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:04:42.414 --> 01:04:44.835
I don't think I've ever really gotten over it.

01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:51.560
Kind of defines you, doesn't it?

01:04:56.397 --> 01:05:00.772
You know like,
one moment you're gliding along...

01:05:02.093 --> 01:05:05.868
the next moment you're standing in the rain
watching your life fall apart.

01:05:07.853 --> 01:05:09.129
Except it was snow.

01:05:11.213 --> 01:05:13.668
Yeah. That's what I said, "snow."

01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:16.965
You said "rain."

01:05:19.053 --> 01:05:21.322
Some kind of precipitation.

01:05:25.932 --> 01:05:27.427
Is that what happened to you?

01:05:31.757 --> 01:05:34.953
Nothing as dramatic
as falling through the ice.

01:05:38.828 --> 01:05:40.454
You know...

01:05:41.773 --> 01:05:43.234
it definitely...

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.235
Left a scar?

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:51.492
Yeah.

01:06:03.661 --> 01:06:07.009
I guess it's best just not to love at all, right?

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.424
Or skate.

01:06:39.372 --> 01:06:40.779
Are you here?

01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:54.339
Sara, you're such an idiot! You moron!
What the hell did you think?

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:57.411
You're so stupid! You gotta learn, Sara.

01:06:57.547 --> 01:07:00.068
- When are you gonna learn...
- Should I come back later?

01:07:02.187 --> 01:07:05.503
Hi. I thought you left.

01:07:05.739 --> 01:07:10.147
Well, I did,
but then I came back with breakfast.

01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:14.085
I figured it was the least that I could do.

01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:18.080
I didn't know what you were drinking...

01:07:18.443 --> 01:07:22.983
so I got a grande cap, a latte,
an Earl Grey tea...

01:07:23.243 --> 01:07:25.316
and something with "chai" in the title.

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:28.388
Tea for me.

01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:31.109
Tea. Yes! I was hoping you'd say that.

01:07:33.962 --> 01:07:37.094
Oh, God.
You're a morning person, aren't you?

01:07:38.251 --> 01:07:41.350
Well, like I always tell my clients:

01:07:41.451 --> 01:07:44.320
Begin each day as if it were on purpose.

01:07:51.723 --> 01:07:53.730
- Wow. Beautiful day.
- Yeah.

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:57.705
- Beautiful girl.
- Thank you.

01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:01.352
Well, I'm this way.

01:08:01.802 --> 01:08:04.071
I'm that way.

01:08:05.323 --> 01:08:07.428
Give me a ring sometime.

01:08:09.258 --> 01:08:10.982
I mean, on the phone.

01:08:13.482 --> 01:08:16.002
No, I definitely will.

01:08:18.537 --> 01:08:19.618
Good.

01:08:47.721 --> 01:08:49.444
I gotta go to work.

01:08:58.826 --> 01:08:59.906
Bye.

01:09:02.377 --> 01:09:03.587
Goodbye.

01:09:27.368 --> 01:09:30.403
Can you believe what a beautiful day it is...

01:09:31.017 --> 01:09:32.228
not?

01:09:32.328 --> 01:09:35.328
- What's wrong, pumpkin?
- I'm so stupid.

01:09:35.977 --> 01:09:38.149
I ignored your advice. I went on that date.

01:09:38.249 --> 01:09:39.231
With who?

01:09:40.169 --> 01:09:41.696
Not the lingerie guy.

01:09:41.801 --> 01:09:45.029
Vance Munson. And you're right,
there's no way he ever had a mother.

01:09:45.161 --> 01:09:46.404
That bad?

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:50.721
He took me to Scalinatella,
and he was affectionate and sweet.

01:09:51.209 --> 01:09:54.470
He told me all these intimate things,
like how he can't taste food...

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:55.998
and he wants three kids.

01:09:56.137 --> 01:09:57.347
So you slept with him.

01:09:58.601 --> 01:10:00.510
I never seen anybody get dressed that fast.

01:10:00.617 --> 01:10:02.308
Case, I'm so sorry.

01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:07.334
- Maybe I'll just die alone after all.
- No, you won't.

01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:11.654
You'll meet a great guy with a great smile
and you'll travel the world together.

01:10:11.785 --> 01:10:13.824
Who are you? Where's my best friend?

01:10:13.928 --> 01:10:17.027
It's true. He just hasn't found you yet.
But he will.

01:10:17.128 --> 01:10:20.706
Just as he's leaving, guess what he says:
"Date Doctor, my ass."

01:10:20.808 --> 01:10:23.590
- What does that mean?
- It means he's really out there.

01:10:23.688 --> 01:10:27.398
And if I ever meet him, the only date
he's gonna need is with a real doctor.

01:10:39.528 --> 01:10:40.576
That's him.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.008
Vance, is that you?

01:10:43.688 --> 01:10:46.502
Yeah, hey there, beautiful.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.007
Sara Melas, from the Standard.

01:10:48.136 --> 01:10:50.502
I'd like to discuss
the dating consultant you hired...

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.673
before you went out with Casey Sedgewick.

01:10:56.071 --> 01:10:59.333
You don't wanna talk, that's fine.
I'm going to write this anyway.

01:10:59.432 --> 01:11:02.115
You just earned yourself a photo
with a boldface caption.

01:11:02.248 --> 01:11:03.622
What? Nice.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.331
I can only imagine how the trading
floor guys will react when they see this.

01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:09.089
You have no proof, no facts.

01:11:09.192 --> 01:11:11.810
Vance, I'm a gossip columnist, not the DA.

01:11:11.912 --> 01:11:14.562
Okay, how much will it cost me
to stay out of this?

01:11:14.696 --> 01:11:16.419
I don't want money. I want a name.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.756
- I don't know his name.
- Well, what do you know?

01:11:21.576 --> 01:11:22.917
I know this.

01:11:29.031 --> 01:11:31.006
All this for a lousy lay.

01:11:31.495 --> 01:11:32.739
Are we satisfied?

01:11:34.408 --> 01:11:35.553
Almost.

01:11:39.239 --> 01:11:42.021
No, you... You got to be...

01:11:47.655 --> 01:11:48.996
Is this really necessary?

01:11:49.607 --> 01:11:51.014
Have you seen your back?

01:11:51.111 --> 01:11:54.755
No, but I see my front and maybe
we should be starting with some sit-ups.

01:11:55.527 --> 01:11:57.088
God! Mother of Troy!

01:12:00.486 --> 01:12:01.631
Hello?

01:12:03.047 --> 01:12:06.691
That's crazy.
Just hearing your voice makes me smile.

01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:08.035
How are you?

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:10.239
I'm good, I think.

01:12:10.471 --> 01:12:13.853
No, actually, you know what?
I feel a little strange.

01:12:15.975 --> 01:12:17.219
I'm good.

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:19.876
Sweet Georgia Brown!

01:12:20.006 --> 01:12:21.086
What was that?

01:12:21.191 --> 01:12:24.125
No, that's just some guy screaming.

01:12:25.254 --> 01:12:27.010
Listen, is there any context...

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:31.998
under which you'd consider facial edema
and pharmaceutical intervention a date?

01:12:33.286 --> 01:12:34.660
Probably not.

01:12:34.758 --> 01:12:35.968
How about a do-over?

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:38.885
- What do you have in mind?
- Dinner, my place.

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:42.558
Because obviously going anywhere public
with you is out of the question.

01:12:43.462 --> 01:12:46.113
God! That's it. I don't like you very much.

01:12:46.214 --> 01:12:47.523
What is that?

01:12:47.654 --> 01:12:48.799
Wait, I'm getting up.

01:12:49.158 --> 01:12:51.460
It's like one of those makeover shows.

01:12:51.558 --> 01:12:53.566
- That's a makeover show?
- It's Danish.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:55.296
Almost done!

01:12:56.294 --> 01:12:57.439
Friday?

01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:02.209
Can't. I told a friend I'd go speed dating.
You know, for moral support.

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:03.964
But tomorrow I'm free.

01:13:05.286 --> 01:13:07.141
Great. All right, 8:00?

01:13:07.398 --> 01:13:08.346
Great.

01:13:08.486 --> 01:13:11.170
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:13:16.294 --> 01:13:19.360
- See, it wasn't so bad, was it?
- God!

01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:26.045
Ball is back in play
after a 20-second timeout.

01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:30.110
Knicks lead the Grizzlies, 12-6,
here early in the first quarter.

01:13:39.525 --> 01:13:41.980
- So this is what this feels like?
- "This" being?

01:13:42.597 --> 01:13:44.637
Great seats, great game.

01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:47.938
Great date.

01:13:50.053 --> 01:13:51.614
I mean, sort of.

01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:54.466
To me, it feels like a...

01:13:55.109 --> 01:13:57.051
- Date?
- Yeah.

01:14:02.693 --> 01:14:04.351
Look at her. She looks so happy.

01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:07.644
How does a guy like that end up
with a girl like her?

01:14:13.509 --> 01:14:16.575
I am so jealous.
I've always wanted to be able to do that.

01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:19.868
Really? Tonight is your lucky night.
Let's see what you got.

01:14:19.973 --> 01:14:21.566
Okay. You ready?

01:14:24.325 --> 01:14:27.456
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

01:14:27.557 --> 01:14:29.629
Knicks off to a great start...

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.194
All right, here's how it works.

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:35.360
Central Park Zoo, tomorrow, noon,
by the sea lions.

01:14:36.516 --> 01:14:38.076
No, don't worry. I'll find you.

01:14:38.596 --> 01:14:40.320
All right. Thank you.

01:14:58.148 --> 01:15:00.384
It's all right. I'm sorry.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.049
Damn me.

01:15:06.308 --> 01:15:08.610
That was it! You got it. Do it again.

01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:11.553
Look how cute they are.

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.748
Thanks.

01:15:58.467 --> 01:16:00.507
I had a great time tonight, Albert.

01:16:01.635 --> 01:16:04.221
I had a great time, too, Allegra.

01:16:24.099 --> 01:16:25.473
Good night.

01:16:25.954 --> 01:16:27.231
Good night, Albert.

01:16:40.354 --> 01:16:42.427
- Allegra.
- Yes?

01:16:46.466 --> 01:16:47.676
Hold on.

01:17:08.962 --> 01:17:10.555
I like your lips.

01:17:14.498 --> 01:17:16.124
They seem to like you, too.

01:17:24.257 --> 01:17:25.599
Good night.

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:27.551
Good night.

01:18:02.273 --> 01:18:04.378
- Anything?
- Not yet.

01:18:05.153 --> 01:18:07.542
But I got some great shots
of you biting your nails.

01:18:07.937 --> 01:18:09.246
Well, it's a big story.

01:18:11.138 --> 01:18:12.632
- Incoming.
- Really?

01:18:12.737 --> 01:18:13.981
Yep. They're shaking hands.

01:18:14.113 --> 01:18:16.350
This is so great. I can't wait to nail this guy.

01:18:16.481 --> 01:18:18.391
Make sure you get a good shot of his face.

01:18:18.497 --> 01:18:20.799
- What's he look like?
- Tall, dark, and handsome.

01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:22.488
Basic principles:

01:18:22.625 --> 01:18:24.894
No matter what, no matter who,
no matter when.

01:18:25.025 --> 01:18:26.651
This is killing me.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:28.378
Geoff is managing to play it straight.

01:18:28.513 --> 01:18:30.237
How long have you been in love with her?

01:18:30.337 --> 01:18:33.850
Her? About two-and-a-half years.

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:37.529
Take a look.

01:18:45.312 --> 01:18:48.346
- How'd you get my card?
- Albert Brennaman.

01:18:48.448 --> 01:18:50.391
- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.

01:18:52.705 --> 01:18:54.079
What? Sara.

01:19:00.097 --> 01:19:03.195
- Pleasure to meet you, Geoff.
- Hey, what...

01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:11.064
- How'd you get my card?
- Albert Brennaman.

01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:13.369
- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.

01:19:15.616 --> 01:19:17.110
You sure you want to do this?

01:19:17.824 --> 01:19:18.806
Why wouldn't I?

01:19:22.176 --> 01:19:26.454
Louise made an interesting observation
on the way home the other night.

01:19:27.552 --> 01:19:30.868
She said people who are guarded
are afraid...

01:19:31.872 --> 01:19:33.727
that you can see right through them.

01:19:33.855 --> 01:19:37.947
That's why they hide behind
layers of secrecy or humor.

01:19:38.143 --> 01:19:41.372
He'll have to hide behind a lot more
than that once this hits the fan.

01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:43.257
She meant you.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:49.758
What do you want me to say?

01:19:51.231 --> 01:19:55.225
That I like the guy?
Yeah, sure, I liked the guy.

01:19:56.895 --> 01:19:59.229
Well, here's his shirt.

01:20:01.216 --> 01:20:05.012
- Why don't you think about it? Call me.
- Thanks.

01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:18.490
Papi, Sara Melas is here to see you.

01:20:19.935 --> 01:20:22.869
Thanks a lot, Raoul. Send her up.
And stop calling me papi.

01:20:34.175 --> 01:20:37.339
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

01:20:38.591 --> 01:20:40.663
I believe this belongs to you.

01:20:44.703 --> 01:20:47.223
Yeah, this thing is like a bad penny.

01:20:47.326 --> 01:20:48.406
Wow!

01:20:49.503 --> 01:20:50.931
So this is it.

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.207
Yeah, this is it.

01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:56.797
Business must be good.

01:20:57.407 --> 01:20:59.895
Well, it has its rewards.

01:21:01.662 --> 01:21:02.938
I'll bet.

01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:05.627
Tough day?

01:21:06.655 --> 01:21:07.899
You could say that.

01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:12.310
Well, you know what?
You can just sit back and relax.

01:21:12.415 --> 01:21:14.171
I got this all covered.

01:21:17.215 --> 01:21:19.603
Spanish wine!

01:21:21.342 --> 01:21:23.863
How thoughtful are we?

01:21:23.966 --> 01:21:26.748
- Here, let me pour that for you.
- No, that's okay.

01:21:27.327 --> 01:21:29.945
- You want some?
- Sure.

01:21:31.646 --> 01:21:33.686
So, Hitch.

01:21:34.334 --> 01:21:37.596
Is that a noun or a verb?

01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:41.400
I guess it depends.

01:21:43.901 --> 01:21:47.546
Let's see, what should we toast to?

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:53.372
Never lie, steal, cheat, or drink.

01:21:54.334 --> 01:21:57.400
But if you must lie,
lie in the arms of the one you love.

01:21:58.301 --> 01:22:01.116
If you must steal,
steal away from bad company.

01:22:01.214 --> 01:22:03.864
If you must cheat, cheat death.

01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:06.042
And if you must drink...

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:09.688
drink in the moments
that take your breath away.

01:22:11.869 --> 01:22:13.364
Did you just make that up?

01:22:25.278 --> 01:22:26.619
Make yourself at home.

01:22:27.261 --> 01:22:29.497
I'm gonna check on the risotto.

01:22:31.165 --> 01:22:34.264
Look at this! Which one's the music?

01:22:41.277 --> 01:22:43.000
It does lights, too?

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:47.474
Let me help you out with that.

01:22:47.613 --> 01:22:50.166
Now, this is nifty.

01:22:51.741 --> 01:22:52.985
What are you doing?

01:22:53.437 --> 01:22:55.444
How does it work, exactly?

01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:01.723
Well, usually you have dinner,
then you have dessert.

01:23:02.557 --> 01:23:05.786
No, I mean your thriving business.

01:23:10.045 --> 01:23:11.387
I don't do interviews.

01:23:13.244 --> 01:23:16.822
But if you'd like to get back to the evening,
I'd be happy to sit and talk.

01:23:16.924 --> 01:23:18.779
Great idea. You start.

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:24.371
Well, maybe I would if you weren't snarling.

01:23:30.684 --> 01:23:32.571
What if I told you...

01:23:32.668 --> 01:23:37.403
that I know exactly what you do
and how you do it?

01:23:37.533 --> 01:23:39.355
And I think it's despicable!

01:23:39.453 --> 01:23:42.169
You know what?
We might need to go out to dinner.

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.715
There's a great seafood restaurant
I'd love to take you to.

01:23:47.676 --> 01:23:49.716
How about you just get a cleaver, butcher?

01:23:50.236 --> 01:23:53.083
- Maybe I will!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:23:53.212 --> 01:23:54.968
Nothing a front-page story can't cure.

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.442
So that's what this is all about?

01:23:56.572 --> 01:23:59.255
Albert and Allegra
on the front of your crap-ass newspaper?

01:23:59.356 --> 01:24:01.080
- You put them there!
- No, you did!

01:24:01.212 --> 01:24:03.765
No, he did! The minute he called you!

01:24:30.203 --> 01:24:32.178
Dr. Hitch. Listen to me, papi.

01:24:32.283 --> 01:24:36.113
I need to bring my partner, Amir,
somewhere amazing for our anniversary.

01:24:36.763 --> 01:24:39.545
Maybe it's not your thing, but maybe it is.

01:24:39.643 --> 01:24:41.530
What the hell are you talking about, Raoul?

01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:43.088
It's you, no?

01:25:02.778 --> 01:25:06.575
So, my friend, how was she? Pretty good?

01:25:10.523 --> 01:25:12.912
How was she? I'll tell you! She was great!

01:25:26.811 --> 01:25:28.021
Isn't that the Date Doctor?

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:31.122
- I'm telling you, that's him.
- He doesn't look anything like him.

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:33.779
- Excuse me. Do you know him?
- No.

01:25:34.235 --> 01:25:37.682
I want you to look me in the eye
and tell me that he did not hire you.

01:25:37.818 --> 01:25:41.463
Ma'am, I have never seen this man
before in my life.

01:25:41.562 --> 01:25:42.577
See you later, Tony.

01:25:42.683 --> 01:25:45.170
Tony? You have got
some serious explaining to do.

01:25:45.274 --> 01:25:47.161
Albert. Hitch. You all right?

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:49.973
I can't really talk right now.
I'm kind of tied up.

01:25:50.074 --> 01:25:51.961
One, two. On three.

01:25:59.674 --> 01:26:01.462
Women will remain seated.

01:26:01.562 --> 01:26:04.595
Men will rotate to the left at the buzzer.

01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:06.832
You get two minutes each,
four minutes total.

01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:10.385
So trade your talk time when you hear...

01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:13.715
the gong.

01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:15.672
If it's mutual, you get numbers.

01:26:15.802 --> 01:26:19.151
If not, better luck next time, okay?

01:26:19.994 --> 01:26:22.360
Ladies, take your seats.

01:26:23.673 --> 01:26:28.146
Case, you are a living testimonial
to the triumph of hope over experience.

01:26:28.281 --> 01:26:29.394
Thanks for coming.

01:26:29.529 --> 01:26:32.595
I know it's lame. I'm sure it's the last thing
you feel like doing.

01:26:32.857 --> 01:26:36.654
I really prefer Rachmaninoff
to the heavier romantic composers.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:39.760
But despite the pan-Germanic
anti-Semitism...

01:26:39.865 --> 01:26:42.833
I'd still have to say my favorite is Wagner.

01:26:45.082 --> 01:26:47.471
- Nice talking to you.
- Thank you. Bye.

01:26:47.610 --> 01:26:48.624
Bye.

01:26:50.425 --> 01:26:51.636
Excuse me.

01:26:52.185 --> 01:26:53.712
That's my seat, man.

01:26:55.769 --> 01:26:57.678
My name is Ron. I'm 28.

01:26:57.785 --> 01:27:00.206
Albert Brennaman is a good man.

01:27:00.345 --> 01:27:02.995
In fact, Albert Brennaman is a great man.

01:27:03.129 --> 01:27:05.714
I just got out of a five-year relationship.

01:27:05.849 --> 01:27:08.599
I'm a lot of fun at parties. I like dogs...

01:27:08.729 --> 01:27:11.282
And then you're mad at me
for what I do for a living?

01:27:11.385 --> 01:27:12.694
I've already got your number...

01:27:12.793 --> 01:27:15.280
so why don't you go
consult your conscience?

01:27:15.385 --> 01:27:18.036
- Albert is in love with her.
- Just like Sebastian?

01:27:18.169 --> 01:27:19.991
- Is there a problem?
- No, just one sec.

01:27:20.121 --> 01:27:22.771
- What do you have against Allegra anyway?
- Nothing.

01:27:22.873 --> 01:27:25.840
My interest is protecting women
from assholes like you.

01:27:25.945 --> 01:27:27.570
I did ice climbing once.

01:27:27.673 --> 01:27:29.877
- You don't even know me.
- And whose fault is that?

01:27:30.008 --> 01:27:32.692
...the sun comes up,
the ice really starts to fall apart.

01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:33.970
I bet. I'm sorry.

01:27:34.073 --> 01:27:36.080
- Do you know this guy?
- Apparently not.

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:37.745
You're in my seat.

01:27:37.881 --> 01:27:41.230
You really...
I'm doing you a favor, believe me.

01:27:41.369 --> 01:27:45.330
Basically, I like outdoor sports.
But indoor sports have their place, too.

01:27:45.432 --> 01:27:47.985
There are certain aspects of my job
that are secretive.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.160
And my job is to try to find the truth.

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:53.744
The truth? You wouldn't know the truth
if it kicked you in the head.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.368
If Albert Brennaman has to take a fall for it,
so be it.

01:27:56.472 --> 01:27:58.611
Why don't you say
what's really pissing you off?

01:27:58.712 --> 01:28:00.141
I've been waiting to talk to her...

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.647
- You want to sit down? Here you go. Gong!
- Thank you.

01:28:02.744 --> 01:28:03.758
Excuse me.

01:28:03.864 --> 01:28:06.798
Hi. Actually, you're not supposed to move.

01:28:06.904 --> 01:28:09.555
I'm Alex Hitchens. No, it's okay. Go.

01:28:09.688 --> 01:28:11.182
- I'm Casey.
- Hi, Casey.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.167
I work for a small publishing house
in the press department...

01:28:14.263 --> 01:28:17.198
which isn't actually where I want to be.
But it's a good house...

01:28:17.304 --> 01:28:19.759
You handled me. You manipulated me.

01:28:19.864 --> 01:28:23.344
You researched me and you showed me
my great-grandfather's signature.

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:25.519
Wait. You're Ellis Island?

01:28:25.624 --> 01:28:27.446
- I thought that was real sweet.
- Thank you.

01:28:27.544 --> 01:28:29.137
Case, you're not helping.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.800
Excuse me, I'm on a date.

01:28:32.088 --> 01:28:35.601
Does it ever occur to women
that maybe a guy might like to have a plan...

01:28:35.703 --> 01:28:37.110
because he's nervous?

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:41.037
He's not sure that he could just
walk up to you and you'd respond if he said:

01:28:41.143 --> 01:28:42.550
"I like you."

01:28:46.807 --> 01:28:49.774
- That sounds good to me.
- True, you can't tell them you like them.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.946
- I tried that. It didn't go well.
- I've crashed and burned on that.

01:28:53.079 --> 01:28:55.632
That is what you did, and I did like you!

01:28:55.767 --> 01:28:58.669
I just didn't know I was being worked over
by some professional.

01:28:58.775 --> 01:29:00.084
He doesn't have a badge.

01:29:00.727 --> 01:29:02.669
The only time he was sincere
or spontaneous...

01:29:02.807 --> 01:29:06.452
was when everything was going wrong
or when you were stoned out of your head.

01:29:06.551 --> 01:29:09.715
- I'm sorry to interrupt. Do I know you?
- No, I don't think so.

01:29:09.847 --> 01:29:12.596
- You wanna see me be spontaneous?
- Sure, you want a Benadryl?

01:29:12.727 --> 01:29:17.102
This is really kind of distracting.
And I haven't gotten laid in a year!

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.907
We're sorry.
Why don't you guys get back to your date?

01:29:26.743 --> 01:29:29.012
Or go somewhere.

01:29:30.039 --> 01:29:31.217
Maybe from the bank?

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:35.410
If this doesn't work out, call him.
He might hook you up with Paris Hilton.

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:38.707
Wait, that's it. You're the Date Doctor, right?

01:29:43.158 --> 01:29:46.006
- You're the Date Doctor?
- Do we have a problem here?

01:29:46.103 --> 01:29:50.510
Yeah, a big one!
What the hell did I ever do to you?

01:29:52.406 --> 01:29:53.748
Am I missing something?

01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:56.205
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:29:56.502 --> 01:29:59.023
Why don't you go hit a titty bar
with your buddy Vance?

01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:05.677
Wow.

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:08.655
I don't believe this.

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:13.459
That's your source?

01:30:14.326 --> 01:30:15.787
You buried yourself, Alex.

01:30:16.438 --> 01:30:18.031
Then you weren't listening.

01:30:18.166 --> 01:30:20.271
I heard every word.

01:30:20.758 --> 01:30:22.318
You're a scam artist.

01:30:22.422 --> 01:30:25.837
- You trick women into getting...
- Into getting out of their own way...

01:30:25.942 --> 01:30:29.237
so great guys like Albert Brennaman
have a fighting chance.

01:30:29.366 --> 01:30:32.749
No, I want everybody
to take a good look at this right now.

01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:34.293
Because this right here...

01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:38.219
this is exactly why falling in love
is so goddamn hard.

01:30:39.637 --> 01:30:41.492
Sir, let's go. Now.

01:30:44.406 --> 01:30:46.740
And Vance Munson is a pig!

01:30:46.838 --> 01:30:49.074
And I refused to work with him.

01:30:49.781 --> 01:30:51.439
You need to get your facts right.

01:30:53.621 --> 01:30:56.588
It's because of jerks like him
that I even have a job.

01:30:59.509 --> 01:31:00.786
Had a job.

01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:14.484
Can you believe that guy?

01:31:15.701 --> 01:31:18.221
Actually, I do.

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:39.918
You...

01:31:41.524 --> 01:31:43.248
complete me.

01:31:44.725 --> 01:31:47.026
- I might just have...
- Shut up.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.107
Just shut up.

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:51.946
You had me at "hello."

01:32:18.964 --> 01:32:20.273
No comment.

01:32:24.628 --> 01:32:28.425
This is off the record.

01:32:33.524 --> 01:32:35.247
I came to apologize.

01:32:35.476 --> 01:32:37.865
I made some assumptions about you...

01:32:38.004 --> 01:32:40.754
based on nothing, it turns out.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:47.152
- I guess Casey's right. My best friend...
- Don't worry about it. We're straight.

01:32:48.404 --> 01:32:52.266
I should've asked you.
But sometimes you're so guarded.

01:32:52.404 --> 01:32:55.666
I just don't wanna be another reason
for you to...

01:32:56.659 --> 01:33:00.620
I'm not someone who likes to get involved
past a certain point.

01:33:00.788 --> 01:33:04.432
And that point was about a week ago.

01:33:10.259 --> 01:33:14.667
Well, I just want to say I'm really sorry...

01:33:16.179 --> 01:33:17.673
and I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:33:20.147 --> 01:33:21.488
You didn't.

01:33:25.459 --> 01:33:26.636
That's a relief.

01:33:54.514 --> 01:33:57.329
- Hey, fella.
- Yeah, good. You?

01:33:59.891 --> 01:34:01.036
What you got there?

01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:05.643
This? I figured maybe if my heart
stops beating, it wouldn't hurt so much.

01:34:07.123 --> 01:34:08.367
She hasn't called back?

01:34:12.627 --> 01:34:13.903
You want some coffee?

01:34:19.122 --> 01:34:20.267
I want you to fix it.

01:34:24.722 --> 01:34:25.932
I got nothing, Albert.

01:34:27.922 --> 01:34:30.256
You wanna do something?
We should get out tonight.

01:34:30.354 --> 01:34:33.289
Honestly, I never knew I could feel like this.

01:34:33.394 --> 01:34:35.882
I swear I'm going out of my mind.

01:34:37.362 --> 01:34:39.696
I wanna throw myself off
of every building in New York.

01:34:39.794 --> 01:34:44.104
I see a cab and I wanna dive in front of it,
because then I'll stop thinking about her.

01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:46.828
Look, you will. Just give it time.

01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:49.199
That's just it. I don't want to.

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:52.617
I've waited my whole life
to feel this miserable.

01:34:52.786 --> 01:34:55.371
If this is the only way
I can stay connected with her...

01:34:55.474 --> 01:34:56.968
then this is who I have to be.

01:34:57.105 --> 01:35:01.033
No, you don't.
You can change, you can adapt.

01:35:01.649 --> 01:35:04.235
You can make it
so you don't ever have to feel like this.

01:35:04.337 --> 01:35:05.286
Ever again.

01:35:15.345 --> 01:35:17.417
Oh, my God. You just don't get it, do you?

01:35:18.385 --> 01:35:19.629
I get it.

01:35:21.073 --> 01:35:22.415
Let me get this straight.

01:35:22.577 --> 01:35:25.708
You're selling this stuff,
but you don't believe in your own product.

01:35:26.002 --> 01:35:28.685
- Love is my life.
- No. Love is your job.

01:35:41.937 --> 01:35:44.358
You wanna jump out a plane
without a chute, be my guest.

01:35:44.465 --> 01:35:46.439
But forgive me if I don't join you.

01:35:47.632 --> 01:35:49.738
This isn't about love for you at all, is it?

01:35:53.201 --> 01:35:55.273
This whole time, I thought I was the coward.

01:36:00.145 --> 01:36:02.152
- Where you going?
- Skydiving.

01:36:31.985 --> 01:36:33.130
Taxi!

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:06.764
Mr. Hitchens.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.964
Miss Cole,
thank you very much for seeing me.

01:37:10.064 --> 01:37:12.104
You said it was a matter of life and death.

01:37:13.552 --> 01:37:16.650
That man would've sold his soul
to make you happy.

01:37:17.007 --> 01:37:19.593
So what does that make you, the devil?

01:37:21.935 --> 01:37:26.540
My job is not to deceive, Miss Cole.
It's to create opportunities.

01:37:27.887 --> 01:37:28.967
Like the boardroom.

01:37:29.711 --> 01:37:31.686
- Would you have noticed him otherwise?
- Yes.

01:37:31.791 --> 01:37:33.930
- Really?
- Eventually.

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:39.334
Maybe.

01:37:42.959 --> 01:37:44.999
How did you know all that stuff about me?

01:37:47.567 --> 01:37:49.291
Well, you really did your homework.

01:37:51.183 --> 01:37:54.892
Like at boarding school when everyone
used to tease me because I couldn't whistle.

01:37:55.311 --> 01:37:58.606
And having him dance like a buffoon
knowing that I can't dance, either.

01:37:59.279 --> 01:38:03.076
Then telling him to drop mustard
on his shirt, so I'd feel less like a dork.

01:38:06.574 --> 01:38:08.549
That was all you, right?

01:38:09.167 --> 01:38:11.436
No. Hell, no.

01:38:11.726 --> 01:38:12.773
That was him?

01:38:13.198 --> 01:38:15.271
That's got Albert written all over it.

01:38:17.071 --> 01:38:18.762
Did you put him up to the inhaler?

01:38:19.214 --> 01:38:21.319
Stop it. He did not show you that.

01:38:22.671 --> 01:38:24.613
He chucked it right before he kissed me.

01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:26.474
So, wait...

01:38:27.246 --> 01:38:29.221
that stuff worked for you?

01:38:31.279 --> 01:38:32.588
It was adorable.

01:38:40.078 --> 01:38:41.354
What did you do?

01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:44.808
Nothing.

01:38:49.902 --> 01:38:51.593
Absolutely nothing.

01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:54.888
That's good.

01:38:56.782 --> 01:38:59.237
- This was your plan the whole time?
- Albert.

01:38:59.342 --> 01:39:01.382
You sail off into the sunset with my girl?

01:39:06.062 --> 01:39:09.891
You were like a brother to me!

01:39:10.766 --> 01:39:13.384
- He came here for you.
- Who?

01:39:13.486 --> 01:39:14.762
The guy you're choking.

01:39:25.934 --> 01:39:27.974
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:39:28.077 --> 01:39:29.801
I really love you.

01:39:33.262 --> 01:39:36.131
- I love you more.
- I love you more. I really do.

01:39:38.765 --> 01:39:40.140
I got somewhere I gotta go.

01:40:10.285 --> 01:40:12.489
- Yeah, who is it?
- Hitch.

01:40:13.965 --> 01:40:14.979
Can I talk to you?

01:40:23.148 --> 01:40:24.076
What?

01:40:26.444 --> 01:40:27.557
You almost hit me.

01:40:31.884 --> 01:40:36.040
Look, I just wanted to stop by, basically.

01:40:37.612 --> 01:40:38.856
See, this is the thing.

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:47.874
This is weird.
I don't have me behind the door, you know.

01:40:48.972 --> 01:40:49.987
Close your mouth.

01:40:53.196 --> 01:40:56.295
Because I knew at some point I'd be...

01:40:57.932 --> 01:41:01.445
right here. But I thought that...

01:41:06.188 --> 01:41:09.058
everything would come out, but it's like...

01:41:10.604 --> 01:41:11.848
That's throwing me off.

01:41:17.196 --> 01:41:19.465
- Can we close the door?
- What?

01:41:19.564 --> 01:41:22.880
I'm sorry. Just, can we... I just need...

01:41:23.019 --> 01:41:25.834
- Are you serious?
- No, just like this.

01:41:29.772 --> 01:41:31.365
What do you want, Hitch?

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:34.369
You.

01:41:37.356 --> 01:41:41.033
For a whole lot of reasons
that don't make any sense to me.

01:41:42.252 --> 01:41:45.415
I mean, what, we've been on three dates?

01:41:46.219 --> 01:41:48.161
See, that's what's crazy.

01:41:48.331 --> 01:41:50.916
That's what's crazy, because I know.

01:41:51.275 --> 01:41:52.552
I know deep...

01:41:52.651 --> 01:41:57.321
like just down, just in this area...

01:41:58.091 --> 01:41:59.978
that I just know...

01:42:01.516 --> 01:42:02.977
that I want...

01:42:03.723 --> 01:42:07.651
I want to be miserable.

01:42:07.755 --> 01:42:10.438
Like, really miserable.

01:42:10.955 --> 01:42:12.068
Because, hey...

01:42:12.171 --> 01:42:16.546
if that's what it takes
for me to be happy then...

01:42:18.698 --> 01:42:20.454
Wait, that didn't come out right.

01:42:20.555 --> 01:42:22.792
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:25.640
- Nothing!
- No, not you.

01:42:27.211 --> 01:42:29.066
I'm talking to me.

01:42:49.322 --> 01:42:51.231
Alex Hitchens, Tom Reda.

01:42:55.594 --> 01:42:57.088
I'll just put this in the car.

01:43:10.698 --> 01:43:12.323
Maybe it's like what you said.

01:43:12.554 --> 01:43:16.483
We should just both go our separate ways
and then we'll do just fine.

01:43:27.721 --> 01:43:29.314
What if fine isn't good enough?

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:36.001
What if I want extraordinary?

01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:38.402
No such thing.

01:43:50.409 --> 01:43:52.416
I'm just as scared as you are, Sara.

01:43:53.162 --> 01:43:56.096
But I'm right here, and our time is right now.

01:43:56.554 --> 01:43:57.983
Well, what about before?

01:43:58.089 --> 01:44:01.253
I am a guy. Since when
do we get anything right the first time?

01:44:01.354 --> 01:44:03.720
I'm a realist,
and I know what love does to people.

01:44:04.201 --> 01:44:05.761
- No, you don't.
- Keys.

01:44:07.849 --> 01:44:10.216
There you go. Right here.

01:44:13.257 --> 01:44:15.908
I don't know who this is, and I don't care.

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:20.774
What I do know is he'll never feel about you
the way that I do.

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.793
- You know how to drive a stick?
- Both of you, shut up!

01:44:32.488 --> 01:44:34.877
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

01:44:35.849 --> 01:44:37.856
You'll never be fine, and neither will I!

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:42.436
Maybe I should drive.

01:44:43.497 --> 01:44:45.569
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

01:44:45.736 --> 01:44:47.111
If that's what it takes.

01:44:47.208 --> 01:44:48.550
Sara, what happened?

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:51.038
- He jumped on the car.
- Why?

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.345
Because that's what people do.

01:44:54.249 --> 01:44:57.478
They leap and hope to God they can fly.

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.258
Because otherwise...

01:45:05.321 --> 01:45:07.742
we just drop like a rock...

01:45:08.392 --> 01:45:10.148
wondering the whole way down:

01:45:11.081 --> 01:45:14.429
"Why in the hell did I jump?"

01:45:16.137 --> 01:45:19.649
But here I am, Sara, falling.

01:45:20.584 --> 01:45:24.545
And there's only one person
that makes me feel like I can fly.

01:45:26.856 --> 01:45:27.968
That's you.

01:45:33.096 --> 01:45:35.616
So, you kind of like me?

01:45:36.648 --> 01:45:37.695
No.

01:45:38.824 --> 01:45:39.937
I love you.

01:45:41.255 --> 01:45:43.492
I love you, and I knew it from the first...

01:45:53.703 --> 01:45:56.289
If I say it back now, it'll sound so stupid.

01:45:59.336 --> 01:46:03.362
This is the guy I was telling you about.
Hitch, that's my sister, Maria.

01:46:03.464 --> 01:46:05.187
And that's her husband, Tom.

01:46:09.544 --> 01:46:10.754
Her husband.

01:46:50.823 --> 01:46:52.230
Where's your date?

01:46:52.775 --> 01:46:54.236
Don't have one.

01:46:59.878 --> 01:47:01.536
I know. Shocking, huh?

01:47:04.903 --> 01:47:07.521
