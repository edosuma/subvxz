00:44.844 --> 00:49.178
Brandon, what did you do
to my room? Hey.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.844
Hi, Bren.

00:54.487 --> 00:55.647
Where are my things?

00:57.190 --> 00:59.954
- What?
- How could you do this to me?

01:01.661 --> 01:03.288
Do what?

01:05.598 --> 01:06.690
What's going on here?

01:06.866 --> 01:08.390
That's what I wanna know.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.559
How did you get here?

01:10.737 --> 01:12.034
I walked.

01:12.205 --> 01:14.173
Now, can you please get
your stuff out of my room?

01:14.340 --> 01:16.035
Brandon, are you all right?

01:18.878 --> 01:19.902
Brenda?

01:21.347 --> 01:23.008
Hi.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.377
What are you doing here?

01:24.551 --> 01:26.576
You're supposed to be in school.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.879
In Minnesota.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.754
I dropped out.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.740
<i>What?</i>

04:49.622 --> 04:50.884
Can you believe this madhouse?

04:51.057 --> 04:52.649
Yeah, the whole day started crazy.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.487
- What happened?
- Brenda came home.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.994
- What about Minnesota?
- You know as much as I do.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.325
Oh, miss, I'm sorry.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.731
The Communications Theory course
you've requested's already filled up.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.370
But I'm a Journalism major.

05:05.538 --> 05:06.596
You're also a freshman.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.471
David, what happened?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.670
I got shut out of practically
every course I wanted.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.405
You got any advice?

05:16.582 --> 05:19.016
Yeah, tell them
you're a sophomore.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.614
Brenda's back?
But I talked to her there.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.690
- She said everything was terrific.
- Well, apparently not.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.520
Wow, I gotta tell Kelly.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.323
Wait a second. Hold on.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.464
When were we told
about a math placement test?

05:32.632 --> 05:34.998
It was in your freshman
orientation packet.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.260
If you'd read it.

05:37.136 --> 05:40.628
Now, please, just pick an alternate
Geology course and we're finished.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.469
Geology? Oh, joy.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.008
Do you have anything
like Rocks for Jocks?

05:51.384 --> 05:53.318
Thank you.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.647
What do you mean you're not
going out for the newspaper?

05:55.822 --> 05:56.846
I've done the newspaper.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.423
<i>The Condor is a real daily.
They're interviewing today.</i>

05:59.592 --> 06:01.924
- We should go there right now.
- Easy for you, Einstein.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.222
You don't have to take
the math placement test like us.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.093
- I'll wait for you.
- Really, you don't have to.

06:07.266 --> 06:10.394
<i>How can you just blow this off?
We were the best at the Blaze.</i>

06:10.570 --> 06:12.970
Andrea, in case you haven't noticed,
the freshmen around here

06:13.139 --> 06:15.607
get the rubber end of the plunger,
if you know what I'm saying.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.140
<i>The Condor will just be grunt work.</i>

06:17.310 --> 06:19.335
Besides, I got a lot of things
on my mind right now.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.776
- Yeah, like what?
- Like I have a major housing crisis.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.280
I don't have a dorm, an apartment,
I don't have anything.

06:24.450 --> 06:25.712
When I agreed to live at home,

06:25.885 --> 06:27.284
Brenda was not sleeping
on my futon.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.683
What's up with her? I mean,
did she really hate it there?

06:29.856 --> 06:31.255
Your guess is as good as mine.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.655
All I know is she showed up
at the foot of my bed this morning.

06:35.294 --> 06:39.321
<i>Listen, if you wanna go
be on The Condor, go for it.</i>

06:39.565 --> 06:42.796
Well, I thought I'd just give it
that old college try.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.467
Good luck, chief.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.731
You will never believe this.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.968
Now I've gotta stand
in this huge fee-payment line.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.237
Mel really messed up.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.041
But after my math test, we can go
straight to the radio station.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.910
Oh, I don't know.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.712
Donna, if we're serious
about getting on-air positions here,

07:00.887 --> 07:02.218
we have to kick in some doors.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.219
But I have to call Brenda.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.649
- Later.
- Later?

07:14.267 --> 07:17.464
- Hey, what classes did you get?
- I didn't get any.

07:17.637 --> 07:18.865
What were your backup choices?

07:19.038 --> 07:20.130
There weren't any, Kel.

07:20.306 --> 07:22.501
I couldn't stand in that line
for another second.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.472
So you're not gonna register
at all?

07:24.644 --> 07:25.906
I can't stand this place.

07:26.078 --> 07:29.104
What do you want from me?
It's like a zoo in there. I'm leaving.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.216
Dylan, you gotta give it a chance.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.113
No, I don't.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.151
I'll call you later.

07:41.260 --> 07:44.855
- Hello.
- So it's true, you really are back.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.931
<i>- Yeah.
- What happened?</i>

07:49.869 --> 07:51.598
Look, let me call you later, okay?

07:51.771 --> 07:53.033
Okay, are you all right?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.572
Great. I just can't talk right now.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.971
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.477
So where were we?

08:02.648 --> 08:05.742
You were telling us why you left.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.851
I thought I already did.

08:08.020 --> 08:12.582
No, what you said was
it felt all wrong.

08:12.758 --> 08:16.091
We were hoping
for a few specifics.

08:17.396 --> 08:19.489
Honey, just talk to us.

08:19.665 --> 08:23.123
I mean, it's very difficult for us
to understand what's going on here.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.361
What's going on
is I didn't like my classes,

08:25.538 --> 08:28.200
I didn't like the dorm,
I didn't like the people.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.069
I didn't like anything.

08:30.776 --> 08:33.904
Aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln,
how did you enjoy the play?

08:34.313 --> 08:37.611
Brenda, if you'd just told us
there was a problem,

08:37.783 --> 08:40.115
I'm sure we could have dealt
with it.

08:40.285 --> 08:42.254
There was nothing you could do.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.321
I thought that you guys would be
happy to see me.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.185
Instead, you're giving me
the third degree.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.849
I'm sorry, it's such a problem
for you.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.291
Well, it's not just us.
I mean, what about Brandon?

08:50.463 --> 08:52.658
Now with you home, going
to California University,

08:52.832 --> 08:55.232
Brandon's talking
about moving out.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.371
Who said anything
about me going to CU?

09:01.340 --> 09:02.864
Wait a second,
what are you saying?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.669
Well, I think the one thing
that's obvious

09:04.844 --> 09:07.608
from this whole experience
is that I'm not meant for college.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.181
Brenda, you're going to college.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.942
Tell her that she's going
to college.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.213
Honey, you just panicked.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.586
Mom, you call it panic, I call it
getting in touch with myself.

09:20.426 --> 09:23.361
Look, I knew I made a mistake.
If I'd waited another day,

09:23.529 --> 09:25.793
you only would have gotten
75 percent of my tuition back.

09:25.965 --> 09:29.059
- At least this way, you got 90.
- My bank account thanks you.

09:29.235 --> 09:33.433
Brenda, you are going to school.
Somewhere.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.073
I don't think so, Dad.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.868
Now, I have to unpack.
Can we talk about this later?

09:38.044 --> 09:39.944
Brenda, you made a commitment.

09:40.112 --> 09:43.809
Grandma says I shouldn't be
afraid to change my mind.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.281
To me, those are words
to live by.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.618
I love your mother.

10:18.684 --> 10:21.619
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

10:23.089 --> 10:25.387
Don't try to cheat off me.

10:26.759 --> 10:30.957
I'm not trying to cheat off you.
I'm trying to cheat off him.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.557
Why?

10:33.733 --> 10:35.701
You know math isn't
my strong suit.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.768
Steve, you're not being graded
on this.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.270
It's a placement test.
Do you understand?

10:41.741 --> 10:43.333
Yeah.

10:45.745 --> 10:49.010
My name is Josh Richland.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.672
<i>I'm the managing editor
of The Condor, and I've been told</i>

10:51.851 --> 10:56.788
I have a low threshold
for stupidity, so listen carefully.

10:56.956 --> 11:00.119
<i>The Condor is committed
to professional standards</i>

11:00.292 --> 11:02.260
and professional ethics.

11:02.428 --> 11:05.192
The weak need not apply.

11:05.364 --> 11:08.333
Now, you may think
you're the hottest thing

11:08.501 --> 11:09.900
to walk into this newsroom,

11:10.069 --> 11:14.733
but to me, all you are
are freshmen.

11:14.907 --> 11:18.570
Little fish in a relatively big pond.

11:19.111 --> 11:22.547
The cards you are receiving contain
your audition writing assignments.

11:22.715 --> 11:26.583
Your deadline is 5 p. m. Tomorrow.

11:27.319 --> 11:31.779
What if we have placement tests
tomorrow and can't complete it?

11:33.259 --> 11:35.557
What if a giant cow fell
on your flat head?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.388
Figure it out.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.225
Goodbye, people.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.828
Excuse me, Mr. Richland?

11:47.006 --> 11:48.371
Yeah, what is it?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.941
I can't do
this particular assignment.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.805
I think that it's a conflict
of interest.

11:52.978 --> 11:57.540
Oh, please, it's just a test to see
what kind of a writer you are.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.184
You are a writer, aren't you?

11:59.351 --> 12:02.411
- I'd like to think so.
- Good.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.154
It's so simple. It's so simple.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.888
Bro, I hear you lost
your love shack.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.931
Well, news travels fast
around here.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.592
Maybe you should consider
a fraternity.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.965
Steve, the return of Brenda Walsh
is still not enough

12:20.139 --> 12:21.800
to drive me into a frat.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.909
Wait a second,
this is not just any frat, okay?

12:25.077 --> 12:28.513
This is Kappa Epsilon Gamma House.
The K.E.G. House.

12:28.681 --> 12:29.807
I can make it happen for you.

12:29.982 --> 12:31.916
Yeah, I know you can,
but I'm not an up-all-night,

12:32.084 --> 12:34.552
drinking-beer-out-of-a-keg,
eating-cold-pizza-for-breakfast,

12:34.720 --> 12:37.052
getting-hit-in-the-back-of-the-head-
with-a-cricket-bat guy.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.088
No, you're just some kind
of soft-drink-sipping,

12:39.258 --> 12:41.818
hockey-puck-haircut-having,
Bart Simpson look-alike.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.928
Without a place to live, though.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.530
Now, when we find
the station's program director,

12:46.699 --> 12:49.429
remember, the first impression
may be the only chance we get.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.933
- How's my hair look?
- Looks fine.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.365
You didn't even look.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.371
Donna, hair doesn't matter
in radio.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.909
Oh, would you look at this place?
This is so cool.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.409
Oh, I'm so nervous.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.912
Well, just relax.
Let me do all the talking.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.613
Mr. Program Director?

13:07.686 --> 13:09.620
Don't touch that dial
because standing before you

13:09.789 --> 13:12.383
is the number-one morning team
from WBH, Beverly Hills.

13:12.558 --> 13:13.820
The double D's, David and Donna.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.019
The rockingest jocks
with the most pulsating patter.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.861
Or the most refined commentary
and classical stylings,

13:22.034 --> 13:23.524
if that's what it takes.

13:26.071 --> 13:30.974
Or we just won't talk at all,
we'll just play music and shut up.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.779
You're looking
for the Financial Aid Department?

13:46.425 --> 13:48.859
It's right around the corner.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.829
Right around the corner.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.488
Right around there.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.369
I think the guy that we're
looking for is right in there.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.840
Hey, thank you.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.077
You're welcome.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.382
Everybody's just worried
about you.

14:13.552 --> 14:14.951
That's all anybody's been saying.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.645
Yeah, but I put you all through
my whole Minnesota odyssey

14:17.823 --> 14:19.450
and then I'm barely there
for two weeks.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.855
Hey, we got a great
going-away party out of it.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.051
Yeah.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.424
<i>And you're home now
and that's what matters.</i>

14:25.598 --> 14:26.724
Well, do you wanna come over?

14:26.899 --> 14:28.924
You know, I can't now.
I'm going out.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.595
Where you going?

14:31.270 --> 14:32.396
To Dylan's.

14:33.572 --> 14:34.630
Say hi for me.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.741
Okay, I will.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.639
- Kel.
- Oh, here come my roommates.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.747
Well, we did it. We got a chance
for an on-air gig at KXCU.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.212
Oh, and they're happy campers.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.283
Howard, the program director,
is the coolest guy.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.750
He said if we have
an air-check tape, he'll listen to it.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.752
I didn't know what he meant,
but David has one.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.448
Well, I'm a professional and
professionals have air-check tapes.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.787
It's basically a reel
of all your best stuff.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.656
Well, Brenda says congratulations.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.491
- Let me talk to her.
- I'll see you later.

14:59.665 --> 15:00.791
I'm gonna go make a sandwich.

15:00.966 --> 15:02.490
David, don't you mess up
the kitchen.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.932
Hi, what happened?

15:05.104 --> 15:06.435
<i>It just didn't work out.</i>

15:06.605 --> 15:07.731
I'll tell you when I see you.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.670
You have to come down
and see our apartment,

15:09.842 --> 15:11.742
which, God forbid,
should my Mom ask,

15:11.911 --> 15:13.503
David does not live at, okay?

15:13.679 --> 15:16.477
Donna, I thought you said
Kelly and Dylan broke up.

15:16.649 --> 15:21.484
Oh, that. Well, I guess I was
a little premature.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.748
Listen, you didn't come back
because of Dylan, did you?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.154
Give me a break.
I may get a little dizzy,

15:27.326 --> 15:29.886
but my life does not revolve
around Dylan McKay.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.954
I was just checking.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.263
Bye.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.599
I still haven't heard one answer
that makes any sense.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.001
What are you planning on doing
if you don't go to school?

15:41.173 --> 15:43.266
I don't know. Maybe I'll travel.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.704
Alone?

15:44.877 --> 15:47.243
- You can go with me.
- Oh, no.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.278
Going off for the summer,
that was one thing.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.006
But the first semester,
that's another.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.480
It doesn't have to be.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.953
Dylan, I got my psych class.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.988
I got Art History with Donna.
I got an apartment.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.649
I'm actually excited
about being at CU with my friends.

16:01.827 --> 16:02.953
It's gonna be a great year.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.652
Why can't you go along
with the program?

16:04.830 --> 16:06.855
The program sucks, Kel.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.432
And I'd rather not be having
this discussion right now.

16:09.601 --> 16:12.092
Fine. You know,
this is Europe all over again.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.863
Goodbye.

16:29.421 --> 16:32.652
I'm sorry I screwed up
your housing plans.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.053
Are you still gonna move out?

16:34.226 --> 16:36.217
I don't know.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.023
Well, I hope you don't.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.257
The last thing I want
is for you to be mad at me.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.424
I'm not mad.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.270
Yes, you are,
you're just pretending not to be

16:46.438 --> 16:48.338
because you are so damn decent.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.737
Well, one of us has to be.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.343
Okay, I deserved that.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.114
All right, Bren.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.050
What happened?

17:06.224 --> 17:09.592
No, it'll just sound
like some sappy cliché to you.

17:10.628 --> 17:11.653
Try me.

17:11.829 --> 17:15.492
Well, I was homesick
after 24 hours there.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.761
I started thinking of September
in California.

17:18.936 --> 17:22.634
Warm Santa Ana winds,
soft nights.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.106
California dreaming
on such a winter's day?

17:25.277 --> 17:26.403
Something like that.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.705
Remember when people used to
ask us where we were from

17:28.881 --> 17:30.781
and we'd say Minnesota?

17:30.949 --> 17:33.543
I guess we're not
from Minnesota anymore.

17:33.719 --> 17:37.314
Well, you're home. Now what?

17:37.489 --> 17:40.390
I don't know. I mean,
I just feel so incredibly out of it.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.686
You're not the only one.

17:42.861 --> 17:46.388
I got a Sociology classroom the size
of the Universal Amphitheater.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.829
And I swear, there are 100 guys
on campus already

17:49.001 --> 17:51.561
who do what I do
as well as I do it.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.762
If I can even remember
what it is that I do.

17:53.939 --> 17:56.032
- You can handle it.
- I don't think so.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.005
I swear, if I don't figure out
where I fit in

17:58.177 --> 17:59.940
at this school pretty soon,
I might just...

18:00.112 --> 18:02.046
You might what? Just drop out?

18:03.682 --> 18:06.310
Unfortunately, I'm not as theatrical
as you are, Bren.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.714
So looks like
we'll be sharing a bathroom

18:11.890 --> 18:14.051
in our parents' house
for the rest of our lives.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.735
Oh, I see you finally decided
to get up.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.340
Mom, it's 8:15 in the morning.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.477
I'm going to go help out
in the recycling co-op.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.942
So if you want breakfast,
you'll have to get it yourself.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.082
That's fine. I'll just swing by
the Peach Pit,

18:37.249 --> 18:38.375
get something to eat there.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.510
Is that what you're planning
on doing with your life?

18:41.687 --> 18:44.315
- Hanging out at the Peach Pit?
- What are you so tense about?

18:44.490 --> 18:47.653
Brenda, just because I let your father
do all the talking yesterday,

18:47.826 --> 18:50.420
doesn't mean
that I don't fully agree with him.

18:50.596 --> 18:51.620
You're very bright.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.560
But it can be a pretty cruel world
out there

18:53.732 --> 18:55.199
without a higher education.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.833
Oh, honey, I just don't think
you gave it a chance.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.371
- Mom...
- Look, you don't have to say anything.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.533
Just think about it for a few days.

19:05.711 --> 19:08.976
Relax, clear your head.

19:09.781 --> 19:12.306
Look, you can always go back
to school next week, right?

19:12.818 --> 19:14.752
Yes, Mom.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.012
Meaning no.

19:17.189 --> 19:20.454
Can't we just go back to the part
where I don't have to say anything?

19:29.601 --> 19:31.831
Oh, Nadene.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.411
- There you go, Dylan.
- Hey.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.609
Breakfast special
just as you like it.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.879
Nat, I didn't order any home fries.

19:50.055 --> 19:53.115
I did order wheat toast
and that's white bread.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.624
I have Willie out sick
and Nadene just nuked the coffee.

19:55.794 --> 19:59.924
Just push the fries off of the plate
and I owe you some fruit, okay?

20:00.098 --> 20:01.622
What about the toast?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.267
What's wrong
with the white bread?

20:03.435 --> 20:05.801
Builds bodies 12 ways.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.671
Oh, Nat, your coffee's killing me.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.006
- Hey.
- Brenda.

20:18.183 --> 20:19.207
How's it going?

20:19.384 --> 20:20.749
Don't ask.
What are you doing here?

20:20.919 --> 20:22.648
- Don't ask.
- I won't.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.550
If you tell your brother
how much I miss him,

20:24.723 --> 20:26.384
maybe he'll take pity on me.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.287
- Doubt it.
- Nice to have you home.

20:30.929 --> 20:33.090
Hey, remember me?

20:33.265 --> 20:34.994
Vaguely, yes. How are you?

20:35.167 --> 20:38.295
I'm okay. Aren't you supposed
to be in school or something?

20:38.470 --> 20:39.994
Couldn't I ask you
the same question?

20:40.172 --> 20:43.039
- I'm glad you didn't.
- I'm sorry you did.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.005
Mind if I join you?

20:45.177 --> 20:47.839
Have a seat.
One condition, no college talk.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.537
Well, that's an easy promise
to make.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.946
All right. Now, all we need's
some service.

20:53.118 --> 20:55.313
Well, I'm in no hurry.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.393
What took you so long?

21:05.564 --> 21:07.031
Bookstore was packed.
Sorry, man.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.894
Spoke to the president
of the K.E.G. House.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.432
Stop the bombing, bro.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.901
Brandon, in case you haven't
noticed, we are sheep here.

21:14.072 --> 21:15.972
There's 8,000 students
trying to make their mark.

21:16.141 --> 21:17.608
Do you wanna get lost
in the shuffle,

21:17.776 --> 21:19.835
or would you like the comfort
of a select brotherhood

21:20.012 --> 21:21.604
that knows the lay of the land?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.543
Brandon, I'm asking you to come
this afternoon

21:23.715 --> 21:25.615
just to see a little preview
of the house.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.615
Why would I wanna be a K.E. G?

21:27.786 --> 21:29.686
For the same reason
everyone wants to be.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.413
You meet people,
you make connections,

21:31.590 --> 21:33.057
you meet women,
you secure liquor.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.216
Gonna have to do
a lot better than that, bro.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.830
It's Party, U.S.A.
Everybody knows this.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.431
It's the playpen
of the Western world.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.625
Steve, I understand
you have a legacy here,

21:43.802 --> 21:45.326
that your father was part
of the frats.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.938
So if you want it, go for it.
But leave me out of it.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.403
What runway are you on?

21:49.574 --> 21:51.804
This has nothing to do with me,
it has to do with us.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.911
Don't you remember?
Birth to Earth...

21:54.079 --> 21:56.946
- Womb to tomb, I got it, I got it.
All right, I'll go.

21:57.115 --> 21:59.310
I knew you'd crumble.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.475
Hey, did you get a message
to see your counselor?

22:01.653 --> 22:03.018
Nope.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.851
My guy wants to see me
about the math tests.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.322
- It can't be good.
- Don't worry about it, Steve.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.485
They can't kick you out of college
for failing a placement test.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.598
No, but can they kick you out
for cheating on one?

22:16.702 --> 22:18.431
Then, right after
the science placement test,

22:18.603 --> 22:20.628
I have to go back
to the fee-payment people

22:20.806 --> 22:22.330
and work out
this whole money situation.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.531
David, don't worry.

22:23.709 --> 22:26.109
I'm capable of getting
the air-check tape to the station.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.940
It's gotta be there by 2:00 sharp.
Are you sure you can do it?

22:29.114 --> 22:32.447
Would you please relax?
I will make sure, okay?

22:33.285 --> 22:34.718
Okay.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.788
Now, it's going right in the glove
compartment for safekeeping.

22:37.956 --> 22:39.787
So concentrate
and do well on your test.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.357
Thanks.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.991
And remember,
it's only our future.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.662
I wanna kill him.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.229
What's wrong?

22:52.404 --> 22:54.998
I just keep hoping Dylan woke up
on the right side of the bed

22:55.173 --> 22:57.073
and decided not to drop out.

22:57.242 --> 23:01.008
Well, he's probably sleeping in.
Keeping that bed warm for you.

23:02.681 --> 23:04.410
So there I was
in the middle of the night

23:04.583 --> 23:07.575
crashing in the dorm hallway
because my roommate had decided

23:07.753 --> 23:09.948
that her boyfriend should stay
in our room.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.386
And I'm thinking, who needs this?

23:12.557 --> 23:15.117
Besides, the classes I got
were so incredibly boring.

23:15.293 --> 23:17.454
Yeah, it's all so lame.

23:17.629 --> 23:20.120
Yeah, but every single time
I try and explain it to my parents,

23:20.298 --> 23:21.356
they just don't get it.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.057
Same with Kelly.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.830
It's like there's only one track,
one goal, one destination.

23:27.005 --> 23:28.063
It's just not true.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.071
Absolutely. I mean,
there are other choices.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.266
Right.

23:31.443 --> 23:33.377
What are you gonna do today?

23:33.845 --> 23:36.746
- Nothing, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.206
We could do it together.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.108
Who's there?

24:09.281 --> 24:10.305
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.074
Hi, welcome to Casa Andrea.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.774
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.386
For you, we found
a great little café right on campus.

24:16.555 --> 24:19.251
Oh, thanks.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.250
Croissants?

24:22.794 --> 24:26.753
Apricot, cheese, chocolate chip.
You guys, how could you do this?

24:26.932 --> 24:28.126
Well, because we love you.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.791
And we want you to get fat,
not us.

24:31.336 --> 24:33.634
- Thanks.
- Oh, this place is fabulous.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.829
I know. I feel so guilty.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.406
All the other freshmen
have rooms the size of my desk.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.443
Well, California University had to do
something to snatch you from Yale.

24:40.946 --> 24:43.506
Where I'm sure they would not
have gotten me a computer.

24:43.682 --> 24:44.774
Did you see this?

24:44.950 --> 24:46.815
Oh, my God.
They gave you a laser printer too.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.179
Don't let my mother see this,

24:48.353 --> 24:50.150
she'll wonder why I didn't stay
in the dorms.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.223
Well, just tell her they didn't have
the right necessities.

24:53.391 --> 24:54.983
Like David.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.219
Do I smell croissants
from Cafe Delicious?

24:57.395 --> 24:58.692
You certainly do.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.195
Any chance I can buy one?

25:00.365 --> 25:01.662
How about on the house?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.027
Thanks.

25:03.902 --> 25:05.733
Hi, I'm Andrea Zuckerman.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.338
And this is Donna Martin
and Kelly Taylor.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.873
Hi. Dan Rubin.

25:11.943 --> 25:13.274
So you all live here?

25:13.445 --> 25:16.243
No, actually, I do. What about you?

25:16.414 --> 25:18.279
- Fellow freshman?
- Perpetual grad student.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.940
I'm also the dorm's
resident advisor.

25:20.118 --> 25:21.710
Then it really is
a pleasure to meet you.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.320
Likewise.

25:24.956 --> 25:26.685
Well, how about an apricot?

25:27.859 --> 25:29.417
I'm a chocolate chip kind of guy.

25:30.228 --> 25:31.627
Better you than me.

25:32.631 --> 25:35.225
Thanks. Well, I'll see you
around, Andrea.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.697
Have a good day, ladies.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.601
An RA with a sweet tooth.

25:43.108 --> 25:46.908
Interesting. Delicious.

25:47.445 --> 25:48.469
Stop.

25:48.647 --> 25:50.877
Hey, we're gonna go check out
the bookstore. Wanna come?

25:51.049 --> 25:53.313
I'd love to, but I have to go
do this restaurant review

25:53.485 --> 25:55.009
for the newspaper.

25:55.186 --> 25:58.121
Can you believe
that he's a graduate student?

25:58.823 --> 26:00.586
Andrea.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.596
It's not our coffee.

26:10.769 --> 26:13.237
It's the cream, it went sour.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.306
Here, have another cup.
Use these packets.

26:16.474 --> 26:19.602
Ron, take all the creamers
off the table.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.211
And then go check
the fridge, okay?

26:21.379 --> 26:22.676
Hey, Nat.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.542
Place looks busy,
must be the food.

26:24.716 --> 26:26.206
Here I was hoping for a booth.

26:26.384 --> 26:29.251
I wanna get through lunch without
the Board of Health closing me down.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.445
You want your usual?

26:30.622 --> 26:32.055
No, I think I'm gonna look
at a menu.

26:32.223 --> 26:35.158
Well. Oh, sir, don't use that.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.933
If you're gonna order,
better do it now.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.872
I think I'll start
with the lobster bisque and then...

26:57.048 --> 26:58.447
You don't want the bisque.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.415
It's milk-based,
and you could get food poisoning.

27:01.586 --> 27:05.044
- Have the vegetable soup.
- Okay.

27:05.223 --> 27:06.850
And then I'll have
the Catalina Salad

27:07.025 --> 27:14.056
with the sirloin tips rolled in a pita,
with spicy fries and...

27:14.232 --> 27:18.066
Andrea, you always have
the megaburger or the tuna melt.

27:18.236 --> 27:20.500
Why are you getting creative
on me now?

27:20.672 --> 27:22.003
Oh, I...

27:29.848 --> 27:30.872
Just stay calm.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.483
Well, the ambience is wonderful.

27:36.821 --> 27:41.053
- Oh, I told you not to park here.
- What?

27:41.226 --> 27:44.252
I wanted to be near the radio station.
Besides, it was a good spot.

27:44.429 --> 27:47.660
Oh, that's why
it's faculty parking only.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.557
It's hot in here.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.531
Roll down the window.

27:53.705 --> 27:54.933
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.664
It's hot.

27:58.476 --> 27:59.568
What is that smell?

28:12.457 --> 28:14.550
It's all right. It's fine.

28:14.726 --> 28:19.095
I'm sure David has another copy.

28:19.264 --> 28:21.528
No, I don't have another copy.
How could you be so stupid?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.565
David. I don't believe this.

28:23.735 --> 28:25.259
I don't believe this either.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.701
She ruined the tape by melting it.
How do you melt a tape?

28:27.872 --> 28:29.100
It wasn't my fault.

28:29.274 --> 28:30.502
Then whose fault was it, Donna?

28:30.675 --> 28:32.302
Oh, let me guess,
Bill Clinton, right?

28:32.477 --> 28:34.411
Hey, let's blame it on Bill.
Everybody else does.

28:34.579 --> 28:36.342
Well, don't you have
another air-check tape?

28:36.514 --> 28:38.607
No, Donna, that's it.
That's the only one I had.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.648
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.081
You know, maybe you're not quite

28:42.253 --> 28:43.777
as professional as you thought
you were.

28:43.955 --> 28:45.479
Let's leave.

28:50.328 --> 28:53.058
Europe has sort
of a timeless quality to it.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.255
I know what you mean.

28:54.432 --> 28:57.492
When I was there, I got really
caught up in the Old World mystique.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.864
- It really sort of takes you over.
- Yeah.

29:00.038 --> 29:02.632
I know. I wanted to write poetry,
the great novel.

29:02.807 --> 29:06.072
- Did you?
- No, I just bummed around.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.235
But I got the feeling, you know,
walking through

29:08.413 --> 29:10.574
all those old villages,
that every stone I stepped on

29:10.749 --> 29:14.150
could have been stepped on
by Rimbaud or Baudelaire.

29:14.319 --> 29:15.752
Because they were bums too,
you know.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.911
They know you gotta live it
before you can write it.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.386
You're the only guy I know

29:19.557 --> 29:22.185
who knows who Rimbaud
and Baudelaire are.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.418
Who?

29:24.062 --> 29:25.393
Well, I loved Paris.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.997
It must be incredible when
you're there with someone you love.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.728
I don't know about that.

29:30.902 --> 29:32.870
I knew we were in trouble
on the Left Bank.

29:33.238 --> 29:35.900
Kelly had dragged me into, like,
the 20th shoe store of the day

29:36.074 --> 29:39.271
and I just snuck out
to find Balzac's house.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.775
I went to Balzac's house.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.708
How long did it take you
to find it?

29:42.881 --> 29:44.314
I will never tell.

29:44.482 --> 29:45.813
Well, the looking's the fun part.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.043
There's not much to it
once you get there.

29:48.219 --> 29:50.517
You know,
I really missed you, Dylan.

29:50.688 --> 29:52.121
I missed you too, Bren.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.520
I called you in Minnesota
to wish you good luck.

29:54.692 --> 29:56.626
I could have used it.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.629
Well, this is it.
You wanna keep walking?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.129
What, right off the pier?

30:01.299 --> 30:02.425
Yeah, maybe.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.659
What's the alternatives?

30:05.537 --> 30:06.561
I'm thinking.

30:12.377 --> 30:13.401
Look out now.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.443
So, what do you think?

30:15.613 --> 30:16.637
Go fish?

30:16.815 --> 30:18.373
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:21.786 --> 30:23.777
- Donna.
- David, it was an accident.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.354
It could have happened
to anyone.

30:25.523 --> 30:26.615
Donna, please.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.850
You have no idea
how embarrassing this is for me.

30:29.027 --> 30:30.085
And for me.

30:30.261 --> 30:31.785
Can I please explain
what happened?

30:31.963 --> 30:33.828
No, not if you're gonna sit there
and blame me.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.329
Donna, you're making it worse.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.730
Excuse me, I have the right
to tell my side of the story.

30:37.902 --> 30:40.097
It wasn't like I had any idea
what was gonna happen.

30:40.271 --> 30:41.863
Like there was a warning label
that says,

30:42.040 --> 30:44.440
"If left in sun, tape will melt. "

30:44.609 --> 30:46.577
I mean, I would never do that
with Brie cheese.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.803
- Because Brie has a label.
- Donna.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.039
We're trying to get
another chance to audition.

30:51.216 --> 30:54.583
Not argue whether audio tape
has any similarity to Brie,

30:54.752 --> 30:55.844
which it doesn't.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.545
Oh, please, like you're
the big cheese expert?

30:58.723 --> 31:00.384
Okay, you know what,
maybe not even Brie.

31:00.558 --> 31:03.118
Maybe like a semi-soft Cambert
left on a buffet.

31:03.294 --> 31:04.318
- A Camembert.
- Whatever.

31:04.495 --> 31:07.123
Or a Gorgonzola, which gets
really sweaty when left in the heat.

31:07.298 --> 31:09.357
Like someone else that I know.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.867
I mean, a proper label indicating
a product be stored in a cool place

31:13.037 --> 31:15.505
is not too much to ask, is it?

31:15.673 --> 31:17.265
It was an honest mistake.

31:17.442 --> 31:18.466
It's a total tank.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.611
Listen, don't pay any attention
to her, okay?

31:20.778 --> 31:23.269
I'm sorry,
this will never happen again.

31:30.121 --> 31:31.486
I like you guys.

31:35.026 --> 31:38.052
"Therefore, it is very probable
you'll receive your food semi-warm.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.164
In conclusion, despite it's pleasant
setting and try-to-please style,

31:41.332 --> 31:42.799
food lovers beware.

31:42.967 --> 31:46.528
The Peach Pit is more
of a pit than a peach"?

31:46.704 --> 31:47.762
What's the matter with you?

31:47.939 --> 31:49.998
Brandon, you don't know
this Richland character.

31:50.174 --> 31:51.641
I mean, he eats freshmen alive.

31:51.809 --> 31:53.777
He's not gonna care
that Nat and I are buddies.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.378
Hey, do what you gotta do.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.207
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong.

31:57.382 --> 31:59.976
But maybe now, you see why
I didn't wanna go out for the paper.

32:00.151 --> 32:02.642
<i>Wait a minute, you're not gonna
go to the Condor office with me?</i>

32:02.820 --> 32:04.913
- Please, show some support.
- No, I'm not going.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.581
I told Steve that I'd go
on this tour with him

32:08.760 --> 32:10.523
of Kappa Epsilon Gamma House.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.721
Wait a minute, you a K.E. G?

32:15.133 --> 32:18.398
Believe me, I don't know what's
going on with me at this school.

32:18.569 --> 32:20.764
Don't worry about it.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.702
None of us know what's going on.

32:26.177 --> 32:28.202
But the writing style's okay?

32:28.379 --> 32:29.539
The writing style's fine.

32:29.714 --> 32:32.239
I just wish, for Nat's sake,
you would have written a puff piece

32:32.417 --> 32:33.611
instead of a hatchet job.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.446
Look, Brandon,
I have to approach this

32:35.620 --> 32:37.110
as an objective journalist, okay?

32:37.288 --> 32:39.222
I mean, it's a matter
of professional integrity,

32:39.390 --> 32:41.688
- you understand that.
- Andrea, I understand.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.726
<i>And I understand how much
you wanna be on The Condor,</i>

32:44.896 --> 32:46.295
but what about your integrity?

32:46.464 --> 32:51.367
This from a man who's considering
joining the animal house on campus.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.367
And we believe
that a membership in K.E.G.

32:55.540 --> 32:56.939
Is an outstanding opportunity.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.406
Our goal is to organize
our brothers' social lives

32:59.577 --> 33:02.068
in order to promote
their educational objectives.

33:02.246 --> 33:04.476
It's an experience
in living together,

33:04.649 --> 33:05.673
sharing maintenance,

33:05.850 --> 33:07.681
self government,
personal relations,

33:07.852 --> 33:09.786
so that the entire
community benefits

33:09.954 --> 33:11.854
both socially and intellectually.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.450
Don't believe a word of that.

33:13.624 --> 33:16.149
Before we continue,
why don't I shut up?

33:16.327 --> 33:18.955
You get something to drink,
then we'll go inside.

33:20.898 --> 33:22.160
Dixon.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.766
Steve Sanders.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.630
I understand you're
a good athlete, Sanders.

33:25.803 --> 33:27.828
Thanks. We should play a little
one-on-one sometime.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.997
Anytime. We got softball,
basketball, flag football,

33:30.174 --> 33:31.266
even hockey.

33:31.442 --> 33:33.467
- Hockey?
- This guy's a killer.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.612
- Really?
- Well, I can play.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.441
No, my man's just being modest,
believe me.

33:37.615 --> 33:38.639
He grew up in Minnesota.

33:38.816 --> 33:40.044
Son, that's practically Canada.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.880
Well, there's nine months of winter
and three months of bad skating.

33:43.654 --> 33:45.986
- All right, we'll talk.
- All right.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.725
Okay, everyone,
when you follow Tom in,

33:48.893 --> 33:51.259
please note the canisters
underneath the stairs.

33:51.429 --> 33:52.555
If you become a brother here,

33:52.730 --> 33:54.391
you'll become very familiar
with them.

33:54.565 --> 33:56.362
Is that where the K.E.G.'s
keep the kegs?

33:57.235 --> 33:59.795
No, those are the recycling bins.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.235
Clothing, books,
CD's that aren't wanted

34:02.407 --> 34:05.069
are collected and appreciated
by the charity sponsor store

34:05.243 --> 34:07.143
that we have in South Central.

34:07.311 --> 34:10.610
Yes, gentlemen,
K.E.G. Really cares.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.449
I wonder when this fraternity
became so politically correct.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.610
Oh, I'm impressed, Sanders.

34:17.789 --> 34:19.085
All right, bro, I gotta take off.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.885
Gotta see my counselor about that
test, so hang in with this, okay?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.925
You got it.

34:26.464 --> 34:27.987
What's up, guys?

34:40.678 --> 34:43.168
Now, that's more like it.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.005
All right, you little...

34:46.184 --> 34:49.176
Hey, hey, all right, I got you.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.452
Okay.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.420
Oh, you slippery little sucker.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.289
Allow me, I am from the land
of 10,000 lakes.

34:58.463 --> 34:59.487
That's right.

34:59.664 --> 35:03.862
Okay, the trick is to get the hook in
and around in one clean motion.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.165
- Bren?
- Did I hook you?

35:07.338 --> 35:08.965
Just my sweatshirt.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.732
Don't move.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.412
- There you go.
- Thanks.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.455
I've seen that look before.

35:32.363 --> 35:33.921
It's the same one you have.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.160
We can't go down
this road again.

35:36.334 --> 35:37.562
Why not?

35:37.735 --> 35:40.727
I think because I don't want to ruin
this feeling that's between us now.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.341
Yeah, you're right.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.479
We're probably better off
as just friends.

35:49.013 --> 35:50.378
Close friends.

35:51.282 --> 35:53.250
The closest.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.795
Mr. Richland.

36:14.972 --> 36:17.998
If it's about the freshmen reviews,
the deadline hasn't changed.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.077
It's 5:00. You've still got
a couple hours to do it.

36:21.245 --> 36:23.372
- I've done it.
- Good.

36:23.548 --> 36:26.073
Drop it in the hopper
and we'll get back to you.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.246
Well, I thought
that I'd come here in person

36:28.419 --> 36:33.618
to tell you
that I won't be handing it in.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.521
- What?
- Well, I've thought about it

36:40.698 --> 36:43.030
and I've come to the conclusion

36:43.201 --> 36:46.364
that I'm not cut out
to be a little fish.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.131
Look, I know
who you are, Zuckerman.

36:50.007 --> 36:51.702
<i>You did great work on the Blaze.</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:55.175
We definitely want you here,
so relax.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.007
Well, maybe I don't want it.

36:57.648 --> 37:02.642
<i>I don't think that I have that killer
instinct to be a part of The Condor.</i>

37:13.130 --> 37:16.293
Okay, I hear you.

37:16.467 --> 37:17.729
But let me give you some advice.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.995
If you're not on the newspaper,
there's not much point

37:20.171 --> 37:21.536
in being a Journalism major.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.503
Or there's always premed.

37:27.812 --> 37:32.545
Mr. Sanders,
as freshman counselor,

37:32.717 --> 37:35.447
it's my job to keep you
on the educational path

37:35.620 --> 37:37.611
that your aptitude deserves.

37:38.889 --> 37:43.485
Well, after reviewing
your math placement test,

37:43.661 --> 37:45.322
I'm recommending...

37:45.496 --> 37:48.465
<i>Here it comes, I'm dead meat.</i>

37:49.100 --> 37:53.161
...that you be enrolled in
our Advanced Astrophysics Program.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.064
- Astrophysics?
- It's a junior elective.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.071
And from it, a number
of our graduates

37:58.242 --> 37:59.800
have gone on directly to NASA.

38:00.311 --> 38:02.677
I just feel badly that someone
as gifted as yourself

38:02.847 --> 38:04.815
had to take the test
in the first place.

38:04.982 --> 38:08.349
No, don't. It's no big deal.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.146
Astrophysics, huh?

38:10.321 --> 38:12.152
Along with my other
required math courses?

38:12.323 --> 38:15.724
Oh, no, there's no need to bore you
with what you already know.

38:15.893 --> 38:18.862
You'll never have to take them
or the sophomore ones either.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.895
This way, you'll be free
for more electives.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.592
Oh, I see.

38:23.768 --> 38:27.431
Yes, well, I'm honored.

38:27.605 --> 38:30.665
But I'm just wondering
if this is really in my best interest.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.866
- What do you mean?
- Well, Mr. Bardwell,

38:33.444 --> 38:36.504
it's obvious I'm already so far
ahead of my peers in math,

38:36.681 --> 38:38.706
I was thinking
maybe now is the time

38:38.883 --> 38:40.714
to develop my other aptitudes.

38:40.885 --> 38:46.414
Maybe a folklore course
or History of Film.

38:46.590 --> 38:48.490
You see, I've always felt
that it's the whole man

38:48.659 --> 38:50.320
that benefits the most
in the long run.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.291
Don't you?

38:52.463 --> 38:54.397
This is so refreshing, Steve.

38:54.565 --> 38:57.796
Most prodigies are in such
a hurry to succeed,

38:57.968 --> 39:01.062
they don't take the time
to smell the roses.

39:01.238 --> 39:04.833
History of Film
would be an excellent idea.

39:12.283 --> 39:15.878
Hey, excuse me. Hi.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.219
- Aren't you Brandon Walsh?
- Yeah.

39:19.390 --> 39:20.414
I'm Josh Richland.

39:20.591 --> 39:21.990
<i>I'm managing editor
of The Condor.</i>

39:22.159 --> 39:23.319
I was hoping you'd stop by.

39:23.494 --> 39:26.190
Yeah, listen, man, I really have
no interest in working on the paper.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.525
That's good, because I got
something else to talk about.

39:28.699 --> 39:29.723
What's that?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.595
How'd you like to run
for student senate

39:31.769 --> 39:33.760
as freshman representative
of the Progressive Party?

39:33.938 --> 39:35.997
Progressive Party?

39:37.141 --> 39:38.403
Why me?

39:38.576 --> 39:40.544
Aren't you the Brandon Walsh
who led 600 students

39:40.711 --> 39:43.145
against the school board
and shut down West Beverly High?

39:43.881 --> 39:46.645
- Yeah.
- Welcome to California University.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.687
How you doing?

39:56.460 --> 40:00.021
At losing bait, great.
At catching fish, lousy.

40:00.197 --> 40:01.323
You got a nibble, though.

40:01.499 --> 40:04.263
Yeah, well, we should have
just have rented some scuba gear,

40:04.602 --> 40:06.160
swam with a huge school of fish.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.429
Couldn't miss with that.

40:08.672 --> 40:11.971
It reminds me of a joke my dad
used to tell me, it cracked me up.

40:12.143 --> 40:14.475
No doubt a blond joke.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.237
No.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.008
What do you call
the dumbest fish in school?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.377
Dinner.

40:21.552 --> 40:24.020
Get it? Dinner, school, fish, dumb?

40:24.188 --> 40:26.247
- I get it.
- So why aren't you laughing, Bren?

40:26.424 --> 40:29.723
Because that would make us
dumber than the dumbest fish.

40:29.894 --> 40:32.590
Right, a couple of uneducated
mackerel. Hey, Bren.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.425
Flounders without a college degree.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.661
- There you go. Reel it, come on.
- Hey, he's fighting.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.362
Crank it, Bren, here you go.
All right.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.839
Hey.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.005
Very good.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.473
Would you like it?

40:52.650 --> 40:55.278
No, too small.
Needs time to grow.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.717
Yeah, he's right, Bren.
Throw it back.

40:57.888 --> 41:00.015
All right, little fish,
be lucky you're not dinner.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.159
Now go join your friends.

41:05.229 --> 41:06.821
You done?

41:07.665 --> 41:09.098
Yeah.

41:10.267 --> 41:13.327
It was a great idea. A great day.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.936
It's too bad we can't spend
our whole lives fishing, though.

41:17.107 --> 41:20.076
Especially not a guy who reads
Baudelaire and Rimbaud.

41:21.045 --> 41:24.879
Or a girl who goes out of her way
to find Balzac's house.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.746
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

41:31.455 --> 41:33.923
<i>Hey, this is Dylan.
You know the drill.</i>

41:34.725 --> 41:36.852
Dylan, if you're there, pick up.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.655
I'm sorry I got so mad at you.

41:39.830 --> 41:42.663
- Are you there?
- Kel.

41:43.133 --> 41:44.157
Where have you guys been?

41:44.335 --> 41:46.098
I thought I lost my roommates
and my boyfriend.

41:46.270 --> 41:47.294
We were celebrating.

41:47.471 --> 41:49.996
You're looking at the only
two freshmen DJs on KXCU.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.870
We went to explain to the program
director, he hired us on the spot.

41:53.043 --> 41:54.635
- He loved our chemistry.
- Our hostility.

41:54.812 --> 41:57.110
We're working six days a week
and we'll be on from 2 to 6.

41:57.281 --> 41:58.873
That's great.
Everybody will be tuned in.

41:59.049 --> 42:01.882
Well, it's not that 2 to 6.

42:02.419 --> 42:03.477
What 2 to 6?

42:05.389 --> 42:06.583
Two to 6 a. M?

42:06.757 --> 42:07.951
Well, it's still radio.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.650
I know, but why did Howie
have to call it the graveyard shift?

42:10.828 --> 42:13.854
Probably because the only people
listening at that hour are zombies.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.055
Oh, thank you.

42:19.503 --> 42:23.234
David, if you use the kitchen
again, I'm gonna...

42:26.510 --> 42:27.568
Hi.

42:27.745 --> 42:29.610
Having a bubble bath?

42:29.780 --> 42:31.680
I'm glad to see you.

42:31.849 --> 42:34.317
You're not too hard
on the eyes either.

42:36.387 --> 42:39.879
So where have you been?
I left a message for you.

42:40.057 --> 42:44.118
Well, I've been fishing all day
with Brenda. It was pretty fun.

42:46.363 --> 42:48.194
Hey, Kel, we're just friends,
remember?

42:48.899 --> 42:50.298
Right.

42:52.002 --> 42:53.333
So you still mad at me?

42:53.504 --> 42:55.699
I'm going back
to campus tomorrow.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.331
- You are?
- Yeah.

42:58.509 --> 43:01.239
I figure with late registration
and everything, I could still get in.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.812
You're gonna love it, Dylan.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.951
What do you call
the dumbest fish in school?

43:10.955 --> 43:12.354
You.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.457
Brenda.

43:24.635 --> 43:25.829
Come downstairs.

43:26.003 --> 43:28.198
We're in the kitchen, honey.

43:31.842 --> 43:33.935
Brenda has something to tell you.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.476
Well, it can wait.

43:35.646 --> 43:38.046
Because I have something to say.

43:38.215 --> 43:41.480
All right, you don't wanna go
to school, so be it.

43:41.652 --> 43:45.349
But you will get a job
and you will pay rent.

43:45.522 --> 43:47.683
At least that'll help cover
some of Brandon's costs

43:47.858 --> 43:48.950
- when he moves out.
- Jim.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.559
No, no, no, don't get me wrong.

43:50.728 --> 43:53.697
I don't want Brenda to think
this is some kind of punishment.

43:53.864 --> 43:59.200
Because the fact is
she has a lot of talent.

43:59.570 --> 44:02.539
If she sticks with her acting,
maybe she'll make it big someday,

44:02.706 --> 44:04.901
and I can retire a lot earlier.

44:05.509 --> 44:07.670
Dad, I hate to crimp
your leisure plans,

44:07.845 --> 44:10.405
but I'm going back to school
at California University.

44:10.581 --> 44:12.981
And I'm in no rush to move out.

44:13.917 --> 44:14.975
Did I miss something here?

44:15.185 --> 44:18.177
Brenda needs to grow before
charging into the cruel world,

44:18.355 --> 44:20.323
and she wants to go
to school with her friends.

44:20.491 --> 44:23.289
I shouldn't be afraid
to change my mind, should I?

44:24.995 --> 44:26.929
God bless your mother.
