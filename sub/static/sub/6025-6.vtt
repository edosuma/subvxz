WEBVTT

00:07.360 --> 00:10.284
Kidney function, liver function,
testosterone...

00:10.360 --> 00:11.481
I don't know how you did it,

00:11.520 --> 00:15.206
but you have essentially aged 40 years
in the last seven weeks.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.645
Wow. Really?

00:16.720 --> 00:18.529
We had a meth addict in here this morning

00:18.600 --> 00:21.843
who was biologically younger
than you are, and he's 58.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.091
MySpace guy.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.245
So what is going on?

00:26.600 --> 00:27.647
Uh...

00:27.720 --> 00:30.007
It's this cloud service configuration,

00:30.080 --> 00:32.765
- I've been stuck on it for over a week.
- Wow.

00:32.840 --> 00:35.525
I'm a good programmer.
I mean, it's the only thing I am good at.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.489
I mean, last year,
I threw a Frisbee and I chipped my tooth.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.925
Oh, that's more of a dental issue.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.411
Yup, okay, I...

00:40.480 --> 00:44.121
The point is, I learned Ruby on Rails
over a weekend when I was 17.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.521
I should be able to learn cloud, I have to.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.001
May I give you my professional opinion,
as your doctor?

00:50.120 --> 00:53.363
You should have taken that $10 million
from Gavin Belson, okay?

00:53.960 --> 00:56.611
But regrets will kill ya,
so try not to dwell on it.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.284
I tried to tell you.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.563
Outside help?
No, we're not getting any outside help.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.530
It's a week until TechCrunch, Richard.
We can't wait any longer.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.523
Richard, look at the board.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.401
Okay, cloud architecture is just a giant
turd that is clogging up our pipes.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.608
We have to call in a plumber to fix it.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.763
Okay, I hate that metaphor,
but Erlich is right.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.810
Gilfoyle and I finished
the distribution services days ago

01:30.880 --> 01:32.530
and we're just sitting
around waiting for you.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.843
- I can solve it.
- Richard, you're a fucking rock star, okay?

01:35.920 --> 01:37.729
You just don't know cloud,

01:37.800 --> 01:42.522
this tiny, little, shitty area,
which is becoming super important,

01:42.600 --> 01:44.682
and in many ways is the
future of computing.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.929
That sort of went south on me,
but you understand what I'm saying.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.890
I've already talked to Peter Gregory
about insourcing a consultant.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.691
I've made contact with a programmer
whose cloud architecture

01:55.800 --> 01:58.929
is supposed to be insane.
They call him The Carver.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.126
The Carver?

02:00.560 --> 02:03.404
That Black Hat guy who apparently hacked
into the Bank of America

02:03.480 --> 02:05.562
and took down their entire system,
that The Carver?

02:05.640 --> 02:07.051
We should get him if we can.

02:09.759 --> 02:14.482
Okay, we can talk to the guy, but, I
mean, he's really gonna have to sell me.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.406
Six months ago,
these guys had $35 million

02:24.480 --> 02:25.811
and Series B financing.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.884
Now The Carver's here doing teardown.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.321
He's basically moving their carcass
to the cloud.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.324
Don't touch anything.
Failure is contagious.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.410
I think that's him.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.330
Excuse me, Mr. Carver?

02:47.440 --> 02:51.490
Yeah, uh, people refer to me
as The Carver,

02:51.560 --> 02:55.007
but no one actually calls me that.
It's, uh, what people call a screen name.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.606
You know. I'm Kevin.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.765
Okay, Kevin, um, we're from Pied Piper,
we spoke earlier.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.366
- Yeah, so you guys are fucked, huh?
- No. No, we're not fucked.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.805
Yes, we are totally fucked.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.201
We have a live demo in one week
and our cloud is in the shitter.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.521
- That's accurate.
- Wait, are you Richard?

03:11.560 --> 03:12.891
Yes, I am.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.045
Yeah, your, uh, algorithm is solid.
It's a really good schema.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.849
Okay, thanks.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.362
I did think you'd be younger.
What are you, 25?

03:22.440 --> 03:23.646
I'm 26.

03:23.720 --> 03:24.926
Yikes.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.689
Uh, so I have a Model UN thing on Monday,

03:29.760 --> 03:32.127
but maybe I could burn through your gig
over the weekend.

03:32.200 --> 03:36.649
Mmm. You think you can do our whole job
in two days?

03:36.720 --> 03:38.961
I know I can do it in two days.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.522
I pound Mello Yello, Oreos and Adderall
and I don't sleep until I'm done.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.768
Okay.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.171
But you know what? I also have an offer

03:46.240 --> 03:47.844
to do some migration at Gittawonk
this weekend.

03:47.920 --> 03:52.164
It's, uh... It's kind of chill, and
frankly, their tech's a little stronger.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.322
Whoa. What? What?

03:54.720 --> 03:56.927
You think Gittawonk's tech
is stronger than ours?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.651
I'm sorry, I don't remember reading
in PandoDaily

03:59.760 --> 04:02.764
that Gavin Belson and Peter Gregory
were fighting over Gittawonk.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.083
No one offered $10 million
to acquire Gittawonk.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.403
Yeah, I agree with Richard,
you should come work for us.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.960
- What... No...
- What's it gonna take, a blow-job?

04:12.040 --> 04:14.771
Because Richard will suck the
dick right off of your pelvis.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.083
Now, you make me laugh, shaggy man.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.128
All right, I'm in. I'll
see you guys Friday.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.651
Okay.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.521
- Well done.
- Yeah.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.964
Excuse me.
Hi, um, would you guys be interested

04:37.040 --> 04:39.725
in buying some candy so you can
send my church group to camp?

04:39.840 --> 04:40.887
Nope.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.846
Erlich, come on.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.570
$100 says there's no church.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.409
Whole thing's a scam, little scumbags.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.970
They're just children.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.964
Looks like Gilfoyle and his lady Satanist
are back from the airport.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.361
Can you imagine what kind
of shit-show this one's gonna be?

04:53.480 --> 04:55.847
He says that she has an Amy Winehouse vibe.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.400
What does that mean?
All tatted-up and nowhere to go?

04:58.480 --> 05:01.131
- Hooked on OxyContin?
- Decomposing?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.726
Oh. Oh, okay, that was dark.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.566
Gentlemen, this is Tara.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.369
- Hey.
- Tara, this is the fellas.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.522
Jared, Dinesh,
Erlich and Richard.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.171
- It's Erlich.
- Oh, it's great to finally meet you guys.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.001
Hi.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.641
All right.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.807
Hmm.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.684
Jesus, where did he
get Amy Winehouse from?

05:26.760 --> 05:30.765
I mean, I'd have sex with that
if you hose the Gilfoyle off of her.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.401
It's weird having a girl in the house.
There's a very strange energy.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.161
Hmm.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.728
Hello... Kevin.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.846
Okay, Richard,
I just need you to approve Kevin's fee.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.367
I got Erlich to sign
and you just sign right there.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.011
$20,000 for two days.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.881
You know who else thought
my price was too high?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.088
- BitRaptor.
- Who?

06:04.520 --> 06:05.806
Exactly.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.331
Great. Peter Gregory is on his way out
of town so I'm gonna hustle out there

06:11.400 --> 06:12.970
and get him to co-sign these

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
and the check,
and I'll be back as soon as I can.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.367
- Well, go.
- Thank you.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.122
You okay over there?
You have any questions...

06:22.200 --> 06:24.567
Yeah, one question.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.880
Cool. Shoot.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.884
Why do you keep your lips
pressed so tight together

06:28.960 --> 06:30.007
when you're not talking?

06:30.960 --> 06:32.564
'Cause they're like white.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.640
It looks uncomfortable.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.170
Hey, guys.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.490
Hey, Kevin, um,

06:55.600 --> 06:59.161
so how did you bypass
Bank of America's network security?

06:59.360 --> 07:00.521
I want details.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.084
My lawyers told me
I'm not allowed to discuss it.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.362
Totally get it. That's baller.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.361
- Hey, babe? You're up.
- Hmm.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.841
- All right, I'm gonna go have a shower.
Mmm-hmm.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.282
- Uh, what was that?
- What?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.802
Tara just whispered something to you
and then she looked at me in a weird way.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.641
No, she didn't.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.321
Yeah, she did.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.845
What's up?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.684
Do you know what compression is?

08:11.440 --> 08:15.161
It's when someone takes pleasure
in seeing their loved one gratified

08:15.240 --> 08:16.605
by another person.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.609
Sexually. It's the opposite of jealousy.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.566
It sounds like it's the opposite of normal.
Why are you telling me about this thing?

08:25.560 --> 08:27.927
As shocking as this is...

08:29.440 --> 08:31.727
Tara is attracted to you.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.765
Come again?

08:35.840 --> 08:39.322
Yeah, freaked me out, too, at first.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.405
I don't like the "at first" part at all.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.720
What are you saying?

08:43.799 --> 08:45.768
Since I abide by the maxim,

08:45.840 --> 08:48.446
"Do what thou wilt,
that is the whole of the law,"

08:49.600 --> 08:51.364
if you want to fuck my girlfriend,
I'm okay with it.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.967
Jesus Christ, man, I could barely stand
next to you when you're in your towel.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.849
I don't want to have a threesome with you.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.649
I'm not talking about a threesome.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.883
Listen, I don't even have to be in the
room, unless that's better for you.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.291
Okay, no, I don't...

09:07.280 --> 09:09.203
Right, so we're all settled then?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.362
- Yep.
- Do you need parking validation?

09:11.440 --> 09:13.329
No, I, uh, used Lyft.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.568
So I'll Lyft it back.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.369
Why don't I have Peter's car take you home?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.568
He's not using it,
we're shipping off to Arallon tomorrow.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.803
- Arallon?
- Yeah, the island Peter's building.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.402
What's the... The red line?

09:28.480 --> 09:29.891
That's the International Date Line.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.564
The island's built right on it

09:31.640 --> 09:34.166
so the western half can celebrate
the first New Year's on Earth,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.402
then the next day,
they walk over to the eastern half

09:36.480 --> 09:38.323
and celebrate the last New Year's on Earth.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.120
But if you can walk,
why does he need the car on the island?

09:41.160 --> 09:44.050
Peter's not really big on walking.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.722
So I'll just have the guys
pull it up front for you.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.801
Great.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.651
Driverless car.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.649
<i>Select destination.</i>

10:11.720 --> 10:16.248
Hi, um... I'm going to 5230

10:33.960 --> 10:35.485
<i>You'?</i>

10:35.560 --> 10:38.803
Tara wants to have sex with you? You sure?

10:38.880 --> 10:41.167
Yeah, Gilfoyle just told me, to my face.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.323
He told you that Tara wants to copulate
with someone else in the house

10:44.400 --> 10:47.768
other than him
and that someone is you, Dinesh?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.205
Yeah, that's...

10:49.280 --> 10:52.887
You know, you seem confused by this
but for a different reason than I am.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.810
Don't you think it's weird
that Tara wants some strange

10:55.880 --> 10:58.850
and she chooses you over me,

10:58.920 --> 11:00.809
the logical person in the house?

11:00.880 --> 11:04.009
Okay, I see where we are ending up on this.
Thank you for your time.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.163
Wait, are you sure that
she didn't ask Gilfoyle

11:07.240 --> 11:10.210
for a Danish and maybe you misheard her?

11:10.280 --> 11:12.806
You're probably right,
she just wanted to fuck a Danish.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.685
Wait, you just built all
the indexes on the fly?

11:15.760 --> 11:17.046
Yeah, of course.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.771
Okay, well... Well, then what's that?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.605
The key value store.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.006
Tuples.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.330
Speak English?

11:32.560 --> 11:34.721
You're kind of doing that
lip thing again there, buddy.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.444
No, I'm not.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.170
Stop looking at my lips.

I'm sorry, what... Mr. Car?

12:10.400 --> 12:13.404
Hey. Tara and I are going
to a Satanic baptism.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.527
You wanna come?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.887
Stu Burns decided to walk
the left-hand path with us.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.521
The database administrator for Yahoo
is becoming a Satanist?

12:20.600 --> 12:21.886
We're everywhere.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.009
Hey, Erlich, are you coming? Dinesh is.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.411
He is?

12:28.080 --> 12:30.003
This is Monica.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.401
Hi, Monica, it's Jared.
Uh, quick question...

12:32.520 --> 12:33.931
Jared, I can't talk right now.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.843
One of our assistants
has been confusing the eastern,

12:35.920 --> 12:38.287
western time zones of
Arallon on work orders.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.165
Now a bunch of important things
are happening a day early.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.011
<i>Peter is going to be furious
when he finds out.</i>

12:44.080 --> 12:46.241
He's going to make that noise.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.765
Oh, shit, that's him on the other line.
I've gotta go.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.285
Oh, wait, Monica, I just...

12:50.360 --> 12:51.771
Hi, Peter.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.204
Hello, Monica?

12:56.880 --> 12:59.087
Um, car? Mr. Car?

12:59.160 --> 13:00.525
Uh, excuse me.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.602
Arallon is an island, so how are we, um...

13:02.680 --> 13:04.330
Oh, no, no! No, no, no, no.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.243
Stop. Let me out.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.921
Um...

13:08.280 --> 13:10.123
Mmm. Um...

13:10.200 --> 13:11.440
Uh, that's not good.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.485
Oh, no! No!

13:13.560 --> 13:15.005
Excuse me, please!

13:16.720 --> 13:19.087
Please honk. Please honk.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.605
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.088
No, no. Please. Please.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.050
Oh, no, that's not good.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.129
Okay, Donald, stay calm.

13:34.680 --> 13:38.127
<i>103 hours to destination.
Entering sleep mode.</i>

13:38.200 --> 13:40.168
- What? <i>No!
- Enjoy your ride.</i>

13:40.240 --> 13:41.924
Okay, stay calm. Stay calm.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.604
Wait, my phone.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.923
No bars. No bars. No bars. No bars.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.531
"We bring thy garden, o mighty Lucifer,"

14:01.600 --> 14:05.525
"the fragrances which abound
therein, vapors of..."

14:05.600 --> 14:07.568
What the fuck are we doing here?

14:07.640 --> 14:09.290
Look at these fucking people.

14:09.360 --> 14:14.241
"...through this, the black flame
of Satan thou walkest in Hell.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.561
"The gates are flung wide

14:16.640 --> 14:19.723
"and thy passage is heralded
by the deathless cries

14:19.800 --> 14:21.689
"of his guardian beasts.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.284
"Breathe of his breath,
o brother of the night

14:25.360 --> 14:27.931
"and nourish his waning brain.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.923
- "From the despair..."
- I just figured it out.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.047
It all makes sense.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.167
Figured what out?

14:32.240 --> 14:36.211
Why Tara might be into you more than me.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.964
She's attracted to ugliness.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.042
- On, fuck you.
- No, think about it.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.330
This is the life that she chooses, right?
She's attracted to unattractiveness.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.085
Look at all these ugly people
and Gilfoyle and now you.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.130
That's ridiculous.
I'm way more attractive than you are.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.760
- No, you're not.
- Way better looking.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.088
By no metric could you possibly
be considered more attractive than me.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.323
You're saying that every woman
in the entire world

14:58.400 --> 15:00.402
would think you're more
attractive than I am?

15:00.480 --> 15:03.324
- Yes. Unless they're completely fucked up.
- That's fuck...

15:03.400 --> 15:04.401
Damn it.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.685
You doing okay there?

15:12.760 --> 15:14.728
Yep, yeah.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.165
Fine, just, you know,

15:16.240 --> 15:19.767
it's big orchestration stuff,
a lot of moving parts.

15:19.840 --> 15:23.003
Nothing you need to worry about.
You just focus on the cloud.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.844
I'm here if you need me.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.122
You know what? Uh...

15:45.200 --> 15:47.089
I know it's not what we hired you for,

15:47.160 --> 15:48.650
but I am actually having a little trouble

15:48.760 --> 15:51.525
with the data replication
in the persistence layer.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.046
Move over.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.203
Uh-huh.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.363
Oh, Christ.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.169
- I'm much more handsome than you are.
- No, my face is completely symmetrical.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.844
You know what my nickname
was when I was a kid?

16:06.920 --> 16:08.809
- What?
- Pakistani Denzel.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.041
You look nothing like him.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.521
Denzel Washington has a beautiful smile.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.681
You look ridiculous.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.650
Hail Satan, it is done.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.640
- Hail Satan.
- Hail Satan, it is...

16:19.680 --> 16:20.886
It's done.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.601
Well, thanks for coming, everyone.

16:26.680 --> 16:30.969
Brother Jason was kind enough
to furnish this week's food.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.088
It's Chick-fil-A.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.527
I know, they're on the Christian right,

16:35.640 --> 16:38.689
but darned if that chicken isn't good.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.081
- I think the Dark Lord would understand.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.041
Also... Ugh. A reminder.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.363
If you parked in the Sav-On parking lot,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.204
they do tow.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.603
Well, I didn't know if you wanted
original Oreos or Double Stuf

16:53.680 --> 16:55.603
so I went a little nutty and I got both.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.366
How's it, um...

16:57.440 --> 16:59.727
Fuck. Fuck.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.325
- Kevin?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.566
Hello?

17:05.760 --> 17:07.090
Fuck.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.049
What are you doing down here?

17:09.119 --> 17:12.521
I did it again, I did it again.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.284
- Did what?
- I did it again.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.171
No.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.531
What is this?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.767
Did you overwrite the data schema?

17:23.680 --> 17:25.921
Why would you do this?
You don't ever do this!

17:26.000 --> 17:28.570
That's exactly what they said
when I was working at BofA.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.042
Working at BofA? I thought you hacked in.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.167
No.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.569
I was a consultant
at the retail banking services.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.290
I crashed their entire system.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.966
It took a team of seven engineers
more than a week

17:42.080 --> 17:44.367
to comb through all the code
and find my mistake.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.602
And the only way that
I ever avoided being sued

17:46.680 --> 17:49.968
was by agreeing to never tell anyone
that I worked there.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.285
Oh, fuck.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.010
Oh, fuck, what?

17:55.080 --> 17:58.323
I just told you. Now I
could get in trouble.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.080
Trouble?

18:00.160 --> 18:02.561
You just skull-fucked my whole system.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.280
I am going to punch you in the fucking...

18:04.320 --> 18:06.641
We don't like sacrifice goats or anything.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.961
We're not like
the Order of the Golden Dawners, you know.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.002
Yeah.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.010
Richard, are you okay?

18:13.120 --> 18:15.088
Um... Mmm...

18:15.200 --> 18:18.647
Dinesh, uh, we may have a slight problem.

18:18.720 --> 18:22.441
The Carver just carved
up our entire platform.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.360
What the fuck?

18:24.440 --> 18:26.727
Yeah, the database layers,
the application layers,

18:26.800 --> 18:28.609
even the chef scripts are fucked.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.809
The little fucker must have hacked
into the DDL tables like he did with BofA.

18:31.920 --> 18:35.288
He didn't hack into BofA.
He was consulting there at the time,

18:35.360 --> 18:37.601
when he took down the system by accident.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.802
- Oh, you told them too?
- What the fuck?

18:39.880 --> 18:43.771
Richard, why would you let that
little fetus access the DDL?

18:43.840 --> 18:47.322
Because I thought
that fetus was better than me

18:47.400 --> 18:49.004
and so did you and everybody

18:49.080 --> 18:51.287
and you just, you pressured me
into hiring him...

18:51.400 --> 18:53.971
Yes, Richard, for the cloud,
to deploy the cloud.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.769
So that you could do what you do best

18:55.840 --> 18:59.526
and concentrate on everything else
which the fetus just fucked up.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.284
You need to drag this little shit stain...

19:01.360 --> 19:02.486
You hear that?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.130
Out from under this table
and have him go through

19:04.200 --> 19:05.929
every single line of code with you

19:06.040 --> 19:08.247
to unfuck it while it's still unfuckable.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.601
I should not have eaten
all of that Satanist chicken.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.490
Okay, and with this one here,
did you delete it

19:18.560 --> 19:19.925
or just move it?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.201
Hello? Kevin.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.850
Maybe. I don't know.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.924
What? What does that mean?
What's wrong with you, man?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.890
I can't focus. I'm out of Adderall.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.561
Where's that Jared guy?
He was getting my refill.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.484
That's actually a really good question.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.925
I don't know where he is.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.801
The Carver's Adderall prescription.
I hope that's not a problem.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.451
Dead battery.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.601
That's a problem.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.531
I need to lay down.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.125
What? No!

20:01.200 --> 20:03.168
You said you could code
for 48 hours straight.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.401
That's like your thing.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.086
Yeah, how the fuck do you think I do that?
Adderall.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.003
Well, we don't have any.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.610
It's really bright in here.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.604
Who takes Adderall anymore?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.282
Half the kids in Palo Alto.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.491
Hey-

20:22.320 --> 20:25.210
Any of you guys currently on Adderall

20:25.280 --> 20:29.444
and, uh, you know, want to make $50?

20:53.680 --> 20:55.011
Oh, boy.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.803
What do you mean, it's not Adderall?
It's Adderall!

20:58.880 --> 21:01.360
I know what Adderall looks like.
It's not Adderall.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.441
Uh...

21:09.520 --> 21:11.522
Excuse me. Caleb?

21:12.360 --> 21:14.522
There's been some kind of mistake.

21:14.760 --> 21:18.446
What you sold me was not actually Adderall.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.760
So maybe we could...

21:19.880 --> 21:21.882
Do you think you could get me
some real Adderall?

21:21.960 --> 21:23.405
Yeah, yeah, of course.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.801
Um...

21:24.880 --> 21:26.405
I could do that or, um...

21:26.480 --> 21:28.369
I can give you some of this.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.010
Ow!

21:31.080 --> 21:32.445
Okay, I'm gonna...

21:32.560 --> 21:35.370
You're gonna do what, bitch?
Call the cops on me?

21:35.480 --> 21:38.290
Tell them you got the wrong
illegal drugs from a kid?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.165
You dumb piece of shit.
Get the fuck out of here.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.890
- Uh, you...
- Run!

21:42.960 --> 21:45.247
- All right, I'm running.
- Keep running!

22:24.760 --> 22:26.569
Stupid...

22:28.520 --> 22:30.363
Richard, what's wrong?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.284
Have you been crying?

22:34.840 --> 22:37.161
Hey! Which one was it?

22:37.560 --> 22:39.164
It was Church Candy, wasn't it?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.129
You just brought piss to a shit fight,
you little cunt!

22:41.360 --> 22:42.361
Ow!

22:44.120 --> 22:45.929
No, no, no!

22:46.000 --> 22:49.209
Now you get in your fucking house
and you get me five Adderall

22:49.280 --> 22:51.521
or I'll slit your fucking throat!
You understand?

22:51.640 --> 22:53.722
I'll kill your mother!
I'll rape your father!

22:53.800 --> 22:56.121
I'll curb-stomp that little face so hard

22:56.200 --> 22:58.931
that your teeth will go
flying, you little shit!

22:59.000 --> 23:00.365
Now go! Go! Go! Go!

23:00.480 --> 23:03.000
- Get me five Adderall, right now!
- Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

23:16.640 --> 23:18.210
- Hi.
- Tara.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.684
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.005
First of all...

23:24.880 --> 23:26.450
So, um...

23:28.640 --> 23:31.803
I have thought about it. A lot.

23:32.880 --> 23:37.363
To be honest, elements of this arrangement
still trouble me.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.961
However, I have not had
a lot of sexual experiences.

23:44.040 --> 23:48.170
So I feel it may be foolish
to turn this down.

23:49.880 --> 23:54.647
So as long as Gilfoyle is not in the room

23:54.720 --> 23:58.202
and I can verify that the door is locked

24:00.120 --> 24:02.441
then I have concluded that,

24:04.360 --> 24:06.362
yes,

24:06.440 --> 24:11.526
I would love to have
sexual relations with you,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.001
Tara.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.521
Yeah.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.201
Uh, what are you talking about?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.371
Gilfoyle told me.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.328
I know you want to have sex with me.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.246
Gilfoyle?

24:27.840 --> 24:29.842
Would you come in here for a second?

24:30.480 --> 24:31.481
Um...

24:31.640 --> 24:32.880
Um...

24:33.560 --> 24:37.042
Did you tell Dinesh that
I want to have sex with him?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.561
No.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.765
Oh, wait, yeah, I totally did.
I forgot about that.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.808
I was really high. I was
just fucking with him.

24:46.920 --> 24:47.967
Did he believe me?

24:48.840 --> 24:49.841
Uh...

24:49.920 --> 24:52.048
Did you just present yourself to my woman?

24:52.120 --> 24:53.121
Uh...

24:55.520 --> 24:57.204
Oh, this is outstanding.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.608
Oh, my God, that is so mean of you!

25:00.880 --> 25:02.609
Look at how cute he is.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.929
He's adorable. You're adorable.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.085
Don't call me... It's very emasculating.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.684
What kind of fucking idiot
listens to what Gilfoyle has to say?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.048
Okay, Tara, here's what it is.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.208
If you can tell me to my face

25:19.280 --> 25:21.851
that you seriously find Dinesh
more attractive than me,

25:21.920 --> 25:24.605
then and only then will I concede defeat.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.281
What?

25:36.800 --> 25:38.723
And our regression test is...

25:38.800 --> 25:39.847
Done.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.890
Yes. It's clear, we all test out.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.088
- The system's stable again.
- Thank God.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.130
Now we can move on to the next module
and I can forget you ever existed.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.567
Can you do me a favor?

25:52.720 --> 25:55.121
Don't tell anyone I cratered this bad.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.360
I won't tell anyone I hired you
if you won't tell anyone you worked here.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.564
Oh, the BofA deal. Got it.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.010
Well, I'm gonna call my mom
and have her pick me up.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.570
Your mom?

26:06.640 --> 26:08.927
Oh, by the way, you owe me $20,000.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.765
What a dick.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.648
You have to talk to Jared about that.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.006
Where is Jared?

26:35.640 --> 26:37.847
Excuse me. Can you help me?

26:39.680 --> 26:41.728
<i>Obstacle averted.
Resuming operations.</i>

26:42.480 --> 26:44.005
<i>Please be careful.</i>

26:53.880 --> 26:56.963
<i>- Please be careful.
- Please be careful.</i>

27:11.280 --> 27:12.281
Okay.
