11:17.041 --> 11:18.375
I don't know, man.

11:18.458 --> 11:21.166
They might end up just shutting
us all down, bathhouses.

11:21.249 --> 11:22.541
Back rooms, too.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.958
Who knows, you know,
maybe that'd be better,

11:25.041 --> 11:26.750
you know, for...

11:26.833 --> 11:29.458
prevention. You know, safety.

11:29.541 --> 11:32.166
I say keep the fucking
where you can see it.

11:32.249 --> 11:34.625
Talk to people, teach 'em
what works, what doesn't work.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.124
Don't just close down
the buildings.

11:36.208 --> 11:37.625
Buildings don't make people
fucking sick.

11:37.708 --> 11:39.999
You know, see,
you're smart about this.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.625
Maybe you should run for office.

11:41.708 --> 11:43.166
For what? Town whore?

11:43.249 --> 11:44.375
You'd be a shoe-in.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.750
-Fuck you. (LAUGHS)
-(LAUGHS)

11:48.792 --> 11:51.166
But, uh... you're okay, right?

11:51.249 --> 11:54.333
Me? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure. I'm good.

11:55.291 --> 11:56.291
Okay.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.583
-All right, Paul.
-Yeah, good to see you.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.708
-SEAN: Nice. Very nice.
-PORN ACTRESS: 'Kay. Hang on!

12:03.792 --> 12:05.458
SEAN: Carl, swing over to Roy.

12:05.541 --> 12:07.291
-He's got his line coming up.
-Service!

12:07.375 --> 12:09.041
PORN ACTRESS #2:
Ooh! Thanks, Tyra!

12:09.124 --> 12:10.875
SEAN: Angylene, keep doing
what you're doing. That's great.

12:10.958 --> 12:13.041
Kimmy, lean over Roy
a little more.

12:13.124 --> 12:17.124
I want your tits right
in his face. There you go.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.667
Okay, Roy.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.458
Oh, it's so wrong.

12:21.124 --> 12:23.166
But so right.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.625
SEAN: Lori, cheat forward.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.583
Yes.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.333
Mike, assume the position.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.375
-(GAGS)
-Closer.

12:46.625 --> 12:49.166
Let me show you how we do it
in Iowa.

12:51.458 --> 12:53.500
What? No, no!
We're gonna have to cut.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.583
-No.
-Cut, cut, cu-- What is it?

12:55.667 --> 12:57.750
Uh, no gag. I don't do gags.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.041
And what's with the corn?

12:59.124 --> 13:01.708
He's your hick cousin.
From the sticks.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.583
-So he brought corn?
-Yeah.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.958
-Just go with it.
-Can I talk to you for a minute?

13:17.166 --> 13:18.625
He was going for my ass.

13:18.708 --> 13:21.041
So what?
You cleaned, right?

13:21.541 --> 13:22.625
(SCOFFS)

13:22.708 --> 13:24.958
Lori, we're paying you rate
for anal.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.958
Not with vegetables, you're not.

13:27.041 --> 13:28.375
Did you clear this with Kiki?

13:28.458 --> 13:29.917
I don't clear every scene
with your agent.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.416
Well, maybe you should.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.625
It's my name on the box
that sells your product.

13:33.708 --> 13:36.124
I'm Lori fucking Madison. I'm
not some bimbo who's willing to
do anything

13:36.208 --> 13:38.958
just to be in a movie.
Okay, I am the fucking movie.
Now, you're telling me

13:39.041 --> 13:40.999
I have to shove produce
up my ass?

13:41.083 --> 13:43.041
-Lori--
-And who the fuck is that?

13:46.500 --> 13:47.999
He owns the house.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.124
Gets to watch.

13:50.208 --> 13:53.375
Fuck you. Fuck him.
Where's the phone?

14:00.166 --> 14:02.291
Hey! Sh-Sh-Sh-Shay!

14:05.041 --> 14:06.458
You okay?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.208
Is Rodney here?

14:08.291 --> 14:09.750
Rodney?

14:09.833 --> 14:12.999
No, wait-- You got a ginger ale?

14:13.083 --> 14:14.708
Yeah, sure, hon. Come sit down.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.583
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:24.458 --> 14:25.917
ABBY PARKER: Can I make you
something hot?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.208
Uh-- just-- just this, thanks.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.625
It's good.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.458
My mother believed
in ginger ale. A cure-all.

14:37.541 --> 14:38.792
(CHUCKLES)

14:38.875 --> 14:41.458
"Ma, I got a cold."
"Drink ginger ale."

14:41.541 --> 14:44.375
"Ma, my foot hurts."
"Drink ginger ale."

14:44.458 --> 14:46.458
"Ma, I got run over
by a lawn mower."

14:46.541 --> 14:49.708
"Drink ging--"
(COUGHS VIOLENTLY)

14:49.792 --> 14:51.792
Come on, Shay. Please sit down.

14:57.083 --> 14:58.291
I'm okay.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.333
Just need a second.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.625
Could-- Could I have some more?

15:08.999 --> 15:11.625
Why don't you finish
this one first, huh?

15:11.708 --> 15:12.792
(SHAY SIGHS)

15:12.875 --> 15:14.667
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

15:21.541 --> 15:25.667
And the image keeps coming back.
It's like a theme or...

15:25.750 --> 15:27.291
like a motif, I guess.

15:27.375 --> 15:30.166
And I want there to be
a really intense point of view,

15:30.249 --> 15:31.917
so I'm building that
into the script.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.333
And I'm gonna write this one
myself.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.917
I'm gonna try.

15:36.999 --> 15:40.083
I've been talkin' to the girls.
I've been hearing their stories.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.625
-Eileen, I--
-Yeah?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.750
Well, I don't want to interrupt
your conceptualizing.

15:43.833 --> 15:47.750
-No.
-Uh, I want to reiterate...

15:47.833 --> 15:51.291
I'm not funding this one.
I am not kidding.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.750
I can't be on this ride
with you.

15:53.833 --> 15:57.458
Have I asked you for anything?
I don't want your money, Harvey.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.833
What I want is your ear.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.541
Or can I not bounce an idea
off you now?

16:01.625 --> 16:04.333
HARVEY WASSERMAN: No, of course.
I'm sorry. Bounce away.

16:04.416 --> 16:08.958
B-- wait. First, just--
I need a favor.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.958
And it's money for both of us.
Right?

16:11.041 --> 16:13.208
You still need to pay the rent,
right?

16:13.291 --> 16:16.625
So... we're shooting tonight.
Tony flaked.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.792
He checked himself
into fucking rehab.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.625
You gotta cover.

16:20.708 --> 16:22.333
You g-- you hav-- please.

16:22.416 --> 16:23.917
It's a couple scenes. Here.

16:23.999 --> 16:28.833
Only scenes outstanding
are self-pleasure in a bathtub

16:28.917 --> 16:32.999
and principals straight fucking
while French maid looks on.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.333
And then does the maid
join them?

16:36.124 --> 16:37.249
What are the chances?

16:37.333 --> 16:38.625
WOMAN: H.W. International Films.

16:38.708 --> 16:41.333
-Genius.
-WOMAN: How can I help you?

16:41.416 --> 16:43.999
How'd you ever come up
with that plot pivot?

16:44.083 --> 16:49.166
Fuck, Harvey, all this talk
about your film appreciation.

16:49.249 --> 16:53.875
French New Wave, fucking Godard,
Charbroil, it's all talk.

16:53.958 --> 16:56.416
-It's Chabrol. It's Chabrol.
-Yeah.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.041
I know it's Chabrol.
I'm making a fucking joke.

16:59.124 --> 17:01.583
You lose your sense of humor
when you lost your soul?

17:01.667 --> 17:03.792
That's-- Hey, Eileen,
that's not fair.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.208
That's not fair.

17:07.750 --> 17:11.083
No, no, no, no. Stay.
Here, stay.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.166
Talk about your movie.

17:13.249 --> 17:16.291
You are a fucking sellout.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.792
Lor, I got girls in my office
right now who'll do this

17:29.875 --> 17:33.249
in a heartbeat and shoot popcorn
out of their ass to boot.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.500
LORI MADISON: What about
that creepy shit watching?
I don't like it.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.541
Babe, you're just gonna have to
grin and bear it for now. Okay?

17:38.625 --> 17:41.208
LORI: I didn't agree
to any of this.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.500
Lori, I need you to be
a team player.

17:44.583 --> 17:48.208
Sean Howard is the hottest
director working right now,

17:48.291 --> 17:50.041
and this is how he rolls.

17:50.124 --> 17:53.708
This is an important gig, okay?

17:53.792 --> 17:54.792
Fuck, Kiki!

18:15.291 --> 18:18.958
(GRUNTS) Just don't tell
Aunt Sharon.

18:19.041 --> 18:20.875
And cut.

18:20.958 --> 18:22.667
Roy, keep the wood.

18:24.667 --> 18:25.999

sign there.

Abby Parker, I need to see
Dr. Wells if she's in.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.458
She's here, but unless you have
an appointment--

18:41.541 --> 18:43.083
Get her on the phone
and tell her

18:43.166 --> 18:45.208
that Abby is in the waiting area
and she has someone

18:45.291 --> 18:47.041
who needs her assistance
right now.

Abby?

18:48.958 --> 18:50.375
Abby with the envelopes.

to reception?

-That's great. Thank you.

It's bronchitis.
I get it every winter.

19:11.249 --> 19:16.458
I got ya hot tea... and a roll.

19:16.541 --> 19:18.708
Thought you were gonna make me
chicken soup.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.249
I can run to the deli.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.166
I'm shitting you.

I don't know this, but...

what's your last name?

Brody.

19:30.583 --> 19:31.583
Brody.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.541
It's-- It's Lila, actually.

19:42.416 --> 19:44.291
Lila Brody.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.333
Yeah, nice Jewish girl.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.249

your own damn chicken soup.

VINCENT: So, what
you're telling me

20:01.458 --> 20:03.708
is that you're having problems
with your people.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.291
RUDY PIPILO: Not personally, no.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.875
But the organization
is in, like, disarray.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.625
So, you good with them?

20:11.999 --> 20:13.416
I never see the big guy.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.249
He don't come out
of that castle.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.541
Built out on Staten Island
with the columns and marble...

20:18.625 --> 20:22.999
and the... silk dressing gowns
like fucking Liberace.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.375
Fucks his maid with his wife
in the next room.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.875
I mean, that's the mother
of your kids. Show some respect.

20:28.958 --> 20:29.999
Yeah.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.792
I don't know.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.667
I don't think he's gonna last.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.458
So, what will happen if he goes?

20:38.541 --> 20:41.458
Gotti and them,
they'll make a play.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.375
They're animals.

20:43.458 --> 20:46.208
And what's all this have to do
with me?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.458
They're gonna start taking
15 percent

20:48.541 --> 20:49.833
from us instead of ten.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.625
So, I need you to work harder,
Vincent.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.792
More promotions in the clubs.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.999
Whatever you gotta do
in the parlors and the peeps

20:57.083 --> 20:58.249
to increase revenue.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.333
About all that, Rudy.
You know...

21:01.667 --> 21:04.500
On Paul's side of things,
there's this sickness.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.708
You know, he's not stealin'.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.375
He's light 'cause he's light.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.583
Yeah, I know. That's some
frightening shit going on.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.208
But Paul aside...

21:13.291 --> 21:15.249
Yeah, I'll do my best, Rudy.

21:15.333 --> 21:16.875
RUDY: I know you will.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.166
-So, you got a new car.
-Yeah.

21:21.249 --> 21:22.833
Eighty-five Mark.

21:24.291 --> 21:26.124
What's with the phone?

21:27.500 --> 21:28.792
It was an option.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.958
I mean, I could never talk
business on this thing,

21:33.041 --> 21:34.375
but shit, I had to have it.

21:36.750 --> 21:40.667
So, this one... owns this one...

21:40.750 --> 21:43.917
who's doing business
as this one.

21:43.999 --> 21:47.458
Until this one...
why is this so complicated?

21:47.541 --> 21:50.041
We're not used to this process
exactly.

21:50.124 --> 21:51.833
In the past, we haven't
typically pursued

21:51.917 --> 21:53.458
-the building owners.
-Why not?

21:53.541 --> 21:57.875
Because in America, constable,
property is sacred.

21:57.958 --> 22:01.333
Historically, we don't wanna
touch the real estate.

22:01.416 --> 22:03.083
We've gone after legal entities,

22:03.166 --> 22:04.792
running businesses
within the buildings.

22:04.875 --> 22:07.500
Unless the owners were a party
to the illicit operation.

22:07.583 --> 22:09.291
But now we covet the property.

22:09.375 --> 22:12.917
Well, we don't. But finally,
there are people who do,

22:12.999 --> 22:14.750
and there's money
to lure them in.

22:15.999 --> 22:17.541
One point seven billion

22:17.625 --> 22:19.917
-for the 42nd Street
Development Fund.
-That's right.

22:20.541 --> 22:23.083
So... dig deep.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.750
DR. KAREN WELLS: I don't know
how she's still standing.

22:28.833 --> 22:32.291
She's got fluid in her lungs,
raging throat infection.

22:32.375 --> 22:34.792

32:57.291 --> 32:58.958
All right, well then get 'em
in order.

32:59.041 --> 33:02.333
I can't do it.
Ain't my boys.

33:02.416 --> 33:04.291
Anyway, nobody asked me
for my vote

33:04.375 --> 33:05.958
when they passed
the padlock law.

33:06.041 --> 33:07.416
I can only do so much
for you now.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.500
Then what the fuck
am I paying you for, huh?

33:09.583 --> 33:12.166
I'm sorry, Vince. I'm sorry.

33:12.249 --> 33:13.917
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

you're sealed with the gift

33:22.249 --> 33:23.750
-of the Holy Spirit.
-CONFIRMEE: Amen.

33:23.833 --> 33:25.625
-Peace be with you.
-CONFIRMEE: And also with you.

33:26.750 --> 33:28.458
You smell nice.

33:28.541 --> 33:31.124
Thank you. I always smell nice
for church.

33:31.208 --> 33:33.583
That the father that took
your virginity? Gray hair.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.708
BISHOP: We seal with a gift
to the Holy Spirit.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.917
-The gray haired one.
-BISHOP: Peace be with you.

33:37.999 --> 33:39.667
He's shitting bricks.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.291
Told him the bishop's gotta slap
his face.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.291
The hell you tell him that for?

33:44.375 --> 33:46.583
-To fuck with him.
-Shh!

33:49.083 --> 33:50.750
BISHOP: Peter,
you're sealed with the gift

33:50.833 --> 33:52.625
of the Holy Spirit.

33:52.708 --> 33:55.249
-Peace be with you.
-(WHISPERS) Here we go.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.500
-I present Luke.
-BISHOP: Luke,

33:57.583 --> 33:59.583
you're sealed with
the gift of the Holy Spirit.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.708
-Amen.
-BISHOP: Peace be with you.

(HEART MONITOR BEEPS)

34:28.249 --> 34:30.291

you should have stuck with us.

-Who?
-(LORETTA SIGHS)

34:33.958 --> 34:35.291
Women Against Porn.

34:35.375 --> 34:38.583
Loretta, I helped kickstart
the whole fucking thing.

34:38.667 --> 34:40.625
To add to the irony,
I did it with half a dozen

34:40.708 --> 34:42.958
-of the parlor envelopes.
-I know. I was there.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.416
Yeah, when I did it,
it was informational.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.541
It was about awareness.

34:47.625 --> 34:49.750
It wasn't a goddamn
frontal assault

34:49.833 --> 34:51.750
on the freedom of speech.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.291
Dworkin, MacKinnon,
what they're doing

34:54.375 --> 34:56.625
with the censorship stuff.
The city ordinances

34:56.708 --> 34:58.583
and now they're trying to get
in bed with Reagan, Meese,

34:58.667 --> 35:00.041
-and those fucking shitheads.
-So what?

35:00.124 --> 35:01.750
Now it's not about marching
around,

35:01.833 --> 35:04.249
leading housewives
from Scarsdale around the Deuce

35:04.333 --> 35:07.541
for show-me tours.
Now, they're changing shit.

35:07.625 --> 35:10.208
How? By trashing
the First Amendment?

35:10.291 --> 35:12.958
The First Amendment isn't
about fuck movies, Abby.

35:13.041 --> 35:15.541
It's about important things.
Ideas and shit.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.249
If you don't use it
for the fuck films,

35:17.333 --> 35:20.208
it's not gonna be there
for the ideas.

35:20.291 --> 35:22.375
-The problem with these--
-Hey.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.750
You bitches do go on.

Hey, you did good.
Didn't I tell ya you'd do good?

35:42.208 --> 35:45.500
You take that.
Don't show your mother.

35:45.583 --> 35:47.999
-Say thank you, Patrick.
-Thank you.

Nothin', huh?

That's who you choose
for a sponsor over me?

35:54.667 --> 35:57.249
What are you talkin' about?
Helped him pick his name.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.625
Helped him say his prayers,
didn't I, Paddy-o?

35:59.708 --> 36:01.333
-No.
-What?

36:01.416 --> 36:02.625
Well, you did good anyway.

36:02.708 --> 36:05.166
You made your grandpa
very proud.

36:05.249 --> 36:07.917
Hey, Dad. I've been meaning
to talk to you.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.750
I got this bachelor party
coming up, guy from work.

36:11.833 --> 36:13.833
We're gonna rent a suite
at the Milford.

36:13.917 --> 36:15.833
I wanted to get some girls
up there.

36:15.917 --> 36:17.541
You know, just to dance
and shit.

36:17.625 --> 36:19.875
I thought, uh--
I thought maybe from the parlor.

36:19.958 --> 36:21.458
Sounds like a pain in my ass.

36:22.083 --> 36:23.208
Won't be cheap.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.249
We'll talk.

36:25.333 --> 36:28.333
Bobby. Bob-- we going?

36:28.416 --> 36:30.833
Frannie, Uncle Nicky says
we gotta go in your car.

36:30.917 --> 36:32.999
Ah, she's driving me
frickin' nuts.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.500
Okay, Mama.

36:34.583 --> 36:37.416
All right. Joey, you're coming
with me.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.249
But you're putting money away?

36:41.124 --> 36:42.500
Kinda.

36:42.583 --> 36:46.249
Look, I can say this to you.
You know how to hear it.

36:46.333 --> 36:48.291
This thing doesn't last
forever.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.375
Not for anyone. Not for you.

36:51.458 --> 36:53.416
With the reputation
you're getting now.

36:53.500 --> 36:57.291
Reputation because I didn't want
a corn cob shoved up my ass?

36:57.375 --> 36:58.875
It's not just that. Come on.

36:58.958 --> 37:00.917
Why don't you try sending me out
for some actual legit work?

37:00.999 --> 37:02.375
I can do other stuff, you know.

37:02.458 --> 37:03.958
I don't have those contacts.

37:04.041 --> 37:06.249
Make some calls.
This is Hollywood, right?

37:06.333 --> 37:08.750
You're on the other side
of the hill from Hollywood,

37:08.833 --> 37:10.500
in case you didn't notice.

37:10.583 --> 37:13.458
You want straight film work,
you need a straight agent.

37:13.541 --> 37:15.833
I'm not gonna lie to you
about who I am or what I bring.

37:15.917 --> 37:17.667
I thought you were on my side.

37:18.541 --> 37:20.792
I am on your side.

LORI: Mm.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.249
Which is why I want you
to go in there

37:25.333 --> 37:28.083
and say yes to everything.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.833
This is Vibrance.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.750
Traci Lords did like
a dozen titles

37:32.833 --> 37:36.999
with them last year. The whole
"Best of Lori Madison" thing...

37:37.083 --> 37:40.083
doesn't happen without this.

37:40.166 --> 37:44.416
It's your shot. So, go finish
this Sean Howard movie,

37:44.500 --> 37:46.833
and finish strong.

-Good.

Yeah, you know,
the trading floor,

38:20.958 --> 38:22.833
you need elbows
so I fit right in.

38:22.917 --> 38:25.083
Some of the other guys,
they went to college--

38:25.166 --> 38:27.999
I don't know, they're smart,
but not street smart.

38:28.083 --> 38:29.124
Gives me an edge.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.166
-Well, good. Good.
-Yeah.

38:31.249 --> 38:33.999
-Hey, Bob, right?
-How are you? Nice to see you.

38:35.583 --> 38:38.083
So... think you might want
to invest?

38:38.166 --> 38:40.708
I mean, if I get like a tip.

38:40.792 --> 38:43.833
No. Your Uncle Frankie
is a gambler. Not me.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.875
Well, it wouldn't really be
a gamble if you catch my drift.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.166

even being a smart ass.

-Don't believe a word he says.
He's so crooked, you know...
-All right.

into the grave.

a hologram machine.

As if he ain't got enough
already.

41:15.041 --> 41:16.458
How do you know this?

41:16.541 --> 41:18.750
Guy called me. DiBernardo
made a side deal

41:18.833 --> 41:21.124
with one of my people.
Right under my nose.

41:21.208 --> 41:23.583
-Who?
-RUDY: Some asshole,
don't matter.

41:23.667 --> 41:25.999
I don't even know how
he got to the kid.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.708
Point is, he should be
bouncing it back to me.

41:28.792 --> 41:32.124
-I'm owed, Carmine.
-So take it outta your guy.

41:32.208 --> 41:34.875
I gotta pee.
My fucking prostrate, man.

41:36.083 --> 41:38.708

on that team the other day.

42:05.583 --> 42:09.625

of keeping you humble.

42:17.750 --> 42:20.792
Guess that-- that's where
the money is.
