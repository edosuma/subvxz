00:34.367 --> 00:38.371
-

00:50.091 --> 00:53.928
From now on, I'm to be apprised
of all matters here, Prime Minister.

00:54.971 --> 00:59.601
Scrappers on Bracca reported
a power surge on a Jedi cruiser.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.102
Send a scout team.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.063
We'll need more than that.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.899
It's Clone Force 99.

01:05.982 --> 01:08.026
Admiral Rampart,

01:08.109 --> 01:12.989
the clones of experimental unit 99
are highly skilled assets.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.201
It would be most beneficial
to have them returned alive.

01:16.284 --> 01:19.579
I have no interest
in a group of rogue clone deserters.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.999
If you find them on Bracca,
terminate them.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.972
And that's how you disassemble
a thermal explosive.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.184
There's tons of live ordnance buried
in this shipyard.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.521
If you trip one,
you need to know how to disable it.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.898
Seems simple enough.

01:46.981 --> 01:51.695
Well, if you're so sure, here. Disarm it.

01:51.778 --> 01:55.824
-Me? But I only watched you once--
-Ten seconds till we're both goners.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.202
-Ten, nine…
-The conductor feeds the coil expander.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.204
-…eight…
-This connects to the transmitter.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.288
-…seven…
-Then what?

02:03.039 --> 02:04.374
…six,

02:05.083 --> 02:08.044
-five, four…
-

02:08.128 --> 02:13.883
-I don't know which wire to cut next.
-Better get it right. Three, two, one!

02:13.967 --> 02:15.969
-Obviously not that one.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.303
Too late! Run for it!

02:24.728 --> 02:27.522
Gotcha.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.775
Why didn't it explode?
-Ha!

02:30.859 --> 02:33.278
Because it's a smoke bomb.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.322
You think I'd let you train
with a live explosive?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.202
You should've seen your face.

02:41.286 --> 02:45.582
Wrecker, Omega, pack it in.
Hunter wants us back at the Jedi cruiser.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.211
How'd the test go?

02:50.295 --> 02:51.629
I don't wanna talk about it.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.256
Cheer up, kid.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.176
I failed my first disarming test too.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.429
With my help, you'll be a pro in no time.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.484
We've got eyes on us.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.486
Yeah, I see 'em.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.570
How many?

03:15.653 --> 03:18.490
At least three. Stay casual.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.076
Wrecker, you ready?

03:21.576 --> 03:23.036
Waiting on you.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.084
Stop!

03:31.294 --> 03:32.921
Oh, no you don't.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.050
-Whoa! I've got this under control.
- Hunter, Tech.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.760
We were spotted by scrappers.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.388
Wrecker's in pursuit.
He says he has it under control.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.847
That's not comforting.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.557
-Echo, get a visual.
-I'm on it.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.980
-

04:05.495 --> 04:07.747
Are you okay?

04:07.831 --> 04:11.710
I-- I was just waiting to make my move.

04:16.631 --> 04:19.801
Rex warned us
about the scrapper patrols on Bracca.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.969
We should leave.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.888
In our present situation, we need money.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.641
And we have a chance
to make a lot of it right here.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.477
Ha! In this dump? How?

04:29.561 --> 04:33.023
Tech, what's the potential haul
inside this cruiser?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.232
My scans indicate

04:34.315 --> 04:37.402
the armory and artillery bay
have not been fully off-loaded.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.571
The dianoga must have kept
the scrappers away.

04:40.155 --> 04:44.159
Just a few of those weapons
should clear our debt with Cid.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.494
We're soldiers, not arms smugglers.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.206
There's no Republic
for us to rely on anymore.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.210
We're presented with an opportunity here.
We have to take it.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.756
I would also add that the intel
from the bridge's central system

04:57.839 --> 05:00.592
has the potential
to be worth far more than any weapon.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.510
Not to me.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.095
Tech, get to the bridge.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.848
Get the power online
and whatever intel you can gather.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.476
Uh, what do we do about them?

05:09.559 --> 05:12.479
We'll grab what we need
and be gone before they even wake up.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.612
-

05:39.422 --> 05:41.716
-

05:43.134 --> 05:45.679
Wrecker, you're gonna like this.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.640
Oh, yeah.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.892
Wow.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.145
You think that's great, check this out.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.864
- The power's back on.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.533
Yeah, we can see that.

06:14.874 --> 06:20.255
Whoa! So many proton torpedoes.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.799
Come here, beautiful.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.844
Can you show me how to arm that?

06:25.927 --> 06:28.513
-Sorry, kid. This one's all mine.
-

06:28.596 --> 06:30.432
Omega, I need you up on the bridge.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.599
Copy that.

06:34.936 --> 06:39.357
With a haul like this,
Cid will owe us for a change.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.819
If we'd left with Rex,
we wouldn't have to owe Cid at all.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.114
He's on a different path than us.

06:46.197 --> 06:50.452
Hunter, we're soldiers.
What other path is there?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.337
-

07:07.385 --> 07:09.179
-How's it looking?
- We're in luck.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.183
Whoever scuttled this ship
didn't wipe the hardware's data imprint.

07:13.266 --> 07:17.937
I'm transferring the files,
but I still need to copy the master drive.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.564
It's under that panel.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.660
Tech… what was the war like?

07:32.744 --> 07:37.123
It was a primary mission objective
comprised of battles on various fronts.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.125
But what was it like?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.294
Hmm? I just told you.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.215
Why is this button blinking?

07:50.011 --> 07:51.471
That's the proximity sensor.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.598
It signals when there's
an approaching vessel.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.643
It's most likely a short circuit.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.232
-Hunter, we've got company.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.531
Is it more scrappers?

08:09.614 --> 08:11.449
No, it's the Empire.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.207
Prime Minister.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.334
We can no longer delay.

08:21.418 --> 08:26.297
The Empire's mission on Bracca poses
a threat to our contingency plan.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.300
I will have to call upon
further assistance.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.052
Is that wise?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.472
We already have someone handling matters.

08:34.556 --> 08:38.852
As long as one of these bounty hunters
deliver the young clone intact,

08:38.935 --> 08:41.146
that is all that should concern us.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.740
It's Crosshair, all right.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.826
He won't be able to detect us.
I'm blocking their scanners.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.245
That won't stop him. Come on.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.671
That cruiser's where
the power surge was detected.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.298
Any life signs on board?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.258
Can't tell.
The scanner's not working.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.302
There's too much atmospheric interference.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.597
No, you're being jammed.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.850
They're still on board.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.271
Take a shuttle and find their ship.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.356
Yes, Commander.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.456
How many troopers we talking about?

09:41.539 --> 09:42.874
Three attack shuttles' worth.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.919
We already got what we came for.
Let's get to the Marauder.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.297
They're already on board
the cruiser. We need a covert way out.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.301
They'll do a forward-to-aft sweep.
We can alternate corridors. Come on.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.932
-[comm beeps]
-[CT-8508] Commander.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.183
What is it?

10:02.310 --> 10:05.105
We found their ship.
There's no one inside.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.649
-Secure the perimeter.
-Yes, sir.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.405
Talk to me, Tech.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.492
I'm trying to tap into the regs' comms
so we can monitor their movements.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.039
Someone's coming.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.395
I'm in.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.647
All squads.
- Yes, sir.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.858
Push the targets towards the hangar.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.443
-We'll pin them down.
-Roger that.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.653
-Aren't we headed to the hangar?

10:54.446 --> 10:57.157
Not anymore.
We'll cut through the artillery deck.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.137
Uh…

11:20.138 --> 11:23.224
Okay, I'm not going out that way.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.476
There they are.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.896
Stand down.

11:32.609 --> 11:36.821
Tapping our comms to track our movements?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.490
So predictable.

11:38.573 --> 11:41.534
Nice to see you too, Crosshair.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.789
Echo, scomp in and reroute
reserve power to the cannons.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.958
If these cannons fire,
this whole deck will collapse.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.212
Exactly.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.924
Look at you all, scavenging like rats.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.593
How pathetic.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.178
Why come after us?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.013
You're traitors.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.474
Move into position.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.146
Done.
-

12:10.689 --> 12:12.816
Crosshair, wake up.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.985
You're being controlled
by an inhibitor chip.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.904
He's telling the truth.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.157
The Kaminoans put chips in all the clones.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.368
Remember what I told you in the brig?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.704
You can't help it.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.708
Aim for the kid.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.670
-Your issue's with me, not her.
- Hurry up.

12:33.753 --> 12:38.717
Systems online in three, two, one.
-I suggest you drop your weapon.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.555
Go!

12:56.568 --> 12:57.861
Look out!

13:17.589 --> 13:18.715
Whoa!

13:19.466 --> 13:21.634
-[Wrecker grunts]
-[ES-04 groans]

13:21.718 --> 13:24.346
Direct hit. Yeah!

13:43.531 --> 13:45.533
The ion engine chamber?

13:46.534 --> 13:47.994
Why'd you bring us here?

13:48.078 --> 13:50.955
Because this is
our alternate egress off the cruiser.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.125
I don't even know what that means.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.669
Whoa. Uh-oh.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.608
-Status report?

14:18.692 --> 14:21.236
There's no sign of them.
They're avoiding the choke points.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.988
Bring a shuttle to the artillery deck.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.326
They must be heading aft.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.371
Get to the bridge and wait for my orders.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.308
We're almost there.
A little further.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.483
I didn't think you meant
we'd be escaping through the engine.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.901
I could not have been clearer.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.361
Whoa!

15:08.825 --> 15:12.579
Whoa, I've never been inside
an ion engine before.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.623
It'd be weirder if you had.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.460
These chambers are
quite the engineering marvel.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.296
This blast primer coating
is capable of withstand--

15:21.379 --> 15:23.715
No one cares! Keep movin'.
-

15:35.685 --> 15:37.312
Well? Now what?

15:39.981 --> 15:41.691
Whoa! Whoa.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.905
Try again, Hunter.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.783
I told you before, you're surrounded.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.204
Double back.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.545
What is that?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.756
Sounds like the engine's
coming online.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.008
But that's not possible, right?

16:07.092 --> 16:08.593
Technically, it is.
-

16:08.677 --> 16:12.013
I restored the ship's main power core
when I accessed the central system,

16:12.097 --> 16:14.307
which means the engines can be activated.

16:17.394 --> 16:20.647
Crosshair wouldn't do that, would he?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.775
How much time do we have?

16:23.858 --> 16:26.194
I estimate less than two minutes.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.041
What do we do?

16:40.125 --> 16:42.210
Uh, what about Plan 7?

16:43.378 --> 16:47.382
Plan 7 has nothing to do
with this situation whatsoever.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.843
Well-- Well you think of something!

16:49.926 --> 16:53.221
Can we use the explosives from the armory
to disable the engine?

16:53.304 --> 16:56.683
It won't cause a large enough
reaction to affect the thermal chamber.

16:56.766 --> 17:00.061
But if we place a series of charges
around this cone,

17:00.145 --> 17:02.230
we may be able to break away
from the cylinder

17:02.313 --> 17:03.857
while destabilizing the core.

17:04.524 --> 17:08.528
Break away? You mean fall?
All the way down?

17:08.611 --> 17:11.031
It's that or be incinerated.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.532
Everyone take an explosive.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.617
Tech, Omega, up top with me.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.850
Sir, the engines are ready.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.602
Engage.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.276
Everybody, get down!

17:48.360 --> 17:50.528
-

17:55.867 --> 17:56.951
Whoa!

17:59.496 --> 18:00.622
Hold on!

18:04.209 --> 18:05.168
No!

18:17.138 --> 18:18.264
I've got you.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.561
-

18:32.195 --> 18:34.072
Turn the engines off.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.210
Hunter, we landed on the port side.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.753
What's your status?

18:48.837 --> 18:51.214
We're by the engine,
and we've got company.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.175
Meet back at the Marauder.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.693
Commander. Commander, can you hear me?

19:11.776 --> 19:13.403
-We need a medic!
-

19:17.282 --> 19:20.160
-CT-8508, have you secured the enemy ship?

19:21.536 --> 19:24.164
CT-8508, do you copy?

19:24.247 --> 19:27.167
CT-8508. Report!

19:34.716 --> 19:35.884
What happened to them?

19:40.138 --> 19:43.767
Someone's here.
This wasn't the scrappers' handiwork.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.102
Wasn't much work.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.903
Omega. Get behind me.

20:06.122 --> 20:09.751
I've taken down
so many clones over the years.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.171
Once you figure out one,
the rest are easy.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.091
You're in for a surprise.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.635
I doubt that.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.429
He's a bounty hunter.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.390
Ain't you smart?

20:24.057 --> 20:26.518
The kid's got it all figured out.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.728
You're in trouble now.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.563
Who hired you?

20:31.523 --> 20:34.609
Son, that's confidential information.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.696
Now hand her over.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.740
She's with us.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.909
She's not going anywhere.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.412
That's unfortunate…

20:46.788 --> 20:47.789
for you.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.198
My booster!

21:22.282 --> 21:23.616
Hunter!

21:28.288 --> 21:29.330
Hunter?

21:35.545 --> 21:37.630
Sorry, little lady.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.865
-

22:03.948 --> 22:05.742
Ground forces have them on the run.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.414
Get me on the shuttle.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.377
Hunter. Wake up.
-

22:19.714 --> 22:22.008
What happened? Where's Omega?

22:22.092 --> 22:24.052
He was shot in the chest plate.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.012
We have to get him on board.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.264
Incoming!

22:28.348 --> 22:30.392
Got him. Tech, fly us out of here!

22:30.475 --> 22:31.976
Go, go, go!

22:48.159 --> 22:50.704
He… He took Omega.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.414
Who? Crosshair?

22:52.497 --> 22:55.208
No. A bounty hunter.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.378
We have to find her.
