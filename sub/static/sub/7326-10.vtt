I PROBABLY CAN'T WRITE
ABOUT THIS IN THE ARTICLE,

BUT SOMETHING ABOUT
HOW MY TOOTHPASTE

01:02.062 --> 01:04.365
HIT THE SINK
MADE ME REALIZE

THAT THE ARRAY COULD BE

JUST CALL ME AND--

NO, I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.
I JUST NEED TO READ EVERYTHING

01:26.357 --> 01:28.819

WELL, I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
TOO MUCH QUIET

01:33.764 --> 01:35.596
BECAUSE YOU DID SAY
THAT I COULD COME VISIT.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.097
I DID SAY THAT.
YEAH.

SHE BROUGHT MUFFINS.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.112
IT'S HER DAY OFF.
SHE'S DOING HOMEWORK.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.315

YEAH. GOD.

TWO MINUTES IN.

I KNOW, BUT HE'S BEEN
PRACTICING.

02:16.707 --> 02:18.309
AS SOON AS I GET A MINUTE
I'LL GO CHECK ON HIM AGAIN.

02:18.309 --> 02:19.640
HI.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.872
YOU'RE ON MY SERVICE AGAIN?
I'M SORRY.

AS SOON AS I CHANGE,
I WANNA GO THROUGH

02:23.244 --> 02:24.275

02:24.275 --> 02:25.316
BEFORE WE START
PRINTING THE VEIN.

02:25.316 --> 02:26.547
I'M SORRY.
BEFORE YOU DO THAT,

02:26.547 --> 02:28.179
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
CHECK ON YOUR PANCREAS LADY,

02:28.179 --> 02:29.820
DONNA KAUFMAN.
NOT GOOD.

02:29.820 --> 02:32.183

WE COULD REMOVE THE TUMOR,

02:32.183 --> 02:34.855
BUT IT'S ADVANCED FURTHER
THAN WE INITIALLY THOUGHT.
(sighs)

02:34.855 --> 02:37.328
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION
WOULD BE TO RELIEVE

02:37.328 --> 02:39.790
YOUR OBSTRUCTION AND BLOCK
THE NERVES IN THE AREA.

02:39.790 --> 02:43.163

WITH THE PAIN.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.196

GONNA TRY?

THERE WAS MORE

02:49.200 --> 02:51.772
THAT WE COULD DO.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.476
DEALING WITH THE PAIN
IS A LOT BETTER THAN NOTHING.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.547
LET'S DO THAT.

02:56.547 --> 02:57.808
OKAY.
OKAY.

02:57.808 --> 02:59.710
SOONER IS BETTER.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.817
(woman speaking indistinctly

03:06.817 --> 03:08.719
WE'VE BEEN TREATING HIM WITH
DIURETICS AND BETA BLOCKERS,

03:08.719 --> 03:09.890
BUT HE'S STILL GOT
A LOT OF EDEMA.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.192
HE'LL RALLY ONCE
WE PUT IN THE GRAFT.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.664

OUT OF HERE.

YEAH, UH, WE FINISHED
THEM LAST NIGHT.

SHANE'S PRINTING OUT

HE'S... GETTING LAID.

YOU KNOW, EVERYONE SHOULD
BE GETTING LAID.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.787
I SHOULD BE GETTING LAID.
OH, HERE WE GO AGAIN.

03:36.787 --> 03:39.720
MY WORK SUFFERS WHEN I'M NOT.
IT'S BAD FOR HUMANITY.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.821
ALL RIGHT,
CAN YOU MAKE UP WITH MER

03:40.821 --> 03:42.293
SO I DON'T HAVE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SEX?

03:42.293 --> 03:43.654
WHY ARE YOU
BEING SUCH A PRISS?

03:43.654 --> 03:45.626
DON'T YOU TALK TO
YOUR GUY FRIENDS ABOUT SEX?

03:45.626 --> 03:46.857
WHO? AVERY? (scoffs) NO.

03:46.857 --> 03:48.399
WELL, YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT
WHO'S GOT THE BEST

03:48.399 --> 03:49.630
RACK IN THE SHACK?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.802
MAYBE.
SO YOU CAN DO IT WITH ME.

03:51.802 --> 03:54.405
OKAY, FINE. YOUR WORK'S
SUFFERING SO BAD,

03:54.405 --> 03:56.337
THEN, UM, FIND SOMETHING
TO PLAY WITH.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.938
GET YOUR YAYAS OUT
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.611
WHAT LIKE...
BATTERY-OPERATED?

04:00.611 --> 04:02.242
NO, HUMAN.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.975
A HUMAN SEX TOY?
YOU ASKED.

04:04.975 --> 04:06.517
(clears throat)

04:08.649 --> 04:10.281
HOW LONG YOU BEEN THERE?

04:10.281 --> 04:12.383
SOMEWHERE AROUND "YAYAS."
THAT'S GREAT.

04:12.383 --> 04:13.854
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.956
OUR CONDUIT'S CONTAMINATED.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.558
HOW THE HELL
DID THAT HAPPEN?

04:17.558 --> 04:18.689
I DON'T KNOW.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.791
I CAN PRINT ANOTHER ONE
AND TRY VACUUM SEEDING,

04:20.791 --> 04:21.992
BUT IT'LL TAKE LONGER.

04:21.992 --> 04:23.794
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO DO THE PROCEDURE TODAY.

04:23.794 --> 04:25.966
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS KID
CAN HANG ON FOR ONE MORE DAY.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.499
WE GOTTA TRY, RIGHT?
IT'S STILL HIS BEST SHOT.

04:28.499 --> 04:30.541
I'LL TALK TO KAREV.

04:30.541 --> 04:32.973
DR. GREY'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE
THE PRINTER BY 10:00 A.M. TODAY.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.645
WE MADE THE SCHEDULE
AND MADE A BIG STINK

04:34.645 --> 04:37.448
ABOUT HOW
SHE HAD TO STICK TO IT.

04:37.448 --> 04:39.710
EDWARDS! HEY!
UH, CAN YOU WRITE DOWN

04:39.710 --> 04:41.852
YOUR MAILING ADDRESS
FOR ME?
SURE.

04:41.852 --> 04:43.914
I'M SENDING YOU AN INVITATION
TO MY WEDDING.

04:43.914 --> 04:44.915
(elevator bell dings)

04:44.915 --> 04:46.687
THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THEM
ONLINE.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.359
IT'S BETTER
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, I KNOW.

04:48.359 --> 04:50.461
BUT I JUST COULDN'T DEAL
WITH AN EVITE TO MY WEDDING.

04:50.461 --> 04:53.624
(chuckles) GREAT!
I REALLY HOPE YOU'LL COME.

04:53.624 --> 04:56.927
AND, UM, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU CAN ALSO, LIKE,

04:56.927 --> 04:58.429
BRING A GUEST.

04:58.429 --> 05:01.001
(telephone rings in distance)

05:01.001 --> 05:02.903
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:02.903 --> 05:04.435
(door closes)

05:04.435 --> 05:06.807
HIS B.P.'s IN THE TOILET.
IF THIS PROCEDURE'S NOT READY,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.879
YOU GOTTA COME UP
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

05:08.879 --> 05:11.041
IT'S ONE DAY.
CAN YOU RELAX?

05:11.041 --> 05:12.513
GOD, MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO NEEDS A LITTLE

05:12.513 --> 05:14.915
RECREATIONAL ENERGY
RELEASE.
I'M GETTING LAID.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.016
REGULARLY.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.588
SO ALL MY ANXIETY
IS BASED ON THE FACT

05:17.588 --> 05:18.849
THAT YOU BROUGHT ME
ON THIS CASE

05:18.849 --> 05:21.021
AND ASKED ME TO KEEP A KID ALIVE
LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU

05:21.021 --> 05:22.853
TO DO A FANCY PROCEDURE
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

05:22.853 --> 05:25.996
(siren wailing in distance)

05:25.996 --> 05:27.598
(Ben) ALL RIGHT,
MAYBE IT'S NOTHING.

05:27.598 --> 05:29.530
BUT MAYBE IT'S WORTH
HAVING A CONVERSATION

05:29.530 --> 05:30.861
WITH SOMEBODY IN PSYCH.

05:30.861 --> 05:33.003
OH, YOU'RE MAKING A MOUNTAIN
OUT OF--
LOOK, IT CAN'T HURT!

05:33.003 --> 05:35.566
LOOK, HELL, I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A SIT-DOWN WITH SOMEBODY

05:35.566 --> 05:37.968
AND TALK A COUPLE THINGS OUT
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

05:37.968 --> 05:39.870
WELL, THEN YOU GO.
I HAVE A BUSY SCHEDULE.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.042
NAVEL GAZING IS NOT ON IT.
THAT'S MY POINT.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.944
OVERLOADING YOUR SCHEDULE
CAN EXACERBATE

05:43.944 --> 05:45.416
THE KIND OF BEHAVIORS
YOU'VE BEEN--

05:45.416 --> 05:47.718
I'M NOT HAVING BEHAVIORS!
I'M HAVING A LIFE.

05:47.718 --> 05:49.450
LIKE YOU USED TO HAVE

05:49.450 --> 05:50.851
WHEN YOU WERE PURSUING
SOMETHING THAT CHALLENGED YOU.
(woman groaning)

05:50.851 --> 05:51.882
BAILEY, YOU HAVE TIME
FOR AN EX-LAP?

05:51.882 --> 05:52.983

WITH A SURGICAL ABDOMEN.

05:52.983 --> 05:54.955
ABSOLUTELY.
(Jackson) TRAUMA TWO!

05:57.458 --> 05:59.730
(woman speaking indistinctly

05:59.730 --> 06:01.892
WHAT DO WE GOT?
ELLA HOLMES, 6,
HIT BY A CAR,

06:01.892 --> 06:03.363
TACHYCARDIC AND HYPOTENSIVE.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.596
SHE WAS ON HER SCOOTER.
SHE KNOWS SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED

06:05.596 --> 06:06.837
TO RIDE IT DOWN THE HILL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

06:06.837 --> 06:07.968
SHOW ME THE ULTRASOUND.
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.871
ARE YOU HER MOM?
THEY'RE OUT OF TOWN.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.372
INTRAPERITONEAL
FREE FLUID.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.004
CALL C.T. AND BOOK AN O.R.
JUST IN CASE.
DR. ROBBINS?

06:14.004 --> 06:16.877
SHE'S GOT A SUPRACONDYLAR
FEMUR FRACTURE.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.449
OKAY, CALL TORRES.

06:18.449 --> 06:19.710
(lowered voice)
IS THAT GONNA BE OKAY?

06:19.710 --> 06:20.851
(lowered voice)
YEAH, WE'RE ON THE MEND.

06:20.851 --> 06:21.982
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.014
(normal voice) MURPHY,
GO WITH TORRES AND ROBBINS.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.517
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
IT'LL BE FINE.

06:26.517 --> 06:27.958
I DON'T THINK--
MURPHY!

06:27.958 --> 06:29.890
(monitor beeping rapidly)
PRESSURE'S DROPPING!

06:29.890 --> 06:31.692
(girl) WHAT IS THAT?
I CAN'T WAIT FOR A C.T.
PREP HER FOR THE O.R.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.023
I HAVE TO CALL HER PARENTS.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM?

06:33.023 --> 06:34.595
I'LL UPDATE YOU
AS SOON AS WE KNOW.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.926
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE.
LET'S GO.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.870
BUT IS--IS EVERYTHING
GOING TO BE OKAY?

06:39.870 --> 06:40.901
IT'S ALL GOING
TO BE FINE.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.986
(water pouring)
CAN YOU PULL THAT LAP PAD OUT
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY BLEEDING?

06:55.986 --> 06:58.819
SLOWLY.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.521
GOOD.
(lap pad thuds)

07:00.521 --> 07:03.494
DR. TORRES IS GONNA
FIX THE FEMUR?

07:03.494 --> 07:05.496
YEAH, BUT SHE'LL NEED SOME HELP
SO YOU SHOULD STICK AROUND.

07:05.496 --> 07:06.727
WELL, YOU'LL HELP HER,
RIGHT?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.058
I MEAN, YOU DON'T THINK
SHE NEEDS TWO PEOPLE.

07:08.058 --> 07:09.700
YOU'RE A RESIDENT.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.001
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BEG
TO BE IN THAT ROOM.

07:11.001 --> 07:13.534
(sighs) I'M SORRY
IF IT'S AWKWARD.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.506
I HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE.

07:15.506 --> 07:17.808
YOU TWO ARE DEFINITELY
GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

07:17.808 --> 07:19.470
WE ARE.

07:19.470 --> 07:22.042
LIKE YOU'RE TRYING IT OUT
OR LIKE...
LEAH.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.714
YOU DON'T WANNA BE
THE PERSON WHO SAYS,

07:23.714 --> 07:25.115
"I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
IN CASE IT DOESN'T WORK OUT

07:25.115 --> 07:27.718
WITH YOUR WIFE."

07:29.720 --> 07:30.951
(suction gurgling)

07:30.951 --> 07:33.954
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND
A WOMAN FOR HIM

07:33.954 --> 07:36.557
TO BE WITH ONCE YOU'VE PASSED.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.888
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STRANGE.

07:37.888 --> 07:39.990
BUT I DON'T WANT HIM
TO BE ALONE.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.993
AND IF HE'S ON HIS OWN,
I DON'T THINK HE'LL DO IT.

07:42.993 --> 07:46.737
IT'S CERTAINLY UNUSUAL.
BUT I UNDERSTAND.

07:46.737 --> 07:48.739
YOU LOVE YOUR HUSBAND.

07:48.739 --> 07:51.702
IT'S--IT'S NOT MY HUSBAND.

07:51.702 --> 07:54.845
I MEAN, I LOVE MY HUSBAND.

07:54.845 --> 07:57.578
BUT THIS IS FOR
SOMEONE ELSE--STAN.

07:57.578 --> 08:01.051
HE'S A VERY SPECIAL FRIEND.

08:01.051 --> 08:05.155
DONNA, I'M GONNA NEED
TO GET AT THAT LEFT ARM.

08:05.155 --> 08:06.256
(mouths words)

08:06.256 --> 08:07.918
YEAH, IT'S A LOT
MORE VERSATILE.

08:07.918 --> 08:09.890
WELL, IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT,
NO QUESTION.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.792
MAYBE IF YOU HAVE TIME
OVER LUNCH,

08:11.792 --> 08:13.223
YOU CAN LOOK OVER
THE PROPOSAL.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.726
I WISH I COULD. I'VE GOT
BACK-TO-BACK SURGERIES.

08:15.726 --> 08:17.868
HOW'S IT FEEL TO BE BACK
IN THE ANESTHESIA GAME?

08:17.868 --> 08:19.169
IT'S FINE.

08:19.169 --> 08:21.501
NOT IDEAL, BUT, YOU KNOW,
GOT A FAMILY.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.703
YOU MAKE COMPROMISES.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.676
YEAH, MEREDITH
IS GONNA KILL ME.

08:25.676 --> 08:26.937
WHAT? SHE DOESN'T LIKE
AN SYMMETRICAL ARRAY?

08:26.937 --> 08:28.008
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE DOWNSHIFTING,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.209
AND SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE UPSHIFTING.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.882
AH, AND YET YOU FIND
INSPIRATION IN TOOTHPASTE.

08:31.882 --> 08:34.284
(chuckles) MAYBE NEXT TIME,
YOU KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

08:34.284 --> 08:35.646
THAT WORKS FOR YOU?

08:35.646 --> 08:37.948
IN A MARRIAGE? YES.
YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

08:37.948 --> 08:41.652
ALTHOUGH, UH, KINDA...
MIRANDA'S BEEN, UH,

08:41.652 --> 08:43.894
KIND OF STRUGGLING LATELY.

08:43.894 --> 08:46.526
SHE HAS WHAT, UH,
IF YOU SQUINT REAL HARD

08:46.526 --> 08:49.199
LOOKS A LOT LIKE O.C.D.

08:49.199 --> 08:50.731
BAILEY?

08:50.731 --> 08:53.203
YEAH, SHE HAD THAT INCIDENT
WITH THE HOLE IN THE GLOVES.
MM.

08:53.203 --> 08:54.835
I KNEW IT FREAKED HER OUT,
BUT I WAS AWAY.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.767
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH
IT FREAKED HER OUT.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.138
YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S O.C.D.?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.710
I DON'T KNOW.

08:59.710 --> 09:00.811
I WANTED TO LET HER
DEAL WITH IT HER WAY,

09:00.811 --> 09:02.573
BUT I'M NOT SURE
SHE'S DEALING WITH IT.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.314
WE WERE IN THE O.R.
THE OTHER DAY,

09:04.314 --> 09:06.647
AND SHE KEPT THE PATIENT UNDER
EASILY AN EXTRA HOUR.
BEN--

09:06.647 --> 09:07.948
SHE WENT PAST THAT.
I-I-I'M NOT SURE--

09:07.948 --> 09:09.319
NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.
I SHOULD STAY OUT OF IT.

09:09.319 --> 09:10.851
BUT WHEN I'M WATCHING
A SURGEON PERFORM

09:10.851 --> 09:12.322
WHAT LOOKS LIKE
UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES--

09:12.322 --> 09:13.984
I AM ON THE BOARD
OF THIS HOSPITAL.

09:13.984 --> 09:16.587
I CAN'T HEAR ABOUT
A PHYSICIAN'S MISCONDUCT

09:16.587 --> 09:17.658
AND NOT REPORT IT.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.133
I THINK YOU TELLING DR. GREY
IS GONNA GO OVER BETTER THAN--

09:23.133 --> 09:25.195
NO, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO MANAGE
HER FEELINGS RIGHT NOW.

09:25.195 --> 09:26.837
JUST APOLOGIZE,
WE FEEL TERRIBLE,

09:26.837 --> 09:28.238
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

09:28.238 --> 09:31.141
SHE'LL BE PISSY,
BUT SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

09:31.141 --> 09:32.673
WELL, I COULD HAVE EDWARDS
TELL HER.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.974
SHE'S ON HER SERVICE.
EVEN BETTER.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.977
(indistinct conversations)

09:40.180 --> 09:44.154
IF YOU EVER NEED ANY...
YAYA EXTRACTION...

09:46.186 --> 09:48.158
GETTING THE YAYAS OUT...

09:50.661 --> 09:53.293
I'M AVAILABLE.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.129
ARE YOU OFFERING
TO SERVICE ME?

09:59.129 --> 10:01.031
SORRY.
IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

10:01.031 --> 10:03.704
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORK.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.136
THAT'S EVEN WORSE.

10:06.136 --> 10:07.277
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CLAIM

10:07.277 --> 10:08.378
THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME
OR SOMETHING.

10:08.378 --> 10:09.840
WELL, I CERTAINLY FIND YOU
ATTRACTIVE.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.842
THERE'S NO QUESTION.
I MEAN,

10:11.842 --> 10:14.614
I WOULDN'T BE SO PRESUMPTUOUS
AS TO ASSUME--
STOP TALKING.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.647
IT'S...

10:16.647 --> 10:17.818
(elevator bell dings)

10:17.818 --> 10:20.120
GOOD.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.793
HEY, ARE THOSE LEFT OVER
FROM THE MORNING MEETING?

10:22.793 --> 10:24.755
UNH-UNH, SHE BAKED THEM.

10:24.755 --> 10:27.357
YOU'RE KIDDING.
I KIND OF HATE YOU.
MMM.

10:27.357 --> 10:29.860
YEAH, I KINDA HATE ME,
TOO.
MMM.

10:29.860 --> 10:33.003
HMM. IF SHE'S COOKING
YOUR THANKSGIVING DINNER,

10:33.003 --> 10:34.665
I WANT THE LEFTOVERS.

10:34.665 --> 10:36.366
OH, I'M NOT--
OH, WE'RE NOT--

10:36.366 --> 10:37.738
WELL, I MEAN...
WE COULD.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.969
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY THAT.

10:38.969 --> 10:40.811
I-I HADN'T GIVEN IT
MUCH THOUGHT SO...

10:40.811 --> 10:42.012
SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO OPEN A CAN OF WORMS.

10:42.012 --> 10:44.875
I JUST--I MEAN, YOU COULD DO
WHAT WE DO AT MY HOUSE,

10:44.875 --> 10:46.717
WHICH IS ACT LIKE
IT'S NOT EVEN HAPPENING.

10:46.717 --> 10:50.650
(chuckles) SO YOU'RE--YOU'RE NOT
GOING HOME TO YOUR FAMILY, OR...

10:50.650 --> 10:52.182
I'M ON CALL THE NEXT DAY.

10:52.182 --> 10:53.383
OH. WELL,
WE COULD DO SOMETHING.

10:53.383 --> 10:55.285
OH, THEY'RE PAINTING
MY APARTMENT NEXT WEEK.

10:55.285 --> 10:57.227
AND WE CAN'T REALLY COOK
IN THE TRAILER.

10:57.227 --> 11:00.090
WHY NOT? WE COULD JUST
EAT OUTDOORS, AND...

11:00.090 --> 11:01.191
IN NOVEMBER?
YEAH.

11:01.191 --> 11:02.693
YOU COULD COOK AT MY HOUSE.

11:02.693 --> 11:04.795
YOU'D HAVE TO FEED US,
TOO, BUT...

11:04.795 --> 11:06.036
THAT COULD BE FUN.

11:06.036 --> 11:07.738
I DON'T WANNA COMMANDEER
YOUR KITCHEN.

11:07.738 --> 11:09.770
OH, PLEASE.
SOMEONE SHOULD. (chuckles)

11:09.770 --> 11:11.872
THEY MADE THOSE
CONSTRUCTION PAPER TURKEYS

11:11.872 --> 11:13.874
AT ZOLA'S SCHOOL,
AND SHE HAD NO IDEA

11:13.874 --> 11:15.405
WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT.

11:15.405 --> 11:17.808
YOU'D MAKE ME LOOK LIKE
A BETTER MOTHER.

11:17.808 --> 11:18.779
THINK ABOUT IT.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.680
PANCREATIC TUMOR.
GOTTA GO.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.912
MM-HMM.
(chuckles)

11:21.912 --> 11:23.253
THANKS.
WELCOME.

11:23.253 --> 11:25.716
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

11:25.716 --> 11:26.957
DO YOU HAVE
DONNA'S PRE-OP LABS?

11:26.957 --> 11:28.018
IN PROCESS.

11:28.018 --> 11:30.220
I'M GONNA GO EXAMINE
DR. WEBBER.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.421
AND WHEN I GET BACK,

11:31.421 --> 11:32.793
WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED
ON THE PRINTER.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.725
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

11:34.725 --> 11:35.796
YEAH.

11:35.796 --> 11:39.299
PFFT, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.001
I GOT HER KICKED OFF
HER OWN SURGERY

11:41.001 --> 11:42.172
A FEW DAYS AGO.

11:42.172 --> 11:43.904
ALEX TOLD ME. BALLSY.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.235
STUPID.

11:45.235 --> 11:48.408
DID KEPNER INVITE YOU
TO HER WEDDING?
NO.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.080
SO SHE DIDN'T ASK YOU
FOR YOUR ADDRESS?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.812
NO, BUT I'M SURE ALEX
IS INVITED.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.913
I'M PROBABLY
THE PLUS ONE.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.015
HEY, DR. YANG NEEDS
THE PRINTER AGAIN TODAY.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.287
UH, NO.
ONE DAY.
TELL GREY WE'RE SORRY.

11:57.287 --> 11:58.889
NO, YOU--YOU TELL HER.
CAN'T.

11:58.889 --> 11:59.890
GOTTA GET THE PRINTER GOING
SO WE ONLY TAKE ONE DAY

11:59.890 --> 12:01.451
AWAY FROM YOU, NOT TWO.
SHANE--

12:01.451 --> 12:03.794
DYING BABY WAITING
ON A PART.
NO--

12:03.794 --> 12:05.796
GET BACK HERE!
(Webber) I'M A WASTE OF A BED.

12:05.796 --> 12:07.998
YOUR STRESS TEST
WAS A DISASTER.

12:07.998 --> 12:10.861
YOU WANT ME TO DWELL
ON ALL YOUR PAST FAILURES?

12:10.861 --> 12:12.903
I'M A DIFFERENT MAN
THAN I WAS LAST WEEK.

12:12.903 --> 12:14.905
I EXERCISE.

12:14.905 --> 12:16.006
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
DON'T THINK ABOUT

12:16.006 --> 12:17.437
GOING INTO
A REHAB FACILITY.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.369
WE CAN GET YOU IN THERE
EVEN IF YOU DON'T PASS.

12:19.369 --> 12:22.342
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO A FACILITY.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.844
IT'S BAD ENOUGH I'M HERE...

12:23.844 --> 12:26.917
WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS ME...
AND HAS TO BE NICE.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.478
WELL, YOU CAN'T GO HOME
ALONE.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.180
I'LL GET
A HOME HEALTH AIDE.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.452
I'LL HAVE WILSON
RUN ANOTHER STRESS TEST.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.455
YOU WATCH. FLYING COLORS.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.057
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET
OUT OF HERE IN TIME,

12:37.057 --> 12:38.889
YOU CAN HAVE THANKSGIVING DINNER
AT OUR HOUSE

12:38.889 --> 12:40.490
IF YOU AND CATHERINE
DON'T HAVE PLANS.

12:40.490 --> 12:41.461
YOU COOKIN'?

12:41.461 --> 12:42.863
IS THAT SO PREPOSTEROUS?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.194
YOU WANT A STRAIGHT ANSWER?

12:44.194 --> 12:46.096
NO, OWEN'S GIRLFRIEND
IS COOKING.

12:46.096 --> 12:47.167
(telephone ringing)

12:47.167 --> 12:48.799
DOES SHE PUT MUSHROOMS
IN HER STUFFING?

12:48.799 --> 12:51.001
I FIND IT MAKES IT SOGGY.

12:52.502 --> 12:53.904
HEY.

12:53.904 --> 12:56.346
HEY. YOU DONE ALREADY?

12:56.346 --> 12:58.508
NO, SHE WAS TOO EDEMATOUS.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.450
WE PACKED HER AND PUT IN
A TEMPORARY CLOSURE.

13:00.450 --> 13:01.982
YOU CAN DO HER FEMUR
TOMORROW AFTER WE CLOSE.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.513
OKAY.

13:04.955 --> 13:07.057
I WANNA TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

13:07.057 --> 13:08.258
HMM?

13:08.258 --> 13:12.923
I WAS WITH SOMEONE
WHEN WE WERE APART.

13:12.923 --> 13:15.926
I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS
COMPLETELY OUT-OF-BOUNDS.

13:15.926 --> 13:17.797
WE WERE SEPARATED, AND YOU'D
KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.870
OH, SO IT'S MY FAULT?

13:19.870 --> 13:23.533
THERE ARE NO FAULTS. I JUST...
FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD KNOW.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.535
WE'RE STARTING FRESH,
AND...

13:25.535 --> 13:28.338
I WANNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I...

13:28.338 --> 13:30.040
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ANYTHING.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.341
NO, NO. (sighs)

13:31.341 --> 13:33.283
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:33.283 --> 13:35.545
THANK YOU FOR...

13:35.545 --> 13:37.918
BEING SO VERY HONEST.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.420
I'M TRYING.

13:42.152 --> 13:44.855
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU WANNA ASK ME?

13:44.855 --> 13:45.956
OH, WOW.

13:45.956 --> 13:50.530
UM... NO.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.462
I DON'T KNOW. WAS IT..
(sighs)

13:52.462 --> 13:54.034
WAS IT ONCE?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.136
IT WAS MORE THAN ONCE.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.969
MORE THAN TWICE?

14:01.211 --> 14:03.573
MORE THAN TEN?
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T...

14:03.573 --> 14:05.976
I DON'T WANNA KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

14:05.976 --> 14:07.247
I'M SORRY.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.578
IS IT OVER?

14:08.578 --> 14:12.022
YES. COMPLETELY.

14:12.022 --> 14:14.854
OKAY.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.556
THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.029
YOU DIDN'T?
WHAT?

14:19.029 --> 14:21.331
CHEAT ON YOU?

14:21.331 --> 14:23.593
GET INVOLVED WITH ANYONE.
(scoffs)

14:23.593 --> 14:25.865
I GOT INVOLVED
WITH MYSELF.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.469
I... (scoffs)
DANCED IN MY UNDERWEAR,

14:29.469 --> 14:30.570
AND I TRIED TO REMEMBER

14:30.570 --> 14:32.872
THAT I USED TO BE A PERSON
WHO HAD FUN.

14:32.872 --> 14:38.378
I'M REALLY TRYING.
CALLIE, PLEASE...

14:38.378 --> 14:40.450
TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE TRYING, TOO.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.652
I AM.

14:42.652 --> 14:44.484
CAN I HUG YOU?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.917
YEAH.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.292
(sighs)

14:52.292 --> 14:53.593
I REALLY MISSED YOU.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.624
(whispers) ME, TOO.

14:56.666 --> 14:58.668
SORRY.

14:58.668 --> 15:01.031
UH... ELLA'S THIGH
IS REALLY SWOLLEN.

15:01.031 --> 15:02.172
SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE.

15:02.172 --> 15:03.633
ALL RIGHT, WE GOTTA GET HER
BACK IN THE O.R.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.435
AND, UH, DO THE FEMUR RIGHT NOW.

15:05.435 --> 15:07.938
UM... ARE... YOU GONNA HELP ME?

15:07.938 --> 15:11.141
SURE. WILL YOU GIVE
THE FAMILY AN UPDATE?

15:11.141 --> 15:13.944
THEY'RE ON A...

15:13.944 --> 15:14.945
PLANE.

15:14.945 --> 15:16.947
IT'S JUST THE BABYSITTER.

15:16.947 --> 15:17.948
DR. GREY.

15:17.948 --> 15:19.319
I HAVE TO STOP
IN POST-OPS.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.251
TELL WILSON TO RUN
A STRESS TEST ON DR. WEBBER--

15:21.251 --> 15:23.223
THEY NEED THE PRINTER TODAY--
DR. YANG.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.254
WHAT? NO. SORRY.

15:24.254 --> 15:25.925
THEY SAID IT'S NOT UP
FOR DISCUSSION.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.327
THEY'RE ALREADY
RUNNING IT.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.999
I MEAN, I TRIED TO TALK
TO ROSS,

15:28.999 --> 15:31.531
BUT HE SAID DR. YANG ISN'T
EVEN INTERESTED IN HAVING--

15:33.603 --> 15:35.135
(sighs)

15:42.642 --> 15:44.014
(woman) NURSES' STATION.
WE NEED TO TALK.

15:44.014 --> 15:45.515
WE REALLY DON'T.
NO, WE DO.

15:45.515 --> 15:47.247
I HAVE TO WRAP UP A PATIENT
IN THE E.R. BACK HERE IN 15?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.278
OKAY.
YES. GREAT.

15:48.278 --> 15:49.419
DR. HUNT?
MM-HMM?

15:49.419 --> 15:51.721
HEY, SO I INVITED DR. WEBBER
TO THANKSGIVING,

15:51.721 --> 15:53.183
SO NOW IT REALLY HAS
TO HAPPEN.

15:53.183 --> 15:55.555
HIS LADY IS COOKING THANKSGIVING
DINNER AT OUR HOUSE.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.557
(Derek) OH, THAT'S NICE.
SHOULD WE INVITE
MORE PEOPLE?

15:57.557 --> 16:00.090
WELL, UH, IF WE'RE MAKING
A WHOLE TURKEY,

16:00.090 --> 16:01.391
WE CAN--WE CAN INVITE
A FEW MORE.

16:01.391 --> 16:03.333
OKAY, LET'S GET DR. YANG HERE,
PLEASE.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.235
YOU AND BAILEY CAN COME.
WE'RE GOING TO MY FAMILY,

16:05.235 --> 16:07.237
ASSUMING SHE'S STILL SPEAKING
TO ME BY THEN.

16:07.237 --> 16:09.099
HMM.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
INVITE CALLIE.

16:09.099 --> 16:11.041
I'M SURE WITH THE TRIAL,
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME

16:11.041 --> 16:13.403
TO MAKE PLANS.
SO WE'RE NOT INVITING ARIZONA.
WE CAN'T HAVE BOTH.

16:13.403 --> 16:14.504
WELL, THEY'RE BACK TOGETHER,
SO...

16:14.504 --> 16:16.646
THEY ARE?
HEY, CAN YOU GO DO
YOUR THING

16:16.646 --> 16:18.308
SO WE CAN GET TO OUR THING?
YES.

16:18.308 --> 16:19.649
SO WE'RE NOT INVITING YANG,
RIGHT?

16:19.649 --> 16:21.281
BECAUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE...
UH, SHE PROBABLY HAS PLANS.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.113
NO, SHE PROBABLY DOESN'T.
(Derek) OH.

16:23.113 --> 16:25.285
(telephone rings)
DO YOU HAVE
THANKSGIVING PLANS?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.017
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
MY HOUSE. 3:00.

16:27.017 --> 16:29.189
ALL RIGHT, I'M BRINGING JO.
I FIGURED.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.420
DON'T SOUND SO EXCITED.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.163
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE AN INTERN
BALLING AN ATTENDING ONCE.

16:33.163 --> 16:35.365
MM-HMM.
YOU KISS MY KIDS
WITH THAT MOUTH?

16:35.365 --> 16:36.696
I GOT A PRE-OP.
IT'LL BE FAST,

16:36.696 --> 16:38.468
BUT DO NOT START WITH HUNT
UNTIL I GET BACK.

16:38.468 --> 16:40.430
I WON'T.
(woman) THANK YOU.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.302
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.434
I CALLED DR. YANG.
SHE'S NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.

16:44.434 --> 16:47.437
DOES SHE KNOW IT'S ME
WHO'S ASKING FOR HER?
YES.

16:49.779 --> 16:52.382
YOU OKAY?

16:52.382 --> 16:56.486
SURE. I'M GOING TO UPDATE
A PATIENT'S BABYSITTER

16:56.486 --> 16:58.148
INSTEAD OF DOING SURGERY.

16:58.148 --> 17:00.390
BECAUSE TORRES AND ROBBINS
DON'T NEED ME.

17:00.390 --> 17:02.692
THEY HAVE EACH OTHER.
ARE THE TWO OF YOU...

17:02.692 --> 17:05.495
THEY'RE GETTING BACK
TOGETHER.

17:05.495 --> 17:07.527
WERE YOU REALLY INTO HER
OR WAS IT--

17:07.527 --> 17:09.729
I WAS REALLY INTO HER.
WHY DO I DO THIS?

17:09.729 --> 17:14.334
I CAN'T KEEP FALLING APART
AT WORK EVERY TIME I GET DUMPED.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.405
IT'S STARTING TO BE
ALL THE TIME.

17:15.405 --> 17:19.169
SO GET OFF THE FLOOR.
GO TALK TO YOUR BABYSITTER

17:19.169 --> 17:23.643
AND GET BACK IN THE O.R.
LIKE A SURGEON WOULD DO.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.646
(indistinct conversations)

17:29.549 --> 17:31.551
HEY.
OH, MY VASCULAR GRAFT--

17:31.551 --> 17:34.524
YEAH, THE ONE YOU PRINTED?
I WAS GONNA COME AND SEE IT.

17:34.524 --> 17:38.358
IT HAD A GLITCH, SO IT'LL
BE TOMORROW, HOPEFULLY.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.529
NOT TODAY.
OKAY.

17:39.529 --> 17:42.632
HEY, YOU, UH, YOU HAVE
THANKSGIVING PLANS?

17:42.632 --> 17:45.465
WELL, I'LL PROBABLY PICK UP
AN EXTRA SHIFT. YOU KNOW?

17:45.465 --> 17:48.338
I DON'T GET ALL THAT WORKED UP
ABOUT CRANBERRIES.

17:48.338 --> 17:49.369
YOU?

17:49.369 --> 17:53.303
UM... WELL, UH, IT'S,
UM...

17:53.303 --> 17:55.105
EVOLVING.

17:55.105 --> 17:58.108
YOU CAN TELL ME
YOU'RE SPENDING IT WITH EMMA.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.410
I WON'T MELT
IF I HEAR HER NAME.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.082
YES. I'LL BE WITH EMMA.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.284
SHE GONNA COOK?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.355
MM-HMM.

18:05.355 --> 18:07.287
HMM. WELL, WATCH OUT.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.459
YOU LET HER MAKE A TURKEY
FOR JUST THE TWO OF YOU,

18:09.459 --> 18:11.661
YOU'RE GONNA BE EATING LEFTOVERS
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

18:11.661 --> 18:13.563
(chuckles)

18:13.563 --> 18:15.265
(sighs)

18:15.265 --> 18:18.428
HER... FEMUR WAS BLEEDING
VERY HEAVILY INTO HER THIGH,

18:18.428 --> 18:22.602
AND... SHE WAS IN DANGER
OF LOSING TOO MUCH BLOOD.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.873
OH, MY GOD.

18:23.873 --> 18:25.205
THEY'VE TAKEN HER BACK
INTO THE O.R.,

18:25.205 --> 18:26.806
AND THEY'RE WORKING ON HER
RIGHT NOW.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.608
YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS JUST A BROKEN LEG.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.141
WELL, A FEMUR BREAK
CAN BE COMPLICATED,

18:31.141 --> 18:33.143
BUT WE'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT.

18:33.143 --> 18:35.315
OH, MY GOD.
THEY ARE GONNA KILL ME.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.416
I'M SURE
THAT THEY WON'T.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.418
I REALLY LIKED THEM, TOO.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.589
THEY WORK TOGETHER.
THEY'RE IN ALASKA,

18:39.589 --> 18:42.892
STUDYING THE NESTING HABITS
OF EAGLES.

18:42.892 --> 18:45.325
I CANNOT BELIEVE
I'M GONNA LOSE THIS JOB.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.756
THEY'RE NOT GONNA FIRE YOU.

18:46.756 --> 18:49.199
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

18:49.199 --> 18:52.432
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED.
YOU HAVE TO BLAME SOMEBODY.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.634
WHAT, ARE THEY GONNA BLAME
THEIR CHILD?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.537
THEY'RE PROBABLY NEVER
GONNA LET ME SEE HER AGAIN.

18:57.537 --> 19:03.443
I GUESS IT'S MY FAULT
FOR GETTING SO ATTACHED.

19:03.443 --> 19:07.517
HEY, CAN I BOOT YOU OUT
OF YOUR O.R. AT 4:00?

19:07.517 --> 19:09.549
UH, THE MASTOIDECTOMY
AFTER THIS?
YEAH.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.181
I NEED TO PUT A GASTRO-J
ON THE SCHEDULE,

19:11.181 --> 19:14.254
AND IF I TELL GREY SHE CAN'T GET
INTO THE O.R. UNTIL 7:00,

19:14.254 --> 19:15.625
SHE'S GONNA SHOVE
HER HAND INTO MY CHEST

19:15.625 --> 19:17.327
AND RIP OUT MY HEART
WITH HER CLAWS.

19:17.327 --> 19:18.658
THAT MEANS
I HAVE TO WORK LATE.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.390
YOU'LL BE WORKING LATE
ANYHOW,

19:20.390 --> 19:23.162
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO COMMITTED
TO THE WELFARE OF THIS HOSPITAL.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.165
AND TO THE PEOPLE
WHO COUNT ON YOU FOR SUPPORT.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.199
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I WILL TAKE IT.

19:29.199 --> 19:31.201
THANK YOU.
MM-HMM.

19:31.201 --> 19:33.403
(snaps fingers)
AND KEPNER INVITED ME
TO HER WEDDING.

19:33.403 --> 19:35.305
DID SHE?

19:35.305 --> 19:36.476
PLUS ONE.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.178
AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE INVITED... PLUS ONE.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.512
IS SHE, LIKE, EXPECTING US
TO BRING OTHER PEOPLE?

19:42.512 --> 19:46.416
NO, BRIDES ARE WEIRD.
GO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

19:46.416 --> 19:47.287
PLEASE?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.259
OKAY. (chuckles)

19:54.324 --> 19:58.798
(indistinct conversations)
(Alex typing)

19:58.798 --> 20:00.470
IS HE GONNA MAKE IT?

20:00.470 --> 20:01.671
WELL, IF YANG CAN GET
HER ACT TOGETHER.

20:01.671 --> 20:03.273
I KEEP DIURESING HIM,

20:03.273 --> 20:04.734
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK
FOR MUCH LONGER.
MM.

20:04.734 --> 20:07.237
HEY, YOU'RE INVITED
TO MER'S FOR THANKSGIVING.

20:07.237 --> 20:08.478
REALLY?

20:08.478 --> 20:10.209
I'M INVITED AND, UH,
I'M BRINGING YOU.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.881
THE ATTENDINGS ARE GONNA
BE WEIRD IF I'M THERE.

20:11.881 --> 20:12.912
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.414
JUST GO WITHOUT ME.
WE'LL MEET UP AFTER.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.545
YOU THINK I WANNA BE THERE
IF YOU'RE NOT?

20:15.545 --> 20:17.287
YOU'RE SWEET.

20:17.287 --> 20:19.389
OKAY, SCREW IT.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.251
HOW ABOUT WE GET TAKEOUT
CHICKEN AND EAT IT IN THE CAR

20:21.251 --> 20:22.352
LIKE WE WERE RAISED TO DO?

20:22.352 --> 20:23.393
I THINK I LOVE YOU.

20:23.393 --> 20:24.624
YEAH, YEAH, SETTLE DOWN.

20:26.396 --> 20:29.429
(telephone rings)

20:29.429 --> 20:31.661
TWO MORE WOMEN
RESPONDED TO THE AD.

20:31.661 --> 20:34.734
ONE OF THEM'S GONNA COME BY
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.637
DID SHE SEEM NICE?

20:37.637 --> 20:41.371
YEAH.

20:41.371 --> 20:43.813
I TOLD STAN.

20:43.813 --> 20:45.475
WHAT?

20:45.475 --> 20:47.347
WHY?

20:47.347 --> 20:49.549
I COULDN'T LET IT GO,
AND HE--

20:49.549 --> 20:51.721
OH! HE'LL HATE THIS.

20:51.721 --> 20:53.523
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO SEEM NATURAL,

20:53.523 --> 20:55.485
LIKE SOMEONE YOU'D MET
AT THE POOL.

20:55.485 --> 20:57.287
I CAN'T LIE TO HIM.

20:57.287 --> 20:59.929
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST.
THAT'S HOW IT'S WORKED.

20:59.929 --> 21:01.661
THIS ISN'T SOME BIG LIE.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.434
IT'S A KINDNESS.
YOU AGREED.

21:04.434 --> 21:06.436
WELL, THAT WAS BEFORE...

21:06.436 --> 21:08.338
BEFORE I WAS DYING?

21:08.338 --> 21:12.502
IT MATTERS MORE NOW,
NOT LESS.

21:12.502 --> 21:14.474
SO YOU'RE SAYING SHE PERFORMED
UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES?

21:14.474 --> 21:15.805
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.407
I WAS SHOOTING THE BREEZE
WITH A FRIEND,

21:17.407 --> 21:18.548
I WASN'T MAKING
A REPORT TO THE BOARD.

21:18.548 --> 21:20.350
I'M SORRY.

21:20.350 --> 21:21.751
WHATEVER. LET'S JUST
REEL IT BACK IN.

21:21.751 --> 21:24.384
YOU KNOW HE CAN'T DO THAT,
AND I CERTAINLY CAN'T.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.585
BUT SHE'S GONNA HANDLE IT.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.016
THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU SAID.

21:27.016 --> 21:29.319
YOU SAID YOU SAW THE VIRGIN MARY
IN YOUR TOOTHPASTE.

21:29.319 --> 21:30.520
WE WERE TALKING.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.821
I NEED TO PULL HER OFF
THE FLOOR,

21:31.821 --> 21:32.922
AT LEAST UNTIL THIS IS
UNDER CONTROL.

21:32.922 --> 21:34.023
SHE WAS GONNA GO...

21:34.023 --> 21:35.465
I'M SORRY.

21:35.465 --> 21:38.828
CAN YOU LET ME
TALK TO HER?

21:38.828 --> 21:40.600
YEAH.

21:49.739 --> 21:52.482
(speaking inaudibly)
SHE SEEMS NICE, RIGHT?

21:52.482 --> 21:53.683
OH, THE WOMAN?
YEAH.

21:53.683 --> 21:56.085
OH, I-I DON'T KNOW.
I...

21:56.085 --> 21:58.548
OKAY, I TRIED
TO CHECK HER OUT,

21:58.548 --> 22:00.820
BUT I JUST... (chuckles)
THERE WASN'T A GOOD ENOUGH

22:00.820 --> 22:03.593
REASON FOR ME TO STAY
IN THE ROOM. (chuckles)

22:03.593 --> 22:05.995
IT IS STRANGE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION.

22:05.995 --> 22:09.098
MY WIFE AND I LOOKING
FOR A FEMALE COMPANION

22:09.098 --> 22:10.430
FOR HER LOVER.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.001
YEAH, IT'S A FIRST
FOR ME. (chuckles)

22:12.001 --> 22:13.933
EH, YOU'RE YOUNG.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.064
(elevator bell dings)

22:15.064 --> 22:17.066
UH, DONNA AND I
HAD A WONDERFUL MARRIAGE

22:17.066 --> 22:19.639
FOR 30 YEARS.

22:19.639 --> 22:22.412
AND THEN THE FIRE
WENT AWAY.

22:22.412 --> 22:25.445
AND WE BOTH FOUND
OTHER PEOPLE.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.918
BUT SHE WAS STILL
MY BEST FRIEND.

22:28.918 --> 22:31.350
WE SOMEHOW BOTH HATED
THE IDEA

22:31.350 --> 22:33.883
OF DIVORCING EACH OTHER.

22:33.883 --> 22:37.727
SO NOW YOU'RE HELPING HER
PICK SOMEBODY FOR...

22:37.727 --> 22:38.928
STAN.
STAN.

22:38.928 --> 22:42.061
HE--HE'S NEVER BEEN IN LOVE
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.994
SHE'S AFRAID HE'S GONNA
BE ALONE FOREVER.

22:44.994 --> 22:47.366
HE'S--
HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.999
WE--WE PLAYED GOLF TOGETHER
FOR YEARS.
(chuckles)

22:49.999 --> 22:52.772
(sighs) I DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIM ALONE EITHER.

22:57.907 --> 23:02.552
YOU TOLD
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY

23:02.552 --> 23:04.954
THAT I HAVE
A PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION?

23:04.954 --> 23:06.155
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

23:06.155 --> 23:08.057
DEREK AND I WERE TALKING--
WHERE THE HELL DO YOU GET...

23:08.057 --> 23:10.059
ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
IS A FEW DAYS.

23:10.059 --> 23:13.122
TAKE A BREAK! FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MANAGE THIS.

23:13.122 --> 23:15.495
STAY OUT OF MY--

23:15.495 --> 23:17.527
BENCH YOURSELF,

23:17.527 --> 23:19.699
OR THE CHIEF WILL.

23:22.772 --> 23:24.604
MIRANDA...

23:27.807 --> 23:30.079
YOU SEND YOUR LACKEY
TO TELL MY LACKEY?

23:30.079 --> 23:32.041
YOU CAN'T TELL ME TO MY FACE
YOU'RE DESTROYING MY STUDY?

23:32.041 --> 23:33.643
YOU KNOW I'M NOT
DESTROYING YOUR STUDY--

23:33.643 --> 23:35.545
IF I DON'T FINISH THIS PHASE
BY THE END OF THIS WEEK,

23:35.545 --> 23:37.717
I LOSE MY FUNDING.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.418
COME WITH ME.

23:41.751 --> 23:43.853
PLEASE.

23:46.996 --> 23:50.560
(monitor beeping steadily)

23:50.560 --> 23:53.002
THAT'S NATHAN.
HE'S A REAL BABY.

23:53.002 --> 23:55.434
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.638
THAT'S ASHLEY, HIS MOM.
HE HAS A VERY NICE FATHER.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.511
THIS ISN'T A STUDY, MEREDITH.
THIS IS A BABY.

24:01.511 --> 24:03.112
NATHAN IS THE FIRST ONE
IN HIS FAMILY

24:03.112 --> 24:04.173
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO GO
TO COLLEGE.

24:04.173 --> 24:05.174
I MEAN, HE'S A BABY.

24:05.174 --> 24:06.215
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

24:06.215 --> 24:08.217
DO YOU THINK THAT
BECAUSE I HAVE KIDS,

24:08.217 --> 24:10.920
EVERY TIME I SEE A CHILD,
I'M GONNA START LACTATING

24:10.920 --> 24:13.082
AND LOSE MY ABILITY
TO REASON?
NO, I--

24:13.082 --> 24:14.223
YOU WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING FLASHY

24:14.223 --> 24:15.825
WITH THE EQUIPMENT.
IT DIDN'T WORK.

24:15.825 --> 24:18.928
NOW YOU WANT ME
TO SHUT DOWN MY ENTIRE STUDY,

24:18.928 --> 24:21.060
SO THAT YOU CAN RUN
A HAIL MARY

24:21.060 --> 24:22.832
THAT VERY WELL MIGHT KILL
THIS VERY CUTE CHILD.

24:22.832 --> 24:26.035
BABY NATHAN AND ALL
OF HIS COLLEGE POTENTIAL,

24:26.035 --> 24:28.738
CAN GET
AN ARTIFICIAL GRAFT--
NO.

24:28.738 --> 24:30.970
LIKE EVERY OTHER
H.L.H.S. BABY--

24:30.970 --> 24:32.041
NO, HE CAN'T.

24:32.041 --> 24:34.203
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
MAKE IT WORK.

24:37.006 --> 24:38.978
HOW MANY PEOPLE?

24:38.978 --> 24:39.979
(door closes)
WE MIGHT BE UP TO 16.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.151
BUT SOME OF THEM ARE KIDS,
AND THEY BARELY EAT.

24:42.151 --> 24:44.013
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
DINNER FOR FOUR.

24:44.013 --> 24:45.014
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

24:45.014 --> 24:46.916
IT JUST KINDA GOT
OUT OF HAND.

24:46.916 --> 24:48.588
WE CAN ALL
JUST COOK TOGETHER.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.989
I THOUGHT MEREDITH DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO TURN ON AN OVEN.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.491
(chuckles)
WELL, THE REST OF US.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.993
I'LL DO ALL THE SHOPPING.
I'LL DO ALL THE PLANNING.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.024
I WILL DO EVERYTHING,

24:55.024 --> 24:56.996
AND YOU JUST GET TO
SHOUT OUT ORDERS.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.928
(chuckles) OKAY, IT'S STARTING
TO SOUND BETTER.
OKAY.

24:58.928 --> 25:01.771
GOOD.

25:03.973 --> 25:07.206
SO... MAYBE I SHOULD QUIT
WHILE I'M AHEAD BUT, UM...

25:07.206 --> 25:08.277
WHAT?

25:08.277 --> 25:10.209
(clears throat)
CRISTINA ISN'T...

25:10.209 --> 25:12.281
(sighs) SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THANKSGIVING PLANS.

25:12.281 --> 25:14.183
I MEAN,
JUST AS A FRIEND...

25:14.183 --> 25:15.885
I, UH...

25:15.885 --> 25:17.887
YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ANYTHING. JUST FORGET IT.

25:17.887 --> 25:19.148
NO, OWEN. IT'S OKAY.

25:19.148 --> 25:21.591
IF YOU SAY YOU'RE OVER HER,
I BELIEVE YOU.

25:21.591 --> 25:23.152
AND REALLY, IT'S UP
TO MEREDITH AND DEREK

25:23.152 --> 25:24.694
'CAUSE IT'S THEIR HOUSE.

25:24.694 --> 25:25.995
ARE YOU SURE?

25:25.995 --> 25:29.058
YOU KNOW, I WANT YOU
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

25:29.058 --> 25:32.101
WELL, I'M GONNA BE COOKING
FOR WHAT COULD BE,

25:32.101 --> 25:34.063
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
30 PEOPLE, SO...

25:34.063 --> 25:36.535
(chuckles)
I WON'T HAVE TIME
TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.907
OKAY.
(knock on door)

25:42.642 --> 25:45.815
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA SPEAK
TO HER ABOUT THE STUFFING.

25:45.815 --> 25:48.077
YOU THINK SHE COULD HANDLE
A DEEP FRIED TURKEY?

25:48.077 --> 25:49.819
I MEAN,
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.

25:49.819 --> 25:52.181
DON'T PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES
TRYING TO MAKE THOSE?

25:52.181 --> 25:54.123
EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE.
(scoffs)

25:54.123 --> 25:58.728
YOU GUYS, MY PATIENT
HAS A HUSBAND AND A LOVER.

25:58.728 --> 26:00.930
AND SHE AND THE HUSBAND
ARE INTERVIEWING WOMEN

26:00.930 --> 26:02.992
FOR THE LOVER TO DATE
WHEN SHE'S DEAD.

26:02.992 --> 26:05.094
WHEN THE PATIENT'S DEAD?
IT'S WEIRD.

26:05.094 --> 26:07.036
IS THAT
LIKE A THREESOME THING?

26:07.036 --> 26:08.097
(chuckles) DR. WEBBER!

26:08.097 --> 26:10.269
I'M JUST ASKING A QUESTION.
(laughs)

26:10.269 --> 26:11.741
YOU HIDING FROM GREY AGAIN?

26:12.942 --> 26:14.103
(clears throat)

26:14.103 --> 26:16.145
ON YOUR WAY, EDWARDS.

26:16.145 --> 26:17.607
(typing)

26:17.607 --> 26:20.810
I NEED YOU TO TAKE OVER
BAILEY'S SURGICAL LOAD TODAY.

26:20.810 --> 26:23.753
I CAN'T.
MY STUDY IS FALLING APART,

26:23.753 --> 26:25.584
AND I HAVE A PALLIATIVE SURGERY
LATER TODAY. I--

26:25.584 --> 26:27.286
MEREDITH.

26:27.286 --> 26:30.660
(telephone rings)

26:30.660 --> 26:32.692
(Callie) YOU EVER DONE
AN EX-FIX BEFORE, MURPHY?

26:32.692 --> 26:33.893
(Leah) NO.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.765
HMM. TRY IT.

26:35.765 --> 26:40.069
YEAH. RIGHT THERE.

26:40.069 --> 26:41.170
NOW THE FIRST CORTEX
IS HARD.

26:41.170 --> 26:42.932
THEN IT'LL FEEL SPONGY
IN THE MIDDLE,

26:42.932 --> 26:44.774
AND THEN HARD AGAIN WHEN YOU
HIT THE SECOND CORTEX, OKAY?

26:44.774 --> 26:47.637
(whirring)
THAT'S IT.

26:47.637 --> 26:49.639
REALLY PUSH THROUGH.

26:49.639 --> 26:50.910
UH, OKAY. IT FEELS SPONGY.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.782
OKAY, EASE UP A BIT NOW.

26:52.782 --> 26:54.684
(whirring stops)
NOW THE PITCH'LL CHANGE
WHEN YOU HIT THE CORTEX, OKAY?

26:54.684 --> 26:55.715
CAN YOU HEAR IT?

26:55.715 --> 26:57.717
(whirring resumes)

26:57.717 --> 27:01.120
(whirring grows louder, squish)
OH, MY GOD.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.053
OKAY, YOU DRILLED RIGHT
THROUGH HER LEG INTO THE TABLE.
OH, MY GOD!

27:04.053 --> 27:06.095
NO, IT'S--BACK IT UP.
JUST PUT THE DRILL IN REVERSE.

27:06.095 --> 27:08.097
I-I CAN'T--
PUT THE DRILL IN REVERSE!

27:08.097 --> 27:09.799
I CAN'T FIND THE--
CAN YOU JUST TAKE IT?

27:09.799 --> 27:10.860
MY HAND IS SHAKING.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

27:10.860 --> 27:11.961
PULL IT TOGETHER--
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST--

27:11.961 --> 27:13.632
MURPHY, PULL IT TOGETHER.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.334
(instrument whirs)
OH, PLEASE!

27:15.334 --> 27:19.168
MURPHY!
CAN YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING?

27:19.168 --> 27:22.111
(Arizona) CALLIE,
CAN YOU TAKE IT YOURSELF?

27:22.111 --> 27:23.973
JUST GIVE HER A FEW MINUTES
TO CALM DOWN.

27:23.973 --> 27:25.915
WELL--

27:25.915 --> 27:27.977
(breathing heavily)

27:27.977 --> 27:31.380
(monitor beeping steadily)

27:33.683 --> 27:37.156
IT WAS HER?

27:37.156 --> 27:40.029
TEN-PLUS TIMES!
THAT WAS HER?

27:47.867 --> 27:50.770
(sighs) THAT IS JUST...
(object thuds)

27:50.770 --> 27:52.001
PERFECT.

27:52.001 --> 27:53.242
(whirring resumes)

27:53.242 --> 27:54.303
(whirring stops)
(sighs)

28:01.951 --> 28:03.212
WHY WOULD YOU TELL HER?

28:03.212 --> 28:04.213
I DIDN'T. I-I-I-I TOLD HER
IT WAS SOMEONE.

28:04.213 --> 28:06.355
I DIDN'T SAY WHO.
I MEAN, LISTEN,

28:06.355 --> 28:07.987
SHE FIGURED IT OUT BECAUSE
YOU FELL APART IN THERE.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.258
YOU COULD'VE JUST
FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT

28:09.258 --> 28:10.920
AND GONE ON
WITH YOUR HAPPY LIFE.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.391
THIS IS MY MARRIAGE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

28:12.391 --> 28:15.925
YEAH, AND IT'S MY CAREER!
SHE HATES ME NOW.
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

28:15.925 --> 28:17.867
OH, PLEASE.
OF COURSE SHE DOES.

28:17.867 --> 28:19.799
SHE CAN'T BLAME YOU.
SHE LOVES YOU.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.700
THE ONLY ONE
SHE CAN BLAME IS ME.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.877
HEY...

28:27.877 --> 28:30.339
SO YOU REALIZE THAT
STEPHANIE AND I ARE SERIOUS,

28:30.339 --> 28:31.841
RIGHT? YOU GET THAT?

28:31.841 --> 28:33.112
YEAH, YEAH.
UH-HUH, GREAT.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.414
I THINK IT'S NICE THAT
YOU GUYS ARE, YOU KNOW...

28:35.414 --> 28:37.486
WHATEVER YOU ARE.
(elevator bell dings)

28:37.486 --> 28:39.188
RIGHT, SO--

28:39.188 --> 28:40.319
SO WHY IS IT THAT YOU
INVITED HER TO YOUR WEDDING

28:40.319 --> 28:42.351
PLUS A GUEST
AND YOU'RE GONNA INVITE ME

28:42.351 --> 28:44.393
PLUS A GUEST?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:44.393 --> 28:47.296
RIGHT, YEAH. UM, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

28:47.296 --> 28:49.498
YOU ARE ACTUALLY NOT
GETTING AN INVITATION,

28:49.498 --> 28:52.731
BUT STEPHANIE IS, SO YOU
COULD JUST BE HER PLUS ONE.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.203
(telephone rings)
MM-HMM.

28:54.203 --> 28:56.465
LOOK, I PUT YOUR NAME
ON THE INVITE LIST.

28:56.465 --> 28:59.508
YOUR NAME IS AVERY.
WE DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER A's.

28:59.508 --> 29:01.740
YOU'RE LITERALLY
THE TOP OF THE LIST,

29:01.740 --> 29:03.072
FIRST THING WE SEE
WHEN WE LOOK AT IT.

29:03.072 --> 29:04.743
I JUST...

29:04.743 --> 29:08.517
I DIDN'T WANNA... RUB IT
IN MATTHEW'S FACE.

29:08.517 --> 29:10.449
(scoffs)
IF HE HAS A PROBLEM

29:10.449 --> 29:12.351
WITH MY NAME
ON A PIECE OF PAPER,

29:12.351 --> 29:14.253
WHY SHOULD I BE
AT THIS WEDDING?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.885
BECAUSE OF ME.

29:15.885 --> 29:19.158
BECAUSE... YOU'RE MY FRIEND
AND I WANT YOU TO BE THERE.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.391
YEAH.

29:22.391 --> 29:26.135
YEAH, WELL,
I WANNA BE THERE, TOO, BUT...

29:26.135 --> 29:27.236
(whispers) COME ON...

29:27.236 --> 29:31.770
JACKSON, I CAN'T GO
THROUGH WITH THIS

29:31.770 --> 29:33.442
IF I DON'T HAVE
YOUR BLESSING.

29:36.505 --> 29:39.408
WELL, YOU HAVE IT.

29:39.408 --> 29:40.910
ALL RIGHT, BUT...

29:40.910 --> 29:43.412
I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD BE THERE.

29:47.386 --> 29:50.189
DR. GREY WAS PULLED
INTO AN EMERGENCY SURGERY.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.021
SO WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO PUSH
MRS. KAUFMAN'S PROCEDURE

29:52.021 --> 29:54.423
TO TOMORROW. I--
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

29:54.423 --> 29:56.465
I APOLOGIZE.
I'LL BE OVER HERE.

29:58.828 --> 30:01.901
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY
DATE THE WOMAN SHE CHOOSES.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.033
I DON'T WANNA DATE
ANY WOMAN!

30:05.434 --> 30:07.877
THAT'S WHY
SHE'S DOING THIS, STAN.

30:07.877 --> 30:09.408
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
TALK HER OUT OF IT.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.280
YOU NEED TO TELL HER
YOURSELF.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.282
YOU'RE BOTH PUTTING ME
IN THE MIDDLE.

30:13.282 --> 30:14.884
BECAUSE SHE LISTENS TO YOU.

30:14.884 --> 30:16.545
SHE DOESN'T
LISTEN TO ANYONE!

30:16.545 --> 30:22.151
BESIDES, THIS IS NOT
SUCH A TERRIBLE IDEA.

30:22.151 --> 30:25.554
I'M NOT A CHILD SHE HAS
TO ARRANGE DAYCARE FOR!

30:25.554 --> 30:28.057
A BUNCH OF WOMEN
SHE SCARED UP ON THE INTERNET?

30:28.057 --> 30:29.298
THIS IS... IT'S AWFUL.

30:29.298 --> 30:32.431
IT'S TAKING HER MIND OFF
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.503
THAT CAN'T BE THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD.

30:34.503 --> 30:36.465
SHE THINKS SHE CAN FIND
SOMEONE TO REPLACE HER?

30:38.267 --> 30:42.411
(voice breaking)
YOU CAN'T... REPLACE HER.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.445
(crying)

30:46.445 --> 30:51.450
NOBODY CAN POSSIBLY
REPLACE... HER.

30:51.450 --> 30:55.454
(sobbing) WHY?

30:55.454 --> 30:57.156
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

30:57.156 --> 31:00.159
(continues sobbing)

31:01.390 --> 31:02.631
HE'S DESATTED TO 60.

31:02.631 --> 31:05.264
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS THING,
WE GOTTA DO IT NOW.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.136
I CAN'T. I DON'T HAVE
A CONDUIT TO PUT IN HIM.

31:07.136 --> 31:09.038
IT WON'T BE DONE
FOR ANOTHER SIX HOURS.

31:09.038 --> 31:11.470
I DON'T KNOW IF
HE'S GONNA LAST THAT LONG.
OKAY.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.372
OKAY, LET'S PUT HIM
ON AN OSCILLATOR.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.504
IT WILL STABILIZE HIS SATS
FOR EASILY A DAY.

31:15.504 --> 31:17.276
I DON'T WANNA WAIT A DAY,
CRISTINA.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.547
NO, NEITHER DO I, ALEX.

31:18.547 --> 31:20.649
BUT IN THE LONG RUN,
IT'S STILL HIS BEST CHANCE.

31:20.649 --> 31:21.951
(gate clinks)

31:24.553 --> 31:28.287
(machine beeping)

31:28.287 --> 31:31.560
(machine whirring)
OKAY.

31:35.664 --> 31:38.327
WELL, THANKS TO YOU,

31:38.327 --> 31:40.199
MY RESIDENT OFFERED
TO SERVICE ME.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.430
WHAT?

31:41.430 --> 31:43.402
DRIVE ME AROUND THE BLOCK
BEFORE MY BATTERY DIES.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.534
AH. YOU GONNA DO IT?

31:45.534 --> 31:46.635
SHANE? NO.

31:46.635 --> 31:49.178
IT'LL BE LIKE HAVING SEX
WITH A BABY SEAL.

31:49.178 --> 31:53.282
(machine beeps)

31:53.282 --> 31:54.313
SATS ARE BETTER.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.046
(sighs) GOOD.

31:57.046 --> 31:59.388
WHY DON'T YOU
TALK TO MEREDITH?

31:59.388 --> 32:00.950
EXPLAIN THAT EVERYTHING
IS GONNA BE FINE.

32:00.950 --> 32:02.051
MAYBE SHE'LL CUT ME
SOME SLACK.

32:02.051 --> 32:03.993
SHE'S GOT A POINT.
WHICH IS WHAT?

32:03.993 --> 32:05.354
YOU COULD PUT IN
AN ARTIFICIAL GRAFT.

32:05.354 --> 32:06.925
WE TRIED.
HE REJECTED IT.

32:06.925 --> 32:07.997
SO TRY AGAIN.

32:07.997 --> 32:09.028
PUMP HIM FULL OF MEDS,

32:09.028 --> 32:10.359
HOLD HIM OVER
FOR A COUPLE YEARS...

32:10.359 --> 32:12.401
(gate clinks)
UNTIL YOUR BRAND-NEW
PROCEDURE'S OLD NEWS,

32:12.401 --> 32:13.932
TESTED HUNDREDS OF TIMES.
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.564
YOU WANNA FIGHT
A DIFFERENT BATTLE,

32:15.564 --> 32:17.506
THAT'S YOUR OWN PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALEX.

32:17.506 --> 32:20.469
THIS IS MY PROBLEM.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.013
YOUR HEART RATE'S
PRETTY HIGH.

32:24.013 --> 32:25.344
KEEP GOING. I'M FINE.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.376
(breathing heavily)

32:27.376 --> 32:28.377
THIS IS WHEN WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE IT UP A NOTCH.

32:28.377 --> 32:31.950
BUT I'M NOT SURE--
WILSON, I'M GONNA HURT YOU.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.624
(beeps)

32:35.624 --> 32:38.027
DR. WEBBER, I DON'T THINK
THAT WE--
NO!

32:38.027 --> 32:39.628
TAKE IT UP AGAIN!

32:42.591 --> 32:44.393
WILSON!
(beeping)

32:47.436 --> 32:49.298
(beeping)

32:49.298 --> 32:50.639
(breathing heavily)

32:50.639 --> 32:53.272
OH, MY GOD!

32:53.272 --> 32:55.744
I NEED SOME HELP HERE!
DR. SHEPHERD!

32:55.744 --> 32:56.745
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:56.745 --> 32:59.078
(groaning)

32:59.078 --> 33:02.581
(monitor beeping steadily)

33:09.188 --> 33:10.989
(door slides open)

33:10.989 --> 33:13.722
(clears throat)

33:13.722 --> 33:16.695
DR. BAILEY, COULD WE SPEAK
FOR A MOMENT?

33:16.695 --> 33:18.397
UH, I'M ABOUT
TO GET STARTED HERE.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.569
WHY DON'T I TRACK YOU DOWN
WHEN I'M DONE?

33:20.569 --> 33:22.431
THIS IS A CONVERSATION
WE SHOULD HAVE NOW.

33:22.431 --> 33:25.104
DR. GREY CAN TAKE OVER.

33:27.436 --> 33:30.509
DR. BAILEY--
I WILL SPEAK TO YOU
WHEN I AM FINISHED HERE.

33:38.417 --> 33:41.190
DO YOU MIND?

33:41.190 --> 33:44.353
(sighs) DR. GREY, PLEASE MOVE
DR. BAILEY'S BOVIE

33:44.353 --> 33:45.424
ONE INCH TO THE LEFT.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.025
OH, DON'T TOUCH--

33:57.466 --> 33:59.338
(whispers) GREY...

33:59.338 --> 34:02.511
AND MOVE THE SUCTION
ONE INCH DOWN.

34:02.511 --> 34:04.273
GET AWAY FROM MY--
MAYBE EVEN 4--

34:04.273 --> 34:05.444
GET AWAY FROM MY TABLE!

34:22.761 --> 34:24.293
(exhales)

34:37.376 --> 34:39.148
BRUISING OVER
THE CHEST WALL.
I NEED A PORTABLE
ULTRASOUND.

34:39.148 --> 34:41.250
I DON'T NEED AN ULTRASOUND.
MY RIB'S BROKEN.
HIS PULSE OX IS LOW.

34:41.250 --> 34:43.152
(door opens)
(Callie)
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

34:43.152 --> 34:44.413
PLEASE, DON'T.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.655

MY KID.

35:42.511 --> 35:45.214

WHY AREN'T WE GOING
TO THE WEDDING?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.781
(sighs) BECAUSE MY NAME
STARTS WITH "A."

36:22.781 --> 36:24.913
BECAUSE APRIL IS NEUROTIC.
BECAUSE MATTHEW AND I

36:24.913 --> 36:27.286
DO NOT HUG, AND NO,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE COMFORTABLE.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.417
