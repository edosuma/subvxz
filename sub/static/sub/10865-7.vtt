00:29.620 --> 00:33.220
So, what happens
if he doesn't show?

00:33.220 --> 00:35.380
He'll show.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.060
What if he doesn't?

00:37.060 --> 00:39.740
No problem.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.980
Come on, guys, no fighting.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.100
The rules say no fighting,
so no fighting.

00:48.100 --> 00:51.020
So, Gar, what's your story
about tonight?

00:51.020 --> 00:52.140
It's about magic.

00:52.140 --> 00:55.020
I love magic, and you do, too,
because I'm the boss,

00:55.020 --> 00:57.060
and the rules say you
gotta like what I like.

00:57.060 --> 00:59.580
Yeah, we hear
you like Samantha.

00:59.580 --> 01:02.580
Stig!
Samantha, what a babe.

01:02.580 --> 01:05.019
I have a picture of her
in my room.

01:05.019 --> 01:06.140
It's right next to my bed.

01:06.140 --> 01:08.820
In fact, I declare
this meeting closed

01:08.820 --> 01:11.460
so I can go home and
look at it right--

01:11.460 --> 01:12.660
(laughter)

01:14.940 --> 01:15.660
Uh-oh.

01:19.700 --> 01:24.060
You know, I'm not even mad,
'cause Tucker just

01:24.060 --> 01:25.820
proved a point for my story.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.900
I did?
Yep.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.220
You just proved that everyone
has a special talent.

01:31.220 --> 01:34.180
In your case, it's being
a complete idiot.

01:34.180 --> 01:35.620
(all laugh)

01:35.620 --> 01:38.380
But everybody else has
a positive talent

01:38.380 --> 01:39.380
that makes them special.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.420
Some people sing,
others are really smart.

01:41.420 --> 01:43.340
Some draw, some play
an instrument.

01:43.340 --> 01:46.660
But those are all
obvious talents.

01:46.660 --> 01:48.780
Some people have talents
that are hidden,

01:48.780 --> 01:55.300
waiting for someone
or something to bring them out.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.540
If you're one of those people,

01:59.540 --> 02:02.460
you better hope that when
you find your talent,

02:02.460 --> 02:04.660
it's something
you can control,

02:04.660 --> 02:08.220
or it might control you.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.420
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:12.420 --> 02:17.140
I call this story...

02:17.140 --> 02:21.420
"The Tale of Badge."

02:21.420 --> 02:22.940
Oh, it's coming!

02:22.940 --> 02:26.540
Oh, isn't it
a grand cake?

02:26.540 --> 02:28.580
Oh, happy birthday.
Thanks.

02:28.580 --> 02:31.620
Everybody ready?
Smile.

02:31.620 --> 02:34.700
Now blow it out.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.180
Hey, I did it!

02:37.180 --> 02:37.660
Hey!

02:37.660 --> 02:39.620
Science Fair,
first place, baby.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.420
That's wonderful.

02:41.420 --> 02:44.380
That's fantastic.

02:59.020 --> 03:03.300
We'll have none of that, now.
Behave yourself.

03:10.980 --> 03:11.500
¶¶

03:22.620 --> 03:23.860
(knock on door)

03:23.860 --> 03:25.300
Yeah?

03:25.300 --> 03:27.460
Care for an old
woman's company?

03:27.460 --> 03:30.380
You're not so old.

03:32.340 --> 03:37.060
I'm old enough to know when
someone has troubles.

03:37.060 --> 03:38.540
It's no big deal.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.860
It's just that
it's my birthday,

03:39.860 --> 03:41.580
and sometimes
I feel like,

03:41.580 --> 03:42.820
you know, it doesn't
really matter.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.380
Has this got something
to do with a certain

03:45.380 --> 03:46.980
blue ribbon brother?

03:46.980 --> 03:47.740
No!

03:50.580 --> 03:51.580
Yes.

03:52.420 --> 03:55.460
How come he got
all the brains,

03:55.460 --> 03:57.460
<i> and all I get
is ordinary?</i>

03:57.460 --> 04:00.620
You're anything
but ordinary, my dear,

04:00.620 --> 04:04.900
and your birthday's very,
very important...

04:04.900 --> 04:06.580
especially this one.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.420
Happy birthday.

04:11.180 --> 04:11.740
Thanks, Willy.

04:11.740 --> 04:16.540
My grandmother gave me this
chest on my 16th birthday,

04:16.540 --> 04:20.980
as did her grandmother
before her.

04:20.980 --> 04:22.300
But this...

04:24.980 --> 04:28.220
is yours, and yours alone.

04:30.060 --> 04:33.220
It's very special,
just like you.

04:33.220 --> 04:35.100
It's like yours.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.220
It's called a "Jasper."

04:37.220 --> 04:38.420
I love it.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.100
Thanks, Willy.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.300
You're very welcome.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.340
And now I want you
to see something.

04:47.340 --> 04:49.260
This book--

04:49.260 --> 04:51.460
(knock on door)
Gwen?

04:53.020 --> 04:55.460
I just had a call from
your band instructor.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.140
What's the matter?

04:57.140 --> 04:59.060
Gwen quit the band today.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.660
Oh, Gwen, no.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.140
I wasn't any good.

05:02.140 --> 05:03.580
Oh, you couldn't be
more wrong.

05:03.580 --> 05:07.780
Music is your gift.
I know.

05:07.780 --> 05:08.540
You must develop it.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.700
Your instructor wants to meet
with your father and me

05:11.700 --> 05:13.460
after the parents
conference tonight,

05:13.460 --> 05:16.860
so I'll need you
to watch Trevor.

05:16.860 --> 05:19.020
Tonight?
Mm-hmm.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.140
Willy, will you babysit,
please, please?

05:22.140 --> 05:27.620
Oh, sorry, lass,
Ladies' Club meeting tonight.

05:28.420 --> 05:31.940
We'll talk about
this tomorrow.

05:31.940 --> 05:35.220
Mom, I have a party
tonight I gotta go to.

05:35.220 --> 05:36.140
Well, Gwen, I'm sorry.

05:36.140 --> 05:39.580
There just isn't any time
to get anyone else.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.620
(Willy)
Behave yourself!

06:10.300 --> 06:14.420
Come on, we're gonna be late.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.780
We'll be home around 10:00,

06:15.780 --> 06:17.820
but Willy should be home
about 8:00.

06:17.820 --> 06:19.780
Okay.
And when she comes home,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.580
you can go to
that party, okay?

06:24.900 --> 06:25.820
Really?

06:25.820 --> 06:28.940
Well, I'm not a total ogre.

06:28.940 --> 06:29.460
Thanks, mom.

06:29.460 --> 06:32.420
Happy birthday, sweetie.
Thanks, dad.

06:32.420 --> 06:34.420
(horn honks)
Oh, that's my ride.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.660
I'll be back at 8:00 sharp.

06:36.660 --> 06:42.620
<i>And as for you,
primum non nocere.</i>

06:42.620 --> 06:45.060
What does that mean?

06:45.060 --> 06:47.460
First, do no harm.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.260
See you at 8:00.

06:49.260 --> 06:51.780
Yeah, bye.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.500
I don't care what
you do, Greek boy,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.540
just stay outta my face.

06:58.540 --> 07:02.300
It wasn't Greek,
it was Latin.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.300
Ugh!

07:11.060 --> 07:13.700
Hi, Di?
Hi, it's me.

07:37.980 --> 07:42.420
If I'm lucky, he'll do an
experiment and blow himself up.

07:49.980 --> 07:53.300
(sustained note)

07:53.300 --> 07:55.780
(note echoing)

07:58.820 --> 07:59.660
Trevor?

08:01.940 --> 08:04.020
Trevor?

08:14.820 --> 08:16.220
What are you doing
in here?

08:16.220 --> 08:20.100
I, uh, I thought I left some
microscope slides in here.

08:20.100 --> 08:20.780
Have you seen them?

08:20.780 --> 08:21.700
Yeah, right.
Get outta here.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.420
You shouldn't be touching
Willy's things.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.260
What was that sound?

08:26.260 --> 08:28.860
I didn't hear anything.

08:28.860 --> 08:31.780
Just say outta there.

08:31.780 --> 08:35.020
Yeah, yeah.

08:47.740 --> 08:51.740
So is Brian there yet?

08:58.380 --> 09:02.380
He brought Sally Smitts?

09:02.380 --> 09:05.900
I thought he didn't like her.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.300
(ground rumbling)

09:17.940 --> 09:20.140
Trevor?

09:20.140 --> 09:23.020
Oh, man, the power
just went out.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.620
Diane?
Hello?

09:39.940 --> 09:44.180
Trevor, come on, we gotta--

09:44.180 --> 09:46.660
(knock on door)

09:48.740 --> 09:50.180
Who's there?

09:50.180 --> 09:53.660
(man)
I'm looking for Setterwind.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.940
There's no one here
by that name.

09:55.940 --> 09:59.780
Wh-why don't you go next door?

10:02.220 --> 10:04.980
Come in, may I?

10:08.900 --> 10:09.860
An accident.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.420
There's been an accident.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.980
There's a gas station
a few blocks away.

10:14.980 --> 10:18.660
Y-you can get help there.

10:26.780 --> 10:28.700
In some kind of trouble,
are you?

10:28.700 --> 10:31.220
No.
No, we're fine.

10:31.220 --> 10:36.260
Then why are your lights out?

10:36.260 --> 10:38.900
Look, I'll call
the police for you,

10:38.900 --> 10:41.740
but I'm not letting you in.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.900
Gwen?

10:46.900 --> 10:47.660
Who was that?

10:47.660 --> 10:52.020
I don't think I want to know.

10:52.020 --> 10:55.780
(doorknob rattles)

10:58.220 --> 10:58.700
Who's there?

10:58.700 --> 11:03.300
(Willy's voice) Gwen, I
forgot my keys again, dear.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.740
(sighs)
Really?

11:05.740 --> 11:07.860
Are we glad to see you.

11:07.860 --> 11:10.580
(wicked laughter)
Aah! Aah!

11:12.900 --> 11:13.860
Returned has Badge.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.700
(wicked laughter)

11:25.980 --> 11:28.380
Setterwind.

11:28.380 --> 11:31.220
(laughing)

11:31.220 --> 11:32.180
<i>Not the Setterwind.</i>

11:38.220 --> 11:43.180
So, who are you?
What do you want?

11:43.180 --> 11:46.580
Badge, I am.

11:48.420 --> 11:49.940
Where is it?

11:49.940 --> 11:52.460
Let her go!

11:52.460 --> 11:55.220
Where is it?

11:55.220 --> 11:56.300
Where is what?

11:56.300 --> 11:58.740
The Setterwind.

11:58.740 --> 12:03.340
(evil laughter)

12:05.060 --> 12:06.020
Gwen!

12:06.020 --> 12:11.060
Bring me the Setterwind.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.460
(evil laughter)

12:19.660 --> 12:20.500
Trevor!

12:22.380 --> 12:23.220
Trevor?

12:36.540 --> 12:38.260
(screams)

12:44.580 --> 12:47.140
(Badge)
Six centuries.

12:47.140 --> 12:51.420
Six long centuries,

12:51.420 --> 12:57.900
Trapped in that wretched prison,
I was.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.820
Where are you?

13:06.140 --> 13:07.820
Aah!

13:07.820 --> 13:10.940
(evil laughter)

13:10.940 --> 13:12.660
Where's my brother?

13:12.660 --> 13:16.860
Bring me the Setterwind.

13:16.860 --> 13:21.020
Trade for it, I will.

13:21.020 --> 13:23.300
I don't have the Setterwind.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.380
I don't even know what one is.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.180
Young you are...

13:29.660 --> 13:35.580
kept me trapped,
the Setterwind did,

13:35.580 --> 13:39.140
for 12 lifetimes.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.500
But now free, I am.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.820
Setterwind magic is
no match for mine.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.380
(evil laughter)

13:49.380 --> 13:54.620
Hang and rot in my garden

13:54.620 --> 13:58.980
for what it has done to me.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.860
Now, return...

14:03.860 --> 14:05.180
and bring me
the Setterwind.

14:34.900 --> 14:40.620
Music...
Music is my gift.

15:07.180 --> 15:10.140
Celina Setterwind.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.300
"By darkest night,
I play the song,

15:13.300 --> 15:16.620
"to hold the beast in
moments long.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.660
"I call upon
the Jasper's light

15:18.660 --> 15:21.780
to bind the goblin
in Setterwind might."

15:36.900 --> 15:37.860
Willy!

15:37.860 --> 15:42.220
Willy's the Setterwind.

15:42.220 --> 15:46.660
He wants revenge on Willy.

15:46.660 --> 15:50.820
(gasps)
It's me.

16:06.580 --> 16:11.460
My gosh, I don't believe this.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.500
The Jasper's light.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.580
To bind the goblin.

16:19.940 --> 16:23.180
I better be right about this.

16:31.180 --> 16:31.900
Hello?

16:34.580 --> 16:35.300
Badge?

16:37.420 --> 16:39.540
I'm back.

16:50.420 --> 16:51.140
Badge?

16:54.340 --> 16:58.740
Show yourself.

16:58.740 --> 17:00.020
Fine!

17:04.180 --> 17:06.980
I-I want my brother back.

17:06.980 --> 17:08.940
Where's the Setterwind?

17:08.940 --> 17:11.780
And I'm not gonna
let you hurt Willy!

17:11.780 --> 17:13.900
(evil laughter)

17:15.780 --> 17:17.740
I call upon
the Jasper's light

17:17.740 --> 17:22.060
to bind the goblin
in Setterwind might.

17:25.500 --> 17:29.340
No.
(evil laughter)

17:29.340 --> 17:31.300
Young you are.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.420
Setterwind power
not yet strong.

17:34.420 --> 17:39.340
I call upon
the Jasper's light...

17:44.580 --> 17:47.740
Hang, you will,
in my garden.

17:47.740 --> 17:48.500
No!

17:49.860 --> 17:51.620
(screams)

17:53.700 --> 17:54.900
(growling)

17:59.860 --> 18:00.780
Gwen!

18:00.780 --> 18:02.460
(Willy)
Trevor!

18:05.300 --> 18:07.460
The Setterwind.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.620
Play the song, Gwen.

18:14.620 --> 18:18.100
Music is your gift--
the song.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.020
Willy?

18:30.900 --> 18:31.620
Willy?

18:33.460 --> 18:38.220
Play the song.
What song?

18:40.700 --> 18:43.060
Okay, music is my gift.

18:43.060 --> 18:46.860
What is the song?

18:46.860 --> 18:48.620
Badge.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.820
B-A-D-G-E.

18:52.820 --> 18:56.380
Music notes!

18:57.980 --> 19:01.780
Long have I been waiting

19:01.780 --> 19:02.860
for this, Setterwind.

19:07.420 --> 19:10.780
Then I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

19:10.780 --> 19:11.500
No.

19:14.660 --> 19:16.740
Disappoint me,

19:16.740 --> 19:18.300
you will not.

19:29.620 --> 19:36.300
Mine, the Jasper will be...

19:36.300 --> 19:42.020
along with
the Setterwind magic.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.380
Life...
there's none.

19:54.540 --> 19:58.580
No power has the Jasper.

19:58.580 --> 19:59.580
Why?

20:02.620 --> 20:03.100
¶¶

20:06.220 --> 20:07.780
(musical note reverberating)

20:07.780 --> 20:10.500
I'm afraid you're too late.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.340
The power's no longer mine.

20:13.340 --> 20:13.860
¶¶

20:18.460 --> 20:19.300
(gasps)

20:21.100 --> 20:27.140
You see, I passed the gift
to my granddaughter.

20:29.420 --> 20:29.940
¶¶

20:31.900 --> 20:34.780
(earth rumbling)

20:34.780 --> 20:35.740
(crying out)

20:35.740 --> 20:36.980
And you, my friend--

20:36.980 --> 20:39.180
you're going back
in the box.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.060
¶¶

20:43.380 --> 20:44.820
(crying out)

20:49.420 --> 20:49.940
¶¶

21:02.060 --> 21:05.500
Don't mess with a Setterwind.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.860
Gwen?

21:06.860 --> 21:08.100
Trevor!

21:08.100 --> 21:10.980
Are you okay?
Yeah.

21:10.980 --> 21:13.420
I knew you'd come through
for me.

21:13.420 --> 21:15.620
Where's Willy?

21:15.620 --> 21:19.100
Right here.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.020
And Badge?

21:21.820 --> 21:25.020
Back where he belongs,
I see.

21:25.020 --> 21:29.780
Willy, I don't think I really
understand what happened.

21:29.780 --> 21:33.020
Oh, you will, child.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.700
The Setterwind magic
has been handed down

21:35.700 --> 21:37.980
from grandmother to
granddaughter for centuries.

21:37.980 --> 21:42.780
But with that magic comes
a grave responsibility.

21:42.780 --> 21:46.660
We're the guardians
of this box

21:46.660 --> 21:50.060
and the monster inside of it.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.860
That's the evil part
of our magic

21:52.860 --> 21:56.180
that will never be
released.

21:58.940 --> 21:59.780
That's it?

21:59.780 --> 22:01.020
My sister's some kind
of witch?

22:01.020 --> 22:04.820
And all she gets to do is
babysit a boogeyman in a box?

22:04.820 --> 22:06.100
That's weak.

22:06.100 --> 22:09.700
Can she do magic stuff
and cast spells and...

22:09.700 --> 22:11.100
(Willy humming)

22:11.100 --> 22:14.180
come out of boxes and make
herself really small,

22:14.180 --> 22:15.700
and come in a cloud
of smoke,

22:15.700 --> 22:21.180
and-- and change
into things and-- and...

22:21.180 --> 22:24.940
Hi, Willy.
What's in the box?

22:24.940 --> 22:28.260
Nothing for a nosy little boy.

22:28.260 --> 22:32.180
But I do believe there's some
ice cream in the freezer.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.500
Yes!

22:37.460 --> 22:39.460
You made him forget!

22:39.460 --> 22:42.940
You touched him,
and he forgot.

22:45.620 --> 22:49.420
There are many things to know
about the Setterwind magic,

22:49.420 --> 22:52.980
and you'll learn them all.

22:56.020 --> 22:56.700
Happy birthday, Gwen.

22:56.700 --> 23:01.580
You're indeed
a very special girl.

23:03.180 --> 23:05.220
Everyone has their own
special talent,

23:05.220 --> 23:08.820
and Gwen found out that
hers was far more special

23:08.820 --> 23:12.420
than she could've
ever hoped for...

23:12.420 --> 23:13.620
yet.

23:13.620 --> 23:14.180
Cool.

23:14.180 --> 23:15.900
Cool.
That was really great.

23:15.900 --> 23:16.820
I have a special talent.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.340
I don't think I wanna know.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.740
Will this be disgusting?

23:22.740 --> 23:23.820
(howling)

23:30.060 --> 23:34.420
(wolves howling back)

23:36.020 --> 23:37.340
Uh, gotta go.

23:37.340 --> 23:39.660
Me, too.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.420
Hey, yo, wait up.
