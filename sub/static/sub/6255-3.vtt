Whew!
Oh, ho, ho, little lady!

00:16.125 --> 00:20.261
Whew, you're as pretty
as they come.

00:22.465 --> 00:24.799
Uh-uh, no way,
no way, not again!

00:24.834 --> 00:27.135
Hey, hold your horses,
there, partner.

00:27.169 --> 00:28.503
You know
the old saying:

00:28.537 --> 00:30.538
"Finders keepers,
losers go home."

00:30.573 --> 00:31.873
I have to tow
this car.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.742
I was sent here
by my dispatcher.

00:33.776 --> 00:35.610
Hey, I'm just trying
to do some good.

00:35.644 --> 00:38.213
The fact the city gives me
$100 per to get these wrecks

00:38.247 --> 00:39.814
off the street?

00:39.849 --> 00:40.815
That's just coincidence.

00:40.850 --> 00:42.016
Come on, bro.

00:42.051 --> 00:44.085
I have a family.
My... my little girl

00:44.120 --> 00:45.320
needs braces.

00:45.354 --> 00:46.688
Last time I heard
that story,

00:46.722 --> 00:48.189
it was about your dying mother.
Her, too.

00:48.224 --> 00:49.524
The mold from
the flood

00:49.558 --> 00:51.059
has spread to her
dialysis machine.

00:51.093 --> 00:54.496
Gotta make sure
the emergency brake's off.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.532
You've taken
four towing jobs

00:57.566 --> 00:59.100
from me
this month.

00:59.135 --> 01:00.802
You're going to put me
out of business.

01:03.139 --> 01:04.938
All right. You got me.
You can have the car.

01:04.974 --> 01:06.307
Really?
Yeah.

01:06.342 --> 01:08.042
No need to make
a big deal about it.

01:08.077 --> 01:10.044
I'm, uh, just being a good guy.

01:16.485 --> 01:17.852
Bastard!

01:23.859 --> 01:25.794
See you. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:30.432 --> 01:31.800
Hey, Sweets!

01:31.834 --> 01:33.034
Geez, Booth!

01:33.068 --> 01:34.335
Hey!

01:34.370 --> 01:35.303
You scared me.

01:35.337 --> 01:36.604
I work with
the FBI.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.173
I'm used to sneaking up
on people.

01:38.207 --> 01:39.674
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?

01:39.708 --> 01:41.075
What, I haven't seen you
in a few weeks,

01:41.110 --> 01:42.443
and that's the greeting I get?

01:42.478 --> 01:44.179
Of course.
It's good to see you, man.

01:44.213 --> 01:45.780
That's okay.
I wasn't fishing for a hug.

01:45.815 --> 01:48.049
Right. What, you just came
to check up on me, or...?

01:48.083 --> 01:49.551
Well, you haven't checked in,
you haven't called.

01:49.585 --> 01:51.853
Yeah, I-I-I've been
really busy.

01:51.887 --> 01:54.022
I guess time got away
from me, you know?

01:54.056 --> 01:56.090
Look, Sweets, I know
you feel responsible

01:56.125 --> 01:57.826
for those two guys
that Pelant killed.

01:57.860 --> 01:58.827
Wow.

01:58.861 --> 01:59.961
Who's the shrink now?

01:59.995 --> 02:01.262
It wasn't your fault.

02:01.297 --> 02:04.165
This isn't about
Pelant, okay?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.333
I like helping
these kids.

02:05.367 --> 02:07.035
I'm making a difference.

02:07.069 --> 02:08.735
You really like it here?

02:08.770 --> 02:11.038
Yeah. I really do.
I like it here.

02:11.073 --> 02:13.842
And I'm sorry I...
haven't kept in touch.

02:13.876 --> 02:15.743
I guess I just thought you
wouldn't understand, you know?

02:15.778 --> 02:17.946
I understand.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.113
Just do me a favor, okay?

02:19.148 --> 02:20.448
I'll take care
of myself.

02:20.482 --> 02:22.083
Not that.
But that's great.

02:22.117 --> 02:23.718
Uh, but, you know,
if I have a case,

02:23.752 --> 02:26.054
and-and you're on leave,
can I still call you for help?

02:26.088 --> 02:27.856
Yeah, if you think
it's something

02:27.890 --> 02:30.225
that only I can help
you with, of course.

02:31.126 --> 02:32.694
Great.

02:33.629 --> 02:35.530
It was good to see you, Booth.

02:36.832 --> 02:38.633
Good to see you, too, Sweets.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.134
Take care, all right?

02:46.709 --> 02:49.277
Maybe Sweets really
doesn't want to work

02:49.311 --> 02:50.511
at the FBI anymore.

02:50.546 --> 02:51.779
He's a profiler.

02:51.814 --> 02:53.147
It's what he does.

02:53.182 --> 02:56.618
Studies show,
due to extended life spans,

02:56.652 --> 03:00.054
the American male is most likely
to make a career change

03:00.089 --> 03:02.056
in his mid-
to late 20s.

03:02.091 --> 03:04.859
Supraorbital ridge
indicates the victim

03:04.894 --> 03:06.327
was male.

03:06.362 --> 03:08.162
He's just taking
his vacation time.

03:08.197 --> 03:09.831
- Sounds healthy to me.
- Are you saying

03:09.865 --> 03:11.232
we're not healthy
because we work all the time?

03:11.267 --> 03:13.868
Yes, that is exactly
what I'm saying.

03:13.903 --> 03:16.571
And there's no tissue
for me here.

03:16.605 --> 03:18.106
No DNA after a cookout
like this.

03:18.140 --> 03:19.807
We ran the plates.

03:19.842 --> 03:21.075
They're stolen,
from out of state.

03:21.110 --> 03:22.610
Then you should call
Agent Booth.

03:22.645 --> 03:23.878
This is his jurisdiction now.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.580
Thank God.

03:25.614 --> 03:28.983
Prominent malar
and intermediate nasal spine

03:29.018 --> 03:31.552
collectively suggest
Hispanic descent.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.688
Any way you can get the VIN
so we can trace the car?

03:33.722 --> 03:35.123
Yeah, sure.

03:38.227 --> 03:39.294
Oh, seriously?

03:39.328 --> 03:41.796
I hate messing up
evidence.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.331
That's okay, Dr. Hodgins.

03:43.365 --> 03:45.667
You couldn't have known
how fragile the car was.

03:45.701 --> 03:48.002
I think he could have.
 Thank you,

03:48.037 --> 03:49.277
Dr. B., because
I wasn't feeling

03:49.305 --> 03:50.838
bad enough as it is.

03:50.873 --> 03:52.740
We should probably just take
the car back to the lab.

03:52.775 --> 03:54.275
The whole thing?
Well, I'm not compromising

03:54.310 --> 03:55.710
any more evidence.

03:55.744 --> 03:57.946
And that's the only way
to retrieve the bones.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.182
The seat and the metal
have melted around them.

04:01.216 --> 04:02.984
What is that?

04:03.018 --> 04:04.452
It looks like a cleaver.

04:04.486 --> 04:06.521
It could be the
murder weapon.

04:12.161 --> 04:13.628
Careful.

04:15.698 --> 04:16.930
Oh!

04:16.966 --> 04:19.500
I couldn't have foreseen that.

04:19.535 --> 04:20.668
Yeah, you could've.

04:23.105 --> 04:24.305
Good, good,
good, good.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.007
I got it.
I got it.

04:30.079 --> 04:31.813
Whoa!
Whoa.

04:31.847 --> 04:34.415
But that was a surprise.

An open fracture
to the right parietal bone

05:12.258 --> 05:14.259
just above the
squamosal suture.

05:14.293 --> 05:15.460
It appears to be

05:15.494 --> 05:17.262
sharp-force
trauma.

05:17.296 --> 05:18.863
Okay, that thing looks pretty sharp:
Of course.

05:18.897 --> 05:20.698
It's a meat axe.
Butchers use it to...

05:20.733 --> 05:21.833
To chop up cows.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.034
Yeah, I get it.

05:23.068 --> 05:24.235
So far, there's
no evidence

05:24.270 --> 05:26.037
that this was used
on the victim.

05:26.071 --> 05:28.473
Well, what about that gash
to the head?

05:28.507 --> 05:30.441
The cause was more likely
a bullet wound.

05:30.476 --> 05:31.743
But the shape suggests...

05:31.777 --> 05:33.311
The shape suggests
that intense heat

05:33.345 --> 05:35.613
distorted what was once
a much smaller hole.

05:35.648 --> 05:36.714
You're right.

05:36.749 --> 05:38.283
Why is that surprising?

05:41.287 --> 05:44.656
Dr. Hodgins!

05:44.690 --> 05:46.391
Oh.

05:46.425 --> 05:47.759
Hey.

05:47.793 --> 05:49.127
All I asked for

05:49.161 --> 05:50.828
was the VIN number
of the vehicle.

05:50.863 --> 05:52.797
Yeah, and next, I'm sure
you're gonna want the bones,

05:52.831 --> 05:54.666
the particulates
and the trace that's in the car.

05:54.700 --> 05:55.900
Trust me, removing

05:55.934 --> 05:57.168
the roof
is the only way

05:57.202 --> 05:58.536
to get into
this heap

05:58.570 --> 05:59.837
without compromising evidence.

05:59.872 --> 06:01.506
Unless, of course,
you have a better method,

06:01.540 --> 06:03.508
in which case,
you know, I'm all ears.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.710
Well...

06:07.112 --> 06:09.714
You should tell me...

06:12.518 --> 06:14.452
...before you do
something like this.

06:14.486 --> 06:16.788
Okay. Just didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

06:16.822 --> 06:18.256
Whoa!

06:18.290 --> 06:19.691
Nobody move!

06:25.631 --> 06:26.898
Hey.

06:26.932 --> 06:28.099
That's a bullet.

06:28.133 --> 06:31.502
It was jammed
in the roof support.

06:31.537 --> 06:34.372
I'll get that
to ballistics.

06:34.406 --> 06:36.341
And get me that VIN number.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.742
Booth's chomping at the bit.

06:39.611 --> 06:40.845
Wow.

06:40.879 --> 06:42.847
That looks pretty
messy in there.

06:42.881 --> 06:44.215
Should I get my
restoration kit?

06:44.249 --> 06:46.117
Nah, no need.
The VIN's right here.

06:46.151 --> 06:47.819
Take me two seconds
to do a rubbing.

06:54.159 --> 06:55.360
I'll get my restoration kit.

06:56.528 --> 06:58.262
<i>Look...</i>

06:58.297 --> 07:00.031
I'm a regional sales manager.

07:00.065 --> 07:01.432
We don't kill people.

07:01.467 --> 07:03.434
Right, but the VIN number
says it was your car,

07:03.469 --> 07:04.936
Mr. Middlebury, and there
was a dead body in it.

07:04.970 --> 07:06.504
I already told you,
I-I don't know

07:06.538 --> 07:08.339
how my car got to
that part of town. Right.

07:08.374 --> 07:09.974
Where were you last night?
Home. Sleeping.

07:10.008 --> 07:12.443
Okay, so if you were home
sleeping last night

07:12.478 --> 07:13.711
while your car was stolen,

07:13.746 --> 07:15.113
how do you explain
this photograph?

07:15.147 --> 07:17.281
Security footage
of you

07:17.316 --> 07:18.649
taking money out
at an ATM

07:18.684 --> 07:20.251
six miles from your apartment,

07:20.285 --> 07:22.120
two blocks from where
your car was found.

07:22.154 --> 07:23.287
And... you see that
right there?

07:23.322 --> 07:24.422
That's a time stamp.

07:24.456 --> 07:25.823
I-I can explain.

07:25.858 --> 07:26.891
Good. I hope you can.

07:26.925 --> 07:28.292
Look, I have

07:28.327 --> 07:29.761
a perfectly good reason
to be at that ATM

07:29.795 --> 07:30.862
that doesn't involve murder.

07:30.896 --> 07:32.764
I just... needed money.

07:32.798 --> 07:34.766
That's all.
Great. Okay.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.567
Find yourself a lawyer, 'cause
I'm gonna book you for murder.

07:36.602 --> 07:38.503
What? No, no, wait.
Okay, I...

07:38.537 --> 07:40.071
I-I met this girl at
the sales conference.

07:40.105 --> 07:42.273
She was amazing.

07:42.307 --> 07:43.241
I don't care.

07:43.275 --> 07:44.909
R-Right.

07:44.943 --> 07:46.444
Everything was going
really well,

07:46.478 --> 07:50.415
and then she asked if I
could get us some coke.

07:50.449 --> 07:53.050
So your alibi is that
you were buying drugs?

07:53.085 --> 07:56.421
Yes. I mean, that's better
than murder, isn't it?

07:56.455 --> 07:58.656
I heard that there were some
dealers in that part of town.

07:58.690 --> 07:59.924
I left the conference.

07:59.958 --> 08:01.058
I stopped at that ATM.

08:01.093 --> 08:02.560
But when I came out,
my car was gone.

08:02.594 --> 08:03.995
Or the dealer ripped you off,
you shot him,

08:04.029 --> 08:05.129
you panicked, you burned him,

08:05.164 --> 08:06.998
and you left him in your car.
No!

08:07.032 --> 08:08.299
You do own a gun, right?

08:08.333 --> 08:09.567
That's legal! I...

08:09.601 --> 08:10.802
This whole thing
is a nightmare.

08:10.836 --> 08:12.170
She didn't even
wait for me.

08:12.204 --> 08:14.105
You don't have an alibi
at all, do you?

08:16.175 --> 08:17.341
No.

08:17.376 --> 08:19.377
Thank you.

08:29.154 --> 08:30.288
Where's Dr. Hodgins?

08:30.322 --> 08:31.622
Hey.

08:31.657 --> 08:33.124
You're gonna
tell me

08:33.158 --> 08:34.625
there's no other way
to remove evidence

08:34.659 --> 08:36.260
from the car?
Hey, don't knock it.

08:36.294 --> 08:38.162
Peter Pan here has
retrieved the pelvis,

08:38.197 --> 08:40.097
part of the left femur,
right tibia,

08:40.131 --> 08:41.399
medial cuneiform,

08:41.433 --> 08:43.201
proximal phalanges...

08:43.235 --> 08:44.869
Believe me,
this is not fun, okay?

08:44.903 --> 08:46.303
This harness
is smooshing the goods,

08:46.305 --> 08:47.872
so I'd like to get
this over with

08:47.906 --> 08:49.307
as soon as possible.

08:50.409 --> 08:51.576
Patella.

08:51.610 --> 08:52.910
Look at this.

08:52.945 --> 08:54.512
What?

08:54.546 --> 08:56.214
It's been broken.

08:56.248 --> 08:59.217
The perimortem damage could be
from a club or a crowbar.

08:59.251 --> 09:01.018
Maybe he owed someone money?

09:01.053 --> 09:02.487
Or drugs.

09:02.521 --> 09:04.755
<i>Could you get an I.D.</i>

09:04.790 --> 09:06.691
from the skull,
or was it too badly charred?

09:06.725 --> 09:09.026
Well, it burned evenly,
so I factored in heat

09:09.061 --> 09:11.128
and the length of time
it burned, and I was able

09:11.163 --> 09:13.030
to adjust for
the shrinkage.

09:13.065 --> 09:15.399
Booth thinks it could be
a drug deal gone bad.

09:15.434 --> 09:16.634
Yeah. Very bad.

09:16.668 --> 09:17.969
I'm gonna
have to check

09:18.003 --> 09:19.871
various databases,
so I'll call you

09:19.905 --> 09:21.272
when I find something.

09:21.306 --> 09:22.974
Okay.

09:23.008 --> 09:25.109
Oh.

09:25.944 --> 09:27.278
That was fast.

09:27.312 --> 09:28.779
You got a hit already?

09:28.814 --> 09:30.615
Yeah. Three.
DC Police,

09:30.649 --> 09:32.884
FBI and
the DC Parole Board.

09:32.918 --> 09:34.218
Jaime Delcampo.

09:34.253 --> 09:35.419
Seems he was a very

09:35.454 --> 09:37.788
high-level, prolific
hit man for a gang

09:37.823 --> 09:39.590
called the Estrellas Locos.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.125
"The Crazy Stars."

09:41.159 --> 09:42.927
Delcampo's street name

09:42.961 --> 09:44.161
was <i>El Carnicero.</i>

09:44.196 --> 09:45.496
The Butcher.

09:45.531 --> 09:47.732
That would explain the meat axe.

09:47.766 --> 09:50.201
Yeah, and why someone
would want him dead.

09:55.574 --> 09:57.642
Hey, man.
What's up?

09:58.510 --> 09:59.911
Hey, Sweets!

09:59.945 --> 10:02.146
Geez!
Could you let me know

10:02.180 --> 10:04.782
next time you're coming?
Right. Listen. Uh, I need your help.

10:04.816 --> 10:06.551
I said I would help you
only if you really nd me.

10:06.585 --> 10:07.885
I really need
your help.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.554
I said that to you
just this morning,

10:09.588 --> 10:11.722
and now you need me?
Come on, I don't think so.

10:11.757 --> 10:14.058
Look, I got a dead
Estrellas Locos on my hands,

10:14.092 --> 10:16.561
and I'm afraid I might be
having more come my way.

10:16.595 --> 10:19.263
Estrellas Locos?

10:19.298 --> 10:20.898
God...
Yeah.

10:20.933 --> 10:22.300
You know, you got a
current working knowledge

10:22.334 --> 10:23.568
of the community.

10:23.602 --> 10:24.902
Look, and the Estrellas Locos,

10:24.937 --> 10:26.270
they run through this neighborhood.
Right.

10:26.305 --> 10:27.638
But the people
I work with, Booth,

10:27.673 --> 10:29.073
they don't know
I'm law enforcement.

10:29.107 --> 10:30.942
They don't trust cops.
I mean, look around.

10:30.976 --> 10:32.376
They're just beginning
to accept me.

10:32.377 --> 10:33.777
I don't want
to lose that, you know?

10:33.779 --> 10:35.379
Well, let's just show
them that, you know,

10:35.414 --> 10:37.248
when bad things happen,
you know what,

10:37.282 --> 10:38.416
we're the good guys.

10:40.385 --> 10:41.719
Come on.

10:41.753 --> 10:44.055
All right.

10:44.089 --> 10:45.489
Hey.

10:45.524 --> 10:47.458
I'm just gonna help you
on this one case.

10:47.492 --> 10:49.160
And down here,
I call the shots. Okay?

10:49.194 --> 10:50.895
That's not a good word
to use around here.

10:50.929 --> 10:52.396
"Shots."
Right. Sorry.

10:52.431 --> 10:53.864
That's probably...
Let's start there, okay?

10:53.899 --> 10:55.433
Gun... shot, yeah.
Yeah.

10:57.604 --> 10:59.705
Jaime Delcampos' M.O.
is to cut off the head,

10:59.740 --> 11:02.262
the hands and the feet
of the victim

11:02.263 --> 11:03.530
and scatter them
around town.

11:03.565 --> 11:05.766
That's smart,
but mostly horrible.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.869
How do they know all that if
the bodies haven't been found?

11:08.903 --> 11:10.270
Metro PD has an informant
in the gang,

11:10.305 --> 11:11.872
but they're not gonna
give him up.

11:11.906 --> 11:14.074
Cops won't share intelligence
on a murder case?

11:14.108 --> 11:16.410
They can't. You know,
it takes months, sometimes years

11:16.444 --> 11:18.412
just to develop a source
inside the gang.

11:18.446 --> 11:20.581
Tell you what, they're not
just gonna give it up

11:20.615 --> 11:22.216
because of one
dead gangbanger.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.917
Don't be mixing
the gangs, <i>cher.</i>

11:23.952 --> 11:26.820
Estrellas here,
520 Mafia over there.

11:26.855 --> 11:28.055
Dr. Sweets!

11:28.089 --> 11:29.389
It is good to see you back.

11:29.424 --> 11:31.625
The FBI is always
a brighter place

11:31.659 --> 11:33.193
with you in it.
Well, thank you.

11:33.228 --> 11:34.962
I appreciate it.
I'm not actually back yet.

11:34.996 --> 11:37.130
I'm just here to help
Booth out with a case.

11:37.165 --> 11:39.066
Then I didn't mean what I said.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.501
I figured. So what's the deal
with all these boxes?

11:41.536 --> 11:43.537
I mean, it seems like
a lot for one murder.

11:43.571 --> 11:45.372
This is a RICO case, <i>cher.</i>

11:45.406 --> 11:48.408
We're looking at a highly
organized criminal enterprise.

11:48.443 --> 11:50.377
Estrellas Locos will kill
to protect their turf.

11:50.411 --> 11:52.446
Right now they're in war
with four other gangs.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.680
What gangs?

11:53.715 --> 11:55.349
We got the
Gold Brick Crew, right?

11:55.383 --> 11:58.051
Hobart Park Kings,
Wa Ching Council

11:58.086 --> 11:59.553
and the 520 Mafia.

11:59.587 --> 12:01.088
Does Delcampo have
any family

12:01.122 --> 12:03.156
aside from, you know,
the gang?

12:03.191 --> 12:05.826
A live-in girlfriend.
I'd like to speak to her.

12:05.860 --> 12:07.227
No, that's a waste of time.
She's also Estrellas Locos.

12:07.262 --> 12:08.562
She's not gonna
tell us anything.

12:08.596 --> 12:10.063
We just have
to wait this out until,

12:10.098 --> 12:11.298
you know,
we get something solid.

12:11.332 --> 12:13.133
You wanted my help, right?

12:13.167 --> 12:14.835
I want to talk to her.

12:16.437 --> 12:18.205
Sweets grew himself
some cojones.

12:18.239 --> 12:19.473
Yes, he did.

12:31.352 --> 12:32.686
No tags from rival gangs.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.321
This whole neighborhood
is Estrellas Locos.

12:34.355 --> 12:36.490
They're not gonna be happy
to see us down here.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.462
This place is a hotbed
for illegal activity.

12:42.497 --> 12:44.564
Years of harassment,
lack of employment,

12:44.599 --> 12:46.833
no decent education--
can you blame them?

12:46.868 --> 12:49.670
When they start shooting
people, I can blame them.

12:51.172 --> 12:53.407
<i>Ya basta!</i>
<i>Ahí voy.</i>

12:53.441 --> 12:54.741
Federales.

12:54.776 --> 12:56.343
<i>Necesitamos hablar</i>
<i>con usted, por favor.</i>

12:56.377 --> 12:57.544
You speak Spanish, huh?

12:57.578 --> 12:58.712
Yeah, I've been learning.

12:58.746 --> 12:59.947
You know,
it helps at work.

12:59.981 --> 13:01.715
Just be careful.
I know.

13:01.749 --> 13:03.650
<i>Hola.</i>

13:03.685 --> 13:05.018
<i>¿Es usted Maria Alvarado?</i>

13:05.053 --> 13:06.386
Your Spanish sucks.

13:06.421 --> 13:07.688
I know. Yeah.

13:07.722 --> 13:09.156
FBI, Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

13:09.190 --> 13:10.590
This here is my associate,
Dr. Sweets.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.125
Good for you.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.861
We're here to ask you
about Jaime Delcampo.

13:17.198 --> 13:18.932
I don't know who that is.

13:18.967 --> 13:21.201
Well, your parole officer said
that he lived here with you.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.103
His body was found
late last night.

13:24.372 --> 13:26.673
Thanks for letting me know.
Uh, excuse me.

13:26.708 --> 13:29.142
You know, we could go downtown
and do this if you want.

13:29.177 --> 13:30.777
We're not gonna take you
anywhere.

13:30.812 --> 13:32.579
Sweets...

13:32.613 --> 13:35.716
Look, we just want
to make sure that you're okay.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.651
All right, sometimes with
a killing like this,

13:37.685 --> 13:38.785
when rival gangs are involved,

13:38.820 --> 13:40.787
it spills over
onto innocent people.

13:40.822 --> 13:42.522
If we knew who he might have had
a disagreement with...

13:42.557 --> 13:43.623
Disagreement?
Yeah.

13:43.658 --> 13:44.858
You know where you are, right?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.760
We got your back, Maria.

13:46.794 --> 13:48.762
Those bruises on your face
look recent.

13:48.796 --> 13:50.464
You were in a fight?

13:50.498 --> 13:52.432
I fell.

13:52.467 --> 13:55.202
You know, I do some work
at Adams Community Center.

13:55.236 --> 13:56.903
They could help you.
Good for them.

13:56.938 --> 13:58.605
They're harassing me.
You see it? I done nothing.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.140
No, no one is harassing anyone.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.943
Everyone just relax, okay?
Calm down.

14:02.977 --> 14:06.013
Who's in there?
None of your business. Get lost.

14:06.047 --> 14:08.315
<i>Déjenme en paz!</i>
<i>Váyanse de mi casa!</i>

14:08.349 --> 14:10.517
<i>Yo no sé nada, no he hecho</i>
<i>nada!Solo vienen a molestar.</i>

14:10.551 --> 14:12.019
All right,
everybody just relax.

14:12.053 --> 14:13.420
Calm down and go back
inside your homes.

14:13.454 --> 14:15.055
We're sorry
to have disturbed you.

14:15.089 --> 14:16.456
We're just trying to keep
this neighborhood safe.

14:16.491 --> 14:18.291
We do that ourselves.

14:18.326 --> 14:20.427
Let's go. Come on.

14:22.430 --> 14:24.264
You gonna shoot
a little boy now?!

14:24.298 --> 14:26.867
No, no, no, it's okay.
Is that how you keep us safe?

14:26.901 --> 14:28.502
You see what he did?
Everybody stay calm.

14:28.536 --> 14:30.103
Okay, we're gonna do this
my way now, okay, Sweets?

14:30.138 --> 14:33.073
It's a big misunderstanding.
Sorry, son, all right?

14:33.107 --> 14:34.608
No one's gonna
get hurt, okay?

14:34.642 --> 14:37.210
Sorry about
the misunderstanding.

14:37.245 --> 14:39.513
Just walk slowly,
watch my back

14:39.547 --> 14:41.148
and just walk back
to the car calmly.

14:41.182 --> 14:42.816
I've seen that boy
at the Community Center.

14:42.850 --> 14:44.084
He's a smart kid.

14:44.118 --> 14:45.819
He helps the others
with their homework.

14:45.853 --> 14:48.655
All right, let's just save
story time till later, okay?

14:54.896 --> 14:56.263
These are all out of order.

14:56.297 --> 14:57.764
I'm gonna have to
put everything back

14:57.799 --> 14:59.199
in the car
and start over.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.101
Yeah, that's not even
kind of funny, okay?

15:01.135 --> 15:02.469
I'd like to have
more kids.

15:02.503 --> 15:03.670
C-1 vertebra.

15:03.704 --> 15:05.072
A couple metatarsals...

15:05.106 --> 15:07.474
This is metal;
it's not my domain.

15:07.508 --> 15:09.176
It's probably part of the car.

15:11.579 --> 15:13.447
It's the post
from an earring.

15:13.481 --> 15:15.682
It could have been
the victim's.

15:15.716 --> 15:18.051
Like tattoos, jewelry
and other adornments

15:18.086 --> 15:22.422
on a gang member's body
denote rank and accomplishment.

15:22.457 --> 15:24.891
Hodgins, we're still missing
part of his scapula, the talus,

15:24.926 --> 15:26.660
the lumbar vertebrae,
left acromion...

15:26.694 --> 15:29.296
Yeah, I'm working
as fast as I can.

15:29.330 --> 15:30.864
We don't have
much time, man.

15:30.898 --> 15:32.999
Booth said that the tension
in the neighborhood is high.

15:33.034 --> 15:34.301
Anthropologically,
neighborhood gangs are

15:34.335 --> 15:36.336
just another
warrior culture.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.505
When threatened, they respond
as any nation-state would.

15:38.539 --> 15:41.675
Even their graffiti is similar
to what one would find

15:41.709 --> 15:43.210
in an early
Etruscan settlement.

15:43.244 --> 15:46.346
Except the Etruscans
didn't have assault rifles.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.115
Seems to be an indentation

15:48.149 --> 15:50.617
on the anterior surface
of the C-1.

15:50.651 --> 15:52.352
Could it be a heat fracture?
No.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.221
That is a crease.

15:54.255 --> 15:56.890
Something struck the vertebra.
It might have been the axe.

15:56.924 --> 15:59.693
I found the earrings.

16:08.102 --> 16:09.870
ria varado would
rather put herself in danger

16:09.904 --> 16:11.304
than help the police.

16:11.339 --> 16:13.306
If she bypasses the gang
and cooperates with us,

16:13.341 --> 16:14.674
she'd be the
next victim.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.243
Maybe she got those bruises
from Delcampo.

16:16.277 --> 16:17.978
Maybe she's the one
who killed him.

16:18.012 --> 16:19.746
No, men call the
shots in a gang.

16:19.780 --> 16:21.314
Women tend to
facilitate the murders;

16:21.349 --> 16:23.183
they procure weapons,
they lure prey.

16:23.217 --> 16:24.417
There are five additional,

16:24.452 --> 16:26.019
unsolved murders
that we know of

16:26.053 --> 16:27.854
tied to the gun that killed
Jaime Delcampo.

16:27.889 --> 16:29.789
I didn't think you
had a murder weapon.

16:29.824 --> 16:32.959
The ballistics report
just came in for the bullet

16:32.994 --> 16:34.394
Hodgins recovered from the car.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.696
It was fired from the same
Rossi snub-nose .38

16:36.731 --> 16:38.532
used in these
other gang hits.

16:38.566 --> 16:41.368
My guess is it's definitely a library gun.
Library gun?

16:41.402 --> 16:43.737
Yeah, a gang keeps an arsenal
of unregistered guns

16:43.771 --> 16:45.372
and loans them to gang members.

16:45.406 --> 16:47.073
It's a defense
attorney's dream.

16:47.108 --> 16:48.642
The more killings
on each gun,

16:48.676 --> 16:50.010
the more muddled
the evidence chain.

16:50.044 --> 16:52.145
Tell you what-- we
find that library gun,

16:52.180 --> 16:53.747
we do some serious
damage to that gang.

16:53.781 --> 16:55.715
Now, of all of these,
the only gang

16:55.750 --> 16:58.351
that was not shot by that gun
was the 520 Mafia.

16:58.386 --> 17:01.521
The war chief of the 520s
is Curtis Martin.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.723
Maybe you can ask him
for a library card.

17:05.593 --> 17:07.327
<i>I checked the C-1.</i>

17:07.361 --> 17:08.561
The indentations that you found

17:08.596 --> 17:10.829
were not caused
by the fire or the axe.

17:10.865 --> 17:12.031
But look at this.

17:12.066 --> 17:13.200
The staining on the fracturing.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.035
Why would it show up
on an X-ray?

17:15.069 --> 17:17.503
It's lead. That's the only
substance that appears

17:17.538 --> 17:19.071
like this on an X-ray.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.007
This crease was caused
by a bullet.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.578
I originally attributed this
nick on the anterior aspect

17:24.612 --> 17:26.980
of the foramen magnum
to heat fracturing.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.481
But look.

17:28.516 --> 17:30.417
When the skull
and the cervical vertebrae

17:30.451 --> 17:32.018
are properly aligned,
it appears to be

17:32.053 --> 17:33.954
the trajectory
of a second bullet.

17:33.988 --> 17:35.822
He was shot twice:
once in the throat,

17:35.856 --> 17:37.557
once in the side of the head.

17:37.592 --> 17:40.994
Which means we have two
entry wounds with no exits.

17:41.028 --> 17:42.529
That's impossible.

17:48.302 --> 17:50.370
<i>They're involved in drugs,</i>

17:50.404 --> 17:53.039
murder for hire,
gun sales.

17:53.074 --> 17:55.976
I mean, 520 Mafia
is a full-service gang.

17:56.010 --> 17:57.644
You sure you're okay?

17:57.678 --> 17:59.279
You mean what happened back
with the Estrellas Locos?

17:59.313 --> 18:00.880
Yeah, I was nervous, but...
No, no, no, no.

18:00.915 --> 18:02.115
Not that, Sweets, all right?

18:02.149 --> 18:03.617
You know, the whole
Pelant incident.

18:03.651 --> 18:06.119
I know you don't want
to talk about it, but...

18:06.153 --> 18:07.921
Because there's not much
to talk about.

18:07.955 --> 18:10.523
Well, you ran away, Sweets.
No, I didn't.

18:10.558 --> 18:12.959
I went across town
for a while

18:12.994 --> 18:14.261
to do something else.
Right.

18:14.295 --> 18:15.996
You went across town
so you didn't have

18:16.030 --> 18:18.198
to deal with feeling responsible
for what Pelant did.

18:18.232 --> 18:20.467
I'm dealing with it.

18:20.501 --> 18:22.102
You know, in the Rangers,

18:22.136 --> 18:24.304
as a sniper, if you didn't
confront what you did,

18:24.338 --> 18:26.606
understand it, it would
follow you, you know, own you.

18:26.641 --> 18:29.676
Maybe you should
talk to someone.

18:29.710 --> 18:31.578
The guy who hates talking
to shrinks is telling me

18:31.612 --> 18:32.946
to talk to a shrink.
That's funny.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.314
Look, I am just
saying, all right,

18:34.348 --> 18:36.149
if this was the
other way around...

18:36.183 --> 18:38.084
I'd really like to just focus
on the case, all right?

18:38.119 --> 18:39.986
'Cause we're about to confront
a murdering drug dealer.

18:40.021 --> 18:42.656
It's probably best not to focus
on personal issues right now.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.292
Sure.

18:45.326 --> 18:46.993
Cool.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.901
Gang units think
the 520s are behind

18:54.935 --> 18:57.170
at least 18 murders
this year.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.205
Curtis Martin
is their warlord.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.041
Didn't think it was
gonna get this intense.

19:01.075 --> 19:02.842
You sure you're
still up for this?

19:02.877 --> 19:04.210
Yeah, I said I'd help.

19:04.245 --> 19:05.578
Right.

19:09.183 --> 19:11.151
I see you're a cop.
What are you?

19:11.185 --> 19:13.320
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.

19:13.354 --> 19:14.888
This here is my associate,
Dr. Sweets.

19:14.922 --> 19:16.156
We're here about Jaime Delcampo.

19:16.190 --> 19:17.390
Why, he kill someone?

19:17.425 --> 19:19.326
He was murdered last night.
Damn.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.695
I was wondering why
it was such a beautiful day.

19:21.729 --> 19:23.830
Based on your admitted antipathy
to Delcampo,

19:23.864 --> 19:25.498
you're our most likely suspect,
Mr. Martin.

19:25.533 --> 19:26.800
Mr. Martin?

19:26.834 --> 19:29.035
I like that.
I would have loved to see

19:29.070 --> 19:31.754
the life leave those eyes,
but it wasn't me.

19:31.906 --> 19:34.741
Where were you between the hours
of 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. last night?

19:34.775 --> 19:36.710
Giving my lady a ride, man.

19:38.946 --> 19:40.647
Get down!

19:55.029 --> 19:55.995
Drop the gun.

19:57.365 --> 19:59.265
Drop it!

19:59.300 --> 20:02.001
Let's go. Put your hands
on the door. Let's go.

20:02.036 --> 20:03.903
Turn around.
Spread the legs.

20:03.938 --> 20:05.438
Sweets, you okay?
Yeah.

20:05.473 --> 20:06.840
Cuff this guy.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.088
Estrellas Locos, two of them.

20:22.123 --> 20:23.757
This was retaliation
for Delcampo.

20:35.409 --> 20:36.503
<i>Well, the Estrellas think</i>

20:36.504 --> 20:38.371
that Curtis Martin
killed Delcampo, okay?

20:38.372 --> 20:40.339
The drive-by
was a payback.

20:40.374 --> 20:43.743
Booth, can you just put
the case aside for a minute?

20:43.777 --> 20:45.178
You were shot at.

20:45.212 --> 20:47.213
I get shot at my whole life.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.915
No, that's not why
I'm upset.

20:48.949 --> 20:51.451
I had to hear about it from Cam.

20:51.485 --> 20:53.619
Well, you know,
I had to bring him in,

20:53.654 --> 20:54.754
you know, file the report.

20:54.788 --> 20:56.022
There was a lot going on.

20:56.056 --> 20:58.124
A call. One call.

20:58.158 --> 20:59.792
One minute.

20:59.827 --> 21:02.195
Right. You know what,
you're absolutely right.

21:02.229 --> 21:04.230
I'm sorry. You should have
heard that from me.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.364
Okay, let's make a pact, okay?

21:05.399 --> 21:06.799
From now on,
whoever gets shot at

21:06.834 --> 21:08.401
has to tell the other one
right away.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.838
Okay. Unless one of us
is already dead.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.606
Right.

21:13.640 --> 21:18.544
I heard that Sweets knew the son
of the Estrella woman.

21:18.579 --> 21:20.580
Yeah. He thinks he's
a really good kid.

21:20.614 --> 21:22.882
The pressure to join a gang,

21:22.916 --> 21:25.485
especially if his mother
is a member,

21:25.519 --> 21:27.420
will be overwhelming.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.355
Well, Sweets think that,
with a little guidance,

21:29.389 --> 21:31.090
I mean, kids like him
can escape.

21:31.125 --> 21:33.526
That's like thinking
that a young Spartan male

21:33.560 --> 21:35.561
could have refused
to join the army.

21:35.596 --> 21:36.629
I'm sure they did.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.131
Yes, and those who did

21:38.165 --> 21:40.333
were killed
as an example of cardice.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.268
All right, look, let's just give
Sweets a break, okay?

21:42.302 --> 21:45.138
He's trying to make
a difference.

21:45.172 --> 21:47.273
Oh, okay, they processed Martin.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.176
They're waiting for me
to come in. Look...

21:50.210 --> 21:53.179
I'm sorry.

21:53.213 --> 21:55.314
That's good.

22:01.155 --> 22:03.289
Right.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.130
This is crap, man.
I saved your life.

22:11.165 --> 22:12.498
Yeah, that's one way
to spin it.

22:12.533 --> 22:13.766
Oh, yeah?

22:13.801 --> 22:14.934
Well, how else
you see it?

22:14.968 --> 22:17.270
From my seat,
you killed two men

22:17.304 --> 22:19.572
with an unlicensed
automatic weapon.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.942
A soldier like you with
an 18-page rap sheet?

22:22.976 --> 22:24.110
That's 15 to life

22:24.144 --> 22:25.578
before I even
prepare my case.

22:25.612 --> 22:26.913
We know the drive-by
was a payback

22:26.947 --> 22:28.848
because the 520s
killed Delcampo.

22:28.882 --> 22:30.383
No, you got it wrong.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.118
- We don't want any war, man.
- Right?

22:32.152 --> 22:34.921
Tell you what, you give us
the gun that was used,

22:34.955 --> 22:36.889
and maybe I'll have
this lovely lady here

22:36.924 --> 22:38.424
cut you a deal.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.992
Look, I told y'all
everything I know.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.427
Let's go, Booth.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.262
I'll buy you some pie.
Mmm...

22:43.297 --> 22:45.064
All right.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.799
Look, I heard
one of

22:46.834 --> 22:48.401
the Estrellas
was talking to the cops.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.903
Who was it?
Look, I don't know.

22:50.938 --> 22:52.505
You know, maybe that's
what got your boy killed.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.640
Maybe he was cooperating
and someone found out.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.845
Mr. Bray found
a second bullet wound

22:58.879 --> 23:00.146
that I can't explain.

23:00.180 --> 23:01.814
What's so confusing
about that?

23:01.849 --> 23:03.516
It suggests two
entrance wounds

23:03.550 --> 23:04.684
but no exits.

23:04.718 --> 23:06.352
Ballistics confirmed
that the bullet

23:06.386 --> 23:07.753
Hodgins found
in the car

23:07.788 --> 23:09.422
caused the wound
to the victim's skull,

23:09.456 --> 23:10.857
so it had to get
out of there somehow.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.959
I concur.
There has to be an explanation.

23:12.993 --> 23:15.795
So Delcampo was shot twice?

23:15.829 --> 23:17.530
Two entry
wounds, yes.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.664
But no exit wounds.

23:18.699 --> 23:20.266
But the bullet
Hodgins retrieved

23:20.300 --> 23:22.034
was definitely one of
the slugs that killed him.

23:22.069 --> 23:24.604
Yes, but we have no idea
how it left his body.

23:24.638 --> 23:27.206
Angela scanned
the bullet and the skull

23:27.241 --> 23:29.976
to try to re-create
what might have happened.

23:30.010 --> 23:31.510
Hey.

23:31.545 --> 23:33.813
So let me walk you through
what I have so far.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.848
Bullet number one
enters the head

23:35.883 --> 23:37.350
at the right
parietal.

23:40.821 --> 23:42.355
Which shows that the bullet

23:42.389 --> 23:43.990
should have remained
inside the skull.

23:44.024 --> 23:45.491
But we found no
bullet in the skull.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.692
What about the second bullet?

23:50.464 --> 23:53.266
That should have stayed
inside the skull, too.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.401
The damage to the foramen magnum
would have been more pronounced

23:55.435 --> 23:57.870
if it were a direct hit.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.241
Wait.

24:04.077 --> 24:06.679
Your animations are accurate,
but not the results.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.347
Fire bullet number two
again, but this time,

24:08.382 --> 24:11.951
stop it just before
it makes contact with the C-1.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.122
Now, when the bullet
strikes the C-1,

24:16.156 --> 24:17.623
send it into yaw.

24:17.658 --> 24:18.991
Would it do that?

24:19.026 --> 24:21.594
Yes.
Newton's First Law of Motion.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.396
A body in motion stays in motion

24:23.430 --> 24:25.197
unless acted upon
by an outside force.

24:25.232 --> 24:28.267
In this case, the C-1.

24:28.302 --> 24:29.869
Also, adjust for the resistance

24:29.903 --> 24:31.904
of the gelatinous
nature of the brain.

24:38.145 --> 24:39.612
The bullet made a hard left.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.014
There was only one shot,
one bullet.

24:42.049 --> 24:43.983
But isn't that an entry wound?

24:44.017 --> 24:45.484
No, it's not.

24:45.519 --> 24:47.420
The bullet exited
the skull laterally,

24:47.454 --> 24:51.223
which caused the beveling to bow
inward like an entry wound.

24:51.258 --> 24:52.558
So he was shot from the front.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.360
We thought this was
a gang execution,

24:54.394 --> 24:55.828
- but it wasn't.
- I agree.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.964
The shooter was in front
of Delcampo and below.

24:57.998 --> 24:59.932
On the ground?

24:59.967 --> 25:04.103
Seems like someone fought with
Delcampo before they shot him.

25:07.274 --> 25:10.142
We know Delcampo was the sixth
victim killed with that gun.

25:10.177 --> 25:12.144
But the timing
doesn't make any sense.

25:12.179 --> 25:14.080
There has to be commonality
between the victims.

25:14.114 --> 25:16.248
There is.
They were all gang members.

25:16.283 --> 25:17.683
Look, Delcampo was
the only Estrellas Locos

25:17.718 --> 25:18.951
that was
on the gun, right?

25:18.986 --> 25:20.186
What are you
thinking?

25:20.220 --> 25:22.154
Well, the tools
that Delcampo used

25:22.189 --> 25:24.156
to dispose of bodies
were in his car.

25:24.191 --> 25:27.626
What if he was on his way home
from a... a hit?

25:27.661 --> 25:29.829
Hodgins did find
remnants of cinder blocks

25:29.863 --> 25:31.597
to weigh
down a body.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.999
But if he used
the library gun,

25:33.033 --> 25:34.734
he would have
to return it to someone.

25:34.768 --> 25:36.969
And maybe that someone,
you know, shot him, killed him.

25:37.004 --> 25:38.971
That makes sense.
He wouldn't be expecting it.

25:39.006 --> 25:40.740
So the gun belongs
to the Estrellas Locos?

25:40.774 --> 25:41.907
He must have committed

25:41.942 --> 25:43.576
an offense
against the gang.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.344
They handle their
disputes internally.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.379
Martin was right.

25:46.413 --> 25:47.680
Someone saw the Butcher

25:47.714 --> 25:48.981
talk to
the cops.

25:49.016 --> 25:50.549
But why wasn't he killed
execution style?

25:50.584 --> 25:52.118
That's how the gang
sends a message

25:52.152 --> 25:53.652
to anyone else
thinking of talking.

25:53.687 --> 25:55.087
It doesn't
make any sense.

25:55.122 --> 25:56.489
Booth.

25:56.523 --> 25:57.590
Yeah.

25:57.624 --> 25:58.557
Right.

25:58.592 --> 26:00.726
A seventh victim was found.

26:00.761 --> 26:02.261
Shot with the same gun.

26:11.809 --> 26:14.644
Adrianna Garcia, Hispanic.

26:14.678 --> 26:16.779
22 years old, female.

26:16.814 --> 26:19.015
According to
the police report,

26:19.049 --> 26:21.851
she was discovered at the
base of a concrete pour.

26:21.885 --> 26:24.420
Coroner fixed
time of death at two days ago.

26:24.455 --> 26:25.822
Approximately
the same time

26:25.856 --> 26:27.223
that Delcampo
was killed.

26:27.257 --> 26:30.226
It was El Carnicero's
M.O. to leave

26:30.260 --> 26:32.161
his victims' body parts
in different places.

26:32.196 --> 26:34.697
Hey, those earrings
Hodgins found--

26:34.732 --> 26:36.499
looks like they
belonged to her.

26:36.533 --> 26:38.334
They were ripped
from her ears.

26:38.369 --> 26:40.036
Isn't it common
in warrior cultures

26:40.070 --> 26:42.505
for them to take a trophy
from their kill?

26:42.539 --> 26:44.040
It signifies
the spoils of war.

26:44.074 --> 26:45.775
Oh, that's
very romantic.

26:45.809 --> 26:47.644
But I'm thinking this guy
was just a lowlife

26:47.678 --> 26:50.079
who saw a chance to make
a few extra bucks.

26:50.114 --> 26:52.248
It is so much worse
when they have a face.

26:54.251 --> 26:55.852
Okay, I take that back.

26:55.886 --> 26:57.754
That is actually much worse.

26:57.788 --> 26:58.888
Laceration
and cavitation

26:58.922 --> 27:01.557
definitely point to a bullet

27:01.592 --> 27:02.859
piercing
the brain.

27:02.893 --> 27:04.373
Well, it entered
through the parietal.

27:04.395 --> 27:05.662
Textbook
gang hit,

27:05.696 --> 27:07.330
like the rest
of his victims.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.265
Well, except Delcampo.

27:09.299 --> 27:10.667
These kerf marks

27:10.701 --> 27:12.735
were made by a heavy blade.
And it took

27:12.770 --> 27:15.171
multiple strikes
to detach the head.

27:15.205 --> 27:17.874
Once the skull is defleshed,
we can compare

27:17.908 --> 27:20.443
his axe to these
injuries to determine

27:20.477 --> 27:21.611
if Delcampo did this.

27:21.645 --> 27:23.046
Well, it won't take long.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.381
The M.E. did most
of the heavy lifting.

27:56.513 --> 27:58.281
Wow.

28:06.190 --> 28:08.124
Perfect.

28:09.326 --> 28:12.762
Now let's look
at those hack marks.

28:12.796 --> 28:15.465
Adrianna Garcia
was brought in 12 times--

28:15.499 --> 28:16.933
shoplifting,

28:16.967 --> 28:18.267
drug trafficking,

28:18.302 --> 28:20.269
trafficking
in counterfeit merchandise,

28:20.304 --> 28:21.504
disorderly conduct.

28:21.538 --> 28:22.739
High achiever.

28:22.773 --> 28:24.293
Well, great.
PD finally got back to me.

28:24.308 --> 28:26.509
Adrianna Garcia,
she was the informant.

28:26.543 --> 28:28.177
Turns out she was also sleeping
with Delcampo.

28:28.212 --> 28:29.645
Well, that wouldn't matter
to Maria.

28:29.680 --> 28:30.646
Being faithful
isn't part of the deal.

28:30.681 --> 28:31.881
I agree.

28:31.915 --> 28:33.382
But she would care

28:33.417 --> 28:35.218
that an Estrellas
was talking to the cops.

28:35.252 --> 28:37.987
Booth.

28:38.021 --> 28:40.423
The victim's right zygomatic
was also fractured.

28:40.457 --> 28:42.425
It matches the
fracturing we found

28:42.459 --> 28:44.861
on Delcampo's
left patella.

28:44.895 --> 28:46.963
You understand
what that means?

28:46.997 --> 28:49.065
It means they struggled, and
Delcampo kneed her in the face,

28:49.099 --> 28:50.266
hard enough
to fracture his kneecap.

28:50.300 --> 28:51.567
That tracks.

28:51.602 --> 28:53.803
After Delcampo
kills Adrianna,

28:53.837 --> 28:55.471
he has to return
the gun to the library.

28:55.506 --> 28:56.639
To Maria.

28:56.673 --> 28:57.840
I think she did care

28:57.875 --> 28:59.308
that he cheated on her.

28:59.343 --> 29:02.044
It didn't look like a hit
because it wasn't.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.847
It was revenge.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.988
<i>So which was worse</i>
<i>for you, Maria?</i>

29:12.022 --> 29:14.390
Finding out that Adrianna
was an informant,

29:14.424 --> 29:16.192
or that she was sleeping
with your man?

29:16.226 --> 29:19.295
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:19.329 --> 29:20.563
Things worked out
pretty good for you.

29:20.597 --> 29:22.431
You were able to get rid
of both of them,

29:22.466 --> 29:23.699
so how'd it go down?

29:23.734 --> 29:25.668
You shouldn't bother me
like this.

29:25.702 --> 29:28.504
I'm grieving for a loved one.

29:30.007 --> 29:31.474
I know how
it happened.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.775
He came back
with the gun,

29:32.810 --> 29:33.876
you know it,

29:33.911 --> 29:35.311
so you taught
him a lesson.

29:35.345 --> 29:36.979
And you put it back
in the library.

29:37.014 --> 29:38.214
If you could prove
any of that,

29:38.248 --> 29:39.382
you wouldn't be
asking me questions.

29:39.416 --> 29:40.850
We're gonna
find the gun.

29:40.884 --> 29:42.618
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:42.653 --> 29:44.787
You know, the longer this goes
on, the worse it is for you.

29:44.822 --> 29:48.224
You think I ain't wasted time
talking toto the cops before?

29:48.258 --> 29:49.692
I got my shows recording.

29:49.726 --> 29:52.228
I ain't missing nothing
being here.

29:58.135 --> 30:00.136
This is gonna be a long night.

30:00.170 --> 30:01.504
We couldn't find
any hard evidence

30:01.538 --> 30:03.072
that links Maria to the crime.

30:03.106 --> 30:04.607
So it's up to Booth.

30:04.641 --> 30:06.375
This is not Maria's
first time at the prom.

30:06.410 --> 30:07.977
She's going to try
and outlast him.

30:08.011 --> 30:09.345
Booth must have expected that.

30:09.379 --> 30:10.980
He knows that
she can't outlast him.

30:11.014 --> 30:12.215
I'm going to get

30:12.249 --> 30:13.482
the crime scene
photos of Delcampo.

30:13.517 --> 30:14.951
That's a good idea.

30:14.985 --> 30:16.686
See how it affects her.
Put her on her heels.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.687
Sweets?

30:17.721 --> 30:19.055
It means
a lot to Booth

30:19.089 --> 30:20.790
that you came
back to help.

30:20.824 --> 30:22.091
What are friends for, right?

30:22.125 --> 30:24.227
You know,
no one blames you

30:24.261 --> 30:25.561
for what happened
with Pelant.

30:25.596 --> 30:27.096
I know.

30:27.130 --> 30:28.764
But you blame yourself.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.134
I'm gonna get the photos.

30:39.176 --> 30:41.644
Oh... come on.

30:45.682 --> 30:47.717
Hey.

30:49.286 --> 30:51.187
So, your mom might
be here a while.

30:51.221 --> 30:52.922
Someone from
Child Services

30:52.956 --> 30:55.758
is going to make sure
you're taken care of.

30:55.792 --> 30:57.059
I know how it goes.

30:57.094 --> 30:58.494
I've been through this before.

30:58.528 --> 31:00.496
Sure.

31:00.530 --> 31:02.298
Can I get you something
while you wait?

31:02.332 --> 31:04.934
Um... soda,
chips, sandwich?

31:04.968 --> 31:06.168
No.

31:07.738 --> 31:09.205
Something to eat, I guess.

31:09.239 --> 31:10.473
I don't care what.

31:10.507 --> 31:12.541
What is that?
You doing homework?

31:12.576 --> 31:15.044
No, it's an astronomy book.

31:15.078 --> 31:16.345
You like astronomy?

31:16.380 --> 31:17.880
Yeah.

31:17.915 --> 31:21.417
Every time they look,
the universe gets bigger.

31:21.451 --> 31:24.487
You know, we have,
uh, mentors

31:24.521 --> 31:25.755
at the Community Center

31:25.789 --> 31:27.757
for kids with
special interests.

31:27.791 --> 31:29.091
I could probably
even find an astronomer

31:29.126 --> 31:30.726
at the Jeffersonian
you could talk to.

31:30.761 --> 31:33.262
My mother said
I can't go back to the Center.

31:33.297 --> 31:35.064
Not after you came to the house.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.433
Oh.

31:37.467 --> 31:39.135
I shouldn't be talking to you.

31:39.169 --> 31:40.403
And I'm not hungry anymore.

31:40.437 --> 31:41.771
I don't need anything.

31:44.374 --> 31:46.876
<i>The boy knows something.</i>

31:46.910 --> 31:48.010
Yeah, that his mama

31:48.045 --> 31:49.412
and everybody
she knows is evil.

31:49.446 --> 31:51.747
He might know his mother
killed Delcampo.

31:51.782 --> 31:52.982
And if she's the librarian,

31:53.016 --> 31:54.717
he might know where
the gun is hidden.

31:54.751 --> 31:56.085
Sweets, he's not going to rat
his mother out.

31:56.119 --> 31:57.353
And, anthropologically,

31:57.387 --> 31:58.867
he's been conditioned
to hold the gang

31:58.889 --> 32:00.289
even above
his own family.

32:00.324 --> 32:01.891
He's not gonna talk
about any of this.

32:01.925 --> 32:03.225
With all due respect
to anthropology,

32:03.260 --> 32:04.860
he started
to open up to me.

32:04.895 --> 32:07.363
He wanted to talk, but then,
as soon as he felt vulnerable,

32:07.397 --> 32:08.965
he got scared and closed up.

32:08.999 --> 32:10.299
That's great
and everything, Sweets,

32:10.334 --> 32:11.734
but legally,
you can't talk to him.

32:11.768 --> 32:14.003
Why? When Child Protective
Services gets here,

32:14.037 --> 32:15.504
he'll be allowed
to talk to me,

32:15.539 --> 32:17.373
as long as he has
an advocate there, right?

32:17.407 --> 32:20.109
Sorry, <i>cher,</i> Child Protective
Services can't do anything.

32:20.143 --> 32:21.610
His mother hasn't
been charged.

32:21.645 --> 32:23.379
If you want to
talk to him,

32:23.413 --> 32:25.147
Maria has to be
there with you.

32:25.182 --> 32:26.248
He's not gonna
send his mother to jail.

32:26.283 --> 32:28.284
I still want to try.

32:28.318 --> 32:29.852
I don't care if she's there.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.065
<i>I should go in alone.</i>

32:40.099 --> 32:41.933
What? Nuh-uh, no.
That's-that's my room,

32:41.968 --> 32:43.535
my interrogation,
end of story.

32:43.569 --> 32:45.570
So your ego is more important
than catching a killer?

32:45.605 --> 32:47.606
Whoa, we're not gonna play
that game right now, okay?

32:47.640 --> 32:49.107
What'd you bring me
back here for?

32:49.141 --> 32:50.308
Just to hang out?

32:50.343 --> 32:51.576
You said it was
for my insight.

32:51.611 --> 32:53.111
Yeah?
Here it is.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.080
That kid dreams
of a better life.

32:55.114 --> 32:56.715
He dreams of getting out.

32:56.749 --> 32:58.717
That's why he goes
to the Center.

32:58.751 --> 33:00.418
I'm a part of that. You aren't.

33:00.453 --> 33:02.921
If you go in there,
you can kiss the gun good-bye,

33:02.955 --> 33:05.490
you can kiss the whole damn case
good-bye.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.626
And someplace, you know that.

33:08.561 --> 33:09.928
I'll be watching, okay?

33:09.962 --> 33:11.596
And if I feel you're
compromising anything...

33:11.631 --> 33:13.265
I won't.
Great.

33:13.299 --> 33:15.066
I'll make that call, Sweets.

33:15.101 --> 33:17.102
Fair enough.

33:25.478 --> 33:27.979
You left him on his own?
Yeah.

33:28.014 --> 33:30.148
I don't often agree
with Sweets,

33:30.182 --> 33:33.785
but a symbol of authority,
the oppressor as you'd be seen,

33:33.819 --> 33:35.253
would not be helpful in there.

33:35.288 --> 33:37.322
Do you know what
Sweets has planned?

33:37.356 --> 33:38.790
I have no idea.

33:40.226 --> 33:41.626
<i>No digas nada.</i>
<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

33:41.661 --> 33:43.628
<i>Sí, mamá.</i>
My Spanish might suck,

33:43.663 --> 33:45.730
but it's good enough
to understand that.

33:52.004 --> 33:54.739
Look, I wanted
Javier to join us

33:54.774 --> 33:56.908
because what
happens to you

33:56.943 --> 33:58.777
could affect his life
for a very long time.

33:58.811 --> 34:00.779
Even if you send me away,
he's got family.

34:00.813 --> 34:02.314
He'll be fine.
Right, Javier?

34:02.348 --> 34:05.183
You mean the Estrellas?
That's his family?

34:05.217 --> 34:06.985
You think we got anyone
else to count on?

34:07.019 --> 34:08.420
We're gonna call you up
at that community place

34:08.454 --> 34:09.554
so we can
finger-paint ?

34:09.589 --> 34:11.889
We know Jaime killed Adrianna.

34:11.924 --> 34:14.559
We also know that he took
her earrings for you

34:14.594 --> 34:16.328
to make up,
probably for beating you

34:16.362 --> 34:18.530
or cheating on you.
Probably both, right?

34:19.764 --> 34:21.232
That means you had

34:21.266 --> 34:22.634
a reason to kill him, right?

34:22.668 --> 34:24.202
It's a crime
of passion.

34:24.235 --> 34:26.438
If you just admit that,
then the prosecutor

34:26.472 --> 34:28.806
can take that into account
when filing charges.

34:28.841 --> 34:30.241
I didn't kill no one.
Mama...

34:30.275 --> 34:32.243
<i>Te voy a pegar.</i>
<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

34:37.183 --> 34:38.650
If you tell us
where the guns are being kept,

34:38.684 --> 34:40.819
that can make your
deal even better.

34:40.853 --> 34:43.221
Otherwise,
it's maximum security.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.290
Barely get a chance
to see Javier.

34:45.324 --> 34:47.257
He can take care of
himself. Right, Javi?

34:53.299 --> 34:55.000
I know the prosecutor.

34:55.034 --> 34:57.936
She wants to put you up with
a bunch of rival gang members.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.504
You'd be dead within weeks.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.240
He's getting nowhere.

35:02.274 --> 35:03.575
You don't want

35:03.609 --> 35:05.276
your mother to die,
do you, Javier?

35:05.311 --> 35:07.145
If you know something...
He doesn't.

35:07.179 --> 35:09.648
Psychology's not gonna break
through a tribal imperative

35:09.682 --> 35:12.450
that's been ingrained
as a survival mechanism.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.020
Don't you love your mom?

35:19.058 --> 35:20.558
He beat you.

35:20.593 --> 35:21.760
<i>Cállate!</i>

35:27.667 --> 35:30.402
I heard him talking
to Manuel and the others.

35:30.436 --> 35:33.104
He said he'd kill you
if he couldn't tame you.

35:33.139 --> 35:34.506
That was talk, fool!

35:34.540 --> 35:37.275
But you said yourself
you wanted him dead.

35:43.416 --> 35:45.717
I knew you wouldn't, though.

35:49.155 --> 35:51.823
I did it to protect you, Mama.

35:55.928 --> 35:58.263
Oh, my God.

35:58.297 --> 36:00.432
He did it.

36:02.134 --> 36:03.368
What happened?

36:03.402 --> 36:06.671
I knew where he was going
to burn the car.

36:06.706 --> 36:10.608
So I went and told him
I was there to collect the gun.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.245
He showed me the earrings.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.147
I told him
he couldn't buy you.

36:16.182 --> 36:17.982
He slapped me,
said he'd kill me

36:18.017 --> 36:20.685
if I ever looked
at him wrong again.

36:20.720 --> 36:24.422
I had the gun, so...

36:29.228 --> 36:31.629
I did it for you, Mama.

36:33.099 --> 36:35.667
We're family.

36:43.809 --> 36:45.510
<i>¿Cómo pudiste?</i>

36:45.544 --> 36:47.045
<i>Ojalá te pudras!</i>

36:47.079 --> 36:49.314
<i>No te quiero volver</i>
<i>a ver nunca!</i>

36:49.348 --> 36:50.849
Los Estrellas
are my family!

36:50.883 --> 36:52.617
You mean nothing to me!
You hear?! Nothing!

36:52.651 --> 36:54.119
Back her off!
He's your son!

36:54.153 --> 36:55.487
I can make more kids.

36:55.521 --> 36:57.155
Take him! Get him away from me!

36:57.189 --> 36:58.456
Come on, Javier.

36:58.491 --> 37:00.158
It's best if you
come with me now.

37:00.192 --> 37:01.793
I never want
to see you again, you hear?!

37:01.827 --> 37:03.194
I wish he'd killed you!
Easy!

37:11.036 --> 37:13.805
They'll kill me.
Maybe they're right to.

37:13.839 --> 37:16.574
No. We can protect you.
You're a minor.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.376
You felt your life threatened.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.445
This was self-defense.

37:20.479 --> 37:24.482
I promise you, this lady
and Dr. Sweets will make sure

37:24.517 --> 37:26.885
that you live in
a good neighborhood,

37:26.919 --> 37:29.654
go to a good school.
You'll be safe.

37:31.023 --> 37:33.358
<i>If</i> I give you the gun.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.128
If you don't do anything, <i>cher.</i>

37:37.163 --> 37:39.030
The good doctor here would
make my life miserable

37:39.064 --> 37:42.500
if you don't wind up in
the White House one day.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.844
I would do it.

37:52.878 --> 37:55.280
I would give you the gun.

37:59.552 --> 38:01.352
But I don't know
where it is now.

38:01.387 --> 38:03.555
Maybe there was someone

38:03.589 --> 38:05.456
there that your
mother worked with?

38:05.491 --> 38:08.059
Someone that, uh,
you saw at her house,

38:08.093 --> 38:09.394
someone she trusted?

38:10.763 --> 38:12.263
Anna, maybe.

38:12.298 --> 38:16.034
Anna. Is Anna an Estrella?

38:16.068 --> 38:18.136
Yes.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.904
She calls my mother
all the time.

38:19.939 --> 38:22.073
Late at night.

38:22.107 --> 38:24.843
Then she comes by,
and my mother goes out.

38:24.877 --> 38:28.546
Okay. Javier, you tell us
where she is,

38:28.581 --> 38:30.448
and we'll go pick up the gun.

38:30.482 --> 38:33.785
She only comes to us.

38:33.819 --> 38:35.820
When my mother calls.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.755
Maria's cell phone's in holding.

38:37.790 --> 38:39.791
Javier,

38:39.825 --> 38:42.393
will you call Anna for us?

38:50.269 --> 38:52.770
Okay.

38:52.805 --> 38:55.940
I have Javier's mother's
cell number on the grid.

38:55.975 --> 38:57.408
It'll allow us to trace

38:57.443 --> 38:58.804
the location of where
he's calling.

38:58.811 --> 39:01.312
And you can feed
all of that to the FBI?

39:01.347 --> 39:03.615
Booth and his team
are waiting to find out

39:03.649 --> 39:05.416
where the guns are
and when they're being moved.

39:05.451 --> 39:06.885
This is Javier, everyone.

39:06.919 --> 39:09.254
He's gonna call Anna
so you can trace it

39:09.288 --> 39:10.822
and tell Booth
where to pick her up.

39:10.856 --> 39:13.291
Any time you're ready, Javier.

39:25.804 --> 39:27.372
That's Javier's
outgoing call?

39:27.406 --> 39:29.107
Yes.

39:29.141 --> 39:31.476
Anna. Anna. <i>Soy Javier.</i>

39:31.510 --> 39:34.012
<i>La policía se la llevó.</i>
<i>Me dijo...</i>

39:34.046 --> 39:35.980
Come on, come on.

39:36.015 --> 39:37.415
Shouldn't where he's calling
show up right away?

39:37.449 --> 39:38.950
<i>Ahora!</i>

39:42.087 --> 39:44.255
There.
Got it.

39:44.290 --> 39:45.857
That's it. That's Anna.

40:13.886 --> 40:17.388
Freeze! Don't move!

40:20.392 --> 40:22.226
Drop everything.

40:22.261 --> 40:23.328
Hands in the air.

40:23.362 --> 40:25.363
Let me see your hands.

40:27.933 --> 40:29.367
You must be Anna.

40:29.401 --> 40:32.036
<i>No hablo inglés, tranza.</i>

40:35.407 --> 40:38.876
Oh, look at that.

40:52.558 --> 40:55.960
Hey, look who!
Sweets is in town!

40:59.365 --> 41:02.367
As you know, I am
loath to admit it,

41:02.401 --> 41:04.002
but we actually
needed you.

41:04.036 --> 41:06.104
Well, I have no problem
admitting it.

41:06.138 --> 41:07.572
I'm of two minds,

41:07.606 --> 41:09.407
but that might
be the alcohol.

41:09.441 --> 41:11.709
Oh, it's great to have
you back, Sweets.

41:11.744 --> 41:13.444
You're one of the Avengers, man.
We need you.

41:13.479 --> 41:14.645
Here's to Sweets:

41:14.680 --> 41:16.814
my little brother
who I never wanted

41:16.849 --> 41:17.982
but I'm glad that I have.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.584
Welcome home.
Come on.

41:19.618 --> 41:21.352
Lift your glass up there,
will you?

41:21.387 --> 41:23.187
It's bad luck to drink
a toast that isn't true.

41:23.222 --> 41:26.591
It's actually bad luck
not to clink glasses.

41:26.625 --> 41:29.060
Toasts originally evolved
because of fear of poisoning.

41:29.094 --> 41:31.295
The clinking causes
the liquid to spill...

41:31.330 --> 41:33.664
Bones. Yeah.
...into the other person's...

41:33.699 --> 41:36.968
Thank you for that. This has
been an amazing experience.

41:37.002 --> 41:39.337
Um, I love you guys.

41:39.371 --> 41:40.938
But I still have more leave,

41:40.973 --> 41:44.075
and, uh, I guess I'm
seeing things differently.

41:44.109 --> 41:45.443
What are you saying?

41:45.477 --> 41:48.446
Won't it help
if I can give kids a choice

41:48.480 --> 41:50.915
that doesn't involve
picking up a gun?

41:50.949 --> 41:54.185
But you have
a specific talent, Sweets.

41:54.219 --> 41:57.588
That occasionally does
seem quite valuable.

41:57.623 --> 41:59.023
You know what?

41:59.058 --> 42:01.359
Go. Let him go.

42:01.393 --> 42:04.629
He's got to go,
and he's got to do this.

42:04.663 --> 42:07.732
Like all of us
have to do what we do, right?

42:07.766 --> 42:09.567
I'm just taking my leave.
This isn't forever.

42:09.601 --> 42:11.602
Regardless,
before you leave here,

42:11.637 --> 42:13.938
you have to finish your drink.
Yes.

42:13.972 --> 42:15.306
And no matter
what happens,

42:15.340 --> 42:17.141
you're still one of us.

42:17.176 --> 42:18.543
To us.

42:19.445 --> 42:20.511
I'll toast to that.

42:20.546 --> 42:22.613
All right. Hey!
To us!

42:24.883 --> 42:26.217
Clink.

42:26.251 --> 42:27.752
You're gonna break the glasses.
Clink.

42:27.786 --> 42:29.220
Clink.
I don't believe  in superstitions,

42:29.254 --> 42:31.022
but... might as well.

42:31.056 --> 42:32.623
You know what? I have to go.

42:32.658 --> 42:34.692
I promised Javier
that I'd help him get set up

42:34.726 --> 42:35.793
with his foster family, but...

42:35.828 --> 42:37.161
Tell him hello
for us.

42:37.196 --> 42:39.564
I will. Take care.
