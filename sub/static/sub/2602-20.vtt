WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.510
All right, gang, Diet Day Four.

00:03.044 --> 00:04.711
How's everyone holding up?

00:04.746 --> 00:06.814
Honestly, I'm going
to last forever.

00:06.848 --> 00:10.918
You hear that, bitches?

00:10.952 --> 00:12.452
<i>I'm doing great.</i>

00:12.487 --> 00:14.054
This morning
the homeless guy on my stoop

00:14.088 --> 00:15.255
said my skin looked dope.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.590
What's going on?

00:16.624 --> 00:18.425
Why do you all have
matching bags?

00:18.459 --> 00:20.928
We're doing a diet together.
My wife found it.

00:20.962 --> 00:23.330
She heard about it
at Mommy And Me Graphic Design.

00:23.364 --> 00:25.833
Wait, it might've been
Toddler Karate.

00:25.867 --> 00:28.148
She takes our little
ladies to so many classes,

00:28.169 --> 00:29.303
I can't keep it straight.

00:29.337 --> 00:31.138
Childhood is truly
a time of wonder.

00:31.172 --> 00:33.373
<i>This diet is
very scientific, sir.</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:35.808
All the meals are pre-planned
and delivered to your doorstep.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.533
This is our breakfast:

00:37.558 --> 00:40.758
An orange wedge, three cashew nuts...
and a solitarie grape.

00:40.851 --> 00:42.652
It's actually more
than you realize.

00:42.687 --> 00:45.121
Sometimes I can't even finish
all the grape.

00:45.156 --> 00:47.590
This seems unnecessary to me.
You're all in perfect shape.

00:47.625 --> 00:49.326
You can always
be healthier, sir.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.860
<i>And I like the challenge.</i>

00:50.895 --> 00:52.262
Plus, it's good team building.

00:52.296 --> 00:54.264
We're gonna get
through this together.

00:54.298 --> 00:56.132
Hey, guys, pro tip.

00:56.167 --> 00:59.002
Lick the baggie.
There's food molecules in there.

00:59.036 --> 01:00.670
Oh.
Oh, that's so smart.

01:00.705 --> 01:02.539
Mmm.

01:06.101 --> 01:10.601

01:23.928 --> 01:26.596
What are you doing here?
Isn't it your day off?

01:26.630 --> 01:28.798
<i>Yeah, stalker.</i>
<i>It is my day off.</i>

01:28.833 --> 01:30.166
But I am here to meet Charles.

01:30.201 --> 01:31.768
Did you hear what he did
last night?

01:31.802 --> 01:33.903
Drink it, Jake.
Drink it.

01:33.938 --> 01:36.873
What's up your tiny sleeve?

01:36.907 --> 01:39.542
Oh!

01:39.577 --> 01:41.277
Why is there a bow tie in here?

01:41.312 --> 01:42.512
Wait a minute.

01:42.546 --> 01:44.180
Jake Peralta,
will you be my best man?

01:44.215 --> 01:47.317
Yes. Yes!
A thousand times, yes!

01:47.351 --> 01:49.419
Wow.
Best man.

01:49.453 --> 01:52.122
So are you gonna set up shop
in a strip club?

01:52.156 --> 01:53.890
What kind of shop
would I set up?

01:53.924 --> 01:56.426
Hand sanitizer.
I would sell hand sanitizer.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.761
And no.

01:57.795 --> 01:59.195
I was hoping
that my best-man duties

01:59.196 --> 02:00.497
would be all whiskey
and cigars,

02:00.531 --> 02:01.998
but this is Charles
we're talking about.

02:02.033 --> 02:04.034
So we've got two straight days
of wedding planning,

02:04.068 --> 02:06.102
plus, he gave me this to prep.

02:06.137 --> 02:08.405
<i>Fancy</i> Brudgom!

02:08.439 --> 02:10.473
It means "fancy groom"
in Danish.

02:10.508 --> 02:11.875
According to Charles,

02:11.909 --> 02:13.410
the Danes throw the most
beautiful weddings in the world

02:13.444 --> 02:16.279
and the most violent funerals.

02:16.314 --> 02:19.282
This does not look like
something you'd be into.

02:19.317 --> 02:20.550
Normally, yes.

02:20.584 --> 02:22.452
But I am now Charles's
<i>forlover...</i>

02:22.486 --> 02:24.154
"best man," Danish.

02:24.188 --> 02:26.556
So it is my duty
to support him,

02:26.590 --> 02:29.693
no matter what weird, crazy,
Charles-y ideas he has.

02:29.727 --> 02:30.694
Let's do this.

02:30.728 --> 02:32.862
There he is!
My groom!

02:32.897 --> 02:34.698
Hello, my big,
beautiful B.M.!

02:34.732 --> 02:36.333
"Best man."
Just "best man" is fine.

02:36.367 --> 02:37.467
I hope you're rested.

02:37.501 --> 02:38.735
We're gonna be
on our feet all day.

02:38.769 --> 02:40.804
I am totally prepared.
I even bought some nurse shoes.

02:40.838 --> 02:42.806
I love them!
Mm-hmm!

02:42.840 --> 02:45.342
Let me grab this!
Let me grab this!

02:45.376 --> 02:47.077
- Let me grab this!
- Grab me!

02:47.111 --> 02:49.612
First stop,<i> kagesmagning!</i>
Cake tasting!

02:49.647 --> 02:51.481
Wow.

02:51.515 --> 02:53.883
You wanted to see me, sir?

02:53.918 --> 02:55.585
I understand you stopped

02:55.619 --> 02:57.420
by the patrol officers'
morning briefing.

02:57.455 --> 02:58.722
Yeah.

02:58.756 --> 03:00.190
Officer Deetmore helped me out
with my crime scene,

03:00.224 --> 03:01.491
so I gave him a little
thank-you present.

03:01.525 --> 03:02.892
Hey, Deetmore.

03:02.927 --> 03:04.995
If you're gonna bag evidence
like a five-year-old,

03:05.029 --> 03:06.930
you should have
the proper tools.

03:06.964 --> 03:08.832
It's a "My First Police Kit."

03:08.866 --> 03:10.700
The walkie-talkie
blows bubbles.

03:11.869 --> 03:12.969
Hope you can handle it.

03:15.740 --> 03:19.109
He mislabeled the weapon,
like an idiot.

03:19.143 --> 03:20.443
And it almost got filed
with the wrong case.

03:20.478 --> 03:22.012
He could've blown
months of work!

03:22.046 --> 03:24.381
You humiliated Officer Deetmore
in front of his peers.

03:24.415 --> 03:26.983
He submitted an official
complaint against you.

03:27.018 --> 03:28.178
Did he fill it out in crayon?

03:28.185 --> 03:29.419
No.

03:29.453 --> 03:31.554
But he did use a green pen,
which seems crazy to me.

03:31.589 --> 03:34.624
The good news is, if you go
down there and apologize,

03:34.659 --> 03:36.226
he'll let the whole thing go.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.861
Fine. I'm great
at apologizing.

03:37.895 --> 03:39.129
I'm a very sweet person.

03:39.763 --> 03:40.997
Out of my way, Chunk.

03:41.032 --> 03:42.532
Ooh!

03:42.566 --> 03:47.270
Jake, I got to tell ya,
the engaged life is amazing,

03:47.305 --> 03:49.539
- especially sexually.
- Well, I don't want to pry.

03:49.573 --> 03:51.207
- You're not prying. I want
you to know this.    - No.

03:51.242 --> 03:53.310
Vivian and I have a wonderful
intercourse itinerary

03:53.344 --> 03:55.545
- that we have planned.
- Ah, ha!

03:55.579 --> 03:56.979
I'm usually more
of a chocolate guy,

03:56.981 --> 03:59.149
but this one's closer,
so I'm gonna do that.

03:59.183 --> 04:01.117
Oh!
Hot, hot!

04:01.152 --> 04:02.252
Spicy cake!
Why?

04:02.286 --> 04:03.853
That's habanero pepper
frosting,

04:03.888 --> 04:06.022
because our marriage
is going to...

04:08.459 --> 04:09.893
Unless you think
it's a bad idea.

04:09.927 --> 04:12.028
No.

04:12.063 --> 04:14.164
Sounds like
a great idea, Oprah.

04:14.198 --> 04:17.634
Two... One.

04:17.668 --> 04:19.235
Okay, be kind.

04:19.269 --> 04:20.637
I don't have
a model's body like you.

04:20.671 --> 04:22.005
Come on, show me what you got.

04:23.608 --> 04:25.609
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly.

04:25.643 --> 04:27.344
Liberace, Diane keaton.

04:27.378 --> 04:28.545
Roger that.

04:28.579 --> 04:30.113
God.

04:30.147 --> 04:34.117
<i>Charles, Charles.</i>
<i>You're not Scottish.</i>

04:34.151 --> 04:35.752
<i>Yeah, get back in there,</i>
<i>Braveheart.</i>

04:35.786 --> 04:37.487
Summer linen suit...

04:37.521 --> 04:39.389
casual but classic.

04:39.423 --> 04:40.924
Actually not bad.

04:40.958 --> 04:42.993
One question...
can you see my underwear?

04:43.027 --> 04:45.662
Ah, thong!
Why are you wearing a thong?

04:45.696 --> 04:47.063
It's my something borrowed.

04:47.098 --> 04:49.132
Get back in there.

04:50.267 --> 04:51.334
Yes!

04:51.369 --> 04:52.402
Lunchtime.
Wait's over.

04:52.436 --> 04:54.037
- That was easy.
- Totally.

04:54.071 --> 04:55.372
I feel like we just
had our snack

04:55.406 --> 04:56.806
an hour and 17 minutes ago.

04:56.841 --> 04:58.608
I never got into diets...

04:58.643 --> 05:01.177
Though I did take diet pills
in the '70s.

05:01.212 --> 05:04.914
I love these pills.
They give me so much energy.

05:04.949 --> 05:08.051
And I can eat whatever I want.

05:08.085 --> 05:10.253
Oh, God!

05:13.024 --> 05:14.958
He's dead!

05:14.992 --> 05:17.294
Actually, I was in a coma.

05:17.328 --> 05:19.262
When I woke up,
I had so much mail.

05:19.297 --> 05:21.564
Weight-loss science
has come a long way since then.

05:21.599 --> 05:23.500
Mm-hmm.

05:23.534 --> 05:26.603
"Ingredients... carrot."
Got to respect that.

05:26.637 --> 05:28.805
Damn, Gina!

05:28.839 --> 05:30.006
What is that?

05:30.041 --> 05:32.275
Oh, it's a sloppy Jessica.

05:32.310 --> 05:35.478
Mac 'n' cheese, chili,
pizza on a bun.

05:35.513 --> 05:37.113
<i>It's everything</i>
<i>I've wanted to eat</i>

05:37.148 --> 05:39.649
for the last 48 hours.

05:39.684 --> 05:42.152
Mmm. Mmm.

05:42.186 --> 05:43.386
What happened?

05:43.421 --> 05:46.056
I thought you were gonna
"last forever, bitches!"

05:46.090 --> 05:47.857
Turns out I gave up easy.

05:47.892 --> 05:49.492
You hear that, bitches?

05:49.527 --> 05:52.362
I gave up so easy!

05:53.631 --> 05:54.698
Thank you!

05:54.732 --> 05:56.053
Hey, are you sure
it's a good idea

05:56.067 --> 05:57.934
to eat all this shawarma
right before your tux fitting?

05:57.969 --> 05:59.269
Oh, yeah.

05:59.303 --> 06:00.637
I'm not gonna be one
of those grooms who doesn't eat.

06:00.671 --> 06:02.038
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

06:02.073 --> 06:03.540
Thanks for being
so supportive all day.

06:03.574 --> 06:05.709
Best man...
whatever you need, I will do.

06:05.743 --> 06:07.510
Actually, there is one thing.

06:07.545 --> 06:09.212
Do you have a pen I could borrow
to sign these forms?

06:09.246 --> 06:11.448
You bet I don't have a pen.
I never do.

06:11.482 --> 06:13.049
But I will get you one.

06:13.084 --> 06:14.751
What is it, some sort
of marriage license thingy?

06:14.785 --> 06:16.152
Oh, no, it's
my retirement paperwork.

06:16.187 --> 06:18.021
What? Shut up. What? Yeah.

06:18.055 --> 06:19.823
Vivian got a job
in suburban Ottawa.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.158
She wants me to retire from
the NYPD and go with her.

06:22.193 --> 06:23.493
Retire?

06:23.527 --> 06:25.328
Boyle, we're supposed to
die on the force together...

06:25.363 --> 06:26.730
me in a big explosion,

06:26.764 --> 06:28.732
and you committing suicide
at my funeral out of respect.

06:28.766 --> 06:30.000
I know.

06:30.034 --> 06:32.302
But Vivian needs to make
this move for her career,

06:32.336 --> 06:33.970
and I'm excited to go.

06:34.005 --> 06:35.705
I mean,
suburban Ottawa's great.

06:35.740 --> 06:37.240
It has everything
Brooklyn does.

06:37.275 --> 06:39.175
- Really?
- Yes...

06:39.210 --> 06:41.811
Other than my job
and my friends and my family,

06:41.846 --> 06:45.048
you, interesting people,
museums, restaurants,

06:45.082 --> 06:47.017
every other reason
that I have to live.

06:47.051 --> 06:49.185
Okay, I'm kind of picking up
on a couple of clues

06:49.220 --> 06:51.221
that you maybe don't want
to retire in Canada.

06:51.255 --> 06:52.489
Oh, my God.

06:52.523 --> 06:53.590
Jake, you're such
an amazing detective.

06:54.124 --> 06:55.424
I don't want to go.

06:56.472 --> 06:57.839
Okay, Boyle, let's strategize

06:57.873 --> 06:59.140
on how you're gonna tell Vivian

06:59.174 --> 07:00.508
that you don't want to move
to Canada.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.909
No, Jake, I'm not
gonna say anything.

07:01.944 --> 07:03.111
Just drop it.

07:03.145 --> 07:04.379
We have the perfect
relationship.

07:04.413 --> 07:05.546
We've never fought.

07:05.581 --> 07:06.648
I don't want to mess up
and ruin it.

07:06.682 --> 07:07.815
She's my everything.

07:07.850 --> 07:09.183
- Move your testicles to the left.
- 10-4.

07:09.218 --> 07:10.351
She's your fiancee.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.853
You can't be scared
to talk to her.

07:11.878 --> 07:13.321
Testicles to the right...

07:13.322 --> 07:15.723
You know, can we actually cool it
on the testicles for a minute?

07:15.758 --> 07:17.392
No, I'm on the testicle part.

07:18.927 --> 07:20.828
Honestly, Jake, I wouldn't
even know how to bring it up.

07:20.863 --> 07:21.996
What if it goes badly?

07:22.031 --> 07:23.998
It won't.
Just tell her how you feel.

07:24.033 --> 07:25.900
Say something like,
"Vivian, I love you,

07:25.934 --> 07:27.435
but we need to talk
about Ottawa."

07:27.469 --> 07:30.571
Right. And then she'll say,
"you're a selfish man-pig,

07:30.606 --> 07:32.940
and I hope you die alone,
and I never loved you."

07:32.975 --> 07:34.709
Oh, God.
She never loved me.

07:34.743 --> 07:36.144
She's not gonna say any of that

07:36.178 --> 07:37.979
because she's not
criminally insane.

07:38.013 --> 07:39.380
<i>Okay, just calm down.</i>

07:39.415 --> 07:40.736
We'll think of something
together.

07:40.749 --> 07:42.083
We're going
to the stationery store next.

07:42.117 --> 07:43.318
We can write
a bunch of stuff down.

07:43.352 --> 07:45.520
It's gonna be all right.
Take a deep breath.

07:45.554 --> 07:47.121
No deep breaths.

07:47.156 --> 07:48.923
Makes the testicles clap.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.325
Mm.

07:50.359 --> 07:51.926
Detective Diaz.

07:51.961 --> 07:53.895
How's your apology
to officer Deetmore coming?

07:53.929 --> 07:55.530
I've been working on a letter
to send him.

07:55.564 --> 07:57.198
Yes, I saw a draft of it
on your desk.

07:57.232 --> 07:58.566
What did you think?

07:58.600 --> 08:01.135
It was so horrifying,
I had to destroy the whole pad.

08:02.938 --> 08:05.940
Just go downstairs
and apologize.

08:05.975 --> 08:08.076
Fine.
I'll say, "I'm sorry."

08:08.110 --> 08:10.144
No, be sincere, like this...

08:10.179 --> 08:12.146
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

08:12.181 --> 08:14.148
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

08:14.183 --> 08:15.350
I'm sorry.

08:15.384 --> 08:16.384
I'm sorry.

08:16.418 --> 08:18.353
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

08:18.387 --> 08:19.787
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

08:19.822 --> 08:21.189
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

08:21.223 --> 08:23.424
Good.
That's the one.

08:23.709 --> 08:26.510
Still working
on that afternoon almond?

08:26.545 --> 08:29.480
I've been sucking on it so long,
it's smooth.

08:29.514 --> 08:31.449
- It's like sea glass.
- You do you.

08:35.287 --> 08:36.486
I'll get that for you, Ames.

08:39.691 --> 08:40.825
Oops!

08:40.859 --> 08:42.058
Butter feet...
sorry about that.

08:42.059 --> 08:45.696
Sorry? You bumbling
son of a bitch!

08:45.731 --> 08:47.531
You just ruined my life!

08:47.566 --> 08:49.000
I hope you get hit by a truck

08:49.034 --> 08:50.535
and a dog takes a dump
on your face!

08:50.569 --> 08:51.702
Nothing to see here...

08:51.737 --> 08:53.204
just a little
hypoglycemic rage.

08:53.238 --> 08:54.338
Move along.

08:54.373 --> 08:57.041
I'm so sorry, Hitchcock.
That's not me.

08:57.075 --> 08:58.743
I'm never like that.

08:58.777 --> 09:00.244
That's okay.
It was my fault.

09:00.279 --> 09:02.146
I shouldn't have bumped
your cashew.

09:02.181 --> 09:05.049
Cashew?
It was an almond, you idiot!

09:05.083 --> 09:06.851
I hope you drown in a tub!

09:06.885 --> 09:10.655
I hope you have aneurysm
after aneurysm after aneurysm!

09:10.689 --> 09:12.223
<i>Okay, buddy.</i>

09:12.257 --> 09:13.897
We have got some great
opening lines here,

09:13.926 --> 09:16.227
three very reasonable
explanations

09:16.261 --> 09:17.762
as to why you don't want
to go to Canada,

09:17.796 --> 09:21.666
and four very attractive options
for your invitation card stock.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.635
Well, I like
" Romantic Opening 'C.' "

09:24.670 --> 09:26.737
this page about how my life
is New York,

09:26.772 --> 09:29.874
and I love the Chantilly Ecru
paper for place cards.

09:29.908 --> 09:31.609
That is an excellent choice.

09:31.643 --> 09:33.578
Those are all
excellent choices.

09:33.612 --> 09:34.579
You can do this.

09:34.613 --> 09:35.893
You're a smart
and wonderful man.

09:35.914 --> 09:37.682
With fantastic handwriting.

09:37.716 --> 09:39.183
Sure, with fantastic
handwriting.

09:39.218 --> 09:40.618
You really think so?

09:40.652 --> 09:42.887
Yeah, I think that you could be
a professional calligrapher.

09:42.921 --> 09:45.423
Charles,
a professional calligrapher.

09:45.457 --> 09:47.391
You can do anything,

09:47.426 --> 09:49.927
including, but not limited to,
talking to Vivian.

09:49.962 --> 09:52.797
Right.
Right. Right.

09:52.831 --> 09:54.632
Look, I know
it's gonna be hard.

09:54.666 --> 09:56.067
And she might even
get mad at you.

09:56.101 --> 09:58.069
But I promise you will be back
to doing weird sex stuff

09:58.103 --> 09:59.237
together in no time.

09:59.271 --> 10:01.272
All right.

10:01.306 --> 10:03.574
All right,
I'm gonna go talk to Vivi.

10:03.609 --> 10:06.143
Great idea, buddy!
Eh?

10:06.178 --> 10:07.278
- Yep!
- <i>Yeah!</i>

10:07.312 --> 10:09.380
So who's gonna pay
for the paper?

10:09.414 --> 10:12.383
It's gonna be $250.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.285
Her name is Amy Santiago.

10:14.319 --> 10:16.354
<i>Lick, lick, lick.</i>

10:16.388 --> 10:18.656
It's an ice cream cone.

10:18.690 --> 10:21.058
You can't tempt me, traitor,

10:21.093 --> 10:23.628
not when I got this big,
juicy cantaloupe wedge

10:23.662 --> 10:25.963
to keep me company.

10:25.998 --> 10:27.932
It's so thin
I can see through it.

10:27.966 --> 10:29.800
Santiago!

10:29.835 --> 10:32.036
Come hold this so it looks
bigger in your tiny hand.

10:32.070 --> 10:34.605
Aw, Amy left the building
20 minutes ago.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.940
That doesn't make sense.

10:35.974 --> 10:38.209
Santiago loves cantaloupe time.

10:38.243 --> 10:39.844
We wrote a song about it.

10:43.015 --> 10:45.483
It's just nonsense without
her singing the high parts.

10:45.517 --> 10:47.785
Where is she?

10:49.922 --> 10:52.623
<i>Amy, where are you?
It's cantaloupe time!</i>

10:53.625 --> 10:55.393
Santiago!
Stop!

10:55.427 --> 10:56.561
It's not too late.

10:56.595 --> 10:57.929
<i>I failed, Sarge.</i>

10:57.963 --> 11:00.298
This is my second burger.

11:00.332 --> 11:02.600
Okay, I lied.
It's my fourth!

11:02.634 --> 11:05.570
You both betrayed me.
That's okay.

11:05.604 --> 11:07.271
I can do this all on my own,
I don't need you!

11:07.306 --> 11:08.973
<i>I can even sing the high parts!</i>

11:13.545 --> 11:15.146
Traitors!

11:15.180 --> 11:17.682
Officer Deetmore...

11:17.716 --> 11:19.083
I came down here
to say I'm sorry.

11:19.117 --> 11:20.685
Oh, good.
Go ahead.

11:20.719 --> 11:22.653
No, that was it. I did it.
I said, "I'm sorry."

11:22.688 --> 11:23.654
Hey, I said it again.

11:23.689 --> 11:24.729
Now I got one in the bank,

11:24.756 --> 11:25.957
so I can do
whatever I want to you.

11:25.991 --> 11:27.191
What are you even sorry for?

11:27.226 --> 11:28.292
Come on, man.

11:28.327 --> 11:30.328
I said the words.
I paused afterwards.

11:30.362 --> 11:32.363
I even averted my gaze
to make you feel like the Alpha.

11:32.397 --> 11:33.664
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

11:33.699 --> 11:36.133
I'd like you to apologize
like you mean it.

11:36.168 --> 11:38.135
Fine.

11:38.170 --> 11:40.838
I'm sorry
you screwed up my case.

11:40.873 --> 11:43.307
I'm sorry
you're a terrible cop.

11:43.342 --> 11:46.010
I'm sorry for your goat face
and your rodent brain

11:46.044 --> 11:48.713
and your weird goose body.

11:48.747 --> 11:50.648
I meant all of that.

11:50.682 --> 11:53.518
Hope you feel better.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.654
Hey!

11:56.688 --> 11:58.789
So? How'd it go
with Vivian last night?

11:58.824 --> 12:00.758
Great.
It went so great.

12:00.792 --> 12:03.628
I went to her apartment.
I sat down face-to-face.

12:03.662 --> 12:05.363
Then I panicked
and totally bailed.

12:05.397 --> 12:06.564
Oh, no.

12:06.598 --> 12:08.266
But the good news is,
she's on her way here,

12:08.300 --> 12:10.301
- and you're gonna talk to her for me.
- Oh, no.

12:10.335 --> 12:11.569
Just tell her I absolutely
shouldn't retire

12:11.603 --> 12:13.037
and move to Canada,
but don't tell her I think that.

12:13.071 --> 12:14.472
- Hi!
- Hi, Vivian!

12:14.506 --> 12:15.473
Mwah!

12:15.507 --> 12:16.474
Hi, Jake!

12:16.508 --> 12:19.243
Vivian!

12:21.035 --> 12:22.368
Jake, you're so sweet!

12:22.403 --> 12:23.703
Charles told me you insisted
that I come to breakfast.

12:24.237 --> 12:26.806
Because of it being
such an important one.

12:26.840 --> 12:27.973
Meal, I mean.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.775
You know that in ancient Egypt,

12:29.810 --> 12:31.477
the peasants drank beer
for breakfast?

12:31.511 --> 12:33.946
Well, that explains why all
their buildings were crooked.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.748
Charles, can I see you
in the bathroom for a second?

12:35.782 --> 12:37.883
I've got a mole on my back
that needs a looking-at,

12:37.918 --> 12:39.318
and Charles has eyes.

12:39.352 --> 12:41.153
I do.

12:42.455 --> 12:43.622
All right,
so let's see that mole.

12:43.657 --> 12:45.958
What? Get off of me!
That was a fake excuse.

12:45.992 --> 12:47.326
Of course.
Totally.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.795
Look, I can't talk to Vivian
for you. This is crazy.

12:49.830 --> 12:52.031
I tried talking to
her, just like we practiced.

12:52.065 --> 12:53.632
But every time
I bring up Ottawa,

12:53.667 --> 12:55.467
she says how excited
she is about our future.

12:55.502 --> 12:56.669
Then we made love.

12:56.703 --> 12:57.970
Don't say "made love."

12:58.004 --> 12:59.138
Fine, we had wonder-sex.

12:59.172 --> 13:00.539
I don't want to know
what that is.

13:00.574 --> 13:01.674
I don't want to move to Canada.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.008
But I can't lose her.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.344
You're my best man.
Please help me.

13:05.378 --> 13:07.680
Fine. I'll try.

13:07.714 --> 13:09.615
Okay,
but bring it up naturally,

13:09.649 --> 13:10.983
so she doesn't think
I put you up to it.

13:11.017 --> 13:12.251
Sure.
How hard could that be?

13:12.285 --> 13:14.086
I'm constantly talking
about suburban Ottawa.

13:15.722 --> 13:17.923
Wait, don't go!
I still have to pee.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.425
Why would I stay for that?

13:20.494 --> 13:21.894
Is it cool if I just stare
at your croissants

13:21.928 --> 13:23.095
for a little while?

13:23.130 --> 13:24.196
Sarge!

13:24.231 --> 13:25.664
You need to stop this diet.

13:25.699 --> 13:27.266
Amy and I folded.
You won.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.169
It's not a competition.
We were on the same team,

13:30.203 --> 13:33.572
until you deserted me
for team eating food!

13:33.607 --> 13:36.008
Was that a good burn?
I'm too hungry to tell.

13:36.042 --> 13:39.111
It was a great burn, sir.
Now please eat. You look weak.

13:39.146 --> 13:40.513
I'm fine.

13:40.547 --> 13:42.081
I am stronger than ever!

13:42.115 --> 13:44.116
Watch this.

13:45.418 --> 13:46.452
Sarge, what are you...
what are you doing?

13:46.486 --> 13:47.553
No, no, no, no, no.
No!

13:48.588 --> 13:50.189
Wow.

13:51.458 --> 13:54.627
See? I'm fine!

13:54.661 --> 13:56.362
What is happening?

13:56.396 --> 13:59.298
Just a tummy gurgle.
Diet messed up my system.

13:59.332 --> 14:01.033
Oh, no.

14:05.572 --> 14:08.040
Go back inside!

14:08.074 --> 14:10.643
Are you talking to us
or the fart?

14:10.677 --> 14:14.246
So, Vivian,
do you ever go watch hockey?

14:14.281 --> 14:16.215
No, I'm not one for sports.

14:16.249 --> 14:17.550
Of course you're not.

14:17.584 --> 14:21.387
My graduate student told me the
craziest story about her family.

14:21.421 --> 14:22.988
That's hilarious!

14:23.023 --> 14:25.224
Hey, can you pass me
the maple syrup, please?

14:25.258 --> 14:27.760
Speaking of, where does the best
maple syrup come from again?

14:27.794 --> 14:29.428
Vermont.

14:29.463 --> 14:31.397
Oh, and Canada.

14:31.431 --> 14:33.732
Canada?
Hey, that reminds me.

14:33.767 --> 14:35.734
Weren't the two of you talking
about maybe moving there?

14:35.769 --> 14:37.403
Oh, yeah, we are so excited

14:37.437 --> 14:39.605
to start this new chapter
of our lives together.

14:39.639 --> 14:41.340
Yeah. Well, although
I have to say,

14:41.374 --> 14:44.844
as someone who's read many of the
older chapters in Charles's life,

14:44.878 --> 14:46.245
I wonder if that's
the best thing for him.

14:46.279 --> 14:48.981
That's so sweet of you
to care, but...

14:49.015 --> 14:51.317
Chuck is excited about moving
to Canada, right, baby?

14:51.351 --> 14:53.819
Mm, mouth full.
I love you.

14:53.854 --> 14:55.754
But what about his job
and all of his friends

14:55.789 --> 14:57.690
and his Brooklyn-based
pizza blog?

14:57.724 --> 14:59.592
Do they even have pizza
in Canada?

14:59.626 --> 15:01.994
Yes, it's puffier,
and it's sweet.

15:02.028 --> 15:03.662
It's called Manitoba Sauce Cake.

15:03.697 --> 15:05.631
Okay, there's no way
Charles wants that.

15:05.665 --> 15:07.800
Jake, I think
you're overstepping here.

15:07.834 --> 15:09.602
Charles and I both
want to move to Canada.

15:09.636 --> 15:13.539
Is that true, Charles?
Is that what you want?

15:15.842 --> 15:17.543
Uh, yeah.

15:17.577 --> 15:20.846
I want to retire from the force
and move to Ottawa with Vivian.

15:20.881 --> 15:24.316
And frankly, I have no idea
why you're getting involved.

15:24.351 --> 15:26.886
And no one asked
for your stupid opinion.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.621
Vivi...

15:28.655 --> 15:30.823
We're leaving.

15:30.857 --> 15:32.224
What?

15:32.259 --> 15:33.959
Detective Diaz...

15:33.994 --> 15:35.928
I gather that, once again,
things did not go well

15:35.962 --> 15:37.196
with Officer Deetmore.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.732
All due respect, sir,
it's how I was trained.

15:39.766 --> 15:41.467
You mess up,
you get made fun of.

15:41.501 --> 15:43.135
It's like scientist
zapping a rat

15:43.170 --> 15:44.503
when it messes up in a maze.

15:44.538 --> 15:45.805
Oh, I get it.

15:45.839 --> 15:47.206
When I was a young officer,

15:47.240 --> 15:50.042
I was that rat and got zapped.

15:50.076 --> 15:51.710
And all I wanted
was to be captain

15:51.745 --> 15:53.045
and throw some lightning bolts.

15:53.079 --> 15:55.848
Emperor Palpatine.

15:55.882 --> 15:57.650
I do not know who that is.

15:57.684 --> 16:00.886
But a real leader doesn't zap
people when they mess up.

16:00.921 --> 16:04.190
They teach them
how to fix the problem.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.692
I think you're a leader.

16:06.726 --> 16:08.160
So act like one.

16:08.195 --> 16:11.397
I'll try.
I'm sorry.

16:11.431 --> 16:14.133
Please, Diaz.
No need to make a scene.

16:15.602 --> 16:17.603
- I can't believe he's moving to Canada.
- I know.

16:17.637 --> 16:20.473
And I tried to help him, and he
fully threw me under the bus.

16:20.507 --> 16:21.774
So I quit as best man.

16:21.808 --> 16:23.042
- Jake.
- What?

16:23.076 --> 16:24.376
I did everything right.

16:24.411 --> 16:26.545
I was loyal. I put up
with all his dumb ideas,

16:26.580 --> 16:29.348
his spicy cake, his champagne
made out of olives,

16:29.382 --> 16:31.717
reading his vows as a recipe.

16:31.752 --> 16:33.719
"One teaspoon eternal love,

16:33.753 --> 16:36.021
a dash of peeing
with the door open."

16:36.056 --> 16:37.690
Okay.
That's hard to hear.

16:37.724 --> 16:39.058
Yeah.

16:39.092 --> 16:40.860
I just don't understand
why he's being so weird.

16:40.894 --> 16:42.628
I can't believe he would
turn on me like this.

16:42.662 --> 16:43.963
He's not being himself.

16:43.997 --> 16:45.965
Maybe because he's facing
a terrible decision

16:45.999 --> 16:48.200
and he doesn't know what to do.

16:48.235 --> 16:50.102
Yeah, that sounds right.

16:50.137 --> 16:51.904
I think he needs
his farm lover.

16:51.938 --> 16:53.239
It's pronounced "for-lohver."

16:53.273 --> 16:54.540
I don't have time
to teach you Danish.

16:54.574 --> 16:55.608
I gotta go help Charles!

16:55.642 --> 16:57.109
I'll find out where he is
and text you.

16:57.143 --> 16:58.643
<i>That would be helpful!</i>

17:00.802 --> 17:03.470
- Charles, get in the car.
- No!

17:03.505 --> 17:05.239
Go to heck!

17:05.522 --> 17:06.757
Don't siren me.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.359
You quit on me as best man,
I'm not talking to you.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.730
Police.
Stop walking.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.634
Ah, I hate
that I'm so by the book.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.202
Listen, Boyle,

17:18.236 --> 17:19.403
you're not handing in
those retirement papers

17:19.436 --> 17:20.637
without telling Vivian
how you feel.

17:20.672 --> 17:21.805
I won't let you.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.480
Oh, really?
And how are you gonna stop me?

17:23.508 --> 17:24.474
Baton to the knee.

17:24.509 --> 17:26.577
Baton to the knee?

17:26.611 --> 17:28.913
Ahh! Oh!

17:29.948 --> 17:32.316
Hey, Deetmore.

17:32.350 --> 17:35.586
I'm sorry for making fun of you
in front of everybody...

17:35.620 --> 17:37.788
And also for making fun of you
behind your back.

17:37.822 --> 17:40.491
Didn't know you did that,
but thank you for the apology.

17:40.525 --> 17:41.859
I'm not done.

17:41.893 --> 17:43.761
Also, I'm sorry for making fun
of you during my book club.

17:43.795 --> 17:44.828
Those people don't even
know you.

17:44.863 --> 17:45.930
That was uncool.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.231
Also, I'm sorry...

17:47.265 --> 17:48.599
it's okay.
I get it.

17:48.633 --> 17:49.800
No.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.802
Also, I'm sorry that
I didn't take the time

17:51.836 --> 17:54.505
to show you
how to fix your mistake.

17:54.539 --> 17:56.574
Come on,
we can go over it upstairs.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.176
Thanks.
That'd be great.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.579
Oh, one more sorry.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.514
You're about to see a drawing
I did of you in the elevator.

18:03.548 --> 18:05.482
Just remember I was really
pissed at you at the time.

18:09.821 --> 18:11.956
I'm unquitting
as your best man.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.290
Oh, how kind of you.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.259
Are you also taking me
to the knee hospital?

18:15.293 --> 18:16.727
Your knee is fine.

18:16.761 --> 18:18.062
Besides, you had it coming

18:18.096 --> 18:19.330
for throwing me
under the bus like that.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.665
I'm sorry.
I was terrible to you.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.268
It's just I don't know
what to do.

18:24.302 --> 18:25.970
I know, it's tough.

18:26.004 --> 18:27.304
But I'm here to support you

18:27.339 --> 18:29.440
and not just in your weird,
awful wedding decisions.

18:29.474 --> 18:30.774
"Awful"?

18:30.809 --> 18:32.943
Uh-oh. Did I just plan
the worst wedding in history?

18:32.978 --> 18:35.613
Second worst.
Red Wedding,<i> Game Of Thrones.</i>

18:35.647 --> 18:37.982
<i>And, no, your wedding</i>
<i>is gonna be incredible</i>

18:38.016 --> 18:39.650
because it's exactly
what you want.

18:39.684 --> 18:41.552
What you don't want
is to go to Canada.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.021
So I don't care how many buses
you throw me under,

18:44.055 --> 18:45.623
I'm making you talk to Vivian.

18:45.657 --> 18:49.059
Okay, thanks.
You're right.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.795
And you know what?
I'm ready.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.230
No, I'm not!
I'm running away!

18:53.265 --> 18:54.732
Boyle, no!

18:54.766 --> 18:56.486
I'm not ready! I'm not ready!
I'm not ready!

18:56.501 --> 18:59.169
Hey, superstar.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.572
Why the long fart?
Oh, I meant "face."

19:01.606 --> 19:02.907
Why the long face?

19:02.941 --> 19:04.041
Keep walking, Linetti.

19:04.075 --> 19:06.710
Okay, but this shake
is really good.

19:06.745 --> 19:07.845
Listen. Shh, shh.

19:07.879 --> 19:09.179
Listen.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.216
That's it!
I give up.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.851
Why do you care so much
about this diet?

19:13.885 --> 19:15.986
Just stop.
You're in perfect shape.

19:16.021 --> 19:17.721
Mm! Amen!

19:17.756 --> 19:19.056
I'm not doing it for me.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.724
My wife is on a diet.

19:20.759 --> 19:22.359
She's a little self-conscious
about her body

19:22.394 --> 19:23.727
since giving birth to twins.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.095
It's crazy!

19:25.130 --> 19:26.297
I think she looks perfect,

19:26.331 --> 19:27.565
and I tell her that
all the time.

19:27.599 --> 19:30.100
Mm, and I love
that you do that, Terry.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.136
She's running around
after those girls all day,

19:32.170 --> 19:33.604
and I'm not there to help out.

19:33.638 --> 19:36.006
This was one thing
I thought I could do with her.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.542
But I'm too weak.

19:38.577 --> 19:41.212
Just hand me that milkshake.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.681
Okay.

19:43.715 --> 19:46.083
Hey, what are you doing?
What...

19:46.117 --> 19:47.518
Thank you.

19:47.552 --> 19:48.886
We are still a team,

19:48.920 --> 19:51.789
and we will keep you from eating
so you can support your wife.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.490
Thank you, team.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.806
However, just to be clear,
Gina and I are still gonna eat.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.762
I'm eating right now,
Terry... corndog.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.631
Come on.
There we go.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.634
You got this, all right?

20:05.237 --> 20:07.404
Ah, hello, Vivian.
Charles has something

20:07.439 --> 20:09.807
he'd like to say.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.275
In case he tries to flee.

20:16.147 --> 20:18.582
Vivian...

20:18.617 --> 20:20.251
We need to talk about Ottawa.

20:22.176 --> 20:24.276
___

20:27.392 --> 20:30.361
Jake.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.396
Oh.

20:33.798 --> 20:35.933
Hey.

20:35.967 --> 20:37.601
How'd it go?
Everything okay?

20:37.636 --> 20:39.703
Vivian and I talked for hours.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.739
There's a lot more to discuss,
but it's a start.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.173
And you were right.
She didn't dump me.

20:43.208 --> 20:46.510
You did good.
I know you were scared.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.712
Hey...

20:48.747 --> 20:51.749
Your duties as best man
aren't over yet.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.118
What?
Whiskey and cigars!

20:54.152 --> 20:55.853
Mm-hmm.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.755
Thanks for being
the best best man.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.157
To the fancy <i> brudgom!</i>

21:02.827 --> 21:05.596
Ah! Ah, spicy!
Why is that spicy?

21:05.630 --> 21:07.331
Not a doctor. Shh.
