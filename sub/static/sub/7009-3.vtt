IT'S NOT STUPID.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.690

NOT GONNA LOVE IT.

00:24.858 --> 00:28.318
OK. THAT'S TIME.
STEP AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

OH, MY GOD. FINALLY.

I AM SO DEHYDRATED.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.879

YOU KNOW, THERE'S A HOSE
IN THE BACKYARD.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.851
I'VE NOTICED THAT
THE POP SELECTION

01:01.019 --> 01:03.520
HAS REALLY WENT DOWNHILL
SINCE YOUR DAD GOT LAID OFF.

01:03.688 --> 01:08.317
HE'S... NOT LAID OFF.
HE'S JUST PART-TIME.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.402

01:17.368 --> 01:19.995
THE PRESIDENT OF THESE

40th... I DON'T KNOW.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.172
WHY WOULD FORD
COME TO POINT PLACE?

01:30.340 --> 01:33.175
BECAUSE WE ARE
A WHISTLE STOP

01:33.343 --> 01:35.177
ALONG HIS WISCONSIN
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.805
MY DAD ORGANIZED IT.

01:41.726 --> 01:47.231

02:45.206 --> 02:46.582
REAL GOOD.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.667
BY "REAL GOOD," YOU MEAN
YOU ROTATED THOSE TIRES

02:48.835 --> 02:51.461
LIKE I ASKED YOU TO?

02:51.629 --> 02:55.507
DAD, DON'T THEY ROTATE
EVERY TIME I DRIVE?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.349
YOU BEING
A SMART MOUTH?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.393
YES.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.520
AND I'M SORRY.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.815
TUNA CASSEROLE AGAIN?

03:13.610 --> 03:15.819
WELL, OK. HOW ABOUT WE
DON'T PAY THE CAR INSURANCE,

03:15.987 --> 03:17.362
AND WE'LL ALL
HAVE STEAK?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.364
ALL RIGHT.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.742
HA HA HA!

03:21.910 --> 03:24.244
WELL, JUST IMAGINE.
PRESIDENT FORD IS COMING HERE.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.747
HA HA!

03:26.915 --> 03:27.664
UH, RED,
WE NEED TO GET RID

03:27.832 --> 03:31.501
OF THE OIL STAINS
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.753
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S
COMING TO OUR HOUSE,

03:32.921 --> 03:36.548
AND IF HE DID,
I'D KICK HIM IN THE KEISTER.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.800
OH, STOP IT.
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

03:38.968 --> 03:41.178
YOU VOTED FOR
GERALD FORD.

03:41.346 --> 03:46.391
KITTY, NO ONE VOTED
FOR GERALD FORD.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.809
HA HA HA!

03:47.977 --> 03:50.938
BUT HE STILL IS
OUR PRESIDENT.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.440
OH, THE BOY'S OLD ENOUGH
TO HEAR THAT KIND OF TALK.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.777
ERIC, SAY THAT YOUR JOB
WAS SENT TO A PLANT IN...

03:56.945 --> 03:59.863
GUADALA-WHO-THE-HELL-CARES.

04:00.031 --> 04:04.243
NOW, ARE YOU GONNA VOTE FOR
THE GUY THAT LET THAT HAPPEN?

04:04.410 --> 04:06.119
RED, PRESIDENT FORD
DIDN'T TAKE YOUR JOB.

04:06.287 --> 04:10.415
HE TOOK NIXON'S.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.711
ERIC...
WE'RE WAITING.

04:14.879 --> 04:18.423
UM... WELL... AHEM...

04:18.591 --> 04:20.008
I BELIEVE THAT
EVERYONE'S POLITICAL OPINION

04:20.176 --> 04:24.596
IS VALID AND
WORTH HEARING.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.059
WELL, THAT'S...
THAT'S PERFECT, ERIC.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.521
USE THAT LINE WHEN YOU
RUN FOR MISS AMERICA.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.278
SETTLE DOWN
AND WE'LL START THE ASSEMBLY.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.992
NOW, CONCERNING
THE CANNED GOODS DRIVE...

04:45.159 --> 04:48.036
MOTOR OIL IS NOT A FOOD.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.246
BOO!
BOO!

04:49.414 --> 04:51.623
I'M SORRY, IT'S NOT,
AND ALL YOUR BOOING

04:51.791 --> 04:54.334
ISN'T GONNA
MAKE IT ONE.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.129
NOW... AS YOU ALL KNOW,

04:57.297 --> 05:01.341
PRESIDENT FORD WILL
BE VISITING OUR FAIR CITY,

05:01.509 --> 05:04.511
AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME
OF YOU NE'ER-DO-WELLS OUT THERE

05:04.679 --> 05:07.889
THAT MIGHT BE PLANNING
SOME SORT OF QUOTE/UNQUOTE

05:08.057 --> 05:12.561
"SOCIAL
STATEMENT-TYPE PROTEST."

05:12.729 --> 05:13.520
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.064
WHO CARES IF
FORD IS COMING?

05:16.232 --> 05:16.690
IT'S BETTER
THAN WHEN

05:16.858 --> 05:19.735
THE OSCAR MEYER
WEENIE-MOBILE DROVE THROUGH.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.111
THEY DIDN'T
EVEN STOP.

05:21.279 --> 05:21.987
THEY JUST
SLOWED DOWN

05:22.155 --> 05:25.282
AND THREW A BUNCH
OF HOT DOG WHISTLES AT US.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.576
TWO GIRLS
IN A PHALLIC R.V.,

05:27.744 --> 05:31.288
DRIVING AROUND,
HANDING OUT THINGS YOU BLOW...

05:31.456 --> 05:34.291
[SIGHS] WHAT
A GREAT COUNTRY.

05:34.459 --> 05:41.173
SO LET ME TELL YOU
ANOTHER THING, MR. OR MRS. PUNK.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.301
PROTESTING
ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING.

05:48.348 --> 05:52.059
OH, SURE, YOU MIGHT SEE
A CHANCE TO PROVE YOUR MANHOOD

05:52.226 --> 05:55.645
OR SHOW YOU'RE COOL...

05:56.898 --> 06:01.568
BUT THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT.
OUR PRESIDENT, DARN IT!

06:01.736 --> 06:04.279
SO NO SHENANIGANS,
YOU HEAR ME?

06:08.117 --> 06:09.534
IF THAT'S YOUR KIND
OF ATTITUDE,

06:09.702 --> 06:13.038
YOU MIGHT JUST AS WELL
GO HOME RIGHT NOW.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.961
...SO PRESIDENT FORD
SHOULD BE ARRIVING AT NOON.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.880
OH, MAN!
DEVILED EGGS.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.300
ARE... ARE THESE
FOR ANYBODY?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.344
HI, DADDY.
HI, MR. PINCIOTTI.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.261
HI.
HI, KITTEN.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.514
NOW LOOK, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT ADULT STUFF HERE.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.892
WHY DON'T YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
HEAD UP TO YOUR ROOM?

06:40.066 --> 06:42.526
NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF OUR PRESIDENTIAL RALLY

06:42.693 --> 06:44.736
IS THE TOWNSPEOPLE
"Q & A" SECTION.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.530
JUST SO
EVERYONE'S CLEAR,

06:46.697 --> 06:48.323
THE "Q" STANDS
FOR QUESTION.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.493
THE "A" FOR ANSWER.

06:51.661 --> 06:55.497
ALL YOURS, JACK.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.791
THIS IS WHEN NORMAL FOLKS
STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE

06:57.959 --> 06:59.501
AND ASK
THE PRESIDENT QUESTIONS.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.421
NOW, THE IMPORTANT THING IS
TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT PERSON.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.508
YOU KNOW, A WORKING-CLASS GUY,
YOUR AVERAGE JOE.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.845
I GUESS SOMEONE YOU AND I
WOULD CALL A LOSER.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.559
...SO OF COURSE,
I THOUGHT OF YOU.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.770
WE'D LIKE YOU TO ASK
PRESIDENT FORD A QUESTION.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.230
AHHH...

07:21.983 --> 07:24.109
SO, WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO THAT?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.402
I SAY NO, THANK YOU,

07:25.570 --> 07:28.780
AND I WANT MY
CRESCENT WRENCH BACK.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.031
I'LL DO IT.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.743
NO, NO. YOU KEEP WORKING
ON YOUR PIES, HEH HEH.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.126
JUST IMAGINE, RED.
YOU, THE LITTLE GUY,

07:41.294 --> 07:42.335
GET TO HAVE
YOUR OPINIONS HEARD

07:42.503 --> 07:44.421
BY THE MOST
POWERFUL MAN IN AMERICA.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.340
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.

07:50.845 --> 07:51.720
TURN THAT LIGHT OFF!

07:51.888 --> 07:53.722
SORRY.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.434
LOOK, GUYS, WE
GOTTA DO SOMETHING

07:57.602 --> 07:58.852
THAT SAYS WE WILL
NOT PAY HOMAGE

07:59.020 --> 08:01.897
TO A CORRUPT
ELECTORAL SYSTEM.

08:02.064 --> 08:07.027
I KNOW.
A BLOODY COUP!

08:07.195 --> 08:08.653
THAT'S GOOD...

08:08.821 --> 08:10.238
BUT WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING GREAT...

08:10.406 --> 08:12.115
SOMETHING THAT WOULD
MAKE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS

08:12.283 --> 08:15.452
PROUD, MAN, YOU KNOW?

08:18.206 --> 08:19.372
LET'S STREAK!

08:19.540 --> 08:21.541
BINGO!

08:21.709 --> 08:22.542
YEAH! I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO DO THAT.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.795
JUST RUN BUCK NAKED
THROUGH A SEA OF PEOPLE.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.590
BE FREE AND
SHAKE IT AROUND.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.383
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S IN?

08:30.551 --> 08:31.510
WILL PEOPLE
BE CHASING US

08:31.677 --> 08:35.430
WITH TORCHES
AND POINTY STICKS?

08:35.598 --> 08:36.515
NO.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.183
THEN I AM IN.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.434
GREAT!

08:39.602 --> 08:42.646
ERIC... ARE YOU IN?

08:42.813 --> 08:44.105
OK, STREAKING.
I'M...

08:44.273 --> 08:47.025
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M COMPLETELY PRO-NUDITY...

08:47.193 --> 08:48.735
BUT I THINK MY DAD
MIGHT KILL ME,

08:48.903 --> 08:52.405
AND I'M
ANTI-BEING KILLED.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.824
HEY, IF THERE WASN'T
SOME HUGE DOWNSIDE

08:54.992 --> 08:56.618
TO DOING SOMETHING
THIS STUPID,

08:56.786 --> 09:00.330
IT WOULDN'T BE
WORTH DOING, YOU KNOW?

09:00.498 --> 09:02.082
GOOD POINT.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.251
OH! AND I COULD WRITE
SOME REALLY GREAT SLOGAN

09:04.418 --> 09:06.795
LIKE "I HATE THE FUZZ"
ON MY ASS.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.841
IF YOU HATE
THE FUZZ ON YOUR ASS,

09:12.009 --> 09:14.386
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SHAVE IT OFF?

09:29.652 --> 09:32.362
PRETTY SNAZZY, EH?

09:32.530 --> 09:34.573
LOOKING GOOD,

09:36.534 --> 09:38.618
WE'RE GONNA WEAR THEM
TO MEET THE PRESIDENT.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.120

AMERICAN FLAG.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.615
I'M NOT WEARING
A STRIPED JUMPSUIT.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.408

10:34.925 --> 10:37.093
GOOD NEWS, BOB.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,

10:37.261 --> 10:41.139
AND I'VE DECIDED I WILL
ASK FORD A QUESTION.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.809
OH, JEEZ, RED.
THIS IS GOOD NEWS...

10:44.977 --> 10:47.604

GONNA ASK HIM

11:05.748 --> 11:08.667
HOW THE HELL HE'S GONNA
FIX THIS ECONOMY.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.669
OH, HONEY,
HE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.421
HE'S THE PRESIDENT.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.763
ALL THIS FOOD
FOR 45 CENTS.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.099
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.150
OH, I SEE.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.468

12:00.636 --> 12:02.137

12:54.190 --> 12:56.691
IT'S YOUR QUESTION

I CAN ASK THE PRESIDENT
ANY DAMN THING I WANT.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.256
IT'S MY RIGHT.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.092

13:28.182 --> 13:36.648
NO. ERIC, A MAN HAS

13:42.571 --> 13:46.658
THEY TOOK MY JOB...
MY STABILITY...

13:46.826 --> 13:50.912
AND NOW THEY WANNA TAKE AWAY
MY RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.163
YOU STILL HAVE
THE TOYOTA.

13:52.331 --> 13:56.459
IT GETS
GREAT MILEAGE.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.879
WHERE'S THE AMERICA

14:40.671 --> 14:41.880
FEZ, HOW'D YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT?

14:42.047 --> 14:45.383
MY COUNTRY INVENTED
"NOT IT."

14:45.551 --> 14:46.676
SO, CAN WE GO ALREADY?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.929
I'M ITCHIN' TO RELEASE

OH, WELL,

BYE.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.818
AREN'T YOU GOING, DONNA?

15:03.986 --> 15:06.112

15:06.280 --> 15:08.239
THIS REALLY QUEER
JUMPSUIT.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.532
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO IT.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.243
IT'S JUST
TOO EMBARRASSING.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.037
YOU KNOW, DONNA,

15:14.204 --> 15:16.706
MY GRANDMOTHER
CAME FROM SWEDEN,

15:16.874 --> 15:19.042
AND SHE HAD THIS
THICK, THICK ACCENT,

15:19.209 --> 15:21.085
AND IT EMBARRASSED ME
TO NO END.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.964
WELL, I ASKED HER NOT TO COME
TO MY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

15:25.132 --> 15:27.759
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
MY FRIENDS TO HEAR HER TALK,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.594
AND SHE DIDN'T COME.

15:29.762 --> 15:35.058
SIXTEEN YEARS LATER,
SHE GOT THE GOUT AND DIED.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.310
YOU SEE?

15:37.478 --> 15:38.811
NO.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.813
ALL FAMILIES
ARE EMBARRASSING.

15:40.981 --> 15:45.318
AND IF THEY'RE NOT EMBARRASSING,
THEN THEY'RE DEAD.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.659
ALL RIGHT,
TRY AND BLEND IN, HUH?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.161

16:32.741 --> 16:35.827
IT'LL LOOK LIKE THE FLAG
