WEBVTT

00:56.078 --> 00:59.012
This is Captain Trevor
at coordinate 509.

00:59.014 --> 01:02.015
We're tracking several UFOs
and they're moving fast.

01:02.017 --> 01:03.917
What the hell?

01:03.919 --> 01:06.053
Lieutenant, are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

01:06.055 --> 01:08.690
<i>Copy that.
Sir, we've got incoming.</i>

01:08.692 --> 01:10.660
<i>They're right on top of...</i>

02:33.410 --> 02:35.708
Am I... Am I dead?

02:35.710 --> 02:37.213
Of course not.

02:38.847 --> 02:41.449
This looks like heaven.

02:41.451 --> 02:44.821
And you're an angel.

02:45.988 --> 02:48.455
You're still light-headed
from your injuries.

02:48.457 --> 02:49.826
I'm Diana.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.427
Diana...

02:52.429 --> 02:53.627
Oh, shit.

02:53.629 --> 02:56.600
Calm down.
You're going to be fine.

02:59.969 --> 03:02.503
You're safe here
on Themyscira.

03:02.505 --> 03:03.570
Thema-what?

03:03.572 --> 03:04.538
Themyscira.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.439
Home to the Amazons.

03:06.441 --> 03:08.409
A paradise favored by the gods,

03:08.411 --> 03:11.278
hidden for centuries
from the gaze of man's world.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.248
Ruled by my mother,
Queen Hippolyta.

03:14.250 --> 03:18.087
So that means
you're a princess, right?

03:18.787 --> 03:20.189
Something like that.

03:21.156 --> 03:22.925
Saved by a princess?

03:23.593 --> 03:25.325
Is there a problem?

03:25.327 --> 03:27.594
Nope. I like a little drama.

03:27.596 --> 03:29.698
Then that makes two of us.

03:32.869 --> 03:35.736
There, it's all healed.

03:35.738 --> 03:37.504
Wow. What is this thing?

03:37.506 --> 03:39.339
The purple healing ray.

03:39.341 --> 03:41.143
Yeah, but what is it called?

03:41.977 --> 03:44.278
The purple healing ray.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.849
Oh, really? Okay.

03:46.982 --> 03:49.016
Look, thanks
for the save, Princess,

03:49.018 --> 03:50.583
but I've got
to get out of here.

03:50.585 --> 03:54.121
Some kind of alien...
Demons are invading the Earth.

03:54.123 --> 03:55.889
I saw the battle.

03:55.891 --> 03:58.926
You continued to attack
against hopeless odds.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.861
Yeah, that's the job.

04:00.863 --> 04:04.030
Look, nobody knows about these
creatures and I've got to warn them.

04:04.032 --> 04:06.234
You have to understand,
Captain Trevor.

04:06.236 --> 04:08.935
You are the first man,
the first outsider,

04:08.937 --> 04:12.272
to ever set foot on Themyscira.

04:12.274 --> 04:14.040
You will be held
in the cells of justice

04:14.042 --> 04:17.077
until my mother and the senate
can decide your fate.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.212
Jail? You're going
to put me in jail?

04:19.214 --> 04:21.214
I haven't done anything.

04:21.216 --> 04:23.383
No, no, no, you can't.
I need to get back.

04:23.385 --> 04:24.952
I have to warn them.

04:24.954 --> 04:27.656
Those monsters could be
invading Earth right now.

04:28.325 --> 04:29.757
Diana!

04:29.759 --> 04:32.596
Diana, somebody's
got to do something.

04:44.173 --> 04:47.140
You ever think about opening
a resort business?

04:47.142 --> 04:49.443
'Cause I've got
a friend named Etta

04:49.445 --> 04:53.815
who'd give her right arm for an island
full of beautiful female bodybuilders.

04:53.817 --> 04:57.654
I think my mother has proven
hospitality is not her priority.

05:02.957 --> 05:05.558
Princess, what brings you here?

05:05.560 --> 05:06.863
Unfortunately, this.

05:10.765 --> 05:12.334
Forgive me, sister.

05:13.668 --> 05:15.969
I take it deliberations
are over.

05:15.971 --> 05:17.740
It did not go well.

05:23.178 --> 05:28.416
Steven Trevor of man's world,
I am here to take you home.

05:28.418 --> 05:32.922
Um, thanks, angel,
but shouldn't we be headed that way?

05:39.327 --> 05:41.395
Not if we're escaping.

05:41.397 --> 05:43.332
Well, when you
put it like that...

05:57.913 --> 05:59.613
Once we get to the boat,

05:59.615 --> 06:02.252
I can take you across the
barrier and back to your people.

06:03.586 --> 06:05.986
Diana.

06:05.988 --> 06:08.289
Your mom is not going
to be happy about this.

06:08.291 --> 06:11.558
Point me toward the boat
and I can take it from here.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.464
I saw the demon that killed your
friends and destroyed your craft.

06:16.865 --> 06:19.233
You need my help.

06:19.235 --> 06:21.133
The gods foretold of this day,

06:21.135 --> 06:23.537
when a champion from Themyscira
would be called upon

06:23.539 --> 06:26.673
to protect man's world
from untold horrors.

06:26.675 --> 06:30.044
My mother taught me that
an Amazon does what is right,

06:30.046 --> 06:32.212
no matter the cost.

06:32.214 --> 06:33.948
So that's what I intend to do.

06:33.950 --> 06:35.284
Diana.

06:42.692 --> 06:45.226
Explain yourself.

06:45.228 --> 06:47.460
Do not try to stop me, Mother.

06:47.462 --> 06:49.363
I am your queen.

06:49.365 --> 06:52.933
Which is why you will return that
sacred armor to its rightful place.

06:52.935 --> 06:55.601
You will return that prisoner
to his cell.

06:55.603 --> 06:58.337
You will thank me for my mercy.

06:58.339 --> 07:00.844
And we will never
discuss this again.

07:06.014 --> 07:07.847
His name is Steven.

07:07.849 --> 07:09.717
I have sworn to return him
to his people

07:09.719 --> 07:12.152
and I intend to go with him.

07:12.154 --> 07:14.320
If you wish to steal
from the Amazons,

07:14.322 --> 07:17.123
you will have to go
through their protector.

07:17.125 --> 07:19.325
Is that what you want?

07:19.327 --> 07:20.861
No.

07:20.863 --> 07:22.832
It's what you taught me.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.135
So be it.

07:29.872 --> 07:31.837
His arrival is a sign.

07:38.947 --> 07:41.181
Man's world needs our help.

07:41.183 --> 07:43.616
Man's world is past help.

07:46.923 --> 07:49.125
That is not
your choice to make.

08:03.572 --> 08:07.140
If you leave,
you will never become queen.

08:07.142 --> 08:09.476
You will never set foot
on this island again.

08:09.478 --> 08:13.013
Are you truly willing to
throw away everything you are

08:13.015 --> 08:15.551
for the mere chance
of helping them?

08:27.762 --> 08:29.498
Ask me again, Mother.

08:35.203 --> 08:38.938
It's strange that you should
be my own daughter,

08:38.940 --> 08:42.344
and yet someone I do not
recognize anymore.

09:17.378 --> 09:19.349
The edge of Themyscira.

09:20.483 --> 09:21.981
Once we cross,

09:21.983 --> 09:23.887
we will never
be able to return.

09:25.555 --> 09:27.190
I will be alone.

09:28.022 --> 09:29.590
No, Diana, you won't.

09:29.592 --> 09:31.060
We're in this together.

09:31.694 --> 09:33.096
All right?

10:17.906 --> 10:19.573
Etta Candy.

10:19.575 --> 10:22.608
Are you sure Dr. Kapatelis
is okay with this?

10:22.610 --> 10:26.713
Diana, Julia Kapatelis is an
expert on ancient cultures,

10:26.715 --> 10:28.381
and you're an ancient culture.

10:28.383 --> 10:30.350
Walking around in great shoes.

10:30.352 --> 10:31.952
Having you stay at her place?

10:31.954 --> 10:34.690
I thought I was gonna have
to scrape her off the floor.

10:36.057 --> 10:38.125
Uh, that's a good thing.

10:38.127 --> 10:40.360
Which is exactly
why we're doing this.

10:40.362 --> 10:41.962
They'll love you, Di.

10:41.964 --> 10:43.398
You just gotta relax.

10:54.075 --> 10:56.610
Okay, vacuumed the rug,
kitchen's clean,

10:56.612 --> 10:58.211
toilet's scrubbed, twice.

10:58.213 --> 11:01.048
Why don't I hear sweeping?

11:01.050 --> 11:04.651
Because if I sweep any more,
my arms are gonna fall off.

11:04.653 --> 11:07.222
It's not like
she's gonna lick the floor.

11:08.224 --> 11:10.258
Vanessa Kapatelis, an actual,

11:11.324 --> 11:12.259
literal princess
is coming here.

11:12.261 --> 11:14.794
That means no slouching,
no open-mouth chewing,

11:14.796 --> 11:18.531
and if your arms fall off,
it is a small price to pay.

11:18.533 --> 11:21.336
Oh, my God, did I check the
expiration date on the potpourri?

11:31.747 --> 11:32.748
Oh.

11:34.650 --> 11:35.752
A princess.

11:37.618 --> 11:39.352
Wow.

11:39.354 --> 11:41.856
Yes, but you should
call me Vanessa.

11:41.858 --> 11:43.323
I mean, "Diana."

11:43.325 --> 11:44.761
You're Vanessa, obviously.

11:45.494 --> 11:46.495
Right?

11:50.932 --> 11:53.000
Are you cleansing your house?

11:53.002 --> 11:54.068
Here, let me help.

11:54.070 --> 11:55.168
You really don't have to...

11:55.170 --> 11:56.705
Vanessa, was that the doorbell?

11:59.807 --> 12:01.640
No slouching.

12:01.642 --> 12:03.076
Princess Diana,

12:03.078 --> 12:04.680
welcome to our home.

12:07.349 --> 12:09.786
It is an honor to meet you
as well, Dr. Kapatelis.

12:10.585 --> 12:12.419
Both of you.

12:12.421 --> 12:16.990
Um, why don't I show you
the rest of the house?

12:16.992 --> 12:18.391
I've rearranged the rooms.

12:18.393 --> 12:20.827
Yours gets lovely sunlight
in the morning.

12:20.829 --> 12:22.330
This is so exciting.

12:23.364 --> 12:25.231
I know how you feel.

12:25.233 --> 12:26.768
I have a strong mother, too.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.473
I have so much
to teach you,

12:34.475 --> 12:37.245
and so much to learn
from you, of course.

12:38.113 --> 12:39.714
Do you like potpourri?

12:54.930 --> 12:57.063
Do you mind if I am also here?

12:57.065 --> 12:58.633
Sure. Why not?

13:00.301 --> 13:01.802
Your sleeping chamber
is like my room

13:01.804 --> 13:04.071
in the royal palace
on Themyscira,

13:04.073 --> 13:05.270
albeit a bit smaller

13:05.272 --> 13:07.576
and without handmaidens,
of course.

13:14.849 --> 13:17.586
I'm sorry I put you
in trouble yesterday.

13:18.719 --> 13:19.752
It's okay.

13:19.754 --> 13:22.188
You're like a big,
huge deal to Mom.

13:22.190 --> 13:24.560
"Living history" and all that.

13:25.193 --> 13:27.260
Do you miss it?

13:27.262 --> 13:28.631
Your home?

13:29.599 --> 13:30.996
A bit.

13:30.998 --> 13:34.500
But I came here to make
your world a better place.

13:34.502 --> 13:37.172
And once your mother teaches me
more about your culture,

13:37.873 --> 13:39.242
that's what I'll do.

13:40.474 --> 13:42.744
Can you just decide that?

13:44.112 --> 13:46.779
To make the whole world better?

13:46.781 --> 13:50.417
Everyone gets to decide what
they want to do with their life.

13:50.419 --> 13:52.217
I might not succeed,

13:52.219 --> 13:54.422
but this is what
I choose to try.

13:58.694 --> 14:02.395
But not everyone has
to choose the same thing.

14:02.397 --> 14:03.764
What about you, Vanessa?

14:03.766 --> 14:05.834
What will you dedicate
your life to?

14:07.737 --> 14:10.803
I don't know,
killing teenage vampires?

14:10.805 --> 14:12.438
Don't worry.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.674
Vampires aren't real.

14:14.676 --> 14:15.844
I wasn't worried.

14:16.679 --> 14:17.847
And they are.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.951
But it doesn't matter
what I want.

14:24.953 --> 14:26.486
My mom's an archeologist.

14:26.488 --> 14:28.255
Her dad was an archeologist.

14:28.257 --> 14:30.189
Blah, blah, blah.

14:30.191 --> 14:31.893
What if you could choose?

14:33.695 --> 14:35.361
I don't know.

14:35.363 --> 14:37.231
I like my martial arts class.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.865
I like math.

14:38.867 --> 14:42.202
I used to play the drums
until the neighbors complained.

14:43.839 --> 14:47.276
I guess...
I want to be something else.

14:48.776 --> 14:49.978
Anything else.

14:52.046 --> 14:53.449
Have you told your mother?

14:54.550 --> 14:56.381
Told me what?

14:56.383 --> 14:59.654
That I've suddenly allowed people
to put their shoes on the bed?

15:03.157 --> 15:04.356
Don't worry, Diana.

15:04.358 --> 15:06.961
You're our guest.

15:06.963 --> 15:09.565
Come on, Vanessa,
time to set the table.

16:32.414 --> 16:34.280
Are you sitting down?

16:34.282 --> 16:35.483
Yeah.

16:37.252 --> 16:39.821
I mean, yes.
We're sitting.

16:40.555 --> 16:42.521
Just show them, Di.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.493
She's really excited.

16:53.669 --> 16:55.504
What do you think?

16:56.539 --> 16:58.337
Um, it's...

16:58.339 --> 17:00.140
Totally embarrassing?

17:00.142 --> 17:01.140
Vanessa.

17:01.142 --> 17:02.708
Come on, Mom.

17:02.710 --> 17:05.010
What's she gonna be,
a superhero?

17:05.012 --> 17:06.915
You can't even drive yet.

17:10.084 --> 17:11.784
Diana, what's going on?

17:11.786 --> 17:14.757
Are you trying to be
like that nut in Gotham?

17:15.356 --> 17:17.290
It is why I came.

17:17.292 --> 17:19.959
To help protect man's world.

17:19.961 --> 17:22.628
There's more than one way
to be a hero.

17:22.631 --> 17:24.698
My employer, Dr. Cale,
has set up an amazing...

17:24.700 --> 17:27.300
We're not asking
for your permission, Julia.

17:27.301 --> 17:29.136
Diana's already
taking missions.

17:29.138 --> 17:31.137
There's talk of her meeting
the president.

17:31.139 --> 17:33.773
The press has already
given her a code name.

17:33.775 --> 17:37.110
Julia, I'm sure I could
help many by joining you.

17:37.112 --> 17:39.748
But this is the right way
to help for me.

17:41.783 --> 17:44.184
Then that's what you should do.

17:44.186 --> 17:45.651
What?

17:45.653 --> 17:47.320
Thank you, sisters.

17:47.322 --> 17:49.158
I'll make you proud.

17:49.825 --> 17:50.959
Whatever.

17:52.126 --> 17:55.498
So, what's your code name?

18:18.586 --> 18:20.890
It's Wonder Woman.
Blast her.

18:22.391 --> 18:24.424
<i>Hey, Di? Di?</i>

18:24.426 --> 18:26.493
<i>Whoever you're punching
in the face right now,</i>

18:26.495 --> 18:27.726
<i>can you do it a little faster?</i>

18:27.728 --> 18:30.095
<i>I need you at the Hall.</i>

18:30.097 --> 18:32.198
I always forget
how funny you are.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.899
<i>I forgive you.</i>

18:33.901 --> 18:35.601
<i>But only because most Amazons
wouldn't know a sense of humor</i>

18:35.603 --> 18:37.070
if it bit their noses off.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.272
I'm an Amazon.

18:38.274 --> 18:39.938
<i>And you just proved my point.</i>

18:39.940 --> 18:41.807
Back off,
Wonder Woman.

18:41.809 --> 18:42.708
Hang on.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.212
I swear I'll blow her head off.

18:50.219 --> 18:52.886
Those are not
the only two outcomes.

18:58.492 --> 19:00.028
I believe this is yours.

19:00.662 --> 19:02.964
Um, thanks?

19:04.632 --> 19:05.899
No problem.

19:05.901 --> 19:07.969
I'm sorry these men
hampered your day.

19:11.774 --> 19:14.640
"Hampered your day?"

19:14.642 --> 19:18.710
Exactly how long is it gonna be before
you stop talking like my grandma?

19:18.712 --> 19:20.248
Don't be silly.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.053
I'm much older
than your grandmother.

19:25.187 --> 19:27.286
You really
are something special,

19:27.288 --> 19:28.490
you know that?

19:30.558 --> 19:31.626
What is it?

19:32.759 --> 19:34.393
Nothing, it's just...

19:34.395 --> 19:36.595
I used to pride myself on that,

19:36.597 --> 19:37.832
being unique.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.971
I hadn't realized it's not
always a good thing.

19:44.639 --> 19:48.007
It's always a good thing
to the right people.

19:48.009 --> 19:49.676
Speaking of the right people,

19:49.678 --> 19:52.147
a blast from our past
just walked in.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.285
Julia?

19:59.453 --> 20:01.289
It's been too long.

20:08.697 --> 20:09.899
What is it?

20:10.598 --> 20:12.032
It's Vanessa.

20:12.034 --> 20:14.803
I think she's in trouble,
and we need your help.

20:18.773 --> 20:21.506
I found some disturbing e-mails
in her office.

20:21.508 --> 20:22.976
If Dr. Cale read these...

20:22.978 --> 20:25.644
Veronica Cale?
The pharmaceutical magnate?

20:25.646 --> 20:28.214
What does a drug company
want with archeologists?

20:28.216 --> 20:32.251
Innovation isn't nearly as linear
as many people think, Etta.

20:32.253 --> 20:35.153
Our work at Cale
Pharmaceuticals is valuable.

20:35.155 --> 20:39.859
But I fear that it hasn't been
profitable enough for my daughter.

20:39.861 --> 20:44.096
Vanessa's planning to sell one
of Cale's artifacts to someone else.

20:44.098 --> 20:46.865
If anyone finds out,
she'll go to prison.

20:46.867 --> 20:49.201
I don't even know her anymore.

20:49.203 --> 20:51.071
Help me, Diana.

20:51.073 --> 20:53.242
Help me get my daughter back.

20:59.515 --> 21:01.413
Hello?

21:01.415 --> 21:02.750
Is anyone here?

21:03.719 --> 21:05.019
Hello?

21:08.690 --> 21:10.625
Answer me, damn it!

21:11.793 --> 21:13.626
So presumptuous.

21:13.628 --> 21:18.867
It's been a long time since anyone
spoke to Dr. Poison that way.

21:20.267 --> 21:21.370
Poison?

21:22.437 --> 21:24.871
Which one of you is Dr. Cyber?

21:24.873 --> 21:27.607
She's the one
I negotiated with.

21:27.609 --> 21:30.376
Cyber doesn't do
anything face-to-face.

21:30.378 --> 21:33.345
It's one of the reasons
she teamed up with me.

21:33.347 --> 21:36.748
<i>Rest assured,
she's keeping an eye out for us.</i>

21:36.750 --> 21:38.152
<i>Do you have the item?</i>

21:39.153 --> 21:40.852
I want my money.

21:40.854 --> 21:43.291
I need to make sure
it's viable first.

21:49.130 --> 21:52.198
<i>Poison,
you've got a super incoming.</i>

21:52.200 --> 21:54.135
<i>They're headed
straight for you.</i>

21:55.769 --> 21:58.470
You double-crossed us.
Kill her!

22:06.748 --> 22:08.447
Vanessa.

22:08.449 --> 22:11.420
<i>Nein.</i>
You'll damage the artifact.

22:13.389 --> 22:15.188
Diana?

22:15.190 --> 22:17.224
I'm not here for you, Poison.

22:17.226 --> 22:18.992
Vanessa.

22:18.994 --> 22:21.159
That case belongs
to Veronica Cale.

22:21.161 --> 22:23.229
This isn't
any of your business.

22:23.231 --> 22:25.232
You don't even know
what's going on.

22:25.234 --> 22:28.534
<i>Poison, I'd get
out of there if I were you.</i>

22:28.536 --> 22:31.707
Kill the agents.
Take the hero.

22:36.710 --> 22:38.778
Time for a rematch,
Wonder Wench.

22:47.287 --> 22:48.821
Giganta.

22:48.823 --> 22:51.123
Bigger and better, bitch.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.795
Get down.

23:02.871 --> 23:04.305
Stay here.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.035
I've secured the artifact.

23:41.242 --> 23:43.911
Now that, I will not allow.

24:09.069 --> 24:11.371
How does your saying go?

24:11.373 --> 24:14.876
"The bigger they are,
the more they fall down?"

24:17.112 --> 24:18.011
Yes.

24:18.013 --> 24:19.481
That's it exactly.

24:31.626 --> 24:34.896
I think we can all agree you've
made some poor life choices.

24:37.398 --> 24:39.064
Perhaps some time
in prison will...

24:39.066 --> 24:40.301
No!

24:43.471 --> 24:45.572
Mom. Mom.

24:45.574 --> 24:46.906
I'm here.

24:51.046 --> 24:54.082
Di, Diana...

25:08.729 --> 25:10.399
She shouldn't have been here.

25:11.266 --> 25:13.435
You shouldn't have been here.

25:15.536 --> 25:17.703
She's dead.

25:17.705 --> 25:20.275
And it's all your fault.

25:25.613 --> 25:27.548
Don't touch me.

25:29.950 --> 25:32.517
Vanessa. Vanessa!

25:32.519 --> 25:34.088
Di? Di.

25:35.356 --> 25:36.524
Oh, no.

25:58.979 --> 26:01.048
I thought Vanessa
would be here.

26:02.417 --> 26:03.716
I...

26:03.718 --> 26:06.218
I'd hoped to apologize.

26:06.220 --> 26:09.088
You don't have anything
to apologize for, angel.

26:09.090 --> 26:10.990
You didn't shoot Julia.

26:10.992 --> 26:12.992
She didn't get hit
by a ricochet either,

26:12.994 --> 26:14.726
the angles were all wrong.

26:14.728 --> 26:16.963
I checked a dozen times.

26:16.965 --> 26:19.034
I should have been
able to save her.

26:20.167 --> 26:22.371
A true Amazon would have.

26:22.937 --> 26:24.238
I...

26:25.106 --> 26:27.541
I've failed two mothers now.

26:31.712 --> 26:34.048
I've cost Vanessa everything.

26:35.182 --> 26:37.949
Then we'll make it right,
as much as we can.

26:37.951 --> 26:40.388
We're in this
together, remember?

26:58.073 --> 26:59.805
<i>Disgusting.</i>

26:59.807 --> 27:01.642
<i>I detest cheap sentiment.</i>

27:02.811 --> 27:04.279
It's not fair.

27:05.212 --> 27:06.714
Is it, Vanessa?

27:13.354 --> 27:14.389
I'm in.

27:15.891 --> 27:18.324
All the way.

28:58.793 --> 29:01.226
We have a
delivery for the doctors.

29:01.228 --> 29:02.695
Step aside, girl.

29:02.697 --> 29:06.799
You're standing between me
and a lot of money.

29:06.801 --> 29:10.936
Dr. Poison and Cyber instructed
me to accept your delivery.

29:10.938 --> 29:12.971
As for your payment,

29:12.973 --> 29:14.608
I wouldn't worry about it.

29:20.681 --> 29:23.882
What are you?

29:23.884 --> 29:25.184
More than I was,

29:25.186 --> 29:27.620
and not as much as I will be.

29:44.205 --> 29:47.272
You wreck any more robots and
we're gonna have an uprising.

29:48.476 --> 29:50.376
I'm trying to train.

29:50.378 --> 29:52.714
I know what you're
trying to do, Di.

29:53.981 --> 29:55.680
We found her.

29:55.682 --> 29:59.184
Vanessa popped up on a spy
satellite on the Qurac border.

29:59.186 --> 30:02.521
She's smuggling medical
equipment, tech, and artifacts.

30:02.523 --> 30:06.225
All linked to Dr. Cyber
and Dr. Poison.

30:06.227 --> 30:08.593
I guess she didn't
learn her lesson.

30:08.595 --> 30:11.197
Or we didn't leave
her any options.

30:11.199 --> 30:14.300
She's young,
thinks she's alone.

30:14.302 --> 30:17.070
We need to show her
that's not true.

30:17.072 --> 30:18.469
Thought you might say that.

30:18.471 --> 30:20.438
Etta, can you get us transport?

30:20.440 --> 30:23.342
Something discreet?

30:23.344 --> 30:25.346
I know just the thing.

30:46.433 --> 30:51.603
Etta, did you steal an invisible
jet from the US military?

30:51.605 --> 30:53.706
<i>Steven Trevor,
I'm surprised at you.</i>

30:53.708 --> 30:56.577
<i>There's no such thing
as an invisible jet.</i>

31:02.883 --> 31:06.587
I gotta admit, it feels good to
get away from the desk for a while.

31:07.421 --> 31:09.591
Oh, I love flying.

31:10.592 --> 31:13.592
You never flew with me.

31:13.594 --> 31:16.562
Yeah, well,
you were flying with Superman.

31:16.564 --> 31:18.266
And three's a crowd.

31:20.301 --> 31:22.470
I'm not flying
with Superman now.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.014
We've got enough fuel to hover
for about an hour.

31:35.016 --> 31:36.114
Let's rock and roll.

31:36.116 --> 31:37.315
Are you worried?

31:37.317 --> 31:39.351
Yeah, that's why
I'm not dead yet.

31:43.958 --> 31:45.427
Ladies first?

32:04.845 --> 32:06.778
You can't open it?

32:06.780 --> 32:09.416
I can, it's just gonna
be the hard way.

32:22.930 --> 32:24.796
Yeah see? Hard way.

32:24.798 --> 32:27.401
<i>Oh, you have no idea.</i>

32:42.116 --> 32:45.083
<i>Poison, inner walls
are breached.</i>

32:45.085 --> 32:46.787
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock.</i>

32:49.090 --> 32:51.489
You have to give
us time to get in the air.

32:51.491 --> 32:54.559
If we lose it, we'll never be
able to execute the mission.

32:54.561 --> 32:56.595
I'll do it.

32:56.597 --> 32:59.497
I can handle whoever's
storming the gates.

32:59.499 --> 33:04.003
I knew you were a
fighter that night in the warehouse.

33:04.005 --> 33:07.676
Show me how much more
you've become since then.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.516
<i>She's not ready, Poison.</i>

33:15.850 --> 33:17.719
<i>Not without all the upgrades.</i>

33:18.486 --> 33:20.953
No, but she is expendable.

33:20.955 --> 33:24.025
The prototype,
our mission, is not.

33:41.409 --> 33:42.874
Vanessa?

33:42.876 --> 33:44.345
Vanessa's dead.

33:48.582 --> 33:50.349
It's Silver Swan now.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.057
Why?

33:59.059 --> 34:01.127
Why did you let them
do this to you?

34:01.129 --> 34:03.562
You were always so perfect.

34:03.564 --> 34:05.400
Well, I'm perfect now.

34:16.176 --> 34:18.676
Cyber and Poison saw to that.

34:18.678 --> 34:22.348
They are not your friends.

34:22.350 --> 34:23.982
Of course, they are.

34:23.984 --> 34:25.786
They helped me kill you.

34:43.603 --> 34:44.969
Is she all right?

34:44.971 --> 34:47.440
Looks like she just
got her bell rung a bit.

34:47.442 --> 34:50.342
But what now?
Do we call the League?

34:50.344 --> 34:53.011
No. Vanessa's not
in her right mind.

34:53.013 --> 34:57.750
The mutilation she's endured
is proof enough of that.

34:57.752 --> 35:00.889
We need someone whose
only concern is helping her.

35:02.323 --> 35:03.823
Etta.

35:03.825 --> 35:06.292
<i>We need someone
with expertise in bio-tech,</i>

35:06.294 --> 35:07.759
<i>high-security facilities,</i>

35:07.761 --> 35:10.031
<i>and the ability
to keep their mouth shut.</i>

35:11.931 --> 35:14.634
Hmm, speak of the devil.

35:14.636 --> 35:16.771
How 'bout two out of three?

35:19.040 --> 35:21.806
The Wonder Woman herself.

35:21.808 --> 35:23.609
I'm gonna be real honest.

35:23.611 --> 35:26.679
When Etta called me, I laughed.

35:26.681 --> 35:29.415
Never dreamed someone
as illustrious as yourself

35:29.417 --> 35:31.616
would grace my door.

35:31.618 --> 35:34.756
Let alone with my own
ex-employee in your arms.

35:35.989 --> 35:37.355
Veronica Cale.

35:37.357 --> 35:38.989
The name's out front.

35:38.991 --> 35:41.527
A pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Cale.

35:41.529 --> 35:43.228
Do you know what's wrong
with Vanessa?

35:43.230 --> 35:47.333
The issue is these implants
aren't really implanted at all.

35:47.335 --> 35:50.268
They're the expression
of a techno-organic virus.

35:50.270 --> 35:55.272
Vanessa didn't have this Silver
Swan-thing grafted onto her.

35:55.274 --> 35:58.076
She's being turned into it
from the inside out

35:58.078 --> 36:00.045
and it's still going on.

36:00.047 --> 36:01.880
The worst part is,

36:01.882 --> 36:04.085
I can't find any off switch.

36:06.085 --> 36:08.353
This virus will keep
replacing her

36:08.355 --> 36:10.024
until there's nothing left.

36:11.326 --> 36:13.194
Killing her in the process.

36:14.328 --> 36:16.027
In theory, I could heal her,

36:16.029 --> 36:19.901
but she doesn't have the time,
and I don't have the tech.

36:21.201 --> 36:23.004
Themyscira does.

36:23.837 --> 36:25.638
The purple healing ray.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.373
Well,
if it's so easy,

36:28.375 --> 36:29.808
why'd you need to come here?

36:29.810 --> 36:32.812
You out of free miles
on your rewards card?

36:32.814 --> 36:35.580
I don't know
where Themyscira is.

36:35.582 --> 36:37.250
It's a security measure.

36:37.252 --> 36:40.219
As soon as anyone leaves the
island, they forget its location.

36:40.221 --> 36:41.853
Even Diana.

36:41.855 --> 36:43.958
But you're
going to find it again?

36:45.326 --> 36:46.661
For Vanessa,

36:49.196 --> 36:50.995
I have to.

36:50.997 --> 36:54.732
Well, if you promise to
bring me back something nice,

36:54.734 --> 36:56.902
I know exactly
where you can start.

37:05.379 --> 37:07.915
This was Julia's office.

37:08.783 --> 37:10.415
Such as it is.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.851
She always talked
about Themyscira.

37:12.853 --> 37:15.689
Finding it was her
personal pet project.

37:16.489 --> 37:17.825
Good luck.

37:33.674 --> 37:35.741
I've been in intelligence
for nearly a decade,

37:35.743 --> 37:38.009
and even I can't
navigate this mess.

37:38.011 --> 37:39.743
Some of this stuff is amazing.

37:39.745 --> 37:41.746
The tomb of Persises?

37:41.748 --> 37:44.650
Perseus. He slew Medusa.

37:44.652 --> 37:46.717
There are notes in here
about Medusa cells

37:46.719 --> 37:48.020
being used in treatment.

37:48.022 --> 37:50.422
I didn't even know
she was real.

37:50.424 --> 37:53.725
You didn't think I was real
the first time we met.

37:53.727 --> 37:56.163
Uh, I was concussed.

37:59.767 --> 38:01.900
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

38:01.902 --> 38:05.203
Cale said finding Themyscira
was Julia's pet project,

38:05.205 --> 38:07.906
but Julia knew about the island
before she met Cale.

38:07.908 --> 38:10.509
So her notes won't be
on the top of the piles...

38:10.511 --> 38:11.980
They'd be on the bottom.

38:21.922 --> 38:25.290
Here. The temple of Pasiphae.

38:25.292 --> 38:26.926
Ah, Pasiphae.

38:26.928 --> 38:31.096
Famed goddess of...
Pacifiers?

38:31.098 --> 38:34.665
She's an oracular goddess
associated with mazes.

38:34.667 --> 38:37.034
She helps people
see the future.

38:37.036 --> 38:40.638
If her shrine is still intact,
it could point the way to Themyscira.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.909
Then what the hell
are we waiting for?

38:48.015 --> 38:50.616
Okay. This is a mistake.

38:50.618 --> 38:53.152
I have a really nice office,
you know.

38:53.154 --> 38:54.353
Leather chair.

38:54.355 --> 38:56.187
That fancy espresso machine
in the lounge.

38:56.189 --> 38:57.422
And where am I?

38:57.424 --> 38:59.790
Flying to some god-forsaken
no-woman's land

38:59.792 --> 39:02.261
to ruin my boots.

39:02.263 --> 39:05.364
Etta, you asked
to come on this mission.

39:05.366 --> 39:07.266
Of course, I did.

39:07.268 --> 39:09.567
If you think I'm gonna pass up the
chance to find a drinking fountain

39:09.569 --> 39:10.835
that can tell the future,

39:10.837 --> 39:12.939
your tiara's on too tight.

39:43.837 --> 39:45.703
Now that is impressive.

39:45.705 --> 39:48.406
How do you even get
to a place like this on foot?

39:48.408 --> 39:50.044
Not quickly.

39:52.279 --> 39:53.444
Cheetah.

39:53.446 --> 39:55.716
What in the name of Hera
are you doing here?

40:04.123 --> 40:06.026
Into the temple. Now.

40:07.294 --> 40:09.560
This is why
I don't like field work.

40:09.562 --> 40:11.029
First lesson in the field.

40:11.031 --> 40:13.732
Sometimes you've just
gotta focus on running.

40:13.734 --> 40:15.801
Don't get cocky.

40:15.803 --> 40:17.601
You may have
saved your friends,

40:17.603 --> 40:19.437
but you're my real target.

40:32.986 --> 40:37.190
I was really hoping the whole
maze thing was just a metaphor.

40:45.466 --> 40:46.834
You've improved.

40:47.935 --> 40:49.634
But you haven't beaten me yet.

40:55.810 --> 40:58.944
And you won't now.

40:58.946 --> 41:01.212
That's where
you're wrong, Princess.

41:01.214 --> 41:05.951
Poison and Cyber have formed a regular
Villains Incorporated to take you down.

41:05.953 --> 41:07.853
And they mean business.

41:07.855 --> 41:11.890
Giving stock options to anyone
willing to join their little start up.

41:11.892 --> 41:14.158
Including me.

41:46.093 --> 41:48.625
Steve, does any
of this bother you?

41:48.627 --> 41:49.795
Uh, you mean the dirt?

41:49.797 --> 41:52.063
No, that's just a you thing.

41:52.065 --> 41:54.232
No. I mean Pasiphae, mazes.

41:54.234 --> 41:56.033
Something about this
is familiar.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.470
Get back.

42:00.808 --> 42:04.011
Must stop intruders.

42:04.777 --> 42:08.850
Must stop intruders!

42:09.382 --> 42:10.482
That's it.

42:10.484 --> 42:12.484
Pasiphae gave birth
to the Minotaur.

42:12.486 --> 42:13.986
The beast of the maze.

42:16.390 --> 42:18.526
You couldn't
remember that sooner?

42:24.598 --> 42:27.199
Listen, tri-tip,
we don't want any trouble.

42:27.201 --> 42:31.005
Must stop intruders.

42:42.082 --> 42:44.352
How're we gonna get there
before he does?

42:48.321 --> 42:49.356
We're not.

42:52.493 --> 42:54.393
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hey!

42:54.395 --> 42:56.795
- Bully, bully, over here.
- Hey, over here.

42:56.797 --> 42:57.828
Hey, over here.

42:57.830 --> 42:59.200
Don't kill me.

43:14.881 --> 43:16.980
What's the matter, Princess?

43:16.982 --> 43:19.618
Feeling a little slow?

43:19.620 --> 43:21.522
Yes, actually. I am.

43:31.765 --> 43:33.130
What are you doing?

43:33.132 --> 43:35.136
Changing the battlefield.

43:50.049 --> 43:54.553
Must stop intruders.

43:54.555 --> 43:58.225
Must stop intruders.

44:04.364 --> 44:05.498
Stay.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.899
Where are you going?

44:07.901 --> 44:09.967
You can't leave me like this.

44:11.238 --> 44:14.705
Well, obviously you can,
but I deserve...

44:16.241 --> 44:18.442
Exactly what I'm getting.

44:20.781 --> 44:25.116
Must stop intruders.

44:25.118 --> 44:29.123
- Must stop intruders.
- Stand down.

44:32.658 --> 44:33.660
See?

44:34.893 --> 44:36.226
Totally under control.

44:36.228 --> 44:37.497
Mmm-hmm.

44:38.265 --> 44:39.797
There you are.

44:39.799 --> 44:42.134
I'm so glad you're all right.

44:42.136 --> 44:44.703
If Hercules
can beat a Minotaur,

44:44.705 --> 44:45.904
so can I.

44:45.906 --> 44:47.408
Steve, stop trying.

44:48.709 --> 44:52.310
So, how does this
shrine-thing work?

44:52.312 --> 44:55.382
Do you hit star
for customer service or...

44:55.982 --> 44:57.718
You ask politely.

45:10.163 --> 45:13.598
Gods of Olympus, hear my plea.

45:13.600 --> 45:16.433
Show me the path to Themyscira.

45:16.435 --> 45:19.406
Show me the way home.

45:25.044 --> 45:26.479
Diana.

45:30.785 --> 45:32.353
Diana!

45:49.536 --> 45:50.571
Great Hera.

45:51.571 --> 45:52.937
What did you see?

45:52.939 --> 45:54.239
Much.

45:54.241 --> 45:56.243
But I can't make sense of it.

45:57.444 --> 45:59.911
I still don't know
where Themyscira is.

45:59.913 --> 46:04.585
Must... Stop... Intruders.

46:05.819 --> 46:09.187
Must stop intruders.

46:09.189 --> 46:10.321
Steve, don't.

46:10.323 --> 46:13.294
Must stop intruders.

46:13.960 --> 46:17.832
Must stop intruders.

46:30.810 --> 46:32.210
Peace, friend.

46:32.212 --> 46:34.747
There is nothing left
for you to protect.

46:35.181 --> 46:36.417
You...

46:37.084 --> 46:38.752
You freed me.

46:40.154 --> 46:41.689
What is your name?

46:42.388 --> 46:44.657
Diana of Themyscira.

46:45.725 --> 46:47.891
An Amazon.

46:47.893 --> 46:52.132
I pledge my life to you,
Diana of Themyscira.

46:54.502 --> 46:58.270
And I will shelter and protect
you for all of my days.

46:58.272 --> 46:59.904
Um...

46:59.906 --> 47:01.408
Ferdinand?

47:02.942 --> 47:04.145
What?

47:04.944 --> 47:08.980
Hmm, an excellent name.

47:08.982 --> 47:10.618
Then rise, Ferdinand.

47:12.386 --> 47:15.319
And know that you will never
need to fight again.

47:15.321 --> 47:17.020
Listen, Di.

47:17.022 --> 47:19.390
I am happy to have another guy,

47:19.392 --> 47:20.859
sort of, on the team,

47:20.861 --> 47:22.861
but we still don't know
where to go.

47:22.863 --> 47:25.163
True. We should
return to Vanessa.

47:25.165 --> 47:28.098
Once I figure out the meaning of my
vision, we'll need to move quickly.

47:28.100 --> 47:31.136
- -I just
got a text from Veronica Cale.

47:31.138 --> 47:33.641
Ooh, she does not sound happy.

47:39.379 --> 47:42.913
We found this
on some of the molecules

47:42.915 --> 47:44.751
from Poison's compounds.

47:45.852 --> 47:47.618
It's your logo.

47:47.620 --> 47:49.254
There's more good news.

47:49.256 --> 47:51.623
My techs found our micro-stamp

47:51.625 --> 47:54.795
as soon as we examined
Vanessa's blood work.

47:57.131 --> 47:59.964
She may not be
your only problem.

47:59.966 --> 48:02.199
We had company
when we got to the shrine.

48:02.201 --> 48:05.506
Your people were the only ones
who knew where we were headed.

48:06.172 --> 48:07.605
That's ridiculous.

48:07.607 --> 48:09.873
Vanessa Kapatelis
is the only employee

48:09.875 --> 48:12.844
to ever leak
sensitive information.

48:12.846 --> 48:15.547
Maybe she deserves
to stay the way she is.

48:15.549 --> 48:16.815
You can't mean that.

48:16.817 --> 48:19.417
What Vanessa did,
she did from pain.

48:19.419 --> 48:20.819
She's lost.

48:20.821 --> 48:23.388
She thinks Julia died
disappointed in her.

48:23.390 --> 48:25.426
Do you know how much
that can hurt?

48:27.125 --> 48:28.993
Are you kidding?

48:28.995 --> 48:31.629
My mother could freeze ice
with a look.

48:31.631 --> 48:33.700
Chilled her drinks that way.

48:37.203 --> 48:38.904
Fine, Princess.

48:38.906 --> 48:42.440
You've talked me back
to the side of the angels.

48:42.442 --> 48:43.844
What's our next step?

48:44.777 --> 48:46.210
I don't know.

48:46.212 --> 48:48.612
I did have
a vision at the shrine.

48:48.614 --> 48:50.714
I just can't decipher it.

48:50.716 --> 48:53.553
There were flowers, my mother,

48:54.286 --> 48:55.723
strange fish.

48:56.656 --> 48:57.888
Really?

48:57.890 --> 48:59.556
The Mediterranean's
so over-fished,

48:59.558 --> 49:01.926
certain species have been
reduced to tiny pockets.

49:01.928 --> 49:05.565
Themyscira could be the place
where all those components meet.

49:08.401 --> 49:09.768
Okay, Princess.

49:09.770 --> 49:11.872
Which of these looks familiar?

49:33.091 --> 49:36.226
"Seek and ye shall find."

49:36.228 --> 49:38.062
I think we've got it.

49:38.064 --> 49:39.667
But there's nothing there.

49:40.232 --> 49:41.468
Almost.

49:42.636 --> 49:45.870
There's a seamount,
an underwater island.

49:45.872 --> 49:49.406
How much you wanna bet it's a
little bit taller in real life?

49:49.408 --> 49:52.143
Dr. Cale, you did it.

49:52.145 --> 49:53.478
<i>Brava, Doctor.</i>

49:53.480 --> 49:55.679
<i>Now that you've found
Themyscira,</i>

49:55.681 --> 49:57.882
<i>Dr. Poison and I have, too.</i>

49:57.884 --> 50:00.484
How did you access
our private server?

50:00.486 --> 50:03.422
<i>I wouldn't bother
calling your security team.</i>

50:03.424 --> 50:05.993
<i>I've got all your access codes.</i>

50:08.027 --> 50:10.328
Cyber, these people
have done nothing to you,

50:10.330 --> 50:12.029
neither have the other Amazons.

50:12.031 --> 50:13.931
If you and Dr. Poison
want vengeance, it should...

50:13.933 --> 50:16.000
<i>This isn't
about vengeance.</i>

50:16.002 --> 50:17.335
<i>It's about money.</i>

50:17.337 --> 50:20.103
<i>I've heard about the tech
the Amazons have</i>

50:20.105 --> 50:23.241
<i>and now that
we have their location,</i>

50:23.243 --> 50:25.576
<i>it's ours for the taking.</i>

50:25.578 --> 50:29.850
<i>Killing all of you
is just good business.</i>

50:31.984 --> 50:33.217
Oh, great.

50:33.219 --> 50:35.585
Cyber turned on
the contamination protocols.

50:35.587 --> 50:37.455
The computer thinks
a virus is loose,

50:37.457 --> 50:40.190
and it's been ordered
to sanitize.

50:40.192 --> 50:43.895
It means this entire floor
is about to be incinerated.

50:43.897 --> 50:46.600
<i>Wakey, wakey,
Silver Swan.</i>

51:07.754 --> 51:09.690
Why does it always get worse?

51:16.562 --> 51:19.263
Vanessa, you have
to listen to me.

51:19.265 --> 51:21.602
Those implants are killing you.

51:32.779 --> 51:34.245
We're trying to help.

51:34.247 --> 51:35.480
You're lying.

51:35.482 --> 51:37.348
You're trying
to steal my power,

51:37.350 --> 51:39.283
just like you stole my mother.

51:39.285 --> 51:40.753
That isn't true.

51:56.002 --> 51:57.805
Don't worry, Dr. Cale,
you're gonna be fine.

51:58.404 --> 51:59.804
How reassuring.

51:59.806 --> 52:02.042
And I thought you were
just the cute secretary.

52:13.620 --> 52:15.386
Please, Vanessa.

52:15.388 --> 52:16.788
This isn't you.

52:16.790 --> 52:18.589
You don't know me.

52:18.591 --> 52:20.357
I want this.

52:20.359 --> 52:21.692
Do you?

52:21.694 --> 52:23.831
It won't bring Julia back.

52:33.306 --> 52:35.475
Guns? So freakin' primitive.

52:55.562 --> 52:58.131
<i>Swan,
get out of there while she's distracted.</i>

53:02.502 --> 53:04.167
Hey, wait. I can't fly.

53:04.169 --> 53:05.571
You gotta save me too!

53:16.216 --> 53:19.717
You just had to wait for the
dramatic entrance, didn't you?

53:19.719 --> 53:21.988
I thought you liked
a little drama.

53:25.993 --> 53:27.625
We need to search the floor.

53:27.627 --> 53:30.027
There could still be survivors.

53:30.029 --> 53:31.696
Don't bother.

53:31.698 --> 53:34.632
That floor's empty and sealed off
from the rest of the building.

53:34.634 --> 53:36.100
Good thing, too.

53:36.102 --> 53:39.569
Now my company's
only partially destroyed.

53:39.571 --> 53:42.742
Poison and Cyber may have
declared war on Themyscira...

53:44.176 --> 53:46.743
But if there's one thing
Amazons know,

53:46.745 --> 53:48.548
it's how to fight a war.

53:50.517 --> 53:52.752
And it's time to fight.

53:59.692 --> 54:02.926
I take it you won't be
staying for dinner.

54:02.928 --> 54:04.228
No.

54:04.230 --> 54:07.734
But if we could get a to-go
box, that'd be great.

54:40.299 --> 54:42.799
Next stop, Themyscira.

54:42.801 --> 54:45.101
And hopefully an Amazon
who likes 'em thick.

54:45.103 --> 54:48.609
If we survive this,
I can make a few introductions.

55:02.154 --> 55:04.288
This isn't gonna end well,
you know.

55:04.290 --> 55:07.257
Well, we are flying to an
island of immortal warriors

55:07.259 --> 55:09.926
to save them from
a razor-winged killing machine.

55:09.928 --> 55:12.397
But I wouldn't worry too much.

55:12.399 --> 55:15.636
I meant this isn't going
to end well for Diana.

55:17.602 --> 55:19.171
I know what you meant.

55:20.239 --> 55:21.605
Whatever happens,

55:21.607 --> 55:24.841
there's a good chance
she's not coming back with us.

55:24.843 --> 55:27.713
Unless she had
a little motivation?

55:37.991 --> 55:41.328
You know, that's exactly the
effect I like to have on women.

55:42.828 --> 55:44.295
I know you've got my back.

55:44.297 --> 55:46.663
And this has been
a rather stressful time.

55:46.665 --> 55:48.232
You fought Darkseid.

55:48.234 --> 55:50.301
This is, like,
half as bad as that.

55:50.303 --> 55:51.902
A third, at best.

55:51.904 --> 55:54.371
Besides, you're gonna save
your own hometown.

55:54.373 --> 55:57.607
You play your cards right,
they'll make you queen.

55:57.609 --> 55:59.345
They won't make me queen.

56:00.712 --> 56:01.978
Yeah, you're right.

56:01.980 --> 56:03.880
It's not like you're
already royal,

56:03.882 --> 56:05.516
or blessed by the gods...

56:05.518 --> 56:07.083
They won't.

56:07.085 --> 56:08.788
Not after what I did.

56:11.323 --> 56:12.858
I stole this armor,

56:13.526 --> 56:15.491
the lasso, I...

56:15.493 --> 56:17.962
I betrayed my own mother.

56:17.964 --> 56:19.462
She let you go.

56:19.464 --> 56:20.733
No.

56:21.567 --> 56:24.634
After you left, we fought.

56:24.636 --> 56:28.007
I turned my sword
on my own mother.

56:30.042 --> 56:32.311
I've never seen her
more ashamed.

56:34.647 --> 56:39.549
Wonder Woman is a myth man's
world told itself about me.

56:39.551 --> 56:42.486
She didn't slink away
in the cover of night.

56:42.488 --> 56:45.991
She is not a disappointment
to her people, her mother.

56:46.859 --> 56:49.058
Screw her.
Screw them.

56:49.060 --> 56:52.529
Vanessa? The Amazons?

56:52.531 --> 56:55.501
Their lives can't be worth
less than mine.

56:57.437 --> 56:59.971
They can't be
worth more either.

56:59.973 --> 57:02.540
An Amazon does what is right.

57:02.542 --> 57:03.910
No matter the cost.

57:06.546 --> 57:08.245
You mean the world to me, Di.

57:08.247 --> 57:11.384
I, I just wish you wouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

57:13.520 --> 57:17.858
Steve, you mean
the world to me too.

57:24.230 --> 57:26.499
Uh, guys?

57:31.404 --> 57:32.906
Themyscira.

57:33.573 --> 57:35.505
It's here.

57:35.507 --> 57:36.810
I know it.

57:44.317 --> 57:46.553
Unfortunately, we're not
the only ones.

58:02.102 --> 58:05.203
Man's world has
come to Themyscira.

58:05.205 --> 58:08.141
Make sure they do not
find it wanting.

58:25.390 --> 58:28.792
This is why I don't like
being in the field.

58:28.794 --> 58:30.460
We've got
another signal inbound.

58:30.462 --> 58:32.395
Looks like the princess
found us.

58:32.397 --> 58:36.167
And here I was
starting to doubt them.

58:36.169 --> 58:38.872
Vanessa, hold off the heroes,
will you?

58:42.509 --> 58:44.775
I'll take care
of the front gate.

58:44.777 --> 58:46.344
You prep the prototype.

58:46.346 --> 58:49.513
I do so love mass destruction.

58:49.515 --> 58:51.984
Let's hope
she does too.

59:09.268 --> 59:10.935
She's gonna tear us apart!

59:12.471 --> 59:13.473
Diana, no!

59:15.107 --> 59:16.576
Just watch my back.

01:00:12.031 --> 01:00:14.431
I will not tell you twice,

01:00:14.433 --> 01:00:15.966
surrender.

01:00:15.968 --> 01:00:18.103
"Surrender?"

01:00:19.571 --> 01:00:21.340
Retreat! Retreat!

01:00:33.152 --> 01:00:36.356
A Gorgon does not surrender
to Amazons.

01:00:41.093 --> 01:00:44.363
You truly are
a magnificent creature.

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.063
Once their tech is ours,

01:00:47.065 --> 01:00:49.433
I'm going to build
an army of you

01:00:49.435 --> 01:00:51.571
- strong enough to...
- Shh.

01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:55.973
Mortals talk too much.

01:00:55.975 --> 01:00:57.808
You serve us, monster.

01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:00.411
Whatever your plans were,

01:01:00.413 --> 01:01:01.645
know this,

01:01:01.647 --> 01:01:03.946
I am Medusa.

01:01:05.917 --> 01:01:08.018
No one controls my fate.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.922
No one holds my gaze.

01:01:10.924 --> 01:01:13.692
Not you mechanical puppets.

01:01:16.995 --> 01:01:18.962
And not small-minded fools

01:01:18.964 --> 01:01:21.397
who think they know
what they are dealing with.

01:01:21.399 --> 01:01:23.766
My apologies, Medusa.

01:01:23.768 --> 01:01:25.034
I can make it up to you.

01:01:25.036 --> 01:01:27.337
I can make you stronger.

01:01:27.339 --> 01:01:31.442
I did not come here
to rob the Amazons.

01:01:31.444 --> 01:01:33.712
Look at me, wretch.

01:01:38.216 --> 01:01:40.717
I came to destroy them.

01:01:40.719 --> 01:01:42.252
No, Medusa.

01:01:42.254 --> 01:01:44.024
No, don't!

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.382
My queen, we have to retreat.

01:03:52.585 --> 01:03:53.884
Fall back.

01:03:53.886 --> 01:03:55.185
To the inner gates.

01:03:55.187 --> 01:03:57.054
Vanessa, stop.

01:03:57.056 --> 01:03:58.558
You can still be healed.

01:04:01.593 --> 01:04:03.326
I am still your friend.

01:04:03.328 --> 01:04:05.664
Are you really that stupid?

01:04:08.935 --> 01:04:10.833
This isn't about friendship.

01:04:10.835 --> 01:04:12.103
Or family.

01:04:12.105 --> 01:04:14.770
This is an eye
for an eye, Diana.

01:04:18.777 --> 01:04:21.911
You hurt me,
and now I hurt you.

01:04:26.685 --> 01:04:28.821
No matter what you've done,
I'm still with you.

01:04:30.221 --> 01:04:31.924
I won't let you go.

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:54.479
Fall back.
Fall back.

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.593
Great Hera.

01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:17.067
Oh, shit.

01:05:22.073 --> 01:05:23.574
Go help her, I got this.

01:05:23.576 --> 01:05:24.944
But you don't know how to...

01:05:27.913 --> 01:05:29.482
I got this!

01:05:38.357 --> 01:05:41.326
No one escapes my vengeance.

01:05:43.928 --> 01:05:45.430
You can't be her.

01:05:46.364 --> 01:05:48.265
Perseus killed Medusa.

01:05:48.267 --> 01:05:51.467
And now I've been reborn.

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.904
Could a mere replica do this?

01:05:55.741 --> 01:05:57.040
Stop!

01:05:57.042 --> 01:05:59.542
Whatever Poison told you,
whatever Cyber did to you,

01:05:59.544 --> 01:06:02.145
you can choose another path.

01:06:02.147 --> 01:06:04.948
We do not
have to be your enemies.

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:07.018
I know the Amazons.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.087
We have always been enemies.

01:06:10.089 --> 01:06:13.893
And if your mother begs
sweetly enough...

01:06:14.359 --> 01:06:16.192
Diana.

01:06:16.194 --> 01:06:20.765
I promise to turn her to stone
before I take off her limbs.

01:06:20.767 --> 01:06:22.000
Now that...

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:26.005
I will not allow.

01:06:40.118 --> 01:06:41.520
Close the gates.

01:07:22.194 --> 01:07:23.528
No!

01:07:33.705 --> 01:07:35.674
Steve, no. Don't look.

01:07:42.348 --> 01:07:44.650
Oh, you like them.

01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:47.920
I must remember that.

01:08:04.536 --> 01:08:08.437
My lovelies
have very special venom.

01:08:08.439 --> 01:08:10.507
Eats through almost anything.

01:08:30.295 --> 01:08:32.127
Gods defend us.

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:35.765
There's no way Diana
can defeat that monster.

01:08:35.768 --> 01:08:38.435
- I meant...
- You meant what you said.

01:08:38.437 --> 01:08:40.303
And you may well be right.

01:08:40.305 --> 01:08:43.675
This may not be a fight
my daughter can win.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.566
Look at me, girl.

01:09:43.969 --> 01:09:46.136
Let me go.

01:09:46.138 --> 01:09:47.670
I have to look.

01:09:47.671 --> 01:09:49.872
No! Listen to me, Vanessa.

01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:52.044
I will not let her harm you.

01:09:54.813 --> 01:09:57.146
I deserve this.

01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:00.219
I deserve this.

01:10:00.919 --> 01:10:02.886
I know you think that.

01:10:02.888 --> 01:10:04.954
That you're not enough
for those who loved you.

01:10:04.956 --> 01:10:06.890
That you never will be.

01:10:06.892 --> 01:10:09.026
I've felt that fear too.

01:10:09.028 --> 01:10:10.893
But I knew my purpose
in this life,

01:10:10.895 --> 01:10:13.096
and if it is at all
in my power,

01:10:13.098 --> 01:10:17.034
you will survive long enough
to learn yours.

01:10:17.036 --> 01:10:19.802
By all means, Amazon,

01:10:19.804 --> 01:10:22.539
try to compel her not to look.

01:10:22.541 --> 01:10:25.211
It will only tear
her mind apart.

01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:28.980
She can't see you through me.

01:10:29.514 --> 01:10:31.313
Very well, hero.

01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:33.853
You can look at me first.

01:10:37.422 --> 01:10:39.323
I will not.

01:10:39.325 --> 01:10:42.392
Look at me.

01:10:42.394 --> 01:10:45.931
I refuse.

01:10:49.801 --> 01:10:51.970
Look at me.

01:10:55.172 --> 01:10:57.841
Are you a fool?

01:10:57.843 --> 01:11:01.279
You can't poison me
with my own venom.

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:07.051
Perhaps.

01:11:07.053 --> 01:11:09.854
But that is not
what I was planning.

01:11:24.736 --> 01:11:27.236
No! Look at me!

01:11:27.238 --> 01:11:29.140
As you wish.

01:12:00.572 --> 01:12:03.573
The princess
cannot survive this.

01:12:03.575 --> 01:12:06.109
She does not intend to.

01:12:06.111 --> 01:12:09.411
She will die if she can
take the monster with her.

01:12:09.413 --> 01:12:11.850
Like a true Amazon.

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:55.057
You wanted me to choose a path
for myself, Diana.

01:12:55.059 --> 01:12:57.696
I choose to stand by you.

01:13:32.697 --> 01:13:34.530
Keep a hand on me.

01:13:34.532 --> 01:13:36.299
I'll get you to her.

01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:37.769
You do the rest.

01:14:13.839 --> 01:14:15.672
Steve.

01:14:15.674 --> 01:14:17.009
No!

01:14:35.193 --> 01:14:36.861
Steve!

01:14:50.975 --> 01:14:53.278
I'm so proud of you, Vanessa.

01:14:54.813 --> 01:14:56.215
Diana.

01:15:00.285 --> 01:15:01.287
Mother,

01:15:02.054 --> 01:15:04.156
I am so sorry.

01:15:05.991 --> 01:15:08.560
I'm sorry I couldn't be
the daughter you wanted.

01:15:18.068 --> 01:15:20.904
My little girl.

01:15:20.906 --> 01:15:23.843
You were a true Amazon today.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.316
I know the title they gave you
in man's world.

01:15:33.318 --> 01:15:36.485
For so long,
it was hard for me to hear

01:15:36.487 --> 01:15:39.924
because it meant you were not
my Diana anymore,

01:15:40.693 --> 01:15:42.261
you were theirs.

01:15:43.027 --> 01:15:44.630
I was so wrong.

01:15:46.165 --> 01:15:48.597
You have earned their name.

01:15:48.599 --> 01:15:50.401
You truly are

01:15:51.403 --> 01:15:53.305
a Wonder Woman.

01:15:56.207 --> 01:15:58.911
I will always be your Diana.

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:02.281
But I came here with a mission.

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:06.552
Will you help us?

01:16:34.112 --> 01:16:35.745
Amazons,

01:16:35.747 --> 01:16:37.547
my sisters,

01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:39.216
my friends.

01:16:39.218 --> 01:16:42.384
Long have we been
separated from man's world.

01:16:42.386 --> 01:16:44.454
At the behest of the gods,

01:16:44.456 --> 01:16:48.290
and then the folly
of your queen.

01:16:48.292 --> 01:16:53.463
But now, I see it is past time that
we were called back into the realm.

01:16:53.465 --> 01:16:56.231
- My daughter told me a long time ago...
- Congratulations, angel.

01:16:56.233 --> 01:16:59.535
...that the gods were calling
for our return.

01:16:59.537 --> 01:17:04.374
That there were those outside
our borders that needed our help.

01:17:04.376 --> 01:17:08.911
Raise up your voice to Diana,

01:17:08.913 --> 01:17:11.213
the champion of Themyscira.

01:17:11.215 --> 01:17:13.950
All hail Diana!

01:17:13.952 --> 01:17:17.820
Known to all as Wonder Woman.

01:17:17.822 --> 01:17:20.990
All hail Diana!

01:17:20.992 --> 01:17:23.594
All hail Diana.

01:17:40.645 --> 01:17:43.413
It is good to be back
among my sisters.

01:17:43.415 --> 01:17:46.482
And, as my first act
as protector of Themyscira,

01:17:46.484 --> 01:17:48.918
it is my honor to proclaim,

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.056
let the games commence.

01:19:04.162 --> 01:19:05.994
Well, bless your heart.

01:19:05.996 --> 01:19:07.763
You figured it out.

01:19:07.765 --> 01:19:10.268
I had to go blind
to see your treachery.

01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:12.703
Why, Dr. Cale?

01:19:13.737 --> 01:19:15.304
Because of you, dear.

01:19:15.306 --> 01:19:18.575
Julia never stopped raving
about you marvelous Amazons

01:19:18.577 --> 01:19:22.110
whose technology
I couldn't even dream of.

01:19:22.112 --> 01:19:24.414
However, I could take it.

01:19:24.416 --> 01:19:27.152
But the only person
that could find it

01:19:28.153 --> 01:19:29.651
was you.

01:19:29.653 --> 01:19:32.690
You just had to be
properly motivated.

01:19:33.692 --> 01:19:36.392
You killed Julia.

01:19:36.394 --> 01:19:40.329
<i>I couldn't let her figure
out I was bankrolling Poison and Cyber.</i>

01:19:40.331 --> 01:19:42.434
<i>Not even Vanessa knew that.</i>

01:19:44.836 --> 01:19:48.873
Vanessa became my weapon
and you gave up your island.

01:19:50.041 --> 01:19:52.008
Your attack failed.

01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:54.143
Themyscira is whole.

01:19:54.145 --> 01:19:56.378
And exactly where I left it.

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.349
I'm looking forward
to visiting.

01:20:00.352 --> 01:20:01.883
That reminds me.

01:20:01.885 --> 01:20:04.856
You asked me to bring you back
something from home.

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:14.030
My mother and I are reconciled
thanks to you.

01:20:14.032 --> 01:20:17.736
Which means I am now officially
the champion of Themyscira.

01:20:19.237 --> 01:20:22.771
If you seek to harm it,
or my friends,

01:20:22.773 --> 01:20:24.408
you should have a weapon.

01:20:31.049 --> 01:20:33.583
You think I'm intimidated?

01:20:33.585 --> 01:20:34.749
I've won.

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:37.286
I'm coming for you,
Wonder Woman.

01:20:37.288 --> 01:20:39.387
Do you hear me, Wonder Woman?

01:20:39.389 --> 01:20:42.160
I am coming for you!
