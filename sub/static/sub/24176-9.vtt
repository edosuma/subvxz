WEBVTT

00:32.521 --> 00:34.641
Directors, area managers,
account managers.

00:34.841 --> 00:37.321
All the important men from Publitalia.

00:37.521 --> 00:41.081
You're sure it's a good idea?
They're just good at selling.

00:41.321 --> 00:45.241
- They haven't a clue about politics.
- It doesn't matter.

00:46.201 --> 00:48.801
They're well-established here,
like a party.

00:49.521 --> 00:51.801
They have a network of loyal clients,
like a party,

00:51.881 --> 00:54.881
but unlike a party these men
have othervalues.

00:55.081 --> 00:56.961
Efficiency, team work...

00:57.081 --> 00:58.841
We don't need politicians...

00:59.641 --> 01:01.681
we have to sell a dream.

01:03.561 --> 01:06.161
Okay, you've persuaded me.

01:06.361 --> 01:08.121
What's the plan?

01:08.881 --> 01:11.921
Let's have some meetings,
or rather, some auditions!

01:12.641 --> 01:15.921
- Auditions?
- We need telegenic faces.

01:17.241 --> 01:18.761
Yes?

01:18.961 --> 01:21.001
Mr. Dell'Utri has sent you this.

01:21.201 --> 01:24.401
- Thanks, Clara.
- He's sending you gifts...

01:26.121 --> 01:27.841
"Petrolio"?

01:37.281 --> 01:40.081
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I received the book.

01:40.281 --> 01:43.281
<i>They finally published it,
it's taken years!</i>

01:43.481 --> 01:45.241
I wanted to thank you.

01:46.681 --> 01:48.561
And I've something to ask you:

01:48.761 --> 01:52.281
I want to do some interviews
with Publitalia's top men,

01:52.481 --> 01:54.481
a sort of motivational video.

01:54.681 --> 01:58.201
<i>I don't believe in that bullshit,
but you're the marketing guru.</i>

01:58.401 --> 02:00.201
There'll be a cost involved.

02:00.401 --> 02:03.481
<i>You have access to
a billion lira account, Notte.</i>

02:03.681 --> 02:07.881
- So you approve?
<i>- Do you need to ask me twice?</i>

02:11.281 --> 02:13.281
You have to tell him.

02:13.481 --> 02:16.321
- He'd say no.
- Maybe he'll like your idea.

02:16.521 --> 02:20.281
- You're not going to tell him?
- I will, but not now.

02:20.361 --> 02:23.561
We'll make it look like an electoral
video, we'll persuade him!

02:24.281 --> 02:27.241
- Where are you going?
- We need a video camera.

03:57.721 --> 03:58.921
Put it back on.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.761
What the hell's wrong? What's up?

04:02.281 --> 04:04.881
- Give me the wine!
- What the hell's up with you?

04:08.881 --> 04:12.881
I'm pregnant!
That's what's wrong, you jerk.

04:17.681 --> 04:20.361
OCTOBER 15th

04:26.401 --> 04:27.761
Excuse me, can I help you?

04:29.121 --> 04:30.441
I'm here to see Ms Grandi.

04:30.961 --> 04:32.721
She's not here.

04:33.681 --> 04:36.081
- Really?
- She's on leave.

04:36.281 --> 04:40.081
Out of the blue?
She gave me an appointment yesterday.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.881
I don't know,
it was a surprise for us too.

04:43.081 --> 04:46.281
I called her at home,
but they told me she's gone away.

04:46.481 --> 04:50.281
- Can you help me contact her?
- No, I'm sorry.

04:53.321 --> 04:54.881
Come on.

04:55.281 --> 04:56.601
Get out of there.

04:56.761 --> 04:58.441
Are you nuts?

04:59.281 --> 05:02.041
Shit, you're freezing cold.

05:04.841 --> 05:07.281
You don't need to worry, okay?

05:07.481 --> 05:09.481
I'll take care of everything.

05:10.481 --> 05:12.881
I can't have a baby.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.081
I'll find you another job on TV.

05:17.481 --> 05:19.681
It'll only be a few months.

05:21.481 --> 05:23.881
You won't miss out on anything.

05:28.281 --> 05:30.281
Do you want it?

05:37.161 --> 05:38.801
I'll be right back.

05:42.441 --> 05:43.961
Hello?

05:45.601 --> 05:47.761
No, I can't right now.

05:48.961 --> 05:51.641
I see... all right.

05:57.801 --> 06:01.481
Listen, I need to get changed
and go to Parliament.

06:02.641 --> 06:04.681
Will you do me a favor?

06:05.121 --> 06:07.281
Think about it.

06:07.881 --> 06:09.721
Okay?

06:12.081 --> 06:14.681
Put some clothes on, it's cold.

06:23.241 --> 06:25.881
- Did you want to see me?
- Come in.

06:28.201 --> 06:30.161
Borto, how are you?

06:30.361 --> 06:31.961
Sit down.

06:34.121 --> 06:35.801
What is it?

06:36.241 --> 06:39.321
What did you do
at the Defense Committee meeting?

06:41.561 --> 06:45.481
I know the Northern League
don't give a shit about the Gulf War.

06:45.681 --> 06:48.481
I also know that
Bossi supported Saddam.

06:48.801 --> 06:51.081
But I've been there...

06:51.281 --> 06:54.521
- I know what happened...
- What are you ranting on about?

06:56.521 --> 07:01.281
You voted with the CDs against
cutting military expenditure, idiot!

07:03.401 --> 07:05.561
You mean this?

07:05.881 --> 07:08.761
Yes! You've really
put your foot in it!

07:12.201 --> 07:16.001
I'm a soldier, why would I vote
for cutting military expenditure?

07:17.041 --> 07:19.001
It's nothing to do
with being a soldier,

07:19.081 --> 07:22.281
you voted against it because
your friend Nobile asked you to.

07:22.481 --> 07:26.761
He didn't want his friend Locetra
to lose his arms contract!

07:27.721 --> 07:29.681
What the hell are you saying?

07:29.881 --> 07:33.681
That you're chums with
your Christian Democrat neighbor

07:33.881 --> 07:35.601
who's from Naples too!

07:36.081 --> 07:38.681
So you've never had
a Christian Democrat neighbor?

07:38.881 --> 07:41.281
Italy is full of Christian Democrats.

07:41.481 --> 07:44.161
Nobile lives above me, so?

07:44.361 --> 07:48.681
You did him a favor
by helping his friend Locetra.

07:50.001 --> 07:53.001
You don't give a damn
who the State buys arms from.

07:53.201 --> 07:55.281
Of course I do!

07:55.481 --> 07:58.681
Locetra is a member of the Camorra,
didn't you know?

08:01.321 --> 08:05.361
What a jerk!
He didn't know, innocent soul.

08:06.001 --> 08:07.961
You screwed up.

08:08.161 --> 08:12.801
And thanks to you, the Northern League
helped a criminal.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.601
I didn't know he was a Camorra member.

08:25.041 --> 08:26.121
Borto!

08:32.481 --> 08:34.161
Borto!

08:35.081 --> 08:36.601
- Excuse me.
- How rude!

08:38.481 --> 08:42.081
You didn't take my advice,
I won't protect you anymore.

08:42.281 --> 08:44.641
Are you mad because
I didn't kiss you?

08:44.881 --> 08:47.281
Fuck off! My wife's over there!

08:47.481 --> 08:51.641
- I didn't tell anyone, jerk!
- You can tell who you like.

08:51.881 --> 08:55.481
No one'll believe you, not anymore!

08:55.641 --> 08:57.881
You're really pushing your luck,
understood?

08:58.081 --> 09:00.881
No, you are, damn Batman.

09:01.281 --> 09:03.481
- The old parties will fall.
- So?

09:03.641 --> 09:05.881
Di Pietro is kicking their ass.

09:06.081 --> 09:09.481
This government will end
before its term ends.

09:09.641 --> 09:12.641
And MPs won't get a pension,
do you understand?

09:12.881 --> 09:14.881
I don't give a shit about pensions!

09:15.081 --> 09:18.881
You should, because when
the Chambers are dissolved,

09:19.081 --> 09:22.641
Northern League won't nominate you
again after what you did.

09:22.881 --> 09:24.881
It'll be over for you!

09:25.601 --> 09:30.081
- You're a piece of shit.
- Move, my wife's waiting for me.

09:42.201 --> 09:44.081
Of course.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.361
Tonight?

09:51.961 --> 09:54.401
- Excuse me... leave!
- We need to talk.

09:54.601 --> 09:56.881
- We need to talk.
- Shall I call security?

09:57.081 --> 09:59.561
No, it's fine, you can go.

10:10.281 --> 10:12.281
You were right.

10:12.881 --> 10:17.641
Your father wasn't involved,
I just needed someone to hate.

10:18.601 --> 10:21.121
You've realized now that he's dead?

10:23.241 --> 10:26.281
For six months...
I touched no one.

10:28.081 --> 10:29.721
I kept my distance from everyone.

10:31.281 --> 10:33.641
Then I met you.

10:34.841 --> 10:37.641
And you touched me,
you weren't afraid.

10:37.881 --> 10:40.281
What else do you want from me?

10:41.721 --> 10:43.961
Tell me you feel nothing for me.

10:44.321 --> 10:46.841
I feel nothing for you.

11:15.481 --> 11:17.161
Get out!

11:17.441 --> 11:18.961
Get out.

11:19.161 --> 11:21.441
Go away, please. Get out!

11:54.721 --> 11:58.441
<i>- Hello?
- Don't put any more calls through.</i>

11:58.601 --> 12:01.321
Do you have any special anecdotes
about the company

12:01.521 --> 12:04.321
that you can tell us about?

12:04.521 --> 12:06.881
Berlusconi is the greatest salesman
in the world.

12:07.081 --> 12:10.441
The greatest part
is looking after the client's interest

12:10.601 --> 12:12.441
while optimizing ours.

12:12.601 --> 12:16.201
- Come on, I'll take you to Hollywood.
- Shall I look there or at you?

12:16.321 --> 12:20.081
We're used to winning
and winning makes you high.

12:20.481 --> 12:24.441
So he says:
"The winner will get a Ferrari."

12:25.641 --> 12:28.561
He'd say:
"Let's all recite the TV listings

12:28.721 --> 12:30.561
and learn it off by heart."

12:30.721 --> 12:33.361
When he came to work on Mondays,
at the meetings,

12:33.561 --> 12:37.881
he'd teach us about the company's
fundamental philosophical values.

12:38.081 --> 12:40.601
We're an army of victors.

12:40.721 --> 12:41.681
Thank you.

12:41.881 --> 12:44.521
- Shares, ratings...
- He makes you dream.

12:46.441 --> 12:47.521
Goodbye.

12:49.081 --> 12:51.281
Weren't they supposed to talk
about politics?

12:52.361 --> 12:54.521
They ran an experiment at Harvard.

12:55.561 --> 13:00.081
100 freshmen watched a silent film
showing their future teachers.

13:00.281 --> 13:03.961
- A silent film?
- They voted for the best teacher.

13:04.161 --> 13:07.161
Then they showed the same film
to 100 second year students

13:07.361 --> 13:09.521
who'd had those same teachers.

13:09.961 --> 13:12.001
They chose the same teachers.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.561
- It's not what you say that counts.
- It's how you say it.

13:20.161 --> 13:22.041
What do you think of this lot?

13:22.241 --> 13:24.241
I'd do it with all of them.

13:25.081 --> 13:28.201
- All of them?
- Yes, they're all my type.

13:28.401 --> 13:31.041
- What is your type?
- My type...

13:31.241 --> 13:33.241
looks like an honest guy...

13:34.521 --> 13:38.241
but has an enormous dark side.

13:38.601 --> 13:42.961
When you said "enormous"
I thought you meant something else.

13:46.721 --> 13:49.601
Create a clip with Pellegrini
using the best bits.

13:50.201 --> 13:52.561
When you're done, call me.

13:59.201 --> 14:02.841
I dreamt that a man's arm
came out from there.

14:03.561 --> 14:05.961
Muscly, hairy...

14:06.561 --> 14:09.721
- With talons.
- A comforting thought.

14:10.561 --> 14:14.161
There. You can sit up now.

14:14.601 --> 14:16.241
The torture is over.

14:16.721 --> 14:19.361
You're sure you don't want it?

14:20.001 --> 14:24.721
You've terminated two pregnancies,
a third can be risky.

14:24.961 --> 14:27.601
You may not be able to have children.

14:57.081 --> 15:00.561
I can't go back to my job,
I screwed up.

15:01.481 --> 15:03.561
How do you expect me to help?

15:07.041 --> 15:10.721
- Give me 800 million.
- 800 million?

15:11.201 --> 15:13.481
Where will I get it?

15:14.161 --> 15:16.121
Come on, Leo...

15:19.361 --> 15:22.961
"You have access to
a billion lira account...

15:23.561 --> 15:25.121
Notte."

15:25.321 --> 15:28.481
- Dammit, are you spying on me?
- Nonsense!

15:28.641 --> 15:33.921
These new cell phones
are so easy to intercept!

15:34.121 --> 15:36.441
I couldn't resist.

15:41.041 --> 15:45.721
I can't, any withdrawals over
10 million need Dell'Utri's signature.

15:46.521 --> 15:48.721
The bank manager is a friend of his,

15:48.961 --> 15:52.521
he'd inform him immediately,
I'm sorry.

15:53.601 --> 15:56.161
I realize
this will get you in deep shit...

15:57.721 --> 16:01.561
but I have to get away
and I need money.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.921
I won't do it.

16:04.961 --> 16:06.721
Leo, Leo...

16:08.641 --> 16:11.361
you know I have the proof
of Bianca's murder.

16:17.441 --> 16:19.361
Fuck you.

16:25.721 --> 16:27.281
Fuck you!

16:32.601 --> 16:34.361
Have you finished?

16:37.561 --> 16:42.521
Let's do this: you give me the money
and I'll give you the proof.

16:43.161 --> 16:46.361
So I can start a new life
and you can destroy the past.

16:46.561 --> 16:48.361
That's fair, right?

16:52.721 --> 16:55.121
You've got one week.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.961
You haven't even asked me why
I only want 800 million.

17:03.441 --> 17:05.961
I know there's a billion
in that account...

17:08.361 --> 17:11.721
I'll leave you the rest,
so you can start over.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.961
I've already done it once,
I can't do it again.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.361
People like you always can.

17:39.521 --> 17:41.641
<i>Bibi, I've been trying to call you
for two days.</i>

17:42.281 --> 17:44.561
<i>You've found me now.</i>

17:44.721 --> 17:47.641
<i>You can'tjust disappear like that.</i>

17:48.561 --> 17:50.561
- Is that clear?
- What's happened?

17:50.721 --> 17:55.361
We had an emergency, we had to
release some pharmaceuticals.

17:55.561 --> 17:58.961
- Is "release" a euphemism?
- Don't act smart.

17:59.161 --> 18:03.561
This is how it works, oil the machine
to keep it running smoothly.

18:03.721 --> 18:06.801
If it works so well,
why the long face?

18:07.001 --> 18:09.921
One of our components is faulty.

18:10.121 --> 18:13.121
- A Budget Committee CD member.
- The Budget Committee?

18:13.321 --> 18:16.401
<i>Bibi, wake up!
They're the ones who approve</i>

18:16.601 --> 18:19.241
any variations in health expenditure.

18:19.441 --> 18:23.161
Did you offer him a kickback
but he refused?

18:23.361 --> 18:26.481
<i>All right, what can we do?</i>

18:26.641 --> 18:30.801
Nothing, but I have someone who'll
ruin this ungrateful guy.

18:30.921 --> 18:33.161
- Who's this ungrateful guy?
- Gaetano Nobile.

18:35.361 --> 18:37.201
<i>Is this our usual method?</i>

18:38.721 --> 18:41.001
Don't disappear again!

18:49.721 --> 18:51.281
Attilio.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.521
What happened to Raffaella Grandi?

18:53.681 --> 18:57.361
She took leave out of the blue
without telling me.

18:57.561 --> 18:59.601
Maybe she needed a holiday.

19:02.921 --> 19:04.601
What?

19:04.961 --> 19:09.561
That thing about the pharmaceuticals,
what does it entail?

19:23.401 --> 19:24.561
Wait!

19:27.121 --> 19:29.161
The Northern League is furious.

19:29.721 --> 19:32.361
They found out that I helped Locetra.

19:32.561 --> 19:34.601
You didn't tell me he was
a Camorra member.

19:34.801 --> 19:38.561
A Camorra member? Hold on,
he's not been convicted.

19:38.721 --> 19:40.721
"In dubio pro reo".

19:40.961 --> 19:44.241
We're all innocent
until proven guilty.

19:44.441 --> 19:46.961
They've told me I won't be reinstated.
Thanks!

19:47.161 --> 19:50.201
- Thanks for your help.
- I'm sorry, really.

19:50.601 --> 19:52.561
It's too late now.

19:54.081 --> 19:56.161
Why don't you join us?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.801
- The Christian Democrats?
- Yes.

19:59.001 --> 20:01.281
- Come off it!
- It's a good idea.

20:01.481 --> 20:05.561
I've still got power, I can make sure
you get elected.

20:05.721 --> 20:08.361
That way you won't abandon politics
because of me

20:08.561 --> 20:11.721
and the CDs will benefit
from a new, fresh face.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.521
We desperately need that.

20:16.121 --> 20:19.921
You'll see, your Northern League
friends will change their minds,

20:20.121 --> 20:24.201
politicians are flexible,
unlike magistrates.

20:24.401 --> 20:28.961
Didn't you hear? I'm going to Milan,
to be questioned by Di Pietro.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.161
I'm being investigated.

20:39.361 --> 20:41.961
I'm worried about you.

20:43.081 --> 20:45.161
Are you?

20:45.361 --> 20:47.281
That means you still care.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.961
I don't have children.

20:55.361 --> 20:58.361
- So?
- What I mean is...

20:58.721 --> 21:01.961
I've never been able to teach anyone
anything.

21:02.161 --> 21:05.561
But with you... I enjoyed it.

21:06.041 --> 21:08.361
That hadn't happened to me for years.

21:09.641 --> 21:11.961
I hope I didn't ruin everything.

21:14.161 --> 21:16.121
Have a safe trip.

21:17.841 --> 21:20.361
Let's hope it's not a one-way trip!

21:20.561 --> 21:23.121
No, you have parliamentary immunity!

21:23.321 --> 21:26.321
The last bastion of civilization!

21:46.321 --> 21:48.561
- Where are you?
<i>- Cold.</i>

21:51.681 --> 21:53.361
<i>Getting warmer...</i>

21:53.561 --> 21:55.361
<i>Warmer still.</i>

21:55.561 --> 21:57.361
<i>Hot!</i>

21:57.561 --> 22:01.721
Why are you up there?
Get down, you're worrying me.

22:06.161 --> 22:08.521
You know what they'll build here?

22:08.681 --> 22:11.361
A plastic surgery clinic.

22:11.801 --> 22:13.961
Good to know.

22:14.521 --> 22:16.721
That wasn't the original plan.

22:18.361 --> 22:22.441
I wanted to build a research centre
to find a cure for AIDS.

22:23.041 --> 22:27.321
Whenever I try to do a good thing,
something happens.

22:27.961 --> 22:30.561
Meaning? That they stop you?

22:32.121 --> 22:34.561
Plastic surgery is the future.

22:35.361 --> 22:37.721
Who am I to stop the future
from happening?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.961
This will be the car park.

22:45.561 --> 22:48.441
A nice slab of concrete...

22:48.601 --> 22:50.801
And this will all disappear.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.601
I might have to leave.

22:53.281 --> 22:56.961
- To go where?
- Buenos Aires, Rio...

22:59.881 --> 23:02.241
- You decide.
- Me?

23:04.721 --> 23:06.601
Come with me.

23:06.801 --> 23:08.561
I wish I could.

23:10.561 --> 23:12.561
Are you joking?

23:18.001 --> 23:20.321
Of course I am.

23:29.161 --> 23:33.601
OCTOBER 18th

23:35.881 --> 23:37.481
Goodbye.

23:42.881 --> 23:44.641
Good morning.

23:44.961 --> 23:48.161
- A ticket to Havana.
- Return?

23:48.561 --> 23:50.601
Just one-way.

24:01.321 --> 24:05.281
We're right near Vatican City,
priests have great taste.

24:05.641 --> 24:08.081
This is the first bedroom.

24:08.721 --> 24:11.361
There are two bathrooms here.

24:13.361 --> 24:16.321
And this is another bedroom.

24:16.521 --> 24:19.161
It could be used as a guest room

24:19.361 --> 24:21.161
or a child's bedroom.

24:21.361 --> 24:24.321
- How much is it?
- Don't worry.

24:24.521 --> 24:26.721
Two and half million bills excluded.

24:27.161 --> 24:31.721
There's a huge living room.
It's bright, with a great view!

24:31.961 --> 24:35.721
Now you'll see why I kept
the terrace till last.

24:36.161 --> 24:39.561
Personally, I think it's
the best part of the house.

24:40.561 --> 24:43.521
Look at this!
Shit, it's great!

24:44.561 --> 24:46.561
What an amazing view.

24:46.921 --> 24:50.161
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I do.

24:51.521 --> 24:55.321
- But it's too expensive.
- Nonsense! We'll take it.

24:58.281 --> 25:00.321
I'll leave you alone.

25:03.121 --> 25:05.641
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter with you?

25:06.961 --> 25:08.161
Why?

25:08.361 --> 25:11.361
You've thrown yourself headfirst
into this.

25:11.561 --> 25:15.121
The house, the baby,
"I'll take care of everything"...

25:17.601 --> 25:20.321
You've decided to be a family man?

25:22.961 --> 25:25.561
Have you discovered
your paternal instinct?

25:26.561 --> 25:28.561
Good for you, I don't feel the same.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.601
I don't want this goddamn baby.

25:49.201 --> 25:51.601
Hi, Luca! You disappeared.

25:52.361 --> 25:54.721
Did Di Pietro really fire you?

25:55.601 --> 25:57.041
Yes.

25:57.241 --> 26:00.961
I'm sorry,
you and I made a good team.

26:01.361 --> 26:03.161
Are you waiting for Nobile?

26:03.361 --> 26:05.361
His colleague accused of corruption

26:05.561 --> 26:08.361
gave his name to Di Pietro
for a reduced sentence.

26:08.561 --> 26:11.361
What do you care? He fired you.

26:20.361 --> 26:23.961
I know who implicated you,
we need to talk.

26:26.441 --> 26:29.361
Mr. Nobile, did they find anything?

26:32.361 --> 26:36.881
You think I didn't know
the Mainaghis were behind this?

26:37.081 --> 26:39.721
They paid Onofri to say your name.

26:39.961 --> 26:42.041
You don't drink at all?

26:42.721 --> 26:46.481
I'm always a bit wary of teetotalers.

26:47.361 --> 26:50.161
What was the kickback
you turned down for?

26:53.121 --> 26:56.561
You're a police officer,
but you're off duty.

26:58.001 --> 27:01.321
Your HQ is steps away
but you're questioning me here.

27:02.081 --> 27:04.161
Your name means "Pastor" but...

27:04.601 --> 27:06.961
you don't look like a priest.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.401
Why should I confide in you?

27:12.721 --> 27:16.161
Because we both want revenge
on Beatrice Mainaghi.

27:16.361 --> 27:20.561
I imagine your resentment
is due to sentimental reasons, right?

27:21.361 --> 27:22.961
Personal ones.

27:27.481 --> 27:30.441
You're sure this is off the record?

27:31.601 --> 27:34.561
- No one will know anything.
- Okay.

27:36.521 --> 27:40.961
They wanted me to vote in favor
of a variation in health expenditure.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.161
Are you sure?

27:44.641 --> 27:46.961
So by paying the Budget Committee

27:47.161 --> 27:50.361
the State will approve
the purchase of pharmaceuticals?

27:51.161 --> 27:55.121
To do a job properly,
support from elsewhere is needed.

27:56.561 --> 27:58.721
The Ministry of Health?

28:00.441 --> 28:03.361
The National Health Service.

28:04.961 --> 28:08.881
Why do you keep asking me questions?
You already know the answers.

28:10.161 --> 28:12.961
Right now Italy is full of people
like you,

28:13.121 --> 28:16.361
paladins fighting for a just cause.

28:17.361 --> 28:20.961
It's a country that's temporarily
suffering from...

28:21.681 --> 28:25.921
dysmorphophobia: it has
a distorted view of itself.

28:28.561 --> 28:31.761
You're paying for the wine.

28:33.681 --> 28:36.081
Why did you turn it down?

28:36.281 --> 28:38.961
A sudden wave of honesty.

28:40.361 --> 28:46.201
I read an article some time ago
about Zenit's blood products.

28:46.401 --> 28:47.721
Well...

28:49.761 --> 28:51.801
there's a limit to everything...

28:52.161 --> 28:55.561
even for a cynical old man like me.

28:55.841 --> 28:59.401
Were the pharmaceuticals in question
blood products?

29:03.761 --> 29:06.361
Farewell, Pastore.

29:23.481 --> 29:27.401
- Excuse me. Some wine, please.
- Certainly.

29:35.361 --> 29:37.361
Have I ever told you about Milo?

29:38.961 --> 29:42.921
- Who's Milo?
- My brother.

29:43.121 --> 29:45.521
Five years younger than me.

29:46.521 --> 29:49.681
I used to get drunk,
get into fights...

29:49.961 --> 29:51.921
I played rugby.

29:53.681 --> 29:55.961
And so did Milo.

29:58.361 --> 30:01.561
We used to have fun stealing
our dad's car.

30:03.361 --> 30:05.361
We did it on purpose.

30:06.281 --> 30:09.681
He was always going on about
that goddamn car!

30:10.161 --> 30:14.161
11 years ago we went to a party
in Brescia.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.321
We'd had a bit to drink,

30:18.521 --> 30:20.681
no more than usual.

30:21.721 --> 30:23.601
I was driving.

30:27.801 --> 30:30.361
While we were driving home...

30:32.681 --> 30:35.761
the car skidded on a patch of ice.

30:43.721 --> 30:45.721
He was 17 years old.

30:51.761 --> 30:53.681
I'm sorry.

31:00.361 --> 31:02.201
Pietro.

31:06.641 --> 31:11.481
Having a baby won't change anything.
You know that, right?

31:15.881 --> 31:18.401
We can't bring him back to life.

31:26.241 --> 31:29.121
I met you shortly
after your mother died,

31:29.321 --> 31:31.321
you've never talked about
your father.

31:32.161 --> 31:34.761
My father is a piece of shit.

31:35.641 --> 31:37.601
My mother's no longer here.

31:37.801 --> 31:39.201
Neither is Milo.

31:40.361 --> 31:42.601
Me and you...

31:43.361 --> 31:45.761
we don't have anyone.

31:46.761 --> 31:50.161
Is it so wrong to want
a family of our own?

32:09.201 --> 32:11.001
I'm no longer hungry.

32:15.521 --> 32:18.961
Marina? It's me. Is Viola there?

32:21.641 --> 32:24.201
No, I'm leaving,
I wanted to say goodbye.

32:24.561 --> 32:28.161
Yes, I'll be gone a while.
Maybe I'll call back later.

32:28.361 --> 32:31.321
Marina! If I miss her, tell her...

32:33.201 --> 32:35.761
No, nothing...
tell her I said goodbye.

32:51.201 --> 32:53.521
- Hello?
<i>- Leo, where are you?</i>

32:53.841 --> 32:57.161
- I'm busy, what's up?
<i>- You were right, they're perfect.</i>

32:57.361 --> 32:59.881
<i>They're authentic,
really captivating!</i>

33:00.081 --> 33:02.881
The promo clip's finished?
Is it good?

33:03.081 --> 33:05.561
<i>Yes, but it's not complete,
we need you.</i>

33:06.401 --> 33:08.801
- Me?
- There must be a mistake.

33:09.761 --> 33:14.361
<i>You're cool, a great speaker
and the only expert on politics.</i>

33:15.161 --> 33:17.321
I'll call the director.

33:17.561 --> 33:20.361
<i>You're the ideal face.</i>

33:21.481 --> 33:23.441
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

33:24.361 --> 33:27.121
<i>Hello? Leo?</i>

33:39.081 --> 33:41.521
- You're a lucky bastard!
- Why?

33:41.721 --> 33:44.961
You've been offered a chance
to redeem yourself.

33:45.161 --> 33:49.241
- It doesn't happen to everyone.
- What do you mean?

33:50.761 --> 33:55.081
The Public Prosecutor in Milan
has requested permission to proceed

33:55.281 --> 33:57.561
against Gaetano Nobile, read this.

33:59.801 --> 34:02.561
The relevant committee
will give the go ahead,

34:02.761 --> 34:06.481
then it will be our turn to vote.
A recorded vote, Bosco.

34:07.561 --> 34:11.601
And I can assure you we'll pay
special attention to your vote.

34:13.401 --> 34:15.361
All right.

34:15.961 --> 34:21.761
And if it's true that you weren't
taken in by that CD mafioso

34:21.961 --> 34:24.761
you'll be able to prove it.

35:07.521 --> 35:09.201
Here he is!

35:12.161 --> 35:13.921
Here we are.

35:16.641 --> 35:21.281
I was thinking: if I have to run away,
what's the point in paying you?

35:25.481 --> 35:27.281
I'm joking.

35:27.841 --> 35:30.361
It's in the bonnet.

35:31.001 --> 35:35.681
- Hurry up, I've got a plane to catch.
- Are you forgetting something?

35:36.481 --> 35:37.921
No.

35:38.521 --> 35:40.921
I don't think so.

35:51.801 --> 35:53.481
Buio...

36:36.281 --> 36:38.281
Cold, isn't it?

36:43.641 --> 36:45.761
How the hell do you open it?

36:49.361 --> 36:51.001
Here.

40:51.921 --> 40:54.961
- Viola?
<i>- Dad, you called me yesterday.</i>

40:55.161 --> 40:56.361
Yes.

40:56.561 --> 41:00.161
<i>Can you help me with some Latin?
I need one more phrase:</i>

41:00.361 --> 41:04.161
<i>"Etiam periere ruinae",
what does it mean?</i>

41:04.361 --> 41:07.761
I don't know, Viola. I'm sorry.

41:08.961 --> 41:11.321
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- Yes.

41:11.521 --> 41:14.321
<i>- Mom told me you're going away.</i>
- No, not anymore.

41:14.521 --> 41:17.361
<i>Good! I have to go, bye.</i>

41:44.521 --> 41:46.961
<i>You have a new message.</i>

41:48.561 --> 41:50.761
<i>Pastore, it's Raffaella Grandi.</i>

41:50.961 --> 41:55.761
<i>A fter we spoke I got a call
from a man I didn't know.</i>

41:55.961 --> 42:00.961
<i>He told me to be careful,
I was scared and so I left work.</i>

42:01.161 --> 42:05.361
<i>Try to understand, I have 2 kids,
I didn't want to risk...</i>

42:06.561 --> 42:09.761
<i>I'm sorry, I didn 't call you
to justify myself.</i>

42:11.761 --> 42:14.161
<i>I checked again
and found something strange.</i>

42:14.361 --> 42:17.321
<i>Zenit issued a new purchase invoice
for some plasma</i>

42:17.521 --> 42:19.361
<i>it had bought 5 years ago.</i>

42:19.561 --> 42:23.161
<i>An accounting scam, to make it look
like that blood was new.</i>

42:25.641 --> 42:27.841
<i>It's being kept
in a refrigerator room.</i>

42:28.041 --> 42:29.841
<i>Officially, it belongs to Lemures,</i>

42:29.961 --> 42:33.961
<i>to prove Zenit will use it
we need to wait for it to be collected.</i>

42:34.161 --> 42:36.761
<i>You'll need to enter
the company storeroom.</i>

42:42.001 --> 42:44.441
<i>You realize what they're doing,
right?</i>

42:48.641 --> 42:52.361
<i>They're going to put more
contaminated blood on the market.</i>

44:00.241 --> 44:01.921
Ready?

44:03.001 --> 44:06.361
- What should I say?
- Improvise.

44:06.561 --> 44:09.761
We just need to see
if you look okay on video.

44:13.721 --> 44:15.761
Say anything.

44:34.281 --> 44:38.161
"There are people who don't believe
in anything from the day they're born.

44:38.361 --> 44:41.561
This doesn't stop these people
from acting,

44:41.761 --> 44:43.561
from making something of their lives,

44:43.761 --> 44:47.361
from doing and achieving something.

44:49.681 --> 44:53.561
Other people, instead,
have the habit of believing.

44:53.761 --> 44:58.361
Duties materialize before their eyes
as ideals to realize.

44:59.121 --> 45:02.601
If one fine day,
these people stop believing...

45:03.121 --> 45:05.161
maybe gradually over time...

45:06.361 --> 45:11.361
due to a logical or illogical
succession of disappointments,

45:11.561 --> 45:14.201
they then rediscover that void,

45:14.401 --> 45:17.561
which for others has always been
so natural.

45:19.761 --> 45:24.601
But their discovery of this void
brings with it new implications:

45:25.161 --> 45:30.161
not only the continuing
of their actions and their diligence,

45:30.361 --> 45:35.161
no longer considered as duties
but as gratuitous acts...

45:50.361 --> 45:53.201
But also the exhilarating sensation

45:53.721 --> 45:56.761
that all of this
is nothing more than...

45:59.361 --> 46:00.921
a game."

46:07.161 --> 46:10.721
NEXT TIME

46:22.041 --> 46:25.201
- You can't just do as you please.
- Will you take me back?
