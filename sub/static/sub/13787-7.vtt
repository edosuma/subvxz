from one base to another

12:29.707 --> 12:31.663

to the soldiers and...

12:33.545 --> 12:34.785
One night.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.962
I heard a soldier
negotiating price

12:39.092 --> 12:41.458
and the number
was getting really high.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.795

I was happy

12:46.182 --> 12:47.683

So that night.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.487
as soon as that soldier
fell asleep.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.830
I bashed him in the head
with a big rock and ran.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.829
When I ended up here.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.538
I acted high-class

13:20.300 --> 13:22.336

a job at the NeedWant.

I'm gonna marry
someone rich.
