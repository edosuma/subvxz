00:01.235 --> 00:03.071
We know you're hungry
for MasterChef.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.538
Nobody's safe
in this kitchen.

00:04.572 --> 00:06.740
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.009
-And check out
our other Fox programs--
-(audience cheering)

00:09.043 --> 00:11.079
Gordon Ramsay's
24 Hours to Hell and Back,

00:11.112 --> 00:13.247
Beat Shazam, and The Four.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.515
Challenge!

00:14.548 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.489
Narrator:
Tonight on "MasterChef"...

00:21.522 --> 00:23.057
Halibut.

00:23.091 --> 00:26.227
it's a Gordon Ramsay
master class...

00:26.260 --> 00:29.697
The way Gordon's moving,
just like a surgeon at work.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.700
- and only the sharpest
home cooks...
- Damn it!

00:32.733 --> 00:35.603
- Looks like it's been
mauled by a cat.
- ...will make the cut.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.771
This looks like trying
to clean a fish with an ax.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.440
Then, a shocking twist...

00:39.473 --> 00:42.210
Two more talented cooks
will be leaving.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.845
...shakes up
the MasterChef kitchen.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.215
That will happen right now.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.323
( music playing )

00:59.760 --> 01:02.363
Top 12! Yes!

01:02.396 --> 01:04.031
Emily:
I'm in the top 12
of "MasterChef."

01:04.064 --> 01:05.633
I never envisioned
that this would happen.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.236
Welcome, everyone!

01:08.269 --> 01:10.704
Emily:
Gordon's got five aprons left,
Aarón's got four,

01:10.738 --> 01:12.406
and Joe's down to three aprons.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.375
But I'm ready for top 10,
I'm ready for top five.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.144
I'm ready to represent Joe
in the finale.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.745
How's everyone doing?

01:17.778 --> 01:19.079
- Doing all right, Chef.
- Good.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.948
All right, guys,
your next challenge

01:20.981 --> 01:22.983
is what we call a skills test.

01:23.016 --> 01:26.654
- Oh!
- Tonight is all about
one unique protein.

01:26.687 --> 01:30.758
A truly versatile protein.

01:30.791 --> 01:34.895
It can be broiled,
baked, or grilled.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.998
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, no.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.500
Chelsea:
Where is he going?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.802
Aarón: Be worried.
It took four strong men

01:41.835 --> 01:44.172
just to tackle
that deadly beast.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.307
- Oh, no!
- ( laughs )

01:49.042 --> 01:50.511
- ( gasps )
- S.J.: Whoa!

01:50.544 --> 01:51.945
Shanika:
What the hell?

01:51.979 --> 01:53.247
- Oh!
- What is that?

01:53.281 --> 01:55.316
Shanika:
This is a big-ass fish.

01:55.349 --> 01:58.252
I have never seen a fish
this big in my entire life.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.754
I don't even know where the
hell they got that fish from.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.857
It looked like a dinosaur
or something, I don't know.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.926
- Look at it. Come on.
- Wow.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.529
Hundreds of dollars worth
of delicious,

02:08.562 --> 02:10.464
incredible, fresh halibut.

02:10.498 --> 02:14.368
- Wow.
- ( laughter )

02:14.402 --> 02:17.271
Tonight, each of you will
fillet an entire halibut,

02:17.305 --> 02:19.473
and portion it out evenly.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.343
This is a skill
I expect chefs in my kitchen

02:22.376 --> 02:24.312
to execute flawlessly.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.114
And now it's your turn
to master it,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.516
'cause I'm about
to show you how.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.783
- Yes!
- Okay?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.885
Watch carefully.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.054
Flat fish, one of the most
difficult fishes

02:34.087 --> 02:36.657
anywhere in the sea to fillet.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.860
First off, sharp knife.

02:39.893 --> 02:45.165
Halibut, it's got four fillets.
One, two, three, four.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.901
I'm gonna start the knife cut
from top of the head.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.037
Slice through.
Gently use the tip of the knife.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.540
Come down to the top,
and there's a line there

02:52.573 --> 02:54.575
that'll help guide
the center of the fillet.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.545
So, follow that line
to the tail,

02:57.578 --> 03:00.914
and then fingers down,
and then pry.

03:00.948 --> 03:04.352
Really important, make sure
you use the filleting knife.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.754
We need that flexibility
to go in and under.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.323
This really ensures
that you got a nice clean cut.

03:09.357 --> 03:12.192
Carefully slide the knife
across the bone.

03:12.226 --> 03:15.429
Hold the fillet down, off,
and let the knife do the work.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.931
- Oh, my God.
- And from there,
fillet number one.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.368
- Oh, my God!
- Wow! Amazing.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.837
Again, find that bone,
then come through.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.939
Again hold the knife
nice and flat, pull back,

03:25.973 --> 03:27.608
- and bend that knife.
- Oh, my gosh.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.777
- Fillet number two.
- Oh, my God.

03:29.810 --> 03:33.180
Now, turn it over.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.882
See that little
thin line there?

03:34.915 --> 03:37.851
That's the indication
where the actual middle bone is.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.753
Run your fingers down,

03:39.787 --> 03:42.790
and keep that knife
against the side of the bone.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.760
Just gently lift it up
and then off.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.029
- Again, clean.
- Oh, my gosh.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.798
A little bit more difficult,
this one,

03:50.831 --> 03:53.033
'cause it's so much thinner.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.736
Hardly any meat on
that tail part of the carcass.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.538
Carefully
pull the fillet back.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.040
Bend the knife,

04:00.073 --> 04:03.243
and then back down and off.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.446
- Fillet number four.
- Wow.

04:05.479 --> 04:09.149
- Oh, my God!
- Carcass nice and clean.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.619
I literally want to see
no flesh on there.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.287
Wow.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.889
Watching Gordon Ramsay fillet
this fish is amazing.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.291
And then we start our portions.

04:17.325 --> 04:20.060
- One.
- I'm seeing how precise he is,

04:20.093 --> 04:21.729
how much finesse he has.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.432
If he was in my class,
he'd have an A plus.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.167
I'm just hoping I can do it
as flawlessly as he can.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.103
And there we have 16 fillets.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.672
But we're not done yet.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.073
- Mm.
- The cheek.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.577
And this is what we call
the sort of oyster.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.613
Out. Beautiful, majestic.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.415
The cheek.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.784
Oh, my gosh.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.687
And that is how a MasterChef
fillets a halibut.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.955
- ( applause )
- Ready?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.256
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes, Chef.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.658
I have never been this close

04:50.691 --> 04:51.925
to a halibut in my life,

04:51.959 --> 04:54.495
but I have filleted
fish before.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.430
I wanna show off
my knife skills

04:56.464 --> 05:00.701
and show Gordon, my mentor,
that I can do this.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.703
You're gonna have
only 20 minutes

05:02.736 --> 05:05.205
to break down this halibut.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.442
We want even portions,
and it needs to be as clean

05:08.476 --> 05:11.144
and effortless
as Gordon's demonstration.

05:11.178 --> 05:14.848
If it's not up to our standard,
you will have to cook again

05:14.882 --> 05:16.517
in order to stay
in this competition.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.686
- Is that clear?
- All: Yes, Chef.

05:18.719 --> 05:22.055
Your 20 minutes starts...

05:22.089 --> 05:23.624
...now.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.325
- All right.
- Yeah.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.894
Got some speed on, y'all.
Come on, let's go.

05:28.396 --> 05:31.298
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, my goodness.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.634
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh!

05:33.667 --> 05:35.035
Chelsea:
This fish is huge.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.070
I mean, this is
the largest protein

05:37.104 --> 05:39.573
I've ever got to butcher
in my life.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.909
All of this pressure, it just
gives me so much anxiety.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.911
- I'm freaking out.
- Gordon: Let's go.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.079
This means so much to me
to get this right,

05:46.113 --> 05:48.749
and I don't wanna mess it up
for my teacher, Aarón.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.084
Gordon:
Halibut, one of the most
precious jewels from the sea.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.886
Yeah, even now
at my restaurants,

05:52.920 --> 05:55.556
I let only my sous-chefs
actually fillet fish.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.759
It's that important of a skill.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.094
It's not a fish that's gonna
be shredded and cooked,

06:01.128 --> 06:04.532
so the presentation
and how precise you are
with the knife is key.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.501
I can't find the-- the bone.
It's really hard.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.103
Joe:
Guys, this is a very,
very difficult challenge.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.906
- Can anyone actually get
through this perfectly?
- Gordon: Yeah.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.944
For me, the secret about
this skills test tonight
is that level of care,

06:16.977 --> 06:19.513
the way you handle,
the way you bend the fillets,
the way you bend the knife.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.381
- You can't tear this.
You can't puncture it.
- Aarón: Yeah.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.184
You can't rip it.
You gotta let the knife
do the work.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.954
It's like an operation.
It's precision beyond belief,

06:26.987 --> 06:30.123
and you know the yield from all
those four fillets is crucial.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.826
Whoo-wee.
This is hard.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.597
Guys, five minutes gone,
15 minutes to go.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.599
( panting )

06:39.800 --> 06:41.469
I'm pretty nervous right now.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.236
You know, usually I have
a lot of confidence,

06:43.270 --> 06:44.805
but I've never
filleted a fish.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.040
I live in Iowa.
We don't get fresh halibut,

06:47.074 --> 06:50.744
so I gotta stay focused and--
and really get going on this.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.213
I feel like because I'm one
of the younger ones here,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.483
I might be a little bit
underestimated in
this competition.

06:55.516 --> 06:59.119
I wanna show that I can really
come up with some great skills.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.555
My dad's actually a butcher,

07:01.589 --> 07:03.591
so I've picked up
a couple things from him.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.058
I've never filleted a fish
this large,

07:05.092 --> 07:06.660
so I'm just taking my time

07:06.694 --> 07:08.629
and making sure these fillets
come out beautiful.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.664
( sighs )

07:10.698 --> 07:12.132
The type of fish that we eat,

07:12.165 --> 07:14.234
you know, in Louisville,
Kentucky, are catfish

07:14.267 --> 07:16.003
and redfish,
those type of things,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.337
but never a flat fish.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.906
If I don't get
this fish right,

07:18.939 --> 07:20.474
then I'm going
into the elimination test.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.943
I've been in elimination
over and over again,

07:22.976 --> 07:24.945
but I-- I just wanna rest
for a day.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.614
I would love to be
on the balcony.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.416
Gordon:
Just coming up to halfway.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.118
Ten minutes to go.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.187
We should have
our fillets off by now.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.422
Let's go.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.257
Damn it!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.692
I'm massacring this fish.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.428
Oh, come on.
I've filleted fish before,

07:41.461 --> 07:44.031
but I wouldn't say
that it's something
that is in my wheelhouse

07:44.064 --> 07:46.767
or something that I am very,
very good at doing.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.836
Living in Wisconsin,
it's not an opportunity

07:48.869 --> 07:50.270
that I have a whole lot,

07:50.303 --> 07:52.506
is to cook and kill
and clean fish.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.676
So I'm down there
in the trenches with everybody
else today, I think.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.344
Okay, focus, focus.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.547
So, some impressive
performances out there.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.314
Gordon:
Yeah. Cesar.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.050
That guy's discipline
with a knife is extraordinary.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.052
There's still fish left
on the carcass.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.621
- ( panting )
- Chelsea, just breathe.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.189
- I'm trying.
- I know.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.824
I know it's hard.
Just breathe.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.826
- Chelsea's freaking out.
- Yeah.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.394
- Oh, what's wrong?
- Chelsea, I think
she's just struggling

08:14.427 --> 08:16.296
to get her head around
the size of this thing.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.831
Come on, Chelsea,
you've got this.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.634
- ( groans )
- Three minutes. Let's go!

08:20.668 --> 08:22.402
You've got to start
portioning, guys.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.471
Speed up. Let's go.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.641
Come on, Gerron, you got this.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.678
- Joe: Emily's look very good.
- Emily's look wonderful.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.212
Thing is,
will she finish in time?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.246
She's got one more big fillet
to clean there.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.181
And she has to get the oyster.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.549
Joe:
Emily, hurry up.

08:35.583 --> 08:39.152
Oh, there's some
of the tail left.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.255
We're looking
for perfection, precision,

08:42.289 --> 08:43.891
technique, finesse!

08:43.924 --> 08:45.192
Joe:
Don't forget those oysters.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.996
Gordon:
30 seconds remaining!

08:49.029 --> 08:50.864
( groans )

08:50.898 --> 08:52.399
Come on.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.002
Joe:
Let's go, guys.
Come on, come on!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.536
Gordon:
Let's go, guys.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.872
Oh, my God.
They're too small.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.109
Ten, nine, eight,

09:02.142 --> 09:04.912
seven, six, five,

09:04.945 --> 09:07.715
four, three, two, one.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.016
And stop!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.752
Hands in the air,
knives down.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.226
- Well done, all of you.
- ( exhales )

09:19.259 --> 09:22.295
That was a very difficult
skills challenge,

09:22.329 --> 09:24.431
breaking down
an entire halibut.

09:24.464 --> 09:28.001
Let's take a much closer look.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.473
Cesar.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.275
Have you done this before?

09:35.308 --> 09:36.810
I've done it
with smaller fish,

09:36.844 --> 09:38.411
but never something this size.

09:38.445 --> 09:42.115
This is a commanding
looking fish board.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.653
- Thank you.
- Let's check out
your fish carcass.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.554
- Okay. Wow.
- Man!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.056
Everyone,
take a look at this.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.558
This is a master class
in halibut filleting.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.060
It's perfect.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.662
It weighs nothing.
It's a feather.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.463
- Good job.
- Thank you, Joe.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.165
Good, good job.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.468
Okay, let's check out
the trimming bowls.

10:01.501 --> 10:05.605
You did leave some good
portions of fish.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.474
How many portions did you get?
Two, four, six, eight,

10:07.507 --> 10:08.809
10, 12, 20?

10:08.842 --> 10:11.078
Plus the cheek.
Nice portions.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.680
Very consistent.
I'm impressed.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.415
Aarón certainly has himself
an excellent student in you.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.685
- Good job, Cesar. Very good.
- Thank you, Joe.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.656
- Samantha.
- Chef.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.991
Let's have a look
at the carcass first.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.259
Um, it was really difficult.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.928
Not very good
visually there.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.697
This here starts to identify

10:29.730 --> 10:31.298
that you were ragged
with the knife.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.466
- It's all flaky.
- Yeah.

10:33.500 --> 10:38.605
And a lot of fish
left on the carcass.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.874
- And what happened here?
- I didn't get to those.

10:40.908 --> 10:41.942
- Dear, oh, dear.
- That one's just ripped.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.678
It's absolutely awful.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.379
Looks like it's been
mauled by a cat.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.449
- Yeah.
- Hole through there as well.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.551
Sloppy knife work,
big disappointment.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.453
Trimmings.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.855
Here's the other issue.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.224
Look how much fish
is left on that skin.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.658
Look how thick that is.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.129
Portion-wise,
little bit jagged.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.564
Little gash at the end.
And look how thin that is,

11:04.597 --> 11:06.133
because half this flesh

11:06.166 --> 11:07.467
from the fish is
left on the skin.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.169
- Yeah.
- Not good.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.771
Sorry, Chef.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.508
- Chelsea.
- Hi.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.177
You have one of my aprons.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.813
So, you looked
extremely flustered.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.414
Yeah, I was overwhelmed.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.150
I just really wanted
to do a good job,

11:23.183 --> 11:25.185
and I knew that I had left
some fish on the carcass.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.920
I was very disappointed
in myself.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.723
All right,
let's take a look
at the carcass.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.592
( sighs )

11:32.625 --> 11:35.929
Let me tell you, your demeanor
during that skills test

11:35.963 --> 11:38.065
does not necessarily show up
on the carcass.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.432
You did a pretty decent job.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.234
A couple bits here
that are left over,

11:41.268 --> 11:43.203
but as far as the center part,
it's good.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.039
- Okay.
- All right, let's look
at the trimmings.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.542
Yeah, here's where
I think you struggled.

11:49.576 --> 11:52.545
You took off a lot
of really usable parts.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.849
You probably have two more
portions of meat in there.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.285
- Okay.
- Considering all
of those miscues,

11:58.318 --> 12:00.453
there are some very beautiful
portions here,

12:00.487 --> 12:02.089
and you got the cheek.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.556
Look, Chelsea, you gotta

12:03.590 --> 12:05.392
really take care of
that confidence level,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.962
'cause that shows up
in all of your performance.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.964
So, please,
harness that anxiety

12:10.998 --> 12:13.633
- and turn it into
motivation, strength.
- Okay.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.636
- Okay.
- It's not perfect,
but good job.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.574
- Shanika.
- Yes, Chef.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.944
Let's take a look here
at the trimmings, shall we?

12:23.977 --> 12:25.645
Oh, Lord.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.614
Shanika, that's
not even one portion.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.716
It's like two or three.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.284
Hearing the feedback,

12:31.318 --> 12:32.786
I'm a little nervous as
they're walking around.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.254
They are judging critically.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.156
Farhan,
this is a disaster.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.158
You've left half the fish
on there. Not good.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.927
S.J., there's some
obvious gashes,

12:39.960 --> 12:41.594
and quite a fair
amount of meat.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.630
You know that's not
what we're looking for.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.265
They are not letting
anything slide.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.400
Gerron, what you did is
you took a beautiful fish

12:47.434 --> 12:50.237
and you made, effectively,
fish sticks.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.439
- Sad.
- If you were hacking away
at that fish

12:52.472 --> 12:54.441
or your cuts aren't concise...

12:54.474 --> 12:56.676
Bowen, not good. Okay?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.011
...they're gonna
call you out on it.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.147
Julia, look how much fish

13:00.180 --> 13:02.749
is left on the carcass there.
It's shocking.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.485
Taylor, you missed
the whole tail portion there.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.421
- Too bad.
- So I'm just going over
in my head

13:08.455 --> 13:10.623
what could I have done
differently or what could
I have done better.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.325
- I'm worried.
- Emily.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.027
- Yes, Chef.
- How was that
challenge for you

13:14.061 --> 13:16.096
- on a scale of one to 10?
- Probably a seven or eight.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.131
So, just visually,
looking at the carcass,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.001
it is as good as Cesar's.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.303
Immaculately done.
Let's have a look.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.305
Nice clean bones going
all the way through there,

13:25.338 --> 13:26.773
and also, it's not hacked.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.476
Really good.
Nice and light.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.311
Bowl of trimmings.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.148
Skin, perfect.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.483
These are like feathers.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.717
Joe:
Wow. Good job.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.552
Portion-wise,
they look beautiful.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.521
Textbook.
You've nailed it,
young lady.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.156
- Great job.
- Thank you.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.624
Emily, you can add
"fishmonger" to the resume.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.426
- I will.
- Gordon: Great job.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.829
- Okay, Ashley.
- Hi, Joe.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.564
What was the hardest part
of it for you?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.633
I just didn't wanna
hack it up.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.568
I really wanted to just
take my time

13:55.602 --> 13:56.836
and at least get
as much meat off,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.238
like a really smooth fillet.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.173
I mean, this is the most
fundamental cut of all,

14:00.207 --> 14:02.042
and you just
totally missed it.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.911
- There's six ounces
of meat there.
- More.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.645
That's a--
that's a shame.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.416
- It is.
- Right back there.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.784
Let's see,
what do we got in here?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.821
Where-- where--

14:14.854 --> 14:16.356
Missing something.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.191
Where's the skin
that you took
off the fillets?

14:18.225 --> 14:21.394
I didn't get the skin
off the fillets.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.263
Wait a second.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.398
Yeah.

14:25.432 --> 14:30.203
Did you just not even listen
to what we asked you to do?

14:36.443 --> 14:38.912
Wait a second.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.651
Did you just not even listen
to what we asked you to do?

14:46.419 --> 14:49.389
I wanted to make sure
I got portions on there and--

14:49.422 --> 14:52.059
You gave us eight portions.
They're all unusable.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.694
You just took a fish that's
worth several hundred dollars

14:54.727 --> 14:56.629
and destroyed it
and did not give us
one portion.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.432
- Zero.
- ( sighs )

14:59.466 --> 15:01.768
That's a-- that's a shame.
Extremely disappointing.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.103
I thought you were
a better student.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.439
You are in trouble.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.075
Gordon:
What a shame.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.110
I'm crushed on the inside.

15:10.143 --> 15:14.814
I've let the judges down,
especially Gordon, my mentor.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.549
All of you, walk down
to the front, please.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.386
Ashley:
And to feel like
I disappointed him

15:19.419 --> 15:21.154
is heartbreaking.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.922
Tough challenge tonight,

15:22.956 --> 15:25.892
but some of you did us proud,
let's get that right.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.827
You actually paid attention,

15:27.860 --> 15:31.131
and being able to learn
a lesson quickly is critical

15:31.164 --> 15:33.400
if you wanna become
America's next MasterChef.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.004
As your mentors,
that is an essential talent
that we are looking for.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.839
Aarón:
There are two of you
that did not just do a good job,

15:39.872 --> 15:41.474
but did an exceptional job.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.013
Emily.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.214
Cesar.

15:49.216 --> 15:52.019
Emily, Cesar,
great job, you two.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.153
You're safe from elimination.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.621
Please,
head up to the balcony.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.424
Thank you.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.692
My heart is swelling
with pride.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.628
The judges' critiques
just validated

16:01.661 --> 16:03.630
that confidence in myself.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.598
I hope I make Chef Aarón proud,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.367
and I'm just happy
to have another opportunity

16:07.400 --> 16:09.702
to prove
that I'm meant to be here.

16:09.736 --> 16:13.640
Now, you 10,
you'll all be cooking

16:13.673 --> 16:16.176
in tonight's elimination test.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.280
But now,
with this next challenge,

16:20.313 --> 16:24.117
you've got a chance
to redeem yourselves.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.019
And guess what you'll be
cooking with tonight?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.287
All:
Halibut.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.555
Joe:
That's right.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.558
Halibut is an incredible
fish to work with.

16:31.591 --> 16:35.662
It's flaky, and dense,
yet delicate.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.031
Uses for halibut
are endless.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.034
- For sure.
- Now tonight, we want you
to take that halibut

16:41.068 --> 16:43.870
that you worked with earlier
and transform that

16:43.903 --> 16:47.340
into an incredible
"MasterChef"-worthy dish.

16:47.374 --> 16:51.544
We are giving you total freedom
to make anything you want

16:51.578 --> 16:56.383
as long as you make that halibut
the star of your dish.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.850
All:
Yes, Chef.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.920
You have access
to the most amazing pantry.

17:00.953 --> 17:05.024
Alongside that,
you've got the best equipment
any chef can dream of--

17:05.058 --> 17:08.428
Viking stoves that are
a dream to work and cook on.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.896
Use it to your advantage.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.698
All:
Yes, Chef.

17:11.731 --> 17:15.368
A reminder, at least one of you
will be going home tonight.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.537
You have 45 minutes
on the clock.

17:17.570 --> 17:21.208
Your 45 minutes start...

17:22.609 --> 17:23.776
- ...now.
- Come on.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.512
- Come on, guys!
- Go, go, go!

17:25.545 --> 17:27.447
- Emily: Go!
- Cesar: Run!

17:27.480 --> 17:29.116
Holy--

17:29.149 --> 17:30.550
Right behind you.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.752
( muttering )

17:32.785 --> 17:34.020
Nutmeg, nutmeg.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.255
Where are the carrots?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.790
Are there carrots anywhere?

17:37.824 --> 17:39.859
This is my chance to redeem
myself for my fillet,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.129
and I need to show the judges

17:42.162 --> 17:43.896
that I have a lot more
in my repertoire.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.266
Soy sauce.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.468
So tonight I'm making
a grilled halibut

17:48.501 --> 17:50.370
over roasted Brussels sprouts
and asparagus,

17:50.403 --> 17:53.906
carrot and ginger purée,
with an Asian sauce.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.744
Gordon:
Let's go! Please!

17:57.777 --> 17:59.946
Go, guys.
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.215
- Emily: You got this, guys.
- Gordon: Let's go!

18:02.249 --> 18:03.450
Look at Farhan.
Oh, my God.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.618
He took the entire
spice cabinet.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.287
He's the OG spice boy.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.956
So, that was probably
the most difficult skill test

18:09.989 --> 18:12.892
we ever presented
to "MasterChef" contestants.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.328
- I don't know what to do.
- Joe: What's interesting is

18:15.362 --> 18:16.796
they're gonna have to cook

18:16.829 --> 18:18.431
with what they left
on the board,

18:18.465 --> 18:21.134
so they're gonna have to deal
with the results

18:21.168 --> 18:23.170
- of their filleting skills.
- That looks good.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.773
Which is a challenge,
because not everyone got
the perfect fillets.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.908
Cesar:
I wonder if she's gonna
take the skin off or not.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.143
She better.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.778
The top ten is
around the corner,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.746
so tonight, we wanna see
finesse on the plate.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.749
We wanna see some of
those magical ingredients
from that pantry

18:36.783 --> 18:39.819
utilized across
this incredible halibut.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.087
Perfect.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.622
I wanna see big, bold flavors.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.292
I wanna see creativity.
I wanna see spice.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.626
Tastes good.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.695
Joe:
This is a restaurant
quality protein.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.263
This is not a kind of fish
you cook at home
every night.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.166
I wanna see these home cooks
take this halibut

18:53.200 --> 18:56.469
and put it on a plate that
I can sell for 40 or 50 bucks.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.306
Yep.
Just over 35 minutes to go.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.178
- What's Sam doing?
- She's working
with, like, mushrooms.

19:05.212 --> 19:08.014
Today I'm going to be doing
a pan-seared halibut

19:08.047 --> 19:10.317
on top of a mushroom risotto,

19:10.350 --> 19:12.619
with a sun-dried tomato pesto.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.188
I have no experience
cooking with halibut,

19:15.222 --> 19:17.123
but I've been doing my studying,
I've been doing research,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.992
so hopefully I can knock
this one out of the park.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.829
- Samantha's doing a risotto.
- Ooh!

19:22.862 --> 19:27.400
I am making a pan-seared halibut
with a fennel salad.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.901
It's gonna have
a brown butter vinaigrette,

19:28.935 --> 19:30.503
and then I'm gonna do
an avocado purée.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.138
And I have to
prove myself today

19:32.171 --> 19:34.507
because I totally
massacred that fish,

19:34.541 --> 19:37.109
and I am more disappointed
in myself probably
than the judges are.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.313
Aarón:
Let's go, Gerron. Come on.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.148
I'm making a pan-seared halibut

19:42.181 --> 19:45.518
with white sweet potatoes,
spinach, and onions.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.820
I'm making this dish
because I love sweet potatoes.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.522
They're my absolute favorite,

19:49.556 --> 19:51.658
but I've never
had halibut before,

19:51.691 --> 19:53.593
so I'm just hoping that those
flavors go good all together.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.762
Keep hustling, Gerron.
Whoo!

19:57.364 --> 19:58.665
Good hustle, Chelsea.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.199
Chelsea.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.668
- Yes, Chef.
- What's the dish?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.870
So I'm gonna do a kind of
Thai-inspired dish,

20:03.903 --> 20:06.105
since I've got
to travel to Thailand.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.174
And I'm going to do
a Thai red curry

20:08.207 --> 20:10.543
with, like, a cucumber yogurt
to lighten it up,

20:10.577 --> 20:12.745
'cause I want it to be spicy,
with bok choy,

20:12.779 --> 20:14.914
and, of course,
a pan-seared,
beautiful halibut.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.517
Now, that wasn't
the perfect butchering.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.186
- I was expecting more of you.
- I'm very disappointed
that I let my nerves get me

20:20.219 --> 20:22.389
and I am not gonna let
that happen again.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.024
- Let's hope you come back
strong with this dish. Right?
- Yes, absolutely.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.293
I'm definitely gonna
make up for this.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.295
- 100%, Chef.
- Good luck.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.701
All right, Farhan.
So what's the dish?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.969
I'm making cauliflower couscous
with an herb roasted halibut.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.238
You're using the carcass. Amen.
You're making a stock?

20:39.272 --> 20:40.573
- Yes.
- Thank God.
What's in the stock?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.141
So, it's fennel,
lime leaves,

20:42.174 --> 20:44.076
cipollini onion,
chile de arbol,

20:44.110 --> 20:45.478
I guess the spine
of the fish

20:45.512 --> 20:47.046
to make sure I got some
nice fattiness from it.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.349
( coughs )

20:50.450 --> 20:52.251
This sauce,
all I taste is heat.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.054
Taste that sauce.
You tell me what
the problem is.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.324
- It's really spicy right now.
- It's really spicy.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.726
Everything that's a problem
with you in this kitchen
is in that sauce.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.060
You're just
so over-spiced.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.762
Season it right now
properly.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.263
Otherwise, guess
where you're going.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.498
Home.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.139
Taste that sauce.
You tell me what
the problem is.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.442
- It's really spicy right now.
- It's really spicy.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.010
Everything that's a problem
with you in this kitchen
is in that sauce.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.779
- Okay.
- You're just so over-spiced.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.448
Season it right now
properly.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.949
Otherwise, guess
where you're going.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.618
Home. Heard.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.256
- Right, S.J.
Tell me about the dish.
- Yes, Chef.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.992
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to be doing
a pan-seared halibut

21:33.025 --> 21:35.161
with a Parisian gnocchi,
pickled pear salad,

21:35.194 --> 21:36.596
and a pancetta
leek cream sauce.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.831
- You're making gnocchi.
- Yes, Chef.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.000
Potato-based, flour-based?

21:41.033 --> 21:43.370
- Flour-based.
- Wow. I mean, it sounds
super complicated.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.839
Absolutely. You know,
I'm really doing my best
to really go out there,

21:46.873 --> 21:49.108
because I know lately I've been
playing it fairly safe,

21:49.141 --> 21:52.111
and I really don't wanna
be sent home because
I didn't really try my best.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.847
But, you know, I'm confident.
You know I got into this
competition by cooking fish,

21:54.881 --> 21:56.883
so I think I can do it
one more time.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.352
Yeah, I gave you that apron
and I believe in you.

21:59.386 --> 22:02.522
- Good luck.
Taste everything, yes?
- Yes, Chef.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.324
Let's do this.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.993
All right, so, Ashley,
talk to me about your dish.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.161
I lived in France
for a year,

22:09.195 --> 22:11.364
so I am going
for those French memories.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.065
I have my Parisian
gnocchi batter,

22:13.099 --> 22:17.470
and then I am going to pan-sear
the halibut and some spinach.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.572
Ashley, you've had some issues
with time management.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.241
- Okay? So I need you
to really step up
- Yes, Chef.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.843
and segment all the steps
of your dish.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.177
- Okay?
- Heard, Chef.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.846
- All right.
- I'm so excited

22:26.879 --> 22:29.382
- to see these
Parisian gnocchi.
- Yeah.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.884
The pâte à choux dough
is so easy, and that's
so much quicker

22:31.918 --> 22:33.252
- than cooking potatoes.
- Right.

22:33.285 --> 22:36.456
Four minutes remaining.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.359
It's starting to get hot
in here.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.361
Samantha, the youngest,
wearing my pin.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.196
She's making a wild
mushroom risotto.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.833
Joe:
One of the few fish that can
take mushrooms is halibut.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.736
- There you go.
- One of the smartest dishes
I've heard. Super ambitious.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.771
I hope she can get it done.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.042
- No! It broke.
- So, Chelsea I'm really
worried about,

22:56.075 --> 22:59.045
because she's doing
an Asian style curry,

22:59.078 --> 23:00.913
she's making a broth,

23:00.947 --> 23:03.550
but then she's doing, like,
a cucumber cooling down raita.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.785
But you don't put yogurt
into a broth.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.720
- Absolutely.
- So, a little bit strange.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.955
It doesn't sound right.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.757
Aarón:
She's wearing my apron.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.792
- I'm really concerned.
- Oh, no, no, no.
None of that.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.428
Two minutes to go.
Come on.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.197
Fish needs to be frying now.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.267
Gordon:
Why does Ashley leave it all
to the last minute again?

23:21.300 --> 23:23.302
Last hustle, guys.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.707
- Aarón: Let's go!
- 60 seconds to go.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.643
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ashley, plate!

23:30.677 --> 23:31.978
Okay.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.813
Cesar:
Oh, man, this is
so nerve-racking.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.816
- Gordon:
15 seconds remaining.
- Oh, my God.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.889
- Joe: 10 seconds. 10 seconds.
- Judges: Ten, nine, eight,

23:42.922 --> 23:46.626
seven, six, five, four,

23:46.659 --> 23:49.395
three, two, one.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.263
- Gordon: Stop!
- Aarón: That's it.
Hands in the air.

23:51.297 --> 23:54.100
- Wow!
- Holy schnikes!

23:55.702 --> 23:58.270
Now, that was a very,
very difficult challenge,

23:58.304 --> 24:01.741
cooking with halibut.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.812
A reminder,
at least one of you will
be going home tonight.

24:05.845 --> 24:09.616
Right. First up, Samantha,
please. Thank you.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.818
Samantha:
This is my first time
cooking halibut,

24:11.851 --> 24:14.086
and I feel like I cooked it
really well.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.688
I'm proud of the color.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.591
It's got a nice
crispy exterior,

24:18.625 --> 24:21.127
and hopefully
this will show the judges

24:21.160 --> 24:23.462
that I am deserving
of that top 10 title.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.935
Samantha, describe
the dish, please.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.538
So, today I have
a pan-seared halibut

24:31.571 --> 24:34.106
topped with a sun-dried
tomato pesto

24:34.140 --> 24:36.776
on a bed
of mushroom risotto.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.779
- Why risotto?
- Risotto's supposed
to be creamy,

24:39.812 --> 24:41.347
and there's kind of
a buttery feel to it,

24:41.380 --> 24:43.550
and I thought that would
pair well with the halibut.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.185
When you look at that risotto,
what does it tell you?

24:48.054 --> 24:49.321
It's undercooked.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.691
When that center
of that arborio rice

24:51.724 --> 24:54.794
is still bright white,
it's like a filling
in your tooth.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.363
It's gonna be crunchy
as anything.

24:57.396 --> 25:00.399
But, fish,
you seared it beautifully.

25:00.432 --> 25:01.901
- Really beautiful sear
on there.
- Thank you.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.570
What's in the pesto?

25:03.603 --> 25:06.673
It is sun-dried tomatoes,
olive oil,

25:06.706 --> 25:09.175
some toasted pine nuts,
and some basil.

25:09.208 --> 25:12.979
So, the pesto's way too rich
and oily.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.815
- Okay.
- And it sort of
macerates the fish

25:15.848 --> 25:17.884
in a way that it sort of
damages the taste.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.354
I fight for you every night
in this kitchen,

25:22.388 --> 25:26.525
but I'm worried because
that risotto is undercooked.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.895
Sorry, Chef.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.705
You know, I think there's
way too much pesto.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.340
It's a very aggressive
seasoning with such
a delicate fish.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.543
It needs acid,
it needs herbs.

25:44.577 --> 25:47.213
I do like the idea
of a risotto.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.683
I think maybe with pumpkin
or squash, you would've
had a home run.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.184
There's just many
different directions

25:52.218 --> 25:53.519
that weren't taken
on this dish.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.787
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sorry.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.923
Ouch.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.858
Samantha:
I'm just starting
to mentally pack my bags.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.093
I'm terrified right now.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.695
I mean, this could be
my last time in this kitchen.

26:02.729 --> 26:06.933
Next up, wearing one
of Aarón's aprons,

26:06.966 --> 26:09.602
please step forward, Farhan.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.070
Farhan:
You know, I had bumps
along the way

26:11.103 --> 26:13.606
with having to start
over my sauce,

26:13.640 --> 26:15.541
but I love showing
my heritage on a plate.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.777
So I made a brand-new sauce

26:17.810 --> 26:19.245
that tastes just as good
as the old one,

26:19.278 --> 26:21.280
minus some of the spice
and the heat.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.282
I just hope that this choice
doesn't come back to bite me.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.317
All right, Farhan.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.754
I told you I thought
all the seasoning was off.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.088
I assume you fixed
all the seasoning?

26:29.121 --> 26:30.757
- I hope so.
- What's the dish?

26:30.790 --> 26:33.159
So it's an
oven-roasted halibut

26:33.192 --> 26:37.063
with a herb marinade
and a cauliflower couscous

26:37.096 --> 26:38.831
in a coconut
lemongrass sauce.

26:38.865 --> 26:41.734
The way I really enjoy
eating fish is in the tandoor,

26:41.768 --> 26:43.335
so I tried to mimic that
as best I could.

26:43.369 --> 26:46.272
So, cranked the oven
up to 500

26:46.305 --> 26:47.940
and left the fish in there
to really broil it.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.743
So this fillet of halibut
never saw a pan.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.411
- No, it never saw a pan.
- That's risky.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.715
- Let's take a look.
- ( sighs )

27:04.123 --> 27:05.524
( sniffs )

27:20.472 --> 27:21.473
Wow.

27:26.545 --> 27:27.847
I assume you fixed
all the seasoning?

27:27.880 --> 27:29.882
- I hope so.
- Let's take a look.

27:36.723 --> 27:37.957
Wow.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.292
That's a lot, Farhan.

27:40.326 --> 27:44.831
Where to begin? Um...

27:44.864 --> 27:48.835
this is the perfection
of length of flavor,

27:48.868 --> 27:50.036
because it begins
in the front,

27:50.069 --> 27:52.038
the heat goes down the side,

27:52.071 --> 27:53.339
sweetness is in the middle
of the tongue.

27:53.372 --> 27:54.673
It's the kind of sauce

27:54.707 --> 27:56.675
that is so provocative
to your palate,

27:56.709 --> 28:00.079
because it fires every aspect
of your tastebuds.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.849
Sweet, sour,
salty, savory.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.751
Thank you.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.286
The cook on the fish
is a triumph.

28:10.056 --> 28:13.592
It's flaky, it's light.
That is on another level.

28:13.625 --> 28:17.663
You are taking your ability
and sensibility with spice

28:17.696 --> 28:19.398
and beginning to understand

28:19.431 --> 28:21.200
- basic fundamentals
of cooking.
- Thank you.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.569
And that is a one-two punch

28:23.602 --> 28:26.238
that'll knock out a lot of
contenders in this kitchen.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.540
- Thank you.
- Good job.

28:28.574 --> 28:29.776
What's on top of the fish?

28:29.809 --> 28:32.244
Basil, some mint,
and cilantro.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.081
How many times have
I told you? It's "bah-sil."

28:36.448 --> 28:41.187
Mmm. Delicious.
Fish cooked beautifully.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.755
I'm just so pleased

28:42.789 --> 28:44.791
that you can remain a threat
in this competition

28:44.824 --> 28:46.759
and stay close
to your heritage.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.928
- It's a really good dish.
Great job.
- Thank you.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.931
- ( applause )
- Yes! Good job, Farhan.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.937
Next up, S.J., being mentored
by myself. Let's go.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.306
I really tried to
do something completely out
of my comfort zone

29:00.339 --> 29:02.374
by having all of these
different elements,

29:02.408 --> 29:04.210
and just trying
to really wow the judges,

29:04.243 --> 29:06.645
so I really hope the judges
can see that I've been learning

29:06.678 --> 29:08.414
and progressing
in this competition.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.950
- S.J. Describe
your halibut dish.
- Yes, Chef.

29:10.983 --> 29:15.421
It is a pan-seared halibut
with Parisian gnocchi,

29:15.454 --> 29:18.958
a pancetta leek cream sauce
with pickled pears.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.994
Okay, so, visually,
it looks like you've
over-seared it.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.630
And then you turn it over,

29:24.663 --> 29:27.900
and it's actually worse.

29:27.934 --> 29:31.737
Why the leek cream sauce
with the pickle?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.740
I thought that
because the cream sauce
was really rich,

29:34.773 --> 29:37.743
- I wanted to kind of cut that
with the pickled pears.
- Mm-hmm.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.446
So, one thing you have
got right here is
the amount of acid.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.349
The pickling goes well
with the halibut,

29:43.382 --> 29:45.517
but then the fish is
way overcooked.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.254
I'm confused--
the way you work
and what you finished with.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.456
Because you start off
with all the right intentions

29:50.489 --> 29:53.292
and then you hit a brick wall
and it all falls to ( bleep ).

29:53.325 --> 29:56.628
And I know you can cook
better than this.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.397
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

30:05.737 --> 30:08.374
S.J., this dish is
all over the place, man.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.378
That gnocchi needs to be coated
and developed in the sauce

30:12.411 --> 30:14.981
so it actually has some moisture
and retains some flavor.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.483
It's just overcooked
dry flour.

30:17.516 --> 30:21.053
And then you have overkill
on the pancetta, so it's salty.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.722
And then you have some pickles
trying to save the day,

30:23.755 --> 30:27.159
and these are just ideas
that don't make any sense.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.829
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, Chef.

30:32.331 --> 30:36.802
Joe: Next up, one of
my home cooks, Shanika.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.138
This dish is everything
that I am.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.373
It is colorful, it is sexy,

30:41.407 --> 30:45.077
and I feel like this is gonna
get me out of that doghouse

30:45.111 --> 30:48.680
from totally massacring
that poor halibut.

30:48.714 --> 30:52.084
- What did you make for us?
- It is a pan-seared halibut

30:52.118 --> 30:56.522
on a fennel salad that has
a brown butter vinaigrette

30:56.555 --> 30:58.424
with blood orange
and Meyer lemon.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.529
And the dish is just
like I expected.

31:03.562 --> 31:04.997
It's perfectly
cooked halibut.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.899
It's seasoned well.
It's spot-on.

31:06.933 --> 31:10.836
The flavor profile of all these
citrus components is classic.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.271
You found your place
in the kitchen,

31:12.304 --> 31:13.772
you found your place
with your ingredients.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.042
You make it your own
and it all makes sense.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.110
- Thank you, Shanika.
- Thank you, Joe.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.379
Next up,
being mentored by myself,

31:20.412 --> 31:22.949
Taylor, please.
Thank you.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.917
Taylor, describe the dish,
please.

31:24.951 --> 31:28.955
I have a grilled halibut
over roasted asparagus

31:28.988 --> 31:33.425
and Brussels over
a carrot and ginger purée.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.028
Grilling the fish,
I like the idea.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.397
It's actually cooked
beautifully in the center,

31:38.430 --> 31:41.633
but the grainy purée and...

31:41.667 --> 31:43.569
undercooked sprouts.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.304
You've got
all the elements of a dish

31:45.337 --> 31:47.773
that could've absolutely
sung beautifully tonight,

31:47.806 --> 31:51.310
but you continue to put
the mistakes on the plate.

31:51.343 --> 31:55.081
- Thank you, Chef.
- Next, step forward, Gerron.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.083
Talk to me
about the dish.

31:57.116 --> 32:00.619
Pan-seared halibut on a bed
of spinach and onions,

32:00.652 --> 32:03.122
a white sweet potato purée,

32:03.155 --> 32:05.124
and a roasted
red pepper coulis.

32:08.694 --> 32:11.964
The cook on the halibut
is superb.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.100
The red pepper coulis,
it's developed,

32:14.133 --> 32:15.901
'cause you roasted it
hard in the oven.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.237
Your purée, it's light,
it's airy.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.273
This is what
this competition is about--
seeing your growth.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.508
Joe gave you that apron
for a reason.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.610
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.145
- Good job, Gerron.
- Good job.

32:27.846 --> 32:30.016
Next up,
wearing Aarón's apron,

32:30.049 --> 32:31.617
Chelsea. Come on up.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.987
I'm so embarrassed
by how flustered I got

32:35.021 --> 32:36.622
when I was filleting
the halibut

32:36.655 --> 32:38.324
that I want this dish
to prove to the judges

32:38.357 --> 32:40.426
that I am confident,
and that I can cook,

32:40.459 --> 32:43.195
and I deserve to be here.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.963
- So, Chelsea, nice plating.
- Thank you.

32:44.997 --> 32:47.966
- What's the dish?
- I did a pan-seared halibut

32:48.000 --> 32:51.103
with a yogurt
and cucumber raita,

32:51.137 --> 32:55.841
with sautéed bok choy and
a Thai coconut curry sauce.

32:55.874 --> 32:58.677
- So when I cut it open,
how should it look inside?
- I hope it's really shiny

32:58.710 --> 33:01.547
- and cooked properly
and pretty.
- Let's see.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.183
- How's that look?
- ( sighs )

33:04.216 --> 33:05.784
It looks a little under.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.953
Yeah. It's still got
some blood in it.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.689
- Oh, no.
- That's too bad.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.459
- Tell me about this curry.
- I did curry paste

33:13.492 --> 33:16.028
and I put it in the mortar
and pestle with garlic
and peppercorn.

33:16.062 --> 33:19.665
- ( coughs )
- Is it too-- I didn't want
it to be too spicy.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.667
Yeah, it's like eating
a peanut butter cup

33:21.700 --> 33:24.136
- on the front of your palate,
- Okay.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.472
and just getting punched
in the back of your throat
with white heat.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.341
There's not nearly
enough salt.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.344
- Yeah.
- One throw of salt would
pull all that together.

33:32.378 --> 33:34.246
You're kind of off the rails
on your seasoning.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.582
Like, we're getting
to a point now
in the top 12,

33:36.615 --> 33:39.385
you got to have the palate
to be able to season.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.254
- Okay.
- Very, very big seasoning
errors here.

33:42.288 --> 33:44.590
- ( silverware clatters )
- Plate's almost inedible.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.832
You know, it's a bit weird
to have that warm yogurt
with the cucumber

33:53.865 --> 33:56.702
- in amongst
that pool of curry.
- Okay.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.238
The curry itself is
way too rich,

33:59.271 --> 34:00.839
because it's just so hot

34:00.872 --> 34:02.208
'cause it hasn't had chance
to cook out.

34:02.241 --> 34:05.177
But, plating's beautiful.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.946
I just don't think
that tonight has been
your night overall.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.648
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.619
Next is a home cook

34:13.652 --> 34:15.221
that's wearing one
of Gordon's aprons.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.523
Ashley, please step forward.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.925
So it came down
to the very last seconds

34:19.958 --> 34:22.060
for me to plate this dish.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.096
I know I've cut it
close before,

34:24.130 --> 34:27.299
but I hope the judges
still see finesse on the plate

34:27.333 --> 34:29.101
and it tastes good.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.036
Ashley, all right,

34:31.069 --> 34:32.738
well, how would you
describe the dish?

34:32.771 --> 34:36.542
This is a pan-seared halibut
with creamed spinach

34:36.575 --> 34:38.744
and gnocchi
à la Parisienne.

34:38.777 --> 34:39.945
All right,
well, first of all,

34:39.978 --> 34:41.613
it doesn't look like

34:41.647 --> 34:43.081
you had just under
a minute to plate that.

34:43.115 --> 34:45.384
- It looks wonderful.
- Thank you.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.453
Let's see how it tastes.
Are you happy with the cook?

34:47.486 --> 34:48.720
I am.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.021
( exhales )

34:51.490 --> 34:53.292
What do you think?

34:53.325 --> 34:56.362
It looks good to me, Chef.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.432
It doesn't look good to me.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.241
Let's see how it tastes.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.842
Are you happy with the cook?

35:10.876 --> 35:12.010
I am.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.379
( exhales )

35:14.713 --> 35:15.981
What do you think?

35:16.014 --> 35:18.617
It looks good to me, Chef.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.652
It doesn't look good to me.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.757
It looks perfect.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.293
( exhales )

35:30.629 --> 35:32.331
Unbelievable.

35:32.364 --> 35:35.467
When you say you were going
to Paris with this,

35:35.501 --> 35:38.136
I can just taste
that French sensibility

35:38.170 --> 35:41.207
with the spinach,
and that wonderful
gnocchi lightly cooked.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.941
They're airy,
they're very pillowy soft.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.545
I think that the cook
on the halibut is textbook.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.013
It's balanced
with the lemon.

35:48.046 --> 35:49.648
( whispers )
That's so good.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.818
The execution of this dish,
it is just unreal.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.886
And I know you're
wearing Gordon's apron,

35:54.920 --> 35:57.055
and I know he speaks French,

35:57.088 --> 35:59.225
but if you're gonna go to Paris
and cook like this,

35:59.258 --> 36:02.027
- can I go with you?
- ( laughs ) Yes!

36:02.060 --> 36:03.729
'Cause this is
unbelievable.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.665
- Thank you!
- ( applause )

36:06.698 --> 36:08.200
I am elated.

36:08.234 --> 36:09.868
Nice job, Ashley.

36:09.901 --> 36:14.840
I was recognized
for something I put together

36:14.873 --> 36:16.808
with seconds left.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.511
But the technique was there.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.947
This smile is not
gonna go away any time soon.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.654
That was a very intriguing
challenge.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.590
Some of you really,
really excelled,

36:31.623 --> 36:34.726
and some of you
are in trouble.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.863
But there was one dish

36:37.896 --> 36:40.866
that really
blew us away tonight.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.868
Congratulations...

36:42.901 --> 36:44.570
- Farhan.
- Thank you.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.539
( applause )

36:47.573 --> 36:51.443
We're on the search
across America

36:51.477 --> 36:53.612
for only one MasterChef.

36:53.645 --> 36:58.950
Unfortunately,
that means somebody is
leaving very shortly.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.588
If I call your name,
then please, make your way
down to the front.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.891
Chelsea,

37:05.924 --> 37:07.125
Samantha,

37:07.158 --> 37:08.694
S.J.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.562
I'm not ready to go home,

37:10.596 --> 37:12.698
because there's so much more
that I wanna show the judges.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.032
I haven't even had the chance

37:14.065 --> 37:16.067
to show off my heritage
and my culture.

37:16.101 --> 37:17.903
Everybody else,
congratulations.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.272
Please head up to
the safety of the balcony.

37:20.306 --> 37:23.174
If I get eliminated right now,
it'll break my heart.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.980
It was a tough night.
Many home cooks excelled.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.982
You three,
unfortunately, did not.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.787
Please, step forward...

37:38.324 --> 37:39.958
Chelsea.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.295
Chelsea, you made some
mistakes tonight,

37:43.329 --> 37:44.663
and as we move forward,

37:44.696 --> 37:47.733
there's no room
for basic errors.

37:47.766 --> 37:48.767
And for that reason,

37:48.800 --> 37:51.303
tonight, Chelsea,

37:51.337 --> 37:54.139
you...

37:54.172 --> 37:57.175
are going...

37:57.208 --> 37:58.444
...home.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.482
You made some
fundamental errors--

38:03.515 --> 38:06.752
under-seasoning,
didn't listen to direction,

38:06.785 --> 38:09.321
errors that eventually
will trip you up here

38:09.355 --> 38:11.156
in the MasterChef kitchen.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.325
Chelsea,
please leave your apron

38:13.359 --> 38:14.926
at your station,
and good night.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.127
Okay.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.763
( applause )

38:17.796 --> 38:18.964
Julia:
Love you, Chelsea.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.099
I'm disappointed,

38:21.132 --> 38:23.134
but the reason I came
to "MasterChef" was to learn,

38:23.168 --> 38:25.203
and to cook, and be able to
go into that kitchen,

38:25.236 --> 38:27.038
and I got to do
all of those things.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.874
Bye, guys.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.842
When I first came into
this MasterChef kitchen,

38:30.876 --> 38:32.978
I didn't have the confidence
that I do now,

38:33.011 --> 38:35.581
and I know that my skill level
has definitely increased.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.384
Bye, Chelsea.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.885
But, I mean,
I'll keep studying

38:39.918 --> 38:41.387
and I'll keep pursuing
my dreams,

38:41.420 --> 38:42.854
so nothing will stop me,
you know?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.022
I'm gonna always keep cooking.

38:50.195 --> 38:54.065
Now, we're down to the top 11.

38:54.099 --> 38:57.369
Next will be the top 10.

38:57.403 --> 39:01.873
That's when this competition
really takes off.

39:01.907 --> 39:04.476
And that milestone

39:04.510 --> 39:05.911
will happen

39:05.944 --> 39:07.345
right now.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.718
But more importantly for me,

39:12.751 --> 39:16.021
you're both wearing my apron,

39:16.054 --> 39:21.393
and so this pains me
to send one of you home.

39:21.427 --> 39:25.531
Samantha, your dish
was somewhat unfinished.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.565
S.J., you bounced around.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.867
You're all over the place.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.101
Let me get straight
to the point.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.770
This is hard enough
as it is for me.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.205
Samantha...

39:34.239 --> 39:35.874
you are going...

39:35.907 --> 39:37.976
( exhales )

39:39.445 --> 39:41.346
...up to the balcony.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.081
Say goodbye to S.J.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.417
( whispers )
Congrats.

39:45.451 --> 39:47.619
Good job.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.255
Samantha:
I am so relieved.

39:50.288 --> 39:53.058
The judges believe in me
and believe I can go far,

39:53.091 --> 39:55.060
so I really
have to step up my game

39:55.093 --> 39:57.128
and be nothing but perfect.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.397
I'm not taking this
second chance for granted.

39:59.431 --> 40:03.234
Gordon: S.J.,
you plate like an angel,

40:03.268 --> 40:05.537
but tonight you presented me

40:05.571 --> 40:07.739
with a halibut
that was so overcooked,

40:07.773 --> 40:09.641
I had very little
to hold on to.

40:09.675 --> 40:12.043
Here's the good news.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.879
Don't let this now
be a sticking point

40:13.912 --> 40:16.948
to where you want to go
with this industry.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.950
Continue studying, graduate,

40:18.984 --> 40:21.453
and when that's done, call me.

40:21.487 --> 40:22.988
Yes, Chef.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.323
This food dream is not over.

40:25.356 --> 40:28.159
I am gonna promise you
that my door is open

40:28.193 --> 40:29.728
once you finish your studies.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.230
- Nice.
- Thank you.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.665
I'm just so glad
that I was able

40:33.699 --> 40:35.333
to make it this far
into this competition,

40:35.366 --> 40:37.302
and that I've met
all these amazing contestants.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.571
And being mentored
by the best culinary pillars

40:39.605 --> 40:42.440
in this industry was just
mind-blowing, breathtaking,

40:42.474 --> 40:44.743
and I'm just so grateful
for this opportunity.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.747
Please, place your apron
on your bench

40:48.780 --> 40:50.248
- and have a safe trip home.
- Thank you.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.316
- Good night, S.J.
- Thank you.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.184
S.J.!

40:55.153 --> 40:56.855
I can't say that
I'm not disappointed right now,

40:56.888 --> 41:00.091
but, honestly, this journey
has been so amazing.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.829
- Bye.
- It just made me realize
that much more

41:03.862 --> 41:06.131
that food
isn't just a hobby to me.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.500
It's something I wanna pursue,
something I wanna make my life.

41:08.534 --> 41:11.937
- S.J.!
- Even though I may be leaving
the MasterChef kitchen,

41:11.970 --> 41:13.939
I'm never gonna stop chasing
after my food dream

41:13.972 --> 41:15.974
of having
that Korean food empire.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.376
And when I graduate,
I'm gonna hit up Gordon Ramsay,

41:18.409 --> 41:19.745
and go like, "I'm ready."

41:23.882 --> 41:26.217
Gordon:
And just like that,

41:26.251 --> 41:29.621
we are down to the top 10.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.189
With S.J. gone,

41:31.222 --> 41:33.458
that leaves Gordon
with four aprons,

41:33.491 --> 41:36.227
Aarón with three,
and Joe with three.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.964
Every time you cook
in this kitchen,

41:38.997 --> 41:40.899
bring your A game.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.367
The pressure is on
more and more.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.702
There's just no room
for mistakes.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.336
I gotta keep moving forward

41:45.370 --> 41:46.738
and staying strong
for Gordon.

41:46.772 --> 41:48.139
Get some sleep.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.709
Good night.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.978
Narrator: Next time,
on "MasterChef"...

41:53.011 --> 41:54.846
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

41:54.880 --> 41:56.414
Ashley:
They're landing for dinner!

41:56.447 --> 41:59.885
When the top 10
cook for American heroes...

41:59.918 --> 42:02.888
100 airmen.
This is massive!

42:02.921 --> 42:05.256
- expectations...
- Hanger steak.

42:05.290 --> 42:07.325
- That's a no-no.
- ...are sky-high.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.027
These are incinerated.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.329
Gordon:
How do we serve that
to the Air Force?

42:11.362 --> 42:14.065
Samantha: Oh, my God.
We're getting invaded.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.701
Joe: This pork chop
is completely raw.

42:15.734 --> 42:17.769
- No!
- And I'm about to call
for a mayday,

42:17.803 --> 42:19.504
because we all
might be going down.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.539
Go away! Go away.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.248
You've just taken a bite
out of MasterChef.

42:30.281 --> 42:32.718
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

42:33.952 --> 42:35.253
Are you ready?

42:36.955 --> 42:38.123
You are hot!

42:38.156 --> 42:40.358
MAN: * I'm in a sweet spot *

42:40.391 --> 42:42.360
* I'm feeling good *

42:42.393 --> 42:44.596
* The sun is shining *

42:44.630 --> 42:46.064
-Wake up.
-Challenge!

42:46.097 --> 42:47.799
* I'm gonna light it up *

42:47.833 --> 42:49.601
* Yeah, I'm gonna light it up *

42:49.635 --> 42:51.637
* Check it out
I'm gonna light it up *

42:51.670 --> 42:53.571
* Yeah, I'm gonna light it up *

42:53.605 --> 42:54.572
* Just check it out *

42:54.606 --> 42:56.441
* I'm gonna light it up *

42:56.474 --> 42:58.276
* Yeah, I'm gonna light it up *

42:58.309 --> 42:59.645
-(audience cheering)
-Let's go!

42:59.678 --> 43:02.480
* Let me show you
What it's all about *
