WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.177
Christy.

00:03.264 --> 00:05.483
Do me a favor and bus table six.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.311
[sighs]
I'’m kind of slammed.

00:07.398 --> 00:08.486
Why can'’t Hector do it?

00:08.573 --> 00:10.314
Immigration
retirement party.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.142
Half the kitchen staff is hiding
in the freezer.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.970
Got it.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.930
Hola.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.717
Boy, that'’s good scotch.

00:21.804 --> 00:24.589
What a waste. Ugh.

00:24.676 --> 00:27.462
What is wrong with these people?

00:32.336 --> 00:33.729
Oops.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.434
Okay.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.046
What'’s done is done.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.010
They'’re in
the freezer.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.584
Hey!

01:05.282 --> 01:09.504
Which one of you miserable sons
of bitches is horny?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.027
[gasps]

01:14.857 --> 01:16.206
Oh, Mom.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.730
I just had
the worst drunk dream.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.080
It'’s okay,
baby.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.604
Now, be a love,
and tie Mama off.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.433
[gasps]

01:30.438 --> 01:31.656
Mom!

01:31.743 --> 01:32.875
What?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.530
Nothing.

01:35.617 --> 01:36.705
Just checking.

01:40.578 --> 01:43.103
What?!

02:01.121 --> 02:02.818
It seemed so real,
like I had just

02:02.905 --> 02:03.993
thrown away my whole year.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.212
It'’s okay, honey.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.822
It'’s a slip dream.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.389
I'’ve been sober 33 years,
I still get '’em.

02:09.477 --> 02:10.782
Really?
Oh, yeah.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.523
A couple months ago,

02:12.610 --> 02:16.136
I dreamt I was snorting blow
off of Tom Jones'’ ass.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.573
Who'’s Tom Jones?

02:20.314 --> 02:22.620
Thanks for ruining
a beautiful dream.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.189
What?

02:26.276 --> 02:27.799
Nothing.
Just Checking.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.019
I said I was sorry.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.110
For me, slip dreams are a signal
something'’s bothering me

02:34.197 --> 02:35.372
and I'’m not dealing with it.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.766
Boy, I don'’t know.

02:37.853 --> 02:40.595
I can'’t think of anything
that'’s bothering me.

02:44.773 --> 02:47.471
She drove, so I'’m gonna stick
with that.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.039
Okay, you know what?

02:50.126 --> 02:52.302
Maybe you'’re ready
to start helping

02:52.389 --> 02:53.869
somebody else stay sober.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.480
Maybe it is time for me
to start giving back.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.829
Okay.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.875
Go talk to that new
girl over there.

03:03.922 --> 03:07.099
Ooh, really?

03:07.187 --> 03:10.364
Can'’t I start with somebody
off the children'’s menu?

03:10.451 --> 03:11.800
Okay, how about her?

03:13.062 --> 03:14.411
Oh, that'’s
a Gucci bag.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.065
I can really help somebody
with a Gucci bag.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.154
Go.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.375
Maybe I should
help someone.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.028
What'’s stopping you?

03:23.115 --> 03:24.726
To be honest?

03:24.813 --> 03:26.336
A complete lack
of compassion.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.428
Hi.
Hi.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.734
Christy.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.257
Jill.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.563
Nice bag.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.043
Thanks.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.219
Gucci.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.221
I wouldn'’t know.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.921
Is this your
first meeting?

03:46.008 --> 03:48.576
How can you tell?

03:48.663 --> 03:50.926
Well, no offense,

03:51.013 --> 03:54.103
but you kind of look like
you just got tasered.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.066
I feel terrible.

04:01.153 --> 04:04.505
Yeah, I get it.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.334
A little over a year
ago I was sitting

04:07.421 --> 04:10.293
exactly where you
are right now.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.860
Of course, I wasn'’t
dressed as nice.

04:14.297 --> 04:17.952
In fact, I think I was
wearing this same sweater.

04:20.084 --> 04:22.000
You'’ve been sober a whole year?

04:22.087 --> 04:25.221
Yep. It went by like...

04:25.308 --> 04:27.963
tha... t.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.924
So, what'’s
been going on?

04:33.011 --> 04:36.319
Not much. Um...

04:36.406 --> 04:41.150
I got a DUI, my husband left me
and I tried to commit suicide.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.110
Oh, my God. You'’re
gonna do great here.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.336
Can I be a mom for a moment?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.033
Sure.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.253
How long'’s it been
since you got laid?

04:58.733 --> 05:00.169
What?

05:00.256 --> 05:02.650
Who keeps track
of that sort of thing?

05:02.737 --> 05:04.652
The answer is: six months ago,
the fireman.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.872
If you knew, why'’d you ask?

05:07.959 --> 05:09.352
Because I wanted
to talk about me,

05:09.439 --> 05:10.745
and I thought
I'’d come off better

05:10.832 --> 05:12.660
if I pretended
to be interested in you.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.183
Wow. I see you trying.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.184
I really do.

05:15.271 --> 05:16.533
Thank you.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.013
So, what'’s going on?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.667
I cannot wait
to bang your father.

05:21.843 --> 05:24.628
I mean, I know I have to bide my
time until his ticker'’s better,

05:24.715 --> 05:26.891
but all I can think about
is driving to Chico

05:26.978 --> 05:29.285
and draining him
like a dirty pool.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.289
Come on.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.900
You are talking about
my father'’s junk.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.381
No, you'’re talking about
his junk.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.514
I cloaked it
in an adorable metaphor.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.866
Maybe Violet is mature enough
to be comfortable

05:44.953 --> 05:46.476
with her grandmother'’s
sexuality.

05:46.563 --> 05:47.521
She'’s not.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.785
Anything other
than bills?

05:50.872 --> 05:51.916
Um, yeah.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.222
Something from
the Taylors.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.571
Ooh. Baby pictures!

05:54.658 --> 05:55.746
Open it, let'’s see.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.183
I don'’t know
if I want to.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.620
CHRISTY:
Oh, okay.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.578
Well, you don'’t
have to, sweetie.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.275
Yeah, we can just talk about

06:03.363 --> 06:05.495
whether your grandmommy
should have violent intercourse

06:05.582 --> 06:07.628
with your grandpappy.

06:16.854 --> 06:17.725
She'’s cute.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.422
Very cute.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.728
Beautiful.

06:20.815 --> 06:21.772
Oh, no.

06:21.859 --> 06:22.947
What?

06:23.034 --> 06:24.340
They named her "Gwyneth."

06:25.646 --> 06:26.734
What'’s wrong with Gwyneth?

06:26.821 --> 06:28.518
Seriously? I have to tell you?

06:30.520 --> 06:33.958
No, no. I get it.

06:34.045 --> 06:37.658
Oh, look at that cute
little bunny hat.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.137
You think that'’s cute?

06:39.224 --> 06:41.183
I do not.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.799
Okay. Well...

06:48.886 --> 06:51.236
I guess that went
as good as it could'’ve gone.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.107
Yeah.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.460
You ever wonder what it'’d have
been like if she kept the baby?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.027
Please don'’t go down that road.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.203
I suppose.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.038
Why don'’t I make us
some lunch.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.042
Thanks,
but I got to run.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.044
I'’m going to meet
that new girl, Jill.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.175
Roscoe, lunch!

07:17.262 --> 07:18.176
ROSCOE:
I'’m not hungry!

07:18.263 --> 07:19.221
Grandma'’s making it.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.222
ROSCOE:
Okay!

07:24.095 --> 07:25.880
You know you'’re buying his love
with bacon.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.621
Still love.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.494
[knocking on door]

07:31.581 --> 07:33.583
Hang on!

07:33.670 --> 07:34.976
[knocking continues]

07:35.063 --> 07:36.934
One more time
and nobody'’s home.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.679
[Eastern European accent]:
Who are you?

07:42.766 --> 07:43.941
Who are you?

07:44.028 --> 07:45.987
Landlord.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.119
Is Crusty here?

07:49.251 --> 07:50.861
Crusty?

07:50.948 --> 07:52.515
Crusty Plunkett.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.735
Oh, that Crusty.

07:54.822 --> 07:55.997
Um, no.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.389
Can I ask what this is about?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.608
Who are you?

07:58.695 --> 08:02.525
Really? We'’re starting over?

08:02.612 --> 08:04.309
Okay, I'’m her mother.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.224
You'’re living here?Absolutely not.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.052
Good, '’cause you'’re living here,
rent would be higher.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.316
No, no. We wouldn'’t want it
to be higher.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.450
So, what'’s up?

08:14.537 --> 08:17.105
Your daughter--
three months behind on rent.

08:17.192 --> 08:21.239
Really? Well, that doesn'’t sound
like my little Crusty.

08:21.326 --> 08:25.374
48 hours, she don'’t pay--
I send sheriff for eviction.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.638
How come I'’m not smelling bacon?

08:33.991 --> 08:34.948
Excuse me.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.342
Are you hungry, baby?

08:38.429 --> 08:39.736
Uh-huh.

08:39.823 --> 08:40.998
You hear that?
He'’s starving.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.392
You want him
to be homeless, too?

08:44.654 --> 08:45.873
48 hours.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.528
Oh, come on.
Look at that face.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.748
Nice face.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.141
48 hours.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.447
Damn.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.449
You need
to get cuter.

09:00.191 --> 09:03.107
[knocking on door]

09:03.194 --> 09:05.501
Did you want me
to make you a sandwich?

09:05.588 --> 09:08.809
Oh, thanks,
but Jill and I are having lunch.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.638
Oh, right.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.944
Boy, she'’s lucky to have
a role model like you.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.033
Ahh.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.775
Yeah, I'’m just doing
what I can do.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.212
Leading by example.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.910
That'’s terrific.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.694
Say, maybe you can
give mesome advice.

09:24.781 --> 09:25.782
Mm.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.088
I can give it.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.569
It'’s up to you to take it.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.136
That'’s good.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.443
I might use that with Jill.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.923
So, here'’s
the thing.

09:36.010 --> 09:39.143
I have this friend
who has an idiot daughter.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.841
I mean,
a real screw-up.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.060
Ugh. That'’s too bad.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.975
Makes you appreciate me, huh?

09:45.062 --> 09:48.370
You bet.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.807
So, here'’s
the thing.

09:50.894 --> 09:55.638
My friend'’s daughter doesn'’t
pay the rent for three months.

09:55.725 --> 09:59.076
And now she and her whole family
are gonna be evicted.

09:59.163 --> 10:02.036
Ooh, yikes.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.690
Wait a minute.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.649
You don'’t have any friends.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.260
Yes, but I have
an idiot daughter.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.655
Was that the landlord
at the door?

10:12.742 --> 10:13.874
Yes, Crusty.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.442
How much time did he give us?

10:17.529 --> 10:19.662
48 hours.
Oh, boy.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.272
How could you let this happen?

10:21.359 --> 10:23.361
"Let it happen"?!

10:23.448 --> 10:27.583
Between Violet'’s pregnancy, the
adoption and Dad'’s heart attack,

10:27.670 --> 10:29.367
I lost a lot of days at work.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.326
Yeah, but what about the money
I'’ve been kicking in?

10:32.588 --> 10:33.676
Yes.

10:33.763 --> 10:34.721
Okay.

10:36.418 --> 10:40.030
Before I tell you about that,

10:40.117 --> 10:43.730
you have to understand
that we were so far in the hole,

10:43.817 --> 10:46.994
the only way out was
by getting creative.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.866
So I started thinking
outside the box.

10:49.953 --> 10:50.998
Uh-huh.

10:51.085 --> 10:53.870
Like the box was here.

10:53.957 --> 10:57.961
And I was way over here.
Thinking.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.009
What did you do?

11:03.271 --> 11:05.273
Um, well...

11:07.101 --> 11:10.017
I guess I can'’t put off
saying it anymore...

11:18.503 --> 11:20.549
Say it!

11:22.682 --> 11:25.467
Okay.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.469
Remember how I used to bet

11:27.556 --> 11:30.907
on football and
basketball and such?

11:30.994 --> 11:32.866
Yeah, you sucked at it.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.390
[quietly]:
Still do.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.523
You gambled away the rent money?

11:38.610 --> 11:39.655
No, no, no!

11:39.742 --> 11:41.526
You'’re not listening to me.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.399
We never had rent money.

11:44.486 --> 11:47.532
I gambled away
what little we had

11:47.619 --> 11:49.665
on the hopes
of getting the rent money.

11:49.752 --> 11:50.797
See?

11:50.884 --> 11:52.233
Outside the box.

11:54.061 --> 11:57.151
You swore you weren'’t
gonna gamble again.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.720
I thought I'’d be
better at it sober.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.289
Let'’s keep in mind
the most important thing

12:05.376 --> 12:07.291
throughout all
of this is...

12:07.378 --> 12:08.989
that I never
took a drink.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.730
We'’d be better
off if you did!

12:10.817 --> 12:12.601
If you were drunk, you
could bang the landlord

12:12.688 --> 12:15.082
and we wouldn'’t
be homeless.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.736
That'’s a terrible
thing to say.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.524
Think he might
go for it?

12:24.308 --> 12:26.223
Just...

12:34.405 --> 12:35.885
You know what I like
about this cheesecake?

12:35.972 --> 12:37.452
It'’s creamy,
but still very light.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.932
I think they use some
kind of a low-fat...

12:39.019 --> 12:40.324
Shut up.
...yogurt.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.549
You understand gambling
is just your addiction

12:47.636 --> 12:49.159
crawling out
another hole?

12:49.246 --> 12:50.857
Yeah.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.336
I get that now.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.209
[chuckling]

12:55.296 --> 12:56.732
It'’s kind of like
when I went crazy

12:56.819 --> 12:58.255
with the Oreos and the...

12:58.342 --> 13:00.344
Shut up.
...Ho Hos.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.872
How much do you owe
the landlord?

13:05.959 --> 13:06.873
Not much.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.222
Give me a number.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.659
I don'’t wanna.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.052
Say it!

13:12.139 --> 13:13.880
Four grand.
[hisses]

13:13.967 --> 13:15.185
Oh, I hate it when she goes...

13:15.272 --> 13:17.100
[hisses]

13:17.187 --> 13:18.536
All right.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.060
Here'’s what
we'’re gonna do.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.062
How much money do
you have right now?

13:22.149 --> 13:25.717
I can scrounge up $300... $400.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.545
Bonnie?

13:27.632 --> 13:29.112
Yes?

13:32.594 --> 13:33.856
What do you got?

13:33.943 --> 13:36.076
[hisses]Mom.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.513
Oh, I suppose I can
kick in that much.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.820
Okay. I can do the same.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.430
If you can give the landlord

13:42.517 --> 13:44.171
anything like a month'’s rent,

13:44.258 --> 13:45.868
I'’m sure it'’ll
buy you some time.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.348
I'’ll pay you back.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.698
Damn straight
you'’ll pay me back.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.837
So, anyway, you were so smart

13:57.924 --> 13:59.621
to suggest that I work
with that new girl.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.014
It has been incredibly...

14:01.101 --> 14:02.015
Shut up.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.973
...satisfying.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.457
Please, Gabriel,
I really need to
work more shifts.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.285
If I had them,
I'’d give them to you.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.113
How about one of
Andrea'’s shifts?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.115
I'’m not one to gossip,

14:15.202 --> 14:17.465
but the lady doesn'’t wash
her hands after she tinkles.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.989
Andrea, hey, lookin'’ good!

14:21.686 --> 14:23.775
Do you really want
hepatitis on the menu?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.256
I said no.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.651
Is this because
I stopped sleeping with you?

14:29.738 --> 14:31.392
No!

14:31.479 --> 14:33.089
It'’s because I started
sleeping with Andrea.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.049
Damn it.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.138
Yes, I want ten dimes on
Mississippi Tech, straight up.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.444
Yes, I know they'’re
18-point underdogs.

14:40.531 --> 14:41.837
I got a tip.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.839
Yeah... just put the bet down.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.798
Hi.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.322
Hello.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.801
You got a tip?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.542
Maybe.
Is it a good one?

14:51.629 --> 14:54.371
Do onions caramelize at
310 degrees Fahrenheit?

14:55.329 --> 14:56.808
I have no idea.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.376
But, uh, back to the tip,
is it like a sure thing?

14:59.463 --> 15:01.683
Does lemon zest
pair with ricotta?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.467
I get it, you'’re a chef.

15:03.554 --> 15:04.512
Just tell me!

15:04.599 --> 15:05.643
Can'’t lose.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.036
Pays five to one.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.255
Really?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.868
Five times 1,200 is...

15:12.955 --> 15:14.826
Zero, zero, carry the one...

15:14.914 --> 15:17.046
Okay, it'’s six grand.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.963
You want me to put
a bet down for you?

15:23.444 --> 15:26.360
No, I can'’t.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.275
I just can'’t.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.453
Yeah, we both
know she'’s gonna.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.587
You cannot tell my mother
about this.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.861
Hi, I'’m Jill
and I'’m an alcoholic.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.819
GROUP: Hi, Jill.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.821
Hi, Jill.

15:55.302 --> 15:58.131
I have six days now.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.137
I'’m a little scared up here,

16:04.224 --> 16:05.529
I'’ve really never
talked in front

16:05.616 --> 16:08.054
of a group of people before.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.533
Unless you count
the team of doctors

16:09.620 --> 16:10.926
who were trying to determine

16:11.013 --> 16:12.493
if I was still
a danger to myself.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.103
[laughter]

16:14.190 --> 16:17.715
Anyway, my sponsor told me

16:17.802 --> 16:20.370
that I should share, so...

16:20.457 --> 16:21.806
here I am.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.721
And I'’m doing
everything she says

16:23.808 --> 16:26.463
because I really want to have it
all together like she does.

16:26.550 --> 16:27.812
You'’re an inspiration
to me, Christy.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.472
The way she turned
her life around

16:35.559 --> 16:37.431
gives me hope that
maybe I can do the same.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.085
[very quietly]:
Oh, come on, make the kick,

16:39.172 --> 16:41.304
make the kick.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.090
Christy says that
it'’s all about honesty,

16:44.177 --> 16:46.048
taking responsibility
for my mistakes

16:46.135 --> 16:47.528
and doing things differently.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.965
The snap is good,
kick is up.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.054
Anyway...
I guess that'’s it, so...

16:52.141 --> 16:53.186
Thank you.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.796
I won!

16:54.883 --> 16:57.929
Oh, thank you, God, I won!

17:00.106 --> 17:01.411
Hey.
LEADER:
Who else would like to share?

17:05.372 --> 17:07.329
Are you crying?

17:07.416 --> 17:08.940
I'’m just so happy.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.290
For you.

17:12.901 --> 17:13.989
You'’re the best.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.208
[crying]:
Thank you.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.776
[silently mouthing]

17:23.781 --> 17:25.392
Ooh.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.655
I don'’t usually sleep
with fat, bald guys,

17:27.742 --> 17:31.006
but tonight'’s your night,
Mr. Franklin.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.225
Don'’t turn around.What?

17:32.312 --> 17:33.617
Just give me the money
and walk away.

17:33.704 --> 17:35.619
Oh, no. No, no.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.621
Look, I'’m not screwing around.
There'’s a gun in your back.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.188
Yeah, I can feel it,
I'’m actually

17:39.275 --> 17:41.016
peeing myself a little.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.235
But you don'’t understand,

17:42.322 --> 17:44.193
I need this money
to pay my rent.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.195
How about we split it?Shut up.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.241
Yeah, gee, I been
getting that a lot lately.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.634
Okay, uh, see if this works.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.201
Follow me to my landlord'’s,

17:52.288 --> 17:53.811
uh, let me give him this money,

17:53.898 --> 17:56.423
and then you rob him.
Everybody wins.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.645
[quietly]:
No.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.781
MAN:
I'’m so frigging happy
I can'’t even stand it.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.043
Hey.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.001
Great news.
Landlord came by,

18:10.089 --> 18:12.830
he said one month'’s rent
would be fine.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.356
He said that, huh?Yup. I told him
to come back in the morning.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.098
[exhales]
Great.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.057
That'’s when
I'’ll sleep with him.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.103
What are you talking about?

18:25.278 --> 18:26.496
I got mugged.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.282
The money'’s gone.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.370
Are you kidding me?

18:30.457 --> 18:32.328
I wish I was.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.374
There was a gun at my back.

18:34.461 --> 18:38.160
Oh, baby, oh, my God, come here.

18:38.247 --> 18:41.294
Oh, Mom,
I was so scared.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.078
Oh. It'’s gonna be all right.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.080
Everything'’s gonna be fine.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.566
Wait a minute.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.089
There was no mugger.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.873
Yeah, there was.
Keep hugging.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.484
No, no, no, no.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.399
You gambled again, didn'’t you?

18:59.486 --> 19:01.401
Well...

19:01.488 --> 19:03.881
Oh, I knew it!
What is wrong with you?

19:03.968 --> 19:05.318
But I won!

19:05.405 --> 19:06.493
Oh, really?
Where'’s the money?

19:06.580 --> 19:08.495
I told you, I got mugged.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.106
Christy, it is time to admit
you'’ve got another problem.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.064
Gambling'’s not a problem
when you win.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.810
And I did get mugged.Sure you did. Let me guess,

19:19.897 --> 19:21.508
he was a big,
scary-looking black guy?

19:21.595 --> 19:22.509
He was.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.337
Shame on you, Christy.

19:24.424 --> 19:27.340
It'’s not my fault
he perpetuates the stereotype.

19:27.427 --> 19:30.299
Oh, my God, save it, we don'’t
have time for your racism.

19:30.386 --> 19:33.563
Now, do we have any cash for our
heartless Armenian landlord?

19:34.999 --> 19:36.479
Well, I guess that'’s it.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.742
Sheriff shows up in the morning,
we get evicted.

19:38.829 --> 19:41.963
Oh, I don'’t want the kids
to have to go through that.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.312
What'’s the alternative?

19:43.399 --> 19:45.227
Give me a second,
let me think.

19:53.409 --> 19:56.195
I need another box.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.637
Pack your stuff, Roscoe. We'’re
going on a surprise vacation.

20:03.724 --> 20:07.031
What?BONNIE: Pack up, Violet,
we'’re skipping out on the rent.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.120
What are you standing there for?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.645
We got to get out of here
before the landlord shows up.

20:11.732 --> 20:14.169
[sighs]
Roscoe grew up here.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.432
This is a memory that'’s
gonna be gone forever.

20:17.825 --> 20:18.956
Hang on.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.483
What are you doing?

20:23.570 --> 20:25.441
It'’s not like we'’re gonna get
the security deposit back.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.625
That works.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.416
VIOLET:
This place sucks, Mom.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.331
Oh, come on.
Look on the bright side--

20:45.418 --> 20:47.246
we finally have HBO.
