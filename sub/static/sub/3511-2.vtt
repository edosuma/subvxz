WEBVTT

00:09.497 --> 00:10.826
Castle, what do you
think of this one?

00:11.139 --> 00:12.704
Mm. Sexy.

00:13.070 --> 00:15.549
Sexy? What do you mean by sexy?

00:15.630 --> 00:16.296
I mean...

00:17.257 --> 00:18.817
Well, I-I mean sexy.

00:18.818 --> 00:20.220
Yeah, sexy.
What's wrong with sexy?

00:20.221 --> 00:22.758
Oh, God, Castle.
This is my first day back at work.

00:22.769 --> 00:24.412
I'm supposed to look normal.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.398
No one is going to be able
to tell that we're together

00:26.399 --> 00:27.509
by how you are dressed.

00:27.510 --> 00:30.389
Oh, no? I only work with
a roomful of detectives.

00:30.390 --> 00:31.400
It's their job.

00:34.616 --> 00:35.394
What about this one?

00:37.102 --> 00:37.797
No.

00:43.924 --> 00:46.067
You just want me to take my
shirt off again, don't you?

00:46.184 --> 00:47.367
- What?
- Stop it.

00:47.610 --> 00:50.935
I told you, the NYPD
has a strict policy

00:50.936 --> 00:53.100
about coworkers... dating.

00:53.247 --> 00:54.482
Yes, but since I'm
not getting paid,

00:54.483 --> 00:55.977
- technically, we're not coworkers.
- Oh, really?

00:55.978 --> 00:58.124
And you think that Captain Gates
is gonna see it that way?

00:58.125 --> 01:00.391
If anyone finds out, and
she gets wind of it--

01:00.392 --> 01:02.006
No one is going to find out.

01:02.007 --> 01:03.532
I haven't even told
my mother or Alexis.

01:03.533 --> 01:05.400
Yeah, that's because
they're in Europe

01:05.438 --> 01:06.835
celebrating her graduation.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.728
Yes, true. But I haven't
told them long distance.

01:08.804 --> 01:10.639
Look, no one is
going to find out.

01:11.409 --> 01:12.762
But just to be safe,

01:12.763 --> 01:14.307
you might want to change
out of those pants.

01:15.003 --> 01:16.180
Oh, there's a murder uptown.

01:16.692 --> 01:18.052
And looks like the
pants stay on.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.566
Castle, remember, act normal.

01:20.764 --> 01:22.967
And when we're in public,
you're single and I'm single.

01:22.968 --> 01:24.097
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:24.173 --> 01:24.804
Thanks.

01:27.958 --> 01:29.145
So that's a no to
carpooling then?

01:31.453 --> 01:32.082
I'll take a cab.

01:39.115 --> 01:40.624
Good morning, Detective Beckett.

01:41.446 --> 01:43.044
Castle, where is my coffee?

01:43.066 --> 01:43.996
You already had one.

01:44.445 --> 01:46.943
You've been bringing me coffee
for the past four years.

01:46.944 --> 01:49.096
I told you to act normal.
This is gonna look suspicious.

01:49.097 --> 01:50.677
Don't worry. Relax.

01:51.061 --> 01:52.809
You're overthinking
this, really.

01:55.028 --> 01:55.791
What, no coffee?

01:57.818 --> 01:58.772
I forgot hers.

01:59.073 --> 01:59.800
You forgot?

02:00.245 --> 02:02.018
On her first day back
from suspension?

02:02.159 --> 02:03.625
It's all right.
I've already forgiven him.

02:03.953 --> 02:04.846
So who's our vic?

02:05.130 --> 02:05.926
Local celeb.

02:06.079 --> 02:08.574
Groundskeeper found her
tucked behind this fountain

02:08.574 --> 02:09.489
early this morning.

02:09.633 --> 02:13.113
She's actually the weather
girl for WHNY--Mandy Michaels.

02:13.114 --> 02:14.473
- Mandy Michaels?
- Yeah.

02:14.474 --> 02:15.455
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:15.854 --> 02:17.763
Oh, man.
I watched her every night.

02:17.907 --> 02:19.311
She had the best...

02:21.622 --> 02:22.462
forecasts.

02:23.061 --> 02:25.342
What? L-listen, as a single man,

02:25.489 --> 02:27.181
I appreciated her assets.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.671
You can't tell me people
watched her for the weather.

02:30.356 --> 02:31.085
Welcome back.

02:31.532 --> 02:32.141
Thank you.

02:32.313 --> 02:34.004
You--what, are you doing
something different?

02:34.075 --> 02:35.340
No. Why?

02:35.721 --> 02:38.018
I don't know.
Something's changed.

02:39.678 --> 02:40.548
So how'd she die?

02:40.957 --> 02:42.423
Single GSW.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.409
Shot was called in by neighbors
last night at 10:28 PM.

02:45.487 --> 02:46.650
Which fits lividity.

02:46.765 --> 02:48.540
There's also signs
of a struggle.

02:48.754 --> 02:50.598
Vic has bruises on her upper arm

02:50.599 --> 02:51.897
and her blouse was ripped.

02:52.152 --> 02:53.804
There's no sign of a
wallet, purse, or phone.

02:54.281 --> 02:55.576
Sounds like a
mugging gone wrong.

02:55.577 --> 02:57.636
I got tech pinging her
phone as we speak.

02:58.938 --> 03:00.612
Speaking of which, I'm
gonna go check on that.

03:02.491 --> 03:04.145
You guys still haven't
buried the hatchet?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.090
It is what it is.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.130
So according to Mandy's
producer at WHNY,

03:08.131 --> 03:09.173
she was last seen

03:09.174 --> 03:11.361
by her camera crew
doing a weather spot

03:11.362 --> 03:12.991
at City Of Trust
Children's Hospital

03:12.992 --> 03:14.332
last night at 9:30 PM.

03:14.713 --> 03:15.953
That's 20 blocks from here.

03:15.954 --> 03:17.665
Yeah, and Mandy's apartment's
the other direction.

03:17.826 --> 03:20.142
So what was she doing here
in the park an hour later?

03:20.561 --> 03:21.086
Yo.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.230
Mandy's phone is active.

03:23.284 --> 03:24.639
Tech tracked her GPS signal

03:24.640 --> 03:25.985
to a building on the
Lower East Side.

03:26.050 --> 03:27.097
Sounds like our mugger.

03:27.161 --> 03:28.095
All right, you guys
check in to it.

03:28.096 --> 03:29.741
Castle and I will
talk to next of kin.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.683
Yeah, I'd pr-- you
know, I'd be much--

03:30.684 --> 03:32.782
Just--just go. Okay?

03:39.288 --> 03:40.956
The signal's coming from one
of the rooms on this floor.

03:41.958 --> 03:43.125
The question is, which one?

03:44.789 --> 03:45.511
What the hell are you doing?

03:45.692 --> 03:47.635
Being a good cop, narrowing
down my options.

03:47.636 --> 03:48.384
What are you doing?

03:53.050 --> 03:54.071
Right here.

03:58.082 --> 03:58.812
NYPD!

04:04.688 --> 04:06.124
Hands, now! Don't move!

04:06.247 --> 04:07.054
I didn't do anything.

04:07.846 --> 04:08.606
I didn't do anything.

04:08.607 --> 04:09.392
I swear.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.071
That's her phone.

04:14.818 --> 04:15.515
No.

04:16.428 --> 04:17.225
It's my phone.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.024
I suppose that's
your purse, too?

04:22.000 --> 04:28.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:31.090 --> 04:32.039
Jonathan Goodheart.

04:34.090 --> 04:37.526
You have been a very,
very bad boy, Jonathan.

04:37.901 --> 04:38.798
It's Johnny.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.706
It says here, Jonathan, that you

04:40.707 --> 04:42.499
have priors for stalking,

04:43.374 --> 04:44.351
indecent exposure.

04:44.746 --> 04:46.791
That stalking was a
misunderanding, and...

04:49.799 --> 04:51.790
That other thing happened
on a really hot day.

04:53.132 --> 04:54.260
Well, you just have
an explanation

04:54.261 --> 04:55.405
for everything, don't
you, Jonathan?

04:56.641 --> 04:57.746
So why don't you explain to me

04:57.917 --> 05:00.203
what you were doing with
Mandy Michaels' purse.

05:00.204 --> 05:00.947
I found it.

05:01.748 --> 05:02.540
You found it?

05:02.581 --> 05:04.268
In a dumpster on
Lexington and 9th.

05:06.837 --> 05:07.554
It was soft.

05:08.655 --> 05:09.947
I like things that are soft.

05:11.716 --> 05:13.141
Yeah, take care, Ms. Michaels.

05:21.213 --> 05:21.829
Hey.

05:22.580 --> 05:23.220
You okay?

05:23.609 --> 05:25.728
Well, I-I just got off the
phone with Mandy's parents.

05:25.729 --> 05:28.135
They said that she spent
most of her time at work.

05:28.387 --> 05:29.310
There was no boyfriend,

05:29.311 --> 05:31.042
and they have no idea why
she was in the park.

05:31.557 --> 05:32.883
Hey, guys. Check this out.

05:33.104 --> 05:34.122
I was going through
Mandy's purse,

05:34.123 --> 05:35.408
and I found this folded
up in her wallet.

05:36.688 --> 05:38.885
"If any of this gets
out, I'll kill you"?

05:39.245 --> 05:40.855
I'm gonna go ahead and say
she was being threatened.

05:41.055 --> 05:42.659
That doesn't mean this
is why she was killed.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.850
All the evidence points to the
fact that she was mugged.

05:45.276 --> 05:46.132
It wasn't a mugging.

05:46.533 --> 05:47.350
How can you tell?

05:47.776 --> 05:49.741
Blood spatter on her
blouse indicates

05:49.742 --> 05:51.665
the shirt was ripped
after the gunshot.

05:51.897 --> 05:53.065
What about the bruising?

05:53.076 --> 05:54.022
Postmortem.

05:54.198 --> 05:55.440
To make it look like a mugging.

05:55.634 --> 05:57.070
Someone's trying to
cover their tracks.

05:57.452 --> 05:58.272
Speaking of which,

05:58.525 --> 06:00.994
I figured out what's different.

06:01.485 --> 06:02.495
You're having sex.

06:04.295 --> 06:04.991
Excuse me?

06:05.118 --> 06:06.425
Oh, don't try to deny it.

06:06.482 --> 06:08.612
There's a glow.
I know that glow.

06:10.460 --> 06:11.830
So who's the guy?

06:13.732 --> 06:15.041
Yeah, Beckett, who's the guy?

06:16.008 --> 06:17.626
Nobody that you
would know, okay?

06:17.627 --> 06:18.957
Are you sure?
I know a lot of guys.

06:19.075 --> 06:21.254
I'm sure. Anything else?

06:21.372 --> 06:22.451
As a matter of fact,

06:22.745 --> 06:24.695
I found makeup on Mandy's blouse

06:24.789 --> 06:27.018
that's much lighter than
the shade that she wears.

06:27.273 --> 06:29.203
The position indicates
close contact,

06:29.521 --> 06:30.917
like she fought with someone.

06:31.518 --> 06:32.883
Rounding up all the
women in the city

06:32.884 --> 06:35.100
who wear lighter makeup
is a pretty wide net.

06:35.332 --> 06:36.612
It isn't just any makeup.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.821
It's formulated for
high-definition cameras.

06:38.908 --> 06:40.803
Like the ones they
use at TV stations.

06:43.145 --> 06:44.710
In the meantime, authorities
are still on the hunt

06:44.711 --> 06:47.077
for suspects in the
Mandy Michaels slaying.

06:47.270 --> 06:48.783
Though few details
have been released,

06:48.784 --> 06:51.504
we can confirm that she was
shot to death late last night

06:51.819 --> 06:52.595
in Paley Park.

06:54.275 --> 06:56.915
Speaking on behalf of the
entire broadcast community,

06:57.997 --> 07:00.163
the 5-day forecast just
won't be the same.

07:00.634 --> 07:01.261
Chuck?

07:01.523 --> 07:02.309
Thank you, Miles.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.716
We'll bring you more on
this difficult story

07:04.717 --> 07:05.861
as events unfold.

07:06.562 --> 07:07.385
But coming up next,

07:07.761 --> 07:09.876
your morning coffee
could be killing you.

07:10.151 --> 07:11.444
We'll have that story
when we come back.

07:11.592 --> 07:12.692
And we're out to commercial.

07:13.093 --> 07:14.958
Everyone here is devastated.

07:15.421 --> 07:16.303
We're like a family.

07:17.056 --> 07:19.478
What kind of family,
happy or dysfunctional?

07:20.068 --> 07:20.875
What do you mean?

07:20.899 --> 07:22.954
Meaning, as the station manager,

07:22.955 --> 07:24.222
you would know your personnel.

07:24.683 --> 07:26.217
Did she have any
conflicts with anyone?

07:26.218 --> 07:27.564
Sure, but I-I can't imagine

07:27.565 --> 07:29.012
that has anything to
do with what happened.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.081
Well, who was it?

07:30.397 --> 07:31.927
The other weather
girl, Rebecca Fog.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.736
Is Fog her real name?

07:34.561 --> 07:35.495
And what was the conflict?

07:35.897 --> 07:37.547
Rebecca was the new
meteorologist.

07:37.611 --> 07:39.930
She was ambitious and
nipping at Mandy's heels.

07:40.353 --> 07:41.690
Had anything happened recently?

07:41.998 --> 07:43.678
As a matter of fact, they did

07:43.679 --> 07:45.191
just get into a
bit of a scuffle.

07:45.561 --> 07:46.855
Really, when was this?

07:47.078 --> 07:49.340
Last night. I'll show you.

07:52.996 --> 07:54.239
Sorry, Chip. We need the bay.

07:54.434 --> 07:55.422
Yeah, sure, Harvey.

07:55.726 --> 07:56.348
What's up?

07:56.584 --> 07:59.229
Bob, I need the unaired footage
from Mandy's segment last night

07:59.230 --> 08:00.153
at City Of Trust.

08:00.338 --> 08:02.334
The police need to see
some tape on Mandy.

08:02.573 --> 08:03.810
Yeah, that was a terrible thing.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.922
Whoa.
Talk about New York's finest.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.283
She really a cop?

08:08.687 --> 08:09.864
Yes, she's really a cop.

08:10.818 --> 08:13.660
Chip Chambers. I do sports.
And you can arrest me anytime.

08:13.764 --> 08:15.666
Yeah, well, maybe I will.

08:16.924 --> 08:17.575
That's it.

08:18.577 --> 08:19.942
Well, that's your
weather, folks,

08:19.943 --> 08:21.642
straight from my lips
to your living room.

08:21.927 --> 08:24.683
This is Mandy Michaels reporting
live from the toy drive

08:24.684 --> 08:26.745
at the City Of Trust
Children's Hospital.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.214
And we're clear.

08:29.569 --> 08:30.096
Rebecca?

08:30.436 --> 08:31.596
What the hell are
you doing here?

08:31.597 --> 08:33.126
You know exactly
what I'm doing here,

08:33.202 --> 08:34.313
- you conniving bitch!
- Hey, knock it off.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.739
You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

08:37.044 --> 08:37.809
What happened?

08:38.072 --> 08:39.437
The cameraman turned
off his camera

08:39.438 --> 08:40.520
and broke up the fight.

08:40.568 --> 08:41.727
Did he see Rebecca leave?

08:41.832 --> 08:44.821
No. Once they settled down,
he left them there talking.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.508
Well, it must have
been a hell of a talk.

08:46.725 --> 08:48.074
An hour later, Mandy was dead.

08:50.976 --> 08:55.907

08:59.472 --> 09:03.021
Look, Mandy Michaels was a lazy,
entitled, big-boobed bimbo.

09:03.169 --> 09:05.393
I've been picking up her slack
since the minute I got here.

09:06.062 --> 09:08.126
"Harvey, "I can't go in the
helicopter for 'traffic live!'

09:08.127 --> 09:09.161
"because of my asthma.

09:09.162 --> 09:10.114
Make Rebecca do it."

09:10.906 --> 09:12.090
I mean, did I hate her? Yes.

09:12.194 --> 09:13.220
But I would never kill her.

09:13.488 --> 09:15.521
Except now that she's
dead, you get to trade in

09:15.522 --> 09:17.485
4:00 AM shift for the coveted

09:17.502 --> 09:19.762
and lucrative evening
news spot, right?

09:19.767 --> 09:20.630
Oh, please.

09:21.305 --> 09:22.559
I didn't need to
kill her for that.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.600
I just needed to wait.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.123
She was already past
her sell-by date.

09:25.407 --> 09:26.577
Well, according to Harvey,

09:26.578 --> 09:28.328
she still had a very
loyal audience.

09:28.392 --> 09:29.721
Sure. Yeah, people who cared

09:29.722 --> 09:31.883
about how many buttons
on her blouse were open.

09:31.991 --> 09:33.425
But at her age in high def,

09:33.426 --> 09:35.468
she was running out
of buttons fast.

09:35.734 --> 09:37.512
Then what was the
fight about, Ms. Fog?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.648
Look, I'm a certified meteorologist.
Okay?

09:40.683 --> 09:41.550
I have a brain.

09:41.551 --> 09:44.326
Mandy was just set
dressing with cleavage.

09:44.475 --> 09:46.490
My forecasts were way
more accurate than hers,

09:46.491 --> 09:47.896
and people were
starting to notice.

09:47.977 --> 09:51.480
So last week, to get back at
me, she breaks into my office,

09:51.688 --> 09:53.034
she steals a bunch
of my equipment.

09:53.528 --> 09:55.036
I mean, that's why I
went to confront her.

09:55.621 --> 09:57.737
But that's it. That's all.

09:58.608 --> 10:00.618
Where were you at
10:28 last night?

10:00.883 --> 10:01.828
Home sleeping.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.932
I mean, I have the 4:00 AM
shift, remember?

10:04.440 --> 10:06.973
And besides, she left the
children's hospital before I did.

10:07.014 --> 10:08.250
You want to find out
who killed Mandy,

10:08.251 --> 10:10.515
ask the person in the silver
G-Wagon who picked her up.

10:10.571 --> 10:11.234
What person?

10:11.318 --> 10:12.221
I don't know. Beats me.

10:12.308 --> 10:13.329
The car had tinted windows,

10:13.330 --> 10:14.973
but it sure seemed
like she knew them.

10:16.076 --> 10:18.378
So Rebecca was telling the
truth about where she was.

10:18.643 --> 10:20.274
She paid for the cab
with a credit card,

10:20.410 --> 10:21.932
and the cabbie dropped
her off at her apartment

10:21.933 --> 10:23.465
before Mandy was killed.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.401
Okay.
Yeah, so check traffic cams

10:25.402 --> 10:27.912
and surveillance in the area
for the silver G-Wagon.

10:29.246 --> 10:30.794
Yeah, I mean, if we're
lucky, we'll...

10:35.266 --> 10:36.734
We might actually get a plate.

10:40.998 --> 10:41.831
So, uh,

10:41.832 --> 10:43.624
were you able to track
down the phone records

10:43.825 --> 10:45.381
to see if she made any
calls that night?

10:46.278 --> 10:47.868
Mm-hmm. Okay.

10:53.065 --> 10:55.150
Richard. Richard Castle.

10:55.263 --> 10:58.006
Kristina.
Oh, I have not seen you...

10:58.007 --> 10:58.990
since...

10:58.995 --> 11:00.554
Since I interviewed
you on the red carpet

11:00.555 --> 11:02.002
and you promised to do my show.

11:03.011 --> 11:03.955
Oh, that's right. I did.

11:04.059 --> 11:05.513
Fred Willard canceled
on me tonight.

11:05.774 --> 11:07.485
I don't have a guest.
I feel like it's fate.

11:07.486 --> 11:09.160
Okay. I gotta go, Espo. Bye.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.879
- Tonight? Wow.
- 9:00 o'clock.

11:11.298 --> 11:12.540
I'm not taking no for an answer.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.090
Well, then I won't say no.

11:14.331 --> 11:16.276
Good. I'll see you soon, Ricky.

11:16.277 --> 11:16.982
All right.

11:19.735 --> 11:21.949
Oh, that's just their
entertainment reporter.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.742
She's...
My agent has been haranguing me

11:24.743 --> 11:26.075
to promote "Frozen Heat," so...

11:27.811 --> 11:28.706
Isn't she the reporter

11:28.730 --> 11:31.276
that shows up to cover
stories in her bikini?

11:31.313 --> 11:33.864
Yeah, y--I don't--is--
I didn't notice that.

11:34.033 --> 11:35.326
You want to try it again,

11:35.414 --> 11:36.645
make it sound a little
more convincing?

11:36.646 --> 11:37.484
No, I'm good.

11:37.505 --> 11:40.994
Okay. So the boys are running
down our mystery car.

11:40.995 --> 11:43.820
In the meantime, they found
something on Mandy's phone records.

11:43.821 --> 11:46.080
She was getting calls from
an anonymous burner cell.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.555
In fact, the last call she
got before her murder

11:48.556 --> 11:50.543
- was from that number.
- But there's no way to trace it.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.179
Yeah, there might be.
There's a pattern on the calls,

11:52.180 --> 11:55.128
and most of them came in on
weekdays between 2:00 and 4:00.

11:55.384 --> 11:56.477
That's right before
her broadcast.

11:56.478 --> 11:57.555
Which means she was here.

11:57.829 --> 12:00.456
Yeah, Mandy was here
between 2:00 and 4:00.

12:00.457 --> 12:02.511
She needed all the time in
that chair she could get.

12:02.512 --> 12:03.844
When a woman hits mid-30s,

12:04.072 --> 12:06.076
those HD cameras
can turn on you fast.

12:06.151 --> 12:08.392
Faster-than-my-ex-husband
in-the-sack fast.

12:08.446 --> 12:11.150
You know, we were wondering
about a series of phone calls

12:11.151 --> 12:12.780
that she might have gotten
while she was here.

12:12.781 --> 12:14.431
Ah. Her secret man.

12:14.725 --> 12:15.562
Secret man?

12:15.632 --> 12:17.501
Mandy was always open
about her love life,

12:17.872 --> 12:19.144
but when this guy would call,

12:19.485 --> 12:20.379
she'd leave the room.

12:20.814 --> 12:22.693
She was keeping it
on the down low.

12:22.694 --> 12:24.500
Yeah, you always think
you're being so discreet,

12:24.501 --> 12:26.263
but trust me, people know.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.938
So do you guys have
any idea who he is?

12:31.046 --> 12:33.202
Yeah.
A few weeks ago I went outside

12:33.203 --> 12:34.870
to get a nutter butter
from the vending machine,

12:35.073 --> 12:38.178
and I overheard them talking
about his big game.

12:38.348 --> 12:39.250
He's an athlete?

12:39.251 --> 12:40.433
More like an MVP

12:40.719 --> 12:43.252
of a very well-known
local basketball team.

12:43.253 --> 12:45.596
Does the number 17 ring a bell?

12:45.634 --> 12:46.482
Reggie Blake?

12:47.781 --> 12:49.020
She was dating Reggie Blake?

12:49.176 --> 12:50.289
Castle, isn't he married?

12:52.335 --> 12:53.280
Yeah, not only is he married,

12:53.281 --> 12:55.052
but rumor has it, he
has a very strict

12:55.053 --> 12:56.840
no-cheating clause
in their prenup.

12:57.316 --> 12:59.671
Based on his income, it'd be
very costly if he got a divorce.

12:59.672 --> 13:00.573
And guess what he drives.

13:00.983 --> 13:02.357
- A silver G-Wagon?
- Yep.

13:02.358 --> 13:03.248
All right, pick him up.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.968
- Make a hole. Make a hole. Give him room.
- Hey.

13:28.616 --> 13:29.547
Good to see you, Reg!

13:31.238 --> 13:32.133
Ah, thanks. Appreciate it.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.174
Oh, good to see you, man.

13:34.205 --> 13:35.039
Let me take the lead.

13:36.912 --> 13:37.517
Whatever.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.477
What? I got more experience.

13:39.598 --> 13:41.550
Yo, Javi, do you mind
if we call a time-out

13:42.186 --> 13:43.795
while we collar this guy, huh?

13:44.795 --> 13:47.343
- A'ight.
- Take care, Reggie.

13:47.617 --> 13:48.532
Reggie.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.269
Fellas. No autographs today.

13:51.451 --> 13:52.270
We're NYPD.

13:52.628 --> 13:54.392
I don't give a hobo's
crap if you're CIA.

13:54.436 --> 13:55.254
No autographs.

13:55.536 --> 13:57.391
We're not here for autographs.
We're here for Reggie.

13:57.392 --> 13:58.849
And you're obstructing
our investigation.

14:00.491 --> 14:01.219
So move.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.733
That's what I thought.

14:08.789 --> 14:09.469
Oh, hell.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.112
You're not taking
Reggie anywhere.

14:12.842 --> 14:13.591
Get out of the way, man.

14:21.422 --> 14:22.719
Shouldn't they be back by now?

14:22.926 --> 14:23.974
Well, maybe they hit traffic.

14:24.240 --> 14:24.992
Or each other.

14:25.128 --> 14:27.187
Either way, Reggie
is going down.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.263
Unis canvassed Mandy's building,

14:29.264 --> 14:31.001
and neighbors said
that they heard her

14:31.002 --> 14:33.207
in a yelling match with a guy
the day that she was killed.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.570
They said it sounded
like a lover's quarrel.

14:34.765 --> 14:37.354
Relationship goes bad, his
marriage is threatened...

14:37.355 --> 14:38.980
So Reggie threatens
her with the note.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.980
"If this gets out,
I'll kill you."

14:41.091 --> 14:43.594
She refuses to play ball, so
Reggie does what he does best--

14:44.225 --> 14:45.063
starts shooting.

15:02.713 --> 15:03.423
Don't ask.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.191
Look, man, I'm sorry.

15:06.616 --> 15:07.943
My security guys are protective.

15:08.599 --> 15:10.380
We get a lot of nut bars
hanging around the block.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.000
Apology not accepted.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.127
Now sit down.

15:17.194 --> 15:18.025
Look, I told you,

15:18.423 --> 15:20.483
I didn't have anything
to do with her murder.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.835
And yet, we have
witnesses that saw Mandy

15:22.836 --> 15:25.012
get in to your car shortly
before she was killed.

15:25.547 --> 15:27.074
We know about the
affair, Reggie.

15:27.432 --> 15:29.997
Can't imagine your wife would
be too happy if she found out,

15:29.998 --> 15:31.316
so you made sure she didn't.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.805
What are you talking
about, affair?

15:33.088 --> 15:35.366
Yeah, I knew Mandy.
So did my wife.

15:35.898 --> 15:37.247
We were friends. That's all.

15:37.254 --> 15:38.894
You really expect us to
believe that, Reggie?

15:38.895 --> 15:41.608
It's the truth.
If you don't believe me, ask my wife.

15:41.678 --> 15:42.404
Oh, we will.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.552
So I imagine it was
just a coincidence

15:44.572 --> 15:46.502
that you happened to be
driving by the hospital

15:46.503 --> 15:48.065
right after Mandy's
segment ended.

15:48.066 --> 15:50.834
No. We're both on the
hospital charity board.

15:50.837 --> 15:52.282
I was stopping by the toy drive.

15:52.842 --> 15:54.855
I'm telling you, we
were just friends.

15:55.078 --> 15:57.408
Well, there sure are a lot
of phone calls to Mandy,

15:57.658 --> 15:59.117
considering y'all
are just friends.

16:00.766 --> 16:01.732
Mandy and I...

16:03.220 --> 16:05.697
we both had a ticking
clock on our careers--

16:06.556 --> 16:07.944
her looks, my knees.

16:09.378 --> 16:11.275
It was nice to chat with
somebody who understood.

16:11.276 --> 16:13.736
Okay, say you were just friends.

16:14.184 --> 16:15.579
Why didn't she
want her coworkers

16:15.580 --> 16:16.481
to find out about you?

16:16.998 --> 16:18.654
Because that's how
rumors get started.

16:18.944 --> 16:19.969
I know what you're thinking.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.096
I'm a professional athlete,

16:21.351 --> 16:22.573
she's a blonde weather girl,

16:22.802 --> 16:23.874
but it wasn't like that.

16:23.914 --> 16:25.182
She wasn't like that.

16:26.034 --> 16:27.257
Those kids at City Of Trust,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.443
to other celebs, they
was just a photo op.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.996
Not to her. She cared.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.694
You shoulda seen her last week,

16:33.984 --> 16:34.976
asking them questions,

16:35.599 --> 16:36.825
listening to their stories.

16:38.395 --> 16:40.301
People think she's
some kind of bimbo,

16:41.141 --> 16:41.992
but she wasn't.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.055
Anyway, I-I saw her
hailing a cab.

16:45.056 --> 16:46.075
I offered her a ride.

16:46.076 --> 16:47.659
She asked to be dropped
off at the park.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.179
That happened around 10:00.

16:49.415 --> 16:50.474
Where were you at 10:28?

16:51.193 --> 16:52.496
I was across town at X Bar,

16:52.617 --> 16:53.745
promoting my new shoe line.

16:55.073 --> 16:55.928
Check it.

16:55.987 --> 16:57.158
Mandy mention why she wanted

16:57.159 --> 16:58.331
to get dropped off at the park?

16:58.675 --> 17:00.766
No. She seemed nervous.

17:01.481 --> 17:02.436
Maybe it had something to do

17:02.437 --> 17:03.728
with what happened a
couple of days ago.

17:03.748 --> 17:04.887
What happened a
couple of days ago?

17:05.281 --> 17:07.590
She called me for a ride
from the emergency room.

17:08.204 --> 17:10.060
I asked her what happened,
but she wouldn't say.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.631
Wait.
She was there as a patient?

17:11.848 --> 17:12.602
Yeah.

17:12.662 --> 17:15.200
She didn't look hurt, but
she seemed pretty upset.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.185
Do you actually buy this
whole "Just friends" thing?

17:22.704 --> 17:23.432
It's possible.

17:23.549 --> 17:25.919
Yeah, it's possible,
but it's not probable.

17:26.096 --> 17:28.249
I don't know. You and I were
just friends for four years.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.548
Yeah, except you were trying to
sleep with me that whole time.

17:30.622 --> 17:31.672
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.396 --> 17:33.055
Excuse me.

17:33.056 --> 17:35.248
It was you that was
trying to sleep with me.

17:35.272 --> 17:35.834
Wh--

17:35.849 --> 17:37.709
Don't tell me you dress
like that for Esposito.

17:38.452 --> 17:39.188
What's for me?

17:39.781 --> 17:40.681
- Nothing.
- Don't worry about it.

17:41.350 --> 17:42.574
Reggie's alibi is solid.

17:42.682 --> 17:45.329
He was already at the X Bar
buying shots for everyone

17:45.330 --> 17:46.247
when Mandy was killed.

17:46.379 --> 17:48.899
His wife confirms that they
were all just friends.

17:48.933 --> 17:49.718
In fact, she's the one

17:49.719 --> 17:51.073
who bought him that
prepaid cell phone

17:51.074 --> 17:52.380
because his was
hacked or something.

17:52.381 --> 17:53.879
Okay, then touch base
with the ER doctor

17:53.880 --> 17:55.437
that treated Mandy a
couple of days ago.

17:55.438 --> 17:56.988
Whatever landed her in emergency

17:57.211 --> 17:58.524
might have caught up
with her last night.

17:58.807 --> 18:00.793
- Hey, guys. I found out who Mandy-- 
- Yo.

18:01.688 --> 18:03.426
Are you wearing makeup?

18:05.686 --> 18:06.387
No.

18:06.635 --> 18:07.288
Really?

18:07.900 --> 18:10.309
Because an hour ago, you
and I both had black eyes,

18:10.310 --> 18:11.931
and now you don't.

18:12.322 --> 18:13.636
No, this is not makeup.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.296
This is tinted moisturizer.

18:16.421 --> 18:17.260
Jenny just stopped by,

18:17.261 --> 18:18.683
she happened to have
some in her purse,

18:18.684 --> 18:20.465
and I figured since
the, you know--

18:20.951 --> 18:22.774
Fine.
Just judge all you want.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.723
So I found out who Mandy was
fighting with at her apartment

18:25.724 --> 18:26.700
the day she died.

18:26.948 --> 18:28.261
The store across the
street from her building

18:28.262 --> 18:29.276
uses surveillance.

18:29.330 --> 18:30.454
There was no sign of Reggie,

18:30.794 --> 18:32.182
but I did see another
familiar face--

18:32.749 --> 18:35.546
WHNY reporter Miles Haxton.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.097
Yeah, that's me.

18:40.651 --> 18:41.942
So what were you
doing at her place?

18:43.014 --> 18:43.685
Mandy's neighbors

18:43.686 --> 18:45.238
overheard the two
of you fighting.

18:46.016 --> 18:46.834
What was it about?

18:48.693 --> 18:49.546
Our relationship.

18:51.027 --> 18:52.503
- You were dating?
- Mm-hmm.

18:52.908 --> 18:54.182
Why didn't you tell
us this before?

18:54.253 --> 18:55.163
'Cause I couldn't
take the chance

18:55.164 --> 18:56.029
that it would get out.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.407
The--the reporter and
the weather girl? No.

18:58.408 --> 19:01.651
This--this station has
a very strict policy

19:01.652 --> 19:02.829
about interoffice dating.

19:02.830 --> 19:04.619
And even--even with
what happened to Mandy,

19:04.620 --> 19:06.196
Harvey still would've
suspended me.

19:07.295 --> 19:09.214
How long had the two of you
been seeing each other?

19:09.550 --> 19:10.303
Couple months.

19:11.396 --> 19:12.215
What went wrong?

19:12.293 --> 19:15.455
Well, here's the thing about a
secret workplace romance, okay?

19:16.025 --> 19:18.251
In the beginning,
you're on a high.

19:18.989 --> 19:21.990
Every stolen moment feels
like a-a shot of adrenaline

19:21.991 --> 19:22.865
straight to the heart.

19:24.131 --> 19:26.842
You--you get butterflies
on your way into work.

19:26.843 --> 19:28.583
It's exciting and dangerous,

19:28.584 --> 19:31.542
and the sex is amazing.

19:35.165 --> 19:35.843
And then what?

19:36.750 --> 19:38.312
And then it imploded.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.083
We were never gonna
keep up the secret.

19:42.084 --> 19:44.091
We were already drowning in
all the lies we had to tell.

19:46.214 --> 19:48.241
Did--did your coworkers
ever find out?

19:48.801 --> 19:49.532
Uh, not yet.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.774
But I-I had to stay
out in front of it

19:51.775 --> 19:53.834
to keep it from destroying
both of our careers.

19:56.032 --> 19:58.554
I mean, I still have a-a
shot at a national desk.

19:59.204 --> 20:00.514
And Mandy didn't want it to end.

20:00.515 --> 20:02.295
She could've threatened
to tell Harvey.

20:02.591 --> 20:03.564
What? No, no.
Are you kidding?

20:03.565 --> 20:04.997
No, Mandy didn't
want this to get out

20:04.998 --> 20:06.361
any more than I did.

20:06.362 --> 20:07.715
You're not gonna tell, are you?

20:08.223 --> 20:10.129
Where were you last
night at 10:28?

20:10.130 --> 20:12.314
Uh, at a press party
at the Ritz-Carlton

20:12.315 --> 20:14.443
for the launch of the
Vega smartphone.

20:14.444 --> 20:15.906
Did Mandy say anything to you

20:15.907 --> 20:18.366
about going to the ER
a couple days ago?

20:18.367 --> 20:20.306
No, she didn't mention
it, but then again,

20:20.307 --> 20:22.424
she was acting pretty
strange last week.

20:22.425 --> 20:23.323
What do you mean?

20:23.324 --> 20:24.703
Well, she wouldn't tell
me, but I had the feeling

20:24.704 --> 20:26.882
it was more than just
us she was upset about.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.784
There's something else
that was bothering her.

20:33.126 --> 20:34.682
Well, it looks like
those makeup ladies

20:34.683 --> 20:35.728
were right about Mandy's affair,

20:35.729 --> 20:37.105
they just had the wrong guy.

20:37.106 --> 20:38.956
Castle, what about the
other stuff that they said

20:38.957 --> 20:42.664
about how secret romances are
impossible to keep hidden?

20:42.665 --> 20:43.627
I mean, you heard Miles.

20:43.628 --> 20:46.275
I don't want to drown
in a sea of lies.

20:46.276 --> 20:48.854
Well, if it's any comfort to
you, I do know mouth-to-mouth.

20:50.106 --> 20:51.172
Hey, Espo.

20:51.849 --> 20:53.094
Found something weird.

20:53.095 --> 20:54.931
The ER doc that treated Mandy?

20:54.932 --> 20:56.980
It turns out it was for
a severe asthma attack.

20:56.981 --> 20:59.294
That's not weird.
We know that Mandy had asthma.

20:59.295 --> 21:00.029
That's why she couldn't go up

21:00.030 --> 21:01.473
in the station helicopter.

21:01.474 --> 21:04.332
Which brings me to
the w-weird part.

21:04.565 --> 21:07.866
She arrived at the ER
in the WHNY news chopper.

21:07.867 --> 21:08.923
She landed on the helipad,

21:08.924 --> 21:10.746
and the pilot walked her inside.

21:11.148 --> 21:12.454
Okay. Thank you.

21:13.142 --> 21:14.285
With her asthma,

21:14.286 --> 21:15.527
what was she doing up there

21:15.528 --> 21:16.768
and why did no one
know about it?

21:16.769 --> 21:18.260
There is one person
that knew about it,

21:18.604 --> 21:19.931
the helicopter pilot.

21:21.167 --> 21:22.913
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going, pretty boy?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.654
It's 8:30. It's time for your
segment with Kristina.

21:25.886 --> 21:27.167
Gotta get you into makeup.

21:27.168 --> 21:29.059
- Um... 
- It's okay. I'll take care of it.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.199
Okay. D-don't solve
the case without me.

21:32.599 --> 21:34.943
Look, I wasn't
supposed to, okay?

21:35.758 --> 21:38.454
But a few days ago, she
showed up with an envelope

21:38.455 --> 21:40.514
stuffed with 1,000 bucks,

21:40.515 --> 21:42.173
said she needed the chopper
only for 20 minutes,

21:42.174 --> 21:43.292
and nobody could know.

21:43.506 --> 21:44.912
Did she tell you
why she needed it?

21:44.913 --> 21:46.767
No, but it must have
been important.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.453
Look, I liked Mandy.

21:49.454 --> 21:51.683
Bubbly, easy on the eyes.

21:51.684 --> 21:52.953
I wanted to help her out.

21:53.237 --> 21:55.512
But then we get up there,
she's got all this equipment,

21:55.513 --> 21:57.108
and she wants to
fly over Jersey.

21:57.413 --> 21:58.288
Why New Jersey?

21:58.289 --> 21:59.131
Beats me.

21:59.470 --> 22:01.829
All I know is, it's more fuel,
and my boss might notice.

22:01.830 --> 22:03.089
Okay, so did you do it?

22:03.090 --> 22:05.968
Yeah. We were over Jersey
for a few minutes,

22:05.969 --> 22:07.346
but then she started
breathing heavy.

22:07.347 --> 22:08.067
She didn't have her inhaler,

22:08.068 --> 22:09.503
so I flew straight
to the hospital.

22:09.504 --> 22:11.774
D-do you have any idea
what she was up to?

22:11.775 --> 22:12.502
No.

22:13.018 --> 22:14.928
When I told her I didn't
want to leave New York,

22:15.295 --> 22:17.561
she said, "It's a matter
of life or death."

22:19.300 --> 22:20.791
I guess maybe she was right.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.091
That was-- that
was the last time

22:26.092 --> 22:28.348
I took my laptop
into a coffee shop.

22:29.787 --> 22:30.724
So...

22:30.725 --> 22:32.663
as a handsome,
best-selling author,

22:32.664 --> 22:34.176
I'm sure you must have women

22:34.177 --> 22:35.985
throwing themselves
at you all the time.

22:35.986 --> 22:38.334
Well, we all have our
crosses to bear.

22:39.355 --> 22:41.530
Yes, you are such a martyr.

22:42.342 --> 22:44.492
So no one special in
your life right now?

22:47.288 --> 22:48.567
I, uh...

22:49.294 --> 22:51.594
No. Uh, actually, no.
No one special.

22:51.595 --> 22:52.731
I'm single right now.

22:52.732 --> 22:54.618
That's good, because
there's a question

22:54.619 --> 22:56.321
I've been wanting to ask you.

22:57.509 --> 22:59.335
Will you have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

23:00.119 --> 23:01.675
Oh, um...

23:02.666 --> 23:04.840
Wow. Wow. I'm flattered.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.142
But I have to decline.

23:06.143 --> 23:09.232
Come on, Castle. There's only
three seconds until commercial.

23:09.233 --> 23:09.842
I, uh, uh...

23:09.843 --> 23:11.779
Exactly. What are you waiting for?
Hello.

23:11.780 --> 23:13.290
We're gonna need an answer.

23:15.046 --> 23:16.194
No.

23:17.908 --> 23:19.384
Uh, actually, I would love to.

23:19.934 --> 23:21.286
- It's a date.
- Great.

23:22.717 --> 23:24.670
"Frozen Heat"-- it's
on bookshelves now.

23:24.671 --> 23:28.218
We'll have more with Richard
Castle after the break.

23:34.684 --> 23:37.062
I'm telling you, it's
the perfect cover.

23:37.063 --> 23:37.940
No one's gonna suspect us

23:37.941 --> 23:39.602
if they know I'm going
out with Kristina.

23:39.603 --> 23:43.113
Yo, Castle, nice work
with Coterra, bro.

23:44.226 --> 23:45.877
See? Perfect.

23:45.878 --> 23:47.881
Yeah, it's perfect.

23:47.882 --> 23:50.894
So how far do you plan on
taking this date with her?

23:50.895 --> 23:52.388
I'm taking her out
to a fancy dinner,

23:52.389 --> 23:54.313
someplace romantic where
everyone will see us,

23:54.314 --> 23:56.637
maybe even end up on "page six."

23:56.638 --> 23:57.849
How great would that be?

23:57.850 --> 23:59.822
Yeah, that'd be so--
that'd be really great.

24:00.247 --> 24:01.498
You are okay with this, right?

24:02.125 --> 24:03.897
Yeah. Yeah. Why?

24:04.221 --> 24:05.014
Just askin'.

24:06.100 --> 24:09.398
So what did we learn about
Mandy's helicopter ride?

24:10.520 --> 24:11.448
Well, we found the equipment

24:11.449 --> 24:12.863
that she used in her apartment.

24:12.864 --> 24:15.826
It turns out, it's all the stuff
she stole from Rebecca Fog.

24:16.654 --> 24:18.404
Rebecca Fog.

24:18.405 --> 24:20.078
But you mean, it wasn't a prank?

24:20.079 --> 24:21.987
I mean, she actually
used this stuff?

24:22.708 --> 24:23.289
Why?

24:23.290 --> 24:25.423
Well, we were hoping
you could tell us.

24:25.424 --> 24:26.687
Uh, well, if she was
up in the chopper,

24:26.688 --> 24:28.437
she must have been using
the direct tox monitor.

24:28.438 --> 24:30.461
The direct tox
monitor, of course.

24:30.462 --> 24:31.480
You have no idea what that is.

24:31.481 --> 24:32.566
No, not a clue.

24:32.567 --> 24:34.923
Uh, it's an instrument
to test air quality.

24:34.924 --> 24:37.696
But she was a glorified
spokesmodel.

24:37.697 --> 24:39.457
What the hell was she up to?

24:39.458 --> 24:40.856
Is there any way to find out?

24:40.857 --> 24:42.915
Yeah, the, uh, monitor
stores measured data.

24:45.833 --> 24:46.775
Whoa. Wait.

24:47.263 --> 24:48.853
- Well, this can't be right.
- What?

24:48.854 --> 24:50.814
It's indicating high
levels of styrene.

24:51.221 --> 24:52.384
And is that unusual?

24:52.385 --> 24:53.965
Yeah, styrene's a
dangerous chemical.

24:53.966 --> 24:56.647
Prolonged exposure could lead
to severe respiratory problems.

24:57.097 --> 24:58.377
Like asthma.

24:58.378 --> 25:00.550
Mandy had an asthma attack
right after she did that test.

25:00.551 --> 25:02.221
And remember Reggie's statement?

25:02.222 --> 25:03.355
He said Mandy was hanging out

25:03.356 --> 25:04.989
at the hospital with
those sick kids.

25:04.990 --> 25:06.130
Maybe there's a connection.

25:07.711 --> 25:08.875
She was really nice.

25:08.876 --> 25:09.966
She said she had asthma, too,

25:09.967 --> 25:12.013
and that it didn't
have to hold me back.

25:12.014 --> 25:14.731
When the doctors come in,
they only talk to my mom.

25:15.258 --> 25:18.428
The weather lady, she actually
wanted to talk to me.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.485
And what kinds of things
did she ask you about?

25:20.486 --> 25:23.567
Lots of things, like
school and friends.

25:23.568 --> 25:25.652
Last time, she asked me
where I played baseball.

25:25.653 --> 25:26.473
And what'd you tell her?

25:26.474 --> 25:27.667
Conway Field.

25:28.584 --> 25:30.217
Did she tell you why
she wanted to know?

25:30.582 --> 25:32.990
She thought it had something
to do with my asthma.

25:35.078 --> 25:35.837
Excuse me.

25:39.359 --> 25:41.143
Hey, so I just talked
with the mothers

25:41.144 --> 25:41.901
of all the other patients

25:41.902 --> 25:43.720
that Mandy visited
with at the hospital,

25:43.721 --> 25:44.758
and they all said
the same thing--

25:44.759 --> 25:47.164
Mandy asked them about their
practices at Conway Field.

25:47.165 --> 25:48.989
Let me guess.
Conway Field's in New Jersey.

25:48.990 --> 25:50.684
Uh, Union County to be exact.

25:50.685 --> 25:52.909
So I spoke with admissions
at the hospital,

25:52.910 --> 25:54.734
and they said that numbers
for severe asthma patients

25:54.735 --> 25:56.197
are up for that neighborhood.

25:57.353 --> 25:59.949
Well, as a weather girl
and someone with asthma,

25:59.950 --> 26:02.154
Mandy would've understood
the impact of air quality

26:02.155 --> 26:04.383
on someone with
respiratory illness.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.790
The note said, "If any of this
gets out, I'll kill you."

26:07.791 --> 26:10.753
What if Mandy found out
what or who was responsible

26:10.754 --> 26:12.050
for the styrene in the air?

26:12.051 --> 26:13.610
It's possible they
had her killed.

26:15.088 --> 26:16.558
So based on the direction
that Lenny traveled

26:16.559 --> 26:18.375
while Mandy took air samples,

26:18.376 --> 26:21.496
they flew over eight factories,
all near Conway Field.

26:21.497 --> 26:24.934
And of the eight factories,
only one produces styrene--

26:25.346 --> 26:26.256
Cazuli Carpeting.

26:26.257 --> 26:28.309
It's a chemical byproduct
of their manufacturing.

26:28.310 --> 26:31.309
And check out the bottom
of one of their bills.

26:31.533 --> 26:32.395
Look familiar?

26:33.903 --> 26:35.987
Their logo has the same design

26:35.988 --> 26:37.668
that's on the death
threat Mandy got.

26:37.669 --> 26:39.404
Yeah, and the owner
of Cazuli Carpeting,

26:39.405 --> 26:42.385
George Cazuli, is no stranger
to carrying out threats--

26:42.386 --> 26:44.231
assault and battery,
spousal abuse,

26:44.232 --> 26:45.664
and the attempted arson

26:45.665 --> 26:47.198
of one of his
competitor's factories.

26:47.199 --> 26:48.330
Well, then it all
makes perfect sense.

26:48.331 --> 26:49.913
A hotheaded factory owner

26:49.914 --> 26:52.005
is confronted by an
idealistic weather girl

26:52.006 --> 26:53.994
who accuses him of pumping
poison into the air.

26:53.995 --> 26:55.283
And if her allegations
went public,

26:55.284 --> 26:56.627
he'd face criminal charges,

26:56.628 --> 26:57.974
his factory would be shut down.

26:57.975 --> 27:00.488
Only Cazuli shuts
her down instead.

27:02.073 --> 27:03.930
Mr. Cazuli, have a seat.

27:04.522 --> 27:05.566
I've seen enough episodes

27:05.567 --> 27:07.364
of "Law & Order" to
know how this works.

27:07.676 --> 27:08.870
You think you're gonna trick me

27:08.871 --> 27:10.358
into saying something
that ain't true?

27:10.739 --> 27:11.888
I'll tell you what,

27:11.889 --> 27:14.202
I ain't saying another word
till my lawyer gets here.

27:15.576 --> 27:16.160
Not a problem.

27:16.161 --> 27:17.924
Mr. Castle and I will
just use that time

27:17.925 --> 27:20.856
to go through your file
before your lawyer gets here.

27:23.005 --> 27:25.099
Oh, yeah. That'll be helpful.

27:25.865 --> 27:28.329
- That's a thick file, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

27:28.330 --> 27:29.757
Okay, let's see.

27:29.758 --> 27:32.480
Six months ago, Cazuli
modified their carpet backing

27:32.481 --> 27:35.291
to create a
longer-lasting product.

27:35.292 --> 27:36.790
Who doesn't want
longer-lasting carpet?

27:36.791 --> 27:40.245
Yes, but unfortunately,
this process

27:40.246 --> 27:42.559
released a harmful
chemical called styrene.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.090
Now that's normal
in small doses,

27:44.091 --> 27:45.883
but in the case of
Cazuli's factory,

27:45.884 --> 27:48.140
they were way over
the legal limit.

27:48.141 --> 27:49.220
Well, that's terrible.

27:49.221 --> 27:50.262
Did Mr. Cazuli know?

27:50.263 --> 27:52.592
You know, it's hard to imagine
that he didn't, right?

27:52.593 --> 27:53.605
Anyway, according to this,

27:53.606 --> 27:55.581
local weather girl
Mandy Michaels

27:55.582 --> 27:57.934
made a connection between
elevated levels of styrene

27:57.935 --> 28:00.357
and an increase in asthma cases.

28:00.358 --> 28:02.451
This is not sounding
good for Cazuli.

28:02.452 --> 28:04.627
You know, I wonder if he was
aware she was looking into this.

28:04.628 --> 28:05.671
As a matter of fact,

28:05.672 --> 28:07.248
a receptionist at
Cazuli Carpeting

28:07.249 --> 28:08.371
went on record saying that

28:08.372 --> 28:10.417
Mandy showed up at the
factory a few days ago.

28:10.418 --> 28:12.766
And I bet you she went
there to confront Cazuli.

28:12.767 --> 28:15.583
Cazuli had to know that the cost
of shutting down production

28:15.584 --> 28:17.641
to address the problem
would've been sky-high.

28:17.642 --> 28:18.485
You know, that explains

28:18.486 --> 28:20.029
the threatening note
that Mandy got.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.304
"If any of this gets
out, I will kill you"?

28:22.632 --> 28:24.047
Hey, this matches exactly

28:24.048 --> 28:25.701
the Cazuli Carpeting stationery.

28:25.702 --> 28:27.150
That's why she was at the park.

28:27.151 --> 28:28.560
The Environmental
Protection Agency's

28:28.561 --> 28:29.376
right around the corner.

28:29.377 --> 28:30.484
You know what?
You might be right about that.

28:30.485 --> 28:32.402
When I called them,
they confirmed

28:32.403 --> 28:33.644
that Mandy was on her way there

28:33.645 --> 28:35.576
to drop something in
the after-hours box.

28:35.577 --> 28:38.055
I think Cazuli killed her to
keep her from turning him in.

28:38.056 --> 28:39.086
All right, enough!

28:39.590 --> 28:40.650
This broad was sticking her nose

28:40.651 --> 28:42.871
into something that was
none of her business.

28:42.872 --> 28:44.655
She shows up, she's all
high, she's all mighty

28:44.656 --> 28:47.261
with her stupid-ass file of
evidence, and I told her,

28:47.262 --> 28:49.503
I told her to "Scram, get
outta here, beat it!

28:49.504 --> 28:50.914
"And if I ever see
your face around here,

28:50.915 --> 28:51.655
you're gonna regret it."

28:51.656 --> 28:52.430
I told her.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.830
She says to me, if I don't
close everything down,

28:54.831 --> 28:56.363
she's gonna expose us.

28:56.364 --> 28:57.810
The friggin' note--

28:57.811 --> 28:59.716
the note was to scare
her away a little bit.

28:59.717 --> 29:01.658
Seemed to work, right?
'Cause I never heard from her again.

29:01.659 --> 29:02.863
Come on. Give me a break.

29:02.864 --> 29:04.496
I thought this mess
was over with.

29:04.497 --> 29:06.270
Thank you, Mr. Cazuli.

29:06.271 --> 29:07.518
Oh, yeah. For what?

29:07.519 --> 29:08.928
For admitting to motive

29:08.929 --> 29:10.211
and to threatening Mandy.

29:10.212 --> 29:10.902
What?

29:11.981 --> 29:13.312
He's all yours, counselor.

29:15.063 --> 29:15.877
Where you been?

29:19.502 --> 29:21.285
Cazuli's lawyer is
looking for a plea

29:21.286 --> 29:22.784
on the styrene violation.

29:22.785 --> 29:23.862
What about the murder rap?

29:23.863 --> 29:24.687
Claims he's innocent.

29:24.688 --> 29:26.028
Yeah, but unfortunately,
we got nothing

29:26.029 --> 29:27.909
that places Cazuli there
the night of the murder.

29:27.910 --> 29:29.856
Look, if we can't
physically tie him to it,

29:29.857 --> 29:31.876
then all we have is speculation.

29:31.877 --> 29:33.458
Without evidence,
he's gonna walk.

29:33.459 --> 29:35.583
Hey. There's something you're
gonna want to take a look at.

29:35.584 --> 29:38.026
Search warrant came through
on Cazuli's office.

29:38.027 --> 29:40.808
We found the file that
Mandy left with him.

29:40.809 --> 29:42.408
Now in her research

29:42.653 --> 29:44.638
is this picture of
their smokestack.

29:44.882 --> 29:46.339
It looks like it was
taken at street level.

29:46.340 --> 29:48.584
Exactly.
Now take a look at the timestamp.

29:48.585 --> 29:49.923
This picture was
taken last Tuesday

29:49.924 --> 29:52.011
at 5:47 PM.

29:52.012 --> 29:53.662
Based on the
position of the sun,

29:53.663 --> 29:55.956
- tech confirmed that the time was correct.
- Meaning what?

29:55.957 --> 29:58.033
Meaning unless Mandy could
be at two places at once,

29:58.034 --> 29:59.589
she couldn't have
taken that photo.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.351
She was on air at 5:47.

30:01.352 --> 30:02.586
So who took the picture.

30:02.641 --> 30:04.257
She had a partner.

30:04.258 --> 30:07.257
Which is why Mandy told
Cazuli "they'd" expose him.

30:07.258 --> 30:08.140
Well, if she had a partner,

30:08.141 --> 30:09.525
then why haven't
they come forward?

30:09.526 --> 30:10.910
Maybe they're afraid of Cazuli.

30:10.911 --> 30:11.623
If we can find them,

30:11.624 --> 30:13.807
they might have some info
on Cazuli that'll nail him.

30:13.808 --> 30:16.101
You know what? Why don't we
order dinner and work through?

30:17.938 --> 30:19.167
Wait a minute. Castle.

30:19.168 --> 30:21.326
Don't you have a date with
Kristina Coterra tonight?

30:21.327 --> 30:22.787
Yes, I do.

30:24.321 --> 30:25.987
And--oh, crap! I'm late.

30:25.988 --> 30:27.607
Yeah, well, don't
let us keep you.

30:28.885 --> 30:31.781
Uh, are you sure you're okay--
are you okay with this?

30:31.782 --> 30:34.533
Okay? Are you kidding?
It's Kristina Coterra.

30:34.534 --> 30:36.250
Yeah, besides, since when
have you let cop work

30:36.251 --> 30:37.967
get in the way of your
busy social life?

30:37.968 --> 30:41.901
Yeah, I mean, go.
Enjoy your date.

30:42.561 --> 30:43.367
Right.

30:43.513 --> 30:44.320
Okay.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.239
- I'll call you later.
- Mm.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.124
To check on the case.

30:49.956 --> 30:51.283
Okay, guys, let's just get...

30:51.284 --> 30:53.847
back... to work.

31:07.592 --> 31:08.942
Surprise.

31:08.943 --> 31:10.617
What are you--how--I--

31:10.618 --> 31:12.066
I thought we were meeting
at the restaurant?

31:12.067 --> 31:13.976
I know, but this is so
much more romantic--

31:13.977 --> 31:15.641
you, me...

31:16.116 --> 31:17.623
Some oysters.

31:17.624 --> 31:19.692
Oh, wow.
You got oysters in there?

31:19.693 --> 31:21.105
To get us in the mood.

31:21.106 --> 31:24.072
Also some chocolate-covered
strawberries.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.572
I...

31:33.100 --> 31:34.678
Well, I spoke with
everyone at the station,

31:34.679 --> 31:35.972
including her boyfriend.

31:35.973 --> 31:37.679
No one admits to
being the partner

31:37.680 --> 31:39.388
or even knowing what
she was working on.

31:39.389 --> 31:41.377
There's nothing in her
phone records either.

31:45.792 --> 31:48.185
Yeah, well, there's gotta be
something that we're missing.

31:48.186 --> 31:49.649
Speaking of missing something,

31:50.150 --> 31:53.581
Castle should be way more
excited about his date tonight.

31:53.784 --> 31:54.623
Why?

31:54.761 --> 31:55.951
According to
"Celebrity Examiner,"

31:55.952 --> 31:58.494
Kristina is notorious
for seducing famous men

31:58.495 --> 32:00.346
with her extensive
bikini collection.

32:04.416 --> 32:06.138
What? Jenny buys it,
and it just happened

32:06.139 --> 32:07.563
to be open to that page
on the coffee table.

32:07.564 --> 32:08.312
What's your point?

32:08.313 --> 32:09.173
Isn't it obvious?

32:09.174 --> 32:11.106
She's totally gonna
put the moves on him.

32:11.107 --> 32:13.061
No way. Not gonna happen.

32:13.062 --> 32:15.637
Thank you for actually
showing some maturity.

32:15.638 --> 32:18.537
He's totally gonna put
the moves on her.

32:19.170 --> 32:20.376
Don't you guys think
that he's actually

32:20.377 --> 32:22.272
evolved beyond that by now?

32:22.273 --> 32:25.064
He's a man, he has a pulse, so...

32:25.338 --> 32:26.441
No.

32:36.262 --> 32:37.555
You know,

32:37.797 --> 32:41.100
ever since I saw you
on that red carpet--

32:41.101 --> 32:43.005
mm, that face of yours--

32:43.006 --> 32:44.559
I have been waiting to do this.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.944
Well, if you've been waiting

32:45.945 --> 32:48.645
that long, why not wait
a few minutes more?

32:49.406 --> 32:50.220
Where you going?

32:50.221 --> 32:51.934
To the fridge to put
away these strawberries.

32:51.935 --> 32:53.635
Wouldn't want the
chocolate to melt.

32:54.954 --> 32:58.393
I can think of a better
use for that chocolate.

32:58.394 --> 32:59.103
Ha!

32:59.104 --> 33:00.720
Okay.

33:00.721 --> 33:03.607
Kristina, let's talk
about this for a second.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.239
Oh, you want to talk?

33:07.240 --> 33:08.904
Well, I just-- what are we--

33:08.905 --> 33:11.404
what are we-- what
are we doing here?

33:15.259 --> 33:17.284
Hey, Castle. How's your date?

33:17.285 --> 33:18.534
What are you--

33:18.877 --> 33:20.375
Oh!

33:20.376 --> 33:21.791
Get back. Get back. Aah!

33:21.792 --> 33:23.227
Castle?

33:25.089 --> 33:26.297
Ooh.

33:27.566 --> 33:29.115
Don't worry.

33:29.604 --> 33:31.312
I got it.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.739
Ah! Okay, I'll help. I'll help.

33:38.407 --> 33:41.704
Hi, you've reached Richard Castle.
Lucky you.

33:55.728 --> 33:57.174
Now that that's out of the way,

33:57.175 --> 33:58.297
where were we?

33:58.298 --> 33:59.943
Um, um...

34:00.763 --> 34:01.934
oysters.

34:01.935 --> 34:03.383
Ooh, let's skip the oysters.

34:03.384 --> 34:04.803
Really? 'Cause I happen to be--

34:04.804 --> 34:06.394
Why are you playing
so hard to get?

34:06.395 --> 34:07.702
I'm really not. I just--

34:07.703 --> 34:09.601
- You are.
- Whoa.

34:09.601 --> 34:11.824
You know, no man has
ever said no to me.

34:11.824 --> 34:14.208
Well... there was one.

34:14.338 --> 34:16.038
Really? That sounds like
an interesting story.

34:16.039 --> 34:18.389
Tell me about him.
How did he get away?

34:18.389 --> 34:19.690
I assure you...

34:20.058 --> 34:22.177
it had nothing to do with me.

34:22.889 --> 34:25.603
Oh, wow.

34:27.628 --> 34:29.001
Oh!

34:36.583 --> 34:38.083
Castle?

34:40.585 --> 34:42.695
I, uh...

34:43.168 --> 34:45.085
uh, I know who the killer is.

34:52.831 --> 34:54.702
Look, I tried
everything to get away.

34:54.703 --> 34:56.310
I-I hid under the counter.

34:56.311 --> 34:57.535
I was hiding in the bathroom.

34:57.536 --> 34:58.461
At one point, I tried to pull

34:58.462 --> 34:59.872
a "Cape Fear" up
under the piano.

34:59.873 --> 35:02.939
Yet when I walked in, she was
straddling you on the couch.

35:02.940 --> 35:05.071
Right? She's like the
Terminator of sexpots.

35:05.072 --> 35:06.324
What is that even
supposed to mean,

35:06.325 --> 35:07.811
she just keeps on coming?

35:07.812 --> 35:08.998
No, I--that's...

35:11.723 --> 35:12.696
The only reason

35:12.697 --> 35:14.356
I went on the date
in the first place

35:14.357 --> 35:17.829
was because you made a big deal
about being single in public.

35:17.830 --> 35:20.230
Castle, I have 12
missed phone calls

35:20.231 --> 35:21.423
from Chip the sportscaster

35:21.424 --> 35:23.055
because he thinks
that I'm single,

35:23.056 --> 35:23.705
but that doesn't mean

35:23.706 --> 35:25.786
that I'm gonna let him
mount me in his speedos

35:25.787 --> 35:27.401
just to prove it.

35:27.946 --> 35:29.360
You didn't tell me he called.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.594
Really? You're gonna play
the jealousy card now?

35:31.595 --> 35:33.330
Okay, look, I'll make it
up to you, all right?

35:33.331 --> 35:34.481
Whatever you want.

35:34.482 --> 35:35.634
What I want is not to have

35:35.635 --> 35:37.049
this image of a
bikini-clad woman

35:37.050 --> 35:38.470
stuffing her boobs in your face.

35:38.471 --> 35:39.941
So good luck with that.

35:39.942 --> 35:42.016
Don't I even get credit for
figuring out who the killer is?

35:42.017 --> 35:42.695
No.

35:42.696 --> 35:45.800
Later in the week, we'll
be seeing a warming trend.

35:54.392 --> 35:56.177
Mr. Haxton.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.863
Can we have a word?

35:57.864 --> 35:59.747
Uh, I'm about to go
live with a story.

35:59.748 --> 36:00.762
So are we.

36:03.685 --> 36:05.935
I just had a very
interesting conversation

36:05.936 --> 36:07.198
with Kristina Coterra.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.734
She told me that you
are the one man

36:09.735 --> 36:11.801
who's rejected her
advances in the past.

36:11.802 --> 36:14.859
Yep, the one man.

36:15.946 --> 36:17.591
Well, I don't see how
that's relevant.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.280
Well, her pride was hurt

36:19.281 --> 36:20.844
so she did a little digging.

36:21.055 --> 36:23.185
Turns out, you did have
a secret relationship,

36:23.186 --> 36:25.430
just not with Mandy.

36:25.896 --> 36:27.556
She discovered you
have a boyfriend

36:27.557 --> 36:29.154
that no one here knows about.

36:34.161 --> 36:37.255
Well, my... personal life's
none of your business.

36:37.256 --> 36:39.092
Normally, yes, but it
became our business

36:39.093 --> 36:40.633
when we found out
that you lied to us

36:40.634 --> 36:42.351
about why you were
at Mandy's apartment

36:42.352 --> 36:44.971
and about what you
were fighting over.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.215
Now did you take this photo?

36:47.216 --> 36:47.768
No.

36:47.769 --> 36:48.580
Wow, that's funny.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.905
Because a search of your
apartment turned up a camera

36:50.906 --> 36:52.463
with this and other
photos on it.

36:52.464 --> 36:53.839
She was your partner.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.145
She was helping
you with a story,

36:55.146 --> 36:56.514
so why didn't you come forward?

36:56.515 --> 36:58.274
Well, there's only one
conceivable reason--

36:58.275 --> 37:00.405
because you killed her.

37:02.786 --> 37:05.124
She was a colleague
and a friend.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.558
Why would I kill her?

37:06.559 --> 37:09.449
Because she uncovered the
expose of a lifetime.

37:09.450 --> 37:11.951
A story that big, it has
to be vetted by legal,

37:11.952 --> 37:13.916
that can take weeks,
even months.

37:13.917 --> 37:15.280
But Mandy couldn't
wait that long,

37:15.281 --> 37:16.770
not while kids
were getting sick.

37:16.771 --> 37:19.474
So she decided to turn the
findings over to the EPA.

37:19.475 --> 37:20.747
At which point,

37:20.748 --> 37:22.704
you lose your big exclusive.

37:22.986 --> 37:24.216
Now when was the last time

37:24.217 --> 37:26.072
you had a big exclusive?

37:26.073 --> 37:27.702
This is crazy.

37:27.703 --> 37:28.662
No, this is crazy.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.769
You--you think I killed
someone for a story.

37:31.770 --> 37:33.399
We know it was you, Miles.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.968
We found gunshot residue on
the clothes in your hamper,

37:36.969 --> 37:38.934
on the ski mask,

37:39.248 --> 37:40.565
the shirt.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.593
You have to understand...

37:56.785 --> 37:58.684
It was an accident.

38:00.658 --> 38:02.486
I only meant to scare her.

38:03.837 --> 38:06.047
I thought if I could just
get those files back,

38:06.048 --> 38:07.043
I could stop her.

38:07.044 --> 38:11.130
I'd be able to break the
story like she promised.

38:12.131 --> 38:13.975
But she fought me.

38:14.856 --> 38:18.486
She fought me, and she went
and grabbed for the gun.

38:18.487 --> 38:19.415
Why would she fight me?

38:19.416 --> 38:22.454
I mean, I-I didn't even
know the gun was loaded.

38:25.562 --> 38:27.039
Well, the station
manager confirmed,

38:27.040 --> 38:28.727
Miles was on thin ice.

38:28.728 --> 38:30.046
The only way he could
save his career

38:30.047 --> 38:31.721
was to break a splashy story,

38:31.722 --> 38:33.670
so he made a deal with
Mandy to help her

38:33.671 --> 38:35.134
in exchange for the exclusive.

38:35.135 --> 38:37.010
Right, and then when
she betrayed him,

38:37.011 --> 38:39.426
he snuck out of the press
party to confront her,

38:39.427 --> 38:41.443
and then things just
got back from there.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.379
I've gotta say,

38:42.380 --> 38:44.702
pretty brave of Mandy
to take up that cause.

38:44.703 --> 38:46.532
Not what you'd expect from
what people said about her.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.718
It's funny how her coworkers
thought they knew her so well,

38:48.719 --> 38:49.996
and she had this
whole secret life

38:49.997 --> 38:51.142
she was hiding from 'em.

38:52.628 --> 38:53.547
Yeah.

38:54.155 --> 38:55.968
It's late.
I'm gonna get outta here.

38:55.969 --> 38:57.391
Yeah, me, too.

38:57.392 --> 38:58.473
Walk you out?

38:58.474 --> 39:01.475
Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.

39:02.354 --> 39:03.288
Good night, guys.

39:03.289 --> 39:04.586
- Good night.
- Night.

39:11.938 --> 39:13.350
Well, good night.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.707
Good night. Night, Castle.

39:18.398 --> 39:19.131
Look.

39:19.270 --> 39:20.682
It's Reggie.

39:21.372 --> 39:23.040
And finally, here is number one

39:23.041 --> 39:25.521
on this week's top ten
sports moments of the week--

39:25.522 --> 39:27.834
this one sent in from
a Reggie Blake fan.

39:27.835 --> 39:29.047
This is what happens
when you try

39:29.048 --> 39:30.861
to barge through
to see the Blake.

39:33.276 --> 39:35.820
Aah!

39:38.918 --> 39:40.387
Yeah, I'm guessing
those eager fans

39:40.388 --> 39:42.604
did not get an autograph.

39:42.605 --> 39:45.272
Yo. You took that punch for me.

39:46.986 --> 39:48.853
You didn't have to do that.

39:48.889 --> 39:51.959
Well, it's what
partners do, right?

39:56.239 --> 39:58.703
Come on. Let's go get a beer.

39:59.026 --> 40:00.291
I'm buying.

40:00.292 --> 40:01.146
Cool.

40:02.091 --> 40:04.214
Uh, anywhere but a sports bar.

40:04.409 --> 40:06.356
Definitely not a sports bar.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.299
I'm sorry.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.826
I'm sorry.
I should not have gone on that date.

40:23.827 --> 40:25.689
I-I... I should've said no.

40:25.690 --> 40:26.841
Then why didn't you?

40:26.842 --> 40:29.205
Well, I'm no good at this.
Pretending to be single--

40:29.206 --> 40:31.020
Yeah, but, Castle, neither am I.

40:31.255 --> 40:32.482
And the last thing I want to do

40:32.483 --> 40:34.387
is have to worry about
you with other women.

40:34.388 --> 40:37.883
Well, uh, for the record, I-I
wasn't gonna sleep with her.

40:38.682 --> 40:39.864
I know.

40:41.310 --> 40:42.418
Look, that's not even the point.

40:42.419 --> 40:43.679
The point is, is...

40:44.217 --> 40:46.668
I don't even know
how to do this.

40:47.576 --> 40:49.240
Do you remember when
Miles said that

40:49.241 --> 40:51.563
it's inevitable that
this will fall apart,

40:51.564 --> 40:54.931
that it's destined to implode?

40:54.932 --> 40:56.630
Uh, just a reminder,

40:56.631 --> 40:59.087
Miles is a lying killer.

40:59.088 --> 40:59.927
But...

41:00.209 --> 41:01.805
Okay, maybe people find out,

41:01.806 --> 41:04.210
and maybe we won't get
to work together,

41:04.211 --> 41:05.374
and maybe we'll implode.

41:05.375 --> 41:09.191
Or maybe we'll continue
to be amazing.

41:10.248 --> 41:12.028
The point is, we don't
have the answers.

41:12.029 --> 41:14.845
We just have to live with
the questions and...

41:15.263 --> 41:16.931
find our way.

41:19.487 --> 41:21.251
Okay, can...

41:22.794 --> 41:24.142
Well, can we just
start here then?

41:24.143 --> 41:26.697
Can we say that we will talk
about dating other people,

41:26.698 --> 41:29.338
but we won't actually
date other people?

41:29.339 --> 41:30.767
Yeah. I--no, I can do that.

41:30.768 --> 41:32.136
Okay, good, because
I have a gun,

41:32.137 --> 41:33.317
and you don't really
have a choice.

41:33.318 --> 41:34.540
Clearly, I don't have a choice.

41:34.541 --> 41:35.305
No.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.232
Mm.

41:41.713 --> 41:42.949
I'm sorry.

41:42.950 --> 41:44.135
I can't.

41:44.627 --> 41:45.984
It's--it's too soon.

41:46.155 --> 41:49.138
I just--I keep seeing
her boobs in your face.
