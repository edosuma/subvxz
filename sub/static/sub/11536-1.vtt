02:49.640 --> 02:52.552
Is it me
or is the smell getting worse down there?

02:52.640 --> 02:55.712
I told you before,
it changes from one area to the next

02:55.800 --> 02:57.756
This is actually the fresh part.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.552
Fresh?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.393
It's like, how many different ways can shit stink?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.835
It depends which area you're in.

03:05.920 --> 03:11.597
If you're in the sewers under Chinatown,
there's a strange kind of seafood smell to it all.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.389
- Whereas in Soho, you've got...
- Stop right there.

03:15.480 --> 03:19.837
This ain't the fucking Discovery Channel.
I only need to know the basics, man.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.876
I'm just trying to educate you.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.838
Trust me,
there's nothing I want to know about shit.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.599
Now...this is the kind of thing
we're on the look for.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.076
You see... if this ain't cleared,

03:35.160 --> 03:39.870
the people upstairs are gonna be trading turds
through their kitchen sinks.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.588
- What is it?
- It's shit.

03:44.680 --> 03:49.629
Tampons, condoms -
pretty much anything that'll fit down a toilet.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.032
And since you're the new boy...

03:52.120 --> 03:54.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, all right. I got it.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.357
I swear to God, man... if it wasn't for my little girl...

04:03.480 --> 04:06.950
..I'd tell 'em to shove the parole up their arse.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.353
Mother... fucker'.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.795
What are you laughing at, man?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.713
- I could catch the plague or something.
- You just might.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.232
What was that?

04:30.240 --> 04:32.708
- What was that?
- It's just echoes.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.756
Echoes? From what?

04:36.520 --> 04:37.953
The zoo?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.877
Very funny.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.229
So what did you get sent to prison for
in the first place?

04:46.360 --> 04:48.316
What?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.436
I said, what did you get sent down for.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.549
A fucking travesty, that's what.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.713
I mean, I get sent down for dealing weed
and that shit's legal now.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.598
If I got busted now for what I had on me then,

05:00.680 --> 05:03.148
they would have thrown it down the drain
and not me.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.119
Oh, you're a drug dealer.
The chap I had last week was a pimp.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.310
- Now what?
- I don't know.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.119
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know.

05:27.200 --> 05:32.672
I haven't been down this tunnel for about a year,
but this wasn't here. I'd have reported it.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.953
This is amazing.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.871
Am I missing something here?

05:40.600 --> 05:42.511
- I've got a new tunnel.
- So?

05:42.600 --> 05:49.438
Well, so - I've been walking these tunnels
for 20 years and now I've got a new one.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.638
Well, if that's what does it for you, I'm scared.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.517
Let's take a look.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.319
I ain't going down there! That shit's too deep.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.794
- What's the matter with you?
- I can't swim.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.678
And I don't share your interest
in pipes and tunnels.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.194
All right. You...stay there.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.312
Yeah. You go for it, Sherlock

06:45.920 --> 06:47.512
Arthur?

06:48.520 --> 06:50.476
Are you OK, Arthur?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.196
You better not be fucking with me.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.194
Shit.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.958
Arthur?

07:30.680 --> 07:32.193
Oh, yeah.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.430
OK, I get it, I get it.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.592
Forgive me...

07:51.400 --> 07:52.833
Arthur.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.353
Arthur'.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.399
Arthur, mate.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.674
Arthur.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.313
What did you see?

08:30.880 --> 08:32.836
Have you seen Jemma?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.596
Hey, Kate. How are you doing?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.831
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.915
- Hey.
- Hey, boys.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.355
- Have you seen Jemma?
- Yeah, yeah, I have.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.036
She's in the back.... office.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.350
Now, why did I have a feeling you would know?

09:02.440 --> 09:05.000
Because you have a lot of feelings for me, Kate.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.719
No, I have two. Pity and disgust.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.598
I hope you remember that
when you're trying to score later.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.671
What, I have to flirt with you to get a line?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.432
Just a few compliments maybe.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.910
- Guy, I'd rather sniff glue.
- Where are you going after this, Kate?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.072
- Why, what are you doing?
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.199
Well, why don't you make a list of possibilities
so I know where to avoid?

09:26.200 --> 09:29.875
- She'll be back.....
- Yeah. Looks like you nailed that one, mate.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.276
- Hey.
- That dress is amazing.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.076
Where's the party and why aren't I invited?

09:43.160 --> 09:46.357
- Jemma and I are on a secret mission tonight.
- Go on.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.829
Two words. George Clooney.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.831
What, he's in town?

09:51.920 --> 09:54.229
Yep. And I know where he's hanging out tonight.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.797
Are you gonna try to pull him?

09:56.880 --> 10:00.077
Oh, my God, no. I'm iust gonna ask
for his autograph! What do you think?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.752
So, what are you gonna say?

10:02.800 --> 10:05.030
I don't know. I haven't got that far with the plan.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.795
But, you know what? In the end, he's a man.
Men are simple creatures.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.312
Watch this. Guy.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.676
See? So simple.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.671
Karen, Kate's gonna shag George Clooney.

10:19.320 --> 10:23.233
I know where he's hanging out tonight
and Jemma has tickets to the VlP lounge

10:23.320 --> 10:27.154
- and hopefully nature's gonna run its course.
- But Jemma's already left.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.834
- What are you talking about?
- I put her in a cab.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.229
- Don't joke.
- I swear to God.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.468
Kate, please - tell me you're still going.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.233
Taxi!

10:48.280 --> 10:49.838
Taxi!

10:54.280 --> 10:56.032
Spare us some change, please.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.756
This machine dispenses notes.

10:59.840 --> 11:03.230
If you're looking for change,
why don't you hang round a phone box?

11:10.120 --> 11:13.999
TANNOY:..on the Northern Line.
between Charing Cross and Golders Green

11:14.080 --> 11:17.959
and between Euston and East Finchley
in both directions.

11:28.760 --> 11:33.470
It's exact money only. It's not giving change.
You'll have to go to the booth.

11:34.840 --> 11:39.277
Do you have any change? I don't care
if it's the correct amount. I'm in a real rush.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.113
No, I'm sorry. You'll have to go to the booth.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.191
Are you enjoying this?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.271
I just want to get to the machine.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.193
- Excuse me, do you need a Travelcard?
- Yes, I do. How much?

11:49.280 --> 11:51.510
- Â£1.50.
- I'll give you 20.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.068
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely. 1 00%.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.230
It's illegal to buy off tramps anyway.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.833
Thanks very much.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.078
Hello?

14:46.480 --> 14:48.436
Hello? Hello?

14:58.880 --> 14:59.995
Scheisse.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.478
Hello?

15:12.680 --> 15:14.238
Hello?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.758
Hello?

16:45.320 --> 16:46.878
Hello?

16:51.120 --> 16:53.315
Anybody in there?

16:57.160 --> 16:58.479
Hello?

17:00.440 --> 17:01.668
Hello?

17:16.680 --> 17:19.990
Excuse me. I fell asleep on the platform.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.114
Don't you checkthem before you lock up?

17:27.359 --> 17:28.839
Huh?

17:28.920 --> 17:32.469
I mean, it's a little weird to me.
There's nobody in charge here?

17:34.960 --> 17:38.794
Excuse me, do you mind answering me?
You're starting to freak me out.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.832
Well, fine. My boyfriend's up the front.
I'll just go get him.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.751
Kate, it's me. It's Guy.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.796
Guy? You scared me to death.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.235
I'm sorry. I was just playing with you. that's all.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.914
Hang on - what are you doing here?

18:02.000 --> 18:05.436
What do you mean, what am I doing here?
This is what you wanted.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.669
What?

18:06.760 --> 18:10.036
Come on. You wanted me to come tonight.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.836
What are you talking about?

18:12.920 --> 18:15.115
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.393
Guy, you're mentally ill, do you know that?

18:20.440 --> 18:21.589
Freak.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.830
- Kate, where are you going?
- Out of here.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.273
Good luck....

18:25.360 --> 18:27.635
Now, what's that supposed to mean?

18:27.720 --> 18:30.393
I think we might be here till morning, that's all.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.390
No.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.870
- You might, we won't.
- You could always look on the bright side.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.036
How much of that have you had?

18:39.120 --> 18:41.076
Not much. There's plenty left.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.068
Want some?

18:43.160 --> 18:45.116
No, I don't.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.076
Hello?

18:49.160 --> 18:50.991
Did you kill the driver...?

18:54.800 --> 18:58.679
I don't think any knight in shining armour's
going to come and rescue you, Kate.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.756
Now. what say you take that dress off?

19:06.880 --> 19:09.440
- What did you just say?
- Come on. you heard me.

19:11.480 --> 19:16.315
Yeah, I did hear you but I'm going to forget what
you said because you're not thinking straight.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.551
I am thinking straight.
It's you that's confused, Kate.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.596
What are you doing?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.671
I'm iust breaking the ice.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.795
Come on. Admit that you want my dick

19:31.440 --> 19:33.396
You're joking, right?

19:33.480 --> 19:35.436
But you like it, don't you?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.156
I don't know what to say.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.116
it's like a penis, just smaller.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.954
- What are you...
- Don't fuck with me.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.712
What are you doing?

19:54.000 --> 19:57.356
- Get off me!
- You fucking bitch!

19:58.640 --> 20:01.108
Stop it! Get off!

20:06.680 --> 20:07.795
Guy!

20:11.200 --> 20:12.997
No! No!

20:14.520 --> 20:16.476
No!

20:25.800 --> 20:27.518
Guy?

20:30.320 --> 20:31.673
Guy?

20:37.040 --> 20:38.359
Run.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.998
What?

22:01.040 --> 22:02.996
Come on. No.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.635
Hello! I'm trapped in here!

22:25.040 --> 22:26.598
Hello!

22:28.040 --> 22:29.598
Hello.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.397
Oh.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.551
I know you. Hi.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.840
Oh, wait. Wait a second. Wait.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.637
Wait.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.589
Hello?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.553
Hello?

24:27.120 --> 24:28.599
Hello?

24:31.280 --> 24:32.633
Hello?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.154
- Who's there?
- Jimmy, what's going on? Who is it?

24:35.240 --> 24:37.993
- Turn the fucking light on.
- I'm sorry. I'm stuck down here.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.789
- Who is it, Jim?
- I gave you Â£20 for the Travelcard, remember?

24:43.560 --> 24:45.630
Do you want your money back or something?

24:45.720 --> 24:50.077
Oh, no, no, no. I'm stuck down here.
I got locked in. Someone's chasing me.

24:52.640 --> 24:56.758
She's fucked. You'll not get any sense out of
her. You'll be lucky to get any sense out of me.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.229
Look.... someone's been attacked, OK?

24:59.320 --> 25:03.279
- What are you going on about?
- I got stuck on a train with this guy from work

25:03.360 --> 25:05.316
And he was attacking me.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.358
- What, the guy from work?
- Yeah. He went crazy and he...

25:08.440 --> 25:13.309
He was...he was trying to rape me and then
the train doors opened and someone got him.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.960
What do you mean they got him?

25:16.040 --> 25:18.349
Pulled him off me! And...I don't know...

25:18.440 --> 25:21.000
Hey, hey, all right, all right. What's your name?

25:21.880 --> 25:23.836
- Kate.
- Kate. AII right. Kate.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.152
Well, look, I'm Jimmy, right?
My wee beautiful wee lady here - this is Mandy.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.755
- Have you got a cigarette?
- Yeah, but...

25:31.840 --> 25:35.469
No, no, nay buts, all right.
Let's just have a cigarette, all right.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.509
- Have a seat.
- OK. I'll have a seat.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.798
OK

26:05.000 --> 26:07.309
First off, you can't get out of here at night.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.391
- What?
- It's true.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.789
O nce you're in, you're in. It's totally locked up.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.028
But...isn't there a guard?

26:16.120 --> 26:19.317
There's one in the control room,
but we're not messing with him.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.551
- What do you mean? Why not?
- Cos he don't mess with us.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.596
There's a maniac out there.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.636
Nah, you don't know that.

26:26.720 --> 26:30.633
It sounds to me like some vigilante train driver's
got a wee bit carried away.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.757
The way I see it, you should be thanking him
not running away.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.435
No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea.
You didn't see what he did to Guy.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.999
The rapist?

26:39.080 --> 26:41.036
You got a fag, Jim?

26:42.880 --> 26:47.112
I'm telling you...
something is not right down here.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.715
There's a lot ofthings not right down here,
sweetheart.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.358
Can I have a fag. Jim?

26:53.960 --> 26:55.996
You've got one in your fingers, babe.

26:57.960 --> 27:01.873
Now, if you don't mind...I want
to get good and messy with my wee lady here.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.793
You're welcome to stay
ifyou'II not mind my habit.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.310
So... you're just gonna do nothing?

27:10.640 --> 27:12.596
Well, I wouldn't say that.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.598
Here, move.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.150
That's sleeping bag's not as damp as it looks.
You can sit there.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.198
All right. OK. I'm gonna pay you, all right?

27:26.280 --> 27:28.840
I'm gonna pay you
if you get me to the control room. OK?

27:28.920 --> 27:30.990
I've told you, we're not messing with him.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.599
How much?

27:39.120 --> 27:40.314
Fifty pounds?

27:41.280 --> 27:43.714
Well...

27:45.960 --> 27:47.916
You know...

27:48.760 --> 27:50.830
I guess rules are made to be broken, eh?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.114
Thank you.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.790
Babe.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.039
Mandy.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.756
Gonna go and help the wee lady here.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.474
- Who?
- I'm gonna help our friend Kate, here.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.516
I'm gonna take her to see the guard.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.231
Do you fancy her?

28:08.320 --> 28:10.038
No, I fancy you.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.919
- So. what are you. French?
- No. I'm German.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.357
German. I support Germany
when they're playing against England at football.

28:23.080 --> 28:26.436
Come to think of it, I support anyone
playing against England at football.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.988
- How much further to the guard?
- It's quite a way yet.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.798
This place is a rabbit warren.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.873
Do you know, there's 400 miles of track
down here? Plus loads more that ain't in use.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.518
Really?

28:38.440 --> 28:40.112
Aye, really.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.838
Jim?

29:22.920 --> 29:25.150
I think I might know
what happened to your friend.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.355
What?

29:26.440 --> 29:28.829
A while back...,
some homeless people went missing.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.195
- What do you mean "missing"?
- Disappearing.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.590
There were rumours that something was
creeping up on them and taking them.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.998
Are you joking?

29:40.200 --> 29:45.069
Course I'm fucking joking. Homeless people
don't go missing. Homeless people are missing.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.918
Jim?

29:58.120 --> 29:59.678
Jim?

30:10.400 --> 30:11.515
Shit.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.556
R.ay!

30:13.640 --> 30:15.631
Come here!

30:19.640 --> 30:20.993
Ray, come here.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.229
I've been trying to get me and Mandy in a hostel
cos the weather's getting cold.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.993
But the housing man,
he's not been round for months.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.834
But he cannae get in touch with me
on the phone cos I've not got a phone.

30:49.920 --> 30:53.595
We were gonna stay at my mate Tommy's,
but he got busted, he got done for dealing.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.911
OK, listen, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I really don't mean to be rude,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.470
but...I don't care about your lifetime story
right now, OK?

31:00.560 --> 31:03.438
We have to get to the security guard
as soon as possible.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.158
You're a cheeky fucking bitch.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.958
- Do you know that?
- Kate.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.432
Guy?

31:12.160 --> 31:13.878
Oh, my God, it's Guy.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.799
We're just gonna get help.
We'll be right back, OK?

31:23.080 --> 31:25.036
What are you looking at me for?

31:25.120 --> 31:26.553
I don't know.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.871
- Can't we just get him off the rails?
- He tried to rape you.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.710
- Let him rot.
- Please...help me.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.994
Fuck off.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.075
OK, listen...Iisten.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.191
Will another 50 do it, huh?

31:49.360 --> 31:51.351
You're lucky she's a soft touch, you know.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.989
If you tried to do that to my girl,
I'd cut your fucking balls off.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.635
- Fucking hell.
- What is it?

32:02.640 --> 32:04.710
All right, put your arms round my neck

32:10.200 --> 32:12.430
Fuck!

32:26.640 --> 32:28.596
Jimmy, is that your dog?

32:31.360 --> 32:32.839
Mandy.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.513
Jimmy?

32:35.600 --> 32:37.591
We should stay together!

32:39.640 --> 32:40.834
Oh...

32:41.760 --> 32:43.716
Guy.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.518
Who did this to you?

32:49.040 --> 32:51.190
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm sorry.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.072
Mandy!

33:04.600 --> 33:06.272
Mandy!

33:10.360 --> 33:12.191
Where is she?

33:22.240 --> 33:23.878
Mandy!

33:39.640 --> 33:41.392
Mandy!

33:44.680 --> 33:46.432
Fuck!

33:52.880 --> 33:54.472
Guy, listen.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.869
I'm gonna go and get Jimmy, OK?

33:56.960 --> 34:01.317
And I'm gonna go and get the security guard
and then we'll get out of here, OK?

34:01.400 --> 34:03.755
Just stay here. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.036
Just stay awake and you'll be fine.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.992
Kate...

34:12.760 --> 34:14.079
You'll be fine.

34:14.159 --> 34:15.478
You will.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.592
Come on.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.552
Hello?

34:47.639 --> 34:49.915
- Hello?
- Who is that?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.956
Hello. Are you the security guard?

34:52.040 --> 34:53.996
I'm the security supervisor.

34:54.080 --> 34:57.311
- Now. who are you?
- Um...well, I got locked in here and...

34:57.400 --> 35:02.713
Look, you have to help me. Somebody's
really badly hurt down here and...he's dying.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.472
Are you part of the homeless crowd?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.312
What? No, no.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.072
Well, yes, but no.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.515
- Well, which is it?
- What difference does it make?

35:10.600 --> 35:11.749
Call an ambulance!

35:11.840 --> 35:13.876
Where is this person? I don't see him.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.916
Where are you?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.514
Is that you? Well, he's down here.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.636
Well. you'II have to put him into view.

35:20.720 --> 35:24.679
Are you kidding me?
Just call an ambulance for God's sake.

35:24.760 --> 35:29.515
I'm not calling anyone until I've established
exactly what it is I'm dealing with here.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.990
For all I know there could be
a gang of crackheads down there with you.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.833
Do I look Iike a crackhead to you? Huh?

35:36.600 --> 35:40.639
It's hard to tell. I'm watching you
on a black-and-white monitor in a long shot.

35:40.720 --> 35:44.998
Listen. just call a fuck.ing ambulance.
The guy's bleeding to death.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.075
And as soon as you confirm that, I will.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.912
- Asshole.
- I heard that.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.956
Well, good.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.956
I'm going to get him, OK?

35:56.040 --> 35:59.032
OK, Guy. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to move you one more time.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.712
You'll be fine, OK?

36:00.800 --> 36:02.631
Guy? What are...

36:03.840 --> 36:05.512
Guy?

36:06.240 --> 36:07.912
Guy?

36:16.520 --> 36:18.476
OK, OK, OK

36:20.400 --> 36:22.960
Into shot...where the fucker can see you.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.234
Look. asshole! Is this enough?

36:27.040 --> 36:28.268
He's dead!

36:30.040 --> 36:31.996
Now get me out of here!

36:32.080 --> 36:33.991
OK... wait there.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.748
Get off!

36:41.840 --> 36:43.796
Go on, get out.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.313
Shoo! Get away.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.949
Oh, shit.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.638
Oh, fuck...

37:30.880 --> 37:32.029
Jimmy.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.556
Jimmy. Where's Mandy?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.392
Did he get Mandy?

37:50.480 --> 37:53.597
The security guard's killed and Guy's dead.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.636
We have to leave right now.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.352
Jimmy.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.076
No. No!

38:02.760 --> 38:04.910
Listen. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

38:05.960 --> 38:07.916
I'll make it very simple for you, OK

38:08.000 --> 38:13.870
If...if I go through the next tunnel to the
next station, is there going to be another guard?

38:14.920 --> 38:16.239
Huh?

38:16.320 --> 38:18.276
Answer me, please.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.196
Fuck you, I'll do it by myself.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.070
Are you finished?

38:28.440 --> 38:30.510
There's a torch over there.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.556
You'II need a pair of boots.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.474
Jimmy.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.710
Howfar is it to the nex station?

39:04.480 --> 39:05.993
Huh?

39:07.600 --> 39:09.556
Jimmy, how far is it?

39:10.800 --> 39:13.109
Don't know.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.836
What about the live track?

39:16.560 --> 39:20.678
You'll be all right
if you don't touch that one...that one...

39:22.040 --> 39:23.996
W-wait. Which one?

39:24.080 --> 39:25.798
Um...

39:25.880 --> 39:29.111
- Don't touch any of them.
- Ah. OK.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.438
Wait.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.958
Wait.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.676
I was gonna take her home.

39:58.760 --> 40:02.514
I was gonna take her backto Scotland
and get her off the gear.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.116
I was gonna let my mam look after her.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.679
But I didn't.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.556
What was that? Jimmy, what was that?

40:18.720 --> 40:19.948
A train.

40:20.040 --> 40:22.474
- Don't joke.
- Don't joke on railway lines.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.756
Come on then. Shit!

40:46.080 --> 40:47.877
It's stopping. It's stopping!

40:47.960 --> 40:49.951
- What if it's him?
- It'll just be a driver.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.349
- We don't know that, do we?
- What are you on about?

40:52.440 --> 40:55.000
They drive all night.
They stop if someone's on the line.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.470
Kate, are you not listening?
The driver's gonna get us out of here.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.314
I'm not listening cos you're not thinking straight.
You're fucked out of your head.

41:03.400 --> 41:06.597
We have to assume it's him.
Maybe you're right, but we have to assume.

41:06.680 --> 41:09.319
Look. there's a passageway back here. Let's go.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.878
Do you think whoever's driving the train
killed Mandy?

41:15.960 --> 41:18.918
I don't know,
but I really don't want to stay and find out.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.513
- I think... I do.
- No. come on.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.397
Seriously. Come on!

41:22.480 --> 41:24.471
You don't understand. I wanna meet him.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.472
Don't be stupid. Come with me.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.438
Look, if it's the driver, I'll call for you, all right?

41:33.160 --> 41:35.754
If it's not...I won't.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.750
No, I'm not leaving you here.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.115
It's exactly what you're gonna do.
Take Ray and go.

41:42.440 --> 41:43.156
Go!

41:44.880 --> 41:46.233
OK, OK

41:46.960 --> 41:48.393
Fine. OK.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.152
Here I am!

42:11.360 --> 42:13.316
Where are you, you fucker?

42:24.040 --> 42:25.758
Come on, you fuck!

42:30.520 --> 42:32.476
Come on!

42:32.560 --> 42:34.516
Fucking come on!

42:48.280 --> 42:50.271
Mate. Mate.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.918
Jimmy.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.194
Jimmy!

44:53.720 --> 44:55.358
Hello?

48:52.160 --> 48:53.957
Get that thing away from me.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.193
I ain't dead.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.990
I thought you was dead when he brought you in.

50:32.880 --> 50:35.075
Look...are you injured?

50:36.560 --> 50:38.516
No...I don't think so.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.272
Well, check yourself.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.836
I think I'm all right.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.716
What is this place?

50:55.600 --> 50:57.556
The sewage system.

51:10.160 --> 51:11.878
What's your name?

51:11.960 --> 51:13.678
George.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.277
George. R..eally?

51:17.760 --> 51:19.716
What's so funny?

51:19.800 --> 51:23.509
I...I was supposed to meet a George tonight.

51:25.200 --> 51:27.839
This is not quite what I had in mind.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.796
What was that?

51:55.560 --> 51:57.516
- Huh?
- Ignore it.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.751
What do you mean "ignore it"?
Has the girl been here? Huh?

52:00.840 --> 52:02.796
I don't know.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.639
- Oh. God!
- What? What?

52:10.720 --> 52:14.156
There's something in here.
Something just touched my leg.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.196
- What is it?
- Dunno.

52:18.160 --> 52:20.230
It's just some block...age from the pipe.

52:21.760 --> 52:23.716
How did it get in your cage?

52:23.800 --> 52:25.756
How should I know?

52:25.840 --> 52:28.035
Maybe it...floated underneath.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.949
So?

52:30.040 --> 52:33.157
Maybe the bars in between the cages
don't touch the floor.

52:33.880 --> 52:35.199
So?

52:35.280 --> 52:38.511
So maybe we can swim underneath...

52:39.840 --> 52:43.594
..pull ourselves out...and get out.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.634
You see, over there...there's an open cage.

52:49.040 --> 52:53.511
Swim through, haul yourself out,
then open mine.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.108
I can't.

52:57.160 --> 52:58.149
Why?

52:58.240 --> 53:00.754
- I can't swim.
- You don't need to swim.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.832
- Just pull yourself under, OK?
- I can't do that either.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.514
- Are you kidding?
- I can't hold my breath underwater.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.033
Listen...you better learn now

53:10.120 --> 53:14.193
cos if you don't, the only way
you're going to get out is if he pulls you out.

53:15.320 --> 53:19.233
Sorry. This ain't no time for swimming lessons,
all right, lady?

53:43.680 --> 53:45.636
Just one more cage. Go on.

54:58.160 --> 54:59.912
Come on, come on.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.871
Come on.

55:26.960 --> 55:28.916
Come on, come on.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.518
Here, take this.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.792
What is this place?

56:51.240 --> 56:53.037
Oh. no.

56:53.960 --> 56:55.916
That's Mandy.

56:56.640 --> 56:58.517
- You know her?
- Yeah.

57:00.680 --> 57:02.636
- Do you think she's alive?
- What?

57:02.720 --> 57:04.676
- Could you...
- No.

57:04.760 --> 57:06.955
Can you please check if she's breathing?

57:08.920 --> 57:11.309
- Look at her.
- Please. Please check.

57:25.560 --> 57:27.516
Are you OK?

57:41.440 --> 57:43.396
She's dead.

57:46.320 --> 57:49.278
Come on, come on, come on.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.956
- It's my fault!
- Listen, listen...

57:56.040 --> 58:00.511
- I paid Jimmy to come with me.
- We've got to think about getting out of here.

58:00.600 --> 58:03.478
He would have protected her.
She would not be dead.

58:03.560 --> 58:05.516
Listen, I've got a daughter.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.236
And I really wanna see her again.

58:13.280 --> 58:14.998
All right?

58:15.720 --> 58:18.234
Listen...we're gonna get out.

58:19.560 --> 58:21.232
OK?

58:21.320 --> 58:23.231
Yeah? Come on.

58:30.440 --> 58:32.396
Please.

58:59.880 --> 59:01.836
Hang on. Give me the torch.

59:11.240 --> 59:13.993

59:15.360 --> 59:17.669
The bricks are loose. Give me a hand.

59:17.760 --> 59:19.716
