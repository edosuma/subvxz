Don't touch my shit!

00:53.595 --> 00:55.305
I said, don't touch my shit!

00:55.388 --> 00:57.599

Miss Jones, mind your business.

01:06.816 --> 01:07.901
Thank you, Miss Jones.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.487
You wonder why you keep
getting thrown out of foster homes.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.864
- Whatever.
- Fucking with a man twice your age.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.283
I ain't touched your fat boyfriend.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.452
You grown, right? You a woman?

01:17.535 --> 01:18.703
Goddamn it, be one.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.456
Stop throwing my shit out the window.
I ain't playing with you.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.708
- Your ass 'bout to learn.
- Whatever.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.668
Don't want to hear you crying,

01:25.752 --> 01:28.338
Ain't nobody coming back nowhere!
Fuck your house!

01:30.215 --> 01:31.508
Slut ass.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.093
Dumb bitch.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.729
Social worker pressed me so hard
to rat on you.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.233
What you tell her?

02:30.316 --> 02:31.651
Ain't nothing to tell.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.445
You don't have to buy me stuff.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.616
But you're like... my step-daddy, right?

02:44.289 --> 02:46.207
Nadège done ruined half my shit.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.877
I could use some new stuff.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.678
Yeah, you should do it.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.980
I don't have no money to go out.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.524
Think it's cute
ringing everybody's bells this late?

03:53.608 --> 03:55.652
Yes, she's sorry.

03:55.735 --> 03:56.778
Fuck that bitch.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.738
I'd use the belt on that one, Lucila.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.407
You gotta teach these kids respect
if they gonna live here.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.369
Here one day
and you're already causing trouble.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.912
You wake the baby.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.239
Monique.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
Monique.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.036
Monique, you no sleep all day.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.956
I have to get to work.
Time to go to school!

04:50.039 --> 04:50.873
Come on.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.791
Ándale.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.210
Ay...

04:55.086 --> 04:56.421
Imposible.

05:19.861 --> 05:20.695
Omari.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.370
That's all you got? Come on.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.997
All right, let's go.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.540
Where you going?

05:35.918 --> 05:36.919
Omari.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.466
- You're like a little girl.
- Hold up.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.263
- What's up?
- Nadège kicked me out.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.351
- When?
- Yesterday.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.895
Help me get my stuff
before she steals something.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.522
Omari. You got something better to do?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.066
I'll be done at five.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.192
- Gotta go now.
- Hey.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.276
Five.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.028
- You here to wrestle?
- Please.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.863
All you ever practice is doubles.

06:03.946 --> 06:04.947
Shit's mad predictable.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.660
Your coach is wack, yo.
Your problem ain't even in the lift.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.872
You're not getting your shoulder in
close enough. You gotta go deep.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.798
Tell me how he rock that much bling
and not be locked up.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.509
- What'd Nadège throw you out for?
- She a crazy bitch.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.928
She's jealous 'cause Hassan
paid for my nails.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.514
Ain't my fault she ain't learned
how to please her man.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.934
- You got a new foster family yet?
- Whatever.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.186
Soon as my dad get out,
I'll stay with him.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.360
Wait, give me that.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.112
What are you doing?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.739
- Who that?
- Omari.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.033
Get out of here.
Mo don't live here no more.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.286
- I left my math book in her room.
- Is she with you?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.414
No.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.087
I... I need it to do my homework.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.300
- Hurry the hell up.
- The fuck out of the way!

07:06.384 --> 07:08.803
Oh, you fucking bitch!
Your punk ass through!

07:08.886 --> 07:09.846
Okay, Mo.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.223
- You wanna play?
- Mo, hurry up.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.561
What the fuck?

07:16.644 --> 07:17.603
Uh-huh.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.689
Trespassing.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.065
Tilden...

07:21.149 --> 07:23.317
- Who you calling?
- The police, that's who.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.153
Why you wanna do that?

07:25.236 --> 07:27.488
This slut done broke
in my house, Hassan.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.326
Hang up that phone before I smack you.

07:47.758 --> 07:48.593
Yo.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.053
Mad people be trying for the Powerball.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.473
Don't they know black people
don't never win real money?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.684
Shit, if I won...

07:58.186 --> 08:01.689
I'd buy me one of them big-ass TVs.
Surround sound and all that shit.

08:01.772 --> 08:02.940
Imagine Halo on that.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.192
- A TV?
- Yeah.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.653
I get that much money, I'm getting
a house and getting the fuck out.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.573
Where you gonna go?
Everyone you know is here.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.826
That much money, you can get a house,
move to Miami and be on the beach.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.787
- Eating oranges all day and shit.
- Oh, yeah, oranges.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.582
You'll be a millionaire
and you gonna be peeling oranges.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.793
- Please, you gonna be peeling for me.
- Yeah, all right.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.045
Yo.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.630
Can I get a lick?

08:26.464 --> 08:27.798
I don't know. Can I?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.800
How about you give me your number?

08:32.636 --> 08:34.804
1800-fine-ass-ho. What's up?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.268
Yo, Omari, where you going?

08:40.102 --> 08:42.647
Don't make me go back
to that Spanish lady house.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.316
Chill with me. Omari!

08:47.276 --> 08:50.363
- Gotta be up early for a run.
- You said we chilling at your place.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.532
- You owe me a rematch.
- Watch where you going!

08:59.080 --> 09:00.081
Shit.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.676
Fine, one rematch, but I'm not...

09:13.469 --> 09:15.846
- What up, O?
- What's up, Darrel?

09:16.931 --> 09:18.641
You the big man now, huh?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.102
How's your mom?

09:21.185 --> 09:22.270
She good.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.146
Yeah? She still dancing?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.691
Yeah.
She don't tell us where, though.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.443
It's better that way.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.574
I'm gonna go.
I got practice in the morning.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.575
Yeah? What for?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.411
Wrestling, actually.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.664
- No shit. What you weigh, 130?
- Yeah.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.084
But I'ma drop to 120.
I'ma dominate at 120.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.421
- Best correct your footwork.
- Whatever.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.465
How you gonna say whatever
when you be tripping on your feet?

09:51.549 --> 09:54.010
Think 'cause your mom buy you
new sneakers, you gonna make varsity?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.636
Take out all of the glass?

09:56.470 --> 09:58.097
- Yeah.
- Good.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.349
You no want if we get fined.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.106
You got a job? You work here?

10:07.189 --> 10:10.234
Better get your asses home.
Ya'll looking for trouble out this late.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.111
- Let me get your number.
- Ain't got one yet.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.404
Let me give you mine.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.591
All right, I'll see you.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.638
When he get out?

10:41.223 --> 10:42.725
Mind your damn business.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.020
- What'd I say?
- "I'm gonna dominate at 120."

10:46.103 --> 10:48.522
You wouldn't even be on a team
if it wasn't for me.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.941
Why you mad for?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.569
You supposed to be happy your pops is out.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.364
Mo?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.249
You don't see me working?

11:48.332 --> 11:50.251
- Why didn't you come find me?
- I been busy.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.669
Can I come live with you?

11:52.753 --> 11:53.963
You lost your mind?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.090
I can get a job.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.591
- No.
- I can help pay for the rent.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.176
No. I said no!

12:02.805 --> 12:03.806
Shit.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.729
What you need me for anyway?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.065
Look at you. You a grown woman now.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.903
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
We see each other round the way.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.747
I talked to him. He got a job now.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.082
- Like, a real job.
- Have a seat.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.834
You can find out where he live, right?

13:15.669 --> 13:18.672
First we need to discuss
what happened at Nadège's.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.343
- I had to get the rest of my shit.
- We had an agreement, Mo.

13:22.426 --> 13:26.222
You'd let me know if anything was missing,
and I'd send someone.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.556
I don't trust that bitch.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.352
And as your social worker,
if I can't trust you, I can't help you.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.063
Not gonna need your help
when I move in with my dad.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.731
We talked about this, Mo.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.153
He's not your legal guardian anymore.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.322
Well...

13:44.240 --> 13:46.367
he said he wanted to adopt me, so...

13:50.162 --> 13:53.707
I know the last few homes
have been difficult.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.169
But I do think Lucila...

13:57.920 --> 13:59.296
could be a really good family...

13:59.380 --> 14:01.674
No, she's not my fucking family!

14:05.761 --> 14:07.596
You lucky you skipped algebra.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.475
Ms. Nestor gave us a quiz,
and I swear that shit wasn't even math.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.145
What, you not talking to me now?
What'd I do?

14:16.063 --> 14:16.897
Watch it.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.031
- Say that shit to my face!
- Mo.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.324
Watch out!

14:27.408 --> 14:28.242
Mo, chill!

14:28.325 --> 14:31.620
Get off of me!
Bitch, if you don't get off of me...

14:31.704 --> 14:32.997
- Mo!
- Fuck you!

14:34.123 --> 14:36.083
- Calm down.
- She started it!

14:36.166 --> 14:37.751
Get the fuck off me!

14:37.835 --> 14:39.920
This is the third fight this month.

14:40.254 --> 14:43.257
As I've explained to Monique,
she'll be suspended for three days.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.010
She needs a positive outlet
to channel that anger.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.012
I'd love to see her
reach her potential.

14:48.095 --> 14:52.391
She's been given many opportunities,
but I cannot allow this kind of behavior.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.979
What's going on?  What's going on...

15:39.939 --> 15:42.524
with the door and the trash?

15:42.608 --> 15:44.026
We gotta go. Come on.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.444
Here we go.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.262
Give me that.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.932
Remember when your pops used to make us
wrestle for stupid shit, like...

17:39.725 --> 17:41.310
Happy Meal toys?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.813
You cried like a baby over that tow truck.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.899
Hey, Mater was the shit.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.904
Besides, you only won 'cause you cheated.

18:01.705 --> 18:02.664
Hurry up.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.251
You gonna be late.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.464
- I told you about coming round here.
- Please. Like you own this block.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.467
I'm coming from wrestling practice,
if you so nosey.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.096
Coach say I'm gonna be
his best lightweight.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.725
They got a girls' wrestling team?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.310
Nah, I'ma wrestle boys.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.816
Never heard of no girls wrestling
on no boys' team.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.485
Yeah, well... I'm better than you.

19:14.611 --> 19:15.445
That right?

19:16.029 --> 19:17.364
Come see for yourself.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.164
Cut them nails before you hit the mat.

19:41.805 --> 19:42.806
'Sup, troublemaker?

19:52.482 --> 19:54.067
Still letting people on the team?

19:54.776 --> 19:56.278
Practice starts at three.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.448
Gives you exactly four minutes
to stop wasting my time.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.534
- You ain't hear me?
- Coach, you need anything?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.953
I said, you still letting people
on the team?

20:05.037 --> 20:05.871
It's a boys' team.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.539
Could've fooled me.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.541
Besides, I need a positive outlet
for my anger.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.751
Right, Coach?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.920
No one here's interested in your games.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.880
- You see me talking to you?
- Hey.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.715
You wanna try out?

20:17.466 --> 20:20.302
- Coach, you ain't serious.
- Take a knee. Now.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.930
- You seen what she did to my girl?
- A knee.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.686
How many of you
missed this morning's run?

20:31.813 --> 20:33.899
Fifty push-ups, now.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.445
- One.
- Damn! They all get punished?

20:38.528 --> 20:39.613
What you waiting on?

20:39.696 --> 20:42.157
...three, four...

20:42.658 --> 20:45.369
- You like your earlobes?
- ...five, six...

20:47.079 --> 20:49.831
Don't even think about
getting on my mat in those things.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.627
...nine, ten...

20:53.710 --> 20:54.711
What are you doing?

20:54.795 --> 20:57.089
- What it look like?
- Pick it up. Pick it up.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.267
Do those rolls. Come on, Monique.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.356
Step deep, stay low.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.445
Keep your center low. Elbows in.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.212
One knee, keep the head up.
Quick transfer to the double.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.172
Keep your head up.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.842
Drive through with the ear
and your left leg.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.052
All right.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.972
Good, good, good. Okay, partner up.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.015
One, two.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.565
Omari.

21:57.774 --> 21:58.775
Practice with me.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.403
- Me and Jorge usually partner.
- So?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.155
Let him practice with somebody else.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.741
Switch.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.284
It don't look right.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.536
Get your head out fast. Come on.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.372
How you gonna say that when I been
showing you shit for years?

22:12.956 --> 22:14.791
Your pops' the one who been showing us.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.335
- He only showing me now.
- What?

22:16.835 --> 22:19.129
- Who you think training me?
- Get your girl in line.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.839
Go eat some more tacos, fat-ass.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.382
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.177
Anyone planning to stay on this team
better be drilling now.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.646
Tyson.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.066
Pair up with Mo.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.109
- Yeah, Ty!
- Tyson.

22:44.446 --> 22:48.742
What? You ain't never touched a girl?
Today's your lucky day.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.374
Hey! Opa!

22:55.957 --> 22:57.459
My bad. Come on, let's wrestle.

23:00.796 --> 23:01.630
Ah!

23:03.048 --> 23:06.885
Damn! Now you a perv,
trying to feel some titty?

23:06.968 --> 23:07.844
Tyson.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.347
Switch with me.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.307
Fucking pussy, yo.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.043
Yo.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.128
Oh, shit.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.298
Other man, switch. Malik.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.883
Stick to the drill.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.609
Ain't nothing in it for a dude.

24:05.152 --> 24:08.363
You beat a girl, you look like
a motherfucking roughneck,

24:08.447 --> 24:10.949
don't know how to treat a female.
Get beat, you a straight bitch.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.911
So how's that my fault?

24:20.083 --> 24:23.170
Remember that one time
I took you to get your hair braided?

24:23.253 --> 24:26.381
You were small,
you were walking around all proud,

24:26.465 --> 24:27.966
like you some type of queen.

24:28.049 --> 24:31.636
The girl across the hall
from your grandma called you ugly.

24:32.345 --> 24:35.140
Gave her a bloody nose, too.
Ain't never talk to me like that again.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.395
When I came home and told you,
you slapped me upside the head.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.313
Remember why?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.316
'Cause I ain't raise you...

24:45.859 --> 24:47.777
to give a shit what nobody else think.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.018
Got our first match in two weeks.

25:22.145 --> 25:24.231
Don't know how any of you
expect to make weight

25:24.314 --> 25:26.525
if you can't even get your asses up
for morning run.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.653
I'll be watching to see
who's ready for varsity.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.846
Monique. Monique.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.851
What?

26:02.018 --> 26:04.604
Think you cute dressing your baby
all bougie for church?

26:05.355 --> 26:06.773
Have you seen my pearls?

26:08.608 --> 26:09.901
English, lady.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.070
I'll pray for you.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.094
Ten more seconds. Finish strong.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.930
- Let's go, champ.
- Come on, wrestle hard.

26:39.639 --> 26:42.183
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Come on, yo.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.893
Ooh.

26:44.894 --> 26:47.439
- Chad, nine. Chris, four.
- Yeah!

26:49.983 --> 26:50.984
All right, next up.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.028
- Next up.
- Come on, O.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.948
Go ahead, O.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.950
- Let's get it, kid.
- That's enough.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.201
That's enough. Omari.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.454
You wresting off of 120,
or you busy wetting your pants?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.791
Put her in her place, man.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.543
Drop her ass.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.594
- There it go.
- Yeah.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.970
- Let's get that.
- There you go.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.305
Duck under, man.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.390
Don't tie up. Wrestle hard. Let's go, O.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.017
Enough dancing,
somebody take a shot.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.103
- See what I mean?
- Oh, damn!

27:27.187 --> 27:29.022
- Sweep.
- Let's go, O. Get up.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.066
Come on, O. Get out of that shit.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.108
Here we go.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.779
Come on, bro. She mad scrawny.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.284
I would end this shit in 30 seconds.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.661
Get her down, O.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.955
No, no, no.

27:46.539 --> 27:48.041
Ooh!

27:48.625 --> 27:50.168
Damn. You gonna let a girl dominate?

27:50.251 --> 27:52.087
Get up, O. Get up.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.923
Oh! Shit.

27:56.049 --> 27:56.883
Damn, O.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.677
We got ourselves a new starter.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.557
Get that signed before Saturday's match.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.726
Thought we was gonna
have to call the ambulance.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.061
Yeah, okay, okay.

28:09.562 --> 28:12.190
You couldn't beat a girl.
What are you doing?

28:12.273 --> 28:14.984
You so shook, you ain't even give me
a chance to take you

28:15.068 --> 28:17.612
- and your big titties down.
- Oh!

28:17.696 --> 28:20.198
Yo, you like it rough, huh?

28:20.281 --> 28:22.492
- I'm down with that.
- Nigga, please.

28:22.575 --> 28:25.286
Y'all too busy jerking each other off
at McDonald's to make morning run?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.288
- Oh, shit.
- She's right.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.040
All ya'll fucking lazy.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.210
Yo, Mo, is it true your dad trains you?

28:33.503 --> 28:35.171
Yeah. So?

28:35.255 --> 28:37.090
Omari said he won states.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.217
He gonna come to the match?

28:40.176 --> 28:41.428
He'll be there.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.724
By a hundred-pound girl.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.101
She was on your ass.

28:48.184 --> 28:49.686
I let her win. You heard her.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.187
She said, "My dad trained me."

29:21.718 --> 29:23.678
You ain't gonna tell me
you were getting out?

29:23.762 --> 29:25.597
I gotta find out in the streets.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.307
Still need to lay low.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.810
Yo, what up, shorty?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.147
You remember Monique?

29:34.230 --> 29:36.065
Yeah, I seen her round the way.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.359
Growing up real nice,
just like her mommy.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.112
What you need?

29:41.863 --> 29:44.824
Nothing. Just came to let you know
I made varsity.

29:44.908 --> 29:45.825
No shit?

29:46.534 --> 29:48.787
What type of team you make, baby girl?

29:48.912 --> 29:51.039
They got girls wrestling now.
You believe that shit?

29:51.122 --> 29:53.291
Yeah, I can believe that.

29:53.374 --> 29:56.336
I seen some bitches get nastier
than my pits.

29:56.419 --> 29:59.088
She got her pops' fighting genes,
I guess.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.886
We got our first match on Saturday.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.721
I'd like to see that.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.768
All right, that it?

30:12.519 --> 30:14.270
Starts at four. Hedgeman.

30:22.904 --> 30:23.738
All right, then.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.911
- So she's staying by you again?
- Nah.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.873
You know I got a living situation
set up for you.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.836
- Gotta think about it.
- What you mean, think about it?

30:37.919 --> 30:40.213
I'm trying to give you a better situation.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.923
You gotta think about that?

30:51.140 --> 30:52.851
You don't answer her calls.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.354
- You come home beat up.
- The fuck's she talking about?

30:56.437 --> 30:58.022
Look. Covered in bruises.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.107
Ain't like she think.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.942
She's also missing some jewelry.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.862
I told her I ain't steal
her ugly-ass earrings.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.907
There's a group home in the Bronx
that has a spot open.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.159
The Bronx? You know how far that is
from my school?

31:10.243 --> 31:12.704
- There's a school near the home.
- No, look.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.415
That wrestling coach she met,
he gonna teach me, like...

31:15.999 --> 31:17.333
discipline and all that.

31:18.751 --> 31:19.586
See?

31:22.839 --> 31:24.090
- Wrestling?
- Yeah.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.885
What's she saying? What's wrestling?

31:27.802 --> 31:28.720
Uh...

31:29.470 --> 31:34.893
I think... she joined
the wrestling team at her school.

31:34.976 --> 31:35.935
Wrestling?

31:36.477 --> 31:37.854
Like with costumes?

31:37.937 --> 31:40.690
No, like in high school. The sport.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.318
But that's not for girls.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.571
Ask him, he gonna keep me
out of trouble. I swear.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.119
Easy.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.829
On the inside.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.541
Foot on the inside, man!

31:59.125 --> 32:00.001
Let's go.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.338
Jamal, get your legs back.

32:13.848 --> 32:14.682
What?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.643
Let's go.

32:19.687 --> 32:22.357
You know you gotta go beast
on their asses, right?

32:23.483 --> 32:25.526
Come on, ref, make 'em wrestle.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.955
Get to your base.
Get to your base.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.500
They fit all right?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.632
Yeah. Thanks.

32:52.887 --> 32:53.846
Gotta loosen up.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.559
You'll be all right.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.271
Plus, the kid you're wrestling,
he's a freshman.

33:02.855 --> 33:05.274
Besides, he ain't seen your magic weapon.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.527
Mo. You're up.

33:13.574 --> 33:16.619
Remember, keep him in front of you,
and don't tie up.

33:16.703 --> 33:17.787
Look for the shot.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.791
Hey, hey, where's your head at?

33:22.375 --> 33:23.501
All right? Okay.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.388
Seriously?

33:35.471 --> 33:37.640
- How's this even allowed?
- How are you even allowed?

33:37.724 --> 33:39.642
- 'Cause I'm a dude.
- Why you crying like a bitch?

33:39.726 --> 33:40.768
Mo, cool it!

33:40.852 --> 33:43.688
Knock that off.
You're here to wrestle.

33:46.024 --> 33:46.858
In the middle.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.404
Shake hands.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.907
Let's go. Shake hands.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.873
Let's go, Mo! Let's go!

34:02.457 --> 34:03.374
Stop him.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.084
Keep him in front of you.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.295
Make it quick, Santo.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.212
Don't tie up!

34:09.338 --> 34:10.840
Work the score.

34:10.922 --> 34:12.717
Take a shot. Take a shot.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.137
- Two.
- That's it!

34:16.219 --> 34:17.513
That's it! That's it!

34:21.016 --> 34:24.812
Santo! Santo! Santo!

34:24.896 --> 34:26.481
Off your back! Off your back!

34:27.065 --> 34:27.899
Two.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.025
Come on.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.650
- Three.
- Bridge!

34:31.069 --> 34:32.070
Four.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.949
Okay, it's Red's choice.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.369
Red chose top. Green, set up.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.498
Red, get set.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.708
Up and out, Mo. Up and out.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.170
Easy.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.339
Come on, Mo.

34:52.255 --> 34:53.674
Watch the fingers.

34:54.675 --> 34:55.551
Come on, Mo.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.929
Let's go, Mo! Let's go, Mo!

34:58.763 --> 35:00.348
- Come on, Mo!
- One, green.

35:01.099 --> 35:01.974
One.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.143
Two.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.312
Three.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.315
- Get off your back!
- Four.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.526
- Get up! Off your back.
- Five.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.196
- Get to your base.
- That's three near falls.

35:15.738 --> 35:16.572
Red.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.450
Come on, Mo! Break the hand.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.036
One escape. Green.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.082
Good! Good!

35:26.165 --> 35:28.459
Two! Takedown, green. One.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.460
Keep him down.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.711
Two.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.713
- Three.
- Lift the head.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.715
- Four.
- Lift the head.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.592
Five.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.678
That's it! That's it! Right there!

35:42.849 --> 35:43.933
Winner is green.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.107
Let me get a shrimp-fried rice.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.194
What size you want?

35:55.278 --> 35:57.613
Let me get a... small.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.366
Gotta watch that weight, right?

36:06.622 --> 36:09.333
Tell you what,
you don't appreciate your own room

36:09.417 --> 36:11.544
until you share a cell with a mental case.

36:12.378 --> 36:15.089
This one foster home,
I had to share a room with six kids.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.009
- Place smelled like shit.
- Yeah, well...

36:19.886 --> 36:22.221
Juan know he owe me, so...

36:23.347 --> 36:24.807
You working for him again?

36:27.310 --> 36:28.895
You stupid? Nah.

36:29.937 --> 36:30.938
Working for him?

36:31.355 --> 36:33.441
This is just like payback.

36:33.524 --> 36:35.193
Know what I mean? Back pay.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.196
I'm gonna save up a little bit...

36:38.905 --> 36:39.739
then I'm out.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.619
- Where you going?
- North Carolina.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.455
- Aunt Keisha's?
- You remember her?

36:47.538 --> 36:49.290
She still got that crazy dog?

36:49.415 --> 36:52.168
- Russell? Russell wasn't crazy.
- That dog was definitely crazy.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.712
He tried to bite my arm.
I still got the marks.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.340
'Cause you and your cousins
used to try to ride his ass.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.635
Remember that one time
we pinned his ears back?

37:01.510 --> 37:03.512
And you wonder why he bit you. Shit.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.057
Even a dog got some pride.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.733
We should've never came back here.

37:19.445 --> 37:22.281
Shit don't always work out
the way it's supposed to.

37:31.707 --> 37:34.126
My boy Jay get out,
we gonna open this car wash...

37:34.335 --> 37:35.461
down in Greensboro.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.338
- For real?
- Yeah.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.050
Jay know the owner.

37:44.512 --> 37:47.598
Car wash been sitting empty
at the dude's gas station.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.767
We gonna go 50-50
on the whole thing.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.852
We ain't gonna be nobody's bitch.

37:54.021 --> 37:55.064
I don't really…

37:55.940 --> 37:58.442
I don't really see it.
Where's my counter gonna be at again?

38:04.907 --> 38:08.119
Come on, man.
You know I know how to upsell.

38:08.202 --> 38:10.079
Watch me double your take.

38:34.687 --> 38:37.189
Mini Mo! Mini Mo!

38:38.107 --> 38:40.651
When's the last time
Hedgeman made playoffs?

38:40.735 --> 38:43.112
- Never.
- How'd you like to change that?

38:43.195 --> 38:44.822
- Yeah!
- Come on, now!

38:44.905 --> 38:47.950
Chop, highlight!  Chop, highlight!
Highlight!

38:49.702 --> 38:51.287
There we go!

38:59.837 --> 39:03.049
You see his face
when I hit the reverse? I'm like a snake.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.426
Just when you think you got me...

39:05.509 --> 39:07.970
- Watch me go all the way to cities.
- First time I went to cities,

39:08.054 --> 39:09.513
I had a clean record.

39:09.889 --> 39:10.890
Not one loss.

39:11.140 --> 39:11.974
Damn.

39:12.558 --> 39:14.810
Go in there head all big. Get on the mat.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.439
Dude half my size come at me
frothing at the mouth

39:18.522 --> 39:20.024
like he got rabies.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.320
I'm like,
"Who the hell is this little bulldog?"

39:25.363 --> 39:26.781
Man, that kid had bite.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.241
- He beat you?
- You stupid?

39:30.242 --> 39:31.077
Nah.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.205
They match the best with
the worst records in the first round.

39:34.288 --> 39:36.582
This kid come in knowing he got one shot.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.711
It's sink or swim, and this motherfucker
did not want to drown.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.216
Sometimes wanting it that bad is enough.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.344
Unfortunately, not when you messing
with the king.

39:50.137 --> 39:53.265
As soon as she's mobile,
you'll wanna get those cabinet locks.

39:53.349 --> 39:56.352
- Especially in the kitchen.
- Yes, yes. I make good.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.813
I don't wanna
promise anything, but...

39:58.896 --> 40:02.274
I think there's a very good chance
you'll be able to adopt her.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.613
There is Monique.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.240
The one in the other room.

40:09.532 --> 40:13.035
Hi, Monique.
I'm June, Nyasa's social worker.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.538
I understand you moved in
not too long ago.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.373
How do you like living here?

40:20.501 --> 40:21.836
I ain't gonna be here long.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.422
She can have my room soon enough.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.400
Yo, listen, listen, listen!

42:05.606 --> 42:06.857
You coming in or not?

42:18.661 --> 42:20.579
Thought you said you was done with Juan.

42:22.498 --> 42:25.417
You want me cleaning up rat shit
and picking up trash?

42:28.629 --> 42:31.173
Ain't no punk-ass boss stealing from me.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.352
So my girl going to playoffs.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.443
Go in there and get my smokes.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.292
I don't see none in here.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.882
You practicing that bear hug?

43:14.925 --> 43:15.759
Yeah.

43:19.096 --> 43:20.598
So, what you waiting for?

43:33.110 --> 43:34.361
What?

43:35.571 --> 43:36.447
Nothing.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.037
Go ahead, set up.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.134
Uh-uh. Nah, nah, nah, look.

43:57.217 --> 43:58.302
You can't do nothing.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.387
Pin this arm. Let me see.

44:02.056 --> 44:02.890
Grab me.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.143
Pop the arm.

44:07.269 --> 44:09.313
Gonna pin his down...

44:10.064 --> 44:11.148
and drive through.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.067
You feel me?

44:21.575 --> 44:22.409
Go ahead.

44:24.036 --> 44:24.870
Sit down.

44:53.732 --> 44:56.110
They better have wrestling teams
in Greensboro.

45:01.573 --> 45:02.574
Let's try again.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.371
Come on.

45:08.330 --> 45:09.456
In a minute.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.219
We gotta paint that car wash
something fresh.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.850
Think people getting their car washed
somewhere 'cause of a color?

45:28.517 --> 45:29.435
Hell, yeah.

45:29.518 --> 45:32.563
Think people getting their car washed
in some boring joint?

45:32.646 --> 45:34.606
You gotta get niggas
with the fly-ass rims,

45:34.690 --> 45:37.025
dope-ass set of seats. Detailing?

45:37.109 --> 45:38.652
That's where the money at, yo.

45:41.989 --> 45:42.906
All right.

45:45.451 --> 45:48.036
All right, what color you think
get the most business?

45:48.120 --> 45:49.705
That's easy. Gold.

45:52.374 --> 45:55.169
- What?
- Where the fuck you get this from?

45:57.254 --> 45:58.797
It's called vision, man.

45:59.798 --> 46:01.550
- Ain't my fault you ain't got none.
- Watch out.

46:01.633 --> 46:03.302
Oh, now you the one with the ideas?

46:03.927 --> 46:04.762
Hey!

46:09.516 --> 46:10.350
I got the arm.

46:10.934 --> 46:12.227
I got the arm.

46:12.311 --> 46:14.438
- I got the head. Just giving me every...
- Oh!

46:15.606 --> 46:16.607
Mo, on his back.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.951
Let's go.

46:29.203 --> 46:30.829
- Cover.
- Come on, Mo.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.623
Take him down, Mo.

46:33.624 --> 46:37.252
Mini Mo! Mini Mo! Mini Mo!

46:41.048 --> 46:42.508
Yo, you heard?

46:42.591 --> 46:45.177
Jorge's brother's bringing his dirt bike
after Coach's thing.

46:45.260 --> 46:47.012
- Word?
- He gonna let me ride.

46:47.095 --> 46:48.764
I'm gonna pop a wheelie and everything.

46:49.890 --> 46:50.724
What?

46:50.808 --> 46:53.894
It's easy. I seen it on YouTube.
Just let go of the clutch and pop.

46:54.686 --> 46:55.813
Yeah, all right.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.899
- You down?
- No, I got plans.

47:00.025 --> 47:01.610
Juan got you walking his dogs again?

47:02.361 --> 47:03.195
Hell, no.

47:03.278 --> 47:06.740
"You better bring their asses back clean.
Don't want no shit on my Persians."

47:06.824 --> 47:07.825
Yo, shut up.

47:07.908 --> 47:11.745
I heard he brushes his dogs' teeth
with an electronic toothbrush.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.584
- Yo, you ready?
- Give me a sec.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.253
What you sulking for, string bean?

47:19.837 --> 47:22.464
Keep on drinking them protein shakes,
you'll get your glory soon enough.

47:22.548 --> 47:23.715
It's Darrel, right?

47:24.716 --> 47:26.593
I hear she takes after you.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.222
It's in the blood, I guess.

47:30.305 --> 47:33.267
Well, you're a stronger man than me.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.353
If my daughter wanted to wrestle,
I'd...

47:39.773 --> 47:40.774
Where'd you wrestle at?

47:41.441 --> 47:42.359
Five-six-nine.

47:42.985 --> 47:46.196
I was at collegiate.
Probably before your time.

47:47.322 --> 47:49.074
- Oh, yeah, probably.
- All right.

47:49.658 --> 47:51.243
We gotta bounce.

47:51.326 --> 47:54.454
I'm taking the team out for a bite
if you'd like to join us.

47:54.538 --> 47:58.125
Unless, uh...
there's somewhere else you gotta be.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.669
- Yeah, at work.
- I thought we was hanging out?

48:01.795 --> 48:03.046
Maybe later.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.133
- But you said we was...
- Plans change... Mo.

48:08.051 --> 48:11.013
Besides, team gotta bond and all that.
Ain't that right, Coach?

48:12.556 --> 48:13.390
Yeah.

48:13.974 --> 48:14.808
You got it.

48:18.145 --> 48:19.271
Call me later.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.778
You gotta slow down.
You gonna crash.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.656
- I got this.
- You gonna crash.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.575
- Oh!
- I told you.

48:31.658 --> 48:33.368
- Game cheated, yo.
- I told you.

48:33.452 --> 48:37.039
The problem is your driving's worse
than your wrestling. That's what's...

48:37.122 --> 48:38.874
That's the real deal.

48:39.291 --> 48:41.168
- Now what?
- You all in my ear.

48:41.251 --> 48:44.421
- Get your stink breath out my face.
- Then do something.

48:44.504 --> 48:46.882
We about to do a pull-up contest.
You coming?

48:46.965 --> 48:49.509
Yo. I thought you was
gonna pop a wheelie.

48:49.593 --> 48:50.677
Yeah, what happened?

48:50.761 --> 48:51.887
We came for the show.

48:51.970 --> 48:54.681
I told you my brother had a race.
I said that.

48:54.765 --> 48:55.849
Whatever. Mo, you coming?

48:56.266 --> 48:58.644
- No, I'ma chill here.
- Whatever.

48:58.727 --> 48:59.770
Ooh!

49:02.356 --> 49:04.274
For real, though, we make it to finals...

49:04.942 --> 49:07.319
it's like a whole bunch of recruiters
that come.

49:07.402 --> 49:08.487
Mm-hm.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.030
- Bet you get a scholarship.
- Yeah!

49:10.113 --> 49:14.326
Our little prince right here
is gonna get a free ride to college.

49:14.409 --> 49:16.954
Whatever, man. Whatever, man.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.039
You gonna be coming by my place
every weekend

49:19.122 --> 49:20.791
trying to holla at some college hos.

49:20.874 --> 49:23.585
I will be prying them off my dick, bro.
'Sup, shorty?

49:23.669 --> 49:25.170
You want a ride? Look... Oh.

49:26.546 --> 49:28.423
My bad, he ain't take his meds.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.050
Why you trying to fuck up my game for?

49:30.133 --> 49:31.885
What game? What game?

49:32.678 --> 49:33.637
Exactly.

49:33.720 --> 49:37.641
Anyway... there's mad women's teams
in college now.

49:38.308 --> 49:40.018
You know?

49:42.604 --> 49:43.855
What's up, beautiful?

49:44.606 --> 49:46.108
No, no, we just chilling.

49:56.785 --> 49:57.619

49:59.037 --> 50:00.038
Nah, this the real shit.

50:21.184 --> 50:26.148
All right, y'all. Tonight, we got
three-time Brownsville champ...

50:26.231 --> 50:27.691
It's the real fight right here.

50:27.774 --> 50:29.985
...Keisha the Killer.
Make some noise for Keisha!

50:32.738 --> 50:34.531
But don't be fooled,

50:34.614 --> 50:37.200
'cause Miss Lala, she may look skinny,

50:37.284 --> 50:40.120
but she ain't come all the way
from Flatbush to eat shit.

50:40.203 --> 50:41.621
Give it up for Miss Lala.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.206
- Where's the money at?
- They boxers?

50:43.290 --> 50:46.043
- Show your bets.
- Nah, kid, they fiercer than that.

50:46.126 --> 50:48.295
All right, ladies,
center of the ring.

50:48.378 --> 50:52.883
No biting, no scratching, no hair pulling,
no weapons. Got it?

51:04.061 --> 51:06.229
Hey, hey! No hair pulling.
No hair pulling.

51:36.885 --> 51:39.513
Ya'll give it up for Keisha the Killer!

52:08.083 --> 52:09.042
Go ahead, eat.

52:10.418 --> 52:13.088
That's cool, I can't eat.
We got another match on Saturday.

52:13.171 --> 52:14.965
Malik said there might be
college recruiters.

52:15.048 --> 52:17.717
Oh! Well, if Malik say...

52:17.801 --> 52:19.094
Stop playing.

52:19.761 --> 52:21.471
They got women's teams now.

52:21.763 --> 52:22.764
College cool...

52:23.598 --> 52:26.560
and all that, until you get hit
with real responsibilities.

52:32.023 --> 52:33.275
When your mom passed…

52:35.944 --> 52:38.405
I did what I had to do.
I didn't have no choice.

52:41.449 --> 52:44.452
Can't wait till I make my own money,
get my own place.

52:44.536 --> 52:48.540
Well, if I could, I'd be in the ring
like them girls tonight.

52:49.374 --> 52:51.918
Them girls on some other shit.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.879
I think that one girl got her jaw broke.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.505
But you know how much money they make?

52:56.381 --> 52:57.215
Shit.

52:57.632 --> 52:59.134
You said the money was good with Juan.

52:59.217 --> 53:02.345
You said you was saving up
for the car wash.

53:05.098 --> 53:06.892
Yeah, well, Jay didn't make parole.

53:07.434 --> 53:09.853
So, unless I can come up with his half...

53:10.604 --> 53:12.856
and quick, ain't gonna be no car wash.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.281
Fuck, Monique!

53:21.364 --> 53:24.993
Shit. The minute I get out,
you in my grill to take care of you.

53:25.076 --> 53:28.079
- I told you it ain't like that.
- Did you make varsity or not?

53:28.872 --> 53:30.832
- Yeah.
- Ain't none of them girls

53:30.916 --> 53:32.751
training on no boys' wrestling team.

53:32.834 --> 53:34.377
You already had an advantage.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.630
You working out with dudes,
and you training with me.

53:36.713 --> 53:39.841
One fight, you can make as much
as I make in a week working the lot.

53:51.728 --> 53:52.687
Fact is...

53:53.897 --> 53:55.357
if I don't come up with ten Gs

53:55.440 --> 53:59.069
in the next two weeks, owner gonna sell
the wash to somebody else. I'm...

54:00.570 --> 54:01.655
I'm doing my part.

54:03.281 --> 54:05.742
We both know what happen
if I keep working for Juan.

54:15.710 --> 54:16.544
Fuck it!

54:19.422 --> 54:20.799
Fuck it. Fuck it.

54:21.549 --> 54:23.885
Fuck it. It's stupid. I'm stupid.

54:23.969 --> 54:24.970
I'm stupid.

54:25.053 --> 54:27.889
- I ain't say...
- I shouldn't have took your ass there.

54:31.226 --> 54:34.104
- I'm saying the money...
- Eat if you gonna eat. Shit. I gotta...

54:34.396 --> 54:36.106
I gotta get back to the lot.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.509
Damn! No wonder you ain't make varsity.

55:04.592 --> 55:06.803
You wouldn't be starting
if I hadn't let you win.

55:06.886 --> 55:08.471
How come everybody saw me
take your ass down?

55:08.555 --> 55:11.099
Watch his down.
Chest to back, and spin.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.271
Oh, Juan buy you those kicks, too?

55:16.771 --> 55:18.440
At least my dad comes to my matches.

55:18.523 --> 55:21.484
Your mom's too busy taking her clothes off
for random niggas.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.162
What?

55:33.121 --> 55:35.707
What's wrong? What? What, what, what?

55:35.790 --> 55:37.334
She probably hungry.

55:40.920 --> 55:42.297
Nyasa mom here.

55:44.632 --> 55:47.052
What's wrong?
You not happy to see Mommy?

55:48.720 --> 55:49.637
Just...

55:50.597 --> 55:52.807
Here. I gotta use the toilet.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.076
You should be happy for her.

56:14.454 --> 56:15.872
She should be with her real mom.

56:51.282 --> 56:53.535
Come on, Nicholas.
Come on, let's go.

56:53.618 --> 56:54.744
Nice and easy.

56:54.828 --> 56:56.454
Let's get this done.

56:57.747 --> 56:59.207
Lower your anklets.

57:00.625 --> 57:01.793
All right, Mo.

57:01.876 --> 57:02.836
Shake hands.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.095
Take a shot.

57:17.642 --> 57:19.936
Get to your bridge! Build up! Build up!

57:22.730 --> 57:25.233
That's it. Get in there, Mo.

57:26.359 --> 57:27.861
Where's that fire? Get in there.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.030
Build up!  Build up!  Build up!

57:31.114 --> 57:32.198
Build up!

57:36.202 --> 57:38.079
Get up! Get off your back! Off your back!

57:45.795 --> 57:46.629
Shake hands.

57:47.755 --> 57:50.675
Shake hands. Shake the coaches' hands.

57:56.097 --> 57:56.931
Hey!

57:57.932 --> 57:59.601
What the hell happened out there?

58:13.740 --> 58:15.492
Let's go, Huskies!

58:15.575 --> 58:17.118
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

58:17.202 --> 58:18.786
Let's go, Hedgeman!

58:18.870 --> 58:20.455
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

58:20.538 --> 58:22.165
Let's go, Huskies!

58:22.248 --> 58:23.833
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

58:30.548 --> 58:32.383
Everybody allowed to lose a match.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.846
What's that corny shit Coach say?

58:38.223 --> 58:40.475
There's no such thing as losing,
it's just...

58:40.558 --> 58:42.560
It's just winning and learning.

58:50.443 --> 58:52.445
You know how many times
my father seen me wrestle?

58:56.241 --> 58:57.408
You get used to it.

59:50.712 --> 59:52.505
All right, y'all, show your bets.

59:52.589 --> 59:53.840
Where the money at?

59:53.923 --> 59:55.300
You got money on the fat girl?

59:57.552 --> 59:59.137
That girl can do damage.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.180
Trust.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.890
Where the money at? Come on.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.017
Don't be cheap.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:05.643
What, y'all sleeping?

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.186
How much we need for the car wash?

01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:10.898
You and me dump Juan
and get the fuck out of here.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:13.401
No biting, no scratching,

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:16.029
no weapons, no hair pulling. Y'all got it?

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:19.657
Couple of fights...

01:00:21.242 --> 01:00:22.076
we'll be good.

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:29.208
All right, ladies,
center of the ring.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:36.799
Jab. Jab, jab.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.637
That's your combination. Jab straight up.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.598
Just when they think they got you,
mix it up.

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:45.558
Why do that when I can just do this?

01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:48.186
This ain't wrestling.
Shoot on somebody like that,

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:49.562
you gonna get your grill knocked out.

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.273
Mo!

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.818
Straight. Jab, jab, straight.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:59.155
- Come on.
- Jab, jab, straight. Jab, jab, straight.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:01.115
One, two. Uppercut, uppercut.

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.742
Get in there.  Grab my fucking neck.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:05.703
Grab. Grab the neck.
All right, come on. One, two.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.040
Hey!

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:11.000
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:14.003
It's all right, I got it, Coach.
Guys, have a seat.

01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:24.138
Let's go, Mo!

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.933
Mini Mo! Mini Mo!

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.107
Let's go, let's go!

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:03.177
Where the fuck you been?
I been calling and texting all night.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:04.804
What? My ringer was off.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:08.099
I told you to keep your phone on vibrate.
You about to miss the fight.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:10.059
- What?
- Hurry up, let's go.

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:12.729
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight. Goddamn. Shit.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.856
You lucky Juan kept your spot.

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.818
Only had 20 pounds on me, too.

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.028
What you talking about?
I had double unders.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.744
All right, y'all.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:31.581
So, tonight, we got a few virgin fighters
in the building.

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:34.000
So, I'ma need y'all
to put y'all hands together,

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.127
'cause we 'bout to turn up. Let's do it.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.257
Who the girl?

01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:44.886
Juan cousin.
Don't worry, she ain't got nothing on you.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.846
- All right, ladies.
- Show her who the queen.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.347
To the middle.

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:51.684
Y'all know what time it is, right?

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:55.480
Gonna need y'all to try to make this
as clean as possible.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.149
All right, got it? So, dap it up.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:00.193
And on my whistle,

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.110

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.662
What you running for? Get back in there.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:12.914
Come on, Naya.

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:21.339
Come on, Naya. Quit playing with her.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.301
- There it is.
- Get up, get up, get up.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:26.677
What you running for?

01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:35.228
Yeah!

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.815
Mo. Mo.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.322
You lost your fucking mind?

01:03:47.114 --> 01:03:48.449
What, you stalking me now?

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:50.993
- What's wrong with you?
- With me?

01:03:51.577 --> 01:03:55.998
The hell you doing in there, Mo?
We're one match away from finals.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.334
What's Coach gonna say
when he sees your face?

01:03:58.459 --> 01:03:59.710
Coach not gonna say shit.

01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:02.046
'Cause Coach not gonna know shit.
I swear, O,

01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:03.965
- you open your mouth...
- What'd I tell you?

01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:05.550
Them girls ain't got nothing on you.

01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:12.890
What up, O?

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.396
You see your girl get real in there?

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:20.481
Yeah.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.400
She did good.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:28.739
Anyways, I gotta go.

01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:30.449
You be safe.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:38.666
What'd I tell you?

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:41.210
I didn't say shit.
He came here by hisself.

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:43.254
Besides, he's not gonna say nothing.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.716
Where's the money?

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.763
Go ahead, feel that.

01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:57.768
Five hundred?

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.438
- You said winner take a G.
- What you want it for?

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.943
You lucky he even let you have a fight.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:08.863
It was just a warm-up.

01:05:11.198 --> 01:05:13.826
I'll tell you when you ready
for the big leagues.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.872
Black Moon.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:19.957
Das EFX.

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:23.920
Special Ed? This shit is old as me, yo.

01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:26.380
Who you think put me onto it?

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.469
You're a little mini-me, you know that?

01:05:31.552 --> 01:05:33.012
Malik call me Mini Mo.

01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:35.556
"Malik call me Mini Mo.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.477
- Malik say I'm fine."
- Ain't even like that.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.062
"Malik say I'm fine."

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:45.942
Whatever. He got a girl anyway.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.033
Hey, listen.

01:05:57.161 --> 01:05:57.995
Fuck Malik.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.373
You gonna be a legend.

01:06:01.248 --> 01:06:02.625
And not just in some...

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.379
high school yearbook.

01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:12.259
Make a name out here,
ain't nobody gonna fuck with you.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:18.683
Come here.

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:20.685
Come here.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.396
Gotta teach you how to duck.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:35.533
You can leave now.

01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:37.827
Ay... ¿Que te pasó?

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:39.912
Get the fuck out!

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.289
Lucila wants you off the team.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:45.251
You and I both know you didn't
get punched in the face wrestling.

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:48.504
Now, tell me what's going on
with your father,

01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:50.548
or I'll pull you off this team myself.

01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:53.592
Ain't got nothing to do with him.
I got beef with some girl.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.354
My dad runs one of Juan's parking lots.
I chill with him sometimes.

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.233
He got no place to live,
so he sleeps there.

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:14.447
This girl called him homeless, and...

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:16.991
I lost my shit.

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:24.123
Just 'cause I messed up,
it ain't the team's fault.

01:07:25.249 --> 01:07:26.959
I'm gonna win. We going to finals.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:48.856
He's stalling.

01:07:48.939 --> 01:07:50.524
He's gonna spank him, bro.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:53.027
We can bet money, bro.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:54.653
He got taken down.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.622
This is why
I don't watch white porn.

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:06.916
You are not watching
half the fight, Mo.

01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:08.000
We can put money on the fight.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.461
Chris been watching
the whole thing.

01:08:11.545 --> 01:08:14.215
What's up with you?
That time of the month?

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.341
Why you all...?

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:20.805
Come on. Come on.

01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:26.977
How long you been wrestling for?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.604
Since I was ten.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.564
Uncle wanted me to start boxing, actually.

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:34.859
I got punched in the mouth one time,
and I was like...

01:08:35.736 --> 01:08:36.694
"No, thank you."

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:41.575
My nickname was Wrong Way,
because every time a fight broke out,

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:45.371
all my friends running towards the shit,
I'm running the other way.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:48.582
They got a medical term for that.
It's called no balls-itis.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.752
Yeah, well...
when my dad came back around...

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.631
I almost got thrown off the team.

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:59.385
Tried to work the corners with him
and be tough...

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.970
You, dealing? I'd have loved to see that.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.890
If it wasn't for Coach riding my ass,
showing up to my house,

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.142
I would've dropped out.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:09.395
- Coach pay you to tell me that?
- What?

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.981
Fuck, no.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.899
You sound like one of them guest speakers.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.694
"Stay in school, kids. Don't do drugs."

01:09:17.611 --> 01:09:20.906
Yeah, well...
would've been one corny ass gangster.

01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:24.076
Damn, what do all these schools
want you for?

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.620
- These the good schools.
- 'Cause I put in the work.

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:29.372
Not like you. Look at yo ass.
You just faking.

01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:31.167
You think you a real wrestler.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.042
- Whatever.
- You think you're a wrestler.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.046
Now who the king?

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:00.756
Please...

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.762
- I thought you had more class.
- Ain't what you think. Nathalie.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:07.680
It ain't what you think.

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:10.015
- How about what I see?
- It ain't mean nothing.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.810
- What are you talking about?
- We don't mean nothing.

01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:13.852
Nathalie, just...

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.607
- You fucked him?
- Move out the way.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:19.775
You know she's pregnant?

01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:21.318
- I'm not playing.
- She was right.

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:24.280
You'll let anybody fuck you.

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:33.247
I'm ready for the real shit.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:34.707
Gotta get the fuck out of here.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.089
Watch these girls and learn.

01:11:57.771 --> 01:12:01.233
The underhook.
Fake and set single. Snap down.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.320
Good. Shuck. Release that forearm.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.155
Circle. Good, do it again.

01:12:08.073 --> 01:12:09.116
Good.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.576
All right. One, two.

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:23.339
That's not an underhook.
You holding hands with him, Tyson.

01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:28.010
Who taught you to shuck? Do it again.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:29.678
Actually, Coach...

01:12:31.805 --> 01:12:35.100
I'm kinda having some... female issues.

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:40.105
You worried about weight?

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.649
Nah, I'll be good if I don't eat.
I just...

01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:34.076
What color do you like?

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:39.248
I'm not allowed to have nails
'cause of wrestling.

01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:40.541
I make nice for you.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.168
Good luck for tomorrow.

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:08.068
How come you never had your own babies?

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.532
God no...

01:14:17.202 --> 01:14:18.954
God wouldn't let me.

01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:33.677
Okay, listen up. Remember...

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.512
there's no such thing as losing.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.306
There's only winning...

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.183
and learning.

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:42.311
I want you to take pride
in how far you've come,

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:44.688
and have faith in how far you can go.

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:46.440
All right? Bring it in.

01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:47.691
Give me some love.

01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:50.235
- Winners never quit.
- Quitters never win.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.487
- One, two, three!
- Hedgeman!

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:52.988
- Three, two, one!
- Huskies!

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.492
Hedgeman High
is happy to welcome Garner

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:58.327
for the last match of the season.

01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:00.162
I know you're all excited.

01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:02.247
We'll be getting started in a few minutes.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.707
How you feeling today?

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.876
- I'm good.
- Good.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.420
I'm counting on you.

01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:14.718
Get the hand-off! Look away!

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:19.389
We've got a takedown. One. Two.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.912
You got it! You got this!
You got this! You got this!

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:45.499
Okay, let's go.
Top man, work something.

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.835
I know shit got messed up the other night.

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:53.173
I crossed the line. Big time.

01:15:54.132 --> 01:15:55.217
We family now.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:58.512
I got a family.

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:01.098
Really?

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.850
What kind of father does that
to his daughter's face?

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.978
What kind of father
ditches his kid for college?

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.231
Look away. Rip 'em off.
There you go.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.151
That's a warning.

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:15.862
Better work something, top man.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:17.739
That's one.

01:16:18.323 --> 01:16:19.241
Two.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:20.867
Three.

01:16:21.785 --> 01:16:22.619
Four.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.415
That's two near falls.

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:29.710
Continue to work.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.546
Come on, ref, make 'em wrestle!

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:36.800
One.

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:38.594
Two.

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:40.304
Three.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:43.265
Two near falls.

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:48.520
Go, bottom man. Try to work something.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.940
Don't give nothing away.

01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:55.527
No, go to your base. Control his hands.

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:00.449
Get off your back!

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.618
- Off your back!
- One.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:04.369
Two.

01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:05.954
Three.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:07.914
Four.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:10.000
Five.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.712
Hold on three, top man.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:21.136
You lose your match,
we ain't going to finals.

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.140
Then you'd better win.

01:17:36.693 --> 01:17:39.988
- What you need all that for?
- I can't go back there now.

01:17:52.959 --> 01:17:55.045
All right, let's go!

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.757
- Go ahead, warm up.
- What about my shit?

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.384
What? It's fine.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.679
- Somebody gonna steal it.
- It's fine.

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:07.015
Go ahead, warm up.
Go ahead. Get in there.

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:11.228
We got some fresh talent
in the house.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.190
We about to get started.

01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:17.359
Settle down. Settle down.

01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:20.070
Tonight, we gonna see
if King D's fresh talent

01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:22.447
can face one of Brownsville's toughest:

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.491
Ms. Cheryl!

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:26.868
- Real champ right here.
- Show me your bets.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:28.328
Kill her, Mama.

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:29.996
Show me your bets.

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:34.000
Listen up. Tonight's your night.
There's five Gs with your name on it.

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:35.168
But you gotta win.

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:39.131
All right, now, show your bets.
Show your bets. Let's go.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.260
So, listen.

01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:44.720
No biting,

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:46.680
no scratching, no hair pulling,

01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:48.890
no weapons. Y'all got it?

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.100
All right, dap it up.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.480
All right, y'all.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:01.570
Come on, Mo.
You gotta fight back! Go!

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:07.117
Put your damn fists up!

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:30.015
Break it up. Break it up.

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:33.226
We got a fight tonight!

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:37.063
- Mo, what the fuck you doing out there?
- She's all over me.

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:39.566
You said you wanted to fight. This is it.

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:41.485
Now, you gonna sink or swim?

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:49.451
Come on, Mo, you gotta fight back!
Move your feet!

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:51.620
Come on, Mo!

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:53.914
No grabbing hair!

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.223
Stop the fucking round!

01:20:15.852 --> 01:20:18.814
All right. All right. Break it up.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.899
Break it up. Hey, you okay?

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.484
Go to the corner.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:24.569
You go to your corner.

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:30.033
Mo, next time she hit you,
just go down and stay down.

01:20:30.116 --> 01:20:31.952
- What?
- You ain't ready for this.

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:34.996
- I ain't no quitter.
- Mo!

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.748
Monique!

01:21:05.485 --> 01:21:08.113
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:38.852
Go!

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.688
Beat her ass, Mo! Beat her ass, Mo!

01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:42.939
Yeah! Yeah!

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:43.857
Yeah!

01:21:46.109 --> 01:21:48.653
That's it! That's it! We got it!

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.530
Yo, it's the police! Let's go!

01:21:50.614 --> 01:21:51.531
Come on!

01:21:57.829 --> 01:22:00.290
- I won. You seen it, right?
- We gotta split up.

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:02.584
- Where the fuck you want me to go?
- I don't know.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:04.961
- Go back to the Spanish lady house.
- Like this?

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:06.546
See seen me leaving the match.
She'll know.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.423
If I get caught,
you know where I'ma wind up.

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:10.592
- You get the money?
- You don't listen!

01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:12.385
I'll call you when we clear, all right?

01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:14.220
You the queen.

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:17.474
Mo. All right? You gonna be a legend.
Don't worry about all that.

01:22:18.141 --> 01:22:19.142
You the queen!

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.853
What about my stuff?

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:31.404
Yeah, right over here.

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:34.491
We got the perimeter surrounded.

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:40.038
Wow, look at this.

01:22:42.999 --> 01:22:44.042
Jesus.

01:24:19.012 --> 01:24:20.180
What?

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:23.933
What y'all looking at?

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.062
One stupid motherfucking wrestler.

01:24:29.355 --> 01:24:30.231
You win?

01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:37.363
I taught you good.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:55.215
Hey.

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:57.092
Keep icing.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:04.808
You understand I'm legally obligated
to report him?

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.028
When I was a kid,
I used to think I was mad lucky.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:21.449
Most of my friends didn't know their dad,
maybe for like...

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.410
five minutes on their birthday
or something, but...

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.288
I was living with mine.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.545
I wanted one of those
Razor scooters so bad.

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:36.339
Wouldn't shut up about it.

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.219
One day, D brought one home for me.

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:44.848
Told me... to make sure
I only rode them in Tilden Projects.

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:46.933
But I was mad proud.

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.060
Rode that shit everywhere.

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:53.022
One day, this kid at Marcus Garvey...

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.401
seen me with it and said it was his.

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:59.404
Said he carved his initials in the handle.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:03.449
Seen 'em, too.

01:26:06.077 --> 01:26:08.663
I told him my dad bought it new
and would fuck him up.

01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:12.333
Kid started stalking me.

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:14.961
One day, he seen me with D, and...

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.464
ratted him out to the cops.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:23.636
They found out he'd been
robbing people for Juan.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.225
You were a kid, Mo.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.605
You're not responsible for your father.

01:26:48.953 --> 01:26:50.121
I'm gonna do right.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.084
I swear, just...

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.257
don't make my dad do no more time
'cause of me.

01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:17.273
My mom says you can stay in Tanya's room
as long as you want.

01:27:17.982 --> 01:27:19.692
She sleeps in my mom's bed anyway.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.669
I know. I know.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:01.567
I'm very sorry for everything I've done.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:04.904
And...

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.787
you're the only foster mom
never kicked me out.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.376
And...

01:28:30.054 --> 01:28:31.597
You be a good girl now.

01:28:49.615 --> 01:28:52.285
Quit crying. Come on.
Why you always crying?

01:28:54.078 --> 01:28:56.289
Come on, stop crying. Stop crying.
Stop crying.

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:57.498
Shh, shh, shh.

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:01.627
I know. I know. It's all right.

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:03.296
Okay.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:31.324
She not only let herself down,
she let the whole team down.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.536
So, I put it to the group to decide.

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:39.040
Should she be suspended from finals
or not?

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.048
Omari had't won for her,
we wouldn't even be going to finals.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.674
Yeah, that's true.

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:51.177
Yeah.

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:56.974
Everybody has a right to make a mistake.

01:29:57.934 --> 01:29:59.018
That was a big one.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.814
But we gotta think about
what's best for the team.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.150
It's our first year going to finals.

01:30:06.609 --> 01:30:10.405
And all respect to Omari
for stepping up, but...

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.366
Mo's been killing it all season.

01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:20.832
Mo...

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.126
you have anything to add?

01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:34.429
I'm gonna do whatever's best for the team.

01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:37.056
Whatever y'all think that is.

01:30:40.977 --> 01:30:44.814
Let's put it to a vote.
All in favor of Mo starting on Friday.

01:31:05.918 --> 01:31:06.752
Mo.

01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:08.588
Mo.

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.381
Monique.

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:13.301
- You got my bag?
- Why would I?

01:31:13.384 --> 01:31:16.053
'Cause you stupid. Check yours.
Mine is missing.

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:23.519
Yeah. You lucky I asked.
Would've had to save your ass. Again.

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:26.355
You lucky you got big feet,
or I would've worn 'em anyway. Now move.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:31.235
- Hey, where you going?
- I forgot my bag inside.

01:31:33.279 --> 01:31:34.113
Mo.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:36.407
Nice hair.

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:38.242
Thanks.

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:40.369
Whoo!

01:31:41.537 --> 01:31:42.747
Get it, girl!

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:45.583
Girl, this ain't a runway.
Get out of here. Hurry up.

01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:00.765
Monique.

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:04.894
You got a match?

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:12.276
Now you the one hard to reach.

01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:16.364
Fame getting to you?

01:32:19.825 --> 01:32:21.536
Look, I know shit got fucked up.

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.207
I felt bad leaving after the fight.

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:28.668
For real.

01:32:30.753 --> 01:32:31.587
But you...

01:32:32.004 --> 01:32:36.175
You know I couldn't get caught
near all that. Mo. Mo, I...

01:32:37.426 --> 01:32:39.095
I tried to double our earnings.

01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:41.639
I was up for a little while, too.

01:32:42.014 --> 01:32:43.766
Mo. Monique.

01:32:45.351 --> 01:32:48.062
I just... I just got excited.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:49.814
That's all.

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:52.942
Seeing you in the ring, on that mat...

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:57.238
it reminded me of me.
All that flying.

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.324
You could do something with that.

01:33:02.326 --> 01:33:03.160
I know.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.794
How about we start our own thing?

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:16.549
Dude I know, he got a gym, and we...

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:17.967
Mo.

01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.968
Monique.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.803
Oh, it's like that now?

01:33:22.388 --> 01:33:24.557
Too good for your own pops now?

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:27.101
Jamal here?

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.854
All right. Chad? Where's Chad?

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:32.690
- Yo, we gonna hook in.
- All right, so...

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:37.194
we got one, two, three, four, five, six,

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:40.531
seven, eight, nine. Where's Tyson?

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:43.034
Somebody call and see if he's coming
on his own.

01:33:43.659 --> 01:33:45.453
I'm not waiting more than five minutes.

01:33:53.002 --> 01:33:53.878
Dad.

01:33:58.090 --> 01:33:59.216
All right, don't...

01:34:00.217 --> 01:34:01.886
Don't go soft on me now.

01:34:12.396 --> 01:34:14.106
How long you had my notebook?

01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:35.961
- Y'all ready to go to finals?
- We're going to finals!

01:34:36.045 --> 01:34:37.505
Yeah!

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:44.679
Let's go, Hedgeman!

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:46.472
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:34:51.477 --> 01:34:52.436
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.105
Let's go, Hedgeman!

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.690
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.400
Let's go, Huskies!

01:34:57.483 --> 01:34:58.901
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:34:58.984 --> 01:35:00.444
Let's go, Hedgeman!

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.029
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:03.614
Let's go, Huskies!

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:05.199
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:35:05.282 --> 01:35:06.784
Let's go, Huskies!

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:08.327
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:09.870
Let's go, Hedgeman!

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:11.414
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:35:11.497 --> 01:35:12.998
Let's go, Huskies!

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:14.750
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!
