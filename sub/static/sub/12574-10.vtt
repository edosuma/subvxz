00:21.962 --> 00:24.772
Richard, wake up.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.391
It's late.

00:29.392 --> 00:32.670
Richard, this is not the day
for you to sleep in.

00:32.671 --> 00:33.633
Verna?

00:38.021 --> 00:40.415
How'd I get back here?

00:40.416 --> 00:42.110
Where else would you be?

00:46.237 --> 00:48.066
I escaped from here.

00:48.067 --> 00:49.729
I was headed for my friends.

00:49.730 --> 00:51.426
Richard, you haven't
left the palace

00:51.427 --> 00:53.125
since you came here
to be trained as a Wizard.

00:54.923 --> 00:56.552
No.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.814
This is a trick.

01:03.046 --> 01:04.977
You're suffering
from Lacna'Han.

01:07.643 --> 01:09.672
When Wizards near the end
of their training,

01:09.673 --> 01:11.502
they're sometimes
plagued by

01:11.503 --> 01:13.035
lost memories
and strange dreams.

01:13.036 --> 01:16.434
The intense concentration
required by their studies

01:16.435 --> 01:18.899
overwhelms their minds.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.231
It'll pass.

01:21.232 --> 01:23.197
Now get dressed.

01:23.198 --> 01:25.296
There's someone
who needs to see you.

01:33.997 --> 01:36.061
Kahlan?

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.488 --> 01:48.587
I've missed you so much.

01:48.588 --> 01:50.288
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

01:51.821 --> 01:54.021
Kahlan,
something's wrong here.

01:57.454 --> 01:59.287
Sonia.

02:02.555 --> 02:05.121
Sonia, this is my friend,
Richard.

02:05.122 --> 02:06.954
Richard,
this is Sonia,

02:06.955 --> 02:09.354
my daughter.

02:11.489 --> 02:13.890
Daughter?

02:13.891 --> 02:16.558
Sweetheart, do you think you
could wait in the other room?

02:16.559 --> 02:17.959
I've a lot
of important things

02:17.960 --> 02:19.459
I need to talk about
with Richard.

02:19.460 --> 02:22.228
Sorry.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.962
She wriggled
out of my arms.

02:25.831 --> 02:29.661
Come here, you.
Oh, there we go.

02:29.662 --> 02:31.494
It's an honor
to meet Richard Cypher.

02:31.495 --> 02:34.626
Richard,
this is Phillip.

02:36.062 --> 02:38.995
The Seeker.

02:38.996 --> 02:40.862
You're the one
who took my place.

02:43.064 --> 02:44.897
No, there were two others
who came before.

02:46.232 --> 02:48.732
Richard...

02:50.667 --> 02:52.867
Phillip is my husband.

02:56.903 --> 02:59.302
She keeps asking
when we're going home.

02:59.303 --> 03:02.638
Sonia, this is our home now.

03:02.639 --> 03:05.372
Let's find you
something to eat, sweetheart.

03:09.709 --> 03:12.076
Kahlan, I've only been away
from you for a week.

03:12.077 --> 03:13.843
How can
you have a daughter?

03:13.844 --> 03:15.677
How can there have been
three Seekers named?

03:15.678 --> 03:18.679
Richard, you've been here
in the Palace of the Prophets

03:18.680 --> 03:21.680
for more than half a year.

03:21.681 --> 03:23.548
And for us
in the outside world,

03:23.549 --> 03:25.149
seven winters have passed.

03:28.284 --> 03:30.151
The Stone of Tears
was destroyed.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.819
And the rift
to the Underworld?

03:33.820 --> 03:36.821
It can never be closed.

03:38.690 --> 03:40.323
After Aydindril fell,

03:40.324 --> 03:42.157
we rounded up what
few survivors we could find

03:42.158 --> 03:43.624
and brought them here

03:43.625 --> 03:45.792
to make one final stand.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.761
They're all that's left?

03:49.762 --> 03:51.129
Maybe in the whole world.

03:53.297 --> 03:54.230
Where's Zedd?

03:58.968 --> 04:00.836
I'm so sorry, Richard.

04:00.837 --> 04:03.871
He gave his life
defending Aydindril.

04:03.872 --> 04:06.272
He died a hero.

04:11.909 --> 04:13.209
And Cara?

04:13.210 --> 04:15.044
On our way out of the New World,

04:15.045 --> 04:16.946
we were ambushed
by a baneling army.

04:16.947 --> 04:19.281
Cara got cut off
from the rest of us,

04:19.281 --> 04:21.616
and we haven't
seen her since.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.757
I've been here
for seven years

04:28.758 --> 04:30.893
and you've never tried
to contact me?

04:30.894 --> 04:33.195
I got your letter.

04:33.196 --> 04:34.931
That your training
was almost complete.

04:34.932 --> 04:35.932
What letter?

04:35.933 --> 04:38.732
That's why we came.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.365
With your Wizard powers,

04:40.366 --> 04:42.398
maybe you can still help us
fight the Keeper.

04:42.399 --> 04:45.398
I didn't write this.

04:45.399 --> 04:47.868
It's in your hand.

04:47.869 --> 04:50.036
You couldn't have
had a child with Phillip.

04:50.037 --> 04:51.804
You would never
confess the Seeker.

04:51.805 --> 04:54.473
I didn't.

04:56.776 --> 04:59.878
Many years ago, we were attacked
by the Sisters of the Dark

04:59.879 --> 05:01.713
and they stole
my Confessor powers.

05:03.650 --> 05:05.950
Once I lost them,
I was able to...

05:12.525 --> 05:14.826
Kahlan, if what
you're saying is true,

05:14.827 --> 05:16.528
I'll help you.

05:16.529 --> 05:18.430
But I don't believe
any of it.

05:18.431 --> 05:20.265
You think I'm lying?

05:20.266 --> 05:21.700
No. Never.

05:23.502 --> 05:25.103
But the Sisters
have been lying to me

05:25.104 --> 05:27.237
ever since I got here.

05:27.238 --> 05:28.772
That's why
I had to escape.

05:28.773 --> 05:31.274
But then
I woke up back here.

05:31.275 --> 05:32.609
They're trying to tell me

05:32.610 --> 05:34.211
I lost my memory
because of my training.

05:34.212 --> 05:37.114
Now you're telling me the Keeper
is on the verge of winning.

05:37.115 --> 05:40.886
I think this is some
kind of trick or spell.

05:46.292 --> 05:47.960
I know you, Richard.

05:47.961 --> 05:49.828
And if you think
something's wrong,

05:49.829 --> 05:51.696
then I'm gonna
help you find the truth.

05:54.467 --> 05:56.735
What did you do to me?

05:56.736 --> 05:59.238
Verna told me
about your confusion.

05:59.239 --> 06:03.335
I assure you, everything
she said was perfectly true.

06:03.336 --> 06:06.634
You've been right here
training for months.

06:06.635 --> 06:08.836
You're lying.
I'm not.

06:08.837 --> 06:10.971
Your training
is nearly complete.

06:10.972 --> 06:13.006
Then why don't
I have any Wizard powers?

06:13.007 --> 06:15.574
But you do.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.977
Lift that urn
with your mind.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.313
I can't do that.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.114
Command it to rise, Wizard.

06:25.350 --> 06:28.119
You have to try.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.243
Banelings have
breached the gates.

08:00.244 --> 08:02.946
Oh, sweetheart.

08:02.947 --> 08:04.314
It's gonna be all right.

08:04.315 --> 08:06.248
Mama and Papa will protect you.

08:17.559 --> 08:19.526
You're bleeding.

08:19.527 --> 08:21.428
It'll be fine.

08:21.429 --> 08:23.530
The banelings have
cut off all the exits.

08:23.531 --> 08:24.931
There's no escape.

08:30.470 --> 08:33.772
Don't give up.

08:33.773 --> 08:37.644
As long as we're alive,
the Keeper hasn't won yet.

08:37.645 --> 08:40.082
These walls are strong.

08:41.519 --> 08:42.886
These walls are strong...

08:45.625 --> 08:48.426
And so is our will.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.095
We can survive.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.766
No matter how bad
things get...

08:56.502 --> 08:58.536
as long as we stick together,

08:58.537 --> 09:00.872
there's always hope.

09:05.709 --> 09:07.442
We have to help him.

09:07.443 --> 09:09.177
There's no help
for him now.

09:09.178 --> 09:12.480
The Valley of Perdition was
created by the ancient Wizards

09:12.481 --> 09:16.050
as a defense against
intruders from the New World.

09:16.051 --> 09:18.253
After Richard
escaped from the palace,

09:18.254 --> 09:21.155
he must have
stumbled into it.

09:21.156 --> 09:23.524
The magic makes those
who enter it

09:23.525 --> 09:26.061
experience
their worst fears.

09:26.062 --> 09:28.830
There is no power
that can awaken them.

09:30.765 --> 09:33.600
But if he stays there,
he'll starve to death.

09:33.601 --> 09:36.436
His visions will kill him
long before that.

09:36.437 --> 09:39.306
What happens to his mind
also happens in his body.

09:43.211 --> 09:46.046
If he can't get out on his own,
we have to go in after him.

09:46.047 --> 09:49.850
The magic of Perdition would
overwhelm even my powers.

09:49.851 --> 09:52.052
If I give you my Han,

09:52.053 --> 09:56.189
maybe you would have enough
power to withstand the magic.

09:56.190 --> 09:57.190
No.

09:57.191 --> 09:59.759
In 3,000 years,

09:59.760 --> 10:02.535
no one who has wandered
into the Valley of Perdition

10:02.536 --> 10:04.572
has ever escaped.

10:04.573 --> 10:06.308
Prelate,
we can't let this happen.

10:06.309 --> 10:09.278
It's the hand
of the Creator at work.

10:09.279 --> 10:11.647
How can you say that?

10:11.648 --> 10:13.749
The Prophecy says

10:13.750 --> 10:16.918
if Richard Cypher
continues his quest,

10:16.919 --> 10:20.722
he will help the Keeper
destroy all life.

10:20.723 --> 10:24.926
But his death here will ensure
that never happens.

10:44.531 --> 10:46.432
Hello, Sister Nicci.

10:48.235 --> 10:50.870
You have no right
to hold me prisoner.

10:50.871 --> 10:53.406
I have the right
to do far worse.

10:53.407 --> 10:55.843
You betrayed our order
by helping

10:55.844 --> 10:57.912
Richard Cypher escape
from this palace.

10:57.913 --> 11:00.915
You were keeping him here
against his will.

11:00.916 --> 11:03.650
You only freed him so that
he would fulfill the Prophecy

11:03.651 --> 11:05.519
and deliver the Stone

11:05.520 --> 11:07.587
to the Keeper of the Underworld,
whom you serve.

11:11.091 --> 11:15.294
Name the Sisters of the Dark
or you will die.

11:15.295 --> 11:17.629
You'll need me alive

11:17.630 --> 11:19.564
if you ever hope
to remove my power

11:19.565 --> 11:21.232
and restore it to Richard.

11:21.233 --> 11:24.201
That is no longer possible.
After you freed Richard

11:24.202 --> 11:27.604
from the palace, he wandered
into the Valley of Perdition.

11:29.540 --> 11:31.840
Richard is going to die.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.910
You failed, Nicci.

11:35.911 --> 11:38.246
The new Seeker
has already been named.

11:38.247 --> 11:41.082
He's on his way
to the Stone of Tears.

11:43.585 --> 11:46.119
The compass is still
pointing the same way.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.088
Maybe it's leading us
to the Stone of Tears.

11:48.089 --> 11:50.923
No, it's leading us to Richard.
I'm sure of it.

11:50.924 --> 11:52.558
Wizard, we've been
travelling for weeks.

11:52.559 --> 11:54.460
Wouldn't it be faster if
you turned us into birds?

11:54.461 --> 11:56.628
How would Leo
carry the Sword of Truth?

11:56.629 --> 11:58.363
In his beak?

12:00.565 --> 12:03.233
So, what kind of bird
would you wanna be?

12:03.234 --> 12:04.935
What difference does it make?

12:04.936 --> 12:07.270
I'm curious.

12:07.271 --> 12:08.638
A blue-tailed sea hawk.

12:08.639 --> 12:10.005
That's a noble animal.

12:10.006 --> 12:12.007
One that attacks
without warning.

12:12.008 --> 12:14.443
Nothing escapes its claws.

12:14.444 --> 12:16.445
Do you know what
kind of bird I'd be?

12:16.446 --> 12:19.315
A parrot that doesn't know
when to stop talking?

12:22.319 --> 12:24.152
A banded falcon.

12:24.153 --> 12:26.120
They're the only birds
that blue-tailed sea hawks

12:26.121 --> 12:28.422
will fly with.

12:29.590 --> 12:33.190
Keep going. I have
a stone in my boot.

12:36.294 --> 12:37.628
Leo has
feelings for you.

12:37.629 --> 12:39.196
Same feelings
all men have.

12:39.197 --> 12:40.531
Fog's even thicker up ahead.

12:40.532 --> 12:43.166
It means
we're getting close.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.668
The fog hides
the path to the Old World.

12:54.743 --> 12:57.279
The compass is telling us
to go straight through.

13:03.019 --> 13:05.687
We're coming, Richard.

13:11.525 --> 13:12.525
We're gonna need...

13:12.526 --> 13:14.960
More water.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.395
Check the cellar.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.263
See if there are
any more water barrels.

13:18.264 --> 13:21.632
I already tried.
The cellar's locked.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.134
The Prelate must have a key.

13:24.135 --> 13:26.469
<i>Water won't save anybody,
Richard.</i>

13:26.470 --> 13:28.504
It's too late.

13:28.505 --> 13:30.672
The Keeper's victory
is at hand.

13:30.673 --> 13:32.674
You're only delaying
the inevitable.

13:32.675 --> 13:34.742
It's only inevitable
if we let it happen.

13:34.743 --> 13:37.811
It's better to surrender
our light to the Creator

13:37.812 --> 13:40.547
than let the banelings
drag us to the Keeper.

13:40.548 --> 13:43.550
You're gonna kill yourselves?

13:43.551 --> 13:48.488
Creator, give us strength
for what we must now do.

13:48.489 --> 13:51.989
And we will surrender our
strength for what you must do.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.757
What about
the sanctity of life?

13:53.758 --> 13:56.827
Killing yourself is an offense
to the Creator.

13:56.828 --> 14:00.163
The fight is already lost.
Let us go home.

14:00.164 --> 14:02.698
She wouldn't want you to give
up. She'd want you to fight

14:02.699 --> 14:04.834
for every single life!

14:14.678 --> 14:15.845
No!

14:22.119 --> 14:23.887
Give me the names, Nicci.

14:25.389 --> 14:27.390
You'll pay for this.

14:27.391 --> 14:28.958
How?

14:28.959 --> 14:30.993
Not even the powers
you stole from Richard

14:30.994 --> 14:33.396
can overcome the rada'han
around your neck.

14:33.397 --> 14:35.064
It is you who will pay.

14:38.601 --> 14:40.736
Give me the names.

14:47.042 --> 14:48.642
You want the names?

14:48.643 --> 14:51.911
I'll give them to you.

14:51.912 --> 14:54.580
Greta, Solange, Naya,

14:54.581 --> 14:57.316
Jodelle, Reyna,

14:57.317 --> 15:00.153
Roslyn, Liliana and Corrine.

15:00.154 --> 15:02.622
We need to find them
immediately.

15:02.623 --> 15:04.657
You're too late!

15:04.658 --> 15:08.361
They're already in hiding,
doing the Keeper's work.

15:13.868 --> 15:15.769
Keeper of the Underworld,

15:15.770 --> 15:18.239
we faithfully do your bidding.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.508
Now, in the name
of your servant Nicci,

15:20.509 --> 15:24.045
we humbly ask
that you do ours.

15:40.261 --> 15:42.662
You are a servant
of the Keeper.

15:42.663 --> 15:44.431
Go, quickly.

16:51.062 --> 16:53.263
No one's seen them
anywhere in the palace.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.173
She's gone.

17:10.012 --> 17:13.414
And she's taken
Richard's magic with her.

17:16.416 --> 17:21.220
The most powerful Han
the world has ever known.

17:29.347 --> 17:30.114
Sister Nicci.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.350
You did well, Sisters,

17:32.351 --> 17:34.318
but there's no time
for celebrating.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.320
The Keeper's work
remains unfinished.

17:36.321 --> 17:39.323
Richard Cypher is trapped
in the Valley of Perdition.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.827
And we need to get him out
so he can fulfill the Prophecy

17:42.828 --> 17:44.795
and deliver the Stone
to the Keeper.

17:44.796 --> 17:47.866
There is another way to ensure
the Keeper's victory over life.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.668
While you were
being held prisoner,

17:50.669 --> 17:53.905
a new Prophecy
was revealed.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.174
It is now written that, "As long
as the Mother Confessor's

17:56.175 --> 17:59.510
pure heart beats,
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

18:00.979 --> 18:02.513
Then her heart
must be stopped.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.982
We've been saved the trouble
of having to look for her.

18:04.983 --> 18:07.251
Our spies have learned
that she and her friends

18:07.252 --> 18:09.286
are already headed toward
the Palace of the Prophets.

18:10.821 --> 18:14.424
This is the hand
of the Keeper at work.

18:14.425 --> 18:18.295
I look forward to
the Mother Confessor's arrival.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.036
I don't think this weather
will hold much longer.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.838
We should find shelter.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.073
No. We need to cover
as much ground as we can

18:29.074 --> 18:30.642
before the rain stops us.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.279
We used to hear
stories about Richard

18:34.280 --> 18:35.780
when I fought
for the resistance.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.116
Where did you fight?
West Lorcastor.

18:39.317 --> 18:41.217
Then you fought
the battle of Stone Canyon.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.887
Yeah.
That was a great victory.

18:43.888 --> 18:45.287
Well, it almost wasn't.

18:45.288 --> 18:47.056
The D'Harans
had us surrounded.

18:47.057 --> 18:49.058
We were out
of food and water.

18:49.059 --> 18:50.626
Our commander deserted us.

18:50.627 --> 18:52.061
You still managed
to defeat them.

18:52.062 --> 18:55.331
A rider arrived with news

18:55.332 --> 18:58.231
that the Seeker had
driven back the D'Harans

18:58.232 --> 18:59.599
at the Battle
of Rising Ridge.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.968
It was one man
against hundreds.

19:02.969 --> 19:06.004
It inspired us to break through
the D'Haran line.

19:07.574 --> 19:09.609
I hope you get the chance
to tell him that story.

19:09.610 --> 19:12.212
I will.

19:19.253 --> 19:21.988
Is everything
all right?

19:21.989 --> 19:24.090
Accepting that
we had to name a new Seeker

19:24.091 --> 19:26.092
wasn't easy for me.

19:26.093 --> 19:27.460
But if anyone
other than Richard

19:27.461 --> 19:28.928
had to take up
the Sword of Truth,

19:28.929 --> 19:31.630
I'm thankful it was Leo.

19:33.633 --> 19:36.135
He's gonna
help us find Richard.

19:49.682 --> 19:52.417
There's somebody
at the gate.

20:08.201 --> 20:10.270
Richard, let me in.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.040
No.
It's Cara.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.175
The last time we saw her

20:15.176 --> 20:17.044
she was cut off from us
by a thousand banelings.

20:17.045 --> 20:18.979
I got away from them.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.847
It's impossible.
She's one of them.

20:20.848 --> 20:23.417
Richard, you know I would never
take the Keeper's deal.

20:28.390 --> 20:30.024
I'm letting her in.

20:33.327 --> 20:34.894
It's a trick, Richard.

20:34.895 --> 20:37.663
I'm not
leaving her out there.

20:37.664 --> 20:38.998
If you're wrong--
I'm not.

20:45.239 --> 20:48.174
It was a trick,
you fool!

20:48.175 --> 20:49.375
She is a baneling.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.515
No!

21:03.590 --> 21:04.890
Mother!

22:10.154 --> 22:12.589
Kahlan, don't move!

22:12.590 --> 22:14.924
I can heal you.
No.

22:17.227 --> 22:19.727
My husband

22:19.728 --> 22:22.463
and my daughter are dead.

22:22.464 --> 22:25.232
I don't wanna
live without them.

22:48.024 --> 22:49.892
What have I done?

22:52.996 --> 22:55.465
What have I done?

23:08.950 --> 23:10.183
Your back's hurting?

23:10.184 --> 23:11.951
I'm fine.

23:13.554 --> 23:15.622
Your back only hurts
when you're worried.

23:15.623 --> 23:17.056
Worried?

23:17.057 --> 23:19.259
I'm brimming with confidence.

23:23.296 --> 23:25.465
You're wondering what you
might've done differently

23:25.466 --> 23:27.000
so that Richard
never would have gone off

23:27.001 --> 23:28.301
with the Sisters of the Light?

23:35.141 --> 23:36.841
You're always the one
to calm our fears

23:36.842 --> 23:39.477
and reassure us that
everything will work out.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.712
But you're allowed
to be worried too.

23:47.750 --> 23:49.851
The river's too swollen
to cross.

23:49.852 --> 23:51.820
We'll have to wait
for the rain to stop.

23:51.821 --> 23:54.456
We should make the most of
this delay and get some sleep.

23:54.457 --> 23:56.655
There's no telling
when we'll get another chance.

23:56.656 --> 23:58.455
I'll keep first watch.

24:02.993 --> 24:04.459
I hope the rain stops.

24:10.364 --> 24:12.765
It's really coming down now.

24:12.766 --> 24:14.266
Yes.

24:14.267 --> 24:17.335
Before the sun went down, I saw
some clear skies to the west.

24:17.336 --> 24:19.871
Hopefully, the wind will
cooperate and send them our way.

24:19.872 --> 24:22.907
That would be good.

24:27.879 --> 24:29.947
I do love the rain, though.

24:29.948 --> 24:31.282
The way it makes
the earth smell--

24:40.425 --> 24:43.494
You know, where I come from,
the man does that.

24:43.495 --> 24:45.897
Then what are you
waiting for?

25:09.782 --> 25:12.517
What is it?

25:12.518 --> 25:14.219
For you.

25:15.621 --> 25:17.722
It matches your leather.

25:22.461 --> 25:23.962
Have I offended you?

25:23.963 --> 25:26.132
Flowers make me sneeze.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.169
Didn't last night
mean anything to you?

25:28.170 --> 25:29.403
It was pleasurable.

25:29.404 --> 25:32.574
But it doesn't make me
your mate for life.

25:32.575 --> 25:34.843
I don't remember asking you
to marry me.

25:34.844 --> 25:36.378
But I do care about you.

25:36.379 --> 25:39.481
And I think you feel
the same.

25:39.482 --> 25:41.583
You're mistaken.

25:47.854 --> 25:50.122
You know, I've been
watching you for weeks,

25:50.123 --> 25:52.657
and I can tell
you care about him.

25:52.658 --> 25:55.795
You can't read
a Mord-Sith.

25:55.796 --> 25:58.133
The Confessor in me can't.

25:58.134 --> 26:00.202
But the woman can tell
you're not telling the truth.

26:02.070 --> 26:04.972
It's a hard world we live in,
Cara.

26:04.973 --> 26:07.877
We don't get many chances.

26:07.878 --> 26:10.480
If you have feelings for Leo,
you should tell him.

26:11.882 --> 26:13.716
We're here!

26:46.180 --> 26:47.681
Kahlan Amnell,

26:47.682 --> 26:50.649
it's wonderful
to see you again.

26:52.051 --> 26:54.786
You were just a child
the last time I saw you,

26:54.787 --> 26:56.589
I doubt you'd remember me.

26:56.590 --> 26:59.425
But my dear Sister
who raised you always said

26:59.426 --> 27:01.694
you were destined to become
a great woman.

27:01.695 --> 27:06.198
And now here you are,
the Mother Confessor.

27:06.199 --> 27:08.700
I'm honored to see you again,
Prelate.

27:08.701 --> 27:10.068
But I'm here for Richard.

27:10.069 --> 27:13.437
I'm surprised that you'd
travel all this way.

27:13.438 --> 27:17.374
I thought you'd be continuing
the quest with the new Seeker.

27:17.375 --> 27:19.876
We have reason to believe
that Richard may be in danger.

27:19.877 --> 27:21.311
Is he all right?

27:21.312 --> 27:23.579
He's perfectly fine.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.114
He's in training right now.

27:25.115 --> 27:26.749
But I'll tell him
you're here.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.551
Thank you.

27:29.552 --> 27:32.621
In the meantime, please make
yourselves comfortable.

27:32.622 --> 27:35.456
You must be exhausted
from your long journey.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.198
Why didn't you tell
the Mother Confessor the truth?

27:46.199 --> 27:47.966
Because she'd go
to the Valley of Perdition

27:47.967 --> 27:49.067
and try to save Richard.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.602
She'd end up trapped
like he is.

27:50.603 --> 27:52.503
And when she realizes
you've lied to her?

27:52.504 --> 27:55.139
By then I will have
sealed the palace.

27:58.976 --> 28:00.843
You're trapping them here?

28:00.844 --> 28:02.977
The Prophecy says
the Keeper can't win

28:02.978 --> 28:05.046
as long as
the Mother Confessor lives.

28:05.047 --> 28:08.882
The Sisters of the Dark will
stop at nothing to kill her.

28:08.883 --> 28:11.684
Keeping Kahlan here is the only
way to ensure her survival.

28:13.119 --> 28:16.354
Richard will soon be dead,
and once he is,

28:16.355 --> 28:17.956
we'll tell her the truth.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.459
She'll understand we were acting
in her best interest.

28:32.938 --> 28:35.205
<i>Congratulations, brother.</i>

28:37.608 --> 28:40.743
You are now
the last person

28:40.744 --> 28:43.680
who will ever live.

28:47.818 --> 28:52.289
Unfortunately, there is no one
left to kill you.

28:52.290 --> 28:54.958
So you will have
the rest of your days

28:54.959 --> 28:57.961
to contemplate your complete

28:57.962 --> 28:59.896
and utter failure.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.600
What is taking so long?

29:29.601 --> 29:33.504
I'm sure Richard is just
as impatient to see you.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.240
Something isn't right.

29:35.241 --> 29:38.009
Did you sense the Prelate
wasn't telling you the truth?

29:38.010 --> 29:39.745
No.

29:39.746 --> 29:41.947
But maybe a woman
as powerful as she is

29:41.948 --> 29:43.849
has the ability to prevent me
from reading her.

29:45.652 --> 29:47.620
<i>( dramatic theme playing</i>

29:55.095 --> 29:56.562
Leo.

29:56.563 --> 29:58.666
Yes?

30:07.311 --> 30:09.245
I have something
I need to say to you.

30:09.246 --> 30:10.547
I'm listening.

30:15.754 --> 30:16.988
I just wanted to say...

30:16.989 --> 30:18.122
Where's Richard?

30:18.123 --> 30:19.824
It shouldn't be much longer now.

30:19.825 --> 30:21.359
The Prelate asked me
to serve you a meal.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.095
We're not hungry.

30:23.096 --> 30:25.230
Take us to Richard.
I can't do that.

30:25.231 --> 30:26.531
He's in training.

30:26.532 --> 30:28.264
No one's to disturb him
until he's finished.

30:28.265 --> 30:30.597
You're lying.

30:32.396 --> 30:33.827
Tell us where he is.

30:33.828 --> 30:35.593
I swear on the Creator,
I don't know.

30:35.594 --> 30:37.392
Then who does?

30:37.393 --> 30:39.594
Only the Prelate.
Take us to her.

30:39.595 --> 30:42.497
Now.

30:42.498 --> 30:44.064
Richard's not here.

30:44.065 --> 30:45.132
Where is he?

30:45.133 --> 30:47.167
I can't tell you that.

30:47.168 --> 30:49.335
Well, if you won't tell us,
we'll find him ourselves.

30:49.336 --> 30:50.769
You won't be able to.

30:50.770 --> 30:53.171
I've sealed the palace.

30:53.172 --> 30:55.473
You're holding us prisoner?

30:55.474 --> 30:58.376
No, I'm protecting you.

31:00.779 --> 31:02.913
This is a new Prophecy.

31:02.914 --> 31:06.416
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

31:06.417 --> 31:09.752
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

31:09.753 --> 31:12.354
If you leave the palace
to look for Richard,

31:12.355 --> 31:13.789
your life will be at risk.

31:13.790 --> 31:16.824
There are Sisters who serve
the Keeper who will kill you.

31:16.825 --> 31:18.659
I'll deal with them.
No.

31:20.195 --> 31:23.030
The Mother Confessor stays here,
under our protection,

31:23.031 --> 31:24.798
until the Keeper is defeated.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.266
Zedd will get through
your magic.

31:26.267 --> 31:28.267
We're leaving now.

31:39.944 --> 31:41.277
No!

31:41.278 --> 31:42.578
Only a Sister of the Light

31:42.579 --> 31:44.881
can remove the Dacra
without killing him.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.687
Take it out of him.

31:52.688 --> 31:55.556
Confess her
and I'll kill the Wizard.

31:55.557 --> 31:58.058
You'd better hope your magic
is faster than Wizard's Fire.

31:58.059 --> 31:59.493
You may kill me,

31:59.494 --> 32:01.227
but you won't be able
to get out of the palace.

32:01.228 --> 32:04.162
Only I can unseal it.

32:18.208 --> 32:20.876
The magic is quicker than you.

32:20.877 --> 32:22.911
If anyone throws another Dacra,
the Prelate dies.

32:34.220 --> 32:37.022
You're defying
the will of the Creator.

32:37.023 --> 32:40.491
The Creator's will?
Or yours?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.159
They are the same.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.927
Is it the Creator's will

32:44.928 --> 32:47.330
that we hold
the Mother Confessor hostage?

32:48.732 --> 32:50.232
That Nicci is on the loose

32:50.233 --> 32:53.268
with the most powerful Han
ever known?

32:53.269 --> 32:56.439
And that Richard will die
alone in Perdition?

32:56.440 --> 32:59.841
Where is he?

32:59.842 --> 33:02.977
I'll take you to him.

33:02.978 --> 33:07.782
Unseal the palace now.

33:19.528 --> 33:23.330
Our spy reports the Mother
Confessor's reached the palace.

33:24.799 --> 33:28.535
Then the Sisters of the Light
can watch me kill her.

33:28.536 --> 33:31.839
The message says they've already
come and left.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.008
Does the message say

33:35.009 --> 33:37.644
where they're headed?

33:44.784 --> 33:46.151
Richard!

33:46.152 --> 33:47.586
You can't go down there.

33:47.587 --> 33:49.988
It's the Valley of Perdition.

33:49.989 --> 33:52.924
No one who's wandered into it
has ever escaped.

33:52.925 --> 33:56.093
He's in the grip
of powerful magic.

33:56.094 --> 33:59.629
It's causing him to have visions
of his worst fears.

33:59.630 --> 34:01.030
Eventually,
they will kill him.

34:01.031 --> 34:03.699
And the same thing will happen
to you if you go to help him.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.734
We can't just let him die.

34:05.735 --> 34:07.535
Kahlan!

34:07.536 --> 34:10.371
We can't afford to lose
the Mother Confessor.

34:10.371 --> 34:13.072
I'll use all my powers
to try to get him out.

34:20.114 --> 34:22.447
Get down!

35:01.961 --> 35:03.694
Zedd!

35:05.030 --> 35:07.030
Zedd.

35:43.595 --> 35:44.761
Kahlan.

35:47.732 --> 35:49.332
I'm sorry I failed you.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.300
All is forgiven, Richard.

35:52.301 --> 35:55.470
You don't need
to be in pain anymore.

35:55.471 --> 35:57.371
You don't need
to be alone.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.141
<i>You can be with me again,
forever.</i>

36:01.142 --> 36:03.843
How?

36:05.245 --> 36:08.847
All you have to do...

36:08.848 --> 36:10.182
is die.

36:12.017 --> 36:14.752
Oh...

36:14.753 --> 36:16.020
<i>I can't do that.</i>

36:16.021 --> 36:17.121
<i>You can.</i>

36:17.122 --> 36:19.557
There's nothing to fear.

36:19.558 --> 36:24.160
All you have to do
is take my hand

36:24.161 --> 36:26.596
and come with me...

36:48.925 --> 36:50.893
Come with me.
Please.

36:55.732 --> 36:57.800
What's wrong, Richard?

36:59.972 --> 37:01.274
You're not Kahlan.

37:03.511 --> 37:05.479
Of course I am.
No.

37:05.480 --> 37:09.552
Kahlen would never
ask me to die.

37:09.553 --> 37:10.987
She'd tell me
to keep living.

37:10.988 --> 37:15.025
She'd say there could still be
life somewhere in the world.

37:15.026 --> 37:17.727
Look around, Richard.

37:17.728 --> 37:19.996
There's nothing left
in the World of the Living.

37:19.997 --> 37:22.766
You're lying.

37:22.767 --> 37:27.269
And if you're lying,
you're not real.

37:27.270 --> 37:28.938
None of this is real.

37:32.838 --> 37:34.566
I have to go.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.801
No!

38:49.802 --> 38:53.505
Leo!

40:32.698 --> 40:34.398
You don't know how happy I am
to see you.

40:41.207 --> 40:42.808
Cara?

40:53.852 --> 40:55.750
Can you give him
the Breath of Life?

41:00.288 --> 41:03.723
No.

41:03.724 --> 41:05.591
His body is beyond saving.

41:14.267 --> 41:15.534
Leo gave his life

41:15.535 --> 41:18.035
for the Mother Confessor.

41:18.036 --> 41:20.237
In this and in every way,

41:20.238 --> 41:22.973
he brought honor to the title

41:22.974 --> 41:25.508
"Seeker of Truth."

41:25.509 --> 41:28.244
We shall always
remember his courage.

41:28.245 --> 41:30.715
We shall never
forget his name.

41:48.146 --> 41:50.781
I do care about you.

42:12.935 --> 42:15.436
You're going to need this back.

42:20.708 --> 42:23.242
We have a quest
to get back to.
