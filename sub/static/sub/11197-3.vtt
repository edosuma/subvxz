00:08.160 --> 00:10.720
Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:11.960 --> 00:15.560
First we must rescue Thor.
He is a prisoner of the Goa'uld.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.080
l am Anubis.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.520
This device... will be implanted
into your brain.

00:21.640 --> 00:25.520
lt will form a link between your mind
and the ship's computer.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.080
Your knowledge will simply be
downloaded into our memory banks.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.320
- O'Neill?
- Thor?

00:32.439 --> 00:36.600
l am using the internal communication
system to synthesise my voice.

00:36.680 --> 00:42.320
l may be able to rewrite some minor
subroutines in the security protocol.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.920
Lord Anubis, the Asgard prisoner is gone.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.280
He will not get far.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.560
- You cannot take me with you.
- Why not?

00:58.640 --> 01:02.320
The link between myself and
the Goa'uld ship has not been severed.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.160
They managed to remove the device
from his brain, but it may be too late.

01:06.280 --> 01:09.120
Apparently he's lapsed into a coma.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.040
Looks like your analysis was right, Sam.
lt's dead in space but intact.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.560
- Has Anubis done this before?
- This is a first.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.640
Must've been crazy around the SGC
when it showed up.

01:36.760 --> 01:37.920
You've no idea.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.560
l have a pretty good idea. l used to be
an Air Force general, remember?

01:42.640 --> 01:45.200
Are we there yet?

01:45.280 --> 01:47.680
Not yet, sir. Close enough
to do some scans.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.680
Scanned anything yet?

01:49.760 --> 01:51.600
- Nothing, sir.
- Nothing?

01:51.720 --> 01:56.720
lt's in a stable orbit, shields and weapons
are down, and it's emitting no EM.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.200
- Still just kinda sittin' there.
- Yes, sir.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.200
lf they were going to attack Earth,
they'd have done it by now.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.880
What are you smiling at?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.520
lt's just that it's my first time... in space.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.400
Ah.

02:16.480 --> 02:22.080
We'd only begun to consider space travel.
To actually be out here is...

02:23.720 --> 02:26.800
- lt's amazing.
- lndeed.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.720
Until something goes horribly wrong.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.120
What's our status?

02:33.240 --> 02:37.160
The ship should be just
a few hundred kilometres dead ahead.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.760
There.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.840
Ship ahoy-hoy

02:51.560 --> 02:53.920
That's incredible.

02:57.800 --> 03:03.200
I´m not 100%, but this could be the same
ship Anubis used to kidnap Thor.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.240
Now we know why they haven't attacked.

03:06.360 --> 03:10.560
- There's no life signs.
- The escape pods have been jettisoned.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.920
The ship has not been damaged in battle.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.760
Power and life supports are functioning
normally. There's nobody on board.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.720
Why would they abandon
a perfectly good ship?

03:22.400 --> 03:25.040
They wouldn't.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.040
Jack, rather than fly into a cargo bay,

04:39.160 --> 04:43.200
l recommend we use the transport rings
until we know what's goin' on.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.560
Yeah.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.920
Boys.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.000
Let Hammond know we'll have something
in a couple of hours.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.440
- Jonas, stay with Teal'c.
- l don't understand.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.720
I´m sorry. Stay here.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.520
- I´m not going with you?
- Not this time.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.800
l've studied every report,
everything on Goa'uld...

05:02.880 --> 05:05.440
Because l gave you an order, Jonas.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.600
l always have a reason.
I´m not required to explain.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.160
lt's a military thing.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.240
Jack.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.040
- What is that?
- l can't make it out.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.440
The crew has abandoned ship.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.200
That's good news. We've all been
holding our breath down here.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.600
- That is most unwise.
- Yes, of course, Teal'c.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.880
Colonel O'Neill is determining
if the vessel can be salvaged.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.080
Very well.
Keep me apprised. Hammond out.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.960
This is strange.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.280
Before they left, they initiated
a self-destruct sequence.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.080
- The countdown's stuck.
- lt doesn't make any sense.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.800
lt can only be stopped
with a command override,

06:56.880 --> 07:00.640
but that would erase the sequence,
not suspend it halfway.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.680
ls the ship going to explode or not?

07:03.800 --> 07:09.360
Until we know why it was suspended,
we can't be sure it won't start up again.

07:09.440 --> 07:12.160
We need to do a diagnostic.

07:12.240 --> 07:17.680
Carter You and Davis, see if you can
disable that self-destruct altogether.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.000
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.960
Are you seriously considering
salvaging this ship?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.760
Why, yes, l am, Jacob.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.280
- This ship belonged to Anubis.
- Excellent

07:33.400 --> 07:35.760
What if it's a Trojan Horse?

07:36.760 --> 07:40.160
Then, apparently they did it wrong.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.800
Jack, none of this makes any sense,

07:42.880 --> 07:46.720
so before you slap a US Air Force sticker
on the side of this ship...

07:46.800 --> 07:48.480
Will you stop?

07:48.600 --> 07:52.560
We gotta check things out to see
what happened before we do anything.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.800
And find out why it's in Earth orbit.

07:54.880 --> 07:59.360
Our orders are to recover technology that
can help us defend against the Goa'uld.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.960
l'd say this ship falls under that heading,
wouldn't you?

08:03.040 --> 08:05.120
- OK.
- Thank you.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.360
Sometimes l worry that you're gonna
get my favourite planet wiped out.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.240
Yes. What planet is that?

08:15.160 --> 08:19.120
lf they wanted to scuttle this ship
and the self-destruct didn't work,

08:19.200 --> 08:23.680
their next logical option
would be to sabotage the hyperdrive.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.920
Friesen, let's go.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.080
l'll do a systems check from here.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.640
Find out what that sound is.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.760
What's the problem?

08:53.120 --> 08:56.000
- Dad, this is Sam.
- What's up?

08:56.120 --> 08:59.360
We're going to the computer core
but can't access this corridor.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.480
All right, hang on.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.840
The whole section's sealed off
and the life support's been shut down.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.160
- Why would they do that?
- l have no idea.

09:12.280 --> 09:16.080
l'll see if l can open it up
and get the ventilation going again.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.520
Colonel, we should also
check on the shield generators.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.160
- Jacob?
- How's the hyperdrive?

09:32.240 --> 09:36.320
Friesen says the engine checks out but
he wants to look at the shield generators.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.640
Does he say why?

09:39.440 --> 09:42.160
- Why? To see them.
- To see them?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.400
Never mind.

09:46.520 --> 09:52.080
lf this ship destroyed an Asgard ship,
then its shields were superior to any...

09:56.880 --> 09:59.760
- We're in.
- Just be careful, Sam.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.520
Yes, Dad.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.040
Whoa

10:19.920 --> 10:22.480
Something bad definitely happened here.

10:29.760 --> 10:34.880
Dad, we're outside the computer core.
The door's been hit by several staff blasts.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.200
lt's the only door l can't open.
The circuits are fused.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.400
lt's almost as if
there was a deliberate overload.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.040
lt looks more and more
like a saboteur on board.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.120
Someone damaged the computer and
sealed it off so it couldn't be repaired.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.640
Whatever happened,
l can't get you inside.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.120
- Colonel, have you been monitoring?
- Affirmative. On my way.

11:01.200 --> 11:06.480
l have to blow something up. Head back
to the peltak, see if Jacob needs any help.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.800
Shall we?

11:31.440 --> 11:34.320
- Whoo That was loud
- What?

11:42.880 --> 11:44.640
Jacob, we're in.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.000
This is fantastic.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.240
No. This is fantastic.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.080
Shield generators...

12:21.960 --> 12:23.440
Hello?

12:33.080 --> 12:35.440
Colonel O'Neill?

13:19.320 --> 13:23.120
Why would he bring me here if
I´m not allowed to contribute anything?

13:23.240 --> 13:24.960
This is your first mission.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.320
lt may take time for Colonel O'Neill
to gain confidence in you.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.120
- So it was the same for you?
- No, it was not.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.240
Oh...

13:37.680 --> 13:41.120
You know, l heard the rumour
that... l only got this assignment

13:41.200 --> 13:44.320
because Colonel O'Neill
didn't want a Russian on the team.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.480
Such rumours are meaningless.
O'Neill would not have chosen you

13:48.600 --> 13:53.360
if he did not believe that one day you
would be an effective member of SG-1 .

13:54.080 --> 13:57.200
Thanks, Teal'c.
l really appreciate that.

13:58.800 --> 14:04.160
Those of us who aren't originally from
Earth have got to stick together, right?

14:06.040 --> 14:09.360
Are you suggesting an alien conspiracy?

14:10.720 --> 14:12.080
No

14:14.880 --> 14:16.880
Oh

14:17.000 --> 14:21.200
Of course, yes. l was warned
about your occasional use of humour.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.520
You got me.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.520
No conspiracy.

14:40.840 --> 14:44.880
Computer log confirms that
this is the same ship Thor was aboard.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.840
And?

14:47.920 --> 14:50.160
lt could explain a lot, sir.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.200
Thor's brain was directly linked
to this computer.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.920
Anubis may have underestimated
the power of an Asgard's mind.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.640
And?

14:58.760 --> 15:03.760
lt's possible that Thor was able to rewrite
some of the ship's programming.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.640
Maybe even leave something behind.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.800
- Like a virus?
- Exactly.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.760
By interfering with
navigation, life support,

15:11.840 --> 15:14.880
a complex virus could have
made Anubis abandon ship.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.760
Might explain
why the self-destruct got stuck.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.000
He could've generated a new subroutine

15:20.080 --> 15:25.000
that sent this ship to our solar system
after it was abandoned, like a... gift.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.840
l know it sounds a little wacky, sir,

15:27.920 --> 15:32.320
but the more l think about it, the more
it seems like the best explanation.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.000
Wishful thinking.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.200
lf this ship wasn't intended for us to find,

15:37.320 --> 15:41.520
why did it travel halfway
across the galaxy all by itself?

15:41.640 --> 15:45.120
For that matter, why didn't
the self-destruct just go off?

15:45.240 --> 15:51.280
l doubt a virus will know the difference
between us and the Goa'uld.

15:51.840 --> 15:56.960
There has to be a way to disable it
or Thor wouldn't have sent the ship here.

15:57.080 --> 16:02.080
Dr Friesen, this is Major Carter. We could
use your assistance in the computer core.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.720
Friesen, come in.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.240
- Dad, have you seen Dr Friesen?
- Negative.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.720
You scientists Stay here. l'll find him.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.000
- lt's a big ship, sir.
- l think l know where he went.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.640
lt's comin' out of the ship's intercom.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.720
- What is?
- The sound we keep hearing.

16:36.840 --> 16:42.560
You hear that? There's a pattern to it.
Almost like distorted words.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.040
Let's check it out.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.520
Carter, l want you and Davis
back in the peltak with Jacob.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.240
- What's going on, sir?
- Friesen's dead.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.560
Jacob, come in.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.200
Jacob, do you read?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.560
Jacob, come in.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.600
Jacob?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.640
Dad

18:27.400 --> 18:29.800
Colonel, we've got another problem.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.080
l'll live. Go, go.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.520
We're decelerating out of orbit.
The drive controls are disabled.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.240
We've got no way of altering course.
We're gonna crash.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.480
Teal'c, come in.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.800
You are approaching Earth's atmosphere.

18:46.880 --> 18:51.680
You know, we noticed that.
You'll have to ring us outta here.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.800
Standing by.

19:29.440 --> 19:34.360
l estimate impact between 500
and 1 ,000 miles west-southwest of Alaska.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.840
The energy released will be massive.
There could be a tidal wave.

19:37.960 --> 19:41.320
Raise the shields and set
inertial dampening to maximum.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.800
That way the ship should
survive in one piece.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.000
Done. That's all l can do.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.120
Teal'c, we're heading to the ring room.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.360
Wait, wait, wait.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.600
Teal'c?

19:52.720 --> 19:56.400
We have been attacked by Jaffa
from the mothership.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.120
What's your situation?

20:01.240 --> 20:05.320
They are no longer a threat to us
but the ship has been damaged.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.800
The crystals that receive ring
transmissions were destroyed.

20:08.880 --> 20:13.200
There's insufficient time
to dock aboard the mothership.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.480
Well, l guess we're goin' in.

20:31.880 --> 20:37.680
The official line is that early this morning,
at 0800 hours, NORAD tracked a meteor.

20:37.760 --> 20:41.120
lt entered the Earth's atmosphere
and landed in the north Pacific.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.760
So far, no word
from the Chinese government,

20:43.840 --> 20:46.080
but I´m sure we'll hear from them soon.

20:46.160 --> 20:51.280
As for the Russians, l have a call going
through to Colonel Chekov in ten minutes.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.200
Yes, sir. l'll keep you apprised
of any further developments.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.240
Gentlemen, it's good to have you back.

20:58.360 --> 21:02.560
We've located the mothership.
Sonar readings suggest it's still intact.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.920
- Then they may still be alive?
- We're assuming so.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.360
There's a Deep Submergence
Rescue Vehicle en route,

21:09.480 --> 21:12.800
but we have to figure out how
the crew will access the mothership.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.320
lts escape pods are jettisoned
through pressurised tubes.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.320
Maybe one of them could be used
as a point of access.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.080
Sounds like our best shot.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.240
Teal'c and l would like to
join the rescue operation.

21:24.360 --> 21:27.440
- There's a plane waiting.
- Thank you, sir.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.200
l should've been with them.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.360
You believe
you could have prevented this?

21:43.440 --> 21:45.600
Maybe. You don't think so?

21:45.720 --> 21:49.320
lt was an ambush. Your presence
would have made little difference.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.520
Like on the cargo ship?

21:51.600 --> 21:53.680
You did not know Jaffa would ring aboard.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.960
l stood there. You saved my life
like Dr Jackson did on my planet.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.400
l didn't do a thing.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.320
lt is my understanding
that it was largely your idea

22:08.400 --> 22:12.560
that led to the disposal of the other
Stargate before it could be detonated.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.960
- You saved the lives of millions.
- That was an intellectual exercise.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.800
I´m talking about knowing what
you can do in the heat of the moment.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.000
One can never be certain
until the opportunity arises.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.280
Well, so far, my track record is not great.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.160
Perhaps that is so.

22:30.280 --> 22:35.120
But there are many battles
left to be fought, Jonas Quinn.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.680
How ya doin'?

22:55.760 --> 22:58.480
Aside from the burns,
l got a broken collarbone.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.960
Selmak's working on it.

23:02.840 --> 23:07.760
You know, for guys with no life signs,
those Jaffa did a bit of damage.

23:09.120 --> 23:13.440
They must have been trapped in
the section of the ship that was sealed off.

23:13.520 --> 23:17.200
To stay alive, they would have
gone into a deep state of kelno'reem,

23:17.280 --> 23:20.800
slowing down their heart rate
to one or two beats per minute.

23:20.880 --> 23:25.840
ln that condition, the cargo ship's sensors
weren't sensitive enough to pick 'em up.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.600
Think there are any more
running around?

23:29.720 --> 23:31.520
l doubt it.

23:31.600 --> 23:36.320
My guess is the three that attacked me
were on the computer-core level.

23:36.440 --> 23:40.120
l let 'em out when l opened the door
to allow Sam inside.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.760
We've got life support operating at 50%.

23:45.840 --> 23:51.440
Won't be too comfortable, but at least
we won't freeze to death... right away.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.080
- Can we fix the engines?
- Not a chance.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.240
And that's not our only problem.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.960
We found evidence of structural damage,
probably a result of the impact.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.600
- How bad?
- I´m not sure.

24:03.680 --> 24:07.360
The exterior pressure's pretty severe,
especially on the lower levels.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.600
lt could compromise the hull.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.920
Well, help will be on the way.

24:12.040 --> 24:16.160
There's also the self-destruct sequence
frozen halfway through its countdown.

24:16.240 --> 24:20.320
- You haven't turned that off yet?
- No, sir. I´m not sure we should even try.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.480
Why?

24:21.600 --> 24:24.400
First the door to the computer core
was locked.

24:24.480 --> 24:28.800
When the Jaffa tried to get in, the section
was sealed off and life support shut down.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.160
- By who?
- lt's ''whom''.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.240
Actually, sir, it's more like ''what''.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.960
- What?
- The virus Thor left behind.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.960
Exactly.
What if it was trying to defend itself?

24:41.040 --> 24:45.040
So Thor leaves behind a virus
that forces Anubis to abandon the ship,

24:45.120 --> 24:50.400
and this virus defends itself against the
Jaffa Anubis left behind to blow the ship?

24:50.520 --> 24:53.600
Or maybe it was left here
so we could find it.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.240
Sir, l'd like to return
to the computer core.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.320
l'll go with you.

25:01.560 --> 25:05.760
Sir, we just got word from the task force.
The DSRV is in the water.

25:15.440 --> 25:19.520
Major Davis is right. lt is definitely
coming through the ship's intercom.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.920
Maybe the virus is trying to talk to us.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.320
What the hey?

25:36.440 --> 25:38.560
Dad, we've got evidence of flooding here.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
Stand by.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.720
There's been a hull breach
on the engineering level.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.600
We're nowhere near engineering.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.160
Sea water penetrated to the access shaft,

26:02.280 --> 26:06.240
and now the pressure's pushing it
up through the core of the ship.

26:06.320 --> 26:10.880
- We're flooding from the inside.
- Dad, the door's closing behind us

26:10.960 --> 26:14.560
lt's a security measure.
All doors are sealed around the breach.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.280
l'll try to open it from here.

26:29.680 --> 26:33.600
- lt's a bit chilly.
- Dad, how's it coming with that door?

26:34.200 --> 26:36.800
This could take some time, Sam.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.040
We have visual contact.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.920
Sorry, sir,
l can't bypass the system locally.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.000
Jacob?

26:51.120 --> 26:54.480
l can't get access to the security program.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.840
- I´m goin' down there.
- The local controls are locked out.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.880
I´m gonna try to find
a back door to the program.

27:00.960 --> 27:05.120
How long's that gonna take?
I´m looking at major shrinkage here.

27:05.200 --> 27:09.520
l don't know. This is kind of a unique
situation. Give me a few minutes.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.000
How long will it take
for this thing to fill up?

27:14.120 --> 27:16.080
A few more minutes.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.440
Yep.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.920
Approaching point of entry.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.280
Next time we crash our brand-new
mothership, let's do it in the tropics.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.920
lt wouldn't make a difference.
At this depth all water is ice-cold.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.680
- Shallower water, then. Shallower.
- Yes, sir. l'll keep that in mind.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.920
Or we could just not crash at all.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.520
Be nice to keep our new mothership
more than a couple of hours.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.840
Yes, sir.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.520
- We could blow the door.
- No. The concussion would kill them.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.160
They'll be dead if we don't.
We have to do something

27:56.280 --> 27:58.720
What do you think
I´m trying to do, Major?

28:04.040 --> 28:06.720
Your dad's cuttin' it a little close

28:13.880 --> 28:15.840
l can't do it.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.440
Sam,

28:31.520 --> 28:33.520
I´m sorry.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.880
- What is that, Jacob?
- Security protocol's been erased.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.640
Jack, Sam, come in

29:04.760 --> 29:07.120
Jacob, this is Teal'c.
We are on board the ship.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.920
Jack and Sam are in trouble,
main computer level.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.040
- That's two levels down this way.
- Remain here.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.400
Dad, this is Sam. We're OK.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.000
Yes

29:24.120 --> 29:26.720
Thank God
Sam, you really had me worried.

29:26.840 --> 29:30.640
Tell him l take back everything
l was thinking while l was underwater.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.120
Whatever you did, it worked.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.480
The security protocol erased itself.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.280
- How is that possible?
- l don't know.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.600
Who cares? Let's go.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.240
O'Neill.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.880
Are you all right?

29:53.000 --> 29:57.280
A little wet, a little chilly.
The knee gets stiff in cold water.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.360
We have a rescue submarine docked.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.080
- We can't leave yet.
- Yes, we can.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.520
No, sir. Something else
is definitely going on here.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
Sir.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.360
A message from the task force. The DSRV
pilot reports they made contact.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.840
SG-1's OK, but Dr Friesen's dead.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.640
- Did they get them off the ship?
- Not yet.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.240
They're staying aboard for some reason.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.920
lt's definitely a voice.
l'll see if l can clean it up.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.800
- Why would it be so distorted?
- Anubis probably tried to shut it off.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.480
Carter?

30:40.560 --> 30:44.640
The security program that locked us in
that corridor didn't shut down by itself.

30:44.720 --> 30:48.640
You think this virus Thor left
in the computer is acting intelligently?

30:48.760 --> 30:52.640
lf that door hadn't opened,
Colonel O'Neill and l would have drowned.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.880
lt knows who you are.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.560
I got it.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.640
l am using the internal communication
system to synthesise my voice.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.800
l am using the internal communication
system to synthesise my voice.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.320
Thor spoke those words to O'Neill
and l when we were imprisoned here.

31:08.440 --> 31:13.200
Maybe what we've been calling a virus
isn't a virus at all. Maybe it's Thor.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.280
We got him off this ship months ago.

31:15.360 --> 31:19.120
Not before Anubis downloaded
his mind into the computer core.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.200
lf his consciousness remained intact,

31:21.280 --> 31:24.320
he would be an independent entity
operating within the system.

31:24.440 --> 31:27.760
- His mind took control of the vessel.
- Way to go, Thor.

31:27.880 --> 31:31.920
The Asgard said Thor was on life support
with little chance he'd come out of it.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.120
So?

31:33.240 --> 31:36.080
lf we can download his consciousness
from the computer,

31:36.200 --> 31:38.760
the Asgard can transfer it
into a new cloned body.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.200
lf that's what you wanna do, Sam,
move fast.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.920
The computer core isn't flooded yet,
but it will be.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.680
Wait. lf Thor is in control of this ship,
he's keeping the self-destruct on hold.

31:49.760 --> 31:53.440
We remove that consciousness,
the countdown will start up again.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.000
How long will we have
when the countdown resumes?

31:56.120 --> 31:58.400
Approximately 1 7 minutes.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.440
Plenty of time to get out of here
after we've got Thor.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.360
l know Thor was a friend of yours,
but this is a Goa'uld mothership.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.240
lf we allow it to blow up,
there'll be nothing to salvage.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.960
Jack, this ship is never gonna fly again.

32:11.040 --> 32:15.440
Having the supreme commander of
the Asgard owe you one is more valuable.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.640
Yeah. All right.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.360
Next mothership we keep, OK?

32:26.560 --> 32:29.600
Jonas, take Davis and Jacob
back to the sub. Wait there.

32:29.720 --> 32:32.560
- Colonel, l'd like to assist Major Carter...
- Jonas.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.280
- l'll take them back to the sub.
- Thank you.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.760
Here he is.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.760
You sure you got all of him in there?
He's a smart guy, you know.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.960
- The self-destruct has been reactivated.
- Let's go.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.040
This door should not be closed.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.200
Dang.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.600
Corridor must've flooded.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.880
- Jacob?
- Yeah, what's goin' on?

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Our exit is blocked.
We need another way around.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.840
All the other passageways
into that section were already flooded.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.320
There is no other way around/

33:58.240 --> 34:00.560
l'll go back to the peltak,
see what l can do.

34:00.680 --> 34:04.880
Negative. Get that sub to a safe distance.
We'll think of somethin'.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.640
Understood.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.280
l got nothing. How are you doin'?

34:17.400 --> 34:21.760
- There's only one other way off this level.
- The glider bays.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.280
We can do that?

34:24.400 --> 34:26.840
l've no idea.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.800
OK.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.199
The ship's self-destruct is activated.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.120
We need to get the DSRV
as far away as possible.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.800
Jack, we're at the sub.
What's your status?

34:47.159 --> 34:51.360
Here's our plan, Jacob.
We're gonna take a couple of gliders.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.639
A glider isn't designed
to operate underwater.

34:55.719 --> 35:00.240
- lt's our only shot.
- All right, all right.

35:00.320 --> 35:04.960
You'll have to activate the compartment's
force field to stop the flooding.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.640
Those systems went offline
after the crash.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.960
l know. I´m trying to reroute
the power from here.

35:15.720 --> 35:16.680
What is it?

35:16.800 --> 35:21.520
The force fields allow ships in and out
without depressurising the compartment.

35:21.600 --> 35:26.120
lf she can't get it online, she can't open
the doors without flooding the hangar.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.640
Right.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.960
Sam?

35:31.080 --> 35:35.760
Jacob, l want you to get that sub
to a minimum safe distance.

35:35.880 --> 35:40.320
- Understood. Let's go.
- There's a control panel on this deck.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.880
- l can reroute the power.
- How do you know?

35:43.000 --> 35:46.360
l've gone over mothership schematics
a dozen times. I´m quick.

35:46.440 --> 35:49.640
- Yeah? Well, where is it?
- Don't wait for me.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.680
Jonas

36:06.120 --> 36:09.280
No pressure, Carter. Plenty of time.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.360
On the contrary, O'Neill.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.480
Lots and lots of time.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.560
Yes, sir.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.280
Jack?

36:19.360 --> 36:22.120
Jacob, will you please get outta here?

36:22.240 --> 36:27.360
We are, but Jonas went off to try to get
the force field online from a relay panel.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.840
Listen... good luck.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.640
What'd he say?

37:02.760 --> 37:06.400
We are being advised that in seven
minutes the ship will be destroyed.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.760
Ah. See? Plenty of time.

37:09.880 --> 37:14.880
This isn't tied into the primary system.
l can't reroute the power from here.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.280
The force field just came online.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.680
- Nice
- lt wasn't me.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.560
Jonas.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.640
OK.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.600
Wait Wait

39:07.840 --> 39:10.800
- Did it work?
- We're about to find out.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.600
Powering engines.

39:29.080 --> 39:34.240
- Listen, if we don't survive this, thanks.
- You're welcome.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.640
Opening glider-bay doors.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.920
Nice.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.320
Hang on.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.760
Whoa

40:27.000 --> 40:29.440
- Everybody all right?
- Yes, sir. We're fine.
