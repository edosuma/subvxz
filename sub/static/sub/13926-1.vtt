02:42.296 --> 02:44.131
Woman's voice:
He's behind you.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.203
- Behind you.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.016
Sorry.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.852
Hang on, hang on,
hang on.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.255
Girl: Why do you have
your panties in a twist?

03:07.288 --> 03:10.023
- I was in the library.
- ( scoffs ) What for?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.826
What are you so happy about?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.895
Well, me and Rose are staying
at Kaitlan's this weekend.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.432
What, are you 13?

03:18.466 --> 03:19.933
You're that excited
about a slumber party?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.869
Kaitlan's mom is gonna
be out of town.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.437
Some business trip
or whatever.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.038
Your parents
are okay with that?

03:25.072 --> 03:27.575
Mm, they don't know.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.377
Nice.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.881
So if you're not doing anything,
come over.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.183
And bring Jeff.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.686
Okay. Okay.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.389
- Why Jeff?
- Rose is asking.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.491
Got to go.

03:48.128 --> 03:50.298
Ahem. Jeff.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.665
It's Shane.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.901
Listen, buddy, I think I know
what you're gonna be doing
tonight.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.871
I mean, sometimes they come
as early as 7:00,

03:57.905 --> 04:00.173
so just put the trash bins out
on Sunday night.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.943
My plane's scheduled
to arrive at 10:15.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.945
I'll shoot you a text
as soon as I'm there.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.380
- Okay, cool.
- Okay? All right.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.319
Oh, and I know
I don't need to say it,

04:11.352 --> 04:13.987
but no boys, no parties.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.823
- Okay?
- Of course, Mom.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.224
Baby, just remember
who you are, okay?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.526
Okay.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.928
The emergency credit card
is behind the coffee and the
tea.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.696
It's emergencies only, okay?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.998
Oh, and here you go.
Wait, this is for you.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.600
- Okay?
- Thanks. Okay.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.936
Oh, your friends, Jenna
and what's her name again?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.304
- Rose.
- Rose.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.139
If they want to come over,
that's fine, but...

04:32.172 --> 04:35.075
- No boys. All right.
- Good job.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.610
- I love you.
- I love you.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.979
Have a safe trip.
You look really pretty.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.448
Thank you, baby.
I love you.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.082
I love you, too.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.418
Thank you, sir.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.289
Be good, hon.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.327
Bye, Mom.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.569
- Stop.
- What?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.571
The cab's barely
around the corner.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.808
So is Shane
gonna come over?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.743
You mean with Jeff?

05:11.078 --> 05:12.380
Come on, let's go.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.254
Hey, guys.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.293
- Whoa.
- What?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.995
Rose:
Nice house.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.797
Kaitlan: Yeah, my mom's got
a good job.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.699
Jenna: All right, snap out
of it, sunshine.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.701
- Kaitlan: You guys hungry?
- Yes.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.169
I am starving. We should order
some pizza or something.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.472
Rose: Pizza sounds great.
I'm down.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.891
Jenna:
Okay, thanks.

05:57.925 --> 06:01.361
Done, one cheese,
one pepperoni, 30 minutes.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.732
Kaitlan:
This is just another bathroom,

06:04.765 --> 06:06.434
but we're not supposed to use it
because of the plumbing.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.502
All right.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.470
My dad says
college is a waste of time.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.905
- God, you're so lucky.
- Why?

06:44.938 --> 06:48.041
My mom thinks that college
is like the end all, be all.
Whatever.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.544
She just got offered a track
scholarship to Trinity.

06:50.578 --> 06:51.679
Oh, yeah, that's right, you run.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.214
That's right.
I'm so over it.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.685
Oh, pizza.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.520
Do you have some money
to throw in for the pizza?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.655
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.625
Awesome.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.461
- Yay.
- Sweet, pizza.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.129
Smells good.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.499
Oh, I'm so hungry.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.133
All right, I'm gonna
put it here.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.735
- Oh!

07:25.078 --> 07:27.047
I swear sometimes I just--

07:27.080 --> 07:28.415
I want to, like,
join the Peace Corps

07:28.448 --> 07:30.017
or, like, move to Mumbai
or something.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.020
Wait, where is Mumbai?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.088
It's really far away from here.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.191
Hey, where's your mom's
liquor cabinet?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.993
Jenna, no, okay?

07:40.027 --> 07:43.631
Like, if my mom even notices,
I'm gonna be in college till I'm
70.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.267
Shut the fuck up.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.670
- What?
- Can you turn that down?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.705
- What's wrong?

07:51.739 --> 07:54.374
- Listen.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.777
- Kaitlan: But--
- Shh!

08:00.313 --> 08:01.782
Kaitlan:
Oh, shit.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.342
- I almost had a heart attack.
- Whatever.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.679
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present refreshments.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.346
- Why, thank you very much.
- Is that beer?

08:33.380 --> 08:36.216
No, it's fucking ginger ale.
Yeah, it's beer.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.951
Come on.

08:37.985 --> 08:41.121
Look, Jenna, this is not okay,
okay?
My mom is gonna kill me.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.990
Like, literally kill me.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.558
You weren't supposed
to tell anyone.

08:44.592 --> 08:47.260
Well, let's just have some fun.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.429
Jeff: Here, put this in the
fridge.
Yeah? Please? I'll love you
forever.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.567
See, I always thought of myself
as more the Clark Gable type.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.736
- Kaitlan: Shit.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.072
Guys, guys.
Guys, my mom is calling.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.208
- Shut up, okay?
- All right, relax.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.510
- Please be quiet.
- Ooh!

09:03.543 --> 09:05.846
Shh!

09:05.879 --> 09:07.547
Hey, Mom.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.449
Oh, nothing.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.984
I'm just watching TV right now.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.820
I'm thinking about
going to bed early.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.824
Uh, no, actually.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.225
Jenna couldn't
come over tonight.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.727
I think she's gonna
end up coming--

09:19.760 --> 09:23.296
um, over tomorrow.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.398
Mm-hmm.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.869
- Yes.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.403
All righty, Mom.
I love you.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.107
Okay.
I love you, too.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.976
Bye.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.511
My God.

09:38.545 --> 09:41.114
Mom phone call, over.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.549
- Cheers.
- All right, all right.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.017
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.854
To Mom being
out of town.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.030
Shane:
And they go upstairs.

09:57.064 --> 10:00.968
And there's this girl.
She's just freaking out on the
floor.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.803
On the floor.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.537
It was creepy.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.007
I've seen that video.
It's a hoax. It's definitely a
hoax.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.376
- We all know it's a hoax.
- What's it called?

10:09.409 --> 10:11.544
"The Midnight Game."

10:11.578 --> 10:13.280
Why would anybody play that?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.083
For fun.
It's a pagan ritual.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.551
It's designed to teach you
how to follow the rules.

10:18.585 --> 10:22.122
If you don't follow the rules,
then you get punished.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.860
So, wait. If you
don't relight your candle and--

10:26.894 --> 10:28.428
what's the other thing?

10:28.461 --> 10:32.165
Right, or surround yourself
in a circle of salt.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.535
If you don't do those things,
then you'll hallucinate.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.707
Cool.
Like an acid trip?

10:39.740 --> 10:44.111
Yeah, no, it's more like
you hallucinate your worst
fears.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.813
Jenna: Oh.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.815
Only until 3:33 A.M.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.050
And then what?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.685
I don't know. You go home.
You go to bed.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.953
You take a crap.
Whatever.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.422
So basically I just feel like
I'm falling for a couple hours?

10:55.455 --> 10:56.556
What?

10:56.589 --> 10:58.225
Well, I mean,
it's your worst fears, right?

10:58.258 --> 11:01.394
And I've kind of always had
this phobia about heights.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.797
Like, my mom tried to take me
to the Grand Canyon once

11:03.831 --> 11:05.265
and I, like, couldn't even
get near the edge.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.434
It was horrible.
The whole trip really sucked.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.603
Guess I'd be seeing
ghosts all night.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.372
Ghosts? Really?

11:12.405 --> 11:15.175
Rose: I saw one once
when I was 10.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.612
I was staying at my
grandmother's
in upstate New York.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.948
Your house kind of
reminds me of hers.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.850
So old and moldy?

11:24.718 --> 11:27.220
No, I just kept hearing
footsteps every night.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.922
And I thought it was, like,
my parents or something.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.058
But, well, then I got up

11:31.091 --> 11:33.560
and I saw this old guy
walking down the stairs.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.062
You mean your grandfather?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.164
Rose:
No, he died two years before.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.099
But it wasn't his ghost.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.768
No, I found out
the original owner,

11:40.801 --> 11:44.037
he, like, killed himself
or something in 1915.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.007
I think it was him.
It freaked me the fuck out.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.847
What about you?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.618
You mean,
like what am I afraid of?

11:58.651 --> 12:00.854
Um...

12:00.888 --> 12:02.890
hmm.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.658
I don't know, really.

12:05.692 --> 12:06.960
Going insane.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.829
Jeff: Fuck, no.
I'm not-- no.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.431
I'm not insane and I don't
plan on going insane, so...

12:11.464 --> 12:14.001
No, I mean
that's my worst fear.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.603
You should probably change it
'cause you kind of already are.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.571
- Shane: Yeah. Bitch.

12:20.207 --> 12:24.744
My aunt just flipped out
a few years ago.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.380
They institutionalized her.

12:27.414 --> 12:31.018
I guess she thought everyone
was out to kill her or
something.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.086
Claustrophobia for me.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.888
Probably. Definitely.
Yeah, claustrophobia.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.356
I hate small spaces.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.225
Like, if I got stuck in
an elevator or something,

12:38.258 --> 12:39.592
I'd go batshit crazy.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.295
Like, fucking climb
the elevator shaft or something.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.864
It's 'cause you're so big.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.800
- Not like that.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.737
- He's got a big shaft.
- Wow.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.809
- So what about you?
- Shane: Me?

12:55.843 --> 12:58.846
- Yeah, you.
- I--

12:58.879 --> 13:01.748
Me? I don't know.
I'd have to think about it.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.550
I'd have to think about it.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.953
Jeff: Because you're just so
tough,
you have no fears, is that it?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.454
No, asshole, that's not
what I'm saying.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.990
- Not one fear for Shane?
- I'm just saying, I'd have--

13:11.124 --> 13:14.227
I think he's just a little
embarrassed
to tell us what it is.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.729
Yeah, that's what it is, I'm
just
embarrassed to tell you what it
is.

13:16.763 --> 13:20.333
All right. All right.
I've got to go.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.302
- You're not gonna play the
game?
- It's 11:30.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.604
Yeah, I know. That's perfect.
We got just enough time to set
up.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.639
I got practice tomorrow at
10:30.
I told you.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.141
Shane:
Okay, we'll be in bed by 4:00.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.742
Tell that to my parents, dude.

13:29.776 --> 13:33.346
All right, just tell your
parents
that you're staying at my place.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.415
Come on, what do you say?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.550
Guys, I don't know about this.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.419
Yeah, I'm kind of scared.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.389
Isn't that the whole point?

13:42.422 --> 13:44.524
What do we need?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.860
Gather round, Girl Scouts,

13:46.894 --> 13:50.130
'cause when are you ever gonna
have another opportunity like
this?

14:15.788 --> 14:18.458
Does anybody have a pin?
You know, like a needle.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.760
- Does it matter if it's kosher?
- Shane: I'm sure that's fine.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.596
- Pin!
- Rose: Yeah, I got it. Hold on.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.365
Okay, what is this for?

14:25.398 --> 14:29.236
Okay, so after we write our
names
on the pieces of paper, we...

14:29.269 --> 14:32.505
( laughs ) ...we add
a drop of our own blood.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.641
- What? No. No fucking way.
- That is really gross.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.010
That's the rules.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.846
- Ah.
- Shane: Okay.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.653
- Jenna: Such a pyro.
- Shut up.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.989
All right, check it out.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.890
Like a man.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.494
Kaitlan: Gross.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.097
- Who's next?
- Mmm...

14:57.130 --> 14:59.199
Come on,
we've got five minutes.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.801
- All right, fine.
- Do we have to do it?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.471
- Ugh.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.373
Shane: Kaitlan, your front door
is made out of wood, right?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.275
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.550
Shane: Kaitlan, hurry.
Close the door.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.720
- Okay.
- Jeff: All right, now what?

15:53.753 --> 15:56.856
Shane: Now we put our pieces
of paper down here.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.259
Jenna: Okay.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.261
Shane:
Now we light our candles.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.164
- Jeff, what time is it?
- 11:59.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.799
Great. Everyone bring
your candles here.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.801
Jenna!

16:08.835 --> 16:11.138
- You have to use a match.
- Oh, please.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.508
Jeff, time.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.679
11:59 and 34...
35 seconds.

16:19.712 --> 16:23.083
Perfect. Okay. Now, I'm gonna
knock
22 times on the door.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.253
And on the 22nd time,
it has to be midnight exactly.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.221
- Jeff: All right.
- Yeah?

16:28.255 --> 16:29.589
- Go now.
- Okay.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.425
- All: One, two, three, four,

16:32.459 --> 16:36.829
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10,

16:36.863 --> 16:40.067
11, 12, 13, 14,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.869
15, 16, 17, 18,

16:42.902 --> 16:45.705
19, 20, 21, 22.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.874
Holy shit, that was perfect.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.276
Now what?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.844
Now we blow out our candles
and we go inside.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.626
We just summoned
the Midnight Man.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.661
- Jeff: Get inside.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.797
Jenna:
Mwa-ha-ha.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.068
Shane:
All right.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.438
Now we light
our candles again.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.107
Jenna:
Okay.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.808
Jeff: What the fuck
is the Midnight Man anyway?

17:23.410 --> 17:25.412
Kaitlan: Yeah, you didn't say
anything about that.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.012
Rose: Yeah, who is
the Midnight Man?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.948
Shane: Oh, I didn't?

17:28.981 --> 17:31.017
Well, that's the whole point.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.253
The Midnight Man is the guy

17:33.286 --> 17:35.988
that haunts you
with your own worst fears.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.225
Jenna:
Ooh, creepy.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.526
Shane:
Yeah, well, only if he gets you.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.028
Well, how does he catch you?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.063
All right, listen up.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.699
From here on out,
we go with just the candles.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.368
Now, if your candle goes out,

17:48.401 --> 17:49.969
that means the Midnight Man's
found you.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.504
Shit.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.673
You then have 10 seconds
to relight your candle.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.443
Now, if you don't relight
your candle in 10 seconds,

17:56.476 --> 17:58.245
that's where the salt comes in.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.046
How?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.014
You surround yourself
in a circle of salt

18:02.048 --> 18:03.916
and you stay inside
until 3:33 A.M.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.618
What if you don't?

18:05.652 --> 18:08.221
That's when the Midnight Man
fucks your head to pieces.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.357
Okay, I am getting
more matches.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.159
Hell, yeah. Me, too.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.727
- I fucking love this game.
- Right, man?

18:26.339 --> 18:29.976
I'm putting a big old circle
of salt around my ass.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.811
Is there any rules
about drinking or what?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.580
- No.
- Sweet.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.548
- Who wants a beer?
- Shane: Hit me.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.550
- You've been hit. Anybody?
- I'm good.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.255
Hey, you want to go
explore upstairs?

18:42.289 --> 18:44.291
Sure, why not?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.029
What?

18:50.062 --> 18:51.698
Nothing.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.466
What?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.649
- Come here.
- What?

19:09.682 --> 19:12.051
- Come here.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.459
That door always does that.
It's so drafty up there.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.630
Shane:
Well, what is up there?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.566
Nothing, really.
It's just an attic.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.135
I don't know, I don't really
like
going up there much.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.504
My dad used to sleep up there
when
my parents were getting a
divorce,

19:31.538 --> 19:34.006
so there's just, like, a lot
of bad energy up there.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.687
Hey, so can we please

19:47.720 --> 19:49.389
power up the microwave
for, like, three minutes?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.524
I'm really craving
some popcorn.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.826
I'm not going
to break the rules.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.428
Stop.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.266
Ooh, hello there.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.933
Hey, guys.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.104
Whatcha doing down there?

20:05.137 --> 20:07.240
Sorry to interrupt.

20:19.352 --> 20:22.021
There's no way I'm holding
this thing all night.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.392
Honestly, this is getting
kind of old.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.826
What time is it?

20:26.859 --> 20:29.962
It is 1:20 A.M.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.633
Great, only another two hours
and 13 minutes to go.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.168
Have you ever actually
done this before?

20:36.202 --> 20:37.704
No.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.306
Some cousins
told me about it.

20:39.339 --> 20:42.074
And some friends of theirs,
they did it last summer.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.843
Kaitlan: And?

20:43.876 --> 20:45.545
Well, apparently they all
came out alive.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.547
Oh, that's a relief.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.482
Yeah, but some freaky shit
did happen.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.117
Like what?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.919
Oh, my God.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.921
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Guys, come on, hurry up.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.424
Guys, hurry up.
Come on, please.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.426
Shit, I just dropped
all the matches.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.228
- Jeff: Three, two, one, ah.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.030
Okay, you said 10 seconds.
Was that more than 10 seconds?

21:04.063 --> 21:05.698
- That was under 10 seconds.
- Jeff?

21:05.732 --> 21:08.234
Um, okay, it was like
nine and a half seconds.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.703
- We're all good.
- God, that was so freaky.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.306
- You didn't blow on it, did
you?
- No.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.074
Rose: Well, maybe there was
a breeze or something

21:15.107 --> 21:16.476
when Jeff reached for his beer.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.045
- Holding my beer.
- It was the Midnight Man.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.079
- Shh.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.348
Guys.
Everybody shut up.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.249
- What? What is it?
- Shh!

21:24.851 --> 21:26.653
Upstairs.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.088
I heard something.

21:31.758 --> 21:35.094
Well, this house is old.
I mean, it does creak a lot.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.197
- It creaks like that?

21:38.230 --> 21:40.500
Jeff:
What the fuck was that?

21:40.533 --> 21:41.868
Kaitlan:
Okay, this is really weird.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.337
- Can we turn the lights back
on?
- No. No.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.606
Jeff, you and I,
we are going to go upstairs

21:46.639 --> 21:48.808
and we are going
to investigate this.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.943
You girls stay right here.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.413
Jeff: We will beat the Midnight
Man's ass for you girls, okay?

21:53.446 --> 21:55.047
Kaitlan: Guys, seriously,
don't fuck anything up.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.316
- My mom is gonna kill me.
- Okay.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.018
Jenna:
What do you think that was?

22:06.025 --> 22:07.994
- You swear you didn't blow it
out?
- I swear.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.029
Shit.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.699
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.402
- Which way?
- It's this way.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.552
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.086
What was that?

22:34.120 --> 22:35.522
You didn't fucking see that?

22:35.555 --> 22:36.756
No, I saw it.
What was it?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.691
Shut the fuck up.
Come on.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.794
What are you doing?

22:41.828 --> 22:43.229
There's probably someone
in the fucking room.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.997
Yeah, it came from
the fucking end of the hall.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.468
Kaitlan, what's in the room
at the end of the hall?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.102
Kaitlan:
It's just a guest bedroom.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.405
- Jenna: You guys see anything?
- Not-- not yet.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.807
- I'm going downstairs.
- No, let's fucking check it
out.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.544
- I'm going downstairs.
- Fuck. Shh, come here.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.329
What the fuck?

23:17.363 --> 23:19.398
- Shit.
- Do you have matches?

23:19.432 --> 23:20.800
Yes, I have matches.
You don't have matches?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.368
No, I don't have matches.
Just light it, please.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.036
What the fuck did I tell you
about matches?

23:24.070 --> 23:26.005
Six, seven, eight, nine,

23:26.038 --> 23:28.908
- 10, 11, 12.
- Will you stop counting?

23:31.010 --> 23:34.346
Dude, that was way more
than 10 seconds.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.015
Fuck it.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.284
I won't tell if you won't.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.136
Oh, shit.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.910
Jeff:
Oh, what the fuck?

24:03.943 --> 24:05.411
Dude.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.446
Shane.

24:12.752 --> 24:16.055
- You don't think...

24:16.088 --> 24:18.257
that was just moved, do you?

24:19.492 --> 24:21.494
The footsteps.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.962
No.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.698
Then why is that off...

24:28.801 --> 24:30.670
Shit. Jenna!

24:30.703 --> 24:33.239
Hey, make sure your candle
doesn't go out.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.211
Shane:
What is it?

24:41.013 --> 24:42.782
Guys, there was
somebody outside.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.517
He, like, stopped
and looked in.

24:44.551 --> 24:45.952
- What did he look like?
- We couldn't see.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.754
It was a dark shadow.
I have no idea.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.989
- You still think this is
boring?
- Fuck you, asshole.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.257
I'm done with this.
I'm turning the lights on.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.925
Stop!

24:52.959 --> 24:55.562
You can't.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.130
Says who?

24:58.164 --> 24:59.632
Oh, my God.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.100
You know what?
Okay, I'm done.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.135
I'm done with this.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.240
- Did you unplug this?
- No.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.742
Maybe the bulb's out.

25:09.776 --> 25:12.178
( gasps ) Oh, my God! Oh, my
God!
Please, someone relight--

25:12.211 --> 25:13.713
Rose, there's nothing
wrong, okay?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.447
There's no boogeyman that's
gonna jump out and hurt you.

25:15.481 --> 25:18.417
Listen to me,
the rules are strict.

25:18.450 --> 25:21.588
All right, clearly
some weird shit is happening.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.890
You guys are not gonna believe
what Jeff and I found upstairs.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.391
What did you find?

25:25.424 --> 25:28.160
Nothing.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.962
No, what did you find?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.832
- Yeah, I was just kidding.
- Seriously?

25:39.706 --> 25:41.608
The power's out.

25:41.641 --> 25:44.677
Um, I don't think so.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.546
Jeff: Guys, it probably
has batteries. Come on.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.921
- I think I just saw him again.
- Oh, my God.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.765
Come on, motherfucker!
You want some of this?

26:05.798 --> 26:08.067
- Dude, fucking look for him.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.969
It's just funny.
You're yelling.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.805
Shane:
Do you see anything?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.575
No. Let's go inside.
Come on.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.745
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
- Dude, fucking what?

26:18.778 --> 26:21.614
Hey, how weird
was that cross?

26:21.648 --> 26:23.115
Don't talk about it, all right?

26:23.149 --> 26:24.583
I'm Catholic.
That shit freaks me out.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.620
- Yeah, it's just weird, right?
- No shit, it's weird.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.455
Fuck. This idea, bro,

26:29.488 --> 26:31.023
I really think you've outdone
yourself with this one.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.358
I thought it'd be fun.

26:32.391 --> 26:35.361
I thought we'd get the girls
a little excited and horny.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.830
- Yeah, me, too.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.732
Hey, shh.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.834
- Shh. Did you hear that?
- Shut up.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.703
No.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.738
- Kaitlan: Did you hear that?

26:45.772 --> 26:48.007
I think I heard it
from the woods.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.045
Maybe we should
just go back inside.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.247
- Come on.
- I'm going inside.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.049
Hey, but--

26:57.083 --> 26:58.951
Pussy.

27:11.597 --> 27:12.965
- Lock it.
- Yeah.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.000
Lock the deadbolt.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.903
Got it.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.454
What do you think
was out there?

27:35.487 --> 27:36.956
It's probably just a coyote.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.791
There's no way that was
a freaking coyote.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.160
Or like a pack of coyotes.
Maybe they hunt at night.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.628
Right?

27:44.731 --> 27:46.432
My cell's dead.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.103
You guys, I'm sorry.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.940
I had no idea.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.942
Come on, I heard about
this thing online.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.710
And my cousin
told me about it.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.579
Honestly,
I thought it'd be fun.

28:00.612 --> 28:03.082
I didn't think anything
would actually happen.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.584
What did you find upstairs?

29:46.485 --> 29:48.287
You guys, it's over.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.222
- We made it.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.624
Oh, God.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.127
That was so freaky.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.563
Shane, you're an asshole.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.699
Yeah, but a loveable one, right?

30:00.732 --> 30:02.634
- I don't know anymore.

30:02.668 --> 30:05.171
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.275
Why the fuck did we
do that anyway?

30:09.308 --> 30:12.678
I'm sorry.
Did we not all survive?

30:12.711 --> 30:15.114
I mean, I apologize
if anyone got too scared.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.784
But, you know, personally,
that was kind of fun.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.688
Whatever, you guys.
I'm going to bed.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.656
You can crash here
if you want.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.292
I'm coming with you.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.494
And, Shane, you can
sleep on the couch.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.363
- Will you stay with me, please?
- Yeah, definitely.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.233
What did you guys
find in here?

31:07.266 --> 31:09.535
Nothing.
Just a shadow.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.746
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.

31:20.779 --> 31:22.348
- What?
- I'm tired.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.116
You're tired?
Why are you tired?

31:24.150 --> 31:26.318
Because I've been up
all fucking night.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.048
Hey.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.948
- Shane: Hi, Rose.
- Morning.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.017
- Kaitlan: Hey, good morning.
- Rose: Morning.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.952
About time.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.888
- Um, where's Jeff?
- I thought he was with you.

33:09.921 --> 33:12.424
Shane: Oh, he had basketball
practice this morning. He left.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.526
Didn't he come
in the car with you?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.562
Yeah, but, I mean,
it's only three miles.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.764
Knowing him, he probably jogged.
I'll text him.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.799
Ow! Fuck.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.902
- Kaitlan: What's wrong?
- Jenna: Shit.

33:23.935 --> 33:26.605
- Hold it up.
- Do you have Band-Aids?

33:26.638 --> 33:28.707
Yeah, I do, actually.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.911
- Here.
- Okay.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.281
- Here, let me see it.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.216
Just give me
the damn Band-Aids!

33:37.249 --> 33:39.318
Okay.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.925
I hope you like
your tomatoes bloody.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.163
Well, the eggs are ready.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.299
Okay, where are your forks?

33:53.332 --> 33:55.934
- Bitch.
- Ow, what did I do?

33:55.967 --> 33:58.937
"What did I do?"
Little Miss Perfect.

33:58.970 --> 34:02.040
You've been copying me
since I was 10 and I'm so over
it.

34:02.074 --> 34:04.143
Okay, Jenna, maybe we should
just take a nap.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.911
Fuck you!

34:05.944 --> 34:08.013
You like Shane,
but you couldn't have him,

34:08.045 --> 34:09.947
so you went for his best friend.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.551
Have you ever even been
to a basketball game?

34:12.583 --> 34:13.885
Of course I have.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.388
And stop trying to act like
Kaitlan's fucking best friend!

34:16.422 --> 34:18.857
- Kaitlan: Okay, Jenna, calm
down.
- Okay, Jenna, I love you.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.391
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.463
- Jenna! Jenna!

34:24.496 --> 34:26.732
Shane: What the fuck
is wrong with you?

34:26.764 --> 34:28.500
I...

34:50.255 --> 34:51.922
Rose.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.728
I didn't mean
any of the things I said.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.501
Ever since I woke up
this morning,

35:02.534 --> 35:04.770
I've just been...

35:09.074 --> 35:10.776
It's fine.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.181
Um...

35:16.382 --> 35:18.517
it's a beautiful day out

35:18.550 --> 35:20.552
if anybody wants
to go hiking with me.

35:20.586 --> 35:23.622
I'd kind of really like
to get out of the house.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.825
Um, I mean,
you guys should go,

35:26.858 --> 35:29.361
but I kind of want to take a
nap.
Is that okay?

35:29.395 --> 35:31.197
Absolutely.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.432
Um...

35:33.465 --> 35:35.467
I think I'm gonna go
change my shoes.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.104
Yeah, me, too.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.680
Are you sure
you don't want to go out?

35:48.714 --> 35:50.649
Yeah.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.751
I'm just kind of tired.
But you should go.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.621
Okay.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.986
You should kick her backpack.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.648
Jenna:
It's natural.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.183
Hey, why don't you take a hit?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.652
It'll slow you down
so we can catch up.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.492
Cunt.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.095
Yeah, let's just catch up, huh?

37:14.833 --> 37:17.336
Why is everybody
in such a hurry?

37:58.276 --> 38:00.145
Hello?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.248
Kaitlan?

38:06.051 --> 38:08.219
Jenna?

38:08.253 --> 38:10.221
Shane?

38:20.165 --> 38:22.568
This isn't funny, Shane.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.174
Kaitlan? Shane?

39:45.083 --> 39:46.818
Jenna:
How far have we hiked?

39:46.852 --> 39:48.887
Only a couple miles.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.223
Who's that?

39:52.257 --> 39:53.959
It's my brother.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.127
I'll bet.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.163
What is that
supposed to mean?

39:58.196 --> 40:00.466
You know what?
You've always been texting,
texting.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.602
I never ask who it is.
But you've been getting a lot
lately.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.170
Are you seeing
somebody else?

40:08.106 --> 40:09.775
Show me!

40:09.808 --> 40:12.010
Yeah, I don't have
to show you shit.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.646
Who are you fucking?
That little whore Emily?

40:14.680 --> 40:17.348
She really likes
football players.

40:17.382 --> 40:19.350
Rumor has it
she's fucked them all.

40:19.384 --> 40:21.587
Emily Mason?

40:21.620 --> 40:23.755
Little Miss Cheerleader.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.924
Really good at doing splits.

40:26.925 --> 40:30.361
Well, I mean, I don't know her,
but I've always heard she's
nice.

40:30.395 --> 40:33.732
She is.
To football players.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.334
That's really insane, Jenna.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.504
We should probably go.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.573
Yeah.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.981
Sorry.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.053
Let's go, crackadoodle.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.370
Hmm.
Looks like a clown.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.183
The cloud.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.556
Come on, we're going.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.090
Right.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.694
Kaitlan: Is this the path
we came in on?

43:25.003 --> 43:26.905
Shit!

43:30.742 --> 43:32.510
Jenna:
Whoa, cool.

43:32.543 --> 43:34.579
That'd definitely
break your neck.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.515
That's not funny.
Come on, I'll walk next to you.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.317
Okay.

43:44.389 --> 43:46.424
You okay?
Okay.

43:52.263 --> 43:54.499
- Watch your step there.
- Okay.

43:56.868 --> 43:58.503
Hang on.

43:58.536 --> 44:00.739
I got a text from Rose.

44:00.772 --> 44:03.308
It just says help.

44:03.341 --> 44:05.110
Call her.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.781
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

44:09.815 --> 44:12.217
Nothing.

44:14.019 --> 44:15.586
Let's go.

44:47.252 --> 44:49.955
- Rose!
- Rose, where are you?

44:55.761 --> 44:58.163
Shane:
What happened?

44:58.196 --> 45:01.833
I saw him.

45:01.867 --> 45:05.003
- Who?
- The-- the thing.

45:07.906 --> 45:09.507
The Midnight Man.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.242
No way.

45:12.778 --> 45:14.579
Where'd you see him?

45:14.612 --> 45:16.681
He was--
he was upstairs

45:16.714 --> 45:19.184
in the room that I was in.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.787
Rose, give me the knife.

45:24.122 --> 45:26.057
Rose, you're gonna
hurt yourself.

45:26.091 --> 45:28.193
- You've got to give him the
knife.
- Rose.

45:28.226 --> 45:29.727
He--

45:29.761 --> 45:31.696
he looked at me.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.532
This is happening.
It's real. It's all happening.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.503
Okay, come on now.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.605
Just give him the knife!

45:42.607 --> 45:44.342
Easy. Easy.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.377
Kaitlan: Just give him
the knife, Rose.

45:48.379 --> 45:50.348
Okay.

45:51.917 --> 45:53.952
Okay. Thank you.

45:57.522 --> 45:59.891
It's real-- it's really--
it's real--

46:02.627 --> 46:04.295
I'm gonna go check it out.

46:10.101 --> 46:12.037
It's okay, Rose.

46:12.070 --> 46:14.505
I'm scared too, okay?

47:29.414 --> 47:31.049
Let me guess...

47:32.350 --> 47:34.185
No.

47:34.219 --> 47:36.421
Of course.

47:37.923 --> 47:40.625
I'm really sorry that
I freaked out at you guys.

47:40.658 --> 47:42.293
I don't know what's
going on with me.

47:42.327 --> 47:44.695
It's the game.

47:46.597 --> 47:48.934
I shouldn't have talked
you guys into playing it.

47:50.902 --> 47:52.637
I'm sorry.

47:56.341 --> 47:58.709
Listen, I--

47:58.743 --> 48:01.479
I think I'm just--
I'm gonna go home.

48:03.748 --> 48:05.483
Can you get a ride
from somebody else?

48:05.516 --> 48:07.485
Don't worry about me.

48:07.518 --> 48:10.055
I'll take her.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.493
Thank you for letting me stay.

48:15.526 --> 48:17.963
You have a very lovely home.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.764
Thank you.

48:26.204 --> 48:28.473
Do you guys mind helping me
clean up a little bit?

48:28.506 --> 48:29.975
The living room's a mess.

48:30.008 --> 48:32.377
Yeah, I guess I'll help.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.445
Thank you.

49:35.873 --> 49:37.108
Woman's voice:
He's behind you.

50:01.399 --> 50:02.867
Jeff?

50:24.822 --> 50:26.391
Jeff?

50:28.826 --> 50:30.895
Jeff?

50:32.963 --> 50:34.632
Jeff, are you okay?

51:45.403 --> 51:47.472
It's not my fault.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.575
Kaitlan:
Are you okay?

51:57.248 --> 51:59.517
I'm losing it.

52:04.789 --> 52:06.557
I'm turning into a schizo.

52:12.530 --> 52:15.166
- Rose?
- Hey.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.835
- What's wrong with Jenna?
- I thought you were going home?

52:17.868 --> 52:19.937
I decided to stay.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.173
Yeah, I thought I heard
your car leave.

52:22.207 --> 52:24.375
No, I was going to, but I--

52:24.409 --> 52:26.244
guess I fell asleep
or something.

52:28.746 --> 52:30.315
It's the game.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.917
That's why we're all so,

52:32.950 --> 52:34.852
I don't know,
whatever you want to call it.

52:34.885 --> 52:36.120
Just look at Jenna.

52:40.891 --> 52:43.060
Maybe you're right.

52:43.093 --> 52:44.962
Maybe this happens sometimes.

52:44.995 --> 52:47.232
Like, okay, remember
our candles went out

52:47.265 --> 52:49.099
and then we forgot
all about them.

52:49.133 --> 52:51.436
We didn't do the circle of salt
till the last minute.

52:51.469 --> 52:52.870
I mean, that's the problem.

52:52.903 --> 52:54.972
You said we have to do
everything
exactly as instructed, right?

52:58.676 --> 53:00.678
Shit.

53:01.879 --> 53:02.980
Jenna.

53:05.616 --> 53:07.318
Okay, so we play
the game again.

53:07.352 --> 53:08.653
Really?

53:08.686 --> 53:10.721
If we do everything right...

53:10.755 --> 53:13.291
What about Jeff?
Shouldn't Jeff be here?

53:15.693 --> 53:18.463
- Did you ever hear from him
today?
- No.

53:20.064 --> 53:22.667
I'm sure he's fine, then.
He's fine.

53:22.700 --> 53:25.670
Yeah. I'm gonna go
check on Jenna.

53:38.249 --> 53:39.850
Jenna?

53:44.689 --> 53:46.724
Jenna?

53:54.332 --> 53:55.933
- Shane: Shit!

53:55.966 --> 53:58.569
- Jenna.

54:02.907 --> 54:05.543
It's okay.
It's just me.

54:08.045 --> 54:10.147
Sweetheart, it's okay.

54:10.180 --> 54:11.949
Okay.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.851
Baby.

54:34.038 --> 54:36.341
- All: One, two, three,

54:36.374 --> 54:41.111
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine,

54:41.145 --> 54:44.181
10, 11, 12, 13,

54:44.214 --> 54:47.352
14, 15, 16, 17,

54:47.385 --> 54:50.755
18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

55:07.672 --> 55:10.541
So we'll just sit and wait.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.978
You relight the candle
immediately if it goes out

55:14.011 --> 55:16.681
and I have the salt right here.

55:16.714 --> 55:18.583
That's right.

55:22.186 --> 55:24.555
Kaitlan: Why are you
so quiet all of a sudden?

55:24.589 --> 55:26.891
Yeah, Shane, tell us.

55:31.128 --> 55:34.198
Well, I read about some...

55:34.231 --> 55:36.501
rumors online.

55:36.534 --> 55:38.302
About what?

55:38.335 --> 55:41.539
- Just weird shit, you know?
- Like?

55:41.572 --> 55:44.174
Like, you know, I think about it
like urban legend stuff.

55:44.208 --> 55:47.044
Like UFO stuff.
You know, it's not real.

55:47.077 --> 55:49.947
Shane, what did you hear?

55:51.749 --> 55:53.384
Well, apparently this guy
played the game

55:53.418 --> 55:55.019
with some friends of his
down in Stamford.

55:55.052 --> 55:56.554
He's a blogger,
he's blogging about it

55:56.587 --> 55:58.589
and he says that--

55:58.623 --> 56:00.925
he says that at first
it's really cool.

56:02.693 --> 56:07.297
And then he said that things
started to get really weird.

56:09.066 --> 56:11.969
And then he just
stopped blogging.

56:12.002 --> 56:16.140
And they found his remains
a few days later in the
backyard.

56:16.173 --> 56:18.643
Someone put him through
a wood chipper.

56:18.676 --> 56:20.945
You're kidding.

56:22.613 --> 56:24.682
This other site,

56:24.715 --> 56:26.984
it talked about how you can--

56:27.017 --> 56:29.454
how you can get trapped.

56:29.487 --> 56:32.423
- Trapped in what?
- Trapped in, like, a cycle.

56:32.457 --> 56:35.726
You know, like you live out--
or the last moment of your life,

56:35.760 --> 56:39.129
you live it out again
and again and again.

56:39.163 --> 56:40.698
God, that would suck.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.366
You fucking asshole.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.168
Shane:
Kait, I'm--

56:44.201 --> 56:46.170
Kait, come on, you know
it's not even possible.

56:47.171 --> 56:49.674
- Oh, shit.
- Jenna: Nine...

56:49.707 --> 56:52.777
- A match.
- ...eight, seven, six...

56:52.810 --> 56:55.312
- I thought I had one here.
- ...five, four...

56:55.345 --> 56:56.547
- Oh, shit.
- ...three...

56:56.581 --> 56:57.582
- Fuck!
- Kaitlan!

56:57.615 --> 56:59.283
...two, one.

56:59.316 --> 57:02.152
- We're fucked.
- Rose: Where's the salt?

57:02.186 --> 57:04.455
- Kaitlan!
- Shit.

57:04.489 --> 57:06.957
Scoop it into a circle.
There's enough left.

57:06.991 --> 57:08.859
I think it's a little late for
that.

57:08.893 --> 57:10.094
- Fuck.

57:10.127 --> 57:11.929
- Oh, God.

57:11.962 --> 57:14.364
Who the fuck is calling me?

57:23.508 --> 57:24.842
Who is it?

57:48.198 --> 57:50.400
Stay away from me.

57:52.402 --> 57:53.804
Shane:
What is wrong with her?

58:06.951 --> 58:09.086
I'm so glad you found me.

58:17.494 --> 58:20.030
You've got two ways
of looking at this.

58:20.064 --> 58:23.568
Shane's a lousy boyfriend
and a miserable fuck.

58:23.601 --> 58:27.037
So fuck his ass.

58:27.071 --> 58:29.574
The butcher knife
Rose was playing with--

58:29.607 --> 58:31.408
cut his head off.

58:33.611 --> 58:37.281
Or you can get
the hell out of here,

58:37.314 --> 58:39.717
do yourself in,

58:39.750 --> 58:42.853
and let that prick
spend the rest of his life

58:42.887 --> 58:46.090
knowing that it was his fault.

58:46.123 --> 58:48.559
Something's got to give, right?

59:00.605 --> 59:01.972
What do we do now, Rose?

59:02.006 --> 59:03.941
- I don't know.

59:03.974 --> 59:07.612
- What's wrong with her?
- God, what is that?

59:07.645 --> 59:09.513
Why don't you go look?

59:13.517 --> 59:15.119
It's Jeff.

59:16.453 --> 59:19.156
- He says he's here.
- What?

59:19.189 --> 59:20.591
Where?

59:54.558 --> 59:56.927
God, what is that noise?
God, I just wish it would stop.

59:56.961 --> 59:58.395
Go see what it is.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.611
- Jeff.

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:06.396
Really? Really?

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.505
Shane:
Kaitie? Kaitie?

01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:55.279
Kaitie.

01:02:02.987 --> 01:02:05.389
Kaitlan! Rose!

01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:15.699
Rose?

01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:19.804
Rose, it's Jeff.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.875
Rose?

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.881
- Where's Jenna?
- I don't know.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.789
Jenna?

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.793
Jenna!

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.105
Kaitlan!

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:10.220
Kaitie?

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:17.361
Kaitie! Kaitie!

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.063
Kaitie!

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:26.703
Kaitie.

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:32.276
Rose!

01:03:35.712 --> 01:03:37.014
Rose?

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:39.116
Rose!

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.224
Rose?

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:55.499
Woman's voice:
He's behind you.

01:03:58.135 --> 01:03:59.970
Behind you.

01:04:00.004 --> 01:04:02.039
- Rose!

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:06.476
He's behind you.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.448
Shane:
It's not my fault.

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:13.650
It's not my fault!

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.686
It's not my fault!

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:44.814
Wow.

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:56.360
Fuck me.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.929
You were right.

01:04:58.963 --> 01:05:01.698
I guess.
Whatever.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:04.034
Yay, Rose to the rescue.

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:07.771
I had the weirdest dream.

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:10.207
I don't know,
it was something.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:13.843
Oh, shit.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.050
Hey, everybody.
Hey, guys, what's up?

01:05:20.084 --> 01:05:22.152
Where have you been?

01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:24.288
I had practice this morning.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.855
And then I had to hang out
with my parents.

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:27.224
Then I snuck out.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:28.925
But not before grabbing
some shitty wine.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:30.894
Shane:
Cool.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.397
You guys knock yourself out.
I'm going to bed.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.365
Kaitlan:
Me, too.

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:38.368
Wh--

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:40.504
I'll tell you what.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.406
I'm gonna crack that open,

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.508
and I'm gonna drink it,

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:48.412
and I will tell you
everything tomorrow.

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.329
- Wow.
- Mmm.

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:43.233
Very nice, huh?

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:47.871
Nice.

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:56.646
As you can see,
everything is in top condition.

01:06:57.781 --> 01:07:01.351
It changed hands several times
in the past few decades.

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:06.356
- What's it listed at?
- Oh, let me get that for you.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.231
Here you go.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.601
We've lowered it a bit.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:20.070
It's been on the market
for almost two years.

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:21.671
How come?

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.840
Well, full disclosure here?

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.642
Yeah.

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:27.644
There was an incident
with some high school kids.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:29.446
This is that house?

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:30.947
Uh, yes.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.085
What's that?

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:41.024
Must be a breeze.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:45.129
Ahem. Would you like
to see upstairs?

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:47.264
No.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.809
You know, why don't I just
show you the other property?

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:01.745
It is just down the road
a few miles.

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:03.046
That high school quarterback,

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.249
some speculate that
he did all the killing.

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:07.684
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And he just disappeared.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.692
Kaitlan:
Hey, guys.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:54.398
- Rose: Whoa.
- Kaitlan: What?

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.932
Rose:
Nice house.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.401
Kaitlan: Yeah, my mom's
got a good job.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:59.435
Jenna: All right, snap out
of it, sunshine.
