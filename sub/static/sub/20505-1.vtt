00:25.723 --> 00:30.349
<i>I'm sane and rational, and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings.</i>

00:30.429 --> 00:35.523
<i>I'm sane and rational, and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings.</i>

00:35.603 --> 00:39.694
<i>I'm sane and rational, and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings.</i>

00:39.774 --> 00:42.865
<i>I'm sane and rational, and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings...</i>

02:42.427 --> 02:45.684
<i>Today the ex-leader of the National
Counter Terrorism Security Office...</i>

02:45.764 --> 02:48.787
<i>...has gone on record to say
it is a mistake to assume...</i>

02:48.867 --> 02:51.623
<i>...the next UK terrorist
attack will be in London...</i>

02:51.703 --> 02:55.427
<i>...and that Jihadists could just as
easily target Bristol or Portsmouth.</i>

02:55.507 --> 02:59.654
<i>Michael Burke resigned last month, citing
differences of opinion for his resignation.</i>

03:50.061 --> 03:52.384
<i>With the terror threats
at the second highest level...</i>

03:52.464 --> 03:55.020
<i>...the shadow defense ministered
has claimed that UK borders...</i>

03:55.100 --> 03:56.889
<i>...have never been more vulnerable.</i>

03:56.969 --> 04:00.487
<i>40% of the UK borders patrol vessels
have been moved to the Aegean Sea...</i>

04:00.567 --> 04:02.782
<i>...to deal with the migration crisis...</i>

05:15.112 --> 05:17.469
- Hello?
- Ms. Kane?

05:17.549 --> 05:20.372
I'm calling from East Sussex
Hospital surgical unit.

05:20.452 --> 05:22.458
We have a patient who needs
his appendix removed...

05:22.538 --> 05:24.996
<i>...but he's highly allergic to anesthetic.</i>

05:25.076 --> 05:28.480
Our regular therapist
is already engaged elsewhere.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.417
I see you've not practiced with us before,
could you provide a solution?

05:32.497 --> 05:35.854
- Yup. Yeah, of course.
- Our patient is in a critical condition.

05:35.934 --> 05:37.969
How soon could you get here?

05:38.049 --> 05:40.280
I can be there in 30 minutes.

05:57.421 --> 06:00.713
Pain is not required for this procedure.

06:01.393 --> 06:04.804
<i>Pain is not required for this procedure.</i>

06:17.107 --> 06:19.131
Dr. Collins, this is Holly Kane.

06:19.211 --> 06:21.690
We're a little bit pressed for time.

06:26.297 --> 06:29.074
Soon you're going to hear a rapid beat.

06:29.154 --> 06:32.577
This will entrain your brainwaves
into theta rhythm.

06:32.657 --> 06:36.173
It's a trance like state where your
subconscious can acquire information...

06:36.253 --> 06:38.939
...up to 2,000 words per minute.

06:40.448 --> 06:44.477
Subliminal suggestions will then
synchronize with the theta rhythm.

07:29.297 --> 07:31.603
- Hello?
- Good afternoon.

07:31.683 --> 07:35.474
This is David Goldmen, senior registrar
at the East Sussex Hospital.

07:35.554 --> 07:39.211
<i>I'm phoning about yesterday's
emergency appendectomy.</i>

07:39.291 --> 07:43.081
- <i>The patient is still numb.</i>
- That's to be expected.

07:43.161 --> 07:45.651
<i>The attending psychiatrist doesn't think so.</i>

07:46.231 --> 07:50.555
- The psychiatrist?
- He believes your technique is dangerous.

07:50.635 --> 07:54.092
It isn't dangerous.
The patient just isn't feeling any pain.

07:54.172 --> 07:56.528
Just give it time, it'll pass.

07:56.608 --> 08:00.621
<i>He's watched the video footage and he
thinks there are grounds for malpractice.</i>

08:02.581 --> 08:05.531
This is ridiculous. What's his name?
I'll speak to him.

08:05.611 --> 08:10.095
I'm afraid our legal department
will be in touch, Ms. Kane.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.277
I'm not my sister. I'm not my sister.

08:46.357 --> 08:48.167
<i>I'm not my sister.</i>

09:00.754 --> 09:02.861
Sounds like bollocks to me.

09:02.941 --> 09:06.264
The attending psychiatrist is obviously
the one that's incorrect.

09:06.344 --> 09:08.867
It's just another mind
control technique to them.

09:08.947 --> 09:12.303
Fuck him! Look, he hasn't got
a case anyway. Have a drink.

09:12.383 --> 09:16.708
- Have some drugs.
- What's the next cocktail?

09:16.788 --> 09:19.511
90 mils of MD with a pinch
of ket and Thai grass.

09:19.591 --> 09:22.347
You know, you could this and retreat.

09:22.427 --> 09:25.504
I need something stronger.

09:26.898 --> 09:29.621
I guess you're talkin' about
research rather than recreation...

09:29.701 --> 09:33.912
...since you won't even smoke a joint
for fear of turning into your sister.

09:34.238 --> 09:36.194
What do you need?

09:36.274 --> 09:38.963
What you gave me is great,
but I need to go deeper.

09:39.043 --> 09:41.780
Deeply held beliefs are just
further down than I thought.

09:41.860 --> 09:46.337
I need to get to a place where I can access
the absolute depths of my subconscious.

09:46.417 --> 09:49.174
You need to get out more.

09:49.254 --> 09:53.244
You know, step off the hamster wheel.
Kickback, unwind, chill out.

09:53.324 --> 09:55.517
Relax, playa.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.536
Please.

09:59.930 --> 10:04.045
- I suppose it might be possible.
- Oh, you are a legend.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.711
You haven't told anyone else
about this, have you?

10:06.791 --> 10:09.327
No one knows apart from me and you.

10:09.407 --> 10:13.098
Alright, well as long as it stays
that way, I'll give it a go.

10:13.178 --> 10:15.466
That is why I love you.

10:15.546 --> 10:18.024
- You're buying the shots.
- Fine.

10:30.795 --> 10:34.185
<i>Hello, Ms. Kane.
My name is Marvin Greenslade.</i>

10:34.265 --> 10:37.087
<i>You might've heard of me, I was
fortunate enough in the 1980's...</i>

10:37.167 --> 10:40.625
<i>...to achieve one or two successes
in the debriefing of cult victims.</i>

10:40.705 --> 10:43.428
<i>It should be easy enough to research me.</i>

10:43.508 --> 10:48.288
<i>I'd very much like to speak to you about
something. Please, call me back anytime.</i>

10:56.697 --> 10:59.477
- Marvin Greenslade?
- <i>It's Holly Kane.</i>

10:59.557 --> 11:02.761
Ms. Kane! How very kind of you
to return my call.

11:03.161 --> 11:07.652
I did my thesis in subliminals.
Your work was very influential.

11:07.732 --> 11:12.757
Forgive me, I'm in the process of
escaping a rather tedious gala dinner.

11:12.837 --> 11:16.361
Would you allow me to buy you
lunch tomorrow here in London?

11:16.441 --> 11:20.583
I'd very much like to speak to you
about something I've been working on.

11:22.446 --> 11:24.908
<i>Security forces are on high alert today...</i>

11:24.988 --> 11:28.019
<i>...after Islamic state terrorists
told the United Kingdom...</i>

11:28.099 --> 11:32.636
<i>...to expect a doomsday attack that
will eclipse the brutal Paris killings...</i>

11:32.716 --> 11:34.746
<i>...and turn children's hair white.</i>

11:34.826 --> 11:40.332
<i>The threat was made in the latest edition
of extremist Arabic newspaper, Al-naba.</i>

11:43.754 --> 11:46.725
Theta entrained by neuro suggestion.

11:47.155 --> 11:48.460
Ingenious.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.062
There is a little bit more to it than that.

11:51.142 --> 11:54.152
But I'm guessing you haven't
given up all your trade secrets.

11:54.232 --> 11:57.869
Well, I wouldn't want anybody to replicate
my technique without my permission.

11:57.949 --> 11:59.793
Just as I thought.

12:00.652 --> 12:02.907
So what can I do for you, Mr. Greenslade?

12:02.987 --> 12:08.213
Marvin, please. I run a research unit
for psychological investigation.

12:09.293 --> 12:12.720
Most research units wouldn't go
anywhere near something like this...

12:12.800 --> 12:14.801
...they'd see it as brainwashing.

12:16.167 --> 12:19.157
As one of the original members
of the anti-cult movement...

12:19.237 --> 12:21.059
...I don't hold with that view at all.

12:21.139 --> 12:24.762
We've found plenty of evidence
of the efficacy of such techniques.

12:24.842 --> 12:27.930
In fact, I'm of the firm belief that
in the 1980's the whole concept...

12:28.010 --> 12:32.837
...of mind control was deliberately
discredited by vested interests...

12:32.917 --> 12:37.642
...including mainstream religions,
governments, and the corporate world...

12:37.722 --> 12:41.379
...all of whom never stopped
trying to control our minds.

12:41.459 --> 12:45.470
The general populace has been
brainwashed to dismiss brainwashing.

12:45.550 --> 12:47.386
I can believe that.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.553
So who funds you?

12:49.633 --> 12:53.213
I came into some money which
allows me to indulge my passion...

12:53.293 --> 12:57.115
...for researching projects
which might benefit society.

12:57.207 --> 12:58.263
Why me?

12:58.343 --> 13:02.219
Because no one else thought
to synchronize subliminal suggestion...

13:02.299 --> 13:05.503
...with the whole brain state.
Have you done trials?

13:05.583 --> 13:08.707
- Not yet.
- I can get that organized for you.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.111
I'm a great believer in experimentation.

13:13.524 --> 13:17.223
I could also probably extricate you
from any legal proceedings...

13:17.303 --> 13:20.185
...attended on your
little hospital adventure.

13:20.815 --> 13:23.187
You're very well informed.

13:23.267 --> 13:27.453
Old school tie, I'm afraid.
The senior registrar was a classmate.

13:29.973 --> 13:33.098
Well, I would need some time
to develop my technique.

13:33.178 --> 13:36.268
- I have clients I'd still need to see.
- Of course.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.860
But surely you've already proved
that your technique works.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.745
All that's missing are the clinical trials.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.375
Most hypnosis can achieve what I've done.

13:44.455 --> 13:48.110
I need to ensure that I can consistently
change deeply held beliefs...

13:48.190 --> 13:52.031
...before the trials. I need this
to work on any limiting belief.

13:53.031 --> 13:57.910
To get the unconscious to accept
whatever you choose for it to believe.

13:59.736 --> 14:01.560
It's the holy grail.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.663
People suffer when the subconscious
makes up its own mind.

14:05.743 --> 14:07.632
Any ideas?

14:07.712 --> 14:10.136
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.

14:11.216 --> 14:13.888
<i>A senior French counter-terrorism
church has today warned...</i>

14:13.968 --> 14:16.823
<i>...that Isis has sent
dozens of Jihadists to Europe...</i>

14:16.903 --> 14:20.909
<i>...to carry out loan wolf attacks, thereby
squandering intelligence agencies...</i>

14:20.989 --> 14:24.469
<i>...with unsophisticated attacks
while larger...</i>

14:30.734 --> 14:33.757
I don't normally do things like this, but...

14:33.837 --> 14:37.495
...I've got butterflies in my stomach
just thinking about it.

14:37.575 --> 14:39.664
Would you have dinner with me?

14:40.244 --> 14:43.668
Nothing fancy, just a pizza or something.

14:44.048 --> 14:47.059
That's really sweet of you,
but I'm busy. I'm sorry.

14:48.085 --> 14:50.575
I was... I was afraid you'd say that.

14:50.955 --> 14:53.211
These butterflies feel like lead now.

14:53.791 --> 14:56.434
You seem to be very aware of your emotions.

14:56.514 --> 15:00.118
- They keep me sane.
- Is that something you need to worry about?

15:00.198 --> 15:03.691
- Not when I stay with my feelings.
- What about when you need to think?

15:03.771 --> 15:07.258
Most things of interest happen
without any input from the mind.

15:07.338 --> 15:11.397
- I'm not sure I agree.
- That's because you're thinking about it.

15:12.577 --> 15:14.490
Have dinner with me.

15:15.378 --> 15:17.834
Don't pay any attention to your mind.

15:21.018 --> 15:22.594
Yes.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.510
Are you sure?

15:25.590 --> 15:27.671
Give me a time and a place.

16:06.997 --> 16:10.570
I need some inspirations, Al Harani.

16:16.873 --> 16:20.753
How do you plunge someone
into their unconscious...

16:21.842 --> 16:25.073
...without making them unconscious?

17:19.636 --> 17:22.085
So what drove you out of your mind?

17:24.156 --> 17:26.202
You've been thinking about me.

17:27.744 --> 17:30.334
My mind tends to do that sometimes.

17:30.414 --> 17:34.293
- Don't let it run away with ya.
- You avoiding my question?

17:38.321 --> 17:40.900
My wife left me for somebody else...

17:42.893 --> 17:44.769
...and I...

17:46.096 --> 17:51.170
...I realized I hadn't only been
in the wrong relationship, but in...

17:52.090 --> 17:54.713
...in the wrong career as well. So...

17:57.941 --> 17:59.985
...I had a bit of a meltdown.

18:02.679 --> 18:04.757
What kind of meltdown?

18:08.151 --> 18:10.196
I thought I was going crazy.

18:10.605 --> 18:12.165
I...

18:13.123 --> 18:17.742
...I was obsessing all the time,
I was clinging to everything.

18:20.564 --> 18:22.954
And then one day, it just... it just clicked.

18:23.034 --> 18:27.991
I just... I realized
that I had to just feel it all...

18:28.071 --> 18:31.764
...and the more I felt,
the more the craziness receded.

18:32.944 --> 18:35.517
Then I moved to the seaside
and I got a job as a gardener...

18:35.597 --> 18:38.486
...and began to feel better.

18:40.984 --> 18:42.808
What did you do before?

18:43.588 --> 18:46.028
I was a civil servant.

18:46.991 --> 18:50.287
Well, I could see how that
might not have helped.

18:52.796 --> 18:55.441
So do you have any other family?

18:57.634 --> 18:59.657
You ask a lot of questions.

18:59.737 --> 19:01.747
I'm interested.

19:02.506 --> 19:03.892
Sisters?

19:04.174 --> 19:06.230
I would've liked one, but no.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.887
Brothers?

19:08.945 --> 19:10.822
I'm afraid not.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.210
You look sad.

19:16.019 --> 19:18.296
You don't let up.

19:34.804 --> 19:38.730
- Are you avoiding the camera?
- No need for them to know my business.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.432
Do you want them to see you?

19:41.712 --> 19:44.968
It's not just CCTV anymore.

19:45.048 --> 19:46.918
They have intelligent video analytics...

19:46.998 --> 19:51.262
...which uses facial recognition
and process inspection programs.

19:52.689 --> 19:55.113
You are being watched.

19:55.893 --> 19:59.610
We've got algorithms which can
distinguish objects of interest.

19:59.690 --> 20:02.212
It means that every camera in the city...

20:02.292 --> 20:06.712
...could potentially be programmed
to monitor my specific activities.

20:08.438 --> 20:12.919
I have to warn you, you're beginning
to sound a little bit paranoid.

20:16.547 --> 20:18.869
Sorry, I...

20:18.949 --> 20:21.593
- ...I was thinking again.
- Yeah.

20:47.078 --> 20:49.367
Looks like we picked the wrong night.

20:49.897 --> 20:52.174
I think we should take some cover.

22:35.352 --> 22:38.143
So... this is it.

22:38.223 --> 22:40.098
Or will be.

22:41.091 --> 22:44.170
I have your list of specifications so we
should be able to get it all kitted out...

22:44.250 --> 22:46.951
- ...over the weekend.
- That's quick.

22:47.031 --> 22:49.107
Old school tie again?

22:49.966 --> 22:51.440
Incidentally...

22:51.520 --> 22:56.747
...I wanted to let you know
that we employ security here.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.568
So you'll be pursuing your goals...

22:59.648 --> 23:03.634
...in an environment that not only
supports you but also protects you.

23:03.714 --> 23:06.137
As long as it doesn't interfere with my work.

23:06.217 --> 23:10.823
I need to be autonomous.
It's my technique and I call the shots.

23:11.655 --> 23:15.044
I knew immediately that you were
a very strong and independent woman.

23:17.193 --> 23:20.673
And an extremely attractive
one too, if I may say so.

23:22.299 --> 23:25.777
You make me feel 30 years younger.

23:29.472 --> 23:32.930
I need to get it right,
and get it out into the world.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.466
It has the potential to have a huge impact.

23:36.046 --> 23:38.373
I couldn't agree more.

23:43.491 --> 23:47.211
The beach man sounds way more
lovable than the old Etonian.

23:47.291 --> 23:49.947
You would say that about a serial killer.

23:50.027 --> 23:53.047
There must be other ways
to get clinical trials funded.

23:53.397 --> 23:56.587
None that can get the threat
of malpractice to disappear.

23:56.667 --> 23:59.990
Doesn't it bother you that he can do that?

24:00.070 --> 24:02.793
No, I was too relieved
to give it much thought.

24:02.873 --> 24:05.596
God, there's nowhere
that these people can't reach.

24:05.676 --> 24:09.733
Just because he went to Eton doesn't mean
he's a member of the bloody new world order.

24:09.813 --> 24:13.167
- It's all a part of the same club.
- This guy was a hero to me a uni.

24:13.247 --> 24:15.606
Yeah, you always had a thing for power.

24:15.686 --> 24:18.974
And you've always had a thing
for conspiracy theories.

24:20.257 --> 24:25.049
Does your hero know that your technique
involves using illegal substances?

24:25.129 --> 24:27.017
You made the potion.

24:27.097 --> 24:29.183
Amanita Muscaria mushrooms...

24:29.263 --> 24:32.956
...two monoamine oxidase inhibitors
to boost the psilocybin...

24:33.036 --> 24:35.863
...and one or two of my secret ingredients.

24:36.640 --> 24:40.030
You drink this.
There are three doses in there.

24:40.110 --> 24:43.560
Go easy, and keep it...

24:43.640 --> 24:46.293
...very much to yourself.

24:49.619 --> 24:53.674
- You are a genius.
- Yeah, I know.

25:10.674 --> 25:14.622
A full spec computer with industry
standard audio software and interface...

25:14.702 --> 25:16.593
...capable of delivering...

25:16.673 --> 25:20.340
...multi track audio up to 192 kilohertz.

25:20.420 --> 25:23.308
I assume you have your own software as well.

25:24.188 --> 25:26.082
And here...

25:27.879 --> 25:30.307
...is your sensory deprivation float tank.

25:30.387 --> 25:35.185
It's filled with 25% Epsom salt solution
heated to 34.5 degrees Celsius...

25:35.265 --> 25:40.224
...plus you have wireless earphones
and a wireless EEG/ECG system.

25:40.304 --> 25:42.457
And as you know...

25:42.537 --> 25:44.971
...I'm also providing security...

25:45.051 --> 25:47.549
...in order to shield you from...

25:48.207 --> 25:50.393
...negative influences.

25:50.473 --> 25:51.968
And...

25:52.048 --> 25:53.470
...well...

25:53.550 --> 25:55.505
...the truth is...

25:55.585 --> 25:58.135
...I'm afraid the man
that you've been seeing...

25:58.215 --> 26:00.177
...raises concerns.

26:00.257 --> 26:02.346
The man I've been seeing?

26:02.726 --> 26:07.117
I've only seen him once, and it's none
of your business who I socialize with.

26:07.197 --> 26:09.653
On the face of it, he's a nobody.

26:09.733 --> 26:11.955
But Dennis MacIntyre was until recently...

26:12.035 --> 26:15.392
...a senior image analyst
for Defense Intelligence.

26:15.472 --> 26:17.961
A branch of the Ministry of Defense.

26:18.041 --> 26:22.300
That makes his somewhat of an authority
on clandestine operations...

26:22.580 --> 26:25.335
...which in itself means nothing.

26:25.415 --> 26:29.410
But MacIntyre left the service
under suspicious circumstances and...

26:29.490 --> 26:32.297
...he has a brother
who's a minor arms dealer.

26:33.339 --> 26:34.843
That raises concerns.

26:36.659 --> 26:40.017
I can see that he hasn't been
completely candid with you.

26:40.097 --> 26:42.912
You haven't been completely candid with me.

26:44.768 --> 26:47.552
Although the psychological community
has been insisting for years...

26:47.632 --> 26:50.468
...that mind control techniques don't work...

26:51.049 --> 26:53.126
...you and I both know better.

26:53.544 --> 26:55.754
And we're by no means alone.

26:56.846 --> 27:01.143
The CIA and the NSA both employ them,
and radical groups around the world...

27:01.223 --> 27:04.809
...would give right teeth to get their
hands on it. An efficient technique.

27:04.889 --> 27:08.146
Not to mention the Chinese
and the North Koreans.

27:09.526 --> 27:12.150
You've exposed what you're doing online.

27:12.580 --> 27:15.002
You've told the world most of your secrets.

27:15.132 --> 27:18.023
That's partly why I stepped in
to offer support.

27:19.203 --> 27:23.774
I was hoping to avoid making you
paranoid, but the truth of the matter is...

27:23.854 --> 27:27.952
...you are in need of constant protection.

28:14.423 --> 28:17.981
I am not my sister. I am sane and rational...

28:18.061 --> 28:21.485
...and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings.

28:22.365 --> 28:26.023
<i>I am not my sister. I am sane and rational...</i>

28:26.103 --> 28:29.880
<i>...and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings.</i>

32:36.552 --> 32:39.984
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

32:41.924 --> 32:45.049
Where did you work
when you were in the civil service?

32:45.129 --> 32:47.220
Actually, it was the...

32:47.721 --> 32:50.730
- ...the MOD.
- What exactly did you do?

32:51.301 --> 32:53.445
I was an image analyst.

32:55.504 --> 32:58.481
I worked with UAVs,
unmanned aerial vehicles...

32:58.561 --> 33:02.894
...which can identify a milk bottle
from an altitude of 6,000 feet...

33:03.914 --> 33:05.209
...and they...

33:05.849 --> 33:09.274
...they carry infrared devices...

33:09.354 --> 33:11.785
...which can detect the heat
from a human body...

33:11.865 --> 33:14.978
...at distances of up to 37 miles.

33:15.058 --> 33:18.870
Sounds like you know a thing or two
about clandestine operations.

33:21.163 --> 33:23.040
I suppose.

33:25.467 --> 33:27.915
- What about your brother?
- My brother?

33:28.205 --> 33:31.862
- The arms dealer?
- How could you possibly know that?

33:31.942 --> 33:35.753
- Did you just forget about him?
- I'm trying to.

33:38.097 --> 33:40.637
- What's going on?
- I'm leaving.

33:40.717 --> 33:42.606
Because I didn't tell you about my brother?

33:42.686 --> 33:45.295
Because I don't appreciate
people lying to me.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.964
Holly!

36:37.466 --> 36:41.151
<i>I am not my sister. I am sane and rational...</i>

36:41.231 --> 36:45.075
<i>...and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings.</i>

36:45.468 --> 36:47.344
Come in.

36:48.237 --> 36:51.259
Hi. I've got the papers for you
to sign so that we can get started...

36:51.339 --> 36:53.751
...on the protocol registration
system for your trials.

36:53.831 --> 36:55.831
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

36:55.911 --> 36:58.001
Distractions are welcome today.

36:58.081 --> 37:01.671
In that case,
let me distract you with a nice lunch.

37:01.751 --> 37:04.842
- That would be lovely.
- I'll leave these for you.

37:05.222 --> 37:07.265
Call for you at 12:30.

38:24.132 --> 38:26.010
Is everything alright?

38:26.735 --> 38:28.579
You seem distracted.

38:30.373 --> 38:34.252
I think it's my resistance to a new thought.

38:35.077 --> 38:36.966
What are the symptoms?

38:37.046 --> 38:38.622
Confusion.

38:39.114 --> 38:41.592
Can you be more specific?

38:42.784 --> 38:44.608
Not really.

38:45.088 --> 38:48.165
Don't worry, just relax.

38:48.691 --> 38:51.348
Allow the thought to have its effect.

38:51.428 --> 38:53.583
What if I've picked the wrong one?

38:53.663 --> 38:55.585
A single erroneous thought...

38:55.665 --> 38:58.556
...is not gonna plunge you into madness.

38:59.436 --> 39:02.272
- Madness?
- I mean...

39:02.352 --> 39:05.375
...I'm just saying that you're more
than intelligent enough to be able to...

39:05.455 --> 39:08.064
...make a mistake and learn from it.

39:08.144 --> 39:10.333
You know about Rosalyn.

39:10.413 --> 39:12.836
I was just making an observation.

39:13.616 --> 39:15.805
You know about a guy I met in a cafe.

39:15.885 --> 39:18.742
Of course you know
about my schizophrenic sister.

39:19.622 --> 39:21.711
Perhaps you know about my mother, too.

39:21.791 --> 39:26.429
She was bipolar with a hypersexual
disorder, that was always a big secret.

39:26.996 --> 39:29.586
Both my parents are dead now
so that doesn't matter...

39:29.666 --> 39:33.356
...and that means you think
you understand my motivations.

39:33.436 --> 39:36.052
Child grows up in fear of madness,
becomes a psychologist...

39:36.132 --> 39:39.529
...to try and save her crazy family.
Well, that's bullshit.

39:39.609 --> 39:42.632
I know who I am and I'm quite sane,
thank you very much.

39:42.712 --> 39:44.685
I never doubted it for a moment.

39:45.415 --> 39:47.304
You're a very impressive woman.

39:47.384 --> 39:50.010
Rational, smart, and perceptive.

39:51.203 --> 39:53.260
And I can see that I've upset you.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.079
Allow me to make amends.

39:56.293 --> 40:00.351
I have two tickets for
"The Damnation of Faust" tonight.

40:01.231 --> 40:03.073
Sounds like fun.

40:52.814 --> 40:54.790
I thought it was romantic.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.604
- Religious nonsense.
- You don't believe in souls?

40:57.684 --> 41:00.810
Margarite did not ascend to heaven
in Goethe's original version.

41:00.890 --> 41:02.379
You don't believe in souls.

41:02.459 --> 41:05.465
Goethe held that one
could be inwardly Christian...

41:05.545 --> 41:08.832
...without following any of the church's
accepted beliefs and practices.

41:08.912 --> 41:12.555
He damned the whole history
of Christian theology...

41:12.635 --> 41:15.191
...as a hodgepodge of fallacy and violence.

41:15.271 --> 41:17.343
Some people find solace in their faith.

41:17.423 --> 41:20.063
Which allows radicals
to find solace in death...

41:20.143 --> 41:22.591
...and that's what makes them so dangerous.

41:23.179 --> 41:26.102
- But I'm being gloomy.
- You picked a gloomy opera.

41:26.182 --> 41:28.738
Something a little lighter next time?

41:28.818 --> 41:30.827
The circus maybe?

41:42.297 --> 41:44.420
Thank you for this evening.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.577
My pleasure entirely.

41:54.543 --> 41:56.420
I'm sorry.

41:56.718 --> 41:59.135
I made an unwelcome advance.

41:59.215 --> 42:01.091
It's not you.

42:01.350 --> 42:03.560
I'm just really disorientated.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.892
The whole day's been strange.

42:06.972 --> 42:09.446
Your resistance to new thoughts?

42:10.376 --> 42:12.485
Sorry, I'm being boring.

42:12.795 --> 42:16.207
Give it a little time, see where it leads.

42:17.065 --> 42:19.343
That's how research works.

42:29.344 --> 42:31.822
How was the cocktail?

42:32.781 --> 42:34.592
It did something...

42:36.251 --> 42:38.129
...I just don't know what.

42:39.738 --> 42:42.796
Everything just feels really upside down.

42:43.726 --> 42:46.749
- It worked pretty well for me.
- You had some?

42:46.829 --> 42:50.186
Do you think I'd give you
something if I didn't test it?

42:50.266 --> 42:54.960
I went to the cinema and watched
some shitty horror film in...

42:55.657 --> 42:59.081
...3-D, or 4-D, or maybe even 5-D.

42:59.875 --> 43:03.688
I'm certain it took me
to where I needed to go.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.715
I'm just... I'm not sure what happened there.

43:11.286 --> 43:14.596
How is your new employer?

43:14.676 --> 43:18.735
He's simply making it possible
for me to do clinical trials.

43:19.228 --> 43:23.313
Everything you're doing
looks a little desperate to me.

43:23.393 --> 43:26.055
Well, that's because you see
through paranoid eyes.

43:28.487 --> 43:32.010
You have got to learn to chill out, Holly.

43:53.345 --> 43:57.720
She was troubled from birth.
Even as a baby, she didn't look quite right.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.490
- Poor thing.
- Not that I noticed at the time.

44:00.570 --> 44:05.061
She was great at first, but as she
got older she just got weirder.

44:05.591 --> 44:09.500
- I just didn't want to be around her.
- That must've been confusing for you.

44:10.447 --> 44:12.879
Not as confusing as when my parents...

44:12.959 --> 44:15.652
...took off in the car
and then came back without her.

44:15.732 --> 44:18.708
You would've thought my father would've
dropped my mother off at the same time...

44:18.788 --> 44:20.989
...but he always forgave her for everything.

44:22.558 --> 44:26.016
You have a talent for getting
information out of people.

44:26.496 --> 44:28.618
You're a very interesting woman.

44:28.698 --> 44:30.274
<i>Grazie.</i>

44:33.802 --> 44:35.858
Was the owner schooled at Eton?

44:35.938 --> 44:37.894
Somewhere in Turin, I believe.

44:37.974 --> 44:42.032
I performed a small favor for him once
and he feels indebted to me.

44:42.612 --> 44:46.235
So you called out to your mafia connections.

44:46.315 --> 44:49.490
The mafia is just another violent cult
sanctioning psychopaths...

44:49.570 --> 44:52.976
- ...to kill those who oppose them.
- That sounds like a no.

44:53.606 --> 44:56.980
Violent cults are the biggest threat
of the world today.

44:57.060 --> 45:01.667
The Jihadists get the most airtime,
but zionists, creationists...

45:01.747 --> 45:03.986
...radical nationalists, no less dangerous.

45:04.066 --> 45:07.090
They're all prepared to kill and maim
in the name of their beliefs.

45:07.170 --> 45:10.093
Sounds like religion
is the real thorn in your side.

45:10.173 --> 45:14.496
The problem is always the unthinking,
unquestioning acceptance...

45:14.576 --> 45:16.599
...of someone else's ideas.

45:17.079 --> 45:19.169
But I'm being gloomy again.

45:20.099 --> 45:22.238
You really should go to the circus.

45:22.318 --> 45:24.128
Perhaps you're right.

45:53.248 --> 45:55.119
Nice view.

45:56.418 --> 45:58.316
I couldn't agree more.

46:08.263 --> 46:10.353
You're a very attractive woman.

46:11.133 --> 46:13.589
Don't forget my mind.

46:13.960 --> 46:16.164
How could I ever forget your mind?

46:16.539 --> 46:19.128
Actually, sometimes I wish I could.

46:19.208 --> 46:23.248
As far as I'm concerned,
it's operating perfectly.

46:25.614 --> 46:27.190
You...

46:30.068 --> 46:31.879
...are very beautiful.

47:34.549 --> 47:37.340
- I should leave.
- You don't want to stay?

47:37.420 --> 47:40.242
- I need my bed.
- But it's late.

47:40.322 --> 47:43.646
- The trains are still running.
- I'll organize a lift for you.

47:43.726 --> 47:45.848
No, I'll walk.

47:45.928 --> 47:49.786
No, no. I insist on a lift,
even if it's only as far as the station.

47:49.866 --> 47:52.310
You know how independent I am.

49:09.110 --> 49:10.032
Fuck's sake.

49:10.112 --> 49:12.034
- Please keep your voice down.
- What are you doing?

49:12.114 --> 49:15.398
I'm trying to be careful, which is
something you're completely failing to do.

49:15.918 --> 49:18.854
Look, I'm sorry but I don't
want to see you again.

49:18.934 --> 49:20.336
I thought I made that perfectly clear.

49:20.416 --> 49:23.880
Is that because of your cozy dinners
with Marvin Greenslade?

49:23.960 --> 49:26.916
Is he your boss, your boyfriend, or both?

49:26.996 --> 49:30.753
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I've been doing some research.

49:30.833 --> 49:34.957
After his success with subliminals
throughout the 80's...

49:35.037 --> 49:37.393
...Marvin went for the money.

49:37.473 --> 49:42.071
Through the 90's he worked as a consultant
for international marketing firms.

49:42.151 --> 49:43.766
It paid well.

49:43.846 --> 49:48.485
Marvin acquired a portfolio of properties
and a sure bit of inquire...

49:48.565 --> 49:51.374
...but his greatest success was yet to come.

49:51.914 --> 49:53.883
This guy keeps such a low profile...

49:53.963 --> 49:57.513
...that you need high level clearance
to find out anything about him.

49:57.593 --> 50:02.955
But last year he began to work for
the Prime Minister as a special advisor.

50:03.098 --> 50:07.757
It's been a long time coming, Marvin's been
a member of the party for the last 20 years.

50:07.837 --> 50:11.946
He's the first real mentor figure
that the PM ever had.

50:42.737 --> 50:44.761
<i>Marvin Greenslade.</i>

50:45.591 --> 50:47.667
<i>Advisor to the PM.</i>

50:48.643 --> 50:50.720
<i>Early 70's.</i>

50:51.479 --> 50:53.290
<i>Well dressed.</i>

50:53.982 --> 50:55.859
<i>Well spoken.</i>

50:57.185 --> 50:58.762
<i>Subliminals.</i>

51:00.088 --> 51:01.645
<i>Marketing.</i>

51:03.024 --> 51:04.221
<i>Deceitful.</i>

51:05.697 --> 51:07.370
<i>Desirable.</i>

51:09.264 --> 51:10.874
<i>Desirable?</i>

51:21.610 --> 51:25.201
<i>I am not my sister. I am sane and rational...</i>

51:25.281 --> 51:28.958
<i>...and I am in control
of my thoughts and feelings.</i>

51:36.444 --> 51:38.681
<i>I keep nothing from Marvin.</i>

51:38.761 --> 51:41.017
<i>I tell him whatever he wants to know.</i>

51:41.097 --> 51:44.987
<i>I don't want Dennis MacIntyre, I want Marvin.</i>

51:45.067 --> 51:46.856
<i>I trust Marvin.</i>

51:46.936 --> 51:48.959
<i>I want him sexually.</i>

51:52.974 --> 51:55.388
He fuckin' switched my thoughts!

52:29.377 --> 52:30.966
What the hell's going on?

52:31.046 --> 52:33.869
She found out you switched her thoughts.

52:33.949 --> 52:35.826
This is out of character.

52:37.735 --> 52:41.610
- I was simply securing her cooperation.
- Is that what you were doing?

52:41.690 --> 52:45.447
We need to know if her technique
is efficacious on unwilling subjects.

52:45.527 --> 52:47.750
We already know that it isn't.

52:48.230 --> 52:51.553
We've replicated her technique
on 11 different subjects.

52:51.633 --> 52:54.590
In every case the fundamentalism
is still evident.

52:54.670 --> 52:59.095
Perhaps radical beliefs are more
tenacious than romantic inclinations.

52:59.175 --> 53:02.247
All it takes is one phone call
to the wrong person...

53:02.327 --> 53:06.635
...and the entire operation is exposed.
What you're doing is dangerous.

53:06.715 --> 53:09.638
Nonsense. Everything is under control.

53:09.718 --> 53:11.473
And MacIntyre?

53:11.553 --> 53:14.777
We know he access the operations
roster and ran a search on you.

53:14.857 --> 53:18.113
God knows what he told her.
We should at least eliminate him.

53:18.193 --> 53:19.749
No!

53:20.528 --> 53:22.406
I've got a better idea.

53:24.015 --> 53:27.234
By the way, I watched her experiment
again and I found something.

53:28.703 --> 53:32.833
When she came out of the toilet, she looked
like she had a bad taste in her mouth.

53:33.709 --> 53:35.217
This...

53:35.297 --> 53:39.556
...is why she laid down for 60 minutes
in the dark before she got in the tank.

53:41.549 --> 53:43.627
The trick up her sleeve.

53:50.158 --> 53:52.436
Get the rest of this analyzed.

54:16.784 --> 54:19.041
In order to avoid insanity...

54:19.721 --> 54:22.399
...I must remain close to Marvin...

54:23.307 --> 54:25.535
...and be open with him.

54:26.995 --> 54:29.072
I want Marvin.

54:30.464 --> 54:33.342
I have no memory of coercion.

56:12.066 --> 56:13.576
Holly?

56:13.834 --> 56:16.362
Holly, are you alright?

56:17.705 --> 56:21.817
I couldn't raise you. I waited
and waited, I didn't want to intrude.

56:22.077 --> 56:25.467
- I think you've been in here about 3 hours.
- Three hours?

56:25.547 --> 56:28.916
I know how you value your independence,
I didn't want to interfere.

56:30.885 --> 56:33.155
I must have fallen sleep.

56:33.792 --> 56:37.212
I switched off the audio file
that was playing.

56:37.292 --> 56:39.381
Is this the different kind of experiment?

56:39.461 --> 56:43.786
No, we didn't write it about them.
I'll let you read it.

56:43.866 --> 56:46.876
Come on, let's get you out. Come on.

56:48.869 --> 56:51.961
I have to attend to something
before I take you to my apartment.

56:52.441 --> 56:54.318
I'll just be five minutes.

57:04.585 --> 57:07.927
- You fed him the liquid?
- 62 minutes ago.

57:13.127 --> 57:16.537
I am insane.

57:17.992 --> 57:21.223
Leave him in there for a couple
of hours, then dump him somewhere.

57:21.303 --> 57:23.459
And keep him under surveillance.

57:23.539 --> 57:27.303
I need to know exactly how
<i>non compos mentis</i> he becomes.

57:29.811 --> 57:31.687
Here we are.

57:34.816 --> 57:37.840
Are you a special advisor
to the Prime Minister?

57:38.820 --> 57:41.010
How did you find out about that?

57:41.090 --> 57:43.379
A little birdy told me.

57:43.459 --> 57:45.147
Something of a secret, really.

57:45.227 --> 57:48.372
The PM's worried that having someone
with my background as an advisor...

57:48.452 --> 57:50.449
...might send out the wrong message.

57:50.832 --> 57:55.378
- What do you advise him on?
- Just marketing and PR stuff.

58:00.274 --> 58:02.353
You're quite safe with me, Holly.

58:04.012 --> 58:06.253
It doesn't matter to me...

58:06.333 --> 58:08.570
...if your experiment went wrong.

58:08.950 --> 58:11.995
Research is an ongoing process.

58:12.753 --> 58:14.574
I'll look after you...

58:14.654 --> 58:17.276
...and provide you with whatever you need.

58:17.978 --> 58:19.502
Now...

58:22.113 --> 58:24.363
...how can I be of service to you.

58:25.601 --> 58:27.677
Just talk to me.

01:01:19.306 --> 01:01:21.813
So do we know what was in it?

01:01:21.893 --> 01:01:23.601
Psilocybin...

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:27.747
...a hallucinogenic property possibly
synthesized from psilocin mushrooms.

01:01:28.216 --> 01:01:31.473
Also two monoamine oxidase inhibitors...

01:01:31.553 --> 01:01:35.075
...and two other as yet unknown ingredients.

01:01:35.155 --> 01:01:39.203
They can isolate and analyze these,
but it will take up to a week.

01:01:42.196 --> 01:01:45.887
It might be worth noting
that in the last seven days...

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:49.324
...Ms. Kane has had three meetings
with Jeannie Callaghan...

01:01:49.404 --> 01:01:52.612
<i>...a close personal friend
with a first in chemistry.</i>

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.099
<i>Do you want me to get the recipe?</i>

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.854
Obviously.

01:02:35.236 --> 01:02:37.606
Mcintyre's heat signal has disappeared.

01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:39.875
Have they got people there?

01:02:39.955 --> 01:02:42.165
Yeah, two minutes away.

01:02:43.658 --> 01:02:46.482
You thought infrared surveillance
would be enough?

01:02:46.912 --> 01:02:49.315
I was told to be discreet.

01:02:51.198 --> 01:02:52.719
If...

01:02:53.049 --> 01:02:56.090
...you're going to survive in intelligence...

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.448
...you'd better develop some.

01:03:05.596 --> 01:03:09.216
He worked for the Ministry
of Defense, you moron.

01:03:09.718 --> 01:03:11.728
He's technically savvy.

01:03:15.439 --> 01:03:19.651
And hang up your fucking jacket.

01:03:24.665 --> 01:03:26.742
I'll go there myself.

01:04:34.241 --> 01:04:36.263
He's long gone.

01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:39.561
Use video analytics
and find out where he went.

01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:41.879
<i>Accessing the A network.</i>

01:05:55.783 --> 01:05:58.240
I thought it would be
good for you to get out...

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.110
...but you must tell me
if you need to spend some time alone.

01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:04.279
I don't want to be alone.

01:06:04.359 --> 01:06:06.247
This is fine, thank you.

01:06:06.327 --> 01:06:09.998
Have you any idea of what thoughts
you were putting into your unconscious?

01:06:10.498 --> 01:06:12.754
I've been hearing whispers.

01:06:13.434 --> 01:06:16.424
When you put that many thoughts
into your unconscious...

01:06:16.504 --> 01:06:19.161
...you must expect some kind of response.

01:06:19.941 --> 01:06:22.834
Hearing voices can be
a sign of schizophrenia.

01:06:22.914 --> 01:06:25.600
That is not something
you need to worry about.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.337
Rosalyn was diagnosed as a child.

01:06:29.217 --> 01:06:31.973
It can lay dormant for decades.

01:06:32.053 --> 01:06:34.343
Does Rosalyn hear whispers?

01:06:35.423 --> 01:06:37.448
I don't know...

01:06:37.528 --> 01:06:39.774
...I haven't seen her in a long time.

01:06:40.427 --> 01:06:44.056
I should've gone,
but I was just too frightened.

01:06:45.699 --> 01:06:48.289
And now my fears seem to be coming true.

01:06:48.369 --> 01:06:52.027
You don't strike me as being
remotely schizophrenic.

01:06:52.107 --> 01:06:55.297
Even now, you're thinking
clearly and cogently.

01:06:55.777 --> 01:06:57.966
You've been through an ordeal.

01:06:58.046 --> 01:07:01.055
It's only natural that you
should be a little traumatized.

01:07:03.184 --> 01:07:05.027
Just try to relax.

01:07:05.352 --> 01:07:07.776
You've been very kind.

01:07:07.856 --> 01:07:09.718
Thank you.

01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:14.219
Nature calls.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:43.841
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:07:49.163 --> 01:07:50.973
What do you want?

01:07:55.469 --> 01:07:58.556
They've screwed with my head,
they've done something to me.

01:08:00.507 --> 01:08:03.920
They brainwashed me, I want you to know.

01:08:05.245 --> 01:08:08.336
- Who's brainwashed you?
- Your boss.

01:08:08.416 --> 01:08:10.660
Your boss and his associates.

01:08:11.768 --> 01:08:13.373
Marvin?

01:08:13.453 --> 01:08:15.264
Why would he do that?

01:08:19.326 --> 01:08:21.381
To eliminate me, perhaps.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:23.473
To eliminate you from what?

01:08:26.033 --> 01:08:30.140
Two men, two men crashed into my flat
and they injected me with something.

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.094
I woke up in alleyway
covered in water and salt...

01:08:33.174 --> 01:08:36.731
...and I've got a three or four
hour gap in my memory.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:40.518
I shook off surveillance, and four
undercover policemen raided my...

01:08:40.598 --> 01:08:42.691
...shed and the park.

01:08:44.718 --> 01:08:47.127
What has this got to do with Marvin?

01:08:49.089 --> 01:08:50.966
He's behind it.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:55.483
- He's behind it.
- Why do you think that?

01:08:58.031 --> 01:09:01.055
When I was doing my research,
I found out some other things.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:06.644
Two weeks ago a high level operation was
launched under Marvin Greenslade's control.

01:09:06.724 --> 01:09:08.595
Protection command are behind it.

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:12.533
That's a special operations directive
of Metropolitan Police.

01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:16.292
It's the same unit that
looks after the PM's security.

01:09:19.897 --> 01:09:21.975
Maybe you're having another breakdown.

01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:28.183
Smelling of booze and hidden in
the ladie's toilets doesn't look good.

01:09:28.263 --> 01:09:30.919
Look at you.
They've done it to you as well...

01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:33.654
...why else would you change
your mind about me so suddenly?

01:09:33.734 --> 01:09:36.424
- Because you lied to me!
- No.

01:09:36.504 --> 01:09:39.794
No, no, no, no, no. I... I didn't lie to you.

01:09:39.874 --> 01:09:44.633
I didn't lie to you! I cut my
brother out of my life because...

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:47.943
...because he... my wife left me for him.

01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:53.694
And I didn't mention my job because
I am trying to forget about it.

01:09:55.289 --> 01:09:58.980
Look at you. Your head's going
one way and your body in another.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.283
You don't know what the fuck's going on,
but you keep pretending that you do.

01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:06.020
They brainwashed you into believing
something that you don't!

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.144
You need to get away from him.

01:10:10.704 --> 01:10:12.193
I can't think straight.

01:10:12.273 --> 01:10:16.485
You can't trust your mind, they've done
something to it so don't think, just feel.

01:10:17.577 --> 01:10:21.012
- Just feel.
- I need time to think.

01:10:28.856 --> 01:10:30.867
Just give me some time.

01:10:33.093 --> 01:10:35.070
I'll call you.

01:10:38.282 --> 01:10:41.328
Call this number, but do it from a pay phone.

01:11:35.722 --> 01:11:37.600
Are you alright, mate?

01:11:43.096 --> 01:11:46.142
Were you trying to top yourself or something?

01:11:53.907 --> 01:11:55.730
Is everything alright?

01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:58.019
I'm fine.

01:12:10.323 --> 01:12:12.929
Don't worry about
what happened this afternoon.

01:12:18.148 --> 01:12:19.992
Just be close to me.

01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:25.048
Physical contact is what you need.

01:12:27.307 --> 01:12:31.387
It'll make your mind work better, I promise.

01:12:35.649 --> 01:12:37.605
Is this alright?

01:12:37.685 --> 01:12:40.175
I don't want to push you into anything.

01:12:40.655 --> 01:12:42.531
It feels nice.

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:45.767
You want me, then?

01:12:47.561 --> 01:12:49.437
It's fine.

01:12:49.763 --> 01:12:52.175
Let me hear you say you want me.

01:12:53.233 --> 01:12:55.077
I do want you.

01:12:56.306 --> 01:12:58.146
Say it again.

01:13:00.073 --> 01:13:01.950
I want you.

01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:01.860
Take the drugs, take the money!
Just take it all.

01:15:04.437 --> 01:15:06.011
This...

01:15:06.743 --> 01:15:08.984
...is the blunt side of the razor.

01:15:11.998 --> 01:15:14.236
If you cooperate with me...

01:15:14.316 --> 01:15:16.756
...and keep what happens here tonight...

01:15:16.836 --> 01:15:19.500
...a complete and absolute secret...

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.990
...I will not harm you.

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:25.734
But if you share this experience...

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:29.097
...even with your God...

01:15:30.457 --> 01:15:32.267
...I will find you...

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.541
...and I will use the sharp side.

01:15:36.537 --> 01:15:38.374
I will use it a lot.

01:15:46.172 --> 01:15:48.483
I'm after a recipe.

01:17:02.045 --> 01:17:04.971
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Bernard.

01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:08.380
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- It's your brother.

01:17:24.738 --> 01:17:27.027
- Hello?
- <i>Finally, for fuck's sake.</i>

01:17:27.107 --> 01:17:29.664
<i>Where are you? Never mind.</i>

01:17:29.744 --> 01:17:33.401
- <i>Meet me at the bar in 40 minutes.</i>
- I'm in London.

01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:36.691
<i>Fine, an hour and 40 minutes. No excuses.</i>

01:18:46.452 --> 01:18:48.697
What the fuck's going on?

01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:53.648
- What are you mixed up in?
- I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:57.418
- Where exactly have you been working, Holly?
- What has that got to do with anything?

01:18:57.498 --> 01:18:59.987
I want to know if it's real.

01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:03.524
It's a warehouse, 8 Dyke Road,
halfway down on the left.

01:19:03.604 --> 01:19:06.293
- Is that real enough for you?
- Are you serious?

01:19:06.373 --> 01:19:10.131
Are really this naive? Do you have any idea
what you've got yourself involved in?

01:19:10.211 --> 01:19:13.701
I can tell you're pissed off about something,
but I really don't need this right now.

01:19:13.781 --> 01:19:15.536
I'll tell you what I don't need, shall I?

01:19:15.616 --> 01:19:18.105
Some creepy little pervert
breaking into my flat...

01:19:18.185 --> 01:19:20.641
...and running a cutthroat
razor blade across my tits...

01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:23.695
...all in the name of extracting
the exact ingredients for a potion...

01:19:23.775 --> 01:19:27.870
...that I gave to you under the strictest
confidence, that's what I don't need!

01:19:31.397 --> 01:19:35.256
Look, they know about me
and they know where I live...

01:19:35.336 --> 01:19:36.981
...so I'm fucked.

01:19:37.704 --> 01:19:40.227
Now did you tell anyone about that?

01:19:40.307 --> 01:19:42.731
- No.
- Then how do they know?

01:19:43.511 --> 01:19:45.053
How?

01:19:45.712 --> 01:19:47.067
I don't know.

01:19:47.147 --> 01:19:49.603
Alright, then back to my original question.

01:19:49.683 --> 01:19:52.727
What are you mixed up in?

01:19:56.606 --> 01:19:58.450
What's going on, Holly?

01:20:00.673 --> 01:20:02.571
What's happened to you?

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:09.090
I'm hearing voices in my head.

01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:12.080
What kind of voices?

01:20:19.178 --> 01:20:20.754
I need to go see my sister.

01:20:20.834 --> 01:20:23.694
About time, but why now?

01:20:24.517 --> 01:20:26.006
I need to ask her something.

01:20:26.086 --> 01:20:30.499
You need to get out of whatever
it is you're mixed up in.

01:20:31.624 --> 01:20:35.214
Look, be careful, alright?

01:20:35.294 --> 01:20:38.318
They're probably watching us now,
and that's not paranoia.

01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:40.418
And if we lose contact...

01:20:40.698 --> 01:20:42.773
...then use my business e-mail.

01:20:43.202 --> 01:20:44.746
Okay?

01:20:49.743 --> 01:20:51.319
Fuck.

01:21:30.316 --> 01:21:31.605
Marvin?

01:21:31.685 --> 01:21:34.129
<i>Holly, what're you up to?</i>

01:21:36.322 --> 01:21:38.412
I'm going to see my sister.

01:21:39.724 --> 01:21:42.537
<i>You must be upset. Are you alright?</i>

01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:46.453
I decided it was time to face my fears.

01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:49.189
<i>Look, why don't you let me come with you.</i>

01:21:49.269 --> 01:21:52.860
<i>You need somebody close to you
at times like these.</i>

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:56.231
That's tempting, but I need to do this alone.

01:21:56.811 --> 01:22:01.601
<i>You are very brave, but will you at least
let me collect you when you're finished?</i>

01:22:01.699 --> 01:22:06.540
<i>After an ordeal like that, you might find
you need someone rational nearby.</i>

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.675
Thank you.

01:22:08.755 --> 01:22:10.833
I'll call you when I'm finished.

01:22:35.014 --> 01:22:37.271
You haven't been here before, have you?

01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:39.195
Not for a very long time.

01:22:42.555 --> 01:22:46.615
I'll wait out here.
Shout if you have any problems.

01:23:27.717 --> 01:23:29.594
Hello, Rosalyn.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.719
I'm sorry I haven't been to see you.

01:23:39.378 --> 01:23:41.298
I need to ask you something.

01:23:41.378 --> 01:23:43.798
Why haven't you come to see me?

01:23:45.184 --> 01:23:49.030
- I was busy.
- Yes, avoiding me.

01:23:53.059 --> 01:23:55.950
Why didn't you come to see me after Mum died?

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:57.618
I don't know.

01:23:57.698 --> 01:24:01.175
I was upset for eight years.

01:24:01.935 --> 01:24:05.603
- I was in therapy.
- Well, we're all in therapy.

01:24:07.807 --> 01:24:10.210
Why didn't you come to see me?

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:13.756
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you come?

01:24:19.502 --> 01:24:21.169
I was afraid.

01:24:22.121 --> 01:24:23.658
Afraid of me?

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:28.236
Afraid of being like you.

01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:32.740
And are you?

01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:35.977
- Like me?
- I don't know.

01:24:39.705 --> 01:24:41.749
Do you hear whispers?

01:24:42.408 --> 01:24:43.718
No.

01:24:44.293 --> 01:24:46.718
- Never?
- No.

01:24:51.951 --> 01:24:54.175
I don't think I am like you.

01:24:54.655 --> 01:24:57.244
Well, it's not so bad really.

01:24:57.674 --> 01:25:01.169
Everything's taken care of,
everything's under control.

01:25:02.029 --> 01:25:03.884
Can I give you a hug?

01:25:04.364 --> 01:25:06.240
I like hugs.

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:40.041
- It's me.
- How are you?

01:25:41.434 --> 01:25:44.524
Surviving. You?

01:25:44.604 --> 01:25:46.692
About the same.

01:25:46.772 --> 01:25:48.862
Look, I'm really sorry.

01:25:48.942 --> 01:25:52.332
No, listen, it's okay.
You can tell me later, yeah?

01:25:52.412 --> 01:25:56.471
Can you get to the Royal Pavilion
in about 45 minutes?

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:59.026
I think so.

01:25:59.285 --> 01:26:01.530
Meet me in the banqueting hall.

01:26:02.889 --> 01:26:05.643
But I need you to do something
for me before you get there.

01:26:06.243 --> 01:26:08.052
Where is she?

01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:13.410
Keep her under close surveillance. I want
to know where she goes and who she meets.

01:27:36.482 --> 01:27:38.905
It's not a CCTV anomaly.

01:27:38.985 --> 01:27:40.741
That's where MacIntyre is.

01:27:41.421 --> 01:27:43.301
<i>Get me eyes inside the Pavilion.</i>

01:28:07.446 --> 01:28:10.323
<i>I don't want Dennis MacIntyre.</i>

01:28:14.653 --> 01:28:16.530
<i>I want Marvin.</i>

01:28:21.193 --> 01:28:23.170
<i>I trust Marvin.</i>

01:28:23.262 --> 01:28:24.806
Holly.

01:28:29.235 --> 01:28:31.011
Holly!

01:28:49.172 --> 01:28:52.055
- You have to leave the country.
- No.

01:28:53.559 --> 01:28:54.848
Why?

01:28:54.928 --> 01:28:56.683
They're obviously brainwashing people.

01:28:56.763 --> 01:29:00.287
I got too close to it and now we've
become part of the experiment.

01:29:00.367 --> 01:29:04.524
Greenslade, he's too close to the PM.
They can't risk this coming out.

01:29:04.604 --> 01:29:08.243
They've got eyes everywhere.
We have to go, and we have to go quickly.

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:35.989
Yes?

01:29:36.069 --> 01:29:39.326
<i>She's being evasive
so it's highly likely she's with him.</i>

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.830
One more session and the beliefs
would have been set in stone.

01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:47.596
<i>We're way past that.
We need to eliminate them.</i>

01:29:48.548 --> 01:29:50.958
Facilitate his suicide...

01:29:52.551 --> 01:29:54.482
...but have her sectioned.

01:29:55.821 --> 01:29:58.445
Her sister is already in an institution.

01:29:59.125 --> 01:30:02.403
It will be a simple matter
to discredit anything she might say.

01:30:32.157 --> 01:30:35.203
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to ask you to take your clothes off.

01:30:36.399 --> 01:30:38.418
It's almost certain they have
a tracking device on you.

01:30:38.498 --> 01:30:40.500
The only way we can be sure
that we're not being monitored...

01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:42.888
...is by leaving everything behind.

01:30:46.038 --> 01:30:47.614
Please.

01:31:18.804 --> 01:31:20.460
I'm not paranoid.

01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:23.752
I know how many resources
they can marshal against us.

01:32:12.491 --> 01:32:14.769
We need to pick something up.

01:32:18.146 --> 01:32:20.487
<i>People in Birch and residents at OP3.</i>

01:32:20.567 --> 01:32:25.054
The drone's infrared sensor
finally paid off. Congratulations.

01:32:25.904 --> 01:32:29.198
- You sure it's both of them in the flat?
- <i>Two heat signals.</i>

01:32:30.143 --> 01:32:32.354
Send a team in, I'm on my way.

01:33:23.195 --> 01:33:25.151
Who the fuck are you?

01:33:25.231 --> 01:33:27.308
I'm Bernard MacIntyre...

01:33:29.017 --> 01:33:31.262
...and this is my lawyer.

01:33:31.937 --> 01:33:35.539
Maud Parsons. Can I see your warrant?

01:33:42.047 --> 01:33:43.858
Just wait.

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:50.711
Get in, get in. It's okay.

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.342
Pull over.

01:34:23.022 --> 01:34:25.433
Pull over just a minute, please.

01:34:29.929 --> 01:34:31.850
Look at me.

01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:33.774
Look at me.

01:34:48.547 --> 01:34:50.358
Thank you.

01:34:52.218 --> 01:34:54.094
Thank you.

01:35:27.236 --> 01:35:30.076
Two seats out on the flight out
of Gatwick in the name MacIntyre?

01:35:30.156 --> 01:35:32.730
How very convenient. Keep looking.

01:35:53.212 --> 01:35:55.869
You sure the car belongs
to Bernard MacIntyre?

01:35:56.466 --> 01:35:58.509
How far down the 827?

01:36:00.118 --> 01:36:01.441
He's heading for Portsmouth.

01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:05.029
Check ferry destinations and times,
and call Border Control.

01:36:15.033 --> 01:36:17.111
Brotherly love.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.275
Are you certain they've already gone through?

01:37:25.138 --> 01:37:26.960
No wonder our borders are porous.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.712
Access the ferry's cameras, I'm almost there.

01:40:15.007 --> 01:40:19.065
<i>I now realize my beliefs
and attitudes were wrong.</i>

01:40:19.745 --> 01:40:23.402
<i>More than anything,
I want to be a productive, loyal...</i>

01:40:23.482 --> 01:40:26.960
<i>...and law abiding citizen
of the United Kingdom.</i>
