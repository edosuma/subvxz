Okay, I locked in a rezzie

09:11.986 --> 09:14.379
You gotta make me
the perfect fishbowl.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.643
We're talking
three dragons minimum.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.079
I got this, Klaus.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.254

George R.R. Martin over here!

10:02.036 --> 10:04.691
I need this to be
a panty-melter, bro-ham.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.475
Do it again!

10:07.737 --> 10:10.000
Tonight was magical, my love.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.437
I feel like Cinderella.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.526
You look like Cinderella, too.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.963
Like in your face.

10:16.006 --> 10:17.529
[both moaning]

10:17.573 --> 10:19.793
I worked up a sweat,
and I need to run my balls

10:19.836 --> 10:22.056

then let's make sweet love.

10:22.099 --> 10:24.101

Now I know I'm in a fairytale.

HENDERSON:
How was dancing?

10:33.545 --> 10:35.025
[gasps] Henderson!

10:35.069 --> 10:36.897
What are you doing
in my bathroom?

10:36.940 --> 10:38.420
Eating an apple.

10:38.463 --> 10:41.423
I mean <i>why</i> are you doing
in my bathroom?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.251
Waiting for my next assignment.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.426
And payment.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.602
There is no next assignment!

10:46.646 --> 10:48.735
Our business arrangement
is over.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.259
Marriage rekindled!
Mission accomplished!

10:51.302 --> 10:55.132
Then I guess I should tell Stan
everything and crush him.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.395
It'll probably end
your marriage.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.049
[gasps]

10:59.093 --> 11:00.050
[door slams]

11:00.094 --> 11:01.878
Francine?

11:01.922 --> 11:04.228
I think you're gonna like this!

11:04.272 --> 11:06.709
- Guess what I am?
- I need to come clean.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.928
Guess, Francine.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.320
Sex gargoyle?

11:09.364 --> 11:12.541
Nope. Horse statue
outside PF Chang's,

11:12.584 --> 11:15.457
A.K.A. your favorite
statue in the world.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.415
You remembered!

11:17.459 --> 11:20.070
Oh, you're making this so hard.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.682
Stan, there is something
you need to know.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.945
Hold that thought while
I come clean about something.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.730
It wasn't my idea
to take you dancing.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.123
[inhales deeply]

11:29.166 --> 11:32.866
I have an imaginary friend
named Henderson.

11:32.909 --> 11:36.130
He made me realize
that you are my everything,

11:36.173 --> 11:38.523
and I never want to drift apart.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.090
You were about to
confess something?

11:40.134 --> 11:41.701
Oh, wow.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.051
Stan, I...

11:44.094 --> 11:46.662
once bought a bunch
of 9th graders beer

11:46.706 --> 11:48.620
at a Blues Traveler concert.

11:48.664 --> 11:51.319
Sounds like you're only
confessing to one thing...

11:51.362 --> 11:53.234
being a super cool lady.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.411
Well, take some advice
from a super cool lady.

11:56.454 --> 12:00.284
Stan, get rid of
your imaginary friend.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.112
He's not real!

12:02.156 --> 12:03.548
But I am.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.463
Who's Henderson?

12:05.507 --> 12:06.943
I know you didn't say
"Henderson,"

12:06.987 --> 12:09.206
so that didn't totally work,
but you get the idea.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.861
So just to clarify,
you're getting rid of Henderson?

12:11.905 --> 12:13.167
Who's Henderson?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.346
[gasps]
There's paper on me!

12:18.389 --> 12:19.739
Get it off!
Get it off!

12:19.782 --> 12:22.393
Don't move, Mom!
It's stuck to your face!

12:22.437 --> 12:23.743
It's paper!

12:23.786 --> 12:25.092
<i>[line ringing]</i>

12:27.181 --> 12:30.097
Well, here's the problem.
It's paper.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.795
Oh. It's a love note
from Stan.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.232
"I took Henderson skydiving.

12:35.276 --> 12:39.323
He came from the heavens,
and thither he shall return.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.978
Text if you need tampons,
my queen."

12:42.022 --> 12:43.110
- Aww.
- Aww.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.198
Oh, no!

12:46.766 --> 12:47.854
[button clicks]

12:47.897 --> 12:49.072
- [wind whistles]
- Uh.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.291
What's happening?

12:50.334 --> 12:52.902
When do I get my parachute?

12:52.946 --> 12:56.427
You were the greatest friend
a boy could ask for,

12:56.471 --> 13:00.257
but when a boy marries a girl,
he doesn't need friends.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.476
I realize that now.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.870
I-I'm scared, Stan.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.959
I want to go back down
to the ground!

13:06.002 --> 13:08.091
You can go wherever you want.

13:08.135 --> 13:09.876
You're imaginary.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.486
What the hell are you doing?

13:11.529 --> 13:13.096
It's time for you to help some

13:13.140 --> 13:15.446
other boy the way you helped me.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.361
I wasn't helping!

13:17.405 --> 13:20.234
Your dad hired me
because he didn't love you!

13:20.277 --> 13:22.540
My imagination is so powerful!

13:22.584 --> 13:23.890
This must be what Jim Henson

13:23.933 --> 13:26.066
felt like wrestling
with his ideas.

13:26.109 --> 13:27.850
I'm a real man!

13:27.894 --> 13:29.330
My name is Hank Henderson,

13:29.373 --> 13:31.898
and I live in
Flagstaff, Arizona.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.030
You showed me your cards,
Henderson.

13:34.074 --> 13:36.250
Even I know that's not
a real place.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.338
Goodbye, Henderson,

13:37.381 --> 13:40.645
- and thank you!
- [screams]

13:42.386 --> 13:44.432
Come on, Stan.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.390
Don't do anything stupid.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.958
- [splat]
- [screams, tires screech]

13:50.873 --> 13:51.961
Francine?

13:52.005 --> 13:53.528
No freaking way.

13:53.571 --> 13:54.921
You're never gonna believe this.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.053
Henderson landed on your car!

13:57.097 --> 14:01.144
Huh. I figured he would
disappear or something.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.711
Realistic as hell.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.669
My brain is a marvel.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.864
Good thing you can't see this.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.324
You'd be, like, freaking out.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.717
[whimpers]

14:08.760 --> 14:11.763
There's that super cool
lady I know and love.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.635
Want to go dancing?

14:16.725 --> 14:18.509
I have the strangest feeling,

14:18.553 --> 14:20.642
but I can't put my finger on it.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.821
Stan, I need you to listen to me

14:25.865 --> 14:26.996
without interrupting.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.432
I live to serve you.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.652
Henderson was hired by your dad

14:30.695 --> 14:33.524
to be your imaginary friend.

14:33.568 --> 14:37.877
That guy on the hood
is an actual dead man.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.139
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.880
Oh, my God.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.403
Oh, my God!

14:42.446 --> 14:44.927
My own father?
What a great guy!

14:44.971 --> 14:46.146
What?!

14:46.189 --> 14:48.931
He hired a man to be
my imaginary friend

14:48.975 --> 14:50.715
because he couldn't be there.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.195
No!

14:52.239 --> 14:55.590
He lied to you,
and I lied to you.

14:55.633 --> 14:59.855
I paid Henderson to manipulate
you into taking me dancing.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.509
I murdered a man.

15:01.552 --> 15:05.426
No. All you did was save
our marriage.

15:05.469 --> 15:06.470
Mind pumping the brakes?

15:06.514 --> 15:07.558
[tires squeal]

15:07.602 --> 15:09.169
[squeaks, thuds]

15:09.212 --> 15:11.040
Just drive around that guy.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.960
The reservation
is in 20 minutes!

15:18.004 --> 15:19.701
What the hell
is taking so long?!

15:19.744 --> 15:21.442
All of your design notes!

15:21.485 --> 15:23.270
I wouldn't <i>have</i> notes
if you did it right

15:23.313 --> 15:24.793
the first time!

15:24.836 --> 15:27.491
How hard is it to make
a fishbowl with one mongoose,

15:27.535 --> 15:28.666
two Pickle Ricks,

15:28.710 --> 15:30.973
and Kawhi Leonard
in a Knicks jersey?

15:31.017 --> 15:33.976
[fire crackles]

15:34.020 --> 15:35.369
Let's go!

15:35.412 --> 15:37.806
That glass is over
1,000 degrees.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.721
- It needs to cool.
- There's no time.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.549
We'll crank the van's A/C.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.246
To Ruby Tuesday's!

15:45.466 --> 15:47.424
Danuta. Sorry I'm late.
Better late than never.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.773
[laughs]

15:48.817 --> 15:51.689
Klaus, wow.
You look great.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.213
Is that a new fish bowl?

15:53.256 --> 15:54.605
- [laughs]
- [sizzling]

15:54.649 --> 15:55.843
I hope we're in
the smoking section.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.392
[chuckles] Waiter!
Ice water immediately!

15:58.435 --> 16:00.176
- And for you?
- Hmm.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.744
I'll take... hmm.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.267
[laughs]

16:04.311 --> 16:06.313
Let's make that order <i>
two</i> ice waters. [laughs]

16:06.356 --> 16:07.705
I'll take a Chardonnay.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.665
You heard the lady.
[laughs] Hurry! [laughs]

16:10.708 --> 16:12.362
Ooh, wait.
On second thought,

16:12.406 --> 16:14.016
I'm coming off
a bad relationship,

16:14.060 --> 16:17.324
and I feel like a dirty martini.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.021
[laughs]

16:19.065 --> 16:20.327
[sizzling]

16:20.370 --> 16:23.069
[laughing]

16:23.895 --> 16:27.073
Danuta! Come with me to
the center of the Earth!

16:27.116 --> 16:30.163
[laughs]

16:32.730 --> 16:33.818
[gasps]

16:33.862 --> 16:35.995
Buddy, you're back!
You overheated!

16:36.038 --> 16:37.735
W-What happened to Danuta?

16:37.779 --> 16:39.650
She got a bacon bleu
cheese burger,

16:39.694 --> 16:42.218
but it was so big,
she dislocated her jaw

16:42.262 --> 16:45.047
trying to take a bite,
and now she's at the hospital

16:45.091 --> 16:47.267
and might be dead.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.573
Where's that burger?
Did she finish it?

16:52.098 --> 16:54.056
Can't believe
it's already Monday.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.666
What did we even
do this weekend?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.059
We killed Henderson.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.495
Oh, yeah.
That was crazy.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.149
How are you okay with this?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.673
A man is dead because of us.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.173
If you're worried
about getting caught,

17:04.197 --> 17:06.199
Dick already wiped Henderson
off the grid.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.027
As far as the government
is concerned,

17:08.070 --> 17:10.638
he really <i>was</i> imaginary.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.033
Whoa.
Forgot how to wink.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.731
I'll never be the same.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.820
[sobs]

17:18.863 --> 17:20.517
Come to work with me, honey.

17:20.561 --> 17:23.694
Our grief counselor works
with PTSD every day.

17:26.654 --> 17:27.872
[knock on door]

17:27.916 --> 17:30.049
Go away!

17:30.092 --> 17:31.441
Who are you?

17:31.485 --> 17:34.618
I'm Coach Cathy,
the CIA grief counselor

17:34.662 --> 17:36.838
and coach of our softball team.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.013
Stan sent me.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.928
You can't help me.

17:39.971 --> 17:43.149
Oh-ho, you sound like
Tina Turbaco.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.021
She was depressed she couldn't
hit an inside curve ball.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.588
Uh, who? What?

17:47.631 --> 17:50.591
Okay, let's see what
we're working with here.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.941
Ooh, still in your robe
at 4:00 P.M.?

17:52.984 --> 17:56.597
Drinking... [sniffs]
Popov from a coffee cup.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.773
Ooh, and an ass that
could stop a Mack truck.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.079
Thank you?

18:00.122 --> 18:01.123
How you holding up?

18:01.167 --> 18:03.604
Bad! I killed a man.
