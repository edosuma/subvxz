WEBVTT

00:07.716 --> 00:09.217
My apologies for the wait.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.097
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:22.522 --> 00:27.068
I see. Goldfish require a lot of care.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.194
Yes.

00:28.278 --> 00:32.198
But the more you care for them,
the cuter they start to look.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.993
You think I can handle it?

00:35.076 --> 00:36.161
Of course.

00:36.786 --> 00:40.457
But if you run into any trouble,
we're always here to help.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.959
- There's no need to worry.
- Right.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.423
- They're so cute.
- Indeed.

00:48.506 --> 00:51.259
We're seeing more women
among our customers lately.

00:51.843 --> 00:52.761
Really?

00:52.844 --> 00:54.846
Perhaps you make this place more inviting.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.599
That's not it. It's just a coincidence.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.523
Time for dinner.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.079
Hello, welcome.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.587
I'm Masako Bando. Is Haruto here?

01:29.255 --> 01:30.298
Haru…

01:31.341 --> 01:32.425
Masako.

01:33.718 --> 01:34.928
It's been a while.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.224
It has.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.309
You're looking good.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.065
There's something I'd like to talk about.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.276
Can we speak alone?

01:54.614 --> 01:55.615
Sakura,

01:57.117 --> 01:58.827
is it all right if I step away?

02:00.203 --> 02:01.037
Yeah.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.373
Come in.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.333
Thanks.

02:18.513 --> 02:22.684
I'm here today as the legal advisor
on behalf of Kazama Holdings.

02:25.311 --> 02:31.067
Your father… I mean, the CEO is
requesting your presence at home.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.241
The thing is, the other day,

02:39.200 --> 02:42.829
Sakura Hiraga's husband came to visit.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.623
What?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.417
ANONYMOUS NO. 582
APT 4501 SAKURA HIRAGA

02:47.500 --> 02:50.670
My son moved out seven years ago.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.883
He no longer has any affiliation
with the Kazama family.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.385
I see.

02:58.303 --> 03:03.141
However, it may not appear that way
to the public.

03:06.269 --> 03:10.106
Are you trying to intimidate me for money?

03:10.899 --> 03:12.150
By no means.

03:13.526 --> 03:18.489
I just thought you should know the facts.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.748
I'll come by again.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.049
Takuya and Sakura Hiraga are

03:36.132 --> 03:38.843
a high-profile couple
with plenty of media exposure.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.223
If this comes out,
people will make a big deal about it.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.729
Don't you know?

04:03.952 --> 04:04.953
GRAND OPEN IN OMOTESANDO

04:05.036 --> 04:06.037
COUPLE OPERATES SALON

04:06.120 --> 04:07.080
UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE

04:09.707 --> 04:10.750
CHARISMATIC HAIRDRESSER

04:10.833 --> 04:12.043
COUPLE SUPPORTS EACH OTHER…

04:18.132 --> 04:23.388
She once led a glamorous life. You think
tending to goldfish can fulfill her?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.975
I don't want to say this,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.603
but I don't think it's going
to last anyway.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.696
Sakura is not like you.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.869
You've only known her for a few months.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.415
You don't know anything about her.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.003
That's not it.

04:56.129 --> 04:56.963
Huh?

04:59.048 --> 05:00.216
Sakura is…

05:09.726 --> 05:10.935
She's

05:12.395 --> 05:13.813
a special person.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.070
But she's married.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.782
What's your plan?

05:24.866 --> 05:27.035
You know you can't keep living like this.

05:34.417 --> 05:38.129
At any rate,
think about it and get back to me.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.063
ONE HOUR EARLIER

06:42.443 --> 06:44.445
Hey, Puu, wait!

06:51.702 --> 06:54.163
Huh? There, there.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.582
What's the matter?

06:56.666 --> 06:59.001
Puu! How could you!

07:01.003 --> 07:03.714
I'm sorry for bothering you.

07:09.345 --> 07:13.099
That's my dog.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.727
Is that so?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.230
So sorry to bother you.

07:19.313 --> 07:23.025
Not at all. The tower condo. Over there.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.070
You live there, don't you?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.490
Yes, I do, but…

07:31.117 --> 07:32.952
Have we met before?

07:33.911 --> 07:34.871
Well, no.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.292
It's just that I've seen you around.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.930
Puu, come here.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.228
Honestly, I'm a little surprised.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.648
She hasn't taken to anyone
other than my husband and son.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.651
Your husband?

08:08.988 --> 08:11.657
You're married?

08:12.241 --> 08:13.117
Yes.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.039
What is your husband like?

08:21.667 --> 08:24.003
Why do you ask?

08:25.296 --> 08:27.507
It's nothing, I'm sorry.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.304
My husband is the CEO of a company.

08:35.264 --> 08:38.601
He's quite busy, always traveling.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.315
He hardly ever… comes home.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.274
What's wrong?

08:46.150 --> 08:47.527
Wait, are you okay?

08:47.610 --> 08:48.444
My head…

08:49.362 --> 08:51.572
- Let's rest somewhere.
- My head hurts!

08:51.656 --> 08:53.282
My house is nearby. Are you okay?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.825
It hurts…

08:58.371 --> 08:59.372
Here you are.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.291
Thank you.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.390
A goldfish.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.894
We have one too.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.983
Is that so?

09:30.695 --> 09:34.198
It's just, I get lonely by myself.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.248
I'm Hisako Taguchi.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.209
What?

09:50.965 --> 09:52.049
I'm Baba.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.428
Do you have any family, Baba?

09:57.054 --> 09:58.055
No, I don't.

10:00.391 --> 10:05.646
I used to live with my family
in a high-rise once.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.818
But I was kicked out
and now I'm on my own.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.655
- Kicked out?
- Yes.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.910
She found out I'd cheated.

10:24.540 --> 10:28.419
I lost my family and job
for a fleeting moment of pleasure.

10:29.003 --> 10:33.257
I regret it, but it's too late now.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.177
An affair…

10:42.808 --> 10:43.851
Are you okay?

10:44.894 --> 10:46.354
- Hisako?
- It hurts.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.396
Are you okay?

13:46.158 --> 13:48.160
Wait! Stop!

13:49.662 --> 13:52.164
I have a husband and a son.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.875
- I can't do this. Let go.
- Hisako…

13:58.379 --> 14:00.923
Please visit again. I'll be waiting.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.955
TOYODA GOLDFISH

14:42.548 --> 14:44.925
MASAKO

14:45.009 --> 14:46.051
Masako.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.064
- I'll take this really quick.
- Yeah.

15:05.446 --> 15:09.033
Any new thoughts on what we talked about?

15:09.617 --> 15:10.951
You should know.

15:12.828 --> 15:13.829
Back then…

15:15.831 --> 15:18.417
I decided I would never return
to that house.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.878
You did, but…

15:22.212 --> 15:23.631
About Sakura and me,

15:24.757 --> 15:27.843
I'll figure things out
without causing trouble for the family.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.929
Please relay that to my father.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.515
Bye.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.900
But she's married.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.903
You can't keep living like this.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.911
Sakura hasn't returned home.

15:53.994 --> 15:57.206
I know. Don't they run the salon together?

15:57.289 --> 15:59.249
What will happen if they get divorced?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.876
Well, she'd have to quit.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.504
She has to pay the consequences
for the affair.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.090
What do you think the other man was like?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.676
From the photo, he looked young.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.929
I'm sorry.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.891
My head is aching.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.102
Sorry to cut things short.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.312
- Another migraine?
- I'm sorry.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.563
Take care.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.069
Hisako doesn't handle these topics well.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.113
She's very straightlaced.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.654
You're right.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.451
We shouldn't go there anymore.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.783
I'm home.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.869
Welcome home.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.163
What's wrong?

19:25.122 --> 19:26.456
Does your head hurt again?

19:28.041 --> 19:29.793
No, I'm fine.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.297
I'll make dinner right away.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.064
Hello.

19:52.816 --> 19:53.692
Hello.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.614
- He's upstairs. I'll get him for you.
- It's fine.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.911
I heard that Masako came here.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.666
Masako is my brother's ex-girlfriend.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.424
She's my father's legal advisor.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.469
My father really likes her.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.765
I thought it'd be great
if they got married as well.

20:27.809 --> 20:31.271
But when my brother suddenly said
he would quit the company,

20:32.439 --> 20:34.066
she dumped him.

20:35.859 --> 20:39.363
After that,
he pined after her for a long time.

20:40.781 --> 20:45.577
So this is a chance
for the two of them to try again.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.295
Don't you think it's about time you left?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.174
That would be the best for my brother.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.637
Bye.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.997
Are you ready, Ms. Taguchi?

21:30.080 --> 21:31.540
Yes, please.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.792
Three,

21:34.543 --> 21:35.419
two,

21:36.086 --> 21:36.920
one.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.925
Okay! That's all of it.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.345
Is this your first time
getting a Brazilian?

21:45.929 --> 21:46.888
Yes.

21:46.972 --> 21:50.183
Well, I do think removing the hair

21:50.767 --> 21:53.895
can make things easier to maintain.

21:57.149 --> 22:01.903
Some clients confess
that they're doing it for an affair.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.865
What?

22:04.948 --> 22:07.951
They say their boyfriends like
that it's easier to go down on them.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.706
I'm sorry. What am I saying?

22:14.291 --> 22:17.169
- Infidelity is unforgivable!
- What?

22:17.252 --> 22:19.004
Giving into to desire,

22:19.087 --> 22:22.466
only to lose everything you've
worked hard to build. That's absurd.

22:24.343 --> 22:29.973
I couldn't live… if I ever lost my son.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.734
Okay.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.487
Okay.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.825
Thank you for coming in.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.453
We look forward to seeing you again.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.252
She seems so serious.
Surely she's not cheating?

22:59.336 --> 23:02.297
No, she most certainly is cheating.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.759
A personality like hers is most
susceptible to getting caught up in it.

23:16.394 --> 23:17.854
Don't stare so much.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.551
TOYODA GOLDFISH

24:33.471 --> 24:34.764
Excuse me?

24:36.600 --> 24:39.477
- Hello?
- Yes, what can I do for you?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.689
Where can I find this goldfish?

24:42.772 --> 24:43.899
GOLDFISH_OTAKU

24:43.982 --> 24:45.192
Yes, right over here.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.154
But she's married.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.448
You can't keep living like this.

25:04.753 --> 25:08.298
Hey, did the treatment compound arrive?

25:09.090 --> 25:09.925
What?

25:10.008 --> 25:12.093
The catechin. You said you'd buy more.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.387
I forgot.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.181
I'll go buy it now.

25:16.264 --> 25:17.891
No, it's okay. I'll go.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.976
I want to shop for dinner as well.

25:20.518 --> 25:21.561
Sorry.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.105
No, it's okay. I'll be back.

25:36.117 --> 25:39.120
After that,
he pined after her for a long time.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.791
So this is a chance
for the two of them to try again.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.217
Don't you think it's about time you left?

25:52.300 --> 25:54.261
That would be the best for my brother.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.035
In my mind,

26:19.869 --> 26:23.707
I know that infidelity
is absolutely wrong.

26:25.041 --> 26:26.042
But

26:27.502 --> 26:29.254
when that man touches me…

26:30.880 --> 26:32.590
When Baba touches me,

26:33.967 --> 26:35.719
my body desires him

26:37.178 --> 26:39.514
against my wishes.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.562
It's like I'm…

26:47.772 --> 26:49.232
I'm not myself anymore.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.319
The headaches seem very hard on you.

26:53.153 --> 26:53.987
Yes.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.449
I saw a doctor,
but they're not sure what causes it.

27:00.035 --> 27:03.079
The body is very honest.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.166
Both pain and pleasure

27:06.249 --> 27:08.668
are trying to signal a message to you.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.962
A message?

27:12.756 --> 27:15.258
You're an earnest person,

27:16.426 --> 27:20.930
and that lends itself to
a tendency to suppress how you feel.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.351
You must hold onto a lot of stress?

27:26.269 --> 27:28.021
HISAKO TAGUCHI
JULY 7, 1984 SAT.

27:28.104 --> 27:32.650
Nothing can be solved
if you ignore these emotional messages.

27:44.954 --> 27:45.997
I'm back.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.500
I did a little side errand, so I'm late.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.460
- A side errand?
- Yeah.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.670
I bought these.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.177
What made you buy shears
all of the sudden?

28:00.553 --> 28:01.471
Well…

28:02.972 --> 28:04.516
It was just a feeling.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.111
A long time ago,

28:17.445 --> 28:23.326
I used to work in a salon
as a hairdresser.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.748
When people get a haircut,
it doesn't just change their looks.

28:28.832 --> 28:31.251
It changes how they feel, you know?

28:32.585 --> 28:33.795
Like for example,

28:35.213 --> 28:36.631
they might be heartbroken

28:38.758 --> 28:40.927
or they might be depressed from work.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.723
But after a haircut,
they feel they can let things go,

28:45.765 --> 28:47.767
and strangely enough,
they start to feel better.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.397
I love being a part of that.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.860
It made me very happy.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.866
But because of the accident,

29:04.033 --> 29:06.453
my fingers don't move as well now.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.461
To be honest,

29:15.086 --> 29:19.549
when I was helping at my husband's salon,
I really wanted to cut hair.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.384
And I still feel that way.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.304
But that wasn't possible.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.099
Whenever I held my shears,

29:29.350 --> 29:30.935
I would get sad.

29:32.812 --> 29:36.608
So I avoided touching them
as much as possible.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.784
So it was because of that accident

29:48.244 --> 29:50.163
that you stopped cutting hair?

29:53.583 --> 29:57.670
But as you can see now,
I can hold my shears again.

30:02.258 --> 30:06.221
It's thanks to you, Haruto.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.643
Thank you.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.939
Okay, all done!

30:23.238 --> 30:24.280
Here.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.866
Thank you so much.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.161
I should clean up the hair.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.278
What's wrong?

31:47.989 --> 31:49.365
You still can't?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.418
Sakura is not coming back.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.921
So just forget about her.

32:03.838 --> 32:04.964
Damn it.

32:08.509 --> 32:09.928
My sincere apologies.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.765
I wasn't able to persuade him.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.435
I see.

32:20.146 --> 32:23.024
Perhaps he's still afraid.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.032
To face you.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.540
TOYODA GOLDFISH

32:49.258 --> 32:50.218
Welcome…

33:01.854 --> 33:02.730
Dad!

33:09.195 --> 33:10.363
So it's you?

33:16.703 --> 33:21.290
I have no intention of telling you
what to do with your life.

33:24.085 --> 33:29.090
Do what you want, be it running
a goldfish shop or having an affair.

33:30.883 --> 33:36.264
But it's a different matter
if it brings harm to the company.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.309
Even if you've left the family,

33:40.977 --> 33:44.272
the fact is that you are
the eldest son of the Kazama family.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.608
Don't you understand that?

33:55.491 --> 33:56.826
Haven't you told her?

34:00.747 --> 34:03.041
Sakura, please go upstairs.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.501
No, please remain here.

34:09.922 --> 34:15.011
Takuya Hiraga showed up unannounced
at the CEO's residence.

34:16.262 --> 34:19.307
He said that he was upset
because you are involved with his wife.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.936
I heard that you want
to solve this on your own

34:24.020 --> 34:27.190
and promised not to cause
any inconvenience to the family.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.775
How are you going to resolve this?

34:34.822 --> 34:37.742
What's wrong? Tell me.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.429
Forget it. I'll handle this matter.

35:02.892 --> 35:06.646
So in the end,
you're choosing to run away again.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.025
You haven't changed.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.619
Please wait a moment.

35:29.752 --> 35:34.090
Haruto helped me
when I had no place to go.

35:34.173 --> 35:38.928
Even now,
he's only thinking of my wellbeing.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.973
He hasn't done anything wrong.
If anything…

35:44.684 --> 35:48.479
I was wrong for taking advantage
of his kindness.

35:50.815 --> 35:51.941
So…

35:57.155 --> 35:58.156
And so…

36:00.283 --> 36:01.576
I'll leave.

36:03.536 --> 36:07.373
I won't… see Haruto again.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.375
- Sakura--
- I'm sorry.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.671
Things have gotten out of hand.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.342
But I'll be okay.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.179
Don't worry about me.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.773
Just to clarify, you were not serious

36:33.482 --> 36:36.861
about being with my son. Is that correct?

36:48.039 --> 36:48.915
Yes.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.795
I'm old enough to know better,

36:58.674 --> 37:00.509
but I've done something stupid.

37:08.476 --> 37:13.648
I apologize
for all the trouble I've caused.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.135
Thank you…

38:28.139 --> 38:29.223
for all you've done.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.147
Take care of yourself.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.690
So she's gone.

39:21.984 --> 39:25.237
Which means
she really wasn't serious about you.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.075
That's a load off my mind!

39:29.158 --> 39:30.659
Stop it. Don't talk like that.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.370
- But it's true!
- It's not.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.788
Then why didn't you stop her?

39:34.580 --> 39:36.749
If you really love her,
you wouldn't let her go.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.627
In the end,
you weren't serious about her either--

39:39.710 --> 39:41.045
That's not it!

39:46.467 --> 39:47.468
I'm not…

39:51.472 --> 39:52.932
It's not my place to stop her.

39:54.725 --> 39:55.851
What do you mean?

39:57.770 --> 39:59.438
- Wait here, okay?
- Okay.

40:03.984 --> 40:04.944
I'm sorry.

40:05.027 --> 40:06.487
No, I'm sorry.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.326
Here you are.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.203
Thank you.

40:14.286 --> 40:15.413
Look out!

40:52.074 --> 40:54.994
No way. That was her?

40:57.913 --> 40:59.123
In that moment,

41:00.958 --> 41:02.334
I couldn't move.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.505
Because I couldn't do anything…

41:09.925 --> 41:11.510
Because of that, Sakura…

41:18.100 --> 41:20.436
What right do I have to be with her?

41:26.942 --> 41:28.694
I'm not worthy…

41:31.697 --> 41:32.990
to even desire that.

42:13.155 --> 42:15.449
I'll always be by your side.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.358
Goldfish are tough.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.318
Even if they jump out of the fishbowl,

42:51.902 --> 42:53.612
they have the strength to keep swimming.

42:53.696 --> 42:56.949
That's what I love about goldfish.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.542
I never should have let you go.
