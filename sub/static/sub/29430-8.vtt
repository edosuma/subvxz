There's an opening right here
I think we can fill.

fill it.

Yeah, night time.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.583
How about the 27th, then,
that's a full moon?

Ooh, yeah!

21:22.411 --> 21:24.457
I'll close the store
on the 28th.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.589
You might want to knock off
the 29th, too.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.329
Just as a back-up plan.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.374
You should pardon
the expression.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.984
Ooh! Pardon it?

21:30.027 --> 21:31.812
I ain't pardon nothing!

Are you kidding me?
