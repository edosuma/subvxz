WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:03.416
I gotta get goin'

00:03.416 --> 00:07.000
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.416
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.083 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:20.958
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.125
we're so adventurous

00:28.125 --> 00:31.250
and again

00:31.250 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.333
to count on a friend

00:38.333 --> 00:41.875
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.375
take me, please?

00:45.375 --> 00:48.750
I got to be there

00:50.750 --> 00:56.000
Winnie the Pooh

01:11.458 --> 01:13.125
Rabbit: Ya-ha-ha-ha!

01:13.125 --> 01:16.583
Oh, no, you don't,
you miserable millipedes.

01:16.583 --> 01:19.833
Take that, you bugs,
and that.

01:19.833 --> 01:22.000
This means war.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.333
Retreat! Retreat!

01:27.708 --> 01:30.333
Had enough, eh?

01:30.333 --> 01:33.708
Well, that'll teach you
to mess with my vegetables.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.583
Uh-oh.

01:49.583 --> 01:50.708
Fire!

01:50.708 --> 01:52.166
Aah!

01:53.625 --> 01:57.583
Another wild party
at Rabbit's house.

01:57.583 --> 02:00.875
Guess I'm not fun enough
to be invited.

02:00.875 --> 02:04.000
Maybe I should
work on my image.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.291
Let's see.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.875
Smile's still like new.

02:09.875 --> 02:12.208
Hardly ever use it.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.875
Now!

02:15.125 --> 02:16.875
Eeyore: Oh, I see.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.250
It's a dance party.

02:19.250 --> 02:22.083
Don't know what
the problem is, then.

02:22.083 --> 02:26.291
Got twice as many feet
to dance with as most folks.

02:27.875 --> 02:29.583
I think I got it.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.125
I think I--

02:31.125 --> 02:32.708
Hawmp!

02:32.708 --> 02:34.458
What happened?

02:36.250 --> 02:38.333
You again.

02:38.333 --> 02:40.833
You're what's holding me back.

02:40.833 --> 02:43.708
Always tagging along,

02:43.708 --> 02:45.958
getting me into trouble.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.583
I think we've come

02:48.583 --> 02:51.291
to the tail end
of our relationship.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.416
What do you know?

02:53.416 --> 02:56.708
Feel like the life
of the party already.

03:00.458 --> 03:01.708
Ah!

03:01.708 --> 03:03.291
All right, you pests,

03:03.291 --> 03:05.083
it's payback time.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.166
Ah-choo!

03:11.583 --> 03:14.875
Where did those little
bugbarians go?

03:16.958 --> 03:18.583
Aha!

03:18.583 --> 03:20.625
Tell me where
your friends are,

03:20.625 --> 03:23.375
or I'll spray you
into next year.

03:23.375 --> 03:25.333
Behind me? Ha ha.

03:25.333 --> 03:28.458
You don't expect me to fall
for that old trick, do you?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.583
Yaah-hee-hee-hee-hee!

03:33.833 --> 03:36.833
Uch. Now that's what I
call dirty fighting.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.208
Oh, dear.

03:41.291 --> 03:42.458
Oh, dearie, dear.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.625
Don't come any closer.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.458
I've got this, uh,
whatchamacallit.

03:47.458 --> 03:48.625
And halt!

03:53.500 --> 03:55.291
Mm! Ah!

03:55.291 --> 03:58.125
- Mm. This gives me an idea.

03:58.125 --> 04:00.833
Might be more popular,

04:00.833 --> 04:03.875
but part of me
is a lot colder.

04:03.875 --> 04:07.125
Wonder if anyone's
even gonna notice.

04:07.125 --> 04:08.208
Mmmf!

04:08.208 --> 04:09.375
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:09.375 --> 04:10.958
Hiya, donkey boy!

04:10.958 --> 04:13.750
Say, I almost didn't
recoganize you

04:13.750 --> 04:15.125
without your tail.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.875
We parted company
at Rabbit's.

04:17.875 --> 04:20.458
I'm much happier
without it.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.166
Can't you tell?

04:22.166 --> 04:23.500
Sure, sure.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.000
Only how will you
be able

04:25.000 --> 04:26.833
to tell your front
from your back?

04:26.833 --> 04:29.500
My tail always
took care of that.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.875
And since you're always
saying you're such a nobody,

04:31.875 --> 04:34.458
uh, won't you be
even less of a somebody

04:34.458 --> 04:35.875
with part of your
body missing?

04:35.875 --> 04:38.333
A tail's more
than just a tail, you know.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.416
It's a friend
who's always there

04:40.416 --> 04:41.875
to back you up
when you need it.

04:41.875 --> 04:44.208
You're right, Tigger.

04:44.208 --> 04:48.083
How will I ever get
the little guy back?

04:48.083 --> 04:49.375
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:49.375 --> 04:51.458
You asked the right tigger.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.875
Ta-da!

04:52.875 --> 04:54.000
Stand up, pal,

04:54.000 --> 04:55.875
and slap a grin
on that face.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.000
Because Tigger, Private Ear,
is hot on your case.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.583
And take it from me,

05:02.583 --> 05:05.875
reuniting loved ones is
what us private ears do best.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.416
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

05:08.875 --> 05:12.291
Now that's what I call
a worm wrangler.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.875
Sometimes I amaze
even myself.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.250
Whee-hoo!

05:26.500 --> 05:30.125
All aboard for the
Dreamboat Island Cruise.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.625
Step lively now.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.375
Okay! Yahoo!

05:33.375 --> 05:36.208
Goodbye.
Have a wonderful trip.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.583
Ha ha ha ha!

05:37.583 --> 05:39.708
You vicious vermin.

05:39.708 --> 05:43.250
Now they'll be seasick
instead of lovesick.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.166
Bon voyage.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.333
Hello, Pooh Bear.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.000
Hello, Rabbit.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.958
I've come to see you,

05:51.958 --> 05:54.333
but you don't seem
to be home.

05:54.333 --> 05:58.291
What can I do for you
on this wonderful day, Pooh?

05:58.291 --> 06:00.625
Want to borrow some honey?
Break my china?

06:00.625 --> 06:03.000
Tie my ears in a knot?
Ha ha ha ha ha!

06:03.000 --> 06:07.375
Oh, I don't think I want
anything as important
as those things.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.708
Uh, what's that, Rabbit?

06:09.708 --> 06:12.291
Oh. Uh, why, this old thing?

06:12.291 --> 06:13.708
Oh, it's nothing at all.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.458
Far too unimportant

06:15.458 --> 06:17.708
for you to trifle with anyway.

06:17.708 --> 06:20.458
Well, Pooh Bear, it was
so nice to see to again,

06:20.458 --> 06:22.291
but I really must run.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.625
I'm afraid I'm much too
busy to even say good--

06:27.291 --> 06:30.625
If this thing's that
unimportant to Rabbit,

06:30.625 --> 06:33.000
I bet he'd really be pleased

06:33.000 --> 06:35.583
if I found an important
use for it.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.500
My tail.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.833
My best friend.

06:44.833 --> 06:46.250
It's gone.

06:46.250 --> 06:49.458
Hmm. Tails are just tails,
not legs.

06:49.458 --> 06:52.000
Someone
had to help it run.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.875
You mean it's been stolen?

06:54.875 --> 06:57.583
Exactically.
I'll start my search

06:57.583 --> 07:00.875
by interrogating
the nearest
suspicious rabbit.

07:00.875 --> 07:04.875
Old long ears has always
got a tale to tell.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.000
- Who can that be?

07:11.083 --> 07:12.250
Yes?

07:12.250 --> 07:13.333
Gotcha!

07:15.208 --> 07:17.000
Where were you
at 13:00 today?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.208
13:00? Why, I was--

07:19.208 --> 07:21.000
Where were you on the
night of the 43rd?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.083
I was--

07:22.083 --> 07:23.708
When was the next
to the last time

07:23.708 --> 07:25.083
you saw Eeyore's tail?

07:25.083 --> 07:27.291
Eeyore's tail? I don't know.

07:27.291 --> 07:30.000
And where does your lap go
when you stand up?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.875
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Impressive, aren't I?

07:32.875 --> 07:36.958
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?

07:36.958 --> 07:38.208
I'm on a case.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.416
I didn't think
it was that exciting.

07:42.416 --> 07:43.875
My worm wrangler.

07:43.875 --> 07:47.083
Someone took
my worm wrangler!

07:47.083 --> 07:49.208
Oh, boy! Another case!

07:49.208 --> 07:51.708
But what about my tail?

07:51.708 --> 07:52.875
Both: Not now, Eeyore.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.875
If my superstitions
are correct,

07:56.875 --> 07:58.875
these two crimes is related.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.291
But you don't have
any clues.

08:01.291 --> 08:04.458
Oh, no. The thief
took them, too!

08:04.458 --> 08:06.708
Who was the last
nogoodnik you saw

08:06.708 --> 08:08.458
nastying it up
around here?

08:08.458 --> 08:11.000
No one except Pooh Bear,
but he's--

08:11.000 --> 08:13.708
The criminimal mastermind
of the century.

08:13.708 --> 08:17.708
It's a case of very little
brain going bad.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.375
I have a sad feeling

08:19.375 --> 08:22.833
my tail's gonna come out
on the bottom of this.

08:26.833 --> 08:28.416
My tummy's telling me

08:28.416 --> 08:31.250
this whatchamacallit's
really a--

08:31.250 --> 08:32.625
a bee tickler.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.000
I was right.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.166
This certainly is
something to smile about.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.125
Uh-oh.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.708
Tickle. Tickle.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.166
Oh, bother.

08:58.166 --> 09:02.583
Is it time for a midnight
smackerel already?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.000
Whoops!

09:05.458 --> 09:06.583
Hark!

09:06.583 --> 09:08.375
My private ears tell me

09:08.375 --> 09:10.291
that's the sound
of the getaway car.

09:10.291 --> 09:14.458
Yep. And it sounds like
it's getting this way.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.166
Aha! Trying to disguise
yourself, eh, buddy bear?

09:22.166 --> 09:24.708
Well, it won't fool
this super sloth.

09:24.708 --> 09:27.000
Yes, sir, buddy,
we're on to you

09:27.000 --> 09:28.458
for committing two--

09:28.458 --> 09:29.875
count them, two--

09:29.875 --> 09:31.500
crimes of the century.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.166
Who would have thought it

09:33.166 --> 09:35.708
of such a nice, gentle friend?

09:35.708 --> 09:37.375
Confess, you two-bit hood.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.458
Where's my worm wrangler?

09:38.458 --> 09:40.083
Yeah. Where is it?

09:40.083 --> 09:42.166
But what about
my tail?

09:42.166 --> 09:45.208
I don't have a tail
or a worm wrangler,

09:45.208 --> 09:48.416
but I'm sure Mr. Private Ear
can find them both.

09:48.416 --> 09:52.375
And perhaps he can find
my missing bee tickler, too.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.625
I love this job.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.875
Tigger: When the going
gets tough

10:12.875 --> 10:15.000
and the tough
start a-groaning

10:15.000 --> 10:17.833
because things get lost
or bent or stolen,

10:17.833 --> 10:21.250
never fear. Tigger
the Private Ear is here.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.875
When you can't see the woods
'cause there's too many trees

10:32.875 --> 10:34.708
and you can't find a needle

10:34.708 --> 10:37.000
'cause the hay
makes you sneeze,

10:37.000 --> 10:41.083
never fear. Tigger
the Private Ear is here.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.166
When feetprints
need following

10:57.166 --> 10:59.000
and clues can be found,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.416
when gumshoes
are pussyfooting
all over town...

11:04.375 --> 11:08.250
never fear. Tigger
the Private Ear is here.

11:10.416 --> 11:12.166
Handcuffing and snooping

11:12.166 --> 11:14.000
and chasing down pests.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.125
Whatever the case,
it's what tiggers do best.

11:22.291 --> 11:23.583
Never fear.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.583
Tigger the
Private Ear is here.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.750
Oh, dear.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.750
Forward, men. The chase is on,

11:33.750 --> 11:37.250
and I'm leaving no stone
underdone.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.875
this worm-wrangling,
bee-tickling,

11:38.875 --> 11:41.000
tail-nabbing rogue
is mighty slick,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.875
but Private Ear Tigger
is hot on this trail,

11:43.875 --> 11:45.750
and I haven't
missed a clue yet.

11:45.750 --> 11:49.083
Sure do miss my tail.

11:49.083 --> 11:53.416
Oh, my. I wonder
where they're going
in such a hurry.

11:53.416 --> 11:56.000
Oh, dear.
That certainly looks

11:56.000 --> 11:59.625
like a very small part
of a very large animal.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.750
Well, I really
must be going, too.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.166
Heh heh heh.

12:03.166 --> 12:06.291
But don't bother getting
up to say goodbye.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.000
- Yipes.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.125
Please. I'd rather be your
friend than your dinner.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.000
Oh, my. That certainly
is a relief.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.375
You might
come in very handy

12:18.375 --> 12:20.500
for protecting me
from spookables.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.458
When you're
a very small animal,

12:22.458 --> 12:24.875
the list of spookables
is pretty big.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.708
But you
won't mind, will you?

12:29.291 --> 12:31.958
We've been marching
around for hours.

12:31.958 --> 12:34.375
Haven't you found
any clues yet, Tigger?

12:34.375 --> 12:36.000
Nope. I'm so clever,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
the thief ran out
of clues to give me.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I got to help him out
by making up some of my own.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.166
What I can't figure is why
anyone would want Eeyore's
less-than-splendiferous tail.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.833
It has to be one pitiful
little termite.

12:49.833 --> 12:52.583
Piglet's
little and pitiful,

12:52.583 --> 12:55.166
and he doesn't
have a tail.

12:55.166 --> 12:58.458
Probably just couldn't
stand it anymore.

12:58.458 --> 13:01.375
Gasp! Piglet! That's it.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.583
I'm gonna make
private ear history

13:03.583 --> 13:06.166
by sending Piglet
to the big house.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.875
Oh, but, Tigger,
he's much too little

13:08.875 --> 13:11.458
to live in a big house.

13:11.458 --> 13:15.625
Uh, come along, Pooh.
I'll explain it to you later.

13:15.625 --> 13:19.208
Tigger: Aha. There's
the little shifty shiftaroo

13:19.208 --> 13:21.583
shuffling around his hideout.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.750
The little guy sure fooled me.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.708
He must be an incredible
master of disguises.

13:26.708 --> 13:29.583
Shucks, he's so good,
I wouldn't be surprised

13:29.583 --> 13:32.208
if even he really
didn't know who he was,

13:32.208 --> 13:34.708
which means he'll
probably want to hire me

13:34.708 --> 13:36.875
to find his missing person.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.958
That's why I made
this Wanted poster.

13:38.958 --> 13:43.375
Now there's no way he can get
away from old yours truly.

13:43.375 --> 13:46.958
There. My bully
bamboozler's
all finished.

13:46.958 --> 13:49.000
Don't move, false face!

13:49.000 --> 13:50.708
We caught you pink-handed.

13:50.708 --> 13:53.583
Caught me?
Caught me doing what?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.125
Caught you looking like
this poster, of course.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.833
You know, Tigger,

13:57.833 --> 13:59.333
your poster really looks

13:59.333 --> 14:01.958
more like that gentleman
over there.

14:01.958 --> 14:04.291
Mm. You're right, Pooh.

14:04.291 --> 14:05.625
Grab him!

14:06.875 --> 14:08.958
Hoo, my word.

14:08.958 --> 14:11.083
This reminds me
of the bell rope

14:11.083 --> 14:14.125
Uncle Torbert brought back
from the Dark Continent.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.333
Nuts. He got away.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.125
And he took my bully
bamboozler with him.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.250
Tigger, you're
the great private ear.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.625
Do something.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.250
That thief has got
to be stopped.

14:25.250 --> 14:28.375
And that's just what I'm
going to do, bunny boy.

14:28.375 --> 14:30.458
I'm about to shed some light

14:30.458 --> 14:34.708
on the culprit's
dark and damp identity.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.125
It's time to get
to the top of this mess

14:40.125 --> 14:42.000
and clear it up
once and for all.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.458
Hmm. They don't make
them like they used to.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.833
I hope we're not
disturbing you, Owl.

14:51.833 --> 14:55.208
We just want to expose you
for the jailbird you are.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.958
It's my hypotenuse

14:56.958 --> 14:59.000
that Owl turned
to a life of crime

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
because he grew up
misunderstood.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.458
I? Misunderstood?

15:03.458 --> 15:05.125
Inconceivable.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.875
Don't fight it, feathers.
You haven't got a chance.

15:07.875 --> 15:11.083
I got a whole brain load
of circumserial evidence

15:11.083 --> 15:12.416
proving my point.

15:13.708 --> 15:16.333
Owl stole Piglet's
bully bamboozler

15:16.333 --> 15:18.833
to guard
his ill-gotten grains,

15:18.833 --> 15:20.708
and he took
Pooh's bee tickler

15:20.708 --> 15:23.833
to keep his pointy-tailed
minions in line.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.875
What about my worm wrangler?

15:25.875 --> 15:27.375
Who else would need it

15:27.375 --> 15:29.625
to catch those
early morning wrigglies

15:29.625 --> 15:32.500
but an early birdbrain
like Owl?

15:32.500 --> 15:35.458
Well, I-- Really, I-- Hmm?

15:35.458 --> 15:38.833
Yes, siree,
I can only conclude--

15:38.833 --> 15:40.083
Hawmp!

15:41.083 --> 15:43.083
My worm wrangler!

15:43.083 --> 15:45.458
My bee tickler.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.583
My bully bamboozler.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.875
Uncle Torbert's bell rope.

15:49.875 --> 15:54.000
Hmm. You know, I have
seen this thing before.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.416
Of course you have, Tigger.

15:56.416 --> 15:58.583
It's always the last
thing you see

15:58.583 --> 16:01.333
after Eeyore says goodbye.

16:01.333 --> 16:05.500
I know no one cares except me,

16:05.500 --> 16:08.583
but that's my tail.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.500
Wait, Eeyore! That's it!

16:10.500 --> 16:13.375
Your tail's the real
guilty party.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.458
It plotted
its own disappearance

16:15.458 --> 16:17.458
till you learned
to appreciate it.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.250
I knew it all along.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.125
Well, from now on,

16:21.125 --> 16:23.708
me and him are going
to stick together,

16:23.708 --> 16:25.708
no matter what.

16:25.708 --> 16:30.291
I'm even going to let it
walk in front for a change.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.583
Yaah!

16:32.583 --> 16:34.250
- Hawmp!

16:35.583 --> 16:37.708
Piglet: oh, dear.

16:37.708 --> 16:41.291
I think Eeyore forgot
he was at Owl's.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.083
Too bad he didn't have
a little more hindsight.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.291
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

16:45.291 --> 16:46.625
I hereby declare

16:46.625 --> 16:48.958
the case
of Eeyore's tail tale

16:48.958 --> 16:50.583
artificially closed.

16:50.583 --> 16:52.875
Well,
it's a good thing, too.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.000
With all this private ear
foolishness,

16:55.000 --> 16:56.750
I've lost my patience.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.291
Lost your patience?

16:58.291 --> 17:00.333
Then I,
Tigger Private Ear,

17:00.333 --> 17:02.625
won't rest till I find it.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.250
How and will I ever learn?

17:14.250 --> 17:15.958
Pooh:
"Once upon a time,

17:15.958 --> 17:18.708
there were three
little," uh...

17:18.708 --> 17:19.750
Hmm.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.166
Oh, yes. Much better.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.000
"Once upon a time,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.333
there were three
little piglets..."

17:27.333 --> 17:29.333
- and a honey tree.
-

17:29.333 --> 17:31.875
In every story,
there's honey.

17:31.875 --> 17:34.375
This time, Pooh, for once,

17:34.375 --> 17:37.000
please, no honey.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Well, I'm sorry, Rabbit.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.875
For some reason, honey
seems to be on my mind.

17:42.875 --> 17:46.708
Pooh Bear, it's the only
thing on your mind.

17:46.708 --> 17:49.875
So please,
just tell the story.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.166
All right, Rabbit.

17:51.166 --> 17:53.083
Ahem.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.708
The first little piglet

17:54.708 --> 17:57.208
lived in a honey tree, and--

17:57.208 --> 17:58.291
Rabbit: No.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.833
He lived in a house
of straw, Pooh.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.250
Pooh: Yes. A house of straw,

18:07.250 --> 18:09.458
which was next
to a honey tree.

18:09.458 --> 18:10.833
Rabbit: Pooh Bear.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.416
And the little piglet--

18:12.416 --> 18:17.500
Was scared out of his wits
by the big bad bunny.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.708
It's supposed to be a wolf--
a big bad wolf.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.583
Not anymore.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

18:24.583 --> 18:26.166
Pooh, giggling: Yes.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.000
So the big bad bunny

18:28.000 --> 18:30.875
was looking for his
grandma's house, and--

18:30.875 --> 18:34.500
Oh, my, Grandma,
what big ears you have.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.708
Uh, what's in the basket?

18:39.333 --> 18:41.458
I should have known.

18:41.458 --> 18:44.125
Say,
for a big bad bunny,

18:44.125 --> 18:45.958
this bunny's
not being very bad.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.333
For once you're right, Tigger.

18:48.333 --> 18:51.708
We have lost track
of the story. Haven't we?

18:51.708 --> 18:53.291
Ahem.

18:53.291 --> 18:56.875
Let me into your house,
little Piglet.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.708
What do I do, Pooh?

18:58.708 --> 19:02.875
I believe you should
say no, Piglet.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.708
No, Piglet.

19:04.708 --> 19:08.250
Why, then I'll huff
and I'll puff,

19:08.250 --> 19:10.875
and I'll blow
your house down.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.875
Ha ha. Ahem. Not bad
if I do say so myself.

19:17.875 --> 19:22.166
Oh, dear. And then
what happened, Pooh?

19:22.166 --> 19:24.416
Then the second little piglet,

19:24.416 --> 19:26.375
who lived
in a house of sticks--

19:26.375 --> 19:30.583
Tigger:
Say, kind of resembles
the Eeyore residence.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.583
Pooh: And then
the Papa Bear said--

19:33.583 --> 19:37.958
Looks like somebody's
been sleeping in my bed.

19:39.583 --> 19:40.833
No, no, no.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.458
This is another story
entirely.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.125
The first little piglet

19:45.125 --> 19:47.000
went to the second little
piglet who lived in--

19:47.000 --> 19:49.333
Tigger: A house of cards.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

19:49.333 --> 19:51.083
Oh, why do I bother?

19:52.166 --> 19:53.583
And I suppose now

19:53.583 --> 19:55.625
I have to blow
this house down.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.416
I'll do it for you, long ears.

19:57.416 --> 19:59.458
I'll huff and I'll puff,

19:59.458 --> 20:02.416
and I'll blow the house down.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.625
Oh, bother.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.708
I seem to have lost my place.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.875
Um, I believe
this is the part--

20:11.875 --> 20:14.625
heh heh-- where
the three little piglets
are all together.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.958
How do you do?
I'm Piglet.

20:17.958 --> 20:19.208
- Me, too.
- So am I.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.375
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.458
No. The pleasure
is all mine.

20:22.458 --> 20:23.625
No. It's mine.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.208
Rabbit: Pooh Bear.

20:27.958 --> 20:32.000
You finally have them right,
but what about me?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.208
Oh, well. It's close
enough, I suppose.

20:35.208 --> 20:40.708
Ahem. You little piglets
had better let me in.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.875
Oh, who will save me--

20:44.875 --> 20:46.708
uh, us now?

20:46.708 --> 20:49.083
Never fear, citizens!

20:49.083 --> 20:51.250
It is I,
the Masked Defender,

20:51.250 --> 20:52.625
to the rescue!

20:52.625 --> 20:55.333
No, no, no!

20:55.333 --> 20:57.208
You don't belong here.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.833
Whoops.

20:58.833 --> 21:02.250
There is no Masked
Defender in this story.

21:02.250 --> 21:05.875
Pooh, uh, just why
does the big bad bunny

21:05.875 --> 21:07.208
want to get
into the house?

21:07.208 --> 21:11.000
I believe he wants
to borrow some...honey.

21:12.708 --> 21:15.375
No. Not that.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.708
Uh, he, uh, he wants, uh--

21:17.708 --> 21:19.333
Tigger: To get
out of the rain.

21:21.416 --> 21:23.625
That's it. No more.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.375
This has gone far enough.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.416
Big bad bunnies,
Papa Bears.

21:29.416 --> 21:31.083
It's too much!

21:31.083 --> 21:32.708
I'm taking over.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.875
I'm going to tell this story

21:34.875 --> 21:37.125
the way it's supposed
to be told. Ahem.

21:37.125 --> 21:41.375
- I'm going to huff and puff

21:41.375 --> 21:44.208
and blow your tree down.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.875
Oh, d-d-dear.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.250
Whoo!

21:48.250 --> 21:49.875
Pooh: And the three
little piglets,

21:49.875 --> 21:51.583
who had all the honey
they wanted,

21:51.583 --> 21:53.875
lived happily ever after.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.125
The end.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.583
Oh, I love happy--

21:57.583 --> 21:59.750
-- endings, Pooh.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.000
Uh, but what happened
to the big bad bunny?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.708
Uh, don't ask, Piglet.
Don't ask.
