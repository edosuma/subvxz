<i>that there's a younger sister,</i>
<i>Katharine.</i>

01:24.385 --> 01:27.953
<i>So basically,</i>
<i>our story begins in 1874</i>

01:27.955 --> 01:29.154
<i>in Dayton, Ohio,</i>

01:29.156 --> 01:32.124
<i>and basically she</i>
<i>and Orville and Wilbur</i>

01:32.126 --> 01:34.193
<i>were, like best friends,</i>
<i>and they'd do, like,</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:36.095
<i>all kinds of old-timey</i>
<i>activities</i>

01:36.097 --> 01:37.596
that were fun for people then.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.164
Like, they would collect bones

01:39.166 --> 01:41.700
<i>and sell them</i>
<i>to fertilizing plants.</i>

01:41.702 --> 01:42.468
- Classic thing to do.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.471
- You know, classic,
like bone collecting.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.005
And they made a pact together

01:47.007 --> 01:48.273
that they were never
gonna get married.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.542
<i>Like, the brothers were like,</i>
<i>let's not get married.</i>

01:50.544 --> 01:52.311
<i>Why don't we all just, like,</i>
<i>be together?</i>

01:52.313 --> 01:54.646
<i>We'll just be, like, a unit.</i>
<i>And Katharine's like,</i>

01:54.648 --> 01:55.981
<i>maybe I'll meet someone</i>
<i>I actually like.</i>

01:55.983 --> 01:57.549
<i>Like, you guys are my brothers,</i>
<i>and I don't really feel</i>

01:57.551 --> 01:59.017
<i>like that about you guys,</i>
<i>and I don't think I should</i>

01:59.019 --> 02:00.486
<i>feel like that about you guys.</i>
<i>And they're like,</i>

02:00.488 --> 02:03.122
<i>no, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>Let's just stick together</i>

02:03.124 --> 02:04.423
<i>and be, like, a thing.</i>

02:04.425 --> 02:07.259
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>fine, I guess.</i>

02:07.261 --> 02:08.026
<i>[laughs]</i>

02:08.028 --> 02:09.628
And then basically, like,
the brothers

02:09.630 --> 02:12.197
started getting really
into the idea of manned flight,

02:12.199 --> 02:14.433
and so they're like--
like, I don't care about school.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.801
<i>I want to work on my planes.</i>
<i>And he's like,</i>

02:15.803 --> 02:16.869
<i>I want to work</i>
<i>on my planes too.</i>

02:16.871 --> 02:18.003
<i>I want to work</i>
<i>on planes with you.</i>

02:18.005 --> 02:20.339
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>And Katharine was like,</i>

02:20.341 --> 02:21.240
<i>I believe in you.</i>

02:21.242 --> 02:22.407
<i>And they didn't graduate</i>
<i>high school.</i>

02:22.409 --> 02:25.210
<i>They were just really focused</i>
<i>on the whole plane situation,</i>

02:25.212 --> 02:27.346
<i>so meanwhile,</i>
<i>Katharine graduated</i>

02:27.348 --> 02:29.114
<i>from Oberlin College in 1898,</i>

02:29.116 --> 02:32.985
<i>so she was very, like,</i>
<i>smart and successful</i>

02:32.987 --> 02:34.653
in her own "Wright."

02:34.655 --> 02:36.555
- Oh, man.
- I didn't want to do that,

02:36.557 --> 02:37.956

- Okay.

02:37.958 --> 02:38.891
[laughing]

02:38.893 --> 02:40.993
<i>So when she graduates</i>
<i>from college,</i>

02:40.995 --> 02:44.429
<i>Orville's like,</i>
<i>I have a present for you.</i>

02:44.431 --> 02:46.298
<i>It's a diamond ring.</i>

02:46.300 --> 02:48.400

<i>He's like, no, it's like</i>
<i>a brother-sister thing.</i>

02:51.505 --> 02:53.172
<i>Like, it's just, like, a ring.</i>
<i>Like, it'll just--</i>

02:53.174 --> 02:54.573
<i>it'll just be like--</i>
<i>it's like our pact.</i>

02:54.575 --> 02:57.709
<i>And she's like, okay,</i>
<i>that's kind of weird,</i>

02:57.711 --> 02:58.744
<i>but I guess I'll wear it</i>

02:58.746 --> 02:59.711
<i>until I meet someone.</i>

02:59.713 --> 03:01.513
<i>He's like, no,</i>
<i>you'll never meet anyone.</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:04.082
<i>She's like,</i>
<i>I might meet someone.</i>

03:04.084 --> 03:05.651

03:05.653 --> 03:08.053

03:08.055 --> 03:09.488
- That's okay.
- Okay.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.290
- Moving right along.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.624
<i>So in 1901,</i>

03:12.626 --> 03:15.727
<i>Orville and Wilbur</i>
<i>build the Wright glider,</i>

03:15.729 --> 03:17.763
<i>and they go to Kitty Hawk,</i>
<i>North Carolina,</i>

03:17.765 --> 03:21.600
<i>and they're like, we're gonna</i>
<i>fly the first plane ever.</i>

03:21.602 --> 03:25.871
<i>♪ ♪</i>

03:25.873 --> 03:26.838
<i>But then it goes</i>

03:26.840 --> 03:29.775
<i>It, like, falls apart,</i>
<i>and it was a complete disaster,</i>

03:29.777 --> 03:32.678
<i>and basically</i>
<i>they had a horrible time.</i>

03:32.680 --> 03:35.814
<i>So basically they're just like,</i>
<i>forget this.</i>

03:35.816 --> 03:36.848

03:36.850 --> 03:38.951

03:45.593 --> 03:46.658
<i>No one's ever done this.</i>

03:46.660 --> 03:47.926
<i>Why would you think</i>
<i>it would work perfectly</i>

03:47.928 --> 03:50.195

<i>and also let me help you,</i>

03:51.198 --> 03:53.398
<i>because I'm smarter</i>
<i>than both of you.</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:55.367
<i>And so they got reinvigorated,</i>

03:55.369 --> 03:57.269
and basically they decided

03:57.271 --> 03:58.971
they were gonna
fly planes again, because--

03:58.973 --> 04:01.840
- You have to drink every time
you say "basically."

04:01.842 --> 04:04.176
New rule.

04:04.178 --> 04:04.743
- Okay.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.912
<i>So their family had, like,</i>
<i>a bicycle shop,</i>

04:06.914 --> 04:09.681
<i>and so, like, they were working</i>
<i>in this shop,</i>

04:09.683 --> 04:11.883
<i>trying out</i>
<i>all these different ways</i>

04:11.885 --> 04:12.751
<i>to make planes.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:14.786
<i>And Katharine's like,</i>
<i>let's look at research</i>

04:14.788 --> 04:16.221
<i>from other people</i>
<i>who've done this before.</i>

04:16.223 --> 04:19.024
<i>You guys aren't--you're just</i>
<i>making it up at this point.</i>

04:19.026 --> 04:21.159
And so she's, like,
translating from German

04:21.161 --> 04:22.761
<i>and all these languages,</i>
<i>and she's like,</i>

04:22.763 --> 04:24.830
<i>this says you need to fly</i>
<i>like this.</i>

04:24.832 --> 04:26.965
<i>You have to go and make</i>
<i>the wings, like, bigger.</i>

04:26.967 --> 04:28.400
<i>Make the wings, like,</i>
<i>taller, and--</i>

04:28.402 --> 04:31.303
<i>and go and believe in it more</i>
<i>and all this stuff.</i>

04:31.305 --> 04:37.009
<i>And they created</i>
<i>a whole new plane together.</i>

04:37.011 --> 04:39.311
And so basically--

04:39.313 --> 04:40.345
- Uh, you got to drink.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.347
Basically.
- Oh, shit.

04:44.584 --> 04:47.919
Okay, so December 17, 1903,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.554
<i>they try it again</i>
<i>at Kitty Hawk,</i>

04:49.556 --> 04:52.057
and Orville Wright fow--
fowered--

04:52.059 --> 04:54.793
[laughing]
Powered the first flight.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.329
<i>20 feet above the ground,</i>

04:57.331 --> 04:58.997
<i>and it's epic,</i>

04:58.999 --> 05:00.766
<i>and I don't like</i>
<i>the word "epic,"</i>

05:00.768 --> 05:03.502
<i>but I have said it here</i>
<i>because it's accurate.</i>

05:03.504 --> 05:04.336
<i>It's a really big deal,</i>

05:04.338 --> 05:06.338
<i>and they have, like,</i>
<i>700 successful flights.</i>

05:06.340 --> 05:07.539
<i>They're up,</i>
<i>and the they're down.</i>

05:07.541 --> 05:09.007
<i>They're all over the place.</i>

05:09.009 --> 05:10.742
[clears throat]

05:11.611 --> 05:14.913
So, like, Katharine flies
in the plane

05:14.915 --> 05:16.581
<i>for the first time ever,</i>

05:16.583 --> 05:18.183
<i>and she was like,</i>

05:18.185 --> 05:19.418
<i>I feel like a bird,</i>

05:19.420 --> 05:20.652
<i>and birds are so happy,</i>

05:20.654 --> 05:22.454
<i>and birds sing</i>
<i>because they're happy.</i>

05:22.456 --> 05:26.358
<i>So Wilbur's like, we couldn't</i>
<i>have done it without you.</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:28.427
<i>I love you.</i>

05:28.429 --> 05:30.662
<i>So then, years later,</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:33.365
<i>Katharine is like,</i>
<i>all right, [bleep] this.</i>

05:33.367 --> 05:34.399
<i>I'm getting married.</i>
<i>I'm 52.</i>

05:34.401 --> 05:36.301
<i>I might as well get married</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

05:36.303 --> 05:38.470
<i>I feel like the pact is over.</i>

05:38.472 --> 05:39.538
<i>Meanwhile, Orville's like,</i>

05:39.540 --> 05:41.907
<i>no, the pact's not done.</i>
<i>I hate you.</i>

05:41.909 --> 05:44.076
<i>I'm not gonna speak to you</i>

05:44.078 --> 05:46.011

<i>I have this dude now,</i>

<i>and I don't really care if you</i>
<i>don't talk to me anymore.</i>

05:48.382 --> 05:50.382
<i>And they, like, make out</i>
<i>in front of Orville.</i>

05:50.384 --> 05:51.950
<i>It's really rude.</i>

05:51.952 --> 05:55.287
<i>[both laughing]</i>

05:58.958 --> 06:00.225

<i>- It's so rude.</i>

06:02.262 --> 06:05.564
<i>Orville's like,</i>
<i>damn, this blows.</i>

06:05.566 --> 06:08.333
We all have known

06:08.335 --> 06:10.869
for as long as
we all have lived,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.170

have Katharine,

they wouldn't have had

<i>cart was smashed</i>

07:32.319 --> 07:34.352
<i>by an automobile.</i>

07:34.354 --> 07:37.355
Who was driving
this automobile?

07:37.357 --> 07:40.392
It was Henry Kaufman.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.827
<i>He was a mean little guy</i>

07:41.829 --> 07:45.897
<i>who owned the Paterson</i>
<i>silk-dyeing corporation.</i>

07:45.899 --> 07:47.799
<i>Constance comes out</i>
<i>and she's like, yo!</i>

07:47.801 --> 07:50.202
<i>What the [bleep] happened</i>
<i>to my buggy?</i>

07:50.204 --> 07:52.537
<i>Ah, I don't know.</i>

07:52.539 --> 07:53.505
<i>Who cares?</i>

07:53.507 --> 07:54.372
<i>You're a woman.</i>

07:54.374 --> 07:56.741
<i>I'm Henry Kaufman.</i>
<i>I'm the king of silk.</i>

07:56.743 --> 08:01.746
<i>I'm not gonna worry about some</i>
<i>horse and buggy bullshit.</i>

08:01.748 --> 08:03.448
<i>[bleep] you.</i>

08:03.450 --> 08:04.082
<i>[laughs]</i>

08:04.084 --> 08:06.184
<i>So he drives off in his car,</i>

08:06.186 --> 08:07.686
<i>but Constance</i>
<i>was just like, no.</i>

08:07.688 --> 08:09.988
<i>We're not gonna let this guy</i>
<i>walk over us.</i>

08:09.990 --> 08:11.923
<i>We're going to e-mail--</i>

08:11.925 --> 08:12.591
[laughing]

08:12.593 --> 08:15.427
We're gonna write him a letter
and say, "Give me 50 bucks.

08:15.429 --> 08:19.264
<i>Give us 50 bucks,"</i>
<i>so they go home to their farm</i>

08:19.266 --> 08:23.034
<i>and she sends a letter</i>
<i>to Henry Kaufman.</i>

08:23.036 --> 08:24.169
Doesn't hear a response.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.806
<i>So a few weeks go by,</i>
<i>and a brick goes through</i>

08:27.808 --> 08:29.608
<i>their farmhouse window.</i>

08:29.610 --> 08:30.742
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

08:30.744 --> 08:31.710
<i>I don't know, a brick.</i>

08:31.712 --> 08:33.712
<i>Who would do it?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

08:33.714 --> 08:37.482
<i>A week later, Norma went out</i>
<i>to the outhouse</i>

08:37.484 --> 08:38.617
<i>behind the farmhouse</i>

08:38.619 --> 08:39.985
<i>and boom!</i>
<i>Boom!</i>

08:39.987 --> 08:41.786
She was getting shot at!

08:41.788 --> 08:43.488
She runs back inside.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.122
<i>Guys!</i>

08:44.124 --> 08:45.390
<i>I was trying to take a dump</i>

08:45.392 --> 08:47.259
<i>and I was getting shot at!</i>

08:47.261 --> 08:50.095
<i>So the Kopp sisters are</i>
<i>starting to get so pissed off</i>

08:50.097 --> 08:54.933
<i>about this, so they go</i>
<i>to the county prosecutor,</i>

08:54.935 --> 08:57.636
<i>and they say,</i>
<i>"Look, we're getting harassed,</i>

08:57.638 --> 08:58.670
<i>"we're getting threatened.</i>

08:58.672 --> 08:59.638
<i>"You need to help us out here.</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:02.440
<i>You need to send</i>
<i>some people over to our farm."</i>

09:02.442 --> 09:03.642
<i>And he's like, I don't know.</i>

09:03.644 --> 09:04.609
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

09:04.611 --> 09:07.312
<i>There's no proof.</i>
<i>There's no proof.</i>

09:07.314 --> 09:12.017
<i>But the sheriff</i>
<i>of Bergen County, Robert Heath,</i>

09:12.019 --> 09:13.952
<i>overheard what</i>
<i>they were talking about,</i>

09:13.954 --> 09:18.523
<i>and Sheriff Heath was like,</i>
<i>I'll help you, little ladies.</i>

09:18.525 --> 09:20.025
<i>I'll teach you</i>
<i>how to help yourself.</i>

09:20.027 --> 09:25.230
<i>So Sheriff Heath gives</i>
<i>all three of the Kopp sisters</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:25.997
<i>a gun.</i>

09:25.999 --> 09:29.134
So he taught them
how to use the guns.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.135
<i>Aim up.</i>

09:30.137 --> 09:31.937
<i>Aim at your target.</i>

09:31.939 --> 09:34.105
<i>[imitating gunfire]</i>

09:34.107 --> 09:35.907
<i>He let them hold the guns</i>

09:35.909 --> 09:36.908
<i>and kiss guns.</i>

09:36.910 --> 09:38.143
<i>Whatever you do to guns.</i>

09:38.145 --> 09:39.544
[both chuckle]

09:39.546 --> 09:41.246
And that's a fact.

09:41.248 --> 09:41.846
[both laugh]

09:41.848 --> 09:46.117
So the media heard about
the Kopp sisters,

09:46.119 --> 09:48.253
<i>and they became a sensation.</i>

09:48.255 --> 09:51.556
<i>So you'd think that</i>
<i>these people would give up.</i>

09:51.558 --> 09:52.791
Like, these ladies are armed.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.192
They're dangerous.
No.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.796
<i>The Kopp sisters got</i>
<i>an extortion letter,</i>

09:57.798 --> 10:00.131
<i>and it said,</i>
<i>"Bring $1,000</i>

10:00.133 --> 10:06.471
<i>"to the corner of Broadway and</i>

10:06.473 --> 10:08.139
<i>"We know where you live.</i>

<i>"We're gonna kill your farm</i>

10:23.624 --> 10:25.757
Which that--I mean,
that's Henry Kaufman.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.524
That's his initials.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.060
Like, it's clearly Mr. Silk
himself.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.230
<i>So Constance wasn't gonna</i>
<i>have this.</i>

10:32.232 --> 10:35.467
<i>She's like, I'm taking this</i>
<i>into my own hands.</i>

10:35.469 --> 10:40.138
<i>So she goes to the corner</i>
<i>of Broadway and Carol</i>

10:40.140 --> 10:45.076
and a man in black shows up,
but she's not alone.

10:45.078 --> 10:48.446
<i>She has backup</i>

<i>[stammering]</i>

10:51.318 --> 10:53.685
<i>And then he realizes</i>
<i>the jig is up</i>

10:53.687 --> 10:54.586
and he runs!

10:54.588 --> 10:56.521
<i>And Sheriff Heath's like, go!</i>

10:56.523 --> 10:57.689
<i>Go!</i>
<i>Go!</i>

10:57.691 --> 11:00.625
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>well, how do we prove</i>
<i>it was Henry Kaufman?</i>

11:04.898 --> 11:06.698
<i>New science:</i>

11:06.700 --> 11:08.533
<i>handwriting analysis.</i>

11:08.535 --> 11:13.705
<i>They hired William J. Kingsley</i>
<i>to examine the handwriting,</i>

11:13.707 --> 11:16.908
<i>and William J. Kingsley said,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God.</i>

11:16.910 --> 11:20.545
<i>This is the same</i>
<i>as Henry Kaufman."</i>

11:20.547 --> 11:21.880
<i>♪ ♪</i>

11:21.882 --> 11:26.217
<i>"We know that</i>
<i>he is the criminal</i>

11:26.219 --> 11:29.320
<i>that went after</i>
<i>the Kopp sisters."</i>

11:29.322 --> 11:30.755
<i>And because it was</i>
<i>his handwriting</i>

11:30.757 --> 11:33.792
<i>and he used the Post Office,</i>
<i>it became a federal crime,</i>

11:33.794 --> 11:37.962
and we went to jail
for abusing the mail.

11:37.964 --> 11:42.100
<i>So Constance Kopp brought down</i>
<i>this kingpin</i>

11:42.102 --> 11:43.868
<i>everyone was scared of</i>

11:43.870 --> 11:46.738

11:58.518 --> 11:59.384
<i>[triumphant music]</i>

11:59.386 --> 12:00.952
<i>And then the Kopp sisters</i>

<i>started their own</i>
<i>detective agency,</i>

12:03.090 --> 12:05.757
<i>and they solved cases</i>
<i>and they found out--</i>

12:05.759 --> 12:09.094
there were crimes
and everything.

12:09.096 --> 12:14.332
So Constance's achievements--

[speaking indistinctly]

12:16.369 --> 12:17.402

Sorry.

12:18.705 --> 12:19.270
[laughs]

12:19.272 --> 12:23.108
So Constance's achievements
became world-renowned,

12:23.110 --> 12:26.611
<i>so when Constance passed away,</i>
<i>everyone was very sad.</i>

12:26.613 --> 12:29.814
- The others,
did they continue as detectives?

12:29.816 --> 12:30.815
- They didn't continue
as detectives.

12:30.817 --> 12:34.686
Fleurette was really into,
like, fashion and music

12:34.688 --> 12:35.587
and singing and stuff,

12:35.589 --> 12:38.223
and you know her as Madonna.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.424
No, that's not true.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.291
[laughs]

12:40.293 --> 12:43.495
That's not true.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.763
- Have you ever seen a ghost?

12:44.765 --> 12:45.797
- Of course not.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.865
- Why you say, "Of course not"?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.133
- I enjoy hearing
ghost stories--

12:48.135 --> 12:50.435
- You do like ghost stories.
- Yeah, and I enjoy hearing

12:50.437 --> 12:55.240
other people's accounts,
but that's all garbage.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.141
- Okay.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.376
- How's it going?
I'm Hollywood's JD Ryznar,

12:58.378 --> 13:01.446
and today we're gonna talk about
the Fox sisters

13:01.448 --> 13:04.516
and all the ghosts
they talked to.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.819
- I'm gonna prove you wrong
tonight.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.920
- So...

13:08.922 --> 13:13.925
our story begins in the 1840s
in a small farmhouse

13:13.927 --> 13:16.027
<i>of the Fox family.</i>

13:16.029 --> 13:17.529
<i>And it's a spooky house.</i>

13:17.531 --> 13:21.232
<i>They hear sounds at night:</i>
<i>knocks on the door,</i>

13:21.234 --> 13:23.668
<i>phantom steps on the stairs.</i>

13:23.670 --> 13:24.569
[knocking]

13:24.571 --> 13:30.375
<i>And young Maggie and Katie Fox</i>
<i>run into their parents' room</i>

13:30.377 --> 13:35.346
<i>and say, "Mom, Dad, there's</i>
<i>a fricking ghost in our room.</i>

13:35.348 --> 13:37.515
<i>You got to come check it out."</i>

13:37.517 --> 13:39.284
<i>And the mom runs into the room,</i>

13:39.286 --> 13:44.255
<i>and the girls are like,</i>
<i>ghost, are you there?</i>

13:44.257 --> 13:47.258
Tap, rap, ghost.
Are you there?

13:47.260 --> 13:50.295
Rap two times for yes,
three times for no.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.397
<i>And the ghost goes...</i>
<i>[taps twice]</i>

13:52.399 --> 13:57.101
<i>And the mom's like, oh my--</i>
<i>holy smokes!</i>

13:57.103 --> 13:59.370
<i>It's a ghost in our house!</i>

13:59.372 --> 14:01.773
What they learned
from the rapper once they--

14:01.775 --> 14:03.842
once they figured out
a special code

14:03.844 --> 14:10.048
<i>was that this ghost</i>
<i>was a peddler who was murdered</i>

14:10.050 --> 14:12.317
<i>and buried in their cellar.</i>

14:12.319 --> 14:14.786
<i>And the mom, she starts</i>
<i>bringing neighbors over,</i>

14:14.788 --> 14:18.156
<i>and everybody was like,</i>
<i>oh my--these girls can talk</i>

14:18.158 --> 14:21.726
<i>to ghosts,</i>
<i>to the spirits of the dead.</i>

14:21.728 --> 14:23.194
<i>This is the real deal.</i>

14:23.196 --> 14:26.364
So fearing for
their daughters' souls,

14:26.366 --> 14:29.901
<i>Ma and Pop Fox sent Maggie</i>
<i>and Katie off to live</i>

14:29.903 --> 14:33.238
<i>with their sister Leah</i>
<i>in Rochester, New York,</i>

14:33.240 --> 14:37.141
<i>and when Leah saw their skills</i>
<i>with communicating to ghosts,</i>

14:37.143 --> 14:41.279
<i>she was like, I want--</i>
<i>I want to be your manager,</i>

14:41.281 --> 14:44.148
<i>and we're gonna make</i>
<i>a lot of money.</i>

14:44.150 --> 14:46.851
<i>So she invites the press,</i>
<i>and the press comes,</i>

14:46.853 --> 14:48.086
<i>and they are--</i>
<i>they're skeptical.</i>

14:48.088 --> 14:51.322
<i>They're like, these ghost girls</i>
<i>can't talk to ghosts.</i>

14:51.324 --> 14:55.627
This is garbage, but Maggie
and Katie are so good,

14:55.629 --> 14:57.729
they convince the press, like...
[taps twice]

14:57.731 --> 15:02.100
<i>Your sister</i>
<i>has three dead babies.</i>

15:02.102 --> 15:05.737
<i>And he's like, my sister</i>
<i>has three dead babies!</i>

15:05.739 --> 15:07.071
<i>I believe you.</i>

15:07.073 --> 15:10.041
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>
<i>everybody believes it.</i>

15:10.043 --> 15:13.711
And the Fox sisters
were the first people

15:13.713 --> 15:15.246
ever to be called mediums.

15:15.248 --> 15:19.183
<i>And so this new thing thing</i>
<i>called spiritualism</i>

15:19.185 --> 15:23.321
<i>lights a blaze across</i>
<i>the United States of America.</i>

15:23.323 --> 15:25.356
<i>But wait!</i>
<i>Stop the reenactment</i>

15:25.358 --> 15:26.758
<i>because guess what.</i>

15:26.760 --> 15:29.127
There was--
- Mm-hmm.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.229
- It's all bullshit.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.797
[exclaiming]

15:32.799 --> 15:34.198
You ever see "Wayne's World"?
[exclaiming]

15:34.200 --> 15:35.366
- Of course I've seen
"Wayne's World."

15:35.368 --> 15:37.101
- That's what they do when
they do a flashback.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.002
We're gonna do one now.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.570
This is gonna be good.
- [laughs]

15:39.572 --> 15:41.973
<i>- Make the picture look wavy.</i>

15:41.975 --> 15:44.742
<i>[both exclaiming]</i>

15:44.744 --> 15:47.211
<i>So here's what really happened:</i>

15:47.213 --> 15:51.516
<i>Maggie and Katie are pulling</i>
<i>pranks on their parents</i>

15:51.518 --> 15:52.784
<i>on April Fool's Eve.</i>

15:52.786 --> 15:57.588
<i>The girls are tying apples</i>
<i>to strings and making sounds</i>

15:57.590 --> 15:59.057
<i>up the stairs.</i>

15:59.059 --> 16:01.559
<i>Woop, boop, boop, boop, boop.</i>

16:01.561 --> 16:03.027
<i>Katie says to Maggie,</i>

16:03.029 --> 16:06.197
<i>You know how you can</i>
<i>snap your toes</i>

16:06.199 --> 16:07.598
<i>like you snap your fingers?</i>

16:07.600 --> 16:08.533
<i>You should do that,</i>

16:08.535 --> 16:10.702
<i>and they'll think</i>
<i>it's the ghost</i>

16:10.704 --> 16:12.103
<i>because they're dumb.</i>

16:12.105 --> 16:14.272
<i>So they were cracking</i>
<i>their toe knuckles,</i>

16:14.274 --> 16:16.140
and snapping their toes
like this,

16:16.142 --> 16:19.277
and that was the raps
that the ghosts made.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.313
<i>These little kids were [bleep]</i>
<i>with their mom.</i>

16:22.315 --> 16:24.615
<i>Next they knew,</i>
<i>they were making money.</i>

16:24.617 --> 16:26.384
<i>But Maggie says to Katie, like,</i>

16:26.386 --> 16:28.853
<i>hey, this is not quite</i>
<i>a good idea,</i>

16:28.855 --> 16:31.622
<i>'cause we're kind of fooling</i>
<i>people into this.</i>

16:31.624 --> 16:34.225
<i>And Katie's like,</i>
<i>we should keep doing this,</i>

16:34.227 --> 16:35.126
<i>'cause this is fun.</i>

16:35.128 --> 16:37.528
