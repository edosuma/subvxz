00:02.167 --> 00:04.234
There's always been some thing,

00:04.236 --> 00:06.202
like a dark cloud hanging over me.

00:06.204 --> 00:07.837
When that old woman grabbed me,

00:07.839 --> 00:09.872
it was like it was
inside me now, growing.

00:09.874 --> 00:11.307
What brings you to the V.A.?

00:11.309 --> 00:13.975
There's a doc downstairs
who deals with PTSD.

00:13.976 --> 00:15.303
I was in the field a long time.

00:15.305 --> 00:17.244
Minute I got back to New York,
all went south from there.

00:17.246 --> 00:19.880
Your name is Death.

00:19.882 --> 00:22.015
Hell follows behind you.

00:22.017 --> 00:24.686
I've seen too much death.
I've had it all around me.

00:24.688 --> 00:26.286
I can't handle it anymore.

00:47.462 --> 00:49.429
Damien.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.322
How long have I been here?

00:57.324 --> 00:59.256
Since yesterday.

00:59.258 --> 01:01.524
How are you feeling?

01:01.526 --> 01:03.793
The worst that's happened is

01:03.795 --> 01:06.063
he knows what's been going on.

01:10.635 --> 01:14.271
You know, it's a good thing
they found you when they did.

01:14.273 --> 01:16.205
I know you've had a hard time lately,

01:16.207 --> 01:18.540
but I just want you to know
that we're gonna help.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.210
Okay? You're safe.

01:21.212 --> 01:22.511
Am I?

01:22.513 --> 01:24.113
Are you family?

01:24.115 --> 01:26.515
- No.
- Then I need to ask you to step out

01:26.517 --> 01:28.817
so we can speak privately.

01:28.819 --> 01:29.852
Of course.

01:29.854 --> 01:32.321
I'll talk to you later.

01:37.194 --> 01:38.760
Look, I don't know what
that lady told you,

01:38.762 --> 01:40.561
but I... I wasn't doing
anything that was...

01:40.563 --> 01:41.829
You weren't trying to commit suicide?

01:45.402 --> 01:47.668
Ms. Rutledge just explained to me

01:47.670 --> 01:50.704
that you've been treated
for substance abuse.

01:50.706 --> 01:53.240
She said this whole thing
was probably an accident.

01:56.312 --> 01:57.511
That's true.

02:00.616 --> 02:03.184
I know a suicide when
I see one, Mr. Thorn.

02:03.186 --> 02:05.986
We're keeping you for
72-hour observation.

02:05.988 --> 02:07.987
And I believe the police
want to speak to you.

02:07.989 --> 02:09.589
There's a Detective Shay on his way.

03:13.498 --> 03:15.798
Yo! Where you been?

03:15.800 --> 03:17.366
Been trying to reach you all night.

03:17.368 --> 03:20.369
I've been busy. What are we doing here?

03:20.371 --> 03:21.770
Come inside.

03:21.772 --> 03:23.705
There's this guy, he keeps
asking to talk to you.

03:23.707 --> 03:25.308
He won't tell me what it's about,

03:25.310 --> 03:27.176
but he says you're gonna
want to hear this.

03:27.178 --> 03:28.811
Come on. It's right here.

04:13.355 --> 04:14.687
I brought my friend.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.589
What'd you want to tell him?

04:16.591 --> 04:18.190
I don't want trouble, okay?

04:18.192 --> 04:19.757
He's not a cop, all right?
You can talk to him.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.897
I don't know. About six months ago,

04:25.899 --> 04:28.467
I'm here all alone, closing up shop.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.934
Two guys walk in.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.438
They ask if I could drop ink
on somebody who's passed out.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.839
You know, like a gag.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.408
Only these two guys don't
look like they're joking.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.809
What'd you tell them?

04:37.811 --> 04:41.645
That, uh, you know, I got
professional standards.

04:41.647 --> 04:43.814
That's frat-house bullshit.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.217
It's not how I do business.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.585
They said, uh...

04:48.587 --> 04:51.322
They said that they would break my arms

04:51.324 --> 04:52.990
if I didn't do it.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.959
Wouldn't be able to wipe
my own ass for months.

04:55.961 --> 04:57.460
So much for professional standards.

04:57.462 --> 05:00.663
Well, they popped the trunk.

05:00.665 --> 05:02.232
There was this guy inside.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.969
It was you.

05:09.374 --> 05:10.673
What?

05:10.675 --> 05:12.308
- They told me to do it.
- To do what?

05:12.310 --> 05:13.976
That thing on your head,
under your hairline.

05:13.978 --> 05:15.244
What thing?

05:17.948 --> 05:19.515
The tattoo.

05:23.054 --> 05:26.355
The number 666.

05:56.511 --> 06:01.717
<font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix

06:06.994 --> 06:08.991
Damien!

06:10.698 --> 06:12.931
Hey, Damien!

06:12.933 --> 06:15.000
Is it true?

06:21.775 --> 06:23.082
Geez! What the...

06:24.111 --> 06:25.577
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Where did find this guy?

06:25.579 --> 06:26.418
- Hey, what...
- Where'd you find him?

06:26.420 --> 06:28.218
Hey, no, he found me, okay?

06:28.220 --> 06:30.020
He said he saw you at the
V.A. hospital the other day.

06:33.558 --> 06:35.425
He was worried you might recognize him.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.127
He wanted to come clean about something.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.361
So he called the Times,

06:38.363 --> 06:40.196
and he got my number instead of yours.

06:40.198 --> 06:42.564
All right?

06:42.566 --> 06:44.500
Now, you want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

06:44.502 --> 06:47.036
I'm not sure.

06:47.038 --> 06:50.706
Why would someone want to
put a tattoo on your head?

06:50.708 --> 06:52.708
It doesn't make any sense.

07:00.317 --> 07:02.684
What is it? Hey.

07:02.686 --> 07:04.786
You all right?

07:04.788 --> 07:06.188
I got to talk to someone.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.722
I will... I will call you later,

07:07.724 --> 07:09.724
and I will explain
everything, all right?

07:20.369 --> 07:22.169
Mr. Lyons isn't expecting you.

07:22.171 --> 07:23.403
Oh, this won't take up much of his time.

07:23.405 --> 07:25.706
Sorry to bother you, sir.

07:25.708 --> 07:28.209
There's a Mr. Thorn here to see you?

07:28.211 --> 07:29.243
Thank you, Arlene.

07:32.214 --> 07:35.281
I need to talk to you
about Ann Rutledge.

07:38.186 --> 07:45.558
Do you have any idea... how
much danger you're in?

07:45.560 --> 07:46.592
So you believe me?

07:46.594 --> 07:48.460
Yes, I do.

07:48.462 --> 07:50.729
Ann Rutledge is more than just toxic.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.866
I believe she's a genuine psychopath.

07:53.868 --> 07:57.402
This thing goes much further
and deeper than some tattoo.

08:01.775 --> 08:04.508
It goes back decades.

08:55.591 --> 08:57.892
I think this has been
happening my entire life.

08:57.894 --> 08:59.560
I mean, she really had me believing

08:59.562 --> 09:01.195
I was the devil or something.

09:01.197 --> 09:03.464
Like, faces showing up
in... in photographs,

09:03.466 --> 09:05.900
people knowing my name,
saying things to me.

09:05.902 --> 09:07.368
The... the stuff I saw

09:07.370 --> 09:08.937
in the basement of that V.A. hospital

09:08.939 --> 09:10.504
was like something from a nightmare.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.840
That's what psychological
warfare is, Damien.

09:13.842 --> 09:19.413
She made you imagine things,
or misinterpret things.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.381
No, this was not my imagination.

09:21.383 --> 09:23.283
It was too real. It was like...

09:23.285 --> 09:25.485
The past is like a noose
around our necks.

09:25.487 --> 09:27.287
I imagine you don't remember much.

09:27.289 --> 09:28.822
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

09:28.824 --> 09:31.257
It was like a hallucination.

09:36.572 --> 09:39.572
I found trace amounts
of Apocynaceae Cetanus

09:39.574 --> 09:40.640
in your blood.

09:40.642 --> 09:43.410
- Apocynaceae...?
- Cetanus.

09:43.412 --> 09:46.846
It's a rare but powerful
psychoactive derivative

09:46.848 --> 09:49.582
that's found exclusively in plants

09:49.584 --> 09:52.452
growing in the Ecuadorian rainforest.

09:52.454 --> 09:55.588
What exactly does it do?

09:55.590 --> 09:59.591
It's used in religious
ceremonies to contact spirits.

09:59.593 --> 10:02.394
It causes intense hallucinations.

10:02.396 --> 10:04.396
It also increases suggestibility.

10:07.735 --> 10:11.337
How many times has Ann Rutledge
been in your apartment?

10:17.944 --> 10:20.945
Twice. That I know of.

10:20.947 --> 10:23.948
Is this the same Ann Rutledge
that I was speaking with?

10:23.950 --> 10:25.483
She was here?

10:25.485 --> 10:27.685
She seemed very concerned that I call

10:27.687 --> 10:30.487
what looked like a suicide
attempt an accident.

10:30.489 --> 10:34.090
Mr. Thorn, if some sort of
crime has been committed,

10:34.092 --> 10:36.460
I'm obligated to report it.

10:36.462 --> 10:38.061
We'll handle that.

10:38.063 --> 10:40.964
I hope we can count on your
testimony if it's necessary.

10:40.966 --> 10:43.032
Oh... You've been a
great help, Dr. Rose.

10:43.034 --> 10:44.868
Thank you.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.939
All that blood test proves

10:50.941 --> 10:52.808
is that there are drugs in your system.

10:52.810 --> 10:54.610
It doesn't prove who put them there.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.311
You and I know exactly
who put them there.

10:56.313 --> 10:57.747
We also know who's behind all of this.

10:57.749 --> 10:59.448
We just need to start building our case.

11:04.988 --> 11:07.422
I have to be completely honest with you.

11:07.424 --> 11:09.724
It wasn't just Ann Rutledge.

11:09.726 --> 11:13.528
I played a role, too.

11:13.530 --> 11:16.398
What are you saying?

11:18.869 --> 11:21.735
After your parents died,
your legal guardians

11:21.737 --> 11:25.038
just packed you off from one
boarding school to another.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.841
You had money. That was never an issue.

11:27.843 --> 11:30.043
But no one seemed to be taking

11:30.045 --> 11:32.546
a true parental interest in you.

11:32.548 --> 11:37.017
Except for Ann Rutledge.

11:37.019 --> 11:38.885
I thought it was coming
from a good place.

11:38.887 --> 11:40.753
So, who the hell is she?
Where's she from?

11:40.755 --> 11:42.588
That's just it... I have no idea.

11:42.590 --> 11:44.990
Her government clearances go very high.

11:44.992 --> 11:47.393
But I've never been able to verify

11:47.395 --> 11:49.495
a single thing about her history.

11:49.497 --> 11:52.498
For all intents and
purposes, she's a ghost.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.933
But she isn't.

11:53.935 --> 11:55.100
She's just a person, which
means I can bring her down.

11:55.102 --> 11:56.802
She's covered her tracks too well.

11:56.804 --> 11:58.603
The feds couldn't pin a thing on her.

11:58.605 --> 12:00.639
So, what, we just stand
here and do nothing?

12:00.641 --> 12:05.076
We don't bring in outsiders
to clean up our messes.

12:05.078 --> 12:07.846
We'll handle this in-house.

12:10.183 --> 12:13.383
I'll take care of Ann Rutledge...

12:13.385 --> 12:14.685
personally.

13:07.837 --> 13:10.505
Hey, Amani. It's me.

13:10.507 --> 13:12.573
I need you to do me a favor.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.581
I've been so worried about you.

13:28.790 --> 13:30.657
I'm fine.

13:30.659 --> 13:32.526
I'm so glad.

13:37.565 --> 13:42.768
When I heard what
happened... what you did...

13:42.770 --> 13:45.103
I couldn't believe it.

13:49.544 --> 13:52.144
I feel like my life's
been given back to me.

13:52.146 --> 13:54.612
Huh.

13:54.614 --> 13:57.181
Well, maybe it was part
of the larger process.

14:00.253 --> 14:02.687
You're maturing.

14:02.689 --> 14:04.221
Finally accepting who you really are.

14:06.893 --> 14:08.960
Who is that, exactly?

14:08.962 --> 14:12.062
I'd like to hear it from you.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.199
Is this a game?

14:16.201 --> 14:19.069
You tell me.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.978
You're the second of only two prophets

14:27.980 --> 14:30.780
whose coming is foretold in the Bible.

14:30.782 --> 14:35.985
In Isaiah 14:12, God calls
you "Son of the Morning."

14:35.987 --> 14:40.856
You bring the beginning of
an era of enlightenment.

14:40.858 --> 14:44.026
The Light Bringer.

14:44.028 --> 14:47.762
That describes you perfectly.

14:50.133 --> 14:51.733
You're lying.

14:54.938 --> 14:57.205
I met Ed Bone.

14:57.207 --> 14:59.107
Tattoo artist that gave me the 666.

14:59.109 --> 15:00.809
That wasn't a tattoo.

15:00.811 --> 15:02.610
You've been poisoning me.

15:02.612 --> 15:03.844
Making me think things,

15:03.846 --> 15:05.813
believe things that simply aren't true.

15:05.815 --> 15:06.947
I can explain.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.749
You did this to me.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.853
You had people killed. You killed Kelly.

15:12.855 --> 15:15.022
Everything I did was for you.

15:15.024 --> 15:16.924
I'm done listening to you.

15:16.926 --> 15:20.793
I'm done talking to you.
I'm done... with you.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.729
- Forever.
- You're not done. Sit down.

15:22.731 --> 15:24.964
You really think you're
my mother, don't you,

15:24.966 --> 15:26.298
you crazy, murderous bitch?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.868
You're not.

15:28.870 --> 15:31.203
She's dead.

15:31.205 --> 15:35.541
Maybe you'll have something
in common with her soon.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.079
Goodbye, Ann.

15:57.211 --> 15:58.277
It's open.

16:02.550 --> 16:04.150
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:05.813 --> 16:07.112
How you doing?

16:07.114 --> 16:09.081
I am fantastic.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.784
Really, really fantastic.

16:13.664 --> 16:15.497
Really? 'Cause it looks like

16:15.499 --> 16:17.189
you're throwing away all your food.

16:17.191 --> 16:18.757
It might be poisoned.

16:18.759 --> 16:20.358
Damien, should I call someone?

16:20.360 --> 16:22.426
'Cause this all looks really manic.

16:22.428 --> 16:23.460
No, it's all good. I swear.

16:23.462 --> 16:25.729
Want a beer?

16:39.878 --> 16:41.278
Damien, you're scaring me.

16:44.116 --> 16:46.249
Uh, I know what this looks like, but...

16:49.021 --> 16:51.021
I'm just really happy.

16:51.023 --> 16:53.756
You're happy? That's... that's great.

16:53.758 --> 16:55.958
Happy's good.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.460
The cloud of doom that
was hanging over me

16:58.462 --> 17:01.096
has finally lifted, and... I don't know.

17:01.098 --> 17:03.165
I-I feel like my life is...

17:03.167 --> 17:06.401
Maybe my life is... Is
just a normal life.

17:06.403 --> 17:09.305
So, that's what this is? You're happy?

17:13.509 --> 17:15.042
I got to be honest,

17:15.045 --> 17:16.444
I've never seen you like this before.

17:16.445 --> 17:19.380
You seem different. You
even look different.

17:19.382 --> 17:22.349
- Is that good?
- That's great.

17:37.399 --> 17:39.299
Yo, man. You left your door open.

17:43.138 --> 17:45.505
Am I interrupting something?

17:51.379 --> 17:54.213
So, listen, I did what you asked.

17:54.215 --> 17:56.315
- Got the meeting with Rutledge covered.
- Great.

17:56.317 --> 17:58.417
And then after she left, I followed her.

17:58.419 --> 18:00.019
Now, you need to see this.

18:00.021 --> 18:01.453
All right.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.189
So, there she is leaving
the restaurant, right?

18:04.191 --> 18:07.359
And I followed her towards Central Park.

18:07.361 --> 18:09.761
And then she meets up with this guy.

18:17.537 --> 18:19.337
Did you hear what they were saying?

18:19.339 --> 18:21.138
Are you kidding me? I could
barely get these shots.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.406
What's going on?

18:22.408 --> 18:25.075
I think the cloud might be coming back.

18:25.077 --> 18:26.944
This doesn't feel right.

18:26.946 --> 18:29.513
If they're both playing me,
they're working together.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.851
I just don't know why.

18:34.853 --> 18:36.853
- I think we should call the cops.
- No.

18:36.855 --> 18:38.955
If there's one thing that Lyons told me

18:38.957 --> 18:41.190
that I completely believe
it's that the cops

18:41.192 --> 18:43.793
can't do anything against
a company like Armitage.

18:46.464 --> 18:49.232
Whatever their plan is,

18:49.234 --> 18:50.499
they clearly think it's working.

18:50.501 --> 18:51.634
They don't know that I'm onto them.

18:51.636 --> 18:53.036
That buys me time.

18:53.038 --> 18:54.970
No. Dude, even if we had 100 years,

18:54.972 --> 18:56.438
we'd never have access to what we need

18:56.440 --> 18:58.206
to try to figure out what they're doing.

19:06.616 --> 19:08.150
I lost my phone.

19:08.152 --> 19:09.952
I think I may have left
it here this morning.

19:09.954 --> 19:11.286
Well, he's just at a lunch meeting.

19:11.288 --> 19:12.420
I mean, he should be back soon.

19:12.422 --> 19:13.854
May I?

19:13.856 --> 19:15.389
Uh... I could call it for you.

19:15.391 --> 19:17.491
That's what I do with mine
when I can't find it.

19:17.493 --> 19:19.060
You can just ask for my
number if you want it.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.930
Uh... I leave my phone on silent.

19:22.932 --> 19:26.434
Um... okay.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.079
So, any luck?

20:15.081 --> 20:16.481
Found it.

20:16.483 --> 20:20.884
I'll, uh, show myself out.

21:11.467 --> 21:13.467
Hello?

21:13.469 --> 21:16.470
Uh, hello. My name is Damien Thorn.

21:16.472 --> 21:18.072
What did you say?

21:18.074 --> 21:20.074
Who... who is this?

21:20.076 --> 21:21.641
Damien Thorn.

21:21.643 --> 21:25.212
That's impossible.

21:51.338 --> 21:53.405
Damien?

21:56.410 --> 21:59.978
It really is you.

22:01.248 --> 22:03.780
Oh...

22:03.782 --> 22:05.249
It's me, mom.

22:09.507 --> 22:11.207
I can't believe it.

22:13.983 --> 22:15.644
You're here. You're alive.

22:16.874 --> 22:20.349
When I think what this must
have been like for you...

22:22.074 --> 22:24.007
God...

22:24.009 --> 22:26.994
I should've been stronger.

22:26.996 --> 22:30.063
I should've come back. Maybe if I had...

22:30.065 --> 22:31.831
Why didn't you?

22:36.071 --> 22:41.541
I was still bedridden in
the clinic in Fribourg

22:41.543 --> 22:45.545
when they told me that you
and your father were dead.

22:45.547 --> 22:47.179
They said that

22:47.181 --> 22:52.318
he had gone crazy and... stabbed you,

22:52.320 --> 22:56.521
and that then the police
had arrived and shot him.

22:56.523 --> 22:59.291
It was like a nightmare.

22:59.293 --> 23:04.228
It wasn't until months later,
when I saw your graves,

23:04.230 --> 23:09.100
that I realized it was all really true.

23:09.102 --> 23:13.204
Or so I thought.

23:13.206 --> 23:16.174
And I was so ashamed.

23:18.278 --> 23:20.078
Of what?

23:20.080 --> 23:23.180
They put ideas in my head,

23:23.182 --> 23:25.282
Mrs. Baylock and the others...

23:25.284 --> 23:29.252
The way they looked at you,
and the things they said...

23:29.254 --> 23:32.489
I realize now that they were doing

23:32.491 --> 23:35.625
whatever they could to make me fear you,

23:35.627 --> 23:39.962
to make me think that there
was something wrong with you.

23:44.035 --> 23:45.368
Maybe there was.

23:48.906 --> 23:51.107
I had these impulses.

23:53.244 --> 23:55.110
I mean, when you fell over the banister,

23:55.112 --> 23:57.145
when I ran into you with my bike...

23:57.147 --> 23:59.547
No.

24:01.851 --> 24:06.087
There was never anything wrong with you.

24:06.089 --> 24:09.024
And there's nothing wrong with you now.

24:15.398 --> 24:21.035
They drugged me... This Rutledge woman.

24:21.037 --> 24:25.239
She poisoned my food. Tattooed my head.

24:25.241 --> 24:30.543
Kelly, they... They... killed her.

24:30.545 --> 24:33.012
They've been at it my whole life.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.948
I have no one.

24:35.950 --> 24:38.651
Whenever I got close to anybody...

24:38.653 --> 24:42.055
These are very sick, dangerous people.

24:42.057 --> 24:43.489
Why?

24:43.491 --> 24:47.392
Because there is nothing
more truly terrifying

24:47.394 --> 24:50.328
than somebody who really believes

24:50.330 --> 24:53.298
that their actions are
divinely justified.

24:53.300 --> 24:56.134
By heaven or by hell.

24:59.073 --> 25:00.405
It's over now.

25:04.043 --> 25:06.009
They don't know you're here.

25:06.011 --> 25:07.445
They don't know we know.

25:09.412 --> 25:11.053
I can't give you back

25:11.055 --> 25:13.322
the years that they took from us.

25:13.324 --> 25:18.861
But I promise you, I won't let
them hurt you ever again.

25:31.007 --> 25:34.476
Your father kept his
papers in the library.

25:34.478 --> 25:37.845
Journals, datebooks,
personal correspondence.

25:37.847 --> 25:41.014
We might be able to
find some information

25:41.016 --> 25:43.517
that we can use in there.

25:43.519 --> 25:45.853
There are things that you need to know.

25:45.855 --> 25:48.822
I'm afraid that everything
you've learned so far

25:48.824 --> 25:52.860
is just the tip of the iceberg.

25:59.634 --> 26:01.868
What the hell are you doing here?

26:01.870 --> 26:03.970
I need to explain things.

26:03.972 --> 26:04.971
You knew, didn't you?

26:04.973 --> 26:07.607
Yes, I knew.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.008
I've never lied to you.

26:09.010 --> 26:10.877
You've been lying to me
since the day we met.

26:10.879 --> 26:15.914
You knew all these years that
my child was still alive,

26:15.916 --> 26:17.883
and you kept us apart?

26:17.885 --> 26:19.818
There's a greater need to be served.

26:19.820 --> 26:25.056
You stole years of our
lives, and for what?

26:25.058 --> 26:28.092
Every night, I went to sleep
begging God to forgive me

26:28.094 --> 26:30.427
for not being here to protect him.

26:30.429 --> 26:32.095
From your husband?

26:32.097 --> 26:33.864
He knew the truth.

26:33.866 --> 26:35.966
You took my child away from me,

26:35.968 --> 26:37.902
and I am going to see to it

26:37.904 --> 26:41.104
that you pay for that every day
for the rest of your life.

26:41.106 --> 26:43.908
I protected him from people like you.

26:43.910 --> 26:46.475
The blind. The weak.

26:46.477 --> 26:48.444
I am his mother.

26:48.446 --> 26:49.779
Enough lies.

26:49.781 --> 26:52.048
Don't you think it's time you told him

26:52.050 --> 26:53.516
who you really are?

26:53.518 --> 26:54.784
Ha!

27:17.641 --> 27:18.874
No!

27:22.779 --> 27:25.512
Mom! Mom!

27:37.793 --> 27:40.159
I'll never tell anyone what you did.

27:40.161 --> 27:43.797
It'll be our little secret.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.711
No, don't! Stop!

29:03.460 --> 29:04.826
What are you doing here?

29:04.828 --> 29:06.495
I thought you were with your mom?

29:06.497 --> 29:08.763
- She's dead.
- What?

29:08.765 --> 29:10.899
My mother, she's dead.

29:10.901 --> 29:12.638
Oh, my God. What happened?

29:12.640 --> 29:13.771
I don't know.

29:13.773 --> 29:15.840
Rutledge was there, but...

29:15.842 --> 29:17.239
It was an accident.

29:18.650 --> 29:20.150
I am so, so sorry.

29:20.152 --> 29:22.102
This does... this
doesn't make any sense.

29:22.104 --> 29:24.004
None of this makes any sense.

29:29.045 --> 29:31.211
Maybe it's for the best.

29:33.902 --> 29:34.900
What?

29:37.205 --> 29:39.038
Well, the sad fact is

29:39.040 --> 29:42.608
that she's been dead
to you for 25 years.

29:42.610 --> 29:44.811
You've already grieved.

29:47.582 --> 29:50.250
Like with Kelly.

29:50.252 --> 29:52.251
When she died, I was devastated.

29:52.253 --> 29:53.386
But...

29:54.588 --> 29:56.188
now that she's gone,

29:56.190 --> 29:58.690
I can finally step out of her shadow.

29:58.692 --> 30:01.360
I mean, I-I love Kelly. I always will.

30:01.362 --> 30:02.895
But now...

30:02.897 --> 30:06.565
I'm getting all the things
I really want in life.

30:17.677 --> 30:23.415
I-I... They're probably looking for me.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.349
I-I got to go.

30:25.351 --> 30:26.950
No, don't go.

30:29.721 --> 30:31.455
You should stay.

30:52.977 --> 30:54.544
Yeah, we met up with them...

30:54.546 --> 30:56.712
Here you are, sir. Here.

31:26.041 --> 31:28.476
Hey, what's up?

31:34.616 --> 31:35.781
Heard about your mother.

31:35.783 --> 31:37.584
Another accident?

31:37.586 --> 31:39.785
No, uh, Ann Rutledge is... We're
not going down that road.

31:39.787 --> 31:41.754
Wait, wait, wait. She's just
right in this café right...

31:45.327 --> 31:46.526
Yeah, didn't think so.

31:46.528 --> 31:48.928
I ca... I can prove it.

31:48.930 --> 31:51.563
I can prove she's actively
trying to control my life.

31:51.565 --> 31:53.565
She has these bodyguards, right,
these... these mercenaries.

31:53.567 --> 31:54.633
Whatever you want to call them.

31:54.635 --> 31:56.468
They attacked me. Uh, the guy!

31:56.470 --> 31:57.802
The... the... The tattoo artist.

31:57.804 --> 31:59.371
Ed Bone on 116th.

31:59.373 --> 32:00.839
He can back up everything
that I'm saying.

32:00.841 --> 32:02.841
I'm not taking the bait.

32:02.843 --> 32:04.309
No, please. Okay?

32:04.311 --> 32:05.777
All we have to do is go down there,

32:05.779 --> 32:07.445
and you will see that I
am telling you the truth.

32:13.686 --> 32:15.353
Get in the car.

32:38.610 --> 32:39.976
I don't like this.

32:39.978 --> 32:41.877
Come on, we're here. Let's talk to him.

32:41.879 --> 32:43.412
Take five minutes, I swear.

33:19.582 --> 33:21.081
Oh, no.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.088
Down on the ground. Get down. Now!

33:55.586 --> 33:59.021
- Hey. I didn't do this.
- The hell you didn't.

33:59.023 --> 34:00.155
No, I know you think I
did, but I'm telling you

34:00.157 --> 34:01.189
right now that I...

34:01.191 --> 34:02.457
Telling me what? What?

34:02.459 --> 34:03.391
That your friend Rutledge did it?

34:03.393 --> 34:04.692
She is not my friend.

34:04.694 --> 34:05.931
Whatever she is.

34:05.933 --> 34:07.263
She told me you had mental problems.

34:07.265 --> 34:08.598
- That's a lie.
- Yeah?

34:08.600 --> 34:10.067
Not long ago, you told
me you were going crazy.

34:10.069 --> 34:11.367
And then you insisted

34:11.369 --> 34:13.235
that I come down here
and I see something.

34:13.237 --> 34:15.072
No, I said talk to someone.

34:15.074 --> 34:16.639
Obviously I thought he was still alive.

34:16.641 --> 34:18.639
You led me right here,
walked through that door,

34:18.641 --> 34:20.576
no hesitation, and you
showed me a dead body.

34:20.578 --> 34:22.411
Why would I do that if I killed someone?

34:22.413 --> 34:23.645
That's insane.

34:23.647 --> 34:24.646
Exactly my point.

34:24.648 --> 34:26.315
Okay. Call Ann Rutledge.

34:26.317 --> 34:29.085
Call... call John Lyons.
Call him and ask him...

34:31.054 --> 34:32.987
Uh... D-Dr. Rose.

34:32.989 --> 34:36.091
Dr. Rose at St. Simon's Hospital.

34:36.092 --> 34:37.324
I... call her.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.592
She has a copy of my blood-test result.

34:38.594 --> 34:40.494
- What blood test?
- From when I tried...

34:42.165 --> 34:44.264
- Tried to kill yourself?
- Yeah.

34:44.266 --> 34:46.634
Yeah, I know all about that, too.

34:46.636 --> 34:50.638
Right. There were signs of
hallucinogens in my blood.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.741
That's not gonna help your argument.

34:52.743 --> 34:54.341
She was poisoning me.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.944
She... she had me believing
I was the Antichrist,

34:56.946 --> 34:59.212
that people were dying all around me,

34:59.214 --> 35:00.647
that it was my fault.

35:00.649 --> 35:02.349
I happen to agree with her.

35:02.351 --> 35:03.784
I didn't kill anybody.

35:03.786 --> 35:04.852
Then why is there blood on your shirt?

35:14.918 --> 35:16.618
You're under arrest.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.653
Please! Ann Rutledge
is behind all of this!

35:18.655 --> 35:20.822
She knew! She knew he
could confirm my story,

35:20.824 --> 35:22.491
that's why she had him killed!

35:22.493 --> 35:23.958
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.493
Plead insanity.

35:25.495 --> 35:27.261
You'll have no trouble
convincing a jury.

35:27.263 --> 35:29.596
If you're lucky, you just
might get life in prison.

35:55.757 --> 35:57.424
Hey. Where are we?

36:57.047 --> 36:59.315
What's going on?

36:59.317 --> 37:04.320
You just couldn't leave
it alone, could you?

37:04.322 --> 37:06.388
You were almost free and clear.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.989
Now look what you've done.

37:07.991 --> 37:09.924
I didn't do anything. You and Rutledge,

37:09.926 --> 37:12.293
you've been working
together this entire time!

37:12.295 --> 37:15.930
Now we'll have to deal
with you in-house.

37:51.699 --> 37:52.665
Aah!

37:58.405 --> 37:59.804
Come on! Come on! Open the door!

37:59.806 --> 38:00.838
Open the door!

38:00.840 --> 38:02.707
Run!

38:33.371 --> 38:35.738
Watch it! Sedate him.

38:37.642 --> 38:39.742
Sedate him!

38:43.381 --> 38:45.582
Ambulance six, two miles out.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.917
We have a young male, attempted suicide.

38:47.919 --> 38:50.819
Hey. BP is 150/90.

38:50.821 --> 38:52.787
Hold him down. Hold his arms down.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.389
I'm trying.

38:54.391 --> 38:55.724
Sir, you're gonna be okay.

38:55.726 --> 38:57.826
- Just relax.
- Get him down.

38:57.828 --> 38:59.494
Got it. Let him go.

39:00.997 --> 39:03.732
That's good. Okay?

39:03.734 --> 39:05.767
I got it. He's good, he's good.

39:22.118 --> 39:23.916
Mom...

39:27.021 --> 39:28.921
Mom, are you okay?

39:32.327 --> 39:34.627
I'm here, Damien.

39:34.629 --> 39:36.363
It's all right.

39:41.536 --> 39:43.202
What are you doing here?

39:44.064 --> 39:46.637
I came as soon as I heard.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.549
No...

39:56.551 --> 39:58.983
The doctor says you're going to be okay.

39:58.985 --> 40:02.520
The carbon monoxide's
almost out of your body.

40:02.522 --> 40:03.721
It was a dream.

40:05.792 --> 40:06.958
A dream?

40:06.960 --> 40:08.626
Tell me, what did you see?

40:14.766 --> 40:17.301
My hands around your throat.

40:23.476 --> 40:25.942
I'm so sorry.

40:25.944 --> 40:28.812
I pushed you too hard.

40:42.026 --> 40:43.626
I wish it was real.

40:46.030 --> 40:48.830
I wish I had killed you.

40:55.272 --> 40:57.506
Get. Out.

41:00.744 --> 41:02.010
Go away.
