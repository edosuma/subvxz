WEBVTT

01:28.630 --> 01:31.633
- Evening, lieutenant.
- Louie.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.052
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

01:41.894 --> 01:45.939
Forget it, lieutenant.
Their free refills were killing me anyway.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.968
Mike Murphy been in yet?

02:15.135 --> 02:18.263
- Who?
- Murphy. Michael.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.557
I don't know him, pal.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.603
That's funny.
I hear he eats here every night.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.730
Murray, you say?

02:28.565 --> 02:33.529
Murphy, brick brain.
Your ears need unplugging?

02:35.364 --> 02:38.534
- So?
- No, he ain't been in yet.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.288
I'll wait.

03:02.641 --> 03:06.478
Damn. Damn.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.387
Hello, Louie.

03:40.762 --> 03:45.058
Got an emergency. They need
your meat loaf down at the river.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.186
The levee's got a hole in it...

03:47.352 --> 03:50.647
and meat loaf's the only thing
that can stop it up for a year.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.067
Hey.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.530
Somebody left the cage door open, huh?
It's out.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.657
What's the occasion?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.745
Archie, how you doing?

04:22.804 --> 04:26.308
- Not too bad. And you?
- Not too bad.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.185
Good.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.437
- How's the stew?
- Not too good.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.606
That's too bad.
I was counting on the stew.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.068
I had my mouth set on it.
I'll try the Ritz.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.237
- Maybe not.
- This here is Archie.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.657
Really? Ain't that peculiar?

04:42.491 --> 04:44.993
- What?
- See, Archie...

04:45.160 --> 04:47.663
we're looking for a gumshoe
named Mike Murphy.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.833
Guy about your size
with a mustache like you.

04:50.999 --> 04:55.504
Even drives a Model A Roadster like you,
with the same license plate too.

04:55.671 --> 05:01.927
- Now, ain't that peculiar?
- Yeah, that's peculiar.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.851
They're a couple of cupcakes.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.562
I guess this wouldn't work again.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.082
Oh, Speer.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.587
Lieutenant, aren't you gonna do anything?

05:38.046 --> 05:39.464
How about a refill?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.054
He can take care of himself.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.690
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
I got a situation here.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.657
I know we're not really close
anymore, but let by...

06:19.963 --> 06:21.965
- You back?
- Fuck, yes, I'm back.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.052
You know why I'm back?
Because I'm being killed.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.159
What are you gawking at?

07:07.636 --> 07:10.639
- You waiting for them to kill me?
- They competitors?

07:10.806 --> 07:13.559
Or did you have your nose
in the wrong ass?

07:13.725 --> 07:15.811
- There's plenty left for you.
- Say when.

07:15.978 --> 07:19.356
Mike, please. There's not much left.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.652
- Anytime, Speer.
- Until then, you watch your step.

07:23.819 --> 07:27.281
- You hear me?
- What are you talking about?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.993
I'm talking about rumors
of a frayed-collar peeper...

07:31.159 --> 07:33.704
trying to get in bed
with the wrong snot balls.

07:33.871 --> 07:38.500
Of course, that wouldn't be you.
You're too much of a fancy Dan.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.171
So?

07:42.337 --> 07:45.841
- I'll be watching.
- I'm shaking.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.886
So long, shorty.

07:49.887 --> 07:53.182
You pathetic son of a bitch.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.643
He's so pathetic.
I turned in my badge, you know.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.022
I got my own... I got my own office now!

08:00.189 --> 08:04.151
I got my name in gold.
You're just jealous.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.362
You're so insecure, it's unbelievable.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.201
Is this frayed?

08:18.916 --> 08:20.000
How you doing, boss?

08:20.167 --> 08:23.212
- Fine, fine, doing fine.
- Alrighty.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.925
- Keep the change.
- Thanks a million. Much obliged.

09:15.597 --> 09:20.060
The finance company just called.
Those mugs last night were after your car.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.812
Repo guys?

09:21.979 --> 09:25.023
Seems they don't enjoy their work
as much as they used to.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.944
You owe $98.98, Mike.
It's the cash or the keys.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.362
Mahoney.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.780
- Who?
- The landlord.

09:31.947 --> 09:35.617
Do I have to do everything?
I told you to send that check weeks ago.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.245
- Oh, my gosh!
- I can't stand irresponsibility.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.746
I know. I'm so...

09:39.913 --> 09:43.917
Still singing that song? Ain't never
worked. Ain't never gonna work.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.629
You remember my silent
and invisible partner, Mr. Swift.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.716
We thought you were Mahoney...

09:50.883 --> 09:53.844
president of the Landlord's
Malevolent Association.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.513
- Behind in our rent again.
- The word is "still."

09:57.472 --> 10:01.977
Tell Mr. Mahoney to fix the plumbing,
or we're gonna move to a better dump.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.396
Mike, catch me. I'm gonna faint.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.481
I suppose Murphy and Swift...

10:06.648 --> 10:09.651
are financially delinquent
with regards to their secretary.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.486
- Somewhat.
- One week, two weeks?

10:11.653 --> 10:13.488
- Three.
- For shame.

10:13.655 --> 10:17.409
- Months.
- Oh, now that's what I call loyalty.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.371
And a little bonus. How's that?

10:22.706 --> 10:25.792
Addy, take a letter somewhere.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.670
Yes, sir, Mr. Murphy. Sir.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.097
Yes.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.726
Free Spirit in the seventh.

10:44.561 --> 10:48.315
You've never been that lucky,
and you ain't that smart.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.694
- People change.
- Not you.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.698
I heard a rumor about you last night.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.700
Taletelling, Mike?

10:59.576 --> 11:02.788
- I didn't figure you were the type.
- Snot balls play hard.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.040
It warms my cockles knowing you care.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.751
You're not that good, Dehl.

11:13.048 --> 11:17.302
Hello. Hey, sugar. Fine.

11:17.469 --> 11:21.181
Tonight at 8? Okay. Bye-bye.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.600
Gotta breeze, Mike.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.270
Promises to keep and all.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.272
Oh, by the way...

11:28.438 --> 11:31.692
don't be surprised if you receive
a little bonus soon.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.402
Why would that happen?

11:33.569 --> 11:35.612
Maybe because
you're the only guy around...

11:35.779 --> 11:38.407
who's got trouble telling dark from light.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.871
- Take care of yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.750
Don't spend it all in one place.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.339
I won't even ask.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.426
- I appreciate that.
- Here.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.889
That's your bonus.

12:02.055 --> 12:06.977
I'm investing in the company.
Can't do much detecting without a car.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.064
Addy...

12:17.738 --> 12:19.364
thank you.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.297
I'll see you.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.619
It's all arranged.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.131
You must not give it
to Pitt before I've gone.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.092
Tomorrow night.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.112
Ginny, baby.

15:46.864 --> 15:52.161
If it's worth 25,000 to Primo Pitt, then
it's worth twice that much to Leon Coll.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.872
- Dehl.
- Why not?

15:56.582 --> 15:59.376
You know why not.
If you double-cross Pitt...

15:59.543 --> 16:01.545
I got protection from Coll.

16:01.837 --> 16:05.883
Now listen, when you finish here,
meet me back at my place, okay?

16:06.592 --> 16:08.135
Dehl?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.222
Please don't do this.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.683
Come on, baby, stop worrying.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.812
In 48 hours, you'll have
everything you ever wanted.

16:33.869 --> 16:38.540
Hey, sugar, cheer up. There ain't
nothing left but the good times.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.455
Hello?

17:20.082 --> 17:23.417
- Mike?
- Hello, sweetness.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.002
Guess what I'm doing.

17:25.378 --> 17:30.050
From the sound, you're either
making gin or taking a bath.

17:30.217 --> 17:34.972
Lying there all warm and soapy,
watching your pores open up.

17:35.138 --> 17:38.767
I could help. Come right over
and get those hard to reach places.

17:38.934 --> 17:43.063
Actually, I'm making a list for this party
I'm giving. Would you come?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.399
Please? I need cheering up.

17:45.566 --> 17:49.152
And I haven't smiled since last Tuesday.
Do you remember Tuesday?

17:49.319 --> 17:51.405
- Was it raining?
- Yes, it was.

17:51.572 --> 17:54.283
Maybe I'm confused. Maybe you were...

17:54.449 --> 17:56.618
Monday. Yeah, or Sunday. Yeah.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.496
- Sunday was nice.
- You bitch, I was with you Sunday...

17:59.663 --> 18:02.708
and Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.628
- Well, what happened to Thursday?
- Thursday I was in traction.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.673
Do you want to be Friday?
Come to my party.

18:10.299 --> 18:12.926
- I might be late.
- Oh, early is boring.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.972
That's why I like you so much,
because you're always so late.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.516
How about I come over and be late now?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.435
I've too much to do.

18:21.602 --> 18:22.936
Just come to my party.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.899
Maybe.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.026
Good night, luscious.

18:43.665 --> 18:48.629
Okay, I'll come over and buff your body
and bring a nice glow to your cheeks.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.173
I'll bring a nice foot to your ass.

18:52.841 --> 18:57.638
- Who dialed the phone for you, Speer?
- I've been hearing that rumor again.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.599
Once is a pain in the ass,
twice is a bore.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.392
Once is all you get, pal.

19:02.559 --> 19:06.688
I'm tired, Speer. Why don't you save
the patter for the pulp reporters?

19:06.855 --> 19:11.026
There's a good card at the arena tonight,
and I'm holding two tickets.

19:11.193 --> 19:14.655
- You think I'd go to the fights with you?
- Who invited you?

19:14.821 --> 19:20.369
- I'm calling you for Addy's number.
- Not a chance. I like the girl too much.

19:20.911 --> 19:26.291
- See you around, shorty.
- Not if I see your mug first, flatfoot.

19:44.601 --> 19:45.769
Go for the eye!

20:05.247 --> 20:08.709
Thanks for the invite, lieutenant.
I like the fights.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.336
No, honest, I really do.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.213
I love watching two sweaty...

20:13.380 --> 20:17.217
sinewy, nearly-naked guys
bounce each other around.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.220
Raises all my prurient interests.

20:21.513 --> 20:22.723
Well, that's great.

20:22.890 --> 20:26.518
You don't have to be so formal.
Why don't you call me "Speer"?

20:47.789 --> 20:49.208
Come on. Go. Go.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.130
Come on!

20:59.968 --> 21:01.386
Way to go.

21:01.637 --> 21:07.518
Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

21:07.893 --> 21:10.145
Ten. You're out.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.276
- A toast.
- A toast.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.076
- Where you going?
- One more picture over here.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.551
Better be good, sunshine.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.929
Name's not "Sunshine,"
and it's 50,000 good.

21:44.096 --> 21:45.889
Fifty thousand?

21:55.023 --> 22:00.362
- I don't like clowns, sunshine.
- Told you, my name is not "Sunshine."

22:00.571 --> 22:02.364
Spit it out or you're a memory.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.950
How does "bookkeeper" strike you, huh?

22:05.117 --> 22:08.537
- What about him?
- He sold you out.

22:09.288 --> 22:13.208
- To who?
- Primo Pitt for 25 big ones.

22:13.750 --> 22:14.793
What did he sell?

22:14.960 --> 22:17.588
A cleaver big enough
to cut yours clean off.

22:18.797 --> 22:20.591
Yeah.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.647
Pitt got the stuff?

22:36.440 --> 22:38.317
Not yet.

22:39.693 --> 22:42.988
- But you'll get it back.
- Oh, yeah.

22:43.155 --> 22:48.160
For 50,000. Half now, half on delivery.

22:49.578 --> 22:51.622
Don't got that much on me.

22:53.123 --> 22:56.543
Tell you what. The bookkeeper does.

22:56.793 --> 23:00.881
On the river. Pier 14, Star of Bolivia.

23:01.924 --> 23:05.302
Just have one of your mutts
drop it at my place.

23:10.599 --> 23:14.978
- And the goods?
- Don't worry, you'll hear.

23:16.897 --> 23:21.401
- Dehl. Dehl.
- Yeah?

23:21.902 --> 23:25.447
Cross me and you're snail food.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.348
This is crummy, Speer.

23:51.515 --> 23:55.185
I better check this out.
It may be for his own good.

25:09.176 --> 25:12.095
Look what the rat dragged in.

25:14.014 --> 25:17.184
Sugar, it's all gonna be fine.

25:21.146 --> 25:24.066
What kind of game are you playing, Pitt?

25:26.568 --> 25:28.946
Did you have a good time at the fight?

25:31.198 --> 25:33.492
- Wasn't nothing.
- Maybe not.

25:33.659 --> 25:38.247
You're in a lot of trouble, shoe fly.
Open that case.

25:44.253 --> 25:45.754
Open the case.

25:58.016 --> 25:59.726
Run!

26:01.895 --> 26:03.397
Get her!

26:10.445 --> 26:12.155
Stay there.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.377
Jesus!

26:37.806 --> 26:40.767
Come on! Come on! Come on!

28:22.411 --> 28:27.416
- Everything all right?
- All right for me, not so good for him.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.753
- He took a four-story fall.
- Fall?

28:31.920 --> 28:34.506
- He had help.
- Bastards.

28:34.882 --> 28:38.218
- Didn't know you two were so close.
- He was my partner.

28:38.385 --> 28:40.596
That's right, he was.

28:42.848 --> 28:48.395
We dug two.38s and a.45 out of
the walls, a 9 mm out of the ceiling.

28:48.604 --> 28:53.317
Now this in here was chasing Ginny Lee
when I bumped into him.

28:53.483 --> 28:58.405
- She got away.
- Vint Diestock, one of Pitt's soldiers.

28:58.572 --> 29:01.241
Dehl's gun was in his holster.

29:04.661 --> 29:08.707
- What'd you do with Addy?
- I sent her home in a patrol car.

29:08.957 --> 29:13.879
Boy, you really know how to show
a girl a good time, Speer.

29:37.361 --> 29:39.154
Mr. Coll wants to see you.

29:40.656 --> 29:43.283
Hard or easy, Murphy?

29:53.961 --> 29:56.421
Mr. Murphy.

29:56.964 --> 30:00.509
- Mr. Coll.
- Well, I'm so glad you could come.

30:00.676 --> 30:04.596
- Make yourself comfortable. A drink?
- No, thanks.

30:06.056 --> 30:08.392
Swell-looking joint you got here.

30:08.809 --> 30:11.812
- Fruits of my labor.
- Yeah.

30:13.188 --> 30:16.358
Don't tell me why you asked me up here.
Let me guess.

30:16.525 --> 30:19.987
You're a night kind of guy.
You like to invite new friends up.

30:20.362 --> 30:24.658
Chew the rag a little bit. What do
you want to gab about, fish face?

30:29.955 --> 30:34.084
- I saw your late partner tonight.
- Oh, yeah?

30:34.668 --> 30:36.587
Was that about 1:00...

30:36.753 --> 30:39.840
when he tried to fly out of the
fourth-floor window without wings?

30:40.007 --> 30:42.885
- You know I didn't dust him.
- How do I know that?

30:43.051 --> 30:46.680
Because you remember all about Mr. Pitt,
don't you?

30:46.847 --> 30:50.475
Oh, yeah. Primo Pitt. Hell of a guy.

30:51.059 --> 30:55.439
He came in second to you
in the snot-ball pageant.

30:57.232 --> 31:01.361
- You're close to a manners lesson.
- You're close to getting your ass kicked.

31:01.528 --> 31:05.741
- You want some of me, pal? Come on.
- Not now.

31:11.747 --> 31:13.957
Where do you stand, Murphy?

31:14.583 --> 31:18.170
You and Dehl, you had a fix
with Mr. Pitt, right?

31:18.587 --> 31:22.591
So, Dehl, he pulls a double-cross.

31:22.758 --> 31:25.802
Now, you in with him
or he's screwing you too?

31:25.969 --> 31:27.596
He was my partner.

31:28.430 --> 31:34.311
- He couldn't cut it. Can you?
- He was my junior partner.

31:34.937 --> 31:38.607
I taught him practically nothing
of what I know.

31:40.692 --> 31:43.487
So you'll get my goods back for me, then?

31:45.072 --> 31:49.618
Well, I didn't talk to Dehl
before he went out for some air.

31:49.827 --> 31:52.538
I don't know the financial arrangement.

31:58.752 --> 32:02.548
This now,
another like it when I take possession.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.217
Fifty thousand or forget it.

32:06.802 --> 32:08.679
Agreed.

32:08.971 --> 32:12.683
Good. Tell the little rodents
to fix me a drink, will you?

32:12.850 --> 32:14.476
Two.

34:53.635 --> 34:55.929
Wait till you see the bedroom.

35:06.857 --> 35:10.569
When was the last time
you talked to Primo Pitt?

35:13.322 --> 35:15.324
I've never talked to Primo Pitt.

35:15.491 --> 35:18.660
Well, two of his guns are parked
right across the street.

35:28.837 --> 35:30.964
- Cadillac?
- Yeah.

35:31.465 --> 35:33.425
You rate the heavy artillery.

35:34.176 --> 35:38.013
Maybe they're waiting for you.
Did you ever think of that?

35:38.180 --> 35:41.099
I ducked in the alley, came up the back.

35:41.266 --> 35:42.601
What are you drinking?

35:43.060 --> 35:45.395
Tea. I found it in the bottle
under the sink.

35:45.562 --> 35:48.482
Or what's left of your sink.
It tastes like gin.

35:48.649 --> 35:52.277
It is gin, my gin.

35:53.487 --> 35:56.323
You didn't sly up here
just to prove you're stealthy.

35:56.490 --> 35:59.535
We fished Aram Strossell
out of the river today.

35:59.701 --> 36:02.704
- Leon Coll's bookkeeper.
- A friend of yours?

36:02.871 --> 36:05.165
He was gonna do my taxes next year.

36:05.332 --> 36:08.877
He was wired to a cement block.
The wire broke, and he popped up...

36:09.044 --> 36:12.673
in front of a seafood restaurant,
much to the chagrin of the customers.

36:12.840 --> 36:16.802
- Catch of the day.
- Very funny.

36:17.594 --> 36:19.680
Want to quote me odds on the connection...

36:19.847 --> 36:22.558
between Dehl and the bookkeeper?

36:23.225 --> 36:26.520
Or the link between you and them?

36:28.480 --> 36:32.276
They dug a slug out of the mess
that was left of Dehl.

36:32.442 --> 36:35.279
It was a 9 mm.

36:35.445 --> 36:39.199
One of those wouldn't be too good
for your looks either, shorty.

36:48.584 --> 36:50.085
Duck.

37:07.895 --> 37:09.563
That's right.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.359
- Yeah?
- Roll it down further.

37:31.251 --> 37:34.004
It's against the law
to lie down in the street.

37:34.171 --> 37:38.008
- I never laid down on the street.
- Sure you did. You were hit by a truck.

37:38.175 --> 37:41.261
- What truck?
- Next one that comes along.

37:41.428 --> 37:45.349
- Look, lieutenant...
- You look. I don't like sludge like you.

37:45.516 --> 37:49.811
In fact, it wouldn't break my heart at all
to scrape the street clean of your ilk.

37:49.978 --> 37:53.315
- You know what an "ilk" is, don't you?
- A big deer.

37:53.482 --> 37:56.527
Yeah. Now, if I catch you loitering
around my precinct again...

37:56.693 --> 37:58.946
I'm gonna shoot me an ilk. You understand?

37:59.112 --> 38:01.907
All right, throw your cannons
out the window.

38:02.074 --> 38:04.743
Come on, I hear a truck coming.

38:08.038 --> 38:09.289
Good boy.

38:26.723 --> 38:30.769
Pretty stealthy, lieutenant.
Pretty stealthy.

39:07.347 --> 39:11.935
- Hello, Tuck. How you feeling?
- Good.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.730
Getting plenty of raw meat, are you?
That's good.

39:14.897 --> 39:18.150
- Say, "The Leith police dismisseth us."
- What?

39:18.317 --> 39:20.652
- It's a test they give radio announcers.
- What?

39:20.819 --> 39:22.905
- You don't wanna be a radio announcer?
- No.

39:23.447 --> 39:26.450
- C'est la vie, Tuck.
- Yeah.

39:30.871 --> 39:33.790
- Hello, Freddie.
- Well, Murph.

39:33.957 --> 39:37.753
- Care for a taste?
- I'm full of tea.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.172
You're supposed to flush that,
not smoke it.

39:40.339 --> 39:43.133
Now, don't razz my ass, Mike. I'm low.

39:43.300 --> 39:46.512
- Why?
- Ginny.

39:46.678 --> 39:49.598
I do some fine coin with her singing.

39:49.765 --> 39:51.725
She hits them notes real nice.

39:52.684 --> 39:55.354
You worried about business, Freddie?

39:56.647 --> 40:00.734
What the hell, Mike,
I never could jive you.

40:00.901 --> 40:02.903
I'm worried about her.

40:03.904 --> 40:06.907
Last night when Dehl was dumped,
he was here, wasn't he?

40:08.367 --> 40:10.953
He came here about 8:00 to see Ginny?

40:11.119 --> 40:14.957
Yeah. Ginny and the bookkeeper.

40:16.124 --> 40:20.254
Thanks a lot, Freddie.
And kill those before they kill you.

40:28.345 --> 40:31.723
- It's black tie, sir.
- Thank God I've got one.

40:33.934 --> 40:38.313
Everybody's going.
Pres, Buffy, Boo, Binky, everyone.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.148
- Well, just pull it out.
- Yes.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.276
I love it when you talk that way.

40:42.442 --> 40:46.280
He'll never know the difference if I...
Oh, Mike! Finally!

40:52.452 --> 40:54.955
- Keith, this is Michael Twitchell Murphy.
- Hi.

40:55.122 --> 40:58.667
- Where does the "Twitchell" come from?
- The milkman.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.547
- Mike, this is Keith Stoddard, Esq.
- Where's the "esquire" come from?

41:03.714 --> 41:06.133
- Mama the heiress or Papa the pirate?
- Oh, Mike.

41:06.300 --> 41:10.179
- How'd you like to step outside?
- Oh, I don't think so.

41:10.345 --> 41:14.349
See, I'm gonna go upstairs and try to put
a twinkle in both of Caroline's eyes.

41:14.516 --> 41:16.560
If I'm not too tired afterwards, though...

41:16.727 --> 41:19.062
I'll come down
and pop your face inside out.

41:19.229 --> 41:21.940
Good night, Keith.

41:44.213 --> 41:47.549
I don't know how you got in,
but you're not gonna get out so easy.

41:47.716 --> 41:53.764
Well, maybe I'll use you as a shield, blind
those goons of yours with your jammies.

41:53.931 --> 41:55.390
What do you want?

41:55.557 --> 41:58.352
They picked a 9 mm slug out of Dehl Swift.

41:58.519 --> 41:59.937
What's a Dehl Swift?

42:00.103 --> 42:02.856
You won't mind
if I take this for ballistics?

42:03.398 --> 42:05.943
You're not gonna take this gun
without a warrant.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.362
I wasn't planning to.

42:08.529 --> 42:11.490
Oh, Mother! Jesus!

42:19.748 --> 42:21.667
Just want the bullet.

42:25.087 --> 42:27.798
I'm kind of scared, Mike.

42:28.215 --> 42:30.551
It'll be light soon.

42:31.385 --> 42:34.638
I'm falling in love with you, Murphy.

42:34.805 --> 42:38.600
Real love. And it scares me.

42:40.102 --> 42:42.271
I know what you mean.

42:43.355 --> 42:45.774
Say that again.

42:45.941 --> 42:49.319
Well, I should be running.
It's getting a little late, you know?

42:49.486 --> 42:51.488
You son of a bitch!

42:52.364 --> 42:54.616
- You can't say it, can you?
- What?

42:54.783 --> 42:58.579
You tried, but you couldn't,
you big palooka!

42:58.745 --> 42:59.788
Where you going?

42:59.955 --> 43:03.292
I pour my heart out, and you put
your pants on. You dope!

43:03.458 --> 43:06.003
Big palooka-dope!

43:07.462 --> 43:09.339
Son of a bitch!

43:10.924 --> 43:13.302
Morning, angel.

43:13.468 --> 43:15.179
This just came.

43:17.639 --> 43:20.851
- It's addressed to Dehl.
- In his own handwriting.

43:21.018 --> 43:22.728
Oh, yeah?

43:35.991 --> 43:38.660
- "Majestic Pawnshop."
- This is it, boss.

43:38.827 --> 43:41.246
I see that.

43:42.789 --> 43:48.086
So after you go to the beauty shop,
you could pick up my laundry?

43:49.463 --> 43:53.050
Primo Pitt. Somebody kicked over
the rock you live under...

43:53.217 --> 43:56.136
and you had to crawl out
into the sunshine.

43:58.847 --> 44:00.766
Scram.

44:10.025 --> 44:13.946
- Your partner crossed me.
- Really? That's a shame.

44:14.196 --> 44:18.200
His squeeze or you
has got something I want.

44:18.367 --> 44:21.328
What could that be? I know.

44:21.495 --> 44:24.581
The address of a good plastic surgeon.

44:27.042 --> 44:28.877
He's a funny man.

44:29.044 --> 44:32.172
Don't matter who's got it.
You're gonna hand it over.

44:32.339 --> 44:36.468
- Why would I do that?
- Because I got something you want.

44:38.595 --> 44:42.808
The only thing I want
is to see your ass walk out of here.

44:47.271 --> 44:49.314
Phone's ringing.

44:55.946 --> 44:57.990
- Yeah?
- Mike?

44:58.157 --> 45:02.161
- I've been kidnapped.
- Where are you?

45:02.327 --> 45:05.581
This is ridiculous! What's going on?

45:05.747 --> 45:08.083
- You okay?
- Hell, no!

45:08.250 --> 45:12.546
My hair's a mess.
I broke two of my fingernails.

45:12.713 --> 45:15.340
I don't have my makeup.

45:15.507 --> 45:20.012
And I'm stuck here with these
two ugly, smelly garbage cans!

45:20.554 --> 45:21.847
Caroline.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.058
Caroline!

45:27.853 --> 45:30.606
You son of a bitch!

45:33.442 --> 45:35.110
All right.

45:36.236 --> 45:39.740
I'll give you whatever you want.
Let her go.

45:45.621 --> 45:48.832
She walks when I hold the goods.

45:48.999 --> 45:51.335
Come on.

46:10.812 --> 46:13.023
Did you tab that.45 yet?

46:13.190 --> 46:15.692
How about the 9 mm?

46:15.859 --> 46:17.319
They match?

46:21.490 --> 46:23.033
Good.

46:26.078 --> 46:29.665
Croix de Guerre. French medal of honor.

46:29.832 --> 46:32.751
When Dehl was good,
he was very, very good.

46:34.545 --> 46:37.506
Pretty fancy for the bottom
of a Cracker Jack box.

46:37.673 --> 46:38.966
I didn't hear you knock.

46:39.132 --> 46:42.344
What a relief. I thought I was going deaf.

46:43.554 --> 46:45.973
What do you want, Speer?

46:46.139 --> 46:50.853
We ID'd the .45, the 9 mm.
Dub Slack and Primo Pitt.

46:51.395 --> 46:54.356
- Is it enough to nail them?
- Not with their alibi.

46:54.523 --> 46:56.859
We need an eyewitness.

46:57.025 --> 47:00.863
That's why you will tell me
when you find Ginny Lee, right?

47:01.029 --> 47:04.366
- What makes you think I'm after Ginny?
- Questions you're asking.

47:04.533 --> 47:06.118
The places you're asking them.

47:06.285 --> 47:08.453
Always pushing people around, aren't you?

47:08.620 --> 47:09.746
Always on the prod.

47:09.913 --> 47:13.959
- That's how you do the job, remember?
- You're damn right I remember.

47:14.126 --> 47:19.381
Okay. No clinches, no rabbit punches
and please, no hitting below the belt.

47:19.548 --> 47:23.093
Now shake hands, and at the sound
of the bell, come out slugging.

47:23.260 --> 47:25.345
Anything to drink around here?

47:25.512 --> 47:30.684
We're out of tea. There's some
furniture polish under the sink.

47:30.851 --> 47:32.686
I'll get it.

47:33.729 --> 47:37.191
Why do you both go at each other
so hard? Do you enjoy it?

47:37.900 --> 47:39.401
Yeah.

47:43.614 --> 47:45.032
Hello?

47:46.074 --> 47:47.659
Hello?

47:48.744 --> 47:50.370
Hello?

47:52.915 --> 47:56.543
- One more time and I hang up.
- Mike?

47:56.710 --> 47:59.338
- Who is this?
- It's me, Ginny Lee.

47:59.505 --> 48:01.590
You all right, kid? Where are you?

48:01.757 --> 48:03.675
Mike, I got trouble. Can you meet me?

48:04.092 --> 48:07.763
- Where?
- The park. You know, the pavilion?

48:07.930 --> 48:08.972
When?

48:09.139 --> 48:10.682
When?

48:15.771 --> 48:17.981
Sick friend.

48:21.527 --> 48:24.071
Mike had to take off.

48:24.905 --> 48:27.199
- He's good at that.
- Yeah.

48:27.366 --> 48:30.619
- Care for a drink?
- Sure, why not?

48:35.123 --> 48:37.084
Thanks, lieutenant.

48:44.132 --> 48:47.261
- Really is furniture polish.
- Yeah.

48:47.427 --> 48:51.723
Shocking what Prohibition
forces people to drink.

48:53.308 --> 48:55.936
So we're back to lieutenant, huh?

48:56.103 --> 48:58.021
- It's what you are, right?
- Yeah.

48:58.480 --> 49:02.901
First, last, always,
seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

49:03.986 --> 49:07.656
Look, I'm sorry about the other night.
That wasn't too good.

49:08.657 --> 49:10.742
Forget about it.

49:12.494 --> 49:14.872
I better go.

49:15.038 --> 49:18.167
- What?
- I've gotta go.

49:19.168 --> 49:22.713
- Someday I'll figure it out.
- What?

49:24.006 --> 49:27.551
Mike's not the only one around here
who's good at taking off.

50:26.610 --> 50:30.072
Caroline Howley, the society twist.

50:31.240 --> 50:35.869
Pitt took a hell of a chance
kidnapping Randolph Howley's daughter.

50:36.036 --> 50:38.664
He must expect big things from Mr. Murphy.

50:38.831 --> 50:41.708
Like the bookkeeper's merchandise?

50:43.126 --> 50:47.005
It's time we had another meet
with Mr. Murphy.

51:47.191 --> 51:49.610
Come back for me in five minutes.

51:51.069 --> 51:52.613
Hike!

51:53.780 --> 51:57.159
Fancy seeing you here.
Well, it's a small world after all.

51:57.326 --> 51:58.827
Hike!

52:04.791 --> 52:06.877
Just leave me alone.

52:07.044 --> 52:10.839
You really should be nice to me.
You belong in the back, you know.

52:12.799 --> 52:15.260
Why don't you get
the hell out of here, huh?

52:15.427 --> 52:18.180
- Now.
- Why weren't you in the last scrimmage?

52:24.770 --> 52:27.564
I waited in the park for two hours, kid.

52:28.190 --> 52:30.526
I'm sorry, Mike.

52:30.692 --> 52:32.528
I had to be sure.

52:32.694 --> 52:35.155
Are you sure?

52:35.697 --> 52:38.367
I don't know.

52:38.534 --> 52:41.245
I don't know anything anymore.

52:43.872 --> 52:45.791
They killed Dehl.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.584
I know.

52:48.710 --> 52:51.380
You're a witness.
They're gonna try to kill you too.

52:51.547 --> 52:54.383
Sweet Jesus! What am I supposed to do?

52:54.550 --> 52:59.429
- You can call Speer.
- Oh, God. Mike, I can't do that.

52:59.596 --> 53:05.143
I know he's a bastard, but he's straight.
He's good at his job too.

53:05.769 --> 53:07.521
He'll keep you safe.

53:07.688 --> 53:12.693
You can put Pitt at the scene of
a murder. Don't you understand?

53:14.903 --> 53:19.408
- He'll kill me if I go to Speer.
- He'll kill you if you...

53:20.325 --> 53:22.744
He'll kill you if you don't.

53:24.705 --> 53:28.000
Either way, Ginny Lee Lewis is...

53:28.959 --> 53:31.837
Where are the bookkeeper's goods?
Where is it?

53:32.004 --> 53:33.714
- I don't know.
- Pitt says you do.

53:33.881 --> 53:36.925
I don't. I swear I don't.

53:38.177 --> 53:41.722
Dehl made... He made
some kind of a switch.

53:41.889 --> 53:44.850
Yeah, he was good at that.

53:45.017 --> 53:47.603
Always chasing rainbows.

53:52.024 --> 53:55.277
Ginny, did you ever see this key before?

53:56.778 --> 53:58.363
No.

53:58.739 --> 54:00.449
Damn.

54:01.283 --> 54:05.204
Did he say anything new?
Talk about anything different?

54:08.207 --> 54:12.002
He was talking about getting into shape.

54:12.169 --> 54:16.089
He said he was playing handball.
I don't know.

54:16.256 --> 54:18.300
Where?

54:18.800 --> 54:20.802
Somewhere near his place.

54:23.639 --> 54:26.308
All right, I'm gonna go now, kid.

54:29.311 --> 54:31.897
It's gonna be okay.

54:34.817 --> 54:36.652
Call Speer.

54:39.822 --> 54:42.324
Hey, you're running the wrong way.

55:29.788 --> 55:32.541
- Evening.
- Yeah.

55:33.458 --> 55:37.171
Boy, it's so cold tonight
it makes you want to be a boilermaker.

55:37.337 --> 55:40.090
And how the hell would you know?

55:42.843 --> 55:46.388
Because I was pounding a beat
when you were still peeing your pants.

55:46.555 --> 55:49.766
I used to freeze my ass off
right on the same street.

55:50.058 --> 55:52.644
So many times I thought about
becoming a boilermaker.

55:52.811 --> 55:54.688
See, I was a hotshot like you.

55:55.063 --> 55:57.816
Didn't have any respect for the badge
or the uniform.

55:58.150 --> 56:01.278
I got my own business now.
Know what I'm doing?

56:01.445 --> 56:03.155
I'm still freezing my ass off...

56:03.322 --> 56:07.868
and taking a lot of flack
from a snot-nosed rookie like you.

56:08.452 --> 56:12.122
- I'm sorry.
- Ain't we all.

56:12.664 --> 56:16.251
- You know 10th Street?
- Used to be my beat.

56:17.252 --> 56:20.422
Are there any athletic clubs around there?

56:20.589 --> 56:24.051
- Gymnasiums?
- Riverside Athletic on Broad Street.

56:26.220 --> 56:27.763
Thanks.

56:27.930 --> 56:29.806
Anytime.

56:35.771 --> 56:38.065
Oh, lieutenant, I didn't see you.

56:39.024 --> 56:41.109
Muldoon.

57:12.391 --> 57:14.560
Excuse me.

57:53.348 --> 57:55.225
Oh, my God!

58:27.341 --> 58:29.801
- Where's the locker room?
- It's over there.

58:29.968 --> 58:31.094
Thanks.

58:31.261 --> 58:33.347
Get on the heavy bag.

58:41.688 --> 58:44.233
Hey, buddy. Can I help you?

58:44.399 --> 58:46.485
Yeah, I wanna see Dehl Swift's locker.

58:46.652 --> 58:49.446
- Yeah, why?
- I'm here to pick up his stuff.

58:49.613 --> 58:52.491
I can't let you in his locker
without his permission.

58:52.658 --> 58:55.285
That'll be a little tough. He's dead.

58:55.619 --> 58:58.747
I'm the executor of his estate.

59:00.290 --> 59:03.710
- How did he die?
- Suddenly.

59:06.380 --> 59:10.092
Well, there's his locker right here, 628.

59:10.259 --> 59:11.885
Thank you.

59:15.597 --> 59:17.683
Yeah, okay.

59:30.612 --> 59:32.865
- Lt. Speer?
- Yeah.

59:33.031 --> 59:35.742
- I'm Dr. Breslin.
- Doc, how is she?

59:35.909 --> 59:38.579
She fractured the radius and ulna
on her left arm...

59:38.745 --> 59:42.583
cracked the 10th, 11th and 12th ribs
on her left side and banged her head.

59:42.749 --> 59:46.128
That could mean a concussion. So we're
gonna watch her for a few days.

59:46.295 --> 59:49.464
- Can I talk to her?
- Maybe tomorrow.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.285
Addy!

01:00:18.452 --> 01:00:22.206
I got it! I got a feeling I got it!

01:00:22.498 --> 01:00:25.292
You know how I am when I got a feeling.

01:00:32.216 --> 01:00:34.718
This is what got Strossell
and Dehl killed.

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:36.678
Mike.

01:00:39.806 --> 01:00:41.683
It's a dull knife anyway.

01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:49.608
Holy mackerel!

01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:52.861
I had no idea Dehl was in so deep.

01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:59.326
This could put Coll away forever and
change Pitt from Mr. Two to Mr. One.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:03.330
- Mike. Got some bad news.
- What?

01:01:03.497 --> 01:01:06.416
- Caroline's been kidnapped.
- How'd you find out?

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:08.585
Just heard it on the radio. You know?

01:01:08.877 --> 01:01:11.505
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:01:11.672 --> 01:01:14.049
- And that's not all.
- What?

01:01:14.216 --> 01:01:16.552
- Ginny Lee's in City General.
- What?

01:01:16.927 --> 01:01:19.596
Speer called, said she was hit by a car.

01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.473
No.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.227
- Guess I'll go home?
- No! No, no, no, stay.

01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:27.229
Furniture polish.

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:51.253
Better call Fat Freddie,
tell him about Ginny.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.546
I already did.

01:01:54.506 --> 01:01:56.425
You do good work, kid.

01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:07.769
- Hello?
- This is Pitt.

01:02:08.312 --> 01:02:11.231
I was just on my way over
to see you, Mr. Pitt.

01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:15.110
- I have the goods.
- You better not double-cross me.

01:02:15.277 --> 01:02:17.696
Why would I do
a stupid-ass thing like that?

01:02:17.863 --> 01:02:22.201
- You do, and she's dead.
- I told you, I'll bring you the goods.

01:02:22.367 --> 01:02:24.453
She better be okay.

01:02:28.123 --> 01:02:31.919
You don't hear from me by morning,
tell your friend, the cop...

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:35.255
to drag the river with a magnet.

01:02:35.422 --> 01:02:37.299
Mike.

01:02:40.969 --> 01:02:43.055
I know, kid.

01:02:48.435 --> 01:02:50.813
Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

01:03:14.211 --> 01:03:15.504
Now, Addy!

01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:20.509
Got it.

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:26.807
Help.

01:05:59.168 --> 01:06:00.544
No.

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:06.675
- I'm covered in gasoline.
- What?

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:11.638
- I'm covered in goddamn gasoline!
- Stay the hell away from me.

01:06:41.627 --> 01:06:44.630
Oh, I've been doing it all wrong.
I've been hiding.

01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:47.549
You just walk down
the middle of the street, huh?

01:06:47.758 --> 01:06:51.011
Two guys down there on the right,
and two guys on the left.

01:06:51.178 --> 01:06:54.181
There's four guys down there altogether.

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:01.897
Oh, no.

01:08:11.592 --> 01:08:13.427
Hey!

01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:16.388
We did all right, huh? What a team.

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:19.475
I start off slow,
but I had to set them up for you.

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:24.979
Don't tell me why you hit me.
Let me guess.

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:28.192
They took the tire out of your cage,
and you're peeved.

01:08:28.358 --> 01:08:30.903
You said you'd tell me
when you found Ginny Lee.

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:33.488
- I don't give a damn...
- Where you going?

01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:35.823
I got things to do and places to go, pal.

01:08:36.033 --> 01:08:37.868
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:40.078
For obstructing justice,
assaulting a police officer...

01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:44.041
disturbing the peace
and anything else I can think of.

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:46.502
They got Caroline.

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:49.630
- Who?
- Pitt.

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:54.718
Let me go. I'll wrap it up in a neat
package and give it to you, all right?

01:08:55.135 --> 01:08:57.095
What do you say?

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:05.854
- Get out of here.
- I appreciate that. I really do.

01:09:17.115 --> 01:09:19.868
Next time I see you, I'll hit you so hard,
I'll knock you...

01:09:20.077 --> 01:09:23.455
into the Stone Age, where you came from.

01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:31.046
- Hello.
- You okay?

01:09:31.255 --> 01:09:33.381
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:37.094
- In a cop car?
- My cop car.

01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:41.140
That would be nice, Speer. Real nice.

01:09:42.933 --> 01:09:45.435
How come you're not married?

01:09:45.644 --> 01:09:49.398
- How come you're not?
- I don't know.

01:09:49.606 --> 01:09:51.483
Lots of reasons.

01:09:53.277 --> 01:09:55.821
Why do you and Mike
go at each other so hard?

01:09:58.198 --> 01:10:01.034
I don't know. Lots of reasons.

01:10:19.928 --> 01:10:22.598
Five card draw.

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:25.767
Keep your shirt on.

01:10:38.489 --> 01:10:41.241
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:50.501
- Hi.
- Why did you bust my door?

01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:54.254
Nobody knocks anymore. Haven't you heard?

01:10:54.463 --> 01:10:57.007
- You're nuts, Murphy.
- Where is she?

01:10:57.216 --> 01:10:59.176
Not here.

01:10:59.384 --> 01:11:00.928
Not till I know she's safe.

01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:04.723
Exterminate this pest.

01:11:04.932 --> 01:11:06.934
Don't you want to know what's in the case?

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:12.314
- Hold it! I know what better be in there.
- Oh, that's in there.

01:11:12.523 --> 01:11:18.737
- I think you just said goodbye.
- And a little surprise just for you.

01:11:18.946 --> 01:11:21.240
- What?
- Dynamite.

01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:23.659
Dynamite?

01:11:23.826 --> 01:11:27.496
Enough to blow this garage right
over to the wealthy section of town.

01:11:28.497 --> 01:11:30.040
You're bluffing.

01:11:30.666 --> 01:11:34.878
I relax my grip and we go boom!

01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:40.175
- Blast him.
- We shoot him, boss, he relaxes.

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:42.719
Give me that.

01:11:45.055 --> 01:11:46.849
I'm calling your bluff.

01:11:49.434 --> 01:11:53.814
- I hope you like loud noises.
- Evening, gents.

01:12:02.156 --> 01:12:04.158
Shorty.

01:12:04.449 --> 01:12:05.909
Hi.

01:12:06.243 --> 01:12:09.079
Is this a private party
or can anybody attend?

01:12:09.246 --> 01:12:12.833
- I thought you were sitting this one out?
- I lied.

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:17.212
What are you pointing the gun
at the suitcase for? It's dead already.

01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:20.048
Oh, what if I shoot me a live cop?

01:12:20.257 --> 01:12:23.886
Well, that'd give the 20 officers
I have outside just cause.

01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:26.054
Check it out.

01:12:27.431 --> 01:12:29.725
- Hey!
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:12:29.933 --> 01:12:32.102
You stay where you are.

01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:36.482
Twenty cops. You're as nuts as him.

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:39.943
We're nuts? He's the one
who's got the drop on the luggage.

01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:43.238
It's all that corruption.
It corrodes their brains.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:47.576
- He says it's full of dynamite.
- Is it?

01:12:47.784 --> 01:12:52.498
Well, two sticks of dynamite
and a hand grenade.

01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:54.917
What were you gonna do
after you dropped it?

01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:58.462
- I don't know, Ollie.
- I really should go to the bathroom.

01:12:58.629 --> 01:13:00.839
- Pee in your pants.
- I did that.

01:13:01.924 --> 01:13:05.761
Nobody out there
but an old man walking his dog.

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:10.015
Two dead wise guys.

01:13:10.182 --> 01:13:13.310
Well, that old man is Sgt. Lefkowitz.

01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:16.522
Who's the guy in the dog suit?

01:13:17.022 --> 01:13:18.816
That's Connors. You remember him.

01:13:19.024 --> 01:13:21.401
Right. Short legs,
long tongue, pants a lot.

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:24.446
Okay, give me the case.

01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:28.075
- Give it to him.
- You got it.

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:36.602
- I'm out of here.
- Get up!

01:16:01.103 --> 01:16:02.104
Help!

01:16:07.651 --> 01:16:10.988
You shot Pitt. You killed him,
you big dummy.

01:16:11.155 --> 01:16:13.073
What were you shooting at me for?

01:16:13.282 --> 01:16:15.492
- You were shooting at Pitt.
- He was shooting at you.

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:18.912
I wasn't shooting at you.
I was trying to distract you.

01:16:19.163 --> 01:16:20.956
Some difference.

01:16:26.295 --> 01:16:28.797
Where's Caroline?

01:16:29.631 --> 01:16:31.884
What time is it?

01:16:32.092 --> 01:16:35.762
What the hell difference does that make
to you now? A little after 1.

01:16:35.971 --> 01:16:40.434
Two o'clock, I don't call,
she don't breath no more.

01:16:41.685 --> 01:16:44.021
This ain't so bad.

01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:48.775
You get to watch me die,
I get to watch you squirm.

01:17:00.913 --> 01:17:03.999
- Now how do we find Caroline?
- Dub and Nino.

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:07.336
What does "Dub and Nino" mean,
you closed-mouth son of a...

01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:13.425
Make that Dub.

01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:16.178
That's just terrific.
Just goddamn terrific.

01:17:16.386 --> 01:17:18.096
I figured somebody had to go down.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:20.599
Better him than you. Maybe I was wrong.

01:17:20.808 --> 01:17:23.477
How we gonna find Caroline
if you shoot the bums...

01:17:23.685 --> 01:17:26.230
- that'll tell us where she is?
- We'll get Dub.

01:17:26.438 --> 01:17:27.689
Where we gonna get Dub?

01:17:27.898 --> 01:17:30.734
Where would you go
if you had an ass load of buckshot?

01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:32.694
- Doc Loomis.
- Now you're thinking.

01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:35.322
Don't kill anybody.
Let me say this to you one more time.

01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:38.367
Do not kill anybody. Do me a favor,
don't save my life anymore.

01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:40.035
My pleasure.

01:17:42.204 --> 01:17:45.541
Speer! It's about time.

01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:49.545
She's a pal of the cop's too.

01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:56.009
We came looking for answers, but
maybe we found some insurance too.

01:17:58.303 --> 01:18:00.722
You know, this is gonna hurt.

01:18:00.931 --> 01:18:04.601
- Maybe I should give you some ether.
- No ether.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:08.397
Okay, but there's no reason
both of us should suffer.

01:18:08.605 --> 01:18:13.193
- Just get it over with.
- Patience, Dub.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.449
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?

01:18:19.658 --> 01:18:22.661
After you get the information,
then you can kill him.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:25.581
- How you been keeping?
- Not too bad. How about you?

01:18:25.789 --> 01:18:29.168
- Not too bad.
- That's good.

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:33.755
Last chance, Dub.

01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:38.177
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:44.766 --> 01:18:46.059
No!

01:18:46.268 --> 01:18:50.814
No! No! You crazy!

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.736
Yeah?

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:58.405
They still together?

01:18:58.614 --> 01:19:01.158
Murphy's still got the goods?

01:19:01.366 --> 01:19:03.660
Right.

01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:06.371
Let me guess.
We're going for a little ride.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:10.959
Look, if it's all the same to you fellas,
I think I'll just take the trolley.

01:19:11.293 --> 01:19:13.754
Didn't have any tokens anyway.

01:19:43.367 --> 01:19:44.827
Hi.

01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:46.411
- Your coat, sir?
- Thank you.

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:47.913
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:19:48.121 --> 01:19:49.665
Good to see you.

01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:52.584
Gentlemen!

01:19:52.793 --> 01:19:56.588
Peg, I want to have you meet my friend
Mr. Smith from St. Louis.

01:19:56.797 --> 01:19:59.007
- Oh, come right in, Mr. Smith.
- Thanks.

01:19:59.216 --> 01:20:02.469
We have quite a few
of your relatives here tonight.

01:20:02.678 --> 01:20:05.514
- Your 20 and 100.
- A hundred?

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:07.516
- I haven't got that much.
- I win.

01:20:07.683 --> 01:20:10.269
- The hell you do.
- That ain't the way you play.

01:20:10.477 --> 01:20:12.521
- It's table stakes.
- Whatever I got in front of me.

01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:17.526
And I got 20, 30, 35, 37,
and you're called. What do you got?

01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:19.945
A straight.

01:20:21.155 --> 01:20:22.948
Full house.

01:20:23.824 --> 01:20:25.367
All diamonds.

01:20:40.632 --> 01:20:42.342
There's a guy on the roof.

01:20:44.428 --> 01:20:46.221
Man in the doorway.

01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:54.062
Okay, we're not going to shoot anybody
until we know Caroline's all right.

01:20:54.813 --> 01:20:57.065
Right?

01:20:57.274 --> 01:20:59.401
Right.

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:08.452
Seven card stud,
deuces and one-eyed jacks wild.

01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:10.537
For Pete's sake!

01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:23.634
- Is this the place, Ollie?
- That's right, Stanley.

01:21:23.801 --> 01:21:26.094
Where do you two rum-dums
think you're going?

01:21:26.303 --> 01:21:29.223
- Is this the public library?
- Look, pal...

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:53.413
All right, what now?

01:21:53.622 --> 01:21:56.291
You can go up and take out
the goon on the roof.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.043
Why do I go up on the roof?

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:02.047
Because I'm stealthy. That means
you've gotta be agile. Right, shorty?

01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:06.552
Listen, ape face, after this is over,
I'm gonna show you how agile I am.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:11.348
- You name the time.
- I'll see you inside.

01:22:11.557 --> 01:22:16.395
Hey, Speer? Let's not kill anybody
until we get Caroline, okay?

01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:38.292
What is this?

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.336
Police business.
Take her around the block.

01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:44.840
Get your clothes off.

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:49.553
It's your bet.

01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:51.972
- What?
- You got a deuce.

01:22:52.181 --> 01:22:53.807
Not so bad now, huh?

01:22:54.016 --> 01:22:57.936
What are you doing? Go watch the window.

01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:06.653
- This bet's 50.
- Nine. King.

01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:09.990
Hey. Got a match?

01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:20.876
And an ace to the dealer. Fair bet.

01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:24.213
- Hey, I don't see Lefty.
- Probably taking a leak.

01:23:24.421 --> 01:23:26.048
- Two hundred.
- I'm out.

01:23:26.924 --> 01:23:28.300
- Call.
- Raise 100.

01:23:29.843 --> 01:23:32.179
You're raising?
You haven't got a pair showing.

01:23:32.387 --> 01:23:35.724
Well, he ain't there.
I think somebody ought to go and check.

01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:04.711
What are you talking about? What's that?

01:24:09.633 --> 01:24:10.884
All right.

01:24:13.595 --> 01:24:15.639
- Your jacket?
- I can't give you my jacket.

01:24:15.848 --> 01:24:19.351
- And why not?
- Because I've got a gun right here.

01:24:21.395 --> 01:24:24.773
Hello, lieutenant. Since when
do you have the cathouse detail?

01:24:24.982 --> 01:24:27.985
I want you, your girls and customers
on the street in five minutes.

01:24:28.193 --> 01:24:31.446
I'm entertaining two congressmen
and a superior court judge.

01:24:31.655 --> 01:24:34.408
- And a kidnap victim.
- Primo didn't give me any choice.

01:24:34.575 --> 01:24:37.661
- Primo's dead.
- We can be out of here in two minutes.

01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:39.079
Where's the girl?

01:24:39.288 --> 01:24:41.290
End of the hall,
facing the street, upstairs.

01:24:41.498 --> 01:24:42.541
How many guns?

01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:46.128
Four upstairs, one across the street,
one on the roof, one shooting pool.

01:25:00.184 --> 01:25:04.480
- How about a fast game of sleeper?
- Never heard of it.

01:25:04.688 --> 01:25:10.027
Well, it's simple. You go ahead and
make your shot, and I put you to sleep.

01:25:16.575 --> 01:25:17.826
Okay.

01:25:27.753 --> 01:25:30.005
I'm agile.

01:25:39.223 --> 01:25:43.352
Who appointed him the boss anyway?

01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:49.107
My, Granny, what big eyes you have.

01:25:49.775 --> 01:25:55.113
My, Granny, what big ears you have.

01:25:55.322 --> 01:25:56.448
My, Granny...

01:26:02.079 --> 01:26:04.206
- Murphy!
- Hi, Marie.

01:26:04.414 --> 01:26:05.874
What the hell you doing?

01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:10.087
I'm gonna do to a couple of mugs what
you're gonna do to the congressman.

01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:12.673
Are you ready?

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.219
- Six nines.
- Five queens.

01:26:17.678 --> 01:26:20.430
Hold it, Barney. You can't have six cards.

01:26:20.639 --> 01:26:23.225
- The hell I can't.
- Only five cards count.

01:26:23.433 --> 01:26:25.853
- Not in this game.
- In any poker game.

01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:28.730
This ain't any poker game.
This is her dumb game.

01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:30.983
Dumb deuces, one-eyed jacks.

01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:34.528
I don't know if I'm winning
or losing this dumb game.

01:26:46.874 --> 01:26:51.253
Oh, so big, so strong.

01:27:05.142 --> 01:27:10.147
- No, no, I don't want the animal thing.
- Oh, sorry. Keep it up.

01:27:12.816 --> 01:27:14.818
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

01:27:15.027 --> 01:27:17.154
- That's everybody but the second floor.
- Good.

01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:20.115
Not too much breakage, please.

01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:24.453
Will that make it 40? I raise.
I raise you, Barney, all the time.

01:27:24.661 --> 01:27:26.705
- What the...?
- What are you doing?

01:27:26.914 --> 01:27:28.290
Take a walk. Wrong room.

01:27:28.499 --> 01:27:30.834
- I raised over here.
- You bet. Let's go.

01:27:31.043 --> 01:27:33.378
- Hey, baby.
- You hear? I said, take a walk!

01:27:33.587 --> 01:27:37.341
I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house down!

01:27:53.398 --> 01:27:56.235
Hold it. Hold it! Later, Speer, later!

01:28:14.419 --> 01:28:15.504
Boys.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:28.100
Well, it's about time!

01:28:34.231 --> 01:28:37.151
Michael Twitchell Murphy,
I'm getting scared again.

01:28:37.317 --> 01:28:40.654
- No, it's all over now.
- No, I don't mean gangsters.

01:28:40.863 --> 01:28:43.949
I'm really getting scared, Mike.

01:28:44.575 --> 01:28:50.497
- I'm a little terrified myself.
- So, what do we do about it?

01:28:55.419 --> 01:28:57.296
Get that camera out of here.

01:28:57.754 --> 01:28:59.381
All right. Let's go.

01:29:03.802 --> 01:29:05.345
I want my goods.

01:29:23.864 --> 01:29:25.407
Hold it.

01:29:30.954 --> 01:29:33.165
You call it.

01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:42.341
Let him have it.

01:29:43.967 --> 01:29:45.928
Easy.

01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:07.282
Sooner or later, I'm gonna get those rats.

01:30:07.491 --> 01:30:09.618
I got a feeling it's gonna be sooner.

01:30:19.002 --> 01:30:23.799
- I thought you said you defused that.
- I lied.

01:30:55.414 --> 01:30:57.416
Sit right here, lieutenant.

01:30:59.084 --> 01:31:02.796
- Speer, you amaze me.
- Thank you, my dove.

01:31:18.228 --> 01:31:20.397
Madam.

01:31:24.234 --> 01:31:29.156
Hi, Addy. You know,
I been thinking it over, and...

01:31:29.364 --> 01:31:30.824
we make a pretty fair team.

01:31:31.575 --> 01:31:33.952
Yeah, I suppose so, shorty.

01:31:34.953 --> 01:31:37.498
All right, that tears it.

01:31:37.706 --> 01:31:40.876
Step out here, brass ass,
and let's settle this right now.

01:31:41.084 --> 01:31:43.378
Hey, pal! Pipe down and then sit down.

01:31:43.587 --> 01:31:44.880
- Down in front.
- Sit down!

01:31:45.088 --> 01:31:49.718
Hey, pal, when you talk to me, stand up.
Sorry, you are standing.

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:53.430
No reason to kneel. We're not in church.

01:31:53.764 --> 01:31:57.476
Oh, boy! We can play ball.
We got three bases.

01:32:00.103 --> 01:32:01.730
Play ball.

01:32:15.369 --> 01:32:20.415
This is either the Woolworth building,
in which case it's okay, or...

01:32:20.624 --> 01:32:23.460
"The Leith police dismisseth us."

01:32:32.803 --> 01:32:34.930
Aren't you gonna help him?

01:32:35.139 --> 01:32:37.599
I abhor violence.

01:32:39.685 --> 01:32:43.021
"The Leith police dismisseth us."

01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:47.693
- I got a situation here.
- So?

01:32:48.026 --> 01:32:49.278
That's it.

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:02.666
I'll take it from here.
Good luck in your radio career.

01:33:02.875 --> 01:33:06.086
Where we going?
Out there, huh? Fine with me.

01:33:06.295 --> 01:33:09.214
I need a lot of room for you, pal. Yeah.

01:33:09.423 --> 01:33:11.508
I looked up "Neanderthal"
in the dictionary.

01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:13.760
There was a picture of you.

01:33:13.969 --> 01:33:15.762
Whereabouts?

01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:18.640
- Right here.
- That's good for me.

01:33:19.349 --> 01:33:21.351
I don't know what Addy sees in you.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.562
You know, she should go out with humans.

01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:25.314
I was wrong.

01:33:25.522 --> 01:33:29.318
- What?
- You can't take care of yourself.

01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:34.323
They wrote a song about you.

01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:37.576
"Brother, Can You Spare a Brain?"

01:33:37.784 --> 01:33:40.704
- You want to know something?
- What?

01:33:40.913 --> 01:33:44.625
You'll always be "shorty" to me.
