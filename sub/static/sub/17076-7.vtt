WEBVTT

00:00.516 --> 00:01.491
Everybody, this is my stepson, James.

00:01.492 --> 00:03.243
He's gonna spend a
couple of shifts with us,

00:03.245 --> 00:04.911
see if the job is right for him.

00:06.696 --> 00:09.363
- How's he looking?
- Truthfully, Chief?

00:09.365 --> 00:11.916
I think he'd rather
be anywhere but here.

00:11.918 --> 00:14.452
- Hey, there.
- I am a good girl.

00:14.454 --> 00:17.004
I didn't kiss a boy until I was 17,

00:17.006 --> 00:18.840
and sex... waiting till you get married?

00:18.842 --> 00:21.292
No chance in hell.

00:27.050 --> 00:29.383
So, this guy behind us in line,

00:29.385 --> 00:32.103
he's making a big show
because we're costing him

00:32.104 --> 00:33.888
a precious five minutes of his life

00:33.890 --> 00:37.391
'cause my date here is trying
to decide between rocky road

00:37.393 --> 00:39.310
and cookies and cream.

00:39.312 --> 00:40.528
I'm getting ready to confront the guy

00:40.530 --> 00:42.897
but before I can...

00:42.899 --> 00:45.233
This one says. Tell 'em what you said.

00:45.235 --> 00:46.901
I-I told him,

00:46.903 --> 00:48.870
"there are 31 flavors,

00:48.872 --> 00:50.738
and now I'm gonna sample every one."

00:50.740 --> 00:53.875
That is exactly what she'd do.

00:53.877 --> 00:56.661
Hey, did you fill in Brett
on next weekend's festivities?

00:56.663 --> 00:59.213
- No.
- No.

00:59.215 --> 01:01.382
It's their parents' anniversary party.

01:01.384 --> 01:04.385
I'm already roped in. Run
while you still can, Sylvie.

01:04.387 --> 01:06.137
- Shut up.
- You're gonna love it.

01:06.139 --> 01:07.421
My parents do it every ten years,

01:07.423 --> 01:09.340
and the whole family comes. It's...

01:09.342 --> 01:10.508
- It's great.
- I mean, you know,

01:10.510 --> 01:13.427
if you got nothing else
to do on a Saturday...

01:13.429 --> 01:16.314
I'm gonna have to check my calendar.

01:16.316 --> 01:17.565
You are so cute.

01:20.436 --> 01:23.437
It's been great having you around, son.

01:23.439 --> 01:26.657
- It feels right.
- It does.

01:26.659 --> 01:28.609
Maybe it can be permanent.

01:28.611 --> 01:30.611
- Come again?
- I can tell Mom

01:30.613 --> 01:32.947
I wanna finish out my
senior year at your house.

01:32.949 --> 01:34.615
It's not that much more
of a commute for me,

01:34.617 --> 01:36.367
and I don't mind waking up early.

01:36.369 --> 01:38.336
Well, that would be nice,
but you know your mother.

01:38.338 --> 01:39.954
I know.

01:39.956 --> 01:43.791
But we can just ask
her. See what she says.

01:43.793 --> 01:46.127
Absolutely.

01:46.129 --> 01:47.962
We'll give it a shot.

01:47.964 --> 01:49.263
All right.

01:49.265 --> 01:51.465
No, seriously.

01:51.467 --> 01:53.434
Um, what... what is this party?

01:53.436 --> 01:55.019
It's what I said.

01:55.021 --> 01:58.639
A celebration of life
and love and happiness.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.524
Your whole family gawking at me.

02:00.526 --> 02:02.977
They're harmless.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.227 --> 02:36.594
- You got a sec?
- Yeah, what's up?

02:36.596 --> 02:39.764
It's about James.

02:39.766 --> 02:42.767
Squad 3, Truck 81, Ambulance 61,

02:42.769 --> 02:44.902
- accident, 341 W. Ohio.
- To be continued.

03:07.844 --> 03:10.812
Look, the place is chained up.
I just work the parking lot.

03:10.814 --> 03:12.146
I don't even have a key,

03:12.148 --> 03:14.682
but then I saw that.

03:14.684 --> 03:16.350
There been some kind of accident?

03:16.352 --> 03:19.237
I heard kids inside screaming.

03:19.239 --> 03:21.022
Herrmann, bolt cutters.

03:31.534 --> 03:34.452
Please, help me.

03:34.454 --> 03:36.754
Help!

03:36.756 --> 03:38.873
Help me.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.709
Please. Help me.

03:41.711 --> 03:43.211
Hey.

03:43.213 --> 03:44.712
Help me.

03:44.714 --> 03:47.131
What happened, bud?

03:47.133 --> 03:50.351
Wiley and I were playing avengers and...

03:50.353 --> 03:51.853
We jumped.

03:51.855 --> 03:53.888
- Wiley?
- Where's Wiley?

03:53.890 --> 03:56.974
He's over there. He stopped moving.

04:01.231 --> 04:04.232
Up there.

04:30.608 --> 04:32.024
Can you tell me what's hurting?

04:32.026 --> 04:34.827
My... my knees. Is Wiley okay?

04:37.582 --> 04:38.697
They're gonna get to him.

04:38.699 --> 04:41.283
Wiley!

04:41.285 --> 04:43.619
I'll hold him up to get
his blood circulating.

04:43.621 --> 04:45.704
Got it.

04:59.303 --> 05:01.470
This foot's wedged in here good.

05:04.308 --> 05:05.891
If the ankle breaks, it breaks.

05:05.893 --> 05:08.561
He's not breathing.

05:08.563 --> 05:10.529
I got... I got him.

05:10.531 --> 05:12.448
Got him.

05:13.484 --> 05:16.986
Careful, careful.

05:16.988 --> 05:18.571
I got him. I got him.

05:18.573 --> 05:20.489
- Mouch.
- I got him.

05:21.576 --> 05:23.659
- Okay, got it.
- Got it.

05:25.663 --> 05:27.713
Watch his head.

05:38.676 --> 05:41.644
Come on, Wiley.

05:42.563 --> 05:44.980
Come on now.

05:47.185 --> 05:49.435
I got him.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.526
Thank god.

05:58.779 --> 06:01.197
Ready? And lift.

06:09.624 --> 06:11.707
Okay.

06:20.051 --> 06:22.551
Nice work.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.637
You too.

06:42.677 --> 06:44.010
Hey, Otis.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.428
Hey, Kidd.

06:45.430 --> 06:47.097
You got a sec?

06:47.099 --> 06:48.398
Yeah.

06:48.580 --> 06:52.415
- What's up, Herrmann?
- I need a favor.

06:52.417 --> 06:54.617
Yeah, anything.

06:54.619 --> 06:56.169
I like to hear you say that.

06:56.171 --> 06:58.087
Okay, so I signed us up

06:58.089 --> 07:01.007
as sponsors for the
mud-hundred, all right?

07:01.009 --> 07:04.294
And I need you guys to cover the event.

07:04.296 --> 07:06.679
- The what now?
- It's some kind of thing

07:06.681 --> 07:08.298
where you... you run through the mud

07:08.300 --> 07:09.632
in the woods or something,

07:09.634 --> 07:11.184
and we're gonna be handing
out Molly's t-shirts

07:11.186 --> 07:12.435
'cause we need as much, you know,

07:12.437 --> 07:14.053
publicity as we can get these days.

07:14.055 --> 07:16.055
Why aren't you covering it?

07:16.057 --> 07:18.558
'Cause I'm the brains of the operation,

07:18.560 --> 07:21.311
and you are the brawn, okay?

07:21.313 --> 07:23.896
Make Molly's proud.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.709
Hey, Lieutenant?

07:36.711 --> 07:38.661
Yeah, what's up?

07:38.663 --> 07:40.246
Something about James?

07:40.248 --> 07:42.332
I saw him getting dressed today.

07:42.334 --> 07:44.667
He had bruises all over his body,

07:44.669 --> 07:46.085
and it's not like he fell, either.

07:46.087 --> 07:47.837
It was like someone had
been working him over.

07:47.839 --> 07:50.006
- Damn.
- You talk to the chief?

07:50.008 --> 07:51.557
I wanted to talk to you first.

07:51.559 --> 07:53.009
I mean, he's 17. You know,

07:53.011 --> 07:54.727
if he's fighting in school,
that explains why he wants

07:54.729 --> 07:56.346
to spend so much time here,

07:56.348 --> 07:59.015
but I shouldn't stick my nose
in if he's bonding with Boden

07:59.017 --> 08:00.817
and he's gonna reach
out to him on his own.

08:00.819 --> 08:02.568
Nah, I'll...

08:02.570 --> 08:04.821
- I'll talk to him.
- Chief is gonna notice...

08:04.823 --> 08:07.190
James, I mean. Discreetly.

08:07.192 --> 08:09.158
I'll see what's up. Go from there.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.362
Yeah, okay. That'll be good. Thanks.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.949
Is it too much too soon?

08:16.951 --> 08:18.368
'Cause I haven't even
met your parents yet,

08:18.370 --> 08:21.371
and I'm coming with their son
to their anniversary party.

08:21.373 --> 08:23.006
- Be honest.
- Hey, you don't wanna come,

08:23.008 --> 08:25.291
- don't come.
- No, no, no, I-I do wanna come.

08:25.293 --> 08:28.711
I just feel like your
cousins and aunts and nieces

08:28.713 --> 08:31.881
are gonna be like,"
who's Antonio's new girl?"

08:31.883 --> 08:33.299
You kidding?

08:33.301 --> 08:35.768
They don't even know
that he got divorced.

08:35.770 --> 08:38.104
What I mean is that we're...
We're not the kind of family

08:38.106 --> 08:39.389
that's in each others
business. You know?

08:39.390 --> 08:41.607
This is a feel-good once-a-decade party.

08:41.609 --> 08:45.561
Everyone's drunk before 8:30. Trust me.

08:45.563 --> 08:48.564
Could... could we have
a little pre-party?

08:48.566 --> 08:51.401
Do a little pre-drinking?

08:51.403 --> 08:52.985
Thanks. I don't know.

08:52.987 --> 08:54.904
That date the other night,
it felt a little weird to me.

08:54.906 --> 08:57.540
I mean, my partner and my brother,

08:57.542 --> 08:59.409
holding hands, kissy face.

08:59.411 --> 09:02.578
Well, you... you just said
that your family doesn't

09:02.580 --> 09:05.498
- get up in each other's business.
- That's different.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.250
We're here for Wiley Lowendowsky.

09:07.252 --> 09:09.585
He was in an accident.
We're his parents.

09:09.587 --> 09:11.003
He's in the ICU. Second floor.

09:11.005 --> 09:13.089
- Take the elevator to your left.
- Thank you.

09:13.091 --> 09:15.174
Wiley, that's... that's
the kid who was hanging

09:15.176 --> 09:17.176
- in the warehouse?
- Yeah.

09:17.178 --> 09:19.562
How is he?

09:19.564 --> 09:21.564
He went into a coma on the way to Med.

09:21.566 --> 09:23.232
They say he was hanging
upside down for too long.

09:23.234 --> 09:25.068
Cardiac arrest.

09:26.237 --> 09:29.272
- He gonna make it?
- They don't know.

09:29.274 --> 09:32.191
- I thought we got him in time.
- You did.

09:32.193 --> 09:35.161
He wouldn't be alive this
long if it wasn't for you.

09:36.698 --> 09:40.083
Keep me posted next
time you go on a run.

09:40.085 --> 09:42.118
- Yeah.
- Of course.

09:52.797 --> 09:54.514
Hell of a call.

09:54.516 --> 09:56.632
Yeah, you guys get those a lot?

09:56.634 --> 09:58.885
- More than I like.
- Kids?

09:58.887 --> 10:02.021
Sometimes. Those are the hard ones.

10:02.023 --> 10:03.806
I don't know how you guys deal.

10:03.808 --> 10:06.225
I wonder that myself.

10:06.227 --> 10:09.979
James...

10:09.981 --> 10:11.731
You all right?

10:11.733 --> 10:14.784
Yeah.

10:14.786 --> 10:16.819
I mean in general.

10:22.210 --> 10:23.876
I'm good. Really.

10:27.832 --> 10:30.716
Squad 3, vehicle accident.
511 S. Desplaines.

10:30.718 --> 10:33.002
That's us.

10:44.733 --> 10:45.815
You all right?

10:45.817 --> 10:47.817
Hey, she came up on me.

10:47.819 --> 10:50.320
Women don't know how to drive.

10:50.322 --> 10:51.988
- Tony, jaws.
- Right.

10:51.990 --> 10:53.323
Hey, get back, sir.

10:53.325 --> 10:55.241
Anyone see it? It was her fault.

10:55.243 --> 10:58.494
It was her fault!

10:58.496 --> 11:01.164
Back. We need room to work here.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.217
James, hey. Get him back.

11:04.219 --> 11:06.302
- Yeah, move.
- Can you step back, sir?

11:06.304 --> 11:08.004
- What?
- Give 'em some room.

11:08.006 --> 11:09.422
Don't... don't tell me what to give 'em.

11:09.424 --> 11:12.008
It was that bitch's fault right there.

11:19.267 --> 11:21.985
Hey! Hey!

11:32.742 --> 11:34.041
Hey.

11:34.043 --> 11:36.160
- Enough!
- Let go of me...

11:36.162 --> 11:38.362
- Get off of him! Enough!
- Let go of me! He cut us off!

11:41.133 --> 11:42.967
Enough!

11:42.969 --> 11:44.468
Come on.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.503
Settle down.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.180
Okay, easy, easy, come on.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.574
You okay?

12:09.695 --> 12:11.328
You good?

12:11.330 --> 12:13.864
You good here?

12:15.368 --> 12:17.952
Load back up.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.379
Not stew.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.214
Hey, I worked hard on that.

12:30.216 --> 12:32.683
Yeah, like you did last time you cooked.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.219
- It's your one thing.
- Well, when it's working.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.388
- It's not.
- Then don't eat it.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.057
Hey, you know, the mud run said

12:40.059 --> 12:43.694
if you two wanna run
the race, it's wide open.

12:45.815 --> 12:48.065
I bet you a mud-hundred dollars

12:48.067 --> 12:50.067
- I kick your ass on that trail.
- What?

12:50.069 --> 12:52.319
- No.
- 50 on Otis.

12:52.321 --> 12:56.123
I'll take that bet.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.375
Well, then, um...

12:58.377 --> 13:01.879
I'll see you at the starting line.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.130
Prepare

13:03.132 --> 13:06.050
to get dirty.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.801
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:07.803 --> 13:10.754
Don't forget to give out t-shirts.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.848
Yeah, I gotta go.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.184
You are not gonna believe this one.

13:24.186 --> 13:27.237
The Department is sending
over recipe recommendations

13:27.239 --> 13:29.356
- for healthier food options.
- Yeah?

13:29.358 --> 13:32.526
Some new initiative from
the Health and Human services

13:32.528 --> 13:36.280
to reduce waistlines and boost energy.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.082
- What'd you tell 'em?
- I asked if they were gonna

13:38.084 --> 13:39.783
send someone over to cook it too

13:39.785 --> 13:42.119
'cause ain't no one here
putting kale in anything.

13:44.173 --> 13:47.257
I do something for you, Kelly?

13:50.796 --> 13:53.547
You got a read on James?

13:53.549 --> 13:56.633
He mention anything about
trouble at school or anything?

13:58.387 --> 14:01.138
What're you getting at?

14:01.140 --> 14:03.273
Cruz saw him changing out.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.692
Said he had bruises on him.

14:04.694 --> 14:07.311
Then at a call, two idiots got into it

14:07.313 --> 14:10.364
and James' reaction was...

14:12.234 --> 14:13.817
Scared.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.619
It's probably nothing.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.871
Did jump off fast,

14:17.873 --> 14:19.707
but...

14:22.378 --> 14:24.378
Thanks for looking out.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.330
Always, Chief.

14:38.227 --> 14:41.061
- A red tie.
- Excuse me?

14:41.063 --> 14:43.981
Are you the, firefighters
who helped my boy?

14:43.983 --> 14:46.567
Wiley.

14:46.569 --> 14:48.986
Yes...

14:49.905 --> 14:52.856
We were on scene. Um...

14:52.858 --> 14:54.441
How's he doing?

14:54.443 --> 14:56.744
Well, he's hanging in there.

14:56.746 --> 14:58.829
My wife says I'm a nervous wreck,

14:58.831 --> 15:02.449
and to take a walk to get some air.

15:02.451 --> 15:05.536
I didn't know where to go.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.960
So I wanted to get you guys something.

15:12.962 --> 15:15.879
Show our appreciation for what you did.

15:15.881 --> 15:19.099
You didn't have to do that.

15:19.101 --> 15:21.602
Did you... you see him?

15:21.604 --> 15:23.554
Before he...

15:23.556 --> 15:24.805
Before they...

15:24.807 --> 15:26.356
I gave him CPR.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.059
He was breathing when
the medics arrived.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.728
Did he say anything?

15:31.730 --> 15:34.031
No, sir.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.200
I told him...

15:36.202 --> 15:38.402
We told him never to play in there,

15:38.404 --> 15:42.039
but he... he's got this
imagination as big as the sky.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.541
Hey, it's not your fault.

15:44.543 --> 15:45.826
Kids are kids.

15:45.828 --> 15:47.578
They don't think beyond
what they're doing

15:47.580 --> 15:50.297
in the present moment.

15:51.634 --> 15:54.918
Well, I just wanted,
to thank you again.

15:55.838 --> 15:57.588
What you guys do,

15:57.590 --> 15:59.256
nobody knows

15:59.258 --> 16:02.009
until it happens to them.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.767
That breaks my heart.

16:20.412 --> 16:23.947
What's up?

16:23.949 --> 16:26.700
Warehouse rescue.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.337
Yeah?

16:31.290 --> 16:34.341
Did I not move fast enough?

16:35.711 --> 16:38.962
Did I not hold him up high enough?

16:39.882 --> 16:41.431
Did I do too many compressions?

16:41.433 --> 16:42.966
Not enough compressions? I...

16:42.968 --> 16:45.135
Casey.

16:45.137 --> 16:48.105
I was there. You were unstoppable.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.558
You didn't quit until
that kid was breathing.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.777
Anything that happened after that

16:53.779 --> 16:56.813
has nothing to do with our rescue.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.323
He's in a coma.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.332
I heard.

17:54.590 --> 17:56.840
Heard you had a rough one yesterday.

17:57.927 --> 17:59.843
Seems like there's a lot of rough ones.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.095
Some shifts more than others.

18:02.097 --> 18:03.547
I like this.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.015
I like it here.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.017
Yeah?

18:07.019 --> 18:08.885
The guys here.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.388
What you all do...

18:11.390 --> 18:13.557
It makes a difference.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.642
Yeah.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.480
Hey, can you drop me off at home

18:20.482 --> 18:21.865
so I can start getting ready?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.700
And then you can go
get the dry cleaning.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.152
You're gonna start getting ready now?

18:25.154 --> 18:27.237
The party's in 12 hours.

18:27.239 --> 18:30.991
- Aww, you sweet, sweet man.
- What?

18:30.993 --> 18:33.460
I know you think this is all
just as natural as sunshine,

18:33.462 --> 18:35.963
but there is heavy lifting to be done.

18:35.965 --> 18:38.248
Anything else while I'm out?

18:38.250 --> 18:41.551
I wouldn't be opposed
to flowers and chocolates.

18:41.553 --> 18:42.886
I thought we were giving your parents

18:42.888 --> 18:44.805
that gift certificate.

18:44.807 --> 18:47.591
Not for them, babe.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.394
If neither of 'em finishes, bet's off.

18:50.396 --> 18:53.180
I'm gonna finish. Don't you worry.

18:53.182 --> 18:55.599
Have you done this before?

18:58.904 --> 19:00.771
I'm gonna change my bet to 200.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.606
Come on!

19:02.608 --> 19:04.574
- Fine.
- All right.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.197
Okay.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.367
- Hi.
- Aww, so sweet.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.835
Are those for me?

19:14.837 --> 19:17.120
I was down the street picking
up some flowers for Gabby

19:17.122 --> 19:18.338
and thought I'd just stop in,

19:18.340 --> 19:20.257
see how that patient, Wiley, is doing.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.126
The kid from the warehouse accident.

19:23.128 --> 19:24.961
He...

19:24.963 --> 19:27.681
He passed away last night.

19:31.353 --> 19:32.602
I'm so sorry.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.770
No, no.

19:33.772 --> 19:34.938
- Maggie?
- Yeah?

19:34.940 --> 19:36.189
Dr. Halstead needs you upstairs.

19:36.191 --> 19:38.642
Copy.

19:38.644 --> 19:41.228
You did all you could.

19:42.865 --> 19:45.949
And you gave the family
a chance to say good-bye.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.903
- Thanks.
- Okay.

20:13.676 --> 20:15.511
- How many?
- Hey, um...

20:15.513 --> 20:18.263
Wallace?

20:20.067 --> 20:22.434
Shonda.

20:22.436 --> 20:25.237
Is there someplace that we could...

20:25.239 --> 20:27.439
Talk?

20:27.441 --> 20:30.359
I didn't realize you were
in the restaurant business.

20:30.361 --> 20:32.778
It's Todd's. He owns the place.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.530
I just help out with the books.

20:34.532 --> 20:35.998
That's the new boyfriend.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Well, it's more than
that. We moved in together.

20:38.002 --> 20:40.035
Yeah, I heard. I'm happy for you.

20:40.037 --> 20:42.538
- That's great.
- He's great.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.591
Treats me like a human being.

20:46.710 --> 20:49.211
Listen. About Jimmy.

20:49.213 --> 20:51.513
He's saying that he wants
to finish out his senior year

20:51.515 --> 20:52.714
under our roof.

20:55.019 --> 20:57.436
Well, to be honest with you,
he's barely at home these days,

20:57.438 --> 21:00.272
barely talks to me, so...

21:00.274 --> 21:02.441
Maybe some time with
you is what he needs.

21:02.443 --> 21:05.527
Really?

21:08.399 --> 21:11.400
You must be Wallace.

21:11.402 --> 21:13.068
Todd Preston.

21:13.070 --> 21:14.536
Just wanted to introduce myself,

21:14.538 --> 21:16.405
see if I can get you
a glass of something

21:16.407 --> 21:18.073
or some cheesy bread.

21:18.075 --> 21:20.075
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

21:20.077 --> 21:21.743
- Need anything, babe?
- We're good.

21:21.745 --> 21:25.464
- All right.
- Then I'll leave you two to it.

21:27.418 --> 21:30.002
Anything else?

21:32.056 --> 21:34.556
You ever hear of James
in any trouble at school?

21:34.558 --> 21:36.225
His grades are As and Bs,

21:36.227 --> 21:38.310
and he hangs out with a
pretty tame group of boys.

21:38.312 --> 21:39.761
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

21:39.763 --> 21:43.599
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around the timing of all this.

21:43.601 --> 21:45.934
Well, when you wanna
be straight with me,

21:45.936 --> 21:48.103
we can talk about what's best for James.

21:48.105 --> 21:50.155
Okay?

22:02.336 --> 22:05.120
- Hey.
- Okay, these

22:05.122 --> 22:07.172
or these?

22:10.261 --> 22:11.627
Which ones do you want me to say?

22:11.629 --> 22:14.546
I don't know. I want
you to tell me the truth.

22:14.548 --> 22:15.931
First ones.

22:15.933 --> 22:18.267
Or the second ones.

22:18.269 --> 22:19.635
Yeah.

22:19.637 --> 22:22.888
My gosh, you are gonna love
my cousins Rochelle and Joelis,

22:22.890 --> 22:24.356
my mom's sister's kids.

22:24.358 --> 22:26.692
They are hilarious.

22:26.694 --> 22:30.362
What? What is it?

22:30.364 --> 22:31.980
Nothing. Sorry.

22:31.982 --> 22:33.565
Dry cleaners was a nightmare is all.

22:33.567 --> 22:35.150
Well, you'll forget about that

22:35.152 --> 22:36.318
the minute you meet these idiots.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.122
- Here, zip me up, baby.
- Yep.

22:40.124 --> 22:42.708
- Oop, there you go.
- Ooh, baby.

22:42.710 --> 22:44.209
Okay, now I want you
to get in the shower,

22:44.211 --> 22:45.577
and make sure that you lift the window

22:45.579 --> 22:49.164
so that the steam
doesn't fog up the mirror.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.083
Yep.

23:01.095 --> 23:02.761
Antonio!

23:02.763 --> 23:05.063
- Hey, sis.
- Hi.

23:05.065 --> 23:06.565
Guys, wow.

23:06.567 --> 23:09.101
- Smashing.
- Working it.

23:09.103 --> 23:10.819
Nice.

23:10.821 --> 23:13.021
Hey, did you talk to Mom tonight?

23:13.023 --> 23:14.189
- No.
- Why?

23:14.191 --> 23:15.607
Because she called, I called back,

23:15.609 --> 23:16.858
she didn't answer. Seemed upset.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.911
She's always like that in
the run up to this thing.

23:18.913 --> 23:20.829
At the 30 year, I came
early to drop off flowers

23:20.831 --> 23:21.997
and she was...

23:21.999 --> 23:24.533
She was vacuuming the floor herself.

23:26.370 --> 23:28.503
- Take your seat everyone!
- Hey, let's go sit down.

23:28.505 --> 23:30.372
- Take your seat.
- Okay.

23:35.512 --> 23:38.380
All right, settle in.

23:40.301 --> 23:42.184
Okay.

23:42.186 --> 23:44.886
Now, what we have here tonight

23:44.888 --> 23:47.773
is 40 years

23:47.775 --> 23:50.726
with the love of my life,

23:50.728 --> 23:52.194
and we're so grateful

23:52.196 --> 23:54.896
that you are here to celebrate with us.

23:54.898 --> 23:57.032
My wife, Camila,

23:57.034 --> 23:59.201
as many of you know

23:59.203 --> 24:02.454
has been my rock,

24:02.456 --> 24:04.823
my salvation,

24:04.825 --> 24:07.409
my...

24:10.914 --> 24:13.081
I can't do this.

24:17.254 --> 24:18.503
I'm sorry.

24:18.505 --> 24:20.922
We were gonna hold off, you know,

24:20.924 --> 24:23.091
so that you all could
enjoy yourselves tonight.

24:23.093 --> 24:26.428
- Ramon.
- No, no, it has to be said.

24:26.430 --> 24:29.314
Camila and I...

24:29.316 --> 24:31.516
Are getting divorced.

24:36.774 --> 24:38.774
And I want you all to know

24:38.776 --> 24:41.276
that this was a mutual decision.

24:41.278 --> 24:43.278
- It was not!
- More or less.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.080
What the hell is this?

24:45.082 --> 24:47.416
Just, take it easy, Antonio.

24:47.418 --> 24:48.750
Easy?

24:48.752 --> 24:50.786
You're embarrassing
yourself. Embarrassing mom.

24:50.788 --> 24:53.455
Por favor, you can spare me

24:53.457 --> 24:55.791
and everyone here the lecture.

24:55.793 --> 24:57.959
Party's over. Everybody get out,

24:57.961 --> 24:59.628
so I could talk some
sense into my father,

24:59.630 --> 25:01.630
who seems to have lost his mind!

25:01.632 --> 25:03.799
Look at Ma! Apologize right now!

25:03.801 --> 25:06.802
I apologize for nothing!

25:08.939 --> 25:10.105
Come on.

25:12.443 --> 25:14.309
Antonio!

25:14.311 --> 25:16.111
Stop! Hey, come on!

25:16.113 --> 25:17.979
Antonio!

25:17.981 --> 25:19.865
Come on, come on, come on. Stop.

25:19.867 --> 25:21.983
- All right, all right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:27.241 --> 25:29.241
Hey.

25:29.243 --> 25:31.159
Ga... Gabby.

25:41.672 --> 25:44.506
Antonio and Brett got your
mom upstairs to her room,

25:44.508 --> 25:46.925
your dad's at the bar, plastered,

25:46.927 --> 25:49.227
and everyone else has left.

25:49.229 --> 25:51.430
Except one of your cousins,

25:51.432 --> 25:53.482
who I'm pretty sure
is making a doggie bag

25:53.484 --> 25:54.766
out of the charcuterie.

25:56.353 --> 25:58.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:00.157 --> 26:03.275
Talk about being blindsided.

26:03.277 --> 26:05.610
They handled it terribly.

26:05.612 --> 26:08.864
I'm their daughter. You know?

26:08.866 --> 26:11.032
You'd think my mom
would pick up the phone.

26:11.034 --> 26:12.868
She knew you had your own
thing going on with Louie.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.369
- I'm sure it was...
- That's no excuse, Matt.

26:14.371 --> 26:16.755
- I know.
- I... I'm not speaking for them.

26:16.757 --> 26:19.007
I...

26:22.513 --> 26:23.929
listen.

26:23.931 --> 26:25.881
I love you.

26:25.883 --> 26:28.850
Whatever you need from me, I'm here.

26:30.521 --> 26:32.220
All right?

26:48.723 --> 26:51.025
Hey!

26:51.027 --> 26:52.560
Who won?

26:52.562 --> 26:56.447
- He did.
- I think he's part mole.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.899
A W is a W, baby!

26:58.901 --> 27:02.153
- Whoo!
- Yeah, it is!

27:02.155 --> 27:03.404
- Aw, look I'm sorry.
- Why?

27:03.406 --> 27:05.906
Hey, hey, hey, whoa! Hey!

27:05.908 --> 27:08.993
Hey, hey, no, don't
touch anything in here.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.878
I just got this place steam cleaned

27:10.880 --> 27:13.080
to the tune of 500 simolies.

27:13.082 --> 27:15.499
Stay away. Go.

27:16.419 --> 27:18.252
Well, um...

27:18.254 --> 27:20.337
You're really not gonna like this.

27:26.929 --> 27:28.679
Come on in, guys!

27:28.681 --> 27:30.314
Hey, hey!

27:34.353 --> 27:37.655
First rounds on me, mud-runners!

27:38.858 --> 27:41.192
No...

27:41.194 --> 27:44.111
Mud run, mud run!

27:44.113 --> 27:47.698
Mud run!

27:47.700 --> 27:50.117
I believe you owe me two.

27:50.119 --> 27:52.870
Thanks for volunteering us.

27:56.042 --> 27:59.009
Have a seat, Rorschach.

28:01.714 --> 28:02.880
No.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.132
What're you doing?

28:08.971 --> 28:11.355
Hey.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.307
Hey.

28:13.309 --> 28:16.860
Look, I wanted you to
know that Donna and I,

28:16.862 --> 28:18.729
we have talked...

28:18.731 --> 28:20.864
And...

28:20.866 --> 28:23.033
We would be very happy
if you stayed with us

28:23.035 --> 28:25.953
for the rest of the school year.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.538
That's... that's great. Yeah.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.456
Um, what about Mom?

28:29.458 --> 28:31.742
She'll come around.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.494
But this house, it has rules,

28:33.496 --> 28:36.664
and one of those rules is,

28:36.666 --> 28:38.582
we speak honestly with each other.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.668
Yeah, I understand.

28:40.670 --> 28:42.169
Good.

28:42.171 --> 28:44.255
So...

28:45.508 --> 28:49.893
What's going on with the bruises, James?

28:49.895 --> 28:52.813
- The bru... the bruises?
- Yeah.

28:56.018 --> 28:57.518
Look, James.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.103
If someone's giving you
a hard time at school,

28:59.105 --> 29:00.604
I wanna know about it.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.690
We wanna know about it.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.076
It... it's...

29:06.078 --> 29:08.162
Come on, James.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.581
No secrets.

29:15.037 --> 29:16.537
Fine.

29:16.539 --> 29:18.839
There's a stairwell
they forgot to salt.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.841
Runs at the back of the school.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.126
I bit it hard

29:22.128 --> 29:23.877
and I fell

29:23.879 --> 29:26.213
halfway down the stairs
in front of everybody.

29:28.267 --> 29:32.019
It was... it was so embarrassing.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.402
Okay then.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.258
I...

30:12.845 --> 30:16.597
I didn't fall down the stairs.

30:21.937 --> 30:24.438
Someone hit me.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.990
More than once.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.910
Wh...

30:29.912 --> 30:32.112
Someone from school?

30:33.282 --> 30:35.783
No.

30:35.785 --> 30:37.868
Not at school.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.272
Hey.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.896
- No!
- No!

31:05.898 --> 31:07.564
No!

31:07.566 --> 31:09.733
No, no!

31:09.735 --> 31:11.402
No!

31:14.824 --> 31:16.657
You're suspended, Wallace.

31:16.659 --> 31:19.576
Conduct unbecoming of a firefighter.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.329
He was beating on my stepson, Steve.

31:22.331 --> 31:24.331
17-year-old boy.
Couldn't defend himself.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.167
I understand, and so
does the department.

31:27.169 --> 31:29.920
Which is why you're only
suspended for one shift.

31:42.518 --> 31:44.435
Wallace...

31:46.689 --> 31:48.772
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.084
Okay, listen up.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.504
I'm filling in for Chief Boden today.

32:03.506 --> 32:04.671
He's been suspended...

32:04.673 --> 32:07.207
- What?
- Aw, come on!

32:07.209 --> 32:09.510
For one shift.

32:09.512 --> 32:12.212
And we got a job to do
and we're gonna do it.

32:12.214 --> 32:14.598
Okay?

32:14.600 --> 32:17.518
That's it. Dismissed.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.393
Hey.

32:26.395 --> 32:28.445
How's she doing?

32:29.532 --> 32:31.815
In a fog.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.867
I think Antonio's trying to
get back into fighting weight

32:33.869 --> 32:35.786
so he can kick his old
man's ass in the ring.

32:35.788 --> 32:38.155
No, I'm not exaggerating.

32:38.157 --> 32:41.875
That's actually what
he said he was gonna do.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.210
You hear from the chief?

32:43.212 --> 32:44.745
Left him a text message.

32:44.747 --> 32:46.797
Told him we're throwing
him a suspension party.

32:46.799 --> 32:48.165
No excuses.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.666
He hasn't responded.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.752
Hey.

32:51.754 --> 32:53.003
- Hey.
- I wanted you to know,

32:53.005 --> 32:54.755
um, you were right.

32:54.757 --> 32:58.759
I-I had a really nice time last night.

33:07.436 --> 33:09.069
I'm sorry you had to see that.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.989
It's fine.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.324
You should come to a Brett
family reunion in Fowlerton

33:14.326 --> 33:16.743
if you wanna see a real horror show.

33:21.116 --> 33:25.452
It's just that my parents...

33:25.454 --> 33:28.705
So what am I supposed to do...

33:28.707 --> 33:30.507
Truck 81, Ambulance 61,

33:30.509 --> 33:32.042
man down from unknown causes,

33:32.044 --> 33:34.628
907 S. Laramie.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.139
- What do we got?
- We're filling up the truck.

33:46.141 --> 33:47.975
George lost his footing and fell in.

33:47.977 --> 33:50.477
We tried pulling him out, but
that stuff is like quicksand.

33:50.479 --> 33:51.979
You guys try emptying the chute?

33:51.981 --> 33:53.780
Yeah, it just kept sucking him down.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.816
All right, let's take a look.

33:59.038 --> 34:02.456
Hey, George, right?

34:04.543 --> 34:06.994
Hey!

34:08.998 --> 34:10.496
George, hold on.

34:13.002 --> 34:15.217
God.

34:17.672 --> 34:19.056
I can't. I...

34:19.058 --> 34:20.507
I-I can... I can't.

34:20.509 --> 34:21.725
Hold on.

34:25.341 --> 34:27.574
Hold on.

34:27.577 --> 34:29.828
I can't. I can't.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.663
I can... I can't.

34:31.665 --> 34:34.215
I ca... I ca...

34:34.217 --> 34:36.717
I can't.

34:36.719 --> 34:39.087
Got you.

34:39.089 --> 34:41.005
You're not dying on me.

34:54.855 --> 34:57.856
George? Stay with me, buddy.

34:57.858 --> 35:00.942
I can't.

35:02.279 --> 35:04.112
Can't breathe.

35:04.114 --> 35:06.998
We gotta clear this grain faster.

35:08.618 --> 35:10.702
George...

35:12.456 --> 35:14.839
Stay with me, George.

35:14.841 --> 35:16.624
Herrmann, faster.

35:16.626 --> 35:18.376
Got it.

35:27.971 --> 35:29.721
Okay, get him out.

35:32.059 --> 35:34.059
On my count.

35:34.061 --> 35:36.061
One, two, three.

35:37.731 --> 35:40.231
Yeah, come on.

36:11.151 --> 36:14.102
Suffocation victim. BP's
normal, heart rate's normal.

36:14.104 --> 36:15.353
Crepitus on his chest.

36:15.355 --> 36:17.021
We got him. Four is open?

36:18.325 --> 36:20.358
Um, I'm gonna get us some extra sheets.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.743
Yeah, I'm gonna finish the report.

36:25.912 --> 36:28.863
Hey, how's Matt doing?

36:28.865 --> 36:30.782
- He's fine.
- Why?

36:30.784 --> 36:35.119
Seems like he took that
little boy's death hard.

36:35.121 --> 36:36.421
Sorry, what are we talking about?

36:36.423 --> 36:39.457
The little boy, from
the warehouse accident.

36:39.459 --> 36:41.793
He didn't make it.

36:41.795 --> 36:43.795
Matt came by and brought
some "get well" flowers,

36:43.797 --> 36:48.299
but the kid was gone.

36:48.301 --> 36:50.218
I figured he told you.

36:50.220 --> 36:54.138
N... no. He didn't.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.139
When was this?

36:55.141 --> 36:57.191
Saturday morning.

37:07.737 --> 37:11.155
May I come in?

37:11.157 --> 37:13.908
Yeah.

37:13.910 --> 37:18.913
I swear I didn't know what he was doing.

37:18.915 --> 37:24.085
What Todd was doing...
He hid it from me.

37:24.087 --> 37:28.473
Maybe I was too blind to see it.

37:28.475 --> 37:32.894
Frankly, I don't know which is worse.

37:32.896 --> 37:34.679
I left him.

37:34.681 --> 37:38.349
As soon as he came clean,
I-I left out the door.

37:38.351 --> 37:43.237
- And I am never looking back.
- Good.

37:43.239 --> 37:46.741
Mom...

37:46.743 --> 37:49.360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:49.362 --> 37:52.029
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

37:52.031 --> 37:56.918
I'm sorry.

37:56.920 --> 38:01.088
- I'm okay.
- James...

38:01.090 --> 38:04.459
You gonna stay with Grandma?

38:04.461 --> 38:09.046
Maybe I'll stay with
Mom, make sure she's okay.

38:09.048 --> 38:11.766
- Yeah.
- Of course.

38:18.441 --> 38:21.526
- I want a re-match.
- No way.

38:21.528 --> 38:24.362
No way any more muddy morons
are coming into my bar.

38:24.364 --> 38:25.446
I just got it cleaned up.

38:25.448 --> 38:27.482
What... we made
money and you know it.

38:27.484 --> 38:30.568
We didn't even break even.
Go look at the cleaning bill.

38:30.570 --> 38:32.620
I've been drinking free for a week.

38:32.622 --> 38:35.072
- Yeah, you have.
- Right, see what I mean?

38:35.074 --> 38:36.908
This place has been more
cold than hot lately.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.493
I'm afraid to even pull out the books.

38:38.495 --> 38:40.411
You were the one that
bet against me, right?

38:40.413 --> 38:42.296
My mistake.

38:42.298 --> 38:44.966
Hey, are you guys doing
the polar plunge this year?

38:44.968 --> 38:48.669
I just saw a flier and it
says it's for charity, so...

38:48.671 --> 38:49.754
I'm part penguin.

38:49.756 --> 38:51.506
I'm all polar bear.

38:51.508 --> 38:54.141
Really?

38:54.143 --> 38:57.094
You know, what mi padre said? Ask me.

38:57.096 --> 38:59.013
What'd your padre say?

38:59.015 --> 39:01.349
"Should've done it 30 years ago."

39:01.351 --> 39:02.733
I did the math.

39:02.735 --> 39:04.101
There's no way I'm
telling Gabby that one.

39:04.103 --> 39:05.736
Good choice.

39:05.738 --> 39:09.407
I don't even... my old man's
on wife number... I lost track.

39:09.409 --> 39:14.445
Forty years... That's a good run.

39:14.447 --> 39:15.997
You ever gonna settle down, Kelly?

39:15.999 --> 39:19.617
Married to the job.

39:23.423 --> 39:25.456
Excuse me.

39:27.594 --> 39:28.793
Chief.

39:28.795 --> 39:31.212
- Hey.
- How you doing?

39:31.214 --> 39:32.847
Working my way back to normal.

39:32.849 --> 39:35.466
- James?
- Typical.

39:35.468 --> 39:38.185
More worried about his mom than himself.

39:38.187 --> 39:40.855
Yeah. He's a good kid.

39:40.857 --> 39:42.690
Hey, if he ever wants
to ride along with us,

39:42.692 --> 39:44.809
he's more than welcome on Squad 3.

39:44.811 --> 39:45.977
I'll tell him.

39:45.979 --> 39:48.396
But right now, I need to drink.

39:48.398 --> 39:49.480
Come on.

39:49.482 --> 39:51.282
Chief drinks on me tonight.

39:51.284 --> 39:52.617
Got it covered. All right.

39:52.619 --> 39:55.319
- Everybody, put it in the boot.
- Put it in the boot.

39:55.321 --> 39:56.787
- I already donated.
- Boot.

39:56.789 --> 39:57.872
No, you didn't!

39:57.874 --> 39:58.873
Just because you don't believe me...

39:58.875 --> 40:01.459
There you go.

40:07.884 --> 40:11.552
- Hey, tried calling.
- You okay?

40:23.149 --> 40:26.150
You knew that boy died.

40:26.152 --> 40:27.685
And you were more
worried about making sure

40:27.687 --> 40:30.187
that I had a good day.

40:37.864 --> 40:42.199
That's what we do. Lift each other up.

40:42.201 --> 40:44.368
You've done that for me a million times.
