<i>Look what the Navy did to us.</i>

00:34.833 --> 00:36.441
Turn it off.

00:36.466 --> 00:38.900
[Radio turns off]

00:43.440 --> 00:44.974
What's the status on sonar?

00:44.999 --> 00:47.266
Sir, the torpedo blast
ruptured several pipes

00:47.291 --> 00:48.590
in sonar's cooling skid.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.227
It's fixable, I think, but not quickly.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.918
Heading into open sea with no ears

00:52.943 --> 00:55.262
and no idea where that sub
is prowling... that's suicide.

00:55.286 --> 00:56.719
And now New Orleans is burning,

00:56.744 --> 00:58.243
and we can't do a damn thing about it.

00:58.268 --> 00:59.441
Pardon me, Mr. president.

00:59.466 --> 01:02.394
Sir, recommend using our
helo to drop passive sonobuoys

01:02.419 --> 01:04.385
at both entry points to the canal.

01:05.569 --> 01:07.316
Remote sonar, sir.

01:07.341 --> 01:10.261
Acts as an early-warning system
until we get sonar back up.

01:10.286 --> 01:11.760
That'll buy us some time.

01:11.785 --> 01:14.785
First hit on the buoys, we
go to quiet 2, hunt that sub.

01:14.810 --> 01:16.863
ASTAC, T.A.O... Load passive buoys.

01:16.888 --> 01:20.222
Till then, we repair the sonar.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.870
Let the land team do what it can do

01:21.895 --> 01:23.402
to help the people of New Orleans.

01:23.427 --> 01:24.534
- Aye, sir.
- Understood.

01:24.559 --> 01:27.927
I want those buoys on board.
Get that bird in the air.

01:28.235 --> 01:30.002
Cobra Team, give me a SITREP.

working through the night,

01:32.767 --> 01:33.808

01:33.833 --> 01:35.948
We got at least a couple dozen
wounded here on the beach.

01:35.973 --> 01:37.504
We're doing what we can, sir.

01:37.529 --> 01:39.636
Any sign of Ramsey or his people?

01:39.661 --> 01:40.652
Negative, sir.

01:40.677 --> 01:41.909
These people are not immune,

01:41.934 --> 01:43.160
and they don't know what hit them.

01:43.185 --> 01:44.308
- Stay away!
- Hang on.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.341
No! Don't get me sick!

01:45.366 --> 01:46.433
We're not sick, okay?

01:46.458 --> 01:48.160
Look, you're hurt. Let me help you.

01:54.263 --> 01:56.851
Washed up in the debris
were parts of a limpet mine.

01:56.876 --> 01:58.937
Looks like it was attached
to the hull of a sailboat.

01:58.962 --> 02:00.039
Help is on the way.

02:00.064 --> 02:02.110
So Ramsey's people set bombs
all over the flotilla...

02:02.135 --> 02:05.339
Just waited for us to
show up, set them off.

02:05.364 --> 02:07.211
Continue search and rescue and report.

02:07.268 --> 02:09.168

<i>By now, many of you will have seen</i>

02:40.221 --> 02:45.116

<i>The U.S. Navy ship that

<i>but it doesn't represent

02:56.832 --> 03:02.062
<i>That ship is a key part

03:02.087 --> 03:03.918

03:11.353 --> 03:13.320
<i>I know it's heartbreaking and... </i>

03:13.345 --> 03:15.282
"New world order"...
That's a good one, Bruv.

03:15.307 --> 03:17.536
- <i>Difficult to believe.</i>
- I thought so.

03:17.561 --> 03:19.582

have more evidence</i>

03:19.584 --> 03:24.587

03:45.729 --> 03:47.729
but somehow boosted to go long-range.

03:47.754 --> 03:49.400
You don't need the

03:49.425 --> 03:52.392
No... like the video of

I could've gone to doc Rios, but...

04:58.415 --> 05:00.448
I don't know.

05:00.473 --> 05:01.593
Something weird about

05:01.618 --> 05:04.905

How ready are you to get
your new version of the cure

06:05.316 --> 06:06.682
out into the world?

06:06.972 --> 06:09.339
As I mentioned before,

06:09.412 --> 06:13.356
as soon as we safely land
in a highly populated area,

06:13.381 --> 06:15.776
anyone carrying the new, contagious version

06:15.801 --> 06:20.675
will be able to spread the
cure via close contact...

06:20.700 --> 06:24.405
A handshake... Or a hug.

06:24.678 --> 06:28.031
If each of us carries the
cure to even two people,

06:28.056 --> 06:30.830
who then pass it on to two more people,

06:30.855 --> 06:32.721
we'll start a chain reaction

06:32.746 --> 06:34.761
that even Ramsey won't be able to stop.

06:34.786 --> 06:37.954
You said you injected yourself
with the contagious cure.

06:37.979 --> 06:40.492
Does that mean you've already
spread it around the ship?

06:40.517 --> 06:42.092
Unfortunately not.

06:42.511 --> 06:45.820
People who were previously
inoculated will need boosters.

06:45.845 --> 06:47.378
We should start the process, then.

06:47.403 --> 06:50.604
The contagious period is
only five to eight days,

06:50.629 --> 06:53.920

06:54.846 --> 06:56.879
With all due respect...

06:57.115 --> 06:59.248

06:59.273 --> 07:02.308

certain we'll be on land.

07:04.629 --> 07:06.054

07:23.090 --> 07:25.712
[Sighing] Oh, God.

07:28.912 --> 07:31.700
Looks like the Ramseys got
more off our secure servers

07:31.725 --> 07:33.658
than just the location of our labs.

07:33.683 --> 07:35.160
He's dumping all the details

07:35.185 --> 07:37.223
of the government's
response to the outbreak,

07:37.248 --> 07:40.849
carefully redacted to make
it look like a conspiracy.

07:40.874 --> 07:42.441
This one caught my eye.

07:43.749 --> 07:45.516
"Project bluenose"?

07:45.541 --> 07:48.035
Mm. Bluenose... The Navy calls a sailor

07:48.060 --> 07:49.482
who's crossed the arctic circle.

07:49.507 --> 07:51.340
So that was the code name for our mission

07:51.365 --> 07:53.196
to get the primordial virus off the ice.

07:53.221 --> 07:54.102
Mm-hmm.

07:54.127 --> 07:55.626
Though this is the first I'm hearing of it.

07:55.651 --> 07:57.532
Bluenose was secret even to <i>us.</i>

07:57.557 --> 07:59.368
Except, the way Ramsey tells it,

07:59.393 --> 08:01.610
our mission wasn't to
<i>find</i> the cure...

08:01.823 --> 08:03.860
It was to weaponize it.

08:03.885 --> 08:05.790
That's the problem with
top-secret missions...

08:05.815 --> 08:07.267
They invite conspiracy theories.

08:07.292 --> 08:09.786
He's counting on that,
sir... Mixing truth and lies

08:09.811 --> 08:11.277
and spreading it over his network

08:11.302 --> 08:13.335
to turn the American people against us.

08:14.380 --> 08:15.747
And he's got help.

08:15.772 --> 08:17.505
That's the same logo
that appeared in the video

08:17.530 --> 08:18.929

08:19.089 --> 08:21.907
Whoever's running Valkyrie
knows what they're doing.

08:21.932 --> 08:24.548
They've gone beyond simple text
messages from phone to phone.

08:24.573 --> 08:25.739
This is a vast network.

08:25.764 --> 08:27.490
The sub's running low on weaponry,

08:27.515 --> 08:29.001
and they've missed us twice.

08:29.153 --> 08:31.064
Now counting on civilians for help.

08:31.089 --> 08:33.462
So we get into the network,
and we shut it down.

08:33.488 --> 08:35.087
No, commander.

08:35.113 --> 08:38.614
We take over the network, use
it to get <i>our</i> message out.

08:38.947 --> 08:40.547
Ramsey's already told everyone

08:40.572 --> 08:42.289

08:42.315 --> 08:43.384
Get me on that network,

08:43.409 --> 08:45.306

to the American people.

Once they hear the truth
about me, about you,

08:48.206 --> 08:51.807
and about Sean Ramsey, we'll
turn America against him,

08:51.832 --> 08:54.009

10:17.593 --> 10:19.026
relayed to us from the helo through ASTAC.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.183
So far, quiet.

10:20.218 --> 10:22.233
- Surface.
- No contacts.

10:22.758 --> 10:25.139
Cobra Team, Viper, move
to next coordinates.

10:25.164 --> 10:26.350
Man: Cobra Team, roger.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.154
Boys on land are helping us triangulate

10:28.179 --> 10:30.212
the source of the Valkyrie signal.

10:30.237 --> 10:31.904
I have an approximate
location of the source...

10:31.929 --> 10:36.928
28 degrees, 33 minutes North
by 89 degrees, 22 minutes west.

10:36.953 --> 10:39.220
No landmass, but it
could be an anchored ship.

10:39.245 --> 10:40.714
We're gonna need a visual.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.572
Helo's tied up with the sonobuoys.

10:42.574 --> 10:45.248
Send the U.A.V. Nice
and high. Sweep the area.

10:45.273 --> 10:47.973
Prep VBSS to board and take
over whatever's out there.

10:47.998 --> 10:49.717
And get Cobra Team back to the ship.

10:49.742 --> 10:50.530
Aye, sir.

10:50.555 --> 10:52.526
Tower, T.A.O. Ready U.A.V.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.248
Man: T.A.O. tower,
roger. U.A.V. on standby.

10:55.273 --> 10:58.174
Cobra Team, Viper, render
aid and then return to Mother.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.381
Roger that, Mother.

10:59.635 --> 11:01.268
Just a few more wounded to look at,

11:01.293 --> 11:02.246
then we're off the beach.

11:02.271 --> 11:04.047
Bravo Zulu.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.742
All right, you'll be all
right. Go take a seat.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.266
Okay.

11:10.291 --> 11:13.021
Woman: All right.

11:19.050 --> 11:21.685
Gator: U.A.V. approaching point of origin.

11:23.786 --> 11:26.121
- Sonar?
- Still no sign of the sub.

11:26.146 --> 11:29.735
U.A.V. is eight klicks
from source of broadcast.

11:34.897 --> 11:37.836
Kara: Zoom in on that.

11:46.056 --> 11:47.496
Bridge, T.A.O.

11:47.521 --> 11:49.314
We've got an oil rig at the coordinates.

11:49.339 --> 11:52.322
I say again... an oil rig is the
source of the broadcast signal.

11:52.347 --> 11:56.515
My fellow Americans, my
name is Jeffrey Michener,

11:56.630 --> 11:59.665
and I am the president
of the United States.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.223
It's not a position I asked for,

12:02.248 --> 12:04.681
nor was I elected to this office.

12:04.823 --> 12:07.622
The circumstances of this dreadful plague

12:07.647 --> 12:11.523
have placed me here with
an awesome responsibility...

12:11.548 --> 12:13.830
To help unite all survivors

12:13.855 --> 12:16.689
and to help restore our great nation

12:16.714 --> 12:18.281
to its former glory.

12:18.306 --> 12:21.407
I speak to you aboard the
USS <i>Nathan James,</i>

12:21.432 --> 12:24.466
a Navy ship carrying some 200 Americans

12:24.491 --> 12:27.487
just like you... Brave men and women

12:27.512 --> 12:30.322
who have lost their
families, their friends.

12:30.347 --> 12:34.033
Led by Commander Tom Chandler,
these brave volunteers

12:34.058 --> 12:36.853
left Norfolk, Virginia, six months ago

12:36.878 --> 12:38.440
to search for the cure.

12:38.465 --> 12:40.240
They found it.

12:40.998 --> 12:42.232
Some of you may have heard

12:42.257 --> 12:44.938
that the U.S. government and the military

12:44.963 --> 12:47.619
are behind the spread of this deadly virus,

12:47.644 --> 12:50.579
that the Navy ship is here
to spread more disease,

12:50.604 --> 12:52.744
and that I am a prisoner on this ship.

12:52.769 --> 12:55.064
Nothing could be further from the truth.

12:55.584 --> 12:59.972
In fact, I <i>was</i> a
prisoner... Of Sean Ramsey,

12:59.997 --> 13:02.373
the man who now claims to be your savior.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.972
He has filled the airwaves
with lies about me,

13:05.997 --> 13:09.197
about the ship, and about your country.

13:09.454 --> 13:14.073
I ask you during this
time of crisis and chaos

13:14.098 --> 13:16.773
to remember who we are as a people.

13:16.972 --> 13:19.172
This plague has killed many,

13:19.373 --> 13:22.773
but let's not let it divide us any longer.

13:22.798 --> 13:25.773
We are still one nation. Join us.

13:26.041 --> 13:29.073
Push Sean Ramsey back to the sea,

13:29.098 --> 13:32.447
and let's restore this
great nation together.

13:32.472 --> 13:36.741
God bless you, and God bless America.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.790
Speech of a lifetime, Mr. President.

13:41.945 --> 13:44.478
Let's hope it gets where it needs to go.

13:48.390 --> 13:51.424
Sir, I will get it there or die trying.

13:51.449 --> 13:54.124
â™ª

14:11.101 --> 14:13.135
Garnett: Sir, Vulture
Team has hit open water.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.276
When they reach the oil rig,
Walker will secure the RHIB.

14:16.301 --> 14:19.112
Once aboard the oil platform,
the snipes will secure the cap

14:19.137 --> 14:20.809
and ensure the soundness of the facility.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.433
The last thing the
people of New Orleans need

14:22.458 --> 14:24.346
is the Navy causing a massive oil spill.

14:24.371 --> 14:25.444
Agreed.

14:25.469 --> 14:26.849
We lost visual on the rig?

14:26.874 --> 14:27.722
Yes, sir.

14:27.747 --> 14:29.910
The U.A.V. is en route
back to ship to refuel.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.370
- And our radios?
- HF should work.

14:32.403 --> 14:34.403
We'll be able to hear everything
that happens on the oil rig.

14:34.428 --> 14:37.105
Based the signal strength
Cobra Team read on the beach,

14:37.130 --> 14:39.089
the oil rig's got a massive antenna.

14:39.114 --> 14:41.019
So when Lieutenant
Granderson takes control,

14:41.044 --> 14:44.307
we'll be able to broadcast
1,000 miles in every direction.

14:44.731 --> 14:46.098
All right, listen up.

14:46.123 --> 14:49.408
As per the drill,<i>Nathan
James</i> <i>does not broadcast,</i>

14:49.433 --> 14:50.966
and we need to be prepared.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.025
As soon as the president's
speech goes wide,

14:53.050 --> 14:54.597
that rig and everyone on it

14:54.622 --> 14:57.885
becomes painted with a big, fat target.

15:51.039 --> 15:53.307
Burk, stairs.

15:54.431 --> 15:58.233
Senior Chief Lynn, as
soon as the cap's secure,

15:58.813 --> 16:01.114
close off all the pipe valves and join us.

16:01.139 --> 16:02.205
Aye, aye, sir.

16:02.230 --> 16:03.524
Lieutenant Chung.

16:03.549 --> 16:04.454
Chung: Sir?

16:04.479 --> 16:06.243
Let's find out what makes this thing tick.

16:06.268 --> 16:08.101
Aye, sir.

16:13.552 --> 16:17.254
Here it is... Main power.

16:23.910 --> 16:25.908
[Door creaks]

16:32.438 --> 16:35.307
This looks like the
communications center, sir.

16:40.951 --> 16:43.009
I'd say so.

16:44.995 --> 16:46.935
Let's get you started.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.660
Aye, sir.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.148
Really?

16:57.173 --> 16:58.356
What?

16:58.381 --> 16:59.890
Green shoelaces?

16:59.915 --> 17:00.814
What?

17:00.839 --> 17:01.726
Nothing.

17:01.751 --> 17:03.249
[Sighs] My other ones ripped.

17:03.274 --> 17:04.530
It's not like there's a Navy exchange store

17:04.555 --> 17:05.476
around the corner.

17:05.501 --> 17:06.700
You don't like them?

17:06.724 --> 17:08.911
[Sighs] Just keep
climbing. We'll talk later.

17:08.935 --> 17:11.413
[Sighs] Get out of my head, Bivas.

17:11.438 --> 17:14.280
No use, mate. She's got you now.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.980
[Sighing] Yeah, I know.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.270
Sir, so far, all I see
is regular telecom gear.

17:34.295 --> 17:36.228
Nothing to run Bluetooth.

17:36.253 --> 17:37.719
You see that antenna.

17:37.744 --> 17:40.078
That signal <i>is</i> coming from here.

17:40.103 --> 17:41.936
Keep looking.

17:42.673 --> 17:44.780
Rig's operating on diesel power, sir.

17:44.805 --> 17:46.432
Looks like it's been idling continuously.

17:46.457 --> 17:48.157
Got enough fuel to last awhile.

17:48.182 --> 17:49.215
How long?

17:49.240 --> 17:50.172
At least a few months, sir.

17:50.197 --> 17:51.196
[Thud]

17:51.221 --> 17:53.221
Hey!

17:54.058 --> 17:55.774
Whoa. Take it easy.

17:55.799 --> 17:56.939
- [Gun cocks]
- Whoa!

17:56.964 --> 17:58.096
Take it easy.

17:58.121 --> 18:00.236
[Breathing heavily]

18:00.260 --> 18:02.034
You're outnumbered.

18:04.756 --> 18:07.688
Don't be stupid.

18:10.477 --> 18:12.009
You can't hold me.

18:12.355 --> 18:15.534
My people will come for me.

18:19.283 --> 18:21.111
Valkyrie.

18:23.198 --> 18:24.834
Congratulations.

18:25.048 --> 18:26.914
You found me.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.627
â™ª

18:37.122 --> 18:39.756
Lynn: All valves sealed on "A" level.

18:39.781 --> 18:41.597
Heading down to 1 to find the main.

18:41.622 --> 18:43.086
Outstanding.

18:43.111 --> 18:45.311
Let's start with your name.

18:45.336 --> 18:46.736
Don't have one.

18:46.761 --> 18:48.486
Valerie Raymond.

18:48.511 --> 18:50.229
Get your hands off my stuff!

18:50.254 --> 18:53.471
Got an I.D. here from the Tulane
University engineering lab.

18:53.497 --> 18:56.703
"Val." "Valkyrie."

18:56.728 --> 18:57.602
Clever.

18:57.627 --> 18:59.703
Sir, I cannot gain access to the antenna.

18:59.728 --> 19:01.803
I'm assuming <i>you</i> can help with that.

19:01.875 --> 19:06.003
After all, you're the genius
behind the "deadman" game.

19:06.028 --> 19:09.563
Got to admit... Not what I expected.

19:09.588 --> 19:11.495
[Scoffs] If I hear one
more "Wizard of Oz" joke...

19:11.520 --> 19:14.185
Is that what Sean Ramsey said
the first time he saw you?

19:14.210 --> 19:15.685
Are you like him?

19:15.710 --> 19:17.109
Immune?

19:17.292 --> 19:19.285
Look where I'm living.

19:19.532 --> 19:22.867
I got myself as far away
from the sickness as possible.

19:22.892 --> 19:24.058
No.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.185
I helped Sean with communications

19:26.210 --> 19:27.995
because we share a common enemy.

19:28.020 --> 19:29.085
And that would be <i>me?</i>

19:29.110 --> 19:30.476
Ramsey showed me everything

19:30.501 --> 19:32.675
about your secret mission
to spread the virus.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.433
And you believed him.

19:34.692 --> 19:36.765
Well, I already knew most of the story.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.925
Before anyone even heard
of the Egyptian flu,

19:38.950 --> 19:40.515
I was tracking it.

19:40.540 --> 19:43.284
I saw it jump to phase 6 overnight,

19:43.309 --> 19:45.742
and I saw the government do nothing.

19:45.902 --> 19:48.072
So I created Valkyrie

19:48.097 --> 19:50.398
to help expose the truth behind the plague.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.922
The truth?

19:53.935 --> 19:55.299
Well, shit.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.299
You got it all figured out.

19:57.324 --> 19:59.624
But you forgot the most important part

19:59.649 --> 20:00.673
of the conspiracy...

20:00.698 --> 20:03.966
The only way we were able
to spread the flu so quickly.

20:04.896 --> 20:06.763
The aliens.

20:07.257 --> 20:09.307
From planet batshit crazy.

20:09.332 --> 20:11.772
They were sneezing all over the place.

20:11.797 --> 20:13.630
That's what you people always do.

20:13.655 --> 20:15.973
When alternative history gains traction,

20:15.998 --> 20:18.373
"just another conspiracy nut."

20:18.398 --> 20:20.473
Right? "Whack job."

20:21.507 --> 20:23.894
I got my masters in computer science

20:23.919 --> 20:25.292
from M.I.T. at 21,

20:25.317 --> 20:29.042
my PHD in engineering
physics from Tulane at 25.

20:29.067 --> 20:32.550
Valkyrie, the network I
created to get out the truth,

20:32.575 --> 20:36.456
has 6 million untraceable
subscribers worldwide.

20:36.481 --> 20:37.480
"Had."

20:37.505 --> 20:38.386
What?

20:38.411 --> 20:39.610
<i>"Had</i> 6 million."

20:39.635 --> 20:42.036
Most of them are probably dead by now.

20:42.256 --> 20:45.174
The rest will die very soon.

20:45.568 --> 20:47.573
We came home with a vaccine

20:47.598 --> 20:49.975
and a cure for those
who were still infected.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.475
It's on our ship.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.975
Ramsey wants to sink us

20:53.000 --> 20:55.374
and let the virus wipe out the rest of you

20:55.399 --> 20:57.475
so his master race can rule the word.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.575
And you think <i>I'm</i> the whack job?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.075
It's the truth.

21:01.588 --> 21:02.722
Look.

21:02.747 --> 21:06.475
You're obviously a
clever and resilient woman

21:06.692 --> 21:10.094
to survive out here as long as you have,

21:10.119 --> 21:12.953
and you've built an impressive network.

21:12.978 --> 21:15.475
You just backed the wrong horse.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.400
Help me play this message.

21:18.781 --> 21:20.815
Listen for yourself.

21:20.840 --> 21:24.308
The truth is in here.

21:25.846 --> 21:27.880
â™ª

21:31.585 --> 21:33.361
Sir, U.A.V. Needs another 30 minutes

21:33.386 --> 21:35.431
before we can send her back
to the rig for a visual.

21:35.456 --> 21:36.931
Okay.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.558
[Clank]

21:39.583 --> 21:41.240
[Grunts] Damn it.

21:41.265 --> 21:42.506
Need a hand, Chief?

21:42.531 --> 21:44.598
Ma'am, there's a secondary
valve over there behind you.

21:44.623 --> 21:46.523
Don't call me "ma'am."

21:46.548 --> 21:48.436
Lieutenant Granderson, how we doing?

21:48.461 --> 21:50.628
There's clearly a component missing...

21:50.653 --> 21:53.125
The device used to control
the Bluetooth booster.

21:53.149 --> 21:56.100
Without it, we can't
access the Valkyrie network.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.691
Lieutenant Chung.

21:58.993 --> 22:00.427
Shut down the rig.

22:00.452 --> 22:03.181
If <i>we</i> can't use
the network, no one will.

22:03.206 --> 22:04.970
Mr. Chung, shut her down!

22:04.995 --> 22:06.294
Yes, sir.

22:06.319 --> 22:09.170
Lieutenant Granderson...

22:09.195 --> 22:10.670
Tear it all out.

22:10.695 --> 22:12.170
Yes, sir.

22:15.563 --> 22:19.232
[Indistinct talking]

22:24.659 --> 22:26.894
[Cellphone beeps]

22:28.014 --> 22:29.615
Man: <i>What the hell is that?</i>

33:52.282 --> 33:54.557
It's hard to tell.

33:57.257 --> 33:59.091
[Breathing shakily]

33:59.116 --> 34:02.757
Milowsky: All right, let's roll
her. Let me check her dressing.

34:05.745 --> 34:08.746
[Breathing heavily]

34:10.306 --> 34:13.022
[Burk grunts]

34:19.087 --> 34:21.431
Stay at her side.

34:29.966 --> 34:32.635
Back slowly down. Let's go.

34:32.659 --> 34:33.824
Here we go.

34:33.850 --> 34:36.792
Easy. Easy. Easy.

34:40.694 --> 34:43.029
I...

34:43.054 --> 34:45.463
I-I... [Breathing heavily]

34:45.487 --> 34:47.263
Can't feel my legs.

34:47.288 --> 34:50.862
That's 'cause they got
them wrapped so tight.

34:52.139 --> 34:54.340
So you won't be jumping around.

34:55.568 --> 34:57.763
You're a terrible liar.

34:58.356 --> 35:01.190
That's why you suck at poker.

35:03.475 --> 35:05.356
Naw, man, you're, uh...

35:06.137 --> 35:08.551
You're all good.

35:08.576 --> 35:11.195
You know, just a couple of scratches.

35:11.220 --> 35:13.895
I told you you're a
mean operator for a girl.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.019
[Chuckles]

35:15.044 --> 35:17.078
I can kick <i>your</i> ass.

35:17.842 --> 35:19.090
No doubt.

35:19.115 --> 35:21.449
[Both chuckle]

35:23.843 --> 35:26.072
Everybody else okay?

35:26.276 --> 35:27.730
Yeah. Yeah.

35:27.755 --> 35:28.877
Yeah?

35:28.902 --> 35:30.229
Everybody's good.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.052
Good.

35:32.077 --> 35:35.353
[Breathing slows]

35:41.590 --> 35:42.749
Ravit.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.374
Ravit, come on, girl.

35:45.399 --> 35:47.172
Breathe.

35:47.197 --> 35:49.897
Everybody okay?

35:49.922 --> 35:51.073
Yeah.

35:51.098 --> 35:53.431
Hey. Everybody's all good.

35:53.456 --> 35:55.273
It's all good.

35:57.819 --> 36:00.227
<i>Schma Yisrael... </i>

36:02.478 --> 36:04.070
<i>Adonai Eloheinu... </i>

36:04.103 --> 36:05.140
Ravit.

36:05.165 --> 36:08.199
<i>Ad-adonai Echad.</i>

36:10.637 --> 36:12.038
Hey.

36:12.695 --> 36:14.895
<i>Baruch... </i>

36:14.920 --> 36:16.994
[Gasping]

36:17.149 --> 36:18.494
Ravit.

36:18.737 --> 36:22.395
[Gasping stops]

36:38.040 --> 36:40.914
[Voice breaking] Ravit.

36:44.204 --> 36:47.437
â™ª

36:55.231 --> 36:56.496
Ow.

36:56.521 --> 36:58.488
Yeah, that's the spot.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.076
[Groans]

37:00.101 --> 37:02.869
Just trying to keep you
from bleeding to death.

37:02.894 --> 37:05.695
[Monitor beeping]

37:05.806 --> 37:09.681
I do still know how to
use my powers for good.

37:10.370 --> 37:12.403
[Sighs]

37:12.428 --> 37:14.161
Ravit?

37:22.023 --> 37:24.358
I lost four sailors.

37:24.383 --> 37:25.982
[Groans]

37:26.234 --> 37:27.767
Four more.

37:27.792 --> 37:30.527
Well, we thought you
might've been the fifth.

37:35.359 --> 37:37.226
It was touch-and-go there for a while.

37:39.273 --> 37:40.940
[Inhales deeply]

37:40.965 --> 37:43.892
Still gonna need to operate and [Sighs]

37:43.917 --> 37:47.313
remove this souvenir I
found behind your liver.

37:47.338 --> 37:48.847
That can wait.

37:49.317 --> 37:50.817
Actually, it can't.

37:50.842 --> 37:53.009
The shrapnel can move and cut you.

37:53.034 --> 37:55.652
I'm not going under... Not now.

37:55.677 --> 37:57.441
Stubborn as ever.

37:57.466 --> 38:00.867
Says the pot to the kettle.

38:06.011 --> 38:07.712
Rachel.

38:11.243 --> 38:13.010
Thank you.

38:16.010 --> 38:19.672
Jeter: We've taken our share
of hits these past few weeks...

38:19.697 --> 38:22.672
Suffered painful losses.

38:23.201 --> 38:26.068
Sometimes, it feels like
more than we can bear.

38:26.093 --> 38:29.573
Yet, here we gather, united.

38:29.598 --> 38:31.864
Shipmates.

38:33.048 --> 38:37.552
Every time we're called,
we answer, "here I am."

38:38.837 --> 38:40.851
We answer knowing that the world,

38:40.892 --> 38:43.337
survival of our species

38:43.362 --> 38:45.338
depends on our actions here at sea

38:45.363 --> 38:49.599
and fullaware that we
answer at our own peril.

38:49.624 --> 38:55.594
And still we answer, "here I am."

38:56.463 --> 39:01.022
I'm not gonna put a silver
lining around our pain.

39:02.527 --> 39:06.000
Today, we grieve and
we remember our fallen,

39:06.025 --> 39:09.722
and we thank them for their
service to us and to mankind.

39:09.803 --> 39:11.736
Yes.

39:12.129 --> 39:17.599
Today we grieve, but
tomorrow, we do press on.

39:18.558 --> 39:24.937
We continue to answer
the call, "here I am."

39:39.580 --> 39:42.882
[Indistinct talking]

39:55.173 --> 39:56.982
[Sighs]

40:01.142 --> 40:05.624
You could've run away
or saved your own people.

40:07.010 --> 40:09.712
[Sniffles] But you ran back for <i>me.</i>

40:13.216 --> 40:16.719
Wasn't all out of the goodness of my heart.

40:18.402 --> 40:20.506
We need you.

40:22.552 --> 40:25.429
I'm a little, um...

40:25.453 --> 40:28.821
I-I thought I knew what was going on.

40:30.972 --> 40:34.141
There's still a lot I don't know.

40:36.557 --> 40:39.382
I wanted you to be here

40:39.917 --> 40:42.917
so you could see who we are.

40:49.186 --> 40:51.383
[Smooches]

41:01.372 --> 41:04.940
Whatever was so important
in that bag of yours...

41:06.380 --> 41:09.115
Can it help us?

41:09.140 --> 41:11.073
