WEBVTT

00:21.731 --> 00:23.733
Kind of Love"]

00:37.663 --> 00:39.540
Pain is cleansing.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.710
Release the pain in the flesh.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.795
<i>She never loved us.</i>

00:45.796 --> 00:47.631
She didn't love me, either.

00:50.426 --> 00:53.637
Let the sacred nectar
prepare the body

00:53.637 --> 00:55.181
to fulfill the prophecy.

01:03.314 --> 01:07.234
To enter the next life
in purity and perfection.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.882
Now let the mind be clear,

01:29.882 --> 01:34.595
releasing all the guilt
and hurt and deceptions

01:34.595 --> 01:36.263
into the old life.

02:21.559 --> 02:23.102
Tide's coming in.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.745
Did you just take
another Vyvanse?

02:41.745 --> 02:43.497
We need to focus
if we're going to figure out

02:43.497 --> 02:45.833
- who Dylan went to kill.
- You're so manic
right now.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.294
Why would he leave a note
if he went to kill someone?

02:48.294 --> 02:50.212
It's not like we can ask him.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.631
As you can see from Exhibit A,

02:52.631 --> 02:54.925
he literally threw his phone
into the ocean.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.802
And no one's answering
at his house.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.888
That's because the phone
only works in the store,

02:58.888 --> 03:01.181
and his moms are away
on a yoga retreat.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.893
Exhibitthis all started
when he got back from MIT,

03:03.893 --> 03:05.895
where he def learned
to clone phones and hack.

03:05.895 --> 03:08.522
Let's not forget,
Ted Bundy was a gifted person.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.857
As are you, clearly.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.444
My mom still talks about
my disappointing math scores.

03:13.444 --> 03:16.947
Exhibiteveryone knows
goats have devil eyes.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.825
So you're saying Dylan's
a math genius psycho

03:19.825 --> 03:21.285
or a devil-worshipping psycho?

03:22.328 --> 03:24.121
It's not funny.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.540
He's the one
who lured us to Clara's,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.626
which is how Riley
ended up dead.

03:28.626 --> 03:30.628
Yeah, which is why
we should be worried about him

03:30.628 --> 03:32.129
instead of being suspicious.

03:32.129 --> 03:35.591
I understand you guys are close
after your cringe sex.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.135
- Just because he was a virgin
doesn't make him innocent.
- Th...

03:38.135 --> 03:39.511
That has nothing
to do with this.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.263
Look, we've all been through
a lot, but we all know

03:41.263 --> 03:42.431
- that Clara's the murderer.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.102
Who is it?

03:47.102 --> 03:50.064
Uh, it's probably
just a telemarketer.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.357
- What...

03:51.357 --> 03:52.608
What if my theory
is sleep-deprived drivel

03:52.608 --> 03:54.401
- and Dylan's in trouble?

03:55.444 --> 03:57.529
- Hello?
<i>- Lennon?</i>

04:03.494 --> 04:05.496
It's not Dylan.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.331
Unless he grew titties.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.918
<i>We should've</i>

04:10.918 --> 04:12.753
- ran Clara out
when we had the chance!
- Yeah!

04:12.753 --> 04:14.964
That spider eater's
been roaming our streets

04:14.964 --> 04:16.882
- for 25 years!
- Hey, hey!

04:16.882 --> 04:19.635
Listen, listen. I know that
everyone is scared, okay?

04:19.635 --> 04:21.845
But we all got to stay calm.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.347
- All right, all right.
Step aside.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.391
- Let her through, come on.
- Thank you. I know.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.685
Thank you, thank you. Listen.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.603
I know that you are
all concerned.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.689
It is very possible that Clara
has a hostage with her.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.984
Local girl
by the name of Riley Thacker.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.528
Who is the sweetest fucking
thing you've ever met.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.614
Anyone sees any sign of them
or anything suspicious,

04:40.614 --> 04:43.200
please call the station
or tell Bruce.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.910
This'll be
our search headquarters.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.537
- He will be our liaison.
- Give me a minute.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.622
I'll have sandwiches and coffee
for everyone.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.583
- Please don't take matters
into your own hands.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.584
Mom.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.008
We got nothing.

04:59.008 --> 05:03.053
Just brain-eating spiders
and unanswered APBs.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.893
Courtney came to me yesterday.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.437
Yeah, she came to me, too.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.315
I told her
Riley was gonna be okay.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.067
Fuck.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.488
You know, when you were
with Clara...

05:21.488 --> 05:24.408
I know it was a long time ago,

05:24.408 --> 05:26.326
but did she have a boat or...

05:26.326 --> 05:27.995
some other way
to get off the island?

05:30.039 --> 05:31.957
Not that I can remember.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.334
No idea where the hell
she could be?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.463
No, Wherever it is,

05:37.463 --> 05:39.757
she'll die before she ever
lets anyone get in the way

05:39.757 --> 05:41.675
of what she believes.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.592
<i>Hello?</i>

06:23.592 --> 06:24.968
Mom?

06:24.968 --> 06:26.720
<i>I asked you not to call me that.</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.555
Oh, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.724
I just, I needed to talk to you
about something, and...

06:30.724 --> 06:32.601
<i>There's nothing I want to know.</i>

06:34.728 --> 06:37.606
<i>I told you</i>
<i>not to contact me again.</i>

06:37.606 --> 06:39.525
<i>I'm gonna hang up now.</i>

06:39.525 --> 06:42.945
- No, please just, uh...
<i>- Nothing you say</i>
<i>will change anything.</i>

06:42.945 --> 06:44.905
<i>We discussed this.</i>

06:44.905 --> 06:47.324
<i>- Mom?</i>
<i>- I'll be there in a second,</i>
<i>sweetie.</i>

06:50.369 --> 06:51.912
You ha-you have a son?

06:51.912 --> 06:54.039
<i>Goodbye, Lennon.</i>

07:25.988 --> 07:28.574
- Where's your ribbon?
- What?

07:28.574 --> 07:30.784
The ribbon you said you were
getting for my crime mirror.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.871
Uh, I forgot.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.998
What's wrong, bb?

07:39.168 --> 07:40.919
Um...

07:40.919 --> 07:43.380
The-the woman that called
earlier...

07:48.427 --> 07:51.054
It was my mom.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.514
What?

07:52.514 --> 07:54.016
How is that possible?

07:54.016 --> 07:57.436
Hasn't she been dead
for, like, ever?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.897
That-That's what my dad
came to tell me yesterday--

07:59.897 --> 08:02.608
that, um...

08:02.608 --> 08:04.693
She never committed suicide.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.613
She...

08:07.613 --> 08:09.740
she just left.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.284
Oh, my God. This cannot
be happening in real life.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.786
But it is, and she left
with that guy, Fred,

08:14.786 --> 08:16.038
from the cult.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.332
The best man from LinkedIn?

08:18.332 --> 08:21.501
- I spent my whole life thinking
that she was the only one

08:21.501 --> 08:24.296
who ever loved me, and, um...

08:26.590 --> 08:29.509
...turns out she
full-on hates me.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.054
Well, I full on despise her.

08:32.054 --> 08:35.349
I-I mean, it's def illegal
to fake your own death.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.392
- We should call the police
right now.
- No, no.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.269
I-I don't want my-my dad
to get in trouble.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.605
Tea.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.565
Well, we can just find someone

08:43.565 --> 08:45.025
to put rotten shrimp
down her chimney.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.528
I heard about it someplace.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.113
The point is

08:50.113 --> 08:52.616
we can't just let her
walk away pain-free.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.411
Does she know about Alison?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.627
She will now.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.963
Exactly. Fuck her.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.048
I need to go talk to my dad.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.301
What you need
is to make taquitos

09:11.301 --> 09:12.552
and-and watch
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

09:12.552 --> 09:14.012
Like we did
when Johnny broke up with me.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.264
I'll be back. I just...

09:15.264 --> 09:17.182
I need to stop by Dylan's, too.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.684
- I need to make sure he's okay.
- But w...

09:18.684 --> 09:21.186
we decided we were
safer here, together.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.022
I know, I just...

09:24.022 --> 09:27.067
just don't want to lose
anyone else I love.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.569
That includes you.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.591
Lyla and her
asshole buddy cops

09:51.591 --> 09:54.344
didn't do shit for Courtney.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.263
If they let Riri die,
they can put me in jail

09:56.263 --> 09:58.098
for beating her fucking face in.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.474
Cream or sugar?

10:00.517 --> 10:02.269
Can't afford both?
What the fuck?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.481
Take all you want.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.775
Hey.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.321
- Um, I need you
to help find Dylan.
- Dylan?

10:12.321 --> 10:14.197
Lyla's got everyone
searching for Riley.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.992
Um, it's too late for Riley.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.202
How do you know that?

10:23.332 --> 10:24.541
Just...

10:28.879 --> 10:31.465
I just, I-I really thought
I could handle it,

10:31.465 --> 10:33.383
and, um...

10:33.383 --> 10:36.178
now all these people are dead.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.763
I should have told you
after I found the goat head,

10:37.763 --> 10:41.391
but I-I promised everyone,
and I didn't want to worry you

10:41.391 --> 10:43.018
and then Johnny happened,

10:43.018 --> 10:44.644
I saw you with Lyla, and I just,
like, I didn't trust

10:44.644 --> 10:46.313
that you wouldn't tell her,
and...

10:46.313 --> 10:48.940
- and I was so mad
about you and mom, and...
- It's okay.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.278
I mean, it's not okay,
but you're safe.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.282
That's what's most important.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.826
And what about Dylan?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.328
He wasn't at his house.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.662
We have no way
to get in touch with him.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.831
What-what if Clara got him?

11:17.386 --> 11:18.720
<i>What's up?</i>

11:18.720 --> 11:20.680
Hey, it's me. Um...

11:21.890 --> 11:25.811
This is a long shot, but...

11:25.811 --> 11:29.022
I just thought of
some place Clara might be.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.200
He said it was
in the back,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.910
hidden between some rocks.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.502
Kalama.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.754
Right behind you,
Chief.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.797
Oh, my God.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.601
Chief,
there's someone else.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.955
Clara.

13:27.432 --> 13:31.645
<i>My dad said Clara</i>
<i>suffocated herself with honey.</i>

13:31.645 --> 13:34.689
<i>- So twisted.</i>

13:38.318 --> 13:39.986
Oh, my God, Dylan. Hi.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.697
Thank God you're okay. Hey.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.575
Um...

13:47.410 --> 13:49.996
I just came to get my stuff.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.625
Um, where the fuck were you?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.877
I mean, you look rout.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.171
- Like you've been through
something bad.
- It's over.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.509
Okay, that's not a legit answer
to any question ever asked.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.636
They-they found Riley.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.305
I know. I was in the cave
when Clara brought her in.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.641
- Seriously?
- How are you even standing
here?

14:09.641 --> 14:12.060
I escaped through
one of the lava tubes

14:12.060 --> 14:13.853
that led up to the hive.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.814
Like their own secret
passageway to death.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.108
Hey, um, we're-we're
just glad you're okay.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.653
Of course. Tea. That's...
that's what matters.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.365
It's over.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.229
I heard Clara put a tarantula

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
in her prison purse.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.358
Are you referring
to the Arctic wolf spider

15:00.358 --> 15:01.610
she put in her brain?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.361
Yeah.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.196
Same thing.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.744
I'm gonna miss you,
baby girl.

15:10.744 --> 15:14.998
And they better fucking
treat you right in heaven.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.959
Or I'm coming
up there.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.213
You could've been the next Tua.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.846
Ugh, he would despise
that pic.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.855
First concert we went to
as a couple.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.691
I should have known.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.943
I always knew.

15:43.943 --> 15:48.198
I mean, all football players
are kind of gay, right?

15:52.994 --> 15:54.788
I miss you, my Johnny.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.381
Hi.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.091
Hey.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.509
You okay?

16:07.509 --> 16:09.594
I don't know.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.350
There's nothing
you could have done.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.229
Could have
taken Courtney seriously.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.983
Clara had been waiting
for this for 25 years.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.610
Nothing would have stopped her.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.237
Why Doug?

16:28.279 --> 16:30.573
He didn't suspect her at all.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.207
I listened to all your...

16:39.207 --> 16:42.794
...shit headbanger music
to make this.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.296
I still think it sucks.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.761
I'm sorry.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.559
I should have been
a better friend.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.396
I will be.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.148
Next time.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.820
Love you forever, Riri.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.336
I have to go.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.255
Right now?

17:29.340 --> 17:31.718
Tomorrow... my mom's

17:31.718 --> 17:34.262
sending me back
to the Hoffman Institute.

17:34.262 --> 17:38.141
Uh, the Zen retreat

17:38.141 --> 17:39.768
loony bin place I went to

17:39.768 --> 17:42.771
after my breakdown at USC.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.773
Babe, what happened?

17:45.815 --> 17:49.611
I started
mukbanging again.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.780
What's mukbanging?

17:51.780 --> 17:55.283
It's basically like
binge eating for an audience.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.161
- Of, like, millions.
- That sounds bad.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.622
Sorry, Margot.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.374
I just don't deal with grief
very well.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.919
Hopefully, three weeks of

18:05.919 --> 18:09.756
intensive and technology-free
therapy will help.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.136
Gonna miss you.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.472
Me too.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.308
Me too, you guys.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.034
You think we'll ever
stop missing them?

18:40.078 --> 18:42.247
Right now all I feel is sad.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.541
At least they're free.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.501
What?

18:46.501 --> 18:48.795
Their souls are free of pain.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.382
I mean, some of them.

18:57.262 --> 19:01.015
Praying that's just some
weird woo-woo mom shit, but

19:01.015 --> 19:04.394
be careful with that one
while I'm gone, will you?

19:58.781 --> 20:02.035
<i>when it knows...</i>

20:02.035 --> 20:04.996
I am so happy I could die!

20:04.996 --> 20:07.540
Me, too. You look shit,
like, reborn.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.958
- Oh, honestly, so refreshed.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.335
And so much tea.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.003
My roommate was
low-key recovering

20:12.003 --> 20:15.256
- from her addiction
to Timothée Chalamet.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.550
Wait, um, I-I need
to tell Dylan, uh...

20:17.550 --> 20:19.385
- Uh-huh.
- I told him I'd find him
as soon as you got here.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.304
Find My Friends.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.680
You guys got next-level.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.515
Who else was I gonna
hang out with?

20:24.515 --> 20:26.100
My dad and the chief went legit.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.144
- Ew.
- I know.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.145
Where is he?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.153
Why bees?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.780
Because they make honey.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.698
And they pollinate flowers
like these.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.283
But what about
the stings?

20:42.283 --> 20:43.618
No, the stings are just

20:43.618 --> 20:44.869
to protect them.
Just like this

20:44.869 --> 20:47.664
is gonna protect you
over your bed.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.499
Will it work in Tampa?

20:49.499 --> 20:50.833
Do you dream in Tampa?

20:52.085 --> 20:55.129
- Works wherever you dream.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.131
Hey!

20:58.675 --> 21:00.343
New boy band?

21:00.343 --> 21:02.345
Oh, Lennon beat me at Monopoly.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.180
What?
They're hot and you know it.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.766
Well, uh, let me know
if you want me to set you up

21:06.766 --> 21:08.768
with my nail lady.
I mean, those cuticles...

21:08.768 --> 21:11.729
- I'm happy you're back.
- Aw.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.565
- Hey, Mom, I'm gonna
take off, okay?
- Have fun.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.527
And stay away
from the meat products.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.741
That means no playing
with your sausage, Dylan.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.911
- Come on!

21:26.911 --> 21:29.330
Ooh,
I've got a treat for you.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.963
MDMA, your fave.

21:41.259 --> 21:44.387
- Weren't you just in rehab?
- Uh, mental health retreat.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.722
Where do you think I got it?

21:45.722 --> 21:47.515
Serotonin's very therapeutic.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.517
No. Thanks.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.644
Mm, look at you,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.521
inhaling in public.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.189
I got a prescription.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.779
"Empress Touch"]

22:04.449 --> 22:07.452
- Sorry.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.287
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- So bad.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.377
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Oh.

22:25.053 --> 22:29.015
<i>your empress touch...</i>

22:29.015 --> 22:31.809
- Did I tell you
my mom got me a therapy dog?

22:31.809 --> 22:34.812
- I named him "Cheeto."
- Fuck! Why didn't you
bring him?

22:34.812 --> 22:37.732
I tried to leash him and I
don't think he likes me anymore.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.918
- Order's up.
- Thanks.

22:56.918 --> 22:58.586
Ooh, it's so pretty.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.338
- Let me try it.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.340
Hey, biatches.
I know you missed me.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.885
<i>Well, I'm back</i>
<i>with my Lemony.</i>

23:05.885 --> 23:07.261
<i>Mmm. </i>

23:07.261 --> 23:10.598
And our OG BFF--
the deeper Seth Cohen.

23:12.433 --> 23:13.935
He still doesn't understand
my love language.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.269
- I'm gonna go find a seat.
- Whatever.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.272
Like or comment for more.

23:18.272 --> 23:21.359
- I need that inside of me.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.945
Oh, so cold.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.949
I never told you
who bought Snak 'n Stuff.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.867
- Your dad?

23:29.867 --> 23:31.577
- As if. No, the Davenports,

23:31.577 --> 23:34.247
- so that Connor
can build his future.
- Oh.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.626
That place is a literal magnet
for your type.

23:38.626 --> 23:41.629
- Say that again
and I will end you.

23:41.629 --> 23:45.633
Oh, right.
Forgot you love simps now.

23:47.510 --> 23:50.054
No, we're just friends.

23:50.054 --> 23:53.474
Well, I hope your friend
hates your mom as much as we do.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.226
Oh, he doesn't know.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.270
Smart.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.480
Uh, as much as we love him,

23:59.480 --> 24:03.359
he can be a tad... unstable.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.697
Thank you.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.871
You never heard from her
after the obit, huh?

24:14.871 --> 24:16.706
Not surprising.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.833
This woman who pretended
to be dead doesn't give a shit

24:18.833 --> 24:20.835
that her daughter died.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.170
Cunt.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.588
Hi.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.506
That looks good.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.550
I hear there's a wedding
in your future.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.386
I haven't said yes yet.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.762
Oh, she will.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.514
- How could she not?

24:33.514 --> 24:35.391
You must let me
host the bachelorette.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.393
Oh, yeah, for sure.
There's nothing I love more

24:37.393 --> 24:39.520
than smell of male strippers.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.443
- Oh! Oh, my God!

24:45.443 --> 24:48.070
Wow. That is so impressive.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.489
Oh, my God.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.409
Uh, for Cheeto?

24:53.409 --> 24:55.036
Oh.

24:55.036 --> 24:58.039
So sweet, but Cheeto
only likes natural fibers.

24:58.039 --> 25:01.584
Guys, let's get out of here.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.012
Hello?

25:13.012 --> 25:15.264
- What are you waiting for?
- Sorry, sweetie.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.851
I beat the hell
out of this face. No way.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.479
I'm going.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.939
Seriously?

25:22.939 --> 25:24.982
- Just being true
to my best self.
- Whoa!

25:24.982 --> 25:26.817
Okay.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.824
Oh, my God.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.999
- Hey there.
- No, no, no... Aah!

25:41.999 --> 25:45.378
Whoa!
Watch out, just now.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.172
- Because I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:48.172 --> 25:49.715
The fuck, Kyle?!

25:49.715 --> 25:51.676
Your mom's waiting in the Rover.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.311
Lennon? Dylan?

26:03.938 --> 26:05.982
Ooh!

26:05.982 --> 26:08.234
- You almost killed me!

26:08.234 --> 26:10.528
- Well, you're stronger
than you look.

26:10.528 --> 26:12.655
I got to go!

26:12.655 --> 26:14.407
- What?
- No!

26:14.407 --> 26:17.159
- No! You just got back!
- I know.

26:17.159 --> 26:19.328
My mom's being
a literal tiger mom.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.331
Want to sleep over?

26:22.331 --> 26:24.667
What's up?
Are you guys taking off?

26:24.667 --> 26:28.546
I think I'm gonna hang for a
while, but, um, maybe tomorrow.

26:28.546 --> 26:31.007
- Just me and you?
- Definitely.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.216
- Oh, no...
- Love you!

26:34.593 --> 26:36.887
- Keep my girlie safe!

26:36.887 --> 26:38.889
Bye!

26:41.517 --> 26:42.893
Hyah!

26:55.990 --> 26:59.285
<i>on balconies...</i>

26:59.285 --> 27:01.287
Well, that was fun.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.040
Yeah, for sure.

27:17.428 --> 27:19.221
Um...

27:19.221 --> 27:21.182
Uh, your, um... your hoodie.

27:21.182 --> 27:23.517
Do you want
to come inside and hang

27:23.517 --> 27:25.603
- while I put it in the dryer?
- Uh...

27:25.603 --> 27:28.564
We could just, like, um...
we could talk or, uh...

27:28.564 --> 27:30.900
That's okay. You can
give it to me tomorrow.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.610
Okay, cool. Yeah.

27:32.610 --> 27:36.113
Um, yeah, thanks for the ride.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.616
Uh... yeah, sure.

27:38.616 --> 27:41.369
I'll see you later.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.972
- Jesus. Mm.
- I'm sorry.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.682
- Sorry.
- D...

28:44.682 --> 28:46.851
Dylan, what the fuck?

28:48.102 --> 28:50.187
I just...

28:50.187 --> 28:52.940
changed my mind about coming in.

29:01.782 --> 29:06.203
<i>wandering by herself...</i>

29:06.203 --> 29:08.164
So, can I come in?

29:08.164 --> 29:11.876
Yeah. I'll, um...
I'll open the door.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.547
Or not.

29:16.547 --> 29:18.591
Okay. Watch this.
Are you all right?

29:18.591 --> 29:21.260
Yeah. I'm good.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.696
<i>need no help...</i>

29:40.696 --> 29:43.199
- Do you need some help?
- No. Do you?

30:08.516 --> 30:09.808
Do you like that?

30:09.808 --> 30:13.145
Yeah, I mean... kind of.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.315
<i>now, she don't need no help...</i>

30:16.315 --> 30:18.651
Tell me what you want.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.528
I mean, um...

30:20.528 --> 30:22.738
I don't even know
where to start.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.411
If you don't want
to do this, that's cool.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.872
No. I, um...

30:31.872 --> 30:34.750
I definitely
want-want to do this.

30:52.977 --> 30:55.062
<i>at the end of the night...</i>

30:55.062 --> 30:57.606
Uh, I just don't have a...

30:57.606 --> 31:01.193
Oh. I do.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.558
<i>to let it go...</i>

31:32.558 --> 31:35.603
I can't believe
this is finally happening.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.900
I mean... again.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.748
<i>give you my light...</i>

32:20.147 --> 32:22.983
It was better
than last time, right?

32:22.983 --> 32:25.653
Mm, different, for sure.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.624
Okay.

32:40.084 --> 32:42.544
What's your deepest,
darkest secret?

32:43.587 --> 32:45.673
Besides that.

32:47.091 --> 32:49.510
Mm-hmm.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.643
One time, in fifth grade,
I told everyone in class

32:57.643 --> 32:58.644
Delilah Bennett farted

32:58.644 --> 33:01.188
- when it was really me.

33:01.188 --> 33:04.108
And she got teased
the whole day.

33:04.108 --> 33:07.820
Seriously, that's your worst?

33:07.820 --> 33:09.863
That's who I was.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.660
Or thought I was, before.

33:21.959 --> 33:25.087
I bet yours is...
more interesting.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.638
Ah, I don't know.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.643
I could make you tell.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.313
Stop.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.357
Okay, okay, okay.

33:48.485 --> 33:51.029
You look so beautiful right now.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.166
That's 'cause it's me.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.668
- Hi, you.

34:04.668 --> 34:08.172
No, um...

34:08.172 --> 34:11.258
I mean, it...

34:11.258 --> 34:15.888
it's-it's, um, it's me, Dylan.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.766
It's me, Alison.

34:18.766 --> 34:21.018
That's not funny.

34:21.018 --> 34:25.731
It's-it's true. I-I swear, um...

34:25.731 --> 34:27.733
Okay, remember
in-in Ms. Mitchell's class

34:27.733 --> 34:29.651
when she made us stay after
to wash the paint off the...

34:29.651 --> 34:30.903
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

34:34.615 --> 34:37.409
Look, um, I'm sorry.

34:37.409 --> 34:42.080
I've-I've... I've been
wanting to tell you.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.209
That night?

34:49.463 --> 34:51.673
I was, um...

34:51.673 --> 34:55.469
I was so mad at her
for having sex with you.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.013
And then we got
in this huge fight,

34:58.013 --> 34:59.848
and she wasn't even sorry.

34:59.848 --> 35:02.392
And then I took her jacket and
then you guys got in the car

35:02.392 --> 35:05.437
and I-I think I was in shock.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.523
And then the next thing
I knew, I was in Michigan,

35:07.523 --> 35:09.525
living this whole other life.

35:10.526 --> 35:14.196
Living her life.

35:14.196 --> 35:19.159
Look, I-I still
miss her every day.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.870
But then I-I remember
how many times

35:21.870 --> 35:24.498
she told me
to get a fucking life, and...

35:24.498 --> 35:27.918
and that I was smart
and special and...

35:30.546 --> 35:34.132
Look, I know
it sounds insane, but...

35:34.132 --> 35:37.386
I know this is what
she would have wanted.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.640
Before or after

35:41.640 --> 35:45.018
you let her bleed out
on the side of the road?

35:45.018 --> 35:47.020
That's not what happened.
She was already dead.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.523
You-you know that.
It was an accident.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.774
Stealing her identity wasn't.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.901
Lying to me wasn't.
Letting me think

35:52.901 --> 35:55.237
it was my fault she was
on the road that night wasn't.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.364
You had so many chances
to tell the truth.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.658
Okay, look, I-I wanted to.
You wouldn't talk to me.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.159
Do not blame me
for your fucking lies!

36:01.159 --> 36:03.579
Okay, I... I'm not.
I'm not. I'm sorry.

36:04.621 --> 36:08.375
I mean, did it turn you on

36:08.375 --> 36:11.712
to fuck me while you pretended
to be somebody else?

36:11.712 --> 36:14.131
No. I-I wanted
to tell you before.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.799
Look, that's why
I'm telling you now,

36:15.799 --> 36:17.217
so that we don't
have any secrets.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.428
Do you know what you did to me?

36:19.428 --> 36:21.013
What I did because of you?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.183
What-what does that even mean?

36:25.183 --> 36:26.685
- What did you do?
- I should have known

36:26.685 --> 36:28.395
you and Margot were
playing some sick game.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.647
No. Margot has nothing to do
with this. She doesn't know.

36:30.647 --> 36:33.567
D-Dylan, look, nobody does, and
if anyone found out, you know

36:33.567 --> 36:34.985
- what would happen.
- Why should I give a shit

36:34.985 --> 36:36.778
what happens to you?
I don't even know you.

36:41.658 --> 36:44.620
I'm sorry I'm not
your sad pixie dream girl.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.538
I'm-I'm fucked up.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.082
I've always been fucked up,
but I'm still Alison,

36:49.082 --> 36:50.792
the person you said you loved.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.379
You're not the Alison I knew.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.381
Seriously? And who are you?

36:56.381 --> 36:58.800
Someone I never wanted to be.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.762
What does...
what does that even mean?

37:01.762 --> 37:03.639
What happened that night
when Clara died,

37:03.639 --> 37:04.723
when you were
in the cave with her?

37:04.723 --> 37:07.643
I set her free.

37:24.201 --> 37:26.745
We should go to Kauai,

37:26.745 --> 37:29.247
do something small
with your mom and the kids.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.792
You're really
freaking me out right now.

37:31.792 --> 37:35.045
Come on. After the summer
we've had?

37:35.045 --> 37:37.297
You don't want to do something
a little romantic?

37:37.297 --> 37:39.591
You want to know what I want?

37:39.591 --> 37:41.176
A big-ass rock.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.761
- Like J.
- Lo's.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.389
- What's that-- ten carats, 15?

37:45.389 --> 37:48.141
I got meaty fingers.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.687
Okay. Yeah, I knew
that would scare you off.

37:51.687 --> 37:53.647
Oh, not at all.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.065
Big rock.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.693
I got it.
See you tomorrow.

37:57.693 --> 38:01.029
You're-you're literally running
away on your cold-ass feet?

38:01.029 --> 38:02.447
Love you.

38:19.089 --> 38:22.217
Cheeto,
this is what happens

38:22.217 --> 38:24.928
when the drugs wear off.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.097
Ooh.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.975
Mmm.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.936
Don't tell Mom. She doesn't
approve of processed sugars.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.900
Okay. Stay, okay?

38:38.900 --> 38:40.986
Hey, Cheeto? Sit.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.405
Good boy.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.869
Mmm.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.206
You want a bite, Cheeto?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.336
Cheeto?

39:01.923 --> 39:04.009
Cheeto?

39:06.428 --> 39:09.056
Cheeto?

39:11.224 --> 39:12.809
Cheeto.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.774
Cheeto?

39:21.318 --> 39:23.361
Cheeto?

39:24.946 --> 39:27.949
Cheeto.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.633
Cheeto?

39:50.931 --> 39:52.808
Hello?

39:58.480 --> 40:00.774
Aah!

40:11.618 --> 40:15.539
I'll take care of it.
Just, uh...

40:15.539 --> 40:17.666
stick to the story, okay?

40:19.042 --> 40:21.044
Listen, I have something
to deal with, then I'll be home.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.046
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

40:23.046 --> 40:25.757
And, uh, keep me posted
about Margot.

40:33.598 --> 40:36.351
Maybe a bit more symmetry
when you're in there.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.894
Thank you.

40:37.894 --> 40:41.231
Lennon. She'll be so happy
to see you.

40:41.231 --> 40:42.858
Oh, what happened?

40:42.858 --> 40:45.485
She tripped over the dog.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.488
You know how many times
I told her not to quit ballet?

40:52.117 --> 40:56.705
Margot? Hey.

40:56.705 --> 40:59.082
- You came.

40:59.082 --> 41:02.127
Oh, babe.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.212
Does it look bad?

41:04.212 --> 41:06.256
No.

41:06.256 --> 41:09.217
My mom won't let anyone but
the plastic surgeon touch it.

41:09.217 --> 41:13.013
I mean... it is my face.

41:13.013 --> 41:15.348
You still look beautiful.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.475
Someone pushed me.

41:17.475 --> 41:21.188
What? Your-your mom
said you-you tripped.

41:21.188 --> 41:25.150
Shh. If I told her the truth,
she'd send me away again,

41:25.150 --> 41:27.235
or call the police.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.446
And-and what would-what would
I tell them?

41:29.446 --> 41:32.199
That someone tried to kill me
because we killed Alison?

41:32.199 --> 41:34.201
Do you... I... Do you really
think it's about that?

41:34.201 --> 41:35.952
Everything has been fine
since Clara died.

41:35.952 --> 41:39.331
Maybe it wasn't her
and whoever it was

41:39.331 --> 41:41.541
was just waiting
for me to come home.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.877
And you didn't you see anything?

41:43.877 --> 41:45.962
I bet Cheeto did.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.090
- If only dogs could talk.
- I'm sorry.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.343
I should have been there
with you.

41:51.343 --> 41:54.429
Hi, Margot.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.765
Let's put that pretty face
back together

41:56.765 --> 41:58.767
and get you out of here.

41:58.767 --> 42:01.228
"Spill My Guts"]

42:28.546 --> 42:30.674
What the fuck
are you doing here?

42:30.674 --> 42:35.136
<i>to your face...</i>

42:35.136 --> 42:38.265
You should have told me
our daughter died.

42:48.984 --> 42:51.278
I'm gonna look heinous.

42:51.278 --> 42:53.029
It's not possible.

42:53.029 --> 42:56.032
Thanks for being with me, Lemon.

42:56.032 --> 42:58.785
It's where I want to be.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.757
<i>to your face...</i>

43:12.757 --> 43:14.384
Come closer.

43:14.384 --> 43:17.721
I-I don't... I don't
want to hurt you.

43:17.721 --> 43:19.681
You won't.

43:39.075 --> 43:41.119
You're supposed to be dead.

43:42.203 --> 43:43.288
But I'm not.

43:59.387 --> 44:01.348
Can I help you, sir?

44:01.348 --> 44:03.850
I need
to speak to the chief.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.852
Sorry. She won't be in
'till morning.

44:06.895 --> 44:09.022
- I'll wait.
- Great.

44:09.022 --> 44:11.149
Have a seat for me
over there, please.

44:21.618 --> 44:24.954
You have them, too.

46:29.704 --> 46:31.289
Whee!
