01:36.600 --> 01:39.930
My mother is not getting enough exercise.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.225
- We're doing everything possible.
- Why is she fed in her room?

01:43.733 --> 01:45.892
We can't move everybody
to the dining hall.

01:46.067 --> 01:48.862
She needs to be
around other people.

01:49.033 --> 01:51.397
When she gets better
she can participate.

01:51.567 --> 01:56.329
She's not going to get better
unless you keep her mobile.

01:56.501 --> 02:00.729
If your mother were strong enough
she'd get more exercise.

02:01.367 --> 02:04.129
You promised hydrotherap y
and a full-time staff.

02:04.300 --> 02:08.960
- We'll do more when she's ready.
- Do I have to supervise it myself?

02:09.134 --> 02:14.193
Dr. Benton, your mother broke her hip.
She won't heal overnight.

02:18.001 --> 02:19.967
Yeah.

02:20.135 --> 02:22.328
Thank you.

02:22.635 --> 02:27.260
Chloe has no insurance. If you'd just
spare a couple of hundred dollars...?

02:27.435 --> 02:29.367
I've got to go, Mom. Bye.

02:32.402 --> 02:36.357
- Is our chief resident in?
- He should be here any minute.

02:36.535 --> 02:41.025
I need him for Joint Commission
surveyors tonight for two hours.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.191
- Rolando?
- Yeah...

02:44.536 --> 02:47.161
I love chaos, but this is overdoing it.

02:47.336 --> 02:49.825
I'm slow today, I've got a cold.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.764
Call a replacement, go home.

02:52.936 --> 02:56.197
- Is he a jerk?
- I don't know yet.

02:56.369 --> 02:58.165
Carter?

02:58.336 --> 03:01.098
Fadenhecht, Isidore.
Caught in a metal press.

03:01.270 --> 03:04.599
Multiple lacs, BP 80 over 30,
pulse 135, thready.

03:04.770 --> 03:07.202
- How much blood loss?
- 500cc's.

03:10.437 --> 03:13.925
Move him up slow,
he's busted up enough. On three.

03:14.103 --> 03:16.160
Got it? One, two, three.

03:16.337 --> 03:20.269
- Mental status at scene?
- GCS 3-4-4. Had back pain.

03:20.437 --> 03:21.869
No kidding.

03:22.037 --> 03:25.469
- Stopped 18 minutes ago.
- Cross-table C-spine and chest.

03:25.637 --> 03:28.069
- What size tube?
- Seven.

03:28.238 --> 03:30.397
- Any I. D?
- Pulse ox 85.

03:30.570 --> 03:34.128
- Put him on a ventilator.
- Pulse is weak, BP is falling.

03:34.304 --> 03:38.134
Three large bore IVs,
normal saline, wide open.

03:38.304 --> 03:41.395
- Tube's in. Bag him.
- There's no pulse down here.

03:41.571 --> 03:44.731
Call a surgeon
before this guy loses his leg.

03:46.972 --> 03:50.563
- Dr. Ross needs a surgeon.
- I'm on with them now.

03:50.738 --> 03:55.000
- Have you reorganized my x-rays?
- Dr. Ross needs you. Crush case.

03:55.172 --> 03:57.433
- Somebody gown me.
- Trouble, Peter.

03:57.605 --> 04:01.163
Absent femoral, popliteal
and dorsalis pedis pulses.

04:02.239 --> 04:05.205
- No cap refill.
- BP 70 over 30.

04:05.372 --> 04:07.338
Internally rotated
and shortened, Carter.

04:07.506 --> 04:10.199
- Fracture?
- Posterior dislocation.

04:10.372 --> 04:12.531
Give me some room here.

04:12.706 --> 04:15.695
Carter, hold his pelvis down.

04:15.873 --> 04:18.031
Doug, stabilize his neck.

04:18.204 --> 04:22.070
One, two, three.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.001
- I felt a pop!
- Good.

04:25.173 --> 04:28.401
- It's back in.
- Distal pulse is back.

04:28.573 --> 04:31.130
- Well done, Peter.
- Call Ortho.

04:31.306 --> 04:33.772
- You saved his leg.
- Yeah, well...

04:33.939 --> 04:36.735
Legs are something
I can save today.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.500
- Mark?
- Hi.

05:27.675 --> 05:31.368
- How did it go with Jen?
- I never got there.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.132
She didn't want me to come up.

05:34.876 --> 05:39.036
Wild Willie wants you
to stay after your shift.

05:39.209 --> 05:40.697
I can't do it.

05:40.876 --> 05:46.104
Now's the time to earn points
if you still want to be an attending.

05:48.076 --> 05:50.099
Mark?

05:50.276 --> 05:55.470
She said I could come up tonight.
I have to make a 7:30 train.

05:57.276 --> 06:01.073
You know, I remember
when we used to fight.

06:01.243 --> 06:07.268
I wouldn't talk for a couple of days,
but I knew things would work out.

06:07.443 --> 06:09.932
This time I'm not so sure.

06:15.310 --> 06:17.741
- Treatment for Legionnaires'?
- Erythromycin.

06:17.910 --> 06:22.070
- The Boards are four months away.
- I'm bad on tests.

06:22.244 --> 06:24.608
A kid's coming in
with sudden hearing loss.

06:24.778 --> 06:27.107
- I'll take the baby in Two.
- Okay.

06:28.344 --> 06:33.039
- Carter, what about next year?
- I'm waiting on that surgical sub-I.

06:33.211 --> 06:37.041
What about the ER sub-I?
Mark would recommend you.

06:37.211 --> 06:39.473
- He's studying again.
- Really?

06:39.644 --> 06:42.804
I heard they raised
the Boards' failure rate.

06:42.978 --> 06:46.103
<i>- Dr. Benton needs you in Four.</i>
- It went up to 10%.

06:46.278 --> 06:48.767
- Seven students failed last year.
- Seven?

06:48.944 --> 06:53.037
- Dr. Ross, Katie's got a problem.
- Hey, what can we do for you?

06:53.211 --> 06:57.507
- Katie's kind of shell-shocked.
- As in "combat"?

06:57.678 --> 06:59.144
She can't hear a thing.

06:59.311 --> 07:03.301
It's "Take-your-daughter-to-work" day.
She pulled her muffs off on the firing range.

07:03.478 --> 07:06.536
- Katie, do you hear a ringing?
- What?

07:06.712 --> 07:10.008
- You hear this?
- What is that?

07:12.546 --> 07:17.035
- That's louder.
- Wendy, call ENT for audiometry.

07:17.212 --> 07:20.110
I want to rule out
any middle ear damage.

07:20.279 --> 07:22.871
- Where do you work?
- Great Lakes Naval Base.

07:23.046 --> 07:25.978
I took her to morning gunnery exercises.

07:26.147 --> 07:29.510
Why is there a naval base
on Lake Michigan?

07:29.679 --> 07:32.907
Who's gonna invade? Canadians?

07:34.013 --> 07:37.843
- It only happens when he's eating.
- Hold still, Henry.

07:38.013 --> 07:40.844
- Not in the mornings.
- Bounding pulses.

07:41.013 --> 07:44.969
- Every night his lips turn blue.
- Please let him listen.

07:48.714 --> 07:51.078
- It's his heart, isn't it?
- It's not your fault.

07:51.247 --> 07:55.203
It's my family's genes.
They all have heart problems.

07:55.381 --> 07:59.245
We need a chest x-ray and an EKG.

07:59.415 --> 08:01.812
Go on, tell me.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.675
I hear a murmur.

08:05.715 --> 08:09.147
- It's his heart, isn't it?
- I think so.

08:13.181 --> 08:15.443
- Girl coming in with head trauma.
- Page Benton.

08:15.615 --> 08:17.843
Wanted my daughter to be a doctor...

08:18.015 --> 08:21.538
...but she's a hostess
at a Hungarian restaurant.

08:21.715 --> 08:23.238
Zsa Zsa's from Budapest.

08:23.416 --> 08:27.041
- Locked her up...
- Mrs. Dibble, you need to stay in bed.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.340
- Why?
- You stopped taking your lithium.

08:29.516 --> 08:32.004
Malik, take Mrs. Dibble to Three.

08:32.182 --> 08:34.943
Don't touch me. I am coming.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.912
You're handsome. We could go
to my place for dinner.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.412
We'd have a lot of fun...

08:40.582 --> 08:44.947
Bipolar. They found her in Grant
Park sweeping the sidewalks.

08:45.116 --> 08:48.105
I feel lucky to have
the right brain chemicals.

08:48.283 --> 08:51.340
- You okay?
- Fine. How's Chloe?

08:51.517 --> 08:54.778
She wears all my clothes,
never washes the dishes...

08:54.949 --> 08:58.074
- She's coming for an ultrasound.
- You sound so enthusiastic.

08:58.250 --> 09:01.341
I'll help her out, but she's
not gonna run my life.

09:01.517 --> 09:04.847
- I'm not gonna do it this time.
- Dr. Greene.

09:05.550 --> 09:08.311
I need you for two hours
at the end of your shift.

09:08.483 --> 09:12.347
- Joint Commission survey.
- I can't. It's a bad night.

09:12.517 --> 09:16.813
- Sure, it's gonna rain. I need you.
- I have personal business.

09:16.984 --> 09:19.609
Since when do residents
have a personal life?

09:19.784 --> 09:21.977
I'm sorry. I do tonight.

09:24.984 --> 09:27.973
Well, I guess I'll do it myself.

09:29.384 --> 09:31.577
Screw him. Do what you have to do.

09:31.751 --> 09:35.808
- She's really pale.
- She must have slipped in the hall.

09:35.985 --> 09:38.746
I'm her homeroom teacher.
She was bleeding.

09:38.918 --> 09:40.884
She's hypotensive. 60 palp.

09:41.051 --> 09:44.574
Let's take her and shake her
on my count. One, two, three.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.115
- Haleh, cut off this bandage.
- She's breathing really hard.

09:49.285 --> 09:51.615
- Does she use drugs?
- No, not Samantha.

09:51.786 --> 09:55.081
- Is there a history of seizures?
- I don't know.

09:55.252 --> 09:58.377
Pupils equal and reactive to light.
What do you think, Carter?

09:58.552 --> 10:02.450
Could be a blood clot, bleeding
in the brain. Seizure disorder.

10:02.619 --> 10:04.949
Let's get a head CT, CBC, Chem-7.

10:05.119 --> 10:08.607
- Run a blood sugar.
- BP's down to 60 over nothing.

10:08.786 --> 10:10.752
- Arrhythmia. V-tach.
- She's crashing!

10:10.919 --> 10:15.045
What the hell is happening?
Paddles! Move! 100!

10:16.919 --> 10:18.215
- Clear!
- Clear.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.743
- No, I hate psychiatrists.
- You've put this off long enough.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.909
A guy kicked his daughter out
of a window and I slugged him.

10:26.087 --> 10:30.179
- Go see the shrink, Doug.
- The guy didn't sue.

10:30.353 --> 10:34.809
I need to close the file.
Allan Murphy, room 607, 3 p.m.

10:34.987 --> 10:38.646
Are you doing your job or
is it because I'm so wonderful?

10:38.820 --> 10:42.480
- I'm sort of fond of you.
- Ouch.

10:42.654 --> 10:48.177
- I get kidney infections.
- As a urologist, you should know better.

10:48.354 --> 10:51.718
- Why didn't you take Bactrim?
- Physician heel thyself.

10:51.888 --> 10:54.013
We never do.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.881
- Where do you practice?
- Seattle. Evangeline.

10:58.054 --> 11:00.576
We have a great ER,
but the weather stinks.

11:00.754 --> 11:03.618
That's it. Flank tenderness.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.754
Temp 98.9.

11:05.921 --> 11:09.376
Gimme a 100 meperidine for pain.

11:09.555 --> 11:13.510
- Let's make the diagnosis first.
- It hurts like hell.

11:13.688 --> 11:18.848
I'm sure your diagnosis is correct,
but let's get a urinalysis.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.287
- BP is still down.
- Her glucose is through the roof.

11:24.455 --> 11:28.218
Oh, God, it's not a seizure.
IV loading dose insulin 10 units.

11:28.389 --> 11:31.378
Start an infusion, 5 units an hour.
Carter, come here.

11:33.789 --> 11:37.119
- Her coma is not from head trauma.
- Smells like fruit.

11:37.289 --> 11:39.755
Diabetic coma.
She has ketoacidosis.

11:39.922 --> 11:42.787
Get a blood gas.
Run in a liter of saline wide open.

11:42.956 --> 11:45.854
- Did she eat anything today?
- We had a birthday party.

11:46.023 --> 11:49.750
She had chocolate cake
and I think some ice cream.

11:49.923 --> 11:54.151
- Why is a diabetic eating sugar?
- I didn't know she was diabetic.

11:54.323 --> 11:58.755
Call me when the Chem-7 is back.
I want a potassium every 30 minutes.

11:58.923 --> 12:02.549
- I can turn the case over to Ross.
- I said I want a potassium.

12:02.724 --> 12:04.485
Carter, stitch her head.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.817
What do you want? 6-0 nylon?

12:11.991 --> 12:15.048
I have nightmares that I'm
getting married in a peach gown.

12:15.223 --> 12:18.849
- I kind of like peach.
- You don't wear it every day.

12:19.024 --> 12:22.218
Why do nurses wear colors
and doctors white?

12:22.391 --> 12:25.255
- Doctors are pure and good.
- Does that include me?

12:25.425 --> 12:29.517
- No.
- A Linda Farrell called.

12:29.691 --> 12:31.486
That sounds familiar.

12:31.658 --> 12:34.590
- You used to date her?
- That's right.

12:34.758 --> 12:39.281
Dr. Greene, rescue 64's bringing
in a bleeding drunk.

12:39.458 --> 12:44.084
Mark? Tag and I need a ring bearer
and we'd love to have Rachel.

12:44.259 --> 12:48.714
That'll be great. I don't know
where we're gonna be in May.

12:48.892 --> 12:52.688
I have to ask Jennifer,
but I'm sure it'll be fine.

12:52.858 --> 12:57.314
- Susie! Hey.
- You look great in my jacket.

12:57.492 --> 13:00.925
- I don't feel great. I'm scared.
- Don't worry, it'll be okay.

13:01.092 --> 13:04.616
I broke your blender.
I was trying to make a milk shake...

13:04.793 --> 13:07.021
Blenders break.

13:07.592 --> 13:10.422
Why are you being so nice to me?

13:10.592 --> 13:13.649
Because you're not going
to screw up anymore, right?

13:13.826 --> 13:17.122
- Vomiting blood.
- BP 90 over 60, pulse thready at 145.

13:17.293 --> 13:19.384
Smells like he's been
putting it away all day.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.889
- Did he hit his head?
- Negative.

13:23.727 --> 13:27.159
- What's your name, sir?
- Screw off, bitch!

13:27.326 --> 13:30.520
Just what I need today.
Let's move him on one, two, three.

13:30.693 --> 13:34.921
CBC, Chem-7, coag panel,
chest x-ray, LFTs, EKG.

13:35.094 --> 13:37.582
- Mary...?
- Start an IV D5W.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.487
I want a '66 Malibu.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.422
- Best engine Chevy ever made.
- What's your name, sir?

13:42.593 --> 13:44.560
Reicher.

13:44.727 --> 13:50.490
I like the MG ' 56,
that was a great car.

13:50.661 --> 13:52.286
I like the Triumph myself.

13:52.461 --> 13:54.086
Set up for endoscop y.

13:54.261 --> 13:57.750
- Who are you? Where am I?
- How much did you drink today?

13:57.928 --> 14:00.053
Stuff it, will you?

14:00.227 --> 14:03.887
- We're gonna need to sedate him.
- Droperidol, 2.5 mgs.

14:04.061 --> 14:06.357
- He'll need a Foley.
- I'll do it.

14:06.528 --> 14:10.722
- I'm gonna puke.
- Not on the floor, we'll get a basin.

14:10.895 --> 14:12.555
Give him 100 of thiamine.

14:12.728 --> 14:15.422
Suction on, give me the scope.

14:16.762 --> 14:19.489
Get suction ready.

14:19.662 --> 14:23.651
- Is he doped up enough?
- He seems pretty out of it.

14:28.196 --> 14:29.593
All right, this is a test.

14:29.929 --> 14:33.327
Are we looking
at a peptic ulcer, varices?

14:33.762 --> 14:35.728
- Or Mallory-Weiss?
- Peptic ulcer.

14:36.129 --> 14:37.788
- Varices.
- You're both right.

14:38.229 --> 14:40.457
Let's cauterize the bleeder.

14:40.630 --> 14:45.153
Mr. Reicher, you're gonna be fine.
You drank yourself into an ulcer.

14:45.329 --> 14:48.887
- The taxpayers will buy you out of it.
- Mark, is he stable?

14:49.062 --> 14:51.654
They need you for a residents' meeting.
I'll finish this.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.659
Alright, thanks.

14:53.830 --> 14:58.263
- Let's get Radiology down here.
- Blood sugar is 95.

15:05.330 --> 15:08.421
- Did you take care of me today?
- Yes, you should be lying down.

15:08.597 --> 15:10.620
I'm getting my medicine now.

15:10.798 --> 15:13.559
- Do I look old to you?
- No, you don't.

15:13.731 --> 15:18.390
I feel old. I feel like nothing good
is ever gonna happen to me.

15:18.564 --> 15:21.359
I'm sorry. I've been begging
Psych to take her.

15:21.531 --> 15:26.486
It's hard to be happ y, you can't try,
it comes or it doesn't.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.020
Blood pressure's normal, pH 7.3.

15:34.198 --> 15:37.187
Run a rhythm strip.
Give 20 milliequivalent of KCL.

15:37.365 --> 15:39.763
- We got ahold of her mother.
- Good.

15:41.064 --> 15:43.826
- At least her heart's steady.
- Didn't take her insulin today.

15:43.999 --> 15:45.794
All week.

15:45.965 --> 15:48.227
Run a potassium every 30 minutes.
Let me know.

15:48.398 --> 15:51.558
She's not a surgical patient,
you don't have to do this.

15:51.732 --> 15:53.255
Just keep me posted.

15:57.533 --> 16:01.090
I think it's the flu. He told me to go home.
Can you come in?

16:01.266 --> 16:03.357
Hurry.

16:03.533 --> 16:06.761
Ronson's discharged. Loomis to X-ray.

16:07.666 --> 16:11.792
- I'm looking for Lewis Reicher.
- We have a Lew Reicher.

16:11.966 --> 16:14.557
My husband. Is he all right?

16:15.666 --> 16:17.791
Maybe we reached the wrong family.

16:18.367 --> 16:19.593
No, he's my husband.

16:19.766 --> 16:23.164
Did he talk about his cars?
He likes to talk about his cars.

16:24.267 --> 16:29.666
Your husband is fine now,
but he does have a bleeding ulcer.

16:29.833 --> 16:34.391
- He was found on the street.
- That's where he lives.

16:35.066 --> 16:37.033
Don't ask me to explain.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.758
I can't even explain it to my daughter,
I sure can't explain it to you.

16:42.600 --> 16:47.260
Your husband's been moved upstairs,
if you'd like to see him.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.294
I brought him some clean clothes.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.831
Sure, but he's awake, if you
want to talk to him.

16:54.001 --> 16:56.763
I just wanted to see if he was alive.

17:03.768 --> 17:06.256
- So Chloe is staying with you?
- Not for long.

17:06.435 --> 17:07.423
She okay?

17:07.601 --> 17:11.364
Yeah, considering she's been living
on Twinkies and popcorn.

17:11.535 --> 17:14.093
Mother of your diabetic
is on her way in.

17:14.269 --> 17:19.065
Dr. Strong's urine test. Seems he
belongs to a different species.

17:19.234 --> 17:23.531
He signs his name Dr. Lyle Strong,
then follows it with M.D.

17:25.368 --> 17:27.425
What is taking so long?

17:27.602 --> 17:30.693
- This pain is killing me.
- I'm sorry.

17:31.036 --> 17:33.593
Your test results aren't good.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.526
- What?
- You know the differential diagnosis.

17:36.702 --> 17:40.191
You have an aplastic, bicystic
renal neoplasm.

17:40.636 --> 17:43.467
- No, it couldn't be that.
- You're right.

17:43.769 --> 17:47.600
Because there's no such thing.
The blood in your urine was from a chicken.

17:47.770 --> 17:48.793
There's some mistake.

17:48.969 --> 17:52.231
Your story's so good, we ought to
give you any painkiller you want.

17:52.403 --> 17:56.199
But then you'd be back for more.
Do you read medical textbooks?

17:56.370 --> 17:59.098
- I'm a doctor.
- You're a drug addict.

17:59.270 --> 18:01.702
What do the cops do in cases like this?

18:02.237 --> 18:03.328
Mr. Strong, stop!

18:04.104 --> 18:05.831
Mr. Strong!

18:07.337 --> 18:09.030
Is that the new spring fashion?

18:09.870 --> 18:13.701
Henry may have a hole between
his aorta and pulmonary arteries.

18:13.870 --> 18:18.132
He turns blue because he's not
getting enough oxygenated blood.

18:18.304 --> 18:21.498
I knew it. My whole damn family.

18:21.671 --> 18:24.796
- It's not genetic.
- Everything is genetic.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.903
He said it can be corrected. Right?

18:27.371 --> 18:30.167
Open-heart surgery will close the hole.

18:30.938 --> 18:33.563
Eight weeks old
and they'll cut his heart open.

18:33.738 --> 18:37.795
- It's a common operation.
- Then do it to somebody else.

18:39.038 --> 18:41.163
I'm sorry.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.834
I wanted everything to be okay.

18:44.572 --> 18:48.402
It's not your fault. It just happens.

18:52.739 --> 18:55.637
- Doug?
- Hey, buddy.

18:55.806 --> 18:59.795
- Do I have to call you Dr. Ross?
- Call me anything you want.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.530
- How about "airhead"?
- Wiseass.

19:02.705 --> 19:06.263
- Do you work Saturday mornings?
- Sometimes. Why?

19:06.440 --> 19:09.497
Could you get, like,
12 Saturdays off in a row?

19:09.673 --> 19:12.104
And some Tuesdays and Wednesdays?

19:12.273 --> 19:15.501
- Is this a test?
- My Little League team...

19:15.673 --> 19:20.696
...we need an assistant coach.
It's 18 games and two practices a week.

19:20.873 --> 19:23.101
I should be able to make most of them.

19:23.274 --> 19:25.466
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, great.

19:25.640 --> 19:26.833
Dougie.

19:27.807 --> 19:31.103
My name is Doug,
You never call a grownup "Dougie."

19:31.274 --> 19:34.399
Since when did you grow up?

19:34.574 --> 19:39.006
I just closed a huge deal in Neuro.
Want to celebrate with me?

19:41.607 --> 19:44.334
- Jake, this is Linda. Linda, Jake.
- Hi.

19:44.507 --> 19:45.905
Hi.

19:46.908 --> 19:48.533
So, we celebrate?

19:48.707 --> 19:52.764
- What about what's-his-name?
- Brian. Boston, business.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.430
I'll buy you ribs at Carson's. 8:30?

19:57.741 --> 20:00.071
I can't.

20:00.241 --> 20:03.639
Why did we stop seeing each other?
I miss you a little.

20:03.809 --> 20:05.240
All you had to do was marry me.

20:08.108 --> 20:10.267
I don't miss you that much.

20:11.475 --> 20:14.169
I gotta go. Bye.

20:17.276 --> 20:20.799
- Do you go out with her or something?
- I used to.

20:20.975 --> 20:23.533
- But not now?
- Listen, Jake...

20:23.875 --> 20:25.432
...do you know what flirting is?

20:25.609 --> 20:28.097
That's what she was doing.
People do it all the time.

20:28.276 --> 20:30.242
It doesn't mean a thing.

20:31.209 --> 20:33.698
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:34.043 --> 20:37.702
I was hoping for a miracle.
I'm glad you still visit her.

20:37.876 --> 20:40.433
I like her, she's stuff,
and it's on my way to class.

20:40.609 --> 20:43.837
- Keeping surgeon's hours?
- That's what Al says.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.067
How do you keep a marriage together?
I couldn't do it.

20:47.243 --> 20:51.937
After the physician's assistant course
we'll have a normal life.

20:52.110 --> 20:54.474
I get a break at seven.
Want to grab dinner?

20:56.744 --> 20:59.710
- I don't know.
- It's just dinner.

21:01.310 --> 21:02.936
- Okay.
- Dr. Benton?

21:03.111 --> 21:06.543
Can you see Charlie?
They brought him from school.

21:08.077 --> 21:11.668
- Fine-looking woman. Married, huh?
- So what's the problem?

21:11.844 --> 21:15.538
My leg feels funny and my arm.
I can't move it.

21:15.710 --> 21:18.972
- Have you been sick lately?
- I had the flu.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.636
We drop a lot of people. Get ready.

21:24.878 --> 21:29.004
It doesn't look surgical.
I'll work him up, but find Dr. Ross.

21:31.078 --> 21:35.908
- When did your leg get sore?
- This morning. A little last night.

21:36.078 --> 21:39.703
- You have any headaches?
- From the flu. I'm still sick.

21:39.878 --> 21:42.208
Yeah, everybody has it.

21:43.412 --> 21:45.843
Have you fallen in the last few days?

21:46.012 --> 21:49.967
- I tripped over my little brother.
- They get in the way, don't they?

21:50.345 --> 21:55.277
- Does your head hurt?
- No, just my arm and my back a little.

21:55.446 --> 21:59.936
- Diabetic's mother is here.
- Possible left-sided hemiparesis.

22:00.113 --> 22:04.341
- Dr. Ross is gonna take care of you, okay?
- Thanks.

22:06.113 --> 22:08.341
- He's nice.
- He's a prince.

22:08.513 --> 22:09.910
Carter!

22:10.879 --> 22:13.868
Your tests are okay,
but you need to start eating more.

22:14.046 --> 22:18.843
- I never ate right.
- Put that down, please.

22:19.447 --> 22:23.402
I've been screwing up so long
maybe I can't do anything right.

22:23.580 --> 22:27.206
- This time you'll try harder.
- Open wide.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.972
Chloe, can you listen to me
for one second?

22:31.147 --> 22:35.341
I may not be a doctor,
but I'm giving Mom a grandchild.

22:35.514 --> 22:39.503
Yeah, just what she wants.
She'll be thrilled.

22:41.914 --> 22:46.370
An OB is gonna do an ultrasound.
Then you'll shop for baby stuff.

22:46.548 --> 22:49.140
Shop till I drop. Cool.

22:51.414 --> 22:55.245
- I shouldn't eat ice cream.
- You should've taken insulin today.

22:55.414 --> 22:59.870
- And yesterday and the day before.
- What are you talking about?

23:00.048 --> 23:02.480
You took it, Sam, didn't you?

23:04.282 --> 23:07.907
- Mommy, it wouldn't...
- Oh, Sam!

23:08.549 --> 23:12.242
I'm tired of being sick.
I don't want to be different.

23:12.615 --> 23:16.911
I'll go blind. I've read it in the encyclopedia.
It's not fair.

23:19.382 --> 23:20.871
You...

23:24.383 --> 23:26.974
You have an illness.

23:27.149 --> 23:30.206
You want to pretend you don't.

23:30.383 --> 23:33.008
Where's that gonna get you?

23:35.149 --> 23:36.376
I don't know.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.377
You have to accept the way things are.

23:40.216 --> 23:44.013
So maybe you won't be exactly
like everybody else...

23:44.184 --> 23:46.741
...but if you don't take your insulin...

23:48.350 --> 23:50.282
...you'll die.

23:58.017 --> 24:00.575
I'll be back to check on you.

24:05.350 --> 24:07.908
The way you talked to her was great.

24:08.084 --> 24:10.845
2:30. I have to do a hydrocele.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.809
Push down like on a gas pedal.

24:16.151 --> 24:17.707
Okay.

24:17.951 --> 24:21.678
- You like to drive, Charlie?
- Yeah, I just got my license.

24:21.851 --> 24:25.545
- Squeeze my hand. Harder.
- I'm trying.

24:26.819 --> 24:30.546
Malik here is gonna take you for
an MRI. Do you know what that is?

24:30.785 --> 24:35.115
You lie in this big tunnel which takes
pictures of the inside of your head.

24:35.285 --> 24:37.342
Why? It's my leg that hurts.

24:37.518 --> 24:40.712
Because I'm the doctor
and that's what I want to do.

24:40.885 --> 24:43.317
Malik, can I talk to you?

24:45.219 --> 24:48.981
- He didn't have any strength.
- Find his parents.

24:49.152 --> 24:51.516
Tell Radiology to put him ahead.

24:51.686 --> 24:54.880
Tell Benton to look at the MRI
and get a Neuro consult.

24:57.453 --> 25:01.408
Head's okay. It's a good position.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.278
Looks like a little girl.

25:04.553 --> 25:06.348
A girl!

25:07.120 --> 25:10.280
- How's the weight?
- Look at her move. Her hand...

25:10.454 --> 25:12.646
Weight's on the low side.

25:12.820 --> 25:13.945
Is something wrong?

25:14.387 --> 25:17.444
You have to improve your nutrition
and take vitamins.

25:17.886 --> 25:21.546
You're eating for two now.
Come back next week.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.811
- Thanks, Janet.
- My pleasure.

25:26.253 --> 25:28.242
- Susie.
- What?

25:28.420 --> 25:30.886
- Look at her.
- I'm looking.

25:31.054 --> 25:34.451
I told you I was gonna have a girl.
I'm gonna name her Susan.

25:38.921 --> 25:40.285
She's mine.

25:41.455 --> 25:43.717
She's my baby, Susie.

25:44.821 --> 25:45.810
Mine.

25:56.521 --> 25:59.510
- Carol?
- I won't type your requisition forms.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.779
- Where's Doug?
- Getting his head shrunk.

26:01.955 --> 26:03.944
- When will he be back?
- Half hour. Why?

26:04.122 --> 26:08.214
We've got the MRI on that kid.
Tell Doug to meet me in Radiology.

26:16.255 --> 26:19.244
- What do we do? Stare at inkblots?
- God, no.

26:19.422 --> 26:22.048
I don't know a thing about them.
Sit down, will you?

26:25.156 --> 26:29.713
You slugged a guy in the ER.
That was dumb.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.419
- What?
- That was really stupid.

26:34.490 --> 26:38.320
- You're a shrink. What about my neurosis?
- I know all about it.

26:38.490 --> 26:41.923
You're a reasonably normal guy
with slopp y impulse control.

26:42.557 --> 26:46.182
- That's what it's called?
- Yeah. Take my advice.

26:46.356 --> 26:50.413
If you want to lose your temper,
go pop a guy in a bar.

26:53.623 --> 26:57.851
- Are you suggesting I hit someone?
- Just don't do it at work.

26:58.024 --> 27:00.513
Or they'll fire your ass.

27:00.690 --> 27:03.316
My report will say you had a bad week.
You're a pediatrician.

27:03.491 --> 27:06.787
Thus you're particularly sensitive
to child abuse.

27:06.957 --> 27:11.322
- Now, say you'll never do it again.
- I'll never do it again.

27:11.491 --> 27:14.151
Good. Or you could really mess up your life.

27:14.324 --> 27:15.620
Thanks for stopping by.

27:23.492 --> 27:26.390
You know, I have been
a little unhapp y lately.

27:26.559 --> 27:29.991
Join the club. Try therap y, it might help.

27:30.158 --> 27:32.784
Oh, and have a nice day.

27:40.258 --> 27:41.884
Dr. Greene?

27:42.059 --> 27:46.991
Dr. Lewis said you might
recommend me for an ER sub-I.

27:47.159 --> 27:50.989
- I thought you wanted surgery?
- I won't get it, I want to consider residency.

27:51.159 --> 27:55.148
My recommendation might not
be very helpful right now.

27:55.326 --> 27:57.258
I'd like it anyway.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.392
Sure. You bet.

28:03.226 --> 28:08.625
There's an aneurysm at the juncture
of the basilar and vertebral arteries.

28:09.626 --> 28:11.785
- How old is the kid?
- Sixteen.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.915
- You'd better find his parents quick.
- We're looking.

28:16.093 --> 28:19.548
So the aneurysm is pressing down
on the spinal tract.

28:19.726 --> 28:23.124
It can blow any minute
or it could go in a week.

28:23.294 --> 28:25.919
- Nothing like a specific diagnosis.
- Hey, Seymour.

28:26.093 --> 28:28.582
Seymour Lassally. Doug Ross.
Doug took the case in.

28:28.761 --> 28:31.955
What have we got?
I have an astrocytoma at four.

28:32.127 --> 28:36.254
- That's huge! When did paralysis start?
- Yesterday.

28:36.627 --> 28:40.719
- We can't do this, Peter.
- He could die in 20 minutes.

28:40.894 --> 28:43.486
The operation requires hypothermia.

28:43.661 --> 28:47.718
You have to cool him down
so the brain will survive.

28:47.894 --> 28:51.054
Get lucky and he'll be okay,
but he's not for us.

28:51.228 --> 28:55.558
Dyer at Mercy's done it a lot.
Get the kid over there.

28:55.728 --> 29:00.285
- You're gonna pass this up?
- Dyer is good, fast and confident.

29:00.462 --> 29:02.122
Call him.

29:06.196 --> 29:09.060
He jumped right over and bit me.

29:09.229 --> 29:12.286
Well, it's minor. You'll be fine.

29:13.095 --> 29:15.754
The neighbor said he had all his shots.

29:15.929 --> 29:18.157
Could he have rabies?

29:18.329 --> 29:22.489
There hasn't been a rabid dog
in Cook County in 20 years.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.560
- You're sure about the rabies?
- Yeah.

29:28.830 --> 29:30.455
You're sweet.

29:30.629 --> 29:33.959
I'm gonna tell all my friends to come here
in emergencies.

29:38.530 --> 29:40.689
- Any word on the parents?
- Mother's on the way.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.090
I see it's raining finally.

29:42.263 --> 29:46.195
Fifteen miles? Where's he doing it?
Yeah, thanks.

29:46.363 --> 29:49.693
- Carter, give me your car keys.
- Aren't you on call?

29:49.864 --> 29:53.193
They won't take the aneurysm
without Dyer's approval.

29:53.363 --> 29:55.591
He's out jogging. Come on, your keys.

29:57.430 --> 30:00.363
GSW to the chest coming in.

30:00.530 --> 30:03.655
- What's Benton doing?
- Looking for Dr. Dyer.

30:03.831 --> 30:08.025
- He can't make his mother better.
- You took too many psych classes.

30:08.198 --> 30:10.426
Get somebody from Surgery down here
to cover for Benton.

30:10.598 --> 30:12.961
- Don't you have to leave?
- In 20 minutes.

30:13.131 --> 30:17.086
I think the woman with the dog bite
was hitting on me.

30:17.264 --> 30:19.026
- It happens.
- Not to me.

30:19.198 --> 30:21.664
- Did she smile a lot? Play with her hair?
- Yes.

30:21.832 --> 30:23.320
- Touch you?
- On my arm.

30:23.498 --> 30:27.192
- She was hitting on you.
- Hope I'm not sending out a signal.

30:27.365 --> 30:31.626
- You know, me and Jen...
- Women love to save moody men.

30:31.798 --> 30:34.663
Mark, GSW to the chest.

30:37.466 --> 30:39.455
Call Radiology. Stat!

30:40.499 --> 30:43.556
Why don't you intubate?
I'll check his lungs.

30:43.732 --> 30:48.097
- Lost 500cc's at the scene.
- BP 50 palp. Pulse 140.

30:48.265 --> 30:52.698
All right, let's go on my count.
One, two, three.

30:52.866 --> 30:55.230
All right, let's roll him.

30:55.400 --> 31:01.594
Entry wound, upper-left chest.
Exit below scapula.

31:01.766 --> 31:05.790
Second entry wound abdomen,
exit left flank.

31:05.966 --> 31:09.057
- Let him die.
- Who's she?

31:09.233 --> 31:14.359
- Get her out of here.
- Start a chest tube. Get a surgeon.

31:14.733 --> 31:17.131
I'm his mother. Let him die.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.595
- You have to wait outside.
- Let him die.

31:20.900 --> 31:22.991
Somebody get her to the waiting room.

31:23.700 --> 31:24.961
He's in fib.

31:25.134 --> 31:27.225
Paddles, 200!

31:27.401 --> 31:29.060
Charging!

31:30.067 --> 31:31.930
- Clear?
- Clear.

31:32.835 --> 31:35.357
- 300!
- He's still in fib. Hit it!

31:35.534 --> 31:37.727
- Charging.
- Clear.

31:39.935 --> 31:43.060
He's back. 100 mgs lidocaine, IV push.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.962
Tension pneumo. Sixteen-gauge needle.

31:52.602 --> 31:55.829
- Got it. Chest tube.
- Mark, you want to make that train?

31:56.368 --> 31:59.357
- I gotta put in a chest tube.
- I'll help Susan. You go.

31:59.702 --> 32:03.293
- All right, thanks.
- Seven and a half gloves.

32:04.069 --> 32:05.625
Grey pin, please.

32:05.802 --> 32:08.734
- Lidocaine?
- Don't need it.

32:10.368 --> 32:12.664
He killed two boys today.

32:13.069 --> 32:15.058
Another last month.

32:15.635 --> 32:17.828
You did no good for anybody.

32:28.536 --> 32:31.525
Murphy found you charming.
You must've turned it on.

32:31.703 --> 32:36.159
- I don't turn it on, it's just there.
- Like a force of nature.

32:36.937 --> 32:40.835
- This Little League thing...
- It's great, isn't it?

32:41.003 --> 32:43.901
Now what did I do?
Was I supposed to say no?

32:44.736 --> 32:49.294
- Jake really likes you. I'm glad.
- And...?

32:50.771 --> 32:55.567
And if you're not serious, I can handle it.
I don't expect men to stay forever.

32:55.737 --> 32:59.965
- Especially you with your history.
- Me? Mr. Commitment?

33:00.138 --> 33:02.365
But if you're going to leave Jake...

33:04.871 --> 33:08.099
I need to know, Doug.
Not for me, but for Jake.

33:08.637 --> 33:12.229
- What's our future?
- Six months at least.

33:12.804 --> 33:15.669
I hope we're together a long time.

33:15.838 --> 33:19.236
Maybe grow old together.

33:22.171 --> 33:24.763
- Maybe.
- I hope.

33:27.039 --> 33:30.835
- Can I make the station in 38 minutes?
- Mark, it'll be okay.

33:31.005 --> 33:33.766
This will be the night that Amtrak
goes on strike.

33:33.939 --> 33:36.462
Watch Garrison in Four, hypocalcemia.

33:36.638 --> 33:40.537
The girl in Three, orbital fracture,
try and get a consult.

33:40.706 --> 33:43.604
Back pain in Six could be a herniated...

33:44.072 --> 33:45.163
I can read the board.

33:48.072 --> 33:49.061
Bye.

34:04.607 --> 34:09.539
- You're Benton's student, aren't you?
- Yeah. John Carter.

34:09.706 --> 34:13.139
- Where is he?
- I think he's in surgery.

34:15.639 --> 34:19.538
I need his charts. Joint Commission
is breathing down my neck.

34:20.007 --> 34:23.666
- I want them the second he gets back.
- I'll tell him.

34:27.574 --> 34:30.063
- Is Dr. Benton back yet?
- No, still out in the rain.

34:30.241 --> 34:31.502
Probably smashed your Jeep.

34:31.675 --> 34:34.539
- Can you get his charts for me?
- You really want that sub-I.

34:34.708 --> 34:37.196
Just get them for me, Jerry.

35:12.943 --> 35:14.431
Are you Mike Dyer?

35:14.609 --> 35:18.007
- Who the hell are you?
- Peter Benton from County General.

35:18.176 --> 35:20.165
I have an MRI I want you to look at.

35:20.709 --> 35:23.039
- You're joking.
- It's in the car.

35:32.910 --> 35:37.808
- What's the code for ketoacidosis?
- 250. 11.

35:37.977 --> 35:42.636
- Facial laceration repair?
- 120.52. Why are you doing that?

35:42.810 --> 35:45.708
Round up residents. You never see this.
Woman hit by lightning.

35:45.877 --> 35:49.139
- Dr. Benton's charts are done.
- Later. Come on.

35:49.311 --> 35:54.834
Nesbitt, Leslie. Struck by side-flash
lightning on 23rd Street.

35:55.010 --> 35:58.943
Full arrest on scene.
Bystanders started CPR in seconds.

35:59.110 --> 36:03.270
- What's she had?
- Two amps epi, 2 mgs atropine.

36:03.444 --> 36:05.876
Look at this, Carter. Feathering burns.

36:06.045 --> 36:09.102
- Lichtenberg's flowers.
- Yes! Very good.

36:09.278 --> 36:14.108
- She's cyanotic. Hyperventilate her.
- I'll bag her.

36:14.978 --> 36:18.001
- Handle it, Carter.
- Move her on my count.

36:18.178 --> 36:20.803
One, two, three.

36:21.978 --> 36:25.672
- Asystole. How long since last epi?
- Seven minutes.

36:28.012 --> 36:30.671
- All right, Carter.
- Give a high dose, 5 mgs.

36:30.846 --> 36:34.108
- CBC, Chem-24, cardiac enzymes.
- Pupils fixed and dilated.

36:34.279 --> 36:38.439
- Doesn't matter, you get that with lightning.
- Where's everybody? They should see this.

36:38.612 --> 36:40.908
- I got a weak pulse.
- Sinus rhythm.

36:42.513 --> 36:44.808
Dopamine 400 mgs in 500 D5W.

36:44.979 --> 36:49.435
Let's get a cross-table C-spine,
a chest and a head CT, non-contrast.

36:49.979 --> 36:51.946
- Well done.
- Good teachers.

36:52.112 --> 36:55.101
- Who?
- Dr. Benton, Dr. Greene, Dr. Lewis.

36:55.279 --> 36:57.905
- Which one's the best?
- They're all good.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.205
Diplomacy too.
What do we do with this patient?

37:00.379 --> 37:03.573
If the x-rays are okay we get the CT
and ship her to the ICU?

37:03.746 --> 37:04.939
Yes.

37:05.481 --> 37:07.106
Shooting!

37:08.913 --> 37:11.038
Your mother is on her way.

37:11.214 --> 37:13.271
- What did she say?
- I didn't talk to her.

37:13.447 --> 37:18.141
Since she and my dad have
been divorced she works and all.

37:18.314 --> 37:20.337
She's gonna be worried.

37:23.814 --> 37:26.246
I don't just have the flu, right?

37:28.181 --> 37:29.441
No.

37:32.781 --> 37:34.679
You have an aneurysm.

37:35.415 --> 37:38.176
It's like a little balloon in a blood vessel
in your brain.

37:38.914 --> 37:40.880
Doesn't sound good.

37:41.615 --> 37:43.240
It's not.

37:45.081 --> 37:49.173
- Why am I going to another hospital?
- It's a complicated operation.

37:49.348 --> 37:50.746
Complicated?

37:51.815 --> 37:52.906
Like I could die?

37:55.149 --> 37:57.637
Yeah, you could die.

37:59.483 --> 38:01.210
But that's not gonna happen.

38:11.282 --> 38:15.045
- I'm going over there alone?
- Don't worry, you'll be in good hands.

38:15.449 --> 38:17.210
- All right?
- All right.

38:44.951 --> 38:46.507
Dr. Benton.

38:47.184 --> 38:49.013
Your charts look good. Thank you.

38:50.251 --> 38:52.444
This student of yours is terrific.

38:53.051 --> 38:58.006
- So you found the neurosurgeon?
- Yeah. Oh, car keys.

38:58.851 --> 39:02.841
- My charts?
- He wanted them so I finished them.

39:04.685 --> 39:07.651
- Yeah, well, thank you.
- Excuse me?

39:07.818 --> 39:10.807
- I said thank you.
- I know.

39:10.985 --> 39:14.349
- I just wanted to hear you say it twice.
- I'll see you in the morning.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.746
- What happened to you?
- I had to run an errand.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.418
Still interested in dinner?

39:26.586 --> 39:29.949
Is this cool, or what?

39:30.452 --> 39:33.111
Does she really need six pairs to start?

39:33.285 --> 39:35.081
Aren't these cute?

39:35.652 --> 39:38.641
These are nice. Maybe we can
take some of the others back.

39:38.819 --> 39:41.876
Forget the bows.
Keep the patent leather.

39:42.619 --> 39:44.449
How much did you put on my credit card?

39:45.853 --> 39:49.910
- A hundred, maybe 150.
- This is easily 300.

39:54.453 --> 39:55.441
Suz.

39:59.153 --> 40:01.346
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

40:03.954 --> 40:08.046
- Lf Mom can do it, you can.
- At least I didn't drink sangria all day.

40:08.221 --> 40:11.119
Or smoke four packs of Luckys.

40:11.354 --> 40:12.785
And we turned out okay.

40:13.154 --> 40:14.915
And Mom didn't have you to help her.

40:17.887 --> 40:21.012
It's gonna be all right, isn't it?

40:22.354 --> 40:24.684
Yes, it's gonna be fine.

40:26.021 --> 40:28.714
Three plus three is six.

40:29.387 --> 40:32.649
And four plus four is eight.

40:33.621 --> 40:35.917
And six...

40:36.422 --> 40:38.411
Daddy, I don't have any more fingers.

40:38.588 --> 40:43.816
- Well, I do. Hold up six.
- Hey, Bananafish, it's time for bed.

40:44.088 --> 40:45.748
But Daddy's here.

40:46.322 --> 40:50.220
Daddy can't stop you from falling asleep
in school tomorrow.

40:50.388 --> 40:54.582
- Go brush your teeth.
- Lf I get a story.

40:55.255 --> 40:58.915
Well, Daddy will read you a story.

40:59.589 --> 41:01.078
Go brush your teeth.

41:01.256 --> 41:02.516
Go.

41:06.423 --> 41:07.752
Jen.

41:09.289 --> 41:11.482
It's been a long day, Mark.

41:11.822 --> 41:14.380
Should I turn around and go back?

41:16.256 --> 41:18.814
I just... I can't do this.

41:18.990 --> 41:21.455
We need to talk about Rachel.

41:21.723 --> 41:22.746
I miss her.

41:24.790 --> 41:26.779
I need to see her more.

41:31.324 --> 41:33.415
You live two hours away.

41:33.591 --> 41:34.783
I'll move up here.

41:36.990 --> 41:39.888
Mark, it's over.

41:40.057 --> 41:42.819
No, I mean, I'll get a place here.

41:42.990 --> 41:44.616
I'll commute.

41:45.190 --> 41:47.656
I want to raise my daughter.

41:48.624 --> 41:53.080
- You'll commute?
- I'm not gonna get that attending job.

41:53.791 --> 41:56.280
I'll try and find a job here.

41:56.657 --> 41:58.146
If that's what you want to do.

42:00.325 --> 42:01.688
Look...

42:01.858 --> 42:05.313
Can I stay here next week
while I'm looking for a place?

42:06.258 --> 42:07.985
It's not a good idea.

42:10.959 --> 42:13.823
Can I stay here tonight on the couch?

42:14.592 --> 42:18.081
- Daddy, aren't you coming?
- I'll be there in a sec.

42:22.792 --> 42:23.780
Please.

42:25.725 --> 42:27.453
Okay. Okay.

42:28.226 --> 42:30.158
- Thanks.
- Daddy?

42:33.426 --> 42:35.654
Why don't you go read to Rachel?

42:54.327 --> 42:58.817
So she stood up and she started to applaud.

42:59.427 --> 43:03.450
- In the middle of graduation?
- The whole medical school was staring.

43:04.794 --> 43:08.191
When I graduated from college,
my father danced.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.952
- What's wrong with that?
- On a table.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.425
I hope my kids don't sit around
laughing at me.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.220
Better than hating us.

43:19.161 --> 43:22.820
- You don't hate your mother.
- Yours is great. It doesn't mean mine was.

43:29.695 --> 43:30.922
So...

43:33.628 --> 43:36.423
She's never gonna get any better, is she?

43:36.761 --> 43:38.318
There won't be much improvement.

43:39.828 --> 43:43.817
- And there's not a damn thing I can do.
- No.

43:49.862 --> 43:50.919
I...

43:56.162 --> 43:58.685
I wouldn't be getting through this thing...

43:59.963 --> 44:01.258
...if it wasn't for you.

44:13.096 --> 44:16.392
I think Peter Benton can get through
just about anything.

44:23.530 --> 44:24.962
He used to think so.
