09:41.581 --> 09:44.250

<i>and put some of these guys on ice.</i>

35:18.449 --> 35:21.119
<i>My intel is Rafael Aguilar</i>
<i>calling shots in Juárez.</i>

35:21.202 --> 35:24.455
<i>-He's the brains down there.</i>
<i>-Yeah, well…</i>

35:25.498 --> 35:26.707
<i>I heard different.</i>

35:26.791 --> 35:29.836
<i>If Carrillo's the man, why'd he just</i>
<i>spend three months in lockup?</i>

35:31.921 --> 35:35.591
<i>My buddy in customs heard Carrillo</i>
<i>was picked up by a fucking army patrol.</i>

35:36.175 --> 35:38.177
<i>Don't feel like a "boss" look to me.</i>

35:39.428 --> 35:40.596
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

35:40.680 --> 35:42.849
<i>If you have any questions,</i>
<i>you let me know.</i>

35:47.562 --> 35:48.896
<i>[drill whirring]</i>

35:51.149 --> 35:52.859
<i>[in Spanish] Doesn't look</i>
<i>how I pictured it.</i>

35:57.655 --> 35:58.698
<i>[car honks]</i>

36:00.408 --> 36:01.409
<i>[Rafael] Let's go, man.</i>

36:01.492 --> 36:04.162
<i>Can't keep</i>
<i>this fancy prick waiting, right?</i>

36:13.504 --> 36:14.547
<i>Look at this place.</i>

36:15.423 --> 36:17.091
<i>Fucking Roman castle!</i>

36:18.134 --> 36:19.135
<i>What else could you want?</i>

36:29.729 --> 36:31.981
<i>Now let's make this place look nice!</i>

36:37.820 --> 36:40.031
<i>[Rafael] Heard you went back to Sinaloa.</i>

36:41.324 --> 36:42.408
<i>Family stuff.</i>

36:49.790 --> 36:51.667
<i>I was born a couple miles from here.</i>

36:53.419 --> 36:54.921
<i>Place just like that.</i>

36:56.756 --> 36:58.216
<i>Fuck that.</i>

36:59.091 --> 37:00.343
<i>Look at me now.</i>

37:00.426 --> 37:01.761
<i>Hmm? [laughs]</i>

37:04.263 --> 37:06.724
<i>Check out this motherfucker.</i>

37:06.807 --> 37:08.434
<i>[tense music playing]</i>

37:11.604 --> 37:14.649
<i>[Andréa in English] </i>When people ask me
what's wrong with Mexico,

37:14.732 --> 37:16.317
<i>this is the face I see.</i>

37:16.400 --> 37:19.654
<i>Carlos Hank Gonzalez</i>
<i>was known as </i>El Profesor.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.323
<i>He started life as a rural school teacher</i>

37:22.406 --> 37:24.700
<i>selling candy</i>
<i>on the side to make ends meet.</i>

37:25.451 --> 37:27.370
<i>He didn't stay poor for long.</i>

37:27.453 --> 37:29.288
<i>The PRI ran Mexico,</i>

37:29.872 --> 37:33.084
<i>and Hank had a gift</i>
<i>for cutting deals and trading favors.</i>

37:33.167 --> 37:35.920
<i>He moved through</i>
<i>party ranks like a freight train,</i>

37:36.003 --> 37:40.424
<i>serving as mayor of Mexico City,</i>
<i>governor, cabinet secretary.</i>

37:41.217 --> 37:43.719
<i>But somehow, Hank found time</i>

37:43.803 --> 37:46.055
<i>to start a banking</i>
<i>and transportation empire.</i>

37:46.889 --> 37:49.225
<i>You'd think a career politician</i>
<i>amassing a fortune</i>

37:49.308 --> 37:53.646
<i>worth hundreds of millions</i>
<i>might raise some awkward questions.</i>

37:53.729 --> 37:55.731
<i>[in Spanish] A politician who is poor…</i>

37:55.815 --> 37:57.483
<i>is a poor politician.</i>

37:57.566 --> 38:01.821
<i>[Andréa in English] </i>He really said that.
Gotta admit, it's a good line.

38:03.572 --> 38:08.369
<i>For decades, he guided the PRI,</i>
<i>shaping every decision the party made.</i>

38:09.620 --> 38:12.456
<i>Presidents came and went, but Hank stayed.</i>

38:13.249 --> 38:16.085
<i>The embodiment</i>
<i>of institutional corruption.</i>

38:16.961 --> 38:20.464
<i>He got all the perks</i>
<i>and none of the bullshit.</i>

38:22.883 --> 38:28.806
<i>The president got the pretty sash,</i>
<i>but Carlos Hank had the power.</i>

38:28.889 --> 38:33.102
<i>[Carlos in Spanish] My business group</i>
<i>is making some purchases in Juárez.</i>

38:33.185 --> 38:35.521
<i>You own several lots of land</i>
<i>we're interested in.</i>

38:36.689 --> 38:41.402
<i>They haven't been developed,</i>
<i>but we'll still pay a fair price.</i>

38:44.363 --> 38:45.948
<i>[Rafael sighs]</i>

38:47.158 --> 38:48.576
<i>We'd like to help you out,</i>

38:49.994 --> 38:55.249
<i>but we have big plans for that land.</i>

38:55.833 --> 38:57.209
<i>[Carlos] Really?</i>

38:57.293 --> 39:02.840
<i>So far, those "big plans"</i>
<i>have amounted to a slum</i>

39:02.923 --> 39:07.553
<i>and a chicken processing plant.</i>
<i>[clicks tongue and chuckles]</i>

39:08.596 --> 39:11.432
<i>The Hank Group is expanding into Juárez.</i>

39:12.933 --> 39:14.769
<i>We're "moving into the neighborhood."</i>

39:15.561 --> 39:19.940
<i>I know you two control</i>
<i>certain local commercial interests.</i>

39:20.858 --> 39:23.736
<i>Going forward, I expect</i>
<i>that business will be done discretely.</i>

39:24.528 --> 39:28.366
<i>Any complications</i>
<i>to my interests are unacceptable.</i>

39:31.994 --> 39:33.704
<i>[chuckles]</i>

39:36.082 --> 39:39.293
<i>Thank you, chief!</i>
<i>You've got the coldest beer in Juárez.</i>

39:42.004 --> 39:43.381
<i>Gentlemen…</i>

39:43.464 --> 39:45.216
<i>Come up with a price for that land.</i>

39:55.351 --> 39:56.977
<i>You ever gonna say anything?</i>

40:02.233 --> 40:06.278
<i>Should put an "asshole tax"</i>
<i>on that land he wants.</i>

40:07.405 --> 40:11.200
<i>Maybe the fancy prick</i>
<i>moves our stuff north…</i>

40:12.827 --> 40:14.829
<i>on all those trains and shit he owns.</i>

40:16.831 --> 40:20.543
<i>Our business isn't big enough</i>
<i>to make it worth his time.</i>

40:20.626 --> 40:23.921
<i>-The margins aren't there.</i>
<i>-Ah.</i>

40:25.548 --> 40:29.468
<i>He's buying into NAFTA.</i>
<i>What it's gonna do to this border…</i>

40:30.636 --> 40:32.680
<i>Shit's not even a real thing yet.</i>

40:34.640 --> 40:37.935
<i>If he's moving in, it will be.</i>

40:38.018 --> 40:40.563
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

40:50.906 --> 40:52.158
<i>[Walt in English] Approaching now.</i>

41:00.332 --> 41:01.167
<i>I see him.</i>

41:06.338 --> 41:08.466
<i>All right, boys. Here we go.</i>

41:13.971 --> 41:14.972
<i>What's up, man?</i>

41:16.098 --> 41:16.932
<i>[Mike] What's up, man?</i>

41:17.558 --> 41:19.351
<i>-Ready to do this, brother?</i>
<i>-[Walt] I am.</i>

41:20.728 --> 41:22.480
<i>-[Mike] </i>Bring your CDL?
<i>-[Walt] </i>Sure did.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.608
<i>[Mike] </i>Sit tight. I'll grab the boss.

41:32.448 --> 41:35.493
<i>[Walt] Two by the garage.</i>
<i>No weapons visible.</i>

41:44.835 --> 41:46.003
<i>Right on time.</i>

41:47.046 --> 41:49.006
<i>Fucker's practically scraping the ground.</i>

41:52.760 --> 41:53.594
<i>[Mike] </i>Chris!

41:57.848 --> 42:01.852
<i>This is my buddy, Chris. Solid dude.</i>
<i>He's looking to put in some work.</i>

42:02.603 --> 42:06.065
<i>-Mike says you drive long haul.</i>
<i>-Off and on for about ten years.</i>

42:06.148 --> 42:08.150
<i>-[man] Got a clean sheet?</i>
<i>-I do. Spotless.</i>

42:08.234 --> 42:11.779
<i>-[man] What kind of rig?</i>
<i>-Kenworths, mostly. Anteaters.</i>

42:11.862 --> 42:13.656
<i>We move our shit with legit loads.</i>

42:13.739 --> 42:15.908
<i>Real bills of lading.</i>
<i>Helps if you get pulled over.</i>

42:16.408 --> 42:17.409
<i>I don't get pulled over.</i>

42:17.493 --> 42:21.664
<i>We pack the cargo. You don't open the back</i>
<i>until you get to the destination, ever.</i>

42:22.289 --> 42:23.165
<i>Understood.</i>

42:27.753 --> 42:31.382
<i>Mike says you're cool.</i>
<i>Let's see how you do. Don't fuck up.</i>

42:32.091 --> 42:35.344
<i>[Walt] </i>After a couple of runs,
I might take that LeBaron off your hands.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.471
<i>-[man] </i>Make me an offer.
<i>-[Walt] </i>All right.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.099
<i>All right.</i>

42:41.183 --> 42:42.476
<i>God damn it.</i>

42:54.196 --> 42:55.197
<i>[man] Want one, man?</i>

43:04.999 --> 43:05.916
<i>Nah.</i>

43:06.000 --> 43:07.751
<i>My old lady's on me to quit.</i>

43:10.462 --> 43:14.091
<i>-[man] Need to make a copy of your CDL.</i>
<i>-[Walt] Yeah. Sure thing.</i>

43:26.645 --> 43:27.605
<i>[Mike] You good, bro?</i>

43:28.480 --> 43:29.481
<i>Gotta pay the water bill.</i>

43:29.565 --> 43:31.650
<i>Some place around here</i>
<i>I could hit the head?</i>

43:31.734 --> 43:32.943
<i>Right there.</i>

43:41.660 --> 43:43.704
<i>What the fuck? Are we going in?</i>

43:44.872 --> 43:48.292
<i>10-22. 10-22. Do not break position.</i>

43:48.375 --> 43:52.963
<i>Two white vans headed south on Alameda.</i>
<i>Texas plates. Tail 'em.</i>

43:53.922 --> 43:57.134
<i>10-22. Hold positions.</i>
<i>I repeat, hold your position.</i>

43:57.801 --> 44:01.639
<i>Two white vans, Texas plates,</i>
<i>headed south on Alameda. Get on them, now.</i>

44:01.722 --> 44:03.349
<i>[tense music playing]</i>

44:18.447 --> 44:20.282
<i>-Everything cool?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

44:22.826 --> 44:24.703
<i>Bad boy's gotta be moved around back.</i>

44:26.288 --> 44:27.915
<i>Keys are inside. Go for it, man.</i>

44:30.125 --> 44:31.377
<i>Stand by to go in.</i>

44:33.087 --> 44:35.214
<i>-Can he drive that thing?</i>
<i>-You kidding me? Fuck no.</i>

44:36.924 --> 44:38.926
<i>Be ready to roll. Stand by.</i>

44:40.594 --> 44:42.221
<i>[Walt] </i>What is this? A driving test?

44:42.304 --> 44:45.891
<i>You'll be spending a lot of time in there.</i>
<i>Might as well get used to it.</i>

45:16.588 --> 45:17.631
<i>You okay, man?</i>

45:21.427 --> 45:24.805
<i>Man, I can't lie to you. I fucked up.</i>

45:26.098 --> 45:27.808
<i>Last night, I was nervous.</i>

45:29.476 --> 45:31.770
<i>I really wanted today to go smooth and…</i>

45:34.022 --> 45:36.024
<i>had that rat running around in my skull,</i>

45:37.443 --> 45:38.318
<i>and I slipped.</i>

45:39.236 --> 45:40.446
<i>I had a drink.</i>

45:44.408 --> 45:46.201
<i>Shit, man. I'm sorry.</i>

45:48.954 --> 45:50.748
<i>Hey, this too shall pass.</i>

45:51.707 --> 45:53.292
<i>Tomorrow's another day, right?</i>

45:56.962 --> 45:59.840
<i>But right now, I need you</i>
<i>to move this fucking rig, Chris.</i>

46:02.050 --> 46:04.344
<i>You said you drove a Kenworth T600, right?</i>

46:05.262 --> 46:06.889
<i>The one with the set-back front axle?</i>

46:14.313 --> 46:15.898
<i>Hey, Fernie, come here, will you?</i>

46:20.194 --> 46:21.945
<i>Come on. God damn it!</i>

46:25.949 --> 46:27.326
<i>What the fuck's going on, man?</i>

46:32.873 --> 46:34.625
<i>I got this. Hold your positions.</i>

46:34.708 --> 46:36.251
<i>Who the fuck are you talking to?</i>

46:36.335 --> 46:38.587
<i>I repeat, hold your positions.</i>

46:39.755 --> 46:42.758
<i>Everyone hold tight. Do not move.</i>

46:43.467 --> 46:45.010
<i>[Mike] </i>You trying to catch
a fucking bullet?

46:49.640 --> 46:52.726
<i>-Listen, Mike, I need you to calm down.</i>
<i>-Fuck you.</i>

46:52.810 --> 46:54.770
<i>Mike, I'm a DEA agent.</i>

46:57.105 --> 46:58.565
<i>Are you trying to get me killed?</i>

46:58.649 --> 47:01.568
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to shut the fuck up and calm down.</i>

47:01.652 --> 47:02.945
<i>Calm down? Fuck that.</i>

47:03.028 --> 47:04.571
<i>I got a Glock 9 service weapon.</i>

47:04.655 --> 47:05.823
<i>If you don't get it together,</i>

47:05.906 --> 47:08.283
<i>I'll pull it out and shoot you</i>
<i>in the head right here.</i>

47:08.367 --> 47:10.619
<i>I'll shoot you</i>
<i>square in the fucking face, Mike.</i>

47:16.333 --> 47:18.502
<i>Hey, man. [clears throat]</i>

47:20.170 --> 47:21.964
<i>-Thanks, man.</i>
<i>-Everything okay?</i>

47:22.047 --> 47:26.093
<i>Yeah. We were just checking out the rig,</i>
<i>man. It's pretty sweet.</i>

47:26.176 --> 47:27.678
<i>Yeah, it's all good.</i>

47:29.137 --> 47:31.390
<i>How about Thursday at 9:00?</i>
<i>Get you started.</i>

47:31.473 --> 47:32.432
<i>Sounds good.</i>

47:34.810 --> 47:37.437
<i>-Mike, you still catching a ride with me?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

47:43.151 --> 47:44.278
<i>[siren wails]</i>

47:45.612 --> 47:47.447
<i>[Walt] </i>Those vans were carrying cash.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.533
<i>But you never actually saw the money?</i>

47:50.158 --> 47:52.536
<i>Both vans had a gunslinger riding shotgun.</i>

47:53.245 --> 47:54.788
<i>Security, that means cash.</i>

47:55.581 --> 47:58.292
<i>We know the Nissans</i>
<i>come north, riding heavy with coke.</i>

47:58.876 --> 48:01.253
<i>Both those vans were loaded up</i>
<i>and on their way out.</i>

48:01.336 --> 48:04.131
<i>What? They're shipping coke</i>
<i>back to Mexico now?</i>

48:04.214 --> 48:07.384
<i>You sure those vans are headed</i>
<i>to the other side of the river?</i>

48:07.467 --> 48:09.595
<i>If they are,</i>
<i>it's 'cause they're moving money.</i>

48:13.223 --> 48:14.683
<i>[Mills over radio] </i>Come in, Jaime.

48:15.976 --> 48:17.102
<i>Yeah, go ahead, Mills.</i>

48:17.728 --> 48:19.146
<i>Yeah, I tailed them to the border.</i>

48:19.229 --> 48:21.315
<i>Lost both vans</i>
<i>once they crossed into Juárez.</i>

48:21.398 --> 48:23.734
<i>Son of a bitch. Copy, Mills. Thank you.</i>

48:25.027 --> 48:26.987
<i>Look, coke comes and goes every day,</i>

48:27.070 --> 48:29.072
<i>but when do we ever put</i>
<i>our eyes on the money?</i>

48:29.156 --> 48:30.449
<i>Never.</i>

48:30.532 --> 48:33.785
<i>If Juárez has spots over here</i>
<i>holding cash, even temporarily…</i>

48:33.869 --> 48:35.162
<i>we got to play that out, sir.</i>

48:36.163 --> 48:37.998
<i>We sit on them, pin down their schedule,</i>

48:38.081 --> 48:40.000
<i>when a bunch</i>
<i>of money's on the move, we grab it.</i>

48:40.834 --> 48:43.795
<i>And when Amado and Aguilar</i>
<i>come looking for whoever took it,</i>

48:43.879 --> 48:46.131
<i>we take 'em right here in El Paso.</i>

48:52.930 --> 48:55.724
<i>Walt's right.</i>
<i>This might be a chance to damage Juárez.</i>

48:57.142 --> 48:59.269
<i>We're gonna take our time and do it right.</i>

48:59.353 --> 49:01.980
<i>Might bring the Feds in,</i>
<i>we Title III the whole damn thing.</i>

49:02.064 --> 49:03.023
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

49:03.106 --> 49:05.525
<i>Expand surveillance</i>
<i>at all the sites we've ID'd.</i>

49:05.609 --> 49:07.527
<i>I'll get the FBI on board.</i>

49:07.611 --> 49:10.364
<i>Then you and Mills,</i>
<i>you get a jump on those T3 applications.</i>

49:11.073 --> 49:12.950
<i>-Hey, give me a sec, will you?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

49:16.244 --> 49:17.287
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>

49:17.955 --> 49:19.790
<i>That's a real violation of the fellowship.</i>

49:20.707 --> 49:24.002
<i>Well, there's programs in prison.</i>
<i>I hope you stick with it.</i>

49:24.920 --> 49:25.921
<i>Fuck you, man.</i>

49:31.510 --> 49:34.054
<i>-He didn't take that so well.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

49:37.015 --> 49:38.058
<i>[Amado] Hey…</i>

49:39.184 --> 49:40.102
<i>[in Spanish] It's me.</i>

49:40.852 --> 49:42.020
<i>[Marisol] </i>What is it, Amado?

49:43.230 --> 49:44.147
<i>Um…</i>

49:46.274 --> 49:49.903
<i>I was thinking about what you said.</i>

49:51.405 --> 49:53.782
<i>You were right.</i>

49:56.493 --> 49:58.620
<i>I never chose.</i>

49:59.746 --> 50:03.583
<i>It wasn't about you,</i>
<i>or Anna. It's just, I…</i>

50:05.293 --> 50:09.172
<i>[sighs] Fuck, how do I explain?</i>

50:09.256 --> 50:12.092
<i>I've always stood</i>
<i>on the outside of things.</i>

50:13.677 --> 50:15.137
<i>I know that.</i>

50:15.887 --> 50:17.681
<i>I was married to you, Amado.</i>

50:19.725 --> 50:21.560
<i>Look, I should go…</i>

<i>Fuck. Look who's here! [laughs]</i>

51:33.423 --> 51:37.344
<i>Hey, don't let this dude's</i>

51:38.428 --> 51:40.263
<i>[woman gasping and exclaiming]</i>

51:48.313 --> 51:49.773
<i>[breathing heavily]</i>

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

52:56.673 --> 52:58.717
<i>You decide who gets to be president.</i>

52:58.800 --> 53:01.803
<i>So why are your men blocking my plane?</i>

53:01.887 --> 53:04.347
<i>No, no. I just wanted to make sure</i>

53:04.431 --> 53:07.642
<i>you got the deeds</i>

53:08.476 --> 53:09.311

<i>I want another conversation,</i>

53:28.538 --> 53:31.291
<i>once I'm ready to make you</i>
<i>a business proposal.</i>

53:32.125 --> 53:33.335
<i>No offense…</i>

53:34.336 --> 53:38.798

<i>The racetrack you own in Tijuana</i>

53:43.803 --> 53:46.514
<i>launders millions</i>

<i>Where's your partner?</i>

53:55.649 --> 53:58.485
<i>He's gone. It's just me now.</i>

<i>Difference of opinion?</i>

54:00.195 --> 54:02.489
<i>[Amado] Of method. And vision.</i>

54:05.116 --> 54:07.160
<i>I know what happens to this place</i>

54:07.244 --> 54:10.747
<i>when the trade deal you made</i>
<i>with the Americans goes into effect.</i>

54:12.249 --> 54:16.586
<i>I know what this border can be,</i>
<i>and so do you.</i>

54:20.131 --> 54:22.008

<i>We both know who did it.</i>

55:16.980 --> 55:17.981
<i>Yeah.</i>

55:18.690 --> 55:19.983
<i>Amado made his move.</i>

55:20.567 --> 55:23.320

55:24.362 --> 55:25.322
<i>Fuck!</i>

55:27.574 --> 55:30.535
<i>-I'll see you tomorrow, sir.</i>
-Good work. See you then.

55:48.595 --> 55:51.639
<i>I did talk about my brother</i>
<i>the other night at that meeting.</i>

55:53.850 --> 55:55.268
<i>I told his story.</i>

55:56.936 --> 55:58.396
<i>Or at least I tried to.</i>

56:00.523 --> 56:01.441
<i>I'm glad.</i>

56:03.985 --> 56:05.403
<i>You should do it more.</i>

56:08.323 --> 56:11.409
<i>Not just when you're undercover</i>
<i>at an AA meeting.</i>

56:13.703 --> 56:15.121

<i>Have you seen her or not?</i>

56:37.977 --> 56:39.229
<i>[sighs]</i>

56:49.906 --> 56:51.741
<i>Doesn't look familiar.</i>

56:53.159 --> 56:58.164
<i>Let's check the others to make sure.</i>
<i>You came all this way, right?</i>

57:00.333 --> 57:04.379
<i>Power went out</i>
<i>in both refrigeration units last week…</i>

57:04.462 --> 57:06.214
<i>Fucking mess.</i>

<i>[romantic pop song playing in Spanish]</i>

57:40.999 --> 57:42.375
<i>[Victor] They were murdered?</i>

57:42.959 --> 57:44.127
<i>Yeah, probably.</i>

57:45.545 --> 57:46.379
<i>Who were they?</i>

57:46.963 --> 57:48.339
<i>No ID.</i>

57:49.007 --> 57:50.592
<i>Whores, probably.</i>

<i>Call me if she shows up.</i>

58:03.313 --> 58:04.355
<i>Sure thing.</i>
