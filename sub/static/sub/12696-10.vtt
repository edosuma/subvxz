WEBVTT

00:07.700 --> 00:09.000
- *

00:09.100 --> 00:10.500
- All done.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.933
- Oh, I love it.

00:12.033 --> 00:14.167
- Looking good, baby!

00:16.267 --> 00:19.100
- Aw, just the girls
hangin' out?

00:19.200 --> 00:20.900
- Not exactly.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.900
- All right,
I'm ready to pedi.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.133
- Oh, Link's back.
- He never left.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.367
- Well, ever since
I quit Splatburger,

00:31.467 --> 00:33.933
I have all this extra
time for my other job--

00:34.033 --> 00:36.133
being Phoebe's boyfriend.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.133
How am I doin', boss?

00:38.233 --> 00:40.500
- Employee of the Month!

00:40.600 --> 00:42.233
- Oh, but it is late.
I should get going.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.967
You can paint my nails
next time, Chloe.

00:44.067 --> 00:47.867
- Okay. Dr. Bunny,
your turn!

00:49.467 --> 00:51.233
- I'll call you
from the car.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.200
- Uh, it's probably not safe to
call me while you're driving.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.067
- You're right.
Maybe I should stay.

00:55.167 --> 00:56.933
- No, no, no.
Call me from the car.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.633
- Okay.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.533
- Okay, is there a reason

01:07.633 --> 01:09.800
you're turning our house
into an igloo?

01:09.900 --> 01:11.467
It's Link.

01:11.567 --> 01:13.667
I love spending time with him--
just not all my time.

01:13.767 --> 01:15.367
Since we're always together,

01:15.467 --> 01:17.267
I never get
a chance to miss him.

01:19.167 --> 01:22.067
Looks like you got yourself
quite the clinger.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.100
Trust me.
I know all about that.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.333
- COLOSSO:
Max, is that you?

01:26.433 --> 01:28.900
Are you comin' down?
Should I come up?

01:29.067 --> 01:30.600
Max

01:30.700 --> 01:33.800
- Well, at least I get to
keep my clinger in a cage.

01:38.267 --> 01:40.367
- You know, Phoebe,
when your father first retired,

01:40.467 --> 01:42.500
he was a little clingy, too.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.067
Guess what I did?

01:44.167 --> 01:46.133
- Barb, thanks again
for this 3D puzzle.

01:46.233 --> 01:47.667
Just when I'm looking for
something to do,

01:47.767 --> 01:50.867
another one shows up!

01:50.967 --> 01:52.433
- You got him a hobby.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.933
- No, I got him a home gym,
but that didn't work.

01:56.633 --> 01:58.733
- Oh, I think Link wants
me to answer my phone.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.900
- I forgot to freeze
the back door.

02:05.567 --> 02:06.800
- Hey, Link.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.900
Yeah, I miss you, too.

02:09.067 --> 02:11.867
This may be awhile.

02:11.967 --> 02:14.100
- *

02:14.200 --> 02:15.367
* What you see

02:15.467 --> 02:17.067
* Is not what you get

02:17.167 --> 02:20.167
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:20.267 --> 02:21.900
* We fit right in

02:22.067 --> 02:23.367
* Bet you never guessed

02:23.467 --> 02:24.900
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:25.067 --> 02:26.467
* Just like all the rest

02:26.567 --> 02:28.267
* A picture
perfect family *

02:28.367 --> 02:30.367
* Is what we try to be

02:30.467 --> 02:31.733
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:31.833 --> 02:33.367
* The crazy things we do

02:33.467 --> 02:35.067
* This isn't
make believe *

02:35.133 --> 02:36.800
* It's our reality

02:36.900 --> 02:38.233
* Just your average family

02:38.333 --> 02:41.300
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:41.400 --> 02:45.167
* Livin' a double life

02:50.200 --> 02:52.900
- I'm so excited to go to
the movies tomorrow night.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.367
- Me, too.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.433
Any chance that this is going to
be a girls' night girls' night,

02:56.533 --> 02:58.600
or is it gonna be a girls' night
plus Link girls' night,

02:58.700 --> 03:01.600
like it's been the past
three girls' nights?

03:01.700 --> 03:03.900
- Yeah, if you're asking
if Link is coming--no.

03:04.067 --> 03:06.733
Oh, come on, that's actually
what I wanted to show you.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.133
Of course.

03:14.233 --> 03:15.900
You're gonna clean
out your garage

03:16.067 --> 03:18.133
so you have a place
to hide from Link.

03:18.233 --> 03:20.133
- No, it's National
Hobby Month.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.933
I'm gonna have Link
pick a hobby

03:22.067 --> 03:23.367
and then he'll give
me a little space--

03:23.467 --> 03:25.567
which is exactly what
our relationship needs.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.433
- Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, Cherry.

03:27.533 --> 03:30.200
Garage sale. Awesome.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.867
- No, Link, it's National
Hobby Month.

03:32.967 --> 03:35.200
Duh!

03:35.300 --> 03:39.067
Oh, I call dibs
on knitting.

03:40.433 --> 03:42.933
- Oh, yeah--did you know
that up to 500 hobbies

03:43.067 --> 03:46.567
go unhobbed each month?

03:46.667 --> 03:49.333
- I don't think
anyone knows that.

03:49.433 --> 03:51.800
- Well, now that you do,
let's get you a hobby.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.967
We have, uh,
soda brewing, ping pong,

03:55.067 --> 03:56.767
ooh, croquet.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.600
- Is spending time with you
somewhere around here--

03:58.700 --> 04:00.867
'cause that's a hobby
I could "get down" with.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.800
I can't take that
back, can I?

04:04.900 --> 04:07.500
- Hey, Phoebe, I think
your boomerang's broken.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.933
I threw it
and it's not coming back.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.900
- CHERRY: Now it is!

04:14.100 --> 04:18.067
- Oh, I am just going to
take my knitting and go.

04:18.167 --> 04:20.833
No way I can hurt
myself with these things.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.700
- Wow, you saved
Cherry's life.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.733
I wish I had skills like that.
- You do.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.733
Wait. That could be your
hobby--saving people.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.567
- You know, to be honest,

04:32.667 --> 04:34.367
it's something that
I've always wanted to do.

04:34.467 --> 04:35.900
But growing up the son
of Evil Man,

04:36.067 --> 04:37.667
I just never thought
it was possible.

04:37.767 --> 04:38.867
- Well, hey, you won't
know until you try.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.733
I can even go on
your first save with you.

04:40.833 --> 04:43.167
Make sure it's something
you can "get down" with.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.500
Yeah, there really
is no way to make that cool.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.700
- Yeah. No.

04:51.733 --> 04:54.467
- Thanks for inviting us to
hang out at Splatburger, Max.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.067
- Ah, I didn't invite
you to hang out,

04:56.100 --> 04:58.333
I invited you to pay.

04:58.433 --> 05:01.633
- Hello, Thunder brats.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.800
- Mrs. Wong, what are
you doing here?

05:03.900 --> 05:06.600
- I'm passing out
samples of my chili.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.167
The "Chili Wars" cooking show
is coming to Hiddenville

05:09.267 --> 05:11.867
and I'm in it to win it!

05:11.967 --> 05:13.500
- So, why are you
here at Splatburger?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.067
This isn't your restaurant.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.633
- It is now.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.900
Soon I will own every
restaurant in Hiddenville

05:19.067 --> 05:22.967
and you won't be able to escape
the long arm of Wong!

05:25.400 --> 05:27.900
Anyway, enjoy the chili.

05:29.100 --> 05:33.400
- Well, everything tastes
better when it's free.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.267
Except this!
- BILLY: It's gross!

05:36.367 --> 05:37.667
- I've made better
chili than this--

05:37.767 --> 05:39.533
right here at this table.

05:39.633 --> 05:41.867
Watch--uh, burrito,
fried peppers,

05:41.967 --> 05:45.267
hamburger and my secret
ingredient.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.500
- Grow up, Billy.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.567
- Sweet potato fries.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.867
Dig in.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.600
- Yum!
- That's awesome!

06:02.700 --> 06:03.833
How'd you learn
to cook like that?

06:03.933 --> 06:05.700
- I was in my lair trying
to make a cherry bomb.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.100
Next thing I know,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.767
I made a cherry pie
that was the bomb.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.467
- So, everybody
enjoying my chili?

06:12.567 --> 06:15.167
- No, we're enjoying
this chili.

06:15.267 --> 06:18.067
We spit yours out.

06:18.167 --> 06:20.700
Let me try.

06:22.767 --> 06:25.400
Hm, not bad.
What's in it?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.400
- It's a family secret.
Sorry, Wong.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.267
- No hard feelings.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.200
- Yeah, I think we're done.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.600
- All right, chili,

06:46.700 --> 06:50.933
surrender your mysteries
to the long arm of Wong.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.600
- Okay, Link,
this is perfect.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.167
Six civilians trapped
in an elevator.

06:58.267 --> 07:00.800
Now, remember, the number
one superhero rule--

07:00.900 --> 07:03.533
saving lives comes
before family and friends.

07:05.067 --> 07:08.367
- Those six people in there
are your girlfriends now.

07:08.467 --> 07:09.733
No, don't worry.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.300
This is a nice beginner-
level save, okay?

07:11.400 --> 07:13.567
There are six lives at stake.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.933
Those cables could snap.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.567
- Link, this isn't a cartoon.
Cables don't just snap.

07:19.267 --> 07:20.733
- Oh, no, the cables
are snapping!

07:20.833 --> 07:24.167
They're gonna fall!
- My girlfriends!

07:24.267 --> 07:27.133
- You caught them.

07:27.233 --> 07:28.733
That was incredible.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.700
- There, I pulled them
to the next floor.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.267
Let's get them out.

07:36.967 --> 07:39.700
- I can't believe this.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.400
- Thank you so much.
How did you--

07:41.500 --> 07:43.067
- Oh, we didn't do anything.

07:43.133 --> 07:45.167
Just, uh, two kids hangin'
out at an office building.

07:45.267 --> 07:46.900
Okay, thanks, bye.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.567
- Saving people
feels amazing!

07:50.667 --> 07:52.167
I think I'm hooked.

07:52.267 --> 07:53.567
It's all because of you.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.767
Thank you.
- Oh...

07:55.867 --> 07:57.367
Wait a minute.

07:57.467 --> 07:59.667
If you're hugging me,
who's holding the elevator?

08:01.633 --> 08:03.533
- Guess we're taking
the stairs.

08:03.633 --> 08:08.900
- *

08:09.067 --> 08:11.733
- Max, you've gotta
see this.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.900
- Hey, hey, hey,
Chili D. Williams

08:16.067 --> 08:18.967
here with a preview
of this week's "Chili Wars."

08:19.067 --> 08:22.067
We're in Hiddenville with
contestant Mrs. Wong.

08:22.100 --> 08:25.967
Mmmmm, smells like you've
got a pretty good chance

08:26.067 --> 08:27.967
of winning this week's
big cash prize.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.833
Do I detect a little, uh...

08:29.933 --> 08:31.800
...sweet potato
fries in there?

08:31.900 --> 08:34.667
- Uh-uh-uh, it's a secret
family recipe.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.333
And if anybody
says I stole it,

08:36.433 --> 08:39.067
he's a liar!
- Oh, wow.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.900
- I can't believe
Wong stole my recipe.

08:42.067 --> 08:44.967
I mean, I can.
But I can't!

08:45.067 --> 08:47.100
- We can't let her win that
money with your chili.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.100
- Yeah, you've gotta
enter that cooking contest.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.233
- Whoa! Villains
don't cook on TV!

08:53.333 --> 08:55.367
You'll ruin
your evil reputation.

08:55.467 --> 08:58.767
By the way, I booked you
a pedicure with Chloe at 2:00.

08:58.867 --> 09:00.500
- Thank you.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.867
And you're right--I can't
be seen cooking in public.

09:03.967 --> 09:07.667
But someone else can.

09:07.767 --> 09:10.633
- Let's get cookin'!

09:10.733 --> 09:13.100
- Uh, I meant
Billy and Nora.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.067
Sorry, pal.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.167
- Link's been so busy
saving people all week,

09:19.267 --> 09:21.100
I'm actually starting
to miss him.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.333
And that's how you make
a relationship work.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.533
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

09:25.633 --> 09:27.200
Link Evilman approaching.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.733
- Oh, yay, Link's here.
I'm so excited.

09:29.833 --> 09:33.267
I actually mean it.
- I'm so happy for you.

09:33.367 --> 09:36.767
- Uh, is that why your
butt's lighting up?

09:36.867 --> 09:41.267
- Oh, yeah, I knitted
my phone into my pants.

09:41.367 --> 09:44.833
Sorry, Mom, I must've
butt-dialed you.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.800
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey, Phoebe.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.167
Sorry I've been so caught
up with my new hobby.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.367
I just didn't think
I'd be so good at it.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.067
- Hey, you're on your way
to being a great boyfriend.

09:56.167 --> 09:58.267
I mean, hero, a great hero.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.167
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

10:00.267 --> 10:03.000
Incoming transmission from
Super President Kickbutt.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.933
- Hi, Super President Kickbutt.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.933
I suppose you're
checking in on me?

10:07.033 --> 10:08.300
- No, I'm calling for Link.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.767
- Oh, uh, how'd you
know he was here?

10:10.867 --> 10:12.733
- The same way I know
your baby sister

10:12.833 --> 10:16.733
is running an unlicensed
nail salon.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.333
- Adios!

10:19.433 --> 10:22.133
- Link, you've really been
stepping up your game.

10:22.233 --> 10:24.133
You're on your way to
becoming a great hero.

10:24.233 --> 10:25.900
- That's exactly what I said.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.867
You know, I think he's
making great strides--

10:27.967 --> 10:29.800
- Pipe down, Phoebe.
- Okay.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.567
- This is official business.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.567
Link, the Hero League
has decided

10:33.667 --> 10:36.300
to give you your own
city to protect.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.833
- Wow! Thank you!

10:37.933 --> 10:39.467
- This is so exciting.

10:39.567 --> 10:41.733
You're gonna get to protect
your hometown just like me.

10:41.833 --> 10:44.167
- No, we're sending
Link to Hong Kong.

10:46.933 --> 10:48.400
- Wow, that's, uh,

10:48.500 --> 10:50.500
all the way on the other
side of the world.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.100
And not at all
what I'd planned.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.100
- Phoebe, he may
need your help.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.700
- No, right now.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.533
He's fainting.

11:04.967 --> 11:07.200
- I can't believe you're
sending Link to Hong Kong.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.067
Don't you have anything
closer--like,

11:09.133 --> 11:11.600
I don't know,
Nearby Falls?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.267
- I know Hong Kong is far.

11:13.367 --> 11:15.633
But there's no one
to protect their elevators--

11:15.733 --> 11:17.800
now that their
stretchy superhero,

11:17.900 --> 11:20.333
Bungee Boy, is gone.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.767
- Let's just say there
was too much "boy"

11:22.867 --> 11:25.867
and not enough "bungee."

11:25.967 --> 11:27.433
You leave in two days.

11:27.533 --> 11:30.300
Super President Kickbutt out!
- But President--

11:30.400 --> 11:33.133
- I said out!

11:34.833 --> 11:37.733
- I can't believe this.
- I know.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.533
- I'm gonna be a superhero!

11:40.633 --> 11:44.067
- Oh, we're going with that.
Okay, yay!

11:44.133 --> 11:46.600
- This is a dream come true.
I can't wait to tell my parents.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.433
They're gonna be so mad.

11:52.067 --> 11:54.600
- Link is gonna be
a superhero in Hong Kong?

11:54.700 --> 11:55.933
That's so exciting.

11:56.067 --> 11:58.767
- No, Cherry, it means
we can't be together.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.467
Look, if Link is a superhero,

12:00.567 --> 12:03.167
he's gonna be way too busy
and way too far away.

12:03.267 --> 12:07.333
If it's 8:00 a.m. here,
over there it's next Tuesday.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.400
- Oh.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.100
Well, can't you just
ask him not to go?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.267
- Did you see how
excited he was?

12:13.367 --> 12:16.133
It'd be selfish of
me to ask him to stay.

12:16.233 --> 12:18.300
You know what wouldn't
be selfish--

12:18.400 --> 12:22.233
making him realize
he wants to stay.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.667
- Oh, sweetie,
this isn't a toy.

12:29.767 --> 12:31.400
It's a highly-
sophisticated puzzle.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.600
It takes a lot of patience
and a keen eye

12:33.700 --> 12:37.867
to know where
each piece goes.

12:37.967 --> 12:42.200
- This piece goes here.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.433
- Barb, Chloe's messin'
with my stuff!

12:45.533 --> 12:47.500
- Learn to share, Hank.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.867
Now it's just
us for dinner.

12:49.967 --> 12:51.567
What should we have?

12:51.667 --> 12:54.300
Wait. Where are
all my pots?

12:57.800 --> 13:00.567
- Let the "Chili Wars" begin!

13:04.200 --> 13:05.967
Listen, Wong, there's
no way you're winning

13:06.067 --> 13:09.567
that cash prize with your
"secret family recipe."

13:09.667 --> 13:12.200
- I didn't say it
was "my family."

13:12.300 --> 13:14.200
- Well, we have another
secret ingredient.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.167
My family over there's
gonna teach you

13:16.267 --> 13:18.200
a thing or two about
winning the "Chili War."

13:18.300 --> 13:21.800
- Yah! Yah!

13:21.900 --> 13:25.800
- They're just, uh...
warming up their spoons.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.133
That's another
family secret.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.067
- Do you really think
this is gonna work, Max?

13:34.133 --> 13:36.167
- Yes, no one's gonna know
I'm doing all the cooking

13:36.267 --> 13:40.067
because you two are my kitchen
puppets, remember, huh?

13:42.633 --> 13:43.867
- I like being a puppet.

13:43.967 --> 13:45.767
Take the wheel, Max.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.667
- Hey, hey, hey,
I'm Chili D. Williams

13:50.767 --> 13:52.467
coming to you
from Hiddenville,

13:52.567 --> 13:54.667
where this week's episode
of "Chili Wars"

13:54.767 --> 13:56.667
is gonna be hotter
than a habanero.

13:56.767 --> 13:58.567
Let's meet our first
two contestants--

13:58.667 --> 14:01.467
Billy and Nora Thunderman.

14:01.567 --> 14:02.767
Who's this guy?

14:02.867 --> 14:06.367
- Uh, I'm Fred Not-a-Cook.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.567
- Ha. Ha. All right.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.300
Are you two ready for
the battle of the beans?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.867
- We sure are.

14:13.967 --> 14:15.800
Make sure you shoot
my bow-side, too.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.700
Can I call ya Chill?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.433
- Ha. Ha. You sure can,
baby bean.

14:19.533 --> 14:20.700
Just stay outta my light.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.200
All right,
let's get cookin'.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.933
- Okay, first we get...

14:27.067 --> 14:32.067
- ...beans...
and dump them in the pot--

14:32.167 --> 14:33.733
totally on our own.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.300
- Look who's cookin'
like a big boy.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.067
- Then I get some...

14:39.100 --> 14:41.833
- ...some salt and I put
it in the pot.

14:41.933 --> 14:43.233
Oh, wait, no!

14:43.333 --> 14:45.133
Looks like it's
goin' on the meat.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.600
- Then I knock over
the pepper.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.133
- Ah...achoo!

14:51.233 --> 14:54.267
I'll take care of that.

14:54.367 --> 14:57.300
- Uh, you do know
we're on TV, right?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.933
- Oh, sorry.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.167
I'll take care of that.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.800
- Ohhhh, Chili D's
stickin' a fork in ya

15:05.900 --> 15:08.933
'cause you are done.
- Ow.

15:09.067 --> 15:11.167
- I can do that.
I'm a TV star.

15:11.267 --> 15:13.233
Let's see who's next.

15:16.067 --> 15:18.167
- [silent sneeze,
silent laugh]

15:22.733 --> 15:24.267
- Oh, this looks great.

15:24.367 --> 15:26.500
How could Link not want to stay
in Hiddenville with this?

15:26.600 --> 15:28.067
Thanks, Cherry.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.967
- A funny story
about setting this up--

15:30.067 --> 15:32.233
- Uh-oh, no time.
Here comes Link! Hide!

15:38.167 --> 15:39.667
- Phoebe, I still have
to say goodbye to my parents.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.500
They are so mad.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.967
Whoa, what's all this?

15:44.067 --> 15:46.067
- Just "The story of us."
Come on.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.200
I was thinking after
the amazing day we've had

15:48.300 --> 15:49.800
we order a black
and white cookie

15:49.900 --> 15:51.167
seeing as my hair
is kind of black

15:51.267 --> 15:53.867
and yours is kinda...
white-ish.

15:53.967 --> 15:56.767
The point is you
and I go great together--

15:56.867 --> 15:58.667
just like
a black and white cookie.

16:02.233 --> 16:05.400
Well, nope,
that's not the idea.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.133
- Actually, I prefer
it this way.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.067
The vanilla's much
better on its own.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.667
'Cause I think
that the two parts

16:10.767 --> 16:14.833
make one perfect whole
which should never be separated.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.367
No. No way. No.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.700
How about a slide show?

16:23.867 --> 16:25.667
- Oh, it's us at the park.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.167
That's the time
we tried to make pizza.

16:28.267 --> 16:30.467
Oh, and that's me--eating
this cookie ten seconds ago.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.600
How...how did you--
- Shhhh. Just watch.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.833
We've had a lot of
great times together.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.600
How does that
make you feel?

16:36.700 --> 16:38.833
- Like the luckiest
guy in the world.

16:38.933 --> 16:40.333
- Aw...

16:40.433 --> 16:42.133
- Oh.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.333
Oh, I have to check
in for my flight.

16:44.433 --> 16:45.833
- Aw.

16:45.933 --> 16:49.567
No baggage for this guy.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.700
- I'll be right back.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.167
Cherry, this is not
going well.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.167
He's still planning
on going to Hong Kong--

16:58.267 --> 17:00.767
with no baggage.

17:00.867 --> 17:04.600
- I had a feeling your creepy
slide show wouldn't work.

17:04.700 --> 17:09.200
- So, I knitted you
a sweater to give to him.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.967
- Oh, wow, "Phoebe
Hearts Link."

17:12.067 --> 17:14.167
It's perfect!

17:14.267 --> 17:16.700
Except for the extra
neck hole.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.867
- It's like they have
a mind of their own.

17:21.467 --> 17:25.267
- Wait a minute--this
is exactly what I need.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.233
Isn't this great?

17:28.333 --> 17:31.167
We've never been closer
than we are right now.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.933
- This is definitely close.

17:34.067 --> 17:36.433
- We are back
in Hiddenville

17:36.533 --> 17:38.967
where each batch
of chili so far

17:39.067 --> 17:41.300
has been worse
than the last--

17:41.400 --> 17:45.067
which means if your
chili tastes like food,

17:45.167 --> 17:47.167
the cash prize
is yours.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.200
- Well, why don't
you have a bite?

17:49.300 --> 17:52.167
- All right.

17:52.267 --> 17:53.667
- Max, what are
you doing?

17:53.767 --> 17:55.600
- If I'm not winning
the money, neither is Wong.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.867
- I don't know why
I'm holding these.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.467
- It looks like you're
adding your secret ingredient.

18:01.567 --> 18:04.233
Oh!

18:04.333 --> 18:07.600
- Which is a dash
of crazy.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.467
- If you think that's crazy...

18:09.567 --> 18:15.500
- What...
What's happeni

18:22.800 --> 18:25.067
Did I win?

18:27.133 --> 18:30.233
- No! No! You lost
the "Chili War"

18:30.333 --> 18:31.967
and your mind!

18:32.067 --> 18:33.933
But you do get this.
- Ow!

18:35.533 --> 18:37.667
I'm Chili D. Williams and
this has been "Chili Wars."

18:37.767 --> 18:39.467
We'll see you next week.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.067
And cut!

18:41.100 --> 18:42.967
This mess is never
gonna air.

18:43.067 --> 18:44.967
Pack it up, boys.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.967
I should've never
left game shows.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.067
Boop!

18:49.100 --> 18:50.667
- Ow!

18:54.900 --> 18:56.167
- Another family secret--

18:56.267 --> 18:59.067
stir your chili with
your spoon, not your face.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.367
- Hmph!

19:05.667 --> 19:07.933
- Doesn't food taste better
when we're this close?

19:08.067 --> 19:09.367
- Well, I wouldn't know.

19:09.467 --> 19:12.067
All I can do is lick
tomato sauce off this knife.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.733
- Oh, here, we'll switch.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.933
- Careful. Careful.
- I got it.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.567
- Oh, gosh.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.733
- Oh, my gosh, Link.
I'm so sorry.

19:22.833 --> 19:25.600
Let me get you some ice.
Watch yourself.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.633
- Oh, wait, there's
some over here.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.600
- It's fine. I got it.
- No, I got it.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.933
- Mine's closer.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.967
- Phoebe, what are
we doing?

19:40.433 --> 19:42.533
- No, that's not
what I meant. It's just...

19:42.633 --> 19:44.633
I mean, my last day
in Hiddenville

19:44.733 --> 19:46.600
would be a lot more fun
if you weren't being so...

19:46.700 --> 19:49.933
well, clingy.
- I was just trying to--

19:50.067 --> 19:51.900
Wait. Did you say "clingy"?

19:52.067 --> 19:53.600
- I'm...I'm sorry,

19:53.700 --> 19:55.567
but you did put us in
a two-headed sweater.

19:55.667 --> 19:59.167
- Yeah, I know I did,
but, um...

19:59.267 --> 20:02.367
Okay, look, the whole
reason I wanted you

20:02.467 --> 20:04.900
to pick a hobby was because
you were being clingy.

20:06.533 --> 20:08.267
- You once insisted on

20:08.367 --> 20:10.233
holding my hand for
two straight weeks.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.200
- Because I'm crazy
about you.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.300
- You were in Mexico
with your family.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.733
- Well, I guess
I see your point.

20:17.833 --> 20:20.267
But why wouldn't you
just say something?

20:20.367 --> 20:21.567
- Well, because...

20:21.667 --> 20:23.767
I didn't want to
hurt your feelings.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.767
Link, I'm crazy
about you, too, okay?

20:25.867 --> 20:28.000
That's why I put together
this whole day--

20:28.100 --> 20:29.700
to make you wanna stay,

20:29.800 --> 20:32.567
so we wouldn't
have to break up.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.067
I...I didn't even
think about breaking up.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.867
- What did you think
was gonna happen?

20:37.967 --> 20:40.033
- I don't know. I...I guess
I was so excited

20:40.133 --> 20:42.033
about finally becoming
a superhero,

20:42.133 --> 20:44.167
that I just didn't
think about

20:44.267 --> 20:46.033
what it meant for us.

20:46.133 --> 20:48.900
- Well, it's all
I've thought about.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.533
- I don't wanna lose you.

20:50.633 --> 20:54.267
- I don't wanna
lose you, either.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.867
- Wow. Look, I'm calling
Kickbutt right now

20:56.967 --> 20:59.300
and I'm telling
her that I'm not going.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.100
- No. No, I can't
let you do that.

21:04.267 --> 21:06.133
I won't let you
turn your back

21:06.233 --> 21:08.133
on your dreams
because of me.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.900
You were a great
boyfriend, Link.

21:10.067 --> 21:13.867
And now you're gonna
be a great superhero.

21:13.967 --> 21:16.067
- Wow.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.367
So this is really happening.

21:20.567 --> 21:24.400
- Looks like someone
in Hiddenville needs saving.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.933
Someone in Hiddenville
also really needs a hug.

21:28.067 --> 21:32.067
- *

21:32.167 --> 21:34.067
- And maybe a kiss.

21:34.167 --> 21:39.833
- *

21:39.933 --> 21:41.467
- Okay.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.667
Guess I'd better
take care of this.

21:43.767 --> 21:47.967
- *

21:48.067 --> 21:49.633
Goodbye, Link.

21:49.733 --> 21:51.500
We'll always have
Splatburger.

21:51.600 --> 21:55.967
- *

21:59.500 --> 22:01.467
- So long as the kitchen
doesn't burn down!

22:01.567 --> 22:03.567
That's the emergency!

22:03.667 --> 22:05.967
- Cherry, what did
you do now?

22:10.667 --> 22:26.533
- *
