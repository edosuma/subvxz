00:02.753 --> 00:05.415
Pentagon officials continue
to deny any security breach...

00:05.589 --> 00:08.251
...and any responsibility for the events
of Dark Thursday.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.797
Experts predicted recovery
from Dark Thursday would take years.

00:12.971 --> 00:16.384
But here in Metropolis, the cleanup effort
has been remarkably-

00:18.227 --> 00:21.594
-public is stunned at how fast rubble
has been cleared from the streets.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.434
This is Genevieve Sparling reporting
live from-

00:25.651 --> 00:28.108
You've been out again all night,
haven't you?

00:28.278 --> 00:30.530
Can't do what I need to do
in the daylight.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.735
Clark, I know you want to help...

00:33.909 --> 00:37.322
...but you can't single-handedly rebuild
everything that's been destroyed.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.782
It's my mess, Mom, I need to clean it up.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.615
You're not responsible
for what happened.

00:42.793 --> 00:43.782
Zod is.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.040
Zod would not have been released...

00:47.214 --> 00:50.297
...if for once in my life
I'd listened to Jor-El...

00:50.634 --> 00:52.499
...and done what he asked me to do.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.005
I have chores to do.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.719
Hey.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.055
Hey.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.015
Are you okay?

01:04.481 --> 01:07.973
-Yeah, I'm ﬁne.
-C|ark, wait, wait, wait.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.942
I've never seen you this worn out.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.152
Even you have your limits.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.531
-The chores can wait.
-l'm okay.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.488
Really. I'm ﬁne.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.854
What the hell?

03:36.258 --> 03:38.499
You know, for someone
about to change addresses...

03:38.677 --> 03:40.542
...you're traveling pretty light.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.966
Yeah, well, I don't need a lot.
It's only temporary.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.757
They think the school should reopen
by next semester.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.893
It was nice of you to offer me a room
at the mansion.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.315
I don't know what I would have done.

03:56.904 --> 04:02.024
Lex, if you're not okay with this
and having second thoughts, then let's talk.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.494
There's nothing to talk about.
Everything's great.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.503
Clark, was that the ﬁrst time
you ever sneezed?

04:24.681 --> 04:27.718
The ﬁrst time I've had a scratchy throat
with my ears plugged up.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.635
-Ninety-eight point six.
-No fever.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.763
I'm no doctor, but it seems
like it's just a common cold.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.681
You're far from common, Clark.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.396
I don't remember
you ever even having the snifﬁes.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.520
I've never pushed myself so far
into overdrive before.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.111
You know, you said when you were
in that zone, your powers were gone.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.697
That means your immune system
was normal.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.157
You could have been exposed
to something there.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.539
Whatever it is,
I'm not really that sick, so....

04:54.711 --> 04:57.999
Hi. You guys are not gonna believe
what just happened to me.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.880
I'm out there jogging along,
minding my own business...

05:01.051 --> 05:03.212
...when out of nowhere, a barn door...

05:03.387 --> 05:06.379
...comes falling from the clear, blue sky
and almost crushes me.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.092
How does that happen?

05:10.268 --> 05:12.759
Maybe it fell from an airplane.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.772
Good guess, but the only thing up there
was a severely traumatized sparrow.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.276
Does Clarkie have the snifﬁes?

05:24.241 --> 05:26.027
It's just a little cold.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.360
Well, lucky for you,
l have the perfect remedy.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.530
Honey and a little bit of cayenne pepper.
Works every time.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.370
First it makes you sneeze,
but then I swear you're cured.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.332
-Lois, I'll pass.
-I think we're all out of cayenne, Lois.

05:41.383 --> 05:45.251
No, you're not. I'm just gonna whip up
a little bit of something here.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.889
Where did your barn door 90?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.767
It was here last night when I came
to drop off documents...

05:54.938 --> 05:56.439
...and now it's gone.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.439
Look at that. It is gone.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.021
And it's been ripped right off its hinges.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.772
Oh, my God, that barn door.
I knew it looked familiar.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.282
Now,
how in the world does that happen?

06:21.673 --> 06:22.753
Mr. Pontius.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.631
What the hell am I paying you for?

06:26.178 --> 06:27.918
I was followed again today.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.473
Black Range Rover, Edge City plates?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.258
I tracked it to an abandoned factory
on 5th and Hayworth.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.343
Then why are you still here?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.478
I'm on my way.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.226
I want this taken care of,
by any means necessary.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.940
Do you understand?

06:53.330 --> 06:56.948
I had no idea
I was moving into a fortress.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.162
Everywhere I turn,
there's another security guard.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.371
Lana, that gentleman's
not a security guard.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.587
He's a private investigator.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.679
Over the last few days,
it's become clear I'm being followed.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.464
By who?

07:15.018 --> 07:20.012
Well, I doubt I have to look much further
than the lowest branch on the family tree...

07:20.190 --> 07:21.270
...but I can't be sure.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.477
Have you called the police?

07:23.652 --> 07:26.735
After breaking every law imaginable
when l was inhabited by Zod...

07:26.905 --> 07:29.112
...I don't wanna go
anywhere near a badge.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.858
I can't trust anyone.
Not even my own security.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.780
You can trust me.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.086
Of course I can.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.379
Then I want you to have this.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.258
In case of an emergency.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.257
He's the best P.|. in Metropolis.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.762
If anything happens to me,
you need to call that number.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.346
Not the police.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.389
-Robert Pontius will make sure you're safe.
-Lex, don't talk like that.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.233
I'm just being cautious.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.294
-Chloe.
-How's this for a megadose of guilt money?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.922
I've got bigger news.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.755
What happened? Is everything all right?

08:33.930 --> 08:35.716
I sneezed.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.267
-And?
-And? Chloe, that's not normal.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.270
Well, Clark, nothing with you
is exactly normal.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.479
-I wouldn't call sneezing today's headline.
-You don't understand. I--

08:48.361 --> 08:50.272
-|--
-You what?

08:50.447 --> 08:51.812
Grab a tissue and get over it.

09:00.749 --> 09:01.738
Gesundheit.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.784
I tried to warn you.
I've come down with a cold.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.577
And become a walking air cannon.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.963
Let's get you out of here
before you blow again.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.341
At least I was able to cover
half my face that time. This morning...

09:13.511 --> 09:16.253
...I blew the barn door halfway
across Lowell County.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.762
It almost hit Lois.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.218
Lois, as in Lane?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.974
Now she's on a one-woman crusade
to ﬁnd an explanation.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.387
-She won't stop digging till she hits China.
-l'|l take care of Lois.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.066
You just take care of that cold.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.149
We have enough natural disasters
without having to worry...

09:30.320 --> 09:32.436
...about Hurricane Clark
looming off the coast.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.979
No.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.153
Just kidding.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.165
Well, I forgot what a concerned parent
you are.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.208
That's why you're having me followed?

09:55.387 --> 09:57.878
To make sure I don't destroy
the rest of the world?

09:58.056 --> 10:00.718
If I were having you followed, son...

10:00.892 --> 10:02.974
...you'd never know it.
I can guarantee that.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.181
I hate to disappoint you,
but whatever powers I had are long gone.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.314
If you're looking for an encore performance,
you're out of luck.

10:09.484 --> 10:13.147
-Elvis has left the building.
-You wanna ﬁnd out who's stalking you?

10:13.321 --> 10:15.607
I suggest you concentrate
on remembering...

10:15.782 --> 10:19.775
...every little, minute detail
of that horriﬁc day.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.195
Well, I guess I should have kept a blog...

10:23.373 --> 10:26.410
...because I suffered a total memory loss.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.372
Besides what Lana has told me,
those 24 hours are gone.

10:32.173 --> 10:36.007
The atrocities you committed,
they could have been witnessed by anyone.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.338
Lex, please, let me help you.

10:38.513 --> 10:42.051
I've been on the receiving end
of your help before, Dad. I think I'll pass.

10:45.312 --> 10:50.898
Listen to me. There are some adversaries
that cannot be defeated alone.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.517
Lex.Lex!

11:37.614 --> 11:39.855
The bear is hibernating, over.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.039
How you doing?

11:54.214 --> 11:57.126
This is one part about being human
I don't envy.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.460
It's not all that bad.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.967
You can lie on the couch all day
and watch DVDs...

12:01.137 --> 12:04.004
...while your mom makes
some doctor-certiﬁed chicken soup.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.470
Mom, I can watch DVDs
after I ﬁx the irrigation ditch.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.637
No, your health is a lot more important
than the irrigation ditch.

12:11.815 --> 12:15.353
We're in uncharted waters now, Clark,
and your Dad's not here to help us out.

12:15.527 --> 12:20.567
So, please, you have to trust
my instincts and rest.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.196
Okay?

12:26.496 --> 12:29.329
Lionel, is everything all right?

12:29.499 --> 12:30.830
Lex.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.991
He's gone.
I think he's been abducted.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.046
Who do you think is behind it?

12:38.842 --> 12:42.960
Considering what he stole from
the Pentagon, my initial reaction was...

12:43.138 --> 12:46.471
...the government, but after I spoke
to my contacts in Washington...

12:46.641 --> 12:48.552
...I don't think so. I--

12:49.686 --> 12:51.017
You have to ﬁnd him, Clark.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.520
Why? Lex and l have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.023
But you and Zod do.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.357
Lex insists he can't remember
anything that happened...

13:01.531 --> 13:05.490
...when he was possessed by Zod,
but he might not be honest about it.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.651
He might remember it all.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.992
Whoever his captors are,
if they put enough pressure on him...

13:11.166 --> 13:13.498
...he could tell the truth...

13:13.918 --> 13:15.419
...about you.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.220
Well, good morning, Mr. Invincible.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.898
Where am I?

13:40.111 --> 13:43.569
In your cage,
where every lab rat belongs.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.364
Oh, and before you even try escaping...

13:46.534 --> 13:49.367
...you might consider
you're hooked up to enough wattage...

13:49.579 --> 13:52.116
-...to drop an elephant.
-Who are you?

13:52.582 --> 13:57.372
Just someone who's interested
in how you possess superhuman powers.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.586
Powers?

14:01.966 --> 14:03.797
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.926
Oh, come on, Lex.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.588
We both know you were the one
at the Pentagon swatting away...

14:10.767 --> 14:12.883
...those bullets
like they were mosquitoes.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.677
And not even a scratch.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.391
Yeah, see, we--

14:17.565 --> 14:20.898
We saw it on the only working satellite
on Dark Thursday.

14:21.069 --> 14:25.108
So we know you have the powers.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.146
Just kind of wanna know how
you got them.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.153
My people are already on to you.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.118
Your people?

14:34.123 --> 14:38.412
I think that's the guy I caught
kind of roaming around outside.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.201
Pontius, right?

14:40.380 --> 14:43.372
The guy downstairs with the bullet
in his head.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.126
Enough foreplay, all right?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.339
Let's get this started.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.714
You're gonna tell me everything.

15:04.487 --> 15:08.696
See, I told you.
I am no Chicken Little and that is no acorn.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.023
Now, how is that remotely conceivable?

15:11.202 --> 15:14.319
-The Kents live miles away from here.
-Okay, it's deﬁnitely weird.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.829
I'll give you that.
But it's not Wall of Weird.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.992
-lt's called a microburst.
-A micro what?

15:20.169 --> 15:23.957
It's like a sudden mini-tornado. It happens
when there are extreme changes...

15:24.132 --> 15:27.545
...in the temperature. It's actually
not that unheard of in the Midwest.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.711
It was sunny and 75. There was nothing
extreme about the weather.

15:30.888 --> 15:34.051
You might not have felt it.
It's probably in the upper atmosphere...

15:34.225 --> 15:38.343
...but there must have been
some change in the barometric pressures.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.851
Either you've been watching
too much Weather Channel...

15:42.025 --> 15:44.892
...or a year at the Daily Planet
has turned you into a skeptic.

15:45.069 --> 15:48.277
It's called being realistic.
You might wanna try it once in a while.

15:48.448 --> 15:52.862
You told me that science can explain only
a fraction of what happens in this town.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.118
And this happens
to fall into that fraction.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.325
Look, Lois, I still believe in the paranormal.
Trust me.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.990
But you have to accept the fact
that sometimes...

16:01.169 --> 16:05.879
...the answers are no further away
than the pages of your Scientiﬁc American.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.051
What are you doing with a gun?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.395
We were speciﬁcally told
not to use violence.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.227
So?

16:25.401 --> 16:28.564
Look, I don't answer to anybody, okay?
Especially your boss.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.399
Now, what I want to know...

16:30.573 --> 16:33.940
...is how bullets bounced off his body
like ping-pong balls.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.702
Information like that is very valuable
on the open market.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.114
You were speciﬁcally hired--

16:41.292 --> 16:42.828
Yeah, well, guess what.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.584
I'm an entrepreneur, okay?

16:45.755 --> 16:50.089
So either you join my newest venture
or you can end up like the Pontius guy.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.633
Your choice.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.723
Hey, Lex.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.100
I was thinking.

17:02.313 --> 17:05.601
Why don't we try a little experiment?

17:05.775 --> 17:07.106
What are you doing?

17:07.276 --> 17:09.813
I told you, I don't remember
any of it happening.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.898
Yeah, but it did.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.734
And I wanna see it happen again.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.444
Please, no. No.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.827
Oh, God.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.090
Lois, what are you doing here?

17:40.268 --> 17:43.601
I wanted to personally hand-deliver
this article to your editor.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.430
-You're a journalist now?
-Yeah.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.975
Wow, that's a lot of words.

17:51.362 --> 17:55.605
The Smallville Ledger’s too small-minded
to appreciate investigative reportage...

17:55.783 --> 17:58.445
...so I thought the Planet would be
the perfect publisher.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.237
Lois, I hate to be the one to rain
on your Pulitzer parade...

18:02.415 --> 18:06.579
...but I really don't think that a story
about weather's gonna stand a chance...

18:06.753 --> 18:09.415
...when we're dealing
with the aftermath of Dark Thursday.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.002
No, this story is way more
than about wild weather, okay?

18:13.176 --> 18:15.838
Not only is it an exposé
on the paranormal...

18:16.012 --> 18:18.799
...it is a story about human triumph
over adversity.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.760
That barn door could have chopped me
in half. Read it.

18:22.185 --> 18:25.052
Funny, I don't remember there
being an E in "tornado."

18:25.730 --> 18:29.188
-Just a little typo.
-And the extra H in "weather"?

18:29.525 --> 18:32.858
You know what I think?
I think that you're just a little bit jealous...

18:33.029 --> 18:36.521
...that you're not the only one in the family
with a natural way with words.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.564
Really? Well, Lo, you know, you're right.

18:38.743 --> 18:42.406
I might be jealous of you,
but words have nothing to do with it.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.363
Fine. Forget the Daily Planet.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.283
I don't need this stuffy,
pseudo-intellectual rag.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.079
Out there somewhere is a newspaper
that knows a story when they see one.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.589
-Well, good luck.
-Thank you.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.099
Lana.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.526
What are you doing here?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.652
Actually, I'm living here now.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.993
You're looking for Lex. He's not here.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.372
Lex has gone missing, Lana.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.208
I think he may have been kidnapped.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.838
Oh, God.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.384
Has he mentioned any recent threats
against him?

19:44.100 --> 19:47.592
Lana, if you have any information that
might be able to help me ﬁnd him....

19:47.770 --> 19:48.976
I don't understand, Clark.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.973
Why are you the leader
of his search party?

19:53.150 --> 19:57.860
Lana, no matter what my differences are
with Lex, I don't wanna see him get hurt.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.988
Or maybe you have your own reasons.

20:02.785 --> 20:06.118
How'd you know that Lex was going
to be transformed into that monster...

20:06.289 --> 20:07.620
...before anyone else?

20:11.794 --> 20:14.001
Did you tell Lex about this?

20:15.965 --> 20:16.954
Not yet.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.048
Clark, I want an answer.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.298
You can't keep secrets
when Lex's life is in danger.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.638
If I had all the answers,
I wouldn't be here, Lana.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.727
Ijust wanna help ﬁnd Lex.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.434
Then do it.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.070
Don't pretend you're doing it for him.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.735
You've reached Robert Pontius.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.946
Leave your name and number.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.437
Mr. Pontius.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.102
What the hell am [paying you for?

22:45.573 --> 22:47.734
l was followed again today.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.490
Black Range Rover? Edge City plates?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.949
l tracked it to an abandoned factory
on 5th and Hayworth.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.956
-Then why are you still here?
-l’m on my way.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.922
Then what is it that turns...

23:09.096 --> 23:12.463
...a weak, hairless punk
into some superhuman Goliath?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.927
I honestly don't know.

23:15.352 --> 23:18.185
Well, I honestly don't believe you.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.972
Now, we know LuthorCorp
conducts research...

23:21.150 --> 23:24.563
...involving genetically enhanced
human strength.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.979
Now, you obviously did something
to yourself.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.441
-What was it?
-Do you really wanna know?

23:33.621 --> 23:35.577
A being from another dimension--

23:36.832 --> 23:38.618
Actually another planet.

23:38.793 --> 23:42.331
--inhabited my body
and gave me powers.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.213
It sounds ridiculous, but it's true.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.715
When he left me...

23:48.886 --> 23:51.002
...the powers went with him.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.796
That's it.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.886
That's all I know.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.521
Are you mocking me?

24:06.487 --> 24:10.025
Now, why would I mock a guy
who just shot me?

24:11.325 --> 24:16.536
You know, the ﬁrst gunshot
was a minor ﬂesh wound, Lex.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.617
Now, this one may sting a little more.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.204
-You wanna keep your girlfriend happy?
-All right.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.335
All right, you win.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.371
There's a serum.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.549
It's in a lab on the 33rd ﬂoor
of LuthorCorp.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.586
It's in the vault in the center cabinet.

24:33.764 --> 24:37.006
The code is Julian 452.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.645
Wagner, go.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.223
Lionel Luthor.

25:29.904 --> 25:33.522
All those hostile takeovers
haven't aged you a bit.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.658
Tell me, what's your secret?

25:37.912 --> 25:41.325
Well, perhaps I should give some credit
to a nightly nip.

25:41.498 --> 25:47.038
This 40-year-old Highland Scotch
certainly helps to smooth the stress.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.078
I vigorously recommend it.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.417
Welcome to Metropolis, Oliver.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.791
That's a nice gesture.

25:55.221 --> 25:58.133
So I guess I shouldn't be surprised,
should I?

25:58.307 --> 26:00.969
-You've always been so generous.
-Yeah.

26:01.143 --> 26:05.227
You know, Oliver, when I read in the papers
"Oliver Queen Moves to Metropolis"...

26:05.397 --> 26:06.773
...l was very curious.

26:06.941 --> 26:09.978
I mean, you've made such a name
for yourself in Star City.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.393
Why would you relocate?

26:13.989 --> 26:17.573
Well, how can you resist these views.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.655
Not to mention the crisp Midwestern air.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.369
You had a chance to touch base
with my son yet?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.920
Haven't had a chance,
been meaning to.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.922
How is old Lex doing by the way?
Has he stepped out of your shadow?

26:33.092 --> 26:38.212
Oh, he's changed a lot
since your boarding school days together.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.088
Well, we all have.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.808
You know what, Lionel? You've inspired me.
I'm gonna give him a call.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.516
Yeah. I'll call him today.

26:47.690 --> 26:52.730
You could have a hard time reaching him.
Lex, it seems, has been abducted.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.859
He's been abducted?

26:55.364 --> 26:56.774
My God.

26:57.241 --> 26:58.856
Oh, Oliv—

26:59.034 --> 27:04.495
I remember in the Excelsior school plays,
you were always so good.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.124
So convincing.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.959
Lionel, I'm involved in a lot
of business ventures, as you know.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.960
But I can assure you...

27:14.758 --> 27:16.840
...kidnapping is not one of them.

27:19.722 --> 27:23.385
I remember, you have
an unpleasant history with my son.

27:23.559 --> 27:27.677
And I know Queen Industries had
the only working satellite on Dark Thursday.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.858
I know, I know, Oliver.

27:32.026 --> 27:35.735
You've suffered through a lot
in your young life.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.988
But if you have so much
as laid a hand on Lex...

27:40.159 --> 27:42.195
...the word "suffer"...

27:42.703 --> 27:44.739
...will take on a whole new meaning
to you.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.077
Sounds like a threat.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.880
Have a pleasant stay
in Metropolis, Oliver.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.051
However brief it is.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.940
I never thought I'd utter these words,
but you don't look so hot.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.451
I don't feel so hot. I bailed out
of super-speed around 3rd Avenue.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.533
Jogged the rest of the way.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.369
Then take a seat. Calm down.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.955
But if you feel the slightest inkling
of a sneeze...

28:34.129 --> 28:37.462
...you cover your face
and Ziploc it shut, okay?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.340
I went to Lex's mansion.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.305
I saw Lana.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.849
So you know
about the new domestic partnership?

28:55.484 --> 28:58.066
It's like we don't even know
each other anymore.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.480
I told her about Lex.
She made a phone call...

29:02.658 --> 29:05.320
...to someone named Robert Pontius.

29:05.828 --> 29:08.114
The highest paid Sam Spade
in Metropolis?

29:09.498 --> 29:11.113
Maybe Lex knew he was in trouble.

29:12.334 --> 29:15.121
I want to talk to this guy
and see what he knows.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.997
When you escaped from
that Kryptonian Land of the Lost...

29:19.174 --> 29:21.335
...I bet you didn't think
you'd be rewarded...

29:21.510 --> 29:24.297
...by having to save Lex Luthor
while battling a raging cold.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.338
Not exactly the goodbye gift
I was expecting, no.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.632
I guess heroes don't get sick days.

29:31.854 --> 29:35.221
They also don't put the world in jeopardy
on an annual basis.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.563
I'm no hero, Chloe. There it is.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.976
-515 Grant Street.
-Okay, let's get out of here.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.022
-Chloe, this could be dangerous.
-Yeah, especially for you.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.532
I mean, you barely got here.
You need to conserve your energy.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.153
Oh, God.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.663
Quick hands.
You're getting good at that.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.051
Chloe, it's Lana.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.346
Whenever you get this message,
I need you to check out an address:

30:17.524 --> 30:19.856
1024 Hayworth.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.392
Call me.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.193
Looking for Lex?

30:31.580 --> 30:32.990
Are you okay?

30:33.165 --> 30:34.701
Perfect.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.992
God, and I was expecting ceiling fans
and cigarette butts.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.206
I think this guy can afford central air.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.300
All right, I'm a decent hacker,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

30:46.470 --> 30:50.463
You really don't give me enough credit
for all this stuff. It's not easy.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.429
-Chloe.
-These encryptions—

30:55.604 --> 30:57.720
It'll take me hours
to get into Lex's account.

30:57.898 --> 30:58.887
Chloe.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.182
There's a hidden door in the wall.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.769
Even with a stuffy nose, you still got it.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.126
What's wrong?

31:22.130 --> 31:24.792
-I guess I'm not a hundred percent.
-Yeah, I can see that.

31:24.967 --> 31:28.459
Looks like your batteries
are running seriously low.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.130
What about a sneeze?

31:33.642 --> 31:35.303
What about it?

31:35.686 --> 31:38.928
If your sneeze could blow a barn door
seven miles across Smallville...

31:39.106 --> 31:41.893
...I bet you anything you could take
that one out no problem.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.058
-Chloe, I just can't force it.
-Why not?

31:44.236 --> 31:47.478
-You can do anything—
-Except sneeze on command.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.439
It's a reﬂex, not a circus trick.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.108
Then blow.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.153
-That's not funny.
-l'm not kidding.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.789
Clark, with a sneeze like yours,
that says a lot about your lung capacity.

31:59.960 --> 32:04.078
Now, just take a really deep breath
and blow it out as hard as you can.

32:04.423 --> 32:08.166
-That's a steel door, not a birthday cake.
-I don't see anything else working.

32:08.343 --> 32:11.426
Let's see what you got.
Huff, puff and blow this door down.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.915
Good thing you didn't have garlic today.

32:52.095 --> 32:56.384
Okay, so either Pontius is interested
in purchasing a used-furniture warehouse--

32:56.558 --> 32:58.719
This is where he thinks Lexis.

32:59.436 --> 33:02.269
-Taxi's leaving. Let's roll.
-You're not rolling anywhere.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.225
I can't guarantee your safety.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.685
I don't want a guarantee, Clark.
I want to help.

33:06.860 --> 33:10.102
-Go back to the Daily Planet. Wait for me.
-Clark, I don't—

33:28.215 --> 33:30.046
Lex. Lex, what have they done to you?

33:30.217 --> 33:31.673
-What is she doing here?
-Hey.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.586
Well, Lex, let's just say
that she's here to spend...

33:35.764 --> 33:38.255
...a little quality time with you.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.685
Let her go. You don't need her.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.717
Well, see, that's not quite true.

33:42.896 --> 33:45.057
Because now that we have your serum...

33:45.232 --> 33:48.099
...we're gonna need
somebody to use it on.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.767
And...

33:51.113 --> 33:55.402
...l'd say your girlfriend is as good
a guinea pig as anyone, wouldn't you?

33:57.786 --> 34:00.323
Now, in case...

34:01.206 --> 34:02.946
...this stuff really does turn you...

34:03.125 --> 34:07.118
...into some kind of super chick...

34:07.295 --> 34:10.287
...just remember, there's a gun pointed
at your boyfriend's head.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.921
-Get away from me.
-Wait.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.916
It won't work on her.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.177
The serum was tailored
for my blood chemistry.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.053
Lex, no.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.300
Well....

34:25.564 --> 34:30.228
Then I guess it's time to wake
the sleeping dragon.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.741
Get back. Stay back.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.247
Bitch.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.683
See if there's anything you can cut
the fence with.

35:28.001 --> 35:28.990
Lex, the hatch.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.215
Help me.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.312
Lana, this is all my fault.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.101
I'm so sorry.

36:37.654 --> 36:42.444
Hey, I brought something for us to do
in case the lake's too cold to swim in.

36:42.617 --> 36:46.360
And the great thing is,
we don't have to wait for it to get windy.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.369
Gee, thanks.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.990
Come on. Doesn't it make you wonder
what else the possibilities are?

36:52.168 --> 36:56.127
I mean, Clark Kent Airlines.
Nonstop to Metropolis.

36:56.298 --> 36:57.913
Miracles really do happen.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.332
Man walked on the moon.
Call waiting was created.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.002
And Lois Lane got her ﬁrst byline
on the front page of the Inquisitor.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.636
Hey, that's great, Lo.

37:07.517 --> 37:10.554
I don't know how I feel
about the alien angle, but--

37:10.729 --> 37:13.220
Yeah, I wasn't too crazy
about the ET. spin either...

37:13.398 --> 37:16.185
...but my editor insisted
it'd helps sell papers, so--

37:17.235 --> 37:19.817
Well, let's hear it
for journalistic integrity.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.821
Look, I swear, you guys,
when l was writing that article—

37:22.991 --> 37:25.858
I don't know, I don't think
I've ever been happier in my life.

37:26.036 --> 37:30.450
The thrill of discovery, the clacking of keys,
the scent of fresh ink.

37:30.624 --> 37:32.706
Yeah, I think I ﬁnally found my calling.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.538
Hey, how about you come join us
at the lake?

37:39.716 --> 37:42.549
We can celebrate your ﬁrst article
with a splash.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.754
Have you looked in the sky lately?
It looks like it's gonna rain.

37:46.932 --> 37:50.140
Since I don't like swimming in the rain,
I'll see you guys around.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.289
It worked.

38:51.413 --> 38:52.869
Hey.

38:53.456 --> 38:57.574
When I moved in, you forgot to mention
I'd be living with Big Brother.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.583
Lana, those are just security cameras...

38:59.754 --> 39:02.416
...to ensure the safety
of everyone on this property.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.171
I see.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.890
Was I breaching security
when l was alone in my bedroom?

39:18.314 --> 39:20.020
Lana.

39:20.191 --> 39:24.184
Okay, you clearly have the wrong idea.

39:25.155 --> 39:28.522
Those cameras are only viewed
if there's an emergency.

39:29.451 --> 39:32.238
I would never invade your privacy
like that.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.490
But you already have.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.750
Lex...

39:38.793 --> 39:41.375
...the cameras go or I do.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.172
The camera in your room will be down
within the hour.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.337
But the rest of them stay.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.297
You're free to make
other arrangements, Lana...

39:53.475 --> 39:55.841
...but this is the way I live.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.643
And it's not gonna change.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.848
I thought I made myself clear.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.607
You were only to use violence
if you were in danger.

40:47.403 --> 40:52.022
Mr. Queen, I told you, Block went rogue.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.657
I tried to stop him,
but he would have killed me too.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.535
Well, we couldn't have that now,
could we?

40:57.747 --> 41:01.410
I guess I'm just gonna have to start
being more careful as to who I trust.

41:01.584 --> 41:04.542
Speaking of which,
how's my old buddy Lex doing?

41:04.754 --> 41:07.791
Whatever powers he had
are clearly gone.

41:11.928 --> 41:15.420
But, sir, there was someone else
in the warehouse.

41:16.224 --> 41:19.387
Someone who seems to have
other abilities.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.137
Find him.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.979
How about--?

41:30.613 --> 41:32.353
Borneo.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.234
