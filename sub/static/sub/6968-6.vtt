00:18.685 --> 00:20.687
Mulder, it's me.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.482
I just had something
incredibly strange happen.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.985
This piece of metal
that they took out of duane Barry...

00:27.110 --> 00:29.238
it has some kind
of a code on it.

00:29.279 --> 00:33.158
I ran it through a scanner, and
some kind of a serial number came up.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.495
What the hell is this thing, Mulder?
It's almost as if...

00:36.537 --> 00:39.957
It's almost as if somebody
was using it to catalog him.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.548
-Come on!

00:47.589 --> 00:50.926
- Mulder! I need your help! Mulder!

01:09.278 --> 01:12.823
Take two men and a team...

01:44.479 --> 01:46.982
Take that down to the lab.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.753
- Mulder!
- Lady...

02:08.753 --> 02:10.964
I need your help!
Mulder!

02:20.891 --> 02:22.309
Mulder!

02:23.227 --> 02:25.646
Sorry, ma'am.
You can't disturb a crime scene.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.190
This is
my daughter's apartment. Let me go!

02:28.232 --> 02:30.984
I have to get through!
I have to get in!

02:31.276 --> 02:32.903
Mrs. Scully?

02:36.365 --> 02:38.283
She's not in there.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.994
Where is she?

02:42.955 --> 02:44.623
Where is she?

02:45.748 --> 02:49.045
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 06 - Ascension

03:41.972 --> 03:44.057
This is Holly Weir reporting live.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.727
Police have refused to identify
the kidnapping victim.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.104
However, we have received
unconfirmed information...

03:49.146 --> 03:51.481
I knew it would happen
this way.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.527
I had this dream
about Dana being taken away.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.406
It's so strange!

04:04.286 --> 04:06.788
I, uh...
I was gonna call her...

04:08.624 --> 04:11.460
but I was afraid
I was gonna scare her.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.220
She would have laughed
at me anyway.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.642
She doesn't believe
in that kind of thing, you know?

04:33.357 --> 04:35.651
According to
the reports I've reviewed...

04:35.692 --> 04:38.987
Agent Scully's research states
that Duane Barry's propensity
for violent, deviant behavior...

04:39.029 --> 04:42.533
is due to brain damage
from a bullet wound in the head.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.244
Is this
the operational opinion?

04:46.161 --> 04:48.830
- Yes, sir.
- Is there another?

04:48.872 --> 04:52.125
He's convinced he's going
to be abducted by aliens.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.213
But by taking someone
to the abduction site...

04:56.713 --> 04:59.049
he won't be abducted himself.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.847
That he's following orders
from alien voices in his head.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.140
Yes.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.854
Well, that's an interesting spin
on the Nuremberg defense.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.356
Which explanation do you subscribe to,
Agent Mulder?

05:14.398 --> 05:18.610
There's a question of how he could have
gotten to her in the first place.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.363
And you think these
alien voices told him.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.657
Agent Scully was carrying
a small piece of metal...

05:23.699 --> 05:26.034
that was removed
from Duane Barry's abdomen...

05:26.076 --> 05:28.078
an implant he described
as a tracking device.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.081
Agent Scully... thought
that you had made...

05:31.623 --> 05:34.918
a major miscalculation
in Duane Barry's psychosis.

05:35.419 --> 05:39.548
- Is that true?
- Yes, but that doesn't explain
how he could've found her.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.259
Where would he be taking her?

05:42.301 --> 05:45.345
I don'tknow. He...
He talked about a mountain...

05:45.387 --> 05:47.389
but he wasn't specific
about the location.

05:47.431 --> 05:51.101
However he got to her
and whatever his motives,
he took Scully's's car and weapon.

05:51.143 --> 05:54.938
I think we all understand
the seriousness of this matter
and should proceed quickly...

05:54.980 --> 05:56.940
with all possible resources.

05:56.982 --> 06:00.110
- I need you to turn over
your files to H.R.T.
- I'd like to brief them myself.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.738
Go home. You've been up all night.
Get some sleep.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.740
Sir, I know Duane Barry.
I've been in his head.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.285
- I know how he thinks.
- You're too close to this case!

06:08.702 --> 06:10.954
If we can use you, we will.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.583
- Sir...
- That's an order, Agent Mulder.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.753
Make sure he gets home safely.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.863
You'll see him
in your nightmares

06:44.905 --> 06:47.282
You'll see him
in your dreams

06:50.035 --> 06:52.412
He'll appear
out of nowhere

06:53.038 --> 06:55.290
But he ain't what he seems

06:59.086 --> 07:02.130
You'll see him in your head
on the TV screen

07:03.382 --> 07:06.343
Hey, buddy, I'm warning you
to turn it off

07:07.427 --> 07:09.596
He's a ghost
He's a god

07:09.638 --> 07:11.682
He's a man
He's a guru

07:14.560 --> 07:18.480
- You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

07:18.522 --> 07:21.483
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

08:08.614 --> 08:11.241
Sir, could you turn off
your radio?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.953
I would, Officer,
but I've got to keep going.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.623
An F.B.I. A.P.B.
has been issued for a suspect...

08:17.664 --> 08:20.209
in the abduction
of an F.B.I. agent.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.793
- Sir, I asked if you'd mind
turning that off.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.671
- Sir, I asked if you'd mind
turning that off.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.342
Okay. But could you just give me
the ticket now so I can go?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.553
I gotta be someplace.

08:31.595 --> 08:32.929
Where?

08:34.932 --> 08:38.268
I'm not sure, but they'll
tell me when I get there.

08:46.777 --> 08:50.572
Sir, put your hands on
the steering wheel where I can see 'em.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.034
You don't understand.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.455
They're waiting for me.
I can't be late.

09:01.250 --> 09:04.086
Put your hands up
and exit the vehicle!

09:04.837 --> 09:06.964
No, I gotta keep moving.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.801
Please?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.263
For your own sake?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.433
Don't stop Duane Barry.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.437
Sir, put your hands up!

09:47.588 --> 09:49.256
Right there.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.928
Back it up a few frames.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.726
Okay, now magnify
this area.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.949
- Oh, my God!
- She's still alive.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.410
Print this up.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.586
I just wanna go back to the place.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.589
- What place?
- Where it first started.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.926
- Where they first came and got me.
- Where is that?

10:34.551 --> 10:36.136
A mountain.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.140
We went, uh, up and up...

10:44.853 --> 10:46.438
ascending...

10:47.481 --> 10:49.525
ascending to the stars.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.740
- Ascending, ascending to the stars.
- Coffee?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.160
Yeah.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.789
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.707
How'd you sleep?

11:06.208 --> 11:08.627
- I didn't.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.422
They're not
taking Duane Barry again.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.719
A mountain.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.224
We went, uh, up and up...

11:25.561 --> 11:27.187
ascending...

11:29.064 --> 11:31.108
ascending to the stars.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.446
-Ascending to the stars.
- What is it?

11:36.488 --> 11:40.242
-Where was that patrolman killed again?

11:40.284 --> 11:42.786
Rixeyville, Virginia,
Route 229.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.583
- Doesn't Route 229 lead
to the Blue Ridge Parkway?
- I don't know.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.967
What?

12:07.060 --> 12:10.272
"Ascend to the Stars.
Skyland Mountain".

12:10.564 --> 12:12.566
- You know where he's going?

12:12.608 --> 12:14.693
Get your car and meet me
downstairs in five minutes.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.737
- Where are we going?
- Just get your car.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.865
- What about Skinner?
- I'll deal with Skinner.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.623
He thinks Scully's been taken
up to Skyland Mountain.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.459
I'll hold him off
until they locate her.

12:31.210 --> 12:34.004
Wait. Here he comes.
I'll be in touch.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.634
Come on. Let's go.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.263
- Hey!

13:28.141 --> 13:30.644
You're dozing off.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.938
- Maybe I should drive.
- I'm fine.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.233
- You haven't slept yet. I have.
- I said I'm fine.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.830
You know, Chernobyl,
Exxon Valdez, Three Mile Island...

13:49.913 --> 13:52.833
they were all linked
to sleep deprivation.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.920
The U.S. Department
of Transportation estimates...

13:56.962 --> 14:01.133
that over 190,000 fatal car crashes
every year are caused by sleepiness.

14:01.758 --> 14:06.388
Did they estimate how many
people are put to sleep
listening to their statistics?

14:06.805 --> 14:09.391
I'm just trying
to keep you awake.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.316
Look, I know you think
we should have told Skinner.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.028
But if he sends in the whole cavalry,
Duane Barry might go over the edge.

14:21.069 --> 14:24.531
- You're right.
- If we find him first,
we'll notify the Bureau.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.533
- All right?
- Yeah.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.329
You think he tracked her down
with that implant?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.081
Well, that's
the easiest explanation.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.376
It's also
the most implausible.

14:36.418 --> 14:40.714
- Is there another possibility?
- Somebody could've given him
her address.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.841
I don't know who.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.763
There's our turnoff.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.020
- Have you seen this guy?
- Yeah, he was here.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.314
He's wanted
for kidnapping a federal agent.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.316
Did you let him go up
on the tram?

14:59.358 --> 15:02.694
No way. It's shut down in the summer.
I told him to take the back road up.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.696
- How long ago?
- About 45 minutes.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.782
- Did he have a woman with him?
- No.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.451
- How long does it take
to drive to the top?
- A little over an hour.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.995
- You've got to get me up there.
- No. No way.

15:12.037 --> 15:14.164
We just got done
refitting the cable.

15:14.206 --> 15:16.667
It hasn't been tested
with passengers yet.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.669
- You'll have to drive.
- I don't have the time.

15:18.710 --> 15:22.214
- You don't have a choice.
- No, you don't have a choice.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.975
Okay, I can't stop you
from going up there.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.854
But if there's a problem with the cable,
I'm shutting this thing down.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.815
I'm not gonna be responsible
for your death.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.199
- What are you doing?
- Stay here...

15:49.241 --> 15:51.910
and whatever happens,
don't let him stop the tram.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.580
Okay, hit your "Run"
and "Up" button on the panel.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.499
"Speed Indicator"
controls your ascent.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.710
Now, when you wanna
slow down...

15:59.751 --> 16:02.129
Don't crank it faster
than 15!

16:35.704 --> 16:37.497
What's he doing?

16:37.789 --> 16:40.709
I told him not to go that fast.
Base to Car One, pick up.

16:43.504 --> 16:46.840
Do you hear that sound?
At this speed, the cable can't hold.

17:07.986 --> 17:11.531
This is Base.
Please pick up your hand set.

17:11.573 --> 17:15.243
Can you hear me? Slow it to 15,
or I'll shut this thing down.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.247
Base to Car One, pick up.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.917
- Base to...
- Go ahead.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.630
- Slow it down.
- You're breaking up.

17:26.922 --> 17:30.175
Slow it down,
or the cable will jump... the tower.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.907
The second tower's coming up.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.871
Slow it
through the next tower.

18:11.175 --> 18:14.595
- How close is he?
- He should be up top in a minute.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.016
There he is.

18:49.505 --> 18:52.174
What are you doing?
Turn us back on.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.052
Krycek,
what's happening down there?

18:55.093 --> 18:58.847
Krycek, do you read me?
Tell the operator to restart the tram.

18:59.681 --> 19:03.769
- Hello? Hello, Krycek,
can you read me?
- I've got him stalled up there.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.063
I'll hold
until you advise.

19:30.838 --> 19:34.174
Is there an emergency system on board?
Can you read me down there?

19:34.216 --> 19:36.093
Can anyone read me?

21:14.316 --> 21:17.569
Intermittent thunder showers
throughout the evening.

21:17.611 --> 21:19.821
Look for highs tomorrow
around 65 degrees...

21:19.863 --> 21:22.449
with tonight's low
near 58 degrees.

21:22.658 --> 21:25.911
That high-pressure ridge...

21:28.914 --> 21:32.084
Joining me now for the business report
is Sue Roberts.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.379
The dollar turned in a mixed performance
on the foreign exchange markets...

21:35.420 --> 21:37.673
while closing stronger here.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.842
Gold dropped
almost two dollars...

21:39.883 --> 21:42.594
in spite of continuing speculation
about in flationary trends.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.596
Silver was down 80 cents.

21:44.638 --> 21:47.599
The blue chip indicator rose slightly
in moderate trading...

21:47.641 --> 21:51.103
gains out numbering declines
by a margin of four to three.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.898
A government source
stated that the U.S. will abolish...

22:28.307 --> 22:30.517
Yes!

22:35.397 --> 22:37.566
- Federal agent!
- Yes!

22:38.150 --> 22:40.402
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Freeze!

22:41.445 --> 22:43.572
- Yes!
- I said freeze!

22:43.780 --> 22:46.992
- Where is she?
- I'm free, you son of a bitches!

22:47.784 --> 22:51.163
- You can't touch Duane Barry anymore!

22:51.205 --> 22:54.082
- Don't move! Don't move!

22:54.124 --> 22:56.543
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Where is she?

22:56.585 --> 22:59.046
- Where'd you leave her?
- They took her!

22:59.087 --> 23:00.797
- Who?
- Them!

23:01.548 --> 23:04.426
I told you they were gonna
take somebody else.

23:04.468 --> 23:06.553
They did!

23:07.596 --> 23:10.307
- No! No! No!

23:12.267 --> 23:13.852
No! No! No!

23:15.312 --> 23:16.563
No!

23:17.940 --> 23:19.566
No! No! No!

23:21.443 --> 23:22.736
No!

23:25.113 --> 23:26.365
No!

23:31.578 --> 23:34.873
Sheriff, search and rescue chopper
has found them on the mountain.

23:34.915 --> 23:38.752
We sent out five teams to search
for that missing federal agent.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.927
Drink of water?

23:54.518 --> 23:56.520
Wait outside.

24:28.719 --> 24:31.972
What happened after you
took her out of the trunk?

24:32.890 --> 24:36.393
We walked a little ways
up to the top of the mountain...

24:37.186 --> 24:39.354
right where you found me.

24:41.857 --> 24:44.693
- Then where'd you take her?
- I didn't.

24:45.986 --> 24:47.487
They did.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.909
That was the deal:

24:52.576 --> 24:54.453
her instead of me.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.218
Did you kill her?

25:09.384 --> 25:10.636
No.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.058
I swear.

25:16.642 --> 25:18.560
How'd you get this?

25:19.436 --> 25:21.813
- From the ship.
- What ship?

25:22.397 --> 25:25.067
- You saw it.
- I saw a helicopter.

25:25.359 --> 25:28.028
They were here!
I'm not lying to ya!

25:28.612 --> 25:30.822
There they are!
Ask them!

25:30.864 --> 25:34.117
- They know what happened! No!
- Sit down, Duane.

25:34.493 --> 25:37.162
You've got to stop 'em!
Hurry! Hurry!

25:37.204 --> 25:40.249
They were just out there!
They were right outside!

25:40.290 --> 25:42.584
- They...
- Duane, settle down!

25:42.626 --> 25:45.504
They'll tell you where she is!

25:46.463 --> 25:49.716
The military's in on it!
Just ask 'em!

25:54.513 --> 25:56.765
- Did you hurt her?
- No.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.269
- Did you hurt her? What is this?
- No!

26:40.267 --> 26:41.852
I'm sorry.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.317
They had to take her.

26:52.237 --> 26:55.199
I hope they're not hurting her...

26:57.034 --> 26:59.203
too much with the tests.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.081
I'm sorry.

27:17.554 --> 27:18.639
- Hey.
- Yeah?

27:18.680 --> 27:20.307
- Hey.
- Yeah?

27:20.349 --> 27:22.601
What's the matter?
What'd he say to you?

27:22.643 --> 27:24.895
Aw, he's giving me nothing.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.940
Were you out here alone?

27:27.981 --> 27:29.525
Yeah, why?

27:30.901 --> 27:33.278
Nobody goes in or out
of that room.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.739
- Hey, Mulder.
- No, thank you.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.669
- What are you doing in there?
- I heard him...

29:12.711 --> 29:15.422
- Come here. Come here.

29:16.006 --> 29:19.259
- I heard him gagging in there.
He couldn't breathe.
- No one... No one...

29:19.301 --> 29:22.179
- He said you choked him.
- No one is to interrogate the suspect.

29:22.221 --> 29:24.431
- Except you?
- Except me.

29:25.307 --> 29:27.601
- Did you ask him about Scully?
- Yep.

29:27.643 --> 29:31.396
- What'd he say?
- He started whistling
"Stairway to Heaven".

29:43.492 --> 29:46.119
- Keep an eye on him.
- Okay.

29:48.872 --> 29:51.458
- You got Duane Barry?
- Yes, sir.

29:54.503 --> 29:57.589
Agent Mulder,
You disobeyed my direct order.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.594
Call the paramedics!

30:05.097 --> 30:07.307
- What happened?
- He was gagging.

30:07.349 --> 30:10.018
- Duane. Duane.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.104
- Duane.

30:18.652 --> 30:20.404
Coming through.

30:24.867 --> 30:27.953
-Respirations?
-Hmm, nothing.

30:27.995 --> 30:29.580
Start C.P.R.

30:37.045 --> 30:40.048
- Ready? Go.
- One, two, three, four, five.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.929
One, two, three...

31:06.658 --> 31:08.243
Excuse me.

31:08.785 --> 31:12.289
I'm Agent Mulder. I'd like a copy
of this man's autopsy report.

31:12.331 --> 31:14.374
I'm sorry.
It's still incomplete.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.585
- Are you the pathologist?
- Yes.

31:16.627 --> 31:20.297
- Can I ask what your
preliminary findings are?

31:20.631 --> 31:23.383
Um, second-degree burns
on the face...

31:23.800 --> 31:26.762
contusions about the neck,
bruised larynx.

31:26.803 --> 31:31.058
If I had to list
cause of death at this point,
I'd have to say asphyxiation.

31:31.141 --> 31:33.727
Were you expecting
something else?

31:34.061 --> 31:36.188
You haven't run
a toxicological yet?

31:36.230 --> 31:39.608
- They should be finished shortly.
- I'd be interested to see what you find.

31:39.650 --> 31:42.694
- When will it be on file?
- Later this morning.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.988
I'd like a copy
as soon as possible, please.

31:45.030 --> 31:49.076
Well, I'm sorry. You'll have to go
through regular military channels.

31:49.368 --> 31:51.828
What do you mean,
"military"?

31:52.037 --> 31:55.791
- You're not F.B.I.?
- Quantico's under military jurisdiction.

31:55.916 --> 31:59.545
There wasn't an F.B.I. pathologist
available this morning.

32:30.826 --> 32:35.205
Skinner's expecting my report
on the Duane Barry incident.
What do I tell him?

32:35.247 --> 32:37.708
- The truth.
- What do you mean?

32:38.458 --> 32:42.129
Confirm Mulder's version of events.
You've earned his trust.

32:42.296 --> 32:45.424
- The object now is to preserve it.
- For how much longer?

32:45.465 --> 32:48.051
Until your assignment
is completed.

32:48.093 --> 32:52.347
- If Mulder's such a threat,
why not eliminate him?
- That's not policy.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.516
It's not?

32:55.601 --> 32:57.686
After what you had me do?

32:59.855 --> 33:03.400
Kill Mulder and you risk turning
one man's religion into a crusade.

33:03.442 --> 33:05.277
What about Scully?

33:05.569 --> 33:08.155
- We've taken care of that.
- How?

33:08.989 --> 33:11.241
We tell you only
what you need to know.

33:11.283 --> 33:13.619
- I think I have a right to know.
- You have no rights...

33:13.660 --> 33:15.996
only orders to be carried out.

33:18.582 --> 33:22.419
If you have a problem with that,
we'll make other arrangements.

33:31.386 --> 33:35.098
"Victim appears to have expired
from prolonged hypoxemia...

33:35.265 --> 33:37.476
secondary to asphyxiation.

33:37.976 --> 33:40.938
Of several possible etiologies,
the most likely is strangulation...

33:40.979 --> 33:44.149
due to the presence of contusions
and a bruised larynx".

33:44.191 --> 33:46.151
Do you want to speak to this,
Agent Mulder?

33:46.193 --> 33:48.362
I didn't kill him,
if that's what you're suggesting.

33:48.403 --> 33:52.407
- But you attacked him?
- I was interrogating him
about Agent Scully.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.868
He wasn't cooperating,
so I pushed him.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.870
And you lost control?

33:57.079 --> 33:59.831
Momentarily,
but then I left the room.

34:00.749 --> 34:04.127
He was very much alive. I spoke to him.
Agent Krycek spoke to him.

34:04.169 --> 34:08.215
Agent Krycek says he entered the room
because the suspect was gagging.

34:08.507 --> 34:11.510
Is Agent Krycek asserting
that I killed him too?

34:11.552 --> 34:14.012
No. He corroborates
your story.

34:15.681 --> 34:18.100
But the fact is, we've got
a dead suspect, Agent Mulder...

34:18.141 --> 34:20.893
and no other plausible
cause of death.

34:20.936 --> 34:26.024
O.P.C. wants the both of you
to take a lie detector test.
You are to report there immediately.

34:30.027 --> 34:32.239
There is another
plausible cause of death.

34:32.281 --> 34:33.782
Which is?

34:34.949 --> 34:37.661
Poisoning by injection
or ingestion.

34:38.536 --> 34:42.666
- Poisoning?
- You won't find that on
the navy pathologist's report.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.460
What are you saying,
Agent Mulder?

34:45.502 --> 34:50.382
That the autopsy is incomplete,
that the military covered up
the toxicological findings.

34:50.841 --> 34:54.761
- And why would they do that?
- Because they know where Scully is.

34:54.844 --> 34:58.223
- Why are you so paranoid, Mulder?
- Oh, I don't know.

35:00.434 --> 35:03.812
Maybe it's because I find it
hard to trust anybody.

35:09.401 --> 35:12.196
Alex. Alex, can I
borrow your car keys?

35:13.322 --> 35:15.574
- Why? Where are you going?
- There's somebody I gotta see.

35:15.616 --> 35:19.870
- But we're scheduled at O.P.C...
- I know. Just give me the keys, please.

35:19.912 --> 35:21.872
- Thanks.

35:37.387 --> 35:39.598
You wasted a trip,
Mr. Mulder.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.227
- There's nothing the senator
can do for you now.
- What?

35:43.393 --> 35:46.688
- Not without committing
political suicide.
- Why?

35:47.189 --> 35:49.358
Do they have something on him?

35:49.399 --> 35:51.902
They have something
on everyone, Mr. Mulder.

35:51.944 --> 35:54.404
The question is
when they'll use it.

35:54.446 --> 35:57.032
- I need his help.
- No one can help you now.

35:57.074 --> 36:00.202
Your channels of appeal
and recourse are closed.

36:00.577 --> 36:03.372
Your predecessor
could have helped me.

36:08.210 --> 36:10.170
You know, don't you?

36:14.007 --> 36:16.093
You know what's happened to her.

36:16.134 --> 36:19.930
This reaches beyond any of us,
Mr. Mulder. Even my predecessor.

36:20.347 --> 36:22.224
I want an answer!

36:24.893 --> 36:27.604
Why kill Duane Barry
if there was nothing to hide?

36:27.646 --> 36:29.606
You mean the government?

36:29.648 --> 36:32.484
There are no answers
for you, Mr. Mulder.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.696
They only have one policy:

36:37.948 --> 36:39.783
Deny everything.

37:58.737 --> 38:00.864
This is a serious allegation,
Agent Mulder.

38:00.906 --> 38:03.116
Only so far as it is true.

38:06.036 --> 38:09.081
"Agent Krycek was hired
or suborned by an outside agency...

38:09.122 --> 38:11.750
to impede a federal investigation
and may be responsible...

38:11.792 --> 38:14.711
for the death of a suspect
in a capital murder case"?

38:14.753 --> 38:16.296
It goes on.

38:17.714 --> 38:21.760
"And the possible murder of the tram
operator at Skyland Mountain".

38:22.970 --> 38:26.390
There's a lot of blood
on this document, Agent Mulder.

38:26.431 --> 38:29.393
- Are you standing behind this
going on the record?
- Yes, sir.

38:29.434 --> 38:33.188
Well, then you'd damn well
better have the facts to back it up.

38:33.272 --> 38:37.067
- I need to see Agent Krycek,
immediately.

38:48.036 --> 38:50.622
I can't protect you,
Agent Mulder.

38:51.957 --> 38:55.294
Past a point, this'll become
a larger Bureau matter.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.761
All right.
What do you got?

39:06.430 --> 39:08.807
I found this
in Agent Krycek's car.

39:08.849 --> 39:10.684
He doesn't smoke.

39:11.351 --> 39:15.272
Agent Krycek was the last person
with Duane Barry befrore he died.

39:15.314 --> 39:19.443
He was also the last person to see
the tram operator before he disappeared.

39:19.484 --> 39:21.445
When I got to the top
of Skyland Mountain...

39:21.486 --> 39:23.739
I saw an unmarked helicopter
working the area.

39:23.780 --> 39:26.867
I believe that Agent Krycek
gave away the where abouts...

39:26.909 --> 39:29.870
of Duane Barry and Agent Scully
to whoever he's working with.

39:29.912 --> 39:32.497
- And who is that?
- I don't know.

39:32.706 --> 39:36.418
The military? Some covert organization
within the government?

39:36.460 --> 39:39.254
Whoever it is that the man
who smokes those cigarettes works for.

39:39.296 --> 39:42.382
- Why?
- Because Agent Scully got too close...

39:42.883 --> 39:44.885
to whatever it is
they're trying to deny.

39:44.927 --> 39:47.262
Because she had
hard and damning evidence...

39:47.304 --> 39:49.598
that metallic implant
in her possession.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.975
Or because
her termination...

39:52.309 --> 39:55.687
would prevent further involvement
with me and my work.

40:00.692 --> 40:03.237
Do you think
Agent Scully's dead?

40:03.362 --> 40:05.072
I don't know.

40:06.698 --> 40:09.076
How far do you think they'd go?

40:11.537 --> 40:13.705
What do you know
about Agent Krycek?

40:13.747 --> 40:17.543
- I didn't give him
the assignment. I only...

40:26.343 --> 40:28.136
Yes. Thank you.

40:35.227 --> 40:38.480
Agent Krycek didn't show up
for work this morning.

40:39.231 --> 40:42.025
His home number
has been disconnected.

40:44.319 --> 40:46.321
That's it? He's gone?

40:47.447 --> 40:50.492
- He just disappears into the wood work?
- So it would appear.

40:50.534 --> 40:55.163
Who are these people
who can murder with impunity,
and we can't do anything about it?

40:55.205 --> 40:57.165
- Let it go, Agent Mulder.
- Like hell.

40:57.207 --> 41:00.711
- There's nothing you can do.
- What can you do about it?

41:03.547 --> 41:06.884
There's only one thing
that I can do, Agent Mulder.

41:07.801 --> 41:10.846
As of right now,
I'm reopening the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>.

41:13.307 --> 41:15.767
That's what they fear the most.

41:45.255 --> 41:48.050
Agent Mulder?
Thank you for calling me.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.344
I'm sorry I don't
have better news.

41:50.385 --> 41:52.679
Do you know something?
Is Dana okay?

41:52.721 --> 41:55.390
I don't know
anything more about it.

41:58.268 --> 42:00.729
I know you're doing
all you can.

42:14.284 --> 42:18.121
I had that dream again last night,
about Dana being taken away.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.917
I can't tell you
how it scares me.

42:23.627 --> 42:27.047
It's probably scarier
when you stop having the dream.

42:29.758 --> 42:31.552
Don't you think?

42:52.656 --> 42:54.408
I found this.

42:56.952 --> 43:00.205
That's something I...
I never considered about her.

43:01.665 --> 43:04.543
If she was...
If she was such a skeptic...

43:06.461 --> 43:08.505
why did she wear that?

43:12.467 --> 43:15.262
I gave it to her
on her 15th birthday.

43:23.854 --> 43:26.064
Don't you want to keep it?

43:36.992 --> 43:39.745
When you find her,
You give it to her.
