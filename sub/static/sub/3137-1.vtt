00:44.960 --> 00:47.008
- What do I get out of it?
- Emma, you don't get

00:47.160 --> 00:48.924
to ask that question at 13 years of age.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.570
You have duties, live with it.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.882
Why do I have to go before and after school?

00:53.040 --> 00:54.371
Yeah, why does she have to go before and after?

00:54.520 --> 00:57.524
Because Mom is 79 and not quite the full shilling anymore.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.045
Whoops!
Calculator in the corn flakes.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.685
God, just bring her her bloody paper

01:00.840 --> 01:02.888
and milk and stop moaning about it, will ya?

01:03.280 --> 01:04.644
Once I get some new stock I'll be fine.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.610
- The problem's just cash flow.
- Just get it from the bank.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.602
They're not lending.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.843
You can't all go on borrowing money from me indefinitely.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.162
Mmm, from us indefinitely.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.488
From me indefinitely.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.442
- Mom!
- What?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.447
I don't have time to make you gourmet lunches, Emma.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.489
This is embarrassing.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.675
Just take a bite of the banana

01:25.800 --> 01:26.881
and then a bite of the bread.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.530
That's what we used to have.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.411
- You tell her.
- Last time, I promise.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.891
And what happens when you can't pay me back?

01:33.040 --> 01:35.486
I'll pay you back.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.211
I'll have to give you a check.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.847
- What?
- She's old and weird

01:41.000 --> 01:44.129
and only ever wants to argue about things.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.566
Can't argue with that.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.842
Thanks, sis, you're a lifesaver.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.169
Your mom is well able to look after herself.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.483
She could come and live with us instead.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.966
Do as your mother tells you.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.645
No.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.046
Thank you, dear.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.323
You're welcome.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.085
Mom!

02:39.520 --> 02:40.760
Mom!

02:41.280 --> 02:43.408
Come on, Mom, will you help?

02:47.680 --> 02:49.364
Ask her where's my birth cert.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.689
What's he looking for now?

02:52.240 --> 02:54.686
- Birth cert.
- Where did you put it?

02:56.600 --> 02:58.489
I mean it's not like they don't know who I am.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.728
I've been going down there for nearly twenty years.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.364
I collect once a week.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.921
I sign on once a month.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.566
I mean, they have my signature.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.484
They have my picture!

03:10.640 --> 03:12.608
And what the hell is an annual review?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.570
They never used to have annual reviews.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.081
How can you live in this chaos, Mom?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.006
Tell him to take his time and he'll find it.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.766
I mean, who uses a birth cert for anything anymore anyway?

03:24.920 --> 03:26.445
I'm gonna be late.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.927
They're gonna make me do a whole new application.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.731
Then they're going to start
trying to train me to do things.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.562
Come on, where did you put it?

03:37.080 --> 03:40.607
- You put everything--
- He's not used to being up this early.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.364
Come on, Mom, will you help?

03:43.520 --> 03:45.204
I'm gonna lose me welfare!

03:45.840 --> 03:47.524
Did you put it in a drawer?

03:47.680 --> 03:49.330
Will you help me?!

03:50.640 --> 03:51.971
Mom!

05:30.160 --> 05:31.286
Des?

05:33.520 --> 05:35.602
- No job?
- Don't tell Mom.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.966
Don't mind her.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.168
If she'd listened to us and sold the house during the boom

05:39.320 --> 05:41.243
we'd all be in the south of France by now.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.886
- Hiya.
- Not you too?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.088
They cut me down to two days at the groomers.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.727
Don't tell Mom.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.689
Here, go on, will ya?

05:51.840 --> 05:53.569
- Huh?
- You're next.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.250
Relax, I'm talking here.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.562
Just get a move on, ya bleedin' culchie.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.964
I'm not a culchie.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.570
Nan?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.330
Nan?

07:05.120 --> 07:07.361
Nan?

07:44.240 --> 07:45.844
Nan!

07:46.480 --> 07:49.643
Huh?

08:00.360 --> 08:02.124
Eight bags, that's the lot.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.125
Emma?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.248
Check that this is on right.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.688
A hundred and sixty, there, please, Annie.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.810
They're safe enough there, love.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.564
Night, girls.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.162
Jesus!

08:22.320 --> 08:24.288
It's colder than a Norwegian's tit.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.001
- Oh, lovely, Colm.
- What?

08:27.160 --> 08:29.242
Did you put your rent in the jar?

08:29.440 --> 08:31.204
Yes, I did.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.562
I don't know what you need money for, anyway.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.690
I need you to do us a favor.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.524
Take Nan for a day out somewhere.

08:42.559 --> 08:43.607
Okay?

08:44.760 --> 08:46.489
Why?

08:46.640 --> 08:48.005
You can't tell her.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.647
Fine.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.640
I'm going to clean up the house.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.171
Does my mom know about it?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.924
I'm going to get her to help me.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.321
I just need to know we have our decoy first.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.651
- Fifty.
- Are you fucking serious?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.325
Take it or leave it.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.124
Get her out early and back late.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.530
And don't let on now.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.291
Can I not just want to hang out with my granny?

09:22.320 --> 09:24.687
I've been on the dart before.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.243
Your granddad took me out to Bray

09:27.400 --> 09:29.289
when they opened the line.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.530
Nineteen eighty-four.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.327
Anything from the last century doesn't count.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.570
Will I be back in time for Joe Duffy?

09:43.720 --> 09:46.041
I dunno. Is he coming
to the house?

09:46.200 --> 09:49.727
On the radio.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.041
- Two o'clock.
- We definitely won't be back.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.251
Are you cold?

10:02.400 --> 10:03.890
No, I'm all right.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.963
But you're a bit cold, aren't you?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.804
I'm grand.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.490
Just say you're cold.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.766
But I'm not.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.850
- Just say it.
- I'm freezing.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.487
Don't worry.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.449
I have just the thing for you.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.241
What do you think happens to you when you die?

10:48.680 --> 10:50.967
I don't think anything happens.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.331
Maybe coming back to life as someone else,

10:55.480 --> 10:58.290
like the president or some famous singer.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.087
Or a handicap or a homeless person.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.004
No.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.605
Or you come back as Colm.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.842
Aw, wreck the head.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.367
Something better than you are now.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.325
No such thing.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.131
Okay.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.486
Me...

11:15.640 --> 11:18.450
except... I'm younger

11:18.960 --> 11:21.691
- and I can fly.
- Seriously.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.526
It's not a conversation to be taken seriously.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.843
Reincarnation is serious.
A lot of people believe in it.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.442
More wishful thinking.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.808
Surprise!

11:45.720 --> 11:48.769
It's not my birthday until next week.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.002
Special treat, Mom, ahead of your birthday...

11:51.160 --> 11:53.083
full house makeover.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.046
What?

11:56.200 --> 11:58.726
Everything of worth or sentimental value has been cleaned.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.486
Everything else has been repaired, replaced or upgraded.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.608
Fresh as a daisy.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.369
New toaster, new kettle.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.204
I cleaned the cooker.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.249
New digital TV service...

12:25.400 --> 12:28.324
No more crappy picture quality and you can record on it.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.050
It's like watching it back live.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.202
And, drumroll please...

12:35.280 --> 12:37.567
Whoa-aaa!

12:38.240 --> 12:40.163
Giant basket for your wool!

12:44.640 --> 12:46.404
Oh, look.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.733
We put these all around the house.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.002
Keep the old-folk stink away.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.729
Come on, Mom.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.885
New table.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.122
And you can see yourself in the mirror now.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.085
Where's everything gone?

13:33.240 --> 13:35.607
Three hundred and eighty-six
true crime novels,

13:35.760 --> 13:38.684
forty-six phone books,
twenty-two years of newspapers.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.089
Calendars, birthday and Christmas cards,
knitting patterns.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.481
Seven million Chinese
take-away menus.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.766
Eight million bus tickets.

13:45.920 --> 13:51.165
School books, first year
leaving certificate, 1954-1996.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.448
All sorts of other junk, too.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.165
All gone to recycling.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.481
Come on.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.969
Ta-dah!

14:20.440 --> 14:22.647
New shower curtains.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.088
Handles in the bath.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.768
- Oof!
- Oh, here.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.847
We cleared out some of the old furniture in my room.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.048
Oh, some nice improvements in there.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.407
In case you ever wanted to rent it out or whatever.

14:45.560 --> 14:46.971
You planning on moving out?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.565
No plan, no, but just in case.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.290
Keep your eyes closed, okay.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.920
Annie, you get the lights.
Straight across, okay.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.566
Don't open your eyes, Mom, wait for the big finale.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.166
Wait... okay.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.161
Ta-dah!

15:02.800 --> 15:04.564
New curtains, new carpet.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.121
Best of all, no more smelly old mattress.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.408
Brand-new bed,
lkea's finest,

15:09.560 --> 15:11.449
memory foam, orthopedic.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.763
Best night's kip ever.
We both got one.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.325
Where's the old one?

15:17.520 --> 15:20.490
Oh, yeah. We cleared out all
the crap from under the bed.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.888
You can see right through to the other side.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.361
Have a look!

15:26.520 --> 15:28.727
Much better feng shui!

15:30.960 --> 15:32.564
Where's it gone?

15:32.920 --> 15:35.810
Mom, you don't have to worry about it,

15:35.960 --> 15:38.850
- that's the point.
- Where is it?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.045
Why do you want to know?

15:44.480 --> 15:46.721
Because all my money was in it.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.045
Are you sure?

15:51.920 --> 15:54.844
Yes, Colm, I'm sure.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.611
How much?

15:58.440 --> 16:00.044
Nearly a million.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.486
I tell you what, Mom, you can still nail a punch line.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.926
Yeah, me small wit.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.491
A million bedbugs.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.810
A million euros.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.201
Ah, pull the other one, would you?

16:19.360 --> 16:21.249
How would you get a million euro?

16:26.240 --> 16:29.608
Selling off the garage at the end of the garden,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.367
rent from the basement flat,

16:33.040 --> 16:35.168
my inheritance,

16:35.880 --> 16:38.281
whatever your dad didn't drink,

16:38.600 --> 16:41.763
savings from teaching and my pension.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.046
Not quite a million,

16:43.200 --> 16:46.727
but fifty year's savings adds up.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.709
If you did have the money, Mom,

16:50.760 --> 16:52.285
why didn't you put it in the bank?

16:53.160 --> 16:56.164
Have you not been listening to the news?

16:56.400 --> 16:57.845
It was safe here.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.923
You could hold it in your hands.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.727
I didn't know you idiots were going
to come along and throw it out.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.929
You don't think she's serious, do you?

17:12.079 --> 17:13.888
She looked very serious to me.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.290
It went out the front with the rest, didn't it?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.521
- Yeah. Did the charity take it?
- No.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.800
How can you be so sure?

17:20.960 --> 17:22.803
They don't take beds or bedding.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.361
- So it's gone to the dump?
- Well, what did it look like?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.528
- What color was it?
- What did it look like, Mom?

17:27.680 --> 17:31.002
- It was blue.
- It was cream and blue...

17:31.160 --> 17:34.881
with the letters A-Q-P
printed on it.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.371
It went out with everything else.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.806
Who was the van driver?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.610
Just a lad I know.
He drinks up in the hill.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.081
- Ring him.
- I don't have his number.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.208
Oh Jesus, Colm, you and your bloody schemes.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.250
I told you to organize a professional waste service.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.720
Wait a minute.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.207
Whoever we gave it to would have taken it away the same.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.567
In fact, if they were professional,

17:52.720 --> 17:55.485
it would already be incinerated by now.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.530
The guy I got to do it is probably up in the pub

17:58.720 --> 18:01.690
with everything still sitting in the back of his van.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.850
Where are we going?

18:10.280 --> 18:11.884
Come on, come on.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.362
Where are we going?

18:15.840 --> 18:16.887
What about Nan?

18:17.040 --> 18:19.361
- I'll take her.
- Come on.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.807
Come on.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.880
To be honest, I'm not sure I believe any of this.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.725
I mean, you must have changed
your mattress over all those years.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.642
Four times.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.370
When the euro came in,

18:54.520 --> 18:59.128
I took pounds to the bank every day for six months.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.810
And when were you going to tell us

19:00.960 --> 19:02.644
about these extensive savings?

19:03.360 --> 19:05.124
I wasn't going to tell you.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.604
It must be a wind-up.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.289
Maybe she's in shock after we threw out all her junk.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.041
Can you actually imagine

19:16.200 --> 19:18.851
if there was a million
euro in it? Ha.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.201
Jim? Arthur in?

19:25.360 --> 19:27.283
Yeah, he's sitting there.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.648
See if we can grab his keys from on the bar.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.321
- Was he there?
- No.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.845
Might have gone out for a smoke.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.168
Didn't see him outside.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.529
Jeez, that's brutal, isn't it?

19:53.680 --> 19:56.047
- Three-nil.
- Yeah.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.887
Give us a packet of them crisps there, will you, Jim?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.809
What do you want Arthur for?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.644
Nothing.
Just looking for him.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.482
Aw, fuck it, Jim.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.366
Bollocks!

20:25.520 --> 20:27.010
What the hell are you doing?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.328
- Get out of that van.
- Sorry, Arthur.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.605
We threw out something that Mother wanted to keep.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.449
We thought you might still have it in the van.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.204
You'd want to wise up.

20:35.920 --> 20:36.921
Sorry.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.850
Where did you dump it?

20:42.520 --> 20:45.763
Aw, come on, man.
I apologized, okay?

20:47.320 --> 20:48.890
Gimme me keys.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.404
Where did you offload it?

20:53.760 --> 20:55.842
The recycling depot in Ring's End.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.085
Okay.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.890
Okay, great.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.849
Thanks, Arthur.
Cheers.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.845
I'll make it up to you!

21:05.000 --> 21:06.889
I'll buy you a pint, right?

21:11.480 --> 21:14.051
- Should we climb over?
- What if there's a guard dog?

21:14.200 --> 21:16.282
Why would they be guarding a load of rubbish?

21:16.440 --> 21:18.010
It's worth a lot.
You'd be surprised.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.650
They sell it to the Chinese.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.922
I wonder how much they pay for old mattresses.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.080
Well, are we going to do something or what?

21:24.240 --> 21:27.050
- I'm not getting over that.
- Needn't bother.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.646
Everything's cleared. They must
have already sent it on.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.007
Where, Colm, to where have they sent it?

21:32.160 --> 21:33.764
Some sort of sorting facility I suppose.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.604
You suppose.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.081
I'll go in and talk to them in the morning.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.402
- Monday morning.
- It's a bank holiday.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.971
Tuesday morning.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.445
Don't worry, Colm will find it on Tuesday.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.645
Colm is sick.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.165
He couldn't find a wife or a job.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.607
How's he going to find my life savings?

21:52.280 --> 21:54.806
All right, go on!

21:57.040 --> 21:59.691
- He will.
- Mmm.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.450
Oh, oh!

22:01.600 --> 22:03.284
- God help me!
- I'll hold you.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.970
Get your hands off me arse.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.610
- Do you want help or not?
- Bollocks!

22:27.520 --> 22:29.488
I hate Sundays.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.042
Why do you want it back?

22:39.280 --> 22:41.806
It's got sentimental value.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.843
Dad used to sleep on it with her.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.129
Oh.
Happy memories, huh?

22:49.280 --> 22:52.090
Just let it go, love.
It'll be filthy by now.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.083
It'll be no use to you.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.006
Yeah, she's superstitious, too.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.202
Probably easiest just to find it.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.681
Oh.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.045
Well, if you put it in the right container,

23:10.240 --> 23:13.005
It's probably gone to landfill via the depot by now.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.004
People put mattresses

23:15.200 --> 23:17.521
all over the shop here.
Rubble, timber,

23:17.680 --> 23:20.286
damaged furniture,
pre-loved furniture.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.771
Reusable.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.448
Either way it's probably gone to the landfill.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.923
I thought this was a recycling center.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.889
It's practically impossible to recycle a mattress.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.405
They're indestructible yokes.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.244
You put them in the shredder...

23:33.400 --> 23:36.244
and they're likely to pop out the other side intact.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.447
The pickarinos try to get the steel
out of the springs sometimes,

23:40.480 --> 23:42.323
but it's just not worth the effort.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.204
Well, where the hell do we start?

23:45.920 --> 23:47.331
Gerry!

23:47.480 --> 23:50.529
If it did go to the landfill, how would we find it?

23:52.200 --> 23:54.407
- Jump up and down.
- Pardon?

23:54.560 --> 23:55.802
Well, you wouldn't be able to see it

23:55.960 --> 23:58.247
'cause they cover everything up really quick.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.165
Unless they leave the corner sticking up or something.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.125
But you can usually tell by the feel of it

24:04.280 --> 24:08.842
there's a mattress in
the ground 'cause it's soft, springy.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.363
Starts right over there.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.490
Just gotta go in.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.248
There's this whole section here.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.641
That's all fresh stuff just coming in now.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.683
So, see, if we go up to the office...

25:16.240 --> 25:17.924
Lift up that brown one.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.851
- We're trying to lift it.
- Just push it.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.724
Yeah.
Fuck off.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.724
Whoo!
Trick or treat!

25:33.080 --> 25:34.570
Awww!

25:35.920 --> 25:38.491
. - Arrrgh!

26:03.880 --> 26:07.009
What are you looking at?

26:07.440 --> 26:08.726
What are you doing?

26:32.080 --> 26:33.605
Where's that county map?

26:33.760 --> 26:36.161
I'm going to start looking up landfills.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.683
Some kids just robbed the shed out of the garden.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.604
Let them have it.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.649
We never used it for anything anyway.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.887
Look, I know the scene.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.402
There is probably about a hundred of the little fuckers.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.562
I'm not going to go after them, take it off them,

26:59.760 --> 27:01.760
then try and drag it back up the street and over the wall,

27:01.880 --> 27:04.406
with them all chucking stones at me and calling me names.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.602
Just let them do their gathering.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.890
Stop!

27:14.040 --> 27:15.565
Wait a second, you!

27:16.320 --> 27:17.481
Guys?

27:17.920 --> 27:19.081
Stop!

27:21.240 --> 27:24.528
Hey! Hey! Hey, did yous take
a blue mattress from outside?

27:24.680 --> 27:26.045
Shut up, you!

27:26.200 --> 27:27.752
Look, come here, I don't care about the shed.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.081
Did you take a mattress from down outside?

27:29.240 --> 27:31.129
Do you want a dig in the head, do you?

27:31.600 --> 27:33.887
Come on, lads.
Come on, lads!

27:35.440 --> 27:36.441
Come on, boys!

27:36.600 --> 27:39.331
Quick! Quick! Quick!

27:50.920 --> 27:54.606
Here. Did you see anyone
put a mattress in there?

27:54.760 --> 27:57.570
Here, take your hands off him!

27:57.720 --> 28:00.166
Mary, some fuckin' weirdo's at your son.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.408
No, no, no.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.528
Mary!

28:06.320 --> 28:08.084
Look here, mister.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.850
I'll knock the bollocks off you!

28:10.040 --> 28:11.405
You pedo!

28:11.560 --> 28:14.291
I'll tear strips off you and feed them to the dog!

28:28.640 --> 28:31.041
It either went in the fire or went in the recycling.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.645
Unless that fella in the pub

28:35.800 --> 28:38.087
didn't send it to the recycling.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.562
What?

28:41.560 --> 28:43.369
If he was lying.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.286
About what?

28:45.440 --> 28:48.284
Sending it to the recycling.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.283
And why'd you think that?

28:50.880 --> 28:53.247
Well, you could sort of tell, couldn't you?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.170
Well, why didn't you say anything?

28:55.320 --> 28:57.482
You never listen to me anyway.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.971
Jesus.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.325
Annie, I'm borrowing the car.
I'll drop it back to you later.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.681
I've got the keys.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.084
Eh, come on, get in.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.163
Ah, for flip sake, a ball.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.924
Here, hold that.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.685
Go on, you get in.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.962
You didn't go to the recycling center at all, did you?

29:24.560 --> 29:26.449
Tread lightly, Colm.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.848
How much do they charge for a van?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.765
Colm, you gave me 60 quid to get rid of it for you.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.764
That doesn't buy you the right to ask
how I can make that profitable.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.167
I'll give you another 20 if you
tell me where you dumped it.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.970
What do you want to know so much for?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.482
Because the thing's had sentimental value.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.563
It just looked like old rubbish to me.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.931
Fifty.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.604
You're showing your hand now, Colm.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.964
How much do you want to tell us where it is?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.761
Well, that's a big question, me dear.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.291
I think maybe knowing Colm as I do,

29:59.480 --> 30:01.050
he wouldn't be this motivated to look for something

30:01.200 --> 30:05.125
just because his poor old Mommy
had some sentimental attachment.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.687
I'd say you've thrown out something of monetary value.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.969
A ring maybe, in a drawer?
An antique?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.850
And you're willing to pay up to nearly that value

30:13.040 --> 30:15.281
as long as it's still an oyster laying there for you.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.761
So, until you tell me what's up there,

30:17.960 --> 30:20.122
I can't give you a price now, can I?

30:20.280 --> 30:23.523
- Up where?
- Tsk, tsk, tsk!

30:23.680 --> 30:27.082
Why don't you think about what your price is

30:27.240 --> 30:29.481
and we'll call you in the morning.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.682
Hold on a second,
he's just taking--

30:31.840 --> 30:33.365
Shut up, Colm.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.765
Okay?

30:36.240 --> 30:37.844
Yeah.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.648
Call me in the morning and we'll work it out.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.108
I'm going to call you
at 10:00 in the morning, Arthur.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.804
You better answer.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.887
What the hell are you doing?
You totally let him off the hook.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.686
Oh, Jesus, Colm, can you not do anything right?

30:57.840 --> 30:59.604
You should stay out of it.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.125
I could have done a deal with him.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.408
Huh. You have
your dad's brains.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.251
That's the best I can say about you.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.681
I think I'll keep the car till the morning, will I?

31:15.840 --> 31:17.729
I don't fancy walking home from Annie's now.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.045
- We're not going home.
- We're not?

31:23.920 --> 31:25.922
Do you see that white van?

31:26.200 --> 31:27.964
Yes, I see the white van.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.645
I see that van in my sleep.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.326
I'm fecking haunted by that white van.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.690
Follow it.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.166
Mom, you're a genius.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.288
How did you crack that?

31:42.680 --> 31:45.604
After so many years, I've gotten to know

31:45.760 --> 31:50.209
how opportunistic chancers like that think.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.369
Like Colm.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.207
Where the hell's he going?

32:51.760 --> 32:54.491
Lovely friends you have, Colm.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.004
This is where you go to bury a body,
not dump old furniture.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.888
I hate Halloween.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.849
We have him now.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.088
The dirty, lying head on you, Arthur.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.969
People are going to hear about this.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.610
Relax, will you?
I was just worried somebody

33:33.760 --> 33:35.410
might have overheard us in the pub.

33:35.560 --> 33:36.721
How would ya know where to look?

33:36.880 --> 33:39.281
Eh, everybody dumps shit along this stretch.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.528
There were a load of gypos made a mess of it.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.364
It's not here.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.724
So it's a mattress you're after?

33:46.920 --> 33:49.127
Where's the fucking
mattress, Arthur? It's not here.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.203
What?
Was there something in it?

33:51.360 --> 33:53.169
- Money?
- Where did you put it?

33:53.320 --> 33:54.560
I threw everything out here,

33:54.760 --> 33:56.046
yours and another load.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.850
Definitely some mattresses in it,

33:58.000 --> 33:59.570
but it's all been moved around.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.444
Maybe the gypos were rootin' through it,

34:01.640 --> 34:03.085
or the corpo took it.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.969
They'll be up in the morning, we should ask them.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.724
How much was in it?

34:06.880 --> 34:08.723
Arthur, if you ask me that again

34:08.880 --> 34:10.848
I'm going to punch you in the face.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.645
Do you believe in hell?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.563
I do.

34:19.719 --> 34:21.324
It's living with Colm.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.891
That's a fucking bed bottom, sure.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.489
What are you doing?

34:39.719 --> 34:41.370
Can you even drive?

34:41.520 --> 34:44.842
Oh, I drove your granddad's car a few times...

34:46.920 --> 34:49.047
on Dollymount Strand.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.845
Take that, Colm, you dope!

35:25.040 --> 35:26.565
Hi, Mom!

35:26.720 --> 35:28.245
- Hi, Mom.
- Say hi, everyone.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.640
- Hello!
- Hello!

35:29.800 --> 35:31.564
Oh, look, there's Michael.

35:31.720 --> 35:34.200
I don't think I've ever seen those gloves on him before.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.482
And here is Colm,

35:36.640 --> 35:39.849
lifting... lifting a box!

35:40.000 --> 35:41.729
- It's a box of wool.
- It happens to be heavy.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.325
It's a heavy box of wool!

35:43.480 --> 35:46.563
You're not supposed to be
lifting anything. Here.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.604
Jesus, Colm!

35:50.760 --> 35:52.842
Don't just feck it into the box!

35:53.040 --> 35:55.725
You're supposed to wrap and pack, wrap and pack.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.922
Oh, it's a teasmade!

35:58.080 --> 36:00.321
Oh, Jesus!

36:00.480 --> 36:02.528
- Your side now, Des.
- Yeah.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.768
- Easy. Easy!
- Sorry about that.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.241
You're not directing it, you're
either helping or you're not.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.890
- I'm helping!
- Oh, come on.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.407
Oh, for fuck sake, seriously, what are you doing?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.011
Just checking me teeth.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.731
Cleaning your teeth?

36:16.240 --> 36:17.730
Yeah, no, I--
Yeah, I understand that,

36:17.880 --> 36:19.644
but how many mattresses can you get in a day?

36:21.120 --> 36:22.326
And do you recycle?

36:24.480 --> 36:26.244
Hi, uh, just wait a sec.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.651
What's the area that you cover?

36:29.800 --> 36:31.450
Mom, do you have money for the pizzas?

36:31.600 --> 36:33.967
- I never ordered pizzas.
- Colm did.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.566
- Well, let Colm pay for them.
- He's on the phone, I think.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.961
- He'll be down for you in a minute.
- Okay.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.929
He gave me 50 percent off vouchers.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.128
He said get one of yous to pay for the other half.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.805
The other half?

36:44.960 --> 36:46.450
Cheeky bollocks.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.608
What are yous doing?

36:53.320 --> 36:54.731
We're just...

36:54.880 --> 36:56.120
Planning something.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.570
What is it, a treasure hunt?

36:58.720 --> 37:00.609
Excuse me.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.000
It's a family matter, okay?

37:02.160 --> 37:03.685
Can you wait out in the hall, please?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.401
Yeah, okay.
Sorry.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.611
Jesus.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.801
Hello?

37:15.040 --> 37:17.247
We're going to have to start
being more discreet about this.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.323
- Shush!
- Don't shush me, Michael.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.647
I thought it might have been burnt,

37:23.840 --> 37:25.729
but I went around this morning and there's no sign

37:25.880 --> 37:27.122
of any mattress springs or anything,

37:27.240 --> 37:29.049
so it's out there somewhere.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.168
- What's he doing?
- Colm, can you--

37:31.320 --> 37:33.049
Dublin Corporation said they might have cleared it

37:33.200 --> 37:35.282
to landfill, but it's impossible to know.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.323
So, it's a blue mattress?

37:37.520 --> 37:39.887
Yes, Joe, cream and blue, and we'll pay a reward

37:40.040 --> 37:42.646
of 50,000 euro to anyone who can help us find it.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.485
- Colm, hang up the phone!
- Colm!

37:45.640 --> 37:47.051
- Hang up the phone!
- Hello?

37:47.240 --> 37:49.322
Colm, are you still with us there?
We seem to have lost Colm.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.642
Hello, Colm? He's gone.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.609
It was the best idea any of us have had.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.491
Why don't you ask someone before
you do these things, Colm?

37:56.640 --> 37:59.086
It's all of our money in that
mattress, it's not just yours.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.164
- Idiot.
- Don't call me an idiot.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.084
Oh God, would you listen to this?

38:04.240 --> 38:05.401
Why would I give this fella back that money

38:05.560 --> 38:07.324
for 50 grand when I could just keep the lot?

38:07.480 --> 38:09.084
If it's in the tip, it's finders keepers.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.208
Ah, now just hang on for two secs.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.125
This is his elderly mother's
life savings we're talking about.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.039
You wouldn't just keep them for yourself, would you?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.834
She didn't find it necessary to spend it before now.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.081
What's changed?

38:19.240 --> 38:20.861
I've been out of work for nearly two year, Joe.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.645
I've got two kids to feed, me wife's on disability

38:23.800 --> 38:25.928
and I've got a gas bill that's going through the roof.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.605
A million euro for putting a peg on me nose?

38:27.760 --> 38:29.091
Yes, please.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.771
Des says there's only six landfills that it could be in.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.400
So if we do one a day, do them well,

38:38.560 --> 38:40.403
worst case scenario is we'll have it in a week.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.485
It's better that you're here, Mom.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.563
You know what it looks like on a subconscious level.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.081
You'll probably see it out of the corner of your eye.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I think you should have to search these places by yourself

38:51.120 --> 38:52.929
for being such a dope.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.321
You're some cheeky little wagon, do you know that?

38:55.520 --> 38:58.126
I mean, where do you get off calling
me a dope at 12 years of age?

38:58.280 --> 39:00.851
She's 13.
Don't talk to her like that.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.606
Thirteen and she thinks she knows everything.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.208
God, this looks busy.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.289
Shit.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.730
Bollocks.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.806
That mattress has my name on it.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.361
I'm not going home until I find that money.

41:07.280 --> 41:11.001
There he is now. Ah.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.889
Buy him an old pint there, Jim, will you?

41:13.040 --> 41:15.361
Sure didn't he throw it all away.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.204
Give us your autograph on that, will you?

41:28.720 --> 41:30.370
Around a million euro.
What?

41:30.520 --> 41:33.285
Why didn't you check the mattress?

41:33.440 --> 41:35.841
Um, what if someone robbed it?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.370
We've all been following the story this week

41:39.520 --> 41:41.841
of the missing mattress with
a million euros stashed in it.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.161
People up and down the country

41:43.320 --> 41:45.368
have been eagerly searching their local dumps

41:45.560 --> 41:47.722
in hope of finding
Mrs. Annie Small's loot.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.087
Annie's been good enough to join us

41:49.120 --> 41:50.531
in The Late Late Show audience tonight.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.163
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Annie.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.764
It's also a big week
for you birthday-wise.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.604
What age are you going to be tomorrow?

41:58.760 --> 42:00.842
I'm going to be 80.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.805
Well, the good news you'll be delighted to hear

42:04.000 --> 42:06.606
is that in a poll
on the R.T.E. website

42:07.280 --> 42:11.171
ninety-one percent of people said
that if they found the mattress

42:11.320 --> 42:14.529
they'd settle for the reward and give the rest back.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.523
Hey, pizza guy!

42:26.720 --> 42:28.210
Come in, have a beer.
Don't be shy.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.807
- Close the door.
- What's that?

42:31.000 --> 42:32.923
Open it, Mom.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.890
- Huh?
- It's a wool winder.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.085
Hurry up, he's here.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.685
Yeah, okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

42:43.880 --> 42:46.804
Forty-fifth-- Oh, jeez.
One, two, three, four...

42:47.880 --> 42:49.291
You look lovely, Mom.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.807
Well, you gave me a little bit of notice this time.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.606
Yeah, we didn't think you needed any more surprises.

43:00.480 --> 43:03.211
- Where is the fire?

43:07.480 --> 43:11.007
I hear there is
a smoking-hot lady in here

43:11.160 --> 43:12.810
in need of a good hose.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.008
Over here!

43:15.280 --> 43:17.282
Oh, yeah!

43:17.640 --> 43:18.926
Come here, Annie.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.686
Mmm, you dirty little minx.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.681
- Ahhh!
- Oh, Jesus.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.527
Ahhh!

43:35.240 --> 43:36.526
- Whoo!
- Look at.

43:36.720 --> 43:39.530
Whoo, yeah.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.244
Whoo whoo whoo!

43:49.240 --> 43:50.924
Fire!

43:51.080 --> 43:52.764
Fire! Fire!

43:58.160 --> 44:00.606
Ahh. Ohh.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.046
Oh, Jesus.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.369
Fire! Fire! Fire!

44:22.120 --> 44:29.129
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

44:29.280 --> 44:33.922
♪ Happy birthday, dear Mom ♪

44:34.080 --> 44:38.483
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

44:38.840 --> 44:40.763
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Fire safety first.

44:40.920 --> 44:41.967
That's a lot of candles, love.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.487
Mind your hair now. We don't want
to torch the blue rinse.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.329
No! No, no, no, no!

45:09.320 --> 45:11.448
Hey, come on. I don't take off
my clothes for free.

45:11.640 --> 45:15.167
- Yeah, we need to get paid, man.
- Everybody throw in.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.288
- I don't have anything.
- Seriously?

45:17.480 --> 45:19.403
I made the cake.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.688
- I bought the beer.
- I put up the decorations.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.810
- I made you a good show?
- Yeah, you were deadly.

45:24.960 --> 45:26.689
Don't eat any more cake, love.
You'll be sick.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.887
Margaret, can you chip in to pay these guys?

45:30.080 --> 45:31.650
Yeah, of course.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.970
- How much are you short?
- 350.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.565
Are you serious?!

45:41.640 --> 45:43.608
When are yous gonna grow up?

45:43.800 --> 45:45.456
Take it out of the mattress when we get it back.

45:45.480 --> 45:47.960
Oh, I will, thanks, Colm, yeah.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.971
I don't have 350.
I'll have to write you a check.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.884
- What?
- Nan wants you.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.049
- For what?
- The lotto.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.643
- What day is it?
- Wednesday.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.643
Oh, shite.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.564
I never got a ticket.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.848
- What's the jackpot?
- Four and a half million.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.327
- Oh, shite.
- Nan got tickets.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.769
- Did she?
- Yeah.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.402
It's on now.

46:21.560 --> 46:22.971
Oh ho ho, if you're not in,

46:23.120 --> 46:24.849
you can't win.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.122
I can't believe you didn't get me one.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.851
I always get you one.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.173
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Ella...

46:39.280 --> 46:42.045
Sorry. Here,
you can have this one.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.725
No, go on.
It's yours.

46:43.880 --> 46:46.042
Well, if we win, we'll split it.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.242
Not at all.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.289
I had a dream we won.

46:51.320 --> 46:52.128
Did you?

46:52.280 --> 46:53.486
Yeah, with these numbers.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.449
When I woke up
I wrote them out and--

46:55.600 --> 46:58.206
Okay, ho ho, shush shush.
It's coming on.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.250
So check those tickets carefully,
and the best of luck to all of you.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.724
Jesus, she's gorgeous, isn't she?

47:03.920 --> 47:07.163
The first ball in tonight's lotto is number 20.

47:07.320 --> 47:10.403
- Any luck there, Mom?
- I don't think so.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.289
- No.
- ...number 23.

47:12.440 --> 47:13.805
No, wait.

47:13.960 --> 47:15.928
- I got them.
- ...and we have number 14.

47:16.080 --> 47:19.129
- Both of them?
- I have 14, too.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.089
You got three numbers?

47:21.240 --> 47:22.241
You got three numbers!

47:22.440 --> 47:24.568
...followed by number one.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.041
And one!

47:26.200 --> 47:28.567
You got four numbers, Mom!
You got four numbers!

47:28.720 --> 47:30.563
Oh, shush shush shush.
What did she say?

47:30.720 --> 47:32.290
- What did she say?
- 16.

47:32.440 --> 47:33.885
We have five numbers!

47:34.080 --> 47:35.127
That's about a quarter of a million!

47:35.280 --> 47:39.729
We just need one more.
Come on, the six numbers!

47:39.880 --> 47:42.121
And the sixth ball is number 25.

47:50.160 --> 47:52.811
And the bonus ball is number 20.

47:57.800 --> 48:00.326
Whoo whoo!
Mom!

48:00.520 --> 48:02.045
Mom, you fucking did it!

48:02.200 --> 48:04.521
You fucking did it!

48:11.640 --> 48:13.927
Oh, Ella, I knew you'd have something good for me.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.804
Tonight's winning numbers...

48:18.800 --> 48:20.564
Hold on, hold on.
Double check.

48:20.720 --> 48:21.881
Double check.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.446
Whoo! I knew!

48:29.600 --> 48:31.648
I knew we wouldn't be poor forever!
I told you!

48:31.840 --> 48:34.286
Are you sure you got them right?

48:34.440 --> 48:36.169
Yeah!
I checked them twice.

48:36.320 --> 48:39.005
- We have them all.
- What do you mean "we"?

48:39.160 --> 48:41.481
I thought you said the ticket was mine

48:41.640 --> 48:43.688
and that you wouldn't split it?

48:43.840 --> 48:45.444
Huh?

48:47.840 --> 48:49.171
Well, if it's yours,

48:49.360 --> 48:52.250
you're going to have to share it with the rest of them.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.728
It's me and you, Mommy.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.882
The lotto's always been me and you.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.162
Are you sure you got the numbers?

49:01.840 --> 49:04.730
- Huh?
- Maybe you should watch it again.

49:06.880 --> 49:09.008
Watch it again just to be sure.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.409
And now let's play lotto...

49:12.560 --> 49:14.050
It's good, isn't it?

49:14.200 --> 49:17.249
Digital television, just like watching it live.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.085
You were recording it?

49:20.240 --> 49:22.891
Oh yeah, we recorded this ages ago.

49:30.520 --> 49:33.729
"I knew. I knew we wouldn't
be poor forever!"

49:35.200 --> 49:38.363
It was last week's draw, you dummy.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.202
So we didn't win?

49:41.360 --> 49:43.522
We bought a ticket with numbers

49:43.680 --> 49:45.330
from last week's draw,

49:45.480 --> 49:47.528
just to wind you up.

49:51.480 --> 49:54.051
All I want is to be allowed to live
with a little bit of dignity.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.204
That's funny, is it?

49:57.360 --> 49:59.328
To want socks with no holes in them,

49:59.480 --> 50:01.323
money to get a little car,

50:01.480 --> 50:03.289
and not to have to live with my mother all my life

50:03.440 --> 50:05.841
with everyone laughing at me.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.162
Yous are a shower of bastards.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.489
And coming up after the break,

50:17.640 --> 50:19.483
cash-strapped locals in Kildare

50:19.680 --> 50:21.728
find the missing mattress everyone's been looking for,

50:21.880 --> 50:23.777
and how Waterford hurlers are preparing for Sunday's...

50:23.920 --> 50:26.321
They found it.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.929
They found it in Kildare!

50:37.680 --> 50:39.284
You stupid.

50:47.280 --> 50:50.489
The infamous mattress containing the missing life savings

50:50.640 --> 50:54.042
of 79-year-old retired
schoolteacher Annie Small

50:54.200 --> 50:57.443
was discovered here at the Ballybeg
waste processing center

50:57.600 --> 51:00.763
outside of Celbridge.
Local man Graham Gaffney

51:00.920 --> 51:02.649
was surprised to find the sum of money

51:02.800 --> 51:04.643
hidden inside the mattress was not

51:04.800 --> 51:07.610
quite as substantial as many had been led to believe.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.762
Graham, what exactly did you find?

51:09.960 --> 51:12.440
When I saw the first few notes I knew straightaway

51:12.600 --> 51:14.250
that was it.
And, uh...

51:14.400 --> 51:16.448
I was dancing, Joe.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.011
And two of the other lads

51:18.160 --> 51:20.481
helped me drag it down into the yard.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.603
I offered them 10 grand each
for their trouble like, you know?

51:22.760 --> 51:25.206
And we cut it up and...
let me put it to you this way:

51:25.360 --> 51:27.886
there wasn't 20 grand there
for the lads like, far from it.

51:28.040 --> 51:29.610
How much did you get, Graham?

51:29.760 --> 51:32.001
670 euros,

51:32.160 --> 51:33.685
mostly in fivers.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.649
And are you disappointed, Graham?

51:35.800 --> 51:37.800
Well, I did see her on The Late Late Show with me own eyes

51:37.920 --> 51:40.526
and she did say a million, so I felt a bit cheated,

51:40.680 --> 51:42.045
to be honest with you.

51:42.240 --> 51:44.322
But 670 euros

51:44.480 --> 51:46.608
are not bad for a day's work

51:46.760 --> 51:47.921
in the tip.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.361
Better than a slap in the face with a wet fish.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.929
There was at least 900,000 euros

52:00.080 --> 52:01.206
In that mattress.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.448
Aw, for God's sake.
Give it up, will you?

52:03.640 --> 52:07.884
- I know what I had.
- You saved up 600 quid.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.485
And you know what?
Well done.

52:09.640 --> 52:13.122
- That's more than I ever saved.
- I know what I had.

52:13.280 --> 52:15.931
You don't remember things perfectly anymore.

52:16.080 --> 52:18.651
That's life.
Nobody's angry at you.

52:18.800 --> 52:21.531
Why should anybody be angry at me?

52:21.680 --> 52:24.001
You're the feckin' idiot who threw all my stuff out!

52:24.200 --> 52:27.329
Aw, Jesus. Turn it on me,
why don't you?

52:27.480 --> 52:30.404
Do you understand you've had us all on a wild goose chase?

52:30.560 --> 52:32.210
The whole country.

52:32.520 --> 52:35.922
Don't you say one more word to me, Colm.

52:42.560 --> 52:45.245
It's on the radio too.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.021
You get to an age where all you want to believe

52:47.160 --> 52:49.811
is the world still cares about you.
Tell me if I'm wrong, Adrian.

52:49.960 --> 52:52.804
And didn't she hit the jackpot with
this one, the attention she got?

52:52.960 --> 52:54.530
I mean the lunacy.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.967
Fifteen hundred people in one dump alone

52:57.120 --> 52:59.851
crawling over rats, looking
for a piss-stained mattress

53:00.000 --> 53:03.402
on the word of some mad old one for 600 euro?

53:03.560 --> 53:05.528
This country is bollocksed.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.364
I can't believe they put it in the main news.

53:12.520 --> 53:14.682
Everybody knows that was us.

53:14.840 --> 53:17.127
I always said this family would be famous.

53:17.280 --> 53:20.329
Yeah, fools for life.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.084
Are you all right?

53:37.520 --> 53:40.410
There weren't any stains on that mattress.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.330
Come back downstairs.

53:43.480 --> 53:44.891
Everyone's worried about you.

53:46.920 --> 53:49.764
Worried I'm not going to die soon enough.

54:16.240 --> 54:20.290
And how many milliliters of milk do we add?

54:20.600 --> 54:21.965
Emma?

54:22.720 --> 54:24.290
Um...

54:24.440 --> 54:25.965
Six hundred?

54:26.120 --> 54:27.884
Are you sure it's not closer to a million?

54:41.440 --> 54:44.046
Come on.
Hi, Mom.

54:44.440 --> 54:46.841
Come on, say hi to Nan, kids.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.526
- What are you doing?
- Did Colm not tell you?

54:49.720 --> 54:52.326
I'm just going to come home for a bit
while I get a new place organized.

54:52.480 --> 54:55.609
We'll set up in the good room.
You won't even know we're here.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.047
Hi.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.649
Just can't deal with that bastard bank anymore.

55:34.960 --> 55:36.530
Did you see this?

55:37.200 --> 55:38.531
Yeah.

55:40.920 --> 55:42.445
But did you see this?

55:50.200 --> 55:52.521
It isn't it.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.330
The color's right,

55:55.480 --> 55:57.369
but the pattern is different,

55:57.520 --> 56:00.524
and there's no label on the side.

56:02.680 --> 56:05.001
It's a different mattress.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.291
What?

56:09.080 --> 56:13.005
Don't tell anyone.

56:15.520 --> 56:18.330
The red pins had swarms of people

56:18.520 --> 56:19.885
looking through them.

56:20.040 --> 56:23.522
The blue pins are for places that were closed.

56:23.680 --> 56:26.684
The green ones don't take bulk waste.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.885
What are yous doing?

56:39.840 --> 56:41.569
Nothing.

56:47.640 --> 56:49.927
Where are yous going?

56:50.080 --> 56:51.809
Nowhere.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.962
Just out for the day.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.608
We should be near it now.

57:01.920 --> 57:04.287
Do you see a sign of any kind?

57:07.240 --> 57:09.402
No, it's more up there.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.403
No, it's here, it's here.

57:11.560 --> 57:12.971
No, it's up there.

57:13.120 --> 57:15.521
No, 'cause we were passing and then I saw the sign

57:15.680 --> 57:18.331
that said "swords" and it said like, 12km.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.641
No.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.646
What are you going to do with the money if we find it?

57:38.120 --> 57:40.327
When we find it.

57:42.360 --> 57:45.364
What are you going to do with the money when we find it?

57:46.240 --> 57:49.369
What are we going to do with it?

57:50.960 --> 57:53.611
What are we going to do with the money when we find it?

57:57.560 --> 57:59.164
Spend it.

58:07.520 --> 58:08.965
Hey!

58:09.120 --> 58:11.885
Yous aren't looking for a mattress, are you?

58:13.760 --> 58:15.000
They already found it.

58:18.520 --> 58:21.205
It was in the papers yesterday.

58:21.360 --> 58:23.283
There was only 600 quid in it.

58:50.440 --> 58:52.727
We'll have to leave
and get a bu--

58:52.920 --> 58:55.161
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.084
Come on, watch this now.

58:57.240 --> 58:59.447
Okay, so we'll get the bus here.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.805
There you go.

59:08.880 --> 59:11.167
Where have you been?!

59:13.640 --> 59:15.404
Just out for the day.

59:15.560 --> 59:16.925
- Shhhh.
- Don't shush me, Des.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.445
The kids.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.489
Everyone's been worried sick looking for you both.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.688
We didn't even know if you two were together.

59:24.680 --> 59:26.569
Well, we were.

59:26.760 --> 59:28.285
Good night.

59:34.360 --> 59:36.124
What the hell were you doing?

59:36.280 --> 59:38.362
Nothing.
Let's just go.

59:51.240 --> 59:52.571
What's this?

59:53.400 --> 59:54.606
Dunno.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.167
It's our map of the dumps.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.691
They found it.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.604
You saw it on the television.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.330
I know what's going on.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.448
Mom's had another senile turn,

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.648
and Emma, as usual, is humoring her.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.890
You're not doing her any favors by encouraging her.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.886
Come on, you've got school in the morning.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.520
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, that's lovely.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.200
A sure sign you're spending too much time with Colm.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.400
Look, it's one thing leading everyone up

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.130
the garden path with this mattress thing

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.607
and having the whole country laughing at us.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.050
But now she's turned Into a crazy old woman,

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.890
rooting around In rubbish tips.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.686
- I mean, enough is enough.
- I'm saving some money

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.604
now that I'm not paying my mortgage any more.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.366
Maybe I could chip in for a home or something.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.130
We can't put her in a home, guys.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.248
She's not leaving us much choice.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.324
Maybe you get a chance to go live your life again,

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.370
but you know all the mistakes you made

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.484
so you can do everything the right way second time around.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.526
Maybe you get a chance to live again,

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.401
but to do all the things you really wanted to do...

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.761
even if they're the wrong things.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.565
Maybe you get to go live your life again

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.922
and this time

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.449
you know what everybody else is thinking,

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.127
So you know if they're lying, or if they like you,

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.965
or they have some money hidden in their mattress

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.565
and they're not telling you.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.810
Trust me,

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.249
you wouldn't want to know what people are thinking.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.404
It's bad enough what comes out of their mouths.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.529
Maybe you get sent somewhere

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.445
where all the rubbish you ever threw out is all piled up

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.887
and you're stuck there until you clean it up.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.970
That's where your granddad is now,

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.329
picking fag butts and whiskey bottles

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.041
out of a giant mound of bookie slips.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.965
Why did you marry him If he was such a drunk?

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.642
He wasn't a drunk when I married him.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.281
Oh.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.287
Must have been me, huh?

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.680
No.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.770
Actually, probably was.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.051
We went down to Kerry on our honeymoon.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.363
There were barely even any roads there.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.130
But your granddad loved the country.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.162
His dad fought in the war of independence down there.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.930
He was always telling him stories

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.607
about fighting and hiding,

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.527
and sitting in pubs through the night planning ambushes.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.124
I was only complaining about the rain,

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.364
the cold and...

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.847
wanting to come home.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.442
But then one day he...

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.204
He took me up,

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.402
up onto the top of these cliffs

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.291
looking out on the Skellig Rock.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.527
It was like the edge of the world,

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.682
with the wind coming in off the Atlantic.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.286
I could hardly catch my breath.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.527
And he was shouting something to me over the wind.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.325
And I couldn't hear what he was saying.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.128
He was probably just saying it was time to go back, but...

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.523
I like to think...

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.081
He was saying that he loved me.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.884
I'll miss seeing what a great character

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.611
you turn out to be, Em.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.521
I'm disgusted.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.002
It's like leaving a party just when it's getting good.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.844
You can't.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.289
Eighty years...

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.922
there's no escaping it.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.047
Don't ever do that again-- Oh! oh!

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.725
- Stop it, I'm serious!
- How much per month?

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.804
- Get down from there.
- And that includes the knitting club?

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.203
- Yeah, for five days a week.
- Right, yeah yeah.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.607
And it says here
a "gated community."

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.140
You do that one more time, you're never
having that drink again, okay?

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.206
- She's beginning to wander a bit.
- Right, give me that.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.840
- Okay, I'll come back to you on that.
- Give it to me, will you?

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.849
Okay.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.565
Stop that.
You are in big trouble.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.643
You are in big trouble,
Young-- oh!

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.642
Young lady.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.962
Will you get down
from the table? Oh!

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.641
Get down from the table.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.047
Get down from the table now!

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.130
Maybe you didn't save up all that money

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.369
and the mattress they found was yours.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.008
Did you ever even consider that?

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.242
I'm senile, is that it?

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.481
No, just--
Maybe you made a mistake.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.968
In which case, at least we didn't
throw out a million quid.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.284
Go home.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.086
I'm not in the mood for babysitting you.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.404
Could you let us off here?

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.961
Yeah, no problem.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.490
Look, I'm not in the mood
for wind-ups.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.167
It's past a joke.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.002
Colm!

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.560
You got it, you got it!

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.449
You got it!
You got it, ha ha ha!

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.967
Whoa.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.368
Hiya.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.681
What?

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.887
What?!

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.044
Go harder!

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.922
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, mind, Colm!

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.921
- Stop!
- Got you.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.321
Ah, no.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.041
Mom.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.122
Mom?

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.926
There's some people at the door.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.570
They said they want to speak to you.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.404
What?

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.085
Stop it!

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.971
- Okay, come on.
- Mommy, I want to play with it.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.487
Stop!

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.441
Surprise!

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.449
Whoo-hoo!

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.211
What's wrong, Mom?
You're not happy?

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.130
There isn't really a million euros in it.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.680
I just said that so yous'd take me seriously.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.450
It's more like...

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.651
a few hundred thousand.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.606
Better than a slap in the face with a wet fish!

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.931
Out of the way.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.129
The mattress has landed.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.686
Pull it up there.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.080
Annie, don't...

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.730
Where did you get it?

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.290
Colm found it.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.289
Well done, son.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.485
Come on.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.122
- Who's going for champagne?
- Way ahead of you.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.362
Three bottles of the Bollinger, coming up!

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.727
Guys, it's Mom's money.
You can't start spending it.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.410
Oh stop, will you?
It's a drop in the ocean.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.086
That's exactly the reason
she didn't tell us in the first place.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.368
That's not the reason at all.
She was just keeping it

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.567
as a surprise.
Isn't that right, Mom?

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.569
Oh my God, yous are unbelievable.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.444
Shut up you, will you?
Can we not have 10 minutes

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.926
of fun without you judging us all the time?

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.525
Don't tell me to shut up, Colm.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.094
Spare me, Margaret.
You're coming in here,

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.486
you think you're that much above everyone else.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.051
It's not your money to spend.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.690
You just became the financial regulator for the family?

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.162
One of us has to be, but in this case
I'll make an exception.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.725
- Go get the champagne.
- Did you hear that, lads?

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.644
Get it quick before she changes her mind.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.768
Let's celebrate!

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.720
Whoo-hoo!
