00:17.200 --> 00:20.600
My name is John Fitzgerald Byers.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.300
I was named after our 35th president, ...

00:24.300 --> 00:28.500
...and I keep having this
beautiful dream.

00:29.300 --> 00:36.100
In my dream, the events of
November 22nd, 1963, never happened.

00:36.100 --> 00:40.800
In it, my namesake was
never assassinated.

00:42.100 --> 00:45.700
Other things are different, too,
in my dream.

00:45.700 --> 00:52.600
My country is hopeful and innocent;
young again. Young in spirit.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.400
My fellow citizens trust
their elect officials, ...

00:56.400 --> 00:59.900
...never once having been
betrayed by them.

00:59.900 --> 01:05.900
My government is truly "of the people,
by the people, for the people."

01:06.500 --> 01:11.900
All my hopes for my country,
for myself... all are fulfilled.

01:11.900 --> 01:17.800
I have everything a person could want:
home and family...

01:17.800 --> 01:20.400
...and love.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.500
Everything that counts for
anything in life...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.500
I have it.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.500
But the dream ends the
same way every time.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.600
I lose it all.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.400
The game is Texas Hold 'Em, gentlemen.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.700
Bring your wife?

03:02.700 --> 03:06.000
You think I'm sitting here,
I'd bring my wife?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Dumb ass brought his wife.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.700
'Cause I'm the man; I say I'm
playing poker, I play poker.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.800
Meanwhile, your wife is back
in Plano, boinking the mailman.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.400
- What's your name again?
- Funston. Stewart Funston.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.500
You bring a little lady, Stewart?

03:23.500 --> 03:28.100
- Not married.
- Smart man, hundred.

03:29.300 --> 03:34.900
- You's guys come to this every year? Def-con?
- Every year. Ah, fold.

03:34.900 --> 03:38.100
- Wouldn't miss it.
- Yeah. Out!

03:38.100 --> 03:43.000
So, you guys, uh, working on
anything interesting these days?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.700
Same old black ops crapola.
You know what it's like.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.500
Hey, we're doing some neat stuff
with neutron bombardment.

03:49.500 --> 03:54.500
Yeah, you can cook somebody's brain
in their skull, like hard-boiling an egg.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.700
It's neat stuff.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.900
Speaking of crapola... fold.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.600
Thank you.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.600
Oh... a man of distinction.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.200
- So you in, Mr. Funston?
- Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.900
Looks like it's just... you and me.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.200
Another 200.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.800
I'll see your 200...

04:33.800 --> 04:37.500
...and raise you one... thousand.

04:39.900 --> 04:45.800
- He's buying the pot stew.
- Three clubs showing... could be a flush.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.300
One thousand.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.900
And I raise you... one thousand.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.700
The stones he has...

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
I see you work for Conglomerate.
You guys make a great AE-135 unit.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.700
Oh man... don't freak...
don't freak. I'm on it.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.400
AE-135...

05:16.500 --> 05:22.000
Bingo. 442 J-stroke, A-135 air
conditioning units for B-2 bombers.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.900
- Talk air conditioners.
- Oh yeah, the AE-135 is a beauty.

05:27.900 --> 05:32.000
Keeps the B-2's frosty, can
practically see your breath.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.900
- How'd you get all the bugs out of it?
- Ah, you know, trade secrets.

05:36.900 --> 05:41.900
Oh, come on, Stewart.
You're among friends.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.100
Seriously, how'd you get
past the delamination thing?

05:46.100 --> 05:48.500
Delamination...

05:49.200 --> 05:51.900
- Searching.
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.900
I'll see your thousand...

06:00.500 --> 06:03.000
...and raise you...

06:03.000 --> 06:05.500
...all you've got.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.100
Systems tests, error
rates... nothing.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.100
Stall 'em.
And fold!

06:13.600 --> 06:18.000
You wanna know how we fixed
the delamination problem?

06:20.400 --> 06:25.300
We subcontracted the whole damn thing to the
Japanese, then triple-billed the government.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.300
Same thing we always do.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.000
Queen-high flush.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.000
King-high.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.900
Al, ...

06:46.900 --> 06:48.600
...call security.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.500
Have them pick up
Mr. "Funston" here.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.300
- And his partner.
- Delamination...

06:55.300 --> 06:59.400
- ...you made that up?
- My advice to you, "Stewart,"...

06:59.400 --> 07:04.800
...or whatever your name really
is; poker is not your game.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.300
Hey man, you wanna
thunderdome, let's go.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.600
Three thousand dollars...
I told you to fold.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.400
It should have been me in there playing,
why does Byers get to do the undercover?

07:23.400 --> 07:25.300
'Cause this ain't Woodstock.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.900
Did we at least get some usable
prints off the drink glasses?

07:27.900 --> 07:32.300
What, are you kidding?
We had to leave them all behind.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.200
- How we gonna salvage this?
- We're not.

07:35.200 --> 07:40.900
This convention's a bust. Five days and three
grand invested and we got bupkiss to show for it.

07:40.900 --> 07:45.200
Who was that player, anyway? The guy who
made us, he wasn't wearing a convention badge.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.700
- Nobody ever said his name.
- I think he's worth looking into.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.500
CIA, open up.

08:05.700 --> 08:09.900
- Jimmy and Timmy.
- Hey. Where were you guys today?

08:09.900 --> 08:13.600
- Around.
- Oh yeah? Maybe snooping for some hot 411?

08:13.600 --> 08:16.000
- On the sneak tip?
- Maybe...

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
- Yeah, well maybe we were too.
- And maybe we got some.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.700
Well maybe we did too.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.300
Ah, we got bupkiss.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.800
Buncha tight lipped
defense contractors.

08:30.800 --> 08:35.299
Yeah, well I'm gonna go way out on a
limb here and say, it's the t-shirt.

08:35.299 --> 08:39.000
Yeah, maybe both of you could wear
one that says "I'm stupid."

08:39.000 --> 08:43.400
You just don't get it, man.
This says that I'm on to them.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.500
This says that I comprehend the
military industrial power dynamic.

08:47.500 --> 08:52.300
That's what this whole thing is about;
wetworks, political assassination.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.200
- That's their theme for this year.
- Where did you hear that?

08:55.200 --> 08:58.100
Oh yeah, like I'm gonna
reveal my sources.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.500
Suffice it to say, there's some big new...

09:00.500 --> 09:08.300
...stealth assassination technology that's supposed
to be unveiled here. And I will be there, front row.

09:08.900 --> 09:12.100
- In the meantime, we're hitting the restaurant.
- Yeah, all you can eat lobster buffet.

09:12.100 --> 09:16.100
Free floor show... plenty of boobage.
You guys down?

09:16.100 --> 09:18.500
You go ahead.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.600
I'll catch up.

09:25.400 --> 09:29.500
- You're one hell of a sad-sack, Byers.
- Lay off about the poker game.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.200
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

09:33.200 --> 09:37.300
You're the one who pushes the hardest
for us to come to these conventions, ...

09:37.300 --> 09:40.600
...then you get all squirrelly
once we get here.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.400
You're still looking for her, aren't you?

09:43.400 --> 09:46.500
- Susanne Modeski.
- We met her at a convention.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.700
Ten years ago.
In Baltimore.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.000
Now we both know what
happened to her.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.700
- Most likely, she's dead.
- No.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.600
She was a brilliant scientist,
too important to the government.

10:01.600 --> 10:08.800
Buddy, either way, I know we're both hoping
she's in a better place than Las Vegas.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.800
Came on. All you
can eat lobster.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.800
I almost won.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.100
Yeah, you and everyone else.

10:20.100 --> 10:24.100
Whoa, Byers, check this out.
I'm feeling lucky.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.700
- It can't be.
- What?

11:07.300 --> 11:10.000
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.200
Byers... what the hell's going on?

11:31.000 --> 11:34.400
- Yeah, Scully.
- Hey, Scully, it's me.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.600
- Mulder, what time is it?
- 2:34am.

11:39.100 --> 11:44.300
- Listen, Scully, I need you on
the next flight to Las Vegas.
- Las Vegas? Why?

11:44.300 --> 11:48.100
It's the Lone Gunmen.
They're onto something big.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.000
What, exactly?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.700
It's really important. Trust me.

11:53.700 --> 11:58.400
Yeah, I trust you, Mulder, it's the
Three Stooges I'm not so sure about.

11:58.400 --> 12:05.600
Look, I can't talk over an unsecured line.
Please just get here. It's an emergency.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.200
Okay.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.500
Okay, okay. Okay.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.800
- What if she calls him back?
- I trapped her cell number. If she calls him, it rings here.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.000
She's gonna kick our ass.
What do you need Scully for, anyway?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.400
We're up against agents of the government.
We need our own government agent.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.300
And that would be Mulder.
Why do you want just Scully?

12:28.300 --> 12:31.400
- She's gonna kick our ass.
- Mulder's too high profile.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.000
He's virtually a household name to the black
ops who kidnapped Susanne in Baltimore.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.400
Byers, I've hacked into the hotel computers,
Susanne Modeski's not registered here.

12:40.400 --> 12:44.600
Are you sure you saw her; are you
absolutely, positively sure?

12:44.600 --> 12:48.300
It was her. She's here.
I've got to find her!

12:48.300 --> 12:52.600
You've gotta find some
ice, you need a drink.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.200
Byers is trying to kill himself.

13:49.200 --> 13:54.100
Stop trying to kill yourself, Byers,
it's not deep enough. Come see what we got.

13:54.600 --> 13:59.600
Room 1066, registered to our mystery
poker player, one Grant Ellis.

13:59.600 --> 14:05.500
- New Mexico plates on his car.
- Which come back listed "DoD motor pool."

14:05.500 --> 14:07.200
Signed out from...

14:07.200 --> 14:11.200
- Whitestone, New Mexico.
- The advanced army weapons facility.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.800
Where Susanne worked.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.500
Ellis's credit cards get billed directly
to the Administrative Offices.

14:16.500 --> 14:20.000
He's looking like he's some kind
of shadow government "poobah."

14:20.000 --> 14:22.700
He brainwashed her.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.000
Well that's what they do there!

14:25.000 --> 14:29.700
The AH gas she developed. Call it psychological
warfare, behavior modification, ...

14:29.700 --> 14:33.100
...but it's all about mind control.

14:33.100 --> 14:37.100
And undoubtedly, the process has
been refined in the last decade.

14:37.100 --> 14:41.100
She ran from them, refused to
take part in their tests, ...

14:41.100 --> 14:44.000
...their crimes against the American people, ...

14:44.000 --> 14:46.800
...there's no way she would choose
to be working for them now, ...

14:46.800 --> 14:51.000
...working for that guy... kissing him.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.300
Clearly he brainwashed her.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.900
I know a way to find out.

15:30.500 --> 15:34.600
I can't get into the conference. The guard
who threw me out is working the door.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.500
Let me go.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.900
CIA, freeze.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.300
That just keeps getting funnier.
Where's your girlfriend, Timmy?

15:45.300 --> 15:49.400
Ah, out in the desert. There's this naked
chick who'll teach you how to shoot machine guns.

15:49.400 --> 15:53.500
It costs 200 beans though,
I told him he was a putz.

15:53.500 --> 15:58.900
What's the matter, Byers?
Your bestest dog die? What's up?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.500
Trying to figure out how to get
into the Saguaro Room.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.600
Good luck. That's the Holy Grail.
Bug sweeps...

16:05.600 --> 16:09.600
Casino security outside, government security inside.
There's no way any of us are getting in.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.200
I can get in there.

16:11.200 --> 16:15.000
And I will, too.
When the time is right.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.100
Oh, go brush your hair, Michael Bolton.

16:18.100 --> 16:21.100
There's a hole in their security,
I've got it all figured out.

16:21.100 --> 16:26.100
But there's nothing worth hearing in
there until tomorrow, when they unveil
their new assassination technology.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.100
Again with the assassination technology.

16:29.100 --> 16:34.300
I need to get in there, Jimmy. I need to know
what's happening in there today.

16:34.300 --> 16:38.400
If you can really get in there, prove it.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.500
...in combat can be established.

16:59.500 --> 17:07.200
Now, if you'll take a look at the kill ratio productivity
chart we've provided for you and turn to...

17:07.200 --> 17:11.500
- ...you'll see that we've experienced a marked...
- Oooh, there's your fascist chickie, Byers.

17:11.500 --> 17:15.400
...first and second quarterly
periods of the previous year.

17:15.400 --> 17:20.900
But, before we're tempted to pat ourselves on the
back for this we have to remember these figures...

17:20.900 --> 17:24.500
- Timmy?
- ...the current operations in Bagdad.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.700
These operations, originally
budgeted for fiscal year '97...

17:27.700 --> 17:29.600
Damn...

17:40.800 --> 17:43.100
Hold on! Hold on!

17:49.700 --> 17:51.800
You're one of them...

17:55.600 --> 17:58.400
You really screwed
things up, Jimmy.

17:59.100 --> 18:03.200
- We had big plans for you.
- Big plans?

18:06.300 --> 18:08.600
Political assassination.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.600
I was right. I was right
about the whole thing!

18:11.600 --> 18:15.400
Every good plan needs a patsy.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.500
- Could you, uh, take this up, please?
- Sure.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.500
- Agent Scully.
- Where's Agent Mulder, I've been trying to call him.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.400
He's, uh, I think that his,
phone's messed up.

18:33.400 --> 18:38.800
He may be hard to reach for the next few hours,
he suggested we work with you, bring you up to speed.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.800
By all means, bring me up to speed.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.900
Subject's name is
James Bellmont, over.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.400
- This way.
- Oh, man. Jimmy.

18:54.300 --> 19:00.000
He just jumped; no warning, no nothing.
He just, dived right out in front of me.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.300
- Oh, God, it is Jimmy.
- It's not my fault.

19:03.300 --> 19:07.200
He was just standing there, and then
he just dives under the bus.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.300
- This wasn't a suicide.
- You know this man?

19:12.600 --> 19:15.600
What's going on here?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.900
Susanne, ...

20:59.900 --> 21:02.500
...do you remember me?

21:03.100 --> 21:05.800
John, what are you doing here?

21:05.800 --> 21:08.200
I'm here to save you.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.200
From what?

21:10.200 --> 21:13.800
I don't think you are yourself.
I think that, uh, ...

21:13.800 --> 21:19.400
...you've been mistreated and confused,
and, and, I'm afraid that your, ...

21:19.400 --> 21:25.400
- ...your beliefs, your opinions, are no longer your own.
- As in, I've been brainwashed?

21:26.100 --> 21:30.500
I don't know what to tell you.
I haven't been.

21:30.500 --> 21:36.000
Your life may be in danger, Susanne.
A friend of mine has just been killed. Murdered.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
What?

21:37.000 --> 21:41.200
- And that man that you're with...
- My fiance?

21:42.200 --> 21:46.300
- I'm sorry John, I, I think you better go.
- No, wait. Wait.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.600
Ten years ago, I saw you
thrown into a car.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.200
Kidnapped right in front of me.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.000
Did that not happen?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.300
Did I just dream all of that?

21:58.200 --> 22:00.900
It happened.

22:01.700 --> 22:04.600
But things got better.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.000
Sorry, buddy.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.600
That Susanne's a popular girl.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.500
You're absolutely sure you
wanna be here for this?

22:50.500 --> 22:53.400
Oh yeah. I'm cool.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.800
Let's just find out what killed him.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.000
Okay.

23:04.500 --> 23:07.700
James Bellmont, age 29.

23:07.700 --> 23:13.800
Visual exam reveals injuries
consistent with massive trauma.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
Multiple rib fractures with concomgent
hemoraging, both internal and external.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.400
His spine is fractured
and partially exposed.

23:26.800 --> 23:32.500
What if "they" did something to him?
You know, to make him pancake himself?

23:32.500 --> 23:34.900
Who's "they"?

23:34.900 --> 23:37.600
You know, "them."

23:37.800 --> 23:41.100
I'll begin with the Y-incision.

24:11.800 --> 24:18.000
Langly, will you go over there and pass me the
striker saw please, it's right there on the counter.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.800
Are you okay, Langly?

25:07.100 --> 25:09.200
Scully?

25:20.300 --> 25:23.100
Scully. Wake up.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.800
Are you okay?

25:24.800 --> 25:26.400
What happened?

25:27.100 --> 25:29.800
I'm thinking that you got a
little queasy and took a header.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.500
You know blood and guts can
bother some people.

25:32.500 --> 25:36.200
Yeah, I guess.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.800
You gonna be alright?

25:39.900 --> 25:42.700
Sure, cutie.

25:46.900 --> 25:50.100
So... you're done with Jimmy?

25:50.500 --> 25:53.200
Done, done, done.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.800
How do you roll this thing?

25:59.800 --> 26:01.800
Scully?

26:02.600 --> 26:05.600
What killed him?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
My medical opinion?

26:16.700 --> 26:21.200
- And that's all you found?
- That's all I know.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.500
Scully?

26:31.000 --> 26:35.600
- What'd you find out?
- Autopsy was negatory. Jimmy squished himself.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.600
And where is the
scruptious Agent Scully?

26:38.600 --> 26:41.000
She said she had something
important to do.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.700
Man, she is seriously jetlagged.
You got product already?

26:45.700 --> 26:48.800
No, an earlier bird got the worm.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.700
...it's like they're keeping
tabs on us, watching us.

26:53.700 --> 27:01.000
Honey, you worry too much. The plan is still
on schedule. Everything's falling into place.

27:03.800 --> 27:07.300
We've worked so long and
so hard for this.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.100
It's not her.

27:11.100 --> 27:14.300
They're making her
do this somehow.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.500
Buddy, now, I know something
about the fairer sex.

27:18.500 --> 27:23.200
Trust me, you can bring a horse to water,
but you can't make her drink.

27:23.200 --> 27:28.000
- She would not marry that man.
- You don't know him like I do.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.500
How'd you get in here?

27:30.600 --> 27:33.600
One of you left this in my room.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.600
Grant Ellis saved my life.
He's saved the lives of thousands.

27:40.700 --> 27:45.200
I need to talk to you, John,
I need to try and explain everything.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.700
C'mon, let's hit the slots.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.800
Watch your back.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.000
Mata Hari.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.300
You said something about a
friend being murdered.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.500
Not that I can prove it.

28:04.500 --> 28:09.700
But I think he saw something he was
not supposed to see at your conference.

28:09.700 --> 28:14.200
- You may be in danger.
- I am. Always.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.200
So is Grant.

28:21.300 --> 28:25.900
I've thought about this
moment so many times.

28:25.900 --> 28:30.300
All the things I would say to you
if I ever saw you again.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.300
And then there you were,
at my door, and I...

28:42.200 --> 28:46.100
They took me ten years ago.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.500
They did things to me.

28:49.500 --> 28:56.200
And it was like drowning every day;
under water, struggling to breathe, ...

28:56.200 --> 29:02.600
...and one day, a hand broke the surface,
reached down and pulled me up.

29:02.600 --> 29:09.100
I wanted it to be you, John.
It was Grant.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.600
He worked for them on The Project.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.500
I didn't trust him, not for years.

29:15.500 --> 29:19.700
Not until I realized that he was
working against them in his own way; ...

29:19.700 --> 29:24.200
...stalling them, sabotaging their tests.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.600
He reminded me of you.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.800
- They're just lucky I got a conscience.
- How's that?

29:32.800 --> 29:36.500
If I unleashed my true kung-fu on this casino,
I could break the bank within a week.

29:36.500 --> 29:40.200
And find yourself buried
under six feet of desert dirt.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.700
- Hey guys.
- Hey Timmy. I'm sorry about Jimmy.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
Hey, Langly, the guys are all up in my room for a
round of Dungeons and Dragons in honor of Jimmy.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.500
Lord Manhammer will be
in attendance.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.900
I'm gonna go play a little
D&D, uh, in memorium.

29:59.900 --> 30:02.000
That's touching, man.

30:31.100 --> 30:36.900
- Scully?
- Aw, hey. Long time, no see.

30:39.300 --> 30:44.000
No, that's not nice.
I like Hickey.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.400
Cigarette?

30:57.600 --> 31:00.500
You don't smoke.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
But who's got a match?

31:05.700 --> 31:08.000
Well...

31:08.200 --> 31:13.400
I just can't decide
who lights my fire.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.000
That's it.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.100
Alright, you dandies, back off.

31:18.100 --> 31:21.700
This is Special Agent Dana Scully
of the FBI. If you so much as touch her, ...

31:21.700 --> 31:23.800
...you may be committing
a federal offense.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.200
Come on, come on.

31:26.700 --> 31:29.200
We could have been stardust.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.600
Maybe next time.

31:38.200 --> 31:42.300
Hope you brought your wallet, my friend,
just because this is a memorial... game.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.500
What's this?

31:43.500 --> 31:46.500
Oh, we have got a game for you.

31:48.700 --> 31:52.200
Trust me, this is gonna work.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.200
- You didn't tape this?
- No.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.200
Which means they surveilled us.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.500
They know our plans,
they know everything.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.000
What is your plan?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.800
To escape.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.200
This conference was our chance
to slip out on the last day.

32:08.200 --> 32:13.000
Go public with our files,
all our weapons research.

32:13.600 --> 32:19.500
We could finally make it happen this time.
We'd gathered up enough proof.

32:19.500 --> 32:23.500
The public is ready to believe
now more than ever.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.800
They know everything.

32:28.100 --> 32:32.100
They'll kill us, John;
Grant and me both.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.300
- Come on.
- Hi.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.700
- Came on, settle down, settle down.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.800
I found Agent Scully-go-lightly
holding court... bar!

32:42.800 --> 32:45.900
I've never seen her drunk before...

32:46.500 --> 32:49.200
God, this can't be.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.300
She's not drunk, look at this.

32:58.300 --> 33:03.500
- That was made by an injector gun.
- Well, what the hell was she injected with?!

33:04.200 --> 33:10.200
It's derivative of AH gas. AH, anoitic
histamine, my latest creation.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.600
I could have developed it
years ago, but I held off.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.700
I wasn't about to let those bastards
I work for get their hands on it.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.400
Grant thought that if we secretly
developed a small batch, ...

33:20.400 --> 33:24.900
...and then destroyed the notes, that we would
have the proof we needed to go public.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.300
We'd also have a weapon we
could use against them.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.100
Who else has access to
this anoitic histamine?

33:30.100 --> 33:33.800
Grant and I are the only
two people that ha...

33:37.200 --> 33:39.800
...that have the samples.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.300
- This will counteract the anoitic effect.
- Hi, cutie.

33:52.200 --> 33:55.000
Just a little prick...

33:59.200 --> 34:00.600
Bad trip?

34:00.600 --> 34:04.600
Nah, she'll be fine.
She just needs to sleep it off.

34:04.600 --> 34:08.300
I don't understand; why would the government
want to turn Scully into a bimbo?

34:08.300 --> 34:13.800
That's just a potential side-effect.
Anoitic histamine impedes higher brain functions.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.699
- It promotes suggestability.
- Mind control. Brainwashing.

34:17.699 --> 34:21.600
That explains Jimmy.
They told him to commit suicide.

34:21.600 --> 34:26.199
And Scully. They made her
forget her autopsy findings.

34:26.199 --> 34:31.600
But what is their larger purpose?
What are they planning?

34:32.800 --> 34:36.900
Well, whatever it is,
we better find out fast.

34:46.900 --> 34:48.900
Right on time.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.400
This is your weapon.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.100
All you do is pull the trigger.

35:00.500 --> 35:07.400
You will enter the Saguaro Room at 10:05am.
This badge will give you access.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.700
Take a seat toward
the back, and wait.

35:10.700 --> 35:17.300
At 10:15, a break will be called. Rise,
approach the target, and fire three shots.

35:17.400 --> 35:21.400
This brings us to the notion
of acceptable risk. Of course, ...

35:21.400 --> 35:28.800
...risk is defined as exposure, during both
utilization and post-project evaluation.

35:28.800 --> 35:38.000
Now in a secure proving-ground, i.e. a domestic
engagement, we have had great success.

35:38.000 --> 35:45.800
Now off-shore utilizations can afford a more
comprehensive definition of acceptable risk.

35:45.800 --> 35:50.200
Proper target appraisal can provide
a risk-free trial environment.

35:50.200 --> 35:54.900
A combination of political instability and lack
of efficient infrastructure can offer a, uh, ...

35:54.900 --> 36:00.200
...target area of nearly
zero risk potential.

36:01.800 --> 36:05.700
- Authorized attendees only.
- I'm an FBI agent.

36:05.700 --> 36:08.600
Authorized attendees.

36:09.500 --> 36:15.000
Of course, risk management goes hand-in-hand
with operational preparedness, ...

36:15.000 --> 36:18.300
...and that happens to be our topic
for the remainder of the session...

36:18.300 --> 36:21.400
Al, I think this would be a good
time to take a break, shall we?

36:21.400 --> 36:23.300
Oh, yeah.

36:23.300 --> 36:27.000
Let's take five everybody.
Smoke 'em if ya got 'em.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.100
Oh my God.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.400
Somebody help her... somebody!

37:24.400 --> 37:27.900
- Susanne...
- Federal agent.

37:29.700 --> 37:30.900
Call for help.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.800
Winston Warbler, we need an ambulance,
a woman's been shot.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.800
- She's bleeding, hurry.
- We're on our way.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.300
Who did this?
Who did this!?

37:41.300 --> 37:43.600
Shooter got away.

37:43.600 --> 37:47.700
Detain this man,
get him outta here.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.200
Good work, party girl.

38:29.900 --> 38:32.100
I'll take him from here.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.400
Wait a minute, where... where...
where're you taking me?

38:58.300 --> 39:00.600
Susanne?

39:04.100 --> 39:07.300
Can we have a moment, alone, please?

39:08.200 --> 39:10.300
I'll be fine.

39:10.300 --> 39:13.400
- We'll be right down the hall.
- Okay.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.700
Thanks for the tip.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.400
Big surprise, huh?

39:24.400 --> 39:27.100
Since you programmed
my friend to kill me.

39:27.100 --> 39:31.100
- No, Susanne, it wasn't my idea.
- You knew about it.

39:31.100 --> 39:35.500
You gave it to them.
The AH.

39:35.500 --> 39:40.500
If I hadn't thought to check Langly,
if I hadn't given him the antidote...

39:46.100 --> 39:48.900
I don't understand.

39:50.900 --> 39:55.000
Why save me? Why save my
life just to take it away?

39:55.000 --> 39:59.400
- You know why.
- You were done with me.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.300
- You had what you wanted.
- "They" had what they wanted.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.600
The project was over.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.300
Honest to God, it wasn't my idea.

40:09.300 --> 40:13.700
All those years you spent
gaining my trust.

40:13.700 --> 40:16.200
You pretended that you loved me.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.400
What could they possibly
give you for that?

40:19.400 --> 40:23.900
What was it worth to you, Grant?
What was your price?

40:23.900 --> 40:27.000
What did you get!

40:27.000 --> 40:29.400
Life.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.100
They'd kill me.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.500
Hello.

40:39.300 --> 40:42.300
I'm so sorry, Susanne.

40:48.400 --> 40:51.400
County death records first,
then the state tax rolls, come on!

40:51.400 --> 40:54.100
Then the Clark County Morgue
list that they misplaced the body.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.800
Yeah, Voltaire comidant.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.900
Why don't you just zap me with the girly
sting there and brainwash me again.

40:58.900 --> 41:02.200
I say do it, then we can make
him cut his hair.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.000
Can you answer that?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.900
Why me, she's your little chickadee.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.400
Hurry up, come on.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.200
Come on in, Mata Hari.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.200
CIA, freeze.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.600
Let her go.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.000
Sure...

41:27.200 --> 41:30.300
You know the best thing
about killing you three...

41:30.300 --> 41:34.300
I won't have to dress
like you anymore...

41:38.700 --> 41:41.400
