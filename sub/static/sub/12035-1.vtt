Boston, Massachusetts, 1972

01:15.033 --> 01:18.036
Our Father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.914
Thy kingdom come.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.669

02:12.591 --> 02:15.802
Drop the knife!

02:55.634 --> 02:58.720
- Hello.
- Hey there!

02:58.804 --> 03:01.139
- Oh god.
- How are you?

03:01.223 --> 03:04.852
- Well, and what about you?
- Super. You look amazing.

03:04.935 --> 03:08.272
- How is the grandmother?
- All right, all things considered.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.650
She has received its first
chemo, but seemed in good spirits.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.987
- It's probably good? It looks bright.
- Yes.

03:15.070 --> 03:18.907
Let me take your suitcase.
You do not have much luggage.

03:18.991 --> 03:23.036
We have so much to talk about.
Your carriage awaits!

03:27.291 --> 03:31.628
- Tell you how it is.
- What?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.756
- The new place.
- Of course, yes.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.886
It is much larger
and better than the old place.

03:38.969 --> 03:43.640
We've got moved all things,
but they are still packed.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.852
We will not come into place,
before school begins.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.105
But now when you are here,
yesterday it might anyway.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.443
- Okay, so there we are.
- It is so exciting.

04:05.662 --> 04:10.626
- I like it.
- Can you? Yes. Yes.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.088
What is it?

04:15.172 --> 04:18.175
Damn. They are here.

04:20.344 --> 04:24.515
- Okay, here it is.
- It is so fine.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.142
- Exit through the window.
- What?

04:27.226 --> 04:30.229
You heard what I said.

04:32.773 --> 04:37.402
- It is so much better.
- Yes, and you know what the best is?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.863
- We pay the same rent.
- That's a lie.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.450
- Have I done well?
- You have done well.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.913
- Hey, Alex.
- Bree.

04:47.996 --> 04:52.334
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

04:53.335 --> 04:58.006
- How is the grandmother?
- Good. She's better.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.759
- Hello.
- Hey, Jess.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.095
It was a long time ago.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.934
- Welcome back, sweetie.
- Brian!

05:13.105 --> 05:17.067
- How sweet.
- That's it.

05:17.150 --> 05:22.990
- I'll show you the rest of the house. Come on.
- Carry cases up to be a good boyfriend.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.827
- You bully already with me.
- What is this?

05:30.581 --> 05:33.458
- Nothing.
- Okay.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.134
And last, but not least:
This is your bedroom.

05:42.217 --> 05:45.137
What do you think?

05:45.220 --> 05:49.850
I thought you'd like it
like this, but you can move the furniture.

05:49.933 --> 05:54.271
- Or you can hop in bed.
- I love it.

05:54.354 --> 05:59.276
I could have chosen the room, but I
is the buffer between you and miss cumbersome.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.947
It's like I do not like her.
I can. She does not like me.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.159
How is she just.
Do not worry about it.

06:07.242 --> 06:12.122
She wanted this room, but
she thought it was too scary.

06:12.206 --> 06:17.711
She did not even know what a ceiling
was. "I will not sleep in the attic."

06:17.794 --> 06:22.424
- Not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
- With large breasts means nothing.

06:22.508 --> 06:26.512
Did you take your grandmother with?
It weighs a ton.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.725
Sorry, I did not ...

06:32.559 --> 06:35.354
This is really embarrassing.

06:35.437 --> 06:40.025
I leave you in peace.
I have much to be obtained.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.528
- Jess?
- Yes?

06:42.611 --> 06:47.658
- Thanks for everything. I appreciate it.
- It's okay.

06:47.741 --> 06:53.539
I almost forgot one thing. We are a
bunch to be out and partying tomorrow.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.959
- Are you in?
- Yes.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.589
Listen ... Sorry. I ...

07:02.673 --> 07:05.968
I do not know what I was thinking
when I said it.

07:07.052 --> 07:10.097
- It's okay.
- How is she?

07:10.180 --> 07:15.519
She's pretty cool.
I think she'll make it.

07:23.861 --> 07:27.823
Listen ... Thanks for everything.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.910
I know it's been hard.

07:31.994 --> 07:38.500
I never thought that I would be away
throughout the summer. I'll make it again.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.254
Okay.

07:51.638 --> 07:56.185
- I love you.
- I love you too.

08:35.474 --> 08:39.852
- Come on, slut. We shall dance.
- No, I have a girlfriend.

08:39.937 --> 08:45.192
Are you kidding? It does not matter? If
you drink like me, you remember nothing.

08:45.275 --> 08:50.405
- You need to get laid.
- Do not be so squeamish.

08:50.489 --> 08:54.451
- You must have some vodka.
- Saved by the bell.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.371
Then there are more men for me.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.957
Hi there.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.835
Something has come up.

09:02.918 --> 09:07.464
My father needed my help tomorrow
early, so I have to go home and sleep.

09:07.548 --> 09:11.802
- No, do not go.
- Sorry. He's my father.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.721
- Will not you be?
- I have to go.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.684
Keep the skin.

09:34.408 --> 09:38.078
- Where is Brian?
- He had to help his father.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.665
Perfect.
Now you have no excuses.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.460
- This place sucks.
- No, well do not.

09:45.544 --> 09:49.673
There are men, booze and music.
What more do you need?

09:49.756 --> 09:54.219
- I'm leaving.
- Okay. See you at home.

09:54.303 --> 10:01.018
- Where is she going?
- Who knows? Dance with me.

10:01.101 --> 10:05.522
- He was so pounding delicious.
- He was probably right.

10:05.606 --> 10:09.234
Okay?
He may well take my dress off me.

10:09.318 --> 10:14.781
Okay, okay. You're not my friend
if you do not think he's hot.

10:14.865 --> 10:21.705
- Slow down drunk.
- Oh god. How it should be.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.666
- No, we're going home.
- It is fate.

10:24.750 --> 10:29.838
No, no, no.
"Do not you predicted, little girl?"

10:29.922 --> 10:32.674
- No.
- It'll be fun. Come on.

10:32.758 --> 10:38.931
- It'll be fun.
- What do I not your fault.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.276
- Hello!
- Jess.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.239
Are there any?

10:55.322 --> 10:59.159
Good grief. Look at this.
What the hell is that?

10:59.243 --> 11:03.747
- I mean it, Jess.
- It's a monkey with a hat.

11:03.831 --> 11:07.125
Hello. We call him William.

11:07.209 --> 11:11.421
We go home, Jess. Concentrate.

11:11.505 --> 11:18.512
- You look beautiful tonight.
- Thank you. Be quiet. We go now.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.266
- Good grief. What the hell is this?
- Jess.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.935
- No, look.
- Jessica.

11:25.018 --> 11:31.441
- Oh god, it's true.
- Can we go now?

11:31.525 --> 11:37.406
It may not be a real baby.
It looks like a murder. We should call ...

11:37.489 --> 11:39.867
Can I help you?

11:42.911 --> 11:45.164
Yes.

11:45.247 --> 11:48.917
- Yes.
- Should not you know what we want?

11:49.001 --> 11:52.963
You're psychic.
We would like predicted.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.550
- We would like predicted.
- She's a little ...

11:56.633 --> 12:01.513
You are so cute in your sigøjnertøj.

12:01.597 --> 12:06.894
You're a gypsy hippie.
You are a shippie!

12:06.977 --> 12:09.688
I'm really sorry.

12:09.771 --> 12:13.150
Come on. Calm, quiet.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.153
Do you have cash?

12:16.236 --> 12:19.364
Here you go. It is for her.
I pay for her -

12:19.448 --> 12:23.660
- As if I were her
man or bitch.

12:23.744 --> 12:28.415
- Come on, ladies.
- I'm hungry. I take a bean.

12:28.499 --> 12:31.335
Can not ...

12:31.418 --> 12:33.504
Wait for me.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.131
Hallo.

12:44.556 --> 12:49.394
- Where's Whoopi?
- Sit down.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.485
Give me your hand.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.863
No. Give me your hand.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.920
- Aries.
- How the hell did you know?

13:15.003 --> 13:17.923
How could she know?

13:29.768 --> 13:33.021
You are worried.

13:33.105 --> 13:36.733
You are worried about a ...

13:38.360 --> 13:41.905
What kind of cancer is it?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.244
Breast cancer.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.628
I see something. Wait.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.643
There is no here.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.402
What? Where?

14:31.205 --> 14:34.708
What the hell was that?

14:35.501 --> 14:38.837
Who is Maggie?

14:40.589 --> 14:43.342
It's my mother.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.387
I am sorry that she has passed away.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.310
Do you think that you can see her?

14:55.479 --> 14:59.233
She's worried about you.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.611
She is scared on your behalf.

15:05.155 --> 15:08.033
What are you talking about?

15:09.785 --> 15:12.412
Wait.

15:12.496 --> 15:16.208
There is someone with her.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.628
I can not see them clearly.

15:19.711 --> 15:23.674
They hide for me.

15:28.178 --> 15:32.599
- Who are you?
- I will not continue.

15:32.683 --> 15:36.061
- Show yourself to me.
- Stop it!

15:36.144 --> 15:40.983
- I do not want more.
- I command you to show you!

15:45.863 --> 15:48.115
Oh god.

17:04.733 --> 17:08.444
- Hey, dormouse.
- Why did you wake me?

17:08.529 --> 17:12.366
I tried.
You were almost in a coma.

17:12.449 --> 17:17.162
- Do you have any aspirin?
- They stand on the table.

17:17.246 --> 17:20.374
No, look in the cupboard over you.

17:22.125 --> 17:26.003
My head feels like
that it has been driven over.

17:26.088 --> 17:30.551
You made me wild afraid yesterday
with your little scene.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.098
Scene? What do you think?

17:36.181 --> 17:39.852
What do you mean by that?

17:39.935 --> 17:44.231
Are you kidding me?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.902
Can not remember the fortune teller?

17:50.237 --> 17:56.451
On the way home we visited a fortune teller.
At the snack bar that you like.

17:57.995 --> 18:03.792
- Do not you remember that we were there?
- No. Why would we do that?

18:03.876 --> 18:07.629
Because we had drunk too much.

18:07.713 --> 18:10.799
I thought you were dying.

18:13.760 --> 18:18.724
Why can not I remember?
I can only remember that we went home.

18:18.807 --> 18:22.728
I do not know
why you do not remember it.

18:24.146 --> 18:29.443
- It's probably just as well.
- What do you mean?

18:29.526 --> 18:33.280
I do not know.
It was really strange.

18:33.363 --> 18:37.534
- How?
- We were there both and you began.

18:37.618 --> 18:44.708
I can not remember. She said,
that there was someone who wanted to talk to you.

18:44.791 --> 18:49.087
So freaking her out,
and then freak you out.

18:49.171 --> 18:53.008
We were so full yesterday.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.345
She got it,
she was looking for - our money.

18:56.428 --> 19:01.225
Why can not I remember?
Was there anyone who gave me a drink?

19:01.308 --> 19:06.271
- Not that I know of.
- Maybe someone drugged me.

19:06.355 --> 19:13.362
Do not worry about it. You feel good,
I feel good and she has $ 60.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.448
We just got too much to drink.

19:16.532 --> 19:20.536
Now when we talk about it,
I will drink too much tonight.

19:20.619 --> 19:24.289
Are you with if I plan something?

19:24.373 --> 19:26.708
Alex?

19:26.792 --> 19:30.963
- Are you in?
- Slapper I never of

19:31.046 --> 19:35.259
No, not on our last day of freedom.
You have to do something.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.345
I'm planning something
and then you can give the message later.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.515
The way I have it,
I think I players fold.

19:41.598 --> 19:45.060
Is it hard to think?

19:45.143 --> 19:49.773
I must have washed. I have not
more panties. Should I wash for you?

19:49.857 --> 19:53.360
- No, you do not need.
- Okay.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.582
Bree?

22:26.096 --> 22:28.265
Hello?

22:34.813 --> 22:36.940
Jess?

26:25.419 --> 26:29.965
Crusoe has been on the island
in less than a week.

26:31.550 --> 26:35.137
There are running out of food,
and it looks bad with drinking water -

26:35.220 --> 26:41.018
- But the worst thing is the loneliness,
beginning to grow inside him.

26:41.101 --> 26:46.315
The isolation he feels
begins to be expressed.

26:46.398 --> 26:52.070
This happens before he meets Friday.

26:52.154 --> 26:54.948
In history's context -

26:55.032 --> 27:00.037
- What is it in
the protagonist's consciousness -

27:00.120 --> 27:04.666
- Which manifests itself in his everyday life.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.170
He is all alone -

27:08.253 --> 27:14.927
- And he does not know how long his
tropical vacation is going to last.

27:15.010 --> 27:22.100
Come on!
This is classic literature.

27:22.184 --> 27:27.397
Come on. I know that it
is the first day. Someone?

27:37.157 --> 27:39.576
Are you okay?

27:39.660 --> 27:43.121
- Hello?
- Yes.

27:44.456 --> 27:47.292
I'm fine.

27:51.547 --> 27:55.342
I should be able to it here
at the end of the semester.

27:57.094 --> 28:03.892
So I want
that all concentrate on the material.

28:36.258 --> 28:38.427
- Hey, biatch.
- Hello.

28:38.510 --> 28:42.264
How are you?

28:42.347 --> 28:47.186
- I'm completely finished.
- Why?

28:47.269 --> 28:53.358
It was me who was in town yesterday,
which I regretted this morning.

28:55.944 --> 28:58.322
Jess.

29:04.828 --> 29:07.873
Have you experienced any
weird around the house?

29:07.956 --> 29:14.254
- Yes, we pay the same rent as before.
- It was not what I meant.

29:15.506 --> 29:20.093
Have you heard strange noises?

29:20.177 --> 29:23.722
No, the only strange noises,
is when Bree has a boyfriend to visit.

29:23.805 --> 29:28.101
- I mean it.
- Sorry.

29:28.185 --> 29:33.357
- No, I think not. Why?
- It's like ...

29:33.440 --> 29:38.028
Occasionally I hear scratching noises
Interior walls.

29:38.111 --> 29:42.574
- What kind of scratching sound?
- Just scratching sounds.

29:42.658 --> 29:46.036
- Okay.
- Yes.

29:46.119 --> 29:49.832
And what more?

29:50.999 --> 29:54.253
You know well that feeling of,
that one is in a room -

29:54.336 --> 29:57.923
- And it feels like,
anyone looking at one.

29:58.841 --> 30:04.388
- It felt like that.
- Was it yesterday?

30:04.471 --> 30:08.934
- Yes.
- You were alone in a new house.

30:09.017 --> 30:12.813
- We have probably mice
- Mouse?

30:12.896 --> 30:18.277
Yes. Scratching noises. It is an old house.
There is probably a mouse or two.

30:18.360 --> 30:24.616
- Should it make me feel better?
- I buy a few traps and fix it.

30:25.951 --> 30:30.372
- Maybe it's a big fat rat.
- It's not funny.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.877
You are not kidding.

31:01.820 --> 31:04.072
Jess?

31:16.502 --> 31:18.712
Jess?

31:20.255 --> 31:22.758
Is this you?

32:04.091 --> 32:06.844
It is not sateme Mice.

32:49.887 --> 32:53.223
What are you doing?

32:53.307 --> 32:55.684
Nothing.

32:56.268 --> 33:01.732
- Did you hear something scratching just before?
- Scratching? No.

33:03.317 --> 33:06.153
Forget it.

33:06.236 --> 33:09.406
Have a good night, Alex.

34:23.647 --> 34:25.858
Hello.

34:32.697 --> 34:35.701
Do you live here in the neighborhood?

34:40.873 --> 34:43.583
Are you too shy to say anything?

34:50.424 --> 34:53.342
He is out to get you.

34:55.846 --> 34:58.640
Do you want a ride?

35:08.483 --> 35:11.153
Are you okay?

35:12.613 --> 35:15.908
I'm sorry,
but I saw that is no small girl.

35:15.991 --> 35:19.661
- I mean it.
- Okay. Relax.

35:19.745 --> 35:25.042
It's a little hard to believe,
what you say.

35:29.630 --> 35:32.883
Let's look at the drawings.

35:45.604 --> 35:50.901
I believed that I did everything
to get rid of homework.

35:57.324 --> 36:02.579
It's just something squiggle.
Someone shitting you.

36:02.663 --> 36:08.043
It's not the only one.
I see and hear things that are not there.

36:08.126 --> 36:12.631
You are under a lot of pressure at the moment.
There is everything there with your grandmother.

36:12.714 --> 36:17.344
- The school starts and you live somewhere new.
- Maybe there is something wrong with me.

36:17.427 --> 36:20.681
There's nothing wrong with you.

36:23.475 --> 36:28.647
I can look past tomorrow. I
can stay over and we can enjoy a little.

36:28.730 --> 36:33.610
- We can watch a movie?
- Why not tonight?

36:33.694 --> 36:36.530
I can not tonight.

36:36.613 --> 36:41.994
I need to move a
lot of things for my father.

36:42.077 --> 36:45.038
What do you say? Tomorrow night?

36:52.921 --> 36:56.925
- Why do it?
- When you talk about the sun ...

36:59.094 --> 37:02.055
My dad can not wait for
I come home.

37:02.139 --> 37:05.392
Come, let us go home to you.

38:24.096 --> 38:26.265
Alex?

38:37.442 --> 38:40.612
Hell, Alex.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.741
Alex?

39:09.516 --> 39:13.103
- Jess. Jess!
- What?

39:13.187 --> 39:16.607
Wake up and remove your strange friend
from my room.

39:16.690 --> 39:22.196
- What are you talking about?
- Come on. She scares me.

39:22.279 --> 39:24.823
Okay.

39:24.907 --> 39:26.200
- Come on.
- Yes.

39:31.705 --> 39:37.127
I would swear that she was just here
before and she was really creepy.

39:37.211 --> 39:43.675
Take it easy. Can not help but
to be such a drama queen?

39:45.719 --> 39:48.514
Bitch.

39:49.139 --> 39:52.559
Alex? Are you here?

39:53.769 --> 39:55.854
Hello.

39:56.772 --> 39:59.024
What are you doing?

40:02.110 --> 40:04.321
Alex?

40:15.249 --> 40:17.668
Are you okay?

40:29.930 --> 40:32.516
Do not touch her!

41:27.070 --> 41:32.618
- How did he look? Was he cute?
- Of course. Otherwise it is a no-go.

41:32.701 --> 41:36.622
- Good morning.
- Good morning, freak.

41:46.507 --> 41:49.218
What's wrong with her?

41:59.019 --> 42:04.858
- Can you really do not remember anything?
- What?

42:04.942 --> 42:09.780
- You must have been sleepwalking.
- What are you talking about?

42:09.863 --> 42:15.828
Bree said you stood
stared at her two o'clock in the night.

42:15.911 --> 42:17.788
- What?
- Yes.

42:17.871 --> 42:22.835
I went into your room
and then you stand and stare out the window.

42:23.919 --> 42:28.715
When I tried to help you
you went crazy.

42:29.758 --> 42:33.178
What is going on?

42:36.515 --> 42:39.184
I do not know.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.448
Demons

43:28.859 --> 43:31.904
Obsessed with demons

43:35.324 --> 43:37.576
Warning Signs of obsession

43:37.659 --> 43:40.996
Personality Change

43:41.079 --> 43:47.377
Changed sleeping habits
Hear Voices

43:47.461 --> 43:51.089
Bruises and scratches
The person may appear catatonic

43:51.173 --> 43:56.428
Amnesia
Sexual assault

43:58.639 --> 44:01.225
Exorcism

44:09.149 --> 44:10.609
Next

44:22.454 --> 44:27.835
Her condition was due
that she had been possessed by demons.

44:27.918 --> 44:32.589
More demons. Exorcism.
Her death.

45:25.225 --> 45:28.103
What is going on?

45:44.578 --> 45:48.207
Alexandra! Alexandra.

45:48.290 --> 45:51.543
Hello. How are you?

45:51.627 --> 45:56.131
Are you okay?
Do you have time for a chat?

46:01.845 --> 46:06.308
I do not usually do
something here -

46:06.391 --> 46:12.272
- But Jessica is one of my best
students, so I could not say no.

46:12.356 --> 46:15.359
Let me get straight to the point.

46:15.442 --> 46:19.655
Jess told me about the situation.
She's worried about you.

46:19.738 --> 46:22.491
- Okay.
- Do not worry.

46:22.574 --> 46:28.330
I promised to talk to you, but if
you will not, I will not push you.

46:28.413 --> 46:32.668
I hardly dare ask
but what has she told?

46:32.751 --> 46:37.965
She's worried about you.
More should have the kind of friends.

46:42.636 --> 46:46.390
- Want to talk about it?
- Should I say how I feel?

46:46.473 --> 46:50.519
- As if I'm going insane.
- Wait a minute. Jess just said ...

46:50.602 --> 46:55.315
... That you are under a lot of pressure with
thought of everything that happens in your life.

46:55.399 --> 47:00.237
When you think about what she has
told, it is fully understandable.

47:06.118 --> 47:11.623
You know what? I will not
push you to talk to me.

47:11.707 --> 47:14.877
I can recommend some help -

47:14.960 --> 47:21.341
- But if you want to confide in me,
I'm here in the afternoon.

47:21.425 --> 47:24.761
You are always welcome.

47:24.845 --> 47:27.890
Does that sound right?

47:30.893 --> 47:32.769
Yes.

47:32.853 --> 47:36.482
Sometimes you just
need someone who listens.

47:38.650 --> 47:40.777
Thank you.

48:06.470 --> 48:09.431
- Hey, baby.
- Hello.

48:09.515 --> 48:13.936
- You need to come over here right now.
- What is it? Where?

48:14.019 --> 48:19.691
- Come home to me as soon as you can.
- Okay, okay.

48:19.775 --> 48:22.986
- I'll be there in an hour.
- I'm on my way there now.

48:24.530 --> 48:27.699
What would the mad virgin?

48:27.783 --> 48:33.997
How can you stand it? I've been
together for two years and you will have no sex.

48:34.081 --> 48:37.793
- Will you shut up?
- You know I'm right.

48:37.876 --> 48:42.214
- That's it.
- If she is so perfect ...

48:42.297 --> 48:46.426
... Then you would probably not fuck me.
- Bree.

48:46.510 --> 48:48.971
I progressed.

49:10.617 --> 49:16.456
When I sleep, I can feel it -

49:16.540 --> 49:21.670
- That it touches me and breathe on me.

49:30.262 --> 49:33.765
You might have one of those dreams,
where you think you are awake.

49:33.849 --> 49:37.811
Do you? Did the dream this?

49:37.895 --> 49:41.023
What happened? Come here.

49:41.106 --> 49:46.653
- If it happened while you were sleeping?
- Yes, while I slept.

49:46.737 --> 49:51.617
- It is also on my thighs.
- You should take a look at it.

49:51.700 --> 49:54.953
- Or go to the doctor.
- Why?

49:55.037 --> 49:58.332
So your doctor may consider me
as my boyfriend does.

49:58.415 --> 50:00.542
Sorry.

50:00.626 --> 50:06.590
I'm sorry, but it is difficult
to believe in what you say.

50:07.508 --> 50:10.177
Sit down.

50:17.267 --> 50:20.979
It feels like
I'm going insane.

50:24.608 --> 50:28.153
You are not going crazy.

50:31.657 --> 50:34.159
Okay?

51:08.110 --> 51:10.988
- Why did you do it?
- What?

51:11.488 --> 51:14.408
The bed.

51:18.120 --> 51:23.292
Is that how you say no?
Finder on case histories?

51:23.375 --> 51:26.962
- Hurting yourself?
- What?

51:28.172 --> 51:30.966
I mean ...

51:31.049 --> 51:34.428
Should we never have sex?

51:34.511 --> 51:38.390
Two years is not long enough?

51:38.473 --> 51:44.688
Hell, Alex!
I've been more than patient!

51:44.771 --> 51:49.067
How long, Alex? How long?

51:49.151 --> 51:51.236
A year?

51:51.320 --> 51:53.864
Two years?

51:53.947 --> 51:58.911
This is not fair.
You're acting like an asshole.

51:58.994 --> 52:04.333
No. What you're doing to me is not fair.

52:05.751 --> 52:11.882
You know what? To the poor,
Once you know what the hell you want.

52:16.261 --> 52:18.889
Brian?

52:54.424 --> 52:57.219
Stop it!

53:26.582 --> 53:29.626
Oh god ...

53:29.710 --> 53:33.422
Are you all right, Alex?
What happened?

53:33.505 --> 53:35.799
What is it?

53:35.883 --> 53:39.136
Say something, Alex.

53:39.219 --> 53:42.806
What is it? Come on, Alex.

53:42.890 --> 53:45.142
Come on.

53:46.059 --> 53:50.230
- Make it stop.
- What?

53:50.314 --> 53:53.734
You'll have to say it,
otherwise I can not help you.

53:53.817 --> 53:57.112
- What should quit?
- Will not you.

53:57.196 --> 54:01.867
- Make it stop.
- After all, you're cold.

54:01.950 --> 54:06.455
It's okay.

54:07.915 --> 54:11.502
You'll have to talk to me.

54:17.257 --> 54:21.345
I'll put you right in the bath. Okay?

54:21.428 --> 54:23.722
What the hell?

54:23.805 --> 54:26.558
Who the hell did this?

54:26.642 --> 54:28.560
Good grief.

54:28.644 --> 54:30.771
Alex?

54:30.854 --> 54:36.151
- We are now taking to the hospital.
- No. No!

54:36.235 --> 54:38.654
- Not the hospital!
- Okay, okay.

54:38.737 --> 54:45.160
Okay, relax now.
I'm not taking you to the hospital.

54:45.244 --> 54:50.707
Okay, we're not in the hospital.

54:52.709 --> 54:56.171
You'll ...
Alex, you're gonna be okay.

54:56.255 --> 55:02.261
I will not hurt you.
We just have to get washed up.

55:02.344 --> 55:05.556
Come on, Alex.

55:06.849 --> 55:09.977
You'll have to trust me.

55:10.060 --> 55:13.647
Come on. We put you in the bathtub.

55:16.358 --> 55:20.362
That's it.

55:20.445 --> 55:23.991
Okay, come on. Give me your hands.

55:25.242 --> 55:28.537
Alex. Give me your hands.

55:28.620 --> 55:31.790
I will not hurt you.

55:31.874 --> 55:35.502
Give me your hand.

55:35.586 --> 55:38.881
Okay. Come on.

55:51.268 --> 55:53.729
Now we put you to bed.

55:53.812 --> 55:56.440
Up to the legs.

55:56.523 --> 55:59.193
That's it.

56:03.739 --> 56:06.325
That's it.

56:06.408 --> 56:08.952
Now you sleep.

56:11.121 --> 56:15.042
Will you stay with me?

56:16.376 --> 56:20.923
Yes. I will,
until you fall asleep.

56:56.166 --> 56:58.919
There are busy.

57:10.389 --> 57:12.766
Hello?

57:37.791 --> 57:40.294
Fuck.

57:40.377 --> 57:42.671
For crying out loud.

57:42.754 --> 57:45.924
You scared the shit out of me.

57:50.095 --> 57:54.433
What are you looking at?

57:54.516 --> 57:57.895
Is it cool to fuck her guy?

58:00.230 --> 58:03.442
What the hell are you talking about?

58:20.042 --> 58:24.004
- Whore.
- Let me go to hell!

58:48.237 --> 58:50.614
Alex?

58:50.697 --> 58:52.908
Alex?

58:55.327 --> 58:57.412
Alex!

58:59.706 --> 59:03.210
It's okay. Quiet.

59:03.293 --> 59:05.879
You're okay.

59:05.963 --> 59:08.799
Stop that.

59:08.882 --> 59:11.260
It'll be fine.

59:14.179 --> 59:20.018
The house is occupied.
What do you think? Am I ...

59:20.102 --> 59:25.524
All was well until two weeks ago.
She went to school and everything was good.

59:25.607 --> 59:29.278
Then she moves into the house
and becomes insane.

59:29.361 --> 59:34.533
This is not normal. It is the
Each page of the book.

59:34.616 --> 59:37.369
- How do you explain this?
- Does she sleep well?

59:37.452 --> 59:42.457
No. She sleeps with me,
she dare not sleep in his own bed.

59:42.541 --> 59:45.711
I live in the same house.
Should I just put up with this?

59:45.794 --> 59:51.717
- Stay calm compared to her.
- She has scratches on the body.

59:52.843 --> 59:58.974
- Will not you talk to her?
- I'll talk to her.

01:00:20.579 --> 01:00:24.208
Hello. Not you just come in?

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:49.066
If you want me to help
you, you must talk to me.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:58.367
- You would think that I'm insane.
- Jessica has already told little.

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:02.079
It feels like
I'm going insane.

01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:06.792
It's stuff that I do not understand.

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:10.462
I can not eat. I can not sleep.

01:01:10.546 --> 01:01:15.759
I hear and see things that a
normal person can not hear and see.

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:24.184
I am not here to judge you.
I am here to help you.

01:01:27.688 --> 01:01:31.984
Do you believe in evil?

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:37.823
Something happens and this
time, I know that it's true.

01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:41.410
- What is happening?
- Stop that bullshit!

01:01:41.493 --> 01:01:45.706
You have talked with Jessica.
I know you know what I think.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:50.669
You say that you do not judge me
but you're lying!

01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:54.590
- I'm not crazy.
- There is no claiming.

01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:59.052
Is this crazy? Or this?

01:02:04.683 --> 01:02:07.603
How did this happen?

01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:16.403
- Do you think I have done it?
- There's no saying.

01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:21.825
Okay? Your mouth says something -

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:25.037
- But your eyes say something completely different.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.874
- You'll have to say it out loud.
- What?

01:02:28.957 --> 01:02:32.169
What you think is happening to you!

01:02:35.756 --> 01:02:39.009
Sorry. Sit down, Alex.

01:02:48.352 --> 01:02:50.729
Alex.

01:02:50.813 --> 01:02:53.565
What happened yesterday?

01:03:00.489 --> 01:03:04.827
There is something that takes hold of me.

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:09.915
And the worst thing is ...

01:03:09.998 --> 01:03:15.963
... I can not see it,
but I can feel it.

01:03:17.714 --> 01:03:22.928
And I know it will hurt me.

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:27.724
Alex. There is no demons.

01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:34.648
Not? Three days ago
I would have ...

01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:40.571
You know what? Forget it.

01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:44.950
- Thanks for nothing.
- Alex!

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:08.724
- What the hell have you done to me?
- You will have to go.

01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:11.977
Fucking bitch.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:18.150
Shut up and listen! You must
stop what you've done to me!

01:04:18.233 --> 01:04:21.236
I can not.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.491
If it took you,
he will not get taken.

01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:29.912
What does it mean? What will it me?

01:04:29.995 --> 01:04:33.999
It has many names.

01:04:34.082 --> 01:04:38.504
It does not matter what it wants,
it just takes it.

01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:44.676
Why did it myself?

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:50.766
The need to use a surrogate mother
for the child to be born.

01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:54.603
A surrogate mother is pure as you.

01:04:54.686 --> 01:04:58.816
Wait a minute. What child?

01:04:58.899 --> 01:05:05.447
A child in a short time
will grow inside you.

01:05:07.491 --> 01:05:13.789
It has chosen you. I'm sorry,
but there is nothing I can do.

01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:17.125
But what about me?

01:05:17.209 --> 01:05:19.920
Can I do anything?

01:05:22.506 --> 01:05:26.009
What? Tell me what to do!

01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:28.762
Will not you.

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.475
You can die.

01:05:36.228 --> 01:05:40.732
- Commit Suicide?
- It will grow inside you ...

01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:46.738
... The world has not seen
for thousands of years.

01:05:57.166 --> 01:06:03.172
- Father.
- What caused the credit?

01:06:03.255 --> 01:06:07.926
Do we need to start like this?

01:06:09.136 --> 01:06:14.558
A phone call now and then
would be nice.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:19.730
- How are you?
- There is growing hair, which should not.

01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:26.487
It disappears when it should grow.
Apart from that it goes well.

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.035
Sit. You make me nervous.

01:06:34.995 --> 01:06:38.999
What is it about?

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:46.340
I'm here because I think
that you can help me with something.

01:06:46.423 --> 01:06:52.095
There is a girl at school.
A friend of a friend.

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:55.432
She has it hard.

01:06:55.516 --> 01:06:59.937
I have talked to her a few times,
and it just gets worse and worse.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.439
What's wrong with her?

01:07:02.523 --> 01:07:07.945
That she and I think that is the problem,
are two very different things.

01:07:09.321 --> 01:07:13.992
I thought,
if you wanted to talk to her.

01:07:14.076 --> 01:07:19.706
- Why should I talk to her?
- Yes, she ...

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:22.751
She believes that ...

01:07:22.835 --> 01:07:27.464
She believes that she somehow
way have been filled.

01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:32.761
- I thought that with your ...
- No.

01:07:32.845 --> 01:07:38.517
No. I am not involved
in this sort of nonsense anymore.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.729
She has a serious mental problem
I can not process -

01:07:42.813 --> 01:07:47.401
- Before she comes to mind.
If it came from you ...

01:07:47.484 --> 01:07:51.405
You messing with things
that you should not mess with.

01:07:51.488 --> 01:07:54.116
So help me.

01:07:57.452 --> 01:08:02.958
I put it behind me long ago.
I do not want to return to it.

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:16.638
I let this lie here.

01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:24.313
Take care of yourself, Dad.

01:09:24.665 --> 01:09:26.917
- What are you doing?
- Brian!

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.045
Quiet. I came to apologize.

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:34.049
- You did not answer the phone.
- It's okay. I do not care.

01:09:36.343 --> 01:09:39.345
- What are you doing?
- Make love to me.

01:10:05.497 --> 01:10:08.333
Leave me alone!

01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:17.593
- We must leave now. Now! Run!
- What the hell was that?

01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:25.934
Alex?

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.650
Help me.

01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:00.844
Hello?

01:11:01.845 --> 01:11:04.765
Is there anybody home?

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.770
Good grief.

01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:18.779
Alex?

01:11:28.914 --> 01:11:31.500
Bree?

01:11:32.626 --> 01:11:35.087
Are you there?

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.199
Alex?

01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:09.329
Alex?

01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:13.208
Oh god.

01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:15.586
Alex. Alex.

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:18.964
Who has done this?

01:12:30.893 --> 01:12:36.857
Maybe she'll talk to me.
I'll see what I can do.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:41.153
- Hello.
- She does not say much.

01:12:41.236 --> 01:12:44.156
I have dealt with the infected wound -

01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:49.870
- But what worries me most
is how she has been damage.

01:12:49.953 --> 01:12:53.207
Do you think
that it might be her boyfriend?

01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:56.710
Brian? I do not know.

01:12:56.793 --> 01:13:01.965
- I do not know what to believe.
- Could she have done it by himself?

01:13:02.049 --> 01:13:05.844
No. Absolutely not.

01:13:08.013 --> 01:13:12.976
The police must get his girlfriend,
and then we will see what he has to say.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:17.397
We can not do so much,
if she will not cooperate.

01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:23.111
The best part is probably that you take her
home and keep an eye on her.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:28.909
I am printing her
so you can take her home.

01:13:28.992 --> 01:13:31.286
Thank you.

01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:47.219
It just does not happen.

01:13:47.302 --> 01:13:50.180
- Hello.
- Hello. What happened? Is she okay?

01:13:50.264 --> 01:13:52.975
Yes, do not worry about it.

01:13:53.058 --> 01:13:56.770
If you hear from Brian,
please let me know.

01:13:56.854 --> 01:14:00.899
- And cast him into the house.
- What happened?

01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:05.237
Do not you just do as I say?

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.198
We go upstairs. Come on.

01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:26.258
Good grief.

01:14:40.397 --> 01:14:43.192
Now we give you clothes.

01:15:14.473 --> 01:15:17.392
That stupid bitch.

01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:25.442
Reply however.

01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:29.029
What the hell are you doing?

01:15:29.112 --> 01:15:32.491
- Do you have anything you want to tell me?
- No. Why?

01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:36.370
Bree, your ...
It's just not done.

01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:40.749
- How long have you fucked him?
- Fuck off.

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:45.045
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- I've looked at his phone.

01:15:45.128 --> 01:15:48.382
- I know how often you call him.
- None of your business.

01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:51.468
It's my best friend's guy
you fucks! I do not care!

01:15:51.552 --> 01:15:55.013
How did you get on his phone?

01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:58.350
He lost it when he raped Alex.

01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:02.688
- What?
- You heard what I said.

01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:05.065
As I said:

01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:11.071
If you see him or hear from him,
please tell me. Understood?

01:16:11.155 --> 01:16:13.991
Yes.

01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:17.536
We are finished later.

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:27.880
Can I sleep in your room at night?

01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:31.133
Yes, of course, do it.

01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:09.379
Good night.

01:17:53.841 --> 01:17:56.385
Alex?

01:18:06.145 --> 01:18:08.230
Alex?

01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:24.037
Alex?

01:19:00.908 --> 01:19:05.245
Not a sound, Bree.
We have to get out of the house.

01:19:05.329 --> 01:19:10.751
- Do not sleep now. Up you go!
- Come on.

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:15.672
- Can I get dressed?
- No, do not!

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:18.300
What's going on?

01:19:25.516 --> 01:19:29.061
- What ...
- Shut up!

01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:34.024
Come on.

01:19:34.107 --> 01:19:36.360
- I need my mobile.
- No.

01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:39.071
- Do not use your mobile!
- Yes.

01:19:46.703 --> 01:19:51.500
- Alex.
- Alex does not live here, you pussy.

01:20:04.388 --> 01:20:07.266
Help! Someone!

01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:09.560
Wait. Stop.

01:20:09.643 --> 01:20:13.313
- She killed her. She is in the house.
- It'll be fine.

01:20:13.397 --> 01:20:15.983
- You're not listening.
- You must stay here.

01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:21.321
- Come with me!
- Do not go back.

01:20:21.405 --> 01:20:24.950
Stay here.
It'll be fine. Come on.

01:20:25.033 --> 01:20:30.038
- It'll be fine.
- I could not save her.

01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:33.333
Come on.

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:37.129
- We go to the car.
- She killed her.

01:20:37.212 --> 01:20:42.593
- You must come with.
- No, you have to put you in the car.

01:20:42.676 --> 01:20:47.306
I take care of you. Come on.

01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:51.894
Come on. Sit in the car. Okay.

01:20:51.977 --> 01:20:54.813
It'll be fine.

01:20:54.897 --> 01:21:00.569
Whatever happens,
you must stay in the car.

01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:26.822
It has long been a priest.

01:22:26.905 --> 01:22:30.576
Are you alone this time,
your pathetic shit?

01:22:38.208 --> 01:22:44.840
- He's with me.
- Fuck you and fuck him.

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:56.226
God, by your name save me
and my work. Hear my prayer.

01:22:56.310 --> 01:23:02.232
- You and your pathetic book.
- Lord.

01:23:02.316 --> 01:23:07.613
Stick it up your ass,
before I do it for you.

01:23:07.696 --> 01:23:11.241
Let her find a castle in You, Lord.

01:23:11.325 --> 01:23:14.703
- Go to hell.
- Let not the enemy prevail against her.

01:23:14.786 --> 01:23:19.541
- Like what you see?
- Hear my prayer.

01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:25.923
- Hear my call.
- If you are cute, you get a little.

01:23:30.844 --> 01:23:37.100
In Jesus and the Virgin Mary Name
I command you.

01:23:38.101 --> 01:23:45.067
In Father and son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:47.319
Your pig!

01:23:47.402 --> 01:23:49.822
Get out. Profile.

01:23:49.905 --> 01:23:55.744
So help me God. I will not commit
the same mistake this time.

01:25:28.962 --> 01:25:30.839
Oh god.

01:25:32.382 --> 01:25:34.635
Whore

01:26:38.699 --> 01:26:42.870
In the name of the Lord ...

01:26:44.621 --> 01:26:49.334
... I command you to show you!

01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:04.224
- Be careful what you wish for.
- Oh god.

01:27:04.308 --> 01:27:08.353
God, protect me from this ...

01:27:08.437 --> 01:27:12.774
- You speak my language.
- With Your name save me, God.

01:27:12.858 --> 01:27:17.362
- With Your Name protect my case.
- God is dead.

01:27:17.446 --> 01:27:21.950
- Let her find a castle in You.
- Shut up.

01:27:22.034 --> 01:27:26.497
Do not let her enemies
gain power over her.

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.749
Hear my prayer, O Lord!

01:27:28.832 --> 01:27:33.837
In Jesus Christ's name,
leave this child!

01:27:37.925 --> 01:27:41.428
It's too late, cocksucker!

01:27:41.512 --> 01:27:45.682
He already lives in her.

01:27:45.766 --> 01:27:49.728
- In Jesus and the Virgin Mary name ...
- Get out.

01:27:49.812 --> 01:27:52.523
... I command you.

01:27:52.606 --> 01:27:55.526
In the Father's name.

01:27:55.609 --> 01:27:59.071
The son and the Holy Spirit.

01:27:59.154 --> 01:28:02.407
I would let you make love to her.

01:28:06.453 --> 01:28:10.123
We summon our guardian angel.

01:28:12.835 --> 01:28:18.423
- Save us from all sin, O Lord.
- Maybe she ends up as the previous one.

01:28:19.925 --> 01:28:24.596
Why did not you tell me
father Madison. Why?

01:28:31.311 --> 01:28:34.648
Why did not you see her, you bastard?

01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:41.029
Save us from Your wrath, O Lord.
Save us from the devil's snares.

01:28:41.113 --> 01:28:46.785
Do the Father and of the Son and
Holy Spirit's blessings -

01:28:46.869 --> 01:28:51.248
- Get over yourselves
and follow you forever.

01:28:51.331 --> 01:28:54.835
Pray for us, holy Mother of God.

01:28:54.918 --> 01:29:00.716
We pray that you will hear us,
forgive us and save us.

01:29:00.799 --> 01:29:03.635
You can not save it here.

01:29:04.803 --> 01:29:08.056
I did not come to save her.

01:29:15.689 --> 01:29:19.193
Father.

01:29:19.276 --> 01:29:22.404
What the hell is going on?

01:29:23.322 --> 01:29:27.117
- Do not let him hurt me.
- Alex? -What the hell?

01:29:27.201 --> 01:29:31.163
- Get him away.
- Father. Good grief.

01:29:31.246 --> 01:29:35.334
Good heavens, no. Father.

01:29:48.889 --> 01:29:53.560
It's over, priest.

01:30:04.029 --> 01:30:07.324
Father, take this darkness.

01:30:07.407 --> 01:30:12.037
Tie this monster and keep it real.
Throw out the evil and protect her.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.666
He command you,
release this individual free.

01:30:15.749 --> 01:30:22.172
Banish evil.

01:30:46.822 --> 01:30:51.160
- Where is it?
- It will not be gone for long.

01:30:51.243 --> 01:30:53.829
It is still here.

01:30:53.912 --> 01:30:58.750
- It will back into you.
- No!

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.756
Good grief.

01:32:16.328 --> 01:32:19.331
No. No, Alex!

01:32:19.414 --> 01:32:21.750
Damn!

01:32:23.585 --> 01:32:28.590
Oh, God, no.
You're doing. You're doing.

01:32:28.674 --> 01:32:33.220
What have you done?
Why are you just there?

01:32:33.303 --> 01:32:36.515
Get help. Oh god.

01:32:36.598 --> 01:32:39.893
We're not going anywhere.

01:32:47.067 --> 01:32:48.986
9 Months later

01:32:49.069 --> 01:32:54.992
- That's exactly what we want.
- I think Kyle. I do not know.

01:32:55.075 --> 01:33:01.582
- What do you think? I mean it.
- I know.

01:33:01.665 --> 01:33:06.336
I just spoke with them. Everything is
in place. Do you have any questions?

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:09.631
I ... We are so happy,
that it was a boy.

01:33:09.715 --> 01:33:15.387
We have come so many names.
But I do have a question.

01:33:15.471 --> 01:33:20.976
Can you talk a little about the child's mother?
Why would she be adopt him?

01:33:26.398 --> 01:33:32.905
The boy's mother was involved in a
car accident after she was pregnant.

01:33:32.988 --> 01:33:36.158
Oh god. Is she okay?

01:33:36.241 --> 01:33:39.328
It's okay. Do not be
worried. The child is fine.

01:33:39.411 --> 01:33:42.789
You have nothing to worry for.

01:33:42.873 --> 01:33:45.542
He is a fresh boy -

01:33:45.626 --> 01:33:51.006
- And he's lucky that he gets so
loving parents like you.

01:33:51.089 --> 01:33:53.842
And what about the father?

01:33:54.305 --> 01:34:00.824
