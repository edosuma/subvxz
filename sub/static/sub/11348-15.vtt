00:06.540 --> 00:09.043
(male narrator)
In the criminal justice system,

00:10.278 --> 00:12.213
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.615
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.715 --> 00:16.417
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.517 --> 00:18.018
are members of an elite squad

00:18.119 --> 00:20.020
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.423
These are their stories.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.661
(Benson) Van 1, Benson
and Rollins on Howard Street.

00:27.761 --> 00:28.796
Party in progress.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.064
Street's quiet.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.665
What do you have on Lafayette?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.401
(Fin)
Car 1, all quiet here.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.269
still freezing our nuts off.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.271
(Amaro)
Funny, it's 70 degrees and balmy

00:37.371 --> 00:38.806
a block west on Crosby.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.142
(Benson) I'm not asking
for a weather report, guys.

00:41.242 --> 00:44.145

00:54.688 --> 00:56.357
Carisi hasn't moved
in 20 minutes.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.558
I'll goose him.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.665
Okay, yeah,
five minutes.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.467
[phone buzzes]

01:15.509 --> 01:16.744
Hey, what are we talking here?

01:16.844 --> 01:18.179
Five minutes or five hours?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.547
'Cause my wife
gets home at 11:00.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.548
Five minutes.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.549
It's worth the wait.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.583
They're young and fresh.

01:22.683 --> 01:23.484
Better be.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.522
Carisi says girls
are on their way.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.331
I got a minivan with
blacked out windows.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.276
Minivan,
two in the front.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.715
All right, chicas,
time to work.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.486
(Benson)
Wait a minute.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.788
We know this woman.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.122
That's Selena.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.424
We got her son
out of Mexico.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.293
She's back to doing
what she knows.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.660
Fin, Amaro, all units.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.629
The female handler
is known to us.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.831
(Benson) We'll have to secure
her before she gets upstairs.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.133
Copy that.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.635
Targets are in position
on Howard Street.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.304
Copy that.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.306
(Benson)
We'll get the girls,
you go up.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.811
[door buzzes]

02:25.913 --> 02:27.915
Selena.

02:27.948 --> 02:27.981
Mm-hmm.
[door buzzes]

02:30.384 --> 02:31.852
NYPD!
Let's go!

02:31.952 --> 02:32.886
Ladies, hands up.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.887
Hands up, you know the drill.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.556
Up, now!

02:35.656 --> 02:37.358
(Rollins)
Come in a line, form a "V."

02:37.458 --> 02:38.592
Come on, get your hands up.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.593
You know the drill, come on.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.828
We're going this way.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.730
Come on, come with me.
You got it?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.698
- Got it.
- Let's go, let's go.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.899
- Let's go.
- Mouths shut, entiende.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.236
How about you
shut your mouth?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.670
Up against the rail.
Let's go.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.205
No entiendo,
no habla Ingles.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.573
Save it, sweetie,

02:52.673 --> 02:53.907
'cause I know
that you speak English.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.182
Police!
Nobody move!

03:02.283 --> 03:03.217
(Amaro)
Everybody down, down.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.718
Do it now, down.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.186
Don't shoot.
I'm just getting a drink here.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.187
Put your hands
where I can see them.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.656
(Amaro)
Cover me.

03:08.689 --> 03:08.722
(Fin)
Keep your hands up.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.293
Over here.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.794
It's a private party.
It's legal.

03:13.894 --> 03:14.795
You run this place?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.297
I'm a waitress.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.565
Come on,
it's just a party.

03:17.665 --> 03:18.866
Party's over.
Get down.

03:18.966 --> 03:19.967
(Carisi)
Hey, man, I got to get home.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.201
I got to go home.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.303
Not tonight, Romeo.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.704
Everybody's going to jail.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.705
Come on.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.340
On your feet.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.875
Let's go.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.977
Come on.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.880
Come on.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.716
If you work with us,
we can help you.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.451
Podemos ayudar.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.920
I don't need your help.
I didn't do anything.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.857
After everyone's processed,

03:43.957 --> 03:45.593
take this piece of crap
into holding.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.461
- No entiendo nada.
- Yeah.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.896
(Rollins)
You had five underage girls
in your van.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.331
Entiendes that?

03:50.431 --> 03:51.699
They're all 18.
Check their IDs.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.868
We did.
They're all fake.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.671
Are those the girls?
The girls from the van?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.907
I'm guessing you already know
the answer to that question.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.442
Can--who's in charge?

04:01.542 --> 04:02.610
I need to talk
to someone, please.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.244
Please, we're losing time.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.714
You got something?
Better be good.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.652
I'm undercover.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.920
For who?

04:13.020 --> 04:15.456
I've been tracking
this ring for a year.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.525
For who?

04:19.493 --> 04:22.463
They have my daughter.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.270
[dramatic music]

05:13.914 --> 05:16.049
You better hope
this checks out.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.085
I need to talk to those girls
you picked up.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.088
Uh, Vice doesn't know you.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.357
(Rollins) You're not UC.
- I'm not a cop.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.559
My name is Martha Thornhill.
I'm from Calgary.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.095
My daughter Ariel
was kidnapped three years ago.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.830
And you think she was
taken by traffickers?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.331
I know she was.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.600
I've been tracking her
from Toronto

05:32.700 --> 05:34.368
to Minneapolis to Buffalo.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.405
I've seen her pictures
in Backstage, sex ads.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.973
They took her to New York
six months ago.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.709
Did you contact NYPD?

05:41.809 --> 05:44.344
- No.
- Why not?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.747
Toronto police
didn't believe me.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.015
Ariel was 13.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.517
We were on vacation
in Toronto.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.018
We were having lunch
at a cafe.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.021
I went to pay at the register.
I was gone two minutes tops.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.022
The police thought
my boyfriend and I

05:55.055 --> 05:55.088
had something to do
with her disappearance.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.427
- Did you?
(Martha) No.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.595
The three days
they spent grilling us,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.464
that's when we lost her.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.367
Why should we believe you?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.870
We just caught you
red-handed trafficking.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.906
Let me show you, please.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.910
(Benson)
You live here alone?

06:17.010 --> 06:19.379
Yeah, I've been here
for a couple of months.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.748
I have to keep
moving around.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.383
- Hold up.
- Okay.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.599
[light switch clicking]

06:38.699 --> 06:40.468
Liv, you got to check this out.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.656
[sighs]

07:02.756 --> 07:04.024
[camera clicking]

07:04.124 --> 07:05.693
Okay.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.529
See?
I'm not a criminal.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.130
(Benson) We're gonna have
to speak with our DA.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.599
You gotta let me go.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.467
Let you go?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.903
You told our UC underage girls
would come into that brothel.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.905
Ariel was supposed
to be there.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.172
Your daughter?
How did you know that?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.709
Ariel called me
six days ago.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.478
I gave my number
to a girl that knows her.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.214
She didn't even know
it was me.

07:27.314 --> 07:30.017
She was crying.
She said, "Mommy...

07:30.117 --> 07:32.185
they won't let me go."

07:32.285 --> 07:33.921
Who is this girl that
you gave your number to?

07:34.021 --> 07:37.625
- Oh, I can't say.
- You have to say.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.593
She doesn't know
I'm Ariel's mom.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.861
She thinks I'm a madam.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.462
She's my only connection
to Ariel.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.097
I'm not giving up
till I find my daughter.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.733
I'm just not.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.570
This woman was pretending
to be a sex trafficker.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.738
That's a new defense.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.506
But the Toronto
police confirmed

07:52.606 --> 07:55.008
that her daughter Ariel
went missing three years ago.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.210
Police suspected
her boyfriend at the time

07:57.310 --> 07:58.879
of being involved,
Brian Marks.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.714
He was a pot dealer.

08:00.748 --> 08:00.781
(Amaro)
Then Marks died of
a heroin overdose last year.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.751
Police were never able
to implicate.

08:03.851 --> 08:04.752
Trail goes cold.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.253
So Martha keeps searching.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.755
She follows leads
from Toronto

08:07.855 --> 08:09.122
to Indian reservations
on the border,

08:09.222 --> 08:11.024
Minneapolis, Chicago,
then Buffalo.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.562
I mean, local precincts
just blew her off.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.496
So she goes deeper
into the life, right,

08:16.597 --> 08:18.265
completely putting
herself at risk

08:18.365 --> 08:20.000
and pretending
to be a madam

08:20.100 --> 08:21.735
so she could get closer
to these girls.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.236
Touching story.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.838
Tell me how posing
as a criminal

08:24.938 --> 08:26.139
and engaging
in criminal activity

08:26.239 --> 08:27.741
doesn't make you a criminal?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.610
She's recorded
every single job

08:29.710 --> 08:31.011
that she's ever done,

08:31.111 --> 08:32.279
every single pimp
who's ever supplied girls

08:32.379 --> 08:33.881
to the houses
that she's worked for.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.649
I mean, she's better
than any UC we've seen.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.050
That's because
she wasn't undercover.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.786
She's an actual trafficker,
and she's done.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.520
Hold on, she's been
searching for her daughter.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.855
I understand.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.724
And assuming that she
hands over all her records

08:43.824 --> 08:44.958
and turns state's evidence,

08:45.058 --> 08:46.259
I might take that
into consideration.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.861
- Oh, you might?
- Yeah.

08:47.961 --> 08:51.098
It's taken her three years
to get this far.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.633
She's not gonna work with us

08:52.733 --> 08:54.034
unless we help her
get her daughter back.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.770
She's not going back in.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.643
Well, then maybe we
go in for her.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.846
You're gonna charge me?

09:05.946 --> 09:06.914
(Barba)
You broke the law.

09:07.014 --> 09:07.981
Kidnapping, sex trafficking.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.050
You are looking at 20 years.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.553
My daughter has been passed from
pimp to pimp for three years.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.788
I've been in New York
the past year.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.956
You've done nothing.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.324
I finally find the pimp
who has her.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.859
You decide to move in now?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.260
You're running a brothel.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.663
I'm infiltrating
to get to Ariel's pimp.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.132
You scared him off.
She might be lost forever.

09:25.165 --> 09:25.198
Martha, we're gonna keep
looking for her.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.902
Please, please,
let me keep looking.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.037
No, you're out of this game.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.571
And if you do not
want to do time,

09:31.672 --> 09:33.974
we need your names, your intel,
all of it.

09:34.074 --> 09:38.646
Martha, the girl who gave
Ariel your phone number,

09:38.746 --> 09:40.180
that's where we start.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.950
I can't.
It'll blow my cover.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.318
I promised her I wouldn't
give her away to anyone.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.987
Well, guess what, you lied.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.990
You thought that Ariel was
gonna be delivered last night?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.325
Selena told my boss
she was gonna bring seven girls.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.862
Then she calls and says
she's just gonna bring five.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.196
Her pimp held back two

09:56.296 --> 09:57.665
so that he could
discipline them.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.799
Who's the pimp?

09:58.899 --> 09:59.800
They call him Timmer.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.201
If a girl gets out of line,

10:01.301 --> 10:02.803
he boot-stomps them
in front of the others.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.337
Who told you that?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.873
I have not saved
my daughter yet,

10:05.906 --> 10:05.939
but I've bought and sent home
six girls.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.643
Bought?

10:09.743 --> 10:11.211
Yes, if a girl causes
enough trouble,

10:11.311 --> 10:12.946
a pimp will sell her for $1,200.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.081
It's a slave trade.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.182
Where do you get the money?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.250
Donations from my church.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.219
Come on, it's a cash business.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.954
The pimps deliver the girls
at the beginning of the night.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.723
When the night's over,
they take them home.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.058
They get 70%.
The house gets the rest.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.194
You were going to buy back
Ariel last night, weren't you?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.729
And her friend.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.197
The girls we picked up
should know Ariel, then.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.199
They're not gonna talk to you.
Timmer owns them.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.067
Not anymore.
And you have a choice:

10:34.167 --> 10:36.704
cooperate with us
or I'll charge you.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.074
Please, please,
please don't do this.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.943
Please, 'cause my daughter
might be lost forever.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.077
Please.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.680
I promise you,

10:46.780 --> 10:49.216
I'm gonna do everything I can
not to let that happen.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.357
You can't keep me here.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.959
You said I wasn't under arrest.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.161
You're 16 years old.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.063
There's a missing persons
report out on you

11:03.163 --> 11:04.164
from West Virginia.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.198
We can send you back home.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.035
[scoffs]
Home.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.838
My step-dad pimped me out
to begin with, so...

11:10.938 --> 11:12.672
Okay, well, we can
put you someplace safe.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.007
We're not gonna put you
back out on the street.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.943
What are you gonna do?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.444
Nail the windows shut?
Lock the doors?

11:17.544 --> 11:18.946
Like Timmer?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.449
- Who?
- I know he's rough with you.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.752
Timmer, Timmer.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.054
I've seen the photos.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.990
Hmm, this?

11:30.090 --> 11:33.360
Yeah, that's nothing.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.162
Just let me go back, okay?

11:35.262 --> 11:36.897
I've got nothing for you.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.069
Okay, listen, come here.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.741
Help me out.
Do you know this girl?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.209
Ariel?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.081
She still alive?

11:58.351 --> 12:00.253
That snow bunny?

12:00.353 --> 12:01.922
That's who this is all about?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.456
So you know her.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.358
Was she supposed to be
at the party last night?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.127
Till she mouthed off.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.462
Timmer stomped the crap
out of her in front of us.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.964
Where is she now?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.766
How long I got to stay here?

12:12.866 --> 12:13.901
I didn't do nothing.

12:14.001 --> 12:14.935
Just let me go.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.203
All right, not today, Pilar.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.205
Fine, arrest me.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.439
Timmer will post bail

12:19.539 --> 12:21.074
or throw me
to Social Services.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.342
I go to a shelter.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.377
I do the night guy.
He lets me run away.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.847
And then you call Selena.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.082
You're catching on.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.483
Lose your girlfriend.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.020
I'll do you right now,
whatever you want.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.491
Never seen her before.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.927
I don't believe you.

12:40.027 --> 12:40.928
You're lying.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.896
Where is she?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.333
We're wasting our time.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.400
In case you're wondering,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.102
Child Services
picked up your son.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.337
He's in their custody.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.839
Miguel, mijo.
How is he?

12:51.939 --> 12:53.140
What do you care?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.942
We get him out
of Mexico for you,

12:55.042 --> 12:56.243
and instead of making
a home for him,

12:56.343 --> 12:58.445
you go right back
to trafficking underage girls?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.147
I mean, you are
one hell of a mother.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.448
I was just going to a party.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.116
That's not what
the girls are saying.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.952
Lil' mamas, those girls,
all they do is lie.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.053
And you taught 'em.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.354
You know what, Nick?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.889
She is lying.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.158
I'm out of here.
I'm wasting my time.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.392
What about Miguel?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.294
What about him?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.528
No one's gonna
let you post bail,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.464
so he'll go into foster care.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.132
And there is not a judge
in New York

13:19.232 --> 13:20.500
who will ever let you
have him back.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.035
And once you get sent upstate,

13:22.135 --> 13:24.271
you're gonna see him
once a year, maybe.

13:29.877 --> 13:30.844
Man.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.145
Let's get out of here.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.847
Forgetting about
this desgraciada

13:43.056 --> 13:44.958
After we walked out
on Selena,

13:45.525 --> 13:46.059
she had a lawyer call.

13:46.793 --> 13:47.560
She wants to see
her son again.

13:48.595 --> 13:48.628
Well, I hope you didn't
make her any promises.

13:49.229 --> 13:49.963
Did she give up Timmer?

13:50.763 --> 13:51.431
No, but she did give us
an address

13:52.532 --> 13:52.565
to a party house in Queens,
Hollis Court Boulevard,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.302
says she and Timmer
rotate girls there.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.870
Okay, anything
on the owners?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.906
LLCs within LLCs,
you know how it is.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.107
Martha, do you
recognize this?

14:00.207 --> 14:01.208
I've been there.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.375
The madam's name is Tracy.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.610
(Benson)
Okay, do we run the block?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.078
Yeah, well, it's a rough crowd.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.280
In the last six months,
five 911 calls

14:07.380 --> 14:09.249
for assault,
for drunk driving.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.518
They were all investigated,
but no charges were filed.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.386
Somebody's paying off
that precinct.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.422
How about I go in,
I get eyes inside?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.057
How about we stake it out first

14:17.157 --> 14:18.591
so we know what it is
we're dealing with?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.961
But if you see Ariel,
you move in.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.196
We will, if we can.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.440
They start early.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.975
It's the lunch rush.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.510
[camera shutter snapping]

14:40.380 --> 14:42.149
[indistinct chatter]

14:42.249 --> 14:44.151
Think we got our Timmer.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.187
[indistinct chatter]

14:49.389 --> 14:51.458
Three girls.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.893
(Fin)
Different crowd from Manhattan.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.895
More ethnic.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.430
(Rollins)
Selena's tip was good.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.932
Well, that won't
help her cause.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.134
Look, I don't see
our girl, do you?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.602
No.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.104
Maybe she's on the other side
of the van.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.372
Hey, do you guys see Ariel?

15:05.472 --> 15:06.974
Not yet.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.010
[indistinct shouting]

15:14.281 --> 15:16.349
This girl's not gonna make it.

15:16.449 --> 15:20.287
There's always one
having a bad day.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.289
That could be Tracy.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.525
(Fin) She must be pissed 'cause
that girl's strung out.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.094
(Rollins)
Can you tell what's going on?

15:27.194 --> 15:29.262
Maybe she's not happy
with the delivery.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.264
She sent him back
for more girls.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.699
Okay, copy.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.168
Well, let's follow him
back to the nest.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.538
We're staying with the van.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.473
Copy, we'll stay
with the house.

15:40.507 --> 15:40.540
Looks like Carisi's driving.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.410
Great.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.984
Okay, slow down, fly boy.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.653
I got it.
I got it.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.155
He'll lose him.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.389
Give Carisi a break.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.558
You want to bet?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.227
Hold up.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.535
We got a supplier.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.013
Easy, easy, man.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.381
That's what I'm doing.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.721
(Fin)
Damn.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.023
He's testing us.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.624
So what?
Do a yoo-ee too?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.160
Nah, he's not stupid.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.461
Let him go.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.465
He's coming
right back past us.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.167
I told you Carisi
would lose him.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.369
Okay, Nick, relax, okay?
The guy made a U-turn.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.737
Now none of us can follow him
without setting off alarms.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.239
- He was smart.
- Yeah, I'll relax.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.741
- But we got nothing.
- Okay, maybe.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.379
We still got our
beer delivery guy, right?

16:52.479 --> 16:54.013
Illegal delivery of alcohol

16:54.114 --> 16:56.716
to an unlicensed,
noncommercial establishment?

16:56.816 --> 16:58.351
Yeah, it is worth
a conversation.

16:58.451 --> 17:02.155
Let's--let's give them
some lead, all right?

17:02.255 --> 17:05.525
We don't want to pull him over
anywhere near this house.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.727
You know why
we pulled you over?

17:07.827 --> 17:08.761
Tommy?

17:08.861 --> 17:09.796
I don't know.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.198
Missed your quota last month?

17:11.298 --> 17:12.399
How about illegal distribution

17:12.499 --> 17:13.800
of alcohol
to a residence.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.502
They're having a party.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.604
Does your boss know
you deliver to a brothel?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.473
Or your wife?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.109
You guys kidding me?

17:22.209 --> 17:23.610
Come on, man,
I'm trying to make a living.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.379
Yeah, sounds like
an admission to me.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.380
[cuffs clicking]

17:27.480 --> 17:28.815
There you go, okay.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.288
That's Timmer.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.158
Okay, Martha, anyone else?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.559
I know that Asian girl.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.663
That's Nina.
That's Ariel's friend.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.665
That's who I gave
my number to.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.267
Okay, good, keep going.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.535
Um...

17:52.305 --> 17:53.573
No Ariel.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.744
Nina says Timmer
uses her a lot.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.813
Either...

18:00.913 --> 18:03.316
she's injured, or...

18:03.416 --> 18:04.617
Listen to me, Martha.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.619
We're doing everything
we can, all right?

18:06.719 --> 18:09.088
I'm gonna get started on these.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.357
And I want you to keep looking

18:10.457 --> 18:11.691
to see if you recognize
anyone else.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.360
I'll be right back.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.096
Martha identified
two of the girls

18:17.197 --> 18:18.331
and the pimp, Timmer.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.332
You run the plates?

18:19.432 --> 18:20.633
Upstate rental minivan.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.202
It's licensed
to a nonexistent church.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.436
(Fin)
The guy's cautious.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.172
He makes sure
no one can follow him.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.773
So far, he hasn't crossed
any bridges or tunnels.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.209
Okay, so we know that the girls
are housed in Queens.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.877
But no sign of Ariel?

18:30.977 --> 18:32.679
Not even in a disguise?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.547
No, most of these girls
were ethnic.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.583
I mean, it's a lower-rent crowd
than the loft.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.186
A little white girl like Ariel
would be considered high-class.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.487
Could be a special request.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.289
Snow bunnies bring in
the big bucks.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.690
We need to get
into that house.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.891
(Rollins)
Tomorrow's Super Bowl Sunday.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.326
And we grabbed
half of his girls

18:46.426 --> 18:47.427
at the Manhattan loft.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.695
So he is going to be working

18:48.795 --> 18:51.164
every single one of them
that he's got.

18:51.264 --> 18:54.567
It's also a big day
for beer delivery.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.303
Your friend Tommy,
he lawyer up yet?

18:56.403 --> 18:57.570
Not yet.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.706
I think he's afraid
of calling his wife.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.908
I told you,
I deliver beer.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.443
That is all I do.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.312
You never get
a little on the side?

19:05.412 --> 19:07.214
You want to honestly
sit there and tell us

19:07.314 --> 19:09.249
that you don't know
what goes on in that house?

19:09.282 --> 19:09.316
Well, it doesn't take
a rocket scientist--

19:14.754 --> 19:17.324
If I help you guys out,

19:17.424 --> 19:18.591
you let me go home?

19:18.691 --> 19:19.759
We'll see.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.828
Same girls every day, hmm?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.496
No, it varies.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.597
They mix it up.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.632
Different girls,
I don't know,

19:25.732 --> 19:26.833
every couple weeks.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.501
How about for special events?

19:28.601 --> 19:31.438
They bring the best girls
and invite the best clients.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.473
150 bucks just
to get in the door.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.707
It's very high-class.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.943
Those are big delivery days
for me.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.645
Kind of like
Super Bowl Sunday.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.380
That's why you got to let me
go back there tomorrow.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.614
It's my biggest day
of the year.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.182
Tell you what.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.252
We'll take that delivery
off your hands.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.793
(Rollins)
Surveillance shows a few pimps
and five girls already inside.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.262
(Amaro)
Okay, got it.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.564
Okay, give us the word
as soon as you get in.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.599
Rollins and Carisi will cover.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.235
You get a bad feeling,
you get out of there.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.370
(Amaro)
Okay.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.406
[knocking]

20:06.506 --> 20:08.207
Hey.
Who are you?

20:08.308 --> 20:09.509
Tommy sent me.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.943
One of his kids is sick
or something.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.612
No, he should have called.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.880
Damn, lady, why don't you
call him yourself?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.348
I'm just doing him
a favor here.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.583
I got eight cases here,
more in the van,

20:16.683 --> 20:17.717
and it's a busy day.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.819
Do you want 'em or not,
huh?

20:19.919 --> 20:20.820
All right, come on.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.455
All right, now.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.691
(Amaro)
Where do you want 'em?

20:24.791 --> 20:26.359
(Woman)
Table.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.527
Here's good?

20:27.627 --> 20:29.662
That's the table, ain't it?

20:29.762 --> 20:31.531
Hey, how you doing?

20:35.502 --> 20:36.969
Hey, how old are these girls?

20:37.069 --> 20:38.705
What do you care?

20:38.805 --> 20:39.839
NYPD.

20:39.939 --> 20:40.973
Hands where I can see them.
Hey.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.709
NYPD!
Hands up!

20:42.809 --> 20:44.444
Hands, now.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.679
Put those phones
down on the table now.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.980
Get down.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.981
You serving minors, huh?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.417
What the hell is this?

20:50.517 --> 20:52.485
You shaking me down
on Super Bowl Sunday?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.854
Consider it
a hostile takeover.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.597
This house
is now our house.

21:05.332 --> 21:05.732
Which one of these
is your phone?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.334
The leopard one.

21:08.234 --> 21:08.901
If you're the cops,
where's the warrant?

21:09.669 --> 21:10.437
It's on its way.
Now listen to me.

21:11.304 --> 21:11.838
If you work with us,
we'll work with you.

21:12.505 --> 21:12.972
What are you talking about?

21:13.773 --> 21:14.874
The party is gonna
go on as planned.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.576
But you're gonna tell us
who's coming.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.578
How many johns, pimps, girls.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.279
(Fin)
No surprises.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.714
And when they bust them,
we're gonna bust you too.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.316
You make it look good,

21:23.416 --> 21:24.817
nobody's gonna ever know
that you cooperated.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.319
If I say no?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.621
Amanda, how many
underage girls

21:28.721 --> 21:30.623
- you got over there?
- We got two.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.692
You say no, you're talking
federal charges.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.826
I didn't know, I swear.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.861
Save it.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.463
This girl...

21:36.563 --> 21:37.830
She ever work here?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.432
Haven't seen her in a week.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.900
Maybe she got arrested.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.569
She didn't.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.003
Make some calls,
get her here.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.605
Yo, I don't even know
who she with.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.306
(Carisi)
Well, find out.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.008
And then tell the pimp
that you got a special request.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.477
You got a whale here
who's willing

21:50.577 --> 21:53.380
to pay top dollar
for snow bunnies.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.581
I'll do what I can.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.549
Yeah, you will.
Stand up.

21:56.583 --> 21:56.616
Un-cuff her.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.919
Listen, anybody asks,
I'm Bethany.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.388
I'm here to help you out
for the day.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.655
And I'm your new supplier.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.491
I'm with some girls here
fresh from vice.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.758
And I'm your whale.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.093
Make the call.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.666
I need six of the
youngest-looking UCs you've got,

22:13.766 --> 22:15.334
appropriately dressed.

22:15.435 --> 22:19.005
I also need the house
wired for sound and video.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.607
Yes, today.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.742
ASAP, thank you.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.110
So Ariel will be
at the party?

22:24.210 --> 22:25.612
We've put in a request.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.879
Timmer said that
he'd make some calls.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.448
Okay, okay, all right,
I'll come with.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.016
No, no, Martha.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.584
That's not happening.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.052
I know Tracy and Timmer.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.454
I know how they work.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.888
Listen, you need
to go to your apartment.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.690
You need to take care
of yourself and get some sleep.

22:37.790 --> 22:38.958
I don't sleep.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.993
I've slept a total
of two hours a night

22:41.093 --> 22:42.495
over the past three years.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.697
When Ariel's back,
I will sleep.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.367
I don't know how
you're still standing.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.769
Well, moms don't sleep.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.037
You know that.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.672
They told me
you have a little boy.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.073
Does he ever get sick?

22:55.842 --> 22:56.909
Too often.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.478
Oh, when Ariel was little,

22:58.578 --> 22:59.946
she used to get
the worst ear infections.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.147
She couldn't sleep.

23:01.247 --> 23:02.615
If I left the room,
she'd cry.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.683
So I'd have to sit
by her side.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.485
I would read, I would sing,

23:05.585 --> 23:06.853
till she fell asleep.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.721
And then I would just
sit and watch her.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.156
I wasn't tired at all.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.591
I want that back.

23:11.691 --> 23:12.892
I want her back.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.795
Please, let me be there.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.470
Are you going
to a Super Bowl party?

23:23.570 --> 23:26.405
Um...something like that.

23:26.506 --> 23:29.008
Well, I'm glad
you're getting out.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.077
[doorbell dings]
Ah, that's my date.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.479
Oh, do you want me
to get it?

23:32.579 --> 23:33.846
Come here, yeah.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.081
- Come here, big boy.
- He wants to go to you.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.449
- Come here, big boy.
- There you go.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.584
I'm gonna miss you.

23:37.684 --> 23:38.885
I'm gonna miss you tonight.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.019
But you know what?

23:40.119 --> 23:42.755
Next week, just you and me.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.156
All week.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.760
Ready to roll?

23:47.860 --> 23:50.096
Ha, let's do this.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.464
Okay.

23:51.564 --> 23:52.465
Good night, little love.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.601
Love you.
Love you.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.642
Okay, player, is this more
like what you're looking for?

24:02.742 --> 24:04.877
Oh, you a Seahawks fan?

24:04.977 --> 24:07.880
I'll make sure nothing's
under-inflated tonight.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.483
You do that, baby.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.151
(Carisi) So you want to put your
money on the Pats, all right?

24:12.251 --> 24:13.886
They're gonna make sure
New England wins this,

24:13.986 --> 24:15.488
even if they got to rig
the last play of the game.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.623
(Man)
Come on, now.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.190
All right, let's go, ladies.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.759
Mix, mingle.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.561
Gonna be busy tonight.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.497
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.798
Who the hell is she?

24:25.898 --> 24:27.700
She's my sister-in-law Bethany.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.669
Works a house
in Nassau County.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.070
I told you
I needed the help.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.705
We expecting a big night.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.206
Are those your girls?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.075
Which ones do special requests?

24:36.175 --> 24:37.777
[laughs]

24:37.877 --> 24:39.579
They do what
I tell them to do.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.681
That's what I like to hear.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.850
You let me know
if you need anything.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.754
Will do.
[chuckles]

24:47.854 --> 24:50.022
(Martha)
You said she was
going to be here.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.891
Where's Ariel?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.626
Carisi says
he hasn't seen her.

24:53.726 --> 24:57.196
She's not working tonight.

24:57.296 --> 25:00.032
Wait.
Who's that?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.035
(Martha)
It's not a car I know.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.173
Hey.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.875
Where's my blonde, huh?

25:08.975 --> 25:10.276
The skinny one
with the nice rack?

25:10.376 --> 25:11.678
She'll be here, but...

25:11.778 --> 25:12.845
while you're waiting--

25:12.945 --> 25:14.146
Why don't you let
my girl Nina

25:14.246 --> 25:15.281
take care of you, huh?

25:15.381 --> 25:16.916
There we go.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.752
He has money.

25:19.852 --> 25:20.953
Is Ariel actually coming?

25:21.053 --> 25:22.154
She'll be here, okay?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.256
Let me make
another phone call.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.097
Mystery pimp just pulled up
in the driveway.

25:32.899 --> 25:36.035
Timmer was the last pimp
on that list that Tracy gave us.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.841
Then we got a problem.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.042
Hey.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.811
Who just arrived in
the black Escalade?

25:44.911 --> 25:46.178
The Bishop.
His ass crazy.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.581
Timmer must have
called him about Ariel.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.983
But he's alone.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.054
You like that, baby?
I know you do.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.158
(The Bishop)
Timmer.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.196
Who are these trespassers?
I don't know them.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.636
I'm with Tracy.
We're all friends here.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.771
You're no friend of mine, ma'am.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.742
- Aah, what the--
- Shut up, bitch.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.644
Hey, you.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.779
Never speak to
a woman like that.

26:19.879 --> 26:20.913
You're done.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.214
The game hasn't
even started yet.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.651
- Back off.
- Yours is over.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.185
Who are you?
I don't know you.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.186
(The Bishop)
Now you do!

26:27.286 --> 26:28.187
[men shouting]

26:28.287 --> 26:29.656
Take it easy, man.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.691
I don't know you either,
Superfly.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.793
That's it,
this party's over!

26:33.893 --> 26:37.664
Drop your gun.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.065
You're sick, boyo.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.933
I pray you didn't invite
a pig to the party.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.644
All right, all right, darling.

26:52.144 --> 26:52.745
Just take it easy.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.280
I said drop the gun.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.317
Tracy, tell your bitch here
to take a step back.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.052
NYPD!

27:00.152 --> 27:01.187
(Rollins)
Drop the weapon!

27:01.287 --> 27:02.388
Come on, man!

27:02.488 --> 27:04.156
Everybody drop your weapons.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.624
- You sold me out, you're dead.
- I didn't, man!

27:05.725 --> 27:07.026
- You're dead!
- I didn't!

27:07.126 --> 27:08.728
I didn't, man.
I swear to you I didn't!

27:08.828 --> 27:11.998
Everybody here
is under arrest.

27:12.098 --> 27:12.999
Give me that gun.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.633
Turn around.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.040
Do I want to know
why you're dressed like that?

27:23.375 --> 27:24.944
We were undercover
at a brothel,

27:25.044 --> 27:26.078
and before we could--

27:26.178 --> 27:27.346
Wait, back up.
Who's we?

27:27.446 --> 27:29.315
Me, Fin, Carisi,
the whole squad.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.050
The whole squad was
undercover at a brothel

27:31.150 --> 27:32.384
on Super Bowl Sunday?

27:32.484 --> 27:33.920
We don't need
to get your approval.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.387
And we made some good arrests,

27:35.487 --> 27:36.956
and Martha ID'd Timmer.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.357
Martha was there?

27:38.457 --> 27:40.993
I told you she
couldn't be involved.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.862
Sorry.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.731
Sorry?
That's it?

27:44.831 --> 27:46.699
Actually, what I was
trying to tell you

27:46.799 --> 27:49.235
is that before
we could rescue Ariel,

27:49.335 --> 27:53.105
Declan shows up,
deep undercover as a trafficker.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.273
And we had to arrest him.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.674
Declan Murphy,
your former lieutenant.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.777
Undercover for whom, vice?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.779
I can't speak to that.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.213
See if he can.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.191
Yo, what's up?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.392
You sold us out.

28:13.492 --> 28:14.927
- It wasn't me--
- Not a word.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.328
We'll cut your balls off,
salt them,

28:16.428 --> 28:18.197
and feed them to the seagulls,
you understand?

28:18.297 --> 28:19.999
Yeah, man.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.801
I said yes.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.339
You two, out.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.208
And you.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.177
No, you, come on.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.745
Take your ugly friend
with you.

28:32.845 --> 28:33.746
I don't know that dude.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.447
He's crazy, man.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.749
(Carisi)
Hey.

28:36.849 --> 28:37.950
Hey, what about me?

28:38.050 --> 28:40.186
Hey, shut up.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.988
You made us miss the game.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.928
What the hell are you doing?
You put a gun in my face,

28:49.028 --> 28:50.462
then you pistol whip
one of our guys?

28:50.562 --> 28:51.964
That mouse job's
one of yours?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.199
Okay, let's do
the introductions later.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.266
You want to tell us
what the hell

28:54.366 --> 28:55.267
you were doing back there?

28:55.367 --> 28:57.069
I should ask you the same thing!

28:57.169 --> 28:58.771
Nine months I'm embedding
myself in the trafficking ring,

28:58.871 --> 29:00.339
and you want to blow it
with a Super Bowl vice bust?

29:00.439 --> 29:01.941
That's the dumbest,
riskiest day of the year.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.342
Okay, we're looking
for a trafficked girl.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.811
Just one?

29:04.911 --> 29:06.378
I thought I taught you
to think big.

29:06.478 --> 29:07.814
I'm tracking hundreds.
I'm working for Johnny D.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.115
Johnny D?
We don't know him.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.749
Of course you don't.

29:10.850 --> 29:11.750
That's what took me nine months
to figure out.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.019
And now, thanks to you,

29:13.119 --> 29:14.253
I'm gonna have to spend
a week at Rikers

29:14.353 --> 29:15.254
until that gun charge
is dropped.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.522
I hand the reins to you,

29:16.622 --> 29:17.824
and you gotta bollocks
everything up?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.158
Okay,I missed you
too, Declan.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.360
We're looking for this girl.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.830
- Ariel.
(Fin) She alive?

29:23.930 --> 29:25.164
In a sense.
She's damaged goods.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.498
Your friend Timmer
did a number on her

29:26.598 --> 29:28.000
before he sold her
to Johnny D.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.168
800 bucks is all he got.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.402
Where does Johnny D keep her?

29:30.502 --> 29:32.004
He's just bought girls from me.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.040
He's never taken me
to his lair.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.107
Buying, wow.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.208
So now you're trafficking.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.343
I'm earning his trust.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.979
And you do not relay that
to 1 PP.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.280
Then you...

29:41.380 --> 29:42.815
You tell Johnny D

29:42.915 --> 29:44.116
that you want to buy
Ariel from him.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.551
You overplayed that hand.

29:45.651 --> 29:46.953
He's too smart.
He'll smell the trap.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.554
Listen to me.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.389
I made a promise
to that girl's mother.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.859
That's a promise you're
not gonna be able to keep.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.493
It's too late for Ariel.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.362
Those girls are so broken,
they won't save themselves.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.529
No one's gonna talk.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.965
Johnny D doesn't think twice

29:59.065 --> 30:01.033
about killing
some whore or pimp.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.435
Even a cop.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.104
If alone with him,
given the chance,

30:05.204 --> 30:06.906
I'll put a shiv in him
and just walk away.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.274
But you got to put me
back in holding

30:08.374 --> 30:09.876
before you make
this whole thing worse.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.177
Now, please.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.025
(Rollins)
Do you know her?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.127
Her name's Ariel.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.228
I know lots of people.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.830
Come on, where is she?

30:31.931 --> 30:34.300
Nina, helping us
is helping yourself.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.302
I say a word to you,
and Timmer does to me

30:36.402 --> 30:39.238
exactly what he did to her.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.606
What did he do to her?

30:48.114 --> 30:49.982
Everything was supposed to be
all set and ready to go.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.117
This lady pimp...

30:51.217 --> 30:52.118
Martha?

30:52.218 --> 30:53.385
Yeah, Martha.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.122
She was gonna buy us.

30:56.222 --> 30:59.191
Then Timmer walked in on Ariel
on the phone with her,

30:59.291 --> 31:03.229
and he beat her
until she blacked out.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.631
So just call Timmer's lawyer.

31:05.731 --> 31:08.867
I don't want to die.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.536
[whispering]
I almost got my daughter killed.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.906
You were trying to save her.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.141
Let me talk to Nina.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.375
She knows more
than she's letting on.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.543
She's not gonna help us.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.878
Please.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.380
Please.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.019
I asked for a lawyer.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.355
And I asked
to talk to you first.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.556
You came on like a madam,

31:30.656 --> 31:33.059
said you were gonna
take care of us.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.260
You're just another cop.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.461
I'm not a cop.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.662
I'm Ariel's mother.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.430
[scoffs]
Can't be.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.967
Her mom's boyfriend pimped
her out in Canada somewhere.

31:41.067 --> 31:44.370
It's not true.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.272
I've been looking for Ariel

31:46.372 --> 31:48.240
since the day
she disappeared.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.952
Ariel has a real mom.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.259
Nobody ever came
looking for me.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.560
Who told you that?

32:10.729 --> 32:12.264
Timmer.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.033
And you believed him?

32:16.002 --> 32:17.236
What do you want from me?

32:17.336 --> 32:19.271
I just want my daughter.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.672
I don't care if you testify.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.009
I don't care about anything.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.177
Just tell me where she is.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.118
I'm sorry.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.387
Nina...

32:37.423 --> 32:39.591
Please, where is she?

32:45.297 --> 32:46.498
Look, this is how it is.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.134
The morning after he beat her,

32:48.234 --> 32:51.537
Timmer drove her to hell.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.005
He killed her?

32:53.105 --> 32:55.507
He took her to Johnny D.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.409
Timmer always talks
about how lucky we are

32:57.509 --> 32:59.145
to be with him.

32:59.245 --> 33:02.648
Johnny D keeps his new girls
chained up for a whole week,

33:02.748 --> 33:04.150
lets all these pimps come in,

33:04.250 --> 33:06.985
do whatever they want to them.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.520
That's how he breaks them.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.495
So this whole thing
was a setup, huh?

33:16.595 --> 33:18.164
So what?

33:18.264 --> 33:20.099
I was at
a Super Bowl party, baby.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.333
Come on, we know
you're a pimp.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.702
We've been following you
for a year.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.438
We tapped your phones,

33:26.538 --> 33:29.208
bugged your house,
and turnt your girls.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.742
(Rollins)
Selena, your bottom,
we embedded her.

33:30.842 --> 33:35.147
Martha, the madam,
another UC.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.348
It's over.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.549
Nobody's afraid
of you anymore.

33:37.649 --> 33:38.617
[laughs]

33:38.717 --> 33:40.319
Listen, sweetheart.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.521
I'm a local businessman,
huh?

33:42.621 --> 33:44.423
With ties to the community.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.125
So...

33:46.225 --> 33:48.260
I think I'll call
my lawyer now, huh?

33:48.360 --> 33:49.561
[smooches]

33:49.661 --> 33:51.029
[laughs]

33:54.533 --> 33:56.202
So that's it?
It's over now?

33:56.302 --> 33:58.737
Not yet.
The know what they're doing.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.772
You don't need a lawyer.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.208
Well, it's my right.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.543
We're releasing you
and the Bishop.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.213
Illegal search.

34:07.313 --> 34:09.281
Now, Bishop thinks
you set him up,

34:09.381 --> 34:10.682
and Johnny D.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.684
So they gonna be waiting on you
when you get outside.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.553
Come on, player,
nobody snitching on them.

34:14.653 --> 34:15.554
That doesn't matter.

34:15.654 --> 34:16.688
It matters
what it looks like,

34:16.788 --> 34:18.690
and it looks
like you set him up.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.659
I'm not even looking
at you right now.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.294
I'm looking at a dead man.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.396
Your body just doesn't know it.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.132
I ain't set nobody up,
all right?

34:26.232 --> 34:27.366
Okay, so you want to live.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.268
Where is Ariel?

34:43.682 --> 34:46.385
NYPD!

34:46.485 --> 34:48.354
No, no, please, don't!
Please don't...

34:48.454 --> 34:49.421
Okay, take it easy.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.556
I got you.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.159
[crying]
Please, no, please.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.493
It's all right,
you're okay.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.262
You're okay.
You're safe.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.264
- You're safe.
- Over there.

34:58.364 --> 35:01.700
I got it.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.436
Hey, hey, listen,
you're okay.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.172
It's all right.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.740
[speaks Spanish]

35:08.840 --> 35:10.576
Hey, I need an ambulance!

35:10.676 --> 35:12.711
So far, three girls,
all in bad shape.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.846
No sign of Ariel?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.715
[girl screaming,
metal clattering]

35:16.815 --> 35:18.684
(girl)
Let go of me!

35:18.784 --> 35:20.819
Someone help!
Please help!

35:20.919 --> 35:22.821
Let go of me!
Stop it!

35:22.921 --> 35:24.223
Hey!
Put your hands up.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.825
(Rollins)
Let her go.

35:26.925 --> 35:27.893
(Amaro)
Drop the glass.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.661
Drop it now!

35:40.639 --> 35:43.875
Johnny D, it's over,
all right?

35:44.310 --> 35:45.477
(Benson)
Hey.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.913
Let her go.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.548
This is the girl you want?

35:49.648 --> 35:50.916
Say good-bye.

35:50.949 --> 35:50.982
You kill her,
you die too.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.322
Is she really worth it?

36:03.529 --> 36:04.930
Let her go.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.701
I want my lawyer.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.203
(Amaro)
Drop the glass.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.772
Hands against the door.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.541
- Come on.
(Amaro) Spread your legs.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.444
(Amaro)
Hands behind your back.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.417
[whispering]
Thank you.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.718
Thank you.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.532
Ariel.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.853
Mommy?

37:01.953 --> 37:03.889
Yeah.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.857
Mommy's here.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.459
You're safe.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.927
You're safe.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.435
It's okay.

37:16.535 --> 37:17.969
You're safe now.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.308
You're safe.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.498
Thank you, Amanda.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.000
You've been under
a long time.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.469
You okay?

37:52.638 --> 37:54.340
I'm fine.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.941
Some of these girls
are telling me

37:55.974 --> 37:56.007
that you actually
pimped them out.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.746
You can't believe
a word they say.

38:00.846 --> 38:01.880
They're liars.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.316
Huh.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.784
What about you?

38:05.884 --> 38:07.986
You walking the walk?

38:08.086 --> 38:09.321
Yeah, I hit a rough patch.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.690
But...
what doesn't kill you...

38:11.790 --> 38:14.560
Makes you a better detective.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.027
[door opens]

38:17.763 --> 38:19.064
Heard you found your girl.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.399
We did.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.300
How is she?

38:22.401 --> 38:24.002
Bruising, fractured ribs.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.572
That'll heal.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.906
The rest, though...

38:28.006 --> 38:30.342
One can only pray.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.943
So we took your man down.

38:32.043 --> 38:35.013
Found him in his lair with
four sex slaves as prisoners.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.883
He'll be going away for life,
for federal charges.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.518
Maybe.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.453
He's trafficked
for over 20 years,

38:41.553 --> 38:43.689
no paper trail,
not a single arrest.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.624
Do not turn your back on him.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.762
Can you come in
from the cold now?

38:50.862 --> 38:52.631
You want me back in charge
that badly?

38:52.731 --> 38:55.434
Hmm.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.902
Johnny D. was
the king.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.504
For the time being,
he's out of commission.

38:58.604 --> 38:59.705
That makes me
the heir apparent.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.440
The gun charge.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.741
You should be ashamed
of yourselves

39:02.841 --> 39:03.875
for the illegal search.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.577
It'll get dropped.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.012
I'll be back out on the streets
in no time.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.014
And every trafficker
in the Northeast

39:09.114 --> 39:10.348
will be kissing my ring.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.117
So make it look good.

39:13.919 --> 39:14.886
Cuffs?

39:14.986 --> 39:16.388
By the book.

39:18.624 --> 39:21.627
[cuffs clicking]

39:23.995 --> 39:25.831
Till we meet again.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.538
You have a good team here.

39:32.638 --> 39:33.672
Take care of yourselves.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.707
You too, Declan.

39:46.752 --> 39:47.886
(Judge)
John Drake,

39:47.986 --> 39:49.888
otherwise known as Johnny D,

39:49.988 --> 39:50.956
how do you plead?

39:51.056 --> 39:53.091
100% not guilty,
your honor.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.560
(Judge)
Counselor?

39:54.660 --> 39:55.561
Not guilty, your honor.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.028
We request R.O.R.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.764
My client has never had
so much as a parking ticket.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.832
Your honor, he was found
in a hell hole

40:00.932 --> 40:03.001
with girls imprisoned
as sex slaves.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.470
He knows nothing about that.

40:04.570 --> 40:05.937
They were girls he trafficked,

40:06.037 --> 40:07.138
bought and sold.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.940
He was taken while holding
a piece of glass

40:09.040 --> 40:10.408
to one victim's neck.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.077
He was also being held
against his will

40:12.177 --> 40:14.480
when who he perceived
as strangers burst in.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.881
The minute he understood
it was police,

40:15.981 --> 40:17.483
he surrendered.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.884
Your honor, he's looking
at life in prison.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.452
He has the means to flee.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.887
There may be other women
in jeopardy.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.555
If ever a situation
called for remand--

40:23.655 --> 40:24.890
Agreed.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.492
Mr. Drake, you are remanded

40:26.592 --> 40:28.627
to a federal penitentiary
pending trial.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.028
[gavel pounds]

40:32.764 --> 40:33.832
Can you help me?

40:33.932 --> 40:34.833
Turn it, ready?

40:34.933 --> 40:35.834
Go, and--

40:35.934 --> 40:37.503
Hello, young friend.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.004
Good.
Good one--

40:39.104 --> 40:41.607
[doorbell dings]

40:41.707 --> 40:42.974
Huh.

40:43.074 --> 40:44.576
Who's that at our door?

40:46.144 --> 40:48.013
Who's that at our door?

40:50.982 --> 40:52.183
Melinda.

40:54.185 --> 40:55.887
Everything okay?

40:55.987 --> 40:57.556
I'm sorry to bother you
at home,

40:57.656 --> 41:00.158
but I wanted to keep this
off the books.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.828
- Oh, okay, come on in.
- Thanks.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.767
Keep what off the books?

41:08.867 --> 41:11.236
I need to know
the legal status

41:11.336 --> 41:12.638
of your relationship
with Noah.

41:12.738 --> 41:13.639
What?
Why?

41:13.739 --> 41:14.806
Just tell me.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.642
Have you started
the adoption process?

41:16.742 --> 41:19.177
Well, there's a pile
of paperwork.

41:19.277 --> 41:22.981
But the second that I'm
allowed to adopt him, I will.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.651
What's going on?

41:25.751 --> 41:27.886
There was a hit...

41:27.986 --> 41:30.756
on Johnny Drake's DNA
when it went through the system.

41:30.856 --> 41:34.025
It was a familial match
in an unrelated case,

41:34.125 --> 41:37.228
and not discoverable
in Drake's current case.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.630
He never needs to know.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.032
Needs to know what?

41:41.132 --> 41:42.634
What are you saying?

41:42.734 --> 41:44.636
What I'm trying to tell you...

41:44.736 --> 41:47.072
Johnny D is Noah's father.
