WEBVTT

00:07.920 --> 00:09.911
HATI'IESBURG, MISSISSIPPI

00:32.170 --> 00:34.411
Want to get out
of your seatbelt for me?

00:34.420 --> 00:35.910
I did it!

00:35.920 --> 00:38.662
Yeah, Mama.

00:38.670 --> 00:40.820
I always do it. It's so easy!

00:40.830 --> 00:42.707
Is it so easy?

00:42.710 --> 00:45.998
-Let's go see your Auntie Sue.
-Oh, I'm so excited.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.450
Where's Hillary the Hippo?

00:48.460 --> 00:51.748
Where is Hillary the Hippo?I don't know!

00:51.750 --> 00:53.206
Oh, my goodness!

00:53.210 --> 00:55.417
-Do you think_I'd forget her?

00:55.420 --> 00:57.615
Thanks, Mom. Can I go play in that?

00:57.620 --> 01:01.454
I don't know.
You have to ask your Aunt Sue first.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.872
Well, who is this little house mouse?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.450
It's me!

01:05.460 --> 01:08.167
Hello, me. Nice to meet you. I'm Sue.

01:08.170 --> 01:09.614
You're silly.

01:10.420 --> 01:11.614
Can I go play in there?

01:11.620 --> 01:13.497
Heck, yeah. I got it just for you.

01:14.750 --> 01:17.162
Neighbor down the street.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.411
I gave him 10 bucks for it.
Pretty good, huh?

01:19.420 --> 01:20.489
Yeah!

01:20.500 --> 01:21.569
You can go play.

01:21.580 --> 01:24.287
Okay, look, Rodney is gonna
kill me ifI miss this plane.

01:24.290 --> 01:27.327
So, here are some mac and cheese
twofer coupons and some cash.

01:27.330 --> 01:28.570
It's not a whole lot,

01:28.580 --> 01:30.992
but it'll get you through
a couple drive-throughs.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.877
And no sodas.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.029
Milk.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.168
My cell phone's not gonna
work on the cruise, I don't think.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.991
So, if something happens
just call the travel agent?

01:41.290 --> 01:43.747
Oh, God, maybe I should just
cancel this whole trip.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.207
Are you kidding me?
You win an amazing raffle

01:47.210 --> 01:49.417
and you want to cancel it? That's crazy.

01:49.420 --> 01:52.321
Honey, you're going
and you're going right now.

01:52.330 --> 01:54.878
I've just never left her
for a whole week before.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.166
Relax. Get drunk, get laid.

01:57.170 --> 01:58.876
We've got this. Right, Gabby?

01:58.880 --> 02:00.029
Yeah.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.325
Wait, I'm coming out.

02:01.330 --> 02:04.413
-Come_ here.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.820
Give me a hug bye.

02:06.830 --> 02:08.286
I love you, and you listen
to your Aunt Sue.

02:08.290 --> 02:09.917
-Okay?
-Okay, Mama.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.536
-I love you!

02:13.380 --> 02:15.029
Bye, I love you. Have fun.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.371
Can we play in the house now?

02:16.380 --> 02:17.665
Say "Bye, Mommy."

02:17.670 --> 02:19.911
Bye! I love you!

02:19.920 --> 02:21.456
Love you more.

02:21.460 --> 02:22.825
We'll miss you!

02:26.290 --> 02:28.326
Yeah.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.036
-Let's be fairies.
-Okay.

02:31.580 --> 02:34.117
-You got your wings?
-Yeah.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.951
Bing! Ding!

02:35.960 --> 02:37.029
-Ding! -Okay.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.496
You need a jacket, honey.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.876
It's cold.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.916
I'm fine, Daphnie, thank you.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.378
Poor thing. Can't sleep again, huh?

02:54.380 --> 02:56.416
Been away from her mama about a week.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.785
Yeah, she's fine during the day.

02:57.790 --> 02:59.576
It's just at night time
is a bit of trouble.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.617
I'm glad to see
the quiet drives are helping.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.997
Always worked with my babies.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.820
Have a nice sleep, little one.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.532
-Night night.
-Night night.

03:18.830 --> 03:20.991
You buckled up. Yeah. Okay.

04:43.210 --> 04:44.325
Uh, milk, sorry.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.450
Slow down, shorty.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.070
Hey, 6.50 on number two.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.240
There's a line, Willie.

04:59.790 --> 05:01.917
Just turn on the pump, man.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.286
Baby, you need a hand?

05:05.290 --> 05:07.076
'Cause as you can see,
I got very big hands.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.661
I'm fine, thank you.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.911
Sure is one fine little lady, though.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.371
Help! Help! Somebody!

05:26.380 --> 05:27.824
Help! Help!

05:27.830 --> 05:29.707
Someone call 911!

05:29.710 --> 05:32.281
Somebody! The baby's gone!

05:32.290 --> 05:34.827
Help! Call 911! My baby's gone!

05:34.830 --> 05:35.990
Please call!

05:36.000 --> 05:38.912
Please! Call 911!

05:38.920 --> 05:41.070
Oh, my God!

05:41.080 --> 05:43.537
Oh, my God!

05:43.540 --> 05:44.746
Help!

05:49.170 --> 05:50.660
It is now three hours and counting

05:50.670 --> 05:51.876
since four-year-old Gabby Hoffer

05:51.880 --> 05:54.075
was abducted from
her cousin Sue Walsh's car.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.662
Why would anyone leave a little girl
alone in a car at night.

05:56.670 --> 05:59.286
Sue told local authorities that she
was a couple blocks from her house,

05:59.290 --> 06:00.780
she didn't want to wake Gabby up,

06:00.790 --> 06:02.781
she was in and out of that mini mart
In under four minutes.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.610
That's a pretty tight
window of opportunity.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.326
Whoever took her
must have been stalking them.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.321
Is there a history of
child abductions in this area?

06:08.330 --> 06:11.618
No, but the local registry shows
a high concentration of sex offenders.

06:11.620 --> 06:12.951
We have no time to waste.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.576
We do have an eyewitness, but
his recollection's limited to a dark van

06:15.580 --> 06:17.207
that he saw pull up next to Sue's car.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.325
That's pretty vague.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.286
So we don't have a color
or know who was drIVIng.

06:20.290 --> 06:22.326
Are there surveillance cameras
on the premises?

06:24.580 --> 06:25.956
But the footage is being
sent to the lab right now

06:25.960 --> 06:27.200
for enhancement.

06:27.210 --> 06:28.780
SSA Canning is on scene

06:28.790 --> 06:29.996
with the southeast regional card team.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.116
They're conducting neighborhood
and roadblock canvasses.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.031
We all know what to do.
If this is a stranger abduction,

06:34.040 --> 06:36.827
we've got fewer than 24 hours
to bring Gabby back alive.

08:01.170 --> 08:03.821
It's often said
there is no footprint too small

08:03.830 --> 08:06.958
to leave an imprint on this world.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.700
Garcia, where are Gabby's parents?

08:08.710 --> 08:10.280
Away, but not together.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.530
They're divorced.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.703
Mom, Kate, is coming back
from a Caribbean cruise

08:14.710 --> 08:16.109
with her new boyfriend.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.748
And Doug, Gabby's bio dad,

08:18.750 --> 08:21.412
is a long-haul trucker who is on the road.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.035
And this is where bad turns to worse.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.701
Dad has a history of drug problems.

08:24.710 --> 08:25.950
Since Gabby's under five years old

08:25.960 --> 08:27.609
and her father's whereabouts are unknown,

08:27.620 --> 08:30.748
statistics say he's more likely
the offender than a stranger abduction.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.457
He could have been the one who
stalked them and grabbed Gabby.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.325
Morgan, you and JJ head
over to Sue Walsh's house.

08:35.330 --> 08:36.615
See if any of the neighbors have seen

08:36.620 --> 08:39.032
-Gabby's father lurking around.-All right. Got it.

08:41.540 --> 08:44.452
A possible
abduction and an AMBER Alert

08:44.460 --> 08:46.325
-out on Gabby Hoffer.-

08:51.420 --> 08:54.162
Five hours and 23 minutes
since Gabby was taken.

08:54.170 --> 08:56.240
Witness pulled up to pump number two here,

08:56.250 --> 08:57.569
saw the van parked there.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.912
Blocked his view of Sue's car.
Said the brake lights were on.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.819
The driver could have
kept his foot on the brake

09:01.830 --> 09:03.912
whi|_e someone else used
the sliding door to grab her.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.992
It'd be smart to use a partner
out in the open like this.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.241
We have nine registered sex offenders
within three miles.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.456
Sometimes they work in tandem.

09:10.460 --> 09:11.825
We have teams going door to door now.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.070
That's good, cover your bases.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.457
But it's the ones we don't know about
who are the most dangerous.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.666
What's the word on the parents?

09:16.670 --> 09:19.161
Mom and boyfriend Rodney
are confirmed off CONUS.

09:19.170 --> 09:20.376
They'll be at the PD. soon.

09:20.380 --> 09:22.371
We have any location
on the biological father yet?

09:22.380 --> 09:23.608
Still not answering his cell phone.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.451
It's not pinging off any towers, either.

09:25.460 --> 09:28.532
So he shut his cell phone off.
That's odd for a trucker.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.110
Unless it's a countermeasure.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.246
The dark van could have just been

09:31.250 --> 09:32.877
a transport vehicle
to get Gabby to his truck.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.286
You're thinking he waited
for the opportunity to take her?

09:35.290 --> 09:36.996
He has motivation given
that he lost custody.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.877
We should check rest stops
for his truck as well.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.451
The problem is Interstate 59
is just three blocks away,

09:41.460 --> 09:43.576
and it goes to Louisiana,
Alabama and Georgia.

09:43.580 --> 09:44.706
We've got the borders covered.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.075
Nobody's getting out of here
without a fight.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.787
Agent Canning, can you get video
footage for us from a five-mile radius?

09:48.790 --> 09:50.576
We need to see if there's
any video of this dark van

09:50.580 --> 09:52.207
Not much hope there.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.166
Katrina_ took out a lot of
the security and traffic cams.

09:54.170 --> 09:55.535
They haven't been replaced.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.246
Is Sue inside? We need to talk to her.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.535
An agent drove her home
and is staying with her

09:58.540 --> 10:00.826
in case there are any ransom demands.
She's a wreck.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.741
Not sure you'll get anything new.
Excuse me.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.570
All right. Blake, you and Reid
stay with Canning's people.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.662
If Gabby was a victim of opportunity,
then the UnSubs

10:06.670 --> 10:08.319
didn't have a plan
and they could still be in the area.

10:08.330 --> 10:11.208
Dave and I will go to the police station
and interview Kate and the boyfriend.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.745
Is she awake?

10:48.120 --> 10:49.667
Did you find Gabby?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.667
No, not yet.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.537
But we could use your help.
I'm Agent Jareau.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.110
This is Agent Morgan.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.371
Mind if we have a seat?

10:57.380 --> 10:58.950
I'm sorry. Have a seat.

11:07.170 --> 11:10.287
Sue, when we handle these...

11:10.290 --> 11:12.246
When we handle these cases,

11:12.250 --> 11:14.377
we start by eliminating family

11:14.380 --> 11:15.574
and work our way out from there.

11:15.580 --> 11:17.707
So, do you have any brothers or sisters?

11:17.710 --> 11:19.416
No.

11:19.420 --> 11:22.821
Kate's the only family that I got.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.742
She's more like a sister to me
than a cousm.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.162
Her parents took me in after mine died.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.706
I'm so sorry. How old were you?

11:33.290 --> 11:34.826
Eight.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.417
It's all right.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.615
We know this is a tough time.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.668
Did anyone take special interest
in Gabby since you've had her?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.418
No. No.

11:46.420 --> 11:50.117
I always had her right by my side.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.610
Except. . .

11:53.290 --> 11:55.076
I was only gone, like, one second.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.958
I got her to sleep finally
and I didn't want to wake her.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.372
There's nothing you can do
about that now, okay?

12:00.380 --> 12:02.416
You just need to focus on finding her.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.660
So think back.

12:03.670 --> 12:04.955
Was there a deliveryman?

12:04.960 --> 12:06.279
-A service worker?
-No.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.110
-A neighbor?
-No, nobody.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.496
I don't know, maybe everybody.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.209
I mean, she's so nice.
She smiles at everybody.

12:17.210 --> 12:18.370
What about her father?

12:18.380 --> 12:19.665
Have you seen him

12:19.670 --> 12:22.036
No. He's always on the road.
He never calls.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.070
Did he know that
you were watching Gabby?

12:24.080 --> 12:26.036
Okay, Sue.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.780
Do you know anyone with a dark van?

12:31.170 --> 12:32.876
No. No.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.118
I'm sorry. I just can't even believe
this is happening right now.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.951
Well, you're the best at finding kids.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.571
You're gonna find Gabby, right?

12:47.330 --> 12:48.786
God, just tell me something,

12:48.790 --> 12:52.032
'cause right now all I can tell myself
is I never, ever should have left her.

12:52.420 --> 12:53.489
I need your help.

12:54.620 --> 12:55.666
Anything.

12:56.330 --> 12:57.376
Tell me about Gabby.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.247
She's just about the sweetest
little girl you've ever met.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.536
And how long have
you been seeing Kate?

13:03.540 --> 13:05.531
Almost a year.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.167
She's the best person I know.

13:07.170 --> 13:10.321
Nearly eloped on that cruise,
but we wanted Gabby there for it.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.958
Has Gabby ever wandered off with anyone?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.569
No.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.529
A stranger?

13:18.540 --> 13:20.826
No. There's just no way.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.240
I warned her too much about that.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.569
What about with someone she knew?

13:23.580 --> 13:24.877
Like who?

13:26.290 --> 13:28.076
Doug?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.877
He hasn't seen her for almost a year.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.911
Oh, God.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.286
Oh, God, you think that man
took my little girl?

13:36.290 --> 13:38.827
Do you know where Doug is right now?

13:38.830 --> 13:40.240
He's on the road,

13:40.250 --> 13:41.660
somewhere.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.570
Oh, God, he did it, didn't he?

13:44.580 --> 13:48.072
He swore that he would get back at me
for leaving him and he's finally done it.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.207
-We don't know that.
-But that son of a bitch

13:50.210 --> 13:52.075
is your number one suspect, isn't he?

13:52.080 --> 13:53.957
How would you get in touch
with him if it were an emergency.

13:55.670 --> 13:59.242
He has two cell phone numbers.
One is personal

13:59.250 --> 14:01.536
and one is a company road one
for emergencies.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.700
- -Garcia, I need you to track

14:02.710 --> 14:07.659
GPS on this cell phone number,
601-555-0181.

14:20.580 --> 14:23.822
Maybe she might know a thing
or two about what goes on around here?

14:23.830 --> 14:24.876
Mm-hmm.

14:27.830 --> 14:30.287
_ Kind of late to be _
taking the trash out, Isn't It?

14:30.290 --> 14:34.329
They only come once a week
and I don't want the house stinking.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.450
You here to find Gabby?

14:39.460 --> 14:41.030
Yeah. And we could use your help.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.109
When's the last time you saw her?

14:43.120 --> 14:44.701
When Sue took her for a ride.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.246
-A few hours ago?
-Yeah.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.115
I don't sleep so good anymore.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.917
Any little noise wakes me.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.205
Have you seen a dark van?

14:52.170 --> 14:53.819
Not tonight.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.570
But one came through the other day.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.371
Think he's a plumber.

14:58.380 --> 14:59.995
Can you remember the company name?

15:01.170 --> 15:02.785
All right. Thank you.

15:10.540 --> 15:11.609
She's seen a van.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.958
Not yet, but we've got a lead

15:14.960 --> 15:16.746
on a dark van, could belong to a plumber.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.035
Check local businesses.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.497
You've had less.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.240
Come on, baby girl,

15:22.250 --> 15:23.820
we need an ID and location right now.

15:23.830 --> 15:26.458
There are four plumbers
in the immediate area.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.821
White minivans are all the rage.

15:30.830 --> 15:31.990
There's The Little Family Plumber.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.706
They have a bluish van that's dark.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.575
Run employee background checks.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.377
Won't be hard. It's only the owner

15:37.380 --> 15:40.031
and his nephew, Ian Little, 25.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.168
He was released last year
for slinging bennies and heroin.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.286
-Where is he now?
-Sleeping, I imagine.

15:45.290 --> 15:47.531
I'm sending you his home address.
There it is.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.077
Hattiesburg P.D.
got a call about an abandoned truck.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.320
Found the phone under the seat.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.536
Just got confirmation.

16:06.540 --> 16:07.825
Truck belongs to Doug Hoffer,

16:07.830 --> 16:08.956
Gabby's father.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.370
This is only five miles
from the abduction site.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.109
-It was smart to leave it out here.
-The property owners

16:12.120 --> 16:13.576
streamed the video from that camera

16:13.580 --> 16:14.911
to my phone.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.206
We have the truck
being parked here Sunday.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.575
Did he walk back into town?

16:18.580 --> 16:20.571
No. A little tough to see,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.571
but he was definitely
picked up by a dark minivan.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.071
-Tell me you have a license plate.
-Yeah. Just ID'd the owner.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.741
Ian Little.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.911
What is he doing here?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.660
What the hell happened to his face?

16:44.670 --> 16:45.955
You know him.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.916
Yeah. Doug used to buy drugs from him.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.571
Do you think Ian helped him take Gabby?

16:58.040 --> 16:59.166
What's his story?

16:59.170 --> 17:00.614
Claims he hasn't seen Gabby in months

17:00.620 --> 17:03.111
but admits that
he picked up Doug on Sunday.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.917
Well, he's smart to admit it,
since we've got his mug

17:04.920 --> 17:06.490
on surveillance cameras.

17:07.210 --> 17:09.201
Ooh. That's got to hurt.

17:09.210 --> 17:11.451
Those look like second
and third-degree burns.

17:11.460 --> 17:14.611
He hasn't had proper medical attention.
Looks infected.

17:14.620 --> 17:17.532
Says he was trying to light his
gas grill and he left the propane on

17:17.540 --> 17:19.826
while he went back inside to get matches.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.570
He returned, struck the match,

17:21.580 --> 17:22.990
and it blew up in his face.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.285
That doesn't make sense.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.450
Propane dissipates.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.200
It would take serious flames
to curl around

17:27.210 --> 17:28.495
and burn behind his ears.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.957
Who gets those kind of burns
but doesn't go to the hospital?

17:30.960 --> 17:33.576
Someone who has something to hide.

17:34.710 --> 17:36.109
There are no calls,

17:36.120 --> 17:39.032
but Ian's cell pinged
off of three cell phone towers

17:39.040 --> 17:41.281
outside of town on Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday.

17:41.290 --> 17:42.575
I sent you the locations.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.377
Cell tower range and directionality

17:46.620 --> 17:49.828
electromagnetic
and traffic capacity variations.

17:50.880 --> 17:51.995
-Meaning?
-A cell phone can travel

17:52.000 --> 17:53.991
to the same location,
but ping off of different towers

17:54.000 --> 17:56.036
on different days due to
independent outside variables.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.702
Garcia, can you see
what's at this intersection point?

17:58.710 --> 18:00.450
39-30 latitude,

18:00.460 --> 18:03.111
negative 89-42 longitude.

18:03.670 --> 18:04.910
That would be

18:04.920 --> 18:08.663
the old Little farm.
And that's Little, not like diminutive,

18:08.670 --> 18:10.206
but Little family.
That's where Ian grew up.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.781
So Doug went missing three nights ago,
and Ian's been at that farm each night

18:13.790 --> 18:15.951
-since then.-Holy crappy childhood.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.916
You can't make this kind of sadness up.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.377
It's also the place where Ian's dad
killed his mother

18:20.380 --> 18:22.325
with a shotgun and then
turned it on himself.

18:27.790 --> 18:30.577
I'm Agent Hotchner.
I don't have any time to waste.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.741
So, I'm going to give you
once chance to answer my questions.

18:33.330 --> 18:36.072
I know the story about
how you got these burns is a lie.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.742
These are the kinds of burns we see
when people add gasoline to a fire,

18:38.750 --> 18:40.160
like when they're trying
to get rid of a body.

18:40.170 --> 18:42.035
Is that what you did? Yes or no.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.496
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.246
I also know exactly

18:46.250 --> 18:48.377
where you spent the last three nights.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.371
You picked up Doug on Sunday
and you let him hide here,

18:50.380 --> 18:51.495
didn't you?

18:51.500 --> 18:53.991
He waited there for a few days,
you drove him into town in your van

18:54.000 --> 18:56.377
to try to abduct his daughter,
and something went wrong

18:56.380 --> 18:58.871
and Doug hurt Gabby
and you were left with a dead little girl.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.201
And you thought you knew
how to get rid of her.

19:01.210 --> 19:02.780
I want a lawyer.

19:02.790 --> 19:04.576
That's all right.

19:04.580 --> 19:05.820
I have my answers.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.372
I have a team searching
the farm right now,

19:09.380 --> 19:10.745
and they will ﬁnd the body.

19:56.710 --> 19:57.870
Who the hell is that?

19:59.670 --> 20:01.456
It's our main suspect.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.325
Searched the entire property.

20:14.330 --> 20:15.911
We found Ian's van in the barn.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.206
No sign of Gabby anywhere.
What have you got?

20:18.210 --> 20:19.370
Coroner says Doug died

20:19.380 --> 20:20.495
from blunt force trauma to the head.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.162
Then it looks like Ian tried to burn
Doug's body here,

20:23.170 --> 20:25.115
which, of course, was harder than
he thought it would be,

20:25.120 --> 20:27.076
so then he dumped
Doug's body in the water.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.038
Sounds like rage followed by just about
every disposal method that we know of.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.031
Even wrapped the body,
weighed it down with rocks.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.166
Could it be remorse?

20:33.170 --> 20:34.410
It's more like concealment.

20:34.420 --> 20:36.206
We see it a lot when there's
a connection between the vic

20:36.210 --> 20:37.666
-and the killer.
-Coroner says Doug's been dead

20:37.670 --> 20:38.910
for at least 72 hours.

20:39.170 --> 20:41.240
That would be the same day he got here.

20:41.250 --> 20:44.037
So what did this guy do
to get himself killed?

20:46.540 --> 20:48.997
Let me make sure I understand, Agent.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.877
You said that Gabby was never there.

20:51.290 --> 20:52.826
That's right, she wasn't.

20:52.830 --> 20:53.990
But Ian killed Doug.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.456
He must have something to do

20:55.460 --> 20:57.325
-with taking her.
-Let me talk to Ian.

20:57.330 --> 20:59.491
I'm sorry, we can't let you do that.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.161
No, but he will talk to me.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.951
Well, oh, God,
when Doug and I first got together,

21:06.960 --> 21:08.325
we smoked a little weed

21:08.330 --> 21:10.457
with Ian and then
I got pregnant with Gabby

21:10.460 --> 21:13.782
and I realized that I needed
to quit all that stuff.

21:13.790 --> 21:16.532
You know, I wanted to be a good mom.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.326
I'm just saying that
Ian and I go way back,

21:19.330 --> 21:22.322
and he will tell me stuff
that he may not tell you guys.

21:22.330 --> 21:23.820
Because, honestly,

21:23.830 --> 21:26.993
him hurting Gabbyjust...
It doesn't make any sense to me.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.115
I'm sorry,

21:28.120 --> 21:30.076
but Ian isn't speaking to anyone,

21:30.080 --> 21:31.160
except maybe a lawyer.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.035
I'm so sorry.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.571
Card team found this on the interstate.

22:13.460 --> 22:14.700
It looks like Gabby's

22:14.710 --> 22:16.496
blanket to me. Ask your client.

22:18.330 --> 22:19.706
I have no idea.

22:19.710 --> 22:22.076
I advise you not to waste my time.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.115
Where is Gabby?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.377
Where is she?

22:28.380 --> 22:30.701
I don't know. I swear.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.577
I'm sorry. I just ran in for a second.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.320
I would never leave her like that.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.241
Okay, I understand this is difficult,

22:46.250 --> 22:49.822
but what I need you both to do right now
is focus on finding Gabby.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.957
Getting her back in your arms.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.370
Can you do that?

22:54.710 --> 22:57.110
Okay.

22:59.380 --> 23:01.280
Excuse me.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.167
The mini mart video's back from the lab.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.707
I've looked through the whole thing.
Sue's story holds up.

23:06.620 --> 23:09.953
03 pm.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.167
Cashier was the only one inside
until then.

23:12.710 --> 23:14.575
Hold on. Let me rewind.

23:18.670 --> 23:20.661
Right there. Is that Sue's shirt?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.206
Hmm.

23:23.210 --> 23:26.282
She didn't mention walking to the door
and then turning around.

23:26.290 --> 23:28.372
How long before she actually goes in?

23:32.210 --> 23:33.529
Two minutes later.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.872
Maybe she was worried about
leaving Gabby alone in the car.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.747
Well, there were plenty of places to park
right in front of the store.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.163
She chose the side. No windows, no lights.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.991
She told us she didn't want the lights
or the noise to wake Gabby up.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.742
Right, but as a woman,
especially one with a small child,

23:47.750 --> 23:49.957
safety comes first.
It's instinctual to find

23:49.960 --> 23:52.167
a quick well-lit journey
from your parked car

23:52.170 --> 23:53.990
-to the door.
-It could have been a trial run.

23:54.540 --> 23:56.496
We see that in inexperienced criminals

23:56.500 --> 23:58.161
who need to build up their nerve.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.410
Wait a minute.

23:59.420 --> 24:00.660
-You thinking she did all of this?

24:01.210 --> 24:03.417
-Go.-See if there's any recent contact

24:03.420 --> 24:05.285
between Ian Little and Sue Walsh.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.376
Scanning slimeball's cell now.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.109
Not a lot of repeat numbers.
Trick of the trade,

24:09.120 --> 24:11.577
disposable cells.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.786
Okay.

24:12.790 --> 24:16.419
Oh, there are dozens of calls
to and from this number, though.

24:16.420 --> 24:19.742
And I'm gonna cross-check it
with Sue Walsh's home.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.320
We have a match. Yeah.
They talked. They talked.

24:33.420 --> 24:35.490
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

24:37.290 --> 24:39.201
Sue, we need a formal statement.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.958
-Would you mind coming with me.
-Of course not.

24:50.790 --> 24:55.159
Did you ever have any hesitation
leaving Gabby with Sue?

24:55.170 --> 24:56.319
Well, why would I?

24:56.880 --> 24:58.871
Like a mother's intuition thing.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.492
Did you ever feel like
there was anything wrong?

25:03.880 --> 25:06.326
Sue didn't have a problem with it,

25:06.330 --> 25:07.740
and Gabby's spent the night there before.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.911
We're trying to put

25:09.920 --> 25:11.456
some missing pieces together.

25:11.460 --> 25:12.825
Okay.

25:12.830 --> 25:15.071
Do you know Ian Little?

25:17.540 --> 25:19.326
Kind of.

25:19.330 --> 25:22.413
He comes into the diner
a few times a week.

25:22.420 --> 25:25.378
We've got phone records that show
you talk to Ian...

25:27.000 --> 25:28.536
A lot.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.878
Please don't tell Kate.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.529
I mean, she never would have
let Gabby come over

25:33.540 --> 25:35.417
if she knew that Ian was coming around.

25:35.420 --> 25:38.321
Why is a smart girl like you
hanging out with this guy?

25:38.330 --> 25:40.116
He's better now. He's cleaned up.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.411
And he's different with me.

25:42.830 --> 25:44.707
I'm really good for him.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.910
You lost your parents

25:47.920 --> 25:49.376
when you were young.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.075
Mm-hmm.

25:53.710 --> 25:55.666
What does that have to do with anything?

25:55.670 --> 25:57.956
Well, maybe he gives you the attention

25:57.960 --> 25:59.370
that you need.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.371
Yeah, I guess so.

26:03.420 --> 26:04.990
You say Ian's clean?

26:05.710 --> 26:07.371
Is he still dealing?

26:08.040 --> 26:09.371
No...

26:09.380 --> 26:10.665
I don't think so.

26:10.670 --> 26:11.785
Then why would Ian

26:11.790 --> 26:13.371
kill Gabby's father?

26:15.960 --> 26:17.700
I don't know.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.538
Maybe it was an old grudge

26:25.540 --> 26:27.496
or a bad deal or something.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.535
Uh-huh.

26:30.880 --> 26:31.949
Okay.

26:33.170 --> 26:35.377
Now...

26:35.380 --> 26:36.745
We need your full statement.

26:37.210 --> 26:38.416
Okay.

26:39.210 --> 26:41.030
Are you sure you'll be able to write

26:41.040 --> 26:42.871
with that hand?

26:42.880 --> 26:44.199
Oh. Yeah.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.160
Gabby broke a glass.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.667
Kids.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.780
What exactly am I supposed to write?

26:57.790 --> 26:59.109
Just tell us what happened.

26:59.460 --> 27:00.825
Okay.

27:03.290 --> 27:06.202
We know that Ian picked up Doug
on Sunday, then he was killed.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.319
What if they surprised Sue

27:08.330 --> 27:09.570
-at the house?
-And Doug

27:09.580 --> 27:11.571
-was threatening to take Gabby.
-They could have been trying

27:11.580 --> 27:13.741
to protect Gabby from him
and he was killed by accident.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.706
Except they went to extravagant lengths
to cover it up.

27:15.710 --> 27:16.870
Okay, that may be true,

27:16.880 --> 27:18.245
but it still doesn't answer where Gabby is

27:18.250 --> 27:20.206
or what anyone's motivation is
in hurting her.

27:20.210 --> 27:21.450
We can keep theorizing,

27:21.460 --> 27:23.496
but every minute we do
is a minute Gabby's out there.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.279
Dave.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.702
We want the truth from your client.

27:32.710 --> 27:34.109
What are you offering?

27:34.120 --> 27:35.667
That depends on whether
he fully cooperates.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.786
My client
did not kill Doug Hoffer.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.371
He only disposed of the body.

27:39.380 --> 27:40.574
Prove it

27:40.580 --> 27:42.957
and the AUSA has agreed to pled him
from murder to accessory

27:42.960 --> 27:45.201
He knows who did it.

27:45.210 --> 27:47.826
That's hearsay, it's not proof.

27:47.830 --> 27:50.207
She cut her hand when she hit him
with that candleholder.

27:52.620 --> 27:54.497
They were arguing by the front door.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.877
She's my daughter,
and I am going to see her.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.075
Doug went in to go get
Gabby out of bed.

27:59.080 --> 28:02.117
Sue picks up this candleholder
and hit him really hard in the head.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.200
It sounded really bad.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.878
It was heavy glass and it broke
when she hit him again.

28:13.460 --> 28:14.745
Her blood was all over.

28:16.170 --> 28:17.205
Guys, over here.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.286
So was Doug's.

28:26.290 --> 28:28.326
She hid it in a shoebox in the closet.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.205
Why would she keep the murder weapon?

28:40.120 --> 28:42.247
She thinks she's too smart to get caught.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.706
Are you all right?

28:49.120 --> 28:50.371
Did you find Gabby?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.319
What do you think?

28:54.210 --> 28:55.666
Are we gonna find her?

29:01.750 --> 29:02.876
Kate trusted you

29:02.880 --> 29:04.950
with the care of her child.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.246
You were responsible for this little girl.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.575
You had a duty to protect her,

29:10.580 --> 29:12.116
and you failed,

29:12.120 --> 29:13.530
miserably.

29:14.580 --> 29:17.162
What happened to Gabby is all your fault.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.166
You know nothing

29:19.170 --> 29:20.455
about what it takes to be a mother.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.280
-You're pathetic.

29:22.290 --> 29:24.531
You son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

29:25.250 --> 29:26.410
Get off me!

29:26.420 --> 29:28.786
Get off me! No!

29:28.790 --> 29:31.702
No! Get off me!

29:35.960 --> 29:38.201
Talk about taking one for the team.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.495
What was that all about?

29:39.500 --> 29:42.071
If she's a predisposed female offender,

29:42.080 --> 29:44.992
a major indicator is uncontrolled rage
when challenged.

29:45.710 --> 29:47.166
I'd say she passed the test.

29:47.170 --> 29:50.571
She has no criminal record,
no history of violence.

29:50.580 --> 29:53.708
-They're very good at concealment.
-They're also the rarest type.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.780
They go after young children
in their care,

29:55.790 --> 30:00.454
and their offenses can be sadistic,
brutal and sometimes bizarre.

30:00.460 --> 30:02.416
The blunt force trauma that killed Doug

30:02.420 --> 30:04.490
says that she has serious violence issues.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.456
Something must have triggered that rage.

30:06.460 --> 30:09.247
Whatever it was,
I'm afraid of what that means for Gabby.

30:09.250 --> 30:12.492
I know Sue is not gonna talk to us,
but maybe she would talk to Kate.

30:14.540 --> 30:17.168
She did that to you
and you want Kate going in there?

30:17.170 --> 30:19.411
Rodney, I've got to go talk to her.

30:19.420 --> 30:20.990
She's restrained. I will be at the door.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.706
There's nothing she can do
physically to hurt her.

30:37.960 --> 30:40.326
What is wrong with you?

30:45.250 --> 30:47.161
You still don't get it, do you?

30:49.290 --> 30:50.917
I trusted you.

30:51.290 --> 30:53.167
And I trusted you.

30:54.670 --> 30:56.285
What are you talking about?

30:56.290 --> 30:58.918
When I moved into
your perfect little house,

30:58.920 --> 31:00.740
your perfect little street,

31:00.750 --> 31:03.457
everybody told me that I lucked out,

31:03.460 --> 31:04.996
that I got myself a good family.

31:05.710 --> 31:08.167
Well, I had a good family.
I didn't want yours.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.411
What happened to your family wasn't fair,

31:10.420 --> 31:12.320
but why would you take that out on Gabby?

31:15.580 --> 31:18.708
At first I thought that it wasn't only me
that he touched.

31:20.830 --> 31:22.536
What are you talking about?

31:22.540 --> 31:24.701
Where is Gabby?

31:27.540 --> 31:28.609
Gabby's gone.

31:30.460 --> 31:32.826
-Now you know how I used to feel.
-What?

31:34.380 --> 31:36.029
Like there's no air left.

31:36.040 --> 31:37.826
Where?

31:37.830 --> 31:40.879
For a really long time,
I thought that's just how things worked

31:40.880 --> 31:42.495
in your family.

31:43.330 --> 31:45.412
'Cause your dad liked me
to sit on his lap,

31:46.670 --> 31:48.410
till it got more than that.

31:48.420 --> 31:51.821
I used to stay up late at night
to see if he opened your door, too.

31:51.830 --> 31:53.661
But he didn't.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.240
Just mine.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.992
He always did say that
I was his special little girl.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.456
That's not true.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.530
My dad never touched you.

32:02.540 --> 32:05.111
He used to put me on the floor
'cause it was quieter.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.200
When he was done,

32:06.210 --> 32:08.576
I'd put the lightbug on
and I'd go under the bed.

32:08.580 --> 32:11.287
That's where I sleep, but not you.

32:11.290 --> 32:14.202
-You got all the_good memories.

32:15.710 --> 32:17.109
You're insane.

32:17.830 --> 32:20.742
Maybe I am.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.321
What does that make you?

32:23.330 --> 32:25.286
You left your kid for five days.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.115
All I know is that

32:28.880 --> 32:31.952
I will never let mine out of my sight.

32:39.960 --> 32:43.168
She'll be here in the summertime.

32:47.580 --> 32:49.286
-Oh, my God.
-She mixed her past

32:49.290 --> 32:51.872
and present tenses,
which shows unconscious deception.

32:56.880 --> 33:00.168
Have a seat.
-Oh, God, she never mentioned Gabby.

33:00.620 --> 33:02.918
And she said my dad...

33:02.920 --> 33:04.911
Oh, God.
RODNEY: Don't let her get to you.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.785
Your dad's a good man.

33:06.790 --> 33:08.951
We all know she's lying.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.247
She's never going to tell us
where Gabby is.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.662
You got her to reveal more than you know.

33:14.670 --> 33:16.160
Kate's right.

33:16.170 --> 33:18.240
Sue's never gonna tell us where Gabby is.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.036
It's her final move to punish Kate.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.247
She wants to inflict
maXImum pain upon Kate.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.376
So you're thinking she'll do

33:23.380 --> 33:26.281
whatever it takes to make_
Kate suffer and keep on suffering.

33:26.290 --> 33:27.700
Not knowing what happened to your child

33:27.710 --> 33:28.995
would be the ultimate
torture for any parent.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.536
But if Sue killed Gabby,

33:30.540 --> 33:33.031
chances are eventually,
we'd find the body.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.998
She'd need to find a way
to get rid of her permanently,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.740
without killing her.

33:41.540 --> 33:42.746
Nothing's out of place.

33:42.750 --> 33:44.706
In fact, all of Gabby's things
are packed up

33:44.710 --> 33:46.450
as if she was preparing to go back home.

33:46.460 --> 33:48.416
That's strong evidence
of a false allegation.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.570
So all of this was arranged
by Sue for what,

33:50.580 --> 33:51.740
to get back at Kate?

33:51.750 --> 33:54.287
You should have seen her with Kate.
She was relentlessly sadistic.

33:54.290 --> 33:56.372
So Sue planned this with whoever
was in the dark van.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.245
But there doesn't seem
to be any paper trail of It here.

33:58.250 --> 34:01.037
And there's not electronic trail either.
There's no computer or cell phone.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.996
Outside of a land line,
this girl's living tech-free.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.285
That's because she's hiding something.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.990
Yeah. All right, Reid.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.740
-Thanks.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.206
I'm going to call Garcia.

34:10.210 --> 34:11.996
Mama, is it even possible

34:12.000 --> 34:14.207
for somebody to live
completely offline these days?

34:14.210 --> 34:17.828
Sure, if you live in an Afghani cave
or certain parts of New Jersey.

34:17.830 --> 34:19.070
Other than that, not so much.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.490
We can't even find an Internet connection

34:20.500 --> 34:22.411
or any communication device in Sue's home.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.376
What, so, she's like old school

34:24.380 --> 34:25.745
-Cash transactions?-Yeah,

34:25.750 --> 34:28.617
but somehow she had to connect
with whoever actually grabbed Gabby.

34:29.790 --> 34:32.748
A girl like that's got to
go online somewhere.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.706
Well, she doesn't have much money.
She'd have to do it cheap.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.168
Well... Okay, I started
my illustrious career

34:38.170 --> 34:39.910
on the web at the library,

34:39.920 --> 34:41.706
because the computers
and the Internet are free.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.166
She could have done that

34:43.170 --> 34:45.115
using pseudonyms and anonymizers.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.701
I know all of this,
but I'm gonna need some help

34:46.710 --> 34:47.779
if I want to narrow it down quickly.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.240
Okay, call Blake.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.036
Maybe she got something out of
Sue's written statement.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.167
Good. Yes, and thank you.
I'm on the trail.

34:54.330 --> 34:56.378
Lady, I need your word wisdom

34:56.380 --> 34:58.109
to help me track Sue's online activity.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.872
Well, the only thing that stuck out

34:59.880 --> 35:02.110
was her use of lightbug
instead of light bulb.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.452
I heard her say it to Kate
and noticed it in her statement, too.

35:04.460 --> 35:05.575
Lightbug.

35:05.580 --> 35:06.911
Got it.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.615
"I'll switch the lightbug off in the car

35:08.620 --> 35:09.746
"so no one will see."

35:10.250 --> 35:11.535
Where did you find that?

35:11.540 --> 35:12.950
Backtracking now...

35:17.040 --> 35:19.998
Oh, no. It's an online forum

35:20.000 --> 35:22.070
discussing a troubled four-year-old girl.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.162
Any identifying information
on who she's talking to?

35:24.170 --> 35:25.910
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.114
No.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.202
-Oh, no. This is gonna be a dead end.
-What happened?

35:30.210 --> 35:32.075
Libraries that don't want Feds

35:32.080 --> 35:34.958
tracking what their patrons
are reading or surfing on the web,

35:34.960 --> 35:36.370
they erase

35:36.380 --> 35:38.780
their servers at the end of the night.

35:38.790 --> 35:39.916
Can you recover the files?

35:41.380 --> 35:44.952
If it were done,
t'were well it were done quickly.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.951
Okay, it's still early.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.282
Maybe they haven't
written over the files yet.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.911
Yes! Okay, I've got
an IP address fragment and...

36:00.000 --> 36:02.787
Gabby's not the only baby on that forum
that's being discussed.

36:03.290 --> 36:04.450
Garcia, I need to know

36:04.460 --> 36:06.826
everything that you can find
about anyone communicating with Sue.

36:06.830 --> 36:09.162
Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna...

36:09.170 --> 36:10.706
Oh, my God. Oh, no, no, no.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.411
Sue gave Gabby away.

36:17.830 --> 36:19.036
Who has her, Garcia?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.246
I don't know. I don't...

36:20.830 --> 36:23.537
Okay. I don't know, but I'm gonna send you

36:23.540 --> 36:24.780
this online investigative report
right now.

36:24.790 --> 36:28.533
Read this, and I'm gonna find out who.
I'm gonna find out who.

36:32.380 --> 36:33.699
Disrupted adoptions?

36:33.710 --> 36:35.371
That's what the people
involved are calling it.

36:35.380 --> 36:37.610
They're also referring to it as re-homing.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.780
And it's been happening underground

36:38.790 --> 36:39.950
-for some_ time now.
-Unt|| now,

36:39.960 --> 36:42.451
it's mainly been ovenNhelmed
adoptive parents

36:42.460 --> 36:44.109
of problem children from overseas.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.417
Good people go on the site

36:45.420 --> 36:47.456
looking for guidance or services,
but bad people offer to take

36:47.460 --> 36:49.451
problem kids off their hands
as a last resort.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.530
So they just give them away
to some random couple?

36:51.540 --> 36:53.326
Calling them couples is a bit generous.

36:53.330 --> 36:56.208
The article talks about these people
who pose as families,

36:56.210 --> 36:58.371
but really they're just freaks
looking for access to kids.

36:58.380 --> 37:00.245
And no one's keeping track of them.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.660
Why isn't this illegal?

37:01.670 --> 37:03.160
Well, 'cause
it's a relatively new practice,

37:03.170 --> 37:05.491
and unsurprisingly,
no legislation's been written yet.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.115
So how did Sue manage to give Gabby away?

37:07.120 --> 37:08.246
She posed as Gabby's mother

37:08.250 --> 37:09.990
and gave her to a woman who claimed

37:10.000 --> 37:12.286
she knew how to deal with troubled kids.

37:27.460 --> 37:28.609
I want my mommy.

37:28.620 --> 37:30.030
Hush, Carly.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.826
My name is Gabby.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.492
If you cry, bad things will happen.

37:57.170 --> 37:58.910
Garcia, we're out of time.
We need something.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.287
Okay. There are three
families who responded to Sue's posts.

38:02.290 --> 38:03.826
Do any of them own a dark van?

38:06.710 --> 38:10.453
There's a Nicole Jones.
She owns a blue '03 Caravan.

38:10.460 --> 38:13.702
She lives in a shack
20 miles south of where you are

38:13.710 --> 38:15.246
-off of Interstate 59.-Let's go.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.325
Clear!

39:11.380 --> 39:12.449
Guys!

39:17.380 --> 39:18.665
Don't shoot me.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.416
Where's Gabby Hoffer?

39:21.880 --> 39:22.949
She's gone.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.666
She's still not talking.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.570
She must have panicked
and got rid of Gabby.

39:30.580 --> 39:32.821
Garcia, who else from the area
answered Sue's post.

39:32.830 --> 39:35.572
Uh. There's one woman, Michelle Fader.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.616
She ran in the same sick circles.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.876
And she owns an old van.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.416
Miss Fader's a real winner.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.910
She was evicted from
her last-known address.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.036
They probably won't risk going back
towards the abduction site,

39:45.040 --> 39:46.166
which means they're headed southwest.

39:46.170 --> 39:47.205
Let's go.

39:49.620 --> 39:53.408
Okay. The woman I hope
you're about to arrest had

39:53.420 --> 39:55.069
all of her biological kids taken from her

39:55.080 --> 39:58.413
five years ago because another child
died while in her custody.

39:58.420 --> 40:00.536
She was never charged?-Oh, no, she was,

40:00.540 --> 40:02.110
but for neglect.
She didn't spend a minute in jail.

40:02.120 --> 40:04.497
Social workers haven't
come by her house at all

40:04.500 --> 40:06.036
because none of her kids
are In her custody.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.497
And they have no idea
she's been finding new children online.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.377
These poor little darlings
are being treated like trash.

40:10.380 --> 40:13.110
They don't know that anybody cares.
We care. We care.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.782
Garcia, widen your search
to any known male associates

40:15.790 --> 40:17.417
-of Michelle Fader.-Yeah, will do.

40:22.460 --> 40:25.202
Oh, I got a picture of Fader with some guy

40:25.210 --> 40:26.996
who could win sleaze of the century award.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.787
He's got his arm all possessively
around a sweet little girl.

40:29.790 --> 40:31.951
Run facial recognition sobeare
and get an ID on him.

40:34.290 --> 40:36.747
Okay, I got a match.
Michael Feehan.

40:36.750 --> 40:38.456
He is the perv in the picture with Fader.

40:38.460 --> 40:41.247
He's not in any registries,
but he has got a list

40:41.250 --> 40:42.956
of accusations. None of them were proven

40:42.960 --> 40:44.416
because all of the victims were too young.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.285
-Garcia, did you get the address?-Running it now.

40:53.880 --> 40:54.949
Please, give me a reason.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.957
Michelle Fader,

40:59.960 --> 41:01.666
you're under arrest for staging
a child abduction.

41:01.670 --> 41:03.535
I didn't do nothing.
Look, I was trying to help that girl.

41:03.540 --> 41:04.916
_ You have_ the
right to remaIn Silent.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.911
I am only trying
to help that girl.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.535
She wanted a fresh start.
-Anything you say

41:08.540 --> 41:09.996
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.490
She couldn't take care
of her own babies anymore.

41:11.500 --> 41:12.706
You have a right to an attorney...

41:12.710 --> 41:14.917
-I am trying to help that girl!
-You have a right to an attorney.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.114
What's gonna
happen to my babies?

41:16.120 --> 41:18.827
I've got Gabby.
And there are other kids back here.

41:19.540 --> 41:20.916
Are you okay?

41:21.710 --> 41:23.530
Can you take me home now?

41:25.620 --> 41:27.076
Yes, sweetheart.

41:29.170 --> 41:30.706
Okay, come on.

41:30.710 --> 41:32.371
Up you go.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.569
Mama!

41:47.250 --> 41:48.740
My sweet baby!

41:50.290 --> 41:51.826
I missed you, Mama.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.576
I missed you so much.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.377
Why are you sad?

41:57.380 --> 41:59.530
I'm not sad.

41:59.540 --> 42:01.826
So those are happy tears?

42:01.830 --> 42:02.990
Yep.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.372
We're never, ever gonna leave you.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.287
JJ, you okay?

42:18.710 --> 42:21.247
They don't have any place safe to be.

42:22.170 --> 42:26.413
It's not ideal, but they'll be in
foster care until they find a family.

42:26.420 --> 42:29.742
Yeah, but how many more kids
like that are out there?

42:29.750 --> 42:31.741
That's a good question.

42:34.120 --> 42:35.200
- -Hey, sweetness,

42:35.960 --> 42:37.279
thought you might want to see something.

42:37.290 --> 42:38.325
What?

42:40.380 --> 42:43.201
We're gonna go home now and you can...

42:43.210 --> 42:44.325
Have a good meal.

42:44.670 --> 42:45.739
Oh, ho-ho.

42:47.250 --> 42:48.786
I needed that.

42:54.120 --> 42:57.453
"A mother's arms
are made of tenderness,

42:57.460 --> 43:00.418
"and children sleep soundly in them."

43:00.420 --> 43:01.910
Victor Hugo.
