WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:03.993
Man: The exhibit was
a paradox of absurdity,

00:04.000 --> 00:05.559
Impressionistic
and surreal.

00:05.570 --> 00:09.438
The choice of sunlight to create
such darkness was stunning.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.239
Oh, it's exciting to
have such a talent

00:12.240 --> 00:14.777
Emerge from
the |.A. Art scene.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.475
I was moved
by the boldness.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.879
Man: It was
absolutely sublime.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.975
Woman: We'll raise lots
of money on this, andrea.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.516
Well done. Ha ha ha!

00:22.520 --> 00:24.215
Man: A toast to our
enchanting hostess

00:24.220 --> 00:27.315
And committee chair
andrea brown.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.583
You've outdone
yourself, my dear.

00:28.590 --> 00:30.558
Thank you, walt,
but I couldn't do it

00:30.560 --> 00:32.722
Without my illustrious
board members,

00:32.729 --> 00:35.028
And tonight is
about my gratitude

00:35.030 --> 00:38.261
For your tireless
fundraising efforts.

00:38.270 --> 00:38.930
Thank you.

00:38.930 --> 00:40.523
Cheers.
Cheers. Well done.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.429
Congratulations.
Thank you.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.034
Yeah.
Mm. Mm.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.259
Did you pay
your bills, andrea?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.908
[laughter]

00:49.910 --> 00:53.073
Robyn, can you check
the fuse box, sweetie?

00:53.080 --> 00:54.343
Think we have
a short.

00:54.350 --> 00:55.749
Of course.

00:55.750 --> 01:00.039
Oh, well, maybe not.
Ha ha ha! Never mind.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.212
Mood lighting.
Sorry about that.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.959
Mm.
Ok.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.383
[dog barking]

01:07.400 --> 01:09.255
And that
would be roxy.

01:09.270 --> 01:13.969
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
This is embarrassing.

01:13.970 --> 01:16.029
Make sure
she's ok.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.462
Excuse me.

01:17.470 --> 01:20.064
[barking continues]

01:20.080 --> 01:23.004
Roxy? Come here, girl.
What is it?

01:23.010 --> 01:24.000
[barking]

01:24.010 --> 01:26.399
What's the matter,
sweetie?

01:28.720 --> 01:29.846
[feedback]

01:29.850 --> 01:34.310
[music playing]

01:40.060 --> 01:41.994
What is that?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.425
It's roberta flack.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.728
Oht

01:51.110 --> 01:56.901
It's him.
He was in my house.

02:25.610 --> 02:29.069
All right.

02:29.810 --> 02:32.074
Hey, you got
your homework?

02:32.080 --> 02:33.104
Ethan: Yes.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.077
Books?
Yes.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.345
Oh, I forgot
my lunch.

02:38.350 --> 02:42.719
Get in the car.
I'll get it.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.028
Ethan: Hey.
It's you again.

02:52.030 --> 02:54.897
Just morning run.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.039
You live around here?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.769
Yeah.

02:58.770 --> 03:03.332
I'm ethan.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.504
Wesley.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.649
Nice to meet you,
wesley.

03:07.650 --> 03:09.539
Those boys
from Halloween

03:09.550 --> 03:10.847
Still giving you
trouble?

03:10.850 --> 03:13.615
Nah. You pretty much
fixed them.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.749
Good.
Headed to school?

03:16.760 --> 03:19.058
Yeah.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.324
Where's your mom?

03:21.330 --> 03:22.752
She had court
this morning,

03:22.770 --> 03:25.899
So her boyfriend
trent is taking me.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.994
You don't like him?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.638
He's ok, I guess.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.462
Trent: Ethan, let's go.

03:32.470 --> 03:36.236
Ok. Coming.
I got to...Go.

03:40.950 --> 03:43.271
You don't talk
to strangers.

03:43.290 --> 03:47.818
- He's not.
He lives around here.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.569
Morning.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.732
Morning.
Nice house.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.560
Very. Belongs
to andrea brown.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.435
She filed a report
with us two weeks ago.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.270
We obtained
a restraining order

04:11.280 --> 04:12.645
And against her ex-husband,
and he was being

04:12.650 --> 04:14.140
A good boy
until last night.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.414
I read the police report--
breaking and entering,

04:16.420 --> 04:19.617
Vandalism.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.855
Jack: Is this what
you call I.A. Art?

04:23.860 --> 04:25.680
Mm. You're funny.

04:25.690 --> 04:26.919
Andrea brown
runs the board

04:26.930 --> 04:28.659
For the doheny museum
art project.

04:28.660 --> 04:31.129
It's a fancy nonprofit
that raises money

04:31.130 --> 04:33.895
For various charities
by auctioning off

04:33.900 --> 04:37.268
The work of new
and important artists.

04:37.270 --> 04:38.760
Is that
a real job?

04:38.770 --> 04:39.601
Philanthropy.

04:39.610 --> 04:40.839
Andrea is
independently wealthy

04:40.840 --> 04:42.433
Due to a fat
divorce settlement.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.930
So an angry ex
is behind this.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.409
Yes--kenneth brown.
He's a real estate developer.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.218
He made a fortune
in the nineties,

04:49.220 --> 04:50.472
Happy couple until--

04:50.490 --> 04:51.810
He cheated on her,
and she took him

04:51.820 --> 04:52.742
For everything
he had.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.512
She got it all,
including the dog.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.249
All he got was
a bad real estate market,

04:56.260 --> 04:58.729
Debt, and the fake blond
with the fake tan

04:58.730 --> 04:59.879
And the fake boobies.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.129
Seriously,
that sounds like

05:01.130 --> 05:03.349
Some horrible
|.A. Cliche.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.622
We love cliches.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.769
We live them,
make movies about them.

05:06.770 --> 05:08.295
It's the |.A.
Way of life.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.189
You'll get
the hang of it.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.905
You called them
boobies?

05:11.910 --> 05:17.132
It's daytime, jack.
I try to keep it g-rated.

05:18.850 --> 05:21.273
Andrea: I knew kenneth
was an angry bastard,

05:21.280 --> 05:23.510
But this was
one step too far.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.510
Can you relay
the events

05:24.520 --> 05:26.113
That led to
the restraining order?

05:26.120 --> 05:29.181
Ask detective lawrence.
She knows all of this.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.260
She's handling my case.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.819
I understand,
but sometimes new details

05:31.830 --> 05:34.822
Can surface
from our memory.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.925
It started with
harassing phone calls,

05:37.930 --> 05:39.523
And then he accosted me

05:39.540 --> 05:41.099
In a restaurant
one night.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.364
He wanted to borrow
money, and I said no,

05:43.370 --> 05:44.804
And he tried
to strangle me.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.539
They had to
pry him off me.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.134
Is that when
you called tau?

05:49.140 --> 05:52.974
Tell me about
your marriage.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.369
Kenneth and I were
married for 15 years.

05:55.380 --> 05:58.441
It was a good marriage,
wasn't perfect,

05:58.450 --> 06:01.784
But it worked
for a long time.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.189
We loved each other.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.522
Why'd you
get divorced?

06:05.530 --> 06:07.589
People grow apart.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.752
His eyes started to
wander to younger women.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.819
He cheated, and once
the trust is gone,

06:13.840 --> 06:15.069
So is the marriage.

06:15.070 --> 06:18.563
I understand kenneth
is very unhappy.

06:18.570 --> 06:21.437
I got what we agreed to
in the prenup,

06:21.440 --> 06:23.579
And now he wants
to ruin me

06:23.580 --> 06:26.402
With my work,
my friends.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.149
He's making
a mockery of me.

06:28.150 --> 06:30.278
Jack: Mrs. Brown,
what's the significance

06:30.290 --> 06:32.816
Of the song
that was playing?

06:32.820 --> 06:35.755
It was the song we danced
to on our first date.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.080
It's been our song
ever since.

06:37.090 --> 06:39.388
Do you think that there's
a part of your ex-husband

06:39.400 --> 06:40.356
That still loves you?

06:40.360 --> 06:42.590
- No. Our love
is dead, detective.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.160
He hates me now,
and that's just fine.

06:45.170 --> 06:48.265
Just want him
to leave me alone.

06:48.270 --> 06:49.362
We'll talk to him.

06:49.370 --> 06:51.930
I filed the report and
got a restraining order.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.635
Can't you just
arrest him?

06:53.640 --> 06:55.039
Beth: We know this
is scary for you.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.429
No. Actually,
I'm frustrated,

06:57.450 --> 07:00.499
And, yes, I'm scared
because I know kenneth,

07:00.520 --> 07:04.070
And he has a temper,
and he resents me.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.843
He's not gonna stop.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.488
Robyn: I've worked for andrea
for several months now.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.696
Do you know
her ex-husband?

07:15.700 --> 07:16.553
Not very well,

07:16.570 --> 07:19.267
But I do know
he has a temper.

07:19.270 --> 07:21.898
And how is your
relationship with andrea?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.369
Very good.
I respect her.

07:24.370 --> 07:26.737
She's a very
strong woman,

07:26.740 --> 07:28.606
And when you're
a strong woman,

07:28.610 --> 07:30.203
People call you
callous,

07:30.210 --> 07:31.541
Heartless bitch,
but I saw

07:31.550 --> 07:33.439
What the divorce
did to her.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.077
It broke her heart.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.174
Thank you for speaking
with me, robyn.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.680
Yeah. No problem.

07:38.690 --> 07:39.839
Jack: Looks like you
control the lights

07:39.860 --> 07:41.453
By the panel located
in the garage,

07:41.460 --> 07:42.950
No prints, but
the security system

07:42.960 --> 07:44.280
Has 4 digital cameras.

07:44.290 --> 07:45.360
I'm getting
the drive.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.919
Get that footage to ben.
He's fast with it.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.921
See if you can get
kenneth's face on camera.

07:48.930 --> 07:53.492
Janice, come with me.
You know the ex already.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.697
Kenneth: Well,
I didn't do it.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.337
I was home all night.

07:58.340 --> 07:59.830
He was home
all night.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.739
You were with him?

08:00.740 --> 08:04.108
No. I had my pilates
class last night.

08:04.110 --> 08:05.999
Then how do you
know he was home?

08:06.010 --> 08:08.513
Because
he said so.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.874
Kenneth: I'm not lying.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.881
The woman filed
a restraining order against me.

08:11.890 --> 08:14.143
I'm not going within
10 miles of that bitch.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.559
Yeah.
She's crazy.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.289
You attacked her
in a restaurant.

08:17.290 --> 08:20.157
Kenneth: I was angry.
She took all my money.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.458
I have a mortgage
that I can't pay.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.393
Yes. I lost
my temper.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.459
Beth: Like you're
doing right now?

08:25.470 --> 08:26.995
Maybe you need
to calm down.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.630
It's ok, honey.
She's testing you.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.301
She's trying
to make you mad.

08:32.309 --> 08:34.107
I know
this tactic.

08:34.110 --> 08:35.032
How so?

08:35.039 --> 08:37.475
You're doing it
to me now.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.972
Listen. We have done
nothing but suffer

08:40.980 --> 08:44.041
At the hands of this
crazy woman.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.347
She took
everything.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.717
What did she take
of yours, melissa?

08:47.720 --> 08:49.381
One could argue
that you are

08:49.390 --> 08:51.688
The one who did
the taking.

08:51.690 --> 08:53.283
Do we need
to call a lawyer?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.688
Do you need
to call a lawyer?

08:54.700 --> 08:55.656
Stop doing that.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.889
Melissa, sweetie,
it's ok.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.698
No. It's not.
I'm tired of her.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.122
Why doesn't she just
leave us alone?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.835
She is the one
that's harassing us.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.232
Listen. Andrea went off
the deep end after the divorce.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.572
You sure it wasn't
after your affair?

09:08.580 --> 09:10.275
I know that what I did
doesn't make me sound

09:10.280 --> 09:11.748
Like the most
upstanding guy,

09:11.750 --> 09:13.775
But I am not
stalking andrea,

09:13.780 --> 09:15.748
And I certainly didn't
break into her house.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.639
I have better things
to do with my time,

09:17.650 --> 09:20.119
Like digging myself
out of this gutter hole

09:20.120 --> 09:21.758
That she put me in.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.512
He's telling
the truth.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.282
Do you know of anyone
else in her life

09:25.290 --> 09:26.780
Who might
want to hurt her?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.495
Anyone who
knows the bitch.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.128
I'm telling you,
andrea is a mean woman.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.894
Look. I know that I hurt her,
but she was

09:32.900 --> 09:35.995
Just as cruel and
vindictive in the divorce.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.094
She ruined me.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.704
And roberta flack?

09:40.710 --> 09:44.908
Huh? Who's that?

09:44.910 --> 09:48.471
She's a singer.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.244
I've never
heard of her.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.014
"First time ever
I saw your face"

09:52.020 --> 09:54.614
Is the song
in question.

09:54.620 --> 09:59.023
She told you
about that song.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.225
What song?

10:00.230 --> 10:03.291
It was mine and andrea's
song as a couple.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.668
Well, what's our song?
We don't have a song.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.968
All right.
We'll get a song.

10:08.970 --> 10:13.009
Look. I'm not
stalking my ex-wife, ok?

10:13.010 --> 10:16.503
I want her gone
from my life.

10:16.510 --> 10:19.150
You understand?

10:19.150 --> 10:20.675
Ben: I've got a man
wearing a ski mask.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.148
He clearly knew
where the cameras were.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.845
You see how he's walking
backwards in certain areas?

10:23.850 --> 10:25.887
Janice: The man's build
could easily be kenneth.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.585
It's not enough.
We need a face.

10:27.590 --> 10:29.217
What do we know about
the divorce settlement?

10:29.220 --> 10:31.257
Well, kenneth and andrea
married in '98.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.058
He accrued a net worth
of $27 million

10:33.060 --> 10:35.051
In the first decade
of their marriage.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.256
Beth: California
is a no-fault state.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.466
How did andrea
end up with so much?

10:39.470 --> 10:42.337
If kenneth cheated, andrea
got 90% of everything.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.739
According to court
transcripts,

10:43.740 --> 10:45.265
Kenneth's lawyers
argued that andrea

10:45.270 --> 10:46.567
Was psychologically
unbalanced,

10:46.580 --> 10:48.400
That her deranged behavior
was as much of a cause

10:48.410 --> 10:50.401
For the failed marriage
as kenneth's infidelity.

10:50.410 --> 10:52.504
There was no proof of it,
and a judge sympathized

10:52.510 --> 10:56.219
And awarded her 95% of
their net worth for defamation.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.449
California
is tough.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.509
Beth: Seems like
revenge stalking.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.147
Serves a
psychological need,

11:01.160 --> 11:02.082
A way of holding on

11:02.090 --> 11:03.251
To the person
being stalked.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.557
Janice: So kenneth
is trying to maintain

11:04.560 --> 11:06.028
A connection with andrea,
even while he goes about

11:06.030 --> 11:07.520
Destroying everything
in her life

11:07.530 --> 11:09.020
That she took
away from him?

11:09.030 --> 11:10.100
Why would he do that?

11:10.100 --> 11:13.161
It could explain the
song, a nostalgic ploy.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.160
It's so cliched.

11:14.170 --> 11:17.037
I told you.
We love our cliches here.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.599
They even come
with a soundtrack.

11:18.610 --> 11:19.634
But roberta flack?

11:19.640 --> 11:21.039
What are you
talking about?

11:21.040 --> 11:22.576
Your life has
a soundtrack, ben.

11:22.580 --> 11:23.809
No, it doesn't.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.904
What were you listening to
on the way to work?

11:25.910 --> 11:27.400
"The carpenters'
greatest hits."

11:27.420 --> 11:29.013
You should keep that
to yourself.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.079
Ben: And
you're so cool?

11:31.090 --> 11:31.909
Pearl jam.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.740
"White-winged dove,"
stevie nicks.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.183
Everyone
IS so retro.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.625
And you?
What?

11:38.630 --> 11:40.985
Song?
Let's focus on kenneth.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.525
Traffic cams,
parking tickets.

11:42.530 --> 11:44.123
Let's see if he
was in the vicinity

11:44.130 --> 11:45.996
Of andrea's house
violating

11:46.000 --> 11:47.525
That restraining
order,

11:47.540 --> 11:52.660
And, jack, it's
a pat benatar day.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.430
Andrea: They'll have to
walk through the exhibit

11:57.450 --> 11:58.702
To get to the bar
to get drunk,

11:58.710 --> 12:02.214
Which is what they're
coming for, anyway...

12:02.220 --> 12:03.517
Perfect.

12:03.520 --> 12:07.684
And I want flowers
on all the tables.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.485
What's that?

12:10.490 --> 12:11.480
Oh, it's for you.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.458
It was delivered
before I got here.

12:13.460 --> 12:16.896
Were you expecting
a package?

12:16.900 --> 12:19.562
Read the card.

12:19.570 --> 12:22.392
Mm...

12:22.400 --> 12:23.834
"do not be greedy.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.762
"Because
of these sins,

12:24.770 --> 12:29.731
The wrath of god
is coming upon you."

12:31.150 --> 12:33.448
No!

12:33.450 --> 12:36.545
Oh, my god, no.

12:36.550 --> 12:40.942
Please. No, no, no.

12:46.790 --> 12:50.954
I don't understand how
anyone could do this.

12:50.970 --> 12:54.395
It's so cruel.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.765
You said that you
and kenneth

12:55.770 --> 12:57.795
Got the dog when
you were married?

12:57.810 --> 13:00.199
Yes, 10 years ago.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.770
He loved roxy
as much as I did.

13:02.780 --> 13:04.771
I mean, even
after the divorce,

13:04.780 --> 13:09.149
Kenneth used to keep
her on the weekends,

13:09.150 --> 13:12.017
I mean, at least
until melissa moved in.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.215
Then what happened?

13:13.220 --> 13:16.588
Oh, she didn't
like the dog.

13:16.590 --> 13:19.252
She wouldn't let
roxy come over anymore.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.457
Janice: The message sent
to andrea is from the bible--

13:22.460 --> 13:24.895
Colossians chapter 3,
verses 5 and 6.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.664
"Do not be greedy,
for a greedy person

13:26.670 --> 13:28.695
"is an idolater worshipping
the things of the world.

13:28.700 --> 13:32.659
Because of these sins, the wrath
of god is coming upon you."

13:32.670 --> 13:34.764
Ben: And we looked
into melissa barnes.

13:34.780 --> 13:35.975
Her father
was a pastor.

13:35.980 --> 13:38.130
She would have personal
knowledge of the bible.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.700
And we found this.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.814
Beth: Oh, melissa.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.141
Let's see if she'll
come in for questioning.

13:46.150 --> 13:48.118
Amanda: Beth, excuse me
for interrupting,

13:48.120 --> 13:51.613
But I need to speak
with detective larsen.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.453
[clears throat]

14:03.600 --> 14:07.036
You came to my house.
Trent saw you.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.439
Amanda, relax.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.407
You spoke to ethan.

14:09.410 --> 14:10.935
Did you think he
wasn't gonna tell me?

14:10.950 --> 14:13.339
Wesley? You used
your father's name?

14:13.350 --> 14:15.148
You're getting
very sloppy, jack.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.278
I told you to stay
away from my son.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.985
He doesn't know
who I am.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.139
And he never will,

14:20.160 --> 14:21.685
Not as long
as I am breathing.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.488
You may be his
biological parent, jack,

14:23.490 --> 14:25.356
But you will never be
a father to ethan.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.852
You have no idea what it
takes to be a father.

14:27.860 --> 14:31.353
You know it,
and I know it.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.793
You're done, jack.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.132
I'm gonna tell beth
everything.

14:36.140 --> 14:37.494
That'll
hurt you, too.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.659
I am not the one
who slept

14:38.670 --> 14:39.967
With a key witness
in the roberts trial.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.108
You knew what happened
and didn't say anything.

14:42.110 --> 14:43.373
You are complicit.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.348
Actually, that's
not really true.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.547
It wasn't my case,
and I didn't

14:48.550 --> 14:50.541
Suspect anything
until she came and

14:50.550 --> 14:52.848
She rang my doorbell
looking for you.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.046
That creep deserved
to go to prison.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.949
You know it.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.158
That is so
not the point.

15:02.060 --> 15:06.099
I warned you, jack.

15:18.010 --> 15:19.774
Melissa, thank you
for coming in.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.475
Did I have a choice?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.848
Please have a seat.

15:27.150 --> 15:29.380
Look. I already
told you everything.

15:29.390 --> 15:30.789
Just cut
to the chase.

15:30.790 --> 15:31.985
You clearly
have an agenda.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.651
Well, we found
a 5150 on your record.

15:33.660 --> 15:37.096
3 years ago, you broke into
your ex-boyfriend's home,

15:37.100 --> 15:38.556
And when he woke up,
you were

15:38.570 --> 15:39.765
Standing over him
holding a knife.

15:39.770 --> 15:41.761
I was wondering when
that was gonna pop up.

15:41.770 --> 15:42.896
It was
a long time ago.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.460
You were on a psychiatric hold
for 72 hours.

15:45.470 --> 15:47.962
Look. I was in a bad
place back then.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.199
I made some
stupid choices.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.336
Why does it matter?

15:51.350 --> 15:53.546
Someone killed
andrea's dog.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.848
What?

15:55.850 --> 15:59.150
Can you tell us
where you were last night?

15:59.150 --> 16:01.949
I was at home
with kenneth.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.759
Are you accusing me
of killing that dog?

16:04.760 --> 16:06.819
It was, like,
15 years old.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.924
It probably died,
and andrea

16:08.930 --> 16:11.297
Is pretending like
somebody killed it.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.597
I mean, she's crazy.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.819
Andrea also
received a message,

16:14.840 --> 16:15.898
A bible verse.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.493
Your father is
a pastor, right?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.808
Are you accusing me
of something?

16:19.810 --> 16:21.437
We're just trying
to find the truth.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.908
I didn't
do anything.

16:22.910 --> 16:25.345
You people, you need
to leave me alone.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.944
I will get a lawyer.
I know my rights.

16:27.950 --> 16:30.510
Just leave me alone.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.942
[beep beep]

17:04.180 --> 17:06.147
Oh! Ah!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.289
Uh!

17:08.290 --> 17:12.124
Uh!

17:12.130 --> 17:14.758
Oh, no. No. No.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.627
Get off me.
Help me!

17:17.630 --> 17:19.189
[whimpering]

17:19.200 --> 17:22.067
Man: Hey, you,
get off her!

17:22.069 --> 17:23.799
Get off me.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.461
[crying]

17:28.610 --> 17:31.875
Are you ok?
Hey, miss.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.770
[tires screeching]

17:40.750 --> 17:42.889
Look at me.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.710
I need to get
out of here.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.357
You suffered
a head contusion.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.180
The doctor said
I'd be fine.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.023
I have my gallery
fundraiser this afternoon.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.589
Hey, slow down.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.261
I don't want
to slow down.

17:55.270 --> 17:58.831
I don't deserve this.
I want to kill him.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.638
You need to let
us handle it.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.937
Then handle it.

18:01.940 --> 18:04.671
Put him behind bars.
Just stop him.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.500
We need evidence
to do that,

18:06.510 --> 18:08.239
And we don't
have it yet.

18:08.250 --> 18:11.470
He killed my dog.
He attacked me.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.709
Isn't that
enough evidence?

18:13.720 --> 18:16.417
There's nothing to link him
to those two incidences,

18:16.420 --> 18:18.889
But if there is
evidence to be found,

18:18.890 --> 18:21.655
We will find it, andrea.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.637
Hey, jack,
got a minute?

18:32.640 --> 18:34.699
No. Sorry.
I don't.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.439
I know about
you and amanda.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.078
What are you
talking about?

18:38.080 --> 18:39.150
What are you doing?

18:39.150 --> 18:41.403
You sneaking around?
You talking to her son?

18:41.420 --> 18:42.819
You're fishing.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.811
Amanda didn't
tell you anything.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.140
Hey--

18:46.150 --> 18:47.345
Get your hands
off me.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.680
It doesn't
take a genius

18:48.690 --> 18:50.010
To figure
this out, jack.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.613
You and amanda,
you were a thing

18:51.630 --> 18:52.552
In new york, right?

18:52.560 --> 18:54.324
You're the guy that
screwed her over.

18:54.330 --> 18:57.527
I'm not gonna engage
with you, trent. I'm not.

18:57.530 --> 18:58.725
Just stay away
from amanda

18:58.730 --> 19:00.095
And stay
away from her son.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.898
You understand me?
Or what?

19:01.900 --> 19:03.265
Don't push me.

19:03.270 --> 19:06.501
You'll know when I do.
Trust me.

19:06.510 --> 19:10.799
Are you
ethan's father?

19:16.420 --> 19:19.185
I just--
I need to know

19:19.190 --> 19:24.811
What I'm getting
myself into here.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.824
I care about her.

19:28.830 --> 19:32.960
Don't worry
about me, trent.

19:32.970 --> 19:37.339
I'm not a problem
for you.

19:44.310 --> 19:46.176
Ben: This is
the surveillance video

19:46.180 --> 19:48.808
Taken from andrea's house
during the first attack.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.914
Here, we see the guy
in the ski mask.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.548
He walks along the wall,
and there,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.346
Something on
his left wrist.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.714
Looks like a
bracelet or a watch.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.052
Yep, but there's
no clear view until

19:59.060 --> 20:01.154
I got the video from
the parking garage.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.857
See, the car's plates
are smartly covered up,

20:03.870 --> 20:07.022
But, see,
there's the watch.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.089
Crop and zoom.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.229
It's a 1978
rolex daytona 6263.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.334
That's a $35,000
watch.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.603
How do you
know that?

20:16.610 --> 20:18.169
I dated this rich kid
in high school.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.670
He actually got one
for graduation.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.341
Why didn't you
marry him?

20:21.350 --> 20:24.615
Ben: And it's listed right here
in the divorce settlement.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.317
Kenneth brown got possession
of a daytona watch.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.517
I'll call beth.

20:35.730 --> 20:37.289
[melissa crying]

20:37.300 --> 20:39.894
Door's open.

20:43.070 --> 20:44.731
[knock knock]

20:44.740 --> 20:46.959
Melissa?

20:46.980 --> 20:50.075
[melissa sobbing]

20:50.080 --> 20:51.707
It's lieutenant davis.

20:51.710 --> 20:56.250
[sobbing continues]

20:56.250 --> 20:58.048
Where's kenneth?

20:58.050 --> 21:02.715
I don't know.
He left.

21:03.660 --> 21:06.083
Melissa, what happened?

21:06.090 --> 21:08.252
Someone e-mailed me
this video.

21:08.260 --> 21:10.251
The video was sent
from an anonymous e-mail,

21:10.270 --> 21:12.523
But I know that
andrea sent it.

21:12.530 --> 21:15.022
How could I have
been so stupid?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.737
He kept telling me that
his ex-wife was crazy,

21:17.740 --> 21:21.699
That she was just
trying to scare us.

21:21.710 --> 21:24.771
This whole time,
he was sleeping with her.

21:24.780 --> 21:28.375
Melissa, do you
recognize this?

21:28.380 --> 21:31.714
It's kenneth's watch.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.848
Andrea was attacked
last night,

21:33.860 --> 21:36.852
And the man who attacked her
was wearing that watch.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.510
We need to talk to kenneth.

21:38.530 --> 21:41.659
If there is something
you're not telling us,

21:41.660 --> 21:44.891
Now is a good time.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.678
Where'd you get this?

22:03.690 --> 22:05.510
Melissa: I found it
in kenneth's trunk

22:05.520 --> 22:08.444
<i>The day after andrea's
dog was killed.</i>

22:09.360 --> 22:11.055
You were
protecting him?

22:11.060 --> 22:14.121
I didn't know what to do.
I thought I loved him.

22:14.130 --> 22:18.158
I'm scared that he might
do something stupid,

22:18.170 --> 22:19.797
He was so angry.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.462
He said that he
was gonna hurt andrea.

22:22.470 --> 22:23.869
Put an apb out on
kenneth. Call jack.

22:23.870 --> 22:27.170
Tell him to meet me
at the museum.

22:37.880 --> 22:42.215
John, I just wanted
to say thank you.

22:43.990 --> 22:48.450
Andrea: Hi. Excuse me.
I need to check on the caterer.

23:24.630 --> 23:27.270
Yeah. So lovely
meeting you.

23:27.270 --> 23:28.396
Robyn...
Yeah?

23:28.400 --> 23:33.031
I think she went to
the kitchen upstairs.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.008
Upstairs.

23:43.180 --> 23:46.184
[door closes]

23:49.660 --> 23:52.459
Robyn?

23:55.360 --> 23:56.691
Kenneth.

23:56.700 --> 23:57.690
I need to talk
to you.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.397
No. You stay away from me.
You can't be here.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.526
I just want
to talk, andrea.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.998
I have a restraining order.
Don't you get near me.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.739
Have you lost
your mind?

24:05.740 --> 24:07.162
I'm calling
the police.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.659
Why would you
send that video?

24:08.680 --> 24:10.739
Why'd you have to drag
melissa into this?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.605
You stay away
from me. Oh!

24:12.610 --> 24:14.942
Oht

24:19.990 --> 24:21.389
Beth: Stay down.

24:21.390 --> 24:23.882
[handcuffs click]

24:23.890 --> 24:25.858
You ok?

24:25.860 --> 24:28.557
Mm-hmm.

24:35.070 --> 24:37.164
Andrea: I don't know what I ever
loved about that man.

24:37.170 --> 24:39.138
Jack: You sent the
video to melissa.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.904
Why would you
do that?

24:40.910 --> 24:42.332
You knew it
would provoke him.

24:42.340 --> 24:44.729
He killed my dog.
He attacked me.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.048
I wanted melissa to see
what kind of man

24:47.050 --> 24:48.302
She was marrying.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.049
And why didn't
you tell us that

24:50.050 --> 24:51.916
You were sleeping
with kenneth?

24:51.920 --> 24:53.388
I don't get it.

24:53.390 --> 24:54.619
Because I'm not.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.679
It only happened once
two months ago.

24:56.690 --> 24:59.489
He came over to the house
to get a few of his things.

24:59.490 --> 25:00.889
We got talking.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.289
One thing led
to another, and--

25:03.300 --> 25:05.758
Man: Mrs. Brown,
we're ready for you.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.723
[camera shutter clicks]

25:38.900 --> 25:40.629
Kenneth: She seduced me.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.938
She got me to sleep
with her and filmed it.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.533
She planned
the whole thing.

25:44.540 --> 25:46.702
She is trying
to ruin my life.

25:46.710 --> 25:47.734
Beth: So you go
to the museum,

25:47.740 --> 25:48.866
Choke her out,
and try to kill her?

25:48.880 --> 25:50.177
No. I was trying
to talk to her,

25:50.180 --> 25:53.002
Your way of reasoning
is against the law, kenneth.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.148
I lost my temper,
all right?

25:54.150 --> 25:57.518
You don't get it.
She's driving me crazy.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.319
Is that why
you killed her dog?

26:00.320 --> 26:04.382
What are you--
roxy's dead?

26:04.390 --> 26:06.256
Explain this.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.649
That was found at your home.
That's canine blood.

26:08.660 --> 26:11.197
Agh, that's not
my shirt.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.420
Hang on.
There's a monogram--kb.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.534
I don't even know
where that came from.

26:16.540 --> 26:20.431
Melissa. She found it
in the trunk of your car,

26:20.440 --> 26:22.670
Turned it in to us,
and maybe you should've

26:22.680 --> 26:24.739
Taken off your rolex
when you attacked andrea

26:24.750 --> 26:26.570
Last night in
the parking garage.

26:26.580 --> 26:28.901
We have you on
surveillance, kenneth.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.046
[scoffs]

26:30.050 --> 26:34.044
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.642
I was with clients
last night.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.287
I had a last-minute
walk-through

26:37.290 --> 26:38.689
At one of
my properties.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.055
They can vouch for me.

26:40.060 --> 26:43.826
Great. Give me
their names.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.267
We'll have someone
check it out.

26:47.270 --> 26:49.989
Look. Tonight
I snapped,

26:50.000 --> 26:55.006
But that other stuff,
no, that wasn't me.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.078
<i>I just spoke
to all 3 witnesses.</i>

27:01.080 --> 27:02.479
They confirmed
kenneth brown was

27:02.480 --> 27:04.175
With them the night
of the garage attack.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.581
Ben: I did some research
on the paintings you texted me.

27:07.590 --> 27:09.046
The artist goes
by the name of ink,

27:09.060 --> 27:10.380
- But his real name
is damon edmonds.

27:10.390 --> 27:11.812
He's an up-and-coming
I.LA. Graffiti artist.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.150
Jack: With the exact
same painting style

27:13.160 --> 27:14.958
Of the messages left on
the walls of andrea's house.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.429
Beth: This guy has got a prior
for domestic assault.

27:17.430 --> 27:18.955
And our stalker likes
to hit women.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.267
Ben: And get this--
his very first show

27:20.270 --> 27:22.329
Was at the same museum that
andrea serves on the board.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.900
He also has his own website
which offers

27:24.910 --> 27:26.765
Very expensive
massage services.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.761
Jack: These photos don't
appear to be promoting

27:28.780 --> 27:30.771
His knowledge
of massage therapy.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.929
Can you say,
"boy toy?"

27:31.950 --> 27:33.600
But if she's paying him,
why would he hurt her?

27:33.610 --> 27:36.250
Janice: Maybe he wanted more
than she's willing to give.

27:36.250 --> 27:39.880
We've got probable.
Pick him up.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.852
How do you know
andrea brown?

27:42.860 --> 27:44.259
She's a friend.

27:44.260 --> 27:45.455
What kind of friend?

27:45.460 --> 27:47.827
I'm an artist.
She supports the arts.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.355
She must really
support the arts

27:49.360 --> 27:51.727
For you to afford
a watch like that.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.027
You sleeping
with her?

27:53.030 --> 27:54.168
Is that any
of your business?

27:54.170 --> 27:55.797
Well, she's a wealthy
older woman.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.859
She funds your work.
She put on your first show.

27:57.870 --> 28:01.170
Maybe when the money
and the favors dried up,

28:01.180 --> 28:02.261
You decided
to make her pay.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.873
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.177
Really? Because I have
a video of you

28:05.180 --> 28:08.047
Assaulting her
in a parking garage.

28:08.050 --> 28:09.245
No, you don't.

28:09.250 --> 28:12.242
Yeah. You wore that watch
when you did it.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.740
She must have given
it to you before things

28:13.750 --> 28:15.844
Went south
between the two of you.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.420
You know it's not
a real daytona, right?

28:18.430 --> 28:22.719
Damon, you think she
gave you a $35,000 watch

28:22.730 --> 28:25.290
For a little tail?

28:25.300 --> 28:29.089
You look pretty stupid,
but no one's that dumb.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.363
You did it.

28:30.370 --> 28:32.065
You attacked andrea.

28:32.070 --> 28:34.459
Now tell me why.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.841
It doesn't add up.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.444
Kenneth had an alibi
for the attack in the garage.

28:44.450 --> 28:47.579
Even andrea admitted
he loved the dog.

28:54.830 --> 28:57.822
Wait, wait, wait.
Fast forward.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.566
Look at this.

29:01.570 --> 29:04.892
He left his shirt
at andrea's house.

29:06.570 --> 29:07.833
Are you ready for this?

29:07.840 --> 29:10.309
Andrea paid damon
to attack her.

29:10.310 --> 29:11.778
She gave him a replica
of kenneth's watch

29:11.780 --> 29:13.805
So that when he did
it would lead us

29:13.810 --> 29:16.040
She had kenneth's
shirt the entire time.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.973
She put it in his trunk
to frame him.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.288
Andrea was stalking
kenneth.

29:20.290 --> 29:22.679
False victimization.

29:22.690 --> 29:24.749
She staged the attacks
to incriminate

29:24.760 --> 29:25.784
Kenneth and melissa.

29:25.790 --> 29:27.485
False victimization
stalkers often suffer

29:27.500 --> 29:30.094
From a borderline
personality disorder.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.455
They fluctuate between
emotional stability

29:32.470 --> 29:34.359
And intense anger.

29:34.370 --> 29:35.724
This woman is
totally psychotic.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.595
She constructs all these
elaborate scenarios

29:37.610 --> 29:39.965
To perpetuate violence
against herself,

29:39.970 --> 29:42.905
She even killed
her own dog.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.936
[knock on door]

29:47.380 --> 29:48.199
Melissa.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.473
I just came to tell
you that things

29:50.480 --> 29:52.278
Are over
with me and kenneth.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.645
I want you to know
when I first met kenneth

29:54.660 --> 29:58.619
I didn't know that
he was married,

29:58.630 --> 30:03.750
And, andrea, I never
meant to hurt you.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.797
I'm sorry.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.461
I've been waiting
such a long time

30:07.470 --> 30:10.189
To hear you
say that.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.261
Come in, please.

30:13.540 --> 30:17.033
Maybe now we can
both start to heal.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.735
Hyah!

30:39.530 --> 30:43.034
Finally, you're awake.

30:44.670 --> 30:48.038
This isn't gonna work
if you're passed out.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.407
Andrea, please.

30:50.410 --> 30:53.710
Please let me go, ok?

30:53.710 --> 30:54.506
I'm sorry.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.410
"Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me go.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.649
I'm sorry!"

30:58.650 --> 31:01.085
An apology doesn't
mean anything!

31:01.090 --> 31:04.355
You took him
from me!

31:04.360 --> 31:05.919
When kenneth first
started out,

31:05.930 --> 31:06.829
I was there for him.

31:06.830 --> 31:09.026
I made him everything
that he was,

31:09.030 --> 31:10.259
And I can do that
again,

31:10.260 --> 31:11.819
He's gonna get out
of jail one day,

31:11.830 --> 31:13.127
And I'm gonna be
here for him,

31:13.130 --> 31:17.135
And you aren't gonna be
around to get in our way.

31:17.140 --> 31:20.906
Andrea, I left him.
Look. I promise.

31:20.910 --> 31:23.777
Please. Please just
let me go.

31:23.780 --> 31:26.101
Let you go?

31:27.150 --> 31:30.916
What, after you snuck
into my home,

31:30.920 --> 31:34.447
Hid here, waiting
to kill me?

31:34.460 --> 31:37.213
You are a very sick
young lady,

31:37.220 --> 31:38.881
And everyone knows that
you're the one

31:38.890 --> 31:40.380
With psychiatric
problems.

31:40.390 --> 31:44.793
You attacked me just like
you did your ex-boyfriend,

31:44.800 --> 31:45.949
And I had to
defend myself.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.166
I had no choice
but to kill you.

31:48.170 --> 31:53.040
I mean, after all, you and
kenneth have been stalking me.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.930
No--no one's gonna
believe that.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.010
Yes, they will.

31:57.010 --> 32:00.708
I have been working
on this plan for a long time.

32:00.710 --> 32:04.112
I have had nothing
to do but plan this,

32:04.120 --> 32:07.511
And it's going
surprisingly well.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.442
But...

32:08.460 --> 32:09.985
Ha ha ha!

32:09.990 --> 32:12.186
Melissa...

32:12.190 --> 32:13.726
There's nothing worse

32:13.730 --> 32:16.028
Than a divorced woman
with too much time

32:16.030 --> 32:19.295
And money
on her hands.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.723
Please. Andrea,
you can't--

32:21.740 --> 32:23.060
You can't do this.

32:23.070 --> 32:25.994
Please. I killed
my own dog.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.409
I can Kill you,

32:27.410 --> 32:29.879
And I actually--

32:29.880 --> 32:32.679
I liked roxy.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.479
You attacked me.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.518
Don't you remember
that, melissa?

32:38.520 --> 32:40.511
With this.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.428
And we fought!

32:49.830 --> 32:52.492
Aah! Aah!

32:59.970 --> 33:02.769
It's melissa's car.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.044
Let's go around back.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.254
[whimpering]

33:17.260 --> 33:19.615
I'm gonna untie
you now,

33:19.630 --> 33:22.190
And then you're
gonna stand up

33:22.200 --> 33:23.292
And walk towards me.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.758
Please. Please
don't do this.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.091
It'll all be over
in @ moment.

33:28.100 --> 33:31.035

[muffled whimper]

34:04.840 --> 34:08.264
[muffled whimpering]

34:23.760 --> 34:24.909
Put the gun down.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.126
You got
what you wanted.

34:27.130 --> 34:30.690
Kenneth's in jail.

34:30.699 --> 34:32.520
I'll kill her.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.089
You don't want
to do that.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.989
Yes, I do.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.935
Doesn't anyone care
about what he did to me?

34:38.940 --> 34:40.135
I know. He cheated.

34:40.139 --> 34:43.678
He's a man.
That's what men do.

34:43.679 --> 34:45.569
Is that what you do?

34:45.580 --> 34:48.880
Have you cheated?

34:48.880 --> 34:51.610
Yes.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.940
Why?

34:56.719 --> 34:59.087
Yes. Why, jack?

35:03.430 --> 35:05.728
Why do men do that?

35:06.930 --> 35:09.024
Because I'm weak.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.759
I make
bad decisions.

35:11.770 --> 35:15.866
I ruin everything
worthwhile.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.632
I'm broken,

35:17.640 --> 35:19.039
And I can't
be fixed.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.007
No. Everyone can
be fixed.

35:21.010 --> 35:25.618
Kenneth is gonna be
fixed once she's gone.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.281
[gunshot]

35:27.290 --> 35:29.110
Aah!

35:52.880 --> 35:55.474
[sobbing]

[music playing]

36:06.860 --> 36:08.988
Janice: Beth.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.622
Do you have a moment?

36:11.630 --> 36:13.325
Not if it involves
words like

36:13.330 --> 36:15.799
"I'm sorry,
why didn't I see it?"

36:15.800 --> 36:17.199
Or any other such
blame game lingo

36:17.200 --> 36:21.569
About how you didn't know
andrea brown was behind all this.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.240
I guess I don't
need a moment.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.675
Janice, go home,
open some wine,

36:29.680 --> 36:32.775
Listen to stevie nicks.

36:32.790 --> 36:35.043
We had a great day.

36:36.820 --> 36:42.054
Thank you, beth.
Good night.

36:42.060 --> 36:43.949
Good night.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.910
It's pearl jam.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.173
Nothing against
the carpenters,

36:58.180 --> 37:01.639
But it might be time to
step into a new decade.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.516
Cool.

37:12.460 --> 37:15.350
Jack: You work
long hours.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.459
I like what I do.

37:18.470 --> 37:23.237
Do you even have
a personal life?

37:23.240 --> 37:26.938
What do you want,
jack?

37:26.940 --> 37:29.329
I have a problem.

37:29.340 --> 37:33.004
It involves deputy d.A.
Amanda taylor.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.727
What about her?

37:48.730 --> 37:53.930
We had a relationship
back in new york.

37:53.930 --> 37:58.663
She got pregnant,
had a kid.

37:58.670 --> 38:00.809
I denied it was mine
for years.

38:00.810 --> 38:04.201
Back then, I wasn't
much of a father.

38:04.210 --> 38:08.943
I wasn't around,
I was-- I was horrible.

38:08.950 --> 38:11.214
Amanda and I had
a complicated relationship--

38:11.220 --> 38:13.712
Up and down, in and
out of each other's lives,

38:13.720 --> 38:18.783
<i>And she transferred
to .A. To get away from me,</i>

38:18.790 --> 38:23.023
But here I am.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.658
Is that it?

38:25.670 --> 38:30.767
No. I made other mistakes
while I was in new york,

38:30.770 --> 38:33.740
Things in my past
that could still hurt me,

38:33.740 --> 38:37.904
Jeopardize my career.

38:37.910 --> 38:39.708
Fix it.

38:41.710 --> 38:44.680
I don't know if it
can be fixed.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.682
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

38:47.690 --> 38:51.354
Well, the truth seems
to be working for you.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.010
Today anyway.

38:53.030 --> 38:57.854
Fix it, jack.
I'd hate to lose you.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.998
You're good.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.368
[music playing]

39:29.560 --> 39:30.630
Here we go again.

39:30.630 --> 39:31.756
Just a minute,
please.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.966
There's nothing more
to talk to you about, jack.

39:33.970 --> 39:35.790
I've got a meeting
with beth in the morning.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.689
Amanda, I--

39:37.700 --> 39:40.408
My father died.

39:42.610 --> 39:44.203
3 months ago.

39:44.210 --> 39:46.076
I didn't know.

39:46.080 --> 39:49.448
He wasn't such
a good guy.

39:49.450 --> 39:51.316
You knew that.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.612
And neither am I.

39:55.620 --> 39:59.318
I am sorry
for your loss,

39:59.330 --> 40:01.822
But whatever your grief
is coughing up right now

40:01.830 --> 40:02.922
Doesn't concern me.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.159
I get it.
You blame your father

40:04.160 --> 40:06.254
For all of your bad
behavior, and you should.

40:06.270 --> 40:11.265
He didn't give you one too
to cope with in this world,

40:11.270 --> 40:13.136
But I don't blame
your father.

40:13.140 --> 40:14.301
I only blame you.

40:14.310 --> 40:16.870
I know I hurt you,
and I can't undo it,

40:16.880 --> 40:18.439
But this is it, amanda.

40:18.450 --> 40:19.906
I'm begging you.

40:19.910 --> 40:22.345
I can change my life.

40:22.350 --> 40:25.547
I promise you I'll
stay away from ethan.

40:25.550 --> 40:26.847
Please just let me stay.

40:26.850 --> 40:28.545
I can make it here,
I can make it work.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.255
I know I can.
I can prove it.

40:30.260 --> 40:32.718
Maybe--maybe not
today or tomorrow,

40:32.730 --> 40:34.880
But one day, you'll see.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.083
See what?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.454
[sighs]

40:37.460 --> 40:38.450
A different man.

40:38.470 --> 40:39.892
And what's gonna
happen then?

40:39.900 --> 40:41.265
I don't know.
We're not there yet,

40:41.270 --> 40:42.590
But anything
could happen.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.137
Change brings change.

40:45.140 --> 40:49.236
You're right. I haven't
been a good father,

40:49.240 --> 40:52.733
But maybe one day,
I-I can be.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.945
You won't have
a sitter,

40:53.950 --> 40:55.270
And trent
will be working,

40:55.280 --> 40:57.271
And you'll need someone
to take care of ethan.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.816
Maybe you'll pick up
the phone and call me,

40:58.820 --> 41:04.156
And I can--I can take
him to eat or a movie.

41:06.190 --> 41:10.559
That's not gonna
happen, jack.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.392
Ok.

41:14.130 --> 41:16.667
Let me stay anyway.

41:18.500 --> 41:21.333
I got nowhere else
to go.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.834
I don't know, jack.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.978
My minute's up.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.789
You listened. That's all
I could hope for.
