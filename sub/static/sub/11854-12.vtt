WEBVTT

00:17.333 --> 00:19.000
- Hey. Two bucks.
- Here you go.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.125
- Thanks.
- Later, Murph.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.583
$1.29.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.375
I only have a dollar.

00:33.458 --> 00:36.417
- Is this for school?
- Yeah.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.583
Alright, then.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.208
Education's important.

00:39.291 --> 00:41.792
You don't want to end up
like those mutts on the
corner.

00:47.792 --> 00:48.959
Get out of here.

00:49.041 --> 00:51.667
- Be careful.
- Thanks, mister.

01:54.458 --> 01:57.166
(Lilly)
'Boss!'

01:57.250 --> 01:59.083
Takeout's getting cold.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.875
Vera's wolfing down the
last of the sweet and
sour.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.542
Okay.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.959
The Sixers traded Allen Iverson.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.667
Uh-huh.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.667
Boss..

02:15.750 --> 02:16.709
...food's here.

02:16.792 --> 02:19.125
Oh, thanks, Lil.
I'm not hungry.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.875
You got something
on a cold one?

02:21.959 --> 02:23.792
No, I just come down
to take a look at that case

02:23.875 --> 02:24.834
'every once in a while.'

02:24.917 --> 02:26.709
Any reason?

02:26.792 --> 02:28.959
Tender age.
The kid was eight.

02:29.041 --> 02:30.750
Your job?

02:42.041 --> 02:44.333
(Greg)
'No! No!'

02:44.417 --> 02:46.000
'No!'

02:46.083 --> 02:47.542
'No!'

02:47.625 --> 02:49.458
My little boy!

02:49.542 --> 02:52.709
- Tim!
- Calm down, please. Sir.

02:52.792 --> 02:54.333
[sobbing]
Tim!

02:56.125 --> 02:57.709
'Tim!'

02:57.792 --> 02:59.041
Any good leads?

02:59.125 --> 03:00.875
Oh, plenty.
None panned out.

03:00.959 --> 03:03.208
Three black teenagers
were the main suspects.

03:03.291 --> 03:06.750
We nearly had a race riot in the
neighborhood when the kid died.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.041
You wanna take a look at it?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.333
You got something new on it?

03:14.417 --> 03:17.166
No. You got fresh eyes.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.667
Maybe you'll see
something I missed.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.250
Any reason
you're looking back now?

03:22.333 --> 03:23.333
Today?

03:26.250 --> 03:27.583
What am I,
one of your suspects?

03:27.667 --> 03:30.125
Well, you're avoiding
my questions like one.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.458
Alright.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.375
I can take a hint.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.166
Be mysterious.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.542
Tim Barnes was
hit once in the face

04:18.625 --> 04:21.500
below the right eye,
presumably knocked unconscious.

04:21.583 --> 04:22.875
He died of hypothermia.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.667
No prints, no witnesses.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.166
The lead suspect was
a 16-year-old glue-sniffer

04:27.250 --> 04:28.709
named Latrell Richmond.

04:28.792 --> 04:31.125
'Juvenile record
of assault and burglary.'

04:31.208 --> 04:33.333
He and his pals hung out
at a corner by the store

04:33.417 --> 04:35.333
where Tim Barnes
bought that notebook.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.333
You interview him?

04:37.417 --> 04:38.542
That night.

04:38.625 --> 04:41.500
So after the boy
goes into the store?

04:41.583 --> 04:43.709
(Latrell)
'I saw him leave.'

04:43.792 --> 04:45.458
Headed North on Grover.

04:45.542 --> 04:46.667
'What did you do after you saw'

04:46.750 --> 04:48.834
the boy walking North on Grover?

04:48.917 --> 04:50.667
Nothing. Chilled.

04:50.750 --> 04:54.250
You didn't follow him,
maybe try and rob him?

04:54.333 --> 04:56.917
You deaf, Stillman?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.458
'I gotta repeat everything?'

04:59.542 --> 05:02.875
Anyone see you chillin'
out
on the corner, Latrell?

05:02.959 --> 05:04.625
Other than your two friends?

05:04.709 --> 05:07.667
No. It was-it was cold out.
Nobody was out.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.000
What about Mr. Murphy,
the store clerk?

05:10.083 --> 05:12.041
- He see you chillin'?
- How do I know?

05:12.125 --> 05:13.917
I stayed away
from that white boy.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.625
Cracker hates the black man
just like the Philly PD.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.542
We released him
into his mother's custody.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.667
We were gonna
box him in the morning

05:23.750 --> 05:24.875
but he'd disappeared by then.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.250
How about his two friends?

05:26.333 --> 05:28.250
They were polygraphed.
Both passed.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.709
One is dead now and
the other's serving time

05:30.792 --> 05:31.792
won't talk to cops.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.041
Latrell's mom around?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.750
Yeah, she and his
two sisters always claimed

05:34.834 --> 05:36.875
they had no idea where he went.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.333
Let's fan out.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.625
I'll go to the parents.
You go to the store clerk.

05:40.709 --> 05:42.583
The clerk was the
last
to see Tim alive?

05:42.667 --> 05:43.959
Yeah.

05:44.041 --> 05:47.750
Maybe Jeffries and Vera can
pay Latrell's family a visit.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.250
Good.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.542
Tim loved delivering the mail
with his dad in the summer.

05:56.792 --> 05:57.792
(Lilly)
'Your other two?'

05:57.875 --> 05:59.959
Uh, that's Tina in California.

06:00.041 --> 06:01.583
She's a vet now, lives in
Modesto.

06:01.667 --> 06:02.667
- Mm-hmm.
- And that's Brian.

06:02.750 --> 06:03.709
He's my youngest.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.375
He's a law student
up at Syracuse.

06:05.458 --> 06:06.917
Oh.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.125
Oh, Greg, honey.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.750
'Uh, this is Detective Rush.'

06:10.834 --> 06:13.125
- She's here about Tim.
- What about him?

06:13.208 --> 06:16.667
I'd like to talk to you
about the night he was killed.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.917
Lieutenant Stillman sent me.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.083
- He's lieutenant now, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.417
He was a nice man.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.709
I told her it was okay.
I can handle it.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.375
Alright.

06:35.458 --> 06:38.792
You wanna know what happened
that night, I'll tell you.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.000
Once.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.583
Hey, mom, can I go to the
store
to buy a notebook for math?

06:45.667 --> 06:47.041
- Ask your father.
- I got a dollar.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.291
- I'll pay for it.
- I said ask your father.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.458
(Greg Barnes)
'Stop Screaming.'

06:54.291 --> 06:55.458
(Tina)
'Hey, dad, don't hurt.'

06:55.542 --> 06:56.875
Hey, dad can I go to the store

06:56.959 --> 06:58.750
to buy a notebook
for math class?

06:58.834 --> 07:00.458
Tina, your hair's
gotta be washed.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.625
- 'Dad.'
- No, it doesn't.

07:01.709 --> 07:02.917
- Dad.
- What?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.083
Can I go to the
store
to buy a notebook?

07:05.166 --> 07:07.375
- Ask your mother.
- But she said to ask you.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.166
Are we done, daddy?

07:09.250 --> 07:13.250
- I said stop squirming.
- Forget you.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.291
Tina, come on, stop squirming.

07:18.959 --> 07:22.125
You have kids, detective?

07:22.208 --> 07:23.875
Because you don't know
the meaning of exhaustion

07:23.959 --> 07:25.792
until you've had
a colicky newborn

07:25.875 --> 07:27.542
on top of two others.

07:27.625 --> 07:30.000
(Greg)
'We were outgunned,
weren't we, honey?'

07:30.083 --> 07:31.417
Three against two.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.667
How much time passed before
you noticed Tim was missing?

07:34.750 --> 07:37.834
Um...two..

07:37.917 --> 07:39.875
'...two and a half hours.'

07:39.959 --> 07:41.792
That's how nuts we were.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.208
Then what'd you do?

07:43.291 --> 07:44.458
We called Tim's friends.

07:44.542 --> 07:47.667
Um, checked around the block

07:47.750 --> 07:50.417
and pretty soon we got scared,
so we called the cops.

07:50.500 --> 07:54.000
By the time they found him..

07:54.083 --> 07:56.208
...Tim was frozen to death.

07:56.291 --> 07:59.583
If we would have just
noticed him missing earlier..

07:59.667 --> 08:01.291
It's okay, sweetie.

08:03.458 --> 08:07.000
Like I said, once is all
I'm gonna tell that story.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.500
Hey, hey! Hey!

08:14.583 --> 08:17.041
Watch that.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.917
Wilma Richmond?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.333
Detectives Vera, Jeffries.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.667
My daughters told me
you called them.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.333
You ain't gonna
get nothing outta me

08:29.417 --> 08:30.750
you didn't get outta my girls.

08:30.834 --> 08:32.417
Think maybe we can
come in, Ms. Wilma?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.041
Yeah, we're, uh,
sitting ducks out
here.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.875
- And it's cold.
- Don't bother the kids none.

08:36.959 --> 08:39.083
Besides, you got blubber on you.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.500
We'll only be a minute.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.917
So your daughters say
they haven't seen Latrell

08:51.000 --> 08:53.333
since the night
he disappeared in
1980.

08:53.417 --> 08:56.417
- Ditto.
- No phone calls, letters?

08:56.500 --> 08:58.125
What did I just say?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.166
Besides, if I knew
where Latrell was

09:02.250 --> 09:03.458
which I don't

09:03.542 --> 09:05.375
you think I'd tell you?

09:06.542 --> 09:07.458
Don't hear me wrong.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.500
I feel bad for that family

09:09.583 --> 09:12.417
but they're not the only ones
lost a boy that night.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.500
I lost my son the same

09:15.583 --> 09:17.041
as they lost theirs.

09:17.125 --> 09:18.583
(Nick Vera)
'So what happened that night'

09:18.667 --> 09:21.583
after you brought
Latrell home from
Homicide?

09:23.041 --> 09:25.625
I don't like to
think about that night.

09:25.709 --> 09:27.959
- We can understand that.
- Oh, yeah?

09:28.041 --> 09:30.875
- You lost a boy, detective?
- No, ma'am.

09:30.959 --> 09:34.250
Then why are you talking
about understanding?

09:34.333 --> 09:36.208
Trell was my eldest.

09:36.291 --> 09:39.166
The man of the house..

09:39.250 --> 09:41.500
...but he was still just a boy.

09:41.583 --> 09:44.250
We'll get us a lawyer,
Trell.
You ain't gotta run.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.166
We can't afford no lawyer.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.834
Where are you gonna go?

09:48.917 --> 09:50.083
Don't know,
but if I stay here

09:50.166 --> 09:52.250
the police will beat
my ass till I confess.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.542
Pin this murder on me.
You know they will.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.834
- You got any money?
- No.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.792
Here.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.166
- I'm not cleaning you out,
mom.
- Take it.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.875
16 years old.

10:29.291 --> 10:32.500
Can you imagine
how scared he was?

10:34.667 --> 10:37.208
Your grandkids?

10:37.291 --> 10:39.083
From my daughters.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.917
Thank God I at least have them.

10:43.834 --> 10:45.417
Now if you don't mind

10:45.500 --> 10:49.417
why don't you go harass some
other innocent black people?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.250
Sean Murphy.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.375
Call me Murph, everyone does.

11:02.458 --> 11:03.417
You're a long way from clerking

11:03.500 --> 11:05.709
at the five-and-dime, Murph.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.333
That's what a
little
hard work can do.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.291
So..

11:09.375 --> 11:10.750
...this is about Tim Barnes?

11:10.834 --> 11:13.250
I understand you were the
last person to see him alive.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.083
Aside from whoever killed him.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.917
He bought something
from your store?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.542
A black-and-white
composition book.

11:19.625 --> 11:21.959
Was Tim a kid you knew
from the neighborhood?

11:22.041 --> 11:23.667
He came into
the store
occasionally.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.500
Never had enough money.
I'd let him slide.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.750
- Felt sorry for him.
- Why is that?

11:28.834 --> 11:30.500
There were these black
kids
in the area.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.250
I think they
were
picking on him.

11:32.333 --> 11:33.583
They do that a lot?

11:33.667 --> 11:34.792
They were always
hanging around the
corner

11:34.875 --> 11:36.375
harassing people.

11:36.458 --> 11:39.417
Mutts had the lazy gene,
if you know what I mean.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.458
You see Tim with
them mutts that night?

11:41.542 --> 11:43.625
You bet I did.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.208
(male #1)
'Hey.'

12:02.375 --> 12:03.750
They ever bother you?

12:03.834 --> 12:05.166
No, they knew better.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.959
- You know this guy?
- 'Yeah.'

12:10.041 --> 12:12.458
Yeah, he was
the ringleader of those
kids.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.792
- Laquanda or something.
- Latrell.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.709
You didn't actually see
him or any of his pals

12:16.792 --> 12:17.959
hurt the boy though, did you?

12:18.041 --> 12:19.709
If I would have seen something

12:19.792 --> 12:20.959
I would have intervened.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.166
I would have kicked those..

12:23.250 --> 12:26.417
...African American
young gentlemen's
asses.

12:31.583 --> 12:34.333
The Barnes speak highly of you.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.500
How are they doing?

12:36.583 --> 12:38.667
Getting by, I guess.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.417
That kind of wound doesn't heal.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.125
I used to call them a lot.

12:42.208 --> 12:45.333
I-I stopped when I didn't
have anything new to tell
them.

12:45.417 --> 12:48.083
- You buying baby furniture?
- No, it's my daughter.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.417
- She's pregnant.
- How far along?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.000
A couple of
months.
I just found out.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.250
Anything from Latrell's family?

12:57.333 --> 12:59.583
Mother and sisters are
sticking to their stories.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.834
- You think he could be dead?
- I doubt it.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.417
Latrell was a survivor of sorts.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.959
So is that the new direction?

13:07.041 --> 13:09.000
Hearing
your daughter's pregnant?

13:09.083 --> 13:12.125
It got me thinking
about this case,
yeah..

13:12.208 --> 13:14.583
...and feeling guilty.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.583
About what?

13:15.667 --> 13:16.875
I was working the Barnes job

13:16.959 --> 13:19.500
when my daughter was born.

13:19.583 --> 13:23.291
Yeah, I missed
her birth
completely.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.083
My wife, uh..

13:27.166 --> 13:29.208
...wasn't pleased.

13:29.291 --> 13:32.500
I lost my marriage over a
case
I couldn't even solve.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.709
Well, no wonder
you don't want back on it.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.375
The sad part is, I do, though.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.834
I want this thing
solved.
I want to put to
rest.

13:43.583 --> 13:46.208
I get it.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.291
No, you don't..

13:47.375 --> 13:50.083
...but you will one day.

13:50.166 --> 13:52.000
Hopefully before I did.

13:55.792 --> 13:57.250
Murphy's a piece of work

13:57.333 --> 14:00.291
into genetics,
racial superiority.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.333
He thinks Latrell's the doer?

14:02.417 --> 14:04.709
ID'ed him off
his picture in a second
flat.

14:04.792 --> 14:05.959
We got something.

14:06.041 --> 14:07.917
Latrell's two
sisters,
Lisa and Leslie.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.250
They got three kids apiece.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.917
'But according
to Wilma Richmond'

14:11.000 --> 14:12.166
she has seven grandkids.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.250
Yeah, so who's
lucky number seven?

14:15.333 --> 14:17.333
Thinking maybe he's Latrell's?

14:17.417 --> 14:18.875
We're gonna find out.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.667
We're on the street, boss.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.417
Us, too.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.083
- Going to the crime scene.
- Good.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.083
Ain't too often we got
the assigned available

14:28.166 --> 14:29.208
to go with us.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.625
Uh-huh.

14:30.709 --> 14:32.792
Come on, boss.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.250
Be a big help.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.125
I'll get my coat.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.625
Used to be a working
class neighborhood.

14:49.709 --> 14:52.375
Half black, half white.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.750
A lot of racial tension.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.583
This is where Tim died.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.208
Except he was lying
in snow, not slush.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.792
That coffee shop
there
was a five-and-dime

15:19.875 --> 15:21.709
where Tim Barnes
bought his
notebook.

15:21.792 --> 15:23.250
Where Murphy worked.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.250
In this corner right here

15:27.667 --> 15:30.291
this is where Latrell
and his pals were sniffing
glue.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.667
Even the church is
getting a facelift.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.333
(Scotty Valens)
'The Barnes
were Catholics, right?'

15:38.417 --> 15:40.417
(John)
'Yeah. Tim was
in the boys' choir.'

15:40.500 --> 15:41.542
(Lilly)
'You talk to the priest?'

15:41.625 --> 15:42.709
Yeah, Father Declan.

15:42.792 --> 15:44.041
He was in the church
that night

15:44.125 --> 15:45.166
but he didn't see
or hear anything.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.250
There wasn't
a pedophilia scandal

15:46.333 --> 15:48.667
back in 1980, was there?

15:48.750 --> 15:50.625
No. Just pedophilia.

15:50.709 --> 15:51.834
Oh, what, the guy's a priest

15:51.917 --> 15:53.125
so automatically
he's a pedophile?

15:53.208 --> 15:55.959
No, but don't
we
got to look at
it?

15:56.041 --> 15:57.291
Well, he was close to the family

15:57.375 --> 15:59.333
both the parents and the kids.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.083
Diocese won't disclose
the priest's whereabouts

16:05.166 --> 16:07.542
without a court order.

16:07.625 --> 16:11.500
Oh, you got a relationship
with ADA Kite, right?

16:11.583 --> 16:13.542
What do you mean,
"a relationship?"

16:13.625 --> 16:15.041
I mean, maybe you can
give him a call.

16:15.125 --> 16:18.166
He could help us, uh,
cut through the red tape.

16:18.250 --> 16:21.500
Yeah, I...could call him.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.875
Did a search of
Latrell's
mother's phone
records.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.125
Other than her daughters

16:25.208 --> 16:27.000
one other name
comes up consistently.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.125
- It's Candace Smith.
- Who's that?

16:29.208 --> 16:31.917
36-year-old nurse
with a 14-year-old boy.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.542
Now Wilma Richmond had a picture

16:33.625 --> 16:35.375
of her kid in her apartment.

16:35.458 --> 16:36.583
Looks to be about 14.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.417
The seventh grandkid?

16:38.500 --> 16:39.709
(Nick)
'Latrell's, maybe.'

16:39.792 --> 16:41.375
With Candace.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.458
Wilma told you to talk to me?

16:44.542 --> 16:46.667
We're here about
her son, Latrell.

16:46.750 --> 16:47.959
Latrell?

16:48.041 --> 16:50.500
Well, that's a name
I haven't heard in a long
time.

16:50.583 --> 16:52.667
Um..

16:52.750 --> 16:54.166
...this is a picture of him.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.750
That there was Latrell.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.542
A couple of names back, that is.

16:57.625 --> 17:01.333
When I married him,
he was going by Julius
Smith.

17:01.417 --> 17:03.583
(Nick)
'Your boy sure looks like
him.'

17:03.667 --> 17:06.375
Don't remind me.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.417
You wouldn't happen to know
where Julius is, would you?

17:09.500 --> 17:12.917
Michael, want to
give us some
privacy?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Like I never heard you
badmouthing Julius before.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.542
Go.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.667
Julius Smith is
a low-rent,
two-timing

17:24.750 --> 17:26.709
'piss-poor excuse of a man.'

17:26.792 --> 17:29.667
Kicked his worthless
butt
out the door six years
ago.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.917
He doesn't call,
pay child support?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.291
Child support?

17:33.375 --> 17:35.625
The day he left,
he cleaned me and Michael
out.

17:35.709 --> 17:37.583
'Took his own son's Game Boy.'

17:37.667 --> 17:39.375
- He an addict?
- Addict, dealer.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.583
Last I heard, he was
hustling out of the
Badlands.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.834
But what did he do now?

17:43.917 --> 17:45.250
You know what?
Don't tell me.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.333
I don't want to know.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.625
You find Julius Latrell

17:48.709 --> 17:50.166
whatever the hell his name is

17:50.250 --> 17:52.875
tell him his son's
a straight-A
student.

17:52.959 --> 17:54.875
He's grown up
to be a real
man

17:54.959 --> 17:58.083
not like his lying ass.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.667
Yes, ma'am,
we most definitely will.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.166
(ADA Kite)
'I went to law school
with Sherman Markey'

18:06.250 --> 18:07.375
one of the diocese's attorneys.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.667
He spared us the rigmarole.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.333
Your Father Declan's
in a retirement home

18:11.417 --> 18:13.458
for priests put
out to pasture.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.375
"Sacred Heart Retirement Home."

18:17.083 --> 18:18.750
Thanks, Kite.

18:18.834 --> 18:21.333
This priest,
he a man-boy-love
type?

18:21.417 --> 18:24.458
I hope not, but either way,
I'll find out.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.417
- See ya.
- See ya?

18:30.583 --> 18:32.125
What do you want,
a thank-you note?

18:32.208 --> 18:33.834
We ever going to talk about
that night on the street?

18:33.917 --> 18:35.500
Talk-talk about that night.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.125
Maybe when this case is over.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.917
But then you'll
be
on another case.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.208
That's true.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.959
I tell you what.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.709
You're the workaholic.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.834
Call me at home.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.667
I don't care what time.

18:54.291 --> 18:55.959
Okay.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.375
Maybe.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.875
Tonight wouldn't be too soon.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.125
(Lilly )
'Father Declan?'

19:13.208 --> 19:14.291
Yeah?

19:14.375 --> 19:16.750
Valens, Rush, homicide.

19:16.834 --> 19:18.375
Mind putting it
on pause for a minute?

19:23.667 --> 19:25.458
What can I do for you?

19:25.542 --> 19:27.792
You remember a boy
named Tim Barnes?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.917
Of
course.
Tragedy.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.667
He was in the boys'
choir at your church.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.834
And on your baseball team,
when you were coaching.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.166
Are you accusing me
of something,
detective?

19:38.250 --> 19:40.291
You were transferred
three months after his murder.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.250
At my request.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.125
I'm not a pedophile.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.875
So, why'd you decide to leave?

19:50.417 --> 19:53.750
My white
parishioners
blamed the blacks.

19:53.834 --> 19:57.083
I cautioned them against
leaping to conclusions.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.000
My position was not popular.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.125
You don't think the black
kids on the corner did it?

20:01.208 --> 20:03.500
It's not for me to say.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.917
In the case file it says
you went to the Barnes house

20:06.000 --> 20:07.125
the day of the murder.

20:07.208 --> 20:10.542
Yes, Greg Barnes asked me to
check on Nicole.

20:12.333 --> 20:15.542
She was having
a hard time
coping.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.917
Needed..

20:17.000 --> 20:18.166
...cheering up.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.166
Tina!

20:25.208 --> 20:28.041
I don't know, father

20:28.125 --> 20:31.166
I-I have these dreams.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.041
What kind of dreams?

20:35.959 --> 20:37.333
Bad ones.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.250
You're tired.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.500
Tired doesn't cover
the half of it.

20:44.583 --> 20:47.125
It's just...three's too many.

20:48.709 --> 20:50.583
Tina, don't do that again!

20:50.667 --> 20:51.625
You see what I mean?

20:51.709 --> 20:53.041
- Mom!
- Not a moment's peace.

20:53.125 --> 20:56.750
- 'Tim hit me.'
- Did you hit your sister?

20:56.834 --> 20:57.834
Did you hit her?

20:57.917 --> 20:59.166
Yeah, did you hit your sister?

20:59.250 --> 21:01.000
- But she made me!
- No buts, Timothy!

21:01.083 --> 21:02.500
I've had it up to here!

21:02.583 --> 21:04.959
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do, huh?

21:05.041 --> 21:06.417
- 'What do I have to do?'
- Nicole, Nicole.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.709
What?

21:12.583 --> 21:13.959
I'm sorry.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.834
Why didn't you ever tell
that to Detective Stillman?

21:19.917 --> 21:22.417
Nicole had suffered enough.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.750
Last thing she needed was
cops breathing down her
neck.

21:25.834 --> 21:28.917
You ever see Nicole hit Timmy?

21:29.000 --> 21:32.041
She was high-strung, emotional.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.917
But did you ever
see her hit the boy?

21:37.333 --> 21:40.041
Did you talk to Nicole
after Tim died?

21:40.125 --> 21:41.709
Confession is a sacrament.

21:41.792 --> 21:44.250
Protected by both
church and state law.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.250
How about her husband Greg?

21:47.333 --> 21:49.667
- Did he come talk to you?
- I couldn't say.

21:49.750 --> 21:50.917
Couldn't or wouldn't?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.500
Someone confessed to
the murder, didn't they?

21:52.583 --> 21:54.041
'That's why
you left the parish.'

21:54.125 --> 21:55.792
You couldn't stand knowing
one of your parishioners

21:55.875 --> 21:56.834
got away with it.

21:56.917 --> 21:59.875
I wouldn't say, regardless.

22:01.291 --> 22:04.041
Even if that person
killed an eight-year-old boy?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.709
Even if.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.375
Father Declan knows something.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.750
You think Tim's
killer confessed to
him?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.667
We already know he was
counseling Nicole Barnes.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.709
And it turns out
she was hospitalized twice

22:20.792 --> 22:22.583
for attempted
suicides since 1980.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.208
Her son was murdered, Lil. It'd
drive any parent over the edge.

22:25.291 --> 22:26.875
According to Declan,
she was over the edge

22:26.959 --> 22:28.500
before Tim was killed.

22:28.583 --> 22:29.917
You must have looked at her.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.417
She said she never
left
the house that night.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.959
Her husband and
neighbors backed her
up.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.959
I got two words for you,
boss. Andrea Yates.

22:36.041 --> 22:38.083
From what Declan says
Nicole fits the postpartum

22:38.166 --> 22:39.583
psychosis bill to a "T."

22:39.667 --> 22:40.750
I'll give you this

22:40.834 --> 22:42.750
in 1980, that wasn't
exactly
on our radar.

22:42.834 --> 22:44.083
I'm gonna talk to her husband.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.291
Don't go to her
until you have
to.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.250
District cops and
BD teams in the Badlands

22:48.333 --> 22:51.625
know of a Julius Smith, Aka
Latrell Richmond, in the
area.

22:51.709 --> 22:54.000
Gave us an idea of what
block he's hustling out of.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.625
You show his picture around?

22:55.709 --> 22:56.792
Door slams everywhere.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.792
Well, we gotta
flush Latrell
out.

22:58.875 --> 23:01.625
Time for "No drugs today?"

23:01.709 --> 23:03.250
Oh, I think so.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.041
What's that?

23:05.125 --> 23:06.625
You'll see.

23:26.166 --> 23:29.583
(Will Jeffries)
'Ms. Town and Country doesn't
know the pharmacy's closed.'

23:29.667 --> 23:31.291
I'll give her the heads up.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.375
No drugs today, ma'am.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.792
You're like
a Swiss watch,
Greg

23:46.875 --> 23:49.458
on your route just where
your boss said you'd be.

23:49.542 --> 23:51.000
What do you want?

23:51.083 --> 23:53.333
To talk about
the night of the
murder.

23:53.417 --> 23:55.375
I've already told you,
once is all you get.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.959
Except you left out
a couple of details.

23:57.041 --> 23:57.875
Like?

23:57.959 --> 23:59.333
Like you asking Father Declan

23:59.417 --> 24:02.166
to look in on Nicole
the day of the
murder.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.291
Leave Nicole out of it.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.166
Are you still in
contact
with Father Declan?

24:06.250 --> 24:08.875
We stopped going to
church after Tim died.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.333
You bring Tim out
on the route sometimes?

24:14.500 --> 24:15.834
'How do you know that?'

24:15.917 --> 24:17.917
Picture on the mantle.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.834
Him wearing
your postal service hat..

24:20.917 --> 24:22.583
...carrying your bag.

24:25.125 --> 24:27.917
He loved to come along..

24:28.000 --> 24:30.583
...carry the bag.

24:30.667 --> 24:31.917
Yeah?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.834
He was a great kid.

24:35.834 --> 24:37.750
Were Tim and his mom close?

24:39.625 --> 24:40.875
She loved him, same as I did.

24:40.959 --> 24:43.583
I don't doubt that but..

24:43.667 --> 24:47.083
...sometimes people..

24:47.166 --> 24:48.542
...mothers..

24:48.625 --> 24:50.375
...they get so overwhelmed

24:50.458 --> 24:52.875
they do things they regret.

24:52.959 --> 24:56.500
Well, Nicole coped
the best she could.

24:56.583 --> 24:57.709
Then why are you
afraid to tell me

24:57.792 --> 24:58.875
what happened that night?

24:58.959 --> 25:01.375
I don't know what happened.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.375
It was chaos, as usual.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.458
Tim. Timmy!

25:08.834 --> 25:10.000
Honey!

25:10.083 --> 25:11.583
Nicole!

25:11.667 --> 25:13.458
Nicole!

25:15.667 --> 25:17.250
Where the hell have you been?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.125
- It's freezing out there.
- I don't feel it.

25:25.208 --> 25:26.583
I don't feel a thing.

25:26.667 --> 25:29.625
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.709
Where's Tim?
I can't find him.

25:33.792 --> 25:36.083
What do you mean
you can't find
him?

25:36.166 --> 25:39.709
Tim!
Tim? Timmy!

25:39.792 --> 25:41.417
I'm gonna go look outside.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.417
Greg!

25:42.500 --> 25:44.792
What?

25:44.875 --> 25:46.000
I'm sorry.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.750
For what?

25:48.834 --> 25:50.792
Three's too many.

25:53.542 --> 25:55.166
Stay here.

26:02.291 --> 26:05.583
Did you ask Nicole
what she was doing outside?

26:05.667 --> 26:06.834
No.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.125
And she never said.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.458
24 years,
you don't discuss it?

26:11.542 --> 26:13.834
My wife is a good woman.

26:13.917 --> 26:16.500
She raised the two
other kids just
right.

26:16.583 --> 26:17.959
Now, if she did
something awful

26:18.041 --> 26:19.750
to Timmy that
night,
it wasn't her.

26:19.834 --> 26:21.834
Do you understand?

26:21.917 --> 26:23.792
It wasn't her.

26:26.333 --> 26:29.500
I'm going to need
to talk to your wife.

26:29.583 --> 26:31.458
Not without me, you're not.

26:53.542 --> 26:54.917
This ain't your corner

26:55.000 --> 26:57.542
and this ain't the beach,
fools.
Why you acting like it is?

26:57.625 --> 27:00.125
We're just taking in the
sights,
ma'am, enjoying the city.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.834
We gotta make
a living same as you.

27:01.917 --> 27:03.375
That's what we're counting on.

27:03.458 --> 27:06.333
How long you gonna
perpetuate this injustice?

27:06.417 --> 27:08.959
However long as it takes
to
locate who we're looking
for.

27:09.041 --> 27:11.375
Maybe I can be
of some assistance.

27:11.458 --> 27:15.208
Maybe then you can vamoose
the hell off of my block.

27:15.291 --> 27:16.500
We're looking for Julius Smith.

27:16.583 --> 27:19.125
Julius?
He ain't worth your time.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.041
Know where we can find him?

27:21.125 --> 27:25.041
Can't rat out a brother,
even if he is a punk-ass.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.291
Suit yourself.
You got any mustard?

27:27.375 --> 27:29.917
Mustard? Hell.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.250
No-good,
mustard-eating mother..

27:34.333 --> 27:35.792
Now we're rolling.

27:35.875 --> 27:39.709
Yeah, she'll get Julius' name
all over the village and
quick.

27:43.792 --> 27:44.917
It's my fault, Nicole.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.709
I never should've
opened my mouth.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.083
No, it's okay, honey.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.166
You're the one who's never
wanted to talk about this.

27:51.250 --> 27:53.458
'I've come to terms
with what I'd done.'

27:53.542 --> 27:55.709
What was that, Nicole?

27:55.792 --> 27:58.667
I went outside..

28:54.166 --> 28:57.417
I prayed with all
my heart and soul.

29:01.834 --> 29:02.834
For what?

29:02.917 --> 29:05.208
For God to
take away my burdens..

29:07.417 --> 29:10.375
...and he did.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.458
He took away Timmy.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.875
Didn't he?

29:23.542 --> 29:26.166
Is that why you stopped
going to church, Nicole?

29:28.542 --> 29:30.834
'Cause you made that prayer?

29:30.917 --> 29:33.875
It's why I tried
to kill myself too.

29:33.959 --> 29:35.667
Why would anyone
wanna live in a world

29:35.750 --> 29:39.875
where God would answer your
prayers by killing your son?

29:46.917 --> 29:49.166
There she is.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.667
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

29:52.750 --> 29:55.583
- You didn't call me.
- Um...you know how it is.

29:57.542 --> 29:59.709
Looks like I'm too
late to buy you
dinner.

29:59.792 --> 30:02.000
- I talked to that priest.
- Guess it'll have to be
drinks.

30:02.083 --> 30:05.667
- What, now?
- Yeah. You mind?

30:05.750 --> 30:08.041
I didn't take you for
a fast-food type, Kite.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.291
You got me all wrong, Rush.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.041
Let me drop these
warrants off at
fugitives

30:12.125 --> 30:14.750
and, uh, we'll go.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.625
- You know what we need?
- We need some marshmallows.

30:19.709 --> 30:21.458
Marshmallows? Hell,
we need a bigger
fire.

30:21.542 --> 30:22.959
I'm freezing my nuts off.

30:23.041 --> 30:25.083
Check it out.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.375
Yo, detectives.

30:30.458 --> 30:31.458
What's up, man?

30:31.542 --> 30:33.875
You're looking
for Julius, right?

30:33.959 --> 30:36.000
- That's right.
- Got a cell?

30:36.083 --> 30:38.250
Number's up top.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.417
I'll see what I can do.

30:42.333 --> 30:43.625
You do that.

30:46.917 --> 30:49.166
Won't be long now.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.125
Should I, uh, go
into the high school years?

30:51.208 --> 30:53.750
You like talking
about
yourself, don't you?

30:55.125 --> 30:57.583
Well, someone has
got to talk about something.

30:57.667 --> 31:00.417
- I talk plenty.
- About work. Nothing good.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.834
What do you want, secrets?

31:02.917 --> 31:04.250
Yeah.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.583
Oh, you letting me in?

31:12.709 --> 31:15.125
Come on, come on,
show me where you live.

31:23.417 --> 31:26.500
- You like cats?
- Sure. Yeah.

31:36.333 --> 31:39.917
- Nice place.
- 'Thanks.'

31:41.041 --> 31:43.291
Oh, dear, God.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.792
I thought you liked cats.

31:44.875 --> 31:48.208
Cats, not...mutants.

31:49.709 --> 31:52.625
- This is Olivia.
- Uh-huh.

31:52.709 --> 31:55.583
And this is..

31:58.375 --> 32:00.667
Tripod?

32:00.750 --> 32:03.291
And you were doing so well.

32:27.583 --> 32:30.291
Uh! Oh, what are you doing?

32:30.375 --> 32:32.375
I wanna see it down.

32:32.458 --> 32:35.041
Oh, I-I don't know about that.

32:36.625 --> 32:38.375
Another time, okay?

32:38.458 --> 32:40.166
Why not now?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.834
Because you're..

32:43.917 --> 32:46.000
...because you're
scaring the cats.

32:48.625 --> 32:52.417
I think you got that
reversed, but, uh, okay.

32:58.208 --> 33:01.375
It's a start...at least.

33:01.458 --> 33:02.542
To what?

33:08.291 --> 33:09.875
The adventure.

33:16.417 --> 33:18.333
See ya.

33:25.333 --> 33:26.458
Got the call an hour ago.

33:26.542 --> 33:28.583
Julius is inside,
probably asleep.

33:28.667 --> 33:29.959
I'm ready.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.917
(male #2)
'Police!'

33:36.000 --> 33:37.834
(male #3)
'Everybody down!'

33:37.917 --> 33:39.625
Alright, police!
Everybody down!

33:39.709 --> 33:40.875
(male #4)
'Down! Now!'

33:40.959 --> 33:42.583
(male #5)
'We're upstairs!'

33:49.458 --> 33:50.750
Hey, where you going?
Come over here!

33:50.834 --> 33:52.250
Come on, hands up!

33:52.333 --> 33:53.834
- Julius Smith. Where is he?
- I don't know, man.

33:53.917 --> 33:55.625
- I don't know.
- What do you got here?

33:55.709 --> 33:59.542
- What you doing, man?
- What's that, huh?

33:59.625 --> 34:00.917
Julius Smith. Where is he?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.166
Come on, lady.
Those are my rocks.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.166
Come on, please.

34:05.041 --> 34:08.250
Julius Smith, where is he?

34:10.250 --> 34:13.041
In the bag, over there.

34:15.208 --> 34:16.625
Julius Smith.

34:16.709 --> 34:18.250
(Scotty Valens)
'Latrell?'

34:18.333 --> 34:20.458
Latrell?

34:20.542 --> 34:23.000
We gotta bust a cap
here,
see if he moves.

34:23.083 --> 34:26.125
Show me your hands.
Lemme see your hands!

34:32.000 --> 34:34.834
Time's done a real number
on you, hasn't it, Latrell?

34:34.917 --> 34:35.792
Latrell?

34:35.875 --> 34:38.583
I don't know any Latrell.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.834
Ah, man..

34:45.917 --> 34:48.083
...you're still around.

34:48.166 --> 34:51.917
Where'd all your hair
disappear to,
Stillman?

34:52.000 --> 34:55.250
Same place as
your teeth, Latrell.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.333
Give us a minute, guys.

35:09.083 --> 35:10.667
Why'd you do it, Latrell?

35:10.750 --> 35:12.583
Why'd you kill Tim Barnes?

35:15.125 --> 35:17.291
I didn't kill nobody.

35:17.375 --> 35:19.458
I didn't believe you then
and I don't believe you
now.

35:19.542 --> 35:22.375
You ruined my life,
you know that, Stillman?

35:22.458 --> 35:23.709
The parents of that kid

35:23.792 --> 35:26.250
the brother and
sister of that
kid

35:26.333 --> 35:27.667
their lives were ruined.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.667
'This case took a toll
on a lot of people.'

35:29.750 --> 35:32.625
- Except you.
- No.

35:32.709 --> 35:34.375
Me too, Latrell.

35:34.458 --> 35:37.208
That boy's death really
messed with your head

35:37.291 --> 35:38.208
didn't it, Stillman?

35:38.291 --> 35:39.375
That boy's name was--

35:39.458 --> 35:41.542
Tim Barnes.
Tim Barnes!

35:41.625 --> 35:43.041
You don't think I know that?

35:46.000 --> 35:49.083
You don't think that
boy's death bothered me none?

35:49.166 --> 35:51.291
Maybe there's a detail
or two type factoid

35:51.375 --> 35:54.041
I failed to mention
way back when.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.417
Come here, man.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.375
'Hey, you hear?'

36:05.458 --> 36:06.875
I said come here.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.500
Come here. Where you think
you goin', little man, huh?

36:09.583 --> 36:10.917
- Nowhere.
- 'Nowhere?'

36:11.000 --> 36:12.291
- The store.
- Yeah.

36:12.375 --> 36:13.709
You're damn right,
you're goin' to the store.

36:13.792 --> 36:15.250
- You know why?
- Leave me alone.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.709
You gonna buy us some glue,
you hear me, potsie?

36:17.792 --> 36:19.208
I only have a dollar.

36:19.291 --> 36:21.250
Well, that's
your problem, okay?

36:21.333 --> 36:24.500
'Cause you go in that cracker
store and not bring us our
glue

36:24.583 --> 36:26.917
you're gonna wish your
little ass was never
born.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.583
You understand?

36:29.667 --> 36:31.250
Good.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.083
Hey, potsie..

36:35.166 --> 36:38.083
...don't be bringing us none
of that Elmer's glue,
neither.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.875
Model glue, you hear me?

36:49.917 --> 36:51.792
Why the hell
didn't you tell me
that?

36:51.875 --> 36:53.125
Come on, Stillman.

36:53.208 --> 36:54.458
Like I'm gonna tell the police

36:54.542 --> 36:56.250
I threatened to whoop
a white boy's ass

36:56.333 --> 36:59.667
the same night
that white boy gets dead?

36:59.750 --> 37:01.834
If you didn't do it..

37:01.917 --> 37:03.250
...and you haven't
said anything yet

37:03.333 --> 37:05.583
that tells me you
didn't,
then who did?

37:09.208 --> 37:13.291
If you got any ideas,
Latrell, now is the
time.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.458
That night

37:18.542 --> 37:20.417
when I was leaving my ma's.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.750
I seen that cracker, Murphy

37:22.834 --> 37:24.792
knockin' on the church door.

37:24.875 --> 37:28.000
One of them priests
come out of the, uh..

37:28.083 --> 37:30.291
What do you call them places
where the priests live?

37:30.375 --> 37:31.917
- Rectory.
- Right.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.834
Rectumry.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.542
Dude was wearing
some funky-ass

37:36.625 --> 37:38.792
Phillies pajamas.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.500
Did Murphy go back
inside with him?

37:40.583 --> 37:42.583
No. It got me thinking.

37:42.667 --> 37:45.542
Why's Murphy in need
of spiritual-type counseling?

37:46.834 --> 37:48.125
Think about it, Stillman.

37:48.208 --> 37:51.208
Now, that cracker, Murphy,
he got the-the opportunity

37:51.291 --> 37:53.291
and the motive
to kill that boy.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.625
Well, I'll give you
opportunity,
Latrell, but motive?

37:58.709 --> 38:01.583
I got it all figured out.

38:01.667 --> 38:03.041
You kill a white boy, right?

38:03.125 --> 38:04.166
Blame it on the black man!

38:04.250 --> 38:05.291
What happens?

38:05.375 --> 38:07.291
Cops come in, crime go down.

38:07.375 --> 38:10.625
Crime go down,
the real estate prices go up.

38:11.792 --> 38:14.125
Now, I ask you..

38:14.208 --> 38:16.792
...who stood to benefit?

38:16.875 --> 38:19.709
The man buying up all
the real estate, am I right?

38:19.792 --> 38:20.834
And who that?

38:20.917 --> 38:24.709
Sean Crackerjack Murphy,
that's who.

38:26.208 --> 38:28.208
That is one hell
of a theory,
Latrell.

38:28.291 --> 38:29.875
It ain't a theory.

38:29.959 --> 38:33.959
That's a hypothesis, Stillman.

38:38.375 --> 38:41.375
Well, now that we got
motive all squared away..

38:42.625 --> 38:45.917
- Crazy theory.
- Hypothesis.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
But Murphy going to the priest
is pretty interesting.

38:48.083 --> 38:49.208
Yeah, in the middle of the night

38:49.291 --> 38:50.667
just hours
after Tim Barnes
died.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.041
Someone confessed
to Father Declan, boss.

38:53.125 --> 38:56.291
But why would Murphy
kill that kid?

38:56.375 --> 38:57.291
Ask Father Declan.

38:57.375 --> 38:58.291
Oh, Declan hasn't broken

38:58.375 --> 39:00.041
his vow of silence in 24 years.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.709
He ain't gonna break it now.

39:02.792 --> 39:04.959
Maybe he doesn't
need to break it.

39:05.041 --> 39:08.291
Maybe we just need to make
Murphy think he's broken it.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.834
I appreciate your
coming down, father.

39:11.917 --> 39:14.792
And I apologize for giving you
a hard time the other day.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.750
- Don't mention it.
- Oh, here.

39:18.166 --> 39:21.125
So...tell me your idea.

39:21.208 --> 39:23.792
Ah, what I was thinking was this

39:23.875 --> 39:25.417
a baseball league for cops.

39:25.500 --> 39:26.959
The problem is,
I don't know where to begin.

39:27.041 --> 39:29.083
And you, you've got experience
starting up a league, right?

39:29.166 --> 39:31.291
Oh, that was a long time ago.

39:31.375 --> 39:33.500
Well, I could
really use some pointers.

39:33.583 --> 39:36.917
Okay, give me that paper here.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.208
(Sean Murphy)
'That Latrell.'

39:38.291 --> 39:40.750
Ha! Must have been
smokin' way too much crack

39:40.834 --> 39:41.834
coming up with that theory.

39:41.917 --> 39:43.208
I know..

39:43.291 --> 39:45.250
'...pretty far-fetched,
except you did get rich'

39:45.333 --> 39:47.709
'off real estate,
didn't you?'

39:47.792 --> 39:48.792
Where is he?

39:48.875 --> 39:51.792
I-I can't wait to ID
his worthless ass.

39:54.041 --> 39:57.125
Where's the lineup?
Where's Latrell?

39:57.208 --> 39:59.792
We gotta have a
conversation
first.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.625
Alright.

40:01.709 --> 40:04.917
You were the detective
on that kid's case.

40:06.125 --> 40:07.542
And you were
the kind store
owner

40:07.625 --> 40:09.291
who let Tim slide
when he only had a
dollar

40:09.375 --> 40:11.041
for that notebook.

40:11.125 --> 40:13.041
That's right.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.625
Have a seat.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.500
I never guessed

40:28.583 --> 40:29.709
it would be
you sitting in
here.

40:29.792 --> 40:31.208
We're exhuming
Tim's body, Murph.

40:31.291 --> 40:33.000
In 1980, we
didn't
have DNA testing

40:33.083 --> 40:36.750
but it's a whole
new ball game in
2004.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.083
You don't mind, do you?

40:43.250 --> 40:46.500
I came here to identify
that boy's killer

40:46.583 --> 40:47.750
'Latrell Richmond.'

40:47.834 --> 40:50.542
When's that gonna happen?

40:50.625 --> 40:52.500
Did you see Detective
Valens
out there, Murph

40:52.583 --> 40:54.542
'taking down
Father Declan's statement?'

40:54.625 --> 40:57.166
He shed a lot of
light on this job.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.458
Told us how you knocked on
the church door that night.

40:59.542 --> 41:01.208
How he opened it in his pajamas

41:01.291 --> 41:03.375
let you in to confess
to Tim's murder.

41:03.458 --> 41:06.375
Well, a priest can't talk
about
what he hears in confession.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.000
(John Stillman)
'That's true.'

41:10.083 --> 41:13.333
Except Declan's retired.

41:13.417 --> 41:14.583
(Lilly)
'And bitter.'

41:14.667 --> 41:16.542
No allegiance
to the church anymore

41:16.625 --> 41:19.000
not after all the scandals.

41:21.417 --> 41:24.417
You...you hate little
kids,
is that it, Murph?

41:24.500 --> 41:26.417
I don't hate little kids.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.250
Just black kids.

41:28.333 --> 41:29.583
Tim Barnes was
white, remember?

41:29.667 --> 41:30.917
But he was a thief.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.917
He stole glue from you

41:33.000 --> 41:35.083
for those black kids.

41:39.709 --> 41:42.583
That's an ungrateful
mutt for you.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.750
He betrayed you, huh?

41:46.834 --> 41:48.750
Not just me. Us.

41:48.834 --> 41:52.083
Guys who work an honest day
for an honest wage.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.583
White guys.

41:57.458 --> 42:00.208
Thanks, mister.

42:30.709 --> 42:32.917
(Sean Murphy)
'Hey! Hey!'

42:33.000 --> 42:34.667
Come here!
You little mutt!

42:39.709 --> 42:41.041
You think you
can steal from
me?

42:41.125 --> 42:43.583
- They made me.
- Don't lie to me, mutt.
