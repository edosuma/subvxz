00:31.129 --> 00:34.594
- You should be sitting.
- That's okay. I'm fine.

00:35.428 --> 00:39.977
Excuse me, would you mind giving
your seat to this lady?

00:40.896 --> 00:43.776
- Didn't you hear me-?
- I heard you!

00:44.151 --> 00:47.950
- It's okay, I can stand.
- She's pregnant!

00:48.116 --> 00:53.000
- That's, like, my problem?
- A little common courtesy-

00:53.209 --> 00:55.755
Sorry, Pops. I got none.

00:56.214 --> 00:58.760
Really, it's okay. Thank you.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.483
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.614
- You sure?
- Just a few scrapes.

01:11.407 --> 01:13.160
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:23.177 --> 01:25.598
Ice-blended mocha supremo.

01:25.807 --> 01:28.728
Ice-blended mocha supremo.

01:28.937 --> 01:31.858
You're a lucky girl, having a baby.

01:32.025 --> 01:35.156
- How far along are you?
- Six months.

01:35.365 --> 01:38.704
- You're getting big!
- Thanks. Twins.

01:38.870 --> 01:41.875
My niece had twins. What a delivery!

01:42.085 --> 01:46.134
18 hours on the first one.
The second was breech.

01:46.342 --> 01:50.891
- Excuse me, ma'am. Your order?
- Regular coffee, please.

01:52.310 --> 01:55.733
I'm sure yours will go
just fine. May I?

01:55.942 --> 02:00.366
I'd rather you not. It's just that
when you're pregnant-

02:00.575 --> 02:04.915
Everyone wants to touch you
without even asking.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.752
Although I did ask.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.508
- Regular coffee.
- Thank you.

02:11.385 --> 02:15.225
Tall warm milk to go, please.

02:15.392 --> 02:16.477
Nasty.

02:17.855 --> 02:21.152
- Excuse me?
- Warm milk is nasty.

02:21.569 --> 02:25.952
- Really? What are you having?
- Double vanilla latte.

02:26.119 --> 02:29.541
Did you know that coffee
stunts your growth?

02:29.959 --> 02:31.420
That's so not true.

02:31.628 --> 02:34.842
- Your parents let you drink it?
- Are you the coffee police?

02:35.050 --> 02:37.054
- Tall warm milk.
- Thanks.

02:38.599 --> 02:41.770
Double tall vanilla latte.

02:42.187 --> 02:44.817
- My balloon!
- We've got another one.

02:44.984 --> 02:48.115
- I don't want blue!
- It's just as good.

02:48.324 --> 02:50.243
- Don't make a scene.
- I want yellow!

02:50.452 --> 02:52.539
It's a perfectly good balloon.

02:55.335 --> 02:58.340
- My God! Watch out!
- Get out of the way!

04:03.559 --> 04:05.060
- What happened?
- I'm fine.

04:05.269 --> 04:07.690
Probable shoulder dislocation.

04:07.899 --> 04:11.111
- Where's Kevin?
- I'll go find him.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.406
- Sure you're all right?
- What a morning!

04:13.948 --> 04:16.577
Trauma panel, type and cross for four.

04:16.744 --> 04:19.164
Deep lacerations to the chest.

04:19.373 --> 04:22.210
- Decreased breath on the left.
- BP's 100/60.

04:22.419 --> 04:24.881
- Help me!
- What's your name?

04:25.214 --> 04:28.385
Screw that! I want to speak
to the manager!

04:28.551 --> 04:33.476
- You wanted the trauma fellowship?
- Careful what you wish for.

04:33.684 --> 04:36.062
- Forget your trauma gown?
- Later.

04:36.229 --> 04:40.735
- Pulse ox 92 on four liters.
- You on any medications?

04:40.943 --> 04:44.741
You sons of bitches! Give me
something for the pain!

04:44.949 --> 04:47.995
- Titrate four of M.S.
- You win. Morphine.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.667
I've seen you somewhere.
The coffee shop.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.421
And before that, the El train.

04:54.754 --> 04:55.797
You work here?

04:55.964 --> 04:57.884
- She's the manager.
- Oh, man!

04:58.092 --> 04:59.887
- Thora-Seal's ready.
- Hook me up!

05:00.095 --> 05:03.183
- First crit 35.
- Pressure's 70. Tachy at 130.

05:03.392 --> 05:05.603
He's bleeding out. 1000 cc's-

05:05.770 --> 05:09.192
Rapid infuse the blood.
Give him what he's lost.

05:09.441 --> 05:13.071
Dr. Corday took a critical.
I've got a ton of lacerations.

05:13.280 --> 05:18.119
Close us to trauma. Tell the patients
we'll get to them soon.

05:18.495 --> 05:20.790
The Rollerblade girl's in pain.

05:20.999 --> 05:24.629
- Four of morphine, one of Versed.
- The moonlighting doc?

05:24.795 --> 05:28.409
Dr. Kovac? Check the board
for when he's due.

05:28.418 --> 05:30.429
- Who's this
- The driver of the truck.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.140
Call transport. Get him to the morgue.

05:32.307 --> 05:35.727
Are you a doctor?
I got one mother of a migraine.

05:35.935 --> 05:37.521
We'll get to you soon.

05:37.731 --> 05:42.612
I put a Compazine suppository
up my ass. It ain't working.

05:42.820 --> 05:46.284
- Someone will be with you soon.
- They said that 20 minutes ago!

05:46.743 --> 05:49.663
- Really, they will.
- Dr. Weaver? Phone.

05:52.835 --> 05:54.921
Can you take it from here?

05:55.129 --> 05:58.176
- We're just waiting on an O.R.
- Carol?

05:59.259 --> 06:01.889
You have to find my daughter.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.351
I don't know where she is.

06:04.517 --> 06:07.938
- What's her name? I'll look for her.
- Michelle Kinney.

06:08.147 --> 06:10.693
- Better get that checked out.
- I'll take a look.

06:10.859 --> 06:13.405
- It's okay.
- We'll look for her.

06:13.614 --> 06:17.869
- Tell me where it hurts.
- My chest. I can't breathe.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.873
- Any pain here?
- No. Not really.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.169
- Pulse ox 88.
- Poor tidal volume. I'll intubate.

06:24.378 --> 06:25.897
Four of Versed, 100 of sux.

06:25.898 --> 06:28.217
We'll give you medicine.

06:28.425 --> 06:32.305
When you wake up, a tube
will help you breathe.

06:32.514 --> 06:35.393
Get X-ray. And I need an ultrasound.

06:36.144 --> 06:39.982
Dr. Corday?
This man's here to see you.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.362
Charles Cameron from Rush.
We were gonna have coffee.

06:43.571 --> 06:47.911
- I'm sorry. I'm a bit involved.
- Mind if I hang out?

06:48.078 --> 06:52.166
That'd be fine.
Dr. Cameron, Dr. Mark Greene.

06:54.377 --> 06:58.382
Let me just check this page.
I'll be right back.

07:00.761 --> 07:05.351
I forgot we'd set up a coffee
for an interview at Rush.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.063
- An interview for...?
- Cardiothoracic.

07:08.522 --> 07:10.796
That's sewn up with Romano.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.070
That's it: the prospect of Romano.

07:13.278 --> 07:18.202
- I want to check other opportunities.
- Probably is a good idea.

07:18.786 --> 07:22.291
- I thought I told you.
- You don't have to tell me everything.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.046
- I'm looking for a little girl.
- Not here.

07:26.255 --> 07:28.884
- Got a Rollerblader.
- Is he all right?

07:29.093 --> 07:32.388
- We may take him to the O.R.
- I'll tell the girlfriend.

07:32.805 --> 07:35.642
The phone's for you.
Revisions on the Jayco report?

07:35.851 --> 07:38.438
They call in the middle of a trauma.

07:38.647 --> 07:41.984
The mind-numbing day-to-day detritus
of this job.

07:42.151 --> 07:44.738
- You okay finishing the DPL?
- Yeah.

07:46.324 --> 07:48.661
- Gonna ask him?
- Ask him what?

07:48.869 --> 07:51.956
- It's rumored he's quitting.
- What?

07:52.166 --> 07:55.420
- Going back to general surgery.
- I've heard nothing.

07:55.629 --> 07:59.300
- Residents are out of the loop.
- Why would he do that?

07:59.509 --> 08:02.304
The day-to-day "whatever" of his job.

08:02.513 --> 08:05.475
How are we doing? Prep for transfer.

08:05.683 --> 08:08.145
How tough is it to get a painkiller?

08:08.146 --> 08:10.607
Sorry, we got a lot
of critical cases right now.

08:10.816 --> 08:15.489
And my head ain't critical?
What kind of joint is this?!

08:15.865 --> 08:18.661
- Kill the migraine guy?
- Happily.

08:18.869 --> 08:22.207
Did a little girl come in
with this accident?

08:22.415 --> 08:25.211
- I didn't see her.
- She may be on her way.

08:25.378 --> 08:27.339
MICN's sending two more criticals.

08:27.547 --> 08:30.009
I told you to close us to trauma.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.471
I know, but Dr Romano said keep us open.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.143
- Who asked him?
- It's protocol. He's acting chief.

08:36.352 --> 08:39.563
Have them go to Mercy.
And call Romano.

08:39.731 --> 08:43.236
What the hell is he thinking. We're barely
keeping our head above water as it is.

08:43.402 --> 08:47.116
- Pressure's down to 75.
- No belly bleeding.

08:47.325 --> 08:49.978
X - ray shows diffuse bilateral
pulmonary contusions.

08:50.013 --> 08:51.539
No sense of blood loss.

08:51.747 --> 08:53.978
Pulse ox down to 80 on 100% oxygen.

08:54.413 --> 08:55.911
Let me check the heart.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.676
May be a tension pneumo.
14-gauge needle, open syringe.

09:00.093 --> 09:02.500
- Crit's 42.
- No pericardial effusion.

09:05.966 --> 09:07.397
No tension pneumo.

09:07.452 --> 09:10.272
But a terrible ejection fraction.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.820
- Cardiac contusion?
- Heart and lungs are bruised.

09:14.028 --> 09:17.367
- Another five of PEEP.
- Pressure's at 60.

09:17.575 --> 09:19.577
- Mix up dopamine.
- Should I book an O.R.?

09:19.786 --> 09:21.204
Nothing to repair surgically.

09:21.371 --> 09:23.958
- Right you are, unfortunately.
- What do we do?

09:24.459 --> 09:26.711
Pressure and ventilatory support.

09:26.921 --> 09:31.594
Let's try something.
Get a bypass machine from the O.R.

09:31.886 --> 09:34.807
Prepare the groin
for bypass catheters.

09:34.974 --> 09:38.645
- Bypass? That's gutsy.
- It's worth a try.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.984
- Betadine and sterile drapes.
- This is quite a convention.

09:43.151 --> 09:48.117
Charlie Cameron from Rush.
Haven't seen you in... Who cares?

09:48.325 --> 09:51.037
What brings you to our fair land?

09:51.664 --> 09:54.960
Coffee. I hear it's the best
in the city.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.590
There's enough cooks in this broth.

09:58.798 --> 10:02.261
I'll go and inspire
the rest of the troops.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.889
- O.R.'s ready.
- Pulse ox 99 on 100%.

10:05.098 --> 10:07.269
- What's going on?
- Penetrating chest trauma.

10:07.477 --> 10:10.147
1000 cc's out of the chest.

10:10.356 --> 10:12.359
- His pressure?
-95, up from 70.

10:12.526 --> 10:15.196
Keep him here. Check another pressure.

10:15.363 --> 10:20.035
He needs a thoracotomy. His chest tube
output indicates the O.R.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.922
Borderline. How much blood?

10:21.930 --> 10:25.961
- O-neg, 1000 cc's.
- What's in the Thora-Seal?

10:26.303 --> 10:28.380
-100 cc's.
- And the pressure?

10:28.588 --> 10:32.151
- 105/74.
- Peter, let's review.

10:32.186 --> 10:35.858
His pressure's normal and
chest tube output's a trickle.

10:36.025 --> 10:40.021
As a surgeon, I'd say he's forming a clot.
Would you disagree?

10:40.188 --> 10:41.232
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

10:41.440 --> 10:46.405
If we're gonna open a kid's chest,
with the risks and months of pain...

10:46.906 --> 10:50.244
...let's not have "maybe"
as part of the equation.

11:04.179 --> 11:05.891
What's your name?

11:06.516 --> 11:09.854
My name's Luka.
It's a funny name, isn't it?

11:10.772 --> 11:13.526
Can you say it? Luka.

11:15.946 --> 11:17.739
Does your arm hurt?

11:20.286 --> 11:22.037
I'm a doctor.

11:22.998 --> 11:24.374
I want my mom.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.586
I can help you.

11:28.964 --> 11:31.050
You want to come out now?

11:33.010 --> 11:36.474
In that case, do you mind
if I come in?

11:40.438 --> 11:43.984
Of course. I'd be happy to mentor you.

11:44.151 --> 11:46.209
I'm dying here! Any of you putzes care?

11:46.251 --> 11:48.950
I want to focus on emergency medicine.

11:49.158 --> 11:51.309
It's great to have a person to go to.

11:51.395 --> 11:53.831
I know. I had a great mentor.

11:53.999 --> 11:56.836
Do I gotta get run over by a truck?

11:57.044 --> 11:59.840
- I sent the head trauma to CT.
- Thank you.

12:00.048 --> 12:03.344
Have you heard rumors
about Anspaugh quitting?

12:03.512 --> 12:05.848
- No.
- I heard a scarier one.

12:06.014 --> 12:10.855
He's quitting and Dr. Romano's
the front-runner for the job.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.316
Romano as chief of staff?

12:13.483 --> 12:16.779
- Carter, take this sheet.
- You okay?

12:17.029 --> 12:19.867
Stand by with paddles.
Ready for chest compressions.

12:20.034 --> 12:21.537
I'm in. Hook this up.

12:21.745 --> 12:24.875
- We need to speak when you can.
- Sure.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.795
- Run of nine.
- Charge to 200.

12:29.046 --> 12:30.549
Start the bypass.

12:49.658 --> 12:53.414
- She's stabilizing.
- Want to go in here?

12:53.622 --> 12:56.626
- Wean off the dopamine.
- BP 120/80.

12:56.835 --> 13:00.923
I hear Anspaugh's stepping down
and Romano's next in line.

13:01.132 --> 13:03.552
No, Anspaugh would've told us.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.598
Probably crazy rumor-mill stuff.

13:06.765 --> 13:10.228
- I'll go talk to him about it.
- Good idea.

13:10.437 --> 13:13.734
- It's the fire alarm!
- Tell me it's a drill!

13:13.942 --> 13:17.363
- Prep your patient for transfer.
- I'll cover the hall!

13:17.571 --> 13:19.199
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.118
Move patients to the ambulance bay.

13:21.285 --> 13:22.954
- We moving?
- Maybe. Be ready.

13:23.122 --> 13:24.957
Dr. Benton, he's crashing!

13:24.992 --> 13:26.792
Carter! Get in here now!

13:27.126 --> 13:29.713
- He's in fib!
- Paddles! Charge to 200.

13:29.921 --> 13:32.885
Another 1500 in the Thora-Seal.

13:33.093 --> 13:35.972
Thoracotomy tray! Let's move!

13:36.180 --> 13:39.018
Scalpel. Let's squeeze in the blood.

13:39.226 --> 13:42.690
- Should I page Romano?
- No time. Rib spreader.

13:46.820 --> 13:50.450
- There's a gallon of blood in here.
- More suction!

13:51.995 --> 13:53.621
Please don't run.

13:53.830 --> 13:57.334
Everybody move slowly
to the ambulance bay.

13:57.502 --> 13:59.078
Three's clear. Where's the fire?

13:59.175 --> 14:00.930
I don't know. You put exam 1 and 2?

14:00.965 --> 14:04.770
- I got four units of type-specific.
- Hang it now.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.891
Take over internal compressions.

14:08.099 --> 14:12.857
- What about the fire alarm?
- Let's save his life first.

14:13.356 --> 14:16.277
- There's the bleeder.
-2-0 Vicryl and pickups.

14:16.485 --> 14:19.866
- You want FFP?
- Two units and a gram of Ancef.

14:20.074 --> 14:23.705
Still in fib. Good femoral pulse
with compressions.

14:23.913 --> 14:25.665
Mammary artery is ligated.

14:25.874 --> 14:30.005
All right, paddles. Charge to 20.
Everybody clear!

14:32.341 --> 14:36.181
- You pulled it?
- Maybe now I'll get some attention.

14:36.389 --> 14:38.871
He pulled the damn alarm!

14:38.872 --> 14:41.353
Let people know it's a false alarm.

14:41.605 --> 14:44.817
Stay down! You move,
I'll let her at you.

14:45.026 --> 14:48.780
It's a false alarm!
You don't have to evacuate!

14:48.989 --> 14:50.992
There is no fire!

14:58.586 --> 15:01.173
- Normal sinus.
- BP's 80 systolic.

15:01.381 --> 15:05.762
- His oxygen tank's almost empty.
- Get another cylinder.

15:05.928 --> 15:10.059
All right, let's get him up.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.982
- Go, people! Go!
- Watch it!

15:31.298 --> 15:34.469
- Have you ever been to the circus?
- No.

15:34.636 --> 15:36.304
You have now.

15:40.810 --> 15:45.192
- You just break the valve?
- You can rent it, take it to a party.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.490
Find Mr. Migraine. Give him
six mg of Imitrex.

15:49.697 --> 15:52.701
Report him to the police
for inciting a riot.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.622
Which room's open?

15:54.830 --> 15:58.877
Thanks, but our pediatric resident
can take her.

15:59.085 --> 16:01.173
- Cleo's not on.
- She's due shortly.

16:01.339 --> 16:03.717
- Put her in Pedes.
- She wants her mother.

16:03.927 --> 16:08.349
Not a good idea. She's been
intubated and is on bypass.

16:08.557 --> 16:13.522
- Plenty of patients need suturing.
- Sure. I'll check the board.

16:13.689 --> 16:15.317
I'll find Anspaugh.

16:15.525 --> 16:17.080
The Rollerblader's films are back.

16:17.115 --> 16:18.862
Let's go take a look.

16:19.030 --> 16:22.701
One last critical in.
They were found under the rubble.

16:22.868 --> 16:26.373
- At the back door.
- Lucy, follow me on this.

16:26.540 --> 16:30.046
- Got another lac for Dr. Kovac.
- Got it.

16:32.799 --> 16:35.803
I'll give you articles
and go over them.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.388
- Great.
- Morning.

16:37.555 --> 16:41.519
I'm glad you're here.
I've got a Pedes case for you.

16:41.728 --> 16:45.066
- Sounds good.
- Do you always jog to work?

16:45.274 --> 16:48.987
- It's only four miles.
- Makes me want to dislike her.

16:49.364 --> 16:54.286
This tube gives your mother
medicine to make her better.

16:54.996 --> 16:56.748
And what's that?

16:56.956 --> 17:01.839
That's a machine that helps her
take real deep breaths.

17:02.423 --> 17:06.845
Like when you swim underwater,
you take deep breaths.

17:07.180 --> 17:10.935
I'm not allowed to go underwater.
I wear wings.

17:11.144 --> 17:15.147
- Wings?
- Kind of a life jacket for little kids.

17:16.317 --> 17:19.614
My mommy's medicine makes her sleepy.

17:19.781 --> 17:23.367
She'll wake up soon
and be very happy to see you.

17:24.871 --> 17:29.627
Now we'll go find the doctor
who will look at your arm.

17:30.670 --> 17:34.635
Peter, I am impressed. Ten minutes
in on your teenager...

17:34.842 --> 17:38.138
...and you haven't said,
"I told you so. "

17:38.305 --> 17:43.188
-36 French for the second chest tube.
- Another liter of irrigant.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.817
You've met Charles Cameron?
From Rush?

17:46.984 --> 17:51.074
He has privileges here.
Cardiothoracic, I think.

17:51.282 --> 17:55.329
That's the same specialty
that Dr. Corday...

17:55.537 --> 17:58.500
...is still interested in, isn't it?

18:00.002 --> 18:01.613
I wouldn't know.

18:01.844 --> 18:04.675
Hasn't mentioned it lately, huh?

18:04.884 --> 18:07.763
- Not to me.
- Not to me either.

18:07.971 --> 18:11.184
Bizarre, considering I sponsored her.
Why is that?

18:11.392 --> 18:15.816
I know you two are friends.
You know her better than I do.

18:16.024 --> 18:20.948
Do all our conversations have to
revolve around Elizabeth?

18:25.913 --> 18:31.462
Perhaps we don't need to have
further conversations at all.

18:34.716 --> 18:38.305
Some number two Dexon.
for the intercostal.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.061
And I will close.

18:41.684 --> 18:43.437
Is this the last one?

18:43.646 --> 18:46.733
Ruptured her aorta.
Bled out in seconds.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.235
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

18:48.401 --> 18:51.322
Good work.
Write the death note?

18:51.532 --> 18:53.451
I'll get the death kit.

18:54.118 --> 18:57.498
I talked to Anspaugh.
The rumors are true.

18:58.123 --> 19:01.254
Both of them?
Romano will be chief of staff?

19:01.420 --> 19:05.467
Donald's staying at County
to do general surgery.

19:05.676 --> 19:08.638
He wants to spend more time
with his daughter.

19:08.805 --> 19:11.558
Romano's a possibility.

19:11.767 --> 19:15.564
- We gotta do something.
- Anspaugh will meet with us.

19:15.773 --> 19:20.696
- We'll tell him what we think.
- He's not the right one for us.

19:21.030 --> 19:25.829
I don't get it. You're a regular
doctor, but you don't work here?

19:26.037 --> 19:29.458
I do work here,
but only when they need me.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.295
I'm what they call a "moonlighter. "

19:32.797 --> 19:34.466
Because you're from another country?

19:34.674 --> 19:39.640
No, because I only work here from time
to time, when they need me.

19:39.807 --> 19:43.144
They needed you today
for the truck crash.

19:44.062 --> 19:48.735
No. I'm here because one of
the regular doctors-

19:48.944 --> 19:52.323
You said you were a regular doctor.

19:52.490 --> 19:56.496
I fill in when someone's absent.

19:56.704 --> 19:58.749
I get it. You're like a sub.

20:00.377 --> 20:01.837
A sub.

20:02.128 --> 20:04.715
Yeah, yeah. I'm a sub.

20:04.924 --> 20:07.010
What kind of accent is that?

20:07.594 --> 20:09.013
Thick.

20:09.931 --> 20:13.185
Neighbors heard the baby cry.
Called the police.

20:13.352 --> 20:14.688
Broke the door down.

20:14.854 --> 20:18.026
- Any relatives?
- They don't think so.

20:18.193 --> 20:20.195
- Said she has AIDS.
- And the baby?

20:20.404 --> 20:23.409
- Don't know. Anything else?
- We've got it.

20:23.617 --> 20:26.735
Tachycardia, pulse thready, hypoxic,

20:26.770 --> 20:28.540
possible fulminant pneumocystis.

20:28.748 --> 20:33.380
Start her on Bactrim, three amps IV,
125 mgs of Solu-Medrol.

20:33.547 --> 20:36.217
Crank the O-2 up to 10 liters.

20:36.425 --> 20:39.805
- You want a CBC and lytes?
- Have ICU get a bed.

20:40.014 --> 20:42.058
- How's that baby?
- Temp's 102.

20:42.225 --> 20:45.062
He's dehydrated. I started an IV.

20:45.271 --> 20:48.442
Rales consolidating on the right.

20:48.651 --> 20:50.904
Take a blood count and a chest film.

20:51.113 --> 20:52.991
- I'll get it.
- Pneumonia?

20:53.283 --> 20:55.995
- Pretty safe bet.
- Want an HIV test?

20:56.578 --> 21:00.418
We need the mom's permission.
That won't happen.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.170
Likely he's positive.

21:02.378 --> 21:05.133
The mom or the court
has to allow the test.

21:05.340 --> 21:07.761
We'll start him on Cefurox.

21:07.928 --> 21:11.223
HIV-positive,
goes ahead and has a baby.

21:11.432 --> 21:14.144
No support.
What was she thinking?

21:14.353 --> 21:18.108
Films are back on the girl
with the broken arm.

21:18.276 --> 21:21.071
- I'll fill out the labs.
- Thanks.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.784
- Can you get these to the lab?
- Sure.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.662
Thanks.

21:26.870 --> 21:31.252
Wait a second, I forgot.
Add an HIV test to this one.

21:31.460 --> 21:32.962
- Carlos Ortega?
- Right.

21:33.129 --> 21:34.463
No problem.

21:40.806 --> 21:44.854
- Am I interrupting?
- Not at all. We are done here.

21:45.062 --> 21:49.359
Vanilla Latte. I wondered about you.
Glad you're okay.

21:50.111 --> 21:53.615
- You're the warm-milk lady.
- Right. I work here.

21:53.824 --> 21:57.746
- But do you really work here?
- Don't answer that.

21:57.954 --> 22:00.833
- You're done. Feel okay?
- I feel fine.

22:01.042 --> 22:03.879
- On your way.
- Thanks.

22:05.173 --> 22:08.970
Oh, my God! That boy is relentless.

22:09.179 --> 22:13.476
I think his parents feel
quite exhausted, huh?

22:13.685 --> 22:18.233
It seems like I need some stitches.
I already irrigated.

22:19.276 --> 22:22.697
You were at the coffee place
when it happened?

22:22.865 --> 22:27.453
I had just left. I don't
even want to think about it.

22:28.204 --> 22:32.545
It seems most people came out
okay. Miraculously.

22:32.961 --> 22:36.883
You took that little girl in
to see her mother?

22:37.718 --> 22:41.390
Dr. Weaver and Dr. Greene thought
it was a bad idea.

22:42.308 --> 22:45.395
They're not sure if I'm
a good doctor.

22:45.603 --> 22:49.317
But it's the second or third time
you've worked here.

22:49.526 --> 22:54.408
Enough time for them to stop
calling me Dr. Kovac.

22:54.616 --> 22:59.581
When people are not sure, they tend
to keep things more formal.

22:59.747 --> 23:03.545
I hope after I suture you
you'll call me Luka.

23:05.965 --> 23:09.261
Children need to know, need to see.

23:09.428 --> 23:13.851
Even if it's not good, it's
better than being in the dark.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.771
Having that kind of fear...

23:17.815 --> 23:19.942
You sound experienced.

23:21.236 --> 23:26.034
My experience with children
didn't help me with that boy.

23:30.124 --> 23:33.253
- Are you busy?
- No, I just got sutured.

23:33.462 --> 23:37.300
Their mother was in that accident.
Massive trauma.

23:37.508 --> 23:40.220
- They want to view the body.
- No problem.

23:41.431 --> 23:45.604
I'm Carol Hathaway.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

23:45.770 --> 23:46.813
Thank you.

23:47.022 --> 23:50.067
- Shall I show you in?
- Yes, please.

24:17.564 --> 24:19.753
I hear Romano's to be chief of staff.

24:19.788 --> 24:21.277
You gonna fight this?

24:21.485 --> 24:23.990
Dr. Weaver and I
will see Dr. Anspaugh.

24:24.197 --> 24:27.201
- We'll give our honest opinions.
- You'll fight it. Good.

24:27.368 --> 24:30.247
That baby needs to get up to Pedes.

24:30.456 --> 24:32.752
I'll go. The mom's in the ICU.

24:32.959 --> 24:35.005
- I'll call you.
- Great.

24:36.339 --> 24:37.884
Long cup of coffee.

24:38.050 --> 24:41.430
- He got paged. He left and came back.
- How'd it go?

24:41.638 --> 24:45.018
Who ever knows with interviews?
I'm late for a lap choly.

24:45.226 --> 24:48.690
- I'll take that back pain in 4.
- Sure. You need some help?

24:48.899 --> 24:51.067
I'm okay. Thanks anyway.

24:51.235 --> 24:56.199
I don't mean to pry. How are things
with you and Elizabeth?

24:56.408 --> 24:59.162
- You're still going out?
- A little.

24:59.371 --> 25:03.376
- Must I beg for information?
- I'd hate to see that.

25:03.586 --> 25:07.800
Everything's okay.
I may have backed off a bit.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.719
So she's backed off.

25:09.927 --> 25:14.559
These things just have a life
of their own, don't they?

25:14.768 --> 25:16.978
If that's not enough, beg.

25:18.272 --> 25:21.819
MVA, BMW vs. Toyota. Stable.
Some neck pain.

25:22.028 --> 25:25.574
She didn't want to come here,
but she's polite about it.

25:25.782 --> 25:28.287
- MVA?
- Motor vehicle accident.

25:28.494 --> 25:32.207
It was a little fender-bender.
I'm completely fine.

25:32.417 --> 25:34.711
- Elaine Nichols?
- Yes.

25:35.087 --> 25:36.422
I'm John Carter.

25:37.966 --> 25:39.594
Douglas' cousin.

25:39.969 --> 25:41.804
Yes, of course.

25:42.473 --> 25:45.143
We're nearly related.
Can I get out of this thing?

25:45.352 --> 25:46.686
Sure.

25:46.978 --> 25:50.734
You'll have to hold still
while I examine you.

25:50.942 --> 25:54.280
Can't believe you're old enough
to be a doctor.

25:54.290 --> 25:56.475
No midline tenderness?

25:56.583 --> 25:59.997
Turn your head to the right.
To the left.

26:00.106 --> 26:02.152
Full range of motion. You're clear.

26:02.522 --> 26:04.536
Can I get up?

26:08.258 --> 26:11.888
- Is that better?
- I guess you are old enough.

26:14.224 --> 26:17.688
- So no neck pain?
- My little finger, actually.

26:17.897 --> 26:20.776
I jammed it when I got on the gurney.

26:20.983 --> 26:23.196
Let's check them all out.

26:29.454 --> 26:33.792
- Hand x-ray? I'll go order it.
- Thank you, Chuny.

26:34.669 --> 26:37.048
We'll make sure it's not fractured.

26:37.215 --> 26:40.010
I guess I'll be here for a while.

26:40.969 --> 26:42.555
If that's all right.

26:45.016 --> 26:48.563
I can't really think
how long it's been.

26:49.774 --> 26:54.739
Let's see, I divorced your cousin
Douglas three years ago.

26:54.906 --> 26:57.993
- I remember your wedding.
- You were there?

27:00.246 --> 27:03.667
Douglas looked nervous as hell.
You looked incredible-

27:03.876 --> 27:05.377
-ly calm.

27:08.633 --> 27:13.473
That was the calm before the storm,
given how our marriage went.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.227
Ancient history.

27:19.231 --> 27:20.858
But...

27:21.901 --> 27:23.612
...divorce suits me.

27:24.363 --> 27:28.201
So I assume you drive the BMW,
not the Toyota.

27:28.409 --> 27:30.371
What makes you think that?

27:34.877 --> 27:37.672
- X-ray confirms pneumonia.
- Pneumocystis?

27:37.881 --> 27:41.637
- Looks more bacterial.
- Is this the Ortega baby?

27:41.845 --> 27:43.597
I'm Jeanie Boulet.

27:43.806 --> 27:46.977
Robert Martin, DCFS.
How long will he be here?

27:47.186 --> 27:49.063
At least a few days.

27:49.271 --> 27:52.485
The longer the better.
More time to place him.

27:52.652 --> 27:56.950
- Any ideas where?
- No. Cases like this are a mess.

27:57.158 --> 28:00.620
Dying mother with AIDS.
Probably have to go to court.

28:00.829 --> 28:01.955
If he's positive?

28:02.874 --> 28:08.307
Families willing to take on a child of
color with HIV? Not a dime a dozen.

28:15.467 --> 28:16.278
You're late.

28:16.430 --> 28:19.188
I'm with Family Counseling Services.

28:19.396 --> 28:22.234
- How you doing?
- Fine, but you're late.

28:22.442 --> 28:23.986
I'll get right to it.

28:24.195 --> 28:26.697
This, as you know, is a mediation.

28:26.907 --> 28:30.871
We want an agreement
regarding your son's custody.

28:31.038 --> 28:33.540
I'm not a judge. This is confidential.

28:33.708 --> 28:36.879
Nothing said here can be
used in court.

28:37.088 --> 28:39.048
Why can't we go to court?

28:39.257 --> 28:42.637
Because this is a court-ordered
mediation.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.684
Because you got a restraining order
on me and Roger.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.939
Just on your taking him to Germany...

28:50.147 --> 28:53.276
...where he can't develop
language skills.

28:53.485 --> 28:56.072
- My son's deaf.
- Our son. He knows.

28:56.239 --> 29:00.954
Reece will be fine with an
American sign language tutor.

29:01.163 --> 29:02.915
- You have a tutor?
- I will!

29:03.165 --> 29:05.084
And what if you don't?

29:05.543 --> 29:09.006
We're here to talk about
your child's needs.

29:09.215 --> 29:12.929
- He needs to be with his mother.
- And father.

29:13.096 --> 29:18.061
You gonna put him to bed on the sofa
in your living room?

29:18.436 --> 29:21.273
- He doesn't have his own room?
- Of course he does.

29:21.565 --> 29:23.025
Since when?

29:23.276 --> 29:28.241
We moved in with my sister Jackie
and her family...

29:28.491 --> 29:33.415
...so Reece could have much more
of a complete family unit.

29:33.707 --> 29:35.292
As he would with us.

29:37.254 --> 29:41.802
- His black mother and black stepfather.
- What's that mean?

29:42.010 --> 29:44.138
So I went out with a white woman?

29:47.894 --> 29:50.564
- I'm just saying-
- I can't do this.

29:50.773 --> 29:54.318
Yes, you can.
Court-ordered, remember?

30:00.369 --> 30:03.832
- What's the prognosis?
- Why are you in here?

30:04.165 --> 30:07.420
You said to wait in Chairs,
so I found one.

30:08.004 --> 30:11.635
- I didn't even know we had a chair.
- Is that me?

30:23.192 --> 30:26.530
Not much of a measure of a hand,
is it?

30:28.241 --> 30:30.869
I mean, of what a hand can do.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.419
- Looks too spindly.
- There's no fracture.

30:36.627 --> 30:40.174
That's good. So I'm free to go?

30:40.383 --> 30:42.135
I'll walk you out.

30:42.552 --> 30:44.304
Do you need a ride?

30:44.513 --> 30:48.561
I'll be taking cabs
until my car gets fixed.

30:48.727 --> 30:51.731
I hoped for something more dramatic.

30:51.940 --> 30:56.571
A cast or a sling to get me
out of this fundraiser tonight.

30:56.738 --> 31:00.243
- Don't tell me.
- The Carter Family Foundation.

31:00.410 --> 31:04.082
Even in divorce,
Gamma has her claws into you?

31:04.874 --> 31:09.589
- Why aren't you at these functions?
- I got myself declawed.

31:09.798 --> 31:13.511
What is it? Save The Lake?
Children's Library?

31:13.719 --> 31:15.514
Children's Art League.

31:15.723 --> 31:17.627
Can you call a cab for Miss Nichols?

31:17.662 --> 31:19.519
Sure.

31:19.727 --> 31:23.108
- Thank you, Dr. Carter.
- You are welcome.

31:23.275 --> 31:26.112
- I'll be thinking of you.
- You will?

31:26.279 --> 31:30.618
Tonight, mixing it up with
the rest of the Carters.

31:30.827 --> 31:33.665
Then I'll have to think of you.

31:34.958 --> 31:38.129
- It was nice to see you again.
- John.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.136
Think Anspaugh's decided?

31:43.344 --> 31:46.890
If so many oppose Romano,
how can he appoint him?

31:47.099 --> 31:48.434
Will there be enough?

31:48.643 --> 31:51.647
- What if it's just you and me?
- Don't think about it.

31:52.231 --> 31:55.193
He's eager, if not
downright breathless.

31:55.402 --> 31:57.989
I'm not compelled to oppose him.

31:58.197 --> 32:00.994
As head of Radiology,
I'll point out...

32:01.327 --> 32:06.250
...that no Radiology head's ever
considered for chief of staff.

32:06.459 --> 32:08.422
But perhaps that's a topic for some
other day.

32:08.519 --> 32:10.611
I see why we wait so long for x-rays.

32:10.612 --> 32:12.351
Thank you. Carl?

32:12.359 --> 32:14.887
Up in Psych we run our own ship.

32:15.096 --> 32:18.767
Took six months to hear
Donald had taken over.

32:18.977 --> 32:22.481
It won't rock my world.
Romano's fine with me.

32:23.649 --> 32:26.695
- How about you, Jack?
- I'm like you.

32:26.903 --> 32:31.870
I've had enough bureaucratic crap.
I already had one heart attack.

32:32.036 --> 32:35.164
I say, book the guy willing
to take it on.

32:43.260 --> 32:46.014
I hate to be the voice of dissent.

32:46.222 --> 32:48.892
And it certainly isn't personal.

32:49.060 --> 32:52.481
- I feel I should be honest.
- Absolutely.

32:54.400 --> 32:58.990
As acting chief of the ER
for the past few months...

32:59.198 --> 33:00.951
...Dr. Romano has...

33:01.160 --> 33:04.622
There hasn't been a great deal
of support.

33:05.248 --> 33:07.960
His management style is...

33:08.920 --> 33:10.463
...I guess, abrupt.

33:10.672 --> 33:15.263
And several members
of our staff have...

33:16.179 --> 33:20.019
Well, they've even found it offensive.

33:21.271 --> 33:22.564
Go on.

33:25.526 --> 33:29.073
I guess I'd have to say
that I'd worry...

33:29.282 --> 33:33.079
...if Dr. Romano had
the responsibility...

33:33.288 --> 33:36.125
...of the entire staff and faculty.

33:39.545 --> 33:41.833
Thank you for your candor.

33:43.209 --> 33:44.720
Kerry?

33:46.848 --> 33:48.766
Anyone in management knows...

33:48.975 --> 33:52.298
...it's never easy
taking over another department.

33:52.572 --> 33:55.651
There have been bumps in the road.

33:55.910 --> 33:59.240
But I feel Dr. Romano has succeeded...

33:59.449 --> 34:02.369
...in stabilizing the situation...

34:02.578 --> 34:07.334
...and is now providing genuine
leadership in the ER.

34:07.585 --> 34:10.797
You'd support him as chief of staff?

34:11.005 --> 34:14.510
It's only fair we give him
all our support.

34:20.935 --> 34:23.188
- You hung me out to dry.
- I'm sorry.

34:23.397 --> 34:25.943
It was obvious he'd get the job.

34:26.275 --> 34:28.655
He'd take it out on the ER...

34:28.822 --> 34:31.659
...if I'd fought.
It was politically smart.

34:31.826 --> 34:35.581
You were smart while I was
stupid and honest.

34:35.789 --> 34:39.128
Stop! I'm only trying to protect
the department.

34:39.335 --> 34:41.380
You believe that? I don't.

34:41.589 --> 34:43.925
Don has the dullest meetings.

34:44.092 --> 34:46.721
No wonder we need a kick of java.

34:47.556 --> 34:49.391
So? What do you think?

34:50.435 --> 34:54.107
Got the Remington heave-ho.
New look, new job.

34:55.275 --> 35:00.198
Kerry, there's something I want
to discuss with you.

35:10.504 --> 35:13.508
- Are my glasses at your place?
- We can check later.

35:13.717 --> 35:17.556
- What else did he say?
- Carlos is hard to place.

35:17.723 --> 35:18.767
Because he's HIV-positive.

35:18.974 --> 35:21.978
I can't tell them.
I ordered the test illegally.

35:22.145 --> 35:25.149
- You'd think they'd want to know.
- I know.

35:26.026 --> 35:29.948
I'd be the perfect foster mom
for this baby.

35:30.157 --> 35:33.328
- I can deal with HIV.
- You'd be perfect.

35:33.660 --> 35:36.206
The DCFS wouldn't agree,
with my HIV status.

35:36.497 --> 35:38.001
You're healthier
than most people in the city.

35:38.209 --> 35:41.756
- Yeah, but I'm not married-
- Yet.

35:41.964 --> 35:46.011
There's no support for him if
something happens to me.

35:46.220 --> 35:47.890
- Yet.
- Reggie.

35:48.097 --> 35:50.246
We can take care of that right now.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.353
I gotta get back to work.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.857
Not until you agree to marry me.

35:55.191 --> 35:58.153
- You don't think I'm serious?
- You're crazy.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.790
Will you marry me?

36:11.880 --> 36:13.717
- Good job.
- What's this?

36:13.884 --> 36:16.011
- Your meeting with Anspaugh.
- How'd you know?

36:16.219 --> 36:18.681
- Nurses know everything.
- You fought the good fight. Thanks.

36:19.015 --> 36:22.562
- Lot of good it did us.
- Do you have a minute?

36:22.729 --> 36:26.609
- I was just heading out.
- I think that we should talk.

36:26.942 --> 36:30.448
- We've talked enough.
- It's something else.

36:32.575 --> 36:36.372
Pregnant 30-year-old,
T -boned passenger in MVA.

36:36.581 --> 36:39.668
No pulse in the field.
Traumatic full arrest.

36:39.878 --> 36:40.961
One, two, three.

36:41.171 --> 36:43.925
- She must be full-term.
- Take over CPR.

36:44.091 --> 36:47.304
I need an 8-0 tube.
Try to get suction.

36:47.512 --> 36:50.935
Set up a central line.
Four units O-neg.

36:51.143 --> 36:54.689
- Any fetal heart tones?
- Asystole on monitor.

36:54.899 --> 36:58.028
- Cricoid pressure.
- IV's blown.

36:58.235 --> 37:01.531
Give me an amp of epi
to put in the tube.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.912
- Blood's here.
- Hang it on the rapid infuser.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.791
- Fetal heart rate?
- Can't find it.

37:07.999 --> 37:10.336
- What's the mother's rhythm?
- Asytole.

37:10.544 --> 37:12.506
- Any pulse in the field?
- No.

37:12.715 --> 37:15.134
- Down time?
- We're at 12 minutes.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.929
- She's dead.
- Can't we-?

37:17.137 --> 37:19.181
We need to get the baby out now.

37:19.389 --> 37:23.354
Subclavian's in. Go with the O-neg.
Keep up compressions.

37:23.562 --> 37:26.191
- I need retractors.
- Get a baby warmer!

37:26.399 --> 37:29.696
- Cutdown tray.
- No time. Give me your hands.

37:32.408 --> 37:35.829
- Hold it open.
- Chest tube, 32 French.

37:35.996 --> 37:37.999
I'm opening the uterus.

37:38.834 --> 37:40.419
Bandage scissors.

37:41.337 --> 37:42.838
Bulb suction.

37:53.811 --> 37:54.980
It's a girl.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.529
Come here.

38:26.106 --> 38:29.152
Left chest is full of blood.
Hold compressions.

38:29.695 --> 38:32.616
- Still asystole.
- Let's rally here. One more try.

38:32.824 --> 38:35.828
Give me an amp of atropine.
Continue CPR.

38:36.412 --> 38:39.376
- Heart rate's 140.
- She's pinking up.

38:39.584 --> 38:42.797
One-minute Apgar, eight out of 10.

38:43.005 --> 38:45.759
- She's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

38:46.718 --> 38:50.224
Time of death, 18:48.

39:09.091 --> 39:10.514
How's he doing?

39:10.613 --> 39:14.131
Better. Fever's down. He's resting.

39:14.340 --> 39:17.052
Good. Any news on his mom?

39:17.469 --> 39:20.516
I didn't realize she has
end-stage AIDS.

39:26.065 --> 39:29.152
Let's start him on
the triple cocktail.

39:29.319 --> 39:32.490
- He hasn't even been tested.
- Start him.

39:39.082 --> 39:42.002
- Seen Dr. Greene?
- He left for the night.

39:42.169 --> 39:44.674
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

39:44.881 --> 39:47.344
I hear Romano will be chief.

39:47.511 --> 39:50.181
I haven't announced it yet...

39:50.348 --> 39:53.185
...but he made me chief of the ER.

39:53.352 --> 39:55.814
As they search for a permanent?

39:56.022 --> 40:00.862
- No. Actually, I am the permanent.
- Congratulations!

40:01.071 --> 40:03.908
- Thank you.
- Thanks for telling me.

40:04.117 --> 40:06.495
I think it's inappropriate...

40:06.703 --> 40:10.960
...to continue renting you
my basement apartment.

40:11.167 --> 40:15.466
Whoever's there should be
from outside the department.

40:15.675 --> 40:19.556
- You want me to move?
- Take your time. A week or two.

40:22.058 --> 40:24.061
Looking for something?

40:24.228 --> 40:27.399
No, just putting back this suture kit.

40:28.150 --> 40:30.737
You don't keep the opened ones...

40:30.904 --> 40:33.408
...but the scissors weren't used.

40:33.574 --> 40:36.745
Seems such a waste
to throw them away.

40:38.580 --> 40:41.126
- You okay?
- After that trauma?

40:41.334 --> 40:44.589
- Yeah. I feel pretty lucky.
- Good.

40:44.756 --> 40:48.261
Luka, whatever Greene
and Weaver think...

40:49.012 --> 40:50.722
You're a good doctor.

40:52.892 --> 40:54.103
Thank you.

41:06.953 --> 41:10.792
What was it you said?
"I'll be thinking of you tonight"?

41:11.292 --> 41:12.877
I guess I meant it.

41:14.631 --> 41:17.802
How do you like Jeeps?
It's not a BMW.

41:18.803 --> 41:22.141
It's also not a cab.
I like Jeeps.

41:22.474 --> 41:24.978
I thought maybe we'd get a drink.

41:25.813 --> 41:28.525
I don't really want a drink.

41:32.447 --> 41:36.661
Can I talk to you? I checked on
the anaphylactic shock.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.565
Her respiratory rate
and pulse are down.

41:39.632 --> 41:44.296
The hematuria's going to Medicine.
We can discharge the dermatitis.

41:44.305 --> 41:45.149
Excellent.

41:45.245 --> 41:48.845
Should I do any extra reading tonight?

41:49.053 --> 41:53.059
I'm afraid I can't continue
mentoring you.

41:53.268 --> 41:56.855
I've been appointed permanent
chief of ER.

41:57.356 --> 42:01.487
- That's good.
- It may seem like favoritism...

42:01.696 --> 42:04.700
...if I mentor one student
over another.

42:04.867 --> 42:06.911
Dr. Greene may have time.

42:07.120 --> 42:11.208
- Dr. Greene has a call.
- Take a message. He left.

42:11.375 --> 42:16.216
It's his father.
Dr. Greene's mother has died.

42:20.722 --> 42:22.974
Hello, can I help you?

42:34.574 --> 42:39.122
So this is how American males vent
anger and frustration?

42:39.623 --> 42:44.588
I figured a Romano/Weaver double
homicide was overkill.

42:46.591 --> 42:50.178
- How'd you find me?
- I have my sources.

42:51.431 --> 42:53.642
I heard about the meeting.

42:53.851 --> 42:56.479
I committed career suicide.

42:57.690 --> 43:00.527
Opened the door for Kerry
to be chief.

43:01.152 --> 43:04.197
Speaking up next to Romano
was courageous.

43:04.407 --> 43:07.119
I'm proud. You did the right thing.

43:08.663 --> 43:10.331
Thank you.

43:13.002 --> 43:16.966
Hitting the baseball doesn't
look that tough.

43:18.259 --> 43:21.805
- It doesn't, huh?
- You seem to be doing it.

43:22.432 --> 43:24.142
Want to give it a try?

43:25.477 --> 43:26.688
Come on.

43:29.191 --> 43:31.485
- All right.
- Like this?

43:32.738 --> 43:34.281
Nice!

43:35.575 --> 43:36.993
Smack it.

43:44.753 --> 43:47.507
- I'm okay!
- You have a good eye.

43:48.885 --> 43:52.275
Keep your eyes on the ball.
Here it comes. Very good.
