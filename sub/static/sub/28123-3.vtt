WEBVTT

00:59.993 --> 01:01.762
[RuPaul] Previously on
RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:01.762 --> 01:06.300
You'll be starring
in two breakthrough films.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.334
Action.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.370
[evil laugh]

01:10.370 --> 01:11.405
[laughs]

01:11.405 --> 01:12.906
Opulence.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.109
-You earn.
-[Michelle] Own.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.577
-You own
-You earn.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.713
-Own.
-Own.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.548
[RuPaul] Kahanna Montrese.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.617
I saw you trying really hard.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.486
I don't think
you got all the way there.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.654
[RuPaul] Mercedes Iman Diamond.

01:27.654 --> 01:28.889
[Michelle]
I feel amongst these girls

01:28.889 --> 01:31.124
that you get quiet
and I lose you.

01:31.124 --> 01:34.861
[RuPaul] Scarlett Envy
and Yvie Oddly,

01:34.861 --> 01:38.365
you are both the winners
of this week's challenge.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.801
Mercedes Iman Diamond,
shantay, you stay.

01:40.801 --> 01:41.835
Thank you.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.537
[RuPaul] Kahanna Montrese.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.504
Sashay away.

01:52.980 --> 01:56.550
-We made it.
-Oh, my God.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.518
Get me out of this.

01:58.518 --> 02:01.288
"Thank you
for making me feel loved.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.457
-XOXO." Oh, Kahanna.
-Aww.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.159
[Brooke] Kahanna was just
eliminated and it sucks,

02:06.159 --> 02:08.562
but this is like
the fucking plains of Africa.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.863
Eat or be eaten.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.266
Girl, being on the bottom two
is not the Tee,

02:13.266 --> 02:14.768
but girl, I was like,
uh-huh, I can't go home.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.503
I give everything for this.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.705
Mercedes wanted to stay.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.107
We got the message.

02:20.107 --> 02:23.877
But Mercedes needs to turn out
these challenges.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.312
She's a little bit introverted,

02:25.312 --> 02:27.714
and her looks are not
that strong, either.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.950
So it's like where are you
going to be strong at?

02:29.950 --> 02:31.418
You struggling
in all the categories.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.320
You gotta pick a struggle.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.055
You can't struggle
at everything, bitch.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.256
You'll go home.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.959
How about two winners
for the challenge?

02:38.959 --> 02:42.162
-Congratulations.
-Oooh!

02:42.162 --> 02:43.463
Yes girl.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.299
[Nina] This should have been
my challenge.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.467
I feel like I'm fading away.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.935
I need to like figure out

02:48.935 --> 02:51.338
how to be a star
in a roomful of stars.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.107
I delivered in the challenge.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.275
And I hope I send a message

02:55.275 --> 02:58.078
to anyone who maybe
is discounting me.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.012
[Vanjie laughs]

03:00.280 --> 03:01.715
You know.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.985
I was super-surprised how well
that Scarlet and Yvie did.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.153
I was a little bit jealous

03:06.153 --> 03:08.155
because I thought that
they were going to bomb.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.123
And then they killed it,
and I was like,

03:10.123 --> 03:13.160
great, 'cause
I certainly did not.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.394
I came in here
being like, oh, bitch,

03:14.394 --> 03:15.862
I'm gonna kill
these acting challenges.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.132
And for them to tell me,
like, oh, girl, it wasn't there,

03:19.132 --> 03:20.600
I'm like what the fuck?

03:20.600 --> 03:23.203
[Silky]
Ariel is a social media girl,

03:23.203 --> 03:24.805
so I think
it's a difference for her

03:24.805 --> 03:27.974
being in a situation where
she's with real entertainers.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.910
She's one note.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.978
She don't really have
a personality.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.780
She's an Instagram ho.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.116
Nobody care.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.417
NO-body care.

03:39.319 --> 03:40.520
[cries]

03:43.523 --> 03:44.958
[RuPaul] The winner

04:10.083 --> 04:12.586
It's a brand new day,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.987
A brand new day.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.455
I woke up this morning,

04:15.455 --> 04:17.958
there's one less ho,
and I feel great.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.693
[alarm]

04:19.693 --> 04:20.827
[RuPaul] Oh, girl!

04:20.827 --> 04:23.763
She done already
done had herses.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.967
My queens, whether you're
the preacher's wife

04:26.967 --> 04:29.202
or a freaking deacon,

04:29.202 --> 04:32.539
queenliness
is next to Godliness.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.174
Can I get an amen?

04:34.174 --> 04:35.942
[all] Amen!

04:35.942 --> 04:37.110
-Yaay.
-Ahhh.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.579
Hello, hello, hello.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.948
[cheers and applause]
- Hi!

04:41.948 --> 04:45.051
Ladies, picture this.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.587
The year is 1990,

04:47.587 --> 04:50.590
and I'm working
the backstage door

04:50.590 --> 04:53.026
after a sold out concert

04:53.026 --> 04:56.463
by the super-hot girl group
Seduction,

04:56.463 --> 04:58.932
featuring Michelle Visage.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.668
I wonder
whatever happened to her.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.637
[all laugh]

05:03.637 --> 05:05.972
So for today's mini challenge,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.275
you need to do and say

05:08.275 --> 05:11.845
whatever it takes
to sweet-talk your way in.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.581
In the end, the two queens

05:14.581 --> 05:18.451
with the funniest powers
of persuasion win.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.021
Now, you've got 15 minutes

05:21.021 --> 05:24.591
to get your all-access
VIP drags on.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.828
Go!

05:27.828 --> 05:30.063
Y'all, somebody please tuck me.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.065
Move, bitch, move.
[all laugh]

05:32.065 --> 05:33.200
Girl, these quick challenges

05:33.200 --> 05:34.634
are teaching me
the real meaning of beauty.

05:34.634 --> 05:37.103
[RuPaul] All right, ladies.
Time's up.

05:37.103 --> 05:41.107
[crowd cheering]

05:41.107 --> 05:42.943
[muffled dance music playing]

05:45.011 --> 05:46.980
[RuPaul] Who is it?
-Hi, there, hi, hi.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.516
This is Sue.
Sue from Northern Canada, eh.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.586
Um, I was hoping to get in
to see Michelle Visage.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.254
[RuPaul]
Is your name on the list?

05:54.254 --> 05:57.490
I'm here as a part of my women's
hockey team, the Moose Knuckles.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.993
[RuPaul] Well, I see
the Moose Knuckles.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.195
I got nine and a half reasons

06:02.195 --> 06:04.531
why Michelle Visage wants me
in this back door, baby.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.032
[RuPaul] Well, show me
at least one of them.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.101
I twerk, boo.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.236
[RuPaul]
There's a half reason.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.704
A half?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.205
[RuPaul] Are you sure
you're in the right place?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.807
Uh...

06:13.807 --> 06:15.742
-Uh!
-[laughs]

06:15.742 --> 06:17.177
[RuPaul] What's your name?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.345
Merckes.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.546
[RuPaul] How do you spell that?

06:19.546 --> 06:23.750
It's M-E-R-C-K-E-S.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.653
[RuPaul] Is that Mercedes?

06:26.653 --> 06:27.921
Yes.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.290
[RuPaul] Name three
Seduction songs.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.524
Okay...

06:31.524 --> 06:35.462
Seduction, Seduct,
and Selectivity.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.897
-[RuPaul laughs]
-Girl, what two things

06:37.897 --> 06:39.165
make a thing go right, girl?

06:39.165 --> 06:40.900
[RuPaul] You are loitering.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.335
Loitering?

06:42.335 --> 06:43.837
[RuPaul] Security.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.338
If you're such a good friend
of Michelle Visage,

06:45.338 --> 06:46.740
what's her middle name?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.342
You tell me her middle name
since you know so much about it.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.177
[RuPaul] Well, I'm all up
in the party.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.213
-You're the one--
-No, you're checking the door.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.981
[RuPaul] I... [laughs]

06:54.981 --> 06:56.349
You have a password?

06:56.349 --> 06:59.152
Tig old bitties, no?
[RuPaul] Wrong.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.553
Girl, let me in!

07:00.553 --> 07:02.589
Let me in.
It's your girl.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.591
[RuPaul] Let me see the ass.
Oh.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.625
[RuPaul] Ain't no ass there.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.727
Ain't no--look again.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.362
[RuPaul] Is that a rabbit coat?

07:09.362 --> 07:11.998
Yeah, yeah, it's my good fur.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.767
My good fur.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.768
[RuPaul] Access has been denied.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.869
What?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.337
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.173
Oh, my God, this is just like
tea and crumpets on Sundays.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.441
Yes.
[RuPaul] All right.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.609
Yeah? Yeah?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.778
I'm here
to have her sign my baby.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.213
[RuPaul]
Name five Seduction songs.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.616
There's that one
about two people.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.817
[RuPaul] Yeah,
you can't name them,

07:30.817 --> 07:32.585
and can't nobody else either.

07:32.585 --> 07:33.853
Um, I'm to understand

07:33.853 --> 07:36.823
one Michelle Visage
is performing here tonight.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.458
[RuPaul] You have credentials?

07:38.458 --> 07:41.561
It's a maternity test.
She's my mom.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.263
[RuPaul] You need
to move along, ma'am.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.231
You cannot come up in here.
I'm sorry.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.434
[crying]
Let me in please, miss.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.336
I would like to see my mom.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.937
[RuPaul laughs]

07:50.937 --> 07:52.739
I'm gonna have to call child
protective services on you.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.174
Oh, my God, mommy.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.975
[RuPaul] Or a dentist.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.446
[buzz buzz buzz]

07:59.446 --> 08:01.214
[RuPaul] Bitch, that ain't
gonna get you nowhere.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.683
I'm gonna football tackle
this door, honey.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.518
[RuPaul]
I'd like to see you try.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.187
Whoa-ho-ho!

08:07.187 --> 08:09.723
One, two, three.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.825
[RuPaul] Oh! [laughs]

08:11.825 --> 08:12.992
Whoo!

08:12.992 --> 08:14.094
[RuPaul] Do you hear that siren?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.229
Only thing I hear
is "Come in, Silky."

08:16.229 --> 08:19.165
Oh, you told me to come in.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.800
[RuPaul] Aah!
-I'm here, honey.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.202

total stalkers.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.675

08:28.675 --> 08:32.712
But two of you proved you've
got real schmooze control.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.122

08:46.826 --> 08:49.763
-Wow.
-Thank you. Thank you.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.565
Ladies, this week
we're celebrating something

08:52.565 --> 08:56.002
that drag queens
do better than anybody.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.638
Diva worship.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.007
For this week's maxi challenge,

09:01.007 --> 09:05.211

09:05.211 --> 09:07.113

about the divine pop diva
of your choice.

09:13.953 --> 09:14.921

09:47.921 --> 09:49.289
Come on, Miss Scarlet.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.523
I'm just here
for the communion.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.825
Miss Vanjie.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.426
Oh, jeez!

09:53.426 --> 09:55.295
[all laugh]

09:55.295 --> 09:56.296
Come on, Miss Plastique.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.997
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.633
Let's go with...

10:00.633 --> 10:03.203
Ahh...B-Brooke Lynn Hytes.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.171
God is good.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.774
-Come on, Honey.
-Yes, ma'am, praise Him.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.742
-Ariel Versace.
-Ooh.

10:09.742 --> 10:14.380
Now that leaves Mercedes
and A'Keria.

10:14.380 --> 10:18.318
Y'all left me standing
in the nosebleeds with Mercedes.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.020
All y'all have to blind,
crippled, and crazy.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.189
I'm not surprised that
A'Keria's still there.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.391
I haven't noticed A'Keria yet
in this competition.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.560
Her first look was amazing,

10:27.560 --> 10:30.230
but I really haven't seen
a lot of...

10:30.230 --> 10:32.232
oomph from her yet.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.566
The jury's still out
on A'Keria for me.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.336
Come on through, A'Keria.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.171
Point me to the Pastor.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.439
Come on.

10:39.439 --> 10:43.209
Which means Mercedes,
you are on Nina's team.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.611
-Welcome home.
-Come on.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.580
Gentlemen, start your engines,

10:47.580 --> 10:50.216
and may the blessed woman win.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.751
[cheers and applause]

10:53.453 --> 10:55.722
The challenge this week
is to produce and star

10:55.722 --> 10:58.525
in our very own
she-vangelical talk show.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.859
Praise Jesus.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.128
This is the meat
of what Drag Race is.

11:02.128 --> 11:05.398
The acting, the characters,
the fun, you know.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.966
Like, where
Latrice Royale made a mark

11:06.966 --> 11:09.469
was with "Get those nuts
away from my face."

11:09.469 --> 11:11.538
Right?

11:11.538 --> 11:12.972
I couldn't tell you
what she wore on the runway,

11:12.972 --> 11:14.607
but I can tell you what she did
in an acting challenge.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.010
First of all, pop diva.
Who do you know really well?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.344
[Vanjie] Britney Spears.
[Nina] Britney.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.280
[Brooke] Whitney Houston.
[Nina] Whitney.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.615
-Britney.
-Whitney over Britney.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.984
Yeah, Whitney over Britney
for me.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.252
-Whitney or Britney?
-Britney.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.021
Let's commit to Britney first.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.822
There's a little bit more
maybe to play with there.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.224
Yeah.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.027
Does anyone feel particularly
driven to any one thing?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.895
I would like to sing.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.298
Does anybody else sing?
Because I sing.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.166
I was just saying
it'd be kind of cute

11:40.166 --> 11:41.334
if you and I were the singers.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.071
Really, bitch?

11:45.071 --> 11:49.442
Last week you said Silky
is loud, Silky is obnoxious.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.678
There's a difference between
having a strong personality

11:51.678 --> 11:52.745
and being obnoxious.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.381
So what's the Tee, Christine?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.617
I said it. Who cares?

11:57.617 --> 11:59.919
Let's just build a bridge,
get over it, and move forward.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.989
I don't hate her,
but at the same time,

12:02.989 --> 12:05.725
I can't wait until she
Ariel her ass out the door.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.728
Nyah. [chuckles]

12:08.728 --> 12:12.265
Okay, so we've got Brooke Lynn
and I as the talk show hosts.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.434
I think you'd be really great
as the person who converts.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.235
-I can convert.
-I think that'd be really cute.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.037
So, Mercedes, you can be
a non-believer with me.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.405
Okay.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.108
Do you have any solid basis
for your non-believer,

12:22.108 --> 12:24.510
because I want to make sure,
like, you feel comfortable.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.648
I'm thinking.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.718
I think you should
just literally pretend

12:31.718 --> 12:34.354
you've never heard
of Britney Spears.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.355
Yeah.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.657
Be like what is
a Britney Spears?

12:37.657 --> 12:39.592
Where I come from, we do not
have a Britney Spears.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.760
We just have spears.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.228
Yeah. Yas!

12:42.228 --> 12:44.063
[all laugh]

12:44.063 --> 12:46.699
Do you feel comfortable
with that?

12:46.699 --> 12:49.435
[Yvie] Mercedes has already
gotten critiques

12:49.435 --> 12:50.470
two weeks in a row

12:50.470 --> 12:52.505
about not giving
enough personality.

12:52.505 --> 12:56.275
And if there's anything
that TV televangelists got,

12:56.275 --> 12:58.211
it's like personality.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.115
First off, we need
to pick a pop diva.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.817
Who do you guys like,
super idolize?

13:04.817 --> 13:07.654
I'm from the south,
so I was--I love Dolly.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.255
[Ra'Jah] Okay.
-Patti LaBelle.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.556
Diana Ross would be good.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.158
Diana Ross is a hard one,

13:12.158 --> 13:14.394
'cause you know that's Ru's
favorite, like, that's--

13:14.394 --> 13:15.695
[Ra'Jah] Now, that's true.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.130
So you want that risk?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.131
I think
you've got to pick somebody

13:18.131 --> 13:20.066
who's like a huge personality.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.734
And who's, like,
you can be meme-able.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.036
Whitney.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.704
[Scarlet]
Whitney would be good, too.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.773
If we pick with Whitney,
it kind of gets sensitive

13:26.773 --> 13:28.408
only because
a lot of her moments

13:28.408 --> 13:31.644
were situations where she,
you know,

13:31.644 --> 13:32.645
was in a bad place in her life.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.913
She wasn't in control.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.348
[Ra'Jah] Right.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.417
-Mariah.
-I was thinking Mariah, too.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.252
-Mariah would be fun.
-Mariah would be easy.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.854
Okay, so we're gonna go
with Mariah.

13:41.854 --> 13:42.989
[Shuga] We tried
to settle on someone

13:42.989 --> 13:44.857
that we all know
a little bit about.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.492
We are thinking collectively

13:46.492 --> 13:49.028
we'll have enough knowledge
on Mariah.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.296
I want to be the non-believer.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.631
[Ra'Jah] Okay.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.132
I'll be the correspondent,
then, all right?

13:53.132 --> 13:54.667
I'll probably do music ministry.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.836
-You're a singer, girl.
-Yeah.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.738
Is anyone else a singer
up in this joint?

13:58.738 --> 14:00.573
I can sing.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.675
Like that's really my gig.
I actually sing.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.210
[Honey] Okay. And we can get,

14:04.210 --> 14:07.113
like, a good old gospel,
like, squawk, honey.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.682
I'm feeling like my position
in the competition

14:09.682 --> 14:11.851
is very in the middle.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.152
I don't want to be there.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.555
A: I know I can hold a tune.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.256
B: I'm a lyricist,

14:17.256 --> 14:18.458
so this challenge
is my opportunity

14:18.458 --> 14:19.692
to really show myself.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.894
You seem to have the most
knowledge of her, right?

14:21.894 --> 14:23.563
'Cause you're a superfan?

14:23.563 --> 14:24.564
No, ma'am.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.898
Oh, I thought
you were saying--

14:25.898 --> 14:28.234
I love her, but I'm
the worst person at memory.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.569
What is she known for?

14:29.569 --> 14:32.105
She's known for singing,
she known for whistle tones.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.074
Straight, long, middle part.
Well--

14:35.074 --> 14:36.709
Well, that's like
visual effects,

14:36.709 --> 14:38.711
but I mean like
actual effects, right? Like--

14:38.711 --> 14:40.780
I mean, a middle part
is effects.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.982
I don't know.
What else is Mariah's songs?

14:42.982 --> 14:45.251
Honey, um...

14:45.251 --> 14:46.686
Emotions.

14:46.686 --> 14:47.887
Emotions.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.189
♪ I get so emotional, baby ♪

14:50.189 --> 14:52.091
[Scarlet] Yes.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.659
Emancipation of Mimi.

14:53.659 --> 14:54.861
[A'Keria]
That'll be the Bible.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.028
Her Bible is
The Emancipation of Mimi?

14:56.028 --> 14:57.296
It'll be
The Emancipation of Mimi.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.298
I don't know.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.534
That's one of her albums, yo.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.535
Here's the thing.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.103
I don't know a lot about Mariah,

15:04.103 --> 15:05.404
and I'm kind of gagged

15:05.404 --> 15:08.708
that nobody who's decided
that we was doing Mariah

15:08.708 --> 15:10.409
knows anything, either.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.411
We just gotta pull together
like what the facts are,

15:12.411 --> 15:13.746
what everyone knows about her

15:13.746 --> 15:15.648
and we just write them down.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.820
Howdy-do, kitty girls.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.988
Hey.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.689
-What's up, girl?
-Halleloos.

15:23.689 --> 15:24.957
Hello, Nina West team.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.193
[all] Hi, Ru.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.194
Do you have a name?

15:28.194 --> 15:29.662
Well, we're the IBBN, which is--

15:29.662 --> 15:30.897
What does that stand for?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.031
It's Britney Bitch Network.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.333
-Britney is the religion?
-Yeah, she is.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.202
So, now, Nina West,
are you familiar

15:36.202 --> 15:39.639
with the types of shows
on Christian Broadcasting?

15:39.639 --> 15:42.208
When I was younger,
Tammy Faye was always on.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.310
I just know when I go to sleep
and I leave the TV on,

15:44.310 --> 15:47.647
and I wake up,
that stuff usually is playing.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.016
Now, Ariel, last week,

15:50.016 --> 15:52.485
you didn't captivate the judges.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.021
I think I was more focused on,
like, oh, let me look good,

15:55.021 --> 15:56.989
rather than creating
a character.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.458
Listen, you got here.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.663
Now you have to find a rhythm
in this moment right here.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.997
This bitch is shaking her head,

16:04.997 --> 16:06.632
'cause the same issue
with you, Brooke Lynn.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.867
Finding that right rhythm.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.670
And look, Mercedes
is shaking her head, too.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.471
Everybody says
the exact same thing.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.874
Oh, well, this time, oh, girl,
I'm gonna get up there,

16:14.874 --> 16:16.375
I'm gonna be acting all--

16:16.375 --> 16:19.145
and I know exactly what I'm
gonna do this time, Mr. Paul.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.580
[all laugh]

16:20.580 --> 16:23.516
You have to find
your own rhythm,

16:23.516 --> 16:25.451
because you see all these other
bitches and they're fierce.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.820
You think, oh, my God,
oh, how am I gonna do this?

16:27.820 --> 16:31.591
Oh, this bitch, she got--
she's spangled her leotard.

16:31.591 --> 16:35.328
Oh, my God, she got brought
all these wigs up in here.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.529
And this ho up in here,

16:36.529 --> 16:38.097
she's sucking
all the air out the room.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.599
[all laugh]

16:39.599 --> 16:41.334
And then you get
like really nervous.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.804
Center yourself,
find your rhythm,

16:44.804 --> 16:46.505
and do you.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.140
Look, I've been
the number one bitch in the game

16:48.140 --> 16:49.642
for 25 motherfucking years.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.043
[cheers and applause]

16:51.043 --> 16:52.211
Ain't another bitch come for me.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.881
Why? Because I found
my own right rhythm.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.148
Let the church say amen.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.450
-Amen.
-That's right.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.085
So I want to see a show.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.288
Show me the Holy Spirit
in Britney's name.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.924
It's Britney, bitch. Bye.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.693
[cheers and applause]

17:07.693 --> 17:09.362
Okay, that was
kind of perfect.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.465
Look, that should be
enough inspiration

17:12.465 --> 17:14.100
for us to fucking nail this.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.570
Well, hello, Team Ra'Jah.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.105
-Hey.
-Hi, Ru.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.239
[RuPaul]
Okay, I'm dying to know

17:20.239 --> 17:23.643
which diva
you've chosen to worship.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.978
We chose Mariah Carey
as our diva.

17:25.978 --> 17:29.715
♪ Ooh and you too... ♪

17:29.715 --> 17:33.286
Was it a unanimous decision
to choose Mariah?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.487
We went through
a bunch of divas,

17:34.487 --> 17:35.621
and it was the one

17:35.621 --> 17:37.557
we all collectively
knew about the most.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.891
[RuPaul] Okay.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.627
Do any of you belong
to the Mariah Carey fan club?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.299
That's a no.
Because you know,

17:46.299 --> 17:49.669
Mariah calls her fans her...
Anybody?

17:49.669 --> 17:50.736
Her butterflies?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.004
[RuPaul] No.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.472
The Careys.

17:53.472 --> 17:54.907
No. Okay.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.576
-They're her lambs.
-Oh, nice.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.210
Yeah, you bitches
ain't done no homework.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.179
Oh, Jesus.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.447
Yeah, if you don't know
what a lamb is,

18:01.447 --> 18:03.883
how you gonna convert somebody
into a Mariah fan?

18:03.883 --> 18:06.719
Someone's
gotta be an authority.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.921
Is there an authority
in your group on Mariah Carey?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.693
There go them crickets again.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.329
What the fuck have you
been doing all this time?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.999
I love the divas, and I know
everything about them.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.000
That's what we're looking for.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.501
We're looking for something

18:22.501 --> 18:26.072
that's really gonna convert
a non-believer to Mariah-ism.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.341
Oh, shit, I'm giving away
all my good lines.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.842
We're kind of pulling all the--

18:29.842 --> 18:32.445
We're just kind of pulling
from all of common knowledge--

18:32.445 --> 18:33.446
Which is very little.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.547
It's very little, isn't it?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.983
Bring up your Mariah-isms,
okay?

18:36.983 --> 18:38.985
So can't wait to see it.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.019
Get to work.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.887
-Thank you.
-All right. See ya.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.992
Girl, was that completely
frightening for any of y'all?

18:45.992 --> 18:49.628
[Ra'Jah] So how comfortable are
we really feeling with Mariah?

18:49.628 --> 18:50.930
[Shuga] Because it don't seem
like we know a lot of fan.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.365
It's not like--

18:52.365 --> 18:54.400
[Shuga] It's getting
very confused right now.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.701
Right.

18:55.701 --> 18:56.836
[Scarlet]
I mean, I don't know.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.471
I think we just stick
with what we have.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.708
Okay. Let's stick
to the game plan.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.911
We are not
the ultimate Mariah fans,

19:05.911 --> 19:07.580
but we have a love for Mariah,

19:07.580 --> 19:10.049
so I'm feeling confident
in my team.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.451
Come on, Team Mariah.

19:12.451 --> 19:17.423
Come on, lambs.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.458
[Ross] Hello, ladies.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.727
Or as Britney would say,
hi, y'all.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.129
[all] Hi, y'all.

19:23.129 --> 19:26.165
[Ross] Okay, so you are
trying to get everybody

19:26.165 --> 19:28.634
to join the Church of Britney.

19:28.634 --> 19:32.038
You must convert us
with your passion.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.040
This is also live television,

19:34.040 --> 19:35.875
so there's no take two.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.744
There's no, oops,
and then you do it again.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.446
[all laugh]

19:40.446 --> 19:42.415
So let's get ready for Act 1.

19:42.415 --> 19:46.052
[Yvie] We're about
to shoot our talk show,

19:46.052 --> 19:47.386
and I'm just
a little bit worried

19:47.386 --> 19:48.621
because we have
three of the girls

19:48.621 --> 19:50.690
who were in the bottom
last week.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.892
So I'm just hoping
they're going to use that

19:52.892 --> 19:54.260
to light a fire under their ass

19:54.260 --> 19:56.495
and really nail it out
this week.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.798
Three, two...

19:58.798 --> 19:59.932
Action.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.237
Oh, hello, friends,

20:05.237 --> 20:09.508
and welcome to IBBN,
It's Britney Bitch Network.

20:09.508 --> 20:11.944
My name is Nina West,
your host today,

20:11.944 --> 20:15.147
of the Gimme More Hour of Power
prayer session.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.284
Welcome as we worship our deity,

20:18.284 --> 20:21.687
the holy Britney Jean Spears.

20:21.687 --> 20:24.690
With me today is my co-host

20:24.690 --> 20:26.459
Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.493
Hey, Brooke Lynn.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.762
I love Britney Spears.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.530
Testify, sister.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.700
When I was a young woman,
I felt like a genie in a bottle.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.202
-Oh!
-And it was dirty.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.203
Within.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.604
But then Miss Britney Spears,

20:38.604 --> 20:42.108
her spirit has come in me,
and it has filled me up.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.642
That's filthy.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.978
And she can come in you
and fill you up, too.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.413
Hallelujah.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.281
Why don't you tell
the good folks out there

20:49.281 --> 20:52.818
how they can give back to
somebody who's given us so much.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.286
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:54.286 --> 20:57.590
we have set up the Leave
Britney Alone Foundation.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.958
Your offerings today

20:58.958 --> 21:02.728
will help supply frappuccinos,
frothy and delicious.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.397
Also, car seats
and safety belts.

21:05.397 --> 21:08.000
We are doing the Lord's work
here, ladies and gentlemen.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.335
So y'all stay tuned.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.903
We'll be right back.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.371
[Ross] Cut. All right.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.572
We're out to commercial.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.708
Good. Let's move on
for the conversion.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.910
I feel like a proud sister.

21:17.910 --> 21:21.780
Nina is setting the mood, baby,
and she's selling it to me.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.484
Three, two, one, action.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.787
Welcome back

21:27.787 --> 21:30.189
to the Gimme More Hour of Power
prayer circle.

21:30.189 --> 21:34.126
Right now, we are going
to have a live conversion.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.327
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:35.327 --> 21:37.563
please welcome
to the IBBN stage,

21:37.563 --> 21:39.999
Miss Vanjie.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.034
Can I get a Britney?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.636
-Britney!
-Thank you, sisters.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.137
All right.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.907
Now, I have randomly picked
two whores

21:47.907 --> 21:50.276
that don't know shit
about Britney.

21:50.276 --> 21:52.678
That they don't know
about Hit Me, Baby.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.780
They don't know about
Oops, I did it.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.582
They don't know about
the hair whipping.

21:56.582 --> 21:57.583
They don't know
about Work, Bitch.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.218
They don't know about Lucky.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.086
They don't know about Sometimes.
They don't frappe drink.

22:01.086 --> 22:04.089
They don't walk to the 7-Eleven
without shoes, Jesus.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.291
Thank you, Britney.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.425
-Amen.
-Amen.

22:06.425 --> 22:09.061
Now, bring out
the chuggerheads, please.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.663
In Britney's name.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.699
Oh, y'all see
what I gotta work with?

22:13.699 --> 22:17.069
But we shall get lucky.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.638
What is your name and where
are you from, young lady?

22:19.638 --> 22:21.874
My name is Yvie,

22:21.874 --> 22:25.611
and I'm from, like, some
shithole in the Midwest.

22:25.611 --> 22:29.415
Hmm. I will attempt live

22:29.415 --> 22:32.718
one of my Britney Spears
rituals.

22:32.718 --> 22:35.788
We taking it down to 2007.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.524
I'm attempting
the Britney scalping.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.159
-Oh, my God.
-Get this.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.327
Get this hair.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.529
In Britney's name!

22:43.529 --> 22:45.731
-Oh!
-Yes!

22:45.731 --> 22:49.335
Now, in Britney's name,
Stronger perfume.

22:49.335 --> 22:50.336
Can I get a hit, y'all?

22:50.336 --> 22:51.503
Oh, hit me, baby.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.205
- Hit ya!
-Baby!

22:53.205 --> 22:55.007
Yes!

22:55.007 --> 22:58.277
Amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
We've done it.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.545
Britney. It's a Britney!

22:59.545 --> 23:02.014
You helped me
break the ice,

23:02.014 --> 23:03.782
and I'm stronger than yesterday.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.752
You can get her music available
on iTunes and everything else.

23:06.752 --> 23:08.254
Thank you, Miss Vanjie.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.489
I thanked myself.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.157
And you, too, Britney.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.425
I'm falling out of character

23:13.425 --> 23:15.461
because there's one thing
about Vanessa.

23:15.461 --> 23:19.365
When that bitch opens her mouth,
it's an amazing thing to watch.

23:19.365 --> 23:20.599
Thank you, Miss Vanjie.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.835
I just thanked myself.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.437
Moving right along
to ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.

23:25.437 --> 23:26.705
My name is Mercedes,

23:26.705 --> 23:29.408
and I am from
the jungles in Africa.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.043
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!

23:31.043 --> 23:33.612
Have you ever heard
of Mrs. Spears?

23:33.612 --> 23:36.148
What is spears?
What's Britney?

23:36.148 --> 23:39.485
Where I'm from,
we only have spears.

23:40.552 --> 23:42.187
Girl.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.123
Oh, my God,
you have one job.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.826
If it worked on sis,
it will work on this.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.296
All right, Stronger by Britney.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.964
-Come on, now.
-Aah!

23:51.964 --> 23:54.900
Hit me, baby,
hit me, baby, hit me, baby.

23:54.900 --> 23:55.968
-Yes!
-Oh!

23:55.968 --> 23:58.971
And we got it. Yes!

23:58.971 --> 24:00.572
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.775
Get that choreography.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.044
Hit me, baby, one more time.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.813
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is Miss Vanjie.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.181
Take it back, sisters.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.483
-Thank you, sister.
-Why, hell.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.952
-Holy Britney.
-Can you believe it?

24:13.952 --> 24:15.788
I cannot believe it.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.656
I'm so inspired
and on fire right now.

24:17.656 --> 24:18.691
I know.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.926
Next we have a musical guest

24:20.926 --> 24:24.129
that is so good,
y'all might just black out.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.664
Oh, that was good.

24:25.664 --> 24:28.534
We'll see y'all in a minute.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.602
Okay, we're at commercial.

24:30.602 --> 24:32.504
I'm feeling like I wanna get up

24:32.504 --> 24:34.506
and do a Vegas show
my fucking self.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.809
[all laugh]

24:36.809 --> 24:38.110
All right, ladies,
it's time for the final act.

24:38.110 --> 24:41.080
[Ariel] Now is my opportunity
to really shine

24:41.080 --> 24:44.650
and show people that Ariel
is number one, an entertainer.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.354
Three, two, one, action.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.189
Welcome back.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.824
Now, we know some of you

24:51.824 --> 24:53.292

from work, bitch,

24:53.292 --> 24:57.396

[Ariel]
Ross looks like he's living.

26:00.692 --> 26:01.693
It's silly, it's stupid,
it's fun.

26:01.693 --> 26:03.796
We remember all the words.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.531
We're letting the song
have it that we wrote.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.991
[Vanjie] As a unit,
we broke through,

26:32.991 --> 26:35.828
'cause even Beyoncé and Kelly
gotta pull Michelle.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.463
So we did that.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.797
Now, you probably
can't air that,

26:38.797 --> 26:42.468
but if I gotta rephrase it,
I will.

26:42.468 --> 26:46.171
Collectively,
we slayed the challenge.

-Thank you.
-[Ross] Bye, ladies.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.708

26:52.911 --> 26:56.648
It's time for us to shoot
our she-vangelical TV show.

26:56.648 --> 26:57.850
Hey, hey, hi.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.651
This is live with one take.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.019
[Ra'Jah] Baby, we
are praising Mariah.

27:01.019 --> 27:05.257
We're about to convert
these sheeps into these lambs.

27:05.257 --> 27:09.027
All right, we're live
in three, two...action.

27:12.197 --> 27:16.301
Welcome, my little lambs,

27:16.301 --> 27:19.838
to When You Believe,

27:19.838 --> 27:23.942
the Church of Mariah Carey.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.477
[Shuga Cain] Oh, yes,
my little lambs.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.046
This hour,
we will worship and praise

27:28.046 --> 27:32.050
the Emancipation of Mimi,
darling.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.619
Can I get an amen?

27:33.619 --> 27:35.320
Amen!

27:35.320 --> 27:37.322
Now, I think
we need to start out

27:37.322 --> 27:39.324
with a little prayer.
[clears throat]

27:39.324 --> 27:41.426
Dearly beloved,

27:41.426 --> 27:44.329
we are gathered here today

27:44.329 --> 27:47.566
in the name of love.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.035
And though we may walk
through the valley

27:50.035 --> 27:52.037
of technical difficulties

27:52.037 --> 27:55.574
and false whistle tones,
honey...

27:55.574 --> 27:57.142
Whoo.

27:57.142 --> 28:01.813
We are here
in the name of Mariah.

28:04.283 --> 28:07.719
Can I get an amen?

28:07.719 --> 28:10.055
Amen!

28:10.055 --> 28:11.356
[laughs]

28:11.356 --> 28:13.892
Girl, what's going on here?

28:13.892 --> 28:16.762
Now, Minister Shuga,
nothing happens for free.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.063
No, ma'am.

28:18.063 --> 28:22.401
And for the low, low, low,
low, low price of 49.99,

28:22.401 --> 28:23.902
you, too, can make it happen

28:23.902 --> 28:26.405
with this beautiful
butterfly here.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.040
[Shuga] It is not just
any butterfly, honey.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.474
It is a miracle butterfly.

28:29.474 --> 28:34.313
So make sure you dial
1-800-MARIAH

28:34.313 --> 28:35.881
for the miracle, darling.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.149
Ooh, yes.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.618
But speaking heroes,
you did say heroes, honey.

28:39.618 --> 28:42.521
We have a sister in Mariah,

28:42.521 --> 28:43.922
Miss Plastique Tiara, honey.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.057
Ooh, girl.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.925
You are not gonna want
to miss this girl.

28:46.925 --> 28:50.429
I hear there is a non-believer
in our house.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.830
[gasps]

28:51.830 --> 28:53.799
Viewers, stick around.

28:53.799 --> 28:56.602
Stick around.

28:56.602 --> 28:57.769
[Ross] Okay.

28:57.769 --> 29:00.472
Now don't go you making
like an ex-fiancé.

29:00.472 --> 29:01.807
You better stick around
with us.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.342
We'll be right back

29:03.342 --> 29:07.312
with Sister Plastique
and a live conversion.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.680
Whoo.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.315
And we're in commercial.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.017
Girl.

29:12.017 --> 29:14.152
[sighs]

29:14.152 --> 29:17.022
Let's move on
to the conversion segment.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.423
Ooh.

29:18.423 --> 29:22.494
In three, two, one, action.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.663
Now, welcome on back, y'all,

29:24.663 --> 29:29.301
to When You Believe,
the Church of Mariah Carey.

29:29.301 --> 29:32.270
Now, not everything
has to be live, Miss Shuga.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.271
That is true, honey.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.273
Especially vocals.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.276
But we have something
incredibly live today,

29:38.276 --> 29:42.280
and I am so happy
to introduce Sister Plastique

29:42.280 --> 29:45.517
and a very, very live
conversion.

29:45.517 --> 29:49.254
Right before
our very eyes, Shuga.

29:49.254 --> 29:51.957
Oh, hello darlings.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.861
My name is Plastique Tiara
of the Mariah-ism,

29:55.861 --> 30:00.332
and today me and my girls,
Morocco and Monroe,

30:00.332 --> 30:04.436
are so happy to have found
a long lost lamb

30:04.436 --> 30:06.471
passed out on the sidewalk

30:06.471 --> 30:09.441
[deep voice]
of an Ariana Grande

30:09.441 --> 30:11.109
[normal voice]
One Last Time fellowship.

30:12.177 --> 30:15.313
Girl, fish turned into a demon.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.315
Everybody please welcome

30:17.315 --> 30:21.219
A'Keria Dupree Davenport
O'Hara Brown.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.622
Hello, sweetie.
How are you doing today?

30:23.622 --> 30:24.756
I've been set up.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.792
Oh, God, I've been--
oh, don't.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.193
Oh, you got bugs on you, bitch.

30:28.193 --> 30:29.428
Oh! Nick Cannon.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.429
Oh, my God.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.596
[Plastique] Oh, my God.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.432
The power of Ariana Grande
is you.

30:33.432 --> 30:34.833
The power
of Ariana Grande is you.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.867
[deep voice]
Ariana Grande.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.870
That's not a good choice.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.606
Thank God she pretty, though.

30:41.606 --> 30:45.410
Sweetie, you are here to be
converted into one our lambs.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.746
Never gonna happen.
I tried to give her a chance.

30:47.746 --> 30:51.416
About five years ago,
I watched that movie Sparkle

30:51.416 --> 30:52.584
that she starred in.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.286
We love Sparkle.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.587
Sparkle?

30:55.587 --> 30:56.955
Why don't we love Sparkle?

30:56.955 --> 30:58.790
That movie didn't go
no further than her marriage.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.959
And then I tried to give her
a second chance

31:00.959 --> 31:03.161
and she didn't even sing live.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.097
Oh, sweetie, oh, sweetie,
it was--

31:05.097 --> 31:06.498
[deep voice]
it was a microphone problem.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.966
Liar Carey.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.301
[Plastique] Don't worry.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.368
Ariana.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.937
Because when you look
into my eyes,

31:11.937 --> 31:13.338
you will feel...

31:13.338 --> 31:15.941
[deep voice]
you will feel...

31:15.941 --> 31:17.275
[high pitched]
So aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

31:17.275 --> 31:20.078
Ariana. Ariana.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.080
Ariana. Ariana.
[Plastique screeching]

31:22.080 --> 31:23.982
Ariana. Ariana.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.684
-Mariah.
-Yes.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.152
-Mariah!
-Yes!

31:27.152 --> 31:31.056
Aah!

31:32.424 --> 31:35.994
And how--that is how
we belong together.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.763
Now back to you, Scarlet.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.197
Ooh.

31:39.197 --> 31:40.866
[Shuga] Oh, my Lord.

31:40.866 --> 31:41.867
I tell you--

31:41.867 --> 31:43.635
What are you telling?

31:43.635 --> 31:44.803
I used to be
a non-believer, honey,

31:44.803 --> 31:48.073
but that just shows
in live television,

31:48.073 --> 31:50.575
the power that is Mariah, honey.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.879
Get ready, because we've got
more treats up for you today

31:53.879 --> 31:57.182
here on The Church
of Mariah, honey.

31:57.182 --> 31:58.550
We will be back.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.786
Oh, girl.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.888
And we're at commercial break.

32:02.888 --> 32:05.657
Next up, the music segment.
Let's set up.

32:05.657 --> 32:08.493
I know we are a little bit
more struggle-butts

32:08.493 --> 32:09.961
than I really wanted us to be,

32:09.961 --> 32:13.799
but, girl, me and Honey is
about to turn the party, girl.

32:13.799 --> 32:17.235
♪ Throw glitter

32:17.235 --> 32:19.070

Hold on.

32:19.070 --> 32:23.241
Three, two, one, action.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.944
Now, welcome on back,
our little lambs.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.548
Miss Shuga,
I think it's time to sing.

32:29.548 --> 32:33.418
Oh, honey, what better way
to express the Mariah-ism

32:33.418 --> 32:36.621
than through the gospel
of music, honey?

32:36.621 --> 32:40.625
We have our very own
Sister Honey and Sister Ra'Jah.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.861
That's right,
don't you forget about us.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.963
Ha ha. Now...

32:48.767 --> 32:50.802
This is her glitter,

32:50.802 --> 32:55.073
which she has boxed
off this crash for us.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.909
[all laugh]

32:57.909 --> 32:59.811
Not only was it just
an emancipation, Lord,

32:59.811 --> 33:02.180
I just want
to let you lambs know,

33:02.180 --> 33:07.085
ain't nothing too deep
for this glitter can't help.

33:07.085 --> 33:10.722
This glitter can power for--
it can power through anything.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.457
Anything.

33:12.457 --> 33:15.460
Miss Honey, I think we ought
to sing these people a song.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.629
In just a minute, because
I need to let y'all know

33:17.629 --> 33:19.164
-before we sing this song--
-But you--

33:19.164 --> 33:21.766
That love do take time,

33:21.766 --> 33:24.703
but you, too, can join
into Camp Mariah, honey.

33:24.703 --> 33:28.773
And if you do,
she will be your music boxer.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.343
Now, can I get
a $28 million contract?

33:31.343 --> 33:32.911
Oh, where is my Tommy Mottola?

33:32.911 --> 33:34.946
Where is my Tommy Mottola?

33:34.946 --> 33:36.514
[Ra'Jah] But all right.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.117
Let's go on ahead
and get this thing started.

She keep bending notes.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.659
Girl, you're bending notes.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.161
You're supposed to stick
with the melody, girl.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.729
They're both off.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.665
She should have been
touching her ear

34:26.665 --> 34:29.734
and saying I'm having
a technical difficulty.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.037
Well, y'all, this has been
a glorious, beautiful hour.

34:32.037 --> 34:33.204
Whoo.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.907
We are going to say goodbye
to you today.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.409
But remember...

34:37.409 --> 34:39.878
[both] if you can't
make it happen,

34:39.878 --> 34:42.013
let Mariah make it happen.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.181
-Let's take it away.
-Whoo.

34:56.461 --> 34:58.697
That was quite a show.

34:58.697 --> 34:59.698
Whoo.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.967
My parting bit of advice to you.

35:03.301 --> 35:04.669
Bring it on the runway.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.673
Thank you.

35:08.673 --> 35:13.278
Overall,
I think our team is, um...

35:14.346 --> 35:16.348
Headed to the gate.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.482
And it ain't of heaven.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.822
Girl, the church scene
is over.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.056
It's time for the runway.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.092
Today is elimination day.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.060
I'm just not feeling confident

35:29.060 --> 35:30.595
about my team's challenge
yesterday.

35:30.595 --> 35:33.865
I'm like in my feelings today
about the whole thing.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.100
Why?

35:35.100 --> 35:36.835
Like, I'm going over,
like, our little hiccup.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.571
I'm going over
the little musical hiccup.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.806
[Honey]
Some of my team is nervous,

35:41.806 --> 35:43.708
which kind of makes me nervous.

35:43.708 --> 35:47.212
'Cause I thought I did,
like, out of the park job.

35:47.212 --> 35:49.814
Or am I having,
like, a Milk moment?

35:49.814 --> 35:52.784
Where I thought
I really slayed it,

35:52.784 --> 35:56.654
but on the camera, no.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.823
The only thing we can do
is bring it to the runway.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.958
-All right?
-Bring it to the runway.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.162
-Hi, Papi.
-Hi.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.231
How are you?

36:06.231 --> 36:07.265
Good.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.669
What's going on?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.405
I've been noticing
Brooke and Vanjie

36:13.405 --> 36:16.808
with this little
cuddle buddy type stuff, girl.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.309
[Brooke] You were so good
yesterday.

36:18.309 --> 36:21.679
I was feeling the spirit,
the Holy Ghost.

36:21.679 --> 36:22.847
Mmm-mmm.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.549
[Brooke] It was so good.
-Thank you.

36:24.549 --> 36:28.386
It might be something beautiful
blossoms from this workroom.

36:28.386 --> 36:29.320
Mm-hmm.

36:30.655 --> 36:33.391
Bitch, what was your jush
in the thing?

36:33.391 --> 36:34.726
♪ Li-li-li-li ♪

36:34.726 --> 36:37.362
Yeah. 'Cause you guys
went to Wakanda for that.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.897
Oh, girl, I sure did.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.065
Well, that's good, because,

36:40.065 --> 36:41.199
you know, I've never
been to a church,

36:41.199 --> 36:43.034
so it was like a good idea,
like, you know--

36:43.034 --> 36:44.035
-You've never been to church?
-No.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.336
A church
or church in general?

36:45.336 --> 36:46.838
-Church in general.
-She's a Muslim.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.006
-So it was just like--
-She what?

36:48.006 --> 36:49.974
Muslims--I thought that
Muslims go to church.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.177
Y'all go to mausoleums?

36:52.177 --> 36:54.312
No, mosques.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.914
Ain't that like church,
though?

36:55.914 --> 36:58.016
But, I mean, church to me
is just a building.

36:58.016 --> 37:01.119
In your culture,
how do y'all worship Allah?

37:01.119 --> 37:02.454
I think that's what
you're trying to say.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.455
Is that what you worship?

37:03.455 --> 37:04.789
How do you worship Allah?

45:47.211 --> 45:48.579
and you may leave the stage.

45:53.017 --> 45:56.287
Ladies, you are all up
for elimination.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.856
It's time for
the judges' critiques,

45:58.856 --> 46:02.193
starting with Scarlet Envy.

46:02.193 --> 46:03.628
I loved this glam.

46:03.628 --> 46:06.564
I think that you hair and makeup
look absolutely stunning.

46:06.564 --> 46:08.399
[Guillermo]
As far as the challenge,

46:08.399 --> 46:11.836
I wish you guys would have paid
a little bit more homage

46:11.836 --> 46:13.371
to Mariah Carey.

46:13.371 --> 46:15.172
I kept thinking, wait,
who are they talking about?

46:15.172 --> 46:19.510
Sort of put the pacing
of the whole scene on you

46:19.510 --> 46:20.811
because you were the host.

46:20.811 --> 46:22.680
You had the role that Nina had
in the other group,

46:22.680 --> 46:24.682
and she really
kind of kept things moving.

46:24.682 --> 46:26.617
And it felt to me like
the group as a whole

46:26.617 --> 46:28.552
felt a little like panicked.

46:28.552 --> 46:32.290
[RuPaul] In fact, when I visited
you all backstage,

46:32.290 --> 46:35.192
I got the sense that you guys
didn't know a lot about Mariah.

46:35.192 --> 46:38.329
I sort of lent you
some of my knowledge of Mariah,

46:38.329 --> 46:40.631
and you seemed
to have used all of it.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.467
I was afraid that might happen.

46:43.467 --> 46:44.902
All right, Shuga Cain.

46:44.902 --> 46:47.938
The look tonight, I love that
you are showing who you are.

46:47.938 --> 46:50.141
Moi, Shuga Cain,
yo soy Cubano.

46:50.141 --> 46:53.444
I loved that you are Apache
and Latina. It's so unique.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.413
[Troye]
As far as the challenge goes,

46:55.413 --> 46:56.547
what I said to Scarlet,
same note to you.

46:56.547 --> 46:58.549
I think that the host
really could have

46:58.549 --> 47:00.217
picked up the pace
of the whole scene.

47:00.217 --> 47:01.519
Yeah, on Scandal,
we have this thing.

47:01.519 --> 47:02.820
When we do a scene,
they would say

47:02.820 --> 47:03.921
you guys
have to Scandal pace it.

47:03.921 --> 47:05.890
And if that pace is there.

47:05.890 --> 47:07.692
it always
makes the scene better.

47:07.692 --> 47:09.660
And I feel like that pace,
especially for the two hosts,

47:09.660 --> 47:12.396
was kind of missing.

47:12.396 --> 47:14.432
Plastique Tiara.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.400
You had such a crucial part.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.136
You were serving
a live conversion,

47:19.136 --> 47:21.572
and you were taking
some big swings

47:21.572 --> 47:22.707
with the [deep voice]
Ariana Grande voice,

47:22.707 --> 47:24.141
but it didn't work.

47:24.141 --> 47:27.812
I don't know that you had
like a real love for Mariah.

47:27.812 --> 47:30.181
I only found out
about pop culture

47:30.181 --> 47:32.249
about like three years ago.

47:32.249 --> 47:33.684
[Ross] Really?

47:33.684 --> 47:34.819
Yeah.

47:34.819 --> 47:36.620
Did they not know
no Mariah in Vietnam?

47:36.620 --> 47:39.890
No, girl. I came over
when I was 11,

47:39.890 --> 47:43.961
but I found out about Beyoncé
legit four years ago.

47:43.961 --> 47:45.730
[RuPaul] This is where

47:45.730 --> 47:47.565
you all could have
worked together as a group

47:47.565 --> 47:49.400
to educate each other.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.068
But also,
you guys got to choose

47:51.068 --> 47:54.405
who you wanted to worship.

47:54.405 --> 47:56.273
Was there anybody else
that you thought, oh,

47:56.273 --> 47:59.276
maybe we should do
Madonna, Gaga,

47:59.276 --> 48:01.078
Cher, and J-lo...

48:01.078 --> 48:02.747
Latoya.

48:02.747 --> 48:06.016
We all agree that
we can get more material

48:06.016 --> 48:09.487
for Mariah,
but like I said,

48:09.487 --> 48:12.189
I'm not really big
into the pop culture.

48:12.189 --> 48:15.993
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport.

48:15.993 --> 48:19.263
In my notes, I wrote down
"chandelieria, love."

48:19.263 --> 48:22.566
It kind of reminds me of like
a couture Carol Burnett,

48:22.566 --> 48:24.068
you know, Bob Mackie costume.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.369
It's really unique.

48:25.369 --> 48:28.839
Tonight you just look
like out of this word stunning.

48:28.839 --> 48:32.243
This is like exactly
what I was hoping to see

48:32.243 --> 48:33.711
when I was told
that I was coming to Drag Race.

48:33.711 --> 48:34.912
Thank you.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.481
I actually didn't hate
your performance.

48:37.481 --> 48:40.084
[Ross] But there was not
enough set-up for me.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.753
Why is she touching
the earring? Oh, they're As.

48:42.753 --> 48:43.788
Oh, Ariana. Okay.

48:43.788 --> 48:46.157
I was having to figure it out.

48:46.157 --> 48:47.391
I just wish you would have

48:47.391 --> 48:49.393
really explained
everything better,

48:49.393 --> 48:51.495
'cause I don't want
to do the work

48:51.495 --> 48:53.898
All right, up next,
Honey Davenport.

48:53.898 --> 48:55.099
I loved your interpretation
of fringe.

48:55.099 --> 48:56.333
I want to like wear it

48:56.333 --> 48:58.702
to brunch or something
like that, really bad.

48:58.702 --> 49:00.171
[laughs]

49:00.171 --> 49:01.672
[Troye] But as far
as the challenge goes,

49:01.672 --> 49:04.208
you two at the end,
musically...

49:04.208 --> 49:05.743
it was interesting.

49:05.743 --> 49:07.311
I don't know if you were like

49:07.311 --> 49:09.280
trying to figure out your
harmonies or what was going on.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.549
Everyone knows these women.

49:11.549 --> 49:12.650
Take us to church.

49:12.650 --> 49:14.752
But for me, it fell flat.

49:14.752 --> 49:16.987
To be honest,
in these last two weeks,

49:16.987 --> 49:19.890
I don't know why
I have been like so in here

49:19.890 --> 49:21.592
and not projecting out there.

49:21.592 --> 49:22.793
But, Honey--
and this goes for everyone--

49:22.793 --> 49:24.295
look at these divas
that we're worshipping.

49:24.295 --> 49:26.864
Even they have human moments.

49:26.864 --> 49:30.467
But when the light's on,
we don't know about it.

49:30.467 --> 49:33.304
Well, New Year's Eve
when Mariah Carey--

49:33.304 --> 49:35.806
How dare you bring that up.
How dare you bring that up.

49:35.806 --> 49:38.776
[laughs]
Up next, Ra'Jah O'Hara.

49:38.776 --> 49:40.811
You know what
I'm going to say about tonight.

49:40.811 --> 49:42.379
Listen, guys,
you're drag queens.

49:42.379 --> 49:45.583
I know that a leotard
is going to happen a few times,

49:45.583 --> 49:46.917
but let's take a look at Shuga

49:46.917 --> 49:48.886
and how she made it
not so obvious.

49:48.886 --> 49:51.655
And when you're standing
next to these chicks,

49:51.655 --> 49:54.124
it's hard for you
not to get watered down.

49:54.124 --> 49:55.226
Do you know what I'm saying?

49:55.226 --> 49:56.293
I do.

49:56.293 --> 49:57.695
In the challenge,
compared to Honey,

49:57.695 --> 49:58.863
you were a little better.

49:58.863 --> 50:00.364
But it was very clear

50:00.364 --> 50:02.833
which team
was on the bottom this week.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.135
The job was to be funny

50:05.135 --> 50:08.272
and convert us
to the church of Mariah.

50:08.272 --> 50:09.974
But the teamwork wasn't there.
It wasn't clicking.

50:09.974 --> 50:10.975
I was a little bummed out

50:10.975 --> 50:13.544
to see you guys
not have a clear vision.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.746
[RuPaul] Yeah, because
we're actually trying to see

50:15.746 --> 50:19.650
if you girls have what it takes
to run a show.

50:19.650 --> 50:23.287
But I have three words
for all of you girls

50:23.287 --> 50:25.789
in terms of this challenge:

50:25.789 --> 50:27.958
stink, stank, stunk.

50:27.958 --> 50:30.628
I'd like to know
from each of you

50:30.628 --> 50:31.896
who's responsible?

50:31.896 --> 50:33.197
I'll take responsibility.

50:33.197 --> 50:35.366
If I would have
suggested somebody

50:35.366 --> 50:36.867
that I could have
really conveyed,

50:36.867 --> 50:38.068
we would have done
a little better.

50:38.068 --> 50:39.570
So you're blaming yourself?

50:39.570 --> 50:40.971
I'm definitely
taking responsibility

50:40.971 --> 50:42.239
for my flaws in the challenge,

50:42.239 --> 50:46.610
and I know that mine
was definitely a big part of it.

50:46.610 --> 50:49.013
I want to say as a whole
we all dropped the ball.

50:49.013 --> 50:51.782
Scarlet, who do you think
is responsible for this?

50:51.782 --> 50:53.284
Well, I agree with my sisters.

50:53.284 --> 50:56.253
As a team, we--I don't want
to single anyone out.

50:56.253 --> 50:59.356
I mean, I myself
flubbed a few puns

50:59.356 --> 51:00.858
that I had written down.

51:00.858 --> 51:01.992
What about you, Shuga?

51:01.992 --> 51:03.928
-I really do feel the same.
-The same what?

51:03.928 --> 51:05.796
I feel like
we all dropped the ball.

51:05.796 --> 51:07.865
What about you, Plastique?

51:07.865 --> 51:08.866
I pretty much agree.

51:08.866 --> 51:10.134
We all reached a group consensus

51:10.134 --> 51:11.535
of what celebrities
that we're gonna do.

51:11.535 --> 51:13.103
I came in
with the least knowledge,

51:13.103 --> 51:14.738
so I was the weak link
of the group.

51:14.738 --> 51:17.541
The least knowledge, but you
know what this competition is.

51:17.541 --> 51:19.109
You know what
is expected of you.

51:19.109 --> 51:20.711
The truth is
if you don't know,

51:20.711 --> 51:22.179
you better ask somebody.

51:22.179 --> 51:23.914
What about you, Ra'Jah?

51:23.914 --> 51:27.184
Doing Mariah, it wasn't
something that I just threw out.

51:27.184 --> 51:28.419
But I feel like maybe

51:28.419 --> 51:30.654
if would have just
took a little bit more time

51:30.654 --> 51:32.756
to figure out a diva
that we all knew

51:32.756 --> 51:34.591
a little bit more about,

51:34.591 --> 51:36.193
that we could actually
embody the essence

51:36.193 --> 51:37.895
of that entertainer.

51:39.496 --> 51:42.733
All right. Ladies,
while you untuck backstage,

51:42.733 --> 51:44.568
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:46.270 --> 51:49.006
All right. Just between
us squirrel friends,

51:49.006 --> 51:51.909
what do you think,
starting with Scarlet Envy?

51:51.909 --> 51:53.944
In the challenge,
it didn't work for me.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.980
I wasn't drawn
into the character.

51:55.980 --> 51:57.081
[Troye] She didn't
carry the scene

51:57.081 --> 51:58.349
like I think she could have.

51:58.349 --> 52:00.884
[Michelle] I was really let down
by Scarlet this week

52:00.884 --> 52:02.786
because she did so great
last week.

52:02.786 --> 52:05.522
It was literally
the same character

52:05.522 --> 52:07.491
only in
the church lady's costume.

52:07.491 --> 52:09.693
All right, let's move on
the Shuga Cain.

52:09.693 --> 52:11.629
As a host,
she fell flat for me.

52:11.629 --> 52:14.565
I can't think of one
like positive thing

52:14.565 --> 52:16.834
about the challenge for her.

52:16.834 --> 52:18.102
I did appreciate--

52:18.102 --> 52:19.837
she was going
for that Jan Crouch thing.

52:19.837 --> 52:20.904
[Ross]
I thought she was actually

52:20.904 --> 52:22.406
the best in this group.

52:22.406 --> 52:24.408
I mean, that's not saying much.
This group was not great.

52:24.408 --> 52:26.010
But when you're on
a sinking ship,

52:26.010 --> 52:27.211
honey, you're like me
on a first date.

52:27.211 --> 52:28.245
You're still going down.

52:28.245 --> 52:30.647
[laughs]

52:30.647 --> 52:33.517
[RuPaul] Let's move on
to Plastique Tiara.

52:33.517 --> 52:36.153
[Michelle] Her look out of
everybody excited me the most.

52:36.153 --> 52:37.588
I was like, oh,
she's gonna nail this.

52:37.588 --> 52:40.658
And then it literally
went nowhere.

52:40.658 --> 52:42.659
She did really well in
the acting challenge last week.

52:42.659 --> 52:44.661
She created a character,
and it worked.

52:44.661 --> 52:47.431
This week it was just
sort of a mess for me.

52:47.431 --> 52:50.501
[RuPaul]
A'Keria Chanel Davenport.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.269
I think she was
near the bottom for me,

52:52.269 --> 52:55.839
because the whole piece
rested on the conversion.

52:55.839 --> 52:59.343
We needed her to come out
on that stage a non-believer,

52:59.343 --> 53:01.678
and then be a born-again
Mariah believer.

53:01.678 --> 53:04.248
And the scene didn't work.

53:04.248 --> 53:05.916
And worshipping Ariana Grande.
If you're gonna do that,

53:05.916 --> 53:07.484
then come out
in a gray ponytail.

53:07.484 --> 53:09.620
[Troye] I completely agree
about the ponytail.

53:09.620 --> 53:11.321
If you're gonna be
an Ariana stan,

53:11.321 --> 53:12.523
that didn't come across to me.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.258
She could have come out
licking a doughnut.

53:14.258 --> 53:15.726
[Troye] She could have--yeah.

53:15.726 --> 53:17.027
-Hilarious, Michelle.
-Yeah.

53:17.027 --> 53:19.063
All right, Honey Davenport.

53:19.063 --> 53:20.164
In the sketch, for me,

53:20.164 --> 53:22.099
Honey and Ra'Jah
sort of were a package.

53:22.099 --> 53:25.602
My critiques for both of them
are pretty much the same

53:25.602 --> 53:26.870
in that it just didn't work.

53:26.870 --> 53:28.372
It just didn't gel.

53:28.372 --> 53:29.606
Then they started singing,

53:29.606 --> 53:32.276
and it was literally like
please just stop, guys.

53:32.276 --> 53:33.610
[laughs]

53:33.610 --> 53:35.979
And they're not even
improv-ing that much,

53:35.979 --> 53:37.781
because they had already
put together the song.

53:37.781 --> 53:39.016
Allegedly.

53:39.016 --> 53:40.317
-[laughs]
-Allegedly.

53:40.317 --> 53:41.685
They weren't coming up
on the fly

53:41.685 --> 53:42.686
with what they were gonna say.

53:42.686 --> 53:43.687
They had it prepared.

53:43.687 --> 53:46.156
You gotta work hard
to mess that up.

53:46.156 --> 53:47.758
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

53:47.758 --> 53:51.195
On the runway tonight,
we just have seen it.

53:51.195 --> 53:52.329
It's average.

53:52.329 --> 53:53.564
[Michelle] This isn't a bar.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.232
You would wear that at a bar.

53:55.232 --> 53:57.768
This is RuPaul's Drag Race
main stage.

53:57.768 --> 53:59.269
Michelle, if this isn't a bar,

53:59.269 --> 54:01.872
why do you come to work
drunk every day?

54:01.872 --> 54:04.208
[all laugh]

54:04.208 --> 54:06.009
[slurring]
Good question.

54:06.009 --> 54:07.177
[Guillermo]
Again, like Troye said,

54:07.177 --> 54:09.213
I feel like her and Honey,

54:09.213 --> 54:10.347
I have the same issues
with them.

54:10.347 --> 54:11.849
It didn't work.

54:11.849 --> 54:13.917
Yeah, I just can't get over
the fact that they chose Mariah.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.954
As a team effort,
they didn't help one another.

54:16.954 --> 54:19.823
And listen, when I asked them
who to blame,

54:19.823 --> 54:23.827
they pretty much across
the board said all of them.

54:23.827 --> 54:25.395
But you know what?
They're probably right.

54:25.395 --> 54:26.563
I agree.

54:26.563 --> 54:28.232
All right. Silence.

54:28.232 --> 54:30.467
I've made my decision.

54:30.467 --> 54:33.337
Bring back my girls.

54:33.337 --> 54:35.672
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

54:35.672 --> 54:37.975
I've made some decisions.

54:40.944 --> 54:43.280
Y'all need
to step your pussy up.

54:45.149 --> 54:48.051
For the first time
in Drag Race herstory...

54:51.989 --> 54:54.091
All of you will be
lip syncing for your life.

54:54.091 --> 54:55.626
Oh, my God.

54:57.794 --> 54:59.663
[Scarlet] Holy shit.

54:59.663 --> 55:01.832
I can't breathe.

55:05.002 --> 55:06.570
[Vanjie] Oh, mama is mad,

55:06.570 --> 55:08.272
and all six of y'all
have to pay.

55:10.174 --> 55:13.443
Face...child.

55:15.112 --> 55:19.049
[RuPaul] Six queens
stand before me.

55:19.049 --> 55:20.150
Ladies...

55:20.150 --> 55:23.587
this is your last chance
to impress me

55:23.587 --> 55:27.457
and save yourself
from elimination.

55:29.426 --> 55:31.328
The time has come...
[thunder]

55:31.328 --> 55:33.597
to lip sync...

55:33.597 --> 55:38.268
[echoing] for your life!

55:38.268 --> 55:40.103
[A'Keria] At this point,

55:40.103 --> 55:42.973
I don't know if she's gonna
send three of us home

55:42.973 --> 55:45.475
or if she's gonna
send two home.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.979
My mind is blank.

55:48.979 --> 55:51.548
[Scarlet]
How do I use this stage

55:51.548 --> 55:54.117
without hitting these bitches
in the face?

55:54.117 --> 55:56.220
[Ra'Jah]
If I gotta cut a bitch off,

55:56.220 --> 55:58.388
a bitch is getting cut
right here.

55:58.388 --> 55:59.489
That Tonya Harding moment.

55:59.489 --> 56:01.425
