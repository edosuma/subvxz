00:13.634 --> 00:14.801
This is Bauer.

00:14.867 --> 00:15.967
Jack, Air Traffic Control

00:16.033 --> 00:17.634
just received
a VCI distress signal

00:17.701 --> 00:20.534
from your aircraft
that effectively authorizes

00:20.600 --> 00:22.200
President Logan
to shoot you down.

00:22.267 --> 00:24.600
Start taking us down.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.667
Do it now.

00:26.734 --> 00:29.701
BUCHANAN:
<i>Jack, the F-18</i>
<i>is within 15 miles.</i>

00:29.767 --> 00:32.567
PILOT:
My radar is locked
onto the target.

00:32.634 --> 00:33.667
Lower the landing gear!

00:33.734 --> 00:34.667
We're going too fast!

00:34.734 --> 00:35.801
Touch it down!

00:37.667 --> 00:38.867
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:38.934 --> 00:40.734
( <i>screeching</i> )

00:45.001 --> 00:46.267
We're ready to move Bierko.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.200
Thank you.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.600
<i>I'll be right out.</i>

00:48.667 --> 00:50.534
<i>Vladimir Bierko, </i>
<i>you're being transferred</i>

00:50.600 --> 00:52.233
to a primary holding facility

00:52.300 --> 00:54.134
in our district
headquarters.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.200
Jack, the attorney general
is on his way

00:56.267 --> 00:57.801
to his office
right now.

00:57.867 --> 01:00.434
He'll be ready for
a video conference
in ten minutes.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.967
JACK:
<i>Chloe, I want you to prepare</i>

01:03.034 --> 01:04.200
the recording
for playback.

01:04.266 --> 01:05.200
I want you
to clean it up

01:05.266 --> 01:06.901
and apply
a digital signature

01:06.967 --> 01:08.233
so we can establish
a chain of evidence.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.267
You work alone.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.967
We got the evidence.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.534
President Logan's going to pay

01:12.600 --> 01:14.801
for David Palmer's
assassination.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.967
The spectacle of a sitting
president on trial for murder

01:18.034 --> 01:19.567
would be devastating.

01:19.634 --> 01:21.400
Yes, it would.

01:21.467 --> 01:22.901
<i>If only there were a way that</i>

01:22.967 --> 01:25.367
<i>we could prevent</i>
<i>such a trial from taking place.</i>

01:25.434 --> 01:26.367
( <i>phone rings</i> )

01:26.434 --> 01:27.367
MILES:
<i>Mr. President?</i>

01:27.434 --> 01:28.734
<i>You don't know me.</i>

01:28.801 --> 01:31.001
My name is Miles Papazian,
I work under Karen Hayes.

01:31.068 --> 01:32.767
What is this about?

01:32.834 --> 01:34.500
It's about a recording, sir,

01:34.567 --> 01:39.068
if leaked, could significantly
compromise national security.

01:39.134 --> 01:40.400
Why are you telling me this?

01:40.467 --> 01:42.634
I feel compelled to intervene,

01:42.701 --> 01:44.734
and I just I wanted to make sure

01:44.801 --> 01:46.767
that you would approve.

01:46.834 --> 01:48.101
I do, Mr. Papazian,

01:48.168 --> 01:49.901
I do approve.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.068
Get out of here, Miles.

01:51.134 --> 01:52.901
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.

01:52.967 --> 01:54.967
Well, if your job is
is to slow things down,

01:55.034 --> 01:56.634
then you're doing
really good work.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.667
I'll tell Karen
you'll be ready.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.500
The attorney general
will be on the line
in five minutes.

02:08.567 --> 02:09.901
Did you tell him
that the recording

02:09.967 --> 02:11.967
implicates President Logan
in Palmer's assassination?

02:12.034 --> 02:14.434
No. I feel he needs to hear it
directly from the source.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.400
Fine.

02:26.534 --> 02:27.901
We're minutes away, Chloe,
what's your status?

02:27.967 --> 02:29.300
Everything is set up.

02:29.367 --> 02:31.534
I've got a T-1 line hooked in
to the attorney general,

02:31.600 --> 02:33.834
the other two lines are secured
on dedicated channels.

02:33.901 --> 02:35.300
What other two lines?

02:35.367 --> 02:36.367
We're patching in
a representative

02:36.434 --> 02:37.300
from the House
Judiciary Committee

02:37.367 --> 02:38.300
and a Congressional liaison.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.001
We need their support
to call for

02:40.068 --> 02:41.233
an emergency session
of Congress

02:41.300 --> 02:42.200
to begin impeachment
proceedings.

02:42.267 --> 02:43.233
Impeachment proceedings?

02:43.300 --> 02:44.634
What about an arrest warrant?

02:44.701 --> 02:47.400
We'll never get Justice
to indict a sitting president.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.400
Removing him from office
is a necessary step

02:49.467 --> 02:51.134
to begin full
criminal prosecution.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.001
All right, Chloe,
let's check the sound levels.

02:53.068 --> 02:54.068
Play the recording.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.467
( <i>recording playing</i>
<i>white noise</i> )

03:02.534 --> 03:03.467
What's wrong?

03:03.534 --> 03:04.434
I don't know.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.400
What do you mean
you don't know?

03:05.467 --> 03:06.534
Where's the recording?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.034
This is what's on
the digital medium.

03:08.101 --> 03:09.400
That's impossible.

03:09.467 --> 03:10.901
See if there's an overlay,
check your connections.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.701
There are no mistakes.

03:16.767 --> 03:19.101
Damn it, Chloe,
you were responsible
for this recording.

03:19.168 --> 03:20.101
What the hell happened?

03:20.168 --> 03:21.534
I just told you,
I don't know.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.934
But if there was something
on this memory chip,

03:23.001 --> 03:23.934
it's been erased.

03:24.001 --> 03:25.101
( <i>phone rings</i> )

03:25.168 --> 03:26.367
Yes?

03:26.434 --> 03:27.667
STAFFER:
Excuse me, Ms. Hayes.

03:27.734 --> 03:30.233
The attorney general's
holding on the line.

03:31.701 --> 03:33.300
Ms. Hayes?
I heard you.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.834
Bill Buchanan will
take the call in a moment.

03:34.901 --> 03:36.534
I'll tell him we're having
technical difficulties,

03:36.600 --> 03:38.400
we need to postpone
the conference.

03:38.467 --> 03:39.834
Someone got to
that recording.

03:39.901 --> 03:42.034
Perhaps it was damaged in
your attempts to retrieve it.

03:42.101 --> 03:43.400
It wasn't.

03:43.467 --> 03:45.034
Chloe, who had
access to this room?

03:45.101 --> 03:46.534
No one.
Someone did!

03:46.600 --> 03:48.734
Who had access to this room--
think about it!

03:51.233 --> 03:53.367
Miles was in here.
What?

03:53.434 --> 03:55.068
You sent him in here
to check up on me

03:55.134 --> 03:56.101
while I was setting up.

03:56.168 --> 03:57.534
HAYES:
I never sent him in here!

03:59.667 --> 04:00.667
Jack...

04:07.834 --> 04:10.134
HAYES:
Security, stop Mr. Bauer.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.600
Mr. Bauer!

04:14.634 --> 04:15.767
Jack, don't!

04:18.701 --> 04:19.834
You son of a bitch.

04:19.901 --> 04:21.067
Let go of me, Bauer.

04:21.134 --> 04:22.934
Do you know how many
people lost their lives

04:23.001 --> 04:24.400
so I could bring
that evidence in?

04:24.467 --> 04:25.767
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.267
We know it was you.

04:28.634 --> 04:29.767
Let him go, Jack.

04:30.867 --> 04:31.867
Jack, let him go!

04:36.101 --> 04:37.367
Where are you going, Miles?

04:39.001 --> 04:40.134
I've been transferred.

04:41.068 --> 04:42.600
I was told to report
immediately.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.734
The order should be
coming through any minute.

04:44.801 --> 04:46.333
Transferred to where?

04:49.101 --> 04:50.801
The White House.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.901
How could you do this, Miles?

05:06.068 --> 05:08.333
This is not over.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.400
There will be
an investigation.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.734
Do what you
have to do, Karen...

05:13.001 --> 05:15.467
...but I work for
the president now.

05:30.867 --> 05:32.300
Jack, I'm so sorry.

05:32.367 --> 05:33.667
I don't know how he did it,

05:33.734 --> 05:35.068
he didn't even
touch the recorder.

05:35.134 --> 05:38.667
Karen, Audrey Raines
heard the recording

05:38.734 --> 05:40.034
when I played it
for Secretary Heller.

05:40.101 --> 05:41.400
I know that she will
sign an affidavit...

05:41.467 --> 05:42.667
Jack, not now.

05:42.734 --> 05:45.734
Chloe, take the recorder
down to Processing.

05:45.801 --> 05:47.400
Break down the memory chip
and see if

05:47.467 --> 05:49.567
you can
restore anything.
Fine.

05:49.634 --> 05:50.767
Ms. Hayes?

05:50.834 --> 05:51.801
The president's calling for you.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.134
Line two.

05:56.534 --> 05:57.500
Mr. President.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.767
LOGAN ( <i>over phone</i> ):
Karen,

05:58.834 --> 06:00.500
what's this I hear
about a conference call

06:00.567 --> 06:02.001
you've scheduled
with the attorney general?

06:02.068 --> 06:04.168
Is there some problem
I should know about?

06:04.233 --> 06:05.901
HAYES ( <i>over phone</i> ):
It's nothing, sir,
a mistake.

06:05.967 --> 06:07.767
The conference call
was canceled.

06:08.934 --> 06:11.400
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

06:11.467 --> 06:14.034
Listen, the real reason
for my call is Jack Bauer.

06:14.101 --> 06:15.967
What about Jack Bauer?

06:16.034 --> 06:17.934
I'm embarrassed to say
that after further review,

06:18.001 --> 06:21.267
it appears that the evidence
against him is, at best,

06:21.333 --> 06:22.267
inconclusive.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.300
Now, we'll have our lawyers

06:23.367 --> 06:24.667
continue to work on it,
of course,

06:24.734 --> 06:28.567
but for the time being,
I'm suspending the arrest order.

06:28.634 --> 06:31.300
You're dropping the charges
against Bauer?

06:31.367 --> 06:33.267
That's correct.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.701
Mr. President, you have had
this office, other agencies,

06:35.767 --> 06:37.901
and the military dedicate
all manpower and resources

06:37.967 --> 06:40.200
into apprehending Jack Bauer.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.767
Yes. Based on evidence I
initially thought was credible.

06:43.834 --> 06:46.034
And now I have new information

06:46.101 --> 06:48.734
that's convinced me that
the original intel was faulty.

06:48.801 --> 06:51.534
Am I to release
Bauer, sir?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.267
I'll leave that
to your discretion.

06:53.333 --> 06:56.034
Thank you, Karen.
Good work.

06:56.101 --> 06:58.300
We'll be in touch.

06:58.367 --> 06:59.767
Yes, Mr. President.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.901
He's letting me go
because he knows he's won.

07:06.967 --> 07:08.667
What does he gain
by releasing you?

07:08.734 --> 07:10.267
I'll be on my own.

07:10.333 --> 07:13.101
Alone, unprotected,
a perfect target.

07:13.168 --> 07:15.333
Word just came in--
Bierko's escaped.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.134
What?!

07:16.200 --> 07:17.434
How long ago?!

07:17.500 --> 07:18.967
The convoy that was moving him
to District was hit

07:19.034 --> 07:20.134
about ten minutes ago.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.901
They took out all
our agents except one:

07:21.967 --> 07:23.333
Davis, on line three.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.400
( <i>phone beeps</i> )

07:25.467 --> 07:27.068
Davis, Karen Hayes.
What happened?

07:27.134 --> 07:29.134
Our lead car got taken out
by an IED.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.168
I counted six attackers.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.500
Bierko got away

07:32.567 --> 07:33.801
before I could call in backup.

07:33.867 --> 07:35.101
Did you see the vehicle?

07:35.168 --> 07:37.134
Negative.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.801
I blacked out when I took one
in the shoulder.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.367
There's a medevac team
on the way.

07:40.434 --> 07:41.634
DAVIS ( <i>over speakerphone</i> ):
Before I lost consciousness,

07:41.701 --> 07:44.101
I overheard Bierko
talking to his men.

07:44.168 --> 07:47.233
He said they're
not finished.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.400
"Not finished"?

07:48.467 --> 07:50.567
Yes, ma'am,
I'm certain he said

07:50.634 --> 07:52.101
something about a
nerve gas canister.

07:52.168 --> 07:54.001
Did he say anything else?

07:54.068 --> 07:56.101
I'm sorry, Ms. Hayes,
that's all I heard.

07:56.168 --> 07:57.634
All right, Davis, stand by.

07:57.701 --> 07:59.233
The medical team will
be there in a minute.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.267
Copy that.

08:00.333 --> 08:01.400
Why would Bierko even mention

08:01.467 --> 08:02.834
the Sentox?
I don't know.

08:02.901 --> 08:05.367
I assumed all the canisters
were destroyed in the explosions

08:05.434 --> 08:06.767
at the distribution
center.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.534
How many canisters has
forensics accounted for?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.168
By the time the fires
were put out,

08:10.233 --> 08:12.001
there was not enough left
to do a full accounting.

08:12.068 --> 08:13.400
Damn it.

08:13.467 --> 08:15.667
Bill, raise
an inter-agency
alert.

08:15.734 --> 08:17.300
I need LAPD to do a sweep

08:17.367 --> 08:19.634
of the ambush area
for witnesses.

08:19.701 --> 08:20.600
I want search helicopters.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.101
I want Chloe to have full domain

08:22.168 --> 08:23.967
over surveillance
satellites.

08:24.034 --> 08:26.034
This is priority one--

08:26.101 --> 08:28.333
we have got to find
Vladimir Bierko.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.134
( <i>metal door rattling</i> )

08:32.433 --> 08:35.900
We held one in reserve,
just as you ordered...

08:35.967 --> 08:38.232
but I still don't
understand why.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.134
We can't do much damage

08:45.200 --> 08:47.934
with one canister
of nerve gas.

08:48.001 --> 08:50.001
You're so wrong.

09:49.233 --> 09:50.567
E-Excuse me?

09:50.634 --> 09:52.800
Agent...

09:52.867 --> 09:53.934
It's Agent Cole,
ma'am.
Cole.

09:54.001 --> 09:55.367
I'm sorry, Agent Cole.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.433
My husband said
that Aaron Pierce

09:57.500 --> 09:58.967
had been transferred
to Washington,

09:59.034 --> 10:01.067
and this is
Agent Pierce's phone.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.867
I was wondering
if you'll be so good

10:02.934 --> 10:05.067
as to make sure that
it's returned to him?

10:05.133 --> 10:06.800
Of course.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.233
Was there anything else, ma'am?

10:15.266 --> 10:17.133
No.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.433
There's nothing else.

10:30.101 --> 10:32.867
Oh, my God.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.700
I'm sorry about this, Aaron.

10:54.867 --> 10:57.634
Listen to me, Aaron.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.266
You think you know
what's going on.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.533
( <i>sighs</i> )

11:03.600 --> 11:05.734
I'm here to tell you, you don't.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.967
Then why don't you explain it
to me, Mr. President?

11:09.034 --> 11:12.500
I understand Jack Bauer
led you to believe

11:12.567 --> 11:14.634
that there was a recording--

11:14.700 --> 11:20.433
something that tied me
to David Palmer's murder.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.667
That recording doesn't exist.

11:22.734 --> 11:24.767
That's not what I've been told.

11:24.834 --> 11:28.266
You're not hearing
what I'm saying.

11:28.333 --> 11:33.400
The recording
doesn't exist.

11:33.467 --> 11:37.367
It's over.

11:37.433 --> 11:39.034
You have a choice here, Aaron.

11:39.101 --> 11:42.001
You are a good man.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.166
You're a fine agent.

11:44.233 --> 11:45.967
I see no reason
to throw away your career.

11:46.034 --> 11:50.767
But I need to know
that we can put this behind us.

11:52.767 --> 11:56.200
If you'll give me your word
that you'll let this drop,

11:56.266 --> 11:58.166
I will make sure that
you are reassigned

11:58.233 --> 12:02.233
to whatever post you want.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.333
Except for the White House,
of course.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.333
So...

12:08.400 --> 12:11.101
what's it gonna be, Aaron?

12:11.166 --> 12:13.067
Are my terms acceptable?

12:13.133 --> 12:17.034
There is nothing
that you have said or done

12:17.101 --> 12:21.067
that is acceptable to me
in the least.

12:21.133 --> 12:24.867
You're a traitor to this country
and a disgrace to your office.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.166
And it's my duty to see
that you're brought to justice

12:29.233 --> 12:31.001
for what you've done.

12:31.067 --> 12:34.900
Is there anything else, Charles?

13:14.900 --> 13:16.467
I know Pierce,
Mr. President.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.433
Served with him
for five years.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.233
And his loyalty is
to David Palmer.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.266
Believe me when I tell you,
he's going to be a problem.

13:46.867 --> 13:47.800
( <i>dialing</i> )

13:47.867 --> 13:50.867
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

13:59.667 --> 14:00.867
Mr. President.

14:00.934 --> 14:03.467
I confess, I didn't expect
to hear from you again.

14:03.533 --> 14:05.166
The situation's
changed.

14:05.233 --> 14:06.700
Everything's
under control.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.567
The recording's been destroyed;
it's no longer a problem.

14:09.634 --> 14:12.634
That's very good news,
Mr. President.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.333
But what about the people
who've already heard it?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.233
Can't do anything without proof.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.300
I don't think any further action
needs to be taken.

14:19.367 --> 14:22.200
Then can we assume you've got
the rest of your house in order?

14:22.266 --> 14:24.967
If by that you mean
my wife, yes.

14:25.034 --> 14:27.367
Yes, she's cooperating fully.

14:27.433 --> 14:31.300
As for Aaron Pierce, that's
another matter, but, um...

14:31.367 --> 14:32.433
I'm taking care of that.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.600
Of course.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.001
What about Jack Bauer?

14:36.067 --> 14:38.533
I've already given Karen Hayes
permission to release him,

14:38.600 --> 14:42.400
and the arrangements that we
discussed about taking him out

14:42.467 --> 14:44.001
have already been
set in motion.

14:44.067 --> 14:46.934
It appears you have
everything well in hand,

14:47.001 --> 14:48.133
Mr. President.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.834
Yes, yes.
I said I would handle it,

14:49.900 --> 14:51.333
and I have.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.767
Situation's contained, there's
nothing more to worry about.

14:56.367 --> 14:58.567
I'll call you back.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.834
Mike?

15:03.900 --> 15:05.166
Sir.

15:05.233 --> 15:07.166
What is it, Mike?

15:07.233 --> 15:08.667
I just got off the phone
with Karen Hayes.

15:08.734 --> 15:11.333
Vladimir Bierko has escaped.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.867
What? How?

15:13.934 --> 15:16.533
The caravan transporting him
to District was ambushed.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.767
Damn it!

15:17.834 --> 15:19.967
I thought we rolled CTU
into Homeland Security

15:20.034 --> 15:21.900
just to avoid
screwups like this.

15:21.967 --> 15:23.867
There's more, sir.

15:23.934 --> 15:25.500
They have reason to believe
Bierko might be

15:25.567 --> 15:27.067
readying another
terrorist attack.

15:27.133 --> 15:28.300
What kind of attack?

15:28.367 --> 15:31.333
Well, CTU's working on that now.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.900
I want constant updates.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.734
You keep me apprised
of the progress.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.133
Yes, sir.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.101
Chloe, any luck?

15:48.166 --> 15:49.233
Only the bad kind.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.433
None of these satellites
were positioned

15:50.500 --> 15:51.467
toward the ambush site.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.734
By the time I
queued a redirect,

15:52.800 --> 15:54.034
Bierko and his men
were long gone.

15:54.101 --> 15:55.034
You try CalTrans?

15:55.101 --> 15:56.166
I'm back-streaming now.

15:56.233 --> 15:57.767
So far, I've
come up dry.
Keep trying.

15:57.834 --> 15:59.300
We've got to get
an ID on the vehicle.

15:59.367 --> 16:00.433
I know.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.634
That was LAPD command.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.767
They've combed the area,

16:02.834 --> 16:03.934
but they can't find
any witnesses.

16:04.001 --> 16:05.567
None?
4:00 a.m. in
the middle of

16:05.634 --> 16:07.300
a curfew; there simply
wasn't anyone there.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.500
Then we have nothing.

16:10.634 --> 16:12.700
We've got Henderson.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.266
What about him?
Henderson set up Bierko

16:14.333 --> 16:15.934
with the nerve gas
to begin with.

16:16.001 --> 16:17.634
No, we've already been
down that road.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.166
He won't talk to us,
and you know that.

16:19.233 --> 16:20.467
That was about
protecting Logan.

16:20.533 --> 16:21.800
If Henderson's the
patriot he says he is,

16:21.867 --> 16:23.367
he's not gonna want those
terrorists to succeed.

16:23.433 --> 16:24.600
Trust me,
you're wasting your time.

16:24.667 --> 16:25.600
He's not gonna help us.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.101
He will if we offer him a deal.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.834
That's not gonna happen.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.533
Jack.
No.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.467
Not this time.
Not this man.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.567
We're running
out of options here.

16:35.634 --> 16:38.300
This is about saving lives,
not indulging a grudge.

16:38.367 --> 16:39.667
You think this is
about a grudge?

16:39.734 --> 16:41.266
He killed an ex-President
of the United States.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.900
He tried to kill the
Secretary of Defense.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.934
You want this man to walk
with full immunity?

16:46.001 --> 16:47.034
It's not about
what anyone wants,

16:47.101 --> 16:48.467
it's about doing
what has to be done.

16:48.533 --> 16:49.634
Nobody knows that
better than you.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.967
Bierko is going to
kill innocent people.

16:52.034 --> 16:53.233
Henderson might be
our only chance

16:53.300 --> 16:56.101
to stop him.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.800
Jack...

16:57.867 --> 17:00.233
what would David Palmer want
you to do if he were here?

17:00.300 --> 17:04.467
The best way to honor his
memory is to make the choice

17:04.532 --> 17:06.067
to save others.

17:08.165 --> 17:12.400
Obviously, I can't stop you
from doing this.

17:12.467 --> 17:15.333
If you're gonna give him a deal,
at least let me present it.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.967
All right.

17:18.034 --> 17:19.900
Thank you.

17:45.467 --> 17:46.934
Since you're clearly
no longer a fugitive,

17:47.001 --> 17:49.133
I assume they retrieved
that recording.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.533
Someone got to it
and erased it.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.667
I'm not here to talk
about the recording.

17:53.734 --> 17:55.300
Bierko escaped
about a half an hour ago.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.400
He's gonna carry out

17:56.467 --> 17:58.133
another attack.
I'm sure he will.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.500
You bruised the man's ego when
you stopped his first attempt.

18:00.567 --> 18:02.767
You know him.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.001
You know how he thinks.

18:04.067 --> 18:06.667
You studied him
before you set up this deal.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.967
What's he gonna do?

18:09.034 --> 18:10.433
Why should I help you?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.166
You call yourself
a patriot.

18:12.233 --> 18:13.734
Prove it.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.101
These terrorists
are gonna attack

18:15.166 --> 18:19.034
the country that you love,
because you betrayed them.

18:19.101 --> 18:22.266
Why don't you help me put out
the fire that you started?

18:29.133 --> 18:31.767
They sent you in here
to broker a deal, didn't they?

18:34.300 --> 18:37.266
What's the offer, full immunity?

18:39.567 --> 18:43.433
That just must be
really eating you up inside.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.266
What do you think?

18:45.333 --> 18:46.934
You were responsible
for the murder

18:47.001 --> 18:48.467
of people that I cared about.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.800
I am sorry
about David Palmer, I am.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.433
But what I did
was in the interest

18:52.500 --> 18:53.767
of the destiny of this country.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.800
And I'm not talking about
the version you read on

18:55.867 --> 18:58.067
the op-ed pages pages
ofthe <i>New York Times.</i>

18:58.133 --> 18:59.700
I'm talking about
the politics of survival--

18:59.767 --> 19:01.767
the way the world really works.

19:01.834 --> 19:04.400
Do you want immunity or not?

19:04.467 --> 19:07.467
Immunity is worthless.

19:07.533 --> 19:08.533
Yeah.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.934
( <i>beeping</i> )
Jack.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.133
That recording
was my only immunity.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.567
They give me a piece of paper,

19:19.634 --> 19:21.433
I walk out of here,
I'm a dead man.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.634
It's two days, two hours,
two months, who cares?

19:24.700 --> 19:27.367
They're gonna take me down.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.300
Who's they?

19:29.367 --> 19:31.967
Same people that made Walt
Cummings look like a suicide.

19:32.034 --> 19:33.567
Come on, Jack.

19:33.634 --> 19:35.533
You can't really believe
that Charles Logan

19:35.600 --> 19:37.934
masterminded all of this
by himself.

19:38.001 --> 19:39.300
Give me the names.

19:39.367 --> 19:41.767
You can't touch them.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.300
But they can touch you.

19:47.001 --> 19:48.834
I'll help you catch Bierko.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.834
But not for an immunity deal.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.166
I need something more,

19:52.233 --> 19:54.001
and you're the only person
can make it happen.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.133
What do you want?

19:55.200 --> 19:56.166
To disappear,

19:56.233 --> 19:57.700
just like you did

19:57.767 --> 20:00.133
so they wouldn't turn
you over to the Chinese.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.900
Except, I'm not gonna
make your mistake.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.500
I'm gonna leave the country,
I'm gonna take Miriam with me.

20:04.567 --> 20:05.934
You don't need my
help for that.

20:06.001 --> 20:07.233
Actually, I do.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.967
All of my contacts are still
loyal to the President.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.433
I need somebody I can trust
to cover our tracks.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.700
I need somebody who can do
a better job of it

20:14.767 --> 20:17.101
than those incompetents
who failed to cover yours.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.400
What makes you think
that I'm not gonna kill you

20:19.467 --> 20:21.333
the second this is over?

20:21.400 --> 20:22.400
Because you're
gonna give me

20:22.467 --> 20:24.166
your word.

20:24.233 --> 20:26.400
And I know what your word
is worth to you.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.433
So it's all I need.

20:33.101 --> 20:37.200
Anything less than
Bierko's head on a plate,

20:37.266 --> 20:39.500
this deal is off.

20:39.567 --> 20:41.567
Fine.

20:41.634 --> 20:45.700
Now, Bierko is gonna hit hard,
so you gonna think fast

20:56.167 --> 20:58.200
Chloe, do a phone
check on these 14 names.

20:58.267 --> 21:00.467
I want you working out
of the Situation Room.

21:04.666 --> 21:05.733
What do we have?

21:05.799 --> 21:07.733
Henderson gave us 14 names
that he believes

21:07.799 --> 21:09.267
Bierko's gonna contact first.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.534
Chloe's doing a phone check
and pulling up relative data.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.467
Is Tactical standing by?
They're on priority alert.

21:13.534 --> 21:15.733
I put Curtis Manning in command,
if it's all right with you.

21:15.799 --> 21:18.033
I trust your judgment, Bill.
Security's getting ready

21:18.100 --> 21:21.066
to bring Henderson in here
for a debrief.

21:22.534 --> 21:24.333
Excuse me for one second.

21:27.634 --> 21:28.966
Audrey.

21:30.367 --> 21:32.066
Jack, I just heard
about the recording.

21:32.133 --> 21:33.233
Has it really
been destroyed?

21:33.300 --> 21:35.100
President Logan managed
to get to it.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.567
My God.

21:36.634 --> 21:38.100
We have a more
immediate problem.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.066
Bierko. I heard that he escaped.
That's why I came back out here.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.233
I was hoping that I could help.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.799
Why is Henderson
coming out of Holding?

21:43.866 --> 21:45.600
We're using him

21:45.666 --> 21:47.467
to help us find Bierko.

21:47.534 --> 21:49.433
Audrey, Karen
made a deal.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.966
She gave him immunity.

21:52.033 --> 21:53.833
What?! Jack,
how can you let this happen?

21:53.900 --> 21:55.400
You know what that man has done.

21:55.467 --> 21:56.900
We didn't have a choice.

21:56.966 --> 21:58.634
Bierko's our number
one priority.

21:58.699 --> 22:00.167
We know
he's planning another attack.

22:00.233 --> 22:02.167
Without Henderson's help,
we won't find him.

22:02.233 --> 22:03.367
BUCHANAN:
Jack!

22:03.433 --> 22:05.400
I think we've
got something.

22:06.433 --> 22:08.300
Audrey, I'm sorry.

22:08.367 --> 22:10.534
I've got to go.

22:16.267 --> 22:18.066
CHLOE:
Out of the 14 names on the list,

22:18.133 --> 22:20.500
only one has an active
cell phone-- Joseph Malina.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.233
Joseph Malina's an arms dealer.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.100
Used to be
a military contractor

22:24.167 --> 22:25.733
until they accused him
of selling secrets.

22:25.799 --> 22:26.900
But they couldn't
prove anything,

22:26.966 --> 22:28.300
so he beat
all the charges.

22:28.367 --> 22:29.733
You know him?

22:29.799 --> 22:32.300
Well enough. I did business
with him before and after

22:32.367 --> 22:33.966
he was arrested.
HAYES:
What do you have on him?

22:34.033 --> 22:37.833
Malina got a 12 second call
on his home phone at 4:03 a.m.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.300
from a pay phone in Van Nuys
not far from the ambush site.

22:40.367 --> 22:42.766
A minute later, the same
pay phone got a call-back

22:42.833 --> 22:43.933
from a GSM Sat phone.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.966
In other words, he
took down the number,

22:46.033 --> 22:47.666
called from an
untraceable line.

22:47.733 --> 22:48.966
Sounds like our guy.

22:49.033 --> 22:50.367
Tell Curtis
to mobilize his tactical team.

22:50.433 --> 22:51.534
Hang on, hang on.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.300
What good is that going
to accomplish?

22:53.367 --> 22:55.066
You're going
to bring Malina in here.

22:55.133 --> 22:56.799
You think he's just going
to roll over on Bierko?

22:56.866 --> 22:57.766
He didn't cut a deal

22:57.833 --> 22:58.766
when he was busted before,

22:58.833 --> 23:00.167
he's not gonna cut a deal now.

23:00.233 --> 23:01.666
And even if you can crack him--

23:01.733 --> 23:03.066
I don't think
you can--

23:03.133 --> 23:05.133
you're going to need hours,
and you don't have hours.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.300
What do you suggest?

23:06.367 --> 23:09.233
I suggest you send me in
to talk to Malina.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.233
I'll find out
what Bierko got from him.

23:11.300 --> 23:14.400
I don't think so.
Jack, don't be stupid.

23:14.467 --> 23:16.567
You know you can't get anything
out of this guy,

23:16.634 --> 23:17.866
and his computer makes
this place

23:17.933 --> 23:19.666
look like
an Internet cafe.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.267
He's got the absolute,
most sophisticated,

23:21.333 --> 23:22.966
state-of-the-art
security system,

23:23.033 --> 23:24.933
including a Phoenix Shield.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.133
We can get through it.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.233
Not a Phoenix.
It's a poison pill firewall.

23:28.300 --> 23:29.666
Any attempt
at circumventing it,

23:29.733 --> 23:32.066
and the hard drive does
a cold-start erase,

23:32.133 --> 23:34.200
at which point, you can forget
about retrieving any data.

23:34.267 --> 23:36.400
Take him back to Holding.

23:43.300 --> 23:46.066
I don't think
we have a choice here.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.267
Karen, please, don't do this.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.200
Jack, I know
how you feel,

23:50.267 --> 23:51.400
but Henderson's right.

23:51.467 --> 23:53.467
We can't afford
to gamble on this play.

23:53.534 --> 23:55.467
Damn it, Bill,
you cannot trust this guy.

23:55.534 --> 23:56.900
HAYES:
I agree.

23:56.966 --> 23:58.467
That's why I'm sending you
with him.

23:58.534 --> 24:00.699
I want him under your guard
on a tight leash.

24:00.766 --> 24:02.733
If he tries anything,
I swear to you,

24:02.799 --> 24:04.066
I will kill him.

24:05.534 --> 24:07.500
Then don't let it get
to that point.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.066
* *

24:51.733 --> 24:53.733
* *

25:19.467 --> 25:20.766
Get in.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.500
Adams, listen to me.

25:22.567 --> 25:25.000
You don't have to do this.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.433
Logan isn't worth protecting.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.833
You know that.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.167
He's not going
to get away

25:29.233 --> 25:30.666
with any of this,
and neither will you.

25:30.733 --> 25:32.267
Shut up and get in the trunk.

25:32.333 --> 25:33.634
Use your head.
Logan wants me

25:33.699 --> 25:35.634
dead because he thinks
I know too much,

25:35.699 --> 25:36.900
that I'm a liability.

25:36.966 --> 25:39.267
How soon before
you're just another liability?

25:41.699 --> 25:43.966
( <i>both grunting</i> )

25:44.033 --> 25:45.367
( <i>grunts</i> )

25:45.433 --> 25:47.367
MARTHA:
What are you doing?

25:50.100 --> 25:51.900
Ma'am please stay
where you are.

25:51.966 --> 25:53.900
Aaron?

25:57.233 --> 26:00.233
You're going to shoot me?

26:06.600 --> 26:09.900
I'm the First Lady.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.766
You're going
to shoot the First Lady?

26:16.500 --> 26:17.900
Who are you calling?

26:17.966 --> 26:19.534
Mrs. Logan,
this is my last warning.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.567
( <i>grunts</i> )

26:28.000 --> 26:29.733
( <i>silenced gunshot</i> )

26:34.866 --> 26:37.900
( <i>shallow breathing</i> )

26:39.200 --> 26:42.167
( <i>whimpering</i> )

26:45.433 --> 26:48.267
( <i>crying</i> )

26:48.333 --> 26:50.600
Martha.

26:52.699 --> 26:54.766
Aaron!

26:54.833 --> 26:56.133
( <i>crying</i> )

26:56.200 --> 26:58.900
Aaron, stay with me.

26:58.966 --> 27:01.000
Aaron! Oh, God.

27:01.066 --> 27:04.866
Oh, God, Aaron.

27:19.533 --> 27:23.067
CURTIS:
Jack, we're coming up
on Malina's place.

27:23.133 --> 27:24.666
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

27:24.733 --> 27:27.200
( <i>engine revving</i> )

27:40.700 --> 27:44.766
Curtis, I want you
to set up a perimeter.

27:44.833 --> 27:46.967
I want a man at each
possible escape route.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.033
You got it.
As for you, you
got ten minutes.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.967
You don't get the
intelligence from
Malina by then,

27:51.033 --> 27:52.867
we come through the door,
and we interrogate him.

27:52.933 --> 27:54.800
I'm gonna tell you again, Jack,
interrogating won't work.

27:54.867 --> 27:57.033
This guy won't break.
Then you better hope
your way does.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.133
Get me an audio pack.
Undo your shirt.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.867
Wait a minute.
You can't wire me.

28:00.933 --> 28:03.100
Why not?
Well, think
about it, Jack.

28:03.167 --> 28:04.366
You heard Malina's file.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.100
This guy didn't get where he got
by being careless.

28:06.167 --> 28:08.833
He's got a scanner, frequency
detector, God knows what else.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.933
The second I walk
through that door with a wire,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.633
the bells go off,
this thing's over.

28:15.533 --> 28:18.666
Look, you don't
trust me, fine.

28:18.733 --> 28:21.033
And just so we're straight,
I don't trust you, either,

28:21.100 --> 28:23.666
but neither one of us can afford
to blow this operation.

28:23.733 --> 28:25.334
We're all set. Men
are in position.

28:25.399 --> 28:27.900
No games, Christopher.

28:27.967 --> 28:31.933
I don't need another reason
to put a bullet in your brain.

28:33.466 --> 28:35.234
You got ten minutes.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.433
Have CTU in-monitor
channel 8.

28:43.033 --> 28:44.733
Hold up.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.100
Go.

29:00.499 --> 29:03.633
( <i>beep</i> )

29:11.867 --> 29:13.133
( <i>beep</i> )

29:13.200 --> 29:14.666
Who is it?

29:16.499 --> 29:18.666
What do you want, Chris?

29:18.733 --> 29:19.967
We have to talk.

29:20.033 --> 29:21.800
What, at 4:30 in the morning?

29:21.867 --> 29:24.100
About Vladimir Bierko.

29:24.167 --> 29:27.000
You don't waste my time,
I don't waste your time.

29:27.067 --> 29:30.666
You're going to want to hear
what I have to say.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.833
( <i>buzzer sounds</i> )

29:34.900 --> 29:37.399
( <i>door creaks open</i> )

29:44.700 --> 29:48.499
( <i>panting</i> )

29:52.100 --> 29:55.133

30:12.600 --> 30:14.900
( <i>whirring</i> )

30:21.867 --> 30:24.733
( <i>whirring</i> )

30:29.133 --> 30:31.200
( <i>beep</i> )

30:34.033 --> 30:35.399
( <i>beep</i> )

30:51.533 --> 30:52.700
Hey!

30:52.766 --> 30:54.366
What's so important
it couldn't wait?

30:59.900 --> 31:00.900
What are you
looking for?

31:00.967 --> 31:02.900
Is there another way out
of here?

31:02.967 --> 31:05.100
What the hell are
you talking about?

31:05.167 --> 31:06.399
Jack, I don't like this.

31:06.466 --> 31:07.666
What's Henderson doing?

31:07.733 --> 31:09.234
I don't yet.
Maintain your position.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.100
I repeat,
maintain your position.

31:11.167 --> 31:12.399
Secure-cache the files.

31:12.466 --> 31:13.700
Anything you can't do without.

31:13.766 --> 31:14.766
Why?

31:14.833 --> 31:16.499
Because there
is an entire phalanx

31:16.566 --> 31:18.366
of CTU agents outside,

31:18.433 --> 31:20.533
including an ex-agent
named Jack Bauer.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.234
He's selling us out, Jack.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.499
HENDERSON:
Now, Bauer is running me.

31:23.566 --> 31:25.399
I cut a deal with him,
but I know

31:25.466 --> 31:27.267
this guy's gonna kill me
first chance he gets.

31:27.334 --> 31:28.700
JACK:
Curtis, move your team in now.

31:28.766 --> 31:30.366
All teams, move in now!

31:30.433 --> 31:32.067
You bastard,
you brought him here!

31:32.133 --> 31:33.733
He was coming here anyway.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.433
So secure the files,
crash the system.

31:35.499 --> 31:37.566
Stop wasting time, and do it!

31:47.000 --> 31:48.933
( <i>panting</i> )

31:54.700 --> 31:58.000
( <i>whirring</i> )

32:04.234 --> 32:06.033
( <i>blow torch hissing</i> )

32:11.000 --> 32:14.933
( <i>panting</i> )

32:36.334 --> 32:37.533
Give me a weapon.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.234
( <i>glass shattering in distance</i> )

32:55.300 --> 32:57.167
Freeze! ( <i>yells</i> )

32:59.733 --> 33:01.033
( <i>groans</i> )

33:02.433 --> 33:03.366

33:04.600 --> 33:06.399
( <i>Curtis groans</i> )

33:06.466 --> 33:08.067
Christopher!

33:08.133 --> 33:10.733
Let me see your hands! Now!

33:11.766 --> 33:15.167
Slowly stand up.

33:15.234 --> 33:17.366
Put the weapon
on the counter.

33:19.566 --> 33:21.167
Step back.

33:24.733 --> 33:26.399
Curtis,
how are your men?

33:26.466 --> 33:27.867
CURTIS:
My men are fine.

33:27.933 --> 33:29.433
I've been hit,
but I'm okay.

33:29.499 --> 33:31.366
Call in medical;
get him transferred back to CTU.

33:31.433 --> 33:32.666
What's Malina's condition?

33:32.733 --> 33:33.700
Gunshot to the hip.

33:33.766 --> 33:34.666
He's losing blood.

33:34.733 --> 33:36.499
Stabilize him,
keep him alive.

33:36.566 --> 33:37.533
I had him, Jack.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.100
30 more seconds
was all I needed.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.167
You played me.

33:40.234 --> 33:41.700
This is over;
you're going back.

33:41.766 --> 33:43.200
No, you blew it, Jack.

33:43.267 --> 33:44.766
What are you talking about?

33:44.833 --> 33:47.466
I got him to life the firewall,
and he was about to dump

33:47.533 --> 33:49.100
all of his files
onto a flash drive

33:49.167 --> 33:51.100
before you jumped the
gun and busted in here.

33:51.167 --> 33:53.133
Now you're going to waste a hell
of a lot of time

33:53.200 --> 33:55.700
trying to decrypt those
files off a mainframe,

33:55.766 --> 33:57.733
so you'd better pray there's
something on there you can read.

33:59.766 --> 34:01.566
Cuff him.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.300
Bill, this is Jack.

34:04.366 --> 34:05.900
Get Chloe to open up a channel.

34:05.967 --> 34:08.300
I'm going to send you some files
from Malina's computer.

34:08.366 --> 34:09.600
I'm on it, Jack.

34:09.666 --> 34:11.433
Chloe, I need you
to access these files,

34:11.498 --> 34:13.167
find out which ones were opened
in the last ten minutes.

34:13.234 --> 34:15.366
They'll tell us
what Malina sold Bierko.

34:15.433 --> 34:16.666
They're coming through now--
hang on.

34:16.733 --> 34:18.867
Bill, Curtis was hit--
he's stable,

34:18.933 --> 34:20.533
but I'm having him transported
back to CTU.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.000
All right, Jack,
I'll tell Medical.

34:22.067 --> 34:23.699
Send a chopper
over to this location.

34:23.766 --> 34:25.498
As soon as we know
what Bierko's target is,

34:25.565 --> 34:26.900
we're going to need
to move fast.

34:26.967 --> 34:28.565
Okay, I got through
the firewall.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.399
It's still going to take me
some time to decrypt the files.

34:30.466 --> 34:32.300
Chloe, just do it as quickly
as you can.

34:32.366 --> 34:33.933
Bierko's going to release
the Sentox gas soon.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.433
We need to know where.

34:35.498 --> 34:36.833
There, you should
have everything.

34:36.900 --> 34:37.933
Let's go.

34:49.766 --> 34:52.734
Aaron?

34:52.801 --> 34:54.033
Charles lied to me.

34:54.100 --> 34:56.467
He said you'd been transferred
to Washington.

34:58.500 --> 35:03.333
That agent, um...

35:03.400 --> 35:06.400
Adams,

35:06.467 --> 35:09.267
my husband ordered him
to kill you, didn't he?

35:09.333 --> 35:11.734
Yes, ma'am.

35:13.767 --> 35:15.400
But I'm sorry
to tell you...

35:15.467 --> 35:19.267
the president was involved with
much worse things than that.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.801
I know.

35:25.867 --> 35:29.534
I was going to let him
get away with it... all of it.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.133
I was going to keep quiet.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.534
We have to do something.

35:37.600 --> 35:41.867
I'll hide the body,
get him in the trunk,

35:41.933 --> 35:43.634
but I can't drive it
out of here.

35:43.700 --> 35:47.434
The president has to believe
that I'm dead.

35:47.500 --> 35:50.734
I need to lay low,
keep out of sight.

35:50.801 --> 35:52.267
I can do it.

35:52.333 --> 35:55.000
No. No.
Yes, Aaron, I can drive it.

35:55.066 --> 35:58.467
No, you need to get back
inside the residence.

35:58.534 --> 36:02.600
Your husband can't suspect
that anything has gone wrong.

36:02.667 --> 36:04.667
You need to find Mike Novick.

36:04.734 --> 36:07.434
Mike?

36:07.500 --> 36:10.033
Tell him everything.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.233
And tell him
to meet me here.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.267
Okay.

36:15.333 --> 36:20.367
Aaron, promise me...

36:20.434 --> 36:24.867
promise me that
if something goes wrong

36:24.933 --> 36:27.333
and you're in danger
of getting caught,

36:27.400 --> 36:29.400
you will find a way
off these grounds,

36:29.467 --> 36:32.901
and you will leave.

36:32.966 --> 36:34.700
Promise me.

36:34.767 --> 36:38.167
You have my word.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.867
Secure him
by the tailgate.

37:09.867 --> 37:11.734
( <i>dialing</i> )

37:11.801 --> 37:14.233
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

37:14.300 --> 37:15.534
Buchanan.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.567
Bill, it's Jack.

37:16.634 --> 37:17.700
How is Chloe doing
with the files?

37:17.767 --> 37:19.100
Almost there, Jack.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.467
Okay, I got it.

37:20.534 --> 37:22.734
Wait, there's something more.

37:23.901 --> 37:27.734
Classified defense contracts
and plans.

37:27.801 --> 37:30.933
It's a Russian submarine, Jack.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.400
The <i>Natalia-K524,</i>
Delta-IV class.

37:34.467 --> 37:36.400
It's here for inspection
by our navy.

37:36.467 --> 37:39.100
Why is the U.S. Navy inspecting
a Russian submarine?

37:39.167 --> 37:41.500
It's part of the treaty
that President Logan

37:41.567 --> 37:43.066
and President Suvarov signed.

37:43.133 --> 37:45.200
There's a provision that calls
for the sharing of technology.

37:45.267 --> 37:46.600
Where is it docked?

37:46.667 --> 37:48.133
Docking Station 8.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.333
It's a non-military shipyard
at the Port of Los Angeles.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.767
I'll deploy TAC teams
to the port.

37:51.834 --> 37:52.933
Good.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.167
Chloe, hold on.

37:55.233 --> 37:58.000
What's the armament package
on a Russian Delta IV-class sub?

37:58.066 --> 38:01.233
Best of my knowledge, 12
Scorpion land attack missiles.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.434
Are they nuclear?

38:02.500 --> 38:03.901
No, but they're fast
and accurate.

38:03.966 --> 38:05.200
ey carry multiple warheads.

38:05.267 --> 38:07.100
One could take out
several city blocks.

38:07.167 --> 38:08.467
( <i>helicopter propeller</i>
<i>whirring</i> )

38:08.534 --> 38:09.534
Uncuff him.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.233
Karen, it's Jack.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.400
Are you still there?

38:12.467 --> 38:13.434
Yes, Jack, I'm here.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.133
Okay, I need you
to put me in touch

38:15.200 --> 38:17.567
with the ranking U.S. officer
on the <i>Natalia.</i>

38:17.634 --> 38:20.434
We need to get them to lock out
their onboard weapons systems!

38:20.500 --> 38:22.534
All right, I'll have Audrey
call DOD

38:22.600 --> 38:24.367
and open a priority line
to the sub,

38:24.434 --> 38:25.467
and she'll get back to you.

38:25.534 --> 38:27.267
Okay, thank you.

38:27.333 --> 38:28.634
You're coming with me.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.600
I found Bierko's
target for you.

38:30.667 --> 38:32.534
The deal was Bierko's head
on a plate.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.901
What do you want me to do
now-- kill him for you?!

38:35.000 --> 38:36.300
The only reason
you're going with me

38:36.367 --> 38:38.634
is 'cause you know
the weapons systems.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.033
Go!

38:54.867 --> 38:56.133
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

38:56.200 --> 38:57.600
This is Bauer.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.567
Jack, I've got the U.S. Navy's
ranking officer

38:59.634 --> 39:01.267
on board the <i>Natalia--</i>
I'm putting you through.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.267
Okay, Audrey,
stay on the line.

39:03.333 --> 39:05.467
All right, Jack, hold on.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.933
AUDREY:
Lieutenant Southern,
you're on with Jack Bauer.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.801
Agent Bauer, what is this about?

39:11.867 --> 39:13.000
JACK:
Lieutenant,
we believe the <i>Natalia</i>

39:13.066 --> 39:15.000
has been targeted for
a terrorist attack.

39:15.066 --> 39:16.667
You need to
secure your vessel

39:16.734 --> 39:18.333
and lock down your weapons
systems immediately.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.467
Ski!

39:19.534 --> 39:21.066
Call all hands,
set Condition Delta,

39:21.133 --> 39:22.200
seal the bridge

39:22.267 --> 39:23.400
and aft hatches.

39:23.467 --> 39:25.467
Aye, sir.
You need to put
your men on alert.

39:25.534 --> 39:26.767
There's a threat
to your submarine.

39:26.834 --> 39:28.567
( <i>speaking Russian</i> )

39:30.133 --> 39:32.233
Now, what is the nature
of this threat?

39:32.300 --> 39:34.333
We think the terrorists are
after your missiles on the sub.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.267
I'm going to check right now.

39:54.933 --> 39:56.467
Sailor! I've got that.

39:56.534 --> 39:57.767
Report aft.

40:03.534 --> 40:04.734
Bauer.

40:04.801 --> 40:06.200
I'm checking topside.

40:17.133 --> 40:18.667
Lieutenant!

40:18.734 --> 40:19.901
Damn it, Audrey, I've lost him.

40:19.966 --> 40:21.000
Notify DOD.

40:21.066 --> 40:22.200
All right, Jack, I'm on it.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.434
Captain, how far out
are we?

40:54.500 --> 40:56.901
Just over five minutes, sir.

41:30.634 --> 41:32.700
( <i>device beeps</i> )

41:47.500 --> 41:49.867
( <i>typing</i> )

41:49.933 --> 41:51.600
Read me the code
we got from Malina.

41:51.667 --> 41:53.367
PETROV:
"Alpha 255

41:53.434 --> 41:54.867
Tango Romeo 99."

41:54.966 --> 41:58.600
( <i>beeps</i> )

42:01.300 --> 42:04.267
We have control
of the weapons system.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.300
Are the missiles loaded?

42:08.300 --> 42:11.066
Vertical tubes are loaded
and ready.

42:11.133 --> 42:12.933
Loading horizontal tubes now.
