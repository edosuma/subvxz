WEBVTT

00:07.175 --> 00:10.044
OKAY, CHARLIE,
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WHEN YOU GET IN TROUBLE?

00:10.078 --> 00:13.081
UH-OH.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.349
OH, CHARLIE JUST MADE
AN UH-OH?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.518
I JUST CHANGED YOU.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.289
NO, CHARLIE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I'M JUST SAMPLING HER.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.557
"SAMPLING" MEANS I'M RECORDING
ALL THE WORDS SHE SAYS

00:23.591 --> 00:25.359
SO I CAN PLAY THEM BACK.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.461
OH, WE USED TO
DO THAT.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.497
WE CALLED IT
TAPE-RECORDING.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.831
CHECK IT OUT.

00:30.864 --> 00:35.503
Mine, yes, no,
cookie, nana.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.272
DAD, YOU PROMISED YOU'D
TAKE ME DRIVING TODAY.

00:38.306 --> 00:41.809
TO BE FAIR,
I PROMISE A LOT OF THINGS
I DON'T DELIVER ON.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.179
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
KEEP PUTTING THIS OFF.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.548
MY DRIVER'S TEST
IS IN THREE DAYS, AND YOU
HAVEN'T TAKEN ME OUT ONCE.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.583
NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU EXPLAINED IT ALL TO ME

00:49.617 --> 00:53.521
WHILE I WAS TRYING
TO READ IN THE BATHROOM.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.190
YOU WERE OUTSIDE THE DOOR
WHILE DAD WAS
IN THE BATHROOM?

00:56.224 --> 00:58.626
THAT'S HOW MUCH
I WANT IT.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.528
BOB, TAKE HER DRIVING
ALREADY.

01:00.561 --> 01:04.432
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
LET'S GO.

01:04.465 --> 01:09.137
BOY, I TELL YOU,
NOTHING GOOD EVER HAPPENS
WHEN I LEAVE THE BATHROOM.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.406
Bye-bye.
Bye-- bye-- bye-bye.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.542
- WHAT'S THAT?
- JUST IN CASE
YOU DON'T MAKE IT BACK.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.647
( rock music playing )

01:19.680 --> 01:21.482
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

01:21.515 --> 01:23.151
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

01:23.184 --> 01:25.453
* HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE? *

01:25.486 --> 01:27.621
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

01:27.655 --> 01:29.457
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

01:29.490 --> 01:32.360
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

01:32.393 --> 01:35.563
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

01:35.596 --> 01:38.666
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

01:38.699 --> 01:41.135
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:41.169 --> 01:42.536
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

01:42.570 --> 01:45.506
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

01:45.539 --> 01:47.575
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:47.608 --> 01:49.277
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

01:49.310 --> 01:52.180
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

01:52.213 --> 01:54.548
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

01:54.582 --> 01:57.685
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

01:57.718 --> 02:02.190
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

02:03.491 --> 02:06.260
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.572
P.J., WHAT DID YOU GET
TEDDY FOR HER BIRTHDAY?

02:18.606 --> 02:22.610
- BIRTHDAY?
- YOUR SISTER'S TURNING 16.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.678
WE'RE HAVING A SURPRISE PARTY
FOR HER TONIGHT.

02:24.712 --> 02:28.682
WELL, IT'S WORKING,
'CAUSE I'M SURPRISED.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.652
THE PARTY STARTS
AT 7:00.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.654
YOU HAVE TO GET HER A PRESENT,
AND SOMETHING NICE.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.757
- HOW ABOUT--?
- NOT ANOTHER SOCK PUPPET.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.228
YOU HAVE TO GET HER
SOMETHING TOO.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.696
WHOA WHOA, WHAT DID I
JUST WALK INTO?

02:42.730 --> 02:45.699
MOM SAYS WE HAVE TO BUY TEDDY
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.736
WHAT ABOUT A DOG?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.704
I BET
SHE'D LIKE A DOG.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.374
I'M SERIOUS.
YOU HAVE TO GET HER SOMETHING.

02:53.407 --> 02:57.678
WHAT ABOUT A DOG?
I BET SHE'D LIKE A DOG.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.982
GABE, IS THERE A DOG
IN MY HOUSE?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.685
( dog barks )

03:04.718 --> 03:06.254
MAYBE.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.626
HE FOLLOWED ME HOME, MOM.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.595
CAN WE KEEP HIM?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.630
NO. I'VE TOLD YOU
100 TIMES

03:16.664 --> 03:18.599
I DO NOT WANT A DOG
IN THIS HOUSE.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.268
MOM, PLEASE.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.769
HORSY.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.306
NO, HONEY.
IT'S ACTUALLY A DOGGIE.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.778
WHO JUST MADE
A HORSY-SIZED UH-OH.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.789
SORRY, TEDDY.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION
AND IT'S FINAL.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.258
DAD, THAT'S SO UNFAIR.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.026
MOM, DAD SAYS
I CAN'T GET MY LICENSE.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.662
- WHAT? WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE SHE'S NOT READY.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.699
WELL, MY DRIVING
INSTRUCTOR THINKS I AM.
HE SAYS I'M DOING GREAT.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.701
THE MAN WORKS
FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.003
HE'S GOT NOTHING
TO LIVE FOR.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.539
MOM, CAN YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.541
TEDDY HONEY,
I'M SORRY,

04:00.574 --> 04:04.778
BUT YOUR FATHER HAS
A VERY SMALL AREA
OF AUTHORITY...

04:06.814 --> 04:08.816
AND UNFORTUNATELY
FOR YOU,

04:08.849 --> 04:11.319
TEACHING YOU KIDS TO DRIVE
IS PART OF IT.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.823
SO WHAT ELSE IS
IN THAT AREA?

04:15.856 --> 04:19.427
BARBECUING.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.829
THAT'S IT.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.498
DAD, PLEASE.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.767
I REALLY WANT
TO GET MY LICENSE
THE DAY I TURN 16.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.503
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, ALL RIGHT?

04:29.537 --> 04:32.306
SO UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE,
THERE'S GONNA BE NO DRIVING.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.776
SORRY. CAN I HAVE
THE KEYS, PLEASE?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.645
HERE.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.280
I CAN'T BELIEVE I STOOD
OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM DOOR
FOR THIS.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.660
HEY.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.628
YOU'RE ON MY SIDE,
RIGHT?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.832
- HONEY.
- YEAH?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.901
WHY AM I TALKING
TO A DOG?

05:02.636 --> 05:05.573
HE FOLLOWED GABE HOME.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.608
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I MADE IT VERY CLEAR

05:07.641 --> 05:09.610
WE ARE NOT KEEPING HIM.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.613
HEY, YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
HE KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF YOUR UNCLE STAN.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.782
- WHAT?
- THE WET NOSE
AND THE BLOODSHOT EYES.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.518
COME ON, HE--

05:17.551 --> 05:19.853
OH, NOW I SEE IT.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.759
P.J., I HAVE A QUESTION.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.496
WAS DAD OUT OF CONTROL
WHEN HE WAS TEACHING YOU
HOW TO DRIVE?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.664
NO NO, HE WAS
VERY MELLOW.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.700
THEN WHAT IS
HIS PROBLEM?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.902
WELL, HAIR LOSS,
KILLS BUGS FOR A LIVING--

05:34.935 --> 05:37.905
THERE'S SO MUCH
TO CHOOSE FROM.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.808
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
WHY DID HE HAVE TO
TAKE IT OUT ON ME?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.777
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE YOU'RE A BAD DRIVER.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.380
NO, I'M A GOOD DRIVER.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.115
I WAS THE ONLY KID
IN DRIVER'S ED

05:48.148 --> 05:50.718
WHO DIDN'T BARF DURING
THE SPLATTERED BRAINS MOVIE.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.654
ACTUALLY I HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.791
I HAVE A FRIEND
WHO IS TURNING 16

05:57.825 --> 06:00.394
AND I HAVE TO BUY HER
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

06:00.428 --> 06:04.665
MM, WELL, I KNOW YOUR FRIEND
WOULDN'T WANT A SOCK PUPPET.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.800
OKAY.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.702
WELL, WHAT WOULD
SHE WANT?

06:08.736 --> 06:11.505
WELL,

06:11.539 --> 06:13.541
SHE'D PROBABLY
LIKE BOOTS,

06:13.574 --> 06:15.543
LIKE FROM THAT
COOL STORE AT THE MALL,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.578
BUT NOT THE BLACK ONES
WITH THE PURPLE TRIM.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.580
SHE ALREADY HAS THOSE.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.649
I'M JUST GUESSING.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.557
( doorbell rings )

06:34.495 --> 06:36.764
OH HI, MRS. DABNEY.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.700
I SEE YOU PEOPLE
HAVE A DOG NOW.

06:41.001 --> 06:44.905
OH, I'M DOING FINE, THANKS.
HOW ARE YOU?

06:44.938 --> 06:47.475
LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.543
YOUR DOG MAKES
MY CAT NERVOUS.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.646
AND WHEN MY CAT
GETS NERVOUS,
I GET NERVOUS.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.516
AND WHEN I GET NERVOUS,
MR. DABNEY GETS NERVOUS.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.818
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

06:57.851 --> 07:01.522
MR. DABNEY GOES
TO STAY WITH HIS MOTHER.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.958
SO THIS DOG THING
IS NOT ENTIRELY BAD.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.960
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE DONE HERE.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.863
OH, MRS. DABNEY,
BEFORE YOU GO,

07:09.897 --> 07:13.000
UM, I NEED SOME MORE
PRACTICE HOURS

07:13.033 --> 07:14.868
BEFORE I TAKE
MY DRIVER'S TEST,

07:14.902 --> 07:17.471
SO IF YOU EVER
NEED A CHAUFFEUR,
I'M YOUR GIRL.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.739
LET'S GO.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.577
RIGHT NOW?

07:23.611 --> 07:25.579
I'VE GOT A BUNCH
OF ERRANDS TO RUN.

07:25.613 --> 07:29.249
AND IF YOU DRIVE,
I CAN PLAY WORD JUMBLE
ON MY CELL PHONE.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.686
ACTUALLY I DO THAT ANYWAY,
BUT THIS WAY IT'S LEGAL.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.895
THIS STORE ONLY HAS
GIRLS IN IT.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.964
YEAH.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.935
SO WHAT'S TEDDY'S
SHOE SIZE?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.770
I DON'T KNOW.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.271
YOU DON'T KNOW
HER SHOE SIZE?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.907
I DON'T KNOW
HER MIDDLE NAME.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.645
WELL, DUDE, HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO BUY HER SHOES?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.680
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.050
TEDDY WORE YOUR SNEAKERS
BY MISTAKE LAST WEEK, RIGHT?

08:03.083 --> 08:06.654
- YES.
- THAT MEANS
YOU'RE THE SAME SIZE.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.623
HERE, TRY THESE ON.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.692
OH NO.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.727
I AM NOT PUTTING ON
GIRL BOOTS.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.663
OH, COME ON.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.599
THEY'LL LOOK GOOD WITH THAT
GIRL SHIRT YOU'RE WEARING.

08:18.632 --> 08:22.770
IT'S NOT A PONY.
IT'S A STALLION.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.608
FINE, I'LL PUT THEM ON
FOR TWO SECONDS.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.313
BUYING BOOTS
FOR MY SISTER.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.984
FUNNY STORY--
SHE AND MY BROTHER
HAVE THE SAME SIZE FEET.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.887
GOOD THING SHE DIDN'T WANT
UNDERWEAR, RIGHT?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.856
OKAY, SEE YOU.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.060
OKAY, THEY FIT.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.029
WHOA, HOLD ON, DUDE.
YOU'VE GOTTA STAND UP,

08:49.062 --> 08:52.633
WALK AROUND, MAKE SURE
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.702
COME ON.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.977
WOW, THOSE DO WONDERS
FOR YOUR LEGS.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.780
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.654
THEY WON'T COME OFF.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.022
WHAT?
LET ME TRY.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.997
WHY ARE YOUR FEET
SO FAT?

09:24.031 --> 09:27.100
THEY'RE NOT FAT.
THEY'RE HUSKY.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.137
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.940
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.942
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING?
- NO ONE.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.577
I'M TAKING A PICTURE
OF YOU IN GIRL BOOTS.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.020
THE LIGHT'S NOT GETTING
ANY GREENER.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.690
I KNOW, BUT THE CAR
IN FRONT OF ME
HASN'T MOVED YET.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.058
HERE'S A QUICK
DRIVING LESSON.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.060
( honks horn )

09:53.093 --> 09:55.696
WAKE UP, GRANDPA!

09:55.729 --> 09:59.633
SORRY, THAT WAS HER,
NOT ME.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.902
OH LOOK,
GRANDPA'S TELLING US
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.738
NO, HE'S NOT.
HE'S--

10:04.772 --> 10:07.174
I KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.743
( phone bleeping )

10:09.777 --> 10:12.112
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY
HEAD HOME NOW, RIGHT?

10:12.145 --> 10:15.082
JUST ONE MORE STOP-- BOULDER.
I WANT TO SEE MY SISTER.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.184
BOULDER?
THAT'S IN THE MOUNTAINS.

10:17.217 --> 10:21.121
OH, YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE
FLAT-LAND-ONLY
DRIVING PERMITS?

10:21.154 --> 10:25.125
NO, IT'S JUST
I HAVE TO BE HOME BY 7:00.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.728
OH, AND WE SHOULD
PROBABLY STOP FOR GAS.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.197
IN THIS CAR YOU CAN DRIVE
100 MILES ON EMPTY.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.165
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN WE NEED GAS.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.234
( engine sputtering )

10:36.103 --> 10:38.171
NOW WE NEED GAS.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.075
YEAH, JUST ONE
PROBLEM--

10:42.109 --> 10:44.077
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.680
( thunder crashing )

10:46.714 --> 10:48.682
AND IT LOOKS
LIKE RAIN.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.150
AGH!

10:50.183 --> 10:52.219
AND THERE'S A CRAZY WOMAN
OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.

10:52.252 --> 10:57.057
SO ACTUALLY
WE GOT THREE PROBLEMS.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.473
HELLO.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.977
KINDA HARD TO TALK
WITH THE WINDOW OPEN
JUST A CRACK.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.012
SORRY.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.452
WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING
OVER HERE?

11:25.485 --> 11:26.887
WE'RE OUT OF GAS.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.889
WELL, THIS IS
YOUR LUCKY DAY.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.824
THERE'S GAS AND SUCH
DOWN THE ROAD A SPELL.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.125
OH, HOW FAR IS
A SPELL?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.127
50 MILES.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.929
OF COURSE, I GOT
A GALLON OF GAS
RIGHT HERE.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.931
GREAT.
HOW MUCH IS IT?

11:37.965 --> 11:39.900
50 BUCKS.

11:41.068 --> 11:44.204
THE MOUNTAIN LADY'S
GOT AN ANGLE.

11:44.237 --> 11:48.809
I ALSO GOT GUM,
MINTS, MAGAZINES.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.945
I COULD KEEP YOU UP TO DATE
ON ALL THINGS JUSTIN BIEBER.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.922
OH.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.024
CHARLIE.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.059
CHARLIE, HAND MOMMY
THE TAPE.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.263
FINE.

12:10.297 --> 12:13.300
IT'LL JUST BE
A "SWEET 6" PARTY.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.969
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?

12:16.003 --> 12:18.005
ARE YOU MAKING
A PRETTY PICTURE?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.978
WHAT DO YOU WANT, DOG?

12:25.012 --> 12:26.947
HORSY.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.949
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:28.982 --> 12:32.185
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CANNOT BE HERE.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.324
YOU'RE KIND OF SWEET.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.759
OKAY, JUST FOR A MINUTE.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.332
YOU'RE NOT SUCH
A BAD DOG, ARE YOU?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.935
NO, YOU'RE A GOOD DOG.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.970
I'M GONNA CALL YOU
SWEETIE-PIE

12:50.003 --> 12:53.006
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A SWEETIE-PIE.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.008
- MOMMY.
- CHARLIE, NOT NOW.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.044
YES.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.983
MOM, WE HAVE GOT
A BIG PROBLEM.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.985
OH, YOU SURE DO.

13:05.018 --> 13:08.088
THOSE BOOTS DO NOT GO
WITH THOSE SHORTS.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.993
YOU ARE WORKING
MY LAST NERVE.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.134
SHE IS A HANDFUL.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.274
DOES ANY OF THIS
LOOK FAMILIAR?

13:27.307 --> 13:30.911
LOOKS LIKE THE SAME ROAD
WE DROVE DOWN 10 MINUTES AGO.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.013
SO I'M JUST
GOING IN CIRCLES

13:33.046 --> 13:35.048
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING?

13:35.082 --> 13:39.152
I THOUGHT MY ANNOYED SILENCE
WAS SPEAKING VOLUMES.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.121
OKAY.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.123
WELL, WE'RE LOST

13:43.156 --> 13:45.292
AND WE NEED
TO LOOK AT A MAP.
DO YOU HAVE A MAP?

13:45.325 --> 13:49.162
ON MY CELL PHONE.
BUT I'D HAVE TO TURN OFF
MY WORD JUMBLE.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.365
OKAY.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.102
( engine revving )

13:56.904 --> 13:58.872
WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

13:58.906 --> 14:01.374
I THINK WE'RE
IN SOME KIND OF HOLE.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.111
WELL, THEN ONE OF US
IS GONNA HAVE TO
GET OUT AND PUSH--

14:04.144 --> 14:06.613
THE ONE OF US
WHO'S 16.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.950
I'M NOT 16 YET.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.985
- GET OUT.
- OKAY.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.963
OKAY, HIT IT,
BUT TRY TO GO...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.036
SLOW.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.641
OKAY, GO AGAIN,
BUT THIS TIME

14:34.674 --> 14:36.476
TRY TO GO
A LITTLE BIT SLOWER.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.313
( fabric rips )

14:42.249 --> 14:43.416
OH.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.687
WELL, THIS WOULD BE
A GREAT TIME

14:47.720 --> 14:50.991
FOR THE MOUNTAIN LADY
TO COME BY WITH SOME SKIRTS.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.395
( doorbell rings )

14:55.428 --> 14:57.464
HEY, SWEETIE.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.102
- HI.
- HI.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.938
I THINK YOU FOUND MY DOG.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.008
UM, WE DON'T HAVE
A DOG HERE.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.944
REALLY?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.947
I FOUND THIS FLYER
WITH YOUR ADDRESS ON IT.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.984
MUST BE A MISPRINT.
NO DOG. BYE-BYE.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.352
MOM, MOM, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

15:19.386 --> 15:22.355
HI, WE'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.491
OKAY.

15:24.524 --> 15:28.228
LOOK, MOM, WE'VE GOT TO DO
THE RIGHT THING HERE.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.365
IF YOU WANT A DOG,
WE CAN GET YOU ANOTHER ONE.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.234
I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER DOG.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.270
I WANT
MY SWEETIE-PIE.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.107
MOM, HE ALREADY HAS
A FAMILY

15:40.140 --> 15:42.275
WHO LOVES HIM
AND MISSES HIM.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.278
HE NEEDS
TO GO HOME.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.281
I KNOW.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.987
GOODBYE, SWEETIE-PIE.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.289
I WILL NEVER
FORGET YOU.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.300
WINSTON!

16:07.334 --> 16:09.236
THANK YOU.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.337
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:19.279 --> 16:23.283
I'M VERY VERY
PROUD OF YOU.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.485
NOW HOW ABOUT WE GO
GET YOU SOME ICE CREAM?

16:25.518 --> 16:28.155
- OKAY.
- YES, COME ON.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.168
OH, YOU GUYS,
TEDDY'S HERE.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.403
EVERYBODY HIDE.
HIDE.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.343
SURPRISE!

16:50.377 --> 16:52.212
AWW.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.817
OH, OKAY.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.587
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING--

17:00.620 --> 17:04.624
TEDDY CAN WEAR
ANYTHING.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.296
OH, UM...

17:09.329 --> 17:12.065
WHY DON'T I GO
CLEAN UP

17:12.099 --> 17:14.234
AND WE'LL TRY THIS AGAIN
IN 30 MINUTES, OKAY?

17:14.267 --> 17:17.270
OH, ONE MORE THING--
YOU GUYS!

17:25.345 --> 17:28.081
- GREAT CAKE, MOM.
- I GOT IT AT THE STORE.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.084
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I SAID
"GREAT CAKE, MOM."

17:35.322 --> 17:37.490
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

17:37.524 --> 17:41.161
JUST THINKING.
ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR PARTY?

17:41.194 --> 17:43.496
YEAH, IT'S AWESOME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.235
DAD, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.238
YOU SPENT THE AFTERNOON
DRIVING WITH MRS. DABNEY.

17:51.271 --> 17:55.375
YOU GOT ALL THAT FROM
"I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING"?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.844
NO, ACTUALLY
I GOT ALL THAT

17:57.877 --> 18:01.281
FROM WHEN MRS. DABNEY
RETURNED YOUR SKIRT.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.119
NOW YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT YOU DRIVING.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.887
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.656
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:09.689 --> 18:11.658
LET'S JUST TALK
ABOUT THIS TOMORROW.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.660
- DAD, I'M A REALLY
GOOD DRIVER.
- TEDDY.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.396
NO, WHY ARE YOU TREATING ME
DIFFERENT THAN P.J.?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.665
YOU DIDN'T FREAK OUT ON HIM
WHEN HE WAS LEARNING
HOW TO DRIVE.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.268
BECAUSE TEACHING P.J.
TO DRIVE WAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT THING.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.136
- WHY?
- BECAUSE IT WAS.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.538
- WHY?
- BECAUSE HE'S P.J.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.107
YOU'RE MY LITTLE GIRL.

18:32.679 --> 18:36.649
DRIVING MEANS LEAVING.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.552
AND ONCE YOU GET
IN THAT CAR,

18:39.586 --> 18:43.390
YOU GO.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.429
DAD.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.466
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.468
YOU'VE GOT YOUR PARTY
AND STUFF GOING ON.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.437
I SHOULD BE TALKING
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.439
DAD, IT'S SAD TO THINK

18:59.472 --> 19:01.441
ALL YOUR KIDS ARE GONNA
LEAVE SOMEDAY.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.676
WELL, ACTUALLY TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST,

19:03.710 --> 19:05.678
WITH P.J.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.481
I'M KIND OF WORRIED
HE'S NEVER GONNA LEAVE.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.353
YEAH, WELL,

19:13.386 --> 19:15.755
WE'LL HOPE FOR THE BEST.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.559
DAD, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT EVEN THOUGH

19:19.592 --> 19:21.961
I'M GONNA GET IN THAT CAR
AND DRIVE AWAY SOMEDAY,

19:21.994 --> 19:23.663
I'M ALSO GONNA
DRIVE BACK HOME.

19:23.696 --> 19:27.367
YEAH, PROBABLY WITH
A TRUNKFUL OF LAUNDRY.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.569
YEAH.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.480
AND NOW P.J. AND GABE

19:40.513 --> 19:42.382
HAVE A SPECIAL
BIRTHDAY SURPRISE FOR YOU.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.484

19:55.795 --> 19:58.498
( hip-hop beat playing )

20:00.567 --> 20:03.336

Can you say,
"Happy birthday, Teddy"?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.555
No? Okay.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.457
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

20:57.490 --> 21:01.294

Total freedom.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.644
Can you wish me
good luck, Charlie?

21:17.677 --> 21:19.746
It's the thought
that counts.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.591
ARE WE THERE YET?

21:31.624 --> 21:35.328
DID YOU SEE
A GRAND CANYON?

21:35.362 --> 21:37.330
I NEED TO GO

21:37.364 --> 21:40.467
