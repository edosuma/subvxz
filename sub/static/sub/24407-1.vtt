01:41.318 --> 01:43.927
- Wait what? What's this?
- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.148
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

01:55.332 --> 01:58.116
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know what the fuck this is.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.074
Hey asshole, P.D. Come on.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.165
Hello?

02:06.909 --> 02:08.691
What the fuck?!

02:08.693 --> 02:10.389
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Get the fuck out!

02:19.617 --> 02:21.051
- Let's go, bitch.
- Come on, let's go.

02:21.053 --> 02:23.141
Walk!

02:23.143 --> 02:26.146
Hey, bitch! Handcuff
your boy here.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.452
- Let's go!
- Move it, sunshine.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.324
Careful! Careful!

02:32.326 --> 02:34.154
Come on!

02:36.721 --> 02:38.852
Looks like we're
working overtime tonight, huh?

02:38.854 --> 02:40.549
You're not walking
from this, asshole!

02:40.551 --> 02:42.595
Wanna fuckin' bet?

02:42.597 --> 02:44.336
That's it! Move out!

02:44.338 --> 02:45.859
Hey! It's not worth it.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.776
Let's get the fuck outta here.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.224
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.324
That's when the bank
called to tell me

03:16.326 --> 03:19.109
I didn't write all those checks.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.286
I'm on Social Security.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.984
Yes, ma'am, there's a fraud
ring operating in this area.

03:23.986 --> 03:29.381
Well, they must've taken my
new checks outta my mailbox.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.296
Are you writing that down?

03:31.298 --> 03:33.950
Yes, ma'am.

03:33.952 --> 03:38.303
Out. Of. Your. Mailbox.

03:38.305 --> 03:41.001
You should get your checks
sent to a P.O. box

03:41.003 --> 03:42.698
or pick 'em up in person.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.919
It isn't easy for me
to get around, officer.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.312
I take the bus.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.965
- It's "Detective."
- Really?

03:48.967 --> 03:51.185
You seem too young.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.753
Well, I've aged some
since this conversation.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.798
Look,
we've got your information,

03:55.800 --> 03:58.410
here's my card,
don't hesitate to call

03:58.412 --> 04:00.414
if anything
else comes up.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.720
Scout,
where are you going?

04:13.122 --> 04:15.470
I'm not at liberty to say.

04:15.472 --> 04:18.125
Surely you people know
I can't make a comment

04:18.127 --> 04:21.259
on a goddamn investigation
that's ongoing!

04:21.261 --> 04:22.738
Oh, you want a sound bite?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.871
Sure.
How about "Go fuck yourself"?

04:24.873 --> 04:27.961
Thank you, Michael.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.919
Okay, next.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.748
- Drug holdup.
- Oh yeah.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.968
Fuckin' press is having
a field day with that one.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.622
These two stupid
fuckin' coconuts,

04:36.624 --> 04:38.276
they go get themselves
ripped off,

04:38.278 --> 04:39.799
upstairs is breathing down
my neck.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.017
I want on the case.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.324
It's handled, kid.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.108
Who?

04:45.110 --> 04:46.675
- Steve Kitchen.
- Kitchen?!

04:46.677 --> 04:49.330
Come on, Cap, that guy
couldn't find a clue

04:49.332 --> 04:50.984
if you FedEx'ed him one.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.507
He's got 15 years on you,
Michael.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.596
Plus he came up in the rotation,

04:54.598 --> 04:57.686
and, correct me if I'm
wrong, you're on a case?

04:57.688 --> 04:59.601
Paper pushing doesn't count.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.560
Lookit, that wasn't
some random score...

05:01.562 --> 05:03.170
someone knew to hit that van.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.259
That's what we call conjecture,
Michael.

05:05.261 --> 05:08.349
Yeah, well, let me on with
Kitchen, I'll find out.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.830
Michael, you haven't exactly
made what I would call

05:10.832 --> 05:13.398
a good case for team player
around here.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.489
I can work this one.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.492
I'm not my dad.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.058
Don't diss your old man, son.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.800
Try living in his shadow.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.804
Michael.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.242
Look, I know you can do the job.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.940
I'm the one that
put in for your promotion.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.377
But you are low man on
the totem pole here.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.990
You will get your shot.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.126
- No.
- No what?

05:46.128 --> 05:48.084
No, I do not want your
assistance on this case.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.260
Come on, Kitchen, I can
check some leads for you,

05:50.262 --> 05:51.958
- handle some legwork.
- I got this.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.090
I don't need a sous chef
just 'cause O'Brian

05:54.092 --> 05:58.094
handed you a toy detective
badge to play with.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.661
- What do you got there?
- We all done here?

05:59.663 --> 06:01.271
- What?
- I'm gonna go hit the head,

06:01.273 --> 06:02.403
wring it out.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.665
Let me know if you find it.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.016
Prick.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.764
You're late.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.725
I know, Carmen,
it won't happen again.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.728
You got something for me?

06:22.730 --> 06:26.601
I'm a little short this week,
Carmen.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.864
David, that is two strikes
in one day.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.910
Carmen, hear me out.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.434
Did you catch what
went down last night?

06:33.436 --> 06:35.436
Oh, don't make me guess.

06:35.438 --> 06:36.874
The police van holdup.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.485
What, you?

06:40.487 --> 06:43.531
Yeah. Well, I helped.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.361
I didn't know you had it
in ya, kid.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.625
Well, you know, first they
gotta transact the stuff,

06:50.627 --> 06:53.193
but then I could catch up
with you, plus interest.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.282
Yeah, what's the stuff?

06:55.284 --> 06:58.285
- Uh, Psidonader.
- Ha! What?

06:58.287 --> 06:59.939
I don't know,
that's what it said

06:59.941 --> 07:01.331
on the side of the barrels.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.463
Spell it.

07:02.465 --> 07:06.380
Uh, P-S-E-U...

07:06.382 --> 07:08.121
Pseudoephedrine?

07:08.123 --> 07:09.514
Yeah, yeah,
that's it, that's it.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.820
That's the shit
they make meth with.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.866
You could steal it,
you just can't pronounce it.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.128
Yeah, okay.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.304
So Ray's looking for a buyer.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.089
- Ray?
- Yeah, Blaine.

07:20.091 --> 07:23.399
Ray Blaine?
Works for Connolly?

07:25.532 --> 07:28.141
- What's it worth?
- Ray didn't say.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.708
I just know what it makes,

07:29.710 --> 07:31.361
so I figured
it's gotta be worth a lot.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.799
Blaine's too small-time
to move that much product

07:33.801 --> 07:35.714
on his own.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.020
It's Colton's show, he had
Ray put together the team

07:38.022 --> 07:39.848
and we just get a cut.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.198
- Did he?
- Mm-hmm.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.288
Tell ya what,
we'll buy it from you,

07:45.290 --> 07:48.770
deal us in, I'll get your debt
forgiven as a finder's fee.

07:48.772 --> 07:52.208
I don't know, Carmen.
It's not my call.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.864
Hmm. Well, I'll tell ya what.

07:55.866 --> 07:58.563
Here's your options.

07:58.565 --> 08:01.217
You and Blaine, you bring
me the goods,

08:01.219 --> 08:04.699
I up your cut 20 percent,

08:04.701 --> 08:05.744
you get your loan forgiven.
Win-win.

08:05.746 --> 08:08.268
If ya don't, well,

08:08.270 --> 08:11.576
what with
our insistence on protocol...

08:11.578 --> 08:14.842
it could prove injurious
to our friendship.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.106
My shop tonight.
10 o'clock.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.108
Oh, and David.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.329
Don't be fuckin' late.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.510
Get the fuck outta here.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.554
Brandt, DNA results

08:34.557 --> 08:36.121
back from the lab?

08:36.124 --> 08:37.558
The DNA on the vault
doesn't match

08:37.559 --> 08:39.168
that on the broken door glass.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.172
Get your fuckin' feet
off my desk.

08:42.390 --> 08:45.394
Shit! Asshole.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.222
You know, Connolly, you need

08:49.224 --> 08:52.138
to stick with that little
bad check case.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.357
Maybe when you're out
of diapers you can tag along.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.359
Kinda hypocritical when
you're wearing Depends.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.710
- Fuck you!
- Only if you're on the bottom, you fat fuck.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.276
You know,
losing that mouth may actually

09:00.278 --> 09:01.887
help you make some friends
around here.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.671
You know what?
I'm good flying solo.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.978
Yeah, how's that working out?

09:05.980 --> 09:09.070
Rotten tree, rotten apple.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.255
Fuckin' Connolly.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.392
Well?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.742
What you think, Kitchen?

09:30.744 --> 09:33.440
He bit.
His shop, ten tonight.

09:33.442 --> 09:36.486
Good.
Now get the fuck outta here.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.578
Go on, get the fuck outta here.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.842
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.383
Klaus, come.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.368
Alright, come on,
we're good.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.678
Come on, get in.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.651
You must be Ray.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.348
Paris here says you're buying.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.004
Follow me.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.704
It's alright man, come on.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.454
Hey, Ray, let me ask you
a question.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.151
Mind telling me
what you're doing

11:16.153 --> 11:18.023
stealing another man's property?

11:18.025 --> 11:20.025
We're not stealing it
from Cohen,

11:20.027 --> 11:21.417
we're selling it for him.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.768
Wasn't talking about Cohen.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.553
Took it from the cops, man,
what are you talking about?

11:26.555 --> 11:29.295
What's Cohen want for it?

11:29.297 --> 11:31.819
Half a mil a barrel.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.171
Two mil all in.

11:49.534 --> 11:53.538
- What's with the plastic?
- Paintin'.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.942
Oh, shit!

12:13.558 --> 12:15.863
Jesus Christ,
Schlychter,

12:15.865 --> 12:19.127
you didn't have to
kill the kid too.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.783
Clean up.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.480
Hurry.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.439
Klaus, come.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.460
This is Detective
Steven Kitchen, Cleveland P.D.

12:47.462 --> 12:48.548
Leave a message.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.942
Kitchen, Michael Connolly.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.076
Call me back, man.

13:16.143 --> 13:20.710
Carmen... those things
will kill ya.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.803
You gotta
die of something.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.588
Nice night.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.332
Yeah,
a lot of stars.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.161
You see up there?

13:36.163 --> 13:39.033
That's the Hunter. Orion.

13:39.035 --> 13:44.038
And those three bright
stars in perfect alignment,

13:44.040 --> 13:46.693
that's his belt.

13:46.695 --> 13:50.915
To the left you have
Canis Major and Canis Minor.

13:50.917 --> 13:55.093
So you see,
even up in the cosmos

13:55.095 --> 13:57.706
the Hunter has
his faithful dogs.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.101
So that's the Hunter,
and those are his dogs?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.493
Yeah.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.891
Klaus. Klaus, seek!

14:24.820 --> 14:26.602
No.

14:30.478 --> 14:33.176
Klaus! Klaus, come!

14:40.967 --> 14:46.971
You're way out of your jurisdiction
here, Detective Kitchen.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.538
Call off your fuckin' dog,
and I'll tell you why I'm here.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.453
I know why you're here.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.542
You pissed off the wrong guy.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.947
For crying out loud,
Schlychter, how many corpses

15:06.949 --> 15:08.383
are you gonna make tonight?

15:08.385 --> 15:11.647
Is it weighing
on your conscience?

15:11.649 --> 15:13.258
No.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.564
It's weighing on my back.

15:15.566 --> 15:19.438
I gotta haul this stiff
back to the lake.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.380
Conductor make you
stay late again?

15:48.382 --> 15:50.817
It was either this or write,
"I will not tap

15:50.819 --> 15:53.254
my foot to the music"
on the blackboard 100 times.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.213
Did you catch all the bad guys?

15:55.215 --> 15:57.650
Not all of them.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.219
Mmm, good.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.657
Then they need to keep you
on the payroll.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.442
Aren't the hall's new acoustics
amazing?

16:07.444 --> 16:09.270
Yeah tell me in the car.
I'm hungry.

16:09.272 --> 16:14.536
Alright, well...
how was it today?

16:14.538 --> 16:17.670
Oh, you know, same shit,
different day.

16:17.672 --> 16:21.326
Well, Connolly,
from where I stand,

16:21.328 --> 16:24.068
in your line of work,
boredom is a good thing.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.809
Well. it's the boredom
I can handle.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.814
What, are we not
playing well with others?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.860
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.341
Jesus, come on,
let's go feed you.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.822
Alright.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.000
Any idea where we
packed our wedding photos?

16:43.002 --> 16:47.308
Ah, I was on remote duty. So...

16:50.618 --> 16:53.401
- Hey, look.
- Hmm.

16:53.403 --> 16:56.972
- Where should we put it?
- I guess, ah, mothballs.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.458
Here.

17:06.286 --> 17:09.028
Make yourself useful.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.597
Closet shelf or storage.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.034
Come on.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.599
Come on, let's go.

17:18.602 --> 17:19.907
Aye, me.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.217
Okay.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.699
You should put that one out.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.943
You look like him there.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.076
Yeah, it's the pot
calling the kettle black.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.643
Don't say that.
You're not like him,

18:01.645 --> 18:03.515
and you need to find a way
to forgive him.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.517
Jia, can I just please
watch some TV?

18:05.519 --> 18:07.695
Can you stop trying to fix it?

18:12.395 --> 18:14.221
Fine.

18:14.223 --> 18:20.140
Yeah. Uh, just maybe one day
you could try to let it go.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.838
You know, for me?

18:22.840 --> 18:26.668
It'd be nice to live with
just one Connolly man.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.891
The dead one sucks up
a lot of oxygen around here.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.937
Yeah.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.636
The storage.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.598
Our patron donor

18:43.600 --> 18:46.862
behind this landmark
concert hall renovation

18:46.864 --> 18:49.213
is a third generation
Clevelander

18:49.215 --> 18:51.824
and a self-made shipping magnate

18:51.826 --> 18:53.391
who has made his family's name

18:53.393 --> 18:55.349
synonymous with
community service.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.960
His generous donations
over the years has enabled

18:57.962 --> 19:01.834
the Philharmonic not only
to survive but to flourish.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.966
On behalf of
the Philharmonic board,

19:03.968 --> 19:06.317
I ask you to join me
in welcoming

19:06.319 --> 19:08.014
three-time Cleveland
Chamber of Commerce

19:08.016 --> 19:10.712
Businessman of the Year
Angelo Leonetti.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.676
Thank you, Madam President.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.810
Well it seems that our
fair city has headed

19:21.812 --> 19:24.248
on an exciting road
to a bright future,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.902
and this magnificently
renovated concert hall

19:26.904 --> 19:28.861
is for all of us,
generations to come.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.819
Frankly, I can't wait to hear

19:30.821 --> 19:32.778
these talented musicians
perform in it.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.520
I am grateful to have
been able to contribute.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.610
Thank you very much.
Enjoy the festivities.

19:40.657 --> 19:43.051
Refreshments are
in the lounge.

20:14.517 --> 20:17.170
This is Detective
Steven Kitchen, Cleveland P.D.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.215
Leave a message.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.749
Oh, what the fuck?

20:30.054 --> 20:32.533
Cars come to us
with the plates pulled.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.319
We were about to mash it
when we saw it still had one.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.930
I contacted the DMV, they said
the plates were state-issued,

20:37.932 --> 20:39.323
so I called you guys.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.238
Did you check the trunk first?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.630
Yeah, empty.

20:42.632 --> 20:43.981
Forensics is on the way.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.157
What the fuck
are you doing here, Connolly?

20:48.159 --> 20:50.638
Relax, Brent, I called him.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.771
I brought some coffees.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.555
You hurt my feelings.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.340
Asshole can't even show up
on time.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.559
Would you two shut up?

20:58.561 --> 21:01.736
When was Kitchen last seen?

21:01.738 --> 21:03.303
Don't know.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.000
Day before yesterday.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.089
Yeah, he wouldn't
return my calls.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.570
So, it looks like you
got a missing drug case

21:09.572 --> 21:11.529
and no detective.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.835
Jesus, I can't believe
this guy.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.402
He's right, though.

21:15.404 --> 21:19.060
I'm swamped,
and nobody else is free.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.326
Come here, Michael.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.678
Look, until we know where
Kitchen is,

21:30.680 --> 21:32.811
I want you to loop me in.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.509
Do you understand me?

21:35.511 --> 21:38.425
I don't want you
disappearing like Kitchen.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.514
You got it, Cap.
I'm on it.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.605
Michael, Michael, Michael.

21:44.477 --> 21:48.392
Please don't make me
regret this decision.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.568
No, I got this, Cap.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.047
Oh, God.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.180
They questioned us
on the night,

21:54.182 --> 21:55.747
they questioned us the next day.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.792
Detective Kitchen
did a third pass.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.141
Why are we at this again?

21:59.143 --> 22:00.926
Because I need to hear it.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.884
So you cut down a back alley.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.277
It was a detour, roadwork.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.018
There was a guy
filling potholes.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.760
So one guy, a detour sign,

22:08.762 --> 22:11.110
late at night,
down a back alley.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.894
You didn't find this suspicious?

22:12.896 --> 22:15.027
Are you saying we didn't
do our job, Detective?

22:15.029 --> 22:18.247
I'm saying answer
the fuckin' question.

22:18.249 --> 22:21.816
Alright, after the fact,
yeah, maybe.

22:21.818 --> 22:24.428
In the moment, I saw a detour
and I detoured.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.646
You get a good look at him?

22:25.648 --> 22:27.561
He had a respirator
over his mouth.

22:27.563 --> 22:31.913
I did see the guy had
a tattoo on his neck.

22:31.915 --> 22:36.222
Black, jaggy, punk-ass
tribal-looking thing.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.920
So, why were they even moving
the pseudoephedrine anyway?

22:38.922 --> 22:41.140
To get it to a more
secure locker downtown.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.663
But the merch,
was from a bust two months ago.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.273
I mean, why move it now?

22:44.275 --> 22:45.362
Well don't ask us.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.015
We're just the messengers.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.453
Did you mention the transfer
to anyone beforehand?

22:49.455 --> 22:51.193
No... sir.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.892
Is there anything else... sir?

22:53.894 --> 22:55.025
That'll be all.

23:07.342 --> 23:10.909
So Miss Consolo, where
does your case stand now?

23:10.911 --> 23:12.563
Well, with my evidence
snatched,

23:12.565 --> 23:15.348
it gets buried in
the Indiana Jones warehouse.

23:15.350 --> 23:18.220
You know, every time
I think I've got a lead,

23:18.222 --> 23:23.617
it disappears... my witnesses,
my only evidence, poof, gone.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.880
All I'm left with are
hunches and theories.

23:25.882 --> 23:27.273
Like what?

23:27.275 --> 23:31.146
Okay, there's too many
disappearances

23:31.148 --> 23:34.411
and witnesses recanting
and suspects moving away

23:34.413 --> 23:35.934
through too many separate cases.

23:35.936 --> 23:38.676
I believe there is
an organized crime network

23:38.678 --> 23:40.329
behind this drug bust

23:40.331 --> 23:43.115
and half the unsolved crimes
in this town.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.899
I'll buy that.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.640
Who's behind it?

23:46.642 --> 23:49.164
Either off the grid...

23:49.166 --> 23:51.950
or high-profile
and hiding in plain sight.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.386
A name?

23:53.388 --> 23:56.913
Someone like Angelo Leonetti.

23:58.915 --> 24:02.134
Leonetti, shipping
Leonetti, who donates to every

24:02.136 --> 24:06.530
Cleveland civic anything,
including the police fund.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.357
Bingo. Hey,

24:08.359 --> 24:10.795
nobody goes after the goose
laying the golden eggs, right?

24:10.797 --> 24:13.406
Why doesn't that feel
as strange as it sounds?

24:13.408 --> 24:17.366
My wife would kill me going
after the guy that rebuilt

24:17.368 --> 24:21.198
the concert hall, she's a
cellist from the Philharmonic.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.896
Gimme a breadcrumb.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.028
Back your way
down the food chain.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.640
If he's got a business front,
so do his associates.

24:29.642 --> 24:33.472
- Such as?
- Check out Cohen Construction.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.736
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.484
Mr. Cohen,
can I get you anything?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.791
No.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.490
Oh, everybody's here.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.796
Mr. Leonetti,
how was the ceremony?

24:55.798 --> 24:57.145
Very nice, very nice.
They had cake.

24:57.147 --> 24:59.060
- Angelo.
- How ya doin', Kenny?

24:59.062 --> 25:01.541
Loretta, hold my calls,
would ya?

25:01.543 --> 25:03.108
- Yes sir.
- Yeah.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.458
Albert, give us a minute,
would ya? Thanks.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.416
Sit down.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.897
Ahh.

25:09.899 --> 25:13.379
- Thanks for coming, Kenny.
- Sure, sure.

25:13.381 --> 25:17.078
So what can I do for you,
Angelo?

25:17.080 --> 25:20.691
Well, look, I understand that
you're conducting business

25:20.693 --> 25:22.257
outside of channels,

25:22.259 --> 25:26.523
and I wanted to hear it
from the horse's mouth.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.046
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

25:28.048 --> 25:29.830
Yes, you are.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.180
You've overstepped your bounds.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.443
The pseudoephedrine.

25:34.445 --> 25:35.836
Look, I was gonna bring it
around to you.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.492
But you didn't.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.583
Have a fig, yeah?

25:43.585 --> 25:45.193
No.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.021
Come on, come on, come on.

25:47.023 --> 25:49.154
- Have a fig, Kenny, come on.
- I don't want a fig.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.375
Come on, I grow 'em myself.
They're good for ya.

25:57.947 --> 26:00.644
Look, we have this
gentleman's agreement.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.210
There's the hierarchy.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.561
You have not honored
that protocol.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.650
I apologize, Angelo.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.783
You know I would never do anything
to hurt our relationship.

26:09.785 --> 26:12.699
I'd appreciate the situation
not repeating itself.

26:12.701 --> 26:16.749
No, no, it won't,
I promise you, it won't.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.098
- Then we're good.
- We're good?

26:20.100 --> 26:21.316
- Yeah.
- We're good.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.146
That's it, we're good.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.512
No, I'm fine.

26:42.818 --> 26:46.211
You ever tried that?

26:46.213 --> 26:47.995
Nah.

26:47.997 --> 26:50.824
Looks like a geriatric
Bruce Lee movie

26:50.826 --> 26:53.348
in slow motion.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.437
You should try it.

26:55.439 --> 26:58.484
Why ruin this body
with muscles?

26:58.486 --> 27:03.881
It's like lethal force slowed
down into a meditative pace.

27:03.883 --> 27:07.277
Perfect control.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.279
We gotta clean things up

27:11.281 --> 27:13.455
before questions
start getting asked.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.066
So, when?

27:15.068 --> 27:16.458
The sooner the better.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.767
He works late most nights.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.075
Okay.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.441
Mr. Cohen?

27:42.443 --> 27:45.183
Michael Connolly,
Cleveland P.D.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.054
Just wonder if I could
have a moment of your time.

27:47.056 --> 27:50.884
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure,
come on, have a seat.

27:50.886 --> 27:54.585
Great. I'm looking into last
week's police van holdup.

27:56.762 --> 28:00.807
Oh yeah, yeah, I heard
about that on the news.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.940
What's that got to do with me?

28:02.942 --> 28:06.073
Well, we're checking out
businesses that employ ex-cons.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.858
You got a program, right?

28:07.860 --> 28:11.775
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
I give 'em a second chance,

28:11.777 --> 28:13.341
give something back.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.735
And the tax incentives
don't hurt.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.305
I'm a pragmatist, you know?
Two birds with one stone.

28:20.307 --> 28:24.093
Do you have any idea of anyone
that might have been involved?

28:26.661 --> 28:31.229
What can I say?
They're all ex-cons.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.753
I'm gonna have to ask to
look at your employee records.

28:33.755 --> 28:36.234
- Just see who's working for you.
- You are, huh?

28:36.236 --> 28:38.412
The department would
appreciate your cooperation.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.851
I'll bet it would.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.715
What the...

29:22.108 --> 29:23.936
Damn kids.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.863
Jesus Christ!

29:39.865 --> 29:42.737
Evening, Mr. Cohen.

29:45.261 --> 29:48.959
The man that came to see you
and just left.

29:48.961 --> 29:51.788
Was that a cop?

29:51.790 --> 29:55.704
Aren't you smart?

29:55.706 --> 29:57.924
What's his name?

29:57.926 --> 30:00.405
None of your business
what his name...

30:01.930 --> 30:04.759
Connolly. Michael Connolly.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.935
Thank you.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.242
He had a folder with him.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.158
What was in that folder?

30:14.160 --> 30:16.987
He asked me for
some employee records.

30:16.989 --> 30:20.338
It looks better
if I cooperate, okay?

30:20.340 --> 30:25.734
You know, I value integrity.

30:25.736 --> 30:29.869
Something you seem
to be lacking.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.002
Hey, you wanna tell
your poodle

30:32.004 --> 30:35.355
to stop scratching up my car,
you fuckin' Kraut?

30:38.271 --> 30:40.271
Do you know who I work with,
huh?

30:40.273 --> 30:42.403
If you touch me,
he'll have your head.

30:42.405 --> 30:46.059
Who do you think sent me?

31:14.176 --> 31:16.002
Oh, God.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.265
What time
did you leave him?

31:18.267 --> 31:20.180
About 7:30.
I must have been

31:20.182 --> 31:22.052
the last person
to see him alive.

31:22.054 --> 31:24.141
Well, next to last,
anyway.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.316
Yeah.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.492
Wasn't a robbery.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.798
Somebody didn't like me
talking to him.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.891
So far no prints, Captain,
but we're still checking.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.590
Wait, I got something.

31:38.592 --> 31:41.247
We got blood and broken glass.

31:43.031 --> 31:45.205
Type this against the victim,

31:45.207 --> 31:47.642
run it through the database
and make sure I see the report.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.862
Right away, sir.

31:49.864 --> 31:53.126
Well, Connolly,
you needed a lead,

31:53.128 --> 31:54.606
looks like you got you one.

31:54.608 --> 31:55.999
Yeah.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.566
Okay, so what
are we looking at?

31:58.568 --> 32:01.874
Cohen used Leonetti's
company here, here, and here.

32:01.876 --> 32:05.008
Yup... for shipping.

32:05.010 --> 32:08.794
It's all legit. Michael, we've
got nothing with any teeth here.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.101
Cohen's murders got enough
teeth to question him.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.667
Neutral stuff... did he have any
enemies?

32:12.669 --> 32:15.192
We need hard evidence.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.455
Look, you can't go in
at that level,

32:17.457 --> 32:20.545
- you'd just be poking the bear.
- Copy that, no bear fucking.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.503
I'm serious, Michael.

32:22.505 --> 32:27.247
Look, the bee stings the bear...
guess who wins?

32:27.249 --> 32:30.122
Back your way
down the food chain.

32:34.648 --> 32:36.300
No.

32:36.302 --> 32:37.910
Nope.

32:37.912 --> 32:38.998
No.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.088
None of 'em.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.829
Yeah, that's the little fucker.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.701
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

32:46.703 --> 32:47.966
Okay.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.455
That was fuckin' lit.

33:01.457 --> 33:02.717
Yeah.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.719
What are you doin' tonight?

33:04.721 --> 33:06.765
That's a good question.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.288
What are you doing tonight?

33:08.290 --> 33:11.335
- You.
- Oh-ho-ho!

33:11.337 --> 33:13.380
So I hear you're the guy
to know.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.165
Depends on what
you're looking for.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.862
A little something
to party on?

33:16.864 --> 33:18.472
What else
you got down there, huh?

33:18.474 --> 33:20.126
- There's enough.
- Oh, yeah?

33:20.128 --> 33:21.693
Yeah it's plenty, come on,

33:21.695 --> 33:23.260
we're gonna have a good time,
right?

33:23.262 --> 33:25.131
- Freeze, asshole!
- Hold still.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.872
You're under arrest,
anything you say

33:26.874 --> 33:29.179
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.703
But you already got
that memorized, don't ya?

33:31.705 --> 33:34.012
Fuck. Son of a bitch.

33:36.188 --> 33:39.189
Keller Abrams,

33:39.191 --> 33:42.540
let's skip right to the part
of who was on the holdup team.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.412
- What holdup?
- Points for trying.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.501
You were ID'ed at
the scene of the crime.

33:47.503 --> 33:50.243
In your line of work, you should
learn how to blend in more.

33:50.245 --> 33:52.941
Look, it's late, I want
to get home for dinner.

33:52.943 --> 33:56.206
So, as an unarmed accessory,
I can reduce your sentence

33:56.208 --> 33:58.208
by you cooperating with me.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.905
And if I don't?

33:59.907 --> 34:01.776
Then I've got you
selling illegal narcotics

34:01.778 --> 34:04.390
to my undercover cop...
it's win-win for me.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.261
So what's in it for me?

34:08.263 --> 34:12.135
Well, that says you've got
two priors,

34:12.137 --> 34:15.138
so sentencing-wise this wouldn't
work out too well for you.

34:15.139 --> 34:18.143
Let's just say I'll keep you
out of three-strike city.

34:19.969 --> 34:22.406
Guy I work with
brought me in.

34:22.408 --> 34:23.929
Ray Blaine.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.409
Does he work for Cohen
Construction too?

34:26.411 --> 34:29.282
Yeah, he's not shown up
all week.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.849
Tell me about him.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.938
What do you want to know?

34:32.940 --> 34:36.072
Is he Pisces?
Does he have brown hair?

34:36.074 --> 34:38.119
Take a fuckin' guess.

34:40.339 --> 34:43.079
Okay, Ray, and me met up
before with one of the gunmen.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.475
Guy bragged about having
a line in with a bigwig.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.132
Can you put me
in touch with him?

35:03.971 --> 35:06.580
Uhh! Ohh!

35:06.582 --> 35:09.150
Fuck, yeah. Ahh!

35:10.543 --> 35:13.370
Damn.

35:13.372 --> 35:17.069
- You are good at that.
- My turn.

35:17.071 --> 35:19.941
Let me catch my breath first,
hmm?

35:19.943 --> 35:21.031
Ohh.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.386
Yeah.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.832
Did you paint in here?

35:42.270 --> 35:43.704
Right.

35:43.706 --> 35:46.925
Like I'd bother with this dump.

35:46.927 --> 35:50.189
We're gonna get a place
of our own, aren't we?

35:50.191 --> 35:53.061
Yeah, baby. Yeah,
once this money comes in,

35:53.063 --> 35:55.020
we'll get a great place.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.588
Maybe a new town?

35:57.590 --> 36:00.984
Ray's gotta find the buyer
for the 'phedrine first.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.248
Did that last bit of info
help?

36:05.250 --> 36:06.249
- Yup.
- Yeah?

36:06.251 --> 36:07.902
Yeah.

36:07.904 --> 36:11.341
Yeah, it earned me a leg up
with the big man.

36:11.343 --> 36:14.213
- It's gonna pay off big-time.
- Good.

36:14.215 --> 36:15.564
Yeah.

36:17.044 --> 36:21.004
Speaking of, have you heard
anything else?

36:27.968 --> 36:30.664
- First things first.
- What?

36:30.666 --> 36:33.537
Catch your breath yet?

36:33.539 --> 36:35.278
- Oh.
- My turn.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.977
Okay.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.242
Keller's gotta get
Jimmy Marco to say

36:43.244 --> 36:46.463
he was there,
and who else was a part of it.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.116
And that Cohen hired them.

36:48.118 --> 36:51.078
Laura, breathe.
I got it.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.602
- When's he meeting him?
- Ten o'clock.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.604
Okay. Well, let me know
what Marco says.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.519
- Yeah.
- Okay?

36:59.521 --> 37:01.347
Sarah, I told you
you didn't have to stay,

37:01.349 --> 37:02.609
go get some lunch, honey.

37:02.611 --> 37:04.483
I will, thanks.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.537
Hey, Jimmy.

37:24.590 --> 37:28.113
So what's so important
that we gotta meet?

37:28.115 --> 37:30.768
Wondering what we're doing.

37:30.770 --> 37:33.292
I haven't heard from Ray,
have you?

37:33.294 --> 37:35.425
No.

37:35.427 --> 37:38.604
Who do you sell the stuff to?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.303
I don't know.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.177
Are you okay?

37:49.179 --> 37:52.572
You seem a little off.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.184
I'm fine.

37:55.925 --> 37:59.536
What about that bigwig
you had a line in with?

37:59.538 --> 38:01.148
What'd you say his name was?

38:03.846 --> 38:06.371
Why are you asking
so many questions?

38:07.676 --> 38:09.546
I need to get paid.
I did a job,

38:09.548 --> 38:11.506
I want to get paid.
I've got bills.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.727
I didn't say his name.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.731
Do me a favor, why don't
you lift your shirt?

38:20.733 --> 38:22.559
What the fuck?

38:22.561 --> 38:24.780
I fuckin' knew it,
motherfucker!

38:25.781 --> 38:27.390
- Freeze!
- Jimmy, police!

38:27.392 --> 38:29.217
- Shit!
- Jimmy, everybody relax.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.394
- Hold it, Jimmy.
- Hey! Hey hey hey hey!

38:31.396 --> 38:33.787
Relax, relax...
Gun! He's got a gun!

38:33.789 --> 38:35.833
Gun!

38:35.835 --> 38:38.838
Jimmy! Drop...
Drop the gun!

38:44.104 --> 38:46.365
Freeze, motherfucker!

38:46.367 --> 38:48.367
Cuffs, give me the cuffs.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.803
Shots fired,
one subject down...

38:49.805 --> 38:51.588
Don't you fuckin' move.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.677
Requesting an ambulance
onsite.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.158
What do we got?

39:00.294 --> 39:01.600
Fuck.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.390
You're quiet tonight.

39:11.436 --> 39:14.395
Yeah, I just got a lot
on my mind.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.876
What, work?

39:18.878 --> 39:21.010
Oh, I got that big
holdup case.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.622
Michael,
why didn't you say so?

39:25.624 --> 39:28.670
I mean, I thought they
gave it to somebody else.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.370
What happened?

39:34.502 --> 39:38.027
Cap asked if I wanted
the case. I said yeah.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.290
Well, aren't you excited?

39:42.292 --> 39:45.206
No, it's just a lot of work.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.252
Ah.

39:47.254 --> 39:50.170
He teamed you up
with the other guy?

39:51.476 --> 39:53.216
Kitchen?

39:55.088 --> 39:57.610
Yeah, I'm on the same case.

39:57.612 --> 40:00.265
What time are
you going in tomorrow?

40:00.267 --> 40:02.746
Eight o'clock,
organizing task force.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.748
Hey, your phones in here,

40:04.750 --> 40:06.227
you just got a text.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.490
What does it say?

40:07.492 --> 40:09.100
"Internal Affairs meeting
in a.m.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.797
about involvement
in tonight's shooting."

40:10.799 --> 40:13.583
- I...
- You were in a shooting?

40:13.585 --> 40:16.368
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want you to worry.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.631
No.

40:18.633 --> 40:21.244
You didn't want me to know.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.160
I'm your partner, Michael...

40:26.162 --> 40:29.512
not your backdrop.
There are two of us here.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.604
You married a cop.

40:35.389 --> 40:38.695
Right, I knew what I was
signing up for,

40:38.697 --> 40:41.088
I knew the dangers.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.395
I just thought that we
were a team, you know,

40:43.397 --> 40:46.050
that you wouldn't hide things
from me.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.008
It's my job.

40:48.010 --> 40:51.185
This is our life.

40:51.187 --> 40:53.712
It affects me too.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.632
Here.

41:16.822 --> 41:19.257
So the perp pulls a piece
just like this

41:19.259 --> 41:22.086
on your dad, point blank,
twitchy as shit.

41:22.088 --> 41:25.655
You're dad was as cool
as a Buddha.

41:25.657 --> 41:27.483
- Do you know what he did?
- Hmm.

41:27.485 --> 41:31.138
He asks the perp had he ever
killed a guy.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.184
The perp says no,

41:33.186 --> 41:37.318
and your dad said,
"It changes you, man.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.018
Like, I take a bullet,
I'm done in a second.

41:41.020 --> 41:46.458
My face will haunt you
in your nightmares.

41:46.460 --> 41:49.766
Trust me. You don't want it."

41:49.768 --> 41:51.594
Do you know what happened?

41:51.596 --> 41:52.856
The perp freezes,

41:52.858 --> 41:55.075
your dad whip-grabs the pistol,

41:55.077 --> 41:56.555
kung-fu's him
to the ground,

41:56.557 --> 41:59.776
cuffs him
while I'm pissing my pants.

42:02.476 --> 42:05.303
Your dad was one
stone-cold cop.

42:05.305 --> 42:07.871
Yeah, he was one
stone-cold father, too.

42:07.873 --> 42:09.829
Oh, Mikey.

42:09.831 --> 42:12.007
He did the best he could.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.969
Whatever happened
that night he...

42:18.971 --> 42:20.755
You read the report.

42:23.366 --> 42:25.412
That was paper.

42:26.718 --> 42:29.545
I wanna hear you tell it.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.331
You were there.

42:33.246 --> 42:36.247
Drugs went missing
from evidence.

42:36.249 --> 42:39.424
I got word that
Stevie was setting up a deal

42:39.426 --> 42:41.905
with the Italians.

42:41.907 --> 42:48.302
So I go down there, maybe talk
some sense into your dad,

42:48.304 --> 42:50.914
the Wop pulls a piece.

42:50.916 --> 42:53.743
Everything went to shit.

42:53.745 --> 42:57.050
He shot him before I
could take him out.

42:57.052 --> 42:59.836
It was over in a second.

42:59.838 --> 43:04.449
I'd like to feel that maybe your
dad was setting him up somehow.

43:04.451 --> 43:07.800
Yeah, well, that's not how
Internal Affairs saw it.

43:07.802 --> 43:12.065
I fought them to pay
out his benefits, but...

43:12.067 --> 43:14.940
Your mom didn't deserve
to lose 'em.

43:17.116 --> 43:21.553
I have always felt responsible.

43:21.555 --> 43:24.295
No, don't,
he did it to himself.

43:24.297 --> 43:28.954
Mikey, you dad was a good man,
not a perfect one.

43:30.695 --> 43:34.522
Anybody could have been tempted.
Anybody.

43:34.524 --> 43:37.177
I mean, he had a wife and a kid
to take care of

43:37.179 --> 43:39.005
on a cop's salary.

43:39.007 --> 43:43.444
He always had
this wall of approval

43:43.446 --> 43:46.970
that I can never quite
climb my ass over.

43:46.972 --> 43:51.104
You know, I used to hate dinner

43:51.106 --> 43:54.194
cause he'd grill me...

43:54.196 --> 43:57.241
"Was that up to code, Mikey?"

43:57.243 --> 44:02.507
And I spent my entire childhood
trying to get my ass up to code.

44:02.509 --> 44:05.510
It was like running
through the desert,

44:05.512 --> 44:09.949
chasing a...

44:09.951 --> 44:12.386
- What are those things called?
- Mirage.

44:12.388 --> 44:14.954
Mirage, yeah.

44:14.956 --> 44:18.046
Turns out it was all
a bunch of bullshit.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.095
Mikey...

44:25.097 --> 44:28.794
I can say this
because I knew your dad.

44:28.796 --> 44:31.928
Your father had a vision...

44:31.930 --> 44:35.192
the man that
he wanted you to be,

44:35.194 --> 44:37.370
and that wasn't a lie.

44:44.333 --> 44:46.116
Jimmy.

44:46.118 --> 44:49.554
- Have a seat. How'd you sleep?
- Fuck you.

44:49.556 --> 44:51.643
Well, let's see how
our date goes first.

44:51.645 --> 44:54.124
How'd you get involved
in a police holdup?

44:54.126 --> 44:55.516
Yeah, I wasn't.

44:55.518 --> 44:57.823
Well, Keller Abram
said otherwise.

44:57.825 --> 44:59.390
Keller Abram is dead.

44:59.392 --> 45:01.174
Well, you say that like
that's all I got on you,

45:01.176 --> 45:03.002
but your parking lot adventure

45:03.004 --> 45:05.004
the other night is enough
to cost ya ten years.

45:05.006 --> 45:07.006
Listen, your only
bargaining chip

45:07.008 --> 45:08.706
is to tell me about the holdup.

45:11.056 --> 45:13.099
This guy that brought you in,
Ray Blaine...

45:13.101 --> 45:15.623
Yeah?

45:15.625 --> 45:18.322
What's his plan?
Where is he now?

45:18.324 --> 45:20.585
Haven't seen him
in a few days.

45:20.587 --> 45:23.327
So either he took off
with your cut

45:23.329 --> 45:25.853
or something happened to him.
I mean, either way...

45:28.073 --> 45:30.421
He said he got a better offer
on the stuff,

45:30.423 --> 45:31.988
- Paris had hooked him up.
- Paris?

45:31.990 --> 45:33.774
David Paris.

45:35.210 --> 45:38.168
- Who's your buyer?
- He didn't say,

45:38.170 --> 45:40.083
he just said he was going
downtown to a fish store.

45:40.085 --> 45:41.475
Dinner fish or hobby fish?

45:41.477 --> 45:43.828
Ya got me,
all I heard was fish.

45:45.873 --> 45:49.266
Hmm. Well, I mean,
it sounds like

45:49.268 --> 45:52.269
an awfully big score
for little Ray to mastermind.

45:52.271 --> 45:53.879
Well, he didn't.

45:53.881 --> 45:56.621
He put together the crew,
his boss is behind it.

45:56.623 --> 45:58.362
Kenny Cohen,
how'd you know him?

45:58.364 --> 46:00.668
I don't really know him.

46:00.670 --> 46:03.671
Keller said you were bragging about
having some in with some bigwig.

46:03.673 --> 46:06.196
Now listen, Jimmy, I can make
this whole thing dependent

46:06.198 --> 46:08.285
on you telling me what
you're not telling me.

46:08.287 --> 46:10.591
- Bullshit.
- If you're withholding information

46:10.593 --> 46:13.943
that can tie together my case,
you bet your ass I can.

46:13.945 --> 46:15.596
Sometimes I pass info on
to this guy,

46:15.598 --> 46:17.033
he pays me,
what he does with it

46:17.035 --> 46:19.383
is none of my business,
but sometimes...

46:19.385 --> 46:24.692
sometimes after, the somebody
that's tied to it...

46:24.694 --> 46:27.347
Look, any blowback lands
on me, it's over, you know?

46:27.349 --> 46:29.612
No, I don't.

46:31.789 --> 46:35.007
It's like a rumor around town,
you mess up, you disappear.

46:35.009 --> 46:37.793
Jimmy, you're in police
custody, we can protect you.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.753
No, you can't.

46:41.668 --> 46:45.235
Alright, you know what,
the only other option

46:45.237 --> 46:47.759
is to put out the word
you spilled the beans

46:47.761 --> 46:50.327
and we release ya
onto the street

46:50.329 --> 46:52.285
and then we see if your bigwig

46:52.287 --> 46:55.029
and his bogeymen
decide that you messed up.

46:58.337 --> 47:00.554
- I got him.
- Him who?

47:00.556 --> 47:02.774
Leonetti.

47:02.776 --> 47:05.168
- Angelo Leonetti?
- That's the one.

47:05.170 --> 47:07.607
Wait, is this based on
the testimony of that kid?

47:09.261 --> 47:12.740
Leonetti pays him for
information, people go missing.

47:12.742 --> 47:14.264
How do we play this?

47:14.266 --> 47:18.964
Wait, Michael,
there's no "play this.

47:18.966 --> 47:21.575
You're talking about one
of our city's patrons.

47:21.577 --> 47:23.664
Marco's testimony is enough
to launch an investigation.

47:23.666 --> 47:25.449
You're aware that
you're talking about

47:25.451 --> 47:28.278
the guy who bankrolls
the police fund every year,

47:28.280 --> 47:30.715
he plays poker with the mayor,
Michael.

47:30.717 --> 47:33.109
So I can't request
a warrant...

47:33.111 --> 47:35.241
There are people
that you go after

47:35.243 --> 47:37.591
on the word of some scumbag
punk, and there's...

47:37.593 --> 47:39.942
Michael, listen to me...
there's ones that you don't.

47:39.944 --> 47:42.509
Cap, we can't let this guy
walk if he's responsible

47:42.511 --> 47:43.946
for half the crimes
in the city

47:43.948 --> 47:45.948
just because of all the commas
and zeroes

47:45.950 --> 47:47.514
he has in his tax return.

47:47.516 --> 47:49.777
Michael, you need to find
something

47:49.779 --> 47:52.780
to back up the kid's testimony.

47:52.782 --> 47:55.307
Otherwise, it's mitts off.

48:08.276 --> 48:10.059
Here ya go, missy.

48:10.061 --> 48:12.148
Don't forget to water him.

48:12.150 --> 48:14.239
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

48:38.393 --> 48:41.438
Everybody goes for
the lionfish.

48:41.440 --> 48:44.269
You gotta watch those fin rays,
though, they're poisonous.

48:45.879 --> 48:48.575
Personally, I like this
little guy over here,

48:48.577 --> 48:50.101
come check this out.

49:05.333 --> 49:07.464
- Ohh... Wow.
- Stonefish.

49:07.466 --> 49:09.511
Nobody ever sees
them coming.

49:10.991 --> 49:13.339
You looking for anything
in particular today?

49:13.341 --> 49:16.516
Ah, wife wanted a baby,
I said let's start with a fish.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.650
Well, if you have any questions,
let me know.

49:19.652 --> 49:21.088
Alright.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.835
I just love these little shops.

49:30.837 --> 49:33.359
Little ma-and-pa's.
Been here long?

49:33.361 --> 49:35.102
25 years.

49:36.886 --> 49:39.713
You haven't been bought out
by the box stores,

49:39.715 --> 49:41.454
Fishes R Us?

49:41.456 --> 49:45.110
Not yet. It's tough
to stay afloat, though.

49:45.112 --> 49:48.333
Take a whole lotta guppies.
Mind if I grab one of these?

49:50.770 --> 49:52.119
Puccinaldi. Is that Italian?

49:54.426 --> 49:56.339
Born and raised
in Little Italy.

49:56.341 --> 49:58.167
Oh, old-school.
Yeah, my dad, too.

49:58.169 --> 50:01.605
Oh yeah?
What'd he do?

50:01.607 --> 50:03.652
A fisherman, actually.

50:06.046 --> 50:10.007
You know, I think we need to
set you up with a starter fish.

50:42.300 --> 50:45.129
We had an arrangement, Angelo.

50:46.826 --> 50:49.696
I pocket the 'phedrine,
your case gets buried.

50:49.698 --> 50:53.352
But then you got greedy.

50:53.354 --> 50:55.659
You took it back.

50:55.661 --> 50:57.965
And that upset the balance.

50:57.967 --> 51:00.751
This wasn't my hand, Jack.

51:00.753 --> 51:03.536
You stole what was mine.

51:03.538 --> 51:05.582
I don't give a fuck
which minion did it.

51:05.584 --> 51:08.280
That problem has been
eliminated.

51:08.282 --> 51:10.413
And it's your fuckin' job
to cold-case it.

51:10.415 --> 51:13.764
Your sloppy elimination job
is the problem, Angelo,

51:13.766 --> 51:16.941
you left a fuckin' body
in a parking lot.

51:16.943 --> 51:20.162
Tell me, how do I sweep
that under the rug?

51:20.164 --> 51:22.425
There's just so many holes
in the boat I can plug up.

51:22.427 --> 51:25.471
Why don't you just pull off
your bloodhound puppy, huh?

51:25.473 --> 51:27.343
Cause he's nipping at heels.

51:27.345 --> 51:29.345
It's a little late for that,
Angelo.

51:29.347 --> 51:33.175
Your jailbird?
He's flapping his jaw.

51:33.177 --> 51:35.568
Give me a fuckin' break.

51:35.570 --> 51:37.309
That's hearsay from
a goddamn lowlife.

51:37.311 --> 51:40.051
It's enough to kick-start
the kid's case,

51:40.053 --> 51:42.967
and I've tugged his collar all
I can without raising eyebrows.

51:42.969 --> 51:45.187
Take him off the case, Jack.

51:45.189 --> 51:47.452
It's in your best interest.

51:49.889 --> 51:52.237
That sounds a lot
like a threat to me.

51:52.239 --> 51:55.371
Nah, that's just a little
friendly advice.

51:55.373 --> 51:58.504
A threat would be more like
making

51:58.506 --> 52:01.028
your extracurricular
entrepreneurships public.

52:01.030 --> 52:03.988
That goes both ways,
old friend.

52:03.990 --> 52:06.427
No honor among thieves huh?

52:09.604 --> 52:13.040
Killing you, it just
might be worth it.

52:13.042 --> 52:15.434
You know what
we got in common?

52:15.436 --> 52:17.088
We got enough common sense
to curb

52:17.090 --> 52:19.960
our baser instincts for
the benefit of mutual gain.

52:19.962 --> 52:22.702
And we can hate each other
as much as we want,

52:22.704 --> 52:24.576
but we need each other.

52:26.273 --> 52:28.580
Right the ship, Jack.

53:00.742 --> 53:01.917
Yeah?

53:03.919 --> 53:06.224
Confirmed?

53:06.226 --> 53:08.359
Marco's dead?

53:10.709 --> 53:12.189
Yeah.

53:13.451 --> 53:15.496
Yeah, no, thanks.

53:18.804 --> 53:20.806
Fuck!

54:17.515 --> 54:20.213
Born and raised in Little Italy.

54:21.736 --> 54:22.998
Shit.

54:40.015 --> 54:43.147
Larceny, B and E, petty theft,
truancy...

54:43.149 --> 54:45.018
I mean, he was a real
little Al Capone.

54:45.020 --> 54:47.978
From the last one, May '77,
he did a year in Juvie.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.763
So what, after
that he just went straight?

54:50.765 --> 54:53.331
Or he got smart.
Check out the police report.

54:53.333 --> 54:57.640
Look who is listed at the last
B and E, and walked away,

54:57.642 --> 55:00.253
while Carmen did a year
in Juvie.

55:01.428 --> 55:03.082
Oh, my God.

55:09.349 --> 55:12.872
That was us once.

55:12.874 --> 55:15.484
The hood didn't have
nice parks.

55:15.486 --> 55:18.356
We were knocking over
liquor stores.

55:18.358 --> 55:22.404
- Could have been different.
- Nah, it's in the blood.

55:22.406 --> 55:23.711
Yeah.

55:26.888 --> 55:29.715
I gotta tell you something,
Carmen.

55:29.717 --> 55:32.283
I'm sick of all this drug shit.

55:32.285 --> 55:34.067
I wanna be done with it.

55:34.069 --> 55:36.113
This is not how
I wanna be remembered.

55:36.115 --> 55:39.290
Kidding me? You're gonna be
remembered as a patron saint.

55:39.292 --> 55:43.207
Ah, bullshit. It's all
built on a house of cards.

55:43.209 --> 55:44.687
I guess I opened up
a can of worms

55:44.689 --> 55:47.124
bringing the ephedrine back
from Cohen.

55:47.126 --> 55:49.518
I should have asked you first.
I'm sorry, Ange.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.130
You didn't know.

55:54.133 --> 55:56.481
- Carmen.
- Yeah?

55:56.483 --> 55:59.441
About the pseudoephedrine...
you should handle it.

55:59.443 --> 56:01.399
- Yeah, right.
- No, right.

56:01.401 --> 56:04.141
Take it.
Just move the stuff.

56:04.143 --> 56:05.664
- You're serious?
- Yeah, yeah.

56:05.666 --> 56:08.754
You know my contacts.
Just move the stuff.

56:08.756 --> 56:11.627
You can have my cut.

56:11.629 --> 56:13.542
- Huh?
- Hey, Ange,

56:13.544 --> 56:16.109
you got a brain tumor
or something?

56:16.111 --> 56:18.462
I don't have
a fuckin' brain tumor.

56:20.899 --> 56:23.290
I don't trust anybody but you.

56:23.292 --> 56:24.729
Capisce?

56:26.295 --> 56:27.862
Thank you.

56:37.132 --> 56:39.959
Detective Connolly,
I have the DNA results

56:39.961 --> 56:42.701
from the blood on that
glass shard at Cohen's car.

56:42.703 --> 56:45.617
- Canis lupus familiaris.
- What is that?

56:45.619 --> 56:47.097
Doggy.

56:47.099 --> 56:49.101
Doberman.

56:50.711 --> 56:52.321
Thank you.

57:57.648 --> 58:00.257
Shit!

58:22.499 --> 58:24.586
Hey, I was just about
to call you.

58:24.588 --> 58:26.979
A dog
just attacked me.

58:26.981 --> 58:28.851
A dog just attacked you.
Where?

58:28.853 --> 58:31.288
- In my office.
- In your office?

58:31.290 --> 58:34.206
- In my fucking office.
- Jesus, you okay?

58:35.294 --> 58:36.728
Wait, what kinda dog?

58:36.730 --> 58:39.862
A big scary-as-shit kind,
with teeth.

58:39.864 --> 58:41.211
Where is it now?

58:41.213 --> 58:43.343
I don't know.

58:43.345 --> 58:45.824
Okay listen, the blood match
on Cohen's car was a Doberman.

58:45.826 --> 58:47.304
Yeah, yeah,
that was it, a Doberman.

58:47.306 --> 58:48.827
I mean, we gotta be
getting close

58:48.829 --> 58:50.220
if they're trying to scare you.

58:50.222 --> 58:52.920
Wait. Who else knows
about this case?

59:05.977 --> 59:08.630
You have one new message.

59:08.632 --> 59:11.415
First new message sent today.

59:11.417 --> 59:15.288
Evening, Sarah.

59:15.290 --> 59:17.116
Who are you?

59:17.118 --> 59:21.077
I'm a friend of Jimmy's.

59:21.079 --> 59:23.645
You knew Jimmy?

59:23.647 --> 59:25.951
Yeah.

59:25.953 --> 59:28.519
I'm really sorry
what happened to him.

59:28.521 --> 59:32.567
You know, Jimmy used to
provide us with information

59:32.569 --> 59:36.832
that you got from that female
attorney you're working with.

59:36.834 --> 59:41.880
What did she and this young
detective talk about this morning?

59:41.882 --> 59:43.795
They talked about getting

59:43.797 --> 59:46.755
a search warrant
for Carmen Puccinaldi.

59:46.757 --> 59:49.671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:52.763 --> 59:55.807
You know, I can get a lot
of information for you.

59:55.809 --> 59:58.418
I can do whatever you want.
I have connections in

59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.856
the District Attorneys office,
I'm really good at this,

01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:02.945
- I've been doing for a while.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:05.469
That's very good.

01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:07.778
I like that idea.

01:00:13.087 --> 01:00:15.786
May I have a glass of water?

01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:19.614
Okay.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.921
Yeah, sure.

01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:33.149
Carmen,
want another one?

01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:35.806
- Yeah babe, hit me again.
- You got it.

01:00:37.024 --> 01:00:38.633
- Carmen.
- Hey, man.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.286
Can I get you something?

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:42.769
No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:50.166
Hey, listen.

01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:55.650
The cops are obtaining
a search warrant on you.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.826
It's no problem.
Angelo will get me outta that.

01:00:57.828 --> 01:00:59.741
One phone call to the mayor.

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:02.744
No, it's past that point.

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:04.791
Says who?

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:12.579
He wants me to
take the fall again.

01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:14.409
Fuckin' Angelo.

01:01:21.242 --> 01:01:24.463
He's not untouchable, you know.

01:01:30.382 --> 01:01:32.776
So what's this, a warning?

01:01:34.865 --> 01:01:38.607
No, my friend,
it's a head start.

01:01:40.305 --> 01:01:42.609
Okay?

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:44.613
Take it easy.

01:02:15.906 --> 01:02:18.123
Goddamn it, I knew it.
Fuckin' cop.

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.300
Hey, what's up?

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.912
Open the door,
you little ravioli.

01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:26.566
We open in 20.

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.394
Open the door.

01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:32.094
What happened,
your goldfish die?

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:34.357
Yeah. I got the key in the back.
I just gotta...

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:37.275
Alright boys. Now, back alley.
Door. Right now. Get him.

01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:40.887
Let's go. Move, move, move.

01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:46.240
Fuck! Where are the keys?!

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:50.767
Fuck me.

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:53.811
- Hi.
- Fuck you!

01:02:53.813 --> 01:02:57.597
Carmen, drop the gun.

01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.643
You drop it.

01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:01.516
Dude, seriously?

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:06.783
Four against one, you think
you're gonna get very far?

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:12.003
Awright, fuck it,
I'll tell ya everything

01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.831
you wanna know about
Angelo Leonetti.

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.833
- Okay.
- I'm not letting

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:18.053
that motherfucker
throw me under the bus again.

01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:20.272
You cut me a deal, I'll tell
you who the real Angelo...

01:03:20.274 --> 01:03:22.100
Who shot?

01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:24.363
Down, down, down, down,
down, get down!

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:25.887
Guys, check the roofs!

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:26.975
Check the roofs!

01:03:26.977 --> 01:03:28.585
Check the roofs!

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:30.630
Man down, we got a man down!

01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:31.631
Someone check the roof.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:54.091
You are low
man on the totem pole here.

01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:58.180
I believe there is

01:03:58.182 --> 01:04:00.184
an organized crime network.

01:04:02.055 --> 01:04:03.968
You need to find something

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:07.365
to back up the kid's testimony,
otherwise it's mitts off.

01:04:10.759 --> 01:04:12.759
Who's behind it?

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:15.112
Someone like Angelo Leonetti.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.976
I didn't realize
anyone was there. Sorry.

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:58.022
Well, I didn't mean
to startle you. Sorry.

01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:01.156
No, it's okay.

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:03.462
Embarrassed is more like it.

01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:06.378
No, on the contrary.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.513
Johann Sebastian Bach's Courante

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:12.732
requires great discipline,

01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:14.386
tempo giusto.

01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:17.520
Bravo. Impressive.

01:05:17.522 --> 01:05:20.740
Your "name that tune"
is impressive.

01:05:20.742 --> 01:05:23.134
Are you a musician?

01:05:23.136 --> 01:05:26.007
Me, musician? No, no.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:28.574
But my grandfather was.

01:05:28.576 --> 01:05:33.320
Unfortunately, it didn't
trickle down to me.

01:05:34.974 --> 01:05:37.235
May I?

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:39.020
Sure, please.

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:40.501
Thank you.

01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:45.550
Wow.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:51.467
What did your grandfather
play?

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:54.428
My grand...
Oh! Violin.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.779
With the Berlin Philharmonics.

01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:02.826
But unfortunately,

01:06:02.828 --> 01:06:07.396
the Nazis came to power.

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:09.748
He was drafted.

01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:19.930
You know, my grandfather,
he used to tell me stories

01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:22.628
from the war...

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:25.370
horrific things, really.

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:27.503
But he always told me.

01:06:27.505 --> 01:06:32.899
I'm telling you this so that you
can one day tell your children

01:06:32.901 --> 01:06:37.078
and they in their turn
can tell theirs

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.298
and hopefully
this horrible thing

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.521
will never happen again.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:01.493
My grandfather said,

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:05.021
"I wish they have sent me
to the front to die."

01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:12.722
No, instead, he was sent
to a concentration camp

01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:16.552
and he served in a unit
where they separated children

01:07:16.554 --> 01:07:18.641
from their parents...

01:07:18.643 --> 01:07:21.948
healthy children
to the work stations,

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:24.779
and... the other children...

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:32.611
One day the officers found
out that my grandfather

01:07:32.613 --> 01:07:34.657
was a great violinist,

01:07:34.659 --> 01:07:37.573
and they ordered him
to put together

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:42.099
some entertainment for the
officers when they had a party,

01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:45.322
entertainment performed
by the Jewish prisoners.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:52.718
Then there was this
Christmas celebration...

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.984
and there was a young girl,
12, 13 years old,

01:07:57.986 --> 01:08:01.945
with the voice of an angel,
according to my grandfather,

01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:05.429
and she sang for the officers.

01:08:07.344 --> 01:08:09.779
Then one officer stood up
and said,

01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:12.912
"No more of this Jewish shit!

01:08:12.914 --> 01:08:16.350
I wanna hear
a German Christmas song,

01:08:16.353 --> 01:08:18.569
I wanna hear Silent Night."

01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:23.270
She didn't know Silent Night,
the Jewish girl.

01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:26.143
The officer went up to her
and slapped her

01:08:26.145 --> 01:08:29.714
and said, "You better sing
Silent Night."

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:34.456
Officer went up
to my grandfather and said,

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:38.636
"You take this piece of shit
outside and kill her."

01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:44.118
Imagine that little girl,

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.948
performing for those killers...

01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:55.171
the fear when she didn't know
the song,

01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:59.742
the terror...

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:02.225
when she thought
she was about to be shot.

01:09:05.924 --> 01:09:10.926
My grandfather took the little
girl outside, as ordered,

01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:13.886
but he couldn't kill her.

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:19.196
Instead he found a way out
from the camp

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:23.246
and he told her,
"Run! Never look back."

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:29.814
Well, my grandfather
survived the war,

01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:33.299
but he never touched
his violin ever again.

01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:41.871
Would you mind...

01:09:41.872 --> 01:09:44.397
playing the Courante for me?

01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:10.266
Thank you.

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:17.098
Wait, I don't even know
your name.

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:24.367
It's perfect that way,
isn't it?

01:12:02.405 --> 01:12:06.842
Mr. Leonetti, Detective
Michael Connolly, Cleveland P.D.

01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:09.105
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

01:12:09.107 --> 01:12:10.541
This could be done
another time.

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:12.064
You always attend the funerals
of people who die

01:12:12.066 --> 01:12:13.544
on your watch,
Detective Connolly?

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:15.851
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mr. Leonetti,

01:12:15.853 --> 01:12:19.245
it's just that Mr. Puccinaldi's
last words were of you.

01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:22.336
He said he wasn't willing
to die to protect you.

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.468
Do you have any idea
what he might have meant?

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:26.949
Alright, that's enough.
Leave Mr. Leonetti alone!

01:12:26.951 --> 01:12:29.345
Now, now, now, Albert,
Albert please, please.

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:36.785
Look, Detective Connolly,

01:12:36.787 --> 01:12:39.265
Mr. Puccinaldi
was a childhood friend,

01:12:39.267 --> 01:12:42.051
and I am truly devastated
over his tragic death,

01:12:42.053 --> 01:12:45.228
as well as the revelation
that apparently he hadn't put

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:48.362
the habits of his juvenile
delinquent past behind him.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.320
But if you're on
a wild goose chase

01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:53.323
to somehow link
his criminal activities to me,

01:12:53.325 --> 01:12:55.458
there'll be consequences.

01:12:58.548 --> 01:13:00.506
Tell your captain.

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:04.421
What consequences
am I telling him, sir?

01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:05.555
Let's go.

01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:58.100
I need an ID on
8900 Chestnut Road.

01:14:58.102 --> 01:15:00.494
Stand by.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:04.062
Private residence,
one Angelo J. Leonetti.

01:15:04.064 --> 01:15:05.805
Alright, copy.

01:15:11.942 --> 01:15:13.419
We're in the eighth inning,

01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:16.727
and so far it's been
a very tight game.

01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:19.776
Two outs,
with a runner on first base...

01:15:42.059 --> 01:15:44.668
Thanks, buddy.
Have a good night.

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:45.887
I'll see ya in the morning.

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:17.573
Good evening.

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:24.188
A little Scotch neat?

01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:27.104
Yeah.

01:16:31.761 --> 01:16:34.067
25 Mac, yeah?

01:16:36.766 --> 01:16:38.287
- Thanks.
- Salude.

01:16:38.289 --> 01:16:39.595
Salude.

01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:46.558
I thought Jack did
his own wet work.

01:16:48.865 --> 01:16:50.606
Fuckin' Mick.

01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:55.173
So...

01:16:55.175 --> 01:16:57.961
I didn't know you served
two masters, Schlychter.

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:03.268
Well, I gotta hand it
to both of ya,

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:05.270
'cause not much surprises me.

01:17:05.272 --> 01:17:07.838
But this...
this explains a little bit.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.191
Like Cohen's body bein'
left for the cops to find.

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:25.595
I'll double whatever
he's paying ya.

01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:27.728
I'm sorry.

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:31.601
Compensation
is not the sole issue here.

01:17:31.603 --> 01:17:33.385
Oh, integrity?
You?

01:17:40.568 --> 01:17:42.440
Okay.

01:17:43.963 --> 01:17:47.182
Carmen. Yeah, yeah.

01:17:47.184 --> 01:17:50.881
Crossed my mind that
that might rankle your code.

01:17:50.883 --> 01:17:54.232
He was a likable little fucker,
wasn't he, huh? Ha.

01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:57.932
I loved him, though.
I did, I loved him.

01:17:57.934 --> 01:17:59.326
You don't mind if I smoke,
do ya?

01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:03.504
Heh.

01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:26.136
We ran a tight ship,
didn't we?

01:18:27.311 --> 01:18:30.573
We sure did, Mr. Leonetti.

01:18:30.575 --> 01:18:34.751
But eventually someone's
gotta pay the piper, right?

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:38.320
Fuck you, Schlychter,
you Kraut bastard.

01:18:38.322 --> 01:18:40.931
Son of a...

01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:45.111
Might be a Kraut,
but I'm not stupid.

01:19:09.962 --> 01:19:11.572
Police!

01:19:36.075 --> 01:19:37.988
Freeze!

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:42.210
Attack! Go!

01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:49.915
Klaus! Enough.

01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:58.226
You don't work for Leonetti.

01:19:58.228 --> 01:20:01.492
I did, but he's retired.

01:20:04.147 --> 01:20:06.277
You better start thinking.

01:20:06.279 --> 01:20:09.759
Your decisions affect
more than just you.

01:20:09.761 --> 01:20:12.283
You see, I have another
assignment for tonight.

01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:21.205
Klaus, you traitor.

01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:24.297
Come on, let's go.

01:20:26.952 --> 01:20:30.086
It's a beautiful night.

01:20:34.742 --> 01:20:36.917
Michael?

01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:39.833
Michael.

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:42.574
I don't want you
disappearing like Kitchen.

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:47.492
I'll tell you everything
you wanna know about Angelo Leonetti.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.454
You always
attend the funerals of people

01:20:52.456 --> 01:20:54.980
who die on your watch,
Detective?

01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:02.681
Who do you think has to bury you?

01:21:07.297 --> 01:21:11.212
Your father had a vision,

01:21:11.214 --> 01:21:14.693
the man that
he wanted you to be,

01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:17.261
and that wasn't a lie.

01:21:17.263 --> 01:21:20.743
You've gotta
find a way to forgive him.

01:21:24.967 --> 01:21:28.359
Hey. Hey, kid.

01:21:28.361 --> 01:21:31.319
- Wake up, kid. Hey, you dead?
- Ahh.

01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:33.625
Jesus, hell of a place
to take a nap.

01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:36.411
Easy now, cowboy.
We had a 911. Shots fired.

01:21:36.413 --> 01:21:39.240
Were some of them yours?

01:21:39.242 --> 01:21:42.591
- I saw the shooter.
- Yeah, I know, we're on it.

01:21:42.593 --> 01:21:44.332
He may still be in the area.

01:21:44.334 --> 01:21:46.073
No, he's not.

01:21:46.075 --> 01:21:49.554
Kid! Where the fuck you going?

01:21:55.867 --> 01:21:58.302
- Cap, Leonetti's dead.
- What happened?

01:21:58.304 --> 01:22:00.391
Shot in his house.
I got there right after

01:22:00.393 --> 01:22:02.132
and went after the perp,
but he got away.

01:22:02.134 --> 01:22:04.178
Okay, where are you?

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:07.268
I'm heading back to the station
to get an APB on the shooter.

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:09.531
Alright, I can call that in from here.
Come on over.

01:22:09.533 --> 01:22:14.057
Okay, we got a white male,
fifties, black Jaguar,

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:17.582
Ohio plates P K Y 7 2 K.

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:19.671
I'm five away.

01:22:30.162 --> 01:22:32.599
- Cap!
- In the kitchen.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.558
- Fuck.
- You look like shit.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.168
Yeah, well, I had help.

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:39.778
I should see the other guy,
right?

01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:41.171
Yeah, well,
I did see the other guy,

01:22:41.173 --> 01:22:42.694
- I can ID this guy...
- Which, by the way,

01:22:42.696 --> 01:22:44.740
I owe you an apology
on Leonetti.

01:22:44.742 --> 01:22:46.568
He was in this after all...
You like this black, right?

01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:50.050
Yeah, yeah. Listen,
this guy is tying up loose ends.

01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:52.356
He's gonna leave town.
He knows what I look like...

01:22:52.358 --> 01:22:54.141
Michael, I know, I know.

01:22:54.143 --> 01:22:56.754
They filled me in when I called
in the APB on Schlychter.

01:23:06.677 --> 01:23:09.373
Mikey, do you remember when
your dad and I took you

01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:12.289
to Municipal Stadium
to see the Indians play

01:23:12.291 --> 01:23:14.467
on your seventh birthday?

01:23:15.642 --> 01:23:18.078
It was cloudy out...

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.821
and you were concerned that
it was gonna get rained out.

01:23:22.823 --> 01:23:26.216
Do you remember what your dad
said to you?

01:23:26.218 --> 01:23:30.875
He said, "No way am I gonna let
it rain on my son's birthday."

01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:36.879
And sure enough, I'll be damned
if the sun didn't come out.

01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:38.665
Schlychter.

01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:42.539
I never said his name.

01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:46.064
I know.

01:23:48.893 --> 01:23:51.546
Guess Kitchen figured it out
too, huh?

01:23:51.548 --> 01:23:54.418
No.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.812
Kitchen wanted a bigger cut
to keep from snitching

01:23:56.814 --> 01:24:00.076
to Leonetti that
I had had him tip off Cohen

01:24:00.078 --> 01:24:01.991
to the drug transfer
to begin with.

01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:04.863
So Cohen took the bait
and stole your drugs,

01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:08.173
giving you the excuse
to take Leonetti down.

01:24:10.523 --> 01:24:14.005
And I'm the dumb rookie cop
you threw on the case.

01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:19.054
You're not as dumb
as I thought you were.

01:24:22.318 --> 01:24:26.061
However, you did walk in here
without your gun, Michael.

01:24:29.847 --> 01:24:32.021
Mikey...

01:24:32.023 --> 01:24:35.938
I'll give you Kitchen's 20%.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:39.857
We take over Leonetti's
territory, we make a killing.

01:24:44.862 --> 01:24:48.037
I'm sorry, Cap.

01:24:48.039 --> 01:24:50.868
Dirty cop's not
my five-year plan.

01:24:53.305 --> 01:24:56.134
Schlychter said he had
one more assignment.

01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:03.139
What was it, Cap?

01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:04.749
You.

01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:06.142
- Ohh!
- Unhh!

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.724
- Unhh!
- Ahhh!

01:25:28.558 --> 01:25:32.127
I hated having to kill
your father, Mikey.

01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:38.568
Klaus, go!

01:25:39.612 --> 01:25:41.046
Schlychter!

01:25:47.925 --> 01:25:50.971
Klaus, enough.

01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:56.801
Your fuckin' dog can't
even follow a command.

01:25:56.803 --> 01:26:00.457
Well, he did, you asshole.

01:26:00.459 --> 01:26:03.243
You fuckin' Kraut.

01:26:03.245 --> 01:26:06.422
Yeah, I keep getting that. Hmm.

01:26:27.094 --> 01:26:29.184
I'm sorry, Mikey.

01:26:46.723 --> 01:26:48.942
Nice shot.

01:26:51.118 --> 01:26:55.340
He was planning to kill me
after I killed you.

01:26:59.997 --> 01:27:03.607
You could've taken me out.
Twice.

01:27:03.609 --> 01:27:07.089
Oh, more than that.

01:27:07.091 --> 01:27:10.701
Why didn't you?

01:27:10.703 --> 01:27:16.185
Because we both descend
from misjudged men,

01:27:16.187 --> 01:27:18.537
and you're an honorable one.

01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:24.326
Oh, and Klaus likes you.

01:27:29.635 --> 01:27:32.812
I'll give you 10 minutes
before I call it in.

01:27:34.074 --> 01:27:35.944
Is that a warning?

01:27:35.946 --> 01:27:38.165
It's a head start.

01:28:27.824 --> 01:28:31.697
I got something to tell you.

01:28:38.487 --> 01:28:40.706
I hate eggs.

01:28:44.144 --> 01:28:46.408
You hate eggs?

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:54.631
But... you love my Sunday morning
omelets.

01:28:54.633 --> 01:28:57.332
I lied. I can't stand 'em.

01:29:04.382 --> 01:29:06.904
Alright, it's your turn.

01:29:06.906 --> 01:29:09.733
I like fortune cookies

01:29:09.735 --> 01:29:12.954
that actually give you
a fortune,

01:29:12.956 --> 01:29:15.435
like tell me I'm going
on a trip, or...

01:29:15.437 --> 01:29:18.089
- Yeah. Yeah.
- like, I'm gonna win the lottery or something.

01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:20.180
Yeah.

01:29:35.152 --> 01:29:37.457
The thumb drive that
you took from Jack's house

01:29:37.459 --> 01:29:40.024
has evidence on at least
half my open cases.

01:29:40.026 --> 01:29:42.070
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

01:29:42.072 --> 01:29:45.203
I'll remember. Next time.

01:29:45.205 --> 01:29:48.598
Listen, go home,
put your feet up,

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.905
it'll still be there tomorrow.

01:29:50.907 --> 01:29:53.300
- Hey, Connolly.
- Yeah?

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.565
You done good.

01:29:59.002 --> 01:30:01.089
Divers are ready.
Where do you want 'em?

01:30:01.091 --> 01:30:03.004
We gotta cover it all,
so start at the dock

01:30:03.006 --> 01:30:04.266
and sweep your way out.

01:30:04.268 --> 01:30:05.398
Copy that.

01:30:07.576 --> 01:30:09.273
Hey, guys, so listen...

01:30:12.711 --> 01:30:14.319
So you heard?

01:30:14.321 --> 01:30:18.106
This Schlychter guy...
FBI, Interpol,

01:30:18.108 --> 01:30:20.282
there's no record of him.

01:30:20.284 --> 01:30:22.197
Ten-to-one they never find him.

01:30:22.199 --> 01:30:24.329
Yeah, that's
a pretty good bet.

01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:26.070
Internal Affairs
had a field day

01:30:26.072 --> 01:30:27.724
with that thumb drive, though.

01:30:27.726 --> 01:30:29.944
It's got Jack on the
phone ordering executions,

01:30:29.946 --> 01:30:32.163
from Leonetti all the way down.

01:30:32.165 --> 01:30:34.731
You were the last of 'em.

01:30:34.733 --> 01:30:38.300
But you know, if Jack
would've been thinking,

01:30:38.302 --> 01:30:40.824
he'd have called me.

01:30:40.826 --> 01:30:43.566
I'd have killed you for free.

01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:46.743
Well, with your aim,
I think I'd be safe.

01:30:46.745 --> 01:30:48.878
Yeah, right.

01:30:56.538 --> 01:30:58.451
I'm interviewing
the witness later today.

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:00.585
Okay.

01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:19.430
Did you know him?

01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:22.607
He's my father.

01:31:23.913 --> 01:31:25.913
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:31:25.915 --> 01:31:28.395
You must be proud of him.

01:31:33.052 --> 01:31:35.096
Yeah.

01:31:35.098 --> 01:31:36.621
I am.
