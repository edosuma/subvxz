Emma, come on.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.420
(car engine starts)

16:46.172 --> 16:49.259
Mam says you can stay
if we want to try again.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.721
Try and make it work.

16:52.804 --> 16:53.638
For them.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.849
Uh, I have to go.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.736
EMMA:
Oh, look. That is so cool.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.409
Don't, don't touch that.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.327
You're asking a thousand
for this?

17:16.411 --> 17:18.329
LANDLORD:
It's cheap for the area.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.665
I'll take rent allowance,
and it's available.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.292
Of course it's available.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.169
LANDLORD: We'll obviously fix
the electrics,

17:24.252 --> 17:27.046
paint it up a bit,
before you move in.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.048
I'd rather stick my head
in there.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.595
Bleeding disgrace.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.395
EMMA:
Bleeding disgrace.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.980
SANDRA:
You're a bleeding disgrace.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.523
Uh, sorry, you're the disgrace.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.192
(chuckles)

17:47.275 --> 17:48.985
(exclaims)

17:49.068 --> 17:52.739
Here, go on and mind Molly,
and watch the cars.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.974
(Molly screaming)

18:20.058 --> 18:23.144
Ah! Oh, my God.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.605
I'm dead as... (groans)

18:25.688 --> 18:27.816
MOLLY: You can't be dead.
We need you for chips!

18:27.899 --> 18:29.067
(Emma giggles)

18:29.150 --> 18:30.693
-Tickle her.
-MOLLY: Tickle her.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.028
(all chuckling)

18:32.111 --> 18:34.489
SANDRA:
Please stop.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.950
-Mummy is...
-MOLLY: Under the arms.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.785
SANDRA:
Come here, you little messers!

18:38.868 --> 18:40.578
Yous only need me for chips,
do yous?

18:40.662 --> 18:42.205
-EMMA: Hmm. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.374
SANDRA: All right. That's it.
I'm gonna eat you! (growls)

18:44.457 --> 18:45.875
(all chuckling and squealing)

18:45.959 --> 18:47.669
All right.
Do yous want some real chips?

18:47.752 --> 18:48.795
-Yeah.
-MOLLY: Yeah.

18:48.878 --> 18:49.796
All right. Come on.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.098
(whispering): Do you want
to hear a bedtime story

19:00.181 --> 19:01.599
about Saint Brigid?

19:04.435 --> 19:06.771
(sighs)
Yeah. Go on.

19:06.855 --> 19:11.442
So, Brigid prays to God
and says,

19:11.526 --> 19:15.113
"Will You make the king
of Ireland's heart all soft?

19:15.196 --> 19:19.242
'Cause it's gone icy
and like a rock or something."

19:19.325 --> 19:22.954
And God did, and she smiled
and said to the king,

19:23.037 --> 19:28.209
"Will you give me as much land
as this cloak will cover?"

19:28.293 --> 19:29.919
'Cause she was wearing
this cloak,

19:30.003 --> 19:31.170
just normal size, right?

19:31.254 --> 19:34.215
She bends down,
and the cloak is magic,

19:34.299 --> 19:36.134
with the Holy God Spirit in it,

19:36.217 --> 19:38.219
and she tells her four sisters
with her...

19:38.303 --> 19:40.680
They were like
her sidekicks, right?

19:40.763 --> 19:42.765
They take a corner each
and spread it out

19:42.849 --> 19:44.601
all over the land,

19:44.684 --> 19:47.604
and it goes out for miles.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.064
It's just like a miracle.

19:50.148 --> 19:53.776
And then the king says,
"Well, Brigid, what's the story?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.445
How'd you do that?"

19:55.528 --> 19:58.323
And Brigid says, "It's 'cause
you're being so stingy

19:58.406 --> 20:00.742
with all the poor people
in your land."

20:00.825 --> 20:04.245
And he says, "All right, then,
you can have loads of me land."

20:04.329 --> 20:07.040
And she gets it
and starts a convent

20:07.123 --> 20:09.459
and helps all the people
in the town.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.920
They start a farm
where they made jam

20:12.003 --> 20:13.838
with the berries on the land.

20:13.922 --> 20:17.842
Hmm, like a little
community center type of thing.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.345
But then everyone was grand.

20:20.428 --> 20:24.057
How do you remember all that?

20:24.140 --> 20:26.184
I don't like the way
my teacher says it,

20:26.267 --> 20:27.852
so I remember it my own way.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.480
She's got a real moany voice.

You'll learn as you build.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.120
You need very, very few skills

22:51.204 --> 22:52.789
to be part of a team

22:52.872 --> 22:54.665
that'll build a house.

Pass on the skills
to your children.

(choral music continues)

23:06.260 --> 23:07.178
What can I do for you?

23:07.261 --> 23:09.764
I want to build a house.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.350
Um, these are some
of the vacant sites

23:12.433 --> 23:14.227
that you have going spare.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.105
And the addresses
are on the back.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.273
And this is how much
it would cost me

23:19.357 --> 23:22.360
for the materials and a plumber
and an electrician.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.195
It's 35,000 euro.

23:24.278 --> 23:27.782
You see, I figured out
that I cost you 33,000

23:27.865 --> 23:30.618
in rent and welfare
in one year alone.

23:30.701 --> 23:34.205
Um... And at number 653
on the housing list,

23:34.288 --> 23:36.124
that's three or four years
keeping us in hotels,

23:36.207 --> 23:39.043
which would cost you 120,000,

23:39.127 --> 23:40.962
maybe even more.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.089
But if you lend me the money

23:43.172 --> 23:45.341
and let me use a site,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.093
then I could have that built
by Christmas,

23:47.176 --> 23:50.763
and be paying you rent
for the house.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.890
Do you see what I mean?

23:52.974 --> 23:55.059
(exhales)

23:56.686 --> 23:58.813
You'd even be making a profit.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.316

Dr. O'Toole?

Hello? Can you hear me?

25:07.340 --> 25:08.549
Dr. O'Toole?

25:08.633 --> 25:09.884
Listen, it's Sandra,
your cleaner.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.177
Wake up. Come on.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.350
-Peggy?
-Yeah.

25:17.433 --> 25:18.643
Oh, thank God.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.813
Dr. O'Toole, it's me.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.941
-Will I call an ambulance?
-(groans)

25:26.025 --> 25:27.193
No.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.653
-No. I probably should.
-No, no, no.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.905
-Just to be safe.
-No. It's fine.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.990
Stop fussing.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.826
I must have fainted.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.870
I've not been able to eat.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.789
Are you sure now?
'Cause you have a cut.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.541
No. Well, if I was a horse,
they'd shoot me, but I'm not.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.461
I'm a doctor, and I'd know if
I needed to go to the hospital.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.047
So help me get up.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.715
-Okay.
-Give me a hand.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.175
Here. You ready?

25:51.259 --> 25:53.803
(both grunting)

25:53.886 --> 25:56.722
Right. All good. I'm just gonna
walk you back here.

25:56.806 --> 25:57.765
Right. Easy.

25:57.848 --> 26:00.268
Sit down there now. Yeah.

26:00.351 --> 26:01.978
-(Peggy groans)
-Are you all right?

26:02.061 --> 26:04.105
-Hmm.
-Okay.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.815
Do you feel dizzy or anything?

26:08.276 --> 26:11.112
Why didn't you ask me?

26:11.195 --> 26:13.030
Ask you?

26:13.114 --> 26:14.365
Ask you what?

26:15.616 --> 26:17.368
I have designed a house

26:17.451 --> 26:21.205
that costs just 35,000 euros
to build.

26:21.289 --> 26:23.124
It's a self-build,

26:23.207 --> 26:27.044
so you can literally DIY
a permanent home.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.966
I didn't mean for you
to see that.

26:32.049 --> 26:35.678
Well, I did, so...

26:35.761 --> 26:37.972
here's my proposal.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.073
(birds chirping)

27:06.792 --> 27:09.712
PEGGY: It's land, Sandra,
going to waste.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.839
Use it.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.966
Build a house for you
and your girls.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.762
Dr. O'Toole, this...

27:21.682 --> 27:23.851
Why would you do this?

27:23.934 --> 27:26.562
PEGGY: Your mother was far more
than a cleaner to me.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.232
She was a friend.

27:32.109 --> 27:35.654
She helped me through
some bloody awful times.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.743
I want to give you the land...

27:40.826 --> 27:43.120
and lend you the money
to build your house.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.541
(sniffles)
Not this much.

27:49.126 --> 27:52.630
-You can't.
-I can.

27:52.713 --> 27:56.801
And you can pay me back over
as many years as, as we decide.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.222
Hmm? What do you say?

28:08.145 --> 28:09.313
(exhales sharply)

28:11.399 --> 28:13.025
Is that a yes?

28:15.986 --> 28:18.614
Uh, yeah.
(laughs shakily)

28:18.697 --> 28:21.367
(sniffles)
Yeah.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.202
(chuckles)

28:23.285 --> 28:24.662
All right, now get back to work.

28:24.745 --> 28:25.871
Good woman.

28:32.420 --> 28:35.047
(birds chirping)

28:38.134 --> 28:41.929
CIARAN:
These are approximate figures,

28:42.012 --> 28:44.932
so you need to check
all the costs

28:45.015 --> 28:46.851
before you commit.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.436
Where'd you get this?

28:48.519 --> 28:51.564
-Uh, online.
-Online. (sighs)

28:51.647 --> 28:54.650
Are these costs
inclusive of VAT?

28:54.733 --> 28:57.027
Value added tax-- are these
prices plus or including?

28:57.111 --> 28:59.113
Yeah, I-I think-- I-I'd say so.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.782
'Cause there's a big difference.

29:01.866 --> 29:02.825
Yeah, I know.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.702
I'll be with you in a sec there.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.665
Onduline.
Don't know what that is.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.709
Do you know what thickness
of insulation it is?

29:11.792 --> 29:13.294
There's loads of sizes, like.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.880
Oh, yeah, no, uh...
I'll-I'll ask.

29:15.963 --> 29:18.382
Biobase.
Never heard of it.

29:18.466 --> 29:21.802
Wha-What about, um, like,
basic concrete?

29:21.886 --> 29:23.137
Well, that's actual ready mix.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.306
It's-it's not bags?

29:25.389 --> 29:27.516
No. Concrete would-would have
to come

29:27.600 --> 29:28.934
in a truck, in cubic meters.

29:29.018 --> 29:30.728
You'd have to go to Roadstone.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.688
Do you mind
if I serve this fella?

29:32.771 --> 29:35.065
Yes, my friend,
what can I get you?

29:37.151 --> 29:40.070
Some manners, a bit of courtesy.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.947
-What?
-What?

29:42.031 --> 29:44.492
You're Customer Service.
Serve the customer.

29:44.575 --> 29:47.161
She's only after a price check.
It's not rocket science.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.714
You're throwing away
the good bit.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.811
Can I ask your advice
on something?

30:14.271 --> 30:16.857
I'm building a house,
like a self-build.

30:16.941 --> 30:20.361
-Right.
-And I'm only starting, but...

30:20.444 --> 30:22.404
I don't know where to start,
I suppose.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.620
Where's your site?
Have you got a field?

30:29.703 --> 30:32.540
A back garden. A woman I work
for is giving me the land.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.625
Giving you it?
Why is she doing that?

30:34.708 --> 30:36.961
Trying not to think about it
too much.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.420
I would.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.006
Nobody does anything for
nothing, not in this country.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.260
Well, I wouldn't live in it,

30:44.343 --> 30:46.971
but it's a roof and four walls,

30:47.054 --> 30:48.222
so what else do you need?

30:50.307 --> 30:51.642
You wouldn't come
and have a look,

30:51.725 --> 30:53.143
-would you?
-No, I can't, love.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.937
I have a flue to install,

30:55.020 --> 30:56.730
on a job that's growing arms
and legs.

30:56.814 --> 30:57.898
It's only around the corner.

30:57.982 --> 30:59.275
I can't help you.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.526
I can't afford to.

31:03.404 --> 31:06.323
Look, you don't know me,

31:06.407 --> 31:09.994
but I think you worked
with my ex Gary.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.495
Gary Mullen?

31:19.211 --> 31:21.130
(birds chirping)

31:43.068 --> 31:45.404
-It's possible.
-PEGGY: But?

31:45.487 --> 31:47.615
You're gonna need somebody
who knows what they're doing.

31:47.698 --> 31:48.991
He means a man.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.367
No, I mean a person
who's qualified

31:50.451 --> 31:54.038
to handle compliances,
put in for planning.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.581
Could you be that person?

31:55.664 --> 31:56.624
I don't do contracts.

31:59.627 --> 32:02.004

a consultancy fee or--

even if you do get planning,

32:06.717 --> 32:08.636
I'm guessing you're gonna want
somebody who's gonna work

32:08.719 --> 32:10.387
every weekend
for next to nothing.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.057
I'm no use to you.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.726
And I've just had
a health scare. Dicky ticker.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.062
-GRAINNE: There you are!
-PEGGY: Grainne!

32:18.145 --> 32:20.689
Have a word
with the architect, yeah?

32:20.773 --> 32:22.191
See if he has any ideas.

I'm sorry, can't help you.

to be convalescing?

32:28.322 --> 32:30.616
What are you doing?

32:30.699 --> 32:33.202
Sorry, but do you know each
other well enough to do this?

32:33.285 --> 32:34.912
She's Michelle's daughter.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.246
And Michelle was lovely

32:36.330 --> 32:38.999
and a really good cleaner,
but...

32:39.083 --> 32:40.584
But what?

32:40.668 --> 32:42.753
She used to help herself
to Dad's whiskey.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.589
(laughs) Well, she did us all
a favor there.

32:45.673 --> 32:46.924
I'm sorry, Sandra,

32:47.007 --> 32:48.676
could I just have a moment
with Mum?

32:48.759 --> 32:49.885
No, Sandra, stay.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.930
GRAINNE:
Look, at the end of the day,

32:53.013 --> 32:54.807
it's none of my business.
I get it.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.686
It's your land, your choice,
but...

33:02.606 --> 33:04.608
What are you gonna do
about Aisling's den?

33:04.692 --> 33:08.112
-PEGGY: Knock it down.
-SANDRA: I'll let you...

33:08.195 --> 33:09.655
-I-I shouldn't be...
-PEGGY: No, Sandra.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.365

CIARAN: You've only got to say
"self-build" to a builder,

34:02.291 --> 34:04.293
and he'll run a mile.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.086
But you are gonna need
an expert.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.921
Honestly,

34:08.005 --> 34:10.299
the only person that would
do this for nothing is me,

34:10.382 --> 34:11.925
and I'm not back
till next year.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.309
We're in temporary

Hmm. Yeah.

Uh, you're still one parent,

36:56.131 --> 36:57.507
and he's been keeping up
on the maintenance, has he?

36:57.591 --> 36:58.884
Yeah, he has, yeah.
No difference.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.094
It's grand.
Just, the maintenance affects

gets calculated.

Yeah, no, I-I remember.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.367
and this is really
important, right...

38:05.450 --> 38:06.827
we can't tell anyone.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.745

Aido the builder said.

38:18.714 --> 38:20.757

and you've seen him, right?

38:20.841 --> 38:22.634
-Mm-hmm. -You don't want
to mess with him, do you?

38:22.718 --> 38:23.969
-No.
-EMMA: No.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.804
So we have to keep this
to ourselves, yeah?

38:25.887 --> 38:28.807
Our own special secret.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.392

38:32.102 --> 38:33.395

42:15.033 --> 42:17.994
SANDRA:
Emma. Take your sister inside.

42:18.078 --> 42:19.621
-Emma, go on.
-Come on.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.499
EMMA:
Come on, Molly.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.092
Sandra, look,
I just wanted to...

42:32.175 --> 42:33.051
What are you doing?

42:33.134 --> 42:36.263
Yeah. I made you dinner.
Take it.

42:36.346 --> 42:38.139
You're not supposed to be here.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.141
I'm not asking to come in
and eat with yous,

42:40.225 --> 42:42.394
Sandra, geez...

42:42.477 --> 42:45.188
I just want them
to have a hot meal.

42:45.272 --> 42:47.399
And you could use one, too.
You're wasting away there.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.159
Thanks.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.620
It's mad, isn't it?

43:00.704 --> 43:03.790
We could all just get
into that car now.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.500
Together. We could just go back.

43:08.128 --> 43:09.629
To what, Gary?

43:15.260 --> 43:17.095
I don't know what's happened.

43:28.356 --> 43:30.483
GARY: Oh, that's
a great idea, Sandra.

43:30.567 --> 43:34.195
End up some lonely fuckup
like your ma!

43:34.279 --> 43:36.865

44:38.093 --> 44:39.469

44:39.552 --> 44:42.263
Taking an action shot
for me Instagram.

44:42.347 --> 44:43.556
Throw that in there again.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.058
No! No photos, Amy.

44:45.141 --> 44:47.435
Not of me or the kids
or the site, all right?

44:47.519 --> 44:49.270
And don't put nothing online.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.439
All right. Relax.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.274
Just thought you wanted
to document the thing

44:53.358 --> 44:54.984
like you were
on Grand Designs, no?

44:55.068 --> 44:56.778
No.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.203
AIDO:
Far end.

45:05.286 --> 45:07.038
That's it. Side to side,
and towards yourself.

45:07.122 --> 45:08.706
We don't want any dips
in the middle.

45:08.790 --> 45:11.459
We don't want the water
to run off the edges, you know.

45:11.543 --> 45:12.460
Keep coming towards yourself.

45:12.544 --> 45:14.462
Side to side, up and down.

45:16.756 --> 45:20.552

45:27.142 --> 45:28.393

for nerve damage.

45:33.648 --> 45:36.234
Yeah. Well, it helps.

45:36.317 --> 45:39.696
MOLLY: Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma,
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.906
-Look what I made.
-Lovely, love.

45:41.990 --> 45:43.324
-Uh, Molly?
-Yeah.

45:43.408 --> 45:44.868
I think you need the loo.

45:44.951 --> 45:46.244
No, I don't.

45:46.327 --> 45:47.871
I can see you holding it in.

45:47.954 --> 45:48.955
Go on.

45:50.206 --> 45:52.709
-You all right, Sandra?
-(exhales)

45:52.792 --> 45:55.044
Listen, we're gonna need
more people next weekend.

45:55.128 --> 45:57.964
We can't keep going with three.
Okay?

45:58.047 --> 45:59.632
Yeah. All right.

46:07.223 --> 46:08.975
Sorry?

46:09.058 --> 46:12.187
Um, this is a bit mad,
but I'm building a house,

46:12.270 --> 46:15.982
like, uh, a self-build thing,
and I need a hand

46:16.065 --> 46:17.358
for a few weekends
over the summer.

46:17.442 --> 46:18.818
And I was wondering, like--

46:18.902 --> 46:21.279
and only if it suits
and if you're around,

46:21.362 --> 46:24.365
um, if, if you'd want to help?

46:24.449 --> 46:25.867
Oh, here, I should--
I should, uh...

46:25.950 --> 46:26.993
(school bell ringing)

46:27.076 --> 46:28.786
...write it down for you,
um, it's...

46:28.870 --> 46:31.498
Look, I know I've not been...

46:31.581 --> 46:33.124
Like, I know that
we've not talked much,

46:33.208 --> 46:34.834
but you just always...

46:35.960 --> 46:38.338
Look, here's the address, um...

46:38.421 --> 46:40.840
And, like, there's no pressure.

46:40.924 --> 46:43.301
You're probably busy
or going away.

46:44.928 --> 46:47.180
-Oy!
-MOLLY: We got to watch Moana

46:47.263 --> 46:48.223
and play games.

46:48.306 --> 46:49.557
SANDRA:
You did?

46:49.641 --> 46:52.936
So, look, I-I'll l-leave it
with you anyway.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.145
Thanks.

46:54.229 --> 46:57.106

47:00.568 --> 47:02.153

47:02.237 --> 47:03.279
MOLLY:
No. No.

47:03.363 --> 47:04.697
SANDRA:
Get out of the wardrobe.

47:04.781 --> 47:08.535
-No, I don't want to go.
-We have to go.

47:08.618 --> 47:10.370
Dad won't let her watch Frozen.

47:10.453 --> 47:12.580

47:12.664 --> 47:14.332
SANDRA: Molly, will you let go
of the handle?

47:14.415 --> 47:15.416
(tearfully):
No.

47:15.500 --> 47:16.918
Molly, you might trap
your finger.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.127
No.

47:18.211 --> 47:19.837
SANDRA:
Come on. Enough.

47:19.921 --> 47:22.757

47:22.840 --> 47:25.218

47:25.301 --> 47:26.803
Come here.

47:26.886 --> 47:30.014

47:30.098 --> 47:33.643

-MOLLY: No. No.

47:33.726 --> 47:37.146
Come here to me, pet. Come here.

47:37.230 --> 47:41.985
It's all right. It's okay.
Come here, I'm so sorry.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.361
What's wrong?

47:44.862 --> 47:48.116
Molly, do you want to play
with Pony?

47:48.199 --> 47:50.368
Did you take that from Peggy's?

47:50.451 --> 47:53.913
No, she gave it to us.
It was Aisling's.

47:53.997 --> 47:57.292
Aisling's up in heaven
with Granny Michelle.

47:59.085 --> 48:01.588
Do you want to stay
with me today, Molly?

48:01.671 --> 48:02.880
Yeah.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.342
She's not herself.

48:06.426 --> 48:08.720
Could be a kidney infection.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.763
So she wants to stay with me.

48:26.821 --> 48:29.324

stop, will you calm down?

48:35.496 --> 48:36.623
You're being a baby!

48:36.706 --> 48:37.957
Gary, don't hurt her.

48:38.041 --> 48:39.667
Oh, the only reason
she's acting up

48:39.751 --> 48:41.461
is 'cause she knows
she can get what she wants.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.755
Now, she's messing both of us
about here, Sandra.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.175

or 3.4 meters.

50:04.419 --> 50:08.214
Each column is made up of
seven different pieces of wood.

Two are the same, at the top,
two are the same in the middle,

50:11.676 --> 50:13.886

this little one home.

-What, are they the wrong ones?
-No, but they're dearer.

55:47.678 --> 55:49.889
You can get big boxes
in Goodwin's for half the price.

55:49.972 --> 55:51.348
You need to think
about your budget, Sandra.

55:51.432 --> 55:53.350

-Emma, you're not supposed

You know that.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.230
Go on.

55:58.314 --> 56:00.149
I thought this was supposed
to be a self-build,

56:00.232 --> 56:01.650

every-ten-minutes build.

56:01.734 --> 56:03.360

Goodwin's to you.

56:03.444 --> 56:04.612
Yeah, well, I couldn't go there,
all right?

Oh, my God. I cut her arm
with a screw and...

56:50.241 --> 56:52.326
That is a nasty old cut.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.036
Now, Nurse Molly?

56:54.120 --> 56:55.246
-Yeah?
-I have a big brown leather bag

56:55.329 --> 56:56.747

under the stairs.

-MOLLY: Okay. -And, Mummy,
can I have a bowl of warm water?

That's a good girl.

-Give it here.
-(Emma whimpering)

-Now, can you see in there,

-Mm-hmm.

57:40.749 --> 57:43.502
Now, we're coming up
to a big decision now.

57:43.586 --> 57:45.629
We're going to have a plaster
hold this together.

57:45.713 --> 57:47.298
Is it going to be Elsa or Anna?

57:47.381 --> 57:49.133
(tearfully):
Elsa.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.552

want them to see me like this.

58:41.268 --> 58:42.311

But you know,

you just can't.

59:45.332 --> 59:46.917

and a sleep?

59:47.001 --> 59:48.836
I can't.

59:48.919 --> 59:52.464
I can't risk Gary finding
out about this. I can't.

59:52.548 --> 59:54.967
Sandra, darling, we're gonna
have to draw a line here.

59:55.050 --> 59:56.927

running around...

Ah, look. (singing)

1:04:40.961 --> 1:04:43.630
AIDO: Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Tomo, put that down!

1:04:43.714 --> 1:04:45.090
God's sake.

1:04:45.173 --> 1:04:46.842
I have to give two lectures
all the time.

1:04:46.925 --> 1:04:48.844
One for everybody else,
then another one for you.

1:04:48.927 --> 1:04:51.221
You hurt anybody with that,
if you cut somebody's hand off,

1:04:51.305 --> 1:04:53.140
I have no trouble
asking you to leave.

1:04:53.223 --> 1:04:54.766
-Dariusz, take this, will you?
-DARIUSZ: Yeah.

1:04:54.850 --> 1:04:56.852
-Idiot. It's not a playground.
-Relax.

1:04:56.935 --> 1:04:58.854
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1:04:58.937 --> 1:05:00.939
I didn't know you could get
sacked from volunteer work.

1:05:02.858 --> 1:05:04.610
Jesus.

1:05:04.693 --> 1:05:07.154
♪ Bathe in the sunlight ♪

1:05:07.237 --> 1:05:09.656
♪ Don't mind if rain falls ♪

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:13.410
♪ Take me outside,
sit in the green garden ♪

1:05:13.493 --> 1:05:16.121
♪ I'll go wherever you go♪

1:05:16.204 --> 1:05:20.876
♪ Wherever you take me,
I'll go... ♪

1:05:20.959 --> 1:05:23.879
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

1:05:23.962 --> 1:05:26.089
I'm glad you like it.

1:05:26.173 --> 1:05:27.966
-Is this for me?
-Yeah.

1:05:28.050 --> 1:05:31.762
There were some leftovers
of the wood, so...

1:05:31.845 --> 1:05:33.930
Oh, thanks, Peggy.
This looks gorgeous.

1:05:34.014 --> 1:05:35.098
(others affirming)

1:05:35.182 --> 1:05:36.600
Yewande did most of it.

1:05:36.683 --> 1:05:38.852
Oh, no, Peggy.
Come on. We did it together.

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:40.187
Gorgeous, Yewande.

1:05:40.270 --> 1:05:42.230
Yes. It's a Cameroonian
specialty.

1:05:42.314 --> 1:05:43.649
Aido, I'm telling you,

1:05:43.732 --> 1:05:45.275
you don't know
what you're missing, man.

1:05:45.359 --> 1:05:46.985
Oh, come on. It's kondre.

1:05:47.069 --> 1:05:48.570
It's just--
basically, it's a stew

1:05:48.654 --> 1:05:50.614
with some plantain
thrown into it.

1:05:50.697 --> 1:05:52.783
-MOLLY: Plantain?
-Yeah. With a bit of goat.

1:05:52.866 --> 1:05:54.493
(Tomo groans)

1:05:54.576 --> 1:05:56.119
(laughter)

1:05:56.203 --> 1:05:57.496
Come on.

1:05:57.579 --> 1:05:59.706
-Come on, Tomo.
-It's in me mouth now.

1:05:59.790 --> 1:06:01.249
You were enjoying it
a minute ago.

1:06:01.333 --> 1:06:03.835
I mean, you can't... Goat?
Honest, goat?

1:06:03.919 --> 1:06:05.921
It's, it's just the same
as lamb, for heaven's sake.

1:06:06.004 --> 1:06:07.339
Have you never eaten
goat before?

1:06:07.422 --> 1:06:08.548
Lamb, either, no.

1:06:08.632 --> 1:06:10.300
-But you were enjoying it.
-Come on, Tomo.

1:06:10.384 --> 1:06:11.593
That's different.
They-- they're...

1:06:11.677 --> 1:06:13.011
It's only the idea of it.

1:06:13.095 --> 1:06:14.429
(overlapping chatter)

1:06:14.513 --> 1:06:15.722
But then I don't know.

1:06:15.806 --> 1:06:16.723
Yeah, but you're mad
about kebabs.

1:06:16.807 --> 1:06:18.141
Why would you not eat this?

1:06:18.225 --> 1:06:19.559
Yeah, but that's
the Labrador. That's different.

1:06:19.643 --> 1:06:20.727
You were really enjoying it,
so what's changed?

1:06:20.811 --> 1:06:22.479
EMMA:
Labrador? Like a dog?

1:06:22.562 --> 1:06:23.939
YEWANDE:
Have some more, Tomo.

1:06:24.022 --> 1:06:25.774
Yes. Let's give him some more.
Come on.

1:06:25.857 --> 1:06:27.984
No. Don't. No. Look--
All right. I'm all right.

1:06:28.068 --> 1:06:30.487
It's better than the crap
you eat in the squat.

1:06:30.570 --> 1:06:31.780
If you don't know
what you're eating,

1:06:31.863 --> 1:06:33.031
you don't know
what you're eating.

1:06:33.115 --> 1:06:34.741
-But I've been told now.
-Well, you do know

1:06:34.825 --> 1:06:36.827
-what you're eating. -Ah, but
it's in me, it's in me mind now.

1:06:36.910 --> 1:06:37.994
AMY:
You want some salad?

1:06:38.078 --> 1:06:39.705
Yeah, I want to have
a bit of salad.

1:06:39.788 --> 1:06:41.456
-I'll have salad. Yeah.
-Yes, help yourselves to salad.

1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:43.500
Have you got some salad
down there, Molly and Emma?

1:06:43.583 --> 1:06:45.043
MOLLY AND EMMA:
No.

1:06:45.127 --> 1:06:46.670
-No, we don't want any salad.
-You should eat some salad.

1:06:46.753 --> 1:06:48.171
-It can't all be...
-No, we're all right,

1:06:48.255 --> 1:06:49.423
-thanks, for salad.
-Eh, it's all right.

1:06:50.549 --> 1:06:53.885
MOLLY:
It's so far away.

1:06:53.969 --> 1:06:57.389
Ms. Kelly, I had to sign
for this for you.

1:06:59.307 --> 1:07:01.059
Breach of access?

1:07:01.143 --> 1:07:03.520
That prick is lucky
to see those kids at all,

1:07:03.603 --> 1:07:05.605
and now he's taking me to court!

1:07:05.689 --> 1:07:08.191
Breach of access is an offense.

1:07:08.275 --> 1:07:09.818
You have to attend.

1:07:09.901 --> 1:07:11.653
You have to tell your side
of the story.

1:07:11.737 --> 1:07:13.405
Oh, great.
Well, shall I get out me A4 pad

1:07:13.488 --> 1:07:14.573
and we'll get started, will we?

1:07:14.656 --> 1:07:16.783
-Fuck's sake!
-If you fight this

1:07:16.867 --> 1:07:19.745
with that kind of attitude,
he'll win.

1:07:19.828 --> 1:07:21.538
I've seen it, Sandra.

1:07:21.621 --> 1:07:22.998
I've seen men get barring orders

1:07:23.081 --> 1:07:24.416
back against the women
they've hit.

1:07:24.499 --> 1:07:28.420
I'm telling you,
we can either calmly put forward

1:07:28.503 --> 1:07:30.130
your side of the story,

1:07:30.213 --> 1:07:32.716
or you can go into mediation
ranting and raving

1:07:32.799 --> 1:07:35.385
and risk losing custody
of the kids altogether.

1:07:41.516 --> 1:07:43.935
How many visits did Molly miss?

1:07:45.187 --> 1:07:46.480
I don't know.

1:07:48.148 --> 1:07:50.525
Seven? Eight?

1:07:50.609 --> 1:07:52.152
Oh, Jesus, Sandra.

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:54.863
She literally wouldn't get
out of the car, Jo.

1:07:54.946 --> 1:07:56.156
What was I supposed to do?

1:07:56.239 --> 1:07:58.867
You can't let Molly
dictate terms.

1:07:58.950 --> 1:08:01.119
Is that what you say
to a crying child?

1:08:03.330 --> 1:08:07.375
I'm sorry, love, but legally,
he has a right to do this.

1:08:08.502 --> 1:08:10.212
I know it's frustrating.

1:08:15.133 --> 1:08:17.260
Any more news
on the house front?

1:08:18.512 --> 1:08:20.138
No.

1:08:21.723 --> 1:08:24.768
AIDO: This needs to go
up against this porch.

1:08:24.851 --> 1:08:27.103
-Yeah. Got it?
-DARIUSZ: I got it.

1:08:29.147 --> 1:08:31.399
Ah, here's herself. Hello.

1:08:31.483 --> 1:08:33.568
I want one of them
Banham locks for the front door.

1:08:33.652 --> 1:08:35.237
Do you know, do you know
those ones, they,

1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:36.905
like, they flick open
really easy on the inside

1:08:36.988 --> 1:08:38.031
but then they're real secure?

1:08:38.114 --> 1:08:39.282
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know what they are.

1:08:39.366 --> 1:08:41.034
It's just, you're on a budget.

1:08:42.702 --> 1:08:43.912
Well, I want one.

1:08:43.995 --> 1:08:46.206
Well, you can't afford one.

1:08:46.289 --> 1:08:48.124
Jesus.

1:08:48.208 --> 1:08:51.253
Aido, you ask me
for a million decisions a day,

1:08:51.336 --> 1:08:53.630
and then I finally give you
a freebie, and it's--

1:08:53.713 --> 1:08:57.425
and it's fucking "Why, why,
why," or it's, or it's too much.

1:08:57.509 --> 1:08:59.928
Fuck's sake!

1:09:00.011 --> 1:09:01.680
Will you stop looking at me?!
Stop looking at me!

1:09:01.763 --> 1:09:02.931
Just get back on with it,
will you?

1:09:03.014 --> 1:09:05.267
The house is never
gonna get done.

1:09:05.350 --> 1:09:06.434
ROSA:
Sandra.

1:09:08.186 --> 1:09:10.105
SANDRA: Oh, will you stop
bleeding staring at us?

1:09:10.188 --> 1:09:12.774
ROSA: Sandra. Sandra.
What is going on?

1:09:16.027 --> 1:09:18.321
What the fuck is the point?

1:09:18.405 --> 1:09:19.781
(sobs)

1:09:21.324 --> 1:09:23.660
Jesus Christ.

1:09:23.743 --> 1:09:24.786
ROSA:
What?

1:09:24.870 --> 1:09:27.163
I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry.

1:09:32.252 --> 1:09:35.547
(whimpering)

1:09:37.966 --> 1:09:40.468
What is the point of a house...

1:09:41.845 --> 1:09:43.972
...if I have no kids
to put in it?

1:09:54.566 --> 1:09:56.443
Sandra...

1:09:56.526 --> 1:09:57.903
we should go.

1:09:57.986 --> 1:09:59.988
(exhales deeply)

1:10:19.090 --> 1:10:20.383
(sniffs)

1:10:26.014 --> 1:10:28.892
-Maybe I should ring the girls,
just... -Oh, the girls are fine.

1:10:28.975 --> 1:10:32.062
I spoke to Rosa.
They're happy out. You relax.

1:10:44.991 --> 1:10:46.952
I have a present for you.

1:10:49.245 --> 1:10:50.246
From Amy.

1:10:56.962 --> 1:10:58.463
Hope it's only tobacco.

1:11:02.467 --> 1:11:03.385
There's Jo.

1:11:06.346 --> 1:11:09.015
Was there a reason
you didn't leave sooner?

1:11:10.141 --> 1:11:13.103
I... I did try to.

1:11:13.186 --> 1:11:15.563
Uh, I-I wanted to,
loads of times.

1:11:15.647 --> 1:11:18.566
I-I made a safety box.

1:11:18.650 --> 1:11:22.237
I just didn't have
anywhere to go.

1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:24.781
Mr. Mullen, you claim that Molly
hasn't attended access

1:11:24.864 --> 1:11:26.282
on eight occasions?

1:11:26.366 --> 1:11:28.243
-Yes, Judge. -You've been
keeping up maintenance?

1:11:28.326 --> 1:11:29.828
Yes, Judge.

1:11:29.911 --> 1:11:31.496
Okay. Ms. Breen.

1:11:31.579 --> 1:11:32.914
Thank you, Judge.

1:11:32.998 --> 1:11:36.334
Ms. Kelly, last time we spoke,
you described suffering

1:11:36.418 --> 1:11:38.336
psychological and physical abuse

1:11:38.420 --> 1:11:39.754
throughout your relationship.

1:11:39.838 --> 1:11:42.340
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

1:11:42.424 --> 1:11:44.592
And when I specifically
asked you whether Mr. Mullen

1:11:44.676 --> 1:11:46.845
had ever harmed your children,
you said no.

1:11:46.928 --> 1:11:48.138
Is that correct?

1:11:48.221 --> 1:11:49.806
Yes.

1:11:49.889 --> 1:11:53.935
Do you believe he has
harmed them on access visits?

1:11:54.019 --> 1:11:55.979
No.

1:11:56.062 --> 1:11:57.981
BREEN: Your Honor, we have
new evidence to bring to court.

1:11:58.064 --> 1:12:00.817
Articles 1, A to C, are photos

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:02.569
of Mr. Mullen's eldest child
Emma.

1:12:02.652 --> 1:12:06.031
On Sunday, August 7,

1:12:06.114 --> 1:12:08.158
Emma was dropped at her father's
place of residence

1:12:08.241 --> 1:12:10.869
with a bandage on her left arm,
as you can see.

1:12:10.952 --> 1:12:12.662
When questioned about this,
Emma said she hurt it

1:12:12.746 --> 1:12:15.790
"making something
in the garden with Mammy."

1:12:15.874 --> 1:12:17.542
This did not match

1:12:17.625 --> 1:12:19.294
what Mr. Mullen
was told by Ms. Kelly,

1:12:19.377 --> 1:12:20.628
who claimed it happened
in the hotel,

1:12:20.712 --> 1:12:23.798
where they temporarily reside.

1:12:23.882 --> 1:12:26.051
We have evidence that suggests
that Emma was indeed

1:12:26.134 --> 1:12:28.386
"making something in the garden"

1:12:28.470 --> 1:12:30.638
of a Dr. Margaret O'Toole,

1:12:30.722 --> 1:12:33.475
who is, in fact, allowing
Ms. Kelly to build a house

1:12:33.558 --> 1:12:35.101
-at her property.
-Judge, I-I--

1:12:35.185 --> 1:12:36.811
-Judge, I can, I can explain...
-Please wait, Ms. Kelly.

1:12:36.895 --> 1:12:38.813
Ms. Breen, what relevance
does that have to this hearing?

1:12:38.897 --> 1:12:40.565
The matter is
for another courtroom.

1:12:40.648 --> 1:12:42.525
BREEN: Judge, if this hearing
is about the character

1:12:42.609 --> 1:12:43.985
of these parents and which one

1:12:44.069 --> 1:12:46.112
is a more suitable guardian
to the children,

1:12:46.196 --> 1:12:47.655
it's certainly worth noting

1:12:47.739 --> 1:12:49.699
that Ms. Kelly did not inform
Dublin City Council

1:12:49.783 --> 1:12:52.952
about this build
or her change of circumstances.

1:12:53.036 --> 1:12:55.455
No. Dr. O'Toole got planning.
Uh, it was her property.

1:12:55.538 --> 1:12:58.583
BREEN: And Ms. Kelly lied
on an assessment form.

1:12:58.666 --> 1:13:01.544
When asked in June of this year
if you'd received a loan

1:13:01.628 --> 1:13:04.172
or had other housing options,
you wrote "N/A,"

1:13:04.255 --> 1:13:06.466
"not applicable," did you not?

1:13:06.549 --> 1:13:09.219
I-I-I didn't lie.

1:13:09.302 --> 1:13:11.387
BREEN:
Well, it's on that form, Sandra.

1:13:11.471 --> 1:13:13.556
Are you trying to get two houses
instead of one?

1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:15.266
No. No.

1:13:15.350 --> 1:13:16.851
Judge, is this a fit mother?

1:13:16.935 --> 1:13:19.354
No. You're not doing this!

1:13:19.437 --> 1:13:22.857
You are not doing--
you are not taking my kids!

1:13:22.941 --> 1:13:25.235
JUDGE:
All right, all right.

1:13:25.318 --> 1:13:28.238
20 minutes' break while
I go over this new evidence

1:13:28.321 --> 1:13:30.281
and your client calms herself.

1:13:30.365 --> 1:13:32.200
GRAINNE:
They might take the girls

1:13:32.283 --> 1:13:34.911
because she fudged
some bloody form?

1:13:34.994 --> 1:13:36.412
JO:
Yes. Yes, they might.

1:13:36.496 --> 1:13:39.415
Because when it comes
to legally binding forms,

1:13:39.499 --> 1:13:41.376
you have to tell the truth.

1:13:41.459 --> 1:13:44.671
Truth in the right tone
of voice, though, isn't it?

1:13:44.754 --> 1:13:46.131
Tell the truth?

1:13:46.214 --> 1:13:47.799
Don't tempt me.

1:13:47.882 --> 1:13:50.260
I'll be here all fucking week.

1:13:52.053 --> 1:13:54.097
(breathing heavily)

1:13:57.308 --> 1:13:59.602
Come here to me.

1:14:01.688 --> 1:14:04.149
Of course you were gonna stay
on the housing list.

1:14:04.232 --> 1:14:05.775
Anything could have happened.

1:14:05.859 --> 1:14:07.902
-Yeah, but look what I've done.
-Sandra,

1:14:07.986 --> 1:14:10.071
you're building a home
for your children.

1:14:10.155 --> 1:14:12.240
You're working day and night
to give them

1:14:12.323 --> 1:14:14.367
a childhood
that they've been denied,

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:15.827
and then, every weekend,

1:14:15.910 --> 1:14:17.704
you have to drop them home
to that fucker.

1:14:17.787 --> 1:14:20.290
Do they have any idea
what that takes?

1:14:20.373 --> 1:14:22.375
I can't. I can't lose them.

1:14:22.458 --> 1:14:23.585
-No.
-I can't lose...

1:14:23.668 --> 1:14:25.837
And you won't, you won't.
Come on.

1:14:26.921 --> 1:14:27.922
You won't.

1:14:29.674 --> 1:14:31.676
I know you didn't stop Molly
going to see her father.

1:14:31.759 --> 1:14:35.096
She didn't want to,
and you listened to her.

1:14:35.180 --> 1:14:37.390
I'm so impressed by you, Sandra.

1:14:38.933 --> 1:14:40.852
You know...

1:14:40.935 --> 1:14:43.438
most of us get so sunk
in our own pain,

1:14:43.521 --> 1:14:47.817
we don't notice our children's,
but you did.

1:14:47.901 --> 1:14:49.319
And that makes you
a good mother,

1:14:49.402 --> 1:14:51.362
and they've got to see that.

1:14:53.823 --> 1:14:56.618
You know, Jo's right.

1:14:56.701 --> 1:14:59.495
You go out there
and you tell them the truth.

1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:03.750
All right?

1:15:03.833 --> 1:15:06.336
-(sniffles)
-Oh.

1:15:06.419 --> 1:15:08.504
One more thing.

1:15:10.381 --> 1:15:11.591
Come here.

1:15:15.094 --> 1:15:16.304
(Sandra sniffles)

1:15:21.017 --> 1:15:22.685
There.

1:15:22.769 --> 1:15:24.062
There's Sandra.

1:15:26.898 --> 1:15:28.316
(Sandra sniffles)

1:15:30.026 --> 1:15:33.112
JUDGE: Mr. Mullen, has Emma
recovered from her injury,

1:15:33.196 --> 1:15:34.697
in your opinion?

1:15:34.781 --> 1:15:37.742
Yes, Judge, but I don't want me
kids in an unsafe environment.

1:15:37.825 --> 1:15:39.035
Unsafe?

1:15:39.118 --> 1:15:41.246
-Ms. Kelly.
-Gary, that was a scrape.

1:15:41.329 --> 1:15:43.581
How many times has Emma done
that coming off her scooter?

1:15:43.665 --> 1:15:44.958
JUDGE:
Okay.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:47.418
Let's just for a moment
look at the facts here.

1:15:49.045 --> 1:15:51.881
The report says Molly has missed
eight access visits.

1:15:51.965 --> 1:15:53.216
Mr. Mullen hasn't missed one.

1:15:53.299 --> 1:15:54.759
He's paid child maintenance.

1:15:54.842 --> 1:15:56.594
He's done everything
that was legally required.

1:15:56.678 --> 1:15:58.388
SANDRA:
Because that's what he does.

1:15:58.471 --> 1:16:00.306
He does what's required,
but that's not...

1:16:00.390 --> 1:16:02.433
Fact, Ms. Kelly.
Whereas you have not.

1:16:02.517 --> 1:16:04.435
Why is that?

1:16:07.605 --> 1:16:09.148
Ask better questions.

1:16:09.232 --> 1:16:10.692
I beg your pardon?

1:16:10.775 --> 1:16:13.027
Ask him why he's using
the children as pawns

1:16:13.111 --> 1:16:14.862
in front of us all,

1:16:14.946 --> 1:16:18.574
while we're all wondering why
I didn't fill in a form right?

1:16:19.867 --> 1:16:21.786
(scoffs)

1:16:21.869 --> 1:16:24.122
You want to know
why I didn't let Molly go?

1:16:25.790 --> 1:16:28.376
Because she was hiding
in the wardrobe...

1:16:28.459 --> 1:16:31.504
pissing on herself...

1:16:31.587 --> 1:16:34.632
because she was so scared
of seeing you.

1:16:36.217 --> 1:16:38.594
She saw, Gary.

1:16:39.804 --> 1:16:41.347
She saw you that day.

1:16:43.266 --> 1:16:46.477
She watched you punch my face
and pull my hair

1:16:46.561 --> 1:16:48.062
and wreck my hand.

1:16:48.146 --> 1:16:51.274
And you didn't see her,
but she saw.

1:16:51.357 --> 1:16:55.028
And I can't make her unsee that.

1:16:55.111 --> 1:16:59.032
But, Christ, I'm her mother
and I'll listen.

1:17:02.410 --> 1:17:03.619
I'd do it again.

1:17:05.204 --> 1:17:06.998
I would.

1:17:07.081 --> 1:17:09.167
I'd do it a million times over.

1:17:11.127 --> 1:17:15.089
And making out
that I'm a bad person?

1:17:15.173 --> 1:17:17.258
That I'm a bad mother?

1:17:17.342 --> 1:17:19.844
When you all know
what he did to me?

1:17:19.927 --> 1:17:23.473
You all know
from the Garda reports

1:17:23.556 --> 1:17:24.682
and the medical reports,

1:17:24.766 --> 1:17:26.601
and yet you still bring me
in here

1:17:26.684 --> 1:17:28.478
and you put me through this,

1:17:28.561 --> 1:17:30.480
sit me in the same room
with him,

1:17:30.563 --> 1:17:32.482
ask me questions like,

1:17:32.565 --> 1:17:34.942
"Why didn't you leave him?"

1:17:35.026 --> 1:17:38.821
But you never ask,
"Why didn't he stop?"

1:17:45.328 --> 1:17:46.454
Ms. Kelly, take a seat.

1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:15.233
This type of injury could have
come from a playground,

1:18:15.316 --> 1:18:17.235
a tumble in the street.

1:18:17.318 --> 1:18:19.153
But it didn't, Ms. Kelly.

1:18:19.237 --> 1:18:20.696
It happened in your care.

1:18:20.780 --> 1:18:24.325
Albeit while you were in
the process of building a house,

1:18:24.409 --> 1:18:25.868
to secure
your children's future.

1:18:27.829 --> 1:18:30.415
I understand Molly has witnessed
something she shouldn't,

1:18:30.498 --> 1:18:33.709
but I cannot condone
parental alienation.

1:18:33.793 --> 1:18:36.504
I order that the children be
assessed in the coming months

1:18:36.587 --> 1:18:39.632
to establish their needs,
what they truly want.

1:18:39.715 --> 1:18:43.094
But for now...
the terms of access remain.

1:18:43.177 --> 1:18:46.764
Mr. Mullen,
you will not get custody today.

1:18:46.848 --> 1:18:49.517
(Sandra sighing)

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:51.644
However, Ms. Kelly,

1:18:51.727 --> 1:18:53.187
if you want to build yourself
a house,

1:18:53.271 --> 1:18:55.231
you must take
full responsibility for that.

1:18:55.314 --> 1:18:57.442
You must inform
Dublin City Council

1:18:57.525 --> 1:18:59.902
that you wish to be taken off
the housing list.

1:18:59.986 --> 1:19:01.362
Your right to rent allowance
will cease

1:19:01.446 --> 1:19:03.406
when you and the children move
into this new house.

1:19:03.489 --> 1:19:05.867
-Understood?
-Yes, Judge.

1:19:05.950 --> 1:19:07.660
Very well.

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:08.744
CLERK:
The court is adjourned.

1:19:08.828 --> 1:19:11.414
All rise.

1:19:11.497 --> 1:19:12.457
(indistinct chatter)

1:19:12.540 --> 1:19:15.418
(chuckles)

1:19:15.501 --> 1:19:18.129
I'm keeping me kids.
(laughs)

1:19:18.212 --> 1:19:21.174
-Oh, shit, your hip.
-Oh, bugger the hip.

1:19:21.257 --> 1:19:24.469
I'm so happy for you.

1:19:24.552 --> 1:19:26.762
(both sigh, chuckle)

1:19:33.811 --> 1:19:37.106
Oh. Thanks.

1:19:39.108 --> 1:19:42.320
(Sandra sighs)

1:19:42.403 --> 1:19:43.738
SANDRA:
Guess what, girls.

1:19:43.821 --> 1:19:46.908
Aido said we can move in
in three days.

1:19:46.991 --> 1:19:48.784
-MOLLY: Wow.
-EMMA: Cool.

1:19:48.868 --> 1:19:51.913
-SANDRA: Want to see what's
in your room? -Yeah! -Yeah!

1:19:51.996 --> 1:19:53.831
MOLLY:
Oh, my God.

1:19:53.915 --> 1:19:57.084
EMMA:
Oh, no. Molly.

1:19:57.168 --> 1:19:58.836
Wow.

1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:00.505
This is such a cool bedroom.

1:20:00.588 --> 1:20:02.256
EMMA:
I know, I love it.

1:20:03.674 --> 1:20:06.719
Can you imagine
sleeping here now, Molly?

1:20:06.802 --> 1:20:09.722
(girls continue chatting
indistinctly)

1:20:12.183 --> 1:20:15.102
(birds chirping)

1:20:33.996 --> 1:20:35.498
SANDRA:
Oh, my God.

1:20:35.581 --> 1:20:38.251
-Girls!
-EMMA: Wow.

1:20:38.334 --> 1:20:40.711
-Wait for me.
-EMMA: Molly, come look.

1:20:40.795 --> 1:20:42.672
Did you see the table?

1:20:42.755 --> 1:20:45.132
This, Dariusz made this.
It's lovely, isn't it?

1:20:45.216 --> 1:20:46.342
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:20:46.425 --> 1:20:47.677
(all chuckling)

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:50.888
-All we need now is the chairs.
-Mm-hmm.

1:20:50.972 --> 1:20:52.557
Or we can be
just sitting like this.

1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:53.516
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:20:53.599 --> 1:20:54.600

Congratulations, you ledge!

1:20:58.437 --> 1:20:59.855
-TOMO: Whoo!
-You did the kitchen?

1:20:59.939 --> 1:21:01.190
Uh, that was mainly me.

1:21:01.274 --> 1:21:03.859
Me hole, was it.
Yewande was at it all day.

1:21:03.943 --> 1:21:05.570
-SANDRA: Oh, thanks.
-Here.

1:21:05.653 --> 1:21:08.823
-From all of us.
-Oh, my God.

1:21:08.906 --> 1:21:10.324
Look at the box.

1:21:10.408 --> 1:21:12.368
Oh, look.

1:21:12.451 --> 1:21:14.829
Me own doorknob.

1:21:14.912 --> 1:21:16.205
-Thanks a million!
-(laughter)

1:21:16.289 --> 1:21:18.749
-Come here, will you take
a picture? -Ah, yeah, go on.

1:21:18.833 --> 1:21:20.876
Yewande and everyone,
will you get up on the stairs?

1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:22.962
Oh, yeah. We're allowed
photographs now, are we?

1:21:23.045 --> 1:21:24.380
All right, smart-ass.

1:21:24.463 --> 1:21:26.674
Come on, it's a group photo.
Get in there, yeah.

1:21:26.757 --> 1:21:27.883
-Come here, Emma.
-Yous ready?

1:21:27.967 --> 1:21:29.010
-SANDRA: Everybody in?
-OTHERS: Yeah.

1:21:29.093 --> 1:21:30.219
All right. What do we say?

1:21:30.303 --> 1:21:32.096
Eggs, sausages,
black and white pudding...

Meitheal means where
