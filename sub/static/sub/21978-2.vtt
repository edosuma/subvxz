01:18.794 --> 01:20.235
Oh, great.

01:20.236 --> 01:21.912
I've just been dedaisied.

01:21.913 --> 01:24.694
And you'll be
pushing up daisies

01:24.695 --> 01:27.208
if we don't improve our jungle
fighting techniques.

01:27.209 --> 01:30.627
Shredder could show up
any time, any place.

01:30.628 --> 01:33.376
Man, Leonardo,
you are such a downer.

01:36.495 --> 01:38.270
I believe you were
saying something

01:38.271 --> 01:40.047
about improving
our technique ?

01:40.048 --> 01:42.092
Very funny, Donatello.

01:43.702 --> 01:45.042
It's Shredder !

01:45.043 --> 01:47.321
We're ready for you,
Shred-head.

01:52.016 --> 01:53.758
Ready to say uncle ?

01:53.759 --> 01:56.540
Chill out, dude !

01:56.541 --> 01:58.954
Come on. It's me.

01:58.955 --> 02:00.395
Michelangelo ?

02:00.396 --> 02:02.340
For sure, dudes.

02:02.341 --> 02:04.585
Had you going there
for a while, though, didn't I ?

02:05.592 --> 02:07.268
Where'd you
get the mask ?

02:07.269 --> 02:09.681
Hey, i made it
from an old pizza tray.

02:09.681 --> 02:10.687
Where else ?

02:13.470 --> 02:14.810
What was that ?

02:14.811 --> 02:16.721
It's some kind
of spaceship.

02:16.722 --> 02:19.570
Major notion !

02:19.571 --> 02:21.079
It's gonna crash !

02:23.259 --> 02:24.598
Let's go, turtles !

02:28.890 --> 02:31.470
We've got
to get him up fast !

02:33.751 --> 02:35.661
Up you go, guy.

02:42.433 --> 02:43.740
He's still alive.

02:43.741 --> 02:45.617
Let's get him
to shore quick !

02:45.618 --> 02:49.170
Man, this is one
freaky-looking alien.

02:49.171 --> 02:51.081
He probably thinks
you're pretty weird, too.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.115
What have those meddlesome
turtles stumbled upon now ?

02:58.893 --> 03:00.468
Quick !
Boil some water.

03:00.469 --> 03:02.680
We're not delivering
a baby, dimbo.

03:02.681 --> 03:04.725
I heard it in a movie.

03:07.978 --> 03:11.965
The eye of Zarnov...

03:11.966 --> 03:14.212
You must find
the 3 fragments

03:14.213 --> 03:16.826
of the eye of Zarnov.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.603
Fragments ?

03:18.604 --> 03:23.531
3 pieces of my ship
fell to the earth.

03:23.532 --> 03:25.811
When they are joined,

03:25.812 --> 03:31.274
the possessor will have
power undreamed of...

03:31.275 --> 03:33.990
In your world.

03:33.991 --> 03:36.538
Undreamed of power ?

03:36.539 --> 03:38.549
I like the sound of that.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.929
But how can
we find these fragments ?

03:40.930 --> 03:42.236
They could be anywhere.

03:43.445 --> 03:45.924
With this crystal converger...

03:46.931 --> 03:49.779
You can track
the energy released

03:49.780 --> 03:52.260
by each fragment.

03:52.261 --> 03:55.076
Hurry...

03:55.077 --> 03:58.998
Before they fall
into evil hands.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.606
Once assembled,

04:00.607 --> 04:03.523
their power
cannot be stopped.

04:05.971 --> 04:09.792
Farewell, earthlings.

04:11.905 --> 04:15.759
Oh, whoa, man.
Vaporized.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.535
He...
He's gone.

04:17.536 --> 04:19.949
Just the way
those turtles will be

04:19.950 --> 04:22.731
once i locate
those fragments.

04:24.510 --> 04:26.821
Turn left.
Now right.

04:26.822 --> 04:28.531
Make up your mind, will you ?

04:28.532 --> 04:29.537
I can't help it.

04:29.538 --> 04:31.749
This crystal tracker
is very sensitive.

04:31.750 --> 04:35.168
See if that gizmo's got
a setting for food, bud.

04:35.169 --> 04:37.381
I could use a pizza break.

04:37.382 --> 04:38.957
Will you cool it
with the pizzas ?

04:38.958 --> 04:40.767
We're after something big.

04:40.768 --> 04:42.677
Well, all right, then.

04:42.678 --> 04:45.594
Just make it
a family-sized pizza.

04:45.595 --> 04:47.103
The fools !

04:47.104 --> 04:49.616
They're leading me
to the fragments.

04:49.617 --> 04:50.622
Baxter !

04:50.623 --> 04:53.304
Connect me with Krang
in Dimension X

04:53.305 --> 04:54.478
Immediately !

04:54.479 --> 04:58.433
But my cone is melting
in the sun.

04:58.434 --> 05:01.014
Silence, toad !
Do as i say

05:01.015 --> 05:02.221
and now !

05:02.222 --> 05:03.796
As you wish, master.

05:14.122 --> 05:17.943
Yes, Shredder ?
What is it now ?

05:17.944 --> 05:19.620
Good news, Krang.

05:19.621 --> 05:21.161
I will soon have the weapon

05:21.162 --> 05:23.307
with which to destroy
the turtles.

05:23.308 --> 05:25.150
You have promised
this before

05:25.151 --> 05:26.894
and

05:26.895 --> 05:29.877
but this time,
I shall be successful.

05:29.878 --> 05:32.090
If only i could have
my foot soldiers.

05:32.091 --> 05:33.732
The answer is no,

05:33.733 --> 05:36.548
not until you bring
the turtles to me

05:36.549 --> 05:37.620
on a plate.

05:37.621 --> 05:42.214
Until then, stop wasting
my precious time !

05:43.220 --> 05:46.370
Oh, blast that bodiless brain !

05:47.578 --> 05:50.091
Nice, Baxter.
Nice.

05:51.534 --> 05:54.014
The converger is telling us
to turn here, Leonardo.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.148
A garbage truck ?

06:00.149 --> 06:01.723
There it is !

06:03.668 --> 06:05.344
And there it goes.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.283
Ok, turtles, it's up to us.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.295
Are you suggesting
that we go climbing

06:14.296 --> 06:15.971
through that garbage ?

06:15.972 --> 06:18.686
Hey, it's a dirty job,
but someone's got to do it.

06:18.687 --> 06:20.429
True, but how come
that someone's

06:20.430 --> 06:22.373
always got to be us ?

06:26.397 --> 06:27.904
Does that answer
your question ?

06:27.905 --> 06:29.380
Ok, guys !

06:29.381 --> 06:33.100
Last one in is
a rotten tomato !

06:35.113 --> 06:36.721
Innocent fools.

06:36.722 --> 06:39.034
As usual, they're in
over their heads.

06:40.141 --> 06:42.319
Look, guys.
Jackpot !

06:42.320 --> 06:43.828
If you don't mind,

06:43.829 --> 06:45.336
I'll take that !

06:45.337 --> 06:46.577
Shredder !

06:48.690 --> 06:50.532
Hey, give that back !

06:50.533 --> 06:52.275
Come and get it, mutants.

06:52.276 --> 06:54.454
With pleasure, tin face.

06:58.075 --> 07:00.253
One down, three to go.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.896
Say adios, dipstick.

07:01.897 --> 07:04.176
You're about to get dusted.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.964
What ?!

07:07.965 --> 07:09.976
I'd say the tables were turned.

07:09.977 --> 07:11.484
My turn, bozo.

07:11.485 --> 07:12.724
A simple challenge.

07:15.071 --> 07:16.412
Saved by the shell.

07:16.413 --> 07:19.027
See if you can handle me,
Shredder.

07:19.028 --> 07:22.579
Mere child's play.
Watch.

07:26.336 --> 07:29.284
Net result,
4 trapped turtles.

07:29.285 --> 07:31.161
Oh, i made a funny.

07:31.162 --> 07:33.944
Now to cut you
down to size.

07:36.526 --> 07:39.710
So much for
the free ninja lesson.

07:39.711 --> 07:43.229
I have won this fragment
in clean combat.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.972
You mean dirty combat ?

07:47.086 --> 07:49.364
What's happening ?

07:49.365 --> 07:51.208
I don't know,

07:51.209 --> 07:53.722
but it's, like,
Mondo beyond-o !

07:53.723 --> 07:57.007
Well, an unexpected power.

07:57.008 --> 07:58.314
It's Shredder !

07:58.315 --> 07:59.622
He's getting bigger !

07:59.623 --> 08:00.729
Wrong, Leonardo.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.337
We're getting
smaller !

08:02.338 --> 08:04.818
That must be the power
of the fragment.

08:04.819 --> 08:06.997
It makes things shrink.

08:06.998 --> 08:08.472
Ah, great.

08:08.473 --> 08:11.120
At last i have
you meddlesome turtles

08:11.121 --> 08:14.104
right in the palm
of my hand.

08:18.228 --> 08:20.506
Now to crush
you meddlesome turtles

08:20.507 --> 08:22.719
One by one !

08:22.720 --> 08:25.066
Guess again,
frying pan face.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.641
Blast you !

08:27.916 --> 08:29.994
Stand still,
you little shrinkers.

08:34.788 --> 08:36.732
What do we do now,
Leonardo ?

08:36.732 --> 08:39.481
This thing is getting heavy.

08:39.482 --> 08:43.000
I say it's time
to haul shell.

08:43.001 --> 08:45.917
Come back and fight
like men, you mutants !

08:48.867 --> 08:50.140
You guys go on.

08:50.141 --> 08:52.051
I can't run
any farther.

08:52.052 --> 08:55.203
Never !
We'll make our stand here !

08:55.204 --> 08:56.744
Kind of like custer did ?

08:56.745 --> 09:00.532
Who needs foot soldiers
when a single foot

09:00.533 --> 09:01.940
will take care of you insects ?

09:03.551 --> 09:07.472
Here comes the cavalry !

09:08.646 --> 09:10.723
Look out !

09:11.897 --> 09:13.674
No. It can't be.

09:13.675 --> 09:14.579
They've escaped.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.556
But i have
the first fragment

09:16.557 --> 09:17.998
of the eye of Zarnov,

09:17.999 --> 09:22.523
and soon its limitless power
shall be mine !

09:28.726 --> 09:32.077
We've gotta make it home
before we get even smaller.

09:32.078 --> 09:33.888
And quick.
We're shrinking faster

09:33.889 --> 09:35.262
Than a pair
of cheap underwear.

09:35.263 --> 09:37.843
Ok, the coast
is clear.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.765
Hey, watch it,
Bigfoot !

09:44.380 --> 09:46.760
We made it.

09:49.744 --> 09:51.789
Oh, thanks a lot, fella !

09:51.790 --> 09:53.699
Cheer up, turtles.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.777
At least things
can't get any worse.

09:55.778 --> 09:58.727
Oh, no ?
Scope that out !

09:58.728 --> 10:00.572
A watering truck !

10:00.573 --> 10:02.750
Head for
the high ground !

10:02.751 --> 10:04.527
I've got news for you.

10:04.528 --> 10:06.606
The high ground
is too high.

10:09.556 --> 10:11.030
Remember,

10:11.031 --> 10:13.242
we're at home
under the water.

10:13.243 --> 10:14.885
Just keep
telling me that !

10:21.825 --> 10:23.232
There's gotta be
an easier way

10:23.233 --> 10:24.473
to get home than this.

10:26.619 --> 10:29.802
It would seem we have
quite a large problem.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.819
<i>Please, sensei,
must you use the word "large" ?</i>

10:32.820 --> 10:35.937
And one that requires
immediate action.

10:35.938 --> 10:39.691
April, this is Splinter.
Please respond.

10:39.692 --> 10:44.887
Remember, we at channel 6 news
have to be decisive, daring,

10:44.889 --> 10:47.570
Able to make
split-second decisions.

10:47.571 --> 10:49.414
April, are you there ?

10:49.415 --> 10:50.587
Did you say something ?

10:50.588 --> 10:51.927
Who ? Me ?

10:51.928 --> 10:53.268
April...

10:53.269 --> 10:54.776
Yes, you.
April.

10:54.777 --> 10:56.621
You are needed most urgently.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.297
It's an emergency.

10:58.298 --> 11:00.140
I've got to go,
mr. Thompson.

11:00.141 --> 11:01.649
It's a hot story.

11:01.650 --> 11:03.192
Go ? Go where ?

11:03.193 --> 11:05.035
We're right in the middle
of a meeting.

11:05.036 --> 11:06.678
You said yourself
we've got to make

11:06.679 --> 11:08.220
split-second decisions.

11:08.221 --> 11:09.359
Ciao !

11:09.360 --> 11:11.672
But that was only a speech !

11:12.746 --> 11:15.226
Unlimited power ?
Rubbish.

11:15.227 --> 11:18.578
You have given me nothing
but empty promises.

11:18.579 --> 11:20.891
But, Krang, I have destroyed
the turtles

11:20.892 --> 11:22.265
as you ordered.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.377
Lies ! Lies ! Lies !

11:24.378 --> 11:25.651
Where is your proof ?

11:27.395 --> 11:28.768
Like many a turtle
before them,

11:28.769 --> 11:31.249
they have been
flushed down the sewers.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.395
Talk is cheap.

11:33.396 --> 11:36.948
What i want is
indisputable evidence.

11:36.949 --> 11:39.697
Is my word not good enough ?

11:39.698 --> 11:43.888
Precisely.
Your word is not good enough.

11:43.889 --> 11:44.893
But...

11:46.168 --> 11:48.581
If proof is what
that maniac medulla wants,

11:48.582 --> 11:50.893
then proof he shall have !

11:50.894 --> 11:53.642
Thank you, April,
for answering my call.

11:53.643 --> 11:54.883
We must find Shredder

11:54.884 --> 11:56.559
and that alien fragment

11:56.560 --> 11:59.106
before he uses it
to do further damage.

11:59.107 --> 12:00.649
Those poor turtles.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.693
Less than 6 inches high.

12:02.694 --> 12:04.168
We interrupt this commercial

12:04.169 --> 12:06.146
to bring you
a special bulletin.

12:06.147 --> 12:07.721
Interrupt a commercial ?

12:07.723 --> 12:09.566
It must be big news !

12:09.567 --> 12:13.018
The empire state building
is actually shrinking.

12:16.439 --> 12:18.081
Shredder !

12:18.082 --> 12:19.287
Precisely.

12:19.288 --> 12:22.573
Now he's turned that fragment
on innocent people.

12:22.574 --> 12:23.947
Hang on, Splinter.

12:23.948 --> 12:25.991
Next stop,
the Empire State Building.

12:25.992 --> 12:29.043
It's being reported
that this is just one

12:29.044 --> 12:31.624
of many midtown buildings
that have been shrunk.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.372
Come on, mister !
Hurry !

12:34.373 --> 12:36.384
You're the last one left !

12:41.010 --> 12:44.865
Ah, the alien crystal
has done its work beautifully.

12:44.866 --> 12:47.211
Oh, yes, master.
Magnificently.

12:47.212 --> 12:50.128
And this will be
the crown jewel

12:50.129 --> 12:51.402
in my collection.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.385
Now Krang will have
to send me my foot warriors.

12:55.693 --> 12:56.933
It's hopeless.

12:56.934 --> 12:58.073
By the time we get there,

12:58.074 --> 12:59.447
Shredder
will be gone.

12:59.448 --> 13:02.163
We must retrieve
the alien crystal,

13:02.164 --> 13:05.145
or i dread to think
what may befall the city.

13:07.997 --> 13:10.677
Well, one good thing
about being tiny...

13:10.678 --> 13:13.862
Yeah, one slice of pizza
is enough for all of us.

13:13.863 --> 13:17.047
Like, speak
for yourself, dude.

13:17.048 --> 13:18.890
Oh, no !
Look !

13:18.891 --> 13:22.645
It's a tidal wave !

13:22.646 --> 13:23.718
Why are we running ?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.863
It's just your average
sewer trickle.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.606
Sure, but we're no longer

13:27.607 --> 13:29.684
your average-size
mutant turtles.

13:35.853 --> 13:37.998
Quick, turtles.
Climb aboard !

13:37.999 --> 13:41.216
I didn't know they made bars
of soap this big.

13:41.217 --> 13:44.702
It must be the large
family size, huh ?

13:44.703 --> 13:47.217
Speaking of things
that are large...

13:47.218 --> 13:49.060
A sewer snake !

13:49.062 --> 13:51.910
What a way to go.

13:51.911 --> 13:53.753
We're not swallowed yet.

14:05.421 --> 14:07.732
Let's do lunch
again sometime.

14:07.733 --> 14:09.710
Oh, nice going,
Leonardo.

14:09.711 --> 14:11.855
Now we're traveling
economy class.

14:14.538 --> 14:16.616
Shredder !

14:16.617 --> 14:18.393
Shredder, this had
better be good.

14:18.394 --> 14:19.767
I'm much too busy

14:19.768 --> 14:22.918
for your time-wasting
conversations.

14:22.919 --> 14:24.628
The talking is over.

14:24.629 --> 14:26.605
This time,
I will show you deeds.

14:27.612 --> 14:29.790
Behold !

14:29.791 --> 14:32.338
Is this some sort of joke ?

14:32.339 --> 14:35.389
I asked for petrified turtles,

14:35.390 --> 14:39.545
and bring me toy buildings !

14:39.546 --> 14:42.595
And i want them now !

14:42.596 --> 14:46.116
Blast
that grotesque ganglion !

14:46.117 --> 14:47.791
Might i suggest this ?

14:47.792 --> 14:50.306
What in blazes
is that monstrosity ?

14:50.307 --> 14:51.681
An invention of mine.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.262
A heat-seeking
turtle scope.

14:54.263 --> 14:56.675
It'll locate them
no matter how tiny
they are.

14:56.676 --> 14:58.586
Oh, excellent.

14:58.587 --> 15:02.307
Now go, and don't come back
without those mini-amphibians.

15:02.308 --> 15:03.882
Never fear, master.

15:03.883 --> 15:05.625
They're as good
as captured.

15:07.035 --> 15:09.447
Well, it looks like we're not
the only ones shrinking.

15:09.448 --> 15:10.754
The soap is, too.

15:10.755 --> 15:11.962
Hold it, guys.

15:11.963 --> 15:13.973
We've got more
serious problems.

15:13.974 --> 15:16.118
Oh, yeah ?
Like what ?

15:16.119 --> 15:18.431
Like that.
A storm drain !

15:18.432 --> 15:20.543
And we're headed
right for it !

15:20.544 --> 15:24.968
Oh, what a bummer.
No soap, no hope.

15:24.969 --> 15:27.918
Hang on.
We're going over !

15:44.815 --> 15:46.121
Buds !

15:46.122 --> 15:48.937
That was definitely
a radical ride.

15:50.982 --> 15:53.194
Now all we've got
to worry about

15:53.195 --> 15:54.535
is getting to shore.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.116
We've got bigger problems
than that, Leonardo.

15:57.117 --> 15:59.563
You're always
looking for trouble.

15:59.564 --> 16:00.837
Oh, yeah ?

16:00.838 --> 16:02.748
Well, this time,
the trouble's looking for us.

16:06.235 --> 16:08.346
It's moby dick's big brother !

16:08.347 --> 16:10.189
I promise, dude,

16:10.190 --> 16:13.475
I'll never eat another
anchovy pizza again.

16:13.476 --> 16:15.989
I got news for you.
You may never eat

16:15.990 --> 16:17.397
another pizza period !

16:19.343 --> 16:21.856
What's going on ?

16:21.857 --> 16:24.035
Well, what do
we have here ?

16:24.036 --> 16:26.113
Why, it's a rare species

16:26.114 --> 16:28.694
of soon-to-be
extinct turtles.

16:29.902 --> 16:32.851
Something tells me
we were better off

16:32.852 --> 16:34.326
with the fish.

16:34.327 --> 16:38.450
This is most strange.

16:38.451 --> 16:39.690
What is it, Splinter ?

16:39.691 --> 16:41.768
I left the turtles at home.

16:41.769 --> 16:44.382
Yet I sense
they are close by.

16:44.383 --> 16:48.339
<i>The connection between sensei
and student is very strong.</i>

16:48.340 --> 16:49.947
I hope you're wrong.

16:49.948 --> 16:52.126
In their present condition,
they wouldn't last long

16:52.127 --> 16:53.702
in a neighborhood
like this.

16:53.703 --> 16:56.585
Yes, they are
now quite close.

16:56.586 --> 16:59.066
My bond with the turtles
has not diminished,

16:59.067 --> 17:01.245
even if they have.

17:01.246 --> 17:02.652
Please, turn here.

17:02.653 --> 17:05.233
There !
That is !

17:05.234 --> 17:06.675
Well, Krang,

17:06.675 --> 17:09.960
what have you
to say now ?

17:09.961 --> 17:15.223
Perhaps i have underestimated
your evil abilities after all.

17:15.224 --> 17:18.073
My thoughts exactly.

17:18.074 --> 17:21.994
What have you to say now,
mini-mutants ?

17:21.996 --> 17:24.509
You'll never get away
with this, Krang !

17:25.784 --> 17:29.035
Well, you got to admit
it sounded good.

17:31.148 --> 17:34.633
And now, Krang,
for your viewing pleasure,

17:34.634 --> 17:37.986
you shall witness
the final agonizing moments

17:37.987 --> 17:40.198
of the turtles' demise.

17:40.199 --> 17:44.153
Splendid !
Let the show begin.

17:44.154 --> 17:45.494
If I had hands,

17:45.495 --> 17:48.813
they'd be sweating
in anticipation.

17:48.814 --> 17:51.662
Can't we discuss this
like human beings ?

17:51.663 --> 17:52.936
Nice try, Donatello.

17:52.937 --> 17:54.847
Sayonara, turtles.

18:00.178 --> 18:01.216
Splinter !

18:02.860 --> 18:04.334
Yes, Shredder.

18:04.335 --> 18:08.490
<i>Your old sensei has returned
to teach you a new lesson.</i>

18:08.491 --> 18:10.905
Feeble rodent.

18:10.906 --> 18:12.480
I will do
the teaching.

18:16.436 --> 18:19.452
Infernal
technical difficulties !

18:19.453 --> 18:23.073
And just when the show
was getting interesting.

18:25.085 --> 18:28.001
Not bad for a rusty,
old has-been.

18:28.002 --> 18:29.945
One with a face
made of metal

18:29.946 --> 18:32.091
should not use
the word "rusty."

18:38.025 --> 18:40.203
Hey, let me out of here !

18:41.209 --> 18:44.024
Try again, Shredder.

18:44.025 --> 18:46.773
I intend to !

18:46.774 --> 18:50.896
Oh, what a ride.
My brain feels like tofu.

18:53.949 --> 18:55.824
April, over here.

18:55.825 --> 18:58.607
We're behind
this big hunk of junk.

18:58.608 --> 19:01.020
Turtles, is that you ?

19:01.021 --> 19:03.032
Yeah, what
there is of us.

19:03.033 --> 19:05.479
I can't believe it.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.356
You're so tiny.

19:07.357 --> 19:09.871
Look, April, this is no time
for small talk.

19:09.872 --> 19:11.915
Quick !
Aim that crystal at us.

19:11.916 --> 19:14.195
A second jolt
might reverse the effect.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.905
You mean
we might get bigger ?

19:15.906 --> 19:19.055
Well, we can't get
much smaller, Einstein.

19:19.056 --> 19:20.464
It's worth a try.

19:23.247 --> 19:26.665
Advantage Shredder.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.347
It's useless to struggle

19:29.348 --> 19:32.229
against the Shredder
grip of steel.

19:32.230 --> 19:34.241
Quick, April,
turn on the beam !

19:34.242 --> 19:36.085
I'm not sure how.

19:36.086 --> 19:37.292
Neither are we.

19:37.293 --> 19:39.337
It just sort of happened.

19:39.338 --> 19:40.979
Something's happening,

19:40.980 --> 19:42.421
but i don't know what !

19:46.445 --> 19:47.885
Whoa, man.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.734
Yeah, it feels like an intergalactic
tanning booth.

19:50.735 --> 19:53.315
It's working.
We're starting to grow.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.875
Smothered by
a cheese-wrapping machine.

19:57.876 --> 20:00.556
A fitting end for a rat.

20:07.429 --> 20:08.903
What ?

20:08.904 --> 20:10.111
It stopped !

20:10.112 --> 20:12.356
While I have just started.

20:17.352 --> 20:19.563
The crystal !

20:19.564 --> 20:21.810
You may have won
this time, Splinter,

20:21.811 --> 20:23.922
But i still have this !

20:23.923 --> 20:25.765
Quickly, master !
This way !

20:25.766 --> 20:28.481
Till the next time, turtles.
<i>Au revoir !</i>

20:29.488 --> 20:31.296
He's getting away
with the crystal.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.006
We must stop him.

20:33.007 --> 20:36.861
It is useless to try.
He is gone.

20:36.862 --> 20:39.040
I feel we failed you,
master.

20:39.041 --> 20:42.426
It is all part
of the learning process,
Leonardo.

20:42.427 --> 20:46.080
Even our mistakes
can serve as teachers.

20:46.081 --> 20:48.863
And just as mysteriously
as it started,

20:48.864 --> 20:51.209
this entire
shrinking business stopped.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.355
Hopefully one day
the true story

20:53.356 --> 20:56.136
behind this incredible event
can be revealed.

20:56.137 --> 20:58.148
Yeah.
The same day we turtles

20:58.149 --> 21:00.260
can walk around the city
like regular people.

21:00.261 --> 21:01.869
Speaking of things
shrinking,

21:01.870 --> 21:02.942
so is my stomach.

21:02.943 --> 21:04.182
Where the heck
is Michelangelo

21:04.183 --> 21:05.322
With those pizzas ?

21:05.323 --> 21:06.394
Yeah !

21:06.395 --> 21:07.869
He sure is taking
his sweet time.

21:07.870 --> 21:10.283
All right, dudes,

21:10.284 --> 21:12.831
it's scarfing time !

21:12.832 --> 21:15.580
All right !
I'll do the slicing.

21:15.581 --> 21:18.329
Hey, just scope out
these babies.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.485
Babies ?

21:22.486 --> 21:24.363
These things haven't
even been born yet.

21:24.364 --> 21:26.307
Is this some kind
of a sick joke ?

21:26.308 --> 21:29.559
Well, ask Splinter.
It was his idea.

21:30.834 --> 21:34.721
I had them specially made
for my small students

21:34.722 --> 21:36.699
To remind them
they still have

21:36.700 --> 21:38.778
a long way to grow.
