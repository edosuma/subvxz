[narrator] <i>Trapped.</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:20.270
<i>On an unsanctioned mission</i>
<i>to rescue ARC trooper Echo,</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:24.774
<i>General Skywalker, Captain Rex,</i>
<i>and the Bad Batch travel to Skako Minor,</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:31.489

00:31.573 --> 00:35.201
<i>only to find themselves</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:48.423
Hey! [groans]

00:50.133 --> 00:53.386
Hunter, hold them off.
I'll check on Rex and Echo.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.894
Situation's almost under control
out there.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.645
How's it going in here?

01:02.729 --> 01:05.774
I'm still trying to decrypt
Echo's cerebral interface.

01:05.857 --> 01:09.361
Until I do, we cannot disconnect him
from this computer system.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.695
How is he, Rex?

01:10.779 --> 01:12.364
He's too weak to walk.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.825
Very disoriented.
Doesn't even remember how he got here.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.578
He remembers being at the Citadel,
but that's about it.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.413
Any word on the extraction squad?

01:20.497 --> 01:23.249
We called it in, but no word back.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.129
Well, that's no surprise.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.632
We knew when we got into this
we'd be on our own.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.930
[Hunter] It's gonna get more difficult
to get out of here.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.265
There are several squads of droids
closing in.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.508
[Crosshair]
Enemy approaching. Droids-- lots of 'em.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.218
How long can you hold them off?

02:15.301 --> 02:16.636
How long do you need?

02:17.053 --> 02:18.847
Tech, how much longer?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.807
Not yet. I need more time.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.609
[Droid] We have them
completely surrounded, sir.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.028
Good.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.280
Send in the Decimator.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.218
I've got it.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.720
We can unplug him now.

03:08.021 --> 03:08.897
[grunts]

03:11.274 --> 03:13.068
[grunting]

03:13.151 --> 03:15.070
-Rex?
-What is it?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.616
I got a big headache.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.203
Better to feel something than nothing,
old buddy.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.498
It's a touching reunion, guys,
but we need to get out of here now.

03:27.874 --> 03:33.171
There's an exhaust vent that leads
to the cooling systems right there.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.263
They've breached the front door.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.265
It won't be long
before they're through the second.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.645
That should get it open.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.905
Great. Now how do we get up there?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.116
I can help with that.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.368
Wait, what?

04:03.451 --> 04:05.954
Wrecker, what are you doing?

04:07.455 --> 04:09.749
A heads-up would've been nice!

04:09.833 --> 04:11.584
The door's nearly breached, sir.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.546
Whoa!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.348
It's okay, Wrecker. I've got this.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.481
What are you doing?

04:33.565 --> 04:36.651
I'm putting an end
to Tambor's little science experiment.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.281
Are you done? Time's up.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.827
Whoa! Whoa! Oh, no!

04:46.494 --> 04:47.579
What is that thing?

04:48.246 --> 04:49.581
I don't like it! I don't like it!

04:50.457 --> 04:52.292
It's trying to get me! Whoa!

05:03.178 --> 05:05.847
[Wat] What happened? Why did it shut off?

05:06.431 --> 05:09.809
[Droid]
No organic targets were detected, sir.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.395
The room appears to be empty.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.315
Oh, no.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.442
[beeping]

05:24.074 --> 05:25.450
Orders, sir?

05:34.376 --> 05:37.671
They took it-- Techno Union property!

05:38.380 --> 05:41.174
They've ruined years of research.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.802
Find them!

05:45.720 --> 05:49.641
[Tech] Huh. This ventilation corridor
acts as a cooling system

05:49.724 --> 05:51.768
for all the computers in the facility.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.895
How did you know it was up here, Echo?

05:53.978 --> 05:56.147
Well, they got access to my memory,

05:56.231 --> 06:00.318
and I got access
to the Techno Union database.

06:00.402 --> 06:04.531
All their plans, inventory,
building schematics-- everything.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.450
You mean you can find us
a safe way out of here?

06:07.992 --> 06:09.828
Well, there is a way,

06:09.911 --> 06:11.913
[coughs] but you're not gonna like it.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.266
I don't know about this.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.943
I'm telling you, there's a landing pad
on that other building.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.320
So you think
there's a ship there we can steal?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.906
Well, I hope there's a ship we can steal.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.701
Let's hope this trip isn't for nothing.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.675
Oh, boy. I can't even look.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.927
Just keep walking, Tech.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.014
That's fine, but if you fall,
don't take me with you.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.683
Uh-oh. I looked. Ahh!

07:13.767 --> 07:16.353
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Not gonna panic.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.605
Hang on, Wrecker. We're almost there.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.358
Gonna be okay. Breathe.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.613
Turn around! Go back!

07:38.541 --> 07:40.502
Whoa. Wh-Whoa!

07:40.585 --> 07:42.629
Oh, boy. Gotcha!

07:44.464 --> 07:46.424
Anybody got a brilliant idea?

07:46.508 --> 07:48.009
I do have a brilliant idea.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.302
I'm hanging here!

07:49.386 --> 07:52.847
When the locals attacked us,
I recorded the creatures' distress call.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.475
He records everything. It's a hobby.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.978
Which allows us to call
those flying creatures to us.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.940
[high-pitched noise]

08:03.233 --> 08:05.235
[Wrecker] Ow! Enough with the sound!

08:05.610 --> 08:06.695
Take that!

08:07.654 --> 08:09.698
There is our ride out of here!

08:15.537 --> 08:17.414
Now, how do we get on them?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.332
How else? We jump!

08:22.877 --> 08:24.504
All right, I'll go first.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.389
I don't wanna do this, but here I go!

08:37.058 --> 08:38.393
[Tech] See you later!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.904
Uh, that wasn't part of the plan.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.823
Those things can fly!

09:04.836 --> 09:06.963
We have to shake those droids!

09:07.047 --> 09:08.590
How do I steer this thing?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.601
How you holding up, Echo?

09:19.684 --> 09:22.187
Never better, sir! [chuckles]

09:37.160 --> 09:38.912
[speaking alien language]

09:41.623 --> 09:44.209
Their leader is impressed
we tamed the Keeradaks,

09:44.292 --> 09:46.586
but he wants to know why we returned here.

09:46.670 --> 09:51.591
Tell him we had no choice. Tell him...
that we wore out our welcome in Purkoll.

09:52.050 --> 09:57.222
[speaking alien language]

10:09.693 --> 10:10.985
Not good.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.405
If I know Tambor, he'll come after us,

10:13.488 --> 10:16.157
us and the Poletecs,
with everything he's got.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.619
[speaking alien language]

10:20.370 --> 10:21.621
What's he saying, Tech?

10:21.705 --> 10:24.457
He says that we have broken our word.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.168
We have brought the war to his village.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.629
You're right. Tell him he's right, Tech.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.425
Tell him we didn't plan
to drag his people into war.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.261
But look what the Separatists did
to one of our people!

10:40.890 --> 10:43.643
They took away his freedom, his humanity.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.354
They tried to turn him into a machine.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.982
[speaking alien language]

10:54.404 --> 10:56.990
The Techno Union claims it's neutral,

10:57.073 --> 10:59.075
but they have chosen sides.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.953
Now your people have to choose.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.705
Couldn't have said it better, Rex.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.624
Ugh! Let's hope it works,

11:07.125 --> 11:09.127
because I see forces coming--

11:09.669 --> 11:11.755
more than we can handle alone.

11:12.505 --> 11:17.010
[speaking alien language]

11:22.891 --> 11:26.186
-Report.
-The clones are hiding among the natives.

11:26.561 --> 11:30.732
Take the reinforcements
and bring back my experiment.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.093
[alien noises]

12:14.776 --> 12:17.028
[grunting]

14:34.624 --> 14:36.543
Rex, we've gotta take out these walkers.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.336
I'll take one. You take the other.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.089
Don't worry, General.
The boys and I can handle it.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.924
Hunter, Wrecker, you're with me.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.568
Still showing off, huh, General?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.111
You know me, Echo.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.505
That seemed to work.
But how do we get up there?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.758
No, no. Not again!

15:24.841 --> 15:26.509
[yells]

15:42.525 --> 15:44.486
[alien machine screeches]

16:21.231 --> 16:23.274
[speaking alien language, cheering]

16:24.651 --> 16:26.820
It's hard to compete with a Jedi.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.076
Sir, the attack force has failed.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.996
Aw, the loss of the clone
is a devastating blow

16:37.080 --> 16:40.083
to the Techno Union's profit margin.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.586
Should we inform the Separatists
of our loss?

16:44.004 --> 16:45.922
All in good time.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.634
We must find a way
to recoup on our investment.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.225
Thank you for helping us in our fight.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.562
[speaking alien language]

17:00.645 --> 17:04.024
[speaking alien language]

17:04.107 --> 17:07.861
He said the Jedi will always have an ally
here on Skako Minor.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.284
Rex.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.870
Thanks for coming after me.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.122
That's what brothers do.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.541
I'm just sorry it took so long.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.085
Hopefully,
it's gonna be just like old times.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.303
Yeah.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.096
Just like old times.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.150
[theme music playing]
