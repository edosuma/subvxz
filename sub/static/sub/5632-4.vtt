WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:07.806
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.908
What is it? You see a deer?
No.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.610
I forgot to DVR
<i>Fashion Runway</i> tonight.

00:11.645 --> 00:15.280
Brad, just focus
on your landmarks.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.482
We'll be back home
before your show.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.050
Oh, thank God,

00:19.086 --> 00:21.086
'cause Jasmine's two-tone
sundress last week

00:21.121 --> 00:23.054
was so fierce.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.222
I can't wait to see
what she does next.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.590
You know,
other kids your age

00:25.626 --> 00:26.825
aren't into that kind of stuff.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.093
What are they into?

00:28.128 --> 00:29.461
Like, fishing,

00:29.496 --> 00:31.196
or video games.
I mean, I'd be okay

00:31.231 --> 00:33.432
if you were into books
and stuff, instead.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.666
Oh! I read the Diane
Von Furstenberg biography.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.568
I don't know
who that is.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.003
And you're growing
up real fast,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.371
and if you want to
be a man someday,

00:39.406 --> 00:41.473
you're gonna have to act
like one.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.569 --> 01:10.101
You okay, Dad?

01:23.050 --> 01:25.083
So you really like it?

01:25.118 --> 01:26.284
The best thing
you've ever written.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.953
Really?
Because...

01:27.988 --> 01:29.521
all of my books
are quite excellent.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.523
Yeah, but this one,
this is a page-turner.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.658
Plus, the cliffhanger
at the end?

01:33.694 --> 01:34.993
Bravo.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.228
Cliffhanger?

01:36.263 --> 01:37.963
What do you mean?
Well, you know,

01:37.998 --> 01:38.997
with Agent Andy all shot up.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.298
I can't wait to find out

01:40.334 --> 01:41.833
how you're gonna bring him back.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.068
Agent Andy was shot

01:43.103 --> 01:44.603
directly through
the sternum with a .45.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.105
Yeah, I know.
He's a tough guy.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.307
Booth, he's dead.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.878
You can't kill Agent Andy.

01:52.913 --> 01:53.845
Okay?

01:53.881 --> 01:55.680
Agent Andy cannot die.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.282
You wrote him based on me.

01:57.317 --> 01:58.950
He <i> was</i> based on you.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.418
Exsanguination is the
official cause of death,

02:00.454 --> 02:01.987
although some
coroners will say

02:02.022 --> 02:03.889
it's cessation of
brain functions.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.323
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.725
You can't kill Agent Andy.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.193
That is my character,
who is based on me

02:08.228 --> 02:09.461
and you can't just kill him.

02:09.496 --> 02:10.996
Oh, a body was found

02:11.031 --> 02:12.564
in the Blue Ridge
Mountains.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.865
But this whole Agent Andy thing
isn't over yet.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.166
No, Booth,

02:15.202 --> 02:17.669
death is very final.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.539
What?

02:21.608 --> 02:24.009
Come on, Booth. It's not you.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.979
Okay, are you coming or not?

02:48.368 --> 02:49.734
Bones, look,
all I'm asking

02:49.770 --> 02:51.336
is if this is
the final draft or not.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.271
Booth, I'm not changing it!

02:53.307 --> 02:55.073
Wow, you guys really hit the
ground running this morning.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.876
Yeah, well, you know what?
There's a lot

02:57.911 --> 03:00.045
to hash out when your wife
is plotting your own murder.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.680
Ah! It's not you, it's a fictional character.
Yeah, okay.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.081
And it's not plotting

03:03.116 --> 03:04.382
if he's already dead.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.384
Booth is upset
that Agent Andy

03:06.420 --> 03:08.086
gets killed in
my latest book.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.088
No way!
See?

03:10.123 --> 03:11.289
Thanks for the spoiler alert.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.891
Murdered.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.125
Well, there's heavy
predation everywhere.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.360
The victim was a big meal

03:15.395 --> 03:16.861
- who was wrestled over.
- Okay, great.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.763
What are we saying here?
Coyotes? Let's move it along.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.065
The bite pattern
indicates coyotes,

03:20.100 --> 03:21.299
but the size

03:21.335 --> 03:23.401
of the bites is much bigger.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.737
This is the work
of coyote-wolf hybrids.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.839
Coywolves are as
versatile as coyotes,

03:27.874 --> 03:30.208
but like wolves,
they're apex predators.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.409
They migrated down...

03:31.445 --> 03:32.744
Coywolves, bad.
Got it. Thank you.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.746
Based on the heart-shaped
pelvic inlet

03:34.781 --> 03:38.183
and the granular appearance
on the pubic surfaces,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.752
the victim is
a white male in his 30s.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.354
Actually, a faceless
white male in his 30s.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.756
Maybe his wife and her editor
shot him in the face.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.058
Just saying.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.694
Actually, the hunters
who found the body

03:49.730 --> 03:51.663
shot the skull at close range
with a 12-gauge.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.237
Wow. So you're saying his face

03:53.238 --> 03:55.205
exploded all over
the ground here.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.680
Angie's got her work
cut out for her.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.475
There's no blowfly larvae,
which means

03:58.510 --> 04:00.777
the victim died within the last 24 hours.
Interesting.

04:00.812 --> 04:01.778
Interesting? Really?

04:01.813 --> 04:02.779
The blowflies? Because...

04:02.814 --> 04:03.780
No, not the bugs.

04:03.815 --> 04:05.382
Interesting that

04:05.417 --> 04:06.950
the victim's clothes,
they're all shredded up,

04:06.985 --> 04:09.686
but for the most part,
they're all here.

04:09.721 --> 04:11.688
Except for the shoes.
I see tissue

04:11.723 --> 04:14.724
on the posterior plane
of the right metatarsals.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.394
And the soles of the feet
look tender, not calloused.

04:17.428 --> 04:20.063
So we're not dealing
with a barefooted hiker.

04:20.098 --> 04:21.498
This man was definitely
dumped here.

04:21.533 --> 04:22.766
Which means our faceless friend
here was murdered.

04:22.801 --> 04:24.034
Just like Agent Andy.

04:24.069 --> 04:25.168
Just saying.

04:25.198 --> 04:25.821
Right?

04:25.822 --> 04:27.054
I'm gonna go this way.

04:27.089 --> 04:28.688
You can collect all your face.

Wow. Well, you guys
weren't kidding

05:12.596 --> 05:14.229
about the faceless skull.

05:14.264 --> 05:16.364
Dr. Hodgins is sifting
through the topsoil

05:16.399 --> 05:18.633
to find the rest
of the facial bones.

05:18.668 --> 05:21.102
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna
get an ID without them.

05:21.137 --> 05:22.503
Lucky for me,
there's enough brain tissue

05:22.539 --> 05:24.272
to run a tox screen.

05:24.307 --> 05:26.307
Dr. Wells, please note
the impact fractures

05:26.343 --> 05:28.710
to the manubrium
and the right humerus.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.111
Oh, I've already
noted those.

05:30.146 --> 05:32.046
The plotting indicates
blunt force trauma

05:32.082 --> 05:33.281
with a heavy,
rounded object,

05:33.316 --> 05:34.582
consistent with slamming
into a tree.

05:34.618 --> 05:36.184
And before you even ask,

05:36.219 --> 05:37.886
remodeling suggest
that the injury

05:37.921 --> 05:39.621
took place
two years ago.

05:39.656 --> 05:41.222
Dr. Wells, is everything okay?

05:41.258 --> 05:42.357
You seem....

05:42.392 --> 05:44.025
Even douchier than usual.

05:44.060 --> 05:45.226
I was going to say

05:45.262 --> 05:46.828
on edge.

05:46.863 --> 05:48.329
I am not concerned with
Dr. Wells' attitude.

05:48.365 --> 05:49.964
- Good.
- If it continues,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.399
he is easily replaceable.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.567
In fact, I've already enlisted

05:52.602 --> 05:54.269
the help of
an additional intern.

05:54.304 --> 05:55.837
Dr. Brennan, you didn't
clear this with me first.

05:55.872 --> 05:57.138
Trust me.

05:57.173 --> 05:58.840
Dr. Beth Mayer's brilliance

05:58.875 --> 06:02.010
as a forensic anthropologist
is unrivaled.

06:02.045 --> 06:04.579
With the exception of myself,
of course.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.714
This new intern,
she isn't hot, is she?

06:06.750 --> 06:07.982
You say "hot"

06:08.018 --> 06:09.751
like you would prefer "hideous."

06:09.786 --> 06:12.253
Dr. Mayer has
exceptional bone structure

06:12.289 --> 06:13.721
and perfect facial symmetry.

06:13.757 --> 06:14.956
Great.

06:14.991 --> 06:16.457
Now I'll have to deal

06:16.493 --> 06:18.259
with another gorgeous,
intelligent woman.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.965
<i> Look, if we're going</i>
<i>to get an ID on this guy,</i>

06:24.000 --> 06:25.233
it looks like our
best lead is gonna

06:25.268 --> 06:26.834
be the injury
he suffered.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.436
Yeah, I'm waiting on
hospital records

06:28.471 --> 06:30.238
for patients that got
into tree-related accidents

06:30.273 --> 06:31.773
around two years ago.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.242
Oh, by the way,

06:34.277 --> 06:36.277
I wanted to offer
my condolences.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.079
Condolences?

06:38.114 --> 06:40.148
Agent Andy.

06:40.183 --> 06:42.250
You're an idiot.

06:42.285 --> 06:43.985
Look, I'm with you. I mean,
Dr. Brennan's books are great,

06:44.020 --> 06:45.186
but you can't kill someone off

06:45.221 --> 06:46.487
and then have one character

06:46.523 --> 06:48.022
solving crimes all by herself.

06:48.058 --> 06:50.091
Time out. Technical.

06:50.126 --> 06:51.492
She's not going to do that.

06:51.528 --> 06:52.794
What do you mean?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.562
She's gonna replace
the character

06:54.597 --> 06:56.831
with a new, younger,
sexier partner.

06:56.866 --> 07:00.501
Well, in that case,
I'm really,<i> really</i> sorry.

07:00.537 --> 07:02.270
Why? It's-it's not your problem.

07:02.305 --> 07:03.638
I don't know.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.074
I mean, a new,
young, sexy partner? Huh?

07:06.109 --> 07:07.775
I'm probably the one
who inspired her

07:07.811 --> 07:09.177
to create the character.

07:09.212 --> 07:10.378
"Agent James"

07:10.413 --> 07:11.646
got a nice ring to it.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.181
Agent James...

07:15.318 --> 07:17.285
Oh! Look at that.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.320
Hospital records
just came through.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.755
What do we got?

07:20.790 --> 07:22.490
54 people smacked into
trees around that time,

07:22.525 --> 07:25.626
15 of them were white
males in their 30s.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.462
Get that to Cam, will you?
You got it.

07:27.497 --> 07:31.366
Another job well done
by Agent James.

07:41.811 --> 07:43.177
Dr. Hodgins,

07:43.213 --> 07:44.779
I was wondering
if I might assist you

07:44.814 --> 07:47.281
in separating the facial bones.
Sure, yeah.

07:47.317 --> 07:48.683
I've already given Angela
most of what she needs.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.318
Now I'm just sifting
for any stragglers.

07:50.353 --> 07:52.520
Flotation tanks
are more commonly used

07:52.555 --> 07:54.722
by archeologists
and geologists.

07:54.758 --> 07:56.991
You filled it with a solution

07:57.027 --> 07:58.526
of hydrogen peroxide and water?
That's right.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.495
So the debris will settle
according to weight.

08:00.530 --> 08:02.430
There'll be a layer of soil,
a layer of pebbles...

08:02.465 --> 08:03.998
And a layer of bone.

08:04.034 --> 08:06.100
Then all we have to do is
pick out the bigger rocks,

08:06.136 --> 08:07.368
sticks and leaves.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.636
Very well.

08:08.671 --> 08:11.039
So is everything okay?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.740
Heard you were feeling
a little stressed.

08:12.776 --> 08:14.375
Everything is fine.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.910
All systems
functioning perfectly.

08:15.945 --> 08:17.512
Functioning?

08:17.547 --> 08:18.746
In terms of
my performance.

08:18.782 --> 08:20.481
My performance here at work,

08:20.517 --> 08:22.250
not any other type
of performance.

08:22.285 --> 08:23.985
I'm not talking about my
performance anywhere else.

08:24.020 --> 08:26.220
Oliver, this is
a safe place, okay?

08:26.256 --> 08:27.889
It's just us guys in here.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.258
I-It's nothing. I am simply
dealing with something

08:30.293 --> 08:32.860
that 21 million other men

08:32.895 --> 08:34.761
in the U.S.
are-are dealing with.

08:34.798 --> 08:36.563
It's... it's a common problem,
really.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.232
What's a common problem?

08:42.238 --> 08:44.372
Erectile dysfunction.

08:44.407 --> 08:48.509
Ah. I see.
Yeah, no, I mean,

08:48.545 --> 08:50.678
you have absolutely nothing
to be embarrassed about.

08:50.713 --> 08:52.080
So you have experience
with this, as well?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.748
God, no.

08:54.684 --> 08:56.284
But if I did, you know,

08:56.319 --> 08:57.519
it would be completely normal.

08:57.554 --> 08:58.986
It's confounding,

08:59.022 --> 09:00.588
'cause normally, when
I'm faced with a problem,

09:00.623 --> 09:02.557
all I have to do
is focus on the variables.

09:02.592 --> 09:04.892
But I am not taking medication,
I'm not ill,

09:04.928 --> 09:06.561
I'm not overweight,
I'm not fatigued,

09:06.596 --> 09:08.396
and I don't consume alcohol
regularly.

09:08.431 --> 09:10.665
But the more I try to solve
this particular problem,

09:10.700 --> 09:12.133
the worse it gets.

09:12.168 --> 09:13.768
What problem?

09:14.637 --> 09:15.837
Nothing.

09:15.872 --> 09:17.905
Look at that.

09:17.941 --> 09:19.740
The layers have settled nicely.
Good.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.243
I was afraid Dr. Wells might
be causing trouble again.

09:22.278 --> 09:24.579
Dr. Saroyan,
I'd like to apologize

09:24.614 --> 09:26.013
for earlier.

09:26.049 --> 09:27.815
I haven't been feeling
myself as of late,

09:27.851 --> 09:29.350
and perhaps I took

09:29.385 --> 09:30.885
my frustration
out on the team.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.353
Apology accepted.

09:32.388 --> 09:34.455
And no hard feelings.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.891
No. None whatsoever.

09:44.134 --> 09:45.867
How's it coming with
the reconstruction?

09:45.902 --> 09:47.535
Oh, not great.

09:47.570 --> 09:48.803
Half the face is done,

09:48.838 --> 09:50.238
but the trouble is,

09:50.273 --> 09:51.405
some of these bone shards

09:51.441 --> 09:53.608
that Hodgins recovered
are so small

09:53.643 --> 09:55.743
that they're
practically dust.

09:55.778 --> 09:57.612
You should try to enlarge
the fragments digitally.

09:57.647 --> 10:00.014
It'll make it easier
to piece them back together.

10:00.049 --> 10:02.016
Dr. Mayer, you're here early.

10:02.051 --> 10:03.384
What can I say?

10:03.419 --> 10:04.685
I drive fast.

10:04.721 --> 10:05.920
Oh, my God.

10:05.955 --> 10:07.788
Your idea is brilliant.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.457
By enlarging
each fragment,

10:09.492 --> 10:12.894
the computer can better find
the contours of each piece.

10:12.929 --> 10:14.128
Wow.

10:14.164 --> 10:15.463
Oh, I'm Angela,
by the way.

10:15.498 --> 10:17.131
Oh.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.433
No, the pleasure
is mine.

10:19.469 --> 10:21.235
Especially now
that I get to see

10:21.271 --> 10:22.970
the Angelatron
in person.

10:23.006 --> 10:24.505
You know about
the Angelatron?

10:24.541 --> 10:26.641
Dr. Mayer developed the platform

10:26.676 --> 10:27.909
its graphic simulator
is based on.

10:27.944 --> 10:29.677
Well, actually,

10:29.712 --> 10:31.212
having created the Angelatron,

10:31.247 --> 10:34.081
I know that platform
was developed by a Dr. Brinkley.

10:34.117 --> 10:35.816
My name at the time.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.119
It was one of my
prior marriages.

10:38.154 --> 10:40.454
Oh. Oh, my God.

10:40.490 --> 10:42.390
Um... how many times
were you married?

10:42.425 --> 10:44.325
Six.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.494
Brinkley didn't last long.

10:47.697 --> 10:49.830
Fantastic lover, though.

10:52.702 --> 10:55.736
Wow, well, this is...

10:55.772 --> 10:57.471
this is an incredible honor.

10:57.507 --> 10:59.707
Oh.
Oh, look!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.108
We have a match.

11:01.144 --> 11:02.710
Justin Ross.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.612
He's a real estate agent

11:04.647 --> 11:06.380
with Franklin Realtors.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.782
Well, Brennan was right.

11:07.817 --> 11:09.250
You're amazing.

11:09.285 --> 11:11.285
No, I'm just experienced.

11:11.321 --> 11:15.389
So, uh, what do you
need me to do next?

11:18.461 --> 11:21.028
<i>So, all the employees at</i>
<i>Justin Ross's real estate firm</i>

11:21.064 --> 11:23.397
used ID badges
to clock in and out of work.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.899
How late was he
working last night?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.068
9:00 p.m.
9:00 p.m.? Okay, hello, after hours.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.769
Yeah, only one
other employee

11:28.805 --> 11:31.939
was working that late--
a, uh, Chris Winfelder.

11:31.975 --> 11:34.008
Custodian?
No, he's a temp.

11:34.043 --> 11:35.710
I picked him up while he
was putting up sign posts.

11:35.745 --> 11:37.278
Winfelder's been at
the firm for six months,

11:37.313 --> 11:39.180
which is pretty
long for him.

11:39.215 --> 11:41.048
He usually jumps
from job to job.

11:41.084 --> 11:42.817
I'll have to go find out why
he's bouncing around so much.

11:42.852 --> 11:45.186
He must be, you know, hiding
from someone or something.

11:45.221 --> 11:46.721
You got it.

11:46.756 --> 11:48.923
Oh, they still can't
get that coffee, right, huh?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.692
Mr. Winfelder?

11:51.728 --> 11:53.094
Special Agent James Aubrey.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.462
What's going on?

11:54.497 --> 11:55.663
I-I need
to get back to work.

11:55.698 --> 11:57.365
Well, this shouldn't
take long.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.734
Just need to ask you a few
questions about Justin Ross.

11:59.769 --> 12:01.702
So, the two of you
were both at work

12:01.738 --> 12:03.437
last night after
the office closed.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.706
Yeah, I was working
on a new listing.

12:05.742 --> 12:08.509
Which means that you were the
last person to see Ross alive.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.878
Well, wh-what
do you mean "alive"?

12:10.913 --> 12:12.847
Ross's body was found
this morning in the woods.

12:12.882 --> 12:13.882
He was murdered.

12:13.916 --> 12:16.150
Wow.

12:16.185 --> 12:19.086
Really?

12:20.523 --> 12:22.123
I'm sorry.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.924
I've never been told
someone's dead before.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.226
Can I, like, do that again?

12:25.261 --> 12:26.560
Uh, no.

12:26.596 --> 12:29.897
So, where'd you
go after work?

12:29.932 --> 12:30.998
I went home.

12:31.034 --> 12:32.333
I left after Ross.

12:32.368 --> 12:34.302
That means I can't be
a suspect, right?

12:34.337 --> 12:36.003
Well, you could've easily
just swiped his card,

12:36.039 --> 12:38.472
then waited,
then left yourself out.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.308
Th-this is crazy!

12:40.343 --> 12:41.976
I wouldn't hurt a fly.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.377
Literally,
if there's a fly at work,

12:43.413 --> 12:45.646
I shoo it towards a window
and set it free.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.848
Shooing flies-- got it.
So, you're a saint?

12:47.884 --> 12:49.216
I didn't say that.

12:49.252 --> 12:50.951
But...
I didn't kill Ross.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.753
Well, then what can
you tell me?

12:52.789 --> 12:54.322
Ross have any enemies at work?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.257
Maybe a fellow
real estate agent?

12:56.292 --> 12:59.160
He had some enemies
outside of work.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.428
Outside of work where?

13:00.463 --> 13:01.796
In his fantasy league.

13:01.831 --> 13:04.632
"Fantasy"-- you mean
he was a gamer?

13:04.667 --> 13:06.167
No, I'm talking
fantasy football.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.202
He was obsessed.

13:07.236 --> 13:08.836
Killed over fantasy football.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.404
Sounds like a stretch.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.839
No, you don't understand.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.607
I-I overheard threats.

13:13.643 --> 13:15.643
What kind of threats?
I don't know what about,

13:15.678 --> 13:17.044
but they were full-on,
screaming-at-the-top-

13:17.080 --> 13:18.346
of-your-lungs-type threats.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.747
I'm telling you it was

13:19.782 --> 13:22.650
his only life
outside of work.

13:22.685 --> 13:24.151
If you want to find out
who Ross's enemies were,

13:24.187 --> 13:27.855
dig through
his fantasy football account.

13:33.209 --> 13:34.175
Oh, wait a second.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.276
You play fantasy football?

13:35.311 --> 13:37.378
I'm the reigning two-time champ.

13:37.413 --> 13:39.080
It's a 12-team PPR league.

13:39.115 --> 13:41.249
12-team PPR league.

13:41.284 --> 13:43.384
That's exactly what I was in.
Well, before I, you know,

13:43.419 --> 13:45.786
before I...
Booth quit

13:45.822 --> 13:47.154
because he thought it was
a gateway to gambling, so...

13:48.625 --> 13:50.024
Oh, it looks like Angela

13:50.059 --> 13:52.793
got us access to Ross's league.

13:52.829 --> 13:53.961
That's gonna be
tons of information

13:53.997 --> 13:54.996
we're gonna have
to go through.

13:55.031 --> 13:56.998
Lots of transaction logs,

13:57.033 --> 13:58.466
e-mails; not to mention,

13:58.501 --> 14:00.101
all the trash talking
on the message boards.

14:00.136 --> 14:02.837
Oh, I love a good trash talking.

14:02.872 --> 14:03.804
Of course you do.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.573
I-I'm not sure

14:05.608 --> 14:06.974
I quite understand
what fantasy football is.

14:07.010 --> 14:08.142
Oh, you'd love it.

14:08.177 --> 14:10.044
It's a statistical game,

14:10.079 --> 14:12.046
where the members,
uh, form a league,

14:12.081 --> 14:14.081
and then they-they compete
against each other

14:14.117 --> 14:17.585
by drafting
real football players.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.053
Right, and your players,
they earn you points

14:19.088 --> 14:20.888
when they gain yards
or they catch passes

14:20.924 --> 14:22.256
or they score touchdowns.
Yeah.

14:22.292 --> 14:23.624
But these teams
don't technically exist.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.326
Oh, they take it
very seriously, Bones.

14:25.361 --> 14:26.961
Uh-huh.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.763
Oh, just like you and Agent
Andy-- he doesn't exist,

14:28.798 --> 14:30.965
but you're taking
his death quite seriously.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.566
You're killing Agent Andy?!

14:32.602 --> 14:33.935
But he's your husband.

14:33.970 --> 14:35.770
No, he's just a character.

14:35.805 --> 14:37.305
You know what I think?
You wrote that book

14:37.340 --> 14:39.941
after I quit the FBI.
You killed Andy

14:39.976 --> 14:41.842
when I quit my job.
No, that's absurd.

14:41.878 --> 14:43.278
Also, I'd appreciate it
if we didn't

14:43.313 --> 14:44.445
bicker in front
of Dr. Mayer.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.113
Oh, I don't mind.

14:46.149 --> 14:48.716
But we do have work to do.

14:48.751 --> 14:50.651
Um, check the top post.

14:50.687 --> 14:53.087
Well, it says "Hunting prey."
It's a video.

14:53.122 --> 14:55.690
How's it feel
to lose the season?

14:55.725 --> 14:57.325
Very funny, guys.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.793
Let's get it over with.

14:58.828 --> 15:00.261
Get what over with?
Well, sometimes, you know,

15:00.296 --> 15:01.796
♪whoever wins the fantasy
football league, you know,

15:01.831 --> 15:04.398
gets to pick a bad tattoo
for the loser or...

15:04.434 --> 15:05.366
Oh!

15:05.401 --> 15:07.601
Ow! Stop shooting!

15:07.637 --> 15:10.504
Or in this case, the winner
hunts down the loser

15:10.540 --> 15:12.440
with a paintball gun.

15:12.475 --> 15:14.342
These look like the same woods
where the victim was found.

15:14.377 --> 15:16.043
Looks like the video went viral.

15:16.079 --> 15:19.213
And this guy became the
laughingstock of his league.

15:19.248 --> 15:22.316
Ow! Ow! Ow!

15:22.352 --> 15:23.718
I'm gonna kill you, Justin!

15:23.753 --> 15:25.886
Ow! Ow!

15:30.193 --> 15:31.926
Ashlie Smith.

15:31.961 --> 15:33.527
Special Agent Aubrey, FBI.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.029
Your husband Craig home?

15:35.064 --> 15:37.365
Yeah, what's this about?
I need to ask him

15:37.400 --> 15:39.033
a few questions
about a friend of his

15:39.068 --> 15:41.068
in his fantasy football league--
a Justin Ross.

15:41.104 --> 15:42.536
Maybe you know him?

15:42.572 --> 15:44.572
No, sorry,
but you can follow me.

15:44.607 --> 15:47.908
Craig's in his man cave,
as usual.

15:47.944 --> 15:50.878
So, I take it he spends a lot
of time hibernating in his cave?

15:50.913 --> 15:54.081
If he's not at work,
he's here.

15:54.117 --> 15:55.916
Craig?

15:55.952 --> 15:57.685
I'm in the middle of something.

15:59.222 --> 16:01.722
Hey, Craig?

16:01.758 --> 16:03.924
FBI. Need to ask
you a few questions

16:03.960 --> 16:06.594
about your relationship
with Justin Ross.

16:06.629 --> 16:07.995
One sec.

16:08.031 --> 16:09.864
Sorry, the league
just got the news.

16:09.899 --> 16:11.165
It sucks.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.134
It's, like,
totally chaotic for us.

16:13.169 --> 16:14.502
"Chaotic"?
The commish says either

16:14.537 --> 16:16.170
someone has
to take over his team

16:16.205 --> 16:18.005
or we have to divvy up his
players to the rest of us.

16:18.041 --> 16:19.140
A man was murdered

16:19.175 --> 16:20.708
and you guys are worried about

16:20.743 --> 16:21.942
who gets his fantasy players?

16:21.978 --> 16:25.212
Yeah, it's sad,
but life goes on.

16:25.248 --> 16:27.281
Saw a video of Ross hunting
you down with a paintball gun.

16:27.316 --> 16:29.784
You got a pretty bad temper
on you.

16:29.819 --> 16:31.218
That stuff in the video
wasn't serious.

16:31.254 --> 16:33.721
It's the camaraderie
of the league.

16:33.756 --> 16:36.490
You said, quote, "I swear
I'm gonna kill you, Justin."

16:36.526 --> 16:39.260
I was getting shot
with paintballs!

16:39.295 --> 16:40.628
Please, settle down.

16:40.663 --> 16:42.363
Is there
anything important

16:42.398 --> 16:43.931
that you might want to tell us?

16:43.966 --> 16:45.166
Now would be a good time.

16:45.201 --> 16:46.801
Okay.

16:46.836 --> 16:48.602
You might want to talk
to Lou Divers.

16:48.638 --> 16:50.171
Lou Divers?

16:50.206 --> 16:53.774
Why would I want to talk
to an NFL starting running back?

16:53.810 --> 16:55.242
Divers stepped out of bounds
on a routine running play

16:55.278 --> 16:57.211
that cost Ross
a fantasy football game.

16:57.246 --> 16:59.480
So, big deal. Doesn't that kind
of stuff happen all the time?

16:59.515 --> 17:02.116
Well, Ross went online
and trash talked Divers

17:02.151 --> 17:03.818
until they got
into an intense Twitter war,

17:03.853 --> 17:05.486
which ended with Divers
paying Ross a visit

17:05.521 --> 17:06.787
right before he got killed.

17:06.823 --> 17:08.321
How do you know that

17:08.357 --> 17:10.257
Divers paid Ross a visit,
unless you were there?

17:10.292 --> 17:11.724
The whole league
knows about it.

17:11.761 --> 17:14.095
Just check Divers'
Twitter account.

17:16.699 --> 17:19.400
This is the last of the bones.

17:19.435 --> 17:21.469
The coywolves munched
some down all right.

17:21.503 --> 17:24.204
We're missing multiple medial
and distal phalanges,

17:24.240 --> 17:26.973
the scaphoid,
the trapezoid, the trapezium,

17:27.009 --> 17:29.577
the hamate and the capitate.

17:29.612 --> 17:32.313
Oh, don't forget
the shattered scapula.

17:32.348 --> 17:35.249
There appears to be a small nick
to the triquetral.

17:35.284 --> 17:38.085
Tangential trajectory
indicates it is a fracture,

17:38.121 --> 17:40.087
however, we won't be
certain what caused it

17:40.123 --> 17:41.589
unless we have
the missing bones.

17:41.624 --> 17:43.224
You know,

17:43.259 --> 17:45.693
the only way to get them
would be to go into the woods

17:45.728 --> 17:47.461
and track down the coywolves.

17:47.497 --> 17:49.130
Well, normally
I'm not one to endorse

17:49.165 --> 17:52.366
one of your ill-conceived
expeditions.

17:52.401 --> 17:54.602
However, I need those bones.

17:54.637 --> 17:56.170
You should take
Dr. Wells with you.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.705
Oh, no, no, no.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.373
I'd prefer to stay
in the lab.

17:59.408 --> 18:01.942
I'm not really the,
uh, outdoorsy type.

18:01.978 --> 18:03.244
Oh, nonsense.

18:03.279 --> 18:04.979
I can cover for both of you.

18:05.014 --> 18:09.350
Besides, being in nature
will be good for Mr. Happy.

18:13.189 --> 18:15.189
Excuse me?

18:15.224 --> 18:16.190
Wow.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.025
Do you miss anything?

18:19.061 --> 18:21.295
Not that I'm
confirming anything.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.897
It's okay.

18:22.932 --> 18:25.733
I'm around a lot of older men
with the same issue.

18:25.768 --> 18:29.336
After a while, you can
practically smell it on a man.

18:31.374 --> 18:34.441
Uh, I suppose a little exercise
could prove therapeutic.

18:34.477 --> 18:36.844
Forget exercise!

18:36.879 --> 18:38.946
What you need
is to get out of your head

18:38.981 --> 18:41.515
and go wild.

18:42.585 --> 18:44.051
With your permission, Dr. B?

18:44.086 --> 18:45.452
Go.

18:45.488 --> 18:47.388
And if it's any consolation,
Dr. Wells,

18:47.423 --> 18:49.290
I don't smell
anything different about you.

18:49.325 --> 18:51.058
Well, that's

18:51.093 --> 18:53.727
because Dr. Mayer's a lot
more perceptive than you are.

18:55.464 --> 18:57.364
Okay, let's go.

19:07.510 --> 19:10.211
Dr. Brennan kills off Agent Andy
when you're not working,

19:10.246 --> 19:11.946
so you, uh, take
a trip to the range?

19:11.981 --> 19:14.415
More like I have to take the
tactical retesting requirement.

19:14.450 --> 19:16.417
Oh, so the Bureau wants
to know if you still got it?

19:16.452 --> 19:18.452
Yeah, it's just protocol.

19:18.487 --> 19:20.788
Right, so I checked out
Lou Divers' Twitter feed.

19:20.823 --> 19:23.691
Turns out Divers
made multiple threats,

19:23.726 --> 19:26.193
including one that said he was
gonna pay Justin Ross a visit.

19:26.229 --> 19:27.995
Wait a second,
he deleted those tweets.

19:28.030 --> 19:29.730
Exactly, the threats

19:29.765 --> 19:30.965
mysteriously disappeared

19:31.000 --> 19:33.267
a few hours
after Ross was killed.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.703
Right.

19:35.738 --> 19:39.473
Oh, looks like you got
a few cobwebs to dust off.

19:39.508 --> 19:41.041
You missed the killer
by a few inches there, Booth.

19:41.077 --> 19:42.576
Oh, come on,
get with it, Aubrey.

19:42.612 --> 19:43.911
You see, that's
the innocent bystander.

19:43.946 --> 19:45.879
The killer's 30
feet away, Aubrey.

19:45.915 --> 19:48.015
Let's get with
the program, huh?

19:55.825 --> 19:57.424
<i>So, social media's</i>
<i>a crazy thing.</i>

19:57.460 --> 20:00.027
Isn't it, Lou?
What do you mean?

20:00.062 --> 20:02.329
Well, one minute you're being
praised by millions of fans,

20:02.365 --> 20:03.864
and the next,
you're in a Twitter war

20:03.899 --> 20:05.432
with a fantasy football player.

20:05.468 --> 20:07.167
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:07.203 --> 20:08.335
Online evidence
doesn't disappear

20:08.371 --> 20:09.837
just because you delete it.

20:09.872 --> 20:11.372
Getting in a Twitter fight's

20:11.407 --> 20:13.774
illegal now?
No, but murder is.

20:13.809 --> 20:15.709
You mean this guy's dead?
Yeah, he was killed

20:15.745 --> 20:17.478
the day that you showed up
to pay him a visit.

20:17.513 --> 20:19.546
You want to tell us why
some no-name fantasy fan's

20:19.582 --> 20:22.216
worth tracking down?
This guy took it too far.

20:22.251 --> 20:24.151
You know, I can
handle the trash talk,

20:24.186 --> 20:25.653
but when you threaten
my wife and kids,

20:25.688 --> 20:27.187
it's taking it
to a whole other level.

20:27.223 --> 20:28.322
So, you killed him and then
you covered your tracks

20:28.357 --> 20:29.990
by deleting the tweets.
No.

20:30.026 --> 20:31.325
I deleted those tweets because

20:31.360 --> 20:32.426
we figured this out in person.

20:32.461 --> 20:34.328
You made up?
Yeah.

20:34.363 --> 20:35.529
I mean, football's
a brutal sport, man,

20:35.564 --> 20:37.031
but I'm not a violent dude.

20:37.066 --> 20:38.432
I just needed to let him know

20:38.467 --> 20:40.000
that those threats
don't play well with me.

20:40.036 --> 20:41.068
And he took that well?

20:41.103 --> 20:42.836
Yeah, he was
remorseful actually.

20:42.872 --> 20:44.571
To be honest with you,
he was in a great mood.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.373
Hmm.
Any idea why?

20:46.409 --> 20:48.008
He was bragging
about some jackpot

20:48.044 --> 20:49.677
that he'd just won.

20:49.712 --> 20:51.178
Something about having
the highest scoring

20:51.213 --> 20:53.213
fantasy player
at every position.

20:53.249 --> 20:54.715
Really?
Yeah, it's, uh,

20:54.750 --> 20:55.883
nearly impossible,

20:55.918 --> 20:57.985
so I imagine that payout
was pretty big.

20:58.020 --> 21:01.155
So, somebody owes
our victim a lot of money.

21:03.114 --> 21:04.700
The injury that caused
the acromion

21:04.800 --> 21:06.917
to shatter was perimortem.

21:07.089 --> 21:08.689
Any idea what caused it?

21:08.724 --> 21:10.457
Not until we get
the missing bones.

21:10.493 --> 21:12.559
Would you like
Dr. Mayer to help you?

21:12.595 --> 21:13.794
I'm currently

21:13.829 --> 21:15.863
making excellent progress
without her.

21:15.898 --> 21:17.397
So... you know, besides,

21:17.433 --> 21:20.334
at her age,
she could use the rest.

21:20.369 --> 21:22.069
Actually she's in limbo
right now working.

21:22.104 --> 21:23.670
Limbo?

21:23.706 --> 21:25.339
What, um,

21:25.374 --> 21:26.874
what interest could she have

21:26.909 --> 21:29.026
with the remains
of unsolved cases?

21:29.061 --> 21:32.696
Does she think that she can
solve cases that I couldn't?

21:32.731 --> 21:33.964
No, relax, she just thought

21:33.999 --> 21:36.233
the remains were
sorted inefficiently.

21:36.268 --> 21:39.503
No, the remains
are categorized just fine.

21:39.538 --> 21:42.606
Well, she is photographing the
bones of each victim right now

21:42.641 --> 21:44.508
and uploading them
to the Angelatron,

21:44.543 --> 21:47.344
so we have a digital
database of limbo.

21:47.379 --> 21:51.215
I suppose that could
prove quite useful.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.717
You aren't jealous

21:53.752 --> 21:55.519
or feeling competitive
of Dr. Mayer, are you?

21:55.554 --> 21:57.087
No.

21:57.122 --> 21:59.323
No, I mean, I, what...

21:59.358 --> 22:01.892
I have no reason

22:01.927 --> 22:03.861
to be competitive with her,

22:03.896 --> 22:05.462
so... no.

22:06.765 --> 22:07.965
Okay.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.200
Just wanted to make sure.

22:10.236 --> 22:12.502
There appears to be a nick
on the anterior aspect

22:12.538 --> 22:14.238
of the scapula

22:14.273 --> 22:15.873
similar to the nature

22:15.908 --> 22:18.709
of the wound found
on the wrist.

22:18.744 --> 22:21.278
We should swab
for particulates.

22:21.313 --> 22:22.613
Well, unfortunately,
we'll have to wait

22:22.648 --> 22:23.780
for Dr. Hodgins
to return from the woods.

22:23.816 --> 22:25.182
I'll let Dr. Mayer know.

22:25.217 --> 22:26.817
She can run the
analysis easily.

22:30.356 --> 22:32.456
Of course she can.

22:35.928 --> 22:38.495
So this is where the
coywolves ate our victim?

22:38.530 --> 22:40.597
Yeah, and these tracks
run northwest.

22:40.633 --> 22:42.633
Coywolves prefer
areas with cover,

22:42.668 --> 22:44.067
like brush or shrubs.

22:44.103 --> 22:45.736
Then that's where we'll go.
Shall we?

22:45.771 --> 22:48.171
Hey, so, out of the lab
and in nature.

22:48.207 --> 22:49.439
Is anything, you know,

22:49.475 --> 22:50.707
awakening in you?

22:50.743 --> 22:52.309
No, and I'm growing
skeptical

22:52.344 --> 22:55.045
that simply being out of
the lab is going to fix my...

22:55.080 --> 22:57.347
Boner problem?
Yes. Thank you.

22:57.383 --> 22:59.249
Unfortunately, the only thing
I feel right now

22:59.285 --> 23:00.717
is tired and hungry.

23:00.753 --> 23:02.686
I haven't eaten anything
since this morning.

23:04.256 --> 23:05.889
Wait a minute.

23:05.925 --> 23:07.457
What is it?

23:07.493 --> 23:09.192
Well, the gut transit
time for canids

23:09.228 --> 23:10.694
is less than
a day, at most.

23:10.729 --> 23:12.696
It's much more rapid
than humans.

23:12.731 --> 23:14.765
So, technically, we're not
looking for coywolves.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.767
No, we're looking
for coywolf defecation.

23:16.802 --> 23:19.703
Coywolves usually defecate
in more conspicuous areas

23:19.738 --> 23:21.471
to mark their
territory.

23:21.507 --> 23:23.440
Like the edge of the woods,
near a trail,

23:23.475 --> 23:24.808
or by a body of water?
Yeah.

23:24.843 --> 23:26.176
Okay, let's go
towards the river.

23:26.211 --> 23:27.644
Hold on.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.980
We're not gonna need
these tranquilizer guns.

23:31.750 --> 23:32.983
You just shot me.

23:33.018 --> 23:34.651
That was an accident.

23:34.687 --> 23:35.886
Ah!

23:35.921 --> 23:37.354
You just shot me!

23:37.389 --> 23:39.556
Okay, chill out.
It's a low dose of Zoletil.

23:39.591 --> 23:40.824
You'll probably be fine.

23:40.859 --> 23:42.059
Probably?!

23:42.094 --> 23:43.393
Definitely.

23:43.429 --> 23:44.828
You'll definitely be fine.

23:44.863 --> 23:47.230
Ah... Oliver!
Come on.

23:47.266 --> 23:48.799
Ah... what?

23:48.834 --> 23:50.300
Just keep moving.

23:51.737 --> 23:53.337
<i>According to</i>
<i>the league's Web site,</i>

23:53.372 --> 23:56.173
Ross was owed $15,000

23:56.208 --> 23:58.208
by the commissioner,
Jamie Whetzel.

23:58.243 --> 24:00.043
And now that Ross is dead,
he gets to keep all the money.

24:01.313 --> 24:02.813
Money is always a strong motive.

24:02.848 --> 24:04.348
Oh, so is that why
you killed Agent Andy?

24:04.383 --> 24:05.582
To increase book sales?

24:05.617 --> 24:06.984
Absolutely not.

24:07.019 --> 24:09.152
But now that we're dealing
with the subject

24:09.188 --> 24:10.887
of money and
fantasy football...

24:10.923 --> 24:12.322
I was curious.

24:12.358 --> 24:14.257
Are your endorphin levels
rising?

24:14.293 --> 24:16.326
If you're asking me if I'm
getting the gambling itch,

24:16.362 --> 24:18.061
the-the answer's yes.
Oh.

24:18.097 --> 24:20.931
That was not the response
I was expecting.

24:20.966 --> 24:22.532
Well, I'm never gonna hide
things anymore, Bones.

24:22.568 --> 24:24.968
You know, covering
builds it up inside.

24:25.004 --> 24:26.403
When I get an urge,

24:26.438 --> 24:27.671
I acknowledge it.

24:27.706 --> 24:29.373
I think about the
pros and the cons

24:29.408 --> 24:31.375
that gambling
added to my life,

24:31.410 --> 24:33.610
and then I can let it go.

24:33.645 --> 24:35.612
Hmm.

24:35.647 --> 24:37.647
What does a fantasy football
commissioner do, anyway?

24:37.683 --> 24:38.849
Well, their job

24:38.884 --> 24:40.217
is to put the
league together--

24:40.252 --> 24:41.718
you know, run the draft,
handle the money

24:41.754 --> 24:43.653
and basically, you know,
control the game.

24:43.689 --> 24:46.023
Sounds like a lot of
responsibility for one person.

24:46.058 --> 24:47.391
Which is why you
have to be unbiased

24:47.426 --> 24:48.725
to be a good
commissioner.

24:48.761 --> 24:51.628
They have all the power.

24:53.399 --> 24:55.132
Welcome to Sandwich Hut.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.367
I'm Jamie, what can I get you?

24:56.402 --> 24:57.601
Answers.

24:57.636 --> 24:59.569
FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

24:59.605 --> 25:01.338
This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

25:01.373 --> 25:02.672
From the Jeffersonian.
Yes.

25:02.708 --> 25:05.142
FBI?
And a forensic anthropologist.

25:05.177 --> 25:06.410
This must be about Justin.

25:06.445 --> 25:08.045
Uh, let's talk over here.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.447
You are the all-powerful
commissioner of the league?

25:10.482 --> 25:11.782
I am the commissioner.

25:11.817 --> 25:13.016
I don't know about
"all-powerful."

25:13.052 --> 25:14.317
Whetzel!

25:14.353 --> 25:15.986
Less socializing, please.

25:16.021 --> 25:17.554
Hey, I'm talking
to the FBI, here!

25:17.589 --> 25:18.789
Watch your tone, Whetzel.

25:20.292 --> 25:21.858
Sorry about that.

25:21.894 --> 25:24.294
So, what was your relationship
with Justin Ross like?

25:24.329 --> 25:26.096
He was a good man

25:26.131 --> 25:27.531
and a valued member
of our league.

25:27.566 --> 25:29.266
It's just devastating
what happened.

25:29.301 --> 25:30.634
I find it coincidental

25:30.669 --> 25:32.135
that he won a fantasy jackpot

25:32.171 --> 25:33.737
right before he was killed.

25:33.772 --> 25:35.839
What are you implying?
What she's saying is that

25:35.874 --> 25:37.874
$15,000 goes
a long way

25:37.910 --> 25:40.610
for somebody who works
at the Sandwich Hut.

25:40.646 --> 25:42.479
I am an honorable commissioner

25:42.514 --> 25:43.980
and I take that very seriously.

25:44.016 --> 25:46.116
In fact, I already
made plans to put

25:46.151 --> 25:47.651
his full 15 grand
towards his funeral costs.

25:47.686 --> 25:49.119
I can show you the invoice.

25:49.154 --> 25:51.621
Where were you Wednesday night?
Here.

25:51.657 --> 25:53.990
I worked the night shift;
closed the shop.

25:54.026 --> 25:55.759
Are all of the members
of your league

25:55.794 --> 25:57.961
as fanatical as Ross was?

25:57.996 --> 26:00.097
Look, fantasy players have
pulled over to make trades

26:00.132 --> 26:01.798
while driving their pregnant
wives to the hospital.

26:01.834 --> 26:04.468
That's for sure.
One dude was at war in Afghanistan

26:04.503 --> 26:06.169
and wouldn't retreat from
his post that was being bombed

26:06.205 --> 26:07.637
because he was
in the middle of a draft.

26:07.673 --> 26:09.306
I heard of that guy,
yeah, right.

26:09.341 --> 26:10.574
I mean, commitment
to a league

26:10.609 --> 26:12.142
is what makes it great.

26:12.177 --> 26:13.543
It may also be
what led to murder.

26:13.579 --> 26:14.845
You're right.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.213
Loving the league is no excuse.

26:16.248 --> 26:17.647
What happened is horrible.

26:17.683 --> 26:18.882
Whetzel!

26:18.917 --> 26:20.350
Let's go!

26:20.385 --> 26:22.953
Should I tell my manager
you guys need me longer?

26:22.988 --> 26:24.287
Please?
Nah, tell you what.

26:24.323 --> 26:25.889
I'm just gonna need
those invoices

26:25.924 --> 26:27.057
from the funeral costs.

26:27.092 --> 26:28.758
That's me.
Okay.

26:28.794 --> 26:30.460
You can get in touch with us
if anything comes up there.

26:30.496 --> 26:32.295
Absolutely.
Right?

26:32.331 --> 26:34.531
do I need to tell you?

26:34.566 --> 26:37.434
Guacamole is a dollar more!

26:37.469 --> 26:39.002
I'm sorry, you're right,
you're right.

26:39.037 --> 26:41.071
I'm sorry.

26:44.443 --> 26:46.476
Hey, how's it going?

26:46.512 --> 26:48.545
Oh, there's my baby.

26:48.580 --> 26:49.813
It's slow.

26:49.848 --> 26:51.548
Like honey.

26:51.583 --> 26:53.617
Mmm. Honey is so good.

26:53.652 --> 26:56.119
Are you okay?

26:56.155 --> 26:58.421
Uh, yeah. Oliver shot me
with a tranquilizer gun.

26:58.457 --> 27:00.390
Oh, my God!

27:00.425 --> 27:01.825
No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

27:01.860 --> 27:03.660
It was an accident,
we're still friends,

27:03.695 --> 27:05.395
his wiener's feeling better,

27:05.430 --> 27:06.830
so it's, uh, it's awesome.

27:06.865 --> 27:08.665
Angie, did you find anything?
Yeah, actually.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.934
So I was digging
through Ross's computer

27:10.969 --> 27:12.369
and it looks like Ross

27:12.404 --> 27:14.638
was helping his temp,
Chris Winfelder,

27:14.673 --> 27:16.740
get his house
out of foreclosure.

27:16.775 --> 27:18.108
Oh, my God,
that's so nice of him!

27:18.143 --> 27:19.442
Yeah, not exactly.

27:19.478 --> 27:21.511
They had a last-minute buyer
lined up,

27:21.547 --> 27:23.547
but it looks like
Ross screwed up the deal

27:23.582 --> 27:25.015
by missing an important meeting.

27:25.050 --> 27:27.517
That's so mean of him!
Now, on top of that,

27:27.553 --> 27:30.187
Dr. Mayer found
traces of an aluminum alloy.

27:30.222 --> 27:33.123
Angie, Winfelder's signs.

27:33.158 --> 27:34.524
They're made of aluminum alloy.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.892
Yeah, yeah.
Exactly.

27:35.928 --> 27:37.594
What is going on out there?

27:37.629 --> 27:39.196
Does Oliver have his shirt off?

27:40.732 --> 27:43.166
Yeah.

27:43.202 --> 27:44.401
He thinks he's a wolf.

27:47.940 --> 27:49.439
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

27:49.474 --> 27:52.142
Hey, Angela,
I'm finally out of my head.

27:52.177 --> 27:54.244
I can actually feel
Mother Earth

27:54.279 --> 27:56.146
breathing new life
into me.

27:56.181 --> 27:58.415
Okay.
Ooh, wait a second.

27:58.450 --> 27:59.749
What is it?

27:59.785 --> 28:01.084
Uh, something
on Ross's computer.

28:01.119 --> 28:02.285
He has a Fit-Step account.

28:02.321 --> 28:03.887
It's a digital pedometer

28:03.922 --> 28:06.256
that tracks how many steps
you take every day.

28:06.291 --> 28:07.557
What's the big deal?

28:07.593 --> 28:10.994
I think I took about
seven steps today.

28:11.029 --> 28:12.896
Wait, what's with
the Fit-Step?

28:12.931 --> 28:15.398
It's just weird
that he accumulated steps

28:15.434 --> 28:16.866
after he was murdered.

28:16.902 --> 28:18.134
The latest Fit-Steps

28:18.170 --> 28:19.302
have a GPS.

28:19.338 --> 28:20.403
If the killer took it,

28:20.439 --> 28:21.571
then we can track them down.

28:21.607 --> 28:23.573
Yeah, but it was
accumulating steps

28:23.609 --> 28:26.343
for about six hours
and then stopped.

28:26.378 --> 28:27.577
Oh, my God.

28:27.613 --> 28:30.113
Maybe a coywolf
ate the Fit-Step.

28:30.148 --> 28:32.649
And then he pooped it out.

28:32.684 --> 28:34.584
Like a poop machine...

28:34.620 --> 28:35.819
that poops.

28:37.155 --> 28:39.256
So if I can track
the Fit-Step...

28:39.291 --> 28:41.358
Then we can find
the missing bones.

28:41.393 --> 28:43.393
Yeah. I'll send the GPS
coordinates to you.

28:43.428 --> 28:46.630
Hey. Can you please get back
in one piece?

28:46.665 --> 28:47.931
Oh, Angie,
we have a song for you!

28:47.966 --> 28:49.165
No, you have nothing
to worry about.

28:49.201 --> 28:50.600
We're gonna sing you a song.

28:50.636 --> 28:51.835
I've heard the song.
It's not great.

28:51.870 --> 28:53.036
You do the "do-do-do" part.

28:53.071 --> 28:54.304
♪ Do-do-bee-do-bee-do. ♪

28:54.339 --> 28:55.572
We're gonna go look

28:55.607 --> 28:56.906
- for wolf... wolf poop.
- But I need to just...

28:59.177 --> 29:00.710
You lied to me,
Mr. Winfelder.

29:00.746 --> 29:02.646
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:02.681 --> 29:03.980
Ross screwed you

29:04.016 --> 29:06.349
by sending your house
into foreclosure.

29:08.287 --> 29:09.819
I didn't lie.

29:09.855 --> 29:12.455
I just left that out because
it would've looked bad.

29:12.491 --> 29:13.890
You mean because it
would've given you motive?

29:13.925 --> 29:15.458
That's not what I meant.

29:15.494 --> 29:17.494
Must have made you pretty
angry to lose that house.

29:17.529 --> 29:19.229
Been in your family
three generations.

29:19.264 --> 29:20.497
Of course it did, but...

29:20.532 --> 29:22.098
You couldn't stand the fact

29:22.134 --> 29:23.867
that Ross missed
the last-minute meeting

29:23.902 --> 29:25.302
with a potential buyer

29:25.337 --> 29:26.870
because he was too distracted

29:26.905 --> 29:28.838
by fantasy football.
You're right

29:28.874 --> 29:30.273
that I couldn't stand him,
but fantasy football

29:30.309 --> 29:31.708
isn't why he screwed me over.

29:31.743 --> 29:32.842
What do you mean by that?

29:32.878 --> 29:34.077
He missed our meeting

29:34.112 --> 29:36.446
because he was busy with a lady.

29:36.481 --> 29:38.081
Okay, so Ross had a girlfriend?

29:38.116 --> 29:39.482
Maybe a girlfriend.

29:39.518 --> 29:41.484
It felt a little shadier
than that,

29:41.520 --> 29:43.987
the way they would sneak around
and close the blinds

29:44.022 --> 29:45.488
in his office during lunch
and everything.

29:45.524 --> 29:47.590
So Ross was having an affair.

29:47.626 --> 29:48.892
You ever meet this woman?

29:48.927 --> 29:50.126
A couple of times.

29:50.162 --> 29:52.228
Her name was Ashlie.

29:52.264 --> 29:53.830
Ashlie Smith?

29:53.865 --> 29:55.432
No clue what
her last name is.

29:59.137 --> 30:00.937
Is that her?

30:00.972 --> 30:03.306
Yeah, I'll never forget her.

30:03.342 --> 30:05.709
She's the reason
I lost my house.

30:10.952 --> 30:12.118
Hey.

30:12.153 --> 30:14.153
Hey. There you are.

30:14.189 --> 30:15.555
Are you okay?
Yeah.

30:15.590 --> 30:16.923
Thankfully,
the tranquilizer

30:16.958 --> 30:18.458
is finally out
of my system.

30:18.493 --> 30:20.793
And you were successful
tracking the Fit-Step?

30:20.829 --> 30:22.695
Yeah, very.
Both the Fit-Step and the bones

30:22.730 --> 30:26.065
were buried in a pile of
defecation, just like I thought.

30:26.101 --> 30:27.633
So, where are the bones?

30:29.804 --> 30:33.039
Hello, ladies.

30:35.243 --> 30:36.676
Cam.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.014
It's still "Dr. Saroyan."

30:42.050 --> 30:44.851
Yes. Yes, it is.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.552
Wow, you, uh...

30:46.588 --> 30:48.955
you seem to be feeling better.
Yeah.

30:48.990 --> 30:50.156
Turns out Dr. Mayer was right.

30:50.191 --> 30:51.424
All I needed
was a little fresh air

30:51.459 --> 30:52.925
to get the blood flowing

30:52.961 --> 30:54.794
to the proper areas...

30:54.829 --> 30:57.396
I think we should focus on the bones.
Yeah. Good idea. Come on.

30:57.432 --> 30:59.432
The sooner we find these bones
and clean them for Dr. B.,

30:59.467 --> 31:01.300
the sooner
we can solve this case.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.403
Oof.

31:04.439 --> 31:07.406
Let's do this!

31:10.078 --> 31:11.511
Uh, it seems like you guys

31:11.546 --> 31:13.613
have a handle on
this situation, so...

31:13.648 --> 31:15.047
Agreed.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.283
Good luck with that.

31:20.889 --> 31:24.090
<i>Cheating on your husband</i>
<i>with our murder victim</i>

31:24.125 --> 31:25.491
doesn't look too good.

31:25.527 --> 31:27.093
Make a habit of lying,
Mrs. Smith?

31:27.128 --> 31:29.795
Anyone in my position
would've done the same.

31:29.831 --> 31:33.232
And what position
is that?

31:33.268 --> 31:35.468
My husband hasn't looked at me
in years.

31:35.503 --> 31:38.404
He comes home from work,
goes straight into his man cave,

31:38.439 --> 31:40.573
and plays fantasy football
until he falls asleep.

31:40.608 --> 31:42.775
Is that why you cheated on him
with someone from his league?

31:42.810 --> 31:44.477
To get back at him?
No.

31:44.512 --> 31:45.978
Where were you
on Wednesday night?

31:46.014 --> 31:47.780
I was home.
Husband verify that?

31:47.815 --> 31:49.115
No, he wasn't there.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.816
Where was he that night?
I don't know.

31:50.852 --> 31:52.919
Did he know
about the affair?

31:54.455 --> 31:55.821
Yeah.

31:57.525 --> 31:59.192
We had a typical fight

31:59.227 --> 32:00.693
over him watching
too much football,

32:00.728 --> 32:02.528
and he yelled at me
to back off,

32:02.564 --> 32:05.164
and that's when I told him
I was sleeping with Justin.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.499
And how did he react?

32:06.534 --> 32:08.067
I-I didn't see.
I slammed the door and left,

32:08.102 --> 32:09.435
and the next thing I knew, R...

32:09.470 --> 32:11.270
Ross was dead.
Mrs. Smith,

32:11.306 --> 32:14.473
did your husband
kill Justin Ross?

32:14.509 --> 32:17.843
I don't know.

32:20.882 --> 32:23.583
I mean, I can't imagine
he would, but...

32:23.618 --> 32:27.987
but I don't even know
who he is anymore.

32:28.022 --> 32:30.556
Oh, my God...

32:32.627 --> 32:35.595
We have the scaphoid,
the trapezoid,

32:35.630 --> 32:37.763
the trapezium,
the hamate, the capitate,

32:37.799 --> 32:41.500
the phalanges, and the rest
of the shattered acromion,

32:41.536 --> 32:43.769
all clean of
coywolf defecation.

32:43.805 --> 32:47.240
The bones are finally ready
to be re-articulated.

32:47.275 --> 32:49.442
And I finally have my mojo back.

32:49.477 --> 32:51.010
Which should
please Dr. Mayer.

32:51.045 --> 32:52.478
Where is she currently?

32:52.513 --> 32:55.648
Uh, she is updating
the Angelatron's interface.

32:55.683 --> 32:57.283
But we're perfectly
fine without her.

32:57.318 --> 32:59.919
Your lobbying to spend
one-on-one time with me

32:59.954 --> 33:02.588
is quite flattering,
Dr. Brennan.

33:02.624 --> 33:05.024
But, come on, we
have work to do.

33:05.059 --> 33:07.026
Now that we've found
the rest of the acromion,

33:07.061 --> 33:10.997
we can determine what caused
the nick on the scapula.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.266
There are two circular pits,

33:13.301 --> 33:16.002
indicating the victim
was stabbed twice

33:16.037 --> 33:17.737
with a cylindrical weapon
with a diameter

33:17.772 --> 33:19.605
of four to five millimeters.

33:19.641 --> 33:21.707
A nail, perhaps?

33:21.743 --> 33:24.877
The angle at which

33:24.912 --> 33:27.046
the weapon
shattered the acromion

33:27.081 --> 33:29.015
would've severed
the subclavian artery.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.550
Which would've caused our victim
to bleed out within minutes.

33:31.586 --> 33:33.519
We have cause of death.

33:33.554 --> 33:34.887
My mojo's not done.

33:34.922 --> 33:38.424
The size of
the circular pits

33:38.459 --> 33:40.626
is nearly identical.

33:40.662 --> 33:44.230
Indicating the stabs were made
with exactly the same force.

33:44.265 --> 33:45.631
Four millimeter diameter,

33:45.667 --> 33:48.267
two stabs with
identical force.

33:48.303 --> 33:49.969
It's quite feasible
that our killer

33:50.004 --> 33:51.904
used a nail gun.

33:51.939 --> 33:54.774
Booth is going to visit
a suspect right now

33:54.809 --> 33:56.709
who works
as a contractor.

33:56.744 --> 33:58.644
I-I'll let him know
immediately.

34:01.349 --> 34:03.449
<i>All these killings</i>

34:03.484 --> 34:05.551
over loved ones-- maybe
this is why I'm still single.

34:05.586 --> 34:07.019
Look, are we talking
about our suspect

34:07.055 --> 34:08.920
or are we talking
about Agent Andy here?

34:08.956 --> 34:10.956
You're still hung up on that?

34:10.992 --> 34:12.792
On what, being killed? Yeah.

34:12.827 --> 34:15.895
Look, maybe
Dr. Brennan was just

34:15.929 --> 34:18.864
going through something in her writing.
Okay.

34:18.900 --> 34:21.300
That doesn't make
it okay to off me.

34:21.335 --> 34:22.467
Look at the alternative.

34:22.503 --> 34:23.835
I mean, we are headed
to the house

34:23.871 --> 34:26.472
of a neglected wife
who cheated

34:26.507 --> 34:27.773
on her murder-suspect
husband.

34:27.809 --> 34:29.408
Dr. Brennan got it
out through her writing

34:29.444 --> 34:31.043
and you guys
are strong as ever.

34:31.079 --> 34:32.812
Still mad, though.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.650
Craig Smith, FBI!

34:38.686 --> 34:40.753
Front door's open,
coming in!

34:40.788 --> 34:43.356
Craig? Anybody home?

34:43.391 --> 34:44.657
You think he split?

34:44.692 --> 34:45.824
His truck's there.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.326
Come on!

34:47.362 --> 34:49.061
Okay, man cave.

34:49.097 --> 34:51.731
Yeah, we'll see
about that, tough guy!

34:51.766 --> 34:54.934
Try it again,
I'll rip your face off!

34:54.969 --> 34:57.303
That's a load of crap!
Just make the trade!

34:57.338 --> 35:01.006
Craig Smith, we need you to
come with us for questioning.

35:01.042 --> 35:02.575
Hold on, I'm in the middle
of a big trade.

35:02.610 --> 35:04.110
No, no, pal, okay,
put the phone down.

35:04.145 --> 35:06.278
Hang it up, step away
from the computer, let's go.

35:06.314 --> 35:07.613
I only need a few seconds!

35:07.648 --> 35:09.849
Okay, listen, let's go.
Come on, man.

35:09.884 --> 35:11.250
What are you doing?

35:11.285 --> 35:12.485
I'm in the middle of a trade!
Come on.

35:13.721 --> 35:15.955
You have no idea
what you just did!

35:15.990 --> 35:17.890
You might've just
cost me the whole season!

35:17.925 --> 35:19.792
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa,
slow down. Wait a second.

35:19.827 --> 35:21.060
You tried trading
an RB1 for Wallace?

35:21.095 --> 35:22.828
What, are kidding me?

35:22.864 --> 35:24.530
No wonder you came
in last last season.

35:24.565 --> 35:25.798
That's a horrible trade.

35:25.833 --> 35:26.999
Get off me!

35:30.025 --> 35:31.800
Let me go or so help me God!

35:31.900 --> 35:33.639
Whoa, hey, look at that.

35:33.739 --> 35:35.172
There's the temper
that we saw

35:35.208 --> 35:36.807
in the paintball video
in the woods.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.143
And look at that, it's his trusty nail gun.
Oh.

35:39.178 --> 35:41.345
If you don't let me go, I'll...
Take my advice.

35:41.380 --> 35:42.713
Whatever you're
about to say, don't.

35:42.748 --> 35:44.748
He'll let you up
once you calm down.

35:44.784 --> 35:45.950
You ruined my trade!

35:45.985 --> 35:47.251
Well, you got
a lot more problems

35:47.286 --> 35:48.619
than a fantasy football
league, pal.

35:48.654 --> 35:49.753
Yeah, like how it drove

35:49.789 --> 35:51.488
your wife into Ross's arms.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.891
Somebody with a temper like
yours must've flipped out

35:53.926 --> 35:55.259
when you found out
that she was cheating on you.

35:55.294 --> 35:56.894
How would you react?

35:56.929 --> 35:58.095
Are you gonna let go now?!

35:58.130 --> 35:59.130
Come on.

35:59.165 --> 36:00.264
In a minute, okay?

36:00.299 --> 36:01.966
So how did you react, huh?

36:02.001 --> 36:04.735
Did you go pay your little
fantasy football kid a visit?

36:04.770 --> 36:06.470
Yeah, but not
to kill him.

36:06.505 --> 36:08.205
So, you just drove
out to see him

36:08.241 --> 36:09.707
to politely ask
for an explanation?

36:09.742 --> 36:12.209
No, I told him
I would forgive him

36:12.245 --> 36:14.311
if he gave me Aaron Rodgers,
his fantasy quarterback.

36:14.347 --> 36:15.813
Whoa, wait a second.

36:15.848 --> 36:17.248
You wanted him to give you
a quarterback

36:17.283 --> 36:18.415
for sleeping with your wife?!

36:18.451 --> 36:20.217
He's a premium quarterback!

36:20.253 --> 36:21.986
And I deserved him!

36:22.021 --> 36:23.687
You deserve that
and more, Craig.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.089
Take it easy, we couldn't
do the trade anyway.

36:25.124 --> 36:26.857
It was considered collusion.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.626
Right and your little peace
offering didn't go through.

36:28.661 --> 36:30.694
So?
So that means you still have a motive.

36:30.730 --> 36:31.996
Let's go, pal, come on.

36:32.031 --> 36:34.798
Let's go, come on.

36:34.834 --> 36:36.834
Booth has Craig Smith
in custody.

36:36.869 --> 36:38.636
Unfortunately, we still
don't have hard evidence.

36:38.671 --> 36:40.905
Well, I may have found something
in the carpal bones.

36:40.940 --> 36:42.907
There appear
to be puncture wounds

36:42.942 --> 36:45.209
on the trapezium and hamate

36:45.244 --> 36:46.644
similar to those
found on the scapula.

36:46.679 --> 36:48.078
Looks like they were both

36:48.114 --> 36:50.180
caused by the same
cylindrical murder weapon.

36:50.216 --> 36:53.951
But these stabs were inflicted
with much less force.

36:53.986 --> 36:56.854
Yeah, and the distance
between punctures

36:56.889 --> 36:59.223
is approximately
three centimeters.

36:59.258 --> 37:03.193
Which means the murder weapon
made two stabs at a time.

37:03.229 --> 37:05.429
So we're looking
for a two-pronged weapon.

37:06.866 --> 37:09.967
Hodgins just sent results
from the defecation.

37:10.002 --> 37:14.004
It looks like the coywolves
recently feasted on...

37:14.040 --> 37:16.840
<i>Sus domesticus.</i>

37:16.876 --> 37:18.142
They ate pigs?

37:18.177 --> 37:20.311
Perhaps they got into a farm?

37:20.346 --> 37:23.681
No, these pigs
were cured with salt.

37:25.217 --> 37:27.418
I know the murder weapon.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.119
You do?

37:29.155 --> 37:31.388
I see it now as well.

37:31.424 --> 37:32.823
Two prongs,

37:32.858 --> 37:34.692
cured meat.

37:34.727 --> 37:36.961
Dr. Mayer, you should be
the one to call Booth.

37:36.996 --> 37:40.030
Good work.

37:43.536 --> 37:46.704
<i>We found a lot</i>
<i>of angry messages to you</i>

37:46.739 --> 37:49.006
from Ross that were sent
before he was murdered.

37:49.041 --> 37:50.574
That doesn't mean
I killed him.

37:50.609 --> 37:52.009
Commissioners of every league

37:52.044 --> 37:53.610
deal with angry messages
all the time.

37:53.646 --> 37:54.812
You know, you
had every right

37:54.847 --> 37:56.213
to veto that
Aaron Rodgers trade.

37:56.248 --> 37:57.688
I mean, that would've
been collusion.

37:57.717 --> 37:59.984
Any commissioner
would've vetoed that trade.

38:00.019 --> 38:01.518
But that must've been
the last straw for Ross,

38:01.554 --> 38:03.687
who wasn't happy
with you as commissioner.

38:03.723 --> 38:06.490
That's why Ross went to confront
you at the sandwich shop.

38:06.525 --> 38:08.692
And when you didn't
approve the Aaron Rodgers trade,

38:08.728 --> 38:10.728
he was gonna oust you
as commissioner.

38:12.198 --> 38:14.365
You can't prove anything.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.033
That's when a
fight escalated.

38:16.068 --> 38:18.369
You grabbed your
little meat holder there

38:18.404 --> 38:20.137
and stabbed him two times.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.772
How did you...?

38:21.807 --> 38:23.440
Then you dumped
the body in the woods

38:23.476 --> 38:24.775
and you covered it with ham,

38:24.810 --> 38:26.510
so it would attract
the wild animals.

38:26.545 --> 38:27.911
We got your murder weapon,

38:27.947 --> 38:30.347
and evidence that ties
the ham back to you.

38:30.383 --> 38:32.683
Game over, Whetzel.

38:34.086 --> 38:36.487
Yeah, I killed him.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.022
I'm a sandwich artist.

38:38.057 --> 38:39.456
The league is all I had.

38:39.492 --> 38:42.226
Ross wanted
to take that from me.

38:46.799 --> 38:49.566
♪ Time ain't nothing ♪

38:49.602 --> 38:52.469
♪ If it ain't fast ♪

38:52.505 --> 38:55.773
♪ Taking everything ♪

38:55.808 --> 39:00.144
♪ That you ever had ♪

39:00.179 --> 39:03.347
♪ Giving nothing in return... ♪

39:03.382 --> 39:05.582
I never thought I'd say this,

39:05.618 --> 39:07.584
but I thoroughly enjoy hiking.

39:07.620 --> 39:09.553
It's good to be back
at full strength.

39:09.588 --> 39:11.889
Yeah, me, too,
after being tranqued.

39:11.924 --> 39:15.159
Dr. Hodgins, while I appreciate
you helping me get my mojo back,

39:15.194 --> 39:18.028
I fully maintain that you
overreacted to the tranquilizer.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.697
And I maintain
that you shot me.

39:20.733 --> 39:21.899
It's a harmless dart.

39:21.934 --> 39:23.567
Are you really
gonna stand by that?

39:23.602 --> 39:25.135
Yes, it's
a non-lethal dose

39:25.171 --> 39:26.570
meant to relax
40-pound mammals.

39:26.605 --> 39:27.905
Okay, Oliver,

39:27.940 --> 39:30.007
this is your last
chance to take back

39:30.042 --> 39:31.375
that I overreacted.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.943
It was nothing.
Okay.

39:35.147 --> 39:36.413
What are you doing?

39:36.449 --> 39:37.548
Oh, nothing.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.450
I brought this
in case we ran

39:39.485 --> 39:42.519
into some overly
aggressive coywolves,

39:42.555 --> 39:43.654
but now I'm gonna shoot you,

39:43.689 --> 39:45.255
and then we'll be even.

39:45.291 --> 39:47.424
That is
a ridiculous concept.

39:47.460 --> 39:49.426
Oh, don't worry, it's a, uh--
what did you call it?--

39:49.462 --> 39:51.762
a, um, harmless dart?

39:51.797 --> 39:54.364
Dr. Hodgins,
put down the gun.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.366
I think we both know that
you're not going to shoot...

39:56.402 --> 39:58.035
Aah!

39:58.070 --> 40:00.604
Ow!

40:00.639 --> 40:02.306
You shot me!

40:02.341 --> 40:03.841
Don't worry.

40:03.876 --> 40:05.542
It's a non-lethal dose.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.180
This better not reverse my mojo.

40:11.383 --> 40:14.017
Aah!

40:19.024 --> 40:20.491
I must admit

40:20.526 --> 40:22.392
this is an extremely
efficient way

40:22.428 --> 40:24.027
to catalogue the remains.

40:24.063 --> 40:27.664
Thank you.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.000
I...

40:30.035 --> 40:33.170
I need to apologize.

40:33.205 --> 40:34.872
Instead of gaining insight

40:34.907 --> 40:37.841
from your years
of experience, I...

40:37.877 --> 40:40.444
I acted in a jealous manner.

40:43.082 --> 40:45.916
Is it too late to seek
advice from you?

40:45.951 --> 40:47.518
Oh, never.

40:47.553 --> 40:49.153
What's on your mind?

40:50.289 --> 40:52.789
Booth thinks
that I was going through

40:52.825 --> 40:54.758
something subconsciously
that caused me

40:54.793 --> 40:57.161
to kill off Agent Andy.

40:57.196 --> 40:59.997
That perhaps I was
angry with him.

41:00.032 --> 41:01.865
And were you?

41:02.968 --> 41:05.102
No.

41:05.137 --> 41:08.138
When I wrote the book, we were
both taking time off from work.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.542
It was a period of
complete peace and quiet.

41:11.577 --> 41:12.976
Oh!

41:13.012 --> 41:14.578
No wonder you lashed out.

41:14.613 --> 41:16.947
What do you mean?

41:16.982 --> 41:18.382
Come on.

41:18.417 --> 41:20.551
Gals like us can't stand
peace and quiet.

41:20.586 --> 41:23.387
We need to be challenged.

41:25.891 --> 41:28.458
That's why I loved
seeing you and Booth together.

41:28.494 --> 41:29.927
But all you witnessed
was us bickering.

41:29.962 --> 41:31.595
Yeah, exactly.

41:31.630 --> 41:34.264
Because you pushed each other.

41:34.300 --> 41:37.534
That's the heat
you fell in love with.

41:37.570 --> 41:39.736
And that's the heat
that will keep you together.

41:39.772 --> 41:41.505
Anything else would be...

41:41.540 --> 41:44.575
Boring.

41:44.610 --> 41:46.043
And when things get boring,

41:46.078 --> 41:48.512
that's when you start
killing characters.

41:48.547 --> 41:51.381
Oh, come on, Dr. Brennan.

41:51.417 --> 41:53.784
What you and Booth have
is special.

41:53.819 --> 41:57.454
Embrace the heat.

41:58.591 --> 42:00.591
It has been an honor

42:00.626 --> 42:03.594
to work with you, Dr. Mayer.

42:03.629 --> 42:05.562
Thank you.

42:05.598 --> 42:07.631
But don't make it sound
like this is it.

42:07.666 --> 42:11.168
I'm not going anywhere.

42:13.939 --> 42:16.373
<i>Dr. Mayer has been working</i>

42:16.408 --> 42:18.375
for two more years
than Cam, Hodgins,

42:18.410 --> 42:20.577
Angela and myself combined.

42:20.613 --> 42:22.112
Wow, she is some lady.

42:22.147 --> 42:23.847
She actually gave me

42:23.882 --> 42:25.582
some insight
into Agent Andy, too.

42:25.618 --> 42:27.884
Oh, you know,
that-that reminds me.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.119
You were right.

42:29.154 --> 42:30.654
Of course I was.

42:30.689 --> 42:31.888
About what?

42:31.924 --> 42:33.523
About not bring back Agent Andy.

42:33.559 --> 42:34.925
That was a good call.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.627
New beginnings for us, right?

42:36.662 --> 42:38.028
Well, actually,
I believe there may be

42:38.063 --> 42:39.930
a way to bring him back now.

42:39.965 --> 42:41.531
Why would you
want to do that?

42:41.567 --> 42:43.467
Booth, you were the one
fighting to keep him alive.

42:43.502 --> 42:44.735
Yeah, you know, but
then I thought about it.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.503
Well, think about it some more.

42:46.538 --> 42:48.005
There are plenty of creative
ways for Andy to survive!

42:48.040 --> 42:49.606
Someone shot to the sternum?!

42:49.642 --> 42:51.275
Okay, come on, do you know
how fatal that is, Bones?

42:51.310 --> 42:52.709
Booth, you're
questioning my knowledge

42:52.745 --> 42:55.245
of an injury to the sternum?

42:55.281 --> 42:57.347
Oh, really, you're questioning
my, uh, gun shots.

42:57.383 --> 42:58.415
