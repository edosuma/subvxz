WEBVTT

00:01.031 --> 00:03.383
Then why don't you check
the *** next to the pantry?

00:04.476 --> 00:06.671
I'm sorry, Robert, but I...
I don't know where they are.

00:06.726 --> 00:09.334
I'll tell you what, I'll get another
set made on my way home.

00:12.479 --> 00:15.381
Look, babe, I really have to go.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.850
Yeah, sure, that's fine.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.920
Okay, I love you too.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.955
Bye-bye.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.725
My apologies.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.093
Everything okay?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.895
Yeah, Robin just couldn't find her keys.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.796
Rough morning? Perhaps I
should take over the pre-op?

00:30.831 --> 00:33.399
That will not be necessary.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.734
Shall we?

00:34.768 --> 00:36.936
Please.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.638
Just a heads-up:

00:38.672 --> 00:40.640
the board is gonna push you
for more growth.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.642
The bottom line has them concerned.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.143
When hasn't it? Can set my watch

00:44.177 --> 00:45.344
over their money worries.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.646
I'll be fine.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.980
It's different this time.

00:48.015 --> 00:51.517
C-Suite feels we can better recognize

00:51.551 --> 00:53.819
how medicine and business
are one and the same.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.154
Ah, let me guess:

00:55.188 --> 00:56.956
scale back on outreach,

00:56.990 --> 00:59.592
combine responsibilities, outsource?

00:59.626 --> 01:02.261
So basically, sacrifice patient care?

01:02.296 --> 01:04.030
I won't do that, Peter.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.665
Well, Sharon, you have to do something,

01:05.699 --> 01:08.534
because the ED is hemorrhaging cash,

01:08.568 --> 01:09.936
and if the bleeding doesn't stop,

01:09.970 --> 01:11.637
it's not going to be good for anybody.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.539
- Mm.
- Need I remind you

01:13.573 --> 01:17.109
Randall Memorial closed their ED?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.280
Dr. Halstead, Doris, you're with me.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.015
- Copy that.
- Barry?

01:23.050 --> 01:24.684
Alex Mayer, 23.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.552
Slash and stab.
Large diagonal lacerations

01:26.586 --> 01:27.720
of the abdomen.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.155
He's a little tachy. GCS 15.

01:29.189 --> 01:30.156
Get it out!

01:30.190 --> 01:31.190
You're going Baghdad.

01:31.224 --> 01:32.224
Get it out!

01:32.259 --> 01:33.659
The weapon still in?

01:33.694 --> 01:34.794
I don't know. Wasn't even a call.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.062
We were a few blocks away,

01:36.096 --> 01:37.463
I saw him on the street, bleeding,

01:37.497 --> 01:38.965
loaded him in the ambo and rolled.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.733
- I can feel it inside me!
- Whoa, whoa!

01:40.767 --> 01:41.801
Alex, keep your hands down.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.336
I got you, Dr. Halstead.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.670
Let's transfer.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.139
On my count. One, two, three!

01:49.509 --> 01:50.977
Two of Versed to calm him down.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.712
Thank you, boys.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.817
- How's that Versed coming?
- On it, Doctor.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.585
Gaping diagonal incision

01:59.619 --> 02:00.886
of the right upper quad.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.154
Evidence of evisceration?

02:02.189 --> 02:03.723
No, I can see the base.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.725
Abdomen's still intact.
Just a flesh wound.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.059
It's really clean, though.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.360
Wash it out and stitch it up.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.362
Irrigation.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.930
Sir, you're a lucky man.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.065
Whoever knifed you
didn't do any serious damage.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.169
Look at this. Betadine's smeared

02:17.204 --> 02:18.571
all over the abdomen.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.939
The skin was prepped before the cut.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.774
I'm telling you,
that incision is precise.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.677
Back-alley surgery gone wrong?

02:24.711 --> 02:26.212
Alex, what happened?

02:26.246 --> 02:27.446
I was desperate.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.549
Dr. Halstead, his hand, under the blood.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.917
More Betadine.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.220
So he doused his own hands.

02:34.254 --> 02:35.855
Alex, did you cut into yourself?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.590
I had to! I had to get it out!

02:37.624 --> 02:38.858
Get what out?

02:38.892 --> 02:41.293
The person living inside me!

02:46.892 --> 02:51.062
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:53.840 --> 02:55.808
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.877
Are you all right?
I was just trying to say "hi."

02:57.911 --> 03:00.046
Um, it's Edith Lake.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.647
Your insulin patient?

03:01.681 --> 03:03.949
The woman who slashed my tires?

03:03.984 --> 03:06.619
Oh, the woman you think
slashed your tires.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.220
Who else?

03:08.255 --> 03:09.622
I saw her yesterday,

03:09.656 --> 03:11.257
across the street from my apartment.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.493
You really think it was her?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.562
Looked like her.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.464
Next.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.905
Dr. Latham, this is Ray Preston, 53.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.573
Fell short of breath while jogging.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.241
I was only two miles in.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.644
I'm always good for five
before I start to get tired.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.179
Ray lives in Galena.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.314
It's about 3 1/2 hours west of Chicago.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.450
His cardiologist performed an EKG,

03:37.484 --> 03:39.418
stress test, and cardiac cath.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.853
Told me to skip the community hospital

03:40.887 --> 03:43.689
and come straight here.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.957
Dr. Rhodes, I know we're getting

03:44.991 --> 03:46.125
pretty close to show time here,

03:46.159 --> 03:47.126
but are you absolutely sure

03:47.160 --> 03:48.127
I need this surgery?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.929
I'm positive.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.297
But I'm not in any pain.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.332
I know, that's the danger.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.334
Severe three-vessel disease,
complicated by...

03:55.368 --> 03:58.370
Heavy calcification
and extremely poor targets.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.805
CABG is still doable,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.841
but it will be more
challenging than normal.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.209
Indeed.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.610
You're a lucky man, Mr. Preston.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.145
Keeping fit bought you the time

04:06.179 --> 04:07.446
to notice something was wrong.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.548
Yeah. Well, Dr. Rhodes said

04:09.583 --> 04:11.183
people with arteries as damaged as mine

04:11.218 --> 04:12.485
usually just drop dead.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.788
He's absolutely right.

04:15.822 --> 04:18.457
Not to worry, Ray.
We'll take great care of you.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.128
<i>To streamline costs,</i> Dr. Stohl and I

04:22.162 --> 04:24.663
are implementing a
system to track supplies

04:24.698 --> 04:26.332
to know exactly what we've used.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.200
Everything will be barcoded

04:28.235 --> 04:29.969
and logged into Pyxis.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.637
It will operate by finger scan,

04:31.671 --> 04:33.172
like we do for medications.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.741
That's easy enough for minor treatments,

04:35.775 --> 04:37.309
but what about emergencies?

04:37.344 --> 04:40.237
Not a lot of time to stop down and
scan your prints during a trauma.

04:40.308 --> 04:42.748
A tech will take note
of what was used in the moment

04:42.782 --> 04:45.384
and then scan after the fact.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.019
"In the moment." They'll follow us

04:47.053 --> 04:48.921
into the trauma bay?

04:48.955 --> 04:51.357
Between nurses and equipment,
we're already tight on space.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.358
Another body...

04:52.392 --> 04:53.392
We'll find the room

04:53.426 --> 04:55.694
because we have to.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.063
Not to worry, Miss Goodwin.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.266
All right, uh, let's get back to work.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.600
Thank you for your time.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.902
Doctors, one more thing before you go,

05:02.936 --> 05:05.704
while I have you here, charting.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.106
When I was in Attending,

05:07.140 --> 05:09.108
it was pen, paper, and long-form.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.911
Today, it's... it's tablets
and shorthand.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.747
I get it... tech saves time...

05:14.781 --> 05:16.782
but details get lost in translation,

05:16.816 --> 05:20.586
so please be explicit
in procedure notes.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.688
Okay? Document everything.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.224
If you do it, write it down.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.225
Okay?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.867
I clean up nice, don't I?

05:34.901 --> 05:36.035
I haven't noticed.

05:36.069 --> 05:40.072
I saw that.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.708
Why don't you believe me?

05:42.742 --> 05:44.243
I'm not crazy.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.712
Something lives inside of me,
right here.

05:46.746 --> 05:47.913
I hear you. I understand.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.215
Then get it out!

05:49.249 --> 05:51.050
I feel it all the time!

05:51.084 --> 05:55.955
Alex... we're gonna help you, I promise.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.090
Sedative?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.425
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.293
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.928
I'm telling you the truth.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.563
I can feel it inside of me.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.432
Please.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.438
Please...

06:18.144 --> 06:19.411
What'd you give him?

06:19.446 --> 06:20.579
Five of Versed.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.914
Hm.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.316
Two probably would have sufficed.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.517
He put hands on you.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.020
I was being cautious.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.421
So what are you thinking?

06:29.456 --> 06:30.823
Schizophrenia.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.191
Yeah, that was my initial thought,

06:32.225 --> 06:33.425
but now I'm not so sure.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.928
Seriously? His, uh, paranoia

06:35.962 --> 06:37.463
that there's something
living inside him,

06:37.497 --> 06:38.831
and his attempt to remove it

06:38.865 --> 06:40.132
is literally a textbook definition

06:40.166 --> 06:42.534
of a somatic delusional disorder.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.803
I'm stuck on the level of premeditation.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.772
You know, sterilization with Betadine,

06:46.806 --> 06:48.474
the clean incision,

06:48.508 --> 06:49.875
doing it near a hospital...

06:49.909 --> 06:51.610
All that kind of forethought...

06:51.645 --> 06:53.946
it's just not consistent
with schizophrenic psychosis.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.048
So he's a germophobe with a steady hand.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.150
It doesn't mean he's not schizophrenic.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.119
Mm, could be true, too.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.222
So, um... start him on anti-psychotics

07:03.256 --> 07:04.690
and reassess when his mind's clear?

07:04.724 --> 07:06.392
I'm just not there yet.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.993
My gut tells me it's chemical.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.863
You know, like maybe
a methamphetamine overdose.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.865
Before we go any further,
let's run a tox screen,

07:12.899 --> 07:15.234
see if he's just... high.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:26.079 --> 07:28.847
What's with you? You look half-dead.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.483
Yeah, these 90-hour weeks
are killing a brother.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.385
Law says you can't do more than 80.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.188
When Dr. Stohl asks you to volunteer,

07:36.222 --> 07:37.890
you don't say "no."

07:37.924 --> 07:40.192
Game is rigged.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.861
All part of being a big-shot doc.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.730
Big shot, right.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.067
Big shot, living off of
ramen and cheeseburgers.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.702
What?

07:49.736 --> 07:51.203
Yeah, that's all I got time for.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.339
You are getting a steady paycheck now.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.441
Sign up for one of
those meal delivery services.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.343
You're gonna need the fuel.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.012
That's not a bad idea.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.414
Hey, um...

08:02.449 --> 08:05.117
do you mind setting it up for me?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.218
What? You...

08:06.252 --> 08:08.354
you always know what I like.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.388
Sure.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.456
Thank you.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.457
Thank you, thank you.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.058
I'ma try to get some Zs

08:13.093 --> 08:16.729
before the troll hawks me
for more rounds.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.900
Don't give me that look.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.073
Mm-hmm. Okay.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.441
Thank you, Helen.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.776
Bye.

08:30.810 --> 08:31.944
Good news:

08:31.978 --> 08:34.446
Helen's gonna watch Owen tonight.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.614
Watch as in all night?

08:35.648 --> 08:36.815
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.486
Just one thing I ask.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.486
Anything.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.757
That you shave.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.458
You don't like the sandpaper feel, huh?

08:46.493 --> 08:48.127
Uh-huh.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.294
You ask a lot...

08:49.329 --> 08:50.596
Mm.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.164
But okay.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.867
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.905
Proximal anastomosis is complete.

08:59.939 --> 09:00.939
That looks good.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.341
Let's move on to the base.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.942
Do you have a suitable landing spot?

09:03.977 --> 09:05.344
Yeah.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.146
Lighter calcification in this area.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.614
Potts, please.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.082
I'd go more distal.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.317
Vessel's bigger.
You'll get a cleaner target.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.987
This area of vessel is perfect.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.923
If you say so.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.324
8-0 Prolene.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.993
The artery could probably
handle the 7-0.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.594
I prefer the 8-0.

09:22.629 --> 09:23.862
Just thought the larger stitch

09:23.897 --> 09:25.197
might be easier for you to work with.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.598
I don't understand the debate.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.200
The difference between vessel location,

09:28.234 --> 09:29.935
and now suture choice, is negligible.

09:29.969 --> 09:31.270
Good point, Dr. Latham.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.538
Dr. Rhodes, you're lead surgeon.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.639
I'm only assisting.

09:33.673 --> 09:36.208
I defer to your preference.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.477
Thank you, Doctor.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.612
Now, how about from here on out,

09:40.647 --> 09:43.449
we keep the background noise
to a minimum?

09:47.987 --> 09:49.455
Myra Adams, 20.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.823
Passed out in her bathroom
washing her face.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.191
Struck her head as she fell.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.292
Chamber two.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.495
GCS 6. BP 128 over 60, heart rate 102

09:56.529 --> 09:57.896
Her brother Eric's a step behind.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.498
- Total wreck.
- Hey, uh, what's...

09:59.532 --> 10:01.033
what's wrong with her?

10:01.067 --> 10:02.334
She's tensing up. Decorticate posturing.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.069
- Can you hear me?
- Excuse us.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.070
Can you tell me your name?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.672
Responds to pain.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.173
All right, we're gonna transfer
on my count.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.508
One, two, three.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.143
Uh, she was complaining

10:11.177 --> 10:12.311
about her stomach last night.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.579
I-I told her it was, like,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.147
uh, something that she ate.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.415
It's okay. Please give the doctor

10:16.449 --> 10:17.583
some room to examine her.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.018
Okay.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.653
Clear breath sounds bilaterally.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.722
CBC, CMP, coags, and u-tox.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.157
Nat, belly's soft.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.725
All right, nasal airway and a head CT.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.227
And while we're there, let's scan

10:28.261 --> 10:29.394
her C spine and belly, okay?

10:29.429 --> 10:30.429
We're on it.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.900
All right, let's move her.

10:36.903 --> 10:40.038
Look, I-I should have
brought her in last night.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.241
Uh, why... why is this happening to her?

10:42.275 --> 10:43.575
Look, we're gonna do everything we can

10:43.610 --> 10:45.010
to help your sister, okay?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.712
She's lucky you found her when you did.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.947
I-I gotta, uh, call my parents.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.282
Sure.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.586
This level of posturing...

10:54.621 --> 10:55.954
Has to be some sort of brain injury.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.422
Yeah.

10:59.799 --> 11:01.899
Thank you.

11:01.934 --> 11:03.611
Uh, we're looking for
our daughter, Myra Adams.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.268
Our son called. Is she all right?

11:05.302 --> 11:08.070
Come with me, please.
Dr. Manning, Dr. Choi.

11:08.105 --> 11:09.439
These are Myra's parents.

11:09.473 --> 11:10.516
What happened?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.241
We talked to her two days ago.
She was fine.

11:12.276 --> 11:13.242
Myra?

11:13.277 --> 11:14.321
Myra, honey!

11:14.346 --> 11:15.392
Oh, please, I'd like to see her.

11:15.417 --> 11:17.418
Yes, of course, please.

11:22.739 --> 11:24.544
- Honey.
- What's going on?

11:25.433 --> 11:26.600
I don't know.

11:26.635 --> 11:28.669
You poor baby.

11:28.703 --> 11:30.337
Myra?

11:30.372 --> 11:31.605
Honey?

11:31.640 --> 11:32.606
We're here.

11:32.641 --> 11:33.641
What's wrong with her?

11:33.675 --> 11:35.342
We don't know yet.

11:35.377 --> 11:36.744
She collapsed in the bathroom

11:36.778 --> 11:38.279
and hasn't regained consciousness.

11:38.313 --> 11:39.580
We don't think it's a brain injury.

11:39.614 --> 11:41.749
Myra's CT scans were clear.

11:41.783 --> 11:44.351
Last month, her friends
brought her in to the ED.

11:44.386 --> 11:46.253
Could that have something
to do with this?

11:46.288 --> 11:48.455
Honey, that doctor said
she was just dehydrated.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.659
She, uh, got an IV. She was, uh...

11:51.693 --> 11:53.494
she was fine.

11:53.528 --> 11:55.029
We checked her chart.

11:55.063 --> 11:56.630
Back then, Myra's tox screen
and blood work

11:56.665 --> 11:58.966
was normal,
except she was slightly anemic.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.834
Same as now. She vegetarian?

12:00.869 --> 12:01.869
Vegan.

12:01.903 --> 12:03.304
As long as I can remember.

12:03.338 --> 12:05.039
Never liked meat.

12:05.073 --> 12:06.635
Well, that would explain the anemia.

12:06.690 --> 12:08.424
Is there anything else you can tell us?

12:08.459 --> 12:11.027
Uh, she, um...

12:11.061 --> 12:13.229
What?

12:13.264 --> 12:15.565
No, it's just, uh, it was finals week,

12:15.599 --> 12:17.534
so she wasn't really, like, eating,

12:17.568 --> 12:19.035
or sleeping much at all.

12:19.069 --> 12:21.337
She always worked so hard.

12:21.372 --> 12:23.873
I tell her all the time,
she needs to rest.

12:23.908 --> 12:27.210
How do you know all that?

12:27.244 --> 12:28.578
I've been staying with her.

12:28.612 --> 12:30.280
Since when?

12:33.717 --> 12:35.084
Myra?

12:35.119 --> 12:36.419
She's tachycardic and tachypneic.

12:36.453 --> 12:37.720
That means her heart is racing

12:37.755 --> 12:38.721
and she's having trouble breathing.

12:38.756 --> 12:40.123
We need to intubate her.

12:40.157 --> 12:41.624
Please let the doctors help her, okay?

12:41.659 --> 12:43.860
- My baby, no, oh, God.
- Please, okay?

12:43.894 --> 12:45.628
Let's get an EEG and LP,

12:45.663 --> 12:48.064
an antibiotics and antiviral,
just in case.

12:48.098 --> 12:49.198
Gram of Ceftriaxone,

12:49.233 --> 12:50.967
500 milligrams Acyclovir.

12:51.001 --> 12:52.802
Why is it happening? Why?

12:57.908 --> 13:00.043
And lift.

13:00.077 --> 13:01.744
I still would've landed the grafts

13:01.779 --> 13:05.448
more distal, but your way worked, too.

13:05.482 --> 13:07.717
I'll take that as a "nice job."

13:07.751 --> 13:09.552
Didn't know my approval
meant so much to you.

13:09.587 --> 13:13.790
Always on, aren't you?

13:13.824 --> 13:16.459
"Always on." What does that mean?

13:16.493 --> 13:19.329
Nothing. It's just, um...

13:19.363 --> 13:21.164
steel sharpening steel.

13:21.198 --> 13:23.967
Hmm, can't say I'm any more enlightened.

13:25.869 --> 13:27.437
BP's falling. We're in to the 80s.

13:27.471 --> 13:28.738
Anterior lateral ST elevations.

13:28.772 --> 13:30.239
Damn it. Cardiac ischemia.

13:30.274 --> 13:32.141
One of your grafts must have went down.

13:32.176 --> 13:33.343
All right, get him back on the table.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.911
I'll go back in to fix the graft.

13:34.945 --> 13:35.945
No, we've already broken down the room.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.113
By the time we re-prep,

13:37.147 --> 13:38.114
we'll have lost too much time.

13:38.148 --> 13:39.482
IR's a better option.

13:39.516 --> 13:41.184
What about the hybrid room?

13:41.218 --> 13:42.919
I have it booked for
a stenotic dialysis arm graft.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.287
I'll bump it and cath Ray.

13:44.321 --> 13:45.955
If I can't fix the issue noninvasively,

13:45.990 --> 13:47.757
room's already prepped
for us to re-open him up.

13:47.791 --> 13:49.759
Dr. Rhodes?

13:51.195 --> 13:52.295
It's a good idea.

13:52.329 --> 13:53.963
Okay, let's go.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.475
Myra's lumbar puncture was negative.

14:05.509 --> 14:06.776
There's no infection.

14:06.810 --> 14:10.113
However, her EEG was
positive for seizures.

14:10.147 --> 14:11.447
We've put her on Ativan,

14:11.482 --> 14:13.483
but unfortunately,
they haven't subsided.

14:13.517 --> 14:14.851
Myra's always been so healthy.

14:14.885 --> 14:16.285
I just don't understand.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.187
But the Ativan, it'll work, right?

14:18.222 --> 14:19.722
Well, we're gonna do an MRI

14:19.757 --> 14:21.324
to get a closer look at her brain,

14:21.358 --> 14:24.127
see if there's something
that the CT didn't pick up.

14:24.161 --> 14:25.294
- Oh, my God.
- What... what's happening?

14:25.329 --> 14:27.030
She's posturing again.

14:27.064 --> 14:29.632
I'm afraid whatever's going on
in her brain is getting worse.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.367
Her pupils are sluggish.

14:31.402 --> 14:32.702
Bolus another five milligrams

14:32.736 --> 14:33.970
of Ativan on top of the drip

14:34.004 --> 14:35.672
and get her up to MRI, quickly.

14:35.706 --> 14:36.906
Hey, can I... can I go with her?

14:36.940 --> 14:37.907
Sure.

14:37.941 --> 14:39.909
No, no.

14:39.943 --> 14:43.079
Eric, you stay with us.

14:43.113 --> 14:45.481
I'm gonna order an echo,
check for heart vegetations.

14:45.516 --> 14:47.016
You're thinking sepsis,

14:47.051 --> 14:49.318
but her white blood cell count
was totally normal.

14:49.353 --> 14:50.887
Everything was normal
the last time she was here,

14:50.921 --> 14:52.722
too, but she's back,
even worse than before.

14:52.756 --> 14:54.257
Ethan, these two ED visits

14:54.291 --> 14:55.825
could be totally unrelated.

14:55.859 --> 14:56.993
No, I think they missed
something last time.

14:57.027 --> 14:57.994
Missed what?

14:58.028 --> 14:59.162
I don't know.

15:03.367 --> 15:04.600
Don't beat yourself up, Connor.

15:04.635 --> 15:06.235
Grafts fail,

15:06.270 --> 15:08.071
often in patients
with far less calcification

15:08.105 --> 15:09.105
than Ray.

15:09.139 --> 15:10.540
Doesn't make any sense.

15:10.574 --> 15:12.341
I checked every graft before I closed.

15:12.376 --> 15:13.342
They were solid.

15:13.377 --> 15:14.677
They still are.

15:14.712 --> 15:16.846
Good flow through all repaired vessels.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.347
One, two, three.

15:18.382 --> 15:19.949
The problem is here.

15:19.983 --> 15:22.185
Clot of the left anterior
descending artery.

15:22.219 --> 15:24.387
Likely a bad reaction to the protamine

15:24.421 --> 15:26.122
administered during anesthesia.

15:26.156 --> 15:27.623
Recommendations on how to proceed?

15:27.658 --> 15:29.792
Treat noninvasively with heparin.

15:29.827 --> 15:31.127
Thin the blood, let his heart

15:31.161 --> 15:32.695
clear the clot out on its own.

15:32.730 --> 15:34.030
Too conservative.
Clot's already stopped up

15:34.064 --> 15:35.765
the vessel. The LAD is the widow-maker.

15:35.799 --> 15:37.700
If it's down much longer,
Ray's not coming back.

15:37.735 --> 15:40.036
We've got to suck it out.

15:40.070 --> 15:41.738
I agree with Dr. Bekker.

15:41.772 --> 15:43.873
Thrombo-aspiration,
though the riskier procedure,

15:43.907 --> 15:46.476
ensures complete removal
of the blockage.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.777
Excuse me, Dr. Rhodes.

15:53.417 --> 15:56.486
Alex's tox screen's
negative for methamphetamine.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.154
Negative for all drugs,
in fact... he's clean.

15:58.188 --> 16:00.089
Yeah, I saw the report.

16:00.124 --> 16:02.091
So now can we start him
on a course of anti-psychotics?

16:02.126 --> 16:05.328
I'm just still not convinced
it's schizophrenia.

16:05.362 --> 16:06.996
How? He's presented with

16:07.030 --> 16:08.631
more than enough evidence
of a thought disorder

16:08.665 --> 16:09.999
to warrant the diagnosis.

16:10.033 --> 16:11.434
Yeah, but even so, before today,

16:11.468 --> 16:12.969
I mean, his medical record's clean.

16:13.003 --> 16:15.138
History doesn't track
with schizophrenia.

16:15.172 --> 16:16.739
Or meth addiction.

16:16.774 --> 16:17.840
He doesn't fit the profile
of a user, either.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.308
Just 'cause he's clean today,

16:19.343 --> 16:21.744
doesn't mean he's free of the drug.

16:21.779 --> 16:23.246
So that's what the fan is for?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.615
White noise, Dr. Charles? Really?

16:25.649 --> 16:26.682
Yes, really.

16:26.717 --> 16:28.417
White noise has been proven

16:28.452 --> 16:30.686
to trigger auditory hallucinations

16:30.721 --> 16:32.622
in meth users.

16:32.656 --> 16:33.756
How long have you been waiting

16:33.791 --> 16:34.824
for something to happen?

16:36.226 --> 16:37.527
Hm, seven or eight minutes.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.929
How long does it usually take?

16:39.963 --> 16:42.832
Two or three.

16:42.866 --> 16:44.200
Probably not meth. Go ahead,

16:44.234 --> 16:46.903
start anti-psychotics.

16:49.807 --> 16:52.408
Two of Haldol...

16:54.211 --> 16:55.444
Dr. Charles...

16:57.214 --> 16:58.614
Oh, my God.

16:58.649 --> 17:00.016
Alex... get his hand, get his hand!

17:00.050 --> 17:03.886
I needed it gone. Just see... wait!

17:03.921 --> 17:05.188
Help! We need some help in here!

17:08.157 --> 17:09.559
What happened?

17:09.593 --> 17:11.027
He used a pen to pop the stitches

17:11.060 --> 17:12.060
and chisel through his abdominal wall.

17:12.095 --> 17:13.849
- Clearly.
- All right, no time to re-pack.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.298
Got to scoop and move. Saline.

17:15.332 --> 17:17.500
Okay, call OR. Tell them
we're coming immediately.

17:17.534 --> 17:18.701
Let's go!

17:18.734 --> 17:20.203
Okay, go, go, go!

17:31.964 --> 17:34.550
Hmm, sweet potato or quinoa?

17:36.147 --> 17:38.148
Noah's menu.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.593
Why don't you feed yourself

17:39.628 --> 17:41.295
before the next wave of orders
coming down?

17:41.329 --> 17:42.863
You've been ripping and running all day.

17:42.898 --> 17:45.900
Exactly why I need to get this done now.

17:48.136 --> 17:49.603
- Dr. Manning?
- Yes.

17:49.638 --> 17:51.144
We think we know
what might have caused this.

17:51.183 --> 17:52.206
Eric.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.574
Myra got sick
while he was staying with her.

17:53.608 --> 17:54.942
We never wanted him around our daughter.

17:54.967 --> 17:55.933
He's a bad influence.

17:55.958 --> 17:57.525
He never applied himself.

17:57.559 --> 17:59.026
He's the opposite of Myra.

17:59.061 --> 18:00.628
No job, hangs out with
a bunch of deadbeats.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.463
We kicked him out because
he was stealing from us.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.532
He takes drugs.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.801
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm not following.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.269
He probably slipped her something.

18:08.303 --> 18:09.804
A drug of some sort.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.172
There's no evidence of that.

18:11.206 --> 18:12.507
Well, are you sure? Because if you knew

18:12.541 --> 18:13.508
what it was...

18:13.542 --> 18:14.675
I understand that

18:14.710 --> 18:16.277
this is a very difficult time,

18:16.311 --> 18:17.979
but the best thing we can do right now

18:18.013 --> 18:19.614
is wait for the MRI to come back,

18:19.648 --> 18:22.116
and I promise,
as soon as we hear anything,

18:22.151 --> 18:24.152
you will be the first to know.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.520
Okay?

18:25.554 --> 18:27.188
All right.

18:29.091 --> 18:30.825
They're blaming Eric for this?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.160
How is this his fault?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.361
They're desperate, looking for answers,

18:33.395 --> 18:34.629
and we don't know the whole story.

18:34.663 --> 18:36.364
Family dynamics can be complicated.

18:36.398 --> 18:37.999
Doesn't matter. It's family.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.801
It's blood. Time like this,

18:39.835 --> 18:41.235
they should be banding together,

18:41.270 --> 18:43.171
not ostracizing one of their own.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.474
I'd expect you to say that.

18:46.508 --> 18:48.142
This again? Really?

18:49.444 --> 18:51.078
Here we go.

18:54.416 --> 18:56.217
You've got a soft spot for family,

18:56.251 --> 18:58.186
sometimes at your own expense.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.520
Planning meals for Noah

18:59.555 --> 19:01.088
when you're slammed at work,
for example.

19:01.123 --> 19:03.157
Helping my brother when he's exhausted.

19:03.192 --> 19:04.892
That's a bad thing in your eyes?

19:06.528 --> 19:09.330
The day I turned 18,
it was sink-or-swim.

19:09.364 --> 19:11.365
Noah's a grown man, April.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.834
You're not doing him any favors

19:12.868 --> 19:15.102
by constantly picking up his slack.

19:15.137 --> 19:16.404
Some point, we've all got to learn

19:16.438 --> 19:18.739
to go it alone.

19:18.774 --> 19:21.375
I'd expect you to say that.

19:33.055 --> 19:34.555
All right, think we're there.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.927
Vacuuming.

19:39.962 --> 19:41.229
Got it.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.233
Ah, blood flow's good.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.567
BP's holding.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.870
Nice job.

19:48.904 --> 19:51.038
Thanks.

19:51.073 --> 19:53.307
Look, I know I have
a tendency to step on toes,

19:53.342 --> 19:54.775
Not personal. I just want to...

19:54.810 --> 19:56.277
Win?

19:59.114 --> 20:01.048
What happened?

20:01.083 --> 20:02.583
Artery ruptured.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.418
Blood is pouring into his chest.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.320
Blood flow was blocked,
and now it's out of control.

20:06.355 --> 20:07.822
All right, help me stent the leak

20:07.856 --> 20:09.156
- before he arrests.
- Where's the rupture?

20:09.191 --> 20:10.958
- Distal LAD.
- Are you kidding?

20:10.993 --> 20:12.393
That's not even where the clot was.

20:12.427 --> 20:13.895
It's an entirely different
section of vessel.

20:15.264 --> 20:17.965
Murphy's Law.

20:27.175 --> 20:28.976
How's he doing?

20:29.011 --> 20:30.444
A few more feet to go,

20:30.479 --> 20:34.081
but no perforations to the bowel.

20:34.116 --> 20:36.117
I was just standing there.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.518
Meanwhile, he was ripping himself open

20:37.552 --> 20:39.153
with a pen? Wait.

20:39.187 --> 20:42.089
The extra Versed.

20:42.124 --> 20:43.958
It completely tranqed him out.

20:43.992 --> 20:47.461
But if I hadn't
given it to him, who knows?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.497
I mean, Alex was intent
on harming himself.

20:49.531 --> 20:51.132
He could have attacked one of us.

20:53.368 --> 20:55.369
What the hell?

20:55.404 --> 20:56.437
There's something embedded

20:56.471 --> 20:58.706
deep in his left gutter,
next to the colon.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.712
What is it?

21:04.746 --> 21:06.547
I have no idea.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.987
Did you see this? Myra's MRI.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.555
Global edema in the brain.

21:14.589 --> 21:16.457
Two hours ago,
there was no sign of swelling.

21:16.491 --> 21:18.626
Echo was clean, too. It's not sepsis.

21:18.660 --> 21:21.829
Or encephalitis, meningitis, HSV, CMV.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.031
We need to brainstorm zebras.

21:24.066 --> 21:26.467
Paraneoplastic syndrome?
Usually presents with a fever,

21:26.501 --> 21:28.469
but there could be cancer cells
in her spinal fluid.

21:28.503 --> 21:30.204
Or another autoimmune, lupus,

21:30.238 --> 21:32.139
sarcoid, some kind of tumor...

21:32.174 --> 21:33.975
What about FilmArray PCR tests?

21:34.009 --> 21:36.344
I'll draw paraneoplastic
and autoimmune panels.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.845
Have a lab put a rush on 'em.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.714
I'll talk to hem-onc,
get bone and PET scans.

21:39.748 --> 21:41.248
Okay.

21:41.283 --> 21:43.217
Myra's mom says
she's been busting her ass

21:43.251 --> 21:44.652
for this fellowship in New Zealand.

21:44.686 --> 21:47.054
She got it.

21:47.089 --> 21:49.090
She's just starting her life.

21:49.124 --> 21:51.993
We keep testing
till we find out what's wrong.

21:52.027 --> 21:53.527
Yeah.

21:57.265 --> 21:58.499
Dr. Halstead,

21:58.533 --> 21:59.767
I've been reviewing the write-up

21:59.801 --> 22:02.036
of our self-surgery patient, Alex.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.270
Not bad, but I think

22:03.305 --> 22:04.672
some small additions to the chart

22:04.706 --> 22:05.673
are in order.

22:05.707 --> 22:07.174
Additions?

22:07.209 --> 22:09.043
Perhaps "elaborations"
is the better word.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.345
Regarding the initial intake, you noted,

22:11.380 --> 22:13.547
"Wound lavaged and closed." I was there.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.417
It was a little more than that.

22:16.451 --> 22:18.452
I think we should say, "We lavaged

22:18.487 --> 22:20.454
"and irrigated with chlorhexidine

22:20.489 --> 22:23.924
and two liters of normal saline," okay?

22:23.959 --> 22:26.227
"Six-inch lacerations
repaired in two layers

22:26.261 --> 22:29.964
"with 60 interrupted 2-0 nylon sutures."

22:29.998 --> 22:31.799
You don't think that's
overdoing it a little bit?

22:31.833 --> 22:34.268
Absolutely not.
This is exactly what we did.

22:34.302 --> 22:35.636
So you'll adjust?

22:35.670 --> 22:37.538
- Yes?
- Yes.

22:37.572 --> 22:39.140
Residence charts, too.

22:39.174 --> 22:40.141
Yes.

22:40.175 --> 22:42.243
Good man.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.715
The art of charting.

22:47.749 --> 22:49.784
The one thing I didn't learn
in residency.

22:49.818 --> 22:52.086
I'll look them over.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.555
Thanks.

22:57.025 --> 22:58.759
I... don't understand.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.062
What are you... what are you saying?

23:01.096 --> 23:02.263
We did what's called

23:02.297 --> 23:03.898
a nuclear blood flow study

23:03.932 --> 23:06.167
and it showed no circulation
to her brain.

23:06.201 --> 23:08.135
Well, there must be
some other test you can run.

23:08.170 --> 23:11.072
They've all been negative.

23:11.106 --> 23:13.007
Something else you can do.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.141
I'm sorry.

23:14.176 --> 23:15.342
There isn't.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.448
We've done everything we can,

23:20.482 --> 23:23.150
but unfortunately,
your daughter is brain-dead.

23:24.453 --> 23:25.753
No...

23:25.787 --> 23:27.288
No...

23:27.322 --> 23:28.923
Okay.

23:28.957 --> 23:30.458
- Our little girl...
- I'm so sorry...

23:30.492 --> 23:31.959
No, no, no, no, no.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.094
She's gonna wake up.
She's gonna be fine.

23:33.128 --> 23:35.162
Myra? Myra...

23:35.197 --> 23:37.098
My baby.

23:37.132 --> 23:38.632
Myra.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.135
She's gone, sweetie.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.304
Your little girl's gone.

23:46.174 --> 23:47.641
We'll give you some time with her.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.709
No...

23:48.743 --> 23:50.644
Our baby...

23:52.547 --> 23:55.216
Oh, baby...

24:07.780 --> 24:09.279
Excuse me.

24:09.313 --> 24:10.947
Mr. Adams.

24:10.981 --> 24:13.582
Our daughter was always
doing things for other people.

24:13.617 --> 24:15.651
She told us if anything
ever happened to her,

24:15.702 --> 24:17.453
she, uh...

24:17.487 --> 24:19.789
wanted to donate her organs.

24:19.823 --> 24:21.123
Of course.

24:21.158 --> 24:23.459
We'll get that started.

24:23.493 --> 24:25.995
We want her life
to have meant something.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.463
We understand.

24:27.497 --> 24:29.331
Thank you.

24:29.366 --> 24:30.800
Of course.

24:30.834 --> 24:34.003
You're high. Look at you!

24:34.037 --> 24:35.337
You're high.

24:35.372 --> 24:38.367
Your sister's dead and you're high!

24:38.909 --> 24:42.258
Wait, Myra's, uh... de...?

24:42.303 --> 24:43.704
She's dead?

24:43.766 --> 24:44.933
Ah...

24:44.967 --> 24:47.035
This is your fault, isn't it?

24:47.069 --> 24:48.536
You did this.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.206
See? I told you he is no good.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.775
He is a drug addict.

24:53.809 --> 24:55.977
What did you give her?

24:56.012 --> 24:57.612
Nothing.

24:57.646 --> 25:00.448
We told you.
Myra's tox screen was negative.

25:00.483 --> 25:03.051
You worthless piece of....

25:03.085 --> 25:04.319
- Oh.
- Whoa.

25:04.353 --> 25:05.487
Get out.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.124
Get out!

25:28.144 --> 25:29.944
He's moving in the wrong direction.

25:29.979 --> 25:31.446
He'll turn around.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.348
Your optimism is enchanting.

25:33.382 --> 25:34.582
Reality, though:

25:34.617 --> 25:35.950
between the clot, then the bleed,

25:35.985 --> 25:37.419
his heart is dying.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.788
We should push for a transplant.

25:39.822 --> 25:41.189
We're only a few hours post-op.

25:41.223 --> 25:43.091
We are miles away from that discussion.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.859
Normally, yes,

25:44.894 --> 25:47.629
but a hit-and-run just died in surgery.

25:47.663 --> 25:49.297
His heart is an HLA match.

25:49.331 --> 25:50.765
You already tested for compatibility?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.300
Ray's not even on the list.

25:52.334 --> 25:54.302
Anything that could go wrong
with Ray has.

25:54.336 --> 25:56.938
We fix one thing, something else breaks.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.640
A heart has fallen into our laps.

25:58.674 --> 26:00.442
Let's use it and steal a win.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.444
Is that our priority?

26:02.478 --> 26:04.145
You want his death on your record?

26:04.180 --> 26:06.214
Dr. Bekker, you may have
elbowed your way

26:06.248 --> 26:09.651
onto Ray's case,
but he's still my patient.

26:09.685 --> 26:11.886
Transplant's not an option.

26:11.921 --> 26:13.488
Then you're just wasting time,

26:13.522 --> 26:16.024
because the balloon pump
he's on won't hold.

26:16.058 --> 26:17.392
He'll max out on pressors

26:17.426 --> 26:19.360
but he'll still need to go on VA-ECMO.

26:19.395 --> 26:20.728
Then it gets invasive:

26:20.763 --> 26:22.163
a procedure for a temporary LVAD.

26:22.198 --> 26:23.631
When that's not enough,

26:23.666 --> 26:25.166
a bigger procedure for a permanent one.

26:25.201 --> 26:27.035
You're going to put Ray
through months of

26:27.069 --> 26:29.137
physical and emotional strain,
only to get back to

26:29.171 --> 26:31.039
exactly where we are right now.

26:31.073 --> 26:33.241
Ray's arteries were bad, not his heart.

26:33.275 --> 26:34.742
Now that the vessels are repaired,

26:34.777 --> 26:37.479
it will compensate
for the clot and the bleed.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.080
It'll heal.

26:39.115 --> 26:41.316
No, it won't.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.750
And when I'm right,

26:42.785 --> 26:45.753
I'll make sure the blame
is on you, not me.

26:49.558 --> 26:52.393
Wow.

26:52.428 --> 26:54.529
I guess there was something

26:54.563 --> 26:57.699
living inside Alex.

26:57.733 --> 26:59.734
I'm still not exactly sure
what I'm looking at.

26:59.768 --> 27:01.536
Is it a tumor?

27:01.570 --> 27:02.904
Possibly.

27:02.938 --> 27:05.874
Or it could be a <i>fetus in fetu:</i>

27:05.908 --> 27:08.776
a twin that her absorbed <i>in utero.</i>

27:08.811 --> 27:10.378
Either way,

27:10.412 --> 27:13.948
it's not a result
of schizophrenia or meth.

27:13.983 --> 27:15.884
How about that?

27:15.918 --> 27:17.418
That's gotta be so rare.

27:17.453 --> 27:19.087
To say the least.

27:19.121 --> 27:21.723
It's very cool.

27:21.757 --> 27:24.459
Hm.

27:24.493 --> 27:26.394
But how did he...

27:26.428 --> 27:28.363
know, not only that there was
something inside him,

27:28.397 --> 27:29.464
but exactly where it was?

27:29.498 --> 27:30.765
Beats me.

27:30.799 --> 27:32.534
And after all the advances we've made,

27:32.568 --> 27:34.936
splicing the genome,
reprogramming viruses,

27:34.970 --> 27:36.538
mapping the brain...

27:36.572 --> 27:38.706
in this case, you know,
just completely trumped

27:38.741 --> 27:40.608
by human instinct.

27:40.643 --> 27:42.310
Everything I've learned
about human nature,

27:42.344 --> 27:45.880
I still can't see things coming.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.883
He scared you?

27:48.918 --> 27:50.485
There's risk in our work.

27:50.519 --> 27:52.287
I guess I realized a long time ago,

27:52.321 --> 27:55.890
you... you choose to see the threat

27:55.925 --> 27:57.892
or the opportunity.

28:18.314 --> 28:20.348
Hey, Eric.

28:20.382 --> 28:22.083
Hey, uh, listen,

28:22.117 --> 28:23.651
the last thing that I need
right now is a lecture.

28:23.686 --> 28:26.721
Hey, I'm here for me
as much as I am for you.

28:29.391 --> 28:31.492
What happened back there...

28:31.527 --> 28:32.860
sometimes, when people are grieving,

28:32.895 --> 28:34.028
they lash out.

28:34.063 --> 28:35.196
Yeah, no, that's...

28:35.231 --> 28:37.498
that's how my folks always are.

28:37.533 --> 28:39.267
Man, they think I'm, uh...

28:39.301 --> 28:43.471
I'm worthless.

28:43.505 --> 28:46.107
I don't know. May... maybe I am,

28:46.141 --> 28:47.675
but they think I want to be like this,

28:47.710 --> 28:51.312
and... and I really don't.

28:51.347 --> 28:52.680
Uh, you know, My-Myra...

28:52.715 --> 28:54.382
she was the only one who ever, like...

28:54.416 --> 28:56.551
like, really, like... like, saw me.

28:56.585 --> 28:58.152
You know?

28:58.187 --> 29:00.188
Yeah.

29:02.391 --> 29:04.959
And now it's...

29:09.732 --> 29:11.899
What do you want, Eric?

29:11.934 --> 29:15.003
I want to get clean.

29:15.037 --> 29:17.372
You know, I wanna, like, wake up

29:17.406 --> 29:18.906
and just feel clear.

29:18.941 --> 29:20.408
Okay.

29:20.442 --> 29:21.576
We'll set you up with a social worker,

29:21.610 --> 29:23.344
get you in a program.

29:23.379 --> 29:26.314
Was... seriously?

29:26.348 --> 29:27.849
Yeah.

29:27.883 --> 29:29.217
You'll get the support you need,

29:29.251 --> 29:31.853
but it's up to you to come through.

29:31.887 --> 29:33.755
Why are you doing this for me?

29:36.392 --> 29:37.892
I guess I'm seeing that
there's a difference

29:37.926 --> 29:40.361
between a crutch and a helping hand.

29:42.798 --> 29:44.098
Thank you.

29:44.133 --> 29:45.867
Yeah.

29:54.910 --> 29:56.344
Let's get you
something to eat first, huh?

29:56.378 --> 29:57.545
Help you come down.

29:57.579 --> 29:59.747
No, no, I had a burger earlier.

29:59.782 --> 30:02.717
Uh, it made me, like, feel really sick.

30:02.751 --> 30:04.886
It's why I... I had to get high.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.421
You know, not to... not to feel it.

30:06.455 --> 30:09.123
Maybe food poisoning?

30:09.158 --> 30:10.458
Uh, no, I just...

30:10.492 --> 30:12.860
I just felt crappy,

30:12.895 --> 30:14.295
like I always do.

30:15.931 --> 30:18.466
Always, or just after eating?

30:26.942 --> 30:28.476
Hey.

30:28.510 --> 30:30.211
Oh, you again.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.913
Yeah, last guy only had a hangnail.

30:31.947 --> 30:33.281
Brought him in anyway.

30:33.315 --> 30:34.749
Okay.

30:34.783 --> 30:36.451
Crew's meeting at Molly's tonight.

30:36.485 --> 30:39.821
Come and hang?

30:39.855 --> 30:41.723
This sudden flirting...

30:41.757 --> 30:42.824
what is it?

30:42.858 --> 30:46.060
Have you seen you?

30:46.095 --> 30:47.128
You're still a catch.

30:47.162 --> 30:49.564
I always have been.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.499
You should've thought about
that before you cheated.

30:51.533 --> 30:54.268
I'm not the same guy anymore.

30:54.303 --> 30:55.937
Hm.

31:00.542 --> 31:01.943
Barry up to something?

31:01.977 --> 31:03.444
I'm not sure.

31:03.479 --> 31:06.147
Yeah, right. This round two?

31:06.181 --> 31:07.482
Too much baggage.

31:07.516 --> 31:08.983
Mm-hmm. Make him work for it.

31:09.017 --> 31:09.984
Mm.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.187
Can I help you with something?

31:13.222 --> 31:14.589
No, I'm just giving today's charts

31:14.623 --> 31:15.957
a once-over.

31:15.991 --> 31:17.692
Ugh, well, you better settle in.

31:17.726 --> 31:19.627
Some of them are a few chapters long.

31:19.661 --> 31:21.763
Stohl's five-minute knee aspiration

31:21.797 --> 31:24.031
reads like "War and Peace."

31:24.066 --> 31:26.100
Hey, Nat, I was speaking with Eric

31:26.135 --> 31:27.535
The drugs... he's self-medicating.

31:27.569 --> 31:28.936
Since he was a kid,

31:28.971 --> 31:31.005
he's gotten sick after eating protein.

31:31.039 --> 31:32.540
Myra was a vegan... avoided protein.

31:32.574 --> 31:34.175
You're thinking that's
what made her sick, too?

31:34.209 --> 31:35.977
Last month, when Myra
was feeling confused,

31:36.011 --> 31:37.712
she was fasting while studying.

31:37.746 --> 31:39.647
Ketosis.

31:39.681 --> 31:41.149
Her body was starving,

31:41.183 --> 31:42.784
so it started digesting muscle as fuel,

31:42.818 --> 31:45.186
which released protein into her blood.

31:45.220 --> 31:47.121
Okay, well, that explains
what made her sick last month,

31:47.156 --> 31:48.122
but what about today?

31:48.157 --> 31:49.891
The fellowship.

31:49.925 --> 31:51.492
She probably wasn't eating again.

31:51.527 --> 31:53.294
I think this is OTC...
a metabolic disorder fits.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.996
You were right.
The visits were connected.

31:55.030 --> 31:56.564
- Yeah.
- Wait.

31:56.598 --> 31:58.800
Did they transplant the liver yet?

31:58.834 --> 32:00.568
It's still up in the OR.
They can't use it.

32:02.538 --> 32:03.871
If Myra had OTC,

32:03.906 --> 32:05.239
she couldn't break down nitrogen.

32:05.274 --> 32:06.507
So it built up in her body as ammonia

32:06.542 --> 32:07.909
and finally put her in a coma.

32:07.943 --> 32:09.343
And if the liver gets transplanted...

32:09.378 --> 32:11.412
Same thing will happen to the recipient.

32:13.248 --> 32:14.482
Is the transplant finished?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.484
No, the last surgery ran late.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.686
They moved the transplant to OR 3.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.588
Come on.

32:25.627 --> 32:27.361
Okay...

32:27.396 --> 32:29.063
- Stop!
- What the hell?

32:29.097 --> 32:30.164
Liver might not be good.

32:30.199 --> 32:31.199
The biopsy was clean.

32:31.233 --> 32:32.400
It's a genetic defect.

32:32.434 --> 32:33.835
It wouldn't show up on the biopsy.

32:33.869 --> 32:34.902
I got my patient wide open, Choi.

32:34.937 --> 32:36.070
You transplant that liver,

32:36.104 --> 32:37.538
he could be dead within hours.

32:37.573 --> 32:38.940
We need time to test the donor's blood,

32:38.974 --> 32:40.942
see if she had OTC.

32:42.277 --> 32:43.845
I'll pack and hold,

32:43.879 --> 32:45.379
but the donor's liver's
only got four hours

32:45.414 --> 32:46.848
till it's shot,

32:46.874 --> 32:48.618
so move it.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.171
A metabolic...

32:56.206 --> 32:58.140
disorder caused her death?

32:58.174 --> 32:59.541
The precise term is

32:59.576 --> 33:01.844
"ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency,"

33:01.878 --> 33:03.979
or OTC.

33:04.013 --> 33:06.982
You see, Myra's liver
was missing a vital enzyme

33:07.016 --> 33:09.485
that helps break down protein.

33:09.519 --> 33:11.487
Something as simple as eating a burger

33:11.521 --> 33:13.122
could cause toxic levels of ammonia

33:13.156 --> 33:15.691
to build up in her blood
and attack her nervous system.

33:15.716 --> 33:17.550
- But Myra was a vegan.
- Yeah.

33:17.594 --> 33:20.729
Which is how she was able to
avoid symptoms for so long,

33:20.771 --> 33:23.399
but when she pushed herself,
and didn't eat...

33:23.433 --> 33:25.134
finals, the fellowship...

33:25.168 --> 33:27.403
her body started breaking down muscle,

33:27.437 --> 33:30.706
which released protein into her blood.

33:30.740 --> 33:32.040
So, you mean,

33:32.075 --> 33:34.710
she'd be alive right now
if she'd just...

33:34.744 --> 33:37.413
eaten?

33:40.183 --> 33:43.318
If this disease is genetic,

33:43.353 --> 33:45.654
that means one of us gave it to her.

33:45.688 --> 33:48.991
Yes, um, it is passed
through the X chromosome,

33:49.025 --> 33:52.428
from mother to child, but...

33:55.904 --> 33:59.140
OTC sufferers exhibit
totally normal liver function.

33:59.191 --> 34:01.960
That's why all of Myra's tests
came back clean.

34:01.994 --> 34:04.662
We were only able to diagnose
her once Eric explained

34:04.697 --> 34:06.965
his lethargy and sickness after eating.

34:06.999 --> 34:09.167
We believe he has the defect as well,

34:09.201 --> 34:12.570
and he's been self-medicating
with drugs.

34:12.605 --> 34:13.905
Wha...?

34:13.938 --> 34:16.574
Oh...

34:16.609 --> 34:18.909
Eric...

34:18.944 --> 34:21.679
is this true?

34:21.714 --> 34:23.581
I'm so sorry.

34:23.616 --> 34:25.949
Oh, son...

34:25.985 --> 34:28.119
Forgive us?

34:28.152 --> 34:30.088
Will you forgive us?

34:30.121 --> 34:33.091
We're so sorry.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.092
Oh, Eric.

34:45.036 --> 34:46.371
So, how's our patient?

34:46.405 --> 34:47.972
Heading for ECMO?

34:48.007 --> 34:49.274
Actually, no.

34:49.308 --> 34:51.509
Uh, BP's risen and is holding,

34:51.543 --> 34:52.710
vitals have stabilized as well,

34:52.745 --> 34:55.980
so I'm going to remove the balloon pump

34:56.014 --> 34:59.250
and give his heart back its full load.

35:00.819 --> 35:03.288
What do you want, an "I was wrong"?

35:03.322 --> 35:05.590
I'm not holding my breath.

35:07.493 --> 35:09.127
Ah, I see our patient

35:09.161 --> 35:10.328
is making a turn for the better.

35:10.362 --> 35:11.796
For a moment, there was concern

35:11.830 --> 35:13.364
the damage was irreparable.

35:13.399 --> 35:14.832
A transplant option presented itself,

35:14.867 --> 35:16.834
but upon discussing
the visual assessment

35:16.869 --> 35:18.670
of the heart during surgery,

35:18.704 --> 35:19.971
the decision was made
to give it more time

35:20.005 --> 35:21.506
to come back on its own.

35:21.540 --> 35:23.074
It was a risk,

35:23.108 --> 35:26.911
but it appears we made the right choice.

35:26.946 --> 35:28.546
Indeed.

35:28.581 --> 35:30.548
Nice work, doctors.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.150
Thank you.

35:35.387 --> 35:38.323
You and Dr. Bekker...

35:38.357 --> 35:40.425
your successes suggest a good pairing,

35:40.459 --> 35:42.427
but your...

35:42.461 --> 35:45.563
exchanges often convey the opposite.

35:45.598 --> 35:49.601
What's peculiar is Dr. Bekker
seems to enjoy this...

35:49.635 --> 35:51.436
discordance.

35:51.470 --> 35:53.671
Do you?

35:56.275 --> 35:58.910
Maybe I do.

36:11.557 --> 36:14.125
You okay?

36:14.159 --> 36:16.961
We turned this hospital
upside-down chasing zebras,

36:16.996 --> 36:18.563
but a simple ammonia test

36:18.597 --> 36:19.964
would've given us
everything we needed to know.

36:19.999 --> 36:22.300
There's no way you could've known.

36:22.334 --> 36:24.102
Silver lining:

36:24.136 --> 36:25.803
the liver transplant was stopped

36:25.838 --> 36:28.573
before it was too late,
and thanks to you,

36:28.607 --> 36:30.575
Eric's getting the help he needs.

36:32.478 --> 36:35.613
I may coddle my family,

36:35.648 --> 36:39.150
but seems I'm not the only one
with a soft spot.

36:50.462 --> 36:52.163
Yes, yes, yes.

36:52.197 --> 36:53.598
Wonderful, Dr. Halstead.

36:53.632 --> 36:54.732
Above and beyond.

36:54.767 --> 36:56.000
Excellent medicine,

36:56.035 --> 36:57.602
and your writing for the ED.

36:57.636 --> 36:59.737
It's been a good day.

37:01.206 --> 37:04.509
We're gonna turn this place around.

37:04.543 --> 37:08.746
He more happy
about the work, or the bill?

37:08.781 --> 37:10.682
So I guess the rumors are true.

37:10.716 --> 37:12.250
This morning's board meeting

37:12.284 --> 37:13.451
was basically an edict

37:13.485 --> 37:15.186
to shake the old money tree?

37:15.220 --> 37:17.588
Ah, nothing that hasn't
come down the pipe before.

37:17.623 --> 37:18.956
I'm handling it.

37:18.991 --> 37:20.358
And these itemized charts

37:20.392 --> 37:21.793
that Stohl's championing?

37:21.827 --> 37:23.995
I mean, detail equals charges, right?

37:24.029 --> 37:26.164
Basically a menu

37:26.198 --> 37:28.766
for Billing to pad the invoices?

37:28.801 --> 37:30.168
Well, I've looked at every chart

37:30.202 --> 37:31.836
coming out of the ED today.

37:31.870 --> 37:33.171
Each one has been accurate

37:33.205 --> 37:34.839
to the services provided.

37:34.873 --> 37:36.708
Well, I should hope
he's not committing fraud.

37:36.742 --> 37:39.444
I mean, the fact that
you even had to check...

37:39.478 --> 37:41.179
Look, Sharon.

37:41.213 --> 37:42.714
You set the tone,

37:42.748 --> 37:44.515
so if you're okay with it,

37:44.550 --> 37:45.717
well, then, it must...

37:45.751 --> 37:47.652
The numbers are clear.

37:47.686 --> 37:49.020
If I don't improve the bottom line,

37:49.054 --> 37:50.888
the board will start slashing.

37:50.923 --> 37:53.725
Do you want to see the ED
closed, or contracted out?

37:53.759 --> 37:55.026
Because that's what'll happen.

37:55.060 --> 37:56.561
No, of course not,

37:56.595 --> 37:57.628
but I also don't wanna see
the bottom line

37:57.663 --> 37:59.530
dictating patient care.

37:59.565 --> 38:01.833
Well, let me tell you something.

38:01.867 --> 38:05.737
Psych is the biggest
money-loser in the ED.

38:05.771 --> 38:07.205
You, Daniel,

38:07.239 --> 38:09.207
are a major part of our problem,

38:09.241 --> 38:12.276
so don't get on the soapbox with me.

38:23.222 --> 38:24.355
You seen Natalie?

38:24.389 --> 38:25.757
She's in the doctor's lounge.

38:25.791 --> 38:27.191
Oh, she told me that you had

38:27.226 --> 38:29.660
a hot date planned tonight.

38:29.695 --> 38:31.229
Uh-huh,

38:31.263 --> 38:32.430
and I'm even gonna shave.

38:32.464 --> 38:33.598
No.

38:33.632 --> 38:35.266
The things we do for love...

38:56.421 --> 38:58.022
Hey.

38:58.056 --> 39:01.025
Day like today... mm.

39:01.059 --> 39:02.894
Tell me about it.

39:02.928 --> 39:05.129
You make a really nice pillow.

39:15.741 --> 39:18.109
Your hot date?

39:20.479 --> 39:21.546
Nice.

39:45.637 --> 39:47.138
Hi.

39:47.172 --> 39:49.607
Dirty Martini.

39:49.641 --> 39:52.510
Extra olives.

39:52.544 --> 39:54.445
You remember the important things.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.515
Wasn't sure you'd show.

39:57.549 --> 39:59.584
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.

39:59.618 --> 40:01.986
You say that you've changed.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.754
We'll see.

40:06.325 --> 40:07.792
Thank you.

40:33.863 --> 40:37.534
April, I'll be there in ten minutes.

40:38.152 --> 40:40.191
Okay.
