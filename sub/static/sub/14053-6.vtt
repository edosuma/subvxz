WEBVTT

00:54.280 --> 00:55.760
WOMAN: Get it!

01:08.560 --> 01:09.920
Yeah!

01:09.960 --> 01:11.600
Yes! Yes!

01:15.240 --> 01:17.360
-Yes! -Yes!

01:19.880 --> 01:23.080
ANNOUNCER: <i>What a thrilling final,</i>

01:19.880 --> 01:23.080
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:23.120 --> 01:26.880
<i>Team Saint-Marie</i> <i>will play Team Isla Jonas</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:31.760
<i>in the finals of the 2015</i> <i>Inter-Island Championships!</i>

01:31.800 --> 01:33.160
<i>So give it up now!</i>

01:34.280 --> 01:35.520
Yes!

01:42.680 --> 01:44.640
Maybe we should be doing something.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.920
Relax! They're training because they're worried.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.000
You were amazing today, girls!

01:52.040 --> 01:53.920
-Yes, we were. -AIDEN: One glass.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.560
The final's in two days and training starts in

01:53.960 --> 01:57.560
the morning, okay?

02:04.480 --> 02:06.360
You want to know how you did?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.680
Does it really matter?

02:08.360 --> 02:09.720
AIDEN: Hey!

02:16.000 --> 02:18.160
MAN: It'll be getting dark soon.

02:19.680 --> 02:24.240
I suggest you get an early night and rest that foot up.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.720
Shells

02:56.000 --> 02:57.360
Shelly?

02:57.400 --> 03:00.280
If you're looking for your partner, she just drove off.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.200
You're welcome.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.880
Woke up with a really bad headache.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.160
Thought I'd run it off. There's water in the bag.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.640
HANK: We'll try out the foot today.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.880
Take off the bandage and see how we get on from there.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.640
It feels better when I walk on it.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.760
Good.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.240
Sorry! Sorry!

03:44.680 --> 03:47.160
Where is she?

03:47.200 --> 03:49.960
There's our Jeep. She can't be far.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.720
I'll go and check.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.520
AIDEN: Okay...

03:58.560 --> 04:00.520
AIDEN: Get on it. You go that side.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.760
That's it, that's it.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.160
Mmm...

05:06.200 --> 05:07.960
Fifteen years of hurt.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.400
Hmm?

05:09.440 --> 05:12.240
It's been 15 years since we were last in the final.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.080
FLORENCE: I didn't know you followed volleyball.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.840
What? I'm a big, big fan!

05:15.880 --> 05:18.000
And what do you like most about it?

05:18.480 --> 05:20.080
Huh? Er...

05:20.120 --> 05:22.040
You know, the... The tactics!

05:22.080 --> 05:24.200
-You know, the...

05:24.240 --> 05:27.160
Getting the ball over the net thing before

05:24.240 --> 05:27.160
it touches the ground.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.720
You know, the jumping up and punching! It's great!

05:27.200 --> 05:30.720
It's a beautiful game!

05:30.760 --> 05:33.840
Hmm. Nothing to do with the skimpy bikinis, then?

05:33.880 --> 05:35.280
Bikinis?

05:35.320 --> 05:37.000
This is a serious game here, you know.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.120
It's been going on for generations!

05:39.160 --> 05:40.440
I was seven.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.200
-Last time we

05:40.480 --> 05:43.200
reached the final.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.680
Seven

05:44.720 --> 05:46.040
How could you have been seven?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.400
How could anybody have been seven 15 years ago?

05:48.440 --> 05:49.720
Well, how old were you?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.120
Er... Erm...

05:51.160 --> 05:53.240
Early 20s... Ish.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.320
HUMPHREY: Morning, all.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.000
-JP: Morning, Chief. -Morning.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.000
It's absolutely heaving out there. I've never

05:56.040 --> 05:58.000
seen so many people.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.280
Everybody's here for the beach volleyball final.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.640
You wouldn't think people would get so excited

06:01.680 --> 06:03.080
about a volleyball match, would you?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.560
Dwayne does.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.480
Seems he's a bit of a tactical expert.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.200
Yet more hidden talents, eh, Dwayne?

06:11.880 --> 06:12.920
Ah...

06:14.080 --> 06:15.680
Ah!  Hot! Hot! Hot!

06:19.200 --> 06:20.800
Who moved my desk? Look, I always lean

06:20.840 --> 06:22.440
back in that chair

06:22.480 --> 06:24.360
and I can usually get a good 15 degrees before...

06:24.400 --> 06:25.880
Wall stoppage.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.240
HUMPHREY: Look, you can see where

06:28.280 --> 06:30.240
the leg marks used to be.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.040
There!

06:33.080 --> 06:34.480
We'll be right there.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.880
What is it?

06:35.920 --> 06:37.640
A body's been found on Turtle Beach.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.200
By the volleyball practice ground!

06:40.120 --> 06:41.680
Shelly Kennedy!

06:42.880 --> 06:44.400
Who?

06:44.440 --> 06:47.280
FLORENCE: She's the star player with Team Isla Jonas.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.040
-Yes.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.480
Isla Jonas are in the final with Saint-Marie.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.640
Mmm-hmm.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.880
She was found by her doubles partner.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.040
No sign of car keys or any other

06:54.920 --> 06:58.040
personal belongings.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.760
Apart from the mobile phone she's holding.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.080
Right.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.080
Erm...

07:08.960 --> 07:10.720
Oh, Lord! Morning, sir!

07:11.360 --> 07:12.920
Morning.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.320
It's Shelly Kennedy? Er, yes,

07:14.360 --> 07:15.720
it would appear so, sir.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.160
I'm sorry.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.120
She was a wonderful young lady.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.200
Her family will be devastated.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.240
-This is Anton Borridge. -Burrage.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.560
Anton Burrage.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.440
Governor-Elect of Isla Jonas...

07:33.440 --> 07:35.440
And close personal friend.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.840
Selwyn informs me you are an outstanding detective.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.320
Oh.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.800
Someone moved my desk.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.880
Erm, I can assure you, sir... Er, sirs,

07:47.920 --> 07:50.800
that we will do everything we can to find out what

07:47.920 --> 07:50.800
happened to Miss Kennedy.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.000
Do we know how she died?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.280
Well, it appears she was stabbed, sir.

07:54.840 --> 07:55.920
Er, may I?

07:55.960 --> 07:58.400
-Of course. -Thank you.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.000
But I would like to be kept informed of any

07:58.440 --> 08:02.000
and all developments.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.280
Yeah. Yes, of course, sir.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.760
Mr... B... Burrage.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.320
FLORENCE: Okay, erm, so the victim's Jeep was seen

08:11.360 --> 08:14.880
driving away from the hotel at around 7:40 a.m. this morning.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.040
Which hotel? Well, it's an old holiday

08:17.080 --> 08:19.200
resort, The Palms,

08:19.240 --> 08:22.480
converted into a kind of sports village for the games.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.760
It's about 6 km away.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.800
So, they saw the Jeep leave, but not the driver?

08:25.840 --> 08:27.560
No.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.480
Okay, Chief, so, this is the practice beach

08:27.600 --> 08:31.480
for all the teams,

08:31.520 --> 08:33.680
but only the finalists are still here.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.760
Saint Marie in the green. Isla Jonas in the blue.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.480
Let's not turn this into a circus.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.320
Get these people back to the resort and we'll

08:37.520 --> 08:39.320
interview them there.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.760
Complete

08:39.360 --> 08:42.760
forensics and the search.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.680
-Let's clear the site as soon as we can.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.680
-Chief!

08:44.720 --> 08:47.520
Oh, and, Dwayne? Call this sports village.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.600
I want the victim's room secured until we get there.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.400
JP?

08:52.440 --> 08:54.800
How many public beaches are there on Saint Marie?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.320
Erm, I'm not sure. 100 maybe?

08:57.360 --> 09:01.520
Hmm. But the body was dumped at the very one

08:57.360 --> 09:01.520
the volleyball teams use,

09:01.560 --> 09:05.040
making it almost certain she was found by someone she knew.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.280
You think she was left here on purpose?

09:07.320 --> 09:10.080
No, I just think it's a bit of a coincidence, don't you?

09:10.120 --> 09:12.040
I hate coincidences.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.000
No, that was really helpful, thank you.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.280
Just send on the full report when you have something.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.120
Stabbed in the heart. Death would have been instant.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.800
And they're estimating the death occurred within

09:27.160 --> 09:30.800
the last three hours.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.560
Which makes it any time after, what, 7:00 a.m.?

09:35.760 --> 09:40.400
17 cm blade. Plastic handle with little

09:35.760 --> 09:40.400
inserts in the handle.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.520
Nothing unique enough to trace a source.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.720
How soon before we can get the phone she was holding?

09:44.760 --> 09:48.160
Oh, they're taking blood and fingerprints,

09:44.760 --> 09:48.160
then they will release it.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.520
I've already asked JP to check with her network,

09:50.560 --> 09:52.800
see what calls were made from it.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.720
-Very thorough, Florence. -Thank you, sir.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.560
Hey, guys, you want the good news or the bad news?

09:58.600 --> 09:59.840
-Bad. -Good.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.400
Well, the good news is

10:01.440 --> 10:03.720
the victim's room was locked and secured

10:01.440 --> 10:03.720
the moment I called in.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.040
-The cleaners had already

10:03.760 --> 10:07.040
been in at 8:00 a.m.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.120
Yup! Clean as a whistle.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.160
I spoke to the cleaners. They said they didn't

10:09.160 --> 10:12.160
notice anything unusual,

10:12.200 --> 10:14.040
except that there was a bed sheet missing.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.920
The victim was wrapped in a bed sheet.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.200
So, despite having a contaminated crime scene,

10:18.240 --> 10:20.280
it seems likely that the victim was killed

10:20.320 --> 10:22.240
in her room and driven to the beach.

10:22.280 --> 10:26.200
So, the killer intended to dispose of the body,

10:22.280 --> 10:26.200
but was disturbed?

10:26.240 --> 10:27.480
Perhaps. Perhaps.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.960
8:00 a.m.?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.880
That's rather early to clean hotel rooms, isn't it?

10:37.920 --> 10:39.680
Aren't people still in bed?

10:45.600 --> 10:49.840
The room was cleaned early at the request of the Isla

10:45.600 --> 10:49.840
Jonas coach, Hank Laymon.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.400
I think we'd better talk to him, don't you?

10:52.440 --> 10:54.680
-Chief.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.440
Very clean.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.360
Let's get a forensic sweep done anyway.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.560
There might be blood traces still here somewhere.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.800
Sir?

11:10.840 --> 11:14.280
So it wasn't robbery. Bag it up anyway.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.280
We'll take it back with us.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.840
That lock is broken.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.560
Short walk to the car park.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.240
The killer killed her, wrapped her in the bed sheet

11:28.280 --> 11:31.600
and carried her through these doors to her Jeep?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.960
They felt they had to move the body.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.760
Think about it.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.400
Why move the body,

11:38.440 --> 11:41.120
carry it outside in broad daylight to

11:38.440 --> 11:41.120
the victim's own car?

11:41.160 --> 11:42.680
Why take that risk?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.920
Unless they had to.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.760
HANK: We had it in the qualifiers

11:45.960 --> 11:48.760
earlier on this year.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.800
Shelly got a stomach bug, knocked her out of the match.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.680
I found a sub, but we only just managed

11:51.840 --> 11:54.680
to scrape through.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.240
So, wherever we stay, I supervise the catering

11:57.280 --> 11:58.640
and make sure the rooms are cleaned

11:58.680 --> 12:01.040
as soon as we leave for the training ground.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.640
-It's easy enough to check. -Oh, we will.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.560
Can you think of anyone who'd want to harm Shelly?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.960
Shelly was our star player. We already had one injury.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.560
Without Shelly, we wouldn't have a chance in the final.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.160
What is that supposed to mean?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.080
HANK: So tell me I'm wrong.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.960
What, you're not seriously suggesting that she was

12:17.120 --> 12:19.960
murdered because of

12:20.000 --> 12:22.680
a beach volleyball match

12:22.720 --> 12:24.920
I'm not suggesting anything.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.080
Just ignore him!

12:27.560 --> 12:28.600
Freak!

12:29.240 --> 12:30.360
HUMPHREY: Mr Parker?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.000
I understand you saw the Jeep leave the resort?

12:34.040 --> 12:37.080
Yes, er, about 7:40.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.560
HUMPHREY: <i>You didn't see the driver?</i>

12:39.400 --> 12:42.120
The driver? But it was Shelly.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.800
We have good reason to think it wasn't.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.560
Was anyone with you when you saw it?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.160
Er... Yeah.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.120
I went to wake Shelly. She wasn't in her room.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.240
I came outside,

12:55.280 --> 12:57.760
he told me that she'd already driven off.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.680
AIDEN: If you're looking for your partner,

12:59.720 --> 13:01.080
she just drove off.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.520
But you didn't actually see the Jeep yourself?

13:04.880 --> 13:05.960
No.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.120
I saw it.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.360
And you are?

13:09.400 --> 13:10.560
Alison Turner.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.200
Saint Marie team captain.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.640
I'd gone out early for a jog, to run off a headache.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.600
It went past me down the beach road.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.040
But you didn't see the driver?

13:20.080 --> 13:21.880
I just recognised the Jeep.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.920
<i>I'd seen her driving it.</i>

13:23.960 --> 13:27.080
<i>I remember thinking</i> <i>Isla Jonas was starting early.</i>

13:27.120 --> 13:30.480
<i>Only, when I got back,</i> <i>I saw the other two</i>

13:27.120 --> 13:30.480
<i>were still here.</i>

13:30.520 --> 13:32.320
HUMPHREY: <i> What time was this?</i>

13:32.360 --> 13:33.960
ALISON: <i> Quarter to eight?</i>

13:34.000 --> 13:35.880
So, if you saw the Jeep leave at 7:40

13:35.920 --> 13:38.200
and you saw it again on the beach road

13:35.920 --> 13:38.200
a few minutes later,

13:38.240 --> 13:41.320
how much longer before you all left the resort?

13:41.360 --> 13:43.480
-No more.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.600
And both teams left the resort at the same time

13:47.640 --> 13:49.280
and arrived at the beach together?

13:49.880 --> 13:51.640
More or less.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.160
So, prior to Mr Parker seeing the Jeep leave,

13:54.200 --> 13:56.040
before 7:40,

13:56.080 --> 13:58.360
can I ask where you all were?

13:58.400 --> 14:01.080
I was having breakfast in my room, er,

14:01.120 --> 14:04.360
then I went for a walk just to get some fresh air.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.600
I woke up just after 7:00 and went for my run.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.920
I was having a shower.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.560
Yes, I woke up, went to find Shelly,

14:14.600 --> 14:17.200
then I went to Dad's room to tell him Shelly had left.

14:17.240 --> 14:20.240
Dad? Oh, yes, of course. You're both Laymon.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.640
I heard Dad in the shower.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.560
Dad, Shelly's already gone down.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.160
We'll have to take your car.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.440
Then I went back to my room to get my bag.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.960
I hadn't slept well.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.600
<i>I didn't get up till</i> <i>just before we left.</i>

14:36.640 --> 14:39.880
HUMPHREY: None of you saw Shelly Kennedy this morning

14:39.920 --> 14:42.000
before you found her body on the beach?

14:46.120 --> 14:47.600
Right.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.240
-I think that someone's lying.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.400
Think about it.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.680
If this was a random killing,

14:55.720 --> 14:57.440
why didn't they take anything from her room,

14:57.480 --> 14:59.120
leave her where she fell, and run?

14:59.160 --> 15:00.920
I think that Shelly knew her killer.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.480
They knew which room she was in, they knew

15:00.960 --> 15:03.480
which car she drove,

15:03.520 --> 15:06.840
and they went to the trouble of moving the body. Why?

15:06.880 --> 15:09.160
No one in there could be our killer.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.760
Because?

15:10.800 --> 15:14.080
Because they couldn't drive the body to

15:10.800 --> 15:14.080
the beach 6 km away

15:14.120 --> 15:16.600
and get back in the space of ten minutes.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.040
They all have a perfect alibi.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.680
Florence, you know what I hate more than a coincidence

15:19.080 --> 15:22.680
in a murder enquiry?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.520
What?

15:24.560 --> 15:26.160
A perfect alibi.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.120
Contents of the victim's room. -Ah!

15:39.160 --> 15:40.440
-Needs to be logged.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.240
-DWAYNE: Yes, Sarge. -Okay!

15:42.280 --> 15:45.960
Thorough checks on all hotel staff, gardeners,

15:42.280 --> 15:45.960
delivery companies,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.480
anyone who had cause to be at the resort this morning.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.480
Background police and financial checks on both teams

15:51.520 --> 15:53.160
-and their support networks. -JP: Yes, sir.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.280
Check the resort CCTV, if they've got any,

15:55.320 --> 15:59.040
and also check the hotels that Team Isla Jonas

15:55.320 --> 15:59.040
have stayed at recently

15:59.080 --> 16:00.520
and check that what Hank Laymon said

16:00.560 --> 16:04.040
about them having their rooms cleaned is true.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.800
Any news on the victim's mobile phone network?

16:06.840 --> 16:07.920
I'll check.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.600
Question. Why do you move a body?

16:12.640 --> 16:14.200
Concealment.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.080
If there is no body, how do you know

16:14.240 --> 16:16.080
there's been a murder?

16:16.120 --> 16:18.080
-HUMPHREY: Good. -To put it somewhere else.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.400
Why?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.040
I have no idea.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.120
Because there's always something on or about

16:21.080 --> 16:24.120
the victim's body

16:24.160 --> 16:26.600
-that will incriminate you. -Excellent!

16:26.640 --> 16:29.240
So which one of those explains why someone would

16:26.640 --> 16:29.240
go to all the trouble

16:29.280 --> 16:33.240
of dumping Shelly Kennedy's body in broad daylight?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.760
Look what I just found stuffed in the pocket

16:35.000 --> 16:38.760
of the victim's purse.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.440
Ah.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.600
Very interesting.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.680
Hank Laymon had just got himself involved in a...

16:55.720 --> 16:58.920
A sports bar chain or something,

16:58.960 --> 17:00.760
and needed to divide his time a bit,

17:00.800 --> 17:05.360
have someone else take over the training of

17:00.800 --> 17:05.360
the girls for a while.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.400
The money was good. I just went there to work.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.720
I never meant for me and her to...

17:11.760 --> 17:14.400
But nobody knows about this, okay? Nobody.

17:14.440 --> 17:18.080
Coach, player... It's against ABV regulations.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.640
-The Association of

17:18.120 --> 17:20.640
Beach Volleyball.

17:20.680 --> 17:25.480
They are heavy on anything that brings

17:20.680 --> 17:25.480
the game into disrepute.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.280
So you were still seeing each other?

17:27.320 --> 17:29.600
No. I ended it and came back to Saint-Marie.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.960
These, these last...

17:35.000 --> 17:38.920
Few weeks have been the hardest of my life.

17:38.960 --> 17:42.960
Seeing her every day and not being able

17:38.960 --> 17:42.960
to speak to her.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.480
So you're telling us that you haven't spent

17:44.520 --> 17:46.160
any time alone together during this competition?

17:46.840 --> 17:48.840
No.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.720
Hank watches her like a hawk. He would have gone ballistic.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.800
He hated us fraternising.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.880
So, he's competitive?

17:54.920 --> 17:56.720
Isn't that the nature of the game?

17:56.760 --> 18:01.440
Honour and sportsmanship is the nature of the game,

17:56.760 --> 18:01.440
Detective.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.640
Not always the nature of those that play it.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.040
Believe me, there is nothing Hank wouldn't do

18:04.680 --> 18:08.040
to win that trophy.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.960
If the...

18:12.800 --> 18:13.800
Go on.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.080
It doesn't matter.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.360
If you knew Shelly so well,

18:22.400 --> 18:24.640
even from a distance, how did she seem to you?

18:27.480 --> 18:29.280
Tired.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.680
AIDEN: <i> Jasmine had hurt</i> <i>her ankle in a football</i>

18:29.320 --> 18:32.680
<i>kickabout on the beach</i>

18:32.720 --> 18:36.800
<i>after the quarterfinals</i> <i>and Shelly had been</i>

18:32.720 --> 18:36.800
<i>carrying her a bit.</i>

18:36.840 --> 18:40.520
<i>I saw her yesterday evening,</i> <i>sitting by the pool.</i>

18:40.560 --> 18:43.960
She looked like she had the weight of the world

18:40.560 --> 18:43.960
on her shoulders.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.440
JP: Can I ask you a question, Dwayne?

18:52.480 --> 18:54.520
Sure, that's what I'm here for.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.880
And you don't have to ask if you can ask.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.840
You need to see me as your guide, yeah?

19:01.520 --> 19:04.720
Your mentor, your first point of contact,

19:04.760 --> 19:06.640
a friend, confidante,

19:06.680 --> 19:09.040
your light at the end of the tunnel. All right?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.600
-Yes. Thank you. -Good.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.360
So ask away now.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.800
Uh, do we have any biscuits?

19:14.840 --> 19:17.680
Tsk. In the cupboard, man!

19:17.720 --> 19:19.160
Yes?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.920
The victim's phone is back,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.960
and it's only her own blood and fingerprints on it,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.960
nothing else.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.680
And the final call made last night was to her parents.

19:26.720 --> 19:32.200
The last text was to Jasmine Laymon at 9:00 p.m.

19:26.720 --> 19:32.200
last night and it reads...

19:32.240 --> 19:34.440
"Sorry. Made an appointment for tomorrow afternoon."

19:34.480 --> 19:35.960
An appointment for what?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.400
That's all there was. But there is something else.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.760
JP went through her apps,

19:39.800 --> 19:41.360
and there's a voice memo recorder.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.000
-There's only one file...

19:44.760 --> 19:46.160
And it has today's date.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.040
So, it had to be recorded this morning?

19:48.080 --> 19:50.760
-Yes, I'd say so, sir. -Please tell me

19:48.080 --> 19:50.760
there's a time.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.800
JP: Sorry.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.760
-That is weird. -How extraordinary.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.000
Her breathing, it feels strained.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.880
You think it's after she's been stabbed?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.160
HUMPHREY: Yes, possibly.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.880
But without a time, we can't be sure what it is.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.800
And why would anyone record their own breathing? Right.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.600
Everyone who we know she had any kind of relationship

20:14.840 --> 20:18.600
with has a perfect alibi.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.480
So are we missing something

20:21.520 --> 20:23.880
Two of the cleaners confirm seeing Jasmine Laymon

20:23.920 --> 20:26.160
knock on the victim's door around 7:40.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.040
<i>But everyone at</i> <i>the resort has been there</i>

20:26.200 --> 20:29.040
<i>for at least a year.</i>

20:29.080 --> 20:30.440
None with any criminal records

20:30.480 --> 20:32.800
and we can't find anyone with links to the victim.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.720
So, if she made an appointment,

20:35.760 --> 20:37.680
then the chances are she did it with her phone.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.280
Run all the numbers she called yesterday before 9:00 p.m.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.000
Call them all and see if she made an appointment

20:40.320 --> 20:43.000
with any of them

20:43.040 --> 20:45.160
and, if so, what it was all about.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.240
Yes, Chief.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.960
They won't find out anything.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.640
I spoke to the guy in charge of the

20:53.000 --> 20:55.640
investigation this morning.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.840
He's an idiot!

20:56.880 --> 20:58.600
Look, just hold your nerve.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.080
Uh-huh!

21:01.120 --> 21:03.680
Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. Uh-huh.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.040
Confirm arrangements. All right.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.840
HUMPHREY: I can clearly see it's moved!

21:15.880 --> 21:17.760
There!

21:18.320 --> 21:19.880
Yes, JP?

21:19.920 --> 21:22.280
Er, I ran a check on all the hotels that

21:19.920 --> 21:22.280
the Isla Jonas team

21:22.320 --> 21:24.920
stayed at in the past three months, six in all.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.040
They all said that Coach Laymon insisted on

21:24.960 --> 21:28.040
inspecting the kitchens

21:28.080 --> 21:31.240
and that he had the rooms cleaned every morning as soon

21:28.080 --> 21:31.240
as they left for training.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.840
All right, thank you, JP.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.760
Thank you. Chief?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.280
Yes, Dwayne?

21:36.320 --> 21:38.880
One of the victim's calls was made to the ABV at 6:00 p.m.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.960
The Association of Beach Volleyball?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.680
Hey, well done, Chief, huh?

21:46.480 --> 21:47.560
Ah?

21:47.600 --> 21:49.960
Yes, well, I'm not completely ignorant

21:50.000 --> 21:52.240
when it comes to international sports, you know?

21:54.200 --> 21:57.600
Anyway, I spoke to the secretary at the ABV,

21:54.200 --> 21:57.600
a very nice lady,

21:57.640 --> 21:59.360
and Shelly Kennedy had made an appointment to speak

21:59.400 --> 22:01.000
to the head of regulatory compliance.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.720
Now, why do you arrange a meeting with

22:01.040 --> 22:04.720
regulatory compliance?

22:04.760 --> 22:06.720
To report somebody

22:06.760 --> 22:10.000
Yet again, all fingers point to the volleyball squads.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.080
FLORENCE: The people with perfect alibis.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.760
Right, we'll go and talk to Jasmine Laymon about this,

22:12.120 --> 22:15.760
er, mystery appointment.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.920
In the meantime, you and JP look into

22:17.960 --> 22:21.080
whether it's possible to get to the beach and back

22:17.960 --> 22:21.080
in 10 minutes.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.960
See if you can't make it a little bit,

22:21.120 --> 22:24.960
er, less impossible.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
No problem, Chief.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.840
Any joy with the CCTV at the sports village?

22:29.880 --> 22:32.160
The only camera that does work only covers the main gate.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.520
I'm picking up the tape in one hour.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.840
Well done, Dwayne.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.640
-Thank you, Chief. -Florence!

22:37.200 --> 22:38.360
DWAYNE: Sarge.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.080
Right, so where do we start?

22:45.680 --> 22:48.400
Lost property box.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.600
HUMPHREY: People seem to be taking this volleyball

22:48.440 --> 22:51.600
competition very seriously.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.880
FLORENCE: That's because we're playing Isla Jonas.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.320
It goes back generations.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.440
You were born here, you hate them.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.360
You're born there, you hate us.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.040
Like, it's part of the culture.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.440
Right, it's, er, like the North

23:03.480 --> 23:05.280
The what?

23:05.320 --> 23:08.280
Oh, well, back in England, there's this sort

23:05.320 --> 23:08.280
of ingrained rivalry

23:08.320 --> 23:11.440
between people from the North and people from the South.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.840
-Yes, but, erm...

23:13.880 --> 23:15.160
There's still a lot of differences

23:15.200 --> 23:17.040
depending on which side of the line you're from.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.320
Such as?

23:18.360 --> 23:20.680
Well, people from the North are all like, er...

23:20.720 --> 23:24.440
"Ey up! Whippet's sick,

23:20.720 --> 23:24.440
pass us barm cake!"

23:24.480 --> 23:26.280
-Whereas people from

23:24.480 --> 23:26.280
the South are more like,

23:26.320 --> 23:28.680
"Do you what? Leave it out!

23:26.320 --> 23:28.680
You're 'aving a larf?"

23:28.720 --> 23:30.000
Or words to that effect.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.080
I have no idea what you just said!

23:32.120 --> 23:35.080
HUMPHREY: I know. Imagine how people in

23:32.120 --> 23:35.080
the Midlands must feel.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.560
FLORENCE: The what

23:36.600 --> 23:38.000
Oh, right. What?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.400
HANK: No.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.040
But you didn't agree with her contacting the ABV?

23:47.080 --> 23:50.320
Look, I was trying to convince her not to get involved,

23:50.360 --> 23:52.200
to just leave things alone.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.320
What exactly did she want to talk to them about?

23:55.640 --> 23:57.480
This.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.400
I thought you sustained that injury kicking a football

23:57.520 --> 24:00.400
about on the beach?

24:00.440 --> 24:01.560
I did.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.080
But that's not what Shelly thought.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.320
She thought it had been done on purpose.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.240
FLORENCE: The text she sent you last night

24:08.280 --> 24:12.200
also said she was sorry. An apologetic text.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.400
Like perhaps you were the one she was planning

24:12.240 --> 24:15.400
on complaining about?

24:20.920 --> 24:22.400
Alison Turner.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.720
<i>Shelly thought</i> <i>it was deliberate.</i>

24:27.760 --> 24:31.960
<i>She wanted me to put</i> <i>in a complaint myself,</i>

24:27.760 --> 24:31.960
<i>but I said no.</i>

24:32.000 --> 24:33.440
<i>She wouldn't let it go.</i>

24:33.480 --> 24:36.240
<i>We spent days</i> <i>arguing about it.</i>

24:37.640 --> 24:39.400
I didn't want to tell you.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.320
I just knew you'd...

24:43.600 --> 24:45.400
I tried to talk her out of it!

24:45.440 --> 24:46.880
You see, I don't understand. If Alison injured

24:46.920 --> 24:48.360
you on purpose,

24:48.400 --> 24:50.240
why wouldn't you want to report it?

24:50.280 --> 24:54.920
Because it doesn't matter whether it was done on

24:50.280 --> 24:54.920
purpose or not.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.960
A good player needs to be on their guard

24:54.960 --> 24:57.960
for this sort of thing.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.840
And Jasmine wasn't.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.960
The mistake is hers.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.760
Now... Are we done here?

25:10.480 --> 25:12.520
Not the easiest people to warm to, are they?

25:12.560 --> 25:14.440
And I don't even have your prejudices.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.200
Except against the South.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.040
North! I'm from the South!

25:24.400 --> 25:26.040
FLORENCE: What's he wearing?

25:26.080 --> 25:28.480
Dwayne, when I said look into the timings,

25:26.080 --> 25:28.480
I didn't mean, er...

25:29.520 --> 25:32.320
-Good work, JP. -Ah, Chief!

25:32.360 --> 25:35.080
I have the camera footage from the main gate.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.520
Anything?

25:36.560 --> 25:38.880
Okay, so this is the only way in or out of the resort.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.200
At 7:39, the Jeep leaves, like everyone said.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.280
But at this angle, we can't see who's driving.

25:44.320 --> 25:49.720
Then no one goes in, no one goes out until

25:44.320 --> 25:49.720
10 minutes later, at 7:51.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.120
Fast forward...

25:52.160 --> 25:54.600
Out comes the car with Hank and Jasmine Laymon

25:54.640 --> 25:56.800
followed by the people carrier with the Saint-Marie team

25:56.840 --> 25:59.840
and that's it. We did try to find a short cut on foot,

25:59.880 --> 26:02.440
but there's absolutely no way you could get

25:59.880 --> 26:02.440
there any quicker.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.360
-Even Usain Bolt couldn't do it.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.360
-FLORENCE: Then it's clear.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.440
None of these five could have killed Shelly Kennedy.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.440
Team?

26:09.480 --> 26:10.920
-DWAYNE: Commissioner. -Sir.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.040
Er, I'll just go and, er...

26:15.680 --> 26:16.720
Yes.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.200
Progress?

26:22.240 --> 26:24.440
Er, not very much, I'm afraid, sir.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.920
We're finding it quite hard to get any

26:24.480 --> 26:27.920
traction on this one.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.280
I see.

26:31.040 --> 26:34.600
-Er... Not exactly.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.840
I wish I could have more that you could

26:34.640 --> 26:37.840
pass on to your friend,

26:37.880 --> 26:40.280
er, Mr... Burrage.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.320
Detective Inspector,

26:43.360 --> 26:47.920
when I earlier introduced Governor-Elect Borridge

26:47.960 --> 26:50.160
as a "close personal friend,"

26:50.200 --> 26:54.640
I believe that is what you would refer to as a white lie.

26:54.680 --> 26:59.520
Anton Borridge and I have been many things over the years,

26:59.560 --> 27:02.840
but friends is not one of them.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.680
I see.

27:04.720 --> 27:08.280
He is an odious little toad,

27:08.320 --> 27:12.880
but protocol demands that I make him feel welcome.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.840
-Perfectly, sir.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.920
Excellent!

27:17.960 --> 27:22.800
Then I look forward to hearing of exciting

27:17.960 --> 27:22.800
developments very soon.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.280
-Team. -Sir!

27:26.040 --> 27:27.800
BOTH: Commissioner.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.280
Wait! We do have a suspect.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.160
-Alison Turner.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.520
She said she was out jogging.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.280
So, how come we didn't see her coming back

27:36.560 --> 27:39.280
on that camera footage?

27:39.320 --> 27:40.640
And she said she saw the Jeep.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.280
Plus, she was also the person we now know

27:43.320 --> 27:46.600
that the victim was about to report to the ABV.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.840
ALISON: <i> Hang on.</i>

27:56.880 --> 27:59.280
You're not seriously...

27:59.320 --> 28:02.480
I had no problem with Shelly Kennedy,

28:02.520 --> 28:06.440
and if she had one with me, it's the first

28:02.520 --> 28:06.440
I'm hearing of it.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.880
It was an accident! Everyone could see that!

28:08.920 --> 28:10.240
Shelly thought otherwise.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.360
Then why didn't she say anything to me about it?

28:12.400 --> 28:13.840
You tell us.

28:13.880 --> 28:18.160
She was really going to report her to the ABV

28:18.200 --> 28:22.720
Look, there was no love lost between us,

28:18.200 --> 28:22.720
I'm not denying that.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.960
But me and Maz have had to work to get where we are.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.800
We did not have the Laymons' money,

28:27.840 --> 28:30.840
home gyms and private trainers.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.520
Maz is trying to support her whole family

28:32.560 --> 28:36.080
from what we earn on the circuit.

28:36.120 --> 28:41.280
But out the lot of them, Shelly is the only one

28:36.120 --> 28:41.280
I had time for.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.320
If anything, I always felt a bit sorry for her,

28:44.360 --> 28:46.040
stuck with them two.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.840
HUMPHREY: Why do you say that?

28:47.880 --> 28:51.560
He's a cold son of a bitch, I'll tell you that much.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.560
When you told us to go back to the resort,

28:53.600 --> 28:55.440
they came back with us,

28:55.480 --> 28:58.560
but Aiden was so shook up he couldn't drive,

28:58.600 --> 29:00.760
so Hank drove instead.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.640
<i>We'd only</i> <i>just left the beach.</i>

29:03.680 --> 29:06.960
<i>Nobody was talking,</i> <i>we were just all in shock.</i>

29:07.000 --> 29:09.280
<i>Couldn't believe it.</i>

29:09.320 --> 29:11.720
<i>Jasmine had been</i> <i>the first one</i>

29:09.320 --> 29:11.720
<i>to see the body,</i>

29:11.760 --> 29:14.040
<i>but I don't think it</i> <i>really hit her until then.</i>

29:16.400 --> 29:17.760
Pull over!

29:24.120 --> 29:26.480
<i>He couldn't even look at her.</i>

29:26.520 --> 29:30.320
<i>Like he was ashamed</i> <i>that she was showing</i>

29:26.520 --> 29:30.320
<i>any kind of weakness,</i>

29:30.360 --> 29:32.240
<i>any kind of emotion.</i>

29:33.440 --> 29:36.040
He gives me the creeps.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.400
Anyway, I'm the one that saw the killer leaving.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.400
Remember?

29:39.440 --> 29:44.360
Er, yes. Your jog. We checked the footage

29:39.440 --> 29:44.360
of the CCTV at the entrance.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.840
We never saw you.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.680
Because I don't come back through the main entrance!

29:48.720 --> 29:51.800
I run the perimeter footpath, come back

29:48.720 --> 29:51.800
through the chalets.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.760
Look, whatever you think, I didn't hurt

29:53.800 --> 29:55.720
Jasmine on purpose

29:55.760 --> 29:58.720
and I certainly didn't kill anybody to cover it up.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.040
Thank you.

30:07.080 --> 30:11.320
Nope! Still don't get it. Why did the killer

30:07.080 --> 30:11.320
move the body?

30:11.360 --> 30:14.400
And if it being at the same beach

30:11.360 --> 30:14.400
the teams use for practice

30:14.440 --> 30:15.720
wasn't a coincidence,

30:15.760 --> 30:18.680
then why take it there knowing they'd be disturbed?

30:18.720 --> 30:22.000
Then everything points to the killer being

30:18.720 --> 30:22.000
someone who knew Shelly,

30:22.040 --> 30:25.080
yet the people who know her all have a cast-iron alibi.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.840
Is that why the body was left there?

30:27.880 --> 30:30.240
To provide the alibi in the first place,

30:30.280 --> 30:32.080
some kind of weird double bluff?

30:32.120 --> 30:34.840
But even then, how did they get there and back

30:32.120 --> 30:34.840
in the time?

30:34.880 --> 30:37.680
Chief? Just got the forensics back from the victim's room.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.320
They used Luminol, the works,

30:39.360 --> 30:42.240
but they couldn't find a single trace of blood

30:39.360 --> 30:42.240
in the whole place.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.640
Plenty of bleach. But no blood.

30:44.680 --> 30:47.480
It's as if the killer knew the room would be cleaned.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.680
Hank Laymon asked for it to be cleaned.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.800
Yes, but he did that wherever they stayed, so everyone else

30:49.720 --> 30:52.800
would know that too.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.760
It's been a long day. Maybe we should take a break

31:01.800 --> 31:04.200
and clear our heads. Come at things fresh tomorrow.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.600
Yes, Okay.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.640
-I'll buy the first beer. -Yes, Okay.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.280
HUMPHREY: <i> Magpies. Gunners.</i>

31:21.960 --> 31:25.960
Corrie. Enders. Erm...

31:26.000 --> 31:28.360
Blur. Oasis.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.520
-I don't know.

31:31.560 --> 31:34.120
Now ask him to explain the Middle-lands.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.600
-Midlands! -Midlands.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.120
But it doesn't make any sense, Chief!

31:38.160 --> 31:40.440
You, you all live on the same island!

31:42.520 --> 31:46.480
-Oh, fine, fine. Keeping busy.

31:46.520 --> 31:50.640
Yes, er, cooking for one does take some getting

31:46.520 --> 31:50.640
used to, doesn't it?

31:50.680 --> 31:53.400
Ah, what's that silly English expression?

31:53.440 --> 31:55.360
Two birds and one stone?

31:55.400 --> 31:58.520
-Two birds with one stone. -Exactly!

31:58.560 --> 32:01.000
We should dine together from time to time.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.880
I hate to see my lovely trecho curry going to waste.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.560
I'm always making far too much.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.680
-DWAYNE: Yup.

32:09.720 --> 32:15.360
Goat meat, copra, boniato and burning hot

32:09.720 --> 32:15.360
habanero peppers.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.240
Spontaneous combustion in a bowl.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.680
Let me know when you're ready.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.240
Okay.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.800
Is it really that hot?

32:25.840 --> 32:28.040
The locals will only eat it in the winter,

32:28.080 --> 32:31.000
when it's really, really cold, below 25 degrees.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.240
FLORENCE: Why didn't JP join us?

32:33.280 --> 32:36.080
Oh, he said he's got himself a date.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.840
Which is not surprising, really.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.040
I think he's trying to mould himself in my image.

32:42.120 --> 32:46.720
Congratulations! You have successfully created

32:42.120 --> 32:46.720
competition for yourself.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.520
Much younger competition.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.240
I didn't think of that, you know.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.680
What can I say?

32:53.720 --> 32:58.200
We all create our own Frankensteins, Dwayne.

32:53.720 --> 32:58.200
Cheers.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.720
-Cheers. -Cheers!

33:02.240 --> 33:07.960
Yes, erm, well, erm, like you said, need to sleep,

33:02.240 --> 33:07.960
fresh start in the morning.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.440
Clear head and all that. Night-night.

33:10.480 --> 33:13.840
You're going back to the station, aren't you?

33:13.880 --> 33:15.160
No.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.080
Oh, and by the way. Frankenstein was the creator,

33:18.680 --> 33:22.080
not the monster. Night-night.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.880
Guess that makes you the Frankenstein, then.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.880
JP?

33:54.920 --> 33:58.800
Well, I had a place lined up when I first came out of

33:54.920 --> 33:58.800
training, but it fell through.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.720
And I found somewhere else, sir, but it needs a deposit

34:00.760 --> 34:03.200
and, with my family being on the other end of the island...

34:03.240 --> 34:06.920
-Until I get my

34:03.240 --> 34:06.920
first pay slip, yes.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.760
-You were the one who moved my desk!

34:08.360 --> 34:10.760
-Well, sir, I...

34:10.800 --> 34:14.640
I brought the portable telly through to... To watch.

34:14.680 --> 34:15.880
I'm sorry.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.200
Am I fired?

34:18.240 --> 34:19.920
Fired

34:22.000 --> 34:26.040
At least that's one mystery solved now. There were

34:22.000 --> 34:26.040
too many banging around. No!

34:26.080 --> 34:28.080
Now I get to go through this with a clearer head.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.800
And you can help me.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.960
That is, er, unless there's somewhere else you need to be?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.120
Er, no! Good!

34:47.120 --> 34:49.760
-I don't know.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.640
But if the Chief was worried about his desk

34:49.800 --> 34:52.640
moving two inches,

34:52.680 --> 34:54.840
I don't know what he's going to

34:52.680 --> 34:54.840
make of this.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.640
Homeless

35:12.680 --> 35:14.520
He's not homeless, he just doesn't have a house.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.400
So you didn't really have a date, then?

35:16.440 --> 35:18.280
When would I have had the time?

35:18.320 --> 35:20.520
JP, you've got to make time!

35:20.560 --> 35:23.240
Boy, there's still so much I've got to teach you!

35:23.280 --> 35:24.720
Right, that's it!

35:24.760 --> 35:26.800
This weekend, me and you are hitting the clubs. You hear?

35:26.840 --> 35:30.960
Right, well, leaving JP's housing and love-life

35:26.840 --> 35:30.960
situation aside for a moment,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.080
there is something we need to show you.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.720
We spent last night watching some of the previous games in

35:33.120 --> 35:36.720
the contest.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.520
We actually just wanted to see the footage of Shelly's play,

35:39.560 --> 35:40.920
but once we started watching,

35:40.960 --> 35:42.680
-we couldn't stop. -I'll bet!

35:42.720 --> 35:44.360
Ahem, yeah.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.560
And that's when we noticed something.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.680
As good as the Isla Jonas team were,

35:48.720 --> 35:50.920
there's only so much in the match you can control.

35:50.960 --> 35:53.600
Despite everything, there were games, like this one,

35:50.960 --> 35:53.600
where Isla Jonas

35:53.640 --> 35:56.640
are down to the closing minutes of the game,

35:53.640 --> 35:56.640
but still need

35:56.680 --> 35:59.920
to get one last point to win, which is when this happens...

36:01.320 --> 36:03.280
FLORENCE: It looks like she let it drop.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.720
Giving Isla Jonas the two-point lead

36:03.320 --> 36:06.720
they needed to win the game.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.400
-So nothing,

36:06.760 --> 36:09.400
if this was a one-off.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.880
Most of the time, Isla Jonas breezed it. But any time

36:09.440 --> 36:12.880
they didn't, a double fault,

36:12.920 --> 36:14.560
a dropped ball, bad return, you name it,

36:14.600 --> 36:16.720
and always when Isla Jonas are behind.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.640
-Yes!

36:19.680 --> 36:22.800
Here's another one where their opponents seem to

36:19.680 --> 36:22.800
let the ball drop.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.600
Wait! On that one! Go back.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.920
She isn't in on it!

36:33.960 --> 36:37.040
No, but from the look on her face,

36:33.960 --> 36:37.040
she's starting to suspect.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.920
JP: That match was three weeks ago.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.800
So, three weeks after Shelly Kennedy

36:38.960 --> 36:41.800
started to suspect

36:41.840 --> 36:44.520
that some of Isla Jonas' matches may be fixed,

36:41.840 --> 36:44.520
she was murdered.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.840
That is a coincidence I'm not prepared to accept.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.840
-So we have a motive. -There's something else.

36:48.880 --> 36:52.520
An appointment to go and see the ABV.

36:52.560 --> 36:56.040
Was it to report Alison Turner,

36:52.560 --> 36:56.040
as she told Jasmine Laymon,

36:56.080 --> 36:57.520
or was it something more serious?

36:57.560 --> 36:59.640
Making an allegation of match-fixing

36:59.680 --> 37:02.480
just before the Inter-Island Final would wreak havoc.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.880
JP, I want bank records from anyone connected

37:02.520 --> 37:05.880
to the Isla Jonas team.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.600
We're looking for substantial chunks of money

37:07.640 --> 37:10.160
going in or coming out of accounts on the days

37:07.640 --> 37:10.160
of the matches.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.760
-Yes, sir. -Dwayne...

37:11.800 --> 37:13.440
-Yes, Chief! -Whoever it is

37:13.480 --> 37:15.160
won't be match-fixing for glory.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.800
Luckily, I know most of the bookmakers on the island.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.600
I thought you might. Let me know if you've

37:17.840 --> 37:20.600
got anything.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.760
Florence and I will head to the resort. I've got a hunch

37:23.800 --> 37:26.280
that someone else knew about this.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.280
Come on, Florence!

37:28.920 --> 37:30.280
AIDEN: How did you find out?

37:30.320 --> 37:32.080
HUMPHREY: Probably the same way you did.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.720
-Watching the matches back-to-back.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.720
-Ah.

37:35.760 --> 37:39.680
Yesterday, you wanted to tell us something,

37:35.760 --> 37:39.680
didn't you?

37:39.720 --> 37:43.200
Believe me, there is nothing Hank wouldn't do

37:39.720 --> 37:43.200
to win that trophy.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.240
Go on.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.600
That was what you were going to tell us, wasn't it?

37:51.400 --> 37:53.320
FLORENCE: Match-fixing is serious.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.400
Why didn't you report it?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.840
Report what

37:57.880 --> 38:01.600
In this profession, cheating is like...

38:01.640 --> 38:05.320
It's the dirtiest word you could say. I...

38:01.640 --> 38:05.320
I couldn't prove anything.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.360
Did you ever discuss it with anyone else?

38:09.400 --> 38:11.120
Yeah, he told us.

38:11.160 --> 38:14.320
And do you know what? I would have

38:11.160 --> 38:14.320
loved to have believed it.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.600
But no, whatever I might think of them,

38:18.640 --> 38:20.800
those girls could play.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.520
They wouldn't cheat.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.120
That's a nice ring.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.320
You know, when I was younger, if ever I was nervous,

38:30.360 --> 38:35.400
or trying to hide something, I'd do this with my hair.

38:35.440 --> 38:39.200
You do a similar thing with that.

38:35.440 --> 38:39.200
I noticed it yesterday.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.520
This is a murder enquiry.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.600
Do you understand what that means?

38:48.600 --> 38:51.000
So is there something you'd like to tell us?

38:55.400 --> 38:58.320
I'm so, so sorry.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.680
I was offered money to throw the final.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.320
But I didn't take it, Alison.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.320
I swear to you, I didn't take it.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.600
Who offered you money?

39:11.960 --> 39:13.480
I... I don't know.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.200
<i>It was just moments</i> <i>after we qualified.</i>

39:18.360 --> 39:19.680
Hello?

39:20.560 --> 39:22.280
Who is this?

39:22.320 --> 39:25.520
He offered me $10,000.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.640
Told me to think about it, told me he'd call me later.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.520
He?

39:32.560 --> 39:37.240
Well, I, I think it was a man, but... I don't know.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.080
Whoever it was, they were disguising

39:37.280 --> 39:40.080
their voice.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.960
Why didn't you tell me?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.760
Because you were going to take the money,

39:44.800 --> 39:47.360
-It wasn't for me!

39:48.880 --> 39:50.760
It was for Mum.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.160
She can't keep up the payments on her house.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.960
Even with what I make playing, it's not enough.

39:59.040 --> 40:03.000
<i>I spent all day</i> <i>thinking about it,</i>

39:59.040 --> 40:03.000
<i>going back and forth.</i>

40:03.040 --> 40:04.520
<i>The difference</i> <i>it would make...</i>

40:06.160 --> 40:08.200
<i>I could change her life...</i>

40:08.240 --> 40:12.560
<i>For a stupid volleyball game.</i>

40:12.600 --> 40:15.960
<i>I wasn't sure whether</i> <i>I was going to go through</i>

40:12.600 --> 40:15.960
<i>with it or not.</i>

40:16.880 --> 40:18.880
<i>Not until that moment.</i>

40:23.960 --> 40:26.480
I was so close to picking it up...

40:29.360 --> 40:31.600
But you didn't.

40:31.640 --> 40:32.760
And that's all that matters.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.000
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask for that phone.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.680
Thank you.

40:54.440 --> 40:58.000
JP, there's a number called this phone two days ago

40:54.440 --> 40:58.000
at 4.30

40:58.040 --> 41:01.320
and again the same evening. It was from our

40:58.040 --> 41:01.320
mystery match-fixer.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.120
-See if you can't put a name to it.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.120
-Yes, Chief.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.720
-Oh, and about those bank records, sir...

41:03.160 --> 41:05.720
-Okay, Chief!

41:05.760 --> 41:07.360
I had to call in a lot of favours,

41:07.400 --> 41:09.800
but I found a big-time, under-the-counter bookmaker

41:09.840 --> 41:11.760
who's admitted having dealings with Hank Laymon.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.640
-Yup. Two days ago,

41:13.680 --> 41:15.520
he placed a considerable bet on Isla Jonas for the final.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.320
JP, do we have bank records to back that up?

41:17.360 --> 41:20.480
That's the thing, sir. Hank Laymon was

41:17.360 --> 41:20.480
declared bankrupt.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.760
But the Laymons are one of the richest families

41:20.520 --> 41:23.760
on Isla Jonas.

41:23.800 --> 41:27.000
JP: Well, that's up until 18 months ago.

41:23.800 --> 41:27.000
I checked it out.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.360
A failed business venture, looks like a chain

41:27.040 --> 41:30.360
of sports bars, sir.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.720
The bars Aiden Parker told us about.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.480
They went into administration 18 months ago.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.440
-Well, one. A week ago, he cleared out an old

41:37.480 --> 41:40.400
savings account. $12,000, sir.

41:40.440 --> 41:43.640
-Looks like that's all he had. -But my guy said it was

41:40.440 --> 41:43.640
a $15,000 bet.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.360
So, he managed to scratch a bit more from somewhere.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.160
So it seems clear

41:48.200 --> 41:51.440
that Hank Laymon was somehow involved in this match-fixing

41:51.480 --> 41:53.840
and that Shelly Kennedy had somehow discovered that.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.520
But what is also clear is that he couldn't have done it

41:58.480 --> 42:01.440
Because if he used every penny he had to bet

41:58.480 --> 42:01.440
on Isla Jonas in the final,

42:01.480 --> 42:04.200
then who was going to pay Maz Shipley

42:01.480 --> 42:04.200
to throw her match?

42:04.240 --> 42:06.360
-My guess is

42:06.400 --> 42:08.960
this partner was the one who made

42:06.400 --> 42:08.960
the phone call to Maz.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.600
JP, any luck with that number?

42:10.640 --> 42:12.480
No, sir. It's coming up as unregistered.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.120
Now, why does that not surprise me?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.840
But it has to be someone who was close to Hank Laymon.

42:16.880 --> 42:20.080
Sir, the SIM was sold in Isla Jonas,

42:16.880 --> 42:20.080
if that helps.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.840
That just confirms what we know.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.840
It has to be somewhere else.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.360
Okay, Chief, I'm going to say something,

42:27.400 --> 42:29.480
just because it popped into my head, mind you.

42:29.520 --> 42:32.320
There's only one other person who wanted Islas Jonas to win

42:32.360 --> 42:34.400
-more than Hank Laymon did. -Go on.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.000
The governor guy who came with the team, Barrage,

42:34.440 --> 42:37.000
or whatever his name is.

42:37.040 --> 42:40.440
The Commissioner called him a toad, right?

42:37.040 --> 42:40.440
And he looks loaded to me!

42:40.480 --> 42:43.920
And from what I've heard, he would do anything

42:40.480 --> 42:43.920
to see Isla Jonas

42:43.960 --> 42:46.920
-beat Saint Marie... -Dwayne...

42:46.960 --> 42:50.480
That is either genius, or slanderous libel.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.600
Can we get access to his statements?

42:50.520 --> 42:53.600
-I already got it.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.200
-Sir, you said I should get

42:55.240 --> 42:57.720
-everybody that's connected to the team.

42:59.280 --> 43:03.960
Ha! Here! Large cash withdrawals!

42:59.280 --> 43:03.960
5,000 and 10,000!

43:04.000 --> 43:06.520
-So...

43:06.560 --> 43:11.480
Laymon and the Commissioner's toad were in it together

43:06.560 --> 43:11.480
up to their necks...

43:14.280 --> 43:17.920
Perfect timing. If I were to suggest

43:19.360 --> 43:23.000
that Governor-Elect Burrage

43:23.040 --> 43:28.480
was capable of match-fixing in order to win

43:23.040 --> 43:28.480
the ABV final...

43:28.520 --> 43:30.080
What would you say?

43:32.880 --> 43:36.120
ANTON:  I need to get this

43:32.880 --> 43:36.120
straight in my head.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
You are actually accusing me of fixing matches?

43:42.040 --> 43:46.000
Those are some large sums of money

43:42.040 --> 43:46.000
leaving your account of late,

43:46.040 --> 43:47.880
and it seems to correspond

43:47.920 --> 43:51.160
with significant key matches throughout the games.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.160
They also correspond to the end

43:51.200 --> 43:54.160
of the tax year, Selwyn,

43:54.200 --> 43:55.960
when, as you know,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.600
I'm always very keen to donate any excess I have

43:58.640 --> 44:02.040
to worthy charitable foundations.

44:02.080 --> 44:06.240
Charitable foundations of which you, presumably,

44:02.080 --> 44:06.240
are the patron?

44:06.280 --> 44:08.520
But I suspect,

44:08.560 --> 44:11.200
if I were to continue to follow the paper trail,

44:11.240 --> 44:14.880
I would inevitably discover just whose pocket

44:14.920 --> 44:16.400
that money ends up in.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.680
Why don't you do that, then?

44:24.400 --> 44:28.000
Erm, would you mind showing me your mobile?

44:35.160 --> 44:39.240
I did tell you I had my best team on the job.

44:39.280 --> 44:43.640
They secured this phone from one of our players.

44:43.680 --> 44:48.600
A call had been made to it the day of the semi-final

44:48.640 --> 44:51.000
offering a sum of money very similar

44:51.040 --> 44:52.960
to the ones you so generously

44:53.000 --> 44:54.840
donate to your charitable causes.

44:56.080 --> 44:59.720
The number, naturally, was unregistered.

45:01.320 --> 45:02.760
Shall we dial it?

45:05.120 --> 45:06.480
Ah!

45:24.360 --> 45:26.640
Was there... Anything else?

45:33.480 --> 45:34.480
Sorry, Chief.

45:38.640 --> 45:41.200
Don't be. It was an inspired thought.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.680
But if it was his phone, it wasn't there.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.760
Maybe we should go and talk to Hank Laymon?

45:45.800 --> 45:50.240
No, not yet. He'll just deny everything, say he used

45:45.800 --> 45:50.240
the money for something else.

45:50.280 --> 45:53.960
Even though he's our prime suspect, we still have

45:50.280 --> 45:53.960
no way of placing him

45:54.000 --> 45:56.400
at the murder scene or, more importantly,

45:56.440 --> 45:59.160
getting him to the beach to dump the body.

45:59.200 --> 46:03.160
And there's that question again!

45:59.200 --> 46:03.160
Why dump the body?

46:11.000 --> 46:13.640
Which one of you weighs closest to ten stone?

46:16.640 --> 46:20.160
-Ow! -Careful, sir!

46:16.640 --> 46:20.160
Please! Er, Okay...

46:20.200 --> 46:23.440
Stop grabbing my jacket. You're supposed to be dead!

46:23.480 --> 46:26.280
-I won't drop you! -Whoa! Oh! Excuse me, sir!

46:26.320 --> 46:27.720
No, don't. The killer had to do it!

46:27.760 --> 46:29.840
Er... Okay, quick, do it. We'll assume the killer

46:29.880 --> 46:31.960
opened it in advance.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.080
Sorry!

46:39.120 --> 46:40.360
So... What did we learn?

46:41.680 --> 46:43.720
That it wouldn't be easy.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.200
I think I'll be covered in bruises tomorrow.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.640
And oil...

46:48.680 --> 46:51.280
It serves you right, you should have

46:48.680 --> 46:51.280
put something down first.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.880
Sir?

46:57.760 --> 46:58.800
Never mind!

46:58.840 --> 47:01.400
Oil! Was there oil on the body?

47:01.440 --> 47:03.440
No, of course not, there was a sheet.

47:03.480 --> 47:07.040
Post-mortem bruising can occur when tissue is forcibly

47:03.480 --> 47:07.040
compressed against bone.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.760
It happens when loading bodies onto transport trolleys.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.400
Was there bruising? No, there wasn't. It would've

47:09.800 --> 47:12.400
shown up on the autopsy.

47:12.440 --> 47:15.400
The bleach! The bleach... That threw us, didn't it?

47:12.440 --> 47:15.400
Stupid Humphrey!

47:15.440 --> 47:17.760
-Letting yourself get led by the nose...

47:15.440 --> 47:17.760
-Okay, stop!

47:17.800 --> 47:21.120
-Why move a body

47:17.800 --> 47:21.120
if you don't have to?

47:21.160 --> 47:23.520
To conceal or to remove the evidence.

47:23.560 --> 47:25.160
Or to provide an alibi!

47:27.480 --> 47:30.120
The car keys, did we find them?

47:27.480 --> 47:30.120
No, of course not.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.520
-It was important, you would've told me.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.520
-Of course I would.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.240
Let's see if it fits.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.600
Ha!

47:51.680 --> 47:53.920
-Not exactly.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.040
I think I know how and why.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.520
-Er, who. That sounds

47:56.080 --> 47:58.520
worse than it is...

47:58.560 --> 48:00.640
I think the how is connected to the who.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.800
I just need to check one final detail.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.280
How do you fancy another jog?

48:06.320 --> 48:08.800
Dwayne, please assemble our volleyballers

48:08.840 --> 48:11.360
and the Commissioner might like to be there, too.

48:11.400 --> 48:12.720
Oh, and that Burrage fellow.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.320
Thank you for coming.

48:19.360 --> 48:22.240
Er, well, you're already here,

48:22.280 --> 48:24.200
so, erm, thank you for...

48:26.040 --> 48:29.360
Yes, well, erm... Let's get started, shall we?

48:31.000 --> 48:32.960
Excellent!

48:33.000 --> 48:36.240
Who murdered Shelly Kennedy?

48:36.280 --> 48:39.320
Well, that was the first and obviously

48:36.280 --> 48:39.320
most important question,

48:39.360 --> 48:41.760
but there was, er, another question.

48:41.800 --> 48:44.880
One that kept coming back to haunt me,

48:41.800 --> 48:44.880
that wouldn't go away.

48:46.680 --> 48:48.600
Why did the killer move the body?

48:50.320 --> 48:52.400
In broad daylight?

48:52.440 --> 48:54.840
Why was it so important,

48:54.880 --> 48:57.600
they risk getting caught to do so?

48:59.160 --> 49:01.960
Quite literally... A killer question.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.080
And the answer?

49:05.120 --> 49:07.840
They didn't.

49:07.880 --> 49:11.720
Because Shelly wasn't killed in her bedroom.

49:11.760 --> 49:15.120
That was why everyone had a perfect alibi for the

49:11.760 --> 49:15.120
time of the murder, see?

49:15.160 --> 49:19.360
Because we assumed that Shelly was already dead

49:15.160 --> 49:19.360
when the Jeep was driven away.

49:19.400 --> 49:22.120
I don't believe she was.

49:25.480 --> 49:26.720
So...

49:28.200 --> 49:29.960
Here's what I think happened.

49:31.480 --> 49:34.360
It wasn't the killer you saw driving away that morning.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.880
<i>It was Shelly herself.</i>

49:38.760 --> 49:40.480
<i>She was the one</i> <i>who drove to the beach.</i>

49:42.080 --> 49:44.040
<i>She was the one</i> <i>who parked the Jeep.</i>

49:44.080 --> 49:46.320
She was even the one

49:46.360 --> 49:48.120
who climbed inside the boot.

49:49.560 --> 49:53.240
Which is where she was murdered all along.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.760
Erm...

49:56.800 --> 50:00.040
-HUMPHREY: Yes.

50:00.440 --> 50:01.800
Why?

50:01.840 --> 50:04.560
Because she'd figured exactly the same thing we had.

50:04.600 --> 50:08.120
<i>That someone was paying</i> <i>to fix the results</i>

50:04.600 --> 50:08.120
<i>of the games.</i>

50:09.880 --> 50:12.120
And that was you, wasn't it,

50:12.160 --> 50:13.440
Mr Laymon?

50:15.200 --> 50:17.480
Oh, I knew it.

50:17.520 --> 50:20.560
Judging from the tapes of the matches we watched,

50:20.600 --> 50:23.280
I'd say we can link you to the match-fixing

50:23.320 --> 50:27.320
of at least four Isla Jonas games where your competitors

50:23.320 --> 50:27.320
were paid off.

50:27.680 --> 50:28.880
Lies.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.880
Then how do you explain the $15,000 bet

50:31.920 --> 50:34.320
you placed with a bookmaker five days ago?

50:34.360 --> 50:37.200
Every penny you had.

50:37.240 --> 50:41.960
You were facing financial ruin,

50:37.240 --> 50:41.960
everything you'd worked for.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.680
That and an overwhelming desire to win

50:42.000 --> 50:45.680
eventually corrupted you.

50:45.720 --> 50:49.280
-Mr Laymon didn't kill Shelly.

50:51.120 --> 50:54.000
In fact, I doubt he has any more idea

50:51.120 --> 50:54.000
who did it than you have.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.040
You see...

50:57.080 --> 51:00.160
Shelly knew that she had to go to the ABV

51:00.200 --> 51:02.720
and report what she had seen.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.520
But before she could do so...

51:07.160 --> 51:09.640
She made a terrible and ultimately fatal mistake.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.400
She shared her suspicions with her killer.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.560
Didn't she, Jasmine?

51:26.480 --> 51:29.400
Out of loyalty, she came to you

51:29.440 --> 51:32.880
and told you that she believed your father was paying off

51:29.440 --> 51:32.880
the teams you played.

51:35.160 --> 51:38.480
That was the text she sent, wasn't it?

51:38.520 --> 51:42.800
"Sorry, but I made the appointment."

51:42.840 --> 51:45.760
You knew she wasn't talking about your foot injury

51:42.840 --> 51:45.760
or Alison Turner.

51:45.800 --> 51:49.600
She was going to the ABV to expose your father.

51:50.920 --> 51:52.960
You said you'd confront him,

51:53.000 --> 51:54.800
to find out the truth.

51:54.840 --> 51:57.640
More than that, you said you'd confront him in a place

51:57.680 --> 52:00.400
where she would be able to record what he said.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.000
<i>To uncover the truth,</i>

52:03.040 --> 52:07.000
<i>you would take him</i> <i>to the bench at the beach</i>

52:03.040 --> 52:07.000
<i>you trained at.</i>

52:07.040 --> 52:11.600
<i>A place where Shelly would be</i> <i>close enough to record</i>

52:07.040 --> 52:11.600
<i>every word he said.</i>

52:21.960 --> 52:25.400
This is the sound of Shelly Kennedy...

52:25.440 --> 52:27.520
Lying in wait in the back of that Jeep,

52:29.240 --> 52:32.960
ready to record a conversation that was

52:29.240 --> 52:32.960
never going to happen.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.720
You see, once I realised

52:37.760 --> 52:39.160
that she wasn't killed in her room at all,

52:39.200 --> 52:41.320
but in the car park,

52:41.360 --> 52:43.400
well, then it was really only you who could have done it.

52:45.240 --> 52:47.680
<i>The person who opened</i> <i>the back of the Jeep.</i>

52:49.200 --> 52:52.120
HUMPHREY: <i> That bed sheet</i> <i>was clever, very clever.</i>

52:52.160 --> 52:54.960
<i>Nearly threw us off track,</i> <i>as you hoped it would.</i>

53:01.280 --> 53:03.160
What did you do?

53:03.200 --> 53:07.360
Tell her to put a sheet down so she didn't get dirty

53:03.200 --> 53:07.360
in the back of the Jeep?

53:07.400 --> 53:10.560
Murderous intent, disguised as

53:07.400 --> 53:10.560
an act of kindness?

53:12.680 --> 53:16.600
You knew that your father had arranged for the cleaners

53:12.680 --> 53:16.600
to go in as he always did,

53:16.640 --> 53:19.360
so you must have known that we'd think

53:20.640 --> 53:23.040
that they'd removed all evidence of the murder,

53:23.080 --> 53:26.000
giving you a cast-iron alibi.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.200
There's just one more damning piece of evidence.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.960
<i></i>

53:35.000 --> 53:37.120
<i>You had to dispose of them</i> <i>somewhere.</i>

53:38.160 --> 53:39.280
But where?

53:40.560 --> 53:41.800
Where?

53:41.840 --> 53:43.200
Pull over!

53:49.160 --> 53:50.840
How was your jog, JP?

53:54.240 --> 53:57.320
Pretending to be grief-stricken

53:54.240 --> 53:57.320
on the ride home was smart.

53:57.360 --> 53:59.720
But you should have found a better place to

53:57.360 --> 53:59.720
hide the keys.

54:11.320 --> 54:13.000
Jasmine...

54:13.040 --> 54:15.680
We'd have lost everything.

54:15.720 --> 54:19.040
Our money, our reputation.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.880
Win at any cost, that's what you taught me.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.800
At any cost?

54:23.840 --> 54:25.840
Jasmine... No!

54:28.920 --> 54:29.960
Move.

54:34.720 --> 54:36.120
I'm sorry, Mr Laymon.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.720
I think my colleague said it best.

54:43.160 --> 54:45.680
Literary inaccuracies aside,

54:46.960 --> 54:48.760
we all create our own Frankensteins.

54:54.520 --> 54:55.800
ANTON: Be careful with that.

54:57.320 --> 55:00.080
You know, we still haven't found Hank Laymon's partner.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.320
He may tell us, no point hiding it now.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.360
Ah...

55:06.400 --> 55:08.720
Very impressive, Inspector.

55:08.760 --> 55:10.640
It was a pleasure to watch you work.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.440
Thank you, sir.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.080
Please offer my condolences to Shelly's family.

55:16.120 --> 55:17.640
I shall. Thank you.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.480
Selwyn...

55:22.400 --> 55:24.360
Until next year, then.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.840
Hmm?

55:28.080 --> 55:29.320
Oh.

55:31.200 --> 55:32.960
Ah.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.360
Basse Marina, please.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.120
The Marina?

55:37.160 --> 55:38.920
Anton, rather annoyingly for a toad,

55:38.960 --> 55:42.120
travels by private yacht.

55:42.160 --> 55:45.680
So you have to arrange this villa for him, even though

55:42.160 --> 55:45.680
he has somewhere to...

55:46.920 --> 55:48.840
Stay?

55:48.880 --> 55:51.680
Which means that could be where the phone is.

55:52.840 --> 55:54.080
-I'll drive. -Come on.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.760
A-ha!

56:43.240 --> 56:46.120
One killer and one corrupt politician brought to justice.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.800
I say we've earned these.

56:47.840 --> 56:48.960
Cheers!

56:49.000 --> 56:51.040
So, how's the room, JP?

56:51.080 --> 56:53.280
JP: Oh, it's better than a police cell.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.640
-Thanks for sorting it out, Chief.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.640
-Not a problem.

56:55.680 --> 56:58.040
She was in need of a lodger, you were in need of a home.

56:58.080 --> 57:00.080
Two birds on one stone.

57:00.120 --> 57:02.840
Isn't it with one stone?

57:02.880 --> 57:04.880
And here comes your new landlady now.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.440
Ah!

57:08.640 --> 57:11.320
CATHERINE: A trecho curry for your first night.

57:11.360 --> 57:14.120
Wow! Er, thank you, Mrs B.

57:14.160 --> 57:16.760
Now, I want to see a nice, clean plate.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.680
So do I!

57:18.720 --> 57:21.080
A bowl of that every week and you'll make sergeant

57:18.720 --> 57:21.080
in no time!

57:23.200 --> 57:24.920
Oh, yes!

57:24.960 --> 57:27.440
So, here's to a job well done and the island's first

57:24.960 --> 57:27.440
championship win

57:27.480 --> 57:30.720
in over a decade, even if it was down to the other team

57:27.480 --> 57:30.720
being disqualified

57:30.760 --> 57:32.280
for brutal murder.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.760
Cheers!

57:33.800 --> 57:34.960
But after 15 years,

57:35.000 --> 57:36.120
anything will do for me.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.880
HUMPHREY: To Saint Marie, then.

57:37.920 --> 57:40.120
-To Saint Marie. -And the North.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.960
The South... I'm from the South,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
-Ah, North, South,

57:44.040 --> 57:46.280
Saint Marie, Islas Jonas, who cares?

57:46.320 --> 57:47.560
To us!

57:49.520 --> 57:51.160
Something wrong, JP?

57:55.480 --> 57:57.160
Oh, that's...

57:59.000 --> 58:02.440
Dwayne, why didn't you warn him?

58:02.480 --> 58:05.120
Sometimes you have to let them learn for themselves!

58:06.240 --> 58:07.400
Cheers!

58:11.200 --> 58:12.240
HUMPHREY: <i> Annette Burgess.</i>

58:12.280 --> 58:14.080
CEO of It's-so-good.co.uk.

58:14.120 --> 58:17.240
DWAYNE: <i> It's a business</i> <i>running these</i>

58:14.120 --> 58:17.240
<i>corporate getaways.</i>

58:17.280 --> 58:19.680
This is going to take a carefully thought-out

58:17.280 --> 58:19.680
strategy, you know.

58:19.720 --> 58:21.160
Or you could just...

58:21.200 --> 58:22.560
Start looking.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.640
Who did it?

58:23.680 --> 58:25.440
That's what I intend to find out.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.880
-WOMAN: She was my sister! -Someone should go

58:25.480 --> 58:27.880
and get Stuart.

58:27.920 --> 58:29.440
-No! -Ow.
