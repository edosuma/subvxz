<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:35.552 --> 00:37.281
You know these funny
cars go so fast

00:37.320 --> 00:39.185
that when the car
hits the finish line

00:39.222 --> 00:41.713
the driver is actually younger
than when he started.

00:41.758 --> 00:42.725
Man, talkin' 'bout

00:42.759 --> 00:44.488
dang ol' greased lightning, man,

00:44.527 --> 00:46.722
just like them ol' odd rod
stickers, man,

00:46.763 --> 00:49.095
still got one of them
on my lunch box, man.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.497
Oh, my God, that's Austin Coil!

00:50.533 --> 00:53.366
Chief mechanic of the John Force
racing team.

00:53.403 --> 00:55.530
Just look at the man.

00:55.572 --> 00:57.130
He moves beautifully.

00:57.173 --> 01:00.165
John Force is the greatest
funny car racer ever!

01:00.210 --> 01:02.201
He's done more
in a quarter mile

01:02.245 --> 01:04.304
than I've done
in my whole life.

01:04.346 --> 01:05.313
Do we follow him?

01:05.348 --> 01:06.315
No.

01:07.350 --> 01:08.442
Yes.

01:13.123 --> 01:15.614
Yo, yo, check it out
dang ol' two o'clock...

01:17.594 --> 01:19.494
Wow, John Force.

01:19.529 --> 01:21.087
Howdy, fellas.

01:21.131 --> 01:22.860
Y'all come out to see
some racing?

01:22.899 --> 01:24.491
Y-Yes.

01:24.534 --> 01:26.502
John Force is talking to us.

01:26.536 --> 01:29.471
So, what kind of time are
you shooting for today...

01:29.506 --> 01:30.632
John?

01:30.673 --> 01:31.640
I can't race today.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.141
I've been feeling a bit sick

01:33.176 --> 01:35.940
and no one should go out
and drive 300 miles an hour

01:35.979 --> 01:38.174
unless they can keep
their breakfast down.

01:38.214 --> 01:39.476
Well, that just blows.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.608
Dale!

01:40.650 --> 01:43.278
I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

01:44.387 --> 01:45.376
Are you okay?

01:45.421 --> 01:46.945
I think I need to sit down.

01:46.990 --> 01:49.481
You know, Force, as long
as you're sitting

01:49.526 --> 01:52.984
you might try sitting behind
the wheel and doing your job.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.018
Dale!

01:54.063 --> 01:56.725
Just a suggestion.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.536
Hey, Mom, I didn't know
you were subbing today.

02:03.573 --> 02:04.767
I am not.

02:04.808 --> 02:07.242
But word on the street
is that Miriam Kaney's

02:07.277 --> 02:10.303
been throwing up in the bathroom
the last few mornings,

02:10.346 --> 02:13.611
so I better put in a little
face time with Principal Moss

02:13.650 --> 02:16.551
if I want to land
that sweet, sweet maternity gig.

02:23.526 --> 02:26.427
This is Mike Soto with
the morning announcements.

02:26.462 --> 02:29.522
Students going on the
Science Club field trip

02:29.566 --> 02:32.034
must have two forms
of permission slip

02:32.068 --> 02:34.662
or they won't be
allowed on the bus...

02:36.072 --> 02:37.903
Thanks for the
big cup of boring.

02:37.941 --> 02:39.875
Tune in tomorrow
when Bobby Hill

02:39.909 --> 02:42.343
takes over the morning
announcements.

02:42.378 --> 02:43.709
Good for you, Bobby.

02:43.746 --> 02:47.739
If I can pull this off,
Class Clown is a lock.

02:55.124 --> 02:59.185
Oh, that John Force
is one tough SOB, I tell you what.

02:59.229 --> 03:01.527
Says here he's going
to be just fine,

03:01.564 --> 03:04.226
right after they replace
70% of his blood.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.461
I'll give him mine!

03:05.501 --> 03:07.366
Us Dauterives bleed real easy.

03:07.403 --> 03:09.064
Dang ol' count me in, man.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.197
So it's settled,

03:10.240 --> 03:11.537
we'll all go
give blood together.

03:11.574 --> 03:12.939
Count me out.

03:12.976 --> 03:15.774
The vast majority
of unauthorized face removals

03:15.812 --> 03:17.712
happen to people in hospitals.

03:17.747 --> 03:20.614
You disappoint me, Dale.

03:20.650 --> 03:22.481
Get in line.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.586
Yep.

03:31.995 --> 03:34.259
Yep.

03:36.332 --> 03:39.460
That silent treatment
won't work on me.

03:39.502 --> 03:43.404
I don't need you to talk to.
I have my thoughts.

03:43.439 --> 03:45.771
I can't be alone
with my thoughts!

03:45.808 --> 03:47.503
You've heard them!

03:47.543 --> 03:49.374
Where're you going?

03:49.412 --> 03:51.471
We're going to the blood bank,

03:51.514 --> 03:53.812
where we will talk
about old times

03:53.850 --> 03:56.080
and wear new
"I gave blood" hats.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.046
Wait up.

04:00.089 --> 04:02.819
I feel sorry for Mike Soto.

04:02.859 --> 04:05.191
Just because his name is Mike

04:05.228 --> 04:08.493
doesn't mean he should be
talking on one.

04:08.531 --> 04:12.467
You see, Emily, that is the kind
of zing I bring to the table.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.527
Mike Soto didn't have
to be funny.

04:14.570 --> 04:15.730
He had credibility.

04:15.772 --> 04:16.829
You better be funny.

04:19.075 --> 04:20.303
Uh... uh...

04:20.343 --> 04:22.971
Good morning,
Tom Landry Middle School!

04:23.012 --> 04:25.879
In birthday news,
Nurse Barrow turns 40 today.

04:25.915 --> 04:27.382
Of course, that's still

04:27.417 --> 04:29.647
two years younger
than the meat loaf

04:29.686 --> 04:31.779
in the cafeteria!

04:33.856 --> 04:39.158
Would the owner of a red Schwinn
please report to the bike rack.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.322
You left your reflector on.

04:44.801 --> 04:47.497
And that's the bell
for first period.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.734
Either that or the school
doorbell's stuck!

04:50.773 --> 04:54.072
As if schools have doorbells.

05:01.584 --> 05:04.144
Sir, the snacks are for
after you've given blood.

05:04.187 --> 05:06.712
We haven't even checked
for your blood type yet.

05:06.756 --> 05:10.419
Oh, that won't be necessary.
I'm type V.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.808
I'll talk! I'll talk!

05:26.843 --> 05:29.073
Mr. Gribble, you've
just had a seizure,

05:29.112 --> 05:31.012
brought on by
a vasovagal reaction.

05:31.047 --> 05:32.378
You're going to be fine.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.007
You're going to be
better than fine, Dale.

05:34.050 --> 05:35.090
You're going to be a hero.

05:35.118 --> 05:37.382
Why?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.479
Because John Force
needs a new kidney.

05:39.522 --> 05:42.355
All of our blood was screened,
tested and catalogued

05:42.392 --> 05:43.518
into the computer...

05:43.559 --> 05:45.720
Oh, God,
not the master computer!

05:45.762 --> 05:48.162
Uh, it looked like a Dell.

05:48.197 --> 05:50.324
Anyway, the printout
said your kidney

05:50.366 --> 05:52.391
was a perfect match
for John Force.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.925
But I...
I need my kidney.

05:53.970 --> 05:55.904
It keeps
my other kidney company.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.235
Mr. Gribble,

05:57.273 --> 06:00.936
the odds of finding another
match are one in 80,000.

06:00.977 --> 06:02.638
You better get to it,
then, eh, Doc?

06:02.678 --> 06:04.145
There's the phone book.

06:07.517 --> 06:10.816
Dang it, Dale. You're not even going
to think about it?

06:10.853 --> 06:12.753
We're talking
about John Force!

06:12.789 --> 06:14.222
Not for long.

06:14.257 --> 06:16.953
He can have mine,
even if it doesn't match!

06:16.993 --> 06:18.927
Dale, I know
this is a huge thing

06:18.961 --> 06:21.725
to ask of anyone,
but you'd be saving the life

06:21.764 --> 06:23.231
of a true American hero.

06:23.266 --> 06:24.528
Think of it, Dale.

06:24.567 --> 06:25.693
If you did this,

06:25.735 --> 06:27.635
you and John Force would be

06:27.670 --> 06:29.069
friends for life.

06:29.105 --> 06:33.235
Maybe I have been looking
at this thing all wrong.

06:33.276 --> 06:36.006
Gentlemen, let's
go see John Force.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.905
I can't thank you enough
for doing this, Dale.

06:39.949 --> 06:41.473
My kids thank you, too.

06:41.517 --> 06:42.484
They're gorgeous.

06:42.518 --> 06:43.815
Now let's talk turkey.

06:43.853 --> 06:45.115
If you want my kidney,

06:45.154 --> 06:47.247
I've got to get
something in return.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.587
Dale!
No, it's okay.

06:48.624 --> 06:50.148
What can I do for you?

06:50.193 --> 06:51.990
First off, I reserve the right

06:52.028 --> 06:53.586
to call you 24 hours a day

06:53.629 --> 06:55.392
to prove to people I know you.

06:55.431 --> 06:58.161
I do not play favorites
with my organs.

06:58.201 --> 07:00.431
If you take my kidney
on vacation,

07:00.470 --> 07:02.062
my other organs go, too.

07:02.105 --> 07:05.336
And finally, I want you to put
the Dale's Dead Bug

07:05.374 --> 07:06.966
on top of your race car.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.102
That thing's going
to slow me down a bit.

07:09.145 --> 07:11.010
Not as slow as if you're dead.

07:11.047 --> 07:12.139
Deal?

07:12.181 --> 07:14.274
Deal.

07:16.486 --> 07:18.647
Okay, let's get this done.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.916
Where do I go?

07:19.956 --> 07:22.117
Do I have to sit on some
kind of special toilet?

07:22.158 --> 07:26.117
Uh, Dale, you know this
is major surgery, right?

07:26.162 --> 07:27.356
You're gonna have to be

07:27.396 --> 07:29.091
in the hospital
for three days.

07:29.132 --> 07:32.192
I can't afford to be out of
commission for three days.

07:32.235 --> 07:34.203
As one of Arlen's
leading skeptics,

07:34.237 --> 07:36.330
I've got my fingers
in a lot of pies.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.862
But, Dale, you made a deal.

07:37.907 --> 07:40.671
What about all that great stuff
you got from John?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.177
Damn, the stuff!

07:42.211 --> 07:44.008
Stuff is my weakness.

07:45.414 --> 07:47.678
All right, Hank, I'm still
going through with this

07:47.717 --> 07:49.116
if you promise me one thing.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.779
Anything, Dale. What is it?

07:50.820 --> 07:53.516
You have to make sure
nothing happens to me.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.251
That no one steals my brain,

07:55.291 --> 07:57.156
or, if they do,
they replace it

07:57.193 --> 07:59.354
with one of equal
or greater value.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.362
I promise.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.385
There's more!

08:01.430 --> 08:03.193
You also have to take care

08:03.232 --> 08:06.099
of all my affairs,
my business dealings.

08:06.135 --> 08:09.593
While I am indisposed,
you must be Dale Gribble.

08:09.639 --> 08:12.301
Whatever it takes.

08:12.341 --> 08:13.308
So be it!

08:13.342 --> 08:16.778
I'll give John Force my kidney.

08:16.812 --> 08:18.143
The left one, I think.

08:18.181 --> 08:20.877
Let me just redirect
my waste to the right one.

08:24.353 --> 08:27.049
The process has begun.

08:32.227 --> 08:35.424
Okay, Hank, once you sign
this power of attorney

08:35.464 --> 08:39.662
you are legally me
24/7 for three whole days.

08:40.836 --> 08:43.327
Now, the show turtles
get fed every day,

08:43.371 --> 08:46.466
except for the hatchlings,
who eat every hour.

08:46.509 --> 08:49.342
They like a mix
of one-third dandelion leaves,

08:49.378 --> 08:51.209
one-third skinned
chopped mice

08:51.247 --> 08:52.441
and a mango,

08:52.481 --> 08:53.675
but only if it's fresh.

08:53.716 --> 08:55.684
Do not be surprised
if they defecate

08:55.718 --> 08:57.015
in their drinking water.

08:57.053 --> 08:59.248
It's a sign of high spirits.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.585
Where do I get mice?

09:00.623 --> 09:02.523
I left a plate of
bacon in your attic.

09:02.558 --> 09:03.525
You should have

09:03.559 --> 09:04.685
plenty by nightfall.

09:05.728 --> 09:07.423
<i>I can't believe I've got</i>

09:07.463 --> 09:09.158
two more days
of not being funny

09:09.198 --> 09:10.358
ahead of me.

09:10.399 --> 09:12.765
And then the rest of my life.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.894
Funny's all I got!

09:13.936 --> 09:15.198
Look at me!

09:15.238 --> 09:17.263
Bobby, the reason
people weren't laughing

09:17.306 --> 09:19.035
is not because
you're not funny.

09:19.075 --> 09:20.599
It's because they didn't know

09:20.643 --> 09:22.133
they were supposed to laugh.

09:22.178 --> 09:23.270
You are as funny as...

09:23.312 --> 09:25.678
as Wacky and Steve
on Power 100

09:25.715 --> 09:28.081
or even that
Morning Dog Pound.

09:28.117 --> 09:30.017
The only thing that separates

09:30.052 --> 09:31.383
you from them is...

09:31.420 --> 09:33.285
a cowbell.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.119
Really?
Yes.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.751
Your audience doesn't
want to work so hard.

09:37.793 --> 09:39.761
The cowbell enables
them to laugh

09:39.795 --> 09:41.285
without having to think.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.299
The cowbell tells them,
"Yes, the joke is over,

09:44.333 --> 09:45.800
and, yes, it <i>was</i> funny."

09:49.038 --> 09:51.233
Hey, Luanne,
guess what we're having

09:51.274 --> 09:52.468
for dinner tonight.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.600
Flapjacks.

09:55.311 --> 09:57.802
I said... Flapjacks!

10:03.185 --> 10:04.846
Now I get it.

10:04.887 --> 10:08.755
So, all I have to do is ring
that bell after every joke.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.088
You don't ring it.

10:10.126 --> 10:12.686
Your sidekick rings it,
and if they're good,

10:12.728 --> 10:16.129
they repeat what you say,
which makes it even funnier.

10:16.165 --> 10:18.656
Mom, you have to be my sidekick.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.725
Sidekick.

10:19.769 --> 10:20.861
Sidekick!

10:25.875 --> 10:27.365
I couldn't help noticing, Sug.

10:27.410 --> 10:28.843
You're not eating any solids

10:28.878 --> 10:30.846
and you're only drinking
clear fluids.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.872
Oh, that's because
I'm donating one of my kidneys

10:33.916 --> 10:35.383
to John Force tomorrow.

10:35.418 --> 10:36.316
What?!

10:36.352 --> 10:37.512
Oh, did I not mention that?

10:37.553 --> 10:38.645
No!

10:38.688 --> 10:40.178
I won't be home
for three days.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.189
Love you.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.054
Well, gotta get shaved.

10:48.264 --> 10:49.526
Four knocks and a honk?

10:49.565 --> 10:50.725
Gun club.

10:50.766 --> 10:51.926
Three knocks?

10:51.967 --> 10:54.162
Just hand the guy
the Folger's can of money.

10:54.203 --> 10:55.602
This is my business line.

10:55.638 --> 10:59.597
Answer it only
between 9:08 and 9:23.

11:09.518 --> 11:10.678
Gribble?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.312
Uh... I'm
Gribble's representative,

11:12.355 --> 11:13.617
but I'm kind of busy now.

11:13.656 --> 11:14.816
It's here.

11:14.857 --> 11:16.017
What's here?

11:16.058 --> 11:17.150
Do you have a pen?

11:17.193 --> 11:18.217
Yes.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.284
Throw it away.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.023
No records, no trail, <i>comprende?</i>

11:21.063 --> 11:22.690
Uh... <i>Si</i>.

11:26.235 --> 11:29.830
Look, I don't know much
about this... uh, process.

11:29.872 --> 11:32.170
Gribble's got a standing order

11:32.208 --> 11:33.505
for alien urine.

11:33.542 --> 11:36.511
Eight drums, $319.

11:36.545 --> 11:38.342
You won't find a better price.

11:38.381 --> 11:39.939
That seems like a lot of money.

11:39.982 --> 11:41.916
Are you sure
this can't wait 30 hours?

11:41.951 --> 11:44.181
In 30 hours it'll
be pure zefferum!

11:48.924 --> 11:51.791
<i>Good morning, Tom Landry!</i>

11:51.827 --> 11:53.260
Morning!

11:55.564 --> 11:57.395
Let's start with
a look at traffic.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.060
We've got
an overturned backpack

11:59.101 --> 12:00.534
in front of the biology lab.

12:00.569 --> 12:01.467
Whoo!

12:01.504 --> 12:02.471
Backpack.

12:02.505 --> 12:03.699
In sports news...

12:03.739 --> 12:05.263
I still can't play 'em!

12:06.308 --> 12:07.434
No good at sports.

12:12.915 --> 12:14.576
Doctor, how is he?

12:14.617 --> 12:15.982
You're the new Gribble, right?

12:16.018 --> 12:17.042
I need to talk to you.

12:17.086 --> 12:18.451
Octavio?

12:18.487 --> 12:20.614
It's Tuesday. I need
you to break my fender.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.623
What?

12:21.657 --> 12:22.851
Are you asking me

12:22.892 --> 12:24.484
to help you commit
some kind of fraud?

12:24.527 --> 12:27.155
Are you backing out
on me, New Gribble?

12:27.196 --> 12:28.163
We had a deal.

12:32.535 --> 12:34.127
And now we drink.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.762
It's 10:00 a.m.

12:35.805 --> 12:36.829
Now we drink.

12:42.545 --> 12:43.739
Excuse me, Nurse.

12:43.779 --> 12:45.576
Is Dale Gribble
out of surgery yet?

12:45.614 --> 12:47.104
One moment.

12:48.317 --> 12:49.341
He's here.

12:49.385 --> 12:51.410
No, he doesn't seem to know.

12:53.989 --> 12:55.684
I'm sure you're aware, Mr. Hill,

12:55.724 --> 12:58.192
that there are limits
to medical science.

12:58.227 --> 13:00.957
Is this your way
of telling me Dale's dead?

13:00.996 --> 13:03.794
Oh, no, the removal of Dale's
kidney went very smoothly,

13:03.833 --> 13:05.926
but the funny thing is...
after all that,

13:05.968 --> 13:07.299
John Force didn't need it.

13:07.336 --> 13:08.860
He just had a little blockage

13:08.904 --> 13:10.132
in his renal artery.

13:10.172 --> 13:12.299
We were able
to pop it out like that.

13:12.341 --> 13:15.003
I promised Dale
that nothing would go wrong.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.445
Hank, have you ever been
to Mobile, Alabama?

13:18.481 --> 13:20.847
No. What does that
have to do with anything?

13:20.883 --> 13:22.714
There's a special
young man there

13:22.751 --> 13:24.343
who sure could use a kidney.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.853
Little Timmy Croston.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.517
Ten years old, adorable,
partly because he's so small.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.820
I spoke with Timmy's parents

13:30.860 --> 13:32.122
just ten minutes ago.

13:32.161 --> 13:34.061
They are ready to
jet-copter him out here

13:34.096 --> 13:35.495
as soon as you give the word.

13:35.531 --> 13:36.691
Oh, I-I don't know.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.461
This is a big decision.

13:38.501 --> 13:40.992
Can't we wait
till Dale comes to?

13:41.036 --> 13:42.628
We don't have
that kind of time,

13:42.671 --> 13:45.003
and you have Mr. Gribble's
power of attorney.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.735
Okay, okay, let me

13:47.776 --> 13:49.676
think about this for a second.

13:49.712 --> 13:51.509
What's there to think about?

13:51.547 --> 13:52.912
What kind of person
wouldn't give

13:52.948 --> 13:54.108
a ten-year-old
boy a kidney?

13:54.149 --> 13:55.275
Well...

13:55.317 --> 13:56.875
Dale.
Mr. Hill,

13:56.919 --> 13:58.648
we need your decision.

14:01.991 --> 14:05.256
Nancy, what's Redcorn
doing in our shower?

14:07.062 --> 14:08.222
Hey, Hank.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.960
How's John Force
enjoying my kidney?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.197
Uh... well,
a funny thing happened.

14:14.236 --> 14:17.364
John didn't actually need it.

14:17.406 --> 14:18.703
Then where is it?

14:20.175 --> 14:22.939
I promised your kidney
to a ten-year-old boy.

14:22.978 --> 14:23.774
What?

14:23.812 --> 14:25.074
You can't do that.

14:26.348 --> 14:27.975
I can't believe this.

14:28.017 --> 14:30.485
You were supposed
to protect me.

14:30.519 --> 14:31.247
Oh, God!

14:31.287 --> 14:32.413
They know I know!

14:32.454 --> 14:33.785
I'm in the network!

14:33.822 --> 14:37.519
Why-Why isn't my head
wrapped in tinfoil?

14:37.560 --> 14:40.620
Mr. Gribble, we're going
to need you to calm down.

14:40.663 --> 14:41.322
Look at me.

14:43.732 --> 14:45.029
It's happening!

14:45.067 --> 14:47.092
The harvest has begun!

14:47.136 --> 14:49.366
How could you let this
happen to me, Hank?

14:49.405 --> 14:50.372
I trusted you!

14:50.406 --> 14:53.569
I trus...

14:53.609 --> 14:54.940
Sorry, Dale, I...

14:54.977 --> 14:57.377
Mr. Hill, you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.711
That was just some typical
post-op dementia

14:59.748 --> 15:01.306
brought on by the anesthesia.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.045
It was not
the real Dale talking.

15:03.085 --> 15:05.417
No, that was him.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.322
Ouch!

15:14.363 --> 15:16.456
Hank, my leg is not
your conscience.

15:16.498 --> 15:17.931
Quit kicking it.

15:17.967 --> 15:20.697
Yeah, I have nothing
to be ashamed about.

15:20.736 --> 15:22.499
I mean, it's
a ten-year-old boy.

15:22.538 --> 15:24.472
I did the right thing.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.269
Right? Right.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.510
But how can it be
the right thing

15:29.545 --> 15:31.240
to stab a friend in the back?

15:31.280 --> 15:32.474
And stab in the back.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.673
Oh, sorry, you did
the right thing.

15:48.931 --> 15:49.898
Ah!

15:49.932 --> 15:51.229
Octavio?

15:51.266 --> 15:53.325
Yo, <i>ese,</i> where's
Gribble's kidney?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.166
I lined up a buyer in Caracas.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.002
He outbid this dude
in Ireland by 40 euros.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.871
Dale's kidney isn't in there.

15:59.908 --> 16:01.239
It's at the hospital.

16:01.276 --> 16:02.436
Oh.

16:10.786 --> 16:11.980
This is it, Mom,

16:12.021 --> 16:13.010
our last show.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.317
Word is if it goes well,

16:14.356 --> 16:15.414
we're getting a spot

16:15.457 --> 16:16.947
in the school time capsule.

16:16.992 --> 16:18.755
I am ready.

16:18.794 --> 16:20.989
Peggy, thank God
you were standing here.

16:21.030 --> 16:23.260
Sarah Cook just got
a DWI on her way in.

16:23.298 --> 16:24.959
How would you like
to sub Spanish?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.400
Now it's going to require
a two-week commitment.

16:27.436 --> 16:28.630
Oh, my God.

16:28.671 --> 16:30.798
I could give a test
and grade it?

16:30.839 --> 16:31.806
Great.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.898
Well, move it.

16:32.941 --> 16:34.306
There's a fish tank
in that classroom

16:34.343 --> 16:35.503
I've got a bad feeling about.

16:39.548 --> 16:43.006
Bobby, I know you can
do this on your own.

16:43.052 --> 16:44.713
Oh, sure...

16:47.856 --> 16:50.188
But you won't have to.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.257
Principal Moss, I am sorry,

16:53.295 --> 16:55.525
but I have a previous
commitment.

16:55.564 --> 16:56.826
Okay, Schmidt,

16:56.865 --> 16:58.833
you're going to the show.

17:00.936 --> 17:04.303
Good Morning,
Tom Laundry Middle School!

17:04.339 --> 17:06.465
I hope you're all clean.

17:06.508 --> 17:07.497
Tom Laundry!

17:09.444 --> 17:11.037
Dale?

17:11.079 --> 17:12.672
Look, I know
that you and Octavio

17:12.714 --> 17:14.683
are trying
to sell your kidney,

17:14.717 --> 17:16.082
and I can't let it happen.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.586
Not when there's a ten-year-old
boy who needs it.

17:18.619 --> 17:21.589
It's okay, Hank.
We called that off.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.251
I put you in charge
for a reason.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.454
I knew you'd do
the right thing

17:26.494 --> 17:28.622
when I couldn't be trusted to.

17:28.664 --> 17:31.064
Thanks, friend.

17:54.823 --> 17:58.987
Dr. Tabor, I think Dale's kidney
could be in danger.

17:59.027 --> 18:01.188
Mr. Hill, despite
our little oversight

18:01.230 --> 18:02.822
with John Force, I assure you

18:02.865 --> 18:04.594
we are on top of...
Good God!

18:12.641 --> 18:13.630
It's mine.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.233
Let's get you home.

18:21.283 --> 18:22.443
His kidney's gone!

18:29.558 --> 18:31.219
Losing strength...

18:31.260 --> 18:34.252
must maintain focus.

18:35.831 --> 18:37.492
Hey-yah!

18:58.821 --> 19:01.688
Excuse me, Doc... small
change in your skedge.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.157
You're to reimplant
this kidney in me

19:04.193 --> 19:06.559
for safe-keeping,
and then re-extract it

19:06.595 --> 19:08.426
when I locate
a suitable buyer.

19:08.463 --> 19:09.691
Dale, stop!

19:13.435 --> 19:14.800
Back off.

19:14.837 --> 19:16.998
Come any closer
and this baby's good

19:17.039 --> 19:19.633
for nothing but
an Englishman's breakfast.

19:19.675 --> 19:20.733
Now Dale, hold on.

19:20.776 --> 19:22.334
Let's just talk about this.

19:22.377 --> 19:23.503
No.

19:23.545 --> 19:26.013
Now, I'm going to need
an unmarked jet

19:26.048 --> 19:29.142
and two parachutes,
one kidney-sized. Also...

19:29.184 --> 19:30.412
There's no time for this.

19:30.452 --> 19:31.817
In another couple of hours,

19:31.854 --> 19:34.220
this kidney's going
to be of no use to anyone.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.520
Then I've got no
time for chitchat.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.897
Oh, a visitor.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.464
Uh... no.

20:00.515 --> 20:03.211
You the kidney kid they're
making all the noise about?

20:03.252 --> 20:05.049
Yeah.
What do you want?

20:05.087 --> 20:07.112
$43,000.

20:07.155 --> 20:08.622
I don't have that.

20:08.657 --> 20:11.751
Well, if you want my kidney,
it's not a one-way street.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.193
I'll start with this.
What else you got?

20:15.497 --> 20:16.555
Hmm...

20:16.598 --> 20:17.690
These any good?

20:17.733 --> 20:18.859
I don't know.

20:18.901 --> 20:20.163
I want all of them.

20:20.202 --> 20:21.499
And the fire truck

20:21.536 --> 20:23.731
and the catcher's mitt
and that Jell-O.

20:23.772 --> 20:24.704
Okay.

20:24.740 --> 20:25.672
Deal.

20:30.345 --> 20:31.573
At least once a week,

20:31.613 --> 20:33.410
give him a can
of Mountain Dew.

20:33.448 --> 20:34.608
He likes that.

20:39.388 --> 20:42.016
Dale, here's your
power of attorney back.

20:42.057 --> 20:44.423
You were right:
It isn't easy being you.

20:44.459 --> 20:45.517
I know.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.255
Did you get me
the alien urine?

20:47.296 --> 20:48.661
Uh, yup.

20:48.697 --> 20:51.063
It cost $319.

20:51.099 --> 20:52.191
That's my rate.

20:52.234 --> 20:53.758
And you assisted Octavio.

20:53.802 --> 20:55.895
Bashed his fender with rebar.

20:55.938 --> 20:57.235
That's my MO.

20:57.272 --> 20:59.832
Hank, it sounds like
you did everything right

20:59.875 --> 21:01.536
except giving away my kidney.

21:01.576 --> 21:04.773
And since I traded it
for a bunch of kiddie toys,

21:04.813 --> 21:06.804
I guess we both let me down.

21:08.650 --> 21:11.141
So, while you were me,
did you sleep with Nancy?

21:11.186 --> 21:12.244
No!

21:12.287 --> 21:13.879
Too late!

21:13.922 --> 21:19.325
