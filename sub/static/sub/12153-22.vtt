00:01.300 --> 00:02.900
<i>Previously on</i> Angel.

00:02.900 --> 00:05.400
<i>A Black Thorn is the senior</i>
<i>partners'instrument on Earth.</i>

00:05.400 --> 00:08.100
He wouldn't make it on the circle's radar
till he killed one of his lieutenants.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.900
<i>Welcome to the fold.</i>

00:10.900 --> 00:12.700
We know what
you been doin'.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.700
- [Gasps]
<i>- Involvare.</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:23.300
- All right. We have six minutes.
- Till what?

00:23.300 --> 00:26.900
The glamour collapses.
As far as anyone outside is concerned,
we're at each other's throats.

00:26.900 --> 00:31.800
<i>I'm talking about killing every</i>
<i>single member of the Black Thorn.</i>

00:31.800 --> 00:34.700
You need to decide
if that's worth dying for.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.500
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

00:43.900 --> 00:46.400
Then we're all agreed.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.200
<i>Yeah. We're all one big</i>
<i>happy Manson family.</i>

00:50.200 --> 00:52.900
- We taking 'em all at once?
- Can't.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.900
The Circle of the Black Thorn is the most
powerful group in this plane of existence.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.000
<i>Together, they'd vaporize us.</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
But separated,
they're just demons.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.100
- When do we make our move?
- Soon.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.000
In the meantime,
we keep up the infighting.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.900
The circle needs to believe
we're comin' apart.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.100
- What about Illyria?
- What about her?

01:09.100 --> 01:11.900
Move like this, wouldn't hate
having Blue Thunder in our corner.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.700
Can't trust she'll
come down on our side.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.200
Oh, trust me. She's housebroken.
She was babysittin' Drogyn...

01:17.200 --> 01:19.600
- She was with Drogyn?
<i>- Relax. The two of'em were gettin'on well.</i>

01:19.600 --> 01:21.800
<i>- You have to get over there now.</i>
<i>- Why? What is it?</i>

01:21.800 --> 01:24.600
Drogyn's dead.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.200
And, uh, how do
you know <i>that,</i> Kreskin?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.200
- Because I killed him.
- What?

01:30.300 --> 01:32.500
Ow! You son of a...

01:32.500 --> 01:36.300
Sorry. Didn't know
you were... in conference.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.300
I was just making
a closing statement.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.100
Unless somebody
didn't hear me.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Up to you too, Wes. Illyria's your responsibility.
Make sure she doesn't get twitchy.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.100
- [Slams]
- Well, you've got yourself a problem.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.100
Nothing you have
to worry about.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.100
Oh, not me.
Your new friends, the Black Thorn.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.200
They're very concerned.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.100
Tell 'em to send me a memo.
I'm busy. Trying to run a business.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.900
You can tell them yourself.
They want to see you right now.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.100
No rest for the wicked.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.200
[Wesley]
Illyria.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.400
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Bloody hell.</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:13.200
Illyria, can you hear me?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.300
Who did this to you?

03:22.200 --> 03:25.700
It was Hamilton.
Took Drogyn.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.600
<i>[Lorne]</i>
<i>Straight to his buddy, Angel.</i>

03:27.600 --> 03:31.300
I'm telling you.
Our fearless leader has fearlessly lost it.

03:31.300 --> 03:34.100
There's no part of this that makes

03:34.100 --> 03:36.900
I don't think we're
being monitored here.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.300
I'm not playing
to the crowd, Gunn.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.900
I still don't trust the man.

03:40.900 --> 03:44.500
We don't have to trust him.
We just gotta pray the Black Circle does.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.000
[All]
...the world's woe, now convene.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.800
All is bound by the circle
and its thorns...

03:52.100 --> 03:55.000
invisible, inviolate.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.700
We, the seeds of the storm at the center
of the world's woe, now convene.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.400
The circle does not abide secrets.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.800
Which is interesting
for a secret society.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.600
Remember your place, vampire.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.500
[Angel]
My place is in the circle.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.900
This morning's insurrection
did not go unnoticed.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.900
- You mean my people.
<i>- They tried to kill you.</i>

04:30.900 --> 04:33.200
An embarrassing affront,
to say the least.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.800
And a stepping stone
to disaster.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.600
You have ascended, Angel. You should
not be burdened with this kind of...

04:40.600 --> 04:43.800
[Gasps]

04:43.800 --> 04:49.100
Sebassis, your manservant has become
tangled in my bodily fluids again!

04:49.100 --> 04:52.300
- [Yelps]
<i>- My</i> people are the problem?

04:52.300 --> 04:54.300
Some of them, yes.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.100
<i>Some?</i>
<i>Who missed the cut?</i>

04:58.100 --> 05:01.000
We're interested in Mr. Wyndam-Pryce.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.400
He seems intriguingly unstable.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.300
<i>Mr. Gunn, on</i>
<i>the other hand, does not.</i>

05:07.300 --> 05:09.600
Which is a pity.
He had so much potential.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.100
He is not, however,
our greatest concern.

05:13.100 --> 05:18.200
If the next words out of your mouth are
"Kill Spike," we just might have to kiss.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.200
Spike is not the threat.
You are.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.600
You've proven your loyalty
to the circle.

05:28.900 --> 05:32.100
<i>Regrettably, there's</i>
<i>something stronger than loyalty.</i>

05:33.100 --> 05:34.400
Hope.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.800
- [Angel] This is the Shanshu prophecy.
<i>- The original.</i>

05:40.800 --> 05:44.600
"The vampire with a soul will play
a pivotal role in the apocalypse."

05:44.900 --> 05:48.700
<i>[Vail]</i>
<i>"And as a reward will become human."</i>

05:49.000 --> 05:52.300
<i>[Sebassis] Aparanoid person might</i>
<i>think you're trying to manipulate us...</i>

05:52.300 --> 05:55.000
in an attempt
to fulfill this prophecy.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.200
I have no desire
to become human.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.100
Oh, good.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.300
Then you won't mind signing
that pesky future away.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.100
<i>Through that document,</i>
<i>the prophecy can be undone.</i>

06:05.100 --> 06:08.100
<i>Your signature there will</i>
<i>remove any opportunity...</i>

06:08.100 --> 06:12.500
<i>that you will ever earn your</i>
<i>once-precious humanity.</i>

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Will you sign it?

06:16.400 --> 06:19.200
Of course.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.500
- [Groans]
- It's gotta be signed in blood.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.400
[Groans]

06:38.800 --> 06:40.900
Um, Angel?

06:42.300 --> 06:44.100
Just wondering
where everybody is.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.300
You ever miss it?

06:51.300 --> 06:54.700
You were turned, what,
five years ago?

06:56.300 --> 06:58.300
Oh, that.

06:58.300 --> 07:01.300
Yeah. Graduation night.

07:05.100 --> 07:09.100
I don't know. It's weird.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.000
Part of me always knew life
would end after high school.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.400
I was very popular, you know.
The whole golden years thing.

07:19.100 --> 07:23.400
I don't remember what
it was like, being human.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.300
It was too long ago.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.300
Not so great.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.200
Zits, dandruff, mortality.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.000
Although, I do remember...

07:34.300 --> 07:36.300
my heart.
[Sighs]

07:36.300 --> 07:40.800
And the way it would thump when I kissed
a really hot boy for the first time.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.000
That was cool.

07:47.500 --> 07:52.200
Angel, something's
going down, isn't it?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.700
And everybody's
in on it <i>except me.</i>

07:57.700 --> 07:59.900
- You're not a part of this.
- I could be.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.800
I'm your assistant, after all.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.200
I could, I don't know,
assist you or something.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.200
- Hamilton.
- Hamilton?

08:09.200 --> 08:13.200
I need to get some things done,
pay a quiet visit to Archduke Sebassis.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.200
- I'd like to keep our liaison out of the loop.
- Out of the loop?

08:16.200 --> 08:18.600
- That's where I live.
- Distract him. I don't care how.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
Throw some punches at him,
some files.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.500
Just keep him busy
for as long as you can.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.500
What are you gonna do now?

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
One more thing
I don't want to.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.300
You gotta be joking.

08:30.300 --> 08:35.000
Why on God's green and verdant earth
would I trust you?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.500
Huh? Or you trust me?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
'Cause it's not about us, Lindsey.

08:39.500 --> 08:44.000
It's about <i>them.</i> The wolf,
the ram, the hart.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.100
The ones we've been
fighting against forever.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.600
You can't beat 'em.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.600
Maybe they're not
there to be beat.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.700
<i>Maybe they're there</i>
<i>to be fought.</i>

08:51.700 --> 08:56.800
Maybe fighting <i>them</i> is what makes
human beings so remarkably strong.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.800
You're not talking about
the kind of strength human beings have.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.700
This is not about coveting
your neighbor's ass...

09:05.700 --> 09:09.200
your buddy's job,
last Mallomar in the box.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.700
You're talking about fighting flesh
and something that passes for blood demons...

09:12.700 --> 09:16.200
with enormous power,
and they <i>will</i> mow you down.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.400
Maybe.

09:18.400 --> 09:23.200
But I keep thinking that once
this world was theirs, and now it's not.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.900
Isn't it?

09:24.900 --> 09:26.900
Give me the hell
on earth speech, Lindsey.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.300
I know how bad things are,
how much sway the demons hold.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.200
[Scoffs]

09:32.200 --> 09:35.000
I happen to be the greatest
mass murderer you've ever met.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.400
Never given you props
for that, have I?

09:37.400 --> 09:40.000
There's always gonna be power,
and there's always gonna be corruption.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.100
- So again, I ask...
- 'Cause it's not what I'm expected to do.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.900
'Cause you're good in a fight.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.000
And let's say we come up rollin' sevens
and this <i>does</i> go our way.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.600
We tear up this firm,
someone's gonna have to step in.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.500
And I know that's what you want.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.100
I'm a lot more comfortable with the thought
of <i>you</i> in that position than anyone else.

09:56.100 --> 09:59.600
- The devil you know.
- That'd be you.

09:59.600 --> 10:04.000
- And if you roll snake eyes?
- Talk your way out of it.
Tell 'em I forced you to help me.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.900
Tell 'em I made my scary face.

10:05.900 --> 10:09.500
Believe it or not,
I was actually talking about you.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.400
I mean, you care about
being squashed like a bug?

10:12.400 --> 10:15.700
You haven't heard
a word I've said.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.900
[Scoffs]
For, like, years back.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.200
You get a little speechy,
all right? I breeze out.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.300
I got the Cliff Notes.

10:24.300 --> 10:28.900
Honor and humanity,
absolute good. I heard it.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.500
So here's the plot twist. I'm in.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.800
Why?

10:36.800 --> 10:40.400
Everybody goes on about your soul,
vampire with a soul.

10:40.400 --> 10:46.100
Nobody ever mentions the fact that you're
really a vampire with big brass testes.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.200
This is gonna be a circus!

10:48.200 --> 10:51.000
I mean, win or lose, you're about
to pick the nastiest fight...

10:51.000 --> 10:53.300
since mankind drop-kicked
the last demon out of this dimension.

10:53.300 --> 10:58.200
And <i>that</i> you don't do without me.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.300
If you want me,
I'm on your team.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.100
I want you, Lindsey.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.700
Thinkin' about
rephrasing that.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.900
- Yeah, think I'd be more comfortable if you did.
- Yeah.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.000
- How's she doin'?
- She needs more care than I can provide here.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.400
I have to get
some supplies from home.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.600
Watch over her for me.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.100
Fat lot of good that's gonna do
if Hamilton makes another house call.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.800
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Hamilton did this?</i>

11:26.800 --> 11:30.300
- You didn't know?
- He brought Drogyn.

11:30.300 --> 11:35.300
To the circle, so you could kill him
to prove you'd gone over.

11:35.300 --> 11:39.300
<i>Say, any other tips on how to be a hero we</i>
<i>could share with the boys and girls at home?</i>

11:39.300 --> 11:41.500
I didn't have a choice.
They would have killed us both if...

11:41.500 --> 11:44.700
We get it. We'd just like to know
if they're gonna need the rest of us as proof.

11:44.700 --> 11:48.700
- Pick us off one by one, you know?
- No, they won't.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.800
We're killing 'em all tonight.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.800
I want you all to do something
for me, for yourselves.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.600
Take the day off.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.500
What?

12:03.500 --> 12:06.100
If we're plannin' to assassinate the power
elite of the apocalypse tonight...

12:06.100 --> 12:08.100
shouldn't we be cowboyin' up?

12:08.100 --> 12:11.700
We'll be ready. But, today,
I want you guys to go out.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.000
<i>Live.</i>
<i>Do whatever you want.</i>

12:15.000 --> 12:18.800
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Live the day like it's your last.</i>

12:18.800 --> 12:20.800
<i>'Cause it probably is.</i>

12:20.800 --> 12:22.600
[Humming]

12:51.100 --> 12:53.700
<i>[Chattering]</i>

12:53.700 --> 12:56.000
<i>[Cash Register Ringing]</i>

12:57.300 --> 12:59.600
Hi.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.300
[Exhales]

13:08.300 --> 13:11.500
Mmm. Nice crowd.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.200
It can get pretty ugly in here.
I gotta warn you.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.100
What I'm after.

13:18.600 --> 13:22.400
Couple more shots of courage
and I may make my presence felt.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.000
- Your funeral.
- Well, I never had a proper one.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.100
Charles!

13:32.100 --> 13:34.900
Annie, how you doin'?

13:34.900 --> 13:37.500
Oh, pretty good, I guess.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.500
Got a bunch
of furniture donated.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.300
Gotta move this stuff
to the new shelter.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.200
- Still fightin' the good fight, huh?
- That's the drill.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.100
- How are things uptown?
- Well, more fight, less good.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.900
Seen Rondell or the guys? I hit
some of the old spots, didn't see anyone.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.000
They should be around.
Said they'd help me haul this stuff.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.900
You know how it is though.
Things come up.

13:55.900 --> 13:59.100
- You got much vamp trouble these days?
- Never goes away for good.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.300
The boys help out though.
We're pretty safe.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.300
Gives me time to concentrate
on the little things.

14:04.300 --> 14:08.300
Crack, runaways, abuse victims,
psychotics... the old gang.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.000
- Yeah, I remember.
- It's not so bad.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.200
We've had some really decent donations,
and it's helping.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.500
We actually have a part-time
paid psychiatric staff.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.400
What if I told you
it doesn't help?

14:22.400 --> 14:25.000
What would you do if you
found out that none of it matters?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.800
<i>That it's all controlled by forces more powerful</i>
<i>and uncaring than we can conceive...</i>

14:29.800 --> 14:32.400
and they will never let
it get better down here?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
What would you do?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.400
I'd get this truck packed
before the new stuff gets here.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.100
- Want to give me a hand?
- I do.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.400
<i>One, two, three.</i>

14:50.900 --> 14:52.800
I don't understand.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.500
It'll help you heal faster.

14:55.500 --> 14:59.100
- If you really plan to join us in this fight...
<i>- I will fight.</i>

14:59.100 --> 15:01.800
I've been broken
and humiliated.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.000
I will return in kind
every blow, every sting.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.700
<i>I will shred my adversaries...</i>

15:07.700 --> 15:12.400
pull their eyes out just enough to turn them
towards their mewing, mutilated faces.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.400
You're a very inspirational person.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.700
Have I mentioned that?

15:21.200 --> 15:24.200
You are what
I don't understand.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.000
And that would
be different because?

15:30.100 --> 15:34.700
Angel told you to do whatever
you wanted... today.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.400
Tonight you may all be dead.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.000
Yes. Good point.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.100
I am not what you want.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.300
No.

15:48.300 --> 15:53.000
- Then why...
- Don't I go off and have one last perfect day?

15:53.000 --> 15:57.700
Smell the flowers, or skydive, or
have a go with Mistress Spanksalot...

15:57.700 --> 16:01.000
or whatever the hell one is supposed to do
in these situations?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.200
- Mistress who?
- There is no perfect day for me, Illyria.

16:05.900 --> 16:09.400
There is no sunset or painting
or finely aged scotch...

16:09.400 --> 16:12.700
that's going to sum up my life
and make tonight any...

16:15.900 --> 16:17.700
There is nothing that I want.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
You want to be with Fred.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Yes. Yes, that's
where I'd be if I could.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.600
I could assume her shape, make her
come alive again this once for you.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.500
But you would
never ask me to.

16:44.900 --> 16:49.400
The first lesson a Watcher learns
is to separate truth from illusion...

16:49.400 --> 16:52.800
because in the world of magics,
it's the hardest thing to do.

16:56.300 --> 16:59.200
The truth is that
Fred is gone.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.200
To pretend anything else
would be a lie.

17:04.900 --> 17:10.300
And since I don't actually intend
to die tonight, I won't accept a lie.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.800
Is it better?

17:19.900 --> 17:21.900
It's better.

17:21.900 --> 17:25.700
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>My soul is wrapped in harsh repose.</i>

17:25.700 --> 17:29.100
<i>Midnight descends</i>
<i>in raven-colored clothes.</i>

17:30.500 --> 17:33.200
But, soft. Behold.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.000
A sunlight beam...

17:36.100 --> 17:39.000
cutting a swath
of glimmering gleam.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.200
My heart expands.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.700
'Tis grown a bulge in it.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.100
Inspired by your beauty...

17:52.100 --> 17:54.200
effulgent.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.600
<i>- [Man] Yeah.!</i>
<i>- [Cheering]</i>

17:59.100 --> 18:01.600
<i>- That was great, man.</i>
- Thank you.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.600
That was for Cecily.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.000
All right, this next one's called
"The Wanton Folly of Me Mum."

18:07.000 --> 18:09.700
- So she's a werewolf.
- And an art student.

18:09.700 --> 18:13.700
She does this great pottery.
She made me a vase.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.100
But it's the wolf part
that joneses you.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.800
There's some full-moon love,
am I right? Fur flying?

18:19.800 --> 18:21.600
Huh?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.400
So vampires <i>really</i> don't
understand the concept of jokes.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.300
I understand jokes.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.400
I was at the first taping
of the <i>Carol Burnett Show.</i>

18:29.400 --> 18:32.300
Tim Conway was on fire.
It was special.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.100
I know you're my father.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.300
You got your memories back.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.900
Yeah, they're mixed in there
with the new ones.

18:42.900 --> 18:46.700
Kinda like a... bad dream
I had, I guess.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.800
A very strange and violent...

18:49.800 --> 18:53.800
at times inappropriately
erotic... dream.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You probably have
a lot of questions.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.200
No. I don't want to
make a thing.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.800
I get what you did,
you know.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.400
And I'm grateful.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.600
That's as far as
I want to take it, okay?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.000
So, what are you workin' on?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.300
I am, uh, applying for
an internship.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.800
- I'm supposed to write up a résumé.
- Need any help?

19:25.800 --> 19:29.300
Have you ever written
a résumé before? Ever?

19:29.300 --> 19:31.200
No.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.800
- But I have very nice handwriting.
- You girl.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.800
- What are you thinkin' about?
- Angel.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.600
You simply couldn't have said
a worse thing than that.

19:46.600 --> 19:51.200
- No. You know what I mean.
- I do.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.000
It's nice to know you're one of the few things
in my life he didn't get his mitts on.

19:57.100 --> 20:00.300
- I don't believe Angel trusts you.
- It ain't about that, love.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.900
It's about what he needs. And right now,
he needs every hand he can get.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.500
<i>As long as I'm fightin'on his side,</i>
<i>he'll play me fair.</i>

20:07.500 --> 20:11.300
Smoke clears, then we'll
see where we stand.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.600
You sure you can handle
the Sahrvin?

20:13.600 --> 20:16.600
They're sending me in with karaoke boy.
How tough can they be?

20:16.600 --> 20:19.900
- With Lorne?
- What's up? Worried about his reading?

20:19.900 --> 20:21.800
Said your future was
gonna be crappy?

20:21.800 --> 20:25.600
- He was probably tellin' you that
just to mess with you.
- Yeah, probably.

20:27.900 --> 20:32.300
If this thing does go down,
I want you to stay the hell away from it.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.600
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

20:37.100 --> 20:41.400
Damn. Girl, you gave up
immortality for me.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.200
- It's like something out of a fairy tale.
- We don't live in a fairy tale.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>This may come out a little pretentious...</i>

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
but... one of you will betray me.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.700
Wes.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.900
Oh. Can I deny you
three times?

21:02.900 --> 21:05.100
Vail's the sorcerer
of the bunch.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.600
You know that game.
You've seen his place.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.100
<i>He believes you'd</i>
<i>make a play for my spot.</i>

21:10.100 --> 21:13.700
- That's not very flattering.
- It'll get you in the door.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.100
<i>Illyria,</i>
<i>Izzerial the devil...</i>

21:18.100 --> 21:20.800
<i>and three other members of the circle</i>
<i>dine together almost every night.</i>

21:20.800 --> 21:23.600
I'll make trophies of their spines.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.900
Good to have you
on the team.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.400
- Gunn...
<i>- Yo.</i>

21:27.400 --> 21:30.900
<i>Your friend, Senator Brucker,</i>
<i>has a campaign offiice in West L.A.</i>

21:30.900 --> 21:32.900
<i>You already know</i>
<i>she's pure hell spawn...</i>

21:32.900 --> 21:34.900
and she tends to surround
herself with vampires.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.700
I was hopin' it'd be vamps. Haven't
dusted <i>nearly</i> enough this year.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.600
- No offense.
- It's all right.

21:39.600 --> 21:44.100
- Spike...
- Right. First off, I'm not wearin' any amulets.

21:44.100 --> 21:47.600
No bracelets, brooches,
beads, pendants, pins or rings.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.300
Fine. All you need is a rattle.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.600
- Ah, the baby.
- And the legion of the Fell Brethren.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.300
<i>I want the kid returned to his mother</i>
<i>and the foster family dismembered.</i>

21:56.300 --> 21:58.000
Done and done.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.600
Archduke Sebassis has over
40,000 demons at his command.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.900
<i>Other members</i>
<i>of the council fear him.</i>

22:02.900 --> 22:05.500
<i>He's the key player,</i>
<i>so he's mine.</i>

22:06.900 --> 22:10.400
- Lorne...
<i>- Oh, I'm not a fighter, Angelwings.</i>

22:10.400 --> 22:14.300
Never had the stomach for it.
Looks like I'm your weak link.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.000
I need you to back up Lindsey.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.800
- Still can't believe you brought him in.
- He's part of this.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.800
It'll be just as dangerous for him as it
will be for everyone else on our team.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.200
Mmm.

22:33.200 --> 22:37.000
[Sighs] This just gets better
and better every day.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.000
- Anyway...
- Mmm.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.900
About Angel's secret plan...

22:51.300 --> 22:53.800
So I guess we're not goin'
back to the office after this.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.900
The alley just north of Hyperion.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.500
<i>Everyone who makes it meets there.</i>

22:58.500 --> 23:02.500
We do any damage at all, the senior
partners are gonna rain hell on us.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.700
So be ready.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.300
Hey, uh, Ange...

23:07.300 --> 23:12.000
I'll do this last thing for you,
for us, but then I'm out.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.400
And you won't find me
in the alley afterwards.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.900
Hell, you won't
find me at all.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.600
Do me a favor.
Don't try.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.800
Day went by fast, huh?

23:24.100 --> 23:27.900
Try not to die.
You are not unpleasant to my eyes.

23:28.200 --> 23:33.000
Uh, thanks. You...
try not to die too.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.600
Later, then.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.300
What do you think all this means
for that Shanshu bugaboo?

23:51.300 --> 23:54.700
We make it through this,
does one of us get to be a real boy?

23:54.700 --> 23:58.700
Who you kidding?
We're not gonna make it through.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.100
Well, long as it's not you.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.900
I'm curious.
[Slurps] Mmm.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.400
What makes you think
I won't kill you where you sit?

24:14.400 --> 24:16.600
Because you're smarter
than the others.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.000
<i>Smart enough to have</i>
<i>your doubts about Angel...</i>

24:20.000 --> 24:22.200
and rightly so.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.900
He's... unpredictable.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.900
And worse,
he has a conscience.

24:29.900 --> 24:34.200
[Groans]
You make a very persuasive argument.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.100
Wait. It gets better.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.700
<i>[Chanting]</i>

24:44.700 --> 24:47.500

<i>[Brucker]</i>
<i>I can't offiicially comment on that.</i>

24:49.400 --> 24:52.800
<i>But, off the record, if Mr. Conley's</i>
<i>recent confession is true...</i>

24:52.800 --> 24:55.400
then he's a very sick man
who needs professional help.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.300
One of the goals
of my next term in Washington...

24:57.300 --> 24:59.500
<i>is stronger federal guidelines.</i>

Harmony, where's Hamilton?

25:39.600 --> 25:42.000
Records room.
Been keeping him busy, like you said.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.100
Good. I gotta stop by the penthouse,
but have my car ready.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.300
And just make sure
Hamilton stays busy.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.800
No problemo, boss.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.300
<i>- [Door Shuts]</i>
<i>- Going out?</i>

26:08.300 --> 26:10.700
Why? You want to order in?

26:10.700 --> 26:13.100
[Scoffs]
I hear you already have plans.

26:14.500 --> 26:17.200
Gonna take that
when you visit Sebassis?

26:18.600 --> 26:20.900

Ah, oh!

26:32.600 --> 26:35.300
- Oh, my God.
- Hamilton...

26:35.300 --> 26:38.400
He's <i>not</i> my boyfriend.
I mean, I certainly didn't betray you.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.600
- Drop the act, Harm.
- It's not an act. I'm really this nervous.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.300
- I knew you'd turn on me. I just didn't know when.
- What do you mean, you knew?

26:45.300 --> 26:49.300
- Loyalty really isn't high on your list.
<i>- Oh, is that right?</i>

26:49.300 --> 26:53.000
- I'll have you know I am damn loyal, dumb-ass.
<i>- You betrayed me.</i>

26:53.000 --> 26:55.900
You are betraying me now,
even as we are talking.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.400
Because you never have
any confidence in me.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.200
No, because you have no soul.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.100
I <i>would</i> if you had
confidence in me.

27:05.700 --> 27:08.400

- Are you firing me?

27:08.400 --> 27:10.800
Among other things, yes.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.700
- Do you think I could get a recommendation?
- Yeah, okay.

27:14.700 --> 27:18.200
- But see, if you don't so much live
is the other thing...
- It's already in the desk.

- Yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.200
[Sighs, Shakes Out Hand]
Did that hurt at all?

27:42.200 --> 27:43.800
- Little bit.
- Ah!

27:43.800 --> 27:46.900
- [Grunts]
- But it's all part of the job.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
[Groaning]

28:01.000 --> 28:04.600
The senior partners have expended
an awful lot of time and resources on you.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.200
Personally, I would have
told them not to bother.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.900
You're gutter trash.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.900
That's where you
should have stayed...

28:17.900 --> 28:21.100
drinking and whoring your way
through an unremarkable life.

28:21.100 --> 28:26.900
<i>But the fates stepped in and made you</i>
<i>a vampire... with a soul, no less.</i>

28:26.900 --> 28:28.900
A champion, a hero of the people.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.500
Yet, you still managed
to fail everyone around you.

28:33.500 --> 28:37.500
Doyle, Cordelia, Fred.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.200
They're all gone.
It's time you followed.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.300
[Groaning]

28:42.300 --> 28:44.900
Did you really think you were
going to kill Archduke Sebassis?

28:46.400 --> 28:49.300
No. I think I already did.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.000
- [Gagging]
<i>- I spiked his drink.</i>

28:58.000 --> 29:00.200
[Yelps]

29:01.600 --> 29:03.900
I figured <i>you</i> were
the one I needed to be alone with.

29:03.900 --> 29:06.200
Why? So I could kill you?

29:06.200 --> 29:08.900
Well, I thought the fight would be
going a little better.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.500
Oh.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.200
[Gurgles]

29:17.000 --> 29:20.600
Hello, Junior.
Name's Spike.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.900
And lucky for you,
I'm on a strict diet.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.800
Place the Holy Vessel
back in the bassinet.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.900
[Sighs]
Right.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.600
- [Growling]
- [Grunt]

29:40.900 --> 29:41.900
[Scream]

29:44.700 --> 29:47.200
Your influence
on this world is over.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.400
<i>The rest of the circle</i>
<i>will wither and die...</i>

29:50.400 --> 29:52.500
<i>like you are about to.</i>

29:52.500 --> 29:55.400
You don't know who
you're dealing with, do you, boy?

29:55.400 --> 29:58.900
[Groans]

29:59.900 --> 30:02.000
<i>I mean, really.</i>

30:02.000 --> 30:04.400
I crap better magic than this.

30:04.400 --> 30:09.700
<i>Now, then, let me show you</i>
<i>what a real wizard can do.</i>

30:14.800 --> 30:17.000
Why do you keep fighting?
You signed away your Shanshu.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.900
There's nothing in it for you anymore.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.900
People who don't care about anything
will never understand the people who do.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.800
<i>Oh.!</i>

30:26.800 --> 30:28.900
Yeah, but we won't care.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.100
[Grunting]

30:39.600 --> 30:41.500
Care about that,
dress-for-less?

30:41.500 --> 30:43.400
[Grunting]

30:43.400 --> 30:45.600
What the hell
are you doin' here?

30:45.600 --> 30:48.800
Come on. You drop by for a cup of coffee,
and the world's not ending?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.600
Please.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.100
Your families are protected...

30:53.100 --> 30:55.000
<i>against pedophiles and other undesirables...</i>

30:55.000 --> 30:57.600
<i>even in the United States of...</i>
<i>Aah.!</i>

30:59.700 --> 31:02.400
Looks like you boys are gonna
need to find a new candidate.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.200
And you wonder
why folks don't vote.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.300
<i>[Water Running]</i>

31:33.300 --> 31:37.000
- Those guys were chumps.
<i>- Now they're chunks.</i>

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Demon strength or no,
you're quite the master swordsman.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.700
Well, I couldn't have done it without that
high note in "MacArthur Park."

31:43.700 --> 31:45.800
Slays 'em every time.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.400
Any word on the rest of the team?

31:47.400 --> 31:50.000
For all I know,
we <i>are</i> the rest of the team.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.900
I haven't heard squat.

31:51.900 --> 31:55.400
- That's weird.
- They'll call.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.300
No, I mean me sayin' "team"...

31:57.300 --> 31:59.700
and meaning it.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.000
- Kinda like the feeling.
- Yeah, today.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.500
- You really done with 'em?
- [Exhales]

32:07.500 --> 32:12.500
It isn't my kind of work anymore.
It's unsavory.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.600
Gee, I think it's
just getting interesting.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.500
Yeah, I bet you do.

32:17.500 --> 32:21.300
You don't trust me.
You don't think a man can change?

32:22.800 --> 32:26.300
It's not about what <i>I</i> think.
This was Angel's plan.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.600
Come on.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.700
- I could sing for you.
- I've heard you sing.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.200
[Grunts, Breathing Heavily]

32:36.200 --> 32:40.000
Why... Why'd you...

32:40.300 --> 32:42.500
One last job.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.200
You're not part of
the solution, Lindsey.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.100
You never will be.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.500
<i>You</i> kill me?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.400
<i>[Gasping]</i>
<i>A flunky?</i>

32:57.400 --> 32:59.900
I'm not just...

32:59.900 --> 33:03.400
<i>Angel</i> kills me.
You...

33:04.500 --> 33:06.300
<i>Angel...</i>

33:07.900 --> 33:11.500
[Gasping]

33:14.200 --> 33:17.700
[Sighs]
Good night, folks.

33:23.600 --> 33:27.400
[Struggling]

33:27.700 --> 33:31.400
<i>Did you really think you</i>
<i>had a shot at this?</i>

33:31.400 --> 33:35.000
I can bend the very fabric
of reality to my will.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.900
Your parlor tricks could
never kill <i>me,</i> boy. [Laughing]

33:39.900 --> 33:45.000
[Struggling] Then I'll just have to do
this the old-fashioned way.

33:46.400 --> 33:51.100
Yes, I suppose we will.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.400
- [Knife Cutting]
- [Gasps]

33:55.400 --> 33:58.400
- [Grunting]
<i>- [Knife Twisting]</i>

34:05.900 --> 34:07.800
Oh!

34:07.800 --> 34:09.699
[Groans]

34:11.000 --> 34:13.600
- Wesley.
- [Grunting]

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
This wound is mortal.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.300
Aren't we all?
[Gasping]

34:31.900 --> 34:35.400
It was good
that you came.

34:36.400 --> 34:40.699
I killed all mine. And I was...

34:42.199 --> 34:44.699
Concerned?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.900
I think so.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.300
But I can't help.

34:56.699 --> 34:58.600
You'll be dead
within moments.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.200
I know.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Would you like me
to lie to you now?

35:10.000 --> 35:14.800
Yes. Thank you, yes.

35:19.900 --> 35:23.400
[Slurring]
Hello, there.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.100
Oh, Wesley.
[Sniffs]

35:27.400 --> 35:30.400
[Sniffs]
My Wesley.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.200
<i>Fred.</i>

35:34.500 --> 35:37.500
[Whispering]
I've missed you.

35:52.700 --> 35:55.100
It's gonna be okay.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.000
It won't hurt
much longer...

36:00.000 --> 36:03.500
and then you'll be
where I am.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.800
[Crying]
We'll be together.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.300
L... I love you.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.300
I love you.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.800
My love.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.600
[Sobbing]
Oh, my love.

36:41.700 --> 36:46.000
How very touching
his meaningless death was.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.700
But this fight
was never for mortals.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.200
<i>Oh.!</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

36:54.200 --> 36:57.900
Take your best shot,
little girl.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.100
Oh!

37:08.100 --> 37:10.000
What is with you people?

37:12.200 --> 37:13.400
Connor!

37:16.200 --> 37:19.900
Let me say this as clearly as I can.
You can not beat me.

37:19.900 --> 37:24.200
I am a part of them,
the wolf, ram, and hart.

37:24.200 --> 37:28.000
<i>Their strength flows</i>
<i>through my veins.</i>

37:28.000 --> 37:30.100
My blood is filled
with their ancient power.

37:36.500 --> 37:40.300
Can you pick out the one word there
you probably shouldn't have said?

37:43.300 --> 37:46.400
[Groaning]

37:52.000 --> 37:54.700
Wow! You <i>really</i>
are full of it.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.000
What was that you were
saying about ancient power?

38:04.200 --> 38:07.100
You don't really think
you're gonna win this, do you?

38:07.100 --> 38:10.300
You don't stand a chance.
We are legion. We are <i>forever.</i>

38:14.000 --> 38:16.100
[Grunts]

38:16.100 --> 38:18.100
I guess forever...

38:20.700 --> 38:22.800
<i>just got a hell</i>
<i>of a lot shorter.</i>

38:25.900 --> 38:28.800
[Breathing Heavily]

38:34.800 --> 38:38.200
Ah! Is he dead?

38:38.200 --> 38:41.400
Yeah, he's dead.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.700
Uh... that's not good, is it?

38:46.700 --> 38:49.200
Wolfram and Hart. Looks like
they're taking the gloves off.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.200
- What'll we do?
- You go home.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.100
- This is my fight.
- That's some serious macho... Aah!

38:57.600 --> 39:00.000
- Go home <i>now.</i>
- They'll destroy you.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.600
As long as you're okay, they can't.

39:04.700 --> 39:06.500
Go.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.300
What the hell
is going on?

39:23.300 --> 39:25.300
We're gettin' kicked out
of the garden, Eve.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.800
Where's Lindsey?
Where is he?

39:27.800 --> 39:30.700
- He's not comin' for you.
- You...

39:30.700 --> 39:32.800
Time to go.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.400
Go where?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.800
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Boo.</i>

39:50.800 --> 39:54.300
- Anyone else?
- Not so far. You feel the heat?

39:54.300 --> 39:56.000
It's comin'.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.800
- Finally got ourselves a decent brawl.
<i>- [Gunn] Damn.!</i>

40:00.800 --> 40:03.000
How'd I know the fang boys
would pull through?

40:03.000 --> 40:06.600
<i>You're lucky we're on the same side,</i>
<i>dogs, 'cause I was on fire tonight.</i>

40:06.600 --> 40:08.400
My game was... tight.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Supposed to wear that red stuff
on the inside, Charlie boy.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.200
Any word on Wes?

40:25.600 --> 40:27.400
Wesley's dead.

40:32.300 --> 40:35.200
<i>[Illyria]</i>
<i>I'm feeling grief for him.</i>

40:35.200 --> 40:37.400
I can't seem to control it.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.300
<i>- [Shouting In Distance]</i>
- I wish to do more violence.

40:40.300 --> 40:42.600
<i>- [Shouting Grows Louder]</i>
- Wishes just happen to be horses today.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.500
Among other things.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.600
[Growling, Roaring]

40:46.600 --> 40:48.300
[Shrieking]

40:48.300 --> 40:51.200
Okay. You take
the 30,000 on the left.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.000
You're fading.
You'll last ten minutes at best.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.400
[Grunting]

40:56.600 --> 40:58.600
Then let's make 'em memorable.

40:59.700 --> 41:03.100
- And in terms of a plan?
- We fight.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.000
Bit more specific?

41:06.600 --> 41:10.300
Well, personally, I kinda
want to slay the dragon.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.300
[Yelling]

41:13.300 --> 41:17.100
- Let's go to work.
