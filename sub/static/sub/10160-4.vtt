00:01.209 --> 00:02.544
Previously on
When Calls the Heart...

00:02.544 --> 00:05.046
Silas Ramsey
was killed in a robbery.

00:05.046 --> 00:06.298
I might look
into it myself.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.049
Rosemary LeVeaux, I promise,
you will get your theater.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.176
Oh! [giggles]

00:09.176 --> 00:11.052
Mr. Coulter's account
is overdue.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.262
I wonder
why Lee never told me.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.514
[Abigail] I thought something

00:13.514 --> 00:15.056
was starting to happen
between the two of us,

00:15.056 --> 00:16.057
but now nothing.

00:16.057 --> 00:17.142
[Elizabeth] What's that?

00:17.142 --> 00:18.310
[Abigail] It's Frank.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.690
I can't believe this.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.066
It's-- It's got to be a forgery,
or some awful joke.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.652
We'll know
more soon.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.696
Frank said he had a past,
that he'd been shot,

00:28.696 --> 00:29.655
but this...?

00:29.655 --> 00:30.948
The best thing
you can do

00:30.948 --> 00:32.073
is just
open the cafe

00:32.073 --> 00:33.074
and carry on

00:33.074 --> 00:34.075
until Jack hears
from the Mounties.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.744
I can't, not until I know,

00:35.744 --> 00:37.078
and there's no reason for you
to sit here waiting with me.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.622
There's every reason.

00:38.622 --> 00:39.581
You have school this afternoon.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.124
And you have a cafe to run.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.376
[door opens]

00:44.670 --> 00:48.089
Mountie HQ
finally wired me back.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.884
Matt Landry
was on our "wanted" list.

00:49.884 --> 00:50.926
"Was?"

00:50.926 --> 00:52.177
Four years ago,

00:52.177 --> 00:53.971
as an accomplice
in a bank robbery in Platt City,

00:53.971 --> 00:56.473
but he was caught
and he served his time.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.099
Then this is old
and out of date?

00:58.099 --> 00:59.226
There's no current warrants

00:59.226 --> 01:00.268
for either Matt Landry
or Frank Hogan.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.312
So he's not a wanted man
after all.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.856
[Frank] No, I'm not.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.694
[♪♪♪]

01:11.822 --> 01:15.784
[♪♪♪]

01:32.175 --> 01:35.554
Been doing some thinking
and some praying.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.849
I made up my mind to tell you
all about Matt Landry,

01:38.849 --> 01:41.560
but I see someone
has beat me to the punch.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.395
It must be Jesse Flynn.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.689
Jesse said
that he was in town

01:45.689 --> 01:47.733
looking for a friend
named Matt Landry.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.151
Oh, we haven't been friends
for a long time.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.153
Jesse is trying
to ruin my life here

01:52.153 --> 01:55.449
so that I'll join up
with the Garrison gang again,

01:55.449 --> 01:56.700
but it's not gonna happen.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.119
Matt Landry is dead.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.830
Who was Matt Landry?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.791
A greedy fool.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.710
Tried to be a bandit.
Got himself shot.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.503
Went to prison
and found The Good Book.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.173
And when he came out,
he was a new man,

02:12.173 --> 02:14.969
and he wanted a new life
and a new name.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.137
So "Matt Landry"

02:17.137 --> 02:18.179
became "Frank Hogan".

02:18.179 --> 02:19.222
Mm-hmm. Legally.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.683
I went to court
and had it changed.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.102
And that's when I swore

02:23.102 --> 02:25.186
that I would to devote
the rest of my life

02:25.186 --> 02:27.606
to doing God's work.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.191
So why is Jake Garrison
so set on dragging you back in?

02:30.191 --> 02:33.028
Well, my best guess
is that he's planning a robbery.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.196
I used to be a powder man.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.490
I'll let the Mounties know,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.993
get extra patrols
in the territory.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.997
[♪♪♪]

02:44.205 --> 02:46.583
Elizabeth?
I'll walk you to school?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.208
Yes.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.879
Check on you later.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.134
[♪♪♪]

02:55.134 --> 02:56.718
Pastor.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.178
Thank you.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.142
Poor Abigail.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.893
It seems like every time
she has feelings for a man,

03:04.893 --> 03:06.687
he turns out to be
keeping some secret.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.939
And it's never
a good one.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.858
You were really
coming to tell me?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.442
I swear.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.903
I want to
believe you, but...

03:14.903 --> 03:16.071
I know.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.197
The timing's suspicious.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.245
You said that...

03:24.245 --> 03:27.248
you would be
someone to lean on,

03:27.248 --> 03:29.250
and I asked you
to remember that,

03:29.250 --> 03:30.251
when the time came.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.172
Now the time has come.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.508
And it's easier said
than done.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.719
[exhales heavily]

03:41.262 --> 03:43.557
I have to think about it.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.643
[♪♪♪]

03:52.066 --> 03:53.650
[Elizabeth] Do you think
people in relationships

03:53.650 --> 03:55.276
can have "good" secrets?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.612
Sure.
Every now and then.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.407
I don't think
it's a good idea.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.950
So you have
no secrets?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.284
Do you?

04:03.284 --> 04:06.496
Yeah. Well, one or two.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.415
[chuckles] I'll gladly
share 'em with you.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.917
Please do!

04:09.917 --> 04:12.211
Okay. Well...

04:12.211 --> 04:14.129
The first time
that we met,

04:14.129 --> 04:16.924
I thought you were...

04:18.341 --> 04:19.843
Attractive.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.013
That's your deep, dark secret?

04:23.013 --> 04:24.890
Well, not anymore,
since you pried it out of me.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.183
[laughs]

04:26.183 --> 04:27.308
Your turn.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.310
All right.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.771
When we first met,

04:30.771 --> 04:33.273
I thought you were...

04:33.273 --> 04:34.357
kind of cute.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
"Kind of cute?"

04:36.317 --> 04:37.485
Kind of cute.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.613
[laughs]

04:39.613 --> 04:41.281
Not, like,
"ruggedly cute"?

04:42.323 --> 04:43.408
Not even "handsome"?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.035
Well, you did grow on me.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.081
[♪♪♪]

04:52.960 --> 04:54.002
[Katie]
Good morning, Rosemary.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.129
[Rosemary]
Good morning, Katie.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.338
Bill!

04:57.338 --> 04:59.716
I had a lovely little chat
with Abigail yesterday.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.886
She mentioned that you two
are partners in the cafe.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.345
Yes. I bought out
Henry Gowen.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.764
So, tell me.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.267
Isn't that, uh,
a little bit awkward?

05:08.267 --> 05:09.935
What do you mean,
awkward?

05:09.935 --> 05:12.229
Well, considering what's
gone on in the past

05:12.229 --> 05:13.396
between the two of you.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.773
What are you
getting at, Rosemary?

05:14.773 --> 05:16.357
[giggles]
Nothing, really.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.735
Though I imagine
it might be, uh...

05:18.735 --> 05:20.487
difficult to be
in business together.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.030
I'm happy with my investment.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.573
Oh, investment?
Is that all it is?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.366
That's all it is.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.535
Hmm.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.870
So tell me.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.914
Will we see you in an apron
any time soon?

05:30.914 --> 05:32.373
Well, I don't know
about an apron,

05:32.373 --> 05:34.375
but I do have a recipe
for a chicken casserole

05:34.375 --> 05:36.461
that's gonna have them
lining up outside the door.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.298
Mr. Avery!
You are full of surprises!

05:39.298 --> 05:40.381
I had no idea you could cook.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.591
Rosemary,

05:41.591 --> 05:43.510
I spent two weeks undercover
working as a chef.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.720
Not only did I catch
two escaped cons,

05:45.720 --> 05:47.722
but I learned
how to fricassee a pheasant.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.557
[laughing loudly]
Ladies.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.435
Mrs. Ramsey,

05:52.435 --> 05:53.812
I've gone over

05:53.812 --> 05:56.439
your late husband's
life insurance policy,

05:56.439 --> 05:57.440
and everything
seems to be in order.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.318
That's a relief.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.402
Once I submit
the case file

06:01.402 --> 06:02.529
to the home office,

06:02.529 --> 06:04.447
you should see
a benefit check

06:04.447 --> 06:07.742
within, oh...
six to eight months.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.577
I'm sorry,
did you say months?

06:09.577 --> 06:10.662
Barring
any complications.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.413
But I need
the money now.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.414
Well, I understand,

06:13.414 --> 06:14.415
however, the company
needs to v--

06:14.415 --> 06:16.626
No. You don't
understand!

06:17.460 --> 06:18.586
Can't you just

06:18.586 --> 06:20.297
speed things along?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.882
Doesn't work that way.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.760
But... ahem.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.638
If you really
need the money now,

06:28.638 --> 06:33.018
I am authorized to offer you
a lesser settlement...

06:33.018 --> 06:36.355
in cash.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.731
Oh... [words catch]

06:37.731 --> 06:38.773
Well, how much less?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.942
One-fifth the benefit.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.444
One-fifth?

06:43.444 --> 06:45.989
I don't...

06:48.449 --> 06:50.409
Oh, I need to think about it.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.329
Well, I leave
tomorrow at noon.

06:52.329 --> 06:56.166
You let me know
your decision before then.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.796
[Bill] You're telling me

07:01.796 --> 07:03.882
that Frank Hogan
rode with the Garrison Gang?

07:03.882 --> 07:07.052
Under a different name,
four years ago.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.596
I need
to talk to him.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.472
Look, Bill--

07:11.472 --> 07:14.017
I know how you feel
about the Garrisons.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.518
Frank wasn't in the gang
10 years ago.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.686
Remember that.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.190
I need you to do me
a favor, Jack.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.483
I need you to find
a woman named Mary Benson.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.485
It's Carl Benson's widow.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.321
Do that for me,
will you?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.322
Sure.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.827
[Clara] Are you sure

07:32.827 --> 07:34.662
Jesse's part of
that gang of criminals?

07:34.662 --> 07:36.373
Frank is sure.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.498
He says that
Jesse's the one

07:37.498 --> 07:39.209
who put the handbill
on my door.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.086
And you believe him?

07:41.086 --> 07:43.588
[sighs] Jesse didn't
show up for work today.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.590
Jack's been looking
for him everywhere.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.634
He's nowhere in town.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.219
That's not a good sign.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.388
I guess it's not.

07:52.764 --> 07:56.517
Clara...
I know it's painful.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.646
We've both
lost a husband.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.689
It's tough enough
to get through that

08:01.689 --> 08:04.692
and then have feelings
for a new man.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.404
But it's even worse
when that new man

08:07.404 --> 08:08.529
turns out to be--

08:08.529 --> 08:11.532
A liar...
and a criminal.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.700
[hushed]
I just can't imagine

08:12.700 --> 08:14.535
Pastor Hogan is an outlaw.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.703
Neither could I.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.831
He seems like
such a good man.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.501
We'll have to look into
our next pastor's background

08:21.501 --> 08:22.627
much more thoroughly--

08:22.627 --> 08:25.546
Our "next" pastor?

08:25.546 --> 08:27.257
We can't have an outlaw

08:27.257 --> 08:28.758
preaching from
the pulpit, can we?

08:31.552 --> 08:32.929
Ladies.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.977
[♪♪♪]

08:53.158 --> 08:55.576
Not a lot of brotherly love
around here.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.245
Ah, I can't say
I blame 'em.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.956
I disappointed
a lot of people here.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.708
Some more than others.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.211
Jack told me you rode
with the Garrison Gang.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.128
I did.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.588
Ever mention a man
named Carl Benson?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.590
No, but I only
did a couple of jobs

09:09.590 --> 09:10.800
with Garrison.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.012
I got shot, got caught,
did my time. End of story.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.138
What about
this Jesse kid?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.597
You think he had
anything to do with

09:16.597 --> 09:18.183
the bank robbery
that killed Silas?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.977
No, Jesse was here in town.
They sent him to get me.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.063
Besides, it's not his style.
He's not a killer.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.233
You let me know
if you see him.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.568
I didn't think
you were still the law.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.572
Just a concerned citizen.

09:38.537 --> 09:39.579
Constable!

09:43.708 --> 09:46.627
It would seem
that Hope Valley has a problem.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.213
What's that?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.298
Well, our Pastor is a fraud.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.216
He misled

09:51.216 --> 09:53.176
the Pastoral Committee
who hired him.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.928
Well, if he did lie about
his criminal history,

09:54.928 --> 09:57.222
you might have
a case for fraud.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.640
I think it would be
in everyone's best interest,

09:59.640 --> 10:01.851
including Mr. Landry's,

10:01.851 --> 10:03.061
if he resigned

10:03.061 --> 10:04.396
and left town
peacefully.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.646
Mm.

10:05.646 --> 10:06.814
I wonder if you can take
a little bit of time

10:06.814 --> 10:08.358
to convince him of that.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.445
Uh, I'm sorry.
I can't do that,

10:11.445 --> 10:12.571
but have a nice day.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.284
[disengages brake]

10:23.664 --> 10:24.916

10:24.916 --> 10:26.251
[man whistles a birdcall]

10:26.251 --> 10:28.378
[whistles]

10:31.798 --> 10:33.800
Matt's secret's
all over town.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.218
That's good.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.637
Won't be long
before they kick him out.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.016
You got something to say?

10:43.518 --> 10:44.685
Matt's awful stubborn.

10:44.685 --> 10:45.937
I still don't know
if this is gonna work.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.688
Oh, sure it will.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.023
He's no fool.

10:49.023 --> 10:49.983
Where else
is he gonna go?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.192
Just in case,

10:51.192 --> 10:53.612
maybe we should
find somebody else.

10:54.695 --> 10:57.324
There ain't no one else
can do what we need doing.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.658
I can.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.243
[snickers]

11:00.243 --> 11:01.869
Takes a lot of skill
to blow a safe.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.871
Matt taught me
everything he knows.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.624
Teaching ain't doin'.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.792
I'm not gonna gamble our payoff
on what you think you know.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.377
Okay, okay.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.545
I'm just sayin',

11:10.545 --> 11:12.671
if, for some reason,
Matt doesn't come--

11:14.007 --> 11:15.716
You said you and him
were friends.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.511
You swore you could
bring him back.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.719
That was the deal.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.515
Now, if you don't deliver,

11:21.515 --> 11:23.224
you're a dead man.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.685
[♪♪♪]

11:37.405 --> 11:39.949
[chuckling]
Deal 'em again.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.873
Why is Lee
asking the bank for a loan?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.124
I don't know.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.834
You don't know,
or you won't tell me?

11:49.834 --> 11:51.670
When it comes to finance,

11:51.670 --> 11:54.464
Mr. Coulter plays things
pretty close to the vest.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.758
Maybe it's something to do
with the theater he's building.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.636
Mm.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.763
Let's pretend this conversation
never happened, all right?

12:02.763 --> 12:04.140
It'll be our little secret.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.478
In a democracy,

12:08.478 --> 12:11.189
the people get to help
decide how everything is run,

12:11.189 --> 12:13.608
and one way they can do that
is by voting.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.527
Hi.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.986
[shuts door]

12:16.986 --> 12:18.905
Um, would everyone please
turn to page 42 in your books

12:18.905 --> 12:20.781
to learn what
the Greek philosophers

12:20.781 --> 12:22.450
had to say about it.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.535
Hi.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.785
I'm sorry to interrupt,

12:24.785 --> 12:26.204
but you know the campout

12:26.204 --> 12:26.954
that Pastor Hogan has scheduled
for tomorrow night?

12:26.954 --> 12:28.789
The boys have been
talking about it all morning.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.874
Well, so have
their parents.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.334
Some of them
have changed their minds,

12:31.334 --> 12:32.793
they don't want
their boys to go.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.795
So it's been canceled?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.881
No, actually. May I?

12:36.881 --> 12:38.425
Mm-hmm.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.800
Thanks.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.886
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.846
Those who signed up
for tomorrow's campout,

12:43.846 --> 12:46.266
please raise your hands.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.935
I knew
it wasn't gonna happen.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.062
No, no, it's happening, Cody,

12:51.062 --> 12:52.105
but, unfortunately,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.981
Pastor Hogan cannot make it,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.692
so I'm gonna be
going instead.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.818
Yeah, Laura.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.153
Do girls
get to go, too?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.948
Um, sorry, this one
is just for the boys.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.533
I don't see why

13:03.533 --> 13:04.825
-the girls can't go.
-Yeah!

13:04.825 --> 13:06.785
Well, uh...

13:06.785 --> 13:08.371
maybe next time,

13:08.371 --> 13:10.873
when we can all plan ahead,
okay?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.584
Thanks.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.792
Uh-huh.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.841
[Bill]
Dottie? What's the matter?

13:20.841 --> 13:23.720
Mr. Logan
from the insurance company says

13:23.720 --> 13:27.098
it's going to take months
to pay the benefits

13:27.098 --> 13:28.600
on Silas' policy.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.643
Why the delay?

13:29.643 --> 13:31.478
I don't know.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.730
He said he'll give me
cash right now,

13:33.730 --> 13:36.691
but I have to waive
the rest of the benefits.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.859
Well, that doesn't
sound right.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.279
I don't want to settle
for less than I'm owed,

13:41.279 --> 13:42.821
but I can't wait.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.074
Would you let me help you?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.410
What can you do?

13:47.410 --> 13:48.911
Oh, I...

13:48.911 --> 13:51.205
I have a knack
for helping people see reason.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.461
Before you ask,

13:56.461 --> 13:58.045
no, I haven't seen Frank
since this morning.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.422
I didn't ask.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.507
I don't know
what I'd say to him.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.882
I don't know
what I'd want him to say to me.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.259
May I ask you
what you're feeling?

14:03.259 --> 14:05.345
I don't know, so don't tell me
not to bottle things up.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.471
Then I won't.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.681
I could use a little

14:07.681 --> 14:09.223
"You're strong,
you'll get through this."

14:09.223 --> 14:11.685
You are the strongest woman
I've ever met, Abigail.

14:11.685 --> 14:12.893
You'll get
through this.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.813
You always know
just what to say.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.022
You'll get through it
a lot faster

14:16.022 --> 14:16.897
if you just talk to Frank.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.609
Miss Abigail?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.361
Where's those marshmallows
you made for us?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.487
In the pantry.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.364
Can't camp out
without marshmallows.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.906
There's no arguing with that!

14:25.906 --> 14:28.326
I'm glad that Jack is leading
the trip tomorrow.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.869
Cody's gonna have a good time.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.911
It's too bad it's boys-only.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.039
It's really not fair
to the girls.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.207
Elizabeth,

14:34.207 --> 14:36.250
you are the most creative woman
I know.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.127
You'll solve this...

14:38.127 --> 14:39.045

Okay, we are almost here.

the only ones.

[♪♪♪]

14:51.932 --> 14:53.184
Elizabeth?

14:53.184 --> 14:55.436
Good evening, Jack.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.813
What are--
What are you doing here?

14:56.813 --> 14:58.147
Well, I asked the girls

14:58.147 --> 15:00.024
if they wanted
a little campout of their own.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.401
And we voted yes!

15:01.401 --> 15:02.943
Democracy in action.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.029
Great!

15:05.029 --> 15:07.198
The thing is,
you-- you can't be, um...

15:07.198 --> 15:08.742
here.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.076
Isn't this public land?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.494
Yeah, but I mean, this...

15:11.494 --> 15:12.953
this was gonna be
our spot.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.248
I think there's room enough
for everyone.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.124
Right.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.545
Okay. Uh, okay, boys,
let's make camp over there.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.629
Uh, no, Jack,

15:21.629 --> 15:22.672
not over there.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.964
Uh, why not?

15:23.964 --> 15:25.800
Because it's covered
in poison ivy.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.595
[girls giggling]

15:28.595 --> 15:30.179
All right, not there, boys.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.391
Make camp over here.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.350
Thanks, girls.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.395
Back to work!

15:37.395 --> 15:40.231
[♪♪♪]

15:44.652 --> 15:45.986
-Good morning, Lee.
-Hello.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.406
I brought those supplies
you asked for.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.993
Wow, I think
I'm in the wrong business.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.413
Make more money if I turned
my sawmill into a paper mill.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.165
Speaking of money...

15:58.165 --> 15:59.208
Mm.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.418
Funny, that.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.712
Katie Yost told me
your account was overdue.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.256
Really? Hmm.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.092
I don't know if they sent me
a bill last month.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.010
Or maybe they did, and it's just
lost under all this mess.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.429
Anyway, thank you,
I'll take care of it.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.097
So it's just
a misunderstanding?

16:13.097 --> 16:15.141
Of course, yeah,
just a misunderstanding.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.104
Lee...

16:20.104 --> 16:22.189
Mm-hmm?

16:22.189 --> 16:25.025
I really have enjoyed
helping out around here.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.321
And I have really
appreciated having you.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.489
But you're not gonna offer

16:29.489 --> 16:30.657
to redecorate my office
again, are you?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.533
No. Uh...

16:32.533 --> 16:35.035
But I could
help you economize.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.079
"Economize?"

16:37.079 --> 16:38.038
Streamline.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.874
Be more efficient.
Cut out waste.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.126
Improve the bottom line.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.503
[exhales]

16:43.503 --> 16:45.463
Well, saving money never hurts.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.506
Well, that's right!

16:46.506 --> 16:47.590
And you're
so busy already.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.176
Why don't you let me
try out a few ideas?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.427
A "thrift plan".

16:51.427 --> 16:54.514
Cutting expenditures can
boost your profits, you know.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.723
So I've heard.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.724
[laughs] Well, great!

16:56.724 --> 16:57.976
Why don't you get me

16:57.976 --> 16:59.602
your spending records
for last month,

16:59.602 --> 17:00.895
and I'll dive right in?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.438
What, you're serious?

17:02.438 --> 17:04.064
[laughs]

17:04.064 --> 17:06.359
Uh...

17:06.359 --> 17:08.194
All right.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.865
There you go.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.409
[quiet chuckle]

17:16.577 --> 17:18.037
You sure about this?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.873
You haven't
had much experience

17:19.873 --> 17:21.457
in the-- in the wild.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.667
Jack...

17:22.667 --> 17:23.626
we're a stone's
throw from town.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.086
I think I'll survive.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.631
Are you, uh, gonna
start the campfire

17:28.631 --> 17:31.300
by rubbing two sticks
together again?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.553
This time,
I'm prepared.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.095
Oh.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.598
We'll be singing
songs together later.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.350
You're welcome
to join us.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.727
No, we're gonna be--

17:40.727 --> 17:42.102
We're gonna be telling
some ghost stories,

17:42.102 --> 17:44.104
but you are
welcome to join us.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.147
Ghost stories?

17:45.147 --> 17:46.106
Yeah.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.608
Jack, are you sure about that?

17:47.608 --> 17:48.735
Some of those boys
are pretty young.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.777
They might get scared.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.155
Nah. Boys love scary stories.

17:54.908 --> 17:55.950
All right.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.542
You're leaving?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.132
Where will you go?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.010
San Francisco,
for starters.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.803
And what's in San Francisco?

18:15.803 --> 18:17.013
A boat to someplace

18:17.013 --> 18:18.431
where no one's ever
heard of Matt Landry

18:18.431 --> 18:20.058
or Pastor Frank Hogan.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.142
But you won't be
a pastor anymore.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.478
Maybe I was never meant
to be a pastor.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.646
Wrong.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.189
You were meant
to be our pastor.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.983
Well, not anymore.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.526
There's not a soul
in this town

18:30.526 --> 18:32.152
that wants me
to stay.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.112
I do.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.865
And you're still
our pastor.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.284
I told you
you could rely on me.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.913
Well, you told me
you needed time to think.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.415
I took the time.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.125
And here I am.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.922
Maybe everybody else
just needs some time, too.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.632
They won't even
look me in the eye.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.176
If I was a cook
or a blacksmith,

18:56.176 --> 18:57.344
wouldn't matter
what people thought.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.055
But a preacher?

18:59.055 --> 19:00.681
If no one wants
to hear from him,

19:00.681 --> 19:02.391
then he's no good
to anyone.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.268
They've listened before.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.438
All the times
that you preached mercy

19:07.438 --> 19:08.439
and forgiveness,

19:08.439 --> 19:10.190
they heard you.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.735
Maybe you just need
to convince them

19:12.735 --> 19:15.613
that everybody deserves
a second chance.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.158
Fight them.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.162
I'll stand with you.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.209
Got any other suggestions?

19:34.381 --> 19:36.509
[picks up book]

19:38.218 --> 19:40.220
You might pray for guidance.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.181
I'm told it helps.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.186
[♪♪♪]

19:54.610 --> 19:56.779
[owl hoots]
Okay, boys.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.864
You go to sleep.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.866
But what if
a ghost comes?

19:59.866 --> 20:02.368
Well, there are no ghosts.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.245
Tell you what.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.707
How 'bout
I tell you a new story?

20:07.707 --> 20:10.250
About a little... a dog!

20:10.250 --> 20:11.878
I'm afraid of dogs, too.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.048
[mutters under his breath]

20:18.342 --> 20:20.469
Thanks for
taking us camping.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.554
It's fun.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.680
I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.264
Can we do this again?

20:24.264 --> 20:25.265
Of course we can.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.102
Robert said girls
don't belong on camping trips.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.855
I told him he was silly
and undemocratic.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.899
Good for you!

20:32.899 --> 20:35.275
Because girls can do anything,
right, Miss Thatcher?

20:35.275 --> 20:36.276
That's right,
Debra.

20:36.276 --> 20:40.322
Girls can do anything
that boys can do.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.283
Now go to sleep.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.080
[sniffling]

20:47.080 --> 20:48.288
Oh!

20:48.288 --> 20:50.290
Opal?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.292
Are you all right?

20:52.292 --> 20:54.294
I want to go home.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.296
Are you feeling okay?

20:56.296 --> 20:57.840
Not sick?

20:57.840 --> 21:00.300
Just homesick?

21:00.300 --> 21:04.304
Mm. I bet you miss
your nice comfortable bed

21:04.304 --> 21:07.225
and your warm quilt, huh?

21:07.225 --> 21:09.060
Do you have
any stuffed animals at home?

21:09.060 --> 21:10.728
Brownie.
He's a bear.

21:10.728 --> 21:11.854
What kind of bear?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.397
A brown bear.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.315
Oh. [chuckles]

21:15.315 --> 21:18.360
Well, do you know
what Brownie's doing right now?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.654
He's sleeping.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.822
And he's dreaming about you.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.741
Is he sad?

21:23.741 --> 21:25.034
No!

21:25.034 --> 21:27.411
Because he knows
you're coming home very soon

21:27.411 --> 21:30.539
to tell him
all about your great adventure.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.333
How you saw
a family of quails

21:33.333 --> 21:36.295
and... sang songs.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.340
So...

21:40.340 --> 21:42.342
close your eyes.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.261
[crickets chirping]

21:43.261 --> 21:45.429
And listen to the crickets.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.349
And think about Brownie.

21:49.349 --> 21:53.312
And it'll be morning
before you know it.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.732
Would you like me
to sing to you?

21:56.732 --> 21:58.317
No.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.359
You sung enough.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.361
I like the crickets better.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.990
Oh.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.117
Tough audience.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.745
[footsteps]

22:09.745 --> 22:11.122
[door opening]

22:11.122 --> 22:12.999
Evening.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.293
Are you the, uh, constable?

22:15.293 --> 22:18.212
I was told that I would find
the constable here.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.339
He's not here right now.
Can I help you?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.715
Yes. My room
has been burglarized,

22:21.715 --> 22:22.716
my briefcase stolen.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.885
Can you describe it?

22:24.885 --> 22:26.929
Dark brown leather,
hand-tooled,

22:26.929 --> 22:28.388
silver studs.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.723
Something like this?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.433
[laughs] That's it!

22:31.433 --> 22:33.435
How did you...

22:34.895 --> 22:37.023
Who are you?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.398
Are you a Mountie?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.067
Not at the moment.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.652
I'm just a friend
of Dottie Ramsey.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.404
You're the one who broke in.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.823
You stole it.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.449
Nothing's been stolen.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.951
Everything's here.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.036
You can't
get away with this.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.495
You broke
the law, sir.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.705
I'll have you arrested.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.581
On what evidence?

22:54.581 --> 22:58.044
You have your property here,
so it's your word against mine.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.381
[forcefully]
Sit down.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.476
Interesting
reading there.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.813
Curious how the beneficiaries
sign so-called "release forms,"

23:17.813 --> 23:19.982
transferring
their benefits to you.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.276
That's a nasty
little racket.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.778
Lying to grieving widows,

23:24.778 --> 23:27.031
scaring them into taking
tiny cash payouts,

23:27.031 --> 23:28.741
and then stealing the benefits
for yourself.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.534
You can't prove this.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.245
Like you said...

23:32.245 --> 23:33.495
your word against mine.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.088
I'm not the law, mister,

23:42.088 --> 23:43.463
so I can't
send you to prison,

23:43.463 --> 23:45.216
where you belong,

23:45.216 --> 23:48.510
but there are worse places
I can send you.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.682
What do you want?

23:55.559 --> 23:59.230
I want you to write a check
out to Dottie Ramsey

23:59.230 --> 24:02.191
for the full amount
of her benefits right now.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.442
[stammering]
I... I can-- I can do that.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.906
Then I want you to go

24:08.906 --> 24:11.449
to all the other people
that you stole from

24:11.449 --> 24:13.119
and return
all the money you took.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.998
And I'll know if you don't.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.750
I will.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.252
[emphatically] I will.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.510
Pleasure doing business
with ya.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.309
[Jack sighs]

24:36.309 --> 24:37.226
[Elizabeth]
Did you have any trouble

24:37.226 --> 24:38.602
putting the boys to bed?

24:38.602 --> 24:41.688
Nope.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.066
So why are they
all in your tent?

24:44.066 --> 24:45.401
Well, like you said,

24:45.401 --> 24:46.902
some of them
are pretty young.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.070
Mm. Mm-hmm.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.822
Okay, maybe...

24:49.822 --> 24:51.157
maybe we should've--

24:51.157 --> 24:53.326
we should've
sung songs with you.

24:53.326 --> 24:56.120
[laughing]

24:56.120 --> 24:58.496
[sighs and laughs]

25:02.500 --> 25:03.377
What?

25:03.377 --> 25:07.340
You look...
comfortable here.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.509
I am.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.554
This far
from civilization?

25:14.554 --> 25:17.557
No motorcars, mansions?

25:17.557 --> 25:19.643
No French boutiques?

25:20.853 --> 25:23.814
No noise, no crowds.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.150
Yeah, just bugs,
bad weather,

25:26.150 --> 25:27.567
and wild animals.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.569
Bright stars,

25:29.569 --> 25:31.613
babbling brooks,

25:31.613 --> 25:33.573
fresh-caught trout.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.534
Well, it sounds like
you could live out here.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.580
You know...

25:40.580 --> 25:42.540
I think I could.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.003
Well, I don't--
I don't mean in a tent.

25:46.003 --> 25:48.214
I'm talking about a house,

25:48.214 --> 25:50.799
with a nice stove,

25:50.799 --> 25:52.634
bathtub,

25:52.634 --> 25:55.137
an icebox.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.097
[both chuckling]

25:57.097 --> 25:59.308
[sighs]

25:59.308 --> 26:03.437
A nice, warm,
comfortable feather bed.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.023
Waking up next
to the one you love

26:06.023 --> 26:07.565
every morning.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.446
It sounds heavenly.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.743
[♪♪♪]

26:27.627 --> 26:29.587
[♪♪♪]

26:34.385 --> 26:38.097
I think I'd like to
write about life here.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.932
If I'm lucky,

26:39.932 --> 26:42.768
I'll get
published one day.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.062
It's just
a dream of mine.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.314
Well...

26:47.314 --> 26:50.192
dreams have been
known to come true.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.492
[♪♪♪]

27:01.078 --> 27:04.248
[quiet chatter]

27:04.248 --> 27:06.125
Abigail! Care to join us?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.667
Trudy has to leave
after this hand.

27:07.667 --> 27:08.668
Before she leaves,

27:08.668 --> 27:12.423
I-- I'd like to talk to you
about Pastor Hogan.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.632
We owe him a lot,
and he--

27:15.884 --> 27:16.885
What's the matter?

27:18.554 --> 27:21.681
Frank Hogan
is no longer our pastor.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.683
You do know that?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.436
No, I don't.
What do you mean?

27:27.313 --> 27:28.646
Mayor Gowen called

27:28.646 --> 27:31.817
an emergency meeting
of the Pastoral Committee.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.235
We voted unanimously

27:33.235 --> 27:34.820
to remove him and start
looking for a replacement.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.158
You fired Frank
in a secret meeting?

27:39.158 --> 27:41.076
A private meeting.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.202
Why didn't we all
have a say?

27:42.202 --> 27:43.537
To what end?

27:43.537 --> 27:44.997
He posed a threat
to the community.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.248
We knew what we had to do.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.707
It's done.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.001
Undo it.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.210
It's too late.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.420
I've already
informed Mr. Landry

27:51.420 --> 27:52.588
of his termination.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.679
Frank?

28:04.057 --> 28:06.519
Frank?

28:19.823 --> 28:21.950
[Frank] "To everything
there's a season--

28:21.950 --> 28:23.243
a time to keep

28:23.243 --> 28:25.745
and a time to cast away.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.956
Goodbye, Abigail.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.249
I'll miss you."

28:34.754 --> 28:36.298
They fired Frank.

28:36.298 --> 28:37.508
The vote was unanimous.

28:37.508 --> 28:38.676
Wow.

28:38.676 --> 28:39.677
I would've thought
at least one or two

28:39.677 --> 28:40.760
would've stood up
for him.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.803
Gowen hand-picked
that committee.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.805
[Jack] And they did
just what he wanted.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.765
[Abigail]
And Frank didn't argue.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.767
Gowen convinced him
we'd be safer without him.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.603
We can decide these
things for ourselves.

28:49.603 --> 28:50.896
It's too late now.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.651
Maybe not.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.735
[Jack]
Where are you going?

28:57.777 --> 28:58.778
I'm a teacher.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.531
Time for a lesson.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.036
Excuse me, Mayor Gowen.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.080
I want to know
why you fired Pastor Hogan.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.040
I didn't fire anybody.
The Committee made the decision.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.250
[Elizabeth]
Well, the Committee

29:11.250 --> 29:13.460
hardly represents
the people of Hope Valley,

29:13.460 --> 29:14.294
and should a decision like that

29:14.294 --> 29:15.837
really be made
behind closed doors,

29:15.837 --> 29:17.631
without the involvement
of the community?

29:17.631 --> 29:20.426
I'm sure that the community
will support the action.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.801
I'm not at all sure.

29:21.801 --> 29:24.388
Respectfully,
Miss Thatcher,

29:24.388 --> 29:26.806
I don't think there's any point
in rehashing this.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.808
When I informed Mr. Landry
of the decision,

29:28.808 --> 29:30.977
he left town without protest.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.812
I think even he realized

29:32.812 --> 29:34.064
that he doesn't belong
here in Hope Valley.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.609
We have no idea
what Frank Hogan realized,

29:36.609 --> 29:38.235
because you never gave him
the chance to speak to us.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.819
Miss Thatcher--

29:39.819 --> 29:41.196
You may have gotten
your way for now,

29:41.196 --> 29:43.031
but is this really how
you want to be remembered?

29:43.031 --> 29:46.243
As the Mayor who decided
everything in secret?

29:46.243 --> 29:48.495
This is a democracy,
Mayor Gowen.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.414
We deserve better.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.043
[♪♪♪]

30:03.843 --> 30:05.178
Good morning.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.680
Good morning.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.848
Ooh! It's freezing here.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.850
Is there something wrong
with the stove?

30:10.850 --> 30:12.852
Uh, no. We're just
conserving firewood.

30:12.852 --> 30:15.773
Conserving firewood?
I run a sawmill.

30:15.773 --> 30:17.023
We're up to our ears
in scrap wood.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.858
Yes, and we should
be selling it,

30:18.858 --> 30:19.859
not burning it.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.861
Besides, it's a balmy day.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.447
Just dress warm.
You won't even feel it.

30:23.447 --> 30:26.366
I won't feel it because
I'll be dead from exposure.

30:26.366 --> 30:29.995
Um...

30:29.995 --> 30:31.413
Are there any pencils?

30:31.413 --> 30:32.539
Oh. [laughs]

30:32.539 --> 30:33.873
Sorry.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.208
I was using the pencil.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.627
Here.

30:36.627 --> 30:38.295
"The" pencil?

30:38.295 --> 30:39.879
Well, you only write
with one hand.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.007
[sighs] I'm afraid to ask,

30:42.007 --> 30:43.258
but is there any paper?

30:43.258 --> 30:46.386
Yes, of course
there's paper, silly.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.722
You can't run an office
without paper.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.644
Just write small
and use both sides.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.273
[♪♪♪]

31:02.736 --> 31:03.903
[gasps]

31:03.903 --> 31:06.490
How did you get it?

31:06.490 --> 31:08.241
I merely helped
the gentleman see reason.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.744
Did you need to use force?

31:10.744 --> 31:11.911
Simple persuasion.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.456
Oh. Too bad.
[chuckles]

31:15.708 --> 31:16.834
Bill...

31:16.834 --> 31:18.126
I would have paid for this.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.754
Oh, no, no, no.
I won't accept that.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.548
Why not?

31:22.548 --> 31:23.923
It took
time and effort.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.217
You need to be
compensated for that.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.926
Well, that's very kind of you,

31:26.926 --> 31:28.970
but helping a neighbor--

31:28.970 --> 31:32.182
and taking the smirk
off a crook's face--

31:32.182 --> 31:34.100
it's more than
enough reward for me.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.941
[Rosemary] Penny for a pencil?
That's ridiculous.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.819
It's highway robbery.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.366
A penny for a pencil seems
pretty reasonable, Rosemary.

31:49.366 --> 31:50.950
Well, not if you need 10.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.952
That's 10 pennies.
A whole dime!

31:52.952 --> 31:53.953
And?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.372
Well, not everybody
has a dime.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.415
[throws pencils in basket]

31:56.415 --> 31:57.999
Rosemary,
is everything all right?

31:57.999 --> 31:58.958
Everything is just fine.

31:58.958 --> 32:00.753
Rosemary.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.713
All right. No.
No, it isn't fine.

32:02.713 --> 32:03.963
It is not fine at all.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.131
Do you want to tell me
what this is all about?

32:08.385 --> 32:09.678
It's Lee.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.054
He doesn't want me
to know, but...

32:11.054 --> 32:13.891
[sighs] I'm afraid his business
is in terrible trouble.

32:13.891 --> 32:14.974
The sawmill?

32:14.974 --> 32:16.518
You must promise me
not to say a word,

32:16.518 --> 32:17.519
not to anybody.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.812
My lips are sealed.

32:18.812 --> 32:21.273
I'm helping Lee economize,

32:21.273 --> 32:22.775
trim the fat,
tighten our belts...

32:23.817 --> 32:25.151
But when I total it all up,

32:25.151 --> 32:27.070
it's not nearly enough
to make a difference. [gasps]

32:27.070 --> 32:28.697
There's a thought.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.365
I could divide up his office,
rent half of it out.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.408
I just have to
put in a second door.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.785
Rosemary.

32:32.785 --> 32:33.993
I don't have
an advice column,

32:33.993 --> 32:35.495
but I think it's time
you had a talk with Lee.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.496
Tell him
how worried you are.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.748
Oh, no, no.
I couldn't do that.

32:37.748 --> 32:38.540
Why not?

32:38.540 --> 32:39.999
Because I just can't!

32:39.999 --> 32:41.209
Yes, you can!

32:41.209 --> 32:42.502
Didn't you write a column
about the importance

32:42.502 --> 32:44.713
of communication
between two people?

32:44.713 --> 32:47.006
Well...
sounds vaguely familiar.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.425
So just go do it.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.009
-But--
-No buts.

32:50.009 --> 32:52.512
Just go. Now!

33:13.784 --> 33:16.244
"Time to keep silence...

33:16.244 --> 33:18.664
and a time to speak."

33:19.957 --> 33:22.835
"A time to search,
and a time to give up as lost."

33:22.835 --> 33:25.086
Obviously, you're not lost,
because I found you.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.881
You planning on
keeping me company

33:27.881 --> 33:29.716
on my ride to San Francisco?

33:29.716 --> 33:32.344
No. I plan on taking you
back to Hope Valley--

33:32.344 --> 33:33.595
because the people there

33:33.595 --> 33:35.388
deserve to be told
the whole story.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.015
They don't want to hear it.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.058
I'm a danger to them,

33:39.058 --> 33:40.435
an outlaw.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.103
You were an outlaw.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.229
Abigail,

33:43.229 --> 33:45.607
I am trying to protect them.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.317
Trying to protect you.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.902
Maybe we don't need protecting.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.070
If anything happens...

33:51.070 --> 33:53.072
We face it together,
as a community,

33:53.072 --> 33:55.408
because that's who we are
in Hope Valley.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.661
The town needs
to hear from you, Frank,

33:57.661 --> 33:59.705
even if
it's just goodbye.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.123
You owe us
that much at least.

34:16.847 --> 34:19.349
I owe you all an apology.

34:21.100 --> 34:25.480
You welcomed me in,
you took me into your hearts.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.316
I should've trusted you
with the truth.

34:28.316 --> 34:31.277
Instead, I dragged out the lie.

34:36.867 --> 34:39.786
They say the measure of a man
isn't by his mistakes,

34:39.786 --> 34:42.873
but by what he learns from them.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.503
Matt Landry is dead.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.130
He made plenty of mistakes.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.343
He did some terrible things,
there's no denying it,

34:55.343 --> 35:00.098
but without Matt Landry,
there would be no Frank Hogan.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.143
His...

35:04.143 --> 35:06.145
anger

35:06.145 --> 35:08.398
taught me kindness.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.068
His greed...

35:12.151 --> 35:14.362
taught me generosity.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.280
His indifference...

35:17.824 --> 35:19.284
taught me compassion.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.705
Now, I don't expect you
to forgive me...

35:24.790 --> 35:27.918
but I do hope you'll remember me
the way you knew me--

35:30.587 --> 35:33.131
as the man
you called your pastor...

35:34.758 --> 35:37.010
and your friend.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.933
Thanks, everybody, for coming.
I really appreciate it.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.392
You're not leaving.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.813
Not without a vote.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.440
This is a democracy.

35:51.608 --> 35:54.193

36:42.617 --> 36:44.077
[hushed] Remember.

36:44.077 --> 36:46.038
You didn't dodge
a bullet in there.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.206
I shoved you
out of the way.

Now that you're
a woman of means,

36:50.750 --> 36:52.251
what are your plans?

36:52.251 --> 36:53.670
This may
sound silly,

36:53.670 --> 36:55.505

dreamed of opening up

36:55.505 --> 36:57.632
a dress shop.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.258
That doesn't sound
silly at all.

36:59.258 --> 37:01.260
I'm sure it would
be a success.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.428
And what about you?

37:02.428 --> 37:04.806
Have you made up your mind
about the Pinkerton Agency?

37:04.806 --> 37:06.933
Not yet.
It's a nice offer, but--

37:06.933 --> 37:08.267
But you're
an unconventional man

37:08.267 --> 37:10.854
who might not be happy
in a conventional job.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.231
Here's a thought.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.234
Have you ever considered going
into business for yourself?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.277
Well, I am part owner
of Abigail's Cafe,

37:18.277 --> 37:19.071
may I remind you?

37:19.071 --> 37:22.824
I mean a business
of your own.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.829
Bill?

37:27.829 --> 37:30.707
I found your friend's

She owns a homestead
just outside

37:31.875 --> 37:33.877

37:35.378 --> 37:38.006
Appreciate that, Jack.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.300
No more secrets.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.802
To new beginnings.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.555
I'm glad you didn't die

38:08.995 --> 38:12.958
Lee, you don't have to put

38:13.917 --> 38:16.128
I know about

Financial problems?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.757
What financial problems?
I'm doing fine.

38:20.757 --> 38:23.009
Oh, come on.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.386
You can be
honest with me.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.430
I am being completely honest.

38:27.430 --> 38:31.309
What about the overdue
account at the mercantile?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.351
It's been
taken care of.

38:32.351 --> 38:33.352
It has?

38:33.352 --> 38:34.813
Yeah!

38:34.813 --> 38:36.397
The bill was just under
all the paperwork on my desk,

38:36.397 --> 38:37.607
just like I told you it was.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.445
But I know
about the loan!

38:42.445 --> 38:44.656
The loan?

38:44.656 --> 38:45.907
Oh! Well, yeah,

38:45.907 --> 38:47.366
I'm applying for a loan

38:50.369 --> 38:51.871
Wait a minute.

Is that is what all
the cost-cutting is about?

38:53.498 --> 38:54.666
You-- You...

38:54.666 --> 38:56.375
You think I'm going broke?

need a theater right now.

-Oh--
-Yes.

With the thrift plan

Just my clumsy way

40:29.468 --> 40:31.429
of attempting to be

40:32.471 --> 40:34.307
But you are.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.725
You are a part of my life.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.272
You're the best
part of my life.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.277

40:55.120 --> 40:57.538
Chicken's in the oven.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.457
And the wine
is poured.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.503
The place looks great.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.423
So do you.

41:06.423 --> 41:08.549
Why, Constable,
you make me blush.

41:08.549 --> 41:11.386
I want to make a toast,
to your decorating skills.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.888
It still
isn't the Ritz.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.558
No, but they say
"Home is where the heart is."

41:18.768 --> 41:21.479
Then my home
is right here.
