00:01.067 --> 00:03.833
(bright chiming)

00:07.900 --> 00:09.067
(car beeping)

00:09.067 --> 00:11.867
(upbeat music)

00:11.867 --> 00:13.033
* Come on home

00:13.033 --> 00:14.500
* Coming home baby now

00:14.500 --> 00:15.967
* You know I'm
waiting here for you *

00:15.967 --> 00:18.567
* I'm coming home
now, real soon *

00:18.567 --> 00:19.500
* You've been gone

00:19.500 --> 00:21.000
* Coming home baby now

00:21.000 --> 00:22.700
* You don't know
what I'm gonna do *

00:22.700 --> 00:24.967
* I'm coming home,
I know I'm overdue *

00:24.967 --> 00:26.267
* Since you went away

00:26.267 --> 00:28.200
* Expect me any day now

00:28.200 --> 00:29.467
* Real soon

00:29.467 --> 00:31.800
* I'm coming home and
never more to roam *

00:31.800 --> 00:33.200
* Baby tell me you'll

00:33.200 --> 00:37.967
* Baby I'm for
sure coming home *

00:37.967 --> 00:39.000
* I'm coming home

00:39.000 --> 00:40.400
* Come on home

00:40.400 --> 00:42.933
(upbeat music)

00:46.233 --> 00:47.600
- Why do you belong

00:47.600 --> 00:49.200
on the board of International
Women of Medicine?

00:49.200 --> 00:52.433
- Well, I did hear that the
last delegation to New York

00:52.433 --> 00:54.233
got to go backstage at
the Beyonce concert,

00:54.233 --> 00:55.800
and I love Beyonce, so...

00:59.133 --> 01:02.100
Jokes aside, I
think that the IWM

01:02.100 --> 01:04.533
is such a powerful organization,

01:04.533 --> 01:06.667
connecting women from
all over the world

01:06.667 --> 01:08.467
to share and study and practice,

01:08.467 --> 01:10.667
and, just to be clear, I'm
not even that keen on Beyonce

01:10.667 --> 01:12.667
'cause I think she posts
too many photos to Instagram

01:12.667 --> 01:14.700
of her and Jay Z
on their yacht...

01:14.700 --> 01:18.367
- Our organization aims to lift
the lives of women globally

01:18.367 --> 01:19.933
in all areas of
medicine, naturally,

01:19.933 --> 01:21.200
but also through education.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.433
- Which is what I admire.

01:22.433 --> 01:24.600
- How do you lift
the lives of women?

01:25.500 --> 01:26.333
- Oh, me?

01:26.333 --> 01:27.567
I, well, I...

01:28.667 --> 01:31.833
Not so much globally
at the moment.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.067
- Then what's the impact

01:33.067 --> 01:34.767
of your local charity
work on others?

01:34.767 --> 01:37.600
- Well, I do a lot
of pro bono work and,

01:37.600 --> 01:41.300
um, obviously work here
at the public hospital.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.500
Both of which are
heavily subsidized

01:44.500 --> 01:45.733
by your private practice.

01:47.633 --> 01:51.167
We're trying to understand how
you are socially inclusive.

01:51.167 --> 01:51.967
- Of course.

01:53.867 --> 01:56.267
- Can you share which
IWM-supported charities

01:56.267 --> 01:58.067
you're involved with?

01:58.067 --> 02:01.867
- Ah, um, which ones are those?

02:01.867 --> 02:03.967
- Let Girls Learn,
Do it in a Dress,

02:03.967 --> 02:05.500
The Smith Family, Women of-

02:05.500 --> 02:06.967
- Ah!

02:06.967 --> 02:09.500
Yes, well, right now, I'm mainly
involved in Bikes 4 Babies.

02:11.667 --> 02:14.100
- Oh, that's not an
IWM-recognized...

02:14.100 --> 02:16.733
- No, it isn't, no,
but it is to support

02:16.733 --> 02:19.767
our neonatal
intensive care unit.

02:19.767 --> 02:23.067
Which, obviously, is
a charity right here.

02:24.233 --> 02:25.133
And right here.

02:27.367 --> 02:29.600
- So you're doing a bike ride?

02:29.600 --> 02:30.833
Yes, I am.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.233
Yep.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.500
With my family.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.467
My husband and kids, they-

02:34.467 --> 02:35.733
- I think that's everything.

02:35.733 --> 02:36.933
- Yeah, okay.

02:36.933 --> 02:39.533
(upbeat music)

02:41.733 --> 02:43.500
- What do you mean
you didn't get it?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.200
- She hated me!

02:45.200 --> 02:46.067
- Who?

02:46.067 --> 02:47.800
- Clara Rubenstein.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.833
- Never heard of her.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.167
- She's a big deal, Mum.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.067
She's friends with
Michelle Obama.

02:52.067 --> 02:54.167
- That woman's
arms are overrated!

02:54.167 --> 02:57.067
- She didn't think that I was
socially inclusive enough.

02:57.067 --> 02:58.300
Maybe I'm not.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.733
- You're lovely at a party,

02:59.733 --> 03:01.067
you're the first
to offer a drink

03:01.067 --> 03:02.800
and you bring those
yummy prawn balls.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.100
- Not that kind of
social inclusion!

03:05.100 --> 03:06.167
Put the sugar down, Mum!

03:06.167 --> 03:07.500
- I'm upset.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.067
I told Pat from View Club

03:09.067 --> 03:11.733
you being on the IWM board
was a foregone conclusion.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.133
- Well, you shouldn't have!

03:13.133 --> 03:16.200
Anyway, that's not
why I asked you here.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.600
I wanted to talk
about Mother's Day.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.067
- So did I!

03:20.067 --> 03:22.833
I thought this year, we
could skip the high tea.

03:22.833 --> 03:23.833
- It's Julie's turn.

03:24.767 --> 03:25.733
- Julie doesn't get a turn.

03:25.733 --> 03:26.700
I get all the turns.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.067
- Julie just wants to celebrate

03:28.067 --> 03:30.067
one Mother's Day with me, Mum.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.567
- Mother's Day is a reward

03:31.567 --> 03:33.100
for all the hours
you have put in.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.600
Julie hasn't put any hours in.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.100
Why does she get a reward?

03:36.100 --> 03:37.800
- She gets a reward for
giving you the opportunity

03:37.800 --> 03:39.067
to be a mother at all.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.200
You can come too.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.833
But we're going to Julie's.

03:41.833 --> 03:42.700
Have some sugar.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.833
(upbeat music)

03:56.433 --> 03:59.067
- You should probably
go before Shawn gets up.

03:59.067 --> 03:59.800
- [Shawn] Ahem.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.633
- Don't sneak up on us.

04:03.633 --> 04:04.733
- Yeah, that's what happened.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.067
- Okay, I should go.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.700
When can we catch
up on the weekend?

04:07.700 --> 04:09.833
I've got to repaint the girls'
toilet block on Saturday

04:09.833 --> 04:13.167
and (groans) beg for
the school on Sunday

04:13.167 --> 04:15.333
at the Mitre 10 Sausage Sizzle.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.800
I could come and help beg.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.900
- Really?

04:18.900 --> 04:19.700
- Really?

04:21.067 --> 04:22.133
- I love volunteering.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.700
- Need a lift to school, Shawn?

04:29.067 --> 04:30.167
Yeah, that'd be weird.

04:33.100 --> 04:33.933
Bye.
- Bye.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.067
- So, it's going well, then?

04:41.067 --> 04:42.333
- What is?

04:42.333 --> 04:43.800
- You going out with
my school principal.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.933
Or are we still pretending
it's not happening?

04:45.933 --> 04:48.200
- Does it look like
I'm pretending?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.167
- You haven't told Nan and Pop.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.333
- I just want to get
to know Evan on my own,

04:52.333 --> 04:53.433
before Dad orders him

04:53.433 --> 04:55.167
a World's Best
Son-in-Law stubby holder

04:55.167 --> 04:57.400
and Brianna gets his family
sticker made up for the car.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.767
- But you're gonna
have to tell them-

04:58.767 --> 05:00.100
- No.

05:00.100 --> 05:00.733
- Why you're doing
a sausage sizzle.

05:00.733 --> 05:01.533
- No.

05:01.533 --> 05:02.467
- On Mother's Day.

05:03.567 --> 05:06.300
(Amber exclaims)

05:11.633 --> 05:13.833
- What do you mean
you can't come?

05:13.833 --> 05:16.400
Bess is telling
Margaret it's my turn

05:16.400 --> 05:18.967
and I want all my
children together!

05:18.967 --> 05:20.300
- What is so important?

05:20.300 --> 05:21.967
We've hardly even
seen you lately.

05:21.967 --> 05:23.067
- Howdy, stranger!

05:23.067 --> 05:23.933
- See?

05:23.933 --> 05:25.400
Dad's really upset with you.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.267
- No, I'm not.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.500
Am I?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.267
- She's not coming
to Mother's Day.

05:29.267 --> 05:30.433
- What happened?

05:30.433 --> 05:31.367
- Do you know we're
having a spit?

05:31.367 --> 05:33.200
It's not for jumping, Younis!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.633
- Why can't it be multipurpose?

05:34.633 --> 05:37.367
- What could be more
important than this?

05:37.367 --> 05:39.967
- I promised I would help out
at the Mitre 10 Sausage Sizzle

05:39.967 --> 05:40.967
for Shawn's school.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.633
You know, to raise money.

05:46.733 --> 05:47.933
Because they're under-resourced

05:47.933 --> 05:49.933
and they rely on
the parents to help.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.533
- Amber, what's really going on?

05:52.667 --> 05:53.933
- Is it so unbelievable
I'd be volunteering

05:53.933 --> 05:55.700
on a sausage sizzle?

05:55.700 --> 05:57.167
- [Family] Yeah.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.600
(Amber sighs)

05:58.600 --> 06:00.067
- She's dating someone.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.067
- Shawn!

06:01.067 --> 06:02.867
- They were gonna find out.

06:02.867 --> 06:04.067
- You're dating someone?

06:04.067 --> 06:05.400
- From Mitre 10?

06:05.400 --> 06:06.500
- Is it Mickey?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.667
From Outdoor Living?

06:07.667 --> 06:08.500
He's awesome!

06:08.500 --> 06:09.333
Isn't he, Dad?

06:09.333 --> 06:10.400
- Is it Mickey? Is it?

06:10.400 --> 06:11.800
'Cause I would be very proud

06:11.800 --> 06:13.633
to give Mickey a
son-in-law stubby holder.

06:13.633 --> 06:14.867
- [Julie] Which one is he?

06:14.867 --> 06:15.900
- Has he been in
one of their ads?

06:15.900 --> 06:17.167
- Does he work out?

06:17.167 --> 06:18.133
- He's the tall guy
with the blond hair.

06:18.133 --> 06:19.800
Would you call it blond, Kayne?

06:19.800 --> 06:20.900
- Yeah, I would.

06:20.900 --> 06:21.967
- A natural blond.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.433
Imagine their kids.

06:23.433 --> 06:24.867
Mum, we need to ask him
over so I can see his hair.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.133
- When's he free, Amber?

06:26.133 --> 06:28.533
- I don't know who
fucking Mickey is!

06:28.533 --> 06:29.767
- Then who are you dating?

06:29.767 --> 06:31.500
- I'm not gonna
tell you anything,

06:31.500 --> 06:35.633
unless you all promise
not to do this.

06:35.633 --> 06:38.633
It's very early days and I
just want to get to know him

06:38.633 --> 06:41.267
on my own, without you
calling him your son-in-law.

06:41.267 --> 06:45.167
You have to let me introduce
you when I am ready, okay?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.133
- His name's Evan.

06:49.133 --> 06:50.167
- From Lighting and Electrical!

06:50.167 --> 06:51.133
- With the tatts!

06:51.133 --> 06:52.067
He's incredible!

06:52.067 --> 06:53.167
- That's it!

06:53.167 --> 06:54.800
- Aw Amber.
- Aw come on, Amber.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.633
- You can tell.
- Aw come on.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.200
(upbeat music)

07:05.633 --> 07:07.300
- Hey, ganggajang!

07:07.300 --> 07:08.533
What's that?

07:08.533 --> 07:10.467
You want to hear the
dopest plan ever?

07:10.467 --> 07:11.567
Okay.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.800
We, you and you and me,

07:13.800 --> 07:18.800
are gonna hit all the cafes
featured in "Hot Urban Eats".

07:19.733 --> 07:20.567
No, don't eat.

07:20.567 --> 07:21.567
Oscar. Oscar.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.800
Don't eat! Don't eat!

07:22.800 --> 07:24.133
We're gonna go out.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.067
- I don't want to.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.200
- Yes, you do.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.067
See, we're gonna
do this every week!

07:28.067 --> 07:30.733
We're gonna work our way
through all the smashed avos

07:30.733 --> 07:34.067
on both sides of the river,
'cause I love this side of town

07:34.067 --> 07:35.833
but sometimes I get FOMO

07:35.833 --> 07:38.200
about the buzz on the
other side of town.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.533
- I have too much homework.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.333
- Okay, okay, we'll
go somewhere local.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.300
Where do you want to go?

07:44.300 --> 07:45.333
- To my room.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.500
- No, that's too local.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.300
Come on!

07:49.300 --> 07:51.900
Let's... okay.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.433
Hey?

07:53.433 --> 07:55.100
You guys never want to do
anything with me anymore!

07:55.100 --> 07:56.933
You don't want to play Frisbee,

07:56.933 --> 07:58.500
you don't want to do Dubsmash,

07:58.500 --> 08:01.133
you don't answer any of
my snaps on Snapchat!

08:01.133 --> 08:02.067
- Of course, of course!

08:02.067 --> 08:04.433
That sounds incredible!

08:04.433 --> 08:05.367
Yes, yes!

08:05.367 --> 08:06.700
I'll definitely be there.

08:07.933 --> 08:08.867
Yeah.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.300
No, I completely understand.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.233
- [Woman On Phone]
It'll be the only chance

08:11.233 --> 08:12.667
that the rest of the IWM board

08:12.667 --> 08:15.067
will have to meet the
shortlisted candidates.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.500
I realize it's an imposition

08:16.500 --> 08:18.867
since you have your
Bikes 4 Babies ride.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.367
- My what?

08:20.367 --> 08:21.833
- [Woman On Phone] For the
neonatal intensive care-

08:21.833 --> 08:22.800
- Oh, yes.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.633
No, of course.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.133
I can sort that.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.900
Yes, okay, okay.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.533
Bye-bye!

08:28.533 --> 08:31.767
Guess who's been shortlisted
for the IWM board?

08:31.767 --> 08:32.600
- Katy Perry.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.500
- Not a doctor.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.333
- You.
- Yes!

08:34.333 --> 08:35.600
- Oh, so proud!

08:38.300 --> 08:40.967
- They've invited me to the
IWM Mother's Day luncheon.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.200
Do you know what this means?
- .

08:42.200 --> 08:44.133
- I have a chance
not to be an idiot.

08:44.133 --> 08:45.767
- Oh, baby, shoot for the stars.

08:46.967 --> 08:49.800
Actually, what is the
Bikes 4 Babies thing?

08:49.800 --> 08:54.333
- Oh, I panicked in the
interview and I said that you,

08:54.333 --> 08:56.267
the kids and I would
do a charity bike ride

08:56.267 --> 08:57.733
for the hospital on Sunday.

08:57.733 --> 08:58.633
- Actually?

08:58.633 --> 09:00.167
- Yes, I'm so sorry...

09:00.167 --> 09:02.300
- No, no, no, is it actually
a thing, Bikes 4 Babies?

09:02.300 --> 09:03.100
- Yes.

09:03.100 --> 09:04.067
- Got 'em.

09:04.067 --> 09:04.800
Got who?

09:04.800 --> 09:06.500
- Me and Oscar and Eddie

09:06.500 --> 09:08.133
are going on a bike
ride this weekend.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.500
It's for sick babies
so they can't say no.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.633
(growls)

09:12.633 --> 09:14.700
You're my International
Woman of Medicine.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.500
Oh, hang on.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.333
Mother's Day.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.600
Lunch.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.900
I thought you were doing
Mother's Day with Julie.

09:18.900 --> 09:19.800
Oh...

09:21.100 --> 09:22.067
Uh...

09:22.067 --> 09:24.200
(upbeat music)

09:24.200 --> 09:25.900
Are you sure it's
okay to be here?

09:25.900 --> 09:27.533
Is the rest of the
family all right?

09:27.533 --> 09:28.367
- Of course!

09:28.367 --> 09:30.200
This is amazing!

09:30.200 --> 09:31.633
Amber's with Evan anyway

09:31.633 --> 09:34.333
and I want you to get
backstage at Beyonce.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.533
- Shh!

09:35.533 --> 09:36.833
We're not focusing on that.

09:36.833 --> 09:40.233
- Plus I get to be your
mother on Mother's Day.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.800
With Margaret.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.933
- Why do both our name tags say
"Mother of Dr. Bess Denyar"?

09:47.933 --> 09:49.700
- Because you are
both my mothers.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.200
- I don't see why you have
to announce it in print.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.733
- Is there a press
release to follow?

09:52.733 --> 09:54.833
- Mum, please don't
start an argument.

09:54.833 --> 09:57.100
You want me to be on the
board of the IWM, don't you?

09:57.100 --> 09:59.833
- Just don't embark on
our whole life story.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.067
No one needs to know
the ins and outs.

10:02.067 --> 10:04.567
- I promise I won't reveal
any of the sordid details

10:04.567 --> 10:05.500
of our grubby little lives.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.800
(Julie laughing)

10:06.800 --> 10:08.600
Why don't you check
out the silent auction

10:08.600 --> 10:10.100
and I will get us some drinks.

10:11.033 --> 10:14.133
(sizzling)

10:14.133 --> 10:15.433
- Are you gonna be okay?

10:15.433 --> 10:17.400
I feel a bit bad
leaving you on your own.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.867
- I'm fine.

10:18.867 --> 10:21.467
I think, Amber, you okay
to stay for a little while?

10:21.467 --> 10:23.533
- Yeah, I can manage
the next shift.

10:23.533 --> 10:24.367
- [Evan] Thank you, Sonia.

10:24.367 --> 10:25.333
Thank you, Graeme.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.200
- Thanks, guys. See ya.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.033
- See ya.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.533
- I could not hold
out any longer.

10:35.533 --> 10:37.100
- Slowest two hours of my life.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.900
- Is that Amber?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.800
That's right, you said
you'd be here today!

10:42.800 --> 10:43.767
- She did too!

10:43.767 --> 10:46.767
- At the sausage sizzle, yes.

10:46.767 --> 10:47.867
- Hey, Shawn.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.133
- Hi, Mr. Janko.

10:49.133 --> 10:49.967
- Oh, you know each
other, do you, Shawn?

10:49.967 --> 10:51.367
- You are pathetic.

10:51.367 --> 10:52.667
- No!

10:52.667 --> 10:54.133
We just popped down to
pick up a few supplies

10:54.133 --> 10:55.367
and we forgot you'd
be here with...

10:55.367 --> 10:56.333
Who was it again, Shawnie?

10:56.333 --> 10:57.867
Mr. Janko?

10:57.867 --> 10:59.433
- Who we don't even know is
the high school principal!

10:59.433 --> 11:01.067
- No.
- Oh, my God.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.300
Evan, this is my dad, Wayne,

11:03.300 --> 11:05.233
my sister Brianna,
her fiancé Younis

11:05.233 --> 11:07.067
and my half-brother, Kayne.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.367
- I'm not her half-brother!

11:09.433 --> 11:10.267
Am I?

11:10.267 --> 11:11.167
- So, Evan, how do you?

11:11.167 --> 11:13.067
- Nope! That's it.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.700
Go and buy your supplies.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.633
- Amber, they are
actual supplies.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.867
We need to grab a few things

11:18.867 --> 11:20.567
for the spit we're
having tonight.

11:20.567 --> 11:21.833
- So, Evan, if you're
free, you could-

11:21.833 --> 11:23.067
- Dad!

11:23.067 --> 11:24.500
Go!

11:24.500 --> 11:25.367
- Okay.

11:25.367 --> 11:26.333
We're going.

11:26.333 --> 11:28.900
(upbeat music)

11:34.267 --> 11:36.200
- How great is this?

11:36.200 --> 11:39.500
I know you guys weren't
keen but this is da bomb!

11:39.500 --> 11:41.067
Bikes 4 Babies?

11:41.067 --> 11:43.133
More like Bikes for Cool Dads
and Kids, am I right, guys?

11:44.067 --> 11:44.867
Hey!

11:49.733 --> 11:51.433
- Excuse me!

11:51.433 --> 11:53.767
Oh, Dr. Rubenstein, hello.

11:53.767 --> 11:54.633
- Dr. Denyar.

11:54.633 --> 11:55.733
Which table are you at?

11:55.733 --> 11:57.867
- Uh, I think I'm on table four.

11:57.867 --> 11:58.667
Which charity?

12:00.400 --> 12:03.967
Every table is assigned to
an IWM-supported charity

12:03.967 --> 12:05.733
to which the funds
are going today.

12:05.733 --> 12:06.767
- Yes, of course.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.900
I know.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.800
And my charity is, is-

12:09.800 --> 12:11.533
- [Woman] Clara!

12:11.533 --> 12:13.800
- I'll bring Dr. Wang,
the chair of the board,

12:13.800 --> 12:14.633
over to meet you.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.533
- Oh!

12:15.533 --> 12:17.367
- Thank you so much.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.967
Listen, I've got an interesting.

12:26.367 --> 12:29.467
- The Smith Family
Learning for Life.

12:34.933 --> 12:36.900
Does your mum work
for The Smith Family?

12:38.133 --> 12:38.967
Is she a doctor?

12:40.533 --> 12:41.867
Then why are you here?

12:41.867 --> 12:43.500
- I'm part of their programs.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.533
- What do you mean?
What's Learning for Life?

12:45.533 --> 12:47.100
Quickly, quickly!

12:47.100 --> 12:50.133
- Well, this lady called Erica
and this man called Mike,

12:50.133 --> 12:52.133
they help my mum pay
for me to go to school.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.067
- Yep. Yep.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.100
That's it?

12:55.100 --> 12:55.933
They pay for you
to go to school?

12:55.933 --> 12:56.767
- Yeah.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.200
- Private school?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.067
Then what do they pay for?

13:00.067 --> 13:01.067
Nuh-uh-uh!

13:01.067 --> 13:01.800
You can have that in a minute!

13:01.800 --> 13:03.300
What do they pay for?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.567
- They pay for stuff like
my shoes and my bags...

13:05.567 --> 13:06.400
- Oh, okay, got it.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.233
- And excursions.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.633
- Yep, okay.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.367
- And I do reading,
because, before, I couldn't.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.433
- Okay, and now you can read.

13:11.433 --> 13:12.267
Shh!

13:13.533 --> 13:15.300
- Natalie Wang, Bess Denyar.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.333
- Oh, Dr. Wang.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.333
It is an honor to meet you.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.933
- And this is...?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.200
- This is...

13:21.200 --> 13:22.667
- Evie.
- Evie.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.333
- Hi, Evie.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.500
- Evie's part of The
Smith Family programs,

13:26.500 --> 13:29.600
the Learning for Life
and the reading one.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.067
We're very glad to
have you here, Evie.

13:32.067 --> 13:34.167
- The statistics are just
extraordinary, aren't they?

13:34.167 --> 13:37.167
- (laughing) Extraordinary!

13:37.167 --> 13:39.400
- The statistics about
education and poverty.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.567
- Amazing!

13:40.567 --> 13:42.067
Unfortunately.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.067
- Well, not really.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.167
- No!

13:45.167 --> 13:48.367
No, actually,
because education is-

13:48.367 --> 13:50.267
- The only thing that
breaks the poverty cycle.

13:50.267 --> 13:51.500
- Exactly.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.900
Mum.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.667
This is my mother, Margaret.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.667
This is Dr. Wang
and Dr. Rubenstein.

13:56.667 --> 13:57.933
- Hello.

13:57.933 --> 14:00.433
I do so admire the
work of the IWM.

14:00.433 --> 14:03.167
- I've got eight things on
the go in the silent auction.

14:03.167 --> 14:04.400
I don't want any of it

14:04.400 --> 14:06.900
but it's always good
to jack up the prices!

14:06.900 --> 14:10.167
- Uh, this is my
other mother, Julie.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.233
- Your other mother?

14:12.233 --> 14:13.067
- Yep.

14:13.067 --> 14:13.900
I have two mothers.

14:14.933 --> 14:15.767
That's all.

14:15.767 --> 14:16.733
No story.

14:16.733 --> 14:17.767
- Right.

14:17.767 --> 14:19.233
Listen up, you two.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.667
You need Bess on your board,
so where does she sign?

14:22.067 --> 14:23.533
- Go on, Marg. Tell them.

14:23.533 --> 14:26.300
- Your champagne
is getting warm.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.233
- You didn't mention your
upbringing in your interview.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.500
- No, no, I didn't
think that it mattered.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.933
- Well, of course not, but
we're trying to ascertain

14:33.933 --> 14:35.633
your understanding
of social inclusion.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.133
- Yeah.

14:37.133 --> 14:39.467
So it's hugely significant
to have lesbian parents.

14:39.467 --> 14:40.700
(Margaret sputters)

14:40.700 --> 14:43.500
I think I may have
changed my vote.

14:43.500 --> 14:47.400
(easy going comical music)

14:47.400 --> 14:49.167
- [Wayne] How's
it looking, Kayne?

14:49.167 --> 14:50.300
- Got her.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.233
- No, that's a
normal-sized sausage.

14:53.233 --> 14:55.067
- Kayne, we need intel!

14:55.067 --> 14:55.967
- Guys!

14:55.967 --> 14:57.333
You shouldn't be spying on them!

14:57.333 --> 14:58.567
- You shouldn't
have your feet up

14:58.567 --> 15:00.100
on that beautiful
wicker papasan!

15:00.100 --> 15:02.600
- And how big do you think
your sausage should be for $2?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.167
What do you want,
a fucking kranski?

15:04.167 --> 15:05.433
- Uh-oh, she's...

15:05.433 --> 15:06.267
- She's what?

15:07.367 --> 15:09.500
- She's being herself.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.067
(upbeat music)

15:17.467 --> 15:18.700
- Morning!

15:18.700 --> 15:21.067
- You've passed, like,
100 bikes in 10 minutes.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.067
- We've passed, like, six.

15:22.067 --> 15:22.867
It's still impressive.

15:22.867 --> 15:23.700
- Admit it!

15:23.700 --> 15:24.533
It's the best, right?

15:24.533 --> 15:25.733
- It's pretty fun.

15:25.733 --> 15:27.233
- Maybe we should
keep the tandem, Dad.

15:27.233 --> 15:28.500
- Maybe!

15:28.500 --> 15:29.900
Smell the country air,
endorphins kicking in.

15:29.900 --> 15:30.733
It's uplifting.

15:30.733 --> 15:31.733
Ow, ow, ow, stop.

15:31.733 --> 15:32.600
Stop the bike!

15:32.600 --> 15:34.100
Stop, stop, ow, ow.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.233
Ow, ow, ow.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.433
Ah, ah, ah.

15:36.433 --> 15:37.267
- [Edwina] What is it, Dad?

15:37.267 --> 15:38.267
- Is it your leg?

15:38.267 --> 15:39.300
- Is it cramping?

15:39.300 --> 15:40.233
- Ow.
- I can rub it out.

15:40.233 --> 15:41.467
- No, no, no, don't touch it!

15:41.467 --> 15:42.367
Don't touch it.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.367
I've torn it!

15:43.367 --> 15:44.600
I've torn a calf muscle!

15:44.600 --> 15:46.067
I'm sorry, guys!
- Dad, it's okay.

15:46.067 --> 15:48.467
Okay, you get on the middle
seat, and we'll do the cycling.

15:48.467 --> 15:49.300
Put your leg up.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.233
- Really? You sure?

15:50.233 --> 15:51.900
- I'm not you're really heavy!

15:51.900 --> 15:52.967
- Of course we're sure.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.067
- Come on! Climb on!

15:54.067 --> 15:55.067
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

15:55.067 --> 15:55.967
We're gonna lose our spot!

15:55.967 --> 15:56.867
- Come on.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.367
- Okay, okay.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.100
Okay, okay, okay.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.067
Ah, ah, ah.

16:01.067 --> 16:05.333
- (laughing) Oh, dear, yes.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.900
- We've got to say something.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.100
- You heard what she said.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.600
She's gonna vote for
Bess to be on the board

16:09.600 --> 16:10.700
because we're gay.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.667
- We're not!

16:11.667 --> 16:12.800
- She thinks we're gay.
- Shh!

16:12.800 --> 16:14.067
- You're very
defensive about this.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.133
Is there something
you want to tell me?

16:15.133 --> 16:16.567
I love this color on you,

16:16.567 --> 16:17.967
by the way.
- Stop it!

16:17.967 --> 16:18.800
- Excuse me.

16:20.367 --> 16:23.667
I just wanted to
say congratulations
on being pioneers.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.500
It can't have been
easy in your era.

16:26.867 --> 16:30.167
My partner and I, well,
she's pregnant at the moment.

16:30.167 --> 16:31.100
- [Julie] Oh!

16:31.100 --> 16:32.467
- Who is the biological mother?

16:32.467 --> 16:33.967
- I am.

16:33.967 --> 16:36.267
- And do you mind me asking
how that made you feel,

16:36.267 --> 16:37.900
not being the one who...?

16:39.300 --> 16:42.367
- You don't have to be "the
one who" to be a mother.

16:43.767 --> 16:45.067
The truth of the matter is.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.133
- The truth is Marg
is Bess's mother.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.067
I gave birth to Bess, but
Margaret was there when I wasn't

16:52.067 --> 16:55.500
and no one could love their
child more than she does.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.967
That's the absolute
truth, isn't it?

17:00.967 --> 17:01.800
- Well...

17:03.800 --> 17:05.067
Yes, I suppose it is.

17:06.867 --> 17:09.333
- You want to check out the
dessert table with me, Doctor?

17:11.433 --> 17:13.367
You want anything, babe?

17:16.733 --> 17:18.067
- I just can't believe
someone would quibble

17:18.067 --> 17:19.967
over the price of a sausage.

17:19.967 --> 17:22.067
- I know, but maybe
it's good for the school

17:22.067 --> 17:25.600
and also business if we
don't swear at the customers.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.400
If indeed we get
any more customers.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.467
- Excuse me!

17:28.467 --> 17:29.733
- Oh...

17:29.733 --> 17:31.367
- Could we have 15
sausages, please?

17:31.367 --> 17:32.733
- Piss off, Dad.

17:32.733 --> 17:35.367
- Amber, we're
very, very hungry.

17:35.367 --> 17:38.900
We've been up early working
hard on the spit for tonight.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.233
- Oh, for shit's sake.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.500
- Hey!

17:41.500 --> 17:43.367
How much is a sausage?

17:43.367 --> 17:44.967
- They're $2!

17:44.967 --> 17:45.833
- What?

17:45.833 --> 17:46.767
Only $2?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.633
- Oh.
- They smell so good!

17:49.633 --> 17:51.700
I'm getting one!

17:51.700 --> 17:53.400
- We're creating a buzz.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.467
- Demand equals supply.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.333
- Thank you, Alan Greenspan.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.800
- Are we making
up customer names?

17:58.800 --> 18:00.367
I don't like Alan.

18:00.367 --> 18:03.667
- Anyway, the point is we
need a lot of sausages.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.167
- Okay.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.267
- Yeah, retail's a funny thing.

18:07.267 --> 18:09.067
Not everyone's cut out for it.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.067
For instance, we
realized pretty early on

18:11.067 --> 18:12.900
after an incident
in the merch tent

18:12.900 --> 18:15.667
that Amber was not
front-of-house material.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.167
- Dad!

18:17.167 --> 18:18.700
- But after we popped her
in the back of the truck

18:18.700 --> 18:22.333
with a general ledger and
no people, she was magic.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.967
And that might be something
you want to think about, Evan.

18:24.967 --> 18:26.200
- Right, that's it.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.200
I am perfectly capable
of letting you know

18:28.200 --> 18:30.600
how difficult I am without
any help from my family.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.100
You have to tell them to leave.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.733
You need to do that I'm a
principal of a school thing

18:33.733 --> 18:36.067
and make them go before
they wreck everything.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.400
- Stop!

18:37.400 --> 18:38.333
Hi there!

18:38.333 --> 18:39.833
Would you like a sausage?

18:39.833 --> 18:41.233
- [Man] Oh, yes, please.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.900
- Two takeaways with
onions for the Toyota!

18:43.900 --> 18:45.800
- Two, takeaway,
onion, Toyota, go.

18:45.800 --> 18:46.900
Fantastic, okay.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.067
Do you want bread?
- Next.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.233
(horn honks)

18:49.233 --> 18:51.200
- I don't think I can
ask them to go away.

18:53.267 --> 18:55.667
- So, it's, like, hundreds
and hundreds of years later

18:55.667 --> 18:57.433
and the guys who are
now the Kings of Numenor

18:57.433 --> 18:58.733
find out that Sun
has been saying

18:58.733 --> 19:01.067
he's the lord of Old Mill Ur.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.600
And I honestly think
that because Copenhagen

19:02.600 --> 19:04.067
has 400-
- And basically

19:04.067 --> 19:05.533
it doesn't work.

19:05.533 --> 19:07.067
- And about half of the
population rides to work,

19:07.067 --> 19:09.067
I mean, surely that means
- But now that Numenor

19:09.067 --> 19:10.233
is destroyed.
- That they're

19:10.233 --> 19:11.433
100% renewable energy goal

19:11.433 --> 19:12.733
- Is also destroyed.
- Is totally achievable.

19:12.733 --> 19:13.567
- Kill me.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.067
Kill me!

19:15.067 --> 19:15.933
Actual, actual wind turbine.
- His spiritual body's

19:15.933 --> 19:17.367
actually returned to Mordor.

19:23.133 --> 19:23.967
- How are you going, Mum?

19:23.967 --> 19:25.467
- As well as anyone

19:25.467 --> 19:27.867
who's pretending to be a
lesbian for her daughter.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.700
(women laughing)

19:29.700 --> 19:31.200
Perhaps not as well as anyone.

19:32.633 --> 19:33.900
This wouldn't have happened

19:33.900 --> 19:35.467
if you didn't insist on
us sharing Mother's Day.

19:35.467 --> 19:36.700
- I'm sorry, Mum.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.500
- So, what do you
do on Father's Day?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.533
If you have two mums?

19:42.533 --> 19:44.133
- Those cakes look delicious!

19:44.133 --> 19:45.600
- Does one of you
get to be the father

19:45.600 --> 19:46.500
and one of you is the mother?

19:46.500 --> 19:47.667
- No, no.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.267
That's not how it works.

19:49.267 --> 19:51.567
Is that a tiny lemon tart?

19:51.567 --> 19:52.400
- Dr. Denyar?

19:54.300 --> 19:55.467
- Coming!

19:55.467 --> 19:56.800
You just focus on eating
those cakes, Evie.

19:56.800 --> 19:57.633
Yum!

20:00.967 --> 20:02.300
- She's a bit weird.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.667
- Yeah, she is a bit.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.133
- What about when she was a kid?

20:05.133 --> 20:06.867
- She was a bit weird then, too.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.200
- No, I mean, did
she have to buy

20:08.200 --> 20:10.033
two Mother's Day
presents every year?

20:11.033 --> 20:11.867
- No.

20:12.867 --> 20:13.700
- Did you share?

20:15.267 --> 20:16.633
- No.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.100
- Then who got the present?

20:19.267 --> 20:21.767
Did she have to make
two breakfasts in bed?

20:21.767 --> 20:23.367
- You're a sponsor child, right?

20:24.700 --> 20:26.700
Why don't I sponsor
you to stop talking?

20:28.867 --> 20:31.267
No, she didn't have to
make two breakfasts in bed.

20:31.267 --> 20:32.200
- Why not?

20:32.200 --> 20:34.233
- Because Julie wasn't there.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.200
- Did she work shift work?

20:35.200 --> 20:36.533
- Yes, she worked shift work.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.300
- Every Mother's Day?

20:40.300 --> 20:41.433
That's so unfair.

20:42.633 --> 20:44.433
She never got a
breakfast in bed.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.767
(upbeat music)

20:59.033 --> 21:02.067
- These sliders are a
stroke of genius, Younis.

21:02.067 --> 21:03.467
- It's all Brianna, man.

21:03.467 --> 21:05.633
She really gets the whole
food truck experience

21:05.633 --> 21:08.233
'cause they were at
Westfield for a while.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.433
- Well, I'm very
grateful, Brianna.

21:10.433 --> 21:11.267
- Love it!

21:12.333 --> 21:13.933
Two sliders for Brian.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.567
Come and get your
Korean barbecue!

21:17.933 --> 21:20.233
- Dad, I don't think this
barbecue is actually from Korea.

21:20.233 --> 21:21.933
I'm pretty sure it's from China.

21:21.933 --> 21:23.300
- It's the style
of cooking, mate.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.067
It's an ancient tradition.

21:25.067 --> 21:26.767
That's why we've
got the soy sauce.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.733
Amber, we've got a tray for you.

21:28.733 --> 21:29.567
Amber?

21:31.500 --> 21:33.367
Amber, can you take
over these sausages?

21:33.367 --> 21:35.067
- You know what you can
do with your sausages.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.533
- Oh, come on, love!

21:36.533 --> 21:38.067
- I knew you would do this!

21:38.067 --> 21:40.600
You would take him,
everything, over!

21:40.600 --> 21:41.867
- You're right.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.567
We shouldn't have
come down here.

21:43.567 --> 21:44.533
We should've left you two alone

21:44.533 --> 21:46.733
to run the sizzle by yourselves,

21:46.733 --> 21:49.300
to argue with customers
and to not make any money.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.400
- Give me the sausages.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.433
- Well, I got three phone
numbers, an Ellen T-shirt

21:59.433 --> 22:01.500
and an invitation
to Dykes on Bikes,

22:01.500 --> 22:03.667
which I think I'm actually
going to look into.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.133
Marg, are you all right?

22:08.200 --> 22:11.067
- I was just thinking that
when Bess was Evie's age,

22:12.133 --> 22:13.667
she'd lost all of her baby teeth

22:13.667 --> 22:16.100
but her big teeth were taking
a very long time to come down

22:16.100 --> 22:20.433
and she had these big gaps
and a big, gappy smile.

22:20.433 --> 22:21.600
It was adorable.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.133
And, well, it strikes me

22:25.133 --> 22:27.833
that you missed out on
seeing her like that.

22:30.867 --> 22:32.267
Happy Mother's Day, Julie.

22:34.533 --> 22:35.900
Happy Mother's Day, Marg.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.400
(phone rings)

22:40.400 --> 22:41.233
- Just excuse me.

22:43.067 --> 22:44.067
Hey, how's it going?

22:45.200 --> 22:46.067
- I think you're gonna
have to pick us up

22:46.067 --> 22:46.933
from the finish line.

22:46.933 --> 22:47.800
- Okay!

22:47.800 --> 22:48.867
Is everything all right?

22:48.867 --> 22:50.667
- I've hurt my leg and, uh,

22:50.667 --> 22:52.267
you know that time I wanted
to spend with the kids?

22:52.267 --> 22:53.433
I don't want that anymore.

22:53.433 --> 22:54.700
How's your day going?

22:54.700 --> 22:57.267
- Well, I have lied my
way through a luncheon,

22:57.267 --> 22:58.767
abused a sponsor child

22:58.767 --> 23:01.433
and Julie and Margaret
are pretending to be gay.

23:01.433 --> 23:04.200
(Margaret laughing)

23:04.200 --> 23:06.367
- [Danny] Okay, well, I'll
see you at the other end.

23:06.367 --> 23:07.300
- Okay.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.233
Bye.

23:08.233 --> 23:10.100
- Julie, you're actually funny!

23:10.100 --> 23:13.400
(Danny exclaims)

23:13.400 --> 23:15.300
- Are you sure you want to
swap bikes with them, Dad?

23:15.300 --> 23:16.300
- [Danny] Uh-huh.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.300
- I don't understand, Dad.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.833
You'll have to pedal
with one leg now.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.133
But if you stayed on the tandem,

23:21.133 --> 23:23.200
you could sit back and relax.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.367
I only got up to book
three of Lord Of The Rings!

23:26.367 --> 23:27.967
Dad!

23:27.967 --> 23:30.467
* Shabooey, shabooey

23:30.467 --> 23:32.900
* Shabooey, shabooey

23:32.900 --> 23:37.733
* Shabooey, shabooey

23:37.733 --> 23:38.933
* Shabooey, shabooey

23:38.933 --> 23:40.067
- You can put your order
in over with Brianna

23:40.067 --> 23:41.433
at the truck, mate.

23:41.433 --> 23:42.967
- I'm an officer with
the Health Department.

23:42.967 --> 23:45.433
- I'm sorry, mate, I can't
give preferential treatment.

23:45.433 --> 23:46.867
You'll have to go to the truck.

23:46.867 --> 23:48.400
- Can I check your thermometers?

23:48.400 --> 23:49.400
- What thermometers?

23:49.400 --> 23:50.600
- In your esky.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.367
Your meat should be
kept below five degrees.

23:52.367 --> 23:53.733
- What therm-

23:53.733 --> 23:56.167
- I don't think refrigeration
is an exact science.

23:56.167 --> 23:58.333
- That's precisely what it is.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.733
- Mate, barbecuing
comes from the heart.

24:00.733 --> 24:03.867
- And salmonella comes from
meat stored above five degrees.

24:03.867 --> 24:04.967
Are they burgers?

24:06.133 --> 24:07.800
Do you have a class-3 permit?

24:07.800 --> 24:09.067
- Beg yours?

24:09.067 --> 24:09.967
- Sausages are a
class-4 activity.

24:09.967 --> 24:11.667
Hamburgers are a class 3.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.300
And I'll need your
permit number.

24:13.300 --> 24:14.400
- Okay.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.233
What is it, Kayne?

24:15.233 --> 24:16.067
457?

24:16.067 --> 24:16.967
- 882339851, 12-

24:19.800 --> 24:21.500
- I'm gonna have
to shut this down.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.800
- Are you serious?

24:22.800 --> 24:24.067
- Come on, mate!

24:24.067 --> 24:25.567
Sausages, hamburgers,
what's the difference?

24:25.567 --> 24:26.900
- One's round, one's
long, that's it!

24:26.900 --> 24:28.367
- I tell you what.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.967
Why don't you try a
nice little slider?

24:30.967 --> 24:31.967
- Shut it down.

24:31.967 --> 24:32.800
- No!

24:34.200 --> 24:36.667
This is exactly the kind
of petty, minor bureaucracy

24:36.667 --> 24:38.500
I deal with every day.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.600
Never mind that we've created

24:39.600 --> 24:41.367
a wonderful
community atmosphere,

24:41.367 --> 24:43.733
we've raised $3,000 more
than we normally would,

24:43.733 --> 24:46.233
so Judy can have one extra
day in the office per week.

24:46.233 --> 24:47.700
No, let's worry
about whether or not

24:47.700 --> 24:51.167
it's a sausage or a hamburger
or a class 3 or a class 4

24:51.167 --> 24:55.167
or a pain in my dick
or a pain in my balls!

24:56.833 --> 24:58.267
Oh. they just...

24:58.267 --> 25:00.367
- He really is
perfect for Amber.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.400
- Who's moved all my
floor stock out here?

25:03.700 --> 25:06.767
Why is the 5-piece of
my wicker papasan there?

25:06.767 --> 25:07.733
Is that my barbecue?

25:07.733 --> 25:08.633
- No worries, Mickey.

25:08.633 --> 25:09.933
I can explain.

25:09.933 --> 25:11.067
We probably should
shut it down now.

25:11.067 --> 25:12.300
- Amber, that's Mickey!

25:12.300 --> 25:13.400
From Outdoor Living!

25:15.200 --> 25:17.400
- So lovely to meet
you, Miss Evie.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.600
- You too, Miss Margaret.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.467
(women laughing)

25:20.467 --> 25:21.733
- See ya, Ange.

25:22.967 --> 25:25.067
Great to meet you, Sharon.

25:25.067 --> 25:25.867
I'll call you.

25:25.867 --> 25:26.700
Bye!

25:28.233 --> 25:29.167
- Well?

25:29.167 --> 25:30.633
- Oh, how'd it go with Clara?

25:30.633 --> 25:34.300
- Before or after I told her
you weren't my lesbian mothers?

25:34.300 --> 25:35.300
- You told her?

25:35.300 --> 25:36.233
- Why?

25:36.233 --> 25:37.533
Because I was making you lie.

25:37.533 --> 25:39.400
And if she wants me on
the board of the IWM,

25:39.400 --> 25:40.733
it should be
because of who I am,

25:40.733 --> 25:42.067
not because of what
my parents are.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.067
- Don't be ridiculous!

25:43.067 --> 25:44.867
- That is so naive, Bessie.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.633
- Wait.

25:53.633 --> 25:54.500
What?

25:54.500 --> 25:55.600
- [Margaret] Clara!

25:55.600 --> 25:58.200
(upbeat music)

26:04.567 --> 26:05.733
- [Danny] Yes!

26:09.300 --> 26:10.933
- Dad, your time was...

26:10.933 --> 26:12.067
- Shut up!
- Four...

26:13.267 --> 26:14.233
- Where's your mum?

26:15.633 --> 26:16.667
- She couldn't change her mind?

26:16.667 --> 26:18.167
- Nuh.

26:18.167 --> 26:21.300
She couldn't believe that Marg
and I were together, but...

26:23.067 --> 26:23.900
we could be, couldn't we?

26:25.433 --> 26:27.333
- See, normally I don't mind
picturing a bit of that action

26:27.333 --> 26:30.400
but I feel a bit
funny with that image.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.367
Sorry about the spit, love.

26:31.367 --> 26:33.200
We just ran outta time.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.467
- No, no, it's fine.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.867
Besides, you've got all
this meat left over.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.267
Hey, hey!

26:38.267 --> 26:40.700
Evan, is he as nice as he seems?

26:40.700 --> 26:43.300
- I know it's early days,
but I think we're in love.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.067
- Wayne!

26:47.067 --> 26:48.067
I don't know how to thank you!

26:48.067 --> 26:50.867
We made $4,300.

26:50.867 --> 26:53.667
Actually, it'll be %3,700,

26:53.667 --> 26:56.300
plus $600 in goods
for the school.

26:56.300 --> 26:57.833
- Yeah, we couldn't
get it all cleaned up

26:57.833 --> 27:00.167
after the Korean barbecue,
so Mickey made us take it.

27:00.167 --> 27:01.333
- Got a good price
for it, though!

27:01.333 --> 27:02.767
- Yeah, it was
covered in soy sauce.

27:02.767 --> 27:05.067
(laughing)

27:05.933 --> 27:06.900
Good day.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.200
It was a good day.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.167
Good day.

27:09.167 --> 27:10.067
Yeah.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.433
- Dad! No.

27:12.433 --> 27:13.567
Just...

27:13.567 --> 27:14.667
(upbeat music)

27:14.667 --> 27:16.867
* Shabooey, shabooey

27:16.867 --> 27:19.333
* Shabooey, shabooey

27:19.333 --> 27:24.067
* Shabooey, shabooey

27:24.067 --> 27:26.500
* Shabooey, shabooey

27:26.500 --> 27:28.933
* Shabooey, shabooey

27:28.933 --> 27:33.833
* Shabooey, shabooey

27:33.833 --> 27:35.533
* I'm feeling for you

27:35.533 --> 27:38.167
* Baby heart attack

27:38.167 --> 27:41.100
* 'Cause your cool is electric

27:41.100 --> 27:43.067
* Blue and black

27:43.067 --> 27:45.533
* You're the master of modesty

27:45.533 --> 27:48.267
* My vivid dream
