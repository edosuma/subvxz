04:10.984 --> 04:14.258
- And how did it happen?
- Beat me up.

04:14.362 --> 04:18.908
They made me stand against the wall,
like this with me arms outstretched...

04:19.034 --> 04:21.036
and my legs stretched out behind me.

04:22.954 --> 04:26.708
Kept me like this for ages,
for over 30 hours or somethin' like that.

04:27.292 --> 04:30.483
And if I tried to relax
or lower me arms, they hit me.

04:30.587 --> 04:32.964
And then they gave me
the crab treatment.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.321
Were you arrested on Section 12?

04:35.425 --> 04:37.719
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.888
Do you have any idea why?

04:40.555 --> 04:44.935
Sort of like most of me mates
were accused of belongin' to the IRA.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.104
Which he wasn't.
That's why they let him go.

04:48.229 --> 04:51.316
Could you demonstrate
this crab treatment to us?

04:51.524 --> 04:52.609
Yeah.

05:07.415 --> 05:09.542
One of them grabbed me...

05:10.543 --> 05:12.879
you know, with me arms back here...

05:13.463 --> 05:16.028
while his mate punched me
in the stomach.

05:16.132 --> 05:17.696
He just punched me and punched me.

05:17.801 --> 05:20.637
And the other one
kept askin' me questions...

05:20.971 --> 05:23.932
askin' more questions,
and they punched me again.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.225
Okay?

05:25.809 --> 05:28.311
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.773
Jim, why don't you tell them
what happened to you?

05:32.315 --> 05:36.111
I was arrested the week before Michael
and taken to Castlereagh.

05:36.486 --> 05:39.406
And then they threw me
into a cell for about four hours.

05:39.656 --> 05:40.803
They took me out...

05:40.907 --> 05:43.389
brought me up to what
they call an interview room.

05:43.493 --> 05:46.183
And two cops were sittin' there with me.

05:46.288 --> 05:49.228
One of the cops asked me my name.
I never told him my name...

05:49.332 --> 05:52.752
'cause if they didn't know my name,
they wouldn't have arrested me.

05:53.295 --> 05:58.300
At once, as soon as I told him,
all four cops came rushin' in the room...

05:58.550 --> 06:01.407
took me off the chair,
lifted me by the arms and legs...

06:01.511 --> 06:03.221
and held me over a table.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.765
And one of them put a towel
round my face.

06:06.224 --> 06:08.914
He was holding it
at the back of my neck here...

06:09.019 --> 06:12.793
and another one poured water
over my nose and mouth.

06:12.897 --> 06:15.254
It was goin' up my nose
and into my throat...

06:15.358 --> 06:17.027
I was gettin' the drowning feeling.

06:19.404 --> 06:20.447
Sullivan?

06:57.734 --> 06:59.444
Get the bastard!

07:22.968 --> 07:24.844
I don't believe it.

07:25.387 --> 07:28.098
- Tribal rites.
- It's frightening.

07:41.236 --> 07:44.844
Can I take you onto the question
of the treatment of prisoners...

07:44.948 --> 07:48.681
the question of interrogation techniques
referred to in the press release.

07:48.785 --> 07:53.144
It suggests that these allegations
of ill-treatment have reduced since 1978.

07:53.248 --> 07:55.604
Can I ask you to comment?
Do you have a view...

07:55.709 --> 07:59.692
as to whether these forms of
ill-treatment that you found are fair?

07:59.796 --> 08:01.548
What evidence do you have for them?

08:01.881 --> 08:05.990
Not to be too dramatic,
but these are all...

08:06.094 --> 08:10.536
statements of alleged maltreatment that
we have collected over our time here.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.643
And that one?

08:13.977 --> 08:16.083
"Punching, slapping,
kicking the plaintiff.

08:16.187 --> 08:17.168
"Causing, requiring,

08:17.272 --> 08:20.921
permitting the plaintiff to lie
on the floor of an interview room.

08:21.026 --> 08:23.174
"Causing, requiring,
permitting the plaintiff...

08:23.278 --> 08:25.843
"to remove his coat and shoes
in the interview room.

08:25.947 --> 08:28.554
"Punching the plaintiff
in the abdominal area.

08:28.658 --> 08:32.140
"Banging the plaintiff's head off
the wall of the interview room.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.727
"Standing on the plaintiff's
shoulders, stomach, ankles and chest.

08:35.832 --> 08:39.690
"Squeezing the plaintiff's neck.
Squeezing the plaintiff's testicles.

08:39.794 --> 08:41.942
"Causing, requiring,
permitting the plaintiff...

08:42.047 --> 08:45.675
- "...to be spreadled..."
- Spread-eagled.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.804
"Between three members
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary...

08:49.930 --> 08:54.663
"while one kicked him with his heel
in the area of the abdomen and raped..."

08:54.768 --> 08:56.916
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.876
These are unconfirmed
allegations, right?

08:58.980 --> 09:01.253
Allegations for which
there is no outside evidence.

09:01.358 --> 09:03.318
These are allegations
from a group of people.

09:04.903 --> 09:07.322
A great deal of this evidence
is corroborated.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.096
Is it a war situation or not?

09:10.200 --> 09:13.265
If it's a war situation,
to solve that war situation...

09:13.370 --> 09:17.832
you have to negotiate, and so to accept
that there are two sides...

09:18.458 --> 09:21.586
putting around a table to negotiate...

09:21.795 --> 09:24.422
and that, the British
government doesn't accept.

09:24.673 --> 09:27.113
Does your report deal with
the shoot-to-kill policy...

09:27.217 --> 09:29.323
operatin' here in the six counties?

09:29.427 --> 09:33.598
Allegations of a shoot-to-kill policy
carried out by the RUC...

09:33.890 --> 09:38.124
the UDR, and the British Army
does form part of our report, yes.

09:38.228 --> 09:42.565
- Do you have any figures?
- Yes, in...

09:43.483 --> 09:45.840
the period of 1969 to 1980...

09:45.944 --> 09:48.592
the evidence shows
that at least 130 people...

09:48.697 --> 09:53.368
were killed by the security forces,
and half of those deaths...

09:53.577 --> 09:56.767
were of civilians
that had no connection...

09:56.871 --> 09:58.873
with paramilitary activities at all.

09:59.040 --> 10:03.628
Given the fact that there is a state of
armed insurrection in Northern Ireland...

10:03.878 --> 10:06.485
do you not concede
the government has every right...

10:06.590 --> 10:09.238
to take whatever measures
it deems necessary to...

10:09.342 --> 10:11.052
stem this insurrection?

10:11.761 --> 10:16.349
Britain is recognized the world over
as a democratic state.

10:16.933 --> 10:21.771
We will present our report
based on the documented evidence.

10:22.480 --> 10:26.067
And hopefully,
the British government will respond.

10:26.276 --> 10:27.986
I'm sure they will.

10:28.987 --> 10:31.010
Thank you. That's all we have time for.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.617
We're flying out tomorrow. Thank you.

10:40.582 --> 10:41.562
Hi.

10:41.666 --> 10:44.648
- I'm Teresa Doyle. Republican News.
- Excuse me?

10:44.753 --> 10:46.338
Republican News.

10:47.130 --> 10:48.736
You know the shoot-to-kill?

10:48.840 --> 10:51.989
It happens all the time.
I could show you a photograph.

10:52.093 --> 10:54.617
- Of what?
- Of an execution.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.202
You have that with you?

10:56.306 --> 11:00.372
It's not the sort of thing you carry around
the streets of Belfast in your handbag.

11:00.477 --> 11:01.770
But I could get it to you.

11:02.604 --> 11:05.398
I'm sorry.
Our investigation's concluded.

11:05.649 --> 11:09.569
- So you're not interested?
- No, we're not here to be used.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.614
Maybe that's all you're here for.

11:27.712 --> 11:28.964
Paul?

11:41.893 --> 11:44.729
- Is that the tape from yesterday?
- Yeah.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.524
I'm glad we're leaving tomorrow.

11:48.650 --> 11:50.527
Belfast reminds me of Chile.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.759
There's no comparison.
How can you say that?

11:53.863 --> 11:55.282
That's the way it feels:

11:55.865 --> 11:58.493
Killings, torture, intrigue.

12:03.206 --> 12:07.294
A reality check: What happened
in Chile can't happen here.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.881
- Let's eat.
- Yeah.

12:15.844 --> 12:19.014
- You got any money?
- Yes, I do.

12:19.222 --> 12:20.515
Good.

13:20.450 --> 13:24.162
So good night. See you tomorrow.
Tough day.

13:27.916 --> 13:29.376
Good night.

13:36.299 --> 13:39.261
Can you believe
he turned around and waved?

13:42.847 --> 13:46.393
- Do you know him?
- I don't know. I thought I did.

13:48.979 --> 13:51.231
- No messages.
- Okay, thanks.

15:03.386 --> 15:04.471
Yes.

15:04.721 --> 15:06.056
Harris?

15:07.307 --> 15:11.436
- I listened to your tape.
- Have you come to a decision?

15:12.395 --> 15:13.396
I don't know.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.190
We must talk.

15:16.107 --> 15:17.859
They saw us together.

15:19.069 --> 15:22.489
- How do you know?
- After I left you, I was followed.

15:22.697 --> 15:24.616
That means you're under surveillance.

15:25.242 --> 15:28.891
I really don't think that this is something
that I should get involved in...

15:28.995 --> 15:30.643
but I'll tell you what I can do.

15:30.747 --> 15:33.479
I can turn the tape over
to whatever authorities you deem...

15:33.583 --> 15:35.168
No! That would be crazy.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.170
We must meet.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.683
- Where?
- Near Dungannon. Now.

15:41.925 --> 15:43.823
It's less than an hour's drive away.

15:43.927 --> 15:46.179
Look, I've got a plane to catch.

15:47.222 --> 15:48.682
This won't take long.

17:01.504 --> 17:03.131
Mr. Sullivan?

17:05.342 --> 17:07.990
- Where's Harris?
- He's down the road, waiting on you.

17:08.094 --> 17:09.867
I am here to take you to him.

17:09.971 --> 17:13.141
You can leave your car here.
We'll go in mine.

17:13.349 --> 17:15.580
- My car's okay here?
- It's quite safe there.

17:15.685 --> 17:17.979
By the way, my name's Frank Molloy.

17:25.362 --> 17:27.739
- Did you bring the tape?
- Yeah.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.409
1169.

17:32.744 --> 17:34.037
Sorry?

17:34.496 --> 17:38.625
800 years: That's how long
we've been fightin' for independence.

17:39.209 --> 17:40.543
Sword...

17:40.961 --> 17:43.255
famine, burnin'...

17:43.380 --> 17:47.175
hangin', shootin', transportation:
We've had it all.

17:50.262 --> 17:51.846
Who's Harris?

17:52.931 --> 17:55.475
It's better he tells you himself.

17:59.271 --> 18:01.356
There's a car behind us.

18:02.857 --> 18:04.234
Is it following us?

18:05.110 --> 18:06.695
We'll soon find out.

18:07.571 --> 18:10.949
There's something wrong here.

18:11.241 --> 18:13.159
Get down! Get down!

19:21.645 --> 19:23.980
- Ms. Ingrid Jessner?
- Yes.

19:24.356 --> 19:27.713
I'm afraid we've got some
rather serious news for you.

19:27.817 --> 19:30.070
- May we come in?
- What is it?

19:31.238 --> 19:33.323
It's about Mr. Sullivan.

19:33.657 --> 19:36.868
He's been involved in a
rather serious incident.

19:38.662 --> 19:41.018
They were killed
in a car crash early this morning...

19:41.122 --> 19:43.959
which involved a police
checkpoint outside Dungannon.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.607
The men, who were driving
a yellow Ford Cortina...

19:46.711 --> 19:48.442
were signaled by police to stop.

19:48.546 --> 19:52.780
Ignoring the warning, the car accelerated
and drove directly at the officers.

19:52.884 --> 19:56.617
Police opened fire on the vehicle
as it attempted to escape.

19:56.721 --> 19:59.912
The car then went out of control
and careered off the road.

20:00.016 --> 20:03.833
Upon arrival at the crash scene,
police found the occupants were dead.

20:03.937 --> 20:07.023
Names of the two men
have not yet been released.

20:29.838 --> 20:33.216
Can you identify the body
as that of Paul Sullivan?

20:55.405 --> 20:56.531
Yes.

21:18.887 --> 21:20.221
Ingrid.

21:23.099 --> 21:24.726
Come on. Let's go.

21:56.049 --> 21:58.406
Ms. Jessner,
where have you just come from?

21:58.510 --> 22:00.282
Can you move away?

22:00.387 --> 22:03.661
It's said the man in the car
with Mr. Sullivan was a terrorist suspect.

22:03.765 --> 22:04.703
Is that true?

22:04.808 --> 22:07.581
- What are you suggesting?
- Who was with Mr. Sullivan?

22:07.686 --> 22:10.334
- I have no idea.
- Police say he was a terrorist suspect.

22:10.438 --> 22:12.336
Did the car go through
a police roadcheck?

22:12.440 --> 22:16.048
They say they opened fire
after the car went through a checkpoint?

22:16.152 --> 22:18.384
Where were they going this morning?
Did you know?

22:18.488 --> 22:23.159
As journalists, you must appreciate
that I can't talk about this right now.

22:28.790 --> 22:31.230
The driver of the car
in which the shooting occurred...

22:31.334 --> 22:34.817
has been named as Frank Molloy.
Police said the car failed to stop...

22:34.921 --> 22:38.863
at a roadblock outside Dungannon
around 6:15 this morning.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.574
An RUC statement said
the driver accelerated...

22:41.678 --> 22:44.744
toward their officers,
who opened fire on the fleeing car...

22:44.848 --> 22:46.662
causing it to swerve off the road.

22:46.766 --> 22:51.125
Also in the car was Paul Sullivan,
an American lawyer and a leading figure...

22:51.229 --> 22:53.669
in the International League
for Civil Liberties.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.171
What's puzzling observers...

22:55.275 --> 22:58.007
is why Mr. Sullivan should have
driven out of Belfast...

22:58.111 --> 23:01.260
in the early hours of the morning
to meet a man...

23:01.364 --> 23:04.013
who the police say
is a terrorist suspect.

23:04.117 --> 23:07.329
This is Ivan Little,
Ulster Television, Dungannon.

23:08.830 --> 23:10.436
With me in the studio to discuss...

23:10.540 --> 23:13.105
the political implications
of today's shooting...

23:13.209 --> 23:14.669
is Mr. Alec Nevin...

23:15.128 --> 23:18.527
who is a Conservative Party spokesman
on Northern Ireland.

23:18.632 --> 23:21.238
Mr. Nevin, earlier, we saw
pictures of Americans...

23:21.343 --> 23:24.241
demonstrating outside
the British embassy in Washington.

23:24.346 --> 23:27.912
Let's make a distinction.
What we saw was a demonstration...

23:28.016 --> 23:29.872
by supporters of the IRA...

23:29.976 --> 23:31.123
Could I finish my question?

23:31.227 --> 23:33.292
The people who give comfort
and weapons...

23:33.396 --> 23:34.752
to the men of violence.

23:34.856 --> 23:37.171
John Ware, Labour MP.

23:37.275 --> 23:39.757
A particularly embarrassing thing,
I would think...

23:39.861 --> 23:44.741
was, of course, the death of
this civil-liberties spokesman...

23:45.033 --> 23:47.807
It's quite clear that people
will be asking the question:

23:47.911 --> 23:50.893
Does this mean the investigation
has hit on a raw nerve...

23:50.997 --> 23:54.063
has revealed some of the things
that have been perpetrated...

23:54.167 --> 23:57.254
by security forces due to
their presence in Northern Ireland?

24:00.215 --> 24:02.363
Is Ms. Jessner coming
down to talk to us today?

24:02.467 --> 24:04.824
- No. She's resting.
- How is she?

24:04.928 --> 24:05.908
All right.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.202
Have you been told any more
about what happened...

24:08.306 --> 24:10.892
on the morning of the shooting?

24:11.226 --> 24:15.126
The only thing that we know is that
Mr. Sullivan has been murdered...

24:15.230 --> 24:17.753
by a member of the security forces...

24:17.857 --> 24:21.048
near Dungannon in a car, a rented car...

24:21.152 --> 24:23.488
with a man called Mr. Molloy.

24:23.697 --> 24:26.220
Did Mr. Sullivan have
Republican sympathies?

24:26.324 --> 24:28.305
- No.
- Was he a member of Noraid?

24:28.410 --> 24:31.246
- Not at all.
- What kind of a man was he, Mr. Sullivan?

24:32.581 --> 24:37.523
The only thing I can say is he was
a very good lawyer and a great fighter...

24:37.627 --> 24:40.776
for the civil rights all over the world
and a marvelous friend.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.487
The British government have
just appointed...

24:43.592 --> 24:45.448
Deputy Chief Constable Kerrigan...

24:45.552 --> 24:47.950
to head up the investigation
on the shooting.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.368
What's your reaction to that?

24:49.472 --> 24:54.123
I've heard that Kerrigan is
a fine investigator of the CID...

24:54.227 --> 24:56.376
but we would have preferred that...

24:56.480 --> 25:00.880
it would have been an independent,
international inquiry.

25:00.984 --> 25:03.215
So you don't have
any confidence in the inquiry?

25:03.320 --> 25:05.947
I've got a certain amount
of skepticism about that.

25:06.489 --> 25:08.554
You said that you were skeptical. Why?

25:08.658 --> 25:11.182
Why will the Kerrigan inquiry
not discover the truth?

25:11.286 --> 25:16.061
Because you had a lot of inquiries
in the 13 past years...

25:16.166 --> 25:19.419
and it didn't change anything.

25:37.145 --> 25:40.252
Excuse me, sir. I'm Sgt. Hughes,
your liaison for your stay.

25:40.357 --> 25:42.755
Hello.
This is Chief Superintendent Maxwell.

25:42.859 --> 25:45.091
How do you do?
The car's just outside the front.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.530
- Can I take your bag?
- Thank you.

25:52.953 --> 25:55.392
- This Jessner woman...
- Sullivan's girlfriend.

25:55.497 --> 25:59.834
What time is it now?
4:00. Late in the day.

26:00.669 --> 26:02.837
What about this Mrs. Molloy?

26:03.546 --> 26:06.591
She lives in Fort William.

26:07.634 --> 26:09.865
How far is it to Fort William, Sergeant?

26:09.970 --> 26:13.640
Fort William's just over here
on the right, sir, about a mile away.

26:15.558 --> 26:18.290
It might be a good idea
if you spoke to them both together.

26:18.395 --> 26:19.980
Let them feed off each other.

26:44.963 --> 26:46.464
Your ID, Sarge?

27:03.315 --> 27:05.129
Might as well leave
the cases in the car.

27:05.233 --> 27:08.507
- We'll be going to the hotel after.
- Sure they'll be safe here?

27:08.612 --> 27:10.113
I hope so, sir.

27:22.334 --> 27:23.877
Just in here, sir.

27:30.759 --> 27:33.803
- We're a bit pushed for space, sir.
- Not bad.

27:34.512 --> 27:38.079
I want a large wall map of Northern Ireland
and a blackboard.

27:38.183 --> 27:41.019
- Blackboard?
- Those big black things you write on.

27:41.478 --> 27:42.896
Yes, sir.

27:43.104 --> 27:48.151
- I'll tell Mr. Brodie you're here, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant. That's kind of you.

27:54.824 --> 27:57.786
Hello.

27:59.120 --> 28:03.312
- I've seen Jack Cunningham lately.
- What's he doing nowadays?

28:03.416 --> 28:06.774
- He runs his own security business.
- He must be rolling in it.

28:06.878 --> 28:08.546
He's earned it.

28:09.506 --> 28:11.779
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kerrigan.

28:11.883 --> 28:13.531
Chief Superintendent Maxwell.

28:13.635 --> 28:14.740
Sir.

28:14.844 --> 28:16.784
- Good flight?
- Bit cramped.

28:16.888 --> 28:18.640
Yeah, always is.

28:19.140 --> 28:21.122
This is not what you're used to,
I suppose.

28:21.226 --> 28:24.083
It's the best we can do
for one of Britain's top policemen.

28:24.187 --> 28:25.563
It's perfectly adequate.

28:26.898 --> 28:29.505
- Anything else you need?
- Thank you. I'll ask.

28:29.609 --> 28:32.091
Detective Sgt. Hughes
will be your liaison officer.

28:32.195 --> 28:34.760
He will organize
all your internal appointments.

28:34.864 --> 28:39.077
- Yes, secretarial staff...
- She'll be arriving tomorrow.

28:39.244 --> 28:40.745
Excuse me.

28:42.956 --> 28:46.167
- Have you read the CID interim report?
- Yes.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.442
Now, as I understand it...

28:49.546 --> 28:54.155
your terms of reference in the inquiry
are to reexamine the evidence and...

28:54.259 --> 28:56.741
Or if necessary,
reinvestigate the circumstances...

28:56.845 --> 28:59.848
which led to the shooting
of Paul Sullivan and Frank Molloy.

29:00.348 --> 29:03.518
I'm sure that your expertise
will be appreciated.

29:04.227 --> 29:07.480
However, I should warn you
that you may encounter some prejudice.

29:08.064 --> 29:11.547
- From members of your force?
- Possibly. But don't let that deter you.

29:11.651 --> 29:13.111
It won't.

29:14.029 --> 29:17.970
See, you have to bear in mind
the situation here in Northern Ireland.

29:18.074 --> 29:20.702
We operate under enormous pressure.

29:21.328 --> 29:24.143
For the last 12 years,
the Royal Ulster Constabulary...

29:24.247 --> 29:28.084
have fought to maintain the peace
against the terrorists.

29:28.710 --> 29:31.254
140 people have given their lives.

29:31.671 --> 29:33.173
3,500 have been injured.

29:33.632 --> 29:36.927
And 155 medals for outstanding
feats of gallantry.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.658
Naturally, when outsiders
from the mainland...

29:39.763 --> 29:43.391
- come here to the province to tell us...
- I do understand.

29:45.352 --> 29:48.959
But rest assured, no obstacle
will be placed in your path.

29:49.064 --> 29:52.400
- You'll receive my full cooperation.
- Thank you.

29:52.692 --> 29:56.217
About accommodation, we have a couple
of safe houses where RUC personnel...

29:56.321 --> 30:01.159
I think it would be better if we
were to stay in a small hotel somewhere.

30:01.660 --> 30:02.681
Can I ask why?

30:02.786 --> 30:05.851
I don't want to socialize with officers
I might have to question.

30:05.956 --> 30:08.500
Best keep it on a strictly
professional basis.

30:08.959 --> 30:12.087
- Could I just say one thing, so...
- Also, I'll need a car...

30:12.879 --> 30:14.631
without a driver.

30:15.382 --> 30:17.696
You realize that I can't
guarantee your safety?

30:17.801 --> 30:18.781
Absolutely.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.888
Just let me say one thing,
so there can be no misunderstanding.

30:22.055 --> 30:27.018
When you have completed your inquiry,
you will deliver your report to me first.

30:28.395 --> 30:31.710
- I understood it was to go to the DPP first.
- No, it comes to me first.

30:31.815 --> 30:34.422
I will forward it
to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

30:34.526 --> 30:37.195
That is the constitutional position.

30:37.487 --> 30:41.095
We might as well keep that
on a professional basis, too.

30:41.199 --> 30:43.618
- Okay.
- Thank you.

30:54.170 --> 30:55.672
Ingrid...

30:56.381 --> 31:00.260
Henri and I will stay with you
for as long as you need us.

31:00.677 --> 31:02.512
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

31:03.513 --> 31:07.142
I think you can do more
back home than you can do here.

31:15.358 --> 31:16.651
Hello?

31:17.694 --> 31:20.739
No, it isn't Ingrid. Who is calling?

31:23.325 --> 31:25.285
Can you wait a second?

31:26.119 --> 31:27.996
It's Paul's mother.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.461
All right?

31:38.214 --> 31:39.466
Rose?

31:46.681 --> 31:48.496
How are you? Are you all right?

31:48.600 --> 31:50.956
Is there somebody there?
Is somebody with you?

31:51.061 --> 31:53.021
That's good.

31:54.147 --> 31:58.193
I'm all right.
I have some friends here, and it's...

32:37.899 --> 32:41.278
What's the crack on this
Insp. Stephens of CID?

32:41.528 --> 32:44.739
Stephens? Decent enough man.

32:45.532 --> 32:47.304
Is he handling the shooting?

32:47.409 --> 32:50.850
Yes. If he was one of my detectives,
he'd be back in uniform.

32:50.954 --> 32:51.934
Why?

32:52.038 --> 32:55.542
Three hours after the shooting,
the RUC issued a statement.

32:55.792 --> 32:57.377
It was fabricated.

32:57.961 --> 33:00.735
- Maybe they had a reason?
- No resistance was offered.

33:00.839 --> 33:04.301
The weapon found in the car
clearly didn't belong there.

33:04.467 --> 33:07.032
Forensic showed that
the shot that killed the Yank...

33:07.137 --> 33:11.266
was fired at two meters.
The trajectory was wrong.

33:12.309 --> 33:16.104
The officer that did the shooting
claims he shot at 25 feet.

33:16.479 --> 33:19.274
None of this was in the interim report.

33:19.816 --> 33:23.883
What if there were witnesses,
and it comes out at the inquest?

33:23.987 --> 33:26.385
You know as well as I
how long these things take.

33:26.489 --> 33:29.305
I know of two cases:
One seven years ago, the other was five.

33:29.409 --> 33:32.600
- There's still no inquest in either of them.
- This one's different.

33:32.704 --> 33:35.790
There's a lot of dead bodies
in Northern Ireland, Peter.

33:36.166 --> 33:40.545
Jack, you haven't been followin' the news.
Why the hell do you think I'm here?

33:40.754 --> 33:44.653
- A prominent American was involved.
- Brodie was hoping you'd do a snow job.

33:44.758 --> 33:46.238
Not a chance.

33:46.343 --> 33:48.282
Next to the Pope,
you're about to become...

33:48.386 --> 33:51.202
the most unpopular man
in Northern Ireland.

33:51.306 --> 33:54.768
What you have to understand is
Special Branch control the whole thing.

33:55.435 --> 33:56.937
Why do you think I got out?

33:57.562 --> 34:01.399
As soon as my time was up,
I just grabbed my pension and ran.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.695
These three policemen involved
in the shooting...

34:06.112 --> 34:09.114
- Cowboys, not policemen.
- Tell me about them.

34:09.866 --> 34:13.474
Members of an antiterrorist squad,
operating undercover.

34:13.578 --> 34:15.789
SSU, Special Support Unit...

34:16.248 --> 34:18.145
code-named Echo 4 Alpha.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.710
- Answerable to whom?
- Don't ask.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.629
I have to know.

34:23.045 --> 34:25.569
I'm not saying
we shouldn't use them against the IRA...

34:25.674 --> 34:30.512
but the fact is, they're out of control.
They're off the wire, trigger-happy.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.536
They go where they want,
do what they want.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.351
They shoot first, no questions asked.

34:37.226 --> 34:40.438
The other side don't play
by the rules either.

34:40.563 --> 34:42.023
We're not the IRA.

34:42.899 --> 34:45.339
Goin' back to these three policemen...

34:45.443 --> 34:47.882
If they were involved,
then it's a covert operation.

34:47.987 --> 34:50.719
- What about Special Branch?
- They are Special Branch.

34:50.824 --> 34:54.411
- Sanctioned by them?
- Or Ml5 or Ml6.

34:55.203 --> 34:57.455
Take your pick.
We all piss in the same pot.

35:01.251 --> 35:03.691
If the British public knew
half of what goes on...

35:03.795 --> 35:06.861
in Northern Ireland,
they wouldn't sleep in their beds.

35:06.965 --> 35:11.428
- I don't know what the answer is.
- Good night, Jack. Thanks.

35:11.678 --> 35:13.284
Do yourself a favor, Peter.

35:13.388 --> 35:15.828
I know it goes against the grain,
but toe the line.

35:15.932 --> 35:18.289
Give them what they want,
and get back to England.

35:18.393 --> 35:21.041
- We'll see.
- You're a pillock!

35:21.146 --> 35:22.397
Mind how you go.

35:22.606 --> 35:26.067
Nobody gives a shit
what happens in Northern Ireland.

36:37.472 --> 36:40.892
- What's wrong?
- I found this on the seat of my car.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.750
"The next bullet is for you
if you don't get out of Ireland.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.606
"Our day will come".

36:47.607 --> 36:48.942
IRA?

36:52.988 --> 36:54.927
It's a 9-millimeter.

36:55.031 --> 36:56.866
Walther PPK pistol.

36:58.702 --> 37:02.080
That's a weapon favored by the cowboys
we talked about earlier.

37:03.248 --> 37:05.292
- Echo 4 Alpha?
- Yeah.

37:07.377 --> 37:08.837
So where are you taking me?

37:10.338 --> 37:12.173
It's one of ours, Peter.

37:13.508 --> 37:15.176
Excuse me. Hi.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.638
Good afternoon, Ms. Jessner.

37:19.055 --> 37:20.703
- Any further news yet?
- No, none.

37:20.807 --> 37:22.830
- What are your plans now?
- I have none...

37:22.934 --> 37:26.021
and I don't want to say anything.
Please, now, thank you.

37:26.313 --> 37:27.501
- Ms. Jessner.
- Mr. Kerrigan.

37:27.606 --> 37:29.253
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Of course.

37:29.357 --> 37:31.338
Did you get in touch with Mrs. Molloy?

37:31.443 --> 37:33.904
Yes. She's expecting us.

37:34.696 --> 37:36.990
How are your skills as a navigator?

37:56.760 --> 37:58.386
This is Paradox.

37:59.429 --> 38:01.389
Subjects leaving location.

38:02.015 --> 38:03.767
Tabs on now, please.

38:11.191 --> 38:13.652
Paul was murdered, Mr. Kerrigan.

38:14.277 --> 38:17.948
- Why would the police want to kill him?
- I don't know, but they did.

38:18.615 --> 38:21.159
- What proof do you have?
- None.

38:22.786 --> 38:25.288
But I do know what goes on here.

38:25.664 --> 38:29.668
Torture, paid informants,
roadside executions, death squads.

38:36.383 --> 38:40.032
Mr. Kerrigan, when I was
going through Paul's things...

38:40.136 --> 38:43.056
I found something
I think might be important.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.350
It's an empty cassette box.

38:46.101 --> 38:49.312
Paul was meticulous,
and I can't find that tape.

38:50.021 --> 38:52.211
- Did you ask about it?
- I told the police.

38:52.315 --> 38:56.403
- And what did they say?
- They would look into it and call me back.

38:56.611 --> 38:58.572
- And did they?
- No.

38:59.823 --> 39:01.637
What was on the tape?

39:01.741 --> 39:05.412
I don't know, but he was listening
to it the night before.

39:11.918 --> 39:13.420
This is it.

39:17.716 --> 39:21.866
I also found this list of names.

39:21.970 --> 39:24.139
- Is this his writing?
- Yes.

39:30.979 --> 39:33.523
This is a pretty formidable group.

39:34.524 --> 39:37.611
Lord Randall, Alec Nevin,
Sir Gerald Binning...

39:40.280 --> 39:41.719
Why did he write these six names?

39:41.823 --> 39:44.054
- I don't know.
- Had he met them?

39:44.159 --> 39:46.161
No, not that I know of.

39:47.954 --> 39:49.852
Have you shown this to anyone else?

39:49.956 --> 39:53.084
No. Why, what do you think it is?

39:53.376 --> 39:55.295
What do you think?

39:56.379 --> 39:59.007
Could be people targeted, hit list.

40:01.259 --> 40:05.367
- I'm not saying it is, but...
- Paul was not involved with terrorists.

40:05.472 --> 40:07.349
Perhaps innocently.

40:07.557 --> 40:10.873
- Maybe he was being used.
- He was too smart to be manipulated.

40:10.977 --> 40:12.958
He was a good lawyer.
He thought like one.

40:13.063 --> 40:15.002
Then why did he write down
these six names?

40:15.106 --> 40:18.693
And why did he leave the hotel
at 5:00 in the morning, leaving you?

40:19.319 --> 40:21.509
What was he doing
driving around Dungannon...

40:21.613 --> 40:24.032
with a fringe member of the IRA?

40:25.325 --> 40:27.702
He must have been mixed up in something.

40:28.495 --> 40:31.102
Mrs. Molloy, is this Frank's father?

40:31.206 --> 40:33.729
- That's his father.
- Who's that?

40:33.833 --> 40:38.755
Them's his friends, lifelong friends.
They just can't believe it either.

40:40.340 --> 40:45.220
Those were taken on holiday.
It was the last holiday we had.

40:47.681 --> 40:50.225
Have you a religion, Mr. Kerrigan?

40:51.309 --> 40:52.706
Catholic.

40:52.811 --> 40:56.481
In the heel of the hunt,
we'll all be answerable to God.

40:56.773 --> 40:59.630
I curse the bloody day
we ever came back here.

40:59.734 --> 41:01.236
Why did you?

41:01.570 --> 41:05.699
No choice. He was workin'
for the Ministry of Defense in London.

41:06.032 --> 41:08.556
Some bright spark
sent him on this course.

41:08.660 --> 41:10.850
Then he was transferred over here.

41:10.954 --> 41:13.206
What kind of work did he do?

41:13.623 --> 41:15.458
It came under the army...

41:15.709 --> 41:18.837
to do with education
and publishing things.

41:19.796 --> 41:23.425
To tell you the truth,
he never talked much about it...

41:23.592 --> 41:25.448
but he wasn't happy.

41:25.552 --> 41:27.429
That's why he left?

41:28.138 --> 41:31.766
Under a cloud.
Said he couldn't stomach it anymore.

41:32.726 --> 41:34.936
Can I take a look at these?

41:37.147 --> 41:40.150
- Who's that?
- That's Grace's weddin'.

41:40.942 --> 41:44.049
- It's your daughter?
- That was a beautiful day.

41:44.154 --> 41:46.072
She looks wonderful.

41:46.781 --> 41:48.033
Mrs. Molloy...

41:50.327 --> 41:52.767
Did your husband ever mention
Paul to you?

41:52.871 --> 41:54.080
No.

41:55.248 --> 41:58.022
They must have known each other, though,
don't you think?

41:58.126 --> 42:01.254
They must've.
But I never heard Frank mention him.

42:01.546 --> 42:03.924
You were telling us earlier...

42:04.215 --> 42:06.635
that the house was searched.

42:06.927 --> 42:08.845
Yes. Two days after.

42:10.180 --> 42:12.641
Do you know who authorized it?
Was it the police?

42:12.807 --> 42:15.060
The big knock authorized it.

42:15.393 --> 42:19.606
1:00 in the mornin', you either
open up, or your door goes in.

42:20.231 --> 42:22.234
Did they question you?

42:22.442 --> 42:24.903
Asked me if I knew Capt. Harris.

42:25.570 --> 42:26.571
Capt. Harris?

42:26.988 --> 42:30.659
Frank's old boss.
Worked in a unit at Lisburn.

42:31.034 --> 42:34.100
- And what did you tell them?
- Told them the truth.

42:34.204 --> 42:36.831
The last time I saw Capt. Harris...

42:37.332 --> 42:38.625
was at the weddin'.

42:38.875 --> 42:41.378
Did they find anything?

42:42.003 --> 42:45.319
They took away some papers
and all his cassette tapes.

42:45.423 --> 42:47.425
- Tapes?
- The lot.

42:48.176 --> 42:51.117
Capt. Harris,
if he was at the wedding...

42:51.221 --> 42:53.786
he might be in one of these photographs.

42:53.890 --> 42:55.830
You've just been looking at it.

42:55.934 --> 42:59.938
- This one?
- That's him, next to the groom.

43:02.399 --> 43:03.775
I know him.

43:04.025 --> 43:06.820
- You met him?
- No, I know his face.

43:08.363 --> 43:11.032
He was talking to Paul
at the Orange Parade.

43:12.117 --> 43:16.037
- Here are the documents you asked for.
- Thank you, Chief.

43:28.383 --> 43:31.094
Could you initial there, Mr. Maxwell?

43:38.602 --> 43:43.148
And you'll have to sign
the secured-documents book as well.

43:48.778 --> 43:52.032
And how did you get involved
in civil liberties?

43:53.158 --> 43:54.701
I was in Chile.

43:54.993 --> 43:57.016
I was doing some research...

43:57.120 --> 43:59.789
for a TV documentary
called The Disappeared.

44:00.332 --> 44:03.606
It was about the victims of Pinochet
after the coup.

44:03.710 --> 44:07.881
- Paul was there working for the League.
- When was that?

44:08.465 --> 44:09.925
1975.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.929
There was a technical adviser
working with us...

44:14.471 --> 44:16.932
a young Chilean journalist.

44:17.432 --> 44:20.873
He disappeared one day
and I went to the League and Paul...

44:20.977 --> 44:24.272
to see if they could find out
what happened to him.

44:26.650 --> 44:28.944
- And did they?
- No.

44:31.488 --> 44:34.282
It was a year before we found out
he'd been executed.

44:34.991 --> 44:36.952
What happened to the film?

44:37.160 --> 44:40.267
- Never got made.
- Too controversial?

44:40.372 --> 44:41.665
Too honest, I think.

44:42.499 --> 44:45.523
It was about how Mr. Kissinger,
the CIA, and the Pentagon...

44:45.627 --> 44:48.338
had made Chile safe for democracy.

44:51.591 --> 44:54.010
So I quit TV and joined the League.

44:54.636 --> 44:56.721
Got to know Paul better.

44:59.432 --> 45:01.789
How about you? You have a wife?

45:01.893 --> 45:03.103
Yes.

45:03.603 --> 45:05.188
- Kids?
- Three.

45:05.939 --> 45:08.733
Two at university, one away at school.

45:08.900 --> 45:11.424
- See them much?
- Not as often as I'd like.

45:11.528 --> 45:14.844
May I have your attention, please?
Telephone call for Mr. Kerrigan.

45:14.948 --> 45:18.097
- Would a Mr. Kerrigan please...
- Excuse me.

45:18.201 --> 45:19.703
Thank you.

45:27.043 --> 45:28.211
Yes?

45:28.420 --> 45:31.694
It's Tom. I got that stuff on Harris,
what there is of it.

45:31.798 --> 45:32.945
Go ahead.

45:33.049 --> 45:37.429
The first name's James John.
Born Gateshead, 1942.

45:37.721 --> 45:42.017
Religion, Protestant. Joined the
army, 1960, as a private soldier.

45:42.225 --> 45:44.769
Promoted to the rank
of lieutenant in '64.

45:45.437 --> 45:48.273
Doesn't say which mob. 1971...

45:48.523 --> 45:49.670
he attended a course...

45:49.774 --> 45:54.279
at the United States Army
Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg.

45:54.529 --> 45:56.698
A year later, 1972...

45:57.073 --> 46:01.703
he was seconded to the
Psychological Warfare Unit...

46:01.912 --> 46:03.038
known as PSYOPS.

46:03.163 --> 46:05.436
- The same place Molloy went to.
- Right.

46:05.540 --> 46:09.502
In 1973, he was sent to Northern Ireland
as a senior captain.

46:10.170 --> 46:15.071
That's it, apart from a list of postings
at various regiments.

46:15.175 --> 46:17.260
- Nothing else?
- Dead end.

46:17.427 --> 46:18.720
And since '73?

46:19.429 --> 46:21.744
- Classified.
- They told you that?

46:21.848 --> 46:24.059
With great emphasis.
The shutters came down.

46:31.274 --> 46:34.256
If there is a connection
between Paul's death and Harris...

46:34.361 --> 46:36.071
There has to be.

46:36.363 --> 46:38.719
Then I need to know more
about the background.

46:38.823 --> 46:41.055
Why not start with where he is?

46:41.159 --> 46:43.682
According to the colonel
I spoke to in Lisburn...

46:43.787 --> 46:46.248
Harris is away on leave
and can't be traced.

46:48.291 --> 46:50.523
There was a hint
he may be suffering from stress.

46:50.627 --> 46:52.545
Do you believe that?

46:52.796 --> 46:53.964
No.

46:55.257 --> 46:56.508
Mr. Kerrigan...

46:57.300 --> 46:59.344
How far are you willing to go with this?

47:00.262 --> 47:01.304
If...

47:01.972 --> 47:03.994
and it's still a big if...

47:04.099 --> 47:07.852
but if Harris is, in any way,
connected with this shooting...

47:08.436 --> 47:11.001
I don't care whose toes I tread on.

47:11.106 --> 47:15.443
He becomes part of the investigation,
no more, no less.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.114
- Okay?
- Okay.

47:20.615 --> 47:23.952
What it boils down to, Sergeant,
is that you're in deep trouble.

47:24.327 --> 47:27.560
You're in a shit storm,
and it's blowing around your ears.

47:27.664 --> 47:29.937
We're not just talking about
disciplinary charges.

47:30.041 --> 47:31.897
It goes beyond that.

47:32.002 --> 47:34.629
You could be facing a murder charge.

47:34.963 --> 47:37.528
This man Sullivan was
no run-of-the-mill Paddy...

47:37.632 --> 47:39.572
you could just blow away.

47:39.676 --> 47:42.408
He was an American lawyer
with an international reputation.

47:42.512 --> 47:45.557
Now, there is no way
this will be brushed under the carpet.

47:47.183 --> 47:48.893
How old are you?

47:49.728 --> 47:50.895
37.

47:51.771 --> 47:55.066
- How long have you been on the force?
- Twelve years.

48:00.572 --> 48:03.888
Two years ago, you shot dead
a Republican in the Falls.

48:03.992 --> 48:07.266
- It was either him or me, sir.
- I'm not criticizing you, Sergeant.

48:07.370 --> 48:09.143
You should have been given
a commendation.

48:09.247 --> 48:11.791
- I was.
- I'm on your side.

48:14.044 --> 48:15.921
But if you go down for this...

48:16.713 --> 48:20.717
how long do you think you'd last
in the Crumlin Road Prison?

48:25.680 --> 48:27.828
- You searched the bodies?
- Yes, sir.

48:27.933 --> 48:30.477
- Took away all personal effects?
- Yes, sir.

48:30.602 --> 48:32.854
Find anything interesting on Sullivan?

48:33.188 --> 48:37.859
Usual stuff: Wallet, money, ID card.

48:38.902 --> 48:41.363
What about the tape he was carrying?

48:43.990 --> 48:46.034
There was no tape, sir.

48:47.661 --> 48:49.975
- Are you getting all this?
- Yes, sir.

48:50.080 --> 48:52.645
- Read out that last bit.
- From where?

48:52.749 --> 48:54.376
From me asking about the tape.

48:54.918 --> 48:59.673
"What about the tape he was carrying?"
"There was no tape, sir".

49:00.882 --> 49:02.926
Do you want me to leave it at that?

49:03.093 --> 49:06.575
It's up to you. You've already lied once
in your statement to the CID.

49:06.680 --> 49:11.142
- I'm bound by the Official Secrets Act.
- Not anymore, you're not.

49:12.269 --> 49:14.479
All constraints are lifted.

49:15.397 --> 49:18.587
You can wipe the slate clean
and tell me everything that happened...

49:18.692 --> 49:22.070
and you might get off with a reprimand,
or you bury yourself deeper.

49:22.821 --> 49:24.614
So what's it gonna be?

49:32.789 --> 49:34.583
After the shooting...

49:35.834 --> 49:39.045
we returned to the barracks
for the debriefing.

49:41.381 --> 49:43.091
We were told...

49:43.967 --> 49:46.720
by a senior officer what to say.

49:48.138 --> 49:49.347
Name?

49:51.141 --> 49:52.767
Superintendent Fraser.

49:53.768 --> 49:55.979
He instructed you to lie to the CID?

49:56.187 --> 49:57.543
Yes, sir.

49:57.647 --> 50:00.629
He said it was to protect
our source of information.

50:00.734 --> 50:02.715
Do you know what that source was?

50:02.819 --> 50:04.946
No, sir. We were only told to intercept.

50:05.989 --> 50:08.617
Were you ordered to shoot on sight?

50:09.826 --> 50:11.786
Not in so many words.

50:12.662 --> 50:13.955
What does that mean?

50:14.956 --> 50:18.981
We were told that the two men in the car
were armed and dangerous...

50:19.085 --> 50:22.130
and we mustn't take
any chances with them.

50:23.006 --> 50:25.258
How did you interpret that?

50:26.176 --> 50:29.075
I got the feeling that we were
being given clear signals...

50:29.179 --> 50:33.183
to bring them back dead or alive,
and there'd be no questions asked.

50:34.017 --> 50:36.311
Now, tell me about the tape.

50:38.146 --> 50:40.377
We took it from the American.

50:40.482 --> 50:41.775
Go on.

50:42.692 --> 50:44.903
When we got back to the barracks...

50:45.528 --> 50:47.510
Mr. Fraser was there to meet us.

50:47.614 --> 50:49.720
And there was someone else
along with him.

50:49.824 --> 50:53.036
- A police officer?
- More like Special Branch.

50:53.370 --> 50:55.935
- What was his name?
- I don't know.

50:56.039 --> 50:57.624
But he seemed to be in charge.

50:58.959 --> 51:00.877
Can you describe him?

51:01.378 --> 51:02.796
English...

51:03.713 --> 51:05.006
tall...

51:05.674 --> 51:07.384
thinning on top...

51:08.051 --> 51:09.636
age, about 40.

51:11.680 --> 51:13.431
So what happened?

51:15.141 --> 51:18.728
The first thing the tall man asked about
was the tape.

51:20.105 --> 51:22.524
- Which he took with him?
- Yes, sir.

51:23.066 --> 51:26.861
- Have you any idea what was on the tape?
- Not a clue, sir.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.533
Okay.

51:33.076 --> 51:36.621
We'll just run through it again.
Then you can sign it.

51:40.959 --> 51:43.128
Do you have his statement?

51:47.090 --> 51:48.550
Here. Now.

51:49.259 --> 51:52.867
The senior officer that did the debriefing,
Superintendent Fraser, yeah...

51:52.971 --> 51:55.307
I want to see him today.

51:55.432 --> 51:56.495
What do you think?

51:56.600 --> 51:59.248
I think it's time
I had a word with Mr. Brodie...

51:59.352 --> 52:03.732
after I've interviewed Fraser.
There's something else I want you to do.

52:04.065 --> 52:07.465
Before he left the hotel,
Sullivan wrote a list of names.

52:07.569 --> 52:09.696
I want you to check them.

52:10.030 --> 52:13.909
The connection is obvious.
Famous punters, what have you.

52:14.784 --> 52:17.203
I want something more specific.

52:17.746 --> 52:21.374
- Has Brodie seen this?
- No. We'll keep it in the family.

52:27.964 --> 52:29.382
538, please.

52:32.928 --> 52:36.056
Here's your key,
and there's a message for you as well.

54:00.515 --> 54:03.226
- Hiya. Come on in.
- Thanks.

54:12.444 --> 54:13.612
Hey.

54:15.030 --> 54:16.907
- Kevin.
- Here you are.

54:17.657 --> 54:19.034
Thanks.

54:19.284 --> 54:22.704
Look, I was really sorry
to hear about Mr. Sullivan.

54:23.079 --> 54:24.456
Thanks.

54:27.542 --> 54:29.023
Do you smoke?

54:29.127 --> 54:32.589
- Here.
- Yes. Thanks.

54:33.548 --> 54:36.217
- So is it just you and Kevin?
- Yeah.

54:36.760 --> 54:39.471
His dad's doing 12 years in the Kesh.

54:40.931 --> 54:41.765
What for?

54:42.557 --> 54:45.393
Possession of arms and IRA membership.

54:45.727 --> 54:49.460
He was doing a punishment for the IRA
on some local gangsters...

54:49.564 --> 54:54.110
who were robbin' their own community,
and he got caught by the RUC.

54:54.736 --> 54:57.697
Just like him.
He never did have much luck.

54:59.282 --> 55:03.245
So you said in your note
that you might have some information.

55:03.536 --> 55:05.830
I'm just delivering a message.

55:06.581 --> 55:09.918
Harris wants to meet you
and the policeman Kerrigan.

55:10.752 --> 55:12.712
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

55:14.297 --> 55:17.717
Look, after what's happened,
can you trust Kerrigan?

55:18.593 --> 55:23.473
- Yeah, I trust him. I think he's different.
- Anyway, Harris wants him there.

55:24.516 --> 55:28.144
You're to meet at a Republican club
off Falls Road. I have the address.

55:28.937 --> 55:31.001
Will Kerrigan be safe
in a Republican club?

55:31.106 --> 55:34.276
He'll be safe as long
as you're with him.

55:34.859 --> 55:37.988
I'll get you that photograph
I told you about.

55:40.240 --> 55:41.741
This is it.

55:43.535 --> 55:45.870
He's an officer in the SAS.

55:46.663 --> 55:49.270
He led a killer squad across the border.

55:49.374 --> 55:51.793
That's where this photograph was taken.

56:00.343 --> 56:03.242
Is there anything
in Sgt. Kennedy's statement...

56:03.346 --> 56:06.099
you disagree with, Superintendent?

56:07.017 --> 56:08.393
No, sir.

56:08.685 --> 56:12.147
He says that you instructed
him to lie to the CID...

56:12.731 --> 56:16.151
about the shooting of Paul Sullivan
and Frank Molloy. Is this true?

56:17.736 --> 56:19.717
It was to protect
our source of information.

56:19.821 --> 56:23.137
- Can you tell me what that source was?
- That's classified information.

56:23.241 --> 56:26.494
- On whose orders?
- On the orders of Mr. Brodie.

56:29.873 --> 56:33.627
When your men returned to the barracks,
they were given a debriefing.

56:33.877 --> 56:36.379
Were they given a cover-up story?

56:37.380 --> 56:39.570
Certain evidence was withheld, yes.

56:39.674 --> 56:43.428
A dress rehearsal, so they could
decide what to tell the CID?

56:44.971 --> 56:46.765
- Yes, sir.
- By you?

56:47.933 --> 56:50.810
Yes, sir, but I was acting under orders.

56:53.772 --> 56:55.690
This Englishman...

56:57.400 --> 57:00.028
tall, thinning hair, about 40...

57:00.820 --> 57:03.156
who took the tape, who is he?

57:04.324 --> 57:06.910
- Don't know, sir.
- Have you seen him before?

57:09.329 --> 57:11.456
Once, with Mr. Brodie.

57:11.790 --> 57:13.083
Where?

57:14.376 --> 57:16.378
Here, in this building.

57:17.045 --> 57:20.840
- Did he show you his authority?
- No, sir.

57:22.050 --> 57:24.719
He just walked in and took the tape?

57:25.512 --> 57:28.390
I received a phone call from Mr. Brodie.

57:29.057 --> 57:30.642
He told you to give it to him?

57:32.143 --> 57:33.561
Yes, sir.

57:35.939 --> 57:38.400
- Would you mind if I smoke, sir?
- Yes, I do.

57:56.001 --> 57:57.502
Go!

57:58.003 --> 57:59.254
Move! Move it!

57:59.629 --> 58:01.590
Get out of here!

58:02.674 --> 58:05.594
- Police!
- Get out of my house!

58:07.304 --> 58:10.619
- There's nobody in there! Just get out!
- Get inside, get in there.

58:10.724 --> 58:13.956
What do you want? My baby's in there.
Don't let them go in there!

58:14.060 --> 58:16.417
I'm arresting you under
the Emergency Provisions Act.

58:16.521 --> 58:19.378
- Get your clothes on now!
- What are they doing?

58:19.482 --> 58:20.921
My baby's in the other room.

58:21.026 --> 58:23.549
Okay, that's too bad.
Get your clothes on!

58:23.653 --> 58:26.343
- No! What are you arresting me for?
- Get your clothes on.

58:26.448 --> 58:29.680
- I'm arresting you under Section 11!
- I haven't done anything!

58:29.784 --> 58:33.350
- We'll see about that!
- Will you, now? I'm going nowhere!

58:33.455 --> 58:35.603
Tell him to get out of there!
My baby's in there!

58:35.707 --> 58:38.668
- Get your clothes on now!
- I'm putting no clothes on!

58:42.339 --> 58:44.653
Get off!

58:44.758 --> 58:47.135
- You bitch!
- Get off!

58:49.971 --> 58:52.953
- Get off me!
- Just calm down!

58:53.058 --> 58:55.081
I'm going nowhere
until I've seen a solicitor!

58:55.185 --> 58:58.939
- Just calm down! Open the door, Sam.
- What about my baby next door?

58:59.189 --> 59:01.524
Open that door. We're going downtown.

59:02.108 --> 59:04.444
- I'm going nowhere!
- Hold her!

59:13.078 --> 59:16.331
- Has Brodie's office returned my call yet?
- No.

59:17.374 --> 59:19.000
Try again now.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.530
Mr. Kerrigan's secretary.

59:27.634 --> 59:31.054
Did you set up that appointment
with Mr. Brodie yet?

59:31.471 --> 59:34.683
Why not?
I've been trying since 12:00 yesterday.

59:36.851 --> 59:39.041
Excuse me. He can't meet you today.

59:39.145 --> 59:42.357
- He has an official engagement.
- Playing games.

59:43.483 --> 59:45.068
Find out when he's leaving.

59:46.403 --> 59:48.488
Is Mr. Brodie there now?

59:49.489 --> 59:52.242
What time's his appointment? Thank you.

59:52.909 --> 59:54.327
He's there until 2:30.

01:00:06.715 --> 01:00:09.947
Two statements:
Fraser's and Sgt. Kennedy's.

01:00:10.051 --> 01:00:13.221
- I'd like to see them.
- They'll be in my report.

01:00:13.388 --> 01:00:15.745
- And now you want to question me?
- Interview you.

01:00:15.849 --> 01:00:18.727
- Make an appointment.
- All right. When?

01:00:19.185 --> 01:00:22.397
- At my convenience.
- Will you get off your fuckin' high horse?

01:00:23.023 --> 01:00:26.026
I don't ask your cooperation!
I demand it!

01:00:27.986 --> 01:00:31.698
- What is it you want?
- Everything, chapter and verse.

01:00:32.616 --> 01:00:34.784
- That might not be possible.
- Why not?

01:00:35.035 --> 01:00:37.183
Give me your question,
and please try to hurry.

01:00:37.287 --> 01:00:39.727
I've got another funeral to attend.

01:00:39.831 --> 01:00:43.919
Both Superintendent Fraser and
Sgt. Kennedy admit there was a cover-up.

01:00:45.211 --> 01:00:48.194
- Fraser says you ordered it.
- Classified.

01:00:48.298 --> 01:00:49.737
Then the buck stops here?

01:00:49.841 --> 01:00:52.364
- It's classified.
- I can't accept that.

01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:55.347
Then put that in your report, too.
Next question.

01:00:55.889 --> 01:00:57.161
- He says...
- Who says?

01:00:57.265 --> 01:01:01.728
Fraser says
it was in order to protect the source.

01:01:02.103 --> 01:01:05.002
- That's acceptable.
- Not to me, it isn't.

01:01:05.106 --> 01:01:07.254
That's because
you have been meddling in things...

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:11.655
Meddling? I am conducting
an investigation, for Christ's Sake!

01:01:12.906 --> 01:01:15.137
Cover-up stories are used
to protect informants...

01:01:15.242 --> 01:01:17.869
whose lives might be endangered.

01:01:18.119 --> 01:01:19.329
Look.

01:01:19.496 --> 01:01:23.458
The last thing I want to do
is to probe into sensitive areas.

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:26.315
But these civil-liberties people
are organized.

01:01:26.419 --> 01:01:29.276
They're sending over a lawyer
from the States for the inquest.

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:30.361
So?

01:01:30.465 --> 01:01:33.030
They'll make mincemeat out of you.
They'll ask questions.

01:01:33.134 --> 01:01:35.136
I've got a couple questions of my own.

01:01:35.679 --> 01:01:37.243
There was no roadblock.

01:01:37.347 --> 01:01:39.870
No witnesses were questioned,
no resistance offered.

01:01:39.975 --> 01:01:42.123
The weapon found in the car
had no fingerprints.

01:01:42.227 --> 01:01:44.375
Forensic showed
the shot that killed Sullivan...

01:01:44.479 --> 01:01:48.712
was fired at a distance of two meters
after the car had crashed.

01:01:48.817 --> 01:01:51.215
The officers involved
were acting on the assumption...

01:01:51.319 --> 01:01:53.426
that both men were armed and dangerous.

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:54.948
Prove it.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.224
What was Sullivan doing in Dungannon
at 5:00 in the morning with Molloy?

01:02:00.328 --> 01:02:01.725
Was there a warrant out for them?

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:04.145
- No, there wasn't.
- Then you've no case.

01:02:04.249 --> 01:02:07.148
There's no law against
two men deciding to go out for a drive.

01:02:07.252 --> 01:02:10.234
When that comes out in court,
your cover story will be blown...

01:02:10.338 --> 01:02:13.487
because neither Kennedy nor Fraser
are prepared to carry the can.

01:02:13.592 --> 01:02:16.157
- That's for the DPP to decide.
- Will he have a choice?

01:02:16.261 --> 01:02:19.952
When that lawyer gets him at the inquest,
he'll squeeze him like toothpaste.

01:02:20.056 --> 01:02:23.080
Do you think I give a shit
about a smart-arsed American lawyer?

01:02:23.184 --> 01:02:25.040
I would, if I were you!

01:02:25.145 --> 01:02:29.774
Yes. The RUC do run covert operations,
but so do the IRA!

01:02:29.983 --> 01:02:33.612
If you want to bring home the bacon,
you first of all have to kill the pig.

01:02:34.696 --> 01:02:36.823
Now, if you will excuse me...

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.139
three of our young men
are being buried this morning.

01:02:40.243 --> 01:02:41.995
Blown up by a land mine.

01:02:44.956 --> 01:02:46.520
I have more questions.

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:49.106
Two of them were married
with young children.

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:50.962
I want that tape.

01:02:53.006 --> 01:02:54.028
What tape?

01:02:54.132 --> 01:02:58.011
The tape they found on Sullivan's body
and brought back to Gough Barracks.

01:02:58.762 --> 01:03:00.034
This Fraser again?

01:03:00.138 --> 01:03:02.078
And Kennedy.
It's in both their statements.

01:03:02.182 --> 01:03:04.330
- I don't have the tape.
- But you know who does.

01:03:04.434 --> 01:03:07.520
- Classified information.
- "Classified" bullshit!

01:03:07.812 --> 01:03:11.962
What the fuck are you people runnin'
here? Your own private shooting war?

01:03:12.067 --> 01:03:13.964
Checks and balances, Mr. Kerrigan.

01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:16.300
Between the jigs and the reels,
we are winning.

01:03:16.404 --> 01:03:19.241
And innocent lives are being saved
as a result!

01:03:20.075 --> 01:03:22.911
The source you wish to protect
is Army Intelligence.

01:03:23.078 --> 01:03:24.454
Am I right?

01:03:27.415 --> 01:03:29.480
- What did you say?
- I'll say it again quickly.

01:03:29.584 --> 01:03:31.690
Molloy and Sullivan
were killed for that tape...

01:03:31.795 --> 01:03:35.319
and Army Intelligence, Ml5, Ml6,
call it what you want, are involved...

01:03:35.423 --> 01:03:38.468
and I want to know why, Mr. Brodie.

01:03:38.802 --> 01:03:41.325
- Then take it up with them.
- You ordered it.

01:03:41.429 --> 01:03:44.328
My participation was limited
to policing the operation.

01:03:44.432 --> 01:03:47.102
- That will sound wonderful in court.
- What court?

01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:49.375
There will be accounting.
Charges will be made.

01:03:49.479 --> 01:03:51.585
- By you?
- I'll recommend it in my report.

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:54.004
Which I shall take
to the DPP for him to decide.

01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:55.381
- It won't work.
- What won't?

01:03:55.485 --> 01:03:57.571
Not at my expense, it won't.

01:03:57.821 --> 01:04:02.117
My God, you're catchin' the Irish disease.
You're gettin' paranoid.

01:04:02.409 --> 01:04:05.224
If necessary,
I'm prepared to resign over this...

01:04:05.328 --> 01:04:08.102
and start telling tales out of school.

01:04:08.206 --> 01:04:11.918
I don't think you will.
You're a career officer like me.

01:04:13.003 --> 01:04:15.651
- I mean it.
- You'd resign the force and go public?

01:04:15.755 --> 01:04:17.340
If I have to.

01:04:17.841 --> 01:04:21.678
Listen, we're both professionals.
We observe certain rules.

01:04:21.886 --> 01:04:23.763
Then understand.

01:04:24.014 --> 01:04:25.661
Without access to that tape...

01:04:25.765 --> 01:04:28.873
it is impossible for me
to evaluate the evidence.

01:04:28.977 --> 01:04:33.690
I'm afraid I can't help you there.
I have neither seen nor heard that tape.

01:04:33.857 --> 01:04:37.986
And frankly, I don't want the burden.
Now, if you will excuse me.

01:04:41.865 --> 01:04:43.450
Who's Harris?

01:04:45.035 --> 01:04:46.369
Harris?

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:48.955
I've never heard of him.

01:04:53.627 --> 01:04:57.380
Ms. McKechnie, will you show Mr. Kerrigan
out of my office, please?

01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:15.190
I wonder what Harris'
connection with the Provos is?

01:05:15.482 --> 01:05:18.422
- Why do you think he has one?
- Why else meet in an IRA club?

01:05:18.526 --> 01:05:20.716
- It's a Republican club.
- Same difference.

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.531
Not every Republican supports the IRA.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.181
Let's hope you're right.
I could be putting my head in a noose.

01:05:27.285 --> 01:05:29.454
I don't think you have to worry.

01:05:29.579 --> 01:05:32.311
You can count on the IRA
to be predictable.

01:05:32.415 --> 01:05:34.876
Yes. They shoot policemen.

01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:55.730
Did you lock the door?

01:06:19.588 --> 01:06:21.736
- Are you lookin' for someone?
- Teresa Doyle.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.029
- You have to be signed in by a member.
- Pardon?

01:06:24.134 --> 01:06:28.200
- You have to be signed in by a member.
- That's why I'm waiting for her to come.

01:06:28.305 --> 01:06:32.872
It's okay, Danny. I know these people.
I take full responsibility for them.

01:06:32.976 --> 01:06:35.291
Welcome to
the James Connolly Republican Club.

01:06:35.395 --> 01:06:38.377
I'm Liam Philbin, Sinn Fein rep
for this area and club secretary.

01:06:38.481 --> 01:06:39.670
Ingrid Jessner.

01:06:39.774 --> 01:06:41.234
Hello. Peter Kerrigan.

01:06:42.068 --> 01:06:44.175
- Got here okay, then?
- Yeah, fine, thanks.

01:06:44.279 --> 01:06:47.240
Would you like to buy a football ticket?
Football ticket.

01:06:47.574 --> 01:06:48.929
Never misses a trick.

01:06:49.034 --> 01:06:51.453
- Fifty pence.
- Four.

01:06:52.245 --> 01:06:53.288
Thank you.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.981
Congratulations. You've just contributed
to a fund for Republican prisoners.

01:06:59.085 --> 01:07:00.024
Thank you very much.

01:07:00.128 --> 01:07:02.276
- Here's a present.
- Down to you.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.820
- Shall we go in?
- Sure. Is Teresa here?

01:07:04.925 --> 01:07:07.698
- No, Teresa got lifted on Monday.
- Lifted? What for?

01:07:07.802 --> 01:07:10.347
Harassment. Happens all the time.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.161
- Is she all right?
- She's okay.

01:07:12.265 --> 01:07:14.872
- And the baby?
- They're being looked after.

01:07:14.976 --> 01:07:17.103
"In the Maidstone and the Maze

01:07:17.312 --> 01:07:21.274
"I thought about my land
throughout these days

01:07:22.067 --> 01:07:24.653
"Why my country was divided

01:07:24.945 --> 01:07:27.322
"Why I was now in jail

01:07:27.489 --> 01:07:31.243
"Imprisoned without crime
or without trial

01:07:32.619 --> 01:07:37.332
"And now I love my country
I am not a bitter man

"I've seen cruelty and injustice

01:07:43.338 --> 01:07:48.093
"And then one fateful mornin'
I shook bold freedom's hand

"For right or wrong,
I tried to free my land

"And you dare call me a terrorist

"When I think of all the deeds

"You have plundered many nations,

"You have terrorized their people
You've ruled with an iron hand

01:08:13.201 --> 01:08:17.122
"And you've brought
this reign of terror to my land

"You've brought
this reign of terror to my land"

01:08:50.404 --> 01:08:51.865
Thank you.

01:08:58.078 --> 01:09:00.665
Jimmy here's gonna do the next one.

01:09:03.292 --> 01:09:05.941
On the wall,
you see a picture of James Connolly...

01:09:06.046 --> 01:09:08.131
one of our greatest-ever Irish leaders.

01:09:08.256 --> 01:09:12.010
Connolly said, many years ago,
that England has no more moral right...

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.991
to administer Irish affairs...

01:09:14.095 --> 01:09:17.098
than it has to administer the affairs
of America or Japan.

01:09:17.432 --> 01:09:21.540
No more moral right to police us
than it has a moral right to shoot us.

01:09:21.645 --> 01:09:23.584
That is the answer: British withdrawal.

01:09:23.688 --> 01:09:25.106
That's the answer...

01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:29.631
but innocent people have been killed.

01:09:29.736 --> 01:09:33.469
Yes, innocent people have been killed
and are being killed.

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:36.388
But if you look at all the colonies,
for instance, America.

01:09:36.493 --> 01:09:38.933
George Washington was called
a terrorist in his time.

01:09:39.037 --> 01:09:43.145
Jomo Kenyatta was a terrorist.
Archbishop Makarios was a terrorist.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:46.732
Unfortunately, colonies appear
to have to fight for their freedom.

01:09:46.836 --> 01:09:49.568
It is never granted willingly.
They must struggle for it.

01:09:49.673 --> 01:09:51.006
Liam...

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:54.198
Do you know why Paul
was with Mr. Molloy that morning?

01:09:54.301 --> 01:09:57.743
Yes. Molloy was taking him
to meet Harris, in fact.

01:09:57.847 --> 01:09:59.933
- Where?
- At a safe house.

01:10:00.308 --> 01:10:01.372
That you provided?

01:10:01.476 --> 01:10:05.230
- Yes. Our interests coincided.
- In what way?

01:10:06.273 --> 01:10:08.858
Let's just say that our enemies
became his enemies.

01:10:09.317 --> 01:10:11.111
Where is he, Liam?

01:10:11.319 --> 01:10:15.428
He's out the back here, waitin' for you.
If you like, we'll go now and see him.

01:10:15.532 --> 01:10:17.784
- Yes.
- Good, then. Come on.

01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:26.897
"Gloucester's crumbling
pushed us westward

01:10:27.002 --> 01:10:30.276
"To liberate all the Irish
Some of us that came to fight

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.799
"From Tipperary mountainside"

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:38.388
Here's your visitors now.

01:10:39.431 --> 01:10:42.246
- Thank you, Liam.
- Okay. I'll leave you to it.

01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:43.602
Thank you.

01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:46.438
- Harris?
- Yes.

01:10:47.564 --> 01:10:51.151
- How much has Liam told you?
- Only that Molloy brought you here...

01:10:51.276 --> 01:10:54.258
and that you were sheltered by the IRA.

01:10:54.362 --> 01:10:57.782
- And you find that reprehensible?
- For Molloy? No.

01:10:58.074 --> 01:10:59.847
No. He has his loyalties.

01:10:59.951 --> 01:11:04.080
But for you, an officer serving
in the British Army, yes.

01:11:09.878 --> 01:11:12.651
I am terribly sorry about what happened.

01:11:12.756 --> 01:11:15.050
I really didn't think
they'd go that far.

01:11:15.926 --> 01:11:18.261
Why did you want to see Paul?

01:11:18.553 --> 01:11:22.307
- I gave him a tape. Didn't you know that?
- Not till later.

01:11:24.517 --> 01:11:26.165
Coming here could cost me my life.

01:11:26.269 --> 01:11:30.440
Mine, too, but unlike you,
I don't have the IRA to protect me.

01:11:30.565 --> 01:11:32.776
I gave the IRA nothing.

01:11:49.918 --> 01:11:52.983
I was an Army Intelligence officer
co-opted to work with Ml6...

01:11:53.088 --> 01:11:54.798
and Ml5 when they took over.

01:11:54.923 --> 01:11:56.299
PSYOPS.

01:11:56.758 --> 01:11:59.844
Our cover name was
"Information Policy Unit".

01:12:00.345 --> 01:12:03.494
Our official function was
to liaise with the press...

01:12:03.598 --> 01:12:06.643
and prepare public relations programs.

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:08.937
And unofficial?

01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:11.335
We had our own printing press.

01:12:11.439 --> 01:12:15.026
We'd forge documents
attributed to Republican sources.

01:12:15.318 --> 01:12:19.301
We'd provide material for the media:
Newspapers, magazines, television.

01:12:19.406 --> 01:12:20.970
- Black propaganda?
- Yes.

01:12:21.074 --> 01:12:23.076
What kind of material?

01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:26.350
Whatever we thought was necessary.

01:12:26.454 --> 01:12:29.791
We'd invent stories,
leak truths, leak lies...

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:31.501
leak half-truths.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.379
Accountable to the politicians.

01:12:36.172 --> 01:12:38.800
Let us get one thing straight, Kerrigan.

01:12:39.009 --> 01:12:41.157
We were accountable to no one.

01:12:41.261 --> 01:12:45.327
The Prime Minister, Parliament, the courts,
the great British public...

01:12:45.432 --> 01:12:49.352
It made no difference.
They were all there to be manipulated.

01:12:49.519 --> 01:12:53.607
- And that didn't bother you?
- Not against the IRA, it didn't.

01:12:54.608 --> 01:12:57.652
But during the election of '74...

01:12:59.154 --> 01:13:01.927
our work became increasingly political.

01:13:02.032 --> 01:13:04.054
Ml5 were running things.

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:06.369
Our long-term objectives were abandoned.

01:13:06.536 --> 01:13:10.123
The new emphasis was on
assassination teams, bounty hunters.

01:13:10.582 --> 01:13:13.168
But the PSYOPS unit
continued to operate?

01:13:13.418 --> 01:13:15.879
Yes, but with fresh targets.

01:13:16.963 --> 01:13:20.863
During the '70s, the Conservative Party
was demoralized and divided.

01:13:20.967 --> 01:13:22.948
They saw their party leader,
Edward Heath...

01:13:23.053 --> 01:13:26.410
cave in against the miners' strike
of '74 and were searching for...

01:13:26.514 --> 01:13:29.184
a new leader from the hard right.

01:13:31.603 --> 01:13:34.856
We circulated stories
about his private life.

01:13:35.565 --> 01:13:36.650
Heath was dumped.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.027
And replaced by Thatcher.

01:13:39.194 --> 01:13:41.217
Yeah, but that wasn't enough.

01:13:41.321 --> 01:13:43.928
There was concern
amongst business and the military...

01:13:44.032 --> 01:13:46.514
that Labour were heading for
a third term in office.

01:13:46.618 --> 01:13:49.100
The moderates would be replaced
by the left-wingers...

01:13:49.204 --> 01:13:52.686
who, in turn, would be opposed
to NATO and nuclear weapons.

01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:57.128
Remember, inflation was running rife,
industry was crippled by strikes.

01:13:57.462 --> 01:13:59.610
What is this leading up to?

01:13:59.714 --> 01:14:01.466
Treason, Mr. Kerrigan.

01:14:02.384 --> 01:14:05.699
Pressure came from the CIA
to get rid of the Labour government.

01:14:05.804 --> 01:14:06.846
Jesus.

01:14:07.222 --> 01:14:10.413
They fed information to Ml5
that Prime Minister Wilson...

01:14:10.517 --> 01:14:12.519
was a KGB agent.

01:14:12.894 --> 01:14:15.689
It was a joint CIA-Ml5 operation...

01:14:16.147 --> 01:14:18.191
supported by others in Whitehall.

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:21.695
Yeah, the whole bag
of dirty tricks was used:

01:14:22.612 --> 01:14:27.158
Smears, break-ins, burglaries,
phone-tapping, blackmail, disinformation.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.854
- If what you say is true...
- It all landed on my desk.

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:38.044
- And you believed it?
- I did when it was used by Alec Nevin...

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:41.318
the future Prime Minister's
closest political ally...

01:14:41.423 --> 01:14:45.072
the principal architect
of her victory over Edward Heath.

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:48.471
You're saying that Thatcher
was involved in this?

01:14:50.849 --> 01:14:53.852
No, but she was the main beneficiary.

01:14:55.937 --> 01:15:00.379
The files and documents I got from Ml5
I turned into articles and essays...

01:15:00.483 --> 01:15:02.444
for selected journalists...

01:15:02.736 --> 01:15:04.821
and speeches for Alec Nevin.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.952
- Why should I believe you?
- Because it's all on the tape.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.101
Why else do you think
they tried to get rid of me?

01:15:14.205 --> 01:15:16.687
If this comes out,
with Nevin's explicit connections...

01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:19.690
to the Prime Minister,
the spotlight falls on Number 10.

01:15:19.794 --> 01:15:23.006
- That's why his name is on the list.
- What list?

01:15:23.381 --> 01:15:25.759
Paul made a list of six names.

01:15:28.553 --> 01:15:31.368
- Do you have them with you?
- I took them.

01:15:31.473 --> 01:15:34.121
Then I suggest you study that list
very carefully.

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:36.811
- Why?
- Because they are the prime movers...

01:15:37.354 --> 01:15:41.087
Nevin's ideological counterparts
in business, industry, the military.

01:15:41.191 --> 01:15:43.130
Together they form the nucleus.

01:15:43.235 --> 01:15:45.382
Their priority was to
wreck Labour's chances

01:15:45.487 --> 01:15:47.134
of winning another general election...

01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:49.804
and if necessary,
were prepared to go even further.

01:15:49.908 --> 01:15:52.389
You want wrapping up in a blanket.

01:15:52.494 --> 01:15:56.060
Paul knew this. He heard the tape.
He had the tape.

01:15:56.164 --> 01:15:58.771
- That's why they murdered him.
- I think you're insane.

01:15:58.875 --> 01:15:59.897
I can prove it.

01:16:00.001 --> 01:16:03.546
- Why would he lie?
- I don't know: Guilt, pressure...

01:16:05.507 --> 01:16:07.113
acute paranoia.

01:16:07.217 --> 01:16:09.365
- I'm as sane as you are.
- And I believe him.

01:16:09.469 --> 01:16:11.409
It couldn't happen.

01:16:11.513 --> 01:16:12.847
It did.

01:16:24.901 --> 01:16:26.903
Why didn't you resign?

01:16:30.865 --> 01:16:32.909
I was a career officer.

01:16:34.119 --> 01:16:37.038
One hoped
that the situation would change.

01:16:38.206 --> 01:16:41.126
But I also saw what happened
to people in a similar position.

01:16:41.585 --> 01:16:43.336
Good men ruined.

01:16:43.461 --> 01:16:45.088
So you went along with it?

01:16:45.672 --> 01:16:46.840
No.

01:16:47.424 --> 01:16:51.636
I asked questions about it.
At first, they were very understanding.

01:16:51.845 --> 01:16:55.619
They said I was suffering from stress,
mental fatigue, physical exhaustion.

01:16:55.724 --> 01:16:57.913
That I needed a break
from Northern Ireland.

01:16:58.018 --> 01:16:59.790
So they sent me to the mainland...

01:16:59.894 --> 01:17:03.231
as an instructor
to the School of Intelligence.

01:17:06.026 --> 01:17:08.612
In late '77, I was posted back here.

01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:14.451
- How did they find out about this tape?
- Because I behaved stupidly.

01:17:14.784 --> 01:17:17.808
Instead of keeping my head down,
I had a row about it all.

01:17:17.913 --> 01:17:20.394
Consequently,
I was put under close surveillance.

01:17:20.498 --> 01:17:23.147
Mail was opened, phones were tapped.

01:17:23.251 --> 01:17:26.025
They searched my room
and found a backup copy of the tape...

01:17:26.129 --> 01:17:28.089
stitched in the lining of my beret.

01:17:28.256 --> 01:17:31.009
So I took the original tape and ran.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.595
Still running.

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:37.641
You say you have this tape?

01:17:38.725 --> 01:17:43.563
It's all there: Names, dates.
I bugged their meetings.

01:17:43.813 --> 01:17:45.669
I wanted Sullivan to publicize it.

01:17:45.774 --> 01:17:48.255
Being an American citizen
and a civil rights lawyer...

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.840
I thought he was beyond reach.

01:17:49.945 --> 01:17:51.571
You were wrong.

01:17:53.949 --> 01:17:57.556
I'm afraid media exposure
is the only protection I have.

01:17:57.661 --> 01:17:59.204
Do you have it with you?

01:18:01.665 --> 01:18:03.708
I have certain demands.

01:18:04.084 --> 01:18:05.064
What demands?

01:18:05.168 --> 01:18:08.275
When I deliver the tape,
I want to be taken into protective custody.

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.195
And I want you, Ms. Jessner,
to make it public.

01:18:11.299 --> 01:18:13.364
- Agreed.
- I can't do that.

01:18:13.468 --> 01:18:14.844
Why not?

01:18:15.637 --> 01:18:19.599
Because he's not under my authority.
He's military personnel.

01:18:19.766 --> 01:18:23.541
You were brought here
to investigate Paul Sullivan's death.

01:18:23.645 --> 01:18:26.398
He was murdered because of that tape.

01:18:28.525 --> 01:18:31.486
- Where is it?
- Do I have your agreement?

01:18:34.739 --> 01:18:35.949
Yes.

01:18:39.452 --> 01:18:40.787
Dublin.

01:18:41.162 --> 01:18:43.102
The IRA found me a safe house.

01:18:43.206 --> 01:18:45.646
They're hoping I'll come
to a prearranged meeting...

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:47.565
and denounce British imperialism.

01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:50.109
- When can we have it?
- You'll have to come to Dublin.

01:18:50.213 --> 01:18:52.111
- When?
- Day after tomorrow.

01:18:52.215 --> 01:18:53.508
Where?

01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:58.471
- O'Connell Bridge, 11:00 a.m.
- We'll be there.

01:19:02.642 --> 01:19:04.269
One last thing.

01:19:04.978 --> 01:19:06.730
Nevin has a man working for him.

01:19:06.855 --> 01:19:10.066
His name is McKee,
a former member of the SAS.

01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:14.029
- Look out for him.
- What's he look like?

01:19:14.946 --> 01:19:18.116
Big man, tall, bland face,
thinning hair.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.162
He's quite ruthless,
capable of anything.

01:19:39.721 --> 01:19:43.245
Am I wrong, Mr. Kerrigan,
or is it illegal to kill people...

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:44.914
and try to steal a country?

01:19:45.018 --> 01:19:48.813
Don't assume it happened
just because Harris said it did.

01:19:49.147 --> 01:19:52.171
Paul's dead! Molloy's dead!
That happened.

01:19:52.275 --> 01:19:55.320
Save your outrage
till we've heard the tape.

01:19:59.991 --> 01:20:02.223
- Good evening, love.
- Good evening, sir.

01:20:02.327 --> 01:20:03.328
Thank you.

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:06.998
- Have you seen Mr. Maxwell?
- He's in the bar, sir.

01:20:16.675 --> 01:20:19.761
- How'd it go?
- It was interesting.

01:20:20.262 --> 01:20:21.659
Did you see Harris?

01:20:21.763 --> 01:20:23.890
Yes. He didn't have the tape.

01:20:24.474 --> 01:20:26.726
You've had a call from Ml5.

01:20:26.977 --> 01:20:28.937
The spook department?

01:20:29.813 --> 01:20:32.065
- Who?
- Sir Robert Neil.

01:20:32.274 --> 01:20:36.570
He wants to meet you for lunch tomorrow.
He's sending his car at 12:00.

01:20:39.698 --> 01:20:42.617
- Time for a drink?
- No. I've had enough.

01:20:43.451 --> 01:20:45.412
You two okay?

01:20:46.496 --> 01:20:49.165
- Yes, thank you, Mr. Kerrigan.
- Fine.

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.169
- Mind how you go.
- See you in the morning.

01:21:20.488 --> 01:21:23.491
- Good morning, Mr. Kerrigan.
- Good morning.

01:21:28.413 --> 01:21:30.060
- Come in, Mr. Kerrigan.
- Sir Robert.

01:21:30.165 --> 01:21:32.292
Marvelous day. This way.

01:21:39.591 --> 01:21:40.926
Do you know Alec Nevin?

01:21:41.801 --> 01:21:44.241
No, I don't believe we've met.

01:21:44.346 --> 01:21:47.203
I'm delighted to meet you.
I've heard a great deal about you.

01:21:47.307 --> 01:21:48.934
How do you do?

01:21:49.184 --> 01:21:52.187
- Sherry?
- No, thank you.

01:22:09.287 --> 01:22:11.831
You've got your coffee, have you?

01:22:12.749 --> 01:22:17.295
So, Mr. Kerrigan,
how has your inquiry progressed?

01:22:19.214 --> 01:22:21.904
Sullivan and Molloy were killed
because of a tape.

01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:23.510
What tape?

01:22:23.969 --> 01:22:25.408
According to a Capt. Harris...

01:22:25.512 --> 01:22:27.493
- You've met him?
- Last night.

01:22:27.597 --> 01:22:29.015
Go on.

01:22:30.267 --> 01:22:33.395
- Your name surfaced, Mr. Nevin.
- Really?

01:22:35.563 --> 01:22:39.130
He claims that he possesses a tape
which will prove that you and others...

01:22:39.234 --> 01:22:42.821
conspired to destabilize
the last Labour government.

01:22:44.239 --> 01:22:47.054
He says he gave a copy of this tape
to Paul Sullivan...

01:22:47.158 --> 01:22:50.412
hoping he would publicize it,
and that's why Sullivan was killed.

01:22:50.787 --> 01:22:55.458
- You've not heard the tape then?
- Not yet, but I will.

01:22:56.084 --> 01:22:59.296
- You're seeing Harris again?
- I can't tell you.

01:23:00.839 --> 01:23:03.779
Although he was strictly Army,
Harris worked for me.

01:23:03.883 --> 01:23:05.885
Yes, I know.

01:23:07.762 --> 01:23:11.933
- He was rather good at what he did.
- He was a traitorous bastard.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.998
When I arrived just now...

01:23:14.102 --> 01:23:17.918
there was a man who greeted me
at the car: Tall, thinning hair.

01:23:18.023 --> 01:23:20.880
- What about him?
- I might want to question him.

01:23:20.984 --> 01:23:23.674
After the tape was taken
from Sullivan's body...

01:23:23.778 --> 01:23:26.677
the police gave it to someone
answering his description.

01:23:26.781 --> 01:23:30.681
I have four witnesses to identify him.
Did he give the tape to you?

01:23:30.785 --> 01:23:34.205
- Are you interrogating me?
- Are you obstructing me?

01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:41.129
If you let me listen to that tape,
I can eliminate Harris from my inquiry.

01:23:42.047 --> 01:23:43.673
You have no choice, Alec.

01:23:44.674 --> 01:23:47.928
Do you remember the
disorders of the 1970s...

01:23:48.637 --> 01:23:50.034
Mr. Kerrigan?

01:23:50.138 --> 01:23:52.349
The kind of chaos we faced...

01:23:52.724 --> 01:23:54.893
strikes, riots...

01:23:55.685 --> 01:23:58.918
miners bringing down
a Conservative government...

01:23:59.022 --> 01:24:03.214
inflation going through the roof,
our European creditors...

01:24:03.318 --> 01:24:05.111
queuing up to pounce on us?

01:24:05.528 --> 01:24:08.448
How Europe enjoyed our discomfiture.

01:24:10.283 --> 01:24:12.953
Instead of just letting it happen...

01:24:14.204 --> 01:24:17.707
a few of us got together
to do something about it.

01:24:17.999 --> 01:24:20.794
So there was a conspiracy.

01:24:21.378 --> 01:24:25.986
- My dear chap, politics is a conspiracy.
- The point is, our paths converge.

01:24:26.091 --> 01:24:28.739
- In what way?
- We both serve the state.

01:24:28.843 --> 01:24:31.554
No, I defend the state.

01:24:32.264 --> 01:24:33.911
You subvert it.

01:24:34.015 --> 01:24:37.102
All right, let's be frank
with one another.

01:24:37.727 --> 01:24:42.440
Illegal methods were used in an attempt
to bring down the Labour government.

01:24:42.565 --> 01:24:44.859
But that's all in the past.

01:24:44.985 --> 01:24:48.008
Do you think by scrutinizing
mistakes made...

01:24:48.113 --> 01:24:51.408
you'll help restore
respect for law and order?

01:24:53.118 --> 01:24:56.037
Don't play hide and seek
with reality, Mr. Kerrigan.

01:24:56.746 --> 01:25:00.375
If you want to see the release of that
tape, and its contents made public...

01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:02.106
go right ahead.

01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:04.462
But first, consider the consequences.

01:25:04.963 --> 01:25:07.653
Every agitator, every intellectual...

01:25:07.757 --> 01:25:11.115
every bleeding-heart liberal
with his rhetoric about civil rights...

01:25:11.219 --> 01:25:12.950
will seize on it.

01:25:13.054 --> 01:25:15.640
Now, you say you defend the state.

01:25:16.308 --> 01:25:17.350
So do I.

01:25:17.976 --> 01:25:21.313
But Parliament and its institutions
are the state.

01:25:21.479 --> 01:25:24.357
And anything that threatens
the government...

01:25:24.733 --> 01:25:28.153
the rule of law,
the credibility of Parliament...

01:25:28.403 --> 01:25:30.697
is a threat to the state.

01:25:31.406 --> 01:25:33.825
Leave well alone, Mr. Kerrigan.

01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:37.245
Let the historians discover it
in 50 years' time.

01:25:38.622 --> 01:25:41.937
- Our duty is to protect Number 10.
- It wouldn't be published anyway.

01:25:42.042 --> 01:25:44.857
Strictly speaking,
it's none of your concern.

01:25:44.961 --> 01:25:47.443
It's an intelligence matter,
outside your jurisdiction.

01:25:47.547 --> 01:25:49.612
- I don't accept that.
- Accept this...

01:25:49.716 --> 01:25:53.157
What Alec and the others did
eight years ago was terribly wrong.

01:25:53.261 --> 01:25:56.494
It wasn't just terribly wrong.
It was criminal.

01:25:56.598 --> 01:25:59.121
It was wrong for the right reasons.

01:25:59.225 --> 01:26:02.583
These were, and still are,
honorable men.

01:26:02.687 --> 01:26:05.649
- They broke the law.
- We've agreed on that.

01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:08.839
But tell me,
as a professional policeman...

01:26:08.944 --> 01:26:13.052
don't you find that hardened criminals
often benefit from the restraints...

01:26:13.156 --> 01:26:15.763
imposed on the police by the courts?

01:26:15.867 --> 01:26:17.181
Absolutely, yes.

01:26:17.285 --> 01:26:22.082
And when, to secure a conviction,
the police remove those constraints...

01:26:22.457 --> 01:26:25.689
when, for example,
they illegally tap a phone...

01:26:25.794 --> 01:26:30.382
to apprehend political terrorists
whose aim is to overthrow democracy...

01:26:31.466 --> 01:26:33.510
is this ever justified?

01:26:34.177 --> 01:26:36.179
It depends on the circumstances.

01:26:36.638 --> 01:26:38.723
Let's be more specific.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:42.269
In 1974,
the IRA blew up a Birmingham pub.

01:26:42.894 --> 01:26:46.648
21 young people were killed.
162 were injured.

01:26:47.649 --> 01:26:52.112
The police, your colleagues,
arrested six Irishmen.

01:26:53.363 --> 01:26:56.470
They were subjected to
what is euphemistically referred to...

01:26:56.575 --> 01:26:58.368
as "in-depth interrogation".

01:26:58.827 --> 01:27:01.058
They kicked the hell out of
the murdering swine.

01:27:01.162 --> 01:27:04.624
- And obtained a confession.
- Which held up in court.

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:06.960
Was that justified?

01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:09.942
If they did that,
then they were out of order.

01:27:10.046 --> 01:27:11.902
Tell that to the people of Birmingham.

01:27:12.007 --> 01:27:13.821
The point I'm trying to make...

01:27:13.925 --> 01:27:17.241
I understand the point
you're trying to make, Sir Robert.

01:27:17.345 --> 01:27:21.141
That to maintain the system, the abuse
of power is sometimes necessary.

01:27:21.266 --> 01:27:22.475
Yes.

01:27:22.892 --> 01:27:26.855
It allows us to enjoy the freedom
of living in a free society.

01:27:27.897 --> 01:27:30.734
A price the public are prepared to pay.

01:27:31.318 --> 01:27:33.528
That's a dangerous concept.

01:27:33.737 --> 01:27:35.697
But a realistic one.

01:27:38.783 --> 01:27:41.015
You're forgetting one thing.

01:27:41.119 --> 01:27:43.601
What's to stop Harris
from making copies of the tape?

01:27:43.705 --> 01:27:48.397
Nothing at all, except without Harris,
there's no authenticity, no documentation.

01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:51.546
Everyone would think it was an IRA fake.

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:55.008
And my investigation?

01:27:55.967 --> 01:27:59.638
I have a solution
that is both effective and acceptable.

01:28:00.055 --> 01:28:03.141
You have the culprits
that did the shooting.

01:28:03.808 --> 01:28:05.268
Nail them.

01:28:13.944 --> 01:28:16.238
It really is a gorgeous day.

01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:20.867
You know, Ireland would be a lovely place
if it wasn't for the Irish.

01:28:24.996 --> 01:28:27.916
Was Ms. Jessner with you
when you met Harris?

01:28:28.124 --> 01:28:29.209
Yes.

01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:32.629
I wonder why Harris chose Paul Sullivan.

01:28:35.257 --> 01:28:38.656
Did you know, before she met him,
she lived with a Communist?

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:41.325
- No, I didn't.
- It was all rather sad.

01:28:41.429 --> 01:28:43.932
A Chilean. She had an abortion.

01:28:46.935 --> 01:28:49.729
There is something I want to show you.

01:28:54.985 --> 01:28:57.362
Not very pleasant, I'm afraid.

01:29:03.076 --> 01:29:06.746
Liam Philbin.
Served seven years in H-Block.

01:29:07.247 --> 01:29:09.749
Suspected of murdering two policemen.

01:29:10.834 --> 01:29:13.983
That's you making a contribution
to IRA funds...

01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:16.256
unintentionally, of course.

01:29:18.717 --> 01:29:20.969
These make my stomach turn.

01:29:24.389 --> 01:29:27.934
Alec wanted to turn them over
to his newspaper friends.

01:29:28.059 --> 01:29:30.145
I persuaded him not to.

01:29:30.645 --> 01:29:33.690
Apart from the damage
it could do to your career...

01:29:34.774 --> 01:29:37.527
I'm a family man myself, Mr. Kerrigan.

01:29:38.236 --> 01:29:42.198
I know the harm this sort of thing
can do to a happy marriage.

01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:44.659
Take them.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.578
Who keeps the negatives?

01:29:47.662 --> 01:29:49.414
Alec keeps them.

01:29:52.751 --> 01:29:54.169
Fuck you.

01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:00.133
First, they threw the book at me.

01:30:00.508 --> 01:30:02.281
Not in the national interest.

01:30:02.385 --> 01:30:04.054
Violation of security.

01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:05.639
Then...

01:30:07.682 --> 01:30:11.019
this infantile,
laughable comic-book stuff.

01:30:13.438 --> 01:30:15.857
Don't underestimate it, Peter.

01:30:17.525 --> 01:30:21.905
I've been a policeman for 26 years.
I've never met anything like this.

01:30:25.492 --> 01:30:28.140
If you go to Dublin,
see him, get the tape.

01:30:28.245 --> 01:30:30.684
Neil would argue
it was used for intelligence...

01:30:30.789 --> 01:30:34.542
and that it couldn't be admitted
in court as evidence.

01:30:36.086 --> 01:30:38.234
So what are we left with?

01:30:38.338 --> 01:30:39.360
The shooting.

01:30:39.464 --> 01:30:41.570
Which is flameproof.
We have the statements...

01:30:41.675 --> 01:30:43.885
Which we can make stick...

01:30:44.594 --> 01:30:47.451
provided we make
no references to the tape.

01:30:47.555 --> 01:30:49.808
Concession offered by Neil.

01:30:54.187 --> 01:30:55.480
Jesus.

01:30:56.898 --> 01:30:58.900
What does that make me?

01:31:01.069 --> 01:31:04.051
I came here as the cop
that couldn't be bought.

01:31:04.155 --> 01:31:07.867
- Nobody bought you.
- I've been manipulated from day one...

01:31:08.785 --> 01:31:10.870
put through the hoop.

01:31:17.085 --> 01:31:21.047
What happens if I choose
to take this to the limit...

01:31:23.675 --> 01:31:25.677
to the powers that be?

01:31:26.928 --> 01:31:29.055
What support would I get?

01:31:30.557 --> 01:31:32.017
Too risky.

01:31:32.726 --> 01:31:35.875
You blow the whistle,
when the shouting stopped...

01:31:35.979 --> 01:31:38.502
they reach an accommodation...

01:31:38.607 --> 01:31:40.483
you're finished.

01:31:42.235 --> 01:31:44.738
You know, Tom, I think I am naive.

01:31:45.447 --> 01:31:46.385
I've always believed...

01:31:46.489 --> 01:31:49.346
that given half a chance,
the system would work.

01:31:49.451 --> 01:31:52.183
Look, we've got the men
who did the shooting.

01:31:52.287 --> 01:31:54.831
- Everything I've stood for...
- Our job's done.

01:31:54.956 --> 01:31:56.082
No.

01:31:57.125 --> 01:31:59.002
That's unacceptable.

01:32:00.795 --> 01:32:04.132
I walk away from this,
it's a lifetime wasted.

01:32:06.593 --> 01:32:07.907
They want this thing buried...

01:32:08.011 --> 01:32:10.534
and if necessary,
they will bury you alongside it.

01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:13.746
- But there was a conspiracy.
- What proof have we got?

01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:16.394
- Neil admitted it.
- He'll deny it.

01:32:16.937 --> 01:32:19.773
That conversation never took place.

01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:25.487
Turn your back on this, Peter.

01:32:30.158 --> 01:32:33.078
What about Ingrid Jessner?
What about her?

01:32:33.245 --> 01:32:34.996
Not your problem.

01:32:35.747 --> 01:32:39.480
This is all politics.
We have the men that did the shooting.

01:32:39.584 --> 01:32:41.816
Are you willing to settle for that?

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.797
What else is there?

01:32:44.506 --> 01:32:45.966
And if I persist?

01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:49.719
Then you're on a hiding to nothing.

01:32:51.179 --> 01:32:52.806
What about you?

01:32:54.015 --> 01:32:56.643
- I'm a career policeman.
- So was I.

01:33:01.231 --> 01:33:03.024
I'm sorry, Peter.

01:33:03.316 --> 01:33:06.528
I'm not prepared to risk my future,
not in this.

01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:12.492
Thanks, Tom.

01:33:13.785 --> 01:33:16.037
You've just proved my point.

01:34:18.016 --> 01:34:20.998
Listen, if a Mr. Kerrigan calls,
will you tell him I've left?

01:34:21.102 --> 01:34:23.188
- Yes, certainly.
- Thanks.

01:34:23.605 --> 01:34:26.337
Ms. Jessner?
I'm Mr. Kerrigan's secretary.

01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:28.777
He asked me to give you that.

01:34:43.625 --> 01:34:45.126
Any message?

01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:48.755
- When's his flight?
- Mid-afternoon, I expect.

01:34:50.423 --> 01:34:51.758
Thanks.

01:35:08.191 --> 01:35:10.068
Echo 1 to Control.

01:35:10.443 --> 01:35:13.613
- Go ahead, Echo 1.
- We're on the Dublin Road.

01:35:15.073 --> 01:35:17.158
Are the others in place?

01:35:18.535 --> 01:35:19.744
Yes.

01:35:20.328 --> 01:35:22.289
Signing off now, Control.

01:35:23.164 --> 01:35:26.063
Give it another minute,
then overtake her quite quickly.

01:35:26.167 --> 01:35:28.378
I want to get ahead of her.

01:35:42.058 --> 01:35:43.643
Come in, Echo 2.

01:35:44.019 --> 01:35:45.145
Echo 2.

01:35:45.854 --> 01:35:50.254
- Is everything all right, Echo 2?
- Yes, she's about 200 yards in front of me.

01:35:50.358 --> 01:35:53.299
In a little while you'll see
a petrol station on your left.

01:35:53.403 --> 01:35:56.364
You pull in,
and I'll take up the follow.

01:36:45.914 --> 01:36:47.374
Echo 2...

01:36:48.083 --> 01:36:49.647
she's making for the bridge.

01:36:49.751 --> 01:36:51.732
I'm having trouble
gettin' through this lot.

01:36:51.836 --> 01:36:53.338
Bang your fucking horn, man!

01:37:17.737 --> 01:37:19.385
- Where's Kerrigan?
- I don't know.

01:37:19.489 --> 01:37:22.054
- That's no answer.
- I know, I don't know where he is.

01:37:22.158 --> 01:37:23.660
Let's walk.

01:37:26.663 --> 01:37:29.666
- You'll see that it's published?
- I'll try.

01:37:32.335 --> 01:37:34.129
Don't let me down.

01:37:34.921 --> 01:37:36.298
Trust me.

01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:37.591
I do.

01:38:24.638 --> 01:38:26.264
Where to, love?

01:38:28.016 --> 01:38:30.664
- I have to hire a car.
- You want a car-hire place?

01:38:30.769 --> 01:38:33.084
- Yeah.
- Which one in particular do you want?

01:38:33.188 --> 01:38:36.253
- Any one in particular?
- No. It doesn't matter. You decide.

01:38:36.358 --> 01:38:39.840
Do you want an expensive car
or a cheap car?

01:38:39.945 --> 01:38:41.425
It doesn't matter. I don't care.

01:38:41.529 --> 01:38:44.804
Look, I've had Americans before.
I just want to know what type car...

01:38:44.908 --> 01:38:45.992
Just go.

01:38:46.701 --> 01:38:48.015
It doesn't matter! Just go!

01:38:48.119 --> 01:38:50.810
Okay. There's a friend of mine
over at one place.

01:38:50.914 --> 01:38:53.145
- Fine.
- I'll bring you there, will I?

01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:54.376
Fine. Great.

01:39:06.388 --> 01:39:09.036
What you will hear on this tape
is a conversation...

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:11.622
which took place at the home
of Mr. Alec Nevin.

01:39:11.726 --> 01:39:14.417
Its purpose was to establish
a Conservative government...

01:39:14.521 --> 01:39:17.753
with a right-wing leadership.
I had shown support...

01:39:17.857 --> 01:39:20.318
and therefore was invited
to attend the meeting.

01:39:20.527 --> 01:39:23.530
I wore a recording device
activated by voice.

01:39:25.615 --> 01:39:29.077
Letting people off the leash a bit,
in that direction...

01:39:29.744 --> 01:39:33.436
the military and our friends
in the intelligence community...

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:37.815
is really enhancing the case
for quite dramatic...

01:39:37.919 --> 01:39:41.068
constitutional resolution
of this crisis...

01:39:41.172 --> 01:39:43.320
Indeed.
Don't underestimate the flexibility...

01:39:43.425 --> 01:39:47.324
We need to pressure the Palace into
giving legitimacy to what we need to do.

01:39:47.429 --> 01:39:50.119
Indeed. You underestimate,
we all underestimate...

01:39:50.223 --> 01:39:54.686
the flexibility of this constitution
of ours. We can do almost anything.

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.647
What are his weaknesses?

01:39:58.315 --> 01:40:00.609
What can we have circulated?

01:40:01.735 --> 01:40:04.905
And what rumors can we make stick?

01:40:05.238 --> 01:40:09.180
We all know about Heath.
We all know what we think about him.

01:40:09.284 --> 01:40:13.204
We should look to 5 to...

01:40:13.997 --> 01:40:15.457
assist in this matter.

01:40:16.458 --> 01:40:19.502
Can you try
Ms. Jessner's room again, please?

01:40:23.715 --> 01:40:25.592
Have you paged her?

01:40:27.469 --> 01:40:29.846
No. No message. Thanks.

01:40:31.222 --> 01:40:34.100
- I don't suppose we'll be needing this?
- What's that?

01:40:34.267 --> 01:40:37.708
It's the dossier you asked me to prepare
on those six names.

01:40:37.812 --> 01:40:39.147
Thanks.

01:40:40.732 --> 01:40:42.192
Insurance.

01:40:42.567 --> 01:40:46.488
- Shall I take the luggage down now, sir?
- Please do.

01:41:01.336 --> 01:41:03.213
It isn't your fault.

01:41:05.882 --> 01:41:08.093
They must have followed her.

01:41:09.761 --> 01:41:12.722
I'll pick up the rest
of this stuff later.

01:41:14.391 --> 01:41:17.519
- You know about Harris?
- I heard on the radio.

01:41:18.144 --> 01:41:20.751
They kneecapped him,
then they blew half his head away.

01:41:20.855 --> 01:41:22.607
Typical IRA execution.

01:41:28.655 --> 01:41:30.719
- What about Ingrid Jessner?
- What about her?

01:41:30.824 --> 01:41:32.888
- You know, if this thing leaks out...
- It won't.

01:41:32.993 --> 01:41:34.869
A crime has been committed.

01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:38.686
- What crime is that?
- I'm not just talkin' about Harris.

01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:41.251
Everything is covered
by the Official Secrets Act.

01:41:41.418 --> 01:41:46.006
- God, you people live in the Dark Ages.
- And what about you? Listen...

01:41:46.381 --> 01:41:48.779
You and I are cut from the same cloth.

01:41:48.883 --> 01:41:51.219
I am what I have to be, but you?

01:41:51.511 --> 01:41:55.411
You're no better.
Like me, you observe rule Number 1.

01:41:55.515 --> 01:41:57.517
Keep your balls intact.

01:41:58.268 --> 01:42:02.105
Have a good flight.
And don't forget to send me that report.

01:42:02.355 --> 01:42:03.815
Okey-doke?

01:42:05.317 --> 01:42:08.340
We need to get
some agent provocateurs into these...

01:42:08.445 --> 01:42:11.969
strikes that are taking place,
local government strikes...

01:42:12.073 --> 01:42:14.305
to cause a lot of
unpleasantness and disruption.

01:42:14.409 --> 01:42:17.662
We need that to run through
until the election and give it a shot.

01:42:18.204 --> 01:42:21.082
The question is,
can we rely upon democracy?

01:42:21.416 --> 01:42:24.315
- Just my opinion, but...
- With a little push here and there.

01:42:24.419 --> 01:42:27.610
Well, I agree with the little push.

01:42:27.714 --> 01:42:31.155
I agree that is the point, in a way,
why we're here, isn't it?

01:42:31.259 --> 01:42:35.743
If there's a run on the pound, that's fine.
If there's a lot of stuff circulating about...

01:42:35.847 --> 01:42:39.538
Wilson and Moscow,
which we all know to be the case...

01:42:39.643 --> 01:42:42.500
I think Wilson's somebody
we should home in very much on.

01:42:42.604 --> 01:42:45.231
A lot of stuff should be
circulated about Wilson.

01:42:51.988 --> 01:42:53.531
Ms. Jessner.

01:42:55.033 --> 01:42:56.910
She hasn't seen us.

01:42:58.828 --> 01:43:00.288
Wait here.

01:43:03.959 --> 01:43:04.939
What are you doing here?

01:43:05.043 --> 01:43:06.565
- Where were you?
- Did you get my note?

01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:08.984
- Why did you change your mind?
- There are reasons.

01:43:09.089 --> 01:43:12.008
- Tell me.
- I don't have to. I'm sorry.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.720
What about Mr. Nevin?

01:43:15.929 --> 01:43:17.284
What about Harris?

01:43:17.389 --> 01:43:19.057
Harris is dead.

01:43:19.391 --> 01:43:21.080
They're blaming the IRA.

01:43:21.184 --> 01:43:22.957
- But it was them!
- Please.

01:43:23.061 --> 01:43:26.314
- I saw it happen!
- Please, keep your voice down.

01:43:28.441 --> 01:43:30.798
- I told you not to go.
- You told me a lot of things...

01:43:30.902 --> 01:43:33.321
- Did you speak to Harris?
- Yes.

01:43:33.905 --> 01:43:37.325
- Did you tell them we were meeting?
- Of course not. You were followed!

01:43:37.576 --> 01:43:40.120
But you did talk to them. Why?

01:43:40.495 --> 01:43:43.060
- Did he give you the tape?
- You're not gonna...

01:43:43.164 --> 01:43:46.647
- Are you going to do anything about this?
- There's nothing I can do.

01:43:46.751 --> 01:43:48.732
They've committed murder and treason.

01:43:48.837 --> 01:43:51.318
At 11:00 this morning,
a man was assassinated...

01:43:51.423 --> 01:43:54.718
by orders of British Intelligence,
and you can do nothing!

01:43:54.843 --> 01:43:55.844
I wish I could.

01:43:56.428 --> 01:44:00.703
This is a final call for flight BTH-9
to London, Heathrow.

01:44:00.807 --> 01:44:02.455
You have connections I don't have.

01:44:02.559 --> 01:44:05.332
Your reputation brought you here.
People will listen to you.

01:44:05.437 --> 01:44:08.127
With you as my witness?
A civil-liberties group member...

01:44:08.231 --> 01:44:11.255
accusing the British government
of torture and shoot-to-kill?

01:44:11.359 --> 01:44:16.197
"I don't care whose toes I tread on".
That's what you said, and I believed it.

01:44:16.865 --> 01:44:19.555
- Look, I have to go.
- Go.

01:44:19.659 --> 01:44:21.536
- I'm a policeman.
- Yes, you are.

01:44:21.828 --> 01:44:24.268
The men responsible for Paul's death
will be charged.

01:44:24.372 --> 01:44:25.936
To know and do nothing.

01:44:26.041 --> 01:44:29.023
- You can't win against these people.
- To just close your eyes.

01:44:29.127 --> 01:44:30.524
Forget it. Go home.

01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:32.756
That's how fascism starts.

01:44:33.798 --> 01:44:36.322
What do you think
of your fine British law now?

01:44:36.426 --> 01:44:37.823
This has nothing to do with law.

01:44:37.928 --> 01:44:40.472
- What is it then?
- It's politics.

01:44:41.932 --> 01:44:45.122
To enforce the rules
of a police state is politics.

01:44:45.226 --> 01:44:47.792
Good guys like you cover it up
so bad guys are safe.

01:44:47.896 --> 01:44:50.690
You're a puppet, and the men
pulling the strings know it.

01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:53.443
Did he give you the tape?

01:44:53.902 --> 01:44:56.112
- No.
- What are you gonna do?

01:44:57.739 --> 01:44:59.866
Tell people, newspapers.

01:45:00.784 --> 01:45:02.786
- They won't print it.
- We'll see.

01:45:06.039 --> 01:45:07.832
Go back to America.

01:45:08.333 --> 01:45:11.294
Get out of Belfast.
You're in danger here.

01:45:13.713 --> 01:45:16.258
Ingrid, it's finished.

01:45:17.926 --> 01:45:21.388
Not for them, it isn't.
Not for Nevin and the others.

01:45:22.681 --> 01:45:26.268
They're not going to disappear.
They're still in place.

01:45:31.982 --> 01:45:34.317
You have a plane to catch, Mr. Kerrigan.

01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:55.422
What? Yes.
