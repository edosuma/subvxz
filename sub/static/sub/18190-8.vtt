WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:08.210
Take another's life and
I will end your misery.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.210
Ariadne plans to marry without
the blessing of the gods.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.570
You must stop the wedding.

00:17.620 --> 00:18.890
Why has Jason been arrested?

00:18.940 --> 00:21.450
He stands accused of
murdering the Oracle.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.600
Before Poseidon, you
are sentenced to death.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.240
Medusa?

00:59.340 --> 01:00.690
It's all right, it's all right.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.410
Everything's going to be all right.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.209
How can it be?

01:04.260 --> 01:05.770
It will, I promise.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.570
I killed the Oracle.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.980
I am cursed for ever.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.700
The execution is set for the
full moon... as the law decrees.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.170
What news?

01:37.220 --> 01:39.290
None of comfort, I'm afraid.

01:39.340 --> 01:42.460
They are preparing the bronze bull.

01:43.850 --> 01:44.850
The bull?

01:44.900 --> 01:47.410
The bull is only for traitors,

01:47.460 --> 01:50.410
for those who betrayed Atlantis.

01:50.460 --> 01:53.570
Melas says, by blaspheming the
gods, you did betray the city.

01:53.620 --> 01:57.130
~ Has a date been set?
~ The night of the full moon.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.050
In two days' time.

02:00.940 --> 02:02.730
I'm so sorry.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.930
Ariadne won't let this happen.

02:04.980 --> 02:06.370
She can't.

02:06.420 --> 02:09.900
She'll reverse the judgment.
I know she will.

02:16.940 --> 02:20.540
Where is she? You gave me
your word I could see her.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.290
~ Have they hurt you?
~ When can I come home?

02:31.340 --> 02:33.700
Soon. Very soon.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.730
I'm doing all I can, I promise.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.450
~ Enough.
~ I need to...

02:38.500 --> 02:41.250
~ Take her away.
~ No, no, no.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.610
Please...

02:42.660 --> 02:44.650
Please don't leave me!
Please don't leave me!

02:44.700 --> 02:46.940
I must...

02:49.100 --> 02:51.570
You're sure he'll remain loyal?

02:51.620 --> 02:53.490
She is like a daughter to him.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.210
More than a daughter - the
future Oracle of Atlantis.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.810
~ Poseidon's voice on Earth.
~ From the day she was chosen,

02:58.860 --> 03:01.570
Melas took a solemn oath to
protect her above all else,

03:01.620 --> 03:03.530
even with his own life.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.530
You need not fear.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.680
As long as we have
Cassandra, we have Melas.

03:12.820 --> 03:14.850
You assured me the Oracle
would not be harmed.

03:14.900 --> 03:18.900
You chose to believe that to
make it easier to betray her.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.570
The date for the execution
has been set?

03:22.620 --> 03:24.090
For the day after tomorrow.

03:24.140 --> 03:26.290
The sooner it is done, the better.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.620
~ And yet it is such a cruel death.
~ We have no choice.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.530
It is as Poseidon decreed.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.850
He may also grant clemency.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.490
After all, what threat is the boy?

03:36.540 --> 03:38.810
None yet, but in time he may be.

03:38.860 --> 03:42.250
It is a terrible thing to witness
the death of your own child,

03:42.300 --> 03:43.450
let alone sanction it.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.330
Are you suggesting I turn
a blind eye to blasphemy

03:46.380 --> 03:49.320
because it was committed
by my own son?

03:53.940 --> 03:56.170
And what of Ariadne?
Will she interfere?

03:56.220 --> 03:59.410
She seems to have accepted
the judgment of the gods.

03:59.460 --> 04:02.850
~ She makes no special plea for Jason?
~ I have not heard her do so.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.410
Hm.

04:04.460 --> 04:07.560
She is learning what
it means to be a queen.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.700
Perhaps I underestimated her.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.890
Cassandra?

04:15.060 --> 04:17.600
You promised she would be freed.

04:20.180 --> 04:24.580
And she will be, the moment
I am on the throne.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.980
~ Pythagoras?
~ I couldn't sleep.

04:47.180 --> 04:50.490
~ Where have you been?
~ I went for a walk.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.130
At this time of night?

04:52.180 --> 04:54.170
I thought it might help. It didn't.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.490
We should get some sleep.
We see the Queen tomorrow.

04:56.540 --> 04:59.100
She granted us an audience?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.040
Thank the gods.

05:03.060 --> 05:06.900
Lipareo de tukhein eleon
su kai s'iketeuo.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.210
Your Highness.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.380
I came to pray for Jason.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.400
And to beg for clemency.

05:23.980 --> 05:26.410
Only the gods may grant pardon.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.060
We have spent many hours together.

05:30.180 --> 05:34.220
I know you to be a good man, a loyal
servant to me and to Poseidon.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.170
And yet you condemn an innocent man.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.970
Jason could no more kill
the Oracle than I.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.810
The gods have spoken. Who
am I, or you, to doubt them?

05:43.860 --> 05:46.930
You would swear, on the golden
bull, that Jason is guilty?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.610
A priest has no need to swear.

05:48.660 --> 05:51.370
His whole life is dedicated
to serving the gods.

05:51.420 --> 05:52.730
It's not too late.

05:52.780 --> 05:56.900
You could petition the council,
overturn the sentence.

06:01.780 --> 06:03.620
Goodnight, then.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.010
Your Highness...

06:09.060 --> 06:12.050
You think I am your enemy. I am not.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.610
No mortal has the right
to challenge the gods -

06:14.660 --> 06:16.860
neither priest nor queen.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.690
To do so would bring the wrath
of Poseidon upon us all.

06:20.740 --> 06:23.940
Please... remember that.

06:29.580 --> 06:33.140
As Poseidon's servant, we know
your power is without limit.

06:34.620 --> 06:38.210
We come to plead for our friend Jason.
We ask that he may be freed.

06:38.260 --> 06:39.890
On what grounds do
you make this plea?

06:39.940 --> 06:41.890
He's not guilty of any
crime, Your Highness.

06:41.940 --> 06:44.970
Jason has been condemned
by the gods themselves

06:45.020 --> 06:47.770
for murdering Poseidon's
most sacred servant.

06:47.820 --> 06:49.770
We do not believe that to
be the case, Your Highness.

06:49.820 --> 06:51.490
Then who committed the act?

06:51.540 --> 06:54.730
For the Oracle is dead,
that much is certain.

06:54.780 --> 06:58.740
~ The Gorgon Medusa killed her.
~ And where is this Gorgon?

06:59.940 --> 07:03.100
~ We don't know.
~ Without her testimony,
how are we to believe you?

07:04.460 --> 07:07.330
We have served you well.
We would not lie to you.

07:07.380 --> 07:10.490
You wish to save your friend,
and that is commendable.

07:10.540 --> 07:14.140
But Jason has been found
guilty by Poseidon himself.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.010
How can I contradict the gods?

07:16.060 --> 07:17.370
He is not guilty!

07:17.420 --> 07:18.650
Take care, Hercules.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.740
To challenge the word of the
gods is to blaspheme them.

07:22.780 --> 07:26.540
Perhaps Your Highness could petition
Poseidon to show clemency...

07:35.860 --> 07:38.490
There can be no clemency,
only justice.

07:38.540 --> 07:39.890
Your Highness!

07:39.940 --> 07:42.970
The sentence must and
shall be carried out...

07:43.020 --> 07:45.620
according to the will of the gods.

07:46.140 --> 07:47.610
I'm sorry.

07:59.380 --> 08:02.580
No clemency, only justice?
Those were her very words?

08:05.020 --> 08:07.090
Was it all lies, then?

08:09.820 --> 08:11.490
Did she never care for me at all?

08:11.540 --> 08:12.850
I'm sure she did.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.970
If I am to die, then I need to know
her feelings for me were true.

08:16.020 --> 08:19.320
You must ask for an audience.
See her in person.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.660
You are right. I'll look
into her eyes and I'll know.

08:24.820 --> 08:26.420
We both will.

08:33.340 --> 08:36.049
Ariadne is in a difficult
position, I can see that,

08:36.100 --> 08:40.220
but I still cannot believe how
she would turn her back on Jason.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.330
Hercules?

08:43.380 --> 08:44.810
~ Hercules!
~ What?!

08:44.860 --> 08:48.580
Your friend is about to be executed.
Do you have nothing to say?

08:49.780 --> 08:51.050
I saw her.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.690
What?

08:52.740 --> 08:54.340
I saw Medusa.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.450
Where is she?

08:56.500 --> 08:58.410
~ I can't tell you.
~ You must!

08:58.460 --> 08:59.930
We have to fetch her at once.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.170
~ No.
~ No?

09:02.220 --> 09:05.170
I won't lose her again. I won't
bring her back to be executed.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.180
You have no choice.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.400
You'd have me hand
Medusa over to Melas?

09:11.820 --> 09:14.370
Have her put in the brazen
bull and be burnt to death?

09:14.420 --> 09:17.610
~ I cannot do that.
~ It's either her or Jason.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.930
She has suffered so much already.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.220
The gods can be cruel.

09:25.300 --> 09:29.260
~ There must be another way.
~ If there was, we would have found it.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.930
Would you like me to go to her?

09:35.980 --> 09:37.210
No.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.800
If it's anyone, it should be me.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.140
Medusa?

10:19.860 --> 10:21.690
Medusa?

10:21.740 --> 10:23.620
It's me, Hercules.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.690
Are you all right?

10:28.740 --> 10:30.740
Yes. Yes, I think so.

10:32.420 --> 10:35.130
I have done a terrible thing,
Hercules. I know that.

10:35.180 --> 10:37.010
But I will earn your love again.

10:37.060 --> 10:39.580
~ I will.
~ You already have that.

10:41.180 --> 10:42.810
You always have.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.800
I don't deserve it.

10:46.340 --> 10:49.780
You deserve so much more
than I can ever give you.

10:55.220 --> 10:58.220
I am the luckiest woman in the
world to have found you, Hercules.

11:03.380 --> 11:04.920
What is it?

11:06.340 --> 11:09.940
~ It's nothing.
~ I know you too well to believe that.

11:11.140 --> 11:14.290
It's just nice to see
you feeling better.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.450
After all that I have done,

11:16.500 --> 11:20.290
I never thought the gods would
smile on me again, and yet...

11:20.340 --> 11:25.180
You have no idea how wonderful it is
to be able to look at you once more.

11:42.420 --> 11:44.530
~ You asked to see me.
~ Thank you for coming.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.970
I wish to have an audience
with the Queen.

11:47.020 --> 11:49.370
She was present when Melas
delivered his verdict.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.740
But after everything that we
have been through together...

11:54.860 --> 11:57.200
.. I think she owes me this.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.170
I'll see what I can do.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.730
Ennosigaie pater,

12:09.780 --> 12:12.180
timei se latreuomen hemeis.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.250
Great Poseidon...

12:27.300 --> 12:29.730
accept these, our libations.

12:29.780 --> 12:34.170
May the bull burn away the evil

12:34.220 --> 12:36.370
that has been done...

12:36.420 --> 12:39.160
and free your people from its curse.

12:52.460 --> 12:54.450
~ Your Highness.
~ Cilix.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.570
I just wanted to say, you've
done the right thing.

12:56.620 --> 12:59.170
If you had granted Jason a reprieve,

12:59.220 --> 13:01.770
Poseidon would have wreaked
terrible revenge on the city.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.050
No doubt.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.690
I know how difficult it must have
been for you, how impossible.

13:06.740 --> 13:09.610
Jason has served you
well in the past.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.500
The thought of him dying like that...

13:16.620 --> 13:18.570
But it is the will of the gods.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.450
I cannot put the fate of one man

13:20.500 --> 13:23.240
before the future of all of Atlantis.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.380
What must be must be.

13:36.860 --> 13:38.260
Hercules?

13:41.420 --> 13:43.690
I didn't want to wake you.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.410
You looked so... perfect.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.400
What are you doing?

13:51.020 --> 13:52.850
I have to return to Atlantis.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.570
There's something I must attend to.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.530
What do they say about me?

13:58.580 --> 14:00.570
~ How do you mean?
~ Do they blame me

14:00.620 --> 14:02.770
~ for the Oracle's death?
~ Of course not!

14:02.820 --> 14:05.560
They blame Pasiphae, as they should.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.420
When will you return?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.920
As soon as I can, I promise.

14:27.180 --> 14:29.210
Goodbye, Medusa.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.260
Goodbye.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.650
Well?

14:42.700 --> 14:45.820
Has the Queen agreed?
Will she see me?

14:46.900 --> 14:48.370
I'm sorry.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.970
But you told her? You told
her I asked for an audience?

14:52.020 --> 14:54.460
What did she say?

14:55.460 --> 14:57.490
~ Please!
~ She refused your request.

14:57.540 --> 15:00.130
Her Highness bows to
the will of the gods.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.780
That's all?

15:04.580 --> 15:06.050
I'm sorry.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.620
Truly.

15:19.660 --> 15:20.690
Yes?

15:20.740 --> 15:22.090
Nothing.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.140
Then why are you looking
at me like that?

15:25.980 --> 15:27.730
~ Like what?
~ Like that!

15:27.780 --> 15:30.180
I wasn't looking at anything.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.410
Oi!

15:34.460 --> 15:35.600
Oi!

15:38.420 --> 15:39.930
What is wrong with this place?!

15:39.980 --> 15:41.770
Maybe they think you've had enough.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.620
What did you say?

15:44.660 --> 15:45.850
Nothing.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.570
You're the one who cheated me.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.610
No.

15:48.660 --> 15:49.650
At dice.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.690
You cheated me. Give me my
money back, you little rat!

15:52.740 --> 15:54.090
You said you forgave me.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.130
That was only if you didn't survive.

15:56.180 --> 15:59.010
~ Hercules! Hercules!
~ You stay out of this!

15:59.060 --> 16:02.130
~ We don't want any trouble.
~ Enough!

16:02.180 --> 16:04.050
He stole my money!

16:04.100 --> 16:06.770
I don't care if he stole your wife.

16:07.260 --> 16:08.930
Take him to the cells.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.850
Thank you. Thank you so much.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.300
And him.

16:22.980 --> 16:26.210
A jug? We never agreed on a jug!

16:26.260 --> 16:28.250
It was all I could find!
Does it hurt much?

16:28.300 --> 16:31.240
I've had worse. Have
you got the pitch?

16:32.540 --> 16:34.650
Right.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.370
Are you ready?

16:37.820 --> 16:40.090
Help! Help, he's going to kill me!

16:40.140 --> 16:42.250
Help! Get him off me!

16:42.300 --> 16:44.900
What's going on here?

16:46.300 --> 16:49.810
~ What have you done to him?
~ He threw himself into the bars.

16:49.860 --> 16:51.530
If you've...

16:51.580 --> 16:54.500
I haven't. See how you like it.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.290
I'll come with you.

17:03.340 --> 17:06.450
No, Critias, you've
done enough already.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.810
More than enough.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.660
~ There's no way you're going to go...
~ It'll be easier on my own. But thank you.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.880
I won't forget this.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.490
Jason!

17:44.540 --> 17:46.290
Come on. This way.

17:46.340 --> 17:47.970
Are you mad?

17:48.020 --> 17:50.730
Trust me. Hold this
against your mouth.

17:50.780 --> 17:54.180
~ Wait, where's Pythagoras?
~ Cooking supper, I hope.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.130
The kitchen storerooms are
that way. We can cut through.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.970
~ How do you know that?
~ Medusa used to work here, remember?

18:14.020 --> 18:17.520
No-one ever goes down there
at this time of night.

18:23.780 --> 18:26.120
Maybe not absolutely no-one.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.730
I came as soon as I could.

18:58.780 --> 19:02.570
I know you have been of service
to the Queen in the past,

19:02.620 --> 19:05.330
which is why I wanted
to tell you in person.

19:05.380 --> 19:08.410
Hercules attempted to free
Jason. He's been arrested.

19:08.460 --> 19:11.330
I feared he would do
something foolish.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.890
He faces grave charges.

19:12.940 --> 19:16.090
He is to be executed in the
bronze bull, along with Jason.

19:16.140 --> 19:18.540
Jason has committed no crime.

19:19.140 --> 19:22.410
And if Hercules is guilty, it is
only of loving his friend too much.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.170
~ Nevertheless...
~ Well, can the Queen not intervene?

19:25.220 --> 19:27.570
~ Ariadne can do nothing.
~ She could have them imprisoned,

19:27.620 --> 19:31.130
exiled, anything but
the cruellest of deaths.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.970
The people would never allow it.

19:33.020 --> 19:36.220
The people are frightened
of Poseidon's anger.

19:36.660 --> 19:38.060
And you?

19:39.100 --> 19:41.090
I am but a servant.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.610
So there is no hope?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.660
The gods have spoken.

19:48.940 --> 19:50.370
Can I at least say goodbye?

19:50.420 --> 19:51.850
Tonight, Jason and Hercules

19:51.900 --> 19:55.530
are to be purified. Tonight,
they belong to Poseidon.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.520
They can see no-one.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.290
I'm sorry.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.810
Hercules acted out of loyalty.

20:20.860 --> 20:24.060
All he's done is make
things worse for us all.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.940
It's my fault, all of it.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.290
You did everything you could.

20:35.340 --> 20:38.210
There's so much I should have
done, so much I shouldn't.

20:38.260 --> 20:40.010
It doesn't matter now.

20:40.060 --> 20:44.010
I should have told you about Medusa.
I should have told you that she...

20:44.060 --> 20:45.600
Hercules...

20:47.020 --> 20:48.960
It's not important.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.970
But you've been a good
and loyal friend to me.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.160
That's all that matters.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.530
It is time.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.650
You must...

21:02.700 --> 21:04.300
be prepared.

21:31.260 --> 21:33.530
You must make your peace...

21:34.740 --> 21:36.540
.. with Poseidon.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.290
O megal' Ennosigai'...

22:33.340 --> 22:35.850
ei gar tade

22:35.900 --> 22:39.060
thumat' areskoi.

24:07.820 --> 24:11.050
Put these on. You know the north
parapet, above the kitchen?

24:11.100 --> 24:14.730
Take the side stairs. I'll
have someone meet you there.

24:14.780 --> 24:16.500
Hurry!

24:17.660 --> 24:20.600
I cannot leave this
unreported for long.

24:21.970 --> 24:22.970
Why?

24:23.020 --> 24:26.450
Because sometimes even the
gods need a little help.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.840
Now go.

24:45.380 --> 24:48.180
~ There's no-one here.
~ There has to be.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.300
You must be quick.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.850
Pythagoras!

25:19.900 --> 25:22.370
~ No time to explain.
~ I'm sorry, but what the hell is going on?

25:22.420 --> 25:25.860
~ Hercules, for once in your life,
will you just do as you're told?
~ Pythagoras!

25:29.620 --> 25:31.610
Go!

25:31.660 --> 25:33.090
You!

25:33.140 --> 25:36.340
Now! Go! Meet me at the
sacred grove of Artemis.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.610
Show yourself!

25:39.660 --> 25:40.730
Me?

25:40.780 --> 25:44.020
Do... not... move!

25:45.180 --> 25:48.530
Absolutely. Not a
problem. Not moving.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.860
Not moving.

27:06.980 --> 27:08.450
What news?

27:11.140 --> 27:13.690
They're safely out of the city.

27:13.740 --> 27:16.930
~ Thank the gods!
~ I have Nestor and his
men searching the streets.

27:16.980 --> 27:19.810
It's important we're seen to
be doing everything we can.

27:19.860 --> 27:23.160
The people must have no
idea you were involved.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.490
I don't know how to thank you.

27:26.540 --> 27:29.500
Loyalty needs no thanks,
Your Highness.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.800
But we must be careful.
It's not over yet.

27:39.740 --> 27:42.090
We shouldn't have left him.

27:42.140 --> 27:43.810
He knew what he was doing.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.250
You think?

27:45.300 --> 27:47.810
He's a clever man, Hercules.
He's the cleverest.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.290
I hope you're right.

27:49.340 --> 27:50.570
Of course I am.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.970
Besides, he has Ariadne to help him.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.570
You can't be sure.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.290
She helped us. She'll help him.

27:56.340 --> 27:59.170
We have no proof she
was behind our escape.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.220
Well, then, who else?

28:01.980 --> 28:05.530
She was never going to
let me die. Don't you see?

28:05.580 --> 28:07.490
I was a fool to ever
have doubted her.

28:07.540 --> 28:10.780
If you're right, she's
playing a dangerous game.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.930
Instruct the council
to issue a decree.

28:13.980 --> 28:16.450
It is the duty of every citizen
to apprehend the fugitives.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.450
To help them in any way
is punishable by death.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.010
The Queen has already done
so. She learns quickly.

28:21.060 --> 28:23.330
Jason is free, yet the
people do not blame her.

28:23.380 --> 28:25.290
Then they need to be enlightened.

28:25.340 --> 28:28.250
They need to be told the Queen is behind
these crimes towards the gods.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.050
~ That will not be easy.
~ You are a councillor. Use your influence.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.090
I am but one among many,
and the many remain loyal.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.880
There is no loyalty to a blasphemer.

28:37.860 --> 28:40.530
They must be made to see the truth.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.370
Jason's escape threatens everything.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.410
Not necessarily.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.610
He will not be content to
remain outside Atlantis.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.730
~ While he lives, you are vulnerable.
~ On the contrary.

28:51.780 --> 28:54.320
He has made me all the stronger.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.160
Jason is Ariadne's weakness.

28:57.980 --> 28:59.930
She will fall because of him.

28:59.980 --> 29:02.650
~ How can you be sure?
~ You will see.

29:11.580 --> 29:14.380
~ You wished to see me?
~ I did.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.980
Thank you.

29:18.260 --> 29:19.930
Shall we walk?

29:22.260 --> 29:24.140
Jason's escape...

29:25.300 --> 29:27.570
It is causing much unrest.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.130
The people...

29:30.180 --> 29:32.010
fear Poseidon is angry.

29:32.060 --> 29:33.850
They are afraid.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.130
They may have good cause.

29:36.180 --> 29:39.090
They need a sign. They
need to know for sure.

29:39.140 --> 29:42.820
You want me to seek
answers from the gods?

29:44.020 --> 29:47.260
If the omens are bad,
the unrest will grow.

29:48.260 --> 29:49.890
The people will be in no doubt

29:49.940 --> 29:55.610
that Poseidon will take revenge upon
Atlantis unless Jason is found.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.850
And if the omens are not bad?

29:57.900 --> 29:59.700
They will be bad.

30:01.180 --> 30:03.520
You will make sure they are.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.650
Hercules, wake up.

30:10.700 --> 30:14.530
~ Wake up!
~ Hm? Where? What's going on?
~ Sh. Did you hear that?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.490
Was I snoring? There's a funny thing.

30:16.540 --> 30:19.530
~ You'd think you'd be able
to hear yourself snoring...
~ Not that.

30:19.580 --> 30:21.460
That!

30:31.460 --> 30:33.850
~ What are they doing?
~ What do you think they're doing?

30:33.900 --> 30:35.690
I thought Delmos was on our side.

30:35.740 --> 30:38.410
~ Why's he sending his men to search for us?
~ I don't know.

30:38.460 --> 30:41.410
Maybe he has to, to
convince the people.

30:41.460 --> 30:45.650
Or maybe they caught Pythagoras
and he told them where we are.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.770
~ He would never do that.
~ But what if he did?

30:47.820 --> 30:50.050
~ We should leave.
~ No. He told us to wait.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.970
~ That was before he told
everyone where we are.
~ Pythagoras wouldn't say anything to anyone.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.410
~ Then why isn't he here?
~ Well, he probably thinks

30:56.460 --> 30:58.650
it's too dangerous and that
he'd lead them straight to us.

30:58.700 --> 31:01.970
~ What if that's exactly what he is doing?
~ Hercules, if you want to go,

31:02.020 --> 31:03.490
go.

31:03.540 --> 31:05.010
I'm staying.

31:05.060 --> 31:07.010
All right.

31:07.060 --> 31:10.540
~ But if they come one step closer, I'm off.
~ Fine.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.240
And so are you.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.210
.. historeo tod' alethes.

31:18.260 --> 31:21.010
Ennosigai', epi su nun...

31:21.060 --> 31:23.460
historeo tod' alethes.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.290
The gods have spoken.

31:38.340 --> 31:43.130
The path to the right of
the left lobe is black.

31:43.180 --> 31:45.450
How do you interpret this?

31:47.740 --> 31:49.450
The gods' will has been defied,

31:49.500 --> 31:51.410
their judgment insulted.

31:51.460 --> 31:53.970
I move that the council be
called before it is too late.

31:54.020 --> 31:56.960
We must find a way
to appease the gods.

32:07.540 --> 32:10.130
I once held Melas
in the utmost trust.

32:10.180 --> 32:12.330
Now he's little more
than Cilix's slave,

32:12.380 --> 32:15.450
to jump in joy at every snap
of his master's fingers.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.450
~ The council will require answers.
~ And we shall provide them.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.290
Cilix may be cunning,
but he's also a coward.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.690
You are still their Queen. The council
will hardly doubt your word.

32:24.740 --> 32:27.170
I hope, for all our
sakes, you're right.

32:27.220 --> 32:31.530
Before Poseidon, I ask the council
to consider a most grave matter.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.730
The blasphemers, Jason and Hercules,

32:33.780 --> 32:35.930
have defied the judgment of the gods,

32:35.980 --> 32:38.090
absconded from justice

32:38.140 --> 32:40.770
and insulted the memory
of the holy Oracle.

32:40.820 --> 32:43.290
All is being done to find them.

32:43.340 --> 32:45.690
This very day, the
omens have been read,

32:45.740 --> 32:47.940
and they are quite clear.

32:48.620 --> 32:50.010
Poseidon is angry,

32:50.060 --> 32:53.260
angry with us for allowing
the blasphemers to escape.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.810
He will be avenged on the
murder of his Oracle,

32:56.860 --> 32:58.930
and when his ire strikes,

32:58.980 --> 33:03.010
it will destroy us all,
guilty and innocent alike.

33:03.060 --> 33:06.570
~ Is this not what the omens say, Melas?
~ It is.

33:06.620 --> 33:09.610
Every soldier in Atlantis is
looking for the prisoners.

33:09.660 --> 33:11.170
They will be found.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.690
But, Your Highness, someone
must pay for this crime.

33:14.740 --> 33:17.940
That is our only hope. The
only hope for the city.

33:19.900 --> 33:23.330
There are some, Your Highness,

33:23.380 --> 33:26.380
who say that you knew
about Jason's escape.

33:27.420 --> 33:28.610
Even abetted it.

33:28.660 --> 33:31.890
~ Does the council now listen to rumour?
~ It listens to the people.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.010
And the people are fearful,
Your Highness.

33:34.060 --> 33:36.970
Fearful their own Queen
may have angered Poseidon.

33:37.020 --> 33:38.690
Well...

33:38.740 --> 33:42.930
.. is there any truth in these
malicious rumours, any at all?

33:42.980 --> 33:44.930
I know only what everyone knows.

33:44.980 --> 33:47.570
That the prisoners were condemned
and sentence was passed.

33:47.620 --> 33:50.570
And as a servant of Poseidon, we
must, of course, accept your word.

33:50.620 --> 33:53.020
It is the word of your Queen.

33:56.740 --> 33:58.210
You would have no problem, then,

33:58.260 --> 34:00.290
repeating your oath
on the golden bull,

34:00.340 --> 34:02.940
just to allay any remaining doubt?

34:08.340 --> 34:10.010
Your Highness?

34:21.020 --> 34:22.820
I will not swear.

34:23.900 --> 34:26.330
Jason is innocent. He
does not deserve to die.

34:26.380 --> 34:30.020
You challenge the judgment of
the gods, of Poseidon himself?

34:31.020 --> 34:33.610
~ I refuse to sanction an injustice.
~ Then I fear

34:33.659 --> 34:34.969
you leave the council no choice.

34:35.020 --> 34:37.820
You must be placed under arrest.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.000
You have blasphemed.

34:41.699 --> 34:43.570
~ Seize her.
~ Stand down!

34:43.620 --> 34:46.570
You have no authority
to issue such an order.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.290
The council cannot pass
judgment on a queen.

34:49.340 --> 34:52.370
It is not the council that
accuses her. Melas...

34:52.420 --> 34:55.170
You have defied the will of the gods.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.370
Such hubris...

34:57.420 --> 34:59.420
cannot go unpunished.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.330
Take her to the cells.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.450
Pythagoras?

35:24.500 --> 35:25.810
Who's asking?

35:25.860 --> 35:26.890
Delmos sent me.

35:26.940 --> 35:31.300
Look, please. You must get word to
Jason. The Queen has been arrested.

36:17.900 --> 36:22.490
He can't do that. Cilix
cannot arrest the Queen!

36:22.540 --> 36:23.770
It seems he has.

36:23.820 --> 36:26.010
Well, do we know where
they're holding her?

36:26.060 --> 36:30.060
~ Is she alone? Does she have anyone with her?
~ I don't know.

36:30.140 --> 36:32.530
~ I must go back.
~ Why would you do that?

36:32.580 --> 36:34.650
How can I stay here and let
Ariadne take the blame?

36:34.700 --> 36:39.420
~ You'd be lynched before you got through
the city gates. What good would that do?
~ I can't do nothing!

36:42.340 --> 36:44.410
There is one person...

36:45.380 --> 36:47.920
.. who can save Ariadne and you.

36:51.380 --> 36:54.880
~ Medusa.
~ I'm sorry, Hercules, but we must go to her.

36:56.220 --> 36:58.090
There's no choice.

37:08.340 --> 37:10.170
Delmos?

37:10.220 --> 37:11.770
I'm so sorry.

37:11.820 --> 37:14.920
This is all my doing.
If it wasn't for me...

37:15.540 --> 37:19.010
Loyalty doesn't question the cost...

37:19.060 --> 37:20.730
Your Highness.

37:28.020 --> 37:29.890
Is this the place?

37:31.500 --> 37:32.850
Hercules, if you'd rather I...

37:32.900 --> 37:34.090
No.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.940
It should be me.

37:37.820 --> 37:38.970
I...

37:39.020 --> 37:41.290
I'd rather... do it alone.

37:42.940 --> 37:44.880
I give you my word.

37:50.420 --> 37:52.570
Where did they arrest you?

37:52.620 --> 37:53.930
In my chambers.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.050
But your men...

37:55.100 --> 37:59.370
The army is no longer loyal, Your
Highness, either to me or you.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.730
Who ordered your arrest?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.050
I believe it was Cilix.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.500
Your men would never obey him.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.140
Yet it seems they did.

38:14.220 --> 38:17.780
~ Please, say something.
~ There is nothing to say.

38:19.260 --> 38:21.530
I must return to Atlantis.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.490
I would give my life to stop this.

38:25.540 --> 38:27.370
I know.

38:27.420 --> 38:29.220
I know you would.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.900
And my only regret is leaving you.

38:35.020 --> 38:37.210
How can the gods let this happen?

38:37.260 --> 38:39.530
I did what I did, Hercules.

38:40.740 --> 38:44.540
Ever since I opened that box,
my fate has been sealed.

38:45.420 --> 38:46.770
I...

38:46.820 --> 38:51.250
thought I could live
with it, outrun my past.

38:51.300 --> 38:52.900
But I cannot.

38:53.780 --> 38:55.780
I must pay the price.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.100
Medusa...

39:09.020 --> 39:10.810
It's time.

39:10.860 --> 39:12.660
We must be brave.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.440
Both of us.

39:36.100 --> 39:40.570
~ Medusa...
~ It's all right, you don't
have to say anything.

39:40.620 --> 39:45.330
I want you to know my life only
made sense when I met you.

39:45.380 --> 39:48.420
I know, because it
was the same for me.

40:02.580 --> 40:05.210
It is the right thing
to do, Hercules.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.930
Doesn't make it any easier to bear.

40:18.380 --> 40:20.130
Why's no-one here?

40:20.180 --> 40:22.050
Something's wrong.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.640
There's another way.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.220
All hail!

41:40.020 --> 41:44.490
I think I know a way to get
Ariadne out of the city.

41:44.540 --> 41:46.540
You have to trust me.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.770
The fate of Atlantis is at stake.

41:49.820 --> 41:52.490
There is something I must retrieve.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.460
Hercules!
