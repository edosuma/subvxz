WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.744
All right, people,
this test is called

00:05.831 --> 00:07.964
the "Standardized City-Wide
Academic Review."

00:08.051 --> 00:11.315
Which the Chicago
Board of Education,

00:11.402 --> 00:13.013
in its infinite wisdom,

00:13.100 --> 00:16.016
has dubbed "The SCAR."

00:16.103 --> 00:17.408
Not to put too much
pressure on you,

00:17.495 --> 00:19.889
but this is
the first exam of many

00:19.976 --> 00:23.371
that will determine...

00:23.458 --> 00:26.026
well, whether you win
or lose at life.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.854
I mean, not that acing it

00:28.941 --> 00:31.466
is any guarantee, because...

00:31.553 --> 00:33.033
well, you know, I...

00:33.120 --> 00:33.903
I crushed this thing
when I was your age.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.861
I crushed it.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.994
But I pretty
much crushed

00:38.081 --> 00:39.343
whatever they put
in front of me:

00:39.430 --> 00:40.649
A.C.T.s,

00:40.736 --> 00:41.867
S.A.T.s,

00:41.954 --> 00:43.739
G.R.E.s.

00:43.826 --> 00:46.002
Not sure what I have
to show for it.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.570
Maybe S.Q.U.A.T.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.093
Squat.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.401
I mean, I still drive
a beat up old car

00:53.488 --> 00:55.055
and live in my mom's basement,

00:55.142 --> 00:57.187
and I'm suffocating
under a mountain of debt.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.971
Sometimes, there are mornings

00:59.059 --> 01:01.974
I wake up and I just think,

01:02.062 --> 01:04.977
"Why are you even gonna
get out of bed?"

01:05.239 --> 01:07.763
The bed which
I'm still making payments on,

01:07.850 --> 01:09.373
by the way.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.462
Okay...

01:11.549 --> 01:13.899
Let's, uh, pick up our pencils.

01:13.986 --> 01:18.121
You have one hour
to complete this test...

01:18.208 --> 01:20.167
[timer ticking]

01:20.254 --> 01:22.212
...and begin.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.650
[exhales]

01:25.737 --> 01:26.608
You know what?
I'm just gonna

01:26.695 --> 01:30.002
stop you for one second.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.744
Um, do you ever just kind of

01:32.831 --> 01:35.225
stand back and look at your life

01:35.312 --> 01:37.053
and think, "This is not
where I ought to be"?

01:37.140 --> 01:40.274
You know?
Or...

01:40.361 --> 01:43.320
just think, "Do I have
the courage to change?

01:43.407 --> 01:45.366
"Or am I gonna just keep

01:45.453 --> 01:48.108
"doing this over and over

01:48.195 --> 01:50.153
and over again until you die?"

01:50.240 --> 01:51.589
You know, or you die,

01:51.676 --> 01:53.374
or you're...
you're gonna die, too.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.506
We're all gonna die.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.160
'Cause you'll...
you guys only have
fourth grade once.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.380
I have...

01:59.467 --> 02:00.381
I have all this

02:00.468 --> 02:03.340
for 30 more years.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.168
Okay.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.736
Listen up,
'cause this might be

02:07.823 --> 02:09.390
the best lesson
I ever teach you.

02:15.657 --> 02:16.571
Okay, don't settle!

02:16.658 --> 02:18.921
Follow your dreams...

02:19.008 --> 02:21.967
wherever they may take you!

02:26.146 --> 02:29.497
Kids... can somebody
please hand me my purse?

02:29.584 --> 02:31.542
And my bag.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.375
MIKE:
Molly!

02:38.462 --> 02:40.812
Mol, what the hell
are you doing?

02:40.899 --> 02:43.250
I'm following my dream!

02:43.337 --> 02:45.339
The school called
and said you just
kind of left.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.340
Had to.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.819
My dream's
thataway!

02:47.906 --> 02:49.517
Well, okay.
Get in the car

02:49.604 --> 02:50.953
and let us take
you thataway.
No, thanks.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.128
Having kind of
a baptism thing here.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.741
Stop the car.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.700
Aw...

02:58.787 --> 03:00.049
There's a big puddle here.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.181
Back up.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.061
Seriously?

03:12.148 --> 03:15.543
Well, at least
you didn't get
your feet wet, Princess.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.201
♪ La, la-dee-dee-da ♪

03:21.288 --> 03:24.116
♪ La,
la-dee-dee-da ♪

03:24.204 --> 03:27.598
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

03:27.685 --> 03:31.254
♪ I see love ♪♪ I see love♪

03:31.341 --> 03:34.083
♪ For the first time

03:34.170 --> 03:37.652
♪ I see love ♪♪ I see love.♪

03:45.442 --> 03:46.748
Oh, how's she doing?

03:46.835 --> 03:48.619
She's worn out,
the poor thing.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.012
Yeah, I feel
for her.

03:50.099 --> 03:52.797
I am not paying for that door.

03:52.884 --> 03:55.017
That's not my priority
right now, Carl.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.018
But for the record,
I said, "Back up,"

03:56.105 --> 03:58.455
not, "Hit the hydrant."

03:59.804 --> 04:01.458
This is just so weird.

04:01.545 --> 04:04.156
I have never seen Molly
act like this.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.071
Mom, maybe you
should tell him.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.072
Tell me what?

04:07.159 --> 04:08.335
Nothing.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.510
We shouldn't jump
to conclusions.

04:09.597 --> 04:10.815
Joyce,
what's going on?

04:10.902 --> 04:13.905
Ah, boy... I don't
know how to say it.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.603
Well, just say it.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.781
There's a history of mental
illness in our family.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.835
Wow.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.186
Nothing
real bad.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.711
Just barking,
eating your own hair...

04:36.798 --> 04:40.018
...holding an imaginary baby.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.848
Wow.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.981
Well, hang on, now.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.070
Let's-let's not go
to crazy so fast.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.767
I mean, all she did

04:49.854 --> 04:51.813
was flip out in front of
a bunch of nine-year-olds,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.249
climb out a window

04:53.336 --> 04:54.990
and walk six miles in the rain.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.426
Wow.

05:05.261 --> 05:05.870
Mol?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.872
Yeah?

05:07.959 --> 05:09.700
You okay?

05:09.787 --> 05:12.050
Been better.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.444
I made you some soup.

05:14.531 --> 05:15.793
Is it turkey noodle?

05:15.880 --> 05:18.883
Yeah, but you gotta come out

05:18.970 --> 05:20.842
if you're gonna eat it.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.932
There she is.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.718
There you go, honey.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.938
Thanks.

05:30.025 --> 05:30.808
Sorry about
your car door.

05:30.895 --> 05:31.853
Oh, it's all right.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.768
It's not
the first time.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.205
So, uh...

05:36.292 --> 05:38.686
you want to tell me
what happened today?

05:38.773 --> 05:40.078
[sighs]

05:40.165 --> 05:41.079
I'm not sure.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.254
You know?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.344
I just...
started feeling

05:44.431 --> 05:47.434
overwhelmed by
everything and...

05:47.521 --> 05:48.696
I don't know,
leaving just seemed

05:48.783 --> 05:50.567
like the right
thing to do.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.003
Through the window?

05:53.831 --> 05:56.312
You know, anybody can
leave through a door.

05:56.399 --> 05:56.965
[sighs]

05:57.052 --> 06:00.447
True.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.926
Uh, the-the school called.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.972
They're a little curious
about your intentions.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.279
I get that.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.760
I'm a little
curious, too.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.066
Well...

06:11.153 --> 06:13.198
whatever you need,

06:13.285 --> 06:16.376
just know...
I'm here for you.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.597
[choked up]:
Thanks for being
so understanding.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.817
Hey, you're my wife.

06:22.904 --> 06:23.905
I love you.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.516
Thanks.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.264
[sniffs]

06:35.351 --> 06:37.353
[sighs]

06:39.355 --> 06:42.097
Hang on,
let me just...

06:42.184 --> 06:43.315
There you go.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.538
Oh, I hope that's
soup I'm tasting.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.757
I haven't
had any yet.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.802
Yeah.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.287
Don't worry.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.289
I've been a union
rep for years.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.812
I've gotten
teachers off

07:01.899 --> 07:02.944
for doing a whole lot
worse than you did.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.337
Really?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.600
Oh, yeah.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.298
Horrible,
horrible things.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.866
Keep you up
at night.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.998
And they're still
teaching the little ones.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.785
To be honest,

07:17.872 --> 07:19.090
I-I don't have a very good
excuse for what I did.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.831
You don't need
a good excuse.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.877
You're in a union.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.665
Showtime.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.188
Mr. Wisney, would you
like to begin?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.801
Ladies and gentlemen
of the board,

07:33.888 --> 07:35.237
I'm not gonna
waste your time

07:35.324 --> 07:38.022
by rehashing
the so-called "incident"

07:38.109 --> 07:40.024
that may or may not have
occurred with Ms. Flynn.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.940
But what I will
discuss, though,

07:43.027 --> 07:45.813
is a woman who has
been a model teacher

07:45.900 --> 07:47.945
for ten long years.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.294
A decade.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.993
A third
of her life.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.562
Year after year,
day after day,

07:55.649 --> 07:58.086
for low pay

07:58.173 --> 08:01.742
and even less respect,

08:01.829 --> 08:03.091
this noble woman

08:03.178 --> 08:04.614
gave up her dreams

08:04.701 --> 08:07.530
to give the children
of Chicago theirs.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.188
I don't want to
teach anymore.
Shh.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.537
No, I just...
I don't want to do it.No, y-y-you...

08:14.624 --> 08:16.496
you don't...
you don't have to.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.888
Just show up,
play 'em a movie

08:17.975 --> 08:19.368
and cash your check.

08:20.195 --> 08:23.111
You're in a union.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.504
WILLIAMS:
Mr. Wisney?

08:24.591 --> 08:25.983
Sorry, sir.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.725
As I was saying,
Ms. Flynn represents

08:28.812 --> 08:31.249
all that is right
with our school system.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.424
Really?

08:32.512 --> 08:34.731
I jumped out a window.

08:34.818 --> 08:37.038
Sure, she's feisty
and outspoken.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.910
But do you know what else is?

08:39.997 --> 08:40.998
America.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.435
All right,
all right.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.002
I can't... I can't listen
to any more of this.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.222
Just park it.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.571
Okay, the...

08:48.658 --> 08:49.964
kids of Chicago
deserve teachers

08:50.051 --> 08:52.009
that care about them, who...

08:52.096 --> 08:54.534
who want to be there for them.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.013
And that...

08:56.100 --> 08:57.493
that may have been me
at one point,

08:57.580 --> 08:58.712
but it's not me now.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.671
I... something's changed in me,

09:01.758 --> 09:03.281
something's broken,

09:03.368 --> 09:05.501
or maybe something's fixed,
I don't know.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.417
But I know that
I can't do this one more day.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.810
You realize,
Ms. Flynn,

09:09.897 --> 09:11.333
if you quit you'll
lose your pension,

09:11.420 --> 09:13.465
your health care
and all your benefits.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.164
Really?

09:16.251 --> 09:18.253
Is that true?

09:23.084 --> 09:24.215
[sighs]

09:24.302 --> 09:25.782
No. No, no, no, no.
You know what?

09:25.869 --> 09:27.958
It's benefits that
suckered me into this

09:28.045 --> 09:29.525
in the first place.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.571
No, I am...
I am out of here.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.667
I just have to get my purse.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.105
Just-just...

09:47.935 --> 09:50.372
Why does your squad car
have an orange door?

09:51.286 --> 09:54.550
That's police business,
none of your concern.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.551
SAMUEL:
Fine.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.031
How's your wife doing?

09:57.118 --> 09:58.293
Have her marbles been located?

10:00.121 --> 10:02.036
You told him?

10:02.123 --> 10:03.820
We're roommates.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.300
We share what goes
on in our lives.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.954
And he knows what
happened to the car door.

10:07.041 --> 10:07.911
Then why'd you ask?

10:07.998 --> 10:09.304
It's a funny story.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.914
I wanted to hear
your version of it.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.700
My wife's doin' fine.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.136
Thanks for your concern.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.572
[phone ringing]

10:16.659 --> 10:17.878
In fact, that's
probably her

10:17.965 --> 10:19.140
telling me that
she's back to work.

10:19.227 --> 10:22.360
Hey, sweetie.
How'd it go?

10:23.840 --> 10:26.756
Yeah, my benefits
are pretty good, why?

10:33.589 --> 10:36.070
Here you go,
big guy.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.462
Thanks.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.029
My heart goes
out to you.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.944
I appreciate it.
Yeah.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.947
My cousin Petey put his
crazy wife in a home.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.169
Just outside of
Columbus, Ohio.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.214
Which is ideal
for your situation,

10:50.301 --> 10:51.433
because if Molly breaks out,

10:51.520 --> 10:53.653
she can't get to you on foot.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.264
Nobody's crazy,

10:56.351 --> 10:57.657
and nobody's going in a home.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.485
Yet.

11:00.572 --> 11:04.272
She's just working
some things out.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.665
Hey, I'm not
judging.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.710
If anything,
I'm jealous.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.061
Of what?

11:11.148 --> 11:12.454
It's a well-known fact

11:12.541 --> 11:13.847
that mentally unstable women

11:13.934 --> 11:16.197
are wildcats
in between the sheets.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.069
You, my friend, will be

11:19.156 --> 11:21.898
the grateful beneficiary
of said madness.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.421
Oh...

11:25.032 --> 11:25.946
See you later.

11:26.033 --> 11:26.947
Whoa, whoa, uh...

11:27.034 --> 11:28.339
Where-where you going?

11:28.426 --> 11:29.776
Just out
for a drink.
Okay, well,

11:29.863 --> 11:31.865
hang on a second,
let me put on my shoes.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.694
Oh, no, sweetie, you stay here.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.087
For the kind of dark, ugly
drinking I'm gonna do tonight

11:37.174 --> 11:40.569
I need the company of some
hardcore booze bags.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.223
We're ready!

11:42.310 --> 11:44.051
Let's go before
my afternoon
buzz wears off.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.055
[door closes]

11:50.710 --> 11:53.103
You should limber up
before she comes home.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.807
No, you know what
the real problem is...

12:00.894 --> 12:02.765
is that I'm just so angry.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.288
At Mike?
No.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.463
At me?

12:05.550 --> 12:06.900
No, why would I be angry at you?

12:06.987 --> 12:09.380
Never mind.

12:09.467 --> 12:12.166
No, the one I'm really
mad at is me.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.297
Why?

12:13.384 --> 12:15.169
You're such
a nice person.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.170
No, I'm not nice.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.519
I'm a phony

12:17.606 --> 12:19.260
and-and a fraud.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.653
I didn't become a teacher
because it was my passion.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.438
I did it because it was safe

12:23.525 --> 12:26.006
and I was too scared
to go after my real dream.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.051
Oh, that just
breaks my heart.

12:28.138 --> 12:28.965
Honey, what is it you
really wanted to do?

12:29.052 --> 12:29.966
Yeah.
Forget it.

12:30.053 --> 12:30.750
It doesn't matter now.

12:30.837 --> 12:31.620
Don't say that.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.275
What is your dream?

12:34.362 --> 12:35.450
Come on.
We're family.
Yes.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.756
You can tell us
anything.

12:36.843 --> 12:37.582
No, you're just
gonna laugh.

12:37.669 --> 12:38.975
No.
No.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.368
Whatever it is,
we support you 100%.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.025
Musical theater.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.378
Well, that's just
ridiculous.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.295
[knocking at door]

12:55.252 --> 12:57.254
Hey, this is
a surprise.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.690
I brought you some
tuna noodle casserole

12:58.778 --> 12:59.866
from the school
cafeteria.

12:59.953 --> 13:02.825
Aw, you didn't
have to do that.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.131
You're my son.
I love you.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.741
Where's the Nutty
Professor?

13:08.526 --> 13:09.745
Ah, geez.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.268
Does everybody
at the school know?

13:11.355 --> 13:13.140
Gossip is the fuel
that heats that place.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.360
I even saw the Deaf kids
signing about it.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.148
Well, don't worry,
she's-she's doing good.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.192
Really?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.585
I don't speak Deaf,

13:23.672 --> 13:26.109
but I know this
means "crazy."

13:26.196 --> 13:29.417
Come on, let's go
heat this up.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.549
The truth is,
I have no idea

13:31.636 --> 13:33.160
what's going on
with Molly.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.597
Well, I don't want
to throw salt on the wound,

13:35.684 --> 13:36.946
but if you two
ever have kids,

13:37.033 --> 13:38.687
you should know you got loony

13:38.774 --> 13:40.428
on your dad's side, too.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.345
For the last time,
she's not loony.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.390
She's just going
through something.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.609
Welcome to marriage.

13:47.696 --> 13:48.784
People change.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.134
They get old, they get grumpy,

13:51.221 --> 13:53.702
they get ugly
as a monkey's butt.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.009
But you stay.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.619
And you know why?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.664
Because you promised
Jesus to stick it out.

13:59.751 --> 14:00.622
[microwave beeping]

14:00.709 --> 14:03.407
Just remember,

14:03.494 --> 14:05.627
marriage is not for
the faint of heart.

14:05.714 --> 14:06.846
I'll never understand

14:06.933 --> 14:08.891
why the gays
want it so bad.

14:10.806 --> 14:11.720
But who knows?

14:11.807 --> 14:13.678
Maybe they'll fix it up

14:13.765 --> 14:14.854
like they do a sketchy
neighborhood.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.771
♪ A boy like that
who'd kill your brother ♪

14:19.859 --> 14:22.296
♪ Forget that boy
and find another ♪

14:22.383 --> 14:23.688
♪ One of your own kind ♪

14:23.775 --> 14:26.430
♪ Stick to your own kind. ♪

14:26.517 --> 14:27.779
[laughing]

14:27.867 --> 14:29.694
See?

14:29.781 --> 14:32.393
It just feels good to sing.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.134
Oh...

14:34.221 --> 14:35.962
Well, honey, if that's what
you really want to do,

14:36.049 --> 14:37.224
we support you.

14:37.311 --> 14:40.314
Yeah, even if you
have no talent.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.664
Oh, thank you for saying that,
that's so sweet...

14:42.751 --> 14:43.665
Oh!

14:43.752 --> 14:45.232
Excuse me.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.668
[laughing]

14:46.755 --> 14:48.496
You know what the best part

14:48.583 --> 14:50.846
of all of this is?

14:50.933 --> 14:54.806
Is just kind of getting back
with you guys, you know?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.286
Oh...Just... guh, locking in,

14:56.373 --> 15:00.160
and with Mike and work
and, you know,

15:00.247 --> 15:01.161
trying to have a baby,
I just...

15:01.248 --> 15:03.380
forgot about my two...

15:03.467 --> 15:04.642
[clicks tongue]

15:04.729 --> 15:05.513
...best friends.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.645
Aw...
Aw...

15:07.732 --> 15:09.256
We were always
there for you.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.649
Yeah, all you had
to do was knock.

15:11.736 --> 15:12.476
Oh, I am!

15:12.563 --> 15:13.825
I'm knocking now!

15:13.913 --> 15:14.957
Who's there?

15:15.044 --> 15:16.306
It's me...Who is there?

15:16.393 --> 15:17.612
Whoa!

15:17.699 --> 15:18.656
Hey.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.528
Do you have a problem?

15:20.615 --> 15:22.965
You mean besides
the loud drunks
at the next table?

15:23.052 --> 15:25.272
I'm sorry, we didn't hear them.

15:25.359 --> 15:26.708
We were singing.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.493
[laughing]

15:29.580 --> 15:31.843
Boy, this one's drunk,
loud and stupid.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.628
Hey.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.456
You better watch
your mouth, Sasquatch.

15:35.543 --> 15:36.892
All right.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.241
Okay, take...
take it easy, Mom.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.721
Oh, this is
your mom?

15:39.808 --> 15:42.680
Well, how did that
come out of that?

15:42.767 --> 15:44.204
Say that again

15:44.291 --> 15:45.118
and I'll kick you
in the balls.Okay.

15:45.205 --> 15:48.686
All right, all right.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.950
All right, I think you
just need to... to back off.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.648
Oh, what you
gonna do, Stumpy?

15:53.735 --> 15:54.823
Fight me?

15:54.910 --> 15:56.912
No.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.174
I'm not gonna
fight you.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.741
And I have a very
good reason...

15:59.828 --> 16:01.221
I have three of them.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.613
Number one...

16:05.007 --> 16:05.965
Run! Run...

16:11.231 --> 16:14.364
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.671
Ow, ah...

16:16.758 --> 16:18.542
Ow.

16:18.629 --> 16:19.674
Hey.
Hey...

16:19.761 --> 16:21.458
Thought I heard
you up here.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.591
Hey there,
hi there.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.072
What happened
to your hand?

16:26.159 --> 16:28.117
Oh, I just, you know,
took a little spill.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.423
Scraped
my knuckles.

16:29.510 --> 16:30.467
Let me see.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.642
Oh, it's...
not a...

16:31.729 --> 16:32.992
it's not a...
Let me see.

16:34.602 --> 16:37.213
Oh, sweetie,
it's all bruised.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.215
What is that,
a tooth?

16:39.302 --> 16:40.564
No.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.566
No, it's a...
it's a pebble.

16:42.653 --> 16:43.785
You drink a lot,
you fall a lot...

16:43.872 --> 16:46.614
like you do.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.442
My poor wife.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.965
You're having a hell
of a time, aren't you?

16:50.052 --> 16:51.097
It hasn't been

16:51.184 --> 16:53.751
the best
couple of days.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.623
And I...
ow...

16:55.710 --> 16:56.885
...owe you
an apology.

16:56.972 --> 16:57.929
For what?

16:58.017 --> 17:01.150
So many things.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.805
Quitting my job
without talking to you.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.547
Making you live here and
put up with my family.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.027
Keeping secret
credit cards.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.376
What?
Just...

17:09.463 --> 17:11.421
let me finish.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.904
Most of all,
for not being able

17:15.991 --> 17:17.732
to give you the baby
I know you wanted so much.

17:20.474 --> 17:21.997
Hey.

17:22.084 --> 17:25.305
I don't want you
to worry about that.

17:25.392 --> 17:29.570
That baby'll come whenever
it's supposed to come.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.789
And if it doesn't,

17:31.876 --> 17:32.964
we'll deal with it.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.705
Really?

17:34.792 --> 17:36.490
Yeah.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.797
The important
thing is that

17:39.884 --> 17:41.930
no matter what's
going on around us,

17:42.017 --> 17:44.019
we stay tight.

17:44.106 --> 17:44.933
Stay connected.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.891
Yeah, of course.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.590
And be honest
with each other,

17:49.677 --> 17:51.505
no matter what.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.377
Yeah, goes
without saying.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.770
Good.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.032
Now, uh,

17:57.119 --> 17:58.947
I'm gonna give you
one more try.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.253
Explain to me
why this pebble

18:00.340 --> 18:02.081
has a gold filling.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.962
You know, there's
something so freeing

18:14.049 --> 18:15.790
about knowing that
my whole future
is wide open.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.792
Uh-huh.
I don't ever have
to make sacrifices.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.838
I can feel free
to pursue my dream

18:20.925 --> 18:22.449
to sing and dance
on Broadway,

18:22.536 --> 18:23.754
or, you know, I can
get going on that book

18:23.841 --> 18:25.365
I've been meaning
to write.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.801
Or maybe I'll just
open my own business

18:26.888 --> 18:29.325
and get filthy rich.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.631
I like that third one.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.329
It's just time
management, really.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.765
Are you gonna be okay

18:34.852 --> 18:35.984
with me making
more money than you?

18:36.071 --> 18:37.246
You did when
you were a teacher.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.769
[laughs]

18:38.856 --> 18:40.206
You know the first
thing I'm gonna buy

18:40.293 --> 18:41.729
is a new car for you.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.034
Sure.
Like a sports car?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.775
Oh, God, no.

18:44.862 --> 18:45.776
You'd look like
Fred Flintstone
in a sports car.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.345
Will you be insulted
if I buy myself

18:49.432 --> 18:51.173
a bigger
engagement ring?

18:51.260 --> 18:53.219
Have at it.
Okay.

18:53.306 --> 18:54.872
I mean, I'm gonna
keep the old one.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.352
You know, maybe make it
into a necklace, or...

18:56.439 --> 18:59.007
oh, maybe like a...
a diamond stud earring.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.443
[clicks tongue]
For you.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.705
Good night.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.403
All right.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.232
Oh, boy.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.277
[sighs]

19:11.846 --> 19:13.630
Oh, God,
what have I done?

19:13.717 --> 19:14.805
Come here.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.067
Oh, my God,
why did I...

19:16.155 --> 19:17.417
quit my job, and...

19:17.504 --> 19:18.853
