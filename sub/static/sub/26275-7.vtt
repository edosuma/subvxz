WEBVTT

00:00.078 --> 00:01.166
Only on Fox.

00:05.475 --> 00:07.041
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

00:07.085 --> 00:09.261
This is a nice surprise.
Hard day at work,

00:09.305 --> 00:11.263
come home to my hot teacher.

00:11.307 --> 00:13.526
[laughs]
Yeah.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.485
More like terrific tutor.

00:15.528 --> 00:16.921
How are your students doing?

00:16.964 --> 00:18.923
-They are acing this quiz.
-Yeah?

00:18.966 --> 00:20.751
-Yeah.
-Give me one of the questions.

00:20.794 --> 00:22.448
All right.
Uh, here, question four.

00:22.492 --> 00:25.103
"What is the highest place
on Earth?"

00:25.146 --> 00:26.278
Highest place on Earth.

00:26.322 --> 00:28.498
Easy. UC Berkeley.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.195
[stomps foot]

00:31.327 --> 00:33.894
[coughs]
I don't even go here.

00:37.594 --> 00:39.335
Mount Everest.

00:39.378 --> 00:42.338
-Of course.
-Boom! Can this woman tutor?

00:42.381 --> 00:44.296
[laughs]

00:44.340 --> 00:46.472
I don't know if this is
frightening or arousing.

00:46.516 --> 00:50.476
"What is a mixture of igneous
and metamorphic rock?"

00:50.520 --> 00:52.565
-Um...
-Migmatite.

00:52.609 --> 00:53.740
Oh, yeah.

00:53.784 --> 00:56.134
Geology, suckas!

00:57.483 --> 01:00.269
Oh, yeah.
This is arousing.

01:01.357 --> 01:03.446
What do you say we go upstairs?

01:03.489 --> 01:05.361
No, honey, we can't.
Mandy's gonna come home

01:05.404 --> 01:07.188
any minute, and she's
gonna be pretty upset.

01:07.232 --> 01:08.581
About what?

01:08.625 --> 01:10.017
Well, that fashion website

01:10.061 --> 01:12.150
she submitted
her proposed collection to

01:12.193 --> 01:13.586
gave their answer.

01:13.630 --> 01:15.806
Modern Mode?
They rejected all her proposals?

01:15.849 --> 01:17.329
Yeah, the whole line.

01:17.373 --> 01:20.027
Eh, what do those
fashion Einsteins know anyway?

01:20.071 --> 01:21.768
They couldn't tell
the difference

01:21.812 --> 01:24.293
between an A-line and a B cup.

01:26.207 --> 01:28.253
Project Runway.Tim Gunn.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.255
-Best thing on TV.
-Oh. Well...

01:30.299 --> 01:32.213
Buona sera,beautiful parents.

01:32.257 --> 01:33.693
We have awesome news.

01:33.737 --> 01:36.479
Ah. Certainly handles
disappointment well.

01:36.522 --> 01:39.003
Listen, for the record,
I'm only smiling right now

01:39.046 --> 01:40.831
because you brought pizza.

01:40.874 --> 01:43.834
Honey, we thought you'd still
be crushed about Modern Mode.

01:43.877 --> 01:46.010
Oh. She was.
She printed out the logo

01:46.053 --> 01:48.360
and used it as a dartboard.

01:48.404 --> 01:52.538
It would be full of holes
if she was better at darts.

01:53.626 --> 01:56.499
But when Mandy's down,
we get pizza.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.501
-All right.
-Which was genius,

01:58.544 --> 02:00.851
because on the wall of Arturo's
is a map of Italy.

02:00.894 --> 02:02.809
And guess where
Kyle and I are going?

02:02.853 --> 02:04.420
Italy!

02:04.463 --> 02:08.075
Sorry. I get so excited
when I know the answer.

02:09.686 --> 02:11.252
I worked super hard on a line

02:11.296 --> 02:13.254
that got turned down
by a bunch of idiots.

02:13.298 --> 02:14.604
I need a vacation.

02:14.647 --> 02:17.258
Oh. Well, who's gonna pay
for the vacation?

02:17.302 --> 02:20.044
Well, we've been saving
a lot of money, Dad.

02:20.087 --> 02:23.395
Living rent-free here.
I forgot.

02:23.439 --> 02:25.266
Well, we didn't--
that's why we

02:25.310 --> 02:27.356
haven't been
paying you anything.

02:28.531 --> 02:30.228
This is gonna be so much fun.

02:30.271 --> 02:33.274
I can't wait to go
to every city on this pizza box.

02:33.318 --> 02:35.668
Ooh. Let's go to Nipples.

02:41.848 --> 02:43.894
Naples.

02:43.937 --> 02:46.113
♪

02:50.509 --> 02:53.556
Um, listen, your mom and I
were talking upstairs,

02:53.599 --> 02:55.471
and we think you're making
a big mistake, okay?

02:55.514 --> 02:58.343
-Huh.
-We don't think
you should go to Italy.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.084
But I just filled out
a BuzzFeed quiz

03:00.127 --> 03:01.912
on what type
of Italian food I am.

03:01.955 --> 03:03.696
I'm a cannoli.

03:03.740 --> 03:07.004
Well, we didn't have that
information, so arrivederci.

03:07.047 --> 03:10.573
Mandy, the deal was we would
let you use the bomb shelter

03:10.616 --> 03:13.706
as a studio so you could
save money for the business.

03:13.750 --> 03:18.232
You know, not traipse around
Tuscany like Diane Lane.

03:18.276 --> 03:20.452
-I saw the movie.
-[mouths]

03:20.496 --> 03:23.455
You're making it sound like I'm
using yourmoney for the trip.

03:23.499 --> 03:25.588
-Oh, I'm sorry, I just mean...
-[chuckles]

03:25.631 --> 03:29.069
We weren't being clear. You're
using our money for the trip.

03:29.113 --> 03:30.593
MIKE:
Look, we support you

03:30.636 --> 03:32.682
in trying to get your business
off the ground.

03:32.725 --> 03:36.468
What we can't sign off on is you
wasting money on travel, okay?

03:36.512 --> 03:39.340
But you always said travel
was the best education.

03:39.384 --> 03:42.561
I was right then,
and I'm right now.

03:42.605 --> 03:44.345
VANESSA:
You've had a setback, okay?

03:44.389 --> 03:46.130
And I'm sure the next thing
that you submit

03:46.173 --> 03:48.567
will be accepted, and-and then
you're gonna need that money

03:48.611 --> 03:50.134
-for supplies.
-Look at it this way.

03:50.177 --> 03:53.659
When God slams a door shut, he
generally builds you a window.

03:53.703 --> 03:57.315
Dad, why is everything with you
home improvement?

04:02.320 --> 04:04.627
Chuck, uh, is my dad in there?

04:04.670 --> 04:08.065
No. And just because
my desk is here

04:08.108 --> 04:11.503
doesn't make me
your dad's receptionist.

04:11.547 --> 04:16.377
But would you like to leave
a message for Mr. Baxter?

04:16.421 --> 04:18.728
No. Uh, actually,
I want to surprise him.

04:18.771 --> 04:20.643
I'm gonna upgrade
the website for the restaurant.

04:20.686 --> 04:22.732
You know, he's been working
so hard on the expansion,

04:22.775 --> 04:25.299
I just want him to have
one less thing to worry about.

04:25.343 --> 04:26.953
Okay. So,
what are you doing here?

04:26.997 --> 04:30.566
Well, you do a lot of camera
stuff around here. [chuckles]

04:30.609 --> 04:32.524
So I want to make a video
for the home page,

04:32.568 --> 04:35.309
and I just have
one little question.

04:35.353 --> 04:37.660
-Okay, what?
-How do I do it?

04:37.703 --> 04:40.750
As it turns out, I used to work
in video production

04:40.793 --> 04:42.316
when I was in the Marines.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.405
-What?
-Yes. I produced
a recruitment spot

04:44.449 --> 04:47.757
where a farm boy looks up
from a cornfield,

04:47.800 --> 04:51.804
sees an eagle soaring by,
follows it to a hilltop...

04:51.848 --> 04:53.676
Where a sword of destiny
waits for him?

04:53.719 --> 04:55.416
-Yeah.
-I saw that.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.418
Oh, yeah? All right, yes.

04:57.462 --> 04:59.986
Thank you. Yeah, 12% increase
in recruitment.

05:00.030 --> 05:02.423
-Wow.
-Yeah. If I could do that
for the Marines,

05:02.467 --> 05:04.991
[chuckles] I can make a video
for Outdoor Man Grill.

05:05.035 --> 05:06.689
-Thank you, Chuck.
-Oh, yeah.

05:06.732 --> 05:08.386
I-I don't want
to put you out, though.

05:08.429 --> 05:10.431
-Oh. [sputters]
-It sounds like a lot of work.

05:10.475 --> 05:13.739
-No...
-What's a lot of work?
I'll do it.

05:13.783 --> 05:16.568
Uh, you don't even know
what it is, Ed.

05:16.612 --> 05:20.572
Yeah, it doesn't matter. I'm
retired and I'm losing my mind.

05:20.616 --> 05:23.662
I just came back
from playing pickleball.

05:23.706 --> 05:26.796
Okay, well, uh,
Chuck and I are going to shoot

05:26.839 --> 05:29.146
a new promo
for the Grill's website.

05:29.189 --> 05:31.757
That sounds
like a terrific idea.

05:31.801 --> 05:33.454
But make sure it's classy.

05:33.498 --> 05:36.936
And nothing says classy
like a spokesman in a tuxedo.

05:36.980 --> 05:40.505
Hmm? I have four.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.551
Four wives, four tuxedos.

05:43.682 --> 05:46.859
For this one,
I'd wear the Mary Ann.

05:46.903 --> 05:49.732
Okay. Uh, are you sure, Ed?

05:49.775 --> 05:52.256
[chuckles]: I mean, acting
is harder than it looks.

05:52.299 --> 05:54.650
Trust me, I'm a natural.

05:54.693 --> 05:55.999
I know all the tricks.

05:56.042 --> 05:59.611
As much as I love the camera,
it loves me more.

05:59.655 --> 06:01.482
Thank you, Ed.
It's gonna be great.

06:01.526 --> 06:03.528
Yeah. I'll round up
the in-house production guys.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.834
Kristin, you write up the copy.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.705
Ed, take Mary Ann
to the cleaners.

06:06.749 --> 06:08.054
All right.

06:08.098 --> 06:12.232
With pleasure, with-- her lawyer
did the same to me in '86.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.498
That took a long time.
That place was packed, honey.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.762
Moo goo gai pan.

06:19.805 --> 06:22.765
You know, I bet the progressives
are gonna make us call this

06:22.808 --> 06:25.550
moo goo gender-neutral pan.

06:25.594 --> 06:26.682
I don't care what it's called,

06:26.725 --> 06:28.335
just put it in plates.
I'm starving.

06:28.379 --> 06:29.989
Yeah, me, too. Ooh.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.861
Oh, hey, honey. You hungry?

06:31.904 --> 06:34.080
No. What I am is stunned,

06:34.124 --> 06:35.865
-grateful and in awe.
-Oh.

06:35.908 --> 06:39.085
Perfect, 'cause there's only
enough food for your mom and me.

06:39.129 --> 06:43.307
Uh, so, stunned, grateful
and in awe about what?

06:43.350 --> 06:47.093
God. And my friend Annie
from high school.

06:47.137 --> 06:49.008
Oh, that sketchy cheerleader
who got suspended

06:49.052 --> 06:51.445
for selling her ADD meds?

06:51.489 --> 06:54.797
God, cheerleader,
prescription meds.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.538
This is gonna be
a hell of a story.

06:57.582 --> 07:00.019
One day after those weasels
from Modern Mode

07:00.063 --> 07:03.675
turn down my fashion submission,
guess who calls me?

07:03.719 --> 07:04.937
God.

07:04.981 --> 07:06.722
No. Annie,

07:06.765 --> 07:08.811
who is now a successful
real estate agent.

07:08.854 --> 07:10.769
-VANESSA: Oh.
-She invites me to lunch,

07:10.813 --> 07:14.817
we talk, and we wind up
sitting for two hours.

07:14.860 --> 07:18.516
Sounds like the waiter could
have used the ADD medicine.

07:18.559 --> 07:20.344
The moment I stood up
from that table,

07:20.387 --> 07:23.695
I knew what I wanted
to do with my life.

07:23.739 --> 07:25.523
Th-- what are you talking about?

07:25.566 --> 07:28.744
I'm going to become
a real estate agent.

07:28.787 --> 07:30.746
W-What? What about fashion?

07:30.789 --> 07:32.356
It's what you said
yesterday, Dad.

07:32.399 --> 07:34.837
When God closes a door,
he builds a window.

07:34.880 --> 07:39.755
Fashion is the door,
real estate is the window.

07:39.798 --> 07:42.714
-Come on, isn't this incredible?
-No-- wait, wait.

07:42.758 --> 07:45.586
[sighs]
You and your home improvement.

07:53.769 --> 07:56.728
Mike? Oh, hey, hi.
Listen, uh, great news.

07:56.772 --> 07:59.078
I've been doing some research,
and it turns out

07:59.122 --> 08:01.777
that Mandy will have to do
a ton of work

08:01.820 --> 08:03.996
if she wants to be
a real estate agent. Huh?

08:04.040 --> 08:06.303
This will destroy her.
[chuckles]

08:06.346 --> 08:07.739
It's true what they say.

08:07.783 --> 08:10.960
There's nothing quite
like a mother's love.

08:11.003 --> 08:12.918
Okay, all right, all right,
I get it, I get it.

08:12.962 --> 08:14.964
I'm just-- I'll take anything
if it gets

08:15.007 --> 08:17.793
this silly real estate notion
out of her head.

08:17.836 --> 08:20.970
You got to admit-- pretty girl,
bubbly personality--

08:21.013 --> 08:25.148
it's almost like Mandy was
created in a lab to sell houses.

08:25.191 --> 08:27.454
Hold on, hold on.
You're, you're not on board

08:27.498 --> 08:28.934
with this crazy idea, are you?

08:28.978 --> 08:31.589
I'm not even sure Mandy's
on board with this.

08:31.632 --> 08:34.026
Selling real estate
is a rebound career.

08:34.070 --> 08:36.202
It's not the career you marry.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.204
Well, sometimes, you make
a mistake when you marry,

08:38.248 --> 08:40.119
and you don't realize it until
you need somebody's support

08:40.163 --> 08:41.686
and it's not there.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.820
I mean, w-why aren't you
more upset about this?

08:44.863 --> 08:47.779
Because I don't think
you meant to insult me.

08:47.823 --> 08:51.827
About Mandy.
Look, fashion is her life.

08:51.870 --> 08:54.220
She didn't draw "for sale" signs
on her school notebooks,

08:54.264 --> 08:56.353
she drew dresses.

08:56.396 --> 09:01.227
She also wrote "Mrs. Ricky
Martin" in that notebook.

09:01.271 --> 09:03.882
All I'm saying here, honey,
is things change.

09:03.926 --> 09:06.624
Just ask Ricky's husband.

09:09.845 --> 09:13.979
Pull back to reveal
the roasted potato.

09:14.023 --> 09:15.415
Enter Ed!

09:20.681 --> 09:22.945
Uh, E-Ed, uh, your line is...

09:22.988 --> 09:24.511
I know my line.

09:25.556 --> 09:27.819
Then why didn't you say it?

09:27.863 --> 09:31.040
First I say it with my eyes,
then my mouth.

09:31.083 --> 09:35.087
Let's skip the eyes
and go straight to the mouth.

09:35.131 --> 09:37.481
And action.

09:37.524 --> 09:39.396
Hello, I'm Ed Alzate.

09:39.439 --> 09:41.050
Welcome
to the Outdoor Man Grill.

09:41.093 --> 09:42.703
[whispering]:
Where your taste buds

09:42.747 --> 09:44.923
take a trip around the world.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.884
[chuckles]
Ed,

09:48.927 --> 09:50.929
why are you talking like that?

09:50.973 --> 09:52.452
It's an old stage technique.

09:52.496 --> 09:55.064
It forces people
to listen more closely.

09:55.107 --> 09:56.674
It's called whispering.

09:56.717 --> 09:58.850
We're running
out of time, Kristin.

09:58.894 --> 10:00.547
We've been working
on this scene all morning.

10:00.591 --> 10:03.115
Do we have
a-a good version of it?

10:03.159 --> 10:05.291
You mean, has he said
what you wrote? Yes.

10:05.335 --> 10:06.727
In a way we can hear it?

10:06.771 --> 10:07.903
[whispers]:
No.

10:07.946 --> 10:10.079
Uh, okay.

10:10.122 --> 10:11.515
Uh...
[chuckles]

10:11.558 --> 10:13.865
Let's do your-your line
at the table.

10:13.909 --> 10:17.086
Ah, perfect, perfect.
Moving to the table, everyone.

10:20.785 --> 10:22.961
[muttering]

10:25.485 --> 10:29.315
Now, uh, so, your line here
is, "Everything on our menu

10:29.359 --> 10:31.100
is fresh, exotic and delicious."

10:31.143 --> 10:33.232
Uh-uh-uh.
There's something wrong here.

10:33.276 --> 10:35.931
There should be champagne
on this table.

10:35.974 --> 10:37.149
It's their anniversary.

10:37.193 --> 10:40.326
That-that's not anywhere
in the script, Ed.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.894
Well, i-it's called backstory.
It's essential for the actors.

10:42.938 --> 10:45.070
They're not actors,
they're from accounting.

10:47.159 --> 10:49.161
And what's with the wine?

10:49.205 --> 10:52.034
A man such as I would start
the evening with a martini.

10:52.077 --> 10:56.081
Okay. Let's just take it
from the top, everybody.

10:56.125 --> 10:58.562
[stammers]
I have... I have a better idea.

10:58.605 --> 11:00.781
Let's just, uh,
let the cameras roll,

11:00.825 --> 11:03.306
and let's see
if we-we get lucky. All right?

11:03.349 --> 11:05.177
-Ed, that's not how this w...
-Ah, no, no, no.

11:05.221 --> 11:06.570
Trust me.
Some of the best moments

11:06.613 --> 11:08.137
in cinema were ad-libbed.

11:08.180 --> 11:09.312
Right? Such as, uh...

11:09.355 --> 11:12.010
"I'm walkin' here!"

11:17.842 --> 11:19.626
-Hi, Mom.
-No, I'm not your mom.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.759
I'm your reality check,
so brace yourself.

11:21.802 --> 11:23.326
I am coming in hot.

11:23.369 --> 11:24.718
What's that?

11:24.762 --> 11:26.198
This is the next six months
of your life,

11:26.242 --> 11:29.071
otherwise known as
the Colorado Real Estate Manual,

11:29.114 --> 11:31.029
so you have fun
getting through that.

11:31.073 --> 11:32.944
I-I'm already reading it.
I'm just doing it in a way

11:32.988 --> 11:36.992
that's much more efficient.
Aw, my battery just died.

11:37.035 --> 11:39.081
All right, all right. Wait,
wait, wait. No, I'm not done.

11:39.124 --> 11:41.170
Nope. How about this?
This is a schedule

11:41.213 --> 11:44.869
of 150 hours of classes
you're gonna need to take.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.219
Yeah, classes. Your favorite.

11:47.263 --> 11:49.961
Actually,
it's 168 hours of classes

11:50.005 --> 11:51.093
and then the broker exam.

11:51.136 --> 11:53.008
I also need
a sponsoring realty company,

11:53.051 --> 11:55.184
which is why I'm meeting
with Annie and her boss. Ooh.

11:55.227 --> 11:58.796
I got to go. Oh,
consider this reality checked.

11:58.839 --> 12:01.190
Hey, Mandy, Mandy, Mandy.

12:01.233 --> 12:02.539
What if you don't pass

12:02.582 --> 12:04.019
the broker exam, huh?
Then what then?

12:04.062 --> 12:07.109
Mom, if I don't pass,
I'll take it again.

12:07.152 --> 12:09.198
-See you later, Dad.
-See you.

12:09.241 --> 12:10.982
[grunts]

12:11.026 --> 12:12.418
[sighs]

12:12.462 --> 12:15.987
You know, I could've used
your support right then.

12:18.120 --> 12:23.212
I'd like to be supportive
like Ricky Martin's husband.

12:23.255 --> 12:26.215
-"Cheer up, Ricky.
Let's have some eggs."
-Oh.

12:26.258 --> 12:30.001
Come on, honey. What is it?
What is really going on here?

12:30.045 --> 12:34.049
I don't want her to be like me.
I want her to be more like you.

12:34.092 --> 12:35.615
What is that supposed to mean?

12:35.659 --> 12:38.270
-I got a doctorate in Geology
because I loved it.
-Yeah.

12:38.314 --> 12:40.577
-I got it, yeah.
-And then I took
that job at Paxon

12:40.620 --> 12:43.014
because-because I didn't know
what to do with it.

12:43.058 --> 12:45.886
Right? And then it took me
two decades to figure out

12:45.930 --> 12:48.454
that what I really wanted
was to teach it.

12:48.498 --> 12:50.021
And you have been teaching.
Y-You're tutoring.

12:50.065 --> 12:51.718
You love it.
You reinvented yourself.

12:51.762 --> 12:53.938
You're like Reagan but prettier.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.723
Honey, I didn't know
what my passion was,

12:56.767 --> 12:58.247
so I just took the first thing
that came along.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.901
Mandy has always known
what she wanted.

13:00.945 --> 13:02.251
I just... I can't stand it

13:02.294 --> 13:04.296
-that she's not going after it.
-All right, all right.

13:04.340 --> 13:06.124
All right. You know, I think
I get where you're going,

13:06.168 --> 13:07.517
-and I'm sorry
I didn't pick this up for...
-No, no.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.910
No. Look, don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry. Be grateful.

13:09.954 --> 13:11.695
You have always known
what your dream is,

13:11.738 --> 13:13.958
and you made it come true.

13:23.489 --> 13:26.927
Kristin, I want to apologize
about the other day. Uh...

13:26.971 --> 13:28.755
I'm afraid
I got a little carried away.

13:28.799 --> 13:31.715
No, no. No, you were...

13:31.758 --> 13:34.892
You looked so good in that tux.

13:34.935 --> 13:37.155
Well, I-- the fact is,
I was so excited

13:37.199 --> 13:39.897
to be doing
something meaningful, I...

13:39.940 --> 13:42.160
I became a bit of a jackass.

13:42.204 --> 13:43.466
Hey, guys.

13:43.509 --> 13:45.294
-You ready to watch the video?
-Oh, no, no, Chuck.

13:45.337 --> 13:47.339
You don't have to do that.
You don't have to do that.

13:47.383 --> 13:48.993
I'll pay to do it over.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.734
You just hire a real spokesman.

13:50.777 --> 13:52.518
I'll just stay out of the way.

13:52.562 --> 13:55.173
Now, h-hang on, now.
I-I worked pretty hard on this,

13:55.217 --> 13:57.741
-and I'd like you guys
to see it.
-Oh, come on.

13:57.784 --> 14:00.004
♪

14:03.355 --> 14:08.099
CHUCK: Greetings. I'm Ed Alzate
of the Outdoor Man Grill.

14:08.143 --> 14:09.492
[laughs]

14:09.535 --> 14:13.322
Where your taste buds will take an adventure around the world.

14:13.365 --> 14:18.762
Everything on our menu is fresh, exotic and delicious.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.027
From our sizzling-- ooh--

14:23.071 --> 14:26.335
hot entrées

14:26.378 --> 14:28.598
to our excellent selection
of wines.

14:28.641 --> 14:30.382
Yes, sirree.

14:30.426 --> 14:32.210
Come for the food.

14:32.254 --> 14:34.038
Come for the fun.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.128
Come for the best meal
of your life.

14:37.172 --> 14:40.175
You'll take one look
at our menu and say,

14:40.218 --> 14:43.961
"I'm eating here!"

14:44.004 --> 14:46.398
That is so good.

14:46.442 --> 14:48.487
I did a little nip-tuck
with the editing.

14:48.531 --> 14:50.968
You know, worked on the sound.

14:51.011 --> 14:53.362
Glad you like it, Kristin.

14:53.405 --> 14:55.277
Ed?

14:56.191 --> 14:57.931
I thought I knew some tricks,

14:57.975 --> 15:00.412
but looks like you know some,
too, Chuck.

15:00.456 --> 15:02.545
[chuckles]:
Oh, yeah.

15:02.588 --> 15:05.243
And I can't deny it, Ed.
The camera does love you, man.

15:05.287 --> 15:06.810
-Oh.
-You were wonderful, Ed.

15:06.853 --> 15:09.378
[chuckles] Well, it was terrific
to be, to be part of a team,

15:09.421 --> 15:12.250
especially one
that isn't playing pickleball.

15:12.294 --> 15:13.643
So come on, let's go celebrate

15:13.686 --> 15:16.167
in that lovely restaurant
of yours, and it's on me.

15:16.211 --> 15:17.864
-Come on.
-Okay.
-All right.

15:17.908 --> 15:19.214
I have a screenplay
I'd like you to read.

15:19.257 --> 15:21.390
It's, uh, it opens on me,
all right,

15:21.433 --> 15:25.307
in a speedboat
on the Riviera. Okay...

15:27.396 --> 15:30.399
-MANDY: Hey, Dad?
-I'm in here.

15:30.442 --> 15:33.053
Oh, hi. Kyle said
you needed my help.

15:33.097 --> 15:35.055
Yeah, it's a real estate
question, actually.

15:35.099 --> 15:37.275
I was wondering if you think
that this bomb shelter

15:37.319 --> 15:40.452
could be an asset
i-if I ever sold this house.

15:40.496 --> 15:42.193
Oh, yes, definitely.
What you do is,

15:42.237 --> 15:45.544
you call it a bomb shelter
slash wine cellar.

15:45.588 --> 15:47.459
I can see the marketing now:

15:47.503 --> 15:50.462
"Get bombed
while you're being bombed."

15:50.506 --> 15:51.811
[mouths]

15:51.855 --> 15:53.465
Actually, I was hoping
I could get you

15:53.509 --> 15:56.207
to pack all this stuff
and, uh, get it out.

15:56.251 --> 15:58.427
Why? [gasps] Oh, my gosh,
are you selling the house?

15:58.470 --> 16:00.777
Wait till I get my license,
I want the listing.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.257
No, no, I just, I want you

16:02.300 --> 16:03.606
to pack everything up
and get it out of here.

16:03.649 --> 16:06.304
You won't need it, 'cause
you're gonna be a realtor.

16:06.348 --> 16:08.654
Wait, but it's not like
I'm never gonna design again.

16:08.698 --> 16:10.874
I'm just taking a little break.

16:10.917 --> 16:12.223
Oh, that's not what
it sounded like.

16:12.267 --> 16:13.398
It sounded like you were done.

16:13.442 --> 16:15.444
Well, I'm sorry if I was
a little unclear, okay?

16:15.487 --> 16:18.490
I was dealing
with a big disappointment.

16:18.534 --> 16:20.100
So you don't think it'll be
disappointing being a realtor?

16:20.144 --> 16:21.232
I mean, most people
go to those open houses

16:21.276 --> 16:24.235
just to enjoy
warm oatmeal cookies.

16:24.279 --> 16:27.064
Yeah, I-I know
I'll have bad days,

16:27.107 --> 16:29.501
but if somebody doesn't like
a house I show them,

16:29.545 --> 16:33.418
it's not gonna...
you know, whatever.

16:33.462 --> 16:37.683
Hurt. 'Cause you didn't
design the house.

16:37.727 --> 16:40.120
Yeah.

16:40.164 --> 16:44.342
Did you like the portfolio
you sent to Modern Mode?

16:44.386 --> 16:49.086
I loved it.
Best stuff I ever did.

16:49.129 --> 16:52.481
There were these, um,
billowy palazzo pants...

16:52.524 --> 16:54.265
You can skip the details.

16:54.309 --> 16:56.398
[sighs]

16:56.441 --> 16:59.314
And all I got back was,
"Thanks, but no thanks.

16:59.357 --> 17:01.098
"Thanks, but you suck,

17:01.141 --> 17:03.100
"and you're the worst designer
in the world, and we hate you

17:03.143 --> 17:04.884
and everyone hates you
and always will."

17:04.928 --> 17:07.539
Honey, it's just a form letter.

17:09.411 --> 17:12.370
My first media proposal
for Outdoor Man,

17:12.414 --> 17:14.546
I thought I had
all the details right.

17:14.590 --> 17:16.374
Product, price...

17:16.418 --> 17:18.420
You can skip the details.

17:19.595 --> 17:20.900
And it failed?

17:20.944 --> 17:23.294
Nope, huge success.

17:23.338 --> 17:25.688
The truth is, I also had
a lot of epic--

17:25.731 --> 17:27.864
I mean epic-- failures,

17:27.907 --> 17:30.736
I just don't
tell people about those.

17:30.780 --> 17:35.219
I just hate what it feels like
whenever they say "no."

17:35.263 --> 17:37.526
Like I'm worthless.

17:37.569 --> 17:40.006
Maybe because deep down,

17:40.050 --> 17:42.444
you feel like you were put
on this Earth

17:42.487 --> 17:44.968
to be a great designer.

17:45.011 --> 17:49.320
I do. I used to.

17:49.364 --> 17:52.584
I don't know anymore.
[chuckles]

17:52.628 --> 17:54.543
You know, I'm looking
at the stuff you did

17:54.586 --> 17:56.196
when you were a kid.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.763
This is early stuff you did.

17:57.807 --> 18:00.897
Honey, this is really amazing.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.725
Your work is spectacular.

18:02.768 --> 18:05.467
You really think it's good?

18:05.510 --> 18:10.341
I think it's great. But it
doesn't matter what I think.

18:10.385 --> 18:14.171
Or what "Modern Anybody" thinks.

18:14.214 --> 18:16.608
The only person that has
to think it's great

18:16.652 --> 18:19.132
is sitting in your chair
right now.

18:19.176 --> 18:23.398
I just don't know
if I can take it anymore.

18:23.441 --> 18:25.008
This isn't
my first rejection, Dad.

18:25.051 --> 18:28.228
I am sick
of hearing them say "no."

18:28.272 --> 18:31.580
Then you can pack
all this stuff up.

18:31.623 --> 18:34.713
And that's okay. That's okay.

18:34.757 --> 18:37.499
But then, you'll never
experience what it's like

18:37.542 --> 18:41.241
-when they go "yes, yes."
-[laughs softly]

18:41.285 --> 18:45.028
[sniffles]
Just tell me the truth.

18:45.071 --> 18:46.638
Does life get any easier?

18:46.682 --> 18:49.206
No.

18:50.642 --> 18:54.429
But the good news is,
it goes by real quick.

19:01.653 --> 19:04.482
-Hey, honey.
-Hey.

19:04.526 --> 19:06.484
You want to hear
the funniest thing?

19:06.528 --> 19:08.051
Sure.

19:08.094 --> 19:11.402
Did you bring somebody funny
with you?

19:11.446 --> 19:13.404
Hardy har, har, har.
No, listen.

19:13.448 --> 19:16.886
I was at my last student
appointment on Eldora Street,

19:16.929 --> 19:18.757
-in that big Tudor-style house.
-Uh-huh.

19:18.801 --> 19:23.196
So, I was a tutor in a Tudor.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.677
[chuckles]
Get it?

19:25.721 --> 19:28.680
Ha. Top notch, honey.

19:28.724 --> 19:31.683
I made you a special dinner.
Just sit down.

19:31.727 --> 19:33.816
Oh. Just when I think
I can't love you

19:33.859 --> 19:35.687
any more than I do, it happens.

19:35.731 --> 19:37.428
I have that effect on people.

19:38.864 --> 19:41.998
Very awkward at the post office.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.087
-There you go.
Plate's hot, plate's hot.
-Ooh.

19:44.130 --> 19:46.437
Lamb chops.
Wow, they're beautiful.

19:46.481 --> 19:48.091
They were more beautiful
when the other three

19:48.134 --> 19:49.658
were on there, but...

19:51.268 --> 19:54.445
Listen, uh, I had
a little chat with Mandy,

19:54.489 --> 19:56.621
and I think she might be over
that rebound affair

19:56.665 --> 19:58.667
-with real estate.
-Oh, no, you know what?

19:58.710 --> 20:01.147
I feel bad about getting
in her face like that.

20:01.191 --> 20:03.280
I mean, I-I realized
I was just mad at her

20:03.323 --> 20:04.890
for the mistakes
I made in my life.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.458
No, no, I think you've had
a pretty mistake-free life.

20:07.502 --> 20:10.505
Except for the murders.

20:10.548 --> 20:12.550
You know, it's-it's better that

20:12.594 --> 20:14.117
she talks to you
about that stuff.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.379
I mean, y-you're,
you're somebody

20:15.423 --> 20:17.120
who made their dreams come true.

20:17.163 --> 20:18.643
Let's not go into
this again, okay?

20:18.687 --> 20:20.689
-What, you think that's
an insult? No? No?
-No...

20:20.732 --> 20:23.343
All right, well, sure, I got
a couple more. How about this?

20:23.387 --> 20:26.434
You're handsome
and you're good in the sack.

20:27.739 --> 20:29.480
-Oh, really?
-Hmm.

20:29.524 --> 20:30.916
How about this?
You're intelligent

20:30.960 --> 20:32.701
and you have a nice rack.

20:35.181 --> 20:36.574
Now you go.

20:38.576 --> 20:40.709
No, but seriously, seriously,
uh, you know what, honey?

20:40.752 --> 20:43.625
Outdoor Man was your dream,
and you made it come true.

20:43.668 --> 20:45.670
I mean, th-that's
pretty impressive.

20:45.714 --> 20:48.934
More specifically, Outdoor Man
was a goal of mine.

20:48.978 --> 20:50.762
This is my dream.

20:50.806 --> 20:52.634
You, the kids-- us.

20:52.677 --> 20:54.984
And I didn't make
this dream happen.

20:55.027 --> 20:56.768
-We made this happen.
-Mm.

20:56.812 --> 20:58.596
You know, just when I think
I can't love you

20:58.640 --> 21:00.293
any more than I do, it happens.

21:00.337 --> 21:01.643
Well, that's easy to understand.

21:01.686 --> 21:03.775
I'm intelligent
and good in the sack.

21:05.777 --> 21:07.605
And there's nobody
I would rather

21:07.649 --> 21:11.087
have my dreams come true with
than with you, Vanessa Baxter.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.697
Oh, right back at you, mister.

21:12.741 --> 21:15.570
Mm.

21:15.613 --> 21:20.575
So... you want to go upstairs?

21:23.229 --> 21:25.144
I'm eating.

21:26.232 --> 21:28.670
Come on, y-you know.

21:28.713 --> 21:32.630
Yeah, yeah, I do know,
but I'm eating.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.505
That's why they call it a dream.
