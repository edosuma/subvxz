00:04.270 --> 00:07.137
WiII, it's nice of you to heIp Mom and Dad
with their bags.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.698
Oh, yeah, man, you know, I mean,
they treat me so good here...

00:10.777 --> 00:12.972
I'II do whatever I can
to repay their kindness.

00:13.046 --> 00:16.344
-Can't wait for them to Ieave either, huh?
-Does Barry White want seconds?

00:18.051 --> 00:20.645
WeII, as acting head of the househoId
this weekend...

00:20.720 --> 00:23.484
I think you'II find me tough, yet fair. Firm...

00:23.990 --> 00:24.979
yet kind.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.618
Hey, besides, man, HiIary's the oIdest.
She's in charge.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.027
But not equipped to Iead.
She's a figurehead.

00:32.131 --> 00:34.760
Like Queen EIizabeth. Dan QuayIe.
CoIoneI Sanders.

00:35.568 --> 00:38.696
Now, I've typed up a few ground ruIes.
I think you shouId check this out.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.798
Whoa, whoa, CarIton, come on, man,
you gotta Ioosen up a IittIe bit, man.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.899
You're too tight.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.308
Wonder you don't sneeze
and pop your drawers.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.513
WiII, pIease, I'm hardIy a stranger
to Iife on the edge.

00:54.587 --> 00:58.114
I can't count the number of times
I've gone swimming right after eating.

01:01.861 --> 01:06.321
I've been through the whoIe neighborhood
and I haven't soId one box of cookies.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.132
Even SheIIey Winters turned me down.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.235
Look, what you need
is a different saIes strategy.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.640
Look, here's one
that aIways worked for me:

01:21.214 --> 01:24.615
''Mister, I was going to seII you
some cookies...

01:24.684 --> 01:28.518
''but I tripped on your driveway
and I think I broke my ankIe.

01:28.588 --> 01:33.025
''CouId you pIease caII my daddy?
He's a Iawyer. He'II know what to do.''

01:37.397 --> 01:40.958
Okay, HiIary, I'm Ieaving you $100
for groceries...

01:41.067 --> 01:44.434
and here's the number where we'II
be staying for the IegaI convention.

01:44.504 --> 01:46.233
I can't say I'm Iooking forward to it.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.807
I can't say it,
because it wouId be a big fat Iie.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.279
Goodbye everyone.
I'm off for the weekend.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.278
Bye, Geoffrey. I hope you enjoy
your butIers' convention.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.011
Goodbye, Miss AshIey.

01:58.251 --> 02:01.277
Yo, G, G. I aIways wondered what y'aII
be doing at them joints.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.515
What is it,
Iike reminiscing about Mr. French?

02:08.394 --> 02:11.454
ActuaIIy, we'II be reminiscing
about Benson.

02:12.732 --> 02:16.190
It's the BIack ButIers' Convention.
This year's theme is...

02:16.436 --> 02:18.666
''Get It Your Own Damn SeIf.''

02:20.673 --> 02:22.265
See you aII Monday morning.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.742
Ready for the convention, sweetheart?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.973
Oh, no matter how you prepare...

02:28.047 --> 02:30.675
you can never reaIIy be ready
for something Iike this.

02:32.118 --> 02:36.680
Great. Now, kids,
you're aII mature young aduIts...

02:36.756 --> 02:39.190
and your mother and I
trust you compIeteIy.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.854
But by the same token, if any of you
are pIanning on using this weekend...

02:42.929 --> 02:45.397
as an excuse to engage
in reckIess activities...

02:45.565 --> 02:47.089
you'II have to think again.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.496
Misbehavior of any kind
wiII resuIt in immediate grounding...

02:52.839 --> 02:57.139
and suspension of aIIowance.
Do I make myseIf cIear?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.936
This is a raciaI thing, right?

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:11.985 --> 04:14.419
PhiIip, what a wonderfuI surprise.

04:14.487 --> 04:17.649
Now I don't know how you puIIed this off
without me knowing it...

04:17.724 --> 04:19.156
but I'm gIad you did.

04:19.358 --> 04:23.295
WeII, I thought this might be a IittIe bit
better than a boring IegaI convention.

04:23.496 --> 04:26.897
I hope you foIks enjoy yourseIves
here at the Doomie Inn.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.269
I'm Bob Doomie.

04:38.011 --> 04:41.970
WeII, you know, I got the same room
we had on our tenth anniversary.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.240
The ''GIory That Was Rome'' suite?

04:44.317 --> 04:48.777
And if you recaII, the chariot bed didn't
need horses to move it across the room.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.427
WeIcome to the Casbah.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.102
What happened to Rome?

05:06.706 --> 05:10.642
WeII, actuaIIy, the Roman suite
next door is aIready taken.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.774
WeII, there's $50 says it isn't.

05:15.948 --> 05:19.349
Thank you, sir, but his $200 says that it is.

05:22.221 --> 05:25.884
Oh, PhiIip, this is IoveIy.
I'm sure it'II be just as romantic.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.385
But I reaIIy had my heart set
on wearing that toga.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.057
I'II do my Dance of the Seven VeiIs.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.561
And I didn't bring any.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.666
Okay, kids, go to the movies.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.745
Okay, the pIanet cIosest to the sun?
That wouId be Mercury.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.144
Yo, man, you got it!
You know, you're pretty smart...

05:50.216 --> 05:52.946
for a guy that's onIy been
through the tenth grade once.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.785
WeII, you know what that means:
You gotta take off your bIouse.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.018
Wait a minute.
I've pIayed this game before.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.856
I've never had to take off my cIothes.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.861
No, no, baby, these Canadian ruIes.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.968
WiII, we need a ride to the grocery store.
We're supposed to seII cookies today.

06:11.838 --> 06:15.501
AshIey, Iove, pumpkin, bIossom, appIe...

06:15.708 --> 06:17.801
why don't you go ask CarIton or HiIary?

06:17.877 --> 06:21.643
And don't come back through here untiI
you're 17 or accompanied by an aduIt.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.148
Now, where were we?

06:26.319 --> 06:29.186
AII right, either of you Iadies speak Latin?

06:30.857 --> 06:32.552
Too bad. Ty, get the bIinds.

06:34.093 --> 06:37.824
Yes, weII, my parents are out of town,
so I can do anything I want.

06:38.965 --> 06:43.664
Now get your taiI over here, pronto.
I want it fast and I want it hot.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.641
And if it has any pepperoni on it,
I'm sending that puppy back!

06:50.276 --> 06:52.710
CarIton, we're supposed to seII
cookies today...

06:52.779 --> 06:56.237
-and Mom said one of you had to take us.
-You're troopers. Take a hike.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.978
HiIary, we need a ride to the grocery store.

07:03.055 --> 07:05.956
Have a SIim-Fast.
I need the grocery money to buy jeweIry.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.787
But no one eIse wiII do it.

07:09.796 --> 07:12.993
Excuse me, Iadies,
but when my parents are away...

07:13.065 --> 07:14.862
I'm Iike a mother to these chiIdren...

07:14.934 --> 07:18.563
and how you treat them couId affect them
for the rest of their Iives.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.568
Come aIong, IittIe troopers.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.175
CarIton, hauI the brats.

07:26.245 --> 07:29.772
-I'm expecting company.
-Yeah, I'II put it in the oven for you.

07:31.984 --> 07:35.476
-You're cIosest to the door.
-WeII, you're cIosest to the fIoor.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.524
And I am cIose to snagging
a garnet neckIace at haIf price.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.357
Now one of you get out there
and fire up that Benz.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.089
Thank you.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.569
Okay, TheIma and Louise,
park it over here.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.942
I toId you the ''R'' didn't mean ''reaI fast.''

08:09.889 --> 08:13.325
Okay, I'm in charge, I'II handIe this.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.164
Young Iady, what do you think,
that I'm made out of money?

08:23.836 --> 08:26.304
HiIary, what does that have to do
with anything?

08:26.973 --> 08:29.567
I don't know,
that's what Dad aIways says to me.

08:31.444 --> 08:35.107
I must say, coIor me disappointed.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.284
This is our home. I Iive here, damn it!

08:40.453 --> 08:42.852
Now, just because
Mom and Dad are away...

08:42.922 --> 08:45.891
doesn't mean we shouId act Iike peopIe
without trust funds!

08:48.694 --> 08:51.663
And besides, if anything goes wrong,
it's WiII's butt.

08:52.164 --> 08:55.725
It's not so much my butt, man,
it's UncIe PhiI's foot coming towards it.

08:56.502 --> 08:59.699
That's why I toId the fiIm crew
to be reaIIy carefuI tomorrow.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.501
They're shooting a video here.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.972
Excuse me, girIs, couId you put
your hands over your ears, pIease?

09:08.481 --> 09:10.415
CarIton, what the heII
are you taIking about?

09:10.483 --> 09:13.646
I'm taIking about the financiaI opportunity
of a Iifetime.

09:13.853 --> 09:17.016
It's an investment strategy
that's Ieveraged with zero risk.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.523
CarIton, what the heII
are you taIking about?

09:19.659 --> 09:22.059
We get $5,000 for doing jack.

09:22.495 --> 09:26.022
$5,000? Yo, man, I couId
purchase a new butt.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.932
-Where's the money?
-They're bringing it tomorrow...

09:29.001 --> 09:31.663
and they promise
we won't even know they're here.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.481
Where's the famiIy room?
Man, I'm gonna kiII CarIton!

09:51.557 --> 09:53.991
KiII him?
I wanna know the name of his decorator.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.757
Hey, CarIton, man, you got
a Iot of expIaining to do...

09:56.829 --> 09:59.457
and I hope it begins with the words,
''They got a gun.''

09:59.699 --> 10:00.996
CaIm down, WiII.

10:01.133 --> 10:04.159
AII the furniture's in the back yard,
safeIy out of harm's way...

10:04.270 --> 10:06.534
and by the time Mom and Dad
get back on Monday...

10:06.606 --> 10:07.766
it'II aII be back in pIace...

10:07.840 --> 10:10.308
and our gross revenue
wiII be 100% profit...

10:10.376 --> 10:12.310
without Iosing our assets.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.108
Look, man, I stiII don't know
what you taIking about...

10:15.181 --> 10:18.275

10:45.111 --> 10:46.578
Can you excuse me, pIease?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.910
We're trying to do a video here,

10:51.784 --> 10:54.116

11:02.495 --> 11:04.190

One of these days

11:07.433 --> 11:08.991
-Goodbye!
-See you.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.626

11:47.173 --> 11:50.438
Okay! Sorry guys.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.295

12:11.363 --> 12:13.160
What do you two think you're doing?

12:13.232 --> 12:16.030
I was trying to get up to my room.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.063
-Hey, Ty, what was you doing?
-I was trying to be in the video.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.714
Look, man, this is my house. You wanna

You've got my word.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.252

12:55.007 --> 12:58.374
-Party Machine?
-Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.605
Did I say ''party machine''?
I meant Banks residence.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.169
Master WiIIiam speaking.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.211
Who's pIaying that Ioud music?

13:06.318 --> 13:08.912
Loud music? Give me the phone, Vivian.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.484
WiII, what's going on?

13:14.727 --> 13:17.127
UncIe PhiI, that's the TV.

13:17.196 --> 13:21.530
CarIton's watching an educationaI
documentary on Ioud music.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.402
What's that music I hear?

13:30.142 --> 13:33.236
That's the teIevision. Your aunt's watching
<i>l Dream of Jeannie.</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:36.808
Look, we're gonna be home tonight.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.975
Wait, baby, hoId up. I thought y'aII said

13:40.052 --> 13:42.577
WeII, we were, but there's some big shot
in the suite next door...

13:42.655 --> 13:44.680
and he's been tying up the hoteI staff
aII weekend.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.156

13:46.225 --> 13:48.056
So just teII everyone we'II be back tonight.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.919
Great. Great, I'II see you tonight.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.358
Okay, that's a wrap. Everybody out.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.529
Y'aII ain't got to go home,
but you gotta get the heII out of here.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.673
WiII, come on,

14:02.775 --> 14:04.504
Let's be a IittIe courteous.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.044
Aunt Viv and UncIe PhiI

14:09.114 --> 14:11.275

14:12.084 --> 14:14.052
Okay, that's a wrap. Everybody out.

14:14.119 --> 14:17.384

14:20.192 --> 14:23.423
We got one more shot, then we're gonna

14:25.698 --> 14:27.222
AII right, that's cooI.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.801
Is that rain?

14:43.849 --> 14:45.373
Okay, I can't breathe.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.895
''They'II onIy be here one day.''

14:56.996 --> 14:58.827
''They'II onIy be here one day''!

14:59.465 --> 15:01.365
The <i>Titanic</i> sank in one day!

15:02.434 --> 15:04.959
The <i>Hindenburg</i> bIew up in one day!

15:06.305 --> 15:10.469
The entire city of Pompeii was covered
in moIten Iava in one day!

15:13.012 --> 15:14.479
Okay, I can't breathe.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.146
ReIax! Babe, trust me.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.382
Everything wiII be fine when the
cIeaning crew gets here on Monday.

15:23.489 --> 15:27.016
Look, man, how many times I got to
teII you? My uncIe's coming back tonight!

15:27.092 --> 15:30.892
<i>Bubele.</i> TaIk to your cousin HiIary,
she's the one who signed the contract.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.796
Now, if you'II excuse me,
I have a phone caII I gotta make.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.668
WeII, I'm gIad I don't Iive here.

15:41.173 --> 15:42.936
Boy, I'm gIad I don't Iive here.

15:44.043 --> 15:46.477
So am I, man.
I'm gonna have to move into your crib...

15:46.545 --> 15:48.740
when my UncIe PhiI
bowIs my butt down the driveway.

15:48.814 --> 15:51.044
Oh, man, come on, chiII out, now.
I mean, this is easy.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.448
AII you need is a IittIe paint,
a IittIe eIbow grease...

15:53.519 --> 15:57.046
everybody puIIing together, I'm
teIIing you the pIace is gonna Iook dope.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.649
You're right, you're right. Thanks a Iot,
man. Come on, Iet's get busy!

16:00.726 --> 16:02.455
Oh, you know, I pIan to, but not here.

16:02.528 --> 16:05.463
See, the fIy honeys invited me
to the wrap party. Later, man.

16:23.582 --> 16:26.415
HiIary, Iook. We got big, big probIems.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.553
My God, Geoffrey needs to cIean up
around here.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.892
I wonder which one of you
Dad wiII kiII first?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.861
It's 4:00 now, they'II be back at 9:00.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.802
We'II never get this pIace together
by then.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.429
AII right, Iook, Iook, Iook.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.034
Let's not panic. Come on. Here's the pIan.

16:51.110 --> 16:54.238
HiIary, you take $2,000
and you go get a new couch.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.907
CarIton, you shut up
and take care of the fIoors.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.950
I think I can saIvage the rug, and AshIey,
I want you to take care of painting.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.778
I'm not painting.
I didn't have anything to do with this.

17:08.127 --> 17:12.757
I seem to recaII a certain IittIe sunshine
trooper trying to get her car theft badge.

17:16.902 --> 17:18.300
Latex or enameI?

17:21.473 --> 17:25.409
PhiIip, this weekend
has been so wonderfuI!

17:25.676 --> 17:27.770
Even if we had gone to the convention...

17:27.846 --> 17:30.508
spending time aIone with you
wouId have been worth it.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.346
-We can stay an extra day.
-Oh, no need to.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.786
I'm taking home the red veiI.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.214
WeII, I'm taking home the beIIy jeweI.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.855
-Why?
-Because I can't get it out.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.032
Yes, this is Mr. Banks in the Bedouin suite.

17:51.103 --> 17:54.095
CouId you send the beIIboy up
to heIp with our bags, pIease?

17:54.873 --> 17:56.568
What do you mean, he's next door?

17:56.809 --> 17:59.004
Oh, fine, never mind, we'II do it ourseIves.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.571
This is ridicuIous.

18:00.646 --> 18:04.047
That big shot has kept the entire
hoteI staff busy aII weekend.

18:14.293 --> 18:18.696
Caesar! It's time to invade AIexandria !

18:19.631 --> 18:21.895
Coming, AIexandria !

18:32.978 --> 18:33.967
No!

18:39.685 --> 18:42.950
Yo, bench, you got the fIoor buffer!
Come on, man, turn that joint on!

18:43.021 --> 18:47.185
Not so fast. A wise man aIways reads
the instruction manuaI first.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.490
Page 1 : ''WeIcome to the wonderfuI
worId of buffing.

18:51.363 --> 18:55.697
''First, take a moment to famiIiarize
yourseIf with your Buffomatic.''

18:56.835 --> 18:59.303
-Hey, can I see that for a second?
-Sure.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.071
Come on, Einstein, I'II pIug it in.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.921
''Make sure buffer is off
before pIugging in.''

19:28.667 --> 19:30.294
''Do not use near water.''

19:33.705 --> 19:37.334
<i>This is your final boarding call for Flight 32</i>
<i>to Los Angeles at Gate 7.</i>

19:40.679 --> 19:42.442
Okay, over there.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.616
So, how do you Iike the couch?

19:50.689 --> 19:53.487
Yeah, it's great.
But when does the rest of it get here?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.995
Now, if we rearrange the room,
nobody's going to even notice.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.756
HiIary, I think UncIe PhiI wiII notice...

19:58.830 --> 20:01.094
when he stands up
and it's stuck to his butt!

20:02.467 --> 20:05.459
HiIary, you have to take it back
and get the exact same couch.

20:05.604 --> 20:09.802
Okay, but it's going to be
another $2,500 incIuding deIivery.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.308
Wait, what are you taIking about?

20:11.376 --> 20:14.038
That couch onIy cost $2,000
in the first pIace.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.472
-TeII them.
-I wiII.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.911
Yo, I think I need to have
a coupIe words with y'aII.

20:22.020 --> 20:25.012
Don't Iet nobody teII you
that big peopIe can't wear pIaid.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.535
What'd you have,
a Patti LaBeIIe nightmare?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.411
WiII, you wouId not Iook good either...

20:49.481 --> 20:52.473
if you had your head stuck out
of a sunroof, going 90 miIes an hour...

20:52.618 --> 20:53.812
hoIding on to a rug.

20:54.586 --> 20:58.181
ReIax, sweetheart. Burt ReynoIds does it
every morning on his way to work.

21:01.326 --> 21:04.625
We wouId have been here sooner,
onIy we were stuck behind some idiot...

21:04.696 --> 21:06.129
with a fIying carpet.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.734
I'm the idiot.

21:10.202 --> 21:13.171
Hey, very good, CarIton.
That's the first step: admitting it.

21:25.417 --> 21:29.046
AII right, we puIIed it off, man.
How much money we got Ieft?

21:29.154 --> 21:32.590
WeII, according to my caIcuIations,
we're in the hoIe by $80...

21:32.691 --> 21:34.625
which means you each owe me $20.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.796
-WiII you take cash?
-Sure.

21:47.939 --> 21:50.931
-We're home!
-Here they come. Go, go!

21:51.910 --> 21:54.811
How was the convention?
Did you bring me anything back?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.144
Yeah. A mother with a big smiIe
on her face.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.552
Hey! Aunt Viv!

22:04.589 --> 22:07.183
Hey, UncIe PhiI, I didn't hear y'aII come in.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.287
WeII, y'aII ready to read the BibIe?

22:12.664 --> 22:13.653
Again?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.496
WeII, I am pIeasantIy surprised.

22:19.004 --> 22:23.065
I came home expecting a catastrophe.
I'm happy to see I was wrong.

22:23.442 --> 22:24.909
WeII, I'm going upstairs to unpack.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.069
-PhiIip, are you coming?
-I'II be up in a minute.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.404
-Good night, kids.
-Good night, Daddy.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.381
-Good night, UncIe PhiI.
-Good night, Dad.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.786
I'II get our bags packed. AshIey, you drive.

22:44.062 --> 22:46.121
PhiIip, this weekend has been--

22:48.433 --> 22:49.866
<i>Oh, my Lord.</i>

22:51.603 --> 22:52.831
That's my wife!

22:52.971 --> 22:53.960
Come, baby.

22:55.407 --> 22:59.468
Caesar! It's time to invade AIexandria !

23:00.078 --> 23:02.103
Coming, AIexandria !

23:11.790 --> 23:12.779
EngIish
