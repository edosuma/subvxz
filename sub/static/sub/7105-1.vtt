02:48.868 --> 02:50.802
- Galleycat?
- Gawker.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.772
- Slut.
- He's been out twice already.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.107
Thanks.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.283
Jack Bauman's office.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.785
Oh, hi, Morgan.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.388
Yeah, I'm sure he did read them.
Um, I did.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.323
I thought it was amazing work.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.991
So glad you could make it.

03:12.993 --> 03:16.495
If you've got a minute,
let's go through my day.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.131
- You know, I'm sure that he
would love to talk to you,

03:19.133 --> 03:21.266
uh, but he's in a meeting
right now.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.368
- And don't forget
to change my shrink appointment.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.370
Got it.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.907
- Oh, um, I need you to manage
another release for me.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.509
- There's nothing
scheduled for months.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.311
- It's for the e-book
of "waking eyes. "

03:32.313 --> 03:34.213
We're tying in
the new edition.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.550
- I thought that was
coming out next fall.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.385
- A spot opened up
on "Charlie rose. "

03:40.387 --> 03:41.954
We're moving it up.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.488
Oh.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.891
- I thought you'd be
the perfect person for the job.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.259
What?

03:47.261 --> 03:50.562
- Well, your father
is Milan's agent, right?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.864
- Yeah, but...
- they sent me the arcs.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.902
Get a list from publicity.
Let's put our heads together.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.840
Alice?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.242
All right, look,
I know it's not glamorous,

04:03.244 --> 04:05.043
but I'm putting
my trust in you.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.680
"Waking eyes" is the best seller
on our backlist.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.950
All right, all right, look,

04:11.952 --> 04:14.553
what if... what if
I read that manuscript

04:14.555 --> 04:17.555
you've been
hounding me about, hmm?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.458
- You will?
- Yeah, what's the girl's name?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.093
- Karen Malone.
- Yeah, Karen.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.161
- Malone.
- Okay.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.896
- It's the best thing that
I've read since I've been here.

04:24.898 --> 04:25.931
I said I'd read it.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.232
Okay, but we have to hurry

04:27.234 --> 04:28.934
because there might be
some interest...

04:28.936 --> 04:30.269
- yes, Alan Mitchell,
please.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.870
He's busy?
Ah. Well, fuck him.

04:31.872 --> 04:35.974
No, I don't want
to leave a message.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.577
- So you'll read
the manuscript this week?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.646
Yes.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.335
Hey.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.437
You're doing
the "waking eyes" release?

05:05.439 --> 05:07.272
- Did you know
they were moving it up?

05:07.274 --> 05:09.374
Yeah.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.144
That's the book
that made me love books.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.112
I totally identified
with her.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.181
Didn't you?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.551
Alice?

05:29.295 --> 05:31.430
- Well, these are friends
of my wife.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.664
Nice to meet you.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.500
- They've just
come over from some...

05:37.705 --> 05:39.604
Hey, sport.

05:39.606 --> 05:40.706
You having a good time?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.407
- Sure.
- Say hi to everyone.

05:42.409 --> 05:43.975
Hi.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.478
- Alice wrote a terrific
short story last week.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.548
She's gonna be
the real deal.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.084
Oh, this is Milan Daneker.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.686
This is my daughter, Alice.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.054
Hi.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.256
- It's a pleasure
to meet you.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.325
- Milan is one of your mother's
undiscovered writers,

06:00.327 --> 06:02.394
but he's written
a book, a good book,

06:02.396 --> 06:04.229
and I'm going
to make sure it sells.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.131
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.669
You got to meet Annette...

06:10.671 --> 06:12.704
- All right.
- "Times book review. "

06:12.706 --> 06:16.408
Lay a little
of that foreign charm on her.

06:18.344 --> 06:21.580
<I>- "She dodged
the forced laughter

06:21.582 --> 06:24.616
<I>and the vapid conversations. "

06:26.619 --> 06:28.387
<I>"If she could just"...

06:28.389 --> 06:29.621
oh, sorry.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.059
I-I was just looking around,
and, um...

06:34.061 --> 06:35.360
It's okay.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.063
Can I?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.132
Really?

06:48.074 --> 06:51.009
So how is it to grow up
like this?

06:51.011 --> 06:53.078
Uh...

06:53.080 --> 06:54.479
It's a little lonely.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.681
That's what I thought, yes.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.750
Yeah.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.521
And you're
a writer too, yes?

07:02.523 --> 07:05.223
Um...

07:05.225 --> 07:07.559
I don't know.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.162
- I would like
to read your story.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.665
It's nothing.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.235
- Why don't you
let me decide?

07:23.277 --> 07:25.343
Well, I-I must...

07:26.746 --> 07:28.580
okay.

07:42.328 --> 07:45.397
<I>- "If she could just make
herself small enough"...

07:48.100 --> 07:51.169
<I>"Completely unremarkable"...

08:16.363 --> 08:17.496
Hi. Sorry.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.564
- Here she is,
late as usual.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.366
Mwah.

08:21.368 --> 08:24.769
We were just discussing
this new film with, um...

08:24.771 --> 08:26.404
What's his name?

08:26.406 --> 08:27.806
Flavor of the month...
you know who I mean.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.375
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Have you seen it?

08:30.377 --> 08:32.510
- Yeah, Sadie and I went to see
it last weekend, actually.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.212
Mm-hmm.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.282
And?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.351
We... we kind of enjoyed it.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.186
- I thought
you were smarter than that.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.388
Did you know Alice
won a scholastic writing award

08:43.390 --> 08:44.723
when she was 16?

08:44.725 --> 08:47.526
- Really?
- We'd like to order now.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.793
What'll you have, sport?

08:48.795 --> 08:50.395
Oh, get the beef cheeks.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.663
They're fabulous here.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.365
She'll have the beef cheeks.
And you?

08:53.367 --> 08:54.499
Pasta puttanesca.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.767
- Oh, I'll have
the puttanesca.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.169
You have
the grilled chicken. Maya?

08:58.171 --> 09:00.205
- She'll have
the grilled cheese.

09:00.207 --> 09:04.342
- No, no,
a half order of calamari

09:04.344 --> 09:06.878
and some fries for her.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.147
Yeah.
Make it a whole order.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.448
Kids love fried stuff.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.551
Here's to you, pal.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.653
- Oh.
What are we celebrating?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.888
- Independent booksellers
love the book.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.457
Word of mouth is fantastic.
- Thank you.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.893
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.798
- Oh, I love
watching you eat.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.401
- I know, I know.
- You must.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.869
You invite him to dinner
every night.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.204
Anna.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.372
That looks great.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.907
So here's to me.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.477
I discover talented writers,
develop them for years,

09:39.479 --> 09:41.546
and then you steal them
away from me.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.949
- Anna, you told me to get
a new agent.

09:43.951 --> 09:47.552
- We're getting some great press
in the trades.

09:47.554 --> 09:51.456
Milan is making headway
on the next one, right?

09:51.458 --> 09:52.857
- Mm.
- Right?

09:52.859 --> 09:56.428
- Yes.
- I'm talking to you.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.296
You're drunk.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.465
Fuck you.

10:00.467 --> 10:04.736
- Your command of the English
language is astonishing.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.705
Fuck you.

10:06.707 --> 10:10.575
- I think
you said that already.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.845
- Cursing was one of the first
words I knew in English.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.947
- Really?
Who taught you?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.817
The kid next door.

10:18.819 --> 10:22.354
- Excuse me.
I'm going to go freshen up.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.659
- Delicious, huh?
Mmm.

10:27.661 --> 10:31.663
- Delicious.
- Mmm, mmm.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.698
How's yours?

11:15.541 --> 11:17.909
Come over here.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.467
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.436
I'm here to see Jack Bauman.

11:44.438 --> 11:48.673
- Oh, yes. Go right in.
- Okay, thank you.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.011
Oh, shit.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.754
Oh, my god, look at you.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.823
Hey.

12:08.761 --> 12:12.363
- Uh, what are you
doing here?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.899
- I just finished my first draft
of my new book,

12:14.901 --> 12:16.935
so I'm here to deliver it.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.703
- What, are you kidding?
We would've sent someone.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.371
- It's better in person,
isn't it?

12:20.373 --> 12:21.439
Congratulations.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.907
Finally,
something worth reading.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.010
- Thank you.
- Come into my office.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.646
It's been far too long.

12:31.016 --> 12:34.519
- Hey, where'd you go?
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.694
- So is it done?
- Finally.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.830
Great.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.621
Alice, where's my lunch?

13:09.623 --> 13:12.757
- Oh, uh,
Chez Louis, 1:00 P.M.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.826
- If I'd known
you were gonna drop by...

13:14.828 --> 13:17.996
- But maybe I could have lunch
with Alice.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.699
- What?
- To celebrate.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.002
- I... actually, I can't.
I've got...

13:24.004 --> 13:26.104
- you have to eat.
- I really need...

13:26.106 --> 13:27.672
- you could toss around
some marketing ideas.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.107
- I... you know what?
Um...

13:29.109 --> 13:30.875
She'd love to.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.480
Please?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.600
How are you?

13:55.602 --> 13:56.634
Good, good.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.469
Good, good.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.839
Good.

14:03.075 --> 14:07.545
So you're organizing the release
of the new edition, yes?

14:07.547 --> 14:10.648
Ironic, huh?

14:10.650 --> 14:13.484
It's nice.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.220
Tell me about your day.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.622
Uh...

14:17.624 --> 14:20.658
You know...
School.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.628
How was yours?

14:23.630 --> 14:27.098
You know, writing.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.133
I'm glad you could meet me.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.702
Thank you very much.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.570
When can I read your story?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.039
It's, like, no big deal.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.575
They, um...
they just printed it

14:37.577 --> 14:39.611
'cause no one
really submits stuff,

14:39.613 --> 14:41.880
and, um...

14:41.882 --> 14:44.482
Um, they're
kind of desperate.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.051
Come on.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.504
This line here

15:06.506 --> 15:09.941
is exactly
how it feels like

15:09.943 --> 15:13.211
the first time you see someone
that you maybe love.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.780
It's, uh...

15:15.782 --> 15:17.849
You're a writer.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.856
What about your writing?

15:24.858 --> 15:26.090
I'm mostly not.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.060
That's a shame.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.765
I read your new bio.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.767
It says that
you're teaching a lot.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.036
Yes, I enjoy it.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.571
I'm sure.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.809
- You were my first
and best student.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.578
I got to go.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.949
Alice, I've missed you.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.229
- Why don't you just say,
"hey, about that little thing

16:05.231 --> 16:07.966
"that happened 15 years ago
that you never owned up to

16:07.968 --> 16:09.133
"or apologized for
like you should have,

16:09.135 --> 16:11.302
you motherfucker"...
sorry, Tyler.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.937
- Okay, I should never
have told you.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.939
Look, it's not a big deal.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.808
But he hurt you, Ali.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.310
You don't do publicity
for someone who hurt you.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.878
It's my job.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.580
- I thought your job
was to help find and edit

16:22.582 --> 16:24.182
new and wonderful novels.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.918
- Tell that to Jack.
- Why don't you?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.653
Will you help me?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.888
- Besides the fact that I think
it's a terrible idea,

16:30.890 --> 16:32.223
what could I do?

16:32.225 --> 16:34.726
- You're a successful
web designer.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.361
Alice.

16:36.363 --> 16:40.264
- Okay, fine. You're
a semi-successful web designer

16:40.266 --> 16:43.067
whose best friend
thinks she's brilliant.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.303
- Yeah, who gave up
her not-so-stellar career

16:45.305 --> 16:47.071
to be a mommy.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.640
- I need to build more
of a web presence for the book.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.809
Oh, that's a great idea.

16:51.811 --> 16:55.913
- Sadie, please,
don't make me do this alone.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.752
- You're a real shit,
you know that?

17:00.754 --> 17:03.955
Thank you.

17:03.957 --> 17:07.191
All right, I need to go
and wrangle a radio spot.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.192
Yay.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.794
We didn't get to talk

17:09.796 --> 17:11.194
about what you want to do
for your birthday.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.797
- Hide in a closet
until it's over.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.098
- You better have
a big closet.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.299
You promised.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.334
Come here, buddy.
Give me a hug.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.403
I got to go. Hugs.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.070
Alice, why are you always

17:20.073 --> 17:21.271
running off somewhere
you don't want to go?

17:21.273 --> 17:22.874
Oh, fuck off.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.175
Sorry, Tyler.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.878
All right.
- Bye. Call me later.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.982
I will.

17:30.984 --> 17:33.051
You want some?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.981
Hello?

18:05.884 --> 18:08.019
"It was a graceful
pas de deux,

18:08.021 --> 18:09.987
"a dance of hate.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.956
"He belittles her,
two, three.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.827
She yells, two, three. "

18:49.262 --> 18:51.762
<I>Hello?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.164
It's me.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.367
This is the new story.

18:56.369 --> 19:00.004
So, uh, I'm not really sure
about the ending.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.439
It feels really forced,

19:01.441 --> 19:06.377
and to me, the dialogue
is really bogus.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.446
So...

19:11.016 --> 19:12.450
Do you have a pen?

19:12.452 --> 19:15.520
Yeah.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.588
Thanks.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.226
I can't watch.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.906
Is that your homework?

19:34.908 --> 19:38.342
- Uh, yeah. I have, like,
100 pages of American history.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.443
Come over here, kiddo.

19:39.445 --> 19:41.946
Come, let's read together.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.883
It's good.
- You made notes all over it.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.253
- I wouldn't bother
if it wasn't good.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.388
But it can be better.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.856
It's too abstract.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.159
It's, um...

20:28.161 --> 20:31.996
So it only becomes real...

20:31.998 --> 20:33.564
If you give it
concrete details,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.166
concrete details.

20:35.168 --> 20:36.934
Look, here.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.136
It's too abstract.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.007
If you move that one...

20:45.344 --> 20:47.144
Here we go.

20:47.146 --> 20:52.083
- Okay, so who has material
to hand out for next class?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.451
- I need one more
volunteer.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.119
I brought in some new pages.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.622
Um, Alice?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.290
- I had this really
radical idea

20:59.292 --> 21:01.325
for this super weapon
the Xorgots are gonna use

21:01.327 --> 21:03.194
to destroy planet earth.
Just wait till you...

21:03.196 --> 21:04.528
- it doesn't have
to be complete.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.465
Maybe we could give
you some... some ideas or...

21:07.467 --> 21:10.201
- Well,
if she doesn't have anything...

21:10.203 --> 21:13.471
I'm sorry.

21:13.473 --> 21:17.541
- Okay, Josh,
what are those aliens up to?

21:26.151 --> 21:27.652
Oh, my...

21:27.654 --> 21:31.222
look at that view.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.324
It's beautiful.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.393
It's, um...

21:41.400 --> 21:43.467
Come.

21:47.539 --> 21:50.908
So tell me
about your day.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.577
Um...

21:53.579 --> 21:54.945
School.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.914
School?

21:56.916 --> 22:00.117
- Uh, it's the same every day...
totally boring.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.386
- Oh, not for me. You know,
for me, it's like a movie...

22:02.388 --> 22:05.990
cheerleaders, boys
in team jackets, holding hands.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.658
- No.
- No?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.093
Mm-mm.

22:09.095 --> 22:12.029
Um, people
don't hold hands anymore.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.931
They just hook up.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.399
- They hook up?
- Mm-hmm.

22:15.401 --> 22:18.135
They hook up.

22:18.137 --> 22:21.472
- And, uh,
no cheerleaders.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.709
No, wait.
I guess we do have uniforms.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.711
- Uniforms?
- Mm-hmm.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.113
Yeah, yeah.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.315
- My best friend, Ruby,
just went Goth.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.017
- She turned what?
- Goth.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.685
- Goth?
- Mm-hmm.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.220
- Goth?
- Uh-huh.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.688
Well, what...

22:37.690 --> 22:40.691
- you know, like, uh...
like, uh, black eyeliner

22:40.693 --> 22:42.993
and ripped shirts.
- Oh, yeah?

22:42.995 --> 22:45.396
- And, uh, her mom would
freak out if she knew,

22:45.398 --> 22:48.632
so, she, um... she hides her stuff
in the hallway every day

22:48.634 --> 22:49.734
before she leaves.
- Uh-huh.

22:49.736 --> 22:54.071
- And, uh, um...
- Yeah?

22:54.073 --> 22:56.707
Um...

22:56.709 --> 22:59.143
Uh...
- And, yeah?

22:59.145 --> 23:01.212
- You... you want to hear
about this?

23:01.214 --> 23:02.980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

23:02.982 --> 23:07.385
- Um, well, she says her mom
has no idea who she is anymore,

23:07.387 --> 23:09.587
but maybe she never did.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.655
Yeah.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.597
So Thursday's a good day
for you?

23:19.599 --> 23:21.298
- I guess so.
- Okay.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.235
See you next Thursday, then.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.176
I'm sorry, guys.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.446
I know you're wasting
precious babysitter time.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.682
I just want to eat
in front of the TV

23:38.684 --> 23:40.751
and get sodden and pathetic.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.587
- It is your day.
We will do whatever you want.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.089
Thank you.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.295
Together:
Surprise!

23:54.065 --> 23:57.468
- I knew you were gonna
make us bring you home.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.671
- Thank you. Aww.
I'm going to kill you.

24:00.673 --> 24:04.241
Happy birthday.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.477
You're really going to enjoy it
once you get used to the idea.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.412
- Come on.
- Come on, help her blow it out.

24:08.414 --> 24:11.816
One, two, three.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.552
- Ooh, a little bit more.
Oh, oh. Yay.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.153
One more, one more.
- Last one.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.691
Whoo!

24:55.193 --> 24:57.261
What?

25:00.866 --> 25:03.200
What you writing?

25:03.202 --> 25:05.269
My journal.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.306
Come on.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.543
Mm-mm.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.612
I want to know you.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.748
I can't.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.817
One page.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.642
Okay.

26:01.593 --> 26:05.429
My heart is pounding.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.665
I have to get up.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.733
I have to get up.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.305
A kiss.

26:23.815 --> 26:25.883
A real one.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.492
- Oh, sorry.
- No, that's okay.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.595
I was just...
I was reading.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.663
Sorry. Do you need...
- no, no.

26:39.665 --> 26:43.267
I-I was just looking
for a place to hide out.

26:48.974 --> 26:50.674
My friend invited me.

26:50.676 --> 26:54.578
I don't even know the girl
who this is for.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.980
Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.881
- Well, happy birthday.
- Shh.

26:57.883 --> 27:01.485
I'm trying to pretend
like I don't have to grow up.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.923
- Is there anything
I can do to help?

27:05.925 --> 27:07.992
Maybe.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.731
Yeah.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.799
Looks good.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.709
So what are you reading?

27:27.345 --> 27:28.679
Oh.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.581
I love that character.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.516
The female Holden Caulfield.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.319
- Yeah,
that's what they say.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.454
Not a favorite?

27:37.456 --> 27:39.623
No.

27:39.625 --> 27:44.294
- So why are you
sitting alone

27:44.296 --> 27:46.830
in a bathroom
on your birthday reading it?

27:49.035 --> 27:51.268
Work.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.703
What do you do?

27:52.705 --> 27:55.706
- That is not
an age-appropriate question.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.541
- You're right.
I'm sorry.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.482
Want some?

28:05.484 --> 28:07.384
Definitely.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.928
Alice.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.368
Oh, Emmett.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.437
Hi.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.342
Hey.

28:34.447 --> 28:36.480
What?

28:38.517 --> 28:41.919
- You were right.
I did have a good time.

28:41.921 --> 28:45.322
I'm glad.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.057
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.726
Thanks for inviting me.

28:48.728 --> 28:49.993
Yeah.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.096
- Wait. You two
know each other?

28:52.098 --> 28:54.531
- Uh, he was rob's
freshman year roommate,

28:54.533 --> 28:57.000
but I actually met him first...

28:57.002 --> 28:58.836
Freshman mixer.

28:58.838 --> 28:59.970
Oh, right.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.406
- You're kidding.
- No.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.874
Okay. College, wow.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.709
Let me help you up.
- Thank you.

29:05.711 --> 29:08.679
Can I help with the cleanup?

29:08.681 --> 29:10.547
No, no, no.

29:10.549 --> 29:13.484
We got this.
You've done enough.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.555
You recycle?

29:18.557 --> 29:21.625
Uh, I plead the fifth.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.431
What about your mom?

29:27.433 --> 29:29.433
She stayed home with us.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.934
Do you have sponges?

29:30.936 --> 29:33.103
Uh, uh...

29:33.105 --> 29:35.606
Sorry.

29:35.608 --> 29:39.443
- Yeah, they've been married
35 years,

29:39.445 --> 29:43.847
sometimes happily,
sometimes not.

29:43.849 --> 29:48.118
They're abnormally normal.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.889
- Wow. You're, like, some kind
of almost extinct species.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.792
They should breed
you in captivity.

29:58.630 --> 30:03.801
- So, aside from not being
environmental activists,

30:03.803 --> 30:07.104
what's your family like?

30:07.106 --> 30:09.606
Um...

30:09.608 --> 30:11.975
Not much like a family,

30:11.977 --> 30:14.044
I guess.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.048
And?

30:18.050 --> 30:20.117
Nuts.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.886
Oh, that explains it.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.190
Thanks.

30:26.192 --> 30:29.092
- Look,
just so we're clear,

30:29.094 --> 30:31.929
I don't really do nuts.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.865
I'll keep that in mind.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.605
Hey.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.139
Hey.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.876
Hey.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.778
How do you take your coffee?

31:21.780 --> 31:23.747
Black.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.816
Okay.

31:29.087 --> 31:31.088
I'll call you later?

31:52.110 --> 31:55.045
- So, while he was building
a bionicle,

31:55.047 --> 31:59.750
I posted on New Yorker books,
Paris review, Galleycat.

31:59.752 --> 32:02.819
Uh, what else?
- How am I gonna thank you?

32:02.821 --> 32:05.589
- Oh, I don't know.
Foot massage?

32:07.892 --> 32:10.761
Not too high, Ty.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.901
- So Alice grew up
and became

32:17.903 --> 32:20.971
a wife and mother
just like everybody else.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.608
Isn't that sad?

32:26.077 --> 32:28.145
Yeah.

32:28.147 --> 32:31.815
But it would make me sadder
if she hadn't.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.617
Your face is chapped.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.285
When you're near 30,
you have to moisturize.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.220
Trust me.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.288
Kissing.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.923
What?

32:39.925 --> 32:42.192
Too much kissing.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.661
- Never say that
to a married person.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.042
Emmett.
- Yeah, I guessed.

33:00.011 --> 33:03.714
Look at you.
- What?

33:03.716 --> 33:06.717
I'm so glad.

33:06.719 --> 33:09.219
- It's terrifying.
- And exhilarating.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.922
- Mom?
- What is it, baby?

33:11.924 --> 33:13.790
- Jesus Christ.
- Mom?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.859
Okay.

33:38.383 --> 33:40.017
- Alice.
- Dad.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.219
- I forgot I need a jacket
for this thing tonight.

33:42.221 --> 33:45.122
Here, this was in the middle
of the living room.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.857
It's not mine.

33:46.859 --> 33:49.893
- Well, where the hell
did it come from?

33:49.895 --> 33:52.362
God, it reeks.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.898
I think it's Milan's.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.967
Milan's?

33:58.803 --> 34:01.805
- He was here
this afternoon.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.874
- Did he bring by
a new draft?

34:06.377 --> 34:09.713
- He, uh...
he came to see me.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.281
You?

34:11.283 --> 34:12.783
Yeah.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.351
He's been helping me
with my writing.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.420
- What?
Wha...

34:19.157 --> 34:21.091
since when?

34:21.092 --> 34:23.159
A while.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.097
Well...

34:27.099 --> 34:30.867
You couldn't have
a better mentor.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.036
You're a lucky girl.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.672
Yeah.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.873
- I expect great things
of you.

34:41.344 --> 34:43.914
Good night.

34:47.784 --> 34:49.252
Okay, here.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.389
So this lady,
she hasn't voted in 20 years.

34:52.391 --> 34:55.158
She starts reading our most
outrageous quotes of the day,

34:55.159 --> 34:57.060
sees her senator waxing poetic

34:57.062 --> 35:00.130
about the benefits
of hydrofracking.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.099
Immediately promises
to volunteer

35:02.101 --> 35:04.434
for anyone
who will run against him.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.771
- Wow.
- And this guy... oh, my god.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.706
I love the way
they curse in the south.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.375
- You do realize
you're a fanatic, don't you?

35:12.377 --> 35:16.046
- Yeah, sorry.
- Mm.

35:22.487 --> 35:26.089
- You, uh... you want some
of my pakora?

35:26.091 --> 35:29.259
- Yes, I want to try
your pakoras.

35:29.261 --> 35:33.363
- I approved your entry,
so you can post it anytime.

35:33.365 --> 35:37.200
I'm the last one here,
so I'm gonna head out.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.435
See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.004
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.474
- It's nice to know
somebody

35:44.476 --> 35:47.043
who actually likes
what they do.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.980
I always wanted to be a writer
when I grew up.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.015
Are you?

35:52.017 --> 35:53.316
Grown up?

35:53.318 --> 35:55.986
No, writing.

35:58.756 --> 36:01.091
No.

36:01.093 --> 36:03.160
How come?

36:04.529 --> 36:07.531
- I sit there waiting to hear
the characters speak,

36:07.533 --> 36:09.766
and instead,
I have this voice in my head,

36:09.768 --> 36:14.004
saying, "this is shit.
This is shit. This is shit. "

36:14.006 --> 36:16.273
Come on, that voice?

36:16.275 --> 36:17.941
Everybody hears that voice.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.910
It's the same voice
that says,

36:19.912 --> 36:23.914
"I can't believe you just said
that, you fucking moron. "

36:23.916 --> 36:26.183
Everybody hears that voice.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.317
You think?

36:27.319 --> 36:29.219
Yeah.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.922
Most people just ignore it.

36:31.924 --> 36:35.292
- Really?
I just...

36:35.294 --> 36:38.195
Succumb.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.463
Yeah?

36:40.465 --> 36:44.901
I like a girl
who knows how to succumb.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.136
Really?

36:46.138 --> 36:47.170
Really.

37:06.325 --> 37:10.927
Shit.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.359
Ah.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.261
Well, good morning.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.495
This the new jacket copy?
- Yeah.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.930
- Great.
- I thought that you...

37:46.932 --> 37:48.498
- can you get Harold Blake
for me?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.333
- Did you get a chance
to read Karen's manuscript?

37:50.335 --> 37:51.468
- Uh-huh.
Not yet.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.503
The Fisher book's exploding.

37:53.505 --> 37:54.938
But you will this week.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.439
- As soon
as I get a free moment.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.075
Now, Milan did an interview
with the press office.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.378
Can you see if he said anything
we haven't heard before?

38:01.380 --> 38:02.512
This week?

38:02.514 --> 38:04.281
- I'm sorry?
- This week.

38:04.283 --> 38:05.915
Oh, yes, of course.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.485
I really need to talk
to Harold.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.553
Harold's on line one.

38:18.596 --> 38:22.198
"The only real rule
of good writing is generosity. "

38:22.200 --> 38:27.037
- Rule number one...
generosity.

38:27.039 --> 38:29.539
You must be willing
to share yourself.

38:29.541 --> 38:32.275
Oh, I brought you a present.
- You did?

38:32.277 --> 38:34.244
Yeah.

38:34.246 --> 38:37.147
It's a birthday present.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.482
I wrote you a poem.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.318
- I didn't know
you write poetry.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.654
- I don't,
but you inspire me, so...

38:44.656 --> 38:46.690
Come.

39:13.484 --> 39:16.052
Um...

39:25.529 --> 39:27.130
What do you think?

39:27.132 --> 39:30.033
- Uh, it's... it's...
it's nice.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.137
"Nice"?

39:36.407 --> 39:40.110
- I have a... I have
a precalc test tomorrow.

39:40.112 --> 39:42.645
Jesus, I hate this stuff.
- Alice?

39:42.647 --> 39:44.714
It's okay.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.319
- Okay.
I'm glad you liked the poem.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.457
Anything we can use?

39:54.459 --> 39:56.626
- Nothing that we
haven't heard before.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.194
Damn.

39:58.196 --> 40:01.264
Get me Susan
at Simon & Schuster.

40:07.605 --> 40:10.073
Sorry.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.641
So are you ever on time?

40:11.643 --> 40:14.310
- No.
But, um...

40:14.312 --> 40:16.379
I got you these.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.483
Thanks.

40:49.513 --> 40:51.481
- Oh, wow.
Alfred marks began working

40:51.483 --> 40:53.783
at the white house
at the age of 28.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.286
Good for Alfred.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.125
Louise Van Der Zwan...

41:02.127 --> 41:03.793
okay, stop.
- All right, stop.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.462
What?

41:05.464 --> 41:08.331
- Is this what you do
every Sunday morning?

41:08.333 --> 41:11.835
You just sit here
and envy other people's lives?

41:11.837 --> 41:15.605
- No, that is pretty much
a full-time occupation.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.173
- You know
it's pointless, right?

41:17.175 --> 41:18.808
Yes, I do.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.412
You can't write in front of me.
- What?

41:22.414 --> 41:24.481
- No, I'm serious. If anyone's
gonna write in my apartment,

41:24.483 --> 41:26.216
it's going to be me.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.151
But you don't.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.786
- Thank you
for pointing that out.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.489
- Come on, it's not
like there's a finite number

41:32.491 --> 41:33.590
of words in the room,

41:33.592 --> 41:34.824
and if I use them all,

41:34.826 --> 41:36.593
there won't be enough
left for you.

41:39.096 --> 41:42.866
- Why does everything you say
have to make so much sense?

41:42.868 --> 41:44.467
It's fucking infuriating.

41:49.875 --> 41:53.109
Okay, shut up now.

42:04.122 --> 42:08.558
- Seeing
anyone special, sport?

42:08.560 --> 42:11.661
Not really.

42:11.663 --> 42:14.564
- You know,
having children

42:14.566 --> 42:17.867
is the most satisfying thing
life has to offer.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.738
Yeah.

42:21.740 --> 42:25.208
How's the writing going?

42:25.210 --> 42:27.343
Oh, you know...

42:27.345 --> 42:30.280
There is a book that I read
that I thought was terrific.

42:30.282 --> 42:31.714
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm trying to get Jack

42:31.716 --> 42:32.715
to read it.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.484
Yeah?

42:34.486 --> 42:37.287
- Um, well, I thought that
maybe you would have a look.

42:37.289 --> 42:40.523
Maybe you'd want
to meet with the writer.

42:40.525 --> 42:42.292
Jack hasn't read it?

42:42.294 --> 42:43.793
- Don't worry about that.
I'll get him to read it.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.629
I just... I just thought
you might want to meet with her.

42:46.631 --> 42:49.699
Her name's Karen Malone.
She, um... she did "Iowa. "

42:49.701 --> 42:51.301
She has this amazing
short story.

42:51.303 --> 42:54.504
- No, no.
I'm going to call him up.

42:54.506 --> 42:56.573
- No, dad. Please don't.
That's not what I meant.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.341
- Well, I can fix it,
sport.

42:58.343 --> 43:00.310
- Dad, dad,
I'll get him to read it.

43:00.312 --> 43:03.212
I just wanted your opinion.

43:03.214 --> 43:04.881
Okay.

43:04.883 --> 43:07.216
- Dad, I mean it.
Don't call him.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.918
- Okay, honey,
I won't call him.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.387
Hey, tiger.

43:11.389 --> 43:13.690
Are you having fun?
Huh?

43:26.670 --> 43:28.638
Great work.

43:28.640 --> 43:32.709
Um, Alice,
can you hang out a minute?

43:32.711 --> 43:35.712
Look, do you want me
to refund your tuition?

43:38.248 --> 43:39.415
What?

43:39.417 --> 43:40.650
- It's past
the official deadline,

43:40.652 --> 43:42.752
but I could ask them
to make an exception.

43:47.925 --> 43:51.694
- It's not
that I'm not trying.

43:51.696 --> 43:54.764
- Why don't you sign up again
when you feel like you're ready?

44:00.237 --> 44:03.406
Thanks.

44:03.408 --> 44:04.974
Yeah, I know he's doing a lot
of press right now,

44:04.976 --> 44:06.809
but it would be great
if he could squeeze in

44:06.811 --> 44:10.480
the "waking eyes"
re-release party.

44:10.482 --> 44:13.616
Okay, no, I don't have
any confirmations yet, but...

44:13.618 --> 44:15.418
I can hold.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.420
- Is this
Jack Bauman's office?

44:17.422 --> 44:19.022
- Yeah,
is he expecting you?

44:19.024 --> 44:20.456
Karen Malone.

44:23.894 --> 44:25.695
Karen, hi.

44:25.697 --> 44:27.397
I'm Alice.
- Nice to meet you.

44:27.399 --> 44:29.432
It's really nice
to meet you too.

44:29.434 --> 44:31.367
- So could you tell him
I'm here?

44:31.369 --> 44:33.469
- Hey, Karen,
come on in.

44:33.471 --> 44:34.837
- Hi.
- Jack Bauman.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.272
- So nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

44:36.274 --> 44:37.940
- Alice. Hi.
- Dad?

44:37.942 --> 44:39.542
Am I late?

44:39.544 --> 44:42.912
See, sport,
I told you I'd fix it, huh?

44:42.914 --> 44:45.581
Can I take you to lunch
when we're through here?

44:45.583 --> 44:48.284
- Ben, good to see you.
- Hey.

44:48.286 --> 44:49.652
- Hi.
- Karen.

44:49.654 --> 44:51.988
- How are you?
- All right.

45:31.662 --> 45:34.831
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:34.833 --> 45:38.000
Uh, Keith.

45:38.002 --> 45:41.037
I'm watching Tyler.

45:41.039 --> 45:42.805
Oh, okay.

45:42.807 --> 45:45.842
- We were at the park all day.
He's taking a nap.

45:45.844 --> 45:47.977
- Um, I'm Alice.
- Yeah, um, hi.

45:47.979 --> 45:49.112
Hi.

45:49.114 --> 45:51.414
- Sadie's at, uh,
prenatal yoga.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.950
Um, she'll be back in,
like, an hour and a half.

45:53.952 --> 45:55.818
- Maybe you could just tell her
that I came by.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.754
She could call me.
- Yeah, sure.

45:57.756 --> 45:59.655
Okay.

45:59.657 --> 46:01.758
You know what? Actually, maybe
I'll just check on Tyler,

46:01.760 --> 46:04.827
if that's okay.
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

46:26.150 --> 46:29.085
- He's such a great kid.
- Yeah.

46:29.087 --> 46:32.922
I... we read this in my, uh,
modern lit class last year.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.090
Oh?

46:34.092 --> 46:37.160
I didn't finish it.

46:37.162 --> 46:40.429
- Well, you can have that copy
if you want.

46:40.431 --> 46:42.865
It's kind of dated.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.477
What?

47:06.456 --> 47:08.524
Keith?

47:14.665 --> 47:16.799
What the fuck are you doing?

47:16.801 --> 47:18.835
- Uh, what are you
doing home?

47:18.837 --> 47:22.038
- I decided to skip
deep relaxation.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.806
Is there someone in there?

47:23.808 --> 47:25.875
Um...

47:28.712 --> 47:30.112
- Keith,
get out of here.

47:30.114 --> 47:31.547
Okay.

47:33.550 --> 47:35.918
Um...
You owe me 40.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.987
- Now.
- Okay.

47:41.892 --> 47:43.893
- What the hell
are you doing?

47:43.895 --> 47:45.728
I don't know.

47:45.730 --> 47:46.929
- He's a kid.
- I know.

47:46.931 --> 47:48.531
- If Tyler had woken up,
oh, my god,

47:48.533 --> 47:49.832
he would've been so confused.
- I know.

47:49.834 --> 47:51.534
- What about Emmett?
- I know, I know.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.836
I don't know.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.074
- Hey, honey.
- Mama?

47:58.076 --> 47:59.742
Yeah, baby?

47:59.744 --> 48:00.910
Aunt Alice!

48:00.912 --> 48:04.313
- Aunt Alice
has to leave now.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.788
Okay.

49:38.141 --> 49:40.142
- Still waiting
on that updated guest list.

49:40.144 --> 49:43.245
I'm working on it.

49:43.247 --> 49:47.016
You could have told me that you
read it, that you liked it.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.851
That we're publishing it.

49:48.853 --> 49:50.319
You are?

49:50.321 --> 49:52.154
- I thought daddy
would've spread the word.

49:52.156 --> 49:54.023
- Well, who are you
assigning it to?

49:54.025 --> 49:56.258
I'm editing it myself.

49:56.260 --> 49:58.227
- It's not
your kind of book.

49:58.229 --> 49:59.328
Eh.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.830
I found her. I...

50:00.832 --> 50:03.265
Alice, that's your job.

50:03.267 --> 50:06.002
You cull the good stuff.
I decide if it's good enough.

50:06.004 --> 50:07.770
- Yeah, but listen,
I have some great ideas...

50:07.772 --> 50:09.772
- ...shh. Now, listen, there's no
way I'm going to let

50:09.774 --> 50:12.842
an inexperienced editor work
with an inexperienced writer.

50:12.844 --> 50:14.210
- I've worked here
for two years.

50:14.212 --> 50:15.378
- And how many books
have you edited?

50:15.380 --> 50:16.912
My point exactly.

50:16.914 --> 50:18.714
I will cc you in my notes.

50:18.716 --> 50:20.383
You can come to me with
your thoughts anytime you like.

50:20.385 --> 50:23.819
Now, listen, Milan is expecting
you at the taping tomorrow.

50:23.821 --> 50:25.888
The new novel
is almost unreadable.

50:25.890 --> 50:28.257
Make sure he sticks
to "waking eyes," okay?

50:28.259 --> 50:30.326
You're the best.

50:37.401 --> 50:39.969
- So 15 years.
- Mm-hmm.

50:39.971 --> 50:44.040
- You've written seven novels
since "waking eyes,"

50:44.042 --> 50:48.277
and none has become
the kind of cultural icon.

50:49.646 --> 50:51.947
No, unfortunately not.

50:51.949 --> 50:54.250
What do you think makes it

50:54.252 --> 50:57.319
so perennially popular?

50:57.321 --> 50:59.388
Um...

51:01.391 --> 51:04.894
What I think it is, is that
everyone has been a teenager,

51:04.896 --> 51:07.296
and...

51:07.298 --> 51:11.934
We all know how out of kilter
it makes you.

51:14.839 --> 51:16.238
- All right.
Is it...

51:16.240 --> 51:17.840
okay, so are you gonna
tell me the secret now?

51:17.842 --> 51:19.408
- All right, I think
I'm gonna actually tell you.

51:19.410 --> 51:20.810
Come here for a second.

51:20.812 --> 51:22.244
No one can hear this,
actually.

51:26.384 --> 51:28.184
Mm.

51:28.186 --> 51:29.351
What?

51:29.353 --> 51:32.054
I have to go.

51:32.056 --> 51:34.890
So go.

51:56.980 --> 51:59.849
It's not important.

52:04.355 --> 52:06.856
- So the question
I have to ask...

52:06.858 --> 52:10.493
- Which I probably have answered
many times before, so go ahead.

52:10.495 --> 52:11.894
Possibly.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.729
How does a man in his 40s

52:13.731 --> 52:16.298
perfectly capture
the essence

52:16.300 --> 52:19.135
of a teenage girl?

52:19.137 --> 52:21.370
Um...

52:23.206 --> 52:25.975
This opening paragraph
is self-indulgent.

52:25.977 --> 52:28.277
95% of writing is rewriting.

52:28.279 --> 52:29.979
You know that.

52:29.981 --> 52:32.481
And here, here's
another dangling preposition.

52:32.483 --> 52:35.985
The way you mangle
the English language is...

52:35.987 --> 52:40.222
look at this.
I'm the immigrant here.

52:40.224 --> 52:43.859
- I was hanging out
with my friend. I forgot.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.165
I'm sorry.

52:55.039 --> 52:58.307
I do this because I believe
in your talent.

52:58.309 --> 53:00.376
I know.

53:01.945 --> 53:04.013
Come here.

53:13.523 --> 53:17.092
I do this
because I love you.

53:17.094 --> 53:19.161
- I know.
- Yeah.

53:19.163 --> 53:22.164
I met a boy.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.567
Oh, I'm happy.

53:24.569 --> 53:26.235
So glad.

53:26.237 --> 53:28.437
I want you to be happy.

53:31.942 --> 53:35.010
What can I do
to make you happy?

53:39.015 --> 53:40.316
We all like a mystery,

53:40.318 --> 53:42.218
but there's
no mystery girl in it.

53:42.220 --> 53:43.953
It's all fiction,

53:43.955 --> 53:47.556
and, um...

53:47.558 --> 53:50.993
At that time,
I did walk around in the city

53:50.995 --> 53:54.430
and listen in on subways,
coffee shops...

53:54.432 --> 53:56.131
- Mm-hmm.
- Streets, you know,

53:56.133 --> 53:58.033
and I still do,
now and then,

53:58.035 --> 54:00.836
listen in to see
if girls have changed.

54:00.838 --> 54:04.340
You know?
- Hmm. And have they?

54:04.342 --> 54:07.243
Some things never change.

54:12.415 --> 54:13.882
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:13.884 --> 54:15.150
Special delivery.

54:15.152 --> 54:18.420
- What the hell
are you doing here?

54:18.422 --> 54:19.955
No, no,
you need to go.

54:19.957 --> 54:22.324
I have somebody coming here.
- Another time?

54:22.326 --> 54:23.959
No, no.

54:23.961 --> 54:25.227
Why?

54:25.229 --> 54:27.396
- Look, I just turned 29.
- Really?

54:27.398 --> 54:29.164
- And I guess it
messed with my head.

54:29.166 --> 54:30.332
Shit.

54:34.237 --> 54:37.940
- Hey.
- Hi.

54:37.942 --> 54:39.975
This is Keith.

54:39.977 --> 54:41.543
Yeah?

54:41.545 --> 54:44.179
- Uh, he's
Sadie's babysitter.

54:44.181 --> 54:46.081
Yeah?

54:46.083 --> 54:48.317
- You her husband?
- Yeah.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.322
No.

54:53.324 --> 54:56.292
Keith was just leaving.

54:56.294 --> 54:58.494
Yeah, um...

54:58.496 --> 55:02.031
Sorry, man.

55:02.033 --> 55:04.566
I got us some wine.

55:07.504 --> 55:09.938
Alice?

55:09.940 --> 55:13.575
- I went to Sadie's the other
day, and I forgot that.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.645
And?

55:16.647 --> 55:19.348
- Well, I told him
that he could borrow it.

55:21.284 --> 55:24.353
- Before or after
you forgot it?

55:30.493 --> 55:32.961
Emmett.

55:32.963 --> 55:34.663
Did you...?

55:37.567 --> 55:40.202
Fuck.

55:42.205 --> 55:44.440
- Emmett, can...
can we just talk about it?

55:44.442 --> 55:46.475
Please, it was the day
that I found out

55:46.477 --> 55:47.976
about the manuscript.

55:47.978 --> 55:50.979
I was really upset.

55:50.981 --> 55:53.315
I am never gonna
to see this guy again.

55:53.317 --> 55:57.052
Emmett. Listen, let's just
talk about it.

55:59.589 --> 56:01.256
Emmett.

56:01.258 --> 56:04.760
- I will not let you make me
as crazy as you are.

56:19.243 --> 56:21.410
- Dad?
- Hey, champ, come.

56:21.412 --> 56:23.545
Come and meet Alana.

56:23.547 --> 56:26.715
- You must be Alice.
- Hi.

56:26.717 --> 56:29.051
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.487
Alana is
a fantastic conductor.

56:31.489 --> 56:35.190
Women are really coming
into their own in that field.

56:37.327 --> 56:39.728
What about Maya, dad?

56:39.730 --> 56:41.530
- I'm gonna see her.
Yeah.

56:41.532 --> 56:45.100
Helene just needs a little time
to cool down.

56:45.102 --> 56:46.735
Oh, dad.

56:46.737 --> 56:50.038
Hey, hey.

56:50.040 --> 56:53.275
You know how it is,
right?

56:58.114 --> 57:00.416
Sorry. I just, uh...

57:00.418 --> 57:03.218
Suddenly started
to just feel...

57:03.220 --> 57:04.253
- Alice?
- Excuse me.

57:04.255 --> 57:06.455
Alice.

57:18.701 --> 57:21.303
What are you doing here?

57:21.305 --> 57:23.305
I brought food.

57:23.307 --> 57:28.243
- You know how precious sleep
is to me.

57:28.245 --> 57:31.280
- I need to talk.
Sadie...

57:31.282 --> 57:34.216
- Emmett is my friend,
and Keith is our neighbors' kid.

57:34.218 --> 57:36.518
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Good.

57:39.088 --> 57:41.523
I brought Dulce de Leche.

57:43.326 --> 57:45.661
- You know I love you
more than almost anyone,

57:45.663 --> 57:49.198
except Tyler and rob
and my mother... Sometimes.

57:51.768 --> 57:56.238
But I'm starting
not to like you very much...

57:56.240 --> 57:59.374
And I'd never
forgive you for that.

58:05.515 --> 58:08.750
I need to not see you
for a while.

58:14.325 --> 58:15.691
What about the book?

58:15.693 --> 58:17.726
Screw you, Alice.

59:01.671 --> 59:04.406
- You know what?
I...

59:04.408 --> 59:07.142
can we just...
can we just not?

59:07.144 --> 59:08.477
What?

59:08.479 --> 59:12.414
I'm really tired.

59:12.416 --> 59:15.284
- No, I don't...
I don't think so.

59:18.321 --> 59:20.188
Okay.

59:20.190 --> 59:22.791
- We did things.
- "Things"?

59:22.793 --> 59:24.860
Things.

59:36.539 --> 59:38.407
You hooked up.

59:38.409 --> 59:40.475
Yeah.

59:50.420 --> 59:54.256
Was it wonderful?

59:54.258 --> 59:56.558
It should be wonderful.
Was it?

59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.697
Mm...

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:04.666
- Please,
tell me about it...

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:07.669
come on,
how it was like.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.410
Did he make you come?

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:24.319
I want to make you come.

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:27.656
I want to be first person
to make you come.

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.993
Come here.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.902
Look at me.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.479
Don't close your eyes.

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:52.748
Open your eyes.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:53.982
Don't close your eyes.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:56.551
That's not the way
we do it.

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:08.563
Look at me.

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:19.921
It's just something that I do,
that I've always done.

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.857
I see that look
in a guy's eyes,

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:24.993
like he wants me.

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:26.595
I don't know.

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:29.064
It's the only thing
that makes me feel real.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.736
I want you.

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:36.805
I know.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.508
So?

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:41.977
So it wears off.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:44.679
Like...

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.948
I start wondering,
"what's wrong with this guy?

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.885
Why can't he do better?"

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.989
That is unbearably sad.

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.559
I know.

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:01.963
But I probably can.

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.136
Yeah.

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.103
Hey.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.172
Give me a hug.

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:47.976
- I got a hose.
- Cool.

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:49.678
It's an ambush.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.013
- Where's my hat?
I need to be protected.

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:54.082
Here you go.

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:02.290
- I can't not be your friend
for one more day.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.359
With friends like you...

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.299
Honey, be careful.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.702
- I figure if even you
can't put up with me,

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:15.704
I'm gonna have to do
something about it.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.075
Yeah, you better.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.981
- Aunt Alice,
emergency, emergency!

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:29.084
You're on fire!
- I am?

01:06:29.086 --> 01:06:32.721
Say "help"!

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:34.956
Help.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.827
Um, hi.
My name is Alice Harvey.

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.062
I am a volunteer
for people for the people,

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:42.831
and I'm calling you because...

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:44.866
This is such
an important election,

01:06:44.868 --> 01:06:47.635
and it's so important
that you...

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.871
hello?

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:51.906
Hey, you made it.

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:53.041
Of course.

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:54.709
Come on in.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:55.810
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:57.946
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

01:06:57.948 --> 01:06:59.314
Everyone, listen up.

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:01.016
Let's take
a little five-minute break.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.617
Put your phones down.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.686
This is Emmett Grant,

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.788
who founded
people for the people.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.923
He is the guy
that got us all here tonight.

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:10.358
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.894
- I didn't get you here.
You got yourselves here.

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:16.364
Everybody take a look
around the room.

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.936
I forgot to thank our hostess
for this evening.

01:07:21.938 --> 01:07:23.972
Thanks.

01:07:23.974 --> 01:07:25.807
Did you look around?

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.642
It's a room
full of people, right?

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:30.045
See, we reached out to you.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:31.279
Tonight you're here.

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.881
You're reaching out
to others,

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:34.349
and then with any luck,

01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:36.351
those others are
gonna reach out

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.787
on election day
and fill in the right bubbles,

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:40.789
and maybe together,

01:07:40.791 --> 01:07:44.159
we can change
the political landscape.

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:46.061
If not...

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:52.167
We can because it's
the reaching out that matters.

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:54.736
It's the reaching out that
scares the shit out of them,

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:57.372
even when our guys don't win.

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.174
So please, please,

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:01.209
just keep reaching out.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:02.410
Thank you.
- Whoo-hoo.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.913
- Yeah!
- Awesome.

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.748
That was a really nice speech.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.983
- I should have known.
- Listen, I love you both.

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:11.086
- You've got
about five minutes.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:18.359
- How could you use this event
for personal reasons?

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:20.261
That's not fair.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.863
I wanted to help you. I know
how important this is to you.

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.765
Keep calling.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.267
Emmett...

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.871
- no, actions
have consequences, Alice.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.240
Hey, we got to move on.

01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:35.944
I'm reaching out.

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.513
I have to go.

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:36.970
<I>- Please, please, please,
just keep reaching out.

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.345
- What would you like,
sport?

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.115
- I'd like to start
with the arugula salad, please.

01:09:47.117 --> 01:09:49.283
- You know, the duck
is fabulous here.

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:51.953
You should try it.
- And I'd like the filet.

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.022
- Why don't you bring her
the duck?

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:56.124
Milan...

01:09:56.126 --> 01:09:59.194
You want to tell them?

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:00.261
It's all your doing.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:02.063
Bullshit.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:06.267
Bookseller preorders for
"waking eyes," unbelievable.

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:08.203
We may have a best seller
on our hands.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:10.838
- Oh.
- You're a genius, pal.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.974
- Hayworth's
marketing department is.

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:15.877
- Okay,
so we're all geniuses.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.579
Please pass the rolls.

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:19.280
Sylvio is good,

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:22.283
but not if he doesn't have
something great to sell.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:23.885
- Could you pass
the rolls, please?

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.420
- Would you just stop
kissing each others' asses

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:26.821
and enjoy the moment?

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.022
- Do you have to be
so crude?

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:29.557
- Do you have to be
so smug?

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.060
I'm happy.

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:35.196
Not that you'd have any idea
what that feels like.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:37.031
- Mm-hmm.
I wonder why.

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:41.603
- Actually, I'd like
to stick to the filet.

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:43.571
Okay, sport.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:47.508
And duck for me
and a side of spinach.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:51.879
So can anybody explain to me
the appeal

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:54.515
of that... that... that guy
in that movie.

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:59.020
Oh, jeez, you know the one,
the one that won best picture.

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.957
- I can messenger a copy
over today.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.458
Yes, I will hold.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.361
Hi.
Um, one second.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.230
Uh, yeah,
I'll send it right over.

01:11:42.232 --> 01:11:46.267
Okay, great.
Thanks.

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:49.137
- My agent said
that you gave him my book.

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:50.471
<I>Shit!

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:53.441
- I'm not sure
I did you any favors.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:57.312
- I was actually working on
something new before all this,

01:11:57.314 --> 01:12:01.015
and, um, I would love
if you could take a look.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.216
Yeah?

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:06.020
It's my first chapter.

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:08.923
- I-I'd love to.
Um...

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:10.958
- Great.
- Thank you.

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:46.094
Look into the camera.

01:12:46.096 --> 01:12:47.695
Wave to the camera.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.264
- Yes, Greenstreet
is coming.

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:53.968
Terrific.
How many guests will that be?

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:55.169
Okay, great.

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:57.238
Thanks.

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:03.378
Alice.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.047
- He's just finishing up a call.
He should be right out.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:09.417
Could I take you to lunch?

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:12.387
Why?

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.489
- Sorry to make you wait.
Hot off the presses.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:17.291
One for you.
One for you.

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.559
It's got the new dedication.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.361
- Oh, that's great.
- Nice, huh?

01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:22.430
Come in, come in.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:40.615
<I>- "Still she haunts me
phantomwise,

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:43.751
<I>"Alice moving under skies,

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.487
<I>never seen by waking eyes. "

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.360
Milan Daneker...

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:54.162
he'll be reading
from his new novel,

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:56.097
"waking eyes. "

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:57.498
Mr. Daneker.

01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:04.639
- Thank you, Martin.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:06.707
Sorry.

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:16.451
Yes.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.321
"She was slouching
under the weight

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:23.658
"of a too-big book bag,

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.161
"cracking her gum fiercely

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:29.597
"like a line of defense.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:35.636
"But her eyes cried out,

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.439
'love me.
Oh, please, love me. '"

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:42.376
"'a little lonely,'
she said.

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:46.247
"'My mom has no idea
who I am anymore,

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:48.316
"but maybe she never did. '

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:52.320
"she swayed
with a graceful pas de deux,

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:55.122
"the dance of hate.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.824
"She was small enough.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:15:01.162
"She was invisible to them
and always would be.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:05.166
"Her eyes opened
wider and wider

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:07.768
"as she came,

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:11.572
brimming with surprise"...

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:17.445
"Pleasure,
and ineffable sadness. "

01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:18.779
Thank you.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.691
Alice?

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.867
Alice, what is it?

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:46.307
- I have to tell
you something.

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:50.645
Fantastic night.

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:52.613
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're a natural.

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:54.682
- No, I was terrified.
- You were great.

01:15:54.684 --> 01:15:55.883
Wasn't he great?
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:57.451
Yes,
it went very well.

01:15:57.453 --> 01:15:58.786
- I can't believe
that woman

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:00.454
from the New York review
of books was there.

01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:01.822
She was interesting.

01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:04.625
- She was eating
out of your hand.

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:06.694
Ben.

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:13.401
Alice, um...

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:16.404
Your mother
told me what you said.

01:16:16.406 --> 01:16:17.905
I had to.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:21.809
- Yes, I told him
it wasn't true.

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:23.411
What?

01:16:23.413 --> 01:16:25.680
- It isn't true?
- It's what he said.

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:28.516
I asked him.
He said it's understandable.

01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:30.251
Yes.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.254
Like I told him, you maybe
misinterpreted it somehow.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:35.289
- Is that what it is,
Alice?

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.725
- I think it's
what you wish were true.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:40.194
- Alice?
- Stop the car.

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:43.631
- It's perfectly natural
to have feelings for someone

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.633
that you look up to.
- I'm flattered.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:47.368
- I really... I don't know
what to think anymore.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:50.471
- He said he may have used
details from your life...

01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:51.806
Writers are magpies.

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:54.241
- To make the character
more real.

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:56.243
Please stop the car!

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:57.845
Alice.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:59.914
Alice!

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:20.368
Hey.

01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:22.670
What are you doing here?

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:24.739
Are you okay?

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.943
Alice?

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:38.352
Are you all right?

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:41.656
Oh, please, please.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:44.425
It's, um...
- is this the new book?

01:17:44.427 --> 01:17:47.261
Yeah.

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.797
- Whose life did
you appropriate this time?

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.866
No one.

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:57.638
Uh, well, there's bits
and pieces here and there.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.807
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:01.876
Yeah.

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:16.290
- It was such
a long time ago.

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:18.359
What?

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.362
What...
- Alice.

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:24.765
Was such a long time ago?

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:28.002
Concrete details.

01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:31.305
You must give me concrete
details to make it real.

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:34.642
- I know at that age,
little things seem enormous.

01:18:34.644 --> 01:18:36.544
Your warm...

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:40.314
Heavy arms around me...

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:43.784
The smoky taste
of your tongue in my mouth.

01:18:43.786 --> 01:18:45.386
I was helping you.

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:47.555
- The feel of your hard-on
against my thigh.

01:18:47.557 --> 01:18:50.024
- But nothing really happened.
- Yes, it did!

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:52.093
- Yes, well, you seemed
to enjoy it at the time.

01:18:52.095 --> 01:18:56.931
- You were one
of the few people who ever...

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:59.967
Actually seemed to see me...

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:04.705
To make me feel real
and important.

01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:07.041
- But you are.
- You used me.

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:08.976
- Oh, come on.
- You abandoned me.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:10.911
- Alice...
- you made me feel

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:13.481
like I was nothing
all over again.

01:19:13.483 --> 01:19:15.616
- Not nothing.
It's...

01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:18.753
It's a beautiful character.

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:20.621
I know.

01:19:20.623 --> 01:19:25.526
And I've been living
in her shadow for 15 years.

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:33.467
Good-bye, Milan.

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.542
Hey, Emmett.

01:20:14.544 --> 01:20:17.077
What?

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:19.146
Come here.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.651
- What?
Did Jeff screw up again?

01:20:23.653 --> 01:20:26.720
- No, I just got
a Google alert.

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:37.865
<I>- Reaching out scares
the shit out of them,

01:20:37.867 --> 01:20:40.568
<I>even when
our guys don't win.

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:44.839
<I>So please, please, please,
just keep reaching out.

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:19.039
<I>Because I love you.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.579
- Gentlemen.
How are we?

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:26.847
Where's Alice?

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:31.585
- I haven't seen her yet.
Sadie?

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:32.786
Where the hell is Alice?

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:35.256
- She had something better
to do.

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:36.757
- What?
- Wait. Who are you?

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:38.959
Her best friend.

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:40.828
Are you ready to read,
Mr. Daneker?

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:42.029
I am.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:45.099
Walk this way.

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:07.888
Some old lady

01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:12.059
with a slight beard
let me in.

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:15.229
Mrs. Rayburn.

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.298
Oh.

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:25.239
Emmett...

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:33.314
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:39.286
Thanks.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:41.555
- I might not be ready
to take on the world,

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:43.691
but I think...

01:22:43.693 --> 01:22:45.859
That I can remember...

01:22:45.861 --> 01:22:49.029
To think
about one other person.

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:51.332
Yeah?

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:57.304
I'd like that to be you.

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:02.776
I'll think about it.

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.948
Okay.

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:11.018
100 was really good.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:38.078
- You're the girl
in the book, aren't you?

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:43.283
Not anymore.
