08:56.770 --> 08:58.436
Ahh, so nice to meet you.

08:58.472 --> 08:59.571
Now, this is Victor Lustig,

08:59.606 --> 09:01.373
he's our lawyer and
all-around advisor.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.073
Nice to meet you.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.542
A pleasure.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.844
Eileen says that Alex can do
a podcast on Dad's accident.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.312
Well, what about the accident?

09:07.347 --> 09:09.614
Well, I'm not exactly sure yet,
but if you were there then

09:09.650 --> 09:11.216
I'd love to talk to you
about it.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.218
Well, I'm leaving for Napa
this afternoon,

09:13.253 --> 09:15.186
but, uh, perhaps
when I get back.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.488
Uh, Gil, when you're ready
to meet,

09:16.523 --> 09:18.323
uh, let me know
and I'll get Jackson.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.225
Will do. Yeah.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.893
So, how does it work?

09:21.929 --> 09:23.695
Uh, Eileen says
you can solve this.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.031
Oh, well I don't know
about solving it...

09:26.066 --> 09:28.133
Uh, oh, she's been
really modest.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.801
She's had incredible results.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.903
I have been a bit lucky,
but, um,

09:31.939 --> 09:33.905
I can't make any guarantees,
you understand.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.974
I'm just happy that you're
gonna give it a try, so...

09:36.009 --> 09:37.642
Can I, uh, take you through it?

09:37.678 --> 09:41.379
Yes. Now, um, okay, uh,

09:41.415 --> 09:43.915
I would like to record our
conversation, if you don't mind.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.016
Yeah, go ahead.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.585
You know, I'm gonna
go find Mary.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.954
And we'll talk later?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.523
Yes.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.858
Okay, I'm ready.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.161
So, this is where it happened.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.163
Um...

10:00.734 --> 10:03.535
[clears throat uncomfortably]
I'm sorry.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.770
It's still a little difficult.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.771
Of course it is.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.306
I'm sorry for your loss.

10:08.342 --> 10:11.509
You know, I did some research
about this kind of accident,

10:11.545 --> 10:13.511
and it does seem to happen-

10:13.547 --> 10:14.646
No.

10:14.681 --> 10:15.614
-at wineries.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.282
My dad was never
that careless.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.717
Look at this place. Hmm.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.952
I mean, we just renovated
two years ago.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.021
This equipment's practically
brand new,

10:23.056 --> 10:26.124
and we tested everything after.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.592
Nothing was broken.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.328
Gil, do you have a theory
of what happened?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.064
Mary.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.766
Jackson's wife.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.834
Gil.

10:35.902 --> 10:36.835
[clears throat]

10:36.903 --> 10:37.969
We need to look into the...
Hi.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.706
Alex McPherson, meet
my brother, Jackson.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.974
Um, nice to meet you.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.175
Nice to meet you.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.577
She's Eileen's friend
from "The Chronicle".

10:45.612 --> 10:47.379
Ah.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.348
Are you doing a... a story
about the winery?

10:50.384 --> 10:53.318
Well, I have an
investigative podcast,

10:53.353 --> 10:56.287
and I'm looking into what
happened to your father.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.322
Ah.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.727
Would you excuse us a minute,
Ms. McPherson?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.295
Yes, of course.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.898
<i> [whispers harshly]</i>
<i> What are you doing?</i>

11:06.933 --> 11:07.565
<i> Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i> about this?</i>

11:07.601 --> 11:09.167
[recorder beeps]

11:09.202 --> 11:09.868
<i> Because you're never around,</i>
<i> you don't answer your messages.</i>

11:09.903 --> 11:11.169
<i> I'm taking care of it.</i>

11:11.204 --> 11:12.170
I don't answer my messages?
I'm here all the time.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.438
I called you five times
last week.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.739
<i> [angry whisper]</i>
<i> I'm here, but what is this?</i>

11:14.775 --> 11:16.207
Listen, she's a friend
of Eileen's,

11:16.243 --> 11:17.475
she's gonna take care of it.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.877
<i> She's a reporter,</i>
<i> and it doesn't matter...</i>

11:18.912 --> 11:20.078
<i> She does a podcast.</i>

11:20.147 --> 11:21.212
<i> That's not gonna make the winey</i>
<i> look good.</i>

11:21.248 --> 11:23.348
Joint decisions, man.
Joint decisions.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.083
This is not.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.827
Gil, uh... Am I getting
the feeling that...

11:35.896 --> 11:38.430
Don't worry. I can
handle it.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.032
Come on, I want to show
you something.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.638
So, listen, Gil.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.008
I'm not exactly comfortable if
your family is not on board.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.309
I'm supposed to wait

11:51.344 --> 11:53.178
for Jackson's permission
to find out what happened?

11:53.246 --> 11:56.748
Especially when it was his wife
that...

11:56.783 --> 11:58.717
Here's everything
I've collected so far.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.918
He finally gave me the files

11:59.986 --> 12:01.386
from the Sheriff's
investigation.

12:01.455 --> 12:02.954
Is there something in this
that made you suspect

12:02.989 --> 12:04.322
it wasn't an accident?

12:04.391 --> 12:07.926
Well, I've been suspicious since
the day it happened.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.161
Now, last week, I was going
through Dad's papers

12:10.197 --> 12:12.597
looking for his shares
of the vineyard...

12:12.632 --> 12:13.465
The shares?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.200
Just some papers
we can't locate.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.735
[sighs]

12:16.770 --> 12:19.037
And I found this.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.139
Your father was leaving you
the entire vineyard.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.475
Jackson and I both had
small shares already.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.511
Twenty percent each, so Jackson
still would've had 20 percent.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.413
But it says here he could only
sell them to you,

12:28.482 --> 12:30.849
and you could choose the price.

12:30.884 --> 12:31.649
It's not signed.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.418
But it's dated October 28th.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.887
That's the day we were supposed
to have a family meeting.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.322
Why do you think
your father decided

12:37.357 --> 12:39.190
to cut your brother
out of the will?

12:39.226 --> 12:40.358
Jackson may not know grapes,

12:40.393 --> 12:43.628
but he's good at managing
the business.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.230
I think it had to do with Mary.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.198
Dad was always convinced
she was a gold digger,

12:47.234 --> 12:50.602
and didn't want her to get
her hands on the place.

12:50.637 --> 12:54.305
Stupid thing is, I'd never
cut Jackson out.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.574
But if his wife saw this and
thought it might happen...

12:56.610 --> 12:57.675
[knocking at door]

12:57.711 --> 12:58.676
<i> Victor's ready for us.</i>

12:58.712 --> 13:01.646
Yeah, I'll be right there,
Jackson.

13:01.681 --> 13:02.680
[clears throat uncomfortably]

13:02.716 --> 13:04.449
Guess I'd better go calm
the waters.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.217
You can hang on to this stuff
if you want,

13:06.253 --> 13:08.019
but just keep it quiet
for now, okay?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.053
Sure.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.089
Yeah. I think I'd
better take this.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.624
It's the only copy I have.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.925
Do you mind if I just...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.593
grab a photo of that
real quick?

13:15.662 --> 13:16.427
For my files.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.463
Sure.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.464
Um... Okay....

13:19.499 --> 13:20.465
[camera shutter snaps]

13:20.500 --> 13:22.167
Right, uh... Great.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.435
[clears throat]

13:24.471 --> 13:26.971
You and Eileen coming back
for dinner later?

13:27.007 --> 13:27.906
Sure.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.108
We'd love to.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.943
[whispers]
Okay...

13:32.813 --> 13:34.345
I'm sorry, Mary, I thought
you'd be happy.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.247
This investigation
was your idea.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.549
Don't you want to know
what happened?

13:37.617 --> 13:39.017
We know what happened.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.653
Colton got careless, it was
a terrible accident.

13:41.721 --> 13:42.487
Eileen.

13:42.556 --> 13:43.354
Oh, Alex.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.189
Hi.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.156
This is Mary Saunier.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.324
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.792
Your vineyard is beautiful.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.861
Well, it certainly isn't mine,
but thank you.

13:49.930 --> 13:50.795
You got your tour?

13:50.831 --> 13:51.596
We did.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.797
Even the aromatic part.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.898
[laughs]

13:53.934 --> 13:54.599
Eileen!

13:54.668 --> 13:55.867
Rancid, isn't it?

13:55.902 --> 13:57.035
That's the Kelleher farm,

13:57.070 --> 13:59.270
it's started to leech
onto our vineyard.

13:59.306 --> 14:03.241
Donna Kelleher is a menace,
her endless lawsuits.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.977
Victor and Jackson will get that
all figured out.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.313
Well, I should go
get settled in.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.749
No offence, Ms. McPherson.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.184
I had no idea why
you were coming

14:13.220 --> 14:15.186
and I'm not at all sure
it's a good idea.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.955
This is not good publicity
for us,

14:16.990 --> 14:18.523
and it was very selfish
and stubborn of Gil

14:18.592 --> 14:21.526
to re-open these wounds.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.495
Uh, I have another tour starting
in five minutes.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.697
[clears throat]

14:25.732 --> 14:27.799
[whispers aggressively]
Excuse me.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.970
I told you. Subtext.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.671
Hidden currents.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.707
[whispers] I... I didn't realize
that the "hidden currents"

14:35.742 --> 14:37.008
were that they
don't want me here.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.509
Don't worry about it.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.812
People are always itching to
tell their side of the story.

14:40.881 --> 14:44.315
And Gil did ask,
after I opened the door.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.885
Though, I don't know why
he was so eager.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.353
[whispers] Oh, I am.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.356
He just found out that his
father had drawn up a new will,

14:51.391 --> 14:55.493
that Colton was going to leave
everything to Gil.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.596
<i> I still can't get over the smel</i>
<i> on those back acres.</i>

14:58.632 --> 15:00.531
<i> Fighting with their neighbours</i>
<i> about it?</i>

15:00.567 --> 15:01.566
Could be a motive.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.668
For a lawsuit, sure.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.870
But for murder?

15:05.939 --> 15:09.607
Well, it's definitely worth
checking out.

15:09.643 --> 15:10.541
I don't know.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.609
Do you think a stench like that

15:11.678 --> 15:17.415
would be possible
from farm waste?

15:17.450 --> 15:18.950
Or is it something else?

15:18.985 --> 15:20.785
I don't do manure.

15:20.854 --> 15:21.719
[laughs]

15:21.755 --> 15:23.221
Of course. Oh, thank you.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.188
Yeah.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.424
Wait... Let's see if...

15:26.459 --> 15:30.561
[phone rings]

15:30.597 --> 15:31.863
Hi, boss.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.998
Hey, Chuck, I have a stinky
farm question for you.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.833
Ah, all the good ones are.
Shoot.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.169
What kind of pollution do you
think would cause a farm

15:38.238 --> 15:42.674
to smell like, I don't know,
like rotten eggs, maybe?

15:42.709 --> 15:45.643
Rotten eggs that took
a bath in fertilizer,

15:45.679 --> 15:47.979
and then cheated on the
fertilizer with some ammonia.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.380
<i> Ugh.</i>

15:49.416 --> 15:50.748
Well, that's some very nasty
soil with low morals.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.884
Uh, hard to say.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.452
Could you get a sample
to a horticulturist?

15:54.487 --> 15:55.586
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.821
I'll find one online.

15:56.856 --> 15:57.555
Thank you, Chuck.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.790
Yeah, anytime.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.391
Welcome.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.893
Like, now?

16:01.928 --> 16:03.161
I'm here.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.863
I... see that.

16:05.932 --> 16:06.898
Hey.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.733
Wow, what are you guys
doing here?

16:08.768 --> 16:09.901
Did you check in already?

16:09.936 --> 16:11.436
You know, don't even
answer that,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.137
because I'm gonna make sure
they put you into room number 7.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.105
Come on, Chuck.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.573
Oh, it's exquisite.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.808
There's a view on both sides.

16:16.843 --> 16:17.976
What, you didn't want
to miss out on the wine?

16:18.044 --> 16:19.210
No, of course not.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.778
Field trip, you know?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.014
I thought, might as well take
a look at that Macklin story.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.682
It's all good, Miles has got
the fort back home.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.984
Oh, I bet he does.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.785
He sent you here, didn't he?
To check up on me.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.421
Oh please, I've got plenty
of work to do.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.290
Real reporting, actually.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.391
You won't even see us.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.092
[laughs]

16:34.127 --> 16:35.326
Right, 'cause, you know,

16:35.362 --> 16:38.363
you don't take up any room
or anything.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.331
[sighs]

16:40.367 --> 16:41.499
Oh, can I organize
the photos?

16:41.534 --> 16:42.734
Sure, thanks Chuck.

16:42.802 --> 16:43.868
Wow.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.670
Old dusty files become
the treasure map.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.739
Especially in a cold case.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.607
You never know what someone
overlooked or,

16:49.676 --> 16:52.543
you know, means something
different months later.

16:52.612 --> 16:53.644
Exactly.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.413
Do we have names
for any of these guys?

16:55.448 --> 16:56.614
Those are the Sauniers.

16:56.649 --> 16:57.382
Yeah.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.950
And maybe that's Victor.

16:59.019 --> 16:59.584
Does it say on the back?

16:59.652 --> 17:00.651
Uh...

17:03.757 --> 17:05.156
Yeah, Victor Lustig.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.758
What else do you got?

17:06.793 --> 17:09.494
Who's this guy on the left?

17:09.529 --> 17:12.330
That guy...
Andy Woods.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.831
Andy Woods?

17:13.867 --> 17:16.034
That's what it says the Sheriff
listed as the only suspect

17:16.069 --> 17:18.036
in Colton's death.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.537
Says that he worked
at the winery.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.705
Ah, I remember, yeah.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.874
He was this troubled kid
that Colton took in

17:22.942 --> 17:24.175
and then mentored.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.411
I mean, Gil said he was a very
talented vintner.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.745
Wait a second.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.680
It says here that three weeks
before Colton died,

17:29.716 --> 17:34.719
Andy Woods was caught writing
cheques on the winery account.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.621
Cheques made out to cash?

17:36.689 --> 17:40.324
Rookie move. Of course
he'd get caught.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.162
Yeah, I mean, to turn on his
own mentor out of nowhere?

17:44.230 --> 17:47.565
It says that he was fired,
but that he didn't go quietly.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.134
He claims that he was framed
and that these cheques

17:50.170 --> 17:51.669
aren't even in his handwriting.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.338
Sounds to me like we need
to pay him a visit.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.373
Yeah.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.908
We need, like, tape
or something.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.576
Maybe we could pick some up
on the way back from dinner.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.178
Oh, dinner. I'm starved.

18:00.213 --> 18:00.945
Oh.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.280
Oh... I'll call Gil.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.115
I'm sure he won't mind.
If they come.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.083
Good idea.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.384
You can come.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.752
You know what, it sounds like
the family wasn't

18:07.821 --> 18:09.287
really that happy to see anyone
from "The Chronicle",

18:09.322 --> 18:11.289
so... we'll be fine.
You guys go.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.028
So, nothing for Jackson
and his family?

18:17.063 --> 18:20.798
Like a small buyout over time.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.233
Do you think Jackson
and Mary know?

18:22.268 --> 18:23.234
[sighs]

18:23.269 --> 18:24.402
Gil isn't sure.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.170
Yeah, but he did hide the will
from Jackson

18:26.206 --> 18:27.972
when he came
into the office.

18:28.007 --> 18:31.042
[gunshots]

18:31.077 --> 18:32.076
What was that?

18:32.112 --> 18:34.612
C-c-could be hunters.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.613
[a woman's screams]

18:37.050 --> 18:38.249
There's a service route.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.251
Let's go. Come on.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.819
I don't know.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.154
There was a gunshot.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.556
I heard a gunshot.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.191
I can't see it.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.462
Will.... Is that you?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.964
Are you here?

18:52.999 --> 18:55.733
Who's coming down the road?

18:55.768 --> 18:58.069
I don't know, I can't see
his chest moving.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.638
He's not breathing,
what do, what do I...

19:00.673 --> 19:03.374
Send someone now!

19:05.044 --> 19:06.410
[gasps in shock]

19:08.381 --> 19:10.982
<i> [distant sirens wail]</i>

19:18.057 --> 19:19.524
All right Jackson, we're going
to need to bag your hands

19:19.559 --> 19:23.161
until we can test
for gunshot residue, okay?

19:23.229 --> 19:25.530
I... I fired a warning shot
back by the fence line,

19:25.565 --> 19:26.931
there were some hunters
goofing around.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.232
They must have been those
hunters who did this,

19:28.301 --> 19:29.600
so go find those hunters.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.570
No. Send someone
to go find those hunters!

19:32.605 --> 19:34.071
I have deputies searching
the area.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.339
Are you arresting
my husband?

19:35.375 --> 19:38.509
Look, for now, we just need
a statement, okay?

19:38.545 --> 19:40.211
Okay, I'll see you
at the station.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.946
Jackson.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.581
Come on.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.886
Call Uncle Victor,
he'll know what to do.

19:48.955 --> 19:49.854
If there anything we can do?

19:49.923 --> 19:51.756
Give us some privacy, please.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.858
Of course.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.071
[door creaks open]

20:07.140 --> 20:08.472
Hey.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.840
You guys are okay?

20:09.909 --> 20:10.675
Yeah.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.909
You didn't have to come.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.044
Of course.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.845
We were worried
about you guys.

20:14.881 --> 20:15.880
That poor family.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.482
They've lost two people
in 12 months.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.751
You think they were connected?

20:20.787 --> 20:24.121
All right, so Gil's shooting
is the active case,

20:24.190 --> 20:26.857
you work the cold case,
Colton's death.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.793
And I won't post
any episodes of "Recovered"

20:28.828 --> 20:31.596
until we know what
we're dealing with here.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.065
If we're lucky, the cold case
will take us straight

20:34.100 --> 20:36.634
to Gil's killer.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.706
I texted Mary this morning, and
they're still holding Jackson.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.041
Can they do that?
Without charges?

20:44.077 --> 20:46.043
(both) 72 hours.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.311
Someone watches procedurals.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.579
I'll try and get a statement
from the Sheriff,

20:48.615 --> 20:49.981
but they're definitely going
to be a no comment

20:50.049 --> 20:51.082
until they press charges.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.717
Didn't you have an appointment
set up?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.385
Virginia Macklin herself.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.853
Who's that?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.288
The matriarch of the family
who founded the whole town.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.457
And known card cheat.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.157
Bridge.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.792
Low stakes, but still.

21:01.861 --> 21:02.727
Duly noted.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.262
Listen, after that,

21:04.330 --> 21:05.529
I'm going to need to get some
real estate transaction data.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.831
Are you on?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.499
Yeah. Uh, my wife's cousin
Wanda's sister-in-law.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.234
She works at the City Hall
here so no problem.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.003
Is this whole state
six degrees of Chuck?

21:12.038 --> 21:14.639
No. Chuck's family maybe,
not so much of Chuck.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.707
Hey, are you free to do
the soil patrol with me?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.342
I need to get a sample
for the horticulturist.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.810
Mm, yeah, absolutely.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.779
Awesome.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.981
<i> So, how long have Mary</i>
<i> and Jackson been married?</i>

21:24.017 --> 21:25.149
About three years.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.984
And Caitlyn is Mary's child
or Jackson's?

21:27.020 --> 21:29.220
Jackson's. He and his
first wife adopted her.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.688
Okay, well, this time
I'm going to get

21:30.723 --> 21:33.057
a legible picture
of that will.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.692
I'll get a sample
of the stinky soil.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.493
I'm gonna find Mary.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.461
Back here, 30 minutes.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.607
We need a deposit
for the funeral home

21:49.642 --> 21:54.045
and I can't figure out
which account...

21:54.080 --> 21:54.879
Oh!

21:54.947 --> 21:55.946
Mary.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.784
There is so much to do.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.052
They won't let me
see Jackson yet.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.920
Well, when I saw him,
he was all right,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.955
but we do need a good
criminal attorney.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.091
Don't you worry about anything.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.926
<i> I'll take care of it.</i>

22:08.961 --> 22:10.628
Oh, hello Alex.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.196
Thank you for coming
this morning.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.365
Yeah, no, I'm glad that
you're glad to see me.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.499
I do want to help.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.901
Eileen and I talked,
and she's right,

22:16.936 --> 22:19.070
I can't do anything
for Jackson right now.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.439
But... if what happened to Gil
is connected to Colton's death,

22:21.507 --> 22:23.808
then anything you need,
I'll try to help.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.944
I'll go over the case again,
take a fresh look at everything.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.113
Oh, and you might want to take
a harder look at Andy Wood.

22:29.182 --> 22:32.550
I always thought the sheriff
moved off him too fast.

22:48.234 --> 22:52.203
It's for sale. Do you think
Andy Wood's moved?

22:52.238 --> 22:53.337
His truck's still here.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.905
Let's see if he's home.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.273
[knocking]

22:56.309 --> 22:58.676
I'm surprised he didn't move
after Colton fired him.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.679
He could've been charged
with theft.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.714
<i> That's a lot of mail.</i>

23:03.783 --> 23:06.150
I'm gonna leave him my card.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.393
<i> We can go?</i>

23:15.428 --> 23:16.794
Yeah.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.264
<i> Off to the Chaberton Estate.</i>

23:24.337 --> 23:25.002
May I?

23:25.071 --> 23:26.637
Oh, yes, thank you.

23:26.706 --> 23:30.040
Oh, no, thank you for taking
time to meet with me.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.976
Somebody raised you right.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.310
[laughs]

23:33.346 --> 23:34.512
My mother would be happy
to hear that.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.080
[laughs]

23:36.115 --> 23:39.216
Now, Mrs. Macklin, when is it
that your family settled here?

23:39.252 --> 23:42.853
Oh, we founded this town,
in 1804.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.288
Wow.

23:44.323 --> 23:47.725
And it was the Macklins,
the Kellehers, the Davies.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.528
It was around 12 families
back then.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.529
Mmhmm.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.497
All of them tended
their own farms.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.065
There must be some families
that still tend farms?

23:55.101 --> 23:58.202
No. No, factory farms now.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.336
No families.

23:59.372 --> 24:00.838
Hmm.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.407
So when is it that you noticed
that changes began to occur?

24:03.443 --> 24:07.945
Within the '60s, my father sold
the first parcel of land,

24:08.014 --> 24:11.282
which, uh, was the biggest
mistake our family ever made.

24:11.317 --> 24:14.618
I think, you know, if we hadn't
gone down that road,

24:14.654 --> 24:16.220
maybe things would
be different now.

24:16.255 --> 24:17.421
Hmm.

24:17.490 --> 24:20.558
We sold a parcel of land
to the Sauniers.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.426
We... we thought
it was worthless,

24:22.462 --> 24:24.295
and yet it grew their grapes.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.963
And look at them now.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.998
And then look at Macklin.

24:28.034 --> 24:31.969
Do you know you have to dodge
tour buses if you want

24:32.004 --> 24:34.038
to cross any street downtown?

24:34.073 --> 24:36.240
Hmm.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.510
Do you think that'll be enough
for him to figure it out?

24:39.545 --> 24:41.745
I don't know, but I literally
had to army crawl through

24:41.781 --> 24:43.881
like three sets of barbed wire
to get this.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.115
Wow.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.684
Not really, but it felt like
that a little bit.

24:46.719 --> 24:47.351
I see.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.719
Did you...

24:48.788 --> 24:49.720
I just... I just had to hand dig
a little bit actually.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.288
It was okay, it was
pretty easy.

24:52.892 --> 24:56.193
Excuse me, are you Ryan?

24:56.229 --> 24:57.561
You must be Alex.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.663
Yeah, Alex McPherson,
and this is Chuck Matthews.

24:59.699 --> 25:00.865
We work together.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.166
General assistant.

25:02.235 --> 25:04.134
Step into my lab, let's see
what's on the slab.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.603
Uh...

25:06.672 --> 25:07.638
[exhales dramatically]

25:07.673 --> 25:08.706
Oh boy.

25:08.774 --> 25:09.974
Do you have a soil sample?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.675
Oh. Yeah, here you go.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.144
It's from as close to the
property line as I could get.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.346
Where did this come from?

25:15.381 --> 25:16.547
The Chaberton Vineyard?

25:16.582 --> 25:18.015
Well, they shouldn't
even be there.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.150
Nothing should sit that close
to the delicate biospheres

25:20.186 --> 25:21.352
in Fernhead Creek.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.222
Well, they seem like
responsible growers.

25:25.258 --> 25:26.824
It doesn't smell responsible.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.526
Well, it's more likely from
the neighbour down the hill.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.160
Their drainage fed directly
into the vineyard's

25:30.196 --> 25:31.328
irrigation system, so...

25:31.397 --> 25:34.765
It's still their responsibility
to clean up.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.400
[slams table with soil sample]

25:36.469 --> 25:38.502
I'm sorry.

25:38.538 --> 25:39.970
Truth is, I won't be happy

25:40.006 --> 25:42.406
until half this county goes back
to being hardwood forest.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.675
Uncultivated land.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.010
What am I looking for?

25:46.045 --> 25:48.012
Can you break down what's there
and see if it's just

25:48.047 --> 25:52.383
bad farming practice, or
something more deliberate?

25:52.418 --> 25:55.686
You suspect foul play?

25:55.721 --> 25:58.923
Yes, I realize how that sounded
the minute it left my mouth.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.324
I just want to be thorough.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.792
I can be thorough.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.360
But you'll have to come back
to see me again.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.863
It's going to take 24 hours to
get the full chemical rundown.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.464
Yeah, we can come back.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.933
Um... and you have my number.

26:08.968 --> 26:09.733
I do.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.401
'Kay.

26:10.436 --> 26:11.402
[recorder beeps]

26:14.407 --> 26:17.041
I can come back... or not.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.442
Look, I may not be a detective,
but for some things,

26:18.477 --> 26:20.377
you don't have to be.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.812
[embarrassed]
Chuck!

26:21.881 --> 26:22.780
Just sayin'.

26:22.848 --> 26:23.714
[telephone ringing]

26:23.749 --> 26:24.682
No, no.

26:24.717 --> 26:25.983
<i> Hello?</i>

26:26.018 --> 26:27.217
<i> It's me.</i>

26:27.286 --> 26:29.620
Why are we on the phone?
A call leaves a trail.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.654
<i> I need to get paid.</i>

26:30.723 --> 26:32.222
You said you would get
out of town.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.591
That's what you said
would happen.

26:33.659 --> 26:36.226
<i> I can't go without my money,</i>
<i> and that's on you.</i>

26:36.295 --> 26:38.095
<i> Or I start talking.</i>

26:51.444 --> 26:53.744
Are you sure you looked
in the right spot?

26:53.813 --> 26:55.045
Yeah, it is gone.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.614
Right, but you think that
someone shot Gil

26:56.649 --> 26:58.582
just to get that?

26:58.618 --> 26:59.984
Jacke of it.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.919
Right, but did they know
that the will even existed?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.020
That I don't know.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.521
Gil said that he found it
a week ago

27:04.557 --> 27:05.656
and that there was
only one copy,

27:05.691 --> 27:07.124
but maybe there's more.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.360
Hmm.

27:09.428 --> 27:12.229
Are there hard drives in there?

27:12.264 --> 27:13.764
Right here.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.500
Those are from a security camera
from the night that Colton died.

27:16.535 --> 27:17.768
Well, that should tell you
a lot.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.737
It says that they were
wiped clean.

27:19.772 --> 27:23.207
That does tell you a lot.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.976
Okay, how was this ruled
an accident?

27:26.012 --> 27:28.512
Sheriff makes a note here that
he has a meeting with Jackson,

27:28.581 --> 27:30.447
November 3rd at 3:00 PM.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.782
No notes on the meeting,

27:31.851 --> 27:34.318
and then the file's closed
at 3:30.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.619
That's shady.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.654
Mmhmm.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.525
You know, we gotta get
this up on the... board,

27:41.560 --> 27:43.193
that we don't have.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.395
Yeah, we need more space-

27:44.430 --> 27:45.729
<i> Yes.</i>

27:45.798 --> 27:47.264
<i> -you know? I wonder if</i>
<i> this place has a basement?</i>

27:47.299 --> 27:50.401
Okay, so... play it out.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.936
Colton went to clean
a vat at 5:00 PM,

27:53.005 --> 27:58.575
and Mary found his body at 7:30,
when he was late for dinner.

27:58.611 --> 28:01.879
And where was everyone
during that time?

28:01.914 --> 28:05.115
Okay, well, Gil was
in the vineyard working.

28:05.151 --> 28:05.983
Mmhmm.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.418
And he has tons of witnesses.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.387
Caitlyn says that she was
studying alone.

28:10.423 --> 28:11.922
Mmhmm.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.391
And then there's Mary, whose
whereabouts are unaccounted for,

28:14.460 --> 28:17.127
and then Jackson had left
the property at noon that day.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.128
[loud scraping]

28:18.164 --> 28:19.863
Chuck?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.098
[groaning]

28:21.133 --> 28:21.932
That is heavy.

28:22.001 --> 28:22.833
What?

28:22.868 --> 28:24.334
Stop it.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.369
[exhales heavily]

28:25.438 --> 28:26.670
Where'd you get this?

28:26.706 --> 28:27.671
Oh, Wanda's cousin's
sister-in-law's husband's

28:27.740 --> 28:28.906
a teacher.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.407
I know how much you guys
like your crimey boards,

28:30.443 --> 28:32.509
but I have to have it back for
his Wednesday Spanish class.

28:32.545 --> 28:35.045
Oh, um, vámonos
Thank you.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.480
Let's get it in here.
Here I'll help you.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.114
That's amazing!

28:37.149 --> 28:38.282
Oh, you got that?

28:38.317 --> 28:41.518
Ya. Here. You just...
put that over there.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.988
Okay, here, I'll pull out
what happened

28:45.024 --> 28:46.523
after Colton's death?

28:46.592 --> 28:49.059
Okay, well their main suspect,
their only suspect,

28:49.095 --> 28:50.594
was Andy Woods.

28:50.663 --> 28:53.063
He says he was playing darts in
a tournament in town that night,

28:53.132 --> 28:55.032
but no one saw him until 8:30.

28:55.101 --> 28:55.966
Hmm.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.000
No alibi.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.736
Exactly.

28:58.771 --> 29:03.207
Um, 'kay, then there's this
sheriff's report on Ryan Abbey.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.477
He was arrested for trespassing
the night that Colton died.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.312
Oh, that's your Ryan.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.012
What?

29:09.048 --> 29:09.947
Your Ryan?

29:10.015 --> 29:10.748
Yeah.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.516
No, he... he's not.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.518
He's a... Ryan Abbey's
a horticulturalist,

29:14.587 --> 29:18.222
and he gives quite an intense
statement to the police.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.256
Read that.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.591
Huh.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.626
"The Saunier family are defilers
of the land

29:22.661 --> 29:25.763
"who should be run
out of town on a rail."

29:25.798 --> 29:27.231
Your Ryan?

29:27.266 --> 29:30.033
Okay, look, he's just examining
the polluted soil,

29:30.069 --> 29:31.502
the sample that Chuck got...

29:31.537 --> 29:32.736
Oh.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.939
Okay, well, I'll run a
background check on him,

29:35.975 --> 29:37.207
and you know,
everybody here,

29:37.243 --> 29:39.443
just to make sure we got
everything up to speed.

29:39.512 --> 29:40.844
'Kay.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.084
Hard drives?
What do we do with these?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.385
Oh, I don't even know
why Gil kept those.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.553
They're blank now.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.855
Not to Owen.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.257
I don't follow.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.959
Sorry, uh, hard drives are never
fully scrubbed clean.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.595
Owen is a friend of mine,
he's a tech wizard,

29:58.664 --> 30:00.564
works with law enforcement
sometimes.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.132
He could probably restore those.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.534
<i> That is amazing.</i>

30:07.606 --> 30:08.772
Caitlyn?

30:08.841 --> 30:10.073
She's Jackson's
adopted daughter.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.809
She doesn't have an alibi
for either murder.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.478
She was on the scene already
when we found Gil's body.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.413
She stands to lose as much
as Jackson.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.549
Maybe she's working with him?

30:18.584 --> 30:23.020
You know, I think we should
probably go with...

30:23.088 --> 30:25.455
Ryan Abbey.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.523
Uh, why?

30:26.559 --> 30:27.758
I dunno, he just seems like
a zealot

30:27.827 --> 30:29.660
with a bit of an axe to grind.

30:29.695 --> 30:30.661
[phone notification]

30:30.696 --> 30:32.029
Oh, what's that?

30:32.097 --> 30:34.498
Owen says that he can take
a look at the hard drives

30:34.567 --> 30:35.632
if we can get them
to him right away.

30:35.701 --> 30:36.533
Well, where is he?

30:36.569 --> 30:38.202
Pittsburgh.

30:38.771 --> 30:39.703
Chuck.

30:39.738 --> 30:40.704
Is that me? I feel like
that's me.

30:40.773 --> 30:41.538
That's you, I think.

30:41.607 --> 30:42.940
You guys need anything else?

30:42.975 --> 30:43.674
Well, I'm sure we will,
but this is pretty important.

30:43.742 --> 30:44.374
Thank you.

30:44.410 --> 30:45.576
Great.

30:45.611 --> 30:46.210
I'll text you the address
right now, okay?

30:46.245 --> 30:46.944
Copy that.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.345
Great.

30:56.689 --> 30:59.022
"Vat room, help!"

30:59.058 --> 31:02.192
Yeah, yeah, could you
uh, work this latch?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.228
Really? That gets "help"
with an exclamation mark?

31:04.263 --> 31:06.129
What, are you saying
you can't do it?

31:06.198 --> 31:07.531
Ooh.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.803
[groans]

31:12.838 --> 31:14.104
Good. Okay.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.105
Okay.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.273
Now, how could you close
that latch

31:16.342 --> 31:17.507
and the three vents manually,

31:17.543 --> 31:19.209
before Colton knows
what you're up to?

31:19.278 --> 31:19.977
No, you can't.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.511
Okay.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.580
The other option is to override
the computer's warning system

31:23.616 --> 31:25.515
and have it automatically close
them all at the same time.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.452
Mmhmm, mmhmm.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.188
Oh, I'm sorry,
am I "it" today?

31:31.257 --> 31:32.489
I feel like a lab rat.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.857
Well, I tried, but it took me
20 minutes

31:33.893 --> 31:35.525
and I had to look online.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.760
Okay, let's just say
that I could do it

31:36.829 --> 31:37.628
in probably half that time.

31:37.663 --> 31:38.528
Still wouldn't be fast enough.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.830
Right.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.632
Well, it has to be someone
who knows the equipment

31:41.667 --> 31:45.669
and who can move quickly, so...
who does that rule out?

31:45.704 --> 31:47.537
No one?

31:47.573 --> 31:48.705
This person probably is the one

31:48.774 --> 31:53.143
that also scrambled
the security footage.

31:53.212 --> 31:57.514
Hey... but there's a security
camera facing Gil's office door,

31:57.549 --> 31:59.283
and it would have picked up
whoever went into Gil's office

31:59.318 --> 32:02.052
after he died and
took the new will.

32:02.087 --> 32:02.719
Hmm.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.521
[sighs]

32:04.556 --> 32:06.056
You're welcome.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.191
Well, I gotta go meet
with the property developer,

32:08.227 --> 32:09.493
catch up with you later.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.527
Yeah.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.697
You'll receive another
intriguing text.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.900
<i> Oh, I hope so.</i>

32:21.607 --> 32:24.207
Can I help you?

32:24.243 --> 32:25.742
Caitlyn.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.278
Uh, I was just looking
at some footage.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.613
Sure.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.248
Mary said we should do anything
we can to help you.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.550
I didn't want to bother
any of you today.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.818
How are you holding up?

32:34.853 --> 32:37.120
I may be losing half
my family this year, so...

32:37.156 --> 32:39.423
not great.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.557
Did you find what you needed?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.192
Actually, I'm... I'm good.

32:42.227 --> 32:43.760
Here, let me do it.

32:43.829 --> 32:46.163
Which camera did you need?

32:46.198 --> 32:48.198
Oh, I um, I got
the right camera.

32:48.267 --> 32:51.702
Uh... I was just wondering
if I could zoom in.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.370
[keyboard clicking]

32:56.608 --> 33:00.410
Yeah. I... I need
a copy of that.

33:00.446 --> 33:03.981
[keyboard clicking]

33:04.016 --> 33:07.384
Oh no, I... hit
the wrong button.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.053
Sorry, it's gone.

33:10.089 --> 33:13.156
Well, I just found out that
it's possible to retrieve

33:13.192 --> 33:15.726
all the data from almost
any hard drive,

33:15.794 --> 33:19.629
so if I could have it, I can
get it all cleaned up.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.431
[nervously]
Sure.

33:21.467 --> 33:25.402
I'm not sure we have
a replacement though.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.271
I noticed these earlier.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.907
This one looks brand new.

33:30.943 --> 33:31.908
It is.

33:38.951 --> 33:40.784
Thank you.

33:43.422 --> 33:46.923
Well, I hope Eileen
is having better luck.

33:57.903 --> 34:02.072
Is this a... wow.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.208
Hmm?

34:08.781 --> 34:10.380
Yeah.

34:31.170 --> 34:34.137
Backstory...

34:39.845 --> 34:42.679
Sharp shooting champion?

34:44.383 --> 34:48.518
Football, volleyball...
sh-

34:48.554 --> 34:50.353
Wow!

35:09.641 --> 35:12.142
"Flying Fists Sheriff Station?"

35:12.211 --> 35:13.710
Oh, you're not going
to want to miss this.

35:13.745 --> 35:14.411
Oh really?

35:14.446 --> 35:15.712
So, context?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.180
Whose fists?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.349
Well, Donna Kelleher's and
someone in the Saunier's family.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.318
And apparently gunshots
were fired.

35:21.386 --> 35:22.919
I'm just waiting here,
I'm gonna ask the sheriff.

35:22.955 --> 35:25.322
Where'd you pick up
this local commentary?

35:25.357 --> 35:26.723
Real estate developer
I was talking to,

35:26.792 --> 35:28.525
he said that the Kelleher's
the last ones to hold out

35:28.594 --> 35:31.862
in the county, so apparently
the rest of the farms were

35:31.897 --> 35:34.331
sold to Benson Holdings.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.832
Who's Benson Holdings?

35:35.868 --> 35:36.967
I don't know, but I'm going
to dig around and find out...

35:37.002 --> 35:38.201
Oh, Sheriff, I just
wanted to...

35:38.270 --> 35:39.970
Not now.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.439
Jackson should be home
right now, you know it.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.342
Jackson's lawyer spoke to the
DA and he said that the autopsy

35:45.377 --> 35:48.178
showed that it was a long-range
bullet that killed Gil,

35:48.213 --> 35:49.646
maybe even from below.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.114
Which couldn't possibly
be Jackson.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.115
Unless he worked
with someone.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.750
Mary, he failed the polygraph.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.552
<i> (Lustig) One that he should</i>
<i> never have taken.</i>

35:55.621 --> 35:56.453
It was voluntary.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.521
You can't just keep him here.

35:57.589 --> 35:58.989
Well, they have another
two days

35:59.024 --> 36:00.490
before they have to file
a charge.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.125
We're still investigating, so
I have a lot of work to do.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.660
So, if you don't mind...

36:03.695 --> 36:04.561
But, but wait, I... I... I have
some things I want to leave

36:04.596 --> 36:05.562
for my husband.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.863
Just toiletries.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.598
All right. Come on back
and let's get 'em cleared.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.034
Mary, I'll... I'll call you
this evening.

36:13.105 --> 36:15.005
Don't publish any of that.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.840
Please.

36:16.875 --> 36:20.076
We don't print
incomplete stories.

36:20.112 --> 36:24.147
But, we can help you
if you want to help us.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.287
Jackson and Gil were close.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.422
I mean, the idea that Jackson
would hurt Gil

36:32.491 --> 36:34.724
is just ridiculous.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.826
They were a good compliment
to each other,

36:36.862 --> 36:39.296
and the winery
was a great success.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.764
With your help.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.800
I advised on uh, investments
and long-term planning, yes.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.136
You recruited Jackson
to attend your college, right?

36:46.171 --> 36:47.304
I did.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.438
And when he invited
me back to Chaberton,

36:48.473 --> 36:50.207
well, it just felt like home.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.241
It's been that way ever since.

36:51.276 --> 36:52.909
But you became very close
to Colton.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.211
I did.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.346
In fact, you handled
all of his legal affairs,

36:56.415 --> 36:57.914
including personal and business?

36:57.950 --> 36:59.316
As far as I know, yes.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.018
You helped him with his will?

37:02.054 --> 37:03.853
[hesitantly] Yes of...
of course.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.288
Recently?

37:05.324 --> 37:07.424
Oh no, no, no, we did that
years ago, and...

37:07.459 --> 37:10.060
[phone buzzes]

37:10.095 --> 37:11.261
I'm sorry.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.163
Um, I've gotta go, I've got...
got a meeting.

37:13.198 --> 37:14.064
Of course.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.165
Thank you for your time.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.600
You're welcome.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.771
I don't know.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.540
I get the feeling he didn't know
anything about a new will.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.642
No. Colton definitely used
a different lawyer.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.277
The question is, why?

37:27.312 --> 37:29.112
Well, someone killed Colton
to prevent that new will

37:29.181 --> 37:30.547
from being signed.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.249
It's because they wanted to make
sure the original will

37:32.317 --> 37:34.317
was in effect.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.986
[sighs]

37:36.154 --> 37:38.221
<i> Jackson's family stood</i>
<i> to lose everything.</i>

37:38.257 --> 37:40.323
<i> I saw Mary on the security</i>
<i> footage,</i>

37:40.359 --> 37:42.192
leaving Gil's office
on the night he died.

37:42.227 --> 37:45.262
So, she could've taken
the new will.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.264
When I asked Caitlyn to help me
make a copy,

37:47.299 --> 37:49.532
she "accidentally" deleted it.

37:49.568 --> 37:50.834
I did get the hard drive,

37:50.869 --> 37:52.068
do you think we could still
get that to Owen?

37:52.137 --> 37:53.670
Yes, I can try.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.139
[phone notification]

37:56.174 --> 37:58.575
Oh, it's Ryan.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.043
Your Ryan?

38:00.078 --> 38:01.144
Yeah, he has a... pfft.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.113
He has answers
on the soil sample.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.581
He says I can come
by anytime.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.649
Oh, great, yes, let's do that.

38:05.684 --> 38:06.750
You do not have to come.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.717
I am coming.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.552
Chuck said he's intense,

38:09.588 --> 38:11.321
and besides, I got a background
check on him.

38:11.356 --> 38:11.855
Oh, really?

38:11.890 --> 38:12.789
Yeah.

38:12.824 --> 38:13.523
Any skeletons?

38:13.592 --> 38:14.958
Yeah. Trust fund baby.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.326
Family comes from big money.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.594
So he's a rich guy trying
to make the world

38:17.629 --> 38:20.530
a better place, and that's
a threat to me how?

38:20.565 --> 38:21.398
I'm going.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.632
[laughs]

38:22.668 --> 38:24.267
Eye roll.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.672
Oh, hi Ryan.

38:28.707 --> 38:29.406
Ms. McPherson.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.974
Yeah. And uh, this is...

38:31.009 --> 38:33.043
Drew Godfrey. Also
Herrington Chronicle.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.612
You mind if I record again?

38:35.647 --> 38:36.713
Please do.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.081
[beep]

38:38.116 --> 38:40.083
So, tell me about the soil
sample that you analyzed.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.118
Well, it's saturated
with leachate,

38:42.154 --> 38:43.920
a bi-product of untreated
animal waste.

38:43.955 --> 38:44.954
So that means
it's not intentional,

38:44.990 --> 38:47.057
it's just bad animal husbandry.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.658
Well, it's no accident it's
going into the vineyard's

38:48.694 --> 38:49.859
irrigation system.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.561
Leachate is classified
as a biohazard

38:51.630 --> 38:52.929
and it's worse than ever.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.931
Donna Kelleher is breaking
the law,

38:54.966 --> 38:56.232
and it's a good law.

38:56.268 --> 38:58.368
So what's the penalty
for creating a biohazard?

38:58.403 --> 39:01.538
Could be time in jail,
hundreds of thousands in fines,

39:01.606 --> 39:03.740
and it still wouldn't be good
enough for either of them.

39:03.775 --> 39:04.607
Either of them?

39:04.643 --> 39:06.876
Miss Kelleher or the Sauniers.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.545
They squabbled about this
for over a year now,

39:08.580 --> 39:10.647
while the land keeps getting
more and more poisoned.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.649
They should all just go to jail.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.287
At any rate, that's my report.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.556
I'm available to give
expert testimony.

39:19.624 --> 39:22.325
Um, Ryan? Just one second.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.993
Did you say that the soil
is getting worse?

39:24.062 --> 39:28.064
Does that mean that you have
tested the vineyard soil before?

39:28.100 --> 39:30.633
I have... taken a look.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.035
That's what you were doing
on the property

39:32.070 --> 39:35.305
the day that Colton
Saunier died.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.340
This interview is over.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.345
[recorder beeps]

39:45.517 --> 39:49.219
What a sweet, laid back guy.

39:49.287 --> 39:50.920
Fireman Shawn should be worried.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.555
[laughs]
Stop it.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.391
No, I guess not, since you kind
of nailed him on his whereabouts

39:54.426 --> 39:56.426
for possible murder.

39:56.495 --> 40:00.029
Yeah, I guess he won't want
to date me now.

40:00.098 --> 40:03.533
So I guess we'll go see
Donna Kelleher?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.702
Yeah. How'd you know?

40:05.737 --> 40:08.772
Because... you.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.039
Right.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.408
Is this some
Uncle Miles move,

40:11.443 --> 40:12.542
you're just doing this
to protect me?

40:12.577 --> 40:13.877
Protect you?

40:13.912 --> 40:15.845
I hope you're gonna
have my back.

40:22.821 --> 40:25.188
<i> (Alex) That must be</i>
<i> the house there.</i>

40:26.591 --> 40:27.957
<i> Huh.</i>

40:41.840 --> 40:43.673
Huh.

40:48.313 --> 40:49.913
<i> Wow.</i>

40:49.948 --> 40:51.581
<i> How did that happen?</i>

40:51.616 --> 40:53.917
Oh. You know, the developer
I talked to

40:53.952 --> 40:56.419
said that she's got money
from somewhere.

40:56.455 --> 40:57.387
[shotgun cocking]

40:57.456 --> 40:59.422
Turn around real slow.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.761
You folks get lost?

41:04.830 --> 41:06.296
No, Ma'am.

41:06.331 --> 41:09.933
We... we were just... hoping
to speak to you, Ms. Kelleher.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.135
I don't talk to the press.

41:12.204 --> 41:14.571
Get in your car and go.

41:14.606 --> 41:17.440
Don't come back.

41:17.476 --> 41:18.308
'Kay.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.276
Got it.

41:20.312 --> 41:21.778
How did she know
we're press?

41:21.813 --> 41:23.213
Good question.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.785
She's very welcoming.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.253
She stands her ground.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.054
Yes, she does.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.422
I respect that.

41:32.457 --> 41:33.756
Well, I'm gonna go straight
to the sheriff

41:33.825 --> 41:36.226
and see what we can find out
about Mrs. Kelleher.

41:36.294 --> 41:37.260
Yeah.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.100
Thank you for understanding.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.568
I'm sure we can reschedule...

41:45.604 --> 41:46.603
Yes, we have your number.

41:46.638 --> 41:47.937
If you just uh,
give me some dates.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.672
Someone will get in touch
with you for the refund.

41:49.708 --> 41:50.507
Thank you.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.175
Thank you so much.

41:54.579 --> 41:55.712
[sighs]

41:55.747 --> 41:57.347
[sighs]

41:57.382 --> 41:59.415
Thank goodness Colton
wasn't here to see this.

41:59.484 --> 42:01.484
There'd be some way this
was all my fault.

42:01.520 --> 42:05.922
Well, no one can blame you
for this, Mary.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.825
Would you like some wine,
Eileen?

42:08.860 --> 42:12.195
It has to be five o'clock
somewhere.

42:12.264 --> 42:14.297
I have a special bottle of Rosé
hidden away.

42:14.332 --> 42:17.333
Ooh.

42:17.369 --> 42:20.336
Oh, maybe Caitlyn can join us.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.472
Uh, she's out.

42:51.336 --> 42:52.969
The police have it.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.671
Have what?

42:54.706 --> 42:56.406
Jackson's gun.

42:56.441 --> 43:00.243
I bought it for him last year,
but the truth is,

43:00.278 --> 43:02.145
he's never liked to shoot
or hunt.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.847
Um, I thought if he gave it
a try,

43:04.883 --> 43:07.784
it would give him and Gil
something else to do together.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.752
Well, it's nice that you wanted
Jackson and Gil

43:09.788 --> 43:11.287
to have more time.

43:11.323 --> 43:14.624
All he ever wanted was peace
in this house.

43:14.693 --> 43:17.794
Help us get that for you, Mary.

43:17.829 --> 43:19.696
Is there anything that you can
think of?

43:19.764 --> 43:22.298
No matter how small.

43:22.367 --> 43:25.201
That'll help Jackson.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.937
Can... you call Alex
and ask her to come here?

45:13.878 --> 45:15.712
I lied to the sheriff.

45:15.780 --> 45:19.248
I was in the vat room
that day earlier than I said.

45:19.284 --> 45:22.418
I saw someone sneak out
the back.

45:22.487 --> 45:25.254
I saw a shadow and I heard
the door slam.

45:25.290 --> 45:28.057
I followed outside uh,
into the vineyard,

45:28.093 --> 45:32.361
and then I saw the back door
at the Kelleher farm slam,

45:32.397 --> 45:34.363
like someone had just run in.

45:34.399 --> 45:39.602
So why didn't you tell anyone
about this then?

45:39.637 --> 45:42.371
They already looked at me
like I'd done it.

45:42.407 --> 45:45.341
Gil flat out accused me and...

45:45.376 --> 45:47.810
who would believe me
that I saw a shadow

45:47.879 --> 45:49.512
that might've been there?

45:49.547 --> 45:51.013
I just thought it would look
like I was trying

45:51.049 --> 45:52.782
to throw suspicion off myself.

45:52.817 --> 45:59.388
Do you remember any specifics,
any details about the... shadow?

45:59.424 --> 46:02.225
[sighs]

46:02.293 --> 46:05.361
There might've been a hat.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.764
[phone rings]

46:07.799 --> 46:12.368
Oh, this is Jackson's lawyer,
um... Excuse me.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.104
Hello?

46:15.140 --> 46:18.274
[whispers] Do you believe that?
What is going on?

46:18.309 --> 46:19.709
I don't know.

46:19.744 --> 46:21.744
But I did find a few
things out earlier.

46:21.813 --> 46:22.645
What?

46:22.680 --> 46:24.147
Let me show you,
hold on.

46:24.182 --> 46:25.515
[phone buzzes]

46:25.583 --> 46:26.616
Oh, Drew's here.

46:26.651 --> 46:28.518
Uh, out front.

46:28.553 --> 46:29.719
Hold that thought,
I'll go get him.

46:29.754 --> 46:31.454
Well, take the shortcut,
go through the vat room.

46:31.489 --> 46:32.889
Okay.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.257
So if you take that little
hallway there to the right.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.625
Go there and then left.

46:35.660 --> 46:37.426
Right and then left.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.061
Yeah.

47:11.563 --> 47:14.430
[pipes hissing]

47:14.465 --> 47:16.899
[coughing]

47:19.304 --> 47:20.303
[pounds on door]

47:22.440 --> 47:23.673
Hello?

47:23.741 --> 47:24.607
Hi.

47:24.642 --> 47:27.276
Uh, Drew Godfrey.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.846
I... work with Alex.

47:29.881 --> 47:30.980
I'm meeting her here.

47:31.015 --> 47:31.948
I haven't seen her.

47:31.983 --> 47:33.816
Oh. Do you mind
if I look around?

47:33.885 --> 47:35.284
Sure.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.285
Thanks.

47:39.958 --> 47:42.892
[muffled coughing]

47:52.337 --> 47:55.304
[choking]

47:58.042 --> 47:59.308
[text alert]

47:59.344 --> 48:02.011
"Vat room help!  Seriously!!!"

48:02.080 --> 48:04.847
Three exclamation marks.

48:04.883 --> 48:07.650
[alarm wailing]

48:10.288 --> 48:11.087
Alex?

48:11.122 --> 48:13.055
[glass shattering]

48:13.091 --> 48:14.590
Alex!

48:16.227 --> 48:19.195
[coughing]

48:24.235 --> 48:25.334
Alex.

48:25.370 --> 48:26.969
Help!

48:29.507 --> 48:30.706
Copy that.

48:30.742 --> 48:34.410
Take a team, fan out,
and search the property.

48:35.813 --> 48:37.680
So who, uh, turned off
the ammonia?

48:37.715 --> 48:39.649
I did, right after
I called for help,

48:39.684 --> 48:40.650
and I shut the door.

48:40.685 --> 48:41.851
But that's not enough.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.352
Okay, well we'll seal
the building for now,

48:43.421 --> 48:45.688
but are you sure all of
the workers got out?

48:45.723 --> 48:47.723
Fortunately, everyone
was gone for the day.

48:47.759 --> 48:50.493
I just wanna check on her.

48:50.528 --> 48:51.494
[sighs]

48:52.997 --> 48:54.630
Is she conscious yet?

48:54.666 --> 48:56.198
Just heard her cough.

48:56.234 --> 48:57.667
Man, this could've been
so much worse.

48:57.702 --> 48:59.468
Oh, just... don't even say that.

48:59.504 --> 49:03.739
[coughs]

49:03.775 --> 49:04.907
Not yet, Miss.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.709
No, take some slow,
deep breaths.

49:06.744 --> 49:07.743
[hacking]

49:07.812 --> 49:09.011
That's why you need
to take it slow.

49:09.047 --> 49:10.546
No... We have to go find them.

49:10.615 --> 49:12.982
Hey, hey.  It's okay, it's okay.
The sheriff is here, he's on it.

49:13.017 --> 49:14.483
Just let it go.
You'll tap out.

49:14.552 --> 49:15.418
No, I'm fine.

49:15.453 --> 49:16.352
We can just go right now...

49:16.387 --> 49:17.186
Just, think.

49:17.221 --> 49:18.321
[coughing]

49:18.356 --> 49:19.956
Pretend that
he's Fireman Shawn.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.691
Would you do what he says?

49:21.759 --> 49:23.726
[sighs]

49:23.761 --> 49:25.294
Relax.

49:25.363 --> 49:26.562
Do you have any hazmat?

49:26.597 --> 49:27.897
What?

49:27.966 --> 49:29.332
You know, suits, breathers?

49:29.367 --> 49:30.800
You must be prepared.

49:30.835 --> 49:32.301
In storage. Out back.

49:32.337 --> 49:33.069
I'll show you.

49:33.104 --> 49:34.136
Okay.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.081
Looks tense.

49:45.116 --> 49:46.382
Yeah.

49:46.417 --> 49:47.750
Have they told the sheriff
about the injunction.

49:47.819 --> 49:51.153
Right. Injunction.
We have to go...

49:51.189 --> 49:53.756
No, I... I was just
a little woozy, you know.

49:53.791 --> 49:54.890
I mean, that was
a lot of oxygen.

49:54.926 --> 49:55.891
Okay, well, let's just
leave that

49:55.927 --> 49:57.393
to the expert to decide that.

49:57.462 --> 49:59.829
[breathing heavily]

49:59.864 --> 50:00.796
How many fingers?

50:00.832 --> 50:02.598
Four.

50:02.633 --> 50:04.734
And we're in Macklin,
Pennsylvania.

50:04.769 --> 50:07.370
It says it right there.

50:07.405 --> 50:09.872
He is a pain.

50:09.907 --> 50:11.340
And she's back.

50:11.409 --> 50:12.375
[breathes heavily]

50:12.410 --> 50:13.876
Thank you.

50:15.480 --> 50:17.013
Hey!

50:18.783 --> 50:19.749
<i> [police radio chatter]</i>

50:19.784 --> 50:22.852
<i> What are you up to?</i>

50:22.887 --> 50:24.687
Nothing, officer.

50:24.722 --> 50:26.489
<i> Hands behind your back.</i>

50:28.526 --> 50:33.829
So tonight, we know that Caitlyn
and Mary were on the property.

50:33.865 --> 50:35.231
Right, and Ryan Abbey.

50:35.266 --> 50:36.899
Don't forget the deputy
found this charmer.

50:36.968 --> 50:38.434
Right.

50:38.469 --> 50:40.970
But Caitlyn and Andy Woods were
together tonight at his house.

50:41.005 --> 50:42.638
I saw them before I went
to Chaberton.

50:42.707 --> 50:44.106
Did she see you?

50:44.175 --> 50:45.074
I don't know.

50:45.143 --> 50:46.475
But she does seem to pop up

50:46.511 --> 50:48.944
at all the right slash wrong
moments, doesn't she?

50:48.980 --> 50:51.113
Hey, you think this kid did it?

50:51.149 --> 50:52.548
I'm not sure if she's a kid.

50:52.583 --> 50:53.983
But if she's working with Andy,

50:54.018 --> 50:55.785
I mean he certainly has a motive
for revenge

50:55.820 --> 50:57.486
against Colton and Gil.

50:57.522 --> 50:58.687
Doesn't mean she would
sign up

50:58.756 --> 51:00.222
to hurt her family.

51:00.258 --> 51:01.223
Here, I'll... I'll get that.

51:01.259 --> 51:02.892
Oh, thank you.

51:02.927 --> 51:04.660
So, who stands to inherit?

51:04.695 --> 51:07.696
If Colton and Gil are dead,
and Jackson is in jail?

51:07.765 --> 51:10.132
Well, Mary or Caitlyn
I'm guessing,

51:10.168 --> 51:11.634
but it just depends on the
will.

51:11.702 --> 51:14.036
I think it's probably Mary.

51:14.072 --> 51:15.037
You think?

51:15.073 --> 51:16.172
Maybe she's working
with Jackson.

51:16.207 --> 51:17.206
I mean, they have
the same reasons.

51:17.275 --> 51:19.942
Plus, Mary's a sharpshooter.

51:19.977 --> 51:21.677
Sorry, what?

51:21.712 --> 51:23.245
Yeah, I did some poking around.

51:23.281 --> 51:24.246
A sharpshooter?

51:24.315 --> 51:26.215
Yes, and there are
two guns missing

51:26.284 --> 51:27.817
out of the gun case
at their house.

51:27.852 --> 51:29.285
[shocked]
Wha?... Wha...

51:29.320 --> 51:30.486
Remember when I said

51:30.555 --> 51:31.687
I had something really important
to tell you?

51:31.722 --> 51:33.756
But then, you know,
he texted you,

51:33.825 --> 51:35.324
you went out of the room,
and then the ammonia...

51:35.359 --> 51:36.759
Right.

51:36.794 --> 51:38.094
And then ambulances, and
now we're getting back to it.

51:38.129 --> 51:39.128
Okay.

51:39.163 --> 51:41.063
Well, there you go,
missing guns.

51:41.099 --> 51:44.366
Right, well, police would
have Jackson's, right?

51:44.402 --> 51:45.034
Well, they do.

51:45.069 --> 51:46.202
Mary said they did.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.570
But the question is, where's
the second gun?

51:47.605 --> 51:48.437
Hmm.

51:48.473 --> 51:49.305
That is a very good question.

51:49.373 --> 51:50.639
Hey.

51:50.708 --> 51:53.642
So, success, we think, um.

51:53.678 --> 51:55.177
Owen said they're gonna
be blurry,

51:55.213 --> 51:57.346
but he will be able to pull some
images from those hard drives.

51:57.415 --> 51:59.115
He's gonna email them to you
as soon as he gets 'em.

51:59.150 --> 52:02.418
Great.

52:02.487 --> 52:03.853
Did I miss anything?

52:03.888 --> 52:05.821
I feel like I missed something.

52:05.857 --> 52:09.291
I'll... catch you up.
Just grab a seat.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.793
So what's next?

52:10.862 --> 52:14.230
Well, hopefully Caitlyn or
Mary will have more to tell me.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.632
So, I'm gonna go by there
first thing in the morning.

52:16.667 --> 52:17.500
Alone.

52:17.568 --> 52:18.968
I'm not sure that's a good idea,

52:19.036 --> 52:21.770
with the injunction against
everyone from The Chronicle.

52:21.839 --> 52:22.838
Injunction?

52:22.874 --> 52:24.607
Well, that doesn't mean me.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.108
I'm still their friend.

52:26.144 --> 52:28.043
Plus then I can look and see if
Mary hid that rifle somewhere.

52:28.079 --> 52:29.345
Rifle?

52:29.380 --> 52:30.846
And tomorrow we should check in
with the sheriff.

52:30.882 --> 52:33.649
See if he has any leads on
who poisoned me with ammonia.

52:33.684 --> 52:35.618
Ammonia?

52:35.653 --> 52:38.087
I could use a catch-up, guys.

52:38.122 --> 52:39.221
Do you need something to eat?

52:39.257 --> 52:40.556
'Cause I could use something
to eat.

52:40.591 --> 52:41.423
You know, we should all just
get something to eat.

52:41.492 --> 52:42.658
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

52:42.693 --> 52:43.459
Uh, I'm gonna call it a night.

52:43.494 --> 52:44.460
You feeling okay?

52:44.495 --> 52:45.094
Yeah.

52:45.129 --> 52:45.794
Yeah.

52:45.830 --> 52:46.962
Yeah, I'm fine.

52:46.998 --> 52:48.964
You know what? I'm gonna stay
here with you.

52:49.033 --> 52:49.832
Okay.

52:49.867 --> 52:51.367
I mean, we could go grab a beer,

52:51.402 --> 52:52.701
I could catch you up
if you wanted.

52:52.737 --> 52:53.502
Yeah.

52:53.538 --> 52:54.470
I think that's a good idea.

52:54.505 --> 52:55.104
Are you sure?

52:55.139 --> 52:56.605
Yep. Great idea.

52:56.641 --> 52:57.373
Go, enjoy.

52:57.408 --> 52:58.707
Oh, uh, but Chuck.

52:58.743 --> 53:00.976
Why don't you plan on tomorrow,
finding Andy Woods?

53:01.012 --> 53:02.845
I mean, maybe he'll turn up
in town,

53:02.880 --> 53:04.813
but you could stake out
his house, you know?

53:04.849 --> 53:06.482
He's gonna have to show up there
eventually and we need

53:06.551 --> 53:08.384
to know what's going on
with him and Caitlyn

53:08.419 --> 53:10.152
before we, uh, talk to
either one of them.

53:10.188 --> 53:11.554
Yeah, sure.

53:11.589 --> 53:13.222
It sounds a lot safer than
what's been going on here.

53:13.291 --> 53:14.423
[laughs weakly]

53:14.458 --> 53:16.058
That's for sure.

53:19.931 --> 53:21.530
You all right?

53:54.098 --> 53:56.232
Oh, hey, Eileen just texted.

53:56.267 --> 53:59.001
Mary doesn't know anything
about the injunction.

53:59.036 --> 54:00.703
Oh, Jackson, we'll ask.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.072
Yeah, the lawyer's not gonna
let us ask him anything.

54:03.107 --> 54:04.073
Right.

54:04.108 --> 54:08.077
Uh, I need to try to get
the lists

54:08.112 --> 54:09.178
of Benson Holding officers,

54:09.213 --> 54:11.013
but it's tough, you know,
it's an LLC.

54:11.048 --> 54:13.349
I bet they had to file workman's
compensation with the state.

54:13.417 --> 54:14.450
You know, you might
not get all the names,

54:14.485 --> 54:16.785
but you'd get the name
of an assistant,

54:16.854 --> 54:18.487
or address on file.

54:18.522 --> 54:19.355
[laughs]

54:19.390 --> 54:20.222
You know, we need to talk more.

54:20.291 --> 54:21.023
You're welcome.

54:21.058 --> 54:21.857
[laughs]

54:21.926 --> 54:22.791
Oh.

54:22.827 --> 54:23.759
Mr. Abbey.

54:23.794 --> 54:25.928
How are the accommodations?

54:25.963 --> 54:28.030
Jail is a badge of honour
in my work.

54:28.065 --> 54:28.797
Yeah.

54:28.833 --> 54:29.965
Is sabotage?

54:30.001 --> 54:31.500
All roads to the perfect place.

54:31.535 --> 54:32.768
You could've killed Alex.

54:32.803 --> 54:34.903
No. It wasn't me.

54:34.939 --> 54:36.605
Then, what were you doing
at the vineyard?

54:36.674 --> 54:38.140
Monitoring the Kelleher's farm.

54:38.175 --> 54:40.109
Trespassing. Spying.

54:40.144 --> 54:41.744
You make it sound like
it's a bad thing.

54:41.779 --> 54:44.413
What... what do you do
for a living again?...

54:44.448 --> 54:45.714
When's your arraignment?

54:45.750 --> 54:48.484
'Cause I want to make sure
I'm in the front row.

54:48.519 --> 54:49.718
Here.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.153
Save the date.

54:54.125 --> 54:55.424
Aw, you two are bonding.

54:55.459 --> 54:58.060
You should invite him
out to shoot pool.

54:58.129 --> 54:58.994
Yeah.

54:59.030 --> 55:00.095
More like throw darts.

55:00.131 --> 55:00.863
Yeah.

55:00.931 --> 55:03.132
Probably at 20 paces.

55:03.167 --> 55:05.034
You have got to be kidding me.

55:05.069 --> 55:06.268
What?

55:06.337 --> 55:08.470
I searched for his full name
everywhere.

55:08.506 --> 55:09.338
Look.

55:09.373 --> 55:11.807
Ryan Benson Abbey.

55:11.842 --> 55:13.542
Benson Holdings.

55:13.577 --> 55:14.710
Now, you don't know that.

55:14.745 --> 55:17.513
Your Ryan is a fraud,

55:17.548 --> 55:19.281
and he's the one who's
buying up Macklin.

55:19.317 --> 55:21.450
You are not supposed to jump
to conclusions, remember?

55:21.485 --> 55:23.452
Well, I'm jumping.

55:23.487 --> 55:24.286
You're the one
who always says that.

55:24.355 --> 55:25.187
I know.

55:25.222 --> 55:26.155
But I just, I feel it.

55:26.190 --> 55:27.189
Oh, this one time.

55:27.224 --> 55:35.030
This one time.

55:35.066 --> 55:36.465
Good morning.

55:37.835 --> 55:40.269
I'm sorry, are... are you
related to Wanda's cousin?

55:40.304 --> 55:41.303
Yeah.

55:41.339 --> 55:42.571
I... I'm Leanne.

55:42.606 --> 55:43.472
Do you know Wanda?

55:43.507 --> 55:45.741
Her sister's husband, Chuck.

55:45.776 --> 55:46.675
Chuck.

55:46.711 --> 55:49.078
Chuck is the king of karaoke.

55:49.146 --> 55:49.778
Oh.

55:49.814 --> 55:51.146
Oh.

55:51.182 --> 55:51.847
Our Christmas parties just got
40 percent more fun.

55:51.916 --> 55:52.648
[laughs]

55:52.683 --> 55:54.049
Leanne, listen.

55:54.085 --> 55:55.584
Do you know where I would
find Workman Comp Filings?

55:55.619 --> 55:57.586
All local Department
of Labour info

55:57.655 --> 55:58.821
you'll find on the second floor.

55:58.856 --> 55:59.788
Room 213.

55:59.824 --> 56:01.190
Thanks.

56:01.258 --> 56:02.725
And where would I find the
public record on wills filed

56:02.760 --> 56:03.959
in the county?

56:03.994 --> 56:05.260
Oh, uh just behind me
and around the corner.

56:05.296 --> 56:06.161
Department of Records.

56:06.197 --> 56:07.496
Thank you.

56:07.531 --> 56:08.697
Race?

56:08.733 --> 56:10.499
Race? Are you kidding me?

56:10.534 --> 56:12.501
I'm still coughing on ammonia.

56:12.570 --> 56:13.535
Go!

56:36.494 --> 56:39.495
Hi, um, excuse me, I just
have one more question.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.063
If someone passed away
last October,

56:41.098 --> 56:43.265
what would be the reason
that their will wasn't

56:43.300 --> 56:44.366
in the records?

56:44.402 --> 56:45.934
If there's some problem
with the will

56:46.003 --> 56:48.203
that can't be officially
probated.

56:48.272 --> 56:49.271
Thanks.

56:49.306 --> 56:50.406
Mmhmm.

56:50.441 --> 56:51.407
Hey.

56:51.442 --> 56:52.975
Mailing address,
place of business,

56:53.043 --> 56:55.010
and a signature on the last
page of the filings.

56:55.045 --> 56:56.812
You're right.

56:56.847 --> 56:58.680
What did you say?

56:58.716 --> 57:00.949
Ryan's rich daddy
is into real estate,

57:00.985 --> 57:03.018
and they're interlopers here
in Macklin.

57:03.053 --> 57:05.020
Okay, but it could just
be Ryan's dad, right?

57:05.055 --> 57:06.789
I mean, maybe Ryan
hates his dad,

57:06.824 --> 57:08.590
and he's just trying
to get revenge.

57:08.626 --> 57:12.294
Or he's using his super green
eco credibility as ground cover

57:12.363 --> 57:16.198
for his pop's dirty business.

57:16.233 --> 57:17.232
Maybe.

57:24.041 --> 57:25.908
Oh, come on, phone.

57:32.382 --> 57:36.518
[camera snaps]

57:40.724 --> 57:43.025
[sighs]

57:43.060 --> 57:45.227
Why don't we pick up
where we left off?

57:45.296 --> 57:47.796
Not, not yet.

57:47.832 --> 57:49.765
Okay, uh... of course.

57:49.800 --> 57:50.766
[recorder beeps]

57:54.572 --> 57:56.972
I heard you and Eileen talk
about Colton's new will

57:57.007 --> 57:59.708
the first day you were here.

57:59.743 --> 58:01.944
It sounded like a nightmare
for Jackson.

58:02.012 --> 58:03.679
He would've been so hurt.

58:03.714 --> 58:04.680
Well, Mary.

58:04.715 --> 58:06.949
I saw you on the security
footage

58:06.984 --> 58:09.918
sneaking into Gil's office
after he died.

58:09.954 --> 58:12.421
Did you take the new will?

58:12.456 --> 58:14.523
[nervously] I, I didn't want
anyone to find...

58:14.558 --> 58:16.458
it's right... here.

58:20.898 --> 58:21.864
Wait.

58:24.034 --> 58:27.569
No, I... I... I know, I know
I put it right here.

58:27.605 --> 58:28.937
Who else knew it was there?

58:28.973 --> 58:30.405
Nobody.

58:30.441 --> 58:32.007
Well, we'll, we'll find it.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.642
Look, Mary, look, stop.
Please.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.444
Just, maybe you could explain
to me what happened

58:35.479 --> 58:37.279
to the vineyard
after Colton died.

58:37.314 --> 58:41.049
Uh... The original will said
that Gil and Jackson

58:41.085 --> 58:42.384
split the winery,

58:42.419 --> 58:43.685
but they can only sell their
shares to each other,

58:43.721 --> 58:45.187
or to their children.

58:45.222 --> 58:46.622
Okay, well that seems
straightforward.

58:46.657 --> 58:49.458
So why isn't that will probated?

58:49.527 --> 58:53.862
It's... stupid paperwork.

58:53.898 --> 58:56.932
We're missing some of Colton's
shares of Chaberton.

58:56.967 --> 59:00.335
No one can find the original
stock certificates.

59:06.644 --> 59:08.277
Do you believe her?

59:08.312 --> 59:10.779
She did seem genuinely panicked
when she couldn't find it.

59:10.848 --> 59:11.980
There's something going on
with those shares.

59:12.016 --> 59:13.649
Gil mentioned them too.

59:13.684 --> 59:14.716
He said that's what
he was looking for

59:14.785 --> 59:16.184
when he found his
father's new will.

59:16.253 --> 59:17.986
[phone rings]

59:18.055 --> 59:19.922
Yeah, I mean, the bank
that holds the mortgage

59:19.957 --> 59:22.958
to my house also
has the deed, so...

59:22.993 --> 59:25.127
maybe their bank has
the stock certificates?

59:25.162 --> 59:26.595
Wouldn't they know that?

59:26.630 --> 59:28.030
Here, I gotta take this.
It's Uncle Miles.

59:28.065 --> 59:28.864
Hey, Uncle Miles.

59:28.899 --> 59:29.698
Staying out of trouble?

59:29.733 --> 59:30.732
I am.

59:30.768 --> 59:32.301
I'm at Chaberton
right now, actually,

59:32.336 --> 59:35.237
and no one here seems to know
anything about the injunction.

59:35.272 --> 59:36.738
Jim Crowley told me he got his
marching orders

59:36.774 --> 59:38.273
from a Victor Lustig.

59:38.309 --> 59:40.242
'Kay.

59:40.277 --> 59:41.009
How are things there?

59:41.045 --> 59:42.010
[dog barks]

59:42.046 --> 59:42.711
[laughs]

59:42.780 --> 59:43.946
Hi, Hearst.

59:43.981 --> 59:45.280
Hope you're keeping everyone
in check for me.

59:45.316 --> 59:46.748
Yeah, he misses you.

59:46.784 --> 59:48.584
Come home soon, okay?

59:48.619 --> 59:49.618
Will do.

59:51.789 --> 59:53.622
There we go, boy.
Good boy.

59:53.657 --> 59:55.624
<i> "Legal shenanigans located."</i>

59:55.659 --> 59:58.627
Okay, not my best, but I knew
you'd want to be a part of this.

59:58.696 --> 1:00:02.631
My secretary Jennifer
said you would be in here.

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:03.699
Can I help you?

1:00:03.767 --> 1:00:05.233
We hope so.

1:00:05.269 --> 1:00:07.235
I'm curious why you threatened
The Chronicle and my podcast

1:00:07.271 --> 1:00:08.737
with legal action.

1:00:08.772 --> 1:00:11.306
Well, I was acting on behalf
of the Saunier family.

1:00:11.342 --> 1:00:12.541
Which part, exactly?

1:00:12.610 --> 1:00:13.775
Mary knows nothing about it.

1:00:13.811 --> 1:00:15.877
Jackson didn't ask you
to shut us down, did he?

1:00:15.913 --> 1:00:17.346
You decided.

1:00:17.381 --> 1:00:20.215
I would never do something
in the Saunier name on my own.

1:00:20.250 --> 1:00:22.217
So, it was Caitlyn?

1:00:22.286 --> 1:00:26.488
I'm sorry, it's really not for
me to say anything at this time

1:00:26.523 --> 1:00:28.991
and I was in the middle
of my workday,

1:00:29.026 --> 1:00:30.392
so if you wouldn't mind.

1:00:30.461 --> 1:00:32.294
Right.

1:00:32.329 --> 1:00:34.129
Thank you for your time, Victor.

1:00:44.174 --> 1:00:45.574
"On the ropes." Do you know
that expression?

1:00:45.609 --> 1:00:46.475
We had him.

1:00:46.543 --> 1:00:48.010
Yeah, he's their family lawyer,

1:00:48.045 --> 1:00:49.978
and their friend who wasn't
going to say anything else.

1:00:50.014 --> 1:00:52.180
Besides, we know it had
to be Caitlyn.

1:00:52.216 --> 1:00:53.682
Well, I mean, she was
the only one left.

1:00:53.751 --> 1:00:54.483
Right.

1:00:54.551 --> 1:00:55.617
And the night that Gil died,

1:00:55.653 --> 1:00:57.285
she said "we should
call Uncle Victor,

1:00:57.354 --> 1:00:58.353
"he'll know what to do."

1:00:58.389 --> 1:00:59.888
That's her instinct.

1:00:59.957 --> 1:01:02.791
So, Eileen said that she hasn't
been spending time

1:01:02.826 --> 1:01:03.992
with Mary lately.

1:01:04.061 --> 1:01:06.862
I think she's planning something
with Andy Woods.

1:01:06.897 --> 1:01:09.064
You have a lot to figure out.

1:01:09.133 --> 1:01:10.866
Wha... What about you?

1:01:10.934 --> 1:01:12.367
I'm doing a lot of work.

1:01:12.403 --> 1:01:15.070
I actually just sent Kendall
a form for Benson Holdings,

1:01:15.105 --> 1:01:16.738
she's going to do some digging
around online

1:01:16.774 --> 1:01:20.275
and I'm gonna go to the address
and do some digging myself.

1:01:20.310 --> 1:01:21.510
Sounds like Kendall's
doing a lot of work.

1:01:21.545 --> 1:01:22.577
Kendall is doing a lot of work.

1:01:22.613 --> 1:01:23.578
[laughs]

1:01:57.915 --> 1:02:00.816
<i> None of the Saunier family,</i>
<i> except Gil,</i>

1:02:00.851 --> 1:02:03.819
had an alibi that could be
verified for Colton's death.

1:02:03.854 --> 1:02:06.655
Mary claimed that she saw
someone running from the scene

1:02:06.690 --> 1:02:09.291
and hiding in Kelleher's farm.

1:02:09.326 --> 1:02:13.595
There is no confirmation
of that.

1:02:13.630 --> 1:02:16.264
Gil Saunier was convinced

1:02:16.333 --> 1:02:18.934
that his sister-in-law Mary
had killed his father.

1:02:18.969 --> 1:02:21.470
But was that the logical
conclusion?

1:02:21.505 --> 1:02:25.407
Is there any evidence to suggest
that Mary Saunier is...

1:02:25.442 --> 1:02:29.111
only in it for the money?

1:02:29.146 --> 1:02:33.381
We will continue to explore
all these possibilities,

1:02:33.417 --> 1:02:37.119
but given this enmeshed family,

1:02:37.154 --> 1:02:38.820
it is hard to believe that
the answer will come

1:02:38.856 --> 1:02:40.489
from an outsider.

1:02:50.167 --> 1:02:51.166

1:03:24.868 --> 1:03:26.635
Gotcha.

1:03:31.642 --> 1:03:33.775
d Andy come out,

1:03:33.811 --> 1:03:34.910
and it doesn't even look like

1:03:34.945 --> 1:03:37.245
they're going to let Ryan
inside, like...

1:03:37.281 --> 1:03:38.413
like it's definitely
not friendly.

1:03:38.448 --> 1:03:40.615
Yeah, and they don't look happy.

1:03:40.651 --> 1:03:42.450
They knew each other,
that was clear.

1:03:42.486 --> 1:03:43.785
Definitely.

1:03:43.821 --> 1:03:45.253
So, they had this big
back and forth,

1:03:45.289 --> 1:03:47.556
and then finally they
all go inside.

1:03:47.591 --> 1:03:48.323
Hmm.

1:03:48.358 --> 1:03:49.958
Are they still there now?

1:03:49.993 --> 1:03:52.761
No, no, Ryan left
about 25 minutes after,

1:03:52.796 --> 1:03:55.463
and then 15 minutes after that,
Caitlyn went out the back way.

1:03:55.532 --> 1:03:56.198
This is great.

1:03:56.233 --> 1:03:57.666
Is it?

1:03:57.701 --> 1:03:59.201
'Cause I was kind of going
with ugly conspiracy to murder.

1:03:59.236 --> 1:03:59.868
No.

1:03:59.903 --> 1:04:00.669
[laughs]

1:04:00.704 --> 1:04:01.703
The photos are great, Chuck.

1:04:01.772 --> 1:04:02.370
Right.

1:04:02.406 --> 1:04:03.171
Good work.

1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:04.639
Did you want me to go back?

1:04:04.708 --> 1:04:05.974
Make sure Andy doesn't leave
before you can talk to him?

1:04:06.009 --> 1:04:07.509
Yeah, maybe tomorrow morning.

1:04:07.544 --> 1:04:09.578
But the bottom line is that Andy
has decided to stick around,

1:04:09.646 --> 1:04:10.712
for some reason.

1:04:10.781 --> 1:04:12.147
Explains why Caitlyn
hasn't been around.

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:13.281
Right.

1:04:13.317 --> 1:04:14.716
Owen just messaged me.

1:04:14.751 --> 1:04:16.117
He got images off the hard
drives from Colton's death.

1:04:16.186 --> 1:04:17.152
He's going to clean them up,

1:04:17.187 --> 1:04:18.253
he's gonna send them
in the morning.

1:04:18.322 --> 1:04:20.188
Well that will help a lot.

1:04:33.170 --> 1:04:34.302
Mary!

1:04:34.371 --> 1:04:36.071

Oh, hey, hey. It's okay.

1:04:37.641 --> 1:04:39.608
It's so wrong.

1:04:39.643 --> 1:04:40.775
At least we could post bail.

1:04:40.811 --> 1:04:42.143
He was charged with murder.

1:04:42.179 --> 1:04:43.245
They could've held him.

1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:43.912
He's right.

1:04:43.947 --> 1:04:45.614
At least I'm home.

1:04:45.682 --> 1:04:46.748
You rest.

1:04:46.817 --> 1:04:48.617

your defence.

1:04:51.088 --> 1:04:52.487
Applied for what?

1:04:52.556 --> 1:04:54.689
Well, they put in a bid to build
an assisted living complex

1:04:54.725 --> 1:04:55.690
with for the state,

1:04:55.726 --> 1:04:57.025
which I think means
that they had

1:04:57.060 --> 1:04:59.861
to divulge more information
about their structure.

1:04:59.930 --> 1:05:03.231
Did they fill out a 44-98-14-J?

1:05:03.267 --> 1:05:04.232
Maybe?

1:05:04.268 --> 1:05:05.533
'Cause that's what
I can find here.

1:05:05.569 --> 1:05:07.369
It has a list of the officers
and board members.

1:05:07.404 --> 1:05:09.704
Well, wait, can you get to it

1:05:09.773 --> 1:05:11.106
without breaking a major
hacking law?

1:05:11.141 --> 1:05:12.974
Because I cannot afford bail.

1:05:13.043 --> 1:05:14.342
[laughs]

1:05:14.378 --> 1:05:16.678
It's info you can totally get
in another two weeks

1:05:16.713 --> 1:05:18.513
with a freedom of
information request.

1:05:18.548 --> 1:05:21.283
<i> Or, you can open your email.</i>

1:05:21.318 --> 1:05:23.184
Great. Let's go with Plan B.

1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:24.452
[laughs]

1:05:24.521 --> 1:05:25.487
Done.

1:05:26.423 --> 1:05:27.856
So, how's school?

1:05:27.891 --> 1:05:28.924
Uh, good.

1:05:28.959 --> 1:05:30.625
I got an A on the chemistry
midterm.

1:05:30.661 --> 1:05:32.294
Of course you did.

1:05:32.362 --> 1:05:33.528
<i> Any fun?</i>

1:05:33.563 --> 1:05:34.596
What?

1:05:34.665 --> 1:05:36.398
Well, this is the carefree

1:05:36.466 --> 1:05:39.000
kinda reckless time
of your life, so...

1:05:39.036 --> 1:05:40.669
Hey, wait, what about
Mathletes on water?

1:05:40.737 --> 1:05:44.673
Oh, it's raining too hard here.
They'll reschedule.

1:05:44.708 --> 1:05:45.240
[email notification]

1:05:45.309 --> 1:05:46.141
Oh, okay.

1:05:46.176 --> 1:05:47.442
I think I got it here.

1:05:47.477 --> 1:05:50.612
Thank you, I will be home soon,
all right?

1:05:50.647 --> 1:05:52.714
Okay. Expose some bad guys,
will you?

1:05:52.749 --> 1:05:53.748
I will.

1:05:56.887 --> 1:05:59.020
He is going to need a printer.

1:05:59.089 --> 1:06:01.323
I'm gonna need a printer.

1:06:01.391 --> 1:06:03.191
I need a printer!

1:06:04.428 --> 1:06:05.260
I found a printer.

1:06:05.295 --> 1:06:05.961
[laughs]

1:06:05.996 --> 1:06:07.595
How thrilling for you.

1:06:07.631 --> 1:06:08.663
Don't mock.

1:06:08.699 --> 1:06:10.265
You're gonna want a copy
of this, too.

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:11.399
Okay.

1:06:11.435 --> 1:06:12.600
I bet I can't wait...

1:06:12.636 --> 1:06:14.002
Oh. It's Eileen.

1:06:14.037 --> 1:06:16.338
Jackson was charged
with Gil's murder.

1:06:16.373 --> 1:06:17.706
He's out on bail.

1:06:17.774 --> 1:06:19.407
Ah... We should speak
to him soon.

1:06:19.443 --> 1:06:20.241
Yeah.

1:06:20.277 --> 1:06:21.443
Okay, sorry, so what?

1:06:21.478 --> 1:06:22.744
Oh, corporate structure
for Benson Holdings.

1:06:22.779 --> 1:06:23.979
Oh, right.

1:06:24.014 --> 1:06:25.246
But don't we already know that
Ryan Abbey's dad

1:06:25.315 --> 1:06:26.047
is the president?

1:06:26.116 --> 1:06:27.849
Just keep reading.

1:06:27.918 --> 1:06:31.219
V. L. Macklin is
the founder and chair.

1:06:31.254 --> 1:06:33.521
Virginia Louise Macklin.

1:06:33.557 --> 1:06:34.522
The card cheat?

1:06:34.558 --> 1:06:36.191
The sweet old lady
who was so sad

1:06:36.226 --> 1:06:38.626
and resigned in
the face of change.

1:06:38.662 --> 1:06:40.462
Is buying up the entire town.

1:06:40.530 --> 1:06:41.930
[bells ring]

1:06:41.965 --> 1:06:43.531
<i> Maybe.</i>

1:06:43.567 --> 1:06:46.101
<i> Sounds to me like she might be</i>
<i> very passionate about her town.</i>

1:06:46.136 --> 1:06:49.137
<i> Oh, come on.  This whole thing</i>
<i> is about money.</i>

1:06:49.172 --> 1:06:50.138
Well, you should give her
a call.

1:06:50.207 --> 1:06:51.606
Oh, I never would've thought
of that.

1:06:51.675 --> 1:06:53.341
Thank you, I'm going.
Oh, great, thanks.

1:06:53.377 --> 1:06:54.676
Always happy to help.

1:06:54.711 --> 1:06:56.678
I'll meet you back
at the basement.

1:07:09.793 --> 1:07:12.227
So, if Virginia Macklin
is behind it,

1:07:12.262 --> 1:07:14.996
what does that mean?

1:07:15.032 --> 1:07:18.299
Farmer Donna trashed
the Chaberton Acreage,

1:07:18.335 --> 1:07:22.404
got new equipment,
lots of cash.

1:07:22.439 --> 1:07:24.205
Maybe Virginia's driving down
the price of the Saunier land.

1:07:24.241 --> 1:07:29.577
Okay. So you're saying that
you think Virginia Macklin

1:07:29.613 --> 1:07:32.847
is in cahoots with
Donna Kelleher.

1:07:32.883 --> 1:07:36.351
Well, it is the second name
she mentioned after all.

1:07:36.420 --> 1:07:39.054
Kelleher family also founded
the town.

1:07:39.089 --> 1:07:40.722
They seem like a very
odd couple.

1:07:40.757 --> 1:07:42.023
Yes, they are.

1:07:42.059 --> 1:07:43.458
Also, she said that she wasn't
really that happy

1:07:43.493 --> 1:07:44.926
with the Sauniers.

1:07:44.961 --> 1:07:46.127
She thinks that the whole
downfall of the town happened

1:07:46.163 --> 1:07:47.996
when they rolled in and planted
that vineyard.

1:07:48.065 --> 1:07:49.097
Right.

1:07:49.132 --> 1:07:50.899
Do you think that
she could've...

1:07:50.934 --> 1:07:53.802
I mean, that she would've,
I don't know,

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:55.637
hired someone to kill them?

1:07:55.672 --> 1:07:56.604
[sighs]

1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:57.806
I can't see that.

1:07:57.874 --> 1:07:59.107
But then again, I didn't suspect
her of anything

1:07:59.176 --> 1:08:00.575
in the first place.

1:08:00.610 --> 1:08:01.209
Right.

1:08:01.244 --> 1:08:02.177
[phone notification]

1:08:02.212 --> 1:08:04.045
What about Donna?
Maybe she...

1:08:04.114 --> 1:08:07.549
Oh, I am going to need
to download some files.

1:08:07.584 --> 1:08:08.917
<i> Well, what is it?</i>

1:08:08.952 --> 1:08:11.052
Okay, Owen just sent me...

1:08:11.088 --> 1:08:13.755
Footage from the security
cameras.

1:08:25.235 --> 1:08:27.102
Ah, there we go.

1:08:27.437 --> 1:08:28.903
Wow, 'kay.

1:08:28.939 --> 1:08:30.405
So that's where
the control panel is,

1:08:30.474 --> 1:08:31.406
back there, right?

1:08:31.475 --> 1:08:32.941
Yeah. Can you see
what he pushes?

1:08:32.976 --> 1:08:35.510
No, but he's clearly, you know,
opening the vents.

1:08:35.579 --> 1:08:36.644
It's Colton, right?

1:08:36.713 --> 1:08:38.746
He's the only one
who went into the vat.

1:08:38.782 --> 1:08:39.981
There he goes.

1:08:40.016 --> 1:08:41.616
There's a ladder, why
is it right in the way?

1:08:41.651 --> 1:08:42.550
That's a little concerning.

1:08:42.619 --> 1:08:43.585
Hello.

1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:44.185
Wait, freeze it.

1:08:44.254 --> 1:08:45.787
Ooh, yeah. No.

1:08:45.822 --> 1:08:46.588
Just go back.

1:08:46.623 --> 1:08:47.522
Do, do, do, do, do.

1:08:47.557 --> 1:08:48.823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah! Stop.

1:08:48.859 --> 1:08:50.125
Good, there.

1:08:50.226 --> 1:08:52.594
So, maybe that's... is that
a hat he's wearing?

1:08:52.629 --> 1:08:54.129
I don't know, can you...

1:08:54.164 --> 1:08:56.464
Yeah, I think that's a hat
with like a brim.

1:08:56.533 --> 1:08:58.433
If you could just see past
the ladder, there's...

1:08:58.502 --> 1:08:59.167
[phone rings]

1:08:59.202 --> 1:09:00.468
Oh.

1:09:00.504 --> 1:09:04.339
[phone rings]

1:09:04.407 --> 1:09:05.707
Hey, Chuck.

1:09:05.742 --> 1:09:07.175
[whispers] Hey, Alex.
There's movement over here.

1:09:07.210 --> 1:09:09.878
Andy and Caitlyn, they're
loading things into his truck.

1:09:09.913 --> 1:09:10.879
What?

1:09:10.947 --> 1:09:11.513
I think they're going
on the run.

1:09:11.548 --> 1:09:12.680
Stop them.

1:09:12.749 --> 1:09:14.782
And I'll call Eileen
and we'll be on our way.

1:09:14.818 --> 1:09:15.817
Okay.

1:09:19.489 --> 1:09:20.688
Stop them?

1:09:21.958 --> 1:09:23.758
He says he sees them
trying to leave.

1:09:23.793 --> 1:09:25.393
We gotta go.

1:09:28.732 --> 1:09:30.565
What's the problem?

1:09:30.634 --> 1:09:32.200
Oh no, I wish I knew.

1:09:32.269 --> 1:09:34.102
Just conked out on me, dead.

1:09:34.137 --> 1:09:35.069
I'll call for a tow truck,
sorry,

1:09:35.105 --> 1:09:37.105
it shouldn't take too long.

1:09:37.174 --> 1:09:38.973
Well, we're kind of
in a hurry.

1:09:39.009 --> 1:09:41.042
I'll give you a jump.

1:09:41.111 --> 1:09:43.077
Great, great.

1:09:54.758 --> 1:09:56.024
Eileen, please.

1:09:56.059 --> 1:09:56.991
Let us go.

1:09:57.027 --> 1:09:58.426
We're both adults.

1:09:58.495 --> 1:10:00.461
We want to be together.

1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:12.106
Do your parents know?

1:10:12.142 --> 1:10:13.975
Dad went ballistic.

1:10:14.010 --> 1:10:16.444
He didn't think Andy
was good enough.

1:10:16.479 --> 1:10:18.213
Dad will never accept Andy.

1:10:18.248 --> 1:10:19.247
Mary would.

1:10:19.316 --> 1:10:20.548
She tried to run interference
for us,

1:10:20.617 --> 1:10:22.150
but Dad's too stubborn.

1:10:22.185 --> 1:10:23.451
Must have been tough,

1:10:23.486 --> 1:10:25.553
stuck between your boyfriend
and your family.

1:10:25.589 --> 1:10:27.288
It's impossible.

1:10:27.357 --> 1:10:28.489
I have to go.

1:10:28.525 --> 1:10:29.190
Where?

1:10:29.226 --> 1:10:30.225
Where will you go?

1:10:30.293 --> 1:10:31.693
Napa Valley.

1:10:31.761 --> 1:10:37.765
Andy's a craftsman, he...
we... should do what we love.

1:10:37.834 --> 1:10:40.868
Love who we love.

1:10:40.937 --> 1:10:42.470
It was getting desperate, man.

1:10:42.505 --> 1:10:45.273
I even agreed to spy on Kelleher
for Ryan Abbey,

1:10:45.308 --> 1:10:46.908
just for a buck.

1:10:46.943 --> 1:10:48.710
No one will hire me
in this town.

1:10:48.745 --> 1:10:50.545
Even the wineries
who know how good I am.

1:10:50.614 --> 1:10:54.315
But what will you kids live on,
besides love?

1:10:54.384 --> 1:10:57.018
Ryan finally paid Andy what
he owed him for the house,

1:10:57.053 --> 1:10:58.686
and some work Andy did.

1:10:58.722 --> 1:11:01.956
Andy sold his house
to Ryan Abbey.

1:11:01.992 --> 1:11:03.258
Don't they know about the theft?

1:11:03.293 --> 1:11:04.692
That wasn't my handwriting.

1:11:04.728 --> 1:11:06.294
Look.

1:11:06.329 --> 1:11:09.397
Here's the contract for the sale
of my house.

1:11:09.466 --> 1:11:12.834
I don't mean to sound
unsympathetic, but I mean...

1:11:12.902 --> 1:11:14.869
have you thought about
what this will do to your dad?

1:11:14.904 --> 1:11:15.770
And your stepmom?

1:11:15.839 --> 1:11:18.239
I'm not dying or anything.

1:11:18.308 --> 1:11:23.144
Anyway, I... took care of Mary.

1:11:23.213 --> 1:11:25.280
Both of them.

1:11:25.348 --> 1:11:27.081
You have it, don't you?

1:11:27.150 --> 1:11:30.251
You have the will that Mary took
from Gil's office.

1:11:33.823 --> 1:11:37.191
I finally got copies of those
so-called "cheques."

1:11:37.227 --> 1:11:39.494
Look at the handwriting.

1:11:41.464 --> 1:11:42.664
It's close.

1:11:42.732 --> 1:11:43.731
Yeah, yeah, but I'm telling you,
that wasn't me.

1:11:43.767 --> 1:11:44.732
Someone wanted me out
of Chaberton,

1:11:44.768 --> 1:11:46.200
and they made it happen.

1:11:46.236 --> 1:11:47.635
Do you mind if we keep these
samples of your handwriting

1:11:47.671 --> 1:11:48.703
and get them checked out?

1:11:48.772 --> 1:11:51.005
Yeah, yeah.

1:11:54.911 --> 1:11:57.011
So that's how you were going
to take care of them,

1:11:57.047 --> 1:11:59.580
even though Mary shouldn't have
taken it in the first place.

1:11:59.616 --> 1:12:01.582
That move made her look
so guilty.

1:12:01.618 --> 1:12:03.451
If your parents are innocent,

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:08.189
that will can't hurt them, but
it can give us some answers.

1:12:16.633 --> 1:12:17.398
Hey.

1:12:17.467 --> 1:12:18.866
Oh.

1:12:18.935 --> 1:12:20.902
So, what's the story with
the handwriting analysis test?

1:12:20.937 --> 1:12:22.303
Well, they said it was close,

1:12:22.372 --> 1:12:24.205
but the handwriting on the
cheques was not Andy Wood's.

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:27.041
So he was set up. Why?

1:12:27.077 --> 1:12:30.878
Uh, I guess whoever killed
Colton wanted a patsy.

1:12:30.914 --> 1:12:32.580
Because if it turned out
they didn't believe

1:12:32.615 --> 1:12:34.082
the accidental death story,

1:12:34.117 --> 1:12:37.018
there he is, the
perfect suspect.

1:12:37.053 --> 1:12:38.953
Mmhmm. Look at this.

1:12:38.988 --> 1:12:40.588
You got the will,
did you find anything?

1:12:40.623 --> 1:12:43.424
If there is a clue there,
I haven't found it yet.

1:12:43.460 --> 1:12:48.496
Well, if there's anyone
who could find it, it's you.

1:12:48.531 --> 1:12:49.764
All right, well, you got
a lot of work to do,

1:12:49.799 --> 1:12:50.932
so I'll let you get back to it.

1:12:50.967 --> 1:12:53.601
Uh, yeah. Okay.

1:12:53.670 --> 1:12:55.503
Thanks.

1:13:00.310 --> 1:13:01.309
[recorder beeps]

1:13:04.414 --> 1:13:07.014
Really, no matter
which will was in effect,

1:13:07.050 --> 1:13:11.519
nothing Colton signed
can be closed.

1:13:11.554 --> 1:13:14.088
Everyone is stuck in limbo
because Colton's stock,

1:13:14.157 --> 1:13:18.326
his actual shares
in the vineyard, are missing.

1:13:18.361 --> 1:13:20.561
So who has them?

1:13:20.597 --> 1:13:22.563
And what are they planning?

1:13:24.534 --> 1:13:25.933
[tapping sound]

1:13:39.816 --> 1:13:41.315
[footsteps o

1:13:41.384 --> 1:13:43.217
Oh. Hey guys, sorry I'm late.

1:13:43.253 --> 1:13:43.851
No Eileen, huh?

1:13:43.887 --> 1:13:44.819
Hey.

1:13:44.854 --> 1:13:46.254
I was up all night
looking at this.

1:13:46.322 --> 1:13:47.288
I can't even see straight.

1:13:47.323 --> 1:13:48.623
[laughs]

1:13:48.658 --> 1:13:50.091
No matter how many times
I read it,

1:13:50.126 --> 1:13:51.659
it still does not provide me
with the information I need,

1:13:51.728 --> 1:13:54.395
which is where are Colton's
shares of the vineyard.

1:13:54.431 --> 1:13:55.663
Well, can we help you
with something, or?

1:13:55.698 --> 1:13:58.633
No. Eat.

1:13:58.668 --> 1:14:01.369
Maybe Hilliard can tell you.

1:14:01.404 --> 1:14:02.403
Hilliard.

1:14:02.439 --> 1:14:04.172
[mumbles] Right here,
right here.

1:14:05.742 --> 1:14:08.176
Wow. You got real hawk-eyes
there, dontcha?

1:14:08.211 --> 1:14:09.944
It's just 20-20.
Just standard 20-20.

1:14:09.979 --> 1:14:13.781
Hilliard Financials is
a subsidiary of...

1:14:13.850 --> 1:14:17.652
Benson Holdings?

1:14:17.687 --> 1:14:19.921
Mrs. Macklin strikes again.

1:14:22.859 --> 1:14:24.492
Your assistant is lovely.

1:14:24.527 --> 1:14:26.394
Yes, she really is
a great assistant.

1:14:26.463 --> 1:14:28.296
Aww, thank you so much.

1:14:28.331 --> 1:14:29.263
Hmm.

1:14:29.299 --> 1:14:30.465
Now, Mrs. Macklin,
would you mind

1:14:30.533 --> 1:14:32.867
if I recorded your conversation?

1:14:32.902 --> 1:14:34.502
It would just really
help me with...

1:14:34.537 --> 1:14:35.636
Oh no, of course.

1:14:35.672 --> 1:14:36.838
Thank you.

1:14:36.873 --> 1:14:37.939
[recorder beeps]

1:14:37.974 --> 1:14:38.973
Great. Thank you
so much.

1:14:39.008 --> 1:14:40.575
Oh, no, no. Leave that.

1:14:40.610 --> 1:14:42.276
My cook is in the kitchen,

1:14:42.345 --> 1:14:44.512
and I'm sure she can find
you a lovely snack.

1:14:44.547 --> 1:14:47.081
Oh, that's so... um...

1:14:47.116 --> 1:14:48.316
[clears throat]

1:14:48.351 --> 1:14:50.318
I'll make myself scarce.

1:14:52.388 --> 1:14:53.554
Hmm.

1:14:54.491 --> 1:14:55.356
[whispers] She's new.

1:14:55.391 --> 1:14:57.158
[laughs]

1:14:57.193 --> 1:14:59.393
Uh, first of all, I just want
to say thank you again

1:14:59.429 --> 1:15:01.095
for taking time,rs. Macklin.

1:15:01.130 --> 1:15:03.998
I just wanted to go over
some details for my story.

1:15:04.033 --> 1:15:06.300
You mentioned previously
that you thought Macklin

1:15:06.336 --> 1:15:11.405
went off the rails in the '60s
when your father sold land

1:15:11.441 --> 1:15:12.840
to Colton Saunier.

1:15:12.876 --> 1:15:15.109
Well, it certainly started
the ball rolling downhill

1:15:15.144 --> 1:15:16.210
for all of us.

1:15:16.279 --> 1:15:16.978
I mean, I... I think.

1:15:17.013 --> 1:15:21.516
But... You can't go back.

1:15:21.551 --> 1:15:23.518
Must be tempting though,
to want to go back

1:15:23.553 --> 1:15:27.388
and write the wrongs of
the past, the injustice.

1:15:27.423 --> 1:15:29.223
[sighs]

1:15:29.259 --> 1:15:32.693
You are a very dramatic
young man.

1:15:32.729 --> 1:15:36.564
Yes, I... I really do try
to live in the present.

1:15:36.599 --> 1:15:39.400
How do you find the present
is treating you personally?

1:15:39.435 --> 1:15:42.069
Oh, I... I'm comfortable enough.

1:15:42.138 --> 1:15:46.440
I have a niece and nephews
and grandchildren,

1:15:46.476 --> 1:15:49.510
and they do... sing happy
birthday to me.

1:15:49.546 --> 1:15:51.646
Uh, your family lives
in Macklin?

1:15:51.681 --> 1:15:54.148
Your nephews?

1:15:54.183 --> 1:15:55.349
Please, join us.

1:15:55.418 --> 1:15:56.717
Thank you.

1:15:56.753 --> 1:15:58.619
Um, I have, uh, three nephews.

1:15:58.688 --> 1:16:01.255
Oh. That's nice.
Do they visit?

1:16:01.324 --> 1:16:02.857
Well, two live in Philadelphia,

1:16:02.892 --> 1:16:06.294
and one is local but I don't see
him nearly enough.

1:16:06.329 --> 1:16:07.428
Well, that's a shame.

1:16:07.463 --> 1:16:08.729
Oh, no, he's travelling
all the time,

1:16:08.765 --> 1:16:10.431
and he works very hard.

1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:13.801
But you know, sometimes I
think he overcompensates.

1:16:13.836 --> 1:16:17.738
Like singlehandedly trying
to build a family fortune,

1:16:17.774 --> 1:16:19.941
and I say "what's the point
of that?"

1:16:20.009 --> 1:16:22.610
Now, a great niece or nephew,

1:16:22.645 --> 1:16:24.745
that's a thing that would make
me the happiest.

1:16:24.781 --> 1:16:25.646
What does he do?

1:16:25.682 --> 1:16:26.714
Lawyer.

1:16:26.749 --> 1:16:28.115
Something to do
with investment, uh...

1:16:28.184 --> 1:16:30.318
Private banking.

1:16:30.353 --> 1:16:31.786
I don't really follow it.

1:16:31.821 --> 1:16:33.354
Mrs. Macklin, I'm so sorry.

1:16:33.389 --> 1:16:38.225
I just remembered that I booked
my boss on another appointment.

1:16:38.261 --> 1:16:39.594
Oh. Oh, of course.

1:16:39.662 --> 1:16:41.495
And it conflicts. I just
didn't realize.

1:16:41.531 --> 1:16:42.363
Oh no, no, of course.

1:16:42.398 --> 1:16:43.831
I mean, don't let me keep you.

1:16:43.866 --> 1:16:45.733
Thank you so much for your
time. We really appreciate it.

1:16:45.768 --> 1:16:46.734
You're very welcome.
Thank you.

1:16:46.769 --> 1:16:47.468
Thank you for your hospitality.

1:16:47.537 --> 1:16:48.936
Of course. Thank you.

1:16:49.005 --> 1:16:49.971
Bye bye.

1:17:04.354 --> 1:17:08.356
Remember that photo we have on
the board of Jackson and Gil

1:17:08.391 --> 1:17:10.958
and Colton... and...

1:17:10.994 --> 1:17:11.726
Victor.

1:17:11.794 --> 1:17:13.160
Lustig.

1:17:13.196 --> 1:17:14.962
V. L. Macklin.

1:17:14.998 --> 1:17:16.964
He's been hiding in plain sight.

1:17:24.107 --> 1:17:25.473
So what do you say?

1:17:25.541 --> 1:17:27.742
Do you think we have enough
to go to the sheriff yet?

1:17:27.777 --> 1:17:30.544
We should go back to the winery
and check the security footage.

1:17:30.613 --> 1:17:31.979
Maybe there's something
on the restored hard drives

1:17:32.015 --> 1:17:33.948
that can link Victor
to Colton's death.

1:17:43.993 --> 1:17:46.827
[phone buzzes]

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:53.801
<i> Hi Auntie V. Is there</i>
<i> a problem?</i>

1:17:54.871 --> 1:17:56.203
So where's the family?

1:17:56.239 --> 1:17:58.039
Eileen said they
have a court hearing,

1:17:58.074 --> 1:18:00.041
so we're clear for a while.

1:18:03.546 --> 1:18:08.215
So... The camera can totally
see me from here.

1:18:08.251 --> 1:18:11.585
Oh, but remember there was
a ladder in the way.

1:18:11.621 --> 1:18:13.988
And now you're in the way.

1:18:15.091 --> 1:18:16.390
What are you doing here?

1:18:16.426 --> 1:18:19.193
Taking care of the Sauniers,
of course.

1:18:19.228 --> 1:18:22.229
And I'll take those cell phones.

1:18:25.435 --> 1:18:28.035
You shouldn't be here.
At all.

1:18:28.071 --> 1:18:29.036
You were warned.

1:18:29.072 --> 1:18:29.870
You don't want to do this,
Victor.

1:18:29.939 --> 1:18:31.105
There are cameras in here.

1:18:31.140 --> 1:18:33.074
Heh. Those old cameras?

1:18:33.109 --> 1:18:35.443
<i> You have no idea how easy</i>
<i> they are to scramble.</i>

1:18:35.511 --> 1:18:36.677
How are you going
to stage this one?

1:18:36.713 --> 1:18:38.345
You should've left
my aunt alone.

1:18:38.381 --> 1:18:40.014
She knows nothing.

1:18:40.083 --> 1:18:41.148
How's she gonna feel
when she finds out

1:18:41.184 --> 1:18:42.483
that you killed two people?

1:18:42.552 --> 1:18:44.385
Well, they were her enemies
before they were mine.

1:18:44.420 --> 1:18:45.686
So you murdered them?

1:18:45.722 --> 1:18:47.154
Is that Mary's gun?

1:18:47.190 --> 1:18:48.789
Mmhmm.

1:18:48.825 --> 1:18:49.990
And I'm just going to toss it
in the brush

1:18:50.026 --> 1:18:51.926
for the deputies to find.

1:18:54.197 --> 1:18:57.164
Eileen? Chuck?
Are you there?

1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:58.365
You get all that?

1:18:58.401 --> 1:19:00.634
<i> (Eileen) Every word.</i>

1:19:00.670 --> 1:19:03.270
Uh, the... the sheriff
is outside already.

1:19:03.306 --> 1:19:05.873
<i> [police sirens wailing]</i>

1:19:07.210 --> 1:19:10.444
Don't even think about it,
Victor!

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:11.612
I'm taking your weapon.

1:19:11.647 --> 1:19:15.750
I'm placing you under arrest
for murder.

1:19:15.818 --> 1:19:17.518
The sheriff is here to see
the hard drives

1:19:17.553 --> 1:19:18.953
from Colton's murder.

1:19:18.988 --> 1:19:20.354
We weren't expecting you.

1:19:20.389 --> 1:19:22.223
So thanks for popping by.

1:19:23.926 --> 1:19:26.160
That felt good.

1:19:32.368 --> 1:19:34.735
[laughing]

1:19:40.543 --> 1:19:41.275
Thank you.

1:19:41.310 --> 1:19:42.676
I'm glad I could help.

1:19:42.712 --> 1:19:44.845
We could help.

1:19:44.881 --> 1:19:45.913
Come back next year
for the harvest.

1:19:45.982 --> 1:19:46.981
Oh, you know I will.

1:19:47.016 --> 1:19:47.782
I know you will.

1:19:47.817 --> 1:19:50.451
[laughs]

1:19:50.486 --> 1:19:51.452
Eileen.

1:19:51.487 --> 1:19:54.188
Oh, Jackson.

1:19:54.223 --> 1:19:55.823
Good luck, Mary.

1:19:56.492 --> 1:19:57.858
Come on, Eileen,
back to work.

1:19:57.927 --> 1:19:59.426
Ah, yeah.

1:19:59.462 --> 1:20:00.261
Bye!

1:20:00.296 --> 1:20:01.262
Bye!

1:20:12.542 --> 1:20:14.375
Victor Lustig Macklin
was arrested

1:20:14.410 --> 1:20:16.710
on two counts of murder.

1:20:16.779 --> 1:20:20.881
For the deaths of Colton
and Gil Saunier.

1:20:20.917 --> 1:20:24.718
<i> Donna Kelleher, who hid Victor</i>
<i> after he fled the scene of</i>

1:20:24.787 --> 1:20:28.289
<i> Colton's murder, was arrested</i>
<i> for aiding and abetting.</i>

1:20:28.324 --> 1:20:32.226
Victor's payoff helped take care
of the Kelleher farm

1:20:32.261 --> 1:20:33.661
for the last year,

1:20:33.696 --> 1:20:38.098
and she obliged him by polluting
her neighbour's land.

1:20:38.134 --> 1:20:40.734
Victor was hoping
that it would drive down

1:20:40.770 --> 1:20:44.138
the value of Chaberton, and
he could buy it for a song.

1:20:44.173 --> 1:20:48.475
Instead, it's the Kelleher farm
that will likely be sold,

1:20:48.511 --> 1:20:51.846
<i> but not to Victor and</i>
<i> his partner Daniel Abbey,</i>

1:20:51.881 --> 1:20:54.114
<i> but to Daniel's son Ryan.</i>

1:20:54.150 --> 1:20:58.752
<i> Maybe he'll use it to grow</i>
<i> the forest of his dreams.</i>

1:20:58.788 --> 1:21:01.822
Victor had manipulated Colton
for years.

1:21:01.858 --> 1:21:04.191
He tricked him out of his shares
of the vineyard

1:21:04.227 --> 1:21:05.860
with a private banking scheme,

1:21:05.928 --> 1:21:08.629
then all he had to do
was get rid of Gil.

1:21:08.664 --> 1:21:10.731
With the value of
the property degraded,

1:21:10.766 --> 1:21:13.000
and no one to run the vineyard,

1:21:13.035 --> 1:21:16.637
Victor was convinced
that Jackson would sell.

1:21:16.672 --> 1:21:22.209
He could right his family's
first worst mistake.

1:21:22.245 --> 1:21:25.946
<i> But instead, Jackson is going</i>
<i> to keep Chaberton open,</i>

1:21:25.982 --> 1:21:27.815
<i> and he's going to run it</i>
<i> with the help of his wife,</i>

1:21:27.884 --> 1:21:30.651
<i> his daughter, and a talented</i>
<i> winemaker</i>

1:21:30.686 --> 1:21:33.687
<i> who will start new traditions.</i>

1:21:38.027 --> 1:21:42.029
<i> And now, on land that</i>
<i> was once thought useless,</i>

1:21:42.064 --> 1:21:44.865
<i> grow the perfect vines.</i>

1:21:44.934 --> 1:21:47.701
I'm Alex McPherson,
and this is "Recovered".

1:22:03.853 --> 1:22:05.486
We talked about this before,

1:22:05.521 --> 1:22:08.022
but if we could just bring
down these expenditure
categories,

1:22:08.057 --> 1:22:09.657
I think it would make
a really big difference.

1:22:09.692 --> 1:22:11.859
Yeah, well, we're going to have
to upgrade some people.

1:22:11.894 --> 1:22:12.893
Maybe do some promotions.

1:22:12.929 --> 1:22:14.194
Right, but if we did it online,

1:22:14.263 --> 1:22:15.596
you know, I mean- everyone
could contribute and...

1:22:15.631 --> 1:22:17.264
Okay, look at this.

1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:18.399
Oh! Here we go.

1:22:18.434 --> 1:22:19.366
One for me?

1:22:19.402 --> 1:22:20.234
Oh yeah, of course, boss

1:22:20.303 --> 1:22:21.035
Wow.

1:22:21.070 --> 1:22:22.870
Thanks Chuck.

1:22:22.939 --> 1:22:23.837
Hot off the presses.

1:22:23.873 --> 1:22:26.540
Well done.
Good job, everybody.

1:22:26.575 --> 1:22:27.374
Alex, whenever you're ready.

1:22:27.410 --> 1:22:29.076
Yeah, great.

1:22:29.111 --> 1:22:30.377
It was a good field trip.

1:22:30.413 --> 1:22:33.447
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1:22:33.482 --> 1:22:36.250
I mean, except for
the ammonia poisoning,

1:22:36.285 --> 1:22:37.751
the toxic waste,
and the guns.

1:22:37.787 --> 1:22:38.986
Hmm.

1:22:39.021 --> 1:22:41.221
But you were right.

1:22:41.290 --> 1:22:42.756
Victor was in it
for the money.

1:22:42.792 --> 1:22:43.991
Oh, I don't know.

1:22:44.026 --> 1:22:45.426
I think Victor had already
made his money.

1:22:45.461 --> 1:22:48.329
I think it was family.
It was personal.

1:22:48.364 --> 1:22:51.865
So what happens if we each say
that the other person was right?

1:22:51.934 --> 1:22:55.903
I think the earth opens up
and swallows us whole.

1:22:55.938 --> 1:22:58.072
But I think we'll both survive.

1:23:00.142 --> 1:23:02.743
[phones ring]

1:23:02.778 --> 1:23:05.879
Hey Hearst you ready?
Come on, want to go?

1:23:06.849 --> 1:23:08.082
You, thank you so much.

1:23:08.150 --> 1:23:10.517
I could not have done that
without you.

1:23:15.424 --> 1:23:16.123
Come on.

1:23:16.192 --> 1:23:17.157
Okay.
