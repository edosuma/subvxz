WEBVTT

03:02.000 --> 03:03.923
You have command of Castle Black.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.407
It is my duty to tell you

03:06.480 --> 03:09.962
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

03:10.040 --> 03:13.965
and an insult to all the brothers
who have died fighting the wildlings.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.042
Thank you for your honesty.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.204
Safe travels.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.441
Thank you, Sam.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.166
Oh, um...

03:36.040 --> 03:37.451
It's dragonglass.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.290
It's what I used to kill the White Walker.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.965
I hope you don't need them.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.241
Me, too.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.645
There he is.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.885
That laugh.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.161
Egg.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.764
Egg laughed like that.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.605
One of the first things I remember.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.601
His little brother, Aegon. He became king.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.444
And before that, he was a jolly fellow,

04:51.880 --> 04:53.211
like this one.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.404
Get him south, Gillyflower.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.961
Before it's too late.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.406
Theon, wait.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.721
Not Theon. Reek.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.605
Help me.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.450
You're his wife now.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.681
Theon.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.121
Do what he says,

06:10.280 --> 06:11.805
or he'll hurt you.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.888
He already hurts me every night.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.611
All day I'm locked in this room,
and every night he comes...

06:20.880 --> 06:22.086
It can't be any worse.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.161
It can.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.005
It can always be worse.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.890
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.731
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry!

06:39.800 --> 06:42.041
You have to help me.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.282
He'll see us. You don't know him.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.090
My family still has friends in the North.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.811
All I need to do is give a signal,
and they'll rescue me.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.283
Climb to the top of the broken tower.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.843
Light this candle, and put it in the window.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.810
- Promise me, Theon.
- My name is Reek.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.086
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

07:04.560 --> 07:08.360
Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.930
Do you hear me?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.206
Theon.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.407
Promise me.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.280
Yes, Reek?

08:38.559 --> 08:39.890
Egg.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.486
Egg.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.442
Mother's looking for you.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.326
Egg.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.365
Get some sleep, Sam.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.729
You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.251
You don't know that.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.651
Get some sleep.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.450
I'll watch over him.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.051
I'm staying, too.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.129
He's always been good to me.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.885
I can't leave him now.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.651
Egg!

09:29.640 --> 09:30.721
Egg,

09:33.080 --> 09:34.445
I dreamed

09:36.000 --> 09:37.286
that I was old.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.167
His name was Aemon Targaryen.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.164
He came to us from King's Landing.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.690
A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.851
and sworn brother of the Night's Watch,
ever faithful.

10:04.720 --> 10:10.170
No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.011
At the Wall,

10:13.440 --> 10:17.081
a dozen lord commanders
came and went during his years of service,

10:17.160 --> 10:19.128
but he was always there to counsel them.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.284
He was the blood of the dragon,

10:26.360 --> 10:28.203
but now his fire has gone out.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.970
And now his watch is ended.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.488
And now his watch is ended.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.686
You're losing all your friends, Tarly.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.930
My beautiful wife.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.767
When my father told me we were marrying,
I half expected a fat, bearded beast.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.411
Do you know how pleased I was
when I saw you?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.962
You've made me very happy.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.968
Our scouts report
that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.764
He's a respected commander.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.322
His troops are loyal and battle-tested.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.882
He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords
to bolster his army.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.803
But this storm is a stroke of luck
for us northerners.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.720
Our people are used to
fighting in the frost.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.525
His army is out there now,
suffering in the snow.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.849
One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.287
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.522
But isn't your stepmother pregnant?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.161
What of it?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.408
What happens if she has a boy?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.723
Then I'll have a baby brother.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.251
But he'll be the heir.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.288
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.121
But you're a bastard.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.521
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.480
I've been naturalized by
a royal decree from...

13:13.560 --> 13:14.846
Tommen Baratheon?

13:15.440 --> 13:16.726
Another bastard.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.246
Bastards can rise high in the world.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.844
Like your half-brother, Jon Snow.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.723
Born the Bastard of Winterfell,

13:33.880 --> 13:36.406
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.365
You didn't know?

13:41.040 --> 13:43.441
Yes, he's done very well for himself.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.401
Ch.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.168
I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.006
Come, my lady.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.130
Your northern friend.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.608
Reek told me you wanted to leave.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.931
Why?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.731
Winterfell is your home,
and I am your husband.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.486
Tough old bird.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.441
Everyone talks when I start peeling them.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.961
But this one,

14:21.920 --> 14:24.400
her heart gave out
before I even got to her face.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.681
We do breed them tough in the North.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.122
Bring my wife back to her chamber.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.968
It's far too cold out here for a lady.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.042
You should hold on to your candles.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.167
The nights are so long now.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.247
Forty horses died in the night.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.283
We'll lose more come sunset.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.806
We're running out of food.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.526
We can't open the supply line
until the snow clears.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.001
What else?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.891
The Stormcrows rode off last night.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.931
Five hundred men.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.480
Sellswords.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.723
Loyal to nothing but gold.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.729
We still have a hard march to Winterfell,

16:14.800 --> 16:16.609
and we won't be marching anywhere
in this weather.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.321
And?

16:18.400 --> 16:19.890
This isn't our time.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.490
We should head back to Castle Black
when the snow clears.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.927
I retreated from King's Landing.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.402
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.608
- Your Grace...
- Winter is coming.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.843
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

16:34.920 --> 16:39.721
If we march back to Castle Black,
we winter at Castle Black.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.646
And who can say how many years
this winter will last?

16:43.720 --> 16:45.643
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.041
This is the right time,
and I will risk everything.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.521
Because if I don't, we've lost.

16:51.480 --> 16:56.771
We march to victory, or we march to defeat,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.921
but we go forward. Only forward.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.281
Your Grace.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.127
I've trusted in your visions,

17:19.200 --> 17:21.964
in your prophecies for years.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.925
You saw it yourself,
when you stared into the flames.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.243
A great battle in the snow.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.209
- I don't know what I saw.
- You do know.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.601
Trust yourself.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.804
And you? Do you trust yourself?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.131
I trust in the Lord.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.330
Are you sure?

17:46.680 --> 17:50.002
I have seen myself
walk along the battlements of Winterfell.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.321
I have seen the flayed man banners
lowered to the ground.

18:03.720 --> 18:07.122
But sometimes sacrifices must be made
to ensure victory.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.727
I have shown you the power of king's blood.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.131
The usurper, Robb Stark.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.449
The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.841
We don't have Robert's bastard here.

18:18.920 --> 18:19.921
No,

18:20.640 --> 18:21.880
we have someone better,

18:23.920 --> 18:26.321
and your blood runs through her veins.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.045
Have you lost your mind?

18:30.120 --> 18:31.690
Do you doubt me?

18:32.040 --> 18:33.405
Still?

18:34.360 --> 18:35.885
After all that you've seen.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.930
There must be another way.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.401
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.690
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.401
Only you can lead the
living against the dead.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.285
All your life has led us to this moment.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.769
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.647
Get out.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.329
There's always some sort of grub on.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.004
A bit of mutton would be nice.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.610
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.771
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?

19:32.840 --> 19:35.844
No, the question is,
"Is she pretty down south in the real world,

19:35.920 --> 19:37.888
"or is she pretty
'cause she's the only girl here?"

19:38.000 --> 19:39.809
Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.684
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.807
Leave me alone.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.769
Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.330
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.170
A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.601
There's no need to be rude.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.286
We just want a little affection.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.641
Ooh.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.801
Get your hands off her.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.446
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,

20:06.800 --> 20:08.484
I believe you both have guard duty tonight.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.170
Sam the Slayer.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.850
You gonna slay me with that sword?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.331
Look at his hand shake.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.289
Gilly, go on.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.489
Get back to your room, lock the door.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.048
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.167
Come on.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.161
Sam!

20:29.880 --> 20:32.008
You lying sack of shit.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.403
Killed a White Walker, eh?

20:34.480 --> 20:35.686
You fat-ass fuck.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.683
Come on, get up.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.051
- No!
- This your hero? This hog?

20:41.760 --> 20:42.841
Leave him alone!

20:44.320 --> 20:46.641
Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you?

20:48.640 --> 20:50.085
- Come on!
- No!

20:51.080 --> 20:53.890
- Sam!
- Come on!

21:02.680 --> 21:04.762
- Sam!
- Come on.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.001
Right.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.411
Hold still.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.760
- Turn her over.
- All right.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.691
I said, get your hands off her.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.285
You're gonna get yourself killed.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.806
Your lover Jon Snow's not here to save you.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.451
I killed a White Walker, I killed a Thenn.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.170
I'll take my chances with you.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.081
Sam!

21:48.560 --> 21:50.449
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.725
Just a bit woozy.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.491
The next time you see something like that,
you leave it alone.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.370
I will not. They would have...

22:26.600 --> 22:28.568
I don't know what they would have done.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.961
I know they would have killed you
if Ghost hadn't come.

22:31.040 --> 22:34.249
No. They were tiring out.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.928
I had them in the palm of my hand.

22:38.120 --> 22:42.409
Don't be stupid. You're not a fighter.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.725
What kind of man would I be

22:44.840 --> 22:46.808
if I ran away
when I saw someone hurting you?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.920
Just promise me,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.810
whatever happens,
you'll take care of Little Sam.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.730
But of course I will.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.601
And

22:57.800 --> 22:59.609
I'll take care of you, too.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.810
I need more water.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.806
Stay.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.764
Please.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.450
Am I hurting you?

24:21.800 --> 24:22.847
Are you sure?

24:53.280 --> 24:54.691
Oh, my!

25:11.920 --> 25:14.764
A rare find for the fighting pits,
my friend.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.449
Not your usual street
tough or drunken pirate.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.766
This one's a Westerosi knight

25:22.240 --> 25:26.211
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.

25:26.720 --> 25:31.089
He fought beside the stag king Robert
on the far side of the Narrow Sea.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.522
He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,

25:34.600 --> 25:37.888
slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.

25:37.960 --> 25:41.681
He killed the great Khal Drogo
in single combat.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.204
Betrayed by his woman,

25:44.280 --> 25:47.682
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.969
Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.566
Thirteen. Do I have 14?

25:55.800 --> 25:59.202
Fifteen? 15 gold honors.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.489
Do I hear 16? 16.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.324
Twenty.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.846
Sold.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.641
Wait!

26:17.080 --> 26:19.560
- You have to buy me as well.
- Why?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.245
We're a team.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.924
I'm a great fighter, too.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.967
He's funny. You have to give him that.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.441
You're right, he's funny.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.650
Thank you.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.767
Yes.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.288
My lord, if I may.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.801
I've heard Meereen has become a free city.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.645
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.848
Now, if you were to fight freed men
who'd be paid a wage...

27:23.440 --> 27:25.283
There's your wages, funny man.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.284
Should last the rest of your life.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.760
These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.130
Five, going once...

27:38.440 --> 27:41.842
How long before the King of Meereen
comes to claim my pillow?

27:41.920 --> 27:43.285
Don't be ridiculous.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.924
My marriage to Hizdahr is political.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.608
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.648
I think the Sons of the Harpy
have stopped killing

27:53.760 --> 27:55.922
because their leader was made king.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.570
Are you jealous?

28:01.720 --> 28:03.722
Do you think I'm petty enough to
speak ill of a man

28:03.800 --> 28:05.962
just because he represents competition?

28:06.920 --> 28:08.126
I do.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.730
You're right.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.371
My motivations are entirely impure.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.004
Doesn't make me wrong.

28:29.520 --> 28:33.889
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies within and without.

28:33.960 --> 28:38.443
So when enemies without come knocking,
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.931
I have no choice.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.325
Everyone has a choice.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.364
Even slaves have a choice,

28:44.480 --> 28:46.005
death or slavery.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.489
So what else can I do, hmm?

28:50.480 --> 28:51.925
Marry me instead.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.087
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

28:59.600 --> 29:01.443
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

29:02.160 --> 29:04.128
You are queen. You can do what you like.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.330
No, I can't.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.810
Then you are the only person in Meereen
who's not free.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.689
And I know I'm here to serve my queen
and not give advice,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.843
but can I make one more suggestion?

29:34.760 --> 29:35.761
Of course.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.409
On the day of the great games,

29:42.280 --> 29:47.207
gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters
and Worthy Masters you can find,

29:48.480 --> 29:49.845
and slaughter them all.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.007
I am a queen, not a butcher.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.883
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.527
You there.

30:14.760 --> 30:18.481
Where would I find
the High Septon, or High Sparrow,

30:18.560 --> 30:20.642
or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

30:21.080 --> 30:23.970
It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns,
I'll admit.

30:25.920 --> 30:30.164
You should have the decency
to stand when you speak to a lady.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.481
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.610
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.447
For me, it's the knees.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.649
- You?
- Hips.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.161
Ah.

30:44.720 --> 30:48.611
A man of the people. Is that your game?

30:48.880 --> 30:52.487
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.011
A man of the people

30:54.680 --> 30:57.331
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.362
The people always do the dirty work.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.569
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.041
Useful talent.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.964
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

31:08.080 --> 31:12.847
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.121
The Father judges us all.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.882
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.564
If you break his laws, you will be punished.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.565
Don't you walk away from me.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.768
You don't give commands here.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.285
What is it you want?

31:30.960 --> 31:32.200
Gold?

31:32.640 --> 31:35.405
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.246
What, then?

31:39.520 --> 31:41.488
I imagine this is strange for you.

31:42.560 --> 31:47.566
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive,
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.649
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.685
I serve the gods.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.883
The gods demand justice.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.447
How do they communicate their demands?

31:57.920 --> 31:59.126
By raven or horse?

31:59.200 --> 32:01.851
By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.962
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.566
I've read The Seven-Pointed Star.

32:08.640 --> 32:12.964
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.283
Your grandchildren will be punished

32:15.360 --> 32:20.002
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

32:20.080 --> 32:24.881
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

32:25.280 --> 32:28.329
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

32:28.400 --> 32:33.804
and yet you punish Loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce,

32:33.880 --> 32:36.042
and Margaery for defending her brother?

32:36.200 --> 32:37.531
Yes.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.446
The gods' laws must be
applied to all equally.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.248
If it's equality you want, so be it.

32:43.360 --> 32:47.285
When House Tyrell stops sending our crops
to the capital,

32:47.720 --> 32:49.563
everyone here will starve.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.641
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.531
Have you ever sowed the field?

33:00.800 --> 33:02.370
Have you ever reaped the grain?

33:04.040 --> 33:05.565
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

33:07.080 --> 33:10.562
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

33:12.760 --> 33:13.966
You are the few,

33:15.160 --> 33:16.730
we are the many.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.927
And when the many stop fearing the few...

33:36.200 --> 33:37.486
Lady Olenna.

33:49.760 --> 33:53.321
Starving yourself won't make things
any better for her, my love.

33:56.520 --> 34:01.287
She's in a prison cell,
and there is nothing I can do.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.564
I am the king!

34:06.640 --> 34:09.803
The queen is in prison,
and there is nothing I can do!

34:24.320 --> 34:26.208
No matter who you are,

34:27.960 --> 34:29.760
no matter how strong you are,
sooner or later,

34:29.800 --> 34:32.406
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

34:33.040 --> 34:37.170
Events you couldn't possibly have
anticipated or prevented, even if you had.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.601
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.931
Your father,

34:43.159 --> 34:44.571
your brother, your grandfather...

34:44.639 --> 34:47.246
I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,
and what could I do?

34:48.080 --> 34:49.844
Hold them as they left this world.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.489
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.922
I'll call in the army.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.564
I'll take back the sept,
and kill every last one of them.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.807
I'll start a war if I have to.

35:04.880 --> 35:08.327
You know as well as I do
who the first casualty of that war would be.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.726
I love her.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.765
I love her,

35:22.720 --> 35:24.165
and I can't help her.

35:40.480 --> 35:43.723
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.847
I will speak with the High Sparrow.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.640
There must be something he...

35:48.720 --> 35:50.529
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.927
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.324
You will try to help her?

35:58.600 --> 36:01.843
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.526
Your happiness is all I want in this world.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.286
I know.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.125
No, you don't.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.204
You can't possibly.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.328
Not until you have children of your own.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.050
I would do anything for you.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.204
Anything to keep you from harm.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.042
I would burn cities to the ground.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.684
You are all that matters.

36:35.600 --> 36:36.840
You

36:38.120 --> 36:39.360
and your sister.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.763
From the moment you came into this world.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.291
My boy.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.685
My only boy.

37:04.320 --> 37:08.609
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your
concerns about the princess' well-being.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.005
You looked different when I left.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.928
You had more hair.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.481
And more hands.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.846
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

37:25.920 --> 37:26.921
I'm sorry for that.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.531
It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.325
Why is it happening at all?

37:31.760 --> 37:33.683
Your mother's worried about you.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.251
Threats have been made.
Dame's too dangerous for you.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.682
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.886
This has been my home for years.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.599
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.

37:44.699 --> 37:45.767
I did what she said.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.605
I did my duty,
and now she's forcing me to go back?

37:48.680 --> 37:51.650
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.007
No, it's not complicated at all.
It's simple.

37:54.080 --> 37:57.971
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.804
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.441
You don't know me.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.364
Brothers, oh, brothers,
my days here are done

38:14.640 --> 38:18.850
The Dornishman's taken my life

38:19.520 --> 38:23.844
But what does it matter
For all men must die

38:23.920 --> 38:27.481
And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

38:27.560 --> 38:28.846
I have

38:28.920 --> 38:33.369
I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

38:36.680 --> 38:38.125
He's got a good voice.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.970
We're lucky he's a singer.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.327
If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.442
It's against my code to hurt a woman.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.603
It's amazing how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.290
I wouldn't say you beat me.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.087
How's your arm?

38:53.240 --> 38:54.571
Wonderful.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.006
Wouldn't feel right to leave Dome
without a new scar.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.205
You think you're leaving Dome?

39:00.680 --> 39:02.091
No great hurry.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.086
Dornish women
are the most beautiful women in the world.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.681
Thank you.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.604
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.800
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

39:16.480 --> 39:19.324
I've seen quite a few women
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

39:19.960 --> 39:22.645
Name one more beautiful than I am.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.290
Well, now,

39:26.680 --> 39:31.402
in King's Landing,
there was an absolutely gorgeous...

39:36.000 --> 39:37.126
There was a what?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.802
In King's Landing, you were saying?

39:42.560 --> 39:43.607
Was I?

39:45.320 --> 39:47.641
There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.491
Was there?

39:49.800 --> 39:51.962
My memory's not what it was earlier.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.801
How's your arm now?

39:57.320 --> 39:58.651
You seem concerned with it.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.650
You must really like me.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.920
And how about your head?

40:16.920 --> 40:18.570
My head.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.765
My head?

40:21.720 --> 40:24.530
You don't even want to know
what's going on in...

40:34.680 --> 40:36.205
Your nose is bleeding.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.205
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.968
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from Asshai.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.849
They call it the Long Farewell.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.051
It takes time to work,

40:54.840 --> 40:58.640
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

40:58.720 --> 40:59.721
death.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.043
The only antidote.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.481
Who's the most
beautiful woman in the world?

41:18.920 --> 41:20.251
You.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.565
Sorry? Who?

41:26.080 --> 41:27.081
You.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.407
Don't drop it.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.162
I think you're very handsome as well.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.606
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.971
It felt like the safest place.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.722
Not for your clientele, clearly.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.801
It was an establishment like no other.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.162
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.169
Desires that didn't even exist

42:51.160 --> 42:52.650
until we invented them.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.164
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

42:57.720 --> 42:59.165
The past is the past.

43:00.520 --> 43:03.922
The future is all that's worth discussing.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.045
The future of House Tyrell.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.771
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

43:09.840 --> 43:11.569
my grandchildren, or me.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.089
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

43:14.160 --> 43:16.686
as soon as things started to go wrong.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.967
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

43:19.400 --> 43:20.890
that our fates are joined.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.770
Together we murdered a king.

43:23.280 --> 43:26.329
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

43:27.640 --> 43:33.647
And if I should meet with some accident here
at your broken little flesh market,

43:34.600 --> 43:37.126
they'll never even find what's left of you.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.725
So...

43:40.400 --> 43:42.050
Do you deny a part in all this?

43:42.720 --> 43:45.291
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.081
I dared not refuse her.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.010
And what did she want?

43:49.120 --> 43:51.726
A piece of information she knew that I had.

43:52.280 --> 43:55.204
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.645
But I have other information

43:58.560 --> 43:59.925
of which she is unaware.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.284
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.806
I have a gift for you.

44:08.440 --> 44:09.771
What kind Of gift?

44:10.120 --> 44:11.770
The same kind I gave Cersei.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.005
A handsome young man.

44:29.240 --> 44:33.723
Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.410
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

44:37.480 --> 44:40.404
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.645
But if you do happen to triumph here,

44:43.720 --> 44:47.964
you will fight at the Great Pit of
Daznak itself, in front of the queen.

44:48.080 --> 44:51.926
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

44:52.680 --> 44:56.765
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.328
You and you. You.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.521
You two.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.325
You, you, and you.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.806
Up.

45:11.840 --> 45:14.650
- Valar Morghulis.
- Valar Dohaeris.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.960
Prepare yourselves.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.201
Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.170
For generations,
in the days leading up to the great games,

45:34.280 --> 45:37.648
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

45:37.720 --> 45:40.041
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.520
Move yourselves.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.605
Your Grace.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.360
Your future Grace.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.205
You honor us all.

46:01.440 --> 46:02.487
Stand there.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.842
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.489
We fight and die for your glory,

46:09.800 --> 46:11.245
O glorious queen.

46:14.280 --> 46:18.001
We fight and die for your glory,
O glorious queen.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.005
Fight!

47:20.960 --> 47:22.007
I think I've seen enough.

47:22.080 --> 47:25.163
Your Grace, it is a tradition

47:25.240 --> 47:28.164
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.044
I've sacrificed more than enough
for your traditions.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.601
What are you doing?

47:46.040 --> 47:47.929
Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.005
Get him out of my sight.

49:19.480 --> 49:21.323
Khaleesi, please.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.687
I just need a moment of your time.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.565
I brought you a gift.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.561
It's true.

49:29.760 --> 49:30.966
He has.

49:32.520 --> 49:33.806
Who are you?

49:35.320 --> 49:36.845
I am the gift.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.084
It's a pleasure to meet you.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.610
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.045
This is horrible.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.685
Unacceptable.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.763
Are they feeding you enough at least?

50:27.600 --> 50:28.931
I brought you this.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.521
Venison.

50:31.280 --> 50:32.611
It's quite good.

50:35.920 --> 50:38.810
I had it myself for supper only last night.

50:42.840 --> 50:46.162
We did everything we could
from the moment they took your brother.

50:46.240 --> 50:49.562
Tommen even went to the sept himself
to confront the High Sparrow.

50:50.840 --> 50:53.411
But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.448
I know you did this.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.531
We are making every effort on your behalf.

51:00.480 --> 51:02.721
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.280
Lies come easily to you.

51:05.360 --> 51:06.486
Everyone knows that.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.604
But innocence,

51:09.600 --> 51:11.648
decency, concern,

51:12.600 --> 51:14.648
you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

51:16.320 --> 51:20.564
Perhaps that's why your son was
so eager to cast you aside for me.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.326
You're upset.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.684
You're not thinking clearly.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.527
I'll visit again when you've had a chance
to calm down.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.603
I don't want to see you again.

51:31.680 --> 51:33.967
I do hope you change your mind about that.

51:34.600 --> 51:38.161
I've been told men often go mad
in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.

51:39.240 --> 51:42.449
Though I suppose your isolation will end
when your trial begins.

51:44.720 --> 51:45.881
Leave.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.806
Yes.

51:48.560 --> 51:51.848
I'm afraid I must.
My son needs me now more than ever.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.483
Get out, you hateful bitch!

52:08.880 --> 52:10.166
Sleep well, sister.

52:38.560 --> 52:39.641
Thank you, Boake.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.610
- You saw her?
- Yes.

52:49.080 --> 52:51.287
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.566
What happens to her now?

52:53.920 --> 52:57.447
Well, she and her brother are both
being held under fair suspicion.

52:58.160 --> 53:03.451
A trial will be held for each of them
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

53:03.520 --> 53:07.241
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets of the faith.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.090
Who will stand judge?

53:09.160 --> 53:13.370
Seven septons, as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

53:14.760 --> 53:15.921
Will you be one of them?

53:16.600 --> 53:17.965
I will.

53:19.960 --> 53:24.363
If one or both of them were to
confess before the trial...

53:24.440 --> 53:26.204
Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.

53:27.480 --> 53:29.448
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

53:30.440 --> 53:32.408
It depends upon the situation.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.730
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.643
Thank you, High Septon,

53:38.680 --> 53:41.160
for bringing them
whatever justice they deserve

53:42.480 --> 53:43.845
in the eyes of the Seven.

53:48.560 --> 53:51.245
Did you know this chapel is
one of the oldest structures

53:51.320 --> 53:52.446
in King's Landing?

53:54.280 --> 53:56.044
I think I may have heard at one point.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.768
Baelor built his sept around it.

54:00.760 --> 54:03.240
But men worshipped here long before him.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.090
Who carved this altar?

54:07.040 --> 54:09.008
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

54:10.400 --> 54:11.811
No one does.

54:12.680 --> 54:16.002
There's no name on it,
or anywhere else in the chapel.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.402
No, the people who built this place

54:20.840 --> 54:24.367
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them,

54:24.960 --> 54:28.885
the way Baelor did
with that great gilded monstrosity up there.

54:28.960 --> 54:29.961
Hmm.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.170
Their faith was clean.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.525
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

54:37.360 --> 54:39.567
knock down the statues and the pillars,

54:40.640 --> 54:42.165
and this is what remains.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.603
Something simple,

54:51.200 --> 54:54.602
solid, and true.

54:59.400 --> 55:02.483
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

55:03.480 --> 55:08.042
Their lies knocked down.
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.809
And so it will be for all of us.

55:12.760 --> 55:14.842
High and low alike.

55:19.480 --> 55:20.925
What will We find

55:21.880 --> 55:24.247
when we strip away your finery?

55:27.760 --> 55:30.491
A young man came to us not long ago,

55:31.840 --> 55:33.683
broken in body and spirit.

55:36.240 --> 55:38.402
He had so much to strip away.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.244
So much weighing him down.

55:44.120 --> 55:47.283
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.290
Let go of vanity,

55:50.920 --> 55:53.002
pride, sin.

55:55.800 --> 55:57.689
Now his soul is so light,

55:58.440 --> 56:01.649
he will float through
the seven heavens like a bird.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.041
Hmm.

56:08.560 --> 56:10.927
And he has much to say about you.

56:34.920 --> 56:35.921
Move.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.527
Let me go immediately.

56:42.320 --> 56:44.322
You will order her to let me go.

56:44.760 --> 56:47.286
I am the queen!

56:47.360 --> 56:49.044
Have you lost your mind?

56:49.480 --> 56:50.481
Let me go!

56:52.440 --> 56:56.001
...your filthy hands off me!
Are you out of your mind?

56:56.800 --> 56:59.406
I am the queen! Let me go!

57:06.000 --> 57:07.365
Look at me.

57:10.120 --> 57:11.565
Look at my face.

57:14.520 --> 57:17.205
It's the last thing you'll
see before you die.
