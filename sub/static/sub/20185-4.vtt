01:02.228 --> 01:04.629
My, my.

01:06.433 --> 01:09.568
Comanches?

01:09.570 --> 01:13.072
It would appear so.

01:13.074 --> 01:17.443
I daresay the Texas rangers will
enjoy a bit of sport today.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.935
Hyah!

02:49.937 --> 02:53.205
Go with escute! Go!

03:19.867 --> 03:22.801
It's a hell of a time
to be singing.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.803
It's his death song.

03:33.446 --> 03:37.783
They all compose one
for such a time as this.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.297
Pete.

04:30.737 --> 04:33.438
There's something terrible
about to happen,

04:33.440 --> 04:36.008
and I need you to help me
stop it.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.010
Okay, tell me.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.583
We appreciate you making
the trip down here, Mr. bates.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.553
last time your daddy
sent for me on short notice,

04:48.555 --> 04:49.855
was the day you was born.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.957
So I figured
it had to be important.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.525
Look out!

04:53.527 --> 04:54.826
Texas rangers are here!

04:54.828 --> 04:57.462
Eli! You old son of a buck.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.631
You don't look a day over 60.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.667
That's very kind of you to say.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.703
Whiskey is a great preservative.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.006
You know, the first person
to ever at shoot me

05:08.008 --> 05:09.775
was a Texas ranger,

05:09.777 --> 05:12.744
probably your grandpa,
bigfoot Wallace himself.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.079
You know...

05:14.081 --> 05:15.914
I don't think so.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.717
Old bigfoot... he never fired
a gun, he didn't kill something.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.354
Sit down, take the weight off.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.826
My boy Pete was tipped off
about a stash of tools

05:27.828 --> 05:31.330
out there where
the old indio ferry used to run.

05:32.932 --> 05:36.435
Pete?

05:36.437 --> 05:40.005
There was a whole load of
mallets and picks and iron bars,

05:40.007 --> 05:41.673
where the del rio line runs
along the river.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.077
We figure they mean
to derail the train.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.614
Son of a bitch.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.083
How many was killed

05:51.085 --> 05:52.818
when they derailed that train
from brownsville?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.020
Couple dozen.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.956
Passenger line runs
twice a week.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.025
Next one's tomorrow.

06:02.061 --> 06:06.665
Pete, where you gettin' all this
crackerjack information?

06:08.701 --> 06:11.570
Reliable source.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.606
How reliable?

06:14.608 --> 06:17.008
I saw it all myself, hiram.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.980
Well...

06:23.850 --> 06:26.818
I reckon we ought
to gather us up a posse.

06:34.527 --> 06:38.397
Do you really think this is
a good idea?

06:38.399 --> 06:40.932
<i>Stopping innocent people gettin'
killed by the sediciosos?</i>

06:40.934 --> 06:43.435
It's fairly necessary,
to say the least.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.104
I'm talkin' about you.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.775
This is a job for the sheriff
or the army.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.077
Well, this is how
we're doin' it.

06:55.815 --> 07:00.051
The other night...
You scared me.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.988
You shouldn't have followed me.
It was none of your business.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.994
All right.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.530
I'm sorry I scared you.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.865
Stay home.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.067
Please.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.136
They can do this without you.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.839
You think I want this?
I don't have a choice.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.741
Why not?

07:22.743 --> 07:25.210
I'm his son.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.585
You ladies ready?!

07:33.587 --> 07:35.821
Let's kill some bandits!

07:41.060 --> 07:43.195
- Missed your first shootout?
- Yeah.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.897
Yeah.
Still, I'll be saving your ass.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.568
That's only 'cause he's got
the Lewis gun.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.504
Hey. Hold up there, Charles.
Where do you think you're going?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.039
I'm going with y'all.
I know what's going on.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.574
You got a posse.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.811
Giddyap!

07:59.813 --> 08:03.048
You ain't going nowhere.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.649
Come on, dad.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.587
No, get back in that house.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.056
Yes, sir.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.767
I ask you, what has
the Mexican improved?

08:22.769 --> 08:24.135
Nothing.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.971
What lies south
of our blood-slaked border

08:25.973 --> 08:28.206
but a mass of indigents

08:28.208 --> 08:32.110
whose only avocations
are popery and violence?

08:32.111 --> 08:36.581
Show me the Mexicans'
contribution to civilization.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.049
What is the Mexicans'
cotton gin?

08:39.052 --> 08:42.153
Where might I find
the Mexicans' lightbulb?

08:42.155 --> 08:46.958
Who is the Mexicans' socrates?

08:46.960 --> 08:50.095
Abandon hope, fellow travelers,

08:50.097 --> 08:51.930
for now we trespass upon

08:51.932 --> 08:55.700
the unimproved acreage
of señor garcía,

08:55.702 --> 08:58.003
who sits in his manse,

08:58.005 --> 09:01.907
hoarding his gold
like some toothless old dragon.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.843
Niles, shut your damn mouth.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.313
That goes for everybody!
Zip it up!

09:08.315 --> 09:11.316
I'd like to live out the week.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.050
Your people
are not welcome here.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.386
Go on! It's a free country.

10:21.388 --> 10:25.323
<i>- I said go!
- Ignacio! Ven acá!</i>

10:25.325 --> 10:26.891
You people are murderers!

10:28.862 --> 10:31.630
Pedro, I'm so sorry.
My son didn't mean to stare.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.398
And we are very sorry
for what you're going through.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.266
You're not sorry!
You killed him!

10:35.268 --> 10:37.202
<i>Icállate la boca!</i>

10:39.872 --> 10:42.741
No, we are sorry,
Mrs. McCullough.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.343
Forgive my child.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.846
This is a difficult time
for us all.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.019
Mama, you're hurtin' my arm!

10:58.157 --> 11:00.291
Jeannie, come on.
We're going home.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.762
Jeannie.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.718
Charles!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.253
Shit.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.956
Get those guns down.
It's my boy.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.159
What the hell is wrong with you?

11:34.161 --> 11:36.094
Daddy, it's okay. It's okay?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.796
I nearly put a bullet
through your heart.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.999
You think that's okay?
You think that's okay?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.467
Get down.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.772
What the hell are you thinking?

11:54.781 --> 11:56.715
You're gonna get back on that
horse and you're gonna ride home.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.484
It's too late for him
to ride home alone.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.320
You're kidding me.
We're on garcía land now.

12:02.322 --> 12:06.291
<i>Half the garcía vaqueros
are in with the sediciosos.</i>

12:07.048 --> 12:08.427
It's safer for him here

12:08.428 --> 12:12.831
than to get bushwhacked
riding home in the dark.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.104
Go water your horse.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.392
We gotta get that boy's head
on straight.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.061
Even when you were half his age,

12:43.063 --> 12:46.998
you knew better than to
walk into a goddamned ambush.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.068
Well, it ain't an accident
I'm teaching him different.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.132
Well, there you have it.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.001
Everything you need to derail
a train.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.538
These are the only shallows
for a couple of miles.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.541
They'll cross in the morning
before the train comes through.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.509
We'll dig in
up along the Ridge there,

13:31.511 --> 13:34.179
make camp about
a half a mile back.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.980
We'll catch 'em in the water.

13:35.982 --> 13:39.017
The fires of hell
ought to dry 'em off nicely.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.421
Enough jawing.
Let's get to work.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.587
Come on.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.033
It's broken.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.182
You sure you don't want
some help?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.570
What? Is it your back?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.414
- Yah!
- Shh. Shh.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.349
Shh.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.551
Shh, shh.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.301
You're a good horse.

17:19.104 --> 17:22.339
You didn't deserve this.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.443
Just lay still,
and it'll be over, okay?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.579
Shh.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.354
Think about all those girls you
got back there waiting on you.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.723
waiting to nurse you
back to health.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.595
What is it?

18:22.168 --> 18:23.801
Okay, don't stop.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.369
You gotta stay awake, escute.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.677
That's a good idea.
Keep singing.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.345
You gotta stay awake, escute.

18:39.752 --> 18:43.121
Keep singing. Keep singing.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.367
Boys have been working fast.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.136
They're the best men in Texas.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.706
You get Sullivan and Neptune to
put one more foxhole up there.

19:03.609 --> 19:07.512
I think we should build through
up there.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.350
Hey, one more.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.751
That's it.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.312
I'm worried about Charles.

19:41.314 --> 19:45.416
Relax, son. We got pickets
posted in every position.

19:45.418 --> 19:50.221
Pizaña shows up early,
we'll be ready for 'em.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.889
It ain't exactly pizaña
I'm worried about.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.329
Who was it told you about
the attack?

20:00.232 --> 20:01.899
Cesar?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.568
No.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.677
You back with
that garcía girl again?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.245
What?

20:14.247 --> 20:16.847
We're here because of something
she told you.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.449
Ain't that a fact?

20:18.451 --> 20:21.586
No, it is not.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.888
Anyhow, all that ended
a long time ago.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.224
Pete. She has got nothing
to do with any of it.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.993
You just put that out
of your mind.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.312
Everything all right at home?

20:48.314 --> 20:49.814
It's fine.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.488
I feel some responsibility.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.424
Do you now? Hell, yeah.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.794
If you hadn't married Sally, you
would have ended up with Maria.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.664
I know that.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.366
Things would have turned out
a whole lot different.

21:08.368 --> 21:12.937
Well, they didn't. You wanted me
to marry Sally, so I did.

21:16.276 --> 21:19.677
You could have said no.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.587
What's behind all this, daddy?
What are you gettin' at?

21:29.589 --> 21:34.458
It's such a surprise
I care what happens to you?

21:38.030 --> 21:39.964
I do.

21:59.685 --> 22:04.822
My mother taught me
how to sew and to cook.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.391
Maybe you can mend Sullivan's
panties while you're at it.

22:07.393 --> 22:10.728
Sullivan sews his own panties.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.330
You know I do.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.432
When I get done
massacring this jacket,

22:14.434 --> 22:16.100
I'll take a nickel a sock.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.383
You ain't sittin' here.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.752
Nonsense, Louis.

22:34.754 --> 22:38.689
Neptune here
is a comrade in arms.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.493
A brother in blood.

22:42.495 --> 22:47.498
You take a load off, Neptune,
please.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.467
Thank you kindly, Mr. Gilbert.

23:03.815 --> 23:06.450
Pass that bottle on, Louis.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.128
Manners, Louis.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.015
Niles and them was sharing
battle stories.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.788
You know, Neptune fought
with the army

23:43.790 --> 23:45.990
down in the Philippines.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.826
A real-life buffalo soldier?

23:48.828 --> 23:52.530
Yes, sir. Ninth cavalry.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.665
How many moros you kill?

23:54.667 --> 23:56.200
Six I know about.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.836
Whoo!

23:58.838 --> 24:01.539
Such derring-do.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.041
Runs in the blood, I guess.

24:06.745 --> 24:10.047
Tell me about your people,
Neptune.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.116
Back in Africa.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.452
Are they savage as reported?

24:14.454 --> 24:16.821
Don't know the first thing
about Africa.

24:18.858 --> 24:22.059
What about your people,
Mr. Gilbert?

24:22.061 --> 24:23.928
They savage as reported?

24:23.930 --> 24:26.230
The Gilberts?

24:26.232 --> 24:30.067
We're, indeed, fightin' stock.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.503
First to defend against
northern aggression

24:32.505 --> 24:35.139
when sumter lit up.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.109
And how'd they fare
after the war?

24:41.714 --> 24:44.148
Yankees took everything.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.117
Sharecroppin' is a fixed game,

24:47.119 --> 24:50.754
as rigged and treacherous
as any roulette wheel.

24:50.756 --> 24:53.491
Hell you say.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.626
My people were
sharecroppers, too,

24:55.628 --> 24:58.829
after they was finished
being slaves, of course.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.801
Curious world, ain't it?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.236
Sherman burns everything,

25:05.238 --> 25:08.973
and your family and mine
come out equal in poverty.

25:11.244 --> 25:13.544
'Course, that changed
the day the colonel came along

25:13.546 --> 25:16.881
and started paying my daddy
a decent wage.

25:18.183 --> 25:22.286
I daresay it elevated
our station.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.234
I like you, Neptune.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.272
You and me...

25:41.274 --> 25:44.708
We stand on the same footing.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.944
We're the working poor.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.913
We can't all of us be high-born.

25:48.915 --> 25:52.249
The mcculloughs fought
for every last thing they got.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.653
Lord, don't mishear me.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.922
We all revere the mcculloughs.

25:57.924 --> 26:01.959
Just a name to live up to.

26:01.961 --> 26:05.195
Good for you, Charles.

26:05.197 --> 26:09.567
Good for you,
coming to defend what's yours.

26:11.036 --> 26:13.337
I ain't done nothing yet.

26:13.339 --> 26:17.841
<i>And that makes you</i>

26:17.843 --> 26:20.778
pure potential, son.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.846
Unlit dynamite.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.352
Charles.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.888
Let's go.
Time to feed the ponies.

26:51.142 --> 26:53.611
Stay away from niles Gilbert.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.145
Why? He seems harmless enough.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.914
He's far from harmless.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.350
He's only here 'cause he likes
the idea of shooting Mexicans.

26:59.352 --> 27:03.020
Hell, I like the idea
of shooting Mexicans.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.656
It hurts me when you talk
like that. You understand?

27:05.658 --> 27:07.725
Yeah.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.695
Yeah.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.168
Good.

27:41.793 --> 27:47.231
The stuff your granddaddy and I
did still keeps me up at night.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.167
Well, if the people you did
it to deserved it, who cares?

27:55.040 --> 27:57.041
You're gonna keep your head
down tomorrow.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.976
No, da... listen to me, Charles.

27:58.978 --> 28:02.046
I want you to stay behind
at camp.

28:02.048 --> 28:05.115
You've got too much family
buried out here already.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.970
Charles?

28:26.972 --> 28:28.238
Charles?

28:30.443 --> 28:31.942
Have either of you seen
your brother?

28:31.944 --> 28:33.711
He was supposed to feed
the animals.

28:33.713 --> 28:37.281
I'll feed 'em. I can't read
with this racket.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.716
Well, I don't like playing it

28:38.718 --> 28:40.350
any more than you like
listening to it.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.119
Listening to it's way worse.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.354
Be kind, Jonas.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.723
All that practice will pay off

28:45.725 --> 28:49.026
when she finally masters
the instrument.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.028
I ain't mastering squat.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.168
Jeannie!

29:01.306 --> 29:04.942
That's enough for your lessons.
Go find a book to read.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.243
Okay, mama.

29:11.116 --> 29:14.051
Honey?

29:14.053 --> 29:15.285
Do I have to?

29:16.354 --> 29:19.890
Relaxes me.

29:19.892 --> 29:23.460
All right, what do you want
to hear?

29:23.462 --> 29:25.295
Something gentle.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.339
Mama?

29:40.512 --> 29:44.348
Why do the garcías think
we killed Cesar?

29:53.124 --> 29:55.192
Well, when bad things happen,

29:55.194 --> 29:58.262
it's human nature to look
for someone to blame.

29:58.264 --> 30:01.031
We need to be like Jesus
and turn the other cheek.

30:03.201 --> 30:06.436
But why do they pick on us?
We must have done something.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.472
Don't talk stupid, Jonas.

30:08.474 --> 30:12.142
Maybe granddaddy did something
to them we don't know about.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.877
The colonel spends all his time

30:13.879 --> 30:16.313
working to make a good life
for us.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.016
You say one word against him,
I'll bust your nose open.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.452
Bug! Don't talk
to your brother that way.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.989
I just don't like to see him
upset you, mama.

30:46.478 --> 30:47.578
Escute!

30:50.115 --> 30:52.282
Escute!

30:55.187 --> 30:56.887
Shit.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.578
Yeah.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.417
Can't sleep.

31:33.424 --> 31:36.326
Thank you.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.429
For what?

31:39.431 --> 31:42.165
Escute died.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.368
But you tried to help him.

31:48.339 --> 31:51.441
He could have died alone
or been desecrated.

31:51.443 --> 31:56.346
If they had scalped him, he
couldn't enter the next world.

31:56.348 --> 32:00.217
Now...

32:00.219 --> 32:02.352
Now he's in a better place.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.603
You did yourself
a great honor today.

32:19.605 --> 32:23.573
Tomorrow, when we bury escute,

32:23.575 --> 32:26.443
I want you to push him
from his horse.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.524
Smoke with me.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.353
Shh, shh.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.123
Shh, shh, shh!

34:55.226 --> 34:56.760
Shh.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.563
Shh, shh.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.804
Shh.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.341
Shh, shh.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.241
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!
Okay.

36:18.243 --> 36:20.243
Hey!

36:22.648 --> 36:23.847
Go, go!

36:35.193 --> 36:36.693
Don't let 'em cross that river!

36:41.934 --> 36:43.767
Keep 'em on the other side!

36:43.769 --> 36:45.702
You got it!

36:59.283 --> 37:00.517
Aah!

37:00.519 --> 37:01.885
No!

37:01.887 --> 37:05.255
What, you expect them not
to shoot back?

37:05.257 --> 37:06.723
Get in it, Louis!

37:13.831 --> 37:16.700
I'm out, I'm out!

37:22.873 --> 37:25.442
Two behind the horse!

37:25.710 --> 37:28.278
Right over there,
two behind the horse!

37:30.916 --> 37:32.616
Too low!

37:36.287 --> 37:37.721
Give 'em hell, Neptune!

38:20.564 --> 38:23.333
Yeah!

38:25.404 --> 38:28.938
Attaboy, boys!

38:28.940 --> 38:31.007
Yee-haw!

38:31.009 --> 38:32.742
Goddamn!

38:32.744 --> 38:35.879
Sullivan, you son of a gun, you!

38:37.649 --> 38:39.849
Aah!

38:39.851 --> 38:42.385
Sullivan! Sullivan!
Come on, Sullivan!

38:42.387 --> 38:44.654
You can't go down!
Come on, Sullivan!

38:44.656 --> 38:46.656
Come on, get up, get up.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.491
Come on. My head hurts.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.627
Sullivan, your head's so hard,

38:50.629 --> 38:52.329
the goddamned bullet
bounced clean off.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.331
It sure don't
feel like it, Neptune.

38:54.333 --> 38:58.535
Yeah, just about
scalped you, but you ain't dead.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.637
Well, who's the son of a bitch
that shot me?

39:00.639 --> 39:03.807
Greaser girl. Pete got her.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.777
Thanks, kid.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.479
Owe you one.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.417
It's all right, son.

39:14.419 --> 39:15.885
You had to.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.823
You see that one's holster?
Give it here.

39:19.825 --> 39:23.493
A shame to let it go to waste.

39:38.442 --> 39:41.010
Whoo, look at that!

39:41.012 --> 39:43.913
I know it's rough, son,

39:43.915 --> 39:45.782
but you did the right thing.

39:45.784 --> 39:49.686
Charles, turn that
señorita's head this way.

39:55.025 --> 39:58.661
Come on, come on.
Come over here.

39:59.797 --> 40:01.464
Do you really think that
what the world needs

40:01.466 --> 40:02.932
is more people like us?

40:05.403 --> 40:07.404
It's a war, son.

40:07.406 --> 40:11.040
That's all it is.
It's just a war.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.610
It's a war we're helping
to start.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.984
Makes my head hurt
is what it does.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.886
How's that head there, Sully?

40:56.888 --> 40:59.689
I tell you what.
I thank god for a thick skull.

40:59.691 --> 41:02.225
It's thick, all right.

41:02.227 --> 41:05.462
Only I have to wake up
to your ugly face.

41:13.771 --> 41:16.873
Are you okay? Yeah.

41:19.711 --> 41:22.045
I'm fine.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.147
What happened out there?

41:33.591 --> 41:35.492
Maybe ease up.

41:47.571 --> 41:49.906
I am on your side.
