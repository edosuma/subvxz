WEBVTT

00:01.195 --> 00:03.258
Today is local vendors day.

00:03.602 --> 00:05.721
This is Cloud 9's way of supporting

00:05.723 --> 00:07.571
the local small business owners

00:07.968 --> 00:10.502
we're constantly putting
out of business.

00:10.504 --> 00:13.272
And this year,
we have a very special vendor.

00:13.274 --> 00:16.742
Just look at these
beautiful needlepoints.

00:16.744 --> 00:19.178
This is certainly an exciting product.

00:19.180 --> 00:20.229
Glenn, we all know that's your wife.

00:20.231 --> 00:21.552
No, no, it isn't.

00:21.553 --> 00:25.321
She is just a talented
craftswoman who is gracing us

00:25.323 --> 00:26.456
with her presence.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.191
Thank you, kind sir.

00:28.193 --> 00:30.693
I appreciate the opportunity
with to sell my crafts

00:30.695 --> 00:32.061
in your lovely store.

00:32.063 --> 00:34.180
Well, the pleasure is all ours.

00:34.182 --> 00:38.468
It's just so exciting to have
such a beautiful stranger

00:38.470 --> 00:39.869
at our vendor fair.

00:39.871 --> 00:42.939
- What's happening?
- I think it's foreplay.

00:42.941 --> 00:44.740
Glenn, are you gonna tell
your wife that you're flirting

00:44.742 --> 00:45.975
with one of the vendors?

00:45.977 --> 00:47.844
Oh, I don't think she'll mind.

00:47.846 --> 00:50.580
Oh, so you guys have an open marriage.

00:51.634 --> 00:52.150
What's that?

00:52.151 --> 00:53.483
It means you're allowed to have sex

00:53.485 --> 00:55.384
with people who aren't your spouse.

00:55.386 --> 00:57.453
It's like the Walkers.

00:57.721 --> 00:59.287
Oh. Oh, oh, God, no!

00:59.289 --> 01:01.479
Then why are you trying
to get at the vendor lady?

01:01.480 --> 01:03.592
Are you cheating on Jerusha?

01:03.594 --> 01:05.227
You know what? I'm gonna call her.

01:05.229 --> 01:06.711
No, don't call her.

01:06.713 --> 01:08.041
She deserves to know.

01:08.389 --> 01:09.534
Don't answer that!

Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:20.057 --> 01:22.149
$8 for a bar of soap

01:22.150 --> 01:24.446
just 'cause it's shaped weird
and wrapped in twine?

01:24.448 --> 01:26.815
Well, it's artisanal. It's organic.

01:28.085 --> 01:29.918
Ugh. I don't need my soap to be organic.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.319
We have science now.

01:31.321 --> 01:33.999
Science has created chemicals
that keep us clean.

01:34.491 --> 01:36.814
Handcrafted locally sourced beer.

01:36.815 --> 01:38.326
What does that even mean?

01:38.328 --> 01:40.219
Well, what makes
a microbrew special is...

01:40.220 --> 01:42.087
Know what? That actually
looks kind of interesting.

01:42.089 --> 01:43.153
I think I'm gonna check it out.

01:43.154 --> 01:45.064
Oh, because of the, uh, the cute girl?

01:45.065 --> 01:47.082
No, 'cause it's ardisenal.

01:47.563 --> 01:48.650
Did you just say "ardisenal"?

01:48.651 --> 01:50.695
Whatever, man. Leave me alone.

01:55.397 --> 01:58.431
Well, things are going
well with beverage guy.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.125
I mean, he waves, you wave.

02:00.636 --> 02:02.456
Yeah, we've been on a couple dates.

02:02.457 --> 02:04.023
He's... he's sweet.

02:04.117 --> 02:07.333
Wow, I bet dating has changed
so much since your time.

02:07.771 --> 02:11.439
How did you guys even send each
other naked photos of yourselves?

02:11.440 --> 02:12.677
Uh, just in the mail.

02:12.817 --> 02:14.600
Oh, my God. So much effort.

02:15.548 --> 02:16.904
I sent a nude fax once.

02:17.019 --> 02:18.285
- Full face?
- Full face.

02:18.288 --> 02:20.528
I mean, an artist signs her work.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074

02:30.033 --> 02:33.268
Dina, hey. I made something for you.

02:33.270 --> 02:35.570
Just as, you know,
a little thank-you for,

02:35.572 --> 02:38.703
you know, the gift that you're
giving to Glenn and me.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.678
- Wow.
- It's a stork.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.480
'Cause you're bringing us a baby.

02:45.482 --> 02:48.721
Gosh, what intricate work.

02:49.019 --> 02:50.785
Yeah, it took me over 30 hours.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.862
Amazing. Yeah.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.774
You know what?
I actually can't accept this.

02:56.776 --> 03:00.378
No offense, but it just
really freaks me out.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.412
And I do not want this in my home.

03:02.861 --> 03:04.632
Or, to be honest, on the planet.

03:04.634 --> 03:07.832
- Thanks.
- Oh, okay.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.162
Wow. Can't believe you
came on your day off

03:11.248 --> 03:13.508
to sell cheese you made
out of breast milk.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.577
Yeah, well, it's been a lot
of trial and error.

03:15.579 --> 03:17.599
You know, if you don't get
the consistency just right,

03:17.600 --> 03:18.880
you get boob yogurt,

03:18.882 --> 03:20.215
and that's just gross.

03:20.217 --> 03:21.716
And then there's the scavenging.

03:21.718 --> 03:23.718
Oh, and then my lizard
ate a bunch of my samples.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.254
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's go back to scavenging.

03:26.256 --> 03:28.256
Well, I mainly work with found milk.

03:28.746 --> 03:30.031
- Found milk?
- Mm-hmm.

03:30.032 --> 03:32.644
You know, a mom leaves a bottle
on a table at a food court and,

03:33.246 --> 03:36.395
you figure she's okay with people
taking a little off the top.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.878
Ever since the storm, he's
become the most amazing hider.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.793
Sometimes I can't find him for days.

03:52.051 --> 03:53.951
That's great.

03:54.117 --> 03:55.881
Hey, were you guys talking about Jerry?

03:55.882 --> 03:57.252
Yeah, this weekend,

03:57.254 --> 03:58.490
we're taking the rails off the toilet.

03:58.491 --> 04:01.657
Yeah, hey, you know what'd be
really good for his recovery?

04:01.858 --> 04:05.329
A nice cozy scarf from Jerusha's booth.

04:06.936 --> 04:10.065
Better get over there fast, you
know, before she sells out.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.620
Oh, did... did you want
us to go right now?

04:16.649 --> 04:18.704
Whoa, someone's excited.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.252
Yeah, go ahead.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.012
But, uh...

04:25.887 --> 04:28.321
Uh, yep. Okay, let's go.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.866
Whoa, I am jealous of you.

04:33.189 --> 04:37.225
I like the label.
It's very, uh, artisanal.

04:37.227 --> 04:40.191
Thanks, yeah. Would you like a taste?

04:41.932 --> 04:43.506
- All right, cheers.
- Cheers.

04:46.269 --> 04:47.322
Mmm, it, uh...

04:48.373 --> 04:49.483
wow, it tastes like Bud Light.

04:49.484 --> 04:51.673
You're funny.

04:51.675 --> 04:54.809
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm definitely
a little bit of a crack-up but,

04:54.958 --> 04:57.345
this is Bud Light, right?

04:57.347 --> 05:01.115
No. I guess if you're not
used to drinking craft beer,

05:01.117 --> 05:03.618
it might take a little time
for your palate to adjust.

05:03.620 --> 05:06.220
Or it might be Bud Light.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.052
Hmm.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.075
You know, if you buy
just one more scarf,

05:10.715 --> 05:12.224
you get a free other scarf.

05:13.751 --> 05:14.736
Um...

05:16.164 --> 05:18.328
Sure. Let's do it.

05:18.539 --> 05:19.877
So it seems like, uh,

05:20.337 --> 05:22.550
Jerusha's sales seem to be
picking up a little bit, huh?

05:22.551 --> 05:26.228
Yeah. God, I am so proud of her.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.183
'Cause, you know, needlepoint
comes easy to a lot of people.

05:30.235 --> 05:32.352
But not Jerusha.

05:32.630 --> 05:34.596
I just can't help but wonder
if some of the employees

05:34.598 --> 05:37.984
might feel a little pressured,
you know, to buy her stuff.

05:38.398 --> 05:40.298
I'm not pressuring anyone.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.070
No, of course not, but there's...

05:42.072 --> 05:44.306
yeah, I think there's
an inherent coercive power

05:44.308 --> 05:46.061
that you wield over the employees,

05:46.062 --> 05:47.852
even... even if you're
not conscious of it.

05:47.853 --> 05:49.344
Yeah, sure, sure, but you know,

05:49.346 --> 05:52.045
I think if I was doing
something subconsciously,

05:52.046 --> 05:52.895
I'd know it.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.268
Right. Yeah.

05:55.269 --> 05:57.638
Yeah, I just, you know... I think, uh...

05:58.060 --> 05:59.348
I think what I'm saying is,

05:59.349 --> 06:01.569
just be careful how you use your power.

06:02.343 --> 06:06.062
Maybe you should be careful
how you use your power...

06:06.969 --> 06:07.913
Handsome.

06:13.342 --> 06:15.260
- Wow.
- Hey.

06:15.339 --> 06:17.687
Did you design this?
This is very impressive.

06:17.688 --> 06:19.142
It came to me in a dream.

06:19.143 --> 06:20.342
A really boring dream.

06:20.344 --> 06:21.776
And it is taking forever.

06:21.777 --> 06:23.855
Well, you know, if you get hungry,

06:24.081 --> 06:26.060
I highly recommend the mini burritos.

06:26.061 --> 06:28.552
I've had, like... like, one.

06:28.654 --> 06:29.784
I don't know, there's
something lame about a

06:29.785 --> 06:32.354
burnout white dude making
money off Mexican food.

06:32.356 --> 06:35.127
Yeah, but in fairness to Burrito Brian,

06:35.128 --> 06:36.892
I don't think he's making any money.

06:36.894 --> 06:39.094
And I'm pretty sure
he sleeps in his van.

06:39.096 --> 06:41.129
And he did spend some
time in Costa Rica.

06:41.131 --> 06:42.600
Burritos aren't from Costa Rica.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.922
Yeah, no, I know. Obviously.

06:45.047 --> 06:47.421
They're from other places.

06:47.422 --> 06:48.198
Be careful.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.193
I'm gonna have to take
away your Latina card.

06:51.505 --> 06:53.537
Yeah, my Latina card.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.160
Here you go. Take it.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.909
No, um, that's a picture of a kid.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.313
I found this on the sidewalk

06:59.314 --> 07:01.699
and I felt really weird
about throwing it away.

07:03.547 --> 07:06.299
If you were to describe me...
you know, like,

07:06.300 --> 07:09.635
"Amy is the blank one,"
what would you say?

07:09.635 --> 07:12.352
Amy is the bossy one.

07:12.354 --> 07:14.004
Oh, Amy's the divorced one.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.607
Amy's the mad one. The loud one.

07:16.609 --> 07:18.258
Ooh, the sad one.

07:18.260 --> 07:21.044
- Oh, I could see that.
- No, something more obvious.

07:21.046 --> 07:23.480
Like... like about my identity.

07:23.482 --> 07:25.983
- Like, what am I?
- Oh, the short one.

07:26.253 --> 07:28.785
- The older one.
- Mmm, Amy's the Miranda one.

07:28.787 --> 07:30.917
Guys, I'm the Latina one.

07:31.690 --> 07:32.756
- Uh...
- Sort of.

07:32.758 --> 07:34.258
I mean, I guess technically.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.693
What do you mean? I am Latina.

07:36.695 --> 07:37.958
That's a fact.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.831
I mean, you don't even
like spicy food, so...

07:40.833 --> 07:42.900
Yeah, and you're not that
good of a dancer.

07:42.902 --> 07:44.751
Not that all Latinos are good dancers,

07:44.753 --> 07:46.737
but it definitely feels like
you're one level below

07:46.739 --> 07:49.039
- wherever you should be.
- I get it.

07:49.041 --> 07:51.436
This is the first time
you've dated a Latino guy,

07:51.437 --> 07:52.225
and you're out of your element.

07:52.228 --> 07:54.311
I am not out of my element.

07:54.313 --> 07:55.879
I... I am the element.

07:55.881 --> 07:57.781
I'm... the element is in me.

07:57.783 --> 07:59.316
Okay, quick tip.

07:59.318 --> 08:01.151
Just call him "papi" at the
end of every sentence.

08:01.153 --> 08:02.226
You'll drive him wild.

08:02.227 --> 08:03.387
Okay, no, that's not a thing.

08:03.389 --> 08:05.289
- It works.
- It really does.

08:05.291 --> 08:06.890
I've dated a lot of Latin men.

08:07.206 --> 08:08.057
A lot of them.

08:08.577 --> 08:10.661
None of you feel pressured

08:10.663 --> 08:12.729
to buy Jerusha's needlepoint, right?

08:13.085 --> 08:16.333
Actually, it did feel like we
kind of had to buy something.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.222
Had to because of me?

08:18.224 --> 08:20.505
Or had to because
you appreciate quality?

08:20.993 --> 08:21.587
You?

08:22.526 --> 08:24.895
But maybe quality. I don't know.

08:24.897 --> 08:26.745
Come on, you guys should know me by now.

08:26.746 --> 08:28.137
I never pressure you.

08:28.138 --> 08:29.714
So this is not my fault.

08:30.386 --> 08:32.602
I felt pressured to buy
cookies from your foster kids.

08:32.605 --> 08:34.734
And then someone in
Tucson bought a Vespa

08:34.735 --> 08:36.340
with my credit card, and the bank said

08:36.342 --> 08:38.140
I had to prove that I wasn't in Tucson.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.446
How would I even do that?

08:39.447 --> 08:41.678
You take a picture of
yourself with a newspaper

08:41.679 --> 08:42.962
not from Tucson.

08:42.965 --> 08:45.766
You made me take care of the
tropical fish that you raised

08:45.768 --> 08:48.665
even though I can't afford
the tank maintenance.

08:49.421 --> 08:50.765
I had to take out a loan.

08:51.056 --> 08:53.524
My sister was in labor,
and you needed me

08:53.526 --> 08:56.025
to change your screensaver
to flying toasters.

08:56.395 --> 08:58.582
She gave birth in her tub.

08:59.098 --> 09:00.073
Okay, okay.

09:00.712 --> 09:02.429
Okay, I... I am sorry, then.

09:02.586 --> 09:04.303
I'll never pressure you again.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.307
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.674
And it's like, why would
I even want a Vespa?

09:10.676 --> 09:12.543
My vertigo was going crazy at the time.

09:12.545 --> 09:14.344
I had to sit down in the shower.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.982
So I can do hats with squirrels on them.

09:18.984 --> 09:21.761
I can do scarves with birds on them.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.958
What about a scarf
with a squirrel on it?

09:24.431 --> 09:25.063
No.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.359
I mean, I guess technically I could.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.828
But no, I just don't feel
comfortable with that.

09:34.598 --> 09:36.782
¿Qué pasa, amigo? ¿Cómo estás?

09:36.886 --> 09:39.546
- Hey, what's up?
- Ah, answering in Inglés?

09:39.547 --> 09:41.805
I'm gonna have to take away
your Latino card.

09:41.807 --> 09:44.001
I guess you do. I had no
idea you spoke Spanish.

09:44.002 --> 09:45.742
Oh, sí, claro Que sí.

09:45.744 --> 09:48.011
We spoke Spanish in
mi casa all the time.

09:48.013 --> 09:52.353
Uh, lunes, martes, miércoles, and so on.

10:04.012 --> 10:04.655
Mm.

10:05.997 --> 10:07.939
No.

10:11.024 --> 10:13.012
- That is Bud Light.
- Thank you.

10:13.223 --> 10:14.913
But you know what? Who cares?

10:14.914 --> 10:16.840
No, no, man. I don't care.

10:16.842 --> 10:19.009
It's just that I want her
to admit that I'm right.

10:19.011 --> 10:21.478
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, it's about respect.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.414
Right, that sounds like caring.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.488
No, no, no, no, dude. I don't care.

10:27.953 --> 10:29.453
It's just important to me.

10:29.455 --> 10:33.140
Oh, okay, so that's
the definition of caring.

10:33.142 --> 10:35.108
- No, dude, I don't care.
- Right.

10:37.061 --> 10:38.193
Mm!

10:41.333 --> 10:43.634
Hey, feel like getting some lunch?

10:43.636 --> 10:46.571
Oh, no, I'm not really hungry.

10:47.116 --> 10:49.385
People aren't buying anything anymore.

10:49.386 --> 10:50.910
Earlier I was selling a lot,

10:50.911 --> 10:53.546
but now people are returning things.

10:54.608 --> 10:55.847
That... that's weird.

10:57.049 --> 10:58.784
Well, you know retail.

10:59.385 --> 11:00.745
It's a crazy business.

11:01.219 --> 11:02.601
That's probably it.

11:03.238 --> 11:07.357
I just can't help but kind of
feel like a failure as a woman.

11:07.359 --> 11:11.605
You know, my lady parts
are all dried up.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.031
- They're not.
- I can't do needlepoint

11:14.033 --> 11:16.646
up to the standards of these people.

11:16.728 --> 11:18.615
My hair won't hold a perm.

11:19.405 --> 11:21.538
When is it Jerusha's turn?

11:21.540 --> 11:24.141
Oh, come on.

11:24.143 --> 11:27.203
It'll be fine. Sales will pick up.

11:27.204 --> 11:29.863
I mean, people love your scarves.

11:29.865 --> 11:32.505
- What about my hats?
- Oh, and your hats too.

11:32.918 --> 11:35.088
- Even more than your scarves.
- More?

11:35.089 --> 11:36.786
No, the... the same.

11:37.723 --> 11:41.012
Look, it'll get better. I promise.

11:41.013 --> 11:42.566
- Mm-hmm.
- Come here.

11:59.461 --> 12:02.402
Oh, fantástico. Sí, sí.

12:02.403 --> 12:03.068
Really?

12:03.916 --> 12:04.610
Sí.

12:05.013 --> 12:08.368
Wow, this is great.
I'm looking forward to it.

12:08.370 --> 12:10.394
- Oh, sí.
- Awesome.

12:14.647 --> 12:16.567
So you agreed to something, and you have

12:16.769 --> 12:17.895
no idea what it was?

12:17.989 --> 12:22.558
It sounded like "mana sola rar"...

12:22.832 --> 12:24.713
"mana sola ray."

12:25.134 --> 12:26.442
- Bensoso?
- Mañana.

12:26.443 --> 12:27.497
- Mantilla.
- Mango?

12:27.499 --> 12:28.698
Manaquina. Manila?

12:28.700 --> 12:30.032
No, you're not listening.

12:35.623 --> 12:37.006
Okay, stop, stop, stop!

12:37.008 --> 12:37.815
It's not helping.

12:37.817 --> 12:39.050
Don't you speak Spanish?

12:39.151 --> 12:41.340
Um, yeah. Some.

12:41.481 --> 12:43.045
But he was talking so fast.

12:43.047 --> 12:45.280
And plus he's got that Dominican accent,

12:45.281 --> 12:48.968
so he was, like, dropping S's
and, like, moving L's to R's.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.636
And it was a mess.

12:51.082 --> 12:53.666
The only Spanish words I
know are más tequila.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.691
Know what I mean? Ay, ay, ay!

12:55.693 --> 12:57.059
Oh, God.

12:57.061 --> 13:00.146
Oh, hey, Jonah, do you speak Spanish?

13:00.148 --> 13:01.647
- No, why?
- Don't worry about it.

13:01.649 --> 13:03.699
Amy's boyfriend said
something to her in Spanish,

13:03.701 --> 13:05.535
and we're trying to
figure out what he said.

13:05.537 --> 13:07.153
You have a... a boyfriend?

13:07.155 --> 13:09.989
No, just some guy that I've
gone on a couple dates with.

13:10.284 --> 13:11.824
Alex, the beverage guy.

13:11.826 --> 13:14.494
Oh, the beverage guy. Cool.

13:14.812 --> 13:16.810
Cheyenne, look up the Spanish term for,

13:16.811 --> 13:18.548
"Would you like to
have sex in the butt?"

13:18.550 --> 13:19.741
What? Why?

13:19.742 --> 13:21.584
Because that may be what you agreed to.

13:21.943 --> 13:23.693
Oh, busy day, huh?

13:23.695 --> 13:26.528
Yeah, actually, I think I'm
about to sell out.

13:26.529 --> 13:28.447
Whoa, wow.

13:28.449 --> 13:30.366
Well, hey, if you do, no worries,

13:30.368 --> 13:32.201
'cause you got a whole row
of beer right behind you.

13:32.203 --> 13:34.881
Oh, thanks, but you guys
don't sell beer like this.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.539
Oh, no, yeah. Probably not.

13:36.541 --> 13:39.208
Hey, you know what is interesting?

13:39.210 --> 13:41.520
I had a friend try one of your samples,

13:41.521 --> 13:44.890
and... this is crazy...
totally independently,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.959
also said it tastes like Bud Light.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.762
- Well, it's not.
- Well, hey, look.

13:50.305 --> 13:51.761
I wouldn't judge you if it was.

13:51.762 --> 13:53.686
In fact, I'd respect
you for charging $13

13:53.687 --> 13:55.016
for $2 worth of Bud Light.

13:55.017 --> 13:56.559
And I'd appreciate that respect

13:56.561 --> 13:57.727
if that's what I were doing.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.562
- Okay, well...
- Okay, well.

13:59.564 --> 14:01.670
Life is a highway.

14:02.585 --> 14:03.082
What?

14:04.156 --> 14:05.632
I got to get back to work.

14:08.907 --> 14:10.740
So what do you want me to buy from her?

14:10.742 --> 14:13.659
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Just get as much as you can

14:13.661 --> 14:16.329
- for $200, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

14:16.331 --> 14:17.914
- I can do that.
- Thank you.

14:20.418 --> 14:23.419
Excuse me. How much can I buy for $200?

14:23.802 --> 14:26.618
Oh, wow, um, let's find out.

14:26.957 --> 14:29.324
Damn it, random man!

14:29.928 --> 14:32.762
- Okay.
- Hey, you know, I don't think

14:32.764 --> 14:34.764
you want to be spending
all your money here.

14:34.766 --> 14:36.816
- I thought I was supposed to...
- What are you doing?

14:36.818 --> 14:39.268
Well, nothing.
It's just that $200 is a lot

14:39.270 --> 14:41.236
to spend on candy when there's
so many other booths.

14:41.237 --> 14:43.189
Who asked you to get involved?

14:43.191 --> 14:45.191
- Glenn, what's going on?
- He's messing with my sale.

14:45.193 --> 14:46.943
- What do you want me to buy?
- That's what's going on.

14:46.945 --> 14:49.471
It's okay. I... I just want
everybody to be happy.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.697
Then mind your own [bleep] business.

14:52.914 --> 14:54.359
O-okay.

14:57.698 --> 15:00.061
"Lay Na sol ya Ra."

15:01.342 --> 15:02.188
Says it's Hindi.

15:02.189 --> 15:03.564
Could he have been speaking Hindi?

15:03.565 --> 15:04.863
No, he's Dominican.

15:04.864 --> 15:07.463
A Dominican person could
speak Hindi if he wanted to.

15:07.465 --> 15:08.282
He could learn it.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.662
That's great about you

15:09.663 --> 15:11.437
and the beverage guy. I love that guy.

15:11.438 --> 15:13.266
- Really good guy.
- Do you know him?

15:13.267 --> 15:15.009
We've never talked,
but we'll wave, you know?

15:15.010 --> 15:18.474
Or he'll nod if he's, you know,
pushing the dolly or something.

15:18.476 --> 15:20.142
He's a great, great guy.

15:20.144 --> 15:21.343
You said that already.

15:21.525 --> 15:24.446
Why didn't you just tell him that you
didn't understand what he was saying?

15:24.447 --> 15:26.124
Because then he would just go on and on

15:26.125 --> 15:28.484
about taking my Latina card from me.

15:28.486 --> 15:30.069
What's a Latina card?

15:30.071 --> 15:31.988
Like when you go to
Sharky's, you earn points.

15:31.990 --> 15:34.501
We should go on a double date together.

15:34.502 --> 15:37.465
You and, um, the beverage
guy and Kelly and me.

15:37.466 --> 15:39.879
Guys, Amy's in uncharted
territory right now.

15:39.881 --> 15:41.452
She usually only dates white men.

15:41.453 --> 15:43.089
Well, that's pretty racist.

15:43.090 --> 15:47.219
That's not true.
I don't just date white men.

15:47.221 --> 15:50.163
I dated one white guy 15 years ago,

15:50.164 --> 15:51.891
and I just happened to marry him.

15:51.893 --> 15:54.010
I'm gonna call Kelly.
I'm gonna text her.

15:54.012 --> 15:54.696
I'm gonna call her.

15:54.698 --> 15:56.841
Just because she has a preference
doesn't mean she's racist.

15:56.842 --> 15:59.134
I don't have a preference. And if I did,

15:59.135 --> 16:02.184
it probably wouldn't be white guys.

16:02.186 --> 16:04.191
You know what? She's here.
I could just go up and talk to her.

16:04.192 --> 16:05.568
Eh, I'm gonna text her.

16:05.569 --> 16:08.290
I'm sorry, isn't having a preference
the definition of racism?

16:08.291 --> 16:10.322
I think it's racist to
have a non-preference.

16:10.323 --> 16:12.361
Like, you can say,
"I'm into Cuban guys,"

16:12.363 --> 16:15.075
but you can't say, "I'm into
everyone but Cuban guys."

16:15.076 --> 16:16.117
- Ah.
- No, yeah.

16:16.118 --> 16:17.917
I totally kissed a black guy once.

16:17.919 --> 16:18.732
Who?

16:19.787 --> 16:22.596
You don't know him.
It was from high school.

16:22.597 --> 16:23.760
What was his name?

16:24.190 --> 16:25.925
- Peter.
- Peter the black guy?

16:25.927 --> 16:28.441
Yeah, okay, that doesn't
sound right, but whatever.

16:28.442 --> 16:29.310
She's in!

16:30.298 --> 16:31.380
Kelly's in. This is gonna be...

16:31.382 --> 16:32.783
this is gonna be great.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.217
It's gonna be great.
Great, great, great, great.

16:45.657 --> 16:47.490
I don't know, man.

16:47.492 --> 16:50.335
Sometimes I just think that
maybe it was a mistake

16:50.336 --> 16:52.096
to sink my life savings into this.

16:53.464 --> 16:54.533
Yeah, well...

16:54.840 --> 16:55.579
Uh...

16:56.532 --> 16:57.970
- Hang in there.
- Really?

16:58.670 --> 17:00.597
That means a lot, man.

17:01.005 --> 17:02.681
Men need to support other men.

17:02.682 --> 17:04.675
- You know?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

17:04.676 --> 17:07.009
Hey. On the house.

17:07.011 --> 17:10.012
Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't.

17:10.013 --> 17:11.669
It's gonna make me real happy.

17:11.670 --> 17:13.015
- Okay.
- Yeah!

17:13.017 --> 17:14.851
- Thank you.
- Hey, hey, hey,

17:14.853 --> 17:16.018
where you going?

17:16.020 --> 17:16.853
Pop it in.

17:16.855 --> 17:18.488
Oh, you...

17:18.490 --> 17:22.191
you wanted me to, uh, eat it right now?

17:22.193 --> 17:25.896
I want to see the look in your eyes
when that cheese hits your tongue.

17:26.117 --> 17:28.832
Yes, I will... I will do this.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.890
I will put this in there.

17:32.602 --> 17:34.140
That's how it works.

17:37.354 --> 17:39.354
Mmm!

17:39.356 --> 17:40.855
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.024
- That is such a relief.
- Mm-hmm.

17:43.026 --> 17:44.359
I haven't tried it yet.

17:44.361 --> 17:46.661
To be honest, it kind of grosses me out.

17:48.787 --> 17:49.697
Hey, guys.

17:50.009 --> 17:52.486
Um, I just wanted to double check.

17:52.510 --> 17:55.392
No one wanted to buy anything
from Jerusha, right?

17:55.839 --> 17:58.134
Just asking as a pal, not your boss.

17:58.135 --> 18:01.230
Just as a pal who loves crafts.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.678
No, thank you. I don't really like them.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.828
Okay. Cool.

18:07.015 --> 18:07.765
Mateo?

18:08.285 --> 18:10.301
You know, you would look really fetching

18:10.303 --> 18:11.886
in a bird scarf.

18:11.888 --> 18:14.722
Oh, I never cover my neck.
It's my best feature.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.204
Also, I'm saving up for something
I actually want to buy.

18:19.238 --> 18:22.044
- Justine?
- Hard pass.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.901
I think the crossword puzzles
are harder in spring.

18:26.903 --> 18:28.119
Listen up!

18:28.836 --> 18:33.030
Everybody here better get out there
and start buying stuff from my wife!

18:33.491 --> 18:34.967
I feel like you're pressuring us.

18:34.968 --> 18:37.283
You're goddamn right,
I'm pressuring you.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.323
You buy stuff, or you're fired!

18:39.781 --> 18:42.373
- What?
- Yeah, and if you tell anyone

18:42.374 --> 18:43.561
I did this, I'll lie.

18:43.736 --> 18:45.054
And I'll say that I didn't.

18:45.055 --> 18:47.631
And they'll believe me,
because I'm the boss!

18:49.060 --> 18:52.052
Now! Now, go, go!

18:52.053 --> 18:54.392
You move your ass!

18:55.628 --> 18:57.461
I had my medicine in that.

18:57.799 --> 18:59.995
I crush it up and hide it
to trick myself.

18:59.996 --> 19:02.817
Oh, let me... let me help you.

19:02.818 --> 19:04.496
Maybe it's right on top here.

19:04.855 --> 19:08.367
So, I lager for three
months at 35 degrees.

19:08.368 --> 19:10.562
And actually the yeast
that I use is a descendant

19:10.563 --> 19:12.299
of the original Bavarian wild yeasts...

19:12.300 --> 19:15.238
It's Bud Light. It's Bud Light.

19:15.239 --> 19:18.657
It's a descendant of Bud Light
because it's Bud Light.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.206
- What are you doing?
- Just admit it's Bud Light.

19:24.605 --> 19:25.724
Okay, could you...

19:28.585 --> 19:30.236
Fine, it's Bud Light, okay?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.326
I buy the kegs wholesale,
and then I mark up the bottles.

19:32.327 --> 19:34.020
Now, could you please stop
telling everyone?

19:34.021 --> 19:37.173
Thank you for just being honest with me.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.907
That's all I wanted.

19:39.563 --> 19:42.327
Now, how about I take you out sometime?

19:45.524 --> 19:48.099
Hey. I'm taking off.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.336
You're still up for tonight, right?

19:49.337 --> 19:51.550
Uh, yeah.

19:51.551 --> 19:55.377
Tonight, um, so do I need to, like,

19:55.857 --> 20:00.889
wear anything or maybe bring something?

20:00.890 --> 20:02.719
- No, nothing special.
- Okay.

20:02.997 --> 20:03.738
And, um...

20:04.551 --> 20:07.999
and you're sure this is
something I'm gonna enjoy?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.034
I mean, we don't have to
if you don't want to.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.462
Okay, I don't understand
what you're saying!

20:19.464 --> 20:20.880
- Huh?
- My Spanish isn't that good.

20:20.882 --> 20:22.195
My parents never made me
speak it in the house,

20:22.196 --> 20:25.717
and I really don't feel like I should be
made to feel guilty about that, okay?

20:25.718 --> 20:27.910
I was just asking if you're
cool driving for an hour

20:27.911 --> 20:29.555
to this barbecue place I like.

20:29.557 --> 20:31.717
Oh. Oh, cool.

20:32.139 --> 20:34.531
- Yeah, that's, uh, cool.
- Cool.

20:34.532 --> 20:35.238
- Yeah.
- Cool.

20:35.238 --> 20:35.987
Yeah.

20:37.556 --> 20:39.909
So you didn't understand
anything I was saying?

20:39.910 --> 20:42.431
Like all the stuff about
my mom and my family?

20:42.907 --> 20:46.699
Oh, no, no, no.
That... that stuff I totally got.

20:46.700 --> 20:47.759
I understood that.

20:48.237 --> 20:51.438
Your family, they're a riot.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.317
What a... what a hoot.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.587
I can't believe I sold out.

20:57.689 --> 21:01.306
I am so proud of you,
my little saleswoman.

21:01.308 --> 21:04.390
I'm thinking about experimenting
with a badger on a sweater.

21:05.021 --> 21:07.022
I think people would love that.

21:08.305 --> 21:14.757
