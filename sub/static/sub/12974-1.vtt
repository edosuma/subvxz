Come here!

00:29.795 --> 00:31.329
Time to go.

01:29.077 --> 01:31.221
<b>ONE MILLION KLICKS</b>

01:31.222 --> 01:35.839
<b>ONE MILLION KICKS</b>

01:36.071 --> 01:39.671
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

02:25.110 --> 02:28.011
Those karate freaks are inside.
They're causing trouble again.

02:28.012 --> 02:29.247
Kick 'em out for me, would you?

02:29.248 --> 02:30.647
You mean Tim and
his buddy, right?

02:30.648 --> 02:32.148
Exactly.

02:32.149 --> 02:35.821
-Hey, let's go to my place.
-No, dude, she's coming with me.

02:36.221 --> 02:37.754
What do you want with
him, I mean look at

02:37.755 --> 02:39.022
his hair, he looks
like a poodle.

02:39.023 --> 02:40.591
What's wrong with
a man with nice hair?

02:40.592 --> 02:42.993
-I mean, am I right?
-Yeah, right.

02:42.994 --> 02:43.927
Come on, let's drink
something else.

02:43.928 --> 02:45.396
Yeah.

02:46.697 --> 02:48.131
Fuck.

02:48.132 --> 02:50.968
-Guys, time to go home.
-I thought you were off today.

02:50.969 --> 02:53.105
I'm not, not get out!

03:49.261 --> 03:51.661
What, you thinking about
opening your own club?

03:51.662 --> 03:52.629
What?

03:52.630 --> 03:54.331
Yeah, just look around, man.

03:54.332 --> 03:58.269
This is a great cash
printing machine.

04:02.207 --> 04:03.607
Let me ask you a question.

04:03.608 --> 04:04.342
How much work do
you think actually

04:04.343 --> 04:06.944
goes into this place?

04:06.945 --> 04:09.212
It takes a lot of money
to set one of these up.

04:09.213 --> 04:11.815
A lot of cash up front.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.083
And then on opening
night, if you play

04:13.084 --> 04:14.819
the wrong music, you
can kiss it all goodbye.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.387
You get me?

04:17.189 --> 04:19.356
Man, what we need
right now is a single

04:19.357 --> 04:22.926
great idea which set us up, man.

04:22.927 --> 04:24.161
Yeah.

04:24.162 --> 04:25.695
Now get that useless
shit out of your head

04:25.696 --> 04:28.698
and concentrate on the next
big money maker, if you can.

04:28.699 --> 04:31.267
The app that everybody
wants but nobody has.

04:31.268 --> 04:32.738
Exactly.

04:44.348 --> 04:46.116
Hey.

04:46.117 --> 04:47.585
What's up?

04:53.658 --> 04:55.125
Hey.

04:55.126 --> 04:56.394
You're hot, baby.

04:56.395 --> 04:57.863
Gross.

05:01.732 --> 05:03.202
Hey.

05:04.268 --> 05:06.337
You wanna dance?

05:09.006 --> 05:11.741
Well, looks like
you struck out.

05:11.742 --> 05:13.443
Shut it, bro,
and get me a drink.

05:13.444 --> 05:14.912
Fine.

05:15.446 --> 05:16.447
Here you go.

05:16.448 --> 05:17.916
Cheers.

05:24.855 --> 05:25.755
Hey, hey, hey.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.090
Hey.

05:27.091 --> 05:29.025
I was just wondering,
you want a drink?

05:29.026 --> 05:30.193
No, thank you.

05:30.194 --> 05:31.094
Bye.

05:31.095 --> 05:32.296
No?

05:32.297 --> 05:35.765
Hey, just give me
another chance.

05:35.766 --> 05:37.868
Come on.

06:04.829 --> 06:05.962
Well, well, would you look at

06:05.963 --> 06:07.897
the village idiot.

06:07.898 --> 06:10.368
He'll hit on anything.

06:11.203 --> 06:13.338
The little one?

06:13.739 --> 06:14.438
Hey!

06:14.439 --> 06:16.440
That's my girl!

06:26.485 --> 06:28.954
Hey, film this, man.

06:29.521 --> 06:30.988
Film this, man!

06:30.989 --> 06:31.888
Why?

06:31.889 --> 06:32.789
You'll see.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.058
Come on.

06:44.102 --> 06:45.704
Come here!

07:11.929 --> 07:13.597
Time to go.

07:14.232 --> 07:15.132
After him!

07:15.133 --> 07:16.601
Go!

07:17.369 --> 07:18.269
There.

07:18.270 --> 07:19.837
Hey, hold up a second!

07:19.838 --> 07:21.137
Chill out man.

07:21.138 --> 07:22.272
We only want to talk.

07:22.273 --> 07:23.140
That show you put on in there

07:23.141 --> 07:24.274
was amazing, dude.

07:24.275 --> 07:25.875
How you floored those guys?

07:25.876 --> 07:27.546
Unbelievable.

07:28.246 --> 07:29.246
Who are you guys?

07:29.247 --> 07:31.080
What do you want?

07:31.081 --> 07:32.983
I'm Frank Weller

07:32.984 --> 07:35.186
and this is Salva.

07:35.187 --> 07:37.020
We'd like to promote you.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.889
Make you famous.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.960
How you gonna do that?

07:43.494 --> 07:45.361
How about we go
somewhere else and talk?

07:45.362 --> 07:47.931
Go grab a bite to eat?

07:47.932 --> 07:49.334
Coffee would be good.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.234
Super.

07:50.235 --> 07:51.135
Perfect.

07:51.136 --> 07:52.904
Let's go, then.

07:55.073 --> 07:57.907
Well, I guess it's
safe to say you know

07:57.908 --> 08:01.311
how much influence the
internet has, right?

08:01.312 --> 08:04.181
Someone can make
millions with it.

08:04.182 --> 08:07.051
And you can become
a star overnight.

08:07.052 --> 08:09.787
You just got to find something
that doesn't exist.

08:10.588 --> 08:13.390
And you have to be willing
to break new ground.

08:13.391 --> 08:15.392
Are you interested?

08:15.393 --> 08:16.862
Yeah.

08:18.496 --> 08:19.996
What do I have to do?

08:19.997 --> 08:23.467
For right now, you've done everything
already, there in the club.

08:23.468 --> 08:24.870
And we,

08:25.636 --> 08:27.905
well, we made this.

08:35.145 --> 08:38.150
That is unbelievable material.

08:39.015 --> 08:42.421
If you like those happy
slapping videos that went viral.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.990
Teenagers filming each
other beating people up.

08:45.991 --> 08:46.957
But what we have here is

08:46.958 --> 08:49.159
the professional version.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.495
So here's the plan.

08:51.496 --> 08:54.298
We upload the video
on our website.

08:54.299 --> 08:56.366
We link it everywhere,

08:56.367 --> 08:59.202
and send it over the world.

08:59.203 --> 09:00.904
It's gonna get a
ton of views because

09:00.905 --> 09:02.606
it's killer.

09:02.607 --> 09:05.375
This is gonna go viral, man.

09:05.376 --> 09:08.179
And when it spreads,
like we expect it to,

09:08.947 --> 09:11.247
and the people watch it,

09:11.248 --> 09:14.183
man, we don't even need
to take money from them.

09:14.184 --> 09:17.654
When the number of clicks on
our home page will go sky high,

09:17.655 --> 09:19.222
now we will be
automatically interesting

09:19.223 --> 09:22.125
for some businessman
to come along.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.862
That's when the real
cash comes in, right?

09:25.195 --> 09:26.362
That's right.

09:26.363 --> 09:29.232
But we'll make money from
the page visitors as well.

09:29.233 --> 09:33.636
And you, Mike, the people
will love you, man.

09:33.637 --> 09:35.505
Just think about
it for a second.

09:35.506 --> 09:36.941
Anyone who's ever
been kicked out of

09:36.942 --> 09:38.274
a night club or had
a run-in with some

09:38.275 --> 09:40.678
asshole bouncer will want to see

09:40.679 --> 09:44.915
how you mop the floor
with these meatheads.

09:45.617 --> 09:47.717
They're gonna want to
know more about you,

09:47.718 --> 09:49.653
see more of you.

09:49.654 --> 09:51.122
Yeah?

09:51.957 --> 09:53.225
And then,

09:54.125 --> 09:56.495
we'll give them more.

09:58.262 --> 10:00.265
What do you think?

10:03.334 --> 10:04.803
Sorry.

10:05.569 --> 10:07.805
Excuse me a second.

10:08.606 --> 10:09.673
When do you get off, Katya?

10:09.674 --> 10:11.107
Yeah, I'm about ready.

10:11.108 --> 10:13.877
Drink this up and
then we can go.

10:17.982 --> 10:19.449
Baby.

10:19.450 --> 10:22.119
You think it's a good idea?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.355
I think it's an idea
that we can make work.

10:24.356 --> 10:25.621
Morally speaking?

10:25.622 --> 10:27.092
Morally?

10:27.692 --> 10:30.727
Come on, we're talking
about the internet.

10:30.728 --> 10:34.097
Illegal downloads,
computer viruses,

10:34.098 --> 10:36.200
pornography, hello?

10:37.334 --> 10:40.037
Man, there are no morals.

10:40.671 --> 10:42.338
So yeah, I think
the idea is good.

10:42.339 --> 10:44.140
Can I get you anything?

10:44.141 --> 10:45.409
Yeah.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.211
Your number.

10:49.713 --> 10:52.317
Just forget about
it, little man.

10:53.251 --> 10:54.650
Go back to bed.

10:54.651 --> 10:56.688
Hey, come on.

10:57.322 --> 11:00.859
I want to do this
with you, okay?

11:02.059 --> 11:03.327
Fine.

11:04.029 --> 11:05.297
Okay.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.198
That is if Mike
even wants to do it.

11:08.199 --> 11:10.934
Of course he will,
just look at the guy.

11:13.771 --> 11:15.240
Hey.

11:18.575 --> 11:20.309
And?

11:20.310 --> 11:21.779
And?

11:22.447 --> 11:24.648
Well guys, thank
you for the coffee,

11:24.649 --> 11:27.185
but I'm not interested.

11:30.354 --> 11:32.389
I made a mistake.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.058
I don't know.

11:35.293 --> 11:36.393
Hey, hey.

11:36.394 --> 11:38.129
Wait a minute.

11:39.697 --> 11:41.130
Here.

11:41.131 --> 11:44.336
If you change your
mind, buzz me.

11:51.508 --> 11:52.977
Shit.

11:53.811 --> 11:55.279
Well.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.616
Guess we're not doing it.

12:05.155 --> 12:08.092
Pretty cold tonight, right?

12:08.492 --> 12:09.961
Relax.

12:13.832 --> 12:15.300
You?

12:16.434 --> 12:18.534
We better talk.

12:18.535 --> 12:20.137
Talk?

12:20.604 --> 12:23.307
You want to talk to me?

12:23.308 --> 12:27.044
There is always a
first time, right?

12:29.646 --> 12:31.548
Michael, it's important.

12:31.549 --> 12:34.019
I must speak with you.

12:34.785 --> 12:37.587
Yeah, but I don't, old man.

12:37.588 --> 12:38.588
When Mom got sick,
you got off at

12:38.589 --> 12:40.256
the first stop and made off.

12:40.257 --> 12:41.858
You left us in that shithole.

12:41.859 --> 12:44.361
We lived in hell for 10 years.

12:44.362 --> 12:45.596
And now you show up at my house

12:45.597 --> 12:48.332
and you want to talk to me?

12:48.333 --> 12:49.765
If I recall, you
used to just let

12:49.766 --> 12:52.670
your fists speak for you.

12:52.837 --> 12:54.471
I know you're angry with me.

12:54.472 --> 12:56.775
You have no idea.

12:57.876 --> 13:00.077
Michael, please.

13:02.679 --> 13:04.481
Don't ever come here again.

13:04.482 --> 13:06.284
Leave me alone.

14:04.442 --> 14:05.910
I'm in.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.746
On one condition.

14:09.314 --> 14:11.715
Give me a challenge.

14:11.716 --> 14:13.516
Give me guys who can fight back,

14:13.517 --> 14:15.252
good fighters.

17:24.907 --> 17:26.443
Mikey, hey there.

17:26.444 --> 17:27.144
Hey.

17:27.145 --> 17:28.010
Sit down.

17:28.011 --> 17:29.145
Nah, please sit.

17:29.146 --> 17:30.180
Good to see you.

17:30.181 --> 17:31.181
Hey.

17:31.182 --> 17:34.319
Our video's a real hit, man.

17:35.086 --> 17:36.553
Good.

17:37.488 --> 17:39.090
Mark Jahnke.

17:44.962 --> 17:45.895
Yo.

17:45.896 --> 17:47.398
Yeah.

17:48.165 --> 17:50.834
Stuntman, martial arts fighter,

17:50.835 --> 17:52.935
adrenaline junkie.

17:52.936 --> 17:55.605
Here, parachuting,
bungee jumping,

17:55.606 --> 17:58.208
parkour, he does it all.

17:58.675 --> 17:59.910
Some more on him.

17:59.911 --> 18:01.811
Quick cars, quicker motorcycles

18:01.812 --> 18:03.280
and women.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.116
And he is extreme

18:07.117 --> 18:09.486
in his jealousy.

18:49.594 --> 18:50.961
Man, Mark, you
know how I hate it

18:50.962 --> 18:52.194
when you pick me
up here with this

18:52.195 --> 18:54.297
shitty crap bike.

19:12.817 --> 19:13.950
I reserved it.

19:13.951 --> 19:15.652
I just want to
collect it, all right?

19:15.653 --> 19:17.020
You gotta do it now?

19:17.021 --> 19:18.587
Yeah, if you'd like
to do something else

19:18.588 --> 19:19.955
with me, other than
stick me on the back

19:19.956 --> 19:21.425
of a bike.

19:21.858 --> 19:23.326
Okay.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.270
Nice machine.

19:33.271 --> 19:35.073
Thank you.

19:38.909 --> 19:41.645
I'm talking to her, bro.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.851
You could treat me real nice.

19:51.222 --> 19:54.792
Watch your stinkin'
mouth, asshole.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.130
Say something else.

20:00.865 --> 20:02.332
Hey.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.202
Stinky asshole.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.237
Hello?

20:09.706 --> 20:10.639
Maybe you should
get out and just

20:10.640 --> 20:13.110
say you're sorry?

20:14.177 --> 20:15.645
Whoops.

20:15.646 --> 20:18.515
You're gonna pay for that.

20:25.655 --> 20:26.856
Hey, man.

20:26.857 --> 20:28.924
We going too far?

20:28.925 --> 20:32.162
We're taking this
in a new direction.

20:32.163 --> 20:33.963
Hey!

20:33.964 --> 20:35.164
You think there's a
chance my buddy here

20:35.165 --> 20:38.768
can take your
girlfriend for a ride?

20:40.203 --> 20:41.671
Mark!

20:46.676 --> 20:48.145
It's on.

20:49.312 --> 20:51.815
Guess I deserved that.

20:51.816 --> 20:54.418
Get out, it's on, man!

21:10.934 --> 21:12.570
Yeah, pow!

22:11.127 --> 22:12.695
Hey, baby.

22:12.696 --> 22:16.833
How about a little kiss
for the winner?

22:19.803 --> 22:21.171
What are you doing
with daddy's laptop?

22:21.172 --> 22:23.307
It's not for you.

22:23.874 --> 22:25.107
Cool.

22:25.108 --> 22:27.710
Check this out,
it's really cool.

22:29.245 --> 22:32.582
I've got to send
this to the guys.

22:36.986 --> 22:38.921
That was a great move.

22:41.291 --> 22:42.325
I gotta forward that.

22:42.326 --> 22:44.462
Gotta forward it.

22:45.328 --> 22:46.962
Hey, what are you watching?

22:46.963 --> 22:48.097
Sweet?

22:48.098 --> 22:49.667
Sexy.

23:08.319 --> 23:09.786
Go!

23:10.421 --> 23:11.887
All right, strong kicks now.

23:11.888 --> 23:13.356
Come on!

23:27.238 --> 23:29.307
Okay, two kicks.

23:37.248 --> 23:39.382
Okay, could you take
over for a moment?

23:39.383 --> 23:40.918
Continue.

23:42.886 --> 23:43.787
Hey.

23:43.788 --> 23:44.520
Can I help?

23:44.521 --> 23:45.855
Yeah.

23:45.856 --> 23:48.258
We came here to check it out.

23:48.259 --> 23:49.959
All three of you guys?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.428
No, him.

23:52.195 --> 23:53.863
All right, go
change your clothes,

23:53.864 --> 23:56.432
come on up and we
can all have a look.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.034
All right?

23:58.501 --> 23:59.969
See you.

24:02.473 --> 24:03.807
All right!

24:03.808 --> 24:05.075
Ready!

24:06.543 --> 24:08.011
Go!

24:22.259 --> 24:23.459
Be careful, man!

24:23.460 --> 24:24.928
Woo!

24:26.262 --> 24:28.431
Sorry about that,
my hand slipped.

24:28.432 --> 24:29.833
Did it?

24:29.834 --> 24:31.099
Okay.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.569
Again.

24:38.975 --> 24:41.511
Sorry, my foot slipped.

25:17.213 --> 25:18.481
I'm sorry, class.

25:18.482 --> 25:20.983
The training is
over, unfortunately.

25:20.984 --> 25:23.053
'til the next class.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.122
Phong.

25:26.123 --> 25:27.591
Go on.

26:24.982 --> 26:26.784
Mike, you good?

26:27.717 --> 26:30.153
This guy's perfect.

26:50.573 --> 26:52.642
Come on, get up.

27:04.588 --> 27:05.488
It's the end.

27:05.489 --> 27:06.957
Yeah.

27:14.464 --> 27:15.932
Yes!

27:17.166 --> 27:20.938
It's going to be
a night to remember.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.182
Hey!

27:33.183 --> 27:34.083
Hey there.

27:34.084 --> 27:35.283
You have to see this.

27:35.284 --> 27:36.519
This is classic.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.120
You haven't seen
anything like this.

27:38.121 --> 27:39.055
You see that?

27:39.056 --> 27:39.756
That guy there?

27:39.757 --> 27:41.257
Watch him up and then

27:41.258 --> 27:43.125
right from below.

27:43.126 --> 27:44.928
And again wham!

27:45.396 --> 27:47.831
This guy's perfect.

27:55.105 --> 27:56.573
Yeah!

28:05.415 --> 28:06.516
Hey!

28:06.517 --> 28:08.218
Check it out!

28:21.298 --> 28:24.099
Are you the guy
from the internet?

28:24.100 --> 28:25.134
Cool.

28:25.135 --> 28:27.137
This is classic.

29:00.369 --> 29:01.838
Woo hoo!

29:02.606 --> 29:04.073
Yeah.

29:18.655 --> 29:19.622
Hey, don't overdo it,

29:19.623 --> 29:21.957
you got a fight tomorrow.

29:23.359 --> 29:25.260
Makes no difference.

29:25.261 --> 29:27.264
I'll kick his ass.

29:39.242 --> 29:41.977
Who's playing, by the way?

29:42.378 --> 29:43.812
I don't know, man.

29:43.813 --> 29:46.781
They guys in the
white shirts won 1-0.

29:46.782 --> 29:48.917
Now where's that stupid idiot?

29:48.918 --> 29:50.853
There he is.

29:51.722 --> 29:52.687
Mikey.

29:52.688 --> 29:53.588
Hey.

29:53.589 --> 29:55.926
Here, put this on.

30:08.938 --> 30:12.075
What's this guy doing here?

30:23.486 --> 30:24.954
Amazing.

30:53.649 --> 30:54.884
This will be the greatest video

30:54.885 --> 30:57.020
we've ever taken.

30:57.687 --> 30:59.355
Definitely.

31:02.392 --> 31:03.861
Hey!

31:05.729 --> 31:07.297
Shit.

31:07.830 --> 31:09.965
Two right, two left.

31:09.966 --> 31:12.068
Fuck, get down!

31:12.636 --> 31:14.103
Cops!

31:15.472 --> 31:18.475
We're not finished with you!

31:24.013 --> 31:25.780
Shit, what now?

31:25.781 --> 31:27.316
Just drive.

31:27.317 --> 31:29.919
Well, what about Mike?

31:35.325 --> 31:38.796
Just forget about
him and drive!

31:45.335 --> 31:48.637
I find you to be quite tough.

31:48.638 --> 31:50.841
You're impressive.

31:58.382 --> 32:00.816
Michael Schneider.

32:00.817 --> 32:02.350
We have three entries.

32:02.351 --> 32:04.020
Twice for property damage,

32:04.021 --> 32:07.722
once for an accusation
of criminal assault.

32:07.723 --> 32:09.192
That's it.

32:10.460 --> 32:11.559
I'm guessing this
had nothing to do

32:11.560 --> 32:13.596
with the football?

32:13.597 --> 32:15.064
So what?

32:15.665 --> 32:16.932
Next door sit
three of your rivals

32:16.933 --> 32:18.433
and I can now tell you
everything about them

32:18.434 --> 32:19.902
down to the smallest
detail on up to

32:19.903 --> 32:22.472
their favorite players.

32:23.639 --> 32:25.508
And I ask myself

32:25.975 --> 32:28.978
how you fit in this puzzle.

32:33.383 --> 32:34.783
The police had taken
the fans of the visiting

32:34.784 --> 32:37.052
team out of a separate
exit in the stadium.

32:37.053 --> 32:39.488
Do you see my problem with that?

32:39.489 --> 32:41.589
If you'd been to see
it then you wouldn't

32:41.590 --> 32:42.590
have been on that
side of the stadium,

32:42.591 --> 32:44.361
would you?

32:51.867 --> 32:53.836
Well, then I guess
I should keep quiet

32:53.837 --> 32:55.671
without my lawyer.

32:55.672 --> 32:59.076
I don't think
that's necessary.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.943
Your three opponents
won't file against you.

33:01.944 --> 33:03.378
I guess they assume
that you also

33:03.379 --> 33:05.114
won't make a report.

33:05.115 --> 33:07.817
Hooligans stick together, right?

33:07.818 --> 33:09.553
Sport is fair.

33:12.021 --> 33:15.825
But there is still the
assault on the policeman.

33:15.826 --> 33:18.328
That was an accident.

33:18.994 --> 33:20.562
Was it?

33:20.563 --> 33:22.431
Naturally.

33:22.432 --> 33:23.965
If I had attacked you,

33:23.966 --> 33:26.669
you'd have known about it.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.006
Yeah.

33:31.007 --> 33:32.542
You're right.

33:33.409 --> 33:34.076
You couldn't have
actually hit me,

33:34.077 --> 33:35.043
isn't that right?

33:35.044 --> 33:36.145
Too slow?

33:36.146 --> 33:37.113
Too angry.

33:37.114 --> 33:38.582
Too weak.

33:39.081 --> 33:40.750
I was overtired.

33:40.751 --> 33:41.783
Then you should go
back to your house

33:41.784 --> 33:43.653
and have a rest.

33:44.721 --> 33:46.990
No charges, then?

33:47.590 --> 33:49.625
Why should I?

33:49.626 --> 33:50.725
Since I'm the only
one who actually

33:50.726 --> 33:52.361
landed a hit.

33:53.730 --> 33:56.097
Put some ice on it.

33:56.098 --> 34:01.002
Officer, are you trying
to tell me something?

34:01.003 --> 34:02.437
1-0.

34:02.438 --> 34:03.905
What?

34:03.906 --> 34:06.243
Your team won 1-0.

34:30.801 --> 34:31.833
Hey!

34:31.833 --> 34:33.969
There's our star.

34:35.504 --> 34:37.773
The video's already
online and people love it.

34:37.774 --> 34:39.909
That's great.

34:39.909 --> 34:40.809
It is great.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.510
We should celebrate!

34:42.511 --> 34:44.079
Besides, we have
to celebrate that

34:44.080 --> 34:45.547
you're a free man again.

34:45.547 --> 34:47.049
Come on, get in!

34:47.050 --> 34:48.650
I'll walk.

34:55.690 --> 34:57.826
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

34:57.827 --> 34:59.661
What's up, man?

34:59.662 --> 35:01.030
What's wrong?

35:01.031 --> 35:02.864
I want a go at
that police officer.

35:02.865 --> 35:04.166
What?

35:04.167 --> 35:06.168
The police guy who stopped us.

35:06.169 --> 35:07.770
He's fucked.

35:07.771 --> 35:09.238
Yeah.

35:10.173 --> 35:11.172
Hell no.

35:11.173 --> 35:12.641
Got it?

35:13.109 --> 35:14.809
Mike, he's a copy.

35:14.810 --> 35:15.811
We should feel lucky
that he let you

35:15.812 --> 35:17.512
go like that.

35:17.513 --> 35:18.514
Hey, aside from
that, it's not all

35:18.515 --> 35:19.715
about you, okay?

35:19.716 --> 35:21.250
There's also me
and Salva and what

35:21.251 --> 35:23.184
we have built
together, our team.

35:23.185 --> 35:24.587
And I won't put all
this on the line

35:24.588 --> 35:28.457
just because you got
your little ego hurt.

35:30.993 --> 35:32.561
Hey, Mike.

35:32.562 --> 35:34.096
Drop it.

35:34.097 --> 35:35.564
Okay.

36:12.801 --> 36:14.003
Too slow?

36:14.004 --> 36:15.472
Too angry.

36:16.839 --> 36:18.307
Too weak.

36:58.048 --> 36:59.248
Mikey!

36:59.249 --> 37:00.748
Mikey.

37:00.749 --> 37:02.218
Sit down.

37:09.859 --> 37:11.293
The Chinese place
around the corner

37:11.294 --> 37:12.895
would have been fine.

37:12.896 --> 37:14.329
Yeah?

37:14.330 --> 37:16.898
But have you ever been in
this restaurant before?

37:16.899 --> 37:17.866
Nah.

37:17.867 --> 37:18.766
This place is good, right?

37:18.767 --> 37:20.302
Yeah.

37:21.037 --> 37:23.304
And have you
ever heard the name

37:23.305 --> 37:25.574
Lee Aang Song?

37:27.743 --> 37:29.677
The Kung Fu fighter?

37:29.678 --> 37:31.012
Was it Kung Fu?

37:31.013 --> 37:32.146
I guess it was Kung Fu.

37:32.147 --> 37:33.815
Kung Fu, yeah.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.284
Hey, that's also Chinese, right?

37:35.285 --> 37:36.751
Yeah, it is.

37:36.752 --> 37:38.253
That's cool.

37:38.254 --> 37:39.723
Hey.

37:40.222 --> 37:42.291
What's this about Song?

37:42.292 --> 37:44.994
Well, yeah, what have
you heard about him?

37:44.995 --> 37:47.564
A gifted Kung Fu guy.

37:48.330 --> 37:50.766
All I know about him is

37:50.767 --> 37:53.668
that he left the
ring a long time ago.

37:53.669 --> 37:54.902
Can you shred him?

37:54.903 --> 37:56.905
Yeah, I can shred anyone.

37:57.774 --> 37:59.375
That's good.

37:59.376 --> 38:01.976
You want to know what
I heard about him?

38:01.977 --> 38:04.847
He is also a very good cook.

38:05.247 --> 38:07.382
And as I see it,

38:07.383 --> 38:09.150
he really should
take a bit more care

38:09.151 --> 38:11.887
with his customer's meals.

38:26.102 --> 38:27.637
Is he here?

38:29.339 --> 38:30.807
Really?

38:37.113 --> 38:38.146
Hey, cookie.

38:38.147 --> 38:40.617
Where's the kitchen?

38:51.294 --> 38:54.029
I have a big fucking
maggot in my meal.

38:54.030 --> 38:55.831
What are you doing here?

38:55.832 --> 38:57.231
No, no, no, don't throw it!

38:57.232 --> 38:58.701
Don't throw it, please.

38:58.702 --> 39:01.302
What kind of
shitty place is this?

39:01.303 --> 39:02.271
Don't touch that, please.

39:02.272 --> 39:03.740
Please go.

39:25.294 --> 39:26.829
Sorry.

39:26.830 --> 39:29.265
I'll bring a new one.

39:30.934 --> 39:32.967
Forget it, creampie.

39:32.968 --> 39:34.302
You should have
stuck with what it is

39:34.303 --> 39:35.905
you do best.

39:36.372 --> 39:37.841
Song.

39:40.477 --> 39:42.712
What do you want?

39:43.345 --> 39:46.081
I want to have a
little chat with you.

39:46.082 --> 39:47.817
Learn cooking.

39:48.218 --> 39:51.454
Then please leave here.

39:58.327 --> 39:59.293
I think you're gonna have to

39:59.294 --> 40:01.630
kick me out of here.

40:09.104 --> 40:11.440
Aha, I understand.

40:21.517 --> 40:22.518
And fellas, please don't look

40:22.519 --> 40:24.854
in the camera, okay?

40:30.926 --> 40:32.394
Sorry.

40:34.798 --> 40:36.533
Enough talk.

41:11.167 --> 41:13.568
We can quit
fighting at any time.

41:13.569 --> 41:15.637
We lose nothing.

41:16.039 --> 41:19.376
We don't win anything, either.

41:23.446 --> 41:26.515
We gain greatness instead.

41:30.385 --> 41:34.155
I don't care about
any of that shit.

41:34.156 --> 41:35.892
I want to win.

41:54.943 --> 41:55.643
Look!

41:55.644 --> 41:57.112
My spoon!

42:20.403 --> 42:22.371
You had your fight.

42:22.372 --> 42:23.840
Go on.

42:24.973 --> 42:26.443
Please.

42:29.646 --> 42:31.981
Get your fists up.

42:40.689 --> 42:43.025
I'm done fighting.

42:46.461 --> 42:47.663
Knock him out, Mike.

42:47.664 --> 42:49.599
We'll cut this.

42:52.001 --> 42:53.534
You're a good fighter.

42:53.535 --> 42:55.871
You don't need this.

43:03.345 --> 43:05.214
Punch him out!

43:12.021 --> 43:13.490
And, cut!

43:15.992 --> 43:18.460
Mikey, that was amazing.

43:18.461 --> 43:20.930
Right, we'd better go.

43:33.575 --> 43:35.043
Stellar.

43:36.713 --> 43:40.148
This video is good,
guys, really good.

43:44.486 --> 43:46.088
Really cool.

44:10.479 --> 44:13.282
Don't think about it, okay?

44:32.635 --> 44:34.235
What do you want?

44:34.236 --> 44:35.704
To talk.

44:36.305 --> 44:38.407
We did that already.

44:38.408 --> 44:40.143
Out of my way.

44:42.611 --> 44:44.346
Hey.

44:44.347 --> 44:45.547
I saw your fighting videos.

44:45.548 --> 44:47.315
You've learned a lot.

44:47.316 --> 44:49.251
Yeah, so what?

44:49.252 --> 44:51.988
Do you want to go a round?

44:52.754 --> 44:55.291
I'm not here to fight.

44:55.825 --> 44:58.727
Well, why did you come?

44:59.127 --> 45:00.262
I just want to talk, kid.

45:00.263 --> 45:01.762
Don't call me kid.

45:01.763 --> 45:03.999
The kid's not here.

45:05.368 --> 45:06.768
Yeah, but the
man you became is

45:06.769 --> 45:08.704
because of me.

45:10.673 --> 45:11.773
I get nothing from you.

45:11.774 --> 45:13.242
Nothing!

45:16.678 --> 45:17.679
Yeah.

45:17.680 --> 45:20.282
You have your mother's eyes.

45:20.283 --> 45:23.186
But the fire in them is mine.

45:27.722 --> 45:29.824
The next time you come here,

45:29.825 --> 45:32.294
then come for a fight.

45:33.129 --> 45:36.297
A father's role
doesn't suit you.

45:36.298 --> 45:37.431
I don't want you
to hurt too many

45:37.432 --> 45:39.701
people on your way,

45:40.303 --> 45:42.137
and have to ask
them for forgiveness

45:42.138 --> 45:44.407
so you can find peace.

45:45.807 --> 45:47.375
Maybe you don't
have as much time

45:47.376 --> 45:49.044
as you think.

45:55.651 --> 45:58.153
How long do you have?

45:59.655 --> 46:02.257
Maybe a few weeks.

46:02.258 --> 46:04.060
I have no idea.

46:05.461 --> 46:06.928
What?

46:07.229 --> 46:08.496
Cancer.

46:11.767 --> 46:13.769
Your chances?

46:14.236 --> 46:17.340
Hey, gone in the first round.

46:22.678 --> 46:24.147
Michael.

46:25.481 --> 46:27.882
Respect the ones who are worthy

46:27.883 --> 46:31.920
to be loved and
cherished in your life.

46:31.921 --> 46:33.855
Don't spend your
days rotting away

46:33.856 --> 46:35.824
and hanging out with me in hell

46:35.825 --> 46:38.227
burning for eternity.

47:18.633 --> 47:20.268
Keep your feet down, bro.

47:20.269 --> 47:22.405
No damn karate shit.

47:28.577 --> 47:30.212
Damn it, Ritter.

47:30.213 --> 47:30.978
Hey.

47:30.979 --> 47:32.413
If you like this kind of thing,

47:32.414 --> 47:33.847
I have a really cool
website for you.

47:33.848 --> 47:36.251
One million klicks dot com.

47:36.252 --> 47:37.719
Man, you gotta see it.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.856
This guy's crazy.

47:40.522 --> 47:41.556
In his last video,
he took on a group

47:41.557 --> 47:42.791
of hooligans.

47:42.792 --> 47:44.260
What?

47:45.260 --> 47:47.262
How's that?

47:49.564 --> 47:52.168
Did you say hooligans?

48:00.943 --> 48:03.512
How's that?

48:09.618 --> 48:11.220
Did I win?

48:29.772 --> 48:31.841
It's that guy.

48:32.941 --> 48:37.012
The video already had
300 people click on it.

48:37.013 --> 48:38.346
I wish your main
actor would share

48:38.347 --> 48:39.880
your enthusiasm.

48:39.881 --> 48:42.784
He will get over it soon.

48:42.785 --> 48:44.385
I hope so.

48:44.386 --> 48:45.753
I have a lot of
emails from people

48:45.754 --> 48:49.623
who want autographs
and fan shirts.

48:49.624 --> 48:51.025
And dates.

48:51.026 --> 48:53.329
He's a lucky guy.

48:57.700 --> 48:59.967
Here, perhaps this will
cheer him up again.

48:59.968 --> 49:01.970
A date with twins?

49:02.338 --> 49:03.538
Nah, better.

49:03.539 --> 49:06.641
A date with Andrej Piotrowski.

49:06.642 --> 49:08.509
This guy's the Russian
Ultimate Fighting

49:08.510 --> 49:11.379
champion and he'll, I quote,

49:13.649 --> 49:15.050
teach this arrogant
fighting dwarf

49:15.051 --> 49:17.186
a lesson and then

49:17.886 --> 49:21.755
supply his dentist
with a lot of work.

49:21.756 --> 49:23.425
Do you think it's serious?

49:23.426 --> 49:25.393
I guess so.

49:25.394 --> 49:26.795
Here.

49:26.796 --> 49:28.929
We get to choose the
location and time.

49:28.930 --> 49:30.965
He hopes that we can be quick

49:30.966 --> 49:35.804
and the floor on which
Mike will fall is hard.

49:35.805 --> 49:38.072
Do you know what this is?

49:38.073 --> 49:40.409
We're in the big time, man.

49:40.743 --> 49:41.976
Yeah.

49:41.977 --> 49:42.943
Hey, it's a fight
we don't have to start

49:42.944 --> 49:45.413
against a famous challenger.

49:45.414 --> 49:47.414
We can market this
fight real good, man.

49:47.415 --> 49:49.050
Online promotion campaign.

49:49.051 --> 49:50.951
And when Mike floors this baby,

49:50.952 --> 49:53.721
other fighters will just
want to get in line.

49:53.722 --> 49:55.556
If Mike floors him, you mean.

49:56.425 --> 49:57.391
Hey, he'll mop the
floor with him.

49:57.392 --> 49:58.626
Move, I have to tell him.

50:45.941 --> 50:49.010
You have a problem, dwarf?

50:49.879 --> 50:53.282
Not if the next
round is yours.

53:33.776 --> 53:36.711
Hey, Mike, can you hear me?

53:37.646 --> 53:40.914
What was all that
shit about, man?

53:40.915 --> 53:42.282
Yeah, perhaps I wasn't
clear when I said

53:42.283 --> 53:43.918
no fights without a camera.

53:43.919 --> 53:47.389
Come on, man,
he can't hear you.

53:48.656 --> 53:50.793
I saw your videos.

53:52.060 --> 53:53.662
Pretty good.

53:56.064 --> 53:59.666
And I talked to Lee
Aang Song for a bit.

53:59.667 --> 54:03.137
He wasn't interested
in prosecuting you.

54:03.138 --> 54:04.607
He said,

54:05.908 --> 54:09.210
the fight was between
two consummating adults.

54:09.211 --> 54:11.679
Can you believe it?

54:11.680 --> 54:15.083
He wanted to redo
the kitchen anyway.

54:15.084 --> 54:17.253
A respectable man.

54:18.220 --> 54:20.355
If you ask me,
he's a bit too old

54:20.356 --> 54:22.925
to put up a good fight.

54:28.897 --> 54:29.998
By the way, we
arrested the guy who

54:29.999 --> 54:31.700
attacked you.

54:34.002 --> 54:35.335
And

54:35.336 --> 54:37.871
it looks like that
you'll once again

54:37.872 --> 54:41.276
get off scot-free,
now won't you?

54:47.115 --> 54:49.217
Almost, at least.

54:54.756 --> 54:57.492
I guess his marks the end
of a promising career.

55:00.763 --> 55:02.130
What happened?

55:02.131 --> 55:03.197
We talked a
little bit and then

55:03.198 --> 55:04.197
he started to shout.

55:04.198 --> 55:05.800
How'd that happen?

55:05.801 --> 55:07.268
Guess you'd better ask him.

55:07.269 --> 55:09.971
You'd better leave now.

55:09.972 --> 55:11.439
Go on.

55:16.178 --> 55:17.378
Try and relax.

55:17.379 --> 55:19.747
Take shallow breaths.

55:20.448 --> 55:22.751
You're a lucky guy.

55:23.752 --> 55:25.253
Yeah, real lucky.

55:25.254 --> 55:26.688
Honestly, after
everything that

55:26.689 --> 55:29.023
I've seen and heard about you,

55:29.024 --> 55:30.291
you should feel
lucky that nothing

55:30.292 --> 55:32.761
worse happened to you.

55:36.464 --> 55:39.400
Do you need anything else?

55:40.234 --> 55:42.371
Only some rest.

56:05.227 --> 56:06.226
And?

56:06.227 --> 56:09.297
How are you feeling today, then?

56:09.298 --> 56:10.498
Well, I feel like
a man who's had

56:10.499 --> 56:12.968
a messing knife stuck
between his ribs.

56:15.370 --> 56:17.003
You think I'm joking?

56:17.004 --> 56:18.806
You beat innocent
people up on the street

56:18.807 --> 56:22.809
and you're surprised
when someone fights back?

56:22.810 --> 56:26.079
I fight against
men who can fight.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.215
And there are some
rules, you know.

56:28.216 --> 56:29.217
Yeah.

56:29.218 --> 56:32.321
But not everyone follows them.

56:32.854 --> 56:35.056
You don't get it.

56:35.057 --> 56:38.927
No, because it's
senseless and stupid.

56:40.863 --> 56:42.096
Well, if you'd
like, perhaps we could

56:42.097 --> 56:45.833
talk more about it
over dinner some time.

56:45.834 --> 56:48.503
That's nothing something
I want to discuss.

56:48.504 --> 56:49.503
Then we'll eat
something and talk

56:49.504 --> 56:51.740
about other things.

56:53.809 --> 56:55.477
Eat silently?

57:07.455 --> 57:10.525
Surprised to see me, yeah?

57:10.926 --> 57:12.461
Yeah.

57:14.863 --> 57:17.431
Fight didn't go well?

57:17.432 --> 57:19.132
And not real fair.

57:19.133 --> 57:20.333
Never fair.

57:20.334 --> 57:23.738
That's why I don't
fight anymore.

57:26.140 --> 57:28.443
You feel all right?

57:30.578 --> 57:33.346
A little better, yeah.

57:33.347 --> 57:36.084
How do you feel in here?

57:37.586 --> 57:39.420
What do you mean?

57:39.421 --> 57:43.124
Have you learned anything?

57:43.559 --> 57:44.992
Okay.

57:44.993 --> 57:49.530
Here, I brought you a
little something to eat.

57:49.531 --> 57:51.700
Poisoned?

57:53.267 --> 57:57.072
Not worse than
hospital food, anyway.

58:21.530 --> 58:22.997
Thanks.

58:30.071 --> 58:31.840
You come again?

58:34.609 --> 58:37.077
Why do you come here every day?

58:37.078 --> 58:38.579
And why bring food with you?

58:38.580 --> 58:40.047
Mike,

58:40.048 --> 58:43.519
you are a good
fighter, but angry.

58:44.519 --> 58:48.856
You're hanging around
with the wrong people.

58:49.323 --> 58:52.092
You should listen to yourself.

58:52.093 --> 58:55.228
Get something to fill your day.

58:55.229 --> 58:56.096
Here.

58:56.097 --> 58:57.632
Still warm.

58:59.901 --> 59:02.570
I'll come in the morning.

59:02.970 --> 59:05.672
With lunch and a lesson.

59:05.673 --> 59:07.808
I don't need your
shitty lessons.

59:08.644 --> 59:10.611
Tomorrow, then.

59:25.394 --> 59:27.360
Miss Lilly?

59:27.361 --> 59:28.262
Yes.

59:28.263 --> 59:29.130
Good morning.

59:29.131 --> 59:29.996
Hello.

59:29.997 --> 59:30.965
Good morning.

59:30.966 --> 59:31.666
Well, Miss Lilly, how is

59:31.667 --> 59:33.400
Michael Schneider doing?

59:33.401 --> 59:34.835
Mr. Schneider?

59:35.336 --> 59:37.371
Sir, are you related to him?

59:37.372 --> 59:38.972
If not, I can't tell
you anything about him.

59:38.973 --> 59:40.241
Yeah, I know.

59:40.242 --> 59:42.543
We are friends of his is all.

59:42.544 --> 59:46.081
And I'm afraid I
have some sad news

59:46.548 --> 59:48.516
about his father.

59:48.517 --> 59:50.483
And please take good
care of him for me.

59:50.484 --> 59:52.186
Okay?

59:52.187 --> 59:53.655
Yeah.

01:00:49.745 --> 01:00:51.813
Why, why, why?

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:38.646
You are doing really well.

01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:39.612
Thank you.

01:03:39.613 --> 01:03:41.181
Really.

01:03:41.182 --> 01:03:42.450
Mikey!

01:03:44.419 --> 01:03:45.887
Mikey!

01:03:46.354 --> 01:03:48.122
What's up, bud?

01:03:52.327 --> 01:03:53.226
You look good.

01:03:53.227 --> 01:03:54.360
What's up?

01:03:54.361 --> 01:03:55.396
Hey, look at that.

01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:56.896
Who do we have here?

01:03:56.897 --> 01:03:58.866
Training for a rematch?

01:03:58.867 --> 01:04:02.403
You'll have to get
in line, master.

01:04:04.705 --> 01:04:07.141
This fight's yours.

01:04:11.845 --> 01:04:13.514
How are you, dude?

01:04:13.515 --> 01:04:14.414
Good.

01:04:14.415 --> 01:04:15.616
Super.

01:04:15.617 --> 01:04:16.817
Your old friend Frank
here has made sure

01:04:16.818 --> 01:04:19.552
that the fight with
Piotrowski is still on.

01:04:19.553 --> 01:04:21.422
What do you say?

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:23.690
I don't know, Frank.

01:04:23.691 --> 01:04:25.559
In the last few weeks,
I've been through a lot.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.626
Hey.

01:04:26.627 --> 01:04:28.329
Relax, dude.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:29.596
This Russian guy
wants you bad, but he

01:04:29.597 --> 01:04:30.697
wants you just in
the best shape,

01:04:30.698 --> 01:04:31.898
you know what I mean?

01:04:31.899 --> 01:04:33.900
I won't burn out my star.

01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:36.436
We won't burn out
our star, right, Frank?

01:04:36.437 --> 01:04:37.704
We, that's right.

01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:38.972
All right, Mike.

01:04:38.973 --> 01:04:39.873
Take all the time you
need to get fit again

01:04:39.874 --> 01:04:42.010
and then call us.

01:04:42.843 --> 01:04:43.844
No.

01:04:43.845 --> 01:04:46.113
I don't want to go against him.

01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.416
Hey, it's all good, dude.

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:51.351
I saw the Russian guy
fight, he's pretty

01:04:51.352 --> 01:04:53.353
tough, it's true, but
you can finish him.

01:04:53.354 --> 01:04:54.255
Yeah?

01:04:54.256 --> 01:04:55.489
Yeah.

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:59.827
Since when do you know
anything about fighting?

01:05:00.528 --> 01:05:03.496
Hey, it's your turn
to say something.

01:05:03.497 --> 01:05:05.965
We could put
Piotrowski at the rear.

01:05:05.966 --> 01:05:07.300
What?

01:05:07.301 --> 01:05:08.469
Yeah.

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:09.737
We let Mike do
some little fights

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:11.005
to do a comeback.

01:05:11.006 --> 01:05:12.840
And then he can
make a big comeback.

01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:13.974
Yeah!

01:05:13.975 --> 01:05:15.742
Nah.

01:05:15.743 --> 01:05:17.744
It's not about this guy, man.

01:05:17.745 --> 01:05:18.746
I don't want to fight now.

01:05:18.747 --> 01:05:20.748
At least not like this, okay?

01:05:20.749 --> 01:05:21.681
Tell me, what
kind of pills are

01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:24.084
they giving you?

01:05:24.718 --> 01:05:25.619
Now stop it, it
was that queer old

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.753
Jap guy, right?

01:05:26.754 --> 01:05:28.054
What did he do to you, man?

01:05:28.055 --> 01:05:31.025
Things that you
would never understand.

01:05:32.026 --> 01:05:33.626
Did he drum some
far eastern fight

01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:35.862
philosophy into you or
something like that, yeah?

01:05:35.863 --> 01:05:37.463
No.

01:05:37.464 --> 01:05:39.333
But he was here.

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:42.469
That's all he did?

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:44.304
He was here?

01:05:44.305 --> 01:05:46.539
And naturally I wasn't, yeah.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.476
Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:05:51.912 --> 01:05:53.346
You know what?

01:05:53.347 --> 01:05:54.914
That's right, I wasn't here!

01:05:54.915 --> 01:05:56.516
I hate hospitals, all right?

01:05:56.517 --> 01:05:57.751
But think about who you owe all

01:05:57.752 --> 01:06:00.054
your money to, you
ungrateful asshole!

01:06:00.955 --> 01:06:02.322
What would you be without me?

01:06:02.323 --> 01:06:03.023
Nothing!

01:06:03.024 --> 01:06:04.590
Nobody!

01:06:04.591 --> 01:06:05.958
You push away your
friends, I don't need you,

01:06:05.959 --> 01:06:06.893
you depend on us!

01:06:06.894 --> 01:06:07.795
Come on, let's go.

01:06:07.796 --> 01:06:08.661
I'm sorry about this.

01:06:08.662 --> 01:06:09.530
Come on.

01:06:09.531 --> 01:06:10.431
Excuse me, sir.

01:06:10.432 --> 01:06:11.331
Please, be quiet.

01:06:11.332 --> 01:06:12.532
Yeah, go on.

01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:13.400
Just walk away, you'll
see what happens!

01:06:13.401 --> 01:06:13.967
This is hospital.

01:06:13.968 --> 01:06:14.735
Why should I?

01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:15.702
Sorry.

01:06:15.703 --> 01:06:16.570
Please, control yourselves.

01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:18.874
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

01:06:24.845 --> 01:06:28.415
So, time to change
your dressing.

01:06:34.856 --> 01:06:36.323
Hey?

01:06:36.825 --> 01:06:38.293
Hello?

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:44.298
I guess we'll do it later.

01:06:52.439 --> 01:06:54.275
She's pretty.

01:06:54.809 --> 01:06:56.110
Really?

01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:58.178
I didn't notice.

01:06:59.781 --> 01:07:02.116
You may ask her out.

01:07:02.117 --> 01:07:04.151
Not a chance.

01:07:04.551 --> 01:07:07.454
Maybe she doesn't like you?

01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:11.059
Because

01:07:12.526 --> 01:07:13.994
whatever.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:37.351
Please make sure
Dr. Wheet gets this.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.427
The light's on.

01:07:47.428 --> 01:07:49.164
I'll go check.

01:07:53.901 --> 01:07:55.568
Boy am I glad you came

01:07:55.569 --> 01:07:57.771
and not that male nurse.

01:07:57.772 --> 01:07:59.873
What's this all about?

01:07:59.874 --> 01:08:01.942
It's my last evening here

01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:05.179
and I'd like to
spend it with you.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:07.648
That's really nice of you,

01:08:07.649 --> 01:08:09.683
but I have to decline.

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.684
Hey, this is a specialty from

01:08:11.685 --> 01:08:13.454
Chef Master Lee.

01:08:13.455 --> 01:08:15.188
Yeah, it really
looks quite delicious,

01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:16.657
actually.

01:08:17.758 --> 01:08:20.060
But I could lose
my job over this.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:20.926
Yeah.

01:08:20.928 --> 01:08:23.063
I can understand.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.599
Thank you for everything.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.868
I'm glad that
you're better again.

01:08:27.868 --> 01:08:28.769
Hey.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:29.903
Just wait a minute.

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:31.372
Okay.

01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:39.813
Well,

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:42.216
maybe you can call me?

01:08:42.216 --> 01:08:43.484
Yes.

01:08:43.484 --> 01:08:44.752
Maybe.

01:09:09.977 --> 01:09:12.246
Food has arrived!

01:09:14.113 --> 01:09:15.582
Lee!

01:09:16.216 --> 01:09:18.216
You shouldn't have come today.

01:09:18.218 --> 01:09:19.987
I'm out of here
in a little while.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.020
I know that.

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.090
Come, my friend.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.229
Here, my friend.

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.368
My specialty.

01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:36.604
Extra for you.

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:38.104
Really?

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:39.573
Yeah.

01:09:42.075 --> 01:09:44.676
But, they came and
took my fork away.

01:09:44.678 --> 01:09:46.346
One moment.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.783
I actually came
prepared for this.

01:09:51.785 --> 01:09:54.621
Lee, you're unbelievable.

01:09:55.556 --> 01:09:57.623
I can't wait to see what
you whipped up today.

01:09:57.624 --> 01:09:58.324
Really?

01:09:58.325 --> 01:10:00.193
Yeah.

01:10:02.629 --> 01:10:05.700
This time you have to eat it.

01:10:08.735 --> 01:10:10.204
Here.

01:10:12.806 --> 01:10:14.409
Thank you.

01:10:18.913 --> 01:10:20.747
All right.

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:23.649
My friend!

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:25.886
It's just a lesson!

01:10:25.887 --> 01:10:26.886
A lesson!

01:10:26.887 --> 01:10:28.055
A lesson?

01:10:28.056 --> 01:10:29.689
A lesson, that's right.

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.658
Now I'll give you a
lesson or two, my friend.

01:10:31.659 --> 01:10:32.926
Don't eat it!

01:10:32.927 --> 01:10:33.926
I will.

01:10:33.927 --> 01:10:35.061
No, it's just a lesson.

01:10:35.062 --> 01:10:35.929
A lesson, a lesson.

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:36.829
Yeah.

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:37.730
Now let me do it!

01:10:37.731 --> 01:10:39.299
No, no!

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.934
All right, come on.

01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:42.903
Can't believe you ate it.

01:10:42.904 --> 01:10:44.070
Gross.

01:10:44.071 --> 01:10:45.540
Crazy!

01:10:49.209 --> 01:10:50.377
Whoops.

01:10:50.378 --> 01:10:51.846
Hey!

01:10:56.717 --> 01:10:57.951
These are your
discharge papers.

01:10:57.952 --> 01:10:59.086
I just need a signature from you

01:10:59.087 --> 01:11:00.386
right here, please.

01:11:00.387 --> 01:11:01.755
Okay.

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:03.957
Mr. Schneider, you're
leaving us today?

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:05.359
Yeah.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.930
All right, then no
martial arts for six weeks.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.907
Hello?

01:11:20.842 --> 01:11:22.310
Hello?

01:11:23.378 --> 01:11:24.846
No idea.

01:11:26.047 --> 01:11:27.515
Hey.

01:11:27.914 --> 01:11:30.450
Now you have my number.

01:11:31.084 --> 01:11:33.854
And now that you're
not a patient anymore,

01:11:33.855 --> 01:11:35.354
well, maybe you would like to go

01:11:35.355 --> 01:11:37.189
do something together?

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:38.992
Yeah, maybe.

01:11:38.993 --> 01:11:40.292
Okay, great.

01:11:40.293 --> 01:11:42.028
Call me.

01:11:42.029 --> 01:11:43.063
I will.

01:11:43.064 --> 01:11:43.997
'til then.

01:11:43.998 --> 01:11:45.466
Ciao.

01:12:33.815 --> 01:12:35.283
Yeah!

01:13:01.842 --> 01:13:03.342
And, cut!

01:13:03.343 --> 01:13:04.812
Yeah!

01:13:06.047 --> 01:13:08.283
He's our man, dude.

01:13:29.803 --> 01:13:31.071
Shit.

01:14:16.918 --> 01:14:19.921
What do you think about him?

01:14:25.092 --> 01:14:26.561
Really?

01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:28.929
Yeah.

01:15:13.039 --> 01:15:14.508
Relax.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.394
Be careful.

01:15:34.395 --> 01:15:36.697
The knife is sharp.

01:17:34.347 --> 01:17:35.950
Hey, baby.

01:17:37.752 --> 01:17:39.085
Everything all right?

01:17:39.086 --> 01:17:40.052
Yeah.

01:17:40.053 --> 01:17:41.589
All's good.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.493
I'm proud of you.

01:17:47.494 --> 01:17:48.360
Yeah?

01:17:48.361 --> 01:17:49.429
Yeah.

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.933
You didn't beat that guy up.

01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:19.318
Maybe we should stop all this.

01:19:20.186 --> 01:19:21.587
Are you being actually serious?

01:19:21.588 --> 01:19:22.689
Frank, we can't
give the people

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:23.856
what they want to see anymore.

01:19:23.857 --> 01:19:26.592
Man, we're just in a rut!

01:19:26.593 --> 01:19:27.860
Whatever.

01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:29.330
Goodnight.

01:19:30.663 --> 01:19:32.932
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:35.302
Peace out.

01:20:52.212 --> 01:20:53.345
Good morning.

01:20:53.346 --> 01:20:55.148
Good morning.

01:20:55.783 --> 01:20:56.649
Thought I was
gonna have to peel

01:20:56.650 --> 01:20:58.417
you off the floor.

01:20:58.418 --> 01:21:00.552
No, no, no, no
time for that shit.

01:21:00.553 --> 01:21:01.554
While you were
sleeping, I saved our

01:21:01.555 --> 01:21:03.890
ass last night.

01:21:04.757 --> 01:21:06.492
The all wanna see Mike, yeah?

01:21:06.493 --> 01:21:08.595
So we'll give them Mike.

01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:10.963
And are we forgetting
something there?

01:21:10.964 --> 01:21:12.765
Mike's not doing it anymore.

01:21:12.766 --> 01:21:14.567
Exactly right.

01:21:14.568 --> 01:21:16.935
But he's left us with
no other choice here.

01:21:16.936 --> 01:21:18.770
We only need him
for just one fight,

01:21:18.771 --> 01:21:20.439
which he'll lose.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.841
So you want to fake it?

01:21:21.842 --> 01:21:23.310
No.

01:21:23.877 --> 01:21:25.310
We'll simply do it
with Mike like he did

01:21:25.311 --> 01:21:27.247
with his other opponents.

01:21:27.248 --> 01:21:29.414
We'll force him to fight.

01:21:29.415 --> 01:21:31.618
Don't you think
that's going too far?

01:21:31.619 --> 01:21:34.586
I mean, he is our friend.

01:21:34.587 --> 01:21:36.923
Pfft, no he's not.

01:21:37.524 --> 01:21:39.359
We were just business
partners, okay?

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.496
And this dude took a shit on us.

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.331
So now come on.

01:21:45.332 --> 01:21:46.332
We have an appointment
with someone

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:48.502
who will kick Mike's ass.

01:21:51.538 --> 01:21:53.207
Hey, come on.

01:21:54.641 --> 01:21:56.110
No.

01:21:57.343 --> 01:21:59.711
I won't do that, Frank.

01:21:59.712 --> 01:22:03.015
And you should also
think about it.

01:22:03.016 --> 01:22:04.449
You want me to think?

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:06.985
What you want
to do is not okay.

01:22:06.986 --> 01:22:08.621
So long as
you were raking in

01:22:08.622 --> 01:22:10.289
the money out of it,
it was okay?

01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:13.960
We both know this
isn't right, man.

01:22:15.029 --> 01:22:17.965
Don't tell me that, man.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.204
Yeah, I've been an asshole.

01:22:23.837 --> 01:22:27.341
But at least I'm
not a false asshole.

01:22:54.935 --> 01:22:57.170
What an unexpected
surprise to see you here.

01:22:58.471 --> 01:22:59.905
Don't panic, please.

01:22:59.906 --> 01:23:02.809
The police, your friends
and helpers are here.

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:05.377
Be a good man and put
that knife away, please.

01:23:05.378 --> 01:23:06.981
I'm sorry.

01:23:07.847 --> 01:23:09.582
So how do you all feel?

01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:11.051
Relaxed?

01:23:11.618 --> 01:23:12.551
But?

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:14.820
Everything's fine.

01:23:14.821 --> 01:23:18.291
So you work here,
Mr. Schneider?

01:23:25.365 --> 01:23:29.570
Smells a bit rancid in
here, don't you think?

01:23:35.007 --> 01:23:38.144
Can we help you, inspector?

01:23:38.611 --> 01:23:40.080
You can.

01:23:40.446 --> 01:23:41.915
Guys!

01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:52.792
Arrest these two men here.

01:23:52.793 --> 01:23:54.993
What are you accusing us of?

01:23:54.994 --> 01:23:56.496
You could be
working illegally.

01:23:56.497 --> 01:23:57.596
I'm sure we'll find something.

01:23:57.597 --> 01:23:58.597
Hey!

01:23:58.598 --> 01:24:00.132
We all have our working permits!

01:24:00.133 --> 01:24:01.602
Hey!

01:24:02.136 --> 01:24:04.103
Chinamen all
look the same?

01:24:04.104 --> 01:24:06.439
What is this shit?

01:24:06.973 --> 01:24:09.343
I'm coming for you.

01:24:18.584 --> 01:24:22.055
Don't forget to
clean the kitchen.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:33.765
Hey.

01:24:33.766 --> 01:24:35.702
You back so soon?

01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.974
What's the matter?

01:24:42.176 --> 01:24:45.312
There was a raid in
the restaurant today.

01:24:45.779 --> 01:24:48.514
The police guy, Ritter,

01:24:48.515 --> 01:24:49.981
saw me in the
hospital, that guy.

01:24:49.982 --> 01:24:51.149
Yeah?

01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:54.521
He arrested
everyone except me.

01:24:54.954 --> 01:24:55.854
What?

01:24:55.855 --> 01:24:57.556
How come?

01:24:57.557 --> 01:24:58.890
Immigration, working permits,

01:24:58.891 --> 01:25:01.127
that kind of thing.

01:25:01.128 --> 01:25:04.063
He had a real good time.

01:25:04.064 --> 01:25:06.631
And what about Lee?

01:25:06.632 --> 01:25:09.502
Lee came back
half an hour ago.

01:25:09.503 --> 01:25:12.171
The guests were already gone.

01:25:12.172 --> 01:25:13.238
You know, I believe
he did it just

01:25:13.239 --> 01:25:15.207
to get to me.

01:25:15.208 --> 01:25:16.108
No.

01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:17.676
That can't be.

01:25:17.677 --> 01:25:21.414
He's a policeman,
it's his job, right?

01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:26.018
I bet you're right.

01:25:26.019 --> 01:25:28.488
You know what you
did makes me so proud.

01:25:28.489 --> 01:25:29.622
Yeah?

01:25:29.623 --> 01:25:31.091
How come?

01:25:31.859 --> 01:25:33.059
Because I see
there's a good man

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.762
inside of you.

01:25:41.735 --> 01:25:43.203
Hello?

01:25:44.104 --> 01:25:45.572
Frank?

01:25:50.177 --> 01:25:52.713
I'm here for the fight.

01:25:54.847 --> 01:25:57.817
Wait, not without the camera.

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.423
Fuck it.

01:27:09.122 --> 01:27:11.222
You know, Andre,

01:27:11.223 --> 01:27:15.060
I'm afraid it's not
working out with you.

01:27:15.061 --> 01:27:16.228
For my next project, you're just

01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:19.566
not the right one,
unfortunately.

01:27:20.801 --> 01:27:22.601
But with this, man,

01:27:22.602 --> 01:27:25.872
you just contributed
to the cause.

01:28:23.696 --> 01:28:27.733
You're a little bit
too late, aren't you?

01:28:30.803 --> 01:28:33.874
Now that's some shitty weather.

01:28:39.079 --> 01:28:40.278
Against the wall.

01:28:40.279 --> 01:28:41.146
What?

01:28:41.147 --> 01:28:43.416
Against the wall!

01:28:47.454 --> 01:28:48.988
All right, Ritter.

01:28:48.989 --> 01:28:51.424
I believe you don't
care for me at all.

01:28:51.425 --> 01:28:52.891
I was an asshole, I hung around

01:28:52.892 --> 01:28:54.861
some bad company.

01:28:56.262 --> 01:28:58.463
But that's not me anymore.

01:28:58.464 --> 01:29:02.268
I'm trying to leave
the past behind me.

01:29:02.269 --> 01:29:03.703
Please believe me

01:29:03.704 --> 01:29:06.240
and please accept that.

01:29:08.307 --> 01:29:10.876
Just a routine check.

01:29:12.412 --> 01:29:14.380
See you around.

01:29:19.985 --> 01:29:22.321
You're late, Mike.

01:29:23.989 --> 01:29:25.992
And in a bad mood.

01:29:43.909 --> 01:29:45.544
What's wrong?

01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:50.349
That fucking pig, Ritter.

01:29:59.825 --> 01:30:03.429
Every kick, every
hit has fallout.

01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:07.300
What do you mean by that?

01:30:10.203 --> 01:30:13.607
Sweep it up and
think about it.

01:30:48.275 --> 01:30:50.975
Hey, man, that was fucked.

01:30:50.976 --> 01:30:52.845
It's a lesson.

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.052
I wonder what
you'll be like when

01:31:01.053 --> 01:31:03.456
you're an old master.

01:31:05.425 --> 01:31:07.094
Quite wise.

01:31:24.144 --> 01:31:25.377
There's the inspector.

01:31:25.378 --> 01:31:26.278
I gotta go.

01:31:26.279 --> 01:31:27.747
See you.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.784
You want to talk to me?

01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:36.055
Would you please
explain to me how

01:31:36.056 --> 01:31:38.623
this was among your stuff?

01:31:38.624 --> 01:31:40.826
That's not mine.

01:31:42.462 --> 01:31:44.631
Really, it isn't.

01:31:49.002 --> 01:31:50.368
My girlfriend
has nothing to do

01:31:50.369 --> 01:31:51.502
with this, okay?

01:31:51.503 --> 01:31:54.073
They are horrendous
accusations.

01:31:54.074 --> 01:31:55.675
I'm shocked.

01:31:56.141 --> 01:31:58.611
I'm just doing my job.

01:31:59.212 --> 01:32:02.883
It seems like you
keep some bad company.

01:32:04.417 --> 01:32:06.653
You?

01:32:07.486 --> 01:32:09.089
Hello, Mike.

01:32:09.489 --> 01:32:11.758
Nice day, isn't it?

01:32:13.126 --> 01:32:15.094
What's going on here?

01:32:15.095 --> 01:32:17.528
It's quite simple.

01:32:17.529 --> 01:32:18.963
Our common business
venture has had

01:32:18.964 --> 01:32:22.234
kind of an authenticity
problem since you left.

01:32:22.235 --> 01:32:23.601
Come on, I'm out.

01:32:23.602 --> 01:32:25.304
Yeah.

01:32:25.305 --> 01:32:28.506
But our fans just want you in.

01:32:28.507 --> 01:32:30.109
I have continued
our website with

01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:32.310
other fighters to try
and keep the story going.

01:32:32.311 --> 01:32:34.914
But nobody was like you.

01:32:35.547 --> 01:32:36.916
Nobody could prove
that they could

01:32:36.917 --> 01:32:39.251
knock you out because
you, my friend,

01:32:39.252 --> 01:32:40.586
weren't around for anyone to try

01:32:40.587 --> 01:32:42.186
and attempt it.

01:32:42.187 --> 01:32:43.656
But now,

01:32:44.156 --> 01:32:47.059
That's right, spot on.

01:32:48.328 --> 01:32:50.296
You were right, Mike.

01:32:50.297 --> 01:32:52.765
Ritter really wanted
to knock you out.

01:32:56.136 --> 01:32:57.202
My business sense was totally on

01:32:57.203 --> 01:32:59.137
the wrong track at that time.

01:32:59.138 --> 01:33:00.305
I'm sorry.

01:33:00.306 --> 01:33:02.675
And what do you want with me?

01:33:02.676 --> 01:33:04.211
Mike.

01:33:06.012 --> 01:33:07.278
I understand that
you don't want to

01:33:07.279 --> 01:33:10.015
do any of this business anymore.

01:33:10.016 --> 01:33:11.417
Really?

01:33:11.418 --> 01:33:14.554
You put in a lot of effort.

01:33:15.187 --> 01:33:16.587
And that's why I
just want one last

01:33:16.588 --> 01:33:19.024
little fight from you.

01:33:19.025 --> 01:33:20.559
Our common friend
here has promised that

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.798
you can retire once
and for all after that.

01:33:26.266 --> 01:33:28.502
And if I decline?

01:33:30.302 --> 01:33:32.438
A record of drug
possession mustn't be

01:33:32.439 --> 01:33:35.174
too good for a nurse's record.

01:33:35.175 --> 01:33:36.643
Yeah.

01:33:38.278 --> 01:33:39.578
Bastard.

01:33:39.579 --> 01:33:41.147
Watch it.

01:33:43.216 --> 01:33:46.920
Well, you heard
our proposal, Mike.

01:33:47.686 --> 01:33:51.191
Think about it,
you have my number.

01:33:55.061 --> 01:33:57.664
Where's my girlfriend?

01:33:59.164 --> 01:34:01.033
Please, take her home.

01:34:01.034 --> 01:34:03.670
Second door on the right.

01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.956
They're bluffing us, right?

01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:26.793
Bluffing, no.

01:34:27.427 --> 01:34:31.831
Frank is too greedy and
Ritter's too zealous.

01:34:32.632 --> 01:34:34.801
What should I do?

01:34:35.802 --> 01:34:38.138
Time for a lesson.

01:34:41.641 --> 01:34:44.611
Sometimes a man must fight.

01:34:59.825 --> 01:35:01.159
Frank, you want
to dirty your hands

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.629
after all?

01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:06.165
Let's not kid around.

01:35:06.699 --> 01:35:08.168
Frank.

01:35:08.668 --> 01:35:12.136
I really don't want to do this.

01:35:12.137 --> 01:35:15.274
I remember the Chinaman
didn't want it, either.

01:35:15.275 --> 01:35:16.408
Yeah, but you didn't
give him a chance

01:35:16.409 --> 01:35:19.312
to say no to it, now did you?

01:35:19.712 --> 01:35:21.180
You see?

01:35:22.481 --> 01:35:24.351
So, enough talk.

01:35:32.257 --> 01:35:34.960
Now this is how you
put on a show, right?

01:35:36.829 --> 01:35:37.829
Well, now I guess
you don't want

01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:39.230
to talk about this?

01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:40.700
Right?

01:35:48.807 --> 01:35:50.109
Stop jumping around
and give the people

01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:52.379
what they want to see!

01:36:02.187 --> 01:36:04.323
I don't want this!

01:36:05.124 --> 01:36:08.428
You should have
stayed at home, boy.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.573
Yeah, now the fans
can see your ruin

01:36:22.574 --> 01:36:24.309
up close, man.

01:36:33.418 --> 01:36:34.887
Hey!

01:36:35.821 --> 01:36:37.290
No!

01:36:37.623 --> 01:36:39.224
Man, the camera's not running

01:36:39.225 --> 01:36:40.559
and if you finish him
now, I won't have it.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.528
Make that fucking thing work.

01:36:42.529 --> 01:36:44.363
I'll crush him.

01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.215
Shit!

01:37:09.855 --> 01:37:11.990
We're finished!

01:37:14.894 --> 01:37:17.362
Nothing is finished.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.533
I will crush you with
or without a camera.

01:37:22.534 --> 01:37:24.735
Fuck the damn video!

01:37:24.736 --> 01:37:27.807
There will be a video.

01:37:28.208 --> 01:37:31.277
Please keep smiling, inspector.

01:37:35.614 --> 01:37:36.715
What the?

01:37:36.716 --> 01:37:38.451
We have him.

01:37:39.953 --> 01:37:42.587
The video won't
be on the internet,

01:37:42.588 --> 01:37:44.323
but I guess your
superiors will find it

01:37:44.324 --> 01:37:46.757
to be quite interesting.

01:37:46.758 --> 01:37:50.295
The end of a very
promising career.

01:37:54.766 --> 01:37:57.436
Ritter, are you insane?

01:38:47.654 --> 01:38:50.924
Would have been a good video.

01:39:09.976 --> 01:39:11.042
I never thought
this dude would

01:39:11.043 --> 01:39:12.944
pull a knife on you.

01:39:12.945 --> 01:39:15.014
I never thought.

01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:20.952
Master Lee, it's not
what it looks like,

01:39:20.953 --> 01:39:22.421
that dude

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:36.068
Well, that's unlike you.

01:39:36.069 --> 01:39:37.536
Control overload.

01:39:37.537 --> 01:39:39.072
It happens!

01:40:20.445 --> 01:40:22.048
Mr. Frank.

01:40:46.838 --> 01:40:49.174
Come on, let's go!

01:41:02.555 --> 01:41:03.454
Get in!

01:41:03.455 --> 01:41:05.058
Go, go, go!

01:41:06.758 --> 01:41:08.593
Hey, go, drive!

01:41:18.538 --> 01:41:19.438
Bye!

01:41:19.439 --> 01:41:20.706
See ya.

01:41:35.053 --> 01:41:36.522
Yeah?

01:41:45.198 --> 01:41:46.664
Schneider.

01:41:46.665 --> 01:41:49.734
I heard you're
considering a holiday.

01:41:49.735 --> 01:41:51.903
I suggest Hong Kong.

01:41:51.904 --> 01:41:55.940
And your girlfriend
is already with us.

01:41:55.941 --> 01:41:57.074
What?

01:41:57.075 --> 01:41:59.678
Schneider, we'll see you.
