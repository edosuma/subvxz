WEBVTT

00:06.131 --> 00:08.167
Ray Seward,

00:08.217 --> 00:10.959
be it known
you have been found guilty

00:10.969 --> 00:12.675
by jury of your peers

00:12.721 --> 00:15.212
for the crime of murder
in the first degree

00:15.265 --> 00:17.881
of Trisha Ann Seward.

00:17.935 --> 00:22.520
I am hereby authorized
to cause the sentence of death

00:22.523 --> 00:26.937
to be executed upon you
at this time.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.148
Mr. Seward, would you like
to make a final statement

00:30.197 --> 00:32.734
before we proceed?

00:32.783 --> 00:35.820
Mr. Seward?

01:11.113 --> 01:15.573
We got 12 hours, gentlemen.
Clock starts now.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.988
Here you go.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.877
Gate.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.783
You didn't call yesterday.
I waited.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.489
I had other things
to deal with.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.119
And now your schedule's clear,

02:45.165 --> 02:48.498
11 hours
before they're set to kill me?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.206
Do you recognize
any of these rings?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.246
What happened
to your face--

02:54.299 --> 02:56.540
your boyfriend
finally had enough?

02:58.220 --> 03:00.677
Do you or don't you recognize
any of these?

03:00.722 --> 03:01.586
Should I?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.426
Is it
my get-out-of-jail-free card?

03:03.475 --> 03:04.715
It's a yes-or-no question.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.429
I'm not the one
on a clock here.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.888
True.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.974
The wedding band--
silver--

03:09.981 --> 03:14.725
it's a fake,
in case you were wondering.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.360
Is there anything specific
you can tell me about this ring?

03:17.447 --> 03:19.824
The fact I didn't want to give it to her?
She was pregnant.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.903
What about any markings,
any imperfections it might have?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.193
Do you recall
anything like that?

03:24.246 --> 03:26.282
I recall that it cost 30 bucks.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.743
I recall I got it
at Bernard's Jewelry

03:28.750 --> 03:32.709
near the market--
used goods, like my wife.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.328
And I recall,
after I gave it to her,

03:34.381 --> 03:35.746
I never thought about it again.

03:35.799 --> 03:40.168
Do you believe
in "happily ever after"?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.505
Hmm?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.216
I didn't think so,

03:43.265 --> 03:46.052
'cause I noticed you weren't
wearing a band, either.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.638
Uh...

03:56.027 --> 03:59.690
There's a scratch
on the inside band.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.623
I have to make a call.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.173
He positively identified
the ring

04:20.218 --> 04:22.504
as belonging to his deceased
wife, Trisha Seward,

04:22.554 --> 04:25.261
and it was found in the trophies
in Joe Mills' possession.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.511
Sir, ifI didn't believe

04:29.519 --> 04:31.350
an innocent man was
about to be executed,

04:31.438 --> 04:32.678
I wouldn't be bothering you.

04:35.025 --> 04:39.143
Yeah, H can get that, yes.
Right away.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.993
Holder, where are you?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.653
I, um-- I need the Seward file.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.617
I need the photos.
It's important.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.203
I'm-- I'm here at the prison,
so call me, okay?

04:54.252 --> 04:57.460
I can't leave, or else they
won't let me visit Seward again.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.671
I need the file right away.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.223
Meat Lover's
breakfast burrito.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.777
Damn, that smells good.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.898
You want a bite?

05:25.951 --> 05:30.820
You know they got a cemetery
right outside these gates?

05:30.872 --> 05:35.787
346 inmates buried there
from the 18005.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.543
No names, no one
ever claimed them.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.839
Wonder what that must be like,

05:39.840 --> 05:43.458
spending eternity as a nobody.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.962
Who's claiming you, Seward?

06:00.610 --> 06:03.727
Hey.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.769
You okay?

06:04.823 --> 06:06.779
I'm a vital part of the team.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.111
Nobody can perform
my duties but me.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.651
You do understand
the concept of duty...

06:11.663 --> 06:13.619
responsibility?

06:13.665 --> 06:14.871
Yeah.
I understand.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.206
Yeah.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.459
You're on death watch
till 6:00 PM, showtime.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.710
Sit outside his cell,

06:20.755 --> 06:22.791
make sure your buddy in there
doesn't cheat the hangman.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.253
Open the gates.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.841
What about a receipt?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.177
Even if the jewelry shop
closed down,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.933
the records could be
with the previous owner.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.772
Yeah, I-I know
it's a long shot,

06:40.817 --> 06:43.354
but I'm sure
the Attorney General's Office

06:43.403 --> 06:45.314
has the manpower to find it.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.490
Yes, I understand
that's not your job.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.870
I'll have something soon.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.502
Come on, let's go.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.389
Not you, her.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.364
- What did they say?
- The Attorney General

07:31.368 --> 07:33.529
needs corroborating evidence
about the ring

07:33.578 --> 07:36.240
before he's willing to move
forward and consider a stay.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.905
- I told you it's hers.
- That's not enough.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.033
And that jewelry shop's
gone out of business.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.873
I have some photos that might
have your wife's ring in them.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.871
Photos of the crime scene?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.416
N0, from the apartment. I'm
waiting for them to get here.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.918
Is that what happens to your
things after you're killed--

07:51.972 --> 07:54.088
they're put in some basement
at the police station?

07:54.140 --> 07:58.179
Unless someone claims them, yes,
and then they're destroyed.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.853
Did you notice the larch trees
when you drove in?

08:07.862 --> 08:10.148
Do you have a friend coming
today to be here with you?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.780
I asked your partner,
but he declined the invite.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.908
There's two of them...

08:14.953 --> 08:18.241
on the east side
of the building.

08:18.289 --> 08:22.077
Is that where your cell looks
out-- on the east side?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.742
Yeah.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.793
- Is he here?
- Mm-hmm.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.929
What does he look like?

08:35.974 --> 08:39.432
He's tall for his age.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.592
He's a good-looking boy.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.351
He likes drawing

08:42.439 --> 08:45.681
and, uh, I think sports.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.771
There's-- there's a mitt
in his room, a catcher's mask.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.811
Does your son play baseball?

08:56.911 --> 08:59.288
He did
when he was Adrian's age.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.697
Your son doesn't live with you?

09:04.294 --> 09:06.956
No.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.496
Sometimes it's better that way.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.016
I keep hearing things--

09:21.061 --> 09:22.972
not voices, nothing crazy
like that,

09:23.021 --> 09:25.728
but the fluorescents--
do you hear them, the buzzing?

09:25.732 --> 09:28.565
There was a lady in the hall
earlier, complaining.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.693
That's Adrian's foster mom.
She's here, too.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.069
We met.

09:33.114 --> 09:38.108
Everyone comes to ask you for things
when they know you're gonna die.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.321
What did she want?

09:39.370 --> 09:42.988
Same thing you do--
for me to see Adrian.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.752
You both seem to think
it'll do him some good.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.458
It's the adrenaline--

09:54.511 --> 09:57.799
when you hear everything,
you smell everything,

09:57.847 --> 10:01.886
you see it all, but it's
like you're in a tunnel.

10:01.935 --> 10:06.770
Everything's moving slowly
but happening so quickly, too.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.821
Get up.
Hands behind your back.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.023
What?

10:15.073 --> 10:17.906
- Get up!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.566
- No. No.
- W-where are you taking him?!

10:19.619 --> 10:21.610
- I'm not done.
- Let's go! Let's go!

10:21.663 --> 10:22.698
Hey! Hey!

10:22.747 --> 10:25.534
- Shut up! Let's go!
- Hey! I'm a cop!

10:25.542 --> 10:27.874
- Move! - Hey! - I can sit here
and talk all day ifI want!

10:27.919 --> 10:29.705
Hey!

10:32.132 --> 10:33.918
I've been sitting in here
for almost an hour,

10:34.008 --> 10:35.134
and nobody's telling me
anything.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.213
Like I said, we got
state-mandated guidelines.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.802
I'm a cop.
You know that, right?

10:39.848 --> 10:41.258
Yeah, you made that clear.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.172
You're also the one
who put him in here,

10:43.226 --> 10:45.057
which you've failed
to mention as much.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.764
He's got a right to have
visitors for another five hours.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.147
You can't just keep him
back there.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.680
Oh, we're talking about his
rights now? You kidding me?

10:50.733 --> 10:54.646
DOC policy 43-603.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.770
I'll call your captain myself
if you've got a problem

10:56.823 --> 10:58.484
following
that state-mandated guideline.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.879
- They weighed me again.
- What?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.968
They must have
got it wrong before.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.967
- Jesus.
- What do you mean, they weighed you?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.851
You know,
if my neck doesn't break,

11:28.897 --> 11:30.637
I'll be conscious,
I'll be awake.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.146
It takes six minutes
to die--

11:32.192 --> 11:34.478
six minutes I'll just be hanging
there, suffocating.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.983
It's not gonna come to that.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.441
The Attorney General's
gonna call any minute now.

11:39.949 --> 11:43.658
They keep feeding me today.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.115
Hot dogs for lunch,
side of fries, crumb cake.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.279
That sounds good.

11:47.332 --> 11:51.792
It sucked!

12:02.096 --> 12:03.347
Did you eat?

12:03.431 --> 12:05.797
The vending machine's got
a surprising variety of choices.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.469
You know, the cook here--
the chef--

12:07.518 --> 12:09.600
you know, he takes special care
preparing the last meal.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.011
He really puts in
his best effort.

12:11.022 --> 12:14.560
I hear it's like
a culinary tour de force...

12:14.609 --> 12:15.724
That's good.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.813
...'cause he knows
that most condemned men

12:17.862 --> 12:20.148
are too nervous to eat,
so it'll go back to him.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.569
Is there anything else

12:23.618 --> 12:26.485
that you can tell me
about that ring?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.701
We're running out of time.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.334
I told you everything.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.463
You know, if you go,

12:38.508 --> 12:41.500
they'll just send me
back to my cell.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.053
Okay.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.469
It's a measure
of a person's life, I think,

12:53.523 --> 12:55.764
those who come see you
in the end.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.229
Your son's here.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.072
It's in the blood, this place.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.235
He shouldn't be.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.488
He's not a little boy any more.
He knows what this place is.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.410
You don't have to be afraid
that he'll--

13:13.459 --> 13:15.415
he'll become like you.

13:18.006 --> 13:23.000
Is it me you're trying
to save, or yourself?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.168
The son you gave away--
what's his name?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.758
Hmm?

13:27.807 --> 13:31.015
Whatever it is,
I hope he likes hot dogs.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.975
You know, my daddy was here,
and his daddy before him.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.982
Maximum security's
like a family tradition.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.769
Is that your excuse?
You're breaking my heart, Ray.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.991
Come on.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.740
Come on. Come on.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.539
I'm not here for you.

13:59.589 --> 14:04.128
That's good,
'cause I'm a piece of trash.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.884
If that's what you want
to call it.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.840
A monster.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.427
No, I've seen monsters before.
You're not one of them.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.512
That's not what you said
at my trial.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.268
You didn't kill your wife.

14:21.736 --> 14:26.150
I beat her...

14:26.199 --> 14:29.532
Sometimes in front of Adrian.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.659
I took out
a 20-year-old's eye.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.741
I crushed a man's jaw
with a metal pipe

14:34.791 --> 14:39.000
so that he'll eat through a
straw for the rest of his life.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.377
ReaHy?

14:41.422 --> 14:45.335
I don't have any illusions
about you, the men in here.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.501
So why are you here?

14:47.553 --> 14:50.636
Because I made a mistake.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.687
My hand--
just give me a minute.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.158
When are you gonna see him?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.588
Oh, man.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.428
I'll be back.
I promise.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.468
What's that?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.630
Hey.
Where have you been?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.504
Out.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.890
- Have you been drinking
since yesterday? - Yeah.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.846
You know this is
a long shot, right--

16:19.854 --> 16:23.438
I mean, scratch on a ring?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.145
You really think the state's
gonna give you a stay for that?

16:26.194 --> 16:28.059
I mean, they don't
even do that with DNA.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.946
Gonna talk to him?

16:39.707 --> 16:41.538
You do it.
You're good with kids.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.085
How's Seward?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.507
He's fine, considering.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.789
I have to go back in.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.416
Yeah. I'm here, you know,
whatever you need--

16:52.428 --> 16:54.168
smokes or whatnot.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.430
I got the party pack.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.261
Want a smoke?

17:37.306 --> 17:40.890
You don't smoke?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.559
Hey, you messing up your kicks,

17:47.608 --> 17:49.815
your ma is gonna get ornery.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.566
She can't tell me what to do.

17:51.612 --> 17:52.943
Oh, you the big man?

17:52.947 --> 17:56.485
You buy for your own stuff
with your five-finger salary?

17:56.492 --> 17:59.234
You're acting drunk.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.653
Ain't acting drunk, I am drunk.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.325
About to go get re-upped.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.866
Got to keep that buzz going,
serial chiller that I am.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.936
It's a good match.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.439
The Ding Dong birthday cakes
were my idea.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.154
I didn't know that.
He looks miserable.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.780
I fed my son Twinkies
for breakfast a few times.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.699
This is good.
Looks like a match to the ring.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.321
Okay.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.160
So what's next?

18:47.168 --> 18:49.534
I send the photo to the AG,

18:49.545 --> 18:51.251
and we see what he says.

18:55.551 --> 19:00.341
Adrian's still waiting
to see you, Ray.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.720
And I bet he's not gonna leave

19:01.766 --> 19:03.381
as long as there's
still a chance.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.766
You know, I wasn't even there
when he was born.

19:05.811 --> 19:10.805
I told Trish to get
an abortion.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.933
I kind of hated him, actually.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.442
I bet you can relate.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.821
I know what you're doing.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.659
I'll be back.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.945
Yeah, well,
I got to take a leak anyway.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.078
Yeah, you do that.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.330
Yes, I'll hold
for the Attorney General.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.710
Sir? Yes,
this is Detective Linden.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.467
I appreciate you considering
a stay, sir. Thank you.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.988
He went to get beer.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.773
Yeah?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.242
I saw your dad.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.041
He was-- he was real curious
about you.

20:16.090 --> 20:20.129
He asked a-a lot of questions
about you.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.218
He did.

20:22.263 --> 20:26.256
Can I still see him,
even ifI lied?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.640
That's not why
you're waiting here,

20:28.686 --> 20:30.927
because of what
you told me, okay?

20:30.980 --> 20:32.845
And I'm not mad at you.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.561
I knew you were just trying
to help your dad.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.647
Why would you get your dad
in trouble?

20:43.701 --> 20:47.034
Because he was there
that night.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.788
He was the one I saw.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.803
What did they say?

22:26.846 --> 22:29.212
The Attorney General is
considering the new evidence.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.254
It's a long shot,

22:30.307 --> 22:32.298
but he's considering
a potential stay.

22:33.352 --> 22:37.436
Ah.

22:37.481 --> 22:40.268
They were gonna serve
my last meal in an hour.

22:40.317 --> 22:44.856
Salisbury steak
and vanilla ice cream.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.816
Send it back!

22:46.866 --> 22:49.073
I know that you were there
that night.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.284
That's why
Adrian's never been able

22:52.329 --> 22:55.036
to talk about it, remember it--
because he saw you.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.828
- What are you talking about?
- Please don't lie to me.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.786
You were there,
you son of a bitch.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.003
You played me.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.458
I was there, I wasn't there.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.339
You know,
it doesn't matter what I say

23:06.427 --> 23:08.338
because you've already
made up your mind,

23:08.429 --> 23:09.418
just like the others.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.966
Guilty until proven
innocent--

23:11.015 --> 23:13.552
let me tell you, that's the way
it's always been with me.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.091
You lied to me!

23:15.144 --> 23:16.930
You want me to say
I killed her?

23:16.979 --> 23:20.563
Okay. I killed her.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.894
You're not telling me everything
about that night.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.942
Why were you there?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.206
You tell me the truth.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.416
You tell me the truth right this
minute, or I'm walking out,

23:45.466 --> 23:46.330
and any chance you've got
is walking out--

23:46.342 --> 23:48.754
He was in that closet
because I was never there,

23:48.802 --> 23:50.588
his mother leaving him staring

23:50.638 --> 23:53.380
up at those stupid plastic stars
night after night.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.512
Why were you in the apartment?!

23:54.558 --> 23:56.514
My excuse, too,
so I could leave, too.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.175
Seward, answer me!

23:58.228 --> 24:02.141
You think saving me
is some kind of noble act?

24:02.191 --> 24:04.978
I didn't care when I left
every night.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.769
I didn't give a damn
when he screamed at me

24:07.821 --> 24:09.527
not to walk out on him

24:09.573 --> 24:13.157
that night, every night!

24:13.160 --> 24:16.493
- That's who you're saving!
- Why were you in the apartment?!

24:18.874 --> 24:21.115
Guard!

24:22.628 --> 24:24.493
Yo.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.502
Hey, where you going?

24:26.548 --> 24:28.004
He played me.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.540
He lied.
He's been lying all along.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.584
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
What are you talking about?

24:31.637 --> 24:34.049
I shouldn't have come here.
It was a mistake.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.838
He was there in the apartment.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.756
He killed his wife,
end of story.

24:37.768 --> 24:38.803
What about the ring?

24:38.852 --> 24:40.843
You said it yourself.
It could be anybody's.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.432
It doesn't mean anything.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.598
What, so you're just leaving?

24:45.651 --> 24:48.563
You can't. They won't
let you see him again.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.148
- Give me them back.
- No.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.778
- Give them to me, Holder!
- No.

24:51.824 --> 24:57.035
After all this,
you just walk away?

24:57.037 --> 24:59.653
There's lots of reasons
why he could've been there.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.447
- He lived there.
- Then why did he lie about it?

25:01.458 --> 25:04.416
I don't know.
Go in there and ask him!

25:04.420 --> 25:05.876
What about Adrian?

25:05.921 --> 25:08.037
I'm done! I'm done!
Give me the keys!

25:08.090 --> 25:10.547
This is like a pattern with you,
you know that?

25:10.551 --> 25:13.088
You always leaving, running.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.837
- You never stay...
- You're drunk.

25:15.889 --> 25:19.256
...'cause if you did,
then you'd want it.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.845
You'd need it.

25:20.894 --> 25:24.307
And then you could get hurt...

25:24.314 --> 25:26.100
and left...

25:26.150 --> 25:29.483
or not left.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.439
What the hell happened
to you, Linden?

25:31.447 --> 25:32.687
Why you always taking off?

25:34.700 --> 25:35.689
Why don't you just shut up

25:35.743 --> 25:37.074
and take
your own damned advice?

25:37.119 --> 25:40.577
Yeah, maybe I should.

25:40.581 --> 25:44.699
We never stay, and in the end,
we lose everyone.

25:50.632 --> 25:53.795
I'm not gonna try
and kiss you again, Linden.

25:53.844 --> 25:57.132
Keep dreaming.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.719
You hear me? I'm not gonna
kiss you again, Linden.

26:00.768 --> 26:04.807
Unh-unh. You missed
your chance, Linden.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.358
Come on.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.152
Detective Linden.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.158
Yes, sir, I'm still here
at the prison.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.001
I understand, sir.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.504
I appreciate
you taking the time

26:32.549 --> 26:34.585
to consider a stay at all.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.296
I'll let him know.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.208
Are you still here?

27:18.262 --> 27:20.719
Yeah, for Adrian, not for you.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.426
Mm, that's nice...

27:23.433 --> 27:25.685
Because they're gonna kill me

27:25.727 --> 27:32.189
in 1 hour, 56 minutes...
and 9 seconds.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.778
I'm sorry.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.889
It was a nice try, though.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.849
Why were you in the apartment
that night?

28:11.899 --> 28:14.436
Why can't you just tell me?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.440
Maybe you saw something.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.985
Maybe you saw something
that will save your life.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.774
Help me.

28:26.455 --> 28:31.495
If you didn't kill her,
what are you hiding?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.535
Why can't you just tell me?

28:34.588 --> 28:37.796
You know how a kid looks at you

28:37.841 --> 28:41.925
before he's been messed up,
hit every day,

28:41.970 --> 28:44.222
and pushed down,
and called a shit?

28:44.264 --> 28:46.300
You know--
you know that look?

28:46.350 --> 28:48.136
When they still think
the world is big,

28:48.185 --> 28:52.849
and that their life
could be big, too?

28:54.441 --> 28:57.274
Ido...

28:57.319 --> 29:00.356
because I was like that once,

29:00.405 --> 29:03.442
and I wanted that for my son.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.904
You went back to get Adrian.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.664
Ijust walked away
from all that.

29:16.672 --> 29:21.336
Iran, and then, uh--
then I came back for my boy.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.337
See-- see, he needed me.

29:23.387 --> 29:26.550
God, I could've gone away,
but I came back.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.590
I was-- I was gonna bring him
with me.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.813
Things can change.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.439
But, uh...

29:38.485 --> 29:41.067
And I went back there,
and she was lying on the floor.

29:41.113 --> 29:44.230
God.

29:44.283 --> 29:49.027
And I knew that...
nothing does.

29:50.664 --> 29:54.532
Ray.

29:54.584 --> 29:58.042
Adrian's right outside.
He's waiting for you.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.703
Okay.

30:01.675 --> 30:05.418
Don't leave...

30:05.429 --> 30:08.262
without letting him see you,
know you.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.926
He will carry that with him

30:09.933 --> 30:11.924
every time he looks
in the mirror,

30:11.935 --> 30:13.550
the broken parts of you,

30:13.603 --> 30:16.561
because you never let him see
the best part.

30:21.778 --> 30:25.987
I know what it's like
to never have that.

30:29.202 --> 30:34.367
He's waiting for you.
Please.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.440
I got to clean my sneakers.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.446
Adrian, I don't think
we have time for that right now.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.107
Your dad's waiting.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.995
Take them dogs off.
We'll wipe them down.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.254
My hair looks dumb.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.970
It looks fine.
He don't care.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.686
You need gel or something.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.847
It's not gonna stand like that.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.474
You're looking
like Dennis the Menace.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.620
Yeah.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.543
That's it.

32:07.592 --> 32:10.254
That's what I'm talking about,
little man.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.168
Huh?

32:13.974 --> 32:19.685
He's-- he's not gonna be
looking at your shirt, Ray.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.435
You look great.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.854
Yeah? You don't look
so bad yourself.

32:30.574 --> 32:33.532
You know, I built him
a treehouse

32:33.577 --> 32:35.067
when I got out
of the State Pen.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.486
He'd just turned 6.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.122
There are no trees in the city.

32:45.172 --> 32:48.209
We had to go to the park
so he could run around.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.874
Kids should be able
to run around.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.542
Yeah, they should.

32:54.890 --> 32:59.259
He-- he loved
that dumb treehouse.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.480
You know, those trees,
they lost their leaves so fast.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.436
Like, everything goes so fast.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.479
Do you think it'll hurt?

33:12.532 --> 33:14.739
No.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.447
And there's still a chance.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.284
The Governor
can always grant a reprieve.

33:26.254 --> 33:30.714
I know that you did
everything you could for me.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.295
Thank you.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.508
What should I say to him?

33:39.935 --> 33:41.471
I don't know.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.354
Uh, everything.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.832
Get up, inmate, let's go.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.872
Wait, I got a visitation
with my son.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.623
Visiting hours are over.
Sorry.

34:13.677 --> 34:14.883
What? No.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.418
State guidelines mandate

34:16.471 --> 34:17.881
that all visitations terminate

34:17.931 --> 34:22.095
an hour before execution
at 1700 hours.

34:22.102 --> 34:23.888
No, we've been waiting
for half an hour.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.643
It is not his fault
it's taken so long!

34:25.647 --> 34:27.808
- State guidelines mandate that...
- I got a right to see him.

34:27.816 --> 34:29.431
- I want to talk to your superior!
- Get off of me!

34:29.442 --> 34:31.933
- This is unbelievable!
- I'll get you his number.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.571
Please,
please don't fight them, Ray.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.690
- Get him to his cell now.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!

34:34.739 --> 34:35.694
Ray, don't!
Don't-- don't fight them!

34:35.740 --> 34:37.150
- Just go with them!
- I'll kill you!

34:37.200 --> 34:39.065
Please, his son is
just right outside the door.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.781
Please don't do this!
Please don't do this!

34:41.830 --> 34:44.321
He can hear you.
Adrian-- Adrian can hear you.

34:44.374 --> 34:45.910
- I'll kill you!
- Please don't do this.

34:45.959 --> 34:48.075
- His son is right outside.
- I'll kill all of you!

34:48.128 --> 34:50.710
- Please don't do this.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

34:50.755 --> 34:53.246
- Ray, listen to me. He can hear you.
- I-I'll kill you!

34:53.300 --> 34:56.383
He can hear you.
Adrian can hear you.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.215
You never should've
brought him here.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.754
Think about the trees
outside your window.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.468
They're there. They're there.
They're always there.

35:02.517 --> 35:03.552
All you have to do is look.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.308
Just look outside
your window, Ray.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.303
Look outside your window.
You'll see them.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.687
Look outside your window, Ray.
You'll see them.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.352
Get your hands off me!

35:16.906 --> 35:18.862
I will talk
to the District Attorney myself.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.694
- Linden.
- It's wrong, and you know it.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.235
You can't keep him from--
from seeing his own child!

35:23.246 --> 35:24.577
Hey, keep it down, Linden.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.454
I don't care what
the regulations are!

35:26.499 --> 35:28.956
He's been waiting to see him
all day! You can't do this!

35:29.002 --> 35:30.208
What are you--
what are you doing?

35:30.253 --> 35:31.083
It's over.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.247
What?

35:34.966 --> 35:36.467
It's over.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.886
He...

36:19.719 --> 36:22.461
Let's go, Seward.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.425
Move. Come on.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.487
Come on.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.122
Move it!

36:59.175 --> 37:01.632
Come on. One foot
in front of the other.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.260
Just keep walking.
Come on, one step at time.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.261
You can do it.
Come on, walk with me.

37:06.599 --> 37:09.090
Damn it. Seward.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.718
Get on your feet and quit crying
like a little bitch!

37:11.771 --> 37:13.147
I will put you on that board!

37:13.148 --> 37:14.137
Is that what you want?!

37:14.190 --> 37:15.976
Get up and be a man!

37:16.025 --> 37:17.481
Walk! Walk!

37:33.168 --> 37:35.204
Hold him here.
Hold him.

39:01.631 --> 39:06.216
Let me remind you that
photography is not permitted

39:06.261 --> 39:10.004
and you are required to keep
silent during the procedure.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.756
There will be no entering
or exiting

39:12.809 --> 39:14.424
until it is completed.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.593
Upon a pronouncement of death,

39:16.646 --> 39:18.807
you'll be escorted
back to the waiting area

39:18.857 --> 39:20.188
to collect your belongings.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.434
Ray Seward,

39:24.445 --> 39:26.436
be it known
you have been found guilty

39:26.489 --> 39:28.104
by a jury of your peers

39:28.157 --> 39:30.443
for the crime of murder
in the first degree

39:30.493 --> 39:32.074
of Trisha Ann Seward.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.829
I am hereby authorized
to cause the sentence of death

39:35.874 --> 39:38.490
to be executed upon you
at this time.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.955
Would you like to make
a final statement

39:41.004 --> 39:42.540
at this time, Mr. Seward?

39:46.301 --> 39:49.464
Mr. Seward,
do you have a final statement?

39:52.015 --> 39:55.678
Salisbury steak's not steak.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.434
It's ground beef.

39:59.564 --> 40:02.806
Now, let's get this show
on the road, Warden.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.404
We will now proceed.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.174
Proceed, CO.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.796
No.
