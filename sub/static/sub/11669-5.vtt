00:01.134 --> 00:05.002
How the hell is this supposed to go?
You need, like, seven hands to do this.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.271
Fuck! Ow!

00:07.507 --> 00:10.203
Uh-oh, men, has this ever happened to you?

00:10.276 --> 00:13.211
You're a good guy,
but you're frustrated with your life,

00:13.279 --> 00:16.544
your family,
or a piece of cheap Swedish furniture.

00:16.616 --> 00:17.674
Of course it has!

00:17.751 --> 00:20.447
You're constantly seething
with impotent rage.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.648
Hi, I'm Martin Daniels,
of Martin Daniels Products,

00:23.723 --> 00:25.953
and I'm introducing new Punchables!

00:26.026 --> 00:29.291
It's the first product
ever invented that allows you

00:29.362 --> 00:32.627
to fruitlessly punch a wall
while doing limited damage

00:32.698 --> 00:35.293
to both the wall
and the skeleture of your hand!

00:35.368 --> 00:38.201
Using our unpatented
dish-sponge technology,

00:38.271 --> 00:40.933
<i>Punchables absorb and distribute impact.</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:45.170
- That's salt, Marco.
- Fuck!

00:47.180 --> 00:49.239
Now, that didn't hurt so much, did it?

00:49.416 --> 00:50.644
I mean, it hurt a little.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.651
And get a load of these other
satisfied customer.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.483
My dad never told me
that he was proud of me,

00:55.555 --> 00:57.648
which makes me a moderate anger case.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.089
But I'm also a renter.

00:59.159 --> 01:01.855
With Punchables,
I can vent my endless frustration

01:01.928 --> 01:03.691
and still get my security deposit back.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.788
You mean the security deposit I loaned you.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.423
Why don't you ever tell me you love me?

01:07.500 --> 01:08.797
This is why your mother left.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.062
(SCREAMING)

01:10.937 --> 01:12.268
Thanks, Punchables.

01:12.338 --> 01:15.171
And now for the man on the go,
there's new portable Punchables!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.801
I'm a sales rep, and I travel a lot.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.773
Despite constant temptation,

01:19.846 --> 01:22.280
I can't help but be loyal to my dumb wife,

01:22.348 --> 01:23.713
and it infuriates me.

01:23.783 --> 01:25.182
With portable Punchables,

01:25.251 --> 01:29.244
I'm able to take out my useless
bullshit on any wall anywhere.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.918
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31.991 --> 01:34.255
I was wondering if you wanna
come have a drink in my room?

01:34.327 --> 01:36.625
I can't, but...

01:37.330 --> 01:38.922
Um, maybe some other time?

01:38.998 --> 01:40.966
Yeah, thanks.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.702
Argh!

01:45.371 --> 01:46.497
Thanks, Punchables!

01:46.573 --> 01:49.508
I think you could have banged her
without getting caught, but you're welcome!

01:49.576 --> 01:50.804
Punchables!

01:52.479 --> 01:53.468
Puncha...

01:53.813 --> 01:55.713
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:05.358 --> 02:08.383
Good day to you, sir. How may I help you?

02:08.461 --> 02:11.760
The barber said I have delirium of the bowels,

02:11.831 --> 02:14.299
but the bloodletting's just made it worse.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.999
Well, you've come to the right place, sir.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.506
No need for any more barbaric
or outdated procedures.

02:20.573 --> 02:24.009
Our Chief of Surgery and his team,
they are the best in the nation.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.471
Come right this way.

02:28.414 --> 02:32.043
Dr. Thackery, I have your next patient here.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.218
(CHAIR SQUEAKS)

02:35.288 --> 02:37.722
Then the game is on.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.284
(IN KIDS' VOICES) Junior!

02:47.667 --> 02:50.568
The patient is a 38-year-old man

02:50.637 --> 02:53.197
with an acute infection in his lower bowel.

02:53.273 --> 02:56.436
Untreated, his condition
will quickly deteriorate.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.767
I'll make an incision thusly.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.882
(SNIFFS) Ah.

03:04.684 --> 03:09.121
And then operate using a revolutionary
method of my own design.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.151
Nurse Elkins, scalpel.

03:16.563 --> 03:17.757
(SQUISHING SOUNDS)

03:20.066 --> 03:22.034
- Pulse increasing.
- Scissors.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.607
- Pulse stability dropping!
- We're losing him, Thackery.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.340
Let's hope to God this works.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.613
KID CHICKERING: We've lost his pulse!

03:38.451 --> 03:40.385
- KID GALLINGER: Thackery, it's over.
- No!

03:40.453 --> 03:43.911
- He just needs more glue!
- We've lost him.

03:48.127 --> 03:49.287
Damn it!

03:49.862 --> 03:50.988
(GRUNTS)

03:57.070 --> 03:59.300
You're not supposed to have
those before dinner.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.273
Shut up! I want more Pixy Stix!

04:02.342 --> 04:03.502
(SCREAMING)

04:05.478 --> 04:08.379
Oh, dear. Right this way.

04:08.448 --> 04:12.214
Dr. Thackery, in light of today's events,

04:12.719 --> 04:16.815
the board of directors saw fit
to hire an additional Chief of Surgery.

04:17.223 --> 04:19.885
Like hell! The Knick is mine!

04:19.959 --> 04:22.223
- Dr. Thackery, please.
- Mine!

04:22.295 --> 04:23.387
No, it is mine.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.090
- Mine!
- Mine!

04:25.164 --> 04:27.724
Doctors, Doctors, Doctors!
In this hospital, we share.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.429
We share.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.860
AMY: Is this a bad time?

04:35.241 --> 04:36.538
Hello, John.

(GRUNTS)

04:46.352 --> 04:47.785
Who got your nose?

04:47.854 --> 04:49.719
After we parted ways,

04:50.623 --> 04:53.353
it was ravaged by cooties.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.885
We can sew your face to your arm.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.797
Sew my face to my arm?

05:00.366 --> 05:02.197
- That's the cure?
- Yeah.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.896
Are you looking at my nose?

05:07.573 --> 05:09.006
(SOBBING)

05:09.075 --> 05:11.270
HERMAN BARROW: Right this way, Amy,
already looking good.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.868
- Awesome.
- That is so cool.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.105
Cool.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.943
KID ALGERNON: How did you do that?
Great job.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.185
So that's, that's it? I just...

05:21.788 --> 05:24.586
Stay like this with my face attached
to my arm?

05:24.657 --> 05:26.056
(AGREEING ENTHUSIASTICALLY)

05:26.125 --> 05:28.616
You guys are here 'cause you're,
you're walking me out or...

05:28.695 --> 05:30.162
- Yup.
- Yup.

05:30.229 --> 05:34.893
Oh, and don't pull your... Arm out.
It'II, like, rip it off.

05:35.034 --> 05:38.868
Any sort of home care, I should...
Worry about or...

05:38.938 --> 05:40.098
Nope. Just go.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.435
- All right.
- All right, bye.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.031
- We're gonna keep in touch, right, or...
- Yeah.

05:43.109 --> 05:46.203
- Okay.
- AMY: Oh, you guys, it does not look weird?

05:46.279 --> 05:47.974
ALL: No, no, no.

05:48.581 --> 05:51.482
'Cause it feels weird, I mean, it honestly... Ow!

05:51.718 --> 05:53.185
Ooh...

(SCREAMING)

05:56.322 --> 05:57.789
Ooh.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.991
Be careful! Bye!

06:08.735 --> 06:11.761
- Thanks, girls, for doing this with me.
- Stop.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.363
You know, my sponsor said
in order for me to be sober,

06:14.440 --> 06:16.465
- I have to avoid temptation.
- Good.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.009
KIRSTEN: It's totally our pleasure.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.136
I mean, we don't have
to always meet up at a bar.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.408
Yeah, and we went to one
before we came here anyway.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.143
Yeah, and we're gonna go to one after, so...

06:24.217 --> 06:25.912
- Yeah, definitely.
- It's not a big deal.

- Oh...

- Yeah, are you gettin' some?

06:31.057 --> 06:33.389
Ooh... (MOCKING GAGGING)

06:33.459 --> 06:36.758
I wish, it's my dog walker
telling me I need more baggies.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.690
My phone is dry as fuck.

06:39.832 --> 06:41.299
Are you guys getting any?

06:41.367 --> 06:42.561
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.102
- Nothing.
<i>- Nada.</i>

06:44.170 --> 06:45.762
No, I don't even remember
what a dick looks like.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.773
Are they round?
Are there spikes coming out of them?

06:48.841 --> 06:51.401
Seriously, I haven't gotten laid in forever.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.911
You have no idea, it's like I'm a virgin again.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.811
My hymen has basically grown back.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.873
- Same.
- It's been so long,

06:57.950 --> 07:01.010
it's like I have vaginal atrophy.
Like, check this out.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.352
Ow... Oh, my God.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.856
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- No, I feel nothing.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.825
Oh. Well, you know what,
gymnasts use my pussy

07:07.894 --> 07:11.057
to, like, clap their hands on
before they go on the uneven bars.

07:11.130 --> 07:14.463
I can't even talk about this.
My lady parts look like a wasteland.

07:14.534 --> 07:17.162
- You know, they shot <i>Mad Max</i> down there.
- Oh.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.760
- The original one.
- Oh.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.932
My pussy's, like, at risk of,
like, a forest fire right now.

07:22.008 --> 07:24.101
You can't smoke within 500 yards of it.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.270
Am I, like, even a woman at this point?

07:26.345 --> 07:28.677
It's like a <i>Frasier</i> marathon between my legs.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.215
Oh, stop, seriously?

07:30.283 --> 07:33.275
Like, if my pussy had a voice,
it would sound like Terry Gross

07:33.352 --> 07:36.719
with just a mouthful of crackers.
It'd just be, like...

07:37.990 --> 07:41.084
My pussy is so angry,
it's trolling me on Twitter.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.287
- Oh.
- Some of that stuff's really hurtful.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.887
My pubes left, they just up and left.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.423
Like, they just moved to California
to start a better life.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.800
They didn't even leave a note, they just, like...

07:51.871 --> 07:54.533
- They just bounced.
- I'm so sorry.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.700
Well, I'm having the opposite experience.

07:56.776 --> 08:00.940
My pubes are so overgrown,
my pussy is a <i>Beasts of No Nation.</i>

I just love child soldiers.

So cute.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.079
My asshole's on fire, though.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.749
- Oh, my God, so stretched out.
- Can't even sit down.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.553
My taint looks like a chew toy.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.117

- Do you think this needs more blue?

08:16.662 --> 08:17.686
Hmm...

08:20.833 --> 08:23.393
What was your favorite episode
of <i>Sex and the City?</i>

08:23.469 --> 08:27.462
- I don't have a favorite episode of that.
- They're all your favorite?

08:27.540 --> 08:30.008
- None of 'em.
- Why?

08:30.076 --> 08:32.977
No, because they're just broads,
like, running around

08:33.044 --> 08:35.104
being promiscuous.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.581
You're gonna say that to me and Bridget?

08:37.650 --> 08:39.116
- Hello?
- You're not like them.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.676
You mean, we dress better and we're thinner.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.278
No. And you have personality.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.847
- Yeah, we got personality for weeks!
- Oh, that's right, cheers.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.190
We're gonna have the best time
of our lives today.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.322

- Okay?

- Didn't I tell you, okay?
- Yeah.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.965
You are such a good friend, and I...

08:56.035 --> 08:58.401
You know, this annulment is really
taking a toll on me.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.167
And I'm, I'm just...
I am so glad that you got the tickets.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.266

AMY: We went for a walk, but we are first.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.862
We were here, but we went for a walk.

09:32.171 --> 09:34.366
<i>Are you excited for your</i> Sex and the City

09:34.540 --> 09:36.098

that she didn't want to marry Aiden?

- Definitely!
- GUIDE: <i>Good guess.</i>

09:50.022 --> 09:53.150

but tasteful ceremony.

- Oh, okay.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.556
Oh, I want that for me someday again.

This is a really good tour I bought you.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.896
MELISSA: Oh, oh, my gosh,
is that where Carrie

10:06.973 --> 10:09.533
put on those hoop earrings and that doo rag,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.634
and then she made everybody
feel racially uncomfortable?

10:11.711 --> 10:14.202
Yes! With the hoops, yeah, definitely.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.408
GUIDE: <i>No, these are the courts where</i>
<i>Steve played basketball.</i>

10:19.952 --> 10:21.886
<i>He played basketball, cool.</i>

10:21.954 --> 10:24.252
<i>He also owns a bar, that's cool.</i>

10:24.323 --> 10:26.120
- So cute, I love that.
- Oh, okay.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.285
<i>And let's not forget, he is reliable.</i>

10:28.361 --> 10:31.558
<i>All right, he's short, I'll give you that.</i>
<i>The glasses? Yeah.</i>

10:31.631 --> 10:33.565
<i>But always reliable.</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:37.933
Is that Magnolia Bakery where Carrie told
Miranda about a huge crush

10:38.004 --> 10:41.132
while scarfing down one of that bakery's
signature cupcakes?

10:41.207 --> 10:43.038
- AMY: Definitely.
- Are we gonna get cupcakes?

10:43.109 --> 10:45.737
<i>No, we're not, and nobody look over...</i>
<i>Do not look over there!</i>

10:45.811 --> 10:47.369
<i>That is not part of our tour, okay?</i>

10:47.446 --> 10:49.414
<i>Actually, if you look right over there,</i>

10:49.482 --> 10:53.077
<i>that's the area where Steve was once</i>
<i>carrying groceries in the rain</i>

10:53.152 --> 10:54.517
<i>and the bottom fell out of the bag.</i>

10:54.587 --> 10:57.385
<i>Stuff went everywhere,</i>
<i>it led to a lot of shenanigans.</i>

10:57.456 --> 10:59.651
- (CHUCKLES) That sucks.
- I don't remember that.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.022
I remember that.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.755
<i>It was actually... It was deleted</i>
<i>from the deleted scenes.</i>

11:03.896 --> 11:06.626
Ooh, deleted scenes.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.701
Is this tour just gonna be all about Steve?

11:11.203 --> 11:15.606
Yeah, um, it was, this tour was $6 cheaper,

11:16.142 --> 11:19.270
so, altogether $12 cheaper, so...

11:19.345 --> 11:22.075
But it won't be all about Steve,
you know, right?

11:22.148 --> 11:24.116
- Come on. (CHUCKLES)
- Okay.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.775
WOMAN: Oh, the doctor's office!

11:25.851 --> 11:28.217
This is where Charlotte found out
that she couldn't have kids.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.312
- Definitely!
<i>- Wrong, that was wrong.</i>

11:30.389 --> 11:35.053
<i>This is actually where Miranda's housekeeper</i>
<i>Magda got her bone medicine.</i>

11:35.161 --> 11:37.095
Ooh, Magda!

11:37.196 --> 11:39.562
<i>And then every Tuesday,</i>
<i>Steve would pick her up.</i>

11:39.999 --> 11:42.331
<i>Super solid, classic Steve behavior.</i>

11:42.401 --> 11:45.199
<i>Big would never do that.</i>
<i>Big would never do that!</i>

11:45.271 --> 11:46.568
Big!

11:47.006 --> 11:49.600
See, this is still really heavily about Steve.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.303
<i>Next stop, ladies, grab your panties</i>

11:52.378 --> 11:55.279
<i>because we're gonna see where</i>
<i>Charlotte and her gay friend</i>

11:55.347 --> 11:57.975
<i>- go shopping for blouses!</i>
- (ALL CHEERING)

11:58.050 --> 11:59.312
<i>But before that,</i>

11:59.418 --> 12:03.377
<i>we're gonna see where Samantha</i>
<i>got fucked in the ass!</i>

12:03.656 --> 12:05.089
<i>- Yeah!</i>
- (ALL CHEERING)

12:05.191 --> 12:06.818
<i>I say cosmos, you say anal.</i>

12:06.892 --> 12:07.950
<i>- Cosmos!</i>
- WOMEN: Anal!

12:08.027 --> 12:09.119
<i>- Cosmos!</i>
- Anal!

12:09.195 --> 12:10.253
<i>- Cosmos!</i>
- Anal!

12:10.329 --> 12:11.523
<i>- Cosmos!</i>
- Anal!

12:12.198 --> 12:13.529
This sucks.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.863
We want to see where Samantha
got fucked in the ass, too!

12:17.369 --> 12:18.859
Yeah... Yeah, we do.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.930
<i>Guys! Samantha was a one-note character!</i>

12:22.007 --> 12:25.101
<i>All she did was get fucked all the time!</i>

12:25.177 --> 12:28.772
<i>Steve is the only character</i>
<i>on the show with any layers.</i>

12:28.848 --> 12:31.316
<i>You turn to Steve</i>
<i>when you need some laughs.</i>

12:31.383 --> 12:34.352
<i>You turn to Steve when you need</i>
<i>some pathos, okay?</i>

12:34.420 --> 12:36.115
<i>He owned a bar!</i>

12:36.188 --> 12:38.748
<i>He was a good dad, all right?</i>

12:38.824 --> 12:40.291
<i>He even had cancer!</i>

12:41.260 --> 12:42.852
Samantha got cancer, too.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.427
<i>She knew what she was paying for!</i>

12:46.966 --> 12:48.456
Happy annulment.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.035
Six more dollars.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.133
<i>So, who's ready to visit the home</i>
<i>of Janet Miller.</i>

12:54.206 --> 12:57.437
<i>She's the mother of one of</i>
<i>the four sets of twins</i>

12:57.510 --> 12:59.842
<i>who portrayed Steve's son, Brady Hobbes?</i>

13:00.045 --> 13:02.013
Oh, we are!

13:02.848 --> 13:05.681
AMY: This is fun, and I don't regret it!

13:15.227 --> 13:19.323
Have you ever changed the way
you act around certain guys?

13:19.398 --> 13:22.390
Like, you sort of have to flirt with them
to get what you want out of them?

13:22.468 --> 13:26.564
Look, I never know when someone's
attracted to me. Like, it's really bad.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.300
Like, when do you realize
they're attracted to you?

13:28.374 --> 13:30.399
- Uh, when they're eating me out, but...
- (LAUGHS)

13:36.515 --> 13:39.382
- Should we have sex?
- It's up to you. I definitely want to.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.975
Okay, I can...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.618
Oh, wow, you've got condoms.

13:44.423 --> 13:48.223
Oh, yeah, they're left over from my ex.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.761
Is that weird?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.558
No, it's not like I think you're a virgin
or anything.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.291
(CHUCKLES) No, definitely not.

13:54.533 --> 13:58.435
It's kind of nice not to have to jump through
a bunch of hoops to get you into it.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.164
Kind of.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.970
- Will you excuse me one moment?
- Sure.

14:08.814 --> 14:09.974
Where you going?

14:10.049 --> 14:13.985
I'm just gonna go make sure there's no, like,
stray toilet paper in my pussy.

14:14.553 --> 14:15.986
Oh, cool.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.485
(LINE RINGING)

14:18.724 --> 14:22.660
Greta, I'm about to sleep with this guy and I,
like, really like him. What do I do?

14:22.728 --> 14:25.322
GRETA: <i>First of all, get the toilet paper</i>
<i>out of your pussy.</i>

14:25.397 --> 14:29.026
I know, no, I, I mean, I'm getting mixed
signals in, like, what he wants.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.864
<i>Anal, he wants anal.</i>

14:30.936 --> 14:33.632
No, I mean like the Madonna
or the whore thing.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.104
<i>Just read his vibe. He'll communicate to you.</i>

14:37.276 --> 14:38.436
Okay.

14:40.346 --> 14:43.179
Oh, okay, so, should I not put on this bag?

14:43.249 --> 14:46.343
Um, well, I mean,
I definitely don't have anything.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.010
So, you don't want me to wear this?

14:48.087 --> 14:51.523
Look, okay, this is so embarrassing.
I've never not used a condom.

14:51.957 --> 14:56.018
It might be neat to try without it once.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.623
- Okay, cool.
- All right.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.631
- Are you nervous?
- About what?

15:00.699 --> 15:02.132
That it'll hurt, dummy.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.526
So nervous.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.964
- Oh, well, I'll take it easy on you.
- Please, just...

15:10.075 --> 15:11.508
How long has it been?

15:12.077 --> 15:14.568
Oh... A month?

15:16.015 --> 15:20.543
Uh, uh, a month and six months,
seven months.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.383
- Wow, that's a long time.
- It's so long.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.423
How many guys have you been with?

15:26.091 --> 15:30.050
Two doz... Does that count, two guys?

15:30.129 --> 15:31.892
- Two?
- Like, is that a lot?

15:31.964 --> 15:35.058
Oh, man, I love girls like you.
You're like a diamond in the rug.

15:35.134 --> 15:38.069
When I met you at that after-hours party
for that bartending class,

15:38.137 --> 15:39.798
I kind of thought you were, like, a dirty girl.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.807
- But you're like a little baby sheep.
- Basically.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.365
What do you want, dirty girl?

15:44.877 --> 15:46.071
I don't know...

15:46.645 --> 15:49.614
Well, I want you to fuck me so h...

15:50.549 --> 15:51.982
Softly.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.748
So softly, bunny slopes.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.011
- Okay, yeah.
- Bunny, okay.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.148
- Oh, nice and easy.
- Yeah, okay.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.421
Wait, wait. I wanna look at you.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.086
Will you strip for me?

16:05.764 --> 16:07.356
Yeah... I'm pretty naked already.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.958
You want me to put my clothes back on?

16:10.035 --> 16:11.161
Yeah.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.297
Okay, okay.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.167
(AMY CLEARS THROAT)

16:18.577 --> 16:20.169
Put on the coat, too.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.713
- You want me to put the coat on?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.272
Can you put the hood up?

16:26.485 --> 16:27.577
Oh, yeah.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.025
How are you so good at this?

16:35.127 --> 16:36.924
I'm not, I just...

16:36.996 --> 16:39.863
I mean, I took, like,
a pole dancing class once at crunch.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.297
I'm, like, awkward.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.163
Um.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.237
Um, I don't know what I'm doing.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.932
- Oh-ho.
- Bla.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.168
Oh, come here, you filthy angel.

16:51.443 --> 16:54.674
Get ready for this, you sweet,
innocent whore bag.

16:54.747 --> 16:58.547
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't understand what you want.

16:58.617 --> 17:01.108
- Do you want the Madonna or the whore?
- Yeah.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.679
- Which one?
- Both.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.748
Look, it's not hard to understand.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.951
I need you to be like a sexual
<i>Good Will Hunting.</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:09.493
You've no formal education,

17:09.560 --> 17:11.586
but then you see my dick and you just get it.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.029
Now, I need you to be, like,
a combination of, like,

17:14.098 --> 17:16.499
Hermione from the third movie
and Nicki Minaj.

17:16.568 --> 17:19.969
You're, like, <i>Dora the Explorer,</i>
but your passport's filled to the brim.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.132
Right, you're, like, Maria from
<i>The Sound of Music.</i>

17:22.207 --> 17:25.040
But also the Sex Nazi from <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

17:25.109 --> 17:27.670
Also, would it kill you to do a Boston accent?

17:27.746 --> 17:29.771
(IN BOSTON ACCENT)
I'm gonna get you wicked hard.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.008
Perfect.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.583
Did I cum?

17:37.790 --> 17:38.848
Did you what?

17:47.699 --> 17:50.725
- So, Mary Alice, you are a nun.
- (CHUCKLING) Yes, I am.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.361
- Let's talk about it.
- Okay.

17:52.438 --> 17:56.875
So, uh, do you know,
"How do you solve a problem like Maria"?

17:56.942 --> 18:00.844
In a way, people could say I am like a Maria.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.507
- You are totally like a Maria.
- (LAUGHING) Yeah.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.210
You don't seem, like, how we picture a nun.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.583
Like, you don't, you're not wearing a habit.
Where's your habit?

18:08.654 --> 18:10.451
- Here's my pin.
- Oh, you got a pin?

18:10.522 --> 18:12.353
- Yeah, I got a pin.
- Okay, that checks out. That checks out.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.891
You can come behind the rope.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.723
Um, what called you to...

18:16.795 --> 18:18.592
- This journey, this life?
- Um...

18:18.664 --> 18:21.132
You know, I entered the convent in 1958.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.326
- And, um...
- How old were you?

18:22.401 --> 18:25.370
18, and I wanted to be a do-gooder.

18:25.437 --> 18:29.533
In those days, you became a nurse,
you got married or you were a secretary.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.873
- Yeah.
- Or you became a nun. And I became the nun.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.503
That actually sounds good of that list.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.174
- Yeah, that's right.
- Did you ever date anyone?

18:37.249 --> 18:40.650
Yes, I was engaged to be married
prior to entering.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.311
- When you were 17 or 18?
- And I entered the convent

18:42.387 --> 18:45.083
'cause I knew I could get out of that.
I couldn't get out of the marriage.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.717
- I'm Catholic, you know.
- (LAUGHS) That's right, that's why you went...

18:47.793 --> 18:49.260
Uh, you're great.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.660
I'm gonna take a vow of celibacy, peace.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.857
- Did I understand what it was? No.
- Yeah.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.695
- But did I take it? Yes.
- Yeah.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.531
So, your last relationship with someone
other than God was...

18:58.604 --> 18:59.935
- 18.
- 18.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.838
Now, have I had male friends
in between? Yes.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.967
- Have you made out?
- No.

19:05.043 --> 19:07.671
- You're not even allowed to make out?
- No.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.772
Well, I guess you could
but you might get in trouble

19:09.848 --> 19:11.816
- after you do that, yeah.
- You could get in trouble, right.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.681
Are nuns allowed to have orgasms?

19:13.752 --> 19:15.947
Oh, to masturbate, you mean, uh...

19:16.021 --> 19:18.615
- lf you're gonna follow the letter of the law...
- Yeah.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.181
And the church guideline,
it would be a no-no.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.454
It would be a no-no.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.325
I'm not gonna go and ask anybody
if they're having one

19:24.396 --> 19:25.624
- or not having them...
- I hear ya.

19:25.697 --> 19:26.789
Or if they're doing it or why.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.093
- That's on them.
- Yeah.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.101
- That's in them.
- Lf it works.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.000
Um, did you ever have doubts?

19:32.070 --> 19:33.731
Have you ever thought about leaving?

19:33.805 --> 19:35.238
- Yes, often.
- How often?

19:35.340 --> 19:38.002
- When I was in my 30s, it was very hard.
- Why?

19:38.076 --> 19:39.668
You know, you didn't know
if you wanted to jump into bed

19:39.745 --> 19:42.111
with the next person that came along or, uh...

19:42.181 --> 19:44.411
You're singing my song, sister. Mmm-hmm.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.610
Coming or going or being a parent.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.882
But I don't know a lot of people
that can follow their dreams.

19:49.955 --> 19:53.789
I don't know a lot of people
that aren't worried about their 401 k.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.555
- Yeah.
- And they're the gifts that I have.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.927
Hearing you explain that
does make a lot of sense.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.659
- And I would've never thought of it that way.
- Yeah.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.099
Um, you seem like you'd be
really hard to shock,

20:04.169 --> 20:06.399
and I'm definitely not gonna try, but do you...

20:06.471 --> 20:08.962
- When you're around, like, we're in a bar.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.838
When you're around family or friends,

20:10.909 --> 20:14.208
and they're drinking or maybe smoking pot
or something,

20:14.279 --> 20:16.247
how do you feel being near that?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.916
- Well, fine.
- (LAUGHING)

20:19.985 --> 20:21.919
It's a party, I'm Irish.

20:21.987 --> 20:24.080
Oh. (LAUGHING)

20:24.156 --> 20:27.387
- We have family members that own bars.
- Right.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.086
But you're not gonna be
on anyone's shoulders

20:29.161 --> 20:30.355
at the St. Patty's Day parade in Times Square.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.657
- No, right, yeah.
- Right.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.129
What is something you would
want people to know

20:33.198 --> 20:34.825
about nuns that they don't?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.299
- That we're real.
- Yeah.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.700
I don't think we're any different
than anybody else.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.237
- Yeah.
- We have warts like everybody else.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.170
Right, but not the kind that I got in college.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.210
- (LAUGHING) No.
- You missed out, girl.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.608
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:49.047 --> 20:52.312
AMY: And could you do one more when you
say, "My taint looks like a chew toy"?

20:52.384 --> 20:53.976
(LAUGHING)

20:55.254 --> 20:56.619
- Right?
- WOMAN: Solid.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.349
AMY: Ugh. My...

20:58.423 --> 21:00.687
- Amy, wait.
- (LAUGHING)

21:00.859 --> 21:02.224
WOMAN: <i>So easy.</i>

21:02.294 --> 21:03.522
MAN: <i>Mmm, magic.</i>

21:06.231 --> 21:08.995
<i>Mr. Big! Where are you, Mr. Big!</i>

21:09.067 --> 21:11.763
(WHOOPING AND CHEERING)

21:11.870 --> 21:13.098
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

21:13.171 --> 21:15.332
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:17.142 --> 21:18.302
Oh!

21:18.377 --> 21:21.175
<i>It's like he heard me. It's like he heard me.</i>
