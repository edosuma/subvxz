WEBVTT

00:04.383 --> 00:06.214
- Hey, what up, C?
- Hey, Will.

00:08.554 --> 00:11.250
Bacon, avocado, and mayonnaise.

00:12.591 --> 00:16.322
Alex, the question is, "What are three
things found in Uncle Phil's beard?"

00:17.963 --> 00:21.797
Yuck! Now, I lost my appetite.
Thanks a lot, Will.

00:21.867 --> 00:23.596
No, thank you, man.

00:26.371 --> 00:29.499
Master William, here are the maps
you requested for your road trip.

00:29.575 --> 00:31.008
Thanks a lot, G.

00:31.710 --> 00:33.473
University of Nevada.

00:33.579 --> 00:34.773
Where at graduation...

00:34.846 --> 00:38.646
they don't wear their tassels on their caps,
if you know what I'm saying.

00:38.717 --> 00:40.548
Y ou sure are lucky, Will.

00:40.619 --> 00:44.453
Spending the weekend at
a college campus with 4,000 hot coeds...

00:44.556 --> 00:47.024
and you get to bunk
with Dad and Sara Lee.

00:53.865 --> 00:55.230
Crocket anyone?

01:02.975 --> 01:04.408
Jazz, you all right, man?

01:04.476 --> 01:08.742
Y ou got a kind of a Clark Kent-Urkel thing
jumping all over you.

01:10.616 --> 01:12.447
Actually, Will, he looks like me.

01:12.517 --> 01:14.781
Well, yeah, that's what I was saying.

01:15.587 --> 01:19.045
I'm all ready for my trip to college.
About time, too.

01:19.358 --> 01:21.849
I spent eight years in high school.

01:23.462 --> 01:26.727
Jazz, Uncle Phil
is going to be my chaperon...

01:26.798 --> 01:29.426
and I don't think
he wants you to come, buddy.

01:30.135 --> 01:33.002
Well, I guess I better return
these stupid, funky clothes.

01:35.874 --> 01:37.364
Here, Carlton.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074

02:52.050 --> 02:53.984
- Hello, Master William.
- Hey, what's up, G?

02:54.052 --> 02:55.246
Hey, check it out.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.584
I just finished making my schedule
for the weekend.

02:57.656 --> 03:01.217
Figure if I work fast, I can see everything
that this college has to offer.

03:01.293 --> 03:03.523
This is a list of sororities.

03:04.162 --> 03:07.393
Yes, sir, from alpha to gamma
to bad Mama-Jamma.

03:10.502 --> 03:11.594
Silly me.

03:11.670 --> 03:15.834
When I went to university,
I actually spent most of my time studying.

03:16.308 --> 03:18.799
Well, yeah, but look at you now, G.

03:20.512 --> 03:21.740
TouchÃ©.

03:22.581 --> 03:26.017
Did you by any chance see
<i>Murder, She Wrote</i> last week?

03:26.618 --> 03:28.176
- No.
- Good.

03:28.687 --> 03:30.279
Watch your back.

03:32.157 --> 03:35.024
- I just love having a little brother.
- Me, too.

03:35.093 --> 03:38.790
Isn't it cute the way he burps
and drools and dribbles?

03:40.031 --> 03:41.521
Look, you guys, Carlton's 18 now.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.763
I don't think we should continue
to encourage that type of behavior.

03:44.836 --> 03:46.929
We're talking about the new baby.

03:47.005 --> 03:50.031
I never thought I'd actually enjoy
taking care of one.

03:52.377 --> 03:54.277
It's for you, Geoffrey.

03:54.546 --> 03:55.945
We better get to the club.

03:57.215 --> 04:00.776
All right, but I draw the line
at breastfeeding.

04:05.924 --> 04:09.621
Hey, Uncle Phil, you ready to burn
some rubber, make some tracks?

04:11.496 --> 04:13.293
- Cough up a lung?
- No.

04:13.932 --> 04:16.628
It's okay. I'm fine. I never felt better.

04:16.868 --> 04:18.529
Call an ambulance.

04:19.137 --> 04:21.661
Whoa, whoa.
Uncle Phil, man, you can't do this to me.

04:21.740 --> 04:24.038
I've been planning this trip for months.

04:24.109 --> 04:26.009
Hey, I tell you what.
Come on, you can make it.

04:26.077 --> 04:28.545
There's a Dodger dog in it for you.

04:30.382 --> 04:32.782
I'm sorry, Will, I don't think I can make it.

04:32.984 --> 04:35.248
No, no, no. Y es, you can.
Come on, Uncle Phil.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.015
Come on.

04:37.889 --> 04:42.826
Look, Will, you're just going to have to
call the university and cancel, that's all.

04:43.929 --> 04:47.194
Uncle Phil, why can't you trust me
to go by myself?

04:48.466 --> 04:51.026
Because I'm smarter
than the average bear.

04:53.104 --> 04:55.095
All right. Look, Uncle Phil,
if you can't trust me...

04:55.173 --> 04:57.573
I mean, there's got to be somebody
you trust me to go with.

04:57.642 --> 04:59.109
Hey-ho, campers.

05:21.967 --> 05:25.425
Cut it out, Will.
No hijinks while driving, young man.

05:25.637 --> 05:28.367
And fasten that seatbelt. It's the law.

05:29.274 --> 05:31.071
Yes, sir, Deputy Dawg.

05:38.950 --> 05:42.716
Carlton, did you see that billboard?
Come on, man, I'm starving.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.352
Yes, hello, this is Tony Montana.

05:51.296 --> 05:53.457
I just saw your billboard on the highway.

05:53.531 --> 05:54.828
If you know what's good for you...

05:54.900 --> 05:57.994
you'll make me a pepperoni pizza
with anchovies on it.

05:58.370 --> 06:00.668
Will, what do you think you're doing?

06:00.739 --> 06:02.730
What's it sound like I'm doing?

06:03.375 --> 06:06.970
Yeah, no, we're going north on l-80.

06:07.078 --> 06:08.773
Just look for the little, square-head guy...

06:08.847 --> 06:11.407
who can just barely see
over the steering wheel.

06:11.783 --> 06:13.273
Grow up, Will.

06:17.122 --> 06:18.487
Oh, Carlton, Carlton.

06:18.556 --> 06:22.048
Hey, hey, hey. What's up girls?
Oh, no. Slow down.

06:22.127 --> 06:25.255
We could use a little roadside assistance,
you know?

06:26.197 --> 06:28.688
Will, do you want me
to turn this car around?

06:28.767 --> 06:31.065
I want you to speed up
and catch up with them girls, man.

06:31.136 --> 06:33.570
That's it, mister, you're on a time-out.

06:38.910 --> 06:42.346
Carlton, man, look.
Y ou really need to loosen up, man.

06:42.414 --> 06:44.644
Look, we're young and we're single.

06:44.716 --> 06:47.583
One of us is really handsome,
the other one is you.

06:49.254 --> 06:52.883
But, come on, man, we're kids.
It's our job to act like idiots.

06:52.958 --> 06:55.950
That's your job, Will.
I'm here representing Dad.

06:56.027 --> 06:58.018
My job is to ruin your fun.

07:00.098 --> 07:02.896
And you really love your work, don't you?

07:13.611 --> 07:15.238
What's wrong now?

07:16.381 --> 07:18.713
Look, man, I got to go bathroom.

07:20.518 --> 07:25.387
I'm sorry, but the next bathroom break
isn't scheduled for another 33 minutes.

07:26.191 --> 07:30.252
Well, that may be so, but whether
you stop or not, I'm going in one minute.

07:44.175 --> 07:47.303
I don't get a good feeling
about this place, Will.

07:47.512 --> 07:49.537
It's cool. I'll take care of it.

07:49.981 --> 07:51.642
We ain't black.

07:55.286 --> 07:57.186
We just got back from Hawaii.

07:59.557 --> 08:02.549
Look, you have exactly 45 seconds
to get back from the bathroom.

08:02.627 --> 08:04.993
If you're not back, I'm leaving without you.

08:05.063 --> 08:06.963
Carlton, it may take you 45 seconds...

08:07.032 --> 08:10.001
but it takes a fully grown man
a little while longer.

08:10.535 --> 08:13.561
Yeah, well, you just wasted
about 15 seconds, buddy.

08:16.808 --> 08:19.504
- You smell chicken?
- Forget about it, Will.

08:19.577 --> 08:21.943
Rule number 13, no poultry in the car.

08:22.013 --> 08:23.640
Are we there yet?

08:26.384 --> 08:28.579
Will, I think the engine's knocking.

08:29.020 --> 08:31.318
That's not where the engine is, stupid.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.918
Chicken, my brother?

08:40.131 --> 08:42.190
Jazz, how did you get in the trunk?

08:42.634 --> 08:46.297
It was easy. Oh, by the way,
you need a new lock for your garage.

08:47.906 --> 08:50.101
Wow. College.

08:53.111 --> 08:54.908
Just like I imagined it.

08:55.413 --> 08:56.971
Can I help you fellows?

08:57.048 --> 08:59.881
Yeah, I guess you might as well fill her up.

08:59.951 --> 09:04.012
And wash the windows.
And look under the hood for...

09:05.490 --> 09:07.082
you know, hood things.

09:09.394 --> 09:12.886
I don't know how people play these things.
They're so boring.

09:14.732 --> 09:18.293
Hey, touch that handle, Granny,
and you'll be pulling back a nub.

09:22.607 --> 09:25.132
Hey, Homer.
What's up with the Benz, man?

09:25.210 --> 09:28.577
Well, considering my limited experience
with foreign cars...

09:28.646 --> 09:31.638
this being the first one
anyone's actually let me touch...

09:31.716 --> 09:33.911
I think it went pretty well.

09:34.486 --> 09:38.445
Let me guess. Y ou have a nuclear reactor
in your backyard, don't you?

09:39.357 --> 09:40.824
What do we owe you?

09:41.292 --> 09:44.455
It's $300. There's $25 for the gas...

09:44.562 --> 09:49.056
and $275 to call Germany to find out
whether it took regular or unleaded.

09:51.102 --> 09:52.967
Yo, man, are you crazy?

09:53.037 --> 09:56.165
Well, I prefer the term
"emotionally challenged."

09:57.308 --> 09:59.208
And you still owe me $300.

09:59.878 --> 10:03.041
This guy's scaring me.
Let's just pay him and get out of here.

10:03.114 --> 10:05.981
- Do you prefer a check or credit card?
- Cash.

10:06.317 --> 10:09.218
Well, I've only got $40 cash.
You've got to take a credit card.

10:09.287 --> 10:12.279
I mean, everyone takes credit cards.
What kind of hick are you?

10:12.357 --> 10:14.655
The kind that don't take credit cards.

10:15.059 --> 10:18.324
I'm afraid I'm just going to have to
keep the car.

10:20.431 --> 10:22.092
Whoa, whoa. Homer, Homer, Homer.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.101
Chill, check it out, man, look.

10:24.169 --> 10:26.069
I got $30. Jazz, how much you got?

10:26.204 --> 10:29.605
Well, between this soda can
and what I got in my wallet...

10:29.841 --> 10:31.706
I'm good for a nickel.

10:33.011 --> 10:35.275
Look, Homer, check it out.
We'll get you your money, man.

10:35.346 --> 10:36.643
We just need a few minutes, all right?

10:36.714 --> 10:37.772
All right, it's no problem.

10:37.849 --> 10:41.683
If you need me, I'll be at McDonald's
watching the numbers change.

10:45.223 --> 10:47.350
Great, what are we going to do now?

10:51.529 --> 10:54.327
All right, all right.
Look, let's just think, man.

10:54.566 --> 10:58.093
I'm sure we can come up with something
if we just put our heads together.

10:58.169 --> 10:59.534
You got me.

11:00.972 --> 11:03.133
Yes, yes, yes!

11:03.441 --> 11:05.238
Come to Lola.

11:05.643 --> 11:06.871
Coming.

11:08.313 --> 11:10.543
All right, check it out.
We going to get paid right here.

11:10.615 --> 11:12.845
- Carlton, give me your money.
- Forget it, Will.

11:12.917 --> 11:15.511
I will not let you succumb
to the base pleasures of gambling.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.384
Besides, we're underage.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.184
Can I get $40 in quarters?

11:21.092 --> 11:23.788
What do you say, Jazz?
Y ou turn my $30 into $300?

11:24.329 --> 11:26.354
Does James Brown use a hot comb?

11:36.908 --> 11:39.001
Jazz, that was our last chip, man.

11:39.077 --> 11:42.444
Don't worry, man.
We got her right where we want her.

11:46.017 --> 11:47.382
Full house.

11:48.686 --> 11:49.812
Y es!

11:51.055 --> 11:52.682
Jazz, you lost all our money, man.

11:52.757 --> 11:54.816
I thought you said
you knew how to play poker.

11:54.892 --> 11:57.417
Poker? Y ou mean this isn't Go Fish?

12:03.234 --> 12:05.828
Tough luck, boys. Next victim?

12:07.438 --> 12:09.804
Hey, Lola, Lola, baby. Check it out.
Looky here.

12:09.874 --> 12:12.069
I thought we had an understanding,
you know?

12:12.143 --> 12:14.270
I mean, where I come from,
when a man is nice to you...

12:14.345 --> 12:15.744
you don't take all his money.

12:15.813 --> 12:18.304
I mean, at least not while he's still awake.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.847
You're breaking my heart. Take a hike.

12:21.552 --> 12:25.113
Lola, baby, come on. I mean, you got to
give me a chance to win my money back.

12:25.189 --> 12:28.488
I mean, 'cause if you don't, then
I'm not going to be able to get my car.

12:28.559 --> 12:30.026
Come on, baby, have a heart.

12:30.094 --> 12:33.222
I'm just a poor black man
trying to get to a panty raid.

12:34.599 --> 12:37.693
All right, look, I'll give you a job.
You can work off your debts.

12:37.769 --> 12:39.396
Like Woodrow here.

12:39.470 --> 12:43.497
Y eah, my Studebaker broke down
way back in '78.

12:44.342 --> 12:47.607
I've been working here all this time
to pay it off.

12:48.012 --> 12:52.642
Fifteen more years
and you can just eat my dust.

12:56.287 --> 12:59.051
Check it out. Look, Lola...

12:59.324 --> 13:02.122
I don't want to die here
an old white man, okay?

13:02.794 --> 13:04.421
- Will.
- What?

13:04.829 --> 13:06.296
- What?
- Come here.

13:06.531 --> 13:07.828
<i>E</i> xcuse me.

13:08.633 --> 13:09.622
What?

13:09.701 --> 13:12.670
I think I got the answer to our problem
right here in my sock.

13:12.737 --> 13:16.400
Jazz, ain't nobody going to pay no money
to see your sixth toe.

13:16.874 --> 13:18.671
Allow me, my brother.

13:20.211 --> 13:22.111
Yo, you've been holding out on me.

13:22.313 --> 13:25.111
I'm sorry. <i>E</i> mergency bean-pot fund.

13:25.883 --> 13:29.046
Miss Lola, can I interest you
in a game of chance?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.610
I'm listening.

13:33.758 --> 13:38.320
Okay. I'm thinking of a number
between one and ten.

13:39.097 --> 13:40.587
- What is it?
- Four.

13:40.665 --> 13:41.825
Damn!

13:44.268 --> 13:46.065
You boys are pathetic.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.808
All right, I'm going to give you
another shot, slim.

13:51.876 --> 13:54.310
Double or nothing, high card wins.

13:54.445 --> 13:56.174
All right, you're on.

14:00.818 --> 14:04.117
Black queen. Something I can relate to.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.163
Scaboom!

14:17.635 --> 14:20.536
A black king, and I don't mean Shaka Zulu.

14:25.576 --> 14:26.838
Thank you.

14:29.547 --> 14:32.607
Quarters. I have to have quarters, Will.

14:32.683 --> 14:34.617
- Carlton, wait.
- See, I know I can beat it.

14:34.685 --> 14:37.620
- Carlton, listen...
- First, it was bell, bell, cherry.

14:37.688 --> 14:39.986
- Right.
- And then cherry, lemon, lemon.

14:40.057 --> 14:42.958
- Carlton...
- But now, it's just cherry, cherry, bell.

14:43.027 --> 14:45.018
Cherry, cherry, bell.

14:45.096 --> 14:47.997
Cherry, cherry, bell!
<i>E</i> very time a cherry, cherry, bell!

14:48.065 --> 14:49.327
Carlton!

14:50.968 --> 14:52.993
Get a grip on yourself, man.

14:53.070 --> 14:55.470
Look, I got the money for the car.
We can leave. Come on.

14:55.540 --> 14:56.734
No, I can't.

14:57.108 --> 15:00.236
It's this damn thing.

15:00.511 --> 15:02.604
It just sits there taunting me.

15:04.248 --> 15:05.909
"What's wrong, Carlton?"

15:06.751 --> 15:08.651
"Lost your nerve, sissy boy?"

15:09.987 --> 15:12.182
Look, you got to help me, Will.
Make it stop.

15:12.256 --> 15:14.520
- Carlton...
- Okay, everybody, stand back.

15:14.592 --> 15:17.993
If I apply the Vulcan death grip,
and press real hard right here...

15:18.062 --> 15:19.996
I believe I can make him black out.

15:20.064 --> 15:21.258
Jazz.

15:21.899 --> 15:25.357
Look, look, Carlton.
Listen, if you get in the car right now...

15:25.436 --> 15:28.337
I promise we can sing the theme
to <i>West Side Story,</i> okay?

15:28.406 --> 15:29.998
You can be Maria.

15:30.541 --> 15:32.771
I just want to play a few more times.

15:32.844 --> 15:36.143
Boy, did you hear what I said?
Get your butt in that car right now.

15:36.214 --> 15:38.205
Don't you roll your eyes at me.

15:39.016 --> 15:41.814
I can't leave now, Will.
See, I figured the odds.

15:41.886 --> 15:45.720
If I just play 9,063 more times,
I know I can beat it.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.781
Wait, Carlton, Carlton, listen.

15:49.126 --> 15:51.959
This is what gambling does to you,
all right?

15:52.563 --> 15:55.054
It's a disease and it's evil.

15:56.267 --> 15:57.427
Stop it.

15:58.169 --> 15:59.500
Right now.

16:02.473 --> 16:04.134
Buzz off, flattop.

16:05.209 --> 16:07.541
Hey, Carlton, I ain't playing with you, man.

16:07.612 --> 16:11.514
- Get your butt in that car right now!
- Why don't you just get off my damn back?

16:17.188 --> 16:18.985
Okay, see, now it's on.

16:19.991 --> 16:22.755
All right, see, my mother
don't talk to me like that.

16:22.827 --> 16:24.488
Come on, Jazz, let's go.

16:25.696 --> 16:28.597
I mean, Jazz, we was right
for leaving Carlton, right?

16:28.666 --> 16:29.655
Absolutely.

16:29.734 --> 16:32.464
I mean, I've been looking forward
to this weekend for a long time.

16:32.537 --> 16:34.630
And there ain't no way
that I should miss out on it...

16:34.705 --> 16:37.037
just cause he got the hots for the slots.

16:37.308 --> 16:39.674
You on a roll with a side of slaw.

16:40.611 --> 16:43.079
I mean, what?
He expect us to babysit him...

16:43.147 --> 16:44.944
while he have a nervous breakdown?

16:45.016 --> 16:46.677
He's so selfish, man.

16:46.751 --> 16:48.912
That boy put the "<i>E</i>" in ignorant.

16:53.791 --> 16:58.319
I'm just saying, look, it ain't no way
I'm letting Carlton ruin this weekend.

16:58.429 --> 17:00.021
Are we slowing down?

17:00.097 --> 17:04.363
I mean, nothing, but nothing, should stand
between a man and his Phi Beta booty.

17:05.403 --> 17:08.964
Will, you're only doing 20
over the speed limit. What's wrong?

17:09.574 --> 17:12.542
Look, didn't I say nothing's wrong, man?

17:14.011 --> 17:17.310
<i>E</i> xcept the fact that I got a tank full of gas,
a campus full of honeys...

17:17.381 --> 17:21.249
and all I keep thinking about is
that little midget we left back there.

17:21.419 --> 17:25.116
Will, honestly, I don't think
Ashley wanted to come along.

17:26.691 --> 17:29.751
I'm not talking about Ashley.
I'm talking about Carlton, man.

17:29.827 --> 17:32.591
We left him back there
without a friend in the world.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.091
Then he should feel right at home.

17:37.234 --> 17:39.668
Yeah, you know what,
I think you're right, man.

17:39.837 --> 17:42.135
He don't need us and we don't need him.

17:55.219 --> 17:57.244
Could luck be a lady tonight?

17:59.357 --> 18:00.551
Tramp.

18:03.327 --> 18:05.955
Michael Jackson impression?
Only a quarter.

18:06.831 --> 18:09.766
Here's 50 cents. Now, get out of my face.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.028
Cool.

18:15.373 --> 18:17.500
<i>E</i> vening, Bo. What can I get you?

18:18.075 --> 18:21.875
Shirley Temple.
Hey, no giggling when you bring it to me.

18:28.786 --> 18:31.414
I'll draw your portrait for a quarter.

18:33.124 --> 18:34.250
Yeah!

18:34.725 --> 18:35.749
No!

18:36.994 --> 18:39.326
That's my money.
I've been feeding this machine all night.

18:39.397 --> 18:40.625
Those quarters are mine.

18:40.698 --> 18:42.188
Hey, man, what do you think you're doing?

18:42.266 --> 18:43.631
Get out of my way. This is my money.

18:43.701 --> 18:46.135
- I don't like your attitude.
- Can it, steroid breath.

18:46.203 --> 18:47.727
What did you say?

18:50.675 --> 18:52.540
See? He's doing great.

18:53.844 --> 18:57.109
Come on, Bo, now knock it off.
You might break something.

18:57.548 --> 19:00.381
Yeah, like my cousin. Y o, yo, chill.
What's up? What's up, man?

19:00.451 --> 19:02.783
Bigfoot here stole my quarters.

19:03.287 --> 19:07.485
Carlton, I'm just guessing here,
but name calling? Bad idea.

19:08.025 --> 19:10.619
Hey, man, you tore my shirt.
My mother bought me this shirt.

19:10.695 --> 19:12.686
And you know,
I'm sure she's a really fine woman.

19:12.763 --> 19:13.855
But you got plenty of quarters.

19:13.931 --> 19:16.422
Why don't you go call your mom,
have her send you a new shirt?

19:16.500 --> 19:19.162
I don't want a new shirt.
I want to clean the bar with his face.

19:19.236 --> 19:21.466
I'm saying, my brother,
pick on somebody your own size.

19:21.539 --> 19:23.131
So what are you saying?

19:23.741 --> 19:26.835
Well, I mean,
I wasn't suggesting me specifically.

19:28.345 --> 19:30.575
Bo, now this isn't a fair fight.

19:31.182 --> 19:32.444
Any bets?

19:33.517 --> 19:35.451
I'll take $5 on the big guy.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.611
I'm saying, ain't nobody
going to chump me.

19:37.688 --> 19:39.053
I ain't no punk.

19:39.123 --> 19:41.683
You know, Will, you don't have to...

19:42.326 --> 19:45.727
Look, the time comes
when a man has to take responsibility...

19:45.796 --> 19:47.821
and fight his own battles.

19:51.202 --> 19:53.693
And I'll let you know
when the time comes.

19:54.371 --> 19:56.134
Give me $10 on Bo.

19:56.574 --> 19:59.099
Prince, I know how you can take this dude.

19:59.643 --> 20:01.838
How good are you at faking seizures?

20:02.346 --> 20:04.610
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Jazz.

20:05.349 --> 20:06.839
Look, check it out.

20:07.051 --> 20:09.110
Just take the keys, start the engine.

20:09.186 --> 20:11.654
I'm going to bite him and jump in the car.

20:13.023 --> 20:16.891
Let's get busy. I ain't got all night.
<i>Night/ine</i> is on in two minutes.

20:17.128 --> 20:20.063
Wait a minute. Can I stretch first, please?

20:21.265 --> 20:23.563
Pull a muscle or something out here.

20:34.245 --> 20:36.611
Anybody got any kryptonite in the house?

20:37.481 --> 20:38.914
Yeah, man, that's real funny.

20:38.983 --> 20:41.213
Really? So you're not going to hit me?

20:41.285 --> 20:43.014
You're not that funny.

20:43.621 --> 20:45.612
Well, no, but I can be, though.

20:53.464 --> 20:55.432
- That's funny, though, right?
- No.

20:55.499 --> 20:57.967
Whoa, wait a minute, man.
You wait one damn minute!

21:00.437 --> 21:03.702
We brothers, man. This is crazy.

21:04.175 --> 21:08.043
I mean, we shouldn't be out here
about to fight over a couple quarters.

21:08.646 --> 21:12.241
I mean, in this cruel, hard world...

21:12.516 --> 21:14.677
we got to stick together, man.

21:15.553 --> 21:17.384
Or we done, man.

21:19.356 --> 21:21.347
And if you want to be the brother...

21:21.425 --> 21:25.657
that casts the first stone
for the degradation of the entire race...

21:28.499 --> 21:30.194
then you go right ahead.

21:38.409 --> 21:41.003
Did you get the feeling
back in your head yet?

21:43.247 --> 21:45.306
You say something, Uncle Phil?

21:45.850 --> 21:49.217
Will, I just want to thank you
for standing up for me.

21:50.721 --> 21:53.781
Man, look, it was nothing.
What is family for?

21:54.925 --> 21:57.485
Plus, we shouldn't have left you there
in the first place, man.

21:57.561 --> 21:59.620
Anything could have happened.
I'm sorry about that.

21:59.697 --> 22:03.656
- Are you crazy? I had the time of my life.
- What?

22:03.968 --> 22:06.835
Will, for a little while,
I was living on the edge.

22:06.904 --> 22:10.601
I, Carlton Banks, recording secretary
of the audio visual squad...

22:10.674 --> 22:13.666
was gambling, swearing,
and staying up really, really late.

22:13.744 --> 22:16.838
I mean, I feel so liberated.

22:17.181 --> 22:18.876
Quick, open the back window.

22:19.016 --> 22:21.814
- Yo, for what, man?
- I'm going to moon Nevada.

22:23.654 --> 22:25.053
Bottoms up.

22:26.223 --> 22:29.818
Carlton, come on, put that thing away.
Someone's going to get hurt.

22:30.561 --> 22:33.462
Don't worry, Will. This is my lucky day.

22:38.202 --> 22:41.103
I knew your butt was going to get us
in trouble, man.

22:48.145 --> 22:50.545
University of Nevada, here I come.

22:52.650 --> 22:56.086
Where at graduation...
I got all this... in my mouth. I'm sorry.

23:02.793 --> 23:04.260
Where at graduation...
