15:01.524 --> 15:03.164
Mostly, I was thinking
about racquetball later

15:03.165 --> 15:05.693
and hopefully giving Cam
a nice spanking.

15:05.694 --> 15:07.829
Fair warning... may be
working out some anger issues

15:07.830 --> 15:09.497
on the racquetball
court this morning.

15:09.498 --> 15:10.899
- Don't ask.
- Sounds good.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.767
So, we're getting our
new dryer delivered.

15:12.768 --> 15:14.035
It's supposed to be eggshell,

15:14.036 --> 15:15.870
but, oh, it's not eggshell...
It's white.

15:15.871 --> 15:18.206
Anyway, I'm laying
into the delivery driver,

15:18.207 --> 15:20.675
and Mitchell strolls in
and says, "oh, it's fine,"

15:20.676 --> 15:24.045
and then offers him a piece
of his banana loaf.

15:24.046 --> 15:25.580
I heard that.

15:25.581 --> 15:27.548
Uh, just once, I would like
Mitchell to take my side.

15:27.549 --> 15:29.417
I'm constantly strolling
in and saving him

15:29.418 --> 15:31.352
like a little princess in the tower.

15:31.353 --> 15:33.354
Sometimes I'd like
to be the princess.

15:33.355 --> 15:34.756
- Six of one, right?
- What?

15:34.757 --> 15:36.491
Why are... Why are we stopping?

15:37.598 --> 15:39.799
I'm... I'm very confused, Phillip.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.869
Trust me, this house is
gonna sell at Thorpe speed.

15:42.870 --> 15:44.270
Hey, guys.

15:44.271 --> 15:47.373
Oh, hey, Phil. I guess
you heard. I'm sorry.

15:47.374 --> 15:49.008
Oh, no, it happens all the time.

15:49.009 --> 15:50.943
I just stopped by to give you
guys a little care package

15:50.944 --> 15:52.245
to show you there's
no hard feelings.

15:52.246 --> 15:53.446
Class act, dung beetle.

15:53.447 --> 15:55.181
Here's the malpractice attorney

15:55.182 --> 15:58.050
most of his clients have used
after he's ripped them off.

15:58.051 --> 15:59.418
You will be losing some sleep,

15:59.419 --> 16:01.187
but these have always helped my wife.

16:01.188 --> 16:02.455
And this priest is retired,

16:02.456 --> 16:04.290
but I think he still does exorcisms,

16:04.291 --> 16:05.925
which you'll need after today.

16:05.926 --> 16:07.760
- Listen, Phil...
- It's okay.

16:07.761 --> 16:11.364
It's sad, really, to see
a once-mediocre realtor

16:11.365 --> 16:12.665
reduced to this.

16:12.666 --> 16:14.133
Gil, please, let's keep this civil.

16:14.134 --> 16:16.235
Oh, by the way, if you ever
speak disrespectfully again

16:16.236 --> 16:17.470
about my wife, I'll kill you.

16:17.471 --> 16:19.605
[Chuckling] Sorry.
That sounded like a joke.

16:19.606 --> 16:22.108
I will actually kill you.

16:23.596 --> 16:26.097
Anyhoo, when you guys wake
up and smell the sulfur,

16:26.098 --> 16:27.832
here's a list of other realtors,

16:27.833 --> 16:30.401
and if you need me, I'll be
in the office at 9:00...

16:30.402 --> 16:33.071
Uh, 10:00. I have the dentist.

16:33.072 --> 16:34.839
Where did that come from?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.763
Life's too short to be ruled by fear.

16:36.764 --> 16:39.844
What do you say we get you
the right dryer, princess?

16:39.845 --> 16:41.212
Oh, my.

16:41.213 --> 16:43.314
I mean, Phil is usually just so...

16:43.315 --> 16:45.383
But then he was just, like, so...

16:45.384 --> 16:47.652
And then he got even more...

16:47.653 --> 16:48.686
There's nothing I can do.

16:48.687 --> 16:50.989
- I can't go for that.
- No can do.

16:50.990 --> 16:53.191
Cameron here bought
an eggshell dryer.

16:53.192 --> 16:55.471
Not white, not oatmeal,
not Swiss-coffee,

16:55.472 --> 16:57.228
not baby-powder, not bone.

16:57.229 --> 16:58.930
Eggshell. Look, Rob, is it?

16:58.931 --> 17:00.098
That's interesting.

17:00.099 --> 17:02.300
Here's how this is going down...

17:02.301 --> 17:04.602
We don't leave without
that eggshell dryer.

17:04.603 --> 17:06.771
Not swan-feather,
not Chester-pig-white.

17:06.771 --> 17:08.638
I think we've covered the colors.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.108
I sell houses to people every day

17:10.108 --> 17:12.042
who ask me where they
should buy their dryer.

17:12.044 --> 17:15.378
I don't think you want me
giving them any... static.

17:15.380 --> 17:16.981
I may have one in the back.

17:16.982 --> 17:19.116
But it takes two guys
to load the truck,

17:19.117 --> 17:20.384
and it's just me today.

17:20.385 --> 17:21.714
Is it?

17:21.714 --> 17:25.723
It was right about then that a
question started nagging at me.

17:25.723 --> 17:28.124
[Hall & Oates' "I Can't Go For That" plays]

17:40.691 --> 17:42.657
Is Phil sexy?

17:42.989 --> 17:44.190
[Grunts]

17:44.191 --> 17:45.658
Hey.

17:45.659 --> 17:47.126
You feel like doing something
a little crazy with me?

17:47.127 --> 17:49.495
- [Cellphone ringing]
- What? No. What? No.

17:49.496 --> 17:50.963
Hey, honey.

17:50.964 --> 17:52.064
Claire: Phil, honey,
how you holding up?

17:52.191 --> 17:53.391
Good.

17:53.392 --> 17:54.726
I'm at the beach... Long story.

17:54.727 --> 17:56.061
I was hoping you wouldn't mind

17:56.062 --> 17:57.696
waiting at the house for Luke's tutor.

17:57.697 --> 17:59.231
Actually, I would mind.
I'd mind quite a bit.

17:59.232 --> 18:00.332
- I'm kind of busy.
- Okay.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.054
Cam, there's something that Claire

18:02.055 --> 18:04.102
would never approve of
that I've always wanted to do.

18:04.103 --> 18:05.770
Always?

18:05.771 --> 18:08.411
We're gonna want to put a
blanket down on that backseat.

18:10.943 --> 18:12.277
This was a huge mistake.

18:12.278 --> 18:15.347
I am jammed in the backseat
with a hairy Peruvian biter.

18:15.348 --> 18:17.916
It's spring break '92 all over again!

18:17.917 --> 18:19.584
Well, speed bump coming up.
Hold the leash taut.

18:19.585 --> 18:20.852
It's supposed to keep her calm.

18:20.853 --> 18:22.387
I got lucky. I don't think
this one's a spitter.

18:22.388 --> 18:23.788
- [Alpaca spits]
- Ohh.

18:23.789 --> 18:25.190
- [Alpaca bleats]
- Uh, I spoke too soon.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.392
You think? That's it. Pull over.

18:27.393 --> 18:29.360
You know, Phil, I wanted
to support you on this.

18:29.361 --> 18:31.763
I'm a firm believer
in livestock in the home,

18:31.764 --> 18:33.264
but you are out of control.

18:33.265 --> 18:35.033
No, I'm in control... More than ever.

18:36.558 --> 18:39.226
And if me getting what I want
inconveniences people a little,

18:39.227 --> 18:40.794
- then so be it.
- [Alpaca bleats]

18:40.795 --> 18:42.896
Oh. Uh, she's nervous.

18:42.897 --> 18:44.398
The guy said you should let
her suck on your hair.

18:44.566 --> 18:45.223
Okay, that is it. I am done.

18:45.438 --> 18:47.806
♪ Enough of this ridiculousness ♪

18:47.807 --> 18:49.107
And thank you, Phil,

18:49.108 --> 18:51.410
for making me appreciate Mitchell.

18:51.411 --> 18:52.878
He may have his faults,

18:52.879 --> 18:57.449
but at least he's not a crazy person.

18:58.484 --> 19:00.418
[Alpaca bleats]

19:00.419 --> 19:03.488
Phil, honey.

19:03.489 --> 19:04.756
Yes, Claire.

19:04.757 --> 19:06.871
I got an alpaca... Again.

19:06.872 --> 19:09.160
And there's nothing
you can say about it.

19:09.161 --> 19:11.062
I'm not saying anything.
What's the problem?

19:11.063 --> 19:13.398
[Both screaming]

19:13.399 --> 19:14.899
Mom, dad!

19:14.900 --> 19:16.534
There is a camel in the living room!

19:16.535 --> 19:17.802
It's not a c...

19:17.803 --> 19:19.304
- I-I just can't.
- Okay.

19:19.305 --> 19:21.205
I see you've all met Jolene two.

19:21.206 --> 19:24.275
Sadly, the original Jolene
that your mother made me return

19:24.276 --> 19:26.744
was cruelly adopted
by a children's hospital.

19:26.745 --> 19:29.080
You see, something
hit me this morning

19:29.081 --> 19:31.215
when that truck didn't
hit me this morning...

19:31.216 --> 19:34.852
I have not been in
control of my own life.

19:34.853 --> 19:36.921
But those days are done.

19:36.922 --> 19:38.356
- Oh.
- Haley: Mm.

19:38.357 --> 19:40.691
Huh.

19:40.692 --> 19:42.960
Well, I guess I'm not in
control of everything, am I?

19:45.110 --> 19:45.657
[Chuckles] Funny, isn't it?

19:46.097 --> 19:48.265
You can try and try,
but in the blink of an eye...

19:48.266 --> 19:50.200
[Breathing shakily]

19:50.201 --> 19:53.270
[Voice breaking] You can lose
everything that matters to you.

19:53.271 --> 19:56.272
Dad, are you okay?

19:56.273 --> 19:58.375
Don't you all see
what's going on here?

19:58.376 --> 20:00.010
Dad really wanted that milk.

20:00.011 --> 20:02.879
I almost lost you guys
today... All of you.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.814
- Aw.
- Just like that.

20:04.815 --> 20:06.049
Aw, daddy.

20:06.050 --> 20:07.484
Oh, honey.

20:07.485 --> 20:09.919
You spent the whole day
trying to control everything,

20:09.920 --> 20:12.422
and I spent the entire
day trying not to,

20:12.423 --> 20:14.457
and neither way worked, did it?

20:14.458 --> 20:15.758
Nope. [Sighs]

20:15.759 --> 20:17.994
I may fight you on this,
but I'm gonna need you

20:17.995 --> 20:19.762
to make me get rid
of Jolene two.

20:19.763 --> 20:21.664
- She's a biter.
- [Chuckling] I know.

20:21.665 --> 20:24.701
As soon as we're done with this hug.

20:24.702 --> 20:27.503
Hey, whatever this is,
I need to get in on it.

20:27.504 --> 20:28.771
I almost died today.

20:28.772 --> 20:30.607
- Grandpa.
- Daddy.

20:30.608 --> 20:33.009
- Aw, dad.
- Hey.

20:33.010 --> 20:34.344
Come here.

20:34.345 --> 20:36.385
- Aww.
- Come here, you.

Learn how to drive, lady!

20:45.132 --> 20:46.633
[Panting]

20:46.634 --> 20:48.401
I will get to the meeting
when I get there.

20:48.402 --> 20:49.802
I looked death in the face today.

20:49.803 --> 20:52.939
Hel... hello. Yes, I would like
to leave a message.

20:52.940 --> 20:55.475
My husband ordered
an eggshell dryer...

20:55.476 --> 20:59.011
Not talc, not parchment... Eggshell.

20:59.012 --> 21:02.048
Hey, you're home early.
What happened to you?

21:02.049 --> 21:02.882
Doesn't matter.

21:02.883 --> 21:04.453
So, I called that appliance store,

21:04.454 --> 21:06.826
and I demanded that you get
the dryer that you wanted.

21:06.827 --> 21:09.096
Oh, well, it must've worked

21:09.097 --> 21:11.699
because they're taking away
the wrong one right now.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.067
Anything for you, princess.

21:13.068 --> 21:15.602
Ooh! Who's this guy?
Get over here, sexy.

21:15.603 --> 21:17.104
[Chuckles] If you want
to see sexy, I just...

21:17.105 --> 21:18.939
- Ooh.
- Ah-choo!

21:18.940 --> 21:20.240
Ah-choo!

21:20.241 --> 21:21.942
Oh, d... what is all over you?

21:21.943 --> 21:22.872
- Well, now <i>you</i> are.
