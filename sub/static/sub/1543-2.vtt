WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:05.713
- Where is Crowley?
- I don't know!

00:05.906 --> 00:06.976
Where's my brother?!

00:07.174 --> 00:09.085
Cass, I think I might have found something.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.550
Actually, you need to be worrying
about yourself.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.383
- I'm fine.
- You're dying.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.888
You need more grace.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.652
- And Metatron?
- In jail.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.557
You're a good soldier, Hannah.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.756
Your brother is very much alive,
courtesy of the mark.

00:22.256 --> 00:26.033
- The mark needs to be sated.
- Otherwise I turn into a demon.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.005
You can't stand that he's my best friend.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.104
Together we create the perfect hell.

00:32.432 --> 00:35.845
I'm going to find you.
I'm going to save my brother.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.344
Need some help?

00:40.107 --> 00:42.519
I wouldn't do that. He's a monster.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.847
Is he dead?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.718
You show up where I tell you,
your brother'll be just fine.

00:46.914 --> 00:51.260
Told him to let me go, whatever jam
he's in new, that is his problem.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.202
No! Please. Please, don't!

01:31.491 --> 01:32.834
Dad?

01:37.931 --> 01:40.502
Dad? Dad!

01:43.136 --> 01:44.479
Daddy.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.691
That was the night
that Dean Winchester murdered my father.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.471
And that's...

02:06.660 --> 02:08.502
That's why he's gonna die.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.003
I'm sorry.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.812
I'm not looking for your sympathy, Sammy.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.679
I'm looking for your brother.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.720
So why don't you tell me where Dean-0 is,
and, well, I'll let you go.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.156
- That's not gonna happen.
- Really?

02:28.348 --> 02:32.353
You know your brother gave me the green
light to put one between your eyes, right?

02:33.520 --> 02:34.999
Dean...

02:35.989 --> 02:38.799
- Dean isn't Dean right now.
- Hmm.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.495
- Now, look, I don't know who you are...
- Name's Cole.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.371
Listen, Sam.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.072
Every night...

02:51.905 --> 02:56.081
...since I was 13 years old,
every night I'd close my eyes...

02:58.011 --> 03:00.252
...and all I could see is your brother...

03:01.715 --> 03:03.558
...and all that blood...

03:04.551 --> 03:06.588
...and my daddy.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.564
Now...

03:11.758 --> 03:14.068
...I know Dean's family and all...

03:14.261 --> 03:15.740
...but he gave you up.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.840
And you have no reason to protect him.
None.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.741
So help me, please.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.612
Look, I'm sorry about your dad.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.619
Whatever happened...

03:32.279 --> 03:34.054
...Dean had a reason.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.187
I don't know how to tell you this.

03:37.384 --> 03:41.093
- There are monsters out there.
- You don't think I know that?

03:44.424 --> 03:46.870
I did two tours in Iraq.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.700
Special Ops, Darfur.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.204
The Congo.

03:51.398 --> 03:56.438
I've seen suicide bombers and child soldiers
so hopped up on speed, they could barely talk.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.914
- But they could sure shoot an AK.
- Not that kind of monster.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.745
Don't tell me about monsters!

04:01.942 --> 04:04.821
- Because I've met my share.
- I mean vampires.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.286
All right? Werewolves.

04:07.814 --> 04:10.420
"Monster" monsters.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.088
Look in the bag.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.926
Go on. Well, take a look, it's right there.

04:22.229 --> 04:25.108
Heh. I guess even psychos need to hydrate.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.176
It's Holy Water.

04:27.801 --> 04:28.939
Holy cow.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.277
Look, I'm not a psycho, and I'm not lying.

04:33.473 --> 04:38.286
Well, you see, that's exactly
what a psycho liar would say.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.453
So you see my dilemma?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.852
I guess...

04:44.951 --> 04:48.489
...we're just gonna have to do this
the other way.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.979
She's my cherry pie

05:09.176 --> 05:11.816
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise

05:12.012 --> 05:14.390
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry

05:14.614 --> 05:18.528
Sweet cherry pie, yeah

05:19.286 --> 05:21.197
Wow!

05:22.289 --> 05:23.495
No touching.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.670
House rules.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.666
You sure about that?

05:38.238 --> 05:40.684
Go ahead. Pick it up.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.320
Heh. And we're done.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.047
Hey, hey, hey. Songs not over, sweetheart.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.191
Time to go, jerkwad.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.494
Where's Dean, Sam?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.431
Where is he?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.565
She's my cherry pie

06:01.928 --> 06:03.373
Where is he?!

06:04.898 --> 06:07.037
She's my cherry pie

06:07.234 --> 06:09.942
Put a smile on your face 10 miles wide

06:10.170 --> 06:12.616
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye

06:12.839 --> 06:15.217
Sweet cherry pie

06:15.408 --> 06:19.857
Sweet cherry pie

06:25.886 --> 06:27.559
Huh? Huh?!

06:33.627 --> 06:35.129
Shove it up your ass.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.070
Okay. Okay.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.574
Okay, okay.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.907
I guess it's time
to crank up the volume, then. Huh?

06:48.275 --> 06:50.380
Huh? Huh?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.885
Right there.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.113
Huh?

07:00.954 --> 07:02.934
Ain't you a lucky boy?

07:06.893 --> 07:08.304
Hey, darling.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.005
No, I'm good.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.771
No, everything's fine.
Everything's just fine.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.971
Go ahead, put him on.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.474
Hey.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.654
Hey, big guy, how you doing?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.856
Oh, no, no. Listen, Daddy's
really busy right now, okay?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.460
I love you.

07:31.651 --> 07:35.428
All right, I gotta go, okay?
I'm gonna have to call you back.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.639
- Somebody's there.
- I know, right?

07:45.932 --> 07:47.502
Move, grandpa.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.478
Kids.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.040
Am I right?

07:53.673 --> 07:55.311
In my day, we respected our elders.

07:55.508 --> 07:58.546
Of course, back then,
anyone over 30 was ancient.

07:58.778 --> 08:02.988
Now, 40-year-olds are still living with mommy,
lying on OkCupid and taking pictures...

08:03.183 --> 08:04.787
What do you want, Crowley?

08:05.618 --> 08:06.892
A chat.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.193
We need to talk about
your anger management issues.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.224
Here.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.587
Let me.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.676
Thank you.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.746
Hannah, look, you don't have to...

08:58.338 --> 09:00.875
You can go. You don't owe me anything.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.382
I know.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.857
But I wanna stay and help.

09:09.282 --> 09:13.389
- Is that wrong?
- No. It's just very human.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.958
It's a compliment.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.077
- Sam?
- You need to get to Beulah, North Dakota, now.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.246
- I do?
- Yes, Crowley and Dean were there.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.244
- We gotta pick up their trail.
- Good.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.575
- Great.
- Yeah.

09:31.771 --> 09:32.875
Um...

09:33.073 --> 09:34.609
Not so much.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.415
Cass...

09:37.043 --> 09:38.113
Dean's a demon.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.059
Dean's a demon?

09:43.049 --> 09:44.460
How?

09:45.051 --> 09:47.053
The mark. I guess it...

09:47.253 --> 09:49.130
It just messed him up. I don't know.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.167
That is a vast understatement.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.065
Right. Cass, listen.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.265
I know you're not feeling so hot, but this
is an all-hands-on-deck situation, so...

09:58.465 --> 10:01.469
- So I'll meet you there'
- Yeah.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.621
Are you sure about this?

10:20.453 --> 10:23.297
- If you wanted to stay behind...
- I didn't. I just...

10:26.693 --> 10:31.836
Castiel, I think
the Winchesters are a bad influence on you.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.945
Sam and Dean may be a bit rough
around the edges...

10:35.135 --> 10:37.308
...but they're the best
men I've ever known.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.812
And they're my friends.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.620
I never get tired of looking at them.

10:50.717 --> 10:53.163
All those stars.

11:15.341 --> 11:19.653
Two shots here, he'll have something fancy
with your tiniest umbrella.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.650
So...

11:23.850 --> 11:25.352
...how you been feeling?

11:25.552 --> 11:26.826
On edge?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.660
Pent-up? Unfulfilled?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.560
You sound like a Viagra commercial.

11:32.759 --> 11:36.070
This isn't about little Dean.

11:36.262 --> 11:37.570
It's about the mark.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.209
It changed you.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.704
I've noticed.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.675
I know that you wanna keep the party going.

11:42.869 --> 11:46.840
You wanna have fun, fun, fun
till Daddy takes the black eyes away.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.375
The fact is...

11:49.742 --> 11:51.278
...you need to kill now.

11:51.911 --> 11:56.257
Not want to, not choose to. Need to.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.589
There you go.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.267
Face it, darling.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.234
You're an addict. Death is your drug.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.742
And you're gonna spend the rest
of your life chasing that dragon.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.742
- So?
- So...

12:18.771 --> 12:21.581
I'm here to facilitate.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.450
- You want me to kill for you.
- I want you to kill for us.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.584
Look, you're going to snap eventually.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.820
The anger, the bloodlust.

12:33.052 --> 12:38.263
It's gonna build up in you until you
can't take it anymore, and then...

12:39.459 --> 12:40.938
So the question is...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.972
...do you wanna spike a civilian...

12:44.163 --> 12:46.575
...or someone who has it coming?

12:48.167 --> 12:49.475
Like who?

12:50.970 --> 12:52.472
Like...

12:54.474 --> 12:56.283
...Mindy Morris.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.819
Caring mother.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.090
Loving wife.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.321
Cheating trollop.

13:04.684 --> 13:09.099
After her husband, Lester, discovered
Mindy's liaison amoureuse...

13:09.289 --> 13:10.962
...heated words were exchanged.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.637
In the end, Mindy wanted a divorce...

13:13.826 --> 13:17.103
...and 50 percent of everything.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.676
- But Les...
- Lester would rather give up his soul...

13:20.867 --> 13:22.471
...than half his junk.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.445
We live in a very materialistic world.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.779
Mindy's gonna die, one way or the other.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.182
Why not take the job?

13:31.844 --> 13:33.653
Feed the beast.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.858
Heh.

13:38.184 --> 13:39.663
Fine.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.464
One-time deal.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.870
Oh, there's something else
that I need to share with you.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.678
I'm gonna have to run into town
for a new set of tires.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.181
It could take a while.

14:02.375 --> 14:06.187
You wanna head inside and watch TV,
you're more than welcome.

14:06.379 --> 14:10.225
Oh, and there's leftover three-bean
surprise in the fridge, if you're hungry.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.861
You're very kind.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.155
Mm.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.095
Makes up for me
being an ax murderer and all.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.604
Heh. Sorry, kidding.

14:22.895 --> 14:24.738
Ah. I see.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.905
Thank you for everything.

14:57.363 --> 15:00.537
I understand the three beans, but...

15:01.234 --> 15:03.271
...what's the surprise?

16:13.940 --> 16:15.783
Hey. Hey!

16:15.975 --> 16:17.852
Let me guess. Lester?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.518
I... Who are you?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.350
Who do you think?

16:25.184 --> 16:26.857
Whoa.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.527
- On.
- On.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.827
What the hell are you doing here, man?

16:32.024 --> 16:34.732
Well, my contact?

16:35.194 --> 16:37.538
Yeah, he told me that this was happening...

16:37.730 --> 16:41.473
...so I just wanted to come down
and make sure it gets done right.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.310
Ah. Because you're the expert, huh?

16:46.205 --> 16:49.880
Listen, and this is Murder 101.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.352
When you hire someone to kill your wife...

16:52.545 --> 16:54.752
...you don't wanna be around
when the hit goes down.

16:54.981 --> 16:58.690
- It's called an alibi.
- Yeah, I know what an alibi is.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.558
I watch Franklin <i>&</i> Bash.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.257
Super.

17:04.891 --> 17:09.567
- Listen, you sold your soul for
this crap, so... - it's not crap.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.265
It's my life.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.577
And she flushed it down the toilet.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.913
Les.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.682
I'm gonna say something to you.
I need you to really listen to me.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.910
You're a loser.

17:24.109 --> 17:27.284
Your lady, she's a North Dakota eight,
you're a four and a half, max.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.254
I don't blame her for stepping out.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.525
Especially if she found
you were messing around first.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.222
No. Oh, no. I wasn't...

17:40.593 --> 17:42.732
- How do you know?
- Hm.

17:42.929 --> 17:47.071
Well, you just got that, uh, perv};
I'd-Do-Anything-To-Nail-My-Secretary look.

17:47.266 --> 17:51.442
Oh. No. That...
It's different when guys do it.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.580
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.719
It's called science.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.580
Men aren't built for monogamy.

17:59.779 --> 18:04.421
Because of evolution, we're programmed,
you know, to spread our seed.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.927
Ow. Ow!

18:08.120 --> 18:12.262
Like I said, loser with a capital L,
rhymes with "You suck."

18:12.458 --> 18:15.928
Yeah, well, you're a punk-ass demon.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.937
You work for me now.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.736
So get in there and do your job, you freak!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.849
And what are you gonna do,
you gonna watch? Huh?

18:27.073 --> 18:29.280
Is that what you'd like to do, Lester?

18:29.475 --> 18:31.079
Watch?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.255
Well, watch this.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.003
That's the guy.

18:50.663 --> 18:54.440
I called 911,
but he was gone before they showed up.

18:55.001 --> 18:57.174
That dude get to you too?

18:58.004 --> 19:00.644
Oh, uh, no, this is, uh, just a...

19:00.840 --> 19:01.944
...hunting accident.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.613
- Damn.
- Yeah.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.517
Would you do me a favor?

19:06.712 --> 19:08.385
If you do see him again...

19:08.614 --> 19:10.116
...will you give me a call?

19:11.951 --> 19:14.329
- Yeah, you bet.
- Thanks.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.406
Hello.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.407
- Hi.
- Did you have a good dream?

20:02.601 --> 20:05.605
Well, I, uh...

20:06.238 --> 20:09.082
- I don't really dream.
- Why?

20:09.275 --> 20:12.017
One time I dreamed
that my snot was a rocket...

20:12.211 --> 20:14.020
...and it shot into space...

20:14.213 --> 20:18.559
...and knocked down the stars
to make room for more rockets!

20:19.919 --> 20:22.763
That sounds like some very special snot.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.081
All right, you're good to go.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.771
We appreciate that.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.314
Great guy you have there.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.987
Oh.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.288
We're not...

20:47.480 --> 20:48.550
That.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.456
Too bad.

20:53.552 --> 20:56.294
We have to strategically
calibrate expectations.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.992
And so, by making these 64 small changes...

21:00.893 --> 21:03.271
...I believe we can increase
our demon conversion rate...

21:03.462 --> 21:06.466
...by .03 percent.

21:06.665 --> 21:07.973
Sir?

21:08.768 --> 21:11.305
- Sir?
- Kill me.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.608
Uh, it's Sam Winchester, sir.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.851
He's close.

21:18.744 --> 21:19.916
Dean!

21:22.448 --> 21:25.156
- How'd it go?
- Fine. Fine.

21:25.351 --> 21:26.694
Uh...

21:26.919 --> 21:30.423
- He's dead, and you're right. I feel amazing.
- He?

21:31.991 --> 21:33.766
Uh, Lester.

21:34.693 --> 21:38.266
The client? You killed the client?

21:39.999 --> 21:42.673
Does it marten'? He was a douche.
Now he's a dead douche.

21:42.868 --> 21:46.315
Of course it matters.
The deal was one dead wife for one soul.

21:46.505 --> 21:49.509
The wife's not dead, I don't get the soul.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.515
It's math.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.883
Well, there you go.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.858
Hey! Don't turn your back on me!

22:09.495 --> 22:12.032
Something funny?
- No, sir.

22:14.533 --> 22:15.841
Good.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.849
What do you think you're doing?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.219
Oh, whatever I want.

22:25.411 --> 22:29.018
Really? Because I think
you don't know what you want.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.184
Tell me, Dean.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.829
What are you? A demon?

22:34.353 --> 22:37.698
If so, why isn't Lester's wife dead?

22:37.890 --> 22:39.733
Did you feel sorry for her?

22:40.993 --> 22:42.666
So maybe you're human.

22:42.862 --> 22:47.333
Except you have those pretty black peepers
and you're working alongside me.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.245
Why don't you do us all
a great, big favor...

22:51.437 --> 22:54.111
...and pick a bloody side!

22:55.541 --> 22:57.077
Or what?

23:02.681 --> 23:04.183
Hm?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.794
Go ahead.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.392
Make a move.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.590
See how it ends.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.239
I ain't your bestie,
and I ain't taking orders from you.

23:20.432 --> 23:25.404
When I need to kill, I'll call.
Until then, stay out of my way.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.251
Fine.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.113
It's over.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.784
What can I say?

23:34.446 --> 23:36.119
Crazy ones.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.158
They're good for a fling.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.897
But they're not relationship material.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.467
Are you done?

23:45.658 --> 23:47.262
We're done.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.607
You know what, Dean? Heh.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.469
It's not me.

23:52.998 --> 23:54.238
It's you.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.749
Maybe I should drive?

24:07.346 --> 24:08.518
All right.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.527
Good idea.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.107
Hello, Bullwinkle.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.172
You miss me?

24:30.102 --> 24:31.137
So much...

24:31.337 --> 24:34.045
You're here for Dean.
I'm here to give him to you.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.848
- What?
- Little prat's bad for business.

24:38.043 --> 24:41.024
He's uncontrollable. Must be the mark.

24:42.448 --> 24:46.157
Anyway, Dean's your problem now,
again, forever.

24:46.352 --> 24:50.801
- Then where is he?
- First is the small matter of my finders fee.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.153
Hannah?

25:20.219 --> 25:22.165
She's gone, Castiel.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.857
She took the express elevator upstairs.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.938
To heaven? Why?

25:40.205 --> 25:43.584
Mmm. Hello, beautiful.

25:48.013 --> 25:50.960
- Metatron.
- I knew you'd come back.

25:51.917 --> 25:55.387
That white hot spark between us, I felt it.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.259
I'm here about Castiel.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.370
Ugh. Boo.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.735
After you cast the spell
to close the gates of heaven...

26:05.931 --> 26:08.138
...was there any of his grace left?

26:09.468 --> 26:13.041
- And if there was?
- Then I want it.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.377
Well... Heh.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.052
Everybody wants something.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.725
Question is, are you willing to pay for it?

26:23.315 --> 26:24.885
Are you willing to...

26:25.451 --> 26:27.055
...I don't know...

26:27.719 --> 26:29.221
...let me out'?

26:30.889 --> 26:33.631
Oh, come on. Don't look so shocked.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.931
You knew what I'd ask for.

26:36.128 --> 26:39.234
And you wouldn't have come here
if you weren't willing to pony up.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.746
It doesn't make it any easier.

26:46.505 --> 26:48.109
Fair enough.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.083
So...

26:50.676 --> 26:52.986
...let me sweeten the pot.

26:53.979 --> 26:57.756
I have had time to...

26:58.250 --> 26:59.991
...think...

27:00.185 --> 27:02.756
...and I've decided, screw Earth.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.426
You pop that lock,
I'll give you Castiel's grace...

27:07.626 --> 27:11.164
...and then scamper off to another planet,
another galaxy, even.

27:11.363 --> 27:15.175
And you will never see me again.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.508
And...

27:19.004 --> 27:20.677
...in return...

27:21.306 --> 27:23.718
...you get Cass back at full power.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.623
Large and in charge.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.888
That's what you really want, isn't it?

27:31.850 --> 27:35.798
Somebody big and strong,
telling you what to do.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.967
Poor, little Hannah.

27:39.725 --> 27:42.706
You're so desperate to be dominated.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.379
Watch your mouth.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.978
Like I said...

27:53.172 --> 27:55.709
...white hot spark.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.023
So do we have a deal?

28:02.314 --> 28:03.384
No.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.322
What are you doing?

28:09.555 --> 28:12.161
You know perfectly well
what she's doing, Ass-tiel.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.338
- I had to. You are dying.
- She's right. You totally are.

28:16.528 --> 28:20.237
- You shut up!
- He said your grace, it's still out there.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.003
He's lying. He is a liar.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.011
Hey, words hurt.

28:25.204 --> 28:29.584
Listen to me, Hannah.
You don't want this. I have seen what...

28:29.775 --> 28:33.018
I have made deals borne of desperation...

28:33.212 --> 28:37.683
...and they always end in blood. And tears.
Always.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.863
- So I'm supposed to let you...?
- Yes.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.555
It's my life, and it's my choice.

28:42.754 --> 28:45.064
And I don't want this.

28:47.593 --> 28:48.765
I...

28:52.965 --> 28:54.444
You're right.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.470
I'm sorry.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.323
You're wrong.

29:10.482 --> 29:14.658
I mean, not about the lying part.
I am a terrific liar.

29:15.787 --> 29:17.789
But there is some of your mojo left.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.502
Not a lot...

29:21.493 --> 29:22.995
...but enough.

29:24.663 --> 29:29.669
- And it can be yours for the
low, low price of... - Keep it.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.140
Seriously?

29:35.407 --> 29:37.614
I've made peace with my fate.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.918
Who's the liar now?

29:44.750 --> 29:49.199
I enjoy thinking about
you locked up in here.

29:49.655 --> 29:52.295
Rotting until the end of time.

29:53.258 --> 29:56.000
It's my happy place.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.273
Yeah?

30:00.432 --> 30:03.208
Uh... No.

30:04.369 --> 30:05.507
I'll get out.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.551
It may take a century.

30:09.775 --> 30:13.689
It may take a millennium or two,
but this dump...

30:13.879 --> 30:16.120
...will not hold me forever.

30:17.182 --> 30:18.627
And when I'm free...

30:20.285 --> 30:22.697
...here's a little sneak preview.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.361
Everybody dies.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.731
You...

30:32.898 --> 30:34.206
You talk too much.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.312
Should have killed me
when you had the chance, Castiel.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.646
Dead man walking!

30:40.706 --> 30:42.652
You heard me.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.980
Dead man walking!

31:01.259 --> 31:04.263
What are you, Dean? A demon?

31:05.097 --> 31:06.940
Maybe you're a human.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.777
Pick a bloody side!

31:20.379 --> 31:22.086
Hiya, Sam.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.475
Hey, Harv, why don't you go grab a smoke?

31:47.539 --> 31:48.813
Who winged you?

31:49.975 --> 31:51.318
Does it matter?

31:52.310 --> 31:53.653
Not really.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.082
I told you to let me go.

31:59.050 --> 32:00.996
You know I can't do that.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.065
By the way...

32:04.456 --> 32:05.491
...your, uh...

32:06.158 --> 32:08.399
...pal, Crowley...

32:08.994 --> 32:10.098
...sold you out.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.673
Sounds like him.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.410
Dean...

32:15.600 --> 32:18.171
...hold on a second.
You don't have to do this.

32:18.737 --> 32:21.513
Look, we know how to cure demons.
You remember that?

32:22.007 --> 32:24.578
A little Latin, a lot of blood.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.517
It rings a bell.

32:26.845 --> 32:31.351
Did you ever stop to think that if I wanted
to be cured, I wouldn't have bailed?

32:33.752 --> 32:34.924
That was Crowley.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.528
It really wasn't.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.370
It doesn't matter, all right?

32:43.261 --> 32:46.640
Because whatever went down,
whatever happened...

32:47.199 --> 32:48.542
...we will fix it.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.640
Will we?

32:50.836 --> 32:54.511
Because right now, I'm doing all I
can not to rip your throat out.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.117
With my teeth.

32:57.542 --> 33:01.217
I'm giving you a chance, Sam.
You should take it.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.060
I'm gonna have to pass.

33:06.718 --> 33:10.291
Well, I'm not walking
out that door with you.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.127
I'm just not.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.000
So, what are you gonna do, kill me?

33:18.730 --> 33:20.175
No.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.673
Why?

33:22.868 --> 33:24.677
You don't know what I've done.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.416
I might have it coming.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.745
Well, I don't care.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.692
Because you are my brother.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.660
And I'm here to take you home.

33:41.419 --> 33:42.864
Hm.

33:50.061 --> 33:54.532
Ah! "You're my brother,
and I'm here to take you home."

33:54.733 --> 33:59.273
Yeah, what is this, a Lifetime movie,
huh, with your puppy dog eyes?

34:01.406 --> 34:03.283
Ah, thanks, Sammy, I needed that.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.460
You really think those are gonna work?

34:15.786 --> 34:17.562
There's one way to find out.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.003
Wow, it's really you.

34:58.229 --> 34:59.333
We met?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.266
Talked on the phone.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.071
Right. Right. You're the guy who's
supposed to put a bullet in Sammy's brain.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.411
- Did you miss?
- Well, I had a better idea.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.747
I figure if I let your bro escape...

35:11.943 --> 35:15.322
...he'd go running to you,
and all I had to do was just tag along.

35:15.513 --> 35:19.484
And now, here we are, finally.
Dean Winchester.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.626
Great.

35:21.820 --> 35:22.958
A groupie.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.191
Heh-heh. You remember me?

35:26.358 --> 35:29.271
Yeah. Yeah, you're that
guy from that thing.

35:29.794 --> 35:34.470
- Nyack, New York. June 21st, 2003.
- Is that supposed to ring a bell?

35:34.666 --> 35:37.943
It was the night you murdered a man
by the name of Edward Trenton.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.706
He was my father.

35:41.006 --> 35:42.781
- Okay.
- Okay?

35:42.974 --> 35:46.217
Hey, I'm not saying I didn't slice
and dice your old man.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.856
He wasn't the first
and he certainly wasn't the last.

35:49.047 --> 35:52.392
- They all just kind of get blended up.
- I saw you...

35:52.817 --> 35:54.194
...that night.

35:54.386 --> 35:57.299
After. You let me live.
That was dumb, real dumb.

36:02.027 --> 36:05.474
I spent half my life
training for this moment.

36:05.964 --> 36:09.309
I've played out this fight
a thousand times in my mind.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.815
And I know all about you, Dean-o.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.574
And you're good.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.251
Oh, you're real good.

36:16.474 --> 36:17.680
But you see, I'm better.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.755
Prove it.

36:21.579 --> 36:22.853
Take a shot.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.762
Well, that's no payback.

36:33.658 --> 36:34.830
This is payback.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.388
You know...

36:54.079 --> 36:56.787
...and I'm just spitballing here,
but, uh, maybe...

36:57.282 --> 37:00.786
...you are not as good
as you think you are.

37:02.353 --> 37:03.457
Oh.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.800
You know Kung Fu?

37:06.591 --> 37:07.899
I know everything.

37:09.694 --> 37:10.968
Well, come on.

37:27.812 --> 37:31.419
What did you think was gonna happen, huh?
You just stroll up here...

37:31.616 --> 37:36.122
...say, "My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father. Prepare to die"...

37:36.321 --> 37:38.164
...and I'd just roll over?

37:40.158 --> 37:43.503
Well, that's just... That makes me sad.

37:49.167 --> 37:52.512
You have no idea what you've
walked into here, do you?

37:53.271 --> 37:54.682
None.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.080
What are you?

37:58.343 --> 38:00.016
I'm a demon.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.663
Do it!

38:17.962 --> 38:20.374
You said if you saw me you'd kill me,
so do it!

38:22.967 --> 38:25.880
Well, I guess I changed my mind.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.556
Stop! It's over!

38:37.982 --> 38:40.292
- It's over!
- Argh!

38:48.393 --> 38:50.532
A pleasure doing business.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.742
What are you gonna do with it?

38:55.066 --> 38:59.037
Toss it into a volcano,
leave it on the moon. I'll get creative.

39:00.805 --> 39:06.187
Believe me, I don't want Dean getting his
hands on the precious any more than you do.

39:06.578 --> 39:10.048
Your brother knows I ratted,
tends to hold a grudge.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.921
I don't wanna get...

39:12.417 --> 39:14.021
...boned.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.059
This doesn't make us square.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.874
- If I see you again...
- Stop it, Samantha.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.940
No one likes a tease.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.429
Give me every book you have on demons.

39:53.558 --> 39:58.598
Hey, there, lonely girl

39:58.796 --> 40:02.437
Lonely girl

40:02.634 --> 40:04.614
Let make your...

40:04.802 --> 40:05.940
Sir...

40:06.771 --> 40:08.614
...it's time to move on.

40:09.140 --> 40:13.145
Hey, there, lonely girl

40:13.645 --> 40:16.751
Lonely girl

40:17.582 --> 40:21.496
Won't you make this lonely boy...

40:34.732 --> 40:36.507
This thing's filthy.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.512
It's just a car, Sam.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.848
"It's just a car"?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.249
Wow. Heh.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.785
You really have gone dark.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.192
You have no idea.

40:51.249 --> 40:52.523
You know what, Dean?

40:54.018 --> 40:55.656
I saw what happened back there.

40:56.354 --> 40:58.857
You could have killed that guy
and you didn't.

41:00.024 --> 41:02.026
You took mercy on him.

41:03.027 --> 41:04.631
You call that mercy?

41:05.530 --> 41:10.001
Imagine you spend your whole life hunting
down the guy that knifed your father.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.374
When you finally find him...

41:12.971 --> 41:14.882
...he whips you like a dog.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.851
Heh. How do you think that feels?

41:23.047 --> 41:26.358
That kid's gonna spend his whole life
knowing that he had his shot...

41:26.551 --> 41:28.895
...and that he couldn't beat me.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.497
That ain't mercy.

41:32.557 --> 41:35.231
That's the worst thing
I could have done to him.

41:38.796 --> 41:41.072
And what I'm gonna do to you, Sammy...

41:42.700 --> 41:44.873
...well, that ain't gonna be mercy, either.
