00:22.689 --> 00:25.234
Hey babe.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.526
Almost there.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.277
Keep it up.

00:28.946 --> 00:29.780
You're at the light.

00:29.780 --> 00:30.781
Matthew slow down.

00:30.781 --> 00:31.406
I got it, I got it.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.754
You good?

00:45.754 --> 00:46.463
Okay.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.344
It's been nine months,

00:52.344 --> 00:53.637
I'm just excited
to meet this guy.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.264
Right little mini me?

00:55.264 --> 00:56.723
Excuse me, mini us.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.268
I think I got a little
something to do with this.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.144
My bad, I'm just a
bystander at this point.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.437
I can't imagine.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.987
Do you think I'm gonna
be a good father?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.238
Are you crazy?

01:12.489 --> 01:13.907
I don't know.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.742
You're gonna be amazing.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.453
I wouldn't of married
you otherwise.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.165
I love you so much.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.166
I love you.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.377
Honey the light's green.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.795
Yeah, okay.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.521
Mama.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.856
Hi baby.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.736
You're fine baby.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.489
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.407
What happened?

02:37.407 --> 02:40.202
You're in the hospital.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.119
Wait a minute.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.329
Where's my,

02:42.329 --> 02:43.622

02:43.622 --> 02:45.624
Right over there baby.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.333
Hi.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.418
Hi Allison.

02:54.049 --> 02:54.758
Listen.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.012
Where's Matthew?

03:00.305 --> 03:01.223
Honey...

03:02.891 --> 03:05.644
I'm so sorry Julie.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.896
They did everything
they could sweetheart.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.231
I'm sorry honey.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.817
Mom--

03:11.817 --> 03:13.276
I'm sorry sweetheart, they
did everything they could.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.319
They tried.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.195
No.

03:15.195 --> 03:15.904
Honey.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.364
No.

03:17.364 --> 03:17.948
Sweetheart,
you've gotta stay calm.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.408
No, no!

03:19.408 --> 03:20.826
Honey.
No, no, no!

03:21.827 --> 03:24.746
No, no where is he!

03:24.746 --> 03:25.622
Calm down.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.708
Honey.
Matthew!

03:28.708 --> 03:29.751
You've gotta calm down.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.129
No, Matthew!

04:17.048 --> 04:19.134
You mean that's our house?

04:19.134 --> 04:20.427
It sure is buddy.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.428
What do you think?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.763
I love it.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.390
Oh my goodness, this
is actually happening!

04:25.390 --> 04:26.475
Oh come here buddy.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.184
Oh yeah!

04:29.811 --> 04:31.772
I missed you so much Matty!

04:31.772 --> 04:33.690
Can't do that in a video chat.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.859
Hey, I heard you like Legos.

04:35.859 --> 04:36.610
Yeah.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.444
Yeah?

04:37.444 --> 04:38.653
Yeah!

04:38.653 --> 04:39.488
Okay, go on, let's go inside.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.114
We can unload later.

04:41.114 --> 04:41.490
I have coffee inside.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.407
Okay.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.450
How was the drive?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.618
It was long.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.661
But I got lots of Matty time.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.165
I just cannot believe you guys

04:50.165 --> 04:51.583
are actually here.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.584
Well, in all fairness,
you have been

04:52.584 --> 04:55.253
begging for six years.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.588
No seven actually.

04:56.588 --> 05:00.801
I've been wanting you to
come out since before...

05:00.801 --> 05:02.469
Yeah, it's okay.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.221
Before Matthew died.

05:05.806 --> 05:10.101
Well I'm just so glad
you guys are here now.

05:10.101 --> 05:10.811
Me too.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.439
And I live only
four blocks away.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.649
Definite bonus.

05:17.609 --> 05:21.446
Yeah, I can barely see
Matty just growing up here.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.325
And you?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.494
Yeah, I am ready
to start over.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.703
It's time you know?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.372
Oh yeah, I'll say.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.293
I do however need a job.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.586
You will find one.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.587
You will.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.631
We'll figure it out, together.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.342
You are the best.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.594
Likewise.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.722
Hey Mommy,
look what I made!

05:47.722 --> 05:48.515
Yeah!

05:48.515 --> 05:50.016
Wow!

05:50.016 --> 05:51.643
Are you ready for me
to storm your castle?

05:51.643 --> 05:52.394
No.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.187
I'm gonna get you!

06:25.594 --> 06:26.887
Hey buddy.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.512
There he
goes, look at you.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.597
Thanks.

06:28.597 --> 06:29.931
Good job.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.641
Just stay on
the sidewalk okay?

06:31.641 --> 06:32.559
I am.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.687
You know, a lot of the kids
his age in the neighborhood

06:35.687 --> 06:37.689
don't have training
wheels anymore.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.441
He's getting there.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.442
Oh yeah.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.777
No, of course.

06:42.777 --> 06:43.737
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to overstep.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.530
No, no, you didn't.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.450
It's just, I don't think he
needs to grow up too fast.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.659
One day at a time you know?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.369
Yeah, yeah, of course.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.830
Okay, so where were we?

06:53.830 --> 06:56.207
Well I do need to
find a sitter for Matty.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.876
Oh, that's easy,
Hello Neighbor.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.586
What's that?

06:59.586 --> 07:00.879
T's the greatest
invention in the world.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.922
Mom, mommy, mom, look!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.132
Can I?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.884
Of course you can, go.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.302
Hang on Matt, I've got
my eyes on you though.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.845
Be careful!

07:08.845 --> 07:10.972
So anyways, Hello
Neighbor is the private

07:10.972 --> 07:13.350
social network for
the neighborhood.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.851
Okay yeah, I think
I've heard of this.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.478
Yeah, yeah.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.562
All the local communities have them.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.980
It's kind of addictive.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.607
You can keep up with
all the juicy gossip

07:20.607 --> 07:22.233
between the neighbors,

07:22.233 --> 07:24.444
and it's actually just a
great resource for referrals,

07:24.444 --> 07:26.279
so it's good.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.114
Okay, so you think I can
actually find a sitter there?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.532
Oh yeah, for sure.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.367
They have everything
from street closures,

07:30.367 --> 07:33.453
to yard sales, to job openings.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.081
Oh hey, Randie, Eleanor. This
is my sister窶進n窶人aw Julie.

07:36.081 --> 07:36.831
She just moved here.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.582
Hi Julie.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.042
Hi.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.168
And that
is my nephew Matty.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.045
He will be in Cameron's class.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.963
Oh, so he's going into first?

07:43.963 --> 07:44.798
Yes.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.424
So are the twins.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.552
I'll make sure they
make him feel welcomed.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.429
Oh thank you.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.475
Hi.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.899
Searching nannies, here we go.

08:02.899 --> 08:06.778
User, Julie33, enter.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.699
Hello Marisol, you look like

08:10.699 --> 08:12.659
a lovely nanny candidate.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.082
Hi honey,
can you see me?

08:19.082 --> 08:21.292
I can see half of you.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.919
How about now?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.671
I can see your ear, barely.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.880
What about now?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.674
Just back up two feet Mom.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.675
Okay honey.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.467
How are you?

08:29.467 --> 08:30.802
I miss you.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.679
I miss you too sweetheart.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.888
How are you?

08:33.888 --> 08:35.014
Good.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.725
Great even.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.517
I've got a job interview.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.352
Oh honey,

08:39.352 --> 08:41.312
I'm so glad.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.690
You are such an incredible
physical therapist.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.900
I really miss my
shoulder rubs already.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.485
Well come and visit.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.611
Soon.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.572
You need to settle in.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.700
How's your sister窶進n窶人aw?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.869
You can ask without that
subtle hint of irritation.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.203
Well, I just don't
understand why you

08:57.203 --> 09:00.665
had to move across the
country to be near her.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.959
I told you, I needed
a fresh start Mom.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.753
But honey, you're
so far away from me.

09:04.753 --> 09:05.837
Don't start.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.172
Too late, I'm starting.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.256
I mean you could move here.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.466
It's gorgeous.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.300
Ah!

09:10.300 --> 09:11.384
The suburbs!

09:13.470 --> 09:15.805
I need you to be happy for me.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.182
I am honey.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.725
I'm happy for you.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.478
I just miss you and I love you.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.730
I love you too.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.898
I gotta go.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.608
What was that?

09:26.608 --> 09:27.817
I'm sure it's nothing
Mom, I'll call you later.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.610
Honey.

10:19.119 --> 10:19.828
Okay.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.793
This is an impressive place
you have here I must say.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.419
And I'm excited to start.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.130
Thank you again for the opportunity.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.798
Oh of course.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.759
My top therapist suddenly
decided to stop coming to work.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.137
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear
about your therapist.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.307
Well, I'm just grateful
you called when you did.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.726
Well Julie, welcome aboard.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.103
Well thank you.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.896
See Monday Dr. P.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.524
Blake,
how's your knee?

10:49.524 --> 10:51.609
It's good thanks to you.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.487
Hi, Blake Larson.

10:55.864 --> 10:56.823
Nice to meet ya.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.033
Hi, I'm Julie Caster.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.743
It's my first day.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.996
Oh, well I look forward
to seeing you again.

11:02.996 --> 11:03.705
Me too.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.876
Well it's nice to
meet you Julie Caster.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.460
See you guys later.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.505
I'm excited to start.

11:14.174 --> 11:14.841
Nice!

11:15.884 --> 11:16.926
Oh I'm getting dizzy!

11:16.926 --> 11:17.886
Let's go the other way!

11:17.886 --> 11:18.803
Yeah!

11:20.597 --> 11:22.182
Good job!

11:22.182 --> 11:23.433
Julie Caster?

11:23.433 --> 11:26.352
Hi, hi, oh my gosh,
call me Julie.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.562
You must be Marisol.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.438
You didn't answer the front door

11:28.438 --> 11:29.898
and then I heard the two of you

11:29.898 --> 11:31.524
having a blast
back here so I just

11:31.524 --> 11:32.442
thought I'd--

11:32.442 --> 11:33.902
Yeah no, of course, welcome.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.069
This is Matty.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.446
Matty come.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.740
Hi Matty, I'm Marisol.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.158
Hi.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.410
I emailed you my references.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.537
Oh yeah, I've called them all already.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.164
Sorry, I'm helicopter mom.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.916
But they're all very big fans.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.084
And I helped raise my
three little brothers

11:50.084 --> 11:51.961
so I've had a lot of practice.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.921
Impressive.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.798
Well I just got a job.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.134
I'm working three days
a week from 10 to six.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.886
So I can take Matty to
school in the mornings

11:59.886 --> 12:01.262
but I need someone
to pick him up

12:01.262 --> 12:03.139
and then just be here
with him until I get home.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.390
I'm studying for
LSATs right now

12:04.390 --> 12:05.767
and taking some night classes,

12:05.767 --> 12:07.852
so it actually
works out perfectly.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.270
He's adorable by the way.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.648
I'm not adorable,
I'm tough, see?

12:11.648 --> 12:13.524
Oh my goodness,
you aren't kidding.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.859
I bet you're super fast too huh?

12:14.859 --> 12:15.902
I am!

12:15.902 --> 12:16.861
I bet you can't catch me.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.863
Oh we'll see about that!

12:18.863 --> 12:19.948
Awe.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.742
Okay you're hired!

12:24.911 --> 12:26.621
You're gonna get dizzy!

12:33.461 --> 12:35.588
Okay, three and
a half miles, nice.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.464
Nice.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.257
Good work.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.550
What is that?

12:39.550 --> 12:40.969
Yeah.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.387
That's from the rock fairy.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.346
Seriously?

12:43.346 --> 12:44.514
Yeah.

12:44.514 --> 12:45.598
Well, aka me.

12:46.975 --> 12:47.850
Too cute, okay.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.893
Ha. Yeah

12:48.893 --> 12:49.727
Let's go in.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.687
It is cute.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.647
You are so cute.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.025
Yeah, no, it's a
tradition in Birchwood.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.193
An anonymous neighbor
always leaves it

12:57.193 --> 12:58.945
as a sign of
welcome and support.

12:58.945 --> 12:59.988
That's sweet.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.823
Yeah, less hokey.

13:01.823 --> 13:02.699
I love hokey.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.574
Well then you'll fit right in.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.914
Oh gosh. Well I can
say I have to thank you

13:09.914 --> 13:11.541
then anonymous neighbor.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.294
Okay, well that's a rock.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.337
No, for everything.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.673
I mean I'm happy Ally.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.384
For the first time since,

13:21.384 --> 13:22.802
since I lost him.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.264
So you are just gonna
have to get used

13:26.264 --> 13:28.599
to me being all
emotional and grateful

13:28.599 --> 13:30.310
at how awesome you are.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.105
Well yeah.

13:34.105 --> 13:37.191
When Matthew died I
thought I lost everything.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.610
But it's almost like...

13:41.112 --> 13:43.698
he's alive again in Matty.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.159
You know what I mean?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.869
Very much so.

13:47.869 --> 13:48.828
I feel that.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.794
Well aren't we a pair?

13:56.794 --> 13:57.879
We are.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.848
Almost done Matt attack.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.891
It's a fairy rock.

14:09.891 --> 14:10.975
Really?

14:10.975 --> 14:11.684
Big time.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.560
Hey baby.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.062
Hi Ally, how are you?

14:14.062 --> 14:14.979
Good to see you this morning.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.272
Nice surprise.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.106
Had to get a little Matty time

14:17.106 --> 14:19.150
before I start my day.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.485
Speaking of Matty time,

14:20.485 --> 14:22.820
Marisol's making me cinnamon toast.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.155
Smells yummy.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.990
Well that is your sugar
for the day, okay?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.658
I know Mommy.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.035
I like to keep his sugar intake

14:29.035 --> 14:30.411
to a bare minimum.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.204
Of course.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.914
Thank you.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.248
Ooh, I want some.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.044
Mommy said I can only have one.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.087
Mean mommy.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.047
Mean mommy.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.882
Nice, nice guys.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.051
Okay, I'm running late so
you guys have a good day.

14:45.051 --> 14:45.843
I love you.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.428
Bye, I love you too.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.971
Mommy's right, you probably
should just have one.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.014
I'll help you with that.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.140
Hey, that was mine!

14:51.140 --> 14:52.225
Mm, so good!

14:53.309 --> 14:54.727
Mm, good Marisol.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.693
So, how you liking
Birchwood so far?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.654
It's pretty perfect.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.030
How's that feeling?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.281
It's actually a lot better.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.826
You're a little miracle
worker aren't you?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.828
You are too kind.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.454
I'm gonna go ahead
and jump in head first.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.706
Would it be too soon
for me to ask you out?

15:15.706 --> 15:16.624
On a date?

15:17.667 --> 15:18.584
Huh?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.711
No, on a fishing expedition.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.674
I'm just kidding, I know
nothing about fishing.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.175
And apparently
less about dating.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.552
But I'd like to take
you out for a meal

15:27.552 --> 15:29.011
and coffee on land.

15:30.513 --> 15:33.141
Well,

15:33.141 --> 15:34.475
Before you answer,
just imagine how

15:34.475 --> 15:36.185
awkward it's gonna
be, me coming here

15:36.185 --> 15:38.521
three times a week and you
rejecting me each time.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.481
Yeah, that would
be pretty awkward.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.858
Yeah, I'm stubborn.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.401
I'm gonna keep asking
until you give in.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.944
So you might as well save
yourself a lot of time

15:44.944 --> 15:46.237
and me a lot of embarrassment.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.905
Just say yes.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.741
How about an I'll
think about it?

15:50.741 --> 15:51.951
I'll take it.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.245
Have you thought about it?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.288
Okay, come on.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.922
And with a whoosh of the wand,

16:04.922 --> 16:08.217
she turned the frog
into a handsome prince

16:08.217 --> 16:10.803
and they lived
happily ever after.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.222
I like that one Mama.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.724
Yeah?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.185
What do you like about
that one my sweet boy?

16:17.185 --> 16:19.812
I like the hairy godmother.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.063
You mean the fairy.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.190
She reminded me of Ally.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.025
Awe, that's so nice.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.028
Who did I remind you of?

16:27.028 --> 16:27.862
The frog.

16:27.862 --> 16:28.696
The frog?

16:31.699 --> 16:32.992
Where's Bibbby mom?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.493
I think Bibbby's downstairs.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.119
I'm gonna have to get him
for you in a few minutes.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.329
Promise?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.622
I promise.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.873
May I help you with something?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.791
It's sleep, sleep, sleep time.

16:40.791 --> 16:41.751
Night froggy.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.669
Ha ha, goodnight.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.462
I love you.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.967
Hey wait,
don't I know you?

17:24.919 --> 17:26.087
911.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.214
There's an intruder in my house.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.509
Yes, no, I'm locked
upstairs in my son's room.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.803
I can hear them downstairs.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.013
Hurry please.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.783
It was just me and my son.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.201
And where's your son now?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.369
He's upstairs.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.288
I didn't wanna wake him.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.540
We were together in his
room when it happened.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.583
Got it.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.085
And as far as missing items,

18:06.085 --> 18:07.336
nothing except--

18:07.336 --> 18:08.671
Some cash.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.799
I don't keep that
much around the house.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.344
Oh and Matty's stuffed
bunny that he sleeps with.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.347
He loves that rabbit,
it was his fathers.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.974
Rabbit?

18:19.974 --> 18:23.060
Yeah, it's brown with a
white patch on it's side.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.395
He calls it Bibbby.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.566
Bibbby, is that with two B's?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.944
Actually it's with three.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.576
I'll file the report,
send you the case number.

18:38.576 --> 18:42.246
If you see any suspicious
activity let us know.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.338
I can't believe it.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.464
Well it happened to me.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.466
I know, I know, I'm so sorry.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.383
It's not your fault.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.260
I know.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.721
You know, have you posted
about it on Hello Neighbor?

18:58.721 --> 19:00.139
No.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.557
Why would I--

19:01.557 --> 19:02.850
Well, I mean people
post about anything.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.310
Usually it's that there's
trash in the street

19:04.310 --> 19:05.978
or the trees need trimming.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.356
But this is something people
should actually know about.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.523
You're probably right.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.900
I just, it feels weird that that

19:10.900 --> 19:12.693
would be my first post you know?

19:12.693 --> 19:14.737
Yeah, well, this community

19:14.737 --> 19:16.197
lives in it's own little bubble.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.531
They could use a
good wake up call.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.825
Okay, I'll do that.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.244
I feel like I just need to
recover a little bit first.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.163
Oh yeah, no of course.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.748
It's just really important

19:25.748 --> 19:27.458
that you post it in Hello Neighbor.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.460
Yeah, I will.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.920
What time is it?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.171
I actually have to
go to work today.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.547
It's the weekend.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.174
Well I'm filling in.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.219
Earning some brownie
points with Dr. Pearson.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.387
I'll see ya, gotta go.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.346
Alright, bye.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.538
Hi mom.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.123
I've been so
worried about you.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.666
Oh we're fine.

20:08.666 --> 20:09.583
It was just a break in.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.377
Just a break in?

20:11.377 --> 20:13.254
I thought that neighborhood
was supposed to be safe?

20:13.254 --> 20:14.547
I'm fine.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.506
The whole neighborhood
is stepping up.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.465
Really?

20:16.465 --> 20:17.967
Do you have friends yet?

20:17.967 --> 20:18.968
Of course.

20:18.968 --> 20:19.969
Who?

20:19.969 --> 20:21.470
You wanna name names?

20:21.470 --> 20:22.847
Eleanor.

20:22.847 --> 20:23.305
That sounds kind of snooty.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.515
She's nice.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.725
And Randie, also nice.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.392
And Blake.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.394
A boy?

20:29.395 --> 20:31.731
A man, I'm not 16 anymore.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.649
Well I'm just glad you're open

20:33.649 --> 20:35.192
to finding love again honey.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.318
Thanks Mom.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.570
I love you.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.280
I love you more.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.614
Stay safe.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.246
Glad you and your son are okay.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.372
Sounds scary.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.957
Super sorry that happened.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.667
Did Officer Wells take a report?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.170
Let us know if you need
anything Julie33.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.379
That's nice.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.758
Hold on, what?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.760
People like me make the
whole neighborhood less safe?

21:00.760 --> 21:01.510
People like you make the

21:01.510 --> 21:02.511
neighborhood less safe.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.429
Greenthumb52.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.682
Get a life.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.975
Maybe you were broken into

21:07.975 --> 21:08.893
because you don't
have enough security.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.644
Get more lights.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.979
We used to have a safe neighborhood.

21:11.979 --> 21:12.688
You thought about getting a dog?

21:12.688 --> 21:13.481
For sure.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.026
It's like they're blaming
me for the break in.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.569
Did they leave their names?

21:18.569 --> 21:21.238
No, just their handles.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.490
Cowards.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.617
You're doing great,
just a few more.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.119
Yeah, you know, some of
these handles are ridiculous.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.704
BigbrotherBert.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.457
Mylawnisbetterthanyours28.
What?

21:33.667 --> 21:35.461
When they're anonymous they feel

21:35.461 --> 21:37.546
like they have a platform
to say whatever they want.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.341
And it hurts peoples feelings.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.967
You know what my handle is?

21:41.967 --> 21:43.093
Niceguy41?

21:43.093 --> 21:44.553
Blake Larson.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.972
'Cause I got nothing to hide.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.476
So,

21:50.476 --> 21:51.143
take 12.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.230
Huh?

21:54.230 --> 21:55.564
There was no huff and puff,

21:55.564 --> 21:56.982
you didn't know what
I was gonna say?

21:56.982 --> 21:59.276
You're gonna do 12 more
is what's gonna happen.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.071
Would you like to
go on a date with me?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.073
I think it's about time.

22:04.073 --> 22:08.035
Don't make me go for a
baker's dozen please?

22:08.035 --> 22:08.869
It's really good.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.538
You're looking great.

22:10.538 --> 22:11.997
Okay, I'll see you at seven.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.761
I, you know,

22:25.761 --> 22:27.471
figured I would just cut straight

22:27.471 --> 22:29.932
to the unconventional and
see if you could handle it.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.767
I can handle it.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.269
But unconventional could
have been, you know,

22:33.269 --> 22:35.354
scuba diving or masquerade ball.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.981
You've been on many
of those have you?

22:36.981 --> 22:38.941
Nah, I'd much
rather be on a date

22:38.941 --> 22:41.819
with my date's nanny and son.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.697
Oh cute face Matty.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.658
He is adorable.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.660
Okay, well you're
not scuba dating,

22:49.660 --> 22:51.453
what do you like to do?

22:51.453 --> 22:53.289
Tell me stuff, you stuff.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.415
Oh me stuff?

22:57.459 --> 23:00.504
I lost my wife three years ago.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.048
It was fast and horrible
and devastating

23:03.048 --> 23:06.468
and I fell into a rabbit
hole I couldn't get out of.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.053
So I took up jogging.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.848
It's therapeutic.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.475
But I did overtrain,
thus the knee injury,

23:13.475 --> 23:15.895
and Dr. Pearson,
and meeting you.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.522
Wow.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.242
Alright, enough about me.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.744
Tell me about your husband.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.580
Well, we were high
school sweethearts.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.040
First everything.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.376
And he was my best friend.

23:41.128 --> 23:41.962
Survivors.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.507
To survivors.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.970
I do hate that phrase.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.597
Survivors?

23:51.597 --> 23:53.641
I mean it's way better than widower.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.768
I just find the phrase
"Survived by their wife

23:55.768 --> 23:57.770
and son" to be pessimistic.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.608
You know, it's like,

24:02.608 --> 24:04.026
I don't know.

24:04.026 --> 24:07.529
Now that he's gone
are we just supposed

24:07.529 --> 24:09.073
to exist?

24:09.073 --> 24:11.075
Instead of thriving.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.618
Yes.

24:12.618 --> 24:13.577
Thriving.

24:15.037 --> 24:15.955
To thriving.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.331
Well alright.

24:21.669 --> 24:24.630
Ooh, nice balance, good job.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.591
You know, they can come
sit with us if you want.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.425
Really?

24:28.425 --> 24:29.218
No.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.679
Yeah I'm sure.

24:31.679 --> 24:32.388
Okay.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.600
Hey Matty, you guys,
come sit with us.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.851
Okay.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.813
Okay, bring your pizza Matty.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.316
Let's do this.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.359
Thank you Marisol.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.110
Hello.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.569
Hi.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.529
How's your pizza?

24:48.529 --> 24:49.405
Awesome.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.906
Good.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.283
Hey Matty, why was
six afraid of seven?

24:53.283 --> 24:55.786
Oh I know, 'cause seven ate nine.

24:55.786 --> 24:56.578
What?

24:56.578 --> 24:57.538
Good one.

24:58.956 --> 24:59.665
Whoa!

25:01.917 --> 25:03.585
Careful. Wow, wild one.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.421
He's feisty.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.464
I don't know what that was.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.757
Blake's a blank dinosaur Mom.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.551
Hey, stickers don't make friends.

25:10.551 --> 25:11.969
It's totally cool!

25:22.896 --> 25:24.231
Oh no, what now?

25:27.735 --> 25:29.403
Are you kidding me?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.072
Excuse me!

25:33.532 --> 25:34.241
Excuse me!

25:36.452 --> 25:37.745
What are you doing?

25:37.745 --> 25:39.496
You're in your pajamas.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.206
Yeah, well, my ball
gown's being pressed.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.250
What are you doing really?

25:44.293 --> 25:46.962
I'm hauling in your trash cans.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.673
Yeah, well, I'm perfectly
capable of doing that myself.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.925
It's nearly eight, the trash
was picked up yesterday.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.802
This is an eyesore.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.679
Okay.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.057
The trash was picked
up yesterday morning.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.559
Yes, I got that the first time.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.439
Look, I'm the resident
matriarch of the block.

26:05.439 --> 26:07.858
I know everything
that happens here.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.986
I'm sorry about your break in.

26:10.986 --> 26:14.823
Thank you, it could of been worse.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.450
If you wanna play by the rules,

26:16.450 --> 26:19.328
keep your front yard
tidy, bring in your trash,

26:19.328 --> 26:20.746
keep your alarm on.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.915
We'll be great friends.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.625
Well that would be nice.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.933
Hey baby, time to get up.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.771
Okay you little sleepy monster.

26:48.232 --> 26:48.941
Matty.

26:50.859 --> 26:51.777
Are we playing hide and seek?

26:51.777 --> 26:52.694
I'm gonna find you.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.570
Matty Matty!

26:56.824 --> 26:57.491
Matty?

26:58.742 --> 26:59.868
Matty?

26:59.868 --> 27:00.828
Matty!

27:04.331 --> 27:04.998
Matty?

27:06.041 --> 27:06.750
Matty!

27:08.585 --> 27:09.336
Matty!

27:11.421 --> 27:12.673
He's six.

27:12.673 --> 27:15.050
Only six-years old.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.386
Shouldn't we be looking
for him right now?

27:17.386 --> 27:18.720
I mean, aren't there
statistics about kids

27:18.720 --> 27:20.472
who've been missing
for 24 hours?

27:20.472 --> 27:21.807
Chances are he's fine.

27:21.807 --> 27:22.975
How?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.393
How do you know this?

27:24.393 --> 27:25.561
Are you psychic?

27:25.561 --> 27:27.646
Do you even have children?

27:27.646 --> 27:28.689
No ma'am, neither.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.857
Then you don't know that.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.483
You don't know that!

27:31.483 --> 27:32.359
Calm down.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.236
Calm down?

27:34.236 --> 27:35.571
Does he have a phone?

27:35.571 --> 27:37.447
Again, he is six.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.782
Could he be on a play
date with someone?

27:38.782 --> 27:39.950
No.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.119
We haven't lived here that long.

27:42.119 --> 27:44.830
Marisol his nanny
is with her family.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.665
She hasn't seen him.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.083
I'm calling Allison but it's
going straight to voicemail.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.252
And she wouldn't know
where he is anyway.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.545
And I know there's a
local patrol officer

27:51.545 --> 27:53.463
but nobody can find him.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.800
Okay I'm sorry, but I
don't know what to do.

28:00.262 --> 28:01.972
We're gonna put on
an APB on your son.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.640
And in the meantime,
is there anyone

28:03.640 --> 28:05.392
That can help you
canvas the neighborhood?

28:05.392 --> 28:06.518
I don't know.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.108
Yes.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.735
Actually, yes, yes.

28:16.028 --> 28:16.737
My neighbors.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.657
Well I just think it's all a little,

28:20.657 --> 28:21.909
this is a little dramatic.

28:21.909 --> 28:22.868
Am I right?

28:22.868 --> 28:23.952
I want you to take a group

28:23.952 --> 28:25.495
and get over to
Diversity and 6th.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.997
I doubt he's gotten that far.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.625
He's a little boy,
anything's possible.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.835
Now the rest of you,
I want you to fan out!

28:31.835 --> 28:34.463
We've been on our feet
for six hours Lydia.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.299
If it were the twins,
would you stop now?

28:37.299 --> 28:38.884
Has anybody seen
Officer Wells?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.969
Oh please, I've
seen commas more

28:40.969 --> 28:42.220
than I've seen that imbecile.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.097
We only have a few
hours of daylight left,

28:44.097 --> 28:46.475
let's find the boy.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.559
You heard the lady.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.686
Lydia, Lydia, anything yet?

28:49.686 --> 28:51.396
Thank you so much for doing this.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.148
Oh this is what neighbors do.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.942
I mean if my security cam
hadn't been on the fritz,

28:54.942 --> 28:56.568
all it does is show black.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.695
Then I could of at least
seen where the boy went.

28:58.695 --> 28:59.571
Oh no, come on please.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.864
You can't blame yourself.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.032
This is just...

29:05.661 --> 29:06.995
Matty.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.830
Is that Matty?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.290
Where's he been?

29:10.290 --> 29:11.917
Is he okay?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.086
Mom, look what I got?

29:14.086 --> 29:15.420
Oh thank god.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.463
Where were you?

29:16.463 --> 29:18.382
I called you like 20 times!

29:18.382 --> 29:20.175
I'm so sorry, my phone died.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.969
But I told you I was
taking him to the fair.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.178
No you didn't.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.055
Yes I did, it's on the calendar Julie.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.515
We talked about it.

29:26.515 --> 29:27.516
That is next month.

29:27.516 --> 29:28.934
It was today.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.602
I mean I tried to wake
you up when we left,

29:30.602 --> 29:33.438
but you were dead to the world.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.982
I'm so sorry.

29:34.982 --> 29:35.983
I know where my kids are.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.818
You just forgot Julie.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.030
It happens.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.825
Everything's fine
but I am so sorry.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.037
Guys everything's fine, it's
just a misunderstanding.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.622
Thank you all for your concern.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.540
You're welcome!

29:51.540 --> 29:52.249
Everything's fine.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.459
I guess.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.961
Honey, let's go inside.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.629
Julie wait!

29:57.629 --> 29:58.380
I can't believe we wasted
the whole afternoon.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.673
I'm glad Matty's okay,

29:59.673 --> 30:01.299
but why doesn't she
know where her son is?

30:01.299 --> 30:02.259
Can you believe she didn't know

30:02.259 --> 30:03.844
where her own child was?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.182
I just spent my entire day

30:09.182 --> 30:11.810
looking a neighbor's missing
kid who wasn't missing.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.728
I hate her.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.895
Okay.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.356
Maybe mykidisgifted87 hates you,

30:17.607 --> 30:19.192
but come on, her kid is gifted.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.946
She probably hates everyone
and their inferior children.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.574
Oh my gosh, where did
they get this photo?

30:25.574 --> 30:26.950
Oh wow.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.076
"Face the facts lady,
some people just

30:28.076 --> 30:29.036
shouldn't be parents.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.455
No one sober loses their kid."

30:31.455 --> 30:33.165
What?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.250
You need to ignore
this Julie, they are--

30:35.250 --> 30:37.210
I had one beer Allison.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.587
No, I know, I get it.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.297
This is ridiculous.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.091
Okay, remember, this
is where cowards vent.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.509
It's their safe space.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.178
It doesn't feel safe.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.682
Screw it, you know what,

30:50.682 --> 30:52.392
this is my home now.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.519
If they're gonna be cowards,
I'm gonna call them out on it.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.772
What are you gonna say?

30:56.772 --> 30:59.983
I love my son. I
thought he was missing.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.528
I would question any parent

31:03.528 --> 31:06.531
who loves their child
as much as I do,

31:06.531 --> 31:08.909
who wouldn't do
exactly the same?

31:11.078 --> 31:12.037
I just...

31:15.457 --> 31:17.209
I feel like this is my fault.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.835
If we wouldn't of gone
to the fair, then--

31:18.835 --> 31:20.212
No.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.214
No, obviously I screwed up the dates.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.590
I mean you're so crazy
about your calendar

31:23.590 --> 31:25.133
I just figured that
you knew and so I--

31:25.133 --> 31:27.219
Totally my fault Ally.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.054
And it was on the calendar.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.430
I mean it was Matty's handwriting.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.431
I don't know. I just--

31:31.431 --> 31:32.891
I got confused.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.063
And he had such a good time.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.525
I had such a good time.

31:45.529 --> 31:46.279
Speaking of a good time.

31:46.279 --> 31:46.947
Oh.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.490
What?

31:48.490 --> 31:50.200
You don't kiss and tell?

31:50.200 --> 31:51.535
It was nice.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.745
I mean he's nice.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.414
Who knows though,
it's all so new.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.125
Well I'm here for
you, you know that.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.210
I mean I'll watch
Matty any time.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.211
You can even stay the night.

32:01.211 --> 32:01.920
Ally!

32:05.298 --> 32:06.967
Yeah, all the kids called
her the pit bull.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.677
She was the absolute worst.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.137
Mrs. Finklemeyer.

32:10.137 --> 32:10.929
Right?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.265
Her name was mean.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.349
I couldn't do anything right.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.434
I was always a quarter inch too long.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.186
Or if I parked my car in the street

32:18.186 --> 32:20.647
for 30 seconds she'd lodge
a complaint with the HOA.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.315
Oh god, you poor thing.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.568
I know, she tortured me.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.570
You're not kidding.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.405
So to say the least,

32:28.405 --> 32:30.115
I can empathize.

32:30.115 --> 32:34.035
Unfortunately we can't change
our neighbors, but...

32:34.035 --> 32:35.162
Yes?

32:35.162 --> 32:37.205
We can choose our friends.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.456
That we can.

32:38.456 --> 32:39.958
Cheers.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.878
Perfect timing.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.048
Oh shoot, I'm sorry.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.633
Blake it's Ally, do
you mind if I take it?

32:48.633 --> 32:50.051
No, of course not.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.220
Hey Ally, how's it going?

32:52.220 --> 32:54.389
I'm just calling to check
in like you asked.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.099
Oh we're having the
time of our lives.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.976
As usual.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.854
So you guys are okay if
I stay out a little longer?

33:00.854 --> 33:01.855
Oh yeah, of course.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.273
Stay out as late as you need.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.151
Okay, well give Matty
a big hug for me

33:06.151 --> 33:07.110
and tell him how
much I love him okay?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.111
Will do.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.529
Have fun.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.114
I owe you big time.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.282
Hey I love my Matty time.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.200
Bye.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.367
Bye.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.913
Was that Mommy?

33:17.913 --> 33:19.247
Yup, sounds like she's
gonna be out a little later

33:19.247 --> 33:21.917
so it's just you and me.

33:21.917 --> 33:22.918
Okay.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.294
Yeah.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.670
All right, keep stirring
that batter buddy.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.256
I need a double fudge
brownie, pronto.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.383
Just so you know,
Mommy doesn't let me

33:30.383 --> 33:31.801
have chocolate this late.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.261
Oh.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.222
Well Mommy's not here
right now is she?

33:35.222 --> 33:37.432
She'll be mad.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.226
Why don't you let
me worry about that.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.645
You're on Auntie Ally
time now aren't you?

33:41.645 --> 33:43.313
Okay.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.232
How is this stuff?

33:45.232 --> 33:46.274
How is it?

33:46.274 --> 33:47.234
Oh.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.526
You should try it.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.280
Mm, it is good.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.990
It's good!

33:56.576 --> 33:57.535
Thank you.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.456
It's nice, they seem
to really get along.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.832
Matty and Allison?

34:02.832 --> 34:04.709
Yeah, he seems
to really love her.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.002
Yeah, he does.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.255
Well, it's nice.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.051
Yeah.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.304
Oh, so anymore incidents?

34:17.304 --> 34:20.058
No, not in a couple of days.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.018
Well, that's encouraging.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.103
Maybe that dark
cloud found another

34:23.103 --> 34:24.603
victim to hover above.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.231
Oh man, I hope so.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.315
I mean enough already right?

34:28.315 --> 34:29.359
Enough is enough.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.782
You're funny.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.371
So you're thinking a collie.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.415
Matty get over here!

34:43.415 --> 34:44.416
Ally!

34:44.416 --> 34:45.917
Hey, I got the afternoon off.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.168
Let's go do something!

34:48.168 --> 34:49.254
Hey!

34:49.254 --> 34:50.213
Ally!

34:50.213 --> 34:50.797
You wanna go get ice cream?

34:50.797 --> 34:51.880
Yes!

34:51.880 --> 34:53.382
Okay hop in.

34:53.382 --> 34:54.592
Hey, Julie said he's
not supposed to have

34:54.592 --> 34:56.803
anymore sugar today.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.596
Boo.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.388
Boo!

34:58.388 --> 34:59.222
I want ice cream!

34:59.222 --> 35:00.265
I want ice cream!

35:00.265 --> 35:01.224
He wants ice cream.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.393
Please, please, please!

35:03.393 --> 35:04.269
You can study
while we're gone.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.521
I'll have him back in an hour.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.814
Fine.

35:07.814 --> 35:08.982
Just have him back before 5:30

35:08.982 --> 35:11.026
or I'm in big trouble.

35:11.026 --> 35:11.776
Say thank you Marisol.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.236
Thank you Marisol!

35:33.214 --> 35:35.300
Not too high,
it's scary up high!

35:35.300 --> 35:37.385
I wanna go higher!

35:44.309 --> 35:46.394
Eleanor look.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.479
She pays more attention to her phone

35:47.479 --> 35:49.147
than her own child.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.150
No wonder he went missing.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.332
Alright, I'm coming
in, I'm coming in!

36:07.332 --> 36:08.333
Here we go!

36:09.292 --> 36:10.877
Woo!

36:10.877 --> 36:13.046
You're gonna be swinging
as high as me!

36:14.798 --> 36:17.050
The one who goes
the highest picks lunch!

36:17.050 --> 36:20.136
I wanna go to the Ferris wheel Mommy.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.180
May I have a grilled
cheese with no pepper

36:22.180 --> 36:23.390
and a side of fries?

36:23.390 --> 36:24.808
Oh that looks so good.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.726
This is the best day Mom!

36:26.726 --> 36:29.312
Look at us, we're high!

36:31.606 --> 36:33.900
Oh why is everybody outside?

36:36.236 --> 36:38.947
What's that noise Mommy?

36:38.947 --> 36:40.949
I don't know honey.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.784
It's really loud.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.160
I have no idea.

36:45.453 --> 36:48.164
Is that coming from our house?

36:49.332 --> 36:50.250
Oh no.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.629
Matty stay in the car honey.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.256
She is on thin ice.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.592
Way to draw a crowd!

36:59.592 --> 37:01.177
Well I...

37:01.177 --> 37:02.512
You know what,
Matthew's in the car,

37:02.512 --> 37:03.555
do you mind getting
him out for me?

37:03.555 --> 37:06.433
Of course, of
course, of course.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.475
What's happening?

37:07.475 --> 37:09.185
I don't know.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.562
笙ｪ You're just 笙ｪ

37:10.562 --> 37:14.399
笙ｪ Another habit going bad on me 笙ｪ

37:14.399 --> 37:16.025
What is going on?

37:23.908 --> 37:25.368
Hey Matty, why don't
you go on inside

37:25.368 --> 37:26.786
honey and wash up, okay?

37:26.786 --> 37:27.454
Thank you.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.499
Everything okay?

37:35.253 --> 37:36.337
Is this where the party's at?

37:36.337 --> 37:37.422
Oh great.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.423
What now?

37:41.885 --> 37:42.761
What?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.137
What do you mean?

37:45.054 --> 37:46.556
You're Julie right?

37:46.556 --> 37:48.433
Yes but no, this is ridiculous.

37:48.433 --> 37:51.311
I'm not throwing a party.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.521
According to that flyer you are.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.523
She's becoming quite
the nuisance isn't she?

37:55.523 --> 37:56.274
Poor woman.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.650
Poor child.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.360
This has to be some kind of prank.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.403
Whatever lady.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.741
You know what everybody just

38:04.741 --> 38:05.950
go back in your homes.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.494
Honestly, between you and I,

38:07.494 --> 38:09.245
she's a stain on this community.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.371
Give her a chance Eleanor.
I had nothing to do

38:10.371 --> 38:11.831
with this!

38:11.831 --> 38:14.209
Just leave me alone.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.506
Well don't play your music so loud.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.596
Why would somebody do this?

38:26.596 --> 38:28.306
Maybe it's kids?

38:28.306 --> 38:31.518
No, kids, children are not
this calculating and malicious.

38:31.518 --> 38:34.687
It's like they're out to get me.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.189
You know Matty,
time for bed honey.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.066
Can Ally read me a story?

38:38.066 --> 38:38.900
Story?

38:38.900 --> 38:40.151
Ooh.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.903
Sure.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.112
You know where your
toothbrush is right?

38:43.112 --> 38:44.531
Yeah.

38:44.531 --> 38:44.989
Okay, go brush
and I'll be right up.

38:44.989 --> 38:45.698
Okay.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.872
How well do you know Eleanor?

38:52.872 --> 38:55.583
Eh, she's not one of my buds

38:55.583 --> 38:56.668
if you know what I mean.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.878
Do you like her?

38:58.878 --> 38:59.963
Promise not to tell?

38:59.963 --> 39:00.713
Ally.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.551
Okay, no I don't.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.511
I think she is petty, judgmental,

39:06.511 --> 39:07.804
and condescending.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.848
And she thinks her twins
are far superior

39:09.848 --> 39:12.976
to any of the other peasant
children in the neighborhood.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.936
Okay wow, you
really don't like her.

39:14.936 --> 39:15.687
Nope.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.440
Actually what it is though,

39:19.440 --> 39:22.443
I don't trust her.

39:22.443 --> 39:23.987
Yeah, why do you ask?

39:25.405 --> 39:28.992
It's just a vibe
I'm getting from her.

39:28.992 --> 39:32.328
Do you think she's mykidisgifted87?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.581
From Hello Neighbor, the hater.

39:34.581 --> 39:36.332
Probably.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.543
I mean it makes total
sense if you think about it.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.171
Maybe.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.340
I don't wanna jump
to any conclusions.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.175
Thank you for the info.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.303
Our little secret?

39:48.303 --> 39:49.095
Pinky swear.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.179
Pinky swear.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.688
Great job Matty.

40:00.023 --> 40:00.773
Nice.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.035
Are you okay?

40:12.035 --> 40:13.411
Yeah.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.537
I'm fine, yeah.

40:15.914 --> 40:16.581
Why?

40:19.834 --> 40:20.710
Are you okay?

40:22.420 --> 40:24.213
Yeah it's just,

40:24.213 --> 40:26.424
actually I saw this last night.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.135
Oh my god.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.850
Look, I know this isn't you,

40:35.850 --> 40:37.185
but someone is really trying to make

40:37.185 --> 40:40.104
it seem like you're crazy or unstable.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.606
Who?

40:41.606 --> 40:42.690
I have no idea.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.860
I just thought you should know.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.821
Are they trying to get
Matty taken from me?

40:48.821 --> 40:51.282
Yeah, looks that way.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.951
But who, why?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.911
I mean that is just evil.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.455
Yeah, I agree.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.291
Maybe you should
call the police.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.086
Yeah, they're not exactly
my biggest fans right now.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.003
I'm sorry.

41:05.421 --> 41:06.798
For what it's worth,
I have a friend

41:06.798 --> 41:08.800
who is a computer
whiz who might be

41:08.800 --> 41:09.717
able to uncover the identity's

41:09.717 --> 41:11.844
for the more aggressive posts.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.930
And then I can send a
cease and desist letter.

41:13.930 --> 41:14.597
If you'd like.

41:14.597 --> 41:15.640
Really?

41:15.640 --> 41:17.183
That would be amazing.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.643
Of course.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.603
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
look how fast I can go!

41:20.603 --> 41:22.188
Look at you, wow!

41:24.524 --> 41:26.484
Hey, your training wheels are off.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.777
Ally took them off for me.

41:27.777 --> 41:31.197
She said I don't need them anymore.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.740
Oh you didn't know?

41:32.740 --> 41:35.201
She was right, see?

41:35.201 --> 41:37.704
Yeah honey she was.

41:37.704 --> 41:38.371
She was.

41:48.715 --> 41:49.674
Ally listen,

41:53.052 --> 41:55.596
someone is stalking me.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.765
Posting photographs.

41:57.765 --> 41:59.892
Yeah these are really creepy.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.019
I mean it's like they're trying

42:01.019 --> 42:03.813
to get Matty taken from me.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.107
How can we figure out
who these are posted from?

42:06.107 --> 42:07.984
You know it's funny
that you mention that.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.110
Marisol thinks that
she can actually

42:09.110 --> 42:10.737
identify the more
aggressive ones

42:10.737 --> 42:12.739
and flush them
into the daylight.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.491
Oh okay, good.

42:15.491 --> 42:17.368
Oh and I already talked to Blake,

42:17.368 --> 42:20.288
he's gonna introduce me
to an attorney on Friday.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.123
Wow, wow okay.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.958
Are we sure that's necessary?

42:23.958 --> 42:25.835
It's getting worse Allison.

42:25.835 --> 42:28.963
It's more than just nosy
overly opinionated neighbors.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.673
Who made that flyer?

42:30.673 --> 42:32.467
It's malicious.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.552
Yeah okay, well you
gotta do what you gotta do.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.428
I would just...

42:36.846 --> 42:38.139
avoid upsetting the neighbors anymore

42:38.139 --> 42:39.432
than we already have.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.184
I know.

42:41.184 --> 42:45.229
I'm sorry I have become the
pariah of your community now.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.231
I feel horrible.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.108
And you brought me here.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.526
But Ally, you have to believe me.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.361
I am not doing anything wrong.

42:52.361 --> 42:53.738
No I do, I do.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.698
Absolutely I believe you.

42:58.826 --> 43:02.997
And Allison, I don't want
to seem unappreciative,

43:02.997 --> 43:04.832
and it was really
really sweet of you

43:04.832 --> 43:07.293
to take Matty's training wheels off.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.711
But that was my job.

43:10.546 --> 43:12.548
Yeah, well,

43:12.548 --> 43:15.051
he was just really excited
to ride like a big boy.

43:15.051 --> 43:17.011
Mommy, can I have a glass of water?

43:17.011 --> 43:19.597
Yeah honey, I'll be right there.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.891
I get it, I do.

43:21.891 --> 43:25.269
I just don't wanna miss the
important moments you know?

43:25.269 --> 43:27.605
Yeah, of course.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.606
It won't happen again.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.482
Thank you.

43:37.490 --> 43:38.866
He's just adorable.

43:38.866 --> 43:40.952
He's doing this little
dance right now.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.329
I think it's called the
flossy or something?

43:43.329 --> 43:44.122
You ever heard of this?

43:44.122 --> 43:45.206
Yes, I have.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.040
Have you?

43:46.040 --> 43:47.708
Yes.

43:47.708 --> 43:48.084
Do you have kids?
Yes I do.

43:49.919 --> 43:51.671
Excuse me a second.

43:58.928 --> 43:59.637
Hello!

44:00.680 --> 44:01.347
Hello!

44:05.810 --> 44:07.311
What do you want?!

44:08.437 --> 44:09.939
What do you want?!

44:09.939 --> 44:11.524
Julie, hey.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.192
What's going on?

44:13.192 --> 44:15.945
I swear somebody was watching me.

44:15.945 --> 44:16.654
Really?

44:18.322 --> 44:20.783
I... Yeah.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.034
I'm okay.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.828
Nevermind.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.371
Look, do you need to take
the rest of the day off?

44:25.371 --> 44:26.873
No of course not.

44:26.873 --> 44:29.584
I'm fine, honestly, I'm fine.

44:29.584 --> 44:30.334
Okay.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.252
Yeah okay.

44:32.879 --> 44:33.880
Thank you.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.047
Of course.

44:36.841 --> 44:38.676
Hang on sweetie,
I'm gonna get that.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.844
Okay.

44:44.765 --> 44:45.683
Hey.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.353
We can't keep doing this.

44:49.353 --> 44:50.605
Keep doing what?

44:50.605 --> 44:52.857
You showing up and hijacking Matty.

44:52.857 --> 44:53.900
Does Julie even know you're here?

44:53.900 --> 44:54.942
Hijacking?

44:54.942 --> 44:56.819
I'm his aunt.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.654
You've made that very clear.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.199
But Mrs. Caster hired me
to watch Matty, not you.

45:01.199 --> 45:04.535
Ms. Caster, she's no longer married.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.454
Whatever the case, it puts
me in an awkward position

45:06.454 --> 45:08.122
and I have to do my job.

45:08.122 --> 45:08.956
Ally!

45:08.956 --> 45:10.082
Hey sweetness!

45:10.082 --> 45:11.584
Hey buddy.

45:11.584 --> 45:12.960
If you wanna take
Matty for ice窶芯ream,

45:12.960 --> 45:14.420
or chocolate, or bike rides,

45:14.420 --> 45:16.923
or whatever you do, just
talk to Mrs. Caster first

45:16.923 --> 45:18.883
so she can let me know.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.054
Ms. Caster.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.142
Matty you have gotten
so good at building stuff.

45:28.142 --> 45:30.102
What am I possibly gonna build?

45:30.102 --> 45:31.520
You could probably
build a train

45:31.520 --> 45:33.022
like that one probably.

45:33.022 --> 45:34.106
All right, I'm gonna head out.

45:34.106 --> 45:35.483
And Julie, when you get a second,

45:35.483 --> 45:38.152
there's something I need
to talk to you about.

45:38.152 --> 45:39.862
About your sister窶進n窶人aw.

45:39.862 --> 45:40.696
Oh, okay.

45:41.864 --> 45:43.699
Is everything all right?

45:45.910 --> 45:47.328
Yeah, it's not urgent.

45:47.328 --> 45:48.162
We can talk Monday.

45:48.162 --> 45:48.913
Are you sure?

45:48.913 --> 45:50.248
Yeah, now worries.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.499
Okay.

45:51.499 --> 45:52.333
Bye Matty.

45:52.333 --> 45:53.584
Bye.

45:53.584 --> 45:54.252
Bye.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.171
Look at this, a train.

45:57.171 --> 45:58.756
I mean look at these
wheels, it's impressive.

46:00.967 --> 46:02.510
Hey, were you able
to pinpoint any of

46:02.510 --> 46:03.928
the users' locations?

46:05.221 --> 46:06.222
Really?

46:06.222 --> 46:07.765
You're a genius.

46:07.765 --> 46:10.059
Is there anything on Trent Way?

46:12.812 --> 46:14.146
I know you're taking a huge risk.

46:14.146 --> 46:15.815
No one's gonna find
out, I promise.

46:15.815 --> 46:17.650
Just give me an address.

46:19.944 --> 46:22.405
You're kidding, I'm listening.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.451
How many houses is
it from the corner?

46:28.452 --> 46:29.328
Are you sure?

46:32.915 --> 46:34.375
Yeah.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.002
I found it.

46:36.002 --> 46:36.794
I gotta go.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.256
It's you.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.867
Just have patience Matthew.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.001
Just a little longer.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.214
Who gets injured playing golf?

47:27.094 --> 47:28.888
Oh it's Matty's school.

47:28.888 --> 47:29.722
Go ahead.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.767
Hello.

47:32.767 --> 47:33.517
What?

47:33.517 --> 47:34.352
She didn't?

47:35.561 --> 47:37.355
Yeah, of course.

47:37.355 --> 47:39.065
I'll be right there.

47:40.232 --> 47:41.776
Is everything okay?

47:41.776 --> 47:42.943
Marisol didn't show up.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.028
Matty's still at school.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.029
Go, go on, go.

47:45.029 --> 47:45.905
Yep. Thank you.

47:57.166 --> 48:00.336
Hi it's Marisol, leave a message.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.963
Marisol, this is the fourth message.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.758
I'm getting worried,
are you okay?

48:05.758 --> 48:07.176
Just call me please.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.017
What the?

48:15.017 --> 48:16.268
Mommy, what was that noise?

48:16.268 --> 48:18.229
Yeah baby, I'm okay.

48:18.229 --> 48:20.356
Just stay upstairs, you hear me?

48:20.356 --> 48:21.440
Stay upstairs.

48:24.693 --> 48:25.444
What the?

48:34.578 --> 48:36.664
Mommy, there's someone outside!

48:36.664 --> 48:37.373
Mommy!

48:39.125 --> 48:40.918
I'm coming Matty.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.132
So this is the rock?

48:46.132 --> 48:47.383
It's similar to the ones that the

48:47.383 --> 48:49.093
neighbors paint and
give to the newcomers.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.636
They call it a fairy rock.

48:50.636 --> 48:53.097
It's a little hokey. You know?

48:53.097 --> 48:54.390
It's similar to...

48:56.058 --> 48:58.269
Okay, it was right here.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.062
Would that be the
rock fairy rock?

49:00.062 --> 49:02.189
I mean literally, it was
just here this morning.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.316
Someone is targeting
me and my son.

49:04.316 --> 49:06.110
And now my nanny is missing.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.111
Missing?

49:07.111 --> 49:08.529
Marisol.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.114
She didn't show up for work today.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.074
So you want to fill out
a missing persons

49:12.074 --> 49:13.409
report on your nanny?

49:13.409 --> 49:16.078
No, because it hasn't
been 24 hours yet

49:16.078 --> 49:19.165
so she's probably
gonna turn up, right?

49:25.421 --> 49:29.383
I know this is a bad
idea, but here it goes.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.177
If anyone has spoken with Marisol,

49:31.177 --> 49:33.012
please let me know, thanks.

49:35.306 --> 49:36.974
More drama from you?

49:36.974 --> 49:38.184
Seriously?

49:38.184 --> 49:39.852
First you lost your son

49:39.852 --> 49:42.396
and now you lose your babysitter?

49:42.396 --> 49:43.272
Looks like you were
too busy helping.

49:45.566 --> 49:46.275
Stop!

49:53.866 --> 49:54.867
I mean, I am,

49:55.868 --> 49:57.661
I mean they think I'm crazy.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.705
They spend their days
and nights bullying me

49:59.705 --> 50:00.664
like we're in grade school.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.124
Ouch.

50:02.124 --> 50:02.917
When all I'm trying
to do is reach out

50:02.917 --> 50:05.085
so that I can find Marisol.

50:05.085 --> 50:06.378
I called her parents, her contacts,

50:06.378 --> 50:08.422
nobody has heard from her.

50:08.422 --> 50:09.924
At the end of today
it's gonna be 48 hours

50:09.924 --> 50:12.092
and I'm filing a
missing persons report.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.594
Okay.

50:13.594 --> 50:14.803
Meanwhile, I can't
even hire a new nanny

50:14.803 --> 50:17.014
because now I have a reputation.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.557
Julie, maybe you
should take a breath

50:18.557 --> 50:19.892
and calm down or I'm gonna
need physical therapy

50:19.892 --> 50:22.394
for my physical therapy.

50:22.394 --> 50:24.063
Oh my God Blake, I'm so sorry.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.272
Yeah that's too hard.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.733
It's okay, I'm fine.

50:27.733 --> 50:29.693
But you, you need to get
off that online board.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.320
It's toxic.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.364
You're right.

50:33.364 --> 50:35.282
My second favorite sentence to hear.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.575
You know, I just was hoping to use

50:36.575 --> 50:39.620
that app so that I could
connect with people.

50:39.620 --> 50:41.330
You know especially for Matty.

50:41.330 --> 50:42.915
That certainly backfired.

50:42.915 --> 50:43.707
I get it.

50:46.126 --> 50:47.628
You know, I think
I can confidently say

50:47.628 --> 50:50.089
that you are my favorite client.

50:52.258 --> 50:54.260
Mm, my favorite therapist.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.137
And friend.

50:57.137 --> 50:58.764
So easy on gams okay?

51:00.182 --> 51:01.725
Yeah.

51:01.725 --> 51:05.354
By the way, what's your
first favorite sentence?

51:05.354 --> 51:07.731
I'll tell you when I hear it.

51:43.434 --> 51:44.935
New landscaping.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.856
Lydia, I mean did
you see anything?

51:48.856 --> 51:52.109
Sorry no hun, I
must be off my game.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.653
Well, you don't really,
you don't have to help me.

51:54.653 --> 51:55.487
No, no, no, no.

51:55.487 --> 51:56.905
I got it.

51:56.905 --> 51:58.365
It's getting sad.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.491
You know, you may wanna take it

51:59.491 --> 52:01.660
a little easy on the booze.

52:03.078 --> 52:04.455
This is not mine.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.292
I mean this, this is not mine.

52:09.793 --> 52:12.254
I mean seriously, I have an
occasional glass of wine Lydia.

52:12.254 --> 52:14.423
Hard liquor makes me ill.

52:14.423 --> 52:16.342
None of this makes sense.

52:17.301 --> 52:18.302
Oh God.

52:20.429 --> 52:22.181
Who would do this to me?

52:26.977 --> 52:28.395
Lydia I'm sorry.

52:28.395 --> 52:29.146
I just.

52:31.190 --> 52:32.149
I'm so tired.

52:33.859 --> 52:36.320
I'm just so tired of all of this!

52:37.738 --> 52:40.324
Oh perfect, just perfect!

52:41.992 --> 52:43.452
Yeah, I'm a lush.

52:43.452 --> 52:45.663
Yeah this is just from today.

52:45.663 --> 52:46.872
I don't doubt it.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.165
Eleanor stop it.

52:51.043 --> 52:52.670
This was you wasn't it?

52:52.670 --> 52:53.962
What?

52:53.962 --> 52:55.339
You and your
little android twins

52:55.339 --> 52:56.507
have wanted me out
of this neighborhood

52:56.507 --> 52:58.217
since day one, haven't you?

52:58.217 --> 52:59.218
Haven't you?

52:59.218 --> 53:00.552
Ms. Mykidsgifted84,

53:01.929 --> 53:04.056
or 86, or 68, whatever.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.851
Okay, come on tiger lady.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.228
Take it down a notch.

53:09.228 --> 53:10.437
You need serious help.

53:10.437 --> 53:12.398
Do you know that?

53:12.398 --> 53:13.899
Oh, I'm crazy?

53:13.899 --> 53:15.442
I'm crazy!

53:15.442 --> 53:17.736
Who is breaking into
houses stealing rocks?

53:17.736 --> 53:21.448
Planting booze in
neighbors trash cans?

53:21.448 --> 53:24.159
She's not worth it, come on.

53:24.159 --> 53:25.327
It's pathetic.
Unbelievable.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.790
Look, I know Eleanor,
and she can be a real

53:29.790 --> 53:32.376
B-I-T-C-H, but she's not evil.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.002
If you're telling the truth and someone

53:34.002 --> 53:35.504
is doing all these terrible
things to you,

53:35.504 --> 53:38.298
then that is one
evil son of a bitch.

53:38.298 --> 53:39.675
Pardon my language.

53:41.385 --> 53:43.595
Oh my goodness, I
mean what did I just do?

53:43.595 --> 53:44.513
Oh don't worry about them.

53:44.513 --> 53:46.223
In two weeks they'll be whining

53:46.223 --> 53:48.267
about the sprinklers and
you'll be yesterday's news.

53:48.267 --> 53:49.351
Come on.

53:49.351 --> 53:50.561
Thank you Lydia.

53:55.107 --> 53:57.568
Thank you so much
for coming over.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.528
My nerves are just fried.

53:59.528 --> 54:00.362
I don't wanna be alone tonight.

54:00.362 --> 54:01.613
Yeah, no.

54:01.613 --> 54:02.698
Of course, I'm glad you called.

54:02.698 --> 54:03.741
Pajama party.

54:06.493 --> 54:09.079
You know I'm worried about Marisol.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.498
Oh well she'll show up.

54:11.498 --> 54:12.624
She's in her 20s.

54:12.624 --> 54:13.459
She probably has a whole other life

54:13.459 --> 54:15.210
you don't even know about.

54:16.420 --> 54:17.379
I don't know.

54:17.379 --> 54:18.714
She's a pretty good girl.

54:18.714 --> 54:19.423
Maybe.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.891
You know, she was going to
tell me something about you.

54:28.891 --> 54:29.600
She was?

54:31.351 --> 54:32.478
What?

54:32.478 --> 54:35.606
I can't imagine what it is.

54:35.606 --> 54:40.360
Well, probably about how
awesome of an aunt I am.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.069
Maybe.

54:45.407 --> 54:48.327
I'm sure we'll find out eventually.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.788
So how are things with Blake?

54:51.788 --> 54:52.831
Really good.

54:54.541 --> 54:57.961
Yeah, he has been so
supportive and patient.

54:57.961 --> 55:00.130
I mean I don't know how
he's dealing with me,

55:00.130 --> 55:03.425
but I haven't felt this way in--

55:04.051 --> 55:04.760
A long time?

55:04.760 --> 55:05.469
Yeah.

55:06.553 --> 55:07.513
It's nice.

55:07.513 --> 55:08.764
And Matty loves him.

55:08.764 --> 55:11.266
They're adorable together.

55:11.266 --> 55:13.477
He's actually gonna take
us on a picnic tomorrow.

55:13.477 --> 55:15.103
Oh really?

55:15.103 --> 55:16.647
'Cause I was gonna
take him to the zoo.

55:16.647 --> 55:17.940
You were?

55:17.940 --> 55:21.068
When were you gonna tell me that?

55:21.068 --> 55:23.529
I'm sorry, I forgot.

55:23.529 --> 55:24.446
Yeah, no, of course,

55:24.446 --> 55:25.822
have fun.

55:25.822 --> 55:28.951
Yeah, I'll find
something else to do.

55:28.951 --> 55:29.660
Alright.

55:37.543 --> 55:39.086
You know what,
I'm gonna actually

55:39.086 --> 55:40.712
gonna go get myself
ready for bed.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.464
Otherwise I'm never gonna get
up for work in the morning.

55:42.464 --> 55:46.802
So thank you again for
just being here tonight.

55:46.802 --> 55:47.886
Goodnight sis.

55:50.722 --> 55:51.640
Night sis.

56:03.777 --> 56:04.486
Matthew.

56:21.795 --> 56:24.256
I love you so much my Matthew.

56:25.716 --> 56:26.425
My Ally.

56:29.136 --> 56:30.762
Mommy.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.598
Huh?

56:32.598 --> 56:33.849
Call me Mommy.

56:33.849 --> 56:35.726
But you're not my Mommy.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.686
Shh, it's okay.

56:37.686 --> 56:40.022
It's just a game.

56:40.022 --> 56:40.731
Say it.

56:43.066 --> 56:45.068
Just say it, it's a game.

56:46.111 --> 56:47.321
Just say it.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.530
Mommy.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.407
That's good.

56:50.407 --> 56:52.117
Go to sleep sweetheart.

57:02.502 --> 57:04.671
So, then what happened little man?

57:04.671 --> 57:06.590
Well, then I think that he got ate

57:06.590 --> 57:07.758
by the Kleenex man.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.426
He got eaten buddy.

57:09.426 --> 57:11.386
He got ate by the Kleenex man.

57:11.386 --> 57:12.638
Ate.

57:12.638 --> 57:14.306
Okay you win.

57:14.306 --> 57:16.183
He got ate by the Kleenex man.

57:16.183 --> 57:17.434
Yeah.

57:17.434 --> 57:18.769
Hey you like prizes.

57:18.769 --> 57:19.770
Yeah I love 'em,
do you have 'em?

57:19.770 --> 57:21.313
Yes I got some.

57:21.313 --> 57:22.939
Oh my word.
Whoa!

57:22.939 --> 57:24.441
That's a big ole bag.
I know, it's a little much.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.400
Okay Santa.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.110
I'm sorry.

57:27.110 --> 57:28.111
Yeah just go ahead.

57:28.111 --> 57:28.820
Go nuts.

57:30.906 --> 57:32.449
Marshmallows!

57:32.449 --> 57:33.408
Sunglasses!

57:33.408 --> 57:34.826
What?

57:34.826 --> 57:37.287
Keep going, keep going.

57:37.287 --> 57:38.413
You look so cool.

57:38.413 --> 57:39.456
Ooh.

57:39.456 --> 57:40.457
Oh a fishing rod.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.500
There's a rod!

57:41.500 --> 57:42.584
I guess we're gonna go fishing.

57:42.584 --> 57:43.835
What?

57:43.835 --> 57:45.879
Okay, I don't know
what you're up to

57:45.879 --> 57:49.716
but I think you've
made a friend for life.

57:49.716 --> 57:51.885
Matty, do you know
what's going on?

57:51.885 --> 57:52.969
Nope.

57:52.969 --> 57:54.888
But dinosaur!

57:54.888 --> 57:55.931
Yeah!

57:58.392 --> 57:59.851
Awesome.

57:59.851 --> 58:01.103
No, everything's just
been so crazy lately

58:01.103 --> 58:03.021
I thought we could
all just use some fun.

58:03.021 --> 58:04.022
So I arranged for us to go to my

58:04.022 --> 58:05.774
buddy's cabin at Willow Lake.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.526
You did did you?

58:07.526 --> 58:09.069
Yeah, I just need to grab a brace

58:09.069 --> 58:10.654
from Dr. P and we're off.

58:10.654 --> 58:11.697
Like camping?

58:11.697 --> 58:13.031
So camping.

58:13.031 --> 58:14.950
We're gonna go hiking, fishing,

58:14.950 --> 58:16.410
swimming, s'mores.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.371
All the s'mores you can handle.

58:19.371 --> 58:20.706
But, we're going next
weekend, it's a long weekend.

58:20.706 --> 58:22.374
If that's okay with you.

58:22.374 --> 58:23.917
Okay, I think it's okay.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.836
Yeah, we're gonna go now.

58:25.836 --> 58:26.920
We're gonna go now.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.964
I'll bring my fishing rod.

58:30.757 --> 58:32.968
So Grace, I need you
to change the six o'clock

58:32.968 --> 58:35.137
to a 4:30 because
I have to leave early.

58:35.137 --> 58:35.846
Hey Dr. P.

58:35.846 --> 58:37.055
Hey Blake.

58:37.055 --> 58:38.557
Good to see ya.

58:38.557 --> 58:40.475
It's Julie's day off you know.

58:40.475 --> 58:41.893
Oh I know, I just
was hoping to get

58:41.893 --> 58:44.688
a leg reinforcement
brace from you today.

58:44.688 --> 58:45.731
Are you okay?

58:45.731 --> 58:46.898
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:46.898 --> 58:48.483
Yeah, never better.

58:48.483 --> 58:49.651
I'm just taking Julie and
Matty to the lake next week

58:49.651 --> 58:51.778
and probably a lot of hiking, walking.

58:51.778 --> 58:53.029
So I just wanna play it safe.

58:53.029 --> 58:54.906
So things are?

58:54.906 --> 58:57.033
Amazing, amazing.

58:57.033 --> 58:57.659
And you?

58:59.411 --> 59:02.789
Are grateful that you
encouraged me to ask her out.

59:02.789 --> 59:04.833
Excellent, you're welcome.

59:04.833 --> 59:05.917
Let's go get the brace.

59:05.917 --> 59:07.711
Alright, thanks Dr. P.

59:10.297 --> 59:12.549
I'm gonna get you.

59:14.134 --> 59:16.470
You're so fast, you're so fast.

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:03.099
You got it.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:03.934
I need help!

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:04.935
I gotcha I gotcha!

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.146
Oh shoot, hold on honey.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.106
Oh.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.944
Hey everybody, I'm gonna
answer my phone right now.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.987
So if you wanna
collect your jury

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:17.405
and take your pictures,

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:20.325
I'm just gonna be right
over here with my kid.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:21.076
Okay?

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.619
With my kid.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.620
Come here sweetheart.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.205
Mom, why are you yelling?

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.540
You know what
sweetie, it's just so

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.791
that everybody can
hear me, that's all.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:28.917
Okay.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:29.709
Hello.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:30.961
Doc.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.212
Oh Jenny.

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:36.633
Oh my God.

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:44.099
Hey.

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:44.933
Oh no I've got it.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:45.767
Ally.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:47.102
Hey buddy.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:47.894
Oh big dude.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.314
Thank you so much for taking him.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.357
Yeah, I can't believe it.

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:53.650
Do they know what happened?

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.901
I only know what Jenny told me.

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.027
Doc found him in the alley

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.487
and now he's in emergency surgery.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.197
What's a surgemy?

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.574
It's where a very smart doctor

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.993
uses his best magic to
make the owie go away.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.202
Can I see?

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:05.412
Not this time sweetie.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.872
Yeah, Mommy's gotta go.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:07.873
Okay say goodbye though okay?

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:08.707
Bye.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:09.666
Bye.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.375
Bye mommy.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.793
Bye.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:12.460
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything okay?

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.044
Okay.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.045
I love you.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:15.213
I love you too.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.344
Not as much as I do.

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.140
Is this for our
camping trip with Blake?

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.642
No, no this is for
our camping trip.

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.060
You and I.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.938
Never been camping before.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:35.191
So we'll always remember
how special it is.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:37.152
This is another first for us.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:38.904
Do you understand?

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:41.072
Yeah, no matter how many
times we go camping,

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.950
we'll always remember
the first time.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:47.662
Oh come here.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.386
Julie.

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:07.807
Oh.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:09.601
Shh.

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.021
I'm here.

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.273
Where am I?

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:18.818
You're at the hospital.

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:19.861
What happened?

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:23.990
Well you,

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:28.036
you were attacked.

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:28.787
Attacked?

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:33.124
Just rest okay,
you're gonna be alright.

01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:34.793
Oh, my knee.

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:39.839
I know Blake, I'm so sorry.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.968
They put in about a
dozen pins and screws.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.346
I'm glad you're here.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.183
Of course I'm here.

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:55.063
You're gonna be okay.

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:01.152
And the town cheered
as he came down

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:03.196
the mountain with the magic pig

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:06.157
which he put safely back
into the hands of the queen.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.910
And then the little boy
stayed with the fairy princess

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.121
and they lived happily ever after.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.205
Tell it again!

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.834
I love that story.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.003
Me too.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.257
Ally, Matty?

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:25.051
We're out here.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:25.969
Mommy!

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:26.928
Hey!

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.097
Hi.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.349
How's Blake?

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:33.852
It's pretty bad.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.061
I'm so sorry.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.479
Yeah, Matty you wanna say goodnight?

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.564
Let's go home.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:39.899
No, Ally's taking me camping.

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:44.487
Okay, I'm really tired
honey, so please don't argue.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.156
I wanna go camping.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.574
I did kind of promise.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.993
Please Mommy, please?

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.870
Okay okay.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:52.954
Yay!

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.373
Can I stay the night too?

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.208
I don't really wanna be alone.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.252
Oh, yeah, it's just,

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.714
I mean it's barely
a two person tent.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.257
But you know, I can
put you up in my room,

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.426
it's much more comfortable.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.262
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:10.430
Are you sure?

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.058
I'll be great.

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:14.559
Okay, okay cool.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:16.728
You guys have fun.

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:17.562
Thanks.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:18.313
Yeah, you too.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:19.272
Sleep tight.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.079
Had to have a little Matty time

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:35.497
before I start my day.

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:38.833
It's almost like he's
alive again in Matty.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.587
I mean I'll watch Matty any time.

01:04:42.587 --> 01:04:43.963
You can even stay the night.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:45.423
And I live only four blocks away.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:47.050
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.552
I mean it's barely
a two person tent.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.471
About your sister窶進n窶人aw.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:52.430
Mean Mommy.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:19.457
Marisol.

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:50.238
Sleep well?

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:51.489
Yeah.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.199
This bed is so comfortable.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:53.908
Yeah.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.579
Matty's still asleep.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:05:58.913
You want some coffee?

01:05:58.913 --> 01:05:59.914
Sure.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.585
I'll go make some.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.428
Hey, here you go.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.097
I hope you like it hot.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:16.806
Thanks.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:24.939
You okay?

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:27.942
Yup.

01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:31.070
It's just everything you know?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:31.988
Mmm, mmm hmm.

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:34.282
You sure?

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:36.868
I'm fine.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:41.039
Mommy, Mommy, look what
the tooth fairy gave me.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.332
When did this happen?

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:43.625
Last night.

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.586
I had a caramel apple
and it came out.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.588
You gave him a caramel apple?

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:50.840
Yeah, yeah it's camping food.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.845
Why are you mad?

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.472
It's a first.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.974
How many times have I told
you firsts are important?

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:01.017
It's okay Mom.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.315
You know what buddy, let's
go get your stuff okay?

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.358
We're gonna go home, right now.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:09.150
Okay.

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.193
What?

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.319
What's happening?

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.199
You can't keep doing this.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:16.991
What?

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.159
Undermining me.

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:22.455
Training wheels, sugar, camping,

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:24.165
the tooth fairy.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:25.250
Where is Marisol?

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.546
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.507
Think about it.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:35.260
Think about what Julie?

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.971
What are you implying?

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.098
Maybe we just need some
space from each other

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:41.724
for a little while.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.229
Matty I'm coming sweetie.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.282
Well, it's not terrible news.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.032
Thanks doc.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:04.038
Hey you.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:04.872
Hey.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:06.249
How are you?

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.875
Never better.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:08.584
And you?

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.341
What's the matter?

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.051
You know, I don't wanna
bother you with my stuff.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.970
I mean you're in the hospital.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:22.098
Julie, your stuff
is my stuff, go ahead.

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:27.353
I think Allison
knows where Marisol is.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.063
Okay.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.523
Why is this?

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:34.484
I found Marisol's
phone in Allison's house.

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:35.153
You think she could of left

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.904
it there on accident?

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.032
As far as I know, she's
never been to her house.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:41.158
I think she would of told me that.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:42.827
Maybe, maybe not.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.455
You think I'm being paranoid.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.247
I know.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:48.957
Well what's her motive?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.795
I mean she's spent years
trying to get you out here.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.212
True.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:55.340
So why would she would
do everything

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.384
humanly possible to
get you to leave?

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.345
I don't know.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:02.055
But something is not right.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:03.014
I know it.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:04.849
It's okay.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.310
I believe you.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.188
I believe you.

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.147
Thank you.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.191
Thank you.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.303
I think I found the motive.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.011
Really?

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:48.267
I need you to sign
up for Hello Neighbor.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:48.975
Okay.

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:59.362
You sure this is going to work?

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.155
I have to clear my name.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.200
I know Allison is behind this.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.743
I just need proof.

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:09.288
How about legaleagle23?

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:11.165
Okay, legaleagle23.

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:13.042
Okay, let me take over.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.338
It has been brought to my attention

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.549
that you are the sister in law

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:22.593
of one Julie Caster.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:28.349
I have been made aware
of certain irrational

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:31.060
and potentially dangerous behaviors.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.354
Just going with it huh?

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:36.107
She is clearly unfit.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.944
Ooh you're good.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:42.363
Fight fire with fire right?

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:45.241
I am offering my services pro bono

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:48.035
if you feel an intervention is necessary

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:52.373
to ensure the safety and
well being of the child.

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:53.583
Best, Jeremiah.

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:57.211
And we wait.

01:10:58.838 --> 01:10:59.922
And we wait.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.596
Officer Ramsey.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.222
We found Ms. Gracialis.

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:09.682
Well thank goodness.

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:10.641
Where is she?

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:14.145
May I come inside?

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:17.857
Of course, yeah.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:18.566
Come on in.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:22.278
When's the last time you saw her?

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.154
Mrs. Caster?

01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:26.783
Mrs. Caster, did you hear me?

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.326
No, no wait.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:30.495
Where did you find her?

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:34.290
I'm afraid that information
is confidential right now.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.295
When's the last time you saw her?

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.215
I told you.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:43.508
She left after work Friday evening

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:45.676
and didn't return on Monday.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:51.390
Wait.

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.517
Am I a suspect?

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.270
Seriously?

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.357
We're exploring all possible leads.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.275
You want a lead?

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:04.362
My sister窶進n窶人aw has her phone.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:05.530
That's impossible.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.156
No, I saw it myself.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:12.870
Mrs. Caster, the phone was
found on the deceased body.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.373
That's not...

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:18.751
What?

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:25.007
Do you need anything else from me?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.425
No ma'am.

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:30.137
But if you hear anything give me a call.

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:30.847
I will.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.822
Why can't I go to Ally's?

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.742
Well, for right now it's--

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.995
My bibbby's there.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:54.829
What?

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:56.873
Bibbby, dad's bibbby.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:01.544
Ally said I had to live at
her house and I want it.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:04.881
Mommy will get you back your Bibbby.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.257
Matty.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:07.133
Yes Mommy.

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:12.138
Do you and Auntie
Ally have other secrets?

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:17.143
It's okay baby,
you can tell Mommy.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.480
She showed me on the calendar

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.983
where to write the amusement park

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:27.403
and she told me
I couldn't tell you.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.530
She told you to do that?

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.282
Is that bad?

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.700
No honey.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.285
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:34.994
Okay?

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:38.873
But promise me no
more secrets okay.

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:39.749
I promise.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:42.627
I love you.

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:43.794
I love you too.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.697
Is everything okay?

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.952
What's the matter Mommy?

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:16.994
Nothing honey.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.792
It's fine sweetheart.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.255
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:29.006
Sure.

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:30.466
One more set after this.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.968
I'll be right back.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.552
Sorry, thank you.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.014
I need you to do something for me.

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:40.226
Of course, what do you need?

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:44.063
If anyone asks,
and I mean anyone,

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:45.940
I need you to tell
them that you fired me.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.566
What?

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:49.110
It's just for this next week.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:52.488
I'm gonna ask you
to trust me on this.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:55.116
Okay, no questions asked.

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:55.783
Okay.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:58.869
Is everything okay?

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:00.830
It will be.

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:03.040
Thank you.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.125
Dr. P thank you.

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:11.507
Okay.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.221
Hey, it's me.

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.182
Can you come over?

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:20.933
I miss you.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:23.394
Okay.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:30.443
You're moving?

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.403
I mean Dr. Pearson fired me.

01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:34.071
What?

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.282
Of course he would.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:38.284
I mean he heard all the rumors.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.161
And then he went and told Blake.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:40.911
What?

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:41.787
What?

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.040
Why would he do that?

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.499
Blake doesn't wanna
deal with all this drama

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:47.084
so he broke up with me.

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:48.919
Can you believe that?

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:50.546
Sweetie.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.135
I mean there's nothing
left here for me.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.928
Well what about me?

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:00.598
Oh Ally.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:03.392
I'm sorry.

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:06.520
You have been so great.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.440
And the last thing
I wanna do is hurt you.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.317
But ever since we've moved here

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.277
it's just one thing after another.

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:16.197
I can't take it, I feel
like I'm going crazy.

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:19.658
I get it, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.329
So when are you going?

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.206
The day after tomorrow.

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:25.873
What?

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.668
I know, I already hired the movers.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.212
Wow you're serious.

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.715
I don't have a choice.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:40.930
So where will you go?

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:43.933
I don't know.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:00.908
Hey, what's going on?

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.868
She wants to meet Jeremiah.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:04.537
Are you serious?

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:05.329
When?

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.372
ASAP.

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:07.581
Oh okay, wow.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:11.627
Well tell her Jeremiah
can meet her tonight.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.838
I should go with you.

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:15.297
You can't even walk honey.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.133
And I can handle this.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.592
I don't like it.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:19.969
Well you're just
gonna have to trust me.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:21.929
I'm a survivor remember?

01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:23.222
I do.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.640
Just be careful.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.225
Of course.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:26.934
Bye.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.286
Hey Julie, I wasn't expecting you.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.037
I know, and I know we were gonna

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.247
say our goodbyes tomorrow,

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:51.083
but I'm just feeling so conflicted.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.210
And Matty wanted me to
give this back to you.

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:55.004
He said it would remind you of him.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.089
Oh sure, thanks.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.215
Can I come in?

01:17:58.215 --> 01:17:59.216
Well--

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.051
It'll just be a second.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.972
Second, yeah, sure.

01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:10.895
I just wanted you to know that

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:14.148
everything you've done has
been so deeply appreciated.

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:15.316
And I wish that this
worked out differently.

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:17.109
You know actually,
can we do this later?

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:17.985
Can we do this later?

01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:19.653
This is not a good time for me?

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:20.529
Why?

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:21.822
What's going on?

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.159
I'm expecting someone.

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:25.951
Really?

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:27.036
Yeah.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.121
What's his name?

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:29.830
His?

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:33.042
Jeremiah?

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:37.838
Legaleagle23?

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:43.552
It's easy to hide
behind handles isn't it?

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.595
How did--

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:47.097
I didn't at first.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:48.515
But then I realized,

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:53.312
who else would truly have a motive.

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:56.357
This has all been about Matty.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:58.234
Hey, Julie.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:58.984
Hang on a minute.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.027
Now no, no, no, no.

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:01.028
This is me.

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:02.529
I'm your sister窶進n窶人aw.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:05.199
No, none of this makes any sense.

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.201
Hang on, I know how to
clear this up, hang on.

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:08.953
What are you doing?

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:12.206
Ally.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:16.418
Matthew is dead because of you.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:19.630
What?

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.676
You know what they
say about twins?

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:25.678
How connected they are.

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:27.638
Spiritually, psychically.

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:29.974
Well it's true.

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.142
It's true.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:37.856
Matthew was closer to
me than my own heart.

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:42.569
And you cannot comprehend that.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:44.697
You can't blame me
for what happened.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:47.199
But I do blame you Julie!

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.909
I do!

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:53.414
You should of died in that
accident, not my brother.

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:57.251
Do you not think that I don't
wonder that all the time?

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:58.794
No I don't, I don't!

01:19:58.794 --> 01:19:59.503
Sit down!

01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:01.130
Sit!

01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:07.011
And I don't care how you
feel or what you think.

01:20:08.345 --> 01:20:10.931
At first I just wanted you to suffer.

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:14.601
To just feel one ounce
of the pain that I felt.

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.108
And then there was Matty

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:25.154
and I held his tiny body in my arms.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:33.495
And I looked over at Matthew,

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:36.832
he wasn't there.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:38.876
I know.

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:42.504
I know, I loved him too.

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.465
He was my husband.

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:47.634
But then I felt
it Julie, I felt it.

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:50.804
I felt it, I felt him in Matty.

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:53.349
It was like,

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:58.270
it was like he had never died.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.064
Matthew died in a car accident.

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:01.065
No he didn't!

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:02.649
His body died but he was--

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.026
That's not real.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:07.029
No matter how badly you
want that to be true.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.703
Are you saying I'm crazy?

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.288
Hmm?

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:19.166
That it's all in my head?

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:22.294
Odd, because I have message boards

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:23.962
filled with testimonies about how

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:26.256
crazy and delusional you are.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:32.346
The cops are gonna
have a field day Julie.

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.640
And when I call them,
and I'm gonna,

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.476
and I'll say help, help!

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:39.520
My sister in law's
losing her mind!

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:41.814
She's trying to break into my house!

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.941
Oh she's got a knife, help!

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:48.445
Hmm.

01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:12.970
Oh my God.

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:16.306
Ally.

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:26.775
Once they find out
that you're a psychopath

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.277
capable of murder,

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.864
well then who's gonna be
at the top of the list

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:34.491
to take custody of little Matty huh?

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.034
They'll never believe you.

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:40.372
I've spent the last five
years of my life on this.

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:43.250
And piece by piece I
chipped away at you.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:46.462
Your relationships,
your reputation,

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:47.337
your sanity.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:50.299
Bravo.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:51.133
I'm impressed.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:54.553
Oh, did you think that position

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:57.764
just miraculously opened
up with Dr. Pearson, huh?

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:58.599
What are you talking about?

01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:00.267
Oh you know.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.351
Amy Ferguson.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.689
Hello, she's dead, I killed her.

01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:09.485
Oh but her shirts are very
nicely folded upstairs.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:11.069
And I did bury her body
in your backyard.

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.488
I hope that's fine.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.991
You're sick Ally.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.493
You need help.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:19.620
According to the entire neighborhood

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.538
and the local police,
you need a heck of

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:23.540
a lot more help than I do.

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:27.211
What about Marisol?

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:28.712
She's dead.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:30.964
Killed with a fairy rock
that you used to kill her.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:34.218
And your fingerprints
are all over that.

01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:35.594
I did think that through.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:37.179
I thought it through.

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:39.932
And Blake?

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:41.225
Guilty as charged.

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:45.521
But yeah Julie, who
are they gonna believe?

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:46.396
Huh?

01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:47.356
Who?

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:51.944
The whacked out alcoholic,
child abuser,

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.570
who calls the cops
more often than

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.364
the pizza delivery guy.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:56.740
Yeah, just think about it.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.576
I don't know, what
do you think huh?

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:01.161
You're delusional.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:02.996
Yeah well, according to
the court of public opinion,

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:04.915
that would be you, again.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.253
Police, open up!

01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:12.589
Responding to a disturbance.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:13.882
Police, open up!

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:18.428
Thanks for the DNA evidence.

01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:30.816
Police, open up!

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.111
Officer, thank God!

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:35.362
Officer, she's delusional.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:36.822
She's trying to kill me.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:37.614
Hands up!

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.828
Go, go check the dinosaur.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:43.912
Excuse me?

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.539
Go check the dinosaur.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:47.207
Come on guys.

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:55.299
I found that in my son's room.

01:24:58.176 --> 01:24:58.927
Hit rewind.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.266
Stop, press play.

01:25:05.475 --> 01:25:08.687
Amy Ferguson, hello.

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.772
She's dead, I killed her.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:14.568
Oh, but her shirts are very
nicely folded upstairs.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.069
And I did bury her body
in your backyard,

01:25:16.069 --> 01:25:17.446
I hope that's fine.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.281
If you keep listening,

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.242
she's gonna confess that she
murdered Marisol Gracialis

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:24.494
and hurt my boyfriend.

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:25.621
Take her to the station.

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.331
What?

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:28.540
No, those are lies!

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.499
Those are lies!

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:31.251
I'm gonna kill you!

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:32.461
He loves me!

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:35.297
I'm his Mommy! I'm his Mommy!

01:25:35.297 --> 01:25:37.841
He loves me! He loves me!

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:44.222
He loves!

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:46.683
I imagine this is where
I apologize Mrs. Caster.

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:48.185
I'm gonna kill you!

01:25:48.185 --> 01:25:49.519
Apology accepted.

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.607
I'll see you at the station.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:54.941
Thank you.

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:12.042
So, all that time at the hospital
got me thinking.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:13.669
Oh you've been thinking have you?

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:15.045
Well do tell.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:18.507
That Matty would make
a great older brother.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:19.508
Really?

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:22.552
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:23.512
No reason.

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:27.140
Mommy, Mommy look!

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.684
What is this?

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:29.976
Rocks Mommy.

01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:31.770
People have been coming
by all day honey.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:33.772
They're really hoping you'd stay.

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:37.401
Well, I do have plenty
of reasons to stay now.

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:39.569
Oh and my Mom has a
little announcement.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:41.113
Oh, that's right.

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:42.698
I've decided to move down here

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:45.784
so I can be closer
to all of you guys.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:48.078
My daughter's very persistent.

01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:49.705
I can't imagine where
she gets that from.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:52.582
Thank you though,
for sticking with me

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:54.084
through all this craziness.

01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:55.794
Well when you love someone

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:58.463
you stick around no matter what.

01:26:58.463 --> 01:26:59.756
I love you too.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:00.841
There it is.

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:01.800
What?

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.261
That's my favorite sentence.

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:06.596
Awe.

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:09.599
Ooh!

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:13.937
Who wants brownies?

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:15.397
Me!

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.022
Okay, we're gonna
go in the house.

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:16.773
Everybody come on in.

01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:17.816
Alright!

01:27:17.816 --> 01:27:18.734
Yay brownies!

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.112
Got it?

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:23.405
Yup.

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:24.573
If that kid's cooking those brownies

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:26.575
I'm gonna tell him gluten free.

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:27.701
Oh my triceps look awesome.

01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:30.370
Very funny.
