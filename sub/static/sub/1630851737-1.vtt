00:08.875 --> 00:10.166
Cha-chung!

01:08.333 --> 01:11.583
Long, long ago,
when magic turned the world,

01:11.666 --> 01:17.125
in a time some cannot remember,
but our hearts will never forget,

01:17.208 --> 01:21.458
in a kingdom past the ferocious pumas
of the Golden Mountains…

01:22.750 --> 01:25.333
…just above the deadly skulls

01:25.416 --> 01:27.416
-of the Jungle Lands…

01:27.500 --> 01:31.875
…and just below
the magical roosters of Luna Island…

01:34.208 --> 01:37.000
…resting above an ancient secret lake,

01:37.083 --> 01:40.500
was the legendary Kingdom of Teca.

01:40.583 --> 01:43.875
There, the ancients told
of a great prophecy,

01:43.958 --> 01:46.583
-that a Mighty Eagle…

01:46.666 --> 01:49.333
…and three courageous jaguars…

01:51.125 --> 01:55.291
…would one day vanquish
the dark lords of the underworld!

01:57.250 --> 01:58.416
-But know this,

01:58.500 --> 02:00.416
though prophecies may give hope,

02:00.500 --> 02:02.583
-the battle will still be fought…

02:02.666 --> 02:04.208
-…for victory rides

02:04.291 --> 02:06.916
-on the shoulders of heroes!

02:17.666 --> 02:21.083
Look! It's the Teca Eagle!

02:54.458 --> 02:55.916
-Mm-hmm!

03:00.208 --> 03:02.458
Jaguars, did you bring the package?

03:06.333 --> 03:09.916
On my command, we engage. Ready?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.666
Uno, dos--

03:11.750 --> 03:13.333
-¡Tres!
-¡Tres!

03:13.416 --> 03:16.333
Happy Day of Coronation, Maya!

03:17.458 --> 03:18.916
-Huh?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.333
Hey, uh, perhaps a little louder.

03:22.416 --> 03:25.750
Happy Day of Coronation, Maya!

03:29.000 --> 03:29.916
Lance, go!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.416
Beloved sister, Maya,

03:31.500 --> 03:34.375
your brother Lance
dove into the Cursed Ocean,

03:34.458 --> 03:39.166
narrowly escaped the sea beast,
and brought you the Golden Pearl!

03:41.833 --> 03:43.416
-Huh?
-Daggers, go!

03:43.500 --> 03:44.708
Move aside.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.833
Your brother Daggers
invaded a burning pirate ship,

03:47.916 --> 03:50.500
-fought the nefarious Bandit Queen…

03:50.583 --> 03:52.958
-…and stole her jeweled earring!

03:53.458 --> 03:54.583
Ha!

03:56.291 --> 03:57.833
-Aw.
-Shield, go!

03:57.916 --> 03:59.125
Amateurs.

03:59.208 --> 04:03.541
Your most-courageous brother Shield
went deep into the Cursed Forest,

04:03.625 --> 04:06.083
outran a deadly avalanche of doom,

04:06.166 --> 04:07.875
-and found you…

04:07.958 --> 04:10.750
…this majestic turquoise bird!

04:10.833 --> 04:11.666
Oh!

04:11.750 --> 04:14.958
-Behold its majestic majesty!

04:18.041 --> 04:19.541
-Ahem.

04:19.625 --> 04:20.458
One,

04:21.416 --> 04:22.375
you're all late.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.458
-But, mi amor--

04:24.541 --> 04:25.916
And two…

04:30.166 --> 04:32.375
-Oh my gods!
-A wizard turned--

04:32.458 --> 04:34.041
Maya into a turkey!

04:36.500 --> 04:39.458
Husband, your daughter
has been out all night.

04:40.041 --> 04:43.208
These are not
the ways of a Teca princess.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.416
-Maya!

04:52.833 --> 04:54.333
And on her day of birth.

04:57.666 --> 05:00.041
Maya's rebel fire burns bright,

05:00.125 --> 05:01.083
just like yours.

05:03.541 --> 05:04.708
Gross.

05:04.791 --> 05:07.708
Órale. Off you go
to prepare for the coronation.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.708
-You three smell like--
-Like victory!

05:13.875 --> 05:16.041
-Vamos. Off to the baths.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.958
Maya's coronation cannot be delayed.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.375
There's still time.

05:21.458 --> 05:24.916
-And I know just who can bring her back.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.666
Huh?

05:34.458 --> 05:35.750
Chiapa, por favor!

05:35.833 --> 05:38.583
-You are a battle cat. Act like one.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.291
Get Maya back here
as soon as possible, boy.

05:43.791 --> 05:44.708
Ay.

05:44.791 --> 05:47.333
I think you know
where that girl ran off to.

05:47.833 --> 05:52.416
-Ay, Maya. I just hope she's safe.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.625
This is going to be glorious!

06:02.708 --> 06:04.000
If I survive.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.083
Illegal Bare-Knuckle Fighting Pit fans,

06:07.166 --> 06:10.583
please give a hand
to the undisputed champion,

06:11.166 --> 06:14.208
Bear Killah!

06:17.666 --> 06:20.375
-Challenge!

06:21.083 --> 06:26.125
-Huh?
-Who dares challenge Bear Killah, man?

06:28.541 --> 06:30.500
I do.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.083
-Oh, yeah.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.958
I do!

06:37.500 --> 06:39.666
This is no place for a girl!

06:39.750 --> 06:42.291
Go home, little niña!

06:42.375 --> 06:44.875
Hey! You are not a man!

06:45.875 --> 06:48.041
Oh yeah. You can do this, Maya.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.916
-What's your name, girl?
-Eagle Foot!

06:52.000 --> 06:54.416
No, no, Claw. Claw's better.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.125
Eagle Claw!

07:02.916 --> 07:04.666
-Ooh!

07:04.750 --> 07:09.000
By the twitching of our ears,
a new challenger appears.

07:13.083 --> 07:16.041
You proved your bravery, girl. Stand down.

07:16.125 --> 07:19.625
It's such a great honor to fight you,
Mr. Bear Killah!

07:21.458 --> 07:27.916
Whoever's the least dead at the end
gets the gold prize of… gold!

07:29.125 --> 07:30.291
Fight!

07:30.875 --> 07:33.166
Oh! I see what you're doing.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.708
Triple Fist of Destruction.
It's a classic!

07:36.791 --> 07:39.333
Triple Fist of Destruction!

07:39.416 --> 07:41.833
-Ooh, great combination, Bear Killah.

07:42.333 --> 07:46.250
Now, how about you taste some Eagle Punch!

07:46.333 --> 07:47.208
Ooh!

07:54.500 --> 07:55.958
I liked that one, man.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.125
Ooh! Oh, I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment?

08:03.208 --> 08:05.916
Check out this Eagle Claw Kick!

08:07.500 --> 08:10.125
-Eagle Claw!
-Oh, are you all right?

08:10.208 --> 08:11.541
Is it o-- Huh?

08:12.333 --> 08:16.000
The Bear cannot stand
before this mighty Eagle warrior!

08:16.083 --> 08:17.375
Eagle Claw!

08:24.250 --> 08:25.333
Mighty Eagle Flip!

08:25.416 --> 08:27.583
-Oh!

08:27.666 --> 08:28.625
Ooh!

08:28.708 --> 08:32.250
And now, the Teca Family

08:32.333 --> 08:34.416
-Elbow!

08:38.166 --> 08:40.125
Oh my gods.

08:40.208 --> 08:43.458
I think I beat Bear Killah!

08:43.541 --> 08:44.916
I won!

08:45.625 --> 08:48.625
-Eagle Claw! Eagle Claw!

08:48.708 --> 08:51.583
-Eagle Claw!

09:01.208 --> 09:03.625
This little eagle is not ready.

09:04.416 --> 09:07.250
-Huh?
-Eagle Killah!

09:09.041 --> 09:10.250
-Ah!

09:11.250 --> 09:13.625
-The Eagle is done!
-Oh!

09:13.708 --> 09:16.250
The Bear has won!

09:16.333 --> 09:17.791
Call it, ref man.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.291
-Stay down,

09:20.375 --> 09:23.041
or I have to break the rest of you, girl.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.000
Do you give up, Eagle Claw?

09:25.083 --> 09:27.125
Eagle Claw!

09:28.333 --> 09:30.250
Eagle Claw!

09:31.750 --> 09:33.250
-Huh?

09:35.791 --> 09:38.333
The Mighty Eagle is not done!

10:02.625 --> 10:04.875
Ay, for the gods' sake, Maya!

10:05.750 --> 10:08.833
-This is how you found her, Chiapa?

10:08.916 --> 10:12.166
-I'm sure she'll be fine.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.583
And what about
her dislocated shoulder? Hm?

10:14.666 --> 10:16.416
Oh! Uh…

10:16.500 --> 10:18.208
We wait for the healers?

10:23.416 --> 10:26.000
I didn't sneak out
to the fighting pits, I swear!

10:26.083 --> 10:28.833
Ay, Maya,
we were so worried about you.

10:28.916 --> 10:31.041
You could have died in that ring!

10:31.125 --> 10:33.708
Ho, ho, ho!
Please tell me you won.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.250
Oh, Mama, I was trying--

10:38.333 --> 10:41.791
You know, I was trying to win
that gold for the orphanage.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.416
Don't use those kids as an excuse.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.541
You were fighting
for nothing more than glory.

10:46.625 --> 10:50.041
-There's nothing sweeter than glory!

10:52.750 --> 10:57.125
Which is not
the right thing to think.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.625
Obviously.

11:01.708 --> 11:05.500
Mija, I've dreamt of your coronation
for 15 years.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.333
I don't want to be like you.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.708
A… A diplomat who does nothing
but sit around talking

11:10.791 --> 11:14.000
while the warriors
get to have epic adventures.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.625
Is that what you think I do?

11:17.208 --> 11:20.166
-Um, yeah.
-Maya, respect your mother.

11:20.708 --> 11:23.125
Mama, what happened to you?

11:23.208 --> 11:26.416
You were a warrior once.
You trained me to fight.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.166
So you could protect yourself,
not fight in the pits!

11:30.250 --> 11:33.458
It's the closest thing
I'll ever get to being--

11:33.541 --> 11:36.625
To be a-- a true Eagle Warrior.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.291
It's not fair that my brothers
get to go on epic quests,

11:39.375 --> 11:42.541
but I have to stay cooped up
in a palace because…

11:42.625 --> 11:45.000
…because I'm a princess.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.750
Ay, mija, it's not because
you're a princess.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.625
It's because your brothers
are the jaguars from the prophecy.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.291
Ugh! "The prophecy."

11:54.375 --> 11:56.416
A Great Eagle King, me,

11:56.500 --> 11:59.416
and his three jaguar sons, your brothers,

11:59.500 --> 12:05.041
would one day battle the dark gods
to save the world of man.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.208
Dun, dun, dun!

12:07.916 --> 12:11.083
And what if the Great Prophecy
was just a made-up story?

12:11.166 --> 12:13.083
Maya!

12:13.166 --> 12:16.333
-Papa, what if the gods don't even exist?

12:17.541 --> 12:18.375
Enough!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.125
Come on, mijos.

12:28.208 --> 12:31.875
Being a leader
is more than just fighting.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.791
It's about sacrifice.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.583
It's just not fair!

12:36.666 --> 12:40.666
No more of this Eagle Warrior nonsense.
Look at me, niña.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.083
Maya will never fight again.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.541
I hate you.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.166
I wish you weren't my mother.

13:03.333 --> 13:06.875
-Mama, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
-Maid, take Maya to my dressing room.

13:07.875 --> 13:10.125
Do what you must
to make her look like a princess.

13:15.750 --> 13:19.333
-You're new, aren't you?
-Yes, my lady.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.500
Hey, that's my favorite melody.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.541
Mine too.

13:31.250 --> 13:37.375
Some say it was here before the world
and will remain after it ends.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.291
Pardon me
for speaking out of turn, my lady,

13:41.375 --> 13:45.958
but it's clear your parents love you
to the sun and back.

13:46.041 --> 13:48.000
The gods have blessed you all.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.291
I guess.

13:49.958 --> 13:52.916
Tu mamá only wants what's best for you.

13:54.541 --> 13:58.916
I shouldn't have said that to her.
It's just, I don't wanna be a diplomat.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.375
If they would only give me a chance…

14:01.458 --> 14:04.750
…I could be a great Eagle Warrior.

14:04.833 --> 14:08.250
Maya, the queen has fought many battles.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.583
Maybe you should listen to her wisdom.

14:10.666 --> 14:11.875
Oh, who asked you?

14:12.791 --> 14:14.458
Niña!

14:14.541 --> 14:17.458
I'm so sorry, my queen.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.041
Hold on. No, no, no. I'm sorry, I…

14:24.583 --> 14:28.166
-Can this day be any worse?

14:38.833 --> 14:42.875
Teca! Teca! Teca! Teca!

14:42.958 --> 14:47.958
-Teca! Teca! Teca! Teca! Teca! Teca!

14:48.958 --> 14:54.625
Behold, mi amor, the other kingdoms
have all come to honor our daughter.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.583
This is even better than I dreamt.

14:58.666 --> 15:02.166
Look, look! The Gran Bruja
and the Wizard Council is here.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.583
Zapote, the air doesn't feel right.

15:12.666 --> 15:16.291
-Sensing a great darkness around us.

15:16.375 --> 15:19.416
Ugh, this again.
"Oh no! A great darkness."

15:19.500 --> 15:22.916
"Oh, ho, ho, ho!"
"I'm sensing disturbances in the forces!"

15:23.541 --> 15:24.666
So tired.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.250
-Ribbit.

15:27.333 --> 15:32.250
Oh! And the King and the Princess
of the Barbarians actually showed up!

15:38.250 --> 15:40.958
Barbarian King is hungry.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.166
Ay, Papa, we just ate!

15:43.250 --> 15:46.666
-Does daughter want king to starve?

15:48.333 --> 15:52.166
By the gods!
The Jungle Lands' Widdle Queen is here!

15:52.250 --> 15:53.750
Did you say Widdle Queen?

15:53.833 --> 15:57.791
Yeah, 'cause she's so little and cute.
She's the Widdle Queen.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.916
It's-- It's the Widow Queen.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.208
Yeah, because all the men around her…

16:02.291 --> 16:04.750
-…die mysteriously.

16:04.833 --> 16:08.375
Look, Fabiola. The Teca princess
will be crowned right there.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.708
And we get a front-row seat.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.958
Crown the Teca princess now!

16:16.041 --> 16:18.541
-So we can food!
-Ay, Papa!

16:22.500 --> 16:27.666
In the name of all the gods,
I present to you our daughter,

16:28.541 --> 16:30.166
-Maya!

16:33.833 --> 16:35.666
Yes, I know.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.666
Perhaps Mama is right.

16:40.125 --> 16:45.416
It's just, my whole life's about to change
and there's nothing I can do about it.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.083
Thanks for listening, Chiapa.

16:54.458 --> 16:59.125
All right. No more warrior.
I'm a diplomat for my kingdom.

17:05.166 --> 17:06.000
Here we go.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.375
Oh!

17:08.458 --> 17:09.333
She looks--

17:09.416 --> 17:10.833
-Like a real--
-Princess.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.583
-Ow!

17:14.833 --> 17:16.708
-Dang it.
-Maya! Are you okay?

17:16.791 --> 17:19.333
-Can we help you?
-Oh, no. Gracias.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.041
I got this.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.875
-Go, Maya.

17:39.083 --> 17:45.916
Lo, a new day has begun.
Princess Maya will be the sun!

17:53.416 --> 17:56.000
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

18:05.083 --> 18:06.708
Oh no!

18:07.375 --> 18:09.875
Fly away! Fly away! Fly away!

18:13.791 --> 18:16.458
Are you ready to carry
the weight of the crown, mija?

18:18.125 --> 18:20.208
If it is to be, it is up to me.

18:30.708 --> 18:33.458
-Ay, Fabiola, coming here was a mistake.

18:33.541 --> 18:36.541
See, Zapote? I knew something was wrong.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.000
Oh, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

18:39.083 --> 18:43.208
-Ribbit!
-Ooh! Maybe we do the fightings today!

18:52.000 --> 18:56.583
Teca!
Teca! Teca! Teca! Teca!

19:10.833 --> 19:14.000
Can this be?
The gods have sent their own emissary?

19:14.083 --> 19:15.500
The prophecy…

19:15.583 --> 19:17.791
…it is upon us.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.416
For Teca!

19:32.958 --> 19:35.500
-Oh, get behind us.
-But--

19:35.583 --> 19:37.333
Get behind us, Maya.

19:37.416 --> 19:38.375
I--

19:39.916 --> 19:42.083
Great King and Queen of Teca!

19:42.875 --> 19:44.625
Allow me to introduce myself.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.041
I am Zatz, the Prince of Bats.

19:51.166 --> 19:54.458
-I am but an emissary for Lord Mictlan.

19:56.083 --> 20:00.083
Why are you here now?
We have done nothing but honor the gods.

20:01.208 --> 20:05.541
Please, allow me to escort
the honorable Princess Maya

20:05.625 --> 20:07.875
to her rightful kingdom in the underworld.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.833
My rightful kingdom?

20:10.416 --> 20:15.250
And once in the underworld,
Princess Maya will be sacrificed.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.000
Sacrificed?

20:22.833 --> 20:25.125
-Alas, Lady Micte,

20:25.208 --> 20:29.583
Maya's true mother,
shall welcome her to the endless death.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.125
True mother?

20:32.208 --> 20:36.041
-Mama, what is he saying?
-Everything will be all right, mija.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.791
Chiapa, stay to protect Maya.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.416
Jaguars, on my command, we move.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.791
Now, please allow me
to escort Princess Maya.

20:47.875 --> 20:52.458
I promise you,
no harm will come to anyone.

20:52.541 --> 20:56.708
But you resist,
and I swear you will all die.

20:57.791 --> 20:58.708
Don't look.

21:05.916 --> 21:10.541
In the name of Teca, attack!

21:20.916 --> 21:21.958
-Lance!
-Daggers!

21:22.041 --> 21:23.666
-Shield!

21:28.666 --> 21:30.583
I can defend our people too!

21:30.666 --> 21:33.500
Listen to me, Maya. It is not our place.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.625
Let your father and brothers handle this.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.916
You left me no choice.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.916
By the gods.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.666
-I can help!

22:09.791 --> 22:11.625
Boys, get the Bat Prince.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.250
-I'll take the stone giants.
-Got it!

22:15.333 --> 22:17.083
Behold the might of Teca!

22:17.708 --> 22:19.333
-Lance!
-Daggers!

22:19.416 --> 22:20.458
Shield!

22:27.250 --> 22:28.125
Oh!

22:28.208 --> 22:30.458
Ooh! Whoo, come and get some!

22:30.541 --> 22:32.333
Ooph! You missed me! Ay!

22:32.416 --> 22:33.250
Missed again!

22:35.416 --> 22:36.416
Ooph!

22:38.666 --> 22:39.583
Eagle Claw!

22:39.666 --> 22:40.625
Huh?

22:41.916 --> 22:43.333
D'oh!

22:49.625 --> 22:51.625
Eagle Claw!

22:51.708 --> 22:52.541
Huh?

22:53.333 --> 22:55.458
Ooph!

22:55.541 --> 22:57.458
Too slow!

22:59.958 --> 23:01.833
-Aha!

23:01.916 --> 23:03.500
Taste the prophecy!

23:03.583 --> 23:05.958
-Taste it!

23:06.041 --> 23:08.833
I will not fight you.

23:08.916 --> 23:11.208
You'll never take our sister alive.

23:11.291 --> 23:15.708
A bat is no match
for three supermacho jaguars!

23:15.791 --> 23:19.166
Go back to whatever cave
you flew out of, vampiro.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.166
Know the Kingdom of Teca
does not fear the dark gods!

23:22.875 --> 23:24.916
-Even really handsome ones.

23:26.333 --> 23:29.750
My jaguar brothers and I
were born and trained our whole lives

23:29.833 --> 23:32.250
to fight scum like you!

23:33.250 --> 23:34.583
We are done here.

23:39.916 --> 23:41.041
Brothers!

23:42.583 --> 23:44.208
That prince is good.

23:45.166 --> 23:48.791
-Yeah. He fights pretty well too.
-Huh?

23:48.875 --> 23:51.166
Hey! Over here, stone face!

23:55.791 --> 23:57.291
Ooph!

23:57.375 --> 23:59.708
-Papa!

24:01.250 --> 24:02.791
-Ándale, Chiapa!

24:05.500 --> 24:08.875
Hey, niño vampiro,
is that all the gods sent?

24:10.708 --> 24:11.750
-Teca!
-Teca!

24:11.833 --> 24:15.208
That's impressive,
especially for an old guy.

24:15.291 --> 24:18.458
Perhaps the Teca prophecy is upon us.

24:19.708 --> 24:23.583
I will not fight you, King Teca.
It is clear you're hurt.

24:25.625 --> 24:28.166
Listen here, boy.

24:28.250 --> 24:31.541
You tell your gods
that if they want my daughter,

24:31.625 --> 24:37.750
they will have to rip her away
from my cold, dead arms.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.458
Am I understood, boy?

24:41.208 --> 24:42.291
Understood.

24:44.541 --> 24:47.166
-Papa! Are you okay?

24:47.250 --> 24:51.916
I assure you,
the god of war will not be pleased.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.625
Be well, Princess Maya.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.416
I'll see you soon.

25:04.208 --> 25:07.458
-But… the prophecy…

25:08.708 --> 25:11.083
Your hand, my love.

25:11.166 --> 25:13.666
Ah, I have another one just like it.

25:16.958 --> 25:18.958
-Did we win?
-My gods!

25:19.041 --> 25:21.791
-See how good family fight together?

25:21.875 --> 25:24.500
Teca princess
will be the end of her kingdom.

25:25.125 --> 25:25.958
What a shame.

25:26.708 --> 25:27.875
Bye-bye, Tecas.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.625
-This is madness!

25:31.708 --> 25:36.750
The god of war will be furious,
and it's all your fault, Princess Maya!

25:39.958 --> 25:41.583
Brothers and sisters!

25:41.666 --> 25:44.000
-This is war!

25:44.083 --> 25:46.458
-Now more than ever,

25:46.541 --> 25:49.416
we must stand together!

25:50.000 --> 25:53.458
I will lead us all to an epic victory!

25:57.166 --> 25:59.666
Will the alliance join us?

26:05.791 --> 26:07.333
-We fight!

26:08.583 --> 26:10.833
Ay. This is not our battle.

26:10.916 --> 26:12.750
We not fight!

26:13.458 --> 26:14.375
Ugh.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.541
Brothers and sisters,
you know we would fight for you.

26:23.625 --> 26:27.958
-At times like these, we must--
-You must fight for us!

26:28.041 --> 26:29.625
-Maya!

26:36.333 --> 26:38.250
This is not how we ask for help.

26:38.875 --> 26:42.166
Ah, we don't need
your help, cowards!

26:42.250 --> 26:43.958
-Ay…

26:44.041 --> 26:46.583
Ah! Easy, husband. Rest.

26:46.666 --> 26:50.541
-We'll figure something out, Papa.
-There's nothing to figure out.

26:51.416 --> 26:53.750
We're going to war with the gods.

26:53.833 --> 26:54.875
For you, Maya.

27:53.333 --> 27:54.500
Hmm…

28:04.666 --> 28:07.250
It is done, Lord Mictlan.

28:11.250 --> 28:14.083
Just as you planned, husband.

28:14.166 --> 28:15.000
And?

28:15.083 --> 28:19.208
All of the Teca army are marching
through the Endless Forest, my lord.

28:19.291 --> 28:23.333
I can already
taste their fear, mi amor.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.750
They do not know what they do.

28:30.833 --> 28:35.625
Your half-breed daughter, she will be
a delicious sacrifice, beloved.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.375
Anything for you, beloved.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.291
Perhaps showing the humans mercy--

28:42.375 --> 28:46.541
General Camazotz,
the only mercy in war is death.

28:51.791 --> 28:54.541
-And I shall be relentless…

28:55.166 --> 28:56.666
…in my mercy.

28:58.708 --> 29:00.625
Don't wait up, my darling.

29:00.708 --> 29:05.500
For tonight, I pay a visit
to an old acquaintance of yours.
