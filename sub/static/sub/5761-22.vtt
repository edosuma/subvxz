00:00.300 --> 00:04.100
Previously on "Ghost Whisperer"

00:04.700 --> 00:06.400
There were 5 signs this past year:

00:06.500 --> 00:09.700
the dead dove, the bee, the dead will
walk, the return of the forgotten.

00:09.800 --> 00:15.400
The only thing that hasn't happened
is death of a loved one.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.900
She's gonna be all right.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.500
Are you trying to tell me
something about my friend?

00:21.600 --> 00:23.900
All eyes will be on you.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.900
There's a better place for you.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.500
Gabriel...

00:35.606 --> 00:36.900
what are you saying?

00:37.004 --> 00:39.001
We're blocking the light...

00:39.103 --> 00:43.308
and soon, no one's gonna get through.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:52.901 --> 00:56.509
You have something I want.

01:01.709 --> 01:04.300
Do you know what it's like
to be obsessed, miss Gordon?

01:04.407 --> 01:06.700
So that you can't think,
you can't eat?

01:06.805 --> 01:08.000
I do.

01:08.105 --> 01:10.202
And these children do.
And I think soon, you will, too.

01:10.308 --> 01:11.701
Why am I here?

01:11.807 --> 01:14.301
Sorry about the drama,
my assistant called you.

01:14.405 --> 01:16.901
But I had to know that you'd
be willing to come to me.

01:17.005 --> 01:17.802
Meaning?

01:17.906 --> 01:22.303
Meaning that since the very mention of
the words May the 11th on the telephone
brought you here,

01:22.405 --> 01:25.502
I know we're both interested
in the same thing.

01:25.607 --> 01:28.302
I'm not gonna play word games
with you, mr...

01:28.407 --> 01:29.600
Clark.

01:29.705 --> 01:31.902
Ethan Clark.
Happy to meet you.

01:32.006 --> 01:34.100
Yeah. You obviously already
know my name.

01:34.206 --> 01:36.901
A byproduct of the aforementioned obsession.

01:37.006 --> 01:39.003
I don't want to play games
with you, either.

01:39.108 --> 01:40.300
Honestly.

01:40.408 --> 01:45.700
I just want to find out what you know
and tell you what I know.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.901
May the 11th, 2005.

01:49.106 --> 01:52.900
A ferry capsized in the Irish Sea.

01:53.006 --> 01:56.801
Young mr. Liam Fletcher
was on that ferry.

01:56.907 --> 01:59.603
He survived.

02:01.006 --> 02:06.701
The reason I'm so aware
of this accident is because my
wife Dana was also on that ferry.

02:06.806 --> 02:08.800
She did not survive.

02:08.907 --> 02:12.400
In fact, no one else did.

02:12.808 --> 02:16.101
A year later, May the 11th, 2006,

02:16.205 --> 02:18.900
I came down to my morning paper
and read about a plane crash

02:19.006 --> 02:22.001
just outside a little town of Grandview.

02:22.105 --> 02:24.803
Sent me thinking about May the 11th.

02:24.908 --> 02:27.201
And I started looking
at other May the 11ths.

02:27.306 --> 02:30.100
Maybe you have, too.

02:30.206 --> 02:33.100
May 11,2004...

02:35.108 --> 02:37.702
Subway tunnel caved in in Moscow.

02:37.806 --> 02:41.601
Miraculously survived by Elena Petrova.

02:41.705 --> 02:44.803
May the 11th, 2003.

02:45.106 --> 02:48.702
Bridge collapsed in Italy.

02:56.205 --> 02:59.600
Sole survivor, Stefano Donato.

02:59.705 --> 03:02.800
How'd you know about these accidents?

03:02.908 --> 03:04.401
It's complicated.

03:04.507 --> 03:07.203
Yes, it is.

03:10.308 --> 03:12.100
What does all of this
have to do with me?

03:12.205 --> 03:13.202
I don't know.

03:13.306 --> 03:16.201
But what I do know is that everything
leads back to you, Melinda.

03:16.306 --> 03:18.701
- May I call you Melinda?
- Not yet.

03:18.808 --> 03:20.500
Right.

03:20.605 --> 03:24.200
I've spent the last year traveling
the world researching the accidents

03:24.306 --> 03:26.701
and finding these children.

03:26.808 --> 03:30.601
Each one of them, working on
a little part of this puzzle.

03:30.708 --> 03:33.800
Each one of them obsessed with you.

03:33.908 --> 03:35.101
Why?

03:35.208 --> 03:37.703
Well, that's where it gets interesting.

03:37.805 --> 03:41.803
Karen, would you bring in Stefano?

03:42.205 --> 03:44.800
Stefano...

03:48.807 --> 03:51.303
One day...

03:51.405 --> 03:53.301
I died.

03:53.406 --> 03:56.202
And I saw you.

04:02.605 --> 04:04.900
I need to know what the hell
is going on here.

04:05.008 --> 04:07.101
They don't seem like
accidents, do they?

04:07.208 --> 04:10.102
4 events, same date, a year apart.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.403
What's the pattern?
What are they a part of?

04:13.506 --> 04:15.602
I've been trying to figure that out, too.

04:15.706 --> 04:17.399
If there's something bigger going on,

04:17.505 --> 04:19.101
I want to know what.

04:19.207 --> 04:22.103
I mean, I've been led to you
for a reason, don't you think?

04:22.206 --> 04:23.703
We should work together.

04:23.808 --> 04:25.303
How?

04:25.408 --> 04:28.601
There's one child survivor
I haven't been able to locate.

04:28.707 --> 04:31.003
The little girl who was
in the plane crash.

04:31.108 --> 04:34.103
Kristen Filbert.

04:39.408 --> 04:43.103
She was pulled from a car
that got crushed under the plane.

04:43.206 --> 04:45.402
Her mom died trying to protect her.

04:45.506 --> 04:50.001
Well, I think somewhere she's making
something or drawing something.

04:50.106 --> 04:52.003
I mean, maybe the picture
isn't complete.

04:52.108 --> 04:55.101
Maybe she has the answer.

04:55.206 --> 04:59.102
Do you think you could find her?

05:27.406 --> 05:31.101
EPISODE 2x22
"The Gathering"

05:33.007 --> 05:34.202
This guy is filthy rich.

05:34.308 --> 05:36.401
He actually owns the ferry company
from the accident,

05:36.508 --> 05:39.002
but that's just a part of it.
He owns an airline, a shipping company

05:39.108 --> 05:40.900
and 3 quarters of a soccer team.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.102
What, he couldn't afford
the other quarter?

05:43.207 --> 05:45.302
You should have seen those kids' faces.

05:45.407 --> 05:47.301
They looked at me like
they already knew me.

05:47.408 --> 05:49.100
I don't get this guy.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.802
I mean, I don't know
what his endgame is.

05:51.905 --> 05:53.702
- Does he know what you can do?
- I didn't tell him,

05:53.806 --> 05:55.100
and I don't know if I will.

05:55.205 --> 05:58.400
He lost his wife on that ferry,
and I think researching the stuff

05:58.506 --> 06:02.000
just makes him feel
connected to her somehow.

06:02.108 --> 06:03.803
Yeah, but can you trust him?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.900
I don't know that, either.

06:06.008 --> 06:08.002
But, look, he brought these kids here.
I mean,

06:08.105 --> 06:11.602
I owe it to them to find out what
it is they're going through and why.

06:11.706 --> 06:14.402
This doesn't make sense to me,
and I don't think it makes sense
to you, either,

06:14.507 --> 06:16.102
and it's starting to give me the creeps,

06:16.208 --> 06:20.303
so, will you please let me
take you away from here?

06:20.407 --> 06:22.100
At least till after the 11th?

06:22.208 --> 06:23.302
I would love that.

06:23.407 --> 06:28.200
But if this is about me, then it's
gonna follow me wherever I go.

06:28.308 --> 06:31.300
And I need to see it through here.

06:31.405 --> 06:32.802
How can I help you?

06:32.908 --> 06:34.603
Be careful.

06:34.706 --> 06:37.303
Be aware of everything around you.

06:37.407 --> 06:39.403
And we'll get through it.

06:39.507 --> 06:40.802
And, call me...

06:40.906 --> 06:44.203
like a million times.

06:44.406 --> 06:46.803
I will.

07:44.906 --> 07:46.901
What is this?

07:47.005 --> 07:49.603
We used to be strong and many.

07:49.707 --> 07:52.002
Now we're few.

07:52.108 --> 07:54.802
There are more dark spirits now.

07:54.906 --> 07:58.902
They get stronger, we get weaker.

08:02.807 --> 08:06.703
You have to protect
the ones who are left.

08:06.805 --> 08:09.903
You fail, we fail.

08:19.108 --> 08:20.900
So do you think is means
that Gabriel is back?

08:21.008 --> 08:22.802
I don't know who else
she could be talking about.

08:22.907 --> 08:24.602
Well, it doesn't necessarily
mean Grandview, right?

08:24.708 --> 08:27.602
I mean, this ghost could have been in
Zimbabwe yesterday, for all we know.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.800
No, I'm pretty sure that this ghost
has been making the same rounds
since she died.

08:30.908 --> 08:33.703
Where is your desk and stuff?

08:33.806 --> 08:37.000
Oh, well, it seems that I failed
to inform the supply manager

08:37.106 --> 08:38.700
that I postponed my sabbatical.

08:38.804 --> 08:40.203
So they took all your furniture?

08:40.307 --> 08:42.302
An oversight. Heads will roll.

08:42.405 --> 08:44.302
What I'd really like to know is
where have you been?

08:44.408 --> 08:45.500
Why haven't you called me sooner?

08:45.605 --> 08:47.402
I mean, we have children with
near-death experiences,

08:47.505 --> 08:50.603
psychic visions, you have a prophet
ghost with the candle brigade.

08:50.706 --> 08:51.801
Is your dialing finger broken?

08:51.907 --> 08:53.800
Sorry. Things have been
happening very fast.

08:53.904 --> 08:57.691
Well, you'll be very happy to know
that the lack of a desk or a chair
with wheels hasn't stopped me

08:57.803 --> 09:01.508
from trying to figure out
what is going to happen on May 11th.

09:01.601 --> 09:04.809
See, it all has to do with
a world out of balance,

09:04.909 --> 09:07.503
a world where chaos rules,

09:07.605 --> 09:09.702
which is what prophet ghost
keeps telling us,

09:09.806 --> 09:11.103
and what we know Gabriel wants.

09:11.205 --> 09:14.003
From the fall of the Roman Empire
to the Civil War,

09:14.107 --> 09:16.900
it all starts with a single,
individual trigger.

09:17.008 --> 09:19.801
Well, I don't think that the prophet
ghost is talking about an apocalypse.

09:19.907 --> 09:23.303
I think she's talking about these kids.
They've been touched by the light,

09:23.408 --> 09:24.302
their changed.

09:24.408 --> 09:26.401
Well, that's my point exactly.
All these giant events start

09:26.506 --> 09:28.101
with a single, individual trigger.

09:28.206 --> 09:31.401
I mean, the assassination of Julius
Caesar caused 15 years of Civil War

09:31.506 --> 09:33.201
and the eventual fall of Rome.

09:33.308 --> 09:35.401
The election of Abraham Lincoln
split this country in two.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.202
That's something we're still not over.

09:37.306 --> 09:41.300
All these giant disasters can be
traced back to the smallest fuse.

09:41.406 --> 09:45.303
So the fifth accident that you and I
think is gonna happen on May 11th

09:45.408 --> 09:47.300
may actually be disguised
as something small?

09:47.405 --> 09:49.000
But it will have a huge effect
on the world.

09:49.108 --> 09:52.603
It might be a misfortune suffered
by a few very special children,

09:52.708 --> 09:54.301
children that are a threat
to the dark side.

09:54.405 --> 09:55.802
Well, there's still one out there.

09:55.908 --> 09:58.003
The little girl that Jim pulled
from the plane crash.

09:58.105 --> 10:00.702
Well, we have to find her
if she has a piece of this puzzle.

10:00.805 --> 10:03.202
We have to figure out what's going to happen on May 11th.

10:03.305 --> 10:05.402
We have less than one week to find her.

10:05.506 --> 10:10.102
If I had a desk,
I'd pound it for emphasis.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.502
Something I can help you with?

10:24.608 --> 10:27.302
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for someone.

10:27.406 --> 10:30.603
Don't like to see people
messing around with the mailboxes.

10:30.706 --> 10:32.202
Neither do I.

10:32.308 --> 10:36.102
I was just looking for a man,
Charlie Filbert.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.901
This... it was the last address
I had for him, so...

10:39.008 --> 10:40.501
Long gone.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.202
- Excuse me?
- About 6 months ago.

10:42.305 --> 10:45.001
Her and her dad just moved out.

10:45.108 --> 10:47.203
Well, did they leave
a forwarding address?

10:47.306 --> 10:50.903
I wouldn't know about that.

10:55.808 --> 10:57.402
I hope I'll see you again.

10:57.505 --> 10:59.702
You're a lot nicer than the other one.

10:59.805 --> 11:01.101
What other one?

11:01.205 --> 11:06.702
- Gotta finish my rounds.
- No, wait, was his name Gabriel?

11:11.407 --> 11:12.703
Now you know everything.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.002
You've been given 5 signs,
and they're all pointing

11:15.107 --> 11:18.203
to something happening on May 11th?

11:18.308 --> 11:20.903
There's this sign that
I keep getting warned about.

11:21.006 --> 11:23.703
It's the only thing that hasn't
happened yet, death of a loved one.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.602
But the warning keeps getting stronger.

11:26.708 --> 11:29.602
And you still think this has
something to do with me?

11:29.707 --> 11:31.602
I don't know. It may be you,
it may be Jim,

11:31.707 --> 11:34.701
but it's definitely something
I have to pay attention to, and

11:34.805 --> 11:37.102
now you really think I'm insane.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.400
I think you're my friend.

11:39.505 --> 11:42.602
And people come into each
other's lives for a reason.

11:42.708 --> 11:44.600
Maybe I'm supposed to learn something.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.701
Maybe you are.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.600
But whatever it is, I...

11:49.706 --> 11:52.102
I am here for you.

11:52.207 --> 11:56.403
I can't tell you how much
that means to me.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.300
And, uh...

11:58.408 --> 12:01.303
you are a little insane.

12:01.408 --> 12:03.100
But that is what I love about you.

12:03.206 --> 12:05.900
Thanks. I think.

12:06.006 --> 12:08.302
So, how can I help?

12:08.406 --> 12:10.302
I'm looking for Kristen Filbert,

12:10.405 --> 12:12.101
the little girl who survived
the plane crash.

12:12.208 --> 12:15.000
She and her father moved away a few
months ago, and I don't know where.

12:15.108 --> 12:17.400
Did you check her middle school?

12:17.506 --> 12:18.203
No.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.403
Just because somebody moves
doesn't mean they change schools.

12:20.505 --> 12:22.202
And even if they did,
maybe they'll be willing

12:22.305 --> 12:26.103
to tell you where they sent the records.

12:26.206 --> 12:27.603
I miss Kristen.

12:27.707 --> 12:29.403
She was a smart kid,
always did her work,

12:29.508 --> 12:31.702
got along with everyone.

12:31.808 --> 12:33.701
Can you tell me
where you sent her records?

12:33.808 --> 12:36.000
Oh, well, we didn't.
We just gave them to her dad.

12:36.105 --> 12:38.200
He said he wanted to home school her,

12:38.305 --> 12:40.402
that he had just found a little
house up in Sunset Park.

12:40.508 --> 12:43.703
Do you know why?
I mean, why he took her away?

12:43.806 --> 12:47.400
She just never really came back
all the way after she lost her mother.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.803
She was withdrawn, she barely spoke.

12:49.906 --> 12:52.401
- Did she draw a lot?
- Yeah.

12:52.507 --> 12:56.403
She was always working on something,
but she wouldn't show anyone.

12:56.505 --> 13:01.701
Did she leave anything behind,
like a drawing or anything?

13:01.808 --> 13:05.603
You know, there was one thing.

13:06.405 --> 13:08.400
There was an english assignment I gave,

13:08.505 --> 13:11.603
I asked them to write down
the first thing they thought of
when they woke up in the morning,

13:11.705 --> 13:16.300
and the last thought they had
before they went to sleep.

13:16.406 --> 13:21.902
I haven't been able to get
Kristen's answer out of my mind.

13:44.106 --> 13:46.702
Melinda...

13:49.106 --> 13:51.701
Melinda...

13:56.307 --> 13:58.901
Melinda...

14:14.307 --> 14:15.803
Hi, grandma!

14:15.907 --> 14:19.401
It is so good to see you!

14:19.807 --> 14:22.401
- Am I dreaming?
- Sure.

14:22.605 --> 14:26.800
That's the only way
I can come to you now.

14:26.905 --> 14:29.703
I always liked watching you
hang the laundry.

14:29.806 --> 14:31.203
I know.

14:31.307 --> 14:33.202
Made you feel safe.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.001
What is it like
where you are, grandma?

14:36.105 --> 14:39.100
Well, that doesn't matter right now.

14:39.208 --> 14:43.300
There are things that you have
to do here, honey, important things.

14:43.406 --> 14:48.900
You have to be ready for what's coming,
and you can't doubt yourself.

14:49.006 --> 14:53.600
I want to be ready, but...
I don't know how.

14:54.107 --> 14:57.101
They're gonna come for you, honey.

14:57.205 --> 14:59.701
You may not even recognize them.

14:59.808 --> 15:04.903
Well, they may come as something
as normal as the weather.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.703
Just don't be afraid.

15:07.807 --> 15:11.900
If you are, you'll lose everything.

15:12.805 --> 15:16.502
You must protect the balance.

15:33.906 --> 15:36.403
Grandma?

15:43.107 --> 15:46.602
I'm really sorry to barge in on you
like this. I know it's been a while.

15:46.706 --> 15:48.803
It isn't that I'm not happy
to see you, I am.

15:48.908 --> 15:52.201
It's just, you know, I'm trying
to get Grandview out of my head.

15:52.307 --> 15:53.703
And Kristen's...

15:53.808 --> 15:55.603
She's had a rough time, hasn't she?

15:55.705 --> 15:58.400
Well, she was ok until
she got back from the hospital,

15:58.507 --> 16:01.203
started having dreams.

16:01.305 --> 16:05.301
Didn't want to talk about it.
She started crying at night,
crying for her mother.

16:05.405 --> 16:11.703
You know, I try and comfort her,
and sometimes I lose it, too, you know?

16:12.707 --> 16:16.401
Well, yeah, we both just...
we just miss her a lot.

16:16.506 --> 16:17.401
Did moving help?

16:17.506 --> 16:20.600
Oh, no. Not really.

16:21.006 --> 16:23.200
Not yet, anyhow.

16:23.305 --> 16:26.703
Now, you said there were other kids
who were going through the same thing?

16:26.806 --> 16:32.100
Kids who have survived disasters
and near-death experiences.

16:32.207 --> 16:34.002
I want her to come to Grandview.

16:34.105 --> 16:37.003
I really feel like it would help everyone
if she could just meet these kids.

16:37.105 --> 16:39.300
No way. I'm sorry.

16:39.406 --> 16:40.603
I know how you feel.

16:40.707 --> 16:44.700
Ok? I really do, but I wouldn't ask
unless I thought it was really important.

16:44.808 --> 16:48.003
Why is it important?

16:49.006 --> 16:52.402
I think this could be a part
of something much bigger.

16:52.505 --> 16:57.703
And I feel like she and these kids
should be together right now.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.200
I'm sorry.

17:00.305 --> 17:03.701
It's just not a good time.

17:03.807 --> 17:08.300
Well, thanks for thinking
about it anyway.

17:08.808 --> 17:10.202
call me,

17:10.307 --> 17:15.502
you know, if you change your mind
or if you just want to talk.

17:15.605 --> 17:19.303
Her teacher said that she was drawing
a lot and didn't to show anyone.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.800
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

17:24.007 --> 17:29.400
She started doing these right after
she came home from the hospital.

17:29.505 --> 17:31.002
Could I keep this one?

17:31.106 --> 17:33.101
There are a couple hundred
just like it upstairs.

17:33.205 --> 17:36.601
I guess I can spare one.

17:37.308 --> 17:41.102
I think I've seen this before.

18:04.505 --> 18:07.203
Ok, this is what Kristen drew.

18:07.308 --> 18:08.903
And this...

18:09.005 --> 18:11.202
is the composite

18:11.306 --> 18:15.301
that Liam, Stefano and Elena did.

18:15.708 --> 18:18.903
Ok? Now, watch this.

18:19.905 --> 18:22.703
Ok. Follow me.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.101
It was right under our noses
the whole time.

18:52.205 --> 18:57.100
Dedication and midnight lantern walk
on may 11th to honor the 230 victims

18:57.205 --> 18:59.002
of the crash of flight 395.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.201
I don't exactly understand.
What does this tell us?

19:02.306 --> 19:06.800
Kristen's painting is almost an exact
match to the new memorial
at the plane crash site.

19:06.908 --> 19:10.403
It also matches the drawings
that the other kids have been doing.

19:10.506 --> 19:11.702
Means whatever's going to happen,

19:11.808 --> 19:13.502
it's probably going to happen
at the crash site.

19:13.605 --> 19:16.400
That's what the kids have been trying
to tell us without them realizing it.

19:16.508 --> 19:20.701
But when you say "whatever's going
to happen", what do you mean?

19:20.808 --> 19:23.102
We've been tracking this
for quite some time,

19:23.205 --> 19:27.301
and Melinda and both feel that the
number five plays heavily into this.

19:27.408 --> 19:30.700
We believe that the fifth accident
is going to happen this May 11th.

19:30.805 --> 19:32.803
- In 4 days?
- Yes.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.000
Here in Grandview?

19:34.105 --> 19:36.003
Well, so it seems.

19:36.106 --> 19:40.100
But it's not as important where as to
whom, and right now it's about Melinda.

19:40.207 --> 19:44.503
Ok, there is something that you need
to know about me.

19:44.607 --> 19:46.102
Melinda...

19:46.208 --> 19:48.201
can see ghosts.

19:48.306 --> 19:53.100
She talks to ghosts,
she hangs out with ghosts.

19:53.408 --> 19:57.703
All right.

19:58.206 --> 20:00.703
So all this is real?

20:00.806 --> 20:02.301
Pretty much.

20:02.406 --> 20:03.700
How do you do it?

20:03.908 --> 20:07.201
I've been shown visions from a spirit,
and told certain things.

20:07.305 --> 20:10.600
What's really important is that
we focus on this dedication.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.200
But how are the kids involved?

20:12.307 --> 20:13.600
Let's not find out.

20:13.707 --> 20:15.601
I'm gonna talk to somebody
about cancelling the ceremony,

20:15.706 --> 20:20.303
or at least postponing it
until we can find out more.

20:20.408 --> 20:23.702
This ability you have,
do you see spirits clearly?

20:23.806 --> 20:27.903
- Can you tell one from the other?
- Yeah.

20:28.007 --> 20:29.802
Are there any around me?

20:29.908 --> 20:32.503
You mean your wife?

20:32.608 --> 20:35.400
No. No, there's no one around you.

20:35.508 --> 20:37.003
But that probably means
she crossed over.

20:37.106 --> 20:40.901
So that's a really good thing.

20:41.706 --> 20:44.801
There's something that you're
not telling me about her...

20:44.906 --> 20:47.300
about how she died.

20:47.408 --> 20:50.403
I laughed at her.

20:51.508 --> 20:55.000
She believed she was psychic
ever since she was a little girl.

20:55.105 --> 20:57.302
And did you believe that she was?

20:57.405 --> 21:00.102
No. I didn't believe any of that.

21:00.205 --> 21:04.903
I enjoy teasing her,
perhaps little too much.

21:08.006 --> 21:11.501
We planned to go to Dublin
on the ferry.

21:11.606 --> 21:14.502
A night before she said
she had a bad feeling.

21:14.605 --> 21:19.103
She said she had a vision,
and she ask me to cancel the trip.

21:19.208 --> 21:22.600
Again I laughed at her.

21:22.708 --> 21:27.200
Our plan was to meet on the ferry.
I was delayed on the conference call.

21:27.306 --> 21:29.502
I didn't notice.

21:29.606 --> 21:32.201
She got on the ferry,
I didn't,

21:32.307 --> 21:34.102
and as it turns out,

21:34.205 --> 21:36.400
she was right to have had
a bad feeling.

21:36.507 --> 21:40.203
She was right to have asked me
to cancel.

21:40.305 --> 21:43.201
And I lost her.

21:55.306 --> 21:57.300
It's not a good time.

21:57.408 --> 21:58.701
Are you the one that can help me?

21:58.805 --> 22:03.302
Yes. But it is really
not a good time, ok?

22:05.408 --> 22:06.900
I'm scared.

22:07.007 --> 22:10.000
- I don't know what to do.
- Ok, look, just hang in there,

22:10.107 --> 22:13.402
all right? And I'll...

22:22.608 --> 22:24.303
Oh, Alex!

22:24.405 --> 22:26.000
Please, don't call me Alex in public.

22:26.106 --> 22:28.502
Sorry, mayor Milio,
can I have a minute?

22:28.605 --> 22:29.400
Bad day.

22:29.508 --> 22:31.200
My town council meeting ran late.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.201
I have a school vote and a clean up
committee rally.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.803
Look, I really need you to cancel
the dedication ceremony.

22:35.905 --> 22:36.603
Why?

22:36.707 --> 22:38.501
Well, it's a little hard to explain.

22:38.606 --> 22:41.403
But I just get this feeling that
something bad may happen there.

22:41.508 --> 22:43.801
Look, can you just postpone it
until I can get all this figured out?

22:43.905 --> 22:45.001
Get what figured out?

22:45.105 --> 22:49.102
Well, I don't exactly know yet, but
I do know there could be some danger.

22:49.205 --> 22:50.503
Look,

22:50.605 --> 22:52.500
we're going to have plenty of security.

22:52.605 --> 22:56.001
Everything will be fine.

23:14.607 --> 23:18.400
Delia!

23:24.707 --> 23:27.101
Delia!

24:03.607 --> 24:05.402
Delia, are you here?

24:05.507 --> 24:07.501
Hey. I was just gonna call you.

24:07.608 --> 24:08.701
Are you all right?

24:08.805 --> 24:11.003
It's been a day. A week.

24:11.105 --> 24:13.102
These streets are dangerous.

24:13.206 --> 24:15.601
There was someone who just...

24:15.705 --> 24:18.800
You have a visitor.

24:24.405 --> 24:27.102
Kristen, what are you...

24:27.206 --> 24:29.303
How did you get here?

24:29.406 --> 24:31.201
I took a bus.

24:31.306 --> 24:32.703
Please don't tell my dad.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.801
Sweetie, I have to tell your dad, ok?

24:35.906 --> 24:38.402
He must be crazy looking for you.

24:38.508 --> 24:40.101
Why did you come here?

24:40.205 --> 24:44.303
I heard you say that there are
other kids. Just like me.

24:44.407 --> 24:46.000
I want to meet them.

24:46.106 --> 24:47.801
I feel like I have to.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.300
Why?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.903
I don't know.

24:52.005 --> 24:54.901
I don't want to see
the things that I see.

24:55.006 --> 24:57.803
What do you see?

24:57.906 --> 25:01.300
I don't want to say it.

25:02.305 --> 25:05.202
It's too awful.

25:06.807 --> 25:09.000
Ok, well...

25:09.108 --> 25:14.201
I'll take you to see the others,
but only if your dad says that it's ok.

25:14.306 --> 25:18.200
It's a crazy thing that you did
by coming here, Kristen.

25:18.306 --> 25:22.002
But I'm really glad you did.

25:26.706 --> 25:28.901
Thank you, Charlie.

25:29.008 --> 25:30.601
She's ok.

25:30.708 --> 25:33.202
Just let her spend the day, ok?

25:33.306 --> 25:37.000
I think it could really help her.

25:37.106 --> 25:40.003
Yes, I will bring her back myself.

25:40.107 --> 25:41.402
Ok.

25:41.506 --> 25:44.602
I'll call you later.

25:44.707 --> 25:47.703
Melinda Gordon...

25:49.307 --> 25:51.700
Grazi.

25:56.008 --> 25:59.602
That's the only thing I know in Italian besides bene.

25:59.705 --> 26:01.700
Just going to the kitchen.

26:01.806 --> 26:04.300
Come on.

26:06.906 --> 26:08.901
Why does it feel like
we all know each other?

26:09.008 --> 26:14.101
Well, maybe because you've all
been through the same things.

26:14.206 --> 26:17.002
Look, I know that this
is hard for all of you.

26:17.106 --> 26:20.203
You're in a strange place
and you're scared.

26:20.305 --> 26:21.800
I see things.

26:21.905 --> 26:23.901
Things that haven't happened.

26:24.007 --> 26:26.400
We all do.

26:26.508 --> 26:29.302
People who have been through
what you've been through,

26:29.408 --> 26:33.000
people who die, even for
a short time and see the light,

26:33.105 --> 26:35.602
they always come back changed.

26:35.705 --> 26:38.302
They know things that
they didn't know before.

26:38.405 --> 26:40.600
And they can see things.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.200
I don't want to.

26:42.305 --> 26:44.603
I just want to be the way I was before.

26:44.707 --> 26:45.902
Me, too.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.601
I just want things to be
like it used to be.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.100
I know.

26:50.205 --> 26:53.803
You and I have both lost someone
we loved to that plane crash.

26:53.907 --> 27:00.503
And I wish all the time that things
could be as exactly as they were before.

27:01.908 --> 27:05.103
Look, I know what it's like
to be different...

27:05.206 --> 27:10.900
and to have people make you feel
like you're not quite right.

27:11.406 --> 27:15.202
But you just have to know that all
the things that make you different,

27:15.307 --> 27:17.303
all the things you've seen,

27:17.408 --> 27:20.001
all the things you feel,

27:20.108 --> 27:23.202
those are all things
that make you special.

27:23.305 --> 27:27.302
No matter what anybody else thinks.

27:27.407 --> 27:29.801
You may have been given a gift.

27:29.907 --> 27:35.100
A gift to be able to help
others, maybe even help you.

27:35.207 --> 27:39.602
Even if it doesn't always
feel like it's a gift.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.801
I showed them the drawing
of the memorial.

27:41.907 --> 27:44.200
They all feel as if
they've been there before,

27:44.306 --> 27:46.501
and they all feel as
if they'll be there again.

27:46.605 --> 27:49.701
Oh, I can't let this happen. I mean,
they're sensitives now, you know?

27:49.805 --> 27:51.902
They have some psychic ability,

27:52.005 --> 27:56.002
and that could make them a target, too.
We just can't take any chances.

27:56.107 --> 28:00.303
Well, it's good they're all together.

28:01.008 --> 28:05.500
- Was this your wife?
- Yes. That's Dana.

28:12.808 --> 28:17.101
I don't know why I haven't seen you
around your husband.

28:17.208 --> 28:20.103
Why are you ignoring him?

28:20.208 --> 28:23.401
I want to see Ethan.

28:23.608 --> 28:25.103
But I can't yet.

28:25.207 --> 28:27.402
Why?

28:27.906 --> 28:31.302
- I'm only here to help you.
- So then help me.

28:31.407 --> 28:35.301
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

28:37.607 --> 28:40.702
Is Ethan all right?

28:41.605 --> 28:43.702
He feels a lot of guilt

28:43.806 --> 28:47.201
about not believing
that you were psychic,

28:47.308 --> 28:51.002
letting you get on that ferry
and not canceling it.

28:51.106 --> 28:53.802
I think that's a big part
of why he's here.

28:53.906 --> 28:57.400
He has nothing to feel guilty about.

28:57.508 --> 29:01.301
Everything happened as it should.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.203
I know that now.

29:04.305 --> 29:07.401
Watch out for him.

29:07.608 --> 29:09.600
Don't let him lose himself.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.101
Tell him...

29:12.208 --> 29:15.602
I'll find my way to him.

29:16.705 --> 29:19.100
I will.

29:23.608 --> 29:28.302
Hey, Ethan, it's Melinda.
Please call me, it's really important.

29:28.408 --> 29:30.202
I've left 2 messages at his house,

29:30.307 --> 29:32.703
and I don't even know how many
messages on his cell phone.

29:32.805 --> 29:35.302
Are you sure you should tell him
that his wife's...

29:35.405 --> 29:36.700
ghost is here?

29:36.805 --> 29:38.303
How can I not tell him?

29:38.407 --> 29:40.702
Because he can't talk to her, right?

29:40.807 --> 29:44.303
I mean, what's worse?
Thinking someone you love is not there,

29:44.405 --> 29:49.502
or knowing that they are,
and you can't interact with them?

29:49.608 --> 29:51.601
I don't even know
if that's my call to make.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.502
But I can at least tell him that she's
ok and that she's thinking about him.

29:54.608 --> 29:56.303
Ok, I get that.

29:56.407 --> 30:00.001
But what if it makes him...

30:00.706 --> 30:03.003
What?

30:07.705 --> 30:09.401
Are you sure it was him?
It was Gabriel?

30:09.506 --> 30:11.603
Believe me, it was him. What the hell
was he doing with Ethan?

30:11.706 --> 30:14.100
- How do they even know each other?
- You know, I never trusted that Ethan.

30:14.208 --> 30:16.101
- You only met him once.
- I know, but he's got that accent,

30:16.208 --> 30:17.701
- and he's handsome.
- Yeah, and?

30:17.808 --> 30:20.802
Well, that pretty much that covers it.

30:20.908 --> 30:23.000
So, still haven't found your furniture?

30:23.107 --> 30:25.201
That's a sore subject with me.
Let's not bring it up.

30:25.306 --> 30:27.703
I know a place that has
a sale on lawn chairs.

30:27.805 --> 30:30.302
Look, we know that Ethan
is interested in these accidents,

30:30.408 --> 30:31.900
- and what follows, right?
- Right.

30:32.007 --> 30:34.701
Ok, we know that Gabriel wants
to take souls to the dark side

30:34.808 --> 30:36.301
to make the dark side stronger, right?

30:36.407 --> 30:37.102
Yes.

30:37.208 --> 30:41.000
Ok. So how does what Gabriel want
intersect with what Ethan wants?

30:41.105 --> 30:43.001
First, we have to assume that these accidents,

30:43.108 --> 30:46.200
like the plane crash, are being
caused by the dark spirits,

30:46.305 --> 30:48.203
'cause we know that
they're getting stronger and

30:48.307 --> 30:50.503
want to cause pain and grief
whenever they can.

30:50.606 --> 30:52.401
Well, what would the light spirit's
answer to that be?

30:52.505 --> 30:53.903
- Survivors.
- Survivors?

30:54.005 --> 30:55.902
Every accident had one survivor.

30:56.007 --> 30:57.103
Kids.

30:57.208 --> 30:58.800
Purity, innocence.

30:58.906 --> 31:01.903
Yeah. Yeah, these kids had
near-death experiences.

31:02.006 --> 31:04.002
They're special. They're light
spirits in their own right.

31:04.105 --> 31:07.601
And they're powerful ones. And maybe
they're more powerful in groups of four.

31:07.706 --> 31:10.200
My grandmother told me that I have to
protect the balance.

31:10.305 --> 31:12.202
I thought your grandmother died.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.903
Right, sorry, I forget
that doesn't matter in your world.

31:15.005 --> 31:19.201
Look, no one was meant to survive
these accidents, yet these 4 kids did.

31:19.305 --> 31:21.802
And they were touched by the light,
so they're a threat to Gabriel

31:21.906 --> 31:23.400
and whoever controls him.

31:23.507 --> 31:27.100
That's why Gabriel's here.

31:27.305 --> 31:30.401
Where are the kids?

31:50.608 --> 31:54.301
Hello?!

31:54.307 --> 31:55.500
I need to see Ethan.

31:55.605 --> 31:56.702
He's not here.

31:56.808 --> 31:58.103
Where are the kids?

31:58.207 --> 32:02.900
Ethan and his friend left
with them an hour ago.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.602
Where did he take those kids?

32:04.706 --> 32:07.301
Grandview.

32:12.705 --> 32:15.802
Stop! There he is.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.801
No, just wait here.

32:25.606 --> 32:27.701
He promised you that you'd be able
to talk to your wife again, didn't he?

32:27.807 --> 32:29.900
You never told me she was still here.
Gabriel did.

32:30.005 --> 32:32.100
Look, I was trying, ok?
I left you a message.

32:32.205 --> 32:34.703
Did you let him take those kids?

32:34.805 --> 32:36.300
- They're fine.
- Where are the kids?

32:36.407 --> 32:37.700
- I'm not telling you.
- Why not?

32:37.808 --> 32:39.900
Because he told me not to help you.

32:40.008 --> 32:42.901
How the hell did Gabriel find you,
or did you find him?

32:43.007 --> 32:45.903
He came to me. I don't know
how he knew about me or the kids.

32:46.005 --> 32:49.303
He told me he could see the dead,
and that my wife was here.

32:49.406 --> 32:51.702
He told me that she could come here,

32:51.808 --> 32:53.401
but that you'd make her go away.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.702
I can't make her do anything.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.803
He told me she could come back forever,

32:57.905 --> 32:59.802
that I could talk to her,

32:59.905 --> 33:01.702
that she'd come right here,

33:01.805 --> 33:03.902
but if I helped you,

33:04.006 --> 33:05.403
you wouldn't let her come.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.202
Ethan, I've seen Dana.

33:07.307 --> 33:10.401
Ok? I didn't know who she was at first,
but she kept coming to me.

33:10.505 --> 33:13.503
She showed me the accident, she helped
me understand what's going on.

33:13.608 --> 33:15.303
Those kids are in danger.

33:15.407 --> 33:18.303
He told me I shouldn't believe you.

33:18.405 --> 33:20.702
Tell him he has to help you.

33:20.805 --> 33:23.502
She's here.

33:26.708 --> 33:27.703
Dana...

33:27.807 --> 33:31.300
She wants you to help me.

33:32.005 --> 33:34.800
How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

33:34.905 --> 33:39.800
Ask him if he remembers what he said to
me the day he asked me to marry him.

33:39.908 --> 33:43.003
Do you remember what you said to her
the day that you proposed?

33:43.108 --> 33:44.800
Of course I do.

33:44.908 --> 33:47.401
He said if I married him,

33:47.506 --> 33:50.101
I'd never spend another lonely minute.

33:50.208 --> 33:55.402
You told her she'd never
spend another lonely minute.

33:57.805 --> 34:00.903
I miss you so much.

34:01.206 --> 34:04.103
You made me try so hard.

34:04.208 --> 34:08.400
All I wanted was to be the man
you thought I was.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.802
Now it's too late.

34:10.906 --> 34:13.103
Nothing matters anymore.

34:13.205 --> 34:16.302
It's not too late.

34:16.405 --> 34:18.303
Tell him...

34:18.407 --> 34:20.601
this is all meant to happen.

34:20.705 --> 34:22.703
Everything happened for a reason.

34:22.806 --> 34:24.603
She said it's never too late,

34:24.705 --> 34:27.502
and that everything has happened
for a reason.

34:27.608 --> 34:29.400
She wants you to help me, Ethan.

34:29.507 --> 34:31.103
Ok, that's what means
something right now.

34:31.208 --> 34:34.800
Now please tell me where
Gabriel took those kids.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.101
The dedication.

34:36.205 --> 34:38.600
He wanted them to be
part of the lantern walk.

34:38.706 --> 34:42.001
He said it would be good for them
if they were part of something.

34:42.106 --> 34:46.400
I mean, you didn't tell me
she was here!

34:46.507 --> 34:49.100
I'm sorry!

34:51.906 --> 34:54.501
I'm sorry.

35:01.806 --> 35:04.503
I love you.

35:21.408 --> 35:24.802
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can have your attention, please...

35:24.905 --> 35:28.800
you all know me, I'm mayor Milio,
and I'd like to say to you,

35:28.907 --> 35:34.001
today marks the anniversary
of a very tragic event.

35:34.105 --> 35:35.200
Mel, hey.

35:35.307 --> 35:36.601
Jim, it's me.

35:36.708 --> 35:39.202
I need you to find Kristen
and the other kids.

35:39.306 --> 35:42.401
Mel, there's no signal up here.
I can't here you.

35:42.506 --> 35:43.603
No, hello?

35:43.706 --> 35:45.002
Mel?

35:45.106 --> 35:47.602
Oh, Jim?!

35:50.407 --> 35:53.701
Can you go any faster?

35:55.207 --> 35:58.300
We are people from different
parts of the county,

35:58.406 --> 36:00.300
different parts of the state,

36:00.407 --> 36:02.103
and we're all here this evening

36:02.207 --> 36:05.803
in order to honor these poor souls.

36:05.907 --> 36:11.703
The children of Grandview have joined
together for a lantern procession.

36:11.807 --> 36:13.202
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:13.305 --> 36:16.102
our children.

38:10.407 --> 38:12.003
It's ok, sweetie.

38:12.108 --> 38:13.501
You're safe.

38:13.607 --> 38:18.103
I'm sorry.

38:18.108 --> 38:20.000
This is what I saw.

38:20.108 --> 38:21.701
What?

38:21.806 --> 38:24.803
What did you see?

38:36.307 --> 38:38.501
Mel!

38:43.807 --> 38:48.001
Give me a B.V.F.
And an airway! Now!

39:02.405 --> 39:05.302
The fifth sign.

39:06.406 --> 39:09.503
Death of loved one.

39:25.806 --> 39:26.902
No!

39:27.008 --> 39:30.100
No, I'm not ready.

39:30.307 --> 39:32.200
You are ready.

39:32.308 --> 39:34.103
But not for the light.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.101
For what's inside you.

39:36.205 --> 39:41.001
The darkness that's always
been there, waiting.

40:03.605 --> 40:07.901
It's time for you to know who you are.

40:08.607 --> 40:12.501
And to know who your brother is.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.803
No!

40:49.406 --> 40:52.701
Hey, can you hear me?

40:56.408 --> 41:00.501
It wasn't about me protecting them.

41:05.006 --> 41:07.403
It was about them protecting me.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.303
What happened?

41:12.108 --> 41:14.701
I think I have a brother.

41:14.807 --> 41:17.001
What?

41:17.108 --> 41:19.300
I think I have a brother.

41:19.407 --> 41:24.001
All right, Mel,
what are you talking about?

41:27.908 --> 41:29.601
He said I have a brother.

41:29.705 --> 41:34.201
Who said this?
Who told you you have a brother?

41:34.305 --> 41:35.801
My father.
