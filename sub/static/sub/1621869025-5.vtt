that a hundred years ago,

00:03.713 --> 00:06.298
there was a man named

a majestic house in Carp.

But the land he chose
was believed to be cursed.

Graybill didn't believe
in curses

24:55.786 --> 24:57.371
[Dodge] "Clues inside the dead."

24:57.371 --> 24:59.123
Guess we have
to find the bodies?

24:59.123 --> 25:01.209
Maybe it's a-a warning.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.127
Let's see what else we can find.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.213
[Natalie] Why don't we go
that way?

25:05.213 --> 25:07.673
- We should stick together.
- You want to check the kitchen?

25:07.673 --> 25:09.759
[man] Let's go look upstairs.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.137
[indistinct chatter]

25:15.473 --> 25:17.975
[Heather] Let's go
the other way.

25:17.975 --> 25:21.562
- [wooden creaking]
- [electricity hissing]

25:21.562 --> 25:24.690
I'll just, uh... wait here.

25:26.067 --> 25:29.779
By myself... I hope.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.323
[Drew gasps]

25:32.323 --> 25:33.908
[laughs]

25:33.908 --> 25:36.285
I could report you for that.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.205
But consider it...

25:39.205 --> 25:41.123
on the house. Maybe.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.544
[door creaks]

26:00.893 --> 26:02.395
[gasps]

26:02.395 --> 26:04.272
[creaking]

26:04.272 --> 26:05.815
- You all right?
- [Natalie] Yeah.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.400
I'm okay.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.402
Just freaked me out a bit.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.363
[Dodge] Stupid...

26:12.363 --> 26:14.490
What are you doing?

26:21.872 --> 26:23.791
[glass breaking, clanking]

26:23.791 --> 26:25.835
[Heather] Hey, guys,
over here.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.461
- Yeah.
- What is it?

26:27.461 --> 26:29.380
There you are.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.840
Check out the bloody riddle.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.427
"One flew over a rooftop,
one flew into the moon.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.595
Track down the clue
inside the Who

26:36.595 --> 26:38.806
whose end Ed mirrors soon."

26:38.806 --> 26:41.267
That sounds like
a nursery rhyme, doesn't it?

26:41.267 --> 26:44.478
Maybe we should be
looking for books. Yeah?

26:44.478 --> 26:46.856
Good luck, y'all.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.528
The noose.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.156
Mirror. If you look
at the message in a mirror,

26:55.156 --> 26:57.575
"soon" spelled backwards
is "noose."

26:57.575 --> 27:00.286
That's the "who"--
the noosed man.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.126
[clinking]

27:09.128 --> 27:11.797
All right.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.925
"The Cook and five to dinner,
make six to tally late;

27:14.925 --> 27:18.137

behind the hands that wait."

27:18.137 --> 27:19.680
"Cook" is capitalized.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.600
Um, maybe the clue's
in the kitchen?

27:22.600 --> 27:24.060
[Dodge] Let's check it out.

27:24.060 --> 27:26.937
- Your turn.
- Cool.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.529
- [door opens]
- [wooden creaking]

27:44.914 --> 27:46.957

- [woman 2] Yeah.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.584
[indistinct chatter]

27:48.584 --> 27:50.419
[Natalie] You see any clues?

27:50.419 --> 27:52.046
[Dodge] I don't see
anything on the walls.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.346
[distant, indistinct chatter]

28:01.389 --> 28:03.307

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:42.263 --> 28:43.681
That's what I call
"mood lighting."

28:43.681 --> 28:46.183
Aren't you afraid of the curse?

28:46.183 --> 28:49.145
Only if you're afraid
of falling in love with me.

I lost my mind
for a couple of days.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.509

to have a distraction.

was exactly the point.

is this shit?
