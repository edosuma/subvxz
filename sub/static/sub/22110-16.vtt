Hi, I'm Peter Griffin,

00:32.816 --> 00:35.352
and I'm here at
The Museum of Television & Radio

00:35.385 --> 00:37.121
to commemorate Family Guy

00:37.154 --> 00:40.190
becoming the longest-running
show in television history.

00:40.224 --> 00:45.629
For 60 years, Sunday has meant
God, football and Family Guy.

00:45.662 --> 00:48.365
And later, to a lesser degree,
The Simpsons.

00:48.398 --> 00:51.268
Premiering in 1952
as a recurring sketch

00:51.301 --> 00:53.637
in the popular
Dow Chemical Follies,

00:53.670 --> 00:56.306
Family Guy has survived
19 cancellations,

00:56.340 --> 00:58.142
two assassination attempts,

00:58.175 --> 01:00.777
and a pretty good ribbing
by those South Park guys.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.480
Well, tonight we take
a look back at classic episodes

01:03.513 --> 01:05.315
from our first three decades.

01:05.349 --> 01:07.217
Uhp, here come some tourists.

01:07.251 --> 01:10.987
I know, I'll sit here
and pretend I'm a wax figure.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.656
Who is that?

01:12.689 --> 01:15.091
That's the fat idiot from
The Family Guy.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.861
-Ugh. I hate that show.
-Me, too.

01:24.468 --> 01:26.336
-(bell rings) -ANNOUNCER:
Raleigh Kids Cigarettes

01:26.370 --> 01:28.805
is happy to bring you
Family Guy,

01:28.838 --> 01:32.276
the story of an American family
named the Griffins.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.144
-This is Peter,
-(light orchestra music playing)

01:34.178 --> 01:36.079
breadwinner
and head of household.

01:36.112 --> 01:38.615
Lois is the name of his wife.

01:38.648 --> 01:40.350
These are their children.

01:40.384 --> 01:43.019
This is Chris,
the firstborn son.

01:43.052 --> 01:46.456
This is little Stewie.
Oh, boy, he's a handful.

01:46.490 --> 01:48.124
Meg.

01:48.158 --> 01:51.361
And introducing Doodles Weaver
as Brian the Dog.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.999
We don't trust just any
cigarette for our children.

01:56.032 --> 01:59.269
Raleigh Kids is the only
cigarette made for tiny hands.

01:59.303 --> 02:02.272
It's why it's the playground
favorite. Right, kids?

02:02.306 --> 02:04.941
(laughing)

02:04.974 --> 02:06.376
ANNOUNCER:
And now, Raleigh Kids,

02:06.410 --> 02:08.545
also the makers
of Kinder Coffee,

02:08.578 --> 02:11.248
invites you to watch
Family Guy.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.852
Dad, I overheard
the fellas talking.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.887
Can I ask you a question
about girls?

02:17.921 --> 02:19.856
Of course, son.
You're a young man now.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.325
It's natural to be curious.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.692
Thanks, Pop.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.661
What's "knuckle-dunk"?

02:24.694 --> 02:26.230
-(siren blares)
-Uhp, atomic test.

02:26.263 --> 02:27.797
Put on your glasses.

02:27.831 --> 02:29.566
Never mind
what your friends said.

02:29.599 --> 02:32.336
If you want to have fun
with your girl, try dancing.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.238
It's fun and good
for your health.

02:34.271 --> 02:36.240
(explosion)

02:36.273 --> 02:37.974
(chuckles)
Swell, that's helpful.

02:38.007 --> 02:39.876
So, what's going on
if a guy says

02:39.909 --> 02:42.879
a girl "has a red scare
in her Harry Truman"?

02:42.912 --> 02:44.914
-Fence.
-(wind gusting)

02:47.083 --> 02:49.085
(both grunting)

02:50.454 --> 02:52.456
Oh, look,
here comes the milkman.

02:55.892 --> 02:57.927
So convenient.

02:57.961 --> 02:59.829
TOM TUCKER: Good evening,
everyone. I'm Tom Tucker,

02:59.863 --> 03:02.098
and this is the Radio 5 news.

03:02.131 --> 03:05.001
Our top story this evening,
songsmith Elvis Presley

03:05.034 --> 03:07.671
will be appearing on The Ed
Sullivan Show this Sunday night

03:07.704 --> 03:10.540
on that never-gonna-last fad
called television.

03:10.574 --> 03:14.110
And now a word from our
sponsor: Fred Trump Apartments.

03:14.143 --> 03:17.281
If you don't want to live
with blacks, Fred Trump.

03:17.314 --> 03:20.784
Wow, Elvis Presley!
Can we get a television set?

03:20.817 --> 03:22.719
Sorry, Chris,
we don't got the money.

03:22.752 --> 03:24.454
I spent our entire savings

03:24.488 --> 03:26.923
building that stupid fallout
shelter we never get to use.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.425
(explosion)

03:28.458 --> 03:29.959
Why don't you just buy a TV
for the weekend,

03:29.993 --> 03:31.695
-watch Elvis,
-(man screaming outside)

03:31.728 --> 03:33.630
and then return it on Monday
and say it doesn't work?

03:33.663 --> 03:35.632
Boy, even in the '50s,
you're a scumbag.

03:35.665 --> 03:38.302
-That's a great idea, boy!
-Hang on.

03:38.335 --> 03:41.137
Why don't I just get a job
to help pay for it?

03:41.170 --> 03:43.473
What? No wife of mine
is working.

03:43.507 --> 03:45.575
There's underpants in this house
that need starching.

03:45.609 --> 03:47.811
I don't want to go to work
in soft underpants

03:47.844 --> 03:50.847
like some Nancy boy;
I want to go to work like this.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.320
Stiff as a plate.
That's underpants.

04:01.358 --> 04:04.461
We got some time before Elvis.
Can we see what else is on?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.995
-Sure thing.
-(TV static hisses)

04:06.029 --> 04:09.499
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to 1950s sci-fi,

04:09.533 --> 04:12.836
which is always a man in a
silver suit battling a monster.

04:12.869 --> 04:14.571
Leave us humans alone.

04:14.604 --> 04:18.308
It's 1994,
and the moon belongs to Earth.

04:18.342 --> 04:21.511
(dramatic orchestra music
playing)

04:21.545 --> 04:23.046
Rawr.

04:27.283 --> 04:29.986
(growling)

04:30.019 --> 04:31.921
It's safe now.

04:31.955 --> 04:34.624
How's the soil,
Professor Knockers?

04:34.658 --> 04:35.825
It's good.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.627
Good. Good.

04:39.062 --> 04:40.630
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker,

04:40.664 --> 04:42.832
previously of Radio 5 news.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.934
Tonight, I bring you
a special report.

04:44.968 --> 04:47.804
Women in the workplace:
hilarious or disturbing?

04:47.837 --> 04:50.006
♪

04:52.041 --> 04:55.379
(stilted):
I am a 1950s man

04:55.412 --> 04:57.547
speaking in a stilted manner,

04:57.581 --> 05:01.317
seemingly with
no self-awareness whatsoever.

05:01.351 --> 05:05.221
(loudly):
I am shouting for some reason

05:05.254 --> 05:10.226
and will now suddenly be
replaced by crude graphics.

05:10.259 --> 05:12.996
-(film projector rattling)
-(descending whistle)

05:13.029 --> 05:14.898
(explosion)

05:14.931 --> 05:18.902
(stilted): This factory
has been beset by women.

05:18.935 --> 05:21.237
Is your factory next?

05:21.270 --> 05:23.272
(dramatic orchestra music
playing)

05:25.609 --> 05:28.244
Lois, that's you!
You took a job?

05:28.277 --> 05:30.213
Sorry, Peter.
I wanted to tell you,

05:30.246 --> 05:32.148
but you were
so dead set against it.

05:32.181 --> 05:33.550
Damn right I'm against it!

05:33.583 --> 05:35.585
If God wanted
women in the workplace,

05:35.619 --> 05:37.153
he'd have made them alcoholics.

05:37.186 --> 05:38.888
Now, you're quitting
that job tomorrow.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.658
-No, I'm not.
-Quiet. Elvis is on.

05:41.691 --> 05:44.594
ED SULLIVAN: Ladies and
gentlemen, Elvis Presley.

05:44.628 --> 05:46.930
(audience cheering)

05:46.963 --> 05:49.699
-Huh?
-What?! Elvis Presley is white?

05:49.733 --> 05:51.601
Cleveland, did you know
about this?

05:51.635 --> 05:54.604
Come on, Donna, let's pick up
some gizzards and fried skins

05:54.638 --> 05:56.540
and head on down
to the juke joint.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.842
Tonight it's gonna be jumpin'!

05:58.875 --> 06:00.610
(lively jazz music playing)

06:00.644 --> 06:03.780
PETER: And it was jumpin'.
It really was.

06:03.813 --> 06:05.615
But I was banished
to the sidewalk

06:05.649 --> 06:09.453
because I called one of
the band guys a bad name.

06:09.486 --> 06:11.955
(crickets chirping)

06:11.988 --> 06:15.358
I thought you were
bringing the TV back.

06:15.391 --> 06:17.627
I changed my mind.
This TV is awesome!

06:17.661 --> 06:19.295
I've been watching it all day.

06:19.328 --> 06:21.765
You can keep your job
so we can afford this thing.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.068
-Oh, that's great news, Peter.
-You know, Lois, I had an idea.

06:25.101 --> 06:27.904
Instead of eating
in another room and talking,

06:27.937 --> 06:31.240
what if we bring the food
out here and never talk again?

06:31.274 --> 06:34.343
-That's a great idea.
-Shh.

06:38.682 --> 06:41.317
ANNOUNCER: Are you looking for
the perfect breakfast meal?

06:41.350 --> 06:44.320
Try Post Raisin Bran,
made with raisins,

06:44.353 --> 06:46.656
which are grapes
that have been dried in the sun

06:46.690 --> 06:48.658
for a long period of time;

06:48.692 --> 06:52.562
and bran, the hard outer layers
of cereal grain.

06:52.596 --> 06:56.833
Along with germ, it is an
integral part of whole grains.

06:56.866 --> 06:59.469
When you eat Raisin Bran,
it fills your stomach

06:59.503 --> 07:02.171
and keeps you from feeling
the sensation of hunger.

07:02.205 --> 07:04.340
"Hunger" being pangs
in the belly

07:04.373 --> 07:06.610
as a result of
lack of nourishment,

07:06.643 --> 07:09.278
thereby sending signals
to your brain telling you,

07:09.312 --> 07:11.180
"Hey, I'm hungry."

07:11.214 --> 07:14.017
And when you hear
Mr. "Hey, I'm Hungry,"

07:14.050 --> 07:17.453
be sure to have a hearty bowl
of Post Raisin Bran.

07:17.487 --> 07:20.456
Again, made with raisins,
which are grapes

07:20.490 --> 07:23.459
that have been dried in the sun
for a long period of time;

07:23.493 --> 07:27.030
and bran, the hard outer layers
of cereal grain.

07:27.063 --> 07:31.034
Along with germ, it is an
integral part of whole grains.

You can barely absorb any of it.

08:05.268 --> 08:07.036
(sighs) I don't know
how you do it, Peter.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.371
Can we get some Raisin Bran?

08:08.404 --> 08:10.006
Do we have any Raisin Bran
in the house?

08:10.039 --> 08:11.675
Just working day after day,

08:11.708 --> 08:13.643
I'm exhausted,
and I miss my family.

08:13.677 --> 08:15.511
It's made with raisins,
which are grapes

08:15.545 --> 08:18.181
that have been dried in the sun
for a long period of time.

08:18.214 --> 08:20.383
I gave my notice,
and tomorrow's my last day.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.518
So I guess we have to
get rid of the TV.

08:22.552 --> 08:24.220
By the way,
Chris and Raisin Bran

08:24.253 --> 08:26.289
are at Raisin Bran practice.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.160
Peter, I got a surprise for you

08:31.194 --> 08:32.495
Raisin Bran?

08:32.528 --> 08:33.997
A television?

08:34.030 --> 08:35.932
We can't afford this;
you quit your job.

08:35.965 --> 08:38.101
This is what we were making
on the line.

08:38.134 --> 08:41.404
The only reason I wanted to work
was to make this for you.

Oh, Lois, you're the greatest.

08:50.279 --> 08:54.250
I guess this is why
women shouldn't work. (laughs)

08:54.283 --> 08:56.419
To the moon, Lois!

08:56.452 --> 08:58.688
"To the moon"?
Wh-What does that mean?

08:58.722 --> 09:00.456
You know, "to-to the moon."

09:00.489 --> 09:02.592
Okay, you're threatening
to punch me so hard

09:02.626 --> 09:04.227
I'm gonna fly to the moon?

09:04.260 --> 09:07.263
Like-like it's funny
to hit me so violently

09:07.296 --> 09:10.166
my body will fly
out of the atmosphere?

09:12.168 --> 09:15.071

Hello. I just moved in

10:38.254 --> 10:41.324
My name's Herbert,
not Roy Mitchell.

10:41.357 --> 10:45.028
So, if you see news reports
about a Roy Mitchell

10:45.061 --> 10:49.332
from three towns over who was
accused of all sorts of nonsense

10:49.365 --> 10:52.902
and left in a hurry,
it's got nothing to do with me,

10:52.936 --> 10:55.872
because, again, I'm...

10:55.905 --> 10:57.673
Herbert.

11:01.277 --> 11:04.413
Mom, Dad, Chris is gone!
He went to Woodstock.

11:04.447 --> 11:06.415
Now, Meg, nobody likes a snitch.

11:06.449 --> 11:08.551
I'm not a snitch,
I just tell it like it is.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.086
Damn it, Meg!

11:10.119 --> 11:12.421
Excuse me, Peter,
maybe I should handle this.

11:12.455 --> 11:14.423
-Mr. Brady?
-You know, Meg,

11:14.457 --> 11:16.860
when you tattle on someone,
you're not just telling on them,

11:16.893 --> 11:18.694
you're telling on yourself.

11:18.728 --> 11:21.430
And by tattling on someone,
you're really just telling them,

11:21.464 --> 11:23.099
"I'm a tattletale."

11:23.132 --> 11:25.601
Now, is that the tale
you want to tell?

11:25.634 --> 11:28.671
-I never thought of it that way.
-Thanks, Mr. Brady.

11:28.704 --> 11:30.539
That's right. Mike Brady.

11:30.573 --> 11:34.110
So, if you see any news reports
about an actor named Robert Reed

11:34.143 --> 11:37.680
from three towns over who was
accused of all sorts of nonsense

11:37.713 --> 11:40.583
and left in a hurry,
it's got nothing to do with me,

11:40.616 --> 11:43.386
because, again, I'm...

11:43.419 --> 11:45.021
Mike Brady.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.555
Chris went to Woodstock?

11:46.589 --> 11:48.424
I got to get there
and bring him back

11:48.457 --> 11:49.993
before something bad happens.

12:10.513 --> 12:14.050
Honey, I'm taking the compact;
save a little on gas.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.584
(engine starts)

12:28.197 --> 12:30.533
Cars are bigger back now.

12:32.701 --> 12:34.703
♪

12:38.875 --> 12:40.844
Oh, no, my dad!

12:40.877 --> 12:42.478
PETER (in distance):
Chris!

12:42.511 --> 12:45.714
He'll be here in ten minutes.
I got to hide!

12:47.884 --> 12:51.020
-Chris!
-Dad, what are you doing here?

12:51.054 --> 12:54.190
-I'm here to bring you home.
-Well, I'm not going.

12:54.223 --> 12:56.592
I'm staying here
and smoking dope.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.595
What? No son of mine
is gonna be smoking dope.

12:59.628 --> 13:03.666
Why not, Dad? Is it any worse
than your three martini lunch?

13:03.699 --> 13:05.334
What?! No son of mine

13:05.368 --> 13:07.303
is gonna be drinking
a three martini lunch.

13:07.336 --> 13:10.940
Why not, Dad? Is it any worse
than your five Scotch breakfast?

13:10.974 --> 13:12.641
What?! No son of mine

13:12.675 --> 13:14.777
is gonna be drinking
a five Scotch breakfast.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.712
Why not, Dad?
Is it any worse than

13:16.745 --> 13:20.149
your "three X's drawn on
the jug" corn whiskey moonshine?

13:20.183 --> 13:23.719
What?! No son of mine
drink anything but rice wine.

13:23.752 --> 13:27.623
That's right, we trace
our early family roots to Asia.

13:27.656 --> 13:30.293
Listen, Chris,
your mother and I love you.

13:30.326 --> 13:32.962
We just want you to stay a kid
a little bit longer.

13:32.996 --> 13:36.565
-You understand?
-Um, y-yeah.

13:36.599 --> 13:39.068
I'm glad.
'Cause the thing is, Chris,

13:39.102 --> 13:41.837
drugs turn you into
someone you're not.

13:41.871 --> 13:45.008
But you know what?
We love you just how you are.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.911
That's why I'm so grateful I got
here before you dropped acid

13:47.944 --> 13:49.745
or took any kind of drugs that--

13:49.778 --> 13:52.015
Y-You're trippin' right now,
aren't you?

13:52.048 --> 13:54.583
-A little.
-All right.

13:54.617 --> 13:57.086
Hey, why is Pete Townshend
taking pictures of you?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.255
He's been doing that
all day long.

13:59.288 --> 14:00.990
PETE TOWNSHEND:
It's for a book.

14:01.024 --> 14:02.926
I don't think it's for a book.

14:06.963 --> 14:10.333
Okay, I'm off to do
my paper route.

14:10.366 --> 14:12.101
Wow, Peter, your plan worked

14:12.135 --> 14:14.103
to show Chris
how horrible drugs are.

14:14.137 --> 14:16.105
Quiet, Lois,
I'm trying to watch TV.

14:16.139 --> 14:18.274
NEIL ARMSTRONG:
That's one small step...

14:18.307 --> 14:20.676
ED SULLIVAN: Ladies and
gentlemen, the Beatles.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.578
WALTER CRONKITE:
The flash now official,

14:22.611 --> 14:24.380
President Kennedy
has been killed.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.549
God, there's nothing on.

14:26.582 --> 14:29.018
SINGERS: ♪ Just sit right back
and you'll hear a tale ♪

14:29.052 --> 14:31.654
-There we go.
-♪ A tale of a fateful trip... ♪

14:33.990 --> 14:35.992
(harp music playing)

14:37.326 --> 14:39.328
(somber clarinet music playing)

14:59.648 --> 15:01.650
(birds chirping)

15:02.651 --> 15:05.955
(toy vacuum rattling)

15:05.989 --> 15:09.258
Lois, why is my son playing
with a vacuum like a girl?

15:09.292 --> 15:11.227
Here, play with
this discus and javelin.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.162
Then you can grow up like a man,

15:13.196 --> 15:15.464
like track and field star
Bruce Jenner,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.466
the greatest man in the world.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.668
Maybe you'll even end up
on a box of Wheaties.

15:19.702 --> 15:22.005
Didn't these used to
have nuts in 'em?

15:23.772 --> 15:26.742
Chris, I see in the paper
that Vietnam is still going on,

15:26.775 --> 15:29.912
and as a blue collar TV dad,
I demand you enlist.

15:29.945 --> 15:31.847
Peter, you can't
send Chris to Vietnam.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.316
They're bombing
women and children.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.418
You have no idea
how bad it is over there.

15:35.451 --> 15:37.853
I don't?
Oh, I know war, my friend.

15:37.886 --> 15:40.189
I stormed the beaches
at Normandy.

15:40.223 --> 15:41.991
(yelling)

15:42.025 --> 15:43.792
Of course, it was 1958,

15:43.826 --> 15:45.961
so the resistance
wasn't quite as stiff.

15:45.995 --> 15:48.364
-(whistle blows)
-No running.

15:48.397 --> 15:49.698
I said no running!

15:49.732 --> 15:52.201
I'm not running!

15:52.235 --> 15:54.337
Chris, you are going to Vietnam
and doing your duty,

15:54.370 --> 15:55.804
like Quagmire did.

15:55.838 --> 15:57.773
As a matter of fact,
his tour just ended

15:57.806 --> 15:59.442
and his transport
should be getting in soon.

15:59.475 --> 16:01.044
So let's head down
to the airfield

16:01.077 --> 16:03.846
and give our soldiers
the respect they deserve.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.881
(military music playing)

16:08.051 --> 16:10.386
Welcome home, Quagmire.
(spits)

16:10.419 --> 16:13.322
Oh, good to see you
back safely, Glenn. (spits)

16:13.356 --> 16:15.658
-Murderer!
-Hey, show some respect.

16:15.691 --> 16:17.060
Sorry. (spits)

16:17.093 --> 16:18.994
Oh, I left my carry-on
back on the plane.

16:19.028 --> 16:20.396
All right, when he comes back,

16:20.429 --> 16:22.131
we got to make him
feel welcome again.

16:22.165 --> 16:25.134
(snorting, hawking)

16:25.168 --> 16:27.636
(disco music playing)

16:27.670 --> 16:29.138
Boy, the Clam
sure looks different.

16:29.172 --> 16:31.074
Yeah, just be careful with
your collars on the way in.

16:31.107 --> 16:32.641
They're kind of sharp.

16:32.675 --> 16:35.978
("A Fifth of Beethoven"
by Walter Murphy playing)

16:36.011 --> 16:38.013
(indistinct chatter)

16:38.047 --> 16:40.516
-Hey. (grunts)
-(grunts)

16:40.549 --> 16:42.718
(laughs, grunts)

16:42.751 --> 16:44.887
(groans)

16:44.920 --> 16:46.489
Oh. (grunts)

16:46.522 --> 16:48.157
(grunting)

16:48.191 --> 16:50.193
Hey, hey. (grunts)

16:51.894 --> 16:54.497
(grunting)

16:54.530 --> 16:56.532
(people grunting)

17:04.807 --> 17:08.177
Yeah, we'll have a round
of beers for the table.

17:08.211 --> 17:10.012
Uhp, we got her, too.

17:10.045 --> 17:13.282
It's good to have you back from
the war in one piece, Quagmire.

17:13.316 --> 17:15.584
Yeah, some of us
weren't so lucky.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.420
What are you talking about?
You never went to Vietnam.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.687
Hell I didn't!

17:18.721 --> 17:21.390
I went to the draft board
and told them I was gay,

17:21.424 --> 17:24.260
and then got hit by a bus
on the walk home.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.295
(sobbing)

17:27.963 --> 17:30.266
So, Quagmire, Chris is
shipping out tomorrow morning,

17:30.299 --> 17:32.067
and he's pretty nervous.

17:32.101 --> 17:35.404
I know you enjoy staring, like,
3,000 feet out into dead space,

17:35.438 --> 17:37.473
but you got any good stories
I could tell him

17:37.506 --> 17:39.142
about how cool 'Nam is?

17:39.175 --> 17:41.810
You know, there's lots of things
you expect in war--

17:41.844 --> 17:44.413
carnage, the sleepless nights--

17:44.447 --> 17:46.549
but what they don't
prepare you for

17:46.582 --> 17:48.984
is the incessant use of
"Fortunate Son."

17:49.017 --> 17:50.786
("Fortunate Son" by Creedence
Clearwater Revival playing)

17:50.819 --> 17:53.122
I'd hear that song
any time I was in a helicopter.

17:55.090 --> 17:57.626
Or taking a swift boat
deep into the jungle,

17:57.660 --> 17:59.962
that song again.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.730
My penis would even play
"Fortunate Son"

18:01.764 --> 18:04.066
while I was visiting
a whorehouse.

18:04.099 --> 18:07.136
(volume fluctuating):
♪ It ain't me, it ain't me ♪

18:07.170 --> 18:10.339
♪ I ain't
no millionaire's son, no... ♪

18:10.373 --> 18:12.575
Oh, Lord, that's horrible!

18:12.608 --> 18:14.777
There must have been
some other song you heard.

18:14.810 --> 18:16.445
Yeah, there was.

18:16.479 --> 18:19.081
That "There's something
happening here" song.

18:19.114 --> 18:20.516
Hey, I just realized,

18:20.549 --> 18:22.785
your clothes kind of
look like the jungle.

18:22.818 --> 18:24.687
Shut up, Joe!
You weren't there!

18:24.720 --> 18:27.089
You don't know!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

18:27.122 --> 18:28.857
You didn't hear
the songs I heard!

18:28.891 --> 18:30.959
Oh, my God,
Chris ships out in the morning!

18:30.993 --> 18:33.796
I got to get him out to there.
I thought this war would be fun,

18:33.829 --> 18:36.532
you know, just go over there
and fight the Donkey Kong.

18:36.565 --> 18:39.001
We were trying
to fight the war our way,

18:39.034 --> 18:41.036
the way we'd always fought wars,

18:41.069 --> 18:44.607
but we were gradually climbing
steel beams and ladders,

18:44.640 --> 18:46.442
and the Donkey Kong knew that.

18:46.475 --> 18:48.344
It was barrel after barrel.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.546
We lost a lot of good men.

18:50.579 --> 18:52.615
And so many quarters.

18:52.648 --> 18:54.483
(drums playing march)

18:58.421 --> 19:00.956
Now, listen up!
When you hear your name,

19:00.989 --> 19:03.192
I want you to sound off smartly
and move out.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.194
-Capo.
-Yes, sir.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.129
-Sumner.
-Yes, sir.

I said put your duffel bag

Well, that's all we got tonight.
Hope you enjoyed it.

20:38.454 --> 20:41.156
And I hope the exhibits here at
The Museum of Television & Radio

20:41.189 --> 20:43.892
don't come to life like
Night at the Museum.

20:43.926 --> 20:46.295
-Hey, Peter!
-(screams) Don Knotts!

20:46.329 --> 20:48.497
-I just want to talk.
-Stay away from me!

20:48.531 --> 20:50.333
Andy Griffith
used to beat me up.

20:50.366 --> 20:51.834
He was a big drinker.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.302
Ask Ron Howard, he'll tell you.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.103
Help! Someone!

20:55.137 --> 20:58.173
Tim Conway was sleeping with
half the Apple Dumpling Gang.

20:58.206 --> 21:00.943
You two were the only ones
in the Apple Dumpling Gang!

21:00.976 --> 21:03.546
You're doing the math now,
aren't you?
