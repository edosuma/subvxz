roll solo.

I roll solo for breakfast.

-Coming up...
-Not again, Fred.

02:26.790 --> 02:29.250
Maybe he shouldn't
roll solo for breakfast again.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.290
Or brunch.
Fred loves to brunch.

It's just when
he puts on the suit,

02:34.210 --> 02:35.580
he gets carried away.

has to watch the city

02:45.380 --> 02:47.880
Yeah, but who's gonna
watch Fred watching the city?

-Mini-Max.
-Mini-Max?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.580
(mechanical whirring)

02:51.580 --> 02:54.750
I'm designing Mini-Max
to keep an eye on Fred

Cool! Like a nanny.

03:07.670 --> 03:08.960
How long have you
been standing there?

03:08.960 --> 03:10.540
Long enough.

03:10.540 --> 03:13.330
Long enough to hear
you're building me a sidekick!

03:13.330 --> 03:14.620
Uh, yeah.

my new sidekick

03:19.170 --> 03:21.620
going to be ready
to side kick some butt?

03:21.620 --> 03:23.170
Pun intended.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.250
Intended to what?

03:25.250 --> 03:27.830
Amuse those who go in
for that sort of thing.

03:27.830 --> 03:28.830
So no one.

03:30.330 --> 03:31.500
He'll be ready soon.

04:08.620 --> 04:10.790

04:10.790 --> 04:13.040
Well, I'm going home.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.210

do the same!

We are gonna be
such a classic duo.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.790
I'm obviously gonna be
the more serious logical one,

05:38.790 --> 05:41.250
and Mini-Max is gonna be
the plucky comic relief.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.710
Right, Mini-Max?

05:42.710 --> 05:43.920
(Fred groans)

05:43.920 --> 05:45.290
Mini-Max:
Do you yield?

05:45.290 --> 05:48.790
(strained)
I was just trying
to pat your head.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.210
My apologies!

05:50.210 --> 05:52.500
Carry on with your
affectionate gesture.

05:54.670 --> 05:56.670
(whirring)

05:56.670 --> 05:59.040
You have a minor abrasion

05:59.040 --> 06:02.000
Icing the area
for ten minutes
twice a day

06:02.000 --> 06:04.290
-is recommended.
-Fred: Mmm.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.670
Hello. I am Baymax.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.080
Greetings! I am Mini-Max!

06:15.080 --> 06:18.500

06:18.500 --> 06:19.710

06:19.710 --> 06:22.830

a champion for justice!

06:22.830 --> 06:23.790

06:23.790 --> 06:25.750
I am a personal
healthcare companion.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.880
Okay, this is Captain Fancy--

06:32.880 --> 06:34.380
A fictional
comic book character.

06:34.380 --> 06:35.790
By day, Lash Looper,

06:35.790 --> 06:37.710
wise-cracking cab driver.

06:37.710 --> 06:40.460
By night, Crash City's
dapper defender!

06:40.460 --> 06:43.040
Yes! And see, Captain Fancy's
got a sidekick like you.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.880
Dandy Boy.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.620
I do not have
internal organs!

06:47.620 --> 06:49.920
So glad
Professor Granville gave us

06:49.920 --> 06:51.920
an extension
on our midterms.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.790
Definitely needed more time.

06:53.790 --> 06:56.290
Which is why
we're watching a movie
instead of working.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.830
(scoffs)
The Mermaiden's Tale is so much
more than a movie, Go Go!

06:59.830 --> 07:02.710
If you don't cry
when she throws herself
in front of that harpoon,

07:02.710 --> 07:05.040
oh, then you're
just dead inside.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.830
Yep. Guilty.

07:06.830 --> 07:08.880
You guys ever wonder
about Professor Granville?

07:08.880 --> 07:11.000
(crying)
No. Why?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.380
There, there.

07:12.380 --> 07:14.380
She, uh, kinda lied to me.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.500
Last night she said
she was going home,

07:16.500 --> 07:19.000
but then she snuck back in to--
to work on something.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.290
Yeah, but isn't that exactly
what you were doing?

07:21.290 --> 07:22.920
Technically, sure.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.620
But I had a good reason.

07:24.620 --> 07:27.880
What if Professor Granville's
up to something, you know, bad?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.880
(laughing)

07:30.880 --> 07:33.500
-Fred: Oh, please!
-Honey Lemon: That's funny!

07:33.500 --> 07:36.670
(mechanical laughter)

07:36.670 --> 07:38.380
I'm serious. Think about it.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.250
She mysteriously stopped
teaching 20 years ago,

07:41.250 --> 07:42.750
and has suddenly returned.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.960
Plus, she used
to keep the, you know,

07:44.960 --> 07:48.580
just the rarest superconductor
in the universe on her desk
as a paperweight.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.500
And now she's working
on some secret project!

07:50.500 --> 07:54.210
Ever think you might be
letting your personal feelings
get in the way here?

07:54.210 --> 07:57.880
-Just a tad-ski?
-Yeah, everyone knows
Granville's really hard on you.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.540
Try to focus
on the positive.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.210
She gives you
a lot of attention!

08:01.210 --> 08:03.290
Guys, I'm telling you.
Something's not right.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.170
-Come on, Baymax.
-Where are you going?

08:05.170 --> 08:07.210
To find out the truth
about Professor Granville.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.710
(distant siren wailing)

08:16.710 --> 08:17.880
Good Luck Alley?

08:17.880 --> 08:19.330
We're gonna have
to go undercover.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.750
You know the guy.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.120
Felony something.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.670
Wait, you mean Carl?

08:24.670 --> 08:25.880
(grunts)

08:25.880 --> 08:27.750
Hey! Watch where you're going!

08:27.750 --> 08:29.380
Are you injured?

08:29.380 --> 08:32.040
-Scanning.
-(beeping, whirring)

08:32.040 --> 08:34.790
-You are not injured.
-(Hiro laughs nervously)

08:34.790 --> 08:35.960
Weirdo.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.830
Come on, Baymax.
We're losing her.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.670
(growls)

08:43.670 --> 08:46.500
-(nervously) Hi.
-I just had this
tracksuit dry-cleaned!

08:46.500 --> 08:48.500
-Get them!
-Baymax: Oh, no.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.920
(horn beeps)

08:55.920 --> 08:58.210
(engine revving)

08:58.210 --> 09:00.500
Ha! Coming through! Sorry!

09:00.500 --> 09:01.790
Pardon me!

09:03.750 --> 09:05.460
(motorcycle engines revving)

09:08.960 --> 09:10.880
Baymax:
It appears
there is no exit.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.420
Then, we'll have to make one.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.080
(beeps)

09:18.080 --> 09:19.960
-Whoa!
-(rockets roaring)

09:21.290 --> 09:24.080
Baymax (in slow-motion):
Oh... no.

09:25.670 --> 09:26.880
(clattering)

09:30.460 --> 09:32.540
The hero looks,

09:32.540 --> 09:34.170
scans, searches.

09:34.170 --> 09:37.080
Not a sign of illegal activity.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.960
Not a sign.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.000
I have detected a sign
of illegal activity.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.080
Yeah! Just saw that!

09:43.080 --> 09:44.330
We're so in sync!

09:44.330 --> 09:46.080
(chuckling)
We should probably
get on that.

09:47.380 --> 09:50.620
Mini-Maximum
damage control!

09:52.710 --> 09:55.000
(coins clinking)

09:55.000 --> 09:57.210
I will cross-check
physical characteristics

09:57.210 --> 09:59.040
against my criminal database!

09:59.040 --> 10:01.250
No need, Mini-Max!
Right, Globby?

10:01.250 --> 10:04.710
(in bad Cockney accent)
Globby? I don't know
who you're talking about.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.960
That ski mask isn't
fooling anyone, Globby.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.330
We can see
your entire body.

10:08.330 --> 10:11.290
Oh, and you call that
a Cockney accent?

10:11.290 --> 10:13.120
(in bad Cockney accent):
I can do better, guv'nor!

10:13.120 --> 10:15.040
Both your accents
were highly inaccurate!

10:15.040 --> 10:16.580
Well, sorry!

10:16.580 --> 10:18.120
I've never been to Cockney.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.040
And this ski mask is because
I heard it might snow.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.960
You cannot roll away
from justice!

10:24.960 --> 10:27.460
Don't worry, Mini-Max.
Fredzilla's all over this!

10:27.460 --> 10:30.330
And I am all over Fredzilla!

10:33.620 --> 10:34.880
Shield!

10:37.620 --> 10:39.500
(humming)

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Intercept!

10:44.830 --> 10:46.290
Nowhere to go, snowball!

10:46.290 --> 10:48.120
-Give up!
-Never!

10:48.120 --> 10:49.620
Have it your way.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.830
(gulps)

10:52.830 --> 10:54.120
(belches)

10:54.120 --> 10:55.620
Ah, spicy.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.080
Turns out, you can
fight fire with fire.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.250
Mini-Maximum extinguisher!

11:05.920 --> 11:07.920
You haven't seen
the last of me.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.330
(Globby cackling)

11:11.330 --> 11:14.960
I successfully averted
all Fred-related disasters.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.710
Yeah, that's not really
a sidekick sorta line,
but nice hustle out there!

11:18.710 --> 11:20.420
We make a great team,
Mini-Max!

11:20.420 --> 11:21.500
Are you feeling it?!

11:21.500 --> 11:22.880
I feel nothing.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.250
-I am a robot.
-You will.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.960
Before we know it,
we're going to be...

11:28.380 --> 11:31.120
...finishing
each other's sentences.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.670
Don't worry.
We'll get there.

11:32.670 --> 11:34.460
Come on,
Mini-Maximum fist bump?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.880
Mini-Maximum fist bump!

11:36.880 --> 11:38.920
-(clattering)
-(cat yowls)

11:38.920 --> 11:41.540
Fred:
Maybe we do a Mini-Medium
fist bump next time?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.040
-(tools clatter)
-(gum pops)

11:46.040 --> 11:48.120
Uh, Granville update, everybody.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.250
Totally up to something.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.080
Mysterious past,
mysterious work in the lab,

11:52.080 --> 11:53.960
and a mysterious visit
to Good Luck Alley.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.000
That is a lot of mystery.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.040
What was she doing
in Good Luck Alley?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.210
Hiro:
I don't know.

11:59.210 --> 12:01.080
We got chased away
by Yama and this thugs

12:01.080 --> 12:02.500
before we could
find out-- whoa!

12:02.500 --> 12:04.040
Hiro, what is it?

12:04.040 --> 12:07.420
I think I found someone
who might have some answers.

12:13.420 --> 12:16.040
Professor Granville.
You worked with her
20 years ago?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.250
She was an
excellent teacher.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.790
It was a shame
the way she left.

12:19.790 --> 12:20.920
What happened?

12:20.920 --> 12:23.080
She was in the lab
after-hours.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.580
Something went wrong.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.750
There was... an incident.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.420
What kind of incident?

12:28.420 --> 12:30.670
Officially, a pipe burst,

12:30.670 --> 12:32.000
but there were rumors.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.080
An unsanctioned project
gone wrong.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.120
-So she was fired?
-She resigned.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.790
The matter was not
pursued further.
That's all I know.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.000
This is helpful.
Thank you, Professor Callaghan.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Hiro!

12:44.210 --> 12:47.460
I never thanked you
for saving my Abigail.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.830
I'm-- I'm glad she's okay.

12:49.830 --> 12:52.120
I never set out
to hurt anyone.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.380
What happened to Tadashi
because of me...

12:55.380 --> 12:57.420
I know it's not enough,

12:57.420 --> 12:59.290
but I'm sorry.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.580
Tadashi would've, um,
wanted me to forgive you.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.250
(exhales sharply)
Someday I hope I can.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.960
(heavy doors creak, slam)

13:10.960 --> 13:12.580
(scooter buzzing)

13:14.250 --> 13:16.080
(mechanical whirring)

13:25.830 --> 13:27.250
(clatters)

13:30.880 --> 13:33.170
(beeping, buzzes)

13:35.380 --> 13:36.670
(trills)

13:36.670 --> 13:38.330
-(beeping)
-(gasps)

13:38.330 --> 13:39.830
Security System:
Threat detected.

13:39.830 --> 13:41.750
Threat detected.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.250
(gasps)

13:48.290 --> 13:49.960
(shudders)

13:50.960 --> 13:53.580
It looks like
we've located the threat.

13:55.790 --> 13:58.250
So that's what
you've been doing?
Killer spider robots?

13:58.250 --> 14:00.880
-Stand down.
-Security System:
Authority recognized.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.540
They're part of the school's
new security upgrade.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.210
-Seriously?
-Yes.

14:05.210 --> 14:09.250
San Fransokyo has had a rise
in criminal activity lately.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.500
Perhaps you've noticed.

14:10.500 --> 14:14.210
Not really. I've--
I've been so focused
on my studies.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.460
(chuckles nervously)

14:18.330 --> 14:19.670
Hiro:
Sweet.

14:19.670 --> 14:21.330
So, this is the brains
behind the 'bots?

14:21.330 --> 14:24.750
Yes. I'm programming
the system to detain intruders.

14:24.750 --> 14:27.330
Like, say,
a reckless student

14:27.330 --> 14:28.790
breaking in after-hours.

14:28.790 --> 14:31.290
-(stammering)
Oh, no. I was just--
-Save it, Mr. Hamada!

14:31.290 --> 14:34.000
We'll deal with
your punishment
in the morning.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.330
-But I--
-Not another word,
Mr. Hamada.

14:37.330 --> 14:38.880
(beeping)

14:38.880 --> 14:40.880
Security System:
Threat detected.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.170
Threat detected.

14:42.170 --> 14:43.330
Is it supposed
to do that?

14:43.330 --> 14:45.670
No. Stand down!

14:45.670 --> 14:48.040
Authority not recognized.

14:49.210 --> 14:50.420
(keyboard clacking)

14:50.420 --> 14:52.080
(beeps)

14:52.080 --> 14:53.380
I can't override it.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.500
You must have
triggered the system
before it was ready.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.580
Oh! So it's my fault. Right.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.170
Security System:
Threat detected.

14:59.170 --> 15:00.380
Threat detected.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.170
Wait, the system sees you
as a threat too?

15:02.170 --> 15:03.540
Apparently so.

15:03.540 --> 15:05.460
Oh. Ha-ha.
Great. Um...

15:05.460 --> 15:07.710
(stammering)
I think I can fix the code.

15:07.710 --> 15:09.120
-(both scream)
-(electricity crackling)

15:10.750 --> 15:12.830
-Uh, now what?
-Run!

15:15.790 --> 15:16.920
(gasps)

15:23.000 --> 15:25.420
-(beeps)
- I need backup
at school now!

15:25.420 --> 15:26.670
-Hiro?
-(Granville grunting)

15:26.670 --> 15:29.790
Mr. Hamada! I could use
some assistance!

15:29.790 --> 15:31.210
Wait! Granville's with you?

15:31.210 --> 15:32.880
Don't you think
she'd recognize us?

15:32.880 --> 15:35.000
Nobody recognizes us
in our gear.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.080
-I bet she would.
-Looks like it's up
to you and me, Mini-Max.

15:41.290 --> 15:42.420
I have been programmed

15:42.420 --> 15:45.040
to increase vocal volume
in this situation.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.670
(loudly)
Mini-Maximum justice!

15:48.670 --> 15:51.380
(laughing)
I'm living my best life!

15:51.380 --> 15:53.540
(crickets chirping)

15:57.000 --> 15:58.920
Wait up. Wait up!

16:05.750 --> 16:07.170
Engage glow mode!

16:07.170 --> 16:09.460
Fred:
You're a night-light?
Oh ho! Awesome!

16:09.460 --> 16:10.790
Not to mention,
practical.

16:10.790 --> 16:12.750
(squeaking)

16:12.750 --> 16:14.790
(rat chitters)

16:16.290 --> 16:17.580
Mini-Max:
Show yourself!

16:19.250 --> 16:20.380
Spiders!

16:20.380 --> 16:23.120
Status:
surrounded and outnumbered.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.000
I was built for this!

16:28.460 --> 16:30.080
(electricity crackling)

16:30.080 --> 16:31.460
Hiro might've mentioned
there were spiders.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.330
Mini-Max:
Relax. They are not
organic life-forms.

16:35.420 --> 16:36.960
Electric spiders!

16:36.960 --> 16:40.000
That is a more
accurate assessment!

16:40.000 --> 16:43.040
-(Fred gasps)
-Mini-Maximum rocket fist!

16:44.380 --> 16:46.250
-(Fred groans, slow-motion)
-(electricity crackles)

16:47.580 --> 16:49.210
(explosion)

16:52.380 --> 16:54.330
Thanks for the hand,
Mini-Max.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.380
Get it?
'Cause you used
your actual hand

16:56.380 --> 16:58.380
to give me a hand.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.460
So, Mr. Hamada,
enlighten me.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.710
Why have you
been spying on me?

17:03.710 --> 17:05.380
Spying?

17:05.380 --> 17:07.040
On you?
(laughing nervously)

17:07.040 --> 17:09.460
No, I-I haven't
been spying on you.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.080
Good Luck Alley?

17:12.080 --> 17:14.960
Where I was purchasing parts
for these security bots.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.250
Okay, fine!
I-I've been spying on you.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.500
But for good reason.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.790
I found out
you taught here before.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.380
So, I went to see
Professor Callaghan,

17:22.380 --> 17:24.210
to find out why you left.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.960
I see.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.460
Well, it seems
I have to work harder

17:27.460 --> 17:28.790
to gain your trust.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.830
Why don't I start by telling you
what really happened?

17:31.830 --> 17:35.210
Granville:
There was a young student,
a genius.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.540
I believed without limit,

17:37.540 --> 17:39.580
he would achieve great things.

17:39.580 --> 17:43.500
I granted this young genius
free reign of the lab.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.080
Even after-hours.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.210
I was unaware
that his experiment

17:48.210 --> 17:49.710
was extremely dangerous.

17:49.710 --> 17:51.880
-(electricity charging)
-(explosion)

17:51.880 --> 17:53.790
It went awry.

17:53.790 --> 17:56.080
The boy survived, but barely.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.580
I covered for the student,

17:57.580 --> 17:59.580
telling the authorities
it was my work.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.460
In a way, it was my work.

18:02.460 --> 18:05.420
See, as a teacher, I failed.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.210
Students need limits.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.500
Even geniuses.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.000
-(thuds)
-(Hiro grunts)

18:17.080 --> 18:19.170
-Look out!
-I'm stuck!

18:19.170 --> 18:20.830
(Hiro grunting)

18:23.790 --> 18:26.540
Help! I'm stuck!

18:27.670 --> 18:29.170
-(rapid beeping)
-(Hiro whimpers)

18:29.170 --> 18:30.880
(high-pitched whining)

18:32.380 --> 18:33.580
(Fred grunts)

18:33.580 --> 18:36.000
Mini-Maximum justice!

18:36.000 --> 18:37.420
Security System:
Threat detected.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.210
Threat detected.

18:40.210 --> 18:41.830
-Threat detected.
-(Fred whimpers)

18:41.830 --> 18:44.120
-Threat detected.
-Mini-Maximum punch!

18:49.080 --> 18:52.710
-(Fred whimpering)
-Threat detected.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.710
Fred, distract
the security bots,

18:54.710 --> 18:56.580
while I destroy the CPU.

18:56.580 --> 19:00.710
-(breathing heavily)
-(rapid beeping)

19:00.710 --> 19:02.540
So, they're not spiders.
They're killer robots.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.460
Good. Wait, no!
Is that better?

19:04.460 --> 19:06.170
Mini-Maximum smash!

19:06.170 --> 19:08.210
Mini-Maximum launch!

19:08.210 --> 19:10.460
Mini-Maximum--

19:10.460 --> 19:11.540
Pinned.

19:11.540 --> 19:14.250
You must proceed
heroically without me.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.380
But I don't know
if I can do this without you!

19:16.380 --> 19:19.000
Fred, believe in yourself,
like I do.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.290
-You actually believe in me?
-You're all we've got.

19:22.290 --> 19:24.540
Proppin' up the hero
with clichéd nonsense.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.920
Nice, Mini-Max!

19:25.920 --> 19:27.960
You side-kicked
this situation perfectly!

19:27.960 --> 19:29.580
(groans)

19:29.580 --> 19:30.880
Okay, Fred, think.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.540
How do you defeat
a security system

19:32.540 --> 19:34.880
that thinks everything
is a threat?

19:34.880 --> 19:36.000
By threatening me,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.670
the security system
is a threat to the school,

19:37.670 --> 19:39.750
because I'm there
to protect the school.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.080
So, to defeat all threats
to the school,

19:42.080 --> 19:44.830
the security system
must fight itself.

19:44.830 --> 19:46.670
Security System:
Threat detected.

19:46.670 --> 19:48.040
But if it fights itself,

19:48.040 --> 19:49.330
then that's also a threat,

19:49.330 --> 19:51.120
so it must fight
the part of itself

19:51.120 --> 19:53.920
that's threatening the part
that's not a threat.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.080
Security System:
Fatal logic error.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.170
-Warning. Fatal logic error.
-(rapid beeping)

19:58.170 --> 19:59.960
But the threat in that

19:59.960 --> 20:02.380
is figuring out which is
the non-threatening part.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.670
Security System:
Logic circuit overload.
Logic circuit overload.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.790
-(sizzling)
-(voice slows, stops)

20:07.790 --> 20:09.750
(system powering down)

20:09.750 --> 20:11.290
(grunts)

20:11.290 --> 20:12.460
(grunting)

20:14.880 --> 20:16.500
(thudding)

20:16.500 --> 20:17.580
Fred, you did it!

20:17.580 --> 20:20.500
You confused the
security system so greatly,

20:20.500 --> 20:22.080
it terminated itself!

20:22.080 --> 20:24.540
I did?
I mean, sh-yeah!

20:24.540 --> 20:26.500
It is the Fredzilla way,
you know.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.380
Contrary to previous data,

20:28.380 --> 20:30.290
you are a great hero!

20:30.290 --> 20:31.880
That's my sidekick!

20:31.880 --> 20:34.210
-Mini-Maximum justice!
-Mini-Maximum justice!

20:34.210 --> 20:36.620
(both laughing)

20:36.620 --> 20:38.670
(continues laughing)

20:38.670 --> 20:40.250
You laugh funny.

20:46.290 --> 20:48.750
Uh, that was pretty crazy,
Professor Granville.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.540
Indeed, Mr. Hamada.
Indeed.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.420
Professor, I, uh...

20:53.420 --> 20:55.000
Yes, Mr. Hamada?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.420
I know I take you risks,

20:56.420 --> 20:57.750
and you--
you think I'm reckless.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.000
-(grunts)
-(glass shatters)

20:59.000 --> 21:00.080
(awkward laugh)

21:00.080 --> 21:02.170
Yes. I do.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.790
I just want you to know
I'm not gonna end up like him.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.620
Who?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.080
Your former student.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.170
We're done here, Mr. Hamada.

21:16.380 --> 21:18.710
(glass clinking)

21:24.580 --> 21:26.120
(electricity crackling)

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
(theme music playing)
