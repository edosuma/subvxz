20:11.377 --> 20:13.277
Ohh.

20:13.312 --> 20:15.847
Why did you have to turn out
so great?

20:17.583 --> 20:20.818
I had
two amazing role models.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.321
You have to call me
every day.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.223
Aren't you gonna get sick
of hearing from me?

20:25.258 --> 20:27.725
Well, that's why
I have caller I.D.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.901

you feel better about Eve.

a box fell on them --

20:41.407 --> 20:42.807
put out their eye.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.010
I know
that's not true, Mike,

20:46.045 --> 20:48.079
but it is sweet of you
to say.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.715
Yeah, you know,
- I'm still worried about Eve,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.316
but what did I expect?

20:52.351 --> 20:54.518
We did an incredible job
raising her.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.421
We?
- I did all the heavy lifting.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.692
Yeah. That sweet thing
comes and goes, huh?

Mr. B., Mrs. B.
- Ah.

21:03.896 --> 21:04.863
Kyle.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.266
Isn't that Ed's dog?

21:11.203 --> 21:13.371
Why isn't it blinking?

21:15.641 --> 21:18.243
If you want it to blink,
I'm gonna need another weasel.
