00:01.302 --> 00:02.935
ANNOUNCER:<i> Thanks for</i>
<i>downloading this Fox show.</i>

00:02.937 --> 00:05.738
<i>And don't miss all-new episodes</i>
<i>only on Fox.</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:10.676
Back in the bosom
of Lady Liberty. New York!

00:10.678 --> 00:13.045
Your baby boy's
triumphant return!

00:13.047 --> 00:16.348
Fitzgerald High's Distinguished
Alum of the Year coming through!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.050
Make way!

00:18.052 --> 00:19.651
A lot of energy
after that red-eye.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.821
I feel terrible.
My eyes are all red af...

00:22.823 --> 00:25.290
Oh, I see what they did.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.992
Yeah, I feel normal.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.294
Most nights I sleep
sitting up in my clothes,

00:29.296 --> 00:32.197
holding a plastic cup with
garbage in it anyhow, so...

00:32.199 --> 00:35.034
This is my man, and he
is distinguished, people.

00:35.036 --> 00:38.003
Yes, the high school that once
treated me like a nobody

00:38.005 --> 00:40.172
is finally recognizing me
for what I am.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.040
This is it.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.374
This is all happening.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.476
Comeuppance.
Genuine come up the pants!

00:44.478 --> 00:45.878
Just being back
in New York

00:45.880 --> 00:47.546
is actually a comeback for me.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.449
'Cause the last time
I was here wasn't great.

00:52.853 --> 00:56.221
Aah! Oh!

00:58.059 --> 00:59.591
(screaming, thudding)

00:59.593 --> 01:02.561
(upbeat jazz playing)

01:02.563 --> 01:04.063
(thudding)

01:05.433 --> 01:07.032
I love New York!

01:07.034 --> 01:08.801
¶ ¶

01:10.871 --> 01:13.105
Hey, Mama!
Back! Get back from the curb!

01:13.107 --> 01:15.507
There's maniacs out here!
Well, I'm being
careful, Mom. God!

01:15.509 --> 01:17.109
Thank God you are here, Jess.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.777
I could not get
through a weekend

01:18.779 --> 01:20.779
with Schmidt's mom without you.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.414
Do you know that
she carried him for 11 months?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.549
PADFUNT.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.350
PAD... PADFUNT?

01:25.352 --> 01:27.920
Positivity Always,
Decency Forever,

01:27.922 --> 01:30.556
Understanding
No Trouble.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.459
That's my strategy
for surviving New York.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.928
And that's how
you survive Louise.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.130
Look at my boy!

01:38.132 --> 01:40.299
Are you wearing
suntan lotion?
Yes.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.468
Say hello to your brother.
Oh, hello, Reggie.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.769
Kiss your brother.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.604
What?
Kiss your brother. He loves it!

01:45.606 --> 01:47.473
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
Kiss him! Kiss him on the lips.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.740
He loves it. Come on.
I don't want to, Mama!

01:48.742 --> 01:50.142
Come on, Schmidt.
It's okay. I'll kiss him.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.543
Why would you do that?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.011
He's your husband's
brother. That's gross.

01:54.048 --> 01:56.415
Hey, Louise.
Ah, there she is.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.951
Hey, Schmidt, uh, Nick and I are
gonna grab a cab into the city.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.787
Get one of our famous
extravagant lunches.

02:01.789 --> 02:02.788
Your what?

02:02.790 --> 02:03.956
You know our thing.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.258
We're men of means.
We like nice lunches.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.794
Men of means?
This is New York City.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.130
A city only<i> one </i>
Baldwin can afford.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.931
I would love to
offer up a retort,

02:12.933 --> 02:14.967
but true men of means
are rich in dignity.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.969
Yes, they're also
rich in money.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.971
Just remember
to be back by 7:00.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.507
And it's Fitzgerald
High School in Great Neck.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.808
Sure.
If you can't remember
Great Neck,

02:22.810 --> 02:24.476
that's what they used
to call me in high school,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.478
'cause, well, 'cause
I was dangerously fat,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.347
specifically
in the neck area.
NICK:
We won't forget.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.448
Let's get a cab.
(laughs)

02:29.450 --> 02:31.283
Men of means!
Men of means!

02:31.285 --> 02:34.219
Welcome to Long Island,
the real New York.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.358
This is such
a lovely home, Louise.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.026
Yes, it is.

02:41.028 --> 02:44.129
Who wants Crystal Light?
Oh, me.
Thank you.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.465
That is good. I'd kiss you,
but that would mean

02:46.467 --> 02:48.800
I made out with both
of Schmidt's parents.
(Schmidt groans softly)

02:48.802 --> 02:50.202
JESS:
Yeah.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.137
Good vibes.
Great trip so far.

02:52.139 --> 02:55.207
Welp, I'm gonna go wardrobe prep
for tonight and press my suit.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.142
I'll press it.
Or I... I can press it.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.311
Can you, though?

02:59.313 --> 03:01.046
(whispers):
PADFUNT.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.315
Whew! I am stuffed.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.984
What a lunch.
Expensive but worth it.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.686
I'm still feeling
a bit peckish.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.321
Please, a third lobster at once.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.323
And a telephone on a tray.
Rotary.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.491
(laughs)

03:12.493 --> 03:14.059
BOTH:
Men of means!

03:14.061 --> 03:15.994
It was lavish,
but we deserved it.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.630
80% tip, zero
percent regret.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.667
Ooh, that sounds good.
Hey... keep it up.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.135
Little five spot.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.703
Little crispy Abe!

03:24.705 --> 03:27.306
Hey, today, we are going for it.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.142
(whooping and laughing)

03:31.078 --> 03:32.678
Yeah, man.
You got it?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's,
that's all you right there.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.081
You got it? Man, I
don't have any money.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.483
Yeah.
I need to borrow a little
bit. I spent everything.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.653
I was gonna ask you.
I spent all my cash on lunch.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.989
Well, I only take prepaid
debit cards with me on trips

03:43.991 --> 03:45.524
so I can stick to a budget.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.259
I'm tapped out, man.
Use your credit card.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.494
I don't have
a credit card!
You don't have a credit card?

03:49.496 --> 03:51.863
Once you get one,
you're in their system.
I have zero dollars.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.233
Okay, well, how are we supposed
to get to Long Island?

03:54.235 --> 03:57.236
So, we don't
have any money?
(drumming)

03:57.238 --> 03:59.571
(indistinct
woman's voice over P.A.)

04:03.677 --> 04:05.611
Excuse me?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.946
I put five dollars
in there earlier.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.915
I need to take $4.50 out.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.918
I guess you could say my ears
are bigger than my pockets.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.955
Oh!

04:16.957 --> 04:18.590
Very close to hitting my finger!

04:18.592 --> 04:20.392
Brother, brother, brother.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.593
(laughs)

04:21.595 --> 04:23.595
How you doing,
black man? Black man,

04:23.597 --> 04:25.631
how you...? Aah! Oh!

04:28.469 --> 04:30.235
I got this.
Let me tap in.
(groans)

04:30.237 --> 04:31.770
Black man, black man,
my brother, my brother.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.305
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

04:33.307 --> 04:35.440
Is that the homecoming
welcome package?
Ooh!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.609
I want to see what picture of me
they used.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.944
I sent in, like, 20.
(laughs)

04:38.946 --> 04:40.279
I hope they used the one of me

04:40.281 --> 04:41.780
shaking hands
with Pierce Brosnan.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.283
We really ruined his dinner,
but it was worth it.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.988
What the hell?!

04:49.990 --> 04:52.190
There's, like, 100 honorees.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.794
(sighs)

04:55.796 --> 04:57.796
"An opportunity
for various

04:57.798 --> 04:59.097
"alumni to support

04:59.099 --> 05:00.299
"our dream of purchasing

05:00.301 --> 05:01.967
a new gymnasium scoreboard"?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.603
They're not honoring me.
They're shaking me down!

05:04.605 --> 05:06.338
Of course.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.473
The alumni association is run
by the same jerks

05:08.475 --> 05:11.276
who used to pull this crap on me
back in high school.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.112
Every student council meeting
needs some pizza.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.114
Here you go, Marissa.
My treat.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.482
Cool. Thanks.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.817
You can take off now.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.786
(laughs)
But it's my house.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.454
Mm-hmm.

05:22.456 --> 05:26.291
I'm gonna go for a lap
around the block, then.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.793
The only thing she devoured more

05:27.795 --> 05:29.528
than my pizza was
my self-esteem,

05:29.530 --> 05:31.630
and now she's back for seconds.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.298
Ugh! That's gut-wrenching!

05:33.300 --> 05:34.466
Sorry, sweetheart.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.968
I'm sorry in a way
only a mother could be.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.839
It sucks that it was so cool to
be a bully when we were young.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.207
This is a disaster.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.343
If you need me,
I'll be in my room...

05:44.345 --> 05:46.778
blasting<i> Dookie</i> on cassette.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.315
Wait! Schmidt.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.817
(sighs):
Oh.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.819
Freakin' New York.
(door closes)

05:53.821 --> 05:56.788
Ma, you turned my room
into Reggie's room?!

05:56.790 --> 05:58.790
I hate my brother!

06:02.196 --> 06:03.628
¶ Do you have the time... ¶

06:03.630 --> 06:04.830
You all right in there, baby?

06:04.832 --> 06:07.299
I got this. A mother knows how.

06:07.301 --> 06:09.167
You all right in there, baby?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.303
Let me try.

06:11.305 --> 06:15.974
¶ I am one of those ¶
Schmidt? Schmidt? Schmidt?

06:15.976 --> 06:18.877
¶ Melodramatic fools ¶
Schmidt? Schmidt?

06:18.879 --> 06:22.347
¶ Neurotic to the bone,
no doubt about it ¶
Schmidt?! Schmidt?

06:22.349 --> 06:24.383
Schmidt?
Okay, okay.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.817
(whispers):
Just one more.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.319
¶ Sometimes I give myself... ¶
Schmidt?

06:27.321 --> 06:28.353
SCHMIDT:
Shut up!

06:28.355 --> 06:29.721
(quietly):
Yes, I did it.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.022
Leave me alone, ass hat!

06:31.024 --> 06:32.357
JESS:
I know you didn't mean that.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.725
Is there anything that we can do

06:33.727 --> 06:35.093
to make you feel better
right now?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.695
Schmaegalman's.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.264
Schmaegalman's?
Schmaegalman's
is his favorite deli.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.599
He loves their soup.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.334
He's telling us
he's hungry!

06:42.336 --> 06:43.702
Do you not know
when he's hungry?!

06:43.704 --> 06:45.337
I know when he's
hungry, Louise.
I'll stay here

06:45.339 --> 06:47.873
in case he needs me.
Cece, you go get the soup.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.908
Maybe I should stay here
considering I'm his wife?
Fine.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.843
We'll order in Ling's Palace.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.912
It's fine. It's just fine.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.714
(shouting):
We're getting Ling's Palace

06:55.716 --> 06:57.349
because your wife
won't get Schmaegalman's.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.351
Aah!
Hey, guys.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.420
I want everyone
to have a really great trip.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.089
You both stay here. I'm gonna go
to Schmergerman...

07:04.091 --> 07:05.791
I'm gonna go to Schmaegel...

07:05.793 --> 07:07.392
CECE:
Schmaegalman's. No.
Bagelman's?

07:07.394 --> 07:08.226
Schmaegalman's.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.561
Maegalman's?
Maegal. Yeah.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.430
I'm gonna go to...
to the deli.
Yeah...

07:11.432 --> 07:13.465
You?
Can I borrow your car, please?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.267
If you get so much
as a scratch on it,

07:15.269 --> 07:16.768
you'll never leave New York.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.070
Because you'll be dead.
Because I'll be dead.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.439
You can't handle that deli.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.808
I think I can handle
going to a deli.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.043
(clamoring)

07:27.448 --> 07:29.948
(exhales)
PADFUNT.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.384
I got this.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.419
We got this, man.
Don't worry about it.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.788
We're industrious, you
know? We're resourceful.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.989
Just got to...

07:37.991 --> 07:40.492
(coins jangle)

07:41.462 --> 07:43.128
Hey. Follow my lead.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.097
(chuckles)
¶ Gather round, everybody ¶

07:46.099 --> 07:48.099
¶ Gather round, everybody ¶

07:48.101 --> 07:50.936
(chuckling musically)

07:50.938 --> 07:53.438
They're gathering.
(chuckles) Gather round.
Yes, yes. Yes, indeed.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.974
What's the plan?
We're gonna show
'em our talent.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.309
That's what we're gonna do.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.177
(grunts, chuckles)

07:59.179 --> 08:01.346
What time is it? It's showtime.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.448
What time is it?
It's showtime.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.317
Who wants to see
what he's gonna do?

08:05.319 --> 08:07.185
I do!
'Cause I'm gonna do it.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.454
He's gonna do it!
I'll do it!

08:09.456 --> 08:11.122
NICK:
Got to do it!
Let's do it!

08:11.124 --> 08:14.125
It's honestly time to do it!
Yeah, we're about to!

08:14.127 --> 08:15.827
(chuckling)

08:15.829 --> 08:18.497
Y'all don't want to
miss this! (chuckles)

08:18.499 --> 08:21.466
Yeah. Yeah.
(chuckles) All right,
get ready for showtime!

08:21.468 --> 08:22.467
We gonna do something with this!

08:22.469 --> 08:24.302
Oh, yeah.
This the main event

08:24.304 --> 08:25.971
right here!
(whoops)

08:25.973 --> 08:28.640
WOMAN: The next L train
is now arriving

08:28.642 --> 08:30.542
on the Manhattan track.
What is this?
What is this?

08:35.349 --> 08:37.148
Did it just work?
(chuckles)

08:37.150 --> 08:40.051
Yes, sir, my man,
I think it did!

08:40.053 --> 08:42.821
Let's count up all this loot.

08:42.823 --> 08:46.057
That's several-- see
what we find right here.

08:46.059 --> 08:49.127
Got seventy...
We got 72 cents.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.364
So if we just stall
until the train arrives,

08:52.366 --> 08:55.200
we never have
to do anything.
What time is it?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.068
It's showtime!
What time is it?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.471
It's showtime!
(chuckling musically)

08:59.473 --> 09:02.040
Excuse me, sir.
Is this the line?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.042
(chuckles)
What a New York character.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.077
You're a New York character.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.746
Oh, sorry.
Um, I was just...

09:07.748 --> 09:09.814
getting in line behind you.
(chuckles)

09:09.816 --> 09:11.550
Don't want to get in a pickle.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.885
That's just deli fun. Oh.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.254
There you go, sweetheart.
Okay, there we go!

09:16.256 --> 09:18.890
Hi, do you have special soup...
This is

09:18.892 --> 09:20.425
the cream cheese line. Next.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.494
You're still here?

09:22.496 --> 09:24.429
I'm sorry. I'll just...
Next!

09:24.431 --> 09:25.530
Yes, um...
Too slow!

09:25.532 --> 09:26.364
Next!
Two pounds

09:26.366 --> 09:27.499
of whitefish.

09:27.501 --> 09:28.667
Beautiful baby.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.869
Don't talk to me.
Okay.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.571
MAN:
43, 44, 45, 46...

09:32.573 --> 09:34.506
Oh, yes, um,
may I please have the...
46.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.041
Two black-and-whites.
Oh, uh,

09:36.043 --> 09:37.509
excuse me, I'm 45.
Yeah,

09:37.511 --> 09:38.610
he already called it,
slowpoke.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.245
Here you go.
Welcome to New York.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.613
(chuckles)

09:41.615 --> 09:43.682
¶ ¶

09:48.555 --> 09:49.888
No!

09:49.890 --> 09:52.557
I'm 45!

09:52.559 --> 09:55.560
45 is before 46!

09:55.562 --> 09:57.295
You'll get your damn cookies

09:57.297 --> 10:00.465
when you give me your ass!

10:00.467 --> 10:01.967
(clatter)

10:01.969 --> 10:06.771
One large special soup now!

10:06.773 --> 10:08.740
Schmidt, it's Jess.
I got your soup

10:08.742 --> 10:11.943
but not until I punched
this city in the damn throat.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.712
I thought you were
all about keeping it positive.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.548
That is for sucker MCs
and West Coast punks.

10:16.550 --> 10:19.484
This city's a jungle, so
you better be a freaking lion.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.086
That goes for you, too, Schmidt.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.321
I had an epiphany getting
your soup.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.256
That's what you got to do
tonight.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.625
What are you talking about?

10:26.627 --> 10:28.159
You're a really special guy,

10:28.161 --> 10:29.995
and you got to let everyone
in high school know that.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.097
So you got to go
to that homecoming,

10:32.099 --> 10:33.665
you got to grab that mic,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.333
and you got to roast
that Marissa

10:35.335 --> 10:38.303
and the rest
of those junkyard... fat cats.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.506
I'm gonna tell them all
what I really think of them.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.507
Yeah!

10:42.509 --> 10:43.441
Yeah!

10:43.443 --> 10:45.276
Somebody bring me
an ironing board!

10:45.278 --> 10:48.346
Oh, I got it, babe.
Coming, darling!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.151
What else you got, New York?!

10:53.153 --> 10:55.320
You want to step into me?!
Stop, stop,

10:55.322 --> 10:56.154
stop, stop!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.289
Stop! NYPD!

10:58.291 --> 11:00.625
Ma'am, I need to commandeer
this vehicle.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.193
If you want to commandeer
this vehicle,

11:02.195 --> 11:04.362
then you're gonna have
to commandeer this ass.

11:07.968 --> 11:11.336
Thanks a lot, New York!
(shouts, grunts)

11:11.338 --> 11:12.937
Dude, watch my soup!

11:13.807 --> 11:14.639
(screaming)

11:14.641 --> 11:16.708
(tires screeching)

11:17.678 --> 11:19.678
MAN:
What are you doin'?!

11:19.680 --> 11:21.212
Where'd you learn
to drive?!

11:21.214 --> 11:22.881
Damn it.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.216
You commandeered
my friend's mom's car

11:25.218 --> 11:27.485
and then you crashed it?
That's like me asking

11:27.487 --> 11:31.056
to borrow your dumb cop jacket
and then... just crashing it.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.192
Man, I thought
I had this city licked.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.894
But in the end,
it was me who got licked.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.363
Wait, did that
actually happen?

11:38.365 --> 11:41.232
'Cause there have been some
reported lickings recently,

11:41.234 --> 11:42.734
and if you got a good
look at the guy...

11:42.736 --> 11:44.302
I was obviously speaking
metaphorically.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.970
Right. Me, too. Our
city is wonderful.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.739
It's a great place
to walk around.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.642
So what about
my friend's mom's car?

11:50.644 --> 11:52.644
Let me guess,
there's nothing you can do.

11:52.646 --> 11:55.413
No, ma'am, listen,
everything's gonna be fine.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.149
Just go to the 99th Precinct,
and-- I promise you--

11:58.151 --> 12:00.018
you will be treated
in the most efficient

12:00.020 --> 12:02.687
and pleasant way imaginable.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.323
Proof of ownership.
Liability release.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.758
Waiver of responsibility.
Smog check.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.160
Non-operation
of a boat.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.397
Waiver of somethin'.
Liability release.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.033
Ya-dee-da. Da-dee-da.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.534
And da.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.237
This is an application
to join the NYPD softball team.

12:19.239 --> 12:23.041
You think I like sitting here,
handing you form after form?

12:23.043 --> 12:23.875
Kind of.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.010
You're right. I do.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.480
God, it's like you're in here.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.551
Aw, the train!
What terrible timing.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.386
You're gonna miss the show.
What a drag!

12:35.388 --> 12:37.055
It's crazy, man.
CHARLES:
This is amazing.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.790
Do you guys need volunteers?
Because I'll do it.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.458
I was just telling my son
how I've always dreamed

12:40.460 --> 12:42.894
of being a busker.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.295
Well, guess what.
(chuckles)

12:44.297 --> 12:45.897
You have just
introduced yourself

12:45.899 --> 12:47.899
to the best buskers
in the business.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.735
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a signal problem

12:50.737 --> 12:54.072
at 51st Street, all trains
are currently delayed.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.007
Thank you for your patience.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.612
NICK:
What do we do
now, Winston?

13:00.614 --> 13:02.747
(chuckles)
We are about
to busk, baby.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.949
Okay, you're busking
with the best!

13:04.951 --> 13:07.285
In the most
unbelievable,

13:07.287 --> 13:09.320
I said inconceivable,

13:09.322 --> 13:12.157
unthinkable,
unbelievable,

13:12.159 --> 13:13.158
also unthinkable...

13:13.160 --> 13:14.592
Are you stalling?

13:14.594 --> 13:17.095
(chuckles)
In what world?

13:17.097 --> 13:19.430
In-in-in-in-in-
in-in-in-in-in...

13:19.432 --> 13:21.432
(stammering)

13:21.434 --> 13:23.468
What-what-what-what-what-what-
what-what-what-what...

13:23.470 --> 13:24.502
Jess?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.771
Hey, Cece, I-I know I'm late.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.106
It's this freakin' city.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.607
Huh?
A cop wrecked Louise's car.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.309
I'm waiting to talk
to his captain.
What?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.777
What are you talking
about right now?

13:32.779 --> 13:34.479
Just tell her it's fine.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.614
Did you tell Schmidt
to do a roast tonight?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.116
Funk yeah, I did.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.951
That's how you deal
with this town.
Well, I think

13:39.953 --> 13:42.020
that's a huge mistake.
What, to defend
your husband?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.454
I didn't say that,
Louise.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.623
Mom, how's this?
"In conclusion,

13:45.625 --> 13:47.859
"you're ugly. I make money.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.695
You just got roasted
by the California Kid."

13:50.697 --> 13:53.965
I think it's sensational.
(chuckles) Can you please
just get back here?

13:53.967 --> 13:56.467
We're not ready yet!
We're not ready yet,
'cause I got to do something

13:56.469 --> 13:58.036
that you didn't know
I was about to do.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.672
Do it!
Blow your mind. Oh.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.141
Another piece of the puzzle!
Whoa!

14:03.143 --> 14:05.310
We're taking it to the top!

14:05.312 --> 14:07.378
Do it, do it,
(chanting "Do it!")

14:07.380 --> 14:08.479
do...
Thank you
for starting that chant.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.647
You got it.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.216
Okay, it's, uh... it's looking

14:11.218 --> 14:13.651
like we have to do it.
Okay, I don't know
what "it" is.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.486
"It" is looking
like a jump.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.989
Okay, that is bone-chilling
news. It's too long.

14:17.991 --> 14:21.125
Look, we have no choice, okay?
We got to get to Long Island.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.060
(chanting continues)

14:22.062 --> 14:23.194
We can do it.
We can do it.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.195
All right! Here we go!
Okay! Here we go!

14:24.197 --> 14:25.196
Here we go!

14:25.198 --> 14:26.564
(chanting continues)

14:26.566 --> 14:28.466
On the count of three.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.301
(chanting continues)

14:30.303 --> 14:32.337
One, two, three.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.539
¶ Let this be a moment ¶

14:34.541 --> 14:35.974
(distorted grunt)

14:35.976 --> 14:38.810
¶ A moment you shine ¶

14:38.812 --> 14:40.478
(distorted):
You can do it!

14:40.480 --> 14:43.648
¶ 'Cause you can do anything. ¶

14:43.650 --> 14:46.251
(grunts)
(crowd groans)

14:46.253 --> 14:47.485
(Nick groans)

14:47.487 --> 14:49.687
CHARLES:
That was great.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.489
That was great!

14:51.491 --> 14:52.891
(Nick continuing groaning)

14:52.893 --> 14:54.225
I broke my back.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.664
Winston.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.432
We-Well, your car
should be fixed by morning.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.667
How do I know you're not lying?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.002
I never lie.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.403
Although I told my mother

15:05.405 --> 15:07.739
her hair looked good once...

15:07.741 --> 15:09.240
and it didn't.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.875
Just looked okay.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.510
Okay, I believe you,
even though you're from

15:12.512 --> 15:14.445
the city of garbage water
and pizza trash.
What is

15:14.447 --> 15:15.914
your problem with this city?

15:15.916 --> 15:16.948
(sighs)

15:16.950 --> 15:18.049
I've just never had

15:18.051 --> 15:20.051
a good experience here.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.786
I came here once before

15:21.788 --> 15:24.455
and it was a complete disaster.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.724
Did you go to the opera
and were disappointed?

15:26.726 --> 15:28.393
It's this new director.
No,

15:28.395 --> 15:30.628
I actually...
I had this great week planned,

15:30.630 --> 15:33.731
and then thing after thing
went wrong, and then

15:33.733 --> 15:36.301
I cut my trip off early.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.469
Oh, my God.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.638
(gasps)

15:40.640 --> 15:42.707
Oh, my God.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.444
That's when that was?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.779
Obviously, I don't know,
because I have no idea

15:47.781 --> 15:48.947
what you're talking about.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.616
I left early

15:51.618 --> 15:54.953
and I went home
and surprised my boyfriend.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.990
¶ Who's that girl... ¶

16:00.327 --> 16:02.527
¶ It's Jess. ¶

16:03.630 --> 16:05.430
Spencer was the actual worst.

16:05.432 --> 16:09.100
He called sex "making tacos."

16:09.102 --> 16:12.770
Well, you know
what I always say?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.605
Things happen for a reason...

16:14.607 --> 16:15.807
Yes, and the reason

16:15.809 --> 16:17.942
that New York sucked
was because I was

16:17.944 --> 16:19.777
supposed to catch Spencer,
'cause I wasn't...
No, you didn't let me finish.

16:19.779 --> 16:20.945
supposed to end up with him.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.613
I always say
things happen for a reason,

16:22.615 --> 16:25.183
and that reason
is random chance.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.452
No, you were right
the first time.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.188
New York wasn't
kicking my ass, it was

16:30.190 --> 16:32.457
nudging it, gently,
in the right direction.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.826
(gasps) Just like

16:34.828 --> 16:37.028
you are right now.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.797
Yes.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.199
Yes, that's what's happening.
You can't be mad

16:41.201 --> 16:43.634
at your past--
it makes you who you are.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.304
And, oh, my God.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.639
I told my friend
to do something really stupid,

16:48.641 --> 16:50.174
and I have to go stop him.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.344
Hey, do you want to do something
very, super considerate?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.812
We can't provide you
with a police escort.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.048
I wasn't gonna ask that.
Yeah, you were.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.216
Yeah, I was.
But here:

16:58.218 --> 16:59.484
my lunch.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.386
It's not Schmaegalman's,
but take it.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.221
It's Ling's Palace.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.356
It's fine.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.026
It's just fine.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.801
Oh, Dragon!
Did I miss it?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.236
Uh-uh. It's cool.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.371
That's a really
realistic-looking costume,

17:20.373 --> 17:21.672
with the smoke
and everything.
Yeah.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.574
Oh, you're just hotboxing.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.643
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a vice principal.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.911
Oh!
Hey...

17:26.913 --> 17:29.847
Oh!

17:29.849 --> 17:31.049
You're a mess, dude.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.517
(laughs)

17:32.519 --> 17:34.886
And with Fitzgerald High's
new scoreboard,

17:34.888 --> 17:38.189
we can make Great Neck
great again.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.624
(laughs)

17:41.027 --> 17:42.326
JESS:
Wait, wait,

17:42.328 --> 17:44.762
Schmidt.
What? What,
is my makeup too thick?

17:44.764 --> 17:47.732
What? No, no, you look great.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.001
Uh, look, you can't do this.
I was wrong.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.570
Wh... What are you talking
about? This was your idea.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.739
I know. But I was wrong.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.340
You can't be mad
at these people.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.942
But they were all
horrible to me, Jess.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.510
And that's why you left.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.013
You created
your own path.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.281
You changed cities.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.615
You made friends.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.518
You found your purpose.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.287
You met the love of your life.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.721
I sure did.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.557
Just enjoy your evening.

18:12.559 --> 18:16.561
You know, you have nothing
to say to these people.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.831
If anything-- thank you.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.235
I can't wait to see the look
on Schmidt's face

18:24.237 --> 18:25.736
when he realizes we made it.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.405
Well, he wanted us to make it.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.407
As I was saying, though, I can't
wait to see the look on his face

18:29.409 --> 18:31.209
when he realizes that we
made it, though, right?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.377
That's just gonna be like, "Oh."
I know, but...

18:33.379 --> 18:35.746
just be exc... Yeah, I can't
wait, though, right?

18:35.748 --> 18:38.249
Okay?
We can't<i> score</i> without you.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.250
(laughs)

18:39.252 --> 18:41.819
Whoa. Hello.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.956
Is this Schmidt? What...
what are you doing?

18:44.958 --> 18:48.292
Um... (clears throat) Excuse me,
Marissa, I'm very sorry.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.428
I... I would
just be remiss

18:50.430 --> 18:52.530
if I let this moment
pass me by.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.267
You know, I'm a lucky man.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.269
Because I wouldn't be the man

18:58.271 --> 18:59.637
that I am today

18:59.639 --> 19:01.973
if it weren't
for the experiences

19:01.975 --> 19:03.708
that I've had right here.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.912
So, thank you...

19:07.914 --> 19:09.580
for being the worst

19:09.582 --> 19:11.916
that humankind has to offer.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.452
That includes Harvey Levin
and every cast member

19:14.454 --> 19:16.954
that's ever been on<i> The Real</i>
<i>World/Road Rules Challenge.</i>

19:16.956 --> 19:19.524
Thank you for showing me
that athletic apparel

19:19.526 --> 19:22.026
is something that should never
be worn outside the house,

19:22.028 --> 19:24.028
you chubby-thumbed
pickle hoarders.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.363
And in conclusion,

19:25.365 --> 19:27.365
you're all ugly.
I make money.

19:27.367 --> 19:31.035
You just got roasted
by the California Kid. I did it!

19:36.509 --> 19:38.976
Oh, you sure do talk a lot
when your mouth isn't full...

19:38.978 --> 19:40.378
Great Neck.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.679
(laughter)

19:41.681 --> 19:43.881
Thank you, Schmidt.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.318
Boy, that was real
embarrassing for you, huh?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.387
They're taunting my baby.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.658
This is not good.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.725
(gasps)

19:58.031 --> 19:59.297
Allow me to
introduce myself.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.533
My name is Cece Schmidt.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.402
So if any of you have

20:04.404 --> 20:07.038
anything else you'd like to say
to<i> my</i> husband,

20:07.040 --> 20:10.208
I will drag you
outside and we will

20:10.210 --> 20:12.243
handle this L.A. style.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.978
I will take you

20:13.980 --> 20:18.015
to the corner
of Fairfax and La Brea.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.017
Those are parallel streets.
I'm not telling her that.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.452
That's my daughter!
(crowd booing)

20:25.358 --> 20:26.857
We have to leave.
Where's my car?

20:26.859 --> 20:29.393
Even though your car
is definitely here,

20:29.395 --> 20:31.362
it's a beautiful night--
let's walk.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.231
Okay, look, she clearly did
something weird with your car,

20:33.233 --> 20:35.700
but I got something.
Trust us.
CECE: Sepulveda!

20:35.702 --> 20:38.236
La Cienega, bitches.
El Matador beach.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.538
You're just naming places
in Southern California.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.906
CECE:
Nickel Canyon!

20:44.043 --> 20:45.443
What the...

20:46.746 --> 20:48.179
Told you we were men of means.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.447
Men of means!

20:49.449 --> 20:51.048
(all cheering)
Yeah!

20:51.050 --> 20:52.917
That's what
I'm talking about!
All right!

20:52.919 --> 20:54.619
WINSTON:
Scoot over, scoot over,
I can't fit.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.387
Later, bro...
Tell 'em this story, Denny.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.556
Okay.
Tell 'em all!

20:58.558 --> 20:59.890
You guys have a good time.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.927
All right. Uh...
(grunts)

21:02.929 --> 21:05.229
Oh, man, I'm a mess.

21:05.231 --> 21:08.032
God, it's a perfect
fall New York day.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.800
I'm almost sorry we're leaving.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.369
COACH:
What the hell is going on?!

21:12.639 --> 21:14.805
Were you not gonna call me?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.307
How long you been here?

21:16.309 --> 21:17.908
We literally just got here.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.777
Well, we were gonna go...
I had a, uh...

21:19.779 --> 21:21.545
If I wasn't--
if I didn't just run into you,

21:21.547 --> 21:23.247
you guys would have just been...

21:23.249 --> 21:25.816
¶ Ooh... ¶

21:25.818 --> 21:27.585
The only reason
I'm not<i> pissed</i> is because

21:27.587 --> 21:29.287
I've been to L.A.,
like, five times,

21:29.289 --> 21:30.788
so we're good. Come on.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.923
ALL: Ah!

21:32.925 --> 21:35.259
I got other friends.

21:35.261 --> 21:38.262
<i> Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.</i>

21:38.264 --> 21:41.232
