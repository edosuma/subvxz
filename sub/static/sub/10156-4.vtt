00:50.115 --> 00:52.559
Want to know how the trick is done?

00:53.140 --> 00:55.739
<i>Du bist ein strohmann.</i>

00:55.740 --> 00:58.819
It's a straw man operation.
You are the straw man.

00:58.820 --> 01:00.020
No offence.

01:02.191 --> 01:03.791
Your name is Andrew Birch.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.373
You are a merchant venturer,

01:07.460 --> 01:09.299
decent history in commerce,

01:09.300 --> 01:11.614
no skeletons, no murky deals.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.279
Maybe you and I have done deals
together, maybe we haven't.

01:14.304 --> 01:15.784
Let them guess.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.039
So, I go to the clowns,

01:18.040 --> 01:19.999
the brokers, venture boys,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.559
flexible banks and I
say, "This fellow Birch,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.439
"he's a very smart cookie,

01:24.440 --> 01:26.239
"brilliant plan.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.439
"Just needs backing.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.399
"Something to do with
agricultural hardware.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.719
"Quick profits. He's my gift to you.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.028
"He's clever. He's handsome.

01:37.132 --> 01:40.092
"He's good with all the right people.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.799
"Didn't want you missing out.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.391
"The Company is called Tradepass.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.672
"Double your money in four months, max."

01:50.440 --> 01:51.920
It's trust Dicky time.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.399
And they do.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.440
Well...

01:57.800 --> 02:00.799
We register the company in
Cyprus. You have a bank in Geneva.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.767
No questions asked, no
accounts to be filed. You...

02:04.680 --> 02:05.880
...are my lead actor.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.320
You're my main man, my star.

02:10.568 --> 02:13.439
We make the deal. No-one
really knows what we're selling.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.079
No-one wants to know. They don't care.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.759
All they care about is the money.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.639
They don't want to know what's
really at stake, because if they did

02:20.640 --> 02:22.400
they wouldn't sleep at night.

02:23.692 --> 02:26.652
No-one can know where
the money comes from

02:26.824 --> 02:28.909
except you and me, Andrew.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.840
We know.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.159
It's 11 o'clock.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.919
We're having a business meeting,
darling. I thought I told you.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.559
A business meeting with Thomas?

02:43.560 --> 02:45.399
Not Thomas.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.999
Andrew.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.359
Andrew is coming aboard.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.000
Well, I'm not part of your little
venture, so what do I call you?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.599
Your son is leaving,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.180
if you'd like to take him to the airport.

02:57.205 --> 02:59.526
Oh, bloody hell.

03:01.518 --> 03:03.478
Come here.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.618
Hello, what's this?

03:07.165 --> 03:09.040
It's a goodbye present.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.885
My, God! Boy's got talent.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.198
My son, the painter.

03:18.821 --> 03:20.101
Very good, Danny.

03:20.226 --> 03:23.026
It certainly is. That's
terrific, Dans, thank you.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.279
Now, better get a move on.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.439
Aren't you coming?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.480
Can't, I'm afraid. Work.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.826
Give your old man a hug.

03:32.608 --> 03:34.399
Jed'll take you to the airport

03:34.400 --> 03:37.039
and your mother will be at the other end.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.559
Come on now,

03:38.560 --> 03:39.720
chin up.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.800
Goodbye, Thomas.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.750
- Bye, Danny.
- He's not Thomas any more.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.795
He's Andrew.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.119
- Jed, darling...
- But I'm still Jed

03:51.120 --> 03:52.840
and your dad's still your dad so...

03:54.400 --> 03:55.440
Is that right?

03:56.960 --> 03:58.040
Come on, baby.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.748
_

04:19.452 --> 04:21.298
_

04:21.322 --> 04:22.588
_

04:22.612 --> 04:25.249
_

04:26.186 --> 04:27.626
<i>Gracias.</i>

04:32.880 --> 04:34.199
What do you want?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.400
Please sit down.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.785
Your girlfriend tells me you're
going to take her to Istanbul.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.880
- Very romantic.
- I did what you asked.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.640
And how's the sleeping?

04:51.061 --> 04:54.981
Still bad. You are not
good as a confessor at all.

04:55.006 --> 04:58.640
One good deed at a time. Isn't
that what the good Lord says?

05:02.560 --> 05:03.999
Where did you get this?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.880
- Lucky dip.
- Don't bullshit me.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.400
Who got you this?

05:14.600 --> 05:16.119
Someone on the inside?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.959
Don't make trouble with me Juan.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.199
I'd much prefer to be your friend.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.000
I think you would prefer it, too.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.639
Now look here. I've got code
names and I've got numbers

05:26.640 --> 05:28.220
and I've got pages to cross-reference,

05:28.245 --> 05:31.559
but what I don't have is
someone to join the dots for me

05:31.560 --> 05:34.040
and tell me what the
bloody hell is going on.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.320
Will you leave me alone?

05:41.320 --> 05:43.102
You have my word.

06:36.732 --> 06:39.140
Jesus Christ.

06:40.546 --> 06:43.360
- What is wrong with you?
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

06:44.680 --> 06:45.840
No-one saw me.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.159
You saw no-one see you.
It's not the same thing.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.240
Where's Roper?

06:51.520 --> 06:54.920
He left last night for
a meeting in Geneva.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.823
Jesus.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.159
I really don't think
this was a good idea.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.879
I'm sorry if my recklessness upsets you.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.929
Just tell me what you were
doing in his private study.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.960
Same as you.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.072
I just wanted to find out more
about the man who's employing me.

07:30.097 --> 07:31.775
I'm not employed by anyone.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.839
No?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.728
I'm in a relationship, Andrew.

07:34.753 --> 07:37.095
Business or pleasure?

07:38.120 --> 07:39.360
Love.

07:40.809 --> 07:41.969
Right.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.960
Is this your son?

08:03.331 --> 08:04.531
Why do you have that?

08:04.640 --> 08:05.680
Is it your son?

08:06.579 --> 08:08.259
Yes.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.640
Where is he?

08:11.295 --> 08:14.375
He lives with my sister.
She takes care of him.

08:14.609 --> 08:16.169
Well, why isn't he here with you?

08:16.194 --> 08:17.756
Because I left him.

08:19.953 --> 08:23.193
I was 17, I couldn't be a mother.

08:23.218 --> 08:26.178
My sister had a kid already and
her husband's a really nice guy.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.852
He doesn't do meth for breakfast,
so I think I made the right call.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.760
Does Roper know?

08:35.346 --> 08:37.066
He wasn't supposed to know.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.719
Why?

08:38.720 --> 08:41.880
Because that's not what he
bought on the Upper East Side.

08:43.668 --> 08:46.028
I'm young and beautiful.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.560
Remember?

08:51.490 --> 08:54.050
So why are you here?
Why'd you come and see me?

08:55.465 --> 08:57.545
You know, I actually have no idea.

09:05.786 --> 09:07.786
What do you want from us?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.599
Jed, I'm not your way out of this.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.200
That's not what I'm asking.

09:13.905 --> 09:15.145
I think you should go.

09:16.977 --> 09:19.112
Go home along the beach.

09:19.853 --> 09:21.413
Make sure...

09:42.777 --> 09:44.617
If anyone asks,

09:44.680 --> 09:48.086
say you couldn't sleep and you
went for a night-time stroll.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.200
Make sure they see you.

09:56.108 --> 09:57.756
Be nice to Roper.

10:00.570 --> 10:01.960
Make him happy.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.840
Make him believe it.

10:09.218 --> 10:11.218
Why the hell would I listen to you?

10:40.127 --> 10:42.417
_

10:46.987 --> 10:48.626
Come on, mate.

10:50.869 --> 10:52.526
Unbelievable!

10:55.960 --> 10:57.160
What are you...?

11:02.982 --> 11:04.142
Jesus!

11:16.720 --> 11:18.159
Right, look.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.048
Investors in Trade Pass,
translated by the Spaniard.

11:21.073 --> 11:23.159
Names on the left, numbers on the right.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.774
So Roper buys MOD-certified
weapons for $300 million,

11:28.799 --> 11:31.891
is cash-flowed by people who know
nothing about what they're trading in,

11:31.916 --> 11:35.720
but the investors are guaranteed
20% profit at the end of 12 months.

11:35.745 --> 11:39.135
So Roper pays back 360
million at the end of the deal,

11:39.160 --> 11:41.439
but look what he sells it for.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.759
What's that?

11:42.760 --> 11:45.399
Estimated sale price.
His dad was an auctioneer.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.026
- That's a profit of 240 million.
- Yeah.

11:48.051 --> 11:50.731
It's not bad for a year's
work. And look at this.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.303
Who are Halo and Felix?

12:00.358 --> 12:03.100
- There we are.
- Rob Singhal, IEA.

12:03.720 --> 12:04.841
'Course.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.439
It's Mayhew.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.479
I think he's on the warpath.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.480
An unmarked van forcing me off the Mall.

12:12.582 --> 12:14.422
Is this what it's come to?

12:14.447 --> 12:16.517
This is London, for Christ's sake!

12:16.542 --> 12:18.697
- They were probably trying to scare you.
- They picked the wrong man.

12:18.722 --> 12:21.070
They'll get a Whitehall
knife-fight like they've never seen.

12:21.095 --> 12:22.485
Your budget is tripled.

12:22.510 --> 12:24.533
Don't ask me where I got it
from... best you don't know.

12:24.557 --> 12:26.126
How many more people do you want?

12:26.173 --> 12:29.638
Iintelligence-gathering, analysis,
six minimum. People I can trust.

12:29.663 --> 12:30.976
You choose them. You choose everything.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.437
And get Steadman back here.
Tell him we're joining forces.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.897
You get a new kit. New everything.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.121
OK. Rex, you need to sit
down. Can I show you something?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.600
Where did you get this?

12:49.857 --> 12:51.657
Rex, who are Halo and Felix?

12:55.720 --> 12:57.080
I don't know.

12:58.039 --> 12:59.876
Could you make a guess?

13:34.410 --> 13:35.650
Good trip?

13:35.675 --> 13:36.995
It was all right.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.560
It was all right?

13:41.204 --> 13:43.367
Two days of meetings
with Swiss bankers, Corky.

13:43.392 --> 13:45.227
Wasn't exactly Babylonian.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.599
Andrew!

13:47.600 --> 13:50.279
I didn't get you a snowglobe,
if that's what you're wondering.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.964
How's the homework coming?

13:51.989 --> 13:53.824
Uh... it's pretty good, I think.

13:53.849 --> 13:55.472
Oh. Better be.

13:55.496 --> 13:57.319
I'm going to be testing you.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.760
Where's Jed?

13:59.038 --> 14:00.279
I'm don't know, actually.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.326
I haven't seen much of her, to be honest.

14:02.913 --> 14:04.968
Ah. Thar she blows...

14:08.041 --> 14:09.365
Jed, darling.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.000
I'm sorry.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.545
I'm sorry, too.

14:30.266 --> 14:33.786
Come on, I want to show
you how much I missed you.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.320
Andrew...

14:35.444 --> 14:36.993
Top floor. One hour.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.360
So you're joining up.

14:50.935 --> 14:54.895
Send the kid back to Mummy,
and then it's off to work we go.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.119
Right.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.439
Thanks to some very clever footwork

14:59.440 --> 15:02.159
by some queens unfriendly to the cause,

15:02.160 --> 15:04.600
you're going in my place.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.351
Corky, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:06.376 --> 15:11.114
You see, the chief, though he'll
deny it, is an incurable romantic,

15:11.139 --> 15:14.404
whereas Corky here is a sceptic.

15:14.800 --> 15:18.289
And my professional and personal view is,

15:18.314 --> 15:19.998
you are poison.

15:21.160 --> 15:25.479
But you saved his little boy's
life, so you're Mr Untouchable.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.080
I think one's becoming
a tad deranged, Corky.

15:28.140 --> 15:30.860
And then of course there's the
case of the night-time naughties

15:30.885 --> 15:32.413
while Roper was away.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.759
"Barefoot she walked

15:35.760 --> 15:37.039
"along the beach,

15:37.040 --> 15:40.136
"to the old cottage
where the hero awaits."

15:40.840 --> 15:43.917
Now if that isn't an airport
novel waiting to be written...

15:45.480 --> 15:47.319
She came for advice, that's all.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.840
Do you have any idea
what he'd do to her...

15:49.988 --> 15:51.028
if he knew?

15:52.671 --> 15:56.123
The damage he would do to
that beautiful, sweet face?

15:57.160 --> 16:00.039
Even Dr Shimon, Mr Plastic Fantastic

16:00.040 --> 16:02.039
might find that a bit of a challenge.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.160
That's the fire you're dealing with.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.799
Or don't you care?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.839
Huh?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.440
Of course I care.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.160
Well, good.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.893
Well, then, don't ever
go near that girl...

16:18.612 --> 16:19.692
...again.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.172
Waist to floor, 45.

16:36.197 --> 16:38.237
Please turn around, sir.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.319
Thigh, 23.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.760
Please turn around, sir.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.160
Chest, 41.

16:56.879 --> 16:58.799
Waist, 32 and a half.

16:58.824 --> 17:00.039
Please turn around, sir.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.733
I do believe the tree-trunk
has filled out a little.

17:02.758 --> 17:04.655
You been raiding the
fridge while I was gone?

17:04.680 --> 17:07.478
Well... I was laying in supplies.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.319
All right, so we'll take two of those,

17:10.319 --> 17:12.416
one of the birdseye,

17:12.442 --> 17:15.222
Prince of Wales, and then one in
the grey. What was that called?

17:15.247 --> 17:17.759
- Er, Super 100, sir.
- Super 100.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.719
Yes. Now, can you do
all that by Wednesday,

17:19.720 --> 17:23.079
because Mr Birch is embarking
on a very important trip.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.941
Of course, Mr Roper.

17:27.348 --> 17:29.668
Ah, Jed, darling. Come and see our boy.

17:30.769 --> 17:32.009
Doesn't he look grown-up?

17:33.240 --> 17:35.200
Very nice.

17:35.431 --> 17:36.471
Thank you.

17:36.496 --> 17:37.879
All right.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.400
Time to pay the man, Andrew.

17:39.737 --> 17:42.057
Er... we can charge all this
to your account, Mr Roper.

17:42.082 --> 17:44.227
No, no, no, no. Mr Birch
will pay for his own clothes,

17:44.252 --> 17:45.492
won't you, Mr Birch?

17:46.631 --> 17:47.831
<i>Voila.</i>

18:17.479 --> 18:19.526
_

18:19.572 --> 18:22.892
This is a farewell to my love,

18:22.917 --> 18:28.049
who after a night of wine, song,
and assorted pleasures of the flesh,

18:28.074 --> 18:30.440
will be returning to
the villa with Corky here

18:30.465 --> 18:32.358
while we continue with our journey

18:32.383 --> 18:34.585
with our new friend and
colleague, Andrew Birch.

18:34.610 --> 18:36.359
- Andrew Birch.
- Thank you very much.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.759
Andrew Birch.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.239
Who's hungry?

18:39.240 --> 18:41.219
- I am, Boss.
- I can see that, yes!

18:44.280 --> 18:45.920
Where are you going tomorrow?

18:46.146 --> 18:47.666
I don't know.

18:47.891 --> 18:49.559
Sir, would you like to order?

18:49.560 --> 18:53.037
Er... why don't you just
bring us a mass of seafood?

18:53.062 --> 18:57.039
Er... clams, squid, oysters et cetera.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.239
Get rid of these bloody
flowers, will you?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.519
Yes, of course.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.679
<i>Las flores, por favor.</i>

19:02.680 --> 19:04.439
I'd like a lobster salad, please.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.519
Oh, I'm afraid we don't
have any more lobster, madam.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.685
- What do you mean there's no lobster?
- It's fine.

19:12.709 --> 19:13.799
Sir, I'm sorry.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.559
I'm sorry... So you so should be.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.560
What is this out here?

19:18.742 --> 19:20.142
This is the sea.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.439
This is a seafood restaurant.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.039
There are many lobster living out here,

19:25.040 --> 19:29.878
very happy, laughing at
your three Michelin stars.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.319
Corky, do shut up.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.959
It's fine. I'll have the fish, thanks.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.744
Do you have fish in your
fish seafood restaurant?

19:35.769 --> 19:37.693
Yes, we do, sir.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.279
Oh, I would like to make a toast.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.880
To the lovers.

19:53.290 --> 19:54.664
The perfect pairing.

19:55.634 --> 19:59.053
Beauty and elegance entwined.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.178
To the lovers!

20:02.320 --> 20:04.720
- The lovers!
- The lovers!

20:06.024 --> 20:08.984
Let no man tear them asunder.

20:14.111 --> 20:15.439
What's wrong, baby?

20:15.440 --> 20:16.479
Nothing.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.799
Business?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.039
Of course it's bloody business.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.480
Will you miss me?

20:22.345 --> 20:23.825
Yes, I will miss you.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.450
Why don't you take me with you?

20:25.520 --> 20:26.599
What the hell's that?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.199
What is this? What is this?

20:28.200 --> 20:29.319
Corky, sit down.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.879
It is for another table, sir.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.679
I'll tell you what it is,
my naughty little greaseball.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.319
This is a lobster sodding salad!

20:35.320 --> 20:38.439
Yes, sir. So why did your ugly
friend over there just tell me

20:38.440 --> 20:43.159
that this beautiful lady couldn't
have a lobster-sodding-salad?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.559
They pre-ordered this morning.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.559
Only the lobster salad for pre-orders.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.640
Take your hand off my lobster.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.679
Oh!

20:53.680 --> 20:55.039
Jesus, Corky!

20:55.040 --> 20:57.919
Come on, come on, come on, come on...

20:57.920 --> 21:01.479
- Andrew Birch to the rescue?
- Come on... Come on...

21:01.480 --> 21:04.599
- Where you taking me? Where you taking me?
- Corky...

21:04.600 --> 21:05.935
Come on. Sit down, sit down.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.360
Sit down.

21:08.385 --> 21:09.545
OK?

21:10.466 --> 21:12.958
- It's OK...
- Shhh...

21:14.120 --> 21:16.440
I am so sorry.

21:17.212 --> 21:19.535
- What the hell's going on?
- Andrew Birch.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.587
I must apologise for my
friend's misbehaviour.

21:21.612 --> 21:23.079
I think you bloody well should.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.679
Allow me to buy you lunch.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.678
Perhaps I could re-order the entire
meal, another bottle of champagne...

21:27.702 --> 21:31.013
- What about your friend there?
- You'll have no trouble from him, sir.

21:31.443 --> 21:33.323
Would that be all right?

21:33.377 --> 21:35.337
- Thank you so much.
- I'll take your word for it.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.137
- Yes, sir, thank you.
- OK.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.202
All right.

21:41.845 --> 21:43.414
Isn't he a charmer?

21:46.686 --> 21:48.526
So smooth.

21:48.658 --> 21:50.378
To the victor!

21:50.441 --> 21:52.595
And to the blind man...

21:53.320 --> 21:57.159
...who cannot see the
human bloody hand grenade

21:57.160 --> 22:00.001
in front of his bloody eyes.

22:16.858 --> 22:20.256
_

22:24.818 --> 22:25.889
Thank you.

22:30.982 --> 22:35.100
_

23:08.939 --> 23:10.699
Nice and prompt, Harry.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.975
What are you doing,
contacting me like that?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.719
I was in a hurry.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.063
Do you want to see why?

23:28.960 --> 23:31.480
- Where did you get these?
- Who are Halo and Felix?

23:32.395 --> 23:34.533
It's all right, I'm on my own.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.359
Richard Roper is buying
arms under the counter

23:38.360 --> 23:40.919
from British and American arms companies.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.273
And people on the inside
are aiding and abetting.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.239
And getting paid to do so.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.319
$5 million.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.479
I shouldn't be here.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.135
Sit down, Harry.

23:54.619 --> 23:55.982
Listen to me, Harry.

23:57.291 --> 23:59.400
I like you. I've always liked you.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.440
Ever since I was in the River House.

24:03.882 --> 24:05.271
You're a decent man.

24:06.556 --> 24:08.876
You're just too easily led.

24:08.901 --> 24:11.365
I didn't want to be part of it, I swear.

24:12.022 --> 24:13.520
Who is Halo?

24:16.440 --> 24:18.045
Dromgoole.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.079
So it's...

24:22.080 --> 24:24.880
money to cover all the
River House expenses, yeah?

24:26.040 --> 24:27.280
Including you?

24:31.433 --> 24:32.800
And who's Felix?

24:34.051 --> 24:35.371
Langley in London.

24:37.899 --> 24:39.081
Barbara Vandon.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.280
So what's Dromgoole doing for his money?

24:43.480 --> 24:46.160
Falsifying MOD end-user certificates.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.971
And are you helping him to do that?

24:51.840 --> 24:53.160
Oh, Harry!

24:54.200 --> 24:56.039
That's corruption, it's...

24:56.040 --> 24:59.560
serious fraud, and it's a
gross abuse of government.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.239
And it's a very long custodial sentence,

25:03.240 --> 25:05.595
and a humiliating end to a decent career.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.260
Is that what you really want?

25:10.480 --> 25:11.520
Unless...

25:15.280 --> 25:16.879
King's College library.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.520
Pick them up tomorrow, 10am.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.485
Looking forward to it?

25:26.520 --> 25:27.599
Very much.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.119
Although I'm not quite
sure what "it" is yet.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.528
That's half the fun.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.399
All of the fun, come to think of it.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.440
Yeah?

25:37.851 --> 25:40.295
Nicely dealt with at lunch, by the way.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.959
Thank you.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.359
I suppose drunken guests were meat
and drink to you in the hotel trade.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.680
Yes...

25:50.840 --> 25:52.359
Among other things.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.599
I'm sure.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.319
The mind positively boggles.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.347
Everything all right?

26:04.880 --> 26:05.920
Never better.

26:06.821 --> 26:08.541
We fly tomorrow at ten.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.359
Listen, I need to talk to Sandy.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.839
Can you entertain Jed?

26:11.840 --> 26:13.479
We might be a while.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.599
Jed, darling, the old
codgers need to talk.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.039
Andrew's going to buy you a drink

26:18.040 --> 26:20.679
in that beautiful bar up on the terrace.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.679
And if I were you, I would accept quick.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.000
Looks like there might
be a lot of takers.

26:33.307 --> 26:34.792
When are you back?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.360
I don't know.

26:42.643 --> 26:43.823
Who are you?

26:47.360 --> 26:48.838
You come into our lives...

26:49.520 --> 26:51.360
...disrupt our balance...

26:53.640 --> 26:55.520
...everyone's attracted to you.

26:56.658 --> 26:57.920
Who are you?

27:00.861 --> 27:02.400
Are you Andrew Birch?

27:03.697 --> 27:05.160
Are you Thomas Quince?

27:09.400 --> 27:10.920
Are you Jonathan Pine?

27:11.694 --> 27:12.898
Tell me.

27:15.966 --> 27:17.333
I can't.

27:23.091 --> 27:24.448
How long do we have?

27:26.440 --> 27:27.800
He said a while.

27:30.608 --> 27:31.840
Where's your room?

28:31.524 --> 28:34.239
No way. I don't think
they can have a damn thing.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.919
Doesn't matter what he has. It
matters what he thinks he has.

28:36.920 --> 28:37.959
"He"?

28:37.960 --> 28:38.999
Who "he"?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.839
Fellow called Mayhew.

28:40.840 --> 28:44.119
Tight-arsed Foreign Office creep
trying to make a name for himself.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.199
River boys got him pegged as a nuisance.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.079
I don't know what he already has,
but they're definitely spooked.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.360
What do you want to do?

28:53.042 --> 28:55.399
Call the Haven, bring
the whole thing forward.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.440
Will do.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.639
So what do you make of our new frontman?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.319
Oh, I like him.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.799
He drinks less than Corky,

29:05.800 --> 29:08.319
but doesn't have the same elan.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.199
Still, swings and roundabouts.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.280
You are such a bloody
snob, Lord Langbourne.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.319
Yeah, it's me.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.599
- Just a small change of plan...
- Ah, there you are!

29:19.600 --> 29:21.119
...it's a timing issue and it's...

29:21.120 --> 29:22.839
Thought you might have eloped.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.279
I had a little headache.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.639
My gallant found me a Nurofen, though.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.010
- Did he really?
- Mmm.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.727
Well, that is very decent of him.

29:31.579 --> 29:33.099
No, no, no. No...

29:33.124 --> 29:36.110
I am for my bed, and
you are for my bed, too.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.159
Just in case you'd forgotten,

29:39.160 --> 29:42.319
you and I are not going to see
each other for quite a while.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
See you in the morning, Andrew.

29:44.437 --> 29:47.192
I won't wake to see you
off, so best of luck.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.319
Thank you.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.440
'Night.

30:10.446 --> 30:13.157
_

30:21.480 --> 30:25.320
OK, so we're looking at seven arms
deals, all in the last six months.

30:26.529 --> 30:29.355
Fake MOD end-user certificates,
fast-tracked by the River.

30:29.380 --> 30:30.455
You can see on the certificates

30:30.480 --> 30:32.587
the end users are the
governments of Italy and Bulgaria.

30:32.612 --> 30:34.353
We now know that not to be the case.

30:34.378 --> 30:36.830
They're being exported by a
company called Farrago Holdings.

30:36.855 --> 30:39.639
Export licenses granted, they
can ship when ever they want.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.359
Where did you get these?

30:41.360 --> 30:42.800
A boatman gave them to me.

30:43.648 --> 30:45.439
OK, so the toys are in transit.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.547
The question is: where
are they really going?

30:47.571 --> 30:49.100
And how the hell are they getting there?

30:49.125 --> 30:52.999
We're focusing on three ships:
the Nemesis, the Marquis,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.199
the Leila Jane.

30:54.200 --> 30:58.079
All three were registered in
Cyprus to Farrago Holdings.

30:58.080 --> 31:02.879
Farrago's a front company, it's
impossible to trace the directors.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.199
What's the cargo?

31:04.200 --> 31:05.999
Crops and farm machinery.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.239
All three ships have already
gone off their bearings

31:08.240 --> 31:09.639
in the Atlantic Ocean.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.359
I'd say two are a smokescreen
and one's the real thing.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.719
And what about Roper, Grace?

31:13.720 --> 31:17.079
Well, he was in Palma. He left
on a private jet this morning.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.279
Plane's registered to
Trade Pass Holdings.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.159
Director is Andrew Birch.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.399
Birch? Who's that?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.684
We've run searches on
him, nothing's come back.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.279
Who's on the plane?

31:27.280 --> 31:30.190
Birch, Langbourne and Richard Roper.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.569
- Where's it going?
- Istanbul.

31:34.035 --> 31:37.115
That's where Apostol's
going, the Spanish lawyer.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.599
We need to split units. You
need to get to Istanbul now.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.239
Take Pearl and a team with you.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.519
- What am I looking for?
- A familiar face.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.880
I think Andrew Birch is
someone closer than we think.

31:50.241 --> 31:53.079
Sir, we'll be approaching
Istanbul in around ten minutes.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.319
Thank you, Mags.

31:57.733 --> 31:59.044
You ready to shine?

32:10.425 --> 32:11.712
Come!

32:13.937 --> 32:15.825
- Rex, how are you?
- Emma?

32:15.850 --> 32:17.050
What are you...?

32:18.440 --> 32:19.479
I'm fine.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.520
Good.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.440
Angela Burr from the IEA.

32:24.611 --> 32:26.204
You know her personally?

32:26.873 --> 32:28.033
Er...

32:28.058 --> 32:29.538
A little, yes.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.960
And do you know what she's up to?

32:32.360 --> 32:36.200
Erm... aside from the fact that she's
working on Limpet, not really. Erm...

32:37.543 --> 32:39.359
Micro-management isn't my style.

32:39.360 --> 32:43.027
Well, she's been ruffling
an awful lot of feathers.

32:43.689 --> 32:47.329
I think we should appoint
a new head of the IEA.

32:47.354 --> 32:49.594
I have some suitable candidates.

32:49.619 --> 32:50.960
I particularly like this one.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.679
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.049
Angela Burr is closer
than anyone's ever been

32:56.073 --> 32:57.942
to cracking Richard
Roper's offshore operation.

32:57.967 --> 32:59.079
You really believe that?

32:59.080 --> 33:00.436
I know it, I know it.

33:01.869 --> 33:03.640
I've seen it with my own eyes.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.970
What is it you're not telling me, Rex?

33:17.188 --> 33:20.428
Pamela, if I show you this, it
has to be for your eyes only.

33:21.762 --> 33:23.322
This is operational material.

33:23.347 --> 33:25.347
You know, there are lives at stake.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.160
God.

33:37.050 --> 33:40.050
We know who Halo and Felix are.

33:41.555 --> 33:42.800
All right, then.

33:45.017 --> 33:46.735
Keep Angela Burr where she is.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.199
Yes, Geoffrey, it's Pamela.

34:19.434 --> 34:22.722
_

34:40.960 --> 34:43.518
Dicky, remind me of the
name of that bellydancer.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.599
- Never knew it.
- Bedia?

34:45.600 --> 34:46.639
No.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.079
Andrew Birch.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.568
I have three suites and
two rooms booked in my name.

34:52.592 --> 34:53.632
Of course, sir.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.737
Ahem! Thank you. Excellent.

35:01.660 --> 35:04.220
Here we are, ready for
you, sir. Thank you.

35:04.258 --> 35:06.218
- All done?
- All done.

35:16.676 --> 35:18.316
Boss's office.

35:18.341 --> 35:19.520
Now.

35:35.164 --> 35:37.084
Angela Burr has got hold of these.

35:40.833 --> 35:43.942
- How the hell...?
- We suspect a Spanish involvement.

35:44.418 --> 35:45.898
Which means...

35:46.054 --> 35:47.964
that we have a problem!

36:08.331 --> 36:10.411
What's the matter, Harry? Why the flare?

36:10.436 --> 36:12.316
Dromgoole's got the Trade Pass papers.

36:12.341 --> 36:14.581
He knows they came from you.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.846
How does he think I got them?

36:15.871 --> 36:18.351
He thinks the Spanish lawyer helped you.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.560
Is that what he said?

36:25.440 --> 36:27.039
<i>- Steadman.
- Joel?</i>

36:27.040 --> 36:29.059
Need to get a message to
the Spanish lawyer in Madrid.

36:29.083 --> 36:31.083
Tell him to re-divert to London now.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.397
Sure.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.199
I can't do this,
Angela. I'm not sleeping.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.279
Shut up and listen to me.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.119
How did he get them?
Did they come from Galt?

36:38.120 --> 36:39.958
They came direct to Dromgoole.

36:40.594 --> 36:43.994
- I got the feeling they came from above.
- From above? Is that what he said?

36:50.120 --> 36:52.439
Are you sure it was her?

36:52.440 --> 36:53.639
Who else could it have been?

36:53.640 --> 36:56.359
I said no-one, Rex. I said not a
bloody soul to see those papers.

36:56.360 --> 36:59.334
I was defending you. She was
going to get rid of you, Angela.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.079
What happens now?

37:04.080 --> 37:05.639
I get Apo out, quick-time.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.119
Give him a new ID, new life.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.399
Put it all on him to save Pine.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.641
If it looks like Apo was the only mole
in the operation, we might just be OK.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.595
Yeah, Joel, What is it?

37:16.619 --> 37:19.255
<i>The Spanish lawyer booked a flight
to Istanbul but never made it.</i>

37:19.280 --> 37:22.680
He's not answering his cell and
nobody in his office knows where he is.

37:23.924 --> 37:25.551
I'm heading to Madrid right now.

37:25.574 --> 37:27.574
OK, call me when you get there.

38:06.313 --> 38:07.632
Hello?

38:13.960 --> 38:15.311
Jonathan.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.315
What's wrong?

38:33.218 --> 38:35.498
I just need to know that you're there.

38:41.168 --> 38:43.129
Jed, we have to get off the line.

39:11.915 --> 39:13.839
Where's... Apostol?

39:13.840 --> 39:15.399
Is he meeting us there?

39:15.400 --> 39:17.399
Apo's crocked, I'm afraid.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.479
Looks like he's screwing
his tart somewhere.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.373
We have a Turkish substitute.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.819
But we don't need Apo.

39:23.844 --> 39:25.138
We don't need anyone.

39:25.842 --> 39:28.319
We just need you and me.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.399
Mr Ertun will sign as representative

39:30.400 --> 39:32.799
of Farrago Holdings' full jurisdiction.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.320
I will sign as witness from
the private members' bank.

39:35.345 --> 39:38.008
Mr Langbourne informs me that
Mr Birch will sign for himself

39:38.033 --> 39:40.588
- as director of Trade Pass Limited.
- That's correct, sir.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.687
When would you like to sign?

39:43.240 --> 39:45.160
What's wrong with now?

39:46.200 --> 39:49.318
I have not had time to review
these documents properly.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.799
It is a very complicated process of sale.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.599
The origin of the machinery is unclear.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.879
I'm not even sure when the transfer
of goods is going to take place.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.485
Oh, you don't need to concern
yourself with that now.

39:58.510 --> 39:59.879
Mr Langbourne...

39:59.880 --> 40:01.079
Please.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.839
I was brought on at very late notice.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.205
I need time to study the documents.

40:05.230 --> 40:08.414
Could you ask Mr Apostol to
give me a call on the phone,

40:08.439 --> 40:10.078
explain to me the nature of the deal,

40:10.103 --> 40:11.650
and I'll be happy to proceed.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.679
Mr Apostol is indisposed,

40:13.680 --> 40:16.648
which is why we're here, and
why you're being paid so well.

40:16.673 --> 40:17.697
I'm sorry.

40:17.722 --> 40:19.562
I cannot sign a blank document.

40:21.631 --> 40:23.160
They're not blank.

40:23.318 --> 40:24.958
There are words all over the place.

40:24.983 --> 40:26.231
Look, Mr...

40:26.256 --> 40:27.671
Collins.

40:27.696 --> 40:30.671
Mr Collins, it's blank to me.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.159
Mr Ertun, let me explain.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.392
To be completely honest,

40:35.416 --> 40:38.235
I haven't read the documents either,
and I'm supposed to be signing them.

40:38.260 --> 40:41.519
The choice we have is not to
do the deal today or next week,

40:41.520 --> 40:45.587
the choice we have is to do the
deal today, now, this minute...

40:46.200 --> 40:48.001
...or we don't do the deal at all.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.359
All you need to know

40:50.360 --> 40:54.440
is that Trade Pass is buying farm
machinery from Farrago Holdings.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.520
Er... Frisky?

41:01.540 --> 41:03.681
You see, ultimately, Mr Ertun...

41:04.720 --> 41:06.186
...this is about trust.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.455
I trust you...

41:08.480 --> 41:09.519
and...

41:10.679 --> 41:12.843
...I'm asking you to trust me.

41:14.534 --> 41:15.934
It really is that simple.

41:17.697 --> 41:20.657
We were told you were
the right man for the job.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.479
Perhaps we were wrong.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.519
No, no, no, no.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.600
Wait, wait.

41:27.643 --> 41:28.683
You can trust me.

41:29.538 --> 41:30.698
Good!

41:30.800 --> 41:33.617
Well, let's get those
documents signed, shall we?

41:33.642 --> 41:35.677
Mr Birch is a busy man.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.919
Just before we get to
sign those papers...

41:38.920 --> 41:41.879
To authorise the transfer of
funds from the Trade Pass account,

41:41.880 --> 41:45.679
Mr Birch will be subject
to a biometric verification.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.990
It'll take a minute to
extract your iris scan.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.239
You'll be able to use this later

41:59.264 --> 42:01.676
on your smartphone and your computer.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.640
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

42:06.887 --> 42:08.200
If you sign here...

42:12.840 --> 42:14.439
Do you think I might...

42:14.440 --> 42:17.329
take a look at the
current bank statement?

42:18.849 --> 42:21.009
Don't see why not. It's his company.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.440
Thank you.

42:42.355 --> 42:47.903
_

43:13.560 --> 43:14.599
<i>Ciao.</i>

43:14.600 --> 43:16.000
<i>Ka tev iet.</i>

43:31.520 --> 43:32.933
OK.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.479
We go single file.

43:34.480 --> 43:37.869
Yeah? Keep your hands clear
and visible at all times.

43:37.894 --> 43:40.639
Unbutton your jacket, Sandy. They
want to see we're not carrying.

43:40.640 --> 43:42.831
OK? Right, Sandy, come on.

43:53.706 --> 43:55.706
Lord Langbourne.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.679
Welcome.

43:57.680 --> 44:00.479
Long trip on the high seas, sailor boy?

44:00.480 --> 44:01.799
Yes.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.319
Er... we got a little lost in the ocean.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.907
- But we got here in the end.
- You did.

44:09.932 --> 44:11.243
Who is Mr Birch?

44:12.480 --> 44:14.374
This is Mr Andrew Birch.

44:16.360 --> 44:20.199
You are a great enthusiast for
tractors and agricultural materials?

44:20.200 --> 44:22.079
That's right, yes.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.479
Want to feed the world.

44:23.480 --> 44:24.519
Like Bono.

44:28.785 --> 44:30.453
Let's get on with it, shall we?

44:32.642 --> 44:33.920
This way.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.839
- Could we open this one, please?
- Yeah, OK.

44:58.560 --> 45:01.050
Frisky and Tabby, you
want to pick a couple each,

45:01.074 --> 45:02.784
make sure they're bona fide?

45:27.480 --> 45:28.877
Likey?

45:29.595 --> 45:31.033
Very much.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.835
Wait till you see the rest.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.797
Everything all right with you two?

45:34.822 --> 45:36.039
Yeah, it's all good.

45:36.040 --> 45:37.199
Right...

45:37.200 --> 45:38.800
I think it's signing time.

45:43.095 --> 45:44.910
Yes, good evening, this
is Sandy Langbourne,

45:44.935 --> 45:46.590
Trade Pass, for authorisation.

45:46.615 --> 45:49.347
I'm handing the phone to Mr Andrew Birch.

46:08.376 --> 46:10.680
<i>- Thank you.
- Please put Jan on the line.</i>

46:18.539 --> 46:20.538
<i>The purchase has been authorised,</i>

46:20.563 --> 46:22.282
<i>it's all gone through.</i>

46:25.000 --> 46:26.522
It's all yours, my friends.

46:29.320 --> 46:32.719
And this is for you, Mr Birch.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.199
To seal the deal.

46:34.200 --> 46:37.118
This is the best vodka from my
home town, Daugavpils in Latvia.

46:37.143 --> 46:38.946
- Is it?
- Yeah! But, shh...

46:39.280 --> 46:41.064
This is contraband.

46:43.280 --> 46:44.984
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you!

46:45.009 --> 46:46.479
- I appreciate it.
- Thank you.

46:48.905 --> 46:52.084
Right, let's get this stuff ashore
and onto the trucks, shall we?

46:58.825 --> 47:03.102
So how does it feel knowing
that for the next 24 hours,

47:03.440 --> 47:05.640
you own enough weaponry to start a war?

47:07.877 --> 47:09.160
It feels good.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.399
Sure you won't join me?

47:12.400 --> 47:13.800
No, I'm fine, thank you.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.311
Where are they going?

47:17.938 --> 47:19.578
To the Haven.

47:19.603 --> 47:22.420
We'll fly out there tomorrow.
Buyer will meet us there.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.968
You know, I had my suspicions about you.

47:27.760 --> 47:30.639
Suspicion is, unfortunately,
a tool of my trade.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.840
Corky's jealousy is very infectious.

47:34.124 --> 47:36.839
Though it's not really
jealousy, it's lust.

47:36.840 --> 47:39.000
What he'd give for a night with you.

47:40.435 --> 47:42.475
Actually, I know exactly what he'd give.

47:42.600 --> 47:45.519
'Cos he claims it on expenses.
"Uncorking," he calls it.

47:45.520 --> 47:47.679
Hundred bucks a time.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.199
Probably get it for less here,

47:49.200 --> 47:50.920
seeing as they more or less invented it.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.479
So what's your tipple?

47:53.480 --> 47:54.519
Men? Women?

47:54.520 --> 47:55.559
Young? Old?

47:55.560 --> 47:56.600
Get you anything.

47:57.494 --> 47:58.963
I'm fine...

47:59.104 --> 48:00.424
Thank you, though.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.807
So you don't drink, and you don't screw.

48:04.594 --> 48:07.280
Not sure I can trust a
man with no appetites.

48:08.047 --> 48:09.320
Well...

48:11.680 --> 48:13.359
...you'll have to trust this one.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.680
Don't have to.

48:16.833 --> 48:18.257
I choose to.

48:20.774 --> 48:23.491
_

48:23.855 --> 48:26.609
It's gone midnight. You
should really go home.

48:26.634 --> 48:28.079
I'd rather be here, thank you.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.439
Doesn't your husband mind?

48:29.440 --> 48:30.479
Mind what?

48:30.480 --> 48:33.486
You always being here. I
mean, I know mine would.

48:33.920 --> 48:36.199
My husband knows why I do this.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.320
He knows about the school sports day.

48:39.769 --> 48:40.959
I mean, he shouldn't.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.175
Mr Burr's not cleared
for anything more than...

48:43.200 --> 48:45.999
cooking risotto and taking the bins out.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.295
But I had to tell him
about the school sports day.

48:50.240 --> 48:51.444
Er...

48:52.000 --> 48:55.114
I was in Baghdad in 2003,

48:55.139 --> 48:56.167
and...

48:56.192 --> 48:57.403
I was attached to...

48:58.240 --> 49:00.079
...the United Nations Monitoring,

49:00.080 --> 49:02.559
Verification and Inspection Commission.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.079
Catchy title.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.328
And...

49:05.680 --> 49:07.559
we'd had reports of

49:07.560 --> 49:11.799
an incident in Rayat,
on the Iranian border.

49:11.800 --> 49:15.279
Kurdistan. And the satellites
couldn't make anything of it. So...

49:15.280 --> 49:17.280
the Head of Station sent me.

49:18.842 --> 49:21.583
That's not entirely true,
I volunteered, actually.

49:21.920 --> 49:25.418
Mr Burr was absolutely
furious when he found out.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.723
But, you know, what's
the point otherwise?

49:30.680 --> 49:31.981
And...

49:32.680 --> 49:36.039
when we got there, it was a sports
day, well, it had been a sports day.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.879
You know, running races,
long jump, picnics.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.996
It looked like it had
been a really lovely day.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.600
Until someone had dropped two...

49:44.560 --> 49:46.951
...gas shells on the playing field.

49:48.443 --> 49:51.003
One was sulphur mustard...

49:51.920 --> 49:55.839
...and one was methylphosphonofluoridate.

49:55.840 --> 49:58.839
I don't know how your
organic chemistry is.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.292
Sarin.

50:00.560 --> 50:01.759
Yeah, so...

50:01.760 --> 50:04.079
the idea of the mixture was...

50:04.080 --> 50:06.140
to stop people from getting masks on.

50:07.480 --> 50:11.280
The mustard gas burnt the hands
and faces of the children...

50:13.360 --> 50:14.781
Sorry.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.400
...melted the skin, and...

50:21.640 --> 50:23.691
Which allowed the sarin...

50:24.293 --> 50:26.480
...to attack the breathing muscles.

50:28.259 --> 50:29.694
And a lot of the kids had...

50:30.579 --> 50:33.859
...lung tissue around their
mouths and on their faces.

50:35.280 --> 50:39.280
And that was the first
time I saw Richard Roper.

50:41.640 --> 50:42.680
Roper...

50:43.126 --> 50:44.839
supplied the gas.

50:44.840 --> 50:45.919
No.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.360
No, sorry.

50:47.385 --> 50:49.004
Erm, no, he had nothing to do with it.

50:49.029 --> 50:51.175
Er... No, that's not the point at all.

50:52.694 --> 50:53.734
He...

50:54.647 --> 50:56.268
...started selling...

50:56.960 --> 50:58.559
...sarin...

50:58.560 --> 51:00.040
after that event.

51:02.042 --> 51:03.303
Because of it.

51:05.091 --> 51:08.091
He saw what I saw. He saw...

51:08.200 --> 51:10.999
112 children...

51:11.000 --> 51:15.008
and 58 adults, and he
thought, "Business."

51:16.788 --> 51:19.028
That's the Richard Roper I know.

51:22.240 --> 51:25.909
Yeah. So Mr Burr knows I'm married
to him and I will have his child.

51:25.999 --> 51:28.279
But I have to be here.

51:36.996 --> 51:38.036
Grace speaking.

51:38.816 --> 51:39.856
Yes.

51:40.840 --> 51:43.880
It's Singhal. There's
a problem in Istanbul.

52:00.920 --> 52:01.960
Yeah.

52:22.600 --> 52:25.120
Get in. What the hell do
you think you're playing at?

52:27.800 --> 52:29.040
<i>Jonathan.</i>

52:32.040 --> 52:33.080
<i>What's wrong?</i>

52:34.856 --> 52:37.136
<i>I just need to know that you're there.</i>

52:39.830 --> 52:41.760
<i>Jed, we have to get off the line.</i>

52:43.400 --> 52:45.159
Well?

52:45.160 --> 52:46.279
Well, what?

52:46.280 --> 52:48.679
Well, are you conducting a
relationship with that girl?

52:48.680 --> 52:50.599
What business is that of yours?

52:50.600 --> 52:51.800
Oh, God.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.880
Yes, he's here.

52:55.020 --> 52:56.660
Yes, it's what we suspect.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.119
Pine.

53:01.120 --> 53:04.399
Now, you listen to me, Jonathan.
This is what you are going to do.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.119
You are going to go back to your room,

53:06.120 --> 53:08.279
<i>and you collect your
money and your passport,</i>

53:08.280 --> 53:09.839
and that is it. Do you hear me?

53:09.840 --> 53:12.793
Then you're going to down to the
foyer, where you'll meet Rob and Pearl.

53:12.818 --> 53:15.298
<i>They will put you in a taxi which
will take you back to the airport.</i>

53:15.322 --> 53:16.599
Why would I do that?

53:16.600 --> 53:18.867
We're pulling you out
because you've blown it.

53:18.891 --> 53:19.969
I don't think so.

53:19.970 --> 53:22.584
<i>His girlfriend calls you from Roper's
house phone in the middle of the night,</i>

53:22.609 --> 53:24.719
<i>- and you think you're safe?
- If I leave now,</i>

53:24.720 --> 53:25.759
you have nothing.

53:25.760 --> 53:28.679
I will have you not screwing up my
operation, that's what I'll have.

53:28.680 --> 53:31.159
Without me, you don't have an operation.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.559
<i>The arms were taken off a
boat called the Leila Jane</i>

53:33.560 --> 53:35.199
in Istanbul Harbour late last night.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.719
They're now being taken by road
to a place called the Haven.

53:37.720 --> 53:41.199
<i>If I stay on the inside, I can
take you directly to the arms,</i>

53:41.200 --> 53:44.039
and deliver you Roper and whoever's
buying them, caught in the act.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.342
Without me, you've got nothing.

53:45.366 --> 53:47.703
You don't have Roper in
possession of chemical weapons,

53:47.728 --> 53:51.239
you can't arrest him for corporate fraud,
his name's not connected to Trade Pass.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.827
You have no phone taps, no witnesses.

53:52.852 --> 53:55.589
His deal will go ahead, and
you'll be powerless to stop it.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.599
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

53:59.600 --> 54:01.720
Just leave. That's an order.

54:08.019 --> 54:09.779
The foyer. Five minutes.

54:10.969 --> 54:13.960
_

54:15.887 --> 54:18.701
_

54:47.640 --> 54:49.120
What the hell are you doing?

54:49.145 --> 54:50.535
I need to speak to the chief. Now.

54:50.560 --> 54:52.560
- He's asleep.
- Then get him up.

55:07.160 --> 55:08.679
I'm sorry, boss.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.022
This better be good.

55:13.272 --> 55:14.760
We're being watched.

55:16.074 --> 55:17.065
What do you mean?

55:17.090 --> 55:19.394
There is a British man
and woman in the foyer.

55:19.644 --> 55:23.199
He's Asian, mid 30s, she's 40s,
I'd say, but they're English.

55:23.200 --> 55:25.628
And I'd lay good money
they're law enforcement.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.519
How can you be so sure?

55:27.520 --> 55:30.160
You've been on the run, you
notice these things. Trust me.

55:31.392 --> 55:33.912
- Tabby, check 'em out.
- Yes, sir.

55:52.546 --> 55:54.170
Still waiting.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.879
<i>- Yeah?
- They're police, all right.</i>

55:59.880 --> 56:01.999
Right. I want a full evacuation.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.920
I want all of us all on
the road in ten minutes.

56:08.315 --> 56:09.973
Anybody home?

56:41.930 --> 56:45.159
Guys, you take the front car with
Tabby. Sandy, you get in with me.

56:45.160 --> 56:46.759
Dicky, what the hell's going on?

56:46.760 --> 56:48.439
Coppers. Let's go.

56:48.440 --> 56:49.959
That's the backup.

56:49.960 --> 56:51.255
Get in the car!

56:54.489 --> 56:56.049
Go, go, go, go!

57:04.840 --> 57:06.680
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

57:13.880 --> 57:15.999
I'm fine.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.160
He's gone.
