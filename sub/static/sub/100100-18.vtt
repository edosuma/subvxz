WEBVTT

00:11.098 --> 00:13.230
ALL THERE.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.232
USED UNMARKED BILLS
AS PROMISED.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.495
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.019
YOU'RE NOW THE NEW
PROUD OF OWNER

00:19.062 --> 00:21.499
OF 7 HEARTS,
14 KIDNEYS,

00:21.543 --> 00:24.894
7 LIVERS,
14 LUNGS,

00:24.937 --> 00:26.896
AND 14 CORNEAS.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.732
SOME DISASSEMBLY
REQUIRED.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.396
OOF! AAH!

00:50.746 --> 00:51.616
HUH! AGH!

01:01.148 --> 01:02.627
OVER THERE!
SHE WENT THAT WAY!

01:17.816 --> 01:20.080
UGH!

01:24.475 --> 01:26.608
AAH!

01:37.619 --> 01:38.489
AGH!

01:46.976 --> 01:48.586
I'M JUST SAYING.
LIKE, A BRAID OR
SOMETHING COULD HELP.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.153
I AM NOT WEARING
A BRAID.

01:50.197 --> 01:53.461
CONGRATULATIONS!
ON BEHALF

01:53.504 --> 01:55.419
OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
BOTH LICENSED AND UNLICENSED,

01:55.463 --> 01:58.596
I'D LIKE TO OFFER
MY SINCEREST WHATUP

01:58.640 --> 02:00.294
ON SHUTTING DOWN
THAT CHOP SHOP.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.949
I WASN'T SURE HOW
YOU GUYS CELEBRATED.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.126
USUALLY BY ICING
MY KNUCKLES.

02:06.169 --> 02:10.347
MARY: FOR YOU.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.174
SO THIS IS WHAT
A VICTORY LAP LOOKS LIKE.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.524
TRAFFICKER GOT AWAY,

02:13.568 --> 02:14.960
SOME ASSHAT YANKED
MY WIG,

02:15.004 --> 02:17.485
ALMOST PULLED OFF
MY COWL.

02:17.528 --> 02:18.573
WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED
THAT 30,000 STRANDS

02:18.616 --> 02:20.357
OF GRAB-ME RED HAIR
WOULD BE LIKE

02:20.401 --> 02:21.793
WAVING A FLAG IN FRONT
OF A BULL?

02:21.837 --> 02:24.187
WHAT IF YOU RAN
AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE
THROUGH THE COWL

02:24.231 --> 02:27.538
SO THAT THE NEXT PERSON
WHO TRIED TO GET GRABBY

02:27.582 --> 02:29.975
WOULD HAVE 10,000 VOLTS
OF HANDS OFF?

02:30.019 --> 02:32.326
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
THE THOUGHT

02:32.369 --> 02:33.196
OF WRAPPING MY HEAD
IN LIGHTNING...

02:33.240 --> 02:35.894
RIGHT. DUMB.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.157
UH, I'VE HAD
A FEW OF THESE.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.507
WITHDRAWN.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.682
WE WILL CELEBRATE
AS SOON AS WE GET

02:40.725 --> 02:45.295
THIS ORGAN-STEALING
CREEP BEHIND BARS.

02:45.339 --> 02:52.650
OK. WELL...GO BATTEAM,
WHICH I'M NOT ON...

02:52.694 --> 02:56.001
SO I'M
JUST TAKING THE CHAMPAGNE.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.700
BACKING AWAY. HEH.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.230
THE COWL SHOCK THING
NOT THE WORST IDEA.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.669
SHE WANTS TO BE
PART OF THIS,

03:11.713 --> 03:14.759
AND THE ANSWER IS NO.

03:14.803 --> 03:15.978
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
PART OF THIS

03:16.021 --> 03:18.241
AS MUCH AS SHE WANTS
TO BE PART OF YOUR LIFE.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.330
THEN I WILL TAKE HER
OUT FOR DINNER.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.203
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOUR DAD'S JOURNAL.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.683
IF THAT THING REALLY
IS THE COOKBOOK

03:25.727 --> 03:28.208
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES'
BEST-KEPT SECRETS,

03:28.251 --> 03:28.295
WE NEED TO FIND WHERE
TOMMY ELLIOT HID IT.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.213
SO WHERE DO WE START?

03:33.256 --> 03:35.693
WHICHEVER AISLE'S
THE PROPERTY SEIZED
FROM TOMMY ELLIOT.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.957
HA HA HA! OF COURSE
TOMMY COLLECTED,

03:39.001 --> 03:43.092
LIKE, EVERY
KITTY DELGADO COMIC.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.703
HA HA! OH, MY GOD.

03:45.747 --> 03:48.053
THERE'S NO WAY
A CAT BURGLAR'S SQUEEZING

03:48.097 --> 03:49.881
INTO THOSE TIGHT SPACES
WITH THOSE JUBBLIES.

03:49.925 --> 03:53.885
HMM. HA HA!

03:53.929 --> 03:56.279
SO IF I WERE
THE SMOKING GUN

03:56.323 --> 04:00.283
THAT LINKS TOMMY ELLIOT
TO THE MURDER
OF LUCIUS FOX,

04:00.327 --> 04:00.979
WHERE WOULD I BE?

04:01.023 --> 04:02.720
OH, I DON'T KNOW, LUV,

04:02.764 --> 04:05.767
BUT I HOPE THE CROWS
PAY OVERTIME.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.116
I'LL SETTLE
FOR HAZARD PAY.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.911
TELL ME YOU FOUND
THAT JOURNAL.

04:19.955 --> 04:22.000
WE'VE GONE THROUGH
THE ENTIRE PLACE,

04:22.044 --> 04:24.002
WHICH IS BASICALLY
A SHRINE TO HIS
TWIG AND BERRIES,

04:24.046 --> 04:26.396
BUT ALAS,
NO LUCIUS FOX JOURNAL.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.007
THE GUY OWNED
AT LEAST 40 BUILDINGS
IN GOTHAM ALONE.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.272
WHO KNOWS WHERE
HE COULD HAVE
STASHED IT?

04:32.315 --> 04:34.448
WELL, THERE IS ONE PERSON
WHO KNOWS.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.453
HA HA!

04:45.720 --> 04:49.593
AH. KANDY KANE.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.116
WELL, YOUR--YOUR
REAL ESTATE BUSINESS

04:51.160 --> 04:53.771
MUST REALLY BE TANKING
IF YOU WERE WILLING

04:53.815 --> 04:58.298
TO LET THEM FRISK YOU
FOR, WHAT, A FEW HOW-TOS.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.517
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
TOMMY BOY,

05:00.561 --> 05:02.780
I'M NOT HERE
FOR A MEASURING CONTEST.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.653
OH. THAT'S TOO BAD.

05:05.696 --> 05:09.309
SPEAKING OF BEING
THE BIGGER MAN,

05:09.352 --> 05:11.354
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM BRUCE?

05:11.398 --> 05:12.660
VISITING HOURS ARE
4 DAYS A WEEK.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.532
HE'S A TOTAL NO-SHOW.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.795
IS THAT ANY WAY TO
TREAT YOUR BEST FRIEND?

05:17.839 --> 05:21.408
IT IS IF HE KILLED
HIS ACTUAL BEST FRIEND--
LUCIUS FOX.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.804
THAT'S
AN OUTRAGEOUS LIE.

05:26.848 --> 05:29.459
LUCIUS WAS NEVER
BRUCE'S BEST FRIEND.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.157
OF COURSE THAT WOULD
BE YOUR TAKEAWAY.

05:32.201 --> 05:35.204
WHAT DID LUCIUS FOX
EVER DO FOR BRUCE?

05:35.247 --> 05:37.467
YOU MEAN, BESIDES TURNING
WAYNE R&D

05:37.511 --> 05:41.210
INTO THE WORLD LEADER
IN DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY?

05:41.253 --> 05:44.822
OH, BUT YOU ALREADY
KNEW THAT.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.825
THAT'S WHY YOU
HAD HIM KILLED--
FOR HIS JOURNAL.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.480
YOU WANTED THE KEYS
TO THE CANDY STORE.

05:50.524 --> 05:53.091
WHERE'S THE JOURNAL
NOW, TOMMY?

05:56.530 --> 06:00.490
I MISS--I MISS
MY MOMMY!

06:00.534 --> 06:01.839
CAN I TALK TO HER?

06:01.883 --> 06:04.494
THAT'S OK, TOMMY.
THE GUY YOU HIRED

06:04.538 --> 06:08.672
TO PULL THE TRIGGER,
HE'S HAD A LOT TO SAY.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.195
THANKS OR STOPPING
BY, DOUBLE-K,

06:10.239 --> 06:11.066
AND TELL YOUR COUSIN

06:11.109 --> 06:14.983
THE BELLS ARE ON!

06:29.084 --> 06:30.390
BUTLER: IT'S FINE.
THANK YOU.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.399
GET OUT OF MY CELL.

06:39.442 --> 06:42.140
BUT YOURS IS SO MUCH
ROOMIER THAN MINE,

06:42.184 --> 06:43.881
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE
A VACANCY

06:43.925 --> 06:45.970
WHEN THEY STRAP YOU
TO THE ELECTRIC CHAIR

06:46.014 --> 06:48.059
FOR MURDERING
LUCIUS FOX.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.061
ZZZT! ZZZT!

06:50.105 --> 06:53.717
OH, BUT, ALICE,
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

06:53.761 --> 06:58.548
I'M CRAZY!
100% UNFIT TO STAND TRIAL.

06:58.592 --> 07:02.291
BUTLER: MMM.
NOT ANYMORE, I'M AFRAID.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.248
I GOT A CALL THIS MORNING
FROM A JUDGE

07:03.292 --> 07:06.469
ASKING MY OPINION
IN REGARDS

07:06.513 --> 07:08.253
TO YOUR FITNESS
TO STAND TRIAL.

07:08.297 --> 07:11.474
AS ARKHAM'S
CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER,

07:11.518 --> 07:14.912
I COULD HARDLY LIE,

07:14.956 --> 07:17.088
SO THE CROWS WILL
BE HERE SOON TO COLLECT YOU.

07:17.132 --> 07:22.311
BUT WE CAN HELP YOU.

07:22.354 --> 07:27.316
WHY...WOULD YOU
HELP ME?

07:27.359 --> 07:30.580
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
HELP US.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.582
I COULDN'T HELP BUT
LISTEN IN

07:32.626 --> 07:37.674
TO YOUR LITTLE VISIT
WITH KATE KANE

07:37.718 --> 07:39.502
BECAUSE WHEN MY SISTER
WANTS SOMETHING,

07:39.546 --> 07:40.982
I WANT IT MORE.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.943
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT THE DEARLY DEPARTED
LUCIUS FOX'S JOURNAL

07:45.987 --> 07:48.119
JUST BETWEEN US
BAD GUYS?

07:48.163 --> 07:50.470
I'M SORRY.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.819
ARE YOU TWO
WORKING TOGETHER?

07:51.862 --> 07:54.212
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

07:54.256 --> 07:56.650
YOU CAN ANSWER
THE QUESTION VOLUNTARILY,

07:56.693 --> 07:57.955
OR WE WILL EXTRACT IT.

07:57.999 --> 07:58.390
HEH.

08:03.395 --> 08:07.965
SUPPOSEDLY,
IT'S A FAILSAFE

08:08.009 --> 08:11.708
TO KILL THE BAT
IF THE SUIT EVER GOT
INTO THE WRONG HANDS.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.884
WHY'S BRUCE WAYNE'S
R&D GUY TELLING DEAR DIARY

08:13.928 --> 08:17.018
ABOUT THAT?

08:17.061 --> 08:18.367
BECAUSE BRUCE WAYNE'S
BATMAN.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.332
CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER.

08:27.376 --> 08:32.076
AND NOW I WANT TO KNOW
ALL THE MORE

08:32.120 --> 08:34.514
WHERE IS THE BOOK?

08:34.557 --> 08:36.080
HMM.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.525
I'M JUST DEBATING

08:45.568 --> 08:49.398
SHOULD I HAND IT
OVER TO...

08:49.441 --> 08:52.357
GOTHAM'S MOST
PROLIFIC KILLER

08:52.401 --> 08:53.358
FOR NOTHING
IN RETURN?

08:53.402 --> 08:55.709
GIVE US THE JOURNAL,

08:55.752 --> 08:57.275
AND WE WILL LET YOU
WALK OUT OF HERE.

08:57.319 --> 09:01.236
REALLY? JUST OUT
INTO THE STREET

09:01.279 --> 09:04.021
WHERE EVERY
WANTED POSTER
WILL HAVE MY...

09:04.065 --> 09:06.676
FACE ON IT?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.765
NOT IF WE GET YOU
A NEW ONE.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.942
OH. TCH.

09:11.986 --> 09:15.076
THIS IS WHAT IT'S
LIKE BARTERING
WITH A PSYCHOPATH.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.257
AHEM.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.924
WE CAN MAKE YOU INTO
ANYONE YOU WANT TO BE--

09:36.967 --> 09:43.800
REAL, IMAGINED...

09:43.844 --> 09:46.629
WHOEVER YOUR LITTLE
HEART DESIRES.

09:46.673 --> 09:47.369
SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

09:51.329 --> 09:55.116
YOU CALLED IT.
WHATEVER YOU SAID MUST
HAVE RATTLED TOMMY'S CAGE.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.118
22 MINUTES SINCE
YOU LEFT ARKHAM,

09:57.161 --> 09:58.598
AND THERE'S ALREADY
AN OUTGOING CALL TO...

10:01.644 --> 10:03.428
ADDRESS SAYS
THE LOOKOUT.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.734
ISN'T THAT
JOHNNY SABATINO'S CLUB?

10:04.778 --> 10:08.433
TECHNICALLY, BUT TOMMY
OWNS THE BUILDING.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.653
HMM. RUMOR HAS IT,
THAT SABATINO'S
BEEN LAUNDERING

10:10.697 --> 10:12.742
TOMMY'S MONEY
THROUGH THAT CLUB
FOR YEARS.

10:12.786 --> 10:16.659
THAT IS ONE POSH
LAUNDROMAT.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.662
SABATINO: TOMMY, HOW'S
THE PADDED PALACE, BUDDY?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.446
TOMMY: I'M HOPING TO
MAKE IT A DISTANT MEMORY.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.797
LISTEN. REMEMBER
THAT ITEM I HAD YOU
HOLD ONTO?

10:23.840 --> 10:26.147
HA HA! WHAT? THE ONE
THAT YOU HAD ME BREAK

10:26.190 --> 10:27.017
INTO YOUR OFFICE
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING TO GET

10:27.061 --> 10:29.759
THE NIGHT YOU WERE
ARRESTED?

10:29.803 --> 10:30.673
NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.675
OH, YEAH.
IT'S STILL HERE.

10:32.719 --> 10:36.287
LIVING RENT-FREE.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.854
WELL, IT'S TIME
FOR IT TO COME HOME.

10:50.867 --> 10:54.958
UNDERSTOOD. I'LL BE
IN TOUCH TO WORK OUT
THE DETAILS.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.134
WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW
WHERE THE JOURNAL IS.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.789
YEAH, AT A VERY HIGH FLOOR
OF A MOB-INFESTED NIGHTCLUB.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.183
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO
INFILTRATE THAT?

11:02.226 --> 11:05.534
BY WALKING THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.015
UH-OH. WAIT.
CAN YOU FEEL THAT?

11:08.058 --> 11:10.539
NOPE. FEELING NOTHING.
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

11:10.582 --> 11:12.672
MMM. I THINK YOU
FEEL IT.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.717
I THINK YOU FEEL IT.
MM-HMM.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.501
-OK.
-COME ON. SAY IT.

11:16.545 --> 11:20.375
WE'RE...GOING CLUBBING?

11:20.418 --> 11:21.681
WE'RE GOING CLUBBING.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.378
-SSS!
-YECH.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.254
OK. SO THESE ARE
ALL THE FINALISTS

11:30.298 --> 11:32.343
BECAUSE THEY DELIVER
ON THE SSS

11:32.387 --> 11:34.563
AND BATGADGET
CONCEALMENT

11:34.606 --> 11:37.218
BECAUSE WE WANT TO HIDE
THE GOODS

11:37.261 --> 11:38.436
BUT NOT HIDE THE GOODS,
YOU FEEL ME?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.569
OK. THE GOAL IS
TO BLEND IN.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.703
YEAH, BUT AT THIS PLACE,
STANDING OUT IS BLENDING IN.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.617
I MEAN, THE LOOKOUT IS
THE HOTTEST CLUB
IN GOTHAM--

11:45.661 --> 11:48.055
NO OFFENSE TO YOUR BAR.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.186
IT'S--YOU KNOW, IT'S
MORE OF A LOUNGE.

11:49.230 --> 11:52.363
-MM-HMM.
-AND FORTUNATELY,

11:52.407 --> 11:55.453
YOUR BATBOOTS ARE
BOTH FUNCTIONAL
AND ON TREND.

11:55.497 --> 11:56.759
WHAT'S IN THAT ONE?

11:56.803 --> 11:59.588
OH. THAT IS...

11:59.631 --> 12:00.415
♪ MINE

12:04.898 --> 12:06.595
HA! CHECK IT!

12:06.638 --> 12:11.861
HOW INSANE IS THIS?

12:11.905 --> 12:14.385
OH, BUT IF YOU WANT
TO WEAR IT INSTEAD,
YOU CAN.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.910
-YOU'RE NOT GOING, MARY.
-WHAT?

12:16.953 --> 12:18.128
I'M SORRY.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

12:18.172 --> 12:21.218
DANGEROUS? I HAVE BEEN
POISONED, STABBED,

12:21.262 --> 12:22.567
AND NEARLY
EXSANGUINATED,
AND THE FACT

12:22.611 --> 12:23.786
THAT I HAVE LIVED TO
USE THAT WORD AS A VERB

12:23.830 --> 12:25.048
IS PROOF THAT I CAN
LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.051
THAT PLACE WILL BE
FILLED WITH MOBSTERS.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.574
WHICH IS WHY YOU
NEED BACKUP.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.751
AHEM. I ALREADY HAVE IT.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.234
MARY: I THOUGHT THERE
WEREN'T ANY MORE SPOTS
ON THE BATTEAM.

12:37.278 --> 12:41.108
OH. I'M JUST
AN HONORARY MEMBER, LUV.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.892

SO IMPORTANT

21:29.897 --> 21:32.116

WANTED IT,

21:32.160 --> 21:35.772

UNDERSOLD ME ON ITS VALUE,

22:18.554 --> 22:19.860
WHO CAN YOU TRUST?

22:19.903 --> 22:22.689
HMM. NO ONE.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.169
I ONLY TRUST
IN THE FACT THAT

OH, MY GOD!
MARY, HI!

23:51.299 --> 23:52.169
LUKE, ON COMMS:
OK. I'M IMPRESSED.

23:52.213 --> 23:55.085
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

23:55.129 --> 23:57.740
UM, I WAS ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR YOUR COUSIN.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.438
-OH. COUSIN JOHNNY?
-MMM.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.614
HE'S JUST IN
A SUPERINTENSE
MEETING RIGHT NOW.

24:01.657 --> 24:04.834
OH, I KNOW.
WITH A BUNCH OF HIS...

24:04.878 --> 24:05.618
LUKE: DO NOT SAY,
"CRIME FAMILIES."

24:05.661 --> 24:08.098
-MAFIA BROS.
-MAFIA?

24:08.142 --> 24:09.012
LUKE: YEAH, YOU'RE DEAD.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.624
OR HIS FRAT BROS
OR SOMETHING.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.363
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THE TEXTED ME 911

24:12.407 --> 24:15.454
WITH A BUNCH
OF TYPOS.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.020
ISSUES WITH EMBARRASSING
NOSEBLEEDS FROM THE...

24:19.719 --> 24:22.286
OH! SAY NO MORE.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.288
LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.508
TONES AND I: ♪ THE THINGS YOU
DO BEFORE ♪

24:26.552 --> 24:28.205
REALLY STARTING TO REGRET
THIS DRESS RIGHT NOW.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.512
LUKE: YOU'RE DOING
AWESOME.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.601
SOLD TO VASILY KOSOV.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.473
YOU ARE THE PROUD OWNER
OF BATWOMAN'S

24:34.516 --> 24:37.824
VERY OWN GRAPPLING GUN.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.521
ALL RIGHT. NOW ON
TO THE FINAL ITEM OF THE NIGHT

24:39.565 --> 24:43.307
AND, LET'S FACE IT,
THE REASON YOU'RE ALL HERE.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.484
I GIVE YOU
THE SCARLET KNIGHT HERSELF.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.620
WE'RE GONNA START
THE BIDDING AT $2 MILLION.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.057
2 MILLION.
DO I HAVE 2.5?

24:54.101 --> 24:55.537
HOW ABOUT 3 MILLION?

24:55.581 --> 24:56.669
COME ON.
DO I HAVE 4?

24:56.712 --> 24:58.845
$10 MILLION.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.588
UNH!

25:05.025 --> 25:09.159
SO WHO YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE,

25:09.203 --> 25:10.552
THE BAT'S SIDEKICK?

25:14.382 --> 25:16.166
OHH.

25:16.210 --> 25:16.689
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I TOLD YOU

25:16.732 --> 25:19.430
9 PUNCHES AGO.

25:19.474 --> 25:22.651
I'M NOT WITH BATWOMAN.

25:22.695 --> 25:27.526
I'M WITH THE SPECIAL
RECONNAISSANCE REGIMENT.

25:27.569 --> 25:27.700
WOMAN: THAT'S INTERESTING...

25:31.399 --> 25:32.531
BECAUSE I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE

25:32.574 --> 25:35.011
WITH OUR CONTACT
AT THE SRR.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.404
HE SAYS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
UNDER THEIR EMPLOY

25:36.447 --> 25:39.059
FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS,

25:39.102 --> 25:39.842
SOMETHING ABOUT GOING ROGUE
AND BETRAYING

25:39.886 --> 25:41.278
THE ORGANIZATION'S TRUST.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.895
NOW...LET'S
START FRESH...

25:50.984 --> 25:52.463
SHALL WE?

25:54.901 --> 25:57.425
WHO ARE YOU REALLY
WORKING FOR?

26:15.312 --> 26:18.707
THIS IS A SURPRISE.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.580
USUALLY WHEN THEY SAY
I HAVE A VISITOR,

26:21.623 --> 26:23.233
IT'S FOLLOWED
BY THE WORDS

26:23.277 --> 26:25.888
"JUST KIDDING"

26:25.932 --> 26:28.717
AND A LOT OF LAUGHTER
AT MY EXPENSE.

26:28.761 --> 26:32.634
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PUT
YOURSELF IN HERE,
ALICE, NOT ME.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.942
TECHNICALLY IF WE'RE
SPLITTING HAIRS,

26:35.985 --> 26:38.422
KATE SHOVED ME
INTO THE CELL,

26:38.466 --> 26:41.077
AND YOU HELPED
LOCK THE DOOR,

26:41.121 --> 26:45.081
BUT...WHATEVER LETS
YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.170
TOMMY ELLIOT JUST HANGED
HIMSELF,

26:47.214 --> 26:49.608
OR THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
MEANT TO LOOK LIKE.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.915
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

26:54.787 --> 26:59.661
WHAT DO I KNOW?

26:59.705 --> 27:03.752
I KNOW I DON'T
GIVE TWO HOOTS
ABOUT TOMMY ELLIOT!

27:03.796 --> 27:06.755
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
ANY MOTIVATION
TO HELP YOU,

27:06.799 --> 27:10.150
AND I KNOW IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE

27:10.193 --> 27:12.761
TO HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA
OF BEING LOCKED IN A CAGE

27:12.805 --> 27:15.111
WHEN ONE IS STILL
LOCKED IN A CAGE!

27:15.155 --> 27:18.680
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU
TELL ME THAT BETH WAS
NEVER COMING BACK?

27:18.724 --> 27:21.727
THIS IS ME ADMITTING
THAT YOU WERE RIGHT.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.862
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY DO TO PATIENTS
IN HERE?

27:31.432 --> 27:33.695
THEY PUT ELECTRODES
ON OUR HEADS

27:33.739 --> 27:36.176
AND BLAST US WITH SO
MUCH ELECTRICITY

27:36.219 --> 27:36.655
THAT WE SEIZE.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.792
AND I DON'T KNOW
THE EXACT SCIENCE,

27:43.836 --> 27:49.493
BUT...AFTER ABOUT
10 JOLTS,

27:49.537 --> 27:52.714
LET ME TELL YOU,

27:52.758 --> 27:57.676
YOU START CONVINCING
EVERYONE AROUND YOU
THAT IT WORKED.

27:57.719 --> 28:02.506
I'M SORRY THAT IT
ENDED UP THIS WAY.

28:02.550 --> 28:07.033
IF YOU MEAN THAT,
THEN GET ME OUT
OF HERE.

28:07.076 --> 28:11.341
I CAN'T. I HAVE TO
PROTECT THE DAUGHTERS

28:11.385 --> 28:12.952
THAT I HAVE LEFT.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.744
THE THING THEY DON'T
TELL YOU ABOUT ECT IS

28:22.788 --> 28:27.531
THAT ONCE IT'S OVER

28:27.575 --> 28:31.187
ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS CLARITY.

28:31.231 --> 28:35.844
HA! I SEE
EVERYTHING NOW,

28:35.888 --> 28:39.718
HOW THIS CAME TO BE,

28:39.761 --> 28:42.764
HOW IT WILL END,

28:42.808 --> 28:46.376
AND I PROMISE YOU,
DADDY,

28:46.420 --> 28:48.770
WHAT I HAVE
IN STORE FOR YOU

28:48.814 --> 28:51.207
IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN
A CAGE OR ELECTRODES

28:51.251 --> 28:55.777
OR INSANITY.

28:55.821 --> 29:00.216
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
IT'S...

29:00.260 --> 29:01.087
WORSE THAN BEING ME...

29:04.786 --> 29:04.917
BUT YOU'LL SEE.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.887
SABATINO: WHO ARE YOU?

29:18.931 --> 29:20.933
THE HEIR
TO HAMILTON DYNAMICS,

29:20.976 --> 29:22.630
AND I GOT MONEY
TO SPEND.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.980
LOOK. I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY PERSONAL
VENDETTA

29:25.024 --> 29:27.417
AGAINST BATWOMAN.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.941
WHETHER SHE BLEW UP
A SHIPMENT OF "H"

29:28.984 --> 29:31.813
OR BATARANGED
YOUR DOG, I DON'T
GIVE A FEEL.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.815
HAMILTON DYNAMICS
WANTS THE TECHNOLOGY
IN THAT SUIT,

29:33.859 --> 29:36.644
AND WE'RE WILLING
TO PAY HANDSOMELY
FOR IT.

29:36.687 --> 29:39.125
OK. WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU HEARD ABOUT OUR
LITTLE BAKE SALE,

29:39.168 --> 29:41.605
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT
$10 MILLION LOOKS LIKE,

29:41.649 --> 29:44.347
AND IT WON'T FIT
IN THAT BRIEFCASE.

29:44.391 --> 29:45.914
IT'S 2.5. THE BALANCE
WILL BE WIRED

29:45.958 --> 29:48.134
TO WHATEVER ACCOUNT
YOU--

29:48.177 --> 29:49.831
THIS IS AN ALL-CASH
BUSINESS, MS. HAMILTON,

29:49.875 --> 29:54.270
BUT YOU WANT THE SUIT,
IT'S YOURS

29:54.314 --> 29:57.534
AS SOON AS WE PEEL IT OFF
OF HER DEAD BODY.

30:03.149 --> 30:05.151
SO I GOT GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.152
NOPE. IT'S ALL BAD,

30:06.195 --> 30:08.067
AND IT SOMEHOW
JUST GOT WORSE.

30:27.869 --> 30:28.827
SHINY, SHINY.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.485
2.5 MILLION FOR THE SUIT
OFF OF HER DEAD BODY,

30:35.529 --> 30:37.487
AND WITH THE HIGHEST BID
FOR THE PRIVILEGE

30:37.531 --> 30:40.403
OF KILLING HER,

30:40.447 --> 30:42.318
SOLD TO THE GENTLEMAN

30:42.362 --> 30:43.537
WITH THE SCORE TO SETTLE
WITH THE BAT.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.542
THE MONEY I LOST
FROM THE SHIPMENT

30:48.585 --> 30:50.152
IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO WHAT I'LL GET
FOR YOU.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.198
PEOPLE WILL PAY
A PREMIUM FOR
A PIECE OF...

30:52.241 --> 30:53.677
THE BAT.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.549
LUKE, NOW.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.121
HOLD STILL.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.174
GO CHECK IT OUT!

31:12.218 --> 31:12.783
-UNH!
-UGH.

31:25.666 --> 31:26.536
PLEASE, PLEASE.
I WON'T TELL ANYONE

31:26.580 --> 31:28.625
ABOUT YOU AND SRR.

31:28.669 --> 31:29.931
AAH!

31:29.975 --> 31:31.324
I KNOW.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.375
UNH!

31:39.419 --> 31:43.031
AGH! UGH! OOF!

31:43.075 --> 31:43.640
RAHHHH!

31:48.994 --> 31:50.865
AAH!

31:53.172 --> 31:55.000
AAH!

32:10.145 --> 32:10.450
UNH!

32:13.148 --> 32:15.324
OK. SO THAT WAS AWESOME.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.979
ALSO, MAGPIE'S HERE.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.242
-MAGPIE.
-YEAH. I DON'T KNOW,

32:20.286 --> 32:21.243
BUT SHE HAS THE JOURNAL,
AND LUKE SAYS

32:21.287 --> 32:23.767
THAT SHE'S HEADING
TO THE ROOF.

32:23.811 --> 32:23.898
I'LL GET HER.
YOU GET HER
OUT OF HERE.

32:33.821 --> 32:36.998
SERIOUSLY?

32:37.042 --> 32:38.304
EARLY BIRD GETS
THE WORM.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.090
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM ARKHAM.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.701
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T
A JAILBIRD.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.676
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
A ABOUT A BIRD IN THE HAND?

33:02.719 --> 33:05.287
YEAH, I DO.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.201
NO!

33:29.050 --> 33:34.055
OK. SO WHICH ONE
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FIRST--

33:34.099 --> 33:37.580
"THANKS FOR SAVING MY ASS"
OR "SORRY FOR ALWAYS
SHUTTING YOU OUT"?

33:37.624 --> 33:40.322
UH...YOU PICK.

33:40.366 --> 33:44.022
I'M SORRY FOR ALWAYS
KEEPING YOU AT ARM'S LENGTH,

33:44.065 --> 33:45.588
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE
I DON'T TRUST YOU

33:45.632 --> 33:48.069
OR THINK THAT YOU
CAN'T HANDLE YOURSELF,

33:48.113 --> 33:51.203
WHICH OBVIOUSLY
YOU CAN.

33:51.246 --> 33:54.945
IT'S BECAUSE I'VE
ALREADY LOST ONE SISTER,

33:54.989 --> 33:55.555
AND THE THOUGHT
OF LOSING YOU, TOO,

33:55.598 --> 34:00.386
I--I CAN'T, MARY,

34:00.429 --> 34:05.086
BUT THANK YOU FOR NOT
LISTENING TO ME

34:05.130 --> 34:08.176
AND RISKING YOUR LIFE
TO SAVE MINE.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.134
I GUESS I JUST HAVE TO
GET USED TO THE FACT

34:09.177 --> 34:13.703
THAT YOU ARE...
A TOTAL BADASS.

34:13.747 --> 34:17.446
BADASS ENOUGH

34:17.490 --> 34:19.535
TO BE ONE OF YOUR
REAL ESTATE ASSISTANTS?

34:19.579 --> 34:21.711
I BELIEVE THEY PREFER
TO BE CALLED ASSOCIATES.

34:21.755 --> 34:24.192
-OHH!
-OH, OK.

34:24.236 --> 34:27.717
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE BATCAVE.

34:27.761 --> 34:28.718
THAT IS LITERALLY
THE COOLEST THING ANYONE
HAS EVER SAID TO ME.

34:28.762 --> 34:31.591
-OK.
-OK. ALL RIGHT. BYE.

34:31.634 --> 34:35.899
WOMAN: ♪ ALWAYS, ALWAYS
BE HOME ♪

34:35.943 --> 34:39.903

UH, YOU COULD DEFINITELY
SAY THAT.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.559
AND APPARENTLY
BATWOMAN WAS HERE,

34:43.603 --> 34:46.214
WHICH IS SUPERWEIRD
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME

34:46.258 --> 34:48.738
I SAW BATWOMAN
I WAS WITH YOU.

34:48.782 --> 34:51.001
KIND OF A CRAZY
COINCIDENCE.

34:51.045 --> 34:54.222
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

34:54.266 --> 34:58.400
I WASN'T REALLY AT THE CLUB
SUSSING OUT THE COMPETITION.

34:58.444 --> 35:01.447
JOHNNY SABATINO STOLE
SOMETHING FROM
WAYNE ENTERPRISES,

35:01.490 --> 35:02.100
AND I NEEDED IT BACK.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.841
BATWOMAN HELPED ME.

35:04.885 --> 35:08.758
THINK YOU COULD, UH,
GET ME HER AUTOGRAPH?

35:08.802 --> 35:13.111
-PROBABLY NOT.
-HEH HEH.

35:13.154 --> 35:16.114
BUT I COULD GIVE YOU
A RIDE HOME.

35:16.157 --> 35:20.161
AFTER TONIGHT, I WAS
HEADING TO GET A DRINK.

35:20.205 --> 35:23.947

36:41.590 --> 36:44.637
OH, MY GOD! OH. WHERE'S...

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
NO, NO! NO!

36:51.383 --> 36:54.864
-OK.
-WHAT?

36:54.908 --> 36:59.217
THIS. ABSOLUTELY NO ONE
CAN KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE,
UNDERSTAND?

36:59.260 --> 37:00.522
YES.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.264
KATE'S LIFE DEPENDS
ON THIS, MARY.
I'M SERIOUS.

37:03.308 --> 37:04.047
YOU CAN TRUST ME
REALLY.

37:04.091 --> 37:06.920
THIS IS THE BIGGEST SECRET

37:06.963 --> 37:10.880
YOU WILL EVER KEEP
IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE, OK?

37:10.924 --> 37:13.883
OK. LOOK. WHEN BRUCE
FIRST SHOWED ME THIS PLACE--

37:13.927 --> 37:18.366
BRUCE WAYNE
IS BATMAN?

37:18.410 --> 37:21.630
-UM, THAT'S--
-OHH!

37:21.674 --> 37:23.502
OK.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.424
LUKE: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S GONE?

38:16.468 --> 38:17.382
I WOKE UP,
AND REAGAN WAS GONE,

38:17.425 --> 38:19.949
AND--AND--AND SO WAS
THE BOOK.

38:19.993 --> 38:23.039
THE BOOK FILLED
WITH SECRETS MY DAD
DIED TO PROTECT?

38:23.083 --> 38:26.216
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT
REAGAN WOULD--

38:26.260 --> 38:27.783
-I'M SORRY, LUKE.
-YEAH. SORRY DOESN'T

38:27.827 --> 38:31.309
UNDO THE FACT THAT
YOUR LIFE IS VERY MUCH
IN DANGER AGAIN,

38:31.352 --> 38:33.223
AS IN RIGHT WHERE
WE STARTED BUT WORSE!

38:33.267 --> 38:36.444
JULIA: GUYS...
WITH EVERYONE
IN GOTHAM TRYING

38:36.488 --> 38:37.706
TO GET THEIR HANDS
ON THAT JOURNAL,

38:37.750 --> 38:39.229
I THINK THE
MILLION-DOLLAR
QUESTION IS

38:39.273 --> 38:40.013
WHAT WOULD
A BLOODY BARTENDER
WANT WITH IT?

38:49.892 --> 38:52.460
HOPE YOU KNOW YOU COST
ME A REALLY HOT
GIRLFRIEND, MAGPIE...

38:52.504 --> 38:56.029
AGAIN.

38:56.072 --> 38:59.467
THAT'S WHAT YOU
GET FOR FALLING
FOR A MARK AGAIN.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.643
YOU KNOW
HOW THIS WORKS.

39:01.687 --> 39:04.733
WE STEAL FROM THE RICH
BECAUSE THEY'LL
NEVER MISS IT.

39:04.777 --> 39:07.823
YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO MISS THEM.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.738
YOU GOT YOUR BOOK.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.350
YOU CAN TRADE IT
FOR YOUR FREEDOM,
BUT I'M OUT.

39:12.393 --> 39:15.483
I'M DONE BEING
ADVANCE SCOUT FOR MAGPIE.

39:15.527 --> 39:19.574
I THOUGHT YOU'D
DO ANYTHING
FOR YOUR SISTER.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.576
I'M PRETTY SURE
I JUST DID.

39:30.716 --> 39:34.372
-HEY.
-HEY.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.243
SINCE WE MISSED DINNER,

39:36.286 --> 39:38.114
HOW ABOUT WE GRAB
A CELEBRATORY BREKKIE?

39:38.158 --> 39:40.421
WITH TOMMY ELLIOT NOT
GETTING HIS DAY IN COURT,

39:40.465 --> 39:42.684
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
THERE IS TO CELEBRATE.

39:42.728 --> 39:47.602
HMM. THINK WE CAN
THINK OF SOMETHING.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.042
OH, I GOT TO GET THIS.
UM, I'LL CATCH YOU UP?

39:53.086 --> 39:53.913
YEAH.

40:02.748 --> 40:03.879
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

40:03.923 --> 40:07.535
YEAH. YEAH.

40:07.579 --> 40:10.146
I UNDERSTAND.

40:10.190 --> 40:14.455
THERE'S BEEN
AN UNFORESEEN SETBACK.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.283
I DON'T HAVE MY HANDS
ON THE JOURNAL YET,

40:16.326 --> 40:19.808
BUT I ASSURE I WILL,

40:19.852 --> 40:20.853
AND THEN IT'LL BE YOURS.

40:24.596 --> 40:28.077
HOLD STILL.
ONE WRONG MOVE,

40:28.121 --> 40:29.427
AND MY LITTLE TRACKER FRIEND
WILL ZAP YOU,

40:29.470 --> 40:30.863
AND YOU'LL BE A DEAD DODO.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.788
THERE. NOW YOU'RE FREE
TO FLY THE COOP.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.790
OH. GOOD.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.139
I WAS NEVER MEANT
TO BE A HOMING PIGEON.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.799
HOW'S MY NEW
FAVORITE BOOK?

40:53.842 --> 40:54.800
HAVE YOU GOTTEN
TO THE CHAPTER YET

40:54.843 --> 40:57.193
THAT TELLS US HOW TO
KILL THE BAT?

40:57.237 --> 40:59.500
NO, BECAUSE IT
APPEARS TOMMY ELLIOT

40:59.544 --> 41:02.111
NEGLECTED TO SHARE
ONE VERY...

41:02.155 --> 41:04.287
CRUCIAL DETAIL.

41:04.331 --> 41:07.334
LUCIUS FOX WROTE
THE ENTIRE JOURNAL
IN CODE!

41:16.561 --> 41:17.823
ERRR!

41:45.198 --> 41:47.200
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
