<i>That is, until this year.</i>

00:26.610 --> 00:28.904
<i>It's the role Troy was groomed to play.</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:35.911
I bet the old Griffins would be better
with you on the field.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.162
You're probably pretty fast.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.205
[chuckles]

00:38.288 --> 00:40.290
I adore the old pigskin, Marty,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.709
but alas, I fell in love with crew.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.211
-[phone buzzes]
-Yeah.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.255
Excuse me.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.343
So, um...

00:51.426 --> 00:53.720
are they ready to put their name
on our new student center?

00:53.804 --> 00:55.222
I set 'em, you spike 'em.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.306
That's my boy.

Hi. Dean's here.

[Fairbanks laughing]

[woman] Good to see you.

[chattering continuing]

01:06.066 --> 01:07.401
[Troy] Dad?

01:07.484 --> 01:08.902
Something's happening on campus.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.446
Not now, son. You're being rude.

Dad.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.372
-Calm down, son.
-I can't.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.916
I got into performing arts high school,
like Wesley Snipes,

01:23.000 --> 01:24.835
Amy Winehouse, Tupac.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.545

But-- but, Dad--

-You're going to Trinity.
-Yes, sir.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.761
[Troy] So... we were thinking

01:34.845 --> 01:37.889
of taking a four-day weekend
and heading up to Toronto.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.350
See the sights.

-[laughing]

02:01.455 --> 02:02.873
You're being rude, son.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.251
How about I tell your donors about
the kind of school they're giving to?

02:06.335 --> 02:07.294
You listen to me.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.046
No, you listen to me for once.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.382
We need to get the campus police
over to Garmin House now.

02:13.425 --> 02:16.011
[shouting]

02:16.094 --> 02:18.555
Just take that shit off.

I'm pouring out your motherfuckin' liquor.
I'm pouring out your liquor.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.770
Thanks for the heads-up.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.189
Thanks for making sure
they don't arrest the black kids.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.107
Nice party.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.943
Dude, I have no idea
who these people are or why they're here.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.363
Yo, yo, Kurt, on the real,

to take you up on that haircut.

Meet me in the bathroom.

Jackie O. or Marilyn?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.273
Is this some girl riddle

03:51.356 --> 03:53.108
where the only answer is I'm an asshole?

03:53.191 --> 03:54.568
When you get elected today,

03:54.651 --> 03:56.445
am I your Jackie O.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.696
or your Marilyn?

03:58.488 --> 03:59.489
Hmm.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.701
I hate any hypothetical that ends with me
getting shot in the head.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.580
All of the above?

04:06.663 --> 04:09.624
Mm, that doesn't work for everything.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.628
So, uh...

04:13.712 --> 04:15.422
see you later or

04:15.505 --> 04:17.591
are you rationing that
so I don't get addicted?

04:17.674 --> 04:19.092
I'll text you.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.014
Brush your teeth.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.516
[door clicks shut]

04:26.600 --> 04:29.936
Now I gotta get these edges super crispy

04:30.020 --> 04:32.189
because you motherfuckers
are picky as shit.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.940
[scoffs] I'm not like that.

[Sam] I'm becoming a mainstay here.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.135
[Fairbanks] I cannot believe you made

05:02.219 --> 05:04.304
such a spectacle
of sending out that invite,

05:04.387 --> 05:05.764
and I will not sit by

05:05.847 --> 05:08.683
while you instigate a race war
on my campus.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.644
You don't accuse your doctor
of infecting you

05:10.727 --> 05:12.938
just because she diagnosed your problem.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.982
Allow me to diagnose your problem.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.109
You got a nasty case of misplaced rage.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.403
Fortunately, I've got a cure for that.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.739
[scoffs] Seeing what you did to your son,

05:22.823 --> 05:24.449
I imagine it involves brainwashing.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.909
[Fairbanks] You are on probation.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.287
One more incident like this, and you will
have to find another campus to blow up.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.040
Now, I hear that Harvard

05:32.123 --> 05:34.668
has really loosened
their admission standards.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.004
Please, see yourself out.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.175
Good meeting?

05:42.259 --> 05:44.010
Fucking fantastic.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.273
I don't know what you ever saw
in that girl.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.607
She's a hothead.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.444
Her rhetoric makes this campus
look like a powder keg

06:01.528 --> 06:04.114
of racial unrest, like a state school.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.949
Now, it's gonna be hard enough for you

06:06.032 --> 06:07.701
to convince these students

06:07.784 --> 06:10.203
to vote and elect
their first black president.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.080
Relax. We're good.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.542
The article in <i>The Independent</i>
was basically a love letter.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.294
Oh, so you want to take a day off?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.920

06:19.004 --> 06:20.839
You're Odysseus

06:20.922 --> 06:22.757
with Ithaca in plain sight.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.927
And you... want to take a nap.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.263
You remember what happened to him,
don't you?

06:28.346 --> 06:29.973
He reached Ithaca safely?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.226
I never finished the <i>Odyssey.</i>

06:33.893 --> 06:35.687
He fell asleep.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.481
And his men cut open
his prized possessions,

06:38.565 --> 06:40.358
unleashing the adverse winds

06:40.442 --> 06:42.902
that sent him back across the ocean,

06:42.986 --> 06:45.572
adding years to his journey.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.032
Spoiler alert.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.283
Look, nigga,

06:49.284 --> 06:51.369
you're gonna hit these ivy-lined streets,

06:51.453 --> 06:53.079
and you're gonna leave neither

06:53.163 --> 06:56.166

06:56.249 --> 06:57.417
Yes, sir.

One sec!

07:15.852 --> 07:19.689
Hey. Uh, I was thinking...

07:19.773 --> 07:21.358
[coughs]

07:21.441 --> 07:23.777
I could hit the campaign trail
with you.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.819
Sure.

07:24.903 --> 07:25.820
What, the, uh, paper

07:25.904 --> 07:26.988
wants to see how I campaign?

07:27.072 --> 07:29.491
Uh... yes.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.369
This is totally an assignment
for the paper.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.788
Cool, all right.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.247
[door clicks shut]

07:42.629 --> 07:45.006
[Troy] Yo, my computer science majors,

07:45.090 --> 07:47.217
when are you guys gonna invite me to D&D?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.302
I got a wizard ready
to whoop Zargon's ass.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.638
[laughs] We don't have time
to quest right now, Troy.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.182
We've been trying
to perfect this VR interface,

07:54.265 --> 07:57.519
which is impossible
on Winchester's Paleolithic network.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.063
Hmm. Number one on my agenda:

08:00.146 --> 08:02.607
bring fiber optic Internet to Winchester.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.150
How are you supposed
to make the next Facebook

08:04.234 --> 08:05.360
on MySpace speeds?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.278
-[chuckles]
-Vote Fairbanks.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.322
Winchester is not just a school to me.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.574
I practically grew up here.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.661
And that party wasn't just painful.
It was embarrassing.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.706
We didn't land on Winchester.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.834
Winchester landed on us.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.045
I got caught up.

08:24.129 --> 08:30.051
We need to work together
to make our voices stronger!

08:30.135 --> 08:31.720
[speaking Spanish]

08:31.803 --> 08:34.139
Too bad we can't vote.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.975
With me as your lifeline,

08:37.058 --> 08:40.311
we will have unprecedented access
to the administration.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.646
So we should vote for you

08:41.730 --> 08:44.858
because your father's the HNIC?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.860
No, because of all the other candidates,

08:46.943 --> 08:49.070
who do you think is gonna have your back?

08:49.154 --> 08:50.864
Especially after that shit you pulled.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.033
[Troy] Sam, help a brother out.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.410
What's it gonna take to get your support?

08:57.746 --> 09:00.290
You could put a political foot
in <i>Pastiche's</i> ass

09:00.373 --> 09:03.376
for this blatant racism they call satire.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.588
[Troy] As students of color at Winchester,

09:06.671 --> 09:07.964
we're like this dumpling:

09:08.048 --> 09:09.841
a mix of exciting flavors

09:09.924 --> 09:12.969
surrounded by bland, white dough.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.637
But...

09:14.721 --> 09:16.514
when brought together with love,

09:16.598 --> 09:18.308
it can be...

09:18.391 --> 09:20.226
beautiful.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.352
Damn.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.604
This brother can do anything.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.189
[chuckles]

09:27.025 --> 09:28.651
Oh, <i>Pastiche...</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:30.820
is going to pay.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.364
[chattering]

09:33.448 --> 09:36.618
Am I the only one who sees
that this emperor is bare-ass naked?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.286
Look, I know we don't agree
on a lot of things--

09:38.369 --> 09:39.287
Most things.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.081
Like, all the things.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.582
Then vote for Aidan,

09:42.665 --> 09:45.126
Colin or Muffy

09:45.210 --> 09:46.878
if you can tell 'em apart.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.672
[laughing]

09:49.756 --> 09:51.174
[Troy] Hey, ladies, having fun?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.467
Hardly.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.844
This display of toxic masculinity

09:54.928 --> 09:58.056
and peacocking perpetuates a rape culture
on campus.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.017
Couldn't agree with you more, my sister.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.685
Number one on my agenda:

10:02.769 --> 10:06.064
open social clubs to all genders.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.191
Tro-bama! My man.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.693
When you win,
can I be your Secret Service?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.612
Those dudes get all the pussy.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.365
[inhales] Getting you all the pussy?

10:15.448 --> 10:16.741
Number one on my agenda.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.660
Vote Fairbanks.

10:32.715 --> 10:36.010
[cheering]

10:36.094 --> 10:38.263
-[grunting]
-[whistle blows]

10:38.346 --> 10:39.514
Whoo!

10:39.597 --> 10:42.100
Don't forget. Vote Fairbanks.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.476
[cheers and applause]

10:43.560 --> 10:45.019
[Lionel] Last question.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.397
Why is it important
that people vote for you?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.523
It isn't.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.277
It's important to vote, period.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.321
Whether on a collegiate, local
or national level,

10:55.405 --> 10:57.615
what makes this country great

10:57.699 --> 11:00.243
is that we have the power
to choose our leaders.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.203
[camera shutters clicking]

11:02.287 --> 11:03.705
And the broken vending machine in Bechet

11:03.788 --> 11:05.790
that gives two-for-one sodas?

11:05.874 --> 11:07.417
That also makes this country great.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.377
[laughing]

11:09.460 --> 11:13.214
[camera shutters clicking]

11:28.980 --> 11:30.148
[beeps]

11:34.777 --> 11:37.238
My dad says if I lose,
he's moving to Canada.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.656
[laughs]

11:38.740 --> 11:40.491
Fingers crossed
that I can remain stateside.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.869
-[woman] Yeah.
-[laughing]

11:42.952 --> 11:44.454
If you'll excuse us a moment.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.417
Son, I'd like you
to say hello to Neika Hobbs,

11:49.500 --> 11:51.127
African-American Studies professor.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.879
And student faculty liaison.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.714
I guess we'll be working closely together.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.466
Well, I apologize in advance.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.842
You're a better person than I.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.969
In politics, you can't tell people
to go fuck themselves.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.638
If I don't do that once a week,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.681
I get a migraine.

12:03.765 --> 12:04.891
-[laughing]
-Ah, Monique.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.768
How lovely to see you.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.603
Hey, when are you two tying the knot?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.396
Good question.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.065
Well, why don't we just enjoy our love

12:12.148 --> 12:15.443
pure and untouched
by the heteronormative culture,

12:15.526 --> 12:16.903
the way God intended?

12:18.404 --> 12:20.406
But when I have an answer
to your question,

12:20.490 --> 12:21.824
you'll be the first to know.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.201
Ah.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.994
-[laughing]
-Okay.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.329
Ah, Nancy!

12:26.412 --> 12:27.330
Come on.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.626
Well, I guess I'll see you around,
Mr. President.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.255
Students should leave Winchester
with more than

12:35.338 --> 12:37.048
just a degree and a beer belly.

12:37.131 --> 12:42.053
If you were a cat owner
and only all cats were dying in America,

12:42.136 --> 12:45.348
if someone said to you, "All pets matter,"

12:45.431 --> 12:46.808
you'd be upset, too.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.352
Beyoncé would make a fantastic candidate

12:49.435 --> 12:50.937
for an honorary degree.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.231
[chattering]

12:55.900 --> 12:58.236
[chuckles] Troy.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.446
You remember Thane.
Best running back in the Ivies.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.864
Tro-bama.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.575
Ha, very clever, very clever.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.203
Now, listen, we still have the support
of the Griffins, yes?

13:07.829 --> 13:09.163
Hell yeah, bro.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.957
Glad someone's having a good time.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.417
[Fairbanks] You're not them.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.795
-Ah, Stacy!
-Walter!

13:17.171 --> 13:19.507
This party's a fucking snooze-fest.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.635
I mean, there's some quality MILFs
up in here,

13:22.719 --> 13:24.887
but I need about...

13:24.971 --> 13:26.597
six more whiskeys

13:26.681 --> 13:28.850
before I taste the early bird special,

13:28.933 --> 13:30.101
if you know what I mean.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.020
Oh, Lionel.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.396
Have you met Thane Lockwood?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.689
I'm on my way out.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.275
No, you should interview him
about how the team is doing this year.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.027
I don't really cover sports.

13:39.110 --> 13:42.405
Well,
it's time to expand your horizons.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.450
-[sighs]
-Sometimes I get tired of football...

13:45.533 --> 13:47.827
-Sprite, please.
-[phone dings]

13:53.708 --> 13:55.376
It's the mighty Fairbanks.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.545
-Ha-ha.
-[chuckles]

13:57.628 --> 14:00.798
I just want to say
you're doing a great job.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.468
Well, I learn by watching you,
President Fletcher.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.927
Oh, see?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.637
That's what I always liked about you.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.515
You're even smoother than your father.

14:09.599 --> 14:13.478
It feels like yesterday you were just
a toddler taking your first steps

14:13.561 --> 14:14.729
in your father's office.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.648
-Look at you now.
-Walking like a champ.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.152
Next semester? Jogging.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.237
[both laughing]

14:23.321 --> 14:25.573
Uh, two champagnes, please.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.706
Troy, when you are elected president--

14:33.790 --> 14:34.624
If.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.584
When.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.754
I hope you'll look out for my boy

14:39.837 --> 14:41.297
any way you can.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.924
God knows...

14:43.007 --> 14:46.511
Kurt really needs it
after that disgraceful party.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.472
Number one on my agenda.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.683
-[glasses clink]
-To you.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.560
Now,

14:54.644 --> 14:56.270
you'll have to excuse me.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.191
I think Diane and Richard
are just drunk enough

15:00.274 --> 15:02.235
to buy us a new track.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.195
Diane!

15:04.821 --> 15:07.865
Oh, you look stunning.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.242
I'll take that, thank you.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.952
It's just one glass of champagne.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.205
And you're one year away
from legally being able to drink it.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.708
I'm all talked out, Dad.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.503
Probably should just head home
and shut it down.

15:21.087 --> 15:21.921
Okay.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.589
Good night, son.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.053
[muffled rap music playing]

15:38.729 --> 15:39.981
[phone dings]

15:46.904 --> 15:48.739
Just the man I wanted to see.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.242
Well, I can't say the same.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.994
I need your help.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.539
People think I threw that racist party,
but I didn't send out those invitations.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.209
Let me guess, the only reason you didn't
is because your dad found out?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.879
No, I realize we live in a delicate time
rife with racial tensions.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.840
And my dad found out.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.592
Yeah, if you're so innocent,

16:07.675 --> 16:09.844
<i>then why was I the one</i>
<i>that called the cops and not you?</i>

16:09.927 --> 16:11.471
[Kurt] <i>'Cause Sam invited people over.</i>

16:11.554 --> 16:12.763
<i>They showed up at my house,</i>

16:12.847 --> 16:14.182
and, you know, purple drink

16:14.265 --> 16:15.933
ain't gonna serve itself,
know what I mean?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.643
-Wow.
-I'm kidding.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.353
I'm kid-- look, Troy.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.648
If you get elected,
you need to give me a pardon.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.942
-Not a governor.
-A social pardon.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.528
I've been bailing you out
since grade school.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.865
Remember that time you put the boot
on the kid's wheelchair tire?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.701
Just because his legs didn't work
doesn't mean he wasn't an asshole.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.953
You know, the BSU is pissed at you.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.414
And they're not wrong.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.000
What the fuck was that lawn jockey shit
on your cover?

16:42.210 --> 16:45.796
It's a commentary on how people don't even
know why they're angry anymore.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.507
The lawn jockey used to signal to slaves

16:47.590 --> 16:49.926
on the Underground Railroad
if a house was safe.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.012
Where did you get that from?

16:53.095 --> 16:54.514
Wikipedia, man.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.349
[scoffs]

16:56.432 --> 16:58.601
You are tiptoeing
towards "piece of shit," man.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.604
Oh, so Sam's the only one
who's allowed to be provocative?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.147
-[phone dings]
-[Kurt] If you threw

17:03.231 --> 17:04.732
a white-face party, I'd defend you.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.400
[Troy] That's not a thing!

17:06.484 --> 17:07.777
Not yet!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.070
Hey!

17:09.153 --> 17:11.072
Who wants to see me fly?

17:11.155 --> 17:13.324
-[all cheering]
-Whoo!

17:16.410 --> 17:17.954
[Neika] I can't believe your father

17:18.037 --> 17:19.956
introduces us every time.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.795
Eye of the tiger,

17:25.878 --> 17:27.171
memory of the goldfish.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.882
[both chuckle]

17:29.966 --> 17:30.883
How long has it been?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.552
Two years?

17:32.635 --> 17:34.595
Well, tomorrow's our anniversary.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.722
I'm just kidding.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.975
[breathes deeply]

17:40.434 --> 17:42.186
You look tense.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.938
And you look beautiful.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.608
And you look like you have on
too many clothes.

17:47.692 --> 17:48.859
Mmm. [kisses]

17:56.284 --> 17:57.201
Ooh.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.453
I remember those games.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.707
Someone marking their territory. [kisses]

18:02.790 --> 18:04.292
Yeah?

18:04.375 --> 18:05.543
How's Monique?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.253
[laughs]

18:08.629 --> 18:10.089
That's funny, Troy.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.176
So...

18:16.470 --> 18:17.597
so who'd you vote for?

18:18.806 --> 18:20.308
[exhales sharply]

18:20.391 --> 18:21.559
The white one.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.315
Troy, your father has a life of his own.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.400
Why are you living yours for him?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.319
He pays my room and board?

18:37.491 --> 18:42.997
Today at Armstrong-Parker, I told everyone
how bad I wanted to fight for them.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.083
And you know what?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.084
What?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.962
Think I meant it.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.548
Then why did you vote for someone else?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.884
You don't think you deserve
to wear that crown?

18:56.719 --> 18:58.137
Look at me.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.392
Let me let you in on a little secret.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.478
No one does.

19:26.916 --> 19:27.833
[phone dings]

19:35.216 --> 19:37.051
[exhales]

19:37.134 --> 19:38.302
Troy.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.512
It's 6:30.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.098
And congratulations, you won.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.432
Come on, we gotta go.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.517
Let's go before the team gets here.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.518
Yeah.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.978
[chattering]

19:48.062 --> 19:49.855
-Oh.
-We're fucked.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.274
We're gonna figure this shit out.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.235
Professor Hobbs, Troy,
thank God you're here.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.820
We wanted to get here
before the team.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.655
Yeah, he was showing me the boats.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.448
-She's a lesbian.
-I love boats.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.574
Who cares?

20:00.658 --> 20:02.368
Thane Lockwood died last night.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.663
[Troy] Oh, God.

20:06.414 --> 20:09.542
So that's why everyone is here.
That's why we're here.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.837
This is so tragic and so sad.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.838
So sad.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.339
He tried to fly...

20:15.423 --> 20:17.174
and... he couldn't.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.884
So, so sad.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.512
-Mm, my heart.
-Did you call anyone?
