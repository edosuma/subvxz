00:02.360 --> 00:05.740
Oh man, that was intense.

00:07.180 --> 00:09.540
I need some fluids.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.160
I must been down a quart.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.780
Just make you up a quart, huh?

00:22.230 --> 00:25.010
Hey, you know what would be good
right now?

00:25.410 --> 00:29.920
Pudding cup. I get some in the fridge.
You want one?

00:32.490 --> 00:35.830
You have bad experience with pudding?

00:36.460 --> 00:38.650
What are we doing, Charlie?

00:38.900 --> 00:44.100
Well, you are crying and my best guess
is I'm about to apologize for sth.

00:44.110 --> 00:47.000
Everytime I come over, 
it's a same routine.

00:47.010 --> 00:52.490
We have Chinese take out then we have sex,
then we roll over and go to sleep.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.640
Which is why I suggested the pudding.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.990
You know, makes up a little.

01:00.370 --> 01:05.990
Besides, what about all the wonderful
talking and joking, you know, sharing we do?

01:06.250 --> 01:10.070
Sharing? What'd we share, Charile?

01:10.080 --> 01:13.910
Well, we share Chinese takeout.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.040
And... the other night we watched
the Laker game toghther.

01:18.050 --> 01:21.890
You watched it over my shoulder
while we were having sex.

01:21.900 --> 01:25.150
Come on, it was overtime.

01:25.510 --> 01:27.980
What kind of relationship is this?

01:27.990 --> 01:30.810
We don't go anywhere,
we don't do anything.

01:30.820 --> 01:34.870
Where do you want to go? What do you 
want to do? I can get Laker tickets.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.700
I don't want to go to a basketball game.

01:37.950 --> 01:42.290
I want to know who your are.
I want you to know who I am.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.170
I know who you are.

01:44.180 --> 01:47.650
You do? Ok, what's my middle name?

01:47.660 --> 01:52.390
Your middle name? Okay, I know this.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.480
Sunburn boobs...

01:55.490 --> 01:57.920
- What?
- Hang on.

01:58.250 --> 02:03.110
Sunburn boobs, red boobs, 
red breast... Robin.

02:04.670 --> 02:06.400
Good memory trick.

02:06.410 --> 02:09.210
My middle name is Christine.

02:09.449 --> 02:11.420
Not a very good trick.

02:11.950 --> 02:16.700
Who's my best friend? Where do I work?
What's my cat's name?

02:16.710 --> 02:21.420
What's my favorite movie? What kind of 
music do I like? What religion was I raised?

02:21.430 --> 02:25.010
And do I have any brothers and sisters?

02:25.520 --> 02:28.330
Ok,I'd like to start with the cat.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.520
I'm gonna go with Fluffy.

02:33.530 --> 02:36.360
Drop dead.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.380
Snow ball? Mr. Mittens? Tiger?
Whiskers? Puss-puss?

02:42.930 --> 02:45.440
Oh, come on. What's my middle name?

02:45.450 --> 02:46.680
Francis.

02:46.690 --> 02:47.950
No, it's not.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.120
Yes, it is.

02:50.130 --> 02:52.000
Show off.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.290
Oh, Chelsea, come on.

03:03.310 --> 03:06.690
How much do I need to know about
you other than I'm crazy about you?

03:06.710 --> 03:09.710
It's not that you don't know.
It's that you don't care.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.160
I do care. I just don't
pay close attention.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.520
Good-bye, Charlie.

03:14.550 --> 03:20.160
I mean, I pay attention,
but I don't test well. Damn.

03:25.420 --> 03:28.540
What did you do, bring out
the handcuffs too early?

03:30.200 --> 03:32.760
Apparently, I don't
know her middle name.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.370
It's Christine.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.950
- How do you know?
- She told me.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.870
- Why did she tell you?
- I asked her.

03:37.880 --> 03:38.880
Why did you ask?

03:38.910 --> 03:40.990
How else do you get to know a person?

03:41.020 --> 03:43.210
Go away.

03:43.220 --> 03:46.560
If a woman stormed out on me
after sex, would you go away?

03:46.590 --> 03:48.690
That's beside the point.

03:49.740 --> 03:51.420
So, what happened?

03:51.450 --> 03:53.160
I don't know.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.550
We were having a nice night.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.040
Little lo mein, little sex.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.330
Then the crying started.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.430
Oh, yeah. Been there, done that.

04:01.020 --> 04:03.700
No, she was crying.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.630
She wants more out of our relationship.

04:08.660 --> 04:09.830
More what?

04:09.840 --> 04:13.240
I'm not sure. I know it's not pudding.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.950
Well, what did she say?

04:16.970 --> 04:19.529
She said I don't know her well enough.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.420
You tell me: what's
more important to know?

04:21.450 --> 04:25.140
Her cat's me or which of her
body parts you can't sneak up on?

04:25.580 --> 04:28.160
Well, I'm not sure one
necessarily precludes the other.

04:28.430 --> 04:32.770
Yeah, well, I've never been mule-kicked
for not knowing a cat's name.

04:34.210 --> 04:35.660
It doesn't matter.

04:35.690 --> 04:37.850
There's more where she came from.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.470
Speaking of which...

04:40.500 --> 04:43.530
where does she come from?

04:43.540 --> 04:45.560
I don't know, and I don't care.

04:45.590 --> 04:47.460
Davenport, Iowa.

04:47.470 --> 04:49.750
Bite me.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.660
Want to know her cat's name?

04:51.670 --> 04:52.810
No.

04:52.820 --> 04:55.250
It's Mandu.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.580
Mandu?

04:57.610 --> 05:00.240
Yeah, you know, Cat Mandu.

05:01.350 --> 05:03.230
It's cute, huh?

05:03.260 --> 05:05.590
Why was I thinking Puss-Puss?

05:05.600 --> 05:08.660
Because that's what
you're always thinking.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.730
What happened to all the pudding cups?

05:15.740 --> 05:17.080
I guess your uncle ate them.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.240
All of them? There were two 12-packs.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.390
Have something else.

05:24.850 --> 05:27.780
No cookies? What the hell
is going on around here?

05:27.790 --> 05:28.980
Hey, watch your mouth.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.440
I am watching it. It's
empty. I need dessert.

05:34.410 --> 05:36.830
- Son of a bitch.
- Jake!

05:38.440 --> 05:41.170
Frozen peas? What am I
gonna do with frozen peas?

05:41.180 --> 05:43.650
Well, if you want
dessert, have an apple.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.230
Not funny, Dad.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.110
You sure I can't interest
you in a pudding cup?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.430
Thanks. I'm okay.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.060
How about a chocolate chunk cookie?

05:56.070 --> 05:58.670
No, thank you.

05:59.050 --> 06:00.590
Did you quit drinking?

06:00.620 --> 06:02.910
God, no. Why?

06:02.920 --> 06:07.070
You seem to be experimenting with
a new sugar delivery system.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.410
Anything bothering you lately?

06:12.410 --> 06:17.820
Well, there is this one thing, but I don't
know if it's medical or psychological.

06:17.850 --> 06:20.010
Tell me.

06:20.020 --> 06:24.740
Lately, I've passed up a couple of
opportunities to get some strange.

06:25.740 --> 06:27.680
Strange?

06:29.420 --> 06:33.010
women with whom I have not
previously been acquainted.

06:33.020 --> 06:36.370
Oh, right, strange. Charming.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.880
Go on.

06:38.910 --> 06:41.370
Anyway, I was wondering if
there's something wrong with me.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.730
Because you passed up
meaningless sex with strangers?

06:44.790 --> 06:48.120
Exactly. That's not like me.

06:48.830 --> 06:53.400
Hey, you know, I bet "strange"
comes from "stranger."

06:53.410 --> 06:56.570
I wouldn't be surprised.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.410
So, what else is going
on with your life?

06:59.430 --> 07:01.130
Not much.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.730
I've been gaining a little
weight for some reason.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.150
Maybe 'cause I haven't
been sleeping well.

07:07.180 --> 07:09.600
Yeah, that's probably it.

07:12.560 --> 07:16.760
Oh, and this one girl I've been seeing
pretty regularly decided to dump me.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.160
Huh, what?

07:20.190 --> 07:21.780
Oh, nothing, it's just...

07:21.820 --> 07:24.890
sometimes I feel like
I'm stealing your money.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.690
So, tell me about this woman.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.690
Chelsea? Not much to tell.

07:30.700 --> 07:35.250
She's beautiful, sexy,
smart, independent.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.890
Sometimes when she laughs, she
makes a little snorting noise.

07:38.910 --> 07:41.560
It's really cute. Kind of like...

07:45.270 --> 07:48.080
Not as cute when I do it.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.760
Sounds like quite a catch.

07:49.790 --> 07:52.190
- She's okay.
- Why did she dump you?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.770
Who can understand a woman's mind?

07:55.850 --> 07:59.350
Yeah, we're pretty litt puzzles, ain't we?

07:59.360 --> 08:02.450
So, it's not just me.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.290
yway, for some reason, she suddenly
became dissatisfied with our relationship.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.380
Well, describe the relationship.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.880
It was great. She'd come over
couple times a week.

08:13.890 --> 08:17.360
Either she'd bring food or I'd
have something deliver. We'd have sex,

08:17.400 --> 08:21.700
then eat Then, maybe have sex
again, depending on what was on TV.

08:21.710 --> 08:25.180
And she became dissatisfied with that?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.490
I know, right?

08:29.940 --> 08:31.920
Butterscotch.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.940
So, how did you feel about losing her?

08:34.960 --> 08:36.880
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

08:36.890 --> 08:41.130
Come on, Charlie. Dr.Seuss
could diagnose this.

08:41.140 --> 08:45.520
You're stuffing yourself with crap
to suppress your negative feelings.

08:45.530 --> 08:48.740
No, I'm pretty sure that's why I drink.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.310
You have a choice here.

08:50.340 --> 08:55.150
You can dig down and confront your feelings
so they won't be controlling your behavior,

08:55.190 --> 09:00.880
or you can keep eating pudding and cookies until
you have more chins than a Chinese phone book.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.290
No, what else you got?

09:05.310 --> 09:07.090
Do you have a better idea?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.050
What if I could get Chelsea back?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.830
That would only be a temporary solution.

09:11.840 --> 09:12.950
So?

09:12.980 --> 09:16.630
That's what people said about bourbon, and
we've been together for almost 30 years.

09:16.960 --> 09:21.740
Okay, you're right. Go get Chelsea back,
and all your problems will be solved.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.760
I'm sensing sarcasm.

09:23.790 --> 09:26.850
Oh, good, we're finally making progress.

09:32.580 --> 09:34.830
Here you go.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.460
What are you drinking?

09:36.520 --> 09:40.620
Chocolate caramel frappuccino
with whipped cream and sprinkles.

09:42.090 --> 09:45.430
My nephew turned me on
to it. You want some?

09:45.440 --> 09:48.880
No, thanks, I had a hot
fudge sundae for breakfast.

09:48.890 --> 09:51.270
Ooh, that sounds good.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.170
You look nice.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.680
I've got to get back to work,
Charlie. What do you want?

10:04.070 --> 10:06.420
I just wanted to see
you. See how you're doing.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.560
- I'm fine.
- Good.

10:08.570 --> 10:12.660
And how's your family
back in... Davenport, Iowa?

10:12.670 --> 10:15.670
I'm from Champaign, Illinois.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.870
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

10:20.270 --> 10:22.550
Bastard set me up.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.280
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.820
I miss you.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.910
I miss you, too, but it doesn't matter.

10:30.940 --> 10:34.790
Our relationship wasn't going anywhere,
and you are incapable of change.

10:34.830 --> 10:38.380
It's not that I'm incapable.
I've just been unwilling.

10:38.390 --> 10:40.230
Thanks for clearing that up.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.140
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

10:42.170 --> 10:44.480
- I've been seeing a shrink.
- Really?

10:44.490 --> 10:48.080
Yeah, and I'm making a lot of progress
confronting my-- what do you call them?

10:48.090 --> 10:50.640
personal issues.

10:50.670 --> 10:52.100
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.720
Come. Sit.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.520
And check this out:
the shrink's a woman.

11:00.540 --> 11:03.410
A real ballbuster. I can't
get away with anything.

11:03.420 --> 11:04.810
Ballbuster?

11:04.840 --> 11:06.320
In a good way.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.850
You know, a buster of emotional balls.

11:11.130 --> 11:13.790
You should meet her.

11:13.810 --> 11:16.480
Are you suggesting we
go to couples counseling?

11:22.900 --> 11:25.180
Sure.

11:25.190 --> 11:30.800
I mean, I want to work on our relationship,
and what better way than couples counseling?

11:31.110 --> 11:32.220
You're serious.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.970
Well, of course I'm serious.

11:34.010 --> 11:36.220
What, you think I'd blurt out something
like that in the spur of the moment

11:36.230 --> 11:39.260
in a desperate attempt
to keep you from leaving?

11:39.810 --> 11:41.500
It occurred to me.

11:41.540 --> 11:44.070
Well, clearly, you don't
know me as well as you should.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.510
All right. Couples counseling.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.760
Wow, I'm impressed, Charlie.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.690
Me, too.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.910
Okay, I got to run.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.420
Let me know when our appointment is.

11:55.450 --> 11:58.030
Sure thing. Bye-bye.

12:00.730 --> 12:03.430
Oh, God, what have I done?

12:10.830 --> 12:13.450
Davenport,Iowa?

12:14.970 --> 12:21.280
Uh,did I say Davenport,Iowa?
I meant Champaign,Illinois.

12:22.140 --> 12:25.060
Okay. That's one for you.

12:25.070 --> 12:26.950
Thank you.

12:30.710 --> 12:33.320
And that's one for me.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.250
Now, I need some advice.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.910
Oh, and just a friendly heads-up.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.800
You screw with me again, it's
gonna cost you some teeth.

12:40.810 --> 12:42.230
I'm listening.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.800
Wait a minute. What's this about?

12:46.490 --> 12:50.120
Oh, he bought some stuff with his own
money, and he doesn't want you eating it.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.070
You've been to couples
counseling, right?

12:58.100 --> 12:59.390
Yeah, why?

12:59.440 --> 13:03.300
I'm going with Chelsea, and I
need to know what I'm getting into.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.670
Oh, you're gonna love it.

13:06.040 --> 13:06.800
I am?

13:06.830 --> 13:08.660
Absolutely.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.420
Once a week, you sit on a couch
with your significant other

13:12.430 --> 13:15.150
while she snips off your testicles,

13:15.170 --> 13:19.300
reaches up inside your chest
cavity and goes like this...

13:20.840 --> 13:23.700
to your heart.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.480
That doesn't sound very good.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.680
Oh, it's horrible.

13:28.710 --> 13:32.620
But it's worth it because
you're paying a stranger to watch

13:32.630 --> 13:35.590
while your life goes down the toilet.

13:36.670 --> 13:42.930
Along with your money and your house and your
car and every last shred of your self-respect!

13:47.450 --> 13:50.610
You know, maybe you're
not the right guy to ask.

13:50.620 --> 13:53.430
Oh, no. No, no, no, I'm
the perfect guy to ask.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.600
When Judith and I started, we were
just a couple with a few problems.

13:57.630 --> 14:01.130
When we finished, I came
to live on your couch!

14:03.160 --> 14:06.550
God bless couples counseling!

14:12.590 --> 14:15.370
That better not be
one of my pudding cups.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.990
Nope.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.640
Hi, Charlie. Come on in.

14:38.650 --> 14:40.600
Shouldn't we wait for Chelsea?

14:40.650 --> 14:42.450
She's already here.

14:42.460 --> 14:46.100
Really? That seems a little ambushy.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.690
Hi, sweetie.

14:48.710 --> 14:49.700
You're late.

14:49.730 --> 14:52.450
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

14:52.460 --> 14:56.160
But... I have a good excuse.

14:56.990 --> 14:59.910
Happy first day of counseling.

14:59.930 --> 15:01.330
You brought a present?

15:01.360 --> 15:04.780
- Yeah. Isn't that the protocol?
- No.

15:05.550 --> 15:07.420
So...

15:07.460 --> 15:10.580
you don't want this bottle of champagne?

15:11.440 --> 15:14.180
Bastard got me again.

15:14.190 --> 15:15.970
Well, why don't we get started.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.070
Hold on. Hold on.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.390
Does the name "Mandu"
ring any kind of a bell?

15:21.960 --> 15:23.600
What?

15:23.640 --> 15:26.050
I'm gonna kill him.

15:26.060 --> 15:30.830
Well, why don't we start out with
why we're here and what our goals are.

15:30.860 --> 15:32.800
Chelsea, would you like to go first?

15:32.810 --> 15:34.630
Sure.

15:34.650 --> 15:38.930
I want to know if my relationship
with Charlie can be more than...

15:38.970 --> 15:41.850
sex, TV, and Chinese food.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.970
It can. Right, Doc?

15:43.980 --> 15:46.560
- Of course it can.
- Thank you.

15:46.860 --> 15:49.840
Well, this is good. This is progress.

15:49.850 --> 15:52.440
I have to say this has
been a very good session.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.860
Where do you think you're going?

15:54.880 --> 15:56.870
Nowhere.

15:57.530 --> 16:00.970
Just... stretching my legs.

16:02.870 --> 16:08.030
Charlie, before you got here, Chelsea mentioned
that she feels you've fallen into a rut.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.200
A rut? We're not in a rut.

16:10.210 --> 16:12.850
When's the last time
we did something new?

16:13.720 --> 16:16.000
Hello.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.360
Great... and what else?

16:24.420 --> 16:26.250
He's got nothing.

16:26.280 --> 16:30.130
Excuse me,but if this is gonna work, you
can't jump all over me while I'm thinking.

16:30.170 --> 16:31.980
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.450
Thank you.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.750
I got nothing.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.580
Okay,might I make a suggestion?

16:42.590 --> 16:48.260
Would you be willing to commit to Chelsea
that maybe once a week, twice a month,

16:48.270 --> 16:51.840
you do something together
completely outside your comfort zone?

16:51.850 --> 16:54.040
Done. No problem.

16:54.050 --> 16:58.720
So,we could go to the ballet,
the opera, visit my parents,

16:58.770 --> 17:00.650
hang out with my brother,
go hiking with my friends?

17:02.310 --> 17:06.319
I was thinking more like renting
a chick flick and ordering Italian.

17:07.190 --> 17:08.150
This is hopeless.

17:08.180 --> 17:12.630
No,no,no,no, there's hope. There's
always hope. Keep hope alive.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.210
I can do those things.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.030
Come. Sit.

17:27.520 --> 17:33.100
Charlie,has it ever occurred to you that you might
enjoy doing new things and meeting new people?

17:34.140 --> 17:38.180
I know I'm supposed to say yes,but...

17:39.080 --> 17:43.600
every fiber of my
body is screaming,"No!"

17:46.180 --> 17:48.230
All right,then I have to ask.

17:48.270 --> 17:51.550
Given that you and Chelsea
are such different people,

17:51.560 --> 17:55.060
why do you want to be
in this relationship?

17:55.450 --> 17:59.520
Well... 'Cause I'm crazy about her.

17:59.530 --> 18:02.130
'Cause,when I'm with somebody
else, I'm thinking of her.

18:02.140 --> 18:05.040
Not that I've been with
anybody else. Tell her,Doc.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.730
He passed up strange.

18:07.740 --> 18:13.160
See,that's got to mean something, considering
how I used to, you know,live for strange.

18:13.710 --> 18:17.190
First time in the sack,
she was the strange.

18:17.210 --> 18:19.550
Charlie,can I give you my
opinion as your therapist?

18:19.580 --> 18:22.040
- Sure.
- Shut up.

18:22.890 --> 18:25.370
Oh,God,I wish I could.

18:25.930 --> 18:29.850
Chelsea,look. I know I'm not perfect.

18:32.430 --> 18:35.150
I'm sorry. That was
probably unprofessional.

18:36.440 --> 18:41.330
Anyway, you need to know that
you mean everything to me,

18:41.360 --> 18:44.540
and I'll do whatever it
takes to make this work.

18:44.570 --> 18:45.740
You really mean that?

18:45.760 --> 18:47.500
I do.

18:47.530 --> 18:50.160
Thank you,Charlie.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.320
Well,this has been very helpful.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.900
- Sit down,Charlie.
- Sit down,Charlie.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.420
We're not done?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.860
Not even close.

19:01.070 --> 19:04.790
Oh,boy. What else could we
possibly have to talk about?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.950
Well,there's always your mother and
the fact that your relationship issues

19:07.980 --> 19:12.890
are linked to your anger towards her, as
well as fear of your latent homosexuality.

19:14.930 --> 19:17.990
It was kind of a rhetorical question.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.520
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.930
How was couples counseling?

19:37.880 --> 19:40.750
You really want to know?

19:47.200 --> 19:50.440
Sure. Tell me everything.

19:56.450 --> 19:59.360
Why? Why would you do that?

19:59.370 --> 20:02.300
You know,I've been asking
myself the same thing,

20:02.350 --> 20:06.730
and the only thing I can come up
with is: it's really,really funny.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.850
Go ahead. Yuk it up.

20:11.150 --> 20:14.950
Those were among the worst
50 minutes of my entire life.

20:14.990 --> 20:17.040
I told you. Didn't I tell you?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.280
Yep. You told me.

20:19.290 --> 20:22.890
I bet you left with your
gonads in a guppy bag.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.420
I didn't get a bag.

20:24.450 --> 20:26.500
Going back next week?

20:26.510 --> 20:28.050
$180 an hour?

20:30.070 --> 20:32.600
Licensed.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.900
You two kids will patch
things up in no time.

20:35.920 --> 20:40.020
Hey,just because counseling didn't help your
relationships doesn't mean it won't help mine.

20:40.060 --> 20:44.110
Right,right. Keep
drinking that old Kool-Aid.

20:44.490 --> 20:46.980
Looking for something?

20:51.130 --> 20:54.220
Don't screw with me,kid.

20:54.230 --> 20:57.320
Now,hand over the pudding
or you'll be sorry.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.030
Have an apple.

21:04.590 --> 21:07.140
Little turd called my bluff.
