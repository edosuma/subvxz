WEBVTT

01:06.600 --> 01:08.477
Yeah, that was a gun.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.607
Pointed at you, by me.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.315
We don't know each other.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.617
I seen your flag.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.907
I see your clothes. I know what you are.

01:21.870 --> 01:24.703
I know we got
a particular person in common.

01:27.790 --> 01:29.166
Yeah, you could go for that gun.

01:31.750 --> 01:32.910
Listen.

01:35.090 --> 01:36.921
That's me holstering my weapon.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.756
But you got to know,
I'm quicker than you on my worst day.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.511
So you could go for that gun.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.181
I'll even let you turn around.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.010
I don't want to shoot a man in the back.

01:49.230 --> 01:51.107
I will attempt to shoot you in the hand.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.931
But I know better
than most there's no guarantees

01:55.030 --> 01:56.770
that you're gonna walk away,

01:56.860 --> 01:58.691
or walk away alive.

02:00.410 --> 02:02.787
Or you can keep your hands up,

02:03.740 --> 02:06.823
turn around, answer one simple question,

02:07.870 --> 02:09.371
and you assuredly live.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.160
Make your choice.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.059
Hey, don't be stupid.

02:40.030 --> 02:41.361
The man will beat you.

03:05.260 --> 03:06.306
What do you want?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.765
I want answers.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.135
You rig this yourself?

03:53.020 --> 03:54.806
Thought I was the one
asking the questions.

03:56.650 --> 03:57.776
How many rounds does it fire?

03:57.860 --> 03:58.975
Enough.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.481
What's the spread like?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.155
I know what you're thinking.

04:11.330 --> 04:14.072
But my guns aren't for hire,
and my bullets aren't for sale.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.660
Why not?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.587
I stay behind the camera.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.832
You really think you can stand by
and watch it transpire?

04:23.550 --> 04:24.960
Wouldn't be the first time.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.636
How about we just stick to our deal?

04:28.640 --> 04:31.097
A ride for your story.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.769
I've heard some of it.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.060
I want to hear all of it.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.900
You can ask us whatever you want.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.451
As long as you get us there.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.797
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:00.380 --> 05:04.009
Yeah. You go out there,
you pick the bones, you meet up.

05:04.090 --> 05:07.332
I just want to know
where you're gonna meet up next.

05:07.430 --> 05:10.638
I told you. I'm not with
whoever you think I'm with.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.880
Yeah?

05:15.640 --> 05:17.517
Ah...

05:18.480 --> 05:21.938
I seen one of these before. _
It belonged to a guy In an El CamIno.

05:22.610 --> 05:24.316
But you already knew that, didn't you?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.197
Yeah. What else don't you know?

05:26.820 --> 05:28.026
What happened to her?

05:28.530 --> 05:29.906
- Who?_
- Naomi.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.901
This was her gun. She was at that stadium.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.906
- What happened to her?
- I don't know. I swear.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.206
I joined up after all that.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.574
Tell me!

05:36.670 --> 05:37.739
- Hey!
- What happened to her?

05:37.830 --> 05:39.457
- Hey, John!
- Tell me!

05:39.540 --> 05:40.916
John, hey.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.456
-leme!
-John!Hey!

05:42.550 --> 05:44.040
- He knows!
-John!

05:44.130 --> 05:45.506
Let him go.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.420
Come on, man. Let him go.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.216
Just let him go.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.518
You tell the rest of your group to stay
clear of where they were gonna meet.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.840
There are people heading there now.

05:58.940 --> 06:01.852
- What people?
- People who want to kill you.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.469
You hear me?

06:09.450 --> 06:10.610
I'm sorry.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.981
You better hold on to these.
Just for the time being.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.496
Just in case.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.409
I know it's hard, John.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.620
I don't even know how she died.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.791
Well, we know where A! is taking them now.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.217
We find them, we stop them,

06:35.100 --> 06:38.092
and then you can ask them
whatever you need to know about Naomi.

06:38.810 --> 06:40.516
I just want to know she didn't suffer.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.680
That's all.

06:55.410 --> 06:57.150
You sure you don't want anaesthetic?

06:57.250 --> 07:00.117
No. Save it for someone who might need it.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.370
So, what'd you find out there?

07:09.130 --> 07:11.792
A few canned hams
and a lot of the dead.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.097
How's the patient?

07:14.180 --> 07:16.557
- Hmm, she'll be fine.
- A lot better after I eat.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.224
Well, three canned hams split 48 ways
goes exactly as far as you'd think.

07:20.310 --> 07:22.392
But it's gonna get us
through till the next thing.

07:25.150 --> 07:26.936
- Gonna get cleaned up.
-Mmmmmm.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.230
- Thanks.
- Sure.

07:33.490 --> 07:34.650
Thanks for patching her up.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.025
It was nothing.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.405
You going out again tomorrow?

07:39.290 --> 07:40.860
Don't think we have much choice.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.706
No matter how dangerous it is.

07:51.050 --> 07:54.838
So, what new and exciting locale
are we visiting today?

07:54.930 --> 07:57.842
Look, we can't just get by
finding a few cans of food here and there.

07:57.930 --> 08:01.388
We need to find a place
with seeds and fertilizer.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.971
Let Cole and Strand pick.
They seem to know where to look.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.147
Where exactly did you find
that truck filled with food?

08:08.360 --> 08:13.980
Oh. In a garage near that old housing
development off the county road.

08:14.070 --> 08:16.868
Someone must have loaded it up
to make their escape

08:16.950 --> 08:18.656
but never got a chance to get it out.

08:20.370 --> 08:21.860
I'm going to get some more ammo.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.967
Cole, thanks for covering for me.

08:34.050 --> 08:35.836
Nah. I should be thanking you.

08:35.930 --> 08:36.965
For what?

08:37.050 --> 08:38.460
For saving me time.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.768
For showing me who you really are
before I thought you were someone else.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.728
So why not tell them?
You've got no obligation to me.

08:49.110 --> 08:50.225
Honestly?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.487
I'm just not sure
what you'd do to me if I did.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.325
Everything okay?

09:05.830 --> 09:06.785
Yeah.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.247
Victor, I didn't want to start
a conversation with, "You're not okay."

09:10.340 --> 09:11.546
What's going on?

09:12.550 --> 09:14.165
People are getting irritable.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.717
A slice of processed ham
does not a meal make.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.383
Well, found this
in the back of the pantry. You want to...

09:22.470 --> 09:23.630
Yes.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.561
They don't give up easy.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.601
No. They don't.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.245
Why'd you do it?

09:48.210 --> 09:49.370
Do what?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.331
Save me after what I did.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.676
I wasn't gonna leave you to drown.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.346
But you didn't just pull me
out of the water.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.057
You brought me back to that cave.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.393
You nursed me back to health. With Alicia.

10:09.270 --> 10:12.933
Nick when he could manage.
You went out and found Luciana.

10:14.610 --> 10:18.444
I was in bad shape. You could've left long
before I was able to walk, but you didn't.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.157
You waited for me.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.195
After everything.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.286
Why?

10:29.460 --> 10:31.280
'Cause I know who you are, Victor.

10:32.670 --> 10:34.752
That, and I really like drinking with you.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.465
Hey, stop!

10:41.600 --> 10:42.840
What the hell?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.051
Get out!

10:45.390 --> 10:46.800
I said get out!

10:46.890 --> 10:48.881
Turn the truck off!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.356
What's going on, Viv?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.067
She said Doug needed our help

10:53.150 --> 10:55.562
and then opened the gate
and tried to get out before we got back.

10:57.780 --> 10:58.849
I can explain.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.736
What's there to explain?
You were ditching out on us.

11:00.820 --> 11:01.866
Again.

11:01.950 --> 11:04.441
Look, if you don't want to stay,
you don't have to sneak out.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.112
And you can have the truck.
You're the one who found it.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.576
It's not like that.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.280
I wasn't leaving. I was...

11:13.170 --> 11:14.330
I was going here.

11:15.550 --> 11:16.619
Why?

11:18.300 --> 11:22.543
There might be seeds, maybe fertilizer,
some food, even. Military rations.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.595
How do you know that?

11:25.350 --> 11:26.760
Place I used to be.

11:27.810 --> 11:29.550
Place that used to be.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.892
Are there still people there?
People there that know you?

11:36.190 --> 11:37.350
There has to_ be a reason
why you didn't tell us

11:37.440 --> 11:39.180
about this magical supply of resources

11:39.280 --> 11:40.895
before we started
down the road to starvation.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.275
It's dangerous.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.362
It might be too dangerous.
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

11:46.450 --> 11:49.408
Well, no one goes out alone.
I'm coming with you.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.616
- I'm coming, too.
- And we'll go.

11:51.790 --> 11:52.825
No.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.990
Alicia, somebody's got to keep an eye
on our friends out there.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.955
And if we come back
with what she says we will,

11:57.050 --> 11:58.756
we're gonna need the fields
ready to plant.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.517
They'll be back.

12:52.770 --> 12:53.930
There.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.892
We should just park up for the night.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.391
Three things we are in desperate need of.

13:20.340 --> 13:21.455
Let's clear it.

13:48.450 --> 13:50.486
These are no good. Let's try the office.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.480
- Couple guns.
-Mmmmmm.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.627
Killed each other over some cans of beans.

14:53.890 --> 14:55.016
Where have you been?

14:55.850 --> 14:57.169
Shopping for dinner.

15:01.270 --> 15:03.397
Oh, smoked jalapeo, your favourite.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.219
Yeah? Since when?

15:05.320 --> 15:06.389
Since Roswell.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.560
Ah...

15:07.650 --> 15:09.231
The Lagavulin.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.481
- I know. It was one hell of a mini bar.
- Yeah.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.618
You guys have been
to a lot of places like this.

15:14.370 --> 15:15.485
Yeah. Some better.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.740
Some worse.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.200
It was a long trip from Mexico.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.376
You started in Mexico?

15:22.670 --> 15:24.240
Los Angeles.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.956
Something like three lifetimes ago.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.879
So, Naomi,
you heard about our sordid past.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.558
Let's hear about yours.
Where exactly are we going tomorrow?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.351
An abandoned FEMA shelter.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.430
You lived there?

15:48.360 --> 15:49.395
What happened?

15:49.900 --> 15:52.653
I don't really want to think about that.
So no more questions.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.150
You just have to trust me.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.208
How do you know the supplies
are even still there?

16:02.710 --> 16:05.201
If you want us to trust you,
you got to give us something.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.207
It's not the kind of place
you'd go looking for seeds.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.006
What about for food?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.541
No one would see this place
and want to go in for anything.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.295
Hmm, except for you.

16:16.890 --> 16:18.005
Victor.

16:23.140 --> 16:24.300
I wasn't.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.145
You weren't what?

16:28.480 --> 16:31.392
I wasn't leaving to go get seeds
when Viv caught me.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.361
You were just leaving?

16:38.030 --> 16:39.156
I was gonna leave the map behind

16:39.240 --> 16:41.322
when I closed the gate
so you'd know where to go.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.451
In case you wanted to try.

16:43.960 --> 16:44.995
Why?

16:45.380 --> 16:46.916
Because she's a coward.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.871
You're right. That's what I am.

16:54.470 --> 16:55.539
The keys.

16:56.430 --> 16:57.465
Hand them over.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.300
I wasn't leaving because of you.

17:09.110 --> 17:10.350
And I didn't leave.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.812
Because you couldn't. And now you can't.

17:15.530 --> 17:16.599
I didn't have to tell you.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.077
So we should thank you
for showing us who you really are?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.439
Victor, hey.

17:23.330 --> 17:24.991
Okay. So, you told us.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.660
That counts for something.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.792
Come on. We should all get
a little shut-eye before tomorrow.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.560
Shit.

17:54.030 --> 17:55.190
Victor, wake up.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.126
Might be able to catch up with her.

19:36.210 --> 19:37.871
What makes you think this is
where she's going?

19:37.960 --> 19:40.008
She said it was dangerous.
The fewer people that went, the better.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.580
Which is why she left it to us.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.593
If she wanted to leave,
she wouldn't have told us the truth.

19:45.930 --> 19:48.728
Why can't you accept the fact that
maybe some people can't be saved?

19:48.810 --> 19:52.223
I get it. You got stuff you're ashamed of.
I have, too.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.398
You got to take your opportunities
to make up for it.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.107
All that stuff's in the past.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.059
It was a week ago.

20:01.650 --> 20:03.561
The car that Cole and I found?

20:03.660 --> 20:06.447
We didn't find.
It was my contingency plan,

20:06.530 --> 20:08.361
my way out in case things got too hard.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.200
I'd been stocking it for weeks.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.286
You see, Madison?

20:16.750 --> 20:18.081
People don't change.

20:19.460 --> 20:25.888
When pressed, when cornered,
the artifice falls and the curtain drops.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.677
They always show you who they really are.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.305
What do you want me to say?

20:37.650 --> 20:39.641
That I should've left you
out there to drown?

20:44.700 --> 20:46.190
That's what I would've done.

20:48.030 --> 20:49.782
Well, lucky for you I'm not you.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.320
I'm so sorry.

26:10.310 --> 26:11.436
Naomi!

26:11.980 --> 26:14.278
There's a truck parked out
on the loading dock.

26:14.360 --> 26:16.271
It has everything you need!

26:16.360 --> 26:17.520
Let us help you.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.982
No. Don't. He was right.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.660
I think I can get to her.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.045
Okay. Go.

26:36.840 --> 26:37.920
Cover me.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.776
Hey!

26:58.200 --> 27:00.100
Over here! Hey!

27:15.170 --> 27:17.627
Come on, Naomi. I got you.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.216
Come on. You can do it. Come on!

27:27.100 --> 27:28.419
Come on. You can do it!

27:48.950 --> 27:50.030
All right.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.586
That's it. Come on. You got it.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.502
Shit! Shit!

28:01.590 --> 28:02.579
Shit!

28:17.320 --> 28:18.935
- Come on. I got you. I got you.
- Okay.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.349
- We got you.
- Okay.

28:21.740 --> 28:22.855
Come on.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.157
We got you! We got you! Come on!

28:36.790 --> 28:38.587
- You're clear. You're clear.
- Okay. Okay.

29:04.030 --> 29:06.066
I needed to try to make up for what I did.

29:06.820 --> 29:09.197
It had to be me in there,
not you, not anyone.

29:11.290 --> 29:12.746
They were good people.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.206
People I thought we could be safe with.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.045
"We"?

29:29.010 --> 29:30.056
My daughter.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.056
You don't have to tell us.

29:39.020 --> 29:40.897
You don't owe us anything, Naomi.

29:46.070 --> 29:47.560
Her name was Rose.

29:51.370 --> 29:53.247
Her father died right after
everything went bad,

29:53.330 --> 29:55.537
and I swore
that was not gonna happen to her.

29:56.620 --> 30:01.205
This place had food, it had water,
and people who knew how to survive.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.581
There was a woman named Ellen.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.046
She taught me how to make it out there.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.792
She taught classes. Called them JIC.

30:08.890 --> 30:09.925
What's JIC?

30:10.470 --> 30:11.846
"Just in case."

30:12.220 --> 30:14.768
She said you had to
be prepared for anything.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.839
And I wasn't.

30:24.530 --> 30:27.442
One day, Rose woke with a cough.

30:27.530 --> 30:28.940
I thought it was a cold.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.525
And then, a week later,
it turned into pneumonia,

30:31.620 --> 30:33.190
and I knew she needed antibiotics.

30:34.950 --> 30:38.363
So I hid her in the pantry
behind the food court when I went out,

30:38.460 --> 30:41.031
and I told her to lock the door
if anything happened.

30:42.550 --> 30:43.949
It took me three days.

30:46.840 --> 30:51.425
I didn't eat, I didn't sleep,
and I found that amoxicillin!

30:54.270 --> 30:56.010
I actually found it.

30:57.020 --> 30:59.682
But by the time I got back here
with the medicine...

31:03.320 --> 31:04.890
It wasn't your fault, Naomi.

31:05.780 --> 31:06.815
It was.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.312
No, you couldn't have kept that many dead
out even if you'd been here.

31:10.950 --> 31:12.906
The dead didn't get inside.

31:12.990 --> 31:14.196
They didn't have to.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.905
I didn't tell anyone how sick Rose was

31:16.000 --> 31:17.570
because I didn't want anyone
to know the truth

31:17.660 --> 31:19.321
because I thought they would kick us out.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.786
I'd seen that happen at a place
we were at before.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.000
Rose...

31:29.090 --> 31:32.218
She died before I got back
with the medicine,

31:32.300 --> 31:35.428
and she turned that first night.

31:36.140 --> 31:37.459
And then...

31:38.060 --> 31:40.767
And then everyone else did, too.

31:41.690 --> 31:42.930
I did this!

31:44.270 --> 31:45.931
You didn't have to come back here.

31:47.740 --> 31:48.980
It had to be me.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.272
It had to be me.
I couldn't run from it any longer.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.280
You wouldn't let me.

32:01.370 --> 32:04.248
Maybe so I could find a way
to live with it.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.912
By helping you keep what you have going.

32:43.790 --> 32:46.998
She prepped the truck,
in case anything went wrong.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.048
Said it'd have everything we need
to start over somewhere else.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.461
She was ready for everything out there.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.090
Just not in here.

33:23.660 --> 33:24.740
Hey.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.836
You did what you did.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.410
You did what you had to do.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.740
What life...

33:37.010 --> 33:38.136
I did, too.

33:41.810 --> 33:42.845
But this one?

33:44.140 --> 33:45.596
She taught me something else.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.015
That...

33:48.900 --> 33:50.060
We can start over.

33:53.780 --> 33:54.986
We all can.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.460
There a problem?

34:16.300 --> 34:17.506
No. We're good.

34:19.890 --> 34:20.959
Then what do you want?

34:21.100 --> 34:22.556
We just want you to listen.

34:24.390 --> 34:25.516
To what?

34:28.150 --> 34:29.686
You might want to make some room.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.737
It's food, supplies, fertilizer.

34:39.910 --> 34:42.367
Gonna rebuild, replant.

34:42.530 --> 34:45.829
So you've picked over everything
in a 50-mile radius.

34:45.910 --> 34:48.538
You must be running pretty low
on food, too.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.386
Pack it up!

35:00.840 --> 35:02.000
Let's go!

35:02.180 --> 35:05.422
They'll take longer than we can wait.
Come on.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.029
You be careful, Madison.

35:30.460 --> 35:35.454
In my experience, the really bad stuff...
Never see it coming.

36:30.430 --> 36:32.341
- Will you look at that.
- Hey.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.646
Is it enough?

36:35.730 --> 36:37.106
It's enough, yeah.

36:38.780 --> 36:39.849
All right.

36:53.210 --> 36:56.418
I got to say, I didn't think
you was gonna pull this one off.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.081
Neither did I.

37:01.130 --> 37:02.210
She did.

37:04.090 --> 37:05.830
I think she knows me better
than I know myself.

37:06.800 --> 37:11.260
And I may have been premature
in telling you who I am.

37:13.350 --> 37:15.306
Just for clarification on that point.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.942
Madison, we need to talk.

37:24.780 --> 37:27.908
We won today. You were a big part of it.
Let's leave it at that.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.220
Mom.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.680
People are excited. They're eating.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.396
Did you unload everything from the truck?

38:02.030 --> 38:03.065
Yeah.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.480
Do me a favour.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.908
I'm gonna tell you to do something,
and I need you to just do it.

38:07.990 --> 38:10.117
'Cause I don't want to talk about it,
and I don't want to think about it.

38:10.530 --> 38:11.576
Okay.

38:11.660 --> 38:14.037
Grab some rations, a few medical supplies,

38:14.120 --> 38:16.452
couple of rifles from the armoury,
put them in the Land Rover.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.122
Park it at the back of the motor pool.
And, Alicia, keep it quiet.

38:19.210 --> 38:20.370
No one needs to know.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.621
Mom, they left.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.541
- I don't think they're coming back.
- Alicia.

38:29.050 --> 38:30.096
Why?

38:33.560 --> 38:34.629
Just in case.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.080
They're coming.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.000
How many?

39:08.220 --> 39:09.255
One.

39:13.970 --> 39:15.426
Where are the rest of them?

39:33.280 --> 39:34.326
Hello?

39:39.160 --> 39:40.741
Came here to talk!

39:46.130 --> 39:47.836
On the ground.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.296
Hey, you don't understand.

39:49.420 --> 39:50.751
On the ground!

39:57.350 --> 39:58.886
What the hell are you doing here?

40:01.400 --> 40:03.140
We came here to help.

40:03.230 --> 40:05.186
Al, you want to slow this down
a little bit?

40:12.570 --> 40:13.810
They're not coming.

40:14.700 --> 40:16.440
The people you came here looking for.

40:17.620 --> 40:19.861
We found them,
and we told them to stay away.

40:20.830 --> 40:22.115
All right, all right.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.035
Badidea.

40:28.090 --> 40:29.296
Still got time.

40:30.670 --> 40:33.173
You don't have to do this.
I should've told that to Nick.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.386
I'm telling you now.
You should listen to me.

40:38.270 --> 40:41.888
'Cause what you're doing
is only gonna make things worse.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.607
Perhaps they didn't heed
your warning after all.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.394
Hey.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.031
Which one of them told you they'd be here?

41:45.120 --> 41:46.747
Blue shirt over there.

41:48.290 --> 41:49.700
Much appreciated.

41:56.470 --> 41:57.585
Hey.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.341
I'm sorry about your brother.

42:04.310 --> 42:05.345
Really?

42:07.190 --> 42:08.976
I'm not sorry about yours.

42:13.940 --> 42:15.066
Hey. Hey.

42:16.450 --> 42:17.485
Doesn't have to go this way.

42:17.570 --> 42:18.867
Yes, it does.

42:19.490 --> 42:22.323
But you don't have to get
in the middle of it. Get out of the way.

42:22.410 --> 42:23.695
- Move.
- No.

42:29.830 --> 42:30.956
Where is even/one?

42:36.510 --> 42:37.795
You didn't tell her.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.381
Uh-uh.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.381
You aren't gonna like this.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.606
The Land Rover.
Where the hell did you get that?

43:13.550 --> 43:14.665
Laura?

43:17.220 --> 43:18.335
John?

43:23.560 --> 43:24.629
No.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.640
No!

43:33.730 --> 43:34.810
Wait!

43:37.320 --> 43:38.355
No!
