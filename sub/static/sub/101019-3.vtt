00:01.668 --> 00:03.003
VICTOR:
Dear Simon,

00:03.003 --> 00:04.922
when I came out in
front of the whole school,

00:04.922 --> 00:07.299
I said I didn't care
what people think...

00:07.299 --> 00:09.510
‐ Yes, queen!

00:09.510 --> 00:12.012
VICTOR: But people sure don't mind
telling me what they think.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.473
‐ I want you to know that I see you.

00:15.724 --> 00:16.975
‐ Thanks.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.602
‐ Love is love.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.730
VICTOR:
It's like coming out gave everyone
an excuse to share their opinion.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.900
Or to get my opinion about things
I know nothing about.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.485
‐ Hey, girl!

00:26.485 --> 00:27.736
‐ Me?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.321
‐ What do you moisturize with?

00:29.947 --> 00:31.740
‐ Water.
‐ Water?

00:32.407 --> 00:34.451
[laughs]

00:34.451 --> 00:37.788
Fine, don't share with us
your flawless skin secrets, bitch!

00:38.705 --> 00:40.082
‐ Okay. [chuckles]

00:42.960 --> 00:44.545
I never thought coming out would be

00:44.545 --> 00:47.297
an invitation for strangers to talk to me.

00:47.297 --> 00:51.260
Or that the people I used to talk to
would suddenly feel like strangers.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.345
COACH FORD:
Hey, Salazar!

00:54.179 --> 00:55.681
Do you mind if we chat?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.891
‐ Um, yeah, sure.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.312
COACH FORD:
First day of practice.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.231
How's my star player?

01:04.231 --> 01:05.816
‐ Uh, excited.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.818
I've been practicing
my jump shot all summer.

01:07.818 --> 01:08.902
‐ Great.

01:13.615 --> 01:18.412
So, um, I heard about
your recent announcement.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.624
‐ [chuckles] Yeah. It's okay.
We, we really don't have to talk about it.

01:22.624 --> 01:26.295
‐ Listen, I think it's awesome.
I really do. Um...

01:26.295 --> 01:28.380
I mean, I'm basically gay, myself.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.341
I've been living with my best friend
Mike for twenty years,

01:31.341 --> 01:34.636
and we share a SodaStream, so...

01:35.888 --> 01:37.890
Okay, um...

01:37.890 --> 01:41.059
The point I'm trying to make
is that I want you

01:41.059 --> 01:43.478
to feel comfortable and safe

01:43.478 --> 01:46.523
both on the court,
and in the locker room.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.442
And also, uh, in fact,

01:48.442 --> 01:52.362
if‐if you would now like to maybe change
away from the other guys,

01:52.362 --> 01:54.072
I mean, we could figure that out.

01:54.072 --> 01:58.202
I actually have an empty coach's office
that nobody's using.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.494
It's got its own shower.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.288
I mean,
you'd have your own changing area!

02:01.288 --> 02:03.373
I mean, Steph Curry
doesn't even have that.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.459
‐ Uh, thanks, but I'll just keep

02:05.459 --> 02:07.586
showering and changing
with the rest of the team.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.339
‐ Victor, um...
[chuckles nervously]

02:10.339 --> 02:12.674
It's, it's not a big deal, but, uh,

02:12.674 --> 02:14.843
there have been some complaints.

02:15.427 --> 02:18.263
‐ Complaints about me changing
with the team?

02:19.014 --> 02:21.767
‐ I'm just trying to keep
everybody happy, okay?

02:21.767 --> 02:23.894
So would you think about it?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.104
You're a good kid, Victor.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.273
And I'm very proud of you.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.859
I'll see you at practice. Go, Grizzlies.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.032
‐ ♪ Somebody to tell me
it'll be all right ♪

02:37.032 --> 02:39.952
♪ Somebody to tell me
it'll be just fine ♪

02:39.952 --> 02:43.413
♪ If someone has been there before,
say it right now ♪

02:43.413 --> 02:45.749
♪ 'Cause I just need to hear it ♪

02:47.876 --> 02:51.171

02:51.171 --> 02:53.799
TYLER [over phone]:
I still don't get what you're going for.

02:53.799 --> 02:58.595
‐ Um, if I say it's a, a, a
physical manifestation

02:58.595 --> 03:01.807
of the metaphysical
human experience,

03:01.807 --> 03:05.060
does that make me pretentious?

03:05.477 --> 03:09.314
‐ Very. But it also makes you pretty cool.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.192
Where are you, anyway?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.820
Why are you working there
instead of the campus studio?

03:14.820 --> 03:18.615
‐ Um, so I'm in a, a warehouse off‐campus.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.951
That's a really nice sketch.

03:20.951 --> 03:25.497
‐ Thanks. It's a surrealist take
on my parents' backyard.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.499
‐ How much longer are you gonna
hide out in here during lunch

03:27.499 --> 03:29.293
because you're avoiding Victor‐‐

03:29.293 --> 03:32.379
[scribbling]
TYLER [over phone]:
And that's the totally non‐obnoxious way

03:32.379 --> 03:34.464
I'll fail to be the next Kehinde Wiley.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.092
‐ That is so, uh, thought‐provoking.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.760
Uh, what are you up to tonight?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.387
‐ I need to finish this piece,

03:40.387 --> 03:44.725
but, uh, there's a party on Buck Row
I was maybe gonna hit up. Why?

03:44.725 --> 03:47.144
‐ Um, no reason. I, um,

03:47.144 --> 03:50.272
I'm mean, I'm probably gonna
just be working, too,

03:50.272 --> 03:52.608
but, uh, maybe send me the deets,

03:52.608 --> 03:54.860
and if I finish early, I'll stop by.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.279
‐ Sounds like a plan.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.656
Bye, Mia.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.992
‐ Bye.
[phone beeps]

04:02.618 --> 04:04.786
[Lake squeals, laughs]
Was that cool?

04:04.786 --> 04:07.915
‐ Um, making art while
seducing older men?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.166
You are literally Beyoncé.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.294
‐ I just got invited to a college party.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.463
Wait. Okay, if I'm a cool college kid,

04:14.463 --> 04:16.381
I need some cool college friends,

04:16.381 --> 04:18.800
so are you and Felix down to come?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.636
‐ Yes. We need a fun night out.

04:20.636 --> 04:21.845
Now come have lunch with us

04:21.845 --> 04:23.764
so we can plan our college party looks.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.892
‐ Oh, no...

04:26.892 --> 04:29.144
This was for my grandma.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.524
‐ Oops.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.194
[indistinct chatter]

04:45.911 --> 04:47.412
‐ Rainbow sprinkles.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.581
A little on the nose, right?
[chuckles]

04:49.581 --> 04:51.333
‐ Okay, let's get started.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.627
Welcome to PFLAG.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.381
For our first timers,
this is a support group

04:57.381 --> 05:01.552
for parents, families,
and allies of LGBTQ people.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.555
My name is Jack. My son Simon
came out a few years back,

05:04.555 --> 05:08.016
and we're here to talk about
how great, and weird,

05:08.016 --> 05:09.434
and complicated coming out can be.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.478
Not just for the people doing it...

05:11.478 --> 05:13.230
but for all of us.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.065
Uh, sir.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.903
Why don't you start us off?
What's your story?

05:19.903 --> 05:22.573
‐ Sure. Uh, okay, uh,

05:22.573 --> 05:25.993
I'm Armando, and my son just came out.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.952
Yeah.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.913
That's pretty much my story.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.333
Who in your family's gay?

05:37.212 --> 05:39.131
‐ Here she is.

05:39.131 --> 05:42.009
Five‐hundred words, ready to go.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.011
‐ There's nothing
too smart in here, right?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.762
Like any words I wouldn't know
or anything?

05:45.762 --> 05:47.097
‐ It's a solid C plus. Yeah.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.309
We want your improvement to be
miraculous, but believable.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.476
‐ Thanks.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.689
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.566
How it's going with your mom?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.860
‐ Still not great,

05:59.860 --> 06:02.362
but I have a new side hustle
to make rent,

06:02.362 --> 06:05.240
and I can pay you back this week.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.576
‐ Cool. No rush.
‐ Cool.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.873
‐ Hey. If you ever wanna, like,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.625
hang out to vent or whatever...

06:14.625 --> 06:16.084
I'm around.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.046
‐ Yeah. Yeah, that would
actually be great.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.672
Thanks.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.549
LAKE:
Hey, bae. Exciting news.

06:22.549 --> 06:26.637
So, we are going with Mia
to a college party tonight.

06:27.763 --> 06:31.475
‐ Uh, tonight?
Uh, I kind of have a lot of homework.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.644
‐ Again? I mean, you're like, crazy smart,

06:33.644 --> 06:35.604
and this school isn't even that good.
What's going on?

06:35.604 --> 06:39.274
‐ I may have started a little business

06:39.274 --> 06:41.527
writing essays for kids.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.696
‐ What? Felix, cheating is serious.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.990
I mean, look what happened
to Olivia Jade's mom.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.743
And more importantly,
Olivia Jade's brand.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.496
I mean, what do you even
need the money for?

06:53.497 --> 06:54.873
‐ DJ equipment.

06:54.873 --> 06:58.877
Yeah, I'm saving up for the new
Pioneer DDJ‐1000SRT‐‐

06:58.877 --> 07:01.505
‐ Okay, I need you to stop
saying letters at me.

07:01.505 --> 07:06.301
Felix, I mean, DJ equipment
is not a good reason to cheat.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.013
Or to totally blow off
your girlfriend all week.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.515
I miss you.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.517
‐ I miss you, too.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.728
Okay. All right, I'll,
I'll go to the party.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.105
‐ Yay! Thank you.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.358
So, uh, do you wanna come over
after school so we can hang out before?

07:21.358 --> 07:22.609
‐ Sounds great.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.445
‐ I'm really sorry, Vic.
‐ Sorry about what?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.990
‐ Some guys on my team don't want me
changing with them.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.575
‐ What the hell?
‐ Seriously?

07:29.575 --> 07:31.034
‐ Yeah, I know.
What kind of insecure asshole

07:31.034 --> 07:32.661
can't handle showering around a gay guy?

07:32.661 --> 07:34.329
‐ This is bullshit.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.373
VICTOR:
It's just so stupid.

07:36.373 --> 07:40.377
You know, like, I, I've been changing
with these guys for over a year now.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.129
Do they think that now that I'm out,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.214
I'm gonna turn into
some kind of sexual predator?

07:44.214 --> 07:47.676
‐ Seriously. But also, like, why are they
worried about you looking at them?

07:47.676 --> 07:51.346
You are literally dating the
most gorgeous guy at Creekwood.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.932
FELIX:
Well, I mean, you know... [chuckles]

07:53.932 --> 07:56.310
beauty is in the
eye of the beholder, so...

07:56.310 --> 07:58.478
‐ Yeah. Behold Benji, bitch.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.398
‐ Yeah, I'll be right back.

08:01.398 --> 08:05.110
Uh, hey. Hey, Andrew.
Um, can we talk for a second?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.157
‐ What's up, Salazar?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.658
‐ You know what's up.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.952
‐ All right, listen.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.413
I don't know who complained to Coach Ford,
but it wasn't me.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.416
I don't care who checks me out naked:
guys, girls,

08:19.416 --> 08:22.503
the old widow next door
when I leave the blinds open.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.713
It's all very flattering, you know?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.673
‐ You're the team captain.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.175
You know who complained.

08:29.301 --> 08:32.012
‐ What if I tell you who it is?
Then what?

08:32.012 --> 08:35.015
You call them out, and suddenly
they realize how ignorant they're being

08:35.015 --> 08:36.433
and they apologize to you?

08:37.434 --> 08:41.730
Victor, look, you are the best player
on the team.

08:42.564 --> 08:43.982
‐ So what?

08:43.982 --> 08:48.195
‐ So show up tonight at practice
and, and dominate.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.198
Then hopefully they'll realize
how ignorant and stupid they're being,

08:51.198 --> 08:52.991
and everything will just
go back to normal.

08:52.991 --> 08:56.954
Just be undeniable, yeah?

08:56.954 --> 08:58.288
Trust me.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.965
[indistinct chatter]

09:11.718 --> 09:13.262
‐ Um, hey.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.223
‐ I'll see ya. Armando.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.724
‐ Hey.
‐ Jack.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.769
‐ Jack, hey, uh, listen, I'm,
I'm sorry I didn't say much.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.397
Uh, this is just all pretty new to me.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.898
‐ Are you feeling okay?

09:24.898 --> 09:27.860
‐ Huh? What?
‐ You're really, really sweaty.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.695
‐ Oh, yeah. I sweat when I'm nervous.

09:29.695 --> 09:33.532
Uh, anyway, l‐l‐like I said,
my, my son, um, Victor,

09:33.532 --> 09:35.617
he, he just came out recently,
which, I mean, you know,

09:35.617 --> 09:37.202
he's a basketball player,

09:37.202 --> 09:40.706
so I guess I never really saw that com‐‐

09:40.706 --> 09:43.667
I‐‐ Not that that has anything
to do with who a person wants to‐‐

09:43.667 --> 09:46.253
‐ Listen, I have to get
back to the office.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.755
Maybe we could grab a beer later tonight.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.550
I know that these meetings
can be overwhelming, so...

09:52.384 --> 09:55.470
‐ Jack, that, that would be great,
actually.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.848
And I, I, I promise to change my shirt

09:57.848 --> 09:59.600
into something... yeah.
‐ [laughs] Okay.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.602
‐ Less moist.
‐ Moist.

10:02.978 --> 10:06.106
I hate that word.
Yeah. Don't...

10:06.106 --> 10:07.399
‐ I don't know why I said that.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.942
JACK: All right. I'll see ya.
‐ Okay.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.363
COACH FORD: All right, Grizzlies.
Bring it in. Gather up!

10:14.448 --> 10:17.868
Welcome to the first practice
of the season.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.453
I hope you all had a good summer.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.496
I rented the cutest little lake house.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.541
And then I got a staph infection
on day one. I...

10:24.541 --> 10:26.752
Went through me like a wildfire.

10:26.752 --> 10:29.630
I almost lost a finger. But I didn't.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.216
I didn't lose my pinky,

10:32.216 --> 10:35.511

23:06.845 --> 23:09.515
is the most important thing
you've ever done, and...

23:09.515 --> 23:11.808
I am glad you did it.

23:13.018 --> 23:14.937
Because I want you to be happy.

the most important thing you've ever done

23:25.280 --> 23:27.032
didn't make me feel like shit.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.370
I wish I didn't lose my best friend.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.208
‐ You didn't lose me.

23:36.208 --> 23:40.629
I'm right here, and I miss you so much.

23:42.297 --> 23:43.924
And I love you, too.

23:47.970 --> 23:51.473
‐ This is not how I used to imagine
our first "I love you"s.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.853
‐ You are so amazing.
You know that?

23:55.853 --> 23:58.689
‐ Okay‐‐
‐ No, no. I'm, I'm serious. Like...

24:00.232 --> 24:03.861
Even after everything, you still...

24:06.029 --> 24:07.865
You still want me to be me.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.658
‐ Of course I do.

24:09.658 --> 24:11.910
What kind of person wouldn't?

I just, I, I liked you, and I,
I wanted to hang out with you.

24:58.832 --> 25:02.878
But, um, if you don't want to hang out
with me anymore, I‐‐

25:02.878 --> 25:04.880

25:04.880 --> 25:06.757
I turned 18 last month.
