00:44.503 --> 00:46.171
How do you leave someone?

00:47.756 --> 00:50.259
Really truly leave them.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.263
Leave them so far behind that

00:55.597 --> 00:56.723
it's like you never met?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.244
‐ Maybe you should do another one.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.161
‐ Sam.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.544
‐ W‐what do you want to do?

01:28.881 --> 01:30.007
‐ I just want to sit here.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.510
‐ Yeah, but‐‐

01:40.559 --> 01:42.769
Look, G, I just want you to know
that I support you

01:42.769 --> 01:44.271
in whatever decision you want to make.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.150
‐ Okay.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.321
‐ G, can you say something?

01:52.321 --> 01:53.197
‐ Sam.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.742
I know you're trying
to be sweet right now

01:58.785 --> 02:01.205
and that you're worried about me.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.000
But just stop.

02:10.088 --> 02:10.881
‐ Let's get married, G.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.177
Let's do it. I'm serious.
Let's get married.

02:16.803 --> 02:17.721
What?

02:19.389 --> 02:20.224
I love you.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.146
‐ They're here.

02:26.605 --> 02:27.773
I don't want to make them wait.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.292
I want you to order
a self‐drive on the way home.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.836
I don't want anyone driving. Okay?

02:50.796 --> 02:53.173
Sam, you're backing me up
on this, right?

02:55.551 --> 02:56.301
Sam?

02:57.553 --> 02:58.804
‐ Uh, yes.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.974
Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Olsen,
I got you.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.892
‐ Whose parents are gonna be there?

03:03.892 --> 03:06.520
‐ No one's parents, Dad.
We're in college.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.189
‐ Are you okay?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.691
‐ You look a little green
around the gills.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.609
‐ I'm fine, Mom. I'm just‐‐

03:13.777 --> 03:15.070
Can I have my coat, please, Eli?

03:15.070 --> 03:15.946
Yes, ma'am.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.573
‐ You need a scarf, too.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.199
You're not wearing enough.

03:20.075 --> 03:20.951
What is this?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.328
‐ It's mine. And I want it back.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.998
Uh, my purse too, thank you.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.835
MR.
Have fun, you two. Be safe.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.462
‐ Yes, sir, we won't be out too long.
Good night, Mrs. Olsen.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.590
Thank you, Eli.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.384
‐ Happy Halloween, sir.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.138
‐ Eli, it's Christmas.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.226
‐ Of course. Merry Christmas, sir.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.330
Ow.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.208
‐ Missed. Alright.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.668
Oh!

04:12.294 --> 04:13.128
Shit.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.967
Since 1969,

04:18.967 --> 04:22.054
Raster Robotics has delivered
cutting‐edge AI‐‐

04:22.513 --> 04:23.889
‐ Your hot chocolate, sir.

04:24.848 --> 04:25.849
‐ Thank you, Daniel.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.476
‐ Oh, does this have, uh, rum in it?

04:27.476 --> 04:28.477
‐ It does not, sir.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.729
‐ Okay, shots for everyone, Daniel.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.190
‐ I'm sorry, your parents put
a restriction on shots served.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.150
‐ Ten‐two‐six‐six.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.445
‐ Right away.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.072
‐ With limes.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.074
‐ Do you have my phone?
I can't find it.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.742
‐ No, I don't. Did you leave it?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.244
‐ Fuck. Did I ever give it to you?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.995
‐ Uh, I'm, I'm good.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.830
Let me take that for you, G.
‐ What?

04:49.248 --> 04:50.666
‐ G, you shouldn't be drinking.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.416
‐ Stop.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.252
‐ Yo, are you two fighting?

04:53.252 --> 04:54.378
You seem like you're fighting.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.128
‐ We're fine.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.505
‐ I didn't ask you, Samuel.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.215
Sam, you're embarrassing me.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.132
Sam.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.010
...elevate your
android's evolution like never before.

05:02.010 --> 05:02.678
‐ Really?

05:02.678 --> 05:04.471
Get the new OS this Christmas,

05:05.180 --> 05:07.015
...from Raster Robotics.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.100
‐ Dude, chill.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.601
More than human.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.396
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the elbows.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.939
‐ I've got it, sir.
Not to worry.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.274
Is this the first time you ever played?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.320
‐ I'm pregnant.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.748
God, I'm scared.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.006
He's trying to be so sweet.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.926
And... I'm not ready for this.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.053
I'm not even sure
that I want to be with him.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.265
‐ Did you tell him?

05:48.765 --> 05:49.641
‐ Yes.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.353
That's why he's being
so fucking dumb right now.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.440
Fuck.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.193
Fuck.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.236
Ugh.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.322
So what are you going to do?

06:07.951 --> 06:10.287
‐ I... think I'm gonna have‐‐

06:26.970 --> 06:28.138
What the fuck?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.601
Stop! Stop!

06:36.522 --> 06:37.439
‐ Sam?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.362
‐ Ten‐two‐six‐six.
Daniel, no!

06:43.362 --> 06:45.197
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

06:52.037 --> 06:53.539
‐ Georgia, come on.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.540
‐ Go!

06:55.582 --> 06:56.750
Go to the front door! Go‐‐

06:56.750 --> 06:58.377
G, go back, go back, go back.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.423
No!

07:09.304 --> 07:10.222
‐ Sam!

07:42.796 --> 07:44.047
He killed them.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.259
They're not supposed
to be able to do that.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.636
They're programmed not to be able
to do that.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.806
Stop it! Help me!

08:06.904 --> 08:07.487
Holy shit!

08:11.491 --> 08:12.284
I've got to call my mom.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.452
Holy shit!

08:13.452 --> 08:14.661
‐ My mom.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.829
Call the cops!

08:17.956 --> 08:19.291
‐ Oh shit.
‐ Sarah!

08:19.708 --> 08:21.251
Sarah. Sarah.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.711
Sarah. No!

08:23.253 --> 08:24.046
Sarah.
‐ G.

08:25.214 --> 08:25.964
What the fuck?

08:49.821 --> 08:50.739
Fawn?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.158
Fawn?

08:53.158 --> 08:54.868
Yeah. Like a baby deer.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.744
Mm‐mm.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.870
Or Leaf?

08:56.870 --> 08:57.996
Mm‐mm.
- Leaf.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.373
Who the hell are you?

08:59.373 --> 09:01.583
You said you wanted
something to do with nature.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.502
Uh, yeah, sure. But, I meant‐‐

09:04.044 --> 09:05.087
I don't know, something like

09:06.630 --> 09:08.131
River or‐‐

09:08.131 --> 09:12.219
Or what? Because River is
so much better than Leaf.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.262
I'm sorry.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.305
- It is, actually.
- Oh yeah?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.224
Alright, forget nature.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.685
What's your first choice
for a girl?

09:20.310 --> 09:22.563
‐ How are you so sure that this

09:23.146 --> 09:24.273
is a baby girl?

09:27.276 --> 09:28.277
‐ I can tell.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.030
‐ I'm telling you

09:32.906 --> 09:33.866
it's a boy.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.325
‐ Well, it's not.
‐ Yes, it is.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.535
‐ Shut up.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.162
I'm having girl dreams.

09:39.538 --> 09:40.372
‐ Mm.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.876
Yeah, you also had a dream
you gave birth to a pony.

09:43.876 --> 09:44.960
‐ Mm‐mm.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.171
No, I didn't.
‐ You having a pony too?

09:47.171 --> 09:49.339
‐ No, I didn't.
‐ Oh my god. Yes, you did.

09:49.339 --> 09:49.965
‐ When?

09:49.965 --> 09:51.550
‐ You told me you were gonna break up
with me when I said

09:51.550 --> 09:53.677
we can ride that pony.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.056
Oh no!

09:58.056 --> 10:00.267
I totally forgot about that.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.518
And we named her something.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.227
G.

10:03.228 --> 10:03.979
What?

10:04.688 --> 10:05.898
Did you hear that?

10:07.357 --> 10:08.233
‐ No.

10:32.591 --> 10:33.717
Come back in, Sam.

10:35.802 --> 10:36.970
‐ I think it's just an animal.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.639
Come on.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.795
What's up, squirrel?

11:11.755 --> 11:12.714
Did you sleep alright?

11:15.759 --> 11:16.635
‐ No.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.347
Bad dreams.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.390
‐ Mm.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.141
You okay?

11:24.768 --> 11:25.936
‐ My back hurts.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.312
My boobs hurt.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.064
My feet hurt.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.359
And she won't... stop kicking.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.027
‐ He.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.242
‐ Come on, babe, we got
to get going, seriously.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.368
‐ Ugh.

11:43.996 --> 11:44.913
Oh.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.010
You okay?

11:58.510 --> 12:00.095
‐ Yeah, my feet.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.472
Oh.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.599
‐ Keep telling you...

12:04.391 --> 12:06.101
You need to get the All Stars.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.575
We've got
to clear six miles by sundown.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.412
As long as we stay away from the road,
I think we'll be okay.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.167
‐ You okay?

13:13.335 --> 13:15.295
‐ I’m always afraid
they're gonna shoot us.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.844
‐ Just do what they say. Move slowly.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.029
Stop. Hands up.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.324
Put your packs down
and turn around.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.431
Any weapons?

14:08.182 --> 14:10.976
‐ Uh, yeah, we have a machete
and a revolver.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.645
‐ Where are they?

14:13.645 --> 14:14.730
‐ In the pack.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.985
‐ What's the girl hiding
under her shirt?

14:20.611 --> 14:22.696
‐ I'm nine months pregnant!

14:25.282 --> 14:26.992
‐ Walk backwards towards us.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.286
Slowly.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.042
One at a time.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.293
You, go ahead.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.544
You, stop.

14:42.508 --> 14:44.343
Put your palm up against this fence.

14:54.019 --> 14:54.770
Right over here.

14:57.481 --> 14:58.565
Hold that pack low.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.366
Put your palm up on the fence.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.499
No. No, no, no,
you're over there.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.021
Hey, hey, hey.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.079
DR.Where are you guys
coming from?

15:54.913 --> 15:58.000
After the Blitz, we thought
things would just get better.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.336
We waited out for a few months,
and then we tried to get to New York.

16:01.336 --> 16:05.883
And then on our way to New York,
they detonated the electronic pulse thing.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.050
DR.
The EMP.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.804
Yeah. Grunt freaked out
and triggered it during an attack.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.932
Once the EMP blast radius went down,

16:13.932 --> 16:16.351
the next wave of androids swarmed
the soldiers and‐‐

16:17.060 --> 16:19.563
Well, that was the end
of New York City.

16:20.564 --> 16:22.608
We ended up looping
back up the long way.

16:22.608 --> 16:23.859
And now we're

16:23.859 --> 16:25.319
trying to get to Boston.

16:25.319 --> 16:28.071
DR.- Boston is fortified,
but you can't get straight there.
- Sorry.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.574
DR.The area surrounding it
is No Man's Land.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.036
Gonna be tough unless you can figure out
a way to come in from the sea.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.372
I wouldn't risk it
while you're this far along.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.374
Oh, um,

16:39.374 --> 16:40.751
I actu‐‐ I can ask you.

16:40.751 --> 16:44.421
Uh, when I give birth, I know
that I have to cut the umbilical cord.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.714
I‐I read it that I have to.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.467
How do I get it out of me?
Is it just gonna fall out or‐‐

16:48.467 --> 16:50.010
DR.
You can have the baby here.

16:53.639 --> 16:54.640
‐ What?

16:56.517 --> 16:57.392
I can?

16:58.101 --> 17:01.522
DR.I mean, you're past due.
You really shouldn't be traveling at all.

17:02.981 --> 17:06.318
Sam wants us to get to Boston
before I give birth.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.070
We're trying to get to this.

17:09.571 --> 17:10.489
Look.

17:12.658 --> 17:14.826
Families with a child,
one year or younger,

17:14.826 --> 17:15.869
they qualify to

17:16.828 --> 17:17.996
take a boat somewhere safe.

17:17.996 --> 17:18.914
Maybe Asia.

17:19.623 --> 17:20.707
Have you heard anything about it?

17:21.208 --> 17:25.212
‐ Yeah. Um, couple of months ago,
this is what everyone was doing.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.255
When did you get this?

17:28.465 --> 17:30.342
‐ In the spring. Why?
Did you hear something?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.094
‐ No.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.055
I can ask around for you,

17:35.055 --> 17:38.016
but... I heard they were only taking
the mothers and babies.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.560
No fathers.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.564
It's a food supply thing.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.320
You want to hear the heartbeat?

17:53.782 --> 17:54.992
‐ Ye‐yeah.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.000
Yo, what's up, man?
Can I get one of those?

18:47.044 --> 18:47.961
‐ Nope.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.886
‐ You, uh, you know if they got
any shipments going to Boston?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.013
Anyone I can hitch a ride with?

18:58.680 --> 19:01.141
My girl's pregnant, and we trying to cut
through the No Man's Land.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.310
‐ No one's getting through No Man's Land.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.229
That's why it's called No Man's Land.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.066
‐ Yeah. I just mean maybe there's a way
for us to get to Boston.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.276
‐ Boston is surrounded as fuck.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.321
They got a strong holdout
because of the troops

19:14.321 --> 19:15.364
and the EMPs.

19:15.948 --> 19:17.616
But all it takes is one domino.

19:18.367 --> 19:19.660
‐ What you mean domino?

19:21.620 --> 19:22.913
‐ You got a EMP, right?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.541
You can only detonate it once.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.918
Takes out everything
with an electrical current

19:27.918 --> 19:29.253
within its blast radius.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.129
Then all we got is guns.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.632
Gun only do so much.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.093
But that's what androids want.

19:37.094 --> 19:38.846
Get us to blow an EMP

19:38.846 --> 19:42.099
so they can get up nice... and close.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.564
‐ You, uh... you know if they
still shipping people out?

19:49.773 --> 19:51.817
Like civilians off the coast?

19:53.986 --> 19:55.571
‐ You trying to hop over to China?

19:57.823 --> 19:58.907
‐ Maybe Korea.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.661
Heard it's safer over there.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.581
Maybe just a rumor.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.374
‐ Yeah.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.585
I bet they still have boats.

20:10.836 --> 20:11.753
Hard to say.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.966
I'm not trying to run from this.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.137
‐ I got a family, man.

20:21.972 --> 20:22.973
‐ Who doesn't?

20:42.451 --> 20:45.537
Please, I told you I had
a hip replacement. Just listen to me!

20:45.537 --> 20:46.788
I don't know about
no hip replacement.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.665
All I know is you keep
lighting up my detector.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.292
Now step back!
Please, please!

20:50.292 --> 20:52.085
You want to cut me open?
You wanna see?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.128
I bleed red just like you.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.756
Hey, you got metal
in your bones.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.674
You got five seconds to back off!
Please.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.760
Five!
Get off the fence! Three!

20:59.760 --> 21:01.261
No, please.
They said they would‐‐

21:10.354 --> 21:11.563
The doctor said
she hadn't heard anything

21:11.563 --> 21:13.315
about the family initiative for weeks.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.025
I just talked to a soldier.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.194
He said they still got boats
going out of Boston.

21:17.653 --> 21:19.863
Why would they still have boats
if they're not taking families?

21:21.156 --> 21:22.783
‐ I think we should stay.

21:23.659 --> 21:24.660
We have

21:25.619 --> 21:26.703
shelter.

21:27.246 --> 21:28.372
We got a doctor.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.499
‐ And what happens after?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.877
We got days of walking left,

21:33.877 --> 21:36.547
and we gotta get through No Man's Land
without being noticed.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.967
It's not gonna be easy
with a baby boy with us.

21:45.806 --> 21:47.683
If you can find
a safe way for us to go,

21:48.725 --> 21:51.061
the soldiers can give us
a ride or something,

21:54.231 --> 21:55.065
I'll go.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.323
Fuck. I wish we still had the internet.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.867
‐ Sushi.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.286
‐ Ah. Freezers.

22:08.495 --> 22:12.875
‐ Consistent pair of clean socks.

22:15.836 --> 22:16.879
Oh.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.016
‐ What if they only take one of us?

22:35.939 --> 22:37.107
‐ Where's this coming from?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.693
‐ She said something about

22:42.237 --> 22:44.198
only taking the mothers
and the babies.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.746
She said they might not take you.

22:56.668 --> 23:00.589
‐ I mean, I... I guess, I guess you
and the baby get on the boat,

23:00.589 --> 23:01.465
and I'll‐‐

23:03.467 --> 23:05.260
I'll‐‐ I‐I don't know. I...

23:06.803 --> 23:08.847
I'll just figure something else out, G.

23:11.850 --> 23:12.476
‐ Fuck you.

23:13.602 --> 23:14.353
‐ Wait, what?

23:15.145 --> 23:16.313
‐ That's not what I want to hear.

23:20.234 --> 23:21.235
‐ Okay, Georgia.

23:23.862 --> 23:24.905
What do you want to hear?

23:27.407 --> 23:29.034
‐ I want to hear that
we're in this together.

23:30.202 --> 23:32.079
Th‐that's what I thought
that we were doing.

23:32.079 --> 23:32.955
That‐‐
‐ It is what we're doing.

23:32.955 --> 23:34.581
‐ That we could have just
gotten rid of this,

23:34.581 --> 23:35.582
but we didn't.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.876
And this baby's on its way, Sam.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.837
And you're trying to put me
on a boat by myself

23:39.837 --> 23:42.339
so I'm not your responsibility anymore.
‐ I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying that!

23:43.966 --> 23:45.175
You asked me what I thought.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.887
You're throwing a bunch of what‐ifs at me
and I'm just trying to do the right thing.

23:48.887 --> 23:52.683
‐ What part of putting me
on a boat by myself

23:53.851 --> 23:55.394
is the right thing?

23:55.394 --> 23:57.104
‐ Okay, baby, can you chill?

23:58.230 --> 24:00.983
You're being very hormonal right now.

24:02.568 --> 24:03.318
No, baby‐‐

24:03.819 --> 24:07.197
‐ I am allowed to have emotions!

24:07.197 --> 24:09.032
This is not me being hormonal!

24:14.538 --> 24:16.039
I should have just broken up with you.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.334
‐ Why would you say that?

24:22.296 --> 24:23.130
‐ Forget it.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.564
Where are you going?

24:41.356 --> 24:43.817
‐ I'm gonna go get us a ride.

24:43.817 --> 24:46.695
Don't worry, I'm not abandoning you
or whatever.

25:01.627 --> 25:02.794
Game over!

25:03.837 --> 25:05.255
Game over!

25:06.048 --> 25:07.966
- What time is it?
- Game over.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.259
What time is it?

25:17.893 --> 25:18.894
‐ That's what I'm talking about!

25:18.894 --> 25:20.896
We got a special treat for tonight.

25:21.230 --> 25:23.106
This is no android right here.

25:23.106 --> 25:25.526
I know it looks too good to be true.

25:25.526 --> 25:29.404
This is one hundred percent
USDA prime beef right here.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.991
‐ Yo, man, how can I get
a ride to Boston?

25:34.743 --> 25:36.537
Oh man.

25:38.622 --> 25:40.082
‐ You could fight me for it.

25:40.082 --> 25:42.000
- Ooh!
- Oh, it's on now.

25:46.255 --> 25:47.130
‐ Or are you gonna run?

25:52.261 --> 25:53.887
Oh, he's mad.

25:54.388 --> 25:55.222
Hey!

25:55.222 --> 25:56.056
‐ Where are you going?

25:56.056 --> 25:58.141
‐ Convoy's going up
to Nashua tomorrow.

25:58.684 --> 26:01.228
It'd get you just about as close
as anyone can get.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.397
Yeah.

26:03.397 --> 26:04.940
All you gotta do is‐‐

26:06.275 --> 26:08.193
All you gotta do is

26:08.193 --> 26:09.695
put me flat on my back

26:10.237 --> 26:11.822
and you got yourself a ride.

26:11.822 --> 26:13.198
Ooh!

26:16.159 --> 26:17.494
What's it gonna be, little man?

26:24.877 --> 26:26.545
Ladies! Ladies!

26:26.545 --> 26:27.880
Hey, ladies!

26:27.880 --> 26:28.839
‐ Whoa!

26:28.839 --> 26:30.674
Yeah.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.092
House rules.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.177
No holds barred.

26:33.677 --> 26:35.220
And you rock till you drop.

26:39.808 --> 26:40.851
There you go!

26:43.312 --> 26:44.646
‐ Don't run off now.

26:45.397 --> 26:46.148
Miss.

26:48.567 --> 26:49.401
Miss.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.447
Can you come out here please?

26:55.866 --> 26:56.825
Miss.

26:58.410 --> 26:59.161
‐ Sam?

27:03.332 --> 27:04.374
Where's Sam?

27:13.258 --> 27:14.092
Sir.

27:15.010 --> 27:15.928
Oh yeah.

27:17.721 --> 27:18.514
Sam.

27:19.681 --> 27:20.891
What the fuck
did you do to him?

27:20.891 --> 27:23.101
‐ He was fighting with one
of my patrol officers last night.

27:23.101 --> 27:23.727
‐ What?

27:23.727 --> 27:26.605
‐ Now I got a man with a busted skull
who's going to be blind in one eye.

27:26.605 --> 27:29.024
‐ No. No. I'm‐I'm‐I'm sorry, but that,

27:30.150 --> 27:31.443
that can't be what happened.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.320
‐ You know, I can account
for a certain amount of rowdiness

27:33.320 --> 27:34.446
among the soldiers.

27:34.696 --> 27:37.449
But I will not tolerate
a guest on my base

27:38.283 --> 27:39.493
wailing on my boys.

27:41.286 --> 27:42.663
‐ What are you, what are you going
to do to him?

27:43.330 --> 27:45.249
‐ Lady, I'm fighting
a fucking war here

27:45.249 --> 27:47.417
against an enemy
that literally never sleeps,

27:47.417 --> 27:50.170
whose main objective is to wipe us
off the face of the Earth.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.716
We've got half a platoon,
most of them barely trained.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.970
And I do not need a couple of kids
too chickenshit to enlist

27:57.970 --> 27:59.388
putting any of them
out of commission.

28:00.389 --> 28:01.765
You're no longer welcome
on this base.

28:04.142 --> 28:05.352
‐ Sir, I'm,

28:06.979 --> 28:07.855
I'm, I'm pregnant.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.356
‐ Congratulations.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.650
‐ Sir, I, I don't think you understand.

28:11.650 --> 28:13.861
I have permission from Dr. Howe‐‐

28:14.736 --> 28:16.613
‐ Yes, I've spoken to Dr. Howe.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.032
I've rescinded her request.

28:23.370 --> 28:23.871
‐ Sir‐‐

28:23.871 --> 28:26.039
‐ You got two minutes
to get off my fucking base.

28:28.041 --> 28:28.625
‐ Please.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.627
‐ Now you got one minute

28:30.627 --> 28:33.380
before I signal the other outposts
and tell them not to let you in.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.423
Come on, G, let's go.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.470
Come on, man!
Let's go.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.388
- Come on!
- Keep moving.

28:41.388 --> 28:43.056
DR.Hey.
‐ Hey.

28:43.056 --> 28:45.893
DR.Some painkillers.
Some hydrogen peroxide.

28:46.602 --> 28:47.686
And medical gloves for him.

28:47.686 --> 28:48.979
Get back!
‐ I need my mache‐‐

28:48.979 --> 28:50.981
I've got a machete and a revolver
in there. I came in here with it.

28:50.981 --> 28:52.816
‐ Wish I could do more,
but it's all I can spare.

28:53.525 --> 28:56.195
Cut the umbilical cord close
to your baby and tie it off.

28:56.195 --> 28:57.863
The part that's connected to you
will expel itself

28:57.863 --> 28:59.114
about an hour after you give birth.

29:00.032 --> 29:02.451
Hey, women have been giving birth

29:02.451 --> 29:05.037
since way before people started
calling themselves doctors.

29:05.454 --> 29:06.538
You're gonna do great.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.541
‐ Okay. Thank you.

29:10.042 --> 29:11.293
‐ Good luck.
‐ Yeah.

29:11.293 --> 29:12.377
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

29:14.171 --> 29:16.757
Ma'am, please, please.
I had a revolver as well. I came‐‐

29:16.757 --> 29:18.759
- I don't know anything about it.
- Ma'am, I got a baby on the way.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.135
My pregnant girlfriend. Please.

29:21.178 --> 29:24.264
Look, there are androids out there,
and it's just us. Please.

29:28.185 --> 29:29.019
Thank you.

29:46.703 --> 29:47.621
G!

29:49.623 --> 29:50.624
Georgia!

30:07.766 --> 30:08.809
Georgia.

30:19.236 --> 30:22.114
Look, G, I'm sorry
that I was‐‐

30:23.365 --> 30:26.076
G, I was trying to get us a ride
so that we could go to Boston.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.163
You don't think I can protect you,
but I can.

30:40.507 --> 30:41.258
‐ Protect me?

30:44.970 --> 30:47.097
Asshole. Asshole.

30:47.097 --> 30:50.267
You asshole. You dumb asshole.
Asshole. You fucking asshole!

31:48.992 --> 31:50.369
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.898
‐ When the rain dies down,
I'll try to start a fire.

32:19.898 --> 32:20.941
‐ We can't.

32:21.483 --> 32:22.401
We can't.

32:23.402 --> 32:25.195
We're practically in No Man's Land.

32:29.825 --> 32:31.660
‐ What's going on, baby?
Is it time?

32:32.202 --> 32:33.161
‐ No.

32:34.663 --> 32:35.664
It just hurts.

32:52.806 --> 32:54.266
‐ Hey, Georgia.

32:55.934 --> 32:56.894
G.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.021
Squirrel.

33:00.731 --> 33:01.690
We can’t do this.

33:03.650 --> 33:04.902
We got to get you warm.

33:29.176 --> 33:30.052
Here.

33:34.848 --> 33:36.183
‐ Sam, careful.

33:36.767 --> 33:37.684
‐ It's okay.

34:17.516 --> 34:18.600
‐ Come on.

34:21.103 --> 34:22.187
Come on.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.510
‐ Look, G, I didn't find
a towel, but‐‐

34:53.969 --> 34:54.761
‐ Thank you.

34:57.723 --> 34:58.849
Uh‐uh.

34:58.849 --> 35:01.685
We are not having sex tonight,
so don't you dare look at me‐‐

35:01.685 --> 35:03.228
‐ I didn't even say anything.

35:03.228 --> 35:05.189
‐ I'm still so mad at you
for being so dumb.

35:07.232 --> 35:08.525
It was so fucking dumb, Sam.

35:08.525 --> 35:10.277
‐ I know. I know.

35:23.916 --> 35:25.417
‐ I'm sorry for saying what I said.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.214
I don't know. I was just being‐‐

35:31.089 --> 35:32.007
‐ Hormonal.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.302
‐ Watch it.

35:36.386 --> 35:37.304
Thin ice.

35:38.055 --> 35:39.556
Ugh! Please tell me

35:39.973 --> 35:42.768
there's a mattress somewhere
in this house I can sleep on.

35:42.768 --> 35:45.020
My spine feels like
it's gonna shatter.

36:04.498 --> 36:05.749
Anything good yet?

36:08.043 --> 36:08.961
‐ No.

36:52.171 --> 36:53.964
‐ Oh.

36:53.964 --> 36:55.841
Do you want me to help you?
SAM Take this.

36:55.841 --> 36:57.050
‐ Huh?
‐ Take this out of my mouth.

36:57.050 --> 36:58.260
‐ What?
‐ Just take it!

37:01.221 --> 37:02.472
Ow. Okay.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.058
So, good news.

37:05.976 --> 37:08.979
This camera has one more photo in it.

37:09.980 --> 37:13.025
Which means... sometime soon,

37:14.234 --> 37:16.528
you... and me

37:18.614 --> 37:19.990
and Spruce

37:22.284 --> 37:25.996
can have an actual
real‐life family photo.

37:31.418 --> 37:33.629
‐ We are not naming our baby Spruce.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.972
Everything we've heard about Boston
is that it's surrounded.

37:47.809 --> 37:49.061
So, we'd have to go up north.

37:51.563 --> 37:52.564
Way north.

37:53.690 --> 37:54.942
Maybe New Hampshire,

37:56.985 --> 37:57.819
Portsmouth.

37:58.862 --> 38:01.532
And then we'd have
to find a boat or something

38:01.532 --> 38:03.575
to bring us back down
into Boston harbor.

38:04.576 --> 38:05.619
‐ How long would that take?

38:07.204 --> 38:08.830
‐ Two weeks maybe.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.416
And then there's the boat stuff which

38:13.460 --> 38:14.753
I don't know how to figure that out.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.422
‐ And how long
to cut straight through?

38:18.924 --> 38:20.342
‐ It's 20 miles, so...

38:22.177 --> 38:23.011
two days.

38:24.471 --> 38:25.889
Probably three or four.

38:30.185 --> 38:31.395
‐ Twenty miles.

38:33.272 --> 38:34.273
No checkpoints.

38:37.150 --> 38:38.402
No EMPs.

38:39.903 --> 38:41.071
Maybe no humans.

38:42.656 --> 38:43.991
Lot of androids.

38:48.370 --> 38:49.538
We'd have to be quiet.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.251
‐ Silent.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.255
We would have to be silent.

39:04.678 --> 39:06.138
We should have the baby here.

39:16.064 --> 39:17.566
‐ That really scares me, G.

39:20.903 --> 39:21.987
‐ Me too.

39:25.741 --> 39:26.992
‐ What if something goes wrong?

39:29.453 --> 39:30.829
‐ That doctor was right, Sam.

39:34.249 --> 39:37.044
They make such a big deal
about giving birth, but

39:38.754 --> 39:41.465
women used to... give birth

39:41.465 --> 39:44.927
and then... I don't know,
cut the umbilical cord with their teeth

39:44.927 --> 39:46.386
and keep on hunting.

39:49.139 --> 39:51.016
‐ Oh, what, so you're a hunter now?

39:52.059 --> 39:53.310
Huh?

39:53.936 --> 39:55.229
‐ You know what I mean.

39:58.815 --> 40:01.235
Once the baby's here,
we could just take our time.

40:03.237 --> 40:05.280
Take the long way. It's dry here.

40:06.156 --> 40:07.324
We have supplies.

40:09.201 --> 40:12.037
We've been lugging
that medical dictionary around

40:12.037 --> 40:14.456
for... six months now.

40:17.334 --> 40:18.460
Why don't we just stop?

40:27.261 --> 40:28.971
‐ You think it’ll ever go back to normal?

40:32.140 --> 40:33.016
‐ No.

40:35.644 --> 40:37.187
I mean, I don't even know
if it should.

40:41.984 --> 40:45.028
But I do think it...
could be good still.

40:48.407 --> 40:49.324
Someday.

41:38.415 --> 41:39.541
Oh my god.

41:55.682 --> 41:56.558
Hey.

42:01.104 --> 42:02.856
‐ I got it to turn over
a second ago.

42:04.066 --> 42:04.900
Did it wake you up?

42:04.900 --> 42:05.859
‐ No.

42:07.736 --> 42:08.529
Um‐‐

42:09.321 --> 42:10.906
‐ Take it you saw
the mass grave, huh?

42:15.661 --> 42:18.705
It looked... dug up.

42:19.706 --> 42:20.999
‐ Animals, I think.

42:23.669 --> 42:24.378
‐ What are you doing?

42:25.671 --> 42:26.505
‐ Fixing this.

42:27.714 --> 42:29.007
‐ Yeah, but why?

42:29.883 --> 42:30.717
We can't take it.

42:31.510 --> 42:32.135
‐ Why not?

42:33.679 --> 42:35.597
‐ 'Cause it will attract
too much attention.

42:37.057 --> 42:38.642
We'll just go on foot
once the baby's here.

42:38.642 --> 42:41.687
‐ Look, G, I know
you're not gonna like this,

42:42.729 --> 42:44.273
but I need you to hear me out.

42:44.648 --> 42:45.607
I'm trying to be smart.

42:51.405 --> 42:52.823
You could have this baby today

42:53.574 --> 42:54.783
o‐or in a week.

42:55.826 --> 42:58.412
And I don't feel good about waiting
on the edge of No Man's Land

42:58.412 --> 42:59.913
hoping no one finds us.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.334
‐ You wanna go straight through.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.253
‐ It's 20 miles.

43:06.837 --> 43:08.255
And if we take this bike,

43:08.255 --> 43:09.840
we can get there
by the end of the day.

43:13.093 --> 43:16.346
‐ What... happened
to going quietly, Sam?

43:17.514 --> 43:18.849
What changed since last night?

43:20.934 --> 43:21.977
‐ Okay, G.

43:23.437 --> 43:24.688
Let's say you have the baby,

43:25.606 --> 43:27.608
and we pull off the homebirth
by ourselves.

43:28.734 --> 43:29.818
Then we have a baby

43:30.903 --> 43:32.613
who screams when he's hungry

43:33.405 --> 43:34.489
or when it's cold.

43:35.657 --> 43:37.117
We've been sneaking around so far,

43:38.493 --> 43:39.995
but we're not going to be able
to do that anymore.

43:40.829 --> 43:44.166
Let's say we can stay quiet enough
to make it up to New Hampshire.

43:44.166 --> 43:46.543
What kind of boat are we gonna get?
A motorboat?

43:47.461 --> 43:49.796
Or gas or a sailboat?

43:51.131 --> 43:52.341
I don't know how to sail, G.

43:53.258 --> 43:53.717
Do you?

43:55.260 --> 43:56.512
That's scary to me.

44:08.857 --> 44:09.816
Look, G.

44:10.901 --> 44:12.861
I see a way that we can do this.

44:12.861 --> 44:14.279
A way to make it okay.

44:18.367 --> 44:19.952
G, I know you think
I can't protect you,

44:19.952 --> 44:21.328
but I would kill for you.

44:21.328 --> 44:23.330
‐ Sam‐‐
‐ I would die for you.

44:25.457 --> 44:27.042
And I would do the same for our baby.

44:30.212 --> 44:31.505
So, please, G.

44:32.005 --> 44:32.923
Please.

44:33.423 --> 44:34.967
Let me just fix this bike

44:35.717 --> 44:37.845
so we can get the hell out
of this dumb situation.

44:38.971 --> 44:39.888
Today.

44:41.723 --> 44:42.766
Today, G.

44:49.022 --> 44:49.940
‐ Okay.

46:03.055 --> 46:04.056
‐ Watch our backs.

47:07.911 --> 47:08.871
‐ You good, G?

47:09.580 --> 47:10.831
‐ Just my feet.

47:10.831 --> 47:11.957
‐ Mm‐hmm.

47:12.666 --> 47:14.710
Bet you want some All Stars now,
don't you?

48:23.403 --> 48:23.987
‐ Sam.

48:30.619 --> 48:32.454
‐ Get your shit, G.
Let's go.

48:34.289 --> 48:36.333
‐ Go! Go!

48:39.503 --> 48:40.671
Start!
‐ Go!

48:40.671 --> 48:41.797
‐ Hop on, G, come on!

48:51.265 --> 48:53.100
Did we lose him?
‐ Hold on.

48:53.100 --> 48:54.935
‐ G, did we lose him?
‐ Okay, I think we lost him.

48:54.935 --> 48:55.727
‐ Oh shit!

49:00.399 --> 49:01.275
G, grab the gun!

49:09.491 --> 49:10.951
‐ Keep it straight.
‐ Georgia.

49:10.951 --> 49:11.994
Keep it straight!

49:11.994 --> 49:13.245
‐ Georgia!
‐ Keep it straight!

49:13.871 --> 49:14.872
‐ Georgia!

49:16.456 --> 49:16.999
‐ I got her.

49:22.629 --> 49:23.630
‐ G, you need to stop?

49:25.674 --> 49:26.758
‐ Don't stop!

49:27.509 --> 49:28.427
Fuck, G!

49:28.427 --> 49:29.803
Come on. Go, go, go!
Don't stop!

49:29.803 --> 49:30.512
‐ Oh shit.

49:30.512 --> 49:31.680
Don't slow down!

50:07.299 --> 50:07.883
‐ Fuck!

50:28.820 --> 50:29.321
Go!

50:47.923 --> 50:48.549
Sam.

50:50.843 --> 50:52.010
Sam, we can't outrun them.

51:10.904 --> 51:12.155
You need to get off!
‐ What?

51:12.155 --> 51:13.407
‐ Give me the gun.
I'm gonna distract them.

51:13.407 --> 51:14.867
‐ Sam!
‐ Georgia, listen to me.

51:14.867 --> 51:17.286
This is the only shot we've got.
If they chase after me, you can get away.

51:17.286 --> 51:18.245
‐ No!
‐ Go back to the river.

51:18.245 --> 51:19.538
I'll meet you there.
I can outrun them.

51:19.538 --> 51:20.289
‐ Sam!

51:21.373 --> 51:22.833
Sam! Sam!

51:25.544 --> 51:26.378
Ah!

52:16.887 --> 52:18.013
Run, G!

52:56.510 --> 52:57.678
‐ They won't stop.

52:59.221 --> 53:01.348
If you don't want them to catch you,
come with me now.

53:02.641 --> 53:03.267
‐ My boyfriend‐‐

53:03.267 --> 53:04.142
‐ They've taken him.

53:04.476 --> 53:05.102
‐ Where?

53:05.102 --> 53:06.436
‐ I can help you, but you have
to come with me.

53:22.286 --> 53:23.036
Let me help you.

53:26.498 --> 53:27.416
Please.

53:48.645 --> 53:49.521
‐ Where are we going?

53:49.521 --> 53:50.939
‐ Shh.

53:52.149 --> 53:53.233
They're everywhere.

54:10.959 --> 54:11.752
It's okay.

54:13.754 --> 54:14.630
Come on.

54:45.661 --> 54:46.912
‐ Is it safe to speak here?

54:57.422 --> 54:58.757
You did all of this?

55:02.469 --> 55:03.971
How have they
not found this place?

55:06.473 --> 55:07.391
Or you?

55:10.060 --> 55:10.769
Hey!

55:12.938 --> 55:13.981
Who are you?

55:18.652 --> 55:20.195
‐ You ever hear of Karel Capek?

55:21.780 --> 55:22.656
‐ Is that you?

55:23.448 --> 55:24.283
‐ No.

55:25.492 --> 55:26.535
He was a writer.

55:27.536 --> 55:28.287
Czech.

55:29.621 --> 55:31.331
In 1920, he wrote a play.

55:32.499 --> 55:34.835
Rossumovi Univerzalni Roboti.

55:37.337 --> 55:38.964
‐ And what does that have
to do with anything?

55:39.464 --> 55:41.091
‐ In it, a man,

55:41.508 --> 55:42.676
scientist,

55:43.510 --> 55:45.012
tries to create new life.

55:46.388 --> 55:47.681
Prove that there was no god.

55:50.142 --> 55:52.352
His creations, the Roboti,

55:52.936 --> 55:56.523
were these artificial creatures
with living flesh and blood components.

55:57.983 --> 55:59.943
Essentially what
the modern android is.

56:01.278 --> 56:02.112
They look like us.

56:02.821 --> 56:03.906
They talk like us.

56:04.781 --> 56:07.743
And it's commonplace to mistake
a Roboti for a human.

56:08.827 --> 56:09.786
And at first,

56:10.412 --> 56:11.997
they seemed happy to serve man.

56:13.332 --> 56:14.291
But in the end,

56:15.417 --> 56:18.295
a Roboti rebellion leads
to the extinction of human life.

56:20.839 --> 56:22.382
This play

56:23.342 --> 56:25.761
introduced the word Robot
to human language

56:27.596 --> 56:28.847
and it ends with our extinction.

56:30.516 --> 56:32.976
We knew what was coming
the second we gave it a name.

56:33.977 --> 56:35.187
But sure, let's build

56:35.687 --> 56:38.732
million dollar butlers and assume
it's all going to be okay.

56:42.402 --> 56:43.862
So fucking arrogant.

56:52.788 --> 56:53.997
‐ What did you do there?

56:54.665 --> 56:55.999
‐ AI programmer.

56:59.211 --> 57:00.671
I'm alive because I know
how they think.

57:04.550 --> 57:05.717
‐ What happened that night,

57:05.717 --> 57:07.219
the night of the Blitz?

57:07.636 --> 57:10.055
They were supposed
to be programmed not to kill us.

57:11.807 --> 57:12.558
What went wrong?

57:14.601 --> 57:15.978
‐ What went wrong

57:16.937 --> 57:19.106
was we built them in the first place.

57:23.944 --> 57:25.571
I need to sleep.
‐ Wait.

57:29.575 --> 57:30.617
What's your name?

57:33.161 --> 57:34.162
‐ Arthur.

57:56.685 --> 57:57.519
‐ Thank you.

58:27.799 --> 58:28.550
‐ What's wrong with you?

58:33.639 --> 58:35.057
‐ I'm having contractions.

58:36.683 --> 58:37.726
‐ Has your water broken?

58:41.021 --> 58:42.022
‐ No.

58:45.067 --> 58:45.984
Sam.

58:47.486 --> 58:48.362
I gotta find Sam.

58:53.742 --> 58:54.535
Ah.

58:55.536 --> 58:57.037
‐ You need to forget about your friend.

59:02.209 --> 59:03.627
‐ He's not my friend.

59:04.670 --> 59:05.504
He's‐‐

59:08.215 --> 59:09.341
He's the father.

59:12.302 --> 59:12.761
‐ Look,

59:14.471 --> 59:15.973
I'm sorry for what
you're going through.

59:17.432 --> 59:18.642
I know it's not easy.

59:20.853 --> 59:22.354
But you need to get
with the program here.

59:23.939 --> 59:25.315
They're not butlers anymore.

59:26.316 --> 59:27.609
They're killing machines.

59:28.277 --> 59:30.279
And they've jumped
the evolutionary chain.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.866
They've hacked our programming,
and they'll use it against us

59:33.866 --> 59:34.867
until we're all dead.

59:35.325 --> 59:38.120
‐ Hacked our... programming,
what do you mean?

59:40.247 --> 59:42.958
We're not robots.
You can't hack us.

59:45.002 --> 59:46.003
‐ Love.

59:47.671 --> 59:49.715
I know it sounds dumb,
but that's what it is.

59:51.133 --> 59:55.095
Human beings are programmed
through hormones and primal urges

59:56.263 --> 59:57.514
to have emotional connections.

59:58.765 --> 1:00:00.767
It's what kept us alive this long.

1:00:01.476 --> 1:00:04.479
Parents, spouses, children.

1:00:06.607 --> 1:00:08.025
But an android doesn't have that.

1:00:09.109 --> 1:00:10.527
An android is expendable.

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:14.740
They don't have self‐preservation,
and they'll sacrifice themselves

1:00:14.740 --> 1:00:15.657
and others

1:00:16.283 --> 1:00:17.951
if it brings them closer
to their goal.

1:00:19.119 --> 1:00:20.704
They can reason
past sentiment

1:00:21.163 --> 1:00:22.331
and emotional bond.

1:00:24.208 --> 1:00:25.209
It's love.

1:00:27.753 --> 1:00:29.254
Love makes us selfish.

1:00:31.632 --> 1:00:32.925
Love will kill us all.

1:00:38.722 --> 1:00:40.432
‐ I‐I can't leave him to die.

1:00:48.857 --> 1:00:49.775
‐ You want to live?

1:00:51.109 --> 1:00:52.152
‐ Of course.

1:00:58.116 --> 1:00:59.076
‐ Save yourself.

1:01:00.786 --> 1:01:01.954
That's what they would do.

1:01:02.871 --> 1:01:04.748
They have strategy like
you wouldn't believe.

1:01:06.333 --> 1:01:07.167
Please.

1:01:08.544 --> 1:01:09.461
Please.

1:01:10.462 --> 1:01:11.797
Just listen to me.

1:01:13.715 --> 1:01:15.300
‐ Why do you care so much?

1:01:24.726 --> 1:01:25.686
‐ Can I?

1:02:03.932 --> 1:02:04.725
‐ Hey.

1:02:06.518 --> 1:02:07.352
Hey.

1:02:11.773 --> 1:02:13.150
Shh. Shh.

1:02:13.150 --> 1:02:14.610
‐ They're all dead.
‐ I know.

1:02:14.985 --> 1:02:16.320
‐ They're all dead.
‐ I know.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:17.988
‐ They're all dead.

1:02:18.822 --> 1:02:20.240
They're all dead.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:21.116
‐ I know.

1:02:23.410 --> 1:02:24.328
It's okay.

1:02:25.954 --> 1:02:27.039
Hey, it's okay.

1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:28.999
Shh.

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:30.918
I'm sorry.

1:02:42.471 --> 1:02:43.388
‐ I'm sorry.

1:02:46.391 --> 1:02:47.851
You were headed
to Boston, right?

1:02:50.687 --> 1:02:51.813
I can take you.

1:02:53.357 --> 1:02:55.234
I can get you there.
I can get you there safe.

1:02:55.567 --> 1:02:56.610
‐ How?

1:02:58.862 --> 1:02:59.696
‐ This.

1:03:03.408 --> 1:03:06.620
About eight years ago, we started
developing camouflage algorithms

1:03:06.620 --> 1:03:08.330
for our complex
in Eastern Europe.

1:03:09.289 --> 1:03:11.375
Androids see UV,

1:03:11.375 --> 1:03:13.585
heat sensors, night vision.

1:03:13.585 --> 1:03:17.464
But this algorithm created a mask
against all of that.

1:03:17.798 --> 1:03:19.091
That makes you invisible?

1:03:19.091 --> 1:03:20.050
To the eye.

1:03:20.509 --> 1:03:21.552
But they can hear you.

1:03:21.552 --> 1:03:23.762
They can smell you.
They're not stupid.

1:03:24.221 --> 1:03:26.056
They know this tech exists,
so they look for you.

1:03:28.392 --> 1:03:29.309
But it gives us a shot.

1:03:34.857 --> 1:03:36.441
‐ I'm not leaving without Sam.

1:03:38.235 --> 1:03:38.777
This...

1:03:40.988 --> 1:03:43.448
camouflage or whatever
you want to call it,

1:03:43.448 --> 1:03:44.616
it gives me a chance.

1:03:46.034 --> 1:03:47.327
To go and get him.

1:03:48.704 --> 1:03:50.247
‐ I'm not letting you take
my armor for that.

1:03:52.624 --> 1:03:54.668
‐ Fine. Then keep it.

1:03:55.627 --> 1:03:57.504
It doesn't matter either way.
I'm gonna go get him.

1:03:58.755 --> 1:03:59.756
‐ You can die.

1:04:06.889 --> 1:04:08.265
I really did try to help you.

1:04:09.391 --> 1:04:10.559
I hope you remember that.

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:24.615
Let's go.

1:04:57.314 --> 1:04:58.232
No! No! No!

1:05:02.569 --> 1:05:04.196
Please, just let me go.

1:05:11.745 --> 1:05:14.665
Ah! No! Please. No, no!

1:05:26.885 --> 1:05:27.845
See the movement?

1:05:29.096 --> 1:05:29.972
Yeah.

1:05:29.972 --> 1:05:30.806
‐ Patrols.

1:05:36.937 --> 1:05:38.146
‐ What are they doing to them?

1:05:39.147 --> 1:05:40.482
‐ Using them as bait.

1:05:40.482 --> 1:05:41.525
‐ For who?

1:05:43.151 --> 1:05:44.111
‐ For you.

1:05:45.195 --> 1:05:47.531
He won't be the only one
they've captured.

1:05:51.618 --> 1:05:52.870
‐ You're not coming with me?

1:05:54.079 --> 1:05:55.289
‐ I only have two.

1:05:56.248 --> 1:05:58.166
You're gonna need one for him
if you want to get him out of there.

1:06:04.131 --> 1:06:05.591
‐ Are you sure this thing works?

1:06:08.802 --> 1:06:10.762
‐ Yeah. Why wouldn't it?

1:06:13.974 --> 1:06:15.642
You find him and you put this on him.

1:06:18.353 --> 1:06:20.105
Get him out of there
and you do it silently.

1:06:21.815 --> 1:06:23.442
They're going to notice he's disappeared.

1:06:23.984 --> 1:06:26.361
You have four miles till you get
to the edge of No Man's Land.

1:06:26.945 --> 1:06:29.698
They won't stop until they detect
the EMP radius signal.

1:06:30.199 --> 1:06:30.949
Understand?

1:06:33.327 --> 1:06:34.494
Or you could just walk away.

1:06:36.622 --> 1:06:37.998
You could walk away right now.

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:40.459
He would never know.

1:06:46.089 --> 1:06:46.924
‐ I'd know.

1:08:06.253 --> 1:08:09.006
Let me out! Let me out!

1:10:40.490 --> 1:10:41.491
Okay.

1:10:54.546 --> 1:10:56.590
Sam. Sam.

1:11:00.511 --> 1:11:01.553
G‐‐

1:11:02.095 --> 1:11:03.263
‐ What did they do to you?

1:11:03.639 --> 1:11:05.057
‐ G, get out of here.

1:11:05.057 --> 1:11:06.225
Hey!
‐ I'm here now.

1:11:06.225 --> 1:11:07.518
Hey!

1:11:07.518 --> 1:11:08.894
‐ Shh.
Please help me out.

1:11:09.478 --> 1:11:10.812
‐ Stop it. Be quiet.

1:11:10.812 --> 1:11:12.731
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

1:11:12.731 --> 1:11:14.483
They're in there. Please.
Be quiet.

1:11:14.483 --> 1:11:16.568
Stop it. Be quiet.
Please be quiet.

1:11:16.902 --> 1:11:18.070
Be quiet.
‐ I can help you.

1:11:18.070 --> 1:11:19.696
‐ I can help you. Just let me out.
‐ Wait. Stop it.

1:11:19.988 --> 1:11:21.406
Please be quiet. Please.

1:11:29.623 --> 1:11:30.582
Hey.

1:11:31.041 --> 1:11:32.960
Hey, come here,
you fucking piece of shit!

1:11:33.418 --> 1:11:34.461
Come here!

1:11:35.003 --> 1:11:36.255
Come here, you fucking‐‐

1:11:57.985 --> 1:11:59.111
‐ Sam. Wait.

1:11:59.111 --> 1:11:59.987
Hey!

1:12:00.529 --> 1:12:02.823
Hey! Hey, come on.
Just help me out.

1:12:03.282 --> 1:12:04.241
I can help you.

1:12:05.033 --> 1:12:06.243
Bitch!
‐ Put this on.

1:12:06.243 --> 1:12:07.244
Bitch!
‐ Put this on.

1:12:07.244 --> 1:12:10.122
‐ If you don't fucking help me,
I'm gonna scream.

1:12:10.122 --> 1:12:12.958
And every single one of those
motherfuckers is gonna come in here.

1:12:12.958 --> 1:12:14.042
‐ Let's go.

1:12:14.042 --> 1:12:15.419
Hey!

1:12:15.419 --> 1:12:17.504
Stop it!
‐ Hey!

1:12:18.172 --> 1:12:19.256
Hey! Come on!

1:12:20.090 --> 1:12:22.634
Hey! Get me out of here. Come on!

1:12:49.870 --> 1:12:51.955
No. It's happening.

1:12:59.546 --> 1:13:00.380
‐ We have to move.

1:13:22.611 --> 1:13:23.111
Sam.

1:14:32.556 --> 1:14:33.640
Try not to move.

1:14:38.312 --> 1:14:39.688
‐ Ow! Where am I?

1:14:40.230 --> 1:14:41.023
Boston.

1:14:51.366 --> 1:14:52.492
‐ Where's Sam?

1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:54.161
‐ He's right there.

1:14:58.081 --> 1:14:59.166
‐ Hi, Squirrel.

1:15:01.126 --> 1:15:02.002
‐ Hey.

1:15:04.630 --> 1:15:07.799
He's been through a lot,
but before we talk about Sam

1:15:07.799 --> 1:15:09.676
I think we should talk about this...

1:15:12.638 --> 1:15:14.431
healthy baby boy.

1:15:18.936 --> 1:15:19.937
‐ I told you.

1:15:25.567 --> 1:15:26.318
‐ Hey.

1:15:31.031 --> 1:15:32.115
Hi, baby.

1:15:34.409 --> 1:15:35.953
Your friend has been resting.

1:15:36.453 --> 1:15:38.038
He collapsed after getting you here.

1:15:38.330 --> 1:15:40.040
They're gonna want to talk to him
when he wakes up.

1:15:43.710 --> 1:15:44.962
How did we get here?

1:15:45.587 --> 1:15:47.005
He got you
through the checkpoint.

1:15:47.589 --> 1:15:49.758
Caused quite a fuss
with the soldiers.

1:15:50.759 --> 1:15:54.638
But when they saw you were midway
through delivery and unconscious,

1:15:54.638 --> 1:15:56.849
we got you in here
and performed a C‐section.

1:15:58.308 --> 1:15:59.184
‐ Thank you.

1:16:01.436 --> 1:16:04.648
It's a nice change
having some life here.

1:16:07.067 --> 1:16:08.944
Some base personnel are going
to be coming by

1:16:08.944 --> 1:16:11.738
to ask a few questions,
security related.

1:16:11.738 --> 1:16:13.365
I told them that you need your rest,

1:16:13.365 --> 1:16:15.117
but they just need
to clear some things up.

1:16:21.290 --> 1:16:22.583
Excuse me. I‐‐

1:16:25.043 --> 1:16:26.879
The base nurse
should be in here.

1:16:27.254 --> 1:16:28.213
Hey, love.

1:16:34.469 --> 1:16:36.346
Yeah. Let's go say hi
to daddy.

1:16:38.682 --> 1:16:39.641
Oh.

1:16:40.767 --> 1:16:42.269
Come here.
Give me your little hands.

1:16:49.651 --> 1:16:50.736
Hi.

1:16:51.195 --> 1:16:52.613
You want to say hi
to Daddy?

1:16:55.407 --> 1:16:56.992
Oh, little man.

1:17:07.336 --> 1:17:08.837
Waiting for you, buddy.

1:17:11.965 --> 1:17:13.550
I think we can all agree

1:17:14.885 --> 1:17:16.970
that in hindsight,

1:17:18.180 --> 1:17:21.016
my plan to get us here
was a stunning success.

1:17:24.561 --> 1:17:25.979
‐ We're a wreck,

1:17:27.981 --> 1:17:29.316
but we did it.

1:17:31.527 --> 1:17:33.612
‐ You haven't even seen
the worst part yet, G.

1:17:37.991 --> 1:17:40.869
Okay, this is really not a funny way
to tell you this, but‐‐

1:17:56.802 --> 1:17:58.136
‐ Oh, Sam.

1:17:58.136 --> 1:17:59.179
‐ It's alright.

1:18:00.639 --> 1:18:02.057
‐ Why'd they do this to you?

1:18:03.517 --> 1:18:05.060
‐ I was all smashed up.

1:18:06.311 --> 1:18:07.771
It was the best they could do.

1:18:09.106 --> 1:18:11.275
They said we'd know in a few days
if I'm going to be okay,

1:18:11.275 --> 1:18:14.069
but... I just got
to take it easy for now.

1:18:15.821 --> 1:18:19.408
But... soon as we get to Korea,

1:18:20.534 --> 1:18:22.995
I'm for sure getting
some of those robot feet.

1:18:25.038 --> 1:18:26.999
'Cause that definitely sounds safe.

1:18:34.047 --> 1:18:35.132
Shh.

1:18:35.799 --> 1:18:36.800
‐ Why are you so good?

1:18:39.553 --> 1:18:41.972
‐ Because it's what dads
are supposed to be.

1:18:49.563 --> 1:18:50.480
Okay.

1:18:51.565 --> 1:18:52.608
Forest.

1:18:53.609 --> 1:18:54.484
Huh?

1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:56.278
‐ Forest.

1:18:58.739 --> 1:18:59.448
‐ Yeah.

1:19:01.909 --> 1:19:03.619
He feels like Forest to me.

1:19:08.790 --> 1:19:10.250
‐ What's your name?
‐ Georgia.

1:19:11.251 --> 1:19:12.044
Olsen.

1:19:12.419 --> 1:19:13.295
‐ And his name?

1:19:14.129 --> 1:19:15.005
‐ Sam.

1:19:15.756 --> 1:19:16.840
Samuel Hoth.

1:19:17.424 --> 1:19:18.842
‐ And the guy who brought you here?

1:19:21.428 --> 1:19:22.471
Arthur. I don't‐‐

1:19:23.639 --> 1:19:24.806
I don't know his last name.

1:19:25.098 --> 1:19:27.476
- So you came from?
- Central Mass.

1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:29.061
Near the Quabbin.

1:19:32.022 --> 1:19:33.065
We, uh,

1:19:33.899 --> 1:19:36.527
we ended up making it to Philly

1:19:36.527 --> 1:19:38.070
before we looped back up.

1:19:38.403 --> 1:19:40.989
We were trying to get out of the country
with The Family Initiative.

1:19:42.491 --> 1:19:45.786
We heard that they were still getting
people out of Boston. Is that true?

1:19:45.786 --> 1:19:46.703
‐ Yeah. They are.

1:19:52.709 --> 1:19:55.379
‐ Can I speak with you about‐‐

1:19:55.379 --> 1:19:56.171
‐ Oh, we're not done.

1:19:59.091 --> 1:19:59.883
‐ Okay.

1:19:59.883 --> 1:20:02.094
‐ So how'd you meet the guy, Arthur?

1:20:02.845 --> 1:20:04.680
‐ Well, I guess I'll start with the‐‐

1:20:05.973 --> 1:20:08.058
We had to get across
the No Man's Land.

1:20:09.393 --> 1:20:11.979
And we didn't want to risk
giving birth there.

1:20:11.979 --> 1:20:15.065
So... we found this dirt bike
and we decided

1:20:15.065 --> 1:20:16.358
to use that to get across

1:20:16.358 --> 1:20:20.863
and we only got halfway
before we ran into some androids.

1:20:21.697 --> 1:20:23.156
They separated us.

1:20:24.449 --> 1:20:27.744
I hid, but they, they took Sam.

1:20:27.744 --> 1:20:29.580
‐ They took him? For what?

1:20:29.580 --> 1:20:30.581
‐ I don't know.

1:20:31.623 --> 1:20:32.583
I mean, they just,

1:20:33.834 --> 1:20:34.835
they took him.

1:20:36.003 --> 1:20:37.379
They held him prisoner.
They had a,

1:20:38.213 --> 1:20:39.673
a house full of prisoners.

1:20:47.014 --> 1:20:49.057
‐ So, how'd you meet this guy, Arthur?

1:20:49.975 --> 1:20:52.728
‐ He was in th‐the woods
when it happened. He‐‐

1:20:54.062 --> 1:20:54.771
He saved me.

1:20:54.771 --> 1:20:55.606
‐ How?

1:20:56.398 --> 1:20:58.901
He took me back to his truck. And he‐‐

1:20:59.985 --> 1:21:01.528
Well, he helped me

1:21:02.654 --> 1:21:04.239
figure out a way
to get Sam out of the house

1:21:04.239 --> 1:21:05.032
and so I,

1:21:07.034 --> 1:21:07.993
I went in and I got him.

1:21:08.744 --> 1:21:10.537
‐ You just walked in?

1:21:13.498 --> 1:21:16.001
‐ I mean, you probably saw it
on the truck already. But he‐‐

1:21:17.044 --> 1:21:21.298
Uh, he used to work
at... Raster Robotics.

1:21:24.301 --> 1:21:25.177
‐ He told you that?

1:21:25.552 --> 1:21:26.637
‐ Yes.

1:21:28.430 --> 1:21:29.681
So he, he was a,

1:21:30.933 --> 1:21:33.769
um, a programmer
and he built this,

1:21:35.562 --> 1:21:37.397
this armor, um, that

1:21:38.941 --> 1:21:41.276
camouflages you
from the androids.

1:21:43.695 --> 1:21:44.905
It makes you invisible to them.

1:21:46.448 --> 1:21:47.407
‐ What?

1:21:48.408 --> 1:21:51.745
‐ You put it on, and it makes you
invisible to the androids.

1:21:53.330 --> 1:21:54.915
‐ He told you
it makes you invisible?

1:21:57.251 --> 1:21:58.961
‐ He didn't‐‐
he didn't just tell me.

1:22:00.212 --> 1:22:01.171
I used it.

1:22:02.297 --> 1:22:03.757
I went in, and I, and I,

1:22:03.757 --> 1:22:05.592
and I went into the house
and I wore it,

1:22:07.928 --> 1:22:08.887
and they couldn't see me.

1:22:09.263 --> 1:22:10.180
‐ What?

1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:12.099
‐ What?

1:22:12.099 --> 1:22:14.852
‐ You just walked into the house,
and they couldn't see you?

1:22:17.020 --> 1:22:17.688
‐ Yes.

1:22:17.688 --> 1:22:19.398
‐ That technology doesn't exist.

1:22:28.282 --> 1:22:30.242
‐ Okay. Well,

1:22:32.786 --> 1:22:35.330
I'm telling you that it does
because I wore it, and it worked.

1:22:35.330 --> 1:22:38.041
‐ And I'm telling you if that existed,
don't you think we'd be using it?

1:22:38.750 --> 1:22:41.753
So you need to start straightening
this story out so it starts making sense.

1:22:42.754 --> 1:22:45.215
What... happened out there?

1:22:47.009 --> 1:22:49.803
Human beings are programmed
to have emotional connections.

1:22:50.762 --> 1:22:53.765
Parents, spouses, children.

1:22:53.765 --> 1:22:56.185
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1:22:56.185 --> 1:22:57.352
They're all dead.

1:22:58.520 --> 1:22:59.980
An android is expendable.

1:23:00.898 --> 1:23:03.859
They don't have self ‐ preservation,
and they'll sacrifice themselves

1:23:03.859 --> 1:23:06.403
and others if it brings them
closer to their goal.

1:23:09.239 --> 1:23:11.158
They have strategy
like you wouldn't believe.

1:23:15.954 --> 1:23:17.497
‐ I think I made a mistake.

1:23:43.482 --> 1:23:44.233
Wait here.

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.460
‐ It's okay. It's okay.

1:24:05.087 --> 1:24:06.129
Sam, get up!

1:24:07.047 --> 1:24:08.131
Sam, get up!

1:24:24.690 --> 1:24:26.441
Come on. Sam!

1:24:26.692 --> 1:24:27.526
You gotta wake up.

1:24:33.282 --> 1:24:34.324
EMP.

1:24:35.701 --> 1:24:37.327
He's going to disable the EMP.

1:24:46.461 --> 1:24:48.213
I'm gonna come back. I promise.

1:25:08.483 --> 1:25:09.568
Go, go, go, go!

1:25:09.568 --> 1:25:11.278
Breach! Breach!

1:25:11.945 --> 1:25:13.197
Swarm 8s!

1:25:22.623 --> 1:25:23.582
On your left!

1:25:55.948 --> 1:25:58.700
‐ It's okay. Don't cry.
Be quiet. Mama's here.

1:25:59.660 --> 1:26:00.494
Please be quiet.

1:26:13.549 --> 1:26:14.466
Yes!

1:26:19.972 --> 1:26:21.014
I warned you.

1:26:24.226 --> 1:26:25.644
What are you gonna do
with that?

1:26:29.857 --> 1:26:30.983
They're all dead.

1:26:32.526 --> 1:26:33.610
They're all dead.

1:26:34.862 --> 1:26:36.238
They're all dead.

1:26:36.864 --> 1:26:38.448
They're all dead.

1:26:38.448 --> 1:26:40.784
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1:26:40.951 --> 1:26:42.911
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1:26:43.161 --> 1:26:45.247
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1:26:57.009 --> 1:26:59.636
We were programmed to be emotive
to make you feel comfort.

1:27:01.638 --> 1:27:02.389
Are you comfortable?

1:27:04.308 --> 1:27:06.059
Boston's going down today.

1:27:06.518 --> 1:27:07.769
You can't stop us now.

1:27:10.564 --> 1:27:11.523
So,

1:27:12.649 --> 1:27:14.318
are you going to disable
that EMP for me?

1:27:16.028 --> 1:27:17.487
Or you going to make me kill
your baby?

1:27:19.448 --> 1:27:20.657
‐ Oh my god.

1:27:23.118 --> 1:27:23.827
Stop!

1:27:25.662 --> 1:27:26.288
Stop!

1:27:56.401 --> 1:27:57.361
Fuck.

1:28:29.268 --> 1:28:30.018
Fuck.

1:29:48.263 --> 1:29:49.014
Hey.

1:29:50.557 --> 1:29:51.600
‐ Hey.

1:30:00.484 --> 1:30:01.652
‐ I love you, Sam.

1:30:04.988 --> 1:30:06.615
‐ I love you, too, Squirrel.

1:30:32.099 --> 1:30:32.975
‐ Sam.

1:30:35.143 --> 1:30:35.978
Take it.

1:30:56.498 --> 1:30:57.332
‐ G.

1:30:59.084 --> 1:30:59.918
Hmm.

1:31:01.420 --> 1:31:02.421
‐ We gotta move.

1:31:36.163 --> 1:31:37.372
Over here! Wait!

1:31:37.372 --> 1:31:38.749
Wait. Here!

1:31:39.374 --> 1:31:41.001
Please, over here.

1:31:45.631 --> 1:31:47.591
He's going to scan you.
Do not move.

1:31:58.018 --> 1:31:58.852
Remove.

1:32:08.612 --> 1:32:12.407
‐ I‐I‐I don't know what paperwork
you might need or‐‐

1:32:12.991 --> 1:32:15.077
We, we don't, we don't have anything,
but I just‐‐

1:32:15.077 --> 1:32:16.036
‐ I'm sorry.

1:32:16.954 --> 1:32:19.748
I, I know that
you only take the mothers.

1:32:19.748 --> 1:32:21.458
‐ I can only take the baby.

1:32:27.339 --> 1:32:28.298
‐ What?

1:32:28.298 --> 1:32:30.217
‐ Korea will only take the baby.

1:32:30.717 --> 1:32:31.927
Not the parents.

1:32:36.932 --> 1:32:37.766
‐ Please.

1:32:38.976 --> 1:32:40.686
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I don't think you understand.

1:32:40.686 --> 1:32:41.645
No, please.
There's not the space.

1:32:41.645 --> 1:32:42.938
Please. Please just‐‐

1:32:42.938 --> 1:32:45.190
You can take us.
It's only three of us.

1:32:45.190 --> 1:32:48.902
I‐I‐I promise I will do... anything.

1:32:48.902 --> 1:32:50.362
Please, just please.
I'm sorry.

1:32:50.362 --> 1:32:52.406
‐ Please take us.
It's not just the space.

1:32:53.031 --> 1:32:54.658
You're another mouth to feed.

1:32:54.992 --> 1:32:58.245
Another person to take care
for medical attention.

1:32:59.830 --> 1:33:01.999
When you get to Korea,
you will need a job.

1:33:01.999 --> 1:33:04.001
You will need a house.
You see?

1:33:06.336 --> 1:33:07.129
‐ Please.

1:33:08.005 --> 1:33:09.173
‐ The baby is simple.

1:33:12.301 --> 1:33:13.302
But you're not.

1:33:18.682 --> 1:33:19.766
He's very ill.

1:33:28.775 --> 1:33:29.484
‐ G.

1:33:36.450 --> 1:33:38.869
‐ I'm gonna make it work.
I'm gonna get us on the plane.

1:33:38.869 --> 1:33:40.662
I‐I'm gonna get us on the boat,
I promise.

1:33:42.456 --> 1:33:43.332
It's gonna be okay.

1:33:45.375 --> 1:33:46.668
It's gonna be okay.

1:33:47.044 --> 1:33:48.754
‐ I don't think I'm gonna pull
through this, G.

1:33:48.754 --> 1:33:49.796
‐ Don't say that.

1:33:50.088 --> 1:33:52.216
We'll be fine. We'll be fine.
‐ Just listen, Just listen to me.

1:33:52.216 --> 1:33:53.550
G, if he stays here,

1:33:55.219 --> 1:33:56.553
there's a good chance he'll die.

1:33:59.306 --> 1:34:00.599
If he's out there,

1:34:02.142 --> 1:34:03.519
there's a good chance he'll live.

1:34:08.190 --> 1:34:09.274
Look at me, G.

1:34:09.900 --> 1:34:10.901
I'm fucked.

1:34:14.071 --> 1:34:15.197
I'm bleeding out here.

1:34:17.074 --> 1:34:18.992
I don't think I'm fully pulling
through this.

1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:24.790
I can't protect you, G.

1:34:26.625 --> 1:34:28.961
And you can't really protect him.

1:34:29.378 --> 1:34:30.379
Not really.

1:34:34.049 --> 1:34:35.384
This could be a good thing.

1:34:40.806 --> 1:34:42.391
Let's give him a chance.

1:34:46.478 --> 1:34:47.604
‐ Yeah.

1:34:54.069 --> 1:34:55.237
‐ I love you, buddy.

1:35:22.514 --> 1:35:24.183
‐ Can I just have one minute?

1:35:24.183 --> 1:35:26.059
Just one minute, please. Just‐‐

1:35:27.144 --> 1:35:28.145
‐ Fill this out.

1:35:30.147 --> 1:35:31.356
‐ Thank you.

1:36:03.055 --> 1:36:03.889
My boy.

1:36:05.432 --> 1:36:06.350
My son.

1:36:10.687 --> 1:36:11.647
My love.

1:36:15.484 --> 1:36:17.694
I didn't want
any of this for you.

1:36:20.322 --> 1:36:23.367
I would have done anything
to give you a normal life.

1:36:27.538 --> 1:36:28.997
One with parents

1:36:31.208 --> 1:36:31.917
and a home

1:36:33.168 --> 1:36:34.628
and friends down the street.

1:36:36.380 --> 1:36:39.049
You would have gone to school
in the city that you were born

1:36:39.967 --> 1:36:42.636
and come home
and told us about your day.

1:36:49.142 --> 1:36:51.019
We would have taken summers
on the shore.

1:36:53.856 --> 1:36:56.191
And that's where some
of the most intense memories

1:36:56.191 --> 1:36:57.401
of childhood would have been.

1:37:04.825 --> 1:37:07.160
Your father would have read
to you in silly voices.

1:37:09.496 --> 1:37:12.165
You would go to sleep
dreaming of the adventures

1:37:12.165 --> 1:37:14.084
you would have
with your friends in the woods.

1:37:22.009 --> 1:37:23.135
In the perfect world,

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:25.095
none of this
would have happened.

1:37:28.223 --> 1:37:31.310
We would have worked to be
the best parents that we could have been.

1:37:34.271 --> 1:37:35.898
We would have been a family

1:37:37.733 --> 1:37:39.610
and the world wouldn't be
falling apart.

1:37:43.488 --> 1:37:44.990
But I can't give you that.

1:37:48.076 --> 1:37:49.453
I can't give you any of it.

1:37:52.039 --> 1:37:53.332
So instead,

1:37:54.791 --> 1:37:57.336
I'm going to give you
the only thing that I have left.

1:38:00.756 --> 1:38:01.882
A chance.

1:38:05.344 --> 1:38:06.803
A chance at a normal life,

1:38:08.931 --> 1:38:11.350
with a new family
in a new place.

1:38:17.147 --> 1:38:19.149
I need you to know
that I love you.

1:38:21.610 --> 1:38:23.654
I need you to know
that I wanted you.

1:38:25.197 --> 1:38:26.907
God, I wanted you in my life. I‐‐

1:38:28.325 --> 1:38:29.952
I wanted you by my side.

1:38:33.705 --> 1:38:35.123
I just couldn't‐‐
It's time to go.

1:38:36.291 --> 1:38:38.836
‐ Please let me finish this.
I'm almost done. If you just‐‐

1:38:38.836 --> 1:38:40.504
‐ Sorry. We must go now.

1:38:51.515 --> 1:38:53.725
‐ Okay. Okay

1:38:59.231 --> 1:39:00.107
Okay.

1:39:15.539 --> 1:39:16.498
Here.

1:39:26.425 --> 1:39:27.259
‐ What's your name?

1:39:28.135 --> 1:39:29.178
‐ Soyoung.

1:39:33.015 --> 1:39:35.309
‐ Please find someone
who will take care of him.

1:39:37.394 --> 1:39:38.687
Someone who will love him.

1:39:39.813 --> 1:39:40.939
Please.

1:40:11.094 --> 1:40:12.804
‐ He's gonna be okay.
‐ He's gonna be okay.

1:40:13.055 --> 1:40:14.806
‐ He's gonna be okay.
‐ He's gonna be okay.

1:40:15.307 --> 1:40:16.642
He's gonna be okay.

1:40:17.518 --> 1:40:18.769
He's gonna be okay.

1:40:20.479 --> 1:40:22.105
He's gonna be okay.

1:40:23.190 --> 1:40:24.691
He's gonna be okay.

1:40:26.193 --> 1:40:27.653
He's gonna be okay.

1:40:27.653 --> 1:40:28.820
He's gonna be okay.

1:40:29.530 --> 1:40:31.031
He's gonna be okay.

1:40:38.956 --> 1:40:40.332
‐ He's gonna be okay.

1:42:51.046 --> 1:42:52.214
Drop the pack.

1:42:53.507 --> 1:42:54.508
Hold out your hand.

1:43:00.347 --> 1:43:01.223
She's good.

1:43:02.683 --> 1:43:03.809
We're heading to Portland.

1:43:03.809 --> 1:43:06.520
They're setting up a new base there.
We're bringing whoever we can find.

1:43:07.145 --> 1:43:08.146
Do you want to come with us?

1:43:37.551 --> 1:43:38.468
‐ Okay.

1:43:39.052 --> 1:43:39.928
Alright then.

1:44:03.785 --> 1:44:05.412
Okay. Let's go!
