WEBVTT

00:04.313 --> 00:06.079
It's our anniversary today.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.746
What do you mean, it's our anniversary?

00:08.747 --> 00:12.476
I mean since I came to America. Yes, it's been a week.

00:13.414 --> 00:17.099
I still can't believe you flew 6,000 miles to see me.

00:17.099 --> 00:19.939
I cannot believe you cannot believe.

00:22.525 --> 00:24.825
How should we celebrate?

00:24.826 --> 00:26.670
Well, we should stay in bed all day.
All day?

00:26.670 --> 00:28.197
Yeah. You don't think we should go out

00:28.197 --> 00:30.209
to look at the sun or anything?

00:30.657 --> 00:32.656
The sun? The sun will be there tomorrow.

00:32.656 --> 00:34.949
I know, but so will my children.

00:35.690 --> 00:37.252
And once they come...

00:37.252 --> 00:39.317
I know, no more spending the night.

00:39.318 --> 00:42.251
No. I'm sorry.

00:42.252 --> 00:44.683
You know, their dad just got remarried.

00:44.684 --> 00:46.304
And I don't think it'd be right for them to,

00:46.304 --> 00:49.707
you know, come home from Europe
after being there for months,

00:49.707 --> 00:52.428
to find me shacked up with a...
I... I understand.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.186
Thank you.

00:55.711 --> 00:57.278
Go away.

00:58.377 --> 01:00.776
You should take it.

01:00.777 --> 01:03.877
Oh, God. It's probably
my mother. Go pick it up.

01:05.310 --> 01:06.309
Hello.

01:06.894 --> 01:10.143
Oh, hi, Joe. That's my ex.

01:10.414 --> 01:12.182
What's up?

01:15.721 --> 01:17.737
You said tomorrow.

01:18.521 --> 01:20.993
Well, you know what?
Thanks for letting me know.

01:22.019 --> 01:23.123
You've gotta go.

01:23.353 --> 01:25.352
Where? Out the back.

01:25.353 --> 01:29.169
Hello. We're here. Mom.

01:29.986 --> 01:32.128
Come on. They're here. Mom, we're here.

01:32.128 --> 01:34.886
Okay, don't leave till my ex
drives out of the driveway.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.314
I'll call you.

01:36.841 --> 01:40.231
Mommy. Hello. Hello. Mom. Where is she?

01:40.231 --> 01:43.973
Hi. Oh, my God. Mommy!

01:43.973 --> 01:46.339
Look at you.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.517
We missed you. Oh, you,
too. I love the hair.

01:49.517 --> 01:52.016
Thank you. It's so cute. How was Roma?

01:52.017 --> 01:53.516
Good. Thanks, Joe.

01:54.372 --> 01:55.195
We missed you.

01:55.195 --> 01:57.013
You both look so beautiful.
Thank you.

01:57.013 --> 02:00.284
Should we get your stuff?
Yeah. Okay.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.827 --> 02:11.101
Thank you.

02:11.515 --> 02:14.514
Oh, you're awake.
Guided meditation.

02:17.282 --> 02:19.281
You're visualizing fireworks.

02:19.282 --> 02:21.334
Yeah. It's like the 4th of July in here.

02:21.334 --> 02:23.008
"Imagine your white blood cells

02:23.008 --> 02:25.428
are hurtling towards a cancer cell...

02:25.428 --> 02:27.355
And with a flash, it explodes.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.849
Then feel the warmth as a healing white light

02:30.849 --> 02:32.506
Rains down on your body."

02:32.506 --> 02:33.269
Mm. Oh, my God.

02:33.269 --> 02:36.213
It sounds so stupid when you read it like that.

02:36.213 --> 02:39.235
Kitty, I have seen you destroy major,

02:39.235 --> 02:41.889
blowhard congressman with
sheer will and brain power.

02:41.889 --> 02:43.938
I'm all for you using that to heal yourself.

02:43.938 --> 02:47.665
Yeah, but taking down congressmen
was a lot more fun.

02:51.946 --> 02:53.945
You know, there is a, uh, tribute

02:53.946 --> 02:57.211
to William F. Buckley tonight at the Reagan library.

02:57.212 --> 02:59.844
I'm sure there's plenty of party unfaithful

02:59.845 --> 03:02.226
you could straighten out if you want to.

03:02.226 --> 03:06.145
Tonight? Really?
Well... well, yes.

03:06.146 --> 03:07.913
Well, Robert, do you have
any idea how long it's been

03:07.913 --> 03:09.640
since I've been out of the house
other than to go to the doctor?

03:09.640 --> 03:12.069
I mean, yes. I am... i
am absolutely, 100%,

03:12.069 --> 03:14.226
totally and completely up for it.

03:14.226 --> 03:17.061
Good. Then get back to visualizing fireworks.
Okay.

03:17.061 --> 03:19.984
I'll come get you around 6:00. We'll use the chopper.
Okay.

03:23.534 --> 03:25.665
No, no, I... I'm telling you, he's beyond awful.

03:25.665 --> 03:27.141
I mean it's hopeless.
Justin cannot dance.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.154
You know what he suggested
we do for our wedding dance?

03:29.154 --> 03:30.803
That we sway. That we just sway.

03:30.804 --> 03:32.971
Okay, sweetie, don't panic.

03:32.971 --> 03:36.652
Maybe we need to hire a professional.

03:36.652 --> 03:39.269
Yeah. Hey, uh, I'm sorry to interrupt...

03:39.269 --> 03:41.114
Yeah. But I'm covering the
phones, and there's a guy on there

03:41.114 --> 03:43.045
Who, uh, called and said he wants to talk to you,

03:43.045 --> 03:44.505
and he's not gonna take no for an answer.

03:44.505 --> 03:46.108
Did he say what it was about?

03:46.108 --> 03:47.575
Uh, he said his name is Felix Newsome,

03:47.575 --> 03:49.663
and he's from National Capital Redemption.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.537
Mm. Sounds like a cold call to me.

03:51.537 --> 03:53.838
Tell him I'm not interested. Okay.

03:55.178 --> 03:58.146
So why don't we hire a dance coach?

03:58.147 --> 04:00.670
Because, mom, they're expensive.
I'll take care of it.

04:00.670 --> 04:04.215
I've already put a deposit on a block of 30 rooms

04:04.215 --> 04:06.204
at the Hakalea Regency.

04:06.551 --> 04:09.617
Dance lessons are a drop in the bucket.

04:09.618 --> 04:10.883
Mom, you are being so generous.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.660
I don't know how I'm gonna
thank you for all of this.

04:12.660 --> 04:17.084
I don't want you to thank me. I want to do it.

04:17.084 --> 04:20.885
You deserve the perfect wedding day.

04:21.442 --> 04:24.037
I can't believe you made these yourself.

04:24.037 --> 04:27.560
With all the orders that I'm
getting, I can barely keep up.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.556
I'm gonna have to figure out
a way to increase production.

04:30.557 --> 04:31.482
I can't do it myself,

04:31.482 --> 04:33.250
not while working double waitressing shifts.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.409
Well, how much do you think you need?

04:34.409 --> 04:36.343
$10,000 should cover the materials,

04:36.343 --> 04:38.093
but then there's also... 

04:38.093 --> 04:41.814
Hi. Hi... Michelle.
Michelle, of course. How are... 

04:41.814 --> 04:44.851
Wow. It's... it's been a
while. Oh, are those for me?

04:44.851 --> 04:47.131
Uh, sorry, no. They're for Kitty.

04:47.768 --> 04:49.105
Hi. Hi.

04:49.105 --> 04:51.533
Michelle has been busy making handbags.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.535
Wow, you made these?

04:52.535 --> 04:54.569
She has her own line. She's looking for investors.

04:54.569 --> 04:56.696
But I said we needed to talk about it first.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.610
Of cour... of course, yeah. We should... 

04:59.610 --> 05:00.620
Yeah, we should talk, definitely.

05:00.620 --> 05:01.985
I have a business plan and everything,

05:01.985 --> 05:05.037
and you should trust my
judgment, because I was

05:05.037 --> 05:07.046
the first one to say that you
two were meant for each other.

05:07.046 --> 05:08.898
Yes, you're definitely right about that.

05:08.898 --> 05:10.563
Um, I'm sure Scotty told you,

05:10.563 --> 05:12.219
Uh, we... we want to have a baby.

05:12.219 --> 05:13.304
Yeah, he said that you were gonna

05:13.304 --> 05:15.301
put it off for a little while, though, right?
Yes.

05:15.301 --> 05:16.801
Uh, well, yes and no.

05:16.801 --> 05:19.666
Uh, you see, we actually
met with a surrogacy agency,

05:19.667 --> 05:22.033
and you would not believe
how much they charge.

05:22.034 --> 05:24.532
And, um, seeing as this is something

05:24.533 --> 05:27.000
we want to do eventually, I'm not sure if

05:27.001 --> 05:31.053
we want to tie ourselves in
to any financial commitments.

05:32.034 --> 05:34.641
Oh. Oh, okay. I... I understand.

05:36.489 --> 05:38.949
Just out of curiosity, how much is it?

05:39.549 --> 05:42.259
Oh, uh, it's... it's, uh, it's well into the six figures.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.321
That's how much a surrogate makes?

05:44.321 --> 05:45.482
Oh, well, you know, there's a... 

05:45.483 --> 05:46.779
there's a whole list of people you have to pay... 

05:46.779 --> 05:49.366
the agency, the egg donor, uh, doctors... 

05:49.366 --> 05:52.564
and we want a local surrogate,
so that's another up-charge.

05:52.564 --> 05:54.817
And there's a year-long waiting list.

05:54.817 --> 05:57.399
Oh, my God.
What's the matter?

05:57.399 --> 06:01.447
Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?
 I don't know.

06:01.447 --> 06:05.417
What are you thinking?
I could be your surrogate.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.224
Oh, that's so funny.
No, no, I... I'm serious.

06:07.225 --> 06:08.988
I mean, I could quit
my job, and that way,

06:08.989 --> 06:10.416
I could make my handbags full-time.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.182
And I could have your baby.

06:12.182 --> 06:14.419
And it'd save you guys, like, a ton of money.

06:14.419 --> 06:18.257
You guys, it's perfect.

06:22.150 --> 06:25.545
Sarah, I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.

06:25.545 --> 06:27.229
I have a full house right now

06:27.229 --> 06:29.915
with Kitty and Robert and Evan staying here.

06:29.916 --> 06:31.574
I can't take in some random Frenchman.

06:31.574 --> 06:33.644
Well, he's not a random Frenchman, mom.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.518
Come on. It's just for a couple of days.

06:35.518 --> 06:37.917
It's too early to introduce him to Paige and coop,

06:37.917 --> 06:39.200
and I need some time alone with them

06:39.200 --> 06:40.598
to break the news about Kitty.

06:40.598 --> 06:43.492
Sweetie, I'm thrilled you found someone you like,

06:43.492 --> 06:45.766
but this is really not a good time.

06:45.766 --> 06:49.007
Besides that, I don't even
know this guy. None of us do.

06:49.007 --> 06:50.117
I don't even know his name.

06:50.117 --> 06:51.858
Well, his name's Luc, and
if you want to meet him,

06:51.858 --> 06:53.415
I can bring him in and introduce him.

06:53.415 --> 06:54.785
He's waiting out in the front.

06:55.953 --> 06:58.126
Sarah, for God sakes.
You're trying to railroad me.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.929
I will meet him. That's it.

06:59.929 --> 07:02.018
Meet who?
Luc.

07:03.330 --> 07:06.630
Lu... Lu... Luc is here?
Yes, he's outside.

07:06.631 --> 07:08.129
Mom won't let him stay

07:08.130 --> 07:10.563
'cause she says she doesn't have enough room.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.215
Well, Kitty, I just don't think
it's good to have a stranger

07:15.215 --> 07:17.538
wandering around the house
when you're not feeling well.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.034
Actually, I think that Robert and I

07:19.034 --> 07:20.406
are gonna go back to the ranch.

07:21.204 --> 07:23.910
You know, just until my next treatment.
What?

07:23.910 --> 07:25.709
Okay, I'll go get Luc.

07:26.033 --> 07:29.565
Kitty, don't you think it's too soon to go home?

07:29.566 --> 07:30.739
No, no, honestly, mom.

07:30.739 --> 07:32.383
I-I woke up this morning,
and I don't... I don't know,

07:32.383 --> 07:35.298
I just... I... I feel so much better.

07:35.298 --> 07:37.036
I mean, I'm... I'm gonna
go to an event tonight

07:37.036 --> 07:39.118
At the Reagan library.
Tonight?

07:39.118 --> 07:40.973
Oh, honey, are you sure?

07:40.973 --> 07:43.232
Yesterday, you could barely keep anything down.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.798
Look, sweetie, you might feel good today,

07:45.799 --> 07:48.375
but if you do too much too
soon, you could have a setback.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.691
Mom, I think you should look at it this way... 

07:50.691 --> 07:53.539
you were so brilliant at taking care of me,

07:53.539 --> 07:56.280
that I just... I just... I... I bounced back.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.887
Mom, Kitty, I would like to
introduce you to Luc Laurent.

07:59.887 --> 08:02.683
Nora, I'm so pleased to meet you.

08:03.468 --> 08:05.834
And thank you for inviting
me to this beautiful home.

08:05.835 --> 08:06.502
You're welcome.

08:06.502 --> 08:09.302
You must be Kitty.
Yeah, hi.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.864
You know, Sarah told me that
you're not feeling well lately,

08:12.864 --> 08:15.112
but to me, you look radiant.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.758
I... Is that the word... r... radiant... radiant?

08:17.759 --> 08:18.751
Yeah, that's a good word.

08:18.751 --> 08:20.883
Like the sun. Yeah, yeah, like... like the sun.

08:20.883 --> 08:22.128
Beautiful.

08:22.246 --> 08:24.844
Okay, then. Well, I'll just settle Luc in.

08:24.844 --> 08:26.743
My room's good, right, mom?

08:26.744 --> 08:29.743
See you later.
You'll love it. It's... it's the blue room.

08:31.243 --> 08:33.743
You know, um...

08:33.744 --> 08:37.010
Mom, I think that maybe you're right.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.042
I think that I should probably stay

08:39.043 --> 08:41.609
for just a couple more days,

08:41.610 --> 08:43.318
just to make sure, you know,

08:43.318 --> 08:46.488
that I don't have some sort of setback.

08:57.159 --> 08:58.997
Robert. Nora.

09:00.105 --> 09:01.516
Am I interrupting something?

09:01.516 --> 09:04.028
No, no. Is Kitty okay?
She's the same.

09:04.028 --> 09:06.025
I... I was just over at the Asian market

09:06.025 --> 09:08.493
trying to find pickled ginger.
It's good for your stomach. Mm.

09:08.493 --> 09:10.844
But could I talk to you for a second?
Sure.

09:12.322 --> 09:15.616
I'm... I'm worried about Kitty
going to this event tonight.

09:15.616 --> 09:17.221
Mm. You know how excited she gets

09:17.222 --> 09:18.891
at political gatherings like this.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.454
And she'll be around so many people,

09:20.454 --> 09:22.314
and her white blood cell count is down

09:22.314 --> 09:24.179
and her immune system is not strong.

09:24.179 --> 09:25.944
I don't want her to pick up a virus.

09:25.944 --> 09:28.934
Okay, I promise you, I will keep an eye on her.

09:28.934 --> 09:31.706
I will watch her like a
hawk. Just try not to worry.

09:31.706 --> 09:33.421
Well, that's easier said than done.

09:33.422 --> 09:35.822
Well, you gotta trust me on this one.

09:35.823 --> 09:37.388
She's gonna be okay.

09:37.389 --> 09:39.154
Okay, I have a room full
of angry constituents,

09:39.154 --> 09:41.845
and I should...
All right, go. Go, go, go.

09:44.923 --> 09:46.783
Look, this is a huge step, and I'd rather

09:46.783 --> 09:48.563
do it the normal way, which is through an agency.

09:48.563 --> 09:51.555
And normal to you is picking
some stranger out of a book?

09:51.556 --> 09:53.764
That's how it's done. Well, normal to me

09:53.764 --> 09:56.500
is finding someone I know who cares about us

09:56.500 --> 09:58.939
and who's invested in going
through this process with us.

09:58.939 --> 10:01.431
I'm not comfortable with her being our surrogate.
Why?

10:01.431 --> 10:03.318
You have to admit, she's a little flaky.

10:03.318 --> 10:04.555
She is not. She's my friend.

10:04.555 --> 10:06.549
And she helped me through
a lot of really tough times

10:06.549 --> 10:08.436
when a lot of people labeled me as flaky.

10:08.436 --> 10:10.741
You know what? I feel like this
is another case of my opinion

10:10.741 --> 10:12.702
not mattering as much as yours does..
I'm s... I'm... 

10:12.702 --> 10:14.382
Would you mind not taking a text message

10:14.382 --> 10:15.357
while I'm talking to you?

10:15.357 --> 10:19.191
It's from Kitty. "You should
really come over to mom's."

10:19.191 --> 10:20.799
I have to go. I'm really sorry.
Kevin, I really... ugh.

10:20.799 --> 10:22.679
No, I'm sorry. We'll talk about this later.

10:28.356 --> 10:29.701
You go forward, I go back.

10:29.701 --> 10:34.440
So it's back, side, close. Forward, side, close.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.806
Ba... okay, here we go.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.301
You d... put your arm around me.
Mom, mom, mom, no.

10:37.301 --> 10:39.087
This is weird. I'm... I don't want to do this.

10:39.087 --> 10:39.975
You have to get used to it.

10:39.975 --> 10:42.859
There's a whole lot of
protocol about the first dance.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.857
And Holly has done so much for this wedding.

10:44.858 --> 10:47.123
I don't want the Walkers to be the weak link.

10:47.124 --> 10:47.792
Come on. We have to do this

10:47.792 --> 10:49.786
before Kitty and Evan wake up from their nap.

10:49.787 --> 10:53.657
Okay, now you go forward, side, close.

10:53.658 --> 10:55.857
Back, side, close. All right.

10:55.858 --> 10:58.857
You have to look up. Don't look at your feet.
Mom, I'm sorry.

10:58.858 --> 11:00.396
I'm not gonna need to know
how to do this, all right?

11:00.396 --> 11:02.300
I'm not gonna be doing
the box fox at my wedding.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.245
It is the box step. It's the foundation for

11:04.245 --> 11:05.456
all of ballroom dancing.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.719
You learn this, and you've learned everything.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.457
Now come on. Here we go. Here we go.

11:07.457 --> 11:08.557
It's old-fashioned, mom. I'm not gonna do it.

11:08.557 --> 11:10.885
You're twisting my hand.
First of all, you have to... 

11:10.885 --> 11:12.155
Well, I don't know what to do, mom.

11:12.155 --> 11:14.588
Hi. You must be Justin.
Nice to meet you. Yeah,

11:14.588 --> 11:16.436
you're Luc, right? Nice to meet you.

11:16.436 --> 11:19.027
You guys were practicing the box step?
Yeah.

11:19.027 --> 11:20.868
Uh, yeah. It's for my... my wedding.

11:20.868 --> 11:23.294
Oh, well, you know there is more,

11:23.294 --> 11:25.941
like, modern dances you can
do, especially at your age.

11:25.941 --> 11:27.764
You know, uh, that's a little stiff.

11:27.764 --> 11:30.204
Yeah, ones that maybe aren't so old-fashioned?
Yeah.

11:30.204 --> 11:32.968
My... my grandmother ran a dance studio in Paris,

11:32.968 --> 11:34.734
and she made me dance with all those girls.

11:34.734 --> 11:36.275
I mean, not that I minded.

11:36.275 --> 11:39.589
Um, I'm sayin', I can really
help you out, man, if... uh...

11:39.589 --> 11:41.798
You know, we don't want
to keep you from your swim.

11:41.798 --> 11:43.794
Is your bride a good dancer? Uh, yeah.

11:43.794 --> 11:46.985
You know, she... she's, like,
practically semi-professional.

11:46.985 --> 11:48.824
Okay, well, I have a
dance that I can show you.

11:48.824 --> 11:50.695
It looks like you will lead, everything,

11:50.695 --> 11:53.022
but she will do all the move.
What about that...

11:53.022 --> 11:54.937
Let me show you. Let me show you.
No, I... 

11:54.937 --> 11:56.361
Luc, you know, he barely will dance with me.
Yeah,

11:56.361 --> 11:57.933
I really don't think he's gonna dance with you.

11:57.933 --> 12:00.968
Don't worry. You will love this. Watch.

12:00.968 --> 12:02.720
I'm not really a dancer... 
I'll be her. You be you.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.381
Here. Here we go.

12:05.870 --> 12:09.835
Un, deux, trois.

12:09.835 --> 12:11.796
Okay, turn. No, no, no. Stay there. Okay.

12:13.047 --> 12:15.396
You turn around like this. Okay?

12:17.347 --> 12:19.279
Whoa. Hey. Okay.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.012
Come back for a big finish.

12:21.013 --> 12:22.055
You support her back,

12:22.055 --> 12:24.322
keep your balance, because we're gonna dip.

12:24.322 --> 12:27.648
No, we're not dipping. We're not
dipping. I don't like dipping.

12:28.159 --> 12:31.191
Oh! Kevin, what the hell is the matter with you?

12:31.192 --> 12:32.162
I... I... I don't... I don't know.

12:32.162 --> 12:34.266
I th... I just lost feeling in my extremities.

12:34.266 --> 12:36.041
You scared the hell outta
me. I coulda dropped him. Wh... 

12:37.581 --> 12:39.587
I'm Luc. Nice to meet you, Kevin.

12:39.587 --> 12:43.903
I'm... I'm Kevin.
Let me help you. Sorry.

12:44.793 --> 12:47.683
Would you get a grip? Luc, don't do it.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.131
I'm gonna get a broom.

12:49.749 --> 12:50.650
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

12:50.650 --> 12:53.395
Okay, you get points for persistence,

12:53.395 --> 12:56.506
but what exactly is "national capital redemption"?

12:56.506 --> 12:59.403
We regulate securities
dealers and distributors.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.191
Okay, so why are you here?

13:01.191 --> 13:03.390
You are familiar with the
Lasgrove investment fund?

13:03.391 --> 13:05.023
Yes, they manage my money.

13:05.024 --> 13:07.391
I'm sorry to say, the fund's in default.

13:08.723 --> 13:11.089
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, see... 

13:11.090 --> 13:12.492
Lasgrove defrauded its investors

13:12.492 --> 13:14.354
with overstated rates of return,

13:14.354 --> 13:16.989
new investor funds covering margin calls.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.490
What are their assets?

13:19.491 --> 13:21.989
At the moment, the fund has assets

13:21.990 --> 13:26.257
amounting to roughly 1% of
its outstanding liabilities.

13:29.057 --> 13:30.548
Oh, my God.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.411
Your attorney may be
able to pursue a claim

13:33.411 --> 13:36.310
against the personal assets
of the funds managers, but... 

13:36.310 --> 13:39.080
but that will take years. I'm afraid so.

13:40.685 --> 13:41.764
I'm very sorry.

13:43.373 --> 13:45.697
You want to see what we got for uncle Kevin?

13:45.697 --> 13:47.408
It's really cool.

13:47.408 --> 13:51.230
A stein. From Dusseldorf.
He's gonna love it.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.972
Wait till you see what we
got for aunt Kitty and Evan.

13:53.973 --> 13:57.105
When can we see everyone so
we can give 'em our gifts?

13:57.106 --> 13:59.438
Uh... you'll see them soon.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.972
Listen, honey, um, before we see aunt Kitty,

14:02.973 --> 14:04.677
there's something I've got to tell you guys.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.308
We got this in Florence. Think she'll like it?

14:07.308 --> 14:09.768
I think she'll love it.

14:15.406 --> 14:16.693
What's wrong, mom?

14:19.139 --> 14:22.572
Nothing. It's just so beautiful.

14:22.573 --> 14:25.238
What were you gonna say before?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.636
Aunt Kitty's gonna be
so happy to see you two.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.312
She's missed you so much.
Cool.

14:42.085 --> 14:43.240
Oh, come on, you guys.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.230
You have to at least pretend not to be staring.
Oh, please.

14:46.230 --> 14:48.706
This coming from the person
who sent us a text message

14:48.706 --> 14:51.475
Telling us to rush over here
as if the house was on fire?

14:51.475 --> 14:53.154
The house is on fire.

14:53.502 --> 14:54.955
He can't see us anyway.

14:54.955 --> 14:58.573
He has chlorine in his eyes
and dancing in his soul.

14:58.573 --> 15:00.155
He's a really strong swimmer.

15:00.155 --> 15:03.173
I wish he'd stop swimming
and get out of the pool.

15:03.173 --> 15:04.995
Oh, hey, give this to Kevin.

15:05.859 --> 15:08.226
What for?
The drool on your chin.

15:08.226 --> 15:09.689
Can you guys give it a rest, please?

15:09.689 --> 15:11.275
Justin, what is wrong with you?

15:11.275 --> 15:13.908
I'm just tired of listening to
you all objectify him, all right?

15:13.908 --> 15:15.635
I mean, he happens to be a very nice guy.

15:15.635 --> 15:18.742
"Objectify"? Oh, Justin!

15:20.361 --> 15:22.661
Kitty, for goodness sakes.

15:22.662 --> 15:24.661
I thought you were taking a nap.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.809
Oh, Scotty, Rebecca, what brings you here?

15:26.809 --> 15:28.238
Kitty.

15:31.263 --> 15:36.127
Oh, yes. Adonis bathes in the sea... 

15:36.128 --> 15:37.685
It makes total sense now.

15:37.685 --> 15:40.593
Mom, I'm getting the distinct
impression that you don't like him.

15:40.593 --> 15:42.195
I like him just fine, just fine.

15:42.195 --> 15:44.633
If he were underfoot in your house,

15:44.633 --> 15:46.298
you would not be so enamored of him.

15:46.298 --> 15:47.070
Wanna bet?

15:47.070 --> 15:51.357
All right. He's handsome
in an obvious sort of way.

15:51.357 --> 15:53.560
But that's no reason to act
like a bunch of teenagers.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.167
Yeah, I agree. Hi, everybody.

15:55.167 --> 15:59.741
Oh, for God sake. Has everyone
in this family lost his mind?

15:59.741 --> 16:01.889
No, I just... somebody said it
was a great day for a swim,

16:01.889 --> 16:03.265
so here I am.

16:03.265 --> 16:04.850
Kitty, look, I'm gonna go in the house

16:04.850 --> 16:06.204
and make you something cold to drink

16:06.204 --> 16:08.887
and maybe a tuna fish sandwich would be a good idea.

16:08.887 --> 16:10.759
He's getting out. He's getting out.

16:17.195 --> 16:18.218
He needs a towel. Should I give him a towel?

16:18.218 --> 16:19.845
Don't give him a towel.

16:25.119 --> 16:29.407
Hey. Hey. Luc, bonjour.
Voilà, je m'apelle Saul.

16:29.407 --> 16:31.409
Enchanté. Je suis l'oncle de Sarah.

16:31.409 --> 16:33.808
Unbelievable.
Oh, he is.

16:33.808 --> 16:35.523
Oh, my...

16:39.737 --> 16:41.970
So how did they handle the news about Kitty?

16:41.971 --> 16:45.231
I didn't tell them yet.
Look, I was about to, mom,

16:45.231 --> 16:47.712
but they were so happy and
excited about their trip,

16:47.712 --> 16:49.763
and they were so proud of
all the presents they got,

16:49.763 --> 16:52.671
I just... I just didn't have the heart to tell them

16:52.671 --> 16:54.376
that their aunt Kitty is so sick.

16:54.376 --> 16:56.396
Look, I know it's hard, but you can't put it off.

16:56.396 --> 16:57.847
They're gonna want to see her soon.

16:57.847 --> 16:59.846
Mom, I get it okay. I will handle it.

16:59.847 --> 17:01.846
Anyway, how are you and Luc getting along?

17:01.847 --> 17:03.653
He's not in the way or anything is he?

17:03.653 --> 17:04.646
If he is, just tell him.

17:04.647 --> 17:06.357
Or you know what? Tell me and I'll tell him.

17:06.357 --> 17:08.229
Look, as soon as Kitty and robert leave,

17:08.229 --> 17:10.434
I'm gonna pack Evan up, take him over there.

17:10.434 --> 17:11.977
I can put him to sleep, and then you can

17:11.977 --> 17:13.537
come over here and see for yourself.

17:13.537 --> 17:15.323
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait. What's wrong?

17:15.323 --> 17:16.953
I just want to see my grandkids.

17:16.953 --> 17:20.452
Besides, Luc is cooking a big
French dinner for everyone.

17:20.453 --> 17:22.199
And I'm not in the mood for another party.

17:22.199 --> 17:23.417
What do you mean, another party?

17:23.419 --> 17:26.252
We've already had a dancing party and a pool party.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.108
Oh, my God. You hate him, don't you?

17:28.109 --> 17:31.263
No, no, I don't. I like
him the exact right amount

17:31.263 --> 17:33.637
For someone who I just met this morning.

17:33.637 --> 17:34.694
I just was hoping

17:34.694 --> 17:37.460
to not have so much
commotion around Kitty today.

17:37.460 --> 17:39.453
Okay, mom. I get it. I'll
talk to him tonight, okay?

17:39.453 --> 17:40.981
Bye. All right. Bye.

17:42.964 --> 17:45.441
C'est magnifique. Quelle est l'herbe?

17:45.653 --> 17:48.752
Uh, échalotte, et un petit peu de basilic.

17:48.753 --> 17:52.063
Okay. Chop-Chop.
Ooh-La-La.

17:52.063 --> 17:54.364
Well, thank you.
Très, très jolie.

17:54.364 --> 17:59.319
Oh, Kitty, you look beautiful.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

17:59.319 --> 18:00.784
Yes, you do.

18:01.056 --> 18:03.316
Gosh, all those republicans don't deserve you.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.818
Well, thank you. I... I think.

18:06.123 --> 18:07.857
Goodbye, darling.

18:09.127 --> 18:11.771
Mom, please. Stop worrying. I'm gonna be fine.

18:11.771 --> 18:13.588
I'll take good care of her. Thank you.

18:13.588 --> 18:16.330
Okay, call me on my cell. Robert has his cell.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.792
Ring twice, 'cause it might be loud in there.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.354
If we don't answer it, it might be loud in there.

18:20.354 --> 18:21.603
Well, you don't worry.

18:21.603 --> 18:23.490
Bye. Bye.

18:24.532 --> 18:26.531
Do you want to try one of those mushrooms?

18:26.532 --> 18:30.035
No, no, no, and please...
make yourself at home.

18:30.035 --> 18:32.051
Come on, Evan. Let's go.

18:37.088 --> 18:38.781
I thought you were gonna
call me when you got home.

18:38.781 --> 18:41.951
Oh, sorry. I got distracted with business and...

18:43.399 --> 18:46.042
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

18:46.042 --> 18:50.037
I... I've been going over all
these expenses from the wedding.

18:50.037 --> 18:53.435
Do you have any idea how
expensive a photographer is?

18:53.436 --> 18:56.835
I was thinking that maybe you could do it.

18:57.815 --> 19:00.947
Yeah, I... I guess I could do it,
but I'm the father of the bride.

19:00.947 --> 19:04.122
I mean, I might be a little busy
walking Rebecca down the aisle.

19:04.122 --> 19:06.868
Then why don't you pitch
in and pay for a few things,

19:06.868 --> 19:09.539
being the father of the bride?

19:10.251 --> 19:13.875
Okay. So tell me what you need help with.

19:15.006 --> 19:17.100
Well, where would you like me to start?

19:17.100 --> 19:18.562
I don't know. How about with, um,

19:18.562 --> 19:19.733
what the hell is your problem?

19:19.733 --> 19:21.816
I don't need this from you right now.

19:21.816 --> 19:23.153
Wait a minute. I walk in the house,

19:23.153 --> 19:25.421
you... you bite me head
off, and now it's my fault?

19:25.421 --> 19:26.726
You know, I'm a little tired

19:26.726 --> 19:29.057
of being treated like the ATM machine.

19:32.139 --> 19:34.167
I would like to make a toast to Luc.

19:34.167 --> 19:37.470
He's the first chef-artist-dancer-swimmer

19:37.470 --> 19:39.757
that I have ever known... 
a true Renaissance man.

19:39.757 --> 19:42.172
Santé.
 Thank you. Santé.
Cheers.

19:42.172 --> 19:44.169
I have to say, I've experienced the artist-chef,

19:44.169 --> 19:46.335
but the swimmer-dancer is new to me.

19:46.335 --> 19:48.147
Then let's go for a swim, everybody.

19:48.147 --> 19:50.769
I don't think any of us brought our swimming trunks.
No.

19:50.769 --> 19:52.138
We don't need trunks. It's dark,

19:52.138 --> 19:53.542
and there are no children around.

19:55.629 --> 19:58.183
Luc, I love how really, really French you are.

19:58.183 --> 20:00.344
Yeah, and sadly, we're really, really American.

20:00.344 --> 20:02.781
And related.
Well, I guess that leaves dancing.

20:02.781 --> 20:04.907
Shall we?
I'm in.
Oh, me, too.

20:04.907 --> 20:05.973
I think I'm gonna pass on the whole thing.

20:05.973 --> 20:07.987
No, we have to show them what we learned.
No, we're in.

20:07.987 --> 20:09.434
We're in.
You're in.

20:09.434 --> 20:11.871
Here you are. I missed you.

20:11.871 --> 20:13.901
You know what ice cream's called in Rome?

20:13.901 --> 20:15.598
What?
Gelato.

20:16.351 --> 20:20.482
Well, if I lived in Italy, I would
eat gelato every day.

20:20.482 --> 20:22.933
I did. Didn't I, Paige?

20:25.245 --> 20:28.599
Uh, Paige, which did you
like best, France or Italy?

20:29.976 --> 20:31.260
I don't know.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.182
Honey, are you okay?

20:33.868 --> 20:35.733
Is aunt Kitty sick?

20:36.833 --> 20:38.256
I heard mom talking on the phone,

20:38.256 --> 20:40.769
and she said aunt Kitty's really sick.

20:41.922 --> 20:44.496
I feel like something really
bad happened while we were gone

20:44.496 --> 20:46.322
that nobody wants us to know about.

20:46.322 --> 20:47.462
No, look...

20:48.991 --> 20:51.081
I don't want you to be scared, okay?

20:51.081 --> 20:52.788
Listen to me.

20:52.788 --> 20:55.108
Aunt Kitty is sick.

20:55.108 --> 20:58.780
She has a disease, an illness, called lymphoma.

20:59.571 --> 21:01.986
A lot of people have it, and they're fine.

21:04.713 --> 21:07.598
Slow down. The Reagan
library's not going anywhere.

21:08.469 --> 21:09.883
Oh, I hate helicopters.

21:09.883 --> 21:11.114
Wait, I... I thought you loved helicopters.

21:11.114 --> 21:13.473
Robert, I spent two hours on my hair.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.146
And you look beautiful.

21:28.102 --> 21:30.157
What's this?
A celebration.

21:30.399 --> 21:33.151
I mean... it's not the reagan library.

21:33.151 --> 21:35.189
A celebration of what?

21:35.189 --> 21:36.771
Of getting through your first treatment

21:36.771 --> 21:38.441
with strength and good humor...

21:39.097 --> 21:41.975
of you and your white blood
cells fighting the good fight...

21:43.948 --> 21:45.728
of how much I love and admire you.

21:51.256 --> 21:53.364
You never do anything halfway, do you?

21:54.124 --> 21:55.662
Not when it comes to you.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.228
Oh, nice.

22:27.094 --> 22:28.376
Bravo. Wow. Beautiful.

22:28.376 --> 22:31.360
You're a miracle worker.
Thank you. Thank you.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.253
Okay, let's not go overboard.

22:33.253 --> 22:37.459
Go, Justin. Good boy. Well done.

22:37.460 --> 22:41.103
Okay, Ms. Walker, may I have
the honor of the next dance?

22:41.103 --> 22:43.239
Oh, I would be delighted.
What is your pleasure?

22:43.239 --> 22:46.295
Would you like to waltz or would you like to fox trot

22:46.295 --> 22:48.091
or...
I think I'd like to tango.

22:48.091 --> 22:50.836
Ooh. Tango... it's very difficult dance.

22:50.836 --> 22:52.462
Are you saying I can't do it?
Oh, no, no, no.

22:52.462 --> 22:54.763
I know how to tango.
Okay, you guys dance.

22:54.763 --> 22:56.157
We'll watch and learn.
Okay.

22:59.168 --> 23:01.023
Watch those hands, Luc.

23:07.876 --> 23:11.177
Oh! Ooh. Nice.

23:11.177 --> 23:12.925
Great. Oh.

23:30.021 --> 23:31.270
I can do that.

23:39.899 --> 23:40.986
Oh, that's too much.

23:41.863 --> 23:43.444
That was great. Thanks.

23:44.979 --> 23:47.591
Okay, you have to teach
me how to do that. And me.

23:47.591 --> 23:50.033
Yes! Oh, come on. It's fun.

23:50.033 --> 23:51.525
Oh, no, no, you know,

23:51.525 --> 23:53.531
I'm gonna let the smoke settle out there.

23:53.531 --> 23:55.025
Yeah, I agree. Oh, no, no, no.

23:55.025 --> 23:56.088
Come on. Then I won't have a partner.

23:56.088 --> 23:57.706
I don't want to. Come on, Kevin. Please.
Yes, yes, yes.

23:57.706 --> 23:59.407
Come on, Kevin. Don't be so uptight.

23:59.407 --> 24:01.744
By all means, let's tango.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.529
Stand up straight. I am.

24:03.529 --> 24:04.937
Hands behind the back. Right.

24:04.937 --> 24:07.194
Bravo. Same thing.

24:09.189 --> 24:11.617
So which one of you wants to be the man?
I will.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.480
Good. Wait. Why do you get to be the man?

24:13.480 --> 24:15.133
I don't know. Let's both be the man.

24:15.930 --> 24:17.331
Kevin, you're both suited to be the man,

24:17.331 --> 24:20.150
but a tango, it won't work
unless one person lead

24:20.150 --> 24:23.053
and the other person follows. So...

24:23.245 --> 24:24.498
Okay.

24:25.809 --> 24:26.709
Alors...

24:27.845 --> 24:29.555
Okay, it would be a very bad mistake to think

24:29.555 --> 24:32.023
that a woman is less than a man,

24:32.831 --> 24:35.008
in a dance or in life, you know?

24:35.008 --> 24:36.882
Um, the man and woman play their parts,

24:36.882 --> 24:39.158
but... it's equal.

24:39.158 --> 24:41.090
Luc, that was beautifully put.

24:41.091 --> 24:43.289
Yes, it was. Thank you.

24:43.289 --> 24:44.720
All right, boys, make up your mind.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.469
Our arms are getting very tired, okay?

24:46.469 --> 24:49.093
Come on, Kevin. Just be the girl. Please.

24:49.093 --> 24:50.982
Yeah, come on, Kevin.
Man up and be the girl.

24:50.982 --> 24:52.920
Look, I didn't even want to dance.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.162
Oh, my God. You can't do it.

24:55.162 --> 24:56.871
If it's so equal, why don't you do it?

24:56.871 --> 24:58.665
Come on, Kevin. This is
really starting to piss me off.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.206
No, no, no, it's not about being the girl.

25:00.206 --> 25:02.425
It's about following, isn't it?

25:02.425 --> 25:04.334
No one's allowed to make
any of the decisions but you.

25:04.334 --> 25:06.314
I'm supposed to follow
and do whatever you want.

25:06.314 --> 25:07.560
I have never bossed you around.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.985
But somehow, all the important
decisions are always yours... 

25:09.985 --> 25:12.418
where we live, when we have
a baby, how we have a baby,

25:12.418 --> 25:14.390
who takes care of the baby after it's born.

25:14.390 --> 25:15.679
I'm sorry. I'm not having this argument here.

25:15.679 --> 25:17.145
Oh, when we have an argument.

25:17.145 --> 25:19.091
I think the tango was not a good idea.

25:19.092 --> 25:21.657
You know what? I'm  making a decision now.

25:21.658 --> 25:24.290
We're leaving. Good night, everybody.

25:24.291 --> 25:27.324
Luc, thank you for a wonderful
meal. Guys, I'm sorry.

25:27.325 --> 25:29.925
I'm sorry if we spoiled your dance lesson.

25:32.779 --> 25:34.758
Kevin, I think you should follow.

25:39.562 --> 25:41.758
Sometimes, men can be so stupid.

25:42.392 --> 25:44.649
We are all fools when
it comes down to love...

25:46.077 --> 25:47.647
me included.

25:51.860 --> 25:53.694
She wasn't there when I left.

25:55.141 --> 25:55.825
Don't worry, mom.

25:55.825 --> 25:57.479
It was really good for her to have a night

25:57.479 --> 26:00.223
where cancer wasn't the center of her life.

26:00.223 --> 26:01.850
Good for you, too, by the way,

26:01.850 --> 26:03.015
just to hang out with the kids

26:03.015 --> 26:05.897
and not think about it for a bit.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.515
Well, that isn't exactly how it turned out.

26:08.515 --> 26:11.690
Why is that?
Paige was weird all night.

26:11.690 --> 26:13.735
She was moody and quiet, and then...

26:14.169 --> 26:15.812
she asked me about Kitty.

26:15.812 --> 26:17.254
Well, what did she say?

26:17.254 --> 26:18.457
Evidently, she overheard you

26:18.457 --> 26:20.350
talking on the phone saying Kitty is sick.

26:20.350 --> 26:24.276
Oh, God. Did you cover for me?

26:24.276 --> 26:27.586
No, Sarah. I didn't cover for
you. I told them the truth.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.467
Mom, I said that I would handle this.

26:29.467 --> 26:32.050
Well, you didn't handle it.
Well, I was going to handle it

26:32.050 --> 26:34.318
before you sent me over
to the house to handle Luc.

26:34.318 --> 26:37.457
She asked me point-blank, "is aunt Kitty sick?"

26:37.457 --> 26:39.129
You should've seen the look on their faces.

26:39.129 --> 26:41.405
I couldn't lie to them.
They'd never trust me again.

26:41.405 --> 26:44.192
Well, you should've said that I would talk to them.

26:44.192 --> 26:45.344
I'm their mother. Now I'm the one

26:45.344 --> 26:46.501
that has to regain their trust.

26:46.501 --> 26:47.710
And you know how Paige is

26:47.710 --> 26:49.432
when she thinks I'm treating her like a child.

26:49.432 --> 26:50.891
I can't believe you did that, mom.

26:50.891 --> 26:53.972
Sarah, I answered simply
and honestly to a question

26:53.972 --> 26:56.717
from a very scared, very upset little girl.

26:56.717 --> 26:58.643
And I have to tell you, you might think about

26:58.643 --> 27:00.307
Telling your children the truth about

27:00.307 --> 27:02.739
Ol' pepe le pew over at my house,

27:02.739 --> 27:05.923
because if they ask me who he
is, I'm not gonna lie to them.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.507
You know what, mother?
Just don't worry about it.

27:09.507 --> 27:11.517
I will move him out tomorrow. Fine.

27:11.517 --> 27:14.110
Every other member of this
family is very fond of Luc,

27:14.110 --> 27:17.336
including Kitty, because
he's fun and full of life.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.831
But you can't stand that because
you just... you want us all

27:19.831 --> 27:22.805
to handle Kitty's cancer the way that you do.

27:22.805 --> 27:24.901
Well, sometimes, mom, you gotta let up.

27:24.901 --> 27:27.447
Sometimes being vigilant
about every little thing

27:27.447 --> 27:29.605
just doesn't help anybody but you.

27:29.605 --> 27:31.819
You can come pick him up tomorrow morning

27:31.819 --> 27:33.985
anytime you like. I'm up at 6:00.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.697
I'm going upstairs to get Evan. I'll see you then.

27:47.706 --> 27:49.174
David.

27:51.206 --> 27:54.740
I... I'm sorry... what I said about the money.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.018
You know, Holly, I thought we
had that worked out months ago,

27:59.019 --> 28:01.691
but if you feel like I'm not
contributing enough around here,

28:01.691 --> 28:02.836
why don't you just say so?
No, no, no.

28:02.836 --> 28:03.985
And I'll... I'll write you a check.

28:03.985 --> 28:05.865
No, that's not it.

28:07.247 --> 28:09.675
Something's changed.

28:12.279 --> 28:14.336
I... I... I can... I can barely breathe.

28:14.336 --> 28:18.626
Holly, what...
The fund that I invested all my money in?

28:19.758 --> 28:24.185
It was this huge scam.
Oh, no.

28:24.185 --> 28:26.553
I... I was so stupid

28:26.553 --> 28:29.186
to invest my money in this one fund.

28:29.186 --> 28:31.287
I should've known better.

28:31.287 --> 28:35.127
But the returns were so
good, and then I got greedy.

28:35.127 --> 28:36.966
I... I should've asked more questions,

28:36.966 --> 28:38.439
and I should've been more vigilant... 

28:38.439 --> 28:40.166
Wait, wait, wait. What
do you mean, everything?

28:40.166 --> 28:43.245
I... I... I... I mean everything.

28:43.353 --> 28:44.851
I mean, all of my savings,

28:44.851 --> 28:48.442
all of the money that William left me.
It's all gone?

28:48.442 --> 28:50.503
What am I gonna do about the wedding?

28:52.929 --> 28:54.880
I promised her Hawaii.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.183
I told her that she could
have this one perfect day.

28:58.183 --> 29:00.404
Okay, Holly, you still have Ojai.

29:00.404 --> 29:02.636
It's a successful company, Holly. Wh... 

29:02.670 --> 29:04.127
Successful?

29:04.127 --> 29:07.149
It is gonna take us months or even years

29:07.149 --> 29:10.131
to get out from under the
debt that tommy put us in.

29:10.131 --> 29:15.541
All I have are stocks in
the company and this house.

29:18.448 --> 29:20.264
I'm back to where I started.

29:26.637 --> 29:28.149
You look so beautiful in that dress,

29:28.149 --> 29:30.912
it's almost a shame to waste it on just me.

29:32.594 --> 29:33.675
Oh, it's all right.

29:35.433 --> 29:37.711
You know, I only used the
Buckley dinner as a cover

29:37.711 --> 29:39.239
so I could surprise you.

29:40.127 --> 29:42.283
I'm starting to think that my surprise

29:42.283 --> 29:44.474
isn't as good as my cover story.

29:44.474 --> 29:45.481
I don't know.

29:45.481 --> 29:48.062
I guess I was just hoping
for a night without cancer.

29:48.062 --> 29:50.180
Well, everybody at that
event knows you have cancer.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.669
Half of them were at the press conference

29:51.669 --> 29:54.540
when I announced it, and the other
half have sent flowers and e-mails.

29:54.540 --> 29:57.170
So you wouldn't have had a... 
a night without cancer there.

29:57.382 --> 30:00.083
No, you're right. I just... I... I
just had this fantasy

30:00.083 --> 30:01.667
that I would be able to walk in,

30:02.566 --> 30:04.181
you know, looking normal and healthy,

30:04.181 --> 30:08.225
and that we would stay up late
and reminisce and argue policy

30:08.225 --> 30:12.435
and... I wouldn't have to
wear a big "c" on my forehead.

30:13.647 --> 30:15.126
I get that.

30:15.652 --> 30:18.478
And I don't know exactly
how to articulate this

30:18.478 --> 30:21.040
without sounding ungrateful,

30:21.040 --> 30:23.904
but... I don't want special treatment

30:23.904 --> 30:25.656
just because I have cancer.

30:26.163 --> 30:28.000
I wish you would've told me that earlier.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.801
I know. And I'm sorry.
But... but this is how I feel.

30:30.801 --> 30:32.829
I'm telling you now that I... I just... 

30:32.829 --> 30:34.770
I really want to feel normal.

30:34.770 --> 30:37.440
Okay, well, look, I think we're gonna have

30:37.440 --> 30:39.739
a little issue here in about a minute.

30:47.475 --> 30:48.846
Oh, my God.

30:55.022 --> 30:56.929
Oh, God.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.022
Sorry.

31:08.564 --> 31:12.003
It's not like I don't
love your grand gestures.

31:12.003 --> 31:13.866
Do you remember the first
time I brought you up here?

31:14.769 --> 31:16.959
Valentine's day. You'd
never been in a helicopter.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.176
That was the first time we ever had sex.

31:19.176 --> 31:20.331
Okay, just so you know,

31:20.331 --> 31:22.254
that kind of result tends to encourage me.

31:22.254 --> 31:25.965
Right, and just so you know, it wasn't the helicopter.

31:26.898 --> 31:27.943
All right. Okay.

31:27.943 --> 31:30.054
Look, this is gonna take some adjusting.

31:31.088 --> 31:34.212
Aspiring to be normal isn't exactly in my DNA.

31:34.212 --> 31:35.708
You know, where I come from,

31:35.708 --> 31:37.397
the bigger the fight, the more firepower.

31:37.397 --> 31:39.384
I've noticed that.

31:39.384 --> 31:41.559
But here's the thing... 

31:41.559 --> 31:44.316
at the end of the day, all that power...

31:44.316 --> 31:48.160
you still won't be able to
fix it so I don't have cancer.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.965
And it breaks my heart to watch you try.

31:55.267 --> 31:56.908
Tell me what you need...

31:56.908 --> 31:59.950
but make it small and unassuming.

32:02.210 --> 32:04.483
You know what? I know.

32:05.063 --> 32:09.104
Why don't we just go home... watch Evan sleep?

32:09.104 --> 32:12.568
That would be perfect. Good.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.128
All I'm saying is, I think it's dangerous

32:15.128 --> 32:17.296
to use the tango as a metaphor
for our marriage. Okay... 

32:17.296 --> 32:19.785
No, I don't think either one
of us should lead or follow.

32:19.785 --> 32:20.637
Okay, but what if one of us

32:20.637 --> 32:22.612
has a really strong intuition about something?

32:22.612 --> 32:25.092
And what if one of us just needs
the other person to trust him?

32:25.092 --> 32:26.596
What... what if... one of... 

32:26.596 --> 32:28.517
I'm... I'm sorry. I got lost in the pronouns.

32:28.517 --> 32:29.838
Okay, I need you to hear me.

32:29.838 --> 32:31.830
I need you to understand. I am!

32:31.830 --> 32:34.233
I love you, and I want to
start a family with you,

32:34.233 --> 32:35.399
and I want to start soon.

32:35.399 --> 32:38.395
And when the stars align
and suddenly it's possible,

32:38.395 --> 32:41.412
when the universe gives us
an opportunity like this, I...

32:41.412 --> 32:44.801
I just don't think it's very gracious to argue.

32:53.697 --> 32:56.059
We would have to treat her
like any other surrogate.

32:56.059 --> 32:58.812
Of... of course. And she
has to do all the tests...

32:58.812 --> 33:01.011
Okay. Drugs, mental, physical... everything.

33:01.011 --> 33:03.574
Agreed. And she's only the
surrogate. She is not the egg donor.

33:03.574 --> 33:05.367
Okay. And I get all the handbags I want.

33:07.309 --> 33:10.343
Deal. "Deal"?

33:11.158 --> 33:13.593
Come here. Come here.

33:17.712 --> 33:20.006
Don't let it slam... Oh!

33:20.006 --> 33:22.512
Oh, my God. Kitty, what happened?

33:22.512 --> 33:24.277
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah. I just...

33:24.277 --> 33:27.350
I stupidly mentioned that I felt a little dizzy,

33:27.350 --> 33:29.682
and so Galahad here decided to sweep me up.

33:29.682 --> 33:31.479
Oh, well, thank God for Sir Galahad.

33:31.479 --> 33:32.936
But listen, if it's
too much of a gesture,

33:32.936 --> 33:33.930
I could put you down right now.

33:33.930 --> 33:35.229
Oh, that's not a good idea.

33:35.229 --> 33:37.190
Can I get you anything? No.

33:37.190 --> 33:39.535
We're fine. We're fine.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.925
Mom. Mom, are you awake?

33:44.925 --> 33:46.278
Is everything all right?

33:46.278 --> 33:49.369
Cooper had a nightmare.
Oh, honey, come in.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.954
Jump in. Oh.

33:52.988 --> 33:54.945
It's okay, honey. I'm here.

33:54.945 --> 33:57.024
Do you remember what it was about?

33:57.024 --> 33:59.654
I don't remember. No?

33:59.687 --> 34:02.468
It was scary, and I couldn't find you.

34:02.468 --> 34:06.183
Well, I'm right here. You're okay.

34:08.103 --> 34:09.530
Was it about aunt Kitty?

34:09.530 --> 34:12.396
She has cancer. Grandma told us.

34:12.396 --> 34:14.511
She does.

34:14.511 --> 34:15.889
And did grandma tell you

34:15.889 --> 34:18.581
that Kitty has the best
doctors in the whole world,

34:18.581 --> 34:20.521
and they're doing everything
they can to help her

34:20.521 --> 34:22.050
and that she's gonna be just fine.

34:23.576 --> 34:25.130
Are you scared?

34:25.130 --> 34:28.168
I am. I am.

34:28.168 --> 34:31.396
But being scared is no
reason not to tell the truth.

34:31.396 --> 34:35.469
And I should've told you
two the moment you got back.

34:35.469 --> 34:36.900
I'm sorry.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.891
Just sometimes, you know,
I want to protect you from...

34:39.891 --> 34:42.572
from bad things.

34:42.574 --> 34:44.164
Like monsters in my room?

34:44.164 --> 34:47.114
Yes... like monsters in your room.

34:52.268 --> 34:55.735
I'm... I... I'm sorry, Nora. I
didn't mean to disturb you.

34:55.768 --> 34:58.302
Do you need something?
Uh, n... no.

34:58.335 --> 34:59.801
I... I couldn't sleep,

34:59.835 --> 35:01.835
and... I came down to look at the stars.

35:01.868 --> 35:03.835
I see you had the same idea.

35:03.868 --> 35:05.835
Well, please make yourself comfortable.

35:05.868 --> 35:06.807
I have to go to bed.

35:06.807 --> 35:10.604
No, no, no, no, no.
Please don't go. Don't go.

35:15.571 --> 35:16.615
Uh... I think perhaps

35:16.615 --> 35:19.536
it's been a very difficult time for you, eh?

35:19.536 --> 35:21.820
I can't even imagine.

35:21.820 --> 35:25.142
I'm so sorry if, by my
presence here, I made it worse.

35:27.551 --> 35:31.114
Yes. It's... it's a difficult time.

35:32.499 --> 35:35.542
I'm so sorry if... if I've
been unkind in anyway.

35:35.542 --> 35:38.839
I really... I am. It's just...

35:41.050 --> 35:42.655
Been a long day, I guess.

35:42.655 --> 35:45.632
You don't have to apologize.
The French people always say,

35:45.632 --> 35:49.910
"La vie est un oignon que
vous pelez tout en pleurant."

35:49.911 --> 35:51.026
How do I translate that?

35:51.026 --> 35:55.251
Um, life is an onion you peel while crying. So...

35:55.251 --> 35:58.862
Well, I've been doing a lot of peeling lately.
I know.

35:58.862 --> 36:00.695
You know, the French also say

36:00.695 --> 36:03.456
that it's impossible to be sad while dancing.

36:04.723 --> 36:07.400
Oh. Oh, yes. Luc, really,
I... honestly, I don't... 

36:07.400 --> 36:08.913
I don't know how to do this.
Now, Nora...

36:08.913 --> 36:10.888
No. I saw you dancing the box step.

36:10.888 --> 36:12.918
What about a waltz?

36:13.774 --> 36:15.288
Wait. Wait, wait.

36:15.288 --> 36:17.668
Did the French really say this about dancing?

36:18.957 --> 36:20.761
Not really.

36:24.817 --> 36:29.967
And un, deux, trois. One, two, three.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.386
Hi. Hello, everyone.

36:54.419 --> 36:56.386
Morning, guys. How are you? Hello.

36:56.419 --> 36:58.942
Um, Luc, sweetie, would you get me the salsa?

36:58.942 --> 37:00.917
"Sweetie"? We brought muffins.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.886
I'm learning how to make, uh,
how do you call, nor? "Nor"?

37:03.920 --> 37:06.873
Huevos rancheros. It's Kitty's favorite.

37:06.873 --> 37:08.698
Yeah, yeah, I know. How is she?
She's better.

37:08.698 --> 37:10.590
She's tired, but she's better.

37:10.590 --> 37:12.875
Okay, Luc. Here, I want you to try this.

37:12.875 --> 37:16.719
He... he can't get with the
whole eggs/bean combo thing.

37:16.753 --> 37:18.316
Oh, yes. It's not exactly a French flavor.

37:18.316 --> 37:20.855
Hi! Bonjour. It's good? Just in time.

37:20.855 --> 37:22.891
Mom's just been flirting with your new boy... 

37:22.891 --> 37:24.614
Good morning, guys.

37:29.280 --> 37:33.904
Hi, honey. Uh, Paige, Cooper, this is Luc.

37:33.904 --> 37:36.550
Hello. Luc's a good friend of mom's.

37:36.550 --> 37:39.613
Hi. Uh, grandma, um, where's aunt Kitty?

37:39.613 --> 37:40.739
We want to give her our present.

37:40.739 --> 37:43.350
She's upstairs playing with Evan.
Cool. Come on.

37:45.687 --> 37:49.183
Sarah, can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure, mom.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.833
So did you two work out your tango problem?
Yes. Yeah.

37:55.833 --> 37:58.284
So who will be the girl?

37:59.034 --> 38:00.670
Her name's Michelle.

38:00.990 --> 38:02.627
Good for you.

38:04.051 --> 38:05.780
Come on.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.213
Okay, if you're after an apology, you've got it.

38:09.213 --> 38:11.156
No. No. Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I was so mad...

38:11.156 --> 38:14.023
Sarah, no. I need to apologize to you.

38:14.023 --> 38:15.242
I need to apologize to you.
No, mom.

38:15.242 --> 38:17.864
No, mom. I'm telling you that I was wrong.

38:17.864 --> 38:19.575
No, Sarah, you were right.

38:19.575 --> 38:22.753
As it turns out, both you
and Kitty had fun last night.

38:22.753 --> 38:25.044
Kitty feels better, the sky didn't cave in,

38:25.044 --> 38:26.765
and I don't know how to do that.

38:27.686 --> 38:30.079
I'm just so worried about Kitty,
and that's all I know how to do.

38:30.079 --> 38:32.845
And it really doesn't help anyone.

38:32.845 --> 38:35.681
Oh, Sarah, I'm so sorry I treated Luc like that.

38:35.681 --> 38:39.917
He's really... adorable.
Right?
Yes.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.871
And he can stay here as long as he likes,

38:41.871 --> 38:44.753
as long as you like. Thank you.

38:44.753 --> 38:46.532
Now will you let me finish? Yeah.

38:46.532 --> 38:49.836
I wanted to say that you were right to tell Paige.

38:49.836 --> 38:51.424
She asked you point-blank,

38:51.424 --> 38:54.684
and it sounds like you handled it perfectly,

38:54.684 --> 38:58.627
which is why I need to
ask you for some advice.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.886
Really? I'm just glad you still want my advice.

39:00.886 --> 39:02.153
Okay, here it is...

39:03.281 --> 39:07.431
I don't want to ask you
to lie for me about Luc.

39:07.431 --> 39:09.332
But I'm not sure...

39:09.332 --> 39:12.064
How I should tell the kids

39:12.064 --> 39:13.876
or... should I tell them?

39:13.876 --> 39:16.048
Sarah, listen to me.

39:16.937 --> 39:20.790
This is private between you and Luc right now.

39:20.790 --> 39:23.253
Don't tell them. Not till you know what it is.

39:24.764 --> 39:26.960
And by the way, what is it?

39:26.960 --> 39:29.019
I don't know. Is it serious?

39:29.019 --> 39:30.381
I don't know. How long will he be here?

39:30.381 --> 39:32.661
I have no idea. Don't you think it's great and unusual

39:32.661 --> 39:34.719
he followed you here from France?
Do you?

39:34.719 --> 39:36.257
I don't know.
Me neither.

39:37.501 --> 39:40.888
Well, now that we've got that settled, let's eat.

39:40.981 --> 39:44.163
Well, thank you for that little chat, mom.
Yes, sweetheart.

39:44.878 --> 39:47.420
Oh, I love it. Oh, thank you.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.488
It's "when you wish upon a star."

39:49.488 --> 39:52.002
Oh, what do you think, Evan? Do you like it?

39:52.002 --> 39:54.159
We didn't even know you
needed a wish when we got it.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.104
Okay, what's my first wish gonna be?

39:56.104 --> 39:59.846
I wish that I could have a monster hug

39:59.846 --> 40:02.462
from my favorite niece and nephew.

40:02.462 --> 40:03.904
It's gonna come true.

40:03.904 --> 40:07.439
I... is this okay? Does it hurt?
Oh, just the opposite.

40:08.519 --> 40:09.992
You don't look like you're sick.

40:09.992 --> 40:12.842
Well, thank you, Cooper.
I don't feel like I'm sick.

40:12.842 --> 40:15.493
Okay, Dr. Cooper, what's
your wish gonna be?

40:18.509 --> 40:21.969
I'd wish for... food.

40:21.969 --> 40:24.261
Food? Okay.
Me, too. I'm starving.

40:24.261 --> 40:26.312
Okay, food it is. Here we go.

40:26.312 --> 40:30.365
All right. Brunch in bed for everyone.

40:30.365 --> 40:32.341
Oh, my gosh. It worked.

40:33.136 --> 40:34.749
Huevos rancheros.

40:34.749 --> 40:36.225
Mom, you really didn't have to do that.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.249
We were just on our way down.

40:37.249 --> 40:39.037
Well, we had a minor mishap in the kitchen.

40:39.037 --> 40:42.138
Kevin melted the salsa bowl in the microwave.

40:42.138 --> 40:44.498
Now what would you call that in Italian, kids? 

40:44.498 --> 40:48.409
El stupido! Oh! Who's el stupido?

40:48.409 --> 40:50.957
You know, you know, those
buttons on the microwave

40:50.957 --> 40:53.666
Are awfully confusing.
Are they awfully confusing?
