00:40.361 --> 00:42.361

00:46.601 --> 00:48.601
Sorry. I have a son his age.

It's me.

I hope you're well.

Well, I heard the news, so...l suppose you are.

02:23.321 --> 02:25.201
Anyway, I'm here.

02:25.361 --> 02:27.361

(Laughter)

03:39.801 --> 03:41.401
(Woman speaks French)

03:52.441 --> 03:54.441
What are you drawing, Olly?

03:55.041 --> 03:57.841
- It's Daddy!
- Shall we show him?

03:59.001 --> 04:01.641
-(Laughs)
- No, not again!

04:01.801 --> 04:05.081
Why do you always draw me with
such big ears? I don't have big ears, do I?

04:05.241 --> 04:08.041
It's you. It's Daddy Big Ears!

04:08.561 --> 04:10.321
My ears aren't really that big, are they?

04:10.481 --> 04:11.521
Huge.

04:16.401 --> 04:18.281

04:47.321 --> 04:49.201

04:49.361 --> 04:51.481
No work this side of the Channel. Deal?

04:52.961 --> 04:54.441
Deal.

04:59.441 --> 05:01.441
(Engine splutters)

05:07.921 --> 05:09.921
(Ignition fails)

05:17.041 --> 05:18.841
Try again?

05:22.441 --> 05:26.401
WOMAN: How long...
Combien pour la voiture?

05:26.561 --> 05:28.561
- Uh...
- One hour?

05:29.601 --> 05:31.481
Un jour ou deux.

05:31.641 --> 05:33.401
(Groans) One day, maybe two.

05:33.561 --> 05:34.961
Oh, bloody hell!

05:41.161 --> 05:43.241
Erm...bit of a change of plan.

(Replies in French)

06:22.161 --> 06:24.041
Bonjour. Erm...do you speak English?

06:24.201 --> 06:25.441
Yes, hello.

06:25.601 --> 06:27.361
Have you got any rooms?

06:27.521 --> 06:29.481
- We have one room...
- Great, we'll take it.

06:29.641 --> 06:31.561
The television does not work, I'm afraid.

06:31.721 --> 06:32.921
Oh, that's fine.

06:33.081 --> 06:36.641
I would prefer it if you said you must have one
so I could give you this one.

06:38.201 --> 06:40.081
The World Cup is all he thinks about.

06:40.241 --> 06:41.801
Fancy your chances?

06:41.961 --> 06:44.521
- Er...what?
- France against Brazil. France?

06:44.681 --> 06:46.961
Ah, yes, good. Good.

06:48.521 --> 06:49.881
OLLY: Say hello to Mr Foxy!

06:50.041 --> 06:51.921
These are the keys, please, Mr Fox.

06:52.081 --> 06:53.961
- Thank you.
- That's a nice little fox.

06:54.121 --> 06:56.921
I'll bring the fold-out bed for the little one
a bit later.

06:57.081 --> 06:58.721
What's the number, Olly?

06:58.881 --> 07:00.841
- Seven!
- Seven.

07:01.641 --> 07:03.081
I've found it!

07:03.241 --> 07:04.881
- Yeah!
- O-ho!

07:05.041 --> 07:06.481
WOW!

07:08.001 --> 07:10.321
Ooh, it's very big. It's quite a big room.

07:10.481 --> 07:12.481
Good, yeah, I'll get the bags.

07:46.561 --> 07:50.921
Est-ce que vous avez vu ce jeune...garçon?

07:51.081 --> 07:53.081
Vous avez vu ce jeune... Non?

07:53.761 --> 07:55.761
Vous avez vu ce... Non?

08:02.961 --> 08:04.961
Another one of those, please.

08:10.521 --> 08:11.961
Non?

08:15.761 --> 08:17.641
Get off! Let go!

08:18.761 --> 08:20.761
(Slurred) Have you seen this boy here?

08:20.921 --> 08:22.921
Look at the photo, will you?

08:58.041 --> 08:59.521
Mr Hughes?

09:01.281 --> 09:02.801
Laurence!

09:03.481 --> 09:05.961
It's a been a long time.
Last time I saw you was...

09:06.121 --> 09:09.401
Tony...we have had some calls about you.

09:10.601 --> 09:12.481
- Look...
- Complaints.

09:12.641 --> 09:14.921
You are bothering people, you understand?

09:15.081 --> 09:18.041
We have to address these things.
And you being here, it's not...

09:18.201 --> 09:20.201
No, I understand. You're doing your job.

09:20.361 --> 09:22.161
Will you stop this?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.041
No, OK, yeah. I'll stop.

09:33.321 --> 09:34.961
Show me this picture.

09:42.721 --> 09:45.841
That's the scarf Olly was wearing
when he went missing.

09:50.641 --> 09:53.241
This boy was in Châlons.
Do you recognise him?

09:55.321 --> 09:56.561
<i>No.</i>

09:56.721 --> 09:58.721
<i>I'm sorry, I...</i>

10:00.241 --> 10:02.241
You should go home, Tony.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.081
Yeah, I know, I will.

10:57.001 --> 10:58.401
(Grunts)

10:59.121 --> 11:00.601
(Exhales heavily)

11:09.961 --> 11:11.961
Ohh! (Chuckles)

11:12.801 --> 11:15.601
- How are they?
- The colony is well under weight.

11:15.761 --> 11:18.361
I was off on the flow.
They need syrup and water.

11:18.521 --> 11:21.521
- You should never have built that hive.
- (Phone rings)

11:21.681 --> 11:23.561
You're not a carpenter, my love.

11:23.721 --> 11:25.601
Âllo? C'est Julien Baptiste.

11:25.761 --> 11:28.321
Laurence! (Speaks French)

11:54.401 --> 11:56.801
Tony Hughes has gone back
to Châlons du Bois.

11:56.961 --> 11:58.561
Why?

12:00.841 --> 12:02.841
He thinks he's found something.

12:09.001 --> 12:11.401
Laurence says he's being a nuisance, a drunk.

12:11.561 --> 12:13.441
Nobody wants him there.

12:13.601 --> 12:15.601
I can't imagine why.

12:21.001 --> 12:25.721
My honey bees will only survive the winter
if they think there is still a nectar flow.

12:26.441 --> 12:30.601
To live through this cold, they must believe
the world outside the hive is warm,

12:30.761 --> 12:33.961
that there is food, that nothing has changed.

12:35.081 --> 12:41.081
Tony is in Châlons du Bois because there,
he can believe that his son is not gone,

12:41.241 --> 12:45.001
and that somewhere
he is now 13 years old and...

12:47.001 --> 12:49.841
...playing football and starting to think about girls.

12:50.641 --> 12:53.241
You're not thinking about seeing him, are you?

12:55.361 --> 12:57.241
<i>He'! '</i>

12:57.401 --> 12:59.401
(Speaks French, chuckles)

13:01.481 --> 13:03.481
Give me a "bise".

13:27.881 --> 13:29.881
I'm ready.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.321
Mmm!

13:42.041 --> 13:44.321
It's that one! That's the one, 100 per cent.

13:44.481 --> 13:46.361
(Gasps) No!

13:46.521 --> 13:48.881
- The expensive one's the other one?
- Correct.

13:49.041 --> 13:51.241
You liar, you're just being a cheapskate!

13:51.401 --> 13:54.481
Yeah, cos 15 grand's
not enough to spend on your day?

13:54.641 --> 13:57.001
We'll just have to blindfold all our guests.

13:57.161 --> 13:59.161
Hm, interesting!

14:00.881 --> 14:02.321
Oh, look, I found your phone.

14:02.481 --> 14:04.241
Oh, my hero.

14:04.401 --> 14:06.401
Fell into one of the boxes.

14:19.001 --> 14:21.001
<i>TONY". It's me. I hope you're well.</i>

14:23.041 --> 14:25.641
<i>Well, I heard the news, so...I suppose you are.</i>

14:27.041 --> 14:28.801
<i>I came back.</i>

14:30.121 --> 14:32.121
<i>Same room, everything.</i>

14:33.321 --> 14:35.321
<i>TV still doesn't work.</i>

14:37.001 --> 14:38.881
<i>Anyway, I'm here.</i>

14:39.041 --> 14:41.041
<i>I thought you should know why.</i>

14:42.241 --> 14:44.241
<i>I've found something.</i>

15:40.201 --> 15:42.201
(Olly giggles)

15:51.441 --> 15:53.321
(Laughs)

15:54.881 --> 15:56.481
So er...

15:56.641 --> 15:59.561
Sorry, what, the car is...fixed?

15:59.721 --> 16:01.281
Fixé?

16:02.441 --> 16:04.441
OK. Thank you.

16:09.241 --> 16:11.121
(Crowd cheering at match on TV)

16:11.281 --> 16:14.081
And that one is, "I want to swim..."

16:14.241 --> 16:15.921
All done. Car's fixed.

16:16.081 --> 16:17.561
Great. What was it?

16:17.721 --> 16:21.521
He explained it mostly in French
but I wouldn't have understood it in English.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.961
- Swimming tomorrow, Olly.
- Swimming now!

16:24.121 --> 16:25.121
- Where?
- Now?

16:25.281 --> 16:28.001
It's a bit late, love, it's way past your bedtime.

16:30.241 --> 16:32.121
Ooh, there is a pool there.

16:32.281 --> 16:33.321
Please?

16:33.481 --> 16:38.281
But we'd have to go all the way back to the hotel
to get your trunks. There's plenty of holiday left.

16:38.441 --> 16:39.881
Pie-ease!

16:41.281 --> 16:42.801
Pie-ease.

16:45.281 --> 16:47.521
- Swimming it is, sir.
- Yay!

16:47.681 --> 16:51.481
All right, absolutely no longer
than half an hour, you two.

16:51.641 --> 16:52.881
All right?

17:15.961 --> 17:17.601
(Olly giggles)

17:21.601 --> 17:23.761
I'm sinking. Isn't it brilliant?

17:26.401 --> 17:28.601
- One more, one more!
- One more, last one.

17:28.761 --> 17:30.641
One, two...

17:30.801 --> 17:32.201
Whoa!

17:32.361 --> 17:34.081
(Olly laughs)

17:35.001 --> 17:36.641
- (Coughs)
- You all right?

17:36.801 --> 17:38.401
I'm thirsty.

17:38.561 --> 17:40.561
(Mimicking) "Oh, I'm thirsty!

17:41.601 --> 17:44.321
Oh, I'm thirsty!" Come on, we'll get you out.

17:56.321 --> 17:58.201
What would you like to drink?

17:58.361 --> 18:00.241
I think a cup of...

18:00.401 --> 18:02.281
Hm, I know, some hot butter?

18:02.441 --> 18:04.121
No!

18:04.281 --> 18:06.161
It's delicious, I'm telling you.

18:06.321 --> 18:08.201
- What about some frogs' legs?
- No!

18:08.361 --> 18:12.001
- (People cheer)
- Stop being silly, Daddy!

18:12.961 --> 18:14.321
<i>Saw.!</i>

18:15.521 --> 18:17.001
Give me your hand.

18:17.161 --> 18:19.041
Handy, handy. Need your hand.

18:19.201 --> 18:21.201
(People shouting and cheering)

18:23.921 --> 18:25.921
(Shouting intensifies)

18:41.121 --> 18:43.121
One beer, one lemonade.

18:54.561 --> 18:56.561
(Wild cheering)

19:29.641 --> 19:30.881
Olly?

19:32.161 --> 19:33.281
Olly?

19:35.081 --> 19:36.281
Olly?

19:36.441 --> 19:38.441
(Chanting and singing from bar)

19:43.601 --> 19:44.881
Olly?

19:45.041 --> 19:48.521
(People chanting)

19:56.361 --> 19:58.241
Olly, are you here?

19:58.401 --> 20:00.401
Olly? Come on.

20:07.321 --> 20:08.761
Olly?

20:11.081 --> 20:12.961
Olly, are you in there?

20:13.121 --> 20:14.521
Ol?

20:21.281 --> 20:22.881
Olly?

20:24.921 --> 20:26.321
Olly?

20:28.681 --> 20:30.161
Olly?

20:30.321 --> 20:34.281
Have you seen a little boy?
Little boy about this size, running up there?

20:34.441 --> 20:35.601
- No.
- Olly?

20:35.761 --> 20:37.361
Olly?

20:38.721 --> 20:39.881
Olly?

20:40.921 --> 20:42.721
(Panting)

20:44.001 --> 20:45.241
Olly?

20:47.121 --> 20:48.321
Olly!

21:10.241 --> 21:12.241
(Soundtrack masks dialogue)

21:33.641 --> 21:35.641
(Phone rings)

21:40.281 --> 21:42.881
Hey, did you have fun?
Are you on your way back?

21:51.721 --> 21:53.361
What?

21:54.481 --> 21:56.481
(Rowdy shouting)

22:10.841 --> 22:12.321

22:48.121 --> 22:50.321
(Issues commands)

22:58.921 --> 23:03.521
- (Speaks French)
- We don't know what you're saying to us.

23:03.681 --> 23:08.081
- I don't understand what you're...
- He's asking if you would come to the station.

23:08.241 --> 23:09.761
Can you tell me what's happening?

23:09.921 --> 23:13.041
That detective asked me a couple of questions
then just went off and left.

23:13.201 --> 23:16.801
I can bring you to the station myself.
On the way, I can tell you everything I know.

23:16.961 --> 23:21.161
No, we're not going to the station,
we're staying here until you find our boy.

23:21.321 --> 23:23.201
- Olly!
" Hey, Emily,

23:23.361 --> 23:24.521
Olly!

23:24.681 --> 23:26.681
- We can't go to the station.
- Olly!

23:28.201 --> 23:29.881
Emily, Emily, Emily. Come back.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.121
Olly!

23:34.081 --> 23:35.961
(Emily sobs) I don't wanna go!

23:36.121 --> 23:38.121
I don't wanna go!

23:52.041 --> 23:54.041
Mr and Mrs Hughes, I am Georges Deloix,

23:54.201 --> 23:56.921
the juge d'instruction assigned to this case.

23:57.081 --> 23:58.841
Can you tell us exactly what's happening?

23:59.641 --> 24:02.521
You are in excellent hands,
if you'll excuse me now.

24:02.681 --> 24:04.561
I thought you might like a drink.

24:04.721 --> 24:07.001
The machine here is...anyway.

24:07.161 --> 24:09.361
- Who's he?
- The investigating judge.

24:10.001 --> 24:12.881
Not a judge like in England.
He is in charge of the situation.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.561
- I need a photo of your son.
- Why?

24:14.721 --> 24:16.681
(Speaks French)

24:16.841 --> 24:18.961
They are issuing une alerte enlevement.

24:19.121 --> 24:21.121
This is the abduction alert.

24:21.281 --> 24:22.961
(Sobs) Oh, no!

24:23.121 --> 24:25.561
Have you looked everywhere?
He could've just run off.

24:25.721 --> 24:27.801
We must move quickly.
I need a photograph, please.

24:27.961 --> 24:29.521
Châlons is a small department.

24:29.681 --> 24:32.401
The alert makes it a national case
with support from Paris.

24:32.561 --> 24:35.321
This alert will show his photograph
on screens everywhere -

24:35.481 --> 24:37.641
television stations, highways, licensed...

24:37.801 --> 24:39.361
Merci, Relaud.

24:39.521 --> 24:40.921
Wait, wait, can she stay?

24:41.081 --> 24:43.921
- Agent Relaud is not a detective.
- No, she's staying. Stay.

24:45.441 --> 24:47.321
This one. It was taken today.

24:47.481 --> 24:49.441
No, but he's not smiling.

24:49.601 --> 24:51.601
He's always happy.

24:52.201 --> 24:54.201
This one. He's smiling in that one.

25:16.801 --> 25:18.801
(Siren wails in distance)

25:21.721 --> 25:23.121
(Sobs)

25:32.841 --> 25:34.841
<i>TONY". The crowd was...</i>

25:36.521 --> 25:38.521
<i>I mean, he was thirsty.</i>

25:40.161 --> 25:42.361
<i>There was a big crowd watching the game.</i>

25:44.401 --> 25:46.401
<i>I was holding his hand.</i>

25:50.441 --> 25:52.441
I don't blame you, love.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.921
- I'm going out now.
- What? Where?

26:04.081 --> 26:07.401
He might have gone back to places
we were today, somewhere familiar.

26:07.561 --> 26:09.801
That doesn't make any sense, you should stay.

26:09.961 --> 26:11.841
What if he tries to come back?

26:12.001 --> 26:14.561
If he comes back, then you'll be here, it's fine.

26:14.721 --> 26:19.401
I'll go and look for him, and you stay here
and then you'll be here when he comes back.

26:44.721 --> 26:46.121
Olly?

26:56.561 --> 26:58.561
(Cheering and shouting)

27:10.001 --> 27:11.641
(Fizzing and crackling)

27:21.481 --> 27:22.961
Olly?

27:23.801 --> 27:25.201
Olly?

27:30.521 --> 27:32.081
Olly?

27:42.081 --> 27:43.961
(Fireworks whistling)

27:44.121 --> 27:46.121
(Crowd chanting)

27:58.081 --> 28:00.081
(Yells drunkenly)

28:06.161 --> 28:08.161
(Barks commands)

29:13.401 --> 29:15.441
(Announcement in French)

29:43.801 --> 29:45.201
Hi, Tony.

29:46.801 --> 29:48.081
Julien.

29:50.801 --> 29:51.881
Sit.

29:57.521 --> 29:59.521
(Julien sighs)

30:00.321 --> 30:02.321
Thanks for calling.

30:03.121 --> 30:05.121
I heard you were back.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.921
Excusez-moi? Vin rouge.

30:12.801 --> 30:14.441
How's your leg?

30:15.241 --> 30:18.641
I'm not sure if it stopped hurting
or I just got used to the pain.

30:18.801 --> 30:20.801
Either way, I don't notice any more.

30:26.361 --> 30:28.361
You should know, you being here again...

30:29.241 --> 30:31.601
Well...people are talking.

30:31.761 --> 30:33.201
So what?

30:33.361 --> 30:35.481
After the things that were written about me?

30:37.241 --> 30:40.881
I mean only, you must know
how uncomfortable this makes people.

30:42.161 --> 30:43.441
Right.

30:44.201 --> 30:47.121
My son being taken
was such an inconvenience for them.

30:50.721 --> 30:53.001
- For those who live here...
- Life goes on.

30:53.161 --> 30:55.041
One way or another, yes.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.121
For us all.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.881
Yes. Who is he?

31:11.041 --> 31:12.921
I've no idea.

31:13.081 --> 31:15.361
Sylvie, the manager of Hotel Eden,

31:15.521 --> 31:18.801
two weeks ago,
she posted this photo on Facebook.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.721
A friend of hers on Bastille Day
in Châlons du Bois.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.161
I knew the moment I looked at it.

31:24.321 --> 31:26.521
Look, see the boy in the background there?

31:26.681 --> 31:28.681
Look what he's wearing.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.201
- A scarf.
- Oliver's scarf.

31:36.241 --> 31:38.041
A coincidence, perhaps.

31:38.201 --> 31:41.961
No, no, no. I don't mean it's the kind of scarf
Oliver was wearing on that night.

31:42.121 --> 31:43.601
I mean it's exactly the one.

31:43.761 --> 31:48.121
Emily had it made for him,
with his initials on it - look, "ONH".

31:51.001 --> 31:53.361
You're telling me
a scarf with my son's initials on,

31:53.521 --> 31:57.601
shows up in the same town from
which he was taken, and it's a coincidence?

31:59.641 --> 32:01.521
It's his, Julien, huh?

32:01.681 --> 32:03.521
That means someone left it somewhere.

32:03.681 --> 32:06.281
Someone found it,
and somehow it ended up with this boy.

32:06.441 --> 32:08.961
- If we can trace it back...
- "We"? We can't do anything.

32:09.121 --> 32:10.961
I'm retired, you have no authority here.

32:11.121 --> 32:13.561
- If there is any news...
- The police will pass it on?

32:13.721 --> 32:16.601
Yeah, I told Laurence,
she couldn't have been less interested.

32:16.761 --> 32:19.881
Maybe Ziane would give a shit,
if he wasn't rotting in jail?

32:20.041 --> 32:22.681
Look, I came here as a courtesy, as a friend.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.561
You need to stop this. You need to go home.

32:25.721 --> 32:27.081
This...

32:27.241 --> 32:29.241
This isn't good for you.

32:33.161 --> 32:35.161
You're lucky.

32:35.921 --> 32:39.561
All those years as a detective,
and you've just switched it off...

32:39.721 --> 32:41.721
washed your hands of it.

32:43.761 --> 32:45.761
Well, good for you.

32:54.121 --> 32:56.321
And don't say you were here as my friend.

32:59.681 --> 33:01.361
We were never friends.

33:04.521 --> 33:05.721
Take it up with him.

33:08.801 --> 33:10.801
(Door slams, Julien sighs)

33:14.441 --> 33:19.001
I shouldn't have bothered with the movers,
James, you've put them to shame all day.

33:19.161 --> 33:20.721
I really appreciate it.

33:20.881 --> 33:22.321
I don't mind.

33:22.481 --> 33:25.601
Hey, I was thinking that,
since I'm paying the removal men,

33:25.761 --> 33:27.841
I ought to pay you something as well.

33:28.001 --> 33:30.841
- Really? Awesome!
- Are you spoiling him again?

33:31.001 --> 33:33.561
- I don't spoil him.
- Oi!

33:36.281 --> 33:38.281
- All clear upstairs?
- Yep.

33:43.201 --> 33:45.721
Ems, erm...you left these in the attic.

33:46.521 --> 33:48.521
I don't know if you forgot it, or...

33:51.521 --> 33:53.521
No, no, I haven't forgotten.

33:55.081 --> 33:57.361
Do you want me put it with the other boxes?

34:13.801 --> 34:15.801
They're just... They're just things.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.161
They're not really him, are they?

34:18.960 --> 34:20.440
<i>No.</i>

34:27.641 --> 34:31.440
We should get the guys to drop it off
at Queen Charlotte's - at the children's ward.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.281
Right.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.841
Right.

35:01.121 --> 35:03.121
(Exhales heavily)

35:09.841 --> 35:11.841
(Phone rings)

35:20.641 --> 35:22.641
Mrs Hughes?

35:24.681 --> 35:26.681
<i>(Emily breathes heavily)</i>

35:28.841 --> 35:29.921
Emily?

35:42.481 --> 35:44.481

35:45.521 --> 35:47.521
(Footsteps approaching)

35:49.521 --> 35:51.001
CELIA: You're up late.

35:52.561 --> 35:55.761
You should never have introduced me
to shopping online.

35:58.041 --> 36:00.041
Tony really did find something.

36:02.841 --> 36:04.281
I'm so transparent?

36:05.881 --> 36:07.481
To me, always.

36:07.641 --> 36:09.281
Well...

36:10.001 --> 36:11.441
he thinks he has.

36:11.601 --> 36:16.081
I didn't promise to help him. I told him to go
home, try to forget Châlons du Bois.

36:16.881 --> 36:18.881
He won't.

36:19.721 --> 36:20.761
<i>No.</i>

36:20.921 --> 36:22.561
Any more than you.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.801
<i>(Announcement in French)</i>

38:40.401 --> 38:42.001
- Excuse me...
- Mum.

38:43.681 --> 38:45.401
Tony.

38:45.561 --> 38:47.521
I don't know what to say, I'm so sorry.

38:47.681 --> 38:49.561
Oh, sweetheart.

38:49.721 --> 38:51.721
- Oh, Dad.
- Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

38:53.921 --> 38:55.561
There's police everywhere.

38:55.721 --> 38:59.081
I mean, do they have any leads,
any idea what might have happened?

38:59.241 --> 39:02.241
No, there's a guy from Paris called Baptiste
in charge of it.

39:02.401 --> 39:06.001
- But no one's telling us anything.
- These are my parents, Robert and Penny.

39:07.001 --> 39:08.401
My thoughts are with you.

39:08.561 --> 39:11.881
Oh, and this is...Alain. He's Sylvie's husband.

39:12.041 --> 39:15.681
Sylvie has been very kind and said
that we can stay here for as long as we like.

39:15.841 --> 39:17.321
And of course, no charge.

39:17.481 --> 39:20.001
Oui. Yes, of course.

39:20.881 --> 39:24.361
And I'm sorry your room is not ready yet
so can I offer you a cup of tea?

39:24.521 --> 39:26.241
PENNY: No, we'll wait in our room.

39:29.881 --> 39:31.281
He says um...

39:31.441 --> 39:34.521
Olly could have run off and got lost
but it's unlikely.

39:35.201 --> 39:36.961
What is likely?

39:37.921 --> 39:39.961
He thinks he could still be alive.

39:40.121 --> 39:41.921
He thinks that um...

39:43.081 --> 39:45.561
...we'd already have found him if he was um...

39:49.321 --> 39:51.321
You know, cases like this...

39:53.081 --> 39:55.161
...and I see it all the time in court...

39:56.721 --> 39:58.841
...it's very often someone you know...

40:01.121 --> 40:03.121
...someone with a grudge.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.241
You don't think that...

40:07.401 --> 40:09.401
after what we did...

40:11.441 --> 40:13.441
No, that was a long time ago.

40:14.441 --> 40:15.961
Not that long.

40:20.801 --> 40:22.681
We should go inside.

- Monsieur Ziane.

40:46.401 --> 40:48.401
"Chamartaines". What does this mean?

40:50.721 --> 40:54.001
I think you know what it means
or else you wouldn't be here.

40:57.801 --> 40:59.801
- You're a journalist?
- I am.

41:01.521 --> 41:03.441
What do you know about Chamartaines?

41:04.801 --> 41:06.121
Enough.

41:11.321 --> 41:13.841
I want information on the Oliver Hughes case.

41:18.281 --> 41:19.961
Why do you ask me?

41:20.121 --> 41:23.601
They have brought in some expert from Paris
to tell me what to do.

41:23.761 --> 41:27.881
And they give me an agent as a partner, no
experience as a detective but the family like her.

41:28.041 --> 41:30.761
You're still part of the investigation, though.

41:36.681 --> 41:40.801
Tell me what you know
and no one will ever hear about Chamartaines.

45:01.921 --> 45:03.441
Well, I did.

45:05.161 --> 45:07.041
I knew you believed me.

45:07.201 --> 45:09.201
Did you find out anything?

45:13.241 --> 45:15.321
I found out who the boy in the photo is.

45:16.601 --> 45:17.601
How?

45:17.761 --> 45:20.041
As you know, this was taken on Bastille Day.

45:20.201 --> 45:22.201
Some old colleagues in the department

45:22.361 --> 45:26.841
helped search every available image
of the celebrations here in Châlons du Bois -

45:27.001 --> 45:31.961
social networking sites,
publications, whatever we could find online.

45:32.121 --> 45:33.321
Look.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.481
We found this.

45:36.161 --> 45:40.881
From the license plate, a rental,
we found the family.

45:41.041 --> 45:42.601
That's the boy!

45:42.761 --> 45:45.721
What did they say, did they see Olly?
What did they say?

45:45.881 --> 45:47.401
They were here on holiday.

45:47.561 --> 45:50.561
They say they bought the scarf
from a second-hand shop.

45:50.721 --> 45:52.721
Do you believe them?

45:53.681 --> 45:55.961
I have no reason to assume they are lying.

45:56.801 --> 46:00.561
In the meantime,
it can't hurt to explore the story.

46:04.841 --> 46:09.041
- You've been going to charity shops?
- I have visited four already. Nothing.

46:09.201 --> 46:11.081
Yeah, but if we can find the shop...

46:11.241 --> 46:14.481
If we can find that, we can find out
who handed the scarf in...

46:14.641 --> 46:17.601
There are three other second-hand shops
in this area.

46:17.761 --> 46:22.121
And if indeed one of them received this scarf,
it was in all likelihood many years ago, so...

46:23.001 --> 46:24.841
one step at a time, hm?

46:32.761 --> 46:34.761
MARK: (Softly) One, two, three...

46:35.401 --> 46:37.401
Madame, breakfast is served.

46:40.561 --> 46:42.081
What?

46:43.881 --> 46:45.561
WOW!

46:45.721 --> 46:47.161
Look at this.

46:47.321 --> 46:49.521
Just thought for the first day in our new house.

46:49.681 --> 46:51.561
Your new house, our old one.

46:51.721 --> 46:55.321
- Dad was just gonna go to McDonald's.
- Yeah and what's wrong with that?

46:55.921 --> 46:57.921
That's very sweet of you.

46:59.041 --> 47:00.601
I made the pancakes too.

47:00.761 --> 47:02.761
Yeah, don't touch the pancakes.

47:04.841 --> 47:08.161
Aren't you two gonna have anything?
No, we're just gonna watch you.

47:08.321 --> 47:09.961
And steal some pancakes.

47:16.761 --> 47:18.761
It's lovely of you. Both of you.

47:19.201 --> 47:23.441
I'm just going to nip to the loo,
I'll be back in one second, OK?

47:23.601 --> 47:26.321
Don't be too long, cos we'll eat all the pancakes.

47:29.601 --> 47:31.201
(Sniffles)

47:33.001 --> 47:34.841
(Sobs)

47:57.801 --> 48:00.081
Your records are very thorough, madame.

48:00.641 --> 48:04.921
Well...l started this shop after I lost my husband.

48:06.441 --> 48:09.681
- I would sift through his things in the wardrobe.
- Is it in there?

48:09.841 --> 48:11.721
You cannot live that way forever.

48:11.881 --> 48:13.761
So I began to sell his things.

48:13.921 --> 48:15.801
All his clothes.

48:15.961 --> 48:17.521
But I never forgot.

48:19.121 --> 48:22.801
You know, that knowledge,
that your life's possessions...

48:22.961 --> 48:27.361
they they have a life of their own,
even beyond you.

48:28.801 --> 48:31.161
Since then I take people's names.

48:32.481 --> 48:35.361
And when someone makes a purchase,
I send a postcard.

48:35.521 --> 48:39.401
"Your pink teddy bear has been sold
to a little girl, for five euros."

48:42.641 --> 48:44.561
Yeah, you probably think me silly.

48:45.641 --> 48:48.641
You know, I was a police officer for 40 years.

48:48.801 --> 48:51.121
I know better than to make such judgments.

48:58.401 --> 48:59.521
Tony.

49:01.241 --> 49:02.681
It's there.

49:06.681 --> 49:08.561
"Yellow scarf - ONH."

49:08.721 --> 49:10.721
Look, here.

49:12.121 --> 49:16.601
And the name and the address of the woman
who brought it in four years ago.

49:18.441 --> 49:21.761
It's been here, four years, while we...

49:26.161 --> 49:27.721
Have I helped?

49:29.081 --> 49:32.721
Oh, you've... you've been a great help, madame.

49:33.641 --> 49:35.641
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

49:36.761 --> 49:38.201
(Speaks French)

49:42.881 --> 49:44.681
Thank you.

49:47.121 --> 49:48.681
You're welcome.

51:19.161 --> 51:20.721
Bonjour, madame.

52:04.241 --> 52:05.761
Mrs Hughes.

52:05.921 --> 52:07.921
I'm not here to give an interview.

52:11.841 --> 52:15.321
Well, if you're not here to give an interview,
then why did you call me?

52:19.521 --> 52:21.521
Tony's gone back.

52:23.001 --> 52:24.561
To Châlons du Bois?

52:24.721 --> 52:26.721
He thinks he's found something.

52:27.961 --> 52:29.801
And you're telling me this because...?

52:29.961 --> 52:32.561
You're a dog with a bone.
I know you'll follow him out there.

52:32.721 --> 52:35.441
And when you do,
I want to know what he's found...

52:36.161 --> 52:38.161
what he thinks he's found.

52:38.921 --> 52:40.441
I don't do errands, Mrs Hughes.

52:40.601 --> 52:43.281
If you don't want to know
what he's doing out there, don't go.

52:43.441 --> 52:45.481
If you want to know, why don't you just ask him?

52:45.641 --> 52:48.361
Well, I'm asking you, aren't I?

53:02.241 --> 53:04.241
I'll call you when I know something.

53:27.601 --> 53:29.001
(Speaks French)

53:29.161 --> 53:31.481
- What's she saying?
- She remembers you.

53:34.241 --> 53:35.641
And the scarf?

53:36.161 --> 53:37.881
Does she recognise the scarf?

53:58.601 --> 54:01.521
(Speaks French)

54:11.321 --> 54:12.401
(Calls out in French)

54:14.281 --> 54:17.761
(French dialogue)

54:27.281 --> 54:29.161
What's going on?

54:29.321 --> 54:31.601
- L'écharpe...
- L'écharpe? The scarf?

54:32.361 --> 54:33.961
(French)

54:38.321 --> 54:41.121
- (Speaks French)
- Tell me. What's she saying?

54:41.281 --> 54:43.281
(Speaks French)

54:44.881 --> 54:48.281
Four years ago she had her house decorated,
emptied the cellar

54:48.441 --> 54:51.561
and several things
were taken to the second-hand shop.

54:52.481 --> 54:54.961
Oliver's scarf must have got mixed up in there.

54:55.121 --> 54:56.601
Well, how, how?

54:56.761 --> 55:01.641
In July 2006, she and her family were away.

55:03.001 --> 55:05.001
The house was empty.

55:07.481 --> 55:08.801
I think...

55:10.401 --> 55:12.601
...perhaps your son was taken here.

55:16.721 --> 55:18.241
Here?

55:22.481 --> 55:24.561
(Exchange in French)

55:26.361 --> 55:28.361
(Soundtrack masks dialogue)

55:40.121 --> 55:42.121
Tony, nothing is certain.

55:44.081 --> 55:48.881
Yeah, I just need to...
splash some water on my face or something.

55:49.041 --> 55:51.081
(Exchange in French)

56:04.201 --> 56:05.841
Monsieur?

56:27.041 --> 56:28.921
Tony, I understand.

56:29.081 --> 56:31.081
But we need to go.

56:31.881 --> 56:34.761
Monsieur? Monsieur?

56:41.481 --> 56:43.481
Tony, I will make some calls.

56:43.881 --> 56:46.281
I will do this through the proper channels.

56:52.241 --> 56:54.121
Please, trust me.

56:54.281 --> 56:56.281
(Woman calls out)

57:03.281 --> 57:05.281
He was here.

57:21.961 --> 57:23.521
JULIEN: What?

57:46.121 --> 57:47.481
Olly.

57:47.641 --> 57:49.641
(Hyperventilates)

57:51.681 --> 57:53.161
Olly!

57:54.305 --> 58:00.265
