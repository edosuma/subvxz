00:01.335 --> 00:02.795
Previously,
on When Calls the Heart...

00:02.837 --> 00:03.796
How much
are you asking?

00:03.838 --> 00:04.797
Depends on who buys it.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.005
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

00:06.047 --> 00:07.048
Cody's happy here.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.509
This is where he belongs.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.510
Am I in your story?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.928
There is a Mountie.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.513
Rosemary LeVeaux,

00:12.554 --> 00:13.848
will you be my wife?

00:13.889 --> 00:15.766
Of course I will.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.602
[♪♪♪]

00:37.162 --> 00:38.873
Now, about
the linens...

00:38.914 --> 00:40.958
Hmm?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.083
Blue or white?

00:42.125 --> 00:42.918
For what?

00:42.960 --> 00:43.627
[chuckles]

00:43.752 --> 00:44.712
The reception, silly.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.087
White tablecloths
are standard,

00:46.129 --> 00:47.381
but if we went
with blue...

00:47.422 --> 00:49.550
they bring out
the color in my eyes.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.676
What are we gonna
match with my eyes?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.093
Something bloodshot?

00:52.135 --> 00:53.136
[chuckles] Lee.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.722
You really do need
to get some rest.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.557
Well, I would love that, but
there just isn't enough time,

00:56.598 --> 00:59.100
with everything on
your wedding "to-do" list.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.061
Consider it a labor of love.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.149
[♪♪♪]

01:15.617 --> 01:18.537
Now. About the dinner,
for the reception...

01:18.579 --> 01:19.747
Mm...

01:19.788 --> 01:21.122
Isn't that something

01:21.164 --> 01:23.083
you should talking
to Abigail about?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.544
I thought we'd have
the food sent in

01:25.586 --> 01:27.337
from the Grand Hotel
in Union City.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.130
There's nothing grand
about the food from Union City,

01:29.172 --> 01:30.215
trust me.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.175
I love Abigail,
and you know that,

01:32.217 --> 01:34.135
but... is she...

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
skilled enough

01:36.179 --> 01:37.138
to put together

01:37.180 --> 01:39.140
a whole wedding banquet?

01:39.182 --> 01:41.602
Just tell her what you want,
and I'm sure she can handle it.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.562
There have been
storms all over.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.188
I wouldn't want
to take the chance

01:45.230 --> 01:47.274
of the food not
arriving on time.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.943
How about this one?

01:48.984 --> 01:50.569
Well, that's--

01:53.196 --> 01:55.490
...An improvement.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.786
It's definitely
a-- a-a--

01:59.703 --> 02:01.747
A baby step
in the right direction.

02:01.789 --> 02:02.873
You don't like it.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.666
Oh, Elizabeth,

02:04.708 --> 02:07.044
I do appreciate you offering
to do the place cards,

02:07.086 --> 02:08.295
I do, but...

02:08.336 --> 02:12.173
it's just so... school-teachery.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.592
It just needs a little flair.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.177
The letters need to dance
across the paper.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.597
Maybe you could try
working on your apex,

02:18.639 --> 02:19.681
and your arches.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.182
Do you need a new nib?

02:21.224 --> 02:22.893
There is nothing wrong
with my nib!

02:22.935 --> 02:24.937
Oh. Well...

02:26.187 --> 02:27.773
Then this is...

02:27.815 --> 02:30.358
this will be
just fine.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.571
Let me try again.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.701
What are you doing?
It was fine!

02:39.743 --> 02:42.788
We don't want our wedding
to be "fine," Lee!

02:42.830 --> 02:45.707
We want our wedding
to be fantastic.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.584
Well, let's just hope
we have some friends left

02:47.626 --> 02:50.004
to attend
our "fantastic" wedding.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.133
[♪♪♪]

03:04.267 --> 03:05.978
[sighs]

03:06.020 --> 03:08.438
Goodnight, boy.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.067
[pounding at door]

03:18.824 --> 03:20.241
Can I help you?

03:20.283 --> 03:23.202
I could use
a hot cup of coffee.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.245
Mom!

03:24.287 --> 03:26.123
In the flesh.

03:26.165 --> 03:27.833
[laughs]

03:29.877 --> 03:32.420
[♪♪♪]

03:53.316 --> 03:55.569
So you rode all the way
from Aberdeen on horseback?

03:55.610 --> 03:56.987
Through the bad weather?

03:57.029 --> 03:58.780
Well, it's not
like I'd melt.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.699
You know, there's a thing
called a "stagecoach" now.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.742
Maybe you've
heard of it.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.285
You always did
like to sass.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.453
I'm just saying,

04:05.495 --> 04:07.288
a stage might have been
a little safer.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.083
Well, weather made
a mess of the schedule.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.375
And besides,

04:10.417 --> 04:13.045
it's been way too long
since I've seen you, son.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.171
So,

04:14.337 --> 04:16.173
this is where you live?

04:16.215 --> 04:17.298
It's not so bad.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.884
Mm-hmm.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.302
And, uh...

04:21.344 --> 04:24.264
where's the young lady
you were writing me about?

04:24.305 --> 04:25.682
That's really
why you came, isn't it?

04:25.724 --> 04:27.475
Can't a mother miss her son?

04:27.517 --> 04:28.977
[chuckles] And here we go.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.062
What is that supposed to mean?

04:30.104 --> 04:31.396
It's an old trick
of yours.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.440
Asking a question
instead of giving me an answer.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.316
Do I do that?

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
[sighs] I surrender.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.029
[laughs]

04:40.363 --> 04:41.740
It's getting late.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.367
Let's just talk more
in the morning.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.535
Just point me
toward the hotel.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.579
No, the front desk
closes at 10:00,

04:47.621 --> 04:48.580
you're staying here
for the night.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.748
Take my bed.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.332
I'm gonna bunk
in the cell.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.334
It's good to see you, son.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.294
You too, Ma.

04:59.299 --> 04:59.925
How was your trip?

04:59.967 --> 05:01.260
Oh, endless.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.510
Some of the roads
were washed out,

05:02.552 --> 05:03.804
so the coach had to
take the long way home.

05:03.845 --> 05:04.888
Guess what?

05:04.930 --> 05:06.848
Becky won
the scholarship contest.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.558
Wow, that's great news!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.351
Can't say
I'm surprised, though.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.353
Hey, Cody!
You want to play kickball?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.355
Is it okay, Miss Abigail?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.690
Oh, I don't know
where you get all that energy

05:15.732 --> 05:17.734
after such a big trip,
but have fun.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.283
It's good to see you.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.701
Truth be told, I missed you.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.955
Well, as long as
we're telling the truth,

05:29.997 --> 05:32.457
I missed you, too.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.752
If you're not too tired
from your trip,

05:35.794 --> 05:37.963
I was thinking we could
go riding tomorrow.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.756
I'm thinking
it's a date.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.261
Told ya I'd deliver.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.971
That's why I hired you.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.182
Did anybody get hurt?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.558
Let's just say the guy knew
I meant business.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.854
He was three months behind
on a loan I gave him.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.524
I believe
this is what we agreed upon.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.400
Plus a bonus.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.487
Got any more work?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.405
Soon enough.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.616
Pleasure doing
business with you.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.413
[footsteps receding]

06:16.459 --> 06:18.419
You've got a loose
button. Here.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.796
Take that off.
Let me sew it for you.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.048
Nah. I'll fix it later.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.008
Jack, how is anyone
going to respect you

06:23.050 --> 06:24.551
with a loose button?

06:24.592 --> 06:26.427
Well, if I lose their respect
over a button,

06:26.469 --> 06:28.013
I never had it.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.431
[chuckles] You still
got that cowlick.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.976
Ma, I can dress myself
without your help.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.477
Well, there's
that sass again.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.394
[sneezes]

06:35.436 --> 06:36.813
You're not getting
sick, are you?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.857
Ahh. You know
I don't get sick.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.067
It's that dog.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.943
Rip?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.070
No. He had
a bath yesterday.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.112
Well, he needs
another one.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.572
[Rip howls]

06:45.613 --> 06:47.282
[door opens]

06:48.575 --> 06:49.784
Hello.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.036
Hi.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.453
Hi.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.997
This is my mother,
Charlotte Thornton.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.833
Ma, Elizabeth Thatcher.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.335
Well, hello.

06:58.377 --> 07:01.462
Mrs. Thornton, it is
such a pleasure to meet you.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.090
Jack, I can't believe
you didn't tell me

07:03.131 --> 07:04.465
that your mother
was coming for a visit.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.550
Well,

07:05.592 --> 07:06.634
I didn't know.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.303
I, uh, like to
surprise him, Lizzie.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.222
Keeps him on his toes.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.223
It's Elizabeth, Ma.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.515
Oh, that's all right.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.601
You can call me whatever
you like, Mrs. Thornton.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.643
Hmm.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.811
Why don't you both

07:16.853 --> 07:18.021
come to over to my place
for dinner tonight?

07:18.063 --> 07:19.356
I'll make shepherd's pie.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.899
You're going to cook
for my mother?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.525
Is that a problem?

07:22.567 --> 07:23.568
Not at all.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.028
And I'll help.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.405
Oh, but, Ma,
you can't cook either.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.655
What do you
mean by "either"?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.199
Did I say "either"?

07:29.241 --> 07:31.118
[chuckles]
I meant "often."

07:31.159 --> 07:32.660
Neither of you
cook very often,

07:32.702 --> 07:36.123
so I thought that I would
treat us to dinner at Abigail's.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.124
[sneezes]

07:37.165 --> 07:38.125
Bless you.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.001
She thinks
she's allergic to Rip.

07:40.043 --> 07:40.961
Someone
needs a bath.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.337
Rip or Jack?

07:42.379 --> 07:44.172
[Charlotte laughs]

07:44.214 --> 07:45.506
You know what?

07:45.548 --> 07:47.508
I have plenty of space
at my house.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.510
Why don't you come
and stay with me?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.430
Oh, no, we wouldn't
want to impose.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.973
It's no imposition.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.892
Well, in that case,
I'll go get my bags.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.064
Hmm...

08:01.106 --> 08:02.523
You think
I can't cook?

08:02.565 --> 08:04.651
Oh, no. You--
You've gotten much better.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.945
Then why would you say that?
Now your mother's gonna think

08:06.987 --> 08:08.863
I can't even
prepare a decent meal.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.325
Well, then you'd
have that in common.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.368
But you don't, because...

08:13.410 --> 08:16.455
you're a much better cook
than she is.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.001
[♪♪♪]

08:26.589 --> 08:28.549
I want you
to release the doves

08:28.591 --> 08:30.551
just as Lee and I
leave the church.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.013
Maybe we could
throw rice instead.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.098
Hickam.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.391
What aren't
you telling me?

08:36.433 --> 08:39.102
The lock on the cage

08:39.144 --> 08:41.562
wasn't closed all
the way last night.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.274
I'm afraid
your birds flew away.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.234
[gasps] Oh, no.
All of them?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.486
All except for one.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.570
I think he's
too fat to fly.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.531
Well, you put him
on a diet

08:51.572 --> 08:53.325
and you find the rest of
those naughty little birds.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.993
I need solutions,
not problems!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.577
Yes, ma'am.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.662
Rosie LeVeaux.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.080
Is that you?

08:59.122 --> 09:01.666
Charlotte Thornton!
[laughing]

09:02.959 --> 09:05.253
Oh, ho, ho!

09:05.295 --> 09:07.214
It's been ages!

09:07.255 --> 09:08.256
Yes, the last time
I saw you,

09:08.298 --> 09:09.674
you and Jack had
just gotten engaged.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.092
Oh, dear.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.635
I hope there are
no hard feelings.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.472
Hard feelings?
You and Jack were oil and water.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.598
You were never
meant to be together.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.184
I guess you knew
before we did.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.811
Chalk it up
to mother's intuition.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.647
Well, I finally did find
the man of my dreams.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.233
We're getting
married on Saturday.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.901
Congratulations, honey.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.110
He's one lucky man.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.320
I'm the lucky one.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.864
So much to chat about. Come!

09:32.906 --> 09:34.699
I have to admit,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.743
I wasn't sure how
I felt about seeing you.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.453
I should never have
asked you to choose

09:38.495 --> 09:40.497
between Bill and me.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.040
You really mean that?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.624
I do.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.419
I just hope
that you'll forgive me.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.128
As long as
it doesn't happen again.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.671
It won't, I promise.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.466
You know, Henry,
I've been thinking.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.843
We both have
unhappy memories here.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.430
Maybe it's time for us
to get a fresh start.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.014
What did you have in mind?

09:58.056 --> 10:00.641
I know it may sound
like an impossible idea,

10:00.683 --> 10:03.228
but what if we started over
somewhere else?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.938
Far away from Hope Valley?

10:04.979 --> 10:08.483
I've already put a bid
on that property I showed you.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.527
You could withdraw it.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.660
[Footsteps]

10:19.702 --> 10:20.870
Your guest room is very nice.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.997
I'm so glad
you're comfortable.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.332
And I can see

10:24.374 --> 10:27.377
that you do not like
dusting any more than I do.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.921
Actually, I just dusted
this afternoon.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.298
Of course you did.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.673
Aren't you worried about

10:32.715 --> 10:34.301
making a mess
of your pretty blouse?

10:34.342 --> 10:35.969
Oh, it's
nothing fancy.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.887
I sew my own
clothes.

10:37.929 --> 10:38.930
Oh.

10:38.972 --> 10:39.973
Do you sew?

10:40.014 --> 10:42.683
I once sewed a pillowcase.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.185
That's nice.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.188
Oh, what's that?

10:47.230 --> 10:48.231
Paprika.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.232
Jack likes pepper.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.275
I didn't know that.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.110
Well, now you do. Here you go.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.699
Isn't that a lot of pepper?

10:58.741 --> 11:00.660
Oh, you can never have
too much pepper.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.874
Now, all that's missing
is my special ingredient.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.042
Love?

11:08.084 --> 11:10.670
Lard.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.048
Here we go.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.850
[♪♪♪]

11:24.934 --> 11:29.439
Now, here's the list of entrees
I was thinking of.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.358
Four different choices?

11:31.399 --> 11:32.733
You don't think
that's enough?

11:32.775 --> 11:36.737
Rosemary, could it be
that you're trying too hard?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
I just want everything
to be perfect.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.241
People are coming
to your wedding

11:40.283 --> 11:41.993
because they care about
you and Lee,

11:42.035 --> 11:44.663
not because you're serving them
some fancy dinner.

11:44.703 --> 11:45.704
They want to celebrate

11:45.746 --> 11:47.248
the promise
of your future together.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.333
They want to celebrate

11:48.375 --> 11:50.251
the love you have
for each other.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.545
Oh, Abigail.

11:51.586 --> 11:55.298
That's so...
dear of you to say.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.757
It's true.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.385
Then I won't worry
about the food.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.596
You have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.684
So, about the bridal shower...

12:05.724 --> 12:06.767
What about it?

12:06.809 --> 12:07.894
Don't you think

12:07.935 --> 12:09.270
you and Elizabeth
should start decorating?

12:09.312 --> 12:10.938
There isn't much time left.
It is tomorrow night.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.233
And we're going to
decorate tomorrow.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.192
But are you sure
that's enough time?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.443
I just want everything to be--

12:16.444 --> 12:18.737
And it will be.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.493
Okay.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.453
This is
really delicious.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.038
[Charlotte] You've hardly
eaten a mouthful.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.290
That's just...
it's really filling.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.208
But good.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.626
Mm.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.294
It's really good.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.339
Your mother put lard
in my shepherd's pie.

12:36.381 --> 12:40.719
Lard is what makes it
stick to the shepherd's ribs.

12:40.759 --> 12:44.347
I-I had a, uh,
quite a big lunch, so...

12:45.515 --> 12:46.849
And speaking of lunch,

12:46.891 --> 12:48.059
I think we should head
to the settlement tomorrow,

12:48.101 --> 12:49.852
before lunch,
maybe just after breakfast.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.396
[Charlotte]
What settlement?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.481
It's just south of town,
by the river.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.024
Couple of dozen families
just moved there.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.317
[Elizabeth] They're renting
the land there

12:56.359 --> 12:58.278
until they can afford
to build permanent homes.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.820
They really
don't have very much.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.281
Sounds like a tough life.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.865
It is.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.910
Elizabeth is trying to set up
a school there for the children.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.829
Why can't they come
to the school in Hope Valley?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.998
It's too far, it's
a three-hour walk from here.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.834
The first school I taught
was in a tent.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.253
Jack told me
you were a teacher.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.465
Well, I haven't been in
a classroom in a long while.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.049
I miss the kids.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.842
Well, you should come tomorrow.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.638
I wouldn't want to
impose on your mother.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.846
[Charlotte] I'd love to.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.848
If Lizzie doesn't think
I'd be in the way.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.517
You could never
be in the way, Ma.

Not in a million years.

Good morning, Sunshine.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.454
It's 5:00
in the morning.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.871
I made coffee.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.081
[exhales]

13:52.123 --> 13:53.708
I've been up since 4:00.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.917
I couldn't find
a washboard.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.877
That's because
I don't have one.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
How do you
wash your clothes?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.881
I pay Mrs. Miller
to do it.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.800
Oh.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.009
With my schedule,

14:03.050 --> 14:03.968
it isn't always easy
to get the laundry done,

14:04.010 --> 14:05.886
and the Millers
are new in town.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.888
They could really use
the extra money.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.182
Well, I do it myself.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.558
I don't really care for the idea

14:10.600 --> 14:13.311
of someone else handling
my personal items.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.479
Oh, I wash
my own unmentionables.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.896
You know,

14:15.938 --> 14:18.899
I never could figure out
why a person would bring them up

14:18.941 --> 14:21.486
when they can't mention
what they are.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.570
[chuckles]

14:22.612 --> 14:24.656

14:26.282 --> 14:28.909
I really do love
this time of day.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.911
A person can get so much done

14:30.953 --> 14:33.039
before the rest of the house
gets underfoot.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.915
I bet your mom
felt the same way.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.626
Well, she did have help.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.918
You kids pitched in?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.463
I meant the servants.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.717
Yeah, Jack told me
about your life in Hamilton.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.926
Must've been very comfortable.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.512
Maybe
too comfortable.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.723
It's part of the reason
why I moved to Hope Valley,

14:49.764 --> 14:51.432
to do things for myself.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.933
Except your laundry.

up at the Silverton Mine.

We needed to get the wagon
on the road in a hurry,

in case the rain
washes out the trail.

Gorgeous.
And there's lots of it!

15:19.001 --> 15:20.253
Are you sure
you have enough time

15:20.294 --> 15:22.046
to make
all four dresses?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.464
Four? I thought

15:23.506 --> 15:25.341
you said there were
three bridesmaids.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.967
Did I?
No. I meant four.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.011
So hard to keep track
of all the details.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.430
Clara's very good
at sewing.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.265
I might be able
to convince her to help.

That's a wonderful idea.

If it were up to me,

15:42.191 --> 15:44.277
we would get married
right this second.

the power vested in me.

I promised to build
Rosemary a gazebo

Isn't that

our wedding is the last
thing on his mind.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.056
No, no,
I didn't say that.

Did I say that?

I didn't say that.

to any good marriage.

And the forgetting,
apparently.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.197
It's important
to be open and honest

16:30.239 --> 16:32.533
and lay everything on the table
as soon as possible.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.161
We agree on
just about everything,

Yep. Two peas

with diapers.

what's in those diapers?

17:44.981 --> 17:46.399
if we just give
them the chance.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.027
You don't know the first thing
about our way of life.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.654
I'm a teacher,

17:51.696 --> 17:53.531
and I know how important it is
for children to learn.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.533
Miss Thatcher
taught me to read!

17:55.575 --> 17:58.118
It's easy,
once you know how.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.663
I'm sorry. We're not
setting up a school here.

18:00.705 --> 18:01.748
There just isn't time

18:01.789 --> 18:03.541
for the children
to sit for lessons.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.085
They said they would
read us a story.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.049
All right. One story.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.217
Then it's time
for your chores.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.720
Maggie, you stay
with your brother.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.930
She likes to wander off.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.973
I'll keep
an eye on her.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.100
Come along.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.565
[sighs] You know...

18:27.607 --> 18:29.650
I grew up dirt poor.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.193
Then you know
what it's like for us.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.737
I do.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.907
And the best thing I ever did
was learn to read and write.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.199
It's why I became a teacher.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.452
I wanted to give back
what I had been given.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.495
That young lady means well,

18:41.537 --> 18:43.497
but she doesn't understand
people like us.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.499
[Jack] Ma'am?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.167
May I tell you
about that young lady?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.544
Elizabeth Thatcher,

18:48.586 --> 18:50.964
she's worked wonders for
the children of Hope Valley,

18:51.005 --> 18:52.172
and if she's willing
to help your children,

18:52.214 --> 18:55.468
I think you should thank
your lucky stars.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.177
There's not a teacher alive

18:57.219 --> 18:59.179
who is as dedicated
and as talented as she is.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.473
Except your mother.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.682
[chuckles]

19:01.724 --> 19:03.309
If you want a better life
for your children,

19:03.350 --> 19:05.728
take her up on her offer.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.276
[♪♪♪]

19:16.864 --> 19:19.199
I'll say one thing
about this kind of work, Roy.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.660
Makes me miss home.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.202
Yeah, I'm not crazy about
sleeping in a soggy tent

19:22.244 --> 19:23.412
with nine other guys either.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.289
How long are you
here this haul?

19:25.331 --> 19:27.041
Three weeks.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.542
That's a long time away
from your wife and son.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.210
How about you?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.212
Three more days
and I'm heading back.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.213
Not looking forward

19:33.255 --> 19:34.214
to a three-hour
wagon ride,

19:34.256 --> 19:35.967
but when I get home,

19:36.009 --> 19:38.177
you know, if I have two pennies
to rub together,

19:38.218 --> 19:41.221
I may even treat Nancy
and Harper to dinner in town.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.936
I came as soon
as they left the bank.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.228
I thought you'd want
to know right away.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.271
Slow down.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.442
Who left the bank?

19:53.484 --> 19:55.235
They said they were
government auditors.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.822
I didn't like the kind
of questions they were asking.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.239
What questions?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.826
It was the implication
of misuse of funds.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.620
Now, I told them all allocations
go through your office,

20:04.662 --> 20:06.998
but they insisted
on seizing the records.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.208
You did the right thing
by coming to me.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.252
If there's anything else
I can do...

20:12.294 --> 20:14.547
Don't worry about it.
I'll straighten this out.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.589
Maybe I should, uh--

20:15.631 --> 20:17.299
[sharply] I said,
I'd handle it.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.219
Good afternoon.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.016
[♪♪♪]

20:30.104 --> 20:32.899
"But he just
couldn't find Frisky.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.652
But when Nathaniel climbed
the stairs to his cozy bedroom,

20:36.694 --> 20:39.072
there was Frisky,
his treasured companion,"

20:39.113 --> 20:41.032
sitting at the foot of the bed,

20:41.074 --> 20:43.201
happily wagging his tail."

20:43.242 --> 20:44.660
The end.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.703
Will you read us
another story?

20:45.745 --> 20:46.913
There's another book
in the series,

20:46.954 --> 20:48.831
but it's back
in Hope Valley.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.666
Why don't you
come for a visit?

20:50.708 --> 20:52.752
-Can we?
-Please?

20:52.793 --> 20:54.670
We'll see what
the other mothers have to say.

20:54.712 --> 20:58.007
[♪♪♪]

21:00.134 --> 21:01.510
Feels nice to be
out of the kitchen

21:01.552 --> 21:02.887
for a while.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.889
Rosemary has certainly
kept me busy.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.306
Well, if you ever
need a break,

21:06.348 --> 21:07.307
just let me know.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.643
Florence
came by the cafe

21:09.685 --> 21:11.812
and asked
an interesting question.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.564
Yeah? What did
she want to know?

21:13.606 --> 21:17.317
Well, she asked if--

21:17.359 --> 21:20.404
well, if you and I
were officially courting.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.700
What'd you say?

21:24.742 --> 21:27.494
What would you
have said?

21:30.039 --> 21:33.333
Well, I would have
told her the truth.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.335
I would have said yes.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.713
That's what I said.

21:37.755 --> 21:38.839
[laughs]

21:38.881 --> 21:42.301
Well, now that
it's official...

21:42.342 --> 21:43.636
why don't you let me
take you to dinner

21:43.677 --> 21:45.345
at the saloon
tomorrow night?

21:45.387 --> 21:46.388
Oh, I can't
tomorrow night.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.473
It's spaghetti night.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.766
It's Cody's
favorite meal

21:48.808 --> 21:51.102
and we play games
after dinner.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.271
Okay.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.397
Unless you'd like
to join us?

21:55.439 --> 21:57.900
Thought
you'd never ask.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.194
[♪♪♪]

22:03.363 --> 22:05.241
Oh! What a lovely sachet.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.201
Thank you, Florence.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.202
I read that
fresh-smelling clothes

22:08.244 --> 22:09.787
will always
make a man happy.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.664
Oh?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.373
I'll keep that in mind.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.168
Elizabeth, wasn't Charlotte
going to join us tonight?

22:15.209 --> 22:16.961
Oh, she said
she was exhausted.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.129
Poor dear.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.672
She's probably tired
from her long ride.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.341
I don't blame her at all
for needing some rest.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.592
Mrs. Thornton is...

22:23.634 --> 22:25.845
colorful, isn't she?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.554
How are you two
getting along?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.098
I hear she's
staying with you.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.474
Oh...

22:30.516 --> 22:33.477
She is a wonderful house guest.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.230
And very creative
in the kitchen.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.606
And...

22:37.648 --> 22:40.276
an early riser.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.448
I'll go get the punch
and cookies.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.409
You know what?
I'll help you.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.411
[men laughing]

22:51.453 --> 22:53.413
A toast!
To the man of the hour.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.957
-Ah!
-Here, here.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.501
Any man marrying Rosemary
deserves more than an hour.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.418
True!

22:58.460 --> 22:59.712
And a poker game,
I think.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.505
Well, let's find us
a table, shall we?

23:01.547 --> 23:02.422
Let's.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.466
Jack?
As you know, uh,

23:04.508 --> 23:06.344
each groom needs
a best man,

23:06.384 --> 23:08.762
and I was thinking
that, um...

23:08.804 --> 23:09.889
I'd be honored, Lee.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.098
Ahh! I'm assuming
you know what it entails

23:11.140 --> 23:12.308
to being a best man?

23:12.350 --> 23:13.976
The rings, of course.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.729
And making sure Rosemary
doesn't drive you crazy?

23:16.770 --> 23:17.730
That's pretty
much it, yep.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.481
What's the game, boys?
Stud or draw?

23:19.523 --> 23:21.441
[Charlotte]
I call stud.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.820
That is, if you gents
can use another player.

23:24.862 --> 23:28.157
Well, we always have room
for a pretty lady.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.658
Gentlemen...

23:29.700 --> 23:32.203
I would like to introduce you
to my mother,

23:32.245 --> 23:33.453
Charlotte Thornton.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.454
[overlapping] Mother?

23:34.496 --> 23:37.457
[♪♪♪]

23:37.499 --> 23:39.001
Well, it's nice
to finally meet you.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.418
It's good
to meet you.

23:40.460 --> 23:41.545
My name's Bill Avery.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.421
I worked with
your husband years ago.

23:43.463 --> 23:45.383
He always had very fond
things to say about you.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.759
Well, Mr. Avery,

23:46.800 --> 23:48.886
from what my husband told me
about your poker skills,

23:48.928 --> 23:52.598
it looks like I stand to do
very well this evening.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.516
[laughter]

23:59.355 --> 24:00.522
Rosemary...

24:00.564 --> 24:01.982
is everything all right?

24:02.024 --> 24:05.319
You don't seem like
your normal bubbly self.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.987
Everything's
just perfect.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.446
Why wouldn't it be?

24:08.488 --> 24:10.490
No reason.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.701
[exhales shakily]
Oh, Elizabeth...

24:12.743 --> 24:14.494
I'm usually the one
with all the answers.

24:14.536 --> 24:15.662
I'm the one with
the advice column.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.915
I just don't know what to do.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.417
About?

24:19.457 --> 24:21.127
Lee! We are
so perfectly matched,

24:21.168 --> 24:22.586
we agree on everything.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.713
[sighing]
But now there's...

24:24.755 --> 24:26.590
children.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.427
What about
children?

24:29.467 --> 24:31.511
I don't think
we agree about them at all!

24:31.553 --> 24:33.013
About how to raise them?

24:33.055 --> 24:34.890
The whole concept.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.892
In general.

24:36.934 --> 24:37.977
Rosemary.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.396
You and Lee
love each other, right?

24:40.438 --> 24:41.355
You want to make
each other happy?

24:41.397 --> 24:44.066
Completely, and totally.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.152
Well, when two people feel
that way about each other,

24:46.193 --> 24:47.611
they find answers,

24:47.653 --> 24:49.613
and finding the answers
brings them together,

24:49.655 --> 24:52.032
it doesn't pull them apart.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.701
That's very wise.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.246
Maybe you should
take over the advice column.

24:57.288 --> 25:00.582
Once I'm a married woman,
I might not have the time.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.752
[laughs] I doubt
I could do it justice.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.545
You having problems
of your own?

25:05.587 --> 25:07.340
[hushed] Charlotte.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.300
We're so different.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.427
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

25:11.469 --> 25:14.554
When God made that woman,
He broke the mold.

25:14.596 --> 25:15.848
There's not a person
on this planet

25:15.889 --> 25:17.599
who has anything
in common with her.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.893
[both laugh]
She's very...

25:19.935 --> 25:21.770
Unique.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.856
"Unique." Yes.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.816
Let's go with that.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.319
[both laughing]

25:29.487 --> 25:31.238
Jack, you should've warned us
that your mother's beauty

25:31.280 --> 25:33.073
belied her poker face.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.409
She is full
of surprises.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.743
I am sorry to have
cleaned you out

25:36.785 --> 25:37.995
at your own
bachelor party.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.746
It's all right.
I always respect a winner.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.665
Thank you.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.459
Anyone want
to place a wager

25:43.501 --> 25:45.336
on a friendly
game of darts?

25:45.378 --> 25:47.587
[Jack] I think it's time
to call it a night.

25:47.629 --> 25:48.672
[Charlotte] Kill-joy.

25:50.757 --> 25:51.717
[men sighing]

25:51.758 --> 25:52.718
Good night.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.552
Good night.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.264
[Elizabeth, laughs]
I can't believe

25:57.306 --> 25:59.016
your mother ditched
the bridal shower

25:59.058 --> 26:00.976
and crashed
the bachelor party.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.186
She said
she was tired.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.063
Must've gotten
a second wind.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.524
Sometimes, I don't believe
she's really your mother.

26:06.606 --> 26:07.441
Why not?

26:07.483 --> 26:09.818
You and she
are so different.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.112
She's a survivor.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.198
It wasn't easy having
Tom and me so young,

26:14.240 --> 26:16.200
raising us by herself,

26:16.242 --> 26:18.576
and holding down a job.

26:19.828 --> 26:20.996
Look, I want
to thank you

26:21.038 --> 26:22.915
for spending
so much time with her.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.624
It's my pleasure.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.544
Sure about that?

26:28.462 --> 26:29.755
We're heading out
for a duck hunt.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.340
Want to come?

26:31.382 --> 26:33.259
Sorry. I have patrol.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.386
Darn. I have school.
Maybe next time.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.137
Did you get that button fixed?

26:37.179 --> 26:38.180
I'll do it tonight.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.639
Don't forget.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.640
Ma.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.435
Ahem.

26:42.476 --> 26:44.353
And you need
a hair cut!

26:44.395 --> 26:46.939
Mom.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.316
You care about her
very much, don't you?

26:49.358 --> 26:51.651
Yeah. When she's not
driving me crazy.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.529
[laughing]

26:56.115 --> 26:57.657
Hey, Clara.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.286
How would you like
to go for a fancy dinner

27:00.327 --> 27:01.328
next Friday night?

27:01.370 --> 27:02.955
I got plenty
of cash now.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.124
No thanks.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.000
What about Saturday?

27:07.042 --> 27:09.086
I know where that cash
came from, Jesse.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.130
You're working
for Mr. Gowen.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.048
[laughs] So?
He's the mayor.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.841
That doesn't
make him a good man.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.927
Why don't
you like him?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.387
It's a long list.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.680
Let's just say
he's not trustworthy.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.682
He paid me. I'd say
that's pretty trustworthy.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.102
What did
he pay you to do?

27:25.144 --> 27:28.688
I took care of some
personal business for him.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.648
I collected a debt.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.610
What did you have
to do to collect?

27:32.650 --> 27:34.027
Nothing.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.695
If you want us
to see each other,

27:35.737 --> 27:36.905
you can't work for him.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.991
Well, then maybe
I'll have find someone else

27:39.032 --> 27:39.992
to take to dinner.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.660
Maybe you should.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.500
[footsteps receding]

27:47.541 --> 27:49.667
[Dottie] You said
you had a favor to ask?

27:49.709 --> 27:50.710
[Bill] I do.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.129
It's not an easy one.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.422
The bank has hired me

27:53.464 --> 27:55.090
to check into
some possible problems

27:55.132 --> 27:57.009
with the town's
finances,

27:57.050 --> 27:58.344
which means
I have to find out

27:58.385 --> 28:00.220
if Gowen's been up
to anything.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.389
I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.516
Well, I won't
know that

28:03.557 --> 28:04.891
until I look at
his private ledgers--

28:04.933 --> 28:07.727
the ones
in his office.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.855
You're not
asking me to...

28:09.896 --> 28:11.398
to steal them,
are you?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.690
No, no, no, no.
I would never ask you

28:12.732 --> 28:13.817
to do something
like that,

28:13.859 --> 28:15.944
but the townspeople
do deserve to know

28:15.986 --> 28:17.737
if their mayor
has betrayed them.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.615
So... [sighs]

28:19.657 --> 28:22.075
I'm just wondering
if there's anything

28:22.117 --> 28:23.743
that you feel
you could share

28:23.785 --> 28:25.996
that might be of help.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.501
Have you ever noticed

28:30.543 --> 28:32.752
there's a barrel
outside the mayor's office?

28:32.794 --> 28:34.213
I can't say
as I have.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.548
There's no reason
you would.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.841
But there
is something there

28:37.883 --> 28:39.051
that might be of use

28:39.092 --> 28:40.760
to someone
who wants to know

28:40.802 --> 28:43.389
whether the mayor
has been honest or not.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.393
But you didn't
hear it from me.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.654
Recess isn't
over yet, girls.

28:58.696 --> 28:59.779
We want you
to skip rope with us.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.114
I'll tell you what,

29:01.156 --> 29:03.659
I'll join you as soon
as I'm finished with this.

29:03.701 --> 29:04.951
What are you doing
with those books?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.120
I'm giving them to the children
at the settlement.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.497
I thought they didn't
know how to read.

29:08.539 --> 29:11.500
Well, hopefully, these books
will help them learn.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.419
Why don't they have
books of their own?

29:14.461 --> 29:16.547
They don't have
as many things as we do.

29:16.589 --> 29:19.799
Their parents don't even have
enough money for proper houses.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.552
Their families
traveled a long way

29:21.594 --> 29:23.095
to start new lives here.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.971
There wasn't room
to bring much with them.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.809
I have some books at home
they can have.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.353
I have some dolls.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.855
Miles has some tin soldiers
he doesn't play with anymore.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.816
That's a wonderful idea.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.444
Why don't you go ask
the other children

29:38.485 --> 29:40.654
if they have anything
they'd like to give as well?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.615
Is this gonna be sort of
like Kindness Week?

29:42.656 --> 29:46.826
It's the sort of kindness
we should show people every day.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.417
[Rosemary]
That's three more regrets.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.085
I can't believe

29:55.127 --> 29:57.588
people are canceling because of
a silly thing like the weather.

29:57.630 --> 29:58.838
There's been some flooding
in the hills.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.133
This one's from
my dearest friend from New York,

30:01.174 --> 30:03.051
Penelope Calloway.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.095
[gasps] Oh!

30:05.137 --> 30:06.305
Can you believe it?

30:06.346 --> 30:09.015
She isn't coming
because she's having a baby!

30:10.225 --> 30:11.851
It's difficult to travel
in her condition.

30:11.893 --> 30:12.852
Honestly?

30:12.894 --> 30:14.854
She should've planned ahead.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.399
I'm gonna go see Dottie

30:17.441 --> 30:19.818
about the bridesmaids'
dresses. [huffs]

30:20.902 --> 30:24.573
There sure is a big fuss
about this wedding.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.032
Well, when it comes
to Miss LeVeaux,

30:26.074 --> 30:28.201
there's always a big fuss.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.995
What's so special
about a wedding anyway?

30:30.036 --> 30:31.037
A wedding

30:31.079 --> 30:32.872
is a celebration
of marriage,

30:32.914 --> 30:34.416
it's a lifelong commitment
of love

30:34.458 --> 30:37.043
that two people
give to each other.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.378
Doesn't get more special
than that.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.589
How do you know if
you want to marry each other?

30:40.631 --> 30:41.881
It's something
you feel in your heart.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.592
And then what happens?

30:43.634 --> 30:45.803
Then a man will ask a lady
to be his wife.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.887
But then she has to say yes.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.516
Can pastors get married?

30:51.517 --> 30:52.892
From what I've been told.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.728
So when are you going to
ask Miss Abigail?

30:54.770 --> 30:55.729
[Gasping]

30:55.771 --> 30:57.022
Cody.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.482
Do you have to
pray about it?

30:58.524 --> 30:59.983
Cody, I'm praying right now.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.738
[chuckles]
Eat up, young man.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.120
Whoa.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.914
[Bill] River's
running pretty fast.

31:14.956 --> 31:15.915
Shouldn't be a problem
for the settlement,

31:15.957 --> 31:16.916
as long as
there's no more rain.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.919
Mm. Or a log jam
in the mountains.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.380
I'll ride up there later
and take a look.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.840
I'll go with you.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.758
I want to check the mine
and make sure the road's clear.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.925
Good idea.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.010
Bill?

31:27.052 --> 31:28.470
Did Jenkins talk to you
about Gowen?

31:28.512 --> 31:30.180
Yeah, he said there's
some irregularities

31:30.222 --> 31:31.931
with the town's accounts.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.975
I told him my hands are tied
without a court order.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.143
Can't make Gowen

31:35.185 --> 31:36.603
show me his books
without a subpoena.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.313
You knew Jenkins would
come to me, didn't you?

31:38.355 --> 31:40.357
You don't have to
play by the rules.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.984
Just the way I like it. Hyah!

31:43.985 --> 31:45.945
[Frank] I had such
a good time last night.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.031
I feel like I should
apologize for Cody.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.075
Ah, you don't need to apologize.
Keep the change.

31:50.116 --> 31:51.869
I'll see you soon?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.210
More coffee, Charlotte?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.587
Thank you.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.797
Oh, I wish I could make it
half as good as you do.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.340
I have a secret ingredient.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.383
Lard?

32:06.425 --> 32:07.967
Who puts lard in coffee?

32:08.009 --> 32:09.428
Oh. Just a wild guess.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.012
[chuckles]

32:11.054 --> 32:14.850
So... what's going on
between you and the Pastor?

32:14.892 --> 32:16.602
Well, how do you know
anything's going on?

32:16.643 --> 32:18.645
Just another wild guess.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.980
Frank and I are courting.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.442
How's your little boy
feel about it?

32:23.483 --> 32:25.277
Oh, Cody loves Frank.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.862
My boys were not that easy.

32:26.904 --> 32:29.072
So you never met anyone
after your husband died?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.990
I tried.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.159
In the end,
I didn't want to rock the boat.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.036
Is that the real reason?

32:35.078 --> 32:37.372
Maybe it is...

32:37.414 --> 32:39.165
maybe it isn't.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.626
I fell in love
with Jack's father

32:40.667 --> 32:43.253
from the moment I met him.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.713
I figured something like that

32:44.755 --> 32:46.673
only comes along
once in a lifetime.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.593
Maybe it does,
maybe it doesn't.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.011
It's too late now.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.973
It's never too late
to find true love again.

32:55.014 --> 32:58.017
Spoken like
someone who has found it.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.937
[chuckles]

33:01.563 --> 33:02.773
[Elizabeth] I'm so glad

33:02.815 --> 33:05.191
the children were able
to visit Hope Valley.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.192
Me too.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.653
Can I pet Rip?

33:07.694 --> 33:09.237
Of course you can.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.158
Can he play fetch?

33:13.199 --> 33:14.993
That depends on his mood.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.495
Let's find out.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.664
Come on. Come on, boy.
Come on, Harper.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.790
Thanks
for the baseball.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.124
You want to play catch?

33:21.166 --> 33:22.876
Sure!

33:25.462 --> 33:27.213
It was kind of you
to send a wagon for us.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.048
Ever since
you read them

33:29.090 --> 33:31.050
that story about
Nathaniel and the dog,

33:31.092 --> 33:33.762
they've been asking
about coming here.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.307
Would you like
some more tea, Brownie?

33:37.349 --> 33:38.433
He says yes,

33:38.475 --> 33:40.059
and he would like
a cookie, too.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.061
He's a very nice bear.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.439
Would you like him
to stay with you for awhile?

33:44.481 --> 33:45.732
Could he?

33:49.695 --> 33:50.904
If you like,

33:50.946 --> 33:52.698
I'd be happy to make a trip
to the settlement

33:52.739 --> 33:53.949
once a week for a lesson.

33:53.991 --> 33:56.075
I could bring some of
the children with me.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.076
I don't know.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.078
There's-- There's
so much to do.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.498
Once a week wouldn't take
much time away from the chores.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.042
They're getting
along so well.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.005
[kids laughing]

34:10.131 --> 34:11.466
I don't know about this.

34:11.508 --> 34:14.011
I thought you said
you wanted a fresh start?

34:14.052 --> 34:16.221
But leaving
town so soon...

34:16.262 --> 34:17.597
Well, you know me, Nora.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.058
I get something in my mind,
I don't want to wait.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.478
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.104
No.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.147
You know,
I thought a lot

34:26.189 --> 34:27.482
about that you said--

34:27.524 --> 34:30.027
about this town,

34:30.068 --> 34:33.071
and about the bad blood
between Bill and I.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.074
I think we both know
that's never going to end.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.994
This could be
a new beginning for us.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.371
I just don't see
any point in putting it off.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.380
Oh, good day.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.007
Good day.

34:53.132 --> 34:53.967
I hear you had

34:54.009 --> 34:55.761
some visitors
today at school?

34:55.802 --> 34:58.680
I know you spoke
with Mrs. Lawson.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.766
She didn't just
magically change her mind.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.225
No, it wasn't me.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.102
It was Jack.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.311
Jack?

35:05.353 --> 35:07.940
Oh, he gave her
a piece of his mind

35:07.981 --> 35:09.399
after she turned
you down.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.109
He did?

35:11.150 --> 35:14.780
My son thinks
the world of you.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.573
Well, I don't know
about all that.

35:16.615 --> 35:17.699
Well, he does,

35:17.741 --> 35:20.201
and he is not
an easy one to impress.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.245
Like his mother?

35:23.204 --> 35:26.165
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.794
[laughing]

35:31.755 --> 35:34.007
Hello? Two more.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.009
Oh! Oh...

35:36.051 --> 35:37.552
How lovely.

35:37.594 --> 35:40.179
A gift from my Aunt Gertie
in Minnesota.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.181
Which is strange...

35:42.223 --> 35:44.684
because I thought
she had passed on.

35:44.726 --> 35:45.852
Well, maybe it is Aunt Gertie.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.521
Oh. You're such a tease.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.689
Does all this stuff

35:49.731 --> 35:51.066
really have to be
in my office, though?

35:51.108 --> 35:53.151
Where else are we going
to put everything?

35:53.192 --> 35:54.611
And I certainly
can't ask people

35:54.653 --> 35:55.695
not to send gifts.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.280
They're so happy for us.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.615
Except perhaps
Penelope Calloway.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.867
Did I tell you she's not
even coming to the wedding?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.201
Yes, you mentioned that
15 times--

36:02.243 --> 36:03.244
now 16 times--

36:03.286 --> 36:04.245
but it reminds me--

36:04.287 --> 36:06.205
she did send...

36:06.247 --> 36:08.207
a telegram.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.168
"Dear Rosemary--

36:10.209 --> 36:11.503
George and I wish
we could be there

36:11.544 --> 36:12.629
to celebrate
your special day."

36:12.671 --> 36:13.630
[dubiously] Hmm.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.214
"I thought you would
like to know

36:15.256 --> 36:16.257
we had a little girl.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.300
We wanted her name

36:17.342 --> 36:19.218
to reflect beauty,
kindness, and grace,

36:19.260 --> 36:20.971
so we named...

36:22.097 --> 36:24.223
her
Rosemary Calloway."

36:24.265 --> 36:25.558
Well, how about that?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.435
They named their daughter
after you.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.939
I don't know
quite what to say.

36:30.981 --> 36:33.108
Sometimes,
that's a good thing.

36:33.150 --> 36:36.486
A little girl...
named Rosemary.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.239
And they want her to grow up
to be just like me.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.825
Who can blame them?

36:42.492 --> 36:43.869
Oh, Lee.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.206
I think this might be
the best gift of all.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.126
[chuckles]

36:52.544 --> 36:54.462
[door opens]

36:54.504 --> 36:55.922
[Charlotte]
What's with this town?

36:56.840 --> 36:59.258
They roll up the sidewalks
at 9:00.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.552
The cafe's closed,

37:00.593 --> 37:02.804
your lady friend's working
on her storytelling,

37:02.846 --> 37:05.473
and I cannot find a poker game
to save my life.

37:05.515 --> 37:08.018
Well, then I guess I got you
all to myself tonight.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.603
[chuckles]
Did you get that button fixed?

37:10.645 --> 37:13.398
Yeah, Ma.
I got the button fixed.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.113
Ma...

37:20.155 --> 37:22.782
can we talk about something?

37:22.824 --> 37:25.077
You name it.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.288
Thank you.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.707
[exhales heavily]

37:30.749 --> 37:32.834
I want to know what
you think about Elizabeth.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.544
What kind of
a question is that?

37:34.586 --> 37:35.545
Would you just
answer, please?

37:35.587 --> 37:36.963
The real question

37:37.005 --> 37:39.799
is what the heck is goin' on
between the two of you?

37:39.841 --> 37:42.094
What's that supposed to mean?

37:42.135 --> 37:44.470
Jack, you have been seeing
Lizzie for a long time now.

37:44.512 --> 37:48.391
I'd say it's time to ride
or get out of the saddle.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.895
Yeah, well, things haven't
always been easy between us.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.312
They should be.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.606
Yeah, they should be,

37:54.647 --> 37:56.315
but you and I both know
life isn't like that.

37:57.192 --> 38:00.112
I just want you to be happy.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.281
Sometimes, I wonder.

38:03.322 --> 38:04.323
Oh!

38:04.365 --> 38:06.451
There's that sass again.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.578
Come here.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.414
I love you, you know that?

38:11.456 --> 38:13.332
Oh, I love you, too, son.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.169
I love you.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.298
[♪♪♪]

38:22.508 --> 38:25.303
[gravel crunching]

38:35.814 --> 38:37.732
[deadbolt clicks]

38:37.774 --> 38:40.235
[♪♪♪]

38:45.782 --> 38:48.493
[♪♪♪]

38:57.210 --> 39:00.338
[Elizabeth] Oh, my goodness.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.381
It's so beautiful.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.675
You really like it?

39:03.716 --> 39:05.844
[laughs] Yes! Why?

39:05.885 --> 39:07.679
Because it's mine.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.307
I signed
the papers today.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.349
Jack...

39:13.018 --> 39:14.519
What made you
decide to do it?

39:14.560 --> 39:15.770
Rip said
it was getting

39:15.812 --> 39:18.773
a little too crowded
at the jail, so...

39:18.815 --> 39:20.358
[laughs]

39:20.399 --> 39:22.401
Now I just got to
save up enough to--

39:22.443 --> 39:23.528
to build a place--

39:23.569 --> 39:24.654
a big kitchen,

39:24.696 --> 39:26.405
three, four bedrooms.

39:26.447 --> 39:29.075
That's an awfully big
house for one Mountie.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.244
Could get lonesome.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.537
Well...

39:32.578 --> 39:34.413
there's always Rip.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.415
Good old Rip.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.500
Maybe some chickens.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.502
Sure. You'll need
lots of chickens.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.503
A goat.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.629
Goats are good.

39:41.671 --> 39:42.964
Yeah.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.757
Anything else?

39:44.799 --> 39:46.384
Any ideas?

39:46.425 --> 39:47.426
A couple.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.386
Like?

39:48.427 --> 39:49.428
Well, you'll need a guest room

39:49.470 --> 39:50.805
for when your mother
comes to visit.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.432
Well, I can't forget about Ma.

39:53.474 --> 39:57.395
And a nice feather bed
for your blankie.

39:58.479 --> 39:59.772
My blankie?

39:59.814 --> 40:01.482
She didn't tell you
about--

40:01.524 --> 40:02.567
She did.

40:02.608 --> 40:05.111
She really needs
to stop sharing so much.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.113
I know all about your blankie,

40:07.155 --> 40:08.990
and how you wouldn't
go to sleep

40:09.032 --> 40:11.534
unless you had it with you
to keep you warm.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.078
Well...

40:13.119 --> 40:14.829
I guess I'm gonna
have to figure out

40:14.871 --> 40:16.414
another way
to keep warm at night.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.416
[♪♪♪]

40:20.501 --> 40:22.420
[thunder crashes]

40:25.548 --> 40:26.591
[laughs]

40:26.632 --> 40:28.509
[door opens]

40:28.551 --> 40:30.469
Bill?

40:30.511 --> 40:31.470
They're gone.

40:31.512 --> 40:32.055
Who?

40:32.097 --> 40:33.056
Henry and Nora.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.057
When I got home,

40:34.099 --> 40:35.433
I found this note
she left for me.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.061
"I'm sorry,

40:38.103 --> 40:40.479
but Henry said there's no time
for goodbyes."

40:40.521 --> 40:41.981
He must've left
by the South Road.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.942
It's the only one
that's safe after all the rain.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.110
What are you
going to do?

40:45.151 --> 40:46.236
Find him!

40:47.195 --> 40:49.155
[thunder crashing]

40:52.992 --> 40:54.160
[grunts]

40:54.202 --> 40:55.453
Last load
of the day.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.955
Yeah. Can't
come soon enough.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.207
[loud rumbling]

40:59.249 --> 41:00.250
You hear that?

41:00.292 --> 41:01.293
I think we should
get out of here.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.335
It's a landslide!

41:02.377 --> 41:03.253
Come on! Come on!

41:03.295 --> 41:04.379
Run!

41:04.421 --> 41:06.464
[rumbling continues]

41:08.841 --> 41:11.136
[♪♪♪]

41:14.055 --> 41:15.807
Maybe we should turn
around and head back.

41:15.848 --> 41:16.766
No. We don't stop

41:16.808 --> 41:18.435
till we make it
to Union City.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.518
Why?

41:19.560 --> 41:21.146
Just trust me, Nora.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.521
You know,
nobody appreciates

41:22.563 --> 41:24.399
what I've done,

41:24.441 --> 41:27.526
what I go through
every day.

41:27.568 --> 41:28.861
Henry, watch out!

41:28.987 --> 41:30.363
[crashing]

41:32.073 --> 41:36.286
[♪♪♪]
