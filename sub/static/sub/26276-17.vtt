over a million dollars
in cash, is gone.

Does HPD think there's
a connection between the two?

definitely possible.

No.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.647
there was something going
on I didn't know about.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.824
Maybe he was in some
kind of trouble.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.566
The point is, I thought
I knew my father, but...

05:49.610 --> 05:52.177
maybe I didn't
know him at all.

05:52.221 --> 05:55.050
That's why I'm
here, Mr. Magnum.

about the money.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.749

know the truth.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.883
Yeah.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.189
There's no indication

06:04.233 --> 06:06.322
that Roland McDowell was
anything but a stand-up guy.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.977
Can't be a coincidence
that the robbery took place

06:09.020 --> 06:10.805
right after he got done

06:10.848 --> 06:12.850
No, it's definitely suspicious,
I'll give you that,

06:12.894 --> 06:15.070
but so far we haven't
found evidence of a link,

06:15.113 --> 06:16.811
which means, for the time being,

06:16.854 --> 06:18.465
I need
to consider all scenarios,

06:18.508 --> 06:20.467
including the possibility

06:20.510 --> 06:22.599
that this was just
a random carjacking.And what?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.079
The carjackers got lucky?

06:24.122 --> 06:25.385
Right time, right place?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.822
Yeah. There's also
another possibility.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.389
What's that?

06:29.432 --> 06:32.435
Maybe your client
has the money.
What?

06:32.479 --> 06:33.871
Look, according to
Roland McDowell's will,

06:33.915 --> 06:35.177
the money was
never going to her.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.439
It was earmarked
for charity.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.702
Now, maybe after Karen
heard about her dad,

06:38.746 --> 06:40.269
she saw an opportunity.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.923
Got to the cash and hid it away

06:41.966 --> 06:43.577
before the estate
could get its hands on it.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.448
Serious?Look, when my tutu died,

06:45.492 --> 06:48.451
my cousin and his wife went
straight to her house

06:48.495 --> 06:49.887
and started taking things

06:49.931 --> 06:52.063
before the rest of the family
could get there.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.849
There are people who take
advantage of these situations.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.242
If Karen has the money,
why hire me to find it?

06:57.286 --> 06:59.636
Because it's a way
to take suspicion off of her.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.333
Look, you have to ask yourself,

07:01.377 --> 07:04.162
why would a loving father cut
his only child out of his will?

07:04.206 --> 07:06.077
Maybe she didn't
want the money.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.210
Ah, come on, Magnum, who
doesn't want a million bucks?

07:08.253 --> 07:09.298
So you're saying that hiring me

07:09.341 --> 07:10.604
was just some kind
of smokescreen?

07:10.647 --> 07:13.041
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.226
MAGNUM: As much as I wanted
to laugh it off,

07:24.269 --> 07:26.315
Katsumoto had gotten
in my head.

07:26.358 --> 07:29.623
So, just to be safe, I asked
Higgins to do some digging.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.756
See if Karen had
any secret bank accounts.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.237
HIGGINS: My contacts turned up
no red flags.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.282
No offshore accounts
in Karen's name.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.588
No numbered accounts.

07:38.632 --> 07:41.069
And nothing set up
under any dummy corporations.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.505
But that doesn't exclude
the possibility

07:42.549 --> 07:44.333
that she's hiding money
some other way.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.075
She's 25. I mean,
she's barely out of university.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.772
She's not exactly
a criminal mastermind.

07:48.816 --> 07:49.947
Yeah, but it wouldn't
be the first time

07:49.991 --> 07:51.079
a client tried to play me.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.559
I suppose that's true.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.125
Even so, Ms. McDowell's

07:54.169 --> 07:56.388
primary reason for hiring you
wasn't to find the money.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.999
It was to learn why

07:58.042 --> 08:00.001
her father would make
such a large withdrawal.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.306
Yeah, but that's the question

08:01.350 --> 08:03.352
nobody has an answer to,
including the bank.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.310
You spoke to them?Yeah, Rick knows
the branch manager.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.660
According to her,

08:06.703 --> 08:09.184
Roland didn't say why he
was taking the money out.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.968
This is actually him.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.317
This photo is
from the surveillance video

08:12.361 --> 08:14.015
taken on the day
of the withdrawal.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.626
What could all of that cash
have been for?

08:16.670 --> 08:19.194
Debt? Gambling addiction?

08:19.237 --> 08:20.935
Crazy drug habit?

08:20.978 --> 08:23.198
I don't know,
but if we're gonna find out,

08:23.241 --> 08:25.113
we have to start digging
into Roland's life.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.332
That begins
with searching his home.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.338
MAGNUM:
How's it going over there?

08:33.382 --> 08:35.340
Nothing unusual
in Roland's search history.

08:35.384 --> 08:38.822
No gambling sites, no signs
of any out-of-control spending.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.520
And the only drug he appeared
to be interested in

08:40.563 --> 08:42.391
was something called
Phallux.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.915
Oh, it's for
erectile dysfunction.

08:44.959 --> 08:48.179
And, no, I don't take it.

08:48.223 --> 08:49.833
Hmm.
Love the
commercials, though.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.443
Well, I suppose his interest

08:51.487 --> 08:53.358
in that kind
of medication makes sense.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.664
Why is that?

08:54.708 --> 08:56.405
Because, before
he was murdered,

08:56.448 --> 08:58.668
he was logging
onto an online dating website

08:58.712 --> 09:00.583
called Ok Venus
almost every day.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.194
According to his profile,
he was athletic, adventurous,

09:03.238 --> 09:05.240
and had a penchant
for opera and theater.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.589
And apparently blondes.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.330
This guy definitely
had a type.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.506
Mm-hmm.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.248
Interesting. It would appear
his late wife was also a blonde.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.338
Hold on.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.992
What?

09:18.035 --> 09:20.472
Didn't seem strange
at first, but look.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.387
It's a blonde woman. So?

09:22.431 --> 09:23.954
Yeah, but she's not
in the teller line,

09:23.998 --> 09:26.261
and it doesn't look like
she works at the bank.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.219
You're thinking that one
of these women was with Roland

09:28.263 --> 09:29.960
when he made the withdrawal?

09:30.004 --> 09:31.962
[door opens]

09:32.006 --> 09:34.008
No one's supposed
to be here.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.404
[door closes]

09:44.366 --> 09:45.454
[gasps]
Oh, God!

09:46.586 --> 09:48.065
Mr. Magnum.
Karen.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.328
What are you doing he...?
Who is she?

09:50.372 --> 09:52.548
[laughs]
Uh, this is Higgins.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.506
She's helping
with the case.
Hello. Sorry.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.813
I don't understand.
You, you broke in?

09:56.857 --> 09:59.076
Y-Yeah. Sorry.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.557
Why didn't you just ask me
to let you in?

10:04.778 --> 10:07.041
I can't believe
you would take them seriously.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.652
Well, I know how this
must make you feel,

10:09.696 --> 10:11.567
but the police have to consider
all possible scenarios,

10:11.611 --> 10:12.786
and I had to at least

10:12.829 --> 10:14.657
entertain the
possibility.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.921
I already told you,
I don't care about the money.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.315
My dad already gave me so much
growing up.

10:21.577 --> 10:24.449
When I was young,
we lost my mom.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.452
And after that, my dad had
to make all kinds of sacrifices

10:27.496 --> 10:28.976
so he could be there for me.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.673
If he wanted

10:30.717 --> 10:33.763
that money to go to charity, I
would want to honor his wishes.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.159
Sounds like your father
was a very special man.

10:42.163 --> 10:45.601
Now that you're here,
though, you could help us.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.255
How so?

10:47.298 --> 10:50.519
Well, for starters, was
your father seeing anyone?

10:50.562 --> 10:52.956
You mean, like dating? No.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.393
No, he wasn't interested
in meeting anybody.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.658
Actually,
that's not entirely true.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.445
These are six women

11:03.488 --> 11:05.752
that he had recently
gone out with.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.625
I had no idea.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.453
I was always worried

11:11.496 --> 11:13.455
he was lonely,
but he said he was okay.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.761
Do you recognize anyone?

11:14.804 --> 11:17.241
[sighs]

11:17.285 --> 11:18.765
What about this woman?

11:18.808 --> 11:21.376
Blonde here on the right.No.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.770
Do you think she has something
to do with the missing money?

11:23.813 --> 11:25.249
Well, we're not sure yet.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.251
But we're gonna find out.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.868
Well, did the bank surveillance
video give us anything?

11:34.911 --> 11:36.565
See for yourself.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.481
Look at his eyes.
They're on the blonde,

11:39.524 --> 11:41.613
and then she follows him out.You were right.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.572
She was with him.Yeah.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.879
Find her, we find answers.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.924
Maybe even the cash.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.413
Okay, occupation.

11:58.456 --> 12:03.244
How about we go with
genius inventor/industrialist.

12:03.287 --> 12:06.247
Wait, hold on.
That's Tony Stark.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.814
[chuckles]:
Yeah.
All right,
okay, you're right.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.685
Uh, let's have something
a little more realistic.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.558
How about...
European sports car importer?

12:13.602 --> 12:14.821
That works.
Yeah.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.040
MAGNUM:
Guys, remember, this
profile we build

12:17.084 --> 12:19.347
has to match me up with the same
women that Roland dated.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.349
And hope that they agree
to go out with you.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.742
[chuckles]Uh-oh.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.353
Three grown men huddled
around a laptop.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.746
That can't be good.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.922
Hey, Higgy, what's your
favorite Spanish opera?

12:28.965 --> 12:31.533
Lope de Vega's
La selva sin amor.

12:31.576 --> 12:32.795
Why? What are you doing?

12:32.839 --> 12:34.362
How do you spell that?

12:34.405 --> 12:37.104
Uh, we're helping to set up
Thomas's online dating profile.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.496
You're actually
going to go through

12:38.540 --> 12:40.107
with that cockamamy idea?

12:40.150 --> 12:42.674
What? I have to meet each one
of these women face-to-face,

12:42.718 --> 12:44.546
and a simple background check
isn't gonna do it.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.852
You know what I think?Hmm?

12:45.895 --> 12:47.549
I think he's finally
found an opportunity

12:47.592 --> 12:50.291
to spend his client's money
whilst meeting women.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.684
Oh, come on. That's...
that's not true.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.121
Look, if I was a cop,

12:54.164 --> 12:55.775
I'd meet every one
of these women face-to-face

12:55.818 --> 12:59.082
and interview them, but I'm not,
so this is the next best thing.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.518
Yeah, he's right.
Look, first dates

13:00.562 --> 13:02.564
are all about asking
questions.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.609
So this way
Thomas can take them out,

13:04.653 --> 13:07.787
do a subtle interrogation,
and with any luck,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.571
he'll have ID'd the black
widow before the check comes.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.660
Black widow?Yeah, you know, a woman

13:11.703 --> 13:14.054
that bilks a man out of all
his money and then kills him.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.838
Thank you, Rick,
I'm familiar with the term.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.666
So, now you're thinking

13:17.709 --> 13:19.755
our mystery woman has something
to do with Roland's murder?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.975
Well, it's a working theory.
I mean, think about it.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.716
This woman gets this old guy
to pull out a big pile of cash

13:24.760 --> 13:27.241
and then uses the carjacking
as a cover to rob him.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.982
TC:
Okay.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.070
Done.

13:30.113 --> 13:34.378
Thomas, you are now
Tomás Caballé.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.684
Nice move.TC:
Opera lover

13:35.727 --> 13:38.774
and European sports
car importer.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.428
Now, that's
boyfriend material.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.212
"Speaks five languages"?

13:42.256 --> 13:43.692
Mm-hmm.[chuckles]:
Come on.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.650
I mean, he can barely
handle English.[scoffs]

13:45.694 --> 13:47.957
"Hobbies include
powerlifting"?

13:48.001 --> 13:49.176
RICK:
Yeah, we were thinking

13:49.219 --> 13:51.526
about inserting
some pictures of his calves.

13:51.569 --> 13:52.527
We got to do that.'Cause they're fantastic.

13:52.570 --> 13:53.658
Yeah. Thanks, man.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.051
Yeah, they are
your best asset.Guns.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.705
Get that shot.It is no wonder

13:56.748 --> 13:58.489
that you guys are
all still single.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.709
I mean, you want to know
what a woman wants?

14:00.752 --> 14:02.711
Why don't you ask one?
Give it here.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.887
Give it.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.933
TC:
Party pooper.Okay.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.630
Well, uh, in the meantime,

14:08.673 --> 14:10.588
why don't you guys
go hit up Kawika.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.720
See if he can track down
Roland's missing car.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.504
All right, sure thing.All right.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.680
Bye, Higgy.Bye.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.247
Magnum, you know,

14:17.291 --> 14:19.467
women really don't care
what your calves look like,

14:19.510 --> 14:21.164
particularly the woman
that you're after.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.557
Assuming that she is
a black widow,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.385
she's gonna be looking
for an easy mark,

14:24.428 --> 14:25.690
someone she can fleece.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.779
That means someone
who is insecure

14:27.823 --> 14:29.607
and easy to manipulate.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.175
Roland was a lonely widower.
That made him a prime target.

14:32.219 --> 14:35.004
We need to make sure
you look equally desirable.

14:35.048 --> 14:38.660
So now I'm a lonely doctor
who lives on a massive estate

14:38.703 --> 14:41.576
with a world-renowned
wine collection.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.752
That you will never
lay your hands on.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.844
Okay, there's just
one more thing we need to do.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.715
I took the liberty
of photoshopping

14:50.759 --> 14:52.108
some of your
personal photographs,

14:52.152 --> 14:53.501
because if this is gonna work,

14:53.544 --> 14:55.155
you're gonna need
to look pretentious.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.852
MAGNUM:
Come on, seriously?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.245
I hate that guy.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.901
You may,
but a black widow wouldn't.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.641
Okay, I've also hacked
the website to ensure

15:03.685 --> 15:05.774
that you're matched with the
same women that Roland dated.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.036
Although, of course,
I can't guarantee

15:07.080 --> 15:08.603
that they're going
to swipe on you.

15:08.646 --> 15:09.865
Oh, come on, they'll swipe.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.736
That's rather presumptuous.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.652
I'm just trying to think
positive, that's all.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.351
Trying to think.
Something you're rather good at.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.440
Anyway, I'm going
to leave you to it.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.702
Best of luck.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.326
Don't mind me.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.588
I don't.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.897
Uh, you might want to work up
to that one, Magnum.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.725
It has a few rather
big words in it.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.292
I'll grab a dictionary.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.642
Why are you borrowing
a book on human anatomy?

15:47.685 --> 15:49.557
I have a date.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.819
Put down the book.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.039
I'll explain
the birds and the bees.No.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.823
No, no, thanks. Higgins built

15:54.866 --> 15:56.564
this online dating
profile for me

15:56.607 --> 15:58.696
and said I was a retired
vascular surgeon.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.394
So I got to bone up.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.613
You cannot possibly hope
to absorb the information

16:02.657 --> 16:04.093
required to pass yourself off
as a doctor,

16:04.137 --> 16:06.008
let alone a surgeon
with a complex specialty,

16:06.052 --> 16:07.488
in one single night.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.185
What choice do I have?
And, frankly,

16:09.229 --> 16:12.014
I don't think you know how
to properly build a cover.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.842
Every great lie

16:13.885 --> 16:15.017
has a little bit of truth in it.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.801
And what might you
have preferred?

16:16.845 --> 16:20.109
I don't know, baseball player,
bull rider, race car driver.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.676
I actually considered
all three as a kid.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.808
[laughs]: I'm sorry,
did you just say bull rider?

16:23.852 --> 16:25.897
Un jinete de toros.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.684
I wanted to be a bull rider
when I was nine years old.

16:29.727 --> 16:30.859
Bull.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.034
No, I swear. When I was a kid,

16:32.078 --> 16:33.731
I used to go
to my uncle's house in Mexico,

16:33.775 --> 16:35.472
and he'd take us to the rodeo.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.866
I loved it. You know,
I could talk bull riding

16:37.909 --> 16:38.867
till the cows come home,

16:38.910 --> 16:41.130
but vascular surgery,
not so much.

16:41.174 --> 16:45.613
So, if you'll excuse me, I have
a lot of studying ahead of me.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.617
Dictionary.Right.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.229
[humming]

16:53.273 --> 16:54.883
KUMU:
Enjoy your homework, Doctor.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.668
Will do, Kumu.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.026
[phone chiming]

17:20.387 --> 17:22.084
MAGNUM:
Higgins. Higgins, wait up.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.782
Hey, check it out.
It worked. I matched up

17:24.826 --> 17:27.089
with, uh, two of the six women
that Roland dated,

17:27.133 --> 17:30.049
and-and two more swiped on me
in the middle of the night.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.051
Congratulations. Your
very clever little method

17:32.094 --> 17:33.748
of spending your client's money

17:33.791 --> 17:36.359
whilst also meeting new women
to shag was a smashing success.

17:36.403 --> 17:37.882
Who said anything
about shagging?

17:37.926 --> 17:39.319
Just gonna suss 'em out.
You know, if they don't seem

17:39.362 --> 17:41.103
like the kind of women
that would kill a man

17:41.147 --> 17:43.279
and steal a million dollars,
then I'll never see 'em again.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.454
Unless they're attractive.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.282
I don't need
some dating app to meet women.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.154
I do just fine.
Speaking of which,

17:48.197 --> 17:51.070
I got to shower.
I'm meeting Kesha for lunch.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.420
Ah, Kesha. The one with
the lower back tattoo.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.422
Why are you being
such a hater?

17:55.465 --> 17:58.077
Are you a little jealous I'm
going out on all these dates?

17:58.120 --> 17:59.687
Don't be ridiculous.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.951
I don't know. I think maybe
you should download this app.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.214
It's not like you're meeting
a bunch of guys out here

18:05.258 --> 18:06.781
managing this estate.

18:06.824 --> 18:10.480
Online dating? I would literally
rather get hit in the face

18:10.524 --> 18:11.525
with a golf shoe.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.874
Besides, when it
comes to romance,

18:12.917 --> 18:15.572
I'm a tad more
discerning than you are.Meaning?

18:15.616 --> 18:18.488
Meaning I'm not gonna go out
with just anyone

18:18.532 --> 18:20.969
merely because they glance
in my general direction.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.275
Contrary to what
you might think,

18:22.318 --> 18:23.667
I actually don't date very much.

18:23.711 --> 18:24.886
You, on the other hand,

18:24.929 --> 18:26.670
haven't gone out
on a single date

18:26.714 --> 18:28.194
since I met you. Why is that?

18:28.237 --> 18:29.543
I'm a busy woman.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.675
[chuckles]:
Busy? It's 11:00 a.m.,

18:31.719 --> 18:33.590
and you're doing yoga.

18:33.634 --> 18:37.116
This is my time for myself.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.682
Can I tell you something?

18:38.726 --> 18:41.120
If you must.

18:43.165 --> 18:46.429
I was with somebody
that I thought was the one,

18:46.473 --> 18:49.389
and she hurt me in ways that
I didn't think were possible.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.480
And you would think maybe,
after something like that,

18:53.523 --> 18:55.786
I wouldn't be willing
to open myself up again,

18:55.830 --> 18:59.703
but I'm willing
to give love another shot.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.575
Your point is...?

19:01.618 --> 19:02.924
My point is,

19:02.967 --> 19:05.883
I'm sure you're afraid
of getting hurt again

19:05.927 --> 19:07.146
after what you've been through,

19:07.189 --> 19:08.669
but closing yourself off

19:08.712 --> 19:11.280
and denying yourself
a chance at love

19:11.324 --> 19:13.543
is not the way
to go through life.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.198
I mean, at some point,
you got to get back out there.

19:18.374 --> 19:23.901
Speaking of which, uh, Dr. Tomás
Caballé has a date to go to.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.555
Enjoy your yoga.

MAGNUM:
Blind dates
with six beautiful women?

19:42.659 --> 19:45.227
I'm not gonna lie,
it's tempting.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.490
But in this job,
your reputation is everything,

19:47.534 --> 19:49.318
and that means
being a professional.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.799
Especially if it means
proving Higgins wrong.

19:51.842 --> 19:54.845
The subtle art
of questioning a suspect:

19:54.889 --> 19:56.804
observe, watch for cues,

19:56.847 --> 19:59.328
who's lying, who's sincere.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.243
[breathing heavily]

20:01.287 --> 20:02.853
Come on, slowpoke.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.812
Slowpoke? Please.

20:04.855 --> 20:07.597
I thought you said
this was gonna be a workout.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.338
It was my first time
using the site.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.557
How about you?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.385
I'm on, like, five
different apps right now.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.951
How does it compare?

20:13.995 --> 20:16.824
They were nice men, just
not what I was looking for.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.565
I didn't even know about the app

20:18.608 --> 20:20.349
until a friend of mine
from the gym told me about it.

20:20.393 --> 20:21.611
Roland McDowell.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.439
I figured what the
hell, you know?

20:23.483 --> 20:24.745
Wait, Roland?

20:24.788 --> 20:26.529
I think I matched with him.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.749
He's an older guy, right?Yeah, yeah.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.926
He seemed sweet, I just couldn't
get past the age difference.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.756
I was gonna thank him, but I
found out he had been killed.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.105
Oh, God.
Yeah.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.585
Carjacking, if you
can believe it.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.021
How awful.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.675
Yeah, it is.

20:41.718 --> 20:45.026
Wait, do you mean
Roland McDowell?

20:45.069 --> 20:46.984
You knew Roland?
Yeah.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.377
We went out.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.423
We even talked about
seeing each other again.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.642
I couldn't believe
it when I heard.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.296
His poor daughter.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.906
You know?
They were so close.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.604
Yeah, it's really sad.Oh, so sad.

20:57.647 --> 20:58.822
[phone ringing]

20:58.866 --> 21:01.216
Ah, I'm sorry, Cleo.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.000
Um, it's a colleague.
I have to take this.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.567
Yeah, it's okay.
Excuse me.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.830
[clears throat]
Yes, Dr. Wright.

21:06.874 --> 21:07.831
RICK:
Oh, hey, Doctor.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.355
Just talked to Kawika.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.661
He thinks that Roland's car
was tossed in a container

21:11.705 --> 21:13.184
and shipped overseas.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.577
Lucky for us, he
knows somebody

21:14.621 --> 21:15.970
who works down at the port.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.841
Traffics in stolen
cars on the side.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.582
We're gonna go talk to him.

21:19.626 --> 21:21.105
Okay. Let me know
what they say.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.020
What about you,
Dr. Caballé?

21:23.064 --> 21:24.587
How's it going, bro?

21:24.631 --> 21:25.806
Any suspects?

21:25.849 --> 21:27.895
Unfortunately, no one
stands out just yet.

21:27.938 --> 21:30.724
But I still have one
more date to go on.

21:30.767 --> 21:34.205
Curating a good wine collection
is actually a lot of work.

21:34.249 --> 21:37.121
You'd be surprised
how quickly wine can spoil.

21:37.165 --> 21:41.604
But... enough about
Merlot and opera.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.127
Tell me about you, Abigail.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.607
Oh. Abby.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.435
Abby.
[laughs]:
Abby.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.698
Uh, I'm a lawyer
at a small firm.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.701
We do mostly criminal
defense work, some civil.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.137
Mm. Interesting.Mm.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.922
What do you do
on your off time?

21:54.965 --> 21:58.708
Unfortunately, I don't have that
much of it, but when I do, I...

21:58.752 --> 22:01.058
I don't know, I try
to stay physical, I surf-ski.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.670
I also do some volunteer work
with local veterans,

22:03.713 --> 22:05.324
giving them free legal aid.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.803
I come from
a military family,

22:06.847 --> 22:09.632
so that kind of thing
is really important to me.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.286
How about you?
Do you, um...

22:11.330 --> 22:12.809
do any volunteer work?

22:12.853 --> 22:15.812
I imagine being a doctor,
you have lots of opportunities.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.730
No. I left medicine behind
when I moved out here.

22:20.774 --> 22:21.949
Really?Yeah.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.385
Huh.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.387
But you have such a gift.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.520
You'd be helping
so many people.

22:27.563 --> 22:30.305
True. But I've helped so many
people back on the mainland.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.655
And plus, I've... I've
saved so many lives, I...

22:32.699 --> 22:34.875
honestly, I
can't remember.

22:37.660 --> 22:38.618
Ah.

22:39.923 --> 22:42.491
You know, I noticed in
your profile picture,

22:42.535 --> 22:44.058
you had blonde hair.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.712
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.061
That was a phase.

22:47.104 --> 22:49.890
Also, it was
a little shorter.Mm-hmm.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.718
I prefer my natural color.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.763
[phone chimes]Oh, goodness. Excuse me.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.724
Wow. I am so sorry.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.900
Um... I got to run.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.120
What's the rush?Look...

23:03.164 --> 23:05.209
you seem like a good guy,
Tomás, I...

23:05.253 --> 23:06.863
You're just not my type.

23:06.907 --> 23:09.692
Wha-What-what
are you looking for?

23:11.694 --> 23:13.653
Somebody grounded.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.655
Simple. Somebody who...

23:15.698 --> 23:18.440
helps others
and doesn't do it for the money.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.574
You know, a guy who'd rather
have a beer than fancy wine,

23:21.617 --> 23:24.838
and would rather go
to a ball game than the opera.

23:24.881 --> 23:29.799
Somebody who appreciates the
fine art of sleeping in and...

23:29.843 --> 23:33.194
wouldn't get annoyed
if I wanted to eat in bed.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.283
[chuckles]

23:35.326 --> 23:37.111
It's nice meeting you.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.593
MAGNUM:
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking:

23:40.636 --> 23:43.291
that woman seems
absolutely perfect for me.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.467
And you might be right.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.817
But that's not
why I'm following her.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.080
See, the thing
about black widows

23:50.124 --> 23:52.474
is that they're great
at seducing their marks,

23:52.518 --> 23:54.345
playing hard to get.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.999
So it's possible
Abby's putdowns

23:56.043 --> 23:57.174
were a calculated move

23:57.218 --> 23:58.349
meant to undermine
my confidence

23:58.393 --> 24:02.310
and make me crave her approval.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.499
[sighs]
Terrific.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.545
No phone.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.738
In the police report a witness
described the carjacker

24:38.781 --> 24:41.392
as a Caucasian male,
six feet tall,

24:41.436 --> 24:44.526
over 200 pounds
with black hair.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.399
In other words, this guy.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.882
Looks like Abby might not be
the perfect woman after all.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.501
KATSUMOTO:
Okay, so he matches
the description

25:02.544 --> 25:03.893
of the carjacker.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.721
But so do thousands of
other men on this island.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.767
Yeah, but he's the only one
hanging out with the woman

25:07.810 --> 25:09.203
who may be the blonde
from the bank.

25:09.246 --> 25:12.336
Well, minor problem.
This one has brown hair.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.816
Yes, obviously,
she dyed her hair blonde,

25:13.860 --> 25:16.340
which is a little suspect
in itself, don't you think?

25:16.384 --> 25:17.603
Here she is,
paying the guy off.

25:17.646 --> 25:20.344
A guy I followed home
to a halfway house,

25:20.388 --> 25:21.998
which means he's probably
on parole.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.087
I-I'm telling you, there's got
to be some kind of connection

25:24.131 --> 25:26.133
between Roland McDowell's murder
and the missing money.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.048
[phone ringing]

25:28.091 --> 25:29.615
Uh, there's someone
at the gate,

25:29.658 --> 25:31.704
and I don't think
it's for me.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.447
That's Cleo.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.971
Wonder what she wants.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.015
[clears throat]

25:42.410 --> 25:43.803
Hey, you.

25:43.846 --> 25:47.720
Hey. You left this on the table
when you rushed off.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.939
Oh, my-my cell phone.
I-I thought I lost it.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.680
Thanks for, uh, bringing it by.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.726
Oh, yeah, it's no trouble.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.510
This is on my way to power yoga.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.731
Power yoga?
Wow, that sounds fun.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.341
You should join me sometime,

26:00.384 --> 26:02.125
if you don't mind
getting sweaty.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.953
[chuckles]
I don't mind getting sweaty.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.868
Or maybe we could
just grab dinner.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.870
Yeah, yeah, that
would be great.

26:07.914 --> 26:10.351
I will have my assistant
set that up.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.614
Okay, great.
Let me know.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.747
Um, can I just drop this
in the mailbox, then?

26:14.790 --> 26:16.487
I'm late for my class.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.141
It's perfect.
Thank you.

26:18.185 --> 26:21.580
Okay, well, I guess I will be
talking to you soon.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.190
[chuckles]
Toodles.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.192
[chuckles]
Okay. Bye.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.150
I really feel for that woman.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.980
You know, I'll give her a call,
let her down easy.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.766
No, I was referring to her
incredibly poor taste in men.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.638
I'll run this guy's photo
through the system.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.728
If he's an ex-con, shouldn't
be hard to get an ID.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.034
Toodles.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.516
MAGNUM: Hey, Karen, it's Thomas Magnum.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.518
I may have a lead.

26:47.562 --> 26:50.086
I'd like to show you
some photos, if possible.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.174
Yeah, of course.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.264
You recognize either of 'em?

26:54.308 --> 26:55.657
No. Who are they?

26:55.701 --> 26:57.398
Well, the woman,
your father dated.

26:57.441 --> 27:00.270
The guy,
we're not sure about.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.838
Hey-hey, I got to go,
but I'll keep you posted, okay?

27:02.882 --> 27:03.970
Okay. Thanks.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.276
What's up?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.931
It's bachelorette
number two,

27:08.975 --> 27:11.412
aka your prime suspect.

27:12.805 --> 27:13.806
Hmm.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.902
Your guest, sir.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.381
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

27:24.425 --> 27:26.427
No. That'll be just fine.

27:26.470 --> 27:27.994
Thank you.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.560
I always hire English help.

27:29.604 --> 27:30.997
So much nicer than Americans,
you know?

27:31.040 --> 27:32.825
Cut the crap.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.087
Who the hell are you?

27:34.130 --> 27:37.003
Dr. Tomás Caballé.Please, just stop lying.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.918
[chuckles]
I don't follow. I...

27:38.961 --> 27:40.267
Well, follow this.
I suddenly have

27:40.310 --> 27:42.008
a Detective Katsumoto
from the HPD

27:42.051 --> 27:44.663

40:14.673 --> 40:16.631
Hmm.My favorite beer
is probably

40:16.675 --> 40:20.766
a Coops, followed closely
by an Old Dusseldorf.

40:20.809 --> 40:24.422
I mean, that is,
that's me in a nutshell.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.817
So let me
try this again.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.820
Would you please go
on a date with me?

40:42.788 --> 40:44.354
[door closes]

40:44.398 --> 40:45.921
[exhales]
Hey.

40:45.965 --> 40:49.098
Wanted to thank you for the
whole flower suggestion.

40:49.142 --> 40:50.709
Uh, it took a
little convincing,

40:50.752 --> 40:53.102
but Abby is going on
another date with me.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.757
Huh. She seems
like a good one, Magnum.

40:55.801 --> 40:57.150
Try not to blow it.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.369
I'll do my best.
What's with the dress?

40:59.413 --> 41:01.459
I am going on a date.

41:01.502 --> 41:02.851
Really?

41:02.895 --> 41:03.852
Taking your advice.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.071
Who's the guy?

41:05.114 --> 41:06.507
He's a friend
of Robin's

41:06.551 --> 41:07.813
who's in town. Baseball chap.

41:07.856 --> 41:09.249
Baseball chap.

41:09.292 --> 41:12.339
You're not talking about
Christian Yelich, are you?

41:12.382 --> 41:14.646
That's him. He's not bad
from what I've seen.

41:14.689 --> 41:17.736
Not bad? The guy's, like,
a National League MVP.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.955
And I surmise from your tone
that that's a good thing?

41:19.999 --> 41:22.218
He batted, like, a .326.
36 homers,

41:22.262 --> 41:23.524
110 RBIs.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.439
I mean, the guy's,
like, a baseball god.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.006
[laughs]:
How did this even happen?

41:27.049 --> 41:28.834
He asked me out.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.836
And not via some silly app.

41:30.879 --> 41:32.968
He did it
the old-fashioned way,

41:33.012 --> 41:34.840
like a gentleman.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.842
Anyway,

41:36.885 --> 41:38.278
must go, don't wait up.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.889
Do you mind if I just join you
for a little bit?

41:40.933 --> 41:42.369
Absolutely not.I will be gone

41:42.412 --> 41:44.284
by the time you guys
are done with appetizers.

41:44.327 --> 41:46.329
Good night, Magnum.
