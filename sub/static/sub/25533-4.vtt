00:45.503 --> 00:47.505
I see it. I go now.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.967
Well, that combined
everything that I love.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.470
A long schlep to the top of a thing,

00:54.471 --> 00:59.142
to a terrifying height, with just a thin
little guardrail between me and death.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.644
And not even any food at the top,
by the way.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.313
Stupid Richard.

[Phil] The first recollection
I have of Copenhagen

01:54.906 --> 01:59.160
was the Hans Christian Andersen
musical movie starring Danny Kaye.

01:59.702 --> 02:03.081
Hans Christian Andersen wrote
some of your favorite little stories

02:03.164 --> 02:07.585
like "The Ugly Duckling"
and "Thumbelina" and "The Little Mermaid."

02:08.461 --> 02:09.838
The songs are amazing.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.007
And the thing that became
the theme song in my mind

02:13.091 --> 02:16.177
for this place:
"Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen."

02:16.719 --> 02:20.473
And then you get here,
and I have to say it kind of is.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.727
It's beautiful.
It's like an idealized society

02:24.811 --> 02:28.481
where you walk and you bike
and it's clean.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.067
The tax bracket is like 50 percent,

02:31.151 --> 02:35.530
but you get free education,
free health care, free-- Free everything.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.700
Clean air, clean water, and the food!

02:39.409 --> 02:42.996
The Nordic cuisine celebrates
the forest and the sea and the field.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.416
They're celebrating what's around them.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.836
Take all that
and put it on a slice of amazing bread

02:49.919 --> 02:52.755
and you have
the most traditional Danish food there is.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.591
Just don't ask me to pronounce it.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.885
I'm going to Aamanns Deli.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.014
Chef Adam Aamann makes these things
better than anybody else.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.308
And Copenhagen food writer Marie Olesen

03:03.391 --> 03:05.727
will keep me from looking
like too much of an idiot.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.812
I'm ready for a smørrebrød.

03:08.187 --> 03:09.772
-Smørrebrød.
-Did I say it right?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.983
-Yeah, almost. Smørrebrød.
-Smirbroad.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.110
Is that right? Smirgabroad.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.615
Smirgabroad? Smirgbroad.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.075
The world's hardest language.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.661
A piece of bread and you--
Something you smear on it.

03:23.745 --> 03:28.166
And then you layer it and you layer it.
And you put little beautiful things on top

03:28.249 --> 03:29.792
-and it's delicious.
-[Phil] I love it.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.045
-Open face sandwich.
-[Marie] Open face sandwiches, yeah.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.546
[Phil] These are like gourmet smears.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.257
Not like some peanut butter and jelly
that I would do at home.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.926
This is a piece of art for sure.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.970
-There you are. Hi.
-You're Adam. The owner and chef.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.098
[Adam] Have you tried smørrebrød before?

03:44.182 --> 03:47.977
[Phil] I have tasted it,
but I'm hearing that this is the place.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.688
It's like the rye bread
is the canvas for the art, right?

03:50.772 --> 03:52.357
-[Marie] Exactly.
-Then you do what you want.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.609
[Adam] This is
like a Scandinavian tradition.

03:54.692 --> 03:55.985
[Phil] I'm hungry, I'm ready.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.904
And thirsty I hope. Yeah?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.072
-Yeah.
-For some snaps?

03:59.155 --> 04:00.531
-I'll do anything you say.
-[Adam] Great.

04:00.615 --> 04:04.369
I mean, it's Monday so... hard liquor.
That's the way to start the week, I think.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.497
-In the middle of the day?
-That's what all Danes do for lunch

04:07.580 --> 04:09.165
when they come to eat smørrebrød.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.627
Snaps traditionally goes with smørrebrød.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.337
That's what they do here.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.257
It's not me. I'm not demanding alcohol.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.883
I prepared some snaps.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.510
-[Marie] Sounds excellent.
-Here we go.

04:20.593 --> 04:24.180
And a little bit of beer, you know,
to make the hard liquor flow more easily.

04:24.931 --> 04:25.974
Goodbye, everybody.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.852
[Phil] So, we're going on a picnic
in Østre Anlæg park

04:30.270 --> 04:31.896
with these nice people I just met.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.067
Now if someone hasn't had any before,

04:36.818 --> 04:39.153
what would be the first one
you wanted them to try?

04:39.654 --> 04:40.488
-Herring.
-Really?

04:40.571 --> 04:42.782
Herring is the natural place to start.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.159
-Number one?
-Number one. Marinated herring.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.245
[Phil] Wow, that's gorgeous. Look at that.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.663
-And Phil?
-Yes.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.457
I know you're an American
and you like to eat with your hands,

04:52.000 --> 04:53.876
but you need to let it rest on the plate

04:54.502 --> 04:56.796
-and use your knife and fork.
-Sorry, everybody.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.299
-Sorry. I'm the American embarrassment.
-[Adam chuckles]

04:59.382 --> 05:00.633
As if we don't have enough.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.844
[Adam and Marie chuckle]

05:02.927 --> 05:05.930
[Adam] This is matured herring
in vinegar brine,

05:06.014 --> 05:08.683
with marinated new Danish potatoes,

05:08.766 --> 05:12.729
homemade sour cream
and then fried buckwheat on top.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.188
Mm.

05:14.272 --> 05:18.026
So, important thing when you eat herring
in Denmark is the snaps.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.487
This is our own invention
made of rye bread actually.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.156
Skål, my friends.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.282
-[Marie] Skål.
-[Adam] Skål.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.119
Have you been told why we say "skål"
in Denmark, by the way?

05:28.202 --> 05:30.163
-Why you say skål? Tell me.
-[Marie] Yeah, what it means.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.373
Skål apparently means--
It's-- It means skull.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.291
[Phil] Oh.

05:33.374 --> 05:37.879
So, the white Vikings would cheer
in an actual skull after a victory.

05:38.629 --> 05:39.922
We need a skull. Anybody?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.091
-A bowl. So like a bowl on your head.
-Somebody's head.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.635
Like the ac--
The actual skull of their enemy.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.345
-They would use after victory.
-Oh, the skull.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.513
-Richard.
-[Marie] To cheer.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.433
-[Adam] We need your skull.
-[Marie] It's very, uh...

05:50.516 --> 05:52.018
Could you lie down for a moment?

05:52.101 --> 05:53.352
[laughs]

05:55.605 --> 05:56.731
[Phil] Hello, pretty.

05:56.814 --> 06:01.110
[Adam] This is braised pork with rhubarbs,
some crumble of dry salted bacon.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.696
And this is the picnic way
of opening a beer, right?

06:04.072 --> 06:05.573
[Phil] Yeah, that sounds good!

06:05.656 --> 06:06.991
Goodbye, water.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.367
[Adam chuckles]

06:08.785 --> 06:11.871
[Phil] Smørrebrød is something from,
I'm guessing, your childhood

06:11.954 --> 06:16.167
that you always loved and said, "Someday
I'm going to open a place that does this."

06:16.667 --> 06:21.172
When I opened the shop, the smørrebrød
was at a really low, kind of low peak,

06:22.006 --> 06:24.634
even though it's like the major--

06:24.842 --> 06:26.094
Sorry, I'm not listening.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.887
[Adam chuckles] Great.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.515
Pork wins!

06:32.350 --> 06:33.351
I did hear you.

06:33.559 --> 06:37.021
[Adam] Even though it's the major
Danish contribution to world gastronomy,

06:37.105 --> 06:41.025
nobody really wanted to touch it at that--
Ten years ago.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.277
Because it was considered old-fashioned.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.447
In the old days, you would
make a really large piece of smørrebrød.

06:46.531 --> 06:50.660
It would be like a small piece of bread
with a tsunami of meat on top.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.412
That's gonna be my life story.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.038
A tsunami of meat.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.748
-Very far from fine dining.
-[Phil] Yes.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.836
For the past ten years, things have been
developing, so this is what it's come to.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.506
I'm very glad I've come here
at the right moment in time.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.799
[Marie and Adam chuckle]

07:04.882 --> 07:07.593
[Phil laughs]

07:07.677 --> 07:08.761
Give me that sandwich!

07:13.057 --> 07:16.060
So, I think if you're into food
and you're coming to København,

07:16.727 --> 07:18.104
you've heard of Noma.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.983
It won best restaurant in the world
over and over again

07:22.525 --> 07:26.112
thanks to the vision
of new Nordic pioneer René Redzepi.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.657
So, when we get here, Noma is closed.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.953
It's set to reopen in another space
in 2018, but in the meantime,

07:34.036 --> 07:36.914
the old Noma space has found
a perfect new tenant.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.835
Thorsten Schmidt. He's known
as the Nordic alchemist, right?

07:40.918 --> 07:43.171
Because he was so inventive
and so creative.

07:43.796 --> 07:44.881
Partnered with Redzepi,

07:44.964 --> 07:47.967
Thorsten has his sights set
on the dishes every Dane grew up with.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.554
And he makes them exciting again
at their restaurant, Barr.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.765
[Phil] Oh, whoa.

07:54.849 --> 07:55.725
First dish.

07:55.850 --> 07:56.809
That's a first dish?

07:56.893 --> 07:58.853
-[Thorsten] Yeah, first dish. Yeah.
-A big first--

07:58.936 --> 08:01.022
-I like when you hit 'em hard right away.
-[Thorsten] Yes.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.941
This is actually where we
dig into some of the regional classics.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.111
It's baked codfish
with white sauce and bacon.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.198
So, this is actually not baked,
it's glazed.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.492
You have a heater which has top heat.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.784
-[Phil] Yeah.
-[Thorsten] We just glaze it.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.370
And turn it and glaze it.
And turn it and glaze it.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.583
[Phil] He says it's taken out and glazed
and put back and glazed like 14 times.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.418
I'm gonna do it 14 times now for you.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.345
Double that.
What does that do to the food?

08:32.428 --> 08:33.554
It makes it unbelievable.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.266
Oh, wait a minute.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.267
[Thorsten] Ah.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.645
[Phil] Wow.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.773
[Thorsten] You get the juiciness,
but you get the glazing

08:43.856 --> 08:46.234
and we put it on bread
so you can eat the bread afterwards

08:46.317 --> 08:47.777
-with all the juices.
-Good idea.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.280
[Phil] It looks rustic and it tastes like

08:51.364 --> 08:54.033
-absolute four-star fine dining.
-[Thorsten] Yes.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.954
The trick is to get the love of grandma...

08:58.037 --> 08:58.871
[Thorsten] Yeah.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.540
...with the talent of a chef.

09:00.623 --> 09:04.168
Yeah. Sometimes we humans
have a tendency to do,

09:04.252 --> 09:07.046
"Oh, back in the days,
everything was better."

09:07.129 --> 09:08.297
Yeah, because we were kids.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.925
If you could go back and be analytical...

09:11.968 --> 09:14.262
you'd say, "Maybe that wasn't
the best piece of fish."

09:14.345 --> 09:16.305
-No.
-But this is the best piece of fish.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.017
You're borrowing from that shelf
of fine-dining knowledge

09:20.101 --> 09:22.478
and you put it, you know,
in a setting like that.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.521
-Casual.
-Casual.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.147
This is just casually amazing.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.401
-Yeah. Yeah! That's a good term actually.
-Casually amazing?

09:28.484 --> 09:29.735
Casually amazing.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.572
-Did I write your catchphrase?
-[Thorsten] You did actually there.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.698
[chuckles]

09:33.781 --> 09:36.867
-I'm going to try Mr. Schnitzel over here.
-[Thorsten] Just dig in.

09:37.285 --> 09:40.913
This sauce is pickled ramson seeds,
fresh horseradish,

09:40.997 --> 09:44.125
and underneath there's a cream,
whipped cream with horseradish.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.464
Wow.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.509
Can we go back?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.761
We should go back.
We should go back just for the--

09:55.845 --> 09:57.138
Meatballs.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.932
Here comes a meatball.
This is called a frikadeller.

10:00.016 --> 10:03.477
-Ah. Underneath the--
-Yeah, we need to frikadeller ourselves.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.980
We need to frikadeller.
Get your frikadeller on.

10:06.063 --> 10:09.859
Yes. Danish people-- It's like frikadeller
is the most Danish thing ever.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.277
-Right.
-That's a cultural thing

10:11.360 --> 10:13.613
you can find all over.
They're like meatballs.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.906
-Every country has a meatball.
-Every country has a meatball.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.367
Frikadeller is just
the Northern Europe-y part of it.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.704
And we serve it here with summer cabbage,
a little brown sauce.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.207
And underneath are the frikadeller.
So, I hope you were hungry.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.752
Yeah, I see it. It's good.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.295
What!?

10:31.589 --> 10:32.715
Oh, my God.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.425
The juiciest like--

10:34.675 --> 10:39.138
And crispy on the outside,
sumptuous meatball.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.891
Best freaking frikadeller I've ever had.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.684
-I'm so grateful to you.
-Yeah.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.478
[Phil] Here. These are for you.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.729
[Thorsten] Oh, thank you.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.898
And I paid, myself, for them. So great.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.484
[both chuckle]

10:51.567 --> 10:52.860
My kids do that to me all the time.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.364
-"Thank you, Daddy. You're so good."
-"Here's your thing."

11:01.994 --> 11:05.998
[Phil] While we're here,
my wife and daughter came to visit.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.376
My son is working on the crew

11:08.459 --> 11:10.169
and it's my son's birthday,

11:10.544 --> 11:14.340
and we thought,
"What if we had a birthday dinner

11:14.423 --> 11:17.593
at one of the best restaurants
in all of Denmark?"

11:18.260 --> 11:20.554
So we hopped
on one of these great water taxis...

11:20.930 --> 11:22.139
Hello, people!

11:23.140 --> 11:24.308
-Didn't wave back.
-Nobody waved.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.226
Nobody cares.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.270
[Phil] And we go three stops
and we're at this field.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.314
The restaurant is in the distance.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.565
Ahoy.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.485
-Ahoy.
-I say "Ahoy" because I'm a sailor man.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.445
-Took one boat ride...
-We're by the water.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.696
...and now he's a sailor.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.198
Welcome.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.199
Matt!

11:41.075 --> 11:44.870
[Phil] Matt Orlando is a chef
from San Diego, California.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.165
And Matt has worked at Per Se,
Le Bernardin, and Noma.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.669
But now, Matt has
an incredible restaurant called Amass.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.714
Matt sticks to the number one rule
of new Nordic cuisine:

11:55.798 --> 11:59.009
everything he cooks is influenced
by what's near the restaurant.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.555
-The family! There's Lily!
-Hello.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.931
-[Monica] Hello.
-There's Monica!

12:04.306 --> 12:05.349
-[Phil] There's Ben!
-Hi.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.811
-Happy birthday and...
-[Phil] Yes!

12:08.894 --> 12:09.812
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.856
Of course. I got something special
for your birthday.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.150
-Something we don't always do, so...
-[Phil] Really?

12:14.233 --> 12:17.278
So, no trip to Copenhagen is complete

12:17.361 --> 12:19.321
without a frolic
through a field of alfalfa.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.781
-[Lily] Oh, my God.
-[Monica] I love frolicking.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.992
-If you say "frolic," I'm doing it.
-Of course.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.495
[Phil] Embarrass the children.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.999
[Matt] You guys have frolicked before,
haven't you?

12:30.541 --> 12:31.584
So, alfalfa.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.752
[Phil] It's beautiful.
Look at the purple flowers.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.254
-You can eat it.
-Yeah.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.630
-Really?
-[Lily] The whole thing?

12:36.714 --> 12:37.548
I'm doing it.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.799
Oh, wow.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.885
-It's like a vegetable.
-Like a great sprout.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.387
-It's like a sweet sprout.
-Yeah.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.931
-You took the words right out of my mouth.
-Amazing.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.142
[Matt] These are called yarrow flowers.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.312
-It starts to taste like pine a little.
-[Phil] Very interesting.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.731
-And then a little bitter aftertaste.
-Exactly.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.817
-[Phil] This is...?
-[Matt] Corn flowers.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.778
[Phil] Wow! Remember Room With a View?
She puts them in her hair.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.283
One of my favorite herbs and flowers
of all-time is here.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.910
Marigolds.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.162
There's a small window
within the season

13:08.245 --> 13:12.124
where the leaves
taste like the skins of mandarin oranges.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.375
-[Phil] What?
-[Matt] Yeah.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.794
Oh, my God,
that is exactly what they taste like.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.379
[Matt] The skins of mandarin oranges.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.964
[Phil] Mm.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.090
-[Lily] Wow.
-[Matt] Yeah.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.511
Here, I'm going to make
a little salad in your hand.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.680
Then he says, "Hold out your hand.
I'm gonna make a salad in your hand."

13:27.348 --> 13:29.058
[Richard laughs]

13:29.141 --> 13:32.269
Now, I've heard this before,
and it didn't always work out so nicely.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.772
[crew laughs]

13:35.105 --> 13:36.732
[Matt] There you go. Arugula.

13:37.107 --> 13:40.277
When you eat peas and arugula
together, you get this sweet spicy.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.155
-We'll top it off with thyme flowers.
-[Phil] Excellent idea, chef.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.533
-All about presentation, right?
-[Phil] Yeah.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.745
Oh, there you go. Know what we call that?
We call that raw talent.

13:49.828 --> 13:50.746
-Get it?
-Whoa.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.457
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Somebody throw her in the water.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.042
-[Lily] Eat your salad.
-[Matt] One-biter.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.129
Mm.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.882
-That's so good.
-Yeah.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.177
Why don't I just graze here
for dinner? [chuckles]

14:05.261 --> 14:07.930
This is your birthday surprise.
Sit in the field and eat all night.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.560
[Phil] While Monica and the kids
collect the appetizer,

14:12.643 --> 14:15.187
I head into the kitchen
with Matt for the main course.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.524
Matt's surprising Ben
with his famous fried chicken.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.442
Oh, sorry if I drool a little.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.738
That's my piece. That's my piece too.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.909
Ben happens to love fried chicken.
Why? Because he's a person.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.333
[Matt chuckles]

14:36.417 --> 14:37.418
I'm going to cry.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.921
-[Matt] Recognize these?
-[Phil] Yeah.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.383
Now you get to use your extensive
knowledge of flowers.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.176
We're gonna go head-to-head.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.720
See who plates it better.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.763
Oh, well...

14:49.847 --> 14:51.473
[Matt laughs]

14:51.557 --> 14:53.350
[Matt] Fresh tomatoes
that we've just peeled.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.270
Tomatoes that we have put
in the dehydrator.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.315
Now this is a premiere dish?
You have not made this?

14:59.398 --> 15:01.275
Yeah. We have never made this dish.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.277
[Phil] These are rose petals.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.612
[Matt] Pickled in apple vinegar.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.323
I'm a fine-dining chef.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.199
[Matt] This is tomato water.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.496
Oh, boy, that's intense.

15:16.248 --> 15:20.294
[Matt] This is the oil
that's made out of the Douglas fir pine.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.463
[Phil] Oh, look at that.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.466
[Phil gasps] Look how it beads.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.593
Will it bead like that for me?

15:28.719 --> 15:29.845
-Yes.
-[Matt] Nice.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.806
[Phil] But what I did
that I noticed you didn't do--

15:32.890 --> 15:34.475
-[Matt] Hit the edge.
-[Phil] I hit the edge.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.478
-That's a little sloppy. That's an old--
-That's all right.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.521
-That's a warning, not a firing.
-Yes. Okay.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.316
[both laugh]

15:42.399 --> 15:44.276
-Next time... [gags]
-Yes.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.819
[Matt] There's no rules with flowers.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.363
Let it rain.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.616
Take a little bit of the salt,
just finish it with it.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.284
-You get that little bite.
-[Phil] Yeah.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.452
And we're done.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.622
-Shouldn't I go like this? Like the guy?
-Oh, don't do Salt Bae.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.748
Don't do it.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.251
I've ejected people from this kitchen
for less than that.

16:05.047 --> 16:09.176
♪ Happy birthday, dear Ben ♪

16:09.468 --> 16:12.638
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

16:12.721 --> 16:14.932
-[Matt] We should've had candles.
-[Phil] Fried chicken!

16:15.140 --> 16:15.975
[Monica] What?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.644
Yes! And what do you call it?
What are you calling this?

16:18.727 --> 16:21.689
This is Phil's Frolicking Flowers.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.731
[all laugh]

16:22.815 --> 16:24.733
-[Lily] I love that!
-[Phil] Isn't that sweet?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.318
Philip, did you help?

16:26.402 --> 16:27.820
-I actually helped.
-[Lily] Did you?

16:27.903 --> 16:31.198
-I apologize if it's terrible in advance.
-He was key in our success.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.034
-Thank you so much.
-Of course. Happy birthday.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.369
It looks beautiful.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.831
-I am happy to be here with my family.
-[Monica] Oh, sweetie.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.417
-Matt, you're now in the family.
-Perfect. I'll take it.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.503
There's a lot of downside,
but I'll tell you about it later.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.006
[Monica] They're gonna have to eat that.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.716
-[Ben] This is--
-[Phil] Mm.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.050
This totally works.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.260
-[Matt] Yeah?
-Come on.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.553
[Monica] So good.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.972
-[Ben] This is delicious.
-[Matt] I know you wanted the leg.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.807
This is vinegar powder over the top.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.434
All right, here we go.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.232
[Monica] Wow, that's like
no fried chicken I've ever had.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.693
-[Phil] Yeah.
-We use a flour called aryon,

17:07.776 --> 17:09.653
which is a darker flour.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.448
-A bit more rustic so you really taste it.
-[Monica] Wow, it's delicious.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.449
Look.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.034
[Phil] Monica.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.952
Oh, man.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.662
Look at the sunset, Monica!

17:20.205 --> 17:22.958
If you were looking, you would be saying
"ooh and ah" more.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.334
[all chuckling]

17:24.626 --> 17:25.753
No, this is not--

17:25.836 --> 17:28.422
-This feels unreal. It really is.
-Yeah. It really is.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.507
-I mean, it never gets old.
-Look at us.

17:30.591 --> 17:34.136
-I know. Phil--
-Matt, what can we offer you? Yes.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.764
All right. Sorry, everybody.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.183
-Sorry you had to see that.
-You ruined it.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.935
-You ruined Ben's birthday. Jeez.
-Ben's birthday.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.155
Any place that's on the water,
you want to see it from the water.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.283
Anders Selmer is another alumni of Noma.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.493
Anders!

17:57.576 --> 17:59.328
-[Anders] Hello, my friend!
-Nice to see you!

17:59.411 --> 18:01.455
-Yeah.
-Am I climbing down this thing?

18:01.538 --> 18:02.456
You have to. [chuckles]

18:02.539 --> 18:05.667
All right. Tell my wife I loved her.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.753
I met him actually in Mexico City.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.964
He was friends with some of my friends
that I made there.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.593
And he said,
"When you're in Copenhagen, look me up!"

18:15.177 --> 18:18.013
So, I did. And he has a boat.
So, I'm lucky.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.517
All right! I'm in! Let's go save Dunkirk.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.688
All right. Phil, Copenhagen.

18:26.772 --> 18:27.981
[Phil] I can't believe I'm here.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.942
It seems like a fairy tale.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.735
And what a day we have.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.366
[Anders] We have so much of the year
where we stay indoors.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.326
-[Phil] Yes.
-[Anders] That's why, in the summertime,

18:39.409 --> 18:40.619
Copenhagen is amazing.

18:40.702 --> 18:43.080
-[Phil] Yes. Yeah.
-[Anders] Because everything happens.

18:43.539 --> 18:47.793
-This is one of the most charming streets.
-Isn't it wonder-- Yeah! I love it here.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.086
[horn honks]

18:49.628 --> 18:50.629
Well, I never.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.589
[Phil] Hello, people.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.218
-Friendly town.
-[Anders] It is a friendly town.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.848
-Wow. Look at this.
-[Anders] We're in the big harbor now.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.018
So of course you see
the beautiful old buildings.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.606
And then you see
the most modern coolest buildings.

19:10.774 --> 19:11.942
This is beautiful here.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.570
The bridges for the bikes and the people.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.863
-[Anders] Yeah.
-[Phil] It's sweet.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.118
Oh, now we're going.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.536
Come on!

19:22.619 --> 19:23.912
[Anders laughs]

19:23.996 --> 19:25.330
Where are we headed now?

19:25.497 --> 19:27.457
[Anders] We are going to meet Joachim.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.294
Joachim has a project here in the harbor.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.462
[Phil] Anders turns down
a little residential canal

19:32.546 --> 19:37.009
full of adorable houseboats,
and we float over to his friend Joachim.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.512
-[Phil] Joachim! This is your house.
-[Joachim] This is my house, yeah.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.014
[Phil] You like living on a boat?

19:42.097 --> 19:43.682
[Joachim] Best place in the world.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.602
[Phil] They run something called
the Maritime Nyttehaver

19:46.685 --> 19:48.270
in the very canals that we're on.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.772
[Joachim] The project is teaching people

19:50.856 --> 19:53.400
about sustainable local food production.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.318
[Phil] Yeah.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.613
They're hanging rope under the water.
And what happens then?

19:57.696 --> 20:01.867
Mussels come and cling
and grow on the rope.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.495
And they grow for three, four, five years
before you can eat them.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.206
[Phil] All you did was hang rope?

20:07.289 --> 20:10.792
Yeah, basically if you put your foot
in the water in April...

20:10.876 --> 20:14.004
-Yeah.
-...and take it up again in September,

20:14.171 --> 20:16.757
it'll be full of baby mussels
growing on your foot.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.966
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.385
[Phil] If only I could put
my whole body in the water

20:20.469 --> 20:22.387
and come out with, uh, big muscles.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.354
-[Anders] People swim in the harbor.
-[Phil] Isn't that great?

20:30.437 --> 20:33.523
-It's that clean. No problem. Yeah.
-[Phil] That you can swim.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.944
[Phil] Look at this. This would be
like doing this in the Hudson River.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.780
Kids jumping and playing in that water.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.950
And the boats are going by,
but the water is clean.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.744
Clean enough to support food
that they're going to eat!

20:46.078 --> 20:48.580
We could do this. This seems smart to me.

20:48.872 --> 20:52.042
It's a lesson in sustainability
for the world.

20:52.459 --> 20:55.963
I read that the Danish people
are the happiest people on Earth.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.382
-Or at least in the top three.
-[Joachim] Yeah.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.967
-[Phil] Are you?
-We weren't 15 years ago.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.678
Before 15 years ago,
you weren't happy here?

21:02.761 --> 21:05.138
-No good restaurants, no good food.
-Really?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.556
[Anders] It was gray and boring.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.102
We have in many ways
a very Protestant way of looking at life.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.103
Yeah.

21:11.186 --> 21:15.399
-What is that?
-Protestant way is not enjoying anything.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.985
-Not being extravagant in anything.
-Wait a minute.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.278
That's the Jewish way.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.572
[Anders laughs]
It's, uh, very much the Protestant way.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.450
-See? We're all the same.
-[Anders chuckles]

21:25.534 --> 21:27.786
It's good to hear
you can't enjoy things also.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.705
-Yeah. Yeah.
-It makes me feel better.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.960
The church dictated that everything
that was joyful was sinful.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.628
[Phil] So, singing, dancing--

21:36.712 --> 21:40.257
[Anders] Eating. Having a party.
Anything was sinful.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.925
[Phil] So, your country,

21:42.009 --> 21:46.638
you're just now in recent history
waking up to the idea of enjoying life.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.434
[Anders] Yes. But Copenhagen
is becoming a fantastic place to live.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.437
The beauty and quality
of so many things in this city,

21:53.520 --> 21:57.024
like the architecture,
the way we build things,

21:57.107 --> 21:59.276
-the produce we have, is exceptional.
-Yeah.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.487
Party boat!

22:03.363 --> 22:06.199
Yeah, look, they're enjoying life.
I'm gonna call the church.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.117
[chuckles] Yeah.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.124
[Phil] I got a good look at the water
with Anders in his boat.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.126
Now he wants to show me
what he gets there

22:16.209 --> 22:19.129
at his seafood restaurant, Fiskebaren,

22:19.212 --> 22:21.131
in Copenhagen's meatpacking district.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.301
So you wanted to make
the best seafood restaurant

22:25.177 --> 22:27.345
in Copenhagen,

22:27.596 --> 22:31.141
-and you put it in the meat district.
-Yes, exactly. We needed it.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.851
-You can't live on meat all the time.
-No.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.437
[Phil] Fiskebaren chef Jamie Lee
joins the table

22:35.520 --> 22:37.773
with something that's definitely not meat.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.067
-Oh, baby!
-Here's your welcome.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.777
[Phil] These are massive!

22:42.194 --> 22:43.779
-These are local oysters.
-[Phil] Yeah.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.616
This oyster here is
what we call a flat bottom oyster,

22:47.699 --> 22:48.825
and the French call it Belon.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.620
It's the last native oyster in Europe.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.621
Really?

22:52.704 --> 22:55.749
[Anders] These ones.
Then this one is the Pacific oyster.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.126
And it's an invasive species,

22:58.210 --> 23:01.963
so we have to eat these fast
because they take over from these guys.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.131
[Phil] I can help with that.

23:05.967 --> 23:06.843
[Jamie] They're big.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.136
[Anders] Yeah, they're big.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.388
[Phil] That is tremendous.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.266
That's like the freshest, most delicious,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.602
hugest oyster I ever had.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.522
-Each one is a meal by itself.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

23:19.106 --> 23:21.441
[Phil] Until Anders
opened this place in 2009,

23:21.942 --> 23:23.735
seafood here wasn't easy to find.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.072
Back then, there was
one fish restaurant in Copenhagen.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.032
-What?
-One fish restaurant.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.576
You're on the water
and there's one fish restaurant?

23:31.660 --> 23:32.536
There was one.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.079
And they wore white gloves.

23:34.329 --> 23:37.082
-You had different cutleries meant for--
-Fancy schmancy.

23:37.165 --> 23:37.999
Yeah.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.335
What were they doing
with all the fish they were catch--

23:40.418 --> 23:42.254
the fisherman were catching?
Were they exporting?

23:42.712 --> 23:45.882
Ninety-eight percent goes
to Spain, Italy, and France.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.802
They love the fish from here,
because it's the best quality.

23:48.885 --> 23:55.183
It must be human nature that we don't
appreciate what's right around us. Right?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.144
-We think it's better from over there.
-Yeah.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.938
-Oh, beautiful! Wow!
-[Jamie] So, gentlemen.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.232
This is caught
from a coastal fishery as well.

24:02.357 --> 24:05.569
[Phil] We had
a beautiful, beautiful local lobster.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.154
It looked like jewelry.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.490
[Anders]
Everything we do here is so seasonal.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.577
Denmark is extremely dependent on season.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.831
-What!?
-[Anders] Yeah.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.458
What!?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.295
-Danish lobster?
-[Anders] Yeah.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.506
-[Phil] I never had that.
-It's called blue or black lobster.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.466
-[Phil] Really?
-It's the best lobster.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.219
Here comes, in a newspaper cone...

24:31.303 --> 24:32.929
-Fish and chips!
-[Jamie] Yes!

24:33.013 --> 24:35.265
Come on! Who doesn't like this?

24:35.348 --> 24:37.100
-[Anders] Everything we do...
-[Phil] Yes.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.394
...we think about sustainability

24:39.477 --> 24:41.563
and using all parts of the fish,

24:41.938 --> 24:44.149
and fish and chips came out of--

24:44.316 --> 24:46.443
We have
all of these beautiful main courses,

24:47.777 --> 24:51.198
and then, at the end,
we have all these tail pieces

24:51.531 --> 24:54.701
that's actually extremely juicy
and fantastic meat.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.953
-It's so smoky. What's so smoky?
-We make it--

24:57.037 --> 24:59.414
We smoke it in oak. Oak wood.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.875
[Phil]
You have elevated the fish and chips.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.252
Mm.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.298
-[Phil] You're from London?
-I'm from London.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.008
[Phil] You know your fish and chips.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.052
A bit of a connoisseur, actually, yeah.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.386
[Phil] This is undeniable.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.972
I mean, you would put this up
against anything in London.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.683
-Copenhagen vs. London. That'll be good.
-[Phil] No, you win.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.019
-Really?
-I'm not kidding. The best ever.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.146
Whoo-hoo!

25:33.156 --> 25:35.742
[Phil] Bicycles are a way of life
all over northern Europe,

25:35.825 --> 25:37.452
with Copenhagen leading the way.

25:37.869 --> 25:41.414
It's actually considered
the most bike-friendly city on the planet.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.293
And I was born to ride.

25:46.962 --> 25:50.465
I'm going to meet Matt so he can
show me around his favorite part of town:

25:50.548 --> 25:53.009
a magical land called Christiania.

25:54.511 --> 25:58.682
Christiania was formed
by hippies, squatters,

25:59.182 --> 26:03.103
and they formed
their own self-sustaining community.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.604
So, when was this established?

26:04.688 --> 26:06.439
-1971.
-Yeah.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.275
That's when the military moved out.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.319
And before they could do anything,
hippies moved in,

26:11.861 --> 26:14.656
and they squatted and they used
their squatter's rights to keep it.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.866
How long do you need to squat
before it's yours?

26:17.617 --> 26:20.370
-I don't-- [laughs]
-Because I have my eye on some properties.

26:21.037 --> 26:22.330
[Matt] The way it's set up is that

26:23.164 --> 26:25.250
if you want to move
into a house on a block...

26:25.333 --> 26:27.085
-[Phil] Yeah.
-...or in this area,

26:27.168 --> 26:29.421
then you have to be
approved by the people.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.881
-Like a co-op board? Yeah.
-Allow you-- Exactly.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.135
But then, once you're in,
you get the house for free.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.722
You don't pay for it. But when you leave,
you leave with nothing.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.598
You move out,
you don't get anything for it.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.058
Who would leave?

26:42.183 --> 26:43.018
Exactly.

26:43.101 --> 26:47.897
It's what the '60s
were supposed to turn into,

26:47.981 --> 26:52.152
you know, instead of all those people
going into hedge funds.

26:52.235 --> 26:56.197
Uh... This is the idealized community.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.909
They have built an infrastructure,
so they don't have to depend on--

26:59.993 --> 27:02.829
-They're not dependent on the city.
-The city. No. No.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.206
-Do they pay tax to the city?
-Not at all. No.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.085
[Matt] Back here is
the best falafel in Copenhagen.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.003
-[Phil] What?
-[Matt] Yep.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.381
[Phil] Oh. I like his squirt.
He's got a good squirt.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.716
[both chuckle]

27:15.300 --> 27:16.885
Lookie, lookie, everybody.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.182
[Matt chuckles]

27:22.432 --> 27:24.351
-[Phil] Here are some vendors.
-[Matt] Yeah.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.187
[Phil] And we're not gonna film them
because they like their privacy.

27:27.270 --> 27:30.899
Yes. There's some, uh... marijuana use.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.778
[Phil] So police don't bother them
as long as they stay contained here.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.863
[Matt]
It's almost like the Wild West out here.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.948
-[Phil] Yeah.
-You can get away with so much more.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.410
[Phil] So, it's probably a good idea
that the place is car-free.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.120
But they hardly even need them

27:44.204 --> 27:47.207
thanks to the Christiania cargo bike
that they invented.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.668
You see them all over,
even in the non-stoner parts of town.

27:58.343 --> 28:02.347
Another graduate of Noma
is former pastry chef Rosio Sanchez,

28:02.430 --> 28:04.391
who's now blowing a lot of Danish minds

28:04.474 --> 28:07.143
from a little stand
called Hija de Sanchez.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.521
At the Torvehallerne.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.523
Did I say that right? No.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.358
[man] Torvehallerne.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.318
[man laughs]

28:15.402 --> 28:19.239
[Phil] She found something missing
in Copenhagen: tacos.

28:20.949 --> 28:24.994
One of Rosio's many fans is my new friend
Marie, so she joins us for lunch.

28:26.162 --> 28:29.666
[Rosio] These are kind of the cravings
I had when I was younger.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.878
-The chilies we bring from Mexico...
-I'm getting it. [chuckles]

28:33.962 --> 28:37.715
...the corn and the spices,
and then everything else is from here.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.218
Danish food doesn't have
a lot of spice like this.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.177
No.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.638
So what did people do
when they first started having it?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.765
Were they like,
"I can't! What are you doing to me?"

28:45.849 --> 28:48.351
Well, I'm clearly still not used to it.
[laughs]

28:48.435 --> 28:50.145
That's crazy. It's pretty mild.

28:50.687 --> 28:51.813
Ooh.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.022
[chuckles]

28:53.106 --> 28:53.940
Really?

28:54.023 --> 28:56.151
Is my head on fire? [chuckles]

28:56.234 --> 28:58.319
-Yeah, your hair turned red!
-Only my hair.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.699
[Phil] The next tacos Rosio brought us are
what she learned from being in Denmark,

29:02.782 --> 29:05.160
and she's using indigenous ingredients
in these tacos.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.327
Oh.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.580
We have the quesadillas and gordita.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.749
[Rosio] We definitely use
the cheese from here.

29:10.832 --> 29:14.210
One of the other things
that I said we have to have is tomatillo.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.005
-I love tomatillo.
-I know, but you can't get it here.

29:17.088 --> 29:20.049
And then I remembered
the gooseberries have that same acidity.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.803
-So we make a--
-A gooseberry salsa! Oh, I got to go.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.932
[Rosio] This one is cod skin.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.559
-[Phil] Wow.
-[Rosio] Chicharrón.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.395
-Yes, cod skin chicharrón. I will.
-[Rosio] You want to try that first.

29:32.479 --> 29:36.107
Usually in Mexico you have
a green salsa with pork skin.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.318
-Yeah.
-So in this case we did it with fish skin,

29:38.401 --> 29:40.278
-so it's a lighter version of that.
-Ah.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.198
-You know, crunchy and...
-[Phil] I can't deny you.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.284
...it's a little bit fried.
And then we have, um...

29:46.367 --> 29:47.911
-[Phil chuckles]
-[laughs]

29:49.162 --> 29:50.371
Oh, wow.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.208
Ah, this is my favorite. This is so good.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.251
Don't you want to take over the world?

29:55.335 --> 29:56.211
[Rosio chuckles]

29:56.294 --> 29:59.464
I had a friend from L.A.
who said if that taco was in L.A.,

29:59.547 --> 30:01.090
-it'd be the best taco in L.A.
-Yes!

30:01.174 --> 30:03.301
-[Rosio laughs]
-That's what I'm saying.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.678
I think you still want dessert, right?

30:05.762 --> 30:07.514
-I'm never gonna say no to you.
-[Rosio] Perfect!

30:08.056 --> 30:10.683
[Phil] Then Rosio, because she's
a pastry chef first,

30:10.767 --> 30:13.561
makes these Danish-inspired
Mexican paletas!

30:14.103 --> 30:15.313
-Paleta!
-Oh, wow!

30:15.396 --> 30:18.024
You know what paletas are, right?
Mexican ice cream pops.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.193
-[gasps] Wow, artwork!
-[Rosio] So this is--

30:20.276 --> 30:23.947
This one is avocado ice cream
with cajeta and raspberry.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.201
And then this one is sea buckthorn.
The little orange, bright, acidic berry.

30:30.787 --> 30:31.913
Mm.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.834
I don't know if you have this word here,
but this is a creamsicle.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.919
Yes! [chuckles]

30:38.002 --> 30:39.045
Right?

30:39.546 --> 30:43.800
This one is coconut with fried cacao,
candied cacao nibs.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.010
So, we just make it, you know,

30:46.094 --> 30:49.013
very nice and creamy,
and, you know, elegant.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.515
Which one is your favorite?

30:51.057 --> 30:53.309
-This one?
-Really? Nice!

30:53.977 --> 30:57.772
It's only because I really like you
that I give this to you...

30:57.856 --> 31:00.066
-[Rosio] You can have...
-...because that's pretty awesome.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.609
-Fantastic.
-That's good.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.444
This has been the best day.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.738
[Phil] Rosio Sanchez, everybody!

31:11.828 --> 31:14.289
There's a famous architect here
named Bjarke Ingels.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.125
He's one of the greatest architects
in the world

31:17.208 --> 31:21.379
and he's got incredibly creative
and important buildings in many countries.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.883
And I fell in love with him
and his work, and I said,

31:25.091 --> 31:27.886
"Can we meet him? Maybe there's
something new that we can explore."

31:27.969 --> 31:29.345
Yes, there is!

31:29.929 --> 31:30.847
It's a park.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.851
Tell me about this place.
This is Superkilen.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.979
This is actually
the most ethnically diverse neighborhood

31:38.479 --> 31:39.480
in all of Denmark.

31:39.564 --> 31:43.234
We said, like, this project
is going to be all about ownership.

31:43.776 --> 31:48.072
Why don't we look at ethnic diversity,
cultural diversity as a positive?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.867
Then we could actually maybe
do something good.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.536
We reached out to the local community,

31:54.162 --> 31:58.082
and we asked people what elements
from your former hometown

31:58.541 --> 32:02.253
do you miss or think could actually be
a great part of your new neighborhood?

32:02.629 --> 32:06.799
We have a Moroccan fountain because
Moroccans actually have amazing traditions

32:06.883 --> 32:08.593
for architectural water features.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.763
Over there you have
this fiberglass octopus.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.473
-Yeah.
-[Bjarke] It's from Tokyo.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.934
-It's like a children magnet.
-[Phil] Fantastic.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.145
This is a Mexican love seat.

32:19.228 --> 32:20.480
-The S curve...
-Yeah?

32:20.563 --> 32:23.900
...means you're looking the person
you're sitting next to in the eyes.

32:23.983 --> 32:24.817
Really?

32:25.109 --> 32:28.279
-Let's try it, shall we? Hello.
-[man] Hello.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.532
Oh, look at you. You're very nice.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.534
Thank you very much. You too, I guess.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.452
-Phil.
-Ronnie.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.704
-Hi, Ronnie, where are you from?
-I'm from right here.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.998
Do you like this neighborhood?
Do you know who this is?

32:39.082 --> 32:42.126
Yeah, I know who it is. Hi, Bjarke.
Morning. Nice to meet you.

32:42.418 --> 32:45.672
[Bjarke] When Copenhagen transforms
because new people move here

32:45.755 --> 32:49.342
and start expressing themselves,
Danish identity also transforms.

32:49.425 --> 32:52.971
So, it becomes a true expression
of the cultural diversity

32:53.054 --> 32:54.305
of contemporary Copenhagen.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.849
-Architecture of inclusion.
-Exactly.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.228
[Phil] His park is all about the future,

33:00.770 --> 33:04.357
but Bjarke's past was the starting point
for one of his favorite projects.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.985
-This was your high school!
-[Bjarke] My high school.

33:07.068 --> 33:07.902
I think back then,

33:07.986 --> 33:12.240
high schools and hospitals
were designed in a very similar way.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.575
They want you to know
you're in an institution.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.661
-[chuckles] Yes, exactly.
-You're not here for fun.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.206
My old math teacher called me,
and she said she wanted us

33:20.289 --> 33:24.252
to look at making an actual sports hall
dimensioned to play handball.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.671
So, if you're standing
down in the sports hall

33:26.754 --> 33:28.715
and you throw a handball,

33:28.798 --> 33:31.843
-it'll trace this arch.
-[Phil] Wow.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.720
The fun is built into it,

33:33.803 --> 33:36.848
and I feel like I would have been bullied
a little bit less

33:37.390 --> 33:40.184
if my school had
this sense of fun about it.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.479
Although, they would have probably
rolled me down this.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.899
It never occurred to me
that this was the roof of something.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.610
[Phil] Whoa.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.863
[Bjarke] So, this is inside the mole hill.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.033
When we design things,
it's a bit like when you cook.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.952
You try to somehow listen
to the ingredients

33:58.036 --> 34:00.663
and you try to find out
what does this thing want to be.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.373
-Right.
-And in this case,

34:02.623 --> 34:06.252
there is something
about the purity of the ingredients...

34:06.836 --> 34:08.046
-Yeah.
-...that in a way,

34:08.379 --> 34:12.717
we haven't covered anything
in icing or sauce.

34:13.301 --> 34:16.679
It's the bare bones of the building
that become the expression.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.350
[Phil] You're doing
what I love about chefs

34:21.434 --> 34:23.936
who idealize something
from their childhood.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.855
-That's what you've done here.
-[Bjarke] Yeah.

34:25.938 --> 34:28.775
You've idealized your childhood,
literally.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.069
You practically owe it
to the next generation.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.446
And you make the world better.
How many people--

34:33.988 --> 34:35.907
-How many people have that?
-[Bjarke chuckles]

34:35.990 --> 34:39.243
Some people are blessed, you know,
with this way of seeing the world

34:39.327 --> 34:42.497
and imprinting onto the world
in a way that helps.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.297
[Phil] You might not know this
about Copenhagen,

34:51.380 --> 34:53.716
but it is famous for its hot dogs.

34:54.050 --> 34:58.221
And since I am famous for loving hot dogs,
this is going work to out very well.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.475
I'm not kidding.
Just any hot dog from any cart

35:02.558 --> 35:04.811
is gonna be one
of the best hot dogs you ever had.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.605
But today I'm going
to a gourmet one called DØP.

35:08.022 --> 35:12.026
D, O with a line through it, P. DØP.

35:13.111 --> 35:13.945
Are you Matilde?

35:14.028 --> 35:15.446
Yeah, I'm Matilde.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.407
I've done my research.
I'm trying all of them.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.617
[Matilde] Okay.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.161
[Phil] Anything you think
I should have on it, I want.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.746
[Matilde] Okay. First of all, mustard.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.082
Then the Danish sauce, rémoulade.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.584
It's like mayonnaise
with onions and pickles in it.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.627
Wow.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.587
-[Matilde] Some ketchup.
-[Phil] Yeah.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.798
-[Matilde] Fried onions.
-[Phil] Brilliant.

35:33.881 --> 35:36.050
-[Matilde] Fresh onions.
-[Phil] Fresh.

35:36.175 --> 35:37.885
[Matilde] And pickles on top.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.972
So that's the traditional Danish toppings.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.641
You know, in Chicago you call this
dragging it through the garden.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.726
-This is the Danish garden.
-[Matilde] There you go.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.353
-[Phil] Classic!
-[Matilde] Classic one.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.399
[Phil] Wow!

35:51.482 --> 35:53.317
There is nothing wrong with this.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.321
[Matilde chuckles]

35:57.405 --> 35:59.866
[Phil] Now, I don't want you
to think I'm crazy

36:00.116 --> 36:02.535
that I'm eating seven hot dogs
every night.

36:02.618 --> 36:03.452
[Matilde chuckles]

36:03.953 --> 36:07.165
I'm going to share
with these poor unfortunate...

36:08.332 --> 36:09.542
-Hello.
-...souls.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.793
-Richard.
-Thank you.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.796
Okay, the next one
is pork with wild garlic in it.

36:13.880 --> 36:14.714
-Oh.
-Yeah.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.429
Mm. Wow.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.723
I hate to give this one away!

36:24.265 --> 36:27.018
-There you go, a vegetarian hot dog.
-[Phil] A vegetarian dog.

36:28.394 --> 36:30.479
-[Matilde] What do you say?
-I say it's good.

36:30.771 --> 36:32.732
But if you do eat meat,

36:32.815 --> 36:34.692
you don't really need this one.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.027
Sorry, animals.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.488
This one is chicken.
This one is spicy beef sausage.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.991
And I can put on some spicy ketchup
if you want it.

36:42.074 --> 36:43.576
-Do it!
-[Matilde] Perfect.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.953
[Richard chuckles]

36:46.037 --> 36:48.748
The next one is pork with cheese in it.

36:48.831 --> 36:49.957
Wow.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.918
Now, you know
what I have to chase this with?

36:52.001 --> 36:53.002
Chocolate milk.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.839
Because you're not childish enough
with your hot dog.

37:02.428 --> 37:03.387
Oh.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.805
It's my new favorite combo.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.058
Like champagne and caviar.

37:07.141 --> 37:11.103
[chuckles]
Goat sausage. Goat meat with bacon in it.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.897
-Goat is very underrated.
-Yeah.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.565
Is that a traditional sausage?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.525
-It is. It is. Yeah.
-It is?

37:22.740 --> 37:23.824
If I didn't tell you...

37:26.744 --> 37:27.954
you wouldn't think goat.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.498
You would just think... "Mm."

37:31.123 --> 37:33.042
Matilde you're doing phenomenally well

37:33.125 --> 37:36.045
considering you have
an animal outside the window.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.255
[Matilde chuckles] Yeah.

37:42.551 --> 37:45.096
[Phil] Now that I've had my hot dogs,
how about some drinks?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.561
There's a New Yorker here
named Geoffrey Canilao.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.522
He opened a bar called Balderdash.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.525
Geoffrey's friends
with some of Noma's former staff.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.110
Balderdash, I say!

37:59.610 --> 38:00.736
[chuckles]

38:00.820 --> 38:02.863
[Phil] So, Rosio is here
to show me what's going on.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.826
I hear you're doing crazy stuff.

38:06.909 --> 38:09.829
We like being crazy first
with a nice shot. To say hello.

38:09.912 --> 38:11.038
We always get a shot.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.290
-Always a shot?
-Yeah.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.751
Always a shot to say hello to Rosio,
to any of our friends here.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.795
-Copenhagen snaps?
-Yeah.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.672
-Yeah.
-Good thing I had food.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.465
-Skål.
-Skål.

38:21.549 --> 38:24.427
But you got to say it
the way they do it in the bodegas here.

38:24.510 --> 38:25.594
How do they do it?

38:25.678 --> 38:29.015
You gotta go... [drawling] ...skål!

38:31.142 --> 38:32.476
-All right.
-[Geoffrey] All right.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.186
-[laughs]
-[Geoffrey] Ready?

38:34.270 --> 38:36.981
[all drawling] Skål!

38:37.064 --> 38:38.774
-Feels stupid.
-Gotta do it with everybody.

38:38.858 --> 38:39.984
[Phil] Oh, everybody, please.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.153
[Geoffrey] Do it again. Okay.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.780
[all] Skål!

38:45.531 --> 38:48.200
-[Geoffrey] You're in Copenhagen.
-Okay. Shoot it?

38:49.076 --> 38:50.453
-[Richard] Down the hatch.
-[Rosio] Mm!

38:50.911 --> 38:52.705
-[coughs]
-[Geoffrey] Are you all right?

38:53.331 --> 38:55.166
I'm glad the seat is low
so I can hang on.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.084
It was, uh, potent.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.337
[Phil] How did you two become friends?

38:59.420 --> 39:02.173
When I worked at Noma,
everyone went to this bar.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.675
And it was, like,
one of the craziest bars ever.

39:05.301 --> 39:08.387
[Phil] Maybe one of Geoffrey's specialties
has a little to do with that.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.725
Booze-infused ice cream treats.

39:13.142 --> 39:16.687
So, one thing I found out, that during
the prohibition in the United States,

39:16.771 --> 39:20.900
bartenders ended up working at soda
fountain joints and ice cream parlors.

39:20.983 --> 39:22.568
-Yes.
-So taking that creativity

39:22.651 --> 39:24.695
-of mixing different flavors...
-Yes.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.406
...they started doing milkshakes,
they started doing floats,

39:27.615 --> 39:30.701
they started doing sundaes.
So I just added booze. [chuckles]

39:30.785 --> 39:35.081
So, he made this particular creation
for Rosio and her friend Laura.

39:35.164 --> 39:36.540
It's called Rosio and Laura.

39:36.624 --> 39:40.294
It was inspired by the avocado paleta
I had at Hija de Sanchez.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.879
Avocado ice cream, yes.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.007
With freeze-dried raspberries on top.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.636
Then, just for fun,
he puts crickets on it.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.137
[Rosio] Chapulines.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.640
[Geoffrey]
It's a salted grasshopper with spice.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.102
-Enjoy!
-You've had grasshoppers, huh? In Mexico?

39:56.185 --> 39:57.144
[Geoffrey &amp; Rosio] No?

39:57.728 --> 40:01.524
What takes your mind off of that
is that it's soaked

40:01.982 --> 40:03.859
through and through with tequila.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.736
-Please.
-Yeah.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.114
Yum.

40:08.197 --> 40:11.659
-I'm not avoiding the grasshopper.
-But if it falls, you won't pick it up?

40:13.494 --> 40:15.621
[Phil] Whoa, I got a tequila brain freeze.

40:16.705 --> 40:17.581
Oh, boy.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.543
It's fantastic.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.546
-[Rosio] I love the salt in there.
-[Geoffrey] Like a cocktail,

40:23.629 --> 40:25.881
but the key is to find, like,
childlike sensation.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.050
-[Phil] By the way--
-Eating ice cream and a milkshake.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.261
Yes! I'm a child again.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.222
And soon I'll be dancing around
like a child.

40:33.305 --> 40:35.182
Then he makes us a banana split.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.435
And the bananas are soaked in rum

40:37.518 --> 40:39.770
with chocolate, vanilla,
and strawberry ice cream

40:39.854 --> 40:41.814
also infused with alcohol.

40:42.189 --> 40:43.983
And then the whipped cream,

40:44.066 --> 40:47.236
it's infused with something
called beaver castoreum.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.946
It's beaver gland.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.114
Beaver what?

40:50.197 --> 40:51.157
[Geoffrey] Beaver gland.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.366
-Gland?
-[Geoffrey] Yes.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.119
They use beaver gland
for synthetic vanilla extracts.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.496
-Didn't know that.
-[Geoffrey] They were cheap.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.415
It doesn't make me want it any more.

40:59.498 --> 41:00.624
[Geoffrey] Want to smell it?

41:00.708 --> 41:01.876
-No!
-As is?

41:02.626 --> 41:03.794
I do. I want to smell it.

41:04.336 --> 41:05.379
It says beaver on it.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.131
[Rosio laughs]

41:07.214 --> 41:08.716
[Geoffrey] It's beaver juice.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.510
And you have a little chocolate syrup.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.636
That I like.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.847
[Geoffrey] But we did it with seaweed,
a kombu.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.515
[Rosio and Richard laughing]

41:16.599 --> 41:20.936
So, just a touch of that to give
that saltiness or umami background.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.147
All right, you're very strange,
but I like you.

41:24.565 --> 41:25.441
[Geoffrey] Enjoy!

41:33.282 --> 41:35.951
-Excellent beaver, Geoffrey!
-Oh, perf!

41:38.329 --> 41:40.789
Now, wait, we didn't have yours.
The one about you.

41:40.873 --> 41:41.707
We did have it.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.209
-Which one, this one?
-That one.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.753
-Yeah, that's the Rosio and Laura.
-Oh, that's you!

41:46.545 --> 41:48.047
Maybe I'm drunk and I forgot.

41:49.381 --> 41:53.260
I maybe had too many ice cream treats,
and then I needed a ride home.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.354
[Phil] And speaking of rides...

42:06.899 --> 42:08.609
[screaming]

42:08.692 --> 42:11.529
Ben and Lily's birthdays
are actually one day apart.

42:11.612 --> 42:12.905
Yes, that's how we do it.

42:12.988 --> 42:16.534
So, we're also celebrating Lily's birthday
while we're here.

42:16.617 --> 42:19.787
She actually found out
about Tivoli Gardens,

42:19.870 --> 42:21.580
and she said,
"Can we do that for my birthday?"

42:21.664 --> 42:24.166
So, you know,
I'm a stupid dad, and I said yes.

42:24.708 --> 42:28.087
A little more beautiful
than amusement parks at home, right?

42:28.170 --> 42:29.964
-Yeah, a little.
-It is gorgeous.

42:30.047 --> 42:32.049
[Phil] Look at all the trees and flowers.

42:32.132 --> 42:36.095
It's beautiful, first of all.
It's from, like, 1843,

42:36.637 --> 42:39.765
and it's one
of the world's first amusement parks.

42:40.099 --> 42:45.729
And Walt Disney was inspired here to
return to America and take all our money.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.940
This is the original happiest place.

42:48.023 --> 42:51.193
Although the Danish Goofy costume
is a little different.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.861
-You've been on every ride?
-Yes.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.072
-What's your favorite?
-The old wooden rollercoaster.

42:55.447 --> 42:58.075
-So, um... want to go on that one?
-I want that one.

42:58.617 --> 43:00.911
[Phil] We will.
We might have to work up to it.

43:00.995 --> 43:02.288
-Look at the swings.
-[Lily gasps]

43:02.371 --> 43:04.039
-Let's do it! Let's do it!
-[Phil] No, no.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.041
-I believe in you.
-No, I'm afraid.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.961
It is amazing that for hundreds of years

43:09.044 --> 43:16.010
people have sought out
this feeling of wanting to get nauseous.

43:16.635 --> 43:18.053
This I might be able to handle.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.640
I like a nice ride.
A Ferris wheel is a nice ride.

43:22.016 --> 43:24.393
Not if it goes too fast, but just nice.

43:25.060 --> 43:25.936
I'm scared!

43:27.438 --> 43:28.689
Is it going too fast, Lily?

43:28.772 --> 43:30.691
-It's not going fast--
-A little fast for me.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.944
Is it too fast? You're going
to do that one, too. The rollercoaster.

43:34.028 --> 43:34.862
[whimpers]

43:35.654 --> 43:38.115
I remember when I took you to Disneyland.

43:38.198 --> 43:41.327
I think you were five, maybe.

43:41.410 --> 43:43.662
-And you said...
-[chuckles] This story is terrible.

43:43.746 --> 43:47.166
-..."I want to go and stay overnight..."
-Yes.

43:47.249 --> 43:49.835
"...and have two days
and I want to go to both parks."

43:49.918 --> 43:51.795
So, I got the both park tickets.

43:52.046 --> 43:55.758
We got to the rooms
at the big Disney hotel.

43:56.050 --> 44:01.513
And we got there, and we waited
on line for the Dumbo ride.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.932
And we went on the Dumbo ride.
We waited for an hour,

44:04.016 --> 44:07.686
and we went on the one ride,
and you said, "Okay, let's go home now."

44:07.770 --> 44:12.232
-[laughs] I'm sorry.
-It cost $850.

44:13.359 --> 44:14.985
-I'm sorry.
-You owe me!

44:18.238 --> 44:19.990
-This is pretty good though.
-This I like.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.075
[Lily] This you like.

44:22.951 --> 44:23.827
[riders scream]

44:23.911 --> 44:25.412
[Phil] Lily wanted
to go on the rollercoaster.

44:25.496 --> 44:28.707
This is something
I stopped doing 20 years ago

44:28.791 --> 44:31.669
because, I don't know,
if you're like me, you hit a certain age

44:31.752 --> 44:35.005
and that whoo-hoo feeling
turns into, "Oh, no."

44:39.176 --> 44:40.844
[Lily] Ready? Are you ready?

44:40.928 --> 44:43.347
[screaming]

44:49.228 --> 44:50.646
[Lily] This is so great!

44:51.438 --> 44:53.857
I read this,
that when you're on such rides,

44:54.191 --> 44:58.570
the reason you feel like you're,
you know, getting a little sick

44:58.821 --> 45:02.116
is because your organs are literally
moving around in your body.

45:02.199 --> 45:05.536
Don't move my organs!
I like them where they are!

45:05.619 --> 45:07.996
[screaming]

45:15.337 --> 45:16.630
[Lily laughing]

45:16.713 --> 45:18.006
Look at Dad.

45:23.512 --> 45:24.930
[Lily] All right, we leave Phil now.

45:27.182 --> 45:28.183
[Monica] All right.

45:28.767 --> 45:29.768
Can we go?

45:32.938 --> 45:33.897
[Lily] I'm stuck.

45:37.443 --> 45:38.444
All right, Dad.

45:38.527 --> 45:40.737
Good luck to you. I'm gonna go.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.876
[Phil] That is Copenhagen.

45:53.959 --> 45:56.295
You can be having
the sunniest, most perfect day

45:56.378 --> 46:01.258
and all of a sudden, rain.
Crazy. Got to go underneath something.

46:02.050 --> 46:04.928
Play one of those games
where your little girl beats you.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.308
[Phil] This is a stupid game because
I am very bad at it.

46:15.105 --> 46:16.732
-Yes!
-What!?

46:16.815 --> 46:18.984
[laughs]

46:19.276 --> 46:20.652
Boo!

46:20.736 --> 46:21.862
[Phil] Oh!

46:21.945 --> 46:24.031
[Phil] I can't win today,
but it doesn't matter.

46:24.114 --> 46:27.493
There's nothing better than seeing
your kid's face light up like that.

46:27.784 --> 46:30.787
And because I'm a nice dad
and because this is Copenhagen

46:30.871 --> 46:34.833
and the rain stopped after seven minutes,
I took Lily on one last ride.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.460
[Phil] This is the Dumbo ride.

46:36.543 --> 46:39.588
[Lily] This is the Dumbo ride, but it's
better because we're in Copenhagen.

46:39.755 --> 46:40.964
[Phil] Take us up. Up!

46:41.715 --> 46:43.300
-[Lily] I'm going up!
-[Phil] All the way.

46:43.842 --> 46:44.885
See? I'm brave.

46:47.721 --> 46:49.181
What we do for our kids.

46:49.848 --> 46:50.933
[retches]

46:51.099 --> 46:52.518
All right. Sorry.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.481
[Phil] I need a little something
to settle my stomach.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.446
So, people are telling me,
"You gotta have this burger."

47:04.530 --> 47:07.491
I'm like, "I didn't come to Denmark
for a burger. I can get a burger at home."

47:08.659 --> 47:09.785
Just like the hot dog...

47:11.078 --> 47:12.329
you have to try this.

47:12.996 --> 47:16.792
Klaus Wittrup was an exchange student,
lived in Indiana for a while,

47:16.875 --> 47:20.128
and then he worked
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,

47:20.546 --> 47:23.090
and he fell in love with burgers.

47:24.216 --> 47:27.636
And he opened a burger stand
in a gas station.

47:28.136 --> 47:30.222
This is the Gasoline Grill.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.100
I love the smell of gasoline
when I'm eating!

47:33.183 --> 47:35.018
Yeah! [laughs]

47:35.102 --> 47:38.355
-How are you? Klaus. Nice to meet you.
-Great to meet you. How are you?

47:38.438 --> 47:41.483
I have to say, the moment you smell this,

47:42.234 --> 47:44.486
all thoughts of a gas station go away...

47:44.570 --> 47:46.780
-Yeah.
-...and you're just in burger land.

47:46.863 --> 47:47.864
-I hope so.
-In heaven.

47:47.948 --> 47:51.118
-Do you run the gas station, too?
-[Klaus] No, no, unfortunately not.

47:51.201 --> 47:52.578
Just the burger place.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.496
What made you go into burgers?

47:54.580 --> 47:57.040
My first meal
when I got to America was a burger.

47:57.374 --> 47:58.417
-[Phil] Of course.
-Yeah.

47:58.500 --> 48:01.086
They don't let you in the country
without giving you a burger.

48:01.169 --> 48:02.462
Exactly. [laughs]

48:02.546 --> 48:06.425
I remember that really like
juicy and fatty taste.

48:06.508 --> 48:08.594
-[Phil] Yes.
-And I wanted to replicate that.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.095
I'm getting a little excited.

48:10.470 --> 48:12.514
They tell me you have a line all the time.

48:12.598 --> 48:15.309
[Klaus] Yeah. See, we make
a fixed number every day.

48:15.517 --> 48:17.853
And then we sell out every day,
and then we close.

48:18.145 --> 48:19.021
Oh.

48:19.855 --> 48:21.023
That's not for me?

48:21.273 --> 48:22.190
[Klaus] No.

48:22.566 --> 48:25.527
Oh, we had to wait
for the line to die down. Now, I go.

48:25.611 --> 48:27.613
-[man] We're sold out now.
-Is that true?

48:27.696 --> 48:29.906
[man] Yeah, we're sold out.
We don't have any more burgers.

48:29.990 --> 48:31.158
That's not funny.

48:31.241 --> 48:32.409
[laughs]

48:32.492 --> 48:33.452
What's your name?

48:33.535 --> 48:34.369
I'm Johannes.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.454
-Johannes.
-Yeah.

48:35.537 --> 48:38.290
-How long have you worked here?
-I actually just started last month.

48:38.373 --> 48:39.207
-You did?
-Yeah.

48:39.291 --> 48:41.001
-How's he working out?
-[Klaus] Good.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.711
'Cause he's got an attitude. I'm not sure.

48:42.794 --> 48:44.171
We've had worse.

48:45.339 --> 48:47.215
-There's an endorsement!
-[laughs]

48:47.299 --> 48:49.092
Yeah, I'm glad I'm not the worst one here.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.970
Put that on the resume.
"They've had worse than me!"

48:52.054 --> 48:53.096
[Klaus laughs] Yeah.

48:53.764 --> 48:54.723
No, he's really good.

48:58.101 --> 49:00.062
-What? Me?
-Yeah.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.606
[Klaus] I think you should try
the butter burger.

49:02.689 --> 49:03.899
-Butter burger?
-[Klaus] Yeah.

49:04.107 --> 49:06.151
So, there's no cheese on this burger.

49:06.234 --> 49:08.570
-[Klaus] No. Yeah.
-There's a slab of butter on this burger.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.658
[Phil] You know, it sounds odd at first,
but when you think about it,

49:12.741 --> 49:14.701
-you get a steak with butter.
-Exactly.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.162
-Fried meat and butter is really good.
-Here we go.

49:17.245 --> 49:20.499
Fried meat and butter
is really good. Go figure.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.084
[Klaus] Let me get you some napkins.

49:26.505 --> 49:28.131
-Wow.
-[Klaus laughs]

49:28.215 --> 49:31.635
[Phil] Come on! What's on there?
There's onion on there.

49:31.718 --> 49:33.428
[Klaus] Onion, pickles, and butter.

49:33.512 --> 49:36.431
-I need to eat more.
-[Klaus] Yeah.

49:36.515 --> 49:39.059
[laughs]

49:39.142 --> 49:40.686
[Phil] To come somewhere,

49:41.228 --> 49:43.522
have an experience,
love that experience,

49:44.106 --> 49:47.401
be so influenced by the experience
that it changes your life.

49:47.484 --> 49:48.318
-Yeah.
-Right?

49:48.402 --> 49:49.820
-This is you now.
-Exactly.

49:49.903 --> 49:55.200
But then me traveling here to discover
someone who traveled to where I live,

49:55.283 --> 49:58.912
came back and did something
that's as good, if not better...

49:58.995 --> 50:00.622
-Thank you.
-...than what's at home.

50:01.289 --> 50:02.499
One more, you don't mind.

50:02.582 --> 50:04.209
[Klaus laughs]

50:05.377 --> 50:06.837
-[Phil] Johannes?
-Yeah?

50:06.920 --> 50:07.921
This is very good!

50:08.296 --> 50:09.756
Thank you very much.

50:10.090 --> 50:12.259
Don't take credit.
He's standing right here.

50:12.342 --> 50:14.886
I know, I know, but I work here too.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.638
-Okay.
-That's right.

50:17.389 --> 50:18.348
Good job!

50:18.557 --> 50:20.225
-[Johannes] Thank you very much!
-He can stay.

50:20.308 --> 50:22.185
-[Klaus] I'll give him a raise.
-[Phil] Okay.

50:22.269 --> 50:26.106
A raise! Yes! Give him a good raise.
In fact, a raise for everybody.

50:26.189 --> 50:27.691
I'll remember that. [chuckles]

50:28.734 --> 50:30.152
[Phil] I'm in a gas station!

50:32.154 --> 50:33.864
[ringing]

50:35.073 --> 50:37.659
[Phil] Oh! [chuckles]

50:37.743 --> 50:39.745
What a nice shirt you have on.

50:39.828 --> 50:41.830
Oh. Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

50:41.913 --> 50:43.665
When were you in Copenhagen?

50:43.749 --> 50:45.375
About ten years ago, I think.

50:45.751 --> 50:46.585
You liked it?

50:47.210 --> 50:48.086
Loved it.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.504
It's very beautiful.

50:49.588 --> 50:51.381
-Yeah.
-Did you have breakfast yet?

50:51.465 --> 50:53.633
-No, I'm having my coffee.
-No. Me too.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.719
You know what you get
in Denmark, right?

50:56.720 --> 50:57.804
Herring.

50:57.888 --> 50:59.890
Danish in Denmark! Danish!

51:00.098 --> 51:01.641
-[chuckles]
-Oh, it's a Danish.

51:05.854 --> 51:07.439
That looks very sweet.

51:07.522 --> 51:09.941
You know what they call them here? Pastry.

51:10.025 --> 51:12.402
-Well, it is pastry. That's what it is.
-Yes!

51:12.486 --> 51:15.989
They don't need to call it Danish.
We call it Danish.

51:16.072 --> 51:19.242
We spoke to your wife yester--
a couple of days ago.

51:19.326 --> 51:20.535
No, yesterday.

51:20.619 --> 51:21.953
I have to, but you?

51:22.037 --> 51:25.373
She likes Copenhagen.
I think she likes Copenhagen.

51:25.457 --> 51:27.375
And Lily. Lily loved Copenhagen.

51:27.459 --> 51:29.961
But I had to go on the rollercoaster
with her twice.

51:30.045 --> 51:31.046
I almost threw up.

51:31.129 --> 51:32.547
She likes rollercoasters?

51:32.631 --> 51:34.007
-She wanted to go!
-You went with her?

51:34.090 --> 51:36.092
I went. The whole family went.

51:36.176 --> 51:38.053
Ben and I, we were not crazy about it.

51:38.136 --> 51:39.346
How's Ben?

51:39.721 --> 51:42.224
Ben is good! You want to say hi to Ben?

51:42.307 --> 51:43.725
-Yes.
-Say hello to Ben.

51:43.809 --> 51:44.643
Ben, come here!

51:45.435 --> 51:47.646
-[Helen] Oh, please stop...
-Look! Here's my boy. Look!

51:47.729 --> 51:49.439
-Hello.
-She's leaving.

51:49.523 --> 51:52.234
-Oh, bye. Hi, Grandpa.
-Hi!

51:53.276 --> 51:54.861
-You look great, Ben.
-Thank you.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.530
-Are you enjoying it?
-Yes.

51:56.613 --> 51:58.198
Are you enjoying your time there?

51:58.281 --> 52:00.033
Yeah, it's great here. Yeah.

52:00.116 --> 52:01.743
-Very nice.
-Hi, Grandma.

52:01.827 --> 52:02.661
And...

52:02.744 --> 52:06.206
Hi, there.
So, how do you like Copenhagen?

52:06.289 --> 52:09.960
It's really fun. I've been working.
But it's really nice here.

52:10.252 --> 52:12.295
We went for fried chicken
on Ben's birthday.

52:12.379 --> 52:14.256
How is the fried chicken over there?

52:14.339 --> 52:16.049
Good. It was special fried chicken.

52:16.132 --> 52:17.968
It's not like normal--

52:18.051 --> 52:19.386
It's not like New York?

52:19.469 --> 52:20.929
-No.
-How was it different?

52:21.012 --> 52:22.305
-It had vinegar powder.
-Spice--

52:22.389 --> 52:25.934
Vinegar? Forget that.
That's the end of that chicken.

52:26.017 --> 52:28.353
-[Max] You know--
-[both laughing]

52:29.646 --> 52:31.273
-Bye. Have a good day.
-Good to see you.

52:31.356 --> 52:32.440
Thank you. You too.

52:32.941 --> 52:36.194
Listen, let me show you
the weather outside. Wait one second.

52:37.821 --> 52:38.780
Max, you got to--

52:39.698 --> 52:40.740
What are you doing?

52:43.827 --> 52:44.744
[Max] Can you see?

52:44.911 --> 52:48.164
-Yes. That's fantastic.
-[Max] It's a little hazy, but...

52:48.582 --> 52:50.709
That's a very good view
everyone's getting.

52:51.209 --> 52:52.210
Thank you.

52:52.294 --> 52:55.046
I think this will be our shot
from now on when we call you.

52:55.130 --> 52:56.131
[Helen] What?

52:56.631 --> 52:58.967
Instead of looking at you,
we'll just look at this.

52:59.301 --> 53:00.677
[Max] Right. Isn't that nicer?

53:00.760 --> 53:02.178
[Phil laughs]

53:02.262 --> 53:04.806
[Helen and Max laugh]

53:04.890 --> 53:07.225
[Max] Stay well and regards to Richard.

53:07.309 --> 53:08.310
Nope.

53:15.650 --> 53:18.361
[Phil] Sometimes there's this thing
called vacation magic,

53:18.445 --> 53:20.697
where if you think something's
not gonna work out,

53:20.780 --> 53:22.866
it works out better
than you could have imagined.

53:23.408 --> 53:26.161
So, we were just about to leave town
when I get a call from Geoffrey.

53:26.745 --> 53:30.290
He wants me to meet him and his friend
Sune at this place down by the water.

53:30.832 --> 53:34.002
So, I go, and it turns out
it's not just some place by the water.

53:34.085 --> 53:35.795
It's a Noma pop-up.

53:35.879 --> 53:38.173
Yes! Noma under the bridge.

53:38.340 --> 53:42.719
By some miracle, I'm actually gonna get
my taste of Noma after all.

53:42.802 --> 53:43.887
I can't believe it.

53:44.429 --> 53:47.098
Here you've got
these beautiful, local fjord shrimps.

53:47.182 --> 53:50.060
Take a good spoonful of them
into the middle of the taco.

53:50.602 --> 53:51.770
[Phil] Tacos, people!

53:52.187 --> 53:55.941
The chefs from Noma, while they're
waiting for Noma 2.0 to be built,

53:56.024 --> 53:59.277
are making food
that they would want to eat.

53:59.653 --> 54:02.572
This is our warm broth
of smoked cod heads and bones,

54:02.656 --> 54:05.700
with grilled baby cucumbers
and spicy ginger oil.

54:05.784 --> 54:06.785
Mm.

54:06.868 --> 54:07.953
Yeah. That's what I mean.

54:08.036 --> 54:09.037
[laughs]

54:09.120 --> 54:10.038
There's so much flavor!

54:10.121 --> 54:12.290
-Hello, again!
-Hello!

54:12.374 --> 54:14.292
You are my favorite people.
Have I told you?

54:14.376 --> 54:16.711
-[all laughing]
-[Phil] Well, that's beautiful!

54:17.253 --> 54:19.172
[Phil] How good could a potato be?

54:19.255 --> 54:22.300
You know, do I have to go to Noma
for a potato?

54:23.218 --> 54:24.719
It turns out, yes, you do.

54:24.803 --> 54:27.180
It's not just me, right?
This is crazy delicious.

54:28.181 --> 54:29.015
Look at that!

54:29.099 --> 54:31.643
This is two Magnums. It's a Jeroboam.

54:32.268 --> 54:36.022
Jeroboam! It's my second favorite size
after Nebuchadnezzar.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.774
[laughs]

54:40.151 --> 54:44.030
[Phil] I got to say, I'm a little in love
with wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen.

54:44.406 --> 54:49.160
The Danish love of style and creativity
that Noma reignited is alive and well,

54:49.327 --> 54:50.453
but it's more than that.

54:51.079 --> 54:54.332
Maybe it's what Bjarke calls
hedonistic sustainability.

54:54.874 --> 54:57.502
Listen, why can't environmentalism
be sexy?

54:57.585 --> 55:00.547
Healthy food actually be
the more delicious choice?

55:00.839 --> 55:04.259
It just seems like everybody here
is looking out for everybody else.

55:04.426 --> 55:05.885
And that feeling is all around,

55:06.511 --> 55:07.679
and it's really nice.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.016
It doesn't hurt
that these are all around you too.

55:11.099 --> 55:13.059
-Hi! Number four.
-[woman] Hi.

55:13.143 --> 55:15.061
-Yes. With everything?
-[Phil] With everything.

55:20.942 --> 55:22.569
[Richard] Why'd you get another hot dog?

55:22.944 --> 55:27.157
I've got the fever,
and the only cure is more hot dogs.
