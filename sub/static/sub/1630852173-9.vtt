WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:12.312
- Okay, who ate
my last applesauce?

00:12.379 --> 00:14.247
- You did; I saw you eating it
with your hands

00:14.347 --> 00:15.648
the last time you were drunk.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.250
Oh, good to know.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.053
- Hey, ladies, have you guys
read the paper today?

00:20.153 --> 00:21.755
- Our school paper?
- Mm-hmm.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.723
- I have never
looked at it once.

00:23.823 --> 00:25.058
Look.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.826
Whitney,
apparently your soccer coach

00:26.893 --> 00:28.928
had an affair with a player
and was fired.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.097
Dude, are you serious?

00:31.197 --> 00:32.599
Yeah, I've heard about it,

00:32.699 --> 00:33.700
but the details
are pretty vague.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.703
Whoa, this is juicy.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.105
This is, like,
"Red Table Talk"-level juice.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.207
Wait, is this coach hot?
Is the girl hot?

00:41.274 --> 00:43.109
Did they get caught having
steamy sex in the showers?

00:43.209 --> 00:46.212
We want every lurid detail.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.381
It's...

00:49.916 --> 00:50.784
Me.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.285
- What?
- Seriously?

00:52.385 --> 00:54.587
- Well, it was me, but we
ended things a while ago.

00:54.687 --> 00:56.122
And you can't
say anything to anyone.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.690
If my mom finds out,
she will kill us all.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.359
I'm not even sure
if I'm exaggerating.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.460
Yeah, okay, of course.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.429
- Whatever you need.
- Thanks.

01:02.529 --> 01:03.630
- Whitney, you might
want to read this.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.931
You know what? I don't.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.633
- No, it says he did this
with another girl

01:06.733 --> 01:08.068
when he worked at Ithaca.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.770
What the fuck?

01:15.041 --> 01:16.276
Doesn't matter.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.278
It's done,
so doesn't change anything.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.446
I'm gonna go take a shower.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.174
<i>- So you're going</i>
<i>to the Title IX office?</i>

01:48.274 --> 01:51.244
- Yeah, Alicia said I should
go learn about all my options.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.679
Figure out the best way
to handle

01:52.779 --> 01:54.147
a gross dude
with a weirdly shaped dick.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.482
Weirdly shaped how?

01:55.582 --> 01:57.016
- I mean, I only felt it
against my back,

01:57.117 --> 01:59.786
but it felt like a can of soup
but squishier.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.288
- You might not need
to mention his dick shape.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.257
- I think it's best
to lay it all on the table.

02:04.324 --> 02:08.361
Ladies, I will see you all
on the other side.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.630
- Good luck, Bela.
Yes, all women.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.365
- So what about you,
Miss Thing?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.100
How you doing since Nico's?

02:17.637 --> 02:18.671
I'm hanging in there.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.373
Oh, shit.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.875
Have y'all not talked
about this?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.276
- Should I go?
- No.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.677
No, no, no,
let's talk about it.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.046
- Totally, let's do it.
I'll start.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.382
I know that I sort of kept it
from you, and that wasn't cool.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.351
In the future,
I'll be more honest.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.387
In that spirit,

02:34.487 --> 02:36.856
my UTI was not
from a wet library chair.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.392
It was from repetitive sex
with your brother.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.227
Okay, that's haunting.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.030
And yes, it kind of sucked
to figure out

02:44.130 --> 02:46.900
that everybody was keeping
this big secret behind my back.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.535
- I should've told you.
- Yes.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.637
Yes, you should have,
because I would've told you

02:50.703 --> 02:52.572
not to sleep with him,
'cause I would've told you

02:52.672 --> 02:54.140
he has a girlfriend.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.508
Yeah, that's a good point.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.910
Leighton,
your brother looks good,

02:57.010 --> 02:58.344
but that boy
wasn't raised right.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.346
- Why are you telling me?
I'm not him.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.748
- But at least
you got to hook up

03:01.848 --> 03:03.216
with a guy who's
way out of your league.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.251
- Hey!
- Listen, I don't take sides.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.586
I just tell the truth.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.992
<i>- His penis felt like</i>
<i>a can of soup?</i>

03:13.059 --> 03:14.761
- Yeah, I only mention it
in case I need

03:14.861 --> 03:17.730
to identify his penis, like,
in a police lineup situation.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.199
Right.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.067
Well, I will note that.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.936
So now what?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.437
Do you tell Ryan,

03:24.537 --> 03:26.673
or when exactly do you tell
my strict Indian parents?

03:26.739 --> 03:29.209
I need to warn them
and possibly flee the country.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.710
Or do you provide any sort

03:30.777 --> 03:32.412
of sexual witness protection
program?

03:32.512 --> 03:34.948
- If that's an option,
I'd like to hear about that.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.183
- There's no need to get
ahead of yourselves here.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.885
This is our first talk.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.120
The next step would be
to submit a written statement,

03:41.221 --> 03:43.223
and based on that,
my colleagues and I

03:43.289 --> 03:45.358
would decide
if we need to intervene

03:45.425 --> 03:47.427
to protect
the larger community.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.062
Otherwise, it's your choice

03:49.128 --> 03:51.130
if we move forward
with an investigation.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.199
At this time,
my recommendation would be

03:53.266 --> 03:55.735
for you to do everything
you can to avoid Ryan,

03:55.802 --> 03:58.271
which means taking a break
from "The Catullan."

03:58.371 --> 03:59.706
Uh, no.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.441
Ricky, do you know
how far behind you can fall

04:01.541 --> 04:03.776
in camaraderie building
if you miss two or three days?

04:03.876 --> 04:06.412
- I was actually gonna
suggest a few weeks.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.815
A few weeks?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.149
Okay, Ricky, it's official.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.818
You do not know
how comedy works.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.786
And I'm fine with that.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.123
- And that's why
I was late all the time

04:17.223 --> 04:18.725
and slacking off
and just, like,

04:18.791 --> 04:20.393
ruining every other aspect
of my life.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.495
And little did I know,
I was getting two-timed

04:22.595 --> 04:23.763
by that mother-effer.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.598
- Go off, girl.
- Yeah.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.767
- And when you do, can you
do it near the milk frother?

04:27.834 --> 04:29.435
Because I've asked you
to clean it repeatedly.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.504
I will. I'm sorry.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.140
I just get so angry
when I talk about Nico.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.242
I could just...

04:36.309 --> 04:38.911
- Damn,
I've never seen you like this.

04:38.978 --> 04:40.480
It's kind of cute.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.515
Like when Nemo gets mad
at his dad.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.684
- He just made me
feel like such an idiot.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.853
- Yeah,
well, for what it's worth,

04:46.953 --> 04:49.489
I see you with more
of a sweet boy.

04:49.589 --> 04:53.259
You know,
someone named Eugene or Glenn.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.461
Type of guy
who likes to play board games,

04:55.528 --> 04:57.664
wears New Balances
with cargo shorts.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.199
- You're describing nerds.
- Yes. Yes, I am.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.802
I think you should date a nerd.
I'm glad you picked up on that.

05:02.869 --> 05:05.004
Oh, getting ready
for tomorrow's econ midterm?

05:05.104 --> 05:06.472
- Mm-hmm.
- Is this the practice test?

05:06.539 --> 05:08.007
- Wait, please don't. I--

05:08.107 --> 05:10.009
Oh, shit.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.712
This is the test.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.547
Are you gonna use this?

05:14.647 --> 05:16.849
- I am
but only 'cause I have to.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.718
It's my only way
to stay on track.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.287
Otherwise, my whole life plan
is gonna be thrown off

05:21.354 --> 05:23.222
because I have
a D on my transcript.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.858
- Yeah, but, like,
you're gonna get caught.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.460
You're not smooth enough
to cheat.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.295
I most certainly am.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.897
No, lies. You're not.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.498
The test is, like,
three hours long.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.867
Even if you had a basic
understanding of econ,

05:34.967 --> 05:36.169
which you don't,

05:36.235 --> 05:37.737
it's hard as hell
to memorize all that.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.806
- Well, that's why
I have a little plan.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.074
A little plan?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.675
What are you gonna--
you know what?

05:42.742 --> 05:45.411
No, don't tell me.
Just please don't cheat.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.913
You are not equipped
to pull that off.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.214
I am.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.049
- You're sweating
just talking about it.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.417
That's not sweat.

05:53.152 --> 05:54.420
I don't know what that is.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.389
Okay.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.533
What's up?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.769
What's up? Are you serious?

06:09.869 --> 06:12.271
You hooked up with my roommate
and made me look like an idiot.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.673
- That's what's up.
- Okay, can you

06:13.740 --> 06:15.341
keep your voice down?
Maya's upstairs.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.343
Oh, my God, you are so gross.

06:17.410 --> 06:18.544
Okay, I get it. You're mad.

06:18.611 --> 06:19.879
But what did you
want me to do,

06:19.946 --> 06:21.280
text you and say,
"Hey, Leight, is it cool

06:21.381 --> 06:22.782
if I bone your roommate
real quick?"

06:22.882 --> 06:24.183
- Yeah, well I, didn't think
I had to tell you

06:24.250 --> 06:25.451
not to fuck
any of my roommates,

06:25.551 --> 06:26.886
but now
I will make it official.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.355
Do not have sex
with any of my roommates.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.358
She's really upset, by the way.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.460
Okay, she's not used
to guys like you.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.295
You should've seen the boy
who came to visit her.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.630
He looked like a goat.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.298
- What do you want me
to do about it?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.767
- Oh, I don't know, try not
being such a total D-bag

06:40.867 --> 06:42.301
and make things right
with Kimberly.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.636
- Okay, I will.
- Today.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.138
- Fine.
- Like, in person.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.472
- Great.
- Good.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.274
Nico, are you downstairs?

06:48.374 --> 06:49.909
- Yeah, I'm just dealing
with something.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.444
I'll be right up.

06:51.544 --> 06:55.148
- You are one of the grossest
men I am related to.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.983
Worse than weird Uncle Mark.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.818
Apologize today, Nico.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.156
- We get the opportunity
to just show up.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.624
Everything that
we've trained in,

07:04.724 --> 07:06.092
everything that
we've done before this,

07:06.159 --> 07:07.460
we can do it;
we can do it again.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.795
We can adapt on our feet.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.096
We're a good team
that knows what to do.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.465
- Yeah.
- And it's just...

07:17.270 --> 07:19.772
- Hey, can I talk
to everyone for a sec?

07:27.180 --> 07:30.983
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

07:31.083 --> 07:34.420
I basically did the dumbest
thing of my entire life.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.956
I messed up.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.758
Both of our coaches got fired,

07:38.825 --> 07:41.194
and now we're in a tournament
with no leader,

07:41.294 --> 07:42.595
and it's probably gonna cost us

07:42.662 --> 07:43.930
everything we've worked
so hard for.

07:43.996 --> 07:47.166
And I can't fix that, but...

07:47.266 --> 07:49.502
I hope you can forgive me.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.372
It's not your fault.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.808
No, it really is,

07:55.875 --> 07:57.677
unless someone else
was also sleeping with him,

07:57.777 --> 07:59.545
which I guess is possible.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.114
- Dalton is clearly
the problem here.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.983
He's older,
and he was your coach.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.152
That's just
fucking nasty and wrong.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.620
- Yeah.
- And let's be real.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.655
That man was low-key very dumb.

08:09.722 --> 08:10.790
- Yes.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.225
And he always had a pee spot

08:12.325 --> 08:13.860
on his pants
after he went to the bathroom.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.396
- It's so true.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.031
- Now, can we
go practice, please?

08:19.131 --> 08:21.167
all: Yes.

08:38.885 --> 08:39.752
Fuck it.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.857
- I know,
he's, like, 5'6".

08:46.826 --> 08:49.095
So I'm borrowing this suit,
and it's like--

08:49.195 --> 08:50.897
I'm like this.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.832
And neither of us
got the job.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.767
- Neither of you got the job?

08:54.867 --> 08:56.769
- Neither of us got the job,
after all that.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.939
No, it gets--he's about to flex
and bust out of the suit.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.440
He's like...

09:01.541 --> 09:03.175
- I mean yeah, you're, like,
Hulking out of the suit.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.177
<i>- Yeah, I don't know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

09:05.244 --> 09:06.879
I can't let Ryan
get away with all this,

09:06.946 --> 09:08.948
but I don't think I want
to Title IX his ass either.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.416
Why not? He deserves

09:10.516 --> 09:12.118
absolutely everything
that's coming for him.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.520
- Yeah, but what if
I don't want to deal with this?

09:14.587 --> 09:16.956
I'll get examined
and picked apart too.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.291
Yeah, she's right.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.458
Reporting it might not
be a good idea.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.793
- Thank you.
- Really?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.628
- Seriously?
- Hey, I don't like it.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.964
All right, I'm just saying,
Bela has a point.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.800
Sometimes bad shit happens
to women who report stuff.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.402
- Nuh-uh, don't listen to her.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.938
Okay, this guy sneak attacked
you with his dick.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.139
He needs to pay.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.473
I say you Title IX
his bitch ass.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.576
- Hold on,
maybe as a first step,

09:36.642 --> 09:38.244
you could go
to another upperclassman

09:38.311 --> 09:40.313
at "The Catullan"
and ask them what they think.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.317
- Literally all those options
sound so stressful.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.118
- Well, do you wanna
squeeze my stress ball?

09:46.218 --> 09:48.487
I've been squeezing it a lot,
so it's pretty flat.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.002
Hey, it's late.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.172
- Yeah, it's just,
there's so much shit going down

10:06.272 --> 10:08.574
with my roommates and, um,

10:08.641 --> 10:10.109
I really wanted to see you.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.744
How's Bela holding up?

10:11.811 --> 10:14.513
- She ate a bunch of
gummy worms before breakfast.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.015
Couldn't tell you
if that's good or bad,

10:16.115 --> 10:17.683
but I think she'll be okay.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.818
What's in the bag?

10:18.918 --> 10:20.186
Is it a gift to make up

10:20.286 --> 10:21.687
for freezing me out
of your social life?

10:21.787 --> 10:23.089
- Basically.
- Mm.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.024
Yes, I got you one of those

10:25.124 --> 10:27.493
grocery store cakes
you so weirdly love.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.528
- Yeah, they taste better
than fancy ones.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.031
- That's just not true,
but in time, we can fix you.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.367
I--I asked them to write,

10:34.467 --> 10:36.369
"Sorry I was such a bitch,"
with icing,

10:36.469 --> 10:37.803
but apparently,
the Stop and Shop

10:37.870 --> 10:39.372
has a "no swear words" policy.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.173
Try Price Chopper next time.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.009
Anything goes at that place.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.377
I will.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.316
Should we just, like,
get out of town tomorrow?

10:50.383 --> 10:52.284
Go somewhere
we can be ourselves?

10:52.351 --> 10:55.054
Maybe even overnight?

10:55.154 --> 10:57.890
Yeah, sounds nice.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.225
How about this?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.693
I'll drive us
and pick out the place.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.029
And you pay for gas, meals,

11:03.129 --> 11:04.730
and lodging because I'm poor.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.332
- Done.
- Perfect.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.901
Okay, now let me
see this grocery cake.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.671
Oh, yeah, there it is.

11:11.737 --> 11:12.905
Is that a Minion?

11:13.005 --> 11:14.907
Oh, no, wait,
it's a school bus.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.009
No, it's a Minion.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.017
Good luck at your away game.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.319
- You totally got this.
- Thanks.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.021
Hey, good luck on your midterm.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.756
Thanks, I'll need it.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.303
- May I use
the restroom, please?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.738
The test just started.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.306
I have a UTI,

12:20.406 --> 12:22.575
and it's really
flaring up right now.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.543
One symptom
is frequent urination,

12:24.610 --> 12:26.579
- and it's very painful.
- Okay.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.081
Look, in the future,
you can just say medical issue.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.181
- Thank you both so much
for meeting with me.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.983
- Yeah, whatever this is,
can we make it fast?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.485
I got tickets to a Kurosawa
marathon at the film society.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.454
Sure, so...

13:10.356 --> 13:12.792
Ryan kind of assaulted me.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.627
Oh, my God, are you serious?

13:14.693 --> 13:18.697
- Yeah, a couple of weeks ago,
he got me alone,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.833
put a porn on,
and watched it in front of me,

13:20.933 --> 13:23.035
which was weird,
and I ignored it.

13:23.135 --> 13:28.340
But then, um, on the day
of the final submissions, he...

13:28.440 --> 13:30.209
- did something worse.
- Okay.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.144
- Wait, should we be hearing
this, like, alone right now?

13:32.211 --> 13:34.280
Should--should someone be here
with us or--

13:34.346 --> 13:35.447
What did he do?

13:36.215 --> 13:38.384
- He shoved his hard dick
against my back.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.819
Whoa. Okay, his hard dick?

13:39.885 --> 13:41.554
- What the fuck?
- Eric, chill.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.955
- No, I mean,
that's a serious allegation.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.356
- I agree,
and that's why you should

13:44.456 --> 13:45.791
chill the fuck out
and let Bela talk.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.561
I'm so sorry
that this happened.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.862
Are you okay?

13:49.962 --> 13:51.297
- Yeah, I talked
to the Title IX office,

13:51.363 --> 13:52.898
but I'm not sure
if I want to do that.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.300
- Title IX?
You're already going there?

13:54.366 --> 13:55.801
- Eric, please.
- No, I don't want

13:55.868 --> 13:57.469
to be involved in this,
and quite frankly,

13:57.536 --> 13:59.004
I'm not even sure there's
a "this" to be involved in.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.506
It sounds like
a misunderstanding.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.174
Maybe Bela should
just talk to Ryan about it.

14:02.241 --> 14:05.044
- He did it to Carla too.
He showed her his dick.

14:05.144 --> 14:07.079
- What?
- That's why she quit.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.415
- Look, I've known Ryan
for years.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.183
He's--he's not
the kind of person

14:11.250 --> 14:12.718
who's going around shoving
his hard dick against people.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.587
I'm sorry, I--I just--

14:14.687 --> 14:16.255
I don't believe this.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.756
- You know we're supposed to,
like, believe women, right?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.592
- Yeah, and I usually
do believe them.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.260
I'm, like, constantly believing
women, but this is different.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.729
And, you know, next time,
maybe write us an email.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.264
Give us a little warning
before you come in here

14:25.364 --> 14:26.699
and drop a giant bomb on us.

14:26.765 --> 14:28.033
Jesus.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.673
Hey, you did the right thing.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.609
Okay.

14:37.676 --> 14:38.711
Thanks.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.047
<i>Okay, you have to give me</i>

14:42.114 --> 14:43.415
<i>one clue</i>
<i>about where we're going.</i>

14:43.515 --> 14:44.750
I get very stressed
when I don't know

14:44.850 --> 14:46.118
what occasion to dress for.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.187
- Really? 'Cause I feel like
this outfit

14:48.254 --> 14:50.189
could work for lots
of different things.

14:50.256 --> 14:53.559
- Well, sure, but not if we're
going to, like, a Four Seasons.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.962
Alicia, if we are going
to a Four Seasons,

14:57.062 --> 14:58.464
I do need to change.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.901
- I promise, we are not
going to a Four Seasons.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.070
- I got us a cute
bed-and-breakfast

15:05.137 --> 15:06.472
run by a local beekeeper.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.940
It's really quaint,

15:08.040 --> 15:09.475
and they have an option
to sleep in a barn.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.044
- Oh, my God,
that sounds so cool.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.113
What is
their cancellation policy?

15:14.213 --> 15:15.748
- Are you looking up
hotels already?

15:15.814 --> 15:17.049
I am.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.493
Okay, this is more like it.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.961
I mean, it's not a B&B,

15:29.061 --> 15:31.263
but, uh, there's a TV
so we can watch Bravo.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.399
I see a bed.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.268
- That's all I care about.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.307
What about all those
rural Vermont hot spots

15:41.407 --> 15:42.608
you wanted to show me?

15:42.675 --> 15:44.009
- I'm suddenly
less interested in them.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.255
Get on your back.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.141
- Oh, I fucking love your body.
- Good.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.977
Keep doing that.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.715
Did you seriously already
order room service?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.184
- No, I asked them
to send up extra towels.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.453
And leave them outside!

16:29.888 --> 16:32.358
Oh, fuck.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.306
Maddie, I'm open.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.891
- Hey, it's all right.
- I know.

17:05.991 --> 17:08.327
I just really wanted
to win that one.

17:08.394 --> 17:09.862
Look, this is the best season

17:09.928 --> 17:11.430
the team has had
in, like, ten years,

17:11.530 --> 17:13.098
and it's mainly because of you.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.400
And me.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.901
But mainly you.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.669
Next year,
we'll go all the way.

17:19.171 --> 17:20.773
- Okay.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.370
Wait, what?

18:00.379 --> 18:01.480
What the fuck?

18:08.720 --> 18:10.155
Hello.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.825
- I feel like this robe
might be my new everyday look.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.428
- I feel like a hot drug lord.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.665
Okay, where should we go first?

18:19.765 --> 18:22.634
Hmm? Yelp is suggesting
a lot of sad suburban bars

18:22.734 --> 18:25.904
and an ax-throwing brewery.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.340
Smart combo.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.945
Whoa, Alicia, you posted that?
My purse is in the background.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.848
Um, yes in soft focus.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.517
The focal point is obviously me
looking amazing in the robe.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.586
- Hey, can--can you please
take it down?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.523
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.791
It--it's my Saint Laurent.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.292
People are
gonna recognize it

18:47.359 --> 18:48.694
and--and know that we are
in a hotel room together.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.029
- Leighton,
you're being ridiculous.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.531
You can barely see it.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.433
No one's gonna zoom in
and know it's your bag.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.201
- Oh, because you hang out
with so many people

18:56.301 --> 18:57.503
who have bags like that?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.539
Okay, Bela just liked it.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.808
I'm serious, take it down.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.010
Fine.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.212
I'll delete it.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.680
Thank you.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.456
Bro, I swear to God,

19:17.523 --> 19:19.558
Stan Lee has a cameo
in "Captain Marvel."

19:19.658 --> 19:22.161
- How's he going
to be in a movie in 2019

19:22.227 --> 19:23.695
when he died in 2018?

19:23.795 --> 19:25.731
- Okay, obviously,
you don't understand

19:25.831 --> 19:28.233
- how movies are made.
- Uh, Canaan?

19:29.635 --> 19:32.171
- Oh, excuse me, miss.
Are you lost?

19:32.237 --> 19:33.672
You don't live at the KJ House.

19:33.739 --> 19:37.509
This is a dorm for people
who answer text messages.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.244
Hey, um,

19:39.344 --> 19:40.979
sorry I've been
dodging your texts.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.549
I was going through
some personal stuff,

19:43.649 --> 19:45.817
but I think it's over.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.986
All right.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.254
Are you mad at me?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.756
Am I mad at you?

19:50.856 --> 19:54.026
No, you just gave me
a super vague,

19:54.092 --> 19:57.162
cryptic explanation
for why you ghosted me.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.898
So I'd say we're all good now.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.935
- Yeah, Whitney, you can't
just come crawling back

20:03.035 --> 20:04.903
thinking he been
sitting around waiting for you.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.005
- Canaan got options.
- That's right.

20:07.072 --> 20:09.374
- A lot of the options
are real ugly,

20:09.441 --> 20:10.742
but they are options.

20:10.842 --> 20:14.012
Okay, well, I am sorry,

20:14.079 --> 20:16.882
- and I could've texted.
- It's good.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.351
By the way,
I heard about your game.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.920
Sorry you lost, but honestly,

20:22.020 --> 20:23.422
I'm kind of happy
soccer's done.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.424
Now you have more time
to hang out with me.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.960
- Mm, you've been
looking me up?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.229
- No, I--I read it on ESPN.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.097
I did have to scroll down
really far, though.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.533
They do not put
women's sports up at the top.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.301
- No, they don't.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.536
Come on.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.142
- So what does this town
have in the way of dinner?

20:44.243 --> 20:47.312
I'm thinking chicken tenders
from a chain restaurant?

20:47.412 --> 20:49.281
I think we need to end this.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.084
What?

20:53.051 --> 20:55.454
- I can't keep dating someone
this closeted.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.623
I can't keep sneaking around.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.058
I feel like you're bringing me
back in the closet with you.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.426
I've already been through this.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.128
I can't go backward.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.664
Okay, but what about me?

21:05.764 --> 21:06.999
I'm just--I'm not ready.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.167
- Exactly, and you might
never feel ready.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.936
So where does that leave me?

21:11.503 --> 21:13.005
Believe me, I get it.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.140
It was really hard coming out
to both my grandmas

21:15.240 --> 21:17.943
on Easter Sunday, but I did it.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.012
And it made me feel
so much better.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.847
- No, I just don't like
the idea of coming out.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.649
I don't feel the need
to announce to the world

21:23.749 --> 21:25.350
what type of people
that I sleep with

21:25.450 --> 21:26.918
and let that detail define me.

21:26.985 --> 21:29.021
- But it doesn't
have to define you.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.522
It totally does.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.257
If you Google a gay person,

21:32.324 --> 21:33.692
the first word
that auto-populates

21:33.792 --> 21:35.093
after their name is "gay."

21:35.160 --> 21:36.762
It becomes their new
main characteristic,

21:36.828 --> 21:38.830
and I don't need that;
I like who I am.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.466
I don't want to come out
and become all political

21:41.533 --> 21:43.769
and have it affect
how I act and speak

21:43.835 --> 21:46.872
and dress and what things I do.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.874
Um...

21:48.974 --> 21:52.144
you're describing me.

21:52.210 --> 21:56.448
The thing you so desperately
don't want to be is me.

21:59.785 --> 22:03.555
Look, I really care about you.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.724
I like--

22:08.994 --> 22:10.395
But if you can't
be out with me,

22:10.495 --> 22:12.331
I can't be with you.

22:17.969 --> 22:19.971
Then I guess we're done.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.517
- So now Eric
officially hates me.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.885
I shouldn't
have said anything.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.153
I think it's good you did.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.189
Staying silent only leads
to regret.

22:37.255 --> 22:38.924
- And you might not
be there yet,

22:39.024 --> 22:40.258
but let me know
when you're ready

22:40.359 --> 22:41.560
to get revenge
on that sick freak.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.428
I will aid and abet you
all day.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.100
Hey, Bela.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.768
Hi.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.937
Guys, this is Eric,
the editor of "The Catullan."

22:52.037 --> 22:53.505
- Oh, nuh-uh.
Not today, sicko.

22:53.572 --> 22:54.940
You get your rape-y dick
out of here

22:55.040 --> 22:56.541
- before I cut it off.
- Yeah, guess what.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.009
It's your turn to get
assaulted, shit bird.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.711
- No, guys, this is Eric,
the other editor.

22:59.778 --> 23:02.180
- Ryan's the handsome one.
- Hey, what the fuck?

23:02.247 --> 23:04.282
- Sorry, it's been a long day.
- Yeah, whatever.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.919
Can we just talk for a sec,
like, alone?

23:10.389 --> 23:11.757
Sure.

23:15.627 --> 23:17.295
- Can I get a glass of water
or something?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.064
- No.
- Oh.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.534
I wrote this down
so I wouldn't get it wrong.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.306
My initial reaction
earlier today sucked.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.076
As an editor and as
a sometimes very awkward

23:31.143 --> 23:33.812
and thoughtless person,
I'm sorry.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.480
I handled myself poorly.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.550
I believe you, and I will
do something about it.

23:40.218 --> 23:41.586
Wow.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.455
Thank you, Eric.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.091
- Yeah, okay, well,
I'm gonna get out of here.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.493
Smells like a candle store
in a mall.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.143
Leighton.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.014
Hey, what's up?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.816
Nothing, just...

24:10.916 --> 24:14.986
going on a brisk walk for
no particular reason at all.

24:15.086 --> 24:17.422
Same, same.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.658
- Why do you
have luggage with you?

24:19.758 --> 24:21.827
Oh, I had, uh,

24:21.927 --> 24:24.863
planned a trip
but then decided not to go.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.331
Mm. Are you okay?

24:26.431 --> 24:28.834
Yeah. Are you okay?

24:28.934 --> 24:31.136
Yeah, yeah.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.842
- Hey--hey,
did Nico talk to you today?

24:36.942 --> 24:39.144
No, no, he did not.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.278
Seriously?

24:40.345 --> 24:41.680
You haven't heard
from him at all?

24:44.316 --> 24:45.717
Okay.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.319
Are you headed home?

24:47.385 --> 24:50.055
- No, I'm headed
somewhere else first.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.458
Okay.

24:57.395 --> 24:58.663
Hey, how's it going?

24:58.730 --> 25:01.466
- Nico was cheating on you.
A lot.

26:24.215 --> 26:25.283
<i>Go to bed.</i>
