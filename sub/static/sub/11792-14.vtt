WEBVTT

00:00.769 --> 00:02.005
Previously on nip tuck...

00:02.074 --> 00:03.483
This is really bad.

00:03.551 --> 00:04.921
How come I don't feel guilty?

00:04.988 --> 00:07.397
We need to stop doing this.

00:07.464 --> 00:08.400
You're not goin' back to him,

00:08.467 --> 00:09.000
are you?

00:09.068 --> 00:10.070
He's my husband, Sean.

00:10.138 --> 00:11.404
You deserve better.

00:11.472 --> 00:14.140
You'll never make me happy.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.710
I can never love you enough.

00:15.778 --> 00:16.779
We've hit a rough patch. You

00:16.847 --> 00:18.418
don't break up because of it.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.789
He's done with me now.

00:19.857 --> 00:21.193
Good. He's doin' you a favor,

00:21.260 --> 00:24.637
Kimber. It's a gift.

00:24.704 --> 00:26.240
Kimber fell off her boat

00:26.308 --> 00:29.172
last night. She's missing.

00:34.119 --> 00:36.022
Oh,my goodness these are

00:36.090 --> 00:38.695
so good. Here. I'll go get you

00:38.763 --> 00:40.398
some food, ok?

00:40.468 --> 00:41.936
Weather report says it should

00:42.004 --> 00:43.339
be clear through the weekend.

00:43.407 --> 00:44.241
That'll help.

00:44.309 --> 00:45.845
It's been 2 days, Sean.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.181
If the coast guard's not

00:47.249 --> 00:52.058
givin' up, then we can't either.

00:52.126 --> 00:53.929
You want some noodles?

00:53.997 --> 00:54.964
Jesus, what are you doing,

00:55.032 --> 00:56.834
Matt, feeding the kid Thai food?

00:56.902 --> 00:57.836
It's too spicy. What's your

00:57.903 --> 00:58.436
problem?

00:58.505 --> 01:00.239
Take it easy. Wanna get

01:00.307 --> 01:01.274
pissed at someone, be mad

01:01.342 --> 01:01.909
at hamoui.

01:01.977 --> 01:02.711
If the police didn't charge

01:02.779 --> 01:03.479
him with anything, what the hell

01:03.547 --> 01:04.748
am I gonna do?

01:04.816 --> 01:08.422
Ar

01:08.491 --> 01:11.761
hello. Hi, Brandie. No, you're

01:11.829 --> 01:14.029
at the right place. Ok. See you

01:14.097 --> 01:16.729
in a minute. It's Kimber's mom.

01:16.797 --> 01:17.363
Have you really

01:17.431 --> 01:18.764
never met her?

01:18.832 --> 01:19.898
Kimber kicked her out of her

01:19.966 --> 01:21.133
life a long time ago, didn't

01:21.201 --> 01:22.334
invite her to the wedding, so...

01:22.402 --> 01:23.769
What happened between them?

01:24.470 --> 01:25.270
"Unresolved issues"

01:25.338 --> 01:27.405
is what I heard.

01:32.713 --> 01:35.412
Christian.

01:35.479 --> 01:36.545
You made it.

01:36.613 --> 01:37.579
Heh. Hi.

01:37.647 --> 01:39.347
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:39.415 --> 01:42.942
Nice to meet you, too. Hi.

01:43.010 --> 01:45.209
Hey, didn't you, uh, say you

01:45.277 --> 01:46.010
were bringing someone

01:46.078 --> 01:46.544
with you or...

01:46.612 --> 01:48.246
Oh, les is coming tomorrow.

01:48.314 --> 01:50.449
I... he's got business, so... heh.

01:50.517 --> 01:51.083
I'm here.

01:51.151 --> 01:52.017
Ok. Come in.

01:52.085 --> 01:53.152
Wow, this is right

01:53.220 --> 01:53.953
on the water.

01:54.021 --> 01:55.188
Brandie, I'm Sean.

01:55.255 --> 01:55.922
Hello, Sean.

01:55.990 --> 01:56.756
Hi. I'm a friend of

01:56.824 --> 01:58.458
Christian's and your daughter.

01:58.526 --> 01:59.626
Hi.

01:59.694 --> 02:01.328
Hey. I'm, uh... I'm Matt.

02:01.396 --> 02:03.197
You're Matt. Oh, so this

02:03.264 --> 02:04.198
must be Jenna.

02:04.266 --> 02:07.669
Yeah.

02:07.737 --> 02:10.472
Wow. This is a lot to take

02:10.539 --> 02:13.075
in... son-in-law, a granddaughter,

02:13.143 --> 02:16.045
an ex-son-in-law.

02:16.113 --> 02:17.013
I wish it could be under

02:17.080 --> 02:21.518
different circumstances.

02:21.585 --> 02:23.587
Well, the important part is

02:23.654 --> 02:24.988
we're all here now.

02:25.723 --> 02:26.790
That's right.

02:26.858 --> 02:27.858
Hey, little one, you wanna

02:27.926 --> 02:29.960
go back and finish coloring? Ok.

02:30.028 --> 02:30.794
Ok.

02:30.862 --> 02:31.929
I was just thinking on the

02:31.997 --> 02:33.764
way here that when Kimmy was

02:33.832 --> 02:35.132
a little girl, I taught her

02:35.200 --> 02:36.300
how to swim in the lake that

02:36.368 --> 02:37.936
was near our house, and she

02:38.003 --> 02:39.538
just loved the water so much,

02:39.605 --> 02:41.306
you know? She was such a good

02:41.374 --> 02:44.843
swimmer. Just... I just hope that

02:44.911 --> 02:46.278
everything is gonna be

02:46.346 --> 02:48.146
all right. And she's tough.

02:48.214 --> 02:51.483
Yeah, she is.

02:51.551 --> 02:53.185
That was the coast guard.

02:53.253 --> 02:55.154
They're, um, callin' off

02:55.221 --> 02:56.955
the search.

Jenna, sweetheart,

04:00.108 --> 04:01.208
it's time to go.

04:01.276 --> 04:05.211
Go? Don't you think it's a

04:05.279 --> 04:07.447
little soon to be uprooting her?

04:07.514 --> 04:08.981
Uprooting her? I'm... 

04:09.049 --> 04:10.449
I'm her father.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.917
Yeah, but come on. Please,

04:11.985 --> 04:12.851
act like an adult for once

04:12.919 --> 04:14.819
in your life. What, you gonna

04:14.887 --> 04:16.120
take her to your shithole?

04:16.188 --> 04:17.488
Who's gonna take care of her

04:17.555 --> 04:19.822
when you're lookin' for a job?

04:19.891 --> 04:21.658
Well, my shithole is a sunny

04:21.726 --> 04:23.093
studio is a great old deco

04:23.160 --> 04:24.093
building, and I'm actually

04:24.161 --> 04:26.595
working right now. Yes, it's as

04:26.663 --> 04:27.863
a barista at the coffee mill

04:27.931 --> 04:30.199
on hyperion, but it's a job. And

04:30.266 --> 04:32.033
fyi., I'm dating the manager.

04:32.101 --> 04:33.535
Her name's Ramona. She comes

04:33.602 --> 04:35.403
from a huge family, and they all

04:35.471 --> 04:38.005
absolutely love my daughter.

04:38.073 --> 04:39.140
So when are we gonna meet

04:39.207 --> 04:42.409
this Ramona, then?

04:46.813 --> 04:49.413
Jenna, honey, Ramona's waiting.

04:49.481 --> 04:50.914
She made us some meatball soup.

04:50.982 --> 04:53.850
You wanna go? Ok.

04:53.918 --> 04:54.817
Come on and give me a big,

04:54.885 --> 05:00.155
big, big one. Ohh.

05:00.222 --> 05:03.058
And a kiss. I love you.

05:03.125 --> 05:05.059
I love you, too.

05:05.127 --> 05:07.161
Ohh. You be a good girl, ok?

05:07.228 --> 05:08.528
I will.

05:08.596 --> 05:09.496
Ok.

05:09.563 --> 05:10.930
I will see you soon.

05:10.998 --> 05:12.398
See you soon.

05:12.467 --> 05:17.040
Ohh. Let's go.

05:18.409 --> 05:19.976
Ok.

05:32.087 --> 05:33.587
Brandie?

05:33.655 --> 05:36.289
Sorry. Um, should I... 

05:36.357 --> 05:37.057
no, no, no. It's not

05:37.124 --> 05:38.324
a problem. I was just checkin'

05:38.392 --> 05:41.290
if you're ok.

05:41.358 --> 05:47.197
I'm ok. Heh. I just... I just

05:47.265 --> 05:48.934
wish that somehow we could have

05:49.001 --> 05:53.804
worked out our differences.

05:53.872 --> 05:57.140
She was always so mad at me. I

05:57.141 --> 05:58.675
mean, we were more like sisters

05:58.742 --> 06:00.409
in a way, because I had her when

06:00.477 --> 06:04.078
I was so young. I just didn't... 

06:04.146 --> 06:07.446
I didn't have a clue. And I

06:07.514 --> 06:09.148
tried to reach out to her,

06:09.216 --> 06:11.350
but she didn't want me to be

06:11.417 --> 06:16.821
a part of her big, fancy life.

06:16.888 --> 06:19.723
Yeah, you can't let the guilt

06:19.791 --> 06:23.326
take over. I know it's hard,

06:23.393 --> 06:28.830
t snthis i't about us.

06:28.898 --> 06:30.932
It's about Kimber. We need

06:31.000 --> 06:36.569
to celebrate her and her life.

06:36.637 --> 06:41.606
Yeah. You're right.

06:48.648 --> 06:49.948
Tell me what you don't like

06:50.016 --> 06:51.283
about yourself, mrs...

06:51.350 --> 06:54.051
Carlton, Sheila Carlton.

06:54.119 --> 06:55.252
Course, I call her Shu-Shu,

06:55.320 --> 06:56.286
but that's because I've been

06:56.354 --> 06:57.787
calling her Shu-Shu since we met

06:57.855 --> 06:59.355
in middle school, or was it

06:59.422 --> 07:00.189
in high school? I don't even

07:00.256 --> 07:01.489
remember. It seems like

07:01.557 --> 07:02.991
the years have flown by, and I

07:03.059 --> 07:06.193
keep calling her Shu-Shu.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.793
Well, it says here that

07:07.861 --> 07:09.795
the injuries to your face

07:09.863 --> 07:10.596
were caused by... 

07:10.663 --> 07:12.364
me. It was because of me.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.465
That's why she's here, because I

07:14.533 --> 07:15.833
almost killed her.

07:15.901 --> 07:16.968
It wasn't your fault, Jane.

07:17.036 --> 07:20.573
Stop blaming yourself. It was

07:20.640 --> 07:22.508
Wayne. He's the one who did this

07:22.575 --> 07:25.210
to me. He's an animal.

07:33.382 --> 07:35.015
Uh, I'm sorry. Wayne is

07:35.083 --> 07:36.049
your husband?

07:36.117 --> 07:38.251
Monkey.

07:38.319 --> 07:41.453
Chimpanzee. He weighed

07:41.521 --> 07:44.022
over 200 pounds. He had

07:44.090 --> 07:47.625
a big appetite.

07:47.693 --> 07:49.193
Well, I'm gonna have to do

07:49.261 --> 07:51.228
a complete workup and talk

07:51.296 --> 07:52.529
to the surgeons who treated you

07:52.597 --> 07:54.865
after the attack, but I would

07:54.932 --> 07:55.865
recommend that you do

07:55.933 --> 07:57.166
the reconstructive surgeries

07:57.234 --> 07:59.568
in stages. Your body's already

07:59.636 --> 08:00.969
been through enough trauma.

08:01.037 --> 08:03.973
And it's my fault. Can you

08:04.040 --> 08:05.641
imagine being the one to cause

08:05.709 --> 08:09.111
your oldest friend such agony?

08:09.179 --> 08:10.813
Reminds me of that awful tragedy

08:10.881 --> 08:12.114
with Travis in Connecticut

08:12.182 --> 08:13.215
a few years back.

08:13.283 --> 08:14.416
Jane, please.

08:14.484 --> 08:15.651
I shouldn't have let him out

08:15.719 --> 08:17.753
of his cage. He seemed unsettled

08:17.821 --> 08:19.221
that morning, and I... I should

08:19.289 --> 08:19.855
have just... 

08:19.923 --> 08:21.891
you saved my life, Jane.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.226
Now stop it.

08:24.294 --> 08:26.929
How did you?

08:30.700 --> 08:35.804
I hit him with a frying pan.

08:35.871 --> 08:37.539
And when he wouldn't release

08:37.607 --> 08:40.976
her, I stabbed him repeatedly

08:41.044 --> 08:43.010
with a kitchen knife.

08:48.585 --> 08:50.552
I don't know how you can ever

08:50.620 --> 08:52.254
forgive me.

09:00.096 --> 09:01.930
Why don't I have a nurse

09:01.997 --> 09:04.065
escort you to the exam room.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.366
You can change, and we can do

09:05.434 --> 09:06.601
a thorough exam.

09:06.669 --> 09:07.569
I want you to make her

09:07.636 --> 09:08.737
as beautiful as she was. I don't

09:08.804 --> 09:10.071
care what it costs.

09:10.139 --> 09:10.839
Jane, it's never

09:10.906 --> 09:11.272
going to be... 

09:11.340 --> 09:14.742
he owes you this. Wayne did

09:14.810 --> 09:16.677
some work in movies, uh,

09:16.745 --> 09:19.447
television shows. He had such

09:19.514 --> 09:20.614
star appeal. He was such

09:20.682 --> 09:22.216
a little performer.

09:26.854 --> 09:28.321
I never spent a dime of his

09:28.389 --> 09:29.422
money. I was saving it for his

09:29.490 --> 09:31.491
old age. But I'm spending it

09:31.559 --> 09:34.794
now, every cent. And everything

09:34.862 --> 09:39.868
I have as well, if I have to.

09:43.005 --> 09:44.539
Where is she?

09:44.607 --> 09:46.107
Um, she...

09:46.175 --> 09:47.242
Les.

09:47.310 --> 09:50.011
Come here, baby. It's ok.

09:50.079 --> 09:51.646
I'm here now.

09:51.714 --> 09:54.382
I can't believe it's true.

09:54.450 --> 09:56.251
When'd you hear for sure?

09:56.318 --> 09:57.385
Last night.

09:57.453 --> 09:58.419
Is that why you didn't

09:58.487 --> 09:59.687
pick me up at the airport?

09:59.755 --> 10:00.455
'Cause that's what we

10:00.522 --> 10:01.622
originally planned.

10:01.690 --> 10:03.957
Les.

10:04.025 --> 10:05.225
I'm, uh, Christian Troy,

10:05.293 --> 10:06.560
Kimber's husband.

10:06.628 --> 10:07.761
The... the plastic surgeon.

10:07.829 --> 10:08.362
Yes.

10:08.429 --> 10:09.930
Mmm. My deepest condolences.

10:09.998 --> 10:11.065
Thank you.

10:11.132 --> 10:14.301
Please, uh, forgive me. Was

10:14.369 --> 10:16.503
that your Maserati out there?

10:16.571 --> 10:17.704
Yeah.

10:17.772 --> 10:19.740
Wow. For somebody so

10:19.807 --> 10:20.907
concerned about appearances,

10:20.975 --> 10:23.042
to drive a foreign car. Pfft.

10:23.110 --> 10:24.043
Excuse me?

10:24.111 --> 10:24.911
American economy needs

10:24.979 --> 10:25.812
our support.

10:25.879 --> 10:26.479
Les, this... 

10:26.547 --> 10:27.547
I own the largest domestic

10:27.615 --> 10:28.948
dealership in Wisconsin. All

10:29.016 --> 10:29.882
makes. Great deals. You'd be

10:29.950 --> 10:30.683
surprised what your money can

10:30.750 --> 10:33.118
buy nowadays. We ship anywhere.

10:33.186 --> 10:34.453
You tryin' to sell me a car?

10:34.520 --> 10:35.520
Heh heh heh. I don't sell

10:35.588 --> 10:38.656
cars. I make people happy.

10:38.724 --> 10:40.657
Ready to get back to the hotel?

10:40.725 --> 10:42.058
Christian invited us to stay

10:42.126 --> 10:43.126
here. We were talking about

10:43.194 --> 10:44.061
the memorial service... 

10:44.128 --> 10:45.829
I... I already booked the room

10:45.896 --> 10:47.831
for a week, remember, on points.

10:47.898 --> 10:48.331
Yeah.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.300
Gotta try that jacuzzi, huh?

10:50.367 --> 10:51.167
You don't... you don't wanna see

10:51.235 --> 10:52.001
her before she puts her face on

10:52.069 --> 10:53.836
in the morning anyway. Listen,

10:53.904 --> 10:54.937
i-is there a bathroom around

10:55.005 --> 10:55.938
here? I had a couple beers on

10:56.006 --> 10:57.139
the plane, and my bladder's...

10:57.207 --> 11:02.211
Just back there.

11:02.279 --> 11:03.746
Charming. So how long you guys

11:03.813 --> 11:04.847
been together?

11:04.915 --> 11:07.549
6 years. We break up. We get

11:07.617 --> 11:08.684
back together. We break up

11:08.752 --> 11:11.186
again. He can be a lot

11:11.254 --> 11:13.289
to handle, but I love him.

11:13.356 --> 11:16.125
We have a connection.

11:16.192 --> 11:18.560
Well, Kimber and i, we sure

11:18.628 --> 11:20.128
had our fair share of ups and

11:20.196 --> 11:23.130
downs, you know. I understand

11:23.198 --> 11:23.864
exactly what you're

11:23.932 --> 11:25.232
talking about.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.366
I guess it runs

11:26.434 --> 11:30.236
in the family, then.

11:30.304 --> 11:32.038
That is such great soap you

11:32.106 --> 11:33.539
got in there. I love it.

11:33.607 --> 11:35.107
You ready?

11:35.175 --> 11:36.008
Bye.

11:36.076 --> 11:38.544
We'll call you, ok? And don't

11:38.612 --> 11:39.345
forget to tell me where you got

11:39.413 --> 11:41.380
that soap. Love it.

11:47.219 --> 11:48.919
I am so sorry to hear that.

11:48.987 --> 11:49.953
Yeah, they were married about

11:50.021 --> 11:53.256
a year ago. Christian's taking

11:53.324 --> 11:54.524
it pretty hard.

11:54.592 --> 11:55.859
Well, well, please, give him

11:55.927 --> 11:58.295
my condolences. I just can't

11:58.362 --> 11:59.396
imagine what it would be like to

11:59.463 --> 12:03.265
lose Sarah. And suicide, jeez.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.633
That's difficult. I guess you

12:06.700 --> 12:08.566
just... you can't ever know what's

12:08.634 --> 12:10.068
goin' on in someone's head, even

12:10.136 --> 12:11.869
if you're married to 'em. Right?

12:11.937 --> 12:13.771
Yeah. I think, in a way,

12:13.839 --> 12:15.673
we all feel responsible.

12:15.740 --> 12:19.175
Aw, how can you not?

12:19.243 --> 12:22.178
You know, it's probably not the

12:22.246 --> 12:23.346
best time for you to be joining

12:23.413 --> 12:24.847
me in Africa, right?

12:24.914 --> 12:26.548
Probably not, Curtis.

12:26.616 --> 12:27.315
I'm sorry.

12:27.383 --> 12:29.117
Ah, I understand. Life gets

12:29.185 --> 12:30.251
in the way sometimes. You know,

12:30.319 --> 12:31.986
we all have responsibilities.

12:32.054 --> 12:32.987
And you can't leave Christian

12:33.055 --> 12:33.820
right now.

12:33.888 --> 12:39.055
No. You get back from this

12:39.123 --> 12:40.889
trip in, what, 3 weeks?

12:40.957 --> 12:41.623
Mm-hmm.

12:41.690 --> 12:42.590
Tell me about the next trip

12:42.657 --> 12:43.557
after that.

12:43.624 --> 12:44.357
Well, we'll be, uh,

12:44.425 --> 12:45.425
building a new hospital in Basra

12:45.492 --> 12:46.425
this spring.

12:46.492 --> 12:47.658
I'm in.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.026
What? I've heard that before,

12:49.094 --> 12:49.492
you know.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.693
No, no, no. It's firm this

12:50.761 --> 12:53.327
time. I am in. I'll get the ball

12:53.395 --> 12:55.559
rolling while you're in Africa.

12:55.627 --> 12:56.393
I won't let this be

12:56.459 --> 12:59.492
another Harvard.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.693
Cheers. I'll hold you

13:01.760 --> 13:02.360
to this one, buddy.

13:02.427 --> 13:03.993
Yeah.

13:10.992 --> 13:11.791
Your blood pressure's

13:11.859 --> 13:13.325
on the high side. Are you under

13:13.393 --> 13:14.959
a lot of stress lately?

13:15.027 --> 13:16.093
You could say that.

13:16.161 --> 13:17.594
You need to control it.

13:17.662 --> 13:19.831
Iraq isn't really relaxing.

13:19.899 --> 13:22.502
It's beautiful, yes, but their

13:22.570 --> 13:24.406
work there is really intense.

13:24.474 --> 13:25.742
I think it's gonna be very

13:25.810 --> 13:27.143
good for me, actually.

13:27.211 --> 13:28.477
It's exactly the kind of change

13:28.545 --> 13:29.979
I need in my life right now.

13:30.046 --> 13:31.047
Well, you couldn't have

13:31.115 --> 13:32.015
picked a better organization

13:32.083 --> 13:33.251
to work with, help change your

13:33.318 --> 13:34.486
life. The savior center is

13:34.553 --> 13:35.886
a great place to work.

13:35.954 --> 13:37.387
Curtis often says it saves us

13:37.455 --> 13:38.488
who work here at least as much

13:38.556 --> 13:39.756
as it saves our patients.

13:39.823 --> 13:40.790
It's so nice to meet you,

13:40.858 --> 13:42.258
Dr. McNamara. I've heard so many

13:42.326 --> 13:44.861
good things. Thank you, mallory.

13:44.928 --> 13:46.963
Dr. Kwinda. I'm sorry to say

13:47.031 --> 13:47.964
I haven't heard as much

13:48.032 --> 13:48.764
about you.

13:48.832 --> 13:49.798
That's just as well.

13:49.866 --> 13:51.266
We keep very busy around here.

13:51.334 --> 13:53.502
Eyes on the prize, so to speak.

13:53.569 --> 13:57.538
Hmm. Are you gonna be helping

13:57.606 --> 13:59.039
build the hospital in Basra?

13:59.107 --> 14:00.974
I'm afraid not. I'll be here

14:01.041 --> 14:02.242
in San Diego with nsolo,

14:02.309 --> 14:03.277
spending most of my time

14:03.345 --> 14:05.314
fundraising, unfortunately.

14:05.381 --> 14:07.316
Breathe deep, please.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.660
Heart rate's a little elevated.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.693
But we'll chalk that up

14:19.761 --> 14:21.895
to the excitement of a new job.

14:21.963 --> 14:23.497
We're all excited about it,

14:23.564 --> 14:25.299
frankly. You'll be our first

14:25.366 --> 14:26.967
reconstructive surgeon on staff,

14:27.035 --> 14:30.337
Dr. McNamara. Often our patients

14:30.404 --> 14:31.971
with deformities are ostracized

14:32.039 --> 14:33.039
from their villages and their

14:33.106 --> 14:35.440
communities. Your work will give

14:35.508 --> 14:39.978
them a chance at normalcy again.

14:40.046 --> 14:40.913
Would you like your prostate

14:40.981 --> 14:41.848
examined?

14:41.916 --> 14:43.051
Excuse me?

14:43.118 --> 14:45.022
You're 45. You need to check

14:45.089 --> 14:46.758
it every year. Better safe

14:46.825 --> 14:47.492
than sorry.

14:47.559 --> 14:48.326
Oh, no, no, no. Th... that's all

14:48.393 --> 14:49.460
right. We should at least be on

14:49.528 --> 14:50.830
a first-name basis before we... 

14:50.897 --> 14:52.499
I know yours, Sean.

14:52.566 --> 14:53.634
I'm surprised my husband didn't

14:53.702 --> 14:55.103
at least tell you mine.

14:55.171 --> 14:58.308
Oh, you're married to nsolo.

14:58.376 --> 15:01.079
No. Curtis is my husband.

15:01.146 --> 15:03.115
I'm Sarah.

15:03.183 --> 15:05.386
Oh.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.465
Am I disturbing you?

15:16.533 --> 15:18.667
Not at all. What are you

15:18.735 --> 15:20.802
doing in this neck of the woods?

15:20.870 --> 15:22.737
Well, les took me shopping

15:22.804 --> 15:24.505
at neiman Marcus, and he bought

15:24.573 --> 15:25.973
me a dress for the memorial,

15:26.040 --> 15:27.474
and I was wondering if you would

15:27.541 --> 15:29.142
take a look at it to see if you

15:29.209 --> 15:33.846
think Kimber would approve.

15:33.913 --> 15:35.380
Wow. That les, he's got an

15:35.448 --> 15:37.715
eye, doesn't he? Managed to pick

15:37.783 --> 15:38.782
the one dress in the world

15:38.850 --> 15:39.816
that would make you look like

15:39.884 --> 15:40.983
a whore.

15:41.051 --> 15:43.018
Ohh. That's not very nice.

15:43.085 --> 15:44.852
I'm sorry, but the guy's

15:44.920 --> 15:46.020
a tool, and I don't like the way

15:46.088 --> 15:46.821
he talks to you.

15:46.888 --> 15:49.657
Well, he takes care of me,

15:49.725 --> 15:51.125
you know, Christian.

15:51.193 --> 15:52.059
I thought women liked

15:52.127 --> 15:54.361
a little class. Kimber did.

15:54.429 --> 15:56.429
Well, I'm not Kimber.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.897
And Kimber was a star even

15:57.965 --> 15:59.866
before she became one. I'm just

15:59.933 --> 16:04.203
a midwestern nobody. What am

16:04.270 --> 16:05.537
I gonna do? I really wanted

16:05.605 --> 16:10.140
to make my baby girl proud.

16:10.208 --> 16:13.577
I have an idea. I have this

16:13.644 --> 16:15.678
laser machine that, uh, tightens

16:15.746 --> 16:17.279
the skin through soft-cell

16:17.347 --> 16:18.747
coagulation, and there's

16:18.815 --> 16:20.281
absolutely no healing time.

16:20.349 --> 16:22.083
It's like a high-tech facial.

16:22.150 --> 16:22.817
I'd like to talk

16:22.884 --> 16:23.684
to les first.

16:23.752 --> 16:24.952
Oh, no, no, no. Trust me.

16:25.020 --> 16:25.919
It's exactly what Kimmy

16:25.987 --> 16:28.221
would want you to do.

16:28.289 --> 16:29.155
Really?

16:29.223 --> 16:30.823
Yes.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.995
Is this gonna hurt?

16:38.063 --> 16:40.030
I told you. It's like, uh... 

16:40.098 --> 16:41.231
it's like getting a facial.

16:41.299 --> 16:43.299
I've never had a facial.

16:43.367 --> 16:46.969
Never could afford one. Heh.

16:47.036 --> 16:52.106
Sad, right? So Les always tells

16:52.174 --> 16:54.708
me that my skin is dry. Is this

16:54.776 --> 16:56.676
gonna help with that?

16:56.744 --> 16:57.710
It should.

16:57.778 --> 16:58.878
Yeah?

16:58.946 --> 17:01.680
Yeah. Ok, take a look

17:01.748 --> 17:04.482
over here for me. Great.

17:05.951 --> 17:10.720
Oh, I'm sorry. Just a sec.

17:10.788 --> 17:14.157
I, uh, forgot...

17:20.564 --> 17:22.064
I'm sorry I was never good

17:22.132 --> 17:24.266
enough for you either.

17:29.905 --> 17:34.408
Something wrong?

17:34.476 --> 17:39.345
Yeah. It's me.

17:39.413 --> 17:42.381
You don't need this, Brandie.

17:42.449 --> 17:48.086
Heh. You look beautiful just

17:48.153 --> 17:53.190
the way you are.

17:53.258 --> 17:57.527
Hmm. Wow. Les doesn't say

17:57.595 --> 18:00.062
that to me anymore. I haven't

18:00.130 --> 18:02.598
heard that in a long time.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.466
I missed it. Thank you.

18:28.253 --> 18:29.186
How do you get through

18:29.254 --> 18:30.220
something like that and not

18:30.288 --> 18:31.588
suffer posttraumatic stress

18:31.656 --> 18:32.756
for the rest of your life?

18:32.824 --> 18:33.723
What about her friend?

18:33.791 --> 18:34.958
Knowing that she was responsible

18:35.025 --> 18:35.925
for something like this.

18:35.993 --> 18:37.093
It's not like she trained it

18:37.161 --> 18:38.961
to be an attack monkey.

18:39.029 --> 18:40.496
It's what she's doing that

18:40.563 --> 18:43.031
counts, helping her friend deal

18:43.099 --> 18:44.199
with it, seeing her through all

18:44.266 --> 18:45.299
these surgeries.

18:45.367 --> 18:47.601
Maybe, but she's still gonna

18:47.669 --> 18:48.636
have to find a way to live with

18:48.703 --> 18:52.606
the guilt. I don't envy her.

18:52.674 --> 18:57.210
That's great. Yes. Oh,

18:57.278 --> 19:00.313
here he is. It's Curtis. Yes,

19:00.381 --> 19:01.782
of course I will. You, too,

19:01.849 --> 19:03.050
darling. I'll talk to you

19:03.117 --> 19:05.185
tomorrow. Curtis sends

19:05.253 --> 19:06.320
his regards.

19:06.387 --> 19:07.287
What are you doing here,

19:07.355 --> 19:08.055
dr. Kwinda?

19:08.122 --> 19:09.589
I gave a talk at usc med,

19:09.657 --> 19:10.991
and I thought that rather than

19:11.059 --> 19:12.225
face the horrible traffic back

19:12.293 --> 19:13.393
to San Diego, I'd see if you

19:13.461 --> 19:14.594
were free for dinner.

19:14.662 --> 19:18.065
Oh, uh... heh. Sure. I... I guess

19:18.132 --> 19:19.232
I'm available, yeah.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.701
Great. I'd love to hear your

19:20.768 --> 19:22.135
ideas on facial reconstruction

19:22.203 --> 19:22.936
for patients with

19:23.004 --> 19:25.005
neurofibromatosis.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.278
Hey.

19:31.346 --> 19:33.346
Hey.

19:33.414 --> 19:35.680
How... how'd you get in my house?

19:35.747 --> 19:36.914
Cleaning lady. Just came

19:36.982 --> 19:38.415
to grab Brandie's makeup bag.

19:38.483 --> 19:39.416
Guess, uh, she left it in your

19:39.483 --> 19:42.448
bathroom the other day.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.750
Is that what you're watchin'?

19:45.817 --> 19:48.449
Ok. Confession time. Uh,

19:48.517 --> 19:51.115
look, I only found out about

19:51.183 --> 19:52.182
Kimber's career from Brandie

19:52.250 --> 19:54.016
recently. Being somewhat

19:54.084 --> 19:55.284
of an aficionado, I couldn't

19:55.352 --> 19:56.619
help myself.

19:56.686 --> 19:58.153
So you went snoopin'

19:58.221 --> 19:59.288
through my shit.

19:59.355 --> 20:00.322
I know. I could have gone

20:00.390 --> 20:01.189
on the Internet, but the hotel

20:01.257 --> 20:03.958
doesn't have wi-fi. You wanna

20:04.026 --> 20:05.927
know somethin' weird?

20:05.994 --> 20:08.162
Brandie and Kimber both make

20:08.229 --> 20:09.196
that same face when they're

20:09.264 --> 20:10.063
takin' it from behind.

20:10.131 --> 20:12.365
Buddy, you're talkin' about... 

20:12.433 --> 20:14.000
you're talkin' about my wife.

20:14.068 --> 20:16.502
I... I meant no disrespect.

20:16.570 --> 20:17.636
She gave me a chubby. That's the

20:17.704 --> 20:18.437
ultimate show of respect,

20:18.504 --> 20:18.870
I think.

20:18.938 --> 20:19.738
You're lucky I don't throw

20:19.805 --> 20:20.605
you off the balcony.

20:20.673 --> 20:23.941
Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm sorry.

20:24.009 --> 20:25.309
You gotta admit it's the one

20:25.377 --> 20:26.410
thing these Henry girls are good

20:26.478 --> 20:28.646
at. Figured it'd be a way for us

20:28.713 --> 20:32.182
to bond.

20:32.249 --> 20:34.417
Please get out of my house.

20:51.215 --> 20:52.548
Ah. Got it.

20:52.616 --> 20:53.449
You are being

20:53.517 --> 20:54.984
too overprotective.

20:55.085 --> 20:56.917
Now, friends don't let other

20:56.985 --> 20:59.185
friends' wives drive drunk.

20:59.252 --> 21:01.620
I'm not drunk. I'm just

21:01.688 --> 21:04.155
relaxed. Bathroom.

21:04.223 --> 21:05.890
Ah. Right back here.

21:05.958 --> 21:06.790
This?

21:06.858 --> 21:09.760
Yes, right in there, my dear.

21:09.828 --> 21:10.661
There.

21:10.729 --> 21:11.295
Whoop.

21:11.363 --> 21:12.396
Just listing a little

21:12.464 --> 21:13.698
starboard there, Matey.

21:13.765 --> 21:16.533
Believe me, this isn't drunk.

21:16.601 --> 21:18.035
That night in Thailand when

21:18.102 --> 21:22.638
I had my fifth scorpion whiskey,

21:22.706 --> 21:24.807
now, that was drunk.

21:29.779 --> 21:31.245
Yeah, the sheets on the bed

21:31.313 --> 21:33.347
are actually fresh, as of this

21:33.415 --> 21:35.880
morning, so you're in luck.

21:35.947 --> 21:37.348
And where do you sleep?

21:37.415 --> 21:39.049
On the couch.

21:39.117 --> 21:41.551
Here. Let me. I had an easier

21:41.619 --> 21:43.053
time bivouacking on the side

21:43.120 --> 21:46.756
of Mount Kilimanjaro.

21:46.823 --> 21:49.592
Heh. Uh, towels are in this

21:49.660 --> 21:51.060
chest. Aspirin's in the

21:51.127 --> 21:52.594
bathroom. The water in the

21:52.662 --> 21:53.795
kitchen is filtered.

21:53.863 --> 21:54.495
I don't... 

21:54.563 --> 21:56.163
Ah, ah, ah. Stop. I'm gonna

21:56.231 --> 21:57.331
go to bed before you tell me

21:57.399 --> 21:59.599
about the time you boiled

21:59.667 --> 22:03.369
parasitic water from the Ganges.

22:03.437 --> 22:04.904
Good night, Sarah.

22:04.971 --> 22:08.639
Good night, Sean.

22:08.707 --> 22:10.674
Sleep tight.

22:21.084 --> 22:23.118
Heh.

22:28.122 --> 22:31.660
Mm... what... what the hell? Hey.

22:31.727 --> 22:32.894
Wha... 

22:32.961 --> 22:34.728
feel me, Sean.

22:37.831 --> 22:39.965
That's right. That's what

22:40.032 --> 22:41.999
you do to me.

22:42.067 --> 22:45.468
Don't. Please, just don't.

22:45.535 --> 22:49.303
I know you want me.

22:49.371 --> 22:51.938
The way you looked at me.

22:57.108 --> 22:59.242
And now I have tangible proof

22:59.310 --> 23:00.877
in my hand.

23:00.945 --> 23:04.713
I can't, Sarah. I mean it.

23:04.781 --> 23:09.853
I can't. What about Curtis?

23:09.921 --> 23:13.027
I love Curtis, but these long

23:13.095 --> 23:14.528
separations in our marriage

23:14.596 --> 23:17.731
have forced me to be more...

23:17.799 --> 23:20.767
Polyamorous.

23:20.835 --> 23:22.236
You have an arrangement or

23:22.304 --> 23:23.371
open marriage or something?

23:23.439 --> 23:25.008
No. I mean I have no idea

23:25.076 --> 23:26.276
what Curtis does when he is

23:26.343 --> 23:28.745
away. I can only assume that

23:28.812 --> 23:30.246
since our sexual encounters are

23:30.314 --> 23:32.648
at best sporadic, he finds some

23:32.715 --> 23:33.915
other way of satisfying

23:33.983 --> 23:35.316
his needs.

23:35.384 --> 23:37.986
Don't ask. Don't tell.

23:38.053 --> 23:41.188
He won't ask, and I'll

23:41.256 --> 23:42.655
never tell.

23:42.723 --> 23:46.459
Whew. Wow.

23:46.527 --> 23:51.062
Sarah, y... you are a beautiful

23:51.130 --> 23:52.964
woman, and I am attracted

23:53.032 --> 23:54.365
to you, but I can't do this

23:54.433 --> 23:59.236
to Curtis.

23:59.303 --> 24:02.973
Wow. I never expected you

24:03.040 --> 24:05.374
to be such a boy scout.

24:05.442 --> 24:09.111
I'm... I'm not. It's just that

24:09.179 --> 24:10.346
I've been there, I've done that,

24:10.413 --> 24:11.613
before, slept with my best

24:11.681 --> 24:13.115
friend's wife, and believe me,

24:13.182 --> 24:14.616
no amount of pleasure can

24:14.683 --> 24:16.583
make up for the guilt.

24:39.033 --> 24:40.634
She's gonna be fine, you

24:40.701 --> 24:43.502
know. I managed to reconstruct

24:43.570 --> 24:44.870
the floor of the orbit,

24:44.938 --> 24:47.172
the orbital rim, rebuild her

24:47.240 --> 24:49.607
ear, nasal cavity. There's gonna

24:49.675 --> 24:51.175
be some swelling, but we

24:51.243 --> 24:52.944
can deal with that later.

24:53.011 --> 24:54.546
I keep seeing it over

24:54.613 --> 24:57.517
and over. Give me something

24:57.584 --> 24:59.885
to help me sleep, please.

24:59.953 --> 25:03.655
I can if you want, but you

25:03.723 --> 25:06.958
might wanna talk to someone.

25:07.025 --> 25:09.592
Your friend has forgiven you.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.060
Might be time to forgive

25:11.128 --> 25:12.027
yourself.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.329
How can I? Every time I try

25:14.397 --> 25:15.830
to sleep, I see it...

25:17.766 --> 25:19.200
The knife plunging into his

25:19.268 --> 25:22.702
back and the eyes staring at me,

25:22.770 --> 25:26.006
pleading with me, "why, mommy?

25:26.073 --> 25:27.773
Why are you hurting me?"

25:32.246 --> 25:36.185
Did you know that 98% of

25:36.253 --> 25:40.222
their DNA is the same as ours?

25:40.290 --> 25:41.691
They can give us blood

25:41.758 --> 25:46.195
transfusions and vice versa.

25:46.263 --> 25:48.564
He would comb my hair ever so

25:48.632 --> 25:52.368
gently, and he'd make these

25:52.435 --> 25:54.203
little Clay statues while he

25:54.271 --> 25:56.805
sat in front of the tv,

25:56.873 --> 25:59.408
so expressive. I... I could see

25:59.475 --> 26:04.079
God in those statues. I couldn't

26:04.147 --> 26:05.414
have loved him more if he'd been

26:05.482 --> 26:14.288
my own. Sheila never approved.

26:14.356 --> 26:18.459
He could sense that.

26:18.527 --> 26:21.562
Maybe she was afraid.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.331
In light of what happened, her

26:23.398 --> 26:25.633
instincts proved to be correct.

26:25.701 --> 26:27.802
She didn't respect him.

26:27.869 --> 26:28.869
I mean, she should have known

26:28.937 --> 26:30.637
showing up in that new garish

26:30.705 --> 26:33.473
makeup would disorient him.

26:33.541 --> 26:36.709
And teasing him with that toy?

26:36.777 --> 26:38.378
You don't torment an innocent

26:38.445 --> 26:39.445
animal.

26:39.513 --> 26:41.047
Innocent? He practically

26:41.115 --> 26:42.181
ripped her face off.

26:42.249 --> 26:43.416
He couldn't help it.

26:43.484 --> 26:44.250
He didn't know what he was

26:44.318 --> 26:45.985
doing. She was the one who was

26:46.053 --> 26:47.019
a grown-up. She should have

26:47.087 --> 26:50.890
acted like one.

26:50.957 --> 26:55.361
But it was my fault, and I told

26:55.428 --> 26:59.965
him that. After they shot him

27:00.033 --> 27:02.501
and he just lay there in all

27:02.569 --> 27:06.372
that blood, I told him I was

27:06.440 --> 27:09.542
sorry, he was still my good boy,

27:09.610 --> 27:13.947
and I would love him forever.

27:20.121 --> 27:21.755
Someday, maybe she'll forgive

27:21.823 --> 27:24.358
me. I don't know, and frankly

27:24.425 --> 27:28.461
who cares? I'll never be able

27:28.529 --> 27:33.266
to forgive myself.

27:38.138 --> 27:41.607
Hey, I was lookin' for you.

27:41.674 --> 27:44.009
Everything ok?

27:44.076 --> 27:47.312
Yeah. Yeah, I, um... I was

27:47.379 --> 27:50.147
thinkin' how good Kimber looked

27:50.215 --> 27:53.583
in this one black dress she has.

27:53.651 --> 27:56.719
So beautiful, you know.

27:56.787 --> 27:59.621
Big tits, teeny little waist.

28:03.525 --> 28:07.795
I'm such an asshole.

28:07.862 --> 28:09.429
She really did love you,

28:09.497 --> 28:10.030
you know.

28:10.097 --> 28:10.964
Yeah, well, that was probably

28:11.031 --> 28:16.569
her biggest mistake.

28:16.637 --> 28:19.406
Listen, there's something

28:19.473 --> 28:23.410
that, uh, I need to tell you.

28:23.477 --> 28:26.479
Shoot.

28:26.546 --> 28:30.517
I need to take some time off.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.720
I mean, maybe we both do.

28:32.788 --> 28:33.855
Maybe we should just shut down

28:33.923 --> 28:34.656
the business for a little while

28:34.723 --> 28:38.993
and take a vacation.

28:39.061 --> 28:41.495
Where would we go?

28:41.563 --> 28:43.497
Well, I think we should go

28:43.565 --> 28:45.599
our separate ways for a little

28:45.667 --> 28:47.468
while. I mean, you and I have

28:47.535 --> 28:50.404
been together for 20 years

28:50.471 --> 28:53.139
practically nonstop.

29:00.546 --> 29:03.181
Heh. You're gonna work

29:03.248 --> 29:05.783
with Curtis.

29:05.851 --> 29:10.088
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'm gonna

29:10.156 --> 29:11.322
help the savior center build

29:11.390 --> 29:12.490
a hospital. That's what I wanna

29:12.558 --> 29:14.993
do. I don't wanna let another

29:15.060 --> 29:16.561
opportunity like this

29:16.629 --> 29:18.630
pass me by.

29:18.697 --> 29:23.201
Then go. But you go for

29:23.269 --> 29:30.407
a month, you go forever. Ahem.

29:48.889 --> 29:51.290
Come on. Heh. Does it fit?

29:51.358 --> 29:52.926
Heh. Well, you flatter me

29:52.993 --> 29:56.128
with a size 2, Christian.

29:56.196 --> 29:59.262
Yeah, it fits.

29:59.330 --> 30:02.896
Oh, yeah. It's perfect.

30:02.963 --> 30:05.729
Did you buy this on rodeo?

30:09.434 --> 30:14.471
Here. Try this.

30:14.538 --> 30:18.574
Wow. It's beautiful.

30:18.641 --> 30:19.541
Wanna try it on?

30:19.609 --> 30:24.811
Yeah. Of course. Heh.

30:24.879 --> 30:26.846
May i?

30:39.154 --> 30:40.720
What do you think?

30:40.788 --> 30:41.788
I think you look just

30:41.856 --> 30:47.092
as amazing as she did.

30:47.159 --> 30:50.194
Did I do something wrong?

30:50.262 --> 30:53.429
I don't know.

30:53.496 --> 30:56.964
I'm sorry. I just...

30:57.032 --> 30:58.131
Um...

30:58.199 --> 30:59.365
We can go shopping for a new

30:59.433 --> 31:01.566
dress. I don't know what I was

31:01.634 --> 31:02.600
thinking. I just... 

31:02.668 --> 31:03.868
no, no, no, no, no.

31:03.935 --> 31:05.335
It's good. It's good. It's all

31:05.403 --> 31:07.403
good. You've been so good to me,

31:07.471 --> 31:09.871
really. Really. I can't thank

31:09.939 --> 31:11.405
you enough. It's just a little

31:11.472 --> 31:13.606
strange, but it's good.

31:13.674 --> 31:17.108
I know. Well... heh.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.242
Just having you here's been

31:18.310 --> 31:21.076
a great comfort for me, so...

31:21.144 --> 31:26.980
Heh. She loved you very much.

31:27.048 --> 31:29.015
Yeah, maybe so, but something

31:29.083 --> 31:30.816
of which I'm not

31:30.884 --> 31:32.751
entirely worthy.

31:32.819 --> 31:34.719
No, don't say that.

31:34.787 --> 31:36.787
That's not true.

32:49.091 --> 32:53.729
My mother? My mother.

32:53.796 --> 32:56.431
She's a lovely woman.

32:56.499 --> 32:59.434
She's lonely. She... she lost

32:59.502 --> 33:00.268
a daughter.

33:00.336 --> 33:02.271
Come on, Christian. What kind

33:02.339 --> 33:03.772
of woman sleeps with her

33:03.840 --> 33:06.375
daughter's husband? And really,

33:06.442 --> 33:08.143
that... that's even a new low

33:08.211 --> 33:09.612
for you.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.947
We were giving each other

33:11.015 --> 33:12.450
comfort in a time of need.

33:12.518 --> 33:16.722
It's human. It's normal.

33:26.872 --> 33:27.771
Well, it's a good thing I'm

33:27.839 --> 33:29.206
dead so this isn't the final

33:29.273 --> 33:31.573
knife in my heart.

33:31.641 --> 33:32.808
Everything's a knife

33:32.875 --> 33:33.876
in your heart.

33:33.944 --> 33:35.078
So what are you gonna do now,

33:35.145 --> 33:36.179
Christian? You gonna take care

33:36.247 --> 33:38.751
of her? I mean, give me a break.

33:38.818 --> 33:40.522
You don't care about my mother.

33:40.590 --> 33:42.024
You're just using her like you

33:42.092 --> 33:43.492
do everybody.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.494
I am who I am, all right?

33:45.561 --> 33:47.162
You don't have a say in it.

33:47.230 --> 33:48.163
You killed yourself.

33:48.230 --> 33:50.232
You destroyed me.

34:14.328 --> 34:19.833
What is it? Tell me.

34:27.574 --> 34:29.809
I really miss her.

34:39.652 --> 34:41.286
I know.

34:50.860 --> 34:52.460
Hey.

34:52.529 --> 34:53.862
Dr. McNamara.

34:53.929 --> 34:55.428
Nsolo. How are you?

34:55.496 --> 34:56.862
Good. What are you

34:56.929 --> 34:57.530
doing here?

34:57.597 --> 34:58.597
Well, I know we don't leave

34:58.664 --> 34:59.830
for a few weeks, but since it's

34:59.898 --> 35:01.130
a Saturday, I thought I'd come

35:01.198 --> 35:03.464
down and volunteer for the day.

35:03.532 --> 35:04.632
We can always use an extra

35:04.700 --> 35:06.499
hand . We're helping the W.H.O.

35:06.567 --> 35:07.599
with an airdrop into Kenya

35:07.667 --> 35:09.166
on Thursday to help the people

35:09.234 --> 35:10.767
who suffered from the flooding.

35:10.834 --> 35:12.468
We have over 1,100 units still

35:12.535 --> 35:13.202
to pack.

35:13.269 --> 35:17.972
Show me where.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.507
Curtis.

35:20.575 --> 35:22.909
I'll catch up with you. I didn't

35:22.977 --> 35:24.243
think you'd be back yet.

35:24.311 --> 35:25.912
Ah, something more pressing

35:25.980 --> 35:27.280
came up here.

35:27.348 --> 35:30.183
Can I help? I've already told

35:30.250 --> 35:32.621
Christian, so I'm officially

35:32.689 --> 35:34.791
yours in a couple weeks.

35:34.859 --> 35:36.394
You know, you and Christian,

35:36.462 --> 35:37.895
you... you guys are a lot more

35:37.963 --> 35:39.329
alike than I ever thought.

35:39.397 --> 35:40.230
I mean, you come in here all

35:40.298 --> 35:41.898
eager like a puppy, and then you

35:41.966 --> 35:43.732
piss all over the carpet.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.100
Curtis, what's going on?

35:45.168 --> 35:45.834
I don't... 

35:45.901 --> 35:48.670
Sarah told me, you asshole.

35:48.738 --> 35:50.240
And when I got the call, I was

35:50.308 --> 35:51.309
holding a 3-month-old little

35:51.377 --> 35:53.677
girl severely malnourished,

35:53.745 --> 35:55.712
chances of survival practically

35:55.779 --> 35:57.079
nil. Her mother died of aids

35:57.147 --> 35:58.748
20 minutes earlier than that.

35:58.816 --> 36:00.016
You know, one less doctor there

36:00.084 --> 36:01.517
means many less lives saved, but

36:01.585 --> 36:03.986
I came home to save my marriage.

36:04.054 --> 36:04.954
Curtis, I don't know what she

36:05.022 --> 36:07.190
said, but nothing... I mean...

36:07.258 --> 36:09.593
Nothing happened.

36:09.660 --> 36:10.694
Don't believe you.

36:10.762 --> 36:11.495
No, I mean, we went

36:11.563 --> 36:14.331
to dinner. She... she got really

36:14.399 --> 36:16.367
drunk, a... and... we both were,

36:16.434 --> 36:19.036
but we both went right to sleep.

36:19.104 --> 36:21.004
Nothing... nothing happened.

36:21.072 --> 36:22.738
Nothing. I... I wouldn't... 

36:22.806 --> 36:24.140
I wouldn't do that to you.

36:24.207 --> 36:25.174
I wouldn't do that to us.

36:25.242 --> 36:27.409
Why would my wife lie about

36:27.477 --> 36:28.777
screwing an old friend

36:28.844 --> 36:30.379
from college?!

36:30.447 --> 36:32.048
I have no idea, but you... 

36:32.115 --> 36:32.982
you gotta believe me.

36:33.050 --> 36:34.787
No, I don't. And as executive

36:34.855 --> 36:35.790
director, it's gonna be

36:35.858 --> 36:36.492
impossible for you to work at

36:36.560 --> 36:37.960
the savior center or any of its

36:38.028 --> 36:39.362
affiliate missions, so just

36:39.429 --> 36:41.430
get out of here, ok? Go back to

36:41.498 --> 36:45.067
Christian. You two... you two are

36:45.135 --> 36:46.902
obviously meant to be together.

36:46.970 --> 36:48.638
Curtis, you gotta let... 

36:51.741 --> 36:57.111
ok. Here we go. Dr. McNamara

36:57.179 --> 36:58.679
is gonna be in today, and then

36:58.746 --> 37:01.881
we can schedule your follow-ups,

37:01.949 --> 37:03.483
ok?

37:03.550 --> 37:05.418
May I?

37:05.485 --> 37:08.920
Oh, absolutely you may.

37:08.988 --> 37:12.357
You know that Jane has paid all

37:12.424 --> 37:18.027
your bills. You know that.

37:18.095 --> 37:19.996
Ohh.

37:20.064 --> 37:21.064
You know, a lot of the

37:21.131 --> 37:23.132
swelling has not gone down,

37:23.200 --> 37:24.400
and when it does, we will then

37:24.467 --> 37:31.339
know how to proceed.

37:31.406 --> 37:32.973
It was never going to be

37:33.041 --> 37:37.544
what it was. He told me that.

37:37.612 --> 37:42.048
But still, we hope. I suppose

37:42.115 --> 37:43.682
I should take some comfort

37:43.750 --> 37:46.151
in becoming a poster child.

37:46.219 --> 37:47.552
If anyone had any doubts about

37:47.620 --> 37:49.420
the state passing that ordinance

37:49.488 --> 37:50.988
requiring owners to cage their

37:51.056 --> 37:53.356
exotic pets, they only have to

37:53.424 --> 37:54.557
look at me.

37:54.625 --> 37:56.725
Knock-knock.

37:56.793 --> 38:00.761
Oh, my. Look at you.

38:00.829 --> 38:03.597
You look beautiful.

38:03.665 --> 38:09.167
Well, you will look beautiful.

38:09.235 --> 38:11.102
Of course you're still swollen

38:11.170 --> 38:12.136
and bruised, but that's not

38:12.204 --> 38:14.137
surprising. I just knew they

38:14.205 --> 38:16.806
were the best. I knew we picked

38:16.874 --> 38:19.107
the right doctors to come to.

38:19.175 --> 38:20.275
You know, I was just telling

38:20.343 --> 38:21.242
her that she's gonna have

38:21.310 --> 38:23.043
to take it easy when you leave

38:23.111 --> 38:24.611
here tomorrow.

38:24.679 --> 38:26.513
I'll make sure of that.

38:26.580 --> 38:27.847
I've got the guest room all

38:27.915 --> 38:30.049
made up. It'll be like staying

38:30.117 --> 38:34.719
at a 5-star resort. And I've got

38:34.787 --> 38:36.687
a surprise.

38:36.755 --> 38:38.755
Oh, dear. That's not

38:38.823 --> 38:40.890
very relaxing, is it?

38:40.958 --> 38:43.425
Something to cheer you up.

38:43.493 --> 38:46.294
There. That's much better.

38:46.362 --> 38:48.630
Wait'll you meet gunther.

38:48.698 --> 38:50.899
He's hilarious.

38:50.967 --> 38:52.635
Your favorite.

38:52.702 --> 38:55.506
A little comedian in fur.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.617
Gunther? Jesus, Jane,

39:02.685 --> 39:03.585
you didn't.

39:03.653 --> 39:04.987
He's just a baby, Shu-Shu.

39:05.055 --> 39:06.222
He's nothing like Wayne.

39:06.290 --> 39:07.758
He's just the most adorable

39:07.826 --> 39:09.795
thing you ever saw. He's already

39:09.863 --> 39:11.163
using a fork and knife.

39:11.231 --> 39:12.865
You got another monkey?

39:12.933 --> 39:14.233
Chimp.

39:14.300 --> 39:18.803
Look at me. Look at me! Look

39:18.871 --> 39:22.173
at what that animal did to me!

39:22.240 --> 39:23.907
Look at what you did to me.

39:23.975 --> 39:24.641
Shu-shu... 

39:24.708 --> 39:26.142
you get rid of that ape,

39:26.210 --> 39:28.176
Jane. Stop showering all your

39:28.244 --> 39:29.777
affection on these animals.

39:29.845 --> 39:30.912
That's why you can't find love.

39:30.979 --> 39:32.880
There's no room for anything

39:32.948 --> 39:39.019
human. If you value our

39:39.086 --> 39:40.553
friendship, the 30 years we've

39:40.621 --> 39:42.755
known each other, you have

39:42.823 --> 39:48.293
to choose the monkey or me.

39:51.697 --> 39:53.898
That monkey loved me

39:53.965 --> 39:56.633
unconditionally. He never judged

39:56.701 --> 39:58.635
me, and he forgave me, even when

39:58.703 --> 40:02.972
I took his life to save yours.

40:03.039 --> 40:05.073
You think your heart will ever

40:05.141 --> 40:07.242
be that big?

40:20.589 --> 40:21.489
Hey.

40:21.557 --> 40:23.592
Hey.

40:23.660 --> 40:24.626
You mind if I have

40:24.694 --> 40:25.360
one of those?

40:25.428 --> 40:26.628
Sure.

40:32.235 --> 40:36.071
Where's Brandie?

40:36.139 --> 40:40.108
Wisconsin. It's for the best.

40:40.176 --> 40:41.709
She reminded me too much

40:41.777 --> 40:45.046
of Kimber. Aren't you supposed

40:45.114 --> 40:46.314
to be getting dysentery shots

40:46.382 --> 40:48.211
or something?

40:52.448 --> 40:57.751
I'm not going to Africa.

40:57.819 --> 40:59.086
Where's Saint Curtis

40:59.153 --> 41:00.487
taking you?

41:00.554 --> 41:04.723
Nowhere. Turns out he's

41:04.791 --> 41:08.760
kind of an asshole.

41:08.828 --> 41:10.328
Well, you never were too good

41:10.396 --> 41:11.663
at picking partners.

41:11.730 --> 41:14.265
Heh. He accused me

41:14.332 --> 41:15.532
of sleeping with his wife.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.166
Did you?

41:16.234 --> 41:17.200
No.

41:17.268 --> 41:18.434
Well, that's good, because

41:18.502 --> 41:19.535
sleeping with your friend's wife

41:19.603 --> 41:20.303
is very tough on

41:20.370 --> 41:22.305
the relationship.

41:31.947 --> 41:35.182
I'm stayin'.

41:35.249 --> 41:40.686
That's good.

41:40.754 --> 41:42.121
Thinkin' 'bout sellin' this

41:42.188 --> 41:44.556
place, gettin' a place

41:44.624 --> 41:46.291
up in the hills, you know,

41:46.358 --> 41:48.059
view of the city lights or... 

41:48.127 --> 41:48.893
well, you can't beat

41:48.960 --> 41:53.030
this view.

41:53.098 --> 41:56.367
Yeah. I used to love it,

41:56.434 --> 41:57.334
but now it's just like looking

41:57.402 --> 42:01.438
at a graveyard.

42:01.506 --> 42:03.539
It'll pass.

42:11.313 --> 42:13.647
It's good to have you back.
