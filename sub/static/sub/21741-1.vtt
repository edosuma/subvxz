<i>Can you feel the wind rising
from the north,</i>

00:34.467 --> 00:37.067
<i>the shadows deepening,</i>

00:37.400 --> 00:40.533
<i>and the spirits of the fallen,
calling to you?</i>

00:42.333 --> 00:46.500
<i>The sun will set three more times</i>

00:47.233 --> 00:50.100
<i>before Ragnarök dawns,</i>

00:50.600 --> 00:54.233
<i>the greatest online tournament
of all time.</i>

00:56.033 --> 01:01.400
<i>So, sharpen your swords,
and prepare for...</i>

01:03.433 --> 01:07.467
<i>the challenge of your life.</i>

01:49.267 --> 01:51.300
Sorry, Fenris, I was out of range.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.467
You better get your shit together
by Ragnarök.

01:54.533 --> 01:55.533
<i>Sure...</i>

01:55.600 --> 01:58.533
I won't be taking a dump
during the tournament, either.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.167
What? No bathroom for anybody
for the next three days.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.033
Oh, that's gonna suck, dude.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.100
But if it's gonna score the trophy...

02:11.767 --> 02:13.100
<i>But if you go deep</i>

02:13.533 --> 02:14.567
<i>into the cave...</i>

02:15.700 --> 02:18.433
<i>and touch the rock,</i>

02:19.400 --> 02:21.533
<i>there will be no limit
to what you can achieve.</i>

02:21.767 --> 02:24.533
- Tristan says...
- <i>Get out of here with your Tristan.</i>

02:24.600 --> 02:26.233
He hasn't been online forever.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.633
But is there another gamer
who won Ragnarök three times in a row?

02:29.700 --> 02:32.400
Tristan Shmistan.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.400
He's right, as usual.

02:35.233 --> 02:37.633
Look, the Cave of Destiny.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.033
CAVE OF DESTINY

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Upgrade's gonna...

02:44.467 --> 02:46.000
This area is neutral.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.067
Loki? What's he doing here?

02:51.633 --> 02:53.733
- Mom, fuck.
- <i>Fenris, you can't just...</i>

02:59.533 --> 03:03.500
<i>Are you sleeping
Are you sleeping</i>

03:03.567 --> 03:07.400
<i>Brother Jan, brother Jan?</i>

03:08.267 --> 03:12.200
<i>Morning bells are ringing
Early birds are singing</i>

03:14.333 --> 03:15.633
Oh, Mom.

03:17.633 --> 03:20.133
Rise and shine, sleepy head.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
It's quarter to already.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.500
Mom.

03:25.367 --> 03:28.533
There's nothing here
I haven't seen before, right?

03:31.767 --> 03:33.000
Snuggle attack.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.300
Oh, Jan, dear.

03:41.167 --> 03:43.733
We're proud of how
you've handled the last few weeks.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.633
You know I don't want to have
to send you to St. Anna's.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.533
But you've been sticking to our deal.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.067
And you strike me as more sensible,

03:54.700 --> 03:58.300
and mature, which makes me very happy.

03:58.700 --> 03:59.700
Bran?

04:01.333 --> 04:02.333
No, thanks.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.000
But you're right, graduating is the
most important thing right now.

04:07.267 --> 04:08.267
But, Mom...

04:08.667 --> 04:09.667
Yes, my dear?

04:10.233 --> 04:11.700
Jan...

04:11.767 --> 04:13.233
he is...

04:15.733 --> 04:19.200
He really is a swell big brother.

04:19.466 --> 04:20.333
That's right.

04:20.399 --> 04:25.300
And isn't it nice we have so much time
for each other as a family now?

04:26.233 --> 04:27.733
Banzai calling for Fenris.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.433
Banzai. Banzai.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.067
I was dreaming of you, bro.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.633
How romantic.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.500
No, not like that, man.
You wanna know what I was dreaming?

04:50.167 --> 04:53.300
I dreamed Fenris chopped the whole arena
into tiny bits of rubble,

04:54.200 --> 04:56.300
and chopped those bits
into even tinier bits.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.000
And you know what he did then?

05:00.167 --> 05:03.567
He took those tiny bits,
and chopped them into micro pieces, dude.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.367
I told you you're good enough to go pro.

05:06.433 --> 05:09.233
You keep up that way,
and we'll be raking in the dough soon.

05:13.667 --> 05:14.767
Speaking of which,

05:15.367 --> 05:17.467
when do we sign up for the tournament,
anyway?

05:19.433 --> 05:20.467
Hey, Jan.

05:22.733 --> 05:23.733
Hi.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.767
Hey,
you wanna come over to my place later?

05:32.067 --> 05:35.400
You know all about computers, right?

05:38.033 --> 05:40.200
SURE THING, HONEY.
NEVER, YOU WITCH.

05:40.267 --> 05:43.133
GOT SOMETHING BETTER TO DO.
BEHIND YOU, A THREE-HEADED MONKEY.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.200
Yeah, sorry...

05:45.633 --> 05:47.700
but I'm really busy...

05:49.433 --> 05:50.567
with practice.

05:50.633 --> 05:51.633
You know?

05:53.167 --> 05:56.067
Told you there's no point asking nerd boy.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.733
It was worth a shot, Honey Bunny.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.667
Good work, bro.

06:03.733 --> 06:07.233
Chicks gotta wait till
the triumphant victor returns from battle.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.433
- What's that?
- It's a pee bag, man.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.300
So we don't have to go
to the bathroom at Ragnarök.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.033
Hey, that's great.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.700
Thanks for your support.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.067
We're the ultimate team.

06:18.467 --> 06:20.500
Nobody stands a chance against me
and Gotrax.

06:26.133 --> 06:27.133
Gotrax?

06:28.767 --> 06:30.733
Yeah, who are you signing up with, anyway?

06:33.067 --> 06:35.167
I'm still keeping...

06:35.467 --> 06:36.733
my options open.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
That's great.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.367
Hey, I gotta run. Thanks, huh?

06:39.700 --> 06:40.700
See you.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.400
<i>Yo, Fenris, where have you been?</i>

07:33.467 --> 07:34.500
Sorry, real-life stuff.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.667
Status?

07:35.733 --> 07:38.100
Loki and Tin Can are still standing guard.

07:38.167 --> 07:41.433
They're ganking every noob
who even comes close to the Rune Stone.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.067
What?

07:44.033 --> 07:46.633
We need that upgrade
to stand a chance in the tournament.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.767
Together we'll destroy them.

07:49.733 --> 07:51.500
FROST AMULET

07:51.567 --> 07:53.700
I tank and you deal damage.

07:53.767 --> 07:54.767
Three...

07:55.400 --> 07:56.400
two...

07:57.067 --> 07:58.067
one...

07:58.733 --> 08:00.700
Ragnarök.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.267
Awesome level design.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.233
It's an honor
to share this moment with you.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.367
<i>That's okay.</i>

08:30.767 --> 08:31.767
Yeah.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
Yeah.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.366
Now no one can...

08:40.167 --> 08:41.167
Gotrax?

08:54.633 --> 08:55.633
LOGIN FAILED

09:23.433 --> 09:24.533
<i>Please, say, "Smithy"</i>

09:24.600 --> 09:26.700
<i>if you have a technical problem.</i>

09:27.333 --> 09:28.333
Smithy.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.367
- Smithy.
- <i>Welcome to the Smithy, adventurer.</i>

09:31.767 --> 09:34.500
- <i>Have you tried restarting your computer?</i>
- What?

09:34.567 --> 09:35.633
Of course I rebooted.

09:36.467 --> 09:37.533
Hello?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.133
<i>You're out, Fenris.</i>

09:39.200 --> 09:40.333
YOU'RE OUT,
FENRIS!

09:40.400 --> 09:41.400
Oh, fuck.

09:55.533 --> 09:57.267
<i>Okay, people, this is the real deal.</i>

09:58.233 --> 09:59.600
<i>The boss is right ahead of us.</i>

09:59.733 --> 10:01.300
<i>Everyone follow my orders now.</i>

10:01.367 --> 10:02.567
<i>No grandstanding,</i>

10:02.633 --> 10:05.167
<i>and most of all,
no sudden movements by the eggs,</i>

10:05.500 --> 10:08.400
<i>or else the pixels
will blow up around our ears.</i>

10:08.767 --> 10:09.767
Deniz.

10:10.267 --> 10:11.367
I don't know what to do.

10:15.567 --> 10:17.500
I'm right in the middle of a dungeon run.

10:18.733 --> 10:20.033
I can't get back in.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.333
Internet, smartphone...

10:22.267 --> 10:23.267
it's all down.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I've been hacked.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.633
That sucks, but I'm afraid I can't help.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.000
FROST AMULET

10:37.067 --> 10:38.733
Not like I'm a Game Master or anything.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Iced tea?

10:40.767 --> 10:41.767
Where...

10:42.033 --> 10:44.067
Where'd you get the Frost Amulet from?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.400
You must've got it from me.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.367
Did you send me that fucked-up text?

10:50.433 --> 10:52.633
- Hey. Tell me what it is.
- Hey, Jan. Let go.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.667
<i>We're toast.</i>

11:03.567 --> 11:04.567
Oh, man, Jan.

11:04.633 --> 11:05.633
<i>We're toast.</i>

11:07.100 --> 11:08.100
<i>Retreat!</i>

11:08.467 --> 11:09.467
What is it, man?

11:10.367 --> 11:11.367
Jan, stop.

11:11.733 --> 11:13.600
Come on, spit it out.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.200
He wrote me a chat message.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.667
We just wrote briefly, I swear.

11:19.733 --> 11:20.733
And?

11:21.233 --> 11:22.733
He wished me luck.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.733
And he wanted to know...

11:25.767 --> 11:27.100
if you had a pet.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Who?

11:29.333 --> 11:31.067
Who wanted to know about Frodo?

11:36.333 --> 11:37.333
Loki.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.533
You told Loki the answer
to my default security question?

11:43.200 --> 11:44.433
I'm sorry, bro.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
You're sorry?

11:48.300 --> 11:50.433
Oh, man, how can anyone be so stupid?!

11:51.267 --> 11:52.267
You know what, man?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.700
I'm not sorry, and now piss off.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.200
You're scoring high on the aggro.

12:00.033 --> 12:01.633
<i>His name's Loki, L-O-K-I.</i>

12:02.633 --> 12:04.233
<i>Yeah, he's pretty tall,</i>

12:04.433 --> 12:06.400
<i>and wears a black robe
with arcane symbols.</i>

12:06.567 --> 12:09.100
<i>His special abilities are fire spells
and necromancy.</i>

12:10.400 --> 12:11.767
He's the God of the Underworld.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.133
Can you handle this?

12:17.767 --> 12:19.433
Some kind of problem with...

12:20.267 --> 12:23.233
- a computer game.
- Not a problem, a crime.

12:28.133 --> 12:30.667
Have you tried restarting your computer?

12:32.333 --> 12:34.467
Is there an expert for cybercrime
or something?

12:36.033 --> 12:38.300
I am the expert on cybercrime.

12:38.767 --> 12:41.000
And you're welcome
to bring your computer in,

12:41.400 --> 12:44.700
but it better not contain
any illegal downloads.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.700
Programs, games, music.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.367
Horror films...

12:51.367 --> 12:52.367
pornos.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.533
MISSION
FREE FENRIS!

13:12.633 --> 13:14.567
DON'T WORRY. MEETING STUDY GROUP.
JAN

13:18.267 --> 13:19.700
MUNICH

13:32.533 --> 13:33.567
Hello.

13:33.633 --> 13:35.700
I'm... I'm here because...

13:35.767 --> 13:37.100
have a huge problem.

13:38.433 --> 13:41.567
I lost everything.
I even know who it was. Another player.

13:41.633 --> 13:42.500
Fill out the form.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.733
We'll look into it in the next two weeks.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.600
But it took me years to get where I am.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.300
And Ragnarök is in 63 hours.

13:51.733 --> 13:55.567
Then you'll have to fill it out quickly.

13:57.767 --> 14:00.233
ATTACK!!!
HAVE MERCY, PLEASE!

14:00.300 --> 14:02.500
TAKE MY GOLD!
BEHIND YOU, A THREE-HEADED MONKEY!

14:09.233 --> 14:10.267
Anything else?

14:20.200 --> 14:21.200
Oh, man.

14:21.700 --> 14:24.233
Goddamn paper-pushing bullshit.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.200
Fenris.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.200
Where?

14:46.767 --> 14:47.767
I'm Karo.

14:49.267 --> 14:50.533
Yeah? And?

14:52.567 --> 14:53.567
Gotrax.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.100
You're Gotrax?

14:59.633 --> 15:02.300
The invincible, all-destroying,
bloodthirsty Gotrax,

15:02.367 --> 15:05.267
The Butcher of Grimsberg, is a...

15:05.700 --> 15:06.700
girl?

15:07.433 --> 15:09.300
That's right, the one and only Gotrax...

15:10.633 --> 15:13.500
who kept Loki
from eating you for breakfast today.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.100
Without me...

15:15.400 --> 15:18.267
- Did it happen to you, too?
- Like a digital nuclear bomb.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.700
And Mr. Mikado won't tell me who did it.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
It was Loki.

15:24.367 --> 15:25.767
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:26.633 --> 15:29.567
I found out he got my password
from Luna...

15:30.167 --> 15:32.067
I mean, Deniz.

15:32.467 --> 15:35.100
If we find out his real name
we'll know where he lives.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.467
I know where Deniz lives.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.100
Not Deniz, Loki.

15:41.267 --> 15:43.067
We just have to get at his computer.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.500
I'll tank, and you deal damage.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.633
- We?
- Sure, we're a team, aren't we?

15:48.267 --> 15:49.267
Yeah...

15:49.533 --> 15:50.567
in the game.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.333
Victim.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.400
What?

16:23.633 --> 16:25.167
BOMB!!

16:50.033 --> 16:52.467
I'm Fenris, I'm a Level 69 Warrior.

16:54.533 --> 16:58.200
Careful with the backpack!

17:19.032 --> 17:20.300
Hey, Karo.

17:21.133 --> 17:22.133
Excuse me.

17:22.433 --> 17:23.733
Hey, what's wrong with you?

17:24.333 --> 17:25.666
You didn't wanna join me.

17:26.267 --> 17:28.300
You still didn't have
to make me a terrorist.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.133
Hey, where are you going, anyway?

17:35.633 --> 17:39.533
I didn't find out his real name,
but his IP is somewhere in Alp Valley.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.067
In Alp Valley?

17:42.300 --> 17:43.533
What do you care, anyway?

17:44.233 --> 17:45.267
I...

17:46.100 --> 17:48.167
I thought I may tag long...

17:49.100 --> 17:50.133
after all.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.300
- We're a team, aren't we?
- Yeah...

17:53.567 --> 17:54.567
in the game.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.767
If I can get Fenris back...

17:58.467 --> 18:01.433
and we win Ragnarök,
I'll let you have all the gold.

18:02.267 --> 18:03.267
For real?

18:05.067 --> 18:06.067
Swear it.

18:06.367 --> 18:07.400
Okay...

18:07.667 --> 18:08.667
I swear.

18:09.133 --> 18:10.133
No, for real.

18:10.433 --> 18:11.433
I...

18:11.467 --> 18:13.367
That is you, Fenris from the Far North,

18:13.433 --> 18:16.400
swear to bravely defy all danger,

18:16.467 --> 18:18.200
and if we win...

18:18.733 --> 18:23.433
to leave all the gold to me,
Gotrax, that is!

18:25.767 --> 18:27.133
What kind of oath is that?

18:27.533 --> 18:28.533
Say it.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.233
- I, Fenris...
- Louder.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.233
From the Far North,
swear to bravely defy all danger,

18:36.300 --> 18:38.333
and if we win,
leave all the gold to Gotrax.

18:40.133 --> 18:41.333
Welcome to the team.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Isn't that our train?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
Yes.

18:59.133 --> 19:02.633
<i>Dear Premium Customer,
I'm afraid I have to inform you</i>

19:02.700 --> 19:05.400
<i>there has been unauthorized access
to your customer data.</i>

19:06.033 --> 19:07.467
There were two players here who...

19:08.367 --> 19:09.367
That's right...

19:10.300 --> 19:11.533
Fenris and Anthrax...

19:12.333 --> 19:13.333
Gotrax.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.300
Should we have Technical Support
check it out...?

19:19.233 --> 19:20.233
No?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Hey, you,
don't get caught without a ticket.

19:35.033 --> 19:36.033
So?

19:36.100 --> 19:37.600
It's not like everyone has to know.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.067
I ride without a ticket.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.400
Sometimes I don't wash my hands
after taking a piss,

19:47.467 --> 19:49.600
and when I was 11,
I had the runs for a month.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.033
You're crazy, you know that?

19:55.467 --> 19:56.467
No big deal.

19:57.167 --> 19:58.733
Went right away with the right salve.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.733
Hey.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.000
"Tristan's Ragnarök Hat Trick."

20:10.400 --> 20:13.233
"Twenty Gaming Tips by Tristan."

20:13.300 --> 20:15.633
- Here, leave it.
- You really got nothing to snack on?

20:15.700 --> 20:16.700
No.

20:17.267 --> 20:18.533
Why don't you have anything?

20:21.667 --> 20:24.433
It would've got really ugly
if they found out.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.367
If my parents find out,
they'll send me to boarding school.

20:30.633 --> 20:31.633
Boarding school?

20:32.433 --> 20:34.133
Where do you think I'm coming from?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.700
I've run away like a million times.

20:36.433 --> 20:37.667
You sound like a felon.

20:39.467 --> 20:42.500
Well, year before last,
I borrowed my supervisor's car.

20:43.233 --> 20:45.633
Your supervisor let you drive...

20:46.500 --> 20:47.500
his car?

20:50.567 --> 20:53.167
Anyway, now I need money
to pay for the store window.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
What?

20:56.133 --> 20:58.567
How was I supposed
to know Shostakovitz burned so well?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.700
That's why
you're so into winning the prize?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.100
Yes.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.467
But you know
selling virtual gold is illegal, right?

21:14.100 --> 21:15.467
You have serious anger issues.

21:15.533 --> 21:17.300
Tickets, please.

21:18.433 --> 21:19.433
Going to the city?

21:19.467 --> 21:20.400
Damn.

21:20.467 --> 21:21.533
She's seen us.

21:22.533 --> 21:23.667
Let's get out of here.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.367
Hey, man.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
Shut up, you idiot.

21:27.433 --> 21:29.300
- Come on.
- Too late, now be quiet.

21:30.467 --> 21:33.100
Okay, now take your paws off each other,

21:33.267 --> 21:35.467
and then I'd like to see your tickets,
please.

21:35.533 --> 21:37.400
- Run!
- Now what?

21:38.167 --> 21:39.167
Stop.

21:45.567 --> 21:48.000
No one gets away from our train.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.300
CARD

22:20.667 --> 22:22.133
Could you look the other way?

22:26.200 --> 22:29.367
You can pull the emergency brake
in case of danger. We were in danger.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.467
- The conductor would've called the cops...
- Damn.

22:32.533 --> 22:33.533
Like I say.

22:37.067 --> 22:39.533
DEBIT CARD DENIED

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
Loki.

22:44.167 --> 22:48.167
It's not so hard to have them blocked.
Date of birth, card number, and owner.

22:52.267 --> 22:54.233
Speaking of anger issues...

22:55.133 --> 22:56.633
It's all a huge disaster.

22:59.233 --> 23:00.367
You're a disaster.

23:09.767 --> 23:10.767
Then we'll hitchhike.

23:13.667 --> 23:15.367
Can you trace an IP address?

23:18.467 --> 23:19.500
Since I turned 11.

23:26.233 --> 23:27.233
Mistywood.

23:29.467 --> 23:31.433
Do you think they've noticed we're gone?

23:32.333 --> 23:34.033
Hey, wait a second, Heisenberg.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.467
We need a plan.

23:36.433 --> 23:37.433
A plan?

23:38.267 --> 23:39.567
<i>Three persons in Quest Area.</i>

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
<i>Two NPCs.</i>

23:42.033 --> 23:43.500
<i>An enemy with limited range.</i>

23:44.033 --> 23:45.100
<i>I'll go in first.</i>

23:45.167 --> 23:46.600
Hello, I need to go...

23:48.067 --> 23:49.067
online.

23:50.267 --> 23:53.433
<i>Use the IP to find the right map
to lead us to Loki.</i>

23:57.633 --> 23:58.700
<i>Team attack.</i>

23:59.300 --> 24:01.233
- <i>Now it's your turn.</i>
- Hi there.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.367
<i>Ask about vegan products on supply.</i>

24:03.433 --> 24:05.467
Where would I find vegan products
on supply?

24:05.533 --> 24:07.500
<i>That noob will be totally confused.</i>

24:07.567 --> 24:08.567
Just look at it.

24:09.167 --> 24:10.467
It lists all the contents.

24:12.567 --> 24:14.000
<i>Distraction.</i>

24:14.167 --> 24:15.767
<i>Examine products critically.</i>

24:20.333 --> 24:23.033
<i>Drop it all
in the perfectly placed backpack.</i>

24:27.767 --> 24:28.767
<i>Retreat.</i>

24:29.267 --> 24:31.700
<i>While you distract the owner...</i>

24:32.067 --> 24:33.233
What's the big idea?

24:33.300 --> 24:38.200
<i>I'll finish up at the computer
and disappear with the loot.</i>

24:49.767 --> 24:52.600
WANTED!
10,000 GOLD REWARD

24:52.667 --> 24:57.367
Do you have any idea
how much gets stolen here every year?

24:59.300 --> 25:00.300
Lots of customers?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.067
Oh, yes?

25:04.700 --> 25:06.333
You just watch out, little Missy.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.467
Dad?

25:14.300 --> 25:15.433
Dad, they robbed us.

25:15.500 --> 25:20.633
<i>The hunt is on.</i>

26:02.767 --> 26:04.400
The perfect combo.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.167
Sausage cookies.

26:12.167 --> 26:13.233
Try one.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.600
What do we do when we find Loki?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.667
We'll figure something out...

26:39.733 --> 26:40.733
somehow.

26:58.467 --> 27:02.000
If I buy 100 healing potions in Utgard,
I can heal myself a hundred times.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.567
And here, I can't even open a can.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.267
Hey, what are you gonna do
if you don't get Fenris back?

27:13.533 --> 27:14.633
Kill yourself?

27:23.267 --> 27:27.400
It all went so fast,
you could hardly react.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.400
What's the world coming to?

27:31.567 --> 27:33.500
They were hardly more than kids, officer.

27:35.267 --> 27:36.267
The boy...

27:36.733 --> 27:38.600
was kind of tall, a bit of a wallflower.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.333
The girl had blue hair.

27:42.367 --> 27:44.267
That's what I said, blue hair.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.267
What's that supposed to mean?
Never heard of it.

27:55.700 --> 27:58.133
I'm gonna close up shop
if things go on like this.

28:15.133 --> 28:16.267
No one's ever gonna stop?

28:28.567 --> 28:29.567
What's that?

28:31.233 --> 28:33.300
Anne gave this to me before she took off.

28:34.733 --> 28:36.400
- Anne?
- My mom.

28:38.167 --> 28:39.367
I find it soothing somehow.

28:40.300 --> 28:41.300
Really?

28:42.567 --> 28:44.200
And this one helps making wishes.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.400
Wishes?

28:46.667 --> 28:49.467
Yeah,
if you send out a truly pure thought,

28:49.533 --> 28:50.533
you get what you want.

28:51.733 --> 28:52.733
From whom?

28:53.200 --> 28:54.200
The universe.

29:09.633 --> 29:11.300
Well, what did you wish for?

29:14.700 --> 29:18.367
Why not wish for a million Euros,
pay off your debts and get your life back?

29:18.433 --> 29:20.567
You only get stuff you really need.

29:23.167 --> 29:26.033
Life isn't a bonus level,
but it doesn't let you down, either.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.300
Pure coincidence.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.400
That's what you think.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.000
- Nice of you to give us a ride.
- Yeah.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.100
So, where to?

29:51.033 --> 29:52.433
MISSION:
ESCAPE AMBUSH!

29:56.100 --> 29:57.267
<i>Use Smartphone...</i>

29:58.267 --> 29:59.400
<i>with bearded coachman.</i>

29:59.467 --> 30:01.333
BEARDED COACHMAN

30:03.533 --> 30:05.667
<i>Combine cord...</i>

30:06.267 --> 30:07.133
CORD

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
<i>with car window.</i>

30:08.267 --> 30:10.333
WINDOW

30:12.733 --> 30:14.300
<i>Use coke bottle...</i>

30:14.700 --> 30:15.567
COKE BOTTLE

30:15.633 --> 30:17.033
<i>with mint candies, Karo.</i>

30:17.100 --> 30:18.100
MINT CANDIES

30:23.500 --> 30:24.567
Spit them in here.

30:40.167 --> 30:41.433
Let's get out of here!

31:13.467 --> 31:15.267
He isn't answering on his phone...

31:15.467 --> 31:17.233
or replying to texts.

31:17.300 --> 31:20.600
His sister tried to get ahold of him, too.
She always gets ahold of him.

31:20.667 --> 31:24.500
He's probably just at a friend's house.

31:24.667 --> 31:25.700
Or a girlfriend's.

31:27.333 --> 31:28.333
Not my Jan.

31:30.133 --> 31:31.433
Besides, we called everyone.

31:32.067 --> 31:35.767
Isn't this that kid
whose computer game was stolen?

31:37.333 --> 31:38.500
<i>Raclette.</i>

31:39.233 --> 31:40.233
<i>Rumpelstiltskin.</i>

31:40.300 --> 31:43.500
It's called Ragnarök.
The tournament is called Ragnarök.

31:43.767 --> 31:45.233
The game is called <i> Utgard.</i>

31:47.767 --> 31:49.267
And something's wrong with it.

31:51.767 --> 31:55.033
You have no idea where we are.

31:55.467 --> 31:56.467
Yeah.

31:56.533 --> 31:58.500
Distances looks shorter
on the map somehow.

31:58.767 --> 32:00.000
What?

32:00.233 --> 32:01.233
I said...

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Oh, shit.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.267
Is the mighty warrior pooping out already?

32:27.567 --> 32:28.567
Mommy...

32:29.033 --> 32:30.033
Pee-pee...

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Cold.

32:37.167 --> 32:38.600
The warrior is just warming up...

32:40.167 --> 32:41.367
lame troll girl.

32:41.433 --> 32:43.433
But I do twice the damage.

32:43.767 --> 32:45.633
But my sword is twice as fast.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.700
- You gotta duck Loki's fireballs.
- Duck.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.567
This is neutral Quest Area.

32:54.567 --> 32:56.533
Whoever's across last is goblin slime.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.533
Karo.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.233
<i>Fenris is still looking for me.</i>

34:20.433 --> 34:21.567
I already helped you.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.533
- What am I supposed to do?
- <i>Think of something.</i>

34:24.600 --> 34:28.467
<i>Threaten his family,
burn his house down, do something.</i>

34:28.533 --> 34:30.467
<i>Just make him go home.</i>

34:30.533 --> 34:31.533
Are you serious?

34:31.567 --> 34:35.733
<i>Everything I gave you,
I can take away with a single click.</i>

34:36.367 --> 34:37.500
He's still my friend.

34:37.567 --> 34:38.699
<i>As you wish.</i>

34:50.632 --> 34:51.632
- You okay?
- Yeah...

34:58.100 --> 35:00.000
Look, we'll make until there, okay?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.100
Come on.

35:16.300 --> 35:19.100
The Cave of Destiny
is kind of picturesque.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.233
Saved from your munchies.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.767
Got a can opener, by any chance?

35:53.700 --> 35:54.700
Still edible.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.067
Then I'll have to scare up some real food.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.100
And what's the...

36:06.300 --> 36:10.033
goofy teddy bear
who forgot his can opener gonna hunt?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.400
My favorite prey
are defenseless wood witches.

36:15.033 --> 36:16.400
Get that thing away from me.

36:17.767 --> 36:18.767
Come on.

36:19.633 --> 36:20.633
Come here.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.667
What's a one-legged girl gonna...?

36:25.267 --> 36:26.267
What?

36:27.567 --> 36:30.067
Okay, let's call it a tie.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.200
Can't we...?

37:25.600 --> 37:26.600
Karo?

37:46.633 --> 37:48.600
I'm loud and difficult.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.300
No one can stand me.

37:56.100 --> 37:57.100
What a mess.

37:59.667 --> 38:00.667
Yeah.

38:03.633 --> 38:05.000
What a mess.

38:15.067 --> 38:17.200
You're only here with me
because you have to be.

38:19.533 --> 38:20.533
But I...

38:21.433 --> 38:23.700
I promised we'd do it together.

38:32.333 --> 38:35.200
And Fenris
from the Far North keeps his word.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.200
Check it out.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.600
It all looks totally 3-D.

40:20.333 --> 40:21.367
Where'd you learn that?

40:21.700 --> 40:22.700
Survival blog.

40:25.533 --> 40:26.533
Well?

40:28.300 --> 40:30.167
Thou art a master craftsman...

40:30.733 --> 40:32.233
Fenris from the Far North.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.400
I can walk again.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.267
I can walk again.

40:44.367 --> 40:46.033
<i>I'll give Fenris back to you...</i>

40:46.100 --> 40:47.467
I'LL GIVE FENRIS BACK TO YOU...

40:47.533 --> 40:50.400
<i>if you join my team and drop the girl.</i>

40:50.467 --> 40:52.400
IF YOU JOIN MY TEAM
AND DROP THE GIRL!!

42:22.733 --> 42:23.733
Karo.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.100
Karo.

42:27.633 --> 42:29.100
I have to tell you something.

42:29.567 --> 42:31.667
- What?
- It turned itself off all by itself...

42:33.000 --> 42:34.433
- Look.
- What?

42:36.667 --> 42:38.067
It's just a big animal.

42:38.467 --> 42:39.733
- It's just a big animal.
- Yup.

43:05.700 --> 43:06.700
Come on.

43:51.333 --> 43:52.333
Don't come too close.

43:52.567 --> 43:53.567
We're dangerous.

43:55.267 --> 43:56.133
No, we're not.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.200
We're not?

43:57.667 --> 43:59.233
What are you doing here?

44:00.400 --> 44:01.400
We're being followed.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.200
By whom?

44:12.567 --> 44:15.667
For Yggdrasil!

44:24.333 --> 44:25.333
Time out.

44:27.300 --> 44:29.533
That's a real ax. That's not allowed.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.167
Isn't this the real-life quest?

44:32.133 --> 44:34.667
- What?
- The hunt for Fenris and Gotrax?

44:35.667 --> 44:38.100
Loki offered a reward
of 10,000 gold pieces.

44:38.167 --> 44:39.633
Virtual gold, of course, not real.

44:40.267 --> 44:42.567
- But the quest is real, of course.
- And not virtual.

44:45.233 --> 44:46.600
Whatever you say.

44:48.167 --> 44:50.500
But those two,
I think don't want to play with you.

44:54.033 --> 44:55.033
War council.

44:56.567 --> 45:00.267
I think Loki fooled us.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.367
Not now.

45:03.433 --> 45:05.033
WHO IS LOKI?

45:06.067 --> 45:07.500
I said, not now.

45:08.167 --> 45:09.600
So, you're Luna?

45:10.667 --> 45:12.300
What's going on?

45:12.367 --> 45:15.767
Deniz, this may be a little much
for you right now,

45:16.467 --> 45:20.367
but it's very important
you tell us the truth right now.

45:20.433 --> 45:24.433
If you know anything about where Jan is...

45:24.500 --> 45:25.767
I want a lawyer.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.533
Lawyer shmawyer.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.233
You tell us everything you know right now.

45:31.300 --> 45:32.333
<i>Tamame? Anastikme?</i>

45:32.400 --> 45:34.533
What does this place look like anyway?

45:34.600 --> 45:37.000
Cops in the house,
a total mess here, that pizza.

45:39.133 --> 45:41.300
Don't worry, we won't tell Loki anything.

45:41.367 --> 45:44.067
- Kick the wimp's ass.
- Fingers crossed.

45:46.433 --> 45:50.100
- For Yggdrasil!
- For Yggdrasil!

45:54.367 --> 45:56.600
Hey, thanks. That was way cool of you.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.300
- Don't worry.
- Oh, we could've...

46:04.733 --> 46:05.733
There's food in there.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.400
And a shower.

46:21.133 --> 46:22.167
It's like a fairy tale.

46:24.667 --> 46:26.033
More like the Middle Ages.

46:33.333 --> 46:34.667
You have Internet?

46:35.233 --> 46:38.000
Sure, I have Internet.

46:38.267 --> 46:40.233
I have electricity and running water, too.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.567
Here.

46:45.467 --> 46:46.467
Help yourselves.

46:50.233 --> 46:51.700
And you live here by yourself?

46:52.333 --> 46:53.333
Yeah.

46:54.167 --> 46:56.367
I was just sick of consumer society.

46:58.033 --> 46:59.033
Cool.

46:59.533 --> 47:00.567
Consumer society.

47:04.033 --> 47:06.433
I wanted to be my own boss.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.733
Independent.

47:10.167 --> 47:11.167
Do whatever I want,

47:12.000 --> 47:13.433
whenever, with whomever I want.

47:14.267 --> 47:15.267
Yeah.

47:16.033 --> 47:17.033
So do I.

47:22.433 --> 47:23.433
Bacon?

47:26.600 --> 47:28.567
And you made everything here yourself?

47:30.567 --> 47:33.533
Well, not everything.

47:34.067 --> 47:35.767
That's impossible.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.200
But I made this here.

47:39.000 --> 47:44.100
This table,
which I'm touching in such a sexy fashion.

47:46.033 --> 47:50.600
I wanna be touched in a sexy fashion, too.

47:52.267 --> 47:53.267
Me, too.

47:54.033 --> 47:55.500
I made something myself once, too.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.200
- What?
- What?

48:00.400 --> 48:01.500
Hey, thanks. But listen.

48:01.567 --> 48:03.700
I think me
and my girlfriend have to go now.

48:03.767 --> 48:06.533
We have to be in Tannenfels
tomorrow morning. Right, honey?

48:08.333 --> 48:10.567
It's not so far to Tannenfels.

48:11.200 --> 48:15.000
If you want, you can crash here,
and then I'll drive you over tomorrow.

48:15.067 --> 48:16.233
- No way.
- Way cool, thanks.

48:25.067 --> 48:26.233
It'll be worth your while.

48:26.700 --> 48:29.533
I wanted to inaugurate my pool tonight.

48:34.333 --> 48:35.333
What's your problem?

48:38.567 --> 48:41.700
This is a total random encounter,
just like in any role-playing game.

48:41.767 --> 48:44.633
A distraction from our real quest,
a complete waste of time.

48:45.267 --> 48:47.300
I'm not walking another step tonight.

48:47.367 --> 48:48.433
Hey, Ragnarök is in...

48:49.367 --> 48:50.467
12 and a half hours.

48:51.300 --> 48:52.433
We're having a pool party

48:52.500 --> 48:56.267
- with a forest gnome?
- You could be a little grateful to Ben.

49:00.133 --> 49:01.733
Do you even still want Gotrax back?

49:02.700 --> 49:05.400
- What kind of stupid question is that?
- Tristan says...

49:05.467 --> 49:07.067
Is that all you can think about?

49:07.133 --> 49:09.367
Don't you have enough
of your own crap to analyze?

49:09.433 --> 49:10.700
I don't jump in the lap of...

49:12.167 --> 49:13.200
Fuck.

49:13.267 --> 49:14.267
Apple juice?

49:14.533 --> 49:16.767
<i>Equipped with the skills...</i>

49:17.033 --> 49:18.067
NEW
THE LUMBERJACK

49:18.133 --> 49:20.000

49:23.000 --> 49:24.267

49:24.333 --> 49:25.700
<i>deadly ax blow...</i>

49:28.500 --> 49:30.367
<i>and double potency.</i>

49:31.200 --> 49:33.167
<i>The new superclass lumberjack</i>

49:33.533 --> 49:35.200
<i>will strike terror...</i>

49:35.267 --> 49:36.133
WOMEN
WILL LOVE HIM

49:36.200 --> 49:38.467
<i>in the hearts of all other classes.</i>

49:51.367 --> 49:52.633
Where are your towels?

49:53.467 --> 49:54.567
Under the guitar.

50:08.667 --> 50:10.200
You've got a great girl.

50:25.200 --> 50:28.433
It'll all work out. I've been there.

50:42.100 --> 50:43.467
She's not really my girlfriend.

50:46.500 --> 50:47.500
Yeah.

50:50.067 --> 50:51.333
But you like her, don't you?

51:03.367 --> 51:06.233
- Man, I see how you look at her.
- Is it any of your business?

51:29.300 --> 51:31.567
POLICE MANHUNT

51:31.633 --> 51:33.467
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

51:33.533 --> 51:34.767
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE

51:53.167 --> 51:54.367
What are you looking at?

52:00.433 --> 52:01.533
Not another step.

52:02.067 --> 52:03.067
Come.

52:05.233 --> 52:06.233
Come.

52:08.767 --> 52:11.233
Cowpat party with Thorsten and Macy.

52:11.300 --> 52:13.167
Cowpat party and the village gets crazy.

52:13.233 --> 52:14.233
That's right.

52:16.333 --> 52:18.067
Look them right in the eyes or else.

52:25.667 --> 52:26.667
Wanna dip?

52:30.633 --> 52:31.633
Come on in.

52:32.667 --> 52:33.667
The water's great.

52:35.167 --> 52:36.167
Come on.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
I'm a whale.

52:49.300 --> 52:53.133
- In your face. In your face.
- No, not in my face.

53:01.700 --> 53:02.700
Karo?

53:03.200 --> 53:04.200
What?

53:04.667 --> 53:06.633
Just relax now, okay?

53:07.300 --> 53:08.300
Come on.

53:12.100 --> 53:13.700
Come on in. You're wet already.

53:38.267 --> 53:39.267
<i>I'm in.</i>

53:39.333 --> 53:40.733
I'M IN!

53:44.733 --> 53:48.200
<i>Then come here. Alone.</i>

53:48.267 --> 53:49.567
THEN COME HERE... ALONE!!!

55:00.200 --> 55:01.200
Hi.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Loki?

55:18.733 --> 55:21.267
- Jan.
- Jan?

55:21.700 --> 55:22.700
Jan?

55:24.367 --> 55:25.367
Jan?

55:27.633 --> 55:28.633
Jan?

55:29.533 --> 55:30.533
Jan?

56:01.000 --> 56:04.433
Every workstation has 16 core processors,

56:05.300 --> 56:08.633
or 32, thanks to Hyper-Threading.

56:09.167 --> 56:12.167
And the CPU bases have Xeon Processors.

56:15.133 --> 56:16.133
Tristan?

56:20.500 --> 56:23.033
- You are...
- Loki.

56:25.667 --> 56:28.567
And it's an honor
to finally meet you in person.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.600
The warrior behind the warrior,
so to speak.

56:37.633 --> 56:38.633
This is Quang,

56:39.633 --> 56:41.500
one of the top Taiwanese players.

56:44.067 --> 56:45.667
I think he's from Korea.

56:46.300 --> 56:49.600
Who would've played with me,
but now you're here.

56:55.567 --> 56:56.567
So?

56:57.533 --> 56:59.233
How do you like your new kingdom?

57:02.367 --> 57:03.633
Truly amazing what they'll do

57:04.267 --> 57:06.200
for a few euros.

57:06.267 --> 57:08.633
You should consider getting
your own Chinese farmer.

57:09.700 --> 57:12.367
Stop. This is getting way too weird.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.700
Yes, I know.
I sure gave it my best shot, huh?

57:16.333 --> 57:18.167
Who could appreciate it more than you?

57:20.000 --> 57:21.467
We're so alike, Fenris.

57:22.500 --> 57:24.200
And we will write...

57:25.667 --> 57:27.133
Ragnarök history together...

57:28.767 --> 57:30.367
side by side today.

57:33.200 --> 57:36.433
But you don't have a lot of time
to get used to your new equipment now.

57:37.333 --> 57:38.333
Partner.

58:02.700 --> 58:03.700
Well, hell.

58:05.533 --> 58:08.733
You cowardly, egocentric shit.
I thought we were a team.

58:13.333 --> 58:15.567
Your knight in shining armor
took off without you?

58:18.233 --> 58:20.033
I thought we were a team.

58:29.467 --> 58:30.467
Neat, huh?

58:34.267 --> 58:37.467
Tristan put all his dough into this.

58:38.467 --> 58:39.467
All of it.

58:40.667 --> 58:44.567
But why? He's already the best, a legend.

58:45.100 --> 58:47.433
That's history. Proud elves are out.

58:47.500 --> 58:50.000
Tristan needs a comeback, a new image.

58:50.433 --> 58:52.167
Everything's about the clicks today.

58:52.233 --> 58:53.500
You got clicks, you got cash.

58:53.567 --> 58:56.200
No clicks, you go downhill fast.

58:57.400 --> 58:59.233
And we foiled his plan.

58:59.300 --> 59:02.767
Yeah, you and Gotrax as a team
would've squashed him.

59:03.033 --> 59:06.400
That would've been the end of it for him,
the knockout.

59:06.467 --> 59:09.600
So, he had to do something.
Ultimately, no one remembers the losers.

59:10.367 --> 59:13.700
Karoline Adamek, right.

59:19.033 --> 59:21.167
But I sent you the coordinates
a long time ago.

59:23.600 --> 59:26.000
Hurry up, please, okay?

59:26.400 --> 59:28.400
I don't know how long she'll be there.

59:33.733 --> 59:35.100
I´m going to look for him.

59:36.167 --> 59:37.667
Come on, Karo.

59:40.233 --> 59:41.233
Man...

59:42.433 --> 59:43.700
you're not serious, are you?

59:45.733 --> 59:48.400
You're not going after
that little nutcase because of...

59:50.233 --> 59:53.133
some silly game tournament?

59:54.533 --> 59:56.567
It's not even real, man.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.267
This here is all real, you know. I'm real.

01:00:02.367 --> 01:00:03.367
And this would...

01:00:06.767 --> 01:00:08.100
be real, too.

01:00:11.667 --> 01:00:13.367
- Real enough?
- Yeah.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.000
I felt that for real.

01:00:18.033 --> 01:00:19.033
Hey.

01:00:19.467 --> 01:00:21.133
Karo. Hey, hey.

01:00:22.067 --> 01:00:24.367
You won't get far like that.

01:00:24.433 --> 01:00:26.300
You said yourself it's not far.

01:00:26.367 --> 01:00:29.033
Yeah,
but you won't even get not far that way

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.233
I have to find Jan.

01:00:31.267 --> 01:00:32.267
And I don't care...

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:35.733
whether that's real or unreal to you.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:48.200
<i>Hail ye, brave warriors.</i>

01:00:49.467 --> 01:00:52.467
<i>Let it be Ragnarök.</i>

01:00:56.433 --> 01:00:59.233
<i>The rules are simple:</i>

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.500
<i>Assemble in pairs,
if you dare, if you are brave enough.</i>

01:01:03.567 --> 01:01:05.333
<i>But be warned:</i>

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.533
<i>You lose everything
to whoever vanquishes you,</i>

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:15.600
<i>and you're dead and gone for good</i>

01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:20.467
<i>if you die in this ruthless tournament.</i>

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.233

01:01:37.067 --> 01:01:40.100
<i>- That's a pretty penny.
- Right, but if you die here today,</i>

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:41.767
<i>your avatar will be deleted,</i>

01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:45.633
<i>and you have to start all over
as a level-one character.</i>

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:51.167
<i>I'm really excited to find out
which teams assembled this year.</i>

01:01:53.233 --> 01:01:55.167
<i>What? Okay, that's a surprise.</i>

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:57.633
<i>Fenris is competing with Loki?</i>

01:02:02.733 --> 01:02:03.733
CALLING FENRIS

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400
Idiot.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.533
Ready for digital immortality?

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:17.733
Of course, sure thing.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.200
- <i>Ten.</i>
- Here we go.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.400
<i>Nine.</i>

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.567
<i>Eight.</i>

01:02:23.767 --> 01:02:24.767
<i>Seven.</i>

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:26.100
Good luck, master.

01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:27.633
- <i>Six.</i>
- You, too.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.600
<i>Five.</i>

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.733
<i>Four.</i>

01:02:32.367 --> 01:02:34.000
<i>Three.</i>

01:02:34.733 --> 01:02:36.033
<i>Two.</i>

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
<i>One.</i>

01:02:39.733 --> 01:02:41.233
<i>Fight.</i>

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.433
<i>Oh, dude.</i>

01:03:01.233 --> 01:03:02.567
<i>Heavy blow from left.</i>

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.100
- <i>Nineteen-point-four seconds.</i>
- Yeah.

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:09.633
What? That's a new record.

01:03:10.233 --> 01:03:11.100
<i>Perfect.</i>

01:03:11.167 --> 01:03:12.287
19.6 SECONDS
NEW SPEED RECORD

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.167
Whew, the first round is over,

01:03:21.233 --> 01:03:23.300
separating the wheat from the chaff.

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:25.100
<i>Let's see how it goes on.</i>

01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:28.567
<i>All the low-level characters are down,
and now the chips are down, too.</i>

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.767
<i>A left-right combination,
and then a strike. Brilliant.</i>

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.367
<i>What a finisher.</i>

01:04:03.433 --> 01:04:04.733
<i>Thirty kills.</i>

01:04:09.567 --> 01:04:12.233
<i>Loki and Fenris are unstoppable.</i>

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.000
<i>What's going on with Fenris?</i>

01:04:16.067 --> 01:04:18.067
<i>- Disconnected?
- No idea.</i>

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.633
<i>I thought we were a team.</i>

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.467
<i>Why isn't he reacting? Oh, God, the troll.</i>

01:04:41.233 --> 01:04:42.733
<i>Trolls. Too slow.</i>

01:04:43.367 --> 01:04:45.700
And they never learn, but they burn swell.

01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:49.633
Master, there's a five-minute timeout.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.367
Then the finals start.

01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:54.300
Make sure all your cool-downs are ready.

01:05:30.533 --> 01:05:33.300
<i>If you send out a truly pure thought,</i>

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.467
<i>you get what you want...</i>

01:05:39.433 --> 01:05:40.500
<i>from the universe.</i>

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.567
<i>This is the MSI-GD65 gaming motherboard.</i>

01:06:00.033 --> 01:06:02.433
<i>So, for our first step,
let's install the CPU.</i>

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.333
Jan, are you crazy?
Have you gone completely nuts?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.533
Shit, Deniz.

01:06:13.167 --> 01:06:14.167
What?

01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:16.000
I'm really up shit creek

01:06:16.067 --> 01:06:17.067
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:06:18.367 --> 01:06:20.167
You have to take part in Ragnarök.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.700
What?

01:06:21.767 --> 01:06:24.367
You have to take part
in Ragnarök right now.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Are you crazy?

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.033
And why are we talking so quietly?

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.600
Please, Deniz, no questions now.

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.500
I just need your help.

01:06:34.267 --> 01:06:35.667
Got it, bro. I'm down with that.

01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:26.633
Are you focused?

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:28.667
Sure.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.400
Come on, let's show them who's boss.

01:07:32.067 --> 01:07:33.300
And win the finals.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.100
<i>Final open round.</i>

01:07:39.233 --> 01:07:43.433
Next up is the legendary final open round,
my friends.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.200
<i>Open to individual players, too.</i>

01:07:47.233 --> 01:07:48.433
<i>Three.</i>

01:07:49.467 --> 01:07:50.600
<i>Two.</i>

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.067
<i>One.</i>

01:07:58.267 --> 01:07:59.267
Deniz?

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.667
Wow, Low-Level Luna drew the wild card.

01:08:02.733 --> 01:08:03.733
LUNDA 99%

01:08:04.233 --> 01:08:06.100
What the hell? What are you doing here?

01:08:06.167 --> 01:08:07.633
Are you some kind of megalomaniac?

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.233
You're only level 22, and you're alone.

01:08:10.667 --> 01:08:11.667
<i>I'm not scared of you.</i>

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:13.567
Come here if you dare.

01:08:13.633 --> 01:08:16.600
I can take on four of you
with one arm tied behind my back.

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:17.667
Okay, fine.

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.000
<i>And the battle is on.</i>

01:08:20.533 --> 01:08:23.100
<i>Luna's got a big mouth, in any case.</i>

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:25.233
Let me handle it.

01:08:26.367 --> 01:08:28.100
I've got a score to settle with him.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.399
<i>Amazing. Fenris is going to handle it.</i>

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:44.500
Deniz, now.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.500
No, no, no.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.167
<i>If this is what you want, then...</i>

01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:56.233
confirm with K.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.000
<i>- It can't be.
- Why is he hanging around on the ground?</i>

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:03.000
Are you serious?

01:09:05.367 --> 01:09:07.233
You really want to give up all of this?

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.200
Jan...

01:09:12.233 --> 01:09:13.533
it's about the girl, isn't it?

01:09:16.633 --> 01:09:17.633
Forget the girl.

01:09:19.067 --> 01:09:21.067
I already called the cops.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.167
They're probably picking her up right now.

01:09:26.533 --> 01:09:27.533
I'm sorry.

01:09:32.633 --> 01:09:35.067
Listen, man,
<i>Battle for Utgard </i> is not real.

01:09:35.133 --> 01:09:36.433
I know that as well as anyone.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.466
But everything we're doing here is real.
Think about it.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.300
It's all intertwined:

01:09:42.567 --> 01:09:43.700
the stock market,

01:09:44.433 --> 01:09:48.466
the economy, politics,
the media, your supermarket.

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:51.133
Here, my fridge.
Everything that happens:

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.600
the whole world consists of data,
numbers, information.

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:55.433
There will never be a world

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.000
without Internet again, so,
a golden era's dawning for people like us.

01:09:59.433 --> 01:10:00.433
Your...

01:10:02.733 --> 01:10:04.467
virtual identity...

01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:09.067
will become more important
than anything else.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.167
That is the point.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.367
Just think what we can create together.

01:10:16.633 --> 01:10:17.667
It's absolute power.

01:10:39.767 --> 01:10:41.600
What the hell, dude?

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:08.300
- You don't understand a thing.
- <i>Fenris' property goes to Luna.</i>

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:14.067
Deniz, you have to stop him,
until Gotrax gets here.

01:11:14.133 --> 01:11:16.700
<i>And call Yggdrasil's Guardians.
You're my last hope, champ.</i>

01:11:16.767 --> 01:11:18.033
I won't let you down.

01:11:21.167 --> 01:11:22.733
We're not so similar after all.

01:11:28.467 --> 01:11:30.367
I'm the best. I'm a killing machine.

01:11:31.167 --> 01:11:32.300
Fuck.

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.533
I'm... I'm fucked.

01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:40.467
<i>You can't stop the cops from catching her.</i>

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.667
<i>And her troll is no use behind bars.</i>

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:46.567
Your sacrifice is too late.
You can't save her.

01:11:47.533 --> 01:11:49.333
What are you even doing?

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.167
<i>Loading quad riding skills.</i>

01:11:58.633 --> 01:11:59.767
<i>Systems online.</i>

01:12:36.433 --> 01:12:38.300
You insect. Come on.

01:13:02.567 --> 01:13:03.600
<i>Impressive.</i>

01:13:27.067 --> 01:13:28.067
Hi.

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:31.433
It has to be here somewhere.
Look out, there's someone lying there.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.300
My God.

01:13:40.267 --> 01:13:41.267
Is she hurt?

01:13:50.367 --> 01:13:52.067
For Yggdrasil.

01:13:52.333 --> 01:13:54.033
For Yggdrasil.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.167
And for Jan.

01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:05.333
Mighty spell of terrible confusion.

01:14:08.767 --> 01:14:11.467
Karo, I really screwed up. I'm sorry.

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.167
What are you sorry about?

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.100
Everything. We don't have any more time.

01:14:16.167 --> 01:14:17.633
Right. The tournament is on.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.667
Deniz needs your help now.
Luna can't stand up to Loki for long.

01:14:20.733 --> 01:14:23.267
Who knows how long
Yggdrasil's Guardians can help us?

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.733
Have you gone totally crazy now?

01:14:26.433 --> 01:14:27.533
You can get Gotrax back.

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:36.267
Karo...

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:42.000
I just felt really miserable next to him.

01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:45.333
I just wanted to go back to where...

01:14:47.533 --> 01:14:49.733
Where I am somebody.

01:15:14.567 --> 01:15:15.567
Scram.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.767
Before we arrest all of you
for obstructing an officer.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.633
Yes, yes, yes.

01:15:42.467 --> 01:15:44.000
- You got that?
- What?

01:15:45.033 --> 01:15:46.600
- Sure, why?
- I have to go.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.100
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:15:50.033 --> 01:15:52.167
Don't worry, you can do it.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:55.467
I don't want to have died in vain,
after all.

01:15:55.633 --> 01:15:56.633
What?

01:15:58.767 --> 01:15:59.767
And one more thing.

01:16:03.067 --> 01:16:04.233
You're a real disaster.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.667
But the best disaster
that ever happened to me.

01:16:16.733 --> 01:16:17.733
Go on.

01:16:19.167 --> 01:16:20.167
Go ahead.

01:16:24.067 --> 01:16:25.167
Come on, you can do it.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.200
We can do it!

01:16:28.633 --> 01:16:32.167
Sorry for leaving you like that,
but I need to use your laptop right away.

01:16:32.233 --> 01:16:33.267
Thanks.

01:16:35.367 --> 01:16:36.367
Gamers.

01:16:41.733 --> 01:16:44.667
<i>Guys, Luna is gonna bite the dust
in a matter of seconds.</i>

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.533
<i>You can really feel sorry for her.</i>

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.000
Are you on the ground?

01:16:49.267 --> 01:16:52.300
Are you crying?

01:17:03.133 --> 01:17:04.133
Got you.

01:17:06.133 --> 01:17:08.067
<i>This isn't a battle, it's an execution.</i>

01:17:08.133 --> 01:17:10.567
<i>Oh, my God. It's getting serious.</i>

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.400
Gotrax.

01:17:25.133 --> 01:17:27.000
Yeah. Finally.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.067
Goddamn it.

01:17:29.467 --> 01:17:33.167
<i>Who would've thought Gotrax would show up
at the last second and help Luna?</i>

01:18:01.567 --> 01:18:02.567
<i>Rats.</i>

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.433
No.

01:18:07.067 --> 01:18:10.467
<i>Amazing,
but Loki is channeling a giant megaspell.</i>

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.567
<i>He's desperately gathering
all the energy he still has.</i>

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.133
<i>And still, Gotrax and Luna manage
to escape at the last moment!</i>

01:18:36.733 --> 01:18:39.767
<i>Loki is totally confused.</i>

01:18:43.033 --> 01:18:44.400
<i>That's a mighty hit from Luna.</i>

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.233
You shouldn't have messed with a team...

01:18:53.133 --> 01:18:54.300
single player.

01:19:43.433 --> 01:19:45.733
For Yggdrasil!

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.300
And for Karo!

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:49.700
And for Ben!

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.333
And for Jan!

01:20:02.333 --> 01:20:04.500
I'm not sure if I understood this,

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:07.733
but you claim to be Karoline Adamek.

01:20:08.533 --> 01:20:09.600
Virtually?

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.500
That's right.

01:20:12.067 --> 01:20:14.633
I hacked her system
and stole her identity.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:21.433
So, you really committed
all the crimes she's accused of?

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.500
Yeah.

01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:27.600
And I have no idea where
this Karo person is.

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:31.667
Pretty wild.

01:20:32.633 --> 01:20:34.700
What you can do technically nowadays.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.600
Lechner, hello? Yes?

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:06.633
You found him?

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.733
And he's okay?

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:12.667
You got Jan back.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.733
That was it, all right. Ragnarök is over.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Incredible.

01:21:19.067 --> 01:21:21.433
Oh, my God. Gotrax and Luna,
the Wild Card kids,

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.033
popped up and turned it around.

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.033
<i>That was it from Ragnarök for this year.</i>

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:29.033
<i>See you again next year.</i>

01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:31.667
Tristan...

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.067
you'll always be the greatest to me.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.400
For Yggdrasil!

01:21:57.033 --> 01:21:58.733
For Yggdrasil!

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.267
THREE MONTHS LATER

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.267
Got you, Mr. Lechner.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.700
Detention.

01:22:56.267 --> 01:23:00.000
- You should see your face, teacher's pet.
- What are you doing here?

01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:07.133
I heard you're in urgent need
of a LAN party... for two.

01:23:08.433 --> 01:23:10.000
What do you look like?

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.167
So, did you pay Shostakovitz?

01:23:18.467 --> 01:23:20.600
Selling virtual gold is illegal.

01:23:21.067 --> 01:23:22.067
Right.

01:23:22.467 --> 01:23:24.567
So,
I bought an armored flying lizard instead.

01:23:26.233 --> 01:23:27.533
You're a total disaster.

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.267
Just for that, I can do quadruple damage.

01:23:31.333 --> 01:23:32.667
Quintuple damage!

01:24:20.533 --> 01:24:21.667
SNUGGLE ATTACK

01:24:22.305 --> 01:24:28.501
