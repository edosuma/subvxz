WEBVTT

00:01.183 --> 00:03.142
You've dropped another one.

00:03.143 --> 00:06.863
I don't see why we couldn't just
catch the bus like any normal person.

00:07.943 --> 00:09.583
I could give you a piggyback?

00:10.983 --> 00:13.021
And what would the Adamses say

00:13.120 --> 00:15.959
if we turned up at Ruby's
birthday like that?

00:15.960 --> 00:18.319
Well, it was good enough
for St Christopher.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.521
Anyway, you can't be the best
pastry chef this side of Paris

00:21.522 --> 00:24.800
and maintain peak fitness.
Nobody's perfect.

00:24.801 --> 00:29.880
Not that you'd know it if you met
the Adams. They're the model family.

00:29.881 --> 00:31.281
Nobody's perfect.

00:53.561 --> 00:54.641
Here, darling.

00:55.641 --> 00:57.081
Let me.

00:59.201 --> 01:00.321
Mm.

01:11.921 --> 01:14.000
It's just a little one.

01:14.001 --> 01:17.281
It's my daughter's birthday,
I'm allowed a little one.

01:19.961 --> 01:22.239
You promised me!
We're going to be late.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.119
I won't have Ruby see you like this.
You're hurting me!

01:25.120 --> 01:28.361
You know what I said, if you went
back on the drink - I meant it!

01:31.481 --> 01:35.920
I want a divorce. Have you forgotten
what YOU promised?

01:35.921 --> 01:38.559
Catholic marriage
is till death do us part.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.041
Yours will be sooner rather
than later, the way you're going.

01:42.042 --> 01:45.240
Is that a threat? No.
Well, it ought to be.

01:45.241 --> 01:47.441
The only way I leave this
marriage...

01:48.481 --> 01:49.961
is in a coffin.

02:32.201 --> 02:36.440
Does your godmother get
a birthday kiss, too? Don't worry.

02:36.441 --> 02:39.079
I don't want to give your
poor father a coronary.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.119
Your secret's safe with me.
It's not a secret.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.801
We're making the announcement today.
John and I are engaged.

02:45.802 --> 02:50.240
- Over my dead body. Mum...
- Engaged to the tutor?

02:50.241 --> 02:55.840
My daughter is not marrying
a lowlife trot like you. You think?

02:55.841 --> 03:00.119
What will you do about it?
She's not herself, she'll come
round. Like hell I will.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.081
She needs my permission to marry.
And I'm not giving it.

03:03.082 --> 03:06.400
So you can whistle for your wedding.

03:06.401 --> 03:08.400
Oh, and Mr Van Ert...

03:08.401 --> 03:10.001
you're fired.

03:13.681 --> 03:15.840
Egyptian, this one.

03:15.841 --> 03:19.959
What kind of a cheapskate puts a
foreign coin in a church collection?

03:19.960 --> 03:22.039
Better than a button. I don't know.

03:22.040 --> 03:25.559
I came across some rather nice ones
this morning, Father.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.439
When I get six that match,
they're going on one of my cardies.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.761
Perhaps you can mend the hole
in my pocket while you're at it.

03:32.762 --> 03:36.761
I am the parish secretary,
not your seamstress.

03:38.561 --> 03:40.640
Why are we bringing these?

03:40.641 --> 03:44.001
The colonel travels. He might be able
to give you some real money

03:44.002 --> 03:47.320
for them, waste not want not.

03:47.321 --> 03:51.441
Leave me alone!
I won't put up with this!

03:52.521 --> 03:56.081
Are we late?
Or has the play started early?

04:06.401 --> 04:09.281
Father,
you didn't see notice on the gate?

04:09.282 --> 04:11.480
We cut across the fields.

04:11.481 --> 04:15.560
Party's cancelled.
Mrs Adams is... unwell.

04:15.561 --> 04:19.401
Father, I'm sorry you've come
all this way. The play's off.

04:19.402 --> 04:22.520
Did you hear Ann-Marie...?
Rehearsing.

04:22.521 --> 04:27.400
She didn't want to let people down.
But the fever's too strong.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.601
Well... As we're here...

04:31.801 --> 04:34.960
The least we can do is help you
clear up.

04:34.961 --> 04:38.399
I've just finished. But there's
masses of cake in the kitchen.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.481
You can certainly help us with that.

04:50.841 --> 04:53.839
Where are you going?
This is very decent of you.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.199
I'm glad
you understand our position.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.279
Dad, you can't make him go.
No-one's making me do anything.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.039
John? I'm not leaving Ruby -
just your house.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.561
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
What about us? There is no "us".

05:08.001 --> 05:10.639
Your mother and I can't bless
this engagement,

05:10.640 --> 05:13.519
and without our consent,
marriage isn't an option.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.679
Then, we'll just wait a year.
We don't even have to do that.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.521
This is the '50s.
Who says we need to get married?

05:24.601 --> 05:28.081
You step over this threshold,
you're never coming back.

05:30.001 --> 05:31.441
I HATE you.

05:33.481 --> 05:36.521
And don't think your mother will say
any differently!

05:37.561 --> 05:40.201
Certainly not
in the state SHE'S in.

05:55.042 --> 06:16.206
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

06:39.321 --> 06:43.280
Now, dear, come on. You drink this.

06:43.281 --> 06:45.760
It's all right.

06:45.761 --> 06:48.241
Where's that blanket? She's frozen.

06:49.401 --> 06:51.041
Wrap it around her, quickly.

06:53.281 --> 06:56.360
Not a word about the argument,
all right?

06:56.361 --> 06:58.721
I don't want her remembered
like that, Ruby.

07:00.161 --> 07:01.401
Deal?

07:03.521 --> 07:06.801
There's nothing we could have done.
She's already stiff.

07:08.961 --> 07:13.241
I... I really... It's an
unfortunate accident. Nothing more.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.881
What about the scratches
around her neck?

07:19.161 --> 07:22.321
Probably from twigs
and weeds in the water.

07:23.881 --> 07:27.881
You can stand down now, Father.
I'm satisfied everything's in order.

07:29.761 --> 07:32.961
Unless this is a clue?

07:34.321 --> 07:35.919
Italian, by the look of it.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.321
That must narrow down
our pool of suspects, eh, Father?

07:39.322 --> 07:41.760
That? Er... no.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.121
That must be mine.

07:46.721 --> 07:49.601
It seems like
everyone is hiding something.

07:49.602 --> 07:54.760
If I tell you, you must promise
to let it drop, on your honour.

07:54.761 --> 07:58.081
If it's not criminal, I promise.

07:59.161 --> 08:00.681
She was tight.

08:01.961 --> 08:04.041
She'd had most
of the bottle of vodka.

08:04.042 --> 08:08.560
I'm amazed she didn't fall over
sooner. She was an alcoholic.

08:08.561 --> 08:12.001
Now you know why Reginald didn't
want the whole world to know.

08:12.002 --> 08:15.080
Speaking of peccadilloes...

08:15.081 --> 08:17.639
if that's the quality of mourner
around here,

08:17.640 --> 08:20.121
I'll be dropping by more often.
Who's that?

08:20.122 --> 08:21.601
I don't know.

08:25.121 --> 08:29.080
Felicia. Welcome to Kembleford.

08:29.081 --> 08:32.360
Planning a long visit? I am now.

08:32.361 --> 08:35.721
Father Brown. My condolences.

08:36.801 --> 08:38.880
Mr... Short?

08:38.881 --> 08:42.520
Oh, no. My old nanny.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.121
Chrysanthemums
always were her favourite.

08:45.122 --> 08:47.161
But she was the Adams' nanny.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.360
You aren't Anne-Marie's brother?

08:51.361 --> 08:54.999
On my way to see the family now.
Are they expecting you?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.479
Everybody loves a surprise,
don't they?

08:57.480 --> 09:02.081
I came straight from London airport,
flew in from Nairobi this morning.

09:02.082 --> 09:04.441
So, you haven't heard? Heard what?

09:16.641 --> 09:21.119
Scared the hell out of me. Thought
you were a robber or a brigand.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.081
Maybe I am.
I think I've rather a talent for it.

09:25.561 --> 09:29.599
I can't see any harm in it anyhow.
How can you even say that?

09:29.600 --> 09:32.521
I want to steal YOU away.
Is that a crime?

09:32.522 --> 09:38.080
Then, why didn't you come back after
we found Mum? I needed you. I did!

09:38.081 --> 09:39.799
The place was full of police.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.799
Your dad said he'd have me arrested
for trespass.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.681
What? And you just went?
I'm not a citizen. I can't risk it.

09:48.161 --> 09:52.001
Run away with me, Ruby,
and leave them all behind.

09:53.441 --> 09:56.040
Dad's falling apart, he needs me.

09:56.041 --> 09:58.561
Now is not a good time.
Well, when is?

10:01.601 --> 10:05.119
At least your mom isn't going
to make any problems any more.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.879
I didn't mean it like that!

10:06.880 --> 10:09.521
You sound like you're glad
she's dead.

10:13.361 --> 10:17.040
Eternal rest,
grant unto her, O Lord.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.400
And let perpetual light
shine upon her.

10:20.401 --> 10:22.600
And may she rest in peace.

10:22.601 --> 10:24.081
Amen.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.841
I'm sorry. I was...

10:31.841 --> 10:34.640
Who are you?
Ruby, don't be so rude.

10:34.641 --> 10:37.279
There's no reason
for her to recognise me.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.161
Even I don't have many photographs
of me and your mum.

10:40.162 --> 10:42.441
But I want you to have this.

10:46.441 --> 10:48.680
Some things never change.

10:48.681 --> 10:52.800
We were rehearsing for some play
she'd come up with.

10:52.801 --> 10:56.840
Look at the get-up I was in.
Uncle James?

10:56.841 --> 11:00.481
Not looking too bad for
two decades in the Kenyan sun.

11:00.482 --> 11:03.800
Happy Valley must have lived
up to its name.

11:03.801 --> 11:05.160
I can't complain.

11:05.161 --> 11:09.000
Apart from
arriving back here too late.

11:09.001 --> 11:13.120
What happened?
I heard the bare bones but...

11:13.121 --> 11:15.800
The jetty's very slippery.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.599
I have been meaning
to shorten the rope on the boat

11:18.600 --> 11:20.721
but maybe she tripped
on the mooring.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.201
Or lost her balance on the boat.

11:25.241 --> 11:26.721
Here we are, Father.

11:28.241 --> 11:31.800
Not a patch on mine, but edible.

11:31.801 --> 11:35.560
Since you sell it so well,
I'll pass.

11:35.561 --> 11:39.881
Hold the fort, would you,
please, Mrs M? Call of nature.

11:53.601 --> 11:56.960
Father. Father, what are you doing?

11:56.961 --> 11:58.600
Didn't you hear Ruby?

11:58.601 --> 12:02.001
That's probably what happened
to poor Anne-Marie.

12:06.281 --> 12:08.721
There's blood, under this oar.

12:09.961 --> 12:13.600
Well, maybe she fell into the boat

12:13.601 --> 12:16.161
and then hit her head on the oar
in there.

12:16.162 --> 12:18.000
That's impossible.

12:18.001 --> 12:22.400
But the oars were right there
when Ruby found her mother.

12:22.401 --> 12:26.520
Which tells us
that Anne-Marie was hit by the oar

12:26.521 --> 12:29.041
and then the oar was put back.

12:31.721 --> 12:35.521
Can I tempt you to some more Barolo?
Oh.

12:40.921 --> 12:44.560
Come on, let's send her off
the way she lived.

12:44.561 --> 12:47.000
To my sister. Anne-Marie.

12:47.001 --> 12:48.881
Mrs Adams.

12:50.761 --> 12:54.921
Father, police are here.
I'm sorry, they ask questions.

12:56.481 --> 13:01.120
Inspector.
May I speak to you outside?

13:01.121 --> 13:04.481
I've just come from the lake.
I need to speak to the colonel.

13:06.841 --> 13:11.440
Valentine? I need to speak to you
urgently about Mrs Adams' death.

13:11.441 --> 13:14.201
I don't think so.
It is rather important.

13:14.202 --> 13:16.560
What could be so important now?

13:16.561 --> 13:20.041
I believe it was murder.
I believe you were involved.

13:23.521 --> 13:27.879
Where's the motive? This is
ridiculous, Valentine, even for you.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.919
Susie Jasinski works for you, too,
am I right, Father?

13:30.920 --> 13:33.359
She's my housekeeper
but I don't see...

13:33.360 --> 13:35.559
And you consider her trustworthy?

13:35.560 --> 13:38.439
Yes, but...
Miss Jasinski's just told me that,

13:38.440 --> 13:42.241
minutes before the murder, she heard
you threatening Mrs Adams' life.

13:42.242 --> 13:47.200
What? But that's preposterous.
He asked for a divorce.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.799
It can't be murder, it can't!

13:48.800 --> 13:51.601
And even if it were,
it certainly wasn't Reginald!

13:51.602 --> 13:56.520
What scares me is, in that case,
the real killer still walking free.

13:56.521 --> 13:58.720
Is it just me who's thinking it?

13:58.721 --> 14:01.921
She'd just fired Van Ert,
forbidden your marriage.

14:01.922 --> 14:03.720
No way. Not John.

14:03.721 --> 14:07.519
They say most murders are committed
by someone known to the victim.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.999
Who is this... Van Ert?
Ruby's old tutor.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.799
He was thrown out of the States
for being a Red.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.999
A Communist? Yeah.
He must hate the aristocracy.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.081
The unfairness of people
living in a pile like this.

14:20.121 --> 14:22.600
Maybe HE was after the diamonds.

14:22.601 --> 14:25.599
That's what they're all about -
redistribution of wealth.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.359
It's true, he left pretty sharpish
after she died.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.119
Because he'd just been sacked!

14:30.120 --> 14:32.641
I'm sorry, Ruby,
but it has to be Van Ert.

14:33.761 --> 14:39.080
Do you deny that after she told you
marriage was till death do you part,

14:39.081 --> 14:43.041
you said, "Well, yours is going to be
sooner rather than later?"

14:43.042 --> 14:44.361
Yes!

14:45.921 --> 14:49.601
Well, no,
but I didn't mean I'd kill her!

14:50.881 --> 14:53.999
We'd have come to an arrangement,
worked something out.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.040
Mrs Adams was one of your lot.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.159
Would she ever have agreed
to a divorce?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.599
As a devout Catholic,
no, she would never...

15:00.600 --> 15:04.801
So we know the Colonel wanted out and
his wife would never have let him go.

15:04.802 --> 15:08.241
We have motive, means,
AND opportunity.

15:10.601 --> 15:13.519
Colonel, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.639
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so

15:16.640 --> 15:19.359
but whatever you say
will be taken down in writing

15:19.360 --> 15:20.921
and may be given in evidence.

15:23.161 --> 15:24.479
They have to let Dad out -

15:24.480 --> 15:26.599
it's Mum's funeral,
for heaven's sake.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.321
The solicitor's doing everything
he can. I'll try calling him again.

15:32.281 --> 15:34.640
You look...

15:34.641 --> 15:35.999
Like a dog's dinner.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.359
It's very kind of the colonel
to lend me his things,

15:39.360 --> 15:40.921
but the suit's too short and,

15:40.922 --> 15:44.280
as I said when I called,
his shoes are huge.

15:44.281 --> 15:46.641
Like clown feet. Size eight, right?

15:48.041 --> 15:50.441
You're lucky
my husband's not a big man.

16:02.441 --> 16:05.080
Perfect.
It all feels like a costume.

16:05.081 --> 16:07.880
Annie always did love
a bit of theatre.

16:07.881 --> 16:11.001
It's a shame her last play
never got performed. It didn't?

16:11.002 --> 16:14.760
It was supposed to go on
the night she...

16:14.761 --> 16:16.840
The evening of the...

16:16.841 --> 16:21.840
I'm sorry... Hey, don't do that.
I can't stand tears.

16:21.841 --> 16:23.801
I'm forced to do the most terrible,

16:23.802 --> 16:27.561
out-of-character things
to try and stop them. Such as?

16:55.121 --> 16:57.041
We have to talk. Not now, John.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.799
Don't look at me like that.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.719
Half the village is giving me
that expression.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.721
You don't really believe
I killed her. Do you?

17:05.722 --> 17:08.800
Of course not.
Then, I need your help.

17:14.761 --> 17:17.118
Your mother's death,
a community like this,

17:17.119 --> 17:19.319
it's always going to blame
the outsider.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.721
What are you saying?
If you love me...

17:22.761 --> 17:24.161
I need an alibi.

17:27.441 --> 17:29.761
Well, there's a turn-up
for the books.

17:41.881 --> 17:44.401
Colonel,
I'm sorry I talked to Inspector.

17:44.402 --> 17:46.720
I didn't mean to make trouble.

17:46.721 --> 17:49.001
We all want the same thing, Susie -

17:49.002 --> 17:52.080
to see my wife's killer put away.

17:52.081 --> 17:54.721
It wasn't me. Do you believe me?

17:56.801 --> 17:58.241
Am I fired?

17:59.921 --> 18:01.681
At least you're upfront.

18:07.881 --> 18:10.081
Colonel Adams, welcome.

18:18.961 --> 18:23.120
You let him go? For now,
he's been given bail. We had to.

18:23.121 --> 18:25.041
Doesn't mean I think he's innocent.

18:33.201 --> 18:36.281
If you would like to say
a few words, please let me know.

18:37.521 --> 18:41.040
You will, of course,
be a pallbearer.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.040
You can take Albert's place.

18:43.041 --> 18:46.559
I couldn't possibly disturb things
now they've set things up.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.041
Well, nonsense. It's no trouble.
Besides, I'm in uniform.

18:50.042 --> 18:54.481
It wouldn't match. I don't see...
Father, my eulogy, may I ask?

19:09.601 --> 19:13.921
I take your point about uniform.
Excuse me.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.520
It wasn't Colonel Adams. What?!

19:21.521 --> 19:25.680
Lady Felicia just told me,
his back's shot - war wound.

19:25.681 --> 19:28.400
He couldn't carry the coffin.

19:28.401 --> 19:32.119
He couldn't have lifted
and swung that oar. Poppycock!

19:32.120 --> 19:35.881
Look at him, his posture's perfect.
Anyway, he would've told me.

19:36.961 --> 19:40.041
What, and have the whole town know
he wears a girdle?

19:46.361 --> 19:47.800
He's a proud man.

19:47.801 --> 19:51.881
He may be a foolish man but
he could not have killed Anne-Marie.

19:51.882 --> 19:53.841
But then, who did?

20:10.481 --> 20:13.960
"I do declare this day
that I, Anne-Marie Adams,

20:13.961 --> 20:16.761
"being of sound mind..."

20:19.281 --> 20:21.800
Sorry. Sorry, I'm late.

20:21.801 --> 20:25.240
Apologies to all. Mr Higgins.
Father.

20:25.241 --> 20:27.159
What's the priest doing here?

20:27.160 --> 20:29.959
We'll come to that,
it's in the order of business.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.601
We'll start with
a few special clauses.

20:32.602 --> 20:37.440
"Firstly, to my best friend,
Felicia Montague, I leave various

20:37.441 --> 20:42.921
"mementos and trinkets
of sentimental value."

20:43.961 --> 20:45.441
Oh!

20:46.641 --> 20:50.441
"And to my beloved daughter,
Ruby..."

20:57.321 --> 21:01.761
The police returned them this
morning. Those stones are dazzling.

21:01.762 --> 21:06.761
Ah, the Trewlove family heritage.
The flying stars.

21:12.081 --> 21:14.561
Colonel, you asked for tea.

21:18.841 --> 21:24.401
They're so cold. Mum died in them,
I don't want to wear them.

21:25.761 --> 21:28.721
What shall I do with them, then?
Put them in the safe.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.681
They should be locked away.

21:34.161 --> 21:38.801
I'm left some sentimental items,
books and photographs.

21:40.041 --> 21:43.681
The rest of her estate has been left
in its entirety...

21:46.361 --> 21:47.401
to the church.

21:57.361 --> 21:59.840
Most unexpected and very generous.

21:59.841 --> 22:03.760
Did Anne-Marie not leave anything
for her brother?

22:03.761 --> 22:08.880
Well, I don't need her money.
I can't wear her jewels.

22:08.881 --> 22:14.480
Actually, I'm interested in a
different kind of legacy. Her play.

22:14.481 --> 22:18.400
What do you mean?
It was cancelled the day she died.

22:18.401 --> 22:23.640
I want to restage it. Get everybody
on board. Family, friends, servants.

22:23.641 --> 22:26.399
Make it a celebration of Annie's
life. But...

22:26.400 --> 22:28.159
We can't let her killer stop us

22:28.160 --> 22:31.359
performing the last thing
she ever wrote. He's right.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.399
Uncle James, you could take
John's role and, Felicia,

22:34.400 --> 22:35.919
you could stand in for Mum.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.401
It'll be a bit of a scramble
but I think we can make it happen,

22:39.402 --> 22:44.041
by the end of the week?
Saturday, it is.

22:46.841 --> 22:50.359
I don't understand. It's perfect.
Everybody in the house will be

22:50.360 --> 22:53.599
watching so no-one will see.
I'll leave the stage in Act Two

22:53.600 --> 22:56.041
and they won't look for me
till curtain call.

22:56.042 --> 23:01.200
So we're really going to do it?
We're eloping?

23:01.201 --> 23:04.760
If you'll take me
without a penny to my name.

23:04.761 --> 23:06.921
I wouldn't have it any other way.

23:21.681 --> 23:26.200
I have never understood how you
can play chess against yourself.

23:26.201 --> 23:28.040
This is not a game.

23:28.041 --> 23:31.159
Yes, Father, that's what my Frank
used to say about poker.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.481
These are not pieces, these are
suspects. We can discount

23:34.482 --> 23:39.200
the colonel and John Van Ert.
Why the tutor?

23:39.201 --> 23:44.040
He's a Communist. Oh, obviously,
why didn't I think of that?

23:44.041 --> 23:48.600
Communism, Socialism.
It's all Greek to me.

23:48.601 --> 23:51.919
Who wants to socialise with
the working classes anyway?

23:51.920 --> 23:55.401
I don't see the attraction
of spending my nights off with

23:55.402 --> 23:57.960
chimney sweeps and the like.

23:57.961 --> 24:01.359
A Communist doesn't have to go
drinking with chimney sweeps.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.281
He wants the chimney swept
and the sweeps paid.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.761
But he won't allow you
to own your own soot.

24:09.321 --> 24:11.399
From the marks on Anne-Marie's neck,

24:11.400 --> 24:14.519
we know that the murderer
was after her jewels.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.759
But the one thing we know for sure
about John Van Ert

24:17.760 --> 24:20.761
is that he's not interested
in worldly goods.

24:23.201 --> 24:25.961
So, who else is there?

24:28.681 --> 24:32.680
Lady Felicia was at the scene.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.201
And Ruby. Yes.

24:36.201 --> 24:38.961
But neither of them
have sufficient motive.

24:41.561 --> 24:44.041
Which leaves one last possibility.

24:47.201 --> 24:49.680
James.

24:49.681 --> 24:52.279
We know he and his sister fell out
so badly

24:52.280 --> 24:55.761
that they didn't talk to each other
for 20-odd years,

24:55.762 --> 25:01.240
and she cut him out of her will.
There must be real animosity there.

25:01.241 --> 25:03.601
Sure, he wasn't even in the country.

25:03.602 --> 25:07.921
Well,
we only have his word for that.

25:26.841 --> 25:29.240
Boo!

25:29.241 --> 25:32.799
Why are you here? Well, it's not
for the sparkling conversation.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.479
You've got no reason
to be hanging around.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.199
Really, do you reckon?
Cos I hear they've got

25:38.200 --> 25:40.439
this really pretty new parlour maid.
Hmm.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.559
And I just brought
a couple of rabbits.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.241
Just waiting for my one and six.

25:44.242 --> 25:47.720
Earning an honest penny?
Not like you. Mm.

25:47.721 --> 25:50.641
What are you really here for, hmm?

25:53.081 --> 25:55.561
Quick, someone's coming. Kiss me.

25:58.641 --> 26:02.200
Hang on.
You have excuse for why you're here.

26:02.201 --> 26:05.360
Yeah, but it was fun, though,
wasn't it?

26:05.361 --> 26:09.761
Wasn't that Uncle just slipping out?
And up to no good.

26:10.881 --> 26:12.441
Well, that IS interesting.

26:16.161 --> 26:20.160
Susie told me this morning.
She saw James herself?

26:20.161 --> 26:22.600
Bit of gusto, Dad, please?

26:22.601 --> 26:25.481
And Mrs McCarthy rang London Airport
and there WASN'T

26:25.482 --> 26:28.920
a flight from Nairobi
on the morning of the wake.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.279
So what do you think?

26:30.280 --> 26:34.001
I think you're being too suspicious.
He's a decent man.

26:34.002 --> 26:39.320
Interesting, educated -
you should hear him on... the Vatican.

26:39.321 --> 26:42.760
He probably knows as much
about it as you do.

26:42.761 --> 26:47.281
Don't you think that's strange in a
man who spent two decades in Africa?

26:47.282 --> 26:49.961
I think it's commendable.

26:53.161 --> 26:57.200
Help, police,
the safe's been broken into!

26:57.201 --> 26:59.201
Oh, erm, five minutes, Inspector?

27:00.321 --> 27:03.441
Go from seeing the empty safe, Dad.
We need real horror.

27:03.442 --> 27:07.800
Looks who's here. Help, police,
the safe's been broken into!

27:07.801 --> 27:12.159
Excuse me. Much better. Don't raise
your suspicions about James with him.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.641
You'll just make a fool
of yourself.

27:14.642 --> 27:19.240
And when has that ever bothered me?
Father...

27:19.241 --> 27:21.440
I don't know about the flights

27:21.441 --> 27:25.880
but the reason he's been creeping
about at night... is to see me.

27:25.881 --> 27:29.321
Felicia, your cue.
I hope I can rely on your discretion.

27:32.761 --> 27:36.481
As the next scene begins,
the stage is dark.

27:37.721 --> 27:40.641
Police! I know you're in there.
Come out and...

27:40.642 --> 27:42.360
I wouldn't do that.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.519
Keep your hands up where
I can see them.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.239
You! I never thought for a second
it would be you.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.721
I'll take that as a compliment.
You'll never get away with this.

27:52.321 --> 27:54.439
Oh, Felicia,
don't forget the ketchup.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.761
There's a bag for under your
clothes, this needs to look real.

27:57.762 --> 27:59.680
We'll see about that.

27:59.681 --> 28:01.839
Not investigating, I hope, Father.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.641
Let's make the next scene-change
really seamless.

28:04.642 --> 28:08.280
Apparently my spare cassock
has a starring role.

28:08.281 --> 28:10.801
We'll see about that.

28:12.401 --> 28:15.520
James Trewlove
is off the suspect list.

28:15.521 --> 28:19.480
I've already checked him out.
But what about the flights?

28:19.481 --> 28:22.599
He was definitely still in Nairobi
when Anne-Marie died.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.161
I have confirmation
from the Chief of Police.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.160
And how does the Chief of Police
know?

28:28.161 --> 28:30.521
Um... they were having dinner.

28:34.401 --> 28:36.561
How long have you worked here?

28:46.441 --> 28:49.401
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, mm.

28:53.561 --> 28:57.280
When am I next on?
Dad, I've stuck your cues up here.

28:57.281 --> 29:00.201
I put costumes out.
Please, no-one mess up.

29:00.202 --> 29:03.680
Where have these been? Attic.

29:03.681 --> 29:06.599
Some of it dates back as far
as YOUR day, so if it stinks,

29:06.600 --> 29:09.119
you know who to blame.
The hall's filling up,

29:09.120 --> 29:11.521
take your positions.
Is everybody ready?

29:15.361 --> 29:17.960
Amore mio,
mi sto innamorando di te.

29:17.961 --> 29:21.079
That's beautiful.
I wish I knew what it meant.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.519
THAT would be telling.

29:22.520 --> 29:26.361
How did you manage to learn Italian,
anyway? Out in Africa?

29:26.362 --> 29:28.321
Well, that...

29:29.761 --> 29:33.241
would be telling... too!

29:40.641 --> 29:44.561
I suppose I should, or Felicia
will never talk to me again.

29:44.562 --> 29:46.760
How much? A shilling.

29:46.761 --> 29:48.921
Daylight robbery!

29:51.961 --> 29:56.280
No good. Lira. Italian.

29:56.281 --> 29:58.400
Oh, like a bad penny.

29:58.401 --> 30:01.161
I should have left it
where I dropped it by the lake.

30:01.162 --> 30:03.520
You didn't drop THIS one, Father.

30:03.521 --> 30:06.639
I'm collecting Italian coins
for my pilgrimage to Rome.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.041
Well,
the lira never left the presbytery.

30:12.121 --> 30:13.680
Father.

30:13.681 --> 30:17.120
I didn't think theatre
was your thing.

30:17.121 --> 30:20.081
I'm not here for the show.
Not that one, anyway.

30:20.082 --> 30:23.600
We're about to make an arrest.
Who?

30:23.601 --> 30:27.360
Not John?
Not Van Ert, no. He's got an alibi.

30:27.361 --> 30:29.881
When I spoke to Ruby earlier,
she, erm...

30:29.882 --> 30:33.440
vouched for him.

30:33.441 --> 30:37.600
Are you telling me
they were having sex?

30:37.601 --> 30:39.920
I do know what sex is, Inspector.

30:39.921 --> 30:44.560
And she won't be the first girl
who lied for her lover.

30:44.561 --> 30:46.119
So who is your chief suspect?

30:46.120 --> 30:48.641
For once,
we may be singing the same song.

30:48.642 --> 30:52.080
I'm here for Lady Felicia.

30:52.081 --> 30:55.399
When she comes off stage,
I'm taking her in for questioning.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.719
Have you gone...? I've got witnesses
who've seen her at the house

30:58.720 --> 31:02.799
in the small hours. Yes, but...
That gives me clear motive.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.839
Her affair with the colonel,
her best friend's husband.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.719
The Colonel? No, that's not right.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.201
James Trewlove saw them together.
James did?!

31:29.761 --> 31:32.481
Are you sitting comfortably?
Then, we'll begin.

31:35.721 --> 31:39.039
Here's a list of what I need...
Susie, where are James' shoes?

31:39.040 --> 31:42.559
He needs heels with that dress.
I couldn't find any. Feet too big.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.281
He's an eight.
He could squeeze into Annie's.

31:45.282 --> 31:48.120
Not eight. 11. Very big. Huge.

31:48.121 --> 31:51.319
Those shoes you gave to him
for the funeral swamped him.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.439
Shoes I put out were Mr Trewlove's.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.401
Nonsense, James didn't bring
any formal shoes.

31:56.402 --> 31:59.000
Not from suitcase. From attic.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.361
20 years old, yes, but
unless his feet have shrunk...

32:02.362 --> 32:03.401
Here.

32:05.961 --> 32:07.920
See yourself.

32:07.921 --> 32:10.640
'Well, good.
Call me when it's ready.

32:10.641 --> 32:14.961
'Until then, I'll be in my study.
Phew! That was close!'

32:21.641 --> 32:24.881
Cue coming up - where are the heels?
Here.

32:28.481 --> 32:30.241
Those are the best I could do.

32:37.361 --> 32:39.081
No, I'll have to wear mine.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.480
Help! Police!
The safe's been broken into!

32:43.481 --> 32:49.081
And we're on. Come on! Go on!
You're going to be great!

32:52.441 --> 32:56.440
Police!
Oh, you're here! Help, police!

32:56.441 --> 32:59.959
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Put your hands up, don't say a word.

32:59.960 --> 33:04.241
Why would you do this to me?
Didn't you hear me?
I said shut up, or I'll shut you up!

33:04.242 --> 33:07.720
You and anyone trying to help.

33:07.721 --> 33:10.041
I always thought
she was a little actress!

33:10.042 --> 33:13.641
You'll never get away with this.
Help me! Help me!

33:15.201 --> 33:17.081
No!

33:19.721 --> 33:21.521
Isn't she brilliant?!

33:23.721 --> 33:25.920
We'll see about that! Excuse me.

33:25.921 --> 33:29.281
Dad, hadn't you better get changed?
You're on again in five.

33:31.881 --> 33:34.799
I can't believe he'd betray us!
Everything's lost!

33:34.800 --> 33:36.119
My dowry, my future...

33:36.120 --> 33:38.759
Cancel the wedding!
I can hardly get married now!

33:38.760 --> 33:42.479
The safe's been broken into! Er,
Dad... The safe's been broken into!

33:42.480 --> 33:45.039
We've done that scene!
Listen, I'm not acting.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.281
We've been burgled.
The Stars have gone!

33:55.161 --> 33:58.441
Woman in dark clothing came out
the front door and got in a cab.

33:58.442 --> 34:02.080
Which way did she go?
Down the drive.

34:02.081 --> 34:05.361
I'm relying on you
to have overheard where to.

34:12.880 --> 34:16.119
Even if I knew where he was,
do you think I'd hand him over?

34:16.120 --> 34:19.399
He's a thief, Ruby.
Don't you see? He's betrayed you.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.399
He'd never do that.
I hope you never catch him.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.399
Come on, this is ridiculous!
Got him! No, it's not him!

34:25.400 --> 34:28.079
Don't you see -
if I wanted to steal the diamonds,

34:28.080 --> 34:31.081
I could have done! They're mine!
But Van Ert couldn't.

34:31.081 --> 34:32.440
And the Countess?

34:33.440 --> 34:37.841
Well, the fact that she's run
means she's got something to hide.

34:39.281 --> 34:43.559
Solving a theft and a murder in
one day, that's not a bad innings.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.880
Inspector, before he left,
Father ask me to give you message.

34:46.882 --> 34:49.801
He said you must let Lady Felicia go.

34:51.681 --> 34:53.478
What is it with that priest?

34:53.480 --> 34:55.841
I don't turn up on Sundays
to give his sermon!

34:58.321 --> 35:01.001
It's all right, dear.
I haven't caught her yet.

35:05.521 --> 35:08.359
These were upstairs,
packed and ready to go.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.879
Looks like your daughter
was eloping.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.759
We were running away together, yes.
It's not a crime!

35:13.760 --> 35:15.919
I'm sorry, darling,
but it's obvious.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.919
He planned to steal the Stars,
and leave without you.

35:18.920 --> 35:22.161
So, tell me. If you're right,
where are the diamonds now?

35:29.281 --> 35:32.001
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

35:36.601 --> 35:40.041
Excuse me. Excuse me.

35:41.401 --> 35:44.759
On my life, it isn't him.
There must be others without alibis!

35:44.760 --> 35:48.639
All watching the play. Except for
the people in it! All accounted for.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.561
Apart from Felicia. Where's she?

35:51.641 --> 35:54.799
I believe the Countess could kill,
but for love, not money.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.039
I don't believe she'd steal
diamonds. That's not why she ran.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.639
Ran? You think she left?
Well, she's not here.

36:00.640 --> 36:04.399
I was outside waiting for Ruby until
the moment you had me arrested.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.081
Lady Felicia
didn't leave the building. Then...

36:08.321 --> 36:09.761
where is she?

36:18.241 --> 36:20.601
Excuse me. I do beg your pardon.

36:44.761 --> 36:46.640
You won't get away with it.

36:46.641 --> 36:50.000
And if you wanted to pass incognito,

36:50.001 --> 36:52.801
you should really have changed
your shoes.

36:52.802 --> 36:54.560
I'm keeping the diamonds.

36:54.561 --> 36:58.239
Leave the compartment, get off at
the next stop, and nobody gets hurt.

36:58.240 --> 37:02.481
But somebody already has been hurt,
haven't they? You killed Anne-Marie.

37:02.482 --> 37:05.000
That's absurd!

37:05.001 --> 37:06.839
I wasn't even in the country.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.241
And why on earth
would I murder my own sister?

37:09.242 --> 37:12.041
But she WASN'T your sister, was she?

37:14.641 --> 37:18.600
Yours, I believe?
You weren't in Africa.

37:18.601 --> 37:21.839
You were in Italy
before you came to Kembleford,

37:21.840 --> 37:25.159
fought with Anne-Marie Adams
on the day of Ruby's birthday,

37:25.160 --> 37:27.641
and then dropped that coin
in the struggle.

37:27.642 --> 37:30.640
Father,
you have a real talent for fiction.

37:30.641 --> 37:34.601
The photograph was a clever touch.
That had me flummoxed for a while.

37:34.602 --> 37:36.720
How could I possibly fake that?

37:36.721 --> 37:40.440
You didn't.
But your clothes weren't a costume.

37:40.441 --> 37:42.881
They were what you
would have been wearing,

37:42.882 --> 37:45.240
as the nanny's son.

37:45.241 --> 37:48.721
I had it right the first time
we met, didn't I? Mr Short?

37:49.841 --> 37:51.879
It must have been terrible for you,

37:51.880 --> 37:55.519
coming back from the Continent,
discovering your mother had died.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.599
Visiting her grave and finding her
buried like a pauper.

37:58.600 --> 38:02.079
Did you blame Anne-Marie
for her death? This is nonsense!

38:02.080 --> 38:06.041
I suspect you must have thought
the Adamses owed her more than that.

38:06.042 --> 38:08.840
Aged retainers
should be pensioned off,

38:08.841 --> 38:10.959
not thrown out with the rubbish.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.801
But Anne-Marie
couldn't give you a penny. WOULDN'T!

38:13.802 --> 38:20.200
So you decided to take the diamonds.
She fought back and you killed her.

38:20.201 --> 38:23.039
It was an accident.
But it wasn't an accident

38:23.040 --> 38:25.839
when you then decided to stand in
as her brother,

38:25.840 --> 38:28.321
and take
whatever he was set to inherit.

38:28.322 --> 38:32.960
The only person who suspected
anything was Lady Felicia.

38:32.961 --> 38:34.639
I don't know what she spotted,

38:34.640 --> 38:37.441
but when she came on stage,
she called for the police.

38:37.442 --> 38:42.920
Police! Oh, you're here!
Help! Police!

38:42.921 --> 38:46.720
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Put your hands up.

38:46.721 --> 38:49.801
But that can't have been her line.
She WAS the police.

38:49.802 --> 38:52.880
Shut up, or I'll shut you up!

38:52.881 --> 38:56.841
You'll never get away with this.
Help me! Help! Oh!

39:00.321 --> 39:03.279
I only hope that was chloroform
I smelt on your hanky,

39:03.280 --> 39:05.401
and that you
haven't really hurt her.

39:13.441 --> 39:16.681
Is she really hurt? No, please!

39:22.881 --> 39:24.201
Tomato.

39:26.881 --> 39:33.000
I didn't harm Felicia. I just had
to shut her up. As for Anne-Marie...

39:33.001 --> 39:37.640
I didn't mean to hurt her.
She deserved everything she got.

39:37.641 --> 39:42.000
She deserved to die? For not
paying your mother's pension?

39:42.001 --> 39:44.800
Mum worked for them for 45 years!

39:44.801 --> 39:48.200
She brought up
two generations of that family.

39:48.201 --> 39:51.320
They saw more of her
than I ever did!

39:51.321 --> 39:54.120
And then when she got old,

39:54.121 --> 39:57.040
they turned her out without a penny.

39:57.041 --> 40:00.321
That's what killed her.
Anne-Marie's the murderer, not me!

40:00.322 --> 40:02.841
But she didn't have a penny to give.

40:04.441 --> 40:07.561
They were as much paupers
as your mother was.

40:11.081 --> 40:13.640
But... the will, the bequests!

40:13.641 --> 40:17.081
After the diamonds, her estate
was bequeathed to the church.

40:17.082 --> 40:21.521
So we got a rather nice icon,
a Bible, and two rosaries.

40:22.601 --> 40:25.921
The financial value
of the bequest was precisely zero.

40:28.481 --> 40:30.440
Why didn't she just tell me?

40:30.441 --> 40:35.000
You hit a nerve.
And I hear she had been drinking.

40:35.001 --> 40:38.681
She was plastered. I just wanted
the money Mum was owed.

40:39.721 --> 40:42.840
Enough for a proper gravestone,
for a start.

40:42.841 --> 40:46.360
You will give me what she is owed!

40:46.361 --> 40:49.561
You think you can tell me what to do,
but you can't!

40:49.562 --> 40:52.841
If you won't give it to me,
I'll take it!

40:55.641 --> 40:57.680
Leave me alone!

40:57.681 --> 40:59.601
I won't put up with this!

41:16.681 --> 41:18.801
Why didn't you go in,
try to save her?

41:20.481 --> 41:23.321
I can't swim.

41:25.321 --> 41:28.681
Yes, I was angry,
but I didn't want her dead.

41:31.801 --> 41:33.281
I loved her.

41:35.241 --> 41:38.241
Give me the diamonds.
I'll return them to Ruby.

41:38.242 --> 41:44.840
As for Anne-Marie... give
yourself up, pay for your crimes.

41:44.841 --> 41:48.800
You mean hang.
No, it's manslaughter, not murder.

41:48.801 --> 41:50.560
It'll mean prison,

41:50.561 --> 41:54.121
but you'll give the father
and the daughter justice.

41:55.801 --> 41:57.961
I suppose I don't have much choice.

41:57.962 --> 42:00.961
Better to give yourself up.
Come quietly.

42:07.161 --> 42:08.481
Afternoon.

42:14.001 --> 42:15.921
Let me help you with the clasp.

42:23.161 --> 42:25.401
What are you waiting for?!

43:09.321 --> 43:11.360
Why didn't you stop him?

43:11.361 --> 43:13.519
You're always trying
to save their souls.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.999
He lost his when he ran. You were
trying to take him to the police.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.321
And so Ruby could get her
inheritance back.

43:21.601 --> 43:22.999
Oh, any idiot could see

43:23.000 --> 43:26.041
your precious Flying Stars
were as fake as HE was.

43:36.401 --> 43:37.841
You heard about Uncle...

43:39.361 --> 43:40.841
about the impostor?

43:42.681 --> 43:44.000
Mmm.

43:44.001 --> 43:46.561
Shouldn't be sad, should I?
But, somehow...

43:49.081 --> 43:52.279
I guess the good news is,
I still have an uncle.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.201
Even if he IS still in Nairobi.

43:56.601 --> 43:59.560
Dad, please, don't look like that!

43:59.561 --> 44:02.801
I'm sorry I was running away.
I didn't think I had a choice.

44:02.802 --> 44:04.161
It's not just that.

44:06.401 --> 44:07.801
We're in debt.

44:09.441 --> 44:10.721
Up to our eyeballs.

44:12.161 --> 44:14.880
This place is about to be
repossessed.

44:14.881 --> 44:16.201
Why didn't you tell me?

44:17.361 --> 44:19.641
I'll sell the Stars
when they find them.

44:20.801 --> 44:24.720
They're crushed to dust.
Diamonds don't crumble. No.

44:24.721 --> 44:26.921
But paste does.

44:28.641 --> 44:30.401
I might as well tell you now.

44:31.801 --> 44:33.761
I put the Stars in hock
ten years ago.

44:35.801 --> 44:38.401
The necklace your mum left you
was a good copy.

44:39.881 --> 44:42.120
But paste, nonetheless.

44:42.121 --> 44:44.841
I-I don't understand.
If you're in that much debt,

44:44.842 --> 44:47.760
how could you ever hope
to pay it off?

44:47.761 --> 44:49.521
Only by your marrying well.

44:52.161 --> 44:55.520
I wasn't against John
because he's a tutor,

44:55.521 --> 44:57.641
or even because he's a Communist.

45:00.761 --> 45:02.521
But he can't provide for you.

45:03.721 --> 45:04.761
And nor can I.

45:07.201 --> 45:09.721
So what choice is there?

45:35.321 --> 45:37.521
You SHOULD be celebrating.

45:39.881 --> 45:41.601
Being taken for a fool?

45:42.841 --> 45:44.201
Losing my daughter?

45:45.361 --> 45:48.321
Having to admit
we're close to losing our home?

45:48.322 --> 45:51.800
Gaining freedom. Sorry?
Perhaps the truth is,

45:51.801 --> 45:56.400
this house is a burden to the
next generation, not a legacy.

45:56.401 --> 46:00.759
Do you want to weigh your daughter
down as you've been your whole life?

46:00.760 --> 46:03.081
And of course,
you have another gain.

46:04.801 --> 46:07.199
A son-in-law.
He's not a gold-digger.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.559
He would have taken her
with nothing.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.359
I suppose you want my blessing,

46:11.360 --> 46:13.959
so you can marry them?
Oh, I'll marry them

46:13.960 --> 46:16.039
with your blessing or without it.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.079
But why go all the way
to Gretna Green

46:18.080 --> 46:20.641
when we have a perfectly good church
here?

46:21.681 --> 46:24.041
Come on, Colonel - what do you say?

46:42.041 --> 46:44.081
Nice catch.

46:50.641 --> 46:55.761
Beautiful day for it.
Reminds me of MY wedding day. Oh!

46:56.761 --> 46:58.601
Such a shame.

47:01.921 --> 47:04.321
Why do I always pick the wrong 'uns?

47:06.561 --> 47:11.121
So... spill the beans! Who's that?

47:16.001 --> 47:18.360
That's the REAL Uncle James.

47:18.361 --> 47:19.961
Ooh!

47:21.201 --> 47:22.761
Excuse me. Excuse me.

47:37.363 --> 48:18.944
