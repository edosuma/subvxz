<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-Who's he?

00:04.079 --> 00:05.671
-My former stepson Jake.
-No, if you cared for me,

00:05.748 --> 00:06.997
<i> -you would've stayed in touch.</i>
<i> -CONRAD: Chastain's been sold.</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:08.623
The plan is to turn it
into condos.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.175
Are you on any medication
right now?

00:10.252 --> 00:12.085
-Yes. Ativan.
-You're in withdrawal.

00:12.162 --> 00:13.053
-No, don't call the cops!
-Hey, hey!

00:16.208 --> 00:17.850
<i> -DEVON: What happened?</i>
<i> -MINA: She was stabbed.</i>

00:17.926 --> 00:20.427
NIC:
Baby?

00:20.504 --> 00:22.187
Looks like
your granddaughter's alive.

00:22.264 --> 00:24.431
-(laughs)
<i> -BELL: We need to get Nic</i>

00:24.508 --> 00:25.766
to a functioning hospital.

00:25.842 --> 00:27.517
<i> KIT:</i>
<i> Since Randall is governor now,</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:30.270
is there any chance the county
would take over the hospital?

00:30.347 --> 00:32.355
<i> DEVON:</i>
<i> They got the governor</i>
<i> to agree to make Chastain</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:34.533
a public hospital and the staff
will return immediately.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.496
(monitor beeping steadily)

00:41.525 --> 00:43.375
(exhales)

00:47.456 --> 00:49.214
(grunts softly)

00:49.291 --> 00:50.966
Nic.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.385
You're still at Chastain.

00:53.462 --> 00:57.222
It's morning. You're okay.

00:59.134 --> 01:02.010
How's the baby?

01:02.087 --> 01:06.065
Well, we heard the heartbeat,
remember?

01:06.141 --> 01:07.474
Saw the ultrasound.

01:07.551 --> 01:09.684
So she's safe.

01:09.761 --> 01:12.237
No, we still haven't
ruled out any complications

01:12.314 --> 01:14.239
that could've happened
from the attack.

01:14.316 --> 01:18.151
You're right,
but it's been two weeks, so...

01:18.228 --> 01:21.404
So far, so good.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.323
Seems like our baby is strong,
like her mom.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.242
(scoffs)

01:25.252 --> 01:27.369
Can't even make it through
the night without...

01:27.445 --> 01:29.129
Nightmares. I know.

01:30.740 --> 01:33.133
They're getting worse.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.261
I dread going to sleep.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.381
We could try
some different meds.

01:39.457 --> 01:41.591
No, I want off the sleep meds.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.769
Okay, I get that.

01:48.183 --> 01:52.185
Nic, I also think you should
see a good therapist.

01:52.262 --> 01:54.896
Sure. Fine.

01:54.973 --> 01:57.691
But you know there's only
one person I want to see.

01:57.767 --> 02:00.119
You know that. You agreed to it.

02:00.195 --> 02:02.404
Yeah, of course.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.206
Whatever you need.

-You back up.

02:33.061 --> 02:34.436
This is my parking spot.

02:34.512 --> 02:36.313
I don't see a name.
There's no number.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.898
We got here at the same time.

02:37.974 --> 02:39.324
You see,
it's reserved for doctors.

02:39.401 --> 02:40.826
What are you,
a second-year resident?

02:40.903 --> 02:42.161
Maybe third?

02:42.237 --> 02:44.321
Internal medicine?
It's pretty obvious.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.207
Particularly given
your bougie entitlement.

02:48.485 --> 02:50.169
Okay, here's the deal:
if you don't back your car up,

02:50.245 --> 02:52.462
I'm gonna call security
and they're gonna tow it.

02:53.698 --> 02:55.415
Oh, don't you dare key my car...

02:55.492 --> 02:57.250
Want your special spot, Doctor?

02:57.327 --> 02:59.261
Go park mine somewhere else.

03:00.589 --> 03:02.756
Oh, and leave the keys
in Nic Nevin's room.

03:02.832 --> 03:04.099
That's where I'll be.

03:08.171 --> 03:11.139
-Pravesh. Good morning.
-Good morning.

03:11.216 --> 03:13.192
Yo, some demented friend
of Nic's

03:13.268 --> 03:15.435
actually expected me
to park her car.

03:15.512 --> 03:16.645
Word? She tip you?

03:16.721 --> 03:18.313
You know,
valets make bank on tips.

03:18.390 --> 03:19.439
(both chuckle)

03:19.516 --> 03:21.524
Your first day
at the new Chastain, huh?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.193
Yeah. I mean, it doesn't
really look any different

03:23.204 --> 03:24.653
as a public hospital, though.

03:24.729 --> 03:26.029
Oh, believe me, brother,
it's different.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.198
Brace yourself
for some growing pains.

03:28.209 --> 03:31.043
An open door means
a lot more patients

03:31.119 --> 03:33.370
and a lot less money
to care for them.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.205
We turn no one away,

03:35.216 --> 03:37.374
even though our resources
are stretched thin.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.833
Yeah, I know it all too well.

03:38.910 --> 03:41.253
Happened to my father.

03:41.329 --> 03:44.047
He died alone in
a public hospital, overlooked.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.892
If it was private,
he might have lived.

03:46.969 --> 03:49.552
Well, we gonna fight to make
sure that doesn't happen here,

03:49.563 --> 03:52.022
-my man.
-Yeah.

03:54.476 --> 03:55.892
(sighs)

03:55.903 --> 03:57.402
(wheels squeaking)

03:59.097 --> 04:02.148
Whoa. Dr. Feldman versus
a squeaky wheel.

04:02.225 --> 04:03.858
My money's on Feldman all day.

04:03.935 --> 04:05.735
Thank you.
It's not just the wheel.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.529
We'll be lucky
if we can get it to turn on.

04:07.605 --> 04:09.656
Red Rock sold
most of our equipment.

04:09.733 --> 04:13.085
Our EKG machines
are now ancient and we...

04:14.496 --> 04:17.080
Oh, my God.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.083
-You know her?
-Unfortunately, yes.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.260
Although she looks
a lot different

04:21.336 --> 04:23.044
than the last time I saw her.

04:23.121 --> 04:24.972
Less train wreck, more...

04:26.100 --> 04:27.766
...wow.

04:27.843 --> 04:30.385
-Train wreck. Really?
-Mm-hmm.

04:30.462 --> 04:33.430
Didn't think
we'd ever see you here again.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.889
Didn't think
I'd ever be here again.

04:34.966 --> 04:36.558
I'm visiting Nic.

04:36.634 --> 04:38.277
Oh, so you're the one
who got under Devon's skin.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.154
(laughs)
Here you go.

04:41.598 --> 04:43.690
Nic is in 521.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.535
Your car is in
the impound lot on Peachtree.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.406
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

04:51.483 --> 04:54.951
-What's her deal?
-Billie Sutton.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.579
Most promising neurosurgery
resident at Chastain.

04:57.655 --> 05:02.417
Or was, until she wrecked one of
Conrad's patients and got fired.

05:02.494 --> 05:04.044
-How'd she do that?
-Hubris, basically.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.470
It was over three years ago.

05:05.547 --> 05:07.255
Wow, that sounds bad.

05:07.332 --> 05:08.798
-It was messy.
-Mm.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.059
-All right.
-See you.

05:14.556 --> 05:17.232
-Ah. I fixed it.
-(elevator bell dings)

05:19.636 --> 05:21.394
NOLAN:
We keep him on fluids.

05:21.471 --> 05:23.063
He's stable, we should be...

05:23.139 --> 05:24.531
Oh, my God.

05:26.476 --> 05:28.234
-Here we go.
-JESSICA: Easy, Conrad.

05:28.311 --> 05:31.154
People change.
Three years is a long time.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.414
Not long enough.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.451
Hawkins.

05:36.528 --> 05:37.994
Sutton.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.163
I bet you're thrilled to see me.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.456
Mm, Nic wants you here,
so I want you here.

05:41.533 --> 05:42.841
Then we won't have trouble.

05:42.918 --> 05:44.968
Not from my end, we won't.

05:46.162 --> 05:48.838
Let's stick to the only thing
that matters.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.340
How is Nic?

05:50.351 --> 05:53.259
The attack nearly killed her
and the baby.

05:53.336 --> 05:55.187
Physically, she's on the mend.

05:55.263 --> 05:57.856
Mentally, each day's
a little worse.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.975
She has PTSD,
keeps reliving what happened

06:01.052 --> 06:03.353
and she's having nightmares.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.939
I sleep in her room.

06:06.015 --> 06:07.649
She wakes up crying.

06:07.725 --> 06:09.868
I'm so sorry it took me
this long to get here.

06:09.945 --> 06:12.371
Where have you been?

06:12.447 --> 06:15.040
You weren't at the wedding.
You never even called her.

06:15.117 --> 06:16.950
-Nic was heartbroken.
-I'll explain what happened

06:17.026 --> 06:18.368
when I see her.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.994
You know, maybe for the moment,
we can put aside

06:20.071 --> 06:21.546
all our triggers
and just be on the same side.

06:21.623 --> 06:24.216
You and I will never be
on the same side.

06:24.292 --> 06:26.051
I have worked the last
three years on my issues.

06:26.128 --> 06:28.553
Your issues?

06:31.466 --> 06:33.508
You wrecked a young man's life.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.510
It was my patient

06:35.587 --> 06:37.637
and you cut unsupervised.
You had no right.

06:37.714 --> 06:39.731
So we're going there. Okay.

06:39.808 --> 06:41.566
What I did was wrong.

06:41.643 --> 06:44.394
But I believed I was acting
in the patient's best interest.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.229
-You got me fired.
-No, I didn't,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.231
and you were playing God.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.233
A fifth-year resident does not
operate unsupervised, period.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.412
-Even you.
-I made a judgment call.
It was bad judgement.

06:53.488 --> 06:55.414
I broke the rules.
I was young and stupid.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.991
No one breaks
more rules than you.

06:58.067 --> 07:00.034
Yeah, I break the rules
when I have to,

07:00.111 --> 07:01.244
when there's
no other alternative,

07:01.255 --> 07:02.587
and only to save lives.

07:02.664 --> 07:04.464
Annabeth Higgins.

07:07.118 --> 07:09.094
The child
your incompetence killed.

07:09.171 --> 07:12.013
Are you done? Because I am.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.976
We're all human.
We all make mistakes.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.888
I have spent
the last three years

07:19.964 --> 07:21.514
with Partners In Health
in Syria,

07:21.591 --> 07:23.608
pulling bullets out of babies,
doing every kind

07:23.685 --> 07:26.186
of emergency surgery
that exists.

07:26.262 --> 07:27.520
Penance is my middle name.

07:27.597 --> 07:29.614
Nic is vulnerable.
She can't handle any drama.

07:29.691 --> 07:31.366
She won't get any from me.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.791
Fine.

07:39.868 --> 07:41.409
Steer clear of me,
try and give Nic what she needs

07:41.486 --> 07:43.962
and then leave,
as soon as possible.

07:47.283 --> 07:49.375
Hello.

07:49.452 --> 07:51.211
Billie.
(laughs)

07:51.287 --> 07:52.045
Nevin.

07:52.121 --> 07:55.474
You look amazing. Oh.

07:55.550 --> 07:58.143
So good to see you.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.136
Mm. Let's see the ring.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.471
(both laugh)

08:01.482 --> 08:03.982
Oh. Look at that rock.

08:04.059 --> 08:06.059
He did good.

08:06.135 --> 08:08.487
Mm. We missed you
at the wedding.

08:08.563 --> 08:11.981
Long story.
I wanted to be there.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.150
But I'm here now.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.994
And I'll be staying
right by your side

08:16.071 --> 08:17.237
-as long as you need me.
-(exhales)

08:17.313 --> 08:18.821
I don't care how long it takes.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.999
Days or weeks.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.912
Honey, go.

08:25.989 --> 08:27.339
Your patients need you.

08:27.415 --> 08:28.507
Chastain needs help
with this transition.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.124
BILLIE:
Yeah, go.

08:30.201 --> 08:31.384
I've got Nic.

08:32.587 --> 08:34.304
Trust me.

08:35.665 --> 08:38.016
♪

08:52.181 --> 08:53.940
Hey.

08:54.017 --> 08:55.441
The board is interviewing
doctors today

08:55.518 --> 08:57.035
for the new CEO position.

08:57.112 --> 08:58.370
Yeah, they're talking
to everybody.

08:58.446 --> 08:59.445
I declined.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.489
Not everybody. Not me.

09:01.566 --> 09:03.533
You don't want
that thankless job, do you?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.536
We are deep in the hole
but the situation is fixable.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.047
I shouldn't be excluded
from providing solutions

09:09.124 --> 09:11.499
simply because I lack a penis.

09:11.576 --> 09:14.052
-Wow, no women
are being interviewed?
-Nope.

09:14.129 --> 09:15.887
I wish Mina was here.

09:15.964 --> 09:18.131
She'd have some choice words
and a few elbows to throw.

09:18.207 --> 09:21.509
-Where is she?
-Meeting with
immigration lawyers.

09:21.586 --> 09:23.562
She has to find the best.
I can't lose her.

09:23.638 --> 09:25.397
Neither can Chastain.

09:25.473 --> 09:27.232
Dr. Lamas. Where are you going?

09:27.309 --> 09:28.641
L.A. I fly out tonight.

09:28.718 --> 09:30.351
KIT:
But you can't. We have

09:30.428 --> 09:31.894
a bilateral hand transplant
this afternoon.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.563
I get paid per procedure.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.399
Can't work at a public hospital
on a fixed salary.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.401
I'd make peanuts.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.652
Come on, man. It's not peanuts.

09:39.729 --> 09:41.246
The salary is fair.

09:41.323 --> 09:42.914
Is it north of two million?

09:42.991 --> 09:44.324
KIT:
Fine. Go.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.326
But you have to do
Andy's surgery first.

09:46.402 --> 09:49.162
We have donor hands
he's waited months to get.

09:49.238 --> 09:52.215
Sorry, guys. Cedars-Sinai
is expecting me this week.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.047
That's the fifth surgeon
we've lost.

09:59.123 --> 10:00.923
There'll be more.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.051
First things first.

10:03.127 --> 10:06.012
Those donor hands will be
diverted to another child

10:06.089 --> 10:07.388
if we don't find
a plastic surgeon

10:07.465 --> 10:09.482
to replace Lamas
in the next few hours.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.279
Do I look more important today?

10:14.356 --> 10:16.439
-Should you?
-Yeah, the board needed a leader

10:16.450 --> 10:18.283
for the ER transitional team
and you're looking at him.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.443
Oh, good luck.
Have you seen the waiting room?

10:20.454 --> 10:22.454
Yeah. We need to see
as many patients as we can

10:22.530 --> 10:24.623
as fast as we can.
15 minutes each.

10:24.699 --> 10:26.958
-What if I need longer?
-Talk faster.

10:29.487 --> 10:31.287
(Nic and Billie laugh)

10:31.298 --> 10:34.374
-I really have missed a lot.
-Yep, we have chickens.

10:34.450 --> 10:37.135
The things we do for love.
(chuckles)

10:37.212 --> 10:39.045
What about you?
What's been going on?

10:39.122 --> 10:40.588
I mean, you look better
than ever.

10:40.665 --> 10:43.383
No, this is just armor.

10:43.459 --> 10:45.093
You know,
given how things ended here,

10:45.169 --> 10:47.595
-I had to put on my best face.
-Mm-hmm.

10:47.672 --> 10:50.223
Have you gotten any residency?

10:50.299 --> 10:51.474
No.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.193
I have no prospects yet.

10:54.562 --> 10:55.978
Well, don't stop looking.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.271
You can't waste all that talent.

10:57.348 --> 10:58.439
Let's talk about you.

10:58.516 --> 10:59.991
Looks like your physical

11:00.068 --> 11:01.401
recovery is right on track.

11:01.477 --> 11:02.568
But you're still in that bed.

11:02.645 --> 11:04.153
Movement is medicine.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.497
I've heard you say that
a million times.

11:05.573 --> 11:07.999
Yeah, I just can't.

11:08.651 --> 11:10.377
Okay, no pressure.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.663
How long since you've left
this room?

11:13.674 --> 11:16.457
I haven't.

11:16.534 --> 11:19.094
Let's get you some fresh air.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.636
-Is it time to get my new hands?
-KIT: Soon, honey.

11:28.713 --> 11:30.972
I'm here to introduce you
to your vascular surgeon,

11:31.048 --> 11:32.682
-Dr. Austin.
-Hey.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.100
Is he an all-star?

11:34.177 --> 11:35.685
I promised Andy I'd recruit

11:35.696 --> 11:37.937
an all-star surgical team
for his hand transplant.

11:38.014 --> 11:40.481
AUSTIN:
Ah, well, Andy, you are in luck.

11:40.558 --> 11:42.483
I happen to be the all-star
of all-stars.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.985
Like Freddie Freeman?

11:44.061 --> 11:45.486
He's a four time all-star,
you know?

11:45.563 --> 11:47.539
And a Golden Glove
first baseman, too, you know?

11:47.615 --> 11:49.207
Just like me one day.

11:49.284 --> 11:52.034
Mom already bought me
a baseball mitt.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.120
Ah, nothing like
the smell of a new glove.

11:54.197 --> 11:56.047
And he hasn't stopped
smelling it.

11:56.124 --> 11:58.332
Well, wait
till you can feel it, Andy.

11:58.409 --> 11:59.709
I can't wait.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.095
So when's my surgery?

12:02.964 --> 12:04.672
Is there a problem?

12:04.749 --> 12:08.059
We have a slight delay--
we lost our plastic surgeon.

12:08.136 --> 12:10.562
DENISE:
But you finally found him
donor hands.

12:10.638 --> 12:12.230
We can't lose them.

12:12.307 --> 12:14.441
KIT:
We'll find someone even better.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.649
Uh-oh.

12:23.726 --> 12:25.026
Is that...?

12:25.102 --> 12:26.486
BILLIE:
Dr. Aronson.

12:26.562 --> 12:29.322
The new Chastain keeps
incompetent surgeons on staff?

12:29.398 --> 12:31.073
We're shorthanded
in neurosurgery.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.701
Top doctors don't like the fixed
salaries of public hospitals.

12:33.736 --> 12:36.421
And so, yeah,
Dr. Aronson is filling in.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.549
Oh, look
what the cat dragged in.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.261
NIC:
That was some
high-level restraint.

12:43.338 --> 12:45.546
Self-help books, meditation,

12:45.623 --> 12:47.882
a shrink, anger management,
hypnosis.

12:47.959 --> 12:50.268
If you told me you had
a magic bean, I'd eat it.

12:50.345 --> 12:52.094
-(chuckles)
-That said, it's a journey,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.429
and I'm nowhere near
the destination.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.482
Billie, stop.

12:56.259 --> 12:58.610
-Oh, God! I just felt the...
-Hey.

12:58.686 --> 13:01.229
-Okay, talk to me.
-Oh, my God,
I just had this pain.

13:01.305 --> 13:03.898
-Where does it hurt?
-What are you doing? She's not
supposed to be out of her room.

13:03.975 --> 13:06.526
The baby. Something's wrong. I-I
just felt, I felt this pain...

13:06.602 --> 13:08.611
Okay, okay, I'm sure
everything's fine, but let's get

13:08.622 --> 13:10.196
that pain checked out and we'll

13:10.273 --> 13:11.790
do another ultrasound
just to be okay.

13:11.866 --> 13:14.083
Hang on.

13:26.664 --> 13:28.973
-That's extra fluid.
-Yes.

13:29.050 --> 13:30.341
See, I knew
something felt different.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.134
The heart's beating.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.978
TECH:
The baby is alive and moving.

13:34.055 --> 13:35.480
But there's extra fluid
around the heart.

13:36.632 --> 13:38.307
CONRAD:
That can have many causes.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.984
Some of them benign.

13:41.729 --> 13:43.988
Hey.

13:44.065 --> 13:45.898
It's gonna be okay.

13:45.975 --> 13:48.401
(scoffs, sniffles)

13:48.477 --> 13:51.404
CONRAD:
We just need to find out
what's going on.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.498
NIC:
Yeah.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.410
I'm gonna go talk to Nic's OB.

13:57.486 --> 13:59.036
You up to speed?

13:59.113 --> 14:00.621
Yes, uh, but before you go,

14:00.698 --> 14:03.007
I have some ideas
about what's going on.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.668
Okay.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.087
Um, time for some boundaries.

14:08.164 --> 14:09.681
You're not her doctor.

14:09.757 --> 14:13.175
And you don't work here anymore.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.352
I want to help.

14:14.429 --> 14:16.304
Good.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.014
Go talk to Nic.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.066
I'll handle the medicine.

14:21.010 --> 14:22.935
Two heads are better than one.

14:23.012 --> 14:24.687
I'm gonna say this once.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.522
Don't make
the same mistake again.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.199
Just be Nic's friend.

14:28.276 --> 14:30.318
And try and keep your ego
out of this.

14:30.394 --> 14:31.995
Okay?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.158
Labs are pristine.

14:37.234 --> 14:38.659
Vascular imaging looks good.

14:38.736 --> 14:40.328
Our little guy is ready to go.

14:40.404 --> 14:42.163
We just need plastics.

14:42.239 --> 14:43.372
AUSTIN:
I've called around
to every hospital

14:43.383 --> 14:44.624
in driving distance.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.875
No one has the skill set

14:45.886 --> 14:47.376
for a double hand replacement.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.629
I mean, it's
the highest level of surgery.

14:49.705 --> 14:52.265
I might have someone.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.395
Dr. Jake Wong.

14:57.472 --> 14:58.971
My former stepson.

14:59.048 --> 15:01.182
KIT:
I know Jake's in plastics,

15:01.258 --> 15:03.142
but has he done
a bilateral transplant?

15:03.219 --> 15:05.019
In Guatemala, four years ago.

15:05.096 --> 15:05.978
Four years?

15:06.055 --> 15:08.022
I'm sure best practices

15:08.099 --> 15:09.649
has changed considerably
since then.

15:09.725 --> 15:11.242
Well, best practices may have
to give way

15:11.319 --> 15:13.202
to best available
on short notice.

15:16.065 --> 15:18.416
Your last exchange with him
did not go well.

15:18.493 --> 15:20.952
Yeah, but this,
this isn't personal-- it's work.

15:21.028 --> 15:23.162
And it's a hell
of an interesting case.

15:23.239 --> 15:26.165
I'm just, I'm-I'm betting
that Jake won't let

15:26.242 --> 15:28.426
his resentment of me
stand in the way.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.431
Then go, get him to commit.

15:33.508 --> 15:36.768
We only have a few hours
before we lose the donor hands.

15:36.844 --> 15:39.062
Okay.

15:44.260 --> 15:46.268
DEVON:
We've all left
the stove on before.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.062
It's the second time this week.

15:48.139 --> 15:49.605
Third, but who's counting?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.691
I could have burned
the house down.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.693
Age, dear.
We're all in the same boat.

15:53.769 --> 15:55.453
No. I'm dangerous.

15:55.530 --> 15:57.738
Has Norman been
seen here before?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.532
No. It was a different hospital.

15:59.608 --> 16:01.784
But the doctor said
the diagnosis was clear.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.536
Alzheimer's.

16:03.612 --> 16:06.631
With this disease, it's the
caregiver that has it the worst.

16:06.708 --> 16:09.092
I'm worried about her.

16:10.161 --> 16:11.302
Why don't you just put me

16:11.379 --> 16:13.587
away somewhere?
Don't go through this hell.

16:13.664 --> 16:16.224
Hell would be
living without you.

16:19.462 --> 16:21.470
-What's this?
-A fall.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.223
Happens a lot. Usually at night.
He gets up in the dark.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.100
Won't stay in bed.

16:26.177 --> 16:27.560
Prostate issues.

16:27.636 --> 16:29.395
I have to pee all the time.

16:29.472 --> 16:31.439
I'd like to do
a comprehensive physical exam.

16:31.515 --> 16:33.992
Balance issues can mean
other problems.

16:34.068 --> 16:36.369
And a lot of these conditions
mimic Alzheimer's.

16:39.648 --> 16:42.166
(monitor beeping rapidly)

16:42.243 --> 16:43.909
All right, stay here,
you're not going anywhere.

16:43.986 --> 16:47.130
I'll be right back, okay?

16:48.508 --> 16:51.834
Look, I'm sorry I didn't come
to the wedding.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.845
I missed having you there.

16:53.921 --> 16:55.629
I knew it would be packed
with Chastain people.

16:55.706 --> 16:58.683
Just not the best crowd for me.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.343
And given
my history with Conrad,

17:01.354 --> 17:03.596
the fact that he basically
can't stand me...

17:03.672 --> 17:05.264
(chuckles)

17:05.341 --> 17:07.433
...I didn't want to spoil
your perfect day.

17:07.510 --> 17:11.029
But it was harder
than you might think.

17:11.105 --> 17:13.147
And I wanted to see you
in your dress.

17:13.224 --> 17:15.324
Watch the first dance.

17:18.229 --> 17:20.872
I know that this is
your worst nightmare.

17:20.948 --> 17:22.206
You don't want
to be the patient.

17:22.283 --> 17:24.617
You want to take care
of patients.

17:24.693 --> 17:27.453
I mean, what kind of nurse am I
if I can't even save

17:27.530 --> 17:30.089
my own baby, right?

17:31.534 --> 17:33.384
(Nic sighs)

17:33.461 --> 17:36.262
What is it?

17:37.799 --> 17:40.224
It's just I already
bought a crib.

17:42.470 --> 17:45.063
I lose this baby, I...

17:46.382 --> 17:48.066
...I can't help but think
that everything's

17:48.142 --> 17:50.142
just gonna come crashing down.

17:50.219 --> 17:52.394
No.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.031
I'm here to catch you, Nic.

18:01.397 --> 18:04.582
See the fluid in the abdomen
and around the heart?

18:04.659 --> 18:07.201
Your baby has severe anemia.

18:07.278 --> 18:08.994
How did we miss this?

18:09.071 --> 18:10.254
We couldn't have known.

18:10.331 --> 18:12.373
Nic's prenatal tests were
all normal.

18:12.449 --> 18:14.583
But she must have an antibody
that's crossing the placenta

18:14.594 --> 18:16.502
and attacking
the baby's red blood cells.

18:16.579 --> 18:20.223
Where did it come from?
Where did it come from?

18:22.084 --> 18:23.259
The blood transfusions.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.427
She had so many
after the attack.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.013
They must have triggered
the reaction.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.890
Conrad, you know
what we have to do next.

18:29.967 --> 18:31.725
Another transfusion.

18:31.802 --> 18:34.520
Yes. The baby needs an
intrauterine blood transfusion.

18:34.597 --> 18:36.355
Without it,

18:36.432 --> 18:38.357
she won't survive.

18:38.434 --> 18:40.118
If we do this,

18:40.194 --> 18:42.403
there's a high chance
of miscarriage.

18:42.479 --> 18:44.163
That can't happen.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.127
I'm not sure
Nic could take that.

18:51.155 --> 18:53.965
No, I'm not sure
I could take that.

18:59.213 --> 19:00.713
-(phone ringing)
-This is Dr. Wong.

19:00.789 --> 19:02.089
<i> Hey, Jake. It's Randolph.</i>

19:02.166 --> 19:04.049
I need your help as a doctor.

19:04.126 --> 19:06.135
<i> You want a little freshening u?</i>
<i> Neck lift?</i>

19:06.146 --> 19:08.387
<i> Rhinoplasty?</i>
<i> 'Cause I don't do that.</i>

19:08.464 --> 19:11.265
I do reconstructive,
medically necessary.

19:11.342 --> 19:13.058
There's a boy who needs

19:13.135 --> 19:15.144
a bilateral
hand transplant today.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.230
<i> And Chastain just lost our best</i>
<i> plastic surgeon. He's the only</i>

19:18.307 --> 19:20.399
one in Atlanta who's done
a hand transplant before.

19:20.476 --> 19:22.985
Except... except for you.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.830
<i> Without you, the kid is gonna</i>
<i> lose his place in line.</i>

19:25.907 --> 19:28.324
And he may wait years
for another set of hands.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.127
I'm on my way. I'll text you
when I'm out front.

19:38.702 --> 19:41.095
(mouthing)

19:44.375 --> 19:45.674
Gentlemen,

19:45.685 --> 19:48.352
Governor Randall,
sorry to interrupt

19:48.429 --> 19:50.304
your CEO interviews, but

19:50.381 --> 19:52.857
there's a time-sensitive issue.
We have a boy

19:52.934 --> 19:55.517
awaiting a hand transplant
and I need emergency privileges

19:55.528 --> 19:58.520
-for an outside surgeon.
-Surely there's someone
already here...

19:58.531 --> 20:00.940
The only doctor qualified
for this rare surgery

20:01.016 --> 20:03.025
quit because we've gone public.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.861
Look, Chastain can't take a risk

20:05.872 --> 20:08.197
on an unknown surgeon
for a rare, high-risk surgery.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.784
Well, I can promise
we will fail if we don't try.

20:11.860 --> 20:14.328
Don't we have a mandate to make

20:14.405 --> 20:17.798
Chastain a hospital that
goes any distance for patients?

20:22.037 --> 20:23.629
I will sign off
on your new surgeon.

20:23.706 --> 20:25.839
If this goes wrong...

20:25.916 --> 20:28.100
it's on you.

20:29.470 --> 20:32.972
Considering where you sit,
and what you've achieved,

20:33.048 --> 20:34.682
why are no women

20:34.758 --> 20:37.068
being interviewed
for the CEO position?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.988
Isn't that on you?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.868
Hey, where are you two going?
I didn't discharge you.

20:54.945 --> 20:56.254
Dr. Feldman did.

20:56.330 --> 20:58.330
-He did what?
-Well, you treated the burn

20:58.407 --> 21:00.874
and he gave us
some gauze to take home.

21:00.951 --> 21:02.501
Your feet are dragging.

21:02.578 --> 21:04.929
So the falls may not just
be because of balance.

21:05.006 --> 21:06.005
Are you having trouble walking?

21:06.081 --> 21:08.132
It's old age. What can you do?

21:08.208 --> 21:10.384
It's quite all right, dear.
We don't want to be a bother.

21:10.461 --> 21:13.012
And I don't want Norman
to suffer if he doesn't have to.

21:13.088 --> 21:15.106
Okay, the symptoms that
I'm seeing make me think this is

21:15.182 --> 21:16.983
not Alzheimer's at all.

21:18.260 --> 21:20.945
I'd like to do a spinal tap.

21:21.022 --> 21:24.106
Doc, I just want to go home now.
I'm tired.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.399
You don't have to wait
back in line.

21:25.476 --> 21:26.284
I'll bring the bed
to you right here.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.110
ESTELLE:
Honey?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.403
Give it a chance.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.163
For me?

21:33.126 --> 21:34.408
Good.

21:34.485 --> 21:36.460
I'll be back.

21:41.116 --> 21:42.291
Kit.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.592
Jake.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.545
Dr. Wong, thank you for coming.

21:46.622 --> 21:49.465
Thanks for the opportunity.
You, too, 'Dolph.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.141
'Dolph?

21:51.552 --> 21:54.386
The patient will be prepped
and ready in a few hours.

21:54.463 --> 21:56.096
We'll maximize time by
dissecting donor

21:56.173 --> 21:57.815
and recipient hands
simultaneously.

21:57.892 --> 22:01.560
Working in tandem
to limit fatigue. Smart.

22:01.637 --> 22:03.604
-Tell me about the patient.
-Andy lost his hands

22:03.680 --> 22:05.481
from septic shock as a toddler.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.108
Couldn't get comfortable
with prosthetics.

22:08.185 --> 22:10.277
Besides, he wants to
feel things again.

22:10.354 --> 22:12.163
A pencil, his mother's hand.

22:12.239 --> 22:14.656
Especially his new
baseball mitt.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.242
Oh, he's a big fan
of our national pastime?

22:17.319 --> 22:19.620
Yeah, even bigger than you were.

22:19.696 --> 22:22.998
Well, in that case,
I just have one question.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.176
Where's the gift shop?

22:25.252 --> 22:29.129
You know, a new mitt
isn't complete

22:29.206 --> 22:31.006
without a new baseball.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.017
Does that mean
the surgery is on?

22:33.094 --> 22:34.593
KIT:
Yes.

22:34.670 --> 22:37.012
Dr. Wong has agreed
to be your plastic surgeon.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.639
But are you an all-star doctor?

22:38.715 --> 22:40.974
-(laughter)
-KIT: He is, Andy.

22:41.051 --> 22:42.351
Do you play baseball?

22:42.362 --> 22:45.104
I did. T-ball right through
high school.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.272
-Position?
-Center field.

22:47.349 --> 22:48.107
Best play?

22:48.183 --> 22:50.526
Seventh grade.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.487
Coach rode me all season about
getting ahead of the curveball.

22:53.564 --> 22:56.323
Had me run laps when I didn't.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.284
There were a lot of laps.
Lots of arguments.

22:59.361 --> 23:01.620
Then, game one
of our World Series,

23:01.697 --> 23:03.956
Coach puts me
in against a pitcher

23:04.032 --> 23:06.708
who threw a curve
like Doc Gooden.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.210
And what happened?

23:08.221 --> 23:11.672
I thought Coach did it
to teach me a lesson.

23:11.748 --> 23:14.174
But I got ahead of the curve

23:14.251 --> 23:16.560
and I won us the game.

23:16.637 --> 23:20.389
I realized he believed in me

23:20.400 --> 23:23.350
more than any other kid
on that team.

23:23.427 --> 23:26.070
So, how about it, Andy--

23:26.147 --> 23:29.148
is my résumé good enough
to make your team?

23:29.224 --> 23:31.283
It's a late substitution.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.986
But you're hired.

23:34.062 --> 23:35.996
(all laugh)

23:36.657 --> 23:38.574
A fetal blood transfusion?

23:38.584 --> 23:40.576
It-It's risky,
and it's our only option.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.996
-For the baby?
-Yeah, but we have to do it.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.966
The alternative is we lose her.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.428
Based on what Gabbi's told me,

23:50.504 --> 23:53.097
I think it's best
we put you under anesthesia.

23:53.174 --> 23:54.932
If you're awake,
you'll see it all.

23:55.009 --> 23:57.009
And if you flinch,

23:57.085 --> 23:58.927
the needle could
hit the umbilical cord.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.980
I'm a nurse, I won't flinch.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.057
But what if I wake up
and our baby's gone

24:04.134 --> 24:06.101
and I wasn't there for her?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.227
BILLIE:
Okay.

24:07.304 --> 24:09.021
Then stay awake.

24:09.097 --> 24:10.939
CONRAD:
But there's no upside
to being awake.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.617
Not for Nic, not for the baby,
and no reason, medically,

24:13.694 --> 24:15.277
to put her through it.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.163
Well, there's one giant reason.

24:18.032 --> 24:19.198
She might want to be awake.

24:19.274 --> 24:20.908
Well, thank you
for that, Billie.

24:20.984 --> 24:22.242
Okay, you know what?
(scoffs) I just...

24:22.319 --> 24:24.128
I can't even hear myself think.
Please.

24:25.489 --> 24:29.416
Nic, we will sort this out
and get back on the same page.

24:29.493 --> 24:32.027
Don't stress.
Billie, you got a minute?

24:35.624 --> 24:38.309
<i> Nic was stabbed</i>
<i> two weeks ago, and</i>

24:38.385 --> 24:41.136
you think she needs to watch
a needle penetrate her womb?

24:41.147 --> 24:42.429
-What I think is...
-You're not her doctor,

24:42.506 --> 24:44.648
you're not her husband.

24:44.725 --> 24:47.392
This is about you being
important and making the call,

24:47.469 --> 24:51.322
and the call is wrong.
You haven't changed.

24:51.398 --> 24:54.399
-But I...
-No buts.

24:54.476 --> 24:57.152
You need to leave now.

24:57.163 --> 25:00.247
This experiment failed.
Go. I'm not asking.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.587
Pravesh.

25:15.664 --> 25:17.097
What is this?

25:21.169 --> 25:23.011
He's not taking up a bed.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.022
I applaud the ingenuity, but
you're performing a procedure

25:25.099 --> 25:26.473
on a discharged patient.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.526
He might have
normal pressure hydrocephalus.

25:28.602 --> 25:30.936
If so, this procedure
can cure him.

25:31.013 --> 25:33.105
We can give him his life back.
But I need to complete

25:33.181 --> 25:35.983
-this lumbar puncture.
-I get it. No stone unturned.

25:36.059 --> 25:37.818
But you treated his burn.
Now what about

25:37.894 --> 25:39.486
the other patients who are
in the waiting room right now?

25:39.563 --> 25:42.030
What kind of hospital are we
if we can't spare 30 minutes

25:42.041 --> 25:44.157
that might cure a patient
who's been misdiagnosed?

25:44.234 --> 25:46.034
Admit him to Medicine
or have him make an appointment.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.120
I won't ignore a patient.

25:48.196 --> 25:49.547
That's what happened
to my father.

25:58.415 --> 26:01.976
AUSTIN:
He looks like Rain Man
in there.

26:03.253 --> 26:06.305
Could damage a nerve.
Put my plate sideways.

26:06.423 --> 26:08.899
Nerve.
Put my plate sideways.

26:08.976 --> 26:11.735
And extra vein.
Extra vein,

26:11.812 --> 26:14.146
always dissect extra vein.

26:14.222 --> 26:15.906
Oh.

26:15.983 --> 26:19.076
He's reciting a litany
of things that could go wrong.

26:19.153 --> 26:21.653
So that's his process.

26:21.730 --> 26:24.081
-Interesting.
-Mm.

26:33.408 --> 26:35.167
KIT:
We have four hours
to connect these arteries

26:35.243 --> 26:38.086
and get blood flowing
into Andy's new hands.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.547
Any longer, and this
beautiful gift will be wasted.

26:40.624 --> 26:42.433
Ready to tag
the median and ulnar.

26:42.509 --> 26:44.935
KIT:
Raring to go.

26:45.012 --> 26:47.095
I like that. And you're
working at a good pace.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.389
So are you.
Thank you for letting me

26:49.466 --> 26:51.275
join you on the dominant hand.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.691
The damn procurement team
did not

26:59.768 --> 27:01.943
cut this one down
to the right length.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.528
KIT:
Good catch.

27:03.605 --> 27:05.238
-It's too long.
-Yeah.

27:05.315 --> 27:07.699
In my experience, even
a small length issue matters.

27:07.776 --> 27:09.126
These hands will grow with him.

27:09.203 --> 27:10.911
I can work fast
to line these up properly.

27:10.987 --> 27:13.464
Do it.
We want this to be perfect.

27:13.540 --> 27:17.426
All right. Let's cut these
mittens down to size, shall we?

27:28.314 --> 27:30.147
Come in.

27:31.341 --> 27:34.485
I'm here because the board
overlooked someone

27:34.561 --> 27:37.363
who may be the best choice
for CEO.

27:39.015 --> 27:41.492
Dr. Voss.

27:41.568 --> 27:43.327
That's an inspired choice.
It's about time.

27:43.404 --> 27:45.320
Better late than never.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.322
After Kit charged into
our meeting, it became clear

27:47.333 --> 27:50.117
we don't want
a safe choice for CEO.

27:50.193 --> 27:52.911
We want someone bold,
trailblazing.

27:52.988 --> 27:55.163
And Chastain needs
a new leader by end of day.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.165
Well, this operation
is just getting started.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.167
-They'll be here all night.
-I know.

27:59.178 --> 28:02.254
The operation is her interview.

28:02.330 --> 28:05.974
So I will be here watching it
all night as well.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.353
(ultrasound whooshing)

28:18.364 --> 28:20.480
GABBI:
Safe to proceed.

28:20.557 --> 28:22.983
Visualizing the umbilical vein.
I'm going to inject the fetus

28:23.059 --> 28:25.077
with a sedative and paralytic.

28:28.190 --> 28:31.125
Don't be alarmed when she stops
moving around. That's the goal.

28:34.404 --> 28:36.296
Ready to start the transfusion.

28:42.537 --> 28:44.337
Damn it.

28:44.414 --> 28:47.057
-What is it?
-The baby's heart's
having trouble.

28:47.134 --> 28:49.217
The blood might be too much
for the fetal circulation.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.395
Her heart rate's gonna
bounce back. Give it a moment.

28:51.472 --> 28:53.305
We can't give the baby
any more blood.

28:53.381 --> 28:56.066
-(monitor alarms beeping)
-Baby's bradying down.

28:56.143 --> 28:57.309
Might be a spasm of the cord.

28:57.385 --> 28:58.435
Let's get her on her left side

28:58.512 --> 28:59.519
to improve uterine perfusion.

28:59.596 --> 29:02.189
On my count.
One, two, three.

29:02.265 --> 29:04.074
Need a liter of IV fluid.

29:07.154 --> 29:09.237
Baby's still bradying down.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.123
(monitor alarms beeping)

29:14.110 --> 29:15.919
(monitor chirps)

29:15.996 --> 29:17.329
(Gabbi and Conrad exhale)

29:17.405 --> 29:19.381
There's your little warrior.

29:20.242 --> 29:22.167
Conrad, the baby's
still paralyzed.

29:22.244 --> 29:23.919
We hope the blood
will be enough.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.171
But until the drugs wear off,
we won't know for sure

29:26.248 --> 29:29.224
if she's okay
or if Nic's miscarried.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.105
No blood.
Crystal-clear fluid.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.190
What does that mean?

29:45.267 --> 29:46.450
No obvious signs of infection.

29:46.527 --> 29:48.026
This is what we call
a champagne tap.

29:48.103 --> 29:49.528
When will we know if it worked?

29:49.604 --> 29:51.196
Soon. We've taken out
enough spinal fluid

29:51.273 --> 29:53.198
to see if he gets better.

29:53.275 --> 29:54.699
Okay, Norman,
you hold still, okay?

29:54.776 --> 29:56.293
I'm gonna pull out this needle.

29:57.704 --> 29:59.963
Okay, dear, it's done.

30:01.041 --> 30:02.624
(grunts softly)

30:02.635 --> 30:04.301
Okay.
How do you feel?

30:04.378 --> 30:07.462
Uh... I feel...

30:07.473 --> 30:08.755
-okay.
-Yeah?

30:08.832 --> 30:10.307
Why don't you walk for us.

30:10.384 --> 30:12.059
Here.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.065
(laughing)

30:20.060 --> 30:23.103
Mrs. Katz, would you
like to go waltzing?

30:23.179 --> 30:26.481
(laughs)
Baby steps, dear.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.325
This is incredible.
Thank you.

30:28.402 --> 30:32.070
So, Doc, I-I'm really
gonna be all right again?

30:32.147 --> 30:34.114
Uh, what about my head?

30:34.190 --> 30:35.949
All of your symptoms were caused

30:36.026 --> 30:37.492
by an accumulation
of spinal fluid.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.078
When I took off enough,
you got better.

30:40.155 --> 30:41.505
Your brain's gonna fully recover

30:41.582 --> 30:43.549
and you'll be back
to your old self soon.

30:43.584 --> 30:46.751
And you do not have Alzheimer's.

30:46.828 --> 30:48.628
(laughing)

30:48.705 --> 30:50.088
Thank you.

30:50.165 --> 30:51.306
My pleasure.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.344
We'll set him up
with neurosurgery

30:56.355 --> 30:59.014
for a permanent shunt.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.309
You were right.
I was wrong. Sue me.

31:02.385 --> 31:04.144
No, I was wrong, too.

31:04.220 --> 31:06.771
I thought by working at a
public hospital that I would be

31:06.848 --> 31:10.367
part of the problem, but what I
realize now is that I get to be

31:10.444 --> 31:13.445
part of the solution, and
treat patients who would never

31:13.521 --> 31:15.038
have been able
to come to Chastain.

31:15.115 --> 31:17.449
And give the kind of care...

31:17.525 --> 31:19.618
-that my dad deserved.
-Right.

31:19.694 --> 31:21.328
Insurance won't
cause us problems anymore,

31:21.404 --> 31:22.495
but you know what will?

31:22.572 --> 31:24.331
-An overwhelmed ER.
-Yeah.

31:24.407 --> 31:25.624
We have to figure out a system
that helps triage

31:25.700 --> 31:28.668
less urgent cases.
That can be done.

31:28.745 --> 31:30.295
It will be done.
But right now,

31:30.372 --> 31:32.380
let's both go see more patients.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.057
Good man.

31:49.265 --> 31:50.649
I know you said go,
but I couldn't leave

31:50.725 --> 31:52.192
until I knew Nic was okay.

31:52.268 --> 31:53.902
Nic's fine.
Not awake yet.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.487
The baby?

31:55.563 --> 31:59.124
We won't know until
the paralytic wears off.

32:00.110 --> 32:01.376
This must be awful for you.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.247
Look, I was insensitive.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.592
Just not thinking about
the fact that there are

32:08.669 --> 32:11.002
two parents involved,
and I'm an outsider.

32:11.079 --> 32:13.096
That was wrong.

32:14.249 --> 32:15.933
I continue to be wrong
about a lot of things,

32:16.009 --> 32:18.226
despite my best efforts.

32:19.179 --> 32:21.939
I'd like to revisit
what happened between us,

32:22.015 --> 32:24.557
put it all out on the table.
I want to know you understand.

32:24.634 --> 32:26.518
I think I understand quite well.

32:26.594 --> 32:30.188
Your patient had a meningioma
that had to come out.

32:30.265 --> 32:32.232
At that point, I'd done
about a hundred of those.

32:32.308 --> 32:34.859
Figured, "I'll pop this out,
no problem."

32:34.936 --> 32:37.287
I'd started doing surgeries
without my attending present

32:37.364 --> 32:40.198
because Aronson was
a lazy hack with rusty skills.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.450
He hid behind his residents.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.586
I didn't know that.

32:47.323 --> 32:50.583
I cut with impunity,
I felt triumphant,

32:50.660 --> 32:52.377
but when I tried
to wake your patient up...

32:52.454 --> 32:55.422
Yeah, massive
left hemisphere stroke.

32:55.498 --> 32:59.426
Because you didn't have
enough experience

32:59.502 --> 33:01.386
to know that
the arteries you cut

33:01.463 --> 33:03.388
weren't feeding
the patient's tumor.

33:03.465 --> 33:05.399
They were feeding
the patient's brain.

33:09.062 --> 33:11.312
Now that lovely man cannot walk,

33:11.323 --> 33:13.440
cannot talk,

33:13.516 --> 33:16.201
will live the rest of his life
in a nursing home.

33:17.070 --> 33:20.321
Yes, I understand what I did,

33:20.332 --> 33:22.874
and I will never get over it.

33:27.322 --> 33:29.006
You had to report me.

33:29.082 --> 33:31.174
I've always known that,
but it was easier

33:31.251 --> 33:34.052
to blame you than face the truth
that it was my own fault.

33:34.662 --> 33:36.421
Mm.

33:36.498 --> 33:38.974
Man, that was
really freaking hard.

33:44.547 --> 33:47.140
Anyway, it looks like
you've got this,

33:47.217 --> 33:49.526
so I'll jump.

33:49.603 --> 33:51.144
See you in a few years.

33:51.221 --> 33:53.071
Hey.

33:54.941 --> 33:58.160
(sighs) Say goodbye to Nic
before you leave.

33:59.229 --> 34:01.038
She'll be hurt if you leave
without doing that.

34:10.290 --> 34:12.207
KIT:
Plates and screws are in.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.217
AUSTIN:
Length and angle
are perfect over here.

34:14.294 --> 34:16.386
KIT:
Dr. Wong, you're up.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.393
JAKE:
Microscope.

34:31.386 --> 34:33.528
Jeweler's forceps.

34:35.390 --> 34:37.690
Starting arterial anastomosis.

34:37.767 --> 34:41.203
Microneedle holder
and 9.0 nylon.

34:52.115 --> 34:55.592
Dr. Voss is running
a smooth ship.

34:55.669 --> 34:58.586
I wouldn't expect anything less.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.380
And the new guy?

35:00.456 --> 35:02.224
Is that your doing?

35:03.009 --> 35:05.093
Dr. Wong deserves
all the credit.

35:05.104 --> 35:08.105
What you're witnessing
is God-given talent.

35:15.263 --> 35:17.564
JAKE:
Both arterial anastomoses
complete.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.440
AUSTIN:
Complete? That's all you got?

35:19.451 --> 35:22.110
-Brother, that's beautiful.
-It's the moment of truth,

35:22.121 --> 35:23.528
and you're bogging me down
with compliments?

35:23.605 --> 35:25.572
AUSTIN:
Well, have it your way, Cochise.

35:25.648 --> 35:27.874
No compliments till these
bad boys turn pink. Let's go.

35:31.705 --> 35:33.246
JAKE:
All good here.

35:33.323 --> 35:35.966
Nice.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.086
No blood flow to the right hand.

35:40.163 --> 35:41.555
Give me a Doppler.

35:49.339 --> 35:50.722
JAKE:
It's a clot.

35:50.840 --> 35:51.931
KIT:
I'll try to milk it out.
Forceps.

35:52.008 --> 35:52.974
JAKE:
The hand's too cold.

35:52.985 --> 35:55.101
We need to help it perfuse.

35:55.178 --> 35:57.863
AUSTIN:
All right, let's turn this OR
into a sweatbox.

36:02.068 --> 36:04.110
-KIT: Clot's out.
-AUSTIN: Yeah, but
the artery is short.

36:04.187 --> 36:05.904
We need to connect it.

36:05.980 --> 36:07.238
KIT:
Time is of the essence.

36:07.315 --> 36:08.665
We can't let this hand
die on us.

36:08.742 --> 36:10.000
We need a graft, and I dissected

36:10.076 --> 36:11.293
extra pieces of vein.

36:12.746 --> 36:15.046
Of course. In his premortem.

36:18.201 --> 36:20.335
JAKE:
I'll take the proximal end.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.253
-You help out on the other side.
-AUSTIN: Yeah. Got it.

36:22.330 --> 36:23.597
KIT:
We're running out of time.

36:31.506 --> 36:32.972
JAKE:
Fine work, Dr. Austin.

36:33.049 --> 36:35.183
See there,
compliments don't bog me down.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.809
(chuckles):
All set.

36:36.886 --> 36:39.196
AUSTIN:
All right, let's go.

36:45.111 --> 36:46.444
KIT:
Look at that.

36:46.521 --> 36:49.030
A boy's dream
finally becomes reality.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.490
(Austin and Kit laughing)

36:50.566 --> 36:52.242
I love this game.

36:52.318 --> 36:53.835
(laughter)

36:57.883 --> 36:59.374
She's not out of the woods yet.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.001
We won't know until
the paralytic wears off,

37:02.078 --> 37:04.554
-which should be soon.
-(Nic sighs)

37:05.632 --> 37:07.390
I don't feel so good.

37:07.467 --> 37:10.060
(monitor buzzes, beeps)

37:12.973 --> 37:15.473
-She's tachy to the 140s.
-She's cold and clammy.

37:15.550 --> 37:17.192
Heart rate's in the 180s.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.978
SVT. She needs meds
and a code cart.

37:20.054 --> 37:21.238
-I'll get it.
-I know where it is.

37:21.314 --> 37:23.022
I'll be back in 30 seconds.

37:23.099 --> 37:24.649
The baby can't handle this.

37:24.726 --> 37:26.993
I need a 10cc syringe.

37:27.654 --> 37:29.412
Here.

37:31.491 --> 37:33.199
BILLIE:
Blow into this.

37:33.276 --> 37:35.201
Hard. Try to move the plunger.

37:35.278 --> 37:36.995
(blows, gasps)

37:37.071 --> 37:39.130
Harder.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.259
(gasping)

37:45.288 --> 37:48.423
Normal sinus rhythm.
Thank you.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.425
There are a lot of ways
to break an arrhythmia.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.093
My favorite doesn't involve
an ice bucket bath

37:52.104 --> 37:53.678
that leaves the patient
wet and cold.

37:53.755 --> 37:55.096
Okay, guys, that's great,

37:55.107 --> 37:56.681
but can we figure out
what caused this?

37:56.758 --> 37:58.391
Hey, Billie, let's put
our heads together,

37:58.468 --> 37:59.526
shall we?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.444
Yes, she went into an SVT.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.954
Lots of things can cause that.

38:11.031 --> 38:13.364
Anxiety, electrolytes, hormones.

38:13.441 --> 38:14.741
Or thyroid.

38:14.817 --> 38:16.184
But her thyroid function
was low.

38:16.186 --> 38:18.619
It was, and we've been
giving her thyroid hormone.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.298
And as her thyroid function
changes during pregnancy...

38:21.374 --> 38:23.133
Now it must be too high.

38:23.209 --> 38:24.625
I'll send off
thyroid function tests,

38:24.636 --> 38:26.210
and we'll hold her next dose.

38:26.287 --> 38:27.295
Sounds like a plan.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.972
And now it's up to
our baby girl.

38:29.049 --> 38:31.215
She's a fighter.
She'll rally.

39:37.567 --> 39:39.867
Right, but you, Dr. Voss,

39:39.878 --> 39:42.203
you took this on your
shoulders-- at high risk--

39:42.214 --> 39:44.547
and gave a child back his life.

39:44.624 --> 39:47.333
I saw leadership
