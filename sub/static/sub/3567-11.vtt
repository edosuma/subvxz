Ugh. Steven! This
is a stealth mission.

00:40.337 --> 00:44.107
You're making too much
noise! Take off that jacket.

00:44.109 --> 00:49.079
- Uh, but I don't want to catch a cold!
- Then why are you still

00:49.081 --> 00:54.985
- wearing sandals?
- I can be quiet! See? Stealth.

00:54.987 --> 00:57.839
- We're getting close.
- Come on, then.

01:01.909 --> 01:03.694
Amethyst!

- It wasn't me!

- What about Garnet?

01:33.521 --> 01:35.592
Go, Garnet! Go!

01:45.213 --> 01:46.525
Wow.

01:48.301 --> 01:51.488
She's so fast!
Garnet, you're amazing!

01:51.677 --> 01:55.812
- How'd you even do that?
- Look. The little ones didn't explode!

01:55.814 --> 02:00.116
- They're drilling away!
- I got it!

02:00.118 --> 02:02.086
Let them go.
They're just parasites.

02:02.087 --> 02:06.114
If they want to be a problem,
they'll have to answer to me.

02:06.182 --> 02:11.026
- So cool!
- I swallowed a rock.

02:11.180 --> 02:14.404
<i>We all worked so
hard, we deserve a reward.</i>

02:14.405 --> 02:17.885
Sounds like you have
something in mind.

- Do we have anything else to do?

02:28.584 --> 02:31.031
- We don't.
- Uh, don't you need

02:31.033 --> 02:35.085
- money for that place?
- Oh, don't worry. This one's on...

02:35.087 --> 02:39.590

02:49.852 --> 02:52.093
Pearl, come on!
You'll love this game!

02:52.128 --> 02:55.505
If you say so.
"Road killer"?

02:55.507 --> 02:58.508
Yeah! Pick the car you like.
Then just go for it!

02:58.510 --> 03:01.261
W-which one of these buttons
is my turn signal?

03:01.262 --> 03:03.212
None of them. Have fun!

03:03.247 --> 03:08.986
- Vroom, vroom! Kill the road!
- O-kay...?

03:08.988 --> 03:12.098
This is skee-ball.
Roll the ball into the hole,

03:12.133 --> 03:14.852
and you can even win tickets for prizes.

03:16.185 --> 03:19.496
Whoa!
Onion's the ticket master!

03:19.498 --> 03:22.716
- Cool.
- All right. Good luck.

03:24.416 --> 03:29.539
- Teens of rage!
- Garnet, this game is perfect for you!

03:29.541 --> 03:32.359
<i>You seem like a Joe Rock kind of gal.</i>

03:32.360 --> 03:36.505
His special move is forward,
forward back, top towards

03:36.506 --> 03:40.651
half circle, medium kick...
Oh, wait. Maybe that's

03:40.653 --> 03:45.739
- an aerial move! Just punch, and you'll be fine.
- Come on, chump!

03:48.827 --> 03:53.230
- I did it.
- Uh... let's try something else.

03:53.232 --> 03:57.100
O-o-okay! This is a game
you can actually punch!

03:57.101 --> 04:00.822
<i>Come on,
give it the best shot, kid!</i>

04:00.929 --> 04:04.035
- Tell my wife I'm sorry!
- I win again.

04:04.236 --> 04:08.545
Uh... Um... Uh, how 'bout that one?
Meat beat mania!

04:08.547 --> 04:13.246
There's no violence in this game.
Just shake the meat to the beat!

04:13.281 --> 04:15.974
<i>Are you ready? Let's meat it!</i>

04:16.009 --> 04:20.557
<i>Shake it! Shake it!
That's it! Well done!</i>

04:20.559 --> 04:24.687
<i>Keep it up! Now you're
cooking! Ooh, tasty! Keep it up!</i>

04:24.688 --> 04:26.063
Awesome!

04:26.065 --> 04:29.888
Garnet, you're so good at this!
Whew!

04:30.536 --> 04:33.203
- I wonder how the others are doing.
- You're horrible!

04:33.205 --> 04:36.062
- Stop saying that!
- Uh, having fun?

04:36.063 --> 04:37.491
Why am I doing so badly?

04:37.493 --> 04:40.977
- I haven't crashed into anything.
- You're supposed to

04:40.979 --> 04:43.947
- crash into everything.
- What?! That's horrible!

04:43.949 --> 04:46.483
- you're horrible!
- Amethyst!

04:49.828 --> 04:53.147
- What are you doing?!
- I'm-a win a airplane!

04:53.182 --> 04:56.067
That's cheating!
You're gonna get us in so much tro...

04:56.102 --> 04:58.788
Hey! Do you guys know what
happened to Teens of rage?

04:58.789 --> 05:01.965
- Let's run!
- This place is fun!

05:01.967 --> 05:06.436
- Pearl, we're leaving!
- Good!

05:06.438 --> 05:09.523
- You're fantastic!
- Garnet, we're leaving!

05:11.231 --> 05:13.090
What happened to punch buddy?

05:13.100 --> 05:17.480
- Who did this to you?!
- Uh, see you at home!

05:19.454 --> 05:23.820
So, w-what's today's
mission? I hope it's...

05:23.822 --> 05:28.859
- fighting... a giant... foot!
- If we're supposed

05:28.861 --> 05:32.882
to fight a "giant foot"...
Garnet would let us know.

05:32.917 --> 05:36.933
- Yeah. Garnet's the boss.
- Well, we're all a team.

05:36.935 --> 05:38.853
Garnet just has
heightened perception

05:38.854 --> 05:40.771
that guides us towards our
mission objectives.

05:40.773 --> 05:44.975
- Yeah... She's the boss.
- So, where is she?

05:44.977 --> 05:48.987
- F-fighting the foot?
- She's not "fighting the foot."

05:49.022 --> 05:51.915
You know Garnet goes off on
missions without us all the time.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.618
She's probably doing
something very important.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.704
Oh, wait, Steven!
I just remembered ...

05:56.705 --> 05:58.789
Garnet had a special mission for you.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.958
- Really?!
- Yeah! She says, um...

06:01.960 --> 06:07.130
- "you have to slam your face into that bowl of cereal."
- Okay.

06:07.132 --> 06:10.189
Good job, Steven!
You stopped the foot!

06:10.190 --> 06:13.712
- There is no foot!
- Not anymore.

06:13.713 --> 06:15.705
- Ugh!
- Well...

06:15.707 --> 06:20.477
...now that that's done, time to
comb the beach for quarters

06:20.479 --> 06:23.039
with my... metal mutt!

06:25.601 --> 06:30.049
Silver dollar?
Useless! Come on.

06:31.406 --> 06:35.347
This better not be another cat.

06:36.348 --> 06:37.994
Double dogs!

06:37.996 --> 06:42.479
Quarters!

06:42.710 --> 06:45.836
Help!

07:00.086 --> 07:03.216
Steven!

07:03.251 --> 07:05.368
It's the little guys!

07:32.204 --> 07:35.548
They're everywhere!
Why didn't we see this coming?!

07:35.583 --> 07:36.966
We need Garnet!

07:37.001 --> 07:39.680
<i>We don't know where she is!</i>

07:40.142 --> 07:43.261
<i>Meat beat mania!</i>

07:43.761 --> 07:48.679
- Steven, where are you going?!
- Huh?

07:51.820 --> 07:55.960
Garnet! You got to come quick!
Whew! Garnet!

07:55.991 --> 08:00.911
Those little guys are back, and ...
and they're a problem!

08:00.946 --> 08:06.893
Whoa. Wh-o-o-a-a! I've
never seen anyone get this far!

08:06.928 --> 08:10.620
B-b-but you gotta
get back and help the others!

08:10.622 --> 08:14.791
Uh, Garnet?
Garnet, come on!

08:16.680 --> 08:20.532
Garnet! Hey!

08:20.943 --> 08:24.667
This is serious! Pearl and
Amethyst are in trouble!

08:24.669 --> 08:29.656
Garnet, why... are you...

08:29.657 --> 08:33.280
so... hard... to climb?!
Garnet!

08:34.645 --> 08:39.245
- That's rare!
- Oh, my gosh!

08:42.654 --> 08:44.950
I'll save you, Garnet!

08:44.951 --> 08:49.137
<i>Well done! Tasty!
Now you're cookin...</i>

08:55.759 --> 08:59.386
<i>Meat the beat!
Time to turn up the heat.</i>

09:01.974 --> 09:08.378
The rhythm has her.
The only way to defeat... the beat...

09:08.380 --> 09:12.849
- is with meat.
- A new cook has entered the kitchen.

09:12.851 --> 09:16.186
I have to win!

09:16.188 --> 09:19.483
<i>Let's meat it!
Prepare your meats!</i>

09:19.658 --> 09:23.674
<i>Shake it!
Tenderize!</i>

09:25.864 --> 09:27.998
<i>Player 1 wins!</i>

09:28.000 --> 09:32.202
<i>You're toast, player 2.</i>

09:32.204 --> 09:33.920
<i>Eat it up!</i>

09:36.108 --> 09:41.411
<i>- A player 2 barbecue!
- Aw, no!</i>

09:41.413 --> 09:44.631
My last shot!

09:44.633 --> 09:47.550
<i>Let's meat it!
Rack those ribs!</i>

09:47.552 --> 09:51.755
<i>Spice it up!
Thrill is in the grill.</i>

09:51.757 --> 09:53.589
<i>You're toasted.</i>

09:58.981 --> 10:03.149
This... is... it!

10:05.603 --> 10:08.938
<i>Player 1 wins!
You're toast, player 2.</i>

10:08.940 --> 10:12.826
I can't do it!
Garnet, snap out of it!

10:12.828 --> 10:16.913
<i>What's wrong with you?!
You've got to stop playing this</i>

10:16.915 --> 10:21.051
horrible ga-a-a-me!

10:32.804 --> 10:36.632
- Steven!
- Garnet!

10:38.998 --> 10:43.656
- You won.
- Huh? Huh?! It was you!

10:43.658 --> 10:47.937

10:54.204 --> 10:58.268
Oh, no! No, no! Don't you go
flippity-floppin' out of here!

11:00.754 --> 11:03.890
Yeah!

11:03.891 --> 11:06.829
