WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:05.834
Jessie will

00:05.835 --> 00:07.417
be back from her

00:04.250 --> 00:07.417
TV audition soon.

00:07.459 --> 00:09.042
- When she does not
- get the part,

00:09.083 --> 00:10.647
We must be ready

00:10.648 --> 00:12.209
to cheer her up.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.543
I just hope Jessie

00:13.544 --> 00:14.834
wrote to Santa

00:12.250 --> 00:14.834
about this part,

00:14.876 --> 00:15.938
because she

00:15.939 --> 00:17.000
needs all the help

00:14.876 --> 00:17.000
she can get.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.500
- Zuri, I know
- Santa magically

00:20.542 --> 00:21.647
Delivers presents

00:21.648 --> 00:22.751
to every child

00:20.542 --> 00:22.751
on the planet,

00:22.792 --> 00:24.022
but some miracles

00:24.023 --> 00:25.250
even he can't pull off.

00:22.792 --> 00:25.250
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
(SHRIEKS)

00:29.959 --> 00:31.459
Guess who just booked

00:31.460 --> 00:32.959
a part on Aloha Crime?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.376
Ooh, was it that

00:34.377 --> 00:35.751
new girl who lives

00:33.000 --> 00:35.751
down the hall?

00:35.792 --> 00:37.833
- No, it's the old - girl who lives
- Here with you!

00:39.083 --> 00:40.083
Not that I'm old.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.709
Tell your laugh lines.

00:44.542 --> 00:46.918
- Those are worry lines,
- and guess who gave them to me?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.334
- Anyway,
- I got the role,

00:50.375 --> 00:52.250
- And the best part is,
- it shoots in Hawaii.

00:52.292 --> 00:53.375
I'm leaving tomorrow!

00:53.417 --> 00:55.042
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:55.083 --> 00:56.042
- We are not the kind
- of people

00:56.083 --> 00:57.959
- Who make it
- all about us,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.626
But what about us?

01:01.083 --> 01:02.918
- Well, I talked
- to your parents,

01:02.959 --> 01:03.976
- And convinced - them that we
- Should all spend

01:04.000 --> 01:05.022
Christmas in Hawaii

01:05.022 --> 01:06.042
together!

01:06.083 --> 01:07.792
- Yes.
- Whoa.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.085
So much for Bertram

01:09.086 --> 01:10.334
having our Hawaiian

01:07.834 --> 01:10.334
villa all to himself.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.542
- We just got
- our first

01:11.584 --> 01:13.314
"glad you are not here"

01:13.315 --> 01:15.042
postcard from him.

01:15.083 --> 01:16.876
So not only do

01:16.877 --> 01:18.667
we get to spend

01:15.083 --> 01:18.667
Christmas in Hawaii,

01:18.709 --> 01:19.772
but we get to crash

01:19.773 --> 01:20.834
Bertram's vacation

01:20.876 --> 01:21.960
and make

01:21.961 --> 01:23.042
him miserable?

01:20.876 --> 01:23.042
Yup.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.876
- The look of anguish
- on his face

01:24.918 --> 01:25.918
Will be the only

01:25.919 --> 01:26.918
Christmas present

01:24.918 --> 01:26.918
I need this year.

01:26.959 --> 01:28.759
- But don't tell - your parents
- I said that.

- This place

broke into our villa!

- I don't know whether - to
call the cops or - Ask her out.

02:53.083 --> 02:54.563
Wow. Things must

02:54.564 --> 02:56.042
have really gone

02:53.083 --> 02:56.042
downhill for her

02:56.083 --> 02:57.042
since Mayan Mayhem.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.000
Let's give her a few bucks.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.251
Oh! And you brought

03:02.252 --> 03:03.667
the sprogs with you!

03:03.709 --> 03:04.876
But what are you

03:04.877 --> 03:06.042
doing in my villa?

03:06.083 --> 03:07.438
Last time I looked,

03:07.439 --> 03:08.792
this was our villa,

03:08.834 --> 03:10.185
- and we're here
- for Christmas vacation.

03:10.209 --> 03:11.938
Oh, my gosh,

03:11.939 --> 03:13.667
are you my present?

03:13.709 --> 03:14.959
Thank you, Santa!

03:15.000 --> 03:16.584
- I owe you a plate
- full of cookies!

03:20.209 --> 03:21.667
He hasn't changed.

03:21.709 --> 03:23.230
- I think he's
- actually gotten worse.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.000
- And stronger.
- (STRAINING)

03:29.500 --> 03:30.522
So, I'm confused.

03:30.523 --> 03:31.542
What are you doing here?

03:31.584 --> 03:32.709
I rented this villa

03:32.710 --> 03:33.834
on a vacation website

03:33.876 --> 03:35.709
- called
- Winkle, Winkle, Little Star.

03:35.751 --> 03:36.897
Yeah. It even

03:36.898 --> 03:38.042
comes with a butler.

03:38.083 --> 03:39.563
Mademoiselle Michaels.

03:39.564 --> 03:41.042
Your holiday crudites.

03:41.083 --> 03:42.209
(GASPING)

03:42.250 --> 03:44.042
Aloha, Bertram.

03:44.083 --> 03:46.000
(WAILING)

03:49.083 --> 03:50.334
So I'm not quite

03:50.335 --> 03:51.584
sure what's

03:49.083 --> 03:51.584
going on here...

03:51.626 --> 03:52.834
Well, Bertram

03:52.835 --> 03:54.042
wasn't expecting us,

03:51.626 --> 03:54.042
so obviously

03:54.083 --> 03:55.083
he rented the villa out

03:55.125 --> 03:56.626
- to make a little
- extra cash.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.042
That's horrible!

03:58.083 --> 03:59.626
- Why didn't
- I think of it?

04:01.918 --> 04:03.834
- So, you guys are
- here on vacation?

04:03.876 --> 04:05.542
- Actually, it's
- a working vacation.

04:05.584 --> 04:06.688
Because I'm working.

04:06.689 --> 04:07.792
As an actor.

04:05.584 --> 04:07.792
I'm a working actor!

04:09.042 --> 04:10.042
Yeah, got a little show

04:10.043 --> 04:11.043
called Aloha Crime.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.563
That's awesome!

04:12.564 --> 04:14.042
So, how are you

04:11.083 --> 04:14.042
preparing for the role?

04:14.083 --> 04:15.667
- Interviewing
- local authorities?

04:15.709 --> 04:17.541
- Studying the island
- and its customs?

04:17.584 --> 04:19.041
- Actually, I just
- learned my lines

04:19.083 --> 04:21.541
And ate a pound of poi.

04:21.584 --> 04:23.224
- That explains that smell
- on the plane.

04:27.751 --> 04:28.772
Well, no luck landing

04:28.773 --> 04:29.792
a place to stay.

04:29.834 --> 04:30.939
The whole

04:30.940 --> 04:32.042
island is booked up

04:29.834 --> 04:32.042
for the holidays.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.602
- Bertram, I can't
- believe you rented out

04:33.626 --> 04:35.125
Morgan and Christina's villa.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.355
You are gonna give

04:36.356 --> 04:37.542
Shaylee back her

04:35.167 --> 04:37.542
money right now.

04:37.584 --> 04:39.188
(INHALES SHARPLY)

04:39.189 --> 04:40.792
I'd love to, but I spent

04:37.584 --> 04:40.792
it all on essentials.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.000
You know,

04:42.042 --> 04:42.876
food, clothes...

04:42.918 --> 04:44.542
A dune buggy.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.418
You know what? It's okay.

04:47.419 --> 04:48.751
Yeah, I can just camp out.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.143
- Remember, I grew
- up in the Outback.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.563
As a baby,

04:51.564 --> 04:52.959
I used a scorpion

04:50.167 --> 04:52.959
as a pacifier.

04:54.292 --> 04:55.668
See, all fixed!

04:55.669 --> 04:57.042
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

04:57.083 --> 04:58.542
No. I'll go make lunch.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.042
- Why don't you - stay with us?
- Really?

05:03.083 --> 05:04.876
Oh. Thanks, Jessie.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.459
I can't wait

05:06.460 --> 05:08.000
to stay up all

05:04.918 --> 05:08.000
night with Shaylee!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.522
Me, too! We need

05:10.523 --> 05:12.042
a third for Go Fish.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.834
- You just
- don't get it.

05:18.334 --> 05:19.584
(LAUGHS) Shaylee,

05:19.585 --> 05:20.834
you can bunk with me.

05:20.876 --> 05:21.898
Oh, yay!

05:21.899 --> 05:22.918
Another sleep over!

05:22.959 --> 05:24.268
- I'm gonna - put your bra
- In hot water,

05:24.292 --> 05:26.209
- And your hand
- in the freezer!

05:26.250 --> 05:27.564
Okay, we need

05:27.565 --> 05:28.876
to review sleepover

05:26.250 --> 05:28.876
shenanigans.

05:30.876 --> 05:31.960
Okay, Shaylee,

05:31.961 --> 05:33.042
honest opinion,

05:33.083 --> 05:34.284
- who wears
- this better? Huh?

05:35.959 --> 05:37.834
- Frankly, you both
- look ridiculous.

05:37.876 --> 05:39.022
I told you the antlers

05:39.023 --> 05:40.167
were too much.

05:43.292 --> 05:44.792
What the hula?

05:46.083 --> 05:48.042
- This is Parker
- and Joey Rooney.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.918
- Their family is
- visiting from Wisconsin

05:49.959 --> 05:51.709
- And renting
- the villa next door.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.417
They've been

05:53.418 --> 05:55.083
coming over... A lot.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.563
We try to walk that

05:56.564 --> 05:58.000
fine line between

05:55.125 --> 05:58.000
fan and stalker.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.268
- Like right now,
- I'm fighting the urge

06:01.292 --> 06:02.292
To take your used tissue

06:02.334 --> 06:03.334
out of that trash can.

06:03.375 --> 06:06.959
Oh... Keep fighting it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.500
Shaylee, let's go

06:08.501 --> 06:10.000
tell Bertram he has

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
two more kids to feed.

06:10.042 --> 06:10.959
- If you can't
- get your money back,

06:11.000 --> 06:12.321
- You might as well
- see him cry.

06:14.876 --> 06:18.918
Ooh. Hello.

06:18.959 --> 06:21.126
I'm Joey. And you

06:21.127 --> 06:23.292
are one tall drink

06:18.959 --> 06:23.292
of tropical punch.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.083
I'm Emma,

06:26.125 --> 06:28.000
- and I feel - really bad for
- Those coconuts.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.751
Hey, buddy,

06:33.083 --> 06:35.042
- can you tell me
- if she's single?

06:35.083 --> 06:36.876
Yes, she is.

06:36.877 --> 06:38.667
Good luck with that.

06:45.876 --> 06:46.918
Why is he

06:46.919 --> 06:47.959
staring at me

06:45.876 --> 06:47.959
like that?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.500
Well, they eat a lot

06:49.501 --> 06:51.000
of cheese in Wisconsin.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.334
Maybe he's just backed up.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.416
- Well, then - I'm going to leave
- Before he blows.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.044
- Dude, stop it. - You're embarrassing
- Yourself.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.959
(SCOFFS) No, I'm not.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.834
I am wooing her.

07:04.876 --> 07:06.000
This is how you woo.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.459
He isn't too bright.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.751
Yes, we have

07:10.752 --> 07:12.000
one of those in

07:09.500 --> 07:12.000
the Luke model.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.042
- So, who wants to
- check out the island?

07:15.083 --> 07:16.125
Ugh. Count me out.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.501
I'm not sure my fair

07:17.502 --> 07:18.834
Wisconsin complexion

07:18.876 --> 07:20.459
- can handle that
- harsh Hawaiian sun.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.083
- I'm heading out
- for a swim.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.000
- Anyone want - to come with?
- Race ya!

07:26.959 --> 07:28.042
Hey, Shaylee,

07:28.083 --> 07:29.185
- after lunch, - do you want to
- Come see where

07:29.209 --> 07:30.476
- I'm shooting my
- scene tomorrow?

07:30.500 --> 07:32.018
- It's actually right
- here at the resort.

07:32.042 --> 07:33.042
Yeah, sure!

07:34.083 --> 07:35.209
Oh, uh, do not

07:35.210 --> 07:36.334
be afraid, Shaylee.

07:36.375 --> 07:37.709
Just think

07:37.710 --> 07:39.042
of Mrs. Kipling

07:36.375 --> 07:39.042
as a doggie,

07:39.083 --> 07:41.042
- with killer claws,
- razor-sharp fangs

07:41.083 --> 07:42.167
And poisonous saliva.

07:42.209 --> 07:44.000
- Actually, maybe you
- should be afraid.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.668
Nah. Wild animals

07:46.669 --> 07:48.042
don't scare me,

07:48.083 --> 07:49.834
I scare them.

07:49.876 --> 07:50.959

(ALL GROANING)

07:56.292 --> 07:57.771
Oh, you really

07:57.772 --> 07:59.250
did scare her.

07:59.292 --> 08:00.439
Bertram!

08:00.440 --> 08:01.584
Can you bring some

07:59.292 --> 08:01.584
paper towels?

08:01.626 --> 08:04.375
And a hazmat suit?

08:04.417 --> 08:05.814
See? I told you

08:05.815 --> 08:07.209
Mrs. Kipling ate

08:04.417 --> 08:07.209
my homework!

08:09.209 --> 08:11.209
- I hope you're not - expecting me to
- Check that.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
So, this is

08:17.001 --> 08:18.000
where you shoot

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
your first scene?

08:18.042 --> 08:19.042
Yep. I play

08:19.043 --> 08:20.043
a mainland FBI agent

08:20.083 --> 08:21.563
helping the local

08:21.564 --> 08:23.042
cops with a homicide

08:20.083 --> 08:23.042
at this luau.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.417
It's a hula-dunnit!

08:24.459 --> 08:26.292
Hula! Get it?

08:27.876 --> 08:29.042
Got it.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.042
- If you guys
- are here for a luau,

08:31.083 --> 08:32.042
- You'll have to come back
- Christmas Eve.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.958
- They're shooting
- some silly TV show.

My name is Keahi.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.167
Oh, that means "fire"

08:47.168 --> 08:48.250
in Hawaiian.

08:48.292 --> 08:49.709
My name is Ravi,

08:49.710 --> 08:51.125
which means

08:48.292 --> 08:51.125
"sun" in Hindi.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.584
So, I guess you

08:52.585 --> 08:54.000
could say we are

08:51.167 --> 08:54.000
both hot stuff.

08:55.626 --> 08:57.459
Wow, I found

08:57.460 --> 08:59.292
someone who is

08:55.626 --> 08:59.292
willing to talk to me!

08:59.334 --> 09:00.938
This is turning out

09:00.939 --> 09:02.542
to be the best vacation ever!

09:02.584 --> 09:04.292
Wow, you set the

09:04.293 --> 09:06.000
fun bar really low.

09:06.042 --> 09:07.082
- I like that
- in a guest.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.251
Can I interest

09:09.252 --> 09:10.417
you in one of

09:08.083 --> 09:10.417
our nature walks?

09:10.459 --> 09:11.751
I talk about the history

09:11.752 --> 09:13.042
of the island,

09:13.083 --> 09:14.250
then I juggle jellyfish.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.209
Tipping is allowed.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.083
You mean right now?

09:21.083 --> 09:22.083
'Tis the season.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.042
- I am not sure what is
- appropriate...

09:25.083 --> 09:26.542
That'll do.

09:26.543 --> 09:28.000
You can give me

09:25.083 --> 09:28.000
the rest later.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.542
So, here is a legend

09:32.543 --> 09:35.000
of our local volcano.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.000
When angered, it erupts!

09:38.083 --> 09:39.143
Much like our resort guests

09:39.167 --> 09:40.927
- when they find out
- about the parking fee.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.772
Actually,

09:44.773 --> 09:46.459
volcanic eruptions are caused

09:43.083 --> 09:46.459
by the buoyancy of magma.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.980
And your local volcano

09:47.981 --> 09:49.459
is dormant. Boom!

09:49.500 --> 09:51.084
Dropped that

09:51.085 --> 09:52.667
knowledge like it

09:49.500 --> 09:52.667
was hot lava.

09:52.709 --> 09:54.126
So you already

09:54.127 --> 09:55.542
know a lot about

09:52.709 --> 09:55.542
our island.

09:57.042 --> 09:58.282
- I'm not giving
- the tip back.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.083
But every year

10:02.125 --> 10:03.625
we pick one

10:03.626 --> 10:05.125
very enthusiastic

10:02.125 --> 10:05.125

10:05.167 --> 10:06.605
to be the narrator

10:06.606 --> 10:08.042
for our Christmas

10:05.167 --> 10:08.042
Eve Luau.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.542
Oh.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.000
That sounds wonderful.

10:08.083 --> 10:11.000
I hope you find somebody.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.042
Oh, did you mean me?

10:15.083 --> 10:16.751
Sorry, I have never been

10:16.752 --> 10:18.417
picked for anything before.

10:18.459 --> 10:20.000
- Yeah, I kind of
- got that vibe.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.334
Oh...

10:27.375 --> 10:29.334
- Ooh, what have
- we here? Huh.

10:30.709 --> 10:32.168
A coupon for

10:32.169 --> 10:33.626
back hair removal?

10:33.667 --> 10:34.834
Maybe I'll be

10:34.835 --> 10:36.000
hitting the hot tub

10:33.667 --> 10:36.000
after all.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.459
Oh. Just a prank

10:42.460 --> 10:43.667
we pulled on you.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.876
What's so funny about

10:45.877 --> 10:48.042
a piece of fishing line

10:43.709 --> 10:48.042
attached to a coupon?

10:48.083 --> 10:49.563
Well, the coupon

10:49.564 --> 10:51.042
is covered in

10:48.083 --> 10:51.042
Stay Stuck glue,

10:51.083 --> 10:52.334
and that fishing line

10:52.335 --> 10:53.584
is tied to that jet ski.

11:00.918 --> 11:02.125
the beginning of a

10:59.709 --> 11:02.125
beautiful friendship.

11:02.167 --> 11:03.230
That's based on

11:03.231 --> 11:04.292
the misery of others.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.563
You two are

11:07.564 --> 11:09.042
like a couple

11:06.083 --> 11:09.042
of menehune.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.042
A mene-who-now?

11:11.083 --> 11:12.667
Menehune. They are

11:12.668 --> 11:14.250
Hawaiian pranking elves

11:11.083 --> 11:14.250
who live in the forest.

11:14.292 --> 11:15.917
Are they the ones

11:15.918 --> 11:17.542
who tricked you into

11:14.292 --> 11:17.542
buying that outfit?

11:19.250 --> 11:20.918
I am just lucky

11:20.919 --> 11:22.584
I found all of this

11:19.250 --> 11:22.584
in my size.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.334
- You know what's
- not lucky?

11:26.375 --> 11:27.459
My eyeballs.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.168
Just for that,

11:30.169 --> 11:31.209
if it rains,

11:31.250 --> 11:32.397
I will not make room

11:32.398 --> 11:33.542
for you under my hat.

11:37.334 --> 11:38.792
- I can't believe
- I'm saying this,

11:38.834 --> 11:40.000
But your brother

11:40.042 --> 11:41.126
might be even more

11:41.127 --> 11:42.209
embarrassing than mine.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.542
It's not just Ravi.

11:45.584 --> 11:47.001
These tourists

11:47.002 --> 11:48.417
will open up their

wallets for anything.

Hey, I just had

11:49.502 --> 11:50.542
a great idea!

11:50.584 --> 11:51.814
Let's throw some

11:51.815 --> 11:53.042
sand in a jar, slap

11:50.584 --> 11:53.042
a price tag on it

11:53.083 --> 11:54.404
- and see if these
- suckers bite.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.876
The joke's on you.

12:02.877 --> 12:04.667
I got the coupon

12:01.083 --> 12:04.667
after all.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.438
The joke's on you.

12:08.439 --> 12:10.083

What?

12:11.667 --> 12:13.584
(SOBBING)

12:18.626 --> 12:19.938
Ha! I wiped the floor

12:19.939 --> 12:21.250
with you, Luke,

12:21.292 --> 12:22.876
and I learned how

12:22.877 --> 12:24.459
to play basketball from

12:21.292 --> 12:24.459
my sister, Maddie.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.667
- That explains
- the sports bra.

12:29.834 --> 12:30.856
The only baskets

12:30.857 --> 12:31.876
you made

12:31.918 --> 12:33.126
were when I went to

12:33.127 --> 12:34.334
get a drink of water.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.605
And you did not

12:35.606 --> 12:36.834
call the time out!

12:38.167 --> 12:39.397
That last shot. Whoo...

12:39.398 --> 12:40.626
Was nothin' but net.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.272
Yeah, nothing

12:43.273 --> 12:44.459
but net.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.543
Right after

12:45.544 --> 12:46.584
it bounced

12:44.500 --> 12:46.584
off a palm tree,

12:46.626 --> 12:47.855
a lifeguard's head,

12:47.856 --> 12:49.083
and a very surprised

12:46.626 --> 12:49.083
seagull.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.834
It still counts.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.542
Wow, Bertram,

12:59.543 --> 13:01.000
that's a big meatball.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.626
It's a basketball!

13:05.083 --> 13:06.876
- Why would you
- cook a basketball?

13:09.292 --> 13:10.792
I despise you, Luke.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.480
You too, weird kid

13:13.481 --> 13:14.542
who keeps coming over.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.584
Hmm, not bad.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.834
- You're still
- gonna eat that?

13:25.876 --> 13:27.076
- Of course I'm
- gonna eat it!

13:29.751 --> 13:31.189
Hey, Joey.

13:31.190 --> 13:32.626
How's your

13:29.751 --> 13:32.626
sunburn doing?

13:32.667 --> 13:34.084
Great! My blisters

13:34.085 --> 13:35.500
are starting to

13:32.667 --> 13:35.500
fill with pus!

13:35.542 --> 13:36.585
Wanna see me pop one?

13:36.586 --> 13:37.626
My record is two feet.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.292
You must be so proud.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.042
(LAUGHING)

13:45.083 --> 13:46.355
I'm sure Emma

13:46.356 --> 13:47.626
appreciated

13:45.083 --> 13:47.626
the pus report.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.125
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

13:49.167 --> 13:50.480
She probably thinks

13:50.481 --> 13:51.792
I'm a brain-dead

13:49.167 --> 13:51.792
zombie goofball.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.709
That's not true.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.209
- She knows you're
- not a zombie.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.751
Hey, man, maybe

13:58.792 --> 14:00.043
I can give you

14:00.044 --> 14:01.292
some pointers on how

13:58.792 --> 14:01.292
to impress Emma.

14:01.334 --> 14:02.355
Thanks, buddy.

14:02.356 --> 14:03.375
I just hope

14:01.334 --> 14:03.375
they're better than

14:03.417 --> 14:04.564
your three-pointers!

14:04.565 --> 14:05.709
Boo-yah!

14:07.125 --> 14:08.522
I'm gonna go

14:08.523 --> 14:09.918
get a pen!

14:09.959 --> 14:11.001
Are you really going

14:11.002 --> 14:12.042
to help him date

14:09.959 --> 14:12.042
your sister?

14:12.083 --> 14:14.000
Yeah, I'm gonna help him...

14:14.042 --> 14:15.709
Embarrass himself.

14:15.751 --> 14:17.043
That'll teach him

14:17.044 --> 14:18.334
to shoot his mouth off

14:15.751 --> 14:18.334
about his bogus win.

14:19.959 --> 14:20.980
You're not going to

14:20.981 --> 14:22.000
try and stop me, right?

14:22.042 --> 14:23.481
As long as I don't

14:23.482 --> 14:24.918
have to clean anything up,

14:22.042 --> 14:24.918
knock yourself out.

Jessie,

14:37.042 --> 14:38.646
I'm guessing you're

14:38.647 --> 14:40.250
feeling nervous about

14:37.042 --> 14:40.250
your shoot tomorrow.

14:40.292 --> 14:42.000
- What makes
- you say that?

14:42.042 --> 14:43.189
I remember you

14:43.190 --> 14:44.334
telling me that

14:42.042 --> 14:44.334
doing Origami

14:44.375 --> 14:46.042
helps calm you down.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.959
- Yeah.
- Sorry about that.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.314
I guess I went

14:54.315 --> 14:55.626
a little overboard.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.188
- I think our plane - tickets home are
- Somewhere in this mess.

14:59.626 --> 15:01.334
You know, Jessie,

15:01.375 --> 15:02.480
I was really

15:02.481 --> 15:03.584
nervous before my

15:01.375 --> 15:03.584
first acting job, too.

15:03.626 --> 15:04.751
Really? What did you

15:05.918 --> 15:07.459
- Well, actually,

I'll think

15:13.440 --> 15:15.042
I'll stick

15:11.834 --> 15:15.042
with the swans.

Oh, thank you.

You saved a life!

22:22.042 --> 22:23.501
You're like a fireman.

22:23.502 --> 22:24.959
Or the fashion police.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
LUKE: Uh...

22:27.959 --> 22:31.042
Emma, it's a pig!

22:31.083 --> 22:32.605
It rolls around

22:32.606 --> 22:34.125
in its own filth

22:31.083 --> 22:34.125
and it eats garbage.

22:34.959 --> 22:36.042
So do you.

22:37.417 --> 22:38.626
At least

22:38.627 --> 22:39.834
the pig's pink

22:37.417 --> 22:39.834
and cuddly!

22:39.876 --> 22:41.460
Throw a little

22:41.461 --> 22:43.042
glitter on this thing,

22:39.876 --> 22:43.042
and it's my dream pet!

22:43.083 --> 22:45.000
Thank you, Joey!

22:45.918 --> 22:46.918
(PIG GRUNTING)

22:47.918 --> 22:49.292
They both look so happy.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Epic fail!

22:54.083 --> 22:55.918
- So, what are we
- going to name him?

22:56.834 --> 22:58.042
How about Hamlet?

22:58.083 --> 23:00.042
I love it!

23:00.083 --> 23:02.324
- It's classy, - and it acknowledges
- His pork heritage.

23:09.876 --> 23:11.101
- Judging by the
- juice spatter,

23:11.125 --> 23:12.417
- I'd say this
- hula girl was

23:12.459 --> 23:13.730
Pineappled between

23:13.731 --> 23:15.000
3:00 and 4:00 a.m.

23:15.042 --> 23:17.063
Time to find this perp

23:17.064 --> 23:19.083
and make him go...

23:15.042 --> 23:19.083
Aloha.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.042
Cut!

23:22.083 --> 23:23.375
- Jessie, that
- was amazing!

23:23.417 --> 23:24.751
Thank you.

23:24.792 --> 23:26.751
- Yes, yes, great,
- but, Shaylee,

23:26.792 --> 23:28.418
I loved the emotion

23:28.419 --> 23:30.042
you showed in that scene.

23:30.083 --> 23:31.250
Oh, you want emotion?

23:31.292 --> 23:33.000
I can make myself cry.

23:33.042 --> 23:34.852
- Just give me 30 - seconds to think
- About my dating life,

23:34.876 --> 23:36.355
And I can turn this

23:36.356 --> 23:37.834
whole crime scene

23:34.876 --> 23:37.834
into a splash zone.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.460
Charming.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.042
So, Shaylee, I feel

23:37.876 --> 23:41.042
like Agent Vickers'

23:41.083 --> 23:43.042
- partner needs
- a monologue here.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.834
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

23:44.876 --> 23:46.001
(STAMMERS) But I

23:46.002 --> 23:47.125
have a monologue

23:44.876 --> 23:47.125
in this scene.

23:47.167 --> 23:49.059
- Are you saying - you want to give
- Shaylee my lines?

23:49.083 --> 23:50.897
Oh, no, no!

23:50.898 --> 23:52.709
Not all of them.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.042
- Judging by this
- juice spatter,

23:58.083 --> 23:59.083
- I'd say this
- hula girl

23:59.125 --> 24:00.459
- Was pineappled
- between

24:00.500 --> 24:02.417
3:00 and 4:00 a.m.

24:02.459 --> 24:04.938
Time to find this perp

24:04.939 --> 24:07.417
and make him go...

24:02.459 --> 24:07.417
Aloha.

24:09.042 --> 24:10.500
Uh... Cut!

24:10.542 --> 24:12.042
(BELL RINGING)

24:12.083 --> 24:13.605
Hmm, the scene

24:13.606 --> 24:15.125
didn't quite work.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.209
I agree.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.042
- Yeah. Me, too.
- I told you

24:18.083 --> 24:20.059
- I shouldn't have - these lines,
- They're Jessie's.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.042
- Don't worry, - I'm going to
- Make Jessie

24:22.083 --> 24:24.042
- The most
- important character

24:24.083 --> 24:26.042
- In the entire
- murder mystery.

24:26.083 --> 24:27.959
- (CHUCKLES)
- Now we're talking!

24:29.000 --> 24:31.022
Actually, I'm

24:31.023 --> 24:33.042
not talking...

24:29.000 --> 24:33.042
Or breathing.

24:33.083 --> 24:34.393
- Right, because
- you're a corpse.

24:34.417 --> 24:36.042
- Can't you see,
- you're the center

24:36.083 --> 24:38.042
Of the whole mystery!

24:38.083 --> 24:40.044
- I can't see - anything, because
- I'm face down.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.250
Look...

24:42.292 --> 24:44.083
This is all wrong.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.976
- Yeah, you're a - little too high-strung
- To be a corpse.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.439
I'm going to go

24:47.440 --> 24:48.876
with the dummy.

24:48.918 --> 24:50.310
- So, what role - would you like
- Me to play?

24:50.334 --> 24:52.250
- The role of the
- fired actress.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.334
What?

24:54.375 --> 24:55.438
You're firing me,

24:55.439 --> 24:56.500
but keeping Shaylee?

24:56.542 --> 24:58.042
Of course, she's a star.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.959
- What is this,
- your first job in TV?

25:00.584 --> 25:02.042
Yes!

25:02.083 --> 25:04.323
- And it should - have been my first
- Fruit basket, too!

25:05.083 --> 25:06.167
So, Jessie,

25:06.209 --> 25:07.543
what important new role

25:07.544 --> 25:08.876
did he give you?

25:08.918 --> 25:10.042
The corpse.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.000
- But the only lines
- the corpse has

25:12.042 --> 25:13.481
Are the chalk ones

25:13.482 --> 25:14.918
around it.

25:14.959 --> 25:16.001
Exactly. And when

25:16.002 --> 25:17.042
I brought that

25:14.959 --> 25:17.042
to his attention,

25:17.083 --> 25:18.083
he fired me.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.563
What?

25:19.564 --> 25:21.000
That's terrible.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.000
What can I do?

25:22.626 --> 25:23.834
You've done enough.

25:23.835 --> 25:25.042
Okay? Don't talk to me,

25:25.083 --> 25:27.324
- don't follow me, - and I never want
- To see you again.
