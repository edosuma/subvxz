00:04.004 --> 00:05.701
[indistinct sportscast over TV]

00:05.788 --> 00:06.832
What you watching?

00:06.919 --> 00:08.399
'86 Super Bowl.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.792
Bears are crushing the Pats.

00:09.879 --> 00:13.056
I'd have been happy
to die that day.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.102
Greatest four hours
and 22 minutes of my life.

00:15.189 --> 00:15.885
And I was at Woodstock.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.801
Move your feet.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.237
I don't want to;
just sit in the chair.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.760
But it's a bad angle.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.501
My neck will seize
by the fourth touchdown.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.199
[groans] My one day off,

00:25.286 --> 00:27.984
I can't even watch a
20-year-old football game.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.681
Mike, look.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.161
I got published.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.336
[chuckling]:
I actually got published.

00:32.423 --> 00:33.903
Oh, no way!

00:33.990 --> 00:36.471
And on the same day the
Bears beat the Pats.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.212
Vince, move.

00:38.299 --> 00:41.345
I'm gonna root
for the Pats, then.

00:41.432 --> 00:42.259
What's all the
yelling about?

00:42.346 --> 00:44.479
As of this moment,

00:44.566 --> 00:46.089
your daughter is
a published author. [chuckles]

00:46.176 --> 00:49.397
What?Molly, that is so exciting.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.660
Getting paid
for what you love to do.

00:51.747 --> 00:54.010
You and my dealer,
two of the lucky few.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.100
Well, it's just
a little article,

00:57.187 --> 00:59.320
you know, published
on a national blog.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.409
[chuckles]
JOYCE:
Wow.

01:01.496 --> 01:02.845
Sure shut up
all those people

01:02.932 --> 01:04.020
who never thought
you could do it.

01:04.107 --> 01:07.763
Who?Names aren't important.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.373
Well, I had my doubts myself.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.245
Sometimes I'd look at Mike
and just think,

01:11.332 --> 01:13.421
"Oh, you poor, sweet,
supportive fool.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.814
We are so screwed."

01:15.901 --> 01:17.077
Screwed? I thought you said
we were right on schedule.

01:17.164 --> 01:20.689
Well, we can laugh about it now.

01:20.776 --> 01:23.387
How much money
are we talking about?

01:23.474 --> 01:25.911
Not about the money;
it's about what it represents.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.262
Does is represent more than
the $3,800 you owe your mother?

01:28.349 --> 01:31.961
'Cause we'd like to take
a Carnival cruise this summer.

01:32.048 --> 01:34.833
You don't get
reimbursed monetarily.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.357
So squat.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.401
Yes, and I'm fine with that,

01:37.488 --> 01:40.012
because it's about exposure.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.841
Look at you, exposing
yourself on the Internet.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.713
JOYCE:
So, what's the
article about?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.628
Yeah, I'd like to read it.

01:46.715 --> 01:47.672
Or pretend to.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.371
You know, to be supportive.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.112
It's a little dry.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.504
I mean, I don't think anybody
here would be interested.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.941
"From toilet training
to tantrums.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.509
Understanding the
elderly parent."

01:58.596 --> 01:59.902
What the hell?!

01:59.989 --> 02:01.121
What if my friends see that?

02:01.208 --> 02:03.123
Don't worry about it.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.386
Old people can't even get
on the Internet.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.171
That's not true.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.955
Just last week, I helped
a prince from Nigeria

02:10.042 --> 02:12.001
track down his fortune.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.266
Listen, what do you say
we get all dolled up

02:16.353 --> 02:18.094
and I take you out
to lunch to celebrate?

02:18.181 --> 02:19.530
Oh, what about your day off

02:19.617 --> 02:20.836
and your goal
to not move an inch?

02:20.923 --> 02:24.709
[scoffs]
He already ruined that.

02:24.796 --> 02:27.016
Plus, it's not every day my
wife gets read by millions.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.671
Oh, well, I think
it's more like...

02:29.758 --> 02:31.281
[chuckling]:
45 people.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.717
Ooh, 46!

02:32.804 --> 02:34.066
You're welcome.

You couldn't take me to one

03:09.928 --> 03:11.713

to stick to the booth?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.497

That shut you up.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.374
Hey, look who's here.Hey.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.723
I thought you wanted
a day off from me,

03:21.810 --> 03:23.942
but look who came
crawling back.

03:24.029 --> 03:27.772
Molly got an article published,
so we decided to celebrate.

03:27.859 --> 03:28.817
Then why are you here?

03:28.904 --> 03:31.907
See? Even he knows it blows.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.561
Better than anyone.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.563
CARL:
A published author.
That's great.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.086
What is it, a book or a...?

03:37.173 --> 03:39.349
No, it's just a little article
on the Internet.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.090
Oh, the Internet.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.787
That's even better;
the whole world can see it.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.180
You know,
my one-arm push-up video

03:44.267 --> 03:45.964
has got a real following
in Bulgaria.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.753
You know, maybe we should've
gone someplace else.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.495
It doesn't pay anything,

03:54.582 --> 03:55.887
but I'm just happy
for the exposure.

03:55.974 --> 03:56.888
I mean, do you know
how many submissions

03:56.975 --> 03:58.020
that Web site gets?

03:58.107 --> 03:59.848
How many?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.893
I don't know, but a-a lot.

04:01.980 --> 04:05.462
And out of all those people,
they chose not to pay me.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.464
Oh, well, congratulations.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.553
Thank you, Carl.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.903
To think, two months ago,
I was a teacher,

04:11.990 --> 04:14.079
doing the same thing,
day after day,

04:14.166 --> 04:16.343
like a rat on a wheel.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.083
I wish the rats here
were on a wheel.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.607
It would make them
much easier to catch.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.087
Really?Oh, don't worry.

04:22.174 --> 04:23.480
The turkey meatballs
sell so fast,

04:23.567 --> 04:25.700
the rats can't
get near them.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.490
So, how would you like to spend

04:33.577 --> 04:35.405
the rest of our day
of celebration?

04:35.492 --> 04:36.798
And please don't
say martial arts movie,

04:36.885 --> 04:39.453
center row, third aisle,
large popcorn.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.584
Then why'd you even ask?

04:40.671 --> 04:42.456
I don't know.

04:42.543 --> 04:43.544
I really don't know.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.415
[gasps]
Ooh.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.938
Rolls-Royces.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.288
Beautiful, aren't they?

04:48.375 --> 04:50.377
You're talking
400 grand, easy.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.074
No way.
Yeah.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.728
When I was little, I had
a gray Hot Wheels one.

04:53.815 --> 04:54.772
Had its own driver.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.600
I would pretend I was him.

04:56.687 --> 04:57.601
Sailing down that orange track,
not a care in the world.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.603
Come on.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.649
Let's go in
and check it out.

05:01.736 --> 05:02.911
What? No.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.391
Why not?Because they'll know.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.566
Know what?

05:05.653 --> 05:07.568
That we don't belong in there.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.613
Oh, come on.
Can you just relax, fella?

05:09.700 --> 05:12.268
Can we just go in,
have some fun?

05:12.355 --> 05:13.182
Do something new?

05:13.269 --> 05:14.662
Come on, let's go in.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.011
No, you're gonna get us
in trouble.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.840
With who?The Rolls-Royce people!

05:18.927 --> 05:20.145
Mike, what are they gonna do?

05:20.232 --> 05:21.146
They can't take anything
from us.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.844
We don't have anything.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.628
Molly, do not
go in there.

05:24.715 --> 05:25.847
Molly!

05:25.934 --> 05:27.196
I'm not going in there.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.546
I'm going home.
I'm walking away.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.548
Bye.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.463
They're not gonna... [groans]

05:33.550 --> 05:35.422
Damn it!

05:36.684 --> 05:38.642
[classical music playing]

05:42.211 --> 05:43.865
What are you doing
standing there?

05:43.952 --> 05:46.128
Should I take my shoes off?

05:46.215 --> 05:48.173
[whispering]:
Just come over here.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.262
[sighs]

05:51.699 --> 05:53.962
How do they get them in here?

05:54.049 --> 05:55.572
It's like ships in a bottle.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.619
Do you smell that, huh?

05:58.706 --> 06:02.405
It's like we're inside
a James Bond movie.

06:02.492 --> 06:06.235
Leather and the metal
and the...

06:06.322 --> 06:07.845
turkey meatball?

06:07.932 --> 06:08.846
God, Mike!

06:08.933 --> 06:11.501
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.111
Can we go?No. We're looking around.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.636
For all they know,
we can afford one of these cars.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.855
Hey, you could have made a lot
of money on the Internet.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.553
You and I both know there's
no money in the Internet.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.468
That's not important.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.339
We can be anybody we want to be.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.993
Okay, it's all in
how you carry yourself.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.298
Just follow my lead.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.213
Have you done
this before?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.128
Not here.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.304
Hello. [chuckles]

06:32.392 --> 06:34.394
Hello.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.699
Can I help you?[in British accent]:
Oh, well, I hope so.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.788
We're quite interested

06:37.875 --> 06:39.007
in purchasing, uh, one
of your vehicles.[chuckles awkwardly]

06:39.094 --> 06:41.401
[laughs]
Oh, he's excited.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.359
Yes, crumb cake,
would you like

06:43.446 --> 06:44.882
to give this one
a test drive?[thumping]

06:44.969 --> 06:46.754
[laughs]

06:46.841 --> 06:47.929
Oh, I don't think so.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.365
I don't think he wants to.

06:49.452 --> 06:50.932
How about we give
that one a go, huh?

06:51.019 --> 06:53.413
Oh, yes, we have just
a bit of a tangle.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.024
We'd prefer to pay cash,
but we only have euros.

06:56.111 --> 06:59.027
Just gobs and
gobs of euros.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.726
I'll get the keys.Oh, brilliant!

07:02.813 --> 07:04.685
You'd prefer the four-door,
is that right, sir?

07:06.948 --> 07:10.168
[in bad British accent]:
Right, right.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.607
Oh, this is quite nice.

07:13.694 --> 07:16.740
Burled wood,
stitched leather,

07:16.827 --> 07:20.483
all the finest accoutrements.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.920
It also has a 12-cylinder
engine, 563 horsepower.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.662
Does zero to 60 in 4.2 seconds.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.403
I believe what the gentleman
is suggesting

07:27.490 --> 07:30.711
is that you stop driving
like the queen and give it a go.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.148
Right, right.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.976
Whoa.
Ooh-ooh!

07:35.063 --> 07:36.760
Ooh.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.849
Do you mind if I try the radio?

07:38.936 --> 07:39.981
Not at all.
It has dual controls

07:40.068 --> 07:41.635
for the front and the back.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.201
Oh, let's try the back.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.508
[classical music blaring]

07:45.595 --> 07:46.814
Is that too loud?

07:46.901 --> 07:48.119
Excuse me?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.033
[regular accent]:
Okay, we're good.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.078
Isn't this great?

07:50.165 --> 07:51.558
Are you having fun?

07:51.645 --> 07:53.037
Don't talk to me;
I'm trying to focus.

07:53.124 --> 07:53.777
Get off my ass, grandma.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.910
Go around!

07:55.997 --> 07:57.389
Oh, my God,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.870
there's a humidor
in the glove compartment.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.655
Oh, what a wonderful
waste of money.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.788
[sighs]
Put that thing away.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.530
I'm not gonna smoke it;
I'm just gonna take it.

08:07.617 --> 08:08.923
Molly!
I'm kidding.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.272
Can you just relax?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.491
No. I'm driving
the equivalent

08:11.578 --> 08:13.014
of a three-bedroom
house here,

08:13.101 --> 08:15.756
with a grandma who will
not get off my ass!

08:15.843 --> 08:17.801
You know, I-I made
your childhood dream

08:17.888 --> 08:20.674
of driving a Rolls-Royce
come true.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.066
You could at least enjoy it.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.285
I'm not built that way, Molly.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.373
You've met my mother.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.810
I wasn't raised to enjoy things.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.769
[sighs] You know,
you are taking all the fun

08:28.856 --> 08:31.815
out of this fraudulent
test drive.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.122
Just pull over here
in front of the hotel.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.080
Thank you.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.647
[music stops]

08:37.734 --> 08:38.909
[British accent]:
Do you have a longer model

08:38.996 --> 08:40.520
with a bubbly pool in the back?

08:40.607 --> 08:42.086
No.
Oh.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.914
Well, I wish you
would have told me that

08:44.001 --> 08:45.089
before we left the shop.

08:45.176 --> 08:48.440
Let's go, crumb cake.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.267
Let's go!

08:49.354 --> 08:50.660
Right, right.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.718
All right.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.112
Oh, excuse me.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.723
Sorry.

09:09.810 --> 09:13.161
Hey, uh, can just anybody sit
in those chairs?

09:13.248 --> 09:14.815
Yes, sir.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.643
Do you need help with anything?Uh, no.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.601
Just waiting for the wife.
She's hitting the head.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.734
Uh, the ladies' can.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.102
Hey, what took so long?

09:41.189 --> 09:42.843
That bathroom,
it's amazing.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.061
It's like a beauty parlor.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.454
They have everything.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.760
There was makeup and hair spray

09:46.847 --> 09:49.197
and perfume and...
Oh, look, mints.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.590
[chuckles]

09:50.677 --> 09:52.156
I thought you just had to pee.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.855
I did, and I enjoyed
every minute of it.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.770
The... the seats were heated.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.511
Are you sure somebody
just wasn't there before you?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
Oh, don't be gross. Not here.

10:03.907 --> 10:04.778
All right, so, uh,
you ready to go home?

10:04.865 --> 10:07.302
No. What's the hurry?

10:07.389 --> 10:08.912
Let's hang out. Ooh.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.914
We can pretend
that we're two strangers

10:11.001 --> 10:14.352
that just met in a hotel lobby.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.528
Well, you're already acting
like somebody I don't know,

10:16.616 --> 10:18.487
so we're halfway there.

10:18.574 --> 10:19.488
Perfect.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.446
Now all we need's a room.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.839
We can't afford
a room here.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.275
Even the people
we're pretending to be

10:24.362 --> 10:25.712
can't afford a room here.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.322
I know. This place
is horribly overpriced.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.933
[whispering]: That's why
we're not gonna pay for it.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.413
Come on.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.719
I'm a cop; I can't steal.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.678
We're not stealing.
We're borrowing.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.158
It's like a...
like a library book.

10:37.245 --> 10:40.378
Like a library book
we're gonna have sex on.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.471
All right, keep talking.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.908
This place has checkout
at 11:00.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.561
Check-in is at 3:00.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.128
Which means there's
a whole bunch of rooms upstairs

10:51.215 --> 10:53.304
just waiting
for turndown services.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.568
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.005
You're using sex as a weapon.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.267
You know that, right?

10:59.354 --> 11:00.572
Yes, I do. Come on.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.662
Let's go.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.754
[bell dings]

11:07.841 --> 11:09.843
Okay, perfect. Let's go.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.714
I'm a Chicago cop with
a gun on his ankle,

11:11.801 --> 11:13.063
and I'm shaking
like a leaf.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.499
It's the adrenaline.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.675
The metal taste
in the back of your mouth,

11:15.762 --> 11:17.415
it's how you know
you're alive.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.287
Who are you?

11:19.374 --> 11:20.767
Shh.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.290
All right, the maid's
almost done.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.074
Get the cart and go around
the corner with it.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.815
Why?Because you want
to have sex with me.

11:25.902 --> 11:26.642
Okay.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.776
Shh.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.784
[whispering]:
Go, go, go.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.525
Okay, when she comes out
and goes around the corner,

11:40.612 --> 11:41.613
we make a run for the
room and bolt the door.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.225
Have you done this before?

11:44.312 --> 11:46.967
Not here. Shh.

12:06.638 --> 12:07.727
All clear.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.729
I said "all clear."

12:09.816 --> 12:11.469
I'm a little wobbly.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.820
I still have my sex legs.

12:13.907 --> 12:17.693
You don't have to tell me,
Mr. 15 Minutes.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.913
The fear of that maid walking in
and seeing me naked

12:20.000 --> 12:22.263
bought me some extra time.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.655
MAN [over walkie-talkie]:
Check the 72nd floor.
Make sure all is clear.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.049
Security. I think
that maid ratted us out.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.137
Don't feel so good
about leaving the five

12:27.224 --> 12:28.878
on the pillow now, do you?

12:28.965 --> 12:30.358
What's next? You got
a plan for this?

12:30.445 --> 12:31.446
Yes. Give me your gun.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.013
What?
Yeah.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.710
You are not going
to shoot anyone.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.581
No. You're gonna
take me hostage.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.366
What is wrong with you?

12:38.453 --> 12:40.107
Just go to the stairs.Fine.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.152
But my way
would've worked, too.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.635
[giggling]:
Oh, my God.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.506
We'll just go down a floor,

12:48.593 --> 12:50.508
hop on the elevator,
and we are gone.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.554
You know, I think,
if I put my mind to it,

12:52.641 --> 12:54.338
I could rob a bank.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.775
Take it easy, Bonnie; this
is as far as Clyde goes.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.299
There's no handle.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.302
I guess you're supposed to put
your room key in the slot.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.259
Which we don't have.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.913
Why would they do that?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.221
To prevent people like us
from doing what we did.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.093
Oh, that's actually smart.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.791
What are you doing?

13:11.878 --> 13:14.097
Trying every card
in my wallet.
[chuckles]

13:14.184 --> 13:16.317
Well, I don't think that
your Orange Julius gift card

13:16.404 --> 13:19.059
is gonna save the day.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.844
It's either this
or walk down 71 flights.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.542
Okay, here, try my CVS card.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.807
That hostage thing doesn't look
so bad now, does it?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.551
[panting]

13:33.638 --> 13:34.291
MOLLY:
Whew.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.206
[chuckles]

13:36.293 --> 13:38.382
Ooh, this...

13:38.469 --> 13:40.210
This is quite a workout.

13:40.297 --> 13:40.820
Don't talk to me.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.822
Why?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.519
Because you're gonna
try to make this seem

13:44.606 --> 13:46.129
like we're having fun,
and we're not having fun.

13:46.216 --> 13:49.524
We're 40 floor from fun
with 30 more to go!

13:49.611 --> 13:51.047
Well, see?

13:51.134 --> 13:52.396
We're already halfway there.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.834
Do not look at
the bright side.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.053
There is no
bright side here!

13:57.140 --> 13:59.316
Oh, quit being such a crybaby.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.883
Don't call me a crybaby.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.365
[fake crying]:
Why? You gonna cry, crybaby?

14:04.452 --> 14:06.671
Stop it. If you hadn't dragged
me through all this crap,

14:06.758 --> 14:08.499
I'd be home, happy,
on my couch right now.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.111
But I was just trying to get you
to do something different.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.548
Get you out of your comfort zone
for half a day.

14:13.635 --> 14:14.375
You know what zone I'm in now?

14:14.462 --> 14:16.333
The chafing zone.

14:16.420 --> 14:20.033
I could cook a steak
between my thighs.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.686
Boy, for somebody
who drove a Rolls-Royce today

14:21.773 --> 14:25.081
and had sex
in a five-star hotel for free,

14:25.168 --> 14:26.735
you sure complain a lot.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.737
You know why you can't admit
this is miserable?

14:28.824 --> 14:30.391
Because you live in denial.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.175
That's why
you're so bad with money.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.003
Are you really gonna
point fingers, Groundhog Day?!

14:34.090 --> 14:36.310
I found you on the couch
this morning

14:36.397 --> 14:37.964
watching a 20-year-old
football game!

14:38.051 --> 14:41.402
I might have missed something!

14:41.489 --> 14:43.534
You know what,
I'll see you at the bottom.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.101
Yeah, you know what,
I'll see youat the bottom,

14:45.188 --> 14:46.450
'cause I'm going first!No, I'm going first.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.104
I got the rail.You move your hand.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.714
I got the rail! I got the rail!Move your hand.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.238
[screaming]

14:51.325 --> 14:53.240
Get moving, or I'll
give you the rail!

14:53.327 --> 14:55.285
Yeah, that's my...
[screams]

15:00.116 --> 15:02.075
[panting]

15:03.990 --> 15:05.948
MOLLY:
Mike?

15:08.733 --> 15:10.735
Mike!

15:13.521 --> 15:14.565
What are you doing?

15:14.652 --> 15:17.003
I was down in single digits.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.614
I'm sorry.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.745
That's it.

15:20.832 --> 15:21.921
I can't take another step.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.749
It's only 12 more floors.
Come on.

15:24.836 --> 15:25.576
I can't.

15:25.663 --> 15:26.490
Just leave me.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.145
Live your life.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.494
No.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.757
We walked into this together.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.020
We're walking out
of this together.

15:34.107 --> 15:37.501
I'm just holding you back.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.546
Okay.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.983
We can rest for a second.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.028
I'm not talking
about the stairs.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.595
I'm talking about in life.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.163
I'm just stopping you
from doing all that weird,

15:47.250 --> 15:49.992
wonderful stuff
that you want to do.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.690
Are you kidding?

15:52.777 --> 15:54.954
Mike, I-I couldn't have
done any of that stuff

15:55.041 --> 15:56.738
if it wasn't for you.

15:56.825 --> 15:59.393
That's not true.
It is.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.090
Mike, you're my rock.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.701
If it wasn't for you,

16:03.788 --> 16:06.400
I-I wouldn't have been
able to quit my job

16:06.487 --> 16:09.011
and become the successful,

16:09.098 --> 16:12.319
unpaid internet content
provider I am today.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.929
[laughs]

16:14.016 --> 16:15.539
[sniffles, sighs]

16:15.626 --> 16:18.542
Okay. Now, get up.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.718
Get up,
you exhausted son of a bitch.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.983
Come on.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.854
[groaning]

16:25.941 --> 16:27.073
[panting]

16:27.160 --> 16:28.074
If we don't get out of here,

16:28.161 --> 16:30.859
I love you, Molly.

16:30.946 --> 16:31.903
Then show me.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
Show me with your feet!

16:42.001 --> 16:44.742
[alarm blaring]

16:44.829 --> 16:46.788
We did it! We did it!

16:46.875 --> 16:49.051
Sweet baby Jesus,
we're alive!

16:49.138 --> 16:51.967
We're alive!

16:52.054 --> 16:54.013
[sighs]

16:54.100 --> 16:56.580
[alarm continues]

16:56.667 --> 16:58.626
Act like we belong.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.283
Oh, apples!

17:07.678 --> 17:09.071
Thank you. We...

17:09.158 --> 17:11.073
We had a lovely stay.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.344
[sighs]

17:21.431 --> 17:22.476
Come on.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.173
Let's get you to the couch.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.696
[groans]

17:25.783 --> 17:27.698
Can you bring the couch
closer to me?

17:27.785 --> 17:29.787
Come on, honey,
you can do it.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.528
Come on.

17:31.615 --> 17:32.747
Three steps and a flop.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.967
[laughs, groans]

17:36.055 --> 17:38.057
Oh!

17:38.144 --> 17:39.667
[groaning]

17:39.754 --> 17:42.235
Oh, this is comfortable.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.759
Now I know why you never want
to get off of it.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.195
See?

17:46.282 --> 17:47.675
Welcome to Mike Biggs country.

17:47.762 --> 17:50.330
Kind of nice, huh?

17:50.417 --> 17:52.593
Better than a Rolls.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.073
[sighs]

17:54.160 --> 17:55.987
Thank you, Molly.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.598
For what?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.208
Pushing me.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.731
Oh, hey, is that the stairs?

18:00.818 --> 18:02.385
I told you I tripped.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.300
My feet were numb.

18:04.387 --> 18:04.953
[chuckles] No.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.563
[giggles]

18:06.650 --> 18:08.739
For putting
together this day.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.438
Making me do things that...

18:11.525 --> 18:14.093
I-I never thought I would do.

Well, you better get used to it.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.532
I don't know
where I'm going next,

18:18.619 --> 18:20.751
but I'm taking you with me.

18:20.838 --> 18:24.581
Can we at least wait
until my thighs heal

18:24.668 --> 18:29.195
and my ankles go back
to being smaller than my calves?

18:29.282 --> 18:33.460
Well, we can't go Jet Skiing
until the summer anyway.
