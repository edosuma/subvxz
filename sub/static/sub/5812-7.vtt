WEBVTT

00:05.165 --> 00:06.731
(elevator bell dings)

00:11.471 --> 00:13.471
So we're really
gonna stay.

00:13.473 --> 00:16.007
Well, you know
what Paris does to me.

00:16.009 --> 00:17.275
Dior, Lagerfeld.

00:17.277 --> 00:19.077
You should see
their ateliers.

00:19.079 --> 00:20.611
I want mine
to be right here.

00:20.613 --> 00:22.113
This place inspires me.

00:22.115 --> 00:23.114
Is that okay
with you?

00:23.116 --> 00:24.115
Yeah.

00:24.117 --> 00:25.483
I made some friends.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.120
What would you think
if I told you

00:29.122 --> 00:31.089
that me and my blonde
lady friend are gonna

00:31.091 --> 00:32.323
be together forever?

00:32.325 --> 00:33.925
I thought you liked men?

00:33.927 --> 00:35.093
(chuckles nervously)

00:36.930 --> 00:38.930
Well, adults are complicated.

00:38.932 --> 00:40.999
Then I approve.

00:42.202 --> 00:43.701
Mr. Drake.

00:43.703 --> 00:45.570
I think we've got a problem.

00:47.540 --> 00:48.940
It's one-inch steel.

00:48.942 --> 00:50.708
It runs the whole length
of this section.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.010
It's not in any
of the plans.

00:52.012 --> 00:53.011
Tear it out.

00:53.013 --> 00:54.078
I'm on a schedule.

01:02.155 --> 01:03.521
MAN:
It smells like shit in there.

01:03.523 --> 01:05.123
MAN 2:
No, it smells like death.

01:08.561 --> 01:10.294
(scoffs)

01:27.981 --> 01:30.515
I don't think we
should go down there.

01:30.517 --> 01:32.016
(mimicking):
"Eh, it smells like death."

01:32.018 --> 01:33.017
(laughs)

01:33.019 --> 01:34.485
Come on, you pussy.

01:34.487 --> 01:37.055
This place has been
sealed up for years.

01:40.093 --> 01:41.259
(shouts)

01:41.261 --> 01:42.627

02:28.374 --> 02:30.808
¶ ¶

03:05.578 --> 03:06.911
WOMAN:
Do you know where you are?

03:06.913 --> 03:08.913
JOHN:
California.

03:08.915 --> 03:10.982
Which hospital?

03:12.919 --> 03:15.920
Mr. Lowe, you're at the West
Los Angeles Health Center.

03:15.922 --> 03:17.855
I'd like to ask
you some questions

03:17.857 --> 03:20.658
to determine your
state of mind.

03:20.660 --> 03:25.196
Could you start by counting
backwards from 100 by sevens?

03:25.198 --> 03:28.199
Uh, 93...

03:28.201 --> 03:31.202
86...

03:31.204 --> 03:33.271
seventy... seventy-nine....

03:35.475 --> 03:37.475
Uh, what was
the last one I said?

03:37.477 --> 03:40.278
Tell me which statement
most accurately describes

03:40.280 --> 03:41.512
what you're feeling.

03:43.116 --> 03:46.250
"I am not discouraged
about my future."

03:48.955 --> 03:52.223
Are you sure you want
to stay here?

03:52.225 --> 03:56.294
I mean, there are
more comfortable places, John.

03:56.296 --> 03:58.529
I could get you
into Resnick.

03:58.531 --> 04:01.132
This is perfect for me.

04:04.404 --> 04:08.172
In your own words,
can you tell me why you're here?

04:08.174 --> 04:12.543
I, um, feel like everything's
closing in on me.

04:12.545 --> 04:16.514
Some setbacks
at work.

04:16.516 --> 04:18.583
Separation from my wife.

04:21.521 --> 04:25.056
Because of a misunderstanding,

04:25.058 --> 04:27.124
my daughter is afraid of me.

04:29.429 --> 04:31.495
I need professional help.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.267
I think that's a very
important statement.

04:36.269 --> 04:38.769
The fact that you recognized
your own fragility

04:38.771 --> 04:40.338
and took positive action.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.539
Was there
a specific incident

04:41.541 --> 04:43.241
that prompted
this latest episode?

04:43.243 --> 04:45.343
JOHN:<i> I've been working</i>
<i> on a very frustrating case.</i>

04:45.345 --> 04:47.278
<i> There's a killer out there,</i>
<i> murdering with impunity,</i>

04:47.280 --> 04:51.249
<i> using the Ten Commandments</i>
<i> as justification.</i>

04:51.251 --> 04:54.752
Hey, dickhead, you're
on administrative leave.

04:54.754 --> 04:57.355
Captain sees you here, you won't
even get your old job back.

04:57.357 --> 04:59.223
Who's the suspect?

04:59.225 --> 05:01.225
I'm not covering
for you anymore.

05:01.227 --> 05:03.294
JOHN:
I want to talk to him.

05:03.296 --> 05:05.663
Where is he?

05:08.935 --> 05:12.003
JOHN: I attacked
the only friend I had.

05:13.973 --> 05:16.274
The one person who was
trying to help me.

05:16.276 --> 05:19.277
And that's when you finally
realized you needed help.

05:19.279 --> 05:20.845
Get some fresh air.

05:22.382 --> 05:23.481
You better be
out of here, asshole!

05:24.984 --> 05:26.851
Okay, I'm going.

05:31.591 --> 05:35.226
I knew it was time
I checked into a hospital.

05:35.228 --> 05:38.262
We'll get a handle
on this, John.

05:38.264 --> 05:41.299
This is a good first step.

05:44.237 --> 05:47.505
I feel I'm exactly
where I need to be.

05:47.507 --> 05:50.374
¶ ¶

05:52.945 --> 05:54.745
Does Mr. Drake
know about this?

05:54.747 --> 05:56.247
Um, I don't think so.

05:56.249 --> 05:58.015
He's, um, he's in the middle

05:58.017 --> 06:00.451
of getting his anus
waxed and bleached.

06:00.453 --> 06:03.187
Is that a
thing now?

06:03.189 --> 06:04.455
I mean, how would
someone even know

06:04.457 --> 06:05.990
their anus needs
bleaching?

06:05.992 --> 06:08.059
I couldn't pick my butthole
out of a lineup.

06:12.865 --> 06:14.865
Who did this?

06:14.867 --> 06:16.667
Not the new governess.

06:16.669 --> 06:18.202
No.

06:18.204 --> 06:19.670
I mean, look at 'em.

06:19.672 --> 06:22.340
Whoever did this was starving.

06:22.342 --> 06:24.308
What was in here?

06:24.310 --> 06:26.043
I don't know.

06:28.614 --> 06:30.414
What?

06:31.884 --> 06:34.518
I've just never seen
you scared before.

06:46.499 --> 06:49.033
I convinced him I got him
a fantastic deal,

06:49.035 --> 06:52.837
so he threw a free weekend
on top of my commission.

06:52.839 --> 06:54.372
(chuckles)

06:54.374 --> 06:56.140
Don't tell him that
I fudged the paperwork

06:56.142 --> 06:57.675
to make it look like
he had multiple offers.

06:57.677 --> 06:59.877
Oh, honey.

06:59.879 --> 07:02.313
I'd rather be alone.

07:02.315 --> 07:04.915
You know, ever since
I had to put Hallie down,

07:04.917 --> 07:07.485
I go through
these spasms of grief.

07:07.487 --> 07:09.820
(knocking)
Oh, there's the room service.

07:09.822 --> 07:11.422
Bye, Margaret.

07:11.424 --> 07:13.491
I hate that bitch.

07:13.493 --> 07:14.592
(knocking)

07:14.594 --> 07:16.093
All right!

07:16.095 --> 07:18.329
I'm coming.
For God's sake...

07:18.331 --> 07:21.532
Aah!

07:21.534 --> 07:25.236
(grunting, slurping)

07:25.238 --> 07:27.304
(gasping)

07:30.076 --> 07:31.242
An eye for an eye.

07:31.244 --> 07:32.510
A tooth for a tooth!

07:32.512 --> 07:35.179
That is the law of my father!
(gasps)

07:35.181 --> 07:37.448
You belong to the sheik!

07:37.450 --> 07:39.450
And cut. Good,
let's do one more.

07:39.452 --> 07:42.086
(bell rings)
(indistinct conversations)

07:42.088 --> 07:44.622
My God, he is

07:44.624 --> 07:46.957
so beautiful.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.459
WOMAN:
My boyfriend says he's queer.

07:48.461 --> 07:51.695
Gibby. He's married

07:51.697 --> 07:53.731
to Natacha Rambova,

07:53.733 --> 07:55.866
one of the most exotic
women in the whole world.

07:55.868 --> 07:59.270
They're getting a divorce.
Don't you read<i> Picture Play?</i>

07:59.272 --> 08:00.771
And her name's not Rambova.

08:00.773 --> 08:02.640
It's Winifred Hudnut.

08:02.642 --> 08:04.275
And she's from Utah.

08:04.277 --> 08:06.410
So what?
That just

08:06.412 --> 08:08.579
makes me admire her
more. She

08:08.581 --> 08:11.315
transformed herself.
The only thing
she transformed is his career.

08:11.317 --> 08:12.783
She ruined it.

08:14.954 --> 08:17.555
Okay, people.
Slavers and harem concubines--

08:17.557 --> 08:20.391
you're up.

08:20.393 --> 08:22.626
This is for you.
From him.

08:50.590 --> 08:54.258
<i>Bellissima.</i> Mm.

08:56.429 --> 08:58.996
You came.

08:58.998 --> 09:01.065
Please.

09:03.703 --> 09:06.537
I am so pleased
you agreed to join me.
(Italian song playing)

09:06.539 --> 09:08.038
You see, I...

09:08.040 --> 09:10.774
I often must
dine alone.

09:10.776 --> 09:12.209
You?
Mm.

09:12.211 --> 09:13.544
That's hard to believe.

09:13.546 --> 09:16.447
Well, it's not simple
for me, you know?

09:16.449 --> 09:19.350
Fame is its own kind

09:19.352 --> 09:21.418
of, uh, prison.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.722
Please.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.796
(speaks Italian)

09:34.834 --> 09:36.467
It's a wonderful face.

09:36.469 --> 09:39.203
(gasps)
You speak Italian!

09:39.205 --> 09:41.038
Well, I understand it, anyway.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.673
I'm from Bensonhurst.

09:42.675 --> 09:44.808
Italian's
all my folks talked

09:44.810 --> 09:47.411
when I was growing up.
Pop's from Sicily.

09:47.413 --> 09:48.812
He's a plumber.
Mm.

09:48.814 --> 09:51.081
And you have come to Hollywood

09:51.083 --> 09:53.918
with dreams of becoming
an actress.

09:56.856 --> 09:59.690
That is unfortunate.

09:59.692 --> 10:03.460
I think I see
greater things in you.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.899
Greater than being immortal?

10:08.901 --> 10:12.436
'Cause that's what it means
to be up on that screen.

10:12.438 --> 10:15.706
Shadows only.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.409
A hundred years and no one

10:18.411 --> 10:19.577
will remember what we did.

10:19.579 --> 10:20.878
No, I don't agree.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.515
I don't
agree at all.

10:24.517 --> 10:28.352
I think the flickers
are the future.

10:28.354 --> 10:31.355
A true American art form.

10:31.357 --> 10:32.590
(soft laugh)

10:33.926 --> 10:37.628
<i> You</i> are a true
American art form.

10:37.630 --> 10:39.296
Are you making fun of me?

10:39.298 --> 10:42.132
No, no, no, little one.

10:42.134 --> 10:45.302
I am, uh... admiring you.

10:45.304 --> 10:47.071
I'm sorry. If it
seems otherwise,

10:47.073 --> 10:48.872
it is only because...

10:48.874 --> 10:52.309
my English is not so good, huh?
(chuckles)

10:52.311 --> 10:53.944
(song ends)

11:03.556 --> 11:05.556
(tango playing)
I do better

11:05.558 --> 11:06.724

That I was divorcing
my husband.

And so I am.

12:20.633 --> 12:21.799
I sh...

Natacha...

12:31.143 --> 12:33.877
you must be gentle
with our guest, huh?

12:35.047 --> 12:37.247
The divorce is for show.

12:37.249 --> 12:39.483
The studio has
been trying to...

12:39.485 --> 12:41.485
tear us apart
for years.

12:41.487 --> 12:42.920
We have decided
the only way

12:42.922 --> 12:45.155
we can really be
together is if...

12:45.157 --> 12:47.825
the world thinks
we are not.

12:47.827 --> 12:50.260
I don't understand.

12:50.262 --> 12:52.563
Why am I here?

12:52.565 --> 12:54.331
Because, little mouse...

I hear he's not only

and handsome,
so far as that goes.

14:03.903 --> 14:06.670
How'd you meet
this guy, anyway?
I haven't met him yet.

14:06.672 --> 14:08.739
There isn't a flapper in this
city who hasn't been invited

14:08.741 --> 14:11.074
to one of his private wingdings.
You'd know that

14:11.076 --> 14:13.944

out of circulation all summer.

14:13.946 --> 14:15.779

Nobody.

can't all

14:44.109 --> 14:45.609
enjoy these libations

14:45.611 --> 14:48.946
in my new
Blue Parrot Lounge,<i> but...</i>

14:48.948 --> 14:52.382

repeals that nasty

14:52.384 --> 14:54.051
Volstead Act,

14:54.053 --> 14:56.887
both I and Mr. Capone

14:56.889 --> 14:59.756
will have to make due.

15:04.163 --> 15:05.863
Ah!

15:08.567 --> 15:11.001
MAN:
He's dead!

15:11.003 --> 15:12.803
Valentino's dead.

15:12.805 --> 15:15.005
He died in New York
this morning.

15:15.007 --> 15:17.307
And his movie
just came out.

15:17.309 --> 15:20.410

Let me go!

16:01.587 --> 16:03.954
(breathing quiets)

16:03.956 --> 16:07.391
No. I don't suppose I will.

tragic.

16:44.897 --> 16:46.897
I guess
we missed her.

16:46.899 --> 16:48.398
Who?

16:48.400 --> 16:49.967
The Lady in Black.

16:49.969 --> 16:52.469
She's been coming here
for months every day

16:52.471 --> 16:54.471
and leaving a single red rose.

16:54.473 --> 16:56.473
I thought that was a myth.

16:56.475 --> 16:58.175
No, it's true.

16:58.177 --> 17:00.711
It says so right here.

17:02.848 --> 17:05.482
"Rumors have sprung up
of a mysterious figure

17:05.484 --> 17:07.317

"Some say the veiled figure

17:22.501 --> 17:24.935
Harlot.
She never loved him.

"Others believed the wordless
visitor is something else...

17:29.341 --> 17:32.676
something not of this Earth."
(laughs softly)

17:32.678 --> 17:35.312
Well, they'll print
anything to sell magazines.

17:35.314 --> 17:38.749
Uh... ladies?

(footsteps echoing)

17:44.023 --> 17:45.288
(pants)

17:45.290 --> 17:48.058
Maybe we should give
her her privacy.

little mouse?

Natacha.
Where have<i> you</i> been?

18:10.883 --> 18:12.716
Here and there.

18:12.718 --> 18:16.386
I wrote to you, so many times--
I never heard back.

18:16.388 --> 18:19.523
You didn't even come
to his funeral.

18:19.525 --> 18:23.060
Why would I go to the funeral
of a man who isn't dead?

18:27.166 --> 18:29.099
(Countess gasps)

Bellisima.

(gasping breaths)

18:39.011 --> 18:40.777
It can't be true.

18:40.779 --> 18:42.379
You died.

18:42.381 --> 18:44.181
And am...

18:44.183 --> 18:46.416
reborn.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.919
The body in that crypt
isn't Rudy.

18:48.921 --> 18:52.222
It's my stunt double,
George Fiske.

18:52.224 --> 18:54.758
(kiss)
Always so loyal.
Even in death.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.427
Though to be clear,
I did do most of my own stunts.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.795
Just not this one.

18:58.797 --> 19:00.397
You faked your death?!

19:00.399 --> 19:02.365
I loved you both.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.534
And you just let me
think the worst?

19:04.536 --> 19:05.936
I almost didn't
survive it.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.137
But you did
survive.

19:07.139 --> 19:09.106
And in some style.

19:09.108 --> 19:12.309
Congratulations
on the nuptials,
by the way.

19:12.311 --> 19:14.811

That was quick.

Uh...

20:08.634 --> 20:11.334
Who is he?

20:12.304 --> 20:14.538
Just a hobo.

20:17.042 --> 20:19.209
You disapprove?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.079
I do.

20:24.483 --> 20:28.118
Why waste your time killing
some destitute beggar?

20:28.120 --> 20:29.319
What's to
be gained?

20:29.321 --> 20:32.222
Select a victim with
money or jewels.

20:32.224 --> 20:34.824
Then your little hobby
can benefit us both.

20:34.826 --> 20:36.259
And next time...

20:39.298 --> 20:41.831
(whispers):
...I want to watch.

20:41.833 --> 20:44.067
You have suffered
too much.

20:44.069 --> 20:46.903

20:46.905 --> 20:49.206
I don't suffer.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.710
Not anymore.
Your tears
tell me otherwise.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.579
I feel nothing.

20:57.216 --> 21:01.318
We never meant to leave you
this way, little one.

21:04.423 --> 21:07.057
Then why did you?

21:07.059 --> 21:09.559
VALENTINO:
<i> Fate intervened.</i>

21:09.561 --> 21:11.194
<i> I was travelling the country,</i>

21:11.196 --> 21:13.330
<i> promoting</i> Son of the Sheik.

21:13.332 --> 21:15.565
<i> Booked</i>
<i> on the</i> 20th Century Limited,

21:15.567 --> 21:18.935
<i> the tour would take me</i>
<i>from San Francisco to New York,</i>

21:18.937 --> 21:21.238
<i> with press stops</i>
<i> all along the way.</i>

21:21.240 --> 21:25.775
<i> At each stop, I began</i>
<i> to notice a man. At first,</i>

21:25.777 --> 21:27.344
<i> I thought he was a member</i>
<i> of the press,</i>

21:27.346 --> 21:29.112
<i> but he never asked</i>
<i> any questions,</i>

21:29.114 --> 21:32.115
<i> never wrote anything down.</i>
<i> He just watched me,</i>

21:32.117 --> 21:34.517
<i> his eyes never leaving me.</i>

21:34.519 --> 21:35.785
<i> This was not unusual,</i>
<i> of course.</i>

21:35.787 --> 21:37.787
<i> But something in those eyes...</i>

21:37.789 --> 21:40.223
<i> mesmerizing.</i>

21:40.225 --> 21:42.359

21:42.361 --> 21:44.928
<i> Again on the train,</i>
<i> I began to feel a presence</i>

21:44.930 --> 21:47.430
<i> which raised the hairs</i>
<i> on the back of my neck.</i>

21:51.236 --> 21:53.203
<i> I imagined I was seeing him</i>

21:53.205 --> 21:54.971
<i> all throughout the train.</i>

21:56.775 --> 22:01.378
<i> I began to doubt my senses.</i>

22:01.380 --> 22:04.381
<i>A feeling of dread hung over me</i>
<i> like a shroud.</i>

22:04.383 --> 22:06.149
<i> And somewhere,</i>

22:06.151 --> 22:09.319
<i> along an endless expanse</i>
<i> of Midwest plains,</i>

22:09.321 --> 22:14.391
<i> I woke from a dreamless sleep</i>
<i> into a dream itself.</i>

22:14.393 --> 22:19.329
<i> It was a seduction, but</i>
<i>mere carnality was not his aim.</i>

22:19.331 --> 22:22.432
<i> I was repelled and drawn in</i>
<i> all at once.</i>

22:22.434 --> 22:24.501
<i> When he spoke,</i>
<i> it was in Italian</i>

22:24.503 --> 22:27.070
<i>but with a thick German accent.</i>

22:27.072 --> 22:30.840
<i> He revealed to me his name,</i>
<i> F.W. Murnau,</i>

22:30.842 --> 22:34.077
<i> the great German director.</i>

22:34.079 --> 22:36.079
What did he want from you?

22:36.081 --> 22:38.982
I thought he meant
to kill me.

22:38.984 --> 22:42.252
But instead he wished
to preserve me.

22:42.254 --> 22:43.853
I don't
understand.

22:43.855 --> 22:45.655
Neither did I, at first.

22:45.657 --> 22:48.358
The great director
had uncovered many secrets

22:48.360 --> 22:52.295
in the making
of his masterpiece,<i> Nosferatu.</i>

22:52.297 --> 22:54.597
To make his picture,
he travelled deep

22:54.599 --> 22:57.300
into the Carpathian Mountains.

22:57.302 --> 22:59.669
He demanded authenticity,

22:59.671 --> 23:03.673
and that is what he found
in that Old World.

23:03.675 --> 23:06.876
<i> Creatures like the one</i>
<i> he was depicting onscreen,</i>

23:06.878 --> 23:09.779
<i> though not hideous</i>
<i> like his star, Max Schreck,</i>

23:09.781 --> 23:12.615
<i> but beautiful beyond compare.</i>

23:12.617 --> 23:15.352
<i> Infected</i>
<i> with an ancient blood virus,</i>

23:15.354 --> 23:18.655
<i> the consequence of which</i>
<i> was eternal life,</i>

23:18.657 --> 23:20.657
<i> endless youth.</i>

23:20.659 --> 23:23.993
<i> But also a terrible thirst.</i>

23:23.995 --> 23:26.863
<i> He was telling me all this,</i>
<i> he said, as a prelude,</i>

23:26.865 --> 23:31.000
<i> a prelude to a warning</i>
<i> and the offer of a gift.</i>

23:31.002 --> 23:35.205
<i> Murnau lamented to me</i>
<i> what he foresees,</i>

23:35.207 --> 23:37.474
<i>the coming of talking pictures.</i>

23:37.476 --> 23:41.044
<i> And with that,</i>
<i> the death of the gods.</i>

23:41.046 --> 23:45.482
<i> Within a year, no more,</i>
<i> our world would be gone.</i>

23:45.484 --> 23:48.418
<i> He couldn't save the world,</i>
<i> he said, but he could save me,</i>

23:48.420 --> 23:51.688
<i> preserve my beauty</i>
<i> for all eternity,</i>

23:51.690 --> 23:54.491
<i> but only if I was ready</i>
<i> to leave the screen.</i>

23:54.493 --> 23:55.658
<i> Forever.</i>

23:55.660 --> 23:58.428
<i> And so, with a cool touch,</i>

23:58.430 --> 24:01.498
<i> and a warm kiss,</i>
<i> I was truly free.</i>

24:01.500 --> 24:04.401
<i> Immortal.</i>
<i> No longer just a shadow.</i>

24:04.403 --> 24:05.902
When I arrived
in New York,

24:05.904 --> 24:08.438
the press reported
that I had fallen ill.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.241
I let them believe it,
knowing the reports

24:11.243 --> 24:15.111
were all I would need to have
Natacha fly to my side.

24:15.113 --> 24:18.515
When she
came to me,

24:18.517 --> 24:22.452
I shared with her the dark gift
Murnau had given to me.

24:22.454 --> 24:25.088
And now we want
to share it with you.

24:25.090 --> 24:28.057
Come away
with us.

24:28.059 --> 24:30.460
There's a train that leaves
tomorrow night to New York.

24:30.462 --> 24:32.729
From there, to Europe. Anywhere.

24:32.731 --> 24:34.130
Everywhere.

24:40.472 --> 24:43.740
(panting)

24:43.742 --> 24:46.743
Yes.

24:46.745 --> 24:48.978
Yes...

24:48.980 --> 24:52.048
and forever.

24:53.084 --> 24:55.618
(moaning)

24:57.556 --> 24:58.588
I missed you.

24:58.590 --> 25:01.191
(panting, moaning)

25:20.579 --> 25:22.512
MAN:
You hear the one
about the tongue?

25:22.514 --> 25:25.448
Cut out of the victim's head
with a hacksaw,

25:25.450 --> 25:27.450
then nailed to the floor
with a hammer.

25:27.452 --> 25:29.152
While she was alive.

25:29.154 --> 25:30.420
You're freaking me out.

25:30.422 --> 25:32.755
That monster is here,
right behind that door?

25:34.426 --> 25:36.426
What kind of psycho thinks
of that shit?

25:36.428 --> 25:38.361
Much less do it.

25:38.363 --> 25:41.598
And they only have
one guard at the door?

25:41.600 --> 25:45.468
I'm plenty enough
for anything.
(chuckles)

25:45.470 --> 25:46.836
You better pay
attention to that door,

25:46.838 --> 25:48.705
make sure nothing
bad comes out.

25:54.446 --> 25:57.113
(crickets chirping)

26:11.062 --> 26:13.530
(moans)

26:13.532 --> 26:15.732
(clattering)

26:15.734 --> 26:17.567
Hey, man, you okay?

26:31.082 --> 26:33.883
(beeping)

26:44.996 --> 26:47.830
(muffled crying, shouting)

27:02.847 --> 27:05.415
(muffled crying, shouting)

27:23.702 --> 27:25.602
Who are you?

27:25.604 --> 27:28.371
I'm Wren.

27:36.247 --> 27:37.914
You didn't eat your dinner.

27:37.916 --> 27:39.816
WREN:
I'm not hungry for that.

27:39.818 --> 27:42.318
They can get you something else.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.622
I don't want to feed anymore.

27:50.562 --> 27:53.129
Why did they put
you in here, Wren?

27:53.131 --> 27:55.665
Because I wouldn't talk to them.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.934
The police officer?

27:57.936 --> 28:00.536
Detective Hahn.

28:10.482 --> 28:13.082
They found you
at the TV station.

28:13.084 --> 28:15.485
You saw what
happened.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.587
I helped.

28:17.589 --> 28:21.424
You must have been terrified.

28:21.426 --> 28:22.992
The man
you saw

28:22.994 --> 28:25.995
has done a lot of bad things.

28:25.997 --> 28:30.800
Ugly, scary things.

28:30.802 --> 28:34.137
But you don't have to be afraid
of him anymore.

28:34.139 --> 28:36.639
Do you
believe that?

28:36.641 --> 28:38.808
I do.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.844
But nobody forced me
to do anything.

28:45.383 --> 28:48.785
(grunting)

28:48.787 --> 28:51.220
Oh, sweet Jesus.

28:51.222 --> 28:53.389
WREN:
Don't.

28:59.631 --> 29:00.863
(grunts)

29:04.135 --> 29:06.135
Wren.

29:06.137 --> 29:09.539
You killed the security guard.

29:09.541 --> 29:11.708
He was going to catch him.

29:15.647 --> 29:20.650
I want to know
we can trust each other, Wren.

29:20.652 --> 29:24.120
I won't lie to you.

29:26.057 --> 29:29.392
Can you promise the same to me?

29:29.394 --> 29:33.196
I was there the other times.

29:33.198 --> 29:36.265
<i> When he nailed their tongues</i>
<i> to the table.</i>

29:36.267 --> 29:39.001
When he hung the brothers
from the beds.

29:39.003 --> 29:42.238
He cut open their stomachs.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.841
It stunk.

29:44.843 --> 29:48.444
Now do you believe me?

29:49.848 --> 29:52.348
You were there.

29:55.954 --> 29:59.756
But whatever he made you do,

29:59.758 --> 30:04.460
whatever you think you did...

30:04.462 --> 30:06.329
he's responsible.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.466
It's not your fault.

30:10.468 --> 30:13.736
It is my fault.

30:13.738 --> 30:15.872
Everything that happened.

30:15.874 --> 30:17.106
Please,

30:17.108 --> 30:20.109
don't say that.

30:20.111 --> 30:23.880
You sound exactly
like my daughter Scarlett.

30:23.882 --> 30:27.784
She's around your age, but she's
the oldest little girl I know.

30:27.786 --> 30:29.786
I think deep down
she blames herself

30:29.788 --> 30:32.688
for everything
that's wrong with me.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.894
But it's me,

30:37.896 --> 30:40.429
not her.

30:40.431 --> 30:43.232
And it's him,

30:43.234 --> 30:45.902
not you.

30:45.904 --> 30:48.404
I like you.

30:50.341 --> 30:53.409
You're nothing like my father.

30:55.914 --> 30:57.914
When I was young,

30:57.916 --> 31:02.218
my daddy told me he couldn't
wait for me to grow up.

31:06.457 --> 31:10.927
He told me I was gonna be
his little lady.

31:12.931 --> 31:15.498
The way he said it,

31:15.500 --> 31:17.767
it made my stomach hurt.

31:17.769 --> 31:21.537
It got so I didn't want
to sleep,

31:21.539 --> 31:24.473
<i> 'cause every time I woke up</i>
<i> I was a day closer.</i>

31:24.475 --> 31:26.475
<i> One day he left me in a car</i>

31:26.477 --> 31:30.546
<i> while he went drinking</i>
<i> at the Cortez.</i>

31:37.822 --> 31:42.158
<i> It was so crazy hot.</i>

31:42.160 --> 31:44.994
<i>I was like a pizza in the oven.</i>

31:44.996 --> 31:47.964
<i> But I didn't open the window,</i>
<i> and I didn't say a word,</i>

31:47.966 --> 31:49.799
<i> because I thought</i>

31:49.801 --> 31:52.635
<i> maybe there was a way</i>
<i> I didn't have to grow up.</i>

31:52.637 --> 31:54.770
(screams, panting)

31:58.009 --> 32:00.343
<i> But I found another way.</i>

32:00.345 --> 32:03.012
Now I think maybe growing up
wouldn't have been so bad.

32:03.014 --> 32:05.815
It can't be worse than this.

32:05.817 --> 32:07.350
Wren, I don't understand.

32:07.352 --> 32:09.518
Are you telling me
it's your father?

32:09.520 --> 32:10.987
He's the killer?

32:10.989 --> 32:13.222
No. He died a long time ago.

32:13.224 --> 32:15.558
I'm just... I'm so sick
of this whole thing.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.026
I don't want it anymore.

32:17.028 --> 32:18.361
Then let it go.

32:18.363 --> 32:20.730
Tell me who he is.
I can't.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.031
Why are you protecting someone

32:22.033 --> 32:23.566
who doesn't deserve anything
from you?

32:23.568 --> 32:24.567
You wouldn't believe me.

32:24.569 --> 32:25.935
He's going to keep

32:25.937 --> 32:28.571
killing people unless
you help me stop him.

32:28.573 --> 32:31.007
Get me out of here, and
I'll show you where he lives.

32:31.009 --> 32:33.409
We're not playing
a game here, Wren.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.611
Maybe it's time
he got caught.

32:47.625 --> 32:50.626
(loud panting)

32:50.628 --> 32:52.428
I'm finally beginning

32:52.430 --> 32:54.463
to feel the life
return to me.

32:54.465 --> 32:56.032
(loud, wheezy breathing)

32:56.034 --> 32:58.267
(loud breathing)

32:58.269 --> 33:00.803
How do I look?

33:00.805 --> 33:02.204
Terrible.

33:02.206 --> 33:04.040
(breathing loudly)

33:04.042 --> 33:06.943
You're being dramatic.

33:06.945 --> 33:09.412
VALENTINO:
That was little better
than the rats.

33:09.414 --> 33:11.981
We need more.

33:11.983 --> 33:13.282
(gasps)
Oh.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.818
A hundred times more.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.219
(swallows loudly)

33:17.221 --> 33:18.988
This thirst--

33:18.990 --> 33:20.890
it's unslakable.

33:20.892 --> 33:22.959
Oh.

33:22.961 --> 33:25.461
Son of a bitch!

33:25.463 --> 33:28.164
How long have we been
trapped in this place?

33:28.166 --> 33:30.967
Aah. Too long.

33:30.969 --> 33:36.005
I am going...
to rip that man's head off.

33:36.007 --> 33:39.075
I imagine that
he is long dead.

33:39.077 --> 33:43.012
And in truth, you are as much
to blame for our predicament.

33:43.014 --> 33:45.648
You and your little mouse.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.116
She had no part in this.

33:47.118 --> 33:48.985
We didn't need her.

33:48.987 --> 33:51.821
We had money.
We had the world.

33:51.823 --> 33:53.956
Life everlasting.

33:53.958 --> 33:55.758
But you craved your pet.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.327
Was she worth it?!

33:58.329 --> 34:00.830
Look at us!

34:00.832 --> 34:02.932
"The Great Lover,"

34:02.934 --> 34:07.103
that magnificent face
that women lusted after,

34:07.105 --> 34:12.108
killed themselves over, reduced
to a grotesque monstrosity.

34:12.110 --> 34:14.944
Our lives stolen!

34:14.946 --> 34:17.446
Everything gone.

34:17.448 --> 34:20.149
You are right.

34:20.151 --> 34:22.685
Forgive me, amore.

34:22.687 --> 34:25.121
I was foolish.

34:25.123 --> 34:30.659
I promise, we will reclaim
all that we have lost.

34:30.661 --> 34:33.162
You are dreaming.
You will see.

34:33.164 --> 34:35.664
Our life will be
far more glorious

34:35.666 --> 34:38.367
than it ever was before.

34:38.369 --> 34:41.737
(doorknob clicks, rattles)

34:41.739 --> 34:43.506
MAN (with Australian accent):
Wrong room, asshole!

34:43.508 --> 34:46.142
Dude, those book club
ladies were all over me.

34:46.144 --> 34:48.144
Did you see that
redhead lick my balls?

34:48.146 --> 34:49.578
You're so full of shit.

34:49.580 --> 34:52.148
The hell?
There's only one bed.

34:52.150 --> 34:53.983
I'm not sharing a room
with one of you cumsicles.

34:53.985 --> 34:55.684
Ah...
You're sleeping
on the floor.

34:55.686 --> 34:58.454
Strippers always get
the shittiest rooms, huh?

34:59.757 --> 35:02.191
What curious creatures.

35:02.193 --> 35:05.027
Like the Colossus
come to life.

35:05.029 --> 35:08.731
The gush of their
blood is deafening.

35:08.733 --> 35:12.334
Who are we to deny a gift
from the gods?

35:12.336 --> 35:14.904
(panting)

35:20.111 --> 35:22.178
Oh.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.946
MS. EVERS:
Surely the Wellington

35:23.948 --> 35:26.248
is getting cold, Mr. March.

35:27.185 --> 35:29.819
Hardly a concern, Ms. Evers.

35:37.195 --> 35:40.262
(rhythmic squeaking)

35:42.200 --> 35:44.934
(piano plays intro
to "Isn't It Romantic?")

35:44.936 --> 35:47.203
(fingers snap)
Perhaps your guest
should be mindful

35:47.205 --> 35:49.572
of the time she's expected.

35:49.574 --> 35:51.207
I don't believe

35:51.209 --> 35:53.042
I care for your tone, Ms. Evers.

35:53.044 --> 35:55.311
The lady of the house
deserves more respect.

35:55.313 --> 35:56.779
Yes, Mr. March.

35:56.781 --> 35:58.214
(knocking)

35:58.216 --> 36:00.549
You should be elsewhere.

36:00.551 --> 36:03.619
(band plays instrumental version
of "Isn't It Romantic?")

36:04.555 --> 36:06.122
Dearest!

36:06.124 --> 36:08.457
Thank you for seeing me tonight,
James.

36:08.459 --> 36:10.226
I know it's a week early.

36:10.228 --> 36:12.094
Mm. Nonsense.

36:12.096 --> 36:14.563
I'd be delighted to host our
meal on any night you choose.

36:14.565 --> 36:16.665
We could have it nightly
instead of monthly.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.267
Just say the word.

36:18.269 --> 36:20.169
Once a month, James.

36:20.171 --> 36:22.404
That's our arrangement.

36:22.406 --> 36:24.473
I'm far too busy
for anything more.

36:24.475 --> 36:26.075
Of course.

36:26.077 --> 36:27.776
Would you like
an Armagnac?

36:27.778 --> 36:30.246
I'm having one.
No, thank you.

36:46.931 --> 36:49.165
Yes?

36:49.167 --> 36:52.801
I wanted to tell you in person.

36:52.803 --> 36:55.337
I plan to marry again.

36:56.374 --> 36:59.108
Splendid!

36:59.110 --> 37:01.277
Why, I couldn't be
more pleased.

37:01.279 --> 37:03.279
Let's have a toast, shall we?

37:03.281 --> 37:05.281
Who's the lucky fellow?

37:05.283 --> 37:08.284
I'd like
to send him some steaks.

37:08.286 --> 37:10.152
Will Drake.

37:10.154 --> 37:12.388
Ah, yes.

37:12.390 --> 37:14.490
That light-in-the-loafers

37:14.492 --> 37:16.325
fellow that bought my hotel.

37:16.327 --> 37:18.294
Very good, darling.
Very good.

37:18.296 --> 37:20.129
Might I suggest
that when you murder him,

37:20.131 --> 37:21.864
you do so off the property?

37:21.866 --> 37:23.332
It'd be damned awkward

37:23.334 --> 37:25.034
to keep running into him
for all eternity.

37:25.036 --> 37:27.336
And what makes you think
I mean to do him harm?

37:27.338 --> 37:31.240
I'm dead, dear. Not stupid.

37:31.242 --> 37:35.211
And how do you know
I haven't found love?

37:35.213 --> 37:39.148
True love maybe
for the very first time.

37:39.150 --> 37:42.985
Surely not for the first time,

37:42.987 --> 37:45.354
Mrs. March.

37:45.356 --> 37:49.725
I've always been scrupulously
honest with you, James.

37:49.727 --> 37:54.330
I never pretended
more than I felt.

37:54.332 --> 37:57.333
And I never claimed to love you.

37:57.335 --> 37:59.235
Yes.

38:01.339 --> 38:04.740
(sighing):
Oh.

38:14.719 --> 38:17.920
But then, I wasn't
referring to myself now,

38:17.922 --> 38:20.522
was I?

38:20.524 --> 38:23.359
What do you mean?

38:28.766 --> 38:32.268
I thought I could
make you love me.

38:32.270 --> 38:34.603
I thought if I
gave you everything

38:34.605 --> 38:37.306
your little heart desired--

38:37.308 --> 38:41.410
riches, comfort...

38:41.412 --> 38:45.214
this hotel--

38:45.216 --> 38:47.850
but none of it moved you.

38:51.389 --> 38:53.922
I could never compete
with the shadow of a god

38:53.924 --> 38:55.991
on a screen, 20 feet tall!

38:55.993 --> 38:57.993
(man grunting, woman screams)

38:57.995 --> 38:59.595
(coughing)
No, let him go!

38:59.597 --> 39:01.497
Let her go!
Let him go!

39:01.499 --> 39:02.498
(grunting)

39:02.500 --> 39:06.402
I have a sneaking suspicion

39:06.404 --> 39:08.637
you're going to miss your train.

39:08.639 --> 39:10.072
(grunt)

39:10.074 --> 39:12.374
(train bell clanging,
train chugging)

39:20.318 --> 39:23.952
(inhales and exhales deeply)

39:23.954 --> 39:26.488
(breathing loudly)

39:34.465 --> 39:37.066
Oh.

39:40.304 --> 39:42.604
Oh.

39:44.275 --> 39:48.010
Rudy?

39:48.012 --> 39:51.480
Where are we?

39:51.482 --> 39:53.849
(groans)

40:22.413 --> 40:24.546
(hitting walls)

40:27.885 --> 40:31.553
(yelling)
(screaming)

40:37.495 --> 40:39.795
(distant yelling)

40:47.438 --> 40:50.005
(tool tapping bricks)

40:52.877 --> 40:55.444
Oh, my God.

40:59.717 --> 41:02.251
Yes.

41:02.253 --> 41:04.420
Your god.

41:04.422 --> 41:09.057
Trapped within the walls
of the palace I built

41:09.059 --> 41:11.760
for my queen.

41:13.097 --> 41:17.299
(yelling):
That's what was back there?!

41:17.301 --> 41:19.835
Not... anymore.

41:40.991 --> 41:43.792
All right.

41:43.794 --> 41:46.395
Go.

41:58.409 --> 42:00.142
(grunts)

42:00.144 --> 42:01.910
All right, I got you out.

42:01.912 --> 42:04.413
Now you take me to him.

42:04.415 --> 42:05.814
Wren...

42:05.816 --> 42:07.516
Then we need to go home.

42:07.518 --> 42:08.750
Where?

42:08.752 --> 42:10.385
The Cortez.

42:12.156 --> 42:13.622
All right, don't be afraid.

42:13.624 --> 42:15.257
When I find him,
I'm gonna bury him

42:15.259 --> 42:17.493
in a hole so deep, he'll
never see the light of day.

42:17.495 --> 42:19.995
It's time to
make him stop.

42:19.997 --> 42:22.531
Will you kill him?

42:22.533 --> 42:24.633
If I have to.

42:24.635 --> 42:26.635
I really like you.

42:26.637 --> 42:30.439
I hate to see it end.

42:31.642 --> 42:34.209
Good-bye, John.

42:34.211 --> 42:35.944
Wren!

42:35.946 --> 42:38.747
(tires screech)
No!
