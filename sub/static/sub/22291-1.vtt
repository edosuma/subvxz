00:43.244 --> 00:44.078
- Oh, yes.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.281
- Yes, harder, harder.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.864
Yes, yes, harder,
harder, harder, harder.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.823
Look at my eyes.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.592
Look in my eyes, yes.

01:37.265 --> 01:40.534
Harder.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.739
Look at me.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.575
Where are you going?

01:47.575 --> 01:49.377
Where are you going?

01:49.377 --> 01:51.645
- There's something out there.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.547
- Don't forget
you're on the clock.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.848
- Who's out there?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.267
* Love is greedy

04:27.267 --> 04:29.537
* Love is rough

04:29.537 --> 04:31.905
* Love is needy

04:31.905 --> 04:33.707
* Love is tough

04:33.707 --> 04:37.144
* So you gotta be strong

04:38.312 --> 04:41.482
* You gotta be strong

04:43.551 --> 04:45.853
* Love takes courage

04:45.853 --> 04:48.221
* Love breaks hearts

04:48.221 --> 04:50.558
* Love will perish

04:50.558 --> 04:52.526
* And tear you apart

04:52.526 --> 04:54.928
* You gotta be strong

04:54.928 --> 04:56.797
* Oh, oh

04:56.797 --> 05:00.434
* Yeah, you gotta be strong

05:01.835 --> 05:06.273
* When your love shine
me, I glow, I glow

05:06.273 --> 05:11.044
* There's a whole lot of
colors you need to know

05:11.044 --> 05:15.649
* If you wanna
get inside my head

05:15.649 --> 05:18.352
* And if you wanna love me

05:18.352 --> 05:22.222
* You must have bled

05:22.222 --> 05:24.224
* Every shade of red

05:41.341 --> 05:42.610
- Kenny, Kenny.

05:45.579 --> 05:49.182
- Yo, Professor, what's with
the two next to my name?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.350
Honestly, you know
how many girls tell me

05:50.350 --> 05:51.585
I'm a solid eight?

05:53.320 --> 05:55.556
- Your mom and sister
don't count, Kenny.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.126
The numbers represent
the amount of points

05:59.126 --> 06:01.194
you all need in order
to pass my class.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.362
- Oh, hell no.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.833
- Irving, if you insist on
showing no sense of humor

06:05.833 --> 06:07.300
in my class,

06:07.300 --> 06:11.038
I'm gonna have to rethink
that A plus you almost earned.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.276
Now hear me out before
you all rejoice.

06:16.276 --> 06:19.680
I have decided to drop
next week's final exam.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.251
Where do you think you're going?

06:24.251 --> 06:25.352
- But you just said that--

06:25.352 --> 06:26.554
- Sit down, Blake.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.321
I know for a fact
that baseball practice

06:28.321 --> 06:31.859
doesn't start for at
least a few hours.

06:31.859 --> 06:35.195
I have decided instead
to assign you all

06:35.195 --> 06:36.864
a group project.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.200
That's what the
numbers represent.

06:41.469 --> 06:44.071
Listen up, there is a
method to my madness.

07:00.387 --> 07:04.958
Any history teacher can make
you memorize purported facts,

07:04.958 --> 07:06.760
but if there's only
one thing I hope

07:06.760 --> 07:10.531
you take away from
my class, it's this.

07:10.531 --> 07:14.434
History is simply the
winner's interpretation

07:14.434 --> 07:17.404
of the events that transpired.

07:17.404 --> 07:20.240
I want each group to
look deeper than that

07:20.240 --> 07:23.176
and rediscover a
moment in history.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.986
Isabella Cruz has
decided to grace us

07:32.986 --> 07:35.656
with her presence,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.325
To what do we owe this pleasure?

07:39.927 --> 07:42.395
- I'm in your class.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.764
- I know that.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.999
I'm only surprised that you do.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.001
Your name isn't on the board,

07:48.001 --> 07:51.104
but you will be in group two.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.306
- You're seriously putting
her in group two with me?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.809
- Yes, I am, Blair, seriously.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.947
Now this project counts
for 50% of your grade,

07:59.947 --> 08:01.849
so don't screw it up.

08:01.849 --> 08:05.018
I expect at least 20 typed
pages from each group

08:05.018 --> 08:06.920
by the end of next week,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.189
and to answer Irving's
next question,

08:09.189 --> 08:12.926
yes, each group
will share a grade,

08:12.926 --> 08:15.028
so you better learn
to work together.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.740
- I don't even get what
she means recreate history.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.676
- She didn't say to
recreate history, Blair.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.510
She said to rediscover it.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.011
Trust me, as a black man,

08:32.011 --> 08:35.816
I wouldn't wanna recreate any
history around these parts.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.821
- What did I miss?

08:40.821 --> 08:43.390
- We're rediscovering
history, Chrissy.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.792
What do you say me and you

08:44.792 --> 08:46.760
get a jump on that
tonight, Kamasutra style?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.195
- Who's the Kamasutra?

08:48.195 --> 08:49.863
- Put that down.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.898
Guys, we gotta figure this out.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.965
I got practice.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.567
I can't be here all day.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.804
- Well, we can't start without
our honorary sixth member.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.806
Why'd you pick up her books
earlier today, anyway?

08:58.806 --> 08:59.940
- Yeah,
she's so weird.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.174
- Yeah.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.109
- Well, if she's
not gonna show up,

09:02.109 --> 09:03.410
she's not gonna share my grade.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.779
- Has anyone actually
ever even talked to her?

09:05.779 --> 09:06.714
I mean, I heard that she lives

09:06.714 --> 09:07.948
with that crazy cat lady,

09:07.948 --> 09:09.717
the one who never
leaves her farm.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.884
- I heard they were lovers.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.119
- Oh.

09:12.119 --> 09:12.920
- That's my kind of
nasty right there.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.854
I'd be into that.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.022
You know what I'm talking about.

09:15.022 --> 09:15.856
Yup.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.359
- My daddy told me to
never talk to that woman.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.360
I heard that when she was a kid,

09:20.360 --> 09:22.029
she had black eyes

09:22.029 --> 09:24.097
'cause her parents
like worshiped the
devil or something.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.466
That's why she allowed
in town anymore.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.235
- Sh, here she comes.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.772
- No one actually believes that.

09:36.844 --> 09:40.848
- So Blake, you want me
to walk you to practice?

09:43.884 --> 09:44.718
Blake?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.555
Blake.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.259
- What are you doing here?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.962
- You disappeared after class.

11:34.962 --> 11:35.896
- This is private property.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.364
You're gonna get me in trouble.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.431
- I'm sorry.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.502
- Just--

11:42.502 --> 11:43.370
- Where are you taking me?

11:43.370 --> 11:44.537
- Get in here.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.707
Get in there.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.543
Don't say a word.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.879
Don't even move.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.247
Just stay down.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.691
- I tell ya.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.629
Those coyotes killed two more
of my chickens last night.

12:09.629 --> 12:13.000
I believe we need to
build a bigger fence.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.534
- Oh no.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.635
- You alright?

12:15.635 --> 12:17.370
You seem nervous.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.539
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:19.539 --> 12:23.276
I just, I know how you
feel about the animals.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.444
I'll put out more coyote traps.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.779
I promise, Mama.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.415
- Finish your chores yet?

12:28.415 --> 12:29.649
- Almost.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.583
- Alright, well,
when you're done,

12:30.583 --> 12:31.651
I want you to wrap Brady's leg.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.187
It's swelling up in this heat.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.255
- Yes, ma'am.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.492
- Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.961
- Oh, I'll get it.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.664
- Are you sure you didn't
forget your medicine?

12:47.968 --> 12:48.802
- Ow.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.505
- What is that?

12:53.673 --> 12:55.075
You have company?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.483
Oh, you do have company.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.688
My, my, my, Blake Simpson,

13:08.688 --> 13:10.323
you certainly have
filled out nicely

13:10.323 --> 13:12.425
since the last time I saw you.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.693
How's your mama?

13:13.693 --> 13:14.527
- She's fine.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.662
Thanks, ma'am.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.497
- You appear to be bleeding.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.431
I'm sorry.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.533
My cat is afraid of strangers.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.468
Aren't you, darling?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.970
Come here, baby.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.172
What'd you do?

13:26.006 --> 13:26.840
Oh.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.677
Isabella, where
are your manners?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.414
- Absolutely, you're right.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.917
I have a first aid kit inside.

13:40.921 --> 13:41.754
- Yeah.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.177
- So you gonna tell
me why you freaked out

14:04.177 --> 14:05.612
when I showed up?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.017
I guess that's a no.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.359
- It's a tiny scratch.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.696
How do you know my mom, anyway?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.998
- Oh, we go way back.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.166
- Oh, is that so?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.700
- Oh yeah.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.237
You don't remember, do you?

14:30.237 --> 14:32.072
I saw you the day you moved in.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.606
I helped move all the
furniture into the barn

14:33.606 --> 14:35.642
so you'd have
somewhere to sleep.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.678
- That was a scary day for me.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.413
- I'm glad it was your thing.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.949
I usually make a better
first impression,

14:41.949 --> 14:43.816
thought maybe I was
losing my touch.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.523
So what happened to
your real parents?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.125
Still talk to them?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.629
- That's enough
with the questions.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.333
I gotta get back to work.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.170
- Hey, you know
you're in my group.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.004
Wait.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.008
We're meeting tomorrow at
seven in the school library.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.944
I can pick you up if you want.

15:10.944 --> 15:11.945
- It's okay.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.181
I'll be there.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.351
- Alright, Willy Manning.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.455
- Who?

16:28.455 --> 16:31.258
- 1976, the young
African American man

16:31.258 --> 16:33.826
was unjustly imprisoned
for the murder

16:33.826 --> 16:36.696
of two white college
kids up in Kenesaw.

16:36.696 --> 16:40.067
- How do you know he
wasn't justly imprisoned?

16:40.067 --> 16:42.235
- Other than being a
black man in the South?

16:42.235 --> 16:45.705
- You'd make a
terrible lawyer, Irving.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.108
- I get why you always
isolate yourself.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.942
- Hey, what about you?

16:50.943 --> 16:52.545
You haven't said a single word.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.681
Do you have any ideas?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.584
- I haven't thought
of anything yet.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.818
- Surprise, surprise,

16:58.818 --> 17:00.920
weird girl doesn't
have any ideas.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.290
Bet it's really hard for
her to read English, y'all.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.660
- Here's an idea.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.128
Let's do it on your
father's company

17:09.128 --> 17:10.297
and how he threw 50 people

17:10.297 --> 17:12.765
of low economic stature
out of their homes

17:12.765 --> 17:14.101
to build a mall,

17:15.435 --> 17:19.339
or would that be a conflict
of interest for you?

17:21.007 --> 17:22.275
- Got it.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.777
Okay, have you guys ever heard

17:25.944 --> 17:27.680
of the werewolf
of Talbot County?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.450
- Where's Talbot County?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.051
- It's about 50 miles from here,

17:32.051 --> 17:33.553
and the grave is still there.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.189
- Woah, sorry, the
grave of the werewolf?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.857
- Stop messing with her, Kenny.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.627
- Actually, I've heard of this.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.894
Can I see that?

17:43.263 --> 17:47.367
- So in 1848, a bunch
of local residents

17:47.367 --> 17:49.869
were complaining about
their sheep being killed,

17:49.869 --> 17:52.004
whole flocks slaughtered,

17:52.004 --> 17:53.340
but never eaten,

17:53.340 --> 17:54.274
so whatever was killing them

17:54.274 --> 17:56.576
was just doing it for fun.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.678
After a while, a couple
farmers got together,

17:58.678 --> 18:02.215
and they put an ad in
the Atlanta newspaper

18:02.215 --> 18:03.983
looking for a bounty
hunter to kill, you know,

18:03.983 --> 18:07.254
whatever animal was
responsible for it.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.257
- Sorry, we have a chance

18:10.257 --> 18:13.893
to free an innocent
man from prison,

18:13.893 --> 18:16.396
and you're talking
about ghost stories.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.831
- Well, okay, so one, it's
not a ghost story, Irving.

18:18.831 --> 18:19.866
It's a werewolf story.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.067
Please pay attention.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.469
Two, this shit
actually happened.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.470
There's the ad right there

18:23.470 --> 18:26.139
if anyone wants to peruse it.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.740
He said he shot
it a couple times,

18:27.740 --> 18:30.610
but never actually killed it.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.679
It didn't take long
for this guy to realize

18:32.679 --> 18:34.314
he wasn't dealing
with just any animal,

18:34.314 --> 18:38.485
so one night he melted a
silver cross into a bullet,

18:39.586 --> 18:40.920
went out into the field to kill

18:40.920 --> 18:44.056
what he believed was a werewolf,

18:44.056 --> 18:45.825
but when he shot it,

18:45.825 --> 18:49.662
all he heard was the
screams of a dying woman.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.999
- So it was a girl werewolf?

18:52.999 --> 18:53.933
- Well, this is where the story

18:53.933 --> 18:55.968
gets a little bit interesting.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.238
He never found any werewolf,

18:58.238 --> 18:59.839
only a severed human hand.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.107
- Shit.

19:01.107 --> 19:01.908
- I don't
wanna hear any more.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.610
- No, let him finish.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.045
- So years later, this
doctor was talking

19:06.045 --> 19:07.680
to the bounty hunter,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.816
and he said the same night

19:09.816 --> 19:12.285
this guy shot a werewolf,

19:12.285 --> 19:15.121
a young girl by the name
of Emily Burt came in

19:15.121 --> 19:17.890
to be treated for
a missing hand.

19:19.326 --> 19:23.230
The family denied anything
ever happened to Emily.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.332
- So what happened to the girl?

19:25.332 --> 19:28.835
- Well, she was never
seen in town again.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.537
Years later after she died,

19:30.537 --> 19:34.374
she was buried on land that
the Burts still own today.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.075
I mean, they won't let
anyone near the grave.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.810
- If we can't get in,

19:39.779 --> 19:43.082
how are we supposed to
write a 20 page paper

19:43.082 --> 19:44.517
about if it's real or not?

19:44.517 --> 19:45.685
- That's an excellent
question, Irving.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.953
I'm really glad you asked that

19:46.953 --> 19:48.388
because this is where we
got a little bit lucky.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.290
That crazy bitch
that she works for,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.559
her farm borders on
the Burt's property.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.526
- Don't call her that.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.927
She's got a name.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.729
- He's right.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.564
It does.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.400
- Look, I say we
rent some horses

20:00.400 --> 20:02.068
and get to the Burt's
property that way.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.936
That's just my idea.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.538
- Let's vote on it.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.174
Raise your hand if you think

20:08.174 --> 20:10.810
that our paper should be
about freeing an innocent man

20:10.810 --> 20:12.078
from death row,

20:13.346 --> 20:16.949
or finding out if teen
wolf is real or not.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.120
- Love the system, but
we got even number here.

20:21.120 --> 20:21.954
There's six of us.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.122
What if there's a tie?

20:23.122 --> 20:24.223
- Then we throw out both ideas

20:24.223 --> 20:25.558
and find something else.

20:25.558 --> 20:29.329
- Alright, raise your
hand for innocent man.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.530
- Chrissy.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.231
- I don't wanna go
into the woods, Blair.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.102
- Let's find Emily Burt.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.505
- I'll go into the
woods with you, Blake.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.096
- Day one, and shit
is getting real.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.833
It's hot as balls out,

22:46.833 --> 22:50.803
and we're officially
in werewolf country.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.472
Chrissy is looking very sexy

22:52.472 --> 22:54.140
in a sweaty kind of way.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.709
- Nice, Kenny, will
you stop shooting me?

22:56.709 --> 22:57.777
- It's very
tasteful, Chrissy.

22:57.777 --> 22:58.611
I promise.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.049
Isabelle is looking very sexy

23:03.049 --> 23:07.053
in a very free kind
of way.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.387
If only these woods could talk.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.858
- Kenny, can you put out
that fucking joint, man?

23:11.858 --> 23:12.692
- No.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.362
- Alright, Kenny, which way?

23:16.362 --> 23:17.697
- Uh, hold on.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.132
- Great, now we're
taking directions

23:20.132 --> 23:21.768
from Cheech Spielberg.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.770
Kenny, give me the fucking
teen wolf map, man.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.705
You finish smoking your dope.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.373
- You're gonna get us
arrested with that shit.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.676
- There's no cops in
the woods, John Wayne.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.478
You can chill out.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.079
- Why did you bring a gun?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.714
We have food.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.617
- Not safe to sleep in the
woods without protection.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.551
I've been living out here

23:38.551 --> 23:40.219
a lot longer than you have.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.420
- I like it.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.388
- Alright, we're
gonna take a right.

23:42.388 --> 23:43.656
We're headed west.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.458
- Alright.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.292
Let's go.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.661
- I brought a tent
big enough for two.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.196
- Oh, thank God.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.499
Looks like we don't have to
share a tent anymore, Kenny.

23:52.499 --> 23:53.600
- All I'm saying
is there's way more

23:53.600 --> 23:55.001
available sex in my tent.

23:55.001 --> 23:55.835
That's it.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.504
- Good Lord.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.138
- I only got a sleeping bag.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.272
- That's okay.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.674
You can have my tent.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.342
Kenny's got room for two.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.311
- Oh, come on, dude.

24:05.311 --> 24:06.779
You're killing me right now.

24:07.747 --> 24:12.051
* My world was going under

24:12.051 --> 24:14.821
* I needed love

24:14.821 --> 24:17.657
* But got a doctor

24:17.657 --> 24:20.326
* I'm outta control

24:20.326 --> 24:23.395
* I'm outta control

24:23.395 --> 24:27.567
* He gave me pills
to forget I missed ya

24:28.935 --> 24:31.671
* You take some more

24:31.671 --> 24:34.440
* And you'll be better

24:34.440 --> 24:37.309
* And I'm outta control

24:37.309 --> 24:40.212
* I'm outta control

24:40.212 --> 24:42.915
* They say I've
got one, two, three

24:42.915 --> 24:45.685
* Some kind of ABC

24:45.685 --> 24:49.355
* But that's all part of me

24:49.355 --> 24:51.691
* Hey, there's
pills for that too

24:51.691 --> 24:54.761
* There's pills for heartache

24:54.761 --> 24:57.864
* There's pills to
fall in love too

24:57.864 --> 25:00.767
* Go ahead, take a picture

25:00.767 --> 25:03.536
* I might as well be a statue

25:03.536 --> 25:05.404
* A tourist attraction

25:07.139 --> 25:08.808
- They heard scratching,

25:08.808 --> 25:11.343
so they got in their
car and drove off.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.014
Then when he walking
her back from her door,

25:16.148 --> 25:18.985
he saw a hook in
the roof of his car.

25:21.888 --> 25:25.491
- And let me guess,
the killer was there.

25:25.491 --> 25:26.726
Oh my God.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.027
- You know, I heard
this story before,

25:28.027 --> 25:29.696
but in the version I heard,

25:29.696 --> 25:32.398
the girl he took home
was the serial killer.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.034
Yeah.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.270
Fill me up, Kenny.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.441
- You getting pretty wasted
off that Sprite, Irving?

25:42.441 --> 25:43.910
- Yeah, you guys laugh it up,

25:43.910 --> 25:45.878
but while you cats are
in the Betty Ford clinic,

25:45.878 --> 25:48.180
I'll have already
made my first million.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.115
- Yeah, you hang out with a lot

25:49.115 --> 25:50.817
of sober millionaires, Irving?

25:50.817 --> 25:52.351
Does anybody else need a drink?

25:52.351 --> 25:53.853
- I do.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.622
- I'll make you
something special.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.956
- I'm not old enough
to drink, silly,

25:56.956 --> 25:58.490
so no funny business.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.760
- Stop trying to corrupt
my pledge, Kenny.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.895
- I was always told
to follow my heart.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.012
- You doing okay?

26:35.561 --> 26:36.796
- A bit for me,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.069
and a little bit for you.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.414
Here you go, Chrissy.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.016
- Thank you, Kenny.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.921
- I like the Sprite
on you, Kenny.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.289
- Sorry.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.891
- Gonna get me
another drink, bro?

27:04.891 --> 27:06.158
- Here, have mine.

27:06.158 --> 27:06.859
- No, I'll get you
another one, man.

27:06.859 --> 27:07.794
It's no problem.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.128
- No, don't worry about it.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.362
I wasn't really thirsty.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.431
Blair just wanted
to mess with Kenny.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.033
- That's fucked up, Blair.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.537
- I have a story.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.774
- Oh, this'll be good.

27:23.609 --> 27:24.576
- Come on, Blair.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.345
I know you can be nice.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.680
- Really, Blake?

27:28.647 --> 27:29.581
- You done?

27:31.183 --> 27:32.118
Okay, well,

27:35.387 --> 27:37.489
there was this couple.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.758
They were madly in love,

27:38.758 --> 27:40.927
so they wanted to have kids.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.494
- Yeah, that's novel.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.430
- That's not the story.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.634
Like most men, he
wanted to have a son,

27:48.634 --> 27:50.569
you know, carry on his name.

27:50.569 --> 27:52.171
- Uh, such a man.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.875
- Unfortunately for
the husband, however,

27:55.875 --> 27:57.376
a daughter was born,

27:57.376 --> 27:59.145
but despite his disappointment,

27:59.145 --> 28:03.249
the wife hoped he'd grow
to love their little girl,

28:04.951 --> 28:06.452
but over the years,

28:06.452 --> 28:10.589
the couple actually grew
further and further apart,

28:10.589 --> 28:14.761
and one summer, for the little
girl's eleventh birthday,

28:16.295 --> 28:18.264
the mother planned
a camping trip

28:18.264 --> 28:21.500
to try and reunite the family.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.302
- That's a dumb
woman right there.

28:25.772 --> 28:28.474
- Their first
night in the woods,

28:28.474 --> 28:31.143
something unimaginable happened.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.281
- They had like a really
solid family camping trip?

28:35.281 --> 28:37.049
- Should I finish?

28:37.049 --> 28:37.884
- Sorry.

28:40.152 --> 28:43.089
- That same night,
their daughter awoke

28:43.089 --> 28:44.690
from her nightmare.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.493
She was sweating and crying.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.896
She tried to open up her tent

28:51.330 --> 28:54.200
when a noise startled her.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.269
It sounded like
a pack of wolves.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.205
The noise was so loud

28:59.205 --> 29:01.507
she thought it could be
right outside her tent,

29:01.507 --> 29:02.975
so she ran back inside,

29:02.975 --> 29:07.413
and she cried and cried
and cried herself to sleep.

29:09.615 --> 29:10.716
Next morning,

29:12.785 --> 29:15.287
she called out for her mother,

29:16.222 --> 29:18.490
didn't get a response.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.060
- They were dead, weren't they?

29:22.795 --> 29:25.297
- She walked into
her parents' tent

29:25.297 --> 29:27.699
and found their intestines
decorated around

29:27.699 --> 29:29.435
like Jack the Ripper
was still alive.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.004
Their eyes were literally
cut out of their sockets

29:32.004 --> 29:34.340
and placed into their hands.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.743
- The killer had to be white.

29:37.743 --> 29:40.279
There's no way a black man
would even do that shit.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.548
- Here we go again.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.384
- What if the killer
was the little girl?

29:45.384 --> 29:47.219
- That doesn't make any sense.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.822
Why would a little
girl kill her parents?

29:49.822 --> 29:51.323
- I don't know, man.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.625
Nothing really
makes any sense anymore.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.761
Everybody's wild now.

29:57.229 --> 30:00.766
- Actually, they never found
who committed the crime.

30:03.502 --> 30:07.106
Some people did say
it was her daughter.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.909
- So what happened to her?

30:09.909 --> 30:12.344
- The state had her
committed to a mental ward

30:12.344 --> 30:13.712
and within six months,

30:13.712 --> 30:15.948
she hung herself.

30:17.283 --> 30:21.020
Some say her ghost still
haunts the very woods

30:21.020 --> 30:24.090
we're camping in right now,

30:24.090 --> 30:27.193
and if you hear loud howling,

30:27.193 --> 30:30.562
it's her coming to seek revenge

30:30.562 --> 30:32.498
for her parents' death.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.939
- You aright, Irving?

30:39.939 --> 30:41.007
It's just a ghost story.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.109
- I'm good.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.411
I just need to get
some fresh air.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.446
- Oh, man, you're outside.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.747
This is as fresh
as the air gets.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.351
- Should I go with him?

30:52.351 --> 30:53.685
I don't think he should
be just walking around

30:53.685 --> 30:56.055
in the woods alone.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.556
- Irving's a big boy.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.458
He can take a walk by himself.

31:33.926 --> 31:34.760
- Shit.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.072
Jesus fucking Christ.

31:53.845 --> 31:54.880
- Irving, you okay?

31:54.880 --> 31:56.582
- I just saw a raccoon.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.084
- You're scared of a raccoon?

31:58.084 --> 32:00.819
- No, no, no, there's
something out there, man.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.589
- Did you pee in your pants?

32:03.589 --> 32:04.556
- It's okay, man.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.058
Those are scary motherfuckers.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.060
- No, man, it wasn't
the fucking raccoon.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.228
Something killed it.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.629
- Calm down, Irving.

32:10.629 --> 32:11.597
We're in the woods.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.365
It's normal.

32:13.365 --> 32:17.336
- I've never seen
anything like that before.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.238
- Anything like what?

32:19.238 --> 32:20.539
- It had a bite on its neck,

32:20.539 --> 32:23.609
and its guts were
spread everywhere.

32:27.813 --> 32:28.947
- Oh God, it's the ghost.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.881
It's the ghost.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.183
- Ghosts don't bite, Chrissy.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.086
- Okay, but, seriously,
first the howling,

32:34.086 --> 32:35.254
and now the raccoon.

32:42.028 --> 32:44.997
- I think it's best we
just get in the tents.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.365
I reckon it's gonna
be a long day tomorrow

32:46.365 --> 32:49.135
if we expect to
get to the grave.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.871
- I can't believe we're
looking for a grave

32:52.871 --> 32:53.905
to pass a class.

32:53.905 --> 32:55.941
- I'm supposed to sleep now?

32:55.941 --> 32:58.044
- Dude, just think
positive thoughts, man.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.011
Bubble gum--

32:59.011 --> 33:00.546
- Shut the hell up, Kenny.

33:00.546 --> 33:01.647
- I'm just
trying to help you

33:01.647 --> 33:03.649
enjoy the ride, Irving.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.652
- The fuck's
that even mean?

33:06.652 --> 33:07.586
- Isabella,

33:09.988 --> 33:10.822
you okay?

33:13.759 --> 33:14.826
- Yeah, yeah.

33:37.716 --> 33:38.550
- So, uh,

33:40.086 --> 33:41.753
wrapping up day one,

33:43.255 --> 33:45.857
some ups and some downs.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.027
As you can see, my
tent has been invaded

33:49.027 --> 33:52.631
by a fucking jerk
from Sixteen Candles,

33:52.631 --> 33:55.101
so yeah, that's awesome.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.206
- Why are you wearing that?

34:00.206 --> 34:03.375
We're not going to the mall
for a search.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.711
- Duh, but fashion doesn't die

34:05.711 --> 34:06.645
just 'cause we're in the sequel

34:06.645 --> 34:07.879
to Deliverance, Blair.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.581
- Am I supposed to
know what that means?

34:09.581 --> 34:12.751
- Look, we're only in
this God forsaken place

34:12.751 --> 34:14.853
because of your blind
obsession with a guy

34:14.853 --> 34:17.922
who wants nothing
to do with you.

34:17.922 --> 34:19.458
- I can't believe you're
talking to me like this.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.926
- Yeah, well, believe it,

34:20.926 --> 34:22.360
and I may be your pledge,

34:22.360 --> 34:23.895
but I think you could learn
a thing or two from me

34:23.895 --> 34:25.231
on how to dress.

34:27.266 --> 34:31.437
- On the upside, I could
probably bang Irving tonight.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.040
I guess my only hesitation is

34:36.242 --> 34:38.909
that he doesn't have a vagina.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.146
So, all in all,

34:41.813 --> 34:44.283
I'd say it's been
a pretty solid day.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.317
Kenny out.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.167
- Chrissy?

35:03.435 --> 35:04.270
Blair?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.609
- Okay, you only look semi-cute

35:10.609 --> 35:11.977
'cause you're hoping
that Irving notices

35:11.977 --> 35:14.613
you have a how to flirt
like a whore handbook.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.316
- At least I have
a plan to get laid.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.518
You don't even care
about this project,

35:19.518 --> 35:22.854
and you obviously are never
going to sleep with Blake.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.323
I mean, you're more than
a little delusional.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.524
- Delusional?

35:25.524 --> 35:26.792
He's my date to
the Debutante Ball.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.794
Do you have any idea
what that means?

35:28.794 --> 35:31.397
- Put it on your college
application, bitch.

35:31.397 --> 35:32.864
Knock yourself out.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.767
Look, you may think I'm dumb,

35:35.767 --> 35:36.768
but even I can tell,

35:36.768 --> 35:38.404
he is not into you.

35:38.404 --> 35:39.471
- Oh, yes he is.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.706
- Oh no, he's not.

35:40.706 --> 35:41.940
He likes Isabella.

35:41.940 --> 35:45.611
I mean, really, how
can you not see that?

35:45.611 --> 35:48.647
- Why are you trying to hurt me?

35:48.647 --> 35:50.816
I thought you were my friend.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.319
- And I thought you were mine.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.854
Look, look at me.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.593
I don't even know who
you are around this guy.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.562
Hey, the Blair I know and love

36:03.562 --> 36:06.998
is addicted to foot
massages and face masks.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.767
What happened to her?

36:10.001 --> 36:10.836
- Well,

36:13.004 --> 36:15.707
maybe you don't know me anymore.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.344
- I hope that's not true.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.111
I just wanna go home.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.023
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.661
Our Lord is with you.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.999
Yes,.

38:05.050 --> 38:05.851
- Chrissy?

38:11.056 --> 38:11.890
Chrissy?

38:11.890 --> 38:12.724
- What's wrong?

38:12.724 --> 38:14.159
- Chrissy's gone.

38:16.094 --> 38:17.195
- Gone where?

38:18.564 --> 38:19.831
- If I knew that,

38:19.831 --> 38:22.568
do you think I'd be
screaming her name?

38:22.568 --> 38:25.637
- Is her horse still there?

38:25.637 --> 38:27.138
- I'll go check.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.239
- I'm scared.

38:35.847 --> 38:39.851
- Uh, there's a huge
rip in your tent.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.319
- Don't touch anything.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.322
You gotta get this
all on camera.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.431
Oh, fuck, are you serious?

38:55.834 --> 38:58.303
That doesn't look
like a rip to me.

38:58.303 --> 39:00.005
That looks like it was slashed.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.573
- How would you know that?

39:01.573 --> 39:03.375
- Look how clean it is, man.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.943
- Her horse is gone.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.379
- An animal slashed my tent.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.847
I can't stay here.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.382
I have a Debutante
party on Saturday.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.850
You are my date,
for Christ's sakes.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.852
- Just try to relax.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.254
- Maybe she was
trying to go home.

39:16.254 --> 39:17.656
- She can't.

39:17.656 --> 39:18.890
I have the map.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.094
- Okay, everybody pack up.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.329
If she's not back by then,

39:24.329 --> 39:27.332
then we'll follow
her horse's tracks.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.220
- Nice bling, Mr. T.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.722
- Say what?

39:50.722 --> 39:52.624
- I pity the fool
who takes my gold chain.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.859
Let me hear you say it.

39:53.859 --> 39:57.095
Come on, you can do
it better than me.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.997
- I'm starting to
feel so much better.

39:58.997 --> 40:03.201
It's like you're my security
blanket or something.

40:03.201 --> 40:07.238
- Right, Irving, I'm the
racist one, of course.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.275
- Are we even sure these
are Chrissy's tracks?

40:10.275 --> 40:11.109
- It's like you don't even care

40:11.109 --> 40:12.377
about finding my friend.

40:12.377 --> 40:13.612
I mean, stop trying
to make me feel bad.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.846
- It's just an observation.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.848
Not everything's
about you, Blair.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.317
- What, do you see
something, man?

40:19.317 --> 40:21.052
- Kenny, we've been
walking for hours.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.888
Where are we?

40:22.888 --> 40:24.590
- I don't really know.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.092
All these trails look
the same on this map.

40:37.469 --> 40:38.303
- Chrissy.

40:42.674 --> 40:43.842
- Wait for me.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.445
- Blake.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.047
You can't just leave
me here, Blake.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.381
Blake.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.427
- Chrissy.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.995
- Irving.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.285
- Chrissy.

41:27.285 --> 41:28.119
Chrissy.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.356
Chrissy.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.047
- So, Blair, how you feeling?

42:01.452 --> 42:02.387
- Not safe.

42:03.555 --> 42:05.591
- I strike you as like
a dangerous kind of guy?

42:06.625 --> 42:08.393
- You watch too many movies.

42:08.393 --> 42:11.296
- See, I think you're
just a little camera shy.

42:11.296 --> 42:12.363
- Oh, really?

42:13.264 --> 42:14.399
How's this?

42:14.399 --> 42:16.101
This better?

42:16.101 --> 42:17.836
How about this?

42:17.836 --> 42:18.937
Is that good?

42:20.105 --> 42:22.507
- Hey, not the
fucking drugs, girl.

42:22.507 --> 42:25.577
You're not that cute, Jesus.

42:25.577 --> 42:26.411
Fuck.

43:34.179 --> 43:35.647
- Jesus Christ.

43:35.647 --> 43:37.515
Isabella, where'd you come from?

43:37.515 --> 43:38.349
- I'm so turned around.

43:38.349 --> 43:39.851
I don't even know.

43:42.821 --> 43:46.257
- You ever see anything
like this before?

43:47.092 --> 43:49.094
- In a nightmare, maybe.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.438
Let's get out of here.

44:02.540 --> 44:05.143
- Alright, go get the others.

44:05.143 --> 44:06.077
I'm gonna go in.

44:06.077 --> 44:06.912
- I'm not leaving you alone.

44:06.912 --> 44:08.079
Are you crazy?

44:36.808 --> 44:39.310
- What the fuck would do this?

44:42.680 --> 44:43.915
- I don't know.

44:53.491 --> 44:56.294
I don't think you
should touch anything.

45:05.203 --> 45:06.938
- Fuck, oh fuck.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.115
- What the fuck was that?

45:17.115 --> 45:18.950
- I am not staying
here with you.

45:18.950 --> 45:20.651
- Where are you going?

45:20.651 --> 45:21.753
Blair.

45:21.753 --> 45:22.788
Where are you going?

45:22.788 --> 45:24.555
- Blake, help.

45:24.555 --> 45:25.390
- Blair.

45:25.390 --> 45:29.127
- Blake,.

45:41.339 --> 45:42.407
- Hey, Blair?

45:44.342 --> 45:45.176
Blair.

45:46.611 --> 45:47.712
Hey, hold up.

45:55.053 --> 45:56.955
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

46:00.025 --> 46:01.326
- Are you okay?

46:02.427 --> 46:04.295
Oh my God.

46:07.365 --> 46:08.934
- Holy shit.

46:08.934 --> 46:10.468
Whose blood is that?

46:10.468 --> 46:13.972
- We need to call the
cops right now, man.

46:16.207 --> 46:17.542
We're being watched, alright?

46:17.542 --> 46:18.676
We're being watched,

46:18.676 --> 46:20.178
and I can feel it.

46:38.496 --> 46:39.697
- They were right here.

46:39.697 --> 46:43.168
I just left them
right fucking here.

46:43.168 --> 46:44.135
- We're being
watched, alright.

46:44.135 --> 46:45.770
- Nothing is out there.

46:45.770 --> 46:47.072
- It took Chrissy too.

46:47.072 --> 46:48.006
- You don't know that.

46:48.006 --> 46:49.007
- I saw it riding her horse.

46:49.007 --> 46:50.942
- I wanna go home.

46:50.942 --> 46:51.776
- Me too.

46:51.776 --> 46:52.978
- Right now.

46:52.978 --> 46:54.312
- Man, you're
covered in blood.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.614
What was in that shed?

46:56.614 --> 46:58.683
- Chrissy was in that
shed, wasn't she?

46:58.683 --> 47:00.318
- Can you get us back?

47:00.318 --> 47:01.586
- The map was with
my horse, man.

47:01.586 --> 47:02.520
We're fucked.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.689
- Kenny, this is all your fault.

47:04.689 --> 47:06.324
This is why you
will never get laid.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.558
You are such a little bitch.

47:07.558 --> 47:09.494
- How is this my
fault in any way?

47:09.494 --> 47:11.029
What part of this
is my fucking fault?

47:11.029 --> 47:11.863
- Guys, calm down.

47:11.863 --> 47:12.998
Calm down.

47:12.998 --> 47:15.100
- I can get us back.

47:15.100 --> 47:16.601
- Without the map?

47:19.437 --> 47:20.638
- We just have to
follow our tracks

47:20.638 --> 47:21.672
like.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.308
- Oh, following tracks,

47:23.308 --> 47:24.943
that is how we got into this.

47:24.943 --> 47:27.045
- You have a better idea?

47:39.057 --> 47:41.859
- We got the gun, five bullets,

47:41.859 --> 47:43.028
and a lighter.

47:46.297 --> 47:49.034
- I got a flashlight and a pen.

47:49.034 --> 47:50.601
- Oh, dude, nice.

47:50.601 --> 47:51.669
We're definitely
gonna need that pen.

47:51.669 --> 47:53.238
Am I right, guys?

47:53.238 --> 47:55.073
- Fuck you, Kenny.

47:55.073 --> 47:56.674
What do you have?

47:56.674 --> 47:58.977
- I got some chocolate bars

47:58.977 --> 48:00.211
and some drugs.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.115
- And that's it?

48:05.283 --> 48:06.851
- Oh, and a condom.

48:08.453 --> 48:09.687
- A condom?

48:09.687 --> 48:10.956
Seriously, man.

48:12.123 --> 48:13.291
- Man, I'd rather
go bareback too.

48:13.291 --> 48:15.460
It's not the '60s anymore.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.563
- What about you, Blair?

48:18.563 --> 48:19.830
- Maxi pads, okay?

48:19.830 --> 48:21.266
I have Maxi pads.

48:22.267 --> 48:23.201
What?

48:23.201 --> 48:24.435
It's my time of the month.

48:24.435 --> 48:26.271
- That explains a lot.

48:27.672 --> 48:28.506
Don't look at me.

48:28.506 --> 48:30.075
I don't have anything.

48:30.075 --> 48:31.009
- How about your purse?

48:31.009 --> 48:32.843
There's nothing in your purse?

48:32.843 --> 48:35.346
- Socks and underwear,

48:35.346 --> 48:36.914
nothing we can use.

48:38.183 --> 48:39.284
- Perfect.

48:39.284 --> 48:41.619
- Guys, let's not fight.

48:41.619 --> 48:42.853
I mean, we'd be totally fucked

48:42.853 --> 48:45.256
without those Maxi
pads.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.658
- Oh, fuck you, virgin.

48:47.658 --> 48:50.661
- Does anyone have
water or a flask?

48:52.930 --> 48:54.332
- There's a creek close by.

48:54.332 --> 48:57.368
Maybe we can fill up
that condom with water.

48:57.368 --> 48:59.470
- Is that even possible?

48:59.470 --> 49:02.040
- I bet it's way
too small for that.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.308
- Okay, so first of all,

49:03.308 --> 49:05.710
literally every condom
is too small for that.

49:05.710 --> 49:09.580
Secondly, it's gonna be
nasty and lubey and gross,

49:09.580 --> 49:11.182
and I don't even think
we should be drinking

49:11.182 --> 49:12.583
river water, you guys.

49:12.583 --> 49:13.985
- Shut up, Kenny.

49:13.985 --> 49:15.586
- Yeah, alright.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.818
- You sure we
made a right back there?

49:47.818 --> 49:48.853
I can hardly make out the tracks

49:48.853 --> 49:50.388
with all this rain.

49:50.388 --> 49:53.358
- Don't forget, we're coming
from the opposite direction.

49:53.358 --> 49:55.693
- Guys, I'm literally 100% sure

49:55.693 --> 49:57.562
these are Buttercup's tracks.

49:57.562 --> 50:00.298
Remember, she has
that birthmark.

50:02.133 --> 50:03.334
- I mean, Professor
Anderson can't give us

50:03.334 --> 50:04.935
an incomplete for this, right?

50:04.935 --> 50:06.704
I mean, she can't fail us.

50:06.704 --> 50:07.872
- I haven't thought about that.

50:07.872 --> 50:08.806
- Well, I have,

50:08.806 --> 50:09.707
and my daddy's gonna kill me

50:09.707 --> 50:11.409
if I don't get all A's,

50:11.409 --> 50:12.910
and thank God, why
do I even care?

50:12.910 --> 50:14.112
I mean, we're totally fucked.

50:14.112 --> 50:15.646
We're all gonna end
up like Chrissy.

50:15.646 --> 50:16.881
- You're right.

50:17.815 --> 50:20.451
What are we even doing this for?

50:20.451 --> 50:21.352
Whatever's out
there is gonna come

50:21.352 --> 50:22.620
and get us all.

50:24.189 --> 50:27.492
Come and get us, mother fucker.

50:27.492 --> 50:30.428
We're right here,
you little bitch.

50:32.197 --> 50:33.198
I gotta pee.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.368
- I'll make sure she's okay.

50:38.269 --> 50:40.171
- Blake, wait.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.691
- What are you doing?

51:00.691 --> 51:02.593
- I thought I lost you.

51:02.593 --> 51:04.762
- I said I was going
to the bathroom.

51:04.762 --> 51:06.731
That's creepy, Blake.

51:06.731 --> 51:10.868
- Sorry, I just didn't
want you to be alone.

51:10.868 --> 51:12.870
- You wanna watch?

51:24.315 --> 51:25.616
I see you looking at me.

51:25.616 --> 51:26.717
- I'm not.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.319
- You better not be.

51:28.319 --> 51:30.054
- Don't flatter yourself.

51:30.054 --> 51:31.689
- I'm not.

51:35.160 --> 51:38.129
- Mind if I ask a
personal question?

51:38.129 --> 51:40.965
- Like this isn't
personal enough?

51:42.233 --> 51:44.969
- Why don't you
have a boyfriend?

51:46.771 --> 51:48.273
- How do you know I don't?

51:48.273 --> 51:49.274
- You don't.

51:50.808 --> 51:53.344
- What, are you stalking
me or something?

51:53.344 --> 51:56.614
- Not exactly
the word I'd use.

51:57.715 --> 51:58.549
- No?

52:07.492 --> 52:09.827
What would you call it then?

52:10.895 --> 52:11.962
- Interested.

52:14.064 --> 52:15.633
- You shouldn't be.

52:27.445 --> 52:28.946
- How do you know we're
going the right way?

52:28.946 --> 52:30.281
- I know we are.

52:31.849 --> 52:32.683
- I remember that.

52:32.683 --> 52:33.518
She's right.

52:33.518 --> 52:34.519
- I don't.

52:34.519 --> 52:35.520
- Me neither, but we can use it

52:35.520 --> 52:37.054
to make a roof for our camp.

52:37.054 --> 52:39.790
- No, no, no, I'm not
stopping for anything.

52:39.790 --> 52:40.625
- What do you mean?

52:40.625 --> 52:41.559
It's almost dark out.

52:41.559 --> 52:43.027
- You guys can do what you want,

52:43.027 --> 52:44.895
but I'm not staying in
these woods another night.

52:44.895 --> 52:46.130
- I'm with Irving.

52:46.130 --> 52:47.398
Someone's missing right now.

52:47.398 --> 52:49.334
- We can make this a
real shelter, guys.

52:49.334 --> 52:50.535
- I vote we stay.

52:50.535 --> 52:51.802
We need to stick together.

52:51.802 --> 52:53.103
Besides, Blake's
got the only gun.

52:53.103 --> 52:53.938
- Keep it.

52:53.938 --> 52:54.772
I'm out.

52:54.772 --> 52:56.207
- Don't leave.

52:56.207 --> 52:57.742
- Listen, there is
something in these woods,

52:57.742 --> 53:00.445
and it's not
getting me, alright?

53:01.546 --> 53:03.381
- Stay with us, Kenny.

53:04.515 --> 53:05.350
- No, I'm sorry.

53:05.350 --> 53:06.183
I'm with Irving.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.017
This place is fucked.

53:15.460 --> 53:18.296
- We gotta find some
dry wood and leaves.

53:18.296 --> 53:22.367
- It's gonna be hard
to find anything dry.

53:22.367 --> 53:23.200
- Yeah.

53:46.056 --> 53:48.092
- This doesn't
look right, man.

53:48.092 --> 53:49.927
- Looks familiar to me, man.

53:53.264 --> 53:57.067
- Okay, so this is
clearly not the way.

53:57.067 --> 53:59.470
- I didn't account for six
inches of rain, alright?

53:59.470 --> 54:00.638
- Man, six inches of rain?

54:00.638 --> 54:02.006
This is a fucking cliff.

54:02.006 --> 54:02.907
We didn't go this way.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.141
- We did, Kenny.

54:04.141 --> 54:05.376
It just didn't look
like this before, man.

54:05.376 --> 54:07.545
- Okay, maybe it didn't
look like this before

54:07.545 --> 54:09.280
because we haven't
fucking been here before.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.016
- We just need to find
a way across, alright?

54:12.016 --> 54:13.484
- No man, I say we go
back to that last turn--

54:13.484 --> 54:16.854
- No, no, no, we're
not going back, Kenny.

54:16.854 --> 54:20.224
Just see if that trail
leads to the creek,

54:20.224 --> 54:21.659
and I'll go look for
a downed tree brach

54:21.659 --> 54:22.593
or something, alright?

54:22.593 --> 54:23.528
- Man, this idea is bullshit.

54:23.528 --> 54:24.529
Let's go back to that last turn.

54:24.529 --> 54:25.663
We'll find a bridge.

54:25.663 --> 54:26.997
- You're not
fucking safe, Kenny.

54:26.997 --> 54:29.734
Leave whenever you want, man.

54:29.734 --> 54:30.968
- Fuck, are you kidding me?

54:30.968 --> 54:32.236
This sucks.

54:32.236 --> 54:33.304
You suck.

54:33.304 --> 54:34.705
This whole fucking thing sucks.

54:34.705 --> 54:36.707
I'm so fucking done
with this shit.

54:39.977 --> 54:42.313
Fucking piece of shit.

54:45.215 --> 54:46.050
- Kenny.

54:46.050 --> 54:46.884
- Fuck.

54:46.884 --> 54:47.718
- Kenny.

54:47.718 --> 54:49.219
- Irving, help me.

54:50.321 --> 54:51.489
- Fuck, man, fuck--

54:51.489 --> 54:52.690
- It's on my leg, man.

54:52.690 --> 54:55.292
I don't know what the
fuck this is, man.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.794
- Okay, alright, alright,
alright, stop moving.

54:56.794 --> 54:57.762
Stop moving, man.

54:59.930 --> 55:01.966
- Oh my fucking God, get
this fucking thing off me.

55:01.966 --> 55:03.233
- Keep still.

55:03.233 --> 55:04.502
Don't move, don't move,
don't move, don't move.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.837
- Get this fucking
thing off me, man.

55:06.837 --> 55:07.672
- Keep still.

55:07.672 --> 55:08.506
Keep still.

55:08.506 --> 55:09.340
Don't move.

55:09.340 --> 55:10.174
- Man--

55:10.174 --> 55:11.008
- Don't move.

55:11.008 --> 55:11.842
Just keep still, man.

55:11.842 --> 55:12.677
Alright.

55:13.678 --> 55:14.945
What the hell is
this thing, man?

55:14.945 --> 55:16.414
- I can't feel
my fucking foot, man.

55:16.414 --> 55:17.247
- Kenny, stop.

55:17.247 --> 55:18.182
Stop, Kenny.

55:18.182 --> 55:19.116
- Fucking thing--

55:19.116 --> 55:19.784
- Alright, Kenny, look at me.

55:19.784 --> 55:20.718
Look at me.

55:20.718 --> 55:21.419
I'm gonna get you help, alright?

55:21.419 --> 55:22.653
- No, no--

55:22.653 --> 55:23.454
- Kenny, I'm gonna
come right back.

55:23.454 --> 55:24.389
I promise, Kenny.

55:24.389 --> 55:25.623
- Don't you fucking leave me.

55:25.623 --> 55:26.290
- Kenny, I'm gonna
come right back.

55:26.290 --> 55:27.091
I promise, man.

55:27.091 --> 55:28.393
- Please don't leave me.

55:28.393 --> 55:29.193
Irving.

55:30.060 --> 55:32.397
I'm gonna fucking, Irving.

55:32.397 --> 55:33.664
Irving, Irving.

55:38.903 --> 55:40.037
Fuck.

56:04.495 --> 56:08.232
- And Kenny said these
were good for nothing.

56:11.135 --> 56:14.972
- The stars are really
beautiful tonight, huh?

56:16.907 --> 56:17.975
- Mmhm, yeah.

56:24.381 --> 56:28.385
- So this is what it's
like to be a third wheel.

56:30.588 --> 56:33.891
I always wondered
what that felt like.

56:37.528 --> 56:38.362
- Blair, wait.

56:38.362 --> 56:39.196
- Let her go.

56:39.196 --> 56:40.130
Let her go.

56:43.668 --> 56:45.703
- It isn't right.

56:45.703 --> 56:47.705
All five of us should really
be together right now.

56:47.705 --> 56:49.273
- Stop.

56:49.273 --> 56:50.608
I need to talk to you.

56:50.608 --> 56:51.609
- Now?

56:51.609 --> 56:54.044
- Is there ever a right time?

56:55.279 --> 56:56.213
Let her go.

57:08.826 --> 57:10.461
Why do you take them?

57:10.461 --> 57:11.962
- Why do you care?

57:13.831 --> 57:15.966
What are you trying to
prove right now, Blake?

57:15.966 --> 57:18.368
- I just wanna talk
alone for once.

57:18.368 --> 57:21.706
- Alone is exactly
what we shouldn't be.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.842
You think you know me, Blake?

57:24.842 --> 57:26.176
- I'm trying to.

57:28.145 --> 57:29.980
- You have everything.

57:31.516 --> 57:33.784
What are you doing with me?

57:34.919 --> 57:36.821
- Look, I know
you don't remember

57:36.821 --> 57:38.656
the first time we met,

57:39.790 --> 57:40.625
but I do,

57:42.392 --> 57:43.427
and ever since then,

57:43.427 --> 57:45.329
I wake up every Sunday morning

57:45.329 --> 57:48.298
and watch you ride
your bike to church,

57:48.298 --> 57:49.534
and I know that when
you move your hair

57:49.534 --> 57:50.901
from left to right,

57:50.901 --> 57:53.504
it means you're nervous.

57:53.504 --> 57:54.338
- What?

57:55.873 --> 57:58.776
- I compare every girl to you.

57:58.776 --> 58:00.811
They don't even hold a candle.

58:10.287 --> 58:12.823
- That story I told you,

58:12.823 --> 58:14.258
that little girl,

58:16.493 --> 58:18.495
that little girl was me.

58:22.232 --> 58:25.469
I should have never
come with you guys.

58:26.403 --> 58:28.138
Everyone's in danger.

58:45.556 --> 58:46.557
- It's okay.

58:49.259 --> 58:50.661
Where's Isabella?

58:51.962 --> 58:53.130
- Who?

59:14.885 --> 59:16.687
- Holy shit.

59:31.669 --> 59:32.502
Who's there?

59:32.502 --> 59:33.337
Can you help me please?

59:33.337 --> 59:34.271
Who's there?

59:34.271 --> 59:35.472
Who's there?

59:35.472 --> 59:37.107
Please fucking help me.

59:37.107 --> 59:38.909
Please fucking help me.

59:38.909 --> 59:40.277
I don't wanna die.

59:40.277 --> 59:41.746
I don't wanna die.

59:41.746 --> 59:42.579
Oh, fuck.

59:44.514 --> 59:45.783
Who's there?

59:45.783 --> 59:46.951
Please help me.

59:46.951 --> 59:49.586
I don't wanna
fucking die, please.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.420
Hey.

01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:17.481
I know you're out there.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.686
Come out, you mother fucker.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.468
- Irving, please don't leave me.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:15.940
So, um,

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:22.612
my foot's fucked,

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:24.114
and I'm all alone,

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.056
so that sucks fucking balls.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:49.940
Oh my God.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:51.842
Thank God.

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:55.279
Is help coming?

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:59.049
- There's no help on the way.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.658
- Fucking thing is locked.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:10.727
- It's okay.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:13.497
It's okay.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:14.932
- No, my leg is fucked.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:17.734
This thing's fucking locked,

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.303
fucking miles from okay.

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:21.638
- Sh, they have locks, sure,

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:31.782
but everything is possible

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:36.020
if you have one of these.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:40.791
- We gotta find Isabella.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:46.396
- I
feel really dizzy.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:57.041
- You're gonna be okay.

01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:00.878
What the fuck?

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.648
- You're bleeding.

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:06.817
- It's not mine.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.792
- Why do you have a key?

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:22.332
- It is not the question
you should be asking.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.234
No.

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:28.205
Question you should be asking is

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:37.948
how am I gonna get an A

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:42.119
on this class project,
huh?

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:47.224
Emily Burt wants you.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:55.665
I want you to have a perfect
finale for your movie.

01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:02.472
Don't you still
want that, Kenny?

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:04.541
- I definitely want that.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:09.446
Get this off of me, please.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:14.684
- In a minute.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:20.490
First, we should examine
how we got here, right?

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:24.494
'Cause, I mean,

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:32.402
I know how we got here, but,

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:42.212
we should not have gotten
here this way, right?

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:43.447
Should we?

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:44.348
- No, but--

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:45.182
- No.

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:47.617
- I know.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:56.293
- Fuck.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.364
- Blake.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:01.131
Blake.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.371
- Oh my fucking God.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.715
- Where's your camera?

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.286
- I lost it.

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:26.023
- Goddammit.

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:32.429
I wanted to see.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:33.730
- You could go find it.

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:35.099
It's probably close.

01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:36.100
Just if you unlock me,

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.268
we could probably find it.

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:42.772
- So good.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.041
You're so good.

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:48.012
You're so good.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:53.517
I was so impressed with you.

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:57.187
I didn't wanna tell you.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:05:59.556
I didn't wanna tell you about it

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:00.624
in front of all the others,

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:03.027
how impressed I was with you.

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:15.039
You should be real proud
of yourself, Kenny.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:23.113
You know what lycanthropy is?

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:25.615
- No.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:29.753
- I do.

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:32.956
Emily Burt did too.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.560
Those newspaper articles,

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.263
they fucking lie.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:41.931
They lie.

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:44.401
The truth, Kenny,

01:06:46.536 --> 01:06:49.373
the truth is an
ugly thing, Kenny.

01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:01.185
- Please don't kill me.

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.452
Please don't kill me.

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:04.221
Please don't kill me.

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:07.591
Please.

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:10.394
- Beg me.

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:12.262
- Please.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:18.868
- Beg me please.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:19.703
- Please.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.672
Please, this is fine.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:23.940
You don't need to kill me.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:30.280
- I know.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:35.619
I wish I could stop.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:41.991
- No, please don't kill me.

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.059
Please don't kill.

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:50.894
* Trying to be what
you want me to be

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:54.564
* I'm trying to be your man

01:08:55.765 --> 01:09:00.270
* I only see what
you want me to see

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:04.308
* They see the gun in your hands

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:09.879
* You had me fooled
at all the right times

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:13.716
* You always knew what to say

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:19.423
* Swimming through
the fire in my mind

01:09:19.423 --> 01:09:23.593
* It's time to
put out the flames

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:28.232
* Mamma said I don't know you

01:09:28.232 --> 01:09:30.533
* But I know that I do

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:34.203
* But I know that I do, yeah

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:37.774
* Mamma said I don't love you

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:40.109
* But I know that I do

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:43.947
* But I know that
I do, yeah, yeah

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:46.182
* Pull the trigger now

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:48.417
* Pull the trigger now

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.819
* Pull the trigger now

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:53.189
* Pull the trigger now

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.659
* Pull the trigger now

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:57.994
* Pull the trigger now

01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.464
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:00.464 --> 01:10:02.866
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:05.201
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.604
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:10.039
* And pull the trigger now

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.409
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:14.944
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:17.180
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.050
* Pull the trigger now

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.118
* Yeah

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:25.889
* Mamma said I don't know you

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:28.191
* But I know that I do

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:33.062
* But I know that
I do, yeah, yeah

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.465
- Blake.

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:37.701
- Give me your hand, Blair.

01:10:40.504 --> 01:10:42.038
Give me your hand.

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:43.540
Give me your hand.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:48.678
- I can't hold on.

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.614
Oh my God, Chrissy, no.

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:51.615
Oh my God, is it Chrissy?

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:52.449
- I don't know.

01:10:52.449 --> 01:10:53.283
I don't know.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.117
- We're gonna die.

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:54.951
We're gonna die.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:55.785
We're gonna die.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.054
- It's okay.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.863
- Blake, is that you?

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:07.731
- We're down here.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:08.832
Help, please.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.602
- Thank God it didn't get you.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.339
- Please
help us, please.

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:19.275
- It's watching us.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:23.780
There's
a house nearby.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.181
Here, here, here.

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:29.319
Pull yourself up.

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:30.186
I tied it to a tree.

01:11:30.186 --> 01:11:32.021
Just pull yourself up.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.191
Come on.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:38.862
Come on, Blair.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:40.764
- Blair, come on.

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:48.838
- Come on.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:53.577
- Come on,
come on, come on.

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:56.673
- Wait.

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:09.953
Good boy.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.324
Come on.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:17.326
- Are you joking?

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:19.062
We can't go in there.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:22.799
- Leave her.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.001
- I can't.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.071
Do you wanna go home?

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.272
- Duh.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:31.340
- Well, then you
don't have a choice.

01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:07.477
- It's okay.

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:08.912
- The fuck it is.

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:12.916
- Let's all just
calm down, okay?

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.285
If it wanted us dead,

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.387
they would have
killed us already.

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:22.191
- Blair, don't.

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:23.426
Blair, don't move.

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:24.460
- No, I have to
get to that phone.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.394
I just know that there's help

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.596
on the other end of that line.

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:27.764
I just know it.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.201
- They're just scared.

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:35.438
They don't mean any harm.

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:36.873
I promise.

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:37.707
- Why are you talking to them

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:38.542
like they understand?

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:39.909
They're fucking wolves.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:41.410
- Because they do.

01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:45.782
- Hello?

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.820
Please help me.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.055
- Oh my
goodness, what's wrong?

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:53.089
- Come with me.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:54.991
- No, where are you taking me?

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.993
Where are you taking me?

01:14:58.528 --> 01:14:59.796
- Please help me.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.264
There are coyotes
trying to eat me,

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:03.099
and all of my friends are dead.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.101
- Those aren't
coyotes, darling.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:06.435
Those are wolves.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.874
- Wolves?

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:13.242
- There's a
button on the piano.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.410
Do you see it?

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:19.415
- Yes, yes, I see it.

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:22.719
- Good,
good, now press it.

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:24.621
Help is coming, dear.

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:01.190
- What is all this?

01:16:02.826 --> 01:16:04.828
- My childhood memories.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.332
- I don't understand.

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:14.503
Please tell me you
didn't do all this.

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:15.371
- I tried to warn you,

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:17.373
but you wouldn't listen.

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:20.276
This is me.

01:16:21.645 --> 01:16:25.481
Now you kn
