01:43.895 --> 01:45.897
...in that special fraternity

01:46.064 --> 01:51.110
of courageous men who risk life
and limb to explore the stars,

01:51.277 --> 01:55.114
and secure peace
and freedom the world over.

01:55.824 --> 01:59.202
We are a nation
with a tradition of heroism.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.080
Hey, does anybody know
where the head is around here?

02:02.247 --> 02:04.666
...who are with us here tonight...

02:04.833 --> 02:06.334
fill that need.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.755
Through their strength of character,
their fortitude,

02:10.922 --> 02:16.511
They have proven themselves
to be worthy of the appellation...

02:16.678 --> 02:17.929
hero.

02:18.096 --> 02:22.934
Tonight we are paying tribute
to a breed of men...

02:27.522 --> 02:29.899
Where is a guy supposed to
take a leak around here?

02:37.991 --> 02:41.119
Well, damn if we're not
balls to the wall

02:41.286 --> 02:44.122
of all-American hero types here tonight.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.835
I see space walkers and moon walkers

02:49.002 --> 02:51.421
and earth orbiters galore.

02:52.463 --> 02:56.467
And over here we have
the current cream of the crop.

02:56.634 --> 03:00.138
America's best and brightest.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.141
That's a good one, eh, boys?

03:03.308 --> 03:07.896
The most excitement I ever had,
was the time I landed a crippled F-14

03:08.062 --> 03:12.442
with a stubborn nose gear on the deck
of a rolling flattop in zero visibility.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.113
But you boys...

03:17.280 --> 03:21.326
you get to test out these babies.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.829
I envy you.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.335
Gentlemen... I salute you.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.087
Shit, I spilled my drink.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.802
Hey, hey, hey, easy fellows.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.765
Battle conditions, boys?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.728
Why don't you get yourself a new
act, Pendleton, you're a disgrace.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.940
Give that cripple tomcat story a rest
because we've all heard it.

03:52.106 --> 03:55.944
Gosh, I'm sorry, Rusty.
Really, you're right.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.946
But at least
when my moment of truth came

03:58.112 --> 04:00.990
I didn't take a dump down the leg
of my flight suit.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.992
You, son of a...

04:07.455 --> 04:08.832
Well, come on, boys!

04:08.998 --> 04:11.751
Isn't this what you always wanted?
A piece of Tuck Pendleton?

04:14.712 --> 04:16.130
Shouldn't the, um...

04:16.297 --> 04:18.423
Shouldn't the project be de-classified?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.218
You know I can't tell you that.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.265
Could you just excuse me? I'm sorry.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.017
All right, that's enough! That's enough!

04:32.897 --> 04:37.235
Hello, Pete. Where's your uniform?
Where's your uniform?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.737
Where yours should've been
a long time ago.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.406
Hanging in the closet.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.492
Don't worry, Pete.
The wait is almost over.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.294
Take him home with you.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.395
I'm going to try and hit the couch...
okay?

05:12.562 --> 05:13.730
No wait, wait.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.402
All you had to do was ask, honey.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.789
Charming. You want a drink?

05:37.670 --> 05:41.341
- What is all this?
- Something new I'm involved in.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.469
- Rabbits?
- Yeah, wabbits.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.971
You resigned your commission
to study rabbits?

05:47.138 --> 05:49.411
Shit.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.981
- Now take it easy.
- That's good advice.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.820
You better get some ice on that.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.239
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.282
You're in no shape to drive, Lydia.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.452
Oh, I am in no shape to drive?
That's really good, Tuck.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.995
You leave me no choice.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.004
- Not fair.
- What is?

06:21.673 --> 06:24.676
- ♪ Straight to your lover's heart ♪
- Don't.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.052
♪ For me ♪

06:26.219 --> 06:27.679
Oh, come on.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.119
Hey, I said to the man on the phone,
"Don't honk."

06:51.286 --> 06:54.122
Lady, all I got was an address,
not a book of instructions.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.498
Lydia!

06:55.665 --> 06:58.710
- What is going on here?
- You got any bags?

06:58.877 --> 07:01.254
No. You know what's going on here.
You read the note.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.965
- Yeah, I read the note.
- Good, nice clean break.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.216
Leave everything behind.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.427
- I don't live here.
- One-nighter?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.054
- Shut up, get back in your cab!
- Shut up, just shut up!

07:10.221 --> 07:11.598
Yeah, I read the note.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.517
Just standard farewell address.
I know it by heart.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.438
- Excuse me.
- Lydia.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.941
Look, don't leave. You know you love me.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.113
Look, I know you're crazy about me.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.365
I mean... in a week or two,

07:29.532 --> 07:31.659
I'm gonna call you
or you're gonna call me,

07:31.826 --> 07:34.996
- we're gonna be back together again
- No, we won't!

07:36.039 --> 07:39.250
I don't get it. I get a little drunk...

07:40.585 --> 07:42.337
I make an ass out of myself.

07:43.963 --> 07:47.217
- What's the big deal?
- Things are different now, Tuck.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.677
It just hurts me too much
to be with you.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.888
Lydia!

07:53.389 --> 07:58.436
Lydia, I stubbed my toe
on the cab when I kicked door.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.772
I think it's broken.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.857
Well, better your toe than your heart.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.735
- Can we go now, please?
- Lydia!

08:05.902 --> 08:07.946
Lydia!

08:08.112 --> 08:10.990
Lydia!

08:18.289 --> 08:20.124
I sure hope you didn't leave
your purse back there.

08:35.181 --> 08:39.352
Okay, Jack. Let's review.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.272
We've got nausea,
we've got shortness of breath,

08:42.438 --> 08:44.941
we've got dizziness we've got headaches.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.277
Big, pounding headaches.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.529
Big... poun...

08:49.696 --> 08:51.489
Huh. What's going on up here?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.449
Where did you get that rash?

08:53.616 --> 08:55.076
- Hairspray.
- Hairspray?

08:55.243 --> 08:58.288
It also makes me sneeze like crazy.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.747
So, what do you think?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.958
I think you're allergic to hairspray.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.460
Isn't this great, Jack?

09:04.627 --> 09:07.046
I think we're making
real progress today.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.341
Okay... Uh-huh.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.553
The nightmares still keeping you
awake at night?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.513
Mm-hm. And now I have a new one.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.141
Put your head back. Tell me about it.

09:18.308 --> 09:22.145
Well, I'm at the market,
working one of the registers.

09:22.312 --> 09:26.733
And I suddenly notice
the next customer is this horrible,

09:26.900 --> 09:29.569
obnoxious woman with bright orange hair.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.154
Anyway...

09:32.405 --> 09:36.284
I'm passing her stuff over
the bar code scanner

09:36.451 --> 09:38.369
and I don't notice it, but the computer

09:38.536 --> 09:40.997
starts to ring up all the wrong prices.

09:41.164 --> 09:46.815
So when I'm all done I look at
the total and it's way up over...

09:46.982 --> 09:51.591
and it's way up over...
and it's way up over $100,000.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.967
- That much?
- Yes.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.055
So the woman with the orange hair
says to me, real calm...

09:57.222 --> 09:59.182
she says to me:

09:59.349 --> 10:02.185
"I don't carry that kind of cash
around on me, sweetie."

10:02.352 --> 10:03.895
- Want to open wide, there?
- Yeah.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.026
And I say, "Oh, is that right?"
And she says,

10:10.193 --> 10:12.862
"Will you take this instead?"

10:13.029 --> 10:14.906
And she reaches into her purse,

10:15.073 --> 10:18.576
and she pulls out this little
pearl-handled pistol.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.119
And she pulls back on the trigger,

10:20.286 --> 10:23.832
and it's at that moment
that I wake up screaming.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.712
Take it easy, Jack. It's all right.
The nurse will get it.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.590
Just sit down. Sit down.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.634
I'm sorry, Jack.
I didn't mean to push you.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.765
Jack, please, sit down and relax.
Catch your breath.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.976
Come on.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.936
Jack...

10:45.103 --> 10:48.231
you know that I'm more
than your doctor. I'm your friend.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.525
You're one of my favorite patients.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.694
Let's face it,
your regular office visits

10:52.861 --> 10:55.822
are the cornerstone of my
entire medical practice.

10:58.116 --> 11:01.161
But the problem is,
medicine is not what you need, Jack.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.788
What you need is rest and relaxation.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.666
I think you need a total
change of scene.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.460
May be a nice vacation.
How does that sound?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.754
It sounds good.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.506
Well then, take one.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.093
And find a place
that's peaceful and quiet.

11:17.260 --> 11:22.265
Because the most important thing
for you right now is no excitement.

11:22.891 --> 11:23.808
Got it?

11:25.101 --> 11:28.354
- I know it's hard to believe...
- Hard? Try impossible.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.690
That's why I want you there
to see for yourself.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.651
Then, if you're interested,
the project's yours.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.196
Look, first amaze me,
then we'll talk funding.

11:37.509 --> 11:40.325
Damn this traffic.
We're gonna be late.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.536
Just out of curiosity,
who's your guy? Your pilot?

11:43.703 --> 11:46.748
You might know him.
Pendleton. Tuck Pendleton.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.210
Why did you choose Pendleton?

11:50.376 --> 11:53.651
- He had the right qualifications.
- Such as?

11:53.817 --> 11:56.591
He's the only one we could find
who was crazy enough to do it.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.136
Let me tell you something
about Tuck Pendleton.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.973
He could have been one of the best.
But he hates authority,

12:04.140 --> 12:06.851
he can't take orders and
he likes to make up his own rules.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.980
Ah, don't look so depressed.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.066
The experiment is bound
to fail long before

12:13.233 --> 12:15.276
Pendleton has a chance to screw it up.

12:16.319 --> 12:20.990
How does that feel? It feels good.
Then do it again.

12:23.493 --> 12:27.539
The Tuck Pendleton machine,
zero defects.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.685
You're not getting nervous, are you?

12:30.894 --> 12:32.585
Not yet.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.338
Look, Lieutenant,
let's review this neuromuscular

12:35.505 --> 12:37.173
facial response experiment
one more time.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.676
Let's not, huh? All right?

12:40.552 --> 12:43.513
- What do you mean, let's not...?
- Ozzie, who's nervous now?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.683
I know what our objectives are.
I've done my homework.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.185
I can do this little job
blindfolded and backwards,

12:49.352 --> 12:50.687
so everybody just calm down.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.545
Initiate hydroponics check.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.673
Initiating.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.222
- Good luck, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.351
Zero-nine-five.
All personnel to the station, please.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.903
Just one more thing, Lieutenant.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.113
I just want to make sure
we've got everything down.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.617
It's not gonna be simple but there
shouldn't be any surprises or...

13:46.743 --> 13:48.328
Good luck, Lieutenant.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.604
Be careful of this 3808 unit.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.650
I spilled coffee on it last week.
It's not quite as reliable as it was.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.110
Um... still rolling? Great!

14:21.820 --> 14:24.155
Uh... we are using an experimental

14:24.322 --> 14:28.451
submersible pod,
modified with a performance enhanced

14:28.618 --> 14:31.496
helium neon laser scalpel
of our own proprietary design.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.957
This was a 50 milliwatt unit originally,

14:34.123 --> 14:35.959
which has been increased
to 600 milliwatts...

14:36.125 --> 14:39.170
Just pay attention
to your business there.

14:39.337 --> 14:43.258
600 milliwatts, which in terms
of spatial-equivalency

14:43.424 --> 14:45.426
would be a 60 kilowatt unit.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.888
This is done because we have such
high efficiency...

15:00.650 --> 15:03.528
coupled with what would be
a common home carpet-sweeper.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.614
Would you bring up the biomed
on the specimen, please.

15:06.781 --> 15:10.702
Oxygen percentage, check.
Air tanks fully charged.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.248
Doppler phase translocator activated.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.961
State of the art.

15:20.128 --> 15:24.215
All personnel, we are now
at priority level one.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.967
Secure all stations.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.144
Environmental control systems, check.

15:38.229 --> 15:41.941
Gyro stabilization
XYZ coordinates, check.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.245
Laser subsystem analysis, check.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.624
Pod lockdown and rotation complete.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.418
Begin phase two alignment.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.509
Prepare for shield closure.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.487
- Lieutenant, do you read me?
- Rock and roll.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.156
Okay, stand by. I need final
confirmation from Biomed.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.783
Biomed complete.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.494
- And optoelectrical station three.
- Three check.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.287
- Station two.
- Two check.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.456
- And the MRD.
- Entry point plotted.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.458
Okay, TC, do you confirm
we're clear to proceed?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.460
Dr. Niles isn't here yet.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.547
Well, that's his trouble.
It's not mine. Nothing I can do.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.799
Okay, prepare PEM number one.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.553
Activate Photon echo Memory system.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.431
Insert PEM number one.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.268
Commencing PEM number one insertion.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.740
Open the pre-feed
to the hydroperc chamber.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.455
Pull up the display
on the photon densitometer.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.752
Stand by, Lieutenant.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.798
Insert PEM number two.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.054
These should have been
on my desk a week ago.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.858
Do you have any other papers
you haven't turned in?

17:58.703 --> 18:00.538
Pod activated.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.584
Microchip interlock complete.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.379
Hold onto your breakfast,
Lieutenant, This is it.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.964
Activate centrifuge.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.017
Minus 40.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.730
Commencing molecular
isolation and displacement.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.069
Minus 30.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.203
Minus 20.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.629
Minus ten.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.674
Nine, eight, seven,

18:52.841 --> 18:56.177
six, five, four, three,

18:56.344 --> 18:58.805
two, one.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.557
Ignition.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.461
Sequence completed.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.868
- Can I help you, fellows?
- Phone repair.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.703
Phone repair.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.624
Do you know anything about
phones being fixed today?

20:09.501 --> 20:12.003
Sorry, I don't...

20:17.383 --> 20:20.345
All technicians report
to the substation monitors.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.246
Prepare to interface with host organism.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.214
Synchronize life support system.

20:56.381 --> 20:59.259
Stand by, Lieutenant, we'll have you
inside Bugs in just a moment.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.177
Guys, I need help with this rodent.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.340
Look at this thing.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.808
Primitive. Definitely primitive.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.003
- Margaret?
- Ozzie.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.758
I see you've backed yourself
into a corner once again.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.939
Mr. Igoe... stop him.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.107
We need that syringe.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.213
Ozzie.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.757
Ozzie, what's the hell's
going on out there?

23:57.270 --> 24:00.190
Ozzie, am I being punished?

24:52.075 --> 24:54.869
Mr. Putter? Mr. Putter.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.580
Well, I certainly envy you.

24:57.747 --> 25:00.333
Fun, excitement, relaxation.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.877
No excitement. Doctor's orders.

25:03.044 --> 25:06.714
How about maybe
a little shipboard romance?

25:06.881 --> 25:09.759
Well, as long as it isn't too exciting.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.737
Hey!

26:57.242 --> 26:59.869
- Get some help.
- Somebody call security.

27:22.454 --> 27:24.519
Did you see that?

27:43.580 --> 27:45.248
Automatic pilot now functioning.

27:45.415 --> 27:48.293
Please give command code
for environmental adjust.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.448
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Jack, you're late.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.658
That's not good.
You know it's coupon day.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.911
Sorry Mr. Wormwood,
but you won't believe what happened.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.830
I don't want to hear about it.
Tell me later.

28:25.997 --> 28:28.791
Just punch in and get to work
at register five.

28:28.958 --> 28:32.879
- Yes.
- Smell this. Go on, smell it.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.856
What the hell are these things?
Fat cells?

28:56.110 --> 28:58.947
What the hell is going on out there?

29:00.031 --> 29:02.283
Mission control command, Do you read me?

29:03.743 --> 29:07.497
I think I blacked out.
Am I inside Bugs or what?

29:11.543 --> 29:13.378
Thanks, Craig.

29:13.545 --> 29:15.547
- You're late.
- I know.

29:15.713 --> 29:18.466
- How do I look?
- Like shit.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.927
- I'm still shaking.
- What happened?

29:21.094 --> 29:23.638
Had the most frightening
experience of my life.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.724
Talk about frightening experiences.
Have you ever tried slam dancing?

29:26.891 --> 29:28.393
Never mind.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.728
- So that's where you were.
- Huh?

29:30.895 --> 29:33.106
I hate to shock you,
but we had a date last night.

29:33.273 --> 29:35.066
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.610
Forgot? How could you forget?

29:37.777 --> 29:40.363
Jack, look, I've already told you.

29:40.530 --> 29:44.075
If you want to be part of my life,
you can't be hassling me about stuff.

29:44.242 --> 29:47.078
Wendy, I'm not a part of your life.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.962
Well?

29:58.298 --> 30:02.677
- I'm in a hurry.
- Yes, you are.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.971
Just add it up, will you?

30:06.598 --> 30:08.141
Ozzie, if you can hear me,

30:08.308 --> 30:10.602
I'm gonna try to restore
contact from your end

30:10.768 --> 30:13.480
by activating one of the
electromagnetic booster cells.

30:13.646 --> 30:14.856
Stand by.

30:25.992 --> 30:30.371
Gee, that's kind of pricey
for shampoo, ain't it?

30:30.538 --> 30:31.873
Ozzie!

30:35.043 --> 30:36.920
Oh, no.

30:37.086 --> 30:39.297
A hundred and twenty-eight
thousand dollars?

30:39.464 --> 30:42.091
Is that with or without the coupons?

30:46.095 --> 30:48.932
What have you done, Jack?
What have you done?

30:49.098 --> 30:50.892
- It's a dream.
- What?

30:51.059 --> 30:52.101
It's a dream.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.270
God, Jack, way to screw up!

30:54.437 --> 30:58.858
Listen, sweetie, I don't carry
that kind of cash around with me.

31:05.281 --> 31:08.243
No. Oh, no.

31:10.036 --> 31:13.581
- Oh, no.
- Get a hold of yourself, Jack.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.124
- I need some aspirin.
- What?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.377
Please I'm begging you for some aspirin!

31:17.544 --> 31:19.712
- Get your hands off my jacket!
- Here!

31:22.257 --> 31:24.843
Hey, I'm not buying that aspirin now!

31:25.009 --> 31:27.178
At $800 a bottle, who would want to?

31:27.345 --> 31:30.807
Jack. Jack you're becoming unglued.

31:30.974 --> 31:33.226
You're coming apart at the seams.

31:33.393 --> 31:37.188
Oh, my God, he's completely spaced out.

31:37.355 --> 31:38.648
All right, let me handle this.

31:41.025 --> 31:42.360
Jack.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.948
What the hell's that? Ozzie?

31:48.366 --> 31:51.202
Ozzie, I can't hear you.
I hope to hell you can hear me.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.622
I'm gonna proceed
with the mission as planned.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.457
I'm gonna go to auto pilot.

31:58.334 --> 32:02.589
Phase one: Optic Nerve Interface.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.841
Come on, baby, show me the way.

32:07.051 --> 32:10.180
"Please wait.
Environmental adjust required."

32:10.346 --> 32:12.724
What the hell's going...
Doesn't anything work?

32:12.891 --> 32:14.309
Pathway to optic nerve is as follows

32:14.476 --> 32:16.978
Superior gluteal vein to iliac vein,

32:17.145 --> 32:19.105
to inferior vena cava past right atrium,

32:19.272 --> 32:23.026
to superior vena cava
to jugular vein to optic chiasma.

32:23.193 --> 32:24.694
Let's drive.

32:36.414 --> 32:38.666
Entering bloodstream.

32:41.794 --> 32:46.216
Jack... you've always
been like a son to me.

32:46.382 --> 32:49.010
Well, a nephew, anyway.

32:50.428 --> 32:54.098
You've got a great future
in retail food marketing.

32:56.392 --> 33:01.564
I'd hate to see you throw it all away
by going psycho on us.

33:13.284 --> 33:16.183
- Oh, coffee. Great, thank you.
- I got it down the hall.

33:16.350 --> 33:19.123
- Smoking.
- Hmm? Mm.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.885
Deploying optic remote.

33:31.636 --> 33:33.346
Optic sensor armed and ready.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.181
Switch to manual trajectory control.

33:43.231 --> 33:45.316
Firing optic sensor.

33:56.786 --> 34:02.792
What's wrong, Jack?
Let me see. Let me see.

34:02.959 --> 34:05.753
Come on, where the hell's
the picture? Come on!

34:07.130 --> 34:08.965
All right, Oz!

34:10.300 --> 34:12.969
That's not Oz. Who the hell is that?

34:13.136 --> 34:14.929
Where's the lab technicians?

34:15.096 --> 34:17.056
Where's the lab?

34:17.223 --> 34:19.851
It was just so strange. It was like...

34:20.518 --> 34:22.020
someone had suddenly shoved

34:22.187 --> 34:24.397
a white-hot sewing needle
through the pupil of my eye.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.190
Oh, God!

34:28.193 --> 34:30.360
You stand up now, Jack.

34:33.364 --> 34:35.992
Did Bugs just stand up?
What's going on here?

34:36.159 --> 34:37.702
This can't be.

34:41.164 --> 34:42.706
I'm in a man!

34:43.833 --> 34:45.126
I'm in a strange man!

34:45.293 --> 34:47.962
I'll be a son of a bitch,
I'm in a strange man

34:48.129 --> 34:51.090
surrounded by strangers
in a strange room!

34:51.257 --> 34:54.092
You go home
and start your vacation today.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.262
- This afternoon, Jack.
- Thank you, sir.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.556
And you come back to us a new man.

34:59.849 --> 35:02.018
Do you mind if I use your phone?
Maybe I should phone my doctor.

35:02.185 --> 35:06.064
Go right ahead, Jack. What a good idea.

35:07.941 --> 35:09.567
Ozzie, what have you done to me?

35:09.734 --> 35:12.737
How the hell can I be inside a man?
I studied up on rabbits.

35:12.904 --> 35:14.864
I gotta talk to this guy.

35:15.031 --> 35:16.825
Pathway to middle ear is as follows...

35:23.373 --> 35:25.875
Now, miniaturization is achieved

35:26.042 --> 35:29.462
by pairing two 500 series
Photon Echo Memory Chips,

35:29.629 --> 35:32.632
or PEMs as we call them,
a controller and a remote.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.301
Only the Controller
is needed for miniaturization.

35:35.468 --> 35:38.596
But a combination of the two chips
must be used to re-enlarge.

35:48.231 --> 35:50.775
J. Putter, assistant manager.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.528
Find him.

36:28.271 --> 36:30.315
Approaching middle ear.

37:07.060 --> 37:10.355
Hello? Hello, can you hear me?

37:19.030 --> 37:22.867
Repeat. Repeat.
Respond if you can hear me.

37:25.870 --> 37:28.832
- Who, me?
- It works. I can hear you!

37:32.418 --> 37:34.379
Would you talk to me, please?

37:39.676 --> 37:41.719
Who are you? What's your name?

37:47.934 --> 37:49.894
What?

37:50.061 --> 37:53.022
- Are you talking to me?
- No.

37:54.274 --> 37:56.401
I'm not out there. I'm in here.

37:57.902 --> 38:00.363
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

38:01.364 --> 38:03.283
You didn't hear that then?

38:04.284 --> 38:07.453
No, I'm sorry I didn't hear anything.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.372
Are you feeling all right?

38:12.250 --> 38:16.045
Would I be in a doctor's office
if I was feeling all right?

38:16.212 --> 38:18.047
Look, pal, we have to talk.

38:18.214 --> 38:19.591
- No, we don't.
- Don't what?

38:19.757 --> 38:21.092
- Don't have to talk.
- Yes, we do.

38:21.259 --> 38:22.260
- We do?
- Do what?

38:22.427 --> 38:24.220
- Have to talk.
- Not unless you want to.

38:24.387 --> 38:28.099
I'm in here inside you!
Inside your body!

38:30.268 --> 38:31.895
Oh, God!

38:32.061 --> 38:36.441
Somebody help me. I'm possessed!

38:37.400 --> 38:38.776
Jack...

38:45.179 --> 38:47.076
Good news, Jack.

38:47.243 --> 38:50.955
I think we can rule out demonic
possession right off the bat.

38:51.122 --> 38:53.625
But this little voice is talking to me.

38:53.791 --> 38:55.001
See, that proves it.

38:55.168 --> 38:57.587
Demons talk through you, not to you.

39:00.465 --> 39:02.258
Jack, what are you doing?

39:02.425 --> 39:06.137
Well, I started to hyperventilate.
This usually does the trick.

39:06.304 --> 39:08.494
Let's see.

39:10.725 --> 39:13.102
- You're okay? You're not shaky?
- Now I'm fine.

39:13.269 --> 39:15.688
Thank God! A doctor!
Somebody'll understand.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.524
Tell your doctor
that I'm in the tympanic...

39:17.690 --> 39:19.400
- I'm right inside your ear.
- It's happening right now.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.945
- I hear it now.
- Okay, okay, take it easy, Jack.

39:22.111 --> 39:24.823
Just sit down and I'll check into it.

39:24.989 --> 39:27.659
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Tell him!

39:28.618 --> 39:30.370
What are you deaf? Tell him!

39:30.537 --> 39:33.581
Just relax, Jack.
Let's see what's going on in here.

39:34.582 --> 39:37.043
I'm blind! Oh, God!

39:37.210 --> 39:39.128
Now it's talking about God.

39:40.463 --> 39:45.343
Jack... you seem to be experiencing
some sort of theistic hysteria.

39:46.344 --> 39:48.555
How do you treat that?

39:48.721 --> 39:51.182
Well, the medieval remedy

39:51.349 --> 39:54.477
was to flay the skin off your body
with brands of fire.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.189
I have no idea
what the current thinking is.

40:05.029 --> 40:09.367
It's just a little theistic hysteria,
which is nothing.

40:36.561 --> 40:37.604
I can see!

40:37.770 --> 40:39.898
Oh, thank God! I can see!

40:40.064 --> 40:41.566
- Jack.
- It knows my name.

40:41.733 --> 40:43.610
Jack.

40:43.776 --> 40:46.446
- Jack, we have to talk.
- No!

40:46.613 --> 40:48.072
Jack, we have ourselves
a little problem here.

40:48.239 --> 40:52.952
I wonder what's on the television?
TV is so much fun around now.

40:53.119 --> 40:56.623
- Jack! Pay attention!
- Oh, good. This is a good one.

40:56.789 --> 40:59.876
Jack, you can't watch TV.
We have to talk.

41:00.043 --> 41:02.212
Oh, no, I'm inside a guy
who likes game shows.

41:02.378 --> 41:04.005
Try a vowel.

41:04.172 --> 41:05.757
All right, Jack,
you leave me no other choice.

41:05.924 --> 41:07.926
I'm gonna hit you with
my electro-magnetic booster.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.972
Okay, buddy boy, here we go.

41:19.395 --> 41:21.272
Fire! Fire!

41:23.441 --> 41:26.236
Hey, Jack, you want to watch TV?
Watch this.

41:28.279 --> 41:30.949
- Primary coil overload.
- Fire! Fire!

41:40.458 --> 41:42.168
Oh, Jack...

41:42.335 --> 41:45.839
You see that I'm real.
You do believe me now, don't you?

41:46.005 --> 41:47.298
Huh?

41:47.465 --> 41:49.884
I... I don't know what to believe.

41:51.344 --> 41:54.472
Believe it, Jack.
Believe it because it's true.

41:55.682 --> 41:58.017
Now, I want you to listen to me
and I want you to listen good.

41:58.184 --> 41:59.519
- All right?
- Yes.

41:59.686 --> 42:02.981
Because we're in this together
and we got to help each other out.

42:04.232 --> 42:06.442
You don't work at the lab, do you?

42:06.609 --> 42:09.112
Lab? No, I work at Safeway.

42:09.988 --> 42:12.824
And you don't know anything
about the experiment?

42:12.991 --> 42:14.450
What experiment?

42:15.201 --> 42:16.536
Oh, God!

42:16.703 --> 42:19.789
- The miniaturization experiment.
- No.

42:20.999 --> 42:25.503
Jack... my name is
Lieutenant Tuck Pendleton.

42:25.670 --> 42:27.505
I've been miniaturized.

42:27.672 --> 42:31.050
I was supposed to be injected
into the body of a laboratory rabbit,

42:31.217 --> 42:34.554
and somehow I got inside you instead.

42:34.721 --> 42:36.181
What do you mean, "somehow"? How?

42:36.347 --> 42:41.644
All I know is I was inside a syringe
and now I'm inside you.

42:41.811 --> 42:43.480
Syringe...

42:53.573 --> 42:56.201
- Are you Jack Potter?
- Putter.

42:56.367 --> 42:59.579
- Putter. This yours?
- Uh, yes.

42:59.746 --> 43:01.581
- I'm from Cook Travel Agency.
- Oh.

43:01.748 --> 43:03.416
- Wanna sign on number 12.
- Okay.

43:03.583 --> 43:05.793
I think these are probably cruise
tickets, if I'm not mistaken.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.378
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:07.545 --> 43:09.422
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

43:09.589 --> 43:11.216
Can I use your phone?

43:11.382 --> 43:13.551
Uh... sure, go ahead.

43:18.973 --> 43:21.059
Thanks, appreciate it.

43:21.226 --> 43:22.685
Shot your TV out, huh man?

43:23.061 --> 43:24.562
Just like Elvis.

43:24.729 --> 43:27.774
You know, you're a lucky guy,
going on a cruise.

43:29.609 --> 43:32.403
- Taking your roommate?
- I don't have a roommate.

43:32.570 --> 43:34.906
I thought
I heard you talking to someone.

43:35.073 --> 43:37.450
Don't trust him. He's not a messenger.

43:37.617 --> 43:39.744
- Yeah, I made the drop.
-  How do you know?

43:39.911 --> 43:43.081
Gut reaction. Get out.
Get out right now!

43:43.581 --> 43:46.626
Piece of cake. Where you going, man?

43:46.793 --> 43:48.878
- Uh...
- Grab it! Grab it!

43:53.383 --> 43:55.927
Jack, your pulse rate,
I'm going too fast!

44:05.520 --> 44:08.356
Jack! Bring your knee up right now,
kick him where it counts!

44:09.649 --> 44:12.068
Now hit him! Run!

44:25.665 --> 44:27.667
Tuck, what's going on?

44:32.881 --> 44:37.260
Jack, you did real good.
Try and calm down.

44:37.427 --> 44:38.928
I've got a little problem here.

44:39.095 --> 44:41.681
I'm gonna go off radio contact
for a minute.

44:41.848 --> 44:43.016
Shit!

44:53.276 --> 44:55.695
Approaching tricuspid
valve of heart. Do not enter.

44:55.862 --> 44:58.364
- Do not enter heart.
- Back, baby. Back, baby.

45:03.077 --> 45:04.996
Turbo thrusters at maximum.

45:10.043 --> 45:12.837
Warning.
Cardiovascular threshold exceeded.

45:25.308 --> 45:28.019
Cardiac arrest imminent.
Take evasive action.

45:37.195 --> 45:38.988
Just a little further!

45:43.827 --> 45:45.370
This won't hurt a bit, Jack.

45:48.581 --> 45:52.710
Up! Up! Up! That's it! Let's go!

46:03.429 --> 46:05.765
That's one hell of a pump
you got there, Jack.

46:05.932 --> 46:09.644
- Where have you been?
- Never mind. Let's get to the lab.

46:10.603 --> 46:13.523
You mean to tell me
that he can actually talk to you?

46:13.690 --> 46:15.650
Yes. And I can talk to him.

46:15.817 --> 46:18.736
And also, he's able
to see everything that I see.

46:18.903 --> 46:20.655
He's patched into the optic nerve
and the eardrum.

46:20.822 --> 46:22.115
That was part of the experiment.

46:22.282 --> 46:24.492
To see if a miniaturized
human could make

46:24.659 --> 46:27.162
audio and visual contact
with its host organism.

46:27.328 --> 46:31.082
- Doc, this is a guy, not a bunny.
- But the computer doesn't know that.

46:31.249 --> 46:34.794
It simply reads the environment
and makes the proper adjustments.

46:34.961 --> 46:38.006
- Can you see me Lieutenant Pendleton?
- Yeah, I can see you.

46:38.173 --> 46:39.507
Yes, he can.

46:40.758 --> 46:43.887
Good work! Job well done!

46:44.053 --> 46:48.141
Good work! I can't believe this!
Find out what went wrong.

46:48.308 --> 46:51.561
Excuse me, Lieutenant Pendleton
is wondering what went wrong.

46:51.728 --> 46:53.521
- Well...
- I'll tell you what went wrong.

46:53.688 --> 46:56.065
You threw in with a bunch of eggheads
who don't know squat about security.

46:56.232 --> 46:58.401
- That's what went wrong.
- Thanks for the hot tip.

46:58.568 --> 47:00.737
But don't worry, Tuck, old' buddy.

47:00.904 --> 47:03.907
We're going to do everything possible
to get you out of this... civilian.

47:04.073 --> 47:06.326
You better,
you two-faced son of a bitch.

47:07.660 --> 47:10.663
- Tuck says, "Thank you."
- Yeah.

47:10.830 --> 47:12.165
Excuse us a minute.

47:12.332 --> 47:15.293
- Let me talk to you outside.
- Yeah. Uh...

47:15.460 --> 47:17.837
Stay here. Both of you.

47:18.004 --> 47:21.007
Oh... That's good.

47:22.008 --> 47:23.510
Well, you're home free now.

47:23.676 --> 47:25.762
Oh, yeah?
I never trusted Pete Blanchard.

47:25.929 --> 47:27.722
Can you see where they went?

47:29.933 --> 47:32.393
- Uh... Yes, hold on, yes.
- Yeah.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.729
All right, look directly at them.
Don't turn your head.

47:34.896 --> 47:37.190
I think I can beef up
the reception a little bit.

47:38.274 --> 47:39.901
- I've been trying to...
- Ahh!

47:40.068 --> 47:41.820
...explain to you exactly
what's going on.

47:41.986 --> 47:43.196
Explain it to me then.

47:43.363 --> 47:45.824
We're not the only ones
working towards miniaturization.

47:45.990 --> 47:47.742
Don't you think I know that, Niles?

47:47.909 --> 47:50.495
- Hey, I can hear them.
- I know. Shut up and listen.

47:50.662 --> 47:51.830
Sorry.

47:51.996 --> 47:55.208
But we are the first to perfect
the tricky re-enlargement process...

47:55.375 --> 47:58.628
by using two chips.
One of the chips is in the pod.

47:58.795 --> 48:00.129
And the other has been stolen.

48:00.296 --> 48:01.881
Now, what do we do to we save Pendleton?

48:02.048 --> 48:04.467
- Recover the stolen chip.
- Don't you have duplicates?

48:04.634 --> 48:06.135
No! They're prototypes!

48:06.302 --> 48:08.012
That's thinking ahead, Niles.

48:08.179 --> 48:09.639
We can make duplicates, of course.

48:09.806 --> 48:12.851
- But not by nine tomorrow morning.
- What happens at nine o' clock?

48:13.017 --> 48:16.729
By nine o' clock,
his air supply runs out.

48:16.896 --> 48:18.982
That is no problem.

48:19.149 --> 48:21.651
All he's gotta do is take the pod
to the guy's lungs,

48:21.818 --> 48:23.278
open the hatch and breathe in
all the air he needs.

48:23.444 --> 48:24.988
He can't open the hatch!

48:25.155 --> 48:26.948
The sudden change in the cabin pressure

48:27.115 --> 48:28.992
would cause the pod
to explode like a balloon.

48:29.159 --> 48:31.035
That's right, Einstein.

48:31.202 --> 48:33.913
- Then we don't have to do anything.
- What do you mean?

48:34.080 --> 48:37.000
The stolen chip is useless
without the one inside the pod,

48:37.167 --> 48:38.543
and we've got that one.

48:38.710 --> 48:40.545
You build your duplicates.

48:40.712 --> 48:44.007
It doesn't matter how long it takes.
Then we'll be back in business.

48:44.174 --> 48:47.677
- And what about Pendleton?
- We can't save him. That's too bad.

48:47.844 --> 48:49.596
Thanks, Pete.

48:49.762 --> 48:51.806
Maybe we can use him.

48:51.973 --> 48:55.101
Bring the perpetrators
out into the open.

48:55.894 --> 48:57.228
- Find it?
- Yeah.

48:57.395 --> 49:00.106
Put it on. Keys are in the pocket.
Car's out back.

49:00.273 --> 49:01.524
- You see that door?
- Yeah.

49:01.691 --> 49:02.984
Use it.

49:04.986 --> 49:06.404
What're you waiting on?

49:06.571 --> 49:10.200
Don't rush me, okay? Just...
be quiet and let me think this through.

49:10.366 --> 49:12.952
Jack, excuse me, but I want you to
factor this into your thinking:

49:13.161 --> 49:15.622
you heard the guy,
my air supply is running out.

49:15.788 --> 49:17.582
If you don't help me,

49:17.749 --> 49:20.502
you're gonna wind up with
this miniaturized submersible pod

49:20.668 --> 49:22.086
floating around your insides

49:22.253 --> 49:25.423
with this teeny, tiny
human skeleton at the helm.

49:27.133 --> 49:28.760
Not a pretty thought.

49:29.969 --> 49:31.137
All right.

49:31.304 --> 49:34.599
- But you have to do something for me.
- Anything. Let's just go.

49:36.476 --> 49:39.813
The red Mustang convertible.
You see it? It's over there.

49:42.941 --> 49:45.527
Careful! This isn't a Honda.

49:45.693 --> 49:47.570
There's 500 horses
underneath this baby, okay?

49:49.197 --> 49:52.617
Use the clutch! It's a five-speed stick!

49:55.537 --> 49:57.205
Mr. Putter, we...

50:02.669 --> 50:04.629
Oh, that's great, doc!

50:07.465 --> 50:09.008
- No pain.
- What?

50:09.175 --> 50:12.428
That's the thing
that I want from you. No pain.

50:12.595 --> 50:16.266
I mean just... don't do
anything weird in there, okay?

50:16.432 --> 50:21.855
Don't... cause an embolism
or an aneurysm or...

50:22.021 --> 50:25.859
accidentally sever my spinal cord
and just kinda go, "Oh, sorry."

50:26.025 --> 50:27.402
Do you know what I mean?

50:27.569 --> 50:30.196
- Okay, no pain.
- Thank you.

50:37.328 --> 50:38.872
Home sweet home.

50:39.038 --> 50:40.039
Is this where you live?

50:40.373 --> 50:44.335
Yeah, ain't it great?
I call it user friendly.

50:45.503 --> 50:46.671
What's this thing?

50:46.838 --> 50:49.507
That? That's just something else
from Vector-Scope that doesn't work.

50:49.674 --> 50:51.176
Never mind that.

50:51.342 --> 50:54.262
I need a drink. How about you?

50:54.429 --> 50:57.557
Drink? No... I don't drink.

50:57.724 --> 51:01.227
You do now, because I can't have a
drink unless you have a drink.

51:01.394 --> 51:02.562
- Get the picture?
- Oh.

51:02.729 --> 51:05.690
See that table in front of you
with the motorcycle engine on top?

51:05.857 --> 51:07.859
- Yeah.
- Check the cylinder.

51:08.943 --> 51:11.279
- Okay.
- All right.

51:13.490 --> 51:15.742
- Yeah?
- Empty.

51:15.909 --> 51:17.577
Oh. Oh, yeah, right. Uh...

51:17.744 --> 51:20.038
Check the sink with the big fish in it.

51:20.205 --> 51:23.750
- A bottle of Southern Comfort?
- Yeah, it's here.

51:23.917 --> 51:25.710
All right, here's what I want you to do.

51:25.877 --> 51:28.546
I want you to take
a big, old tug on that baby

51:28.713 --> 51:30.548
and I'll do the rest, all right?

51:32.383 --> 51:35.136
And we're gonna drink this one to Ozzie.

51:35.303 --> 51:39.891
A good man who tried to save my ass
by injecting me into yours.

51:41.851 --> 51:43.269
To Ozzie.

51:50.068 --> 51:51.861
Come on, lucky flask.

52:02.808 --> 52:04.666
Klahoma! Taya!

52:08.628 --> 52:10.547
Great, Jack.

52:12.257 --> 52:14.300
When things are at their darkest, pal,

52:14.467 --> 52:17.512
it's a brave man
who can kick back and party.

52:18.138 --> 52:21.474
Jack, let the good times roll.

52:46.708 --> 52:48.251
Whoo!

53:31.794 --> 53:33.463
I didn't know dancing
could be so much fun.

53:33.630 --> 53:35.965
You ought to try it
with a girl sometime.

53:37.217 --> 53:40.011
You mean someone like this?

53:41.679 --> 53:43.097
Yeah.

53:44.390 --> 53:45.892
Somebody like that.

53:46.059 --> 53:47.435
You know what's weird?

53:47.602 --> 53:51.648
You are seeing parts of my body...

53:51.815 --> 53:54.234
that I will never get to see.

53:54.400 --> 53:56.820
Believe me,
you're not missing all that much.

53:57.862 --> 53:59.697
The gastric mucosa.

54:01.574 --> 54:06.246
Intestinal villi. Pulmonary alveoli.

54:07.914 --> 54:09.874
Faraway places with...

54:10.750 --> 54:13.753
strange-sounding names.

54:13.920 --> 54:16.172
Hey, Jack. Jack!

54:16.339 --> 54:18.758
Go to the mirror
in the bedroom, will you?

54:19.592 --> 54:22.095
- Why?
- I just realized I don't know

54:22.262 --> 54:24.722
what the hell you look like
from the outside.

54:25.223 --> 54:27.183
Sure.

54:31.371 --> 54:32.897
Are you drunk?

54:33.064 --> 54:36.276
No, I just got up too fast,
so I was a little dizzy.

54:36.442 --> 54:38.611
Yeah, yeah, right.

54:38.778 --> 54:40.613
- Is that you?
- Yeah, that's me.

54:40.780 --> 54:42.907
- Look at you.
- Yeah, look at me.

54:43.116 --> 54:45.076
Go to the mirror. Come on.

54:47.954 --> 54:49.747
- How's this?
- A little too close, Jack.

54:49.914 --> 54:52.584
Too close? What's this? Is this good?

54:52.750 --> 54:56.546
You know what?
We're going to need a lot more help.

54:57.755 --> 55:01.801
- Can you drive? Is your head clear?
- Yes, yes.

55:01.968 --> 55:03.761
Slap yourself in the face.

55:04.804 --> 55:07.140
- What?
- Your face. Slap it.

55:10.143 --> 55:11.311
Harder!

55:12.353 --> 55:13.813
Again!

55:15.148 --> 55:17.192
- Sober yet?
- One more time.

55:20.111 --> 55:23.072
- Okay! How does it feel?
- It feels good.

55:23.239 --> 55:26.117
The Jack Putter machine, zero defects.

55:30.830 --> 55:32.916
God help us.

55:33.458 --> 55:35.919
"Espionage in Silicon Valley."

55:36.085 --> 55:38.922
"The Buying and Selling
of Advanced Technology."

55:39.130 --> 55:42.008
It sounded like Sunday
supplement stuff to me then.

55:42.175 --> 55:44.260
And that's how it sounds to me now.

55:44.427 --> 55:47.514
Lydia... will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

55:47.680 --> 55:51.518
When people get murdered,
that's when we'll put it in Metro.

55:51.684 --> 55:53.603
Harry, people are getting murdered.

55:53.770 --> 55:55.438
Huh?

55:55.605 --> 55:57.065
A scientist named Ozzie Wexler

55:57.232 --> 55:58.983
was gunned down this morning
in a shopping mall.

55:59.150 --> 56:01.486
- Nobody saw who did it.
- What do you know about him?

56:01.653 --> 56:02.862
So far more than the police.

56:03.029 --> 56:05.615
He worked for a lab called
Vector-Scope located near the mall.

56:05.782 --> 56:07.700
Something gets stolen maybe?

56:07.867 --> 56:10.495
I don't know. Vector-Scope is
locked up tighter than a drum, why?

56:10.662 --> 56:12.163
The Cowboy.

56:12.330 --> 56:13.790
- The Cowboy?
- Who's the Cowboy?

56:13.957 --> 56:15.458
- Is he here now?
- On his way.

56:15.625 --> 56:17.252
- Talk to me.
- TWA flight 607,

56:17.418 --> 56:20.004
arriving San Francisco International
4 o'clock this afternoon.

56:20.171 --> 56:22.173
Will you talk to me?
What am I, chopped liver around here?

56:22.340 --> 56:23.675
Who's the Cowboy?

56:45.738 --> 56:49.075
I'm sorry, sir, you're gonna
have to extinguish that cigar.

57:00.503 --> 57:02.046
Mmm!

57:02.213 --> 57:07.010
There is nothing like a good cigar,
eh, partner?

57:24.736 --> 57:27.530
- Hey! There she is!
- Where?

57:27.697 --> 57:30.074
Behind you, I saw her
out of the corner of your eye.

57:30.241 --> 57:32.911
Honk the horn! Honk the horn!

57:36.831 --> 57:39.209
- Pull over!
- I am.

57:39.375 --> 57:40.585
Hey!

57:40.752 --> 57:43.087
- You see her?
- Yeah.

57:43.254 --> 57:45.507
- What do you think you're doing?
- Uh...

57:45.673 --> 57:48.760
This is Tuck Pendleton's car,
does he know you have this car?

57:48.927 --> 57:51.721
No! He'd sooner trust somebody with
his life than with this car.

57:51.888 --> 57:53.556
All right, here we go.

57:55.141 --> 57:57.685
You're wearing Tuck's jacket.
Why are you wearing...?

57:57.852 --> 58:00.772
- Lydia, shut up and listen.
- Lydia, shut up and listen.

58:02.023 --> 58:03.858
Boy, you said that good.

58:05.443 --> 58:09.322
Look, uh... Tuck's in trouble.
He needs your help.

58:11.407 --> 58:15.829
Tuck's being held for ransom?

58:15.995 --> 58:18.498
In a manner of speaking, yes.

58:19.582 --> 58:22.919
We need a certain microchip
to get him back.

58:23.086 --> 58:26.005
Unfortunately it was taken
from Vector-Scope labs this morning.

58:26.172 --> 58:29.467
So there was a break-in! How did Tuck...

58:30.969 --> 58:35.431
- How did you get involved in this?
- Me? Uh... It's a long story.

58:35.598 --> 58:37.642
Good. I'm a reporter.
I love long stories.

58:41.020 --> 58:43.273
Don't let her
take control over the conversation.

58:43.439 --> 58:47.944
Be aggressive. Dominate her.
Don't be a wuss-puss. Be me.

58:51.990 --> 58:56.327
Look, Lydia, you're just
gonna have to trust me, okay?

58:56.494 --> 58:57.996
There's not a lot of time
for explanations.

58:58.163 --> 58:59.873
We only have until
nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

59:00.039 --> 59:02.167
- That's good.
- Nine o'clock tomorrow morning?

59:02.333 --> 59:04.085
Can't we negotiate for more time?

59:04.502 --> 59:06.296
- No, no. No, we...
- Then where is he?

59:06.462 --> 59:09.007
- Where are they keeping him?
- Where?

59:09.174 --> 59:10.300
Yeah.

59:10.466 --> 59:13.553
Close by. You know, in the area.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.890
In the immediate area, vicinity.

59:17.056 --> 59:18.850
- It's difficult to know...
- Who has him?

59:22.395 --> 59:25.398
Would you excuse me for one second?
I'll be right back.

59:29.569 --> 59:31.321
I blew it. I can't handle her.

59:31.488 --> 59:34.365
No. You didn't do so bad.
She's a tough cookie.

59:34.532 --> 59:36.201
Yeah, well. She's a beautiful
tough cookie.

59:36.367 --> 59:38.077
You're a lucky guy.

59:38.244 --> 59:41.206
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. I just hate this.

59:41.372 --> 59:44.292
Why can't we tell her the truth?
She might even believe us.

59:44.459 --> 59:47.921
No, besides it's
humiliating being this small.

59:48.087 --> 59:49.839
What's so bad about being small?

59:50.006 --> 59:52.217
You don't have to be small forever.

59:52.383 --> 59:55.261
Play with it, pal, but don't talk to it.

59:55.428 --> 59:56.763
Who was that?

59:57.597 --> 59:59.182
Never mind.

01:00:00.767 --> 01:00:04.229
- Tuck!
- Yeah?

01:00:04.395 --> 01:00:05.480
Just checking.

01:00:16.241 --> 01:00:17.492
Hold it.

01:00:18.576 --> 01:00:23.998
This is a Taser gun,
deploying a charge of 20,000 volts.

01:00:24.165 --> 01:00:28.378
It will immobilize you for 15 minutes
and in all probability

01:00:28.545 --> 01:00:32.465
will render you unconscious as well,
so I would let go of that man!

01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:35.385
No!

01:00:36.219 --> 01:00:38.138
Electrical system overload!

01:00:44.602 --> 01:00:46.354
Somebody call the police!

01:00:47.438 --> 01:00:49.440
Jack.

01:00:49.607 --> 01:00:52.443
Jack, are you all right?
We had a massive power surge.

01:01:25.977 --> 01:01:28.897
Jack, what is going on?
Your heart rate's going way down.

01:01:29.063 --> 01:01:30.773
Talk to me.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.651
I'm... f-f-f...

01:01:33.818 --> 01:01:37.989
Jack! You had me worried.
I thought I'd lost you there, kid.

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:40.200
Where are we,
some kind of a meat locker?

01:01:40.366 --> 01:01:43.286
I'm... freezing.

01:01:43.453 --> 01:01:44.787
You're freezing?

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:50.126
Jack, what is that loud clicking sound?

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:15.318
Mr. Scrimshaw?

01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:34.170
Jack, who are these people?
Where are we?

01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:35.964
Jack?

01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:44.556
Dr. Canker, get in here!

01:02:50.895 --> 01:02:52.522
This is a doctor?

01:02:58.153 --> 01:02:59.237
Well?

01:03:00.738 --> 01:03:02.532
Mild hypothermia.

01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:03.700
We need him alive.

01:03:05.451 --> 01:03:08.413
Oh, yes. He should be alive.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.081
Bring a blanket.

01:03:10.248 --> 01:03:11.916
Let me take care of him.

01:03:13.209 --> 01:03:14.752
I know how to warm him up.

01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:20.592
Knock it off, Margaret.
You're riding in the Subzero.

01:03:20.758 --> 01:03:22.260
Very well.

01:03:26.639 --> 01:03:31.102
- Aren't you riding in the limo?
- No, go ahead.

01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:36.274
I'm staying back here
with my friend, Jack.

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:55.418
Nuclear weapons, Jack.

01:03:57.086 --> 01:04:00.340
They mean nothing. Everybody's got 'em.

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:04.177
Nobody has the balls to use them.
Am I right?

01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:08.640
"Space," you say. Space is a flop.

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:10.517
Didn't you know that?

01:04:10.683 --> 01:04:14.604
An endless junkyard of orbiting debris.

01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:17.315
Ah, but...

01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:19.484
miniaturization, Jack!

01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:21.486
That's the ticket.

01:04:21.653 --> 01:04:25.031
That's the edge that
everybody's been looking for.

01:04:25.198 --> 01:04:27.450
Who will have that edge, Jack?

01:04:27.617 --> 01:04:31.329
What country
will control miniaturization?

01:04:33.998 --> 01:04:38.461
Frankly, I don't give a shit.
I'm only in this for the money.

01:04:38.628 --> 01:04:42.465
And that's why, Jack,
we've got to get that little pod

01:04:42.632 --> 01:04:44.968
out from inside of you!

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:50.974
This guy's definitely not operating
on all eight cylinders, Jack.

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:59.232
You know Jack, sitting here,
freezing as we are,

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:01.609
I'm reminded of the year
that I spent working

01:05:01.776 --> 01:05:04.112
in the great gold fields of Alaska.

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:08.158
Jack, glance around slowly
so I can get a lay of the land.

01:05:08.324 --> 01:05:10.577
- I was a young man then...
- Come on.

01:05:10.743 --> 01:05:13.371
...much younger than yourself.
But twice as big.

01:05:13.538 --> 01:05:15.707
Hold it, wait. Go back to the doors.

01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:18.042
- Yeah.
- Those were memorable times.

01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:22.630
Okay, Jack.
This is it. The doors are unlocked.

01:05:22.797 --> 01:05:25.049
- I learned the ways of the Eskimo...
- This is your moment, Jack.

01:05:25.216 --> 01:05:27.051
It all comes down to this.

01:05:27.218 --> 01:05:30.054
You're not the same man
you were this morning, are you Jack?

01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:33.850
You're better, you're stronger.
You're a man in control of destiny!

01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:35.560
Psych yourself up, Jack!

01:05:35.727 --> 01:05:37.604
See yourself opening the doors, Jack!

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:39.814
See yourself jumping
from the truck, Jack!

01:05:39.981 --> 01:05:42.150
You're not going to bag groceries
all your life, are you, Jack?

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:45.904
Are ya? See yourself being a hero!
Psych yourself up!

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.239
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo! Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

01:05:48.406 --> 01:05:50.742
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo!
Can you do it, Jack?

01:05:50.909 --> 01:05:53.161
Can you see it, Jack? Can you see it?!

01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:54.454
- Yes!
- Mm?

01:05:54.621 --> 01:05:57.165
- I can see it!
- No, not yet!

01:05:57.332 --> 01:06:00.084
Wait until it stops!

01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.212
Come back here, you fool!

01:06:04.506 --> 01:06:06.758
Whoa, Jack!

01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:12.430
Jack, do you see that truck?

01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:19.062
Come in here, you Safeway clerk!

01:06:25.902 --> 01:06:27.570
You're scaring me, Jack.

01:06:30.448 --> 01:06:31.908
Igoe!

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:34.744
Igoe!

01:06:42.293 --> 01:06:44.671
Putter, don't be a puss, get in here!

01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:51.886
That's my car! It's Lydia!

01:06:52.053 --> 01:06:54.013
We're gonna jump on the car, Jack.

01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:58.184
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy.
Come on! Come on!

01:06:58.351 --> 01:07:00.937
Wait! Whoa!

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:03.565
Igoe! Stop the truck!

01:07:06.619 --> 01:07:08.319
Get closer!

01:07:09.654 --> 01:07:11.281
Jack!

01:07:11.447 --> 01:07:12.574
- Jack!
- What?

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.659
What do you think you're doing?

01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:17.036
- What do you think I'm doing?
- Get in the car!

01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:20.081
I'm trying to get in the car!

01:07:25.044 --> 01:07:27.255
Get in this car, right now!

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:36.264
Jack, jump in the car!

01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:38.558
Jump in the car, Jack!

01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:40.310
You can do it!

01:07:47.233 --> 01:07:48.902
Oh, God!

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.779
Jack, I love you!

01:07:51.946 --> 01:07:54.470
Way to go, Jack!

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.245
What exactly are we doing here?

01:07:59.412 --> 01:08:01.581
- We're waiting for someone.
- Oh.

01:08:03.583 --> 01:08:05.418
Who are we waiting for?

01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:07.086
The Cowboy.

01:08:08.213 --> 01:08:10.423
I've been tracking his movements
for months.

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:13.927
He got to the airport an hour ago,
and he always stays here.

01:08:14.093 --> 01:08:16.220
I have a feeling he's gonna
lead us to that chip we need.

01:08:16.386 --> 01:08:18.389
Hey, knock it off!

01:08:18.555 --> 01:08:20.767
Uh... why do you think that?

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:22.685
Because he's a fence.

01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:26.104
He deals in stolen Western technology
almost exclusively,

01:08:26.272 --> 01:08:29.149
which he then sells overseas
to the highest bidder.

01:08:30.276 --> 01:08:32.821
Who do you think introduced Velcro
to the Persian Gulf?

01:08:32.987 --> 01:08:35.448
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:08:37.951 --> 01:08:41.787
There he is, perfect timing.
We're checking in.

01:08:41.955 --> 01:08:44.249
Let me get the suitcase
out of the trunk.

01:08:44.415 --> 01:08:46.626
It's much less suspicious
if we have a suitcase.

01:08:49.045 --> 01:08:50.921
How did you know this was here?

01:08:51.089 --> 01:08:53.258
Oh, Tuck always keeps
a packed suitcase in the trunk,

01:08:53.424 --> 01:08:55.969
just in case he wakes up
in a strange place.

01:08:57.428 --> 01:09:01.265
Oh, no. She knows about the suitcase.

01:09:01.432 --> 01:09:02.975
Margaret.

01:09:03.143 --> 01:09:07.397
The Cowboy is in town
and we don't have the other chip.

01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:12.484
I'm awfully busy right now, Victor.
I'll have to call you back.

01:09:12.652 --> 01:09:14.904
Just get me that chip!

I tipped the desk clerk
$100 for this room

01:10:06.873 --> 01:10:08.791
so we could hear every move
that he makes.

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:11.336
Now, when he leaves the hotel,
we go, too.

01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:13.296
- What if he just stays in?
- No, he won't.

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:14.923
He loves this club called the Inferno.

01:10:15.089 --> 01:10:16.925
The man does not sleep.

01:10:17.091 --> 01:10:19.719
That guy in the truck said his name
was Scrimshaw, right?

01:10:19.886 --> 01:10:22.388
Hey, I told you to cut that out.
What are you looking at?

01:10:22.555 --> 01:10:23.932
I thought you were a gentleman.

01:10:24.098 --> 01:10:25.934
Come on Tuck, what do you expect?

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:32.357
She has the cutest little overbite,
don't you think?

01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:37.362
It gives her mouth this adorable
pouty expression that's so sweet.

01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:38.947
I know what she looks like.

01:10:39.113 --> 01:10:42.033
What exactly is the deal
between you two, anyway?

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.661
Never mind, it's none of your business.

01:10:44.828 --> 01:10:47.372
Hey, Tuck, listen, I really could use
a change of clothes.

01:10:47.539 --> 01:10:49.249
Mind if I just dip into your suitcase?

01:10:49.415 --> 01:10:53.711
Dip all you like,
nothing's going to fit you.

01:10:53.878 --> 01:10:57.590
Legal counsel
to reputed organized crime figures.

01:10:57.757 --> 01:11:01.052
Administrator of four
teamster patient funds,

01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:03.847
suspected of black market arms dealing,

01:11:04.013 --> 01:11:06.975
yet somehow
he always keeps his nose clean.

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:09.727
Jeez. Anything else, Duane?

01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:15.525
Yeah, they say he has Jimmy Hoffa's
watch in his desk as a souvenir.

01:11:22.282 --> 01:11:24.659
Oxygen reserve at 60 percent.

01:11:24.826 --> 01:11:26.536
Twenty-three hundred.

01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:31.207
We be cool.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.042
Jack, Scrimshaw is...

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.297
How do I look?

01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:41.593
What's the matter?

01:11:43.219 --> 01:11:45.013
Nothing. Um...

01:11:46.097 --> 01:11:51.060
You just remind me of a time
when Tuck wore this jacket.

01:11:51.227 --> 01:11:53.021
Oh, yeah.

01:11:54.272 --> 01:11:57.066
It was the night we first met.

01:11:57.233 --> 01:11:59.903
You were doing that article
about me, and...

01:12:00.069 --> 01:12:03.656
we had dinner and talked
until three in the morning.

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:08.536
I got drunk, threw up and fell down
a manhole walking you home.

01:12:08.703 --> 01:12:12.248
It looks like you're pretty
hung up on the guy then, huh?

01:12:16.127 --> 01:12:18.004
How well do you know Tuck?

01:12:19.255 --> 01:12:22.675
Well, we're very close, actually.

01:12:22.842 --> 01:12:24.677
Did he, um...

01:12:25.762 --> 01:12:27.263
talk about me?

01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:33.144
Uh... I find that Tuck tends to be

01:12:33.311 --> 01:12:35.855
a little tight-lipped
when it comes to women.

01:12:36.022 --> 01:12:38.858
Oh, you knock it off!

01:12:39.025 --> 01:12:42.737
But if I were Tuck,
I'd talk about you all the time.

01:12:43.988 --> 01:12:46.157
Yeah. Right.

01:12:46.324 --> 01:12:48.201
Oh, the Cowboy is leaving.

01:13:14.686 --> 01:13:17.188
Shouldn't I...? I think I need a...

01:13:22.527 --> 01:13:24.571
Jack?

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:30.368
Jack! It's Wendy! My God, Jack!

01:13:30.535 --> 01:13:32.078
- Wendy!
- Look at you!

01:13:32.245 --> 01:13:34.539
- Well, look at you!
- I'm going in before we lose him.

01:13:34.706 --> 01:13:36.332
- All right.
- I'm with him!

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.042
She's with me.

01:14:16.247 --> 01:14:17.749
Hey, Cowboy!

01:14:42.315 --> 01:14:43.733
Oh!

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:02.168
I can't believe it, Jack!

01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:05.171
This is so exciting! Oh!

01:15:05.338 --> 01:15:07.841
How long have you been leading
this double life?

01:15:08.508 --> 01:15:10.635
Oh, for a while now.

01:15:16.141 --> 01:15:18.852
Women... love me.

01:15:19.018 --> 01:15:20.728
But you know that.

01:15:21.938 --> 01:15:25.775
But for serious,
two things you want to know about me:

01:15:25.942 --> 01:15:29.112
One: I make love with my boots on.

01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:31.489
And two...

01:15:37.036 --> 01:15:38.621
I know I've been mean to you, Jack.

01:15:38.788 --> 01:15:41.291
I can... Oh!
...just be such a shit sometimes.

01:15:41.457 --> 01:15:44.085
Uh... It doesn't really matter.

01:15:44.252 --> 01:15:47.422
It's because on account of my life
sucking the way it does.

01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:50.008
I'm a complete mess, you know.

01:15:51.968 --> 01:15:53.720
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:15:55.221 --> 01:15:59.142
You're probably the only person at
the supermarket I haven't slept with.

01:15:59.309 --> 01:16:01.186
And it's like... you're the only person

01:16:01.352 --> 01:16:03.897
I'm even partially attracted to.

01:16:05.482 --> 01:16:06.774
Thank you.

01:16:08.151 --> 01:16:10.820
That lady is signaling you.

01:16:16.534 --> 01:16:17.827
Oh, I came with her,

01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:20.705
I should find out
what she wants, I think.

01:16:26.252 --> 01:16:28.213
I found out something.

01:16:28.379 --> 01:16:30.840
The Cowboy is meeting
with Scrimshaw early this morning.

01:16:31.007 --> 01:16:33.051
They are picking him up at the hotel.

01:16:33.218 --> 01:16:35.762
They are gonna give him the microchip.

01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:40.558
Cowboy.

01:16:40.725 --> 01:16:42.352
This is Jack.

01:16:42.519 --> 01:16:44.896
- Hey, Cowboy.
- Howdy, big Jack.

01:16:46.564 --> 01:16:48.399
Let's go buffalo gal.

01:16:48.566 --> 01:16:51.736
Let's split this... no right scene.

01:16:51.903 --> 01:16:54.405
He's taking me to the hotel. Follow us.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.829
- Wendy.
- Hi.

01:17:00.995 --> 01:17:03.832
- Uh, I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Call me later?

01:17:03.998 --> 01:17:05.333
Sure.

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:15.426
- Hurry up!
- I am hurrying up, okay?

01:17:15.593 --> 01:17:17.387
I don't want to see her alone
with that sleazy Cowboy

01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:20.348
- any more than you do.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

01:17:20.515 --> 01:17:23.101
I just don't, that's why.

01:17:23.268 --> 01:17:26.437
God, I can't believe how hostile
I feel toward you right now.

01:17:26.604 --> 01:17:29.190
Because I'm stimulating
your adrenal gland, pal.

01:17:29.357 --> 01:17:31.401
Yeah, well, maybe that's
the reason and maybe not.

01:17:31.568 --> 01:17:34.529
Look, you got something to say,
why don't you say it.

01:17:34.696 --> 01:17:36.447
She deserves better. That's all.

01:17:36.614 --> 01:17:38.783
- Better than what?
- Better than you.

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:39.993
Oh! I knew it!

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.495
You think she goes for you,
don't you, pal?

01:17:42.662 --> 01:17:45.290
You know what she sees in you, Jack?
She sees me.

01:17:45.456 --> 01:17:48.459
All right, Pendleton, that's it.
Where are you?

01:17:48.626 --> 01:17:50.670
Where are you, you little weasel?

01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:52.672
Save it for the Cowboy.

01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:01.389
Ah! Wrong door!

01:18:02.932 --> 01:18:05.643
That's an exit, Jack.
Come on, now, control it.

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.770
Come on, you're
a dangerous individual, Jack.

01:18:07.937 --> 01:18:09.814
Come on, you can do it!

01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:12.817
Big Jack!

01:18:12.984 --> 01:18:15.195
Don't knock, just come!

01:18:15.361 --> 01:18:17.155
Duke the son of a bitch!

01:18:19.282 --> 01:18:20.617
Jack?

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.871
- Where were you?
- Next door waiting for you.

01:18:25.038 --> 01:18:27.373
Beauty punch anyway, big Jack.

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:32.295
That's it, now tie that sucker tight.
He's gonna squirm when he wakes up.

01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:36.341
There, now look at the Cowboy.

01:18:36.966 --> 01:18:39.677
Hold it! Hold it right there.

01:18:41.554 --> 01:18:44.474
emulation systems activated.

01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:47.018
Contour analysis, stage one.

01:18:47.185 --> 01:18:49.187
Move over, Picasso. Look at this.

01:18:49.354 --> 01:18:51.523
Grid-mapping ectodermal contours.

01:18:51.689 --> 01:18:53.066
Okay, go to the mirror.

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:55.902
Mirror, oh... What are we gonna do?

01:18:56.069 --> 01:18:57.821
I'm going to attempt
an electronic stimulation

01:18:57.987 --> 01:19:00.156
- of your nerves and muscles.
- What's that mean?

01:19:00.323 --> 01:19:02.742
- I'm gonna alter your face.
- My face?

01:19:02.909 --> 01:19:04.452
Change my face? How do you do that?

01:19:04.619 --> 01:19:06.955
Uh... Eh... It's complicated.

01:19:07.121 --> 01:19:10.542
I don't even understand it myself.
But just... trust me.

01:19:10.708 --> 01:19:12.001
Will it hurt?

01:19:12.168 --> 01:19:14.128
Uh... yeah.

01:19:14.295 --> 01:19:15.797
Well, let's not do it then.

01:19:19.592 --> 01:19:21.344
What are you doing in there?

01:19:24.514 --> 01:19:25.932
Are you okay?

01:19:26.099 --> 01:19:27.267
We're getting there, Jack!

01:19:27.433 --> 01:19:30.770
Hang on.
This might pinch just a little bit.

01:19:38.194 --> 01:19:39.487
Jack?

01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:42.615
Is that a five or a six?

01:19:43.199 --> 01:19:45.285
No, I'm right, it's a five.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.587
What?

01:19:55.753 --> 01:19:57.797
- What did you do to him?
- Who?

01:19:57.964 --> 01:19:59.924
- Jack!
- Jack?

01:20:00.091 --> 01:20:02.594
- I'm Jack.
- No! You get away from me!

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.805
I'm Jack. Listen to my voice. It's me.

01:20:05.972 --> 01:20:07.599
Then who's in the bathroom?

01:20:07.765 --> 01:20:09.559
- He is.
- Who is?

01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:10.935
- Him.
- Who?

01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:12.604
The Cowboy.

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:15.273
Sorry. I know it's hard to understand.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.525
It's hard for me to understand.
But you just have to believe me

01:20:17.692 --> 01:20:19.360
- and... and trust me.
- Jack?

01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:22.864
I can explain it later,
but now is not the time...

01:20:23.031 --> 01:20:25.408
- How did you get Jack's hair?
- I'm not too sure about that one.

01:20:25.575 --> 01:20:26.743
Jack?

01:20:27.952 --> 01:20:29.662
Go see for yourself.

01:20:29.829 --> 01:20:33.124
Yeah, I'll go in and see for myself.
I'm not stupid.

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.555
- Jack?
- Oh, my God.

01:20:50.475 --> 01:20:52.143
How?

01:20:58.691 --> 01:21:01.194
Don't ask, okay?

01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:03.196
Just... just trust me.

01:21:03.363 --> 01:21:06.991
I'll explain everything, I promise,
but not right now.

01:21:08.993 --> 01:21:10.203
All right, I'm going with you.

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:12.163
Don't let her go. It's not safe.

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:14.499
Uh, better not, Lydia.

01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:18.169
Tuck used to say he did the things
that I only write about.

01:21:18.336 --> 01:21:20.839
Now I want to do the things
I only write about.

01:21:21.005 --> 01:21:22.841
Now open your mouth, come on.

01:21:32.684 --> 01:21:35.645
- Men.
- Mr. Scrimshaw is waiting.

01:21:39.023 --> 01:21:41.568
All right, what do you say?

01:21:41.734 --> 01:21:44.154
Never beg. Never beg!

01:22:04.674 --> 01:22:06.676
- Hello, Cowboy.
- Howdy.

01:22:06.843 --> 01:22:09.846
Welcome. Come in. Sit down. Join us.

01:22:10.013 --> 01:22:11.973
My friend, we have been waiting for you.

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.225
- Do you think we're close friends?
- God, I hope not.

01:22:14.392 --> 01:22:16.394
How long has it been, Cowboy?

01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:19.105
- Uh, you tell me.
- Almost six years.

01:22:19.272 --> 01:22:21.441
- Ah.
- Don't you remember?

01:22:21.608 --> 01:22:24.402
Idi Amin's barbecue.

01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:27.530
Oh, yes. How could I forgot? The sauce.

01:22:27.697 --> 01:22:31.242
You haven't forgotten the last time
we saw each other, have you?

01:22:31.409 --> 01:22:34.579
Um... speaking of which,
we seem to have a rather...

01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:37.123
attractive added starter
here this morning.

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:40.084
Yes, my sister.

01:22:40.793 --> 01:22:42.337
In-law.

01:22:42.504 --> 01:22:44.756
Good morning, sister-in-law.

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:46.966
Murnau...

01:22:47.133 --> 01:22:49.427
another place setting, please.

01:22:49.594 --> 01:22:53.056
You know, Cowboy, I don't know what
is, but there's something about you.

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:54.641
Please.

01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:57.477
You have changed, you're different.

01:22:57.644 --> 01:23:00.939
Uh, yes... I've been sick.

01:23:01.105 --> 01:23:03.483
- Good thinking, Jack.
- Have some champagne.

01:23:04.317 --> 01:23:06.486
Please, join me.

01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:10.198
I believe that these are the kind
you like. Cuban?

01:23:10.365 --> 01:23:11.574
Cuban?

01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:14.035
Jack, you're in luck,
Cuban are the best.

01:23:16.454 --> 01:23:18.414
I save this for later.

01:23:22.377 --> 01:23:23.753
Jack!

01:23:24.504 --> 01:23:26.130
Cowboy...

01:23:26.297 --> 01:23:28.758
what happened to your hair?

01:23:28.925 --> 01:23:32.303
Uh... Um... I...

01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:34.305
I had it done.

01:23:34.472 --> 01:23:35.932
Clint Eastwood style.

01:23:36.099 --> 01:23:38.893
You see Outlaw Josey Wales?
What a flick.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.689
So much for the pleasantries.
Now, let's get down to business.

01:23:42.856 --> 01:23:44.190
Dr. Canker.

01:23:44.357 --> 01:23:49.279
Yes, well... Miniaturization works
on a dual-chip system.

01:23:49.445 --> 01:23:51.197
Don't play with your food.

01:23:51.364 --> 01:23:52.866
We have one in our
possession at the moment

01:23:53.032 --> 01:23:56.703
and we'll have the other one...
very soon.

01:23:56.870 --> 01:24:00.456
- Take what they got.
- Fine. I take what your got.

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:03.293
You do understand,

01:24:03.459 --> 01:24:06.171
the first chip only miniaturizes.

01:24:06.337 --> 01:24:09.883
Both are required for re-enlargement.

01:24:10.633 --> 01:24:13.553
Right. We whet their appetites
with what we got.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.305
- Good point, Cowboy.
- Thank you.

01:24:15.472 --> 01:24:17.390
- Good point, Jack.
- Thank you.

01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:20.935
Doctor. The chip, please.

01:24:24.481 --> 01:24:26.941
Easy. Easy.

01:24:27.108 --> 01:24:29.027
There it is.

01:24:30.195 --> 01:24:35.700
Hang on, now, Jack.
Now, I want you to reach out...

01:24:35.867 --> 01:24:37.660
and put it in your pocket.

01:24:38.077 --> 01:24:42.457
Gee, it's so tiny. Who would think?

01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:47.629
Jack, what are you doing?

01:24:47.795 --> 01:24:50.423
Take the chip.
Come on, don't freeze up on me.

01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:57.055
I wonder, miss,
if Cowboy's ever told you

01:24:57.222 --> 01:24:59.057
of his incredible tolerance for pain?

01:24:59.224 --> 01:25:00.350
- His what?
- His what?

01:25:00.517 --> 01:25:03.895
- His what?
- His ability to withstand pain.

01:25:05.271 --> 01:25:07.440
Why, his stoicism is legendary.

01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:10.235
Hiding your light under a bushel,
Cowboy?

01:25:10.401 --> 01:25:11.861
That is so unlike you.

01:25:12.028 --> 01:25:15.073
- If that is who you are.
- Uh-oh.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.201
You mind satisfying my curiosity
on that point?

01:25:18.368 --> 01:25:22.914
In lieu of champagne,
how about some real pain?

01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:24.499
Propane?

01:25:34.509 --> 01:25:36.302
Warning. Adrenalin level overload.

01:25:36.469 --> 01:25:38.555
Jack? You all right, Jack?

01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:43.852
- Igoe?
- No!

01:25:44.018 --> 01:25:46.479
Don't worry, Cowboy,
Dr. Canker here has pioneered

01:25:46.646 --> 01:25:48.273
the field of limb replacement.

01:25:48.439 --> 01:25:50.108
Jack, you're generating too much
electrical energy.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:52.235
I can't hold the balance!

01:25:52.402 --> 01:25:54.028
Stay calm, Jack!

01:25:57.949 --> 01:26:02.245
Cowboy, stop it. Don't do that.
I was just kidding.

01:26:05.748 --> 01:26:07.458
Please, Cowboy, no more.

01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:09.919
It was only a joke.

01:26:14.799 --> 01:26:16.718
I'm begging you. Stop it.

01:26:16.885 --> 01:26:18.344
How you doing, Jack?

01:26:20.472 --> 01:26:22.891
God in heaven, deliver us from Satan.

01:26:30.398 --> 01:26:31.983
Oh...

01:26:32.817 --> 01:26:35.695
It's him. It's Putter.

01:26:37.113 --> 01:26:39.032
Get him!

01:26:45.705 --> 01:26:48.124
Jack! Oh!

01:26:53.254 --> 01:26:54.881
Get out of there!

01:26:55.048 --> 01:26:57.133
Did you swallow it, you stupid animal?

01:26:57.967 --> 01:26:59.969
Give it to me. Give it to me.

01:27:04.933 --> 01:27:07.602
Oh! You've found it.

01:27:11.815 --> 01:27:15.652
Hey, don't kill him.
Lock him up. The girl, too.

01:27:19.823 --> 01:27:21.741
Oh! Ugh!

01:27:23.326 --> 01:27:25.954
Oh, great. Gonna have tetanus now.

01:27:27.247 --> 01:27:31.000
We've got to get out of here.

01:27:36.548 --> 01:27:38.049
Why are you just standing there?
Will you help?

01:27:38.216 --> 01:27:39.926
- No.
- What?

01:27:40.093 --> 01:27:44.055
No! Absolutely not until you tell me
what's going on!

01:27:44.222 --> 01:27:46.558
And I want to know everything, Jack.

01:27:46.829 --> 01:27:48.977
What the hell,
you might as well tell her.

01:27:49.144 --> 01:27:50.603
Really?

01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:52.897
- Yes, really!
- Yes, really.

01:27:54.274 --> 01:27:55.775
Right.

01:27:55.942 --> 01:27:58.903
They're preparing the lab now.
Igoe's already on his way.

01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:00.488
Good.

01:28:03.032 --> 01:28:04.576
I don't think she believes me.

01:28:04.742 --> 01:28:07.203
The way you tell it,
I wouldn't believe you either.

01:28:08.037 --> 01:28:09.455
So...

01:28:11.124 --> 01:28:13.251
You talking to him right now?

01:28:13.418 --> 01:28:14.919
Yeah.

01:28:18.423 --> 01:28:19.799
No.

01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:22.302
No. No.

01:28:22.468 --> 01:28:24.846
No, I don't buy that, Jack.

01:28:25.013 --> 01:28:28.183
Sorry, no, this is getting to be
a little bit too much.

01:28:28.349 --> 01:28:31.769
All right, Jack,
I guess we have to prove it to her.

01:28:31.936 --> 01:28:34.939
Jack, repeat to Lydia
exactly what I say.

01:28:35.106 --> 01:28:36.274
Okay.

01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:38.276
- Lydia...
- Lydia...

01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:43.907
I don't blame you
for walking out on me that morning.

01:28:44.073 --> 01:28:49.829
But it was my heart that was broken,
and not my toe.

01:28:50.788 --> 01:28:51.998
What?

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.084
Tuck?

01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:59.756
It's you.

01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:11.476
Wait, wait, let's just wait a second.

01:29:11.643 --> 01:29:12.977
- Tuck?
- Uh-huh?

01:29:14.813 --> 01:29:16.648
I want a moment alone.

01:29:16.815 --> 01:29:20.109
I want you to shut off your sensors,
no picture and no sound.

01:29:20.276 --> 01:29:24.531
Bad idea, Jack. I can't do that.
What if I can't restore contact?

01:29:24.697 --> 01:29:28.159
Look... I just...
I want one moment alone.

01:29:29.661 --> 01:29:32.121
Alone with Lydia, you mean, huh?

01:29:32.288 --> 01:29:34.332
Look, I think you owe this to me.

01:29:36.209 --> 01:29:39.295
Okay, Jack. Signing off.

01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:51.641
I'm not exactly sure
what I want to say to you.

01:29:53.184 --> 01:29:55.186
I know we haven't known each other...

01:29:56.855 --> 01:29:59.023
very long. Less than a day.

01:30:00.066 --> 01:30:01.401
They're coming.

01:30:02.318 --> 01:30:03.736
So much for words.

01:30:10.201 --> 01:30:13.163
Okay, let's go.

01:30:26.176 --> 01:30:28.011
Jack, come in.

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.723
Jack, do you read me? Come in!

01:30:31.890 --> 01:30:33.349
Jack!

01:30:33.516 --> 01:30:36.728
Damn it, I knew I shouldn't have
shut this thing down.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.732
Jack, where the hell am I?

01:30:46.029 --> 01:30:48.865
Mr. Putter, if you please?

01:30:49.032 --> 01:30:50.909
Hey, hey!

01:30:51.075 --> 01:30:52.911
Put the girl in my office.

01:30:59.792 --> 01:31:02.587
Not to worry, Putter.
We know what we're doing.

01:31:18.937 --> 01:31:21.481
We'll use the chip we have
to miniaturize Mr. Igoe.

01:31:21.648 --> 01:31:23.233
Then inject him into Putter.

01:31:23.399 --> 01:31:26.194
Right. He'll locate the pod,
eliminate its pilot.

01:31:26.361 --> 01:31:28.988
And retrieve the second chip.

01:31:35.245 --> 01:31:37.789
Oxygen reserves at 40%.

01:31:37.956 --> 01:31:39.290
Jack?

01:31:50.927 --> 01:31:52.345
I was getting some gum.

01:31:52.512 --> 01:31:55.807
Sure, after I check for nail files.

01:33:04.209 --> 01:33:05.877
Lydia.

01:33:08.713 --> 01:33:10.423
I'm in Lydia.

01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:24.062
Oh, Lydia! I'm a dad.

01:33:25.647 --> 01:33:29.901
Duane, it's Lydia.
I'm in trouble. I need some help.

01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:31.945
You gotta call the police and tell them

01:33:32.111 --> 01:33:34.948
I'm in a renovated factory
across from Pier 18.

01:33:35.114 --> 01:33:36.199
What's up, Lydia?

01:33:36.366 --> 01:33:39.077
I can't talk now, okay?
But call Vector-Scope

01:33:39.244 --> 01:33:42.413
and tell them I've got Tuck Pendleton
and I'm bringing him in, okay?

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.124
And call Pete Blanchard.
His number's in my Rolodex. Got it?

01:33:45.291 --> 01:33:46.251
Yeah, got it.

01:34:49.814 --> 01:34:52.317
Ready to inject subject.

01:34:52.484 --> 01:34:53.693
Wait a minute.

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.821
Once Igoe's inside Putter
and takes command of their pod,

01:34:56.988 --> 01:34:58.281
how do we get the chip out?

01:34:58.448 --> 01:35:01.951
Mr. Igoe will pilot the pod out,
through a tear duct or a sweat gland.

01:35:02.118 --> 01:35:03.453
Why chance that?

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:06.372
Once he takes over the pod
and gets the chip...

01:35:06.539 --> 01:35:07.665
let's re-enlarge.

01:35:07.832 --> 01:35:11.377
- While it's still in Mr. Putter?
- Why not?

01:35:11.544 --> 01:35:14.547
Have you any idea
the kind of mess that would make?

01:35:14.714 --> 01:35:17.800
Tuck, help me, make me strong.

01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:21.346
Restrain him!

01:35:25.183 --> 01:35:27.185
He's in! Igoe's in.

01:35:30.146 --> 01:35:31.356
Let him go.

01:35:31.523 --> 01:35:34.692
Young lady, you are in over your head.

01:35:38.488 --> 01:35:40.782
Let, him...

01:35:40.949 --> 01:35:41.950
go.

01:35:44.369 --> 01:35:45.662
Ouch.

01:35:46.996 --> 01:35:50.917
- Okay, now what do we do?
- I'll tell you what we'll do.

01:35:51.084 --> 01:35:52.752
Everybody into the miniaturizer.

01:35:52.919 --> 01:35:55.004
Everybody into the miniaturizer!

01:35:55.922 --> 01:35:57.715
The chip.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.061
Come on, you too.

01:36:10.228 --> 01:36:12.272
You haven't heard the last of this.

01:36:12.438 --> 01:36:14.774
- Let's go, Jack. You got the chip?
- I can't reach it.

01:36:14.941 --> 01:36:16.442
- You can't reach it?
- I can't reach the chip.

01:36:17.902 --> 01:36:19.571
Maybe it's one of these, look.

01:36:22.615 --> 01:36:24.701
- Nothing's happening.
- Try the green button.

01:36:24.868 --> 01:36:27.349
Don't worry.
They won't know how to close it.

01:36:27.516 --> 01:36:28.955
Certainly not.

01:36:31.082 --> 01:36:33.543
I'll get you for this Margaret.

01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:36.254
- I hope they're not claustrophobic.
- Come on, Jack, come on.

01:36:36.421 --> 01:36:38.298
- What are these switches?
- I don't know.

01:36:38.464 --> 01:36:41.092
- You should have paid attention!
- I was strapped to a table.

01:36:41.259 --> 01:36:42.635
Press them. Try, try!

01:36:42.802 --> 01:36:45.263
- Nothing works.
- This one.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.310
Oh, my God, cover your eyes.

01:36:55.523 --> 01:36:57.192
Come on, give me the damn chip!

01:36:57.358 --> 01:36:58.943
Ah!

01:37:05.492 --> 01:37:08.244
- Drop it!
- Oh!

01:37:13.666 --> 01:37:15.376
Approaching middle ear.

01:37:15.543 --> 01:37:19.172
Lydia... Please, hear this. Please.

01:37:19.339 --> 01:37:21.424
And understand.

01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:23.593
External amplifier activated.

01:37:32.435 --> 01:37:33.937
- Listen!
- What?

01:37:34.145 --> 01:37:35.605
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

01:37:35.772 --> 01:37:37.148
Music, do you hear that?

01:37:37.315 --> 01:37:39.567
No. Come on.

01:37:42.362 --> 01:37:44.656
- We're in here.
- Who's in there?

01:37:44.823 --> 01:37:47.158
- The green button.
- Dr. Canker?

01:37:47.325 --> 01:37:49.702
Press the green button, you fool. Hurry!

01:37:49.869 --> 01:37:52.705
- He'll never find it.
- The man's a high school graduate.

01:37:52.872 --> 01:37:55.166
The green button, you fool!

01:37:57.710 --> 01:37:59.838
- The police.
- Who called the police?

01:38:00.004 --> 01:38:01.548
Let's get out of here.

01:38:01.714 --> 01:38:03.174
Margaret, look what you've done to us.

01:38:03.341 --> 01:38:07.262
Officer, give me a hand.
I know the Mayor.

01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:11.933
- Hold it!
- You hold it.

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:15.353
- I bet it ain't even loaded.
- Oh, yeah?

01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:21.151
Don't worry. Tuck will give me
the strength of ten men.

01:38:21.317 --> 01:38:22.485
Hear that, Tuck?

01:38:34.539 --> 01:38:35.957
Car keys. Come on.

01:38:36.124 --> 01:38:38.543
It's our song I'm hearing.
I'm hearing our song.

01:38:38.751 --> 01:38:41.880
- What?
- Tuck's in me.

01:38:45.458 --> 01:38:48.094
And he's playing...
He's playing our song!

01:38:48.261 --> 01:38:51.055
What are you talking about?

01:38:51.222 --> 01:38:53.766
- Tuck is inside you?
- Yes!

01:38:53.933 --> 01:38:56.728
But that means I just... Oh, shit!

01:39:02.066 --> 01:39:03.776
Hi, Mr. Killer.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.655
I'm really sorry...

01:39:12.911 --> 01:39:15.121
- Where's my Subzero?
- Oh, just get in the car.

01:39:15.955 --> 01:39:18.833
- Will you give me a leg up?
- Every man for himself.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.919
Get down, get down.

01:39:28.635 --> 01:39:30.345
How did he get in me?

01:39:30.512 --> 01:39:32.263
I have no idea.
He hasn't spoken to me since...

01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.641
- Since when?
- ...since Scrimshaw's cellar.

01:39:34.808 --> 01:39:36.434
Since you kissed me.

01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:38.561
- Kiss me again.
- Huh?

01:39:47.111 --> 01:39:48.738
Jack, can you hear me now? I'm back.

01:39:48.905 --> 01:39:50.240
- He's back!
- Let's go.

01:39:56.704 --> 01:39:58.915
Lydia!

01:39:59.082 --> 01:40:00.792
- How we doing?
- We have the chip.

01:40:00.959 --> 01:40:02.585
- All right!
- We're on our way to Vector-Scope.

01:40:02.752 --> 01:40:03.753
All right!

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.672
But, I think that
someone is in there with you.

01:40:05.839 --> 01:40:08.424
- All... What?
- They put someone inside to get you.

01:40:08.591 --> 01:40:10.677
Inside you? Watch your driving!

01:40:10.844 --> 01:40:14.430
Sorry, at the lab, they put
this guy in. So just be careful.

01:40:14.597 --> 01:40:15.765
Shit!

01:40:17.433 --> 01:40:18.852
Think we'll make it
to Vector-Scope in time?

01:40:19.018 --> 01:40:20.103
Can't you go any faster?

01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:24.274
Look, do you want to drive?
I'm going as fast as I can.

01:40:30.697 --> 01:40:32.782
- Aah!
- Stop this car!

01:40:36.161 --> 01:40:39.164
- I said, stop this car!
- Ow!

01:40:47.964 --> 01:40:50.300
Watch your driving, Jack.
What's going on?

01:40:59.559 --> 01:41:01.644
Get me out of here, Canker.

01:41:03.271 --> 01:41:05.190
- Stupid little feet!
- Ow!

01:41:11.654 --> 01:41:13.364
Foreign object detected,

01:41:13.531 --> 01:41:16.326
approaching through esophageal passage.

01:41:29.214 --> 01:41:31.007
external malignancy detected.

01:41:40.475 --> 01:41:42.018
Ow!

01:41:43.353 --> 01:41:46.105
Oxygen reserves at 20 percent.

01:41:53.404 --> 01:41:55.490
Warning. Pressurization imbalance.

01:41:57.951 --> 01:41:59.744
Turbo thruster one, disabled.

01:42:02.288 --> 01:42:04.165
Oxygen depletion factor, six point...

01:42:04.332 --> 01:42:05.583
Get your little hand away!

01:42:12.382 --> 01:42:15.093
You insignificant little pip squeak,
I'm in charge!

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:17.011
Jack, knock him off your lap!

01:42:23.935 --> 01:42:25.520
I'll kill you!

01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:27.897
All right, you want to play?

01:42:37.115 --> 01:42:39.993
Oxygen reserves at 15 percent.

01:43:07.979 --> 01:43:09.522
- Lydia!
- Pete!

01:43:09.689 --> 01:43:11.649
Come on, get in the car!

01:43:17.655 --> 01:43:19.574
Take a pull on this, pal!

01:43:46.810 --> 01:43:48.186
Are you all right?

01:44:00.156 --> 01:44:01.866
Life support system warning.

01:44:02.033 --> 01:44:03.409
The air tanks.

01:44:08.373 --> 01:44:10.083
No booster left.

01:44:19.592 --> 01:44:21.177
Thrusters inoperative.

01:44:50.039 --> 01:44:52.333
Gastrointestinal acid detected.

01:44:57.964 --> 01:45:01.259
Oxygen reserves at ten percent.

01:45:07.974 --> 01:45:10.226
Jack, are you feeling nervous?

01:45:10.393 --> 01:45:14.022
Actually,
I'm feeling pretty relaxed now.

01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:16.774
I need some stomach acid, Jack,
and I need lots of it.

01:45:16.941 --> 01:45:20.028
Oh, no, no, please. Give me a break.

01:45:20.195 --> 01:45:22.739
Jack I don't want to alarm you,

01:45:22.906 --> 01:45:24.824
but I think I saw something
down here and,

01:45:24.991 --> 01:45:27.410
- well, it's probably benign, but...
- A tumor?

01:45:27.577 --> 01:45:29.454
You saw a tumor? How big?

01:45:29.621 --> 01:45:30.872
Jack, you're asking the wrong guy.

01:45:31.039 --> 01:45:33.625
From my point of view
it's the size of Candlestick Park.

01:45:33.791 --> 01:45:35.919
Great, there goes my ulcer.

01:45:41.466 --> 01:45:44.093
- Acidity level increased.
- That's it, Jack.

01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:46.304
Keep those stomach acids flowing, Jack!

01:45:48.097 --> 01:45:51.935
Okay, pal, here's how I spell relief.

01:46:12.497 --> 01:46:14.123
Jack...

01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:15.667
it worked.

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:20.588
You just digested the bad guy.

01:46:22.841 --> 01:46:25.051
There's a phone, thank God.

01:46:25.218 --> 01:46:27.345
So what? All my pocket change is shrunk.

01:46:27.512 --> 01:46:29.806
Use your credit card, Victor.
You do have one don't you?

01:46:29.973 --> 01:46:32.350
- All big men have credit cards.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:46:32.517 --> 01:46:34.352
And how do we get up there?

01:46:34.519 --> 01:46:36.062
I've got it.

01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:40.400
Cowboy, this is Victor Scrimshaw.
What the hell...

01:46:40.567 --> 01:46:42.986
I don't care what you've been through.

01:46:43.153 --> 01:46:45.363
It couldn't possibly compare
with what I've been through.

01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:47.323
Or what I'm going through.

01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:49.701
Cowboy, listen to me:
we need those chips.

01:46:49.868 --> 01:46:52.453
And we need them now, more than ever.

01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.914
Warning! Oxygen level critical.

01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:58.334
Life support systems inoperative.
Switch to manual.

01:47:14.058 --> 01:47:16.853
Jack? Jack.

01:47:18.104 --> 01:47:21.774
I'm running out of air, Jack.
Hope we're almost there.

01:47:22.901 --> 01:47:24.611
I'm setting a course for the mouth.

01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:36.956
Fire up the boilers!

01:47:37.123 --> 01:47:39.876
Hey, Jack!
Jack, you gotta sneeze for me, pal.

01:47:40.043 --> 01:47:41.794
- Can you do it?
- Sneeze, why?

01:47:41.961 --> 01:47:44.672
Because I don't have enough oxygen
to make it out,

01:47:44.839 --> 01:47:47.258
the human sneeze has been clocked
at over 100 mph.

01:47:47.425 --> 01:47:48.927
Right now I'm inside your lung, buddy

01:47:49.093 --> 01:47:51.221
and my only chance to make it out
is for you to sneeze!

01:47:51.387 --> 01:47:52.764
Okay, how?

01:47:52.931 --> 01:47:55.308
- Where is he?
- He's in my lung.

01:47:55.475 --> 01:47:57.769
- He's in the lung!
- Which lung?

01:47:57.936 --> 01:48:01.314
Think pollen, think ragweed think...

01:48:01.481 --> 01:48:05.235
animal dander, fur balls,
anything! I don't know!

01:48:05.401 --> 01:48:06.528
Hairspray!

01:48:06.694 --> 01:48:08.071
Somebody! Get me some hair spray!

01:48:08.238 --> 01:48:09.989
Hurry! Get me some hair spray!

01:48:10.156 --> 01:48:12.116
Right away! Here, give me that!

01:48:12.283 --> 01:48:13.868
Not mousse! Hair spray!

01:48:14.035 --> 01:48:16.371
Give me that! Give me!

01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:33.179
Bless you, Jack.

01:48:33.346 --> 01:48:35.431
- Mr. Putter.
- No.

01:48:37.142 --> 01:48:39.602
Somebody hand me the ampli-visor. Quick.

01:48:43.982 --> 01:48:45.984
I see it, I see the pod.

01:48:46.151 --> 01:48:48.987
- Tweezers, has somebody got some?
- Tweezers!

01:48:49.154 --> 01:48:50.655
Quickly.

01:48:53.158 --> 01:48:54.284
Come on, quickly.

01:49:06.671 --> 01:49:08.423
Go.

01:49:13.595 --> 01:49:14.846
Activate the re-enlargement process.

01:49:16.014 --> 01:49:17.098
- No!
- No, What?

01:49:17.265 --> 01:49:18.933
- The chip.
- The chip. Who has the chip?

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:20.477
I don't have the chip, do you have it?

01:49:20.643 --> 01:49:22.353
- I've got the chip
- The chip. You've got it?

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.855
I had it...

01:49:24.022 --> 01:49:25.190
Where is it?

01:49:27.025 --> 01:49:29.235
- Chip!
- He's got the chip.

01:49:29.402 --> 01:49:31.070
Go, go!

01:49:31.237 --> 01:49:34.699
There's the chip.
There it is. Go. Go! Go!

01:49:37.118 --> 01:49:38.703
Good!

01:49:44.751 --> 01:49:47.045
We don't have time for this.

01:49:47.212 --> 01:49:48.880
Thanks for telling me.

01:49:49.047 --> 01:49:51.049
PEMS one and two functional.

01:49:52.884 --> 01:49:54.177
What is this?

01:49:54.344 --> 01:49:55.720
"Eat me." "Drink me?"

01:49:55.887 --> 01:49:57.430
It's from The Exorcist.

01:49:57.597 --> 01:50:02.727
No, Alice in Wonderland.
She drank something and became small.

01:50:02.894 --> 01:50:05.230
- Or was it the other way around?
- I don't know.

01:50:05.396 --> 01:50:07.023
- Pick one.
- You pick one.

01:50:10.109 --> 01:50:11.736
Yes! Yes!

01:50:12.362 --> 01:50:15.573
Great. Get us some flashlights. Hurry!

01:50:17.784 --> 01:50:19.994
- Are we okay?
- If it's the right program.

01:50:20.161 --> 01:50:22.705
- Go ahead!
- Activate centrifuge.

01:50:22.872 --> 01:50:25.750
- Centrifuge activated.
- We need some goggles here.

01:50:26.501 --> 01:50:28.419
Activate laser pre-light.

01:50:29.003 --> 01:50:30.922
Laser pre-light activated.

01:50:31.089 --> 01:50:32.799
Initiate MRD sequence.

01:50:33.466 --> 01:50:35.093
MRD sequence initiated.

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:36.719
Five...

01:50:36.886 --> 01:50:40.140
four, three, two...

01:50:40.306 --> 01:50:42.142
one, zero.

01:50:43.518 --> 01:50:44.894
Well?

01:50:45.061 --> 01:50:46.646
Maybe it was "drink me".

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:55.321
Disengage shields.

01:50:55.488 --> 01:50:57.407
Let's get him out of there!

01:51:06.374 --> 01:51:08.042
Prepare for pod access.

01:51:25.477 --> 01:51:28.062
Back up, give him some air!

01:51:32.484 --> 01:51:34.777
I love you, Lydia.

01:51:37.197 --> 01:51:39.240
Why didn't you tell me?

01:52:08.394 --> 01:52:10.939
Welcome home, Lieutenant.

01:52:15.401 --> 01:52:17.570
Like a cigar?

01:52:17.737 --> 01:52:18.905
Cuban?

01:52:19.697 --> 01:52:20.615
Thanks.

01:52:54.482 --> 01:52:57.360
- Congratulations.
- Thanks man, thanks a lot.

01:52:59.988 --> 01:53:02.198
Hey... Thanks for the cruise tickets.

01:53:02.365 --> 01:53:05.076
Oh, it's only
two years savings, no big deal.

01:53:05.243 --> 01:53:06.369
That all?

01:53:13.251 --> 01:53:14.419
Well...

01:53:15.837 --> 01:53:18.173
we sure made a hell of a team,
didn't we?

01:53:27.432 --> 01:53:29.350
Take care, big Jack.

01:53:57.003 --> 01:53:59.714
Nobody even noticed my cufflinks.

01:54:07.138 --> 01:54:09.057
He has the chips on him.

01:54:09.224 --> 01:54:11.768
Good. Close the lid.

01:54:11.935 --> 01:54:14.562
- I can't breathe in here.
- Shut up, Margaret.

01:54:14.729 --> 01:54:18.441
It's true, Jack.
The whole shipment had worms.

01:54:18.608 --> 01:54:22.904
Listen, don't run any red lights.
Okay? Thanks a lot.

01:54:40.004 --> 01:54:41.130
Nice wedding.

01:54:41.798 --> 01:54:43.800
Why don't you stop by the office
next week,

01:54:43.967 --> 01:54:46.010
I got some new tests
I'd like to run on you.

01:54:46.177 --> 01:54:48.680
Jack! Jack.

01:54:48.847 --> 01:54:51.182
Listen, I've been thinking
about something, and...

01:54:51.349 --> 01:54:53.393
Well, I really I think that
we should try dating.

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.062
Not exclusively at first,
at least for me...

01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:58.523
Jack, since you're not
going on the cruise,

01:54:58.690 --> 01:55:01.151
I sure could use you
at the store on Monday.

01:55:02.402 --> 01:55:04.404
That was the Cowboy.

01:55:04.571 --> 01:55:05.905
Who's the Cowboy?

01:55:06.072 --> 01:55:07.824
It's classified.

01:55:10.034 --> 01:55:11.828
Doc, I'm cured.

01:55:13.204 --> 01:55:15.832
Wendy, not a chance.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.919
And Mr. Wormwood, thank you.

01:55:20.086 --> 01:55:21.880
And I quit.

01:55:25.633 --> 01:55:28.011
Jack Putter to the rescue!
