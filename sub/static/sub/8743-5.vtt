20:00.432 --> 20:03.766
Cathain was an ancient Irish war goddess.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.667
But her legends must have
some basis in fact...

20:06.838 --> 20:10.934

and lead them to their rightful glory.

So that's my guy's motive?

20:29.595 --> 20:31.290
Perhaps.

20:31.463 --> 20:35.400
A less devout druid
might summon you...

Excuse me. summon Cathain
with darker purpose...

20:40.806 --> 20:43.070
...say. to steal the <i>Lann.</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:47.812
