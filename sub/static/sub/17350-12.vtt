00:25.700 --> 00:27.900
I am at the meeting place.

00:27.967 --> 00:31.033
Your Mr. Mendocia is not.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.033
Far too risky.
The sale is off.

-You're late.
-(IN COCKNEY ACCENT)
Sorry, mate.

00:52.933 --> 00:55.600
We had to make sure the
coast was clear, didn't we?

00:57.233 --> 00:59.367
(MOCK SOUTH AMERICAN ACCENT)
My friend.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.067
Did you bring the merchandise?

01:03.067 --> 01:06.067
Si.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.900
Did you bring the payment?

01:07.967 --> 01:11.133
But of course.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.067
Now, let us make a deal.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.533
Si.

01:20.233 --> 01:22.733
He bought it. We're in.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.500
Copy that, Lady Penelope.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.467

are you in position?

01:26.533 --> 01:28.367
Affirmative, Colonel Casey.

02:23.067 --> 02:26.067
CASEY: Thanks for lending us
your London agent, Scott.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.733
An undercover sting operation
as delicate as this

02:29.800 --> 02:33.667
couldn't be performed
through normal Global
Defense Force channels.

02:33.733 --> 02:38.233
I must say, I was quite
surprised you agreed to it.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.900
You and me both, Colonel.

02:39.967 --> 02:42.400
International Rescue isn't
usually in the bad guy
business.

02:42.467 --> 02:46.400
But, once Parker heard there
was a role in it for him,
I couldn't stop him.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.267
Let's just call this
an experiment.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.600
And experiments always
make me nervous.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.500
Everything's under
control, Scott.

02:53.567 --> 02:57.667
This operation will run like
clockwork, I guarantee it.

02:57.733 --> 03:00.767
-Thanks, Colonel.

all this waiting around.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.133
Anything to report?

03:05.200 --> 03:08.667
Relax, Scott. I've got
one eye on our guys and
the other on the GDF.

03:08.733 --> 03:13.300
Spying on this operation
without the GDF's knowledge
feels not so great.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.067
Covert ops is my job

03:15.067 --> 03:17.900
and I can do it a lot better
without having to ask the GDF
for permission.

03:17.967 --> 03:22.067
Trust me, I won't let Lady P
and Parker out of my sight.

03:36.267 --> 03:41.667
Forgive me, Mr. Mendocia,
but I do not usually sell
to people I don't know.

03:41.733 --> 03:44.067
Very wise, my friend.

03:44.133 --> 03:47.867
But gold-pressed Lidium
is, how they say,

03:47.933 --> 03:49.900
very persuasive.

03:49.967 --> 03:52.133
Ah! Perbacco.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.067
Is a beautiful, no?

03:55.100 --> 03:57.900
I remember when
I was a young child,

03:57.967 --> 04:00.067
on the streets
of Sao Paulo,

04:00.100 --> 04:03.300
my poor grandmother
would say to me,

04:03.367 --> 04:08.133
"Paco, my darling boy,
come closer.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.633
"I want to tell you
something..."

04:10.700 --> 04:14.267
(CLEARS THROAT) Guv,
shouldn't we take a butchers
at the merchandise?

04:14.333 --> 04:19.567
The merchandise? Oh, yes,

04:19.633 --> 04:21.067
No.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.400
Hold on, Scott.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.300
-Kayo!
-Hold on.

04:28.367 --> 04:32.300
This box contains
the latest discovery

04:32.367 --> 04:36.367
stolen from the labs of
Houseman Industries.

04:36.433 --> 04:42.733
A repulsor magnet ray,
rated at 6.7 teslas.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.500
-Ah.
-It could rip the walls
off this hangar.

04:45.567 --> 04:49.600
(CHUCKLES) Not to mention
that gold tooth from
your mouth.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.200
It's the real deal,
all right, Guv.

04:54.267 --> 04:57.567
GDF COMMANDER:
Package is confirmed. It's the
stolen repulsor, Colonel.

04:57.633 --> 05:00.500
Hold position until the deal
has gone through completely.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.367
I want that magnet
in our hands first.

05:03.433 --> 05:07.067
No-one is to move until
I initiate the "go" command.

-Copy. On your mark.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.467
Crystal.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.700
(GRUNTS)

17:14.667 --> 17:17.200
Hmm. Parker?

17:17.267 --> 17:18.900
Parker? Are you here?

17:18.967 --> 17:20.533
PARKER: Yes, m'lady.

17:22.067 --> 17:26.167
Oh, Parker, you do make things
difficult sometimes.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.300
(SIGHS)

17:29.367 --> 17:33.633
LADY PENELOPE: Really, Parker,
the things I do for you.

17:35.133 --> 17:36.933
(WHIMPERS)

17:37.067 --> 17:39.967
Oh. Ooh.

17:40.067 --> 17:44.367
Whoa! That was
way too close.

17:44.433 --> 17:48.067
Hi. Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
Oh!

17:54.567 --> 17:58.500
My, my, Parker, you have
got yourself in a mess.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.333
Yes, m'lady.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.700
(STRAINS)

18:17.767 --> 18:19.633
(CRIES OUT)

18:35.700 --> 18:37.567
LADY PENELOPE: Oh!

18:37.633 --> 18:40.400
-Thank you, m'lady.
-You're welcome.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.300
Now let's get out of here.

18:43.367 --> 18:48.067
I have escaped with
the gold-pressed Lidium
and the device.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.067
That's quite the deal, no?

18:50.100 --> 18:52.267
We haven't finished
negotiating yet.

18:53.867 --> 18:57.700
(GROANS)
Um... Per favore, please,

18:57.767 --> 18:58.800
um, no violence.

18:58.867 --> 19:02.267
I'm a businessman.
Perhaps we can make a deal?

19:02.333 --> 19:04.467
Hmm. Make me an offer.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.633
Here. Take it.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.167
And the repulsor.

19:08.233 --> 19:12.667
(SIGHS) Si. Okay.
Take that, too.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.200
The repulsor! Where is it?

19:20.267 --> 19:23.067
-Parker, look out!
-Ooh!

19:25.933 --> 19:27.667
(DEVICE WHIRS)

19:31.667 --> 19:33.700
Parker, where did
you get that?

19:33.767 --> 19:38.067
I acquired it from Mr. Banino
without his knowledge.

19:38.100 --> 19:43.933
I always say,
hugs are the answer to
all of life's problems.

19:44.067 --> 19:45.533
Old habits die hard.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.100
Yes, m'lady.

19:47.167 --> 19:50.300
Looks like you're all out of
bargaining chips.

19:50.367 --> 19:53.667
Perhaps I have one more
thing to offer you.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.200
(GASPS) No!

19:55.267 --> 19:58.900
I have made my reputation
by keeping secrets.

19:58.967 --> 20:03.700
And that includes
your uncle, Ms. Kyrano.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.300
Lady Penelope, you've gotta
get out now!

20:09.367 --> 20:11.233
LADY PENELOPE:
We'll be right with you.

20:23.167 --> 20:26.000
KAYO: Bad news, Scott.
Banino got away.

20:26.067 --> 20:29.267
We got Parker
and the worker out.
That's the important thing.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.167
Today was a win for
International Rescue.

20:31.233 --> 20:35.500
And we got the repulsor back,
which makes it a win for
the GDF, too, right, Colonel?

20:35.567 --> 20:38.033
Looks like it's
a win all round.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.033
How about a lovely cup
of tea to celebrate?

20:41.100 --> 20:44.167
Technician, perhaps
your unique skills

20:44.233 --> 20:47.667
could be put to use
at our Arctic facility.

20:47.733 --> 20:49.700
Sounds a bit remote.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.233
Mmm-hmm.

20:51.300 --> 20:55.300
Then again, nothing could
possibly go wrong there.
I'll do it!

20:59.133 --> 21:04.133
Scott, as soon as everyone's
together, there's something
I need to tell you all.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.233
Something I should have
said long ago.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.100
Where to, m'lady?

21:21.167 --> 21:23.100
Home, please, Parker.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.100
Parker, are you
forgetting something?

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
Much better.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.100
Yes, m'lady.
