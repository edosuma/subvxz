00:02.270 --> 00:04.638
* All aboard,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha... *

00:04.672 --> 00:08.309
CHRIS ROCK:
In every city, people have
disasters they need to survive.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.678
In Miami,
they have hurricanes;

00:10.711 --> 00:13.347
in San Francisco,
they have earthquakes;

00:13.381 --> 00:15.583
and in New York,
we had blackouts.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.585
You never knew
when one was going to happen

00:17.618 --> 00:20.588
and you didn't want to be
.on the street when it did.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.235
* Crazy...

00:34.268 --> 00:36.670
WOMAN:
Look out!
* But that's how it goes...

00:38.506 --> 00:40.374
Hey, Chris.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.609
I can't believe this.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.843
There's rioting,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.278
looting.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.779
People are
getting killed.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.381
I know, it's tragic.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.417
Tragic?
It's great.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.818
Stay up.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.292
Oh!

00:58.326 --> 00:59.660
Help, let me in,
there's a blackout.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.295
WOMAN:
Go away, get out of here!

01:01.329 --> 01:03.097
Next to
"We're the Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:03.131 --> 01:04.798
can we have a minute
of your time?",

01:04.832 --> 01:07.168
"Let me in, there's a blackout"
is the only guarantee

01:07.201 --> 01:09.837
somebody will not open a door.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.473
Help!

01:15.509 --> 01:17.211
* I'm goin' off the rails...

01:17.245 --> 01:20.548
Hey.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.183
Don't you move a muscle.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.252
I survived
the blackout outside.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.754
Now I needed to survive
the next worst thing--

01:26.787 --> 01:28.722
a white man inside.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.404
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.325
There's always one white person
left in a black neighborhood

02:04.358 --> 02:05.726
after all the other ones leave.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.595
Maybe he was going
to tell the others

02:07.628 --> 02:08.929
when it was safe to come back.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.664
All right, put
your hands down.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.566
I'm sorry, I wasn't trying
to break into your house.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.702
The door was open; I was just
trying to get off the street.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.905
Don't you know better than
to be outside in a blackout?

02:17.938 --> 02:19.940
You don't remember what
happened here in 1977?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.942
You've been around here
that long?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.611
Lived here all my life.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.179
60 years.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.614
Wow, you're probably
like the last white guy

02:26.647 --> 02:27.848
in the neighborhood.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.284
Probably am.
Did a lot
of white people

02:30.318 --> 02:32.653
used to live around here?
A lot of white people?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.455
It was all white people.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.689
It was a whiteout.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.526
It was great.
The men were polite.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.727
Allow me, madam.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.596
Oh, thank you, sir.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.932
When's the last time
you seen a guy do that?

02:44.965 --> 02:47.835
When's the last time
you saw somebody do that?

02:47.868 --> 02:49.270
You got milk delivered

02:49.303 --> 02:50.871
to your houses?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.573
MR. LEVINE:
Cereal, too.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.974
Somebody would even come by
and drink the milk

02:54.007 --> 02:55.443
out of the bowl
when you were done.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.778
It couldn't have
been all great.

02:57.811 --> 02:58.979
We had crime...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.449
but the criminals
were nice.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.917
Excuse me, sir, but may I
bother you for your wallet?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.454
Why, of course.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.523
Wow.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.525
So when did it
all change?

03:11.559 --> 03:14.628
When Willie Harris
moved in.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.772
After that, I
didn't go out much.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.340
Just wasn't the same.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.008
They replaced the crackers
with crack.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.644
NEWSCASTER :
This is the worst blackout

03:30.678 --> 03:32.580
since 1977.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.249
When asked to describe it,
one New Yorker said,

03:35.283 --> 03:36.784
"It looked black out,"

03:36.817 --> 03:39.353
while another said, "It was
like the opposite of day."

03:39.387 --> 03:40.788
Well, better get home.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.790
All right, well, first turn
your pockets inside out.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.891
You think I stole something?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.959
No, I'm just a
freaky old man

03:45.993 --> 03:48.429
likes to see the
inside of pockets.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.763
Yeah, I think you
stole something.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.632
You've been watching me
the whole time.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.900
With a gun.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.903
Look, I don't know
how Houdini did it

03:55.936 --> 03:58.539
and I don't know
how you do it.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.812
You know, everybody
around here isn't a criminal.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.714
If you talked to more people,
you'd know that.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.717
All I need to know is that you
didn't take any of my stuff.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.586
Now, beat it, and don't tell
nobody you were down here.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.655
Back at home, everybody
was talking except me.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.057
All the lights went out and then
these guys came in Doc's

04:17.090 --> 04:19.693
and Doc said they could loot,
but they were gonna do it

04:19.727 --> 04:22.396
with a bullet in their behind--
and then they left.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.632
It was so cool.
We were coming
from Nessa's

04:24.665 --> 04:26.634
and this crazy guy
just snatched Mom's purse.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.537
That's $56.43 worth
of purse snatching.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.705
Yes, honey,
I'm fine.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.408
Anyway, now I
got to go down

04:34.442 --> 04:36.844
to the DMV
to get my license replaced.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.346
Where were you, Chris?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.348
With the Grand Wizard
of Bed-Stuy.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.517
I was, um...
hiding under a car.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.419
I got this.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.755
TONYA:
Where were you, Daddy?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.357
I was asleep.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.792
You slept through the worst
blackout in ten years?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.093
What's the difference?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.595
I wouldn't have seen it
if I was awake

04:54.628 --> 04:55.929
and I couldn't see it
in my sleep.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.965
Oh, well, since you
got so much sleep,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.767
you go get dinner.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.902
Sit down, kids.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.739
While I was getting over
the blackout,

05:05.773 --> 05:07.475
Greg was trying to stand out.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.742
Hey, Chris
and Greg.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.344
Hey, Maria.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.579
Did you see that?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.514
See what?

05:13.547 --> 05:15.683
Watch this.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.388
Hi, Chris and Greg.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.655
She said hi.
So what?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.056
No, she said, "Hi,
Chris and Greg."

05:23.090 --> 05:24.358
You were nowhere
near me.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.626
I've got no
identity.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.994
I'm sick of it.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.729
I'm not Greg, I'm
Chris and Greg.

05:28.762 --> 05:29.930
I'm just a sidekick.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.865
You're not a sidekick.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.434
That's what Batman told Robin.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.668
Yeah, you're right.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.404
Sidekicks have their
own identities.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.939
Tonto, Hutch,
Watson, Robin, Kato,

05:38.972 --> 05:41.775
Tattoo, Chong,
Poncho, 99, Tubbs.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.578
I don't want to be Chris-and-
Greg for the rest of my life.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.814
Governor Chris-and-Greg
was arrested today

05:46.847 --> 05:49.650
on prostitution
and racketeering charges.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.686
Governor Chris-and-Greg
was elected two years ago

05:52.720 --> 05:54.154
on a law and order platform,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.624
and now
Governor Chris-and-Greg faces

05:56.657 --> 05:58.392
up to three years in prison.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.927
Why is it Chris
and Greg anyways?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.462
Why isn't it
Greg and Chris?

06:01.495 --> 06:03.564
Because it's not your show.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.098
While being a sidekick
was getting old,

06:05.132 --> 06:06.600
my mother was feeling young.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.402
* 'Cause I love you,
square biz! *

06:08.436 --> 06:09.737
What's going on with you?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.405
Translation:
"Have you been drinking?"

06:11.439 --> 06:13.106
Well, before I got
my new driver's license,

06:13.140 --> 06:15.576
I had to get a copy
of my birth certificate.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.910
Come to find out

06:16.944 --> 06:19.079
I am one year younger
than what I thought I was,

06:19.112 --> 06:20.814
so I'm happy.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.150
So how come you're just
finding out how old you are?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.052
Well, that's what I had
to ask my mother.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.920
Are you sure
she's your mother?

06:26.954 --> 06:31.659
'Cause, technically, you were
born a year after she had you.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.794
Yeah, she's
my mother.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.530
Oh, see, she had to get me
into kindergarten early,

06:36.564 --> 06:39.166
so she lied about my age
and forgot to tell me.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.534
Congratulations.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.835
I'm so happy for you.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.070
Thank you, baby.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.738
I'm so young.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.009
* I'm talkin' square biz
to you, baby... *

06:49.042 --> 06:50.944
Come on, come on,
sing it with me, baby.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.813
* Square biz!

06:52.846 --> 06:55.649
Since Mr. Levine did me a favor
when the lights went out,

06:55.683 --> 06:59.620
I thought I'd do him a favor
after they were back on.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.854
What do you want?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.222
Well, I know
you don't get out much,

07:02.255 --> 07:03.924
so I thought
maybe we could take a walk.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.659
I could introduce you
to some of the people.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.761
What are you, a
Good Samaritan?
In Brooklyn,

07:07.795 --> 07:09.597
being nice
only aroused suspicion.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.865
Come on, you can see how some
of the things have changed.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.867
I don't just go out
whenever; I have my routine.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.569
I get my groceries
in the morning,

07:15.603 --> 07:17.571
I get my walk in before
the hooligans come out,

07:17.605 --> 07:19.206
I'm back before the
judge show comes on.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.273
My nap, lunch.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.676
President Bush had
that same routine.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.812
Look, it'll only be
for a little while.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.013
It'll be fun.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.881
All right... fine,

07:27.915 --> 07:29.950
to get you off my back,
we'll do it tomorrow.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.985
You know,
I don't know your name.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.187
Levine, Stan Levine.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.756
I'm Chris.
All right.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.591
Hey, hey, turn your
pockets inside out.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.926
I didn't even come in.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.062
Inside out, Houdini,
you could have my mail.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.903
While I emptied my pockets,

07:49.937 --> 07:53.206
my mother went
to empty my father's pockets.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.575
You going to work
like that?

07:54.608 --> 07:55.776
I'm not going to work.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.010
I'm going shopping.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.245
Shopping?

07:58.278 --> 07:59.947
Julius, all I got
is old lady clothes.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.815
I got to get me some
new, young stuff.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.918
I got to get
some new, young money.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.020
Out on the street,
we took a slow stroll

08:07.054 --> 08:09.056
while I brought Mr. Levine
up to speed.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.858
Used to be an ice cream
stand there.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.626
Oh, that's where
they sell crack now.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.227
DEALER:
This is the good stuff;
gonna cost you more.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.929
All right.
Got it all here?

08:15.963 --> 08:19.099
That's where Jerry
and Becky Rosenthal
got married.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.635
Yeah, that's where Petey
Pete got Tisha-T pregnant.

08:21.669 --> 08:25.038
That's where Jacob Cohen
got shot 30 years ago.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.841
Oh, that's where that guy is
about to get shot right now.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.809
Eat lead!

08:28.842 --> 08:30.277
Okay.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.681
Hey, everybody.
Hey, what's up, Chris?

08:33.714 --> 08:35.248
Man, who's this?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
Oh, this is
Mr. Levine.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.151
Mr. Levine,
this is Kill Moves.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.553
How you doing,
Mr. Levine?
And Monk.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.888
This is great;
you bring me out

08:40.921 --> 08:43.023
of the house to meet
a roomful of shvartzers?

08:43.056 --> 08:47.260
Okay, didn't expect him
to say that.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.200
Mr. Levine learned to talk

08:53.233 --> 08:55.302
before language became
politically correct,

08:55.335 --> 08:57.605
so now he had to deal
with SWA--

08:57.638 --> 08:59.773
shvartzers with attitude.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.643
Hey, man,
watch your mouth.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.011
You can't be
saying that word

09:04.044 --> 09:05.813
unless you want
to get your ass kicked

09:05.846 --> 09:06.980
by a roomful of shvartzers.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.281
Hey, man.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.917
Come on, Doc, why
you saying that, man?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.885
CHRIS:
Hey, what's that
word mean anyway?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.854
It's Yiddish
for "black."

09:13.887 --> 09:15.956
Oh!
Monk, what's wrong with you?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.591
What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.292
Hold on.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.630
Doc Harris?

09:23.296 --> 09:26.299
Hm! Stanley Levine.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.636
Y'all know each other?
Yeah.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.071
This clown stole
my girlfriend.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.906
You used to be a clown?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.141
I didn't steal her.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.743
you lost her.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.844
When you stole her.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.945
Man, Chris,
what you doing

09:37.978 --> 09:39.279
hanging with
this guy anyway?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.814
I got trapped outside
during the blackout

09:40.848 --> 09:42.716
and he let me hide in his
house till it was over.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.251
Did you see my woman in there?

09:44.284 --> 09:45.686
You should check his pockets.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.120
I knew coming here
was a bad idea.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.389
Same words spoken
by every white person

09:49.422 --> 09:52.225
in Bed-Stuy since 1964.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.161
While I dealt
with the crazy old man,

09:54.194 --> 09:56.063
Peaches dealt
with a crazy young woman.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.298
* I got the best, the most,
baby, from coast to coast *

09:58.331 --> 10:01.368
* And I don't wanna boast
'cause I love you, square biz *

10:01.401 --> 10:04.872
* I'm talkin' square biz
to you, baby *

10:04.905 --> 10:07.207
* Square, square biz.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.842
So what you think?

10:08.876 --> 10:10.978
I think a leopard cub
is missing his mommy.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.147
It's a'ight.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.382
A'ight?

10:15.415 --> 10:16.850
I thought you knew
what was going on.

10:16.884 --> 10:17.951
This is what's
happening now.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.987
If you're a leopard.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.689
Who told you that?

10:21.722 --> 10:23.323
This girl I met at the mall
named Kiki.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.092
I mean, we're about
the same age,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
we like the same things,
we have the same interests.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.829
She's 40

10:28.862 --> 10:30.698
and likes to yell
at people, too?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.199
Mm

10:32.232 --> 10:33.734
Twenty-nine.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.002
Twenty!

10:35.035 --> 10:36.670
You have bras
older than that.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.938
Gerald Ford was still president
when you were 29.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.773
When you were 29,

10:39.807 --> 10:42.375
Captain and Tennile
was still at the
top of the charts.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.044
When you was 29,

10:44.077 --> 10:45.746
Generalissimo Francisco Franco
still had a country...

10:45.779 --> 10:48.716
Okay, okay, okay.
...when you was 29.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.684
I'm not 29.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.452
Rochelle, I can't believe
you're gonna hang out

10:52.485 --> 10:53.921
with a girl like that.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.388
Got you all out
in clubs and stuff.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.190
Yeah.
Next thing you know,

10:57.224 --> 10:59.192
You be posing for
"Jet Beauty of the Week."

10:59.226 --> 11:01.028
The special "Slight Tummy"
edition.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.764
Everybody looking at you,
knowing all your business.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.999
Your hobbies and your signs
and stuff.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.835
Peaches, okay, I understand

11:07.868 --> 11:09.770
that you are trying
to look out for me,

11:09.803 --> 11:11.972
but I'm just trying
to have some fun.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.807
You are a married woman.

11:13.841 --> 11:17.210
You ain't got no business
having fun.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.881
Peaches, I don't care
what you say, all right?

11:20.914 --> 11:23.851
Age is just a state of mind.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.788
Okay, well, it's not my fault
you feel old.

11:27.821 --> 11:31.058
Just 'cause you're acting crazy
now, I'm old?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.493
Oh, you know what,
go to the club then. Bye.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.995
Bye.
Spush.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.229
I'm going. Spush.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.965
Spush to you.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.101
Back at school, Greg was doing
more wardrobe changes

11:41.134 --> 11:43.503
than Beyonce in concert.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.005
Janet Jackson?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.940
You're dressed like
Janet Jackson?

11:46.974 --> 11:49.509
Almost as weird as
dressing like Michael.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.444
I'm in control.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.880
You're in a woman suit.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.915
And that wasn't the last time.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.788
While Greg was at
an all-time high,

12:00.821 --> 12:03.423
Mr. Levine hit
an all-time low.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.892
Stan, your
door's open.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.726
Doc, call an ambulance.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.363
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.900
I just got here
and I found him like this.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.302
The last guy
that said that ended up

12:15.335 --> 12:18.806
in a slow-speed Bronco chase
on the way to Mexico.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.344
The only thing scarier than
a man almost dying

12:24.377 --> 12:26.279
is being the one
that almost killed him.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.448
I thought walking and meeting
people would be good for him.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.083
I didn't know
he had a weak heart.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.084
He's old, Chris.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.120
Everything on him is weak.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.287
What were you thinking?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.522
You got him out running around

12:35.555 --> 12:36.957
like he's Carl Lewis
or something.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.992
He forgot
four prescriptions.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.061
He got pills to take
for everything.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.063
From his heart beating
to blinking his eyes.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.333
He's even got a pill to help
him remember to take his pills.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.068
You think he'll be okay?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.369
At this age,

12:49.402 --> 12:52.906
you can get over anything
with a good nap.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.946
While my mother was getting
ready for her night out,

12:58.979 --> 13:01.014
my father was worried
about eating in.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.449
Hi, Peaches.
Hi, Julius.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.951
What is this?

13:03.984 --> 13:05.085
A TV dinner.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.419
It looked
better on TV.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.988
How come you
didn't cook?

13:08.021 --> 13:10.390
Because I needed to get
my outfit together.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.392
She needs to get
her head together.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.061
What's that?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.496
It's what the young people
are wearing these days.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.432
Is this what the young people
are eating these days?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.334
Julius, look, I promise,
before I go out tomorrow

13:21.368 --> 13:22.569
I'll cook for you, okay?

13:22.602 --> 13:23.971
Now, baby, just go.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.506
Bye, Peaches.
Bye, Julius.

13:26.539 --> 13:30.177
Rochelle, I don't like
what's happening to you.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.879
You're dressing like
a teenager, wearing wigs.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.346
You just look
ridiculous.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.085
Nothing is happening
to me, okay?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.287
I'm just going out
to a few clubs with Kiki.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.023
You ever wonder why Kiki
want to hang out with
someone your age?

13:43.056 --> 13:46.860
Don't you start with
that 29 thing again.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.262
Girl, you know what,

13:49.296 --> 13:51.564
you ever have
a fat friend?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.333
A fat friend?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.935
Yeah, girl, you hang out
with her

13:54.968 --> 13:56.436
so everybody else
pay attention to you.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.570
So?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.239
So, you're Kiki's fat friend.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.209
Aw, pick up and fetch,
you know it's true.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.244
Peaches,
you take that back!

14:04.277 --> 14:06.613
Look, Rochelle, you may not
want to accept it,

14:06.646 --> 14:08.448
but you look like
the girl's mother.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.417
I know, you know it
and she know it.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.651
I do not!

14:11.684 --> 14:12.953
All right, fine.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.254
Believe what you want,

14:14.287 --> 14:15.923
but don't say I
didn't tell you so.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.224
That's what I'm
talkin', baby.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.858
* Square biz

14:19.659 --> 14:22.229
* Square biz.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.967
While my mother went out
with a young woman,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.336
Mr. Levine got
a visit from one.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.906
I'm sorry, I think
you've got the wrong room.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.574
That's Stan Levine, right?

14:34.607 --> 14:37.978
Yeah.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.446
Then this is the right room.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.580
Who are you?

14:40.613 --> 14:42.015
I'm Chris.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.450
Chris...?

14:43.483 --> 14:46.253
Oh, you're the one
that almost killed him.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.455
I was just trying to take him
out for a walk.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.457
That almost killed him.
Who are you anyway?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.625
I'm Lisa Levine-- his daughter.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.127
His daughter?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.362
But you're black.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.696
Depends on who you ask.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.698
You're black.
Are you his kid, too?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.067
No.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.501
How about Angelina Jolie's?

15:01.534 --> 15:03.203
I'm sorry.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.438
Look, I was just trying
to get him out of the house.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.107
It's not your fault.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.342
He shouldn't be living
alone at his age, anyway.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.045
Listen, I don't really
know this neighborhood.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.381
You think you can show me
where his apartment is?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.715
I need to pack up his things

15:15.748 --> 15:17.550
so I can take him
back to Vegas.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.152
You're taking him to Las Vegas?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.420
I have to.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.688
I can't be running back here

15:21.721 --> 15:23.690
every time he forgets
to take a pill.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.226
I'm going to put him
in a retirement home.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.527
Hope it's segregated.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.029
I'll be right back.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.563
I got to talk to his doctors.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.102
Hey, kid...

15:35.135 --> 15:37.270
Is she gone?

15:37.304 --> 15:38.605
Yeah. How you feeling?

15:38.638 --> 15:40.407
Like you almost killed me.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.211
Hey, how come you have
a black daughter?

15:44.244 --> 15:48.281
You remember when Doc said
I stole his girlfriend?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.450
Let's just say
it was an inside job.

15:50.483 --> 15:54.587
Okay, can't do the joke
I was thinking.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.190
She wants to take
you to Vegas.
I heard.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.526
Now you see why I don't
come out of the house.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.361
All I did was open my door...

16:01.394 --> 16:04.431
try to save your life,
and you try to kill me.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.466
Now she's trying
to stick me in a home.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.435
Next time you want
to do me a favor,

16:08.468 --> 16:12.272
do me a favor-- don't.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.409
While Mr. Levine
was heading out,

16:16.443 --> 16:18.011
my mother was trying to get in.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.447
Kiki, what's
happening, baby?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.215
:
You.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.717
Ow, ow.
Whoa.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.487
Why don't you wait here while
things clear out a little bit?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.422
Oh, no, no, you don't
understand, I-I'm with her.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.125
Kiki, you didn't tell me
you were bringing your mother.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.293
How you doing, mama?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.494
Come on in.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.795
I am not her mother.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.564
N-No, that's my
friend Rochelle.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.366
Oh, hey, I thought
it was your mother.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.301
Why don't you chill
out here for a minute

16:41.334 --> 16:43.670
and wait here while
things, uh... thin out?

16:43.703 --> 16:47.107
Kiki... Kiki!

16:47.140 --> 16:48.675
You just gonna leave me
out here?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.177
I'll see you inside.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.112
It won't be too long.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.081
Moves!

16:54.114 --> 16:56.549
Hey, my man, my man.
How you doing, Moves?
Good to see you, brother.

16:56.583 --> 17:00.353
It was ladies' night,
not old ladies' night.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.788
While my mother
was left hanging,

17:01.821 --> 17:03.556
Mr. Levine got sent packing.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.525
So you're really sending him
to the old folks' home?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.394
:
I could sell his stuff,

17:07.427 --> 17:08.761
put him on the street,
and buy a car.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.263
What type of car?
A used one.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.299
He doesn't have
that much stuff.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.201
He's lived here his entire life
and you're just gonna move him?

17:14.234 --> 17:15.535
What about his friends?

17:15.568 --> 17:17.604
He doesn't have any.
What about his memories?

17:17.637 --> 17:20.273
He's old; he'll forget 'em.
Would you want somebody
to move you?

17:20.307 --> 17:22.509
If somebody tried
to kill me, yeah.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.211
So that's it?

17:24.244 --> 17:25.745
I got to do what
I got to do.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.215
Maybe I should try to kill her.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.685
He said I looked
like her mother.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.355
You're not old.
Yes, I am.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.257
I got kicked
out of the club.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.593
Technically, they just
didn't let you in.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.861
Oh, yeah, that's right.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.131
I was too old to make it
through the door.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.166
Baby, forget
those young girls.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.101
They wish they
had what you have,

17:48.135 --> 17:49.502
and as long as
I'm your doorman,

17:49.536 --> 17:52.239
you got a
lifelong VIP pass

17:52.272 --> 17:54.674
to a one-woman club.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.778
That is the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.380
Three weeks later,
my mother found

18:00.413 --> 18:02.249
the greeting card
he stole it off of

18:02.282 --> 18:05.152
and refused to talk to him
for the next month.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.787
While my mother was going back
to her old self,

18:07.820 --> 18:09.322
Doc got a taste of his past.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.624
How's your mama?
Not thinking about you.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.826
She's fine.
Fine, not thinking about you.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.528
You look just like her.

18:15.562 --> 18:19.299
And you look like
she ain't thinking about you.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.667
Tell her I said, "Hey."

18:20.700 --> 18:23.436
Will do.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.671
You leaving?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.406
Yeah.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.774
Well, where's your dad?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.343
He's staying.
For real?

18:30.377 --> 18:33.446
We talked about it, and
you were right, Chris.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.348
He's lived here
his whole life.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.451
I'm not going to move him
just to make it easier for me.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.253
He wouldn't go, would he?

18:40.287 --> 18:42.255
No.
DOC:
Hmm.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.690
I'm getting him a day nurse.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.859
Because "night nurse"
is a whole other job.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.828
Don't worry,
we'll keep an eye on him.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.231
Thank you.

18:55.302 --> 19:00.139
Back at school, Greg had
officially lost his mind.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.547
Yes.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.748
Hey, Chris-and-Greg.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.451
Hey.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.553
Whoa.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.388
It happens to you, too.
What does?

19:15.422 --> 19:17.290
They call you Chris-and-Greg
even if I'm not here.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.392
Yeah, that's who we are.
We're Chris and Greg.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.494
Oh, this is great.
I thought I was the only one

19:21.528 --> 19:23.230
who didn't have a personality
of his own,

19:23.263 --> 19:24.331
but you don't either.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.598
Yay!
We both suck!

19:25.632 --> 19:26.933
Sorry, Gerard,

19:26.966 --> 19:29.669
looks like
I won't be needing you anymore.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.840
Gerard?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.978
After his daughter left,

19:39.011 --> 19:40.813
for the first time,
I saw Mr. Levine

19:40.847 --> 19:42.415
out on the streets,

19:42.449 --> 19:43.883
but with everything
that happened,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.952
I figured it was best
to leave him alone

19:45.985 --> 19:49.188
until I didn't have a choice.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.932
Mr. Levine, it's me, Chris,
let me in.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.368
Let me in.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.970
Hey, hey, hey.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.706
Last time I let you in,
I went to the hospital,

20:06.739 --> 20:08.708
almost got shipped to the farm;
you did me a favor--

20:08.741 --> 20:11.578
I saw my daughter,
me and Doc patched it up.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.246
You happy?
Now, beat it.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.448
And with that,
Mr. Levine taught me

20:15.482 --> 20:18.351
everything I needed to know
about white people.

20:19.586 --> 20:23.890
