00:00.208 --> 00:01.424
<i>For fifteen years,</i>

00:01.549 --> 00:05.086
<i>I fantasized about everyone noticing me
as I walked down the hall.</i>

00:05.211 --> 00:07.875
<i>What would I be wearing,
would every guy worship me?</i>

00:08.000 --> 00:10.579
<i>Would I be five inches taller
and have porn tits?</i>

00:10.704 --> 00:12.763
<i>No, that was not my reality.</i>

00:13.260 --> 00:16.328
<i>My moment in the spotlights
sucked some serious ass.</i>

00:16.960 --> 00:19.255
<i>But, like any good horror movie,</i>

00:19.380 --> 00:21.188
<i>my nightmare began at...</i>

00:21.513 --> 00:22.613
<i>summer camp.</i>

00:23.147 --> 00:25.067
<i>It was a lame afternoon dance,</i>

00:25.467 --> 00:26.989
<i>but magic was in the air.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:28.820
<i>The dorks were getting crunk,</i>

00:29.560 --> 00:31.406
<i>and the rest of us
were getting drunk.</i>

00:31.927 --> 00:34.613
<i>And for the first time
since I got my braces off,</i>

00:35.082 --> 00:36.328
<i>I didn't feel...</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:37.454
<i>invisible.</i>

00:48.588 --> 00:50.512
<i>There it was, a signal.</i>

00:51.133 --> 00:53.410
<i>I was hoping he'd do something
more inspired</i>

00:53.535 --> 00:55.110
<i>like sniff his armpits.</i>

00:55.596 --> 00:57.265
<i>Matty had a habit of doing that...</i>

00:57.901 --> 00:58.884
<i>a lot.</i>

00:59.009 --> 01:01.812
<i>Attention to personal hygiene
was one of Matty's</i>

01:01.978 --> 01:03.466
<i>many stellar attributes.</i>

01:03.591 --> 01:05.022
<i>He was perfection.</i>

01:06.473 --> 01:07.526
<i>Unlike me.</i>

01:07.692 --> 01:11.071
<i>I was a hot mass of nerves
cause Matty McKibben wanted me.</i>

01:11.439 --> 01:14.157
<i>A nobody,
to meet him in the utility closet.</i>

01:16.280 --> 01:19.246
<i>This wasn't the inciting incident
of some sappy teen special</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:22.566
<i>about how I got knocked up
on the last day of summer camp.</i>

01:22.838 --> 01:24.456
<i>I knew better than the bare rack.</i>

01:24.834 --> 01:27.620
<i>Our passionate bumping of uglies
was a sign.</i>

01:27.745 --> 01:29.595
<i>This year would be my year.</i>

01:29.720 --> 01:31.821
<i>For once, I wouldn't be overlooked.</i>

01:32.175 --> 01:33.677
<i>Not with Matty at my...</i>
Backdoor!

01:33.843 --> 01:35.193
Sorry, I slipped.

01:36.804 --> 01:38.265
<i>Change was in the air.</i>

01:38.850 --> 01:40.200
<i>I could smell it.</i>

01:40.531 --> 01:42.041
<i>There was change...</i>

01:42.166 --> 01:44.799
- <i>and pine-scented cleanser.</i>
- Am I hurting you?

01:44.924 --> 01:47.710
<i>Somehow, admitting my virgin status
seemed like a buzzkill.</i>

01:47.835 --> 01:48.935
No it's a...

01:49.519 --> 01:51.036
probably just an allergy attack,

01:51.161 --> 01:53.405
I get them all the time,
don't let it stop you.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.573
Right.

02:09.377 --> 02:11.423
Are you bummed, summer's like over.

02:13.619 --> 02:15.919
Any plans for your, last two weeks?

02:16.594 --> 02:17.979
I don't know, probably just...

02:18.381 --> 02:20.057
hang out, watch movies,

02:20.615 --> 02:22.017
swim or something.

02:22.315 --> 02:23.316
Cool.

02:25.930 --> 02:29.399
- Are you going to sophomore orientation?
- Don't we have to.

02:30.419 --> 02:31.610
Right, of course.

02:32.446 --> 02:33.565
What I meant was...

02:33.884 --> 02:35.602
<i>I couldn't help myself.</i>

02:36.155 --> 02:37.757
<i>Matty had cracked my hard candy shell</i>

02:37.882 --> 02:40.304
<i>and I was oozing
with sticky sweet love.</i>

02:40.429 --> 02:42.983
Do you wanna go... together?

02:47.912 --> 02:49.878
You are the shit, J-Town.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.544
<i>So he wasn't a poet.</i>

02:51.886 --> 02:53.324
<i>He was still Matty McKibben.</i>

02:54.138 --> 02:56.036
But, nobody can know that I like you.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.402
<i>And I was still Jenna Hamilton.</i>

03:07.395 --> 03:10.857
La suicide Club prÃ©sente :
1x01 - Pilot

03:12.233 --> 03:13.985
That's ridiculous.

03:14.151 --> 03:15.893
Allison is not a size two...

03:16.578 --> 03:18.782
I saw her at the club,
she was falling

03:18.948 --> 03:21.442
out of her tennis skirt,
and not in a good way.

03:23.236 --> 03:24.785
This came in the mail for you.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.378
Jim is a plastic surgeon.

03:28.503 --> 03:30.315
He would never sleep with her.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.630
My mother always knew
when something was wrong.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.293
Sweetie...

03:35.931 --> 03:36.758
come here.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.303
And promptly aborted
the conversation.

03:41.298 --> 03:43.187
I'm not paying Dominic
to do your hair anymore

03:43.312 --> 03:45.218
if you're not gonna style it.

03:50.889 --> 03:51.690
Seriously.

04:01.763 --> 04:02.784
What do I call

04:03.077 --> 04:04.702
the worst day of my life?

04:09.181 --> 04:10.182
Rubbed...

04:10.708 --> 04:13.951
raw and reeling.

04:18.797 --> 04:19.759
<i>He blew you off?</i>

04:19.925 --> 04:22.262
That's crap ass.
But I totally saw that coming.

04:22.826 --> 04:24.180
And you didn't warn me?

04:24.346 --> 04:26.474
It wasn't like I saw it psychicly
or anything.

04:26.882 --> 04:30.020
Guys like Matty
don't go for girls like us.

04:30.565 --> 04:34.107
<i>So, look at the at the bright side.</i>
At least Matty didn't digitize you,

04:34.273 --> 04:36.025
broadcast to the entire bender

04:36.150 --> 04:39.194
and ditch you at winter formal
to hook up with scary Carrie.

04:39.664 --> 04:41.198
That was hardcore humiliation.

04:41.589 --> 04:43.776
In your scenario, at least,
nothing happened.

04:44.982 --> 04:46.286
At least nothing happened.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.353
Can you imagine how suicidal you'd be

04:48.478 --> 04:50.874
if God forbids
you actually took your shirt off?

04:51.430 --> 04:52.691
I can only imagine.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.546
I scent some sad time at Jenna high
and you have got to snap out of it.

04:56.712 --> 04:59.591
<i>Marching band's having a kegger
at Ricky Schwartz' house tonight.</i>

04:59.757 --> 05:02.594
I need my favorite wing women there
since Ming's bagged out.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.012
Is she grounded again?

05:04.178 --> 05:06.223
She can't get her PSAT score
above 1.20.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.892
Her parents are starting to think
she might not be Chinese.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.727
That's so not cool.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.730
I didn't say it, Ming did.
So will you come?

05:14.520 --> 05:15.745
Not sure, I'll call you.

05:15.870 --> 05:18.726
I'll keep my phone up close
and personal in anticipation.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.570
It's on vibrate.

05:20.736 --> 05:23.823
Now, go sob on your blog
and feel free to quote me.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.422
<i>"Jenna, as you are now,</i>

05:39.588 --> 05:42.050
<i>"you could disappear
and no one would notice."</i>

05:43.040 --> 05:44.135
<i>"A Friend?"</i>

05:44.487 --> 05:46.844
<i>"Below is a list of suggestions
you should take</i>

05:46.969 --> 05:48.765
<i>"into serious consideration."</i>

05:48.931 --> 05:51.101
<i>"Number 1: Stop being such a pussy."</i>

05:52.030 --> 05:54.604
<i>Whoever wrote the letter
didn't pull any punches.</i>

05:55.150 --> 05:56.523
<i>It was the truth.</i>

05:57.332 --> 05:58.808
<i>And the truth hurt.</i>

05:59.275 --> 06:00.318
Dinner in ten!

06:03.668 --> 06:07.024
<i>Sometimes,
being a teenager makes you want to die.</i>

06:09.959 --> 06:11.523
I do look awful.

06:13.776 --> 06:15.673
Aspirin, take me away.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.698
Physically, she's on the road
to recovery, but emotionally,

06:46.864 --> 06:48.545
it's gonna be a long call.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.680
Did she exhibit any warning signs?

06:51.810 --> 06:54.831
Why can't she be like
every other teenager and starve herself?

06:54.997 --> 06:57.175
I can wrap my head
around that but this...

06:57.300 --> 07:00.362
Lacey, this isn't about you,
our daughter is suicidal.

07:00.487 --> 07:03.006
I can't imagine what she was feeling
when she read that letter.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.595
<i>It was just
a dramatic teenage rand.</i>

07:08.761 --> 07:10.680
<i>Not a cry for help.</i>

07:13.435 --> 07:17.271
- Hey, sweetheart.
- It's okay, everything's gonna be okay.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.000
<i>It was a misunderstanding
of epic proportions.</i>

07:21.421 --> 07:22.945
<i>God, I wanted to die.</i>

07:23.070 --> 07:25.695
<i>I mean...
You know what I mean.</i>

07:26.070 --> 07:28.448
<i>When I was initially charting my course
to visibility</i>

07:28.614 --> 07:32.410
<i>I really should have defined
the kind of visibility I wanted.</i>

07:32.576 --> 07:35.075
That girl was in my western safe class
last year.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.332
I had no idea
she was huffing spray paint.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.600
My mom's manicurist's
friend's therapist

07:39.725 --> 07:41.844
was at the hospital
when that girl came in.

07:41.969 --> 07:43.845
I swear,
it was pop rocks and coke.

07:43.970 --> 07:47.175
I hear when they pumped
that girl stomach, they found like...

07:49.577 --> 07:51.211
seven hundred pills.

07:51.860 --> 07:53.212
What kind of pills?

07:53.681 --> 07:55.764
It was auto-erotic asphyxiation.

07:55.889 --> 07:57.143
I love that girl.

07:57.309 --> 08:00.063
<i>For two weeks, I tried to explain
that my accident was just that:</i>

08:00.697 --> 08:01.856
<i>an accident.</i>

08:02.022 --> 08:05.362
<i>The more I denied it, the more
everyone assumed I was in denial.</i>

08:05.985 --> 08:07.785
<i>It was a vicious circle.</i>

08:10.656 --> 08:12.275
Emily has a FUPA.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.662
- So creepy!
- I can't believe that girl showed up.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.165
- Handicapped is a hard look to style.
- She should be in a mental world.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.839
- Why are you shushing me?
- Sorry, Sadie.

08:26.954 --> 08:29.300
Don't loser wants us
to talk about her?

08:29.840 --> 08:33.671
That's why she did it.
It was a pathetic ploy for attention.

08:33.796 --> 08:36.159
- She should go to church.
- Or Thailand.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.573
Only a pedophile would screw her.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.072
Maybe.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.875
Everyone is treating me
like I'm in a bad <i>Lifetime</i> movie.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.024
You can be the one
with Kristen Stewart.

08:47.149 --> 08:48.915
Kristen was date-raped.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.664
You guys know I would never try
to hurt myself, right?

08:54.608 --> 08:55.627
Right?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.704
I'm hitting shuffle on the subject.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.646
Hamlet

09:04.962 --> 09:06.655
is one of the most powerful

09:06.780 --> 09:09.507
and influential pieces of literature
in the English language.

09:09.673 --> 09:12.028
The famous expression:
"To be...

09:12.153 --> 09:13.678
"or not to be."

09:14.160 --> 09:16.248
What do you think Hamlet
is saying there?

09:17.642 --> 09:18.661
Anybody?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.582
Yes, you in the back!

09:23.223 --> 09:24.981
I'm not raising my hand!

09:28.073 --> 09:30.510
Can you take the sign
off my forehead that says fragile?

09:30.635 --> 09:32.899
It's not on your forehead.
It's around your neck.

09:33.024 --> 09:35.450
It's a little big
but maybe you'll grow into it.

09:36.132 --> 09:38.953
Scratch that. We said the same thing
about your nipples.

09:40.689 --> 09:43.063
Just go ahead,
I'm gonna wait up the hurt.

09:43.957 --> 09:45.835
The short bus is leaving.

09:53.730 --> 09:56.990
<i>It was the first time we had seen
each other since my deflowering.</i>

09:59.916 --> 10:02.430
<i>And I had almost forgot
how jacked I looked.</i>

10:03.727 --> 10:05.340
<i>Are you okay?</i>

10:05.896 --> 10:07.550
<i>It was a complicated question.</i>

10:12.033 --> 10:13.385
All right, see you tomorrow.

10:13.510 --> 10:16.390
<i>Jenna Hamilton,
please report to the office.</i>

10:17.533 --> 10:19.160
So nice to meet you.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.485
So, I know Mr. Michaels
was your guidance counselor last year.

10:27.610 --> 10:29.610
But considering your recent...

10:31.380 --> 10:32.257
Accident.

10:32.630 --> 10:35.115
Yes, considering
your recent accident,

10:35.240 --> 10:38.179
he thought we might be
a better fit. You know "girl on girl".

10:39.304 --> 10:41.516
I mean, girl to girl.

10:43.183 --> 10:45.514
Your mom gave me a copy of the letter
that you got.

10:45.639 --> 10:46.813
It wasn't very nice.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.399
Confrontations never are.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.870
That's a nifty turn of phrase.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.070
Nifty to say, not so nifty to get.

10:55.425 --> 10:58.199
So Jenna, how did it make you feel
when wrote that letter.

10:59.272 --> 11:00.076
Crappy.

11:01.210 --> 11:02.615
You should know, I didn't...

11:02.740 --> 11:04.160
I didn't try to kill myself.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.041
I was seriously,
"low threshold for pain"?

11:07.260 --> 11:09.509
I'm not suggesting
that you did anything.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.265
No, not at all.

11:11.390 --> 11:13.590
Just for fun, would you mind
if I looked through your bag?

11:13.913 --> 11:17.051
I wanna make sure we won't have
anymore accidents.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.777
Give me that.

11:19.721 --> 11:24.183
Basically I'm here to ensure that
you have an happy and successful year.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.770
You were planning to ingest these,?

11:28.520 --> 11:29.790
Actually I was...

11:30.478 --> 11:31.777
They're breath mints.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.069
So they are.

11:36.332 --> 11:37.405
You know what?

11:37.787 --> 11:40.840
I'm gonna tell you something.
When I was your age, I had troubles too.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.744
Talk about disasters.

11:44.192 --> 11:46.077
Who am I kidding, I'm still a mess.

11:46.948 --> 11:47.949
So hot.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.175
And, you know what?
That what gives me a unique perspective

11:51.300 --> 11:53.963
to make strong connections
with students like yourself.

11:55.357 --> 11:56.257
Urban Decay.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.681
Fancy.

12:00.590 --> 12:02.055
Do you have any questions?

12:02.221 --> 12:05.915
<i>I had about a thousand.
But not one of them was appropriate.</i>

12:06.040 --> 12:08.436
I think you've covered
just about everything.

12:12.852 --> 12:13.858
My bag.

12:14.378 --> 12:15.777
- Yeah.
- That is yours.

12:16.521 --> 12:17.522
Thank you.

12:22.979 --> 12:24.714
U R GONNA KILL THIS YEAR!

12:28.533 --> 12:30.583
JUST NOT YOURSELF- VALERIE

12:43.725 --> 12:44.972
Recycle, douche bag.

12:51.015 --> 12:53.020
What is the fascination with me?

12:53.554 --> 12:56.693
You had to dance with that. Like a bad
car crash on the side of the road.

12:57.192 --> 12:58.528
Everyone wants a pic.

12:59.027 --> 13:01.280
Next person who stares
is gonna get the Evil Eye.

13:01.446 --> 13:03.825
And "Evil Eye" in your condition
isn't gonna translate it.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.535
Flash your pussy !

13:05.701 --> 13:07.745
Let me get my panties off
and we're all set.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.581
<i>All right,
attention Palos Hills High.</i>

13:10.747 --> 13:12.250
<i>Who's ready to rally?</i>

13:13.020 --> 13:15.628
Perfect timing, my school's spirit
is at an all time high.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.629
<i>I got a really big
football game today</i>

13:17.754 --> 13:20.385
<i>and there's no better way
to get pumped up!</i>

13:20.510 --> 13:24.887
<i>Than with the Wheel of Pep.</i>

13:25.053 --> 13:27.598
<i>We need 2 guys and 2 girls.</i>

13:27.764 --> 13:30.393
<i>Do I see Sadie Saxton
raising her hand?</i>

13:32.102 --> 13:33.081
<i>That's classy.</i>

13:33.206 --> 13:36.107
Looks like "Sadie six ton"
might be hitting seven ton.

13:36.273 --> 13:40.185
- Maybe she eats to fill a void.
- Her only void is in personality.

13:40.310 --> 13:42.697
She's a prima bitcherina
who buys her popularity.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.073
How does a girl,

13:44.239 --> 13:48.110
who can't even jump two feet in the air,
get on the pep squad.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.185
Sorry.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.082
<i>I never appreciated
Sadie's bitchiness but,</i>

13:53.248 --> 13:54.548
<i>I understood it.</i>

13:54.879 --> 13:55.918
<i>She was hungry.</i>

13:56.084 --> 13:58.052
<i>McKibben,
you're not gettin' out of this.</i>

13:58.177 --> 13:59.714
Come on, man.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.447
We don't have to watch this.

14:01.572 --> 14:02.759
I'm fine.
<i>I wasn't.</i>

14:03.530 --> 14:05.553
<i>Despite all my external wounds,</i>

14:05.719 --> 14:08.455
<i>my heart was probably
gonna take the longest to heal.</i>

14:08.580 --> 14:10.195
<i>And I was tired of the pain.</i>

14:10.320 --> 14:11.885
<i>You're playing?
Get up.</i>

14:12.010 --> 14:14.645
<i>All right, so let's just...
We need one more girl, then.</i>

14:15.130 --> 14:17.106
<i>Come on guys, one more girl.</i>

14:17.515 --> 14:18.565
<i>One more...</i>

14:19.448 --> 14:20.526
<i>girl.</i>

14:28.627 --> 14:29.969
Jenna, you're malfunctioning.

14:30.094 --> 14:32.872
Everyone's gonna stare,
I might as well go on stage.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.041
<i>Okay, we have a taker.
Come on down.</i>

14:35.207 --> 14:36.426
I know what I'm doing.

14:36.723 --> 14:39.624
<i>Confession:
I had no idea what I was doing.</i>

14:39.921 --> 14:41.378
<i>But I couldn't look back.</i>

14:41.943 --> 14:42.944
<i>At all.</i>

14:50.307 --> 14:52.141
Personal space, ever heard of it?

14:54.452 --> 14:55.852
Okay. It's Jenna, right?

14:56.657 --> 14:57.970
<i>Okay, Jenna.</i>

14:58.095 --> 15:00.548
<i>Spin that wheel!</i>

15:04.554 --> 15:07.323
<i>We gotta get pumped, we got a big game
tonight against the Warriors.</i>

15:07.489 --> 15:10.324
<i>Let's go, show that football team
your support, let's get pumped.</i>

15:11.435 --> 15:14.247
<i>"Sex exchange" is the name of the game.
Now, here is how it's played.</i>

15:14.413 --> 15:16.810
<i>Our contestants will now pair up
into teams of two.</i>

15:16.935 --> 15:20.211
<i>They'll go behind individual partitions
and change into each other's clothes.</i>

15:20.634 --> 15:22.505
<i>The team that get dressed first
will win!</i>

15:24.254 --> 15:26.045
Should we even... bother?

15:26.170 --> 15:28.261
Hell, yeah!
We're in it to win it.

15:29.992 --> 15:31.595
<i>All right, guys.
All ready?</i>

15:31.720 --> 15:33.015
<i>Set, go!</i>

15:45.296 --> 15:46.279
<i>Hurry!</i>

15:46.445 --> 15:47.321
<i>Hurry!</i>

15:48.989 --> 15:50.700
<i>All right guys, come on,
keep it going!</i>

15:52.075 --> 15:53.400
We're winning!

15:54.745 --> 15:56.847
<i>Come on, let them hear,
let them hear you!</i>

15:58.304 --> 15:59.579
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

16:00.110 --> 16:02.007
<i>All right, we wait for the girls.</i>

16:02.333 --> 16:04.297
Go Sadie, go Sadie!

16:15.056 --> 16:16.642
<i>Okay, we have our winners!</i>

16:31.887 --> 16:33.743
C'mon Jenn, you're an animal!

16:34.619 --> 16:37.997
And you brought a all new meaning
to getting in a guy's pants!

16:38.163 --> 16:40.480
I wonder if I can make
a short out of pants like that.

16:40.605 --> 16:42.845
You totally can,
we can make some serious money.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.643
We'll call the line:
"Jenna by Jenna".

16:45.768 --> 16:46.964
What happened to Sadie?

16:47.586 --> 16:49.675
She couldn't fit
into Matty's clothes.

16:50.730 --> 16:52.916
It was karmic intervention.

16:55.269 --> 16:58.375
I've never been so humiliated.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.953
I hate that freak.

17:00.078 --> 17:02.521
- It was a stupid pep rally.
- Already forgotten.

17:02.687 --> 17:03.606
Are you okay?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.108
No. I'm not okay.

17:07.275 --> 17:09.779
- You picked that game on purpose.
- Cool much?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.906
I just ran the wheel of pep
it could have landed on anything.

17:13.343 --> 17:14.575
Lame cop out.

17:15.286 --> 17:17.577
Okay, well for whatever,

17:18.066 --> 17:19.204
I'm sorry.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.372
Please.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.834
I don't need someone like you
to feel sorry for me.

17:24.569 --> 17:27.415
It's not like I'm gonna kill myself
over it.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.759
It's true when they say
that no good deed goes unpunished.

17:34.872 --> 17:35.805
Hi.

17:42.636 --> 17:43.479
Gotta go.

17:50.977 --> 17:53.795
Don't let her get to you,
Sadie loves to play the victim,

17:53.920 --> 17:55.324
you on the other hand.

17:56.150 --> 17:57.827
You have some serious backbone.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.371
Which is about the only thing
not broken on me.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.248
No you were... you were brave.

18:05.272 --> 18:06.544
We're gonna grab for you?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.046
Yeah, just gimme a minute, Liss.

18:09.212 --> 18:10.631
The bell's gonna ring soon.

18:10.797 --> 18:12.383
Then, just go without me.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.055
So impatient.

18:18.576 --> 18:19.650
Girls.

18:20.576 --> 18:22.435
Listen...
just stay out of trouble Jenna.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.145
See you around.

18:24.897 --> 18:25.898
I will.

18:26.287 --> 18:27.288
You will.

18:28.395 --> 18:29.680
Sort of hard to miss.

18:48.530 --> 18:49.670
- Hey T.
- <i>Okay.</i>

18:49.836 --> 18:51.482
So, Ricky Schwartz just called me

18:51.607 --> 18:54.049
and he wanted to know
if he could give you a sponge bath.

18:54.913 --> 18:55.801
Creepy.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.799
With his tongue.

18:58.674 --> 18:59.472
Awesome.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.099
This year is gonna rule!
That's all!

19:31.920 --> 19:33.425
<i>Things were looking up.</i>

19:34.631 --> 19:35.871
<i>Besides my arm.</i>

20:02.703 --> 20:05.410
<i>Being that girl was my new identity.</i>

20:06.081 --> 20:07.909
<i>But I won't let it define me.</i>

20:08.225 --> 20:10.401
<i>I will define it.</i>

20:11.334 --> 20:13.008
Audrey, chiiz, etig

20:13.133 --> 20:14.914
