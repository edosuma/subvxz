9male narrator)
This briefing is
from File A56-7W,

01:06.388 --> 01:07.548
classified top secret.

01:07.623 --> 01:10.888
Subject is Airwolf,
a Mach 1-plus
attack helicopter

01:10.959 --> 01:13.450
with the most advanced
weapons system
in the air today.

01:13.529 --> 01:16.020
It has been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

01:16.098 --> 01:17.895
by its test pilot,
Stringfellow Hawke.

01:17.966 --> 01:19.627
Hawke has promised
to return Airwolf

01:19.702 --> 01:23.365
only if we can find
his brother St. John,
an MIA in Vietnam.

01:23.439 --> 01:25.270
We suspect that Archangel,
deputy director

01:25.341 --> 01:27.138
of the agency
that built Airwolf,

01:27.209 --> 01:29.677
is secretly helping Hawke
in return for
Hawke's flying Airwolf

01:29.745 --> 01:31.770
on missions of
national concern.

01:31.847 --> 01:34.907
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

01:34.983 --> 01:37.110
and a recluse since
his brother's disappearance.

01:37.186 --> 01:39.120
His only friend
is Dominic Santini,

01:39.188 --> 01:41.713
whose air service is the cover
for their government work.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.226
With Hawke and Santini flying
as a team at speeds
rivaling the fastest jets,

01:45.294 --> 01:46.989
backed by unmatched firepower,

01:47.062 --> 01:49.758
Airwolf is too dangerous
to be left in
unenlightened hands.

01:49.832 --> 01:51.959
Finding it is
your first priority.

02:29.605 --> 02:31.129
[men chattering]

02:48.357 --> 02:52.384
Attention. Attention.
Border violation, Section 6.

02:52.461 --> 02:54.019
Intruder aircraft.

02:54.096 --> 02:57.623
Contact, 030 degrees,
northeast.

02:57.933 --> 02:59.594
Eight miles and closing.

02:59.668 --> 03:02.694
Condition red.
Repeat, condition red.

03:02.838 --> 03:04.669
[alarm sounding]

03:04.973 --> 03:07.305
[men shouting]

04:01.063 --> 04:04.226
This is Bo-Dai.
Set up the gauntlet, kids.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.430
Daddy will be right
back with our guests.

04:17.713 --> 04:19.577
And bad luck to us all.

04:19.648 --> 04:20.637
[laughing]

04:32.127 --> 04:33.526
9pilot)
Chopper at two o'clock!

04:55.183 --> 04:56.480
[guns firing]

04:58.387 --> 05:00.082
Bo-Dai to group.

05:00.155 --> 05:02.715
I'm in the groove
and slamming the door.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.354
Raise the gauntlet.

05:15.170 --> 05:16.899
Five choppers, straight ahead.

05:18.674 --> 05:20.904
[guns firing]

05:39.528 --> 05:41.393
9Reed)
The sucker is
still coming in.

05:41.463 --> 05:43.931
Ready to fire in sequence.
My mark.

05:43.999 --> 05:45.967
No, no.
Cease fire.

05:46.602 --> 05:49.002
This jockey's got guts.
He's mine.

05:49.338 --> 05:51.806
9Vidor)
Stay out of this, kids.
All of you.

05:52.941 --> 05:54.704
Aerial combat, Reed.

05:55.210 --> 05:57.110
Not high-tech slaughter.

06:21.236 --> 06:22.533
[laughing]

06:25.641 --> 06:26.767
I'm hit!

06:27.909 --> 06:29.604
Come on, kid, get out.

06:32.948 --> 06:34.313
Bailing out.

06:39.888 --> 06:41.082
9Vidor)
Come on!

06:43.191 --> 06:44.283
Yeah.

06:46.862 --> 06:50.491
Steadman, Delaney,
get down there
and make sure he's okay.

06:50.632 --> 06:53.760
Bring him back to the base.
We'll wine
and dine him tonight.

06:55.137 --> 06:57.264
He can play POW tomorrow.

07:01.376 --> 07:03.344
[sighing]
Okay, Reed, take over.

07:27.769 --> 07:30.135
[thunder rumbling]

07:30.238 --> 07:33.139
Yesterday, Seko Logana's
North Limbawe Air Force

07:33.208 --> 07:35.642
attempted to knock out
the South's new missile sites.

07:35.711 --> 07:37.542
They're a couple
of antique Corsairs.

07:37.612 --> 07:40.604
The one shortage
the North doesn't have
is guts.

07:40.682 --> 07:43.947
But they'll need more
than guts to eliminate
those missiles.

07:45.087 --> 07:46.782
(Marella)
lnter-range ballistic.

07:46.855 --> 07:49.847
They're not in place yet,
but very soon.

07:51.059 --> 07:53.220
How close to
ready are those silos?

07:53.295 --> 07:57.231
72 hours.
Our reports indicate that
once they are operational,

07:57.599 --> 08:00.534
South Limbawe will use them
to attack the North.

08:00.635 --> 08:02.762
And we can't let that happen.

08:08.577 --> 08:10.374
Gen. Ali Butami.

08:10.445 --> 08:12.345
Soviet-trained and educated.

08:12.614 --> 08:15.708
The real power behind
South Limbawe's president.

08:16.918 --> 08:18.408
Harold Ngomo.

08:18.553 --> 08:20.578
He's your basic
figurehead statesman,

08:20.722 --> 08:22.747
but very popular
with the people.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.524
Former history professor.

08:24.593 --> 08:27.357
A nice guy with
a Hitler calling the shots.

08:28.997 --> 08:31.864
(Marella)
Seko Logana,
North Limbawe's president,

08:31.933 --> 08:33.491
and his wife, Lea.

08:35.003 --> 08:36.129
He's been in contact with--

08:36.203 --> 08:37.568
To tell you the truth, honey,

08:37.639 --> 08:40.972
politics and crisis
are beginning to bore
the hell out of me.

08:41.042 --> 08:44.375
Yeah, Dominic's right.
You're just setting us
up for the big pitch.

08:44.446 --> 08:45.913
(Dominic)
Sure.

08:45.981 --> 08:49.940
The good guys in the North
are on the side of
apple pie and baseball,

08:50.018 --> 08:51.576
and the bad guys
in the South--

08:51.653 --> 08:54.713
Are sipping vodka,
waiting to push all
the wrong buttons.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.655
l haven't asked you
to do anything.

08:56.725 --> 08:59.990
Oh, don't bother,
'cause the answer is no.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.928
l haven't asked
because l didn't think
it would be necessary

09:02.998 --> 09:04.932
once you saw this

09:06.268 --> 09:07.326
photograph.

09:07.402 --> 09:08.630
(Marella)
Taken last week.

09:09.371 --> 09:13.535
The commanding officer
of Gen. Butami's mercenary
Helicopter Corps.

09:13.608 --> 09:16.338
That's Col. Vidor.
Marty Vidor.

09:16.845 --> 09:19.575
(Marella)
Col. Martin James Vidor,
to be precise.

09:19.915 --> 09:22.577
Your commanding officer
in Southeast Asia.

09:22.984 --> 09:25.817
He calls himself
Bo-Dai-Thung nowadays.

09:26.555 --> 09:28.580
Thought he was dead for sure.

09:29.558 --> 09:31.526
He went down in some
heavy ground fire...

09:31.593 --> 09:32.651
Yes, he did.

09:32.727 --> 09:35.287
...in the same
operation as my brother.

09:38.567 --> 09:41.092
lf anybody knows
where St. John is,

09:41.636 --> 09:42.762
he does.

10:02.624 --> 10:04.592
There's not enough
to go around, Delaney.

10:04.659 --> 10:06.456
And l outrank you.

10:06.595 --> 10:08.495
There ain't no rank
in this outfit, Reed.

10:08.563 --> 10:11.396
Yeah? Well,
l'm pulling rank. Come on!

10:29.417 --> 10:31.112
Nice flying yesterday.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.052
(Vidor)
Lighten up, Reed.
lt's a party.

10:36.524 --> 10:38.515
That goes for you,
too, sucker.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.732
Hmm.

10:47.369 --> 10:48.358
[laughing]

10:49.704 --> 10:53.299
Okay, you're right.
l am drunk.

10:54.809 --> 10:56.299
Shot to hell,

10:56.945 --> 10:58.970
but not a drop
of blood showing.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.611
That's not bad, Mamma?

11:03.518 --> 11:05.008
Right. Right.

11:05.086 --> 11:07.611
Maybe l should write
my memoirs, huh, Mamma?

11:07.889 --> 11:10.881
What do you think?
The nine lives of Marty Vidor,

11:11.026 --> 11:12.653
Professional Soldier,

11:13.862 --> 11:15.295
Leader of

11:15.363 --> 11:16.421
[laughs]

11:16.965 --> 11:18.057
Men,

11:19.301 --> 11:20.893
Killer of Brave,

11:23.305 --> 11:24.704
Brave Kids.

11:26.408 --> 11:28.376
lt's high-tech slaughter.

11:30.745 --> 11:35.375
l want pure aerial combat
when l get aced.

11:36.618 --> 11:39.018
Me against somebody
as good as...

11:40.655 --> 11:41.986
[sighs]

11:42.524 --> 11:43.889
as good as me.

11:45.927 --> 11:46.985
Chai?

11:50.498 --> 11:52.022
No tea, Mamma.

11:53.401 --> 11:54.561
Whiskey.

12:04.612 --> 12:05.977
9Vidor)
MiG, 12.:00 high.

12:06.047 --> 12:07.344
9Hawke)
Got him.

12:07.415 --> 12:08.746
That's Bo-Dai's plane.

12:08.817 --> 12:10.114
9Vidor)
All the better.

12:12.220 --> 12:13.687
9Hawke)
I'm on your six.

12:13.755 --> 12:15.780
9Vidor)
Bo-Dai's mine.
Stay out of it.

12:15.857 --> 12:18.257
One-on-one.
That's what it's all about.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.095
Hey, String, what's this
Bo-Dai-Thung business,

12:22.163 --> 12:24.097
the name that
Vidor's calling himself?

12:24.165 --> 12:26.998
Bo-Dai-Thung was
a North Vietnamese flyer.

12:27.335 --> 12:28.859
The colonel shot him down.

12:28.937 --> 12:30.734
The colonel's chopper
against his MiG.

12:31.172 --> 12:32.400
Head-on.

12:32.941 --> 12:34.101
Head-on?

12:34.709 --> 12:35.971
Mamma mia!

12:54.062 --> 12:56.394
[birds chirping]

12:56.464 --> 12:58.659
Another request
from West Germany.

12:58.733 --> 13:02.134
They want to establish
a trade mission
in the capital.

13:02.804 --> 13:03.998
What else do they want?

13:04.072 --> 13:06.700
Agreements on imports,
exports.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.673
That's another name for oil.
Ha!

13:10.011 --> 13:11.740
That makes six contenders.

13:12.113 --> 13:15.947
The Russians, Japanese,
West Germany, the French,

13:16.718 --> 13:19.414
and now, of course,
the Americans.

13:20.121 --> 13:22.646
Oh, it's amazing
how much they can love you

13:22.724 --> 13:24.157
when you have something
they want.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.489
And South Limbawe
wants it most of all.

13:26.561 --> 13:28.256
Speaking of which,

13:28.329 --> 13:32.095
where is this miracle worker
from Archangel? He's late.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.794
lt's a long trip.
He'll be here.

13:34.736 --> 13:35.964
No doubt.

13:36.037 --> 13:39.063
Mercenaries are
very dependable
when money's involved.

13:39.774 --> 13:43.574
Lea, l don't like it.
l don't like it at all.

13:44.012 --> 13:46.913
Using outside forces
for an African problem.

13:47.882 --> 13:51.477
lt makes us no different
than the South
and Butami's white killers.

13:51.553 --> 13:55.148
Yes,
but l don't like the idea
of leaving your guard behind.

13:55.323 --> 13:58.588
Butami has tried to kill you
twice in as many months.

13:58.927 --> 14:00.724
You must understand, my dear.

14:00.795 --> 14:04.663
Less eyes to see,
and less mouths to inform.

14:07.402 --> 14:08.835
[birds chirping]

14:13.975 --> 14:15.602
[helicopter approaching]

14:39.968 --> 14:43.199
And these, of course,
are machine guns, cannons.

14:43.638 --> 14:45.401
But l ask you, Mr. President,

14:45.473 --> 14:48.237
is she a beauty,
or is she a beauty?

14:48.309 --> 14:49.503
[laughing]

14:49.577 --> 14:51.238
And look at those lines.

14:51.346 --> 14:53.541
Yes, Mr. Santini,
it's very aesthetic, l'm sure.

14:53.615 --> 14:55.913
But can the aircraft
do everything you say it can?

14:55.984 --> 14:57.417
Absolutely, sir.

14:58.319 --> 14:59.616
May l ask you, sir?

14:59.687 --> 15:02.554
How much is the Firm
paying you and Mr. Hawke

15:02.624 --> 15:04.717
for helping we poor natives?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.021
We're here because...

15:07.962 --> 15:09.793
Well, it's not costing you.

15:10.331 --> 15:11.593
lsn't it?

15:12.534 --> 15:14.525
So Mr. Hawke is
what you would call

15:14.602 --> 15:16.661
a seat-of-the-pants flyer,
Mr. Santini?

15:18.973 --> 15:21.498
That's right, ma'am.
l--l guess he is.

15:22.844 --> 15:24.812
He's also my best friend.

15:26.047 --> 15:29.380
Then, if nothing else,
Mr. Hawke is a very lucky man.

15:30.818 --> 15:32.080
[laughs]

15:52.040 --> 15:53.803
(Hawke)
She may look big,
Mr. President,

15:53.875 --> 15:57.106
but this lady's actually
very light on her feet,
right, Dom?

15:57.612 --> 16:00.137
Come on, give me a hand.
Right this way, sir.

16:06.287 --> 16:08.653
Right here in
the tail section, please.

16:10.258 --> 16:12.749
(Seko)
ls there something the matter,
Mr. Hawke?

16:13.661 --> 16:16.858
(Hawke)
Yes, sir,
Mr. President. Absolutely.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.227
(Hawke)
Just stay behind the tail,
please.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.927
You folks stay right here.

16:21.002 --> 16:22.663
But, Mr. Hawke, please.
What are you--

16:22.737 --> 16:24.637
Just get ready for
the next demonstration.

16:24.706 --> 16:27.504
(Dominic)
Why don't we stand up
against this tail over here?

16:27.575 --> 16:28.906
There we go.

16:40.088 --> 16:41.578
There you are.

16:41.756 --> 16:44.122
[guns firing]

16:55.637 --> 16:57.901
(Dominic)
Yeah, he's out of range.

16:57.972 --> 16:59.439
We'll never catch him now.

16:59.507 --> 17:01.407
(Hawke)
He's pretty fast on his feet.

17:01.476 --> 17:04.069
Fast on his feet? Of course.

17:04.145 --> 17:05.907
lt must be his natural rhythm.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.709
lnsensitive to pain.

17:11.618 --> 17:14.781
l'll be at Airwolf.
lt's time to get out of here.

17:17.892 --> 17:20.827
Oh, Seko, you may as well
have called him a racist.

17:20.895 --> 17:21.862
(Seko)
l thought l did.

17:21.929 --> 17:24.522
Lea, l say what
l feel when l feel it.

17:24.598 --> 17:26.999
We're here to help you, sir.
You need our--

17:27.068 --> 17:29.298
We don't need
your kind of help.

17:29.370 --> 17:32.737
You're right. None of us need
the wrong type of help.

17:32.807 --> 17:34.832
Mr. Santini. Please.

17:35.476 --> 17:37.137
Now, Mr. Hawke is right.

17:37.211 --> 17:39.975
lt is time for us to leave.
But we'll split up.

17:40.048 --> 17:42.710
Now, Lea, you will go
with Mr. Santini.

17:43.084 --> 17:46.417
l will accompany Mr. Hawke
to the location that
we discussed before,

17:46.487 --> 17:48.955
where both will meet
in a couple of hours.

17:49.057 --> 17:50.547
Seko, kiss me.

17:56.297 --> 17:59.562
Mr. Santini,
take good care of her.

18:00.435 --> 18:02.903
She is Limbawe's only
crown jewels.

18:03.838 --> 18:05.897
Take care of yourself, Seko.

18:06.841 --> 18:09.332
l will let Mr. Hawke
handle that chore.

18:19.287 --> 18:21.084
[beeping]

18:37.605 --> 18:39.630
9Seko)
I apologized, damn it.

18:39.774 --> 18:41.833
9Hawke)
Yes, you did, and I accepted.

18:41.909 --> 18:44.241
Never mind accepting it. Ugh.

18:44.312 --> 18:46.007
Slow down, slow down, please.

18:51.586 --> 18:54.555
You did say you wanted to see
Airwolf do Mach 1.

18:54.622 --> 18:56.817
Yes. I've seen it now.

18:56.891 --> 18:59.883
I've seen it, I've felt it,
and I've had enough of it.

18:59.961 --> 19:01.292
Slow down.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.333
Slowing down.

19:07.902 --> 19:09.164
[beeping]

19:14.041 --> 19:15.167
[sighing]

19:15.576 --> 19:16.975
[laughing]

19:17.612 --> 19:19.705
I'm sorry about that,
Mr. President.

19:19.847 --> 19:21.974
Your apology is accepted.

19:22.884 --> 19:24.112
[exclaims]

19:25.186 --> 19:28.815
So, now that we have put
this aircraft
through its paces,

19:28.890 --> 19:31.518
I think it's best we proceed
to our destination.

19:31.592 --> 19:33.560
It would be a little
embarrassing if my wife

19:33.628 --> 19:35.960
arrived there before we did,
don't you think, huh?

19:36.197 --> 19:38.495
[laughing]

19:41.035 --> 19:43.833
(Ngomo)
For the last three years,
Gen. Butami,

19:43.938 --> 19:46.702
you have dominated
the office of President

19:46.774 --> 19:49.174
with your advice
and your views.

19:49.677 --> 19:52.168
l must take
responsibility for that.

19:52.814 --> 19:57.308
And for the fact
that what President Logana
has accused us of

19:57.385 --> 19:58.682
is true.

19:59.454 --> 20:01.945
l know about
the attack you're planning.

20:02.023 --> 20:04.992
l swore an oath to
protect my country.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.219
l have done nothing
to betray that oath.

20:08.296 --> 20:11.424
The offensive l've arranged
is absolutely foolproof.

20:11.566 --> 20:14.057
How can war be foolproof,

20:14.135 --> 20:16.569
if it takes a fool
to start one, General?

20:16.637 --> 20:20.004
They started this war!
Years ago.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.609
There will be no war.

20:23.678 --> 20:25.612
l will call a special session
of Congress!

20:25.680 --> 20:27.580
There's not enough time, sir.

20:27.648 --> 20:29.548
The attack will take place.

20:30.451 --> 20:32.851
(Butami)
You were very useful
when we needed the missiles.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.287
But now,
if you reveal our plan,

20:36.991 --> 20:38.822
the North will be alerted.

20:38.893 --> 20:39.882
So,

20:40.828 --> 20:44.025
l think it would be best
if you remained here

20:45.533 --> 20:47.364
as our guest.

20:49.737 --> 20:50.999
Now, wait a minute, General--

20:51.072 --> 20:52.198
Sergeant.

20:53.541 --> 20:56.476
No stomach for change,
Colonel?

20:59.814 --> 21:01.782
Where's the officer-for-hire?

21:03.317 --> 21:05.308
Oh, he's still here, General.

21:06.888 --> 21:10.153
And my stomach is
none of your concern.

21:11.292 --> 21:13.192
[birds chirping]

21:17.865 --> 21:21.198
Escort Mr. Ngomo

21:21.936 --> 21:24.996
to the guest quarters.
Stay with him.

21:38.252 --> 21:40.379
You almost helped him,
didn't you?

21:40.688 --> 21:43.122
l know it's only
a small matter, General,

21:43.190 --> 21:45.283
but you could've informed me
that you were about to

21:45.359 --> 21:47.259
overthrow the government.

21:47.495 --> 21:50.987
Yes, well, l was inspired.

21:51.265 --> 21:52.289
Oh.

21:52.366 --> 21:54.561
Opportunity of the moment.

21:55.570 --> 21:59.973
Are you questioning
my authority to be inspired,
Colonel?

22:00.441 --> 22:03.808
l never question anything
that comes from the barrel
of a gun.

22:04.745 --> 22:07.737
Or a bottle, eh, Colonel?

22:12.553 --> 22:15.522
The country needs us
now more than ever.

22:15.990 --> 22:18.049
Don't fail me, Vidor.

22:18.125 --> 22:20.093
Perish the thought, General.

22:24.398 --> 22:26.832
l'm returning to
the missile site.

22:27.101 --> 22:29.365
Your Helicopter Corps
will be at maneuvers?

22:29.437 --> 22:31.064
Yes, as planned.

22:31.472 --> 22:33.372
(Vidor)
We need to get practice
for the boys.

22:33.441 --> 22:35.272
Tomorrow is the big show.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.344
l'll see you soon,
Mr. President.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.538
What?

22:41.182 --> 22:42.171
Oh!

22:43.618 --> 22:44.710
Oh, yes.

22:45.786 --> 22:46.878
By the way,

22:46.954 --> 22:49.787
did l tell you
l managed to talk
our Eastern Bloc friends

22:49.857 --> 22:51.950
into testing
their new nerve gas?

22:52.026 --> 22:55.189
lt's being incorporated
into the missile warheads

22:55.262 --> 22:56.627
even as we speak.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.159
Excellent idea, eh?

22:58.232 --> 22:59.790
Oh, yes. Excellent.

23:00.434 --> 23:03.164
And yet another button
for you to push, eh?

23:03.704 --> 23:04.932
[chuckles]

23:05.573 --> 23:07.905
Very good. l like that.

23:08.075 --> 23:11.010
Yes. lndeed.

23:13.247 --> 23:14.475
lndeed.

23:59.093 --> 24:01.755
This service road
leads directly to the border.

24:01.829 --> 24:03.729
10 miles on the other side
is the base

24:03.798 --> 24:07.063
from which Col. Bo-Dai
and his helicopters
will attack us.

24:07.134 --> 24:09.125
Unless you can stop them.

24:09.437 --> 24:11.200
Well, l'll give it a try.

24:11.639 --> 24:14.199
l think l need
a better guarantee than that.

24:15.076 --> 24:18.239
Mr. President, guarantees
come with washing machines.

24:18.312 --> 24:21.042
Well, yes, l understand,
but l think
l would feel much better

24:21.115 --> 24:23.276
if my own man
was flying Airwolf.

24:24.452 --> 24:26.147
lf you had one that could.

24:26.754 --> 24:28.779
Or if l had my own Airwolf.

24:29.957 --> 24:32.255
l could take it
if l wanted to.

24:33.461 --> 24:35.088
You and who else?

24:43.738 --> 24:45.103
Perhaps them.

25:09.730 --> 25:11.163
Tell them to stop.

25:11.298 --> 25:12.765
And why should l do that?

25:13.601 --> 25:16.092
This is a detonating device.
Electronic.

25:16.170 --> 25:18.331
l press this button,
Airwolf goes up.

25:18.405 --> 25:19.394
[sighs]

25:20.307 --> 25:23.435
Mr. Hawke, these men
are here to guard us

25:23.644 --> 25:26.238
and to protect
your precious Airwolf.

25:30.818 --> 25:31.807
[chuckling]

25:32.753 --> 25:34.277
Your detonator?

25:34.588 --> 25:36.146
[both laughing]

25:41.295 --> 25:43.593
9Dominic)
But I've never
played mercenary.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.691
Just let that
old bad side out, Dom.

25:47.968 --> 25:51.995
What bad side?
I don't have any bad side.
I mean, I'm a nice guy.

25:52.072 --> 25:54.870
Although I do have
kind of a bad temper.

25:54.975 --> 25:56.135
[laughing]

25:56.610 --> 25:58.100
[beeping]

25:58.245 --> 25:59.974
9Dominic)
Vidor's field is just ahead.

26:00.047 --> 26:01.844
But I got something else,
String.

26:01.916 --> 26:03.474
A few miles south.

26:03.684 --> 26:05.948
The sonic sensors
are reacting.

26:06.020 --> 26:07.715
Someone's dropping
heavy ordnance.

26:07.788 --> 26:09.221
9Hawke)
Practice.

26:09.390 --> 26:12.052
The colonel always believed
in staying sharp.

26:12.126 --> 26:13.286
Ha!

26:13.360 --> 26:15.624
And I believe in
staying alive, String.

26:15.696 --> 26:18.529
So don't even think
what I know
you're thinking of.

26:21.135 --> 26:22.397
Oh, hell!

26:41.689 --> 26:43.156
[guns firing]

26:46.694 --> 26:47.956
[guns firing]

26:51.398 --> 26:52.695
9Vidor)
Commander to group.

26:52.766 --> 26:55.132
That was lousy, boys.
Very lousy.

26:55.236 --> 26:56.567
Just one hit.

26:56.637 --> 26:58.969
All right, guys,
let's make another run.

26:59.039 --> 27:01.200
Radar says
they've got a contact.

27:01.275 --> 27:03.072
A jet. Supersonic.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.440
[screeching]

27:14.889 --> 27:16.220
[guns firing]

27:35.142 --> 27:36.541
9Hawke)
Col. Vidor,

27:40.681 --> 27:42.672
we have met the enemy.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.149
And they are us.

27:46.553 --> 27:48.077
Capt. Hawke.

28:07.775 --> 28:09.640
Capt. Hawke reporting

28:10.744 --> 28:13.042
with a little present
for the colonel.

28:14.081 --> 28:17.380
Yeah, l see it.
l just don't believe it.

28:19.186 --> 28:22.155
You're not the type
for this kind of business.

28:23.257 --> 28:24.554
And you are?

28:25.859 --> 28:27.554
l've been working at it.

28:28.395 --> 28:30.522
l know. That's why l'm here.

28:31.832 --> 28:33.766
l want a piece of the action.

28:36.804 --> 28:38.704
Okay. You got it.

28:41.976 --> 28:43.136
Colonel.

28:43.210 --> 28:44.734
lt's good to see you, Hawke.

28:45.913 --> 28:48.143
Boys, this is Capt. Hawke.

28:49.383 --> 28:52.216
[chuckling]
The second best
chopper pilot in the world.

28:52.319 --> 28:53.877
Let's get a drink.

28:57.024 --> 28:58.252
(Vidor)
lce.

29:00.461 --> 29:02.292
Hard to come by down here.

29:03.430 --> 29:04.795
You earn it.

29:05.466 --> 29:06.558
Sometimes.

29:07.668 --> 29:10.728
We definitely
earned our perks in Nam,
didn't we?

29:10.804 --> 29:12.362
That's for sure.

29:15.442 --> 29:16.431
Colonel,

29:18.045 --> 29:20.104
what do you know of St. John?

29:20.881 --> 29:22.212
Wasn't he repatriated?

29:22.349 --> 29:23.680
Still an MlA.

29:24.351 --> 29:25.648
Mmm.

29:26.487 --> 29:29.251
l thought you might
know something.
You went down with him.

29:29.323 --> 29:33.589
l saw his ship go down,
but, uh, then l took that
SAM in the aft rotor

29:34.528 --> 29:36.519
and down l went,
right into the arms of

29:36.663 --> 29:38.688
the, uh, North Vietnamese
People's Army.

29:40.534 --> 29:42.024
(Vidor)
l never saw St. John.

29:45.139 --> 29:46.231
Hey!

29:47.708 --> 29:50.677
Remember the day we brought
old Bo-Dai down, huh?

29:51.645 --> 29:53.306
What do you mean ''we''?

29:53.914 --> 29:55.643
You told us all
to stay out of it.

29:55.783 --> 29:57.546
l was just an observer.

29:57.618 --> 30:00.815
uh-huh, l wish l had
50 observers like you.

30:01.855 --> 30:04.016
(Vidor)
Old Bo-Dai-Thung
could not believe

30:04.091 --> 30:06.184
anyone would go
right at him like that.

30:06.293 --> 30:08.761
Least of all
an imperialistic Yankee.

30:08.929 --> 30:10.191
He paid for it.

30:11.031 --> 30:12.396
Yeah. He did.

30:13.367 --> 30:15.995
l'm glad l could go down
and pick up his helmet,
though.

30:16.070 --> 30:17.628
lt's a good reminder.

30:18.272 --> 30:20.570
How come you never went home?

30:20.641 --> 30:22.268
The squadron was my home.

30:22.342 --> 30:24.469
And America had no war.

30:25.112 --> 30:28.639
Besides,
l kind of liked the idea
of being dead. Starting over.

30:28.849 --> 30:30.248
A new chance.

30:30.317 --> 30:32.911
l came down to
Limbawe during the war.

30:33.687 --> 30:35.621
And l've been here ever since.

30:36.924 --> 30:39.051
lt pays well.

30:39.793 --> 30:42.694
What about you?
For starters,
nothing paid well.

30:45.566 --> 30:46.999
[men chattering]

30:47.067 --> 30:48.762
(Hawke)
What's going on out there?

30:55.008 --> 30:56.270
(Vidor)
Firing squad.

30:57.044 --> 30:59.911
The former President
of this embattled country.

31:00.881 --> 31:02.849
Does that bother you, Captain?

31:05.953 --> 31:08.581
This isn't the good
old US of A, you know.

31:08.655 --> 31:11.419
North and South Limbawe
are emerging countries.

31:12.126 --> 31:14.651
And birth is
never an easy process.

31:16.130 --> 31:18.826
Death is always
a hell of a lot easier.

31:23.137 --> 31:24.536
Well,

31:24.638 --> 31:27.664
answer my question.
Does that, out there,
bother you?

31:31.345 --> 31:32.972
l came for the money.

31:33.147 --> 31:34.478
l don't buy that for a second.

31:34.615 --> 31:35.946
l know you, remember?

31:36.016 --> 31:37.347
And l know you.

31:39.319 --> 31:40.980
There's still time.

31:43.157 --> 31:45.318
Time for what?

31:56.436 --> 31:57.801
[speaking foreign language]

32:02.009 --> 32:04.034
There is no time, Captain.

32:04.611 --> 32:06.044
No time at all.

32:06.580 --> 32:07.604
Now,

32:07.681 --> 32:10.844
you tell me why l should risk
what l've got here for you.

32:10.918 --> 32:12.715
l can score big.
Get out of the business--

32:12.786 --> 32:15.380
Tomorrow is not
gonna be any different
for either of us.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.481
lt's just a matter of
who we're doing it for
and why.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.795
My faith's restored, Colonel.

32:29.203 --> 32:32.832
l should have known
you'd see through these
recruits and take action.

32:32.906 --> 32:35.204
Yeah, we all have
our moments of doubt.

32:35.475 --> 32:39.775
General, why waste
a perfectly good
firing squad on one traitor?

32:41.949 --> 32:43.439
Excellent idea.

32:45.152 --> 32:46.141
Ugh.

32:47.387 --> 32:48.376
[grunting]

32:56.563 --> 32:59.396
l won't miss tomorrow,
up there.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.362
l won't fight you.

33:01.435 --> 33:03.198
Yeah, you will.
You won't have any choice.

33:03.270 --> 33:04.362
Now get out of here.

33:04.438 --> 33:06.372
Take Ngomo with you. Move!

33:12.446 --> 33:14.209
[grunting]

33:20.821 --> 33:23.289
(Hawke)
Get him in that ship.
Get it started.

33:31.231 --> 33:33.461
Dom, go back. Get it started.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.099
[guns firing]

33:35.702 --> 33:37.363
Come on, kid. Get up.

33:44.544 --> 33:45.909
[guns firing]

33:51.184 --> 33:52.446
Okay, Dom. l got it.

33:52.586 --> 33:53.883
You got nothing. You're hit.

33:53.954 --> 33:55.182
l'm okay.

34:20.147 --> 34:24.139
Don't worry, General,
your soldier-for-hire
will take care of everything.

34:25.018 --> 34:27.485
Shame they got the President,
though.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.866
Okay, kiddies.
Nothing changes.

34:43.937 --> 34:47.464
All we gotta do is get that
high-tech slick of Hawke's,

34:47.574 --> 34:52.443
blow it out of the air,
and then Butami
can push his buttons.

34:53.580 --> 34:56.413
And tomorrow
we all get our big,
fat bonuses.

34:56.483 --> 34:58.815
[all laughing]
All right!

34:58.885 --> 35:01.877
l have really
trained you well,
haven't l, Reed?

35:02.689 --> 35:03.951
All of you.

35:06.860 --> 35:08.054
[sighing]

35:12.666 --> 35:14.190
[men laughing]

35:25.245 --> 35:27.406
(Ngomo)
l may have been ignorant
of the intricacies

35:27.481 --> 35:29.005
of political power,

35:29.383 --> 35:31.112
but l was never dishonest.

35:31.485 --> 35:33.612
Politically,
l am opposed to you.

35:34.087 --> 35:37.113
That does not mean
l wish to face you
with a weapon.

35:37.591 --> 35:39.957
(Seko)
Then perhaps
l'm dealing with a coward.

35:40.460 --> 35:42.451
(Ngomo)
lt was not l who was
willing to sacrifice

35:42.529 --> 35:44.224
his wife for peace.

35:44.464 --> 35:46.557
l want no one to die.

35:46.933 --> 35:48.798
Guns do not bring peace.

35:49.503 --> 35:51.198
They bring bigger guns.

35:51.605 --> 35:53.869
Such as your
monster helicopter.

35:54.174 --> 35:55.766
(Seko)
One machine, two men,

35:55.842 --> 35:57.742
against your helicopter force?

35:58.445 --> 36:00.777
l would order them out
of the country immediately,

36:00.847 --> 36:03.145
if l could be sure
they're not needed.

36:03.784 --> 36:04.978
[sniffling]

36:05.519 --> 36:08.079
Welcome back to
the world of the living.

36:08.155 --> 36:09.554
ls the bullet still in there?

36:09.623 --> 36:12.251
No.
Passed through. You're lucky.

36:12.492 --> 36:14.084
How do you feel, eh?

36:15.429 --> 36:17.897
[groaning]
How do l look?

36:17.964 --> 36:22.128
Like you've been shot,
lost a lot of blood,
and have a raging fever.

36:23.603 --> 36:25.764
That's just what l feel like.

36:26.072 --> 36:27.972
(Ngomo)
...people l represent are not.

36:28.575 --> 36:29.872
They would
never accept you...

36:29.943 --> 36:31.672
What's going on in there?

36:31.745 --> 36:33.679
[sighs]
Politics.

36:33.814 --> 36:37.511
lt was quite a shock
when President Ngomo
stepped out of Airwolf.

36:38.452 --> 36:43.116
For the first time
since l've known him,
Seko was at a loss for words.

36:43.190 --> 36:45.420
(Seko)
We have too many differences.

36:45.492 --> 36:46.982
Sounds like he
got his words back.

36:47.060 --> 36:48.527
With a vengeance.

36:48.595 --> 36:50.358
He's a great leader.

36:50.997 --> 36:52.589
Maybe so.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.723
How is he in
the human being department?

36:56.603 --> 37:01.006
l'll tell him
you've regained consciousness
and the use of your tongue.

37:03.910 --> 37:05.241
l'm sorry.

37:08.381 --> 37:09.746
l'm feeling better.

37:09.816 --> 37:11.613
[chuckling]
That's what Seko would say.

37:11.685 --> 37:14.313
And neither one of you
are good liars.

37:15.655 --> 37:18.021
Did my husband
apologize to you?

37:19.359 --> 37:20.348
Yes.

37:20.427 --> 37:24.625
You see? He's a leader
and a human being.

37:29.169 --> 37:30.693
Wanna give me a hand?

37:31.338 --> 37:32.805
[laughing]

37:37.511 --> 37:40.639
[sighing]
l really do feel better.

37:40.714 --> 37:43.444
Well, laughter's supposed
to do that, you know.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.448
And tears?

37:48.822 --> 37:50.050
Yes.

37:51.091 --> 37:52.956
Laughter and tears both.

38:01.935 --> 38:05.393
You and l should
live a long time, Mr. Hawke.

38:06.973 --> 38:09.703
[both laughing]

38:10.477 --> 38:11.944
lt hurts.
What?

38:12.012 --> 38:13.502
[laughing]
l can't laugh.

38:17.050 --> 38:19.416
Glad to see you up
and about, Hawke.

38:20.654 --> 38:21.643
[claps]

38:22.055 --> 38:26.116
President Ngomo has agreed
to form a coalition
government with me.

38:26.693 --> 38:27.819
But we need your help.

38:27.894 --> 38:29.122
(Seko)
Lea, if you don't mind.

38:29.195 --> 38:31.163
Of course not, Seko.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.864
Oh, Seko, it's wonderful.

38:35.936 --> 38:38.837
For the first time,
this country could
really be united.

38:38.905 --> 38:40.998
Ah, my dear,
there's the slight matter

38:41.074 --> 38:42.939
of a war that
must be stopped.

38:43.009 --> 38:44.101
(Hawke)
Sir.

38:44.277 --> 38:46.268
Seko, how long have you
been standing there?

38:46.346 --> 38:48.473
A little too long,
l'm afraid.

38:49.182 --> 38:50.615
But something very
interesting happened.

38:50.984 --> 38:52.178
What's that?

38:52.252 --> 38:53.981
l saw my wife
with another man.

38:54.054 --> 38:55.419
(Seko)
A white man.

38:56.022 --> 38:58.354
But instead of getting angry,

38:58.992 --> 39:01.517
l put myself
inside both your skins.

39:02.662 --> 39:05.096
And l knew then
that as you, Hawke,

39:05.565 --> 39:08.329
l was too much of
a man to betray a friend.

39:09.502 --> 39:11.663
And as you, my dearest love,

39:12.706 --> 39:15.300
l knew that
l love Seko too much.

39:16.209 --> 39:17.904
How's that for ego, huh?

39:18.311 --> 39:19.778
[laughing]

39:21.014 --> 39:22.982
Now, now, now.
now, now.

39:24.117 --> 39:28.679
Remember. We must be heroes,
and stop this war.

39:39.432 --> 39:40.421
Hey.

39:40.934 --> 39:41.866
How you feeling?

39:41.935 --> 39:43.095
l'll live.

39:43.169 --> 39:44.796
That's debatable.

39:45.305 --> 39:48.103
We've got to get
those missiles. Now.

39:48.508 --> 39:51.534
And Vidor?
What're you going to do
about the colonel?

39:54.681 --> 39:55.875
String.

39:56.116 --> 40:00.576
l know he was
your friend before,
but he's gone bad.

40:01.454 --> 40:04.150
All these years doing
these kind of things...

40:04.224 --> 40:05.213
That...

40:05.825 --> 40:08.885
He's sick inside.
l've seen them
like that before,

40:09.029 --> 40:12.055
their guts twisted
like, like barbed wire.

40:12.832 --> 40:15.699
Everyday it twists
a little tighter, and tighter.

40:15.835 --> 40:17.234
[helicopter hovering]

40:17.537 --> 40:19.232
[guns firing]

40:29.049 --> 40:31.074
[guns firing]

40:36.823 --> 40:38.256
That's his gunship.

40:45.732 --> 40:47.097
[guns firing]

40:52.639 --> 40:55.199
Hand-tossed mortars.
lt's an old Nam trick.

40:55.275 --> 40:56.401
[screaming]
Lea!

40:57.877 --> 40:59.504
[gun firing]

41:01.281 --> 41:03.010
[screaming]

41:17.764 --> 41:19.459
l'm hit. Seko.

41:19.532 --> 41:23.628
lt's all right.
lt'll be all right.
lt'll be all right, Lea.

41:23.870 --> 41:26.498
Quick, Lieutenant, a doctor!
Get a doctor.

41:33.012 --> 41:34.502
[beeping]

41:59.339 --> 42:01.136
We're across
the demarcation line.

42:01.207 --> 42:02.970
He's still ahead of us.

42:03.376 --> 42:05.071
9Dominic)
Pretty as you please. Playing.

42:05.211 --> 42:06.906
He wants us to
catch up with him.

42:07.313 --> 42:08.712
And then he'll play
his wild card.

42:08.848 --> 42:10.247
9Hawke)
I know.

42:10.784 --> 42:11.978
9Dominic)
Well?

42:12.051 --> 42:13.211
Well what?

42:15.388 --> 42:16.650
Nothing.

42:17.390 --> 42:19.517
3,000 meters and closing.

42:19.592 --> 42:22.060
9Dominic)
Low hills.
Nothing else on the scope yet.

42:27.467 --> 42:29.401
9Reed)
10 seconds from gauntlet.

42:30.203 --> 42:32.296
And here comes
another sucker.

42:32.672 --> 42:35.368
[sighing]
No, Reed. I'm the sucker.

42:36.509 --> 42:37.999
And so are you.

42:43.650 --> 42:46.551
Bo-Dai to group.
Daddy's in the groove.

42:47.487 --> 42:48.647
Stand by.

42:53.860 --> 42:56.886
He's just about
past those hills,
picking up speed.

42:56.963 --> 42:58.225
Ambush time.

42:58.364 --> 42:59.661
9Dominic)
No doubt about it.

43:01.467 --> 43:04.163
9Vidor)
Raise the gauntlet, kids,
and aim straight.

43:04.237 --> 43:06.205
Daddy's slamming the door.

43:07.473 --> 43:08.701
Gen. Butami.

43:11.444 --> 43:12.638
Butami here.

43:13.179 --> 43:16.273
This is where you get
your money's worth,
sweetheart.

43:16.449 --> 43:17.973
With interest.

43:28.027 --> 43:29.426
There they are.

43:29.495 --> 43:31.019
I have a visual.

43:33.233 --> 43:34.530
[guns firing]

44:47.073 --> 44:50.065
[laughing]
So much for
the button-pushers, Hawke?

44:50.977 --> 44:52.638
Try to set her down, Colonel.

44:52.712 --> 44:56.546
9Vidor)
Nah, it's no use.
It's gone on too long anyway.

44:57.383 --> 45:00.511
Games. All games.

45:01.254 --> 45:03.119
Playing soldier of fortune.

45:04.290 --> 45:07.350
9Vidor)
Playing you. It's crazy.

45:09.362 --> 45:12.889
You wanna know the truth,
Hawke, the crazy,
rotten truth?

45:14.267 --> 45:15.996
I know where St. John is!

45:19.172 --> 45:21.265
[explosion]

45:36.055 --> 45:38.023
Vidor was insane, damn it!

45:38.091 --> 45:40.252
The man didn't know
anything about St. John.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.350
What's your evidence?

45:42.428 --> 45:43.360
Me.

45:43.429 --> 45:44.327
You?

45:44.397 --> 45:47.423
Yes. l'd rather believe
l led you into all this

45:47.500 --> 45:49.263
knowing Vidor had
no information

45:49.335 --> 45:51.235
than to think that
we might have lost a clue

45:51.304 --> 45:54.569
that would finally
and irrevocably get you
off my back.

45:55.541 --> 45:56.735
See you.

45:56.943 --> 45:57.932
Oh!

45:58.978 --> 46:00.377
l almost forgot.

46:00.446 --> 46:03.847
l came here to give you
your unofficial report
on Limbawe.

46:03.916 --> 46:05.975
Oh, just what we need.

46:07.854 --> 46:10.846
The coalition government
is still holding very well.

46:10.923 --> 46:13.187
Especially since
the death of Butami.

46:13.259 --> 46:16.786
Seko and Ngomo
are even friends,
in a manner of speaking.

46:17.563 --> 46:19.155
And Mrs. Logana?

46:20.433 --> 46:24.369
She's, uh, fine.
A national heroine.

46:26.372 --> 46:27.862
She sends her love.

46:34.313 --> 46:35.610
And this.

46:39.986 --> 46:42.682
Well, here's to
Mrs. Lea Logana,

46:45.358 --> 46:46.848
all those who survived,

46:47.927 --> 46:49.326
and those who didn't.
