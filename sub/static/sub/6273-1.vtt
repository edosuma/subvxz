VIRGINIA:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>Masters of Sex...</i>

00:01.469 --> 00:02.968
<i>I simply want to</i>
<i> </i> <i>answer the question:</i>

00:02.970 --> 00:05.037
What happens to
the body during sex?

00:05.039 --> 00:06.138
JANE:  <i>Dr. William Masters.</i>

00:06.140 --> 00:09.541
He's the alpha dog
of coochie medicine.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.142
(LAUGHS)

00:10.144 --> 00:11.744
So are you interested
in the job or not?

00:11.746 --> 00:13.412
How can I help?

00:13.513 --> 00:16.148
<i>You will be participating</i>
<i> </i> <i>in a medical study</i>

00:16.150 --> 00:19.084
<i>that examines</i>
<i>the physiology</i>
<i>of sexual response</i>

00:19.086 --> 00:19.952
during automanipulation.

00:19.954 --> 00:22.488
<i>This study will never be</i>
<i> </i> <i>seen as serious science,</i>

00:22.490 --> 00:25.557
and you will be
labeled a pervert.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.659
DR. MASTERS:  <i>You pretended</i>
<i> </i> <i>to have an orgasm?</i>

00:27.661 --> 00:29.795
Is that a common practice
amongst prostitutes?

00:29.797 --> 00:33.532
It's a common practice
amongst anyone with a twat.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.199
I want my tubes untied.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.168
I'm getting married,
and my fiance
wants lots of kids.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.004
DR. MASTERS:  <i>Your fiance,</i>
<i> </i> <i>the peanut king.</i>
<i> BETTY: </i> <i>Pretzels.</i>

00:39.006 --> 00:40.906
It won't be possible
for you to get pregnant.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.941
ETHAN:  <i>First, I get the</i>
<i> </i> <i>"just friends" speech.</i>

00:42.943 --> 00:44.676
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>she invites me in.</i>

00:44.678 --> 00:46.178
I am going to
marry that woman.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.580
I can't imagine
my life without you.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.516
But you don't
want me, do you, Barton?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.484
Sweetheart,
he's a homosexual.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.320
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm seeing a doctor.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.322
I've run across
a few treatments.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.191
Electroshock.
Jesus, Barton.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.327
The two of us
should undertake the
research ourselves.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.729
Have sex with our patients?

01:03.731 --> 01:04.463
With each other.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.666
We're scientists.
Let's see.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.735
Virginia.
Lillian DePaul.

01:09.737 --> 01:15.074
Whom we were
lucky enough to lure
away from Cornell.

01:15.076 --> 01:15.607
My work is to...

01:15.609 --> 01:17.376
To make pap smears
available to every woman
in the country. I know.

01:17.378 --> 01:20.646
It's the one thing I can
do that will hopefully
make a difference.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.181
I have cancer.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.949
I am so sorry.

01:23.951 --> 01:27.586
I'm going to have
to hand the work off.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.620
He deserves a family.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.189
You don't have
a condition, Libby.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.658
<i>It's Bill.</i>
<i> </i> <i>He's the one</i>
<i> </i> <i>with the problem.</i>

01:32.660 --> 01:33.659
I saw your file.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.995
You're pregnant?
That's not possible.

01:36.997 --> 01:37.362
It is.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.664
DR. MASTERS:
This conversation is over.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.099
That's what your father
always used to say.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.835
Don't even begin
to compare him to me!

01:42.837 --> 01:44.036
I wanted to give you this.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.771
You shouldn't be
selling yourself short.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.607
I wouldn't
sell myself, period.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.309
I quit.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.377
I see you still
need a secretary.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.246
I was wondering
if you invited Virginia
this afternoon,

01:54.248 --> 01:58.150
<i>because she put so much</i>
<i> </i> <i>time into this study,</i>
<i> </i> <i>so much of herself.</i>

01:58.152 --> 02:00.752
What Virginia
does this afternoon,
or any afternoon,

02:00.754 --> 02:02.521
is none of our concern.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.722
When it comes to sex,

02:03.724 --> 02:07.359
women have capabilities
vastly superior to men.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.462
This kind of smut
does not belong
in this hospital.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.064
We'll reconvene
in my office.

02:12.066 --> 02:15.501

02:15.503 --> 02:17.369
You're fired.

02:18.037 --> 02:19.905
Will you marry me?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.107
<i>I finally realized</i>

02:22.109 --> 02:25.711
that there is one thing
I can't live without.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.013
It's you.

you in that presentation,
naked like that...

05:00.434 --> 05:01.166
That was not me!

05:01.168 --> 05:03.335
I can't stop
thinking about you.
And even if it were...

05:03.337 --> 05:04.169
I want to

05:07.041 --> 05:07.839
Dr. Crane,
you should know

05:07.841 --> 05:11.476

you in a very delicate spot.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.277
Oh, come on.

Ugh! Oh!

05:17.483 --> 05:19.484
Nice shot.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.254
I'm just saying you
can't take it personally.

05:22.256 --> 05:24.723
Crane's a nephrologist, okay?
They're all perverts.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.392

05:27.394 --> 05:28.493
Ever since the presentation,

05:28.495 --> 05:30.829
I'm propositioned
a dozen times a day.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.031
Mmm.
I get notes
on my windshield.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.567
Just today,
somebody left a dildo...

05:35.569 --> 05:36.768
A dildo on my desk.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.970
One of the girls
in the bullpen, no doubt.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.339
Jesus.
Women are so vicious.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.874
The financial repercussions
are even worse.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.475
DePaul's salary,

05:43.477 --> 05:46.945
it doesn't even
cover essentials,
forget about extras.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.413
And I have no chance
of getting a raise here

05:48.415 --> 05:51.650
because apparently I now
wear the scarlet letter.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.018
That study.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.822
Honest to God, it's worse
than the mummy's curse.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.491
Hey, what about cal-o-metric?

05:59.493 --> 06:00.292
I don't know Cal.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.995
(CHUCKLES) No, um,
Elise was going stir crazy.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.130
She was tired
of junior league.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.465
She'd had it
with scout mothering.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.301
So she decided to
start selling cal-o-metric.

06:09.303 --> 06:12.537
It's a new diet plan
for housewives.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.107
No, it's easy.
You just follow a script.

06:15.109 --> 06:16.908
A script telling
women they're fat?

06:16.910 --> 06:20.912
A script telling women
like, say, Phyllis here,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.781
from the waist up,
Rita Hayworth.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.184
From the waist
down, Henry VIII.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.652
You'd be able
to tell Phyllis that her

06:27.654 --> 06:29.688
long, lonely Saturday
nights are now over

06:29.690 --> 06:31.256
because you've
got something

06:31.258 --> 06:35.127
that can make her
ass match her face.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.829
Don't listen to me.
Ask Elise.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.798
She lost
all of her baby weight.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.532
She had a ton of energy.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.900
Plus she even made
enough money to buy herself

06:41.902 --> 06:44.403
a whole new wardrobe
that included French lingerie.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.939
Your wife still
cares about you enough
to buy French lingerie?

06:47.941 --> 06:51.143
My wife
deserves a medal
for her forgiving heart.

06:51.145 --> 06:54.579
And my wandering ways
are a thing of the past.

06:54.747 --> 06:59.818
Well, how much,
uh, French lingerie
was she able to buy?

06:59.820 --> 07:02.354
An extra 100 bucks
a month worth.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.090
Listen to me, Virginia.
Leave the mummy's
curse behind.

07:05.092 --> 07:09.428
Because when Lord Carnarvon
opened Tutankhamun's
tomb back...

07:09.430 --> 07:13.832
Whenever the hell that was,
four months later, he died
from a mosquito bite.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.834
And what did it say
above that tomb?

07:15.836 --> 07:17.469
"Death shall come
on swift wings

07:17.471 --> 07:20.739
"to him who disturbs
the peace of the king."

07:21.607 --> 07:22.674
Well...

07:22.676 --> 07:26.511

have a tomb or a king.

20% to 50%.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.712

you don't make

these pills even work?

10:24.157 --> 10:28.326

I weighed in at 98 pounds.

do much better

is the answer, Barton.

is unpredictable.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.870
It can have
permanent side effects.

it cures homosexuality.

I'm something else.

27:31.150 --> 27:35.185
I'm not.
Then look at me.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.788
Look at me.

27:39.791 --> 27:40.924
Margaret, I'm trying.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.860
You have to
let me try my way.

a shred of me left that

I won't let you.

I can do this.

I can and I will.

28:10.922 --> 28:14.258
Just...touch me again.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.993
Touch me now.

Damn it!

If you don't help me,
we have nothing.
Don't you understand?

28:23.302 --> 28:25.736
We can do this.
We can make it work!

28:25.738 --> 28:27.771
We just have to try harder.

28:43.789 --> 28:46.457
And California's
so far away.

28:46.459 --> 28:49.893
But I've always
wanted to be in pictures.

28:49.895 --> 28:50.894
You know that, Virginia.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.130
Pictures where you can
actually see my face.

as a production assistant
is for a real studio,

28:56.202 --> 28:57.935
which means he's
gonna be a director soon

28:57.937 --> 29:02.806

be the leading lady
in his first film.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.242
Why shouldn't I
follow my dream?

29:05.244 --> 29:06.844
Of course you should.

29:06.846 --> 29:07.678

come with us.

Sing?

29:11.784 --> 29:14.118

29:14.120 --> 29:15.219
There's nothing
ridiculous about it.

you have here?

to the local butterballs.

29:39.478 --> 29:40.744
Virginia, I know you.

29:40.746 --> 29:43.914
I really don't think
that's your work.

29:44.115 --> 29:48.619
What would make me
really sad is if you're
staying here for the study

29:48.621 --> 29:51.054
because I know Dr. Masters
put your name on it,

29:51.056 --> 29:53.257

Ethan's proposal.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.670
He called me, yes.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.505
And, yes, his heart
is broken in two.

30:08.507 --> 30:12.276
But if you changed your mind,
he would take you back.

30:12.278 --> 30:15.646
And what
Ethan's offering you
is something real.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.649
Whereas Dr. Masters' study...

30:19.117 --> 30:21.018
It's not real.

Not anymore.

here in the hospital?

Those are diet pills.

often combined
with sugar paste or talc.

they're often

a medicine cabinet.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.021
What is that
supposed to mean?

what is going on?

in illicit drugs.

to supplement my income,

is not enough to
support my family.

No, the Pope!

38:05.183 --> 38:07.484

out here to fend me off?

No. No, he didn't.

38:54.700 --> 38:59.235

You've done our

39:12.383 --> 39:14.417
(BABY CRYING)
My feelings exactly, Doug.

39:14.419 --> 39:20.123
And I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't get to speak
to you more last night.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.725
Um...

39:21.727 --> 39:23.960
Yes. Yes, I said
the same to Libby.

39:23.962 --> 39:27.831
Uh, uh,
through his wife, Betty.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.633
We do know most everyone...

39:30.635 --> 39:34.037
Through their
wives, pudendum.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.306
Yes, more than their
husbands see, yes.

39:36.308 --> 39:41.911
Uh, look, I...
How about if I swing
by this afternoon?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.480
Good.

39:43.647 --> 39:45.715
I'll look forward
to it, Doug.

You don't knock?

41:36.427 --> 41:39.062
Libby called.
She asked me to
check and see

41:39.064 --> 41:41.698
how you were doing
with the baby.

41:43.167 --> 41:48.137
Well, from
the look of it,
about as well as you did...

41:48.906 --> 41:50.974
Back in the day.

41:53.611 --> 41:56.913
Son, we have to
find another way.

41:57.648 --> 41:59.282
Somehow,
we do, because...

41:59.284 --> 42:00.517
We're family?

42:00.519 --> 42:03.453
Well, a family's
what you make of it.

42:03.455 --> 42:05.188
Billy, what you're
making is...

42:05.190 --> 42:06.723
Intolerable to you,
I know.

42:06.725 --> 42:07.524
You made that clear.

42:07.526 --> 42:10.927
You made it very
clear that you don't
approve of my behavior.

42:10.929 --> 42:15.832
Honey, all I'm saying
is that every baby cries.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.434
And parents,
well, sometimes, when...

42:18.436 --> 42:20.603
When their nerves
are just shot

42:20.605 --> 42:22.672
and they can't bear
another minute...

42:22.674 --> 42:26.075
I meant my behavior
with Virginia.

42:27.511 --> 42:34.083
The fact I have sex
with Virginia regularly

42:35.185 --> 42:37.587
with no plans to stop.

42:39.356 --> 42:40.590
You don't
approve of my behavior

42:40.592 --> 42:42.792
because you're
afraid it means
I'll turn into my father.

42:42.794 --> 42:46.829
Well, pressure's off, Mother.
Your fears are realized.

42:46.831 --> 42:50.300
I... I am my father.

42:50.302 --> 42:52.068
You know it.

42:52.070 --> 42:55.138
And now my son
knows it, too.

42:58.075 --> 43:00.777
You know,
the real magic here,

43:00.779 --> 43:04.547
like some dark,
malevolent slight of hand,

43:04.549 --> 43:08.051
is that I have now
also turned into you.

43:10.154 --> 43:11.654

MARGARET: I'm prepared
to buy you a whole
new wardrobe

43:33.678 --> 43:35.545
and then we'll have
a three-martini lunch

43:35.547 --> 43:38.214
and then I might even
buy you a car.

44:28.198 --> 44:31.234
Or was it Essie
that quieted him?

44:32.670 --> 44:37.974
My mother will go
back to Ohio for good.

44:37.976 --> 44:40.309
So you'll need
to get a nanny.

44:40.311 --> 44:42.211
Essie.

44:43.013 --> 44:45.114
What happened?

44:45.282 --> 44:46.716
I need Essie.
I depend on her.

44:46.718 --> 44:50.853
It's done.
And it's the last time
we'll speak of it.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.726
I need to go out
for a few hours.

44:56.728 --> 45:00.563
Maybe you can use this,
uh, moment of quiet

45:00.565 --> 45:01.864
to start making calls.

45:01.866 --> 45:05.168

should start tomorrow.

of transferring to

Ah.

45:38.536 --> 45:41.070
Their school
of nursing does have
an impressive reputation.

45:41.072 --> 45:44.607
It would be good
for me to get out of
St. Louis for a while.

45:44.609 --> 45:47.610
Well, it'd also be
good for you to stay here.

45:47.612 --> 45:48.211
I know, Mom.

45:48.213 --> 45:51.714
You want me to stay
and daddy is desperate
for me to stay.

45:51.716 --> 45:55.284
You both want me
to live here forever
until I'm a spinster.

45:55.286 --> 45:57.587
Oh, Vivvy,
that's not fair.

45:57.589 --> 45:59.689
How about I visit often?

45:59.691 --> 46:02.525
That is a beautiful
color on you.

46:02.926 --> 46:05.394
Maybe I'll even get
you a kitten before I go.

46:05.396 --> 46:08.264
Something to keep
you and daddy company.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.232

46:09.234 --> 46:11.067
Oh, It's that
basement window.

46:11.069 --> 46:12.168
It's okay.
I'll get it.

46:12.170 --> 46:13.736
Uh, you have to...
You have to make...

46:13.738 --> 46:18.374

it latch, and then
you know it's locked.

So thank you.
Thank you both.

47:27.879 --> 47:29.645

a quid pro quo deal,

47:29.647 --> 47:31.380
like everything in life is.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.616
There is not a hospital
in St. Louis

47:33.618 --> 47:37.286
that would not want
Bill's formidable skills

47:37.288 --> 47:38.821
along with his clientele.

47:38.823 --> 47:40.590
But he drives
a hard bargain.

that gets a pretzel vendor

47:43.528 --> 47:46.729
to do his dirty work
for him. (LAUGHS)

if I'd call them dirty.

can be plenty dirty.

to his obstetrical duties.

that pretzel company,

48:06.351 --> 48:09.051
he made a sizeable
donation to the hospital.

comes his study.

to get back to the work.

interesting to our host.

48:33.011 --> 48:33.976
Oh, they're
interesting to me.

And that just
proves what I've been
saying all along.

You, my dear,
are not married to a saint.

away from that study.

48:55.599 --> 48:58.601

the table next time.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.937
I just hadn't told
Libby the details.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.171
It all happened so fast.

49:02.173 --> 49:05.841
Well, if I stepped
in it, I apologize.

49:06.109 --> 49:09.178
Officially,
and as department head,

49:09.180 --> 49:13.716
and as the man married
to Attila the Hun over there,

49:13.718 --> 49:17.253
I agreed to sign off
on your sex study

49:17.255 --> 49:19.288
because it came
with the deal.

been complete madness.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.643

I was hoping
I could see him now?

I, um...

Well, I'm starting
a new job...

50:42.406 --> 50:46.542
...tomorrow at

you came by.

Why you knew
it wasn't a man that
got the better of me?

Because I am not reckless.

I think we are.

54:37.340 --> 54:42.011
And I think it's good
that we clear this up.

54:45.282 --> 54:50.819
Anyway, uh, I imagine
it's a difficult time.

54:51.388 --> 54:55.057
Ethan must be taking
the breakup badly.

54:57.594 --> 54:59.828
He can't understand it.

54:59.830 --> 55:01.163
(CHUCKLES)

55:01.165 --> 55:04.800
Well, he will...
When he gets some distance.

55:04.802 --> 55:07.303
I don't think so.

55:08.538 --> 55:13.342
You know, it is a rare man
that could understand

55:13.344 --> 55:16.111
how a woman could
choose work over love.

55:23.119 --> 55:25.688
Is that what you told him?

55:26.156 --> 55:28.457
Why you ended it?

55:29.459 --> 55:31.427
It was the truth.

55:35.365 --> 55:38.100
I assumed
you were listening.

55:43.640 --> 55:44.707
Bill.

55:44.709 --> 55:46.041
(SCOFFS)

55:46.043 --> 55:48.510
We could have an affair.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.045
Millions of people do.

55:50.047 --> 55:55.718
But an affair, it is
a fairly pedestrian thing.

55:55.720 --> 55:58.854
And the story
always ends the same.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.055
Does it?

56:00.057 --> 56:03.158
What we have
between us is

56:03.993 --> 56:05.761
so much more than that,

56:05.763 --> 56:07.896
more than a simple affair.

56:07.898 --> 56:11.367
We have the work.

56:13.937 --> 56:15.771
Yes.

56:17.140 --> 56:22.111
And we've, uh, participated
in the study many times.

56:22.779 --> 56:25.681
But at your apartment, uh...

56:26.282 --> 56:28.751
Something was different.

56:28.753 --> 56:31.887
There were no wires.

56:35.859 --> 56:36.658
And that interests me.

56:36.660 --> 56:43.165
Uh, you know, perhaps
there is an immeasurable,
uh, quality,

56:43.167 --> 56:47.202
a psychological component
as you've always insisted,

56:47.204 --> 56:55.477
uh, that can bear directly
on the reactions of the body,
physiologically.

56:56.079 --> 56:59.681
I feel there's a whole
separate line of inquiry,

56:59.683 --> 57:00.416
uh, opening up.

57:00.418 --> 57:06.054
And I think it
would be a mistake
to, uh, to end it now.

57:07.724 --> 57:09.458
I agree.

57:09.460 --> 57:14.129
But that does bring me
back, uh, to my apology.

57:14.131 --> 57:17.399
I think... I think you
may have misunderstood

57:17.401 --> 57:19.635
what happened between us.

57:19.836 --> 57:21.970
You refer to
this as an affair.

57:21.972 --> 57:26.074
And you've mentioned
the idea of an affair.

57:26.342 --> 57:26.975
(CHUCKLES)

57:26.977 --> 57:28.944
Of course we're not
having an affair, Virginia.

57:28.946 --> 57:31.280
We never were.
I'm a happily married man.

57:31.282 --> 57:36.018
So I think, uh, continuing
the work is a good idea

57:36.020 --> 57:39.988
but only if you
understand the terms.

57:41.191 --> 57:46.495
I don't want you to feel
like you've been led on.

57:51.534 --> 57:53.836
I understand.

57:58.708 --> 58:00.509
Good.

58:13.690 --> 58:15.724
May I help you, sir?

58:16.593 --> 58:21.830
Uh, my wife and I
would like a...
A room for the night.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.332
I can help you
with that.

58:23.334 --> 58:25.367
And may I get a name?

58:25.635 --> 58:27.402
Holden.

58:27.404 --> 58:34.042
Dr. Francis Holden.
