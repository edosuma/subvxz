Are you OK?

00:33.720 --> 00:35.680
Yeah. What's
your problem?

00:35.680 --> 00:38.320
There's some huge animal
out there, a monster!

00:38.320 --> 00:40.800
I swear,
it almost got me!

00:40.800 --> 00:42.120
Uh...Yeah.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.600
Are you sure it wasn't
a raccoon or a squirrel?

00:44.600 --> 00:46.320
It was bigger
than me.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.560
<i>Did you ever see
a squirrel that big?</i>

00:48.560 --> 00:51.400
No. And I never saw
a monster, either.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.240
Eerrraahh!

00:53.240 --> 00:54.840
Aah!
Aah!

00:54.840 --> 00:56.960
Wait a minute.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.040
Eerr....

00:59.880 --> 01:00.760
Ow!

01:00.760 --> 01:02.360
Ha ha!

01:02.360 --> 01:03.640
Psych!

01:03.640 --> 01:04.760
Very funny.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.120
What, your story
isn't scary enough,

01:08.120 --> 01:10.520
so you gotta
go and pull this?

01:10.520 --> 01:12.560
Oh, it's scary,
all right.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.320
This is just
the setup.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.240
People have been scared

01:20.240 --> 01:22.760
of monsters
in the wilderness forever...

01:22.760 --> 01:25.760
But not just bears
and mountain lions and stuff.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.720
I'm talking about the strange
beast that can't be explained.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.880
Like what?

01:30.880 --> 01:32.920
Like the abominable
snowman of Tibet,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.120
the loch ness monster
of Scotland,

01:35.120 --> 01:38.280
and the flesh-eating giants
of mandalay.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.240
Nobody knows for sure
if these monsters are real,

01:41.240 --> 01:45.040
but a lot of people think so,
because they've seen them.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.440
And tonight,
if you're not too scared,

01:48.440 --> 01:50.400
you might see them, too.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.040
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:53.040 --> 01:55.080
I call this story...

02:18.120 --> 02:20.240
Eew! I've got
poison Ivy!

02:22.800 --> 02:24.680
It's sergeant
slimeball.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.880
Attention!

02:28.880 --> 02:30.080
[Twirr]

02:31.720 --> 02:34.760

bunch of dirtballs like you?!

[Snickers]

02:40.600 --> 02:42.080
Roll the tent

02:42.080 --> 02:44.160
over the back,
dimwit!

02:47.600 --> 02:49.040
It's for dinner:

02:49.040 --> 02:51.880
Pasta with a light
tomato garlic sauce.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.400
Lose it, chubby.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.080
Good. Good.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.760
Volume 6.
First edition.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.800
You bring these, and we're
using 'em to start the fire.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.160
I can't go.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.000
I've got poison Ivy.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.640
I can't go.
I have poison Ivy!

03:20.640 --> 03:22.640
What kinda wimp
are you?!

03:22.640 --> 03:25.520
Any kinda wimp you want.
Just don't make me go!

03:25.520 --> 03:27.360
Put your shoes on.
You're goin'!

03:27.360 --> 03:29.080
Hey, guys, wait up!

03:30.840 --> 03:32.160
Wait!

03:33.640 --> 03:35.200
I thought I was
gonna miss you.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.040
<i>And what do you
want?</i>

03:37.040 --> 03:38.400
I'm coming on
the overnight.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.840
Forget it, runt. You
will never keep up.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.440
You gotta let me come.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.600
Mr. Austrosky
gave me permission.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.000
"How to survive
in the bush,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.640
by Oscar Butz"?!

03:49.640 --> 03:52.040
I've been reading it
all summer

03:52.040 --> 03:54.000
to get ready for
the overnight.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.720
<i>Anything you'll need to
know, you'll learn from me.</i>

04:01.680 --> 04:04.720
You boys are about to
embark on a vision quest,

04:04.720 --> 04:07.080
a test of endurance,
intelligence,

04:07.080 --> 04:09.080
and courage.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.440
None of you have ever spent
a night in the forest.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.520
It's an experience
you'll never forget.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.600
By the time you return
tomorrow,

04:16.600 --> 04:19.680
I'm sure you'll know
a lot more about yourselves

04:19.680 --> 04:21.519
and each other.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.120
Just remember to check
in with the ranger.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.120
I don't want to
have any problems.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.240
Yes, sir!

04:31.680 --> 04:33.120

04:34.120 --> 04:35.960

04:35.960 --> 04:37.120
Forward...

04:37.120 --> 04:38.720
March!

04:42.160 --> 04:45.120
Jonah, are you sure you
wanna go through with this?

04:45.120 --> 04:47.120
Absolutely.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.120
OK.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.400
Have fun.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.160
Yo, Junior!

05:06.600 --> 05:10.240
Keep up unless you wanna be
lunch for some hungry grizzly.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.760
There's grizzlies
out there?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.640
No. Chapter 9.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.160
According to
Oscar Butz,

05:15.160 --> 05:17.800
grizzlies are only found
in Northwestern forests.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.960
The nearest grizzly
is 3,000 miles away.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.400
You saying I'm a liar?!

05:22.400 --> 05:23.640
Uh...No.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.840
I just think your
facts are a little off.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.240
Well, keep your opinions
to yourself.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.240
In fact, doesn't Oscar
Butz have a chapter

05:32.240 --> 05:35.040
that says you must
carry the leader's pack?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.320
Uh, I don't think so.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.040
See? You learned
something new.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.480
Don't make it worse
for us, all right?

05:52.160 --> 05:55.480
Why don't they have pull-off
lids on these things?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.480
Always pack carefully.

Hey...My knapsack!

06:08.560 --> 06:10.520
You idiot!

06:10.520 --> 06:12.000
You pushed me!

06:12.000 --> 06:14.080
Go down there
and get it.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.120
But it's steep!

06:17.120 --> 06:18.600
You wanna climb down

06:18.600 --> 06:21.120
or fall down?!

06:39.320 --> 06:41.120
What are you lookin' at?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.920
Aw, cool!

07:29.400 --> 07:31.440
Beware...

07:31.440 --> 07:33.800
The Manaha have returned.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.360
They have once again

07:35.360 --> 07:38.080
smelled the scent
of human flesh,

07:38.080 --> 07:39.800
and they hunger.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.320
You must leave this place

07:44.320 --> 07:46.320
forever!

07:47.880 --> 07:49.480

where are you?

07:49.480 --> 07:52.280

outta here.

The what?

07:54.880 --> 07:56.480
The Manaha.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.320
Tell them--

07:59.720 --> 08:02.320
What are you
talkin' about?

08:02.320 --> 08:03.800
There was a shaman.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.440
He says there's monsters
out there called Manaha

08:06.440 --> 08:07.920
that'll eat us!

08:07.920 --> 08:09.400
Yeah, sure.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.480
Oh, man.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.680
Hey...

08:14.960 --> 08:16.920
This stuff
is really old.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.440
I mean, people get famous

08:18.440 --> 08:20.480
for discovering
this kind of stuff.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.560
Ha.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.080
Good thing I found it.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.960
You didn't. I did!

08:25.960 --> 08:26.680
Oh!

08:27.480 --> 08:30.560
This's gotta be
worth some bucks!

08:38.000 --> 08:40.919
I'm gonna have my picture
on the front page.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

09:04.240 --> 09:05.720
This thing is heavy.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.840
What is it?

09:06.840 --> 09:08.680
It's a statue
of a Manaha.

09:08.680 --> 09:09.960
A what?

09:09.960 --> 09:12.000
Jonah said
he saw this guy

09:12.000 --> 09:15.360
who told him monsters
are gonna eat us.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.560
This is a joke,
right?

09:17.560 --> 09:18.760
I wish it were.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.240
Yeah, right. Ha ha!

09:20.240 --> 09:21.880
It's no joke!

09:42.440 --> 09:44.880
I'll get it
on the way back.

scared.

I'm not scared.

Don't worry, Jonah.

The bogeyman

Hey, just 'cause
you're chicken

I'm not gonna cook!

I'm not.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.960
[Muttering in
guttural language]

17:19.680 --> 17:20.839
Rraaahh!

17:20.839 --> 17:21.839
Aah!

17:24.680 --> 17:26.319
Guess we found Eddie.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.440
We've gotta
get back.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.480
This way.
Come on.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.240
Look.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.440
I don't believe this.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.360
Yes, you do believe it.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.840
We all believe it.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.360
But Oscar Butz says
fear is only an emotion.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.840
If you believe there are
monsters in the woods,

17:55.840 --> 17:57.920
then there are.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.000
But if you don't...

18:08.920 --> 18:11.200
Then there's nothing
to be scared of.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.480
Lonnie's gone, Jonah.
So is Eddie

18:13.480 --> 18:15.080
and the ranger.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.960
I think that's
pretty real.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.440
There's more going on
here than we think.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.440
So?

18:24.440 --> 18:26.440
So I think we can
save them.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.360
No way! I'm going
back to camp.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.640
Chapter 4.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.360
What happens when you
run from a wild animal?

18:33.360 --> 18:34.680
What?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.040
It chases you.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.760
You guys do what you want.
I'm tired of running.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.400
Don't be scared.

19:08.400 --> 19:12.640
They'll only get you
if you believe in them.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.920
And I don't
believe in them.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.120
[Snarling]

19:19.200 --> 19:21.920
You hear that?

19:21.920 --> 19:24.400
I'm not afraid.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.480
I don't think
you're real,

19:26.480 --> 19:29.960
and if you're not real,
you can't hurt me!

19:39.360 --> 19:40.960
It was just an illusion,

19:40.960 --> 19:43.120
a trick.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.000
But I am no illusion.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.160
I was a powerful
shaman

19:53.160 --> 19:57.600
until my people
sealed me in that cave.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.640
The fools thought my magic
had become too powerful,

20:01.640 --> 20:04.040
too evil.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.800
They said that
I wanted the forest

20:06.800 --> 20:08.640
only for myself.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.880
Perhaps they were right.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.840
Now that you have
released me,

20:17.840 --> 20:20.280
the forest is my hunting
ground once again.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.320
I warned you to leave.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.320
Now it is too late.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.760
Stop!

20:35.760 --> 20:38.760
Put the torch down, now!

20:38.760 --> 20:41.280
Ha ha ha ha ha!

20:41.280 --> 20:42.800
And if I do not?

20:42.800 --> 20:46.400
I'll use the magic in
the statue against you.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.280
The power is not in
the statue, young fool.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.680
It is with me.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.120
Then I summon the Manaha!

21:01.080 --> 21:03.760
Maybe you don't know as much
about magic as you think.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.800
This cannot be.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.400
Away with you!

21:11.320 --> 21:13.360
I no longer need you!

21:13.360 --> 21:15.800
You don't
control them anymore.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.120
<i> I do.</i>

21:17.120 --> 21:18.160
Stop!

21:19.520 --> 21:21.360
I created you.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.160
You do not exist!

21:23.160 --> 21:26.000
I own the Manaha now.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.160
I will make them
destroy you.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.960
I command you
to disappear!

21:36.280 --> 21:39.200
You were put in here
for a reason.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.680
Now you're going back.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.400
No!

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
No!

21:57.600 --> 21:58.440
No! No!

22:00.400 --> 22:01.400
Aah!

22:03.320 --> 22:04.320
Aah!

22:09.360 --> 22:10.520
Jonah!

22:12.280 --> 22:14.240
How'd you do that?

22:14.240 --> 22:16.720
I just used
a little...

22:16.720 --> 22:18.640
Manaha magic.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.160
Manaha, I command you,

22:26.160 --> 22:28.040
show yourselves.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.440
How'd we do?

22:40.440 --> 22:43.640
Meet my Manaha.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.240
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.920
All right.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.160
We've got 5 miles
due west

22:52.160 --> 22:53.680
at 20 minutes per mile

22:53.680 --> 22:55.520
and a half hour break.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.680
And a snack.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.160
And a snack.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.680
We should arrive at camp
in time for lunch.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.760
Everybody set?

23:01.760 --> 23:02.840
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

23:02.840 --> 23:03.960
All right. Let's go!

23:07.360 --> 23:09.000
Pick up the pace,
Lonnie!

23:17.760 --> 23:19.680
Jonah might have been small,

23:19.680 --> 23:23.120
but size has nothing to do
with how brave you are.

23:23.120 --> 23:27.120
<i> That depends on
what's up here...</i>

23:27.120 --> 23:29.120
And in here.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.520
The end.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.720
Good story, Tuck.

23:32.720 --> 23:36.080
[Chittering sound]

23:36.080 --> 23:38.000
Maybe it's
a giant squirrel.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.120
And maybe being small
also means

23:40.120 --> 23:41.680
you gotta run faster!

23:43.680 --> 23:45.600
Hey, you forgot your head!

23:45.600 --> 23:48.120
Let's go catch
the headless gorilla.
