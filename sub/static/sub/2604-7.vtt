WEBVTT

00:00.432 --> 00:03.088
So you did have the document
from Coastal Motors?

00:03.170 --> 00:06.740
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.808
I wasn't objecting
to his question.

00:08.876 --> 00:09.976
Just his tie.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.545
I do have to look at it,
you know.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.581
This is fun,
isn't it, Harv?

00:14.648 --> 00:16.616
Hanging out, catching up,

00:16.684 --> 00:17.751
learning about your fraud.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.686
I hate to burst your bubble,
Trav,

00:19.754 --> 00:21.254
but there was no fraud.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.389
There was no fraud.
What?

00:22.456 --> 00:23.590
You just said,
you had the document.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.258
Yes. We went back through
the case files.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.260
Found the report.
Whoops.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.995
That's it.
"Whoops"?

00:29.063 --> 00:31.197
Hope, you got that.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.367
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?

00:34.435 --> 00:35.835
All right,
you've made your point.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.171
You made us a settlement offer
that we would never take.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.773
Let's talk about
one that we would.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.041
This is a deposition,
not a settlement meeting.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.743
Every meeting
is a settlement meeting.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.311
Fine.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.847
The offer was 5 million,
and Harvey gets disbarred.

00:47.915 --> 00:51.084
How about $100 million?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.319
And Harvey gets disbarred.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.321
Tanner, you want to take
this to court, go right ahead.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.257
I'd rather watch her
cut you down

00:57.324 --> 00:58.825
than see her cut
a deal anyway.

00:58.893 --> 00:59.993
You know,
I see why hairdo

01:00.060 --> 01:01.528
wants to roll the dice,
but why you?

01:01.595 --> 01:04.297
You just went from
5 million to 100 million,

01:04.364 --> 01:05.899
and you're questioning
why I don't want to settle.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.167
If that's a sticking point,

01:07.234 --> 01:08.568
I might be able to go to
0 million.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.370
But the one thing
I won't budge on is

01:10.438 --> 01:12.172
he gets disbarred.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.140
I think I'm doing you
a favor.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.375
And what does he--

01:15.443 --> 01:17.177
cause a headache like this once,
twice a month?

01:17.244 --> 01:18.311
Doesn't matter,

01:18.379 --> 01:19.312
'cause he cures more
than he makes,

01:19.380 --> 01:20.380
like when you stuck your nose

01:20.448 --> 01:22.182
into my case last year,
and he beat you.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.283
Crushed him.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.451
Then he took his ball
and went home.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.319
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.754
Finishing
each other's sentences.

01:27.822 --> 01:29.022
How cute.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.458
No wonder you won't throw him
under the bus.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.725
Good for you, Harvey.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.194
I mean,

01:34.261 --> 01:36.229
you're throwing her
under the bus.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.230
Watch yourself, Tanner.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.598
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.567
Did I offend
your delicate sensibilities?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.268
You want to take
your ball and go home?

01:42.336 --> 01:43.336
I'm gonna take my ball

01:43.404 --> 01:44.270
and shove it up your--
Harvey.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.839
Of course.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.843
Your coifed hair,
your pretty nails.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.445
See? She's the man,
and you're the girl.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.380
You know, it's funny.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.782
I would have thought
she'd prefer someone like--

01:55.850 --> 01:56.983
This deposition is over.

01:57.051 --> 01:58.852
Now what? Is mommy
gonna take you home now?

02:01.188 --> 02:03.890
Wait. That's it.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.993
You got a thing for mommy.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.928
And now it all makes sense.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.231
Because I actually
looked into your mommy,

02:11.298 --> 02:13.299
and it turns out
that the whole time

02:13.367 --> 02:15.068
you were home with daddy,
mommy was out banging--

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.014 --> 02:29.549
Point, Tanner.

02:29.617 --> 02:34.954
I'll see you in court, Harv.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.762
So when did the plan change

02:42.830 --> 02:44.831
from trying to settle
to punching Tanner in the face?

02:44.899 --> 02:46.466
He didn't seem to want
to do the one,

02:46.534 --> 02:48.034
so I did the other.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.103
That's funny.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.337
But he got under your skin,

02:51.405 --> 02:52.906
and that can't happen
when we go to trial.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.408
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.943
Are you suggesting
a trial run?

02:57.011 --> 02:58.778
I don't want
a trial at all but--

03:01.048 --> 03:02.348
We already know your position
is to cut me loose.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.783
Not you.
No.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.051
I'm just one of many partners

03:05.119 --> 03:06.419
who don't know what to think.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.321
And if they don't know
you didn't do it,

03:08.389 --> 03:11.090
how is a jury gonna feel?

03:11.158 --> 03:12.759
You're betting everything
on this trial.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.528
Better make damn sure
you can win.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.565
He's an asshole.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.767
He's right.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.035
All right, what?

03:22.102 --> 03:23.202
If we're gonna do this,

03:23.270 --> 03:25.004
I don't want to waste the chance

03:25.072 --> 03:26.239
to tune you up,

03:26.307 --> 03:28.741
but that means we need
a damn good Tanner.

03:28.809 --> 03:29.742
Are you saying I'm rusty?

03:29.810 --> 03:30.777
When was the last time

03:30.844 --> 03:33.846
you were in the ring?

03:33.914 --> 03:36.416
We don't need a good Tanner.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.585
We need a nasty Tanner.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.053
Someone who will do anything
to beat me.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.922
Someone who makes you want
to punch him in the face.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.560
Oh, you want me to do what?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.295
I just told you four times.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.997
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.365
I'm--I was a little distracted
because I was reading.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.499
Can you just repeat it
one more time?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.001
Look, Louis,
you've had your fun.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.071
When I said the ground rules
were to knock me off my game,

03:58.138 --> 03:59.205
I was talking about the trial.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.540
I know what
you're talking about.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.641
You didn't come to me
because I'm an idiot.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.976
No, not because you're one,

04:03.043 --> 04:04.210
in spite of you being one.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.579
I'm the man for the job,
and you know it.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.381
Actually, I had you
at number five on my list.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.382
And what did Jessica
have me at?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.383
Six.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.384
Okay. I get it. I get it.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.418
You're trying to make me mad.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.820
No, I'm trying
to make you good.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.755
You see, the one thing
you have in common

04:15.823 --> 04:17.123
with Tanner
is your hatred of me.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.291
That is true.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.159
But what you don't have
are his skills.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.928
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.597
Wait, Harvey. Stop.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.899
You don't think I can win?

04:26.967 --> 04:30.036
I know you can't.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.639
This isn't some bank loan,
junior.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.407
Get out.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.409
I've got a trial to prepare for.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.477
And you know what?

04:37.544 --> 04:38.478
When you lose,

04:38.545 --> 04:39.779
do not come crying to me,

04:39.847 --> 04:41.080
because there's nothing
on this earth

04:41.148 --> 04:42.515
that would be sacred enough
to stop me

04:42.583 --> 04:45.318
from shoving your ass
in the goddamn ground.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.519
Good.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.321
Because those are
the real ground rules.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.722
Oh, I see.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.491
Now, you're asking
to get lit up.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.760
Somebody wants to get lit up.

Has Donna called back?

05:32.663 --> 05:35.064
She would be red,
so...

05:35.132 --> 05:36.265
No.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.199
Then those would all be
the same shade

05:37.267 --> 05:38.200
of I-don't-give-a-shit.

05:38.268 --> 05:40.503
Call her again.
Yes.

05:40.570 --> 05:41.504
So?

05:41.571 --> 05:42.905
How was it?

05:42.973 --> 05:44.440
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.

05:44.508 --> 05:46.008
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.

05:46.076 --> 05:47.243
What are you,
in middle school?

05:47.311 --> 05:49.879
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.

05:49.947 --> 05:51.180
Mock trials are for children.

05:51.248 --> 05:52.715
The adults are doing
an in-house trial run.

05:52.783 --> 05:55.051
Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.

05:55.118 --> 05:57.119
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to,
not potato.

05:57.187 --> 05:58.321
What do you need me to do?

05:58.388 --> 05:59.789
What he needs you to do
is help me.

05:59.856 --> 06:01.223
What's this?

06:01.291 --> 06:02.325
You've been drafted.

06:02.392 --> 06:03.459
Okay, what round?

06:03.527 --> 06:05.161
Excuse me?

06:05.228 --> 06:06.495
Sports metaphor.

06:06.563 --> 06:08.597
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.

06:08.665 --> 06:10.232
You've been assigned
by the judge to help me

06:10.300 --> 06:12.268
in pretty boy's trial.

06:12.336 --> 06:13.903
Oh, look at that,
he thinks I'm pretty.

06:13.971 --> 06:16.205
Wait, what judge?

06:16.273 --> 06:17.306
His honor, Daniel Hardman.

06:17.374 --> 06:19.942
I'll see you in court,
sweet tits.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.344
No, no. He can't.

06:21.411 --> 06:22.345
- He can.
- I'm not--

06:22.412 --> 06:23.446
- You are.
- Harvey--

06:23.513 --> 06:25.214
Listen, Louis is devious,

06:25.282 --> 06:26.449
confident, and intelligent.

06:26.516 --> 06:29.552
You forgot ugly, lazy,
and disrespectful.

06:29.619 --> 06:31.220
Now is not the time to quote
<i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

06:31.288 --> 06:33.489
Oh, you mess with the bully,
you get the horn.

06:33.557 --> 06:34.857
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.

06:34.925 --> 06:37.193
Jessica's going against
Muhammad Ali.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.194
She better be able

06:38.261 --> 06:39.495
to beat Joe Frazier.

06:39.563 --> 06:41.931
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay. I get it.

06:41.999 --> 06:44.667
You want me to help
Louis think outside the box.

06:44.735 --> 06:46.469
Exactly. Now, how would
you come after me?

06:46.536 --> 06:48.771
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.

06:48.839 --> 06:50.106
Because you and I
are not discussing

06:50.173 --> 06:52.041
this trial during this trial.

06:52.109 --> 06:53.409
Oh, and you were right.

06:53.477 --> 06:56.212
I know. About what?

06:56.279 --> 06:59.949
Tanner.
It was awesome.

07:10.093 --> 07:11.660
Guess you're not going
to let me win.

07:11.728 --> 07:12.762
Have I ever?

07:12.829 --> 07:13.929
Would I know?

07:13.997 --> 07:16.866
Doubtful.

07:16.933 --> 07:17.767
Have you ever?
I am right now.

07:19.703 --> 07:21.370
Rule number 27:

07:21.438 --> 07:25.474
Never beat the person
you're trying to close.

07:27.110 --> 07:28.778
I always hated rule number 27.

07:28.845 --> 07:30.613
You couldn't close me
five years ago.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.114
What makes you think
you've got a shot tonight?

07:32.182 --> 07:33.115
Didn't.

07:33.183 --> 07:34.250
Not couldn't.

07:34.317 --> 07:35.284
And five years ago,

07:35.352 --> 07:36.285
it wasn't your legal services

07:36.353 --> 07:38.254
I was interested in.

07:38.321 --> 07:40.489
How does Jessica feel
about an employee

07:40.557 --> 07:42.391
who resigned coming back
to consult?

07:42.459 --> 07:43.859
She's onboard.

07:43.927 --> 07:44.860
Do you mean
I have to convince her?

07:44.928 --> 07:45.861
See that?

07:45.929 --> 07:47.329
That's why I want you.

07:47.397 --> 07:50.232
You could've told me
all this on the phone.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.401
Well, I wanted
to see you first.

07:52.469 --> 07:56.072
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.

07:56.139 --> 07:57.273
You know, because--

07:57.340 --> 08:00.042
"I didn't call you back
five years ago"?

08:00.110 --> 08:02.144
Oops.

08:02.212 --> 08:04.280
You think you didn't call me
back five years ago?

08:04.347 --> 08:06.849
Oh, I know I didn't call you
back five years ago.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.951
Well, I hope
your jury consulting

08:09.019 --> 08:10.186
is better than your memory.

08:10.253 --> 08:11.987
I guess we'll have to agree
to disagree.

08:12.055 --> 08:13.255
Because you know I'm right.

08:13.323 --> 08:15.925
Because
I'm a bigger person.

08:15.992 --> 08:20.262
Which is why I'm gonna come in.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.831
But I want to know,
why'd you call me

08:21.898 --> 08:23.899
instead of Ted Phillips?

08:23.967 --> 08:25.734
Why do you think?

08:25.802 --> 08:28.938
They had the document.

08:29.005 --> 08:33.042
They kept it to themselves,
and then they destroyed it.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.111
These are the facts of the case,

08:35.178 --> 08:37.279
and they are undisputed.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.186
Aren't you supposed
to be over there?

08:44.254 --> 08:46.222
You know, I'm just working on

08:46.289 --> 08:47.223
something for work.
Yeah.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.291
And just quoting <i>A Few Good Men.</i>

08:49.359 --> 08:51.927
- For work.
- I know.

08:51.995 --> 08:54.964
Look, I, um...

08:55.031 --> 08:58.334
I have to ask you.

08:58.401 --> 09:01.237
Do you think that
it's at all possible

09:01.304 --> 09:02.905
that he actually did it?

09:02.973 --> 09:05.574
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?

09:05.642 --> 09:07.476
Because I know Harvey.

09:07.544 --> 09:09.078
I mean, how could you think
he could do it?

09:09.146 --> 09:10.946
Because I don't know Harvey.

09:11.014 --> 09:13.015
All I know is that he thinks
he's above the rules,

09:13.083 --> 09:15.351
and he will do
whatever it takes to win.

09:15.418 --> 09:17.820
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--

09:21.124 --> 09:24.226
you don't think
he has integrity.

09:24.294 --> 09:27.329
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.

09:27.397 --> 09:30.232
Oh, Mike.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.869
What happens to you
if Harvey loses?

09:36.940 --> 09:38.474
I don't know.

09:38.542 --> 09:40.476
But right now,
it's not my job

09:40.544 --> 09:42.978
to worry about him losing.

09:43.046 --> 09:44.780
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

09:44.848 --> 09:46.215
guilty is not gray.

09:46.283 --> 09:47.683
You either are or you aren't.

09:47.751 --> 09:51.353
And Harvey Specter is guilty
of concealing that document.

09:51.421 --> 09:54.790
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.

09:54.858 --> 09:56.258
Says his lap dog.

09:56.326 --> 09:58.327
Says the guy who knows
how to beat him.

09:58.395 --> 10:00.129
I'm listening.

10:00.197 --> 10:01.263
How?

10:01.331 --> 10:03.432
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.934
Do you know
how Harvey beat Tanner?

10:05.001 --> 10:06.101
No.

10:06.169 --> 10:07.169
He threatened to commit
perjury to win.

10:07.237 --> 10:09.238
Of course,
it's classic Harvey.

10:09.306 --> 10:10.239
He was bluffing.

10:10.307 --> 10:11.941
But Tanner didn't know that,

10:12.008 --> 10:13.309
and Harvey used against him.

10:13.376 --> 10:15.110
What's your point?

10:15.178 --> 10:16.679
My point is you said
classic Harvey

10:16.746 --> 10:18.214
before you even knew
he was bluffing

10:18.281 --> 10:20.316
because you don't think
Harvey has any integrity.

10:20.383 --> 10:21.784
Nobody thinks
Harvey has integrity.

10:21.851 --> 10:22.952
So then use that

10:23.019 --> 10:26.989
against him.

10:27.057 --> 10:30.859
Easier said than done.
Thanks.

10:30.927 --> 10:32.695
Yeah.
No, you're right.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.063
Maybe it would just be easier

10:34.130 --> 10:35.631
to bug his office
with a dictaphone.

10:35.699 --> 10:38.701
Then use that to get ahead.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.136
I did not use it
for that reason.

10:41.204 --> 10:43.906
Yes, you did, because you are
a devious son of a bitch.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.808
- How dare you--
- Shut up. You know it.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.343
I know it.
Everybody knows it.

10:47.410 --> 10:50.012
I did what I did for
the integrity of the firm.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.180
Then why didn't you take it

10:51.248 --> 10:52.648
to the managing partner
of the firm?

10:52.716 --> 10:53.816
Daniel had a right to know.

10:53.883 --> 10:55.084
And Jessica had a right
to tell him,

10:55.151 --> 10:56.185
but you told him.

10:56.253 --> 10:57.519
You sought out Hardman

10:57.587 --> 10:59.655
because if he comes out on top,
you want him to owe you.

10:59.723 --> 11:01.523
He was there when I heard it.

11:01.591 --> 11:03.325
He asked, I told him.

11:03.393 --> 11:04.960
Oh, so he asked
if Harvey had a secret?

11:05.028 --> 11:07.129
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.

11:07.197 --> 11:08.864
Which is as good
as seeking it out.

11:08.932 --> 11:10.466
Devious.
You weren't there.

11:10.533 --> 11:12.401
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.

11:12.469 --> 11:14.937
Which is exactly
what you need to do to Harvey.

11:26.650 --> 11:28.484
How long
have you been waiting?

11:28.551 --> 11:30.286
How long were
you gonna ignore my calls?

11:30.353 --> 11:32.421
Last I checked,
you haven't called.

11:32.489 --> 11:34.356
I've left you ten voicemails
in the last week.

11:34.424 --> 11:35.724
Huh, that's so weird.

11:35.792 --> 11:36.859
I seem to remember
your assistant

11:36.926 --> 11:39.161
leaving me
ten voice mails.

11:39.229 --> 11:40.963
You know I don't know
how to dial out.

11:41.031 --> 11:42.431
Is it eight?
Is it nine?

11:42.499 --> 11:43.699
Do you know
how to use your cell phone?

11:43.767 --> 11:45.301
Because if I were
your assistant,

11:45.368 --> 11:46.835
I would have totally programmed
my phone number into it.

11:46.903 --> 11:48.570
Oh, wait.

11:48.638 --> 11:51.507
I did.
When I was your assistant.

11:51.574 --> 11:53.309
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.

11:53.376 --> 11:54.943
Did you come here to
tell me things I already know?

11:55.011 --> 11:58.180
No, I came here to see
how you're doing.

11:58.248 --> 12:01.116
You came to get me
to do the trial run.

12:01.184 --> 12:03.085
Donna, it's important.

12:03.153 --> 12:04.186
Yeah, important for me
to get up there and say

12:04.254 --> 12:06.188
I screwed up
trying to protect you?

12:06.256 --> 12:07.523
You did screw up.

12:07.590 --> 12:09.525
Yes.
To protect you.

12:09.592 --> 12:11.060
Which I never asked you to do.

12:11.127 --> 12:12.795
No, you just expected me
to do it.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.431
Like I expected
you to fight for me.

12:15.498 --> 12:17.099
- I did.
- Really?

12:17.167 --> 12:18.434
Like you fought for Mike?

12:18.501 --> 12:20.102
Because that fight,
you somehow managed to win.

12:20.170 --> 12:22.471
Oh, and when you thought
he needed to be fired,

12:22.539 --> 12:25.341
you respected him enough
to do it yourself.

12:25.408 --> 12:28.277
Jessica insisted that
she be the one to let you go.

12:28.345 --> 12:30.879
And since when have you ever
done anything Jessica wanted

12:30.947 --> 12:34.183
if it wasn't
what you wanted too?

12:34.250 --> 12:37.119
Donna, I need you there.

12:37.187 --> 12:40.723
I need you to tell them
that I didn't do this.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.624
I'm sorry, I can't.

12:42.692 --> 12:45.060
I've hired an attorney.

12:45.128 --> 12:46.929
If this thing goes to trial,
I'm gonna be taking the fifth.

12:46.996 --> 12:48.530
So if you need another Donna
at the firm,

12:48.598 --> 12:50.632
just have anybody say,
"I decline to answer,"

12:50.700 --> 12:52.935
because that's all you're
gonna get out of me anyway.

12:53.002 --> 12:55.371
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.

12:55.438 --> 12:59.408
Really?
Really?

13:08.116 --> 13:09.857
You don't get
my kind of track record

13:09.858 --> 13:11.092
just by moneyballing people.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.860
She's the me
of jury consulting.

13:12.928 --> 13:14.962
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.

13:15.030 --> 13:16.998
What kind
of jury would you pick?

13:17.066 --> 13:18.666
I already did.
You need men.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.034
That's a mistake.
Women love me.

13:20.102 --> 13:21.135
Really?

13:21.203 --> 13:22.270
Because I showed them
your photo,

13:22.337 --> 13:24.238
and they described you
as arrogant,

13:24.306 --> 13:26.174
conceited, cocky...

13:26.241 --> 13:27.542
Oh, and arrogant again.

13:27.609 --> 13:28.976
What about handsome?

13:29.044 --> 13:30.278
Did I not mention arrogant?

13:30.345 --> 13:31.512
It's not bragging
if it's true.

13:31.580 --> 13:34.649
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.

13:34.717 --> 13:36.384
Zoe,
I'm still not convinced

13:36.452 --> 13:38.586
I should hire you
instead of Ted Phillips.

13:38.654 --> 13:41.255
After all, Harvey never tried
to sleep with Ted Phillips.

13:41.323 --> 13:42.990
Who says I never tried to
sleep with Ted Phillips?

13:43.058 --> 13:45.460
I can do what Ted can't.

13:45.527 --> 13:47.228
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.

13:47.296 --> 13:49.363
He doesn't like that.
You told her?

13:49.431 --> 13:50.565
I didn't have to.

13:50.632 --> 13:53.468
The partners
don't know what to think.

13:53.535 --> 13:54.635
We don't just need to convince

13:54.703 --> 13:55.837
a jury I'm innocent.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.538
We need to convince
them I'm innocent.

13:57.606 --> 13:58.773
Because if they don't
trust Harvey...

13:58.841 --> 13:59.874
They don't trust me.

13:59.942 --> 14:01.075
And if they don't trust you,

14:01.143 --> 14:03.377
and it ever comes to a vote,
he'll win.

14:03.445 --> 14:05.613
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.

14:05.681 --> 14:06.614
She can read them.

14:06.682 --> 14:08.216
And I also know Hardman.

14:08.283 --> 14:10.118
I never liked him.

14:10.185 --> 14:12.820
I won't tell Hardman
what I tell you.

14:15.691 --> 14:20.128
Welcome back, Zoe.

14:23.432 --> 14:25.466
Please state your name.

14:25.534 --> 14:27.268
Harvey Specter.

14:27.336 --> 14:28.402
Your full name.

14:28.470 --> 14:30.905
Harvey Reginald Specter.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.577
Do you consider yourself
a liar, Mr. Specter?

14:36.645 --> 14:37.578
Of course not.

14:37.646 --> 14:39.080
Didn't you recently confess

14:39.148 --> 14:40.815
that as an associate

14:40.883 --> 14:43.017
you hid an important file

14:43.085 --> 14:44.752
belonging to a--

14:44.820 --> 14:46.387
ooh, what was his name?

14:46.455 --> 14:47.588
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.

14:49.091 --> 14:50.792
That was a prank.

14:50.859 --> 14:51.926
It was a one-time thing.

14:51.994 --> 14:53.661
So you didn't do
anything wrong?

14:53.729 --> 14:55.229
I don't think so.

14:55.297 --> 14:56.464
And when asked,

14:56.532 --> 14:57.632
did you claim that

14:57.699 --> 14:59.534
you knew nothing about it?
Yes.

14:59.601 --> 15:00.535
Did you ever do anything

15:00.602 --> 15:01.736
to remedy the situation?

15:01.804 --> 15:02.837
- No.
- Why not?

15:02.905 --> 15:04.105
What was done was done.

15:04.173 --> 15:05.506
"What was done was done."

15:05.574 --> 15:08.109
And like you said,
it was a one-time thing, right?

15:08.177 --> 15:11.579
- Yes.
- Ah. Was it?

15:11.647 --> 15:14.415
Because I think
maybe this is a pattern.

15:14.483 --> 15:15.850
Information was hidden,

15:15.918 --> 15:17.451
you claim
you knew nothing about it,

15:17.519 --> 15:19.453
you did nothing to rectify
the situation,

15:19.521 --> 15:22.890
and years later, you maintain
you've done nothing wrong.

15:22.958 --> 15:24.225
Your Honor, he's testifying.

15:24.293 --> 15:26.394
Sounds exactly the same
as why we're here today.

15:26.461 --> 15:27.895
Except there's
one big difference.

15:27.963 --> 15:28.896
- Your Honor--
- This time...

15:28.964 --> 15:32.867
A man was killed.

15:35.504 --> 15:39.073
No further questions,
Your Honor.

15:39.141 --> 15:42.376
What's done is done, right?

15:43.645 --> 15:47.281
The plaintiff calls
Ms. Donna Paulsen.

15:49.284 --> 15:51.752
Ms. Paulsen,
did Harvey Specter

15:51.820 --> 15:53.788
order you to shred
this document?

15:53.856 --> 15:57.558
I decline to answer pursuant
to my fifth amendment rights.

15:57.626 --> 16:00.061
So you don't want
to take this opportunity

16:00.128 --> 16:01.462
to state
your employer's innocence?

16:01.530 --> 16:03.130
- Objection.
- You can't object.

16:03.198 --> 16:04.799
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...

16:04.867 --> 16:06.767
Sorry. Yeah.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.636
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider
yourself good at your job?

16:08.704 --> 16:10.004
I do.

16:10.072 --> 16:12.406
Have you ever stated
to one Rachel Zane

16:12.474 --> 16:16.143
that you are indeed the best
legal secretary in the city?

16:16.211 --> 16:17.645
Mike, you can't.

16:17.713 --> 16:19.614
Donna, I can.

16:19.681 --> 16:21.549
Yes.

16:21.617 --> 16:23.551
Ms. Paulsen,
there was a personal date stamp

16:23.619 --> 16:25.086
from five years ago
on the document

16:25.153 --> 16:26.954
that you're accused
of shredding.

16:27.022 --> 16:28.789
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.291
Did it look
like your date stamp?

16:30.359 --> 16:31.525
I decline to answer.

16:31.593 --> 16:33.094
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.

16:33.161 --> 16:35.129
Would you believe
that the best legal secretary

16:35.197 --> 16:37.298
in the city
didn't know about a document,

16:37.366 --> 16:40.334
even though it had what appeared
to be her date stamp on it?

16:40.402 --> 16:43.170
I decline to answer.

16:43.238 --> 16:45.640
And would you believe that
that same secretary

16:45.707 --> 16:47.341
would have destroyed
that document

16:47.409 --> 16:51.512
without explicit orders
from her boss?

16:54.349 --> 16:58.185
This is gonna be bad,
isn't it?

17:00.555 --> 17:02.056
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.

17:02.124 --> 17:03.391
Well, Rachel's not Donna.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.825
She's not guilty,
and she can't be rattled.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.260
You see how I rattled Harvey?

17:06.328 --> 17:08.996
The jury listens to words,
but they respond to fear.

17:09.064 --> 17:11.198
And we don't have that...

17:11.266 --> 17:12.767
Yet.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.301
- What's this?
- Subpoena.

17:14.368 --> 17:16.369
You want to depose me?

17:16.438 --> 17:17.939
Okay, let's stop playing
<i>tiptoe through the tulips</i>

17:18.006 --> 17:19.040
around the elephant
in the room.

17:19.107 --> 17:20.174
That's not a thing.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.108
You know some things
about Harvey,

17:21.175 --> 17:22.343
and I need to know them too.

17:22.411 --> 17:24.244
You yourself said
go after the man.

17:24.313 --> 17:26.380
What better way to go after the
man than to question the boy?

17:26.448 --> 17:27.647
But I don't know anything
about this case.

17:27.715 --> 17:30.151
That's an evasive answer,
Mike.

17:30.218 --> 17:31.886
You're hiding something,
and I smell fear.

17:31.954 --> 17:33.020
I have to go to the restroom.

17:33.088 --> 17:34.989
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?

17:35.057 --> 17:37.925
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.

17:37.993 --> 17:39.393
Good.

17:39.461 --> 17:42.897
What. Whoa, whoa.

17:42.965 --> 17:43.931
Is that a polygraph?

17:43.999 --> 17:44.999
- Yes.
- Nope.

17:45.067 --> 17:46.033
You are under oath.

17:46.101 --> 17:47.535
And I'll tell the truth.

17:47.602 --> 17:48.869
You bet your ass you will,
or I'll know.

17:50.339 --> 17:51.439
We'll start with an easy one.

17:51.506 --> 17:53.808
What's your name?

17:53.875 --> 17:56.210
Mike Ross.

17:56.278 --> 17:57.445
Where do you work?

17:57.512 --> 17:59.547
Pearson Hardman.

17:59.614 --> 18:02.950
What do you do for a living?

18:03.018 --> 18:04.218
I practice law.

18:04.286 --> 18:06.554
And where did you attend
law school?

18:10.092 --> 18:11.192
What?
What's the matter?

18:11.259 --> 18:15.396
Nothing.

18:15.464 --> 18:18.966
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

18:19.034 --> 18:23.904
I beg to differ.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.675
Listen to me.

18:27.743 --> 18:31.045
I know why the machine
says you're lying.

18:33.148 --> 18:34.915
You're nervous.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.384
You don't want
to rat out Harvey.

18:36.451 --> 18:37.618
I get that.

18:37.686 --> 18:40.588
But it's time you accept
the situation.

18:40.655 --> 18:43.424
This is happening,
and you're going to have

18:43.492 --> 18:45.593
to tell me some things
about Harvey.

18:45.660 --> 18:46.727
I accept that.

18:46.795 --> 18:48.629
Then answer
the goddamn question.

18:56.872 --> 19:00.241
I'm proud to say that I have
a diploma from Harvard law.

19:03.211 --> 19:05.579
Now it's time that you accept
the situation.

19:05.647 --> 19:07.681
I'm not afraid of you.

19:07.749 --> 19:09.650
I wasn't there,

19:09.718 --> 19:13.587
and I don't know anything
that's gonna help this case.

19:13.655 --> 19:16.357
Do you want fear?

19:16.425 --> 19:18.259
I'll get you Donna.

19:29.971 --> 19:31.272
The answer's no.

19:31.339 --> 19:34.508
I didn't even ask a question
yet.

19:34.576 --> 19:36.110
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.

19:36.178 --> 19:37.978
And you were gonna say no, but
instead you're gonna say yes.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.947
Oh. That's funny 'cause I
already said no to Harvey.

19:40.015 --> 19:41.849
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.

19:41.917 --> 19:44.351
No, I'm the guy who told you
not to destroy that document,

19:44.419 --> 19:45.920
and you're the girl
who promised me she wouldn't.

19:45.987 --> 19:48.422
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.

19:48.490 --> 19:51.559
Well, then I guess
I just suck.

19:51.626 --> 19:53.761
Because I'm breaking another one
right now.

19:53.829 --> 19:55.229
I told my attorney
that I wouldn't talk to anybody

19:55.297 --> 19:56.764
at the firm
until after this was over.

19:56.832 --> 19:58.199
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.

19:58.266 --> 20:00.601
I'd rather not go to jail.

20:00.669 --> 20:03.604
I don't do roommates, and I
definitely don't do orange.

20:03.672 --> 20:04.972
Nobody's going to jail,
Donna.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.540
You can't guarantee that.

20:06.608 --> 20:08.409
You dragged me
into Harvey's office once,

20:08.477 --> 20:10.077
and you scold me about how much
he loves his job.

20:10.145 --> 20:11.712
Well, if you don't help him
prep for Tanner,

20:11.780 --> 20:13.848
he's gonna lose in court,
he is gonna get disbarred,

20:13.915 --> 20:16.717
and he is never gonna be able
to do what he loves ever again.

20:16.785 --> 20:18.352
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair

20:18.420 --> 20:20.955
is Harvey taking the blame
for your mistake.

20:21.022 --> 20:23.457
You know what, do whatever
your attorney wants.

20:23.525 --> 20:24.658
Come in. Don't come in.
Go to the movies.

20:24.726 --> 20:25.793
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.

20:25.861 --> 20:27.995
Because whatever you do,

20:28.063 --> 20:30.998
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

20:39.777 --> 20:40.813
Complainant would like to call

20:40.814 --> 20:44.282
Ms. Jessica Pearson
to the stand.

20:44.350 --> 20:45.817
Sidebar?

20:50.089 --> 20:51.656
This is just an attempt
to make Harvey's attorney

20:51.724 --> 20:53.258
look bad in front of the jury.

20:53.325 --> 20:54.859
What, you think Tanner's
gonna make you look good?

20:54.927 --> 20:56.061
You're a named defendant.

20:56.128 --> 20:57.295
He has a right to call you.

20:57.363 --> 20:59.864
Louis, will you excuse us
for a moment?

21:03.367 --> 21:05.839
You think I don't see
what you're trying to do?

21:05.840 --> 21:08.341
You want him to undermine me
in front of the partners.

21:08.409 --> 21:10.376
I'm acting
in an unbiased manner.

21:10.444 --> 21:11.511
It sure took you
a while to jump in

21:11.579 --> 21:12.545
when Harvey was up here.

21:12.613 --> 21:14.848
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.

21:14.915 --> 21:18.151
Jessica, you chose
to try this case.

21:18.219 --> 21:21.387
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.

21:21.455 --> 21:24.491
Either take a knee
or take that stand.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.466
Would you say it's important
to win at Pearson Hardman?

21:33.534 --> 21:34.701
You don't get to be one

21:34.768 --> 21:36.569
of the top law firms
in New York by losing.

21:36.637 --> 21:38.605
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.306
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.

21:40.374 --> 21:41.841
Almost always.

21:41.909 --> 21:47.680
Is that why he's the youngest
senior partner in firm history?

21:47.748 --> 21:49.349
It's a factor.

21:49.416 --> 21:50.483
And how much
did the firm benefit

21:50.551 --> 21:53.353
with the Coastal Motors win?

21:53.420 --> 21:55.121
I'd say the profits

21:55.189 --> 21:57.190
were somewhere
in the mid 8 figures.

21:57.258 --> 22:00.560
And if Mr. Specter had lost
those 8 figures,

22:00.628 --> 22:04.497
would he have still made
senior partner so young?

22:06.333 --> 22:08.001
- No.
- Mm.

22:08.068 --> 22:09.836
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter

22:09.904 --> 22:11.804
personally gain
as senior partner?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.206
Oh, it's too soon to say.

22:13.274 --> 22:14.741
He hasn't received
his first bonus yet.

22:14.808 --> 22:16.676
- Ballpark.
- No.

22:16.744 --> 22:19.112
Are you that ashamed
of how much you pay him?

22:19.179 --> 22:20.213
No.

22:20.281 --> 22:24.017
Well, then answer
the question.

22:24.084 --> 22:26.119
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?

22:26.186 --> 22:30.023
Much less.

22:30.090 --> 22:34.327
So win,
and you're rewarded millions.

22:34.395 --> 22:38.798
Win less, and no matter
how much hard work, dedication,

22:38.866 --> 22:44.037
or administrative dominance
is displayed, you get nothing.

22:46.674 --> 22:49.776
Quite the incentive
to do whatever it takes

22:49.843 --> 22:52.545
to "almost always" win.

22:56.517 --> 22:59.953
I have to say, delicious
dinner, fantastic wine...

23:00.020 --> 23:02.488
almost enough to make up
for the mediocre company.

23:02.556 --> 23:05.325
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.

23:05.392 --> 23:08.194
See, that's funny, because
you were talking about me.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.430
There it is,
the Specter smile.

23:10.497 --> 23:12.265
What can I say?
It came with the name.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.133
And you're never fully dressed
without a smile.

23:14.201 --> 23:15.602
Being fully dressed
is overrated.

23:15.669 --> 23:18.171
It is when you look like me.

23:18.238 --> 23:22.208
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying
to seduce me?

23:22.276 --> 23:24.410
Did you just call me
Mrs. Robinson?

23:24.478 --> 23:27.080
Okay, first of all, I'm younger
than Anne Bancroft.

23:27.147 --> 23:28.648
Anne Bancroft was hot.

23:28.716 --> 23:30.183
Which brings me
to second of all.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.951
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.

23:32.019 --> 23:33.486
I'm hotter
than Dustin Hoffman.

23:33.554 --> 23:35.521
- Not in <i>Tootsie.</i>

23:37.224 --> 23:40.059
Are you afraid you're gonna lose
this thing?

23:40.127 --> 23:41.794
No.

23:41.862 --> 23:43.997
You should be.

23:44.064 --> 23:45.431
Why, because Louis
had one good direct?

23:45.499 --> 23:48.368
You walk through life like men
want to be you

23:48.435 --> 23:50.036
and women want to sleep
with you.

23:50.104 --> 23:51.204
I don't always walk.

23:51.271 --> 23:52.972
Sometimes I drive fast.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.707
And it's exactly
that kind of response

23:54.775 --> 23:56.676
that make the partners think
you're an ass.

23:56.744 --> 23:58.911
Being an ass doesn't make me
guilty of fraud.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.880
If they're right
about who you are,

24:00.948 --> 24:01.981
what would make them think

24:02.049 --> 24:03.016
they'd be wrong
about what you do?

24:03.083 --> 24:04.817
Well, why don't you tell me?

24:04.885 --> 24:07.387
You're the expert
on warm and fuzzies.

24:07.454 --> 24:10.657
You want to know how I know I
wasn't the one to call you back?

24:10.724 --> 24:14.360
Because I know why I wasn't
the one to call you back.

24:14.428 --> 24:16.529
Let me guess--
you didn't like me.

24:16.597 --> 24:18.131
No, I did.

24:18.198 --> 24:20.633
But in all the time
I knew you,

24:20.701 --> 24:23.469
you never once showed me
any vulnerability.

24:23.537 --> 24:25.138
I told you
how I felt about you.

24:25.205 --> 24:29.175
But you never showed me.

24:29.243 --> 24:32.178
So I had no way of knowing
it's the truth.

24:32.246 --> 24:34.247
And you could be telling
the truth now,

24:34.314 --> 24:36.549
but if you don't show
the partners some emotion,

24:36.617 --> 24:38.418
they're not gonna believe you
either.

24:38.485 --> 24:41.454
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?

24:41.522 --> 24:42.855
Harvey,
when you're a defendant,

24:42.923 --> 24:45.992
you need the jury
to protect you.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.194
There's no way
they're ever gonna protect you

24:48.262 --> 24:51.731
if they don't care about you.

24:54.068 --> 24:56.069
The plaintiff
would like to call

24:56.136 --> 24:59.405
Ms. Donna Paulsen
to the stand.

25:11.185 --> 25:12.852
You got her to come in?

25:12.920 --> 25:15.455
Just stick to the script.

25:15.522 --> 25:18.458
Harvey won't know
what hit him.

25:18.525 --> 25:21.360
Ms. Paulsen,

25:21.428 --> 25:25.631
did Harvey Specter order you
to shred that document?

25:25.699 --> 25:29.802
I decline to answer pursuant
to my fifth amendment rights.

25:29.870 --> 25:31.237
Did you put your date stamp
on that document?

25:31.305 --> 25:35.575
- I decline to answer.
- Um...

25:37.878 --> 25:39.612
I'm not gonna ask questions

25:39.680 --> 25:43.983
that you're just gonna plead
the fifth to, so...

25:50.724 --> 25:52.391
Had Harvey Specter asked you

25:52.459 --> 25:55.061
to bury something
five years ago, would you?

25:55.129 --> 25:56.229
He wouldn't ask me to do that.

25:56.296 --> 25:57.864
That's not what I asked.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.433
If he did,
would you do it?

26:04.037 --> 26:06.372
Oh, see, you're pausing, which
means you're hiding something.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.573
No, I'm not.

26:07.641 --> 26:09.575
See, I think
you'd do anything for him,

26:09.643 --> 26:11.744
and I know why.

26:11.812 --> 26:13.479
Is there a question?

26:13.547 --> 26:16.616
Do you love Harvey Specter?

26:16.683 --> 26:18.017
What?

26:18.085 --> 26:20.019
Do you love him?

26:20.087 --> 26:21.988
That has nothing to do with--

26:22.055 --> 26:23.956
It has everything to do with.

26:24.024 --> 26:27.493
Why did your last boyfriend
break up with you?

26:27.561 --> 26:30.429
Ms. Paulsen, why did he
end it with you?

26:30.497 --> 26:32.799
He thought that I prioritized
my work over our relationship.

26:32.866 --> 26:34.033
Your work?

26:34.101 --> 26:36.135
He asked you to choose
between him and Harvey,

26:36.203 --> 26:38.271
didn't he?

26:38.338 --> 26:41.274
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?

26:46.246 --> 26:47.814
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?

26:47.881 --> 26:49.048
Louis, stop.

26:49.116 --> 26:50.116
It is not that simple.

26:50.184 --> 26:53.119
Do you love him, yes or no?

26:53.187 --> 26:54.821
Answer the question.
Louis.

26:54.888 --> 26:56.722
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.

26:56.790 --> 26:58.057
Your life revolves around him.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.625
Objection, badgering.

26:59.693 --> 27:00.993
You don't have a boyfriend,

27:01.061 --> 27:02.495
but the one you did
wouldn't share you with him.

27:02.563 --> 27:04.130
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--

27:04.198 --> 27:05.398
Do you love Harvey Specter?

27:05.465 --> 27:06.632
Do you love Harvey Specter?

27:06.700 --> 27:09.302
That's enough!

27:25.452 --> 27:28.554
Donna.

27:53.447 --> 27:55.648
You crossed the line.

27:55.716 --> 27:56.782
Do not do this to me
right now.

27:56.850 --> 27:58.417
You humiliated Donna.

27:58.485 --> 28:00.653
You kept pushing and pushing her
for what, for fun?

28:00.721 --> 28:01.921
What, you think
I enjoyed that?

28:01.989 --> 28:03.689
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.

28:03.757 --> 28:05.992
You think Tanner
would have stopped?

28:06.059 --> 28:09.095
Travis Tanner does not give
a shit about Donna Paulsen.

28:09.162 --> 28:10.830
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--

28:10.898 --> 28:12.698
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.

28:14.468 --> 28:18.237
You really want to beat me
that badly, huh?

28:18.305 --> 28:20.806
You think
this is about beating you?

28:20.874 --> 28:23.809
This whole thing
is about saving you.

28:23.877 --> 28:28.214
Everyone is trying to help you
because you screwed up.

28:28.282 --> 28:32.051
This is all your fault.

28:32.119 --> 28:33.605
And what just happened

28:33.606 --> 28:35.090
to that beautiful woman
in there--

28:35.115 --> 28:37.005
that's on you--

28:39.556 --> 28:41.556
not me.

29:03.977 --> 29:04.977
Are you kidding me?

29:05.044 --> 29:07.279
Go home.
Shoo!

29:07.347 --> 29:08.614
Go the hell home.

29:08.681 --> 29:10.082
Look, I didn't know
he was gonna do that.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.316
And if you had known,

29:11.384 --> 29:12.751
would you have done one thing
differently?

29:12.819 --> 29:13.919
I am so sorry.

29:13.987 --> 29:16.154
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.356
Bullshit. Bullshit.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.324
- Okay. Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.

29:19.392 --> 29:20.726
I know.

29:20.793 --> 29:23.295
But you know what, sweetheart,
maybe you are.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.198
And I do not mean that
as a compliment.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.699
Look, I did what I did
for the same reason

29:27.767 --> 29:30.369
you did what you did,
to help Harvey, that's all.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.804
Well, that worked out the same
for you as it did for me,

29:32.872 --> 29:34.406
because,
in case you hadn't noticed,

29:34.474 --> 29:36.208
in addition to screwing me,
you completely shafted Harvey.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.342
We had a script.

29:37.410 --> 29:39.711
Wait,
you trusted Louis?

29:39.779 --> 29:41.813
You trusted Louis?

29:41.881 --> 29:42.981
Yeah, I thought
he would stick to it.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.449
Yes.
Well, he didn't.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.485
And you should have known that,
because that is just who he is.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.620
I am sorry.
But I'm--

29:50.690 --> 29:52.157
People are who they are.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.359
Thank you.
Okay.

29:54.427 --> 29:55.560
I can fix this!

30:05.405 --> 30:06.972
What's all this?

30:07.040 --> 30:10.242
It wouldn't concern you.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.211
Why is that?

30:13.279 --> 30:14.312
Because you want to settle
even if it means

30:14.380 --> 30:15.814
Harvey getting disbarred.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.516
If he loses in court,
he'll get disbarred anyway.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.351
My concern is for the firm.

30:19.419 --> 30:21.586
It's not a personal attack
against Harvey.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.823
This whole thing is a personal
attack against Harvey.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.959
And you're gonna do something
about it?

30:29.662 --> 30:33.765
Tanner's cases, transcripts,
appeals, decisions.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.001
I know he did something illegal,
because that's who he is,

30:36.069 --> 30:38.203
and I'm gonna find it,
because that's who I am.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.539
What are you planning on doing
with it?

30:40.606 --> 30:42.240
Leveraging that
for a settlement?

30:42.308 --> 30:44.109
I'm not against settling.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.944
I'm against Harvey
getting disbarred.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.579
You really admire him.

30:47.647 --> 30:50.348
- I do.
- Loyalty.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.616
You can't buy that.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.553
No.
You can't.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.426
What are you doing?

31:01.494 --> 31:04.796
We worked together
all night once.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.798
Let's do it again.

31:08.868 --> 31:12.037
I hope this time turns out
better than the last time.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.441
Now we have them
right where we want them.

31:16.509 --> 31:17.909
Either you're better
than I thought you were,

31:17.977 --> 31:19.878
or you have absolutely no idea
what you're doing.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.881
Trust me, the partners
are starting to believe Harvey.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.082
Why?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.784
Because he protected Donna.

31:25.852 --> 31:27.385
He was also protecting
himself.

31:27.453 --> 31:28.787
Yes.
But they didn't see that.

31:28.855 --> 31:32.157
They saw a man who cared
about someone else.

31:32.225 --> 31:34.726
His softer side.

31:34.794 --> 31:36.628
And we need to give them more.

31:36.696 --> 31:38.163
He won't want to.

31:38.231 --> 31:40.031
And we both know Harvey
won't do

31:40.099 --> 31:41.266
what he doesn't want to do.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.768
Everybody knows that.

31:42.835 --> 31:44.636
So what do we do?

31:49.976 --> 31:52.244
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.311
Permission granted.

31:53.379 --> 31:54.980
He's hostile.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.281
The day we met,
you were working

31:56.349 --> 31:58.116
in the mail room
of this law firm.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.417
I don't recall that day.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.585
Well, let me refresh
your memory.

32:00.653 --> 32:02.954
An associate
had missed a filing,

32:03.022 --> 32:05.190
so he backdated the postage.

32:05.258 --> 32:06.658
You came to me,

32:06.726 --> 32:10.395
and you said if the firm
did not declare misconduct,

32:10.463 --> 32:12.230
you would report us
to the D.A.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.633
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.734
But what you did want
to keep secret

32:15.802 --> 32:17.736
was the fact that you told me.
Why?

32:17.804 --> 32:19.271
I didn't want
to get in trouble.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.373
No, you did it
because if we'd won,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.842
an old woman
would have lost her pension.

32:23.910 --> 32:26.344
And if anyone found out
that he was the one

32:26.412 --> 32:29.147
that told me,
then they'd know that you cared.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.515
Whatever you say.

32:30.583 --> 32:33.819
You pretend like you
don't care, but you do.

32:33.886 --> 32:35.821
You care about the people
you work with,

32:35.888 --> 32:38.056
you care about the people
you work for,

32:38.124 --> 32:41.092
and you care about every one
of your clients.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.162
But you refuse
to let people know.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.231
Is there a question?

32:46.299 --> 32:49.334
I just want to know why.

32:51.838 --> 32:53.038
No answer?

32:53.105 --> 32:54.239
Are you embarrassed?

32:54.307 --> 32:56.208
Nope.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.576
- Afraid?
- No.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.211
Then why?

32:59.278 --> 33:01.479
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.114
Then hold me in contempt.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.383
For God sakes, what the hell
happened to you?

33:05.451 --> 33:07.986
What kind of damage
was done to you?

33:08.054 --> 33:11.256
Caring only makes you...

33:11.324 --> 33:13.358
Weak.

33:14.794 --> 33:20.065
They think you care,
they'll walk all over you.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.535
You weren't weak the day
you walked into my office.

33:23.603 --> 33:29.474
You were a man who believed
that to win fairly

33:29.542 --> 33:32.344
was more important
than to win.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.814
And you still are.

33:35.882 --> 33:40.585
And I've never seen anyone
walk all over you.

33:40.653 --> 33:45.657
Is there a question here,
Your Honor?

33:48.027 --> 33:50.328
No, there isn't.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.177
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.246
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.748
Excuse me?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.416
You said you wanted to see
through me, you did.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.418
The least you can do is give me
an honest answer.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.288
Yes, it was my idea.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.857
Harvey, your partners
loved what they saw in there.

34:18.925 --> 34:20.425
You're gonna win.

34:20.493 --> 34:21.993
Bravo.

34:22.061 --> 34:25.730
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?

34:25.797 --> 34:27.197
It was so great.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.266
But there isn't one shred
of proof it's true.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.069
Hostile witness,
my ass.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.804
I mean, before that story,
we all believed you did it.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.672
And I ask you, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

34:34.739 --> 34:37.141
if he did commit that fraud,
how hard is it to believe

34:37.208 --> 34:38.842
that he didn't concoct
some bullshit on the stand

34:38.911 --> 34:41.612
to get himself off the hook?

34:41.681 --> 34:43.014
That's my close.

34:44.984 --> 34:47.652
We have one more witness
to call.

34:50.456 --> 34:54.059
Mr. Litt, do you resent
Harvey Specter?

34:54.126 --> 34:55.659
It's complicated.

34:55.728 --> 34:56.928
No, it's simple.

34:56.996 --> 34:59.130
Do you resent him
for being better than you?

34:59.198 --> 35:00.966
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.034
It's so much easier
to criticize someone else

35:03.102 --> 35:06.938
than it is to acknowledge
your own shortcomings.

35:07.006 --> 35:08.640
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.

35:08.708 --> 35:10.175
My billables
are higher than his.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.843
My client list
is better than his.

35:11.911 --> 35:13.645
Yes, but I didn't ask you
about those things.

35:13.713 --> 35:15.146
What are you asking,
Ms. Pearson?

35:15.214 --> 35:18.016
Does the witness
resent my client?

35:21.220 --> 35:24.222
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside,

35:24.290 --> 35:28.226
do you think Harvey Specter
deserves to be senior partner?

35:30.730 --> 35:32.030
Yes or no?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.135
Yes.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.803
Do you think
he's an excellent attorney?

35:41.374 --> 35:45.410
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him,

35:45.478 --> 35:47.412
do you think he committed
this fraud?

35:54.153 --> 35:55.153
No.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.959
Defense rests.

36:18.217 --> 36:22.621
Refusing to admit defeat
even after defeat.

36:22.688 --> 36:24.222
You really are like Harvey.

36:24.290 --> 36:26.057
I'm not so sure
that's a good thing.

36:26.125 --> 36:27.526
Well, who would you rather be?

36:27.593 --> 36:28.827
Someone who believes
it's more important

36:28.895 --> 36:30.796
to win fairly
than to win.

36:30.863 --> 36:33.865
Like I said, Harvey.

36:33.933 --> 36:35.033
Yeah.
Not in this case.

36:35.101 --> 36:36.968
You both cheated.

36:37.036 --> 36:38.537
Excuse me?

36:38.604 --> 36:40.806
Louis's testimony pushed it
over the top.

36:40.873 --> 36:42.941
But that jury,
they didn't see Louis Litt

36:43.009 --> 36:45.510
believing Harvey's innocence--
they saw Travis Tanner.

36:45.578 --> 36:50.282
And that is never gonna happen
in court.

36:50.349 --> 36:56.021
You do realize that you are
chastising the managing partner.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.656
With all due respect,

36:57.723 --> 37:00.091
it's not gonna matter what you
are if Harvey gets disbarred.

37:00.159 --> 37:02.527
We'll find a way to win.

37:04.163 --> 37:06.131
You should be finding a way
to settle.

37:06.199 --> 37:08.400
There isn't
an acceptable offer.

37:08.467 --> 37:11.102
Yet.

37:11.170 --> 37:13.939
Not just a pretty face.

37:29.655 --> 37:31.489
I hope you brought
a baseball bat.

37:31.557 --> 37:33.258
You want to go another round
with me, you're gonna need it.

37:33.326 --> 37:34.693
It doesn't matter what I have,

37:34.760 --> 37:35.894
you're just gonna sucker punch
me again anyway.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.797
Boohoo.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.565
You baited me.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.101
You wanted to catch me
on that tape, and you know it.

37:43.169 --> 37:45.737
That's not what I'm talking
about, and you know it.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.305
You want to settle?

37:47.373 --> 37:48.673
Let me save you some time.

37:48.741 --> 37:49.741
We pass.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.543
You can pass,
you can sign it,

37:51.611 --> 37:53.044
or you could stick it
up your ass,

37:53.112 --> 37:55.747
but this is the best
you're getting.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.582
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.085
You think I don't know
this was your doing?

38:00.152 --> 38:03.021
Harvey, next time have the balls
to do it yourself

38:03.089 --> 38:04.589
instead of sending
your errand boy.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.324
Errand boy?

38:06.392 --> 38:08.326
You got what you wanted,
so stop playing dumb.

38:08.394 --> 38:11.296
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.

38:18.504 --> 38:20.805
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.

38:20.873 --> 38:23.942
A good deal that costs every
partner at this firm $100,000.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.343
Including me.

38:25.411 --> 38:27.178
We share the profits;
We share the losses.

38:27.246 --> 38:29.381
There won't be a loss
when I win this at trial.

38:29.448 --> 38:32.450
The only reason
you weren't willing to settle

38:32.518 --> 38:34.286
was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.454
And I want to know
how you made it go away.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.757
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?

38:38.824 --> 38:40.825
You blackmailed him
into a settlement.

38:40.893 --> 38:43.061
I leveraged a deal
that's good for the firm.

38:43.129 --> 38:44.729
I said, "what dirt?"

38:44.797 --> 38:46.331
Not your concern.

38:46.399 --> 38:47.799
It's my concern.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.801
I don't want what you did
biting me in the ass.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.636
You were already bitten.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.205
And the last time I crossed the
line and you found out about it,

38:54.273 --> 38:56.174
it bit me in the ass.

38:56.242 --> 38:58.243
You cleared Harvey's name
inside the firm.

38:58.311 --> 39:00.578
We both know
that's what you wanted.

39:05.017 --> 39:07.819
Time to move on.

39:09.655 --> 39:12.590
Let's let the partners
put this to a vote.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.370
Hardman got Tanner to settle.

39:25.438 --> 39:27.906
Are you kidding?

39:27.974 --> 39:29.808
It worked?

39:29.875 --> 39:32.010
So it was your idea
to use dirt to get a deal.

39:32.078 --> 39:35.714
No, it was my idea to use
Tanner against Tanner.

39:35.781 --> 39:37.449
Box.

39:37.516 --> 39:39.084
Me.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.420
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.

39:42.488 --> 39:44.089
It's okay.
You don't have to.

39:44.156 --> 39:45.256
And I'm not going to,

39:45.324 --> 39:46.992
'cause we're not
taking the deal.

39:52.365 --> 39:54.199
Because you don't trust
Daniel.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.667
This isn't just about me.

39:55.735 --> 39:59.004
Every partner is--
everybody is paying now.

40:00.773 --> 40:05.110
Do you have any idea why Donna
showed up to testify?

40:05.177 --> 40:07.679
Because I convinced her to.
What?

40:07.747 --> 40:09.114
Yeah, I made her do
what I needed

40:09.181 --> 40:10.382
instead of what she wanted.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.117
I did what you do.

40:12.184 --> 40:13.651
And look where that's gotten us,
you, me,

40:13.719 --> 40:16.488
Jessica, Louis, everybody.

40:16.555 --> 40:18.156
Take the deal, Harvey.

40:18.224 --> 40:20.191
What did Hardman find
in those files?

40:20.259 --> 40:21.659
I don't know,
and I don't care,

40:21.727 --> 40:24.329
because he just got every single
one of us off the hook.

40:24.397 --> 40:25.997
He can't be trusted,
and you should know that by now.

40:26.065 --> 40:29.200
No, what I know is that if you
take this thing to trial,

40:29.268 --> 40:33.471
it's gonna cost us all a hell
of a lot more than money.

40:35.307 --> 40:39.110
And if you don't know that
by now, after all this,

40:39.178 --> 40:43.681
then I don't think I should be
the one learning from you.

40:47.787 --> 40:49.521
This is your decision.

40:49.588 --> 40:53.691
So, by a show of hands,
those in favor of settling?

41:02.568 --> 41:04.903
Thank you.

41:04.970 --> 41:10.041
Now all those in favor
of going to trial.

41:15.681 --> 41:19.084
Split vote.

41:19.151 --> 41:22.020
And it appears
we have a holdout.

41:27.726 --> 41:30.662
I vote we settle.

41:36.735 --> 41:42.474
Let the record show
we have settled.

41:42.541 --> 41:46.444
Thank you for your time.

41:46.512 --> 41:47.779
In light of recent events,

41:47.847 --> 41:51.316
there is one other issue
I'd like to raise.

41:51.383 --> 41:54.185
This lawsuit has caused
some of you to question

41:54.253 --> 41:57.789
Jessica's judgment and,
by extension, her leadership.

41:57.857 --> 42:02.627
Allowing this kind of dissention
to fester hurts the entire firm.

42:02.695 --> 42:06.831
Therefore, I am calling
a partners' meeting,

42:06.899 --> 42:09.467
at which point we will vote:

42:09.535 --> 42:13.872
Either Jessica will retain her
position as managing partner,

42:13.939 --> 42:17.242
or I will resume control
of Pearson Hardman.
