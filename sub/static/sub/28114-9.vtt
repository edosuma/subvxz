WEBVTT

00:23.002 --> 00:24.201
DURHAM:
My father had few friends.

00:24.303 --> 00:27.237
A cathedral full of
acquaintances, but few friends.

00:27.339 --> 00:29.940
Murray Fox was one of them.

00:30.042 --> 00:31.341
They'd both kill me
for saying so.

00:31.444 --> 00:33.243
-(light laughter)
-A Jew from the Bronx.

00:33.345 --> 00:35.212
An Irish Catholic from Westport.

00:35.314 --> 00:38.182
But they-they thought
of each other like brothers.

00:38.284 --> 00:41.135
And so, on behalf of the Friars,

00:41.237 --> 00:44.238
hither and yon,
past and present,

00:44.340 --> 00:46.340
it is my deep pleasure

00:46.442 --> 00:50.010
to honor Murray with this sketch

00:50.112 --> 00:52.346
to join our cadre.

00:52.448 --> 00:54.181
And you, Sam,

00:54.283 --> 00:58.252
we bestow the title:
Honorary Friar in Perpetuity.

01:02.041 --> 01:03.907
Thank you.

01:04.009 --> 01:06.110
Oh, my God. Wow.

01:06.212 --> 01:07.978
Um...
(clears throat)

01:08.080 --> 01:11.181
my father loved being a Friar,
and he loved coming here,

01:11.283 --> 01:12.399
and this means a lot.

01:12.501 --> 01:15.235
I get a free martini right?
'Cause...

01:15.337 --> 01:17.304
-(light laughter)
-Um, it's a nice perk.

01:17.406 --> 01:19.406
But anyway... thanks, Durham.

01:19.508 --> 01:21.175
Okay. Thank you.

01:21.277 --> 01:24.978
I remember you were always
so much older than me,

01:25.081 --> 01:27.314
and now we're
exactly the same age.

01:27.416 --> 01:29.233
How did that happen?

01:29.335 --> 01:31.135
Mm. I don't know.

01:31.237 --> 01:33.403
I do.

01:34.473 --> 01:36.140
It's this hair.

01:36.242 --> 01:38.041
My God.

01:38.144 --> 01:41.278
You have no right
to have such good hair.

01:42.381 --> 01:44.148
You can do it again if you want.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.432
(both laugh)

01:47.303 --> 01:49.203
So, off topic.

01:49.305 --> 01:50.204
-No.
-What?

01:50.306 --> 01:51.371
I don't want to hear about

01:51.507 --> 01:53.273
how you shtupped Anne Bancroft

01:53.375 --> 01:55.375
when you were
at the tender age of 15.

01:55.478 --> 01:57.111
-You don't?
-Or any of those.

01:57.213 --> 01:58.312
That's an unsubstantiated rumor,
you know.

01:58.414 --> 02:00.013
(laughing):
Yeah.

02:00.116 --> 02:02.065
It's true. And look at you.
You, you know...

02:02.134 --> 02:04.001
it's not like you haven't had
your world tour.

02:04.103 --> 02:06.069
No. No. Child actor.

02:06.172 --> 02:08.038
Married. Now I'm dead.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.140
(laughs)
Hardly.

02:11.443 --> 02:13.210
So, off topic.

02:13.312 --> 02:15.379
Do you think it's true...

02:15.481 --> 02:18.115
do you think your father
and my mother,

02:18.217 --> 02:20.400
during that five-year period

02:20.503 --> 02:23.137
when Cormic and Murray
weren't speaking to each other,

02:23.239 --> 02:25.038
do you think they, uh... did it?

02:25.141 --> 02:26.206
-What?
-Yeah.

02:26.308 --> 02:29.143
-That was over a script.
-Mm-hmm.

02:29.245 --> 02:31.912
I don't think... N-No.

02:32.014 --> 02:33.147
I don't know. I don't know.

02:33.249 --> 02:34.982
It's not like Cormic was, uh,

02:35.084 --> 02:36.366
the most faithful of men.

02:38.137 --> 02:40.070
Well, Murray would never...

02:40.172 --> 02:43.307
I mean, he was terrified
of my mother's wrath.

02:43.409 --> 02:45.108
(Durham chuckles)

02:45.211 --> 02:47.277
Your mom was a babe, though.
I remember.

02:47.379 --> 02:49.913
Yeah. I remember your mom, too.

02:50.015 --> 02:51.248
-She was hot.
-She was...

02:51.350 --> 02:52.966
-Hi, baby.
-Oh.

02:53.068 --> 02:54.334
-Hey.
-Hi.

02:54.436 --> 02:56.136
-I thought you had to do the...
-I know. Jeremiah's set isn't

02:56.238 --> 02:57.171
-until 11:00.
-Oh.

02:57.273 --> 02:59.940
-I'm Ruth.
-Oh, yes. Sam.

03:00.042 --> 03:01.975
Sam. Uh, this is Sam.

03:02.077 --> 03:03.143
We grew up together.

03:03.245 --> 03:04.178
SAM:
Mm-hmm.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.079
Yeah. We grew up together.

03:06.182 --> 03:08.081
Except he was older.
Much older.

03:08.184 --> 03:10.200
-(Durham chuckles)
-So much older.

03:10.302 --> 03:12.202
-You know the feeling?
You know what I mean, Ruth?
-(cell phone buzzing)

03:12.304 --> 03:13.237
Just a second. Hello?

03:13.339 --> 03:14.238
Wait. Actually, no, honey.

03:14.340 --> 03:15.372
You can't take it. No calls.

03:15.474 --> 03:17.007
Will you take that in the lobby?

03:17.109 --> 03:18.308
Seriously?

03:18.410 --> 03:20.110
Seriously. It's-it's a rule.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.179
(Durham sighs)

03:22.281 --> 03:23.447
-It's a rule.
-RUTH: Hello?

03:25.301 --> 03:27.367
RUTH (fading into distance):
Hey. You're here? Yeah.

03:27.469 --> 03:29.169
-She's adorable.
-Just stop it.

03:29.271 --> 03:31.071
-Stop it. Stop it.
-I didn't... I'm not even...

03:31.173 --> 03:32.139
-Don't. Don't. Come on.
-Okay.

03:32.241 --> 03:33.340
It's not like I asked for that.

03:33.442 --> 03:35.943
-(grunts)
-This isn't a demographic

03:36.045 --> 03:37.945
-I go casting my net for.
-Mm-hmm.

03:38.047 --> 03:40.080
-It's not...
-Yeah, I mean,
because it's not like there's

03:40.182 --> 03:44.034
a whole swath of women
in their 40s and 50s

03:44.136 --> 03:46.103
who are totally available,

03:46.205 --> 03:49.006
with great minds
and better bodies,

03:49.108 --> 03:51.375
-lovely, sweet, amazing,
-Mm.

03:51.477 --> 03:54.011
next-level, recently divorced,

03:54.113 --> 03:55.279
-well-adjusted,
-I know.

03:55.381 --> 03:58.115
ready to go out
and share a meal,

03:58.217 --> 04:01.001
have a good time, not boring.

04:01.103 --> 04:03.337
And you just
skip over all of them.

04:03.439 --> 04:07.140
I mean, you guys
just skip a whole generation.

04:07.243 --> 04:08.141
Or three.

04:08.244 --> 04:09.276
All right, I know, I know.

04:09.378 --> 04:11.144
And-and, by the way, I agree.

04:11.247 --> 04:13.180
You know?
I have lived a bunch of life,

04:13.282 --> 04:15.115
and now I'm just
glomming onto hers,

04:15.217 --> 04:17.434
you know, and it's...
it's not fair.

04:17.536 --> 04:19.436
I-I don't know why
she agrees to it. (chuckles)

04:19.538 --> 04:21.471
-It's, you know...
-Mm-hmm.

04:23.008 --> 04:23.907
I'm speechless.

04:24.009 --> 04:25.042
(whispers):
Yeah, it's...

04:25.144 --> 04:26.243
it's tough.

04:26.345 --> 04:28.412
-I feel for you. I mean...
-(Durham grunts)

04:30.416 --> 04:32.199
But anyway...

04:32.301 --> 04:34.201
-I'll leave you to Ruth.
-Oh, come on.

04:34.303 --> 04:36.303
Sam, Sam, come on,
she'll be gone in 20.

04:36.405 --> 04:39.039
She is 20, bro.

04:40.142 --> 04:41.074
Let's have dinner later.

04:41.176 --> 04:43.076
Peace out, Friar Durham.

04:43.178 --> 04:44.945
Oh, the hair!

04:45.047 --> 04:46.179
Come on. Sam.

04:46.282 --> 04:47.914
This was fun.

04:48.017 --> 04:49.299
Deuces!

04:49.401 --> 04:52.202
Text me if you change your mind.

04:52.304 --> 04:55.005
¶ Cigarette smoke
is in my eyes ¶

04:55.107 --> 04:58.008
¶ And I can't see your face ¶

04:58.110 --> 05:00.444
¶ I'm heading home
the long way... ¶

05:08.470 --> 05:10.370
¶ ¶

05:10.472 --> 05:12.072
(bicycle bell rings)

05:12.174 --> 05:14.141
(birds chirp, squawk)

05:18.113 --> 05:19.479
Hi. Thanks.

05:21.283 --> 05:24.067
What are you doing in my hotel?

05:24.169 --> 05:25.936
This is my hotel.

05:26.038 --> 05:28.038
It's definitely my hotel.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.272
Oh, okay.

05:31.243 --> 05:34.344
Um... I didn't think
you were coming in for this.

05:34.446 --> 05:36.947
Yeah, I'm gonna see yours
and a couple other readings.

05:37.049 --> 05:39.366
Oh. Cool.

05:39.468 --> 05:42.202
You know, I'm really
l-looking forward to it.

05:42.304 --> 05:43.303
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

05:43.405 --> 05:45.939
Yeah. Do you have an early call?

05:46.041 --> 05:48.008
No, no, no, not too early.

05:48.110 --> 05:49.309
Not too early.

05:49.411 --> 05:52.079
That's so funny that you're
staying in my hotel.

05:52.181 --> 05:53.980
Well, you have good taste;
I have good taste.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.048
-Mm-hmm.
-Makes sense.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.134
Yeah, we can go with that.

05:58.203 --> 05:59.369
Are you freaked out?

05:59.471 --> 06:02.339
No. No! No. No.

06:02.441 --> 06:04.374
No, no, no, no, no.

06:04.476 --> 06:06.109
No. Just...

06:06.211 --> 06:07.511
(clears throat)
Anyway...

06:09.448 --> 06:13.100
I don't want you to think
that I'm rude, but...

06:13.202 --> 06:15.102
I have to, uh,
FaceTime my daughters

06:15.204 --> 06:17.037
and go up to my room, but..

06:17.139 --> 06:19.406
it's really good...
I'm gonna see you...

06:19.508 --> 06:22.142
tomorrow at the reading.

06:22.244 --> 06:24.010
Thank you.

06:24.113 --> 06:26.413
I'm gonna...
I just... 'cause...

06:26.515 --> 06:28.115
(quietly):
I mean, it's great.

06:28.217 --> 06:29.299
You have good taste,
I have good taste,

06:29.401 --> 06:31.001
we're staying in a hotel.

06:31.103 --> 06:32.235
(loudly):
I'll see you tomorrow, Mer.

06:32.337 --> 06:33.303
Good night.

06:33.405 --> 06:36.073
Anyway, seriously, sorry.

06:36.175 --> 06:38.275
I told my daughters
that I would Face...

06:38.377 --> 06:40.410
It's better in the room.
I'll see you tomorrow.

06:40.512 --> 06:43.046
Thank you.

06:43.148 --> 06:44.314
Anyway...

06:46.168 --> 06:48.335
¶ ¶

06:48.437 --> 06:52.172
¶ If you'd only start
to kiss me once ¶

06:52.274 --> 06:56.209
¶ And say "I love you"
some more ¶

06:56.311 --> 07:00.213
¶ But you're either
very bashful ¶

07:00.315 --> 07:03.934
¶ Or else
just a little bit sore ¶

07:04.036 --> 07:08.105
¶ So if you really want
to baby me ¶

07:08.207 --> 07:11.475
¶ Then, baby,
why not do the thing right ¶

07:11.577 --> 07:15.145
¶ Because you really
disappointed me ¶

07:15.247 --> 07:17.414
¶ When you forgot to ¶

07:17.516 --> 07:21.034
¶ Kiss me good night ¶

07:22.137 --> 07:23.303
¶ Good night. ¶

07:23.405 --> 07:25.038
WOMAN:
Hey, Sam.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.940
-Hi.
-We're on the main stage.

07:27.042 --> 07:29.109
Okay, cool.

07:30.345 --> 07:32.312
MARK (chuckles):
Uh-oh.

07:32.414 --> 07:34.014
-Nice.
-Cute.

07:34.116 --> 07:36.099
Yeah. Nice green shirt.
I see you got the memo.

07:36.201 --> 07:38.068
SAM (laughs):
Yes!

07:38.170 --> 07:41.004
-You're my brother!
-We hate each other.

07:41.106 --> 07:42.272
-Yeah, this is gonna be hard.
-I know.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.240
-We're gonna have to act.
-Yeah, you think

07:43.342 --> 07:45.041
-you got it in you?
-I think I do.

07:45.144 --> 07:46.376
-I'm not sure about you.
-Me, too.

07:46.478 --> 07:49.112
-¶ ¶
-(indistinct chatter)

07:49.214 --> 07:50.380
Good morning, sunshines.

07:50.482 --> 07:52.115
-Good morning.
-OTHERS: Hi!

07:52.201 --> 07:54.401
(indistinct chatter)

07:57.306 --> 07:59.372
Aunt Sissy and I haven't seen
each other since, uh, what?

07:59.475 --> 08:01.341
I saw you at Joe's Pub
last month.

08:01.443 --> 08:03.176
-Oh. Last month.
-Yeah.

08:03.278 --> 08:04.377
Thanks, man.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.313
¶ ¶

08:06.415 --> 08:09.065
Hi. Didn't read the script.
Did you guys read it?

08:10.102 --> 08:11.434
(sighs)

08:11.503 --> 08:14.171
Everybody, your character's name
is on your script.

08:14.273 --> 08:16.406
Just a few announcements.
We are on a straight six

08:16.508 --> 08:18.408
with a half-hour lunch,
and I think

08:18.510 --> 08:21.111
we have an Equity deputy here--
Jon Jon.

08:21.213 --> 08:23.013
-So concerns go to him.
-(whooping)

08:23.115 --> 08:25.382
-Jon Jon!
-Oh, my God. No, not you.

08:25.501 --> 08:27.067
(chuckles) Can we take
another vote, please?

08:27.169 --> 08:29.035
-MARK: Yeah.
-Your deputy commands you.

08:29.137 --> 08:31.171
-(chuckles) Yes, Mama.
-(light laughter)

08:31.273 --> 08:33.340
Now we'll turn it over
to your director Trevor.

08:33.442 --> 08:35.141
-Yes!
-Trevor!

08:35.244 --> 08:38.044
-(clapping)
-What's up, guys?

08:38.146 --> 08:39.246
Thank you for coming in today.

08:39.348 --> 08:40.981
Um, I've been working
on this play

08:41.083 --> 08:43.300
for a couple years now
with Mook.

08:43.402 --> 08:45.202
(whistling, clapping)

08:45.304 --> 08:47.070
I'm gonna speak
for the both of us.

08:47.172 --> 08:49.973
We think this play
is pretty tight, so...

08:50.075 --> 08:52.075
we're not really looking
for a bunch of ad-libbing

08:52.177 --> 08:54.277
or suggestions.

08:54.379 --> 08:57.047
So, just do what's on the page.

08:57.149 --> 08:58.415
Basically, after Williamstown,

08:58.517 --> 09:01.935
the play's been getting
a lot of buzz,

09:02.037 --> 09:03.970
uh, both here and the West End.

09:04.072 --> 09:07.207
So, basically, I'll stop you
if I have any adjustments.

09:07.309 --> 09:11.278
But otherwise,
we're gonna try for a few reads

09:11.380 --> 09:13.380
and get it up onstage.
Cool.

09:13.482 --> 09:15.215
MARK:
I-I never get cold sores.

09:15.317 --> 09:16.433
I just feel,
like, a little tingle.

09:16.535 --> 09:18.335
-Oh, Jesus.
-NORM: You never get cold sores,

09:18.437 --> 09:21.171
-and you got a whole tub
of lysine in your bag? Okay.
-MAN: What?

09:21.273 --> 09:23.206
Okay, relax, Norm.
All right, relax.

09:23.308 --> 09:24.507
-SAM: Wait. I'm moving over.
-NORM: Scary.

09:24.610 --> 09:27.010
-Give Daddy a kiss.
Put it right there.
-(laughing): No.

09:27.112 --> 09:28.245
HOLLAND:
Come over here and sit by me.

09:28.347 --> 09:31.248
-I'm immune.
-(laughter)

09:31.350 --> 09:34.067
-Give me one. Now I'm scared.
-Okay. Yeah, you never know.

09:40.676 --> 09:42.042
"Deserted truck stop
outside of Ames.

09:42.144 --> 09:45.345
Copulating like swine
under a lone sodium lamp."

09:45.447 --> 09:47.948
This is straight out
of a Hopper painting.

09:51.136 --> 09:53.203
Oh, shit. It's me. Sorry.

09:53.305 --> 09:55.372
-NORM: I called you.
That's points right there.
-JON JON: Were you?

09:55.474 --> 09:58.908
-Maybe.
-Either you were or you weren't.

09:59.011 --> 10:01.378
Uh, look, uh,
I'm sorry for stopping,

10:01.480 --> 10:03.380
but did I call?

10:03.482 --> 10:07.100
I mean, you did, and you didn't.

10:08.470 --> 10:10.236
Gotcha.

10:10.339 --> 10:14.140
And have shards of broken
bottles shoved down my throat

10:14.242 --> 10:18.078
while being lowered slowly
into a vat of rabid rats.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.280
Um, okay.
I'm gonna stop you right there.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.134
Sam...

10:24.236 --> 10:26.036
I...

10:26.138 --> 10:30.073
really feel like you're enjoying
this torture scenario.

10:30.175 --> 10:32.075
And, like,

10:32.177 --> 10:34.377
you're playing it at an eight,
and I'm gonna need you

10:34.479 --> 10:37.080
to take it down to, like, a six.

10:37.182 --> 10:38.965
(chuckles)

10:39.067 --> 10:40.133
-(whispers): A six.
-TREVOR: Okay, good.

10:40.235 --> 10:42.135
-So, uh, let's take it again.
-MARK: Okay.

10:42.237 --> 10:45.005
Well, I would rather, uh,
get the hairs of my balls

10:45.107 --> 10:46.272
-plucked one by one.
-(Trevor clears throat)

10:46.375 --> 10:48.908
Okay, guys,
it's still a little hot, guys.

10:49.011 --> 10:51.978
Um, the comedy lies

10:52.080 --> 10:53.947
in this being...

10:54.049 --> 10:55.382
a totally...

10:55.484 --> 10:59.235
you know, like...

10:59.338 --> 11:02.372
you know... kind of tone.

11:02.474 --> 11:04.074
Yeah?

11:04.176 --> 11:06.126
-(soft chuckle)
-Uh, yeah.

11:06.211 --> 11:08.044
-Totally.
-We... Uh, we know.

11:08.146 --> 11:09.312
-Sure.
-TREVOR: Oh, crap.

11:09.414 --> 11:11.281
We got to take a lunch.
All right.

11:11.383 --> 11:13.266
-Half hour, people.
-That was, like, a seven.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.969
-TREVOR: Thanks.
-SAM: It lies in the tone.

11:16.071 --> 11:17.203
I mean, it's not good, right?

11:17.305 --> 11:19.005
(chuckling):
Yeah.

11:19.107 --> 11:20.340
There's no way they're
bringing this to Broadway.

11:20.442 --> 11:22.075
You never know.

11:22.177 --> 11:24.277
We haven't drunk
the Kool-Aid yet. Just wait.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.012
-(cell phone ringing)
-It's the home front.

11:26.114 --> 11:27.981
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.966
(door opens, bell jingles)

11:30.068 --> 11:31.101
(door closes)

11:31.203 --> 11:32.335
Huh?

11:33.405 --> 11:35.105
Really?

11:38.009 --> 11:39.976
Oh. Mark.

11:40.078 --> 11:41.344
Huh?

11:41.446 --> 11:43.046
Nice.

11:49.638 --> 11:51.071
(indistinct chatter)

11:51.173 --> 11:53.206
¶ Ooh ¶

11:53.275 --> 11:56.342
¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ¶

11:59.448 --> 12:01.948
¶ La, la-la, la... ¶

12:02.050 --> 12:04.300
(applause, cheering)

12:11.443 --> 12:13.276
TREVOR:
<i> So, we're gonna go</i>

12:13.378 --> 12:15.111
straight through,
no intermission.

12:15.213 --> 12:19.015
Let's do the play.
<i> Skewered</i> by Mook Simmonds.

12:19.101 --> 12:21.201
Watch the axe impacting my skull

12:21.303 --> 12:23.203
and have shards
of broken bottles

12:23.305 --> 12:25.205
shoved down my throat

12:25.307 --> 12:29.109
while being lowered slowly
into a vat of rabid rats.

12:29.211 --> 12:30.110
Really?

12:30.212 --> 12:32.245
That sounds like joyous rapture.

12:32.347 --> 12:34.948
He told me
he wanted to marry you.

12:36.401 --> 12:37.867
What?

12:37.969 --> 12:39.269
He said he was crazy for you.

12:40.439 --> 12:42.872
What are you talking about?

12:42.974 --> 12:45.108
-Maybe you should tell her.
-Absolutely not!

12:45.210 --> 12:46.242
Don't even think about it!

12:46.344 --> 12:48.111
Jon.

12:50.215 --> 12:52.115
-It's time.
-It's time?

12:52.217 --> 12:54.234
¶ Windows on the world... ¶

12:54.336 --> 12:56.035
That's funny coming from you.

12:56.138 --> 12:58.338
HOLLAND:
I don't care about
the gossip of the thing.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.240
I care about the thing!

13:00.342 --> 13:04.077
We're talking wha-what?
30 years?

13:04.179 --> 13:06.279
-It doesn't matter.
-I'm a hundred million
years old now.

13:06.381 --> 13:07.347
Doesn't matter to me.

13:07.449 --> 13:09.165
I am sick of it!

13:09.267 --> 13:12.235
I am sick of being the Lenny
to your George.

13:12.337 --> 13:15.939
Okay, I'm not sitting in
the audience watching the movie

13:16.041 --> 13:18.141
of your life!

13:18.243 --> 13:20.143
Your quarter's up.

13:20.245 --> 13:21.311
¶ That floor
you're standing on ¶

13:21.413 --> 13:22.378
Now it's your turn.

13:22.481 --> 13:25.999
¶ Ain't gonna sweep itself ¶

13:26.101 --> 13:27.200
GABRIELLE (crying):
<i> His whole life</i>

13:27.302 --> 13:29.302
just clamps down.

13:29.404 --> 13:32.305
Literally clamps down.

13:32.407 --> 13:36.042
¶ Painting every room... ¶

13:36.144 --> 13:38.912
I can't do anything.

13:41.082 --> 13:44.934
(cheering and applause)

13:50.976 --> 13:53.209
MAN:
Bravo! Bravo!

13:53.311 --> 13:55.044
(cheering, whistling)

13:55.146 --> 13:57.247
-You killed it. You killed it.
-That was awesome.

13:57.349 --> 13:59.866
-A couple things.
-(both laugh)

13:59.968 --> 14:01.968
-I hope they get the funding.
It was just wonderful.
-Wow.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.102
-MARK: Thanks, Trevor.
-GABRIELLE: Thank you.

14:03.205 --> 14:04.304
The audience really
loved it, man.

14:04.406 --> 14:06.272
-Amazing writing.
-Thank you.

14:06.374 --> 14:08.942
You know, I was in an apartment
with my parents on one side

14:09.044 --> 14:11.010
and my brother and his wife
and their baby on the other.

14:11.112 --> 14:12.212
-What was the title?
<i> -9JKL.</i>

14:12.314 --> 14:14.047
-SAM: And I get afraid...
-Oh.

14:14.149 --> 14:15.381
-Yeah, not a great title.
-...because I-I feel like

14:15.483 --> 14:17.100
-I'm hoarding it.
-Hey.
-Yeah, well, you are.

14:17.202 --> 14:19.002
-Hi. Hi.
-Hey.

14:19.104 --> 14:20.270
-Oh, sorry.
-We'll see you at Dear John's.

14:20.372 --> 14:21.971
-Oh, okay.
-All right.

14:22.073 --> 14:24.007
Yeah. I'll-I'll meet up
with you guys.

14:24.109 --> 14:27.343
Hi. Good? Was it good...?
I think it's good, right?

14:27.445 --> 14:29.312
I was chatting with the folks
from the festival,

14:29.414 --> 14:31.014
and Mook loves you, of course.

14:31.116 --> 14:32.999
Really? Mm.

14:33.101 --> 14:34.300
How come Tressa didn't know?

14:34.402 --> 14:36.970
Oh.
Healthy boundary around that.

14:38.073 --> 14:39.172
I mean... (exhales)

14:39.274 --> 14:41.241
I never would have done this.

14:41.343 --> 14:44.310
I never would have been able
to even...

14:44.412 --> 14:47.881
be part of this
if you hadn't set it up.

14:47.983 --> 14:49.899
How come she didn't know that?

14:50.001 --> 14:51.234
I'm not good at strategies.

14:51.336 --> 14:53.903
Isn't that what a manager's
supposed to do?

14:54.005 --> 14:55.305
(scoffs)

14:55.407 --> 14:59.208
We've been together 20 years.
We're like family.

14:59.311 --> 15:03.012
But you're asking me
if I could do a Broadway run?

15:03.114 --> 15:05.181
Well, yes, I would like to.

15:05.350 --> 15:07.400
I would like to say
that I did that,

15:07.502 --> 15:09.269
that I was on Broadway.

15:09.371 --> 15:10.370
Then you should do it.

15:10.472 --> 15:12.138
I can talk to Tressa for you.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.373
There are ways
to make this work.

15:13.475 --> 15:15.174
Oof.

15:15.277 --> 15:17.210
All right, well,
I'll see you back in L.A.

15:17.312 --> 15:18.378
Wait. What are you doing?

15:18.480 --> 15:20.980
I got to go up to my room,
make some calls.

15:21.082 --> 15:23.967
But the cast-- we're all gonna
go have drinks and sing songs.

15:24.069 --> 15:25.335
(chuckling):
I need to work.

15:25.437 --> 15:28.972
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Please, please.

15:29.074 --> 15:32.208
Okay, let's just go in here
for one drink. One drink, okay?

15:32.310 --> 15:35.044
-Okay, one drink.
-Okay, good.

15:35.146 --> 15:36.346
-(cell phone ringing)
-Ooh. I'm sorry.

15:36.448 --> 15:38.881
-That's all right.
-Wait. Hang on.

15:38.984 --> 15:40.333
Do you mind if I take this?

15:40.435 --> 15:42.101
Yeah, I'll order for you.

15:42.203 --> 15:44.137
Okay. Thanks.

15:46.141 --> 15:47.974
(sighs)

15:48.076 --> 15:49.142
Hello.

15:49.244 --> 15:51.344
-TRESSA: How'd it go?
-The reading?

15:51.446 --> 15:53.947
No, the opera.
Yes, the reading.

15:54.049 --> 15:56.065
SAM:
Well, there's a lot of buzz.

15:56.167 --> 15:58.968
Mer says they're gonna take it
to Broadway.

16:00.138 --> 16:01.137
Oh, Mer's there.

16:01.239 --> 16:02.972
(sighs)
Yeah, she's the one

16:03.074 --> 16:04.273
who thought of me for this.

16:06.177 --> 16:08.411
You know, she figured
that the playwright and I

16:08.513 --> 16:11.047
might connect, so...

16:11.149 --> 16:12.315
Mer told you this?

16:12.417 --> 16:15.001
Yeah, after the thing. What?

16:16.371 --> 16:18.304
-So, you want to do it?
-I don't know.

16:18.406 --> 16:20.940
But this is good. It's good.

16:21.042 --> 16:23.276
I'm gonna make this
an easy conversation for you.

16:23.378 --> 16:25.345
What conversation?

16:25.447 --> 16:29.015
You obviously feel the need
to move on to greener pastures.

16:29.117 --> 16:31.300
And I get it.
We've been together a long time.

16:31.403 --> 16:33.136
And we both respect each other.

16:33.238 --> 16:35.872
But you feel the need
to shake things up.

16:35.974 --> 16:38.207
I don't. I'm not saying that.
Have I said that?

16:38.309 --> 16:40.943
And I value our friendship
too much to stand in your way.

16:41.046 --> 16:43.012
This conversation
has been a long time coming.

16:43.114 --> 16:45.014
Since the movie.
And I want you to feel

16:45.116 --> 16:46.265
that you have the support
you need,

16:46.334 --> 16:48.034
-so I will step aside.
-Wait. Wait, wait, wait,

16:48.136 --> 16:49.302
wait, wait, wait. Tressa.

16:49.404 --> 16:51.871
You don't need to say
another word. I get it.

16:51.973 --> 16:52.972
Best of luck to you, Sam.

16:53.074 --> 16:54.040
(groans)

16:55.377 --> 16:57.243
(scoffs)

16:57.345 --> 16:59.245
-What? Just now?
-Mm-hmm.

16:59.347 --> 17:01.314
-Just now.
-Why?

17:01.416 --> 17:03.232
I don't know. She's jealous.

17:03.334 --> 17:05.301
She gets her feelings hurt
all the time.

17:05.470 --> 17:07.970
I can't ever tell her
about anything that goes on.

17:08.073 --> 17:09.372
She's always like,
"Well, I wanted to go

17:09.474 --> 17:11.007
to the thing with you."

17:11.109 --> 17:12.942
Why? I didn't invite you.

17:13.044 --> 17:15.211
-You hurt her feelings.
-Yes.

17:15.313 --> 17:18.247
I can't stand working
with women.

17:18.349 --> 17:21.134
I hate it.
They get so fricking emotional.

17:21.236 --> 17:23.236
Uh-huh. Anything that smells
like a feeling,

17:23.338 --> 17:24.370
you can't do that. (inhales)

17:24.472 --> 17:26.005
-Can't do that.
-Look,

17:26.107 --> 17:27.306
I get what feelings are,

17:27.409 --> 17:30.109
but I also know how women are,
and it is so boring.

17:30.211 --> 17:32.345
I know this is bait
and I should walk away from it,

17:32.447 --> 17:35.214
but I kind of can't because
it's absurd what you're saying.

17:35.316 --> 17:36.933
Yeah, it's also kind of true.

17:37.035 --> 17:38.267
Someone should punch you
for saying it.

17:38.369 --> 17:40.169
I mean, I know it looks like
I'm getting worked up.

17:40.271 --> 17:41.938
I know it looks like
you're riling me up,

17:42.040 --> 17:43.906
but you're just so wrong.

17:44.008 --> 17:45.875
So essentially wrong.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.143
Women are
so much more complicated

17:47.245 --> 17:48.344
than the way
you're portraying them.

17:48.446 --> 17:49.979
You're just ragging on them

17:50.081 --> 17:51.247
'cause of your own suppressed,
fearful bullshit,

17:51.349 --> 17:53.132
so you got to put it
all over women.

17:53.234 --> 17:54.333
I wish you would
just evolve already.

17:54.436 --> 17:56.335
-You evolve.
-You evolve.

17:56.438 --> 17:57.970
You evolve.

17:58.073 --> 17:59.172
(chuckling):
You evolve.

17:59.274 --> 18:01.074
(chuckles)

18:05.447 --> 18:08.014
Would you like me
to do something about this?

18:08.116 --> 18:09.932
About Tressa?

18:10.034 --> 18:12.235
No, not about Tressa.

18:12.337 --> 18:13.469
About this.

18:15.507 --> 18:17.006
Oh.

18:17.108 --> 18:18.407
Um...

18:18.510 --> 18:20.409
Oh.

18:20.512 --> 18:23.045
Yes or no?

18:24.249 --> 18:26.048
(sighs)

18:27.102 --> 18:29.035
Yes or no?

18:34.042 --> 18:38.377
I'm not... not saying no.

18:40.381 --> 18:42.181
You're really something else.

18:43.234 --> 18:45.301
Uh, what?

18:46.371 --> 18:49.038
Come on, Sam. Come on.

18:49.140 --> 18:51.274
Look, you say things to me,

18:51.376 --> 18:53.276
and you look at me
a certain way,

18:53.378 --> 18:55.311
and I get dizzy.

18:55.413 --> 18:58.214
You know,
it feels like flirting.

18:58.316 --> 19:00.933
-But that's not what it is.
-It is.

19:01.035 --> 19:03.136
It feels like flirting
because it is.

19:03.238 --> 19:04.871
No, no, no. I'm...

19:05.039 --> 19:06.939
It's a line
from<i> Hannah and Her Sisters.</i>

19:07.041 --> 19:09.075
"I'm a little buzzed
from all this flirting."

19:09.177 --> 19:11.110
I'm fine. Either way, I'm fine.

19:11.212 --> 19:13.179
But just so you know,
I didn't misinterpret.

19:13.281 --> 19:15.181
I didn't pick up on something
that wasn't there.

19:15.283 --> 19:17.300
And I'm not even blaming you.

19:17.402 --> 19:19.168
I know better. I do.

19:19.270 --> 19:21.170
I've seen it a thousand times.

19:21.272 --> 19:23.039
Seen what?

19:23.141 --> 19:24.307
Oh, that's right.

19:24.409 --> 19:26.142
"I don't know what's happening."

19:26.244 --> 19:27.977
Your entire sense of self

19:28.079 --> 19:30.046
has been scrambled.
I get it. I've scrambled you.

19:30.148 --> 19:31.347
It doesn't make sense
for you to be attracted to me.

19:31.449 --> 19:32.965
I don't have a dick.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.001
Well, I have a sack
full of dicks. But still...

19:35.103 --> 19:37.069
I understand. Confusing.

19:37.172 --> 19:39.305
Wait, go back.
You have a sack of them?

19:39.407 --> 19:41.174
(chuckles):
No. No.

19:41.276 --> 19:43.142
And yet, my dear,

19:43.244 --> 19:45.011
even if you don't know
what it means,

19:45.113 --> 19:46.245
I've been around this block

19:46.347 --> 19:49.215
many, many more times
than you have.

19:49.317 --> 19:51.934
So there's no need
to gaslight me.

19:52.036 --> 19:53.369
No need.

19:55.406 --> 19:57.139
We'll just call it a draw.

20:11.272 --> 20:13.105
Good night, then.

20:14.275 --> 20:16.242
See you.

20:25.136 --> 20:27.036
WOMAN:
<i> This song is great.</i>

20:27.138 --> 20:28.905
Okay!

20:29.007 --> 20:31.874
¶ I have often walked ¶

20:31.976 --> 20:34.977
¶ Down this street before ¶

20:35.079 --> 20:40.967
¶ But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before ¶

20:41.069 --> 20:44.003
¶ All at once am I ¶

20:44.105 --> 20:47.173
¶ Several stories high ¶

20:47.275 --> 20:54.046
¶ Knowing I'm on the street
where you live ¶

20:54.148 --> 20:57.066
¶ Are there lilac trees ¶

20:57.168 --> 21:00.269
¶ In the heart of town? ¶

21:00.371 --> 21:07.076
¶ Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town? ¶

21:07.178 --> 21:10.212
¶ Does enchantment pour ¶

21:10.315 --> 21:13.299
¶ Out of every door? ¶

21:13.401 --> 21:19.238
¶ No, it's just on the street
where you live ¶

21:19.340 --> 21:20.973
WOMAN:
Here we go.

21:21.075 --> 21:27.146
¶ And, oh,
the towering feeling ¶

21:27.248 --> 21:34.070
¶ Just to know
somehow you are near ¶

21:34.172 --> 21:39.175
¶ The overpowering feeling ¶

21:39.277 --> 21:44.146
¶ That any second
you may suddenly appear ¶

21:44.248 --> 21:45.948
(woman laughs)

21:46.050 --> 21:49.235
¶ People stop and stare ¶

21:49.337 --> 21:52.938
¶ They don't bother me ¶

21:53.041 --> 21:59.312
¶ For there's nowhere else on
Earth that I would rather be ¶

21:59.414 --> 22:03.065
¶ Let the time go by ¶

22:03.167 --> 22:08.237
¶ I won't care if I ¶

22:08.339 --> 22:15.244
¶ Can be here on the street
where you live ¶

22:15.346 --> 22:21.934
¶ And, oh,
the towering feeling ¶

22:22.036 --> 22:26.339
¶ Just to know
somehow you are near ¶

22:26.441 --> 22:28.407
-I'm here.
-There you are.

22:28.509 --> 22:34.180
¶ The overpowering feeling ¶

22:34.282 --> 22:40.236
¶ That any second
you may suddenly appear ¶

22:40.371 --> 22:43.139
MAN:
Hey, Norm, take us home.

22:43.241 --> 22:47.076
¶ People stop and stare ¶

22:47.178 --> 22:50.212
¶ They don't bother me ¶

22:50.314 --> 22:56.302
¶ For there's nowhere else on
Earth that I would rather be ¶

22:56.404 --> 23:01.907
¶ Let the time roll by ¶

23:02.009 --> 23:07.279
¶ I won't care if I ¶

23:07.382 --> 23:12.301
¶ Can be here on the street ¶

23:12.403 --> 23:21.327
-¶ Where you live. ¶
-(cheering)

23:21.412 --> 23:23.312
(cheering, whooping)

23:23.414 --> 23:25.381
(Norm laughs)

23:32.373 --> 23:33.906
(whistles)

23:34.008 --> 23:36.008
¶ Daisy, Daisy ¶

23:36.110 --> 23:39.912
¶ Give me your answer, do ¶

23:40.014 --> 23:43.199
¶ I'm half crazy ¶

23:43.301 --> 23:46.235
¶ All for the love of you ¶

23:46.337 --> 23:50.038
¶ It won't be
a stylish marriage ¶

23:50.108 --> 23:53.209
¶ I can't afford a carriage ¶

23:53.311 --> 23:56.312
¶ But you'll look sweet
upon the seat ¶

23:56.414 --> 23:59.081
¶ Of a bicycle built for two ¶

23:59.183 --> 24:00.232
-MAN:<i> One more time!</i>
-NORM:<i> Oh!</i>

24:00.334 --> 24:03.335
¶ Daisy, Daisy ¶

24:03.438 --> 24:07.206
¶ Give me your answer, do ¶

24:07.308 --> 24:10.309
¶ I'm half crazy ¶

24:10.411 --> 24:13.946
¶ All for the love of you ¶

24:14.048 --> 24:16.248
¶ It won't be
a stylish marriage ¶

24:16.350 --> 24:17.333
WOMAN:
<i> Dump him.</i>

24:17.435 --> 24:20.336
¶ I can't afford a carriage ¶

24:20.438 --> 24:24.006
¶ But you'll look sweet
upon the seat ¶

24:24.108 --> 24:27.309
-¶ Of a bicycle built for two. ¶
-WOMAN:<i> Meow, meow, meow.</i>
