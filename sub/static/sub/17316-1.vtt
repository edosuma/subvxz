01:04.800 --> 01:06.154
Ah, good evening.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.117
I was just taking a little break.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.032
It's been a busy night.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.440
Lots of new arrivals.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.000
I call them the arriving departed.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.917
Ahh!
Well, back to work.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.553
Eh, what the hell.
One more for the road.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.519
Just a dash.
Adds a little spine.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.599
Long life.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.114
Ohh, better!

01:33.120 --> 01:35.589
Ahh, the doctor will see you now.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.236
Hmm.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.559
Uhh, ugly!

01:40.560 --> 01:42.756
Man, are you ugly.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.355
Well, we all know it isn't
what a person looks like.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.351
It's what's inside that counts.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.435
Mmm.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.232
Ehh, death by natural causes.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.796
Natural causes, natural causes.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.796
More natural causes.
I hate natural causes!

02:07.800 --> 02:10.952
Give me a big old stab wound
to poke around in, then I'm happy.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.634
Ahh, here we are.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.074
Body bags.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.720
See, if it's murder or suicide
or a nasty accident,

02:17.720 --> 02:19.757
they put 'em in these bags.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.400
This one was found
on a stretch of lonely highway,

02:22.400 --> 02:25.677
miles from the nearest town
on a pitch-black night.

02:33.720 --> 02:38.397
<i>Also in the news, another gruesome
murder in Haddonfield today.</i>

02:38.400 --> 02:40.915
<i>The body of a young woman
was discovered buried</i>

02:40.920 --> 02:43.310
<i>in the bottom of a trash bin
behind a shopping mall.</i>

02:43.320 --> 02:47.109
<i>Police Chief, Ardith Robinson
of the Haddonfield PD</i>

02:47.120 --> 02:49.760
<i>gave a statement
to reporters this afternoon</i>

02:49.760 --> 02:50.830
<i>after the discovery of"...</i>

02:53.480 --> 02:54.994
<i>Police believe the woman to be</i>

02:55.000 --> 02:58.436
<i>another victim of a serial killer
responsible for a series</i>

02:58.440 --> 03:01.035
<i>of ritualized slayings
in the southland.</i>

03:01.040 --> 03:02.952
<i>The body of the woman
was found by hikers--</i>

03:02.960 --> 03:06.556
I'd be scared shitless working
all alone in a place like this.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.597
Eh, I can take care of myself.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.957
Besides, you're the one who has
to drive back to an empty apartment.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.156
- Ooooh.
- Thanks a lot.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.231
You don't mind
picking me up in the morning?

03:16.240 --> 03:17.958
<i>- What time?
- Seven.</i>

03:17.960 --> 03:18.996
Ooh.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.117
This'll be the last time
I ask you for a ride, I promise.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.316
They said my car will be
out of the shop by tomorrow.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.437
I'll buy breakfast.

03:26.680 --> 03:27.716
Deal.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.234
See ya.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.312
<i>Can I help ya?</i>

03:41.320 --> 03:42.959
I'm Anne.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.075
Okay.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.117
The new girl.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.157
Oh, yeah, right,
come on in.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.349
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.317
- Sorry I'm late.
- No biggie.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.233
Oh, wow, this is almost identical
to the gas station I worked last month,

04:01.240 --> 04:02.754
except that was a little bit smaller.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.229
Well, why don't I give you
the, uh, the grand tour.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.880
Uh, that's the cash register.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.678
You just punch in the pump number
and amount, right?

04:09.680 --> 04:11.194
Yeah, you got it.
That's the credit card machine.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.236
No sweat.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.469
And listen, when you get
their, uh, signatures,

04:13.480 --> 04:15.119
make sure you get the license
plate number, all right?

04:15.120 --> 04:16.394
- Right.
- It's important.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.959
Um, the TV gets
maybe three channels.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.872
Actually, I'll probably just
do some studying.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.520
Um, the cigarette prices
are posted outside.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.670
- Saw it.
- Okay, good.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.875
Is that the bathroom?

04:25.880 --> 04:29.271
Well, actually, we, uh, prefer
to call that the employee's lounge.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.759
Yeah, great.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.672
Let's see-- oh, oh,
do I ring out the register

04:32.680 --> 04:34.194
when the morning shift
comes in?

04:34.200 --> 04:37.033
Nah, just, you know,
uh, he'll take care of that.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.635
Why don't you just collect
the cash and make change.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.791
- Okay.
- Yep-- oh, you know what?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.837
This door locks automatically
if you leave the booth.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.160
- So, uh--
- Keys?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.639
Right, keys, yeah, um--

04:46.640 --> 04:49.109
God, I don't know
where the hell I left them.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.679
Yeah, here they are.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.070
The round one,
um, that's for the booth

04:53.080 --> 04:54.719
and the square one
works everything else, okay?

04:54.720 --> 04:55.915
Got it.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.150
- Public restrooms.
- Yeah.

04:59.160 --> 05:03.154
Um... yeah, I guess
that's about it.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.915
You know, I feel a little bit guilty.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.752
Leaving you out here
all by yourself.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.797
- Eh, I'll be okay.
- Did you hear the news tonight?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.393
<i>- Yeah, it's horrible.
- Yeah.</i>

05:12.400 --> 05:14.039
- Hmm.
- Hey, you know what?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.997
If you got a problem,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.550
why don't you,
um, just give me a call, okay?

05:19.560 --> 05:20.710
<i>Hey, thank you.</i>

05:20.720 --> 05:21.870
<i>- Sure, no problem.
- Will do.</i>

05:21.880 --> 05:23.155
Okay.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.799
Uh, that's it, then.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.874
I'm outta here.
Have a good night.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.792
- See ya later.
- You got it.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.235
Pack of Coronados.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.238
Two seventy-five.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.795
Ls there anything else?

07:19.160 --> 07:21.277
Uh, what you readin'?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.794
It's for school.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.314
A college girl, huh?

07:26.920 --> 07:29.674
Yeah, well, I never got to go
to college myself, you know?

07:34.160 --> 07:36.038
Yeah, I got some bourbon
out in the car.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.396
Maybe I can get you
to come out of that booth.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.632
Maybe I'll see ya around.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.713
Okay.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.039
Okay.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.513
Hi, I need to fill her up.
Super unleaded.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.157
- Number 12?
- Uh, yeah.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.040
Haven't seen you
around here before.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.033
It's my first night-- huh.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.509
<i>Uh, signature
and license, please.</i>

10:02.200 --> 10:03.839
Are you from Haddonfield?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.114
Born and raised.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.114
Thanks.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.156
<i>What are you studying?</i>

10:13.360 --> 10:16.319
Um, psychology.
Final exams next week.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.959
<i>Gotta pull my average up.</i>

10:17.960 --> 10:20.680
- You go to the university?
- Uh-huh.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.512
Well, do you ever feel like,
uh, kicking back?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.318
You know, just hanging out
someplace after class?

10:25.440 --> 10:27.591
<i>- Sometimes.
- Well, you gotta try the Oak Lounge.</i>

10:27.600 --> 10:29.717
<i>It's, uh, down Seventh Street
by the freeway.</i>

10:29.720 --> 10:32.599
They got a really good band there
on weekends.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.992
Hey, maybe if I run into you some time,
I'll play you a game of pool.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.354
I'm no good at pool.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.396
All the better.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.955
Well, see ya.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.356
Bye.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.875
Ooh.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.675
Hey, you forgot your card!
Hey!

11:28.920 --> 11:30.274
Shit.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.632
Ooh!
Great.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.195
<i>Hey.</i>

12:18.200 --> 12:20.317
I need the key to the restroom.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.637
I really have to go
to the restroom.

12:25.640 --> 12:29.031
Oh, uh... the key's in the booth.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.040
<i>I have to get the other set.</i>

12:31.040 --> 12:32.758
Uh, I'll be right back.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.600
Shit.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.919
Ugh, thank God!

13:32.280 --> 13:33.919
Great.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.478
Oh, you pump,
I gotta go to the john.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.675
I'm gonna take care of this.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.559
Whoo-hoo, honey,
hiya, sweetheart!

14:47.560 --> 14:50.314
Listen, give me,
uh, oh, $20.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.152
Of that
superduper irregular

14:52.160 --> 14:55.631
on, uh, pump number
niner there, okay?

14:57.080 --> 14:59.356
You're a little glum tonight, hon,
what's wrong?

14:59.360 --> 15:00.839
You oughtta be out partyin'.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.752
<i>Pretty little thing
like you, huh?</i>

15:04.480 --> 15:08.440
Say, uh, I need a key to get
in that little boy's room there?

15:08.440 --> 15:09.874
Uh, you do.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.394
Listen, could you do me a favor?

15:12.240 --> 15:13.754
Sure, name it.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.150
There's a man,
he's in the men's restroom.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.390
- He's a little weird.
- Weirdo, huh?

15:18.400 --> 15:20.153
Yeah, I don't know--
I was wondering,

15:20.160 --> 15:21.753
could you take a look
and see what he's doing?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.354
You got that.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.633
Yoo-hoo!
There's nothing coming out.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.110
What's the problem?

15:39.120 --> 15:41.510
Oh, oh, there's nothing
coming out.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.752
<i>- You have to lift the lever.
- Oh.</i>

15:44.760 --> 15:47.195
No. The lever--
the lever on the pump.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.193
Never mind, I'll do it.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.199
<i>So sorry to bother you.</i>

16:02.200 --> 16:04.317
I just usually go
to the full serve.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.079
Oh.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.720
Oh, thanks.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.515
Guy is sleepin' in there.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.113
He's all curled up
around the toilet.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.919
I had to stand back
and aim over his head.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.911
Shame on you.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.196
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.999
I wouldn't worry about it, hon.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.878
He's fast asleep.
The guy's a bum.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.155
Let him sleep it off.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.435
Did you get the restroom key?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.397
Oh, I left it hangin'
in the door.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.040
Come on, baby, let's go,
I'm cold.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.872
See ya around, doll face.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.633
Get in there, get in there,
arrrh!

17:54.920 --> 17:56.274
God.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.318
<i>Shit!</i>

18:46.800 --> 18:48.029
I can do this.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.471
Come on, come on...

20:39.040 --> 20:40.235
Hi.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.200
This is Bill.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.316
I can't come
to the phone right now.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.715
So, maybe you could
just leave a message.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.280
See, I got a sore throat.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.113
<i>Be better if you could
call back.</i>

20:56.120 --> 20:59.716
If you wanna leave a message,
just wait for the beep.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.995
<i>Beep.</i>

21:27.840 --> 21:29.240
Come on, come on, come on.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.714
Come on!

21:35.400 --> 21:37.312
Answer the phone!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.315
- 9-1-1--
- Oh, there's a man!

21:43.320 --> 21:45.880
He's after me!
He's after me!

23:59.600 --> 24:01.079
Bitch.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.954
Oh!

26:00.000 --> 26:02.674
Die, you son of a bitch!

26:24.960 --> 26:26.474
Forgot my credit card.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.675
Tell me, how long have you had
these feelings of hostility?

26:47.560 --> 26:48.755
You can't say?

26:48.760 --> 26:52.435
You know, you really shouldn't keep
your emotions all bottled up inside.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.631
Eh, you're hopeless!

26:56.640 --> 26:58.040
He should have had a lobotomy.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.759
Let's go see what other fun things
we can find to do.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.276
Cirrhosis of the liver.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.634
Brain tumor.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.634
Severe head cold?

27:12.640 --> 27:15.030
Let's check the drawers.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.635
I call these
my necrophile cabinets.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.317
Seems to be stuck.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.399
Obviously,
these drawers were built

27:30.400 --> 27:33.313
before breast implants
became so popular.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.754
These oughtta be recycled.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.994
That's odd.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.635
Ooh.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.154
Marital spat?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.200
Kiss and make up.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.278
Ahh.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.554
Believe it or not,
this was a human body.

28:05.560 --> 28:09.031
Poor guy fell off a high-rise
onto the top of a car,

28:09.040 --> 28:10.838
which swerved in front
of a train

28:10.840 --> 28:13.753
and was dragged 900 yards
under the engine.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.150
Fascinating what can happen
to the human body

28:16.160 --> 28:17.674
under the right circumstances.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.749
<i>Tonight will be mostly clear</i>

28:32.760 --> 28:35.832
<i>but some low clouds late tonight
through midmorning tomorrow.</i>

28:35.840 --> 28:38.150
<i>Light winds,
lows in the upper 50s.</i>

28:38.160 --> 28:40.595
<i>High tomorrow
in the mid 70s.</i>

28:40.600 --> 28:42.114
<i>And now this--</i>

28:42.120 --> 28:44.476
<i>At the Roswell Hair Growth
Laboratories,</i>

28:44.480 --> 28:47.359
<i>we have perfected
a simple surgical procedure</i>

28:47.360 --> 28:51.559
<i>to restore full hair growth
virtually overnight.</i>

28:51.560 --> 28:54.280
<i>After my Roswell Hair
growth treatment,</i>

28:55.360 --> 28:57.113
<i>I bought the company.</i>

29:13.080 --> 29:14.833
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

29:17.080 --> 29:18.275
What's wrong?

29:19.080 --> 29:20.230
Nothing.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.475
Come on in.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.390
More wine?

29:32.400 --> 29:34.118
Mm, I'd love some.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.198
- Richard?
- Hm?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.190
What did you do to your hair?

29:48.960 --> 29:50.110
Nothing.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.155
Well, I mean,
I combed it a different way.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.880
Sweetheart, are you worried
about your hair thinning?

29:56.880 --> 29:59.270
No, of course not.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.239
I think you look
very distinguished.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.799
You're very handsome.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.189
You don't like it, do you?

30:09.200 --> 30:11.191
I like you.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.400
<i>Eat.</i>

30:18.000 --> 30:19.514
This veal is delicious, you know.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.159
So, you think I'm going bald?

30:24.160 --> 30:25.753
No, I don't.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.993
What's the big deal,
if you are anyway?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.753
Oh, so, now I am going bald?

30:30.760 --> 30:32.990
It really doesn't matter to me.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.435
Are you telling me
that you don't like hair?

30:35.440 --> 30:37.158
Of course, I like hair.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.753
Then how can you stand
looking at me?

30:39.920 --> 30:41.274
I mean, look at this.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.600
Look at that, huh?

30:42.600 --> 30:46.275
Richard,
you're behaving like a baby.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.431
Well, why not?
I got hair like a baby.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.159
Why don't you let me make
an appointment

31:09.160 --> 31:10.833
for you with my hairdresser?

31:10.840 --> 31:13.036
Dennis'll give your hair
a nice shape.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.758
I don't need shape.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.877
I need quantity.
I need volume.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.359
I need more hair.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.794
Now, what about this?

31:21.320 --> 31:23.118
- Huh?
- Forget it!

31:23.120 --> 31:24.998
- No way, no way!
- Wait, wait, wait, hey, hey!

31:25.000 --> 31:27.117
Come on,
just give it a chance.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.395
Take a look at it!

31:30.640 --> 31:32.950
- You mean--
- That looks ridiculous.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.316
- It won't fool anybody.
- Would you be careful with that?

31:40.680 --> 31:42.876
Oh, for God's sake, Richard.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.710
Okay.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.034
- Well, you see,
- Yeah.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.554
I don't think you'd ever know
it was a hairpiece.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.679
If you just take a little-- no.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.158
- No-oh-oh.
- What about there?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.958
- No?
- Wouldn't do it there.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.439
- Hey!
- God, no.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.510
Hey, wait a minute.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.715
- It's gotta go.
- What are you--

31:59.720 --> 32:01.154
Come on, man, I need that,
I need that back.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.436
Richard, you're in denial.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.638
It makes you look like
the world's biggest jerk off.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.279
It makes me look like
I've got more hair.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.350
Sit down, Rich--

32:11.320 --> 32:12.834
I need that back.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.035
Fine.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.236
Let me just tell you
how things are, okay, Richard?

32:16.240 --> 32:18.231
You're headin' for egg city.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.597
Located in the chrome dome county
in the state of the cue ball.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.795
Do you understand what
I'm talking about?

32:22.800 --> 32:27.590
In a year, your head will look
like a Christmas tree lot in January.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.435
I understand that.
That's why I need your help.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.113
Have you got some kind
of a thickening agent?

32:33.120 --> 32:35.760
Something I can put in there
and give me a little bit more,

32:35.760 --> 32:37.672
you know, volume, huh?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.592
I can help you, Richard.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.954
How?

32:40.960 --> 32:42.599
Only if you let me.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.875
- Of course.
- Okay.

32:43.880 --> 32:44.916
Now, what I can do--

32:47.600 --> 32:48.920
I can cut your hair.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.877
I can give it shape.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.873
- I can give it style, Richard.
- Come on.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.236
Now, I can empower you, Richard.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.391
<i>- Give you back your manhood.
- I can't let you cut my hair.</i>

32:58.400 --> 33:00.915
<i>- It's your birthright.
- What are you going to cut?</i>

33:00.920 --> 33:04.755
Please, let me just
style it a little bit.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.080
What I do is, see--

33:06.080 --> 33:08.879
I start from--
We start from here.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.280
No cutting, no cutting.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.919
Fine, just styling.

34:34.320 --> 34:38.030
<i>Just as plants
respond to soothing music,</i>

34:38.040 --> 34:41.750
<i>your follicles will love
Harmonies for Hair.</i>

34:52.920 --> 34:54.991
Grow, baby, grow.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.350
Hi!

35:32.160 --> 35:34.436
I really like your hair like that,
it looks nice.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.510
How about a drink?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.553
Did Dennis do that?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.392
Do what?

35:45.400 --> 35:47.471
Paint your head.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.756
Who painted your head?

35:49.760 --> 35:51.911
Doesn't work?

35:51.920 --> 35:53.752
Dennis didn't do that, did he?

35:53.760 --> 35:55.672
Tell me he didn't do that.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.716
No, I did it.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.115
You don't like it, do you?

36:05.960 --> 36:08.111
<i>Poor baby.</i>

36:08.120 --> 36:10.680
All this is really gettin'
to you, isn't it?

36:10.680 --> 36:12.671
Oh, it's driving me crazy, Megan.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.512
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.511
The only thing
I can think about is my hair.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.920
I'm losing my hair.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.399
Oh, darling.

36:22.360 --> 36:25.273
It wouldn't be so--

36:25.280 --> 36:26.714
What?

36:26.720 --> 36:30.680
You-- you've got stuff
all over your face.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.955
Oh!

36:47.760 --> 36:50.150
Look at all this crap.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.151
I disgust you, don't I?

36:52.160 --> 36:54.675
What disgusts me, Richard,
is your inability

36:54.680 --> 36:56.239
to accept yourself
as you are.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.994
I just don't want
to be a bald guy.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.639
You're not a bald guy.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.519
You-- you're just--
you're just a thinning hair guy.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.715
It means the same thing.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.280
It doesn't mean
the same thing, okay?

37:07.280 --> 37:08.316
What it--

37:09.560 --> 37:12.234
I just can't deal with you
when you're like this, okay?

37:12.240 --> 37:14.277
- Megan.
- Bye.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.509
Megan.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.559
Megan, please.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.310
I think we need to spend some time
away from each other.

37:27.320 --> 37:31.553
Oh, sure, just walk out
on the bald guy.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.871
Do yourself a favor, Richard,
wash your head.

37:40.720 --> 37:44.509
<i>Miracle Shine, the miracle shampoo.</i>

37:44.520 --> 37:48.673
<i>Miracle Shine will add
new fullness of life to your hair.</i>

37:48.680 --> 37:52.355
<i>That youthful luster is what
all other shampoo products</i>

37:52.360 --> 37:55.512
<i>have claimed to achieve,
but never really delivered.</i>

37:55.520 --> 37:59.309
<i>Miracle Shine, the miracle shampoo.
Add new--</i>

37:59.320 --> 38:02.995
<i>With Colossal Grow
your lawn will never be thicker.</i>

38:03.000 --> 38:06.072
<i>Professional gardeners are buying
Colossal Grow and doubling their--</i>

38:06.080 --> 38:07.798
<i>The Roswell Hair Growth
Laboratories'</i>

38:07.800 --> 38:10.793
<i>patented technique
is guaranteed.</i>

38:10.800 --> 38:13.030
<i>No painful and iffy transplants.</i>

38:13.040 --> 38:15.509
<i>No silly toupees or weaves.</i>

38:15.520 --> 38:18.035
<i>Just a full head
of beautiful, living hair.</i>

38:18.680 --> 38:20.990
<i>Call now for an immediate
appointment.</i>

38:21.000 --> 38:23.071
<i>Operators are standing by
24 hours a day.</i>

38:23.080 --> 38:26.312
<i>Remember, after my Roswell
hair growth procedure,</i>

38:26.320 --> 38:28.038
<i>I bought the company.</i>

38:28.800 --> 38:30.712
5-5-5-9-9-1-1.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.629
Yes.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.599
<i>Mr. Richard
Coberts is here for his appointment.</i>

38:40.600 --> 38:42.114
Show him in, please.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.198
- Nice to meet you, Richard.
- Doctor.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.590
Mr. Coberts' before picture.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.034
Have a seat, please.

39:01.480 --> 39:05.110
I take it my nurses
fully explained our procedure.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.716
Uh, yes, I saw your commercial
on television.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.756
How does it work?

39:09.760 --> 39:12.719
We revive dead hair follicles

39:12.720 --> 39:15.519
by applying
a protein-based solution

39:15.520 --> 39:18.797
to the hair roots
beneath the scalp.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.393
What's in the protein solution?

39:20.400 --> 39:21.959
That's patented.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.634
I love it when he talks that way.

39:24.640 --> 39:28.236
Don't you think he'll look just
too sexy with a full head of hair?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.470
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.915
Richard might not be right
for our treatment.

39:35.080 --> 39:38.471
Tell me, why do you want hair?

39:44.440 --> 39:47.194
Uh, I think I'll feel better
about myself.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.989
There are certain advantages
to being bald, Richard.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.832
For instance,

39:52.840 --> 39:56.515
Bald men are often considered to be
more trustworthy, less threatening.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.798
<i>The primal power that a full head
of hair bestows on a man</i>

40:00.800 --> 40:03.076
<i>brings a certain pressure
to perform.</i>

40:04.040 --> 40:06.555
Some men realize that
they prefer to remain

40:06.560 --> 40:08.836
out of the limelight.

40:08.840 --> 40:13.357
Well, that may be so, Doctor,
but I want hair.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.919
I want lots of hair.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.594
You don't think
I'm up to it, do you?

40:24.520 --> 40:27.592
- Are you?
- I think so.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.591
I think so too.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.830
<i>It'll change your life, Richard.</i>

40:31.840 --> 40:33.069
I want it to change.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.838
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

40:36.840 --> 40:40.038
I love a positive man.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.633
Very well.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.196
Nurse, activate the compuscan.

40:45.200 --> 40:49.080
I'll just insert your picture

40:49.080 --> 40:51.470
into the graphic scanner.

40:52.200 --> 40:56.194
And... voila.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.433
Now, we, uh, have
quite a few hair personalities

41:00.440 --> 41:02.352
for you to choose from,

41:02.360 --> 41:05.193
uh, depending on which trait
you wish to emphasize.

41:07.480 --> 41:10.473
This is your basic
conservative look.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.597
We call it Traditional Republican.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.716
- I don't know, eh...
- I agree.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.313
No?

41:17.320 --> 41:19.550
Well, uh, go a little bit more daring.

41:19.560 --> 41:24.635
The Military Style, favored
by police, soldiers, athletes.

41:24.640 --> 41:28.156
- I don't know, it's almost too, uh--
- Drab.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.719
Exactly.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.916
You see, I want something
that is very, um,

41:32.480 --> 41:33.800
- exciting.
- Yes.

41:33.800 --> 41:34.836
- Bold.
- Yes.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.718
- Sexy.
- Yes, yes.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.434
Let's try this.

41:44.320 --> 41:47.438
We call this our Stallion Look.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.633
Giddyup.

41:49.640 --> 41:54.635
Yes, that's it, that's the one.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.916
The Stallion Look it is.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.991
Congratulations, Richard.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.115
Uh, no surgery.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.634
No, no, no,
heavens no, no.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.358
We apply the solution here

42:04.360 --> 42:07.478
then when you wake up
tomorrow morning in your own bed,

42:07.480 --> 42:11.155
you take off the bandage
and you're a new man.

43:18.440 --> 43:22.275
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
please let me have hair.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.471
If I have hair,
I have everything.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.474
I just want to love me again.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.232
I don't love me
the way I am now.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.271
I love me the way
I used to be.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.192
The way I want to be.

43:39.200 --> 43:42.477
Please, God,
just let me have--

43:50.640 --> 43:52.472
Hair.

43:52.480 --> 43:55.040
Oh, my... oh, my God.

44:10.680 --> 44:13.240
I have-- I-- it's hair.

44:13.240 --> 44:14.560
I have hair!

44:15.600 --> 44:20.117
It worked.
Oh, God, look at tha--

44:23.320 --> 44:25.471
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.437
Thank you, thank you.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.114
It's the old me.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.080
It's the new me.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.435
It's the me
I've always wanted to be.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.275
No, no, no.

44:45.280 --> 44:47.715
I can't let you touch it.

44:47.720 --> 44:50.474
If I let you touch it, I'll have to let
everybody else touch it.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.394
Yes, yes, it is the source
of all my strength.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.113
But it's not the only source.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.997
See that my men are well fed.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.038
And bring forth the women.

45:11.800 --> 45:14.918
It's incredible!

45:14.920 --> 45:17.515
Who is this Dr. Lock?

45:17.520 --> 45:19.876
He advertises on TV.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.031
Why doesn't everybody
go to him?

45:22.040 --> 45:23.394
He's new.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.630
It's amazing.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.599
I can't believe
what it's done for you.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.195
Ohh, mm-mm.

45:38.680 --> 45:40.433
You even kiss better.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.513
I know I said it didn't matter,

45:43.520 --> 45:47.150
but you look so fantastic
with this new hair.

45:47.160 --> 45:50.039
You're just so-- You're so--

45:50.040 --> 45:54.591
You're so animal.

45:58.040 --> 46:00.509
Tell me you love me, Richard.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.999
Just me.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.350
- Mm-mm.
- Morning, lover.

46:25.360 --> 46:27.511
Morning.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.160
Oh.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.591
Oh.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.557
Feel like I'm getting
a sore throat.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.711
Maybe you overdid it
last night, huh?

46:36.720 --> 46:38.871
Oh, I got this tickle
in my throat.

46:38.880 --> 46:42.919
Well, I'd love to stay
and scratch it, but I gotta go.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.120
See you later, sexy?

46:47.080 --> 46:48.673
Take care of that sore throat,
you hear?

46:50.040 --> 46:51.872
You gotta save all
your strength for me.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.831
- I don't believe it.
- I don't either.

47:38.480 --> 47:42.110
You know, this is--
it's amazing.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.998
I know.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.196
And it's not a weave.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.520
No, no, it's all mine, baby.

47:47.520 --> 47:51.434
Oh, man, it seems
so good and healthy.

47:51.440 --> 47:53.636
You know what I mean?

47:53.640 --> 47:55.711
Oh, man, all right, okay.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.315
- Who is this Dr. Lock, huh?
- He's new.

47:59.720 --> 48:02.713
- You look... great.
- I know.

48:02.720 --> 48:04.473
You look great.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.193
Now, I'm just going
to cut it a little bit, okay?

48:12.240 --> 48:13.879
Just give it a little bit of shape.

48:13.880 --> 48:15.155
You all right there, buddy?

48:15.160 --> 48:16.196
Not too much, not too much.

48:16.200 --> 48:18.760
No, no, no, just styled.
Just style.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.595
Hello.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.509
Lousy.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.198
I don't know,
I just don't feel too good.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.356
Huh?
Um, gettin' a haircut.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.279
Yeah, well, after you left
this morning,

48:44.280 --> 48:47.637
I discovered that my hair's grown
nearly six inches.

48:47.640 --> 48:48.869
No, I'm not kidding.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.394
I know, it's weird.

48:52.360 --> 48:53.794
Listen, I'm glad you called.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.998
Um, I'm gonna have
to cancel our date tonight.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.912
I really think I'm coming down
with something.

49:00.760 --> 49:02.672
No, I am not seeing
somebody else.

49:02.680 --> 49:04.398
Come on, Megan,
what's the matter with you?

49:06.120 --> 49:07.599
Okay.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.079
Yeah, yeah.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.594
That's all right.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.796
Yep, thanks.

49:12.800 --> 49:14.075
Bye-bye.

49:25.680 --> 49:27.671
Ahh, ah.

49:34.120 --> 49:36.555
Ahh, ahhh.

50:15.880 --> 50:18.349
Oh, no, oh.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.277
Hello.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.112
Not so good.

50:50.120 --> 50:51.520
What time is it?

50:54.320 --> 50:56.232
What?

50:56.240 --> 50:58.311
No, nobody else is here.

50:58.320 --> 51:01.199
Why don't you believe me.
I told you I'm sick.

51:01.200 --> 51:04.591
It's not an act.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.553
What?

51:07.560 --> 51:09.711
Oh, fine, suit yourself,
don't believe me then!

52:54.240 --> 52:56.436
- Happy, darling?
- Yes, of course.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.598
Ah, Richard, how are you?

53:02.600 --> 53:03.795
Guess.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.314
You look great.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.471
Another successful operation.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.120
What are you talking about?
Look what's happening to me.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.271
I know, isn't it wonderful.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.271
Let me show you something.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.871
<i>You earthlings and your vanity.</i>

53:29.880 --> 53:32.236
You're so predictably easy.

53:34.240 --> 53:36.277
You know, at first,
it was difficult.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.479
<i>When we arrived on this planet,
we were tiny, starving organisms.</i>

53:40.480 --> 53:43.916
And then we discovered
that your brains

53:43.920 --> 53:47.152
are the only food
on which we can thrive.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.314
<i>The questions was one of access.</i>

53:53.000 --> 53:55.230
We seem to have found
the answer.

54:04.640 --> 54:09.351
In fact, we're particularly
enjoying your brain.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.913
We like fat.

54:14.840 --> 54:18.720
Nurse, transfer Richard
into implant containers.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.438
Then call in the next patient.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.189
Ooh.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.634
It seems to me, maybe I'm going
a little thin on top myself.

55:21.640 --> 55:22.915
Ooh!

55:22.920 --> 55:25.389
I think we have time
for one more body.

55:25.400 --> 55:27.357
Does anyone
have anything to share?

55:30.720 --> 55:32.040
No volunteers?

55:33.360 --> 55:35.716
What a bunch of stiffs!

55:35.720 --> 55:38.553
I want you guys to think about this
while I go have a drink.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.354
Ehh!

55:46.000 --> 55:48.435
Ooh, I forgot about this.

55:50.320 --> 55:51.834
This is weird.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.632
This may make you
a little tense.

55:59.960 --> 56:03.271
It made someone a little past tense.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

56:04.400 --> 56:06.198
Here's looking at you, kid.

56:13.960 --> 56:15.678
<i>Bice is hoping Matthews</i>

56:15.680 --> 56:18.195
<i>can get something going here.</i>

56:18.200 --> 56:19.395
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

56:20.120 --> 56:22.840
<i>Good hit. Go.</i>

56:22.840 --> 56:24.831
<i>Get over that fence.</i>

56:24.840 --> 56:26.115
Yeah!

56:28.120 --> 56:29.998
What's going on, Matthews?

56:30.000 --> 56:32.515
All of a sudden you're knockin'
the hell outta that ball.

56:32.520 --> 56:34.796
Yeah, I don't know,
I'm seein' it real good.

56:34.800 --> 56:37.554
I don't want to make you nervous,
but the Giants got their eye on you.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.233
Yeah, I heard that one before.

56:39.240 --> 56:41.118
Hey, they could use
a good pinch hitter this year.

56:42.480 --> 56:44.949
Still gonna talk to us peons
when you hit the majors?

56:44.960 --> 56:46.030
Yeah, right.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.872
I'm not about to start counting
my chickens.

56:47.880 --> 56:49.394
I've been too close
too many times.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.800
Somethin' always happens.

56:50.800 --> 56:53.030
I got a feeling
this is your year.

56:53.040 --> 56:55.509
Let's say we knock back
a few brews and celebrate.

56:55.520 --> 56:58.752
I don't think so, bud. I got someone
prettier to celebrate with.

56:59.760 --> 57:00.830
You better watch it.

57:00.840 --> 57:03.116
It ain't natural to love
your wife so much.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.753
Hello.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.955
Hey, darlin'.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.075
<i>How'd you do?</i>

57:22.080 --> 57:24.754
Three for four and a homerun
to win it in the ninth.

57:24.760 --> 57:27.400
Oh, that's great.

57:27.400 --> 57:29.153
I've got some good news too.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.675
<i>- What?
- Surprise.</i>

57:31.680 --> 57:33.433
- Tell me.
- Unh-uh.

57:33.440 --> 57:34.919
You gotta come home
to find out.

57:36.160 --> 57:38.516
I'll be there in a flash.
Love ya.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.352
I love you too.
Bye.

59:27.440 --> 59:29.955
Jesus Christ!

59:35.560 --> 59:36.835
Ah!

59:51.680 --> 59:53.876
<i>Brent?</i>

59:53.880 --> 59:55.234
You're gonna be okay.

59:56.120 --> 59:58.715
Honey, Dr. Bregman is here

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.916
and he needs to talk to you.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.479
Are you feeling up to it?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.150
Good morning, Brent.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.592
Now, let me guess, Doc.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.237
Heh, I got a concussion and--

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.393
Yeah, your putting me
on the three-day disabled list.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.234
Brent, I'm sorry to tell you this,

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.278
but it's much worse than that.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.398
<i>I'm afraid you've lost
your right eye.</i>

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.470
But I'm a baseball player.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.358
It's the eye I use...

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.397
to see the God damn ball.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.993
Oh, Honey.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.275
No!

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.750
<i>Dr. Watkins, Dr. Watkins.</i>

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.110
Brent.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.599
This is Dr. Lang.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.079
He'd like to speak with you.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.630
What about?

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.637
I think maybe I can help you.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.112
<i>I've spent the last ten years
of my life developing a method</i>

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.953
<i>to transplant an entire eye.</i>

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.395
<i>Now, it's never been done
or even tried.</i>

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.677
But I do think it could work.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.833
Unfortunately, I'm pretty much alone
in that opinion.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.070
Let's say I'm skeptical.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.479
I could play again?

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.313
<i>Yeah, if it works.</i>

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.515
Well, what if it doesn't?

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.395
Well, if the eye dies,
we'll just have to remove it

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.437
and you and I are back
to square one.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.560
When can we do it?

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.710
Well, I'd prefer
to do it right away.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.077
I-- I just received
a healthy donor eye.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.720
Oh, I-- I know that sounds
a bit gruesome.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.236
But, uh, it's an excellent match
for your size.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.840
It is a brown eye, but we can use
a contact lens to match your color.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.835
Talk it over with your wife

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.433
and we'll chat tomorrow.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.711
<i>The eye from a dead person?</i>

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.432
I guess it would have to be.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.431
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.238
I know, it's weird, isn't it?

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.676
Oh boy, you think
about God's will.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.956
- Is this God's will?
- Well, isn't it?

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.194
I don't know.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.593
Well, he gave us the ability
to think and make discoveries.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.638
You know what I mean.
You know, science and everything.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.711
If it's for the good.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.679
Well, what's not good about me
being able to have a career

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.195
and a family?

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.719
<i>- Darling?
- What?</i>

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.477
Nothing.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.949
Brent, you're right.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.555
<i>- Of course, we should try it.
- Sure.</i>

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.519
And if it doesn't work, babe,
it just-- it doesn't work.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.360
<i>And Saul arose from the Earth.</i>

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.150
<i>And when his eyes were opened
he saw no man.</i>

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.072
<i>They brought him into Damascus</i>

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.278
<i>where there was a certain disciple
named Ananias.</i>

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.193
<i>And to him
said the Lord in a vision,</i>

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.672
<i>"Ananias, arise and inquire
in the house of Judas</i>

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.592
<i>for one cold soul."</i>

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.639
For I will show him
how many things he must suffer

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.870
for my name's sake.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.954
And Ananias went his way
and entered into the house.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.600
And laying his hands
on him said,

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.559
"Brother Saul,
the Lord Jesus,

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.870
who appeared to you
on the road as you came,

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.113
<i>has sent me
that you may receive your sight</i>

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.158
<i>and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</i>

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.553
<i>Immediately, there fell from his eyes
something like scales.</i>

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.359
<i>And he received his sight
at once.</i>

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.035
<i>And he arose and was baptized.</i>

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.389
<i>Mrs. Matthews?</i>

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.234
Mrs. Matthews?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.236
Yes.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.233
The operation
went smooth as silk.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.756
<i>Brent's in recovery
and should awaken at any moment.</i>

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.234
I'm putting a patch
over the left eye.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.159
Now, are we ready?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.913
Ready.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.436
Well, if everything
works out all right,

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.275
your vision should only be blurry
for a few days.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.557
All right, now.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.994
Here we go.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.549
I like your hair
tied back that way.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.960
Congratulations.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.073
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.720
<i>Strike one,
slider down and inside.</i>

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.600
Hi, I made them let me off work
an hour early.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.071
What's wrong, sweetie,
another headache?

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.309
Yeah.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.470
The doctor said the headaches
will go away soon.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.030
And tomorrow you get your blue lens
and it's home sweet home.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.319
You don't have to turn it off.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.516
Yeah, it's just--
I can't watch it.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.999
It should be me up there.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.560
It will be, baby, it will be.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.469
What is it?

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.674
Uh, nothin'.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.234
Everything's gonna be okay.
I promise.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.912
The headaches should diminish
little by little.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.075
Now, it's important that you do
the eye exercises I gave you.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.040
Now, let's, uh-- let's try this
to see how this lens fits.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.275
- Honey, it looks great.
- Yeah?

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.634
Yeah.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.518
Well, Brent, I'm gonna send
you home tomorrow.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.591
Now, remember--

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.830
<i>It's going to take
at least six weeks</i>

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.991
<i>for this surgery
to heal completely.</i>

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.310
Ls there anything
he shouldn't do?

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.357
Oh, light exercise, fine.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.680
But nothing strenuous.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.433
And I want to see you
in a few days, okay?

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.840
Thanks, Doc.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.676
Oh, man.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.990
It's great to be home.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.072
Since you're in such a good mood,
I think we should celebrate.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.559
- Yeah.
- I'll give you my surprise, hm?

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.960
Surprise?

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.430
<i>- What are you up to?
- You'll see.</i>

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.358
- Ready?
- I guess.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.669
<i>♪ Ta-da. ♪</i>

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.200
Oh.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.120
What's this?

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.589
It's a present, dummy.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.750
For me?

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.314
To Dad from Mom.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.718
You're gonna have a baby?

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.359
We're gonna have a baby.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.840
Aren't you happy?

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.471
Oh, yeah.

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:45.993
You don't look very happy.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.750
I am.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.639
I am.
Darlin', I think it's fantastic.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.837
<i>Brent, you're worried
about the future, aren't you?</i>

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.154
I don't know.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.600
Maybe a little.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.591
You know, whatever happens,
it'll be okay.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.749
Sure.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.279
Aren't you gonna open it?

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.678
What am I doin'?

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.996
Okay, let's see.

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:29.919
A crib?

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.718
I thought this was
a present for me.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.871
It is.
You get to put it together.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.157
I get it, I get it.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.550
- Did you put your drops in?
- Yeah.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.880
Is the blur almost gone?

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.633
Oh, it's pretty clear.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.868
Does your head still hurt?

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.639
Oh, it's just once in a while.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.872
I suppose I'm gonna have
to get used to this new part of you.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.160
Hey, I'm not the only one
with new parts around here.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.993
Ain't it somethin'?
Five weeks old.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.791
Just think, eight months
from now it'll be opening day.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.196
Wouldn't it be great.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.795
I'd tear up the league
in Spring training.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.314
The majors pick me up.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.153
The baby's born on opening day
and I celebrate

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.392
by comin' off the bench in the ninth
and swattin' one over the fence.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.720
Wouldn't that be great?

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.632
It'd be great.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.033
You look so pretty.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.711
Oh, are we not supposed
to have sex?

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.279
Oh, no, we can have sex.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.636
I just think
we should wait a little.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.916
Until you heal better.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.435
The doctor didn't say
anything about that.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.909
<i>Well, maybe tomorrow,
sweetie, okay?</i>

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.073
It's just-- I'm not feeling, well--
you know.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.198
I love you, Brent,
I'm just not in a sexy mood.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.753
Would it help
if I put my lens in?

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.150
<i>Is that what's bothering you?</i>

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.833
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.399
I'm sure I'll get used
to you without it,

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.598
but at the moment it's...

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.000
I don't know.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.356
<i>It's a little strange.</i>

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.478
No big deal.
The kid aims to please.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.549
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.872
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.110
- I'm really sorry.
- Mmm.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.157
Come, let's go to bed.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.876
Oh, honey, the shutters.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.951
Oh, jeez.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.356
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.230
Brent, what is it?

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.800
<i>- A headache.
- Oh, come on, baby.</i>

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.234
- Oh!
- Lie down.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.993
Okay?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.229
Gently, gently.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.720
Easy.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.599
- Ohh.
- Is that better?

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.910
Yeah, I think so.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.434
I think it's goin' away.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.911
A little too much excitement
on the first night, huh?

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:00.311
Yeah, you may be right.
Oh, that feels good.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.440
Let's just go to sleep, hmm?

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.638
- Yeah, oh, just keep doin' that.
- Okay.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.357
<i>Honey, breakfast.</i>

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.994
- Did you do your eye exercises?
- Mm-hm.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.957
Listen, I have to get to work.
Are you okay?

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.110
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.600
If you feel like it, why don't you take
a crack at putting the crib together?

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.195
Because I got the back yard
to work on! Okay?

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.191
You don't have to yell.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.274
Did I?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.839
I'm sorry.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.112
Our baby will hear you.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.356
There's my ride.
Bye.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.680
- Mm.
- See ya.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.440
No!

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.152
Make a joyful noise
unto the Lord, all ye lands.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.117
Know ye that
the Lord he is God.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.514
Brent?

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.670
Brent?

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.034
Hey, darlin'.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.111
Come on up.
Got something to show ya.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.278
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.473
- Hi, sweetie.
- Mm.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.550
You're in a good mood.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.074
- Well, feelin' better, come on.
- Good.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.150
Oh.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.480
My handyman.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.119
Yeah, it's pretty nifty, huh?

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.874
What about the sides?

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.758
I was about to do that.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.640
There.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.799
There.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.912
Jesus Christ!

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.199
You took your diapers
off again.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.635
Look at this mess.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.030
You make everything so hard
for me, you--

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.957
What is it, what's wrong?

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.112
Oh, oh, Brent,
honey, what's the matter?

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.474
Oh, my God!

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.790
Well, can't he be reached
at home?

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.440
I don't care where he is,
I just need to talk to him.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.552
No, no, no, it's my husband.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.996
Well, I don't know,
it's an emergency.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.833
Uh, he's not dying,
if that's what you mean.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.558
Hey, I'm feelin' a little better.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.358
Oh, hold on a moment, please.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.352
Oh, I don't know, you look so--

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.192
I mean, I really think
you should see someone.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.112
Oh, no, I really am feelin' better.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.316
Just tell 'em
I'll call him tomorrow.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.960
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.599
Hello?

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.991
No, no, don't bother,
we'll call him in the morning.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.229
Thank you.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.358
Mm, I'm feeling much better.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.829
Do you know what would
make me feel better still?

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.718
<i>- Brent.
- What?</i>

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:43.150
Look what you did, you bit me.
I'm bleeding.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.635
Ohh--.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.873
I see things.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.394
What things?

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.357
Just, leave me alone.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.839
Leave me alone!

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.394
<i>He gnashes upon me with his eye.</i>

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.030
<i>Mine enemy sharpened
his eyes upon me.</i>

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.351
<i>They have gaped upon me
with his mouth.</i>

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.239
They have gathered themselves
together against me.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.234
God hath delivered me
to the ungodly

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.756
and turned me over
into the hands of the wicked.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.990
He hath also
taken me by my neck

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.029
<i>and shaken me to pieces
and set me up for his mark.</i>

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.476
<i>His archers compass me
roundabout.</i>

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.599
<i>He cleaveth my reins asunder
and doth not spare.</i>

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.071
<i>He poureth out my gall
upon the ground.</i>

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.471
<i>He breaketh me
with breach upon breach.</i>

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.154
<i>He runneth upon me
like a giant.</i>

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.039
<i>I have sewed sackcloth
upon my skin</i>

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.794
<i>and defiled my horn
in the dust.</i>

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.030
<i>My face is foul
with weeping</i>

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.033
<i>and on my eyelids
is the shadow of death.</i>

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.872
<i>Therefore rejoice...</i>

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.711
The sky were darkened
by the smoke from the abyss.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.710
I told you to leave me alone!

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.634
Why can't you do
what I ask you to do?

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.511
Please, Brent,
go see the doctor.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.399
Yes, will he help?
Will he help me?

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.835
Will the doctor help me?

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.035
I'll drive you.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.077
No, the keys.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.514
Where are the keys?

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.557
<i>Downstairs on the table.</i>

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.959
What have you done to me?

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.749
Oh, uh, Brent, aren't I supposed
to see you this afternoon?

01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.910
What have you done to me?

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.552
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.119
What's happenin' to me?

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.680
Are you outta your mind?
Calm down.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.320
This eye, this eye!

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.438
Where in the hell
did this eye come from?

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.992
Wh-- wh-- wh--
what does it matter?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.150
Tell me!

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.632
Well, it, uh, from a man--
a man who died.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.790
How did he die?

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.231
He-- he was executed.
He died in the gas chamber.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.953
Well, who was he?

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.360
Tell me!

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.955
Uh, Randall-- John Randall.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.911
Here we are--
John Randall.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.799
Just move this
and it scans the entire text.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.553
Let me know
if you need anymore help.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:15.197
Apparently,
Randall had attempted

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.160
to get rid of the bodies
in his kitchen garbage disposal.

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:25.356
Ultimately, the dismembered remains
of seven young women

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.990
were discovered
in shallow graves.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.596
All the victims had died
as a result of stab wounds

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.479
administered by a pair
of garden shears.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:41.671
Each of the women
had been sexually molested

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.633
after death.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.116
Subsequent investigation
into Randall's past

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.750
uncovered a childhood
marked by physical abuse

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.357
at the hands of an...
alcoholic mother.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.351
Police were struck
by the fact that

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.115
Randall's mother, like all the victims,
had blonde hair.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.120
In conversations with police,

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.589
Randall referred to himself as...

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.438
the Devil.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.989
Brent?

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.557
Brent?

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.114
I'm out here.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.479
What did the doctor say?

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.870
Oh, nothin' to worry about.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:01.029
Could you please stop diggin'.
I need to talk to you.

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.915
I can't.

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.233
I have to finish
diggin' your grave.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.917
Whore!

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.429
What are you doing?
No, get off me!

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.197
Get off me!

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.194
This is the John Randall, dear.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.793
He chose them by their hair!

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:37.998
John Randall.
John Randall.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.789
John Randall, John Randall,
John Randall, John Randall!

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:45.111
Randall, Randall,
John Randall.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.589
He cut 'em up, you see?

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.430
John woulda liked you.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.397
I have his eye, you know.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.551
I see what John Randall saw.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.556
And it's so damn satisfying.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.520
<i>Brent, the bible,
look at the bible.</i>

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.716
He makes 'em soft.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.680
They're hair is soft, but it-
They're whores!

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.271
So, we have to make 'em soft.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.271
And then we can have 'em.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.273
But then they get cold and, uh--

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.718
Oh, John, he doesn't like that.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.315
Grind 'em up.
That's what we do.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.755
But they're too big.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.877
Big and ugly.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.200
And so we dig.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.874
Put 'em in the ground
and make 'em quiet.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.079
Oh, John, he knew
what was good.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.152
Brent, the bible,
look at the bible.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.319
What is in the bible?

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.870
- John Randall's in the bible.
- John Randall's not in the bible!

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.792
That Brent, Brent's in the bible!

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.279
That's right, Brent's in the bible.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.915
No, I-- I-- I mean that--

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.231
That's right, you said
Brent's in the bible.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.679
No, that's not what I mean.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.116
Yes, look, it says it
in the bible.

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.709
<i>From Cathy to Brent,
our faith in thee.</i>

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.151
Shut up!
Whore!

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.311
No.

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.880
To Brent from Cathy,

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.316
may we always
walk together with God.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.838
<i>♪ I got my eye on you baby ♪</i>

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.877
<i>♪ Oh yeah. ♪</i>

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.998
Oh, sorry, I couldn't resist.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.479
So, what do you think?

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.313
Myself, I love stories
about our national pastime--

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.152
violent death.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.840
Ooh.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.831
What I don't understand is,

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.639
why was he so upset
about losing his eye?

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.677
You could have become
an umpire.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.391
Uh-oh, better get movin'.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.034
Oh!

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.430
Oohoo,
it's freezin' in here.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.794
Mighty-night.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.915
Oh, man it looks like we got
our work cut out for us tonight.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.513
Man, you ain't lyin'.

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.715
Might as well get started.

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.674
Another John Doe, huh?

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.434
Ooh, severe, uh, trauma
to the abdomen, I'd say.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.113
Really, what's your first clue?

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.555
Here, give me that saw.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.871
Ooh, hey, I'm gonna get
some coffee, man.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.871
- Hey, get me some too, buddy.
- You bet.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.354
You know,
these guys crack me up.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:00.000
You gotta love 'em.
Oop, gotta run.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.189
That's not good.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.630
Well, look at your liver, buddy.

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.519
What the hell you been drinkin',
formaldehyde?

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.476
How's it coming?

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.280
Give me the head saw.
