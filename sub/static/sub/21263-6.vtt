What are you wearing this weekend?
Dashiell, get your shoes on.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.233
It's black tie optional
but I'm sure everybody's wearing a suit.

00:25.316 --> 00:26.234
What wedding?

00:26.317 --> 00:28.236
Rich Colgan, my friend from college.

00:28.319 --> 00:32.574
I can't. It's parents weekend at Groton.
If I don't go, Linda'll throw a shit fit.

00:32.657 --> 00:35.368
-Daddy, bad word!
-I know.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.370
I wish you would have told me earlier.

you know? Dance? Nice night together?

-[Pearl] I can go.
-You cannot go.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.170
Having a nice weekend.
None of this.

00:45.253 --> 00:48.757
I know. I'll make it up to you
at your party. Or after your party.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.135
Oh! Crash landing! It's all yours, pal.

-That's a 60-foot wave.
-I can't stop watching this.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.444
When he gets here, don't man-crush him
so hard, okay? Just be cool.

01:09.527 --> 01:12.322
-Because when you're uncool, I'm uncool.
-What?

01:12.947 --> 01:14.240
[Ethan] Tag!

01:14.324 --> 01:17.410

-How was your flight?

01:19.329 --> 01:21.581
-Wow!
-It was great. Massive turbulence.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.584
-It was awesome. I was in Tahiti.
-Oh! Love Tahiti!

01:24.667 --> 01:25.835
-Have you been?
-No.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.131
-Marianne, you look banging.
-Thanks!

01:30.215 --> 01:33.009
You know, this guy comes here
a couple of times a year,

01:33.092 --> 01:35.220
the least I can do
is put on a little makeup.

01:35.303 --> 01:38.890
I'd come a lot more,
but with her packed schedule, it's tough.

01:38.973 --> 01:42.018
-[Marianne] We make it work.
-[Ethan] That's so sweet. It's good.

We're going to a wedding? I love weddings!

01:57.617 --> 01:59.702
-Well, I didn't RSVP, but yes.
-Yes!

01:59.786 --> 02:02.705
Marianne, you have to RSVP.
That is how weddings work.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.125
I didn't RSVP to your guys' wedding.
It was cool.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.710
-Yeah.
-But I am so excited!

02:07.794 --> 02:09.838
And this is going to be a good one.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.715
The only thing better than a wedding
is a second wedding.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.259
This is going to be a train wreck.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.928
-Why do you make that assumption?
-Look at the bride!

02:17.679 --> 02:20.682
-Oh, she looks sweet.
-[Lisa] She has stupid-face.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.351
She can't help her face.
And who are we to judge?

02:23.434 --> 02:25.353
This is what I do. I am Judge Lisa.

a toast tonight, that's how fine I am.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.861
[overlapping reactions]

09:31.654 --> 09:34.198
-What's in this?
-It's gin.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.993
-Straight gin.
-Gin is all they had.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.954
-[Tag] Wow, we don't do this in Australia.
-We don't do this here.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.124
Yeah, it sucked. Whoo!

09:43.207 --> 09:46.043
Okay, now they're gonna do
<i>Charlie's Angels.</i>

09:47.420 --> 09:50.006
Wow. Are you from, like,
one minute in the future?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.716
Ugh. I feel bad.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.009
I support women.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.344
We need to band together
now more than ever.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.640
It just seems like you're very intent
on ripping this wedding a new asshole.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.892
Rich cheated on his wife.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.686
-So?
-So?

10:03.769 --> 10:05.354
He hated her. She hated him.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.982
It was a miserable situation.
They just fought.

10:08.065 --> 10:11.193
Well, then, get divorced
and then sleep with someone else.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.488
I mean, this isn't a wedding,
this is a celebration of cheating.

10:14.572 --> 10:19.076
I don't know. I think guys get married
specifically so that they can cheat.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.036
-What?
-Yeah.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.705
I think then, you know,
it makes it more exciting.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.208
It's, like, less... dull and lame.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.294
The sex is spicier.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.422
-That is the dumbest thing I've heard.
-Thank you.

10:31.505 --> 10:32.840
-From you.
-Thank you.

10:32.923 --> 10:36.177
So, did you all go to school

10:36.260 --> 10:37.720
"in Boston"?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.388
Yes, we did.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.307
Well, we did, as well.

10:41.390 --> 10:45.144
Anka and I plan events for the Harvard
Alumni Association in the area.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.063
We're gonna go dance and leave this.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.358
-Yeah. A pleasure to meet you guys. Howie.
-Right on.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.069
[Anka] You know what might be
up your alley?

10:53.152 --> 10:57.365
Our upcoming Jazz Brunch
with the Harvard Black Alumni Society.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.700
-Jazz.
-Brunch.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.620
Yeah. Max, you know, here, loves jazz.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.872
-Tell them.
-No one likes jazz.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.165
I gotta go work on this.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.833
-Do you really?
-Yeah.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.753
I think politics
is good to talk about in a way.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.505
You can't write it here?

11:12.588 --> 11:14.548
Oh! This is my jam!

11:15.091 --> 11:17.426
-This is my jam!
-We're never at the fun table!

11:18.135 --> 11:20.054
Would you guys excuse me for one second?

11:20.137 --> 11:21.514
[Anka] It was nice meeting you.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.849
I actually pissed on the fire hydrant.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.017
[all laugh]

11:25.101 --> 11:26.977
Hey, Sam. How's it going?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.563
Ethan, I've been meaning to tell you,

11:29.647 --> 11:33.567
I've read all your books
and they're incredible, I love them.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.236
I'm really impressed.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.698
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you very much. That's nice to hear.

11:38.781 --> 11:43.744
-What are you working on now?
-It's actually for a younger audience, so.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.498
It's about werewolves. It's YA.
It's for children.

11:48.666 --> 11:52.545
I would never have guessed that. What?
You're writing kids' books?

11:52.628 --> 11:56.590
Yeah, there's actually a lot
of metaphorical aspects about werewolves

11:56.674 --> 11:58.676
that I find extremely interesting.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.386
Yeah? Like what?

12:01.303 --> 12:02.346
Like, um...

12:02.430 --> 12:05.182
I'm, uh...
Actually, I'm still figuring it out, so...

12:05.266 --> 12:07.393
-You'll get it.
-[man] Yo, yo, yo!

12:07.476 --> 12:10.146
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is time

12:10.229 --> 12:12.648
for the Party Dog to eat!

12:12.731 --> 12:14.608
-[growls]
-[laughter]

12:16.318 --> 12:17.403
I've got to go!

12:17.486 --> 12:19.488
-[yelling]
-[laughter]

12:19.822 --> 12:23.075
I'm so sorry. I have to do it at weddings
or people are disappointed.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.702
Check this out.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.038
-Yeah.
-Yeah, alright!

12:28.122 --> 12:30.166
Check this out! Blah!

12:30.249 --> 12:31.292
[all laugh]

12:32.751 --> 12:35.504
Yeah! Yeah, Party Dog!

12:35.963 --> 12:37.840
-Champagne for the toast?
-Yeah, yes.

12:37.923 --> 12:41.385
Hey, everybody, to Rich and to Ashley!

12:41.469 --> 12:44.889
May their marriage be a smashing success!

12:44.972 --> 12:47.975
-Whoo! Yeah!
-[guests gasp]

12:48.058 --> 12:50.019
Do not walk here. Broken glass.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.813
-Broken glass.
-What the fuck, Ethan?

12:52.897 --> 12:55.274
-You're bleeding really bad.
-It was a bad idea.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.735
He's cut. It's okay, I'm a doctor.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.070
[cheering]

13:00.905 --> 13:04.200
[Ethan] I've always wanted to do that.
I'm so sorry. It was a disaster.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.619
It's cool.
I've always wanted to do that, too.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.746
-Now I'm never going to.
-Yeah, I hear you.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.081
-Do you always bring a case with you?
-I do.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.750
-Everywhere you go?
-Yeah.

13:12.833 --> 13:16.045
I'd wear a stethoscope and a white
lab coat everywhere if I could.

13:16.795 --> 13:17.880
Really? Why?

13:17.963 --> 13:20.633
If you wear a uniform,
women wanna fuck you more.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.843
Come on, that's not really true.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.678
That's not really true, is it?

13:24.762 --> 13:26.388
One hundred percent true.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.890
-Really?
-Yes.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.685
When the dog was a married dog, the dog
just hung out with other married dogs.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.187
But now the dog's a single dog

13:33.270 --> 13:37.274
and the single dog has learned a lot
about the single dog's life.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.527
One of the things I learned,
and it's a fact,

13:39.610 --> 13:41.987
if you're in a uniform,
women wanna fuck you more.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.365
-I see.
-So you dress like a policeman.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.450
You dress like a sailor, fireman,

13:46.534 --> 13:48.661
you know, soldier, airplane pilot,

13:48.744 --> 13:50.663
doctor, professional athlete.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.290
-You go out dressed like that...
-Yeah.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.667
...you will be fucking.

13:54.750 --> 13:58.379
So, basically, anything that
you would have dressed up as as a kid?

13:59.588 --> 14:02.258
-Yeah, kinda. Not a ninja, you know.
-Right.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.844
-Well, ninjas fuck. Maybe in Japan.
-Okay. No, I'm with you now.

14:05.928 --> 14:10.599
But if you, a literary academic, were just
out there in the world as a single person

14:10.683 --> 14:13.978
and you did not dress like an astronaut
or a ninja,

14:14.061 --> 14:16.272
you're never gonna get laid,
as a single guy.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.108
But you're not single, so you
don't have to worry about this shit.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.820
But what if I was walking around
wearing a tweed jacket and a turtleneck?

14:22.903 --> 14:25.656
Then you'd be wearing a tweed jacket.
That's not a uniform.

14:25.739 --> 14:26.824
No, that's my uniform.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.951
It's not a uniform
if you choose to wear it.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.454
Every college professor, like,
"Let's dress like this." Not a uniform.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.165
That's just, like,
lack of fashion imagination.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.293
-I don't know what the fuck that is.
-Okay.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.919
Why do you all have elbow pads?

14:39.003 --> 14:41.171
-I don't know.
-Are you all like this all day?

14:41.255 --> 14:43.632
So instead of a traditional speech,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.302
we decided to do something
a little bit different.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.388
-This is for you, Ashley.
-Here we go.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.182
["Cake By The Ocean" playing]

14:52.266 --> 14:54.268
[crowd murmuring]

14:57.688 --> 14:59.857
[scattered cheers]

15:04.194 --> 15:06.447
So over the top. [chuckles]

15:14.121 --> 15:16.665
I can't thank Rich enough, uh...

15:17.082 --> 15:19.335
for helping me through a very dark time.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.254
I won't go into it,
but I hurt a lot of people,

15:22.338 --> 15:23.422
both, um...

15:24.465 --> 15:26.300
figuratively and literally,

15:26.383 --> 15:28.135
and when that thing happened,

15:28.218 --> 15:30.137
lives were changed forever.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.306
And Ashley, I just hope that you

15:32.389 --> 15:35.935
can be there for Rich
when he needs you the most,

15:36.018 --> 15:39.772
the way that he was there for me
when that thing happened.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.232
And those of you who are wondering

15:42.316 --> 15:43.859
what it is I'm talking about...

15:43.943 --> 15:44.985
What happened?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.363
...you might be asking other people
who know.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.032
For those of you who do know
what I'm talking about,

15:50.115 --> 15:51.825
don't tell anyone.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.161
Respect my privacy, thank you.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.288
[tentative applause]

15:58.582 --> 16:00.042
When Rich and Amanda broke up,

16:00.125 --> 16:02.461
we should acknowledge
that a lot of his friends

16:02.544 --> 16:04.880
turned their back on him
when that happened.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.091
I went to his niece's bat mitzvahs

16:07.174 --> 16:09.510
and he was iced very hard.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.930
But if you were willing to go through that
for love...

16:13.681 --> 16:15.641
then it must be something real.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.226
[all] Aww.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.728
Now, I know you all know me
as the Party Dog,

16:19.812 --> 16:21.438
the dog, that big dog!

16:21.522 --> 16:23.482
-The dog! The dog!
-[all bark]

16:27.569 --> 16:28.821
It's the Party Dog!

16:28.904 --> 16:31.323
Seriously, now is not the time for that.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.576
This is not about the dog.
This is about this man.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.997
The man I am proud to call...

16:38.664 --> 16:41.041
my best friend.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.459
Good evening.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.294
My name is Max.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.297
I am a former roommate of Rich's,

16:47.381 --> 16:51.844
but surprisingly,
not a member of the wedding party.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.097
Uh, I can't believe you didn't ask me
to be a groomsman!

16:55.180 --> 16:56.765
Or at least tell me why.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.186
But I think this does give me some insight
into Rich's politics.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.147
Don't ask, don't tell.

17:03.814 --> 17:04.940
[crowd] Ooh...

17:05.024 --> 17:07.359
No politics. No politics.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.863
No politics, alright. I guess
I'll throw out my religion jokes, too.

17:10.946 --> 17:14.199
Let me just go right to the room.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.325
The room!

17:15.409 --> 17:18.912
Can we get a hand for the room?
Is this beautiful? Guys?

17:20.998 --> 17:23.792
Is it spectacular or what out here?

17:23.876 --> 17:27.755
It kind of makes you wonder what Rich's
third wedding is gonna look like.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.840
[laughter]

17:29.923 --> 17:31.717

17:34.762 --> 17:35.763
That's your name...

17:36.305 --> 17:40.434
uh, and it also is
your most redeeming quality.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.437
Oh, shit! I didn't see that coming!

17:43.520 --> 17:46.315
This beautiful woman,
she's marrying you for your looks?

17:46.398 --> 17:50.486
As a gay man,
I think I can safely say she is not.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.480
Get up off of that cube!

20:31.563 --> 20:32.773
[music stops]

20:32.856 --> 20:33.899
Not the cake!

20:33.982 --> 20:35.275
[guests gasp]

20:43.951 --> 20:45.244
[crowd gasps]

20:46.036 --> 20:47.746
-Oh, fuck me.
-Oh, my God!

20:49.539 --> 20:50.666
Oh, my God.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.753
Yo, yo, yo.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.088
Can I talk to you a sec?

20:56.171 --> 20:57.464
Sure, yeah.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.634
-What do you know about Sam?
-A little. I just moved to the city.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.470
-I haven't seen her in a long time.
-Where's her husband?

21:03.553 --> 21:04.888
I don't know. He's not here.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.057
Yeah, I mean, are they solid, you know?

21:07.140 --> 21:09.768
Because me and her are vibing,
kind of hitting it off.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.687
Maybe she wants a piece of the Party Dog.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.604
[howls]

21:12.688 --> 21:16.358
Listen, Sam is "married" married
and she's not gonna leave her husband

21:16.441 --> 21:18.485
for some horny surgeon
if that's what you think.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.445
-You're pretty worked up about this.
-[stammers]

21:20.529 --> 21:23.740
You wanted to know the sitch,
I'm telling you. Alright?

21:23.824 --> 21:24.908
She's not...

21:24.992 --> 21:26.868
-What?
-You got a crush on her, big man?

21:27.494 --> 21:29.913
-I do not have a crush on Sam.
-It seems like you do.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.374
You're getting pretty worked up
about this.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.127
You know what?
You're acting like a fucking baby.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.878
-Doing what?
-You're acting like a baby.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.171
-I am?
-Yeah.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.716
-Party Dog is acting like a...
-No, Party Dog's a big dog.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.969
You're acting like a baby
that could ride on my fucking back.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.138
-You hungry?
-Am I hungry?

21:46.221 --> 21:47.931
-Do you need a nap?
-No.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.474
Let me try to cheer you up a bit.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.392
Peek-a-boo!

21:50.475 --> 21:51.977
-That's not funny.
-[laughs]

21:52.060 --> 21:54.146
-I got you. I made you laugh there.
-No.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.897
Why are you being so annoying?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.441
[pants like a dog]

21:57.524 --> 21:59.192
-Don't.
-You know what that means?

21:59.276 --> 22:02.279
-I don't know what that means.
-It means the dog happy. I got news.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.866
-The dog gonna do what the dog gonna do.
-You know what? That's rape.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.995
Well, the dog will get consent, then
the dog will do what the dog gonna do.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.246
That's clunky.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.373
Who ain't gonna give consent to the dog?

22:13.832 --> 22:15.125
[howls]

22:15.208 --> 22:17.210
[guests howl and bark]

22:20.964 --> 22:24.301
Excuse me for just one moment.
I really need to speak to her. Hi.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.054
-Hi, Fun Ethan.
-[clears throat]

22:27.179 --> 22:29.306
-You having fun?
-No, I am not.

22:29.931 --> 22:33.977
Would you mind grabbing our coats
and just stepping outside for a second?

22:34.061 --> 22:35.645
You gotta be kidding me.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.522
You're not a professional dancer?

22:38.231 --> 22:40.400
You're not a professional flirter?

22:40.484 --> 22:41.568
Part-time.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.405
No, I'm an online lifestyle guru.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.157
[Lisa quietly] Yeah, okay.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.243
-Oh, that's cool. Awesome.
-Yeah.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.704
-Where you going?
-I'm gonna go have a smoke.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.956
-Here, I've got some.
-No, I've got my own.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.958
Oh, wow. I created a monster.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.752
-A little bit.
-A little bit.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.129
She shouldn't smoke.

23:01.588 --> 23:04.966
I just posted an article about it
and it's really bad for your skin.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.594
Yeah, or your lungs.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.639
Actually, that has been debunked.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.559
You ruined my night.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.978
Whoa. What happened to Fun Ethan?

23:17.062 --> 23:20.774
Fun Ethan was abandoned by his friends
and stranded with Howie and Anka

23:20.857 --> 23:24.027
and had to watch you
throw yourself at your ex-boyfriend.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.195
Jesus Christ.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.907
I'm sorry, if you wanted to make me
jealous, you did it. I'm jealous, okay?

23:28.990 --> 23:31.785
You're jealous?
You have a fucked-up way of showing it!

23:31.868 --> 23:32.702
What?

23:32.786 --> 23:35.205
You never showed up at the hotel.
It was a dick move.

23:35.288 --> 23:39.000
Especially after your whole
"I really need you right now" sob story

23:39.084 --> 23:40.418
you gave me at the vineyard.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.045
Is that what this is all about?

23:43.004 --> 23:45.549
It was crazy with Lisa and the IVF. I...

23:45.632 --> 23:47.759
-You knew that.
-You could have texted me.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.429
-You texted me, told me you weren't going!
-Don't lie! You weren't coming.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.347
Whatever.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.849
I came here to have a good time

23:53.932 --> 23:57.936
and not to sit there and watch you
just fawn over Dr. Horn Dog Party Dog.

23:58.019 --> 24:01.148
How do you think I feel?
I watch you and Lisa all the time.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.608
I'm not flirting with her to rile you up!

24:03.692 --> 24:06.778
-Forget me and go dance with your wife.
-I wanna dance with you!

24:06.862 --> 24:08.572
What are we, in seventh grade?

24:12.033 --> 24:14.786
I acquired a taste
for those gin shots of yours.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.371
Did you? I'm glad you liked them.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.331
[Anka] We are in the alumni directory.

24:18.415 --> 24:21.835
Maybe the four of us
can get dinner at the club sometime.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.253
[Howie] Great idea, bub.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.797
-We're not-- Hey!
-What are you doing out here?

24:25.881 --> 24:28.675
-[stammers] She's your wife?
-Yes, she is my wife.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.969
She is my wife, yes.

24:31.553 --> 24:35.056
Well, Ethan, whichever one's your wife,
she should join us.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.475
This is definitely my wife.
Definitely my wife.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.519
-Good night.
-Good night, all.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.021
Alright, good night. Thank you.

24:43.523 --> 24:44.733
Boy, they were drunk.

24:44.816 --> 24:45.984
Really into Harvard.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.485
Does anyone want a drink?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.030
Uh, no, thanks.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.032
-I'm good.
-Okay. See you inside.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.121
Um... What was... What was that?
What's going on?

24:58.997 --> 25:00.707
Nothing. Nothing. Um...

25:00.790 --> 25:02.876
Samantha wanted to, um...

25:02.959 --> 25:05.212
wanted to talk to me about, uh...

25:05.545 --> 25:07.756
about her... about her ex-boyfriend.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.927
It looked like you were having
an argument or something.

25:12.427 --> 25:13.637
No, we weren't.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.806
She wanted to hear a male perspective
on a particular issue.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.935
-Yeah, which issue?
-It's really not even worth mentioning.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.355
It's stupid. Let's get inside.
You want to cut a rug with Fun Ethan?

25:23.438 --> 25:24.606
I'm gonna finish this.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.399
Are-- Oh.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.069
-Are you becoming a smoker again?
-No.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.740
It's just, you have another cigarette
ready and waiting in your ear.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.243
Oh. I forgot about that one.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.997
-Uh, alright, so I'll see you in there.
-Yeah.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.374
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

25:45.752 --> 25:49.047
["Electric Boogie" playing]

26:08.817 --> 26:10.777
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.237
How's your night going?

26:12.320 --> 26:15.031
Oh, it's not great. This wedding blows.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.241
Really?

26:16.449 --> 26:21.121
I mean, they haven't played enough Black
Eyed Peas, but that's my only complaint.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.417
Your Party Dog gave a terrible speech.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.253
You mean the toast Paul gave?
I thought that was sweet.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.799
I don't know. I mean, maybe the dog
was barking up the wrong tree.

26:32.882 --> 26:36.261
Yeah, I guess it was sweet in the sense
that it forced us all to celebrate

26:36.344 --> 26:40.098
two people who got what they wanted
at someone else's expense.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.103
Well, maybe Rich married the wrong person
the first time around.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.813
-Mm.
-It happens.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.357
I'm Jon's second wife, remember?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.609
I do, yeah.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.779
Look, life is short.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.199
You gotta go for what you want
or you're gonna end up regretting it.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.452
Even if it means
that you hurt some people.

27:01.286 --> 27:04.205
Um, so you're saying that
I should be happy for Rich

27:04.289 --> 27:07.584
because he went for it
when he cheated on his wife?

27:08.710 --> 27:09.836
Rich is 40,

27:09.919 --> 27:12.881
and God bless him, now he can
spend the second half of his life

27:12.964 --> 27:16.217
with a chick he's crazy about
instead of someone he grew apart from.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.428
It makes sense
that you'd take Rich's side.

27:18.511 --> 27:19.679
I'm not taking sides.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.265
I'm just saying
it's not always black and white.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.060
Are you seriously
giving me a fucking lecture right now?

27:25.143 --> 27:26.853
It felt like you just gave me one.

27:31.983 --> 27:35.820
You know, the thing about weddings
is that if you're not in the mood...

27:35.904 --> 27:37.822
they're the worst place in the world.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.576
[door creaks open]

27:43.536 --> 27:45.372
[smooth funk playing]

28:01.096 --> 28:02.222
I have to go to the bathroom.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.807
-I'll miss you.
-Miss you, too.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.560
Can you guys believe
how good this wedding was?

28:07.977 --> 28:09.604
Didn't I say it would all work out?

28:09.687 --> 28:11.815
When I get married,
I want it to be exactly like this,

28:11.898 --> 28:13.983
just surrounded by all my old friends.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.693
-You wanna get married?
-Yeah.

28:16.611 --> 28:19.948
I mean, I don't know if Marianne
shares that view, but...

28:20.573 --> 28:21.658
I'd like to.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.745
Well, the important thing is
that you guys make each other happy.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.081
-Marriage is just a label.
-[Lisa] Is it?

28:28.164 --> 28:30.500
You see, I think that it's more than that.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.502
You know, Tag, life is short.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.797
You should go for what you want
or you're gonna regret it.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.132
She's right.

28:38.007 --> 28:40.969
Marriage is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.178
[Tag] This is terrifying.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.682
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna propose.

28:45.765 --> 28:46.850
There she is.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.852
Shh. Don't do anything.

28:48.935 --> 28:51.020
-Hey, baby.
-[Ethan] Hey.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.273
To Rich and Ashley.

28:54.482 --> 28:56.818
-To Rich and Ashley.
-To Rich and Ashley.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.320
What happened?

28:59.988 --> 29:02.323
What was the traumatic thing
that happened?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.159
You'll never know.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.870
[heavy breathing]

29:08.121 --> 29:09.372
[moaning]

29:14.753 --> 29:15.920
[exhales]

29:16.421 --> 29:17.839
[groans]

29:27.474 --> 29:30.059
And then I made this joke
about the bridesmaids

29:30.143 --> 29:32.270
that was a little risky, uh,

29:32.353 --> 29:34.522
but it just brought the house down.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.150
It just killed. I killed it.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.693
I just killed it.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.237
Um...

29:41.738 --> 29:43.072
I just miss you, Felix.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.493
Sorry. I'm sorry.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.578
[slow rock song playing]

30:17.440 --> 30:18.983
Hey, look at this.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.070
[in goofy voice] I should probably
take this to the dry cleaner.

30:22.153 --> 30:26.032
Marry? No! Tag, what were you thinking?

30:26.115 --> 30:29.744
I don't even know. Your friends,
they kind of talked me into it. I just...

30:30.078 --> 30:33.456
Lisa gave me this whole beautiful speech
about seizing the moment.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.374
You know?

30:34.457 --> 30:37.126
-How did it go again?
-I don't remember.

30:37.210 --> 30:40.964
You know how I feel about marriage.
I've been clear on this since college.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.424
Most people have that opinion in college

30:43.508 --> 30:45.301
and then they grow out of it.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.720
Stop trying to make me you, okay?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.514
I've chosen this life and I like it!

30:50.098 --> 30:51.975
You two need to find a new place now.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.269
You're crowding me
and you're crowding the bunny.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.274
You know what?
I'm gonna sleep out here tonight.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.151
-Yeah, that's probably for the best.
-Yeah.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.821
[Marianne] I'm sorry.

31:09.659 --> 31:10.869
Wipeout.
