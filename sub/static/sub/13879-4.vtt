00:43.371 --> 00:45.038
Where is my jerk-off mag?

00:45.108 --> 00:48.676
I left it right here so that
I might arouse myself in the

00:48.699 --> 00:50.999
comfort and privacy
of my own recliner.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.476
I figured you might
like to read this.

00:53.478 --> 00:54.844
What is this?

00:54.846 --> 00:57.180
This is Meatwad's
new graphic novel.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.348
Oh, it's new!

00:58.350 --> 01:02.919
Well, technically, it's book four in the
series, but I want to lead off with it,

01:02.921 --> 01:04.921
you know, gets you
into the world.

01:04.967 --> 01:08.368
Well, your world is about to
crumble before your eyes!

01:09.175 --> 01:12.910
Torn to shreds by a
tsunami of hate.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.046
It's too thick for my trouble!

01:16.048 --> 01:18.615
Yeah, that's the
unabridged version.

01:18.617 --> 01:22.619
It's called "The venturesome adventures
of Rocket Horse and Jet Chicken."

01:23.298 --> 01:24.864
You have an outline?
I'll rip that up.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.539
It's pretty entertaining, actually
Shake. You should definitely read it.

01:27.605 --> 01:29.167
You know you can't judge
a book by its cover.

01:29.238 --> 01:31.706
You can with this one in a
big way 'cause first off,

01:31.708 --> 01:33.341
it's coated in ranch, which

01:33.343 --> 01:37.077
means somebody had wings and
didn't bother sharing with me!

01:37.136 --> 01:40.271
We spread ranch on the cover
to entice the reader.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.780
Page two is where
I lay the hook.

01:42.782 --> 01:44.916
Come on, Shake, read it.

01:44.918 --> 01:46.617
It's a page turner, man.

01:46.627 --> 01:50.796
Yeah, that's exactly what
Frylock said on the back.

01:50.798 --> 01:52.465
"It's a page turner... Frylock."

01:52.467 --> 01:55.367
And then there's a bunch of
space there, and that's where I

01:55.369 --> 01:57.069
need to fill with
a blurb from you.

01:57.071 --> 01:58.504
Summarize it.

01:58.873 --> 02:00.372
Just give me the broad strokes.

02:00.374 --> 02:02.708
I'm looking for more feeling.
I don't need details.

02:02.710 --> 02:04.009
Okay.

02:04.011 --> 02:06.378
"Once upon a time, there was a

02:06.380 --> 02:08.681
superhero named Jet Chicken and

02:08.683 --> 02:11.851
his trusty steed sidekick
Rock... Rocket Horse.

02:11.853 --> 02:13.719
And they were shaking hands and

02:13.721 --> 02:18.256
signing autographs at the Krayo
dealership off I-80 Eastbound to Newark.

02:18.289 --> 02:22.064
Hey, there, buddy. You looking to put
yourself in a Krayo sunsplash today, huh?

02:22.066 --> 02:26.134
No, I'm just here to meet the original
Jet Chicken and Rocket Horse.

02:26.136 --> 02:28.203
Well, you're looking
at Rocket Horse.

02:28.205 --> 02:30.505
Maybe I can sign for the
both of us, you know?

02:30.594 --> 02:34.697
I'm sure I could get it
close to how he signs it.

02:34.699 --> 02:37.100
I kind of would like to meet
the original Jet Chicken

02:37.114 --> 02:39.514
just 'cause, you know,
that's what the radio said.

02:39.578 --> 02:41.678
Jet Chicken's in the bathroom.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.278
Hey, we got a customer here!

02:44.343 --> 02:47.444
- Again?
- Yes, we have an actual customer.

02:47.446 --> 02:50.314
Maybe you want to get
the hell out of there.

02:53.719 --> 02:55.520
- He's gonna be a while.
- Okay.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.075
What's Jet Chicken like
in private moments?

02:58.077 --> 02:59.743
You really want to know?

02:59.745 --> 03:02.713
Yeah, you know I do.
I'm a huge fan, man.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.815
Well, uh, he's kind of paranoid.

03:04.817 --> 03:07.351
He has an unhealthy
obsession with food.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.986
He gets angry at the drop of a

03:08.988 --> 03:10.888
hat and starts suing everyone in

03:10.890 --> 03:14.134
sight, but, you know, for
the most part, he's a...

03:14.860 --> 03:17.394
- Fat, lazy piece of [bleep]
- Dang.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.963
Hey, there he is... Jet Chicken!

03:20.038 --> 03:21.837
Oh, so glad you're back, man.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.085
If you expect me to sign
autographs all afternoon in the

03:24.139 --> 03:25.771
hot sun, then I expect toilet

03:25.773 --> 03:28.407
tissues and scanted candles
in my private toilet area!

03:29.546 --> 03:31.646
That's really fun, Jet Chicken,

03:31.648 --> 03:33.882
but, uh, hey, we got a fan here.

03:34.918 --> 03:37.552
- Want my autograph?
- Yeah, absolutely.

03:37.554 --> 03:41.823
Can you make it out to "my
biggest fan, Meatwad"?

03:41.825 --> 03:44.893
Oh, I'd love to, but we're
only paid to sign until 4:00,

03:44.895 --> 03:47.529
and it's already 4:08, Jerry!

03:47.531 --> 03:49.197
- [Bleep] Jerry.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:49.199 --> 03:51.633
- Where's that piece of [bleep].
- Oh, calm down.

03:51.635 --> 03:53.235
Uh, he said he had
to go to the bank.

03:53.738 --> 03:55.270
[Bleep] spending his days at the bank.

03:55.272 --> 03:57.639
You and I are out here signing
autographs in a parking lot

03:57.665 --> 04:00.199
that's hotter than the
surface of the [bleep] sun!

04:00.236 --> 04:02.836
Hey, you mind helping me
pack up the inflatable here?

04:02.892 --> 04:04.688
- I'll help.
- No, <i>him.</i>

04:05.118 --> 04:09.569
I want it to be him, all right?
I got to do this myself every [bleep] time!

04:09.664 --> 04:13.266
Rocket Horse, I will help as soon
as I get out of the bathroom.

04:13.335 --> 04:15.402
You just went to the bathroom!

04:15.404 --> 04:19.373
I know, but I think all those soda refills
really did a number on that gyro.

04:19.375 --> 04:22.309
Why do you think I picked up
the chili dog on the way home?

04:22.317 --> 04:24.184
Ugh, had to throw
most of it out.

04:24.186 --> 04:25.285
Greek special, my ass.

04:26.188 --> 04:29.088
More like chili dogseseses...

04:29.090 --> 04:32.624
Five of them, plus onion rings.
Guy's a pig.

04:32.657 --> 04:34.390
Well, we've all been there.

04:34.406 --> 04:36.740
No, no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

04:36.742 --> 04:37.909
- This is him every day.
- Oh, fan!

04:37.936 --> 04:39.135
Fan, come to me at once!

04:39.137 --> 04:43.072
What you need, Jet Chicken? You
want me to gobble for justice?

04:46.611 --> 04:48.411
No, I-I don't
know what that is.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.681
Listen, I need a wet vac in here. This...
this thing's overflowing.

04:51.683 --> 04:55.685
There's no wet vac out here, all right?
Jerry didn't provide one.

04:55.746 --> 04:56.978
[Bleep] Jerry.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.539
Of course he didn't provide one.

04:58.541 --> 05:00.174
- Fan.
- I'm here.

05:00.176 --> 05:02.577
I've got a job for you
when I get out of here.

05:02.579 --> 05:04.679
Okeydokey. Just tell me when.

05:04.748 --> 05:06.081
Actually, come on in here.

05:06.083 --> 05:07.749
I need help getting out of here.

05:07.751 --> 05:11.253
All I need to do is slip on one of
these things and break my elbow again.

05:13.891 --> 05:15.123
Ring it again.

05:18.195 --> 05:20.295
I don't think no one's home.

05:20.297 --> 05:22.864
He's home. His jeep's here.
Ring it again.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.029
Maybe he's asleep.

05:26.113 --> 05:27.380
How would you know?
Are you in there?

05:27.429 --> 05:30.163
Oh, come on, lay off, Jet.
He's doing you a favor.

05:30.165 --> 05:32.799
- Look, if he sees me on his
- lawn waving a gun around, he's

05:32.856 --> 05:34.389
gonna pretend not to be home.

05:34.391 --> 05:38.627
M-maybe you ought to hide better
over there behind the bushes.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.095
Oh, good idea, fan.

05:40.097 --> 05:43.631
Maybe I ought to pull out ultra
beak and show you how it works.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.473
One peck to the
brain, it's over!

05:46.710 --> 05:49.993
Okay, great, now he
knows we're out here.

05:50.057 --> 05:52.450
- Rocket Horse, kick the door in.
- You kick the door in!

05:52.527 --> 05:54.727
Oh, God, did someone see
a bathroom around here?

05:54.729 --> 05:59.231
Ah, sunroof. Well,
looky, looky, looky.

06:02.137 --> 06:04.771
Mr. Fancy with your big
house in the suburbs.

06:04.773 --> 06:09.308
Is this, like, the headquarters of
some supervillain or something?

06:09.442 --> 06:11.976
Ooh. Wait a minute. Nope,
not quite done yet.

06:12.492 --> 06:15.126
It's the doctor who fouled
up his gastric bypass.

06:15.128 --> 06:18.329
Go ahead, tell him how the damn
thing leaks every time I eat.

06:18.331 --> 06:19.497
It's... it's not.

06:19.499 --> 06:21.232
This is what happens when you

06:21.234 --> 06:24.168
don't exercise and you order
queso with everything.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.838
Nuh-unh! It's genetics.
That's what happened.

06:26.840 --> 06:31.074
My father was a large man. I was
cursed with <i>his</i> weight issues.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.527
Whoa, hold now.

06:32.529 --> 06:35.129
The comic book says, "he
was born of chicken."

06:35.131 --> 06:37.431
No, I got the chicken
powers from my mom.

06:37.433 --> 06:40.335
What was she... like, some
sort of radioactive chicken?

06:40.338 --> 06:42.739
No, dumbass, I'd be
dead if that were true!

06:43.808 --> 06:45.775
I'm getting a headache.

06:45.832 --> 06:49.367
I don't know how nor do I give a [bleep]

06:49.369 --> 06:52.470
how I got the chicken powers!

06:52.996 --> 06:56.799
There's a rumor that his dad would sneak
into barns and have sex with chickens.

06:56.812 --> 07:02.049
- That is a bold-faced lie!
- Well, I mean, how'd you get the jet part?

07:02.051 --> 07:04.584
- What jet part?
- You know, Jet Chicken.

07:04.586 --> 07:06.886
That's just branding.
Did you bring paper?

07:06.976 --> 07:09.544
Got the receipt from dinner,
but I kind of need that

07:09.546 --> 07:11.412
'cause you guys said
you'd reimburse me.

07:11.414 --> 07:12.847
- Thanks, bud.
- Aw, man.

07:12.897 --> 07:15.331
I'm just gonna rub on the lawn.
Help me out of here.

07:15.333 --> 07:16.999
- All right, on three.
- 1, 2...

07:17.001 --> 07:18.768
- No, d-d-don't grab there.
- ...3!

07:22.040 --> 07:24.373
God, oh, you are fat!

07:24.375 --> 07:25.842
Cool, damp grass.

07:25.844 --> 07:29.212
Come on out! Check out your
fancy new chicken - skids!

07:29.214 --> 07:31.013
Oh, crap! Run!

07:31.073 --> 07:33.126
No, come back! Help
me up first, stupid!

07:33.184 --> 07:36.318
Listen, man, I'm sorry you
feel like I botched your

07:36.380 --> 07:40.449
operation, but the judge and the
jury both agreed that I was drunk.

07:40.517 --> 07:41.916
And you still pulled a gun on me

07:41.958 --> 07:43.625
and made me perform surgery on

07:43.627 --> 07:45.961
you because you didn't
want to pay full price.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.464
Put on your walking shoes.

07:47.513 --> 07:50.314
It's time to plug
that leak, doctor.

07:53.705 --> 07:55.239
Aren't you gonna
scrub or something?

07:55.316 --> 07:57.983
Look, I don't want this
to go like the last time.

07:57.985 --> 07:59.451
I want this deal professional.

07:59.453 --> 08:02.187
Fine, but I will reiterate

08:02.245 --> 08:05.346
just so we're all clear, you
do know that I am drunk.

08:06.950 --> 08:10.452
I think we should,
uh, reschedule this.

08:10.522 --> 08:11.691
Right?

08:12.766 --> 08:13.931
Unh!

08:14.380 --> 08:18.114
- That was a bad idea, man.
- He was worthless to me.

08:18.116 --> 08:19.582
Well, <i>now</i> he is.

08:19.584 --> 08:22.852
You're going to perform
the operation.

08:22.854 --> 08:25.088
I'm not a doctor.

08:25.090 --> 08:27.957
You're lying. Scrub in.

08:27.959 --> 08:29.059
Scalpel.

08:30.162 --> 08:32.128
- Is this a scalpel?
- I don't know.

08:32.130 --> 08:34.860
- You're the doctor.
- Yes, I am.

08:38.837 --> 08:40.669
Suction.

08:45.744 --> 08:47.577
Suction complete.

08:47.579 --> 08:51.047
Jet Chicken, wake up and
take a look at the new you.

08:55.087 --> 08:56.319
Come on, get up.

08:56.988 --> 08:58.655
- He's dead.
- Oh, no.

08:58.657 --> 09:00.890
Oh, yes, and I am free

09:00.892 --> 09:05.628
finally of that enormous
tumor in my ass!

09:06.274 --> 09:07.807
What are we gonna do now?

09:12.589 --> 09:15.890
Self-defense. You saw it.

09:15.892 --> 09:19.527
So, <i>now</i> what are we gonna do?

09:19.649 --> 09:23.551
- Whee! Whoo!
- Freedom!

09:24.243 --> 09:26.544
And then they rode the
roller coaster into the

09:26.591 --> 09:30.660
night until the FBI and the CIA
and Special Ops stopped the

09:30.674 --> 09:33.809
roller coaster 'cause they were
wanted for questioning in the

09:33.894 --> 09:36.594
untimely, surgical
death of Jet Chicken.

09:36.768 --> 09:38.522
To be continued."

09:38.616 --> 09:41.350
I didn't hear any mention of
them brushing for fibers.

09:41.376 --> 09:43.957
- Yeah, I'm sure they did. I mean...
- But it's not <i>clear.</i>

09:44.020 --> 09:45.487
Well, I think that's implied.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.443
Let me guess. At the end,
they all die, right?

09:47.476 --> 09:50.010
I mean, there's 12 books
in the series, you know?

09:50.012 --> 09:52.947
- They don't die in the end
of this one, certainly.
- Well, why don't they?

09:53.038 --> 09:56.839
I mean, I could make that change, I mean,
if that's something you would like to see.

09:56.916 --> 09:58.883
Or maybe just spit
that out as an option.

09:58.951 --> 10:01.585
You know, let me sleep on it.
We'll reconvene tomorrow.

10:01.587 --> 10:03.253
Is this copyrighted, by the way?

10:03.255 --> 10:04.888
What is copyright?

10:04.890 --> 10:09.156
I said, go get me some coffee, right?
So, go do it!

10:09.300 --> 10:11.101
Now I'm super late for
this meeting I got.

10:11.137 --> 10:13.505
Where are you going with Jet
C... that's golden-rod version!

to leave the house!

Jet Chicken's wound.

That's dope. We love this.

There's a hip-hop
element to this, right?

10:30.933 --> 10:34.101
Uh, I'm thinking more
bluegrass-y 'cause, you know...

10:34.103 --> 10:36.203
- Ugh!
- Maybe a little seger.

10:36.205 --> 10:38.672
Yeah, bluegrass is not

music that rhymes.
