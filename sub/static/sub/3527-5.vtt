You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

To get to the heart of the story,

<i>~ Season 1 - Episode 5 ~
"Arise, My Lord"</i>

01:31.300 --> 01:34.200
Sir Thomas Boleyn, you are,
by order and permission...

01:34.600 --> 01:39.400
...of His Majesty, King Henry
today created Lord Rochford.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.000
Arise, my lord.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.100
Majesty.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.000
Henry Fitzroy.

02:16.100 --> 02:20.700
Henry Fitzroy, you are, by order
and permission of His Majesty...

02:21.100 --> 02:26.400
...King Henry, today created
Duke of Richmond and of Somerset...

02:27.000 --> 02:29.600
...and Earl of Nottingham.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.600
Arise, Your Grace.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.700
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.900
Your Majesty.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.300
I see His Majesty's bastard son
is made a duke.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.900
Does this mean he is next in rank
to His Majesty?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.600
Next in line to the throne?

03:47.900 --> 03:50.500
Above my daughter?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.000
Yes. Technically.

03:55.100 --> 04:00.800
He is set above all others,
except for a legitimate son.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.600
His Majesty loves our daughter.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.500
He has shown it on many occasions.

04:11.900 --> 04:15.600
I cannot believe he wishes to place
his bastard child above her.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.000
I do not believe...

04:24.200 --> 04:25.900
...that His Majesty...

04:26.700 --> 04:30.900
...was personally responsible
for this action.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.500
After all, our daughter
is engaged to the emperor.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.900
Then Your Majesty has not heard?

04:40.500 --> 04:45.300
The emperor has married
Princess Isabella of Portugal.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.100
Apparently he decided it was not worth
waiting for your daughter to grow up.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.100
Who is to say, perhaps
he was influenced by the fact...

04:54.400 --> 05:00.800
...that the beautiful Isabella brought
with her a dowry of 1 million pounds.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.900
He broke his word.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.900
My Lord.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.200
How your tok ens
and signs of affection frighten me.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.100
How can I be to you
what you think me to be?

05:24.400 --> 05:28.400
You know I am a commoner
and think myself unworthy of your love.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.300
Though the offer of it and the passion
of Your Majesty's words and looks...

05:32.700 --> 05:34.800
...touch both my heart and soul.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.300
"You have flattered me with so many
and such wondrous gifts.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.700
Allow me to send you
this token in return.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.400
Small though it is.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.600
And allow me to remain,
in all things...

05:50.000 --> 05:54.500
...your ever-loving servant. Anne."

06:12.600 --> 06:14.000
Your Grace.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.800
Mama.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.200
Now, Henry, listen to me.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.300
You are going to own
your own house now.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.900
You'll have lots of servants
to help you and look after you.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.800
But you must promise me
to be a good boy.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.600
And thoughtful and kind
to those around you.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.600
You may be set above them...

06:40.300 --> 06:45.300
...but if I find you have grown
too proud, I will be sad and displeased.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.800
Yes, Mama. I promise.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.400
And I promise I'll come
and see you as often as I can.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.900
And I'm sure your new house
will be very grand.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.100
I love you, my darling boy.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.600
I love you.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.800
Do you think they were suspicious?
Ever?

07:18.100 --> 07:20.400
Of course they were suspicious.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.000
Didn't you see the way
his servants looked at you?

07:26.900 --> 07:28.500
But his son was overjoyed.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.200
I mean, His Majesty was overjoyed.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.400
After all, he had waited
many years for the crown.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.800
The old man had hung on grimly.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.000
You need not tell me about that.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.000
What are we going to do?

08:01.300 --> 08:03.600
- Isn't this enough?
- No.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.200
Well, yes. And no.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.200
I shall come to England eventually.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.200
Marry me.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.800
What?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.400
You heard me.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.300
Marry me.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.700
My poor sister.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.400
Indeed.

08:38.600 --> 08:43.400
To be made queen for just a few days.
It seems incredible.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.200
A tragedy.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.500
Upon return, she's to be treated
to every comfort and kindness...

08:48.800 --> 08:50.000
...while she mourns.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.500
As to the great matter
of Your Majesty's annulment...

08:59.900 --> 09:03.000
...I have set up an ecclesiastical court
with Archbishop Warham...

09:03.300 --> 09:06.600
...to consider
and decide on the matter.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.200
It will meet in secret,
if Your Majesty agrees.

09:11.500 --> 09:15.400
Make sure they come
to the right decision, quickly.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.400
I have some further news.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.500
About the emperor.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.000
He has released King Francis.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.300
What?

09:31.600 --> 09:34.300
- I have it on good authority.
- Under what terms?

09:34.600 --> 09:36.200
I have yet to find out.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.700
Why wasn't I consulted?

09:40.900 --> 09:42.900
We are supposed to be allies.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.800
What's he playing at?

09:55.800 --> 09:58.200
Tell his ambassador
I want to see him.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.900
Anne. Anne.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.400
Anne...

10:42.300 --> 10:44.500
...I want to say something to you.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.600
If it pleases you to be
my true, loyal mistress and friend...

10:48.900 --> 10:51.400
...to give yourself up to me,
body and soul.

10:51.700 --> 10:55.000
I promise I'll take you
as my only mistress.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.000
I won't have a thought
or an affection for anyone else.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.400
If you agree to be
my maitresse en titre...

11:05.400 --> 11:08.900
...I promise I shall serve only you.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.500
- Your official mistress?
- Yes.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.700
And you will have everything
you need.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.300
Everything within my power
to give you to you, it's yours, just ask.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.500
What is it?

11:30.700 --> 11:33.100
What have I done to make you
treat me like this?

11:36.500 --> 11:37.800
Done?

11:39.100 --> 11:42.700
What fault have I committed?
Tell me. Tell me.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.400
Your Majesty, I have already given
my maidenhead...

11:45.800 --> 11:47.400
...into my husband's hands.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.700
And whoever he is,
only he will have it.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.100
Anne.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.200
Because I know
how it goes otherwise.

11:58.900 --> 12:03.100
My sister is called
The Great Prostitute by everyone.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.900
I'm sorry if I offended you.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.500
I did not mean to.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.000
I spoke plainly of my true feelings.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.700
Your Majesty...

12:28.300 --> 12:29.600
- Your Majesty.
- Open the door.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.900
- Your Majesty.
- What?!

12:51.100 --> 12:53.200
Mary. Mary.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.400
Go to your room. I will come later.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.600
Another visit, Your Eminence.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.200
You are always so busy.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.200
Majesty, I have some good news.

13:12.900 --> 13:15.600
Since His Majesty has given his son
the Duke of Richmond...

13:16.000 --> 13:19.600
...his own establishment,
he considers it only right and proper...

13:19.900 --> 13:24.100
...that his beloved Princess Mary
should also have hers.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.600
What do you mean?

13:26.900 --> 13:28.800
His Majesty intends to send
the princess...

13:29.100 --> 13:31.600
...to Ludlow castle
in the Welsh Marches.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.600
She will be under the care
of Lady Salisbury, her lady governess.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.600
Her tutor, Dr. Fetherston,
will also accompany her...

13:39.900 --> 13:44.200
...along with 300 members
of the princess's household.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.800
She is to be taken away from me?

13:49.100 --> 13:52.400
No. His Majesty is according her
the true honours of a princess.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.700
This is your idea.

13:56.100 --> 14:00.800
Madam, I am often accused of things
that are not my fault, or responsibility.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.500
Some people are always prone
to speak evil...

14:03.800 --> 14:06.700
...without knowledge of the truth.

14:07.100 --> 14:10.400
I fear they may have poisoned
Your Majesty's mind against me.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.300
You are taking my child from me.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.000
My child.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.800
You are tearing her from me as if
you were tearing her from my womb.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.500
I do as His Majesty commands.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.300
No.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.200
You are my enemy.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.300
Your Majesty is unfair.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.000
Get out of my sight.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.400
Mary.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.100
Mary.

15:10.300 --> 15:14.000
The ambassador of His Highness
the Holy Roman Emperor.

15:20.300 --> 15:24.900
Senor Mendoza,
I am not pleased to see you.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.700
Majesty?

15:26.900 --> 15:29.700
Your master has broken
all his promises.

15:30.100 --> 15:33.400
He has taken our money
but used it against us.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.800
He has negotiated a separate peace...

15:36.100 --> 15:38.700
...with the king of France
and His Holiness the Pope...

15:39.000 --> 15:41.500
...while neglecting
his friend and ally.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.200
He has not kept faith.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.000
Charles has nothing
but words for me.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.100
Deeds he keeps for others.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.500
The emperor would never
betray Your Majesty.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.100
Never, he regards you as his uncle.
He...

15:54.500 --> 15:59.200
His fucking uncle?! How old am I?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.000
Well, Your Highness
must consider that you, yourself...

16:14.500 --> 16:16.700
...may not always have kept
to your obligations.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.200
After all, we received only
half the gold that was promised.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.700
Your accusations are totally false.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.500
Unacceptable.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.800
I will answer
for my honourable conduct...

16:28.100 --> 16:29.800
...whoever contradicts me.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.800
Leave.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.900
My Lord Rochford.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.700
Yes, Your Honour?

17:08.099 --> 17:11.099
The emperor sends you
his congratulations on your elevation.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.099
What does the emperor care
about my elevation?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.500
He cares to have friends
at the English court.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.400
And pays for the privilege.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.800
Does he have many friends here
already?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.599
Several.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.400
- You would know them.
- And what does friendship pay?

17:26.800 --> 17:29.100
One thousand crowns a year.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.100
I will certainly consider
His Highness's offer.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.600
- Your Grace.
- My lord.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.000
So how did you find
the imperial ambassador?

17:53.300 --> 17:54.800
Stimulating.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.800
Indeed?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I find him a man of great principle.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.500
Indeed.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.400
Hallelujah.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.100
Hallelujah indeed.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.000
My lord.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.200
No, I was just listening.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.600
Yes, l...

18:49.600 --> 18:51.800
You have such a talent.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.100
Orpheus himself
would be jealous I think.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.000
Sir.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.900
A very good day to you ladies.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.700
- Isn't the music divine?
- Yes, I quite agree.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.600
Ladies.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
No, George. Please, give it back.

19:34.800 --> 19:39.100
"I have given you my heart, now
I desire to dedicate my body to you."

19:39.500 --> 19:40.700
No, please.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.900
"Written by the hand of him
who in heart, body and will...

19:44.300 --> 19:49.700
...is your loyal
and most ensured servant, HR."

19:50.900 --> 19:55.200
And look. He's drawn a little heart
between the letters H and R.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.100
Just imagine.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.800
The king of England writing
to my little sister.

20:02.100 --> 20:06.000
Promising to be her servant.
It's incredible.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.100
- Give me the letter.
- He's in love with you.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.400
Give me the letter.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.800
You're not in love with him, are you?

20:34.300 --> 20:35.700
He wants a divorce?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.200
It's not a divorce.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.300
King wants an annulment
on the grounds...

20:40.600 --> 20:43.200
...that he was never married
in the first place.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.700
By marrying his brother's wife...

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
...he has offended the laws
of both God and man.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.800
He simply wants that recognised.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.500
The pope gave him a dispensation
to marry Catherine.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.500
Indeed he did. No one denies it.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.200
But the king feels
more beholden to God...

20:59.500 --> 21:00.800
...than he does to the pope.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.800
His conscience is genuinely stricken,
and tender.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.700
He has disobeyed God's injunction...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.300
...and there is nothing His Holiness
can say or do that can alter that.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.000
The pope is God's representative
on Earth.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.200
- He speaks for him.
- Come, come, Thomas.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.100
What are you pretending?

21:19.400 --> 21:21.500
Kings get divorced all the time.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.300
And popes always find an excuse.

21:25.300 --> 21:28.000
I know you're an idealist
but you're not stupid.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.900
If Henry wants an annulment,
who's to stop him?

21:31.200 --> 21:33.800
All right. You talk of fact.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.400
Let me give you a fact.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.800
Catherine is not only a great queen
and the daughter of kings...

21:40.100 --> 21:42.900
...she is also immensely popular
throughout the country.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.800
God forbid that the king should abandon
her just to ease his own conscience.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.700
I don't think the English people
would ever forgive him.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.800
Does she know yet?

22:03.500 --> 22:05.000
Does she know yet?

22:11.900 --> 22:16.900
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.

22:19.600 --> 22:24.000
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.

22:28.200 --> 22:33.000
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.700
The queen.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.400
Good people of Lambeth.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.400
On this Good Friday,
the Queen's Majesty will distribute...

22:56.700 --> 22:59.200
...alms to you unfortunate...

22:59.600 --> 23:03.200
...but true and loyal subjects
of Their Majesties...

23:03.500 --> 23:06.200
...in the Christian spirit
of charity and love.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.200
- Your Majesty.
- Bless you.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.400
- Your Majesty.
- And you.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.900
God be with you.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.700
In good faith.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.100
May you know him in deed.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.000
In good faith.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
I beseech you, help me.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.200
God bless you.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.400
Do not be afraid.
You are God's child.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.200
Want some business?

24:13.500 --> 24:15.100
Sorry, love.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.700
My dear William.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.100
Charles, welcome back.
Good to see you.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.200
You too. Come sit down,
have a drink.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.500
I don't understand. Why here?

24:32.900 --> 24:35.300
We've been expecting you
back at court.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.300
How is the king?

24:37.600 --> 24:41.300
Anxiously awaiting his sister,
to share her grief.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.100
We're married.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.100
- What?
- She and me.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.500
We're married.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.900
- You and?
- Yes.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.600
Here you are, sir. One for you.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.700
You have to tell him.
You have to tell the king.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.800
I have to tell him? Why do I have to?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.900
Because it will be better
coming from you.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.400
What's the matter?
Have you lost your nerve?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.400
This is no laughing matter.

25:23.700 --> 25:24.900
Then why did you do it?

25:27.300 --> 25:28.800
You know me.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.500
I don't always think.

25:32.700 --> 25:35.400
Yes, you do. Just not with your head.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.500
Henry.

25:55.700 --> 25:57.900
Catherine,
I have something to tell you.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.400
As far as I am concerned,
our marriage is at an end.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.900
Actually, there is no need to end
something which has never been.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.700
You and I were never truly married.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.100
It was a misunderstanding
of scripture...

26:21.700 --> 26:24.600
...and a papal misapplication
of canon law.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.100
It's true I did not know
about these things before...

26:29.500 --> 26:35.300
...but it has been brought to light
by learned opinion...

26:36.500 --> 26:38.900
...and it weighs down
my conscience.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.700
It has forced me to give up
your bed and board once and for all.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.500
All that remains...

26:54.800 --> 26:56.900
...is for you to choose
where to live...

26:58.300 --> 27:00.500
...and to retire there
as quickly as possible.

27:03.600 --> 27:08.900
I swear to you
all will be done for the best.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.900
Your Grace, my lords.

27:38.700 --> 27:42.300
I believe you know why we are
gathered here in private.

27:42.700 --> 27:46.000
We are here
at His Majesty's bidding.

27:46.300 --> 27:51.000
His Majesty has requested
an enquiry into the nature...

27:51.400 --> 27:54.700
...of his marriage
to Catherine of Aragon...

27:55.100 --> 27:58.600
...for the tranquillity of his conscience
and the health of his soul.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.100
For as it says in Leviticus:

28:01.400 --> 28:05.900
"If a man shall take his brother's wife,
it is an impurity...

28:06.300 --> 28:08.600
...he has covered
his brother's nakedness...

28:08.900 --> 28:10.900
...they shall be childless."

28:13.100 --> 28:16.300
Now, if, my lords, we are able to agree
between ourselves...

28:16.600 --> 28:19.100
...that the marriage was, in fact,
never legal...

28:19.500 --> 28:23.600
...and was proceeded with against
both canon and ecclesiastical law...

28:23.900 --> 28:27.200
...as His Majesty, to his great regret,
has come to believe...

28:27.600 --> 28:31.300
...then it is my understanding
that, as papal legate...

28:31.700 --> 28:36.300
...I myself have the power and authority
to dissolve and end it.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.100
Of course
I would be grateful to hear...

28:39.400 --> 28:42.700
...the opinions of your lordships
on this great matter.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.000
Your Grace?

28:46.300 --> 28:48.800
I am inclined to agree
with Your Eminence...

28:49.100 --> 28:53.700
...though I reserve judgement
until I have heard all opinion.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.000
My Lord Fischer.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.100
I see no merit in the king's case,
so expressed.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.800
None whatsoever.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.600
If there was any obstacle
to the king's marriage...

29:07.900 --> 29:10.300
...then it was overcome
by the pope's dispensation.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.000
The marriage was therefore legal.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.400
As Your Eminence knows,
divorce is disallowed by the Church.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.100
That is my opinion.

29:31.200 --> 29:35.300
Madam, Lady Salisbury's here.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
Your Majesty.

29:45.600 --> 29:49.100
I have brought your daughter,
to say goodbye.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.500
- My baby.
- Your Majesty must be reassured.

29:57.900 --> 30:01.600
The princess will be well taken care of,
as befitting her station.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.400
You will be sent regular reports
of her health and accomplishments.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.500
And naturally, you will visit her...

30:08.700 --> 30:11.400
...during the course
of Your Majesty's progresses.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.800
You must make sure
she practises her music.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.900
She has a great facility for music.

30:29.900 --> 30:33.200
Be strong, my daughter.
Remember who you are.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.700
The descendent of Isabella
and Ferdinand of Castille.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.300
The only daughter of the
king of England.

30:41.400 --> 30:45.400
Be strong, and be true,
and one day...

30:46.300 --> 30:49.500
One day you will be queen.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.700
Yes, Mama.

31:16.300 --> 31:17.800
Is he sorry?

31:19.700 --> 31:21.800
Does he repent it?

31:22.600 --> 31:25.600
Tell me, does he beg
my forgiveness?

31:26.600 --> 31:28.600
Your Majesty knows His Grace.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.100
You mean he does not.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.500
Send in my sister.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.000
You are not wearing black.

32:11.700 --> 32:14.200
No, Your Majesty.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.500
But you are in mourning.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.600
Your husband is dead.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.300
I said your husband is dead.

32:26.900 --> 32:30.900
He's alive. My husband is alive.

32:31.300 --> 32:35.600
I gave you no permission
to marry Brandon, nor would I ever.

32:36.100 --> 32:39.000
You gave me your promise.
I was free to choose.

32:39.400 --> 32:43.400
I made no promise.
You are mistaken.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.000
How dare you look at me?

32:47.300 --> 32:51.400
I am your lord and master,
not your brother.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.300
You are both banished from court.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.200
You will relinquish
your London houses.

33:11.500 --> 33:15.300
You will remove yourself
from my sight.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.300
Do you understand?

33:18.000 --> 33:22.100
Yes, Your Majesty.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.900
- And Margaret?
- What?

33:30.100 --> 33:33.400
I have yet to decide whether
to make your bedmate a head shorter.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.800
Say yes.

34:18.199 --> 34:19.600
Say yes.

34:20.900 --> 34:23.199
- You're married.
- So?

34:23.900 --> 34:25.100
So...

34:26.500 --> 34:29.400
- Why deny me?
- I do not love you.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.800
- Is that all?
- For me, yes.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.300
You're so beautiful, Tom.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.699
You're a lord.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.900
What am I?

34:48.699 --> 34:50.300
A genius.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.400
What is it?

35:26.700 --> 35:28.700
A parcel, Your Majesty.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.000
Who is it from?

35:39.300 --> 35:41.400
The Lady Anne Boleyn.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.800
A ship, with women on board.
What is a ship?

36:04.200 --> 36:09.900
A ship is protection,
like the ark that protected Noah.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.300
And the diamond?

36:18.600 --> 36:21.500
What does it say
in the Roman de la Rose?

36:23.700 --> 36:30.300
"A heart as hard as a diamond,
steadfast, never changing."

36:31.800 --> 36:33.400
She is the diamond.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.800
And I am the ship.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.500
She says yes.

36:45.700 --> 36:48.300
King Francis is eager
for a rapprochement...

36:48.600 --> 36:50.300
...with Your Majesty.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.900
He is disgusted
at the treacherous behaviour...

36:53.200 --> 36:54.600
...of the emperor towards you.

36:54.900 --> 36:59.600
Behaviour he knows only too well
having suffered it himself at firsthand.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.500
And offers you instead
a true and lasting friendship.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.400
It is true,
the emperor has betrayed us.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.700
Perhaps he was never sincere
in the first place.

37:18.100 --> 37:20.100
Even so, he still has friends at court.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.200
Which friends?

37:24.600 --> 37:28.100
My agents intercepted this letter.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.700
The letter is from the queen.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.300
She asks why the emperor
doesn't write to her more often.

37:36.600 --> 37:42.800
And promises, as always,
to be his true and humble servant.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.200
His servant. Not mine.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.400
Tell the French ambassador
that we are in the mood...

38:05.800 --> 38:07.900
...for a rapprochement
with King Francis.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.300
Tell him to send delegates.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.600
Let us be allies
against this emperor.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.700
My lady.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.900
I lay claim to your maidenhead.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.900
And I make you this promise.

38:49.300 --> 38:55.800
When we are married,
I will deliver you a son.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.000
No.

39:27.200 --> 39:30.700
I shall honour your maidenhead
until we are married.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.300
No less could I do for love.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.700
Oh, my love.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.300
Love.

39:47.100 --> 39:53.700
By daily proof, you shall me find,
to be to you both loving and kind.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.300
I hate you.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.100
You said it would be all right.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.200
You said he would believe you.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.800
- You promised.
- For the love of God, wife.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.400
Don't call me "wife."

40:27.300 --> 40:29.500
I don't want to be your wife.
I hate you.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.200
No, you don't.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.500
Yes, I do.

40:34.800 --> 40:40.900
If it weren't for you,
I would still be the queen of Portugal.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.100
- And now what am I?
- You are drunk.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.700
And you are foolish.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.800
Henry will forgive us.
He's just standing on his pride.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.200
We just wounded his vanity.
Believe me.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.700
Why should I?

41:04.000 --> 41:10.500
I don't know if you're really brave
or if you're just a fucking fool.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.300
Neither do I.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.500
God.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.000
Thank you, Alice.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.900
I know you've talked to Wolsey.

41:54.200 --> 41:57.100
And I know you do not approve
of what I am trying to do.

41:57.900 --> 42:00.100
It's against your conscience.

42:01.500 --> 42:04.200
And I'm not going to try
and change your mind.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.000
That's unlikely in any case.

42:09.700 --> 42:12.000
But I need you to understand,
Thomas.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.800
I need to explain.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.300
I have been living
with my brother's wife...

42:21.400 --> 42:24.700
...and I have come to believe
their marriage was consummated.

42:26.500 --> 42:31.500
If that is true,
then I have been living in sin.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.900
Can you understand
what that feels like, Thomas?

42:42.500 --> 42:45.100
That is why I asked the cardinal
to examine the matter.

42:50.900 --> 42:54.100
What if it can be proved
that the pope's dispensation was valid?

42:55.700 --> 42:57.600
That there was no sin?

42:59.100 --> 43:01.700
Then I shall be
the happiest man alive.

43:02.400 --> 43:06.100
I shall be content to live with Catherine
until the end of my days.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.900
Wait.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.500
I ask you again.

44:16.800 --> 44:19.500
If the king is so troubled
by his conscience...

44:19.800 --> 44:23.000
...why has he waited so long
to bring this matter to a head?

44:23.400 --> 44:28.300
Because of his love for the queen,
he has denied the truth to himself.

44:28.800 --> 44:33.000
But her failure to produce
a living son is proof of it.

44:33.500 --> 44:36.500
Then he'll want to remarry?

44:36.800 --> 44:41.200
If his marriage is annulled, then, yes,
I am certain he will remarry...

44:41.600 --> 44:44.200
...in the hope of producing an heir.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.900
He has an heir.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I do not believe for a moment...

44:49.300 --> 44:53.000
...that the English people will accept
his bastard son as a legitimate heir.

44:53.400 --> 44:57.400
- Nor does the king.
- He has a legitimate daughter.

44:58.900 --> 45:02.500
My lords, English history
is littered with the tragedies...

45:02.900 --> 45:06.200
...of those who have tried to pass
on their crown to a daughter.

45:08.300 --> 45:13.000
Then he has a new wife in mind?

45:15.400 --> 45:18.000
He has a mind to take one, yes.

45:20.100 --> 45:22.200
It stinks.

45:23.900 --> 45:26.900
I think you should be careful,
my lord.

45:27.400 --> 45:29.100
As should you.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.800
One of the great advantages
of having a library...

45:34.100 --> 45:35.600
...is that it is full of books.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.400
And some of these books
contain ecclesiastical law.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.500
And according to those books...

45:40.800 --> 45:43.700
...you have no authority
to judge this matter.

45:44.200 --> 45:48.300
It is for the pope alone,
or those whom he appoints.

45:48.900 --> 45:50.600
It seems that in this case...

45:50.900 --> 45:52.800
...your reach
has exceeded your grasp.

46:49.300 --> 46:54.000
So I have invited a French delegation
to visit Your Majesty's court...

46:54.400 --> 46:56.700
...to discuss a new treaty,
binding us together...

46:57.100 --> 47:00.200
...in the face of the emperor's
intransigence and aggression.

47:00.700 --> 47:02.900
Good. Excellent.

47:03.800 --> 47:07.200
And since the emperor
has reneged on his promise...

47:07.600 --> 47:10.300
...to marry your daughter,
it could perhaps be politic...

47:10.600 --> 47:13.700
...to resurrect her betrothal
to the dauphin.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.400
Or if the dauphin is already promised
perhaps to the Duke of Orleans...

47:17.800 --> 47:20.400
...King Francis' youngest son.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.700
And what of your secret sessions?

47:25.500 --> 47:27.500
Have they come to a decision?

47:27.900 --> 47:30.600
How soon can I expect
my annulment?

47:30.900 --> 47:34.300
Your Majesty should
not be concerned but...

47:36.100 --> 47:38.000
We were not able to come
to a conclusion.

47:38.400 --> 47:42.100
- Not able?
- The matter is a complex one.

47:42.500 --> 47:44.900
Really? How?

47:45.200 --> 47:46.900
It is my considered opinion...

47:47.200 --> 47:49.800
...that we should apply to His Holiness,
Pope Clement...

47:50.100 --> 47:52.400
...for a ruling on this matter.

47:52.800 --> 47:57.700
Since he loves Your Majesty,
I am certain he will rule in your favour.

47:58.100 --> 48:00.000
I hope so.

48:01.200 --> 48:04.400
I certainly do hope so.
For your sake.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.900
- You can always tell the French.
- Oh, yes.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.500
Ponces.

48:46.200 --> 48:49.200
But they never did anything so clever
as giving Wolsey a pension.

48:49.500 --> 48:50.800
He's never failed them.

48:51.100 --> 48:52.500
We must wait and see.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.700
When the wheel of fortune
has reached its zenith...

48:56.000 --> 48:59.500
...there is only one way for it to go.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.700
Move aside, move aside.
Out of my way.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.800
I bring most important news.

49:13.100 --> 49:15.400
Your Majesty,
Rome has been sacked.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.600
Let him through.

49:24.200 --> 49:27.700
Your Majesty, I bring
most terrible and calamitous news.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.900
Rome has been captured and sacked by
the German and Spanish mercenaries.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.100
They have plundered
and befouled its churches...

49:35.500 --> 49:37.800
...destroyed its relics
and holy treasures...

49:38.100 --> 49:41.000
...tortured and killed thousands
of its priests.

49:45.500 --> 49:47.300
What of His Holiness?

49:48.300 --> 49:51.000
The pope is a prisoner
in the Castel St. Angelo.

49:57.700 --> 49:59.500
He is the emperor's prisoner?

50:00.500 --> 50:01.800
Yes.

50:39.400 --> 50:40.700
Lady Blount.

50:45.300 --> 50:47.100
He caught the sweating sickness.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.400
There was nothing we could do.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.300
He complained this morning
of feeling ill.

50:54.200 --> 50:58.300
And by this evening,
he was in the hands of God.
