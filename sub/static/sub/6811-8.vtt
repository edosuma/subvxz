00:00.700 --> 00:04.430
        - Previously on
       "South of Hell"...

00:04.430 --> 00:06.070
        - Abigail, the next time
 you lay a finger on my brother,

00:06.070 --> 00:07.400
      I'll kill you and me both.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.100
      - Reverend Elijah Bledsoe.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.540
             You took that curse
                   of the demon,

00:10.540 --> 00:11.770
      you turned it into a gift.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.270
- Where did you get this?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.740
                   - I was there
          when the police raided

00:14.740 --> 00:16.440
         your father's compound.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.750
         - [screaming]

00:18.750 --> 00:20.450
- [screams]

00:20.450 --> 00:21.680
- Got anything for me?

00:21.680 --> 00:23.250
              - You still owe me
            for the last get-go.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.620
- I know where to get
the money.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.550
- Five-digit items
are upstairs.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.190
Don't you want
to see the goods?

00:28.190 --> 00:29.760
      - Think you remember
          my daughter.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.229
  The doctors can't cure her.
           Only you.

00:32.229 --> 00:34.760
      - You're not Mommy.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.730
        [both growling]

00:37.730 --> 00:40.130
                     - Mine now!

00:40.140 --> 00:42.700
        -<i> Enos is back. </i>
    - Give your daddy a hug.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.270
     <i> - His spirit could be</i>
        <i> inside anybody.</i>

00:45.270 --> 00:47.070
        - Reminds me of Sangolo.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.040
          That's where the Order
            of Everlasting went.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.380
- I've tried ruling in hell.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.110
It isn't all it's
cracked up to be.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.750
    [growling indistinctly]

00:54.750 --> 00:56.280
- Miss Genie Pool,

00:56.290 --> 00:58.750
with all that anger,
you're making me swoon.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.590
              - What about Enos?

01:00.590 --> 01:02.220
- When that son of a bitch
shows his face,

01:02.220 --> 01:03.660
I'll make him wish
he stayed in hell.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.590
- You used to sit outside
with me at night,

01:05.590 --> 01:07.530
taught me
the constellations.

01:07.530 --> 01:08.800
                    - [chuckles]

01:08.800 --> 01:10.530
     <i> - Think about Grace.</i>

01:10.530 --> 01:12.470
   <i> She's rare and she needs</i>
       <i> to be protected.</i>

01:12.470 --> 01:13.570
       - I'm not afraid of Enos.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.400
- If you knew him,
you would be!

01:15.400 --> 01:17.200
       <i> - So we're clear,</i>
         <i> David's mine.</i>

01:17.210 --> 01:18.370
         - I don't mean to cause
                    any trouble.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.670
      - Girls like you never do.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.840
- What's that?

01:20.840 --> 01:22.340
                        - David,
           the Candy Man's here!

01:22.340 --> 01:25.180
       - Killing Bledsoe
       is your initiation

01:25.180 --> 01:27.580
            back to
   the Order of Everlasting.

01:27.580 --> 01:29.350
           - [groans]
            - Maria!

01:29.350 --> 01:32.220
             - No!
 - What is that power she has?

01:32.220 --> 01:34.390
   - She has a spirit inside her
             you cannot imagine.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.560
      - I'm ready to spend
    some time with someone.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.430
       - I want to, but I'm just
                  not ready yet.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.760
                  - Crazy things
            are happening to me.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.830
        I need to know the truth
                about my mother.

01:43.830 --> 01:46.330
       <i> - Grace, you are</i>
    <i> the most perfect thing</i>

01:46.340 --> 01:48.140
       <i> I have ever seen.</i>

01:48.140 --> 01:51.170
    - Stay away from David.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.310
           - I think I'm in love
                       with her.

01:52.310 --> 01:54.780
- You just made
the biggest mistake.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.310
- The rune is the mark
of an angel.

01:57.310 --> 01:59.550
     <i> - Grace is an angel.</i>

01:59.550 --> 02:01.620
    <i> - Maria's strong enough</i>
        <i> to defeat Enos.</i>

02:01.620 --> 02:04.220
         <i> - She's not.</i>
     <i> We need both of them.</i>

02:04.220 --> 02:07.290
      <i> Devil and the angel</i>
         <i> to stop Enos.</i>

02:09.690 --> 02:12.730
     - What is this place?
     - You're in Purgatory.

02:12.730 --> 02:15.200
- Think of this place
as a hole in the room.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.360
         - I love her.
        - I know you do.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.770
       - Who do you think
       you're protecting?

02:18.770 --> 02:19.870
                   - All of you.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.600
- When I met Elijah,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.640
I was already married.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.170
             - Mom?

02:25.170 --> 02:27.210
- You three are the only ones
that can stop him!

02:27.210 --> 02:29.710
The Trinity,
blood of my blood!

02:29.710 --> 02:32.780
Come give Mommy a kiss.

02:32.780 --> 02:37.620
             - There's something
               you need to know.

02:37.620 --> 02:41.660
  <i> - And this message, Davie,</i>
       <i> is just for you.</i>

02:43.460 --> 02:44.460
          <i> - You, sir.</i>

02:44.460 --> 02:46.360
     <i> [cheers and applause]</i>

02:46.360 --> 02:49.660
        I have a feeling
 he's going to do great things.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.230
       <i> - Take life now!</i>
        <i> Take life now!</i>

02:52.230 --> 02:54.330
         <i> all chanting:</i>
 <i> Take life now! Take life now!</i>

02:54.340 --> 02:56.300
            - Mom said something
                  about Trinity.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.770
- Angel, demon.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.710
       - So what's David?
         - He's human.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.180
- Promise me
you won't let me die

03:02.180 --> 03:04.710
if I do this for you.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.580
- Enos wants
to make a deal.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.520
- If I go back now,
it's a death sentence.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.180
         - What if Enos can make
               all that go away?

03:10.190 --> 03:12.320
          Wipe the record clean.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.620
           - A demon?
           - Abigail.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.260
     - You can control her?
          - Sometimes.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.890
          - Where's this retreat
             supposed to happen?

03:18.890 --> 03:20.490
           - Where do you think?

03:20.500 --> 03:21.860
       - Sangolo's where
        it all started,

03:21.860 --> 03:23.460
        and that's where
        it's gonna end.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.600
- If you got
trouble coming,

03:24.600 --> 03:27.530
I wanna be there
when it happens.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.440
  <i> - As you enter the retreat,</i>

03:29.440 --> 03:32.270
 you may become separated from
the parties you've arrived with.

03:32.270 --> 03:34.940
     - Where'd everyone go?
           [screams]

03:34.940 --> 03:36.580
       - Open this door!

03:36.580 --> 03:37.910
     - What's so important
       on the other side?

03:37.910 --> 03:39.350
- My daughter.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.720
      <i> all: Take life now!</i>

03:41.720 --> 03:44.320
                - I have to find
                David and Grace.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.960
- Don't you remember those
early days at Everlasting?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.660
               - Snap out of it.

03:49.660 --> 03:51.360
- [screams]

03:51.360 --> 03:52.690
                          - Die!

03:54.630 --> 03:55.730
            [cheers]

03:55.730 --> 03:56.930
       - Don't touch her!

03:56.930 --> 03:58.670
            - Dusty!
            - Maria!

03:58.670 --> 04:01.240
     [indistinct chanting]

04:04.510 --> 04:06.310
     - What have you done?

04:06.310 --> 04:08.640
   - The same thing you would
have done if you had the chance.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.710
      We're finally going
    to be rid of each other.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.680
 - This isn't who I want to be.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.280
         Take it back!

04:14.280 --> 04:16.779
      - This bus is going
     straight to Purgatory.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.820
    - I used to be an old friend
                   of your boss.

04:19.820 --> 04:20.990
- Can you save my daughter?

04:20.990 --> 04:22.490
                 - Why should I?

04:22.490 --> 04:23.990
- I'll give you my soul.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.760
30 minutes to try to save her,

04:25.760 --> 04:28.600
and I'll serve you and Enos
in hell till the end of time.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.830
  - Wasn't Dusty just a little
      too good to be true?

04:31.830 --> 04:34.570
         Welcome home.

04:34.570 --> 04:35.770

     <i> David: All this time,</i>

04:45.010 --> 04:49.050

       <i> We'd been living</i>

05:12.740 --> 05:15.410

05:15.410 --> 05:20.480
  - It breaks my heart to see
  anybody so unhappy, so lost.

         - [whimpering]

05:21.920 --> 05:24.580
      - This is my family.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.320
     My precious daughter,
          Maria, yes.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.990
       She has a darkness
          within her.

05:30.990 --> 05:35.430
     A cancer of the soul.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.000
       And it's holding her back

05:37.000 --> 05:40.900
               from reaching her
                 full potential.

          - [panting]

05:42.740 --> 05:47.770

            to rip that darkness

05:47.780 --> 05:49.380
       right out of my daughter!

05:49.380 --> 05:51.980

        to make her whole again.

05:51.980 --> 05:53.050

05:53.050 --> 05:54.920
             - Shh.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.550
  Darling, don't be so tedious
   and accept the inevitable.

05:58.550 --> 06:01.090
     - You see that, folks?

06:01.090 --> 06:05.390
  My Maria is so full of shame

06:05.390 --> 06:06.790
she can't even look at herself.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.130
      She needs our help,

06:08.130 --> 06:10.530
         and I can feel
       the will to change

I'll have another.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.880

I'm good for everything.

            - Oh, David Abascal,
                    look at you.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.660
  - Oh, you know, I was ready
     to tear your eyes out

08:50.660 --> 08:52.690
         when you first
   walked through that door.

08:52.690 --> 08:54.530
- Baby, I deserved it
for trying to walk out

08:54.530 --> 08:56.130
on a gorgeous creature
like you.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.630
                 - I like having
               my old baby back.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.800
- Does this look like
the old David to you?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.540
           - Mm, no, it doesn't.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.170
          What are you on, coke?
                           Addy?

09:04.170 --> 09:06.310
- No, no, no, no, darling,
you got it all wrong.

09:06.310 --> 09:09.110
Have you heard about
this A&O thing?

09:09.110 --> 09:10.910
        - What is that,
   one of those Tony Robbins,

09:10.910 --> 09:12.550
    self-help kinda things?

09:12.550 --> 09:14.850
- I know, sounds like
bullshit, right?

09:14.850 --> 09:17.680
But I'm telling you, it made
a brand-new man outta me.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.990
I do what I want,
take what I want,

09:19.990 --> 09:21.290
and I've never felt better.

09:21.290 --> 09:24.060
         - Oh, you make
        that sound hot.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.330
                   - I could use
                a little of that

09:25.330 --> 09:27.160
        to help get our business
                  back together.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.800
             'Cause Sweetmouth's
           been a little lacking

09:28.800 --> 09:30.260
                since his run-in
                  with the Sons.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.030
- Where is my good friend?

09:32.030 --> 09:34.270
         - Wholesalers have been
   getting cute with our supply.

09:34.270 --> 09:36.670
        Sometimes I swear we may
      as well be working retail.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.000
- But what's stopping you

09:38.010 --> 09:39.640
from getting your very own
piece of the action?

09:39.640 --> 09:41.940
You're the brains.
You don't need Sweetmouth.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.310
                 - He'd kill me.

09:43.310 --> 09:45.680
- You don't have to be afraid
of him anymore.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.150
You don't have
to be afraid of anything.

09:47.150 --> 09:49.850
That's the whole point.
Just try it.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.150
A&O has a big retreat
going on right now,

09:52.150 --> 09:53.890
I'm telling you.

09:53.890 --> 09:56.020
  - I am tired of being under
       my daddy's thumb.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.090
- Or Sweetmouth's thumb.

09:58.090 --> 10:01.600
We combine our full potential,
there's nothing we can't do

10:01.600 --> 10:03.260
or have.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.800
       - Oh, I knew from
       that first moment

10:05.800 --> 10:08.670
  I saw you robbing my house,
          I loved you.

10:08.670 --> 10:12.070
- Yeah, well,

10:34.100 --> 10:38.300
- She's finally gone, Mar.

10:38.300 --> 10:42.270
You don't need Abigail anymore,
and we're home now.

10:42.270 --> 10:44.670
The family is coming back
together.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.410
               - Don't touch me.

10:46.410 --> 10:49.280
- Please, Mar.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.180
- How are you, princess?

10:51.180 --> 10:54.050
     - You son of a bitch,
         I'll kill you!

10:54.050 --> 10:55.850
          - Come here.
             - Shh.

10:55.850 --> 10:58.280
- Not without Abigail,
you can't.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.320
David, why don't you go check
on our new recruits?

11:01.320 --> 11:05.860
I think Mariah and I need
a little daddy/daughter time.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.800
       [thunder rumbling]

11:12.170 --> 11:15.100
                 You're willful,
                you always were,

11:15.100 --> 11:17.170
                and there's just
                no pleasing you.

11:17.170 --> 11:19.210
         First, you're mad about
                 having a demon.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.310
                 Then you're mad
          when I get rid of her.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.310
         Say you want a nice guy
             who will accept you

11:23.310 --> 11:25.280
                    and love you
             for what you are...

11:25.280 --> 11:27.180
- And now you want
to kill me?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.950
           - Who are you really?

11:30.950 --> 11:34.950
- I told you,
the war made me do things.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.720
Made me hurt people,
not just the enemy.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.230
The MPs decided to make
an example out of me.

11:40.230 --> 11:41.930
My sentence was death,

11:41.930 --> 11:43.700
so I prayed
to whoever was listening

11:43.700 --> 11:45.070
and made a deal.

11:45.070 --> 11:49.100
Enos's spirit needed
a new body, a host.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.900
                  - You bastard.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.410
- You felt loved.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.840
How many people are lucky enough
to ever really have that?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.910
               - I believed you.
                  I didn't know.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.780
             - 'Cause you didn't
                   want to know.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.480
                 Now, be honest.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.880
  <i> Wasn't Dusty just a little</i>
     <i> too good to be true?</i>

12:03.890 --> 12:06.090

                       cool car,
         and I know how to cook?

12:08.090 --> 12:09.960
- I make a mean fish stew.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.190
          - You coming on to me?

12:11.190 --> 12:12.460
                 - I always knew
                 where you were,

12:12.460 --> 12:14.230
          but you never bothered
                     to ask why.

12:14.230 --> 12:15.730
I'm coming with you.

12:15.730 --> 12:18.130
         You believed it because
                  you wanted to.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.930
 <i> But don't feel bad, princess.</i>

12:19.940 --> 12:21.230
         You know what they say.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.240
- Girls always wind up
marrying their father.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.970
             - Get away from me!

12:25.970 --> 12:28.370
  - Come on, open your heart.
             - Aah!

12:28.380 --> 12:30.910
- Where are you going, Maria?
You can't leave.

12:30.910 --> 12:34.810
You're on an island.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.950
 - Why don't you just kill me?

12:37.950 --> 12:42.060
- I would never kill you
or David.

12:42.060 --> 12:45.330
Like I told you,
this is about love.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.390
I want my family
back again.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.030
             - What about Grace?

12:50.030 --> 12:51.930
                    And Bledsoe?

12:51.930 --> 12:54.770
- Your Uncle Elijah
and your half-sister,

12:54.770 --> 12:55.940
they're--
how shall I say this?

12:55.940 --> 12:59.340
They're extended family.

12:59.340 --> 13:03.380
Like I said, I would never
spill the blood of my blood,

13:03.380 --> 13:05.350

             - Now?

13:32.370 --> 13:33.540

       you're a ladies' man now?

14:34.600 --> 14:36.440

      through the motions?

14:36.440 --> 14:37.970

      dulling your brain?

14:37.970 --> 14:39.910

                    - I can't.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.730
- So what do you say
we all make the most

35:00.730 --> 35:02.490
of his last precious minutes?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.660
              - That's more time
               than you'll have!

35:04.670 --> 35:07.200
            This ends right now.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.470
- Come and get it!

35:10.440 --> 35:13.570
          So wonderful
     to see you all again.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.510
                          - Mom?

35:15.510 --> 35:20.250
    - That smells heavenly,
            darling.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.710
        Doesn't she look
        just fantastic?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.820
- Oh, thank you, honey.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.660
Please, sit.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.230
           - This can't be real.

35:35.230 --> 35:37.730
       I watched you get dragged
              away down in hell.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.230
You're dead.

35:39.230 --> 35:41.170
- She's as alive
as you are, princess.

35:41.170 --> 35:42.530
For now.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.600
But if you three
pull the plug on me,

35:44.610 --> 35:46.270
then Mommy goes too,

35:46.270 --> 35:48.440
and you don't want to lose
her again, do you, kids?

35:48.440 --> 35:49.670
              - You're a coward.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.580
- You've won.
The Trinity is complete.

35:51.580 --> 35:54.850
Now all I'm asking for
is a final request.

35:54.850 --> 35:58.450
Can't we all just have one last
meal together as a real family?

35:58.450 --> 36:00.320
          - Screw you!
           - David--

36:00.320 --> 36:02.620
- Honey, I just need to look at
 my babies a little bit longer.

36:02.620 --> 36:03.760
- Okay.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.490
     - Please, sit, Maria.

36:06.490 --> 36:08.860
        David, darling.

36:09.930 --> 36:11.230
Gracie.

36:11.230 --> 36:12.400
                    - The second
              he tries anything,

36:12.400 --> 36:13.470
                we take him out.

36:13.470 --> 36:14.600
            You know what to do.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.470
           - Gracie.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.810
         - Right by me.

36:21.810 --> 36:26.380
                 - And Elijah...

36:26.380 --> 36:27.850
            you look as handsome
                      as you did

36:27.850 --> 36:32.280
        the day our little angel
                       was born.

36:32.290 --> 36:35.450
- I dreamed about seeing you
again since the day you left.

36:35.460 --> 36:39.260
    I took the cloth hoping that
   would be my reward in Heaven.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.730
     I'm not ready to leave yet.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.630
       - Don't be afraid
     of what's coming next.

36:42.630 --> 36:46.970
     Enos showed me a world
 without worry or consequence.

36:46.970 --> 36:50.640
        A world of bliss
        and tranquility.

36:50.640 --> 36:54.270
    The most beautiful thing
        I've ever seen.

36:54.270 --> 36:57.310
- That's right, my love.

36:57.310 --> 36:59.840
         - It's a lie.

36:59.850 --> 37:02.580
      - Please don't call
      your mother a liar.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.980
Now...

37:04.990 --> 37:08.290
     who likes theirs rare?

37:08.290 --> 37:10.520
        - I missed this,

37:10.520 --> 37:13.630
      all of us together.

37:13.630 --> 37:16.760
- Mom.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.400
Have you forgotten
what he did to you?

37:20.400 --> 37:23.900
         <i> [dark music]</i>

37:23.900 --> 37:25.740
He hurt you.

37:25.740 --> 37:29.440
He hurt all of us.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.880
      - This isn't right.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.580
Mom, this is just the evil
he put inside you.

37:33.580 --> 37:36.850
This is your fear talking,
your demon.

37:36.850 --> 37:39.620
    - Can't we all just try
     and enjoy this moment?

37:39.620 --> 37:42.450
- Just like when we all used
to pretend we couldn't hear it

37:42.460 --> 37:44.390
whenever Dad beat
the hell out of you?

37:44.390 --> 37:45.990
  - David, Maria, that's not--

37:45.990 --> 37:48.690
  - I warned you not to upset
your mother at the dinner table.

37:48.700 --> 37:52.800
  My God, do you children have
any idea how spoiled you sound?

37:52.800 --> 37:55.300
        "Mommy and Daddy
        were fighting."

37:55.300 --> 37:56.840
  I gave you kids everything,

37:56.840 --> 37:58.540
          the keys to
     the whole damn world!

37:58.540 --> 38:00.670
             - I never asked you
                   for anything!

38:00.670 --> 38:02.710
- No, you just took it all
and ran,

38:02.710 --> 38:04.340
you ungrateful little tramp.

38:04.340 --> 38:06.280
- You say one more word
about my sister--

38:06.280 --> 38:07.650
- And you'll do what,

38:07.650 --> 38:09.380
stab her in the back again?

38:09.380 --> 38:11.350
And don't cry to me
about hearing your mother

38:11.350 --> 38:13.320
get taught a lesson,
just because you didn't

38:13.320 --> 38:15.350
have the balls
to do anything about it.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.660
             - I'm twice the man
                  you ever were.

38:17.660 --> 38:19.020
    - Is that true, Gracie?

38:19.030 --> 38:20.590
- You bastard!
Aghh!

38:20.590 --> 38:21.930
             - Dad.
            - Uh-oh.

38:21.930 --> 38:23.800
                 Your 30 minutes
                 are up, Elijah,

38:23.800 --> 38:27.930
   which means time's up for you
          and your little angel.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.930
Bye-bye, Trinity.

         - We need you!

38:39.750 --> 38:40.880
             - No!
          - Go, Grace.

38:40.880 --> 38:44.080
            - Grace!
       - Go. I love you.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.740
               - It's all right.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.980
- I can't believe
we did it.

39:46.980 --> 39:48.750
- Almost too easy.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.420
           - Hold up.
          - Charlotte.

39:50.420 --> 39:52.450
                - Be quiet, son.

39:52.450 --> 39:55.550
       So, Miss Roberts has just
           told me quite a story

39:55.560 --> 39:58.860
                about what it is
                you Abascals do.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.990
        I'm not gonna pretend to
  understand what happened here.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.960
             I just want to know
                 that it's over.

40:04.970 --> 40:08.600
           - I hope,
       but I'm not sure.

40:12.170 --> 40:14.440
        - Are you okay?

40:14.440 --> 40:17.110
        - Are you, um...
     are you normal again?

40:17.110 --> 40:20.750
- Yeah, I think so.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.610
What happened to
Diversity?

40:22.620 --> 40:26.150
      - She and Sweetmouth
          disappeared.

40:26.150 --> 40:28.120
- Nothing ever ends.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.990
              - There's gonna be
              a lot of questions

40:29.990 --> 40:31.790
           once the state police
                        show up.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.760
         Might be best if you're
         not here to answer 'em.

          Come on, we'll get you
