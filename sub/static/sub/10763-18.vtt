WEBVTT

00:09.409 --> 00:13.113
And one of those cinnamon buns
please, extra frosting.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.104
Oh, here they are. Hey.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.117
Hi, you guys.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.108
We were so excited when
you guys asked us out.

00:19.419 --> 00:22.122
You're like the A-list couple
in Lamaze class.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.123
Well, that's good
to hear.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.125
We were afraid we
were in the C-Section.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.683
(chuckling)

00:27.093 --> 00:29.195
We bring our own food
everywhere.

00:29.195 --> 00:32.186
Sandy doesn't put anything
unhealthy in her body.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.490
No refined sugar,
white flour, or gluten.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.136
I'm sure you're the same.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.433
Oh, of course.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.139
Cinnamon bun.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.436
No, thank you.
I'm pregnant.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.709
- But you...
- I said no.

00:44.110 --> 00:47.213
Sweetie, this is your
best yam loaf yet.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.516
He's a saint.
He cooks my food,

00:49.516 --> 00:51.217
rubs cocoa butter
on my belly...

00:51.217 --> 00:52.519
I just wish I could

00:52.519 --> 00:54.214
go through
the birth for her.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.525
Hey, what are you guys
doing with your placenta?

00:58.525 --> 01:00.527
Ours will nourish
the roots

01:00.527 --> 01:02.222
of a special tree
we plant in our yard.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.533
Well, we live in
an apartment.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.535
Although that ficusin the study

01:08.535 --> 01:10.236
is looking a tad droopy.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.238
By the way,

01:12.238 --> 01:13.227
if you need a doula...

01:13.540 --> 01:15.542
Cindy, I'm sure they
already have one.

01:15.542 --> 01:16.543
Everybody has a doula.

01:16.543 --> 01:19.245
BRAD:
Ours is a treasure.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.248
She'll be there through the
whole delivery, you know,

01:22.248 --> 01:24.546
focusing our energies,
giving us emotional support.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.253
I don't know how people
do it without one.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.555
She's really helped Brad.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.257
He's having a really
tough sympathy pregnancy.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.559
Oh, boy.

01:32.559 --> 01:33.560
Honey?

01:33.560 --> 01:34.561
I'm just...

01:34.561 --> 01:37.263
I'm feeling a little sick again
I'm sorry.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.252
I just
need some air.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.268
We're so in sync.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.270
He feels everything
I'm feeling.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.272
Nausea, weight gain,
food cravings.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.274
You know,
in psychological terms,

01:48.274 --> 01:49.434
that's called
Couvade Syndrome.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.835
We just call it love.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.618
I don't like them.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.688
They're getting so much more
out of this than we are.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.178
We don't even
have a placenta plan.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.693
No, wait--
let's not panic.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.193
All we need
is expert help.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.196
We'll hire one of
those doula people.

02:10.196 --> 02:11.698
I'll get the number from Brad.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.700
Sorry. Sorry.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.192
Oh, this pregnancy
is taking it

02:17.704 --> 02:19.272
out of me.

02:19.272 --> 02:22.842
My breasts
are so tender today.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.344
You know what?

02:24.344 --> 02:26.778
I'm starting
to feel a bit nauseous.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.229 --> 02:45.720
(rattling)

02:46.232 --> 02:46.721
Oh.

02:47.233 --> 02:47.722
WOMAN:
Hi.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.724
Welcome to
Charlotte's Web:

02:50.236 --> 02:51.738
A Matchmaking Service.
Come in.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.239
I'm sorry...
Isn't this...?

02:53.239 --> 02:54.741
Oh, I see what happened.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.730
I must have been so
engrossed in my paper

02:56.242 --> 02:57.243
I went
right past my floor.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.745
Of course.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.235
It can be a little
embarrassing to admit

03:00.747 --> 03:02.248
you need help
in the romance department.

03:02.248 --> 03:03.416
Please, come in.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.485
No, this was
a mistake.

03:05.485 --> 03:06.486
I understand.

03:06.486 --> 03:09.182
Come in.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.491
Trust me, you are
comically incorrect.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.186
I do not need a matchmaker.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.894
So you're married?

03:14.894 --> 03:15.895
No.

03:15.895 --> 03:16.896
Dating someone?

03:16.896 --> 03:18.398
I date plenty.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.900
In fact, I often need
the proverbial stick

03:20.900 --> 03:22.390
one uses to beat
women off with.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.392
I...

03:27.407 --> 03:29.398
I believe my point is made.

03:29.676 --> 03:30.777
Why don't you
just take my card?

03:30.777 --> 03:31.778
I don't
need your card.

03:31.778 --> 03:32.779
In case you
change your mind.

03:32.779 --> 03:33.768
I won't
change my mind.

03:34.280 --> 03:34.769
For a friend.
I have no friends.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.341
... who are in need
of your services.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.477
You see, I am a bit
of a local celebrity,

03:40.987 --> 03:42.978
so I have no trouble
getting dates.

03:43.489 --> 03:44.357
Really?
Yes.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.625
What's your name?

03:45.625 --> 03:47.327
Dr. Frasier Crane.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.695
Oh.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.596
Sorry, doesn't ring any bells.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.467
Frasier Crane?

03:54.467 --> 03:55.468
Why, yes it is.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.971
Well, my God, what are
you doing here?

03:57.971 --> 04:00.473
Well, actually, I have
an office one floor down.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.976
Really?
I'm on 1 8.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.478
Oh, well why don't
I ride up with you,

04:05.478 --> 04:06.479
I could use
the exercise.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.470
Bye, bye.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.850
It's so funny
seeing you here.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.853
It's funny for you
, delightful for me.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.355
It's always nice to meet a fan,

04:15.355 --> 04:16.344
especially one
so attractive.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.348
You don't remember me?

04:20.860 --> 04:22.862
Yes, of course
I remember you.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.365
It's you.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.366
Hey, you.

04:26.366 --> 04:29.869
I can't believe
you don't remember.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.371
We dated.

04:31.371 --> 04:32.872
Three times.

04:32.872 --> 04:33.873
Jennifer.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.875
Ellie.
Ellie!

04:35.875 --> 04:36.864
Oh, well,
here's your floor.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.378
Nice catching
up with you.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.369
Oh, brushing me off.
That sounds familiar.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.917
Oh, not that I'm
surprised you forgot me.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.920
You spent every day
talking about yourself,

04:47.920 --> 04:50.390
and then, after
we slept together...

04:50.390 --> 04:50.981
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.492
But you could've
called me!

04:52.492 --> 04:53.982
Sorry!
Again, so sorry.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.611
FRASIER:
And so it seems

05:11.611 --> 05:15.014
I have dated every
woman in Seattle.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.505
The well is dry.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.019
The cupboard is bare.

05:20.019 --> 05:23.420
There are no more
fish in the sea.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.327
Meanwhile, my dad is engaged.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.329
My brother is expecting
his first child.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.331
While I am left
to spin aimlessly

05:31.331 --> 05:33.561
on the dating hamster wheel.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.772
You like your metaphors,
don't you?

05:39.772 --> 05:42.408
Well, don't
worry, Frasier.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.977
Somewhere in Seattle there's
a woman you haven't pissed off

05:44.977 --> 05:46.379
and I'm going to find her.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.870
am.
You seem awfully
sure of yourself.I

05:49.515 --> 05:50.504
I've successfully matched

05:50.817 --> 05:51.951
hundreds of couples,

05:51.951 --> 05:53.953
so...

05:53.953 --> 05:58.958
What kind of woman
are you looking for?

05:58.958 --> 06:01.828
And don't just say smart, sexyand sophisticated.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.429
Why, don't you
have any of those?

06:03.429 --> 06:05.431
All right.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.500
Well, it's
hard to say...

06:07.500 --> 06:10.503
what I want.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.639
It's been so long since I've
really fallen for someone.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.109
You know that
feeling you get

06:16.109 --> 06:17.974
after a first date,
when you can't even sleep,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.079
you just lie
there in bed awake,

06:20.079 --> 06:23.516
thinking about her?

06:23.516 --> 06:26.386
That's what I want.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.786
You're going to make me work
for my money, aren't you?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.754
Uh, by the way,

06:31.457 --> 06:32.692
I do require
a payment up-front.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.093
Oh, of course.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.027
My fee is $1 0, 000.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.434
That's awfully steep.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.436
And those ten years
of bad dates,

06:43.436 --> 06:45.171
how much did they run you?

06:45.171 --> 06:47.002
I'll write you a check.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.544
So I gave her the money

06:51.544 --> 06:52.845
and I filled out
the questionnaire.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.540
Mm.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.549
You fudged a little bit
on your answers, right?

06:56.549 --> 06:57.846
No, of course not.
Why would I?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.720
Because nobody's
honest on those things.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.455
There's a code people use.

07:02.455 --> 07:05.491
Like "mature"
means old.

07:05.491 --> 07:08.561
"Athletic" means
flat-chested.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.062
And, uh, oh...

07:10.062 --> 07:13.065
"not model thin"
means circus fat.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.567
Well, gosh.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.570
She's already sent me out
on a date this evening.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.505
But I assure you,
I am more interested

07:19.505 --> 07:21.598
in personality than looks.

07:21.908 --> 07:22.909
Did you see
a photo at least?

07:22.909 --> 07:23.898
Of course
I saw a photo.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.601
She's got a personality you
can bounce a quarter off of.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.049
So where you taking her?

07:30.049 --> 07:30.981
Claret--
I intend to take

07:31.484 --> 07:32.485
all subsequent dates
there as well.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.487
That way I can compare
them objectively, you see.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.977
As the woman will
be the only variable.

07:36.489 --> 07:37.490
It's basic science.

07:37.490 --> 07:38.591
Yeah.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.183
That's been
your dating problem--

07:40.693 --> 07:41.557
not enough science.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.497
Hey, you two.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.988
Here, have a seat.
There you are.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.002
We can only chat for a moment.
We're meeting our doula.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.003
Oh, yes.

07:51.003 --> 07:51.992
Your doula.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.706
Anybody need
anything?

07:53.706 --> 07:54.774
I'm getting more coffee.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.075
DAPHNE:
No, thanks.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.176
We brought fennel tea

07:57.176 --> 07:59.679
and some healthy
snacks to nibble on.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.181
Oh, huh. Peanut butter and carrots.

08:02.181 --> 08:04.183
Looks like somebody
has some pregnancy cravings.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.172
Yes, I just
can't help myself.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.623
Oh, dear, Niles.
Couvade Syndrome?

08:10.623 --> 08:12.682
We just call it love.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.695
Yes, well...
I have a date.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.698
I've signed up with
a matchmaking service.

08:18.698 --> 08:19.699
Wait, Frasier,
a matchmaker?

08:19.699 --> 08:21.701
I'm surprised you'
d use a professional

08:21.701 --> 08:23.168
for something as personal
as your love life.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.171
Well, I could say
the same thing

08:25.171 --> 08:26.672
about you and your doula.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.174
Well, our professional
comes highly recommended.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.176
So does my professional.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.677
Well, our professional is
at the top of her field.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.666
As is mine.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.669
Well, our professional
charges $200 an hour.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.169
Mine charges $ 1 0, 000.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.688
She sounds fantastic.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.690
Congratulations,
Frasier.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.679
Thank you, Niles.
Wish me luck!

08:46.192 --> 08:47.682
Good luck. Wow.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.684
Daphne and Niles?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.198
Oh, you must
be Harvest.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.700
So nice to meet you.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.190
Oh, this
is our friend Roz.

08:56.702 --> 08:57.703
Hi.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.206
A resume detailing my
1 5 years of experience,

09:00.206 --> 09:02.708
plus a syllabus
for further reading.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.279
Well, I am doula impressed.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.847
HARVEST:
Now, on page five,

09:07.847 --> 09:10.543
you'll find details
about my support staff.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.552
There's a masseuse,
a shaman, of course,

09:12.552 --> 09:13.853
and a drummer.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.844
He used to tour with
the Doobie Brothers.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.558
Very talented.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.560
My, sounds expensive.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.551
I can't wait to tell Frasier.

09:22.862 --> 09:23.863
And of course, I insist on

09:23.863 --> 09:25.231
a drug-free birthing environment.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.100
Whoa. Back up. No drugs?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.590
Oh, I want Daphne
to be awake

09:30.102 --> 09:31.604
and connected
to the moment.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.873
A natural childbirth
needn't be painful.

09:33.873 --> 09:37.206
It needn't be,
but it be.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.201
How painful?

09:40.713 --> 09:42.214
Would you have a tooth
pulled without Novocain?

09:42.214 --> 09:43.716
No.

09:43.716 --> 09:47.208
Well, a tooth
is this big.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.721
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.723
I thought you wanted
to be emotionally present

09:50.723 --> 09:52.625
for the birth
of your baby,

09:52.625 --> 09:54.024
but I see that
you just want

09:54.727 --> 09:55.716
somebody
to dope you up,

09:56.028 --> 09:58.030
strap you down
and yank it out.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.019
Oh, no, no. Wait. Don't go.

09:59.732 --> 10:00.666
Yes, our friend

10:00.666 --> 10:01.767
was just leaving.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.735
All right.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.303
You're right. I'm sorry.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.305
This is a private matter.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.296
You need to do
what's right for you.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.199
Ow!

10:09.709 --> 10:10.698
Times a million.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.843
FRASIER:
Here we are.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.254
WOMAN:
Thank you.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.623
There's something
wonderful

10:23.623 --> 10:25.124
about first dates,
isn't there?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.626
Oh, thank you
very much.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.129
That tingle of anticipation
as two perfect strangers

10:30.129 --> 10:33.121
march toward endless vistas
of possibility.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.634
Well put, Frasier.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.135
Oh, well
thank you.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.637
And what do you do?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.639
I'm a science teacher.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.628
Ah, serendipity.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.675
I'm a science man myself.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.973
I suppose that's why Charlotte
got the two of us together.

10:45.678 --> 10:46.667
Well then, what's your field?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.681
Well, my field is biology,

10:48.681 --> 10:50.683
but my specialty
is creationism.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.685
Oh, well, I find that...

10:52.685 --> 10:54.320
Excuse me?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.821
You know,
they're only in first grade,

10:55.821 --> 10:57.323
so they don't understand
everything,

10:57.323 --> 10:59.191
but Brother William,
he's our leader,

10:59.191 --> 11:01.819
he likes us
to get them

11:02.161 --> 11:04.163
started young before they
get their minds warped

11:04.163 --> 11:05.665
by all that fossil nonsense.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.656
Well, you know,
I-I realize that Darwin

11:08.167 --> 11:10.658
has his detractors, but to call
it nonsense seems a bit

11:11.170 --> 11:12.672
cavalier,
don't you think?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.162
Oh, dear.
You're one of those.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.677
You think we're
descended from apes?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.178
Well, not recently, no.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.180
Do I look like an ape to you?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.683
Do I have hairy palms
and a big hairy back?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.685
Would you like a drink?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
Oh, yeah. Bring it on.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.190
But I got to warn you--
I'm a horny drunk.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.192
Last Spring,
in Cabo,

11:33.192 --> 11:35.695
I wake up one morning
under a beach umbrella,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.686
stark naked,
tequila bottle in one hand,

11:38.197 --> 11:40.188
and some guy's
tightie-whities on my head.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.334
(chuckling)

11:42.334 --> 11:44.403
Whoa, don't
I know you from Cabo?

11:44.403 --> 11:45.392
(laughs)

11:45.905 --> 11:47.395
Remind you of anything?

11:47.907 --> 11:48.896
You wish, right?

11:51.911 --> 11:53.913
That's, uh, very amusing.

11:53.913 --> 11:56.404
So what do you do
for a living?

11:56.916 --> 11:58.406
Well, right now
I'm back in school.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.920
You see, I've loved animal
s my whole life

12:00.920 --> 12:03.422
so I figured, why not really
go for it, you know?

12:03.422 --> 12:04.924
So I'm going to become

12:04.924 --> 12:07.927
a taxidermist.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.929
Is something wrong?

12:09.929 --> 12:11.430
No.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.421
I was just, uh,
admiring your ensemble.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.924
Thanks. I made it myself.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.970
You know,

12:17.970 --> 12:19.772
I have a lot
of this fabric left.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.741
I could make you a shirt
with a matching hat.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.042
Don't go to any trouble.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.044
Would you like some wine?

12:25.044 --> 12:27.747
Nah, the cops took my fake I.D.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.750
and my dad'll kill me
if I get busted again.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.742
So what are you, like, 50?

12:37.256 --> 12:39.247
Something like that.

12:45.397 --> 12:46.398
Well, I'm off.

12:46.398 --> 12:47.900
No, you can't.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.835
Our doula's coming
specifically to meet
you and your father.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.837
She insists on knowing
all the members

12:51.837 --> 12:53.236
of the baby's
energy circle.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.408
Oh, what kind of a kook
is she anyway?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.144
Harvest is not a kook.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.513
She's assisted
at the birth

13:00.513 --> 13:02.515
of more
than 600 babies

13:02.515 --> 13:04.817
and two giant pandas.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.185
She better
get here quickly.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.186
I do have a date.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.888
Another one?

13:08.888 --> 13:10.456
You're doing fairly well
by this matchmaker.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.526
Oh, hardly. A monkey throwing
darts at the Seattle phone book

13:13.526 --> 13:15.528
would find me a better mate.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.521
Hell, a dart-throwing monkey
wouldbea better mate.

13:19.832 --> 13:20.924
Why don't you fire her?

13:21.433 --> 13:22.935
Don't think
I haven't considered it.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.926
If tonight's a bust, I'm goito
demand my money back.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.017
Niles...

13:38.017 --> 13:39.919
have you gained weight?

13:39.919 --> 13:41.011
Yes, but, you know,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.015
you always put on a lot
with your first baby.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.891
The hardest part

13:45.891 --> 13:47.459
is the mood swings.

13:47.459 --> 13:48.961
Jeez, Niles,

13:48.961 --> 13:50.963
don't you think
you're taking this

13:50.963 --> 13:52.965
sympathetic pregnancy
thing too far?

13:52.965 --> 13:56.969
I'm simply giving
in to the primal
cycle of life.

13:56.969 --> 13:59.338
I have no control
over it.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.241
In that case, get off my Chanel
couch before your water breaks.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.943
Oh, hello.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.244
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.246
Harvest Finkleman.
Delighted.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.949
Oh. Well, I'm sorry I can't stay.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.885
Niles and Daphne you know,
of course, and this is my dad,

14:12.885 --> 14:14.887
Martin Crane.
Ms. Finkleman-Delighted.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.555
Nice to meet you, Martin.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.357
Likewise.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.359
So are you planning
to participate

14:20.359 --> 14:22.094
in your grandchild's birth?

14:22.094 --> 14:23.896
Oh, no. I'm kind of old school.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.398
Clean the kid up,
slap a bow
on her head,

14:26.398 --> 14:28.889
then call me in.

14:29.335 --> 14:30.393
Oh! Guess who
had their baby.

14:30.903 --> 14:31.904
Brad and Cindy?

14:31.904 --> 14:33.895
Oh, I'm so
happy for them!

14:35.407 --> 14:38.978
He gets very
emotional lately.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.546
It was a beautiful experience.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.948
I made a tape,
if you'd like to see it.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.109
I would like to not see it.

14:45.484 --> 14:49.054
No, no! This would be
good for us-- play it.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.043
It was
an 1 8-hour labor.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.558
This should be
about two hours into it.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.059
I'm so excited.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.161
Daphne, I can't wait
until this is us.

14:56.161 --> 14:59.130
(Cindy screaming on tape)

14:59.331 --> 15:01.100
Oh, look at Cindy glow.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.268
CINDY:
Mother of God!

15:02.268 --> 15:04.236
Just kill me!

15:06.605 --> 15:09.108
(Cindy screaming on tape)

15:09.108 --> 15:11.975
She seems like
she's in a little pain.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.583
That's a boat load of fear.

15:17.583 --> 15:23.022
CINDY: Stop that drum before
I put your head through it!

15:23.022 --> 15:26.091
She laughed at that afterwards.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.060
I've seen enough.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.561
Wait, wait.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.064
You'll see how Cindy
pushes through the pain.

15:32.064 --> 15:33.432
I'm not pushing
through anything.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.335
I'm having my baby
the way God intended--

15:36.335 --> 15:39.031
in a hospital,
numb from the waist down.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.074
Now take
your incense

15:42.074 --> 15:44.065
and your woo-woo
stick and get out.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.478
And you,
stop acting pregnant.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.412
You're a man, for God sakes.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.028
Charlotte,
where's my date?

16:03.028 --> 16:06.031
I am so sorry.
She just called.
She had to cancel.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.032
That does it.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.021
No. We'll find
another evening.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.335
No, Charlotte,
we will not.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.030
You have sent me
on enough

16:11.337 --> 16:13.038
miserable dates,
thank you.

16:13.038 --> 16:17.031
Before you fix me up with
a doll-collecting war criminal

16:17.343 --> 16:20.335
or a hashish-smoking
burger flipper, I want out.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.348
And I want my money back.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.976
Frasier, this...

16:26.986 --> 16:29.284
this is a process.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.648
I have only sent you out
on five dates.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.526
Do you cure your patients
in five sessions?

16:34.526 --> 16:36.195
Well, no, but...

16:36.195 --> 16:37.355
This client roster

16:37.629 --> 16:39.698
is filled
with fascinating women.

16:39.698 --> 16:42.468
I just signed a new
one this morning--

16:42.468 --> 16:45.537
botany professor, avid
bicycle rider, very striking.

16:45.537 --> 16:46.538
But you know what?

16:46.538 --> 16:48.529
If you're going
to be so impatient,

16:49.041 --> 16:50.542
then we should
just end this now.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.177
I'll write
you a check.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.166
Well, wait.
No, no, no.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.581
I'm sure you'?
I do much better
on your own.

16:55.581 --> 16:59.618
With $ 1 0, 000, you can
download a lot of love.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.154
Well, let's not be too hasty.

17:02.154 --> 17:07.182
That striking, biking botanist
sounded like me.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.123
- I don't know.
- Please?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.157
Don't beg. It's a turnoff.

17:12.431 --> 17:13.832
All right.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.701
Why don't I get us some drinks,

17:15.701 --> 17:17.703
and then we
can talk about
our next move?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.694
Great.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.358
He's a big radio star.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.360
Smart, really sweet.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.055
So think about it.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.351
Here's my card.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.065
You lied to me.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.054
You have five clients.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.368
There is no roster
of eligible women!

17:49.368 --> 17:51.070
You looked in
my client log?

17:51.070 --> 17:55.074
t.
Yes. I've seen your log,
and I've dated every toad on i

17:55.074 --> 17:56.842
Is this the guy?

17:56.842 --> 17:57.831
No, no, no.
Different guy. Call me.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.515
I think the police
might be interested

18:03.515 --> 18:04.504
in this little
scam of yours.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.718
It is not a scam.

18:06.718 --> 18:09.788
I... I just didn't have time
to put the other pictures in.

18:09.788 --> 18:12.791
And I will not work one second
with someone who threatens me.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.226
I'll mail
you a check.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.228
I'll save you
the price of a stamp.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.730
I'll see you
at your office tomorrow.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.221
Fine. I'd say come alone,
but that's a given.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.127
Oh!

18:29.341 --> 18:32.845
Oh, God! What
a crappy, crappy day!

18:32.845 --> 18:35.280
Charlotte, are you okay?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.849
I can't
give you a check.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.852
I've already..
.. I've already
spent the money

18:39.852 --> 18:41.687
on rent
and food and...

18:41.687 --> 18:43.489
...and these shoes.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.481
These stupid,
stupid shoes!

18:48.494 --> 18:50.485
Come on, now.
It's okay.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.187
.
No, it's not.
Nothing's okay

18:53.499 --> 18:55.200
I lied to you.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.503
I just started
this business.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.505
But I'm really good at what I do.

18:59.505 --> 19:03.208
I used to run the
biggest matchmaking
business in Chicago

19:03.208 --> 19:06.211
before I lost it to
my rotten ex-husband
in the divorce.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.214
Divorce? But you're
wearing a wedding ring.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.206
It's camouflage.

19:12.518 --> 19:17.222
It inspires
confidence.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.224
I mean, nobody
wants a matchmaker

19:19.224 --> 19:21.527
whose life's a mess.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.222
Like me!

19:25.164 --> 19:26.465
I'm divorced.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.168
My business
is a joke.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.470
I'm-I'm up t
o my ass in debt.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.972
I had to move in
with my mother.

19:33.972 --> 19:37.543
I am 35 years old,
and I am living with my mother.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.534
How pathetic is that?

19:42.548 --> 19:45.551
Well, I...
I've seen worse.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.553
You mentioned
something earlier

19:47.553 --> 19:49.248
about having a drink.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.290
Oh, believe me,
I will.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.560
If my mother hasn't
finished the bottle.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.827
I meant here.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.330
No, I really can't.
I've got to get home.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.332
I have paperwork.
I have calls to make.

20:00.332 --> 20:01.333
It's my treat.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.322
Double Scotch.

20:06.838 --> 20:10.330
So then I spent five
soul-sucking years
in advertising

20:10.842 --> 20:12.742
dreaming up slogans
for Crunchios.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.581
"Crunchios are a munchy with
your lunchy or your brunchy"

20:15.581 --> 20:16.715
That was you?

20:16.715 --> 20:18.283
Yeah.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.774
I felt better about myself
when I was pushing cigarettes.

20:21.286 --> 20:22.651
Then, one day,
I fixed up my boss

20:23.222 --> 20:25.357
with my friend, and they
ended up getting married.

20:25.357 --> 20:28.292
And thus
a career was born.

20:28.493 --> 20:31.463
What better way to make a living
than by helping people be happy?

20:31.463 --> 20:34.499
So does your old boss
toast you every year

20:34.499 --> 20:37.236
when he celebrates
his anniversary?

20:37.236 --> 20:42.341
.
Actually, he's a she now,
and my friend's kind of bitter

20:42.341 --> 20:44.002
But I got

20:44.343 --> 20:46.912
the hang of it
after that.

20:46.912 --> 20:51.008
Well, until I lost the business
and came here

20:51.483 --> 20:54.853
and moved in
with my crazy-ass mother.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.320
For what it's worth,

20:56.622 --> 20:59.391
it will get easier
living with her.

20:59.391 --> 21:00.959
Is that your
professional opinion?

21:00.959 --> 21:03.462
Actually, it's a personal one.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.364
My dad lives with me.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.431
No.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.899
Mm. 1 1 years.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.334
Yeah.
Yikes.

21:09.334 --> 21:12.437
It does take a while
to adjust to each other

21:12.437 --> 21:14.373
before you're
perfectly in sync.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.307
How long did that take?

21:15.307 --> 21:17.643
I'll let you know.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.845
Truth be told,

21:19.845 --> 21:22.381
I'm going to miss him
when he moves out.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.417
I was missing my mother
when I was in Chicago.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.817
Now I just wish she was missing.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.391
I didn't realize it was so late.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.693
Frank's waiting for me at home.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.395
Frank?

21:36.395 --> 21:38.397
My boyfriend.

21:38.397 --> 21:39.631
Oh. Serious?

21:39.631 --> 21:42.429
Yes, but he has
a fun-loving side, too.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.703
No, I meant the relationship.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.072
Do you lie awake nights
thinking about him?

21:47.072 --> 21:50.041
A little.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.412
It's still new, but I
have my fingers crossed.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.447
Well, good luck with it.

21:55.447 --> 21:56.748
Thank you.

21:56.748 --> 21:57.737
And, if you'll let me,

21:58.450 --> 21:59.751
I'm going to find
someone fantastic

21:59.751 --> 22:01.753
for you, too, Frasier,
because you deserve it.

22:01.753 --> 22:05.457
And because you have my $ 1 0, 000.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.755
Are you going to mention that
every time you see me?

22:27.879 --> 22:31.781
Damn.
