10:58.290 --> 11:00.192
[ALL WHISTLING]

11:00.192 --> 11:03.295
ONE OF US HAS
TO REPRESENT TOMORROW.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.530
NOW, WHO'S IT GONNA BE?

11:04.530 --> 11:06.532
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.734
MY MAN HERE ISN'T
AFRAID OF BRAD.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.571
I'M TERRIFIED OF BRAD.
NO WAY I'M GOING.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.240
BUT YOU RAISED YOUR HAND.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.442
TO SUGGEST THAT YOU CREATE
ANOTHER DOPPELGANGER,

11:16.442 --> 11:19.378
ONE THAT'S DESIGNED
SPECIFICALLY
FOR THIS TASK.

11:19.378 --> 11:24.216
HMM. JAKE LONG,
I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.852
I KNOW IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.554
JAKE, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT BRAD.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.690
TRIX AND I TOTALLY
HAVE YOUR BACK.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.525
UH...

11:32.525 --> 11:33.926

11:34.527 --> 11:37.196
AAH!

11:37.196 --> 11:39.365
HEY, COOL ACORN PUPPET.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.634
JAKEY, WHAT IS
GOING ON IN HERE?

11:41.634 --> 11:43.769
MY SCHEDULE GOT
TOTALLY SWAMPED,

11:43.769 --> 11:46.605
SO I BROUGHT IN
A LITTLE HELP.

11:46.605 --> 11:52.211
THAT THIS ONE'S
THE REAL JAKE LONG
AND NOT THE OTHER ONE?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.212
SPUD, TRUST ME.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.480
I COULD TRUST YOU

11:54.480 --> 11:58.284
OR YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT MY FAVORITE POSSESSION IS.

11:58.284 --> 12:01.420
A BALL OF BELLY BUTTON
THAT YOU'VE BEEN COLLECTING
SINCE YOU WERE 3?

12:01.420 --> 12:05.357
ECCH! THAT'S DISGUSTING...
AND ALSO CORRECT.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.560
SO I'M CHOOSING
TO BELIEVE YOU FOR NOW.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.263
BUT I'LL BE KEEPING
MY EYE ON YOU.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.466
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND TAKE A WILD GUESS
ON THIS ONE.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.902
WE'VE BEEN DOUBLE-DUTCHING
WITH YOUR DOUBLE, RIGHT?

12:16.902 --> 12:21.373
YEP. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THIS GUY HAS SOME FLY MOVES.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.843
I JUMP ROPE,
THEREFORE I AM.

12:23.843 --> 12:27.613
THIS IS NOT ABOUT WINNING
THE DOUBLE-DUTCH TOURNAMENT.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.014
THIS IS ABOUT TRUST,
FRIENDSHIP.

12:29.014 --> 12:32.451
HEY, THAT BOY CAN PUT
A HURTIN' ON SOME JUMP ROPE.

12:32.451 --> 12:36.922
LOOK, GUYS, I JUST NEED
TO MAKE ONE MORE DOUBLE
OF MYSELF,

12:36.922 --> 12:39.725

THE BEATING FROM BRAD TOMORROW.

12:39.725 --> 12:42.461
LET'S SEE. HERE WE GO.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.467
I JUST WANNA SAY
FOR THE RECORD.

12:48.467 --> 12:52.037

JAKEY CLONES.

12:52.037 --> 12:55.708
OOH, EXCEPT THIS ONE.
OOH, HE IS ALL MINE, OK?

12:55.708 --> 12:58.544

12:58.544 --> 13:00.880
SO YOU DOWN WITH GETTING
BEATEN UP TOMORROW?

13:00.880 --> 13:03.983

IT HAD TO GO DOWN THIS WAY.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.490
JUST PROTECT YOUR FACE,

13:25.437 --> 13:26.639
YO, BRAD, WHAT UP?

13:26.639 --> 13:29.508
OH. I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD THE GUTS TO SHOW.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.811
SO WHERE DO YOU
WANT IT, HUH?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.013

13:52.832 --> 13:54.600
WHOA!

13:54.600 --> 13:55.968
IT'S DARK!

13:55.968 --> 13:58.003
I'M SCARED. WHOA!

13:58.003 --> 14:01.407
WHOA! WHOA!

14:01.807 --> 14:04.043
ALL RIGHT, JAKE!

14:08.881 --> 14:11.050
HUH. THAT WAS
SO NOT COOL.

14:11.050 --> 14:15.454
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
A BEATING FROM BRAD,
NOT DISH ONE OUT.

14:15.454 --> 14:19.358
MAYBE, BUT THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.
YOU'RE MY DOPPELGANGER.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.628
THAT MEANS YOU TAKE MY ORDERS
LIKE THE REST OF THE GANG.

14:22.628 --> 14:26.031
YEAH. THE THING IS,
I'M NOT LIKE THE OTHERS.

14:26.031 --> 14:29.635
HUH? YOU'RE RIGHT.
'CAUSE YOU'RE HISTORY.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.737
I'M REABSORBING YOU
RIGHT NOW.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.539
I DON'T THINK SO.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.908

14:38.811 --> 14:42.481
NOW, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.084
WHOA! AH!

14:45.918 --> 14:48.821
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE
TO KICK MY OWN BEHIND.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.589
BUT HERE GOES.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.524
DRAGON UP.

14:55.094 --> 14:58.497
WHOA. I'M FEELING
REALLY WEAK.

14:58.497 --> 15:01.734
HA. YOU FEEL WEAK
TO ME, TOO.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.035
AH!

15:03.035 --> 15:05.404
OH! OW! OW!

15:10.409 --> 15:12.778
KID, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE JOKING, HUH?

15:12.778 --> 15:15.547
DON'T YOU GET IT?
EVERY DOPPELGANGER YOU MAKE

15:15.547 --> 15:17.583
SUCKS AWAY PART
OF YOUR CHI ENERGY.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.618
THAT'S WHY YOUR
GAS TANK IS ON EMPTY.

15:19.618 --> 15:22.922
BUT IT WAS WORKING OUT FINE.
WHY DID THIS ONE GO BAD?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.957
I DID IT
JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

15:24.957 --> 15:28.661
I REACHED OVER HERE,
GRABBED THE VIAL.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.730
THIS IS A NEGATIVE
CHI AMPLIFIER.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.732
IF YOU MADE A DOPPELGANGER
WITH THIS STUFF,

15:33.732 --> 15:36.535
IT'S GUARANTEED TO BE
100% PURE EVIL.

15:36.535 --> 15:39.571

TO THIS PRETTY FACE?

15:39.571 --> 15:41.507

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
IN YOUR CONDITION.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.513
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REABSORB
ALL THE OTHER DOPPELGANGERS

15:47.513 --> 15:49.782
AND TAKE BACK THE STRENGTH
THEY'RE SUCKING FROM YOU.

15:49.782 --> 15:54.086
SO IF I REABSORB THEM,
I CAN TAKE THIS GUY OUT?

15:54.086 --> 15:55.621
UH, MAYBE.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.790
IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.925

REABSORB ME.

TO FINISH

16:01.126 --> 16:03.228

OH, RIGHT--NEVER.
