Hey! I got something!

00:18.176 --> 00:19.408
Reel it in.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.476
Man, feels like
a 200-pound marlin.

00:21.478 --> 00:22.844
What did we catch?

it's big.

Good morning,
fellow NCIS agents.

01:01.749 --> 01:03.549
Uh-huh.
- Good morning.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.598
Geez.

01:22.035 --> 01:23.501
What are you doing?

01:23.503 --> 01:25.904
Not my first rodeo.

01:25.906 --> 01:28.673
Day one on the job,
newbie always gets hazed.

01:28.675 --> 01:30.140
Broken chair,
rats in the desk

01:30.142 --> 01:32.943
Laxatives in the creamer.

01:32.945 --> 01:36.580
What kind of sociopaths
did you work with at FBI?

01:36.582 --> 01:39.549
Girl, after everything that
went down with the cartel,

01:39.551 --> 01:41.352
we got paperwork for days.

01:41.354 --> 01:43.120
Nobody got time for hazing.

01:43.122 --> 01:45.022
Congrats getting
through FLETC, though.

01:46.092 --> 01:47.957
Uh-huh.

01:54.966 --> 01:57.000
Gregorio!

01:58.669 --> 01:59.668
Yeah.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.537
You should have seen
your face.

02:01.539 --> 02:02.939
Yeah, we got you so good.

02:02.941 --> 02:05.540
NCIS Special Agent Gregorio,

02:05.542 --> 02:08.210
we'd like to officially
welcome you to our team,

02:08.211 --> 02:10.512
to the city, with
a special slice

02:10.514 --> 02:11.947
of New Orleans pecan pie.

02:11.949 --> 02:13.348
I appreciate it.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.317
And for future reference,
I hate surprises.

02:15.319 --> 02:16.618
So you hate fun.

02:16.620 --> 02:17.920
Surprises aren't fun.

02:17.922 --> 02:19.354
And I'm not much
of an agent

02:19.356 --> 02:20.889
if I can't sniff out
a surprise.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.358
Well, we got one
more for you.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.627
We know how badly you've
wanted to wear one of these,

02:26.629 --> 02:28.229
so we got you...
Please, don't say...

02:28.231 --> 02:29.663
...a hat.
...a hat.

02:29.665 --> 02:32.233
- Official NCIS team hat.
- Whoo-hoo.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.467
Do I have to?
Yes.

02:33.469 --> 02:35.403
Put it on right now.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.371
- Let me see. Yeah.
- Oh, that's nice.

02:37.373 --> 02:38.972
Oh, look at the happiness

02:38.974 --> 02:41.574
pouring out of the hat.

02:43.478 --> 02:44.911
I think I made a mistake.

02:44.913 --> 02:46.746
Time for work.

02:46.748 --> 02:48.415
The body of Lieutenant
Jay Nielsen was just

02:48.417 --> 02:49.882
fished out of the Gulf.

02:49.884 --> 02:52.618
Landing on Loretta's
table as we speak.

02:52.620 --> 02:55.988
Sonja, you're with me
at the morgue.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.823
Lasalle and Gregorio,

02:57.825 --> 03:00.725
dig into Lieutenant Nielsen's
recent whereabouts.

03:00.727 --> 03:04.029
Find out how he ended up
in the drink.

03:04.031 --> 03:05.931
Oh, you, a little agent.

03:06.934 --> 03:08.968
All right, so I'll contact

03:08.970 --> 03:10.569
his commanding officer,
next of kin.

03:10.571 --> 03:13.037
You take his financials
and phone records.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.873
What?

03:15.875 --> 03:17.141
Do I have something
in my teeth?

03:17.143 --> 03:18.977
What are you looking at?
No.

03:18.979 --> 03:21.479
I'm ranking agent
when Pride's not around,

03:21.481 --> 03:22.780
so I kind of call the shots.

03:22.782 --> 03:24.582
Oh, stop.
Are you for real?

03:24.584 --> 03:26.184
I know you were
a big deal in the FBI,

03:26.186 --> 03:29.286
but you're the newbie here,
so gotta follow team rules.

03:29.288 --> 03:33.290
Ah. So, uh, I jump
on the paper trail?

03:33.292 --> 03:34.627
Yeah, and I'll make
the phone calls.

03:34.651 --> 03:35.193
Okay.

03:35.194 --> 03:38.061
That hat looks good,
by the way.

03:48.339 --> 03:49.805
What have we got here, Loretta?

03:49.807 --> 03:51.840
Something out of
a Salvador Dali painting,

03:51.842 --> 03:53.142
it would seem.

03:53.144 --> 03:55.878
Wow! Shoot.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.714
Um, guessing a fish
didn't do that?

03:58.716 --> 04:00.616
Most definitely not.

04:00.618 --> 04:02.485
Lieutenant Nielsen died
of thermal shock.

04:02.487 --> 04:04.852
His heart, lungs, bones
literally melted

04:04.854 --> 04:07.389
by some intense,
concentrated heat.

04:07.391 --> 04:09.957
Ugh. Well, uh...

04:09.959 --> 04:11.626
Nielsen was stationed
in the Philippines

04:11.628 --> 04:14.162
for six months,
got back two days ago.

04:14.164 --> 04:15.830
This is a rough
homecoming.

04:15.832 --> 04:17.932
Mm, very rough,
and judging by

04:17.934 --> 04:19.600
the bruising on his face

04:19.601 --> 04:21.267
and defensive wounds
on his hands,

04:21.269 --> 04:23.370
our lieutenant was
in the fight of his life.

04:23.372 --> 04:26.340
Presumably with the person
who burned in his chest?

04:26.342 --> 04:27.474
Hey, uh,

04:27.476 --> 04:28.842
Tammy and Lasalle got

04:28.844 --> 04:30.511
Nielsen's last-known
whereabouts.

04:30.513 --> 04:32.612
Orleans Marina.
They're headed there now.

04:32.614 --> 04:34.248
Have 'em pick you up
on their way.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.083
Go. Learn things.

04:38.453 --> 04:40.238
Any idea what caused
the damage?

04:40.262 --> 04:41.788
No.

04:41.789 --> 04:44.323
And the chances of finding
out aren't favorable.

04:44.325 --> 04:48.027
With Sebastian getting
his NCIS shield,

04:48.029 --> 04:50.863
I get a revolving door
of temps.

04:50.865 --> 04:53.332
Ah.
Drop it like it's hot.

04:53.334 --> 04:56.268
I tested the flesh sample
you sent in, Doc Wade.

04:56.270 --> 04:58.370
Dude was <i>torched.</i>

04:58.372 --> 05:00.905
The dude has a name--
Lieutenant Nielsen.

05:00.907 --> 05:02.307
Right, Lieutenant Nielsen.

05:02.309 --> 05:04.443
Oh, man, that is gnarly.

05:04.445 --> 05:05.710
Agent Pride,

05:05.712 --> 05:08.913
meet our lab technician,
Claire Belcher.

05:08.915 --> 05:12.283
She's just graduated from
New Orleans Technical College.

05:12.285 --> 05:13.884
This is her first job.

05:13.886 --> 05:18.155
I have never seen
anything like that before.

05:18.157 --> 05:19.890
Glad to meet you,
Ms. Belcher.

05:19.892 --> 05:22.893
You were saying Lieutenant
Nielsen was torched.

05:22.895 --> 05:24.395
Any idea by what?

05:24.397 --> 05:26.897
I mean... wow.

05:26.899 --> 05:28.431
Like, he got melted.

05:28.433 --> 05:31.934
Yes. And we were
wondering what did it.

05:33.105 --> 05:35.171
I think, you know...

05:42.380 --> 05:43.846
I miss Sebastian.

05:43.848 --> 05:45.981
I see why.
Mm-hmm.

05:45.983 --> 05:48.250
Uh, I'll reach out
to FLETC,

05:48.252 --> 05:49.951
get Sebastian
the autopsy report.

05:49.953 --> 05:52.721
See if he can help us
narrow in on the murder weapon.

05:52.723 --> 05:55.324
When you talk to him,
have him call me.

05:55.326 --> 05:56.891
He's got me worried.

05:56.893 --> 05:59.928
Push-ups and obstacle courses
aren't really his forte.

05:59.930 --> 06:04.532
I will, but I'm sure he's
doing just fine, Loretta.

06:07.069 --> 06:08.769
Come on, Lund,
move, move, move!

06:08.771 --> 06:10.104
Let's go!

06:10.106 --> 06:12.373
I just... You know
“fight or flight”?

06:12.375 --> 06:14.575
Well, there's a third stress
response-- it's called “freeze”"

06:14.577 --> 06:18.513
And it's what I happen
to be experiencing right now.

06:18.515 --> 06:20.713
Shut up and ring the bell!

06:20.715 --> 06:22.449
I just... I don't see
the practical application

06:22.451 --> 06:24.284
of this exercise, sir.

06:24.286 --> 06:26.119
I mean, in what
real-world scenario

06:26.121 --> 06:28.188
would I ever have
to scale a rope, you know?

06:28.190 --> 06:29.922
Like, if I'm on a pirate ship?

06:29.924 --> 06:31.758
Wait, what-what are you doing?

06:31.760 --> 06:33.693
There's no room at the inn!

06:33.695 --> 06:35.728
Two's a crowd,
you know what I mean?

06:35.730 --> 06:38.130
Oh, God.

06:38.132 --> 06:40.832
What are you doing?
What... Uh.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.270
Wait...

06:44.272 --> 06:46.539
Wait, wait, wait.
Put that back.

06:46.541 --> 06:48.040
Ring the bell!

07:04.057 --> 07:06.757
Okay. Okay, I did it.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.427
I did it, now
put the pad back, please.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.506
I did it.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.541
You would have broken
your ankle if you hadn't.

07:24.543 --> 07:26.343
Fear only gets you
so far, Lund.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.277
You want to make agent,
you better find another way

07:28.279 --> 07:29.978
to motivate your butt
up that rope.

07:35.253 --> 07:38.120
Lieutenant Nielsen's wife said
he came home early from tour

07:38.122 --> 07:40.423
to take her on an anniversary
cruise on their boat.

07:40.425 --> 07:42.958
Lives in Shreveport,
drove down yesterday to prep.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.892
Next thing she knows,
CACO's at her door.

07:44.894 --> 07:46.394
She's left with
a broken heart

07:46.396 --> 07:48.597
while her husband
was literally melted away.

07:48.599 --> 07:49.931
Ladies first.
Oh, no.

07:49.933 --> 07:51.966
You're senior ranking agent.
By all means.

07:51.968 --> 07:53.801
Well, that's true.
But I'm also a gentleman,

07:53.803 --> 07:55.237
so after you.

07:55.239 --> 07:56.904
Oh, no, I...
Look, ladies,

07:56.906 --> 07:59.140
you're both pretty--
let's go.

08:01.111 --> 08:03.410
No bird poop, no salt deposits.

08:03.412 --> 08:05.279
No barnacle buildup.

08:05.281 --> 08:07.648
Considering this boat's been
sitting here for six months,

08:07.650 --> 08:09.450
it's in dang good shape.

08:09.452 --> 08:11.652
Too good. Check it.

08:11.654 --> 08:14.304
You see these black spots under
this fresh coat of paint?

08:14.328 --> 08:15.056
Mm-hmm.

08:15.057 --> 08:17.224
It's protein smoke damage.

08:17.226 --> 08:19.525
Used to see it in arson
cases with ATF.

08:19.527 --> 08:21.861
When the body catches fire,
the fats and oils

08:21.863 --> 08:23.763
turn into smoke
and coat everything.

08:23.765 --> 08:25.431
So this soot could be
leftover residue

08:25.433 --> 08:27.199
from our lieutenant's
burning chest?

08:27.201 --> 08:28.701
And it looks like
whoever torched him

08:28.703 --> 08:29.969
tried to paint over
the evidence

08:29.971 --> 08:31.404
and clean up the boat.

08:31.406 --> 08:34.039
Think we might have just
found our crime scene.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.640
I got something
y'all need to see.

08:37.844 --> 08:39.878
Mrs. Nielsen said the lieutenant
was the only one

08:39.880 --> 08:41.011
who had access to the boat,

08:41.014 --> 08:42.581
but I think she was wrong.

08:42.582 --> 08:44.082
Look at this.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.550
According to the hour meter,

08:45.552 --> 08:48.553
there's five trips,
12 hours each,

08:48.555 --> 08:49.988
over the last six months

08:49.990 --> 08:51.823
while the lieutenant
was stationed overseas.

08:51.825 --> 08:53.223
Someone else
was using the boat.

08:53.225 --> 08:54.492
The same someone
who killed him?

08:54.494 --> 08:56.360
The lieutenant stumbles
on the suspect,

08:56.362 --> 08:59.363
who proceeds to blowtorch him,
dump him in the Gulf.

08:59.365 --> 09:01.064
Now, that's cold-blooded.

09:01.066 --> 09:02.566
Well, whatever the perp was
using the boat for,

09:02.568 --> 09:04.067
he thought it was worth
killing over.

09:04.069 --> 09:06.337
I'm pulling up
the GPS trip history,

09:06.339 --> 09:07.805
replaying the last one.

09:16.881 --> 09:19.683
What was the boat doing
out at an oil rig?

09:19.685 --> 09:20.684
I don't know.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.051
But seeing as our boat thief

09:22.053 --> 09:24.421
was willing to murder
to cover his tracks,

09:24.423 --> 09:26.322
it can't be good.

09:37.929 --> 09:41.314
Apolis oil rig 5.
200 miles off the coast.

09:41.317 --> 09:44.450
Pumps 2,500 barrels
of crude a day.

09:44.452 --> 09:47.053
What has it got to do with the
murder of a Navy lieutenant?

09:47.055 --> 09:50.156
Well, no idea,
but Lieutenant Nielsen's killer

09:50.158 --> 09:52.691
took his stolen boat out
to that rig five times

09:52.693 --> 09:54.460
while he was stationed overseas.

09:54.462 --> 09:57.363
Long distance fuel bladders,
super charged engine.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.031
It's the perfect vessel
for the journey.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.532
Not so perfect once Nielsen
surprised the suspect,

10:01.534 --> 10:04.202
got lit up for his trouble
and dumped in the Gulf.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.171
A torch-wielding killer,

10:06.173 --> 10:07.872
a stolen boat
and an offshore oil rig.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.474
What's the connection?

10:09.476 --> 10:11.542
Hey. Uh, sorry it took me
a little bit to call you back.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.845
I've been... otherwise engaged.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.947
I bet. Training going okay?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.449
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Couldn't be better.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.916
Uh, you know.
Making life-long friends.

10:19.918 --> 10:22.286
Achieving personal bests.
The usual.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.255
You find time to look at
the autopsy report we sent?

10:25.257 --> 10:27.424
Yeah, yeah. I did,
and I-I think I know

10:27.426 --> 10:29.893
what killed Lieutenant Nielsen.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.962
Everything okay, Sebastian?

10:31.964 --> 10:34.031
Oh, sure. Yeah. All good.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.564
So why are you so whispery?

10:35.566 --> 10:37.166
I just... I'm not
technically allowed

10:37.168 --> 10:39.702
to be on my phone right now,
but, um... it's...

10:39.704 --> 10:41.170
it's totally cool. So listen.

10:41.172 --> 10:42.805
I, uh, based
on the chemical residue

10:42.807 --> 10:44.374
on the victim's body, I think

10:44.376 --> 10:46.075
that your murder weapon
was a deep-sea,

10:46.077 --> 10:47.810
oxy-fueled welding torch.

10:47.812 --> 10:50.046
Now, you need certification
from the American Welders Union

10:50.048 --> 10:51.881
to own and... and operate one.

10:51.883 --> 10:53.281
We check their database,

10:53.283 --> 10:54.416
might be able to compile a list

10:54.418 --> 10:56.251
of suspects.
Good work, Sebastian.

10:56.253 --> 10:57.519
Okay. Thanks. I got to go.

10:57.521 --> 10:59.054
Sure it's
going okay, Sebastian?

10:59.056 --> 11:00.555
No. What? Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:00.557 --> 11:02.457
No. It's great.
Uh, everything's awesome.

11:02.459 --> 11:03.625
To be honest,
I'm having a great time,

11:03.627 --> 11:05.093
and it couldn't be better, so...

11:05.095 --> 11:06.861
Damn it, Lund!
I said no cell phones!

11:06.863 --> 11:08.296
Oh. Okay, all right.

11:08.298 --> 11:10.164
He seems friendly.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.999
No. That's Special
Agent Perkins.

11:12.001 --> 11:15.102
I saw him make a former Marine
cry on my first day at FLETC.

11:15.104 --> 11:16.870
Luckily, I only had to
do the weekend course,

11:16.872 --> 11:18.772
and I barely made it
through that one.

11:18.774 --> 11:20.707
So, Sebastian's toast.

11:20.709 --> 11:23.744
Well, what he lacks in strength,
he makes up for in spirit.

11:23.746 --> 11:25.712
I'll bet you anything
he makes it through.

11:25.714 --> 11:27.047
Save the bets for later.

11:27.049 --> 11:30.016
Chris, Gregorio, get
to Apolis HQ. See if they got

11:30.018 --> 11:32.152
any idea what that boat
was doing out by their rig.

11:32.154 --> 11:33.920
I got an old friend
at the Welders Union,

11:33.922 --> 11:37.290
should be able to get us access
to their database.

11:41.363 --> 11:43.462
Can't help you.
Haven't heard one word

11:43.464 --> 11:45.230
about a boat near rig 5.

11:45.232 --> 11:48.133
It crossed your safety
perimeter multiple times.

11:48.135 --> 11:49.401
Don't you have security in place

11:49.403 --> 11:50.702
to monitor vessels
from doing that?

11:50.704 --> 11:52.438
You interested
in how I run my company

11:52.440 --> 11:53.905
or whether I saw this boat?

11:53.907 --> 11:56.542
It's all right, Mom.
I'll explain.

11:56.544 --> 11:59.010
When the indexes fell
and the oil market bottomed out,

11:59.012 --> 12:01.712
we were forced to make
some hard fiscal decisions.

12:01.714 --> 12:03.548
We had to cut security,
plain and simple.

12:03.550 --> 12:06.517
$100,000 for an MBA
and he's speaking gibberish.

12:06.519 --> 12:08.519
You got 24 men out there
in international waters

12:08.521 --> 12:10.555
and no one looking
out for them?

12:10.557 --> 12:13.757
We're not BP.
we're a family business.

12:13.759 --> 12:15.893
And with prices falling at the
pumps, we either had to start

12:15.895 --> 12:17.961
cutting shifts
or cut security personnel.

12:17.963 --> 12:18.995
Damn it.

12:18.997 --> 12:20.263
These perimeter breaches,

12:20.265 --> 12:22.132
they correspond with
leaks to our pipeline.

12:22.134 --> 12:24.267
Leaks?
Six months back,

12:24.269 --> 12:26.436
puncture-leaks start
popping up around rig 5.

12:26.438 --> 12:28.905
Had to shut down oil production
till we welded them up.

12:28.907 --> 12:31.841
Lieutenant Nielsen was killed
by a deep-sea welding torch.

12:31.843 --> 12:33.610
Maybe it was intended
for something else.

12:33.612 --> 12:35.544
Like making holes
in the pipeline.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.580
Any idea who would want
to do something like this?

12:37.582 --> 12:39.081
Just about every one
of our competitors.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.749
Yes, except our engineers
determined those leaks

12:40.751 --> 12:42.684
to be normal wear
and tear to our pipeline.

12:42.686 --> 12:44.786
Don't be so naive, Elliot.
We're all hurting here.

12:44.788 --> 12:46.355
Every time
we shut down a rig,

12:46.357 --> 12:48.357
oil prices spike
across the seaboard.

12:48.359 --> 12:50.926
Corporate sabotage.
I feel like I'm back in D.C.

12:50.928 --> 12:53.294
This may not be Washington,
but oil's a cutthroat business.

12:53.296 --> 12:55.763
What do you need
to get to the bottom of this?

12:55.765 --> 12:57.832
Help us I.D. the killer
on that boat.

12:57.834 --> 12:58.933
Anybody saw something, it'd be

12:58.935 --> 13:00.101
one of those men
out on that rig.

13:00.103 --> 13:01.569
Then we'll need
to get on that rig.

13:01.571 --> 13:03.471
Well, I got a helo

13:03.473 --> 13:06.141
taking a shift out in an hour.

13:06.143 --> 13:07.675
One seat left if you want it.

13:07.677 --> 13:09.343
I'll take it.
I'll take it.

13:09.345 --> 13:10.910
Rock-paper-scissors?

13:10.912 --> 13:13.247
All right.
Ah, it's a waste of time.

13:13.249 --> 13:15.382
We're not getting
on that seat anyway.

13:15.384 --> 13:16.983
Well, who is?

14:03.229 --> 14:05.629
First time out, huh?

14:05.631 --> 14:07.731
You know where I can
find the rig manager?

14:07.733 --> 14:10.334
Keep up. I'll show you.

14:10.336 --> 14:13.837
Oh, yeah. Smell that?

14:13.839 --> 14:15.939
Petrol, B.O.

14:15.941 --> 14:17.574
and the sweet ocean breeze.

14:17.576 --> 14:20.276
Embrace it.
No place like it on Earth.

14:20.278 --> 14:21.777
How long you
been roughnecking?

14:21.779 --> 14:22.845
Two years.

14:22.847 --> 14:24.814
This is my last hitch, though.

14:24.816 --> 14:28.451
Time for the next part
of my journey, a new frontier.

14:28.453 --> 14:30.920
Here. Check this out.

14:31.823 --> 14:34.089
“Your Heart's Desire Charters”.

14:34.091 --> 14:35.624
I've trekked the Andes,

14:35.626 --> 14:37.992
navigated transatlantic
cargo ships,

14:37.994 --> 14:41.663
got my degree, and now...
my pilot's license.

14:41.665 --> 14:43.932
Plus the sweetest little
twin engine Cessna

14:43.934 --> 14:45.467
you've ever laid eyes on.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.935
Very impressive.
Mm.

14:46.937 --> 14:50.504
Can I give you a piece
of unsolicited advice?

14:50.506 --> 14:52.673
While you're here,
set your eyes on the work,

14:52.675 --> 14:54.842
not the view. Rig's
a dangerous place.

14:54.844 --> 14:57.144
And it's remote. By the time
the medevac gets here,

14:57.146 --> 14:58.613
it's always too late.

14:58.615 --> 15:00.348
I'll keep that in mind.

15:00.350 --> 15:02.250
There's your man.

15:02.252 --> 15:03.718
And remember,

15:03.720 --> 15:05.886
eyes on the rig.

15:16.064 --> 15:17.930
You must be Agent Pride.

15:17.932 --> 15:20.199
I'm Hauser.
Glad to have you aboard.

15:20.201 --> 15:21.301
Thank you.

15:21.303 --> 15:22.369
Corporate told me to give you

15:22.371 --> 15:23.770
access to whatever you need,

15:23.772 --> 15:26.171
so, you say jump,
I'll say how high.

15:26.173 --> 15:27.640
I appreciate it.

15:27.642 --> 15:29.475
I need to speak to your crew.

15:29.477 --> 15:31.843
See if any of them remember
a boat that's been out here.

15:31.845 --> 15:34.480
Most recently, a
couple nights back?

15:34.482 --> 15:36.382
Oh, we get a lot
of boats out here.

15:36.384 --> 15:39.050
You... You want to
be more specific?

15:39.052 --> 15:41.519
The 45 foot Super Sport.

15:41.521 --> 15:43.388
Someone was using it illegally.

15:43.390 --> 15:45.122
Oh. She's a beauty.
I'm guessin' there's more

15:45.124 --> 15:46.891
to the story
than just some joyridin'

15:46.893 --> 15:48.259
to bring NCIS out here.

15:48.261 --> 15:50.662
Navy lieutenant
was murdered on it.

15:50.664 --> 15:54.231
Okay. Well, let's, uh... let's
talk to the floor hands first.

16:02.341 --> 16:04.874
Of course Pride spent summers
working on his uncle's oil rig.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.643
What hasn't the guy done?

16:06.645 --> 16:09.613
Certifiable Renaissance man.
That's why he's the boss.

16:09.615 --> 16:11.581
But this is why I'm the man.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.684
Found you a suspect
in the lieutenant's murder.

16:13.686 --> 16:15.118
Pride's connection paid off.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.186
We got us access
to the Welders Union database.

16:17.188 --> 16:18.654
We've been combing through it,
cross-referencing

16:18.656 --> 16:20.690
with Lieutenant Nielsen's
personal life.

16:20.692 --> 16:23.492
Darren Meade. Card-carrying
member of the union,

16:23.494 --> 16:24.993
Lieutenant Nielsen's
brother-in-law.

16:24.995 --> 16:27.029
Would have known
Nielsen was on tour,

16:27.031 --> 16:28.764
and known his boat
was available.

16:28.766 --> 16:30.098
And according to union records,

16:30.100 --> 16:32.367
he refilled
an oxygenized torch-tank

16:32.369 --> 16:34.035
the morning of Nielsen's murder.

16:34.037 --> 16:35.236
Where's Darren Meade now?

16:35.238 --> 16:36.604
Well, that's the kicker.

16:36.606 --> 16:37.939
Darren works the rigs
for a living.

16:37.941 --> 16:40.041
He just cycled
into a ten-day shift.

16:40.043 --> 16:43.010
- Guess where.
- Apolis oil rig 5.

16:43.012 --> 16:45.513
Pride's on the rig with
the killer, and doesn't know it?

16:45.515 --> 16:47.615
200 miles off the coast. He
ain't got cell reception either.

16:47.617 --> 16:50.718
I'll call the rig's sat line.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.220
We got to warn him.

16:54.923 --> 16:57.157
You sure you didn't
see a Super Sport?

16:57.159 --> 16:58.726
No, sir.

16:58.728 --> 17:00.361
Can't say I seen it.

17:00.363 --> 17:01.862
When did you say
it was here?

17:01.864 --> 17:03.997
Around 11:00 p.m.
Couple nights back.

17:03.999 --> 17:06.566
Manager said you
were working the swing shift.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.800
From this vantage point,
you would've had a clear view.

17:08.803 --> 17:09.902
Yeah.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.604
I would've.

17:11.606 --> 17:13.506
But I didn't see nothing.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.678
Nasty bruise you got
on your neck. What happened?

17:18.680 --> 17:22.080
Ran into a water pipe
below deck.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.582
Pipe happened to be hand shaped?

17:23.584 --> 17:27.085
Got all kinds of pipes
on Apolis.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.788
According to personnel records,

17:29.790 --> 17:31.289
you're the only welder
on this rig

17:31.291 --> 17:33.258
authorized to use that torch.

17:34.294 --> 17:36.728
I guess that's true.

17:36.730 --> 17:39.063
What's it to you?

17:39.065 --> 17:40.831
Well, your boss says you've been
working repairs

17:40.833 --> 17:42.232
the last two weeks.

17:42.234 --> 17:44.435
Assuming that if I check
the shift logs

17:44.437 --> 17:46.771
two nights back, I'd find you.

17:47.807 --> 17:49.172
Why would you do that?

17:49.174 --> 17:51.008
'Cause you've been lying to me.

18:20.514 --> 18:22.447
<i>This is just a drill.</i>

18:22.449 --> 18:25.650
All crew members report
to the mess hall.

18:25.652 --> 18:29.453
I repeat, all crew to the mess
hall for a safety check.

18:29.455 --> 18:30.754
You stashing away the crew

18:30.756 --> 18:32.122
till we figure out
how to play this?

18:32.124 --> 18:33.990
There's only one
way to play this.

18:33.992 --> 18:35.459
Take care of this guy
before he gets

18:35.461 --> 18:37.661
to one of those lifeboats,
or gets word off this rig.

18:37.663 --> 18:39.996
It should be easier
now that I got his gun.

18:39.998 --> 18:42.132
Yeah. It'd be easier
if you'd played it cool

18:42.134 --> 18:43.400
instead of going all pyro.

18:43.402 --> 18:44.735
We can't even find him.

18:44.737 --> 18:46.269
No choice. He was onto us.

18:46.271 --> 18:49.205
So what?
We're killin' a cop now?

18:53.511 --> 18:55.478
<i>I get no pleasure from it,</i>

18:55.480 --> 18:59.749
but we do what we have to
to take care of our own. Right?

18:59.751 --> 19:02.051
Bodies are starting to stack up.
Hey, we got into this

19:02.053 --> 19:03.184
to make some money,

19:03.186 --> 19:04.720
provide for our families.

19:04.722 --> 19:07.055
I'm not about to go to prison
for it. Are you?

19:09.560 --> 19:11.926
Put a bullet in him,
toss him over.

19:17.735 --> 19:20.033
The downwellings out here
will take his body

19:20.035 --> 19:21.702
right to the ocean floor.

19:21.704 --> 19:23.103
Nobody will ever see it again.

19:23.105 --> 19:24.838
Just be another rig accident.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.941
Guy panicked during
a safety drill, fell overboard.

19:36.185 --> 19:38.351
What makes you think
they'll buy that?

19:38.353 --> 19:40.587
'Cause I got
two witnesses

19:40.589 --> 19:42.322
to back up my story.

19:59.707 --> 20:01.206
I take it no luck?

20:01.208 --> 20:03.575
Apolis HQ lost all
communications to the rig.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.577
They're scrambling to figure out
what's going on.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.546
You do any better
with the Coast Guard?

20:07.548 --> 20:09.014
Redirecting their nearest
cutter-- it'll be three,

20:09.016 --> 20:11.482
four hours before the boat
reaches that rig.

20:11.484 --> 20:13.451
So we got no way
of warning Pride

20:13.453 --> 20:15.753
he's out there
with a killer.

20:15.755 --> 20:18.389
Killers, plural.
Dumped Darren's phone records

20:18.391 --> 20:20.257
from the night of the murder.

20:20.259 --> 20:22.393
He was in touch with
two Apolis employees--

20:22.395 --> 20:24.462
Jackson Hauser
and Lyle Peterson.

20:24.464 --> 20:26.964
Yeah, I checked their texts--
it appears that two of them

20:26.966 --> 20:29.299
was on the lieutenant's boat
the night he got torched.

20:29.301 --> 20:31.835
So Pride's not with one
killer, he's with three?

20:31.837 --> 20:33.337
And a trained one at that.

20:33.339 --> 20:35.905
Hauser's ex-infantry,
fought in Afghanistan.

20:35.907 --> 20:37.674
These guys put holes
in that pipeline.

20:37.676 --> 20:39.543
There's a good chance
they'll want to take Pride out

20:39.545 --> 20:41.712
before he blows the whistle.
And we don't have time to wait

20:41.714 --> 20:43.279
for the Coast Guard cutter
to get there.

20:43.281 --> 20:44.447
Let's call them back,

20:44.449 --> 20:45.948
see if they'll chopper us out.
All right.

20:45.950 --> 20:47.650
Patton, Sonja, keep trying

20:47.652 --> 20:49.652
to reestablish connection
with the rig.

20:49.654 --> 20:51.420
Call Sebastian if you have to.

20:51.422 --> 20:53.288
Do whatever it takes.
On it.

20:53.290 --> 20:54.990
Gregorio, you're with me.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.859
Not a bad Pride
impression, Lasalle.

20:56.861 --> 20:58.728
I still prefer
the real thing, though.

20:58.730 --> 21:01.163
Trust me, so do I.
Let's go get him.

21:02.265 --> 21:04.332
Oh, just another day
in paradise.

21:04.334 --> 21:07.301
Hey, if you're looking
for the mess hall, my man,

21:07.303 --> 21:09.070
this ain't it.
I'm a federal agent.

21:09.072 --> 21:11.038
There are men on this rig
who are trying to kill me.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.841
I need to get a line out.

21:12.843 --> 21:14.642
The whole system's offline.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.778
Sensors, radio, satcom,
all of it.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.812
Is there any other way
to get a message off this thing?

21:18.814 --> 21:20.447
There's a distress beacon
in the rig cellar--

21:20.449 --> 21:22.716
you can send an SOS
using Morse code.

21:28.190 --> 21:30.457
That dude did not
just shoot at us!

21:31.494 --> 21:32.593
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

21:34.062 --> 21:36.095
All right, we got to get
out of here. Come on.

21:36.097 --> 21:38.197
Before they bust in...
This is not what I meant

21:38.199 --> 21:40.299
when I said I wanted
to go out with a bang

21:40.301 --> 21:41.601
on my last tour.

21:49.377 --> 21:50.576
Hey.

21:50.578 --> 21:52.211
Here you go, drink that.

21:52.213 --> 21:54.178
Slow.

21:58.452 --> 22:01.497
You want to tell me why those
grease monkeys want you dead?

22:01.498 --> 22:04.423
They killed a Navy sailor, and I'm not
gonna let them get away with it.

22:04.425 --> 22:08.593
If you're gonna take out
those fools, I'm with you.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.462
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.433
What are you gonna
do with that?

22:12.457 --> 22:13.665
Where I grew up,

22:13.666 --> 22:15.666
if someone takes a swing at you,
you swing back.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.702
Okay, all right, that's
an honorable code, but...

22:18.704 --> 22:21.705
a wrench won't do any
good against a SIG Sauer

22:21.707 --> 22:23.874
with 11 rounds left
in the magazine.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.309
Well, what do you propose, then?

22:25.311 --> 22:27.076
You take me
to those signal beacons.

22:27.078 --> 22:29.479
I'll get word to my team,
get backup.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.247
We'll take these guys down.

22:31.249 --> 22:33.049
Hey, I'm not looking
to get deputized here.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.484
And I'm not much for “we,” okay?

22:34.486 --> 22:36.085
So you do you and I'll do me.

22:36.087 --> 22:38.287
Maybe find another one
of those flare guns.

22:38.289 --> 22:39.856
Bonnie. Bonnie, right?

22:39.858 --> 22:41.691
Yeah.
Okay, listen, I need you

22:41.693 --> 22:43.525
to do what
I tell you to do.

22:43.527 --> 22:45.794
There are 20 innocent people
up in that commissary.

22:45.796 --> 22:48.530
We get into a shoot out,
someone hits a fuel tank,

22:48.532 --> 22:50.566
their deaths are gonna be on us.

22:50.568 --> 22:52.801
We got to do our part,

22:52.803 --> 22:55.203
and running
into a hail of bullets isn't it.

22:55.205 --> 22:58.306
So are you gonna show me
where those beacons are,

22:58.308 --> 23:00.075
or do I have
to find them myself?

23:01.243 --> 23:03.778
You better have
one hell of a cavalry.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.746
Three of the best agents
in the country.

23:06.616 --> 23:07.949
Three?

23:07.951 --> 23:09.951
As in three people?

23:09.953 --> 23:11.819
For now. Couple weeks
I'll have a fourth--

23:11.821 --> 23:13.454
he's got to get
through training.

23:13.456 --> 23:14.822
Oh, God.
Come on, let's go.

23:14.824 --> 23:16.090
All right.

23:26.234 --> 23:28.201
Sebastian!

23:28.203 --> 23:30.003
Oh. Sorry, guys.

23:38.946 --> 23:43.081
Ow, ow, cut it out,
cut it out, ow, ow.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.484
I said no more
cell phones, Lund.

23:45.486 --> 23:48.053
You got yourself killed,
and your team, too!

23:48.055 --> 23:50.956
I can explain.
No, you can't, because you are dead.

23:50.958 --> 23:52.991
Dead men do not talk.
Yeah, but the point is

23:52.993 --> 23:54.959
my team keeps calling me,
and I-I can't...

23:54.961 --> 23:57.695
I don't care if the president
of the United States is calling you.

23:57.697 --> 24:00.031
I catch you on that
phone again, you're done.

24:00.033 --> 24:01.265
Got it?!

24:01.267 --> 24:03.434
Put it away!

24:04.504 --> 24:06.037
Get in there and start over.

24:06.039 --> 24:07.705
Go!

24:15.280 --> 24:17.848
Which way?

24:17.850 --> 24:19.550
Aw, man.
What?

24:19.552 --> 24:21.317
The hits keep comin'.

24:21.319 --> 24:23.420
Too much drill fluid's
being pumped in.

24:23.422 --> 24:25.621
It's overstressing the well.
How bad are we talking?

24:25.623 --> 24:27.745
Like “Four Horsemen of
the Apocalypse” bad.

24:27.746 --> 24:28.876
We got to get out
of here right now.

24:28.877 --> 24:30.619
Whoa, whoa, Bonnie, no, no, we...

24:30.643 --> 24:31.962
we still have to get
to the signal beacons,

24:31.963 --> 24:34.396
warn my team, warn everybody.
Okay, fine,

24:34.398 --> 24:35.631
but we got to hurry up.

24:35.633 --> 24:36.799
These gauges are telling me

24:36.801 --> 24:37.767
this rig's gonna blow.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.401
This way.

24:44.007 --> 24:46.575
This rig is basically
one giant Wi-Fi receiver.

24:46.577 --> 24:49.077
There's no good reason
why I can't connect.

24:49.079 --> 24:50.411
Hate to admit it,

24:50.413 --> 24:52.113
but I can use an
assist from Sebastian.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.615
Well, I've called him,
like, ten times.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.684
I even left word
with the training officer.

24:55.686 --> 24:57.085
Still nothing.

24:58.822 --> 25:00.788
What the...
what is that?

25:01.791 --> 25:03.156
It's coming from the rig.

25:03.158 --> 25:06.894
Someone's broadcasting
Morse code off that rig.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.129
I think we know who.

25:09.131 --> 25:11.932
Pride for the win.
Hand me a pen.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.302
Where'd you learn that, ATF?

25:15.304 --> 25:17.503
No. Girl Scouts.
Really?

25:17.505 --> 25:18.771
Senior level.

25:18.773 --> 25:20.539
Well, let's hear it,
troop leader.

25:23.712 --> 25:26.445
Rig is going to... blow.

25:26.447 --> 25:28.414
Stay...

25:28.416 --> 25:30.116
away.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.586
God, I hope
my Morse code is rusty.

25:33.588 --> 25:35.687
One way to check.
NASA open source,

25:35.689 --> 25:37.990
EO-1 thermal satellite.

25:37.992 --> 25:40.626
Okay, I just aimed it
at the rig.

25:41.662 --> 25:43.561
Oh, no, your Morse code
ain't rusty.

25:43.563 --> 25:46.164
That red storm cloud
is all hydrocarbon gas.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.465
Meaning...?

25:47.467 --> 25:48.867
Meaning if we don't act fast,

25:48.869 --> 25:51.435
we're looking <i>Deepwater Horizon</i>
all over again.

25:51.437 --> 25:53.738
How long do we have?

25:55.407 --> 25:57.341
Not long.

26:10.197 --> 26:12.444
Pride's out there on that
ticking time bomb of a rig

26:12.445 --> 26:14.364
with three killers, and
you turn the car around?

26:14.365 --> 26:16.347
Give me the keys-- I'm
getting on that chopper.

26:16.348 --> 26:17.244
You're not going anywhere.

26:17.268 --> 26:18.781
Fine, I'll take
my own damn car.

26:18.782 --> 26:19.986
You're not the boss, Lasalle.

26:20.010 --> 26:21.625
No, I'm not. Pride is.

26:21.626 --> 26:23.591
And whether he's right here
or 200 miles off the coast,

26:23.615 --> 26:24.325
we do what he says.

26:24.326 --> 26:25.825
I don't...

26:28.694 --> 26:29.827
Now, we all

26:29.829 --> 26:32.230
want Pride back at his desk...

26:32.232 --> 26:34.098
but we cannot do that
by arguing.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.399
Gregorio,

26:35.401 --> 26:37.068
Lasalle is right.
With the amount

26:37.070 --> 26:39.436
of HC gas around this rig,
by the time you get there,

26:39.438 --> 26:40.322
it'll be too late.

26:40.346 --> 26:41.473
Well, I'm not
just gonna

26:41.474 --> 26:42.907
sit around and watch it blow.

26:42.909 --> 26:44.640
Pride is
counting on us

26:44.642 --> 26:46.442
to find a way to save him

26:46.444 --> 26:49.079
<i>and</i> the people on that rig.

26:49.081 --> 26:51.014
So let's get to work.

26:51.016 --> 26:53.416
All right.
Where do we start?

26:53.418 --> 26:55.418
I got it.

26:55.420 --> 26:58.121
Follow me. I'll show you.

27:00.359 --> 27:02.258
Kept my system scanning

27:02.260 --> 27:04.927
for radio signals
to and from the rig.

27:04.929 --> 27:08.130
Someone is remotely signaling
the rig's fluid pumps,

27:08.132 --> 27:10.632
filling the well with mud,
messing up the hole pressure.

27:10.634 --> 27:12.434
Explains why it's
about to blow.

27:12.436 --> 27:13.523
Well, our three killers
are on the rig--

27:13.547 --> 27:15.038
you saying they have an accomplice?

27:15.039 --> 27:17.839
Someone willing to sacrifice their lives
to cover their tracks.

27:17.841 --> 27:18.873
Can we kill the signal?

27:18.875 --> 27:20.608
Got to find out
where it's coming from.

27:20.610 --> 27:21.725
Any idea on the accomplice?

27:21.749 --> 27:22.912
Well, it could be
ecoterrorists.

27:22.913 --> 27:24.979
They've targeted
the Gulf rigs before.

27:24.981 --> 27:26.981
No, the three suspects
are lifelong roughnecks--

27:26.983 --> 27:28.783
not exactly tree huggers.

27:28.785 --> 27:30.651
Hey, maybe one
of Apolis's competitors.

27:30.653 --> 27:33.554
Maybe, but I got a feeling
this hits closer to home.

27:33.556 --> 27:36.256
There's only two ways
that rig's remotely operated--

27:36.258 --> 27:38.525
either by a hacker,
or someone who has access

27:38.527 --> 27:40.209
to the control center
at Apolis.

27:40.233 --> 27:40.828
Wait.

27:40.829 --> 27:43.330
Why would Apolis want
to blow up their own rig?

27:43.332 --> 27:45.432
Same reason
their competitors would.

27:45.434 --> 27:47.467
Patton, can you pull
Apolis's revenue streams

27:47.469 --> 27:49.836
over the last six months
on the go?

27:49.838 --> 27:52.038
We're going to Apolis HQ.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.672
Do you even have to ask?

27:55.143 --> 27:56.675
Your move, Gregorio.

27:56.677 --> 27:58.177
All right.

28:02.016 --> 28:04.050
Close down 15.

28:04.052 --> 28:06.018
And the mud-gas
separator.

28:07.488 --> 28:09.020
No, it's not working.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.588
Someone must be
remotely overriding the pumps.

28:10.590 --> 28:11.856
We can't stop them.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.858
Got to keep trying.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.294
If we stick around here,
we're dead. Come on!

28:16.296 --> 28:18.029
We got to get everyone
off this rig.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.965
Right behind you.

28:19.967 --> 28:22.167
Okay. Lifeboats
are through here.

28:22.169 --> 28:23.736
You prep the boats--
I'll bring the crew to you.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.303
Okay.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.311
Come on.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.349
Johnny, you got to
move this crane.

28:38.351 --> 28:39.883
Benny's got a
tug coming in.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.852
Hey, you can't just
come onto my property

28:41.854 --> 28:44.153
anytime you want.
Got a warrant that says we can.

28:44.155 --> 28:46.022
Your whole facility
is under our control.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.690
We checked your revenue streams.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.193
When you shut down rig 5,
your competitors benefited,

28:50.195 --> 28:52.428
but guess whose earnings
went up the most?

28:52.430 --> 28:55.131
You paid your own men to put
holes in your own pipeline,

28:55.133 --> 28:57.433
choke out the oil,
raise the prices of gas.

28:57.435 --> 28:59.547
And got an innocent sailor
killed in the process.

28:59.548 --> 29:01.171
I don't have to listen
to a word of this.

29:01.195 --> 29:02.205
I'm calling my lawyers.

29:02.206 --> 29:04.806
Oh, no, you're not. Someone
in your office is controlling

29:04.808 --> 29:06.808
the pressure
systems of the rig.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.443
And we're
finding out who.

29:08.445 --> 29:10.278
You don't have
a shred of evidence.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.215
We got three roughnecks on that
rig that are ready to bury you.

29:13.217 --> 29:15.083
Which is why you're
trying to blow it up.

29:15.085 --> 29:16.385
If you want to
avoid a lifetime in prison,

29:16.387 --> 29:18.952
you need to tell us
how to stop this from happening.

29:18.954 --> 29:21.288
All I've ever done
is try to grow my business,

29:21.290 --> 29:22.589
look out for my people.

29:22.591 --> 29:24.691
I'd give up everything
to save those men out there.

29:24.693 --> 29:27.261
I'm not responsible
for this catastrophe.

29:27.263 --> 29:29.863
Okay. If not you,
then who, a technician?

29:29.865 --> 29:31.365
They'd have to know
the passcodes

29:31.367 --> 29:32.333
to override the system.

29:32.335 --> 29:34.634
Only one person...

29:36.538 --> 29:39.406
God help me.

29:40.475 --> 29:42.642
My son.

29:43.811 --> 29:45.811
He's our CTO,
designed the system himself.

29:45.813 --> 29:47.047
He's the only one.

29:47.049 --> 29:48.648
Where is he now?

29:48.650 --> 29:51.250
Didn't feel well.
Said he had the flu, went home.

29:51.252 --> 29:53.718
More like the airport.
I'll put a BOLO out.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.987
I gave him
everything.

29:56.857 --> 29:59.324
You have to help me stop this.

29:59.326 --> 30:01.726
Good news and bad-- Patton
reestablished comms with the rig

30:01.728 --> 30:03.828
and shut off the mud
being pumped into the well.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.230
And the bad?

30:05.232 --> 30:07.332
This thing is past the point
of no return,

30:07.334 --> 30:08.766
and whoever was messing with it

30:08.768 --> 30:10.468
disabled
the blowout preventer, too.

30:10.470 --> 30:12.303
Evacuation countdown's
already begun.

30:12.305 --> 30:14.038
We got 15 minutes
before it goes up.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.073
Any way to save it?

30:15.075 --> 30:16.240
Yeah. A miracle.

30:16.242 --> 30:19.544
Or a mechanical genius
with an IQ of 160.

30:22.315 --> 30:25.015
Have Patton send me the rig blueprints
and get me patched in out there.

30:25.017 --> 30:26.386
I'm gonna be on a computer
in two shakes.

30:26.410 --> 30:27.017
Damn it, Lund!

30:27.018 --> 30:28.485
You just can't
help yourself, can you?

30:28.487 --> 30:29.752
It's an emergency!
I don't care!

30:29.754 --> 30:31.421
You want a badge,
you belong to me.

30:31.423 --> 30:33.090
No emergencies,
no exceptions.

30:33.092 --> 30:35.625
And no way you're going
to those computers. You got it?

30:35.627 --> 30:38.261
No, I don't get it. Because
if it's a choice between my team

30:38.263 --> 30:40.497
or my badge, then I'm gonna
choose my team every time.

30:40.499 --> 30:42.498
And right now, they need me.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.101
<i>You got no more moves,</i>

30:45.103 --> 30:46.535
Agent Pride!

30:46.537 --> 30:48.036
Come on out!

30:48.038 --> 30:49.371
We'll conversate.

30:49.373 --> 30:51.407
It's a deal. Soon as you drop

30:51.409 --> 30:53.275
your weapons
and surrender.

30:53.277 --> 30:55.144
I'm not the one
who has to surrender.

30:55.146 --> 30:57.413
And I've got
you cornered.

30:57.415 --> 31:00.047
No way out.

31:01.784 --> 31:04.051
He's right. We're screwed.

31:08.291 --> 31:10.057
Why are you looking at me
like that?

31:10.059 --> 31:12.193
You're not claustrophobic,
are you?

31:12.195 --> 31:14.962
What?

31:17.533 --> 31:19.966
This is a
really bad idea.

31:19.968 --> 31:22.402
I don't even know where
the ventilation system leads to.

31:22.404 --> 31:24.070
Out of here. That's for sure.

31:24.072 --> 31:28.375
Listen, you follow this vent
until you find another one.

31:28.377 --> 31:31.077
Get to the mess hall and get
the crew to the lifeboats.

31:36.217 --> 31:37.816
We're back online.

31:37.818 --> 31:40.419
Hello?

31:40.421 --> 31:43.122
It's for you.

31:44.459 --> 31:45.958
Pride.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.127
Pride, it's Sebastian.
No time for small talk,

31:48.129 --> 31:50.828
but I think I got a way to stop
the blowout on the rig.

31:50.830 --> 31:52.997
Sebastian, you're a lifesaver.
Now, you're gonna need help,

31:52.999 --> 31:54.666
so grab some-some big,
burly drill dudes

31:54.668 --> 31:56.234
and get to the cellar deck.

31:56.236 --> 31:57.636
I'm tracking your movements.
I'll call you

31:57.638 --> 31:58.637
when you get there.

31:58.639 --> 32:01.273
You got 11 minutes.

32:01.275 --> 32:04.409
Remember that agent-in-training,
the fourth one?

32:04.411 --> 32:05.977
He may have a way to stop
this thing from blowing.

32:05.979 --> 32:08.212
Great. What do we do?
You got 11 minutes

32:08.214 --> 32:10.648
to get up that vent
and get the crew off the rig.

32:10.650 --> 32:11.915
You're not coming on the boats?

32:11.917 --> 32:13.150
Look, this thing blows up,

32:13.152 --> 32:14.518
oil coats the Gulf again,

32:14.520 --> 32:16.053
it'll be a death blow
to the coast.

32:16.055 --> 32:17.521
Okay.
I'm not letting that happen.

32:17.523 --> 32:18.589
What is that?

32:18.591 --> 32:21.024
Torch.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.459
Yeah.

32:22.461 --> 32:24.061
They're cutting their
way in. Go now.

32:24.063 --> 32:25.295
You can't do this alone.

32:25.297 --> 32:26.629
I'm not gonna.

32:26.631 --> 32:28.598
Look, we all got to do our part,
Bonnie.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.866
You got to get this crew
to safety. Now go.

32:30.868 --> 32:32.702
You're a strange dude, Pride.

32:35.473 --> 32:37.407
Hauser,

32:37.409 --> 32:40.610
listen up!
Turn off the blowtorch!

32:40.612 --> 32:43.478
I'm comin' out.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.980
And you're gonna listen
to every word I have to say.

32:45.982 --> 32:48.250
And why exactly will we do that?

32:49.786 --> 32:52.287
'Cause this rig's gonna blow
in the next ten minutes,

32:52.289 --> 32:55.324
and I'm the only one
who knows how to stop it.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.567
Well, you got our attention.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.436
Better talk quick.

33:24.209 --> 33:26.876
This is a bunch of crap. He's
bluffing so Bonnie can get away.

33:26.967 --> 33:28.847
You got bigger problems
to worry about than her.

33:29.339 --> 33:30.938
This rig's goin' up
in a fireball

33:30.940 --> 33:32.673
if we don't do something
about it.

33:32.675 --> 33:34.707
If this place were gonna blow,
we'd be hearing sirens.

33:34.709 --> 33:36.276
Refresh
your computer.

33:36.278 --> 33:39.612
Warning system
should come back online.

33:40.749 --> 33:42.215
Whoever you were working with

33:42.217 --> 33:44.217
to sabotage the pipeline
set you up.

33:44.219 --> 33:47.454
Looking to clean up their mess.
You three included.

33:49.791 --> 33:51.257
He's right.

33:51.259 --> 33:53.392
Bottom hole pressure's
off the charts,

33:53.394 --> 33:55.494
and the preventer's offline.
Can you override it?

33:55.496 --> 33:56.462
Not from here.

33:56.464 --> 33:58.431
We got, like, nine minutes!

33:58.433 --> 33:59.532
We got to get to the lifeboats.

33:59.534 --> 34:00.599
No, Bonnie and the crew
took 'em.

34:00.601 --> 34:02.768
You got no other option
but to help me.

34:02.770 --> 34:05.637
Just a couple holes
in the pipeline, huh?

34:05.639 --> 34:07.372
Do it for my family.

34:07.374 --> 34:09.274
Isn't that what
you said, Hauser?

34:09.275 --> 34:10.408
Uh-uh, this is his fault.

34:10.409 --> 34:11.775
Keep waving that weapon
in my face,

34:11.777 --> 34:13.110
I'll feed it to you.

34:16.283 --> 34:18.014
You said
you know how to stop it?

34:18.016 --> 34:19.516
Get me to the cellar deck.
I'll show you.

34:25.558 --> 34:28.458
Talk to me, Sebastian.
Okay,

34:28.460 --> 34:29.793
all you guys need to do

34:29.795 --> 34:32.529
is activate
the blowout preventer...

34:33.799 --> 34:34.797
...to seal the pipe

34:34.800 --> 34:36.533
and prevent
an underwater blowout.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.034
That's easy, right?

34:40.539 --> 34:43.339
Now, two lucky contestants
are gonna climb down

34:43.341 --> 34:44.639
to the blowout preventer.

34:44.641 --> 34:46.809
Pride, it's a long way down.

34:46.811 --> 34:48.077
You better hurry.

34:48.079 --> 34:49.277
Got you.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.746
Let's go, Hauser.

34:54.752 --> 34:56.085
You guys up on the top,

34:56.087 --> 34:57.820
you have to wait
until they surface

34:57.822 --> 35:00.188
before you close the hatch,
turn the valves,

35:00.190 --> 35:02.290
and seal the well. If you don't,
you're gonna kill them.

35:02.292 --> 35:04.626
All right, Pride,
I see you down there.

35:04.628 --> 35:06.094
Look for two control panels.

35:07.431 --> 35:09.598
One blue and one yellow.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.300
Now, this part is super
important. You have to turn

35:12.302 --> 35:14.836
the activation keys
at the same time.

35:14.838 --> 35:17.804
It's taking too long.
We can't wait!

35:17.806 --> 35:19.573
That clock hits five,
I'm doin' it.

35:19.575 --> 35:21.842
One, two, three.

35:21.844 --> 35:23.210
Then book it up the ladder

35:23.212 --> 35:24.678
before the clock strikes zero.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.383
I'm doin' it. Close the hatch.

35:29.385 --> 35:30.917
Yeah. I'm with you!

35:30.919 --> 35:31.918
They're almost up!

35:31.920 --> 35:33.453
Don't! Just-just wait!

35:33.455 --> 35:34.855
They're coming.
They're right there.

35:36.458 --> 35:38.824
Get out of there, guys.
You got ten seconds.

35:38.826 --> 35:40.326
Eight seconds.

35:40.328 --> 35:43.029
Six seconds.

35:43.031 --> 35:46.266
All right, close the hatch!
Close the hatch!

35:47.435 --> 35:49.101
We're closed! Hit it!

35:52.839 --> 35:54.939
We're clear.

36:01.615 --> 36:05.384
So... what now?

36:08.954 --> 36:10.821
I have to arrest you

36:10.823 --> 36:12.923
for the murder
of Lieutenant Nielsen.

36:14.093 --> 36:17.895
And how do you plan to do that?

36:17.897 --> 36:19.096
Hands up, jackass.

36:20.933 --> 36:23.033
That's how.

36:23.035 --> 36:25.635
Probably should've
held on to that gun.

36:26.471 --> 36:28.338
You're back, huh?

36:28.340 --> 36:30.407
Everybody's got to do
their part.

36:30.409 --> 36:32.475
Mine wasn't over.

36:32.477 --> 36:34.344
Well, I owe you one.

36:34.346 --> 36:38.348
Give me five minutes with these
morons, we'll call it even.

36:56.634 --> 36:59.400
Lund.

36:59.402 --> 37:01.135
I'm gonna tell you something.

37:01.137 --> 37:03.271
No, you know what,
I'm gonna tell you something.

37:03.273 --> 37:04.872
Yeah, I disobeyed
a direct order.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.907
But guess what,
I don't give a damn.

37:06.909 --> 37:09.410
If becoming an agent means
abandoning my team

37:09.412 --> 37:10.845
when they need me the most,
well,

37:10.847 --> 37:12.580
then you can take that badge
and you can sh...

37:12.582 --> 37:14.181
Lund!

37:14.950 --> 37:16.283
You did good.

37:16.285 --> 37:17.917
Come again?

37:17.919 --> 37:19.953
Remember what I told you
when I chased you up the rope?

37:19.955 --> 37:22.522
That I needed to find a way
to motivate my butt up it?

37:22.524 --> 37:25.592
You were willing to sacrifice
your badge for your team.

37:25.594 --> 37:27.461
You found it.

37:27.463 --> 37:29.329
Training works good, doesn't it?

37:30.290 --> 37:31.865
Now get back to
the gym. You owe me

37:31.866 --> 37:33.299
50 laps for breaking the rules.

37:33.301 --> 37:34.333
Sir, yes, sir.

37:36.371 --> 37:39.037
Move it!

37:40.675 --> 37:44.143
<i>It was just</i>
<i>a couple holes in the pipeline.</i>

37:44.145 --> 37:46.245
Which turned into the murder
of a Navy officer

37:46.247 --> 37:48.216
and the attempted murder
of 24 of your rig workers.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.566
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

37:49.567 --> 37:51.317
Well, that's what
they all say.

37:51.318 --> 37:54.051
I was trying
to keep the company afloat.

37:54.053 --> 37:58.055
And nearly destroyed
the entire Gulf in the process.

37:58.057 --> 38:00.725
Imagine what that would've
done to your mama.

38:00.727 --> 38:04.496
I've disappointed her
every day of my life.

38:04.498 --> 38:07.164
And all I ever wanted
was her respect.

38:07.166 --> 38:10.701
Thought if I saved her precious
company, I-I'd finally get it.

38:10.703 --> 38:12.536
Well,
I'll promise you one thing,

38:12.538 --> 38:15.506
you'll have plenty of time to
work through those mommy issues

38:15.508 --> 38:18.141
with the prison counselor
at Angola.

38:22.380 --> 38:23.879
I'll call DHS,

38:23.881 --> 38:25.548
have them pick him up
for processing.

38:25.550 --> 38:27.283
Gregorio.

38:27.285 --> 38:28.718
You did good in there.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.186
Thanks.

38:30.188 --> 38:31.821
You weren't so bad yourself.

38:32.857 --> 38:35.658
Roy, will... you
give us a minute?

38:37.061 --> 38:38.494
Hey, look, Lasalle,

38:38.496 --> 38:41.029
I know we've been butting heads
but today was like...

38:41.031 --> 38:42.497
A huge success.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.133
It was.

38:45.135 --> 38:46.802
I mean, after all,
we took down the bad guys,

38:46.804 --> 38:48.169
and at the end of the day,

38:48.171 --> 38:49.871
that's all that really matters,
right?

38:49.873 --> 38:52.708
Right, but still, we were
at each other's throats.

38:52.710 --> 38:55.410
It's growing pains,
ancient history.

38:55.412 --> 38:57.511
History tends to repeat itself.

38:57.513 --> 38:59.313
As far as I'm concerned,

38:59.315 --> 39:01.281
we were arguing
'cause we both cared,

39:01.283 --> 39:03.584
and that's a good thing.

39:03.586 --> 39:05.753
All right, I'm down with that.

39:05.755 --> 39:07.788
Still, it happened.

39:07.790 --> 39:11.459
So, you think we can spare Pride
the gory details, or what?

39:11.461 --> 39:14.461
It's just another day
at the office down here.

39:14.463 --> 39:15.762
Bottom line,

39:15.764 --> 39:18.631
is he doesn't need to know
anything about today.

39:21.102 --> 39:24.404
- Hello? Anybody home?
- Hey!

39:24.406 --> 39:25.872
- Hey, man!
- There he is!

39:25.874 --> 39:27.741
Hey, good to see
you in one piece.

39:27.743 --> 39:28.975
You are in one piece?

39:28.977 --> 39:31.042
Oh, yeah,
it's just a flesh wound.

39:31.044 --> 39:33.945
Could've been a lot worse
if it hadn't been for you all.

39:33.947 --> 39:35.283
You did a good job
without me.

39:35.307 --> 39:37.083
Oh, yeah.

39:37.084 --> 39:39.785
This was seamless.
It was like a well-oiled

39:39.787 --> 39:41.953
but extremely loud machine.

39:41.955 --> 39:43.555
Do I want to
know what that means?

39:43.557 --> 39:45.624
It means we're glad
to have you back,

39:45.626 --> 39:47.658
calling the shots.
Yeah.

39:47.660 --> 39:50.194
Okay. In that case,

39:50.196 --> 39:52.797
I say we forget the
paperwork, go get a drink.

39:52.799 --> 39:53.308
Oh!

39:53.332 --> 39:54.767
Yes. Now you're talkin'
my language.

39:54.768 --> 39:55.554
First round's on me.

39:55.578 --> 39:57.068
I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

39:57.069 --> 39:58.483
It's my gentlemanly responsibility.

39:58.507 --> 40:00.238
Literally makes me nauseous

40:00.239 --> 40:01.194
when you talk like that.

40:01.218 --> 40:02.908
