WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:07.000
Someone was looking
for Navy secrets.

00:07.043 --> 00:08.347
GIBBS: It's a list.TONY: Of what?

00:08.391 --> 00:09.521
ZIVA:
Every Navy warship

00:09.565 --> 00:11.695
that contains
the faulty wiring.

00:11.739 --> 00:13.043
You find something?

00:13.086 --> 00:15.130
Found an explosive device
hidden on a pallet.

00:17.826 --> 00:19.521
Who put you up to this,
Fullerton?

00:19.565 --> 00:20.521
His name's Harper Dearing.

00:20.565 --> 00:21.826
McGEE:
Harper Dearing.

00:21.869 --> 00:23.869
He's the CEO
of Dorado Hills Investments.

00:23.913 --> 00:25.217
May I help you?Where's Dearing?

00:25.260 --> 00:26.652
We have a warrant
for his arrest.

00:26.695 --> 00:28.565
Look, I haven't seen or heard
from him in over a year.

00:28.608 --> 00:30.521
You said Dearing had a son
that was in the Navy.

00:30.565 --> 00:31.695
Did you get a DNA match?

00:31.739 --> 00:32.826
They found
a familial match.

00:32.869 --> 00:35.521
There is 99.9% probability

00:35.565 --> 00:36.869
that Harper Dearing
is your guy.

00:36.913 --> 00:38.043
Harper Dearing.

00:38.086 --> 00:40.000
Let's go!
We got work to do.

00:42.826 --> 00:44.913
Uh-huh. And then
what happened?

00:44.956 --> 00:46.956
[mumbling]

00:47.000 --> 00:48.956
Ah, you must have
been pretty scared.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.391
How badly
did she hurt you?

00:50.434 --> 00:51.826
[mumbling]

00:51.869 --> 00:53.869
Mmm, you were lucky.

00:53.913 --> 00:55.260
[mumbling]

00:55.304 --> 00:56.956
Yeah, you can
say that again.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.391
Got it.

01:00.086 --> 01:02.434
Oh, yeah, you definitely
fractured your implant.

01:02.478 --> 01:03.869
Looks like a
popcorn kernel.

01:03.913 --> 01:05.043
I can see the pieces.

01:05.086 --> 01:06.956
A popcorn kernel?
Oh, yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.608
Happens all the time.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.869
Most people don't realize
the tensile strength of the...

01:13.869 --> 01:15.217
What's wrong?

01:15.260 --> 01:16.739
This implant
isn't solid.

01:16.782 --> 01:18.608
No wonder you fractured it.

01:23.956 --> 01:26.869
Was that in my tooth?

01:26.913 --> 01:28.956
Wait.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.217
Did somebody bug my mouth?

01:31.260 --> 01:32.956
What did you say you did again?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.347
I had no idea you
were this anal.

02:12.391 --> 02:14.304
Even the inside
has to be cleaned?

02:14.347 --> 02:16.304
No. Line's been staticky.

02:16.347 --> 02:18.086
Think there's dust
on my circuit board.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.782
No room for error this week.

02:19.826 --> 02:20.826
Well, careful
you don't

02:20.869 --> 02:22.260
electrocute yourself
over there.

02:22.304 --> 02:23.913
It's impossible.

02:23.956 --> 02:25.956
System uses
low-voltage DC current.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.565
It's interesting-- you seem
proud to know this information.

02:29.695 --> 02:30.956
He's... he's back.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.521
How many bodies
did you say you found?

02:32.565 --> 02:34.043
Now, calm down.
Tell me again,

02:34.086 --> 02:36.739
what floor was
the explosion on?

02:39.391 --> 02:41.739
I thought I heard it ring.

02:41.782 --> 02:42.956
Oh, come on.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.782
You guys, just give me one hint

02:44.826 --> 02:46.695
as to what Abby
has planned.

02:46.739 --> 02:47.913
It is my bachelor party, okay?

02:47.956 --> 02:48.869
I've got a right to know.

02:48.913 --> 02:50.217
Sorry. She swore
us to secrecy,

02:50.260 --> 02:52.043
and she scares me more than you.

02:52.086 --> 02:53.434
God.

02:53.478 --> 02:55.739
Think I made a big mistake
making her my best man.

02:55.782 --> 02:57.521
Relax, Jimmy.
Everything's fine.

02:57.565 --> 02:59.217
Just make sure
you're up on your

02:59.260 --> 03:01.000
hepatitis vaccinations.Hepatitis?

03:01.043 --> 03:03.217
And get a good pair
of knee pads.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.086
And a good helmet.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.608
[laughing]

03:06.652 --> 03:08.956
You guys are messing with me.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.739
Are we? Two words.

03:10.782 --> 03:12.086
Abby Sciuto.

03:18.043 --> 03:19.869
What is Abby
planning?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.956
You know, I'm still
not really sure.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.391
But maybe Ziva knows.

03:24.434 --> 03:25.956
Ziva,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.130
what is Abby
planning?

03:27.173 --> 03:28.739
I have a statement
from the dentist

03:28.782 --> 03:29.956
and the evidence.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.782
Agent Gibbs, I have
no clue what's going on,

03:31.826 --> 03:33.869
but I can assure you...You better hope you can.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.304
Hey.

03:36.347 --> 03:38.347
Stay.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.347
I called Gibbs.
He called Ziva.
And?

03:44.391 --> 03:47.739
And I think I'm in
a lot of trouble.

03:47.782 --> 03:49.695
It's definitely
some kind

03:49.739 --> 03:51.347
of acoustic
listening device.

03:51.391 --> 03:53.565
Somebody thinks Dorneget's
more interesting than we do.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.130
ZIVA: Agent Dorneget
said the implant

03:55.173 --> 03:57.086
had been there
for years.
DUCKY:
Never.

03:57.130 --> 03:59.608
That device wouldn't last
more than a couple of months

03:59.652 --> 04:02.217
in a place as inhospitable
as the human mouth.

04:02.260 --> 04:03.782
GIBBS: He have any work
done recently?

04:03.826 --> 04:05.478
ZIVA: Actually, two weeks ago.
Dorneget's regular dentist

04:05.521 --> 04:07.869
called and said there was
a recall on his implant

04:07.913 --> 04:09.434
and that it needed
to be replaced.

04:09.478 --> 04:11.173
GIBBS: Did he?ZIVA: Yes, and then, yesterday,

04:11.217 --> 04:12.913
that replacement
was knocked loose by...

04:12.956 --> 04:14.173
Popcorn kernel.

04:14.217 --> 04:15.695
I can see the pieces.

04:15.739 --> 04:17.086
He tried to go back
to see his dentist,

04:17.130 --> 04:18.695
but he wouldn't
return his calls.

04:18.739 --> 04:20.000
The plot thickens.

04:20.043 --> 04:22.043
ZIVA: So he went to
see a new dentist,

04:22.086 --> 04:24.391
and he discovered the...
[clicks tongue] bug.

04:24.434 --> 04:26.391
Can you trace
the signal, Abbs?

04:26.434 --> 04:29.739
ABBY: A unit that small
would be really short-range.

04:29.782 --> 04:31.130
It probably used
Dorneget's cell phone

04:31.173 --> 04:32.478
as a booster.

04:32.521 --> 04:33.826
I'll have to look.

04:34.869 --> 04:36.478
Holy molar!

04:36.521 --> 04:37.913
What?

04:37.956 --> 04:38.826
Graphene.

04:38.869 --> 04:40.695
That's the
electrical source.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.869
And it looks
like it's acting

04:42.913 --> 04:45.043
as a piezoelectric substrate.

04:45.086 --> 04:46.347
It's genius.

04:46.391 --> 04:47.521
If you say so.

04:47.565 --> 04:50.173
Piezoelectricity
is the conversion

04:50.217 --> 04:52.782
of pressure
into an electric current.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.043
So, every time
Dorneget would chew...

04:55.086 --> 04:57.608
The pressure on the graphene
charged the battery.

04:57.652 --> 04:58.782
It's brilliant.

04:58.826 --> 05:00.391
Someone should
patent this.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.782
Maybe somebody did.

05:03.565 --> 05:05.521
I like how you think.

05:10.913 --> 05:12.739
Got a hit.

05:12.782 --> 05:14.913
Patent was filed for
18 months ago.

05:14.956 --> 05:16.130
By who?

05:18.956 --> 05:20.043
Harper Dearing.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.391
Oh, dear.

05:21.434 --> 05:24.000
The newest addition
on our Most Wanted Wall.

05:24.043 --> 05:27.086
And I just got my blood pressure
under control.

05:34.304 --> 05:36.173
McGEE: Harper Dearing,
61 years old.

05:36.217 --> 05:39.434
CEO of a multinational
venture capital group

05:39.478 --> 05:40.782
headquartered out of Virginia.

05:40.826 --> 05:42.260
That is, of course,
his day job.

05:42.304 --> 05:43.739
TONY:
He's been very busy

05:43.782 --> 05:44.869
building up
a new résumé.

05:44.913 --> 05:46.130
First, he burns
down warehouses.

05:46.173 --> 05:48.434
ZIVA: Then almost blows up
two Navy ships.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.826
Then he steals
Dorneget's molar.

05:49.869 --> 05:51.391
We're looking for him;
he's watching us.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.043
ZIVA: If Dearing
wanted to keep an eye

05:53.086 --> 05:54.434
on our investigation,

05:54.478 --> 05:56.043
then why bug
a probationary agent?

05:56.086 --> 05:57.739
McGEE:
Dorneget's a floater

05:57.782 --> 05:59.434
in every department,
and he's a talker.

05:59.478 --> 06:00.869
If Dearing had bugged Gibbs...

06:00.913 --> 06:01.956
RYAN:
All he'd hear

06:02.000 --> 06:03.217
is wood being sanded.

06:04.260 --> 06:05.695
Hi.

06:05.739 --> 06:07.739
Something told me
you could use my help.

06:09.043 --> 06:10.782
So I brought some.

06:12.391 --> 06:13.652
Ah.

06:13.695 --> 06:15.391
You're wondering
how I knew.

06:15.434 --> 06:17.130
A girl's gotta have
her secrets.

06:17.173 --> 06:18.826
Mine is: I can read your mind.

06:20.043 --> 06:21.826
RYAN:
So, since our

06:21.869 --> 06:24.782
CEO-turned-terrorist
has gone MIA,

06:24.826 --> 06:27.043
his company's been
run by its president,

06:27.086 --> 06:29.782
a man named
Vincent Maple.

06:29.826 --> 06:31.565
Wink.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.913
Go for it.

06:32.956 --> 06:34.608
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

06:34.652 --> 06:36.391
RYAN:
I brought you NSA intercepts

06:36.434 --> 06:37.565
of Dearing's
last communications

06:37.608 --> 06:39.782
with Maple
from a year ago.

06:39.826 --> 06:40.826
Thought they might help.

06:40.869 --> 06:43.652
DiNozzo, Ziva,
talk to Maple.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.434
See if there's been
any new contact.

06:45.478 --> 06:46.913
McGee...I'll pick up the dentist

06:46.956 --> 06:48.739
that put in Dorneget's
fake tooth. On it.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.391
GIBBS:
How'd you know?

06:54.434 --> 06:56.173
Fine, you big baby.

06:56.217 --> 06:59.260
DoD flagged Abby's search
of the patent office.

06:59.304 --> 07:00.565
Dearing's public
enemy number one.

07:00.608 --> 07:01.782
We're all
looking for him.

07:01.826 --> 07:03.086
Could have told me.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.913
Yeah... where's
the fun in that?

07:04.956 --> 07:06.913
Stick around, Doc.

07:06.956 --> 07:08.826
I think you could end
up being helpful.

07:08.869 --> 07:10.260
Yeah, I already
cleared it with SECNAV.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.173
Hey, I told you
I could read your mind.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.695
MAPLE: I don't care what customs says.

07:16.739 --> 07:19.652
No, we need those containers
on the shipping platform ASAP.

07:19.695 --> 07:21.695
Call me back to confirm.

07:21.739 --> 07:23.434
Sorry to keep you waiting.

07:23.478 --> 07:25.434
We heard.And I already
told NCIS

07:25.478 --> 07:26.826
everything that I
know last week.

07:26.869 --> 07:28.173
I mean...

07:28.217 --> 07:30.391
Yeah, yeah, go for Maple.

07:30.434 --> 07:31.913
He'll call you back.[headset beeps off]

07:31.956 --> 07:34.173
All right, can we just...
can we just make this quick?

07:34.217 --> 07:35.304
You told NCIS,

07:35.347 --> 07:36.565
since Dearing disappeared,

07:36.608 --> 07:38.043
you've been running
the company by yourself.

07:38.086 --> 07:39.478
Yeah, all by myself.

07:39.521 --> 07:41.260
And you have no clue
where he went.

07:41.304 --> 07:42.913
You care to
explain this?

07:43.913 --> 07:45.217
The last e-mail communication

07:45.260 --> 07:46.869
between you and Dearing.

07:46.913 --> 07:49.043
He says, "I am
enjoying a mai tai

07:49.086 --> 07:51.652
on the beach where you and I
had gone surfing."

07:51.695 --> 07:53.260
Seems like a clue to me.

07:53.304 --> 07:55.347
Uh, well, no, not really.
I mean, I didn't mention it

07:55.391 --> 07:57.173
because I had no idea
what he was talking about.

07:57.217 --> 07:59.173
We never went surfing.
I'm not exactly

07:59.217 --> 08:00.347
a beach kind of person.

08:00.391 --> 08:01.826
Sand is itchy.

08:01.869 --> 08:03.391
[chuckling]Guys, look,
I'm cooperating, okay?

08:03.434 --> 08:05.260
He may be my boss,
but I actually have

08:05.304 --> 08:06.826
family serving
on Navy ships right now.

08:06.869 --> 08:08.043
Mm-hmm.

08:08.086 --> 08:10.434
Well, you think
this reference to surfing

08:10.478 --> 08:12.391
might be code?

08:12.434 --> 08:13.826
I... who knows?

08:13.869 --> 08:15.782
I mean, look, Dearing
had been saying odd things

08:15.826 --> 08:17.478
for months
before he disappeared.

08:17.521 --> 08:18.913
Uh...

08:18.956 --> 08:20.826
I think he might be losing it.

08:20.869 --> 08:23.347
I think that boat
has already sailed.

08:23.391 --> 08:24.869
"Ship," but yeah.

08:24.913 --> 08:26.956
Close.

08:36.739 --> 08:38.347
I'm Special Agent Gibbs.

08:38.391 --> 08:40.695
And I'm here to tell
if you're lying.

08:40.739 --> 08:42.782
Am I under arrest?

08:42.826 --> 08:44.347
Why? Should you be?
No.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.521
But your agents didn't say
what you wanted to talk about.

08:46.565 --> 08:48.173
It's funny you didn't ask.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.260
He a patient of yours?

08:54.565 --> 08:56.130
Um, I'm sorry--
I can't discuss that.

08:56.173 --> 08:57.739
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

08:57.782 --> 08:58.782
Waiver.

08:59.869 --> 09:01.608
Yes, uh, he's a patient.

09:01.652 --> 09:03.869
I replaced a molar
implant of his,

09:03.913 --> 09:05.130
uh, two weeks ago.

09:05.173 --> 09:07.260
I had some concerns
about sterility issues

09:07.304 --> 09:09.434
with the manufacturer and
was just being cautious.

09:09.478 --> 09:11.043
You aware that your
replacement implant

09:11.086 --> 09:12.565
had a bug in it?

09:13.608 --> 09:14.826
[laughs]

09:14.869 --> 09:15.956
No.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.217
He's lying.

09:17.260 --> 09:19.347
No, I'm not.

09:19.391 --> 09:20.826
Suppose you don't know
who he is, either.

09:20.869 --> 09:22.782
No, I've never seen
him before in my life.

09:22.826 --> 09:24.695
Lying.
I'm not lying.

09:24.739 --> 09:26.043
Look, Ned was
a patient.

09:26.086 --> 09:27.608
I replaced an implant--
end of story.

09:27.652 --> 09:29.608
Now, I don't know anything
about any... any bugs.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.043
I certainly don't know
who that is.

09:31.086 --> 09:33.782
[knocking on door,
door opens]

09:33.826 --> 09:34.913
Sorry to interrupt.

09:34.956 --> 09:35.956
There's a call for Dr. Berman.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.913
Take a message.

09:37.956 --> 09:39.130
Um, boss, it's Dearing.

09:39.173 --> 09:41.652
He's on the screen
in MTAC.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.347
Let's go.

09:53.478 --> 09:55.695
Hello, Dr. Berman.

09:57.869 --> 10:00.347
You recognize him now?

10:00.391 --> 10:02.695
I, um... [chuckles]

10:02.739 --> 10:04.782
No point in lying now, Doctor.

10:04.826 --> 10:07.565
You have my permission
to tell NCIS

10:07.608 --> 10:09.173
whatever they want to hear.

10:09.217 --> 10:12.956
Your cooperation may well carry
some weight with the judge.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.826
How gracious.

10:14.869 --> 10:17.043
I try to be considerate,
Dr. Ryan.

10:17.086 --> 10:19.869
Mark Twain said,
"Always do right.

10:19.913 --> 10:24.347
This will gratify some people
and astonish the rest."

10:24.391 --> 10:26.565
Is that why you called?

10:26.608 --> 10:28.347
To quote Twain
to your dentist?

10:28.391 --> 10:30.434
Agent Gibbs,
nice to finally meet you.

10:30.478 --> 10:32.565
No, I did not call

10:32.608 --> 10:35.434
specifically to speak
to Dr. Berman.

10:35.478 --> 10:38.782
I called specifically
to speak with you.

10:39.869 --> 10:41.391
RYAN:
About?

10:41.434 --> 10:43.826
It's important to know
thy enemy, don't you think?

10:43.869 --> 10:44.956
I'm not your enemy.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.608
[Dearing chuckling]

10:46.652 --> 10:49.478
Says the man who'd certainly
kill me if he had the chance.

10:49.521 --> 10:50.956
Turn yourself in.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.217
Nobody else
needs to die.

10:53.260 --> 10:55.782
Well, that's where
you're wrong, Agent.

10:55.826 --> 11:00.478
People die for a cause
every minute of every day.

11:00.521 --> 11:02.565
RYAN:
These are innocent

11:02.608 --> 11:04.260
Navy personnel being targeted.

11:04.304 --> 11:05.869
Explain the cause.

11:05.913 --> 11:07.565
Ask Agent Gibbs.

11:08.739 --> 11:11.043
After all,
this is all his fault.

11:11.086 --> 11:14.217
I called because I think
you should know that.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.260
[indistinct conversations,
scanners blipping]

11:30.086 --> 11:32.000
What did we miss?I don't know,

11:32.043 --> 11:34.521
but looks like Dorneget's
about to wet my chair.

11:34.565 --> 11:35.826
RYAN: Now, you're sure
you didn't discuss

11:35.869 --> 11:37.043
any classified material

11:37.086 --> 11:38.782
in the last two weeks?No.

11:38.826 --> 11:40.565
Wait.

11:40.608 --> 11:41.695
Is that a trick question?

11:41.739 --> 11:43.565
No, she didn't
ask one yet.

11:44.608 --> 11:45.913
Maybe that's the trick.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.478
How'd Dearing know
the dentist was here?

11:47.521 --> 11:48.652
[sighs]

11:48.695 --> 11:49.913
We're sweeping
the entire building

11:49.956 --> 11:51.695
for more bugs, Agent Gibbs.I want to know

11:51.739 --> 11:53.434
how Dearing punched
through MTAC's firewall.

11:53.478 --> 11:55.347
ZIVA:
Dearing was in MTAC?

11:55.391 --> 11:57.304
Oh, yeah, bigger than hell.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.260
Dorneget,
get out of here.

12:01.739 --> 12:03.478
Did you learn anything
from Maple?

12:03.521 --> 12:04.565
Well, Dearing's nuts.

12:04.608 --> 12:06.217
RYAN:
Not nuts.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.086
Just a sociopathic,
paranoid narcissist.

12:08.130 --> 12:09.695
JIMMY: I don't know
why Abby asked you

12:09.739 --> 12:11.000
what kind of tattoo I want.

12:11.043 --> 12:13.000
I'm not getting
a tattoo, Breena. I...

12:14.521 --> 12:16.434
Did you say dragon?

12:16.478 --> 12:18.043
Because a dragon
would be kind of cool.

12:18.086 --> 12:19.434
Boss, talked to the dentist.

12:19.478 --> 12:21.130
Did he talk back?
He sang
like a canary

12:21.173 --> 12:22.608
after the call to Dearing.

12:22.652 --> 12:24.695
Did he admit to
bugging Dorneget?
Yeah.

12:24.739 --> 12:26.434
But he claims
that he was forced to.

12:26.478 --> 12:28.173
He said one of Dearing's guys
roughed him up.

12:28.217 --> 12:29.521
Told him
if he didn't

12:29.565 --> 12:31.391
implant the bug,
they'd kill him.

12:31.434 --> 12:32.521
Dearing paid him for
his troubles, though--

12:32.565 --> 12:34.173
ten grand in cash.

12:34.217 --> 12:35.521
You get a description?Even better.

12:37.956 --> 12:39.913
DiNozzo, BOLO.On it.

12:39.956 --> 12:41.434
Ziva, get down to Abby.

12:41.478 --> 12:42.608
Give her the money.

12:42.652 --> 12:44.304
See if she can
pull prints off it.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.869
Hey.

12:45.913 --> 12:47.826
No matter what
Dearing said,

12:47.869 --> 12:49.521
you know this isn't
your fault, right?

12:49.565 --> 12:50.521
Yeah, yeah, I know.

12:50.565 --> 12:52.173
Unfortunately,
I get the sense

12:52.217 --> 12:54.565
that Dearing actually
believes it.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.695
Hey.

13:01.434 --> 13:03.000
I know.

13:09.260 --> 13:10.565
[panting]

13:10.608 --> 13:12.130
Hi, Abby.

13:12.173 --> 13:13.565
Hi, Jimmy.

13:13.608 --> 13:15.521
So, I was just thinking

13:15.565 --> 13:18.347
that with all of this stuff
that's going on right now,

13:18.391 --> 13:20.478
maybe tomorrow night
isn't such a good idea.

13:20.521 --> 13:22.217
We're not canceling
your bachelor party.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.521
What? No, no, no.

13:23.565 --> 13:25.173
Who said cancel?I already
put down

13:25.217 --> 13:27.478
a nonrefundable deposit
on 50 gallons

13:27.521 --> 13:28.869
of scented body lotion, so...

13:29.913 --> 13:31.652
Just, uh... just postpone

13:31.695 --> 13:34.608
for a long, long...
long time.

13:34.652 --> 13:35.956
Or longer.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.217
Look.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.652
I know, with
ships blowing up

13:39.695 --> 13:41.826
and a crazy terrorist
on the loose,

13:41.869 --> 13:45.565
that it seems like the worst
possible time for a party.

13:45.608 --> 13:46.782
Yes, I couldn't
agree more.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.521
But if there's one thing
that we've learned

13:49.565 --> 13:50.782
working around
all this death,

13:50.826 --> 13:53.043
is that life must go on.

13:53.086 --> 13:55.565
Right, and, uh...

13:55.608 --> 13:58.608
what exactly does life
going on entail exactly?

13:58.652 --> 14:00.304
With details.

14:00.347 --> 14:01.565
Just trust me.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.086
It'll be a night
that you'll never forget.

14:03.130 --> 14:05.434
Assuming you don't
have some sort

14:05.478 --> 14:07.608
of head trauma
with memory loss or...

14:07.652 --> 14:10.173
Okay, oh, just...
the joke is over.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.260
The joke is over!

14:11.304 --> 14:12.739
I need to know what
you have planned

14:12.782 --> 14:13.782
for my bachelor party.

14:14.826 --> 14:17.260
No, you want to know.

14:17.304 --> 14:18.695
If you needed
to know,

14:18.739 --> 14:19.913
I would tell you.

14:19.956 --> 14:21.130
[computer beeping]
I...
Hold that thought.

14:21.173 --> 14:23.434
I got a hit on my facial
recognition program.

14:23.478 --> 14:25.000
Bachelor party or case?

14:25.043 --> 14:26.652
Case.
Thank God.

14:26.695 --> 14:27.826
I've been running
Dearing's face

14:27.869 --> 14:29.130
against every database
I can think of.

14:29.173 --> 14:31.565
Like, traffic lights,
airport cameras.

14:31.608 --> 14:33.043
He's been laying
low, but I thought,

14:33.086 --> 14:34.652
if I could find out
where he's been...

14:34.695 --> 14:36.521
You might find out
where he went.

14:36.565 --> 14:37.652
So, where's he been?

14:37.695 --> 14:39.043
Jimmy!

14:39.086 --> 14:40.521
That's a Navy Yard camera.

14:40.565 --> 14:41.782
Dearing was on the Navy Yard?

14:41.826 --> 14:43.043
No, not "was."

14:43.086 --> 14:44.304
That's a live feed.

14:44.347 --> 14:46.043
Dearing is
on the Navy Yard.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.739
Right now.

14:47.782 --> 14:49.652
TONY: That's right, a total lockdown.

14:49.695 --> 14:51.565
Every gate, window
and access tunnel.

14:51.608 --> 14:53.608
Start a perimeter search--
two-man teams.

14:53.652 --> 14:54.739
TONY: Probably armed,
definitely dangerous.

14:54.782 --> 14:56.521
OFFICER:
Armed and dangerous. Yes,sir.

14:56.565 --> 14:59.347
[siren whoops]And we'll find him.
He couldn't have gone that far.

14:59.391 --> 15:00.956
GIBBS: Far enough. He didn't
come here to get caught.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.434
Anybody got anything?

15:02.478 --> 15:04.739
OFFICER: Sir, all stations
report no sightings.

15:04.782 --> 15:07.173
Continuing the lockdown
and search.

15:07.217 --> 15:08.521
Ziva.
Dearing signed in

15:08.565 --> 15:10.565
at the walk-in gate
as a civilian contractor.

15:10.608 --> 15:12.043
He had all the
necessary credentials.

15:12.086 --> 15:13.956
Not hard for a guy like him.ZIVA:
The guard says

15:14.000 --> 15:15.565
he left almost immediately
after he arrived.

15:15.608 --> 15:16.782
Did he bring anything in
with him?

15:16.826 --> 15:18.000
Just a briefcase.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.739
McGee, let's see the tape.
Dorneget.

15:19.782 --> 15:21.565
Supervise a sweep of
the surrounding area.

15:27.304 --> 15:28.608
TONY:
He wanted us to see him.

15:28.652 --> 15:30.608
ZIVA: Ryan did say
he was a narcissist.

15:34.869 --> 15:36.608
McGEE:
Could be a contact poison.

15:36.652 --> 15:37.739
Or another bug.

15:43.956 --> 15:46.478
Boss?

16:01.782 --> 16:03.608
That looks
just like...

16:03.652 --> 16:05.391
ZIVA:
Is that your boat?

16:05.434 --> 16:06.652
Yep.

16:06.695 --> 16:08.260
Right down to the spade rudder.

16:11.478 --> 16:13.478
RYAN:
You know he's just trying

16:13.521 --> 16:14.869
to get inside your head,

16:14.913 --> 16:16.173
throw you
off-balance.

16:16.217 --> 16:17.652
Noticed.

16:17.695 --> 16:19.304
You know,
I got to admit,

16:19.347 --> 16:21.130
I kind of like
his style.

16:21.173 --> 16:22.608
Well...

16:22.652 --> 16:25.478
that's because it's yours.

16:25.521 --> 16:27.434
Let's see.

16:27.478 --> 16:30.217
Either of us having any luck?

16:30.260 --> 16:32.739
No.

16:32.782 --> 16:34.869
Nope, solid as a rock.

16:34.913 --> 16:36.956
Which is a compliment to rocks.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.173
Need to know
what's making this guy tick.

16:40.217 --> 16:41.826
What's his endgame?

16:41.869 --> 16:44.217
Of course you do.

16:44.260 --> 16:47.260
Luckily,
that's my specialty.

16:50.478 --> 16:52.869
You know Dearing had a son
in the Navy, right?

16:52.913 --> 16:54.478
Yeah.

16:54.521 --> 16:57.173
Yeah, he was killed
in a suicide attack

16:57.217 --> 16:59.652
on board ship while
it was in port.

16:59.695 --> 17:01.608
Already looked
into it.

17:01.652 --> 17:03.739
That's not
the whole story.

17:06.739 --> 17:09.565
There was a defect
in an early warning system.

17:09.608 --> 17:11.217
Could have
stopped the attack.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.434
The Navy was in the middle
of replacing it

17:13.478 --> 17:15.347
on dozens of ships, but...

17:15.391 --> 17:17.652
But we were also
in the middle of a war.

17:17.695 --> 17:19.521
Mm-hmm. Only so much
they could do.

17:19.565 --> 17:22.695
My guess is,
Dearing doesn't see it that way.

17:22.739 --> 17:24.130
So this is about payback?

17:24.173 --> 17:25.434
Yeah, in a way.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.521
I mean,
all his attacks

17:26.565 --> 17:29.391
have exploited flaws
in the fleet.

17:29.434 --> 17:31.478
I think, in his mind,

17:31.521 --> 17:34.217
Dearing is trying
to teach the Navy a lesson.

17:34.260 --> 17:35.869
By killing more sailors?

17:35.913 --> 17:38.130
[laughs] Look, DiNozzo
said it-- he's nuts.

17:38.173 --> 17:39.652
And obsessed.

17:39.695 --> 17:43.173
That's why I think
he's fixated on you.

17:45.347 --> 17:47.260
Aside from your handsomeness.

17:48.304 --> 17:49.695
Every hero

17:49.739 --> 17:50.913
needs a bad guy.

17:52.304 --> 17:53.434
And since
you're seemingly

17:53.478 --> 17:55.347
in charge
of the investigation...

17:55.391 --> 17:57.043
I'm the black hat.

17:57.086 --> 17:58.130
I think so.

17:58.173 --> 17:59.391
I-I... it's thin.

17:59.434 --> 18:01.478
I'm working on it,
but, uh...

18:01.521 --> 18:02.869
I'd be careful, Gibbs.

18:02.913 --> 18:05.130
I mean, the fact that Dearing
has gotten this close

18:05.173 --> 18:06.913
suggests he's got
something cooking.

18:06.956 --> 18:09.000
Something more substantial.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.652
How long you
know about this?

18:18.043 --> 18:21.434
Oh, I know about a lot
of things, Agent Gibbs.

18:21.478 --> 18:23.478
I share them when I think
they're relevant.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.478
Who decides that?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.869
[laughs]

18:27.913 --> 18:30.478
You are sounding
like a broken record.

18:30.521 --> 18:32.478
I would just like
some straight answers

18:32.521 --> 18:33.826
to straight questions.

18:33.869 --> 18:36.434
Like you to turn
it off for once.

18:36.478 --> 18:39.086
Well, it's, uh...

18:39.130 --> 18:41.869
it's not as easy
as you make it sound.

18:41.913 --> 18:45.260
[laughs] They may be
mind games to you,

18:45.304 --> 18:47.521
but my work is no game.

18:49.043 --> 18:51.956
Do you turn it off
when you come home, Gibbs?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.304
I've been in your basement.

18:54.347 --> 18:56.391
You don't turn anything off.

18:56.434 --> 18:58.652
You marinate in it.

18:59.782 --> 19:03.043
You want me to let you in?

19:03.086 --> 19:04.652
Then let me in.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.695
[phone ringing]

19:13.913 --> 19:15.347
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

19:15.391 --> 19:16.565
TONY:
Hi, boss.

19:16.608 --> 19:18.956
I didn't interrupt
anything, did I?

19:21.478 --> 19:23.130
Pretend I didn't ask.

19:23.173 --> 19:24.565
What, DiNozzo?

19:24.608 --> 19:26.478
BOLO came back on the guy

19:26.521 --> 19:28.173
who blackmailed
Dorneget's dentist.

19:28.217 --> 19:30.260
Local LEO found the car.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.304
Boss?

19:33.826 --> 19:35.695
Saved by the cell.

19:40.043 --> 19:41.043
TONY:
Telling you,

19:41.086 --> 19:42.043
Ryan was there.

19:42.086 --> 19:43.347
ZIVA:
So what if she was?

19:43.391 --> 19:44.608
I was happy to gossip

19:44.652 --> 19:45.782
when things were just
getting started,

19:45.826 --> 19:47.434
but now that they are a...
a couple,

19:47.478 --> 19:49.434
I think we should just back off.

19:49.478 --> 19:51.260
How are you
not interested

19:51.304 --> 19:52.739
in other people's
private lives?

19:52.782 --> 19:54.043
Okay, DiNozzo...

19:54.086 --> 19:56.043
What do you got?

19:58.217 --> 20:00.521
The vehicle is registered to
a man named Frederick Fountain.

20:00.565 --> 20:01.956
TONY:
He's a cop.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.478
Well, ex-cop.

20:03.521 --> 20:05.130
Was kicked off
the force for...

20:05.173 --> 20:06.478
taking bribes.

20:06.521 --> 20:09.130
[sniffs] Uh... he
served some time.

20:09.173 --> 20:10.478
[Tony sniffing]

20:12.521 --> 20:14.130
What?
Nothing.

20:14.173 --> 20:16.391
It's just that
you smell like...

20:16.434 --> 20:17.521
someone that isn't...

20:19.086 --> 20:20.304
...you.

20:20.347 --> 20:22.434
Um, did I mention he
served a little time?

20:22.478 --> 20:24.782
Yep, and he's about
to serve some more.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.695
ZIVA:
Uh-oh.

20:27.739 --> 20:29.347
He made us.

20:33.652 --> 20:34.478
Federal Agent! Freeze!

20:37.434 --> 20:38.695
Was it something we said?

20:38.739 --> 20:40.608
You're under arrest--I don't care!

20:40.652 --> 20:41.913
We just gotta
get out of here.

20:41.956 --> 20:43.391
What's the rush, Fred?Look, I'll tell you

20:43.434 --> 20:44.565
anything you
want to know.

20:44.608 --> 20:45.826
I'll tell you
about the next attack.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.217
Just get me the hell out of...

20:47.260 --> 20:49.565
[gunfire]

21:00.521 --> 21:01.739
If ever there
was a time

21:01.782 --> 21:04.043
for the dead to talk,
it would be now.

21:04.086 --> 21:06.347
I heard he said something
about an attack.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.478
Yes, but unfortunately,

21:08.521 --> 21:11.304
he was a tad short
on details.

21:11.347 --> 21:13.608
Yeah, speaking
of details, uh,

21:13.652 --> 21:17.826
has Abby mentioned anything
to you about my bachelor party?

21:17.869 --> 21:19.347
Mr. Palmer,
this is hardly the time.

21:19.391 --> 21:20.565
You're right.

21:20.608 --> 21:22.347
Of course. I-I'm sorry.
I just, uh...

21:22.391 --> 21:24.086
Besides, all I know
is that she asked

21:24.130 --> 21:27.565
to borrow the autopsy rotary saw
for tomorrow night.

21:29.391 --> 21:30.869
The one with the 15-foot cord?

21:30.913 --> 21:32.260
No, 20.

21:32.304 --> 21:34.304
She said 15 wouldn't
be long enough.

21:35.782 --> 21:37.217
Tell me you
got something, Duck.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.043
Yes, unfortunately, I do.

21:39.086 --> 21:42.521
Abby found some rather
disturbing physical evidence.

21:42.565 --> 21:45.347
Traces of an
explosive from a swab

21:45.391 --> 21:48.086
I took from under our
guest's fingernail.

21:48.130 --> 21:49.521
RDX?

21:49.565 --> 21:51.260
Yeah, that's disturbing.

21:51.304 --> 21:53.304
That's a very powerful
explosive.

21:53.347 --> 21:55.782
I shudder to think
of the damage it could do.

21:55.826 --> 21:57.478
He was going to tell us.

21:57.521 --> 21:59.086
Yes, I read
the report.

21:59.130 --> 22:00.826
Someone made sure he didn't.

22:00.869 --> 22:02.782
A very elusive someone.

22:02.826 --> 22:04.652
You find the bullet?
No.

22:04.695 --> 22:06.434
Killer used a frangible round.

22:06.478 --> 22:08.652
It shattered on impact.No brass, either.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.260
Nothing to trace,
which was the point.

22:10.304 --> 22:13.043
It reminds me of a
story of German spies

22:13.086 --> 22:15.695
behind enemy lines
in World War II.

22:15.739 --> 22:19.478
They traveled in pairs,
using the buddy system.

22:19.521 --> 22:20.956
In the event of capture,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.260
their orders
were to kill their buddy

22:23.304 --> 22:25.086
to prevent him from talking.

22:25.130 --> 22:27.347
Well, if that was the plan,
it worked.

22:27.391 --> 22:28.869
Oh, but the dead
do still speak.

22:28.913 --> 22:30.130
Mr. Palmer.

22:30.173 --> 22:35.565
I took that from
Mr. Fountain's forearm.

22:35.608 --> 22:37.304
Look familiar?

22:37.347 --> 22:39.434
Come on, Duck.
You can't be serious.

22:39.478 --> 22:40.826
Very.

22:40.869 --> 22:43.434
I'm pretty sure it's another
Watcher Fleet microchip.

22:43.478 --> 22:45.739
And judging by the
surrounding tissue,

22:45.782 --> 22:47.826
it was only
recently put in.

22:47.869 --> 22:49.043
Put in for what?

22:49.086 --> 22:50.391
Well, I imagine

22:50.434 --> 22:52.434
that would depend
on what's on it.

22:55.304 --> 22:57.478
No, we haven't I.D.'d a target.ZIVA:
All we know

22:57.521 --> 22:59.217
is RDX might be involved
in the attack.

22:59.260 --> 23:00.608
TONY: Yeah, I think
bomb-sniffing dogs

23:00.652 --> 23:02.043
would be
a good idea, too.

23:02.086 --> 23:03.652
Alarm bell has
been sounded.

23:03.695 --> 23:05.652
I sent everything we have
to Director Vance in Prague.

23:05.695 --> 23:07.869
It's a good time to be
at a NATO security conference.

23:07.913 --> 23:09.086
ZIVA:
Though there's not much

23:09.130 --> 23:10.304
anyone can do
without more information.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.913
McGee?

23:11.956 --> 23:14.173
Well, I've confirmed
that this is, in fact,

23:14.217 --> 23:15.739
a Watcher Fleet
microchip.

23:15.782 --> 23:17.521
It's actually the
exact same one

23:17.565 --> 23:19.434
we pulled out of
Agent Levin's arm.

23:19.478 --> 23:21.391
How'd Dearing get one?TONY: Well, he
must have bought it.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.869
We know Cole and Latham
were selling it

23:22.913 --> 23:23.869
to the highest bidder.

23:23.913 --> 23:25.391
That was almost a year ago.

23:25.434 --> 23:27.086
ZIVA: Among other things,
the chips revealed

23:27.130 --> 23:28.260
vulnerabilities
in our naval fleet.

23:28.304 --> 23:30.043
Now that we have one,
we may have

23:30.086 --> 23:31.565
a better idea
what Dearing is targeting.

23:31.608 --> 23:33.086
McGEE: Well, we would,
except all that

23:33.130 --> 23:34.695
information's
been erased.
What was on it?

23:34.739 --> 23:36.739
It's hard to tell.
It's in code.

23:36.782 --> 23:39.347
Encrypted?
No. More like
the second set of books

23:39.391 --> 23:42.130
that a front company might use
when doing something illegal.

23:42.173 --> 23:43.652
TONY: That's a lot
of dollar signs.

23:43.695 --> 23:45.478
McGEE: There's a huge
sum of money involved,

23:45.521 --> 23:47.434
all of it coming
from Dearing's company.

23:47.478 --> 23:49.304
There's also what
looks like purchases

23:49.347 --> 23:51.000
of specialized
machining equipment

23:51.043 --> 23:52.217
and raw materials.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.782
He's building something.

23:53.826 --> 23:55.304
I doubt it's a Cuisinart.

23:57.043 --> 23:58.304
What is that number?

23:58.347 --> 23:59.347
It appears repeatedly.

23:59.391 --> 24:00.434
McGEE: Yeah, I think
it has something

24:00.478 --> 24:02.217
to do with
the shipping manifest.

24:02.260 --> 24:03.434
I'm not
exactly sure.

24:03.478 --> 24:04.478
I'm not really
sure of any

24:04.521 --> 24:05.695
of it, to be
honest with you.

24:05.739 --> 24:07.434
Send it to Ryan.

24:07.478 --> 24:10.826
Tell her to bring a hard copy
to Maple's office.

24:13.043 --> 24:14.434
MAPLE:
It's unbelievable.

24:14.478 --> 24:15.608
This is just unbelievable.

24:15.652 --> 24:16.913
Huh?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.391
No, I wasn't talking to you.

24:18.434 --> 24:19.782
Uh, where'd you get all this?

24:19.826 --> 24:22.043
What's unbelievable?

24:22.086 --> 24:23.347
Well, these purchases
are all charged

24:23.391 --> 24:24.478
to our company accounts,

24:24.521 --> 24:26.434
but, uh, we have
no record of any of it.

24:26.478 --> 24:27.869
You're saying
that Dearing

24:27.913 --> 24:29.913
is stealing money
from his own company?

24:29.956 --> 24:31.869
And buying a lot
of equipment with it.

24:31.913 --> 24:34.347
These are all delivery codes
for deep-hole drillers,

24:34.391 --> 24:36.173
bottle borers,
CNC routers.

24:36.217 --> 24:37.347
You were right--
he's building something.

24:37.391 --> 24:38.782
A lot of something.

24:38.826 --> 24:40.521
Any idea what?

24:40.565 --> 24:42.478
Well, I can only think
of two things

24:42.521 --> 24:43.739
with this combination
of machinery.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.478
One, building a fuel

24:45.521 --> 24:47.304
preburner for the space shuttle.

24:47.347 --> 24:49.173
Think we can rule
that out.

24:49.217 --> 24:51.173
And two, making
artillery shells.

24:51.217 --> 24:52.434
Naval artillery shells.

24:53.478 --> 24:55.086
I think we can rule that in.

24:55.130 --> 24:56.434
But why on earth
would Mr. Dearing

24:56.478 --> 24:58.304
be building
naval artillery shells?

25:02.130 --> 25:03.956
What?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.478
No, uh-uh.

25:06.521 --> 25:08.739
No, no, what?No. No, no, no.

25:08.782 --> 25:11.043
No, no, no.
I am not talking

25:11.086 --> 25:13.869
unless you promise not to get
all insularly obsessive

25:13.913 --> 25:16.347
with negativistic
features on me.Are you talking to me?

25:16.391 --> 25:19.173
Look, you can't accuse me
of holding back.

25:19.217 --> 25:20.391
An idea popped in my head.

25:20.434 --> 25:22.347
I am sharing it
with you immediately.

25:22.391 --> 25:23.434
No, actually, you're not.

25:30.521 --> 25:32.260
One of the
vulnerabilities

25:32.304 --> 25:34.173
the Watcher Fleet
microchip exposed

25:34.217 --> 25:36.826
was a tolerance issue
in some of the larger

25:36.869 --> 25:39.695
naval gun barrels
that used RDX as a propellant.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.869
If the shells produced
weren't exactly to spec...

25:42.913 --> 25:44.434
Guns could explode.

25:44.478 --> 25:45.913
Yes, and then some.

25:45.956 --> 25:48.739
Now, you already found RDX
on one of Dearing's men.

25:48.782 --> 25:50.956
If he's building
his own defective shells

25:51.000 --> 25:52.739
and has a way to get them
into the supply chain...

25:52.782 --> 25:55.608
We could take out half our
own fleet during exercises.

25:55.652 --> 25:57.956
Yes.
Let me ask you
something.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.956
You were going to tell me
this if I didn't ask?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.521
What do you think?

26:02.565 --> 26:05.304
Whose side do you think
I'm on, really?

26:08.304 --> 26:10.173
[cell phone beeping]I'm calling Vance.

26:12.043 --> 26:14.913
[sighs]

26:14.956 --> 26:16.695
Exhibit A.

26:16.739 --> 26:20.130
A normal, perfectly constructed
artillery shell.

26:20.173 --> 26:21.304
Exhibit B.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.782
An RDX shell,

26:23.826 --> 26:25.478
which is slightly off spec,
but still within

26:25.521 --> 26:26.782
the supposedly acceptable

26:26.826 --> 26:27.956
tolerance limits.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Boom.
Ouch.

26:30.043 --> 26:32.347
This is all going to be blamed
on me and my bad teeth.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.347
I know Agent Gibbs is
just biding his time

26:34.391 --> 26:35.521
before he sends
me to Gitmo.

26:35.565 --> 26:36.869
No, he's not.

26:36.913 --> 26:38.347
He knows that you're
the victim in this.

26:38.391 --> 26:39.869
And in about
one minute,

26:39.913 --> 26:41.869
he'll know
that you're the hero.What?

26:41.913 --> 26:43.043
He's coming
down here now?

26:43.086 --> 26:44.608
But we haven't told
him what we found.

26:44.652 --> 26:46.391
But we don't have to.
He's that good.

26:46.434 --> 26:47.347
No, no.

26:47.391 --> 26:48.608
Ah-ah-ah.

26:48.652 --> 26:49.956
You're that good, too.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.347
This is your breakthrough.

26:51.391 --> 26:53.217
You should be the
one to tell him.

26:53.260 --> 26:55.521
Tell me what?

26:55.565 --> 26:57.565
Uh...

26:59.086 --> 27:03.347
Uh, when I was doing
some menial data entry

27:03.391 --> 27:05.608
on a report, I noticed
that the microchip

27:05.652 --> 27:08.695
Dr. Mallard removed from
Freddie Fountain's arm

27:08.739 --> 27:11.347
contained a private
decryption key.

27:13.391 --> 27:15.043
You don't know what that is.

27:15.086 --> 27:16.304
I don't care what that is.

27:16.347 --> 27:18.695
Right, of course.

27:18.739 --> 27:21.217
Well, think of it
as a regular key

27:21.260 --> 27:24.130
and the call from Dearing
to MTAC as a lock

27:24.173 --> 27:25.260
that we couldn't open.

27:25.304 --> 27:26.695
So...

27:26.739 --> 27:29.347
You used the microchip
to trace Dearing's call to MTAC.

27:29.391 --> 27:31.478
Exactly.
Why didn't you
just say so?

27:31.521 --> 27:33.391
In retrospect,
I wish I had.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.130
ABBY:
We got the number

27:35.173 --> 27:36.826
to the cell phone
that was used

27:36.869 --> 27:38.304
to initiate
Dearing's video call.

27:38.347 --> 27:39.304
It's unregistered.

27:39.347 --> 27:40.478
Unfortunately,
we'll have to wait

27:40.521 --> 27:41.826
for Dearing
to call again

27:41.869 --> 27:45.304
before...
we can get a location.

27:45.347 --> 27:47.434
I can't believe
I didn't think of that.

27:49.826 --> 27:52.260
DEARING:
Hello, Agent Gibbs.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.608
I'm impressed.

27:53.652 --> 27:56.043
This must mean you found
a microchip. Very good.

27:57.086 --> 27:58.956
I know about your son.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.521
Yeah?
What do you think you know?

28:00.565 --> 28:02.173
He was a sailor.

28:02.217 --> 28:03.869
Proud of his country.

28:03.913 --> 28:05.478
I wonder what
he would feel

28:05.521 --> 28:07.043
about what you're
doing now.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.086
What I'm doing needs to be done.

28:09.130 --> 28:11.913
A few must be sacrificed
for the cause.

28:11.956 --> 28:14.260
The greater good demands it.

28:14.304 --> 28:16.304
So, what good could
come out of this cause?

28:16.347 --> 28:17.782
You're paying attention, Agent.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.347
How's that for a start?

28:19.391 --> 28:21.652
You're all finally
paying attention.

28:21.695 --> 28:24.260
So, tell me
what you want.

28:24.304 --> 28:25.826
I want to hear about your cause.

28:25.869 --> 28:27.956
You've seen the effects.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.478
The cause will reveal itself
soon enough.

28:31.521 --> 28:33.391
Got it.

28:33.434 --> 28:37.260
54728 Donovan Street.

28:37.304 --> 28:39.260
54728?

28:39.304 --> 28:41.347
That's the same number
from the shipping manifest.

28:41.391 --> 28:42.565
It was an address.

28:42.608 --> 28:44.086
It's where the
equipment's being sent.

28:44.130 --> 28:46.304
We got Dearing's
bomb factory.

28:46.347 --> 28:48.782
Go get him, Gibbs!

28:48.826 --> 28:50.608
McGEE: Remember,
watch your fire.

28:50.652 --> 28:52.260
If they're building
munitions in there,

28:52.304 --> 28:53.739
we don't want
to set any off.

28:56.565 --> 28:58.565
ZIVA:
NCIS! Freeze!

28:58.608 --> 29:00.304
Nobody move.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.565
Well, this is anticlimactic.

29:05.608 --> 29:06.652
McGEE:
Where's all the equipment?

29:06.695 --> 29:07.739
It was supposed to be here.

29:07.782 --> 29:09.391
Well, it's not, McGee.

29:09.434 --> 29:11.304
Well, something must be here.

29:11.347 --> 29:13.217
[man humming]

29:13.260 --> 29:16.304
MAN:
♪ Your kisses smell so good

29:16.347 --> 29:18.739
♪ Yeah, when you kiss me

29:18.782 --> 29:20.260
[man humming]

29:20.304 --> 29:23.478
♪ Why don't you
kiss me? ♪

29:25.434 --> 29:26.478
NCIS.

29:26.521 --> 29:28.217
Can I help you?

29:28.260 --> 29:29.913
Do you know this man?

29:32.173 --> 29:33.434
DiNozzo.

29:33.478 --> 29:35.304
With pleasure, boss.

29:54.652 --> 29:58.086
Yakov Smirnoff is processed
and waiting in interrogation.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.565
GIBBS:
Let him wait.

29:59.608 --> 30:01.043
We definitely had
the right building, boss.

30:01.086 --> 30:02.217
The equipment
was sent there.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.347
Where is it?

30:03.391 --> 30:04.739
Maybe Dearing found out
we were coming

30:04.782 --> 30:06.130
and cleared it all out.

30:06.173 --> 30:07.565
No way.
Wasn't enough time.

30:07.608 --> 30:08.826
Maybe he's done
with it already.

30:08.869 --> 30:10.739
If he has already
finished building

30:10.782 --> 30:11.826
his defective
artillery shells...

30:11.869 --> 30:13.000
He could have
already slipped them

30:13.043 --> 30:14.043
into the supply chain.

30:16.173 --> 30:18.782
McGEE: That's a lot
of ships, boss.

30:18.826 --> 30:21.391
Ziva, update Naval Sea
Systems Command. McGee.

30:21.434 --> 30:23.000
I'll call Director Vance
and SECNAV,

30:23.043 --> 30:25.260
tell them they need to cancel
any naval exercises planned.

30:25.304 --> 30:26.695
DiNozzo.

30:26.739 --> 30:28.652
Yakov Smirnoff, aka...

30:28.695 --> 30:29.869
Ghenna Kozlov.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.347
Russian immigrant,
father of three.

30:31.391 --> 30:32.956
Pays his taxes,
no record.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.347
Apparently,

30:34.391 --> 30:35.913
he likes bingo.

30:35.956 --> 30:37.739
He's our best lead
to Dearing,

30:37.782 --> 30:39.695
but look at him.

30:39.739 --> 30:40.782
There's no there-there.

30:40.826 --> 30:42.304
DiNozzo, he was
found pushing a cart

30:42.347 --> 30:43.739
with a million
bucks on it.

30:43.782 --> 30:45.260
[chuckling]:
Yeah.

30:45.304 --> 30:46.956
Come on. There's
something there.

30:49.695 --> 30:50.956
You have to believe me.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.086
I had no idea
what's inside that case.

30:53.130 --> 30:55.304
[laughs]
Yeah, you said that.

30:55.347 --> 30:58.000
If I did, do you think
I will be working

30:58.043 --> 31:00.347
as a night watchman
for minimum wage?

31:00.391 --> 31:01.652
[laughs]

31:01.695 --> 31:03.565
I-I mean, I'm not saying

31:03.608 --> 31:04.956
I would have taken
the money, okay?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.521
Except you just did.

31:07.739 --> 31:09.652
How long you been working
at that warehouse?

31:10.695 --> 31:11.652
Uh, about a year.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.043
An agency hired me.

31:13.086 --> 31:14.260
Get any deliveries?

31:15.304 --> 31:16.695
Like this?

31:20.086 --> 31:21.217
No, never.

31:21.260 --> 31:24.478
My job is to keep eye
on the warehouse.

31:24.521 --> 31:26.913
Once a month,
truck deliver a small case.

31:26.956 --> 31:28.608
I have never
opened them.

31:28.652 --> 31:30.565
I had no idea
what's inside.

31:30.608 --> 31:31.826
I just hold it,
then wait.

31:31.869 --> 31:33.130
Another truck comes,

31:33.173 --> 31:34.304
picks it up, and that's it.

31:34.347 --> 31:36.521
Trucks, huh?
I didn't see any trucks.

31:36.565 --> 31:39.652
So, where were you
going with it?

31:39.695 --> 31:42.000
I received a text
on my work cell.

31:42.043 --> 31:45.521
It told me to deliver the case
to address on M Street tonight.

31:45.565 --> 31:47.391
To who?

31:47.434 --> 31:48.565
It didn't say.

31:48.608 --> 31:50.695
It just said a limousine
will be waiting.

31:54.478 --> 31:57.347
Get any other texts
like that, Ghenna?

31:57.391 --> 31:58.826
No, never.

32:00.869 --> 32:02.043
McGee.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.521
Night watchman's cell.

32:03.565 --> 32:04.695
Trace the last text.

32:04.739 --> 32:05.826
We got Dearing on the run.

32:05.869 --> 32:07.434
He's changing his routine,
trying to get

32:07.478 --> 32:08.565
his money out.
Well, he's been

32:08.608 --> 32:10.304
one step ahead of us
from the beginning,

32:10.347 --> 32:11.913
and he sure doesn't
need the money. McGee?

32:14.434 --> 32:15.521
The cell only received one text.

32:15.565 --> 32:16.739
Who?
It's not from
the number

32:16.782 --> 32:18.217
you called Dearing
at before.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.652
He disconnected that cell
as soon as he hung it up.

32:20.695 --> 32:22.173
I'm sure he's got
more than one.

32:22.217 --> 32:24.347
McGEE:
Looks like he does.

32:24.391 --> 32:25.739
This new cell is registered

32:25.782 --> 32:27.304
to a holding company
in his firm's name.

32:27.347 --> 32:29.217
[laughs] Gotcha.

32:29.260 --> 32:30.956
Night watchman
was supposed to meet a limo.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.695
Sounds like
gazillionaire wheels to me.

32:32.739 --> 32:34.521
ZIVA: Just got off the phone
with Director Vance.

32:34.565 --> 32:35.565
He's en route to DC.

32:35.608 --> 32:36.913
Should be landing
within the hour.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.130
He alert the fleet?

32:38.173 --> 32:40.347
Yes. Navy canceled
all planned war games.

32:40.391 --> 32:42.043
What's our
war game, boss?

32:42.086 --> 32:44.391
We are going to let the night
watchman deliver the money.

32:44.434 --> 32:45.565
A sting.

32:45.608 --> 32:47.173
I like it.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.000
But M Street's
going to be pretty bananas

32:49.043 --> 32:51.173
with all those coeds
running around, post finals.

32:51.217 --> 32:52.608
You guys are going

32:52.652 --> 32:54.000
to stick out like
a sore thumb.

32:54.043 --> 32:55.217
I usually fit
right in, but...

32:57.565 --> 32:59.782
We're going to have to cancel
Jimmy's bachelor party.

32:59.826 --> 33:01.043
JIMMY:
What?

33:01.086 --> 33:02.391
That's fine.
That's fine.

33:02.434 --> 33:03.913
No problem.
No problem at all.

33:03.956 --> 33:05.565
ABBY:
There you are.

33:05.608 --> 33:08.521
I have been looking
all over for you.

33:08.565 --> 33:10.608
Abby, did you hear?
The, uh... the party...

33:10.652 --> 33:12.521
the party's been canceled.
I... [sighs]

33:12.565 --> 33:13.913
Oh, well, right?

33:13.956 --> 33:16.695
What can we do?

33:16.739 --> 33:18.739
What?

33:18.782 --> 33:20.304
The party's canceled?

33:20.347 --> 33:21.869
No.

33:21.913 --> 33:23.695
GIBBS:
No.

33:23.739 --> 33:26.304
Actually, it's not.

33:28.130 --> 33:29.260
[laughter, music playing]

33:29.304 --> 33:30.565
McGEE:
With his finger!

33:30.608 --> 33:32.173
JIMMY:
He didn't do that!

33:32.217 --> 33:33.608
He did not do...

33:33.652 --> 33:35.695
No, no, no, I've had enough.
I've had enough.

33:35.739 --> 33:37.913
I've had enough.
I've had enough.Yes, you can't stop drinking it

33:37.956 --> 33:39.608
until he misses.Okay.

33:39.652 --> 33:41.130
[laughing]

33:41.173 --> 33:42.608
JIMMY:
Okay, okay.

33:42.652 --> 33:44.260
I'm watching.
I'm watching.

33:47.304 --> 33:50.086
Oh, come on, Leroy!

33:51.086 --> 33:52.521
Oh!

33:52.565 --> 33:53.652
Sniper!

33:55.565 --> 33:56.913
DORNEGET:
Oh, three in a row!
Nice.

33:56.956 --> 33:58.782
Wow.

33:58.826 --> 34:00.086
Give me a sitrep.DORNEGET:
It's really smooth.

34:00.130 --> 34:02.043
Our Russian is doing fine.

34:02.086 --> 34:03.086
The drop is set.

34:03.130 --> 34:04.782
GIBBS:
Copy that.

34:08.086 --> 34:09.739
It is quiet.

34:09.782 --> 34:10.782
No sign of the limo.

34:10.826 --> 34:11.956
Keep me posted.

34:13.347 --> 34:14.782
[slurring, stammering]

34:14.826 --> 34:16.739
In all seriousness,
in all seriousness,

34:16.782 --> 34:18.347
I'm going to talk because,

34:18.391 --> 34:20.391
let's be honest,
this is about me right now.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.565
[laughter]

34:24.347 --> 34:27.000
I'm really happy
that you guys are here tonight.

34:27.043 --> 34:28.826
As... as
Nathaniel Hawthorne

34:28.869 --> 34:30.695
once said of marriage,

34:30.739 --> 34:32.521
"Let man tremble

34:32.565 --> 34:34.695
at the hand of woman for..."

34:34.739 --> 34:37.086
Blah, blah, blah,
alcohol is fun.

34:37.130 --> 34:38.304
[laughter]

34:38.347 --> 34:39.826
I thought you said
this was apple juice.

34:39.869 --> 34:40.956
I even watered it down.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.391
JIMMY: You guys,
I want to sing.

34:42.434 --> 34:44.217
I want to sing.
Who wants to sing with me?

34:44.260 --> 34:45.217
Who wants...
I want to sing.

34:45.260 --> 34:47.260
McGEE:
Look sharp.

34:47.304 --> 34:48.652
Ziva.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.304
I see it.

34:51.695 --> 34:53.173
GIBBS [over radio]:
Okay, let's move.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.608
Now. Move.

34:54.652 --> 34:56.608
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:56.652 --> 34:57.739
Come on.
Here we go.

34:57.782 --> 34:59.043
This place is dead, anyway.

34:59.086 --> 35:01.260
It's dead.
We're going on a bar crawl!

35:01.304 --> 35:02.608
We're going on
a bar crawl!

35:02.652 --> 35:05.434
Oh, pop quiz--
who here is my best friend?

35:05.478 --> 35:07.478
I would say I have
a best friend, but I don't.

35:07.521 --> 35:08.695
Tonight, I have
four best friends.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.608
So, "Puff the
Magic Dragon,"

35:10.652 --> 35:12.434
barber shop
quartet style.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.608
Are you doing low,
or am I going low?

35:14.652 --> 35:16.695
[laughter]
GIBBS:
Move, move, move!

35:16.739 --> 35:18.652
Move, move, move!Oh, this is getting real.

35:18.695 --> 35:20.478
This is getting real.
This is real.

35:23.086 --> 35:24.608
NCIS! Hands in the air!

35:24.652 --> 35:26.391
TONY: Opening the
door, Dearing.

35:26.434 --> 35:27.434
No sudden moves.

35:31.826 --> 35:33.260
Boss, it's not Dearing.

35:33.304 --> 35:36.000
It's Vincent Maple.

35:36.043 --> 35:39.260
No bags, a fake I.D.
and a one-way ticket to Morocco.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.608
Perhaps because they do not have

35:40.652 --> 35:42.913
an extradition treaty
with the U.S.?

35:44.260 --> 35:45.782
I want to
make a deal.

35:45.826 --> 35:47.217
Yeah, I bet you do.

35:47.260 --> 35:49.347
We do not make deals
with terrorists.

35:49.391 --> 35:51.304
What?

35:53.695 --> 35:55.347
Where's Dearing?

35:55.391 --> 35:57.217
I don't know.

35:57.260 --> 35:58.782
How long have you
been working together?

35:58.826 --> 36:00.000
We're not.

36:00.043 --> 36:01.956
Look, I had nothing
to do with any of that.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.521
I told you I would help you
find Dearing, and I meant it.

36:04.565 --> 36:07.130
Okay? I really do have family
serving on Navy ships.

36:07.173 --> 36:09.000
What was all the equipment for?

36:09.043 --> 36:10.782
Not without a deal.

36:10.826 --> 36:14.043
Good luck at the
military tribunal, pal.

36:14.086 --> 36:15.652
[sighs]

36:15.695 --> 36:17.695
Wait.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.260
There was no equipment.

36:22.304 --> 36:24.869
Go on.

36:24.913 --> 36:27.478
And there was no secret,
off-the-books project.

36:27.521 --> 36:31.043
It was just a dummy account
that I had set up.

36:31.086 --> 36:32.826
Why?

36:32.869 --> 36:34.478
[sighs]

36:34.521 --> 36:37.043
To siphon money
out of Dearing's company.

36:37.086 --> 36:38.304
I had the cash
delivered

36:38.347 --> 36:40.130
to the warehouse
as accounts payable,

36:40.173 --> 36:42.043
and then laundered
to my overseas account.

36:42.086 --> 36:43.434
I was embezzling--
that's it.

36:43.478 --> 36:45.173
And Dearing wasn't involved?Not in the slightest.

36:45.217 --> 36:46.608
ZIVA:
You told us he was

36:46.652 --> 36:49.217
building faulty
artillery.
No, I did not.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.260
That was Dr. Ryan's theory,
not mine.

36:50.304 --> 36:51.347
I just let you run with it.

36:51.391 --> 36:53.260
You were sitting there
holding a copy

36:53.304 --> 36:54.782
of my entire
embezzling blueprint.

36:54.826 --> 36:55.869
What choice did I have?

36:55.913 --> 36:57.565
The choice not to
be a criminal.

36:57.608 --> 36:59.000
[sighs]

37:01.391 --> 37:04.173
The real question you guys
should be asking is:

37:04.217 --> 37:06.434
How'd you get
a copy of my books?

37:09.086 --> 37:11.347
We got the cooked books
from the microchip

37:11.391 --> 37:12.478
inside Dearing's henchman.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.739
Freddie Fountain.

37:13.782 --> 37:15.347
On a hunch,
we went back to the BOLO

37:15.391 --> 37:16.260
that I.D.'d his car.

37:16.304 --> 37:17.391
Found something
interesting.

37:17.434 --> 37:18.608
It was an
anonymous tip.

37:18.652 --> 37:19.826
TONY:
Good guess, boss.

37:19.869 --> 37:21.826
Someone wanted us
to find Fountain.

37:21.869 --> 37:23.956
Abby's tracing the call now.ABBY:
Traced it.

37:25.652 --> 37:28.043
Our tipster was none other
than Harper Dearing.

37:28.086 --> 37:30.130
It's the same cell that
led us to the warehouse.

37:30.173 --> 37:32.347
Dearing ratted out
his own man?

37:32.391 --> 37:34.391
He wanted us to find
the cooked books.

37:34.434 --> 37:35.695
He wanted us
to find the warehouse.

37:35.739 --> 37:36.869
Okay, that's not
my department,

37:36.913 --> 37:38.347
but if any of you
see Jimmy,

37:38.391 --> 37:40.304
can you tell him that your
little op doesn't count?

37:40.347 --> 37:41.260
We still have plans,

37:41.304 --> 37:43.217
even if it's just
the two of us.

37:46.304 --> 37:48.130
Dearing must have
found out

37:48.173 --> 37:49.956
that Maple
was embezzling from him

37:50.000 --> 37:52.391
and used it to send us
on a wild-goose chase.

37:52.434 --> 37:54.173
He was just trying
to distract us.

37:54.217 --> 37:56.217
Distract us from what?

37:57.434 --> 37:59.173
Mm-hmm. Yes, Admiral.

37:59.217 --> 38:03.217
My... my team is working
directly with NCIS.

38:03.260 --> 38:05.260
[chuckling]:
Y-Yes.

38:05.304 --> 38:07.260
Agent Gibbs is, uh...

38:07.304 --> 38:08.652
quite interesting.

38:10.826 --> 38:13.347
Oh, I have a couple stories
of my own.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.347
Uh-huh.

38:14.391 --> 38:16.043
Bye-bye.

38:16.086 --> 38:18.086
Admiral Davis, an old friend.

38:19.608 --> 38:22.086
So, heard
about Maple.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.086
I thought we were so close.

38:25.652 --> 38:29.652
Want to go grab a beer
and... and go over it?

38:29.695 --> 38:31.347
No.
Oh.

38:31.391 --> 38:34.347
I can see those Gibbsian wheels
a-turnin' even from here.

38:34.391 --> 38:35.826
What's up?

38:37.260 --> 38:39.869
The defective
artillery theory.

38:41.478 --> 38:43.043
That one was yours.

38:43.086 --> 38:45.000
Yeah, yeah, it was.

38:45.043 --> 38:47.043
I was wrong-- again.

38:47.086 --> 38:48.347
[sighs]

38:48.391 --> 38:49.782
Thanks for reminding me.

38:52.086 --> 38:55.086
This is the point
where you usually say,

38:55.130 --> 38:56.608
you know, "We're all human.

38:56.652 --> 38:58.173
Everyone makes mistakes."

38:59.217 --> 39:01.086
That what it was, Doc?
A mistake?

39:01.130 --> 39:03.130
[laughing]

39:03.173 --> 39:08.130
Oh, what exactly are you
accusing me of, Agent Gibbs?

39:09.826 --> 39:11.173
I don't know.

39:14.304 --> 39:16.739
Have you lost your mind?

39:16.782 --> 39:18.043
I don't know.

39:18.086 --> 39:19.782
Why do you keep
saying that?

39:19.826 --> 39:21.478
Because I don't know!

39:21.521 --> 39:23.521
With everybody else,
Doc, I know,

39:23.565 --> 39:25.521
but with you...

39:25.565 --> 39:27.304
God, I'm trying here!

39:27.347 --> 39:29.695
Oh, and for an
introverted,

39:29.739 --> 39:30.956
intuitive feeler
like you,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.956
this must be intolerable.Why do you always

39:33.000 --> 39:34.217
have to talk like this?Like what?

39:34.260 --> 39:36.695
Why can't you just be
like a regular person?

39:36.739 --> 39:38.130
Like a person?Like a normal person.

39:38.173 --> 39:39.391
Like a human.

39:40.782 --> 39:43.913
This from the man
who doesn't talk.

39:46.826 --> 39:49.304
[cell phone buzzing]

39:49.347 --> 39:50.434
[phone beeps]

39:52.652 --> 39:54.782
What is it?

39:57.434 --> 39:59.478
It's got to be
from Dearing.

39:59.521 --> 40:02.391
He wrote his
college thesis on chess.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.391
Something must
have happened.

40:04.434 --> 40:05.695
[line ringing]

40:05.739 --> 40:07.739
Boss.DiNozzo, what's
going on?

40:07.782 --> 40:09.913
I was just about to
call you. So you heard?

40:09.956 --> 40:10.913
I heard what?

40:10.956 --> 40:12.043
ZIVA:
Just got off the phone

40:12.086 --> 40:13.043
with Director Vance's
security detail.

40:13.086 --> 40:14.304
He insisted
on driving home

40:14.347 --> 40:16.304
by himself,
but he never made it.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.434
He's disappeared, boss.

40:17.478 --> 40:19.913
ZIVA:
They have no idea where he is.
