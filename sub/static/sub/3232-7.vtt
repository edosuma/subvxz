00:16.079 --> 00:19.311
The city's called Duke
The state's called New Mexico

00:25.440 --> 00:29.274
Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated

00:30.040 --> 00:34.352
'Cause of the new drug they created

00:42.400 --> 00:47.918
They say the colour is blue
And the quality pure

00:53.840 --> 00:57.674
This potent drug's runnin'
Through the city

00:58.480 --> 01:02.792
And no one could stop it
If they wanted to

01:05.239 --> 01:11.110
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

01:12.000 --> 01:17.836
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

01:20.360 --> 01:24.319
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

01:25.000 --> 01:28.390
The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving

01:29.520 --> 01:35.834
But that homey's dead
He just doesn't know it yet

01:50.840 --> 01:57.154
Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan

01:59.680 --> 02:03.593
From way far away
They want to taste that meth

02:04.280 --> 02:09.195
That blue stuff has crossed the border

02:16.600 --> 02:18.431
Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name

02:27.200 --> 02:31.432
Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding

02:31.880 --> 02:37.557
Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg"

02:40.160 --> 02:45.359
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

02:47.400 --> 02:51.996
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

02:55.360 --> 02:59.319
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

02:59.880 --> 03:03.509
The fury of the cartel
Ain't no one escaped it yet

03:04.000 --> 03:07.754
But that homey's dead

03:07.960 --> 03:11.111
He just doesn't know it yet

03:35.400 --> 03:40.428
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn....

03:42.120 --> 03:44.236
You do know what a bond is?

03:47.200 --> 03:50.397
A strong force of attraction.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.637
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

03:53.840 --> 03:58.038
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.639
No?

04:00.480 --> 04:05.600
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.713
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.993
-What hold us together.
-Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.155
Bonds.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.793
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.032
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.316
What is "close"?

04:31.520 --> 04:33.397
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.398
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.750
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.829
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.833
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.433
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.313
Like, all night, hard.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.638
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

04:59.840 --> 05:05.437
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit....

05:05.640 --> 05:07.915
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

05:17.320 --> 05:19.629
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.992
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.679
Yo. Ifl know you, leave a message.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.271
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

06:15.480 --> 06:20.600
Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.510
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the....

06:25.720 --> 06:28.280
When I said, "Handle it."

06:28.480 --> 06:32.439
Well, don't. Just let it go.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.073
All right.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.188
Come on.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.278
Jesse, open the door.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.029
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.879
Can I help you?

07:10.240 --> 07:11.434
No. Thank you.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.756
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.199
You're the manager?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.755
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.630
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key....

07:25.840 --> 07:29.355
-You have a key, right?
-Yeah, I have a key.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.633
Look, the person who lives here...

07:34.840 --> 07:37.638
...it's just very important
for me to see him.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.593
-And you knocked, right?
-Yeah.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.711
He didn't answer?

07:43.520 --> 07:45.158
Which means...?

07:48.640 --> 07:52.519
-Look, I'm his father, all right?
-You're Mr. Jackson?

07:53.920 --> 07:57.071
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.235
And you are...?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.669
-Jane.
-Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.757
Now, if you wouldn't mind....

08:03.960 --> 08:06.679
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.713
-Wanna call him?
-No.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.472
No. I--

08:12.680 --> 08:15.990
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here...

08:16.200 --> 08:19.510
...so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.233
You understand?

08:21.440 --> 08:24.432
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.358
I don't get involved in family.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.755
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.915
Period.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.758
Sorry.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.677
Come on in, Dad.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.830
-Thanks.
-You okay?

08:47.240 --> 08:48.719
Yeah.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.156
"Jesse Jackson"?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.032
Do you even...?

09:00.880 --> 09:03.838
Oh, I see you have a telephone,
at least.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.237
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

09:07.440 --> 09:09.476
Whatever, man.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.873
-Hey, give me my-- Give--
-I will break this. I will break this!

09:16.080 --> 09:18.469
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing...

09:18.680 --> 09:20.750
...the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

09:20.960 --> 09:24.589
-No. I've been taking care of business.
-What business?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.234
What business?

09:26.440 --> 09:30.911
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

09:37.280 --> 09:39.316
This business.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.393
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.278
-You didn't actually--?
-Hey, you said--

09:52.480 --> 09:54.630
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.673
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.757
I meant get your money back.
I never meant--

09:59.960 --> 10:01.951
-Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
-No!

10:02.160 --> 10:04.993
Well, too late, yo,
because dude's dead.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.997
-Oh, God.
-All right? Way dead.

10:07.200 --> 10:11.159
-Oh, God.
-Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.191
Here's your money.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.950
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

10:19.680 --> 10:24.435
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.837
I didn't say I killed him.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.519
Tell me what happened.

11:00.280 --> 11:04.114
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.470
-Crushed his--?
-Crushed his head...

11:07.680 --> 11:10.592
...with an ATM machine
right in front of me.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.756
I mean, crushed it like....

11:13.680 --> 11:17.229
Oh, my God, the sound...

11:17.440 --> 11:19.112
...it's still in my ears.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.914
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

11:22.120 --> 11:27.148
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

11:27.360 --> 11:32.115
Man, will you just please give me--?
Just give me my weed, all right?

11:32.320 --> 11:34.675
It helps with my nausea.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.113
So...

11:38.760 --> 11:41.228
...you did not kill anyone?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.913
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.872
I called the cops.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.230
You called the cops?

11:49.440 --> 11:52.796
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.991
And then they came in
and busted her.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.468
God, she was--
She was so zapped out of her mind.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.911
You know? It's....
She did it for, like, nothing.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.476
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

12:06.680 --> 12:11.800
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

12:12.920 --> 12:16.515
She couldn't identify
her left ass cheek.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.915
She was so zonked.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.350
And she had this....

12:23.120 --> 12:24.553
God, she had this kid.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.033
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here...

12:28.240 --> 12:32.995
...but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.839
Look, she had a gun on me,
all right?

12:43.240 --> 12:45.834
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.792
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.834
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

12:52.040 --> 12:55.589
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.716
Yo. Ifl know you, leave a message.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.798
-Hey, it's Badger, man.
-What are you doing?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.629
-Don't use your real name.
-What? That isn't my real name.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.789
Okay.

13:14.400 --> 13:19.110
Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
Thirty-two large, right?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.709
We got them just for you, jefe.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.275
Let's do some business, yo.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.359
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

13:36.920 --> 13:38.512
No.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.518
You get on. All right?

13:41.720 --> 13:44.553
I just want to forget. I just....

13:53.680 --> 13:54.954
Sorry.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.469
Hey.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.796
Hey, what's up with that?

14:11.560 --> 14:15.314
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.034
Well, yeah, hell,
I know who it is, okay?

14:18.240 --> 14:20.708
Scumbags kneeling down
praying to him:

14:20.920 --> 14:25.869
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

14:33.760 --> 14:36.638
I'm just-- I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

14:37.560 --> 14:40.393
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

14:43.120 --> 14:45.793
-Sun Tzu.
-Son who?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.673
Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote The Art of War.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.477
"lf you know your enemy
as yourself...

14:51.680 --> 14:54.114
...you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

14:57.760 --> 14:59.318
Right on.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.152
-Agent Schrader.
-Sir.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.358
-Glad to have you onboard.
-Thanks.

15:11.560 --> 15:15.269
-Everybody getting you settled in?
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.677
And gals. And gals.
Guys-- Guys and gals.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.474
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.240
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

15:24.440 --> 15:25.998
Yes, sir.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.470
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.272
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.950
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.992
-Hey, watch it.
-lt ain't real, dumb-ass.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.269
Just watch it, is all.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.198
You watch it.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.558
I'm Heisenberg.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.112
You're Heisenberg?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.276
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.673
Let's get this over with.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.438
Where's Jesse?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.628
-Busy.
-Hey, that's cool.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.193
Real cool.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.879
Totally cool.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.479
Hey, hey--

16:42.680 --> 16:47.037
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.277
-Here?
-I'm just saying....

16:50.480 --> 16:52.232
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.476
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations...

16:54.680 --> 16:55.908
...as to who we work for.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.192
And that's church, yo. For real.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.678
What have you heard?

17:07.800 --> 17:10.394
Did Jesse really...?

17:11.319 --> 17:13.914
I mean, did he really...

17:16.280 --> 17:18.748
...squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

17:18.960 --> 17:20.233
Word.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.473
Who's saying that?

17:26.680 --> 17:30.559
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

17:30.760 --> 17:33.320
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money...

17:33.520 --> 17:35.192
...but today everybody's paying up.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.198
True that. Serious.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.197
But, like....

17:41.440 --> 17:42.953
He really did it?

17:52.440 --> 17:54.749
You didn't hear that from me.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.474
Big lunch.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.439
Thank you.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.190
-Here you go.
-Very good, Ms. White.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.994
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.428
Thank you.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.552
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.829
Really?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.837
When are you due?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.833
-Several months.
-Congratulations.

18:59.160 --> 19:03.597
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.155
Family.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.196
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.471
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I-- I think he'll remember me.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.353
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.755
You know, if it's okay, I'll just--

19:25.800 --> 19:27.279
Ma'am--

19:40.320 --> 19:43.392
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.033
Hey, Ted.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.435
-Come in, come in.
-Okay.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.154
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.793
Come on, sit down right here.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.150
Okay. Thank you.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.716
-You look great.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.076
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.510
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.359
I'll bet. One of each.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.719
How's Walt Jr.?

20:10.920 --> 20:14.390
Oh, 10th grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.079
He's-- He's taller than I am now.

20:16.920 --> 20:21.869
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.514
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.235
Good genes.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.793
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.070
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.316
-They're gorgeous.
-Yes, they are.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.035
And they know it.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.958
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.752
Yeah.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.918
So the big office, huh?

20:49.120 --> 20:50.758
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.837
Weird, isn't it?

20:53.040 --> 20:55.270
I still think of it as my dad's.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.754
I miss him.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.439
Me too.

20:59.280 --> 21:04.229
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.477
Yeah, he'd be proud.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.039
Walt? How's he doing?

21:10.240 --> 21:14.995
Oh, he's-- He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.476
-Great. He's still teaching?
-Yeah.

21:18.680 --> 21:23.276
-You tell him I said hello.
-I will definitely do that.

21:27.200 --> 21:32.035
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I....

21:33.400 --> 21:36.358
I was applying for the data-entry job.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.279
You're kidding.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.675
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.235
Yeah. Well...

21:44.440 --> 21:46.795
...the economy, you know, so....

21:47.000 --> 21:50.390
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mistake.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.878
How about...

21:57.400 --> 21:58.753
...get your old job back?

22:00.920 --> 22:04.549
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me...

22:04.760 --> 22:06.955
...the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.749
Your work would be cut out for you...

22:10.680 --> 22:12.557
...but we could use your help.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.753
Okay.

22:21.920 --> 22:25.515
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.948
Hey. Hello.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.390
-Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
-Now, look at this.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.431
Here, here, here and here.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.597
What does that look like to you?

22:35.920 --> 22:39.037
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.679
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.552
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

22:44.760 --> 22:48.070
-Because it's not our territory?
-Because we lack initiative.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.508
-lnitiative.
-Yes.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.597
You need to employ more dealers.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.030
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

22:54.240 --> 22:58.313
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.476
Exponential growth,
that's the key here.

23:00.680 --> 23:06.198
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

23:06.400 --> 23:08.960
We go rolling into
these neighbourhoods...

23:09.160 --> 23:11.879
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

23:12.280 --> 23:14.635
Sure, they won't like it...

23:14.840 --> 23:17.593
...but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.677
-No. Listen, Jesse--
-No.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.438
Jesse.

23:22.600 --> 23:28.357
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.197
-What are you talking about?
-Apparently, it's all over town.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.789
Somebody crossed you,
you got angry...

23:35.000 --> 23:37.958
...you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.071
-That's not how it happened.
-Who cares...

23:40.280 --> 23:43.431
...as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

23:43.640 --> 23:46.791
-Oh, my--
-No, don't you see how great this is?

23:48.440 --> 23:50.908
Look, you-- You are a....

23:54.040 --> 23:55.712
Jesse, look at me.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.352
You are a blowfish.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.676
-What?
-A blowfish. Think about it.

24:01.880 --> 24:05.839
Small in stature,
not swift, not cunning.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.268
Easy prey for predators...

24:07.480 --> 24:09.675
...but the blowfish
has a secret weapon...

24:09.880 --> 24:12.110
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?

24:12.320 --> 24:16.074
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

24:18.760 --> 24:20.716
-I don't even know--
-The blowfish puffs up.

24:20.920 --> 24:24.595
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.268
And why? Why does he do that?

24:27.480 --> 24:30.040
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.195
Intimidating.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.472
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.319
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.353
You see, it's just all an illusion.

24:40.560 --> 24:43.438
You see, it's nothing but air.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.319
Now...

24:46.640 --> 24:49.518
...who messes with the blowfish,
Jesse?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.994
-Nobody.
-You're damn right.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.078
-I'm a blowfish.
-You are a blowfish.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.713
-Say it again.
-I'm a blowfish.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.717
-Say it like you mean it.
-I'm a blowfish.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.673
-You're a blowfish. That's right.
-Yeah!

25:03.880 --> 25:06.633
Blowfishing this up.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.068
Hello?

25:44.280 --> 25:47.078
The SkyMall.
Give me the SkyMall, would you?

25:52.600 --> 25:53.953
Vanco...

25:54.160 --> 25:57.550
...new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

25:58.600 --> 26:02.229
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

26:02.440 --> 26:05.591
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

26:06.200 --> 26:09.158
You know what? I'll teach you.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.917
It means, "Let's make a deal."

26:16.120 --> 26:18.315
So go ahead. We're waiting.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.473
Okay.

26:23.560 --> 26:24.879
Right here.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.674
"ltem SS4G:

26:27.880 --> 26:32.237
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball...

26:32.440 --> 26:34.158
...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

26:34.360 --> 26:36.828
Vanco, write this down.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.312
Oh, man, watch out.

26:39.800 --> 26:44.555
"66100ZBG: large-size floor runner."

26:44.760 --> 26:47.832
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor...

26:48.040 --> 26:50.793
...except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.073
I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my casa.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.395
We'll get you three.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.556
-No, you give me 10.
-Five.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.711
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

27:07.800 --> 27:10.758
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

27:12.400 --> 27:14.311
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

27:14.520 --> 27:17.193
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.389
Schrader....

27:18.600 --> 27:24.789
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

27:25.000 --> 27:29.278
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

27:29.480 --> 27:33.871
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

27:36.800 --> 27:40.713
I take my time, but I always win.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.758
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.349
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.312
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.478
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

27:55.680 --> 27:57.272
Definitely two of those, huh?

27:57.880 --> 28:00.872
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.589
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.234
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

28:07.440 --> 28:10.398
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.955
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.673
They keep him busy every second.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.791
He's already got some
big operation going.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.275
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about...

28:19.480 --> 28:21.710
...except it's on the other side
of the border.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.433
Wow, that sounds exciting.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.071
He's being safe, right?

28:26.280 --> 28:28.271
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.358
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.799
Speaking of riding desks...

28:35.280 --> 28:36.872
...got myself a job today.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.595
You did not.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.674
As big as you are?

28:46.200 --> 28:50.159
-Thank you.
-You know I just mean....

28:50.360 --> 28:51.918
Where? With who?

28:52.120 --> 28:55.669
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.835
Beneke.

28:57.040 --> 29:00.555
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

29:00.760 --> 29:02.796
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.755
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

29:07.960 --> 29:11.157
-Just what you want in an executive.
-And he apologised profusely.

29:11.360 --> 29:14.796
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.594
It will not happen again.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.955
Is money that tight?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.313
Yeah.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.398
You know we can always help out.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.957
No, Marie.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.759
You know Walt. He would just....

29:38.040 --> 29:40.315
-Speak of the devil.
-Hey. Hi, Marie.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.158
How are you? What's up?

29:43.320 --> 29:44.992
Nothing much.
How's things with you?

29:45.480 --> 29:46.799
-Good. Good.
-Hi, honey.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.514
-Dinner will be about an hour and--
-Oh, thanks, sweetie.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.235
-Everything okay?
-Everything's perfect.

30:14.240 --> 30:18.153
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.271
So? Same thing.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.959
Not the same thing.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.833
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

30:25.280 --> 30:29.114
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

30:29.320 --> 30:34.189
It's-- It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.549
You're pushing it.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.399
-Morning.
-Morning, honey.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.556
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.718
Dad, notice anything?

30:45.680 --> 30:47.238
Is there a funeral today?

30:47.440 --> 30:48.395
-A funeral?
-Well--

30:48.600 --> 30:50.636
-Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
-No, no, no.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.831
Mom got a job.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.393
A job? Why?

30:54.600 --> 30:57.034
Well, do I need to get out
the chequebook and show you?

30:57.240 --> 31:00.232
No, l.... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

31:00.440 --> 31:03.034
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labour.

31:03.240 --> 31:06.471
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.229
Where?

31:10.200 --> 31:11.553
Beneke.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.228
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.955
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit...

31:18.160 --> 31:21.038
-...in the first place?
-They've gone green since then.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.755
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.599
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.517
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

31:31.720 --> 31:32.789
Yeah.

31:33.000 --> 31:33.989
Who's running things?

31:34.200 --> 31:36.350
Ted. The son.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.670
Anyway, I have got to go.

31:41.880 --> 31:45.316
I don't wanna be late
my first day back.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.192
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.118
-Bye.
-Bye.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.673
Okay.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.120
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.315
Bye.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.153
Hey.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.591
You left your cave.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.718
Yeah.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.434
I was-- I'm missing my TV.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.959
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.594
You know,
snag a big-ass wide-screen.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.959
So....

32:26.360 --> 32:27.793
Yeah.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.032
What you drawing?

32:32.840 --> 32:33.795
Damn.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.319
That's good.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.112
Make a hell of a tat.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.389
That's the plan.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.715
Really?

32:39.920 --> 32:42.639
I work part-time, down at ABQ lnk.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.875
Right on.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.395
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.076
I used to do a little of that.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.473
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

32:58.320 --> 32:59.912
What stopped you?

33:03.200 --> 33:05.031
You know, just....

33:05.240 --> 33:07.071
So tell me something.

33:07.280 --> 33:11.478
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.430
That's way too big a commitment.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.351
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.750
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.359
Yeah.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.830
Right on, man. Keep it real.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.115
"Pinkman," huh?

33:44.320 --> 33:45.673
Yeah.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.030
I thought your name was "Jackson."

34:03.120 --> 34:05.680
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.069
Are we...?

34:07.280 --> 34:08.713
Are we just on mañana time?

34:08.920 --> 34:10.194
They'll show.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.039
Yeah? Why is that?

34:13.280 --> 34:16.033
You got more catalogues
for him to clean out?

34:16.719 --> 34:19.757
Maybe a little Sharper lmage
or Pottery Barn?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.431
What the hell are they thinking?

34:25.639 --> 34:28.029
Sending us some loudmouth
who doesn't speak the language?

34:28.280 --> 34:30.350
Politics, man. Politics.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.036
Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
I say it's a bunch of crap.

34:37.600 --> 34:42.310
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
Maybe it don't take much up there.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.116
Hey, something
I need to know about?

34:46.320 --> 34:48.594
What? Oh, that? No, man.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.632
We were just singing your praises.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.068
Glad to have you.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.952
Welcome aboard.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.158
Hey, is that your guy?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.835
Hey, I think that's your guy.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.111
What the hell
is he doing down there?

36:27.400 --> 36:28.958
Schrader, where you going?

36:30.080 --> 36:33.675
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.670
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw...

36:37.880 --> 36:40.075
...a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.514
Hey, welcome to--

37:18.120 --> 37:19.553
My leg.

37:38.480 --> 37:42.359
--headed by Werner Heisenberg,
were also undertaken during the war.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.869
The game has changed, yo.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.755
This is our city, all right?

37:47.960 --> 37:50.394
All of it. The whole damn place.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.556
Our territory.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.478
We're staking our claim...

37:54.680 --> 37:58.275
...that we sell when we want,
where we want.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.119
Now, we're gonna be kings,
understand?

38:01.320 --> 38:02.799
Well, I'm gonna be king.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.355
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.074
-I wanna be a knight.
-But first things first.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.272
We gotta get more dealers.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.869
You know, foot soldiers, right?

38:13.080 --> 38:14.798
Now, they'll be working for you.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.958
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.152
You follow me?

38:20.360 --> 38:22.078
Layered, like nachos.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.918
Exponential growth.

38:24.120 --> 38:27.556
Now, that's success
with a capital S.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.239
Straight up, straight up.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.395
For shizzle.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.589
Frigging awesome.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.592
Well, we're set.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.156
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.354
Cheddar, Mr. White.

38:50.560 --> 38:54.599
Fat stacks, dead presidents,
cash money.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.752
Gonna own this city.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.919
We're not charging enough.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.435
What?

39:03.200 --> 39:05.634
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.350
Simple economics.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.315
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.318
-Looks like they got you all set up.
-Yeah. It's perfect.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.398
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

39:36.600 --> 39:37.555
And that's very nice.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.910
-I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
-Yeah.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.709
Listen, l....

39:44.040 --> 39:46.759
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.675
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

39:52.880 --> 39:56.714
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

39:57.080 --> 39:58.479
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.875
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.479
Hey, how is Denise doing?

40:03.640 --> 40:05.358
We split up, about a year ago.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.713
I'm sorry.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.120
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.788
-Together since high school.
-Yeah.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.877
-I remember that.
-Anyway....

40:17.960 --> 40:19.837
I don't know, people change.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.075
Yes.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.748
Anyway, I just wanted
to welcome you.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.349
Welcome you back. And....

40:26.560 --> 40:28.949
I'll see you around
the vending machines.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.599
Okay.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.473
We should have lunch one day.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.874
Like old times.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.119
Sure.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.672
Oh, hey.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.118
Hey, yourself.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.797
So listen. My....

42:19.320 --> 42:21.914
My name is not really
Jesse Jackson.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.556
It's Jesse Pinkman.

42:26.760 --> 42:29.513
And that guy you met...

42:29.840 --> 42:34.231
...he's not my dad.

42:42.600 --> 42:46.434
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?

42:46.640 --> 42:49.359
Because I actually really like it here.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.475
I don't make it my business
what you do.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.475
So long as you don't do it here.

43:02.800 --> 43:06.588
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.872
Wanna see?

43:38.040 --> 43:40.395
It's got that thing where the blacks...

43:40.600 --> 43:44.559
...are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

43:45.240 --> 43:49.870
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

43:50.080 --> 43:54.039
So it'll really rock the house.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.598
But I'll, you know....

43:56.800 --> 44:01.828
I'll keep it way down, of course.

44:11.480 --> 44:14.472
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

44:17.560 --> 44:20.393
Come on, come on.
