WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:02.402
GAMBLE:
Previously on The Practice.

00:02.435 --> 00:03.870
I could actually
go away for life

00:03.904 --> 00:05.705
simply because I happened
to look like somebody?

00:05.739 --> 00:08.074
BERLUTI: Like somebody
who stabbed three women.

00:08.108 --> 00:09.710
Could you tell us
what you found?

00:09.743 --> 00:11.745
Jumper cables, tool kit.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.880
We think that was his M.O.
for approaching women,

00:13.914 --> 00:16.449
disabling their cars
and then coming to their rescue.

00:16.482 --> 00:17.884
Get him to flash his rage.

00:17.918 --> 00:18.819
Why?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.120
Because you're the prototype

00:20.153 --> 00:21.454
of the women he kills.

00:21.487 --> 00:23.957
GAMBLE: A talented,
good-looking man

00:23.990 --> 00:25.626
who still lives with his mother.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.760
RUSSELL:
We're very compatible.

00:26.793 --> 00:27.961
Ever had sex with her?

00:27.994 --> 00:28.962
Objection!
Objection!

00:32.131 --> 00:34.167
WALSH: "Those who falsely
accuse others

00:34.200 --> 00:36.436
deserve punishment themselves."

00:36.469 --> 00:38.404
YOUNG: This is
a thinly veiled threat

00:38.438 --> 00:40.273
on a D. A.'s life, Russell.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.875
Look, I don't know
what's going on.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.810
Maybe the real killer's
playing head games,

00:43.844 --> 00:45.011
but I didn't send that.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.248
FOREMAN: We find the defendant,
Russell Bakey, not guilty.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.716
(sighs)

00:49.750 --> 00:52.252
One might think this verdict
takes you out of danger.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.788
Let's hope.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.791
Lindsay?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.292
Mr. Deeks?

00:59.325 --> 01:00.601
DEEKS: I have a situation.

01:01.001 --> 01:02.368
What's the situation?

01:02.402 --> 01:04.304
I had a relapse.

01:06.873 --> 01:08.675
WYATT: Oh, my God.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.711
DOLE: A client of mine
has admitted to me

01:10.744 --> 01:13.013
that he took Cindy's life.

01:13.046 --> 01:16.950
Privilege prevents me
from telling you anything more.

01:16.983 --> 01:19.620
I am so sorry.

01:19.653 --> 01:20.721
MANTLE: I won't
make them reveal

01:20.754 --> 01:22.723
the identity of their client,

01:22.756 --> 01:24.190
but I am ordering them

01:24.224 --> 01:25.692
to tell us where the body is.

01:25.726 --> 01:27.561
This is privileged information,

01:27.594 --> 01:29.262
and I won't reveal it.

01:29.295 --> 01:30.130
(door closes)

01:30.163 --> 01:32.232
How long will they keep us?

01:32.265 --> 01:35.101
Until we tell
(sighs)

01:35.135 --> 01:37.437
or until it becomes
clear we won't.

01:39.205 --> 01:40.173
DONNELL: Eugene thinks,

01:40.206 --> 01:41.908
and I agree,
that I should argue.

01:41.942 --> 01:44.678
This judge obviously
doesn't respond to reason.

01:44.711 --> 01:46.980
Perhaps the emotion
of a husband

01:47.013 --> 01:48.348
pleading
to free his wife--

01:48.381 --> 01:50.083
WYATT: Well,
who's gonna argue for me?

01:50.116 --> 01:51.585
I don't even have a boyfriend.

01:51.618 --> 01:52.919
I'll argue for both of you.

01:52.953 --> 01:55.155
How long can they hold us,
really?

01:55.188 --> 01:56.623
DONNELL: Well,
once a contempt order

01:56.657 --> 01:59.425
proves to be futile,
it's usually lifted,

01:59.459 --> 02:01.134
but with this judge...

02:09.375 --> 02:11.912
RUSSELL: Helen. Hi.

02:11.945 --> 02:13.580
Fancy meeting you here.

02:14.014 --> 02:15.348
What are you doing here?

02:15.816 --> 02:17.584
Actually,
I'm delivering something,

02:19.152 --> 02:20.286
from my mother.

02:24.825 --> 02:25.859
A summons?

02:25.892 --> 02:27.093
And complaint.

02:27.127 --> 02:29.563
She's maintaining you
defamed her during my trial.

02:29.596 --> 02:30.997
She's suing me?

02:31.031 --> 02:32.533
RUSSELL: I tried to talk her
out of suing you, but...

02:32.566 --> 02:34.601
she, of course,
thinks I'm biased towards you

02:34.635 --> 02:36.202
due to my sexual attraction.

02:38.471 --> 02:40.340
I told her,
"Nonsense...

02:40.373 --> 02:42.543
One can have a crush
and still be objective."

02:43.176 --> 02:44.277
Don't you agree?

02:46.012 --> 02:48.414
I would agree
your conduct rises

02:48.448 --> 02:50.450
to the level of an assault.

02:51.184 --> 02:54.420
You will be arrested
within the hour, Mr. Bakey.

02:55.656 --> 02:56.857
That's hostile.

03:00.634 --> 03:05.572
(music playing)

03:50.717 --> 03:52.385
DONNELL: It's been a week,
Your Honor.

03:52.418 --> 03:53.787
Clearly Ms. Dole and Ms. Wyatt

03:53.820 --> 03:54.821
aren't going to reveal

03:54.855 --> 03:56.122
the location of the body.

03:56.156 --> 03:58.725
FIELD: A week is nothing
weighed against the stakes.

03:58.759 --> 04:00.534
DONNELL: If we were talking
about a live hostage,

04:00.567 --> 04:01.568
that would be one thing,

04:01.602 --> 04:04.871
but Cindy Burns is dead.

04:04.905 --> 04:06.940
Turn around and look at
Cindy Burns' parents

04:06.973 --> 04:08.809
and tell them
it means nothing

04:08.842 --> 04:10.611
to give their daughter
a decent burial.

04:10.644 --> 04:12.445
DONNELL: My heart
goes out to the parents,

04:12.478 --> 04:15.716
as does Lindsay Dole's,
as does Claire Wyatt's.

04:15.749 --> 04:19.285
But lawyer-client privilege
is sacrosanct.

04:19.319 --> 04:20.853
MANTLE: I don't wanna hear it,
counsel.

04:20.887 --> 04:23.423
They can either tell us
where the body is or go back.

04:23.456 --> 04:25.191
Well, then, at a minimum,
they deserve a hearing

04:25.225 --> 04:26.259
on the contempt issue.

04:26.292 --> 04:27.728
And pending that,

04:27.761 --> 04:29.129
as a matter of law,

04:29.162 --> 04:30.731
bail has to be set.

04:31.431 --> 04:34.467
I'll schedule a hearing
for July the 1st.

04:34.501 --> 04:36.836
Bail is set at $10 million,

04:36.870 --> 04:40.106
each, cash, no bond.

04:40.707 --> 04:41.775
(gavel bangs)

04:46.279 --> 04:47.514
Clearly, a district attorney

04:47.548 --> 04:49.816
enjoys immunity for statements
made during a trial.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.051
Qualified immunity,

04:51.084 --> 04:53.086
and there have
to be boundaries.

04:53.119 --> 04:55.488
Ms. Gamble basically
accused my client

04:55.522 --> 04:58.058
of having a sexual relationship
with her son.

04:58.091 --> 05:01.868
Sylvia Bakey's reputation
has been seriously stained.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.204
She has been discharged
from her place of employment.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.706
The question was there.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.574
Her ex-husband
alleged child abuse

05:07.608 --> 05:08.875
during the divorce proceeding.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.811
PEDERSON:
She had no good-faith basis

05:10.844 --> 05:13.547
to accuse my client
of being a child molester.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.481
ARNELLO: You don't know
what she knew, counsel, so--

05:15.516 --> 05:16.917
KEMP: All right, hold on.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.185
Look, I'm loath
to erode the immunity

05:19.219 --> 05:21.254
of district attorneys
in criminal trials,

05:21.287 --> 05:23.990
but I have to agree
with counsel.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.794
We can't allow prosecutors
to simply launch baseless bombs

05:27.828 --> 05:30.096
which can destroy reputations

05:30.130 --> 05:32.265
without some good-faith basis.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.102
I'm gonna allow the plaintiff
to take discovery.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.070
Your Honor--
KEMP: Come back

05:37.103 --> 05:39.272
with a motion
for summary judgment

05:39.305 --> 05:40.974
if you think they come up empty,

05:41.007 --> 05:42.442
but I won't summarily kick it.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.510
I don't believe this.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.778
KEMP: And, Ms. Gamble,

05:44.811 --> 05:46.647
I'm extremely distressed

05:46.680 --> 05:49.315
to learn you issued
an arrest warrant for Mr. Bakey.

05:49.349 --> 05:53.587
As you know, using the threat
of criminal prosecution

05:53.620 --> 05:55.355
to discourage a civil lawsuit

05:55.388 --> 05:57.658
is grounds for disbarment.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.834
That arrest warrant is quashed,

06:00.867 --> 06:03.937
and I'll trust you to use
better judgment in the future.

06:04.838 --> 06:05.471
That's all.

06:05.506 --> 06:06.472
(gavel bangs)

06:11.177 --> 06:13.013
I'll make this go away.
Don't worry.

06:17.751 --> 06:19.520
Looks like we'll all be
spending some time together.

06:19.953 --> 06:21.955
Listen to me, Russell--
Helen!

06:22.923 --> 06:24.691
Ms. Gamble is represented,
Mr. Bakey.

06:24.725 --> 06:26.627
You're to have
no communication with her.

06:34.568 --> 06:35.636
What was that all about?

06:35.669 --> 06:38.038
You're not
gonna believe it, mom.

06:38.071 --> 06:39.172
She's in love with me.

06:42.108 --> 06:43.143
What?

06:43.176 --> 06:45.245
She just told me
she had feelings for me.

06:46.379 --> 06:47.648
BERLUTI: Russell,

06:48.749 --> 06:50.483
may I have a word
in private, please?

06:52.352 --> 06:53.587
Yes, of course.

06:57.724 --> 06:58.925
What are you doing?

06:58.959 --> 07:00.734
My mother,

07:00.767 --> 07:02.836
she's insisting
on suing her.

07:02.869 --> 07:04.270
I tried to dissuade her.

07:04.304 --> 07:06.773
I'm beginning to think
she's not well, Jimmy.

07:07.674 --> 07:09.142
Did you make a remark

07:09.175 --> 07:11.277
that you were sexually
attracted to Helen Gamble?

07:11.311 --> 07:13.313
Is it a crime?

07:13.346 --> 07:14.848
Tell me you've
never thought about her.

07:14.881 --> 07:17.217
Listen to what
I'm saying, Russell.

07:17.818 --> 07:20.086
Helen Gamble
is a friend of mine.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.189
If you're implying
that I would hurt her,

07:23.223 --> 07:25.258
I'm very much offended, Jimmy.

07:32.966 --> 07:35.135
FIELD: Ms. Dole,
you're free to go.

07:35.168 --> 07:36.436
The judge has
had a change of heart.

07:38.071 --> 07:39.339
Have a lovely day.

07:43.009 --> 07:43.977
What about Claire?

07:44.010 --> 07:45.311
She stays.
What?

07:45.345 --> 07:47.280
Why?
FIELD: We consider her

07:47.313 --> 07:48.582
a bigger threat to society.

07:48.615 --> 07:49.415
What?

07:50.584 --> 07:51.818
They think they can crack you.

07:51.852 --> 07:53.353
I'm staying right here.

07:53.386 --> 07:54.521
You don't have that right.

07:54.555 --> 07:56.089
DOLE: As her lawyer,
I can certainly--

07:56.122 --> 07:57.390
Visiting hours are over.

07:57.423 --> 07:59.626
Guard, will you please
escort Ms. Dole out?

07:59.660 --> 08:01.301
I would like to have
a conversation with her before--

08:01.334 --> 08:02.769
You've had plenty
of time to talk.

08:02.803 --> 08:04.971
I won't be telling
you anything, you pig.

08:05.706 --> 08:07.207
That's certainly your call.

08:09.175 --> 08:10.877
As I said,
have a lovely day.

08:17.951 --> 08:20.253
They obviously feel
they can wear her down

08:20.286 --> 08:21.287
if I'm not with her.

08:21.321 --> 08:23.223
Physically divide and conquer.

08:24.257 --> 08:25.792
Will they wear her down?

08:25.826 --> 08:26.560
I don't think so.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.928
She's pretty tough.

08:29.295 --> 08:31.565
Bobby, why weren't you

08:32.265 --> 08:34.100
(sighs) never mind.

08:35.802 --> 08:37.003
Why wasn't I what?

08:37.037 --> 08:38.337
Well...

08:39.371 --> 08:41.207
I thought the point of you
arguing this morning

08:41.241 --> 08:43.076
was to get a little
added emotion on our side,

08:43.109 --> 08:45.278
a husband fighting
to free his wife.

08:45.311 --> 08:46.513
And?

08:46.547 --> 08:48.114
DOLE: And you pretty much argued

08:48.148 --> 08:50.116
like I was just another client.

08:50.784 --> 08:53.453
(scoffs) You even
called me Ms. Dole.

08:53.486 --> 08:55.055
What's with that?

08:55.856 --> 08:57.457
A little feeling
would have been nice,

08:57.490 --> 08:58.224
don't you think?

08:58.258 --> 09:00.026
A little feeling?

09:00.060 --> 09:02.135
You're accusing me
of not feeling?

09:02.703 --> 09:04.270
What does that
supposed to mean?

09:14.615 --> 09:15.816
May I help you?

09:15.849 --> 09:17.651
Delivery for Lindsay Dole.

09:17.684 --> 09:19.152
We'll talk later, okay?

09:27.127 --> 09:28.428
What are you doing here?

09:28.461 --> 09:30.430
I need to know
what's going on.

09:30.463 --> 09:32.733
DOLE: Stanley, it's dangerous
for you to show up here.

09:32.766 --> 09:35.235
That's why I'm disguised
as a messenger.

09:35.268 --> 09:36.202
Where's Claire?

09:36.236 --> 09:37.137
They're still holding her.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.438
Evidently, they believe
they can appeal

09:38.471 --> 09:39.606
to her conscience.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.509
I didn't mean to cause you
these problems.

09:43.143 --> 09:45.846
I owe you my life

09:45.879 --> 09:48.081
and now I'm causing you
such problems.

09:48.114 --> 09:49.716
Claire and I will be okay,

09:49.750 --> 09:50.717
but you...

09:50.751 --> 09:52.052
you're gonna get caught
by coming here.

09:52.085 --> 09:53.620
Is it this judge?

09:54.420 --> 09:55.889
He seems crazy.

09:56.890 --> 09:57.991
What if...

09:58.992 --> 10:00.366
he were to disappear?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.202
What?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.037
I could make a delivery to him.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.006
If you're even suggesting

10:06.039 --> 10:08.108
what I think
you're suggesting...

10:08.141 --> 10:09.576
DEEKS: It's just that...

10:10.043 --> 10:11.578
I owe you...

10:11.612 --> 10:12.879
everything.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.651
The thought of somebody
causing you pain...

10:17.684 --> 10:18.852
DOLE: Stanley,

10:18.885 --> 10:21.688
you will not be making
any deliveries to the judge

10:21.722 --> 10:23.757
or involve yourself
in this in any way.

10:24.525 --> 10:27.293
If you do, I will go
to the police myself

10:27.327 --> 10:28.662
and turn you in.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.331
Are we clear?

10:32.098 --> 10:33.800
The idea of somebody

10:33.834 --> 10:36.737
hurting you or Claire--

10:36.770 --> 10:37.671
(knocks on door)

10:38.572 --> 10:40.641
(door opens)

10:40.674 --> 10:42.008
Ms. Dole,

10:42.042 --> 10:43.677
may I speak with you?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.182
I'm afraid I can't.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.084
It'll only just
take a second.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.887
DOLE: I believe I signed
for the package, sir.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.756
You may leave.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.571
I know that you have

11:04.605 --> 11:06.907
your professional
responsibilities,

11:06.940 --> 11:08.675
but I also know that...

11:09.475 --> 11:11.011
that you're a mother.

11:11.645 --> 11:12.713
And if I could just appeal--

11:12.746 --> 11:14.548
DOLE: I'm sorry, Mrs. Burns,

11:14.581 --> 11:16.583
but I can't have
this conversation,

11:16.617 --> 11:18.118
and I must ask you to leave.

11:18.151 --> 11:21.021
Please tell me
where my daughter is.

11:23.123 --> 11:24.625
I really need you to leave.

11:29.095 --> 11:30.463
(sighs)

11:35.068 --> 11:36.136
(door closes)

11:39.540 --> 11:40.674
(sighs)

11:45.078 --> 11:47.413
You can't hold me like this.

11:47.447 --> 11:49.182
And I have a Sixth Amendment
right to counsel.

11:49.215 --> 11:50.884
You can't even legally
talk to me.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.519
FIELD: Claire,
your constitutional rights

11:52.553 --> 11:54.855
are only relevant
should you be put on trial.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.157
We don't plan
to put you on trial.

11:57.190 --> 11:58.625
Then why am I in jail?!

11:58.659 --> 12:01.802
FIELD: Look, I know
you're agonizing over this,

12:01.835 --> 12:03.369
but believe it or not,

12:03.403 --> 12:06.540
the law allows you to tell us
the location of the body.

12:06.573 --> 12:08.842
In fact, in not telling us,

12:08.875 --> 12:11.612
you're possibly at risk
for concealing evidence.

12:12.412 --> 12:13.680
Are you threatening me now?

12:13.714 --> 12:14.380
FIELD: No.

12:14.715 --> 12:15.882
I'm just saying,

12:15.916 --> 12:19.085
you can legally
follow your conscience here.

12:26.827 --> 12:28.261
Also...

12:28.294 --> 12:30.063
maybe I'm talking
out of turn here,

12:30.096 --> 12:31.598
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

12:32.933 --> 12:35.035
For criminal attorneys
like Lindsay Dole

12:35.068 --> 12:36.703
and Bobby Donnell
and so forth,

12:36.737 --> 12:38.705
reputation doesn't matter.

12:38.739 --> 12:42.008
The only thing that counts
is your win-loss record.

12:42.042 --> 12:43.744
But for civil attorneys,

12:43.777 --> 12:45.746
which I believe
is what you plan to be,

12:45.779 --> 12:49.182
reputation is everything.

12:49.215 --> 12:51.184
And what you're doing now

12:51.217 --> 12:53.319
refusing to reveal
to grieving parents

12:53.353 --> 12:54.921
where their
deceased daughter is,

12:55.488 --> 12:58.391
your reputation
may never recover from it.

12:58.925 --> 12:59.926
Help yourself.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.035
I'm trying
to be your friend here.

13:04.337 --> 13:05.839
Mr. Field,

13:07.641 --> 13:10.076
you're trying to get me
to break privilege.

13:11.077 --> 13:13.547
When it comes
to a lawyer's reputation,

13:13.580 --> 13:15.148
nothing is more important

13:15.181 --> 13:17.851
than honoring
attorney-client privilege.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.253
It would disgrace me
to violate it.

13:21.054 --> 13:23.456
So, don't pretend
to be my friend here.

13:23.489 --> 13:25.225
I'm telling you nothing.

13:26.359 --> 13:28.529
You can keep me
locked up here forever.

13:28.562 --> 13:31.131
I'm telling you nothing.

13:40.073 --> 13:43.009
(engine revving)

13:47.047 --> 13:48.048
Need a jump?

13:52.152 --> 13:53.219
I'm not a mechanic,

13:53.253 --> 13:54.821
but I think
you flooded it a little.

13:55.355 --> 13:58.058
(phone beeping)

13:58.091 --> 14:01.034
(engine revving)

14:03.169 --> 14:06.006
Come near me again,
I'll have you shot dead.

14:07.808 --> 14:10.777
(tires screech)

14:14.748 --> 14:16.016
Trying to help.

14:21.454 --> 14:22.989
I talked to him once, Helen.

14:23.023 --> 14:24.791
YOUNG: Maybe you should go
for a restraining order.

14:24.825 --> 14:26.226
With what?
He certainly

14:26.259 --> 14:27.561
had a right
to be in the building.

14:27.594 --> 14:29.129
My car didn't start, so--

14:29.162 --> 14:29.996
Was it tampered with?

14:30.463 --> 14:31.297
How would I know?

14:31.331 --> 14:32.432
Maybe I did flood it.

14:32.465 --> 14:34.334
I didn't dust the hood
for his prints.

14:34.367 --> 14:36.269
BERLUTI: Helen,
put the police on him.

14:36.302 --> 14:38.371
You have more resources
than we do.

14:38.404 --> 14:40.907
In which case I'm accused
of using the threat

14:40.941 --> 14:44.210
of prosecution to discourage
a civil lawsuit.

14:44.244 --> 14:46.212
Come on, I'll be hauled
before the bar.

14:46.246 --> 14:47.814
But if you think
he's threatening you--

14:47.848 --> 14:50.584
GAMBLE: Eugene,
I have no proof.

14:51.518 --> 14:53.219
Without asking you to violate

14:53.253 --> 14:55.822
your attorney-client privilege,

14:56.122 --> 14:57.691
could he have--

14:57.724 --> 14:59.893
what am I dealing with here?

14:59.926 --> 15:01.902
Can you tell me that?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.140
I'm in a lawsuit with them.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.677
What exactly am I dealing with?

15:10.711 --> 15:12.813
Look, if he does anything else,

15:12.846 --> 15:14.147
I'd go for the
restraining order.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.349
It's his mother's lawsuit.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.984
He doesn't necessarily
have the right

15:18.018 --> 15:19.553
to be in the room
all the time.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.023
GAMBLE: I'd like to get
a restraining order now,

15:23.056 --> 15:25.559
but I need more to get it.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.629
Could you please
give me something?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.201
Great.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.105
Thanks.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.312
(sighs)

15:49.783 --> 15:51.084
FIELD: Claire,

15:52.719 --> 15:54.220
these are Cindy's parents,

15:54.254 --> 15:56.056
John and Marsha Burns.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.559
Okay, that does it!
Get me my lawyer!

15:58.592 --> 15:59.860
You don't automatically have--

15:59.893 --> 16:01.735
I will scream
and continue to scream

16:01.768 --> 16:02.869
until I meet with my attorney.

16:02.903 --> 16:04.070
Do not think I am kidding.

16:04.104 --> 16:06.640
I just want you to hear
what they have to say.

16:06.673 --> 16:09.610
(screams)

16:11.144 --> 16:12.813
DOLE: It's one thing
to incarcerate somebody.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.147
It's another to subject her

16:14.180 --> 16:15.949
to this kind
of blatant coercion.

16:15.982 --> 16:18.251
The parents just wanted
to talk to her.

16:18.284 --> 16:19.285
Right.

16:19.319 --> 16:20.320
MANTLE: There's nothing illegal

16:20.353 --> 16:22.322
about coercive interrogation,
counsel.

16:22.355 --> 16:24.190
You just can't use
the fruits of it at trial.

16:24.224 --> 16:25.559
DOLE: The Sixth Amendment says,

16:25.592 --> 16:27.393
"All questions have to stop

16:27.427 --> 16:29.830
once a suspect
asks for a lawyer."

16:29.863 --> 16:31.497
That's not an evidentiary rule.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.833
It's in the Bill of Rights.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.901
MANTLE: Look,
short of physical torture,

16:34.935 --> 16:36.770
they can
do anything they want.

16:36.803 --> 16:38.004
If they wanna use it
as evidence,

16:38.038 --> 16:39.105
that's a different story.

16:39.139 --> 16:41.608
But so far, your only remedy

16:41.642 --> 16:43.510
could be a civil lawsuit,

16:43.544 --> 16:45.211
in which case I'd say
"Good luck."

16:45.245 --> 16:47.047
This is an abuse
of their discretion,

16:47.080 --> 16:48.749
Your Honor, and yours.

16:48.782 --> 16:50.884
Tell somebody who cares.

16:50.917 --> 16:54.220
If Claire Wyatt wants out,
she knows what to do.

16:54.755 --> 16:55.622
We're adjourned.

16:55.656 --> 16:56.690
(gavel bangs)

17:00.601 --> 17:02.468
(sighs)

17:02.503 --> 17:03.504
Any ideas?

17:03.537 --> 17:05.739
Jamie's drafting
an interlocutory appeal

17:05.771 --> 17:07.207
on abuse-of-discretion grounds.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.409
I'm not sure we'll have
any luck, but--

17:10.143 --> 17:11.144
DONNELL: Lindsay?

17:12.045 --> 17:12.813
Are you listening?

17:13.479 --> 17:14.214
What?

17:14.247 --> 17:15.281
Yeah, that sounds good.

17:15.315 --> 17:16.983
Let's file an appeal.

17:19.484 --> 17:20.686
What are you looking at?

17:21.421 --> 17:22.522
Nothing.

17:30.463 --> 17:34.000
Did you tell my son
you'd have him shot dead?

17:35.168 --> 17:36.336
Mrs. Bakey,

17:36.369 --> 17:38.038
we're adversaries
in a lawsuit.

17:38.071 --> 17:38.972
We both have lawyers.

17:39.005 --> 17:41.274
If a person threatens my son,

17:41.307 --> 17:42.509
I tend to be direct.

17:42.543 --> 17:43.810
You're here taking issue

17:43.844 --> 17:45.579
with me threatening your son?

17:45.612 --> 17:47.881
SYLVIA: What, I'm supposed
to be okay with it?

17:47.914 --> 17:49.816
Your son's a serial killer.

17:49.850 --> 17:52.485
You couldn't prove it
to a jury, Ms. Gamble.

17:52.519 --> 17:54.921
You will never prove it
to me, I assure you.

17:54.955 --> 17:58.458
Well, I don't have
to prove it to you.

17:58.491 --> 17:59.893
You're the one person who knows

17:59.926 --> 18:01.768
he wasn't home alone
with you those nights.

18:03.369 --> 18:05.672
I didn't come here to fight,
Ms. Gamble. Just--

18:08.274 --> 18:09.075
Russell...

18:09.109 --> 18:11.545
swears to me...

18:11.578 --> 18:14.548
that you threatened
to have him shot dead.

18:14.581 --> 18:16.817
Did you really say that?

18:19.352 --> 18:20.921
I did, yes.

18:22.789 --> 18:24.725
Did you also...

18:25.526 --> 18:27.761
give him some indication

18:29.195 --> 18:31.364
that you might love him?

18:32.933 --> 18:34.234
What?

18:34.267 --> 18:36.803
You gave him
no such indication?

18:37.370 --> 18:38.739
I think not.

18:42.108 --> 18:44.010
Mrs. Bakey, hold on.

18:46.312 --> 18:48.381
So, you're not here
to confront me,

18:48.414 --> 18:50.016
but rather to determine

18:50.050 --> 18:52.418
whether Russell's
being honest with you?

18:53.987 --> 18:55.722
Your son's been acquitted.

18:55.756 --> 18:57.457
He can't be retried.

18:57.490 --> 18:59.526
Double jeopardy
prevents that.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.935
Was he home with you
those nights?

19:03.770 --> 19:05.706
If you have reasonable doubt

19:05.739 --> 19:07.941
then I guess you agree
with the jury's verdict.

19:07.974 --> 19:10.711
I don't care
about the jury's verdict,

19:10.744 --> 19:12.412
nor do I have any interest

19:12.445 --> 19:14.615
in prosecuting you
for perjury.

19:15.048 --> 19:16.750
It's understandable.

19:16.783 --> 19:20.754
Any mother would want
to protect her son.

19:20.787 --> 19:23.857
But it would not
be understandable to do so

19:23.890 --> 19:26.192
at the expense
of others' lives.

19:26.226 --> 19:29.195
Mrs. Bakey, what if
he should kill again?

19:30.196 --> 19:32.899
He's not a killer.

19:33.199 --> 19:34.300
GAMBLE: He's threatened me.

19:34.935 --> 19:36.436
He approached me
in the parking lot

19:36.469 --> 19:38.939
this afternoon
with jumper cables.

19:38.972 --> 19:40.741
I beg your pardon?

19:40.774 --> 19:42.609
GAMBLE:
Yes, my car wouldn't start,

19:42.643 --> 19:45.679
and suddenly, here he comes
offering to help.

19:47.714 --> 19:49.082
Mrs. Bakey,

19:50.083 --> 19:52.886
I received this message
during his trial.

19:55.288 --> 19:57.423
If you didn't send this,

19:58.759 --> 20:00.100
he did.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.039
Whose idea
was it really to sue me?

20:07.073 --> 20:08.308
Yours...

20:09.510 --> 20:10.811
or his?

20:18.619 --> 20:19.953
What else did she say?

20:19.986 --> 20:21.855
GAMBLE: It's what
she didn't say.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.489
If I read her correctly,

20:23.524 --> 20:26.326
I think it's now
dawning on her,

20:26.359 --> 20:28.595
her son might actually
be a murderer.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.565
What good it does us now,
I don't know,

20:31.598 --> 20:33.634
since he's already
been acquitted.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.305
What?
What are you thinking?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.007
There may be a way.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.476
Do you think this woman
would actually help us now?

20:44.110 --> 20:45.546
I don't know.

20:45.579 --> 20:48.148
She seemed pretty conflicted
when she left my office.

20:48.849 --> 20:51.818
Set up a little settlement
conference on your lawsuit.

20:53.887 --> 20:55.388
There may be a way.

20:58.592 --> 20:59.660
(knocks on door)

21:00.801 --> 21:01.802
Hey.

21:02.235 --> 21:03.236
Hey.

21:07.273 --> 21:08.308
DONNELL: Lindsay...

21:09.142 --> 21:11.011
we seem to be in a stage

21:11.044 --> 21:14.347
of not communicating again.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.117
Oh, it's just a stage?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.285
I'm sorry. I guess

21:19.319 --> 21:20.453
I should
be relieved to know

21:20.486 --> 21:22.756
that you at least
consider it a problem.

21:24.357 --> 21:25.425
Look at that.

21:26.392 --> 21:27.728
I come in to talk,

21:27.761 --> 21:30.330
and you start attacking me.

21:30.363 --> 21:31.898
DOLE: I'm not attacking you.

21:32.733 --> 21:35.035
When's the last time
we talked about anything?

21:35.068 --> 21:36.537
You know what?

21:36.570 --> 21:37.504
Forget it.

21:37.538 --> 21:38.238
Ah.

21:38.271 --> 21:39.072
No, don't go "Ah."

21:39.105 --> 21:41.407
I came in here to talk!

21:41.441 --> 21:44.911
For the record,
you shut it down, not me.

21:51.585 --> 21:53.319
And get this package
out of here.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.021
It practically
blocks the hall.

21:55.455 --> 21:56.790
What package?

22:04.905 --> 22:06.139
Oh, no.

22:11.311 --> 22:12.579
I think it's her!

22:12.613 --> 22:13.814
What?

22:13.847 --> 22:15.248
I think that package
is Cindy Burns,

22:15.281 --> 22:16.983
the 14-year-old.

22:17.551 --> 22:19.520
I--my client was upset
about Claire being held,

22:19.553 --> 22:21.054
and he felt bad
for the parents, and--

22:21.087 --> 22:22.656
He sent you the body?

22:22.689 --> 22:24.090
DOLE: I don't know.

22:24.124 --> 22:25.025
I don't know.

22:25.058 --> 22:26.292
But it doesn't say what it is

22:26.326 --> 22:27.528
or where it came from.

22:27.561 --> 22:29.062
I just have a bad feeling.

22:35.101 --> 22:36.469
MAN: Okay. Come on. Work.

22:36.503 --> 22:37.270
Work.

22:39.439 --> 22:40.473
MAN: All clear.

22:40.507 --> 22:42.442
McGUIRE: Okay.
Let's open it up.

22:46.379 --> 22:47.681
No note? Nothing?

22:47.714 --> 22:48.515
No.

22:53.019 --> 22:54.254
You didn't see
anybody drop it off?

22:54.287 --> 22:55.088
No.

22:55.121 --> 22:58.058
(music playing)

23:16.983 --> 23:17.884
McGUIRE: Okay.

23:18.585 --> 23:19.753
Get the coroner.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.487
I need you

23:21.522 --> 23:23.156
and I need you
for questioning.

23:31.898 --> 23:33.199
I don't understand.

23:33.867 --> 23:35.368
Why can't I be here?

23:35.401 --> 23:37.571
ARNELLO: Because
it's a settlement conference.

23:37.604 --> 23:38.939
Only the parties themselves

23:38.972 --> 23:39.640
may be present.

23:39.673 --> 23:40.306
Why is he here?

23:40.340 --> 23:42.442
I'm here as counsel,

23:42.475 --> 23:44.144
Mr. Serial killer.

23:44.177 --> 23:46.046
SYLVIA:
It's okay, Russell.

23:46.412 --> 23:47.480
It's okay.

23:48.414 --> 23:50.350
They're planning
to terrorize you, mother.

23:50.383 --> 23:52.418
I'll protect
your mother, Russell.

23:52.452 --> 23:53.520
Go ahead.

24:04.738 --> 24:07.007
GAMBLE: Mrs. Bakey,
I think we're all

24:07.040 --> 24:09.075
on the same side here

24:09.109 --> 24:10.944
feeling your son needs help.

24:10.977 --> 24:12.245
What's going on here?

24:12.278 --> 24:13.847
SYLVIA: Is that
what this is all about?

24:13.880 --> 24:15.616
You said you had an offer.

24:15.649 --> 24:17.050
GAMBLE: We do have an offer.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.985
It would involve me retracting

24:19.019 --> 24:21.454
my defamatory comments.

24:21.487 --> 24:23.023
It would involve us agreeing

24:23.056 --> 24:26.226
not to prosecute
Mrs. Bakey for perjury,

24:26.259 --> 24:28.128
but it would also involve

24:28.161 --> 24:30.764
Mrs. Bakey's full cooperation

24:30.797 --> 24:32.799
in preventing other women

24:32.833 --> 24:34.367
from being killed

24:34.400 --> 24:36.837
and getting her son
the medical help

24:36.870 --> 24:39.405
he so desperately needs.

24:39.439 --> 24:42.208
We're not talking
about prison or jail.

24:43.043 --> 24:45.011
We are talking
about Russell

24:45.045 --> 24:46.780
being civilly committed.

24:49.816 --> 24:53.353
Mrs. Bakey,
he will kill again.

24:54.621 --> 24:56.690
I believe
you know that.

25:02.603 --> 25:03.804
In a package?

25:03.837 --> 25:05.305
We'll talk
about it later, Claire.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.007
It was just delivered
to you?

25:07.040 --> 25:08.108
Later.

25:08.141 --> 25:09.743
Was it FedEx
or regular mail?

25:09.776 --> 25:10.944
Later, Claire.

25:12.045 --> 25:13.113
GAMBLE: The bottom line

25:13.146 --> 25:15.415
is we can't do it
without you.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.519
The standard is so high.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.588
How long
would he go away for?

25:21.622 --> 25:23.524
WALSH: Could be
as short as four days,

25:23.557 --> 25:25.425
as long as six months.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.128
And if it's determined

25:28.161 --> 25:30.731
that he still
poses a danger,

25:30.764 --> 25:32.365
he could be held longer.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.267
ARNELLO: The main thing

25:34.300 --> 25:36.169
is to get him treatment.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.505
Nobody here
wants another death.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.976
I still can't believe
he did...

25:44.344 --> 25:45.912
those awful things.

25:46.847 --> 25:50.083
The issue is whether
he might do it again.

25:51.351 --> 25:53.720
WALSH: We know
you love your son, Mrs. Bakey,

25:53.754 --> 25:56.523
but he needs you to step in now

25:56.557 --> 25:58.224
and be a parent.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.470
They're gonna section 12 him.

26:04.505 --> 26:05.672
They're gonna what?

26:05.706 --> 26:06.707
Section 12 him.

26:06.740 --> 26:07.941
STRINGER: What's
a section 12?

26:07.974 --> 26:09.209
BERLUTI:
Civil commitment.

26:09.242 --> 26:10.143
YOUNG: Who called you?

26:10.176 --> 26:11.044
Russell called,

26:11.077 --> 26:12.112
confused
as to why he had

26:12.145 --> 26:13.213
to suddenly go
to court.

26:13.246 --> 26:15.481
I called
the clerk's office.

26:15.516 --> 26:16.717
They're gonna
section 12 him.

26:16.750 --> 26:17.818
How?

26:17.851 --> 26:18.685
What have they got?

26:18.719 --> 26:20.020
He's a wacko psycho,

26:20.053 --> 26:20.987
that's what they've got.

26:21.021 --> 26:22.689
He asked us
to represent him.

26:22.723 --> 26:23.990
And you said no.

26:24.024 --> 26:24.725
BERLUTI: Ellenor,

26:24.758 --> 26:25.592
I don't like the guy,

26:25.626 --> 26:26.693
but this isn't right.

26:26.727 --> 26:27.828
What they're trying
to do here is--

26:27.861 --> 26:30.864
You said no.

26:36.537 --> 26:37.938
I'll tell him no.

26:41.842 --> 26:43.744
DOLE: So, who will
represent him, then?

26:43.777 --> 26:45.779
DONNELL: (sighs)
They'll appoint somebody.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.314
I talked to Helen.

26:48.348 --> 26:50.617
I mean she really
is freaked out by the guy.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.819
How couldn't she be?

26:53.820 --> 26:55.355
It's not like her to scare.

26:59.793 --> 27:01.101
Okay.

27:01.134 --> 27:02.769
8:00.

27:02.803 --> 27:04.437
It's late enough
to go home.

27:05.205 --> 27:06.807
What do you mean by that?

27:06.840 --> 27:09.910
I mean by the time
we go home, eat,

27:09.943 --> 27:11.377
get Bobby Jr. tucked in,

27:11.411 --> 27:13.614
it'll be close to 9:30, 10:00,

27:13.647 --> 27:15.549
we'll be officially
too tired to talk

27:15.582 --> 27:17.150
and we can go to bed,

27:18.451 --> 27:19.653
putting off communication

27:19.686 --> 27:21.287
for yet another day.

27:25.859 --> 27:27.293
You know why...

27:27.327 --> 27:29.229
we put off
communication, Bobby?

27:30.330 --> 27:31.832
Because we have a son.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.000
It's important to him

27:34.034 --> 27:35.468
that we be together,

27:36.402 --> 27:37.671
that we be happy together,

27:37.704 --> 27:39.740
that we feel happy
individually.

27:40.707 --> 27:42.408
I mean how would we ever go on
pretending all that

27:42.442 --> 27:45.512
if we actually address
what's going on between us?

27:48.348 --> 27:50.116
Say what you have
to say, Lindsay.

27:51.284 --> 27:52.753
Okay.

27:52.786 --> 27:54.655
I've been trying
to get you to talk

27:54.688 --> 27:55.889
for a year.

27:57.524 --> 27:58.825
You're the one always
too tired,

27:58.859 --> 28:00.300
too overwhelmed by work.

28:01.067 --> 28:02.636
I've been trying
to get you to go to therapy.

28:02.669 --> 28:03.704
You say
you don't believe in it.

28:03.737 --> 28:05.706
Now because I fail to tell you

28:05.739 --> 28:07.574
where some dead body is,

28:07.608 --> 28:08.609
you're alarmed

28:08.642 --> 28:10.877
over our communication
problems?

28:10.911 --> 28:13.113
I mean how do you figure me
to understand that,

28:13.146 --> 28:14.648
to not be angry over it?

28:21.755 --> 28:22.889
Think back.

28:24.758 --> 28:26.960
Try to remember
the last time you touched me.

28:27.861 --> 28:30.196
Our sex life could be
symptomatic

28:30.230 --> 28:32.566
of our communication
problem.

28:33.399 --> 28:34.935
That doesn't occur to you?

28:36.737 --> 28:38.271
Excellent answer.

28:38.304 --> 28:39.773
Here's what occurs to me.

28:43.176 --> 28:44.711
You're not in love with me.

28:47.714 --> 28:51.017
And I may not be
a mind reader, but...

28:52.218 --> 28:54.821
I can certainly tell when--

28:54.855 --> 28:57.023
given your newfound
commitment to the truth,

28:57.057 --> 28:58.692
let's just commit to it.

29:02.503 --> 29:03.970
You're not in love with me.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.608
(sighs)

29:10.811 --> 29:12.445
(knocks on door)

29:12.478 --> 29:14.247
(door opens)

29:14.280 --> 29:15.749
Delivery
for Lindsay Dole.

29:20.687 --> 29:21.922
Get in here.

29:25.358 --> 29:26.259
Bobby,
give me a second

29:26.292 --> 29:27.761
with the flower man,
would you?

29:27.794 --> 29:28.962
Excuse me?
He's a client.

29:29.563 --> 29:30.196
I need a minute.

29:30.230 --> 29:31.397
It's private. Go.

29:32.599 --> 29:33.800
Now, please?

29:41.274 --> 29:42.442
All right,
now, you listen--

29:42.475 --> 29:44.344
I was just--
You don't talk!

29:44.377 --> 29:45.779
You're to walk out that door

29:45.812 --> 29:47.480
and never come back.

29:48.048 --> 29:49.783
You don't deliver
any packages.

29:49.816 --> 29:51.652
Do I make myself clear?

29:52.786 --> 29:53.787
Yes.

29:53.820 --> 29:55.088
DOLE: You say
you wanna get help,

29:55.121 --> 29:56.857
but you don't really want that.

29:56.890 --> 29:57.791
What you really want

29:57.824 --> 29:59.259
is to continue to live free.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.835
Well, let me tell you,
if that's your goal, do not.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.804
I repeat, do not have any direct

30:03.837 --> 30:06.372
or indirect contact
with me ever again,

30:06.406 --> 30:08.208
because the police
will be watching.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.048
Now, go.

30:18.318 --> 30:21.221
(music playing)

30:37.838 --> 30:40.340
WALSH: This is a complete
end around double jeopardy.

30:40.373 --> 30:42.275
If a person presents
the likelihood

30:42.308 --> 30:43.376
of serious harm,

30:43.409 --> 30:45.145
the court may order him confined

30:45.178 --> 30:47.147
to a mental facility
for a period of--

30:47.180 --> 30:48.549
Where's the evidence
that he poses

30:48.582 --> 30:49.315
such a likelihood?

30:49.349 --> 30:51.317
Three dead bodies.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.919
And he's still
prowling parking lots

30:52.953 --> 30:53.754
with jumper cables.

30:53.787 --> 30:55.255
Mr. Walsh, he was acquitted

30:55.288 --> 30:56.156
of those crimes.

30:56.189 --> 30:57.490
On the basis of an alibi

30:57.524 --> 30:58.825
which has now been recanted.

30:58.859 --> 31:00.060
WATSON: I don't care.

31:00.093 --> 31:01.802
As a matter of law,
he stands innocent

31:01.835 --> 31:02.636
of those murders.

31:02.669 --> 31:04.370
You certainly can't use those

31:04.404 --> 31:05.572
as evidence of guilt

31:05.606 --> 31:07.440
for the purpose
of a section 12 hearing.

31:07.473 --> 31:09.009
Your Honor,
his own mother

31:09.042 --> 31:10.376
stands before you
concerned

31:10.410 --> 31:11.444
about his mental health.

31:11.477 --> 31:12.879
Even she--
WATSON: If we started

31:12.913 --> 31:15.448
locking up people on the say-so
of concerned mothers,

31:15.481 --> 31:16.517
we'd all be in jail.

31:16.550 --> 31:18.752
You have a copy
of a message

31:19.485 --> 31:20.954
sent to Ms. Gamble,

31:21.421 --> 31:23.890
which message clearly threatens.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.527
Where's the evidence
that concludes he sent it?

31:26.560 --> 31:28.361
Look, what are you trying
to pull?

31:28.394 --> 31:30.330
You lose the criminal trial.

31:30.363 --> 31:31.832
You're just trying
to take another whack at it

31:31.865 --> 31:33.834
with the civil proceeding,
and what do you have?

31:33.867 --> 31:34.868
A concerned mother?

31:35.669 --> 31:36.870
WALSH: She lives with him.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.672
She loves him.

31:38.705 --> 31:40.574
But now she's tumbled
to the idea,

31:40.607 --> 31:42.776
"My God, my son
is a killer.

31:42.809 --> 31:44.745
He needs medical help.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.446
He may kill again."

31:46.479 --> 31:48.281
You're right.

31:48.314 --> 31:49.716
We can't get him criminally.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.552
Nor do we want to.

31:51.585 --> 31:53.754
But nor do we wanna sit back

31:53.787 --> 31:56.890
and wait for him
to take another life.

31:56.923 --> 31:58.592
Your problem is a little thing

31:58.625 --> 32:00.300
called the constitution.

32:01.001 --> 32:02.836
We don't take
freedom away from a man

32:02.869 --> 32:04.270
based on fear alone.

32:04.304 --> 32:05.471
We require evidence.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.073
We require proof

32:07.107 --> 32:09.075
beyond all reasonable doubt,

32:09.109 --> 32:10.176
whether it's a criminal trial

32:10.210 --> 32:11.344
or a section 12.

32:11.377 --> 32:12.613
I would submit
thousands of people

32:12.646 --> 32:14.581
are locked up
on the grounds of fear.

32:14.615 --> 32:15.916
Yes.

32:15.949 --> 32:17.818
We call them Arab-Americans.

32:17.851 --> 32:19.152
And if you're about to cite

32:19.185 --> 32:22.689
this country's despicable
material-witness scheme

32:22.723 --> 32:24.290
as support
for the government's right

32:24.324 --> 32:26.259
to incarcerate at will,

32:26.292 --> 32:27.127
I would submit

32:27.160 --> 32:29.029
that you've severely misstepped.

32:29.596 --> 32:31.632
This man, as a matter of law,

32:31.665 --> 32:34.400
has been judged innocent
of three crimes.

32:34.434 --> 32:35.669
You're actually in here

32:35.702 --> 32:37.137
trying to use those crimes

32:37.170 --> 32:38.271
as evidence against him

32:38.304 --> 32:40.173
to have him locked up civilly.

32:40.674 --> 32:41.608
That's outrageous.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.511
I don't care how
well-intentioned you are

32:44.545 --> 32:45.646
or how worried sick

32:45.679 --> 32:46.913
his mother may be.

32:47.581 --> 32:49.115
Your petition is denied.

32:49.650 --> 32:50.584
We're adjourned.

32:50.617 --> 32:51.585
(gavel bangs)

32:54.788 --> 32:55.622
Thank you.

32:55.656 --> 32:57.257
What you did was very brave.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.359
Oh, that's brave?

33:01.201 --> 33:02.202
You betrayed me, mother.

33:02.235 --> 33:03.136
Oh, Russell.

33:03.169 --> 33:04.571
You betrayed me.

33:05.371 --> 33:06.540
POPE: All right. Russell.

33:12.012 --> 33:13.246
And you...

33:24.658 --> 33:26.593
Aren't you afraid
he might turn on you?

33:26.627 --> 33:27.728
No.

33:27.761 --> 33:29.229
He's devoted to me.

33:29.262 --> 33:30.496
And you, for that matter.

33:30.531 --> 33:31.898
I mean, he would never--

33:33.667 --> 33:34.434
What?

33:41.775 --> 33:43.209
Excuse me.

33:43.243 --> 33:45.078
Lindsay, maybe we should...

33:45.111 --> 33:46.379
call the police.

33:51.217 --> 33:52.418
DOLE: Tell me why
I shouldn't report you

33:52.452 --> 33:53.654
for stalking?

33:53.687 --> 33:55.789
I will go away forever.

33:55.822 --> 33:57.524
I just couldn't leave
on bad terms.

33:57.558 --> 33:59.560
As I've said,

33:59.593 --> 34:01.635
you saved my life.

34:01.668 --> 34:03.003
I would do anything

34:03.036 --> 34:04.805
to either repay you or--

34:04.838 --> 34:07.107
and even though
you don't care to hear it,

34:07.140 --> 34:08.440
it's important for me
to say it.

34:08.474 --> 34:09.976
It's important to me
that you know

34:10.010 --> 34:12.012
how much I value your loyalty.

34:13.079 --> 34:14.214
I suppose

34:14.246 --> 34:15.748
I would like to be friends.

34:17.417 --> 34:19.920
But if you don't want that,

34:20.654 --> 34:23.223
I will honor your wish.

34:23.724 --> 34:24.456
DOLE: Stanley,

34:24.489 --> 34:26.492
we're not friends.

34:26.527 --> 34:28.728
You were a client.

34:28.762 --> 34:31.297
My loyalty to you
derived from duty.

34:34.868 --> 34:36.969
I don't want you
to be in my life.

34:37.003 --> 34:39.371
And I don't say that
to hurt you.

34:43.309 --> 34:44.511
See this woman?

34:45.145 --> 34:46.580
She's my best friend,

34:46.612 --> 34:48.614
my maid
of honor, my--

34:49.516 --> 34:51.717
and this man
is on the loose,

34:51.752 --> 34:53.418
a threat to her life.

34:54.054 --> 34:55.355
And how did he come
into her life?

34:55.388 --> 34:56.857
She's a D. A.,

34:56.889 --> 34:58.959
and she was just doing her job.

34:58.992 --> 35:00.567
You came into my life

35:00.601 --> 35:03.403
because I'm a criminal defense
lawyer doing my job.

35:07.841 --> 35:09.810
We wanna do our jobs

35:10.844 --> 35:12.312
and then be left alone.

35:14.548 --> 35:16.683
Can you understand that,
Stanley?

35:19.052 --> 35:19.953
Yes.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.459
I'm gonna say goodbye now.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.427
Okay?

35:28.995 --> 35:30.797
And you're going
to honor that.

35:33.867 --> 35:35.068
I promise.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.206
Okay.

35:40.240 --> 35:40.974
Bye.

35:42.275 --> 35:42.943
Bye.

35:54.454 --> 35:57.524
I think we blew it
by going in too soon.

35:57.558 --> 36:00.500
Now, even if we get more,

36:00.534 --> 36:02.435
well, our credibility
is suspect.

36:02.468 --> 36:04.204
WALSH: Only with that judge.

36:04.237 --> 36:06.172
We'll shop around
for somebody better.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.209
You want protective custody?

36:10.777 --> 36:13.413
He hasn't directly
done anything to me

36:13.446 --> 36:15.148
or said anything.

36:17.450 --> 36:18.885
But you're afraid.

36:20.821 --> 36:22.523
RUSSELL: Hmm,
talking about me, I hope.

36:25.959 --> 36:27.594
What do you want?

36:29.195 --> 36:31.532
I'd like to file
a missing persons report.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.167
I'm sorry?

36:34.200 --> 36:36.202
My mother, she...

36:36.770 --> 36:38.404
seems to have vanished.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.307
I looked everywhere.

36:43.710 --> 36:45.512
What have you done
to her?

36:46.012 --> 36:47.247
What have I done?

36:48.048 --> 36:50.483
There you go,
jumping to conclusions again.

36:50.517 --> 36:51.985
Where is she?

36:52.018 --> 36:53.920
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

36:53.954 --> 36:54.855
Could you help?

36:54.888 --> 36:58.158
She has to be missing
at least 24 hours.

36:58.191 --> 36:59.192
What's the saying?

36:59.225 --> 37:01.334
The eager beaver
catches the crook?

37:09.142 --> 37:10.777
I'd love it if you could...

37:11.310 --> 37:12.679
begin searching.

37:14.147 --> 37:15.782
I'm worried sick.

37:18.885 --> 37:21.822
(retreating footsteps)

37:23.323 --> 37:24.991
He's killed his mother.

37:37.170 --> 37:38.471
I'm happy to go to therapy

37:38.505 --> 37:39.840
if you think that'll...

37:40.907 --> 37:42.342
What do you think?

37:42.375 --> 37:43.443
DONNELL: Lindsay,

37:43.476 --> 37:45.311
please don't get Socratic.

37:45.345 --> 37:47.514
Let's just have
a conversation.

37:47.548 --> 37:48.949
And don't fire back at me

37:48.982 --> 37:50.584
my track record
for conversation.

37:50.617 --> 37:52.185
Let's just start clean.

37:52.218 --> 37:53.654
All right?

37:54.521 --> 37:55.656
Let's begin with the premise

37:55.689 --> 37:58.158
that I've done
everything wrong

37:58.191 --> 38:00.300
and "Where do we go
from here?"

38:00.801 --> 38:03.136
How do I start
to get things right?

38:04.971 --> 38:07.273
That was an incredibly
dishonest thing to say.

38:07.307 --> 38:08.341
What? I'm just--

38:08.374 --> 38:09.175
DOLE: Let's start
with the premise

38:09.209 --> 38:11.244
you've done everything wrong?

38:11.277 --> 38:13.413
You don't believe that,
not for a second.

38:13.446 --> 38:16.550
Why start with a premise
you believe to be a lie?

38:16.583 --> 38:18.484
(lightly chuckles)

38:19.185 --> 38:21.755
Why are you so angry?

38:22.989 --> 38:24.958
I'm angry...

38:26.292 --> 38:27.561
(sighs)

38:31.297 --> 38:32.599
at myself.

38:35.368 --> 38:36.302
Why?

38:37.671 --> 38:40.073
Oh, I'm humiliated
to even say it.

38:42.709 --> 38:45.546
For pretending day after day

38:45.579 --> 38:46.680
after day

38:46.713 --> 38:47.814
that my husband's
in love with me

38:47.848 --> 38:49.583
when I know he's not.

38:50.817 --> 38:53.720
Lindsay, for God's sake.

38:53.754 --> 38:55.288
Of course I love you.

38:55.321 --> 38:57.023
DOLE: I know you love me.

38:57.057 --> 39:00.026
But (sighs)

39:03.203 --> 39:04.771
I miss being adored.

39:06.239 --> 39:07.440
I miss--

39:09.209 --> 39:10.276
look, the idea of splitting up

39:10.310 --> 39:11.978
is unmentionable for both of us.

39:12.012 --> 39:13.780
That's why
we don't mention it.

39:17.083 --> 39:19.219
But, Bobby,
other than our son,

39:21.655 --> 39:23.890
it is so dead in this home

39:25.759 --> 39:27.561
and has been for a while.

39:30.831 --> 39:32.232
DONNELL: Look,

39:32.866 --> 39:34.134
passion,

39:35.268 --> 39:36.803
that stuff,

39:40.907 --> 39:43.409
it wanes in marriage,

39:45.111 --> 39:48.749
especially when you have
young children.

39:50.684 --> 39:53.286
Things...

39:53.319 --> 39:55.021
ebb and flow.

40:00.634 --> 40:02.102
And...

40:06.139 --> 40:08.241
I'm very...

40:10.210 --> 40:12.112
in love with you.

40:24.525 --> 40:26.392
Do you--

40:26.426 --> 40:29.195
do you always feel like
you're in love with me?

40:34.535 --> 40:35.636
No.

40:41.041 --> 40:42.475
Do you ever?

40:46.346 --> 40:47.881
Not lately.

40:52.819 --> 40:54.254
Bobby,

40:54.287 --> 40:57.190
I don't think I was...

40:57.223 --> 40:58.424
aware of it at the time,

40:58.458 --> 41:00.433
but when I started
my own firm,

41:05.906 --> 41:08.108
I think I was beginning
a process.

41:10.143 --> 41:11.344
Process?

41:13.146 --> 41:14.881
Of leaving you.

41:20.887 --> 41:22.122
MARY: Wrote that great book

41:22.155 --> 41:23.123
"Don't be embarrassed

41:23.156 --> 41:25.091
about s-e-x."

41:25.125 --> 41:27.193
(laughter)

41:27.227 --> 41:28.995
But he backed out.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.597
He decided at the last minute

41:30.631 --> 41:32.298
he was uncomfortable
with women.

41:32.332 --> 41:33.066
(laughs)

41:33.099 --> 41:34.500
(door bell dings)

41:34.535 --> 41:35.969
MARY (over TV):
Well, you know, I don't know.

41:36.002 --> 41:37.604
Ted's not very good
at that sort of thing.

41:37.638 --> 41:39.740
WOMAN (over TV): But, Mary,
it's just talking.

41:39.773 --> 41:41.074
MARY (over TV): Yeah, well,
it's just talking

41:41.107 --> 41:42.843
that Ted's not very good at.

41:42.876 --> 41:45.278
WOMAN (over TV): Mary,
if I were in your position,

41:45.311 --> 41:47.714
you know that I would do
anything I could

41:47.748 --> 41:48.481
to help me.

41:57.423 --> 41:58.759
Can I help you?

41:59.593 --> 42:00.534
Special delivery

42:00.567 --> 42:03.537
for Russell Bakey.

42:05.271 --> 42:08.208
(music playing)

42:32.432 --> 42:33.800
YOUNG: Next on The Practice.

42:33.834 --> 42:35.869
Your best chance
at seeing freedom again

42:35.902 --> 42:36.970
is insanity.

42:37.003 --> 42:38.872
MAN: What she did
and what they can prove

42:38.905 --> 42:40.541
are two very different things.

42:40.574 --> 42:43.043
Your husband received money
as part of a family trust,

42:43.076 --> 42:44.545
and upon his death,

42:44.578 --> 42:46.813
that money will go to Kevin.
WOMAN: Yes.

42:46.847 --> 42:48.715
WALSH: Would Nancy Healey
have known this?

42:48.749 --> 42:50.150
Why didn't you cross her better?

42:50.183 --> 42:51.384
You were mush.

42:51.417 --> 42:52.653
If I go away,

42:52.686 --> 42:54.521
who takes care of you?

42:57.223 --> 43:00.166
(music playing)

43:21.955 --> 43:22.889
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:24.791 --> 43:27.694
(music playing)
