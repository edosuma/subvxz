00:04.373 --> 00:10.028
Hey, honey, I came up with a cool way
to bring in tons of new customers.

00:10.029 --> 00:14.979
We're going to have a "guess how
many jellybeans in the jar" contest.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.793
You're really gonna give away a
year's worth of music lessons?

00:17.794 --> 00:20.422
Of course not. No one's
ever gonna be able

00:20.434 --> 00:23.073
to tell how many
jellybeans are in the jar.

00:23.074 --> 00:25.174
18,118!

00:26.051 --> 00:27.803
Yes.

00:27.804 --> 00:29.844
Oh no!

00:30.661 --> 00:32.203
Aw.

00:32.204 --> 00:33.468
What's with him?

00:33.469 --> 00:35.479
You just won a year's
worth of music lessons.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.712
- Ugh!
- And this jar of jellybeans.

00:37.713 --> 00:40.533
I won jellybeans?!

00:41.784 --> 00:44.452
Hey, Ally, wanna see the
coolest thing ever?

00:44.453 --> 00:47.488
I've already seen you drink
hot sauce through your nose.

00:47.489 --> 00:50.729
No, this is way cooler.

00:52.829 --> 00:55.422
No way! An ad for your album.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.765
It's being released by Starr
Records in two weeks.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.667
This is so awesome.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.230
Buckle up because
we're in for a ride.

01:02.231 --> 01:05.471
- What up?!
- What up?!

01:07.206 --> 01:10.291
Already buckled up. Avoid the
worst, put safety first.

01:10.292 --> 01:12.512
What up?!

01:14.516 --> 01:19.496
Guess who got a job at
Mailboxes and So Forth.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.336
Here, Ally, these are for you.

01:21.337 --> 01:24.759
Your dad's overdue phone bill,
your application to M.U.N.Y.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.761
And a letter from
your Aunt Sally.

01:26.762 --> 01:29.464
Good news, her rash is gone.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.170
You read our mail?

01:31.171 --> 01:34.172
You can't just go around
reading other people's mail.

01:34.173 --> 01:36.570
My boss never said anything.

01:36.571 --> 01:41.047
Then again, according to this letter from
his girlfriend, that's why she left him.

01:41.048 --> 01:43.957
He can't communicate.

01:43.958 --> 01:47.953
You got an application
letter from M.U.N.Y?

01:47.954 --> 01:51.552
Yeah, it's a music school,
but I'm not interested.

01:51.553 --> 01:54.100
Wait, I thought it was your dream
to go to that music school.

01:54.101 --> 01:56.087
Not any more. I gave up on it.

01:56.088 --> 01:59.142
Why? Because you tanked
your original audition,

01:59.143 --> 02:02.891
which gave you horrible stage fright, and
now you're too scared to ever audition

02:02.892 --> 02:07.152
again because you
could fail miserably?

02:07.409 --> 02:09.329
What?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.746
We're gonna help Ally
get into that school.

02:18.747 --> 02:21.408
I'm not letting her
give up on her dream.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.294
I wouldn't even be putting out
an album if it wasn't for her.

02:24.295 --> 02:27.822
And I wouldn't be managing a guy putting
out an album if it wasn't for her.

02:27.823 --> 02:33.723
And I wouldn't have just eaten 18,118
jellybeans if it wasn't for her.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.300
I probably would've.

02:41.687 --> 02:44.789
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:44.790 --> 02:47.924
<i>Because you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:47.925 --> 02:49.456
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:49.457 --> 02:51.075
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:51.076 --> 02:54.120
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

02:54.121 --> 02:57.179
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

02:57.180 --> 02:58.793
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:58.794 --> 03:01.116
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:01.117 --> 03:05.254
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:05.255 --> 03:08.290
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:08.291 --> 03:11.360
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:11.361 --> 03:14.683
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:14.684 --> 03:17.333
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:17.334 --> 03:20.711
<i>Because I got you with me.</i>

03:20.712 --> 03:23.829
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:23.830 --> 03:28.150
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:34.124 --> 03:37.647
- When's Ally's birthday again?
- February something.

03:37.648 --> 03:40.450
"February something."

03:40.451 --> 03:42.818
Okay, what's her place of birth?

03:42.819 --> 03:45.159
A hospital.

03:45.402 --> 03:47.557
"Hospital."

03:47.558 --> 03:49.347
What are you guys doing?

03:49.348 --> 03:51.594
Filling out Ally's application
for music school.

03:51.595 --> 03:53.596
Let me see that.

03:53.597 --> 03:55.587
"Pickles" isn't a hobby..

03:55.588 --> 03:59.077
And I'm pretty sure her favorite
subject isn't "smart stuff."

03:59.078 --> 04:01.958
- Ugh!
- Told you.

04:02.174 --> 04:04.158
It's "lame stuff," right?

04:04.159 --> 04:06.326
You can't send this mess in.

04:06.327 --> 04:09.296
I'll apply for her online later.

04:09.297 --> 04:13.244
You realize Ally still has to
audition, and she has stage fright.

04:13.245 --> 04:15.966
You geniuses have a plan?

04:15.967 --> 04:18.035
Yeah, we have a plan.

04:18.036 --> 04:20.523
You geniuses don't have a plan.

04:20.524 --> 04:23.491
You know, she keeps calling us
geniuses but something about her tone,

04:23.492 --> 04:26.806
leads me to believe that she
doesn't think we're geniuses.

04:26.807 --> 04:31.461
Hey, it says you can audition
live over the Internet.

04:31.462 --> 04:33.504
I think I know a way
we can do this.

04:33.505 --> 04:35.619
Dez gets free music
lessons, right?

04:35.620 --> 04:36.628
Yeah.

04:36.629 --> 04:39.438
We can record Ally giving
Dez a piano lesson,

04:39.439 --> 04:42.860
then edit the footage to make it seem
like she's doing a live audition.

04:42.861 --> 04:45.029
Yeah, that was our plan too.

04:45.030 --> 04:47.131
But I don't wanna
take piano lessons.

04:47.132 --> 04:49.449
I had my heart set on bagpipes.

04:49.450 --> 04:51.417
It's gotta be the piano.

04:51.418 --> 04:57.318
Fine, but I'm gonna look totally
ridiculous playing the piano in this.

05:02.914 --> 05:05.769
We just need to record Ally
playing some great piano,

05:05.770 --> 05:08.491
so it seems live when we play
it during her online audition.

05:08.492 --> 05:11.513
That's easy, but what if she
has to answer questions?

05:11.514 --> 05:15.000
As long as we get her saying simple things
like "yes," "no," or "nice to meet you,"

05:15.001 --> 05:18.095
we can edit it to make it seem like
she's having a real conversation.

05:18.096 --> 05:20.327
Hey, everybody.

05:20.328 --> 05:23.330
Hey, Ally, do you mind if
I record my first lesson?

05:23.331 --> 05:25.373
I don't care. Go ahead.

05:25.374 --> 05:29.036
Can you give us a more specific answer?
Yes or no?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.732
- Yes.
- I got this.

05:31.733 --> 05:34.770
Hey, Ally, would you
teach me how to kiss?

05:34.771 --> 05:36.571
No!

05:38.500 --> 05:41.420
Now we just need to get her
to say "nice to meet you."

05:41.421 --> 05:44.989
Hey, Ally, how do you
like my new shoes?

05:44.990 --> 05:47.485
- They're nice.
- Nice! Um..

05:47.486 --> 05:50.152
- What's one plus one?
- Two.

05:50.153 --> 05:53.353
Oh, I forgot.. What is it
that vegetarians don't eat?

05:53.354 --> 05:54.976
Meat.

05:54.977 --> 05:57.732
- What's the opposite of "me"?
- Smart.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.004
No, the other opposite of me?

06:00.005 --> 06:02.186
- You.
- Yes!

06:02.187 --> 06:05.075
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

06:05.076 --> 06:06.740
You're being weird.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.124
Can we start our lesson now?
Have a seat, Dez.

06:09.125 --> 06:14.050
You know, I think I can learn much better
from back there, behind the camera.

06:14.051 --> 06:19.155
You think it'll be easier to learn piano
by not actually sitting at the piano?

06:19.156 --> 06:21.210
Yes, Ally.

06:21.211 --> 06:23.159
Yes, I do.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.798
Hey, Dez, wouldn't rather
have Austin give you lessons?

06:26.799 --> 06:30.450
Yeah, I'm a much better
piano player than Ally.

06:30.451 --> 06:34.336
What? I'm a much better
piano player than you.

06:34.337 --> 06:37.217
Can you play this?

06:39.000 --> 06:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:50.686 --> 06:55.546
Shall we get Ally ready
for her big audition?

06:57.825 --> 07:00.585
Time to call in.

07:02.298 --> 07:04.299
Greetings, Miss Dawson.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.536
Are you ready for your audition?

07:07.537 --> 07:09.361
Yes.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.721
Yes!

07:10.722 --> 07:12.838
You seem a little
unsure of yourself,

07:12.839 --> 07:16.478
but after that last embarrassment you
called an audition, I can see why.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.713
I never thought I'd
see you again.

07:18.714 --> 07:20.350
Nice..

07:20.351 --> 07:23.051
To.. Meet.. You.

07:24.114 --> 07:26.714
You know we've met before.

07:26.715 --> 07:28.575
No..

07:29.093 --> 07:30.111
Yes.

07:30.112 --> 07:31.024
No..

07:31.025 --> 07:32.327
Yes..

07:32.328 --> 07:35.797
No no no no no n-n-n-no.

07:35.798 --> 07:38.733
You're being weird.

07:38.734 --> 07:41.570
What makes you think you
can talk to me like that?

07:41.571 --> 07:44.472
I'm a much better piano
player than you.

07:44.473 --> 07:48.810
Well, you've certainly gotten very
modest since the last time we met.

07:48.811 --> 07:54.711
Well, go ahead. Why don't you show me how
much better a piano player you are than me?

08:09.218 --> 08:12.938
It's working! He's loving it.

08:23.098 --> 08:27.616
Only five minutes to go until the Austin
Moon album is officially on sale.

08:27.617 --> 08:30.352
Aw, I can't believe this
day is finally here.

08:30.353 --> 08:32.386
Thank you so much, Mr. Starr.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.936
Hey, thank me. I'm your manager.

08:34.937 --> 08:37.519
I should get at least
half the credit.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.280
You wanna pay half the hundred
grand I put into this album?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.796
You can give him all the credit.

08:42.797 --> 08:45.748
You all deserve half.
Jimmy deserves half.

08:45.749 --> 08:47.673
Ally definitely deserves half.

08:47.674 --> 08:51.299
Trish deserves half and
Dez deserves half.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.409
That is way too many halves.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.264
Anyway, you guys
are a great team.

08:56.265 --> 08:59.614
And I will see you all tomorrow
night at the album release party.

08:59.615 --> 09:02.751
- All right, bye.
- See you later. Goodbye.

09:02.752 --> 09:05.732
I am really proud of you, honey.

09:05.733 --> 09:08.456
Thanks, Mr. Dawson.

09:08.457 --> 09:10.492
I was talking to my daughter.

09:10.493 --> 09:12.713
Oh right.

09:13.696 --> 09:16.331
This is the best day ever.

09:16.332 --> 09:18.285
Well, it's about to get better.

09:18.286 --> 09:21.139
I happen to have a letter
here for Miss Ally Dawson.

09:21.140 --> 09:25.373
I've already read it, and I think
you're gonna be pretty pleased.

09:25.374 --> 09:28.614
This is from M.U.N.Y.

09:29.779 --> 09:33.144
I've been accepted
to the music school.

09:33.145 --> 09:35.780
They're offering me
a full scholarship?

09:35.781 --> 09:38.361
Congratulations!

09:38.421 --> 09:41.323
But how? I didn't even apply.

09:41.324 --> 09:43.680
Well, we kind of
applied for you.

09:43.681 --> 09:48.001
Then we used footage from Dez's
piano lesson for your audition.

09:48.002 --> 09:51.466
This is amazing. I can't believe
you guys did that for me.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.702
Hey, look how much
you do for us.

09:53.703 --> 09:57.706
None this would be
happening without you.

09:57.707 --> 10:00.575
This is so incredible, honey.

10:00.576 --> 10:04.416
I'm not falling for that again.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.716
This really is the
best day ever.

10:07.717 --> 10:09.628
Austin's album's coming out,

10:09.629 --> 10:13.083
and Ally just got accepted to
the best music school in Miami.

10:13.084 --> 10:14.944
Woo!

10:18.139 --> 10:20.147
They think M.U.N.Y..

10:20.148 --> 10:22.505
"Music University of New York"..

10:22.506 --> 10:24.966
Is in Miami?

10:25.568 --> 10:28.881
I wanna go to that school, but..

10:28.882 --> 10:31.740
I don't wanna leave my friends.

10:31.741 --> 10:33.708
Maybe I shouldn't go.

10:33.709 --> 10:37.646
Honey, it's the best music
school in the country.

10:37.647 --> 10:41.065
You can't just pass up
this kind of opportunity.

10:41.066 --> 10:43.166
I know.

10:43.170 --> 10:46.110
You're right, but..

10:47.142 --> 10:52.028
How am I gonna tell them
I'm moving to New York?

10:52.029 --> 10:54.648
Hi, could make this
one out to Dez?

10:54.649 --> 10:57.708
And then can you make this one out to Dez?
And this one out to Dez?

10:57.709 --> 11:00.040
And this one out to Dez?
And this one out to Dez?

11:00.041 --> 11:02.355
And this one out to Dez?
And this one out to Dez?

11:02.356 --> 11:05.716
And this one out to Dez?

11:13.759 --> 11:16.279
How was that?

11:16.390 --> 11:17.951
Perfect.

11:17.952 --> 11:20.867
What's wrong, Ally?

11:20.868 --> 11:24.533
I have to tell my friends something
and I don't know how to do it.

11:24.534 --> 11:28.159
Practice on me.
You'll feel better.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.080
Okay.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.477
Austin..

11:33.478 --> 11:34.903
Trish..

11:34.904 --> 11:36.776
Dez..

11:36.777 --> 11:40.544
I have to move to New York and I
won't see you guys for a long time.

11:40.545 --> 11:42.661
You're leaving?

11:42.662 --> 11:45.698
But you're my favorite
piano teacher.

11:45.699 --> 11:48.110
How could you do this to me?

11:48.111 --> 11:49.911
No!

11:54.297 --> 11:56.542
Well, that didn't
make me feel better.

11:56.543 --> 11:57.901
What's with Nelson?

11:57.902 --> 11:59.478
Uh..

11:59.479 --> 12:03.148
He's just doing his
vocal exercises.

12:03.149 --> 12:07.352
Listen, I need to talk to you
guys about the music school.

12:07.353 --> 12:09.354
You don't have to
keep thanking us.

12:09.355 --> 12:13.855
We'd do anything for you.
We're a team.

12:14.091 --> 12:15.644
Well..

12:15.645 --> 12:18.980
You know, sometimes
teams change.

12:18.981 --> 12:21.215
Yep, and ours is
changing for the better.

12:21.216 --> 12:25.504
Now that Austin's album is out, we
have a big, long future ahead of us.

12:25.505 --> 12:30.417
And that future could involve, oh, I
don't know, going to another city..

12:30.418 --> 12:34.547
Oh definitely! We're gonna be going to
lots of other cities when we go on tour.

12:34.548 --> 12:39.318
And the best part is the four of
us get to experience it together.

12:39.319 --> 12:42.571
- Actually, I have to..
- Come on, guys, hands in.

12:42.572 --> 12:44.917
On the count of three,
"together forever."

12:44.918 --> 12:48.105
- One, two, three.
- Together forever!

12:48.106 --> 12:50.463
- Forever.
- Woo!

12:50.464 --> 12:52.324
Woo.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.300
Hey, Ally, we got your text.
What's up?

13:00.301 --> 13:02.359
I just wrote a new song.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.960
I want you guys to hear it.

13:06.713 --> 13:11.684
<i>I'm leaving for school.</i>

13:11.685 --> 13:17.056
<i>I'm going far away.</i>

13:17.057 --> 13:20.316
<i>Your career's just
about to start.</i>

13:20.317 --> 13:26.438
<i>And I'm sad I have to depart.</i>

13:27.266 --> 13:30.446
Wow, kind of a downer.

13:31.404 --> 13:35.802
Can I be honest? Uh,
not your best work.

13:35.803 --> 13:37.462
Good thing you're not
going anywhere and

13:37.463 --> 13:41.156
we'll have plenty of
time to fix the lyrics.

13:41.157 --> 13:43.560
I don't think you guys
are really getting it.

13:43.561 --> 13:46.133
Austin, maybe you
should sing the rest.

13:46.134 --> 13:48.054
Okay.

13:51.625 --> 13:55.528
<i>Who knows how long I'll be gone?</i>

13:55.529 --> 14:01.734
<i>I'm so sad I can barely speak.</i>

14:01.735 --> 14:06.008
<i>I'm gonna miss you,
Austin, Dez and Trish.</i>

14:06.009 --> 14:11.184
<i>I'm leaving for New
York in a week.</i>

14:12.749 --> 14:16.342
This isn't really a
new song, is it?

14:16.343 --> 14:19.284
The music school's in New York.

14:19.285 --> 14:21.497
- I didn't know it was in New York.
- Neither did I.

14:21.498 --> 14:24.322
Guys, come on, "M.U.N.Y."?

14:24.323 --> 14:26.491
Music University of New York.

14:26.492 --> 14:30.212
- You knew?
- I'm not stupid.

14:30.374 --> 14:34.008
Ally, I can't believe you're gonna drive
to New York and back every day for school.

14:34.009 --> 14:37.249
That's like 1200 miles.

14:37.336 --> 14:40.539
No, Dez. She's
moving to New York.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.675
And driving back here every
day to hang out with us?

14:42.676 --> 14:44.536
Wow!

14:46.789 --> 14:48.891
This is really hard for me.

14:48.892 --> 14:51.059
I feel terrible.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.695
I feel terrible too.

14:53.696 --> 14:58.686
You're gonna call the school and let
them know you're not going, right?

14:58.687 --> 15:04.587
I'm gonna miss you guys too, but you
know I can't pass up this opportunity.

15:05.008 --> 15:07.910
We didn't know helping you
meant you were gonna leave.

15:07.911 --> 15:10.811
I can't just give up my dream.

15:10.812 --> 15:14.532
But it would nice if you did.

15:15.316 --> 15:18.166
Do you feel this
way too, Austin?

15:18.167 --> 15:21.723
I just can't believe
you're really going.

15:21.724 --> 15:26.164
Our music career is
just getting started.

15:26.930 --> 15:32.450
Don't you guys understand how
important this is to me?

15:46.878 --> 15:49.780
Is this really the
end of team Austin?

15:49.781 --> 15:52.583
Ally's really going
away to that school.

15:52.584 --> 15:57.765
After all the things we've done for
her, like getting her into that school.

15:57.766 --> 16:01.792
Guys, we have to put
ourselves in Ally's shoes.

16:01.793 --> 16:04.885
I mean, she's probably
feeling betrayed because,

16:04.886 --> 16:07.986
she has a shot at making
her dreams come true and..

16:07.987 --> 16:10.036
We're not being supportive.

16:10.037 --> 16:13.166
- She's the one who's leaving!
- I know, I know.

16:13.167 --> 16:15.987
You're mad, but..

16:16.642 --> 16:19.158
That's just misplaced
anger masking the hurt

16:19.159 --> 16:22.030
you're feeling over
losing your best friend.

16:22.031 --> 16:24.808
If we really care
about Ally Dawson..

16:24.809 --> 16:30.509
We need to put away those
feelings so that she can soar.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.049
Wow, Dez, that's great advice.

16:35.050 --> 16:36.794
Where'd you come up with that?

16:36.795 --> 16:41.415
I told you, I put
myself in Ally's shoes.

16:46.695 --> 16:48.465
I don't know how Ally
walks in these things.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.706
My feet are killing me.

17:03.068 --> 17:05.133
I wasn't sure if you
were gonna show up.

17:05.134 --> 17:07.415
As upset as I am
with my friends,

17:07.415 --> 17:10.761
this is still a special day for all of us.
I couldn't miss it.

17:10.762 --> 17:15.633
I'm just glad I get to hang out with my
little girl before she goes off to school.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.734
You sure you're okay
with me going, dad?

17:17.736 --> 17:21.455
Of course. I'm happy for you.

17:25.869 --> 17:30.190
What's up, everybody?
I'm Jimmy Starr.

17:30.782 --> 17:35.059
I wanna introduce you to my next
superstar whose album just dropped.

17:35.060 --> 17:38.600
Give it up for Austin Moon!

17:42.928 --> 17:45.796
Hey, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

17:45.797 --> 17:49.234
Tonight's supposed to be about
me, but it's also kind of a

17:49.235 --> 17:54.150
going-away party for my songwriter
and my best friend Ally.

17:54.151 --> 17:57.808
She just got accepted to a
really cool music school.

17:57.809 --> 18:03.709
Ally, me, Trish and Dez put this together
to give you something to remember us by.

18:08.507 --> 18:12.923
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

18:12.924 --> 18:15.374
<i>Do it without ya.</i>

18:15.375 --> 18:17.654
<i>Be here without ya.</i>

18:17.655 --> 18:22.233
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

18:22.234 --> 18:26.853
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

18:26.854 --> 18:30.922
<i>I own this dream.</i>

18:30.923 --> 18:35.743
<i>Because I got you with me.</i>

18:35.744 --> 18:40.428
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

18:40.429 --> 18:42.788
<i>Do it without ya.</i>

18:42.789 --> 18:48.192
<i>Be here without ya!</i>

18:53.798 --> 18:55.063
That was touching.

18:55.064 --> 18:57.734
Now can we get back to the record
release party I'm paying for?

18:57.735 --> 18:59.903
Wait wait wait.

18:59.904 --> 19:04.111
Ally, I'm sorry for the
way I behaved, but..

19:04.112 --> 19:07.052
I'm happy for you.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.040
And I'm really gonna miss you.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.170
And I'm sorry too.

19:12.171 --> 19:16.568
Dez made me realize that I was
just upset about you leaving.

19:16.569 --> 19:19.263
Dez made you realize something?

19:19.264 --> 19:21.498
I know, right?

19:21.499 --> 19:23.239
The point is..

19:23.240 --> 19:26.236
I was sad about losing
my best friend, but..

19:26.237 --> 19:28.666
I'm really excited for you.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.811
Wow, you guys are making
me do a "double take,"

19:31.812 --> 19:34.012
which is the second track
off of Austin's album,

19:34.013 --> 19:35.421
which is the reason
we're doing this..

19:35.422 --> 19:37.059
Wait!

19:37.060 --> 19:40.776
There's something I want to say.

19:40.777 --> 19:43.648
My dream has always been
to go to music school.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.816
Watching that video
made me realize..

19:46.817 --> 19:49.318
I'm living my dream
now because..

19:49.319 --> 19:51.689
I'm making music
with my friends.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.930
So what are you saying?

19:55.005 --> 19:56.694
I changed my mind.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.535
I'm staying here with you guys.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.482
- Group hug!
- Okay, come here.

20:07.817 --> 20:09.005
Um..

20:09.006 --> 20:11.083
Dez, that's the wrong group.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.304
Oh right.

20:17.782 --> 20:20.183
All right, let's get
this party started!

20:20.184 --> 20:21.852
Finally.

20:21.853 --> 20:25.573
This song is called "Illusion."

20:26.698 --> 20:28.874
<i>I'll be your entertainer.</i>

20:28.875 --> 20:30.993
<i>I'm putting on a show.</i>

20:30.994 --> 20:32.889
<i>I'm gonna levitate ya.</i>

20:32.890 --> 20:35.177
<i>Leave you wa-wa-wanting more.</i>

20:35.178 --> 20:37.386
<i>I see you're fascinated.</i>

20:37.387 --> 20:39.420
<i>I've got you hypnotized.</i>

20:39.421 --> 20:43.155
<i>White gloves, what you dream of.
A fantasy before your eyes.</i>

20:43.156 --> 20:45.349
<i>Step right up on the stage.</i>

20:45.350 --> 20:47.330
<i>Free yourself from the cage.</i>

20:47.331 --> 20:49.225
<i>Pick a card and guess it, girl.</i>

20:49.226 --> 20:51.563
<i>Here's a lesson, girl.
It's just an illusion.</i>

20:51.564 --> 20:53.571
<i>One, two, three, I disappear.</i>

20:53.572 --> 20:55.867
<i>I'm coming right back,
so stay right here.</i>

20:55.868 --> 20:57.619
<i>Ain't no second-guessing, girl.</i>

20:57.620 --> 20:59.654
<i>I'm impressing, girl.
It's just an illusion.</i>

20:59.655 --> 21:03.034
<i>Somewhere in a dream.</i>

21:03.035 --> 21:05.455
<i>We'll meet again, my baby.</i>

21:05.456 --> 21:08.873
<i>And I promise that
I won't disappear.</i>

21:08.874 --> 21:11.256
<i>I'll be right here.</i>

21:11.257 --> 21:15.260
<i>And I won't be,
won't be, won't be.</i>

21:15.261 --> 21:19.253
<i>Just an illusion..</i>

21:19.254 --> 21:20.588
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

21:20.589 --> 21:22.527
<i>Step right up on the stage.</i>

21:22.528 --> 21:24.877
<i>Free yourself from the cage.</i>

21:24.878 --> 21:26.575
<i>Pick a card and guess it, girl.</i>

21:26.576 --> 21:28.843
<i>Here's a lesson, girl.
It's just an illusion.</i>

21:28.844 --> 21:30.930
<i>One, two, three, I disappear.</i>

21:30.931 --> 21:33.128
<i>I'm coming right back,
so stay right here.</i>

21:33.129 --> 21:34.889
<i>Ain't no second-guessing, girl.</i>

21:34.890 --> 21:40.302
<i>I'm impressing, girl. But
I'm just an illusion.</i>

21:53.506 --> 21:56.176
You can make this one out to
Dez and this one out to Dez..

21:56.177 --> 21:58.995
All right, dude, I've signed
like a hundred of these.

21:58.996 --> 22:00.097
This is the last one.

22:00.098 --> 22:02.439
Is there anyone else you
wanna make it out to?

22:02.440 --> 22:03.961
Well..

22:03.962 --> 22:06.631
I do have a little Cousin
who just broke his arm.

22:06.632 --> 22:09.010
He could really use
some cheering up.

22:09.011 --> 22:10.696
Could you sign this CD for him?

22:10.697 --> 22:12.229
Of course. What's his name?

22:12.230 --> 22:14.090
Dez.

22:16.166 --> 22:19.983
Good news, Ally, I'm coming
to New York with you.

22:19.984 --> 22:22.624
Trish, mail me.

22:24.154 --> 22:27.541
That's sweet, Nelson,
but I'm not leaving.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.378
I'm staying here in Miami.

22:29.379 --> 22:32.200
And I don't work at Mailboxes
and So Forth any more.

22:32.201 --> 22:35.767
I got fired for reading
the mail and so forth.

22:35.768 --> 22:37.988
Aw nartz!

22:38.588 --> 22:44.408
Do you know how hard it was
to find an envelope this big?

22:46.552 --> 22:50.597
Well, Austin now that your album's
out, who knows what's going to happen?

22:50.598 --> 22:52.450
Concerts, videos, awards..

22:52.451 --> 22:54.676
Limo's, tours, money..

22:54.677 --> 22:57.500
Party's, after party's, after after
party's, after after after party's..

22:57.501 --> 23:00.664
Our lives could really change.

23:00.665 --> 23:03.024
We're going to be
living the dream.

23:03.025 --> 23:08.569
Honey uh, before you lock up could
you please clean the bathroom?

23:08.570 --> 23:12.170
Yup, we're living the dream.
