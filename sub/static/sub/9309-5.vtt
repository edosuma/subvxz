Close. Medi-peutic ...
it's a day spa.

01:46.775 --> 01:50.494
This treatment utilizes
high-frequency electropulse therapy.

01:50.529 --> 01:52.446

01:52.498 --> 01:54.498
Oh, you don't want to know how much.

01:54.533 --> 01:56.500
Mm. Give me a battery
and some jumper cables.

01:56.535 --> 01:58.168
I'll do it for ya.

01:58.203 --> 02:00.504
I have a gift certificate
for one treatment.

02:00.539 --> 02:03.290
One? 
Oh, how ever will you decide?

02:03.292 --> 02:06.043
I don't know.
 It's proving quite difficult.

02:06.095 --> 02:10.597
Oh! How about a reparative
oxygen and caviar plunge?

02:10.633 --> 02:13.350
It's fish eggs.

02:13.385 --> 02:15.018
Do you really need to know more?

02:15.054 --> 02:16.553
Okay, fine. There are
plenty of other options.

02:16.605 --> 02:19.022
I think you should come with me,
and we'll make a day of it.

02:19.058 --> 02:20.474
Mm-hmm. Can't wait!

Around 8:00 A.M. this morning,

04:49.541 --> 04:51.508
a neighbor noticed the

been waiting inside.

- All right, let's get her back.
- One moment.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.499
somewhere between midnight and 1:00 A.M.

06:06.535 --> 06:09.202
Cause appears to be blunt-force
trauma to the back of the head.

- The victim shows no ...
- "Susie."

06:11.256 --> 06:15.342

- Her name ... Susie.

06:17.713 --> 06:21.715

I see no apparent signs of a struggle,

06:21.767 --> 06:27.554
no signs of bruising,
or any other marks to Susie's body.

06:27.556 --> 06:30.223

never saw it coming.

Let's hope not.

06:43.822 --> 06:47.040
No forced entry, no signs of struggle,

06:47.075 --> 06:49.042
You think Susie knew her killer?
Maybe she let him in.

06:49.077 --> 06:50.744
Well, what the hell
were they looking for?

06:53.382 --> 06:55.916
Jane. You need to see this.

07:02.557 --> 07:05.642
- All of this was hidden in the wall?
- Yeah, along with this.

07:05.677 --> 07:09.312
- Shit!
- Little over 5 grand.

07:09.348 --> 07:13.066
- What was Susie doing with evidence?
- That's a good question.

07:15.437 --> 07:18.371
Wait. You're kidding me, right?

07:19.491 --> 07:21.602
There's no way Susie was dirty.

07:25.530 --> 07:30.367
I didn't know her for very long.
But she seemed...

07:30.419 --> 07:33.453
well, she... seemed very competent.

07:34.957 --> 07:37.674
She was ... exceedingly.

07:39.628 --> 07:42.963
In Afghanistan, I lost
a lot of colleagues.

07:42.965 --> 07:46.800
I'm sorry.

- No, seriously.

- If you have to ...
- I'm fine.

08:31.163 --> 08:32.846
Well, I talked to a couple of lab techs.

08:32.881 --> 08:34.648
They don't think she had a boyfriend.

08:34.683 --> 08:37.585
- They didn't know about any threats.
- And none of the neighbors

08:37.586 --> 08:40.621
reported anybody suspicious
hanging around over the last few days.

08:40.655 --> 08:42.839
No arguments, nothing
out of the ordinary.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.758
- Anything on the cellphone?
- Nothing that stands out.

08:44.810 --> 08:47.594
Friends and family mostly,
a few work-related calls.

08:47.646 --> 08:49.262
I also ran her bank records.

08:49.264 --> 08:51.515
No big purchases or unusual deposits.

08:51.567 --> 08:56.770
- So we got nothing.
- Except... this.

08:56.822 --> 09:00.774
It's hard to imagine Susie taking bribes
in exchange for altering evidence.

09:00.776 --> 09:02.826
If she was, maybe her
killer was searching

09:02.861 --> 09:04.828
for a piece of evidence she'd taken.

09:04.863 --> 09:07.164
Maybe they didn't want to pay a bribe.

09:07.199 --> 09:10.683
Maybe they were looking for
a more permanent solution.

09:12.371 --> 09:14.705
We need to match all these
to the cases they came from.

09:14.757 --> 09:16.623
That'd be like finding
a needle in a haystack.

09:16.625 --> 09:19.793
Hundreds of pieces of evidence
come through the crime lab every week.

09:19.795 --> 09:21.511
Then we need to talk to
the one person who knows

09:21.547 --> 09:24.214
what goes on down there
better than anyone.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.384
That's ridiculous!

09:27.436 --> 09:29.803
At this point, it's just
one avenue of investigation.

09:29.805 --> 09:31.388
Well, it's a waste of time.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.473
Susie Chang was one of
the most principled people

09:33.525 --> 09:36.526
I've ever known.
She would never tamper with evidence.

09:38.397 --> 09:40.397
Maybe you could just take
a look at the stuff we found,

09:40.449 --> 09:42.595
see if you recognize any of it.

09:49.541 --> 09:51.324
Without labels, it's impossible to say.

09:51.326 --> 09:52.793
These could've come from anywhere.

09:52.828 --> 09:56.211
But they didn't. They came
from Susie's apartment.

10:07.509 --> 10:13.430
Okay... I will have the lab
test them for DNA or prints.

10:13.766 --> 10:16.516
Maybe we can find a
match to an existing case.

10:16.568 --> 10:19.736
- Thank you.
- Could you also give us a list of cases

10:19.772 --> 10:22.022
- Susie worked in recent weeks?
- Of course.

10:23.025 --> 10:25.028
But first, I need to
call Governor Holcomb.

10:26.412 --> 10:29.663
- What for?
- Because this changes everything.

10:29.698 --> 10:31.415
I mean, even a hint

10:31.450 --> 10:33.450
that a senior criminalist in
the Medical Examiner's office

10:33.502 --> 10:35.452

evidence is incendiary.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.037

10:37.089 --> 10:38.538
The press isn't gonna
find out about it ...

10:38.590 --> 10:40.040
not until we have proof.

10:40.042 --> 10:42.709
A scandal like this could
jeopardize every case

lab over the last few years ...

10:44.763 --> 10:48.652
- potentially thousands of cases.
- She's right.

10:52.938 --> 10:55.555
Maura, come on.
At least give us a couple of days.

10:55.557 --> 10:58.608
I cannot risk the Governor
hearing this from anybody else.

10:58.644 --> 11:03.027
<i>Yes, uh, Governor Holcomb, please.
This is Dr. Maura Isles.</i>

11:03.062 --> 11:05.981
It's important. I'll hold.

[elevator bell dings]

11:33.479 --> 11:35.582

Want to ride out together?

11:35.583 --> 11:37.931
- Yeah. Sure.
- What address?

11:37.933 --> 11:39.900
Susie was working a crime
scene the night she was killed.

11:39.935 --> 11:41.401
We're gonna check it out.

11:41.436 --> 11:42.769
Nina and I will go over
Susie's recent cases,

11:42.771 --> 11:45.689
- see if anything jumps out.
- Okay.

11:48.410 --> 11:50.911
The right is from cash
found at the crime scene.

11:50.946 --> 11:53.864
The left from senior criminalist
Chang's personnel file.

11:53.916 --> 11:57.033
- An exact match.
- Hardly surprised, though.

11:57.085 --> 11:59.035
I mean, it was found
in her apartment, right?

11:59.087 --> 12:00.871
Yes, but I was hoping this would prove

12:00.923 --> 12:05.842
- that somebody else put it there.
- Whoever ... Whoever...

12:05.878 --> 12:08.595
killed her could easily have
put her prints onto the cash.

12:08.630 --> 12:09.963
Of course.

12:10.015 --> 12:12.349
But conjecture won't help us.
We need proof.

12:12.384 --> 12:14.634
And until we have it, we
have to be very careful.

12:14.636 --> 12:17.470
The Medical Examiner's office
is gonna be under a microscope.

12:17.523 --> 12:19.055
How can I help?

12:21.977 --> 12:24.584
I need you to take the lead on this.

12:25.063 --> 12:28.865
Everything has to be transparent.
All procedures and tests

12:28.901 --> 12:30.817
according to the strictest guidelines.

12:30.819 --> 12:34.654
I was Susie's direct supervisor,
so we have to avoid any suggestion

12:34.656 --> 12:37.457
that I am trying to affect the
outcome of this investigation.

12:37.492 --> 12:42.579
- What if you don't like what I find?
- Just find the truth.

12:42.631 --> 12:46.012
I am confident that that
will exonerate Susie.

12:49.671 --> 12:51.638
So, Susie's last case was a homicide.

12:51.673 --> 12:54.674
The vic was stabbed and bled out
before the paramedics arrived.

12:54.676 --> 12:56.593
The body was over by that dumpster.

13:00.015 --> 13:03.767
What are we doing here?
Susie was killed 6 miles from this place.

13:06.688 --> 13:09.739
Susie died one hour after
she left this crime scene.

13:09.775 --> 13:11.491
That gives her just enough time

13:11.526 --> 13:14.477
to drop the evidence off
at BPD and then drive home.

13:14.830 --> 13:15.996
You think she was followed?

13:18.617 --> 13:21.868
Well... even if she was
guilty, Susie was smart.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.870
She wouldn't want a criminal
to know where she lived.

13:23.922 --> 13:28.041
I mean, she had to have
been followed from somewhere.

13:28.043 --> 13:29.960
But there was no sign of forced entry.

13:30.012 --> 13:32.512
<i>A-And she never would've let
someone in she didn't trust.</i>

13:32.547 --> 13:37.217
No. And there was no record
of a call to set up a meeting.

13:37.219 --> 13:40.536
Well, unless she had a burner
and they took that, too.

13:44.643 --> 13:47.110
Janie, I-I don't want to
believe that she was crooked.

13:47.145 --> 13:50.897
Nobody does.
We don't have all the facts yet.

13:50.949 --> 13:52.949
I know, but how many times

13:52.985 --> 13:55.869
have we seen good people do bad things?

 You can clear this up.

14:17.509 --> 14:19.259
You know Susie didn't do those things.

14:19.261 --> 14:20.927
It's complicated, Ma.

14:20.979 --> 14:22.929
You worked right next to her every day.

14:22.931 --> 14:24.764
Don't you think you would've known?

14:24.816 --> 14:27.484
- I do.
- Of course you would've.

14:27.519 --> 14:28.985
She was your friend.

14:29.021 --> 14:31.604
There's lots of stuff we
don't know about our friends.

14:31.606 --> 14:33.189
Even you?

14:33.241 --> 14:35.575
There's a couple things
you don't know about me.

14:35.610 --> 14:38.745
Well, I could tell you a few things.

14:38.780 --> 14:41.614
Yes, and I could tell you a
few things about this one, too.

14:41.667 --> 14:44.560
It's not possible
that we could've been so

14:44.561 --> 14:46.002
wrong about Susie, is it?

14:46.038 --> 14:49.122
Look, you two haven't
had time to grieve.

14:49.174 --> 14:51.174
Instead, you've been working this case.

14:51.209 --> 14:53.694
You should be thinking
about all the things you

14:53.695 --> 14:56.179
did know about her, like
what was her favorite food?

14:56.214 --> 14:57.964
Mint chocolate chip ice cream.

14:57.966 --> 15:01.051
- She kept a pint in the lab freezer.
- Ew.

15:01.103 --> 15:04.888
Ice cream and lab tissues do not mix.

15:04.940 --> 15:08.942
- Well, did she have a pet?
- Fluffy ... lizard.

15:08.977 --> 15:12.696
Fluffy passed away two months ago.
Don't ask.

15:12.731 --> 15:14.280
Well, what did she prefer...
socks or no socks?

15:14.316 --> 15:18.151
- Who cares?
- Exactly. You can know someone

15:18.203 --> 15:21.571
without knowing every
little detail about them.

15:21.623 --> 15:22.956
Did you trust her?

15:22.991 --> 15:24.991
- Definitely.
- Absolutely.

15:24.993 --> 15:27.210
[cellphone rings]

15:27.245 --> 15:31.081
It's Governor Holcomb.
[cellphone beeps]

15:31.133 --> 15:32.832
This is Maura Isles.

15:32.884 --> 15:35.835
Did you ever tell Maura
about the junior prom disaster

15:35.887 --> 15:39.806
- with Benji Schwartz?
- No.

15:39.841 --> 15:41.558
And you're not going to, either.

15:41.593 --> 15:47.180
And if you do, I'll tell her about
your New Year's Eve 1999 fiasco.

15:47.232 --> 15:49.015
[chuckles]
You wouldn't.

15:49.017 --> 15:50.683
- Yes, I would.
- No.

15:50.685 --> 15:52.185
I'd make stuff up, too.

15:52.237 --> 15:54.104
No, Governor, I completely understand.

15:54.156 --> 15:57.157
Okay.
Goodbye.

15:57.192 --> 15:58.858
What'd he want?

15:58.910 --> 16:02.829
The Governor is concerned
about the fallout

16:02.864 --> 16:05.615
from a scandal at the
Medical Examiner's office.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.283
<i>He's hoping to get ahead of it</i>

16:07.335 --> 16:09.869
before the media gets
ahold of the story.

16:09.871 --> 16:12.338
Therefore, effective immediately,

16:12.374 --> 16:16.202
I am suspended from duty.

16:28.325 --> 16:30.409
You gave a full report
of our investigation

16:30.411 --> 16:33.712
- to the Governor's office?
- Yeah.

16:33.748 --> 16:35.714
They requested it last
night, and I sent it over.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.667
Maura got suspended
because of that report.

16:38.719 --> 16:41.887
I was doing my job ...
by the book, as requested.

16:41.922 --> 16:43.806
Now, did you need something?

16:43.841 --> 16:46.809
Yeah, I needed the autopsy results,
and you haven't even started.

16:46.844 --> 16:48.477
So, what ... so Maura puts
you on an investigation,

16:48.512 --> 16:49.762
now you're out to get her job?

16:49.764 --> 16:52.898
That's brilliant, detective. 
You got me.

16:54.351 --> 16:56.602
- Here.
- What is that?

16:56.654 --> 16:58.737
The autopsy report that you requested.

17:02.777 --> 17:04.777
2:37 A.M.

17:04.829 --> 17:06.612
So, what? 
You were here all night?

17:06.614 --> 17:11.116
Yeah.
Plotting my overthrow of Dr. Isles.

17:11.167 --> 17:13.452
And going through the lab's recent cases

17:13.454 --> 17:16.588
to find if any of them are
missing any key evidence.

17:16.624 --> 17:18.290
What'd you find?

17:18.342 --> 17:20.626
Well, it's what I didn't
find that's interesting.

17:20.678 --> 17:23.212
Not one case ...
Susie's or otherwise ...

17:23.263 --> 17:25.513
in the last six months is
missing any of the evidence

17:25.549 --> 17:27.299
that you found in Susie's apartment.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.635
Well, then, where did it come from?

17:29.637 --> 17:31.887
I'm afraid that's your job, detective.

17:31.939 --> 17:34.773
Now, the autopsy did
confirm that Susie died

17:34.809 --> 17:37.643
from a massive blow to
the back of the head.

17:37.645 --> 17:40.229
Something ... Something heavy,

17:40.281 --> 17:42.948
like a-a metal pipe or a tire iron.

17:42.983 --> 17:45.701
I found some metal alloy
in the cranial avulsions ...

17:50.458 --> 17:55.911
- Um... I'm sorry.
- Just tell me.

17:55.963 --> 17:57.830
[sighs]

17:57.882 --> 18:00.749
I also found some odd
lividity patterns ...

18:00.801 --> 18:05.170
subtle fluctuations in
how the blood settled.

18:05.222 --> 18:07.506
I think the body may have
been compressed after death

18:07.508 --> 18:08.640
for approximately an hour.

18:08.676 --> 18:11.677
- Compressed how?
- Well, wrapped up ...

18:11.729 --> 18:14.730
in a-a tarp or plastic
sheet of some kind.

18:14.765 --> 18:16.849
Wait a minute. Are you saying
that you think the body was moved?

18:16.901 --> 18:19.434
Definite possibility.

18:21.322 --> 18:24.690
Okay.
Okay, this is good.

18:24.742 --> 18:26.566
Th... okay. 
Um...

18:26.601 --> 18:30.279
sorry about the whole
"you taking Maura's job" thing.

18:30.331 --> 18:32.831
I'm sorry ... what was that?
I couldn't quite hear you.

18:32.867 --> 18:35.066
Okay, you know what?

18:41.542 --> 18:44.543
So, if the killer
transported the body here,

18:44.545 --> 18:47.713
they could've planted the
cash and evidence we found.

18:47.715 --> 18:51.633
Yeah, but they'd have to get the body

18:51.685 --> 18:53.685
inside without any of
the neighbors noticing.

18:53.721 --> 18:57.723
Didn't you say that the garage
footage was really dark, right?

18:57.775 --> 19:01.393
- Yeah.
- All right.

19:03.864 --> 19:06.398
[cellphone ringing]

19:08.652 --> 19:09.701
[cellphone beeps]

19:09.737 --> 19:11.403
- Yeah?
- Hey.

19:11.455 --> 19:13.822
<i>What if Susie wasn't
actually driving her car?</i>

19:13.874 --> 19:15.991
You think she was moved
in her own vehicle?

19:16.043 --> 19:17.910
Well... [sighs]

19:17.912 --> 19:20.629
I mean, you can see a driver,
but you can't see who it is.

19:20.664 --> 19:22.631
Well, there's a back stairway down here.

19:22.666 --> 19:24.499
They could've taken her up that way.

19:24.552 --> 19:26.468
Around midnight, when none
of the neighbors would notice?

19:26.503 --> 19:29.504
Well, if you're right,
the killer would've left on foot.

19:29.557 --> 19:31.224
He would have wanted to ditch whatever

19:31.225 --> 19:32.891
he wrapped Susie in right away so close.

19:32.927 --> 19:35.644
<i>Okay, I'll have CSRU
come and process her car.</i>

19:35.679 --> 19:38.597
Yeah.
[vehicle approaches]

19:42.653 --> 19:45.404
Hey! Stop!
 Stop that truck!

19:48.442 --> 19:52.527
H-hey! Wait!
Boston police department!

19:52.580 --> 19:54.529
How many trucks are working this area?

19:54.582 --> 19:56.331
Three?

19:56.367 --> 19:57.950
Well, get on the radio,
tell them all to stop.

19:58.002 --> 20:00.452
This whole area is a crime scene now.

20:00.504 --> 20:04.456
Which one are you supposed to be ...
Starsky or Hutch?

20:12.546 --> 20:14.763
[sighs]

20:18.302 --> 20:19.601
[sighs]

20:19.637 --> 20:21.303
[cellphone vibrating]

20:26.477 --> 20:29.695
- Did you find something?
- No. But we're really close.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.647
- Maura, listen.
- No...

20:31.649 --> 20:32.981
You don't even know
what I'm gonna say yet.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.700
Jane, you're gonna ask
me to look at something

20:34.735 --> 20:36.702
to do with Susie's case, and I can't ...

20:36.737 --> 20:38.487
not until she's officially
cleared of any wrongdoing.

20:38.489 --> 20:40.706
Maura, you know this
suspension is ridiculous.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.407
<i>You don't think I want to help?</i>

20:42.460 --> 20:43.826
Jane, I can't risk it.

20:43.828 --> 20:45.961
The reputation of the
Medical Examiner's office

20:45.996 --> 20:49.548
- has to be above reproach.
- What are you doing,

20:49.583 --> 20:51.300
just sitting around
the house doing nothing?

20:51.335 --> 20:52.918
I am not sitting.

20:52.970 --> 20:56.472
<i>All right, well, find something
to do, okay? Stay busy.</i>

20:56.507 --> 20:58.557
You and I do not do well on the
sidelines. I'll call you later.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.843
Not until the Governor
lifts the suspension.

21:00.845 --> 21:01.894
<i>I know!</i>

21:01.929 --> 21:03.896
[cellphone beeps]
I know. God.

21:03.931 --> 21:08.016
Jane.
CSRU found a plastic tarp in a dumpster

21:08.018 --> 21:10.569
a couple of blocks
from Susie's apartment.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.404
Are they sure it's
connected to the case?

21:12.439 --> 21:15.491
There was dried blood and hair inside.
Kent's processing the DNA now.

21:15.526 --> 21:17.526
If Susie was transported
to the apartment,

21:17.528 --> 21:20.779
it probably means the whole
crime scene was staged.

21:20.831 --> 21:25.356
Somebody's going to a lot of trouble
to make Susie look dirty.

21:35.954 --> 21:38.989
The lab confirmed that the DNA
on the plastic tarp was a match.

21:39.041 --> 21:42.492
- Susie was definitely moved.
- I knew she wasn't dirty.

21:42.544 --> 21:43.827
Well, the killer wanted
everybody to think she was.

21:43.829 --> 21:46.379
We cross-indexed all Susie's cases

21:46.415 --> 21:48.882
with her e-mails, phone
calls, and lab requests

21:48.917 --> 21:51.334
and then narrowed it
down to all the ones

21:51.386 --> 21:53.303
<i>most likely to have been
involved with her murder.</i>

21:53.338 --> 21:54.838
All right, everybody grab a stack.

21:54.890 --> 21:57.273
We'll go through them individually.

22:00.679 --> 22:03.680
So, Kent discovered additional fibers
inside the plastic lining?

22:03.732 --> 22:05.482
A couple.

22:05.517 --> 22:07.684
And these chemicals that
Kent found on the fibers ...

22:07.686 --> 22:09.820
does he have any theories
on where they came from?

22:09.855 --> 22:13.690
- Well, he's working on it.
- I'll just... hang on to this for a while.

22:13.692 --> 22:16.443
You can't give it to Maura.
She asked us to stay away.

22:16.495 --> 22:19.613
- I know.
- Jane...

22:19.665 --> 22:23.933
I'm not going to give it to Maura.
I promise!

22:29.925 --> 22:31.925
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

22:36.798 --> 22:39.015
Maura?
[whirring continues]

22:39.051 --> 22:43.053
- M-Maura! Maura!
- Oh.

22:43.105 --> 22:44.354
[whirring stops]

22:44.389 --> 22:46.640
Honey, what's going on here?

22:46.692 --> 22:50.560
Oh, well, I am taking Jane's advice.
I'm keeping busy.

22:50.562 --> 22:52.863
I've been meaning to do
a deep cleaning for months.

22:52.898 --> 22:55.031
Oh, you're very thorough.
[chuckles]

22:56.735 --> 22:58.818
Did you hear the latest about Susie?

22:58.871 --> 23:01.555
- No.
- Yeah, Jane found proof that

23:01.556 --> 23:03.707
she didn't do anything illegal.
Susie's clear.

23:03.742 --> 23:06.710
- Ohh! I am so relieved.
-  Me too.

23:06.745 --> 23:09.412
So, now you can go back to work, right?

23:09.464 --> 23:11.047
Well, we're gonna have to wait

23:11.083 --> 23:13.466
for the Governor to lift the suspension.

23:13.502 --> 23:16.336
<i>We can't afford anyone
thinking that Susie's innocence</i>

23:16.388 --> 23:20.423
was somehow manufactured
in order to avoid a scandal.

23:20.475 --> 23:23.393
All right.
But, um... [clears throat]

23:23.428 --> 23:24.928
now that I'm here, maybe, um...

23:24.980 --> 23:28.315
- maybe you could help me with something?
- Mm-hmm.

23:28.350 --> 23:32.602
What do you think of, um...
yeah ...

23:32.654 --> 23:36.606
uh, pr-pro... pi... on... aldehyde?

23:37.943 --> 23:44.770
- I'm sorry?
- Or, uh, methylanth-th-thracenes?

23:44.783 --> 23:46.533
- Anything weird about those ...
- Jane sent you.

23:46.585 --> 23:51.121
Jane? 
No. She wouldn't do that.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.875
[sighs] Maybe you could
help me pick that up,

23:55.928 --> 23:58.361
and, um, I'll finish the vacuuming.

24:01.934 --> 24:05.435
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

24:10.642 --> 24:12.976
[papers rustling]

24:18.867 --> 24:21.651
- Trivalent chromium.
- [yelling] What?!

24:21.653 --> 24:24.988
- Angela, you have to tell Jane ...
- Wait, wait, wait!

24:24.990 --> 24:26.623
[whirring stops]
What?

24:26.658 --> 24:29.075
You have to tell Jane
to have the lab test

24:29.127 --> 24:32.162
the trivalent chromium
particles for azurite.

24:32.164 --> 24:34.164
Also, see if they can
detect heightened levels

24:34.166 --> 24:36.750
of alicyclic C10 hydrocarbons.

24:36.802 --> 24:39.803
Maybe you could just write that down?

24:49.064 --> 24:51.598
Hey.

24:51.650 --> 24:56.853
Um, I-I heard you were
a half-caff caramel macchiato man.

24:58.023 --> 24:59.856
You didn't spit in it, did you?

24:59.858 --> 25:02.442
Do I look like someone
that would be that immatu...

25:02.494 --> 25:04.175
Please don't answer that.

25:06.782 --> 25:09.699
Can you tell me about the fibers
you found on the plastic sheet?

25:09.701 --> 25:11.167
Pigskin.

25:11.203 --> 25:13.536
Due to the presence of
trivalent chromium particles,

25:13.538 --> 25:16.039
I would say it was
from a leather product.

25:16.091 --> 25:17.757
Well, Susie wasn't wearing leather.

25:17.793 --> 25:20.460
You think the fibers could've
transferred from her killer?

25:20.512 --> 25:22.045
Possibly.

25:22.047 --> 25:25.048
Pigskin is used to make
leather jackets and gloves.

25:25.050 --> 25:30.136
But I couldn't confirm it.
There were traces of smoke residue also.

25:31.523 --> 25:34.024
Could you, uh... 
run a couple of tests for me?

25:35.894 --> 25:41.898
- And what tests would these be?
- Uh, check them for...

25:43.068 --> 25:47.203
...azurite and...
alicyclic C10 hydrocarbons?

25:48.740 --> 25:51.491
- Why?
- 'Cause I said "please."

25:51.543 --> 25:56.129
- You do know you didn't say "please"?
- Please.

25:58.083 --> 26:01.718
- Fine.
- Thanks a lot.

26:01.753 --> 26:03.169
Just as a matter of curiosity,

26:03.221 --> 26:06.122
what does this murder
have to do with a painting?

26:06.725 --> 26:08.808
Who said anything about a painting?

26:08.844 --> 26:10.510
Well, azurite is primarily
used for blue pigment,

26:10.562 --> 26:13.063
and those hydrocarbons are
predominantly found in paint thinners.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.150
Did you say that you
found smoke residue?

26:17.185 --> 26:21.654
- It was in the report.
- I need you to run those tests now.

26:21.690 --> 26:24.908
Like, "now" now. Please.

26:24.943 --> 26:28.244
Here's something ... rape case
coming up for appeal next month.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.996
Susie just completed the report

26:30.031 --> 26:32.115
on new DNA evidence being
used by the prosecution.

26:32.167 --> 26:34.667
That's interesting. 
Let me see.

26:34.703 --> 26:36.202
Forget about all those.

26:36.254 --> 26:38.671
Where is Susie's file on the ...
the painting forger?

26:38.707 --> 26:40.123
- Charlie Ganz?
- Yes.

26:40.175 --> 26:41.708
Charlie Ganz murdered that art thief

26:41.760 --> 26:43.293
and then killed himself...
that case is closed.

26:43.295 --> 26:45.678
Not officially. Susie was
still making calls about it.

26:45.714 --> 26:47.297
I think she ordered some new tests, too.

26:47.299 --> 26:49.015
- Who did she call?
- Let me check.

26:50.302 --> 26:52.135
Kent found smoke
residue on those fibers,

26:52.187 --> 26:55.972
and they have the same
chemical components

26:56.024 --> 26:57.524
as this burned painting.

26:57.559 --> 26:59.642
- The Thomas Moran painting?
- Yes.

26:59.694 --> 27:01.753
But the forger is the
one who torched it right

27:01.754 --> 27:03.813
- before he killed himself.
- We thought he torched it.

27:03.815 --> 27:05.648
You think whoever burned that
painting also killed Susie?

27:05.700 --> 27:07.984
Yeah, and it wasn't Charlie Ganz,
'cause he was already dead.

27:08.036 --> 27:09.652
Susie made three calls about this case

27:09.704 --> 27:12.539
in the week before she died ...
the Huntington Museum,

27:12.574 --> 27:14.657
Mary Hope Langdon,
the owner of the painting,

27:14.709 --> 27:17.827
and a Dr. Kowalski at the
BCU art-history department.

27:17.879 --> 27:19.245
Okay, let's ... let's call all of them

27:19.297 --> 27:20.880
and see what she wanted to talk about.

27:20.916 --> 27:22.499
Susie was chasing a theory on this case.

27:22.551 --> 27:25.300
Yeah, and it's that theory
that got her killed.

27:31.496 --> 27:33.863
The forger and the thief were both dead.

27:33.915 --> 27:36.583
Everything wrapped up, neat and tidy.

27:36.618 --> 27:38.668
But actually, there was
a third person involved.

27:38.703 --> 27:42.789
I'll run all their known associates,
see if anybody pops up.

27:44.509 --> 27:47.677
That was Dr. Kowalski, the
art-history professor at BCU.

27:47.712 --> 27:49.629
He said Susie contacted
him because he specializes

27:49.631 --> 27:51.548
in the Hudson River School of painters.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.201
<i>She wanted to know what
kind of wood Moran used </i>

27:54.202 --> 27:57.441
to stretch his canvases, which
was mostly alder, but ...

27:59.224 --> 28:00.807
<i>Maura: Jane.</i>

28:00.859 --> 28:03.476
I brought dinner... like we planned.

28:03.528 --> 28:06.188
Right.

28:06.565 --> 28:09.148
Ooh! Ooh! You got any extra?
'Cause I'm starving.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.619
- Sorry. No. Jane.
- Right.

28:18.493 --> 28:20.209
I hope this is something good.

28:20.245 --> 28:23.713
I knew better than
anyone how Susie thought,

28:23.748 --> 28:25.498
how she processed things.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.835
So I downloaded all of her
work from the lab servers,

28:28.837 --> 28:30.803
trying to figure out what she was doing.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.590
- Nice.
- She was focused on the fire

28:33.642 --> 28:36.181
that destroyed the
Thomas Moran painting.

28:36.811 --> 28:39.563
- Focused how?
- She sent everything

28:39.564 --> 28:42.515
recovered at the scene
back for additional analysis ...

28:42.567 --> 28:45.018
the metal backing wire,
a small piece of the frame,

28:45.020 --> 28:47.687
- all of the ashes.
- Did she find anything?

28:47.689 --> 28:49.355
Traces of methylene chloride.

28:49.407 --> 28:51.691
- Which is...?
- Methylene chloride is used

28:51.693 --> 28:54.451
to strip the paint off of old canvases.

28:55.580 --> 28:58.247
Wait a minute.

28:58.283 --> 29:01.918
So... the painting in the
fireplace was stripped?

29:01.953 --> 29:05.519
By a chemical that's only been
around since the mid-1900s.

29:05.554 --> 29:09.542
- So the masterpiece in the fire...
- Is simply another forgery.

29:09.594 --> 29:12.962
Maybe it was a practice version
of the one we found in the museum.

29:13.014 --> 29:15.465
Well, then, everything
has been staged ...

29:15.517 --> 29:17.800
the burning of the painting,
Susie's death.

29:17.852 --> 29:19.352
What do you want to bet

29:19.387 --> 29:21.354
that Charlie Ganz's
suicide wasn't real, either?

29:21.389 --> 29:25.224
So somebody is tying up loose ends
with only one purpose in mind.

29:25.276 --> 29:26.526
Yeah, so that no one knows

29:26.561 --> 29:28.611
this $20 million painting still exists.

29:28.647 --> 29:31.447
Okay.
But how would the killer know

29:31.483 --> 29:33.399
that the M.E.'s office was
still investigating this?

29:33.401 --> 29:35.401
All of these files are confidential.

29:35.403 --> 29:39.238
- Susie made a few calls last week.
- So she may have tipped them off.

29:39.290 --> 29:43.209
Yeah. Our killer is probably
someone that she spoke to.

29:44.462 --> 29:46.496
Thank you, Maura.

30:07.986 --> 30:10.403
[vehicle approaches]

30:14.109 --> 30:16.109
[gearshift clicks]

30:18.663 --> 30:20.113
<i>Detectives Korsak and Rizzoli</i>

30:20.115 --> 30:21.864
to see Secretary and Mrs. Langdon.

30:21.916 --> 30:25.702
Hey, open the gate. 
BPD is here.

30:25.754 --> 30:27.787
Where did the wife's
family get all her money?

30:27.789 --> 30:31.424
- Her family invented clothespins.
- You're messing with me.

30:31.459 --> 30:33.662
What, you think they
invented themselves?

30:40.101 --> 30:42.051
Thank you, Sandra.

30:42.103 --> 30:45.555
I haven't talked to anyone
from the police department ...

30:45.607 --> 30:47.440
not since I spoke with the two of you.

30:47.475 --> 30:48.808
This would've been a woman

30:48.810 --> 30:51.110
from the Medical Examiner's
office ... Susie Chang.

30:51.146 --> 30:54.564
Her records show a two-minute call
to your number four days ago.

30:54.616 --> 30:57.450
Oh. 
This is the house line, not my cell.

30:57.485 --> 30:59.986
I didn't take this call. 
Did you?

31:00.038 --> 31:02.488
No. Anyone on the staff
could've answered that.

31:02.490 --> 31:04.824
I-I'm sorry. What exactly is it
that you're hoping to discover here?

31:04.826 --> 31:07.493
Well, we need to speak to
whoever took that phone call.

31:07.545 --> 31:08.544
Why?

31:09.831 --> 31:12.131
With all due respect, Secretary Langdon,

31:12.167 --> 31:13.666
we're investigating a
homicide, so right now,

31:13.701 --> 31:15.501
we're the ones asking the questions.

31:15.503 --> 31:17.503
This Susie Chang ...
she was the same woman

31:17.505 --> 31:21.841
- who was taking bribes, is she not?
- Actually, no. She wasn't.

31:21.843 --> 31:23.726
And that information
hasn't been made public,

31:23.762 --> 31:25.511
so how do you know about it?

31:25.513 --> 31:28.014
Governor Holcomb told me,
and, frankly, I was outraged,

31:28.016 --> 31:30.066
as every citizen in
Massachusetts should be.

31:30.101 --> 31:31.601
- Sam.
- No, Mary.

31:31.653 --> 31:33.853
This is exactly the kind of corruption
that we need to root out.

31:33.905 --> 31:35.438
It's about time

31:35.490 --> 31:36.739
somebody held these agencies
to a higher standard.

31:36.775 --> 31:38.858
Sam, please.
You're not on the campaign trail.

31:38.910 --> 31:40.743
<i>Thank god.</i>

31:40.779 --> 31:43.446
Detective, what do you need from us?

31:43.498 --> 31:45.915
We need to talk to everyone on staff
who might've answered that call.

31:45.950 --> 31:47.617
[cellphone vibrates]
Fine.

31:47.669 --> 31:49.869
Sandra, can you gather everyone, please?

31:49.871 --> 31:52.588
Can you excuse me? I need to take this.
[cellphone beeps]

31:52.624 --> 31:54.040
<i>Hey.</i>

31:54.042 --> 31:55.875
Jane, I just heard from
Agent Burns at the FBI.

31:55.877 --> 31:58.127
He says the guy who wanted
to purchase the Moran painting

31:58.179 --> 32:00.213
<i>got contacted about
buying it three days ago.</i>

32:00.265 --> 32:01.964
<i>Our killer's trying to unload it.</i>

32:02.016 --> 32:03.933
Did they get any
information on the seller?

32:03.968 --> 32:06.102
<i>No names, but the seller did
give the buyer a contact number.</i>

32:06.137 --> 32:07.937
<i>Nina: I ran the number.</i>

32:07.972 --> 32:10.640
It goes to a prepaid cellphone,
but it's not GPS-enabled.

32:10.692 --> 32:12.525
So they can't get a location on it.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.527
<i>Not exact, but there were a few pings</i>

32:14.562 --> 32:17.897
off cell towers around Boston,
so he's somewhere local.

32:17.899 --> 32:20.900
Frankie, do me a favor.
Call that number.

32:20.952 --> 32:23.069
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

32:28.243 --> 32:29.575
It's ringing.

32:29.627 --> 32:32.711
[cellphone ringing]

32:38.670 --> 32:41.003
[cellphone beeps]
I got him.

33:03.161 --> 33:06.375
Get on your knees!
Put your hands behind your head!

33:06.410 --> 33:08.247
Now!
[groans]

33:13.121 --> 33:15.439
I want a lawyer.

33:16.624 --> 33:17.957
[handcuffs click]

33:30.296 --> 33:33.764
- Doesn't look too shaken up, does he?
- Smug bastard.

33:33.799 --> 33:35.349
Turn off the cameras and give
me 10 minutes alone with him,

33:35.384 --> 33:38.886
- he'll be shaken up.
- [sighs] We'll get him.

33:38.938 --> 33:40.554
We don't have enough to put
him away, and he knows it.

33:40.606 --> 33:42.056
Nina's still digging.

33:42.108 --> 33:43.891
She found an offshore
account in his name.

33:43.893 --> 33:45.275
It's got 100 grand in it.

33:45.311 --> 33:46.977
You think he was paid
to steal the painting?

33:47.029 --> 33:49.422
I do.
Right now, all we've got is

33:49.423 --> 33:50.314
the cellphone he was carrying.

33:50.366 --> 33:52.116
It ties him to the buyer
but not the victims.

33:52.151 --> 33:54.318
<i>Man.</i>

33:54.370 --> 33:57.404
[cellphone vibrates]

33:57.456 --> 34:01.241
Frankie's back.
We'll get him.

34:01.293 --> 34:02.776
[door opens]

34:02.812 --> 34:05.512
Did you find anything
in Ainsley's apartment?

34:05.548 --> 34:07.948
Nothing ... no painting,
no pigskin gloves,

34:07.983 --> 34:10.250
no possible murder weapon.

34:10.286 --> 34:12.052
Found something interesting.

34:12.088 --> 34:13.554
Kirk Ainsley has worked for the Langdons

34:13.589 --> 34:15.505
for almost eight years, but in his 20s,

34:15.558 --> 34:19.092
he was an enlisted soldier in
the army, rising to sergeant.

34:19.094 --> 34:21.812
So he has the skills
to have pulled this off.

34:21.847 --> 34:23.263
But here's the interesting part.

34:23.315 --> 34:26.150
- Guess who his commanding officer was.
- [beep] Who?

34:26.185 --> 34:28.435
Captain Samuel Langdon.

34:28.437 --> 34:30.187
So he's used to taking
orders from Langdon.

34:30.239 --> 34:32.438
He owes him, too ... Langdon
pulled Ainsley to safety

34:32.491 --> 34:34.324
when an I.E.D. hit their squad in Iraq.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.444
- He saved Ainsley's life.
- But that still doesn't explain

34:37.446 --> 34:38.946
why Langdon would
steal his own painting.

34:38.998 --> 34:40.614
He's got plenty of money.

34:40.616 --> 34:42.533
No, no, no. He doesn't have
the money ... the wife does.

34:42.585 --> 34:45.619
Has Langdon filed papers to run
for next year's Governor's race?

34:47.123 --> 34:49.456
$20 million would make
a nice campaign war chest.

34:49.507 --> 34:50.924
And he could run the
money through a pac.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.042
No one would know where it came from.

34:52.094 --> 34:53.460
Langdon hasn't filed to run,

34:53.462 --> 34:55.129
but he did form an
exploratory committee.

34:55.181 --> 34:56.597
<i>So Langdon wants to be Governor,</i>

34:56.632 --> 34:58.098
but his rich wife
isn't thrilled about it.

34:58.134 --> 35:00.927
- Maybe she won't bankroll him.
- He recruits his old army buddy

35:00.928 --> 35:03.981
to help him steal a painting
his wife already owns.

35:04.306 --> 35:07.141
We need to have another conversation
with Secretary Langdon.

35:08.861 --> 35:10.944
Well, Mary Hope is usually
right about these things.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.196
[chuckles]

35:12.231 --> 35:13.480
Detective Rizzoli, I was just saying

35:13.532 --> 35:15.482
that I owe you two a huge apology.

35:15.534 --> 35:17.067
I'm afraid that I let my enthusiasm

35:17.119 --> 35:20.487
for improving our city
get the best of me.

35:20.539 --> 35:24.208
- Well, thank you very much.
- I apologize if I was out of line,

35:24.243 --> 35:27.377
and I want to help this investigation
in any way that I can.

35:27.413 --> 35:29.329
You can start by telling
us about Kirk Ainsley.

35:29.381 --> 35:31.548
Yes, particularly the
part about you being

35:31.584 --> 35:34.918
- his commanding officer in the army.
- Of course. Yeah.

35:34.970 --> 35:38.005
That's what makes this such a shock.

35:38.007 --> 35:40.633
I've known Kirk for years,
and I never, ever would've

35:40.634 --> 35:43.260
thought that he'd be capable
of doing something like this.

35:44.313 --> 35:47.097
- Except that ...
- Well, he may have murdered three people.

35:47.149 --> 35:49.437
You need to tell us whatever you know.

35:50.319 --> 35:52.352
Ainsley was a good soldier.

35:52.404 --> 35:57.107
But he came back from Iraq...
changed.

35:57.159 --> 35:58.692
Honestly, I've been worried
about his mental health

35:58.744 --> 36:02.029
- for a while now.
- Well, we can understand

36:02.081 --> 36:04.448
how this would be difficult for you.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.868
Why don't you, uh... 
Why don't you have a seat,

36:07.920 --> 36:09.670
uh, while Detective Korsak
takes your statement,

36:09.705 --> 36:13.111
- and I'll grab us some coffees.
- Thank you.

36:13.959 --> 36:17.294
- Oh, and, uh, detective?
- Yeah?

36:17.346 --> 36:21.215
- Cream, two sugars.
- Of course.

36:21.267 --> 36:22.349
[door opens]

36:22.384 --> 36:24.685
Get up. We're taking a walk.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.720
[handcuffs click] I'm not
saying a word without a lawyer.

36:26.722 --> 36:29.523
Good. All you got to do is listen.
Get up!

36:31.227 --> 36:33.060
I know that Langdon paid you off.

36:33.112 --> 36:34.394
And I'm sure he told you

36:34.396 --> 36:36.230
he would take care
of you no matter what,

36:36.282 --> 36:39.733
get you the best lawyer money
could buy. [handcuffs click]

36:39.735 --> 36:41.951
Where is this lawyer?

36:42.738 --> 36:46.240
Huh.
[door opens]

36:46.242 --> 36:49.743
Don't say a word.
Move.

36:49.745 --> 36:52.246
And over the last few years,

36:52.298 --> 36:54.998
Ainsley's become increasingly unhinged.

36:55.050 --> 36:58.669
And where was it, again, you said
he might've hidden some evidence?

36:58.721 --> 37:01.221
He has a small cabin
off upper Mystic Lake.

37:01.257 --> 37:02.973
<i>It's not registered in his name.</i>

37:03.008 --> 37:04.925
<i>I think it's on old Pine Ridge road.</i>

37:04.977 --> 37:07.394
- You son of a bitch.
- Ainsley?

37:07.429 --> 37:09.730
It was your idea, killing those
people and planting that evidence.

37:09.765 --> 37:12.099
- What? That's ... That's absurd.
- What do you want to know?

37:12.101 --> 37:13.600
I'll give you enough to put
this bastard away forever.

37:13.602 --> 37:16.103
- Clearly he's insane.
- Oh, you lying sack of shit!

37:16.105 --> 37:17.738
Hey, hey, hey!
All right, all right.

37:17.773 --> 37:19.439
All right, you want to do the honors?

37:19.491 --> 37:21.441
With pleasure. 
You have the right to remain silent.

37:21.493 --> 37:24.669
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

37:24.704 --> 37:25.529
- in a court of law.
- You are making a huge mistake.

37:25.581 --> 37:27.592
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>

37:46.802 --> 37:49.386
Ah. Dr. Isles.

37:49.438 --> 37:51.388
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.474
And thank you for stepping
up the last few days.

37:54.476 --> 37:56.026
Ah, I was just doing my job.

37:56.061 --> 37:58.729
I hear they've recovered
Mrs. Langdon's painting.

37:58.781 --> 38:01.674
Yes.
But I doubt that she will

38:01.675 --> 38:04.484
- ever look at it the same again.
- Mm.

38:06.155 --> 38:09.539
- Anyway, good night.
- Oh, Kent, uh, a few of us

38:09.575 --> 38:12.292
are going to the Dirty Robber
after work ...

38:12.328 --> 38:14.378
just a small celebration
of Susie's life.

38:14.413 --> 38:15.995
Why don't you come?

38:17.249 --> 38:18.665
Yeah.

38:18.667 --> 38:22.449
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Good.

38:36.518 --> 38:39.486
Kent?
I think this is yours.

38:39.521 --> 38:42.155
Ah. I was wondering where that got to.

38:42.191 --> 38:45.525
Thanks.
Uh, I'll see you shortly.

38:57.589 --> 38:59.206
[indistinct conversations]

38:59.258 --> 39:01.625
[glass clinking]

39:01.677 --> 39:02.709
[conversations stop]

39:09.051 --> 39:10.550
Thank you all for coming.

39:10.552 --> 39:15.272
We all know that Susie
loved a party. [laughter]

39:18.227 --> 39:20.394
I knew the moment that I met Susie

39:20.396 --> 39:24.231
that she was someone very special.

39:24.233 --> 39:26.483
The second week she was at the lab,

39:26.535 --> 39:30.153
we had a corpse arrive...
700 bee stings.

39:30.205 --> 39:34.124
Massive skin lesions,
acute inflammation ...

39:34.159 --> 39:36.376
[clears throat]

39:36.412 --> 39:39.796
the point is, the next morning,

39:39.832 --> 39:42.382
I came in to find Susie in the back,

39:42.418 --> 39:46.503
covered from head to toe
in a beekeeper's suit,

39:46.555 --> 39:49.639
running tests on four different hives.

39:52.678 --> 39:56.263
And I knew then 
that I had met a kindred spirit.

39:59.401 --> 40:01.568
[voice breaking] We will miss you.

40:01.603 --> 40:02.602
To Susie.

40:02.654 --> 40:03.896
<i>All: To Susie!</i>

40:06.575 --> 40:12.612
Uh, in honor of one of
our favorite science nerds,

40:12.664 --> 40:14.698
I asked Nina to find
something that Susie liked.

40:14.750 --> 40:18.668
- Were you able to find anything?
- This is Susie's iPod ...

40:18.704 --> 40:20.754
the one she listened to when
she was working in the lab.

40:20.789 --> 40:23.457
Isn't that against regulations?

40:23.509 --> 40:25.759
- Oh, have a drink.
- Shut up.

40:27.463 --> 40:29.262
Please continue.

40:29.298 --> 40:33.467
Well, there's one on
here she played 468 times.

40:33.519 --> 40:37.604
- Wow.
- Must've been a Brandenburg concerto.

40:37.639 --> 40:39.473
There's nothing better to work to.

40:39.475 --> 40:42.776
Or to fall asleep at your desk too.
[laughter]
