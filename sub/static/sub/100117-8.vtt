WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:03.655
Man: Is this John?

00:03.699 --> 00:04.830
John died.
Who is this?

00:04.874 --> 00:06.049
I-I'm his son.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.833
Dean: Adam was our brother.

00:07.877 --> 00:10.662
He died like a hunter.
He deserves to go out like one.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.664
Sam: Maybe we can bring him
back, get ahold of Cass,

00:12.708 --> 00:14.144
call in a favor.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.146
Adam: These angels tell me
that I'm chosen.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.583
Michael -- I'm his
sword or vessel.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.758
Hey, ass-butt!

00:22.196 --> 00:25.895
-We're brothers.
-God is doing this to us!

00:28.898 --> 00:32.032
Dean: God was
supposed to be gone.

00:32.075 --> 00:35.426
Sam: What if I'm
seeing Chuck's endings?

00:35.470 --> 00:37.515
-Aah!
-Eileen,

00:37.559 --> 00:38.951
we can bring you back.

00:38.995 --> 00:42.303
Sam:
Ex spiritu incarnatum est.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.873
Chuck is weak.
I think we can beat him.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.789
I can see it now --
"Supernatural: The End."

00:50.833 --> 00:52.878
It's God, Sam.
How the hell are we

00:52.922 --> 00:54.576
supposed to fight God?

00:57.927 --> 00:59.363

Sam!

03:21.375 --> 03:23.203
Hey!

03:25.553 --> 03:27.772
Were you tailing me?

03:27.816 --> 03:29.992
You could have
left a note.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.474
You're worried about me.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.827
You -- You think I'm being
overprotective?

03:39.741 --> 03:41.699
A little bit.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.061
I got it!

03:56.105 --> 04:00.979
The answer to all of our
problems...maybe.

04:01.023 --> 04:04.113
So, we know that
Chuck is weak, right?

04:04.156 --> 04:05.897
If we're to take our shot,
now's the time.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.465
But a weak God
is still God.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.728
So, how the hell are we
supposed to take him down?

04:10.772 --> 04:13.253
Well, I was
doing some thinking.

04:13.296 --> 04:17.082
What if the answer is right
under our noses?

04:17.126 --> 04:19.128
The demon tablet?

04:19.171 --> 04:20.869
Boom.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.829
This was dictated by
God Himself --

04:24.873 --> 04:28.572
instructions on how
to seal angels and demons

04:28.616 --> 04:30.182
back into heaven
and hell if --

04:30.226 --> 04:32.837
if they ever tried
to take over Earth.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.317
Exactly.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.928
But if Chuck was
so freaking invincible,

04:36.972 --> 04:38.495
then why wasn't he able
to protect us

04:38.539 --> 04:40.932
from the dick demons
or even the dickier angels?

04:40.976 --> 04:43.283
'Cause, remember,
these babies were dictated

04:43.326 --> 04:45.937
before he took a powder.

04:45.981 --> 04:49.767
So, he was worried
about humans,

04:49.811 --> 04:53.162
if he couldn't
protect them?

04:53.205 --> 04:54.816
Yeah.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.862
Like, if, for some reason,
he were out of commission.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.430
Which is weird,
considering that he's

05:00.474 --> 05:02.519
supposed to be
untouchable,

05:02.563 --> 05:05.130
unless he is not...
untouchable.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.786
So, he has
an Achilles heel.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.572
Well, I'm saying
he has a weak spot.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.010
Yeah, that's -- that's...

05:15.053 --> 05:16.838
These hunks of rock,
they're -- they're like a --

05:16.881 --> 05:19.057
they're like an advanced
directive, okay?

05:19.101 --> 05:20.885
In case something happens
to Chuck because there is

05:20.929 --> 05:23.671
a crack in his
invincibility shield.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.630
So, you guys
can read that?

05:26.674 --> 05:28.328
No.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.504
But I've got that handled.

05:33.942 --> 05:37.380
I know you're in there.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.568
Donatello,
would you please?

05:51.612 --> 05:54.049
Go away!

05:59.924 --> 06:01.839
I'm not sure
I'm ready for this.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.494
What you're trying to do, it --
it doesn't sound possible.

06:04.538 --> 06:07.018
Look, we know that
Chuck overpowered his sister,

06:07.062 --> 06:10.065
the Darkness,
and locked her up, so...

06:10.108 --> 06:12.284
We may be able to
lock him up, too.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.548
Why don't you
just kill him?

06:14.591 --> 06:18.900
God has to exist to maintain
the balance of the universe.

06:18.943 --> 06:21.206
Without him, creation
would fall apart.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.034
Right, so, the best thing
to do is toss him in

06:23.078 --> 06:24.558
solitary and throw away
the key.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.778
Okay,
but the last time,

06:27.822 --> 06:30.215
it took the power of God
to do this?

06:30.259 --> 06:33.305
I mean, even if he has
a hidden flaw,

06:33.349 --> 06:35.960
do you have
the power of God?

06:36.004 --> 06:38.136
You know what?
Uh, one step at a time.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.921
You figure out how
to lock him up,

06:39.964 --> 06:41.923
we'll take care
of the rest.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.883
Oh.

06:45.927 --> 06:51.889
And, guys,
when I go crazy again,

06:51.933 --> 06:55.110
just shoot me.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.123
Stop it.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.574
Oh.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.446
This is interesting.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.972
-What?
-What is it?

07:31.886 --> 07:36.499
There appear to be annotations,
uh, personal observations.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.631
By Metatron?

07:37.674 --> 07:39.459
By the scribe, yes.

07:39.502 --> 07:43.463
Uh, as if he were trying to give
some context to God's actions.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.942
For example?

07:44.986 --> 07:47.379
"The Almighty guards
his secret fear,

07:47.423 --> 07:49.599
but it is always there."

07:49.643 --> 07:50.818
Fear of what?

07:50.861 --> 07:53.124
"Fear of what,
I do not know.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.692
This he shares only
with his favorite."

07:55.736 --> 07:57.346
Favorite?

07:57.389 --> 08:00.305
Wait, his favorite...
at the time -- at the time

08:00.349 --> 08:02.307
this was written,
Lucifer had been cast down.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.309
Michael sealed him
in the Cage.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.137
So Michael
was the favorite.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.488
Oh, yeah,
a real daddy's boy.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.882
But if Michael
helped Chuck overpower Amara,

08:11.926 --> 08:14.624
then maybe he also knows
how to lock him up.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.409
Perhaps, but even
if we could get to him,

08:17.453 --> 08:18.889
he wouldn't tell us.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.152
I don't know.
But I mean, if my dad kept me

08:21.196 --> 08:23.328
locked up in a cage for
10 years, I might be looking

08:23.372 --> 08:24.504
to get some payback.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.722
It's worth a shot.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.071
Swell!

08:27.115 --> 08:28.508
So, you guys
talk to Michael.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.031
Problem solved, right?!

08:30.074 --> 08:31.554
Not exactly.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.903
Michael's in hell.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.079
Castiel: Yeah, he was
possessing Adam,

08:35.123 --> 08:38.343
Sam and Dean's half-brother,
when he fell into hell with Sam,

08:38.387 --> 08:39.736
who was possessed
by Lucifer,

08:39.780 --> 08:43.218
and then they were
all sealed in the Cage.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.872
What is it
with you people?!

08:44.915 --> 08:46.569
Can anything
you do be easy?!

08:46.613 --> 08:48.528
I mean...

08:54.055 --> 08:55.665
But where's
the fun in that?

08:57.145 --> 09:00.583
This story just gets
better and better.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.585
Donny, you going
crazy again?

09:02.629 --> 09:07.198
Oh, Donatello's
not here any longer.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.896
Hey, guys.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.769
It's Chuck.

09:14.510 --> 09:18.732
Prophets speak the word of God,
sometimes indirectly.

09:18.775 --> 09:22.213
Sometimes they're
my bluetooth.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.957
So, here's the thing.

09:27.001 --> 09:32.049
Usually, I really love
our little...process.

09:32.093 --> 09:35.705
I toss something at you guys,
and you slam it right back.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.577
It's fun, like tennis.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.317
With monsters.

09:39.361 --> 09:43.713
But this --
Let this one go.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.976
Or what?

09:46.020 --> 09:48.065
Or I go all-powerful.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.242
Maybe not on you.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.505
Not right away.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.247
But, let's see, there's...

09:56.291 --> 10:01.513
Jody, Donna, Eileen.

10:01.557 --> 10:04.081
Pretty much everybody
on your speed dial.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.083
So drop it.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.650
'Kay?

10:16.964 --> 10:19.357
Well, the bunker's
warding is intact,

10:19.401 --> 10:22.534
but it clearly doesn't
withstand God.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.275
How much do you
think he heard?

10:24.319 --> 10:27.278
He heard enough.

10:27.322 --> 10:32.675
So...
do we...drop it?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.111
Donnie, I think
it might be safer

10:34.155 --> 10:35.112
if you went on home.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.549
Really? I have to leave?

10:37.593 --> 10:38.812
Oh, that's too bad.
I'll, uh --

10:38.855 --> 10:40.857
I'll just get my stuff.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.820
Okay.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.473
Like hell we're
dropping this.

10:50.345 --> 10:53.304
Donna, Jody --
They're not safe.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.132
They'll never be safe.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.873
As long as Chuck is out there,
it's only a matter of time --

10:56.917 --> 10:58.396
Before he rounds
them up and offs them.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.963
Just to watch us
suffer.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.399
The only way to keep
them safe --

11:01.443 --> 11:04.315
to keep everyone safe --
is to take Chuck down.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.970
Which is exactly
what we're gonna do.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.712
Are we seriously
talking about going to hell

11:09.756 --> 11:11.409
to try to speak
to Michael?

11:11.453 --> 11:15.196
Michael, who is in
the Cage, and insane?

11:15.239 --> 11:16.501
Yeah, and who
told us that?

11:16.545 --> 11:17.851
Lucifer.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.374
And Chuck.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.550
Now, I trust them as far
as I can throw them.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.421
But, Cass,
if you wanna stay here,

11:23.465 --> 11:25.510
why don't you
stay here?

11:58.892 --> 12:01.459
Here. Allow me.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.599
Thanks.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.209
Well, I think
we're done.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.863
It's exactly
the spell Rowena used.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.431
Just...without Rowena.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.087
Alright, let's do 'er.

12:20.130 --> 12:24.569
"Initium ad inferna...

12:24.613 --> 12:26.093
permittatur."

12:54.948 --> 12:57.428
Now where?

12:57.472 --> 12:59.909
This way.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.314
Sam.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.317
Dean.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.584
Ladies.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.108
Look, we're not looking
for trouble, okay?

13:25.152 --> 13:26.675
We just wanna talk --

13:30.026 --> 13:31.854
Aah!

13:43.692 --> 13:45.955
Are any of us winning?!

14:05.018 --> 14:07.324
Woman: Stop!

14:22.600 --> 14:25.386
Hello, boys.

14:29.085 --> 14:32.741
You did say you wanted
to see the one in charge?

14:32.784 --> 14:34.874
Rowena, we thought
you were dead.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.746
Oh, I am, dear.
Pretty much everyone here is.

14:37.789 --> 14:40.357
When I closed the fissure,
it did cost me my life,

14:40.401 --> 14:43.012
and my soul went to hell.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.362
Big surprise.

14:45.406 --> 14:48.931
And the demons just...
handed you the throne?

14:48.975 --> 14:51.542
No one hands you
anything, darlin'.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.893
I took it.

14:55.590 --> 14:59.899
So, why are you here?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.292
Chuck.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.815
He back,
and he's outta control,

15:03.859 --> 15:05.295
and we need to
rein him in.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.385
You want
to rein in God.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.388
We think
there's a way.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.216
Listen, we just need to
speak to Michael.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.741
Michael, the out-of-his-head
archangel?

15:16.785 --> 15:19.962
This just gets better.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.660
Ahh.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.793
Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter.

15:24.836 --> 15:25.837
What?

15:25.881 --> 15:28.405
He won't be in the Cage.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.798
Every door here
was flung wide

15:29.841 --> 15:31.582
when Chuck opened
the fissure.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.455
Your archangel could
be anywhere in hell,

15:34.498 --> 15:37.414
or out of hell,
for that matter.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.155
Rowena, we're running
outta time, okay?

15:39.199 --> 15:41.462
We need
Michael yesterday.

15:46.554 --> 15:49.861
Did you not hear
the man?

15:51.385 --> 15:53.604
Find him!

16:16.845 --> 16:18.107
Eileen?

16:18.151 --> 16:20.022
Oh, my God!

16:20.066 --> 16:21.545
I didn't know
if you'd pick up.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.286
People are
saying you're...

16:23.330 --> 16:24.984
Dead?

16:25.027 --> 16:27.203
Yeah.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.379
Didn't take.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.815
Clearly.

16:30.859 --> 16:33.905
Uh, anyway, do you
remember --

16:33.949 --> 16:35.472
I'm Sue...Barrish.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.039
We worked that
ghoul case.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.519
Yeah, I remember.

16:38.562 --> 16:41.043
I'm, uh, following
this vamp's nest.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.132
They're migrating, looking for
decent feeding grounds,

16:43.176 --> 16:45.874
and, well,
when they get stopped,

16:45.917 --> 16:48.398
I'm gonna need help
cleaning them out.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.052
Where are they now?

16:50.096 --> 16:53.186
Moving down I-80,
towards Omaha.

16:53.229 --> 16:55.666
I'm close to there.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.756
So...you're in?

17:01.194 --> 17:03.674
I'm kinda in
the middle of something.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.546
But if I'm free...

17:05.589 --> 17:09.376
Cool!
Uh, I'll call you.

17:29.961 --> 17:30.962
Rowena, I...

17:31.006 --> 17:33.095
Samuel, please.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.184
You killing me
was one of the best things

17:35.228 --> 17:37.186
that ever happened.

17:37.230 --> 17:40.798
Yes, there are things
I miss about being alive.

17:40.842 --> 17:44.106
Flesh-on-flesh sex.

17:44.150 --> 17:48.067
Amazon doesn't deliver
here...yet.

17:48.110 --> 17:52.636
But, lads, I'm queen.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.899
My subjects revere me.

17:54.943 --> 17:58.077
Well, fear me,
which is better.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.428
I should have died
a long time ago.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.953
Samuel, be a dear.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.304
Yeah.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.753
What am I picking up
from you two?

18:22.797 --> 18:24.929
A wee tiff?

18:24.973 --> 18:27.410
Tell your Auntie Rowena.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.585
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.239
It's fine.

18:30.283 --> 18:33.242
Boys? Fix it.

18:33.286 --> 18:37.420
I don't have many regrets,
but the few I do still haunt me.

18:37.464 --> 18:41.294
Making Napoleon so short
was just bitchy.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.645
Telling Mick Jagger he had
no future when I dumped him.

18:44.688 --> 18:50.259
And, well, everything
with dear Fergus.

18:50.303 --> 18:53.306
Then one day, you die,
you go to hell,

18:53.349 --> 18:57.484
they make you queen, and...

18:57.527 --> 19:00.051
you can't make it right.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.144
So fix it!

19:11.759 --> 19:13.282
Thank you, my dove.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.718
Demon: Milady.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.287
Aye?

19:18.331 --> 19:22.030
Michael -- he's...

19:22.073 --> 19:24.380
nowhere to be found.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.642

20:28.662 --> 20:30.881
Uh, I don't know.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.448
My brothers are dead.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.146
My father
never returned.

20:35.190 --> 20:38.541
In so many ways,
I'm alone.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.761
Yeah. Same here.

20:40.804 --> 20:43.285
It's not like I have family
waiting to see me.

20:43.329 --> 20:46.854
You have the Winchesters,
your brothers.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.553
I met them once.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.556
And they let me
rot in hell.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.385
Family.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.518
Family sucks.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.566
Donnie, hey.
How you doing, pal?

21:03.610 --> 21:05.786
Listen, uh, we got ourselves
a little situation here.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.396
I thought I was
off the case.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.571
Off the case?
No, come on, pal.

21:08.615 --> 21:09.920
You're part of the team.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.749
Oh. Gratifying.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.186
Listen, have you, uh,
sensed anything lately?

21:15.230 --> 21:16.753
Uh, like...?

21:16.797 --> 21:19.103
Like a-a surge
of power?

21:19.147 --> 21:20.279
But not -- not God-like.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.932
But almost God-like.

21:21.976 --> 21:24.848
Uh, no,
I don't think so.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.111
Okay, well, we've kind of
got ourselves an emergency here,

21:27.155 --> 21:28.939
so, uh, if anything tickles
your brain,

21:28.983 --> 21:30.114
you let us know.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.420
Tickles my --Gotta go.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.339
Well, Donnie's got zip.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.341
What about you?

21:41.517 --> 21:44.607
Nothing that screams
"archangel."

21:44.651 --> 21:46.479
Yeah.

21:49.177 --> 21:52.136
Eileen did good, right?

21:52.180 --> 21:54.051
Getting us
back from hell.

21:54.095 --> 21:55.879
She doing okay?

21:55.923 --> 21:58.012
Yeah. I guess.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.448
You guess?

21:59.492 --> 22:01.232
If she needs something
from me, she'll tell me.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.017
We have an agreement.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.498
You have an agreement?

22:05.541 --> 22:07.195
That's adorable.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.372
Look, man, I didn't want
to say anything, okay,

22:10.416 --> 22:13.070
'cause I was kind of in a --
in a bad place,

22:13.114 --> 22:16.160
and, uh, yeah, I didn't
want to jinx it or whatever,

22:16.204 --> 22:20.991
but, you know, I tried
the family thing, right?

22:21.035 --> 22:22.341
Yeah, me too.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.647
And that's not for us.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.736
No, not really.

22:26.780 --> 22:30.479
But I'm just saying
if it was to work,

22:30.523 --> 22:33.177
Eileen, you know,
she gets it.

22:33.221 --> 22:36.006
She gets us.
She gets the life.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.356
She's hot.

22:38.705 --> 22:41.664
Dean.
I mean, I'm not even --

22:41.708 --> 22:46.234
Look, all I'm saying is you --
you could do worse, okay?

22:47.409 --> 22:50.673
And she could
certainly do better.

22:50.717 --> 22:53.720
Like, so much better.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.418
I'm happy
for you, Sammy.

23:10.084 --> 23:13.696
Maybe I should pick up
some kinda little job.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.394
A little job?

23:15.437 --> 23:17.221
Yeah.

23:17.265 --> 23:20.399
Yeah, I mean, these are the same
clothes we went to hell in.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.704
We're gonna have
expenses, right?

23:21.748 --> 23:23.445
And whatever change I had,
I spent on food,

23:23.489 --> 23:25.882
so, it's not like
I can go back to college.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.755
Not with
an archangel inside of me.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.236
Hello, Michael.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.456
Lilith.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.544
You're dead.

23:35.588 --> 23:36.893
Was.

23:36.937 --> 23:40.419
Now I'm back, baby.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.247
And I've been sent
to fetch you.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.989
I'm not accustomed
to being fetched.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.469
Who sent you?

23:47.513 --> 23:50.080
You have to ask?

23:50.124 --> 23:52.779
Your daddy.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.911
God.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.261
Yeah.
He'd like a word.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.437
You're lying.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.612
Really not.

23:59.655 --> 24:02.005
Then why would
he send you,

24:02.049 --> 24:06.445
a demon, a speck
of infernal bile?

24:06.488 --> 24:09.012
One, ouch.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.754
Two, maybe because
we worked together before.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.495
Remember?
Setting off the Apocalypse?

24:13.539 --> 24:14.801
To try and bring
God back.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.367
Right.

24:16.411 --> 24:19.109
Didn't work then, but then
he came back on his own.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.851
So, win?

24:24.985 --> 24:27.117
If that's true --

24:27.161 --> 24:30.947
if -- he can come
talk to me himself.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.297
Yeah, except

24:33.341 --> 24:35.125
I'm not supposed
to leave without you.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.300
Get out.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.824
Michael.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.611
I can't fail him.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.840
Whoa!

25:10.421 --> 25:12.249
Remember nothing.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.047
Yo, Donnie?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.527
I know where he is.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.529
Really?I think he's in -- Whoa!

25:30.572 --> 25:32.052
There!

25:32.095 --> 25:33.227
No, there!

25:33.270 --> 25:34.881
No, there!
There!

25:34.924 --> 25:36.186
Damn it, Donnie!

25:36.230 --> 25:38.188
He's hurtling
all over, Dean.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.234
There!

25:40.277 --> 25:42.018
Alright.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.672
He stopped.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.369
He seems
to be staying put.

25:45.413 --> 25:46.675
Okay, where?

25:46.719 --> 25:50.113
Cairo. Egypt.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.941
Excuse me.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.726
I need Bourbon.

25:58.774 --> 26:02.561
Alright, well, good news is
we know where he is.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.867
Bad news is we can't
get to him in time.

26:04.911 --> 26:07.914
Not before
he moves again.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.481
Then we bring
him to us.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.965
Michael.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.577
Michael.

26:21.841 --> 26:25.235
This is Castiel.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.803
We didn't know each
other very well,

26:27.847 --> 26:33.069
and our last meeting
was...unpleasant.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.898
But I know you have
been through

26:35.942 --> 26:40.076
a terrible ordeal
for many years.

26:40.120 --> 26:45.429
You've been beyond
the reach of heaven.

26:45.473 --> 26:49.433
Been beyond
the reach of Earth.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.132
Much has changed with both.

26:54.961 --> 26:59.095
Heaven is not what it was.

26:59.139 --> 27:05.493
And your father -- your father
is certainly not who you knew.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.453
Michael, there's a battle
raging, and you are a warrior,

27:09.497 --> 27:13.762
but you must know
the nature of this fight.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.460
I'm not your enemy anymore.

27:16.504 --> 27:20.769
Now we all have the same enemy.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.771
God Himself.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.699
Michael?

27:43.357 --> 27:44.967
Thank you.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.708
Thank you for coming.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.365
Do you remember me?

27:51.626 --> 27:55.804
You called "ass-butt"
and set me on fire.

27:55.848 --> 27:58.546
And then you helped
send me to hell.

27:58.589 --> 28:01.810
I did.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.725
And now what?

28:03.769 --> 28:06.336
You've come to tell me
that God, my father,

28:06.380 --> 28:09.905
creator of all things,
is my enemy?

28:09.949 --> 28:13.604
Or maybe you just came
to beg forgiveness.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.911
Oh, I didn't
come to beg.

28:46.942 --> 28:51.294
Castiel, what have you done?

28:55.603 --> 29:00.651
Even for you -- especially
for you, this is stupid.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.480
Good to see you,
too...Mike.

29:05.482 --> 29:08.224
Sam.
You look well.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.052
Last time I saw you
in the Cage...

29:10.096 --> 29:11.532
Yeah, it doesn't
matter.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.796
We need your help.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.146
God --I've heard.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.235
Repeatedly.

29:19.279 --> 29:20.323
Well, then you're
aware that --

29:20.367 --> 29:22.673
I'm not aware
of anything.

29:22.717 --> 29:26.112
You're asking me to trust you --
you, who doomed me,

29:26.155 --> 29:28.592
you, who let Lucifer
walk free while

29:28.636 --> 29:31.160
your own brother
sat in hell.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.468
Doing what we do,

29:34.511 --> 29:37.166
we've had to get used to
losing people.

29:37.210 --> 29:40.474
Probably too used to it.

29:40.517 --> 29:47.655
With Adam, we said goodbye
because we thought we had to.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.309
We were wrong.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.442
Well, don't tell me.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.662
Tell him.

30:01.669 --> 30:02.975
Hey, Sam.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.805
Dean.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.810
Adam?

30:11.853 --> 30:13.942
Ha!

30:13.986 --> 30:17.467
Wait, Mic-- Michael
lets you...talk?

30:17.511 --> 30:20.035
I mean, he lets you be?

30:20.079 --> 30:22.168
Uh, yeah.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.865
In the Cage, we came
to an agreement.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.085
We only had each other.

30:29.523 --> 30:34.484
Adam, look, I know
we bailed on you, okay,

30:34.528 --> 30:38.749
and there is nothing that
we can say to fix that.

30:38.793 --> 30:42.753
How about, uh...

30:42.797 --> 30:45.017
"I'm sorry"?

30:48.194 --> 30:52.067
Enough.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.417
Why am I here?

30:56.289 --> 30:59.031
Michael, we needed
to speak with you

30:59.074 --> 31:01.337
because God is back.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.773
You didn't think
the Cage just opened

31:02.817 --> 31:04.166
on its own,
did you?

31:04.210 --> 31:09.258
If my father is back,
he will usher in Paradise.

31:09.302 --> 31:11.391
Dean: No, he won't.

31:11.434 --> 31:14.873
Because Paradise is boring,
and your dad --

31:14.916 --> 31:17.788
he's just looking
to be entertained.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.790
Which means
we're his puppets.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.750
All of us, especially you.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.363
I won't hear this.

31:27.407 --> 31:28.887
You're lying.

31:28.930 --> 31:33.935
I don't know what your
agenda is, but you're lying.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.459
Michael.

31:40.246 --> 31:43.205
Hey.

31:43.249 --> 31:46.730
It's Adam.

31:46.774 --> 31:48.384
I'd give it a rest.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.909
He's not listening.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.826
So, I've been thinking.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.917
Maybe they're not lying.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.223
Ohh.H-Hear me out.

32:01.267 --> 32:04.226
Sam and Dean try to be
on the right side of things.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.619
They actually do.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.621
They tried to talk me out
of taking you on,

32:07.664 --> 32:09.971
for example,
out of all of this.

32:10.015 --> 32:10.972
So, you forgive them?

32:11.016 --> 32:12.974
Oh, hell, no. No.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.584
But that's not what
this is about.

32:14.628 --> 32:19.067
It's -- Look, if they tell you
something's off with God,

32:19.111 --> 32:21.069
it's because they
believe it's true.

32:21.113 --> 32:25.117
And if they believe it,
it probably is true.

32:28.816 --> 32:32.820
You and I have been
together for years.

32:32.863 --> 32:36.171
My father and I have been
together for eternity.

32:36.215 --> 32:38.304
I exist because
he willed it.

32:38.347 --> 32:41.611
So he's having
a mid-eternity crisis.

32:41.655 --> 32:45.180
Or -- Or, maybe
you don't know your dad

32:45.224 --> 32:46.660
as well as you
think you do.

32:46.703 --> 32:47.791
Oh.

32:47.835 --> 32:50.142
Mm.

32:51.926 --> 32:57.453
The point is parents
keep secrets, right?

32:57.497 --> 32:59.325
Does it hurt to ask
the question?

32:59.368 --> 33:01.457
Yes!

33:01.501 --> 33:03.372
It would.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.287
It would mean
that I doubt him.

33:05.331 --> 33:09.117
The good son, the favorite,
doubts his father.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.293
You still care
about that?

33:11.337 --> 33:13.904
After he left you
in the Cage?

33:16.864 --> 33:18.474
Sue: The vamps have stopped
moving just outside Omaha.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.041
They'll start
setting up a nest.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.043
We need to move on them
before they get

33:22.087 --> 33:23.523
their defenses
in place.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.177
Can you help?

33:25.220 --> 33:26.526
I...

33:26.569 --> 33:28.006
What?!

33:28.049 --> 33:30.182
Do you have to ask
for permission?

33:32.575 --> 33:35.665
Send me the directions.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.667
I just texted them
to you.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.541
Son of a bitch!

33:41.584 --> 33:42.846
Ohh!

33:49.592 --> 33:50.593
Hey.

33:50.637 --> 33:52.073
I was talking
to a friend.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.162
She's working
a vamp case.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.729
She's in trouble.

33:55.772 --> 33:58.036
Okay. Let's go.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.133
Adam?

34:10.135 --> 34:12.702
Not this time.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.226
I'll spare you
the effort.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.054
I'm not gonna betray
my father and everything

34:16.097 --> 34:18.447
I've believed in.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.710
Why not?

34:20.754 --> 34:23.191
You know,
he betrayed you.

34:23.235 --> 34:27.587
You know, Michael,
I never really liked you.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.197
Even when I was
just another angel,

34:29.241 --> 34:33.288
I thought you were
too haughty, too...

34:33.332 --> 34:35.725
To paraphrase a friend,

34:35.769 --> 34:40.382
you had an entire oak tree
shoved up your ass.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.992
But now?

34:42.036 --> 34:46.997
I'm looking at you,
and I...I just pity you.

34:47.041 --> 34:50.740
Because you were never
God's favorite.

34:50.784 --> 34:53.961
You were just
a little part of his story,

34:54.004 --> 34:56.442
a tiny part
of his story.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.618
You weren't even a star.

34:58.661 --> 35:04.276
At least Lucifer knew
that God can't be trusted.

35:06.669 --> 35:11.021
But I guess he was
always the smart one.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.823
See the truth for yourself.

35:30.998 --> 35:34.001
I'm a writer.
Lying's kinda what we do.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.134
Of all the Sams and Deans
in all the multiverse,

35:36.177 --> 35:37.439
you're my favorite show.

35:37.483 --> 35:40.660
And you were right.
I am a monster.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.009
Wait, you're
enjoying this.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.532
Shh.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.447
This isn't how the the story's
supposed to end!

35:45.491 --> 35:47.275
Dean: The story?
Wait, what are you saying?

35:47.319 --> 35:49.147
Sam: He's saying he's
been playing us.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.670
This whole time.
Everything.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.455
This is all you because
you wrote it all, right?

35:53.499 --> 35:54.848
Because we're your
favorite show?

35:54.891 --> 35:56.328
Because we're part
of your story?

35:56.371 --> 35:59.157
Dean: The Apocalypse,
with Lucifer and Michael,

35:59.200 --> 36:00.810
you knew everything
that was going on.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.377
Why didn't you just snap your
fingers and end it?!

36:05.032 --> 36:06.642
Chuck: Fine!
That's the way you want it?!

36:06.686 --> 36:08.862
Story's over.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.559
Welcome to the end.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.715
Maybe you went too far.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.632
Maybe.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.243
I mean, he's been
in lockdown for

36:42.287 --> 36:43.549
quite a while,
you know?

36:43.592 --> 36:47.727
Maybe you just,
uh, went too fast.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.907
What's he doing now?

36:55.561 --> 36:59.869
No idea.
He was very distraught.

36:59.913 --> 37:03.264
Yeah, but what exactly
did he say?

37:03.308 --> 37:06.702
"Leave. Get out.
I want you dead."

37:06.746 --> 37:08.661
We didn't bond.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.146
Where's Sam?

37:16.190 --> 37:18.236
Eileen hit a snag
with a case.

37:18.279 --> 37:22.240
So, he won't be
gone long.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.118
Michael.

37:38.691 --> 37:41.476
God lied to me.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.609
I gave everything for him.

37:43.652 --> 37:45.263
I loved him.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.742
Why?

37:46.786 --> 37:49.615
I'm not even
the only Michael.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.282
Okay.

38:27.827 --> 38:30.656
She said she saw
vampires here?

38:33.006 --> 38:34.355
It looks empty.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.878
Sue: Look again.

38:38.490 --> 38:42.058
Sue. You're okay.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.017
Thank God.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.846
Any time.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.677
Hi, Sam.

38:56.943 --> 39:00.512
So, yes,
I will help you.

39:01.208 --> 39:04.080
What was done in the darkness
can be done to God,

39:04.124 --> 39:05.821
if he's as weak
as you say.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.520
And I know how.

39:14.874 --> 39:16.876
That's the spell.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.924
And the ingredients?

39:21.968 --> 39:25.188
Myrrh, cassia,
rockrose.

39:25.232 --> 39:26.538
We've got that.

39:26.581 --> 39:29.192
And, to bind
the spell together,

39:29.236 --> 39:32.413
the nectar from
a Leviathan blossom.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.372
A Leviathan blossom?

39:34.415 --> 39:35.721
What is that,
like a flower?

39:35.764 --> 39:39.377
A flower that only
grows in one place.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.770
Purgatory.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.734
That's the door.

39:48.777 --> 39:52.215
It'll remain open
for 12 hours.

39:52.259 --> 39:55.436
Now, if you'll please...

40:08.493 --> 40:10.408
You coming with us?

40:10.451 --> 40:12.105
No.

40:14.934 --> 40:18.938
Before you go...

40:18.981 --> 40:21.462
can I talk to him?

40:30.602 --> 40:32.430
Yeah?

40:37.304 --> 40:43.353
Adam, I want you
to know...

40:43.397 --> 40:45.051
we are sorry.

40:47.227 --> 40:51.492
What happened to you...

40:51.536 --> 40:53.189
You're a good man.

40:55.627 --> 40:58.020
You didn't deserve that.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.811
Since when do we get
what we deserve?

41:11.512 --> 41:13.209
Good luck.
