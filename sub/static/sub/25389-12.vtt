00:01.260 --> 00:03.160
TERESA: Previously on
"Queen of the South"...

00:03.200 --> 00:04.827
I want you to be part
of the business.

00:04.870 --> 00:07.498
-Would you die for me?
-I'|| survive for you.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.565
What is this?
I never signed this paper.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.838
Camila's trying to set
you up to take the fall

00:10.870 --> 00:12.406
for her business.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.704
I'm leaving Camila.
Starting off on my own.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.207
Big britches you're
trying to fill, girl.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.706
I know the risks.

00:17.750 --> 00:18.899
TERESA: You tried
to set me up,

00:18.950 --> 00:20.815
but we can still make a deal.

00:20.850 --> 00:23.512
The only deal that goes on here
will put you in the grave.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.555
(gunshot)
(groans)

00:27.590 --> 00:29.922
CAMILA: I picked you.
I housed you.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.054
I protected you.
You kill Epifanio.

00:33.100 --> 00:37.218
CAMILA: You're gonna watch
the love of your life die

00:37.270 --> 00:39.591
a slow and painful death.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.494
GUERO: (screaming)

00:41.540 --> 00:43.064
Okay, he's not breathing.
Guero.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.169
You killed the man
that Teresa loved.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.770
I'm here _for a truce.
Teresa's busmess IS stalled.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.277
She needs my connection.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.777
She's not gonna want your help.

00:50.810 --> 00:53.278
She needs it.
And I certainly need hers.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.447
CAMILA: It's the only way
to save my daughter.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.687
I can set up the introduction
with the Colombians.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.085
What do you want in return?

00:59.120 --> 01:01.008
I want you to kill Cortez.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.085
You need more men.

01:03.130 --> 01:06.725
POTE: That's why we contacted
Javier Jimenez, Boaz's cousin.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.923
(suspenseful music)

01:09.970 --> 01:11.926
I'm rolling the dice on you,
Teresa.

01:11.970 --> 01:15.235
Together we can win.
We will run Phoenix.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.532
TERESA: We have a snitch.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.709
POTE: You don't think--James?

01:18.740 --> 01:20.207
I found the mole.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.730
JAMES: I can't work
for someone

01:21.780 --> 01:23.475
who keeps questioning
my loyalty.

01:23.510 --> 01:25.148
JAMES: Not after all
we've been through.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.875
I wanna help you
take out Cortez

01:26.920 --> 01:30.117
and make sure you're secure,
but then I'm out.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.708
TERESA: They put a tracker
in Guero's necklace.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.115
Can we use this?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.115
IVAN: To track someone?
Absolutely.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.650
IVAN: Bueno?

01:35.690 --> 01:37.487
TERESA: You have
something I want,

01:37.530 --> 01:40.454
and I have something you want.
Let's make a deal.

01:40.500 --> 01:47.429
*

02:04.350 --> 02:06.784
(indistinct chatter)

02:06.820 --> 02:09.789
(dramatic music)

02:09.830 --> 02:16.724
*

02:43.490 --> 02:47.290
The shipment looks good.
200 kilos, as promised.

02:47.330 --> 02:50.720
50 are yours.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.796
That's twice what
we talked about.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.731
You got into this business
to help your tribe survive.

02:57.770 --> 03:00.671
TERESA: If you agree to leave
in five years,

03:00.710 --> 03:03.042
I'll double your pay
until then.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.868
*

03:06.920 --> 03:09.172
You have my word.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.017
But I wouldn't count
on the General's.

03:11.050 --> 03:13.314
_ TAZA: And Cortez
IS slippery as a snake.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.729
You have a deal with him now,
but odds are it won't last.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.648
You should take precautions.

03:19.700 --> 03:26.594
*

03:30.710 --> 03:32.029
TERESA: How are you?

03:34.040 --> 03:35.871
Things went smooth at the port.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.709
That's not what I meant.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.447
I buried Bilal at sea.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.117
*

03:46.150 --> 03:48.948
That's what he
would have wanted.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.629
GEORGE: We both buried
family in this war.

03:51.660 --> 03:54.595
The ones we chose.

03:54.630 --> 03:58.964
GEORGE: Feels harder.
-It does.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.764
GEORGE: Cortez needs to die.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.700
*

04:03.740 --> 04:05.708
Y'all find him yet?

04:05.740 --> 04:10.541
*

04:10.580 --> 04:12.548
JAMES: This is a long shot.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.468
JAMES: For all we know,
Cortez found the medallion

04:14.520 --> 04:16.442
the second he laid
eyes on Camila.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.379
She could be lying dead
in a ditch somewhere.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.786
My family wouldn't shed a tear,

04:21.820 --> 04:23.754
and neither would Teresa.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.088
Reynaldo Fieto would,
he's the new connect.

04:26.130 --> 04:28.951
So we need to keep
an eye on Camila

04:29.000 --> 04:31.264
and make sure she's alive.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.631
Entiendes?

04:32.670 --> 04:33.989
(speaking Spanish)

04:34.040 --> 04:36.429
Eh, look at you
with the espaol.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.836
*

04:38.870 --> 04:40.804
JAMES: We're getting closer.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.604
If this works, we'll hit Cortez
before he knows what's coming.

04:43.650 --> 04:48.269
*

04:52.320 --> 04:54.015
CORTEZ: (sighs)

04:55.520 --> 04:56.851
CORTEZ:
(speaking Spanish)

05:04.970 --> 05:07.791
I don't know how you do it.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.265
CORTEZ: Even in captivity,
you remain so very lovely.

05:12.310 --> 05:16.508
Even more lovely, perhaps.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.040
(speaking Spanish)

05:18.080 --> 05:24.986
*

05:25.020 --> 05:27.181
(speaking Spanish)

05:27.220 --> 05:33.022
*

05:33.060 --> 05:36.120
You made me pozole once.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.128
You told me we were family.

05:38.170 --> 05:45.064
*

05:46.780 --> 05:50.671
Would you like to make pozole
for me again, Camila?

05:50.710 --> 05:53.019
I know you would give it
that perfect flavor.

05:53.050 --> 05:59.319
*

05:59.350 --> 06:02.729
I know what you do to your
big times, like Batman.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.387
*

06:04.430 --> 06:07.649
You don't scare me, Alberto.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.895
*

06:09.930 --> 06:11.989
Brave words

06:12.030 --> 06:14.863
from a woman in captivity.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.765
I want to see my daughter.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.108
Bring her to me.

06:19.140 --> 06:22.906
You want to_ double
the Ingredients?

06:22.950 --> 06:25.271
What a fine idea.

06:25.310 --> 06:27.039
I'll be happy to accommodate
your request.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.240
(speaking Spanish)

06:28.280 --> 06:32.558
(cell phone vibrating)

06:32.590 --> 06:36.424
(speaking Spanish)

06:36.460 --> 06:37.859
(phone vibrating)

06:37.890 --> 06:44.796
*

06:46.400 --> 06:47.890
Hola, Teresa.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.966
TERESA: We just received
your delivery.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.705
I take it all was in order.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.628
Yes, it was.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.946
George will oversee
the transport through Mexico.

06:58.980 --> 07:01.448
I'm glad to hear our prisoner
exchange has worked out

07:01.480 --> 07:03.380
as well for you
as it has for me.

07:03.420 --> 07:06.719
I guaranteed the Colombians
Camila's safety.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.981
If something happens to her,
we both lose our product.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.726
Camila is exactly
where she should be.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.591
Reynaldo has nothing to fear.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.769
(phone clicks)

07:19.840 --> 07:22.604
Heads up.
We got trouble.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.165
(tires squealing)

07:25.210 --> 07:26.507
Shit.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.076
(suspenseful music)

07:28.110 --> 07:30.169
(indistinct chatter)

07:30.210 --> 07:32.303
Damn it!

07:32.350 --> 07:35.774
*

07:35.820 --> 07:37.640
POTE: We're surrounded.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.282
GEORGE: There's no
way out of this.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.037
-You know her?
-No.

07:59.070 --> 08:01.334
If it was a ambush they would
have already hit us by now.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.775
POTE: We need to do this.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.469
We'll cover you.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.317
(gun cocking)

08:14.090 --> 08:16.684
(car doors closing)

08:22.100 --> 08:24.193
I'm Castel Fieto.

08:24.230 --> 08:26.539
You made a deal with my uncle,
but not with me.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.868
Is el Reynaldo in charge
of your family?

08:28.900 --> 08:30.765
He is.
For now.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.544
Hey.

08:36.580 --> 08:39.242
Let me be frank with you,
Teresa.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.816
It's okay.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.511
CASTEL: Camila and Reynaldo
are dinosaurs,

08:42.550 --> 08:44.086
the way they run
their business.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.089
I have connections
In government.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.758
With politicians.

08:48.790 --> 08:51.850
Investments far beyond
the realm of cocaine.

08:51.890 --> 08:55.223
CASTEL: Your innovations with
product and distribution,

08:55.260 --> 08:56.568
cryptocu rrency--

08:56.600 --> 08:58.192
You know a_ lot
about my busmess.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.165
CASTEL: Like I said,
I have connections.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.430
And that's my point.

09:03.470 --> 09:05.734
Camila and Reynaldo,
they".

09:05.770 --> 09:07.829
They don't know technology
like we do.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.907
CASTEL: They're the past,
and you and I,

09:11.950 --> 09:14.441
we're the future.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.210
You didn't come all the way
from Bogot to praise me.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.081
(dramatic music)

09:19.120 --> 09:22.055
CASTEL: You struck
a dangerous deal.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.955
The only true way
to power is violence.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.254
And Cortez,
he won't hesitate to use it.

09:26.290 --> 09:29.862
He delights in it,
like a child with a plaything.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.893
He knows what's at stake.
He won't hurt Camila.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.931
CASTEL: But he will harm you.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.131
Look how easily I got to you.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.479
My spies inside the General's
organization say

09:40.510 --> 09:42.398
he's already planning it.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.704
A strike against you
is imminent.

09:44.750 --> 09:51.644
*

09:56.520 --> 10:00.490
JAMES: There he is.
The tracker worked.

10:00.530 --> 10:03.169
JAVIER: I say we
raid the place.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.760
Knock those stars right
off the General's shoulder.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.190
Along with his pinche cabeza.

10:10.340 --> 10:13.332
JAMES: I had a run-in
with Cortez once.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.507
JAMES: His time will come.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.679
JAMES: But we wait
for Teresa's orders.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.446
(car door closes)

10:23.990 --> 10:27.050
There's Isabela.
Camila's here.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.089
(dramatic music)

10:31.130 --> 10:36.250
*

10:36.300 --> 10:39.292
(door unlocking)

10:39.330 --> 10:40.866
(door closes)

10:40.900 --> 10:45.030
*

10:45.070 --> 10:47.800
Are you okay?

10:47.840 --> 10:48.875
Did he hurt you?

10:48.910 --> 10:50.605
(softly) No.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.868
But you did.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.547
I did not order Kique's death.

10:54.580 --> 10:56.275
You have to believe me,
Isabela.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.187
*

10:59.220 --> 11:01.882
I don't care
ifI die right now.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.457
As long as you understand that.

11:04.490 --> 11:07.027
I know I hurt you.

11:07.060 --> 11:09.358
I just wish you
could forgive me.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.892
CORTEZ: Careful what
you wish for, Camila.

11:12.940 --> 11:17.206
Even if your daughter
does forgive you,

11:17.240 --> 11:19.800
doesn't mean that justice
is served for Kique.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.478
CAMILA: Isabela...

11:21.510 --> 11:23.046
*

11:23.080 --> 11:24.502
(blade scrapes)

11:26.180 --> 11:27.670
(gun cocking)

11:27.720 --> 11:29.142
CAMILA: NO.

11:29.180 --> 11:32.581
*

11:32.620 --> 11:34.212
CORTEZ: An eye for an eye.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.887
Look at me.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.855
CORTEZ: The Bible says...
-Don't listen to him.

11:38.890 --> 11:41.927
What do you think
God would want in exchange

11:41.960 --> 11:45.669
for the life of the man
your daughter loved?

11:45.700 --> 11:48.760
Don't listen to him, Isabela.
Look at me.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.406
Now is the time for vengeance.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.101
He lied.

11:54.140 --> 11:57.246
CORTEZ: Because of her,
you have no father.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.100
No husband.

11:59.150 --> 12:01.277
*

12:01.320 --> 12:03.845
She's given you
nothing but pain.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.380
Don't listen to him.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.911
On your knees.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.780
*

12:09.830 --> 12:11.183
Now.

12:11.230 --> 12:18.124
*

12:25.110 --> 12:27.635
ISABELA: You have to pay
for what you did to Kique.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.979
*

12:31.010 --> 12:33.149
ISABELA: I don't believe you.

12:33.180 --> 12:40.109
*

12:42.860 --> 12:44.452
(gun clicks)

12:45.860 --> 12:47.498
CORTEZ: (chuckles)

12:47.530 --> 12:48.724
*

12:48.760 --> 12:50.990
How truly disappointing.

This is between us, Alberto.

CORTEZ: For a single moment
I just felt like

13:19.560 --> 13:21.528
we would be a family.

You don't believe her?

TERESA: I do.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.994
What I don't understand
is why she would warn me.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.533
She needs you in Phoenix.

She wants something else.

Camila and her daughter.

Cortez hid a bomb

-Is anyone hurt?
TERESA: Yeah.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.893

the southern perimeter.

a Trojan horse.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.958
How are you, muequita?

27:45.990 --> 27:48.493
CAMILA: Much better
now that we're safe.

27:48.530 --> 27:51.795
Cortez did the wise thing
by calling us when he did.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.229
He protected you.

27:53.270 --> 27:55.568
Cortez was just
protecting his business.

27:55.600 --> 27:59.832
If it was up to him,
Isabela and I would be dead.

27:59.870 --> 28:02.077
REYNALDO: Nevertheless,
you're safe now.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.873
Castel is on her way,
and with the men

28:03.910 --> 28:05.070
that I sent you,

28:05.110 --> 28:06.873
you can kill Teresa.

28:06.910 --> 28:09.049
REYNALDO: And we can be
done with this pendejada

28:09.080 --> 28:11.719
once and for all.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.479
(blow lands)
JAMES: (shouts)

28:13.520 --> 28:18.082
(speaking Spanish)

28:18.130 --> 28:20.018
He looks tenderized
enough for you?

28:20.060 --> 28:22.096
Not quite.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.259
Everything's better with
a little more Tapato.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.360
(groans)

28:29.400 --> 28:30.662
(spits)

28:30.700 --> 28:34.375
JAVIER: Last chance, pendejo.

28:34.410 --> 28:36.332
Where's Camila?

28:36.380 --> 28:40.009
(speaking Spanish)

28:40.050 --> 28:42.018
GEORGE: Seems you got
a problem, General.

28:42.050 --> 28:44.416
*

28:44.450 --> 28:47.385
If I remember correctly,
isn't that what you said

28:47.420 --> 28:49.354
Bilal had?

28:49.390 --> 28:51.927
GEORGE: You helped him out
with a little procedure.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.123
Now it seems like maybe
you could benefit

28:55.160 --> 28:57.458
from the very same thing.

28:57.500 --> 29:02.597
Only, uh, I'm gonna use
a different scalpel.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.428
BOAZ: (speaking Spanish)

29:06.470 --> 29:09.701
You raped and pillaged
your way to the top.

29:09.740 --> 29:13.813
BOAZ: You enjoyed feasting
on the hearts of your enemies.

29:13.850 --> 29:20.289
And now I--
we're gonna take yours.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.288
*

29:22.320 --> 29:23.878
See you in hell, pendejo.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.080
(speaking Spanish)

29:26.130 --> 29:27.427
(chainsaw revs)

29:27.460 --> 29:29.599
(speaking Spanish)

29:29.630 --> 29:31.427
BOAZ: I'll bring the tortillas.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.961
(chainsaw revs)

29:34.000 --> 29:35.831
-(screams)
BOAZ: (laughs)

29:35.870 --> 29:37.098
(shouts)

29:38.770 --> 29:42.228
(cell phone buzzing)

29:42.280 --> 29:43.804
TERESA: Hello?

29:43.850 --> 29:45.977
CASTEL: You survived
Cortez's strike.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.910
I assume the General
wasn't as lucky.

29:47.950 --> 29:49.474
He was not.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.442
CASTEL: Now you control
the Phoenix corridor

29:51.490 --> 29:53.310
all the way down to Sinaloa.

29:53.350 --> 29:55.853
Smuggling and distribution.

29:55.890 --> 29:57.824
CASTEL: You have my support,
Teresa.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.124
There's just one more thing
that needs to be settled.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.320
Camila.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.590
She isn't far from Phoenix.

30:03.630 --> 30:05.962
Send me your address
so I can make arrangements.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.434
I thought your uncle
wanted to protect her.

30:08.470 --> 30:11.200
CASTEL: My uncle and I don't
always agree on everything.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.867
Camila's one of them.

30:12.910 --> 30:15.003
I'm betting on you, Teresa.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.347
(dramatic music)

30:18.380 --> 30:19.449
JAMES: Giving us Camila

30:19.480 --> 30:20.845
against her uncle's wishes.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.848
Sounds like a setup to me.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.780
I say we jump in
a pinche plane

30:24.820 --> 30:27.288
and get the hell
out of here.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.049
We have to do this.

30:29.090 --> 30:36.019
*

30:43.910 --> 30:46.902
(car doors opening and closing)

30:54.280 --> 30:56.578
Time to settle accounts

30:56.620 --> 30:58.212
once and for all.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.785
(car door opens)

31:05.890 --> 31:08.859
(dramatic music)

31:08.900 --> 31:15.499
*

31:15.540 --> 31:17.098
Just say the word

31:17.140 --> 31:18.437
and I'll put
a bullet in her head.

31:18.470 --> 31:20.028
Easy, gordo.

31:20.070 --> 31:26.976
*

31:30.120 --> 31:32.008
What about your uncle?

31:32.050 --> 31:34.359
*

31:34.390 --> 31:36.517
CASTEL: As far as he
and Camila know,

31:36.560 --> 31:38.778
she was being taken
to a safe house.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.253
I'll handle him.
Finish it.

31:41.300 --> 31:46.522
*

31:46.570 --> 31:48.367
(gun cocks)

31:48.400 --> 31:55.306
*

32:08.320 --> 32:11.118
-You brought this on yourself.
-Do it.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.151
(dramatic music)

32:13.190 --> 32:16.421
We would have ended up
in the same place, you know.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.394
There can only
be one queen.

32:18.430 --> 32:20.660
You think I'm competing
with you?

32:20.700 --> 32:23.168
*

32:23.200 --> 32:25.760
You've never known me
or understood who I am.

32:25.810 --> 32:29.405
CAMILA: You tell yourself that.
I know the truth.

32:29.440 --> 32:33.240
I knew it from the first
time I took you in.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.145
I can see it in your eyes.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.842
CAMILA: You're a wolf,
just like me.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.780
I am nothing like you.

32:39.820 --> 32:44.359
Oh, you don't see it now.
But you will in time.

32:44.390 --> 32:46.483
CAMILA: And then
you'll understand

32:46.530 --> 32:48.521
why I did what I did.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.198
And you'll thank me.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.619
Thank you?

32:52.670 --> 32:57.369
Your ego is blind to all
the pain you have caused.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.665
Even with a gun in my hand,

33:00.710 --> 33:03.929
with every reason to kill you,

33:03.980 --> 33:07.643
your arrogance still makes you
believe that you matter.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.341
*

33:09.380 --> 33:11.712
I allow you to become what
you always wanted to be.

33:11.750 --> 33:15.015
You allow me?
Who are you to allow me?

33:15.060 --> 33:17.312
Teresa...

33:17.360 --> 33:20.818
-You're my greatest legacy.
-You are crazy.

33:20.860 --> 33:27.390
*

33:27.430 --> 33:29.398
(gunshot)

33:32.540 --> 33:34.701
TERESA: You're gonna live
the rest of your life

33:34.740 --> 33:37.300
as a fugitive
from your own country.

33:37.340 --> 33:38.876
*

33:38.910 --> 33:42.016
-I'm sending you into exile.
-Kill me now.

33:42.050 --> 33:43.813
*

33:43.850 --> 33:45.488
Or this won't be
the last time you see me--

33:45.520 --> 33:47.647
It will

33:47.690 --> 33:50.909
if you want
Isabela to live.

33:50.960 --> 33:54.657
TERESA: Castel has her and is
keeping her safe for now.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.022
You already destroyed her life.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.924
You killed her innocence.

33:59.970 --> 34:02.666
*

34:02.700 --> 34:04.429
Try to make a move against me.

34:04.470 --> 34:06.836
*

34:06.870 --> 34:08.269
You know what will
happen to her.

34:08.310 --> 34:15.239
*

34:16.320 --> 34:17.878
(speaking Spanish)

34:17.920 --> 34:24.826
*

34:31.330 --> 34:32.763
(car door closes)

34:32.800 --> 34:35.030
(car engine starts)

34:35.070 --> 34:41.976
*

34:46.250 --> 34:47.774
GEORGE: You eat people.
I heard this.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.973
(laughter)
GEORGE: There she is.

34:51.020 --> 34:53.739
Cortez is gone

34:53.790 --> 34:56.054
and you have a deal
with the Colombians.

34:56.090 --> 34:58.729
(Spanish music playing)

34:58.760 --> 35:00.227
Gracias.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.922
48 hours ago,
we didn't have a supplier.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.463
GEORGE: Now we own the corridor
all the way from Sinaloa

35:05.500 --> 35:08.139
down to Phoenix.

35:08.170 --> 35:09.489
Salud.

35:09.540 --> 35:13.431
all: Salud.

35:13.470 --> 35:14.903
(glass clinking)

35:14.940 --> 35:16.407
*

35:16.440 --> 35:19.739
Can I have a word with you?

35:19.780 --> 35:22.078
What is it?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.940
Not here.

35:23.980 --> 35:28.815
all: (speaking quietly)

35:31.390 --> 35:33.654
JAMES: Look, I have to go.
You don't need me anymore.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.851
JAMES: You have that army.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.289
I'm sorry.

35:38.330 --> 35:39.763
Don't be.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.165
JAMES:
It's been a hell of a ride.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.168
This is where I get off.

35:45.070 --> 35:46.469
Your mind's made up?

35:47.570 --> 35:49.106
JAMES: Yeah.

35:49.140 --> 35:52.507
(dramatic music)

35:52.550 --> 35:53.869
I'm gonna miss you.

35:53.910 --> 36:00.839
*

36:08.830 --> 36:11.025
I'll see you around.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.391
TERESA: Take care of yourself.

36:12.430 --> 36:14.569
*

36:14.600 --> 36:15.669
You, too.

36:15.700 --> 36:22.606
*

36:36.560 --> 36:38.425
POTE: You're leaving us,
aren't you?

36:45.300 --> 36:47.222
Gonna miss you, cabron.

36:47.270 --> 36:48.669
(dramatic music)

36:48.700 --> 36:50.839
Hey, you take care of her.

36:50.870 --> 36:52.701
*

36:52.740 --> 36:54.002
Always.

36:54.040 --> 37:00.900
*

37:00.950 --> 37:03.009
JAVIER: There he goes.

37:03.050 --> 37:05.189
The second best shot in Mexico.

37:05.220 --> 37:08.553
*

37:08.590 --> 37:09.784
He's a good soldier.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.856
*

37:11.890 --> 37:13.187
He'll be hard to replace.

37:13.230 --> 37:16.950
*

37:17.000 --> 37:19.389
You know anyone
who might be interested?

37:19.430 --> 37:23.264
*

37:23.300 --> 37:25.302
I might know a guy.

37:25.340 --> 37:27.638
*

37:27.670 --> 37:29.308
He's not cheap.

37:29.340 --> 37:36.269
*

37:55.140 --> 37:57.461
DEVON: Teresa must really
be something special.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.435
I was half expecting you
to run after my call.

38:00.470 --> 38:02.700
I told her it was
my deCI5ion to leave.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.170
I know you can't run
from the CIA.

38:06.210 --> 38:08.246
How long have you known?

38:08.280 --> 38:09.941
JAMES: The tracker you put
on Teresa's medallion,

38:09.980 --> 38:11.584
the hit on El Santo.

38:11.620 --> 38:14.111
One thing I can't figure out
is your connection

38:14.150 --> 38:16.311
with the Colombians.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.079
Castel, she work
for the agency?

38:19.130 --> 38:20.859
She's an asset.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.357
(dramatic music)

38:22.400 --> 38:25.198
So that's why you
were hunting El Santo.

38:25.230 --> 38:27.664
To take out the competition
for the Colombians.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.361
DEVON: She's a friend
of the agency.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.960
El Santo wasn't.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.659
Killing him served
both our purposes.

38:33.710 --> 38:35.507
And Teresa?

38:35.540 --> 38:38.941
DEVON: Teresa will be safe
as long as she's useful to us.

38:38.980 --> 38:41.676
You, on the other hand,
you're a liability.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.144
That mess you made in Texas,

38:45.190 --> 38:46.817
this is how we clean it up.

38:46.850 --> 38:48.989
DEVON: You come with us
so you won't be able

38:49.020 --> 38:50.487
to drag her down with you.

38:50.520 --> 38:57.426
*

39:58.260 --> 40:01.229
(somber singing)

40:01.260 --> 40:08.166

40:13.770 --> 40:16.739
(upbeat dramatic music)

40:16.780 --> 40:23.674
*

40:33.460 --> 40:36.497
-No, gracias.
-Take the pillow.

40:36.530 --> 40:38.327
It's gonna be a long flight.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.760
(speaking Spanish)

40:40.800 --> 40:44.566
JAVIER: Mmm.
(speaking Spanish)

40:44.610 --> 40:46.237
JAVIER: (grunts)

40:46.270 --> 40:48.409

40:48.440 --> 40:50.738
(speaking Spanish)

40:50.780 --> 40:52.839
*

40:52.880 --> 40:55.940
You say we have a long flight?

40:55.980 --> 40:58.141
Where are we going?

40:58.180 --> 40:59.613
You'll see.

40:59.650 --> 41:06.658
