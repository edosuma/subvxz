00:14.240 --> 00:16.902
- SPECIAL GIRL, HUH?

00:16.950 --> 00:18.474
- YEAH, KIND OF.

00:18.510 --> 00:20.512
- WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU
APPLYING YOURSELF.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.541
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU PUT
A LOT OF WORK INTO THAT.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.888
- THANKS, DAD, BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GONNA SEND IT.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.309
- WHY?
WHY, SHAWN?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.089
- THERE ARE OBSTACLES.
- OBSTACLES?

00:29.130 --> 00:30.358
ALL COUPLES HAVE OBSTACLES.

00:30.390 --> 00:32.199
THE KEY TO IT IS,
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW

00:32.230 --> 00:34.357
UNLESS YOU PUT YOURSELF
OUT THERE.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.425
- GUS SAYS IT'LL NEVER WORK.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.869
- GUS? WHAT DOES GUS KNOW?
GUS IS 12.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.265
YOU REMEMBER
AT THAT SKATE PARTY

00:39.300 --> 00:42.064
HOW HE CRIED WHEN THAT GIRL
TOUCHED HIS ARM? GUS.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.635
COME ON.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:44.670 --> 00:46.570
- LET'S SEE.
THE HEART IS GOOD.

00:46.610 --> 00:48.009
YOU TELL HER THAT
YOU THINK SHE'S PRETTY,

00:48.040 --> 00:50.179
BUT NOT IN AN CREEPY,
AGGRESSIVE KIND OF WAY.

00:50.210 --> 00:51.438
I LIKE THAT.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.072
YOU KNOW, DOWN HERE, I THINK
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS,

00:53.120 --> 00:54.417
I THINK YOU WANT TO TELL HER

00:54.450 --> 00:56.611
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO CALL
HER SOMETIME.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.641
DO THAT.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.578
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU FORGOT
TO ADDRESS IT THERE.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.781
YOU WANT TO WRITE HER
NAME BIG AND PRETTY,

01:02.830 --> 01:04.718
MAKE HER THINK
SHE'S IMPORTANT.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.398
YOU KNOW
HOW SOMETIMES I WRITE

01:06.430 --> 01:07.852
AND I DO THE CALLIGRAPHY
WITH BIG LOOPS

01:07.900 --> 01:11.791
AND SWOOPING LETTERS?
DO THAT, DO THAT UP THERE.

01:11.830 --> 01:15.038
- DAD, COULD YOU DO IT?

01:15.070 --> 01:18.767
- YEAH, SURE, I GUESS.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.404
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S HER NAME?

01:21.440 --> 01:24.603
- UH, MRS. PHILLIPS.

01:32.090 --> 01:35.082
[upbeat dance music]

01:54.980 --> 01:56.709
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.945
- I HATE HAVING TO HIDE
WHAT WE HAVE.

01:58.980 --> 02:02.416
YOU KNOW,
WE CAN'T REALLY BE TOGETHER

02:02.450 --> 02:04.589
UNTIL YOU TELL HER.

02:04.620 --> 02:07.259
- I WILL. SOON.

02:09.260 --> 02:11.455
- MINA?

02:11.490 --> 02:13.720
YOU'RE BACK ON IN TWO MINUTES.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.434
- I'LL GO.
- NO.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.631
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB
YOUR RITUAL.

02:22.670 --> 02:24.501
IT'S BAD LUCK.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.609
- [sighs]

02:46.860 --> 02:49.522
- [screams]

02:49.570 --> 02:52.767
- THIS IS
MY "I TOLD YOU SO" ROOM,

02:52.800 --> 02:54.939
WHERE I LIKE TO GLOAT AFTER
A COMPLETELY WILD ACCUSATION

02:54.970 --> 02:56.437
TURNS OUT TO BE SPOT ON.

02:56.470 --> 02:57.937
THAT'S MY "OOPS" CORNER,

02:57.970 --> 02:59.779
WHERE I APOLOGIZE TO PEOPLE
FOR BEING ARRESTED

02:59.810 --> 03:01.277
AFTER A COMPLETELY
WILD ACCUSATION

03:01.310 --> 03:02.902
TURNS OUT TO BE JUST THAT.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.578
OVER THERE IS WHERE YOU GET GUM.
FREE, BY THE WAY.

03:05.610 --> 03:06.713
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.071
UM, THIS IS...

03:09.120 --> 03:12.556
- I KNOW YOU. I MET YOU
AT OUR HIGH-SCHOOL REUNION.

03:12.590 --> 03:16.253
- YES. YES, YOU DID.
SHAWN TELLS ME YOU'RE A TEACHER.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.552
- YEAH, KINDERGARTEN.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.421
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.
I THINK THAT'S GREAT.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.052
I MEAN, KIDS,
THEY'RE--THEY'RE SO GREAT.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.522
THAT MUST BE REALLY FUN.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.925
YOU KNOW, I LOVED
MY KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

03:24.970 --> 03:26.267
YEAH, BEFORE I WENT
INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT,

03:26.300 --> 03:27.995
I ACTUALLY
CONSIDERED TEACH--

03:28.040 --> 03:31.009
- THIS IS
DETECTIVE CARLTON LASSITER.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.406
I DO HIS JOB
AND SOMETIMES HIS HAIR,

03:33.440 --> 03:34.930
THOUGH CLEARLY NOT TODAY.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.902
- I'M REALLY SORRY, SPENCER.
I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU TODAY.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.817
I'M ABOUT TO GO SOLVE ANOTHER
CASE AND DO IT IN RECORD TIME.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.738
HELLO.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.111
- IT IS AT THIS POINT
THAT I MUST DECIDE

03:43.150 --> 03:45.584
WHICH PART OF THAT VERY BOLD
STATEMENT TO RIFF OFF OF.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.258
NOW, I CAN HONE IN
ON "ANOTHER,"

03:47.290 --> 03:49.053
WHICH IMPLIES THAT HE'S SOLVED
MORE THAN ONE.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.421
- THAT'S PRETTY EASY, THOUGH.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.428
- OR I CRACK DOWN
ON "RECORD TIME"

03:52.460 --> 03:55.054
AND POSIT THAT, FOR HIM, RECORD
TIME IS, LIKE, 2 1/2 YEARS.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.226
- GOOD, NOT GREAT.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.692
- YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN.
- YOU LOVE IT.

03:57.730 --> 04:02.565
- I KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME
AND WAIT FOR ME NOT TO CALL YOU?

04:02.610 --> 04:03.702
- HE'S JUST SAYING THAT

04:03.740 --> 04:05.264
SO THAT IT'LL BE
MORE DRAMATIC LATER ON

04:05.310 --> 04:06.504
WHEN HE HAS TO ASK FOR MY HELP.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.679
- MORE DRAMATIC FOR WHO?

04:08.710 --> 04:12.009
- I DON'T KNOW.
THAT GUY, I GUESS.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.777
[door opens]

04:17.250 --> 04:20.617
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT EXACTLY
IS THIS INFORMATION

04:20.660 --> 04:22.958
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT
BEHIND THE THEATER EARLIER?

04:22.990 --> 04:24.719
- THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.695
- REALLY?
WELL, THAT'S HELPFUL.

04:27.730 --> 04:31.063
AND YOU, UM--
YOU KNOW THE VICTIM?

04:31.100 --> 04:34.263
- VICTIMS, PLURAL.
MINA WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.

04:34.300 --> 04:37.133
FORTUNATELY, SHE IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO DIDN'T GET HURT.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.970
- SIR, YOU ARE EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED TODAY.

04:41.010 --> 04:42.443
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO THIS QUICK

04:42.480 --> 04:44.072
WHILE HIS GIRLFRIEND
IS STILL WAITING.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.441
- I'M SORRY, WHOSE GIRLFRIEND?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.414
- OH, NEVER YOU MIND.
I'M JUST THINKING OUT LOUD.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.917
DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT
YOUR FLOW.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.349
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

04:50.390 --> 04:52.585
SO LET'S JUST GO STRAIGHT
TO THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION:

04:52.620 --> 04:54.451
WHO EXACTLY IS RESPONSIBLE?

04:56.290 --> 04:58.121
- I AM.
I HURT THEM ALL.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.094
I'M A DANGER
TO EVERYONE AROUND ME.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.119
- ALL RIGHT, MR. SINGH,
THIS IS HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.889
SEE, SOMETIMES THERE ARE THESE
BLEEDING-HEART ACT IVIST JUDGES

05:07.940 --> 05:09.760
WHO WON'T TAKE A DETECTIVE'S
IRON-CLAD WORD FOR IT

05:09.810 --> 05:12.529
WHEN HE GETS A PERFECTLY
UNCOERCED CONFESSION.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.708
SO JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

05:15.740 --> 05:17.549
I'D LIKE YOU TO WRITE
EVERYTHING DOWN.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.275
WHEN YOU DID IT,
WHERE YOU DID IT,

05:19.310 --> 05:20.538
WHY YOU DID IT.

05:20.580 --> 05:21.842
NOW, THE WHY IS VERY IMPORTANT.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.144
YOU'RE DONE?
- YES.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.543
- YOU JUST WROTE,
LIKE, THREE WORDS.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.512
- MM-HMM.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.052
- WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

05:38.700 --> 05:39.962
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.934
- THIS PLACE WAS ACTUALLY BUILT
BY THE AMISH,

05:42.970 --> 05:45.404
WHICH EXPLAINS THE COMPLETE
AND UTTER LACK OF ZIPPERS.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.670
- [laughs]
- SPENCER?

05:47.710 --> 05:49.132
I WAS TOO HARSH.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.569
- WHEN?
- JUST NOW.

05:51.610 --> 05:53.771
PERHAPS ALWAYS.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.845
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS, THE GUY
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM "A"

05:55.880 --> 05:58.815
IS A SOLID LEAD,
AND I JUST DON'T HAVE THE--

05:58.850 --> 06:00.317
YOU KNOW, TO FOLLOW THROUGH.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.759
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

06:01.790 --> 06:04.623
- I'M SAYING I NEED YOUR HELP.

06:04.660 --> 06:07.094
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT ONLY IF ABIGAIL CAN WATCH.

06:07.130 --> 06:09.598
- NO, NO. NO.
- SHH.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.427
- I'LL PUT A CHAIR
IN THE VIEWING ROOM.

06:11.470 --> 06:14.633

INSPIRE FEAR AND AWE

EXPERIENCE THEM.

WHO WILL UNDERSTAND ME.

YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

07:18.370 --> 07:19.598
I AM YOUR FRIEND.

YOU DON'T REALLY STRIKE ME

07:32.310 --> 07:33.675

HOW COULD YOU COMMIT
THESE CRIMES?

07:35.550 --> 07:38.519

THE ATTACKS, THEY JUST HAPPEN.

EVEN I CAN'T PREDICT IT.

07:54.040 --> 07:59.364
I CAN JUST BE ALONE IN A ROOM
WITH SOMEBODY.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.002
- GOT IT.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.838
WELL, IN THAT CASE, RAJ,

08:03.880 --> 08:06.144
I-I THINK ALL THAT'S LEFT HERE,

08:06.180 --> 08:09.843
QUESTION-WISE, IS "WHY?"

08:09.890 --> 08:12.814
I MEAN, WHY, WHY,
WHY DO YOU HURT THESE PEOPLE?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.350
- WHY HAVE I HURT THESE PEOPLE?

08:14.390 --> 08:17.826
- YOU GOT TO SEE THIS.
WAIT FOR IT. HERE IT COMES.

08:17.860 --> 08:20.590

YES, I WIN.

OH, THIS IS--THIS IS
COMPLETELY SATISFYING.

- YOU'RE A PSYCHIC.
YOU MUST BELIEVE ME.

08:42.850 --> 08:46.308
YOU MUST BE ABLE TO HELP ME.
CAN YOU?

08:46.350 --> 08:49.217
- YES, I CAN, ROGER.
- [sighs]

08:49.260 --> 08:51.251
- I WILL BREAK YOUR CURSE,

08:51.290 --> 08:53.656
AND I WILL SOLVE THIS CASE,

08:53.700 --> 08:55.497
MOSTLY...

08:55.530 --> 08:59.762

- IT WAS A SNOBBY GUY AND AN
EFFEMINATE DUDE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

10:48.410 --> 10:49.946
- APPLES AND ORANGES.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.369
- THIS IS A LOVE CURSE.
YEAH.

10:52.410 --> 10:53.968
THIS POOR GUY THINKS
THERE'S SOME KIND OF HEX

10:54.020 --> 10:56.011
ON ALL THE GIRLS
HE TRIES TO HOOK UP WITH.

10:56.050 --> 10:57.540
WE JUST NEED TO DO
SOME INVESTIGATING,

10:57.590 --> 10:59.410
FIND SOME EVIDENCE,
CONVINCE HIM HE'S NOT CURSED

10:59.450 --> 11:02.248
SO THAT HE CAN LIVE A FULL AND
HAPPY LIFE WITH HIS LADY LOVE.

11:02.290 --> 11:05.259
MAN, THIS IS A MATTER
OF THE HEART.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.322
- HE'S PAYING US, RIGHT?

11:07.360 --> 11:08.793
- YEAH, CASH.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.960
THE LAST FOUR WOMEN
THAT I'VE DATED

11:15.000 --> 11:16.592
HAVE ALL HAD
TERRIBLE ACCIDENTS.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.835
AND WITH EACH GIRL,
IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE.

11:18.870 --> 11:20.406
THE FIRST ONE
HAD A CAR ACCIDENT.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.702
ANOTHER'S APARTMENT
BURN ED DOWN.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.401
- WHAT DO YOU DO
AFTER THESE THINGS HAPPEN?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.145
- I BREAK UP WITH THEM.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.614
I HAVE TRIED TO BE ALONE,
BELIEVE ME, I HAVE,

11:27.650 --> 11:30.687
BUT THEN I MET MINA, AND
MY HEART COULDN'T HELP ITSELF.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.813
I JUST KEEP THINKING THAT
THE NEXT TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT,

11:32.860 --> 11:35.181
BUT EVERY WOMAN
THAT I FALL IN LOVE WITH

11:35.220 --> 11:37.381
IS TARGETED BY FORCES
I CAN'T FIGHT.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.751
- DO YOU HAVE ANY ENEMIES
IN THIS WORLD?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.097
- I'M A NICE GUY.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.995
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY
WOULD WANT TO CURSE ME.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.520
- YOU ARE A NICE GUY, ROGER.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.367
AND I PRESUME
YOU COULD TEACH US BOTH

11:46.400 --> 11:47.628
A THING OR TWO ABOUT CRICKET.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.331
BUT LET'S NOT JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.703
JUST SHOW ME WHERE
THIS ACCIDENT OCCURRED.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.277
- IT WAS JUST
INAPPROPRIATE, CARLTON,

11:55.310 --> 11:56.800
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND
STANDING THERE.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.044
- WHEN HAS ANYTHING

11:58.080 --> 12:00.219
HE'S EVER DONE TO ME
BEEN APPROPRIATE?

12:00.250 --> 12:02.718
HAVING HIS GIRLFRIEND THERE
WAS JUST A GIFT FROM GOD

12:02.750 --> 12:04.786
FOR ALL MY GOOD DEEDS.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.549
OH, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

12:06.590 --> 12:10.219
SPENCER, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I AM NOT GONNA GLOAT

12:10.260 --> 12:11.557
ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

12:11.590 --> 12:14.491
- YESTERDAY, WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DAY IS THIS?

12:14.530 --> 12:17.363
- THE TRUCK ENDED UP STRIKING
THE DUMPSTER, FORTUNATELY,

12:17.400 --> 12:19.994
WHICH PINNED THE GIRL
BETWEEN THE GRILL AND THE WALL,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.838
BUT LEFT HER ENOUGH ROOM TO
ESCAPE WITHOUT SERIOUS INJURY.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.007
WE TALKED TO THE TRUCK DRIVER,

12:24.040 --> 12:26.099
WHO SWEARS THAT HE PUT BLOCKS
UNDER THE TIRES

12:26.140 --> 12:27.778
TO PREVENT THE TRUCK
FROM ROLLING DOWN THE ALLEY,

12:27.810 --> 12:29.004
WHICH IS ON AN INCLINE.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.177
- SO IT IS A CASE?

12:30.210 --> 12:32.917
- I CHECKED OUT THE DRIVER.
HE'S BEEN WRITTEN UP TWICE

12:32.950 --> 12:35.077
FOR FAILING TO TAKE
BASIC SAFETY PRECAUTIONS.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.179
- SO IT'S NOT A CASE?
- WE DON'T KNOW YET.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.040
THE TRUCK'S BRAKES HAVEN'T
BEEN CHECKED IN 15 YEARS.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.751
- BUT AT THIS POINT,
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

12:40.790 --> 12:41.859
- LIKE YOUR HAIR.

12:41.890 --> 12:44.085
- REALLY?
DOWN TO HAIR JOKES NOW?

12:47.430 --> 12:49.421
- THAT IS SO SWEET.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.826
LOOK HOW MUCH HE CARES FOR HER.

12:51.870 --> 12:56.068
HE'S REALLY TAKING
THIS ACCIDENT PRETTY HARD.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.631
- MY BROTHER JAY
IS A CHOREOGRAPHER,

13:00.680 --> 13:01.908
AND HE'S BEEN
TRYING TO GET THIS PLAYHOUSE

13:01.940 --> 13:03.669
TO PUT ON A BOLLYWOOD-STYLE
SHOW FOR YEARS.

13:03.710 --> 13:04.938
THERE HE IS.

13:04.980 --> 13:07.369
- COME ON, NOW.
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.069
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.
THAT'S GOOD.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.486
- MINA SAID SHE WAS COMING IN
TO REHEARSALS TODAY.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.680
I'M JUST GONNA GO CHECK ON HER,

13:12.720 --> 13:14.915
MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.050
- YOU DON'T THINK LASSITER
MAY BE RIGHT?

13:19.090 --> 13:21.024
- GUS, PLEASE.
DON'T BE HARRY POTTER

13:21.060 --> 13:22.960
AND THE PRISONER OF MARZIPAN.
- AZKABAN.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.592
- I'VE READ IT BOTH WAYS.
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.666
- OF COURSE I DON'T THINK
LASSITER'S RIGHT,

13:26.700 --> 13:27.928
BUT IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD

13:27.970 --> 13:30.734
FOR RAJ'S
WHOLE CURSE IDEA EITHER.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.939
- HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN
ALL THAT JAZZ?

13:34.980 --> 13:39.804
NO? WHITE NIGHTS?
GREGORY HINES, BARYSHNIKOV?

13:39.850 --> 13:41.272
THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.288
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA REDO
THE WHOLE ROUTINE.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.311
GO WAIT IN MY DRESSING ROOM.
GO, GO, GO.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.448
- HELLO.

13:49.490 --> 13:52.129
- LAKSHMI,
SHE'S MINA'S UNDERSTUDY.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.297
EXCELLENT.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.025
- YES, SHE IS.

13:55.060 --> 13:59.190
- SO IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS CURSE?

13:59.230 --> 14:00.959
- EVERYTHING THAT GOES WRONG
IN HIS LIFE,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.467
HE BLAMES ON THE CURSE.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.468
I MEAN, IT'S A CRUTCH.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.933
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LOVE HIM LIKE A BROTHER.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.436
- HE IS YOUR BROTHER.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.369
- YEAH, BY BLOOD,
BUT HE DOESN'T LIVE

14:11.410 --> 14:13.116
IN THE SAME WORLD
AS THE REST OF US.

14:13.150 --> 14:15.778
HE LIVES IN A WORLD
OF MAGIC AND GOBLINS,

14:15.820 --> 14:19.415
AND WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO
IS STEP INTO REALITY, OKAY?

14:19.450 --> 14:21.088
UP!

14:21.120 --> 14:22.417
TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.985
I'M GETTING MARRIED IN A MONTH,
AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

14:25.030 --> 14:27.396
A REASONABLE PERSON
AS MY BEST MAN.

14:27.430 --> 14:32.527
HE BELIEVES IN YOU, PSYCHIC,
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.391
- THAT BUTTERFLY
WAS RIGHT, GUS.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.034
RAJ IS A GUY THAT JUST NEEDS
TO GET OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.901
I MEAN, EVERYTHING BAD
THAT HAPPENS TO HIM,

14:39.940 --> 14:42.500
HE INTERPRETS AS SOME SORT
OF DIVINE INTERVENTION.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.041
IT'S A SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.945
- SO HOW DO WE BREAK HIM
OUT OF THE PATTERN?

14:45.980 --> 14:48.915
- WELL, APPARENTLY HE BELIEVES
IN ME, SO I WILL LIFT HIS CURSE,

14:48.950 --> 14:51.544
AND YOU WILL BE
MY SPECIAL HELPER.

14:53.490 --> 14:57.426
- OH, CURSED GIRLFRIEND-RUINER,
BE GONE.

14:57.460 --> 14:59.758
- THIS SEEMS DANGEROUS.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.997
- SHH. YOU'RE NOT LETTING
THE CURSE LEAVE YOUR BODY.

15:02.030 --> 15:03.725
- HE'S RIGHT.
YOU COULD ELECTROCUTE HIM.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.123
- REALLY?
- HIS HAND IS IN WATER.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.092
- YOU TELL ME THAT NOW.
YOU SAW WHAT I WAS DOING.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.461
- [hushed bickering]

15:09.500 --> 15:12.970
- ROGER, REPEAT AFTER ME.

15:13.010 --> 15:16.275
"I AM NOT CURSED.
IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD."

15:16.310 --> 15:17.743
- BUT IT'S NOT ALL IN MY HEAD.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.577
- YOU HAVE TO SAY IT
IN ORDER TO BELIEVE IT.

15:19.610 --> 15:20.611
LET ME DO THE REST.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.289
GUS, WHO IS
THE PROFESSIONAL HERE?
- YOU?

15:23.320 --> 15:25.641
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.087
- I AM NOT CURSED.
IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.850
- HMM, YES.
I'M FEELING IT.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.959
- REALLY?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.093
- YES. GUS, GET ME
THE HEDGE CLIPPERS.

15:35.130 --> 15:38.065
- I GUESS I AM FEELING
SOMETHING. IT'S TINGLING.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.965
- THAT'S THE ELECTRICAL BREAKER
SHORTING OUT.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.399
- WHAT?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.203
- IT'S SHORTING OUT, SHAWN.
HIS HAND'S IN WATER.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.764
- SHAWN?
ARE YOU HERE?

15:44.810 --> 15:47.335
GIVE ME A HAND,
I GOT SOME GROCERIES HERE.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.029
- HALLELUJAH,
THE CURSE IS BROKEN.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.445
- WHAT?
- ALL GONE. GET YOUR COAT.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.448
- BROKEN?
- ALL BROKEN.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.539
- OKAY, LET'S GET OUT THE HOUSE
BEFORE IT FINDS YOU AGAIN.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.083
- ALL GONE.
YOU'RE CURSE-FREE.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.182
- SHAWN.
- WHOA.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.324
- SHAWN, WHAT--WHAT THE HELL?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.987
WHAT IS THIS,
SMOKE IN MY LIVING ROOM?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.019
- SHH, DAD, IT'S NOT SMOKE.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.527
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE DRY ICE, OKAY?

16:07.560 --> 16:08.857
WE'RE HELPING
A VERY NICE CLIENT

16:08.900 --> 16:10.322
BY FREEING HIM OF THE FEELINGS
THAT HE MIGHT BE CURSED.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.860
- WELL, IS THIS THE GUY
THAT'S GOT THE GIRLFRIENDS

16:11.900 --> 16:13.231
THAT KEEP DROPPING LIKE FLIES?

16:13.270 --> 16:14.692
- ONE GIRL
THAT WE KNOW OF FOR SURE.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.867
SHE KIND OF, SORT OF, ALMOST
GOT CRUSHED BY A RUNAWAY TRUCK,

16:16.900 --> 16:18.333
BUT SHE'S FINE, RELATIVELY.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.837
- DID YOU TALK TO HER?
- I DIDN'T NEED TO.

16:19.870 --> 16:22.236
SHE'S NOT GONNA CRUSH HERSELF,
NOW, IS SHE?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.702
[chuckles]
- [chuckles] SMART-ASS.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.206
ALL RIGHT,
JUST CLEAN UP THIS CRAP.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.877
- TEN-FOUR.

16:26.910 --> 16:30.209
THAT'S ME, CLEANING MACHINE.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.199
- [clicks tongue]
RAJ.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.891
[sighs]

16:42.930 --> 16:44.864
WOW.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.698
[laughing]

16:47.740 --> 16:49.628
YOU SEEM DIFFERENT.

16:49.670 --> 16:52.662
[laughing]

16:57.010 --> 16:58.944
- OW! WHAT?

16:58.980 --> 17:01.710
- AREN'T YOU GONNA INTRODUCE ME
TO YOUR, UM--

17:01.750 --> 17:02.876
WHOEVER THEY ARE?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.388
- THAT'S, UH, SHAWN
AND, UM, GREG.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.513
AND THEY HELPED ME OUT

17:07.560 --> 17:09.983
WITH A PROBLEM EARLIER,
AND I OWE THEM.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.124
CAN YOU HOOK MY FRIENDS UP

17:12.160 --> 17:15.152
WITH TWO TICKETS
FOR TONIGHT'S PERFORMANCE?

17:17.400 --> 17:19.288
[cheers and applause]

17:19.330 --> 17:22.390
[traditional Indian music]

17:22.440 --> 17:28.436
*

17:36.720 --> 17:38.711
- STANDING ROOM,
BACK OF THE THEATER--

17:38.750 --> 17:41.310
SOME REWARD.
- COME ON, GREG.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.850
LET'S JUST CONGRATULATE
EACH OTHER

17:42.890 --> 17:46.587
ON A JOB WELL DONE AND ENJOY
THIS EXPLOSION OF CULTURE.

17:49.730 --> 17:51.368
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.027
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- [scoffs]

17:53.070 --> 17:55.766
- JUST CELEBRATING ANOTHER
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO A CASE.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.767
- IN RECORD TIME.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.563
- WHAT?
- REALLY?

17:58.610 --> 18:01.636
WELL, THEN YOU KNOW
THAT THE BRAKE LINES

18:01.680 --> 18:02.874
ON THE TRUCK WERE SEVERED?

18:02.910 --> 18:04.775
- LOOK, LASSIE,
THAT TRUCK WAS VERY OLD.

18:04.810 --> 18:07.278
PARTS CAN SNAP AT ANY TIME.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.072
- YOU ALSO KNOW, THEN,
THAT THE SAFETY BLOCKS

18:09.120 --> 18:11.281
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
UNDER THE TIRES

18:11.320 --> 18:13.288
WERE FOUND IN THE DUMPSTER.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.117
- MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE DONE
SOME ACTUAL INVESTIGATING.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.115
- YOU THINK?

18:16.160 --> 18:17.582
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.757
- NOTHING.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.849
I JUST MIGHT NEED TO GO
UP THERE.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.128
- WHAT?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.922
NO, SHAWN, YOU DO NOT GO UP
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

18:24.970 --> 18:26.790
- I THINK WE MADE
A HUGE MISTAKE.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.263
- I DON'T CARE.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.734
- NO!
- SHAWN! SHAWN, STOP IT!

18:30.770 --> 18:33.534
- LET GO!
- DON'T GO BONELESS ON ME, SHA--

18:33.580 --> 18:34.638
OW, MY BACK!

18:34.680 --> 18:37.979
SHAWN! SHAWN!
- AH!

18:48.560 --> 18:50.016
[cracking]

18:50.060 --> 18:51.049
-AAH!

18:58.300 --> 18:59.426
- I GOT YOU.

18:59.470 --> 19:01.665
[grunts]

19:03.140 --> 19:07.531
[exhales deeply,
breathing heavily]

19:07.580 --> 19:09.707
- I TOLD YOU IT WAS A CURSE.

19:19.350 --> 19:20.783
- DID YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS

19:20.820 --> 19:22.788
AROUND THEthTAGE TODAY?

19:22.820 --> 19:24.458
- AND YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE
THAT'S BEEN THREATENING YOU?

19:24.490 --> 19:26.958
- NO. NO ONE.
- DON'T YOU WORRY, MISS.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.799
I'M GONNA FIND
THE PERSON WHO DID THIS.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.128
I'M DONE.
YOU CAN TAKE HER.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.889
- RAJ, WILL YOU MEET ME
AT THE HOSPITAL?

19:33.940 --> 19:37.467
- NO, I CAN'T.
I HAVE TO GO.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.637
- GO WHERE?
I NEED YOU.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.309
- LOOK, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

19:42.340 --> 19:45.969
I AM SO SORRY...

19:46.010 --> 19:48.376
FOR EVERYTHING.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.412
- RAJ, COME BACK! RAJ!

19:53.690 --> 19:55.385
- THEY'RE TAKING MINA
TO THE HOSPITAL FOR X-RAYS.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.614
I'M GONNA HAVE SOME UNIFORMS
STAY WITH HER,

19:56.660 --> 19:58.025
THEN TAKE HER HOME.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.290
- WE SHOULD SEND A UNIT
TO SECURE HER RESIDENCE AS WELL.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.627
UM, SHAWN?

20:01.660 --> 20:03.719
YOU KNOW, THIS LADDER
IS REALLY BUILT FOR ONE.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.796
- OH, JULES, LOTS OF THINGS SAY
THEY'RE BUILT FOR ONE,

20:06.830 --> 20:08.969
BUT CAN EASILY FIT TWO PEOPLE.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.561
TANNING BEDS, IRON LUNG--
THAT'S JUST TO NAME TWO.

20:12.610 --> 20:13.736
- SPENCER,
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

20:13.780 --> 20:16.578
I-I THOUGHT YOU SOLVED
THIS CASE HOURS AGO.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.270
- WOW. LASSITER'S REALLY GOT
YOUR GOAT, HUH?

20:22.320 --> 20:24.811
- YEAH, HE DOES,
AND I WANT IT BACK.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.579
GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING
TO THAT POOR THING.

20:26.620 --> 20:30.454
- YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
IN LOVE CURSES, DO YOU?

20:30.490 --> 20:31.787
- JULES, I'M A PSYCHIC.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.628
I HAVE TO REMAIN OPEN
TO ANY NUMBER OF--

20:34.660 --> 20:36.890
WHY, DO YOU?

20:36.930 --> 20:40.331
- WELL, I THINK THAT EVERYBODY
WHO'S LOOKING FOR A SOUL MATE

20:40.370 --> 20:42.930
MAY, AT ONE TIME, FEEL
THAT THERE ARE OUTSIDE FORCES

20:42.970 --> 20:45.063
CONSPIRING AGAINST THEM,

20:45.110 --> 20:47.305
BUT...

20:47.340 --> 20:49.228
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:51.410 --> 20:54.208
- IT WASN'T A CURSE...

20:54.250 --> 20:56.115
NOT THIS TIME.

20:56.150 --> 20:57.481
PLASTIC.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.647
THAT WASN'T GONNA HOLD MINA
FOR LONG, NOW, WAS IT?

20:59.690 --> 21:02.784
- SNAPPED IN TWO
AND PAINTED TO LOOK LIKE METAL.

21:02.820 --> 21:03.980
- THIS MEANS WE'RE LOOKING

21:04.030 --> 21:06.157
FOR A REAL FLESH AND BLOOD
HUMAN BEING

21:06.190 --> 21:08.158
OR A GENETICALLY
ENHANCED MONKEY.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.293
EITHER WAY, SOMEONE WANTED
TO HURT THIS GIRL.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.127
- I'LL HAVE FORENSICS SEE
WHAT THEY CAN GET OFF OF THESE.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.797
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.432
- WHY?
- BECAUSE THERE WERE, LIKE,

21:15.470 --> 21:17.461
15 BACKUP DANCERS
UP HERE, RIGHT?

21:17.510 --> 21:19.137
I MEAN, HOW WOULD
THE PERPETRATOR KNOW

21:19.170 --> 21:20.478
THAT THIS TRAPDOOR
WOULD GIVE WAY

21:20.510 --> 21:23.308
AT THE PRECISE MOMENT
THAT MINA DANCED ACROSS IT?

21:27.380 --> 21:28.608
- WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

21:28.650 --> 21:30.015
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING TO A MOVIE.

21:30.050 --> 21:31.142
- YES, MOVIE, LATER.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.919
BUT FIRST,
GUS AND I NEED TO KNOCK OFF

21:32.950 --> 21:34.656
SOME QUICK CASE BUSINESS.

21:37.590 --> 21:41.026
HEY!
- YOU!

21:41.060 --> 21:42.459
[door slams]

21:42.500 --> 21:45.162
- HE MUST'VE MISTAKEN US
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.338
HEY!
- GO AWAY, SHAWN!

21:50.370 --> 21:51.405
[door slams]

21:51.440 --> 21:52.930
- I WONDER
HOW MANY SHAWNS HE KNOWS.

21:52.970 --> 21:54.232
I SHOULD DOUBLE-CHECK.

21:56.410 --> 21:58.970
- YOU ARE A FRAUD!

21:59.010 --> 22:00.511
- DUDE, IF YOU DON'T LET US IN,

22:00.550 --> 22:02.438
WE'RE GONNA BREAK
THROUGH YOUR WINDOW.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.811
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.738
WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO
COULD'VE WANTED TO HURT MINA.

22:05.790 --> 22:07.553
- FINE.

22:07.590 --> 22:10.388
- IT'S OKAY.
FINE.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.456
- CURSE BREAKER?
YOU RIDICULE ME?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.094
MY HAND IN A BOWL OF WATER?
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN MINA KILLED.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.462
- THE REASON THE CEREMONY
DIDN'T WORK, RAJ,

22:18.500 --> 22:19.728
IS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT CURSED.

22:19.770 --> 22:22.034
IT WAS SABOTAGE,
AND I KNOW THIS.

22:22.070 --> 22:23.401
- AND HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

22:23.440 --> 22:25.135
- BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO TRAVEL

22:25.170 --> 22:27.309
IN THESE SORT OF
METAPHYSICAL ARENAS, DUDE.

22:27.340 --> 22:28.568
AS SURE AS I AM

22:28.610 --> 22:30.578
THAT GUS WILL ACCIDENTALLY
CAUSE HIS OWN DEATH...

22:30.610 --> 22:32.077
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT CURSED.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.078
NOW, WE NEED TO TALK
TO YOU AND MINA.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.417
IS SHE HERE OR WHAT?

22:35.450 --> 22:37.589
- RAJESH.
WHO'S OUT THERE?

22:37.620 --> 22:39.713
- COME ON.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.757
- WONDERFUL.
MORE MOUTHS TO FEED.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.951
THANK YOU
FOR THE ADVANCE NOTICE.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.752
- NO, WE DIDN'T COME TO EAT.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.558
- YOU KNOW, GUYS,

22:53.600 --> 22:55.693
MY GRANDMOTHER TENDS TO MAKE
HER FOOD A LITTLE SPICY.

22:55.740 --> 22:56.968
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IT EASY.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.730
- PLEASE.
I'M ONE-QUARTER JAMAICAN.

22:59.770 --> 23:01.909
- I'M ALSO ONE-QUARTER JAMAICAN.
- YOU ARE NOT!

23:01.940 --> 23:03.942
STOP TELLING PEOPLE THAT!
- MMM.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.646
- SO HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY GRANDSON JAY?

23:12.690 --> 23:15.113
- UH, WE'RE ACTUALLY
FRIENDS OF RAJ.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.857
- YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR JAY
AND SITA'S ENGAGEMENT DINNER?

23:18.890 --> 23:20.755
- UH, WE'RE HELPING RAJ
WITH A PROBLEM.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.564
I'M SORRY, WAS THIS CHICKEN
SEASONED WITH MOLTEN LAVA?

23:24.830 --> 23:28.368
- SORRY ABOUT THAT--
WEDDING STUFF.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.130
HI, I'M SITA.
- HI.

23:31.170 --> 23:33.058
- DID YOU GET THE MANGO LEAVES?

23:34.110 --> 23:35.532
- NO, THEY'RE NOT IN SEASON.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.447
- HOW CAN WE HAVE A WEDDING
WITHOUT MANGO LEAVES?

23:38.480 --> 23:40.812
VERY INAUSPICIOUS.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.215
- WELL, WE COULD PUSH
THE WEDDING DATE,

23:42.250 --> 23:43.444
IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU.

23:43.490 --> 23:47.608
- AGAIN? HOW MANY TIMES
ARE WE GONNA DO THIS?

23:47.660 --> 23:49.810
- UNTIL IT'S RIGHT.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.623
- BUT I ALREADY BOOKED
KAJAGOOGOO FOR THE PARTY.

23:51.660 --> 23:53.719
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE A COVER BAND?

23:53.760 --> 23:56.593
- COME ON, KID.
- DON'T WORRY, SITA.

23:56.630 --> 23:58.518
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
IT'LL BE BEAUTIFUL.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.437
- THIS WEDDING BUSINESS
IS MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH.

24:01.470 --> 24:03.461
- BETTER THAN
BEING ALONE FOREVER.

24:03.510 --> 24:06.161
- REALLY?
YOU'RE JUST FINE?

24:06.210 --> 24:08.098
- I TAUGHT ENGLISH TO CHILDREN
IN MUMBAI FOR A MONTH.

24:08.140 --> 24:09.437
THIS IS VERY AUTHENTIC.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.573
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SHAWN,
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

24:11.610 --> 24:13.942
- NO, NO, I THINK
I LIKE IT TOO MUCH.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.277
- IT'S SO AUTHENTIC.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.845
- DUDE, I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
OUT OF MY LEFT EYE.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.846
- I SEE DEAD PEOPLE.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.287
- MY GOD,
EVEN THE WATER'S SPICY.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.558
- WHO DOES THAT?

24:33.030 --> 24:35.692
[traditional Indian music]

24:37.240 --> 24:38.468
- WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

24:38.510 --> 24:40.637
- FOOTAGE FROM THE NIGHT
THAT MINA WAS ALMOST KILLED.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.772
ON THE SCREEN ON THE RIGHT

24:41.810 --> 24:43.437
IS A PERFORMANCE
FROM ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.448
- WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING
THIS FOR? WE WERE ALL THERE.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.845
WENT OVER THE STAGE
WITH A FINE-TOOTHED COMB.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.884
- JUST SOMETHING THAT SHAWN SAID
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.356
WAIT.

24:54.390 --> 24:56.278
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

25:00.390 --> 25:03.223
- LOOKS LIKE I BETTER GET
A WARRANT.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.737
- ALL RIGHT.

25:07.770 --> 25:10.637
I'M SORRY, NO OFFENSE,
BUT IT'S STUPID

25:10.670 --> 25:12.433
THAT YOU PEOPLE
EAT FOOD THIS HOT.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.775
I SAID "NO OFFENSE," RIGHT?

25:16.810 --> 25:21.941
- [speaking Hindi]
- [speaking Hindi]

25:21.980 --> 25:24.517
YOU SHOULD MARRY HER.
- DADI.

25:24.550 --> 25:27.678
- [chuckles] SHE, UH--SHE'S NOT
ON TONIGHT'S MENU, SORRY.

25:27.720 --> 25:31.121
- SHE'S SO MUCH BETTER
THAN YOUR OTHER LADY FRIENDS.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.458
THERE WERE SOME REAL GEMS
AMONGST THOSE.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.924
- DADI, THOSE WERE
ALL VERY NICE PEOPLE.

25:35.960 --> 25:39.623
AND YOU FOUND ALL OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU SAID WERE STOLEN.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.535
[knock at door]

25:41.570 --> 25:44.368
- MORE UNINVITED GUESTS.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

25:44.410 --> 25:46.469
I'LL JUST GO TO MY GARDEN
AND HARVEST SOME FOOD.

25:46.510 --> 25:50.139
- OKAY, I WILL GET THAT.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.640
[door closes]
- SPENCER, EXCELLENT.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.843
I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE
TO SEE ME CLOSE YOUR CASE.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.949
WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE INSIGHT
INTO OUR PROCESS?

26:01.990 --> 26:05.357
YOU SEE, FIRST WE START BY
ASKING A FEW SIMPLE QUESTIONS.

26:05.390 --> 26:07.699
JAY, WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME

26:07.730 --> 26:09.789
WHO IS THE ONE
THAT CHANGED THE CHOREOGRAPHY

26:09.830 --> 26:12.196
SO THAT ONLY MINA DANCED
OVER THE TRAPDOOR?

26:12.230 --> 26:13.766
- WELL, OF COURSE,
I CHANGED THE CHOREOGRAPHY,

26:13.800 --> 26:15.267
BUT I HAD NO IDEA--
- AND WHO'S THE ONE

26:15.300 --> 26:17.439
THAT ORIGINALLY WANTED
MINA'S UNDERSTUDY FOR THE ROLE?

26:17.470 --> 26:18.801
- WELL, I ORIGINALLY
RECOMMENDED LAKSHMI,

26:18.840 --> 26:20.307
BUT THEN I GREW
TO APPRECIATE MINA,

26:20.340 --> 26:22.228
ESPECIALLY AFTER SHE
AND RAJ STARTED--

26:22.280 --> 26:24.009
- UH, SHAWN,
YOU HAVE TO STOP HIM.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.938
- NO, I'M SORRY, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA BE POSSIBLE.

26:25.980 --> 26:28.175
YOU SEE, MY PARTNER'S ALREADY
SEARCHING HIS APARTMENT

26:28.220 --> 26:31.314
AS WE SPEAK, AND GUESS WHAT
SHE ALREADY FOUND?

26:31.350 --> 26:33.318
TURNS OUT
JAY'S THE ONE THAT RENTED

26:33.350 --> 26:35.784
AND HAD ACCESS TO THE TRUCK
THAT ALMOST KILLED MINA.

26:37.790 --> 26:40.350
JAWAHARLAL SINGH, STAND UP,
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.994
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.066
STAND UP.
- WHAT?

26:45.330 --> 26:47.025
- LET'S GO, TOUGH GUY.

26:47.070 --> 26:48.697
- LASSIE, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.594
YOU'RE WAY, WAY OFF BASE.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.959
- SPENCER,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:52.010 --> 26:54.001
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GAVE US
THE CHOREOGRAPHY LEAD.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.530
THANK YOU FOR THAT,
BY THE WAY.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.575
- COME ON, COME ON!

27:01.620 --> 27:05.112
- BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET
MARRIED IN A MONTH.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.414
- YOU'RE DESTROYING MY FAMILY.

27:11.660 --> 27:13.127
[door slams]

27:13.160 --> 27:15.628
- SO YOU CAME HEEE TO HELP RAJ.

27:15.660 --> 27:17.059
- BUT INSTEAD
YOU GOT HIS BROTHER ARRESTED

27:17.100 --> 27:19.364
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER.
- THAT'S CORRECT.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.129
- BUSINESS AS USUAL?

27:21.170 --> 27:23.764
- IT'S A PROCESS.

27:29.410 --> 27:31.901
- I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING, OKAY?

27:31.950 --> 27:33.747
DON'T CRY.
WE'LL SORT IT OUT.

27:34.850 --> 27:35.817
- HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

27:35.850 --> 27:37.340
- YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

27:37.380 --> 27:39.348
YOU'VE RIDICULED MY CURSE
AND MY BELIEFS,

27:39.390 --> 27:41.312
AND NOW IT'S AFFECTING
EVERYONE I LOVE.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.351
FIRST IT WAS MINA,
THEN MY BROTHER,

27:43.390 --> 27:46.154
AND NOW SITA,
WHO'S LIKE A SISTER TO ME.

27:46.190 --> 27:47.589
- LOOK, RAJ, I CAN FIX THIS.

27:47.630 --> 27:49.495
- SHAWN, THE CASE THEY HAVE
AGAINST JAY IS PRETTY STRONG.

27:49.530 --> 27:50.929
THEY HAVE MOTIVE, MEANS,
OPPORTUNITY.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.164
THE ONLY THING THEY DON'T HAVE

27:52.200 --> 27:53.690
IS AN ACTUAL VIDEO
OF HIM COMMITTING THE CRIME.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.163
- WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN FIND THAT
FOR THE COPS TOO, SHAWN.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.963
- LEAVE US ALL ALONE.
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.308
- OKAY, STOP IT, RAJ.

28:00.340 --> 28:03.002
JUST STOP.
THERE IS NO CURSE.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.598
SOMEONE IS DOING THIS TO YOU.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.902
- REALLY?
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

28:06.950 --> 28:09.612
WHAT HAPPENED TO GITA, RAINI,
DIPTI, AND VICTORIA, HUH?

28:09.650 --> 28:12.619
- HE'S LIKE A PUMA.
- WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.049
- HOW'D HE GET UP ON US
SO FAST?

28:14.090 --> 28:15.887
- I DON'T KNOW. I BLINKED,
AND HE WAS RIGHT THERE.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.319
- HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.124
WE SHOULD TALK TO GILA,
RAY JAY, AND DIPSTICK.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.651
- WOW, YOU KNOW THOSE NAMES
WERE NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE, RIGHT?

28:22.700 --> 28:25.999
- IT ALL STARTED
WITH THE BREAK-IN AT MY CONDO.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.294
- AND THEN A CAR ACCIDENT.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.638
- NEXT THING I KNEW,
MY APARTMENT WAS ON FIRE.

28:30.670 --> 28:34.106
- WE TALKED ABOUT MOVING IN
TOGETHER, RIGHT BEFORE IT ENDED.

28:34.140 --> 28:35.835
- I MET HIS FAMILY ON FRIDAY,

28:35.880 --> 28:38.974
AND BY THE NEXT WEEKEND,
IT WAS OVER.

28:39.010 --> 28:42.138
HE SEEMED REALLY SAD
TO CALL IT OFF.

28:42.180 --> 28:45.081
- RIGHT WHEN THINGS WERE BEST,
I THOUGHT HE WAS THE ONE.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.314
I HAD THAT ACCIDENT.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.113
THEN HE SAID
WE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.822
- ARE YOU AS JEALOUS
OF THIS GUY AS I AM?

28:50.860 --> 28:52.327
- MORE...

28:52.360 --> 28:54.692
EXCEPT FOR THE PARTS WHERE
HIS GIRLFRIENDS ALMOST DIE.

28:54.730 --> 28:55.856
- RIGHT.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.334
- THEY'RE RELEASING MY BROTHER,
NO THANKS TO YOU.

29:04.370 --> 29:05.906
- ACTUALLY, ALL THANKS TO ME.

29:05.940 --> 29:07.874
I'M THE ONE
THAT LINED UP HIS ALIBI

29:07.910 --> 29:09.002
WITH THE TIMELINE OF THE CRIME.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.735
I'M THE ONE
THAT FOUND TWO WITNESSES

29:10.780 --> 29:12.998
THAT PUT HIM SOMEPLACE ELSE
WHEN THE SABOTAGE OCCURRED.

29:13.050 --> 29:15.712
AND I AM THE ONE THAT GOT HIM
ARRESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.672
- THAT LAST ONE DIDN'T PLAY.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.712
- YEAH, JUST SCRATCH
THE LAST ONE, OKAY?

29:20.750 --> 29:22.456
WE SPOKE
TO YOUR OTHER GIRLFRIENDS.

29:22.490 --> 29:25.186
- AND WE HAVE CONCLUDED
THAT THEY WERE ALL KIND OF HOT.

29:25.230 --> 29:26.720
- THAT'S TRUE.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.819
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
THERE'S A PATTERN HERE.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.862
THIS PERSON,
WHOEVER'S OUT TO GET YOU,

29:30.900 --> 29:32.993
ONLY STRIKES WHEN YOU GET
SERIOUS WITH SOMEONE.

29:33.030 --> 29:34.463
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.831
- FIRST OF ALL, IT MEANS
IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW.

29:35.870 --> 29:37.064
- OR KNOWS YOU,
AND THEY ONLY ATTACK

29:37.100 --> 29:38.408
WHEN YOU'VE
COMMITTED TO SOMEONE.

29:38.440 --> 29:41.136
- I'VE DEVISED A PLAN
TO DRAW OUT THE ATTACKER.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.329
WE JUST NEED MINA--

29:42.380 --> 29:44.769
- I NEED TO STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

29:44.810 --> 29:45.879
MINA'S GONE.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.310
- WHAT?
YOU DIDN'T KILL HER, DID YOU?

29:48.350 --> 29:51.547
- GUS, PLEASE, SOME DECORUM.
YOU DIDN'T, RIGHT?

29:51.590 --> 29:55.378
- NO! I PUT HER ON A PLANE.
I BROKE IT OFF WITH HER.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.854
MAYBE I WAS JUST
MEANT TO BE ALONE.

29:57.890 --> 30:00.188
- WOW. YOU WOULD
RATHER LOSE HER

30:00.230 --> 30:01.959
THAN SEE THE POSSIBILITY
OF HARM COME TO HER.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.353
YOU LOVE HER THAT MUCH?

30:03.400 --> 30:05.163
- I DON'T KNOW
ANY OTHER WAY TO LOVE.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.327
- REALLY?
HAVE YOU SEEN 9 1/2 WEEKS?

30:07.370 --> 30:08.496
- SHAWN.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.235
- OR ANY OF ZALMAN KING'S
OTHER STUFF?

30:10.270 --> 30:12.238
- SHAWN.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

30:12.270 --> 30:14.579
- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT NOW.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.168
- WE WERE GOING TO DANGLE MINA
OUT IN THE OPEN

30:17.640 --> 30:19.346
- YOU WERE GONNA MAKE
THE WOMAN I LOVE,

30:19.380 --> 30:21.041
THE WOMAN I WOULD GIVE
MY LIFE FOR--

30:21.080 --> 30:22.377
YOU WERE GONNA MAKE HER BAIT?

30:22.420 --> 30:26.208
- BAIT?
THAT'S A STRONG FISHING TERM.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.310
NO, WE WERE GONNA MAKE HER
AN INCENTIVE,

30:29.360 --> 30:31.487
SINCE THE ATTACKER'S
ONLY PATTERN

30:31.530 --> 30:34.454
IS TO KEEP YOU
FROM FINDING LOVE.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.024
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

30:42.200 --> 30:46.159
- MAN, I DON'T LIKE THIS.

30:46.210 --> 30:48.098
- YOU DON'T LIKE JULIA
DATING SOMEBODY.

30:48.140 --> 30:51.200
- FAKE DATING,
BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.117
IT'S THIS WHOLE
"USING HER AS BAIT" THING.

30:54.150 --> 30:55.219
- YOU HAD NO PROBLEM

30:55.250 --> 30:56.774
DANGLING HIS GIRLFRIEND
OUT THERE AS BAIT.

30:56.820 --> 30:59.311
- WELL, NOW YOU'RE CHANGING
THE RULES, AREN'T YOU?

30:59.350 --> 31:00.817
LOOK AT RAJ.

31:00.850 --> 31:03.489
HE'S GETTING AWFULLY "HANDSY"
OVER THERE,

31:03.520 --> 31:06.318
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF THE SITUATION LIKE THAT.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.827
- [Lassiter on radio]
NO, HE'S DEFINITELY BUGGED

31:07.860 --> 31:09.350
BY O'HARA DATING THIS GUY.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.863
- GUS, DON'T LEAVE
THE TALK BUTTON ON.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.237
- THAT WAS SO GOOD.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.009
- I'VE NEVER HAD BROCCOLI
IN A MILKSHAKE BEFORE.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.473
- [laughing]
I KNOW.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.671
BUT JUST THINK
HOW GOOD IT IS FOR YOU.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.873
- WELL, WELL, WELL.
IT'S 11:20.

31:29.920 --> 31:32.741
LOOK WHO FINALLY DECIDED
TO COME HOME.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.759
- I'M SORRY, SHAWN.
ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING?

31:35.790 --> 31:38.827
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I AM--RAJ.

31:38.860 --> 31:40.452
- WHAT DID I DO?

31:40.490 --> 31:41.821
- LOOK, I DIDN'T LIKE THIS IDEA
TO BEGIN WITH.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.157
YOU'VE BEEN ON
FOUR DATES NOW.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.065
IT'S BEEN A COMPLETE
AND TOTAL FAILURE.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.193
- NO, SHAWN,
WE'VE BEEN ON THREE DATES.

31:47.230 --> 31:48.492
- NO, THERE WAS THE CARNIVAL,

31:48.540 --> 31:50.189
WHERE RAJ WON YOU
A BIG, FAT STUFFED OCT OPUS.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.707
THERE WAS A LONG WALK
ON THE PIER,

31:51.740 --> 31:53.867
WHERE HE KEPT BRUSHING YOUR HAIR
GENTLY OUT OF YOUR FACE.

31:53.910 --> 31:55.275
THEN THERE WAS DINNER TONIGHT,

31:55.310 --> 31:56.971
WHERE THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT
OF HAND-HOLDING.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.898
AND WHO COULD FORGET COFFEE
AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

31:58.950 --> 32:01.316
WHERE YOU BLUSHED
AND SQUEALED AND GIGGLED

32:01.350 --> 32:02.715
LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL?

32:02.750 --> 32:04.479
- THAT WAS NOT A DATE. HE WAS
THERE TO SIGN SOME PAPERS.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.544
YOU WERE WATCHING US?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.478
- IT'S CALLED SURVEILLANCE.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.987
I "SURVEILLATE" THINGS.

32:09.020 --> 32:10.715
I'M A PURVEYOR
OF "SURVEILLERISM."

32:10.760 --> 32:12.580
LET'S NOT GET CAUGHT UP
IN WORDPLAY.

32:12.630 --> 32:13.881
THE POINT IS,

32:13.930 --> 32:15.659
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS LITTLE
CHARADE FOR THREE WEEKS,

32:15.700 --> 32:17.452
AND IT'S YIELDED
A GRAND TOTAL OF NADA.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.467
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.388
- OF COURSE I AM.
YOU SEE THAT?

32:20.430 --> 32:22.136
- LOOK, IT'S CLEAR
THAT THE KILLER

32:22.170 --> 32:24.206
DOESN'T THINK DETECTIVE O'HARA
IS MY GIRLFRIEND,

32:24.240 --> 32:26.128
OR MAYBE THEY KNOW
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH MINA.

32:26.170 --> 32:28.104
WE CAN KEEP AT THIS
FOR SIX MONTHS,

32:28.140 --> 32:29.676
WE'RE STILL NOT GONNA GET
ANYWHERE.

32:29.710 --> 32:33.100
UNLESS WE DID SOMETHING TO
REMOVE ALL DOUBT, SOMETHING BIG.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.414
I MEAN, YOU SAID IT YOURSELF,
THE ATTACKS ONLY HAPPEN

32:35.450 --> 32:37.873
WHEN RAJ GETS SERIOUS.
- RIGHT.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.889
- YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY'S GOING TO
THE HOLI FESTIVAL THIS WEEKEND?

32:40.920 --> 32:42.057
- YEAH.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.083
- I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.793
RAJ, YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?

32:57.300 --> 33:00.235
[upbeat music]

33:00.270 --> 33:01.635
*

33:03.280 --> 33:05.703
- SHAWN, THIS IS
SO CONSIDERATE OF YOU.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.399
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO GO TO THE HOLI FESTIVAL

33:07.450 --> 33:08.815
WHEN I WAS IN INDIA.

33:08.850 --> 33:10.078
- YES, I SENSED THAT.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.587
I'M AWARE OF YOUR IMMENSE LOVE

33:11.620 --> 33:14.418
FOR TRADITIONAL FESTIVALS
OF COLORS.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.984
THERE ALSO MIGHT BE
A KILLER HERE,

33:16.020 --> 33:17.749
AND I MAY NEED YOU TO BLOCK
AN EXIT LATER.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.280
- WHAT?

33:19.330 --> 33:22.299
- OH, FRESH LADDU.
- [gasp5]

33:24.000 --> 33:25.968
- THERE'S MRS. SINGH.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.797
SHE HATES ME,
AND PEOPLE DON'T HATE ME.

33:27.830 --> 33:29.536
I GET CHRISTMAS CARDS
FROM PEOPLE I ARREST.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.538
- SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU, OKAY?

33:31.570 --> 33:33.333
- APPARENTLY
I DON'T FIT THE PICTURE

33:33.370 --> 33:35.509
OF WHAT HER PERFECT
RAJ DESERVES.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.371
I AM SMART, AND I AM FUN,

33:37.410 --> 33:39.275
AND I AM ALMOST ALWAYS
IN A GOOD MOOD, DAMN IT.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.619
- YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
MARRYING RAJ, REMEMBER?

33:41.650 --> 33:44.084
LET'S JUST GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD, OKAY?

33:44.120 --> 33:45.917
PLEASE.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.388
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

33:49.420 --> 33:51.923
I SEE THAT A LOT OF MY FAMILY
ARE HERE TODAY,

33:51.960 --> 33:54.895
AND, UH, I WANTED TO SHARE
SOME GREAT NEWS WITH YOU.

33:54.930 --> 33:58.195
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD
SOME TRYING TIMES LATELY.

33:58.230 --> 34:01.267
I LOST A LOVE
THAT I THOUGHT WAS TRUE

34:01.300 --> 34:04.235
AND, UM, HAD SOME TROUBLE
WITHIN MY FAMILY,

34:04.270 --> 34:06.761
BUT THIS WOMAN HERE,

34:06.810 --> 34:10.029
THIS BEAUTIFUL ANGEL
HAS BEEN MY SAVIOR,

34:10.080 --> 34:13.572
AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF YOU
WILL THINK IT'S CRAZY,

34:13.610 --> 34:16.511
AND IT MAY BE IMPULSIVE,

34:16.550 --> 34:21.283
BUT I'VE ASKED MY BEAUTIFUL
JULIET TO MARRY ME,

34:21.320 --> 34:23.083
AND SHE ACCEPTED.

34:23.120 --> 34:27.580
[cheers and applause]

34:27.630 --> 34:31.259
- ALL RIGHT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY BOUGHT IT.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.188
- NOW WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

34:33.230 --> 34:35.164
- AND WATCH.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.608
- IS IT TOO EARLY FOR A SNACK?

34:40.640 --> 34:42.608
- WE'VE BEEN HERE FIVE MINUTES.
- I KNOW.

34:42.640 --> 34:45.404
- SPENCER.
ALL RIGHT, I ADMIT IT.

34:45.450 --> 34:47.077
I WAS WRONG ABOUT THE BROTHER.

34:47.110 --> 34:48.441
I THINK WE SHOULD CALL A TRUCE.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.641
- THAT'S AWFULLY BIG
OF YOU, LASSIE.

34:50.680 --> 34:53.581
- DETECTIVE,
MIGHT I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?

34:53.620 --> 34:56.350
- WHAT CAN I DO FO--
WAIT A MINUTE.

34:56.390 --> 34:57.914
YOU'RE THE GUY
FROM THE THEATER, RIGHT?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.427
- I'M AFRAID
I DIDN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING

34:59.460 --> 35:01.257
THE DAY YOU QUESTIONED ME.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.427
YOU KNOW ON THAT NIGHT
JUST BEFORE THE ACCIDENT,

35:03.460 --> 35:06.668
I OVERHEARD MINA
AND THE RAJ GUY TALKING...

35:06.700 --> 35:09.498
- I HATE HAVING TO HIDE
WHAT WE HAVE.

35:09.540 --> 35:13.465
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T REALLY BE
TOGETHER UNTIL YOU TELL HER.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.774
- I WILL. SOON.

35:15.810 --> 35:17.903
- HE WAS SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.749
MINA WAS GOING TO EXPOSE
THE AFFAIR,

35:19.780 --> 35:21.577
GIVING RAJ MOTIVE FOR MURDER.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.418
HE WASN'T DISTRAUGHT BECAUSE HE
ALMOST LOST HIS GIRLFRIEND.

35:24.450 --> 35:26.088
IT WAS GUILT
OVER TRYING TO KILL HER.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.816
HIS FIRST CONFESSION WAS REAL.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.919
WHO, EXACTLY, IS RESPONSIBLE?

35:30.960 --> 35:32.928
- I AM.
I HURT THEM ALL.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.894
I'M A DANGER
TO EVERYONE AROUND ME.

35:34.930 --> 35:37.353
- I SOLVED IT.
IT WAS RAJ. TRUCE OVER.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.027
- YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK
A TRUCE, LASSIE.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.162
- YOU COMING WITH ME OR NOT?

35:40.200 --> 35:42.088
- NO! RAJ WOULDN'T CHEAT
ON HIS TAXES,

35:42.140 --> 35:43.459
MUCH LESS HIS GIRLFRIEND.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.161
- I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.601
- GUS, TELL HIM,
YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK A TRUCE.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.143
INDIAN GIVER!

35:53.810 --> 35:56.916
[laughs]
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

35:56.950 --> 36:01.489
I-I MEANT TO INSULT AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT GROUP OF INDIANS.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.509
SORRY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.824
- SHAWN,
YOU CAN'T ENDANGER JULIET

36:04.860 --> 36:06.282
OVER A GRIPE WITH LASSITER.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.696
- I'M NOT. YOU HEARD THE DUDE
FROM TEMPLE OF DOOM.

36:08.730 --> 36:11.460
RAJ WAS HIDING HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH MINA, BUT FROM WHO?

36:11.500 --> 36:13.968
THAT'S WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
OH, NO.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.934
AND LASSITER'S FOLLOWING RAJ,
WHO DIDN'T DO IT.

36:15.970 --> 36:19.360
THEN WHO EXACTLY
IS WATCHING JULES?

36:23.410 --> 36:24.968
THERE!

36:28.450 --> 36:30.213
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S JULIET?

36:30.250 --> 36:33.845
- I GOT HIT FROM BEHIND.
NEXT THING I KNEW, SHE WAS GONE.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.357
- DID YOU SEE WHO HIT YOU?

36:35.390 --> 36:36.982
- NO, IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.954
- ARE YOU OKAY? DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL AN AMBULANCE?

36:38.990 --> 36:40.958
- NO, I'M FINE, REALLY.
- SPREAD OUT, EVERYBODY.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.924
I WANT EYES ON MY PARTNER
IN FIVE MINUTES.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.497
- YOU, TAKE A BREAK.
HAVE A SWEET BALL.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.758
JULIET!

36:49.800 --> 36:50.767
JULES!

36:50.800 --> 36:52.461
- EXCUSE ME.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.974
JULES!
- JULIET!

36:56.010 --> 36:57.773
JULES!

36:57.810 --> 37:00.199
JULIET!

37:01.850 --> 37:03.841
- JULES!

37:06.120 --> 37:07.439
- THERE!

37:11.890 --> 37:13.050
JULES!

37:15.900 --> 37:17.424
OKAY.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.018
IT'S--IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, SITA.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.219
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

37:20.270 --> 37:21.589
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.369
- YOU DO?
- OF COURSE I DO, GUS.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.958
- SHUT UP!
AND DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.433
- I CAN SEE--I CAN SEE IT ALL.

37:27.470 --> 37:28.937
YOU--YOU MET JAY.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.402
HE PROPOSED.
YOU ACCEPTED.

37:30.440 --> 37:34.410
THEN YOU STARTING HANGING OUT
WITH THE FAMILY, MOSTLY RAJ.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.748
THAT'S WHEN YOU REALIZED

37:36.780 --> 37:39.317
YOU WERE TRULY IN LOVE
WITH RAJ,

37:39.350 --> 37:40.908
NOT YOUR FIANCE.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.451
BUT YOU WERE STUCK.

37:42.490 --> 37:43.980
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU COULD CALL OFF
THE ENGAGEMENT,

37:44.020 --> 37:45.157
MAKE A PLAY FOR RAJ.

37:45.190 --> 37:46.623
HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT
TO HIS BROTHER.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.925
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:49.960 --> 37:51.769
[coughs]

37:51.800 --> 37:53.961
REALLY, DUDE?
REALLY?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.797
WHERE WAS I?

37:55.840 --> 37:57.398
- SHE WAS STUCK.
- RIGHT.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.668
YOU WERE STUCK,

37:58.710 --> 38:01.577
ENGAGED TO ONE MAN
BUT IN LOVE WITH HIS BROTHER.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.407
SO YOU DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.579
FIRST, YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD

38:05.610 --> 38:07.043
TO DELAY YOUR WEDDING TO JAY.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.412
- WELL, WE COULD PUSH
THE WEDDING DATE,

38:09.450 --> 38:11.179
IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU.

38:11.220 --> 38:14.678
- THEN, YOU SABOTAGED
ALL OF RAJ'S RELATIONSHIPS,

38:14.720 --> 38:17.086
WAITING FOR A TIME
WHEN BOTH OF YOU WERE FREE,

38:17.120 --> 38:19.179
CONVINCING HIM
THAT HE WOULD BE BY HIMSELF

38:19.230 --> 38:20.583
FOR THE REST OF TIME,

38:20.630 --> 38:22.655
MAKING IT EASIER FOR YOU TO
SWOOP IN AT THE PERFECT MOMENT.

38:22.700 --> 38:26.124
POOR MINA,
SHE WAS THE EASIEST ONE OF ALL.

38:26.170 --> 38:27.296
NOBODY WAS GONNA QUESTION

38:27.330 --> 38:28.968
WHY YOU WERE HANGING
AROUND THE THEATER.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.161
AFTER ALL, YOU WERE ENGAGED
TO THE CHOREOGRAPHER.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.532
YOU SWING BY, YOU SAY, "HI,"

38:33.570 --> 38:36.471
AND THAT'S WHAT GRANTED YOU
ACCESS TO THE CREW'S TRUCKS.

38:36.510 --> 38:39.843
PROBABLY EVEN HAD BLUEPRINTS
AND KEYS TO THE THEATER.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.576
YOU EVEN WATCHED
THE OCCASIONAL REHEARSAL

38:42.620 --> 38:44.747
TO SEE
IF THE DANCE STEPS CHANGED.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.883
- GET BACK.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.751
I'M GONNA KILL HER.

38:48.790 --> 38:51.588
SHE CAN'T HAVE WHAT I WANT,

38:51.630 --> 38:52.927
BECAUSE HE'S MINE.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.793
ME AND RAJ,
WE'RE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.752
- LET HER GO.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.926
LET HER GO,

38:58.970 --> 39:01.859
AND ALL OF THIS
WILL BE MUCH EASIER FOR YOU.

39:01.900 --> 39:06.132
I MEAN, YOU WERE--
YOU WERE CRAZY IN LOVE.

39:06.170 --> 39:10.174
ANY FOOL COULD SEE WHAT WOULD
DRIVE YOU TO DO THIS.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.949
- [grunts]
- AAH!

39:19.450 --> 39:20.781
- OW!

39:23.060 --> 39:24.482
- WORD OF ADVICE,

39:24.530 --> 39:25.883
WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE HOSTAGE,

39:25.930 --> 39:27.329
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THEM
FOR WEAPONS.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.452
DROP THE KNIFE.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.151
DROP IT.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.929
- DID ABIGAIL SEE THAT?
- I'M RIGHT HERE.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.268
- YES, YOU ARE.
THE PAIN SURPRISED ME.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.598
AND I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GET
SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY A GIRL.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.437
- IT'S A PROCESS.

39:39.470 --> 39:42.405
- IT IS A PROCESS.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.475
- WHAT'D I MISS?

39:43.510 --> 39:44.807
- NOT ME GETTING SLAPPED
IN THE FACE.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.148
- BY A GIRL.
- 'CAUSE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

39:47.180 --> 39:50.570
- YOU'RE CAUGHT--ASSAULTING
A COP AND TONS OF WITNESSES.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.212
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
AWAY WITH THAT.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.478
[handcuffs snap]

39:55.520 --> 39:58.683
- HAVE FUN
WITH SHOCK THERAPY.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.958
- I GOT A WEDDING INVITATION
FROM RAJ AND MINA.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.194
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.265
IT FEELS GOOD--YOU KNOW,
BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER,

40:11.300 --> 40:13.109
WATCHING THEM SAIL OFF
INTO THE SUNSET,

40:13.140 --> 40:15.870
GIVING A GOOD GUY
THE OLD HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.036
I FELT FOR RAJ.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.207
END OF THE DAY,
WE HAD A GREAT DEAL IN COMMON.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.878
- YOU GONNA GO?
- NAH, I BARELY KNEW THAT DUDE.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.639
AND THIS, ABIGAIL,
IS WHERE WE END OUR TOUR,

40:24.690 --> 40:26.385
BECAUSE RIGHT HERE

40:26.420 --> 40:28.388
IS WHERE I CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSE
NOT TO GLOAT

40:28.420 --> 40:30.980
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN THE BEST
OF LASSIE.
- RIGHT HERE?

40:31.020 --> 40:35.229
- WELL, IT'S MORE ALL--ALL--
ALL-OVERISH, I GUESS.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.989
BUT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
DONE THAT,

40:37.030 --> 40:38.895
THOUGH I SUPPOSE THERE'S
A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

40:38.930 --> 40:40.795
- WELL, COLOR ME IMPRESSED.

40:40.830 --> 40:43.037
- I'D RATHER COLOR YOU WITH A
VARIETY OF EDIBLE BODY PAINTS.

40:43.070 --> 40:44.389
- DULY NOTED.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.067
- BESIDES,
IT'S NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.361
I SOLVE A CASE EVERY WEEK

40:47.410 --> 40:49.037
AND USUALLY ONE
AROUND CHRISTMAS.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.036
- IT WAS SO IMPRESSIVE

40:51.080 --> 40:53.548
THE WAY YOU JUST ATTACKED
THAT MADWOMAN WITH A KNIFE.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.571
IT SAYS SO MUCH
ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.440
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL.

40:57.480 --> 40:58.947
- HOW I FEEL?

40:58.990 --> 41:03.313
- I MEAN, YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE
FOR A RANDOM COWORKER.

41:06.590 --> 41:09.457
- SHE'S NOT RANDOM.

41:09.500 --> 41:13.061
I MEAN--WHAT I MEAN IS,
IT'S PART OF THE JOB.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.567
I MEAN, I WOULD DO THAT
FOR ANYBODY--

41:14.600 --> 41:17.694
COLLEAGUE, COWORKER,
COREY HAIM ONCE.

41:17.740 --> 41:19.207
WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN,
TO BE HONEST.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.537
NEVER GOT A THANK YOU,

41:20.570 --> 41:22.208
AND I'M PRETTY SURE HE STOLE
MY MEDIC ALERT BRACELET.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.309
- YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE?

41:23.340 --> 41:26.138
- IT'S GUS'.
LONG STORY.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.102
SO AM I FINGERPRINTING YOU
OR WHAT?

41:28.150 --> 41:31.142
IT'S FUN, BUT YOU'LL HAVE
LITTLE, BABY BLACK FINGERS

41:31.180 --> 41:32.989
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.
- NO.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.556
- O'HARA!

41:34.590 --> 41:36.455
THREE LIQUOR STORES HAVE BEEN
HIT IN THE LAST 15 MINUTES.

41:36.490 --> 41:37.650
UNITS ARE IN PURSUIT
OF THE SUSPECT S.

41:37.690 --> 41:40.056
LET'S ROLL!

41:40.090 --> 41:42.558
- GO AHEAD.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.727
- NAH, I GOT THE LAST ONE.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.397
WE'LL LET LASSIE HAVE THIS ONE.

41:46.430 --> 41:47.567
- OKAY.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.508
WANT TO DO
A FAKE MUG SHOT INSTEAD?

41:54.540 --> 41:56.701
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?

41:56.740 --> 41:58.844
YES.
WE'LL NEED COSTUMES.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.474
WHERE DID I PUT THE KEY
TO THE EVIDENCE LOCKER?

42:01.510 --> 42:03.649
THE HOLDING CELLS.
