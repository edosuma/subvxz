00:00.176 --> 00:01.942
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

00:02.033 --> 00:04.432
What do we know about
this Addison fellow himself?

00:04.476 --> 00:06.510
He's the UN Security Council's
top trouble-shooter.

00:06.512 --> 00:08.478
You've sent
the Hollow Earth Osama home

00:08.480 --> 00:10.247
to re-arm and re-group.

00:10.249 --> 00:11.382
Get out.

00:11.384 --> 00:14.053
You just signed
the Sanctuary's death warrant.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.554
My group came here
to claim this land as our own,

00:15.556 --> 00:17.155
to win back the surface

00:17.157 --> 00:18.823
from those self-entitled humans.

00:18.825 --> 00:20.057
Enough...

00:20.059 --> 00:21.324
It's a whole
new world out there.

00:21.326 --> 00:24.395
Factions of abnormals
killing each other,

00:24.397 --> 00:25.497
plotting to kill us...

00:25.499 --> 00:28.432
It's only going
to get worse, isn't it?

00:32.668 --> 00:34.269
Henry, where's
this road, man?

00:34.271 --> 00:35.837
Should be just up ahead.

00:35.839 --> 00:37.338
It should be?

00:37.340 --> 00:38.505
Come on, we're running
out of time here.

00:38.507 --> 00:39.540
Yeah, I know.

00:39.542 --> 00:40.708
Any word from Magnus?

00:40.710 --> 00:42.243
No, nothing.

00:42.245 --> 00:43.811
<i>They're both inside.</i>

00:47.116 --> 00:48.417
Damn.

00:55.826 --> 00:57.861
Henry, SCIU's got
this side locked off.

00:57.863 --> 00:58.762
We need another way around.

00:58.764 --> 01:00.464
This is the way around.

01:00.466 --> 01:02.532
We gotta run it.

01:02.534 --> 01:03.700
<i>Wait, Will!</i>

01:03.702 --> 01:04.733
H-hold on a second.

01:04.736 --> 01:05.735
<i>What time you got?</i>

01:05.737 --> 01:07.837
Son of a bitch, it's noon.

01:07.839 --> 01:09.839
Come on.

01:09.841 --> 01:13.743
Don't move!
Stop right there!

01:13.745 --> 01:15.612
Go! Go!

01:22.253 --> 01:23.386
Magnus, come in.

01:23.388 --> 01:24.454
You've got to
get out of there now--

01:28.692 --> 01:30.560
My God.

01:48.411 --> 01:50.279
Magnus, it disgusts me.

01:50.281 --> 01:51.547
It is disgusting.

01:51.549 --> 01:53.882
It's part of
their usual behavior.

01:53.884 --> 01:56.584
Some abnormals prefer
to eat in private.

01:56.586 --> 01:57.819
Others,
like the Besovites,

01:57.821 --> 01:59.654
require your complete
attention.

01:59.656 --> 02:01.156
They're exhibitionists.

02:01.158 --> 02:03.158
They smear their food
all over each other

02:03.160 --> 02:04.726
and then lick it off.

02:04.728 --> 02:05.527
It's like the <i> Animal</i>
<i>Planet</i> version

02:05.529 --> 02:07.696
of "9 1/2 weeks"!

02:07.698 --> 02:10.699
Well, I find that if you
just sit back and relax,

02:10.701 --> 02:12.835
it can actually be
quite enjoyable.

02:12.837 --> 02:15.204
Okay, stop it,
you-you are lying now.

02:15.206 --> 02:16.672
Yes, I am.

02:16.674 --> 02:18.240
What about Henry?

02:18.242 --> 02:20.576
He's in charge of
clearing out their habitat.

02:20.578 --> 02:21.710
Biggie?

02:21.712 --> 02:23.478
He's halfway to
Hollow Earth, I'm afraid.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.214
Can't you do it?

02:26.216 --> 02:27.515
Forget I said that.

02:27.517 --> 02:30.351
Oh, hey, what about
a mannequin?

02:30.353 --> 02:31.418
Will, believe me,

02:31.420 --> 02:32.953
over the years,
I have tried everything.

02:32.955 --> 02:34.688
The Besovites always know.

02:34.690 --> 02:37.290
There really is no substitute
for sitting and watching.

02:37.292 --> 02:38.625
I'll make you some popcorn--

02:38.627 --> 02:39.793
Doc!

02:39.795 --> 02:41.661
There's a call from Declan,
priority channel.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.568
Declan,
what's going on?

02:48.570 --> 02:49.903
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you,</i>
<i>but there's someone here</i>

02:49.905 --> 02:50.938
<i>who needs to speak</i>
<i>to you right away.</i>

02:54.442 --> 02:55.876
Kate!

02:55.878 --> 02:56.710
<i>Hey, Doc!</i>

02:56.712 --> 02:58.378
<i>Will, Hank.</i>

02:58.380 --> 02:59.880
It's good to see you.

02:59.882 --> 03:01.081
How's life
in the tunnels?

03:01.083 --> 03:03.516
<i>Good, but</i>
<i>something's come up.</i>

03:03.518 --> 03:04.651
<i>What's wrong?</i>

03:04.653 --> 03:05.919
Two days ago,

03:05.921 --> 03:07.820
a group of abnormals arrived
back in Hollow Earth.

03:07.822 --> 03:09.288
<i>Yes, I arranged transport</i>

03:09.290 --> 03:10.556
<i>through the Moscow</i>
<i>Sanctuary.</i>

03:10.558 --> 03:11.523
<i>Did something happen?</i>

03:11.525 --> 03:12.758
One of them came to me,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.626
a Takterran
by the name of Sephis.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.227
He said he had information

03:16.229 --> 03:18.229
about a terrorist attack
being planned on the surface.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.664
By whom?

03:19.666 --> 03:20.865
<i>Fanatic abnormals.</i>

03:20.867 --> 03:22.634
They're trying to strike
at key targets

03:22.636 --> 03:24.603
to start a human-abnormal war.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.571
Yeah, we've run into
those guys before.

03:26.573 --> 03:27.572
What's the target?

03:27.574 --> 03:28.573
<i>No idea.</i>

03:28.575 --> 03:29.841
<i>All he was</i>
<i>able to tell me</i>

03:29.843 --> 03:30.776
<i>is that it's been</i>
<i>planned for months,</i>

03:30.778 --> 03:32.377
<i>and that</i>
<i>the group behind it</i>

03:32.379 --> 03:33.578
<i>definitely has the power</i>
<i>and the connections</i>

03:33.580 --> 03:34.846
<i>to pull it off.</i>

03:34.848 --> 03:36.248
Where's he getting
his information?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.349
Another Takterran,

03:37.351 --> 03:38.783
a guy named Oren,

03:38.785 --> 03:40.851
deeply embedded in
the abnormal faction.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.354
Sephis told me they were
out drinking one night,

03:43.356 --> 03:44.822
and Oren spilled the beans.

03:44.824 --> 03:47.324
Look, I don't know
if this is legit or not,

03:47.326 --> 03:49.760
but Sephis was pretty shaken up.

03:49.762 --> 03:52.562
I figured it was worth a trip
to warn you guys.

03:52.564 --> 03:53.964
Absolutely,
you did the right thing.

03:53.966 --> 03:54.898
Thank you.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.666
<i>Apparently this Oren fellow</i>

03:56.668 --> 03:59.702
<i>works out of a terrorist cell</i>
<i>right here in London.</i>

03:59.704 --> 04:01.438
<i>I'm thinking we should</i>
<i>stake out his favorite pub</i>

04:01.440 --> 04:02.272
<i>and pick him up.</i>

04:02.274 --> 04:03.874
Good idea, but do it covertly.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.676
We don't want to tip off
the rest of the group.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.778
<i>Understood.</i>
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

04:07.780 --> 04:09.413
All right.

04:10.616 --> 04:11.982
What do you think?

04:11.984 --> 04:13.850
How do you feel about
a trip to London?

04:13.852 --> 04:15.786
Hey, if it gets me out of
the Besovite ballet,

04:15.788 --> 04:18.522
I am all for it.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.591
Henry, call up
everything we have

04:20.593 --> 04:21.791
on the abnormal insurgency.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.160
Scour our usual channels,

04:23.162 --> 04:24.695
see if we can find
a potential target.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.729
Yeah, I'm on it.

04:25.731 --> 04:26.897
Um, Doc, what about the big guy?

04:26.899 --> 04:28.032
Ah.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.633
Leave a message for him
at his next checkpoint.

04:29.635 --> 04:30.868
There's really no point

04:30.870 --> 04:32.069
in him going
to Hollow Earth anymore.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.571
Okay.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.307
Oi.

04:38.377 --> 04:39.710
Will!

04:41.781 --> 04:43.514
Ah...

04:43.516 --> 04:44.414
How's it going?

04:44.416 --> 04:45.816
It is really great
to see you.

04:45.818 --> 04:46.917
You too.

04:46.919 --> 04:49.386
Wow, Hollow Earth
clearly agrees with you.

04:49.388 --> 04:50.787
How was the flight?

04:50.789 --> 04:52.255
Oh, man,

04:52.257 --> 04:54.091
business class is not
what it used to be.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.426
Try riding a giant
Yurka beetle for 12 hours

04:56.428 --> 04:58.662
in search of an active gateway.

04:58.664 --> 04:59.729
Do they serve meals?

05:00.866 --> 05:02.332
So, what's the latest?

05:02.334 --> 05:03.800
Um, we just got back.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.768
Found Oren at
his local watering hole.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.404
The guy likes to
get his drink on.

05:07.406 --> 05:09.005
So, where is he now?

05:09.007 --> 05:10.339
Isolation room.

05:10.341 --> 05:12.041
Is he sober
enough to talk?

05:12.043 --> 05:13.909
Does it matter?

05:16.879 --> 05:17.913
He looks dead.

05:17.915 --> 05:18.813
No, that's just

05:18.815 --> 05:21.349
the Takterran
defense mechanism.

05:23.419 --> 05:25.019
Hey.

05:28.924 --> 05:29.991
Okay, just relax.

05:29.993 --> 05:31.894
We're not
going to hurt you.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.863
We're not SCIU,
we're not Lotus,

05:34.865 --> 05:36.499
we just want
some information.

05:36.501 --> 05:38.434
I have nothing to say to you.

05:38.436 --> 05:40.570
Hmm, see, that's
not your best move.

05:40.572 --> 05:43.940
We know about the attack.

05:43.942 --> 05:45.508
Sephis...

05:45.510 --> 05:46.942
Hey, don't blame him.

05:46.944 --> 05:48.510
You're the one
who opened your big mouth.

05:48.512 --> 05:50.779
Your people are about
to make a mistake.

05:50.781 --> 05:52.113
If this attack goes through,

05:52.115 --> 05:54.416
there's gonna be
serious consequences.

05:54.418 --> 05:55.751
It'll be worth it

05:55.753 --> 05:57.553
to see your blood
soak into the earth

05:57.555 --> 06:00.388
so those underground
can taste our victory.

06:00.390 --> 06:01.656
Okay, okay.

06:01.658 --> 06:04.393
Spare me the
"death to the infidels" speech.

06:04.395 --> 06:05.794
What do you want?

06:05.796 --> 06:07.896
You have nothing to offer me.

06:07.898 --> 06:10.465
We can take you
back to Hollow Earth.

06:10.467 --> 06:11.699
You and your entire crew.

06:11.701 --> 06:13.534
And leave
the surface to you?

06:13.536 --> 06:15.035
And why would we accept that?

06:15.037 --> 06:16.537
Because it's better
than the alternative.

06:16.539 --> 06:19.072
You'll be hunted down
like beasts,

06:19.074 --> 06:20.741
and the offer
which I've just given you,

06:20.743 --> 06:22.076
you'll never get again.

06:22.078 --> 06:23.879
And you wouldn't be
making this offer

06:23.881 --> 06:25.547
if you weren't afraid.

06:25.549 --> 06:28.617
It's proof

06:28.619 --> 06:29.919
that our tactics
are working.

06:29.921 --> 06:30.820
Oh, for God's sake--

06:30.822 --> 06:31.854
Oren...

06:32.990 --> 06:34.023
Don't do this.

06:37.061 --> 06:39.129
I hope you die
like the rest of them.

06:44.502 --> 06:46.704
Okay, let's go.

06:51.777 --> 06:53.077
A-ha, there we go.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.112
Now we're talking.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.216
D-don't...
No, no, no, no, don't--

06:59.652 --> 07:01.986
Bang, zoom!

07:01.988 --> 07:03.220
Wow.

07:03.222 --> 07:04.589
Things are going well, I see.

07:06.558 --> 07:07.692
Every time I get access

07:07.694 --> 07:09.093
to one of
the priority databases,

07:09.095 --> 07:11.128
CIA, FBI, SCIU,

07:11.130 --> 07:13.198
I get kicked off
almost immediately.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.565
I thought I was
on to something

07:14.567 --> 07:15.666
with the shin bet cloud,

07:15.668 --> 07:16.901
but the same thing
happened.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.202
Look, I'm sorry, Doc.

07:18.204 --> 07:20.538
We've been voted off
the island in a big way.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.972
And you haven't been able
to find anything

07:21.974 --> 07:23.240
to confirm the attack.

07:23.242 --> 07:26.077
Other than a couple of
vague intelligence dispatches,

07:26.079 --> 07:27.178
but they have
less detail than we do.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.213
All right, well, keep looking.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.082
You're bound to find something
sooner or later.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.149
I'm about to hack
into the Japanese IAS.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.684
I might need an interpreter.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.252
You know where to find me.

07:35.254 --> 07:36.920
Hey, uh, Doc,
any word from Biggie?

07:36.922 --> 07:38.388
No, why?

07:38.390 --> 07:40.156
Well, I left a message for him
at the checkpoint in Peru.

07:40.158 --> 07:41.292
He should have got it by now.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.493
Oh, he's probably just delayed.

07:43.495 --> 07:45.262
You know
how difficult it is for him

07:45.264 --> 07:47.865
to travel without
attracting attention.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.067
Any luck
with our guest?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.168
Not so much.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.770
He's got some
pretty strong beliefs

07:51.772 --> 07:53.272
about the new world order.

07:53.274 --> 07:54.740
Yeah, I'm sure,

07:54.742 --> 07:56.575
but I may have
some good news.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.311
We downloaded
all the video feeds

07:58.313 --> 08:01.747
from the CCTV cameras
where Oren was caught,

08:01.749 --> 08:03.049
then ran them through

08:03.051 --> 08:04.850
our facial
recognition software.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.852
And...

08:06.854 --> 08:08.988
He was seen entering
or exiting this building

08:08.990 --> 08:11.824
a total of 19 times
in the past week.

08:11.826 --> 08:14.260
Hmm, score one for Big Brother.

08:14.262 --> 08:15.928
I'd hazard a guess

08:15.930 --> 08:17.863
this is where
the splinter cell meets.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:33.946 --> 08:35.547
There are bodies in here.

08:35.549 --> 08:38.249
Abnormal and human.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.184
In here.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.121
Got some here, too.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.339
Looks like

09:00.341 --> 09:02.741
somebody got here first.

09:08.143 --> 09:09.977
So, the place is trashed.

09:09.979 --> 09:10.978
<i>A SCIU hit?</i>

09:10.980 --> 09:12.246
No, I don't think so.

09:12.248 --> 09:13.881
The shootings are sloppy,
unprofessional.

09:13.883 --> 09:14.882
I'm thinking the rebels.

09:14.884 --> 09:16.317
How long ago did this happen?

09:16.319 --> 09:17.952
<i>Less than a day.</i>

09:17.954 --> 09:19.053
The bodies are still fresh.

09:19.055 --> 09:19.953
<i>I don't get it.</i>

09:19.955 --> 09:21.288
Why kill people
on your own team?

09:21.290 --> 09:22.989
Consolidation.

09:22.991 --> 09:24.757
Reduce the risk of
an information leak

09:24.759 --> 09:27.026
by eliminating
all non-essential personnel.

09:27.028 --> 09:28.627
Lovely.

09:28.629 --> 09:30.962
That's what you get
for swimming with sharks.

09:30.964 --> 09:33.031
<i>Unfortunately, this</i>
<i>only bolsters the idea</i>

09:33.033 --> 09:34.732
<i>that an attack</i>
<i>is imminent.</i>

09:34.734 --> 09:35.967
You wouldn't resort
to this step

09:35.969 --> 09:37.602
unless everything was in place.

09:37.604 --> 09:38.569
Will!

09:38.571 --> 09:39.837
Hold on, Kate's
got something.

09:39.839 --> 09:41.339
<i>What is it?</i>

09:41.341 --> 09:43.041
A shipping document,

09:43.043 --> 09:44.576
but the address
is burnt off.

09:44.578 --> 09:46.077
The only letters
I can read are...

09:46.079 --> 09:48.746
"S-b-o-a".

09:48.748 --> 09:50.348
I can run
a matching algorithm,

09:50.350 --> 09:51.983
see if I come up
with any options.

09:51.985 --> 09:54.219
Lisbon.

09:54.221 --> 09:55.987
Portugal?

09:55.989 --> 09:58.790
<i>Yeah, the Portuguese</i>
<i>spell it "L-i-s-b-o-a".</i>

09:58.792 --> 10:00.792
Now, if they were shipping
something there...

10:00.794 --> 10:02.661
We could be looking at
a second cell.

10:02.663 --> 10:04.062
Henry, go back

10:04.064 --> 10:07.166
and look for anything
related to Lisbon or Portugal.

10:07.168 --> 10:08.267
Maybe we'll get lucky.

10:08.269 --> 10:09.735
Will, Kate, we'll be in touch.

10:09.737 --> 10:11.604
All right.

10:25.051 --> 10:26.617
Hard at work, I see.

10:28.788 --> 10:31.021
It's been a long time
since I felt that.

10:31.023 --> 10:32.256
They have spectrum beds
down there,

10:32.258 --> 10:34.959
but it's just...
Not the same.

10:34.961 --> 10:38.062
You know, you can come back
topside anytime you want.

10:38.064 --> 10:39.530
I'm sure Magnus can find
a replacement for you

10:39.532 --> 10:40.365
down there.

10:43.803 --> 10:46.104
But...?

10:46.106 --> 10:48.875
It's hard to explain.

10:48.877 --> 10:52.212
What's happening down there,
will, it's incredible.

10:52.214 --> 10:54.147
Since Praxis fell,
everything is brand new.

10:54.149 --> 10:55.316
I feel like a pioneer.

10:57.285 --> 10:58.318
Everyone is so

10:58.320 --> 11:00.121
focused on the future.

11:00.123 --> 11:02.290
It's like
the past doesn't exist.

11:02.292 --> 11:03.725
It doesn't matter
where you came from,

11:03.727 --> 11:05.093
or what you've done.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.729
You can be whoever you want to.

11:07.731 --> 11:09.897
Does that make any sense?

11:09.899 --> 11:12.067
Yeah.
It sounds amazing.

11:12.069 --> 11:14.302
But, you know, you can be
whoever you want to be

11:14.304 --> 11:15.670
up here with us, too.

11:17.673 --> 11:19.507
There's more to it than that.

11:20.776 --> 11:21.676
Garris.

11:24.412 --> 11:26.713
These hard drives are toast.

11:26.715 --> 11:28.281
Come on, I got a better idea.

11:31.352 --> 11:34.120
So I hacked into
the SIS database...

11:34.122 --> 11:35.421
"SIS"?

11:35.423 --> 11:38.691
The Portuguese security
intelligence service.

11:38.693 --> 11:40.326
It's a lame acronym,
I know,

11:40.328 --> 11:41.928
especially when you got
a "P," an "I,"

11:41.930 --> 11:43.596
and two "S"s
to work with--

11:43.598 --> 11:44.430
Onward.

11:44.432 --> 11:46.031
Anyway...

11:46.033 --> 11:47.399
I figured if anything big
was going on in Lisbon,

11:47.401 --> 11:49.101
these guys would
know about it.

11:49.103 --> 11:50.969
So, after a couple
of blind alleys

11:50.971 --> 11:52.104
and a game
of cat and mouse

11:52.106 --> 11:53.339
with a system
administrator...

11:55.275 --> 11:56.976
Encrypted travel
itineraries.

11:56.978 --> 11:58.344
Now, I didn't even
know what I had

11:58.346 --> 12:00.013
until I broke the code
and saw this.

12:00.015 --> 12:01.147
"Greg Addison."

12:01.149 --> 12:01.948
Mr. Black Hat
himself.

12:01.950 --> 12:03.283
Do you recognize

12:03.285 --> 12:05.052
any of
the other names?

12:05.054 --> 12:07.922
Hagan Kiersted,
Mashita Narumi,

12:07.924 --> 12:10.225
these are all people
who deal with abnormals.

12:10.227 --> 12:12.961
It looks like they're all
getting together in Lisbon

12:12.963 --> 12:14.863
to consolidate under
the SCIU banner.

12:14.865 --> 12:17.032
And Tesla?

12:17.034 --> 12:18.133
Is not on the list,

12:18.135 --> 12:19.767
small mercies.

12:19.769 --> 12:21.169
Okay, so what do we do?

12:21.171 --> 12:23.137
Well, I'm afraid
we have no choice.

12:23.139 --> 12:24.138
We have to warn Addison.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.239
Really?

12:26.241 --> 12:27.540
Really really?

12:27.542 --> 12:29.142
I may not agree
with what these people do,

12:29.144 --> 12:30.309
but they don't deserve
to be victimized.

12:31.945 --> 12:33.078
Send me a copy of this

12:33.080 --> 12:35.180
and get in touch with
Will and Kate.

12:44.191 --> 12:45.325
You're free to go.

12:46.161 --> 12:47.060
What's the catch?

12:47.062 --> 12:48.929
No catch.

12:48.931 --> 12:49.930
You made it pretty clear

12:49.932 --> 12:51.031
you're not going to
tell us anything.

12:51.033 --> 12:52.400
Besides, we can't
risk keeping you here

12:52.402 --> 12:54.035
after what happened
to your friends.

12:56.438 --> 12:57.438
What do you mean?

13:13.422 --> 13:14.956
What...

13:21.265 --> 13:22.232
Who did this?

13:22.234 --> 13:24.968
We were hoping
that you could tell us.

13:26.437 --> 13:27.504
Look, I understand

13:27.506 --> 13:29.206
you didn't want to
betray your friends,

13:29.208 --> 13:31.542
but that doesn't seem all that
relevant anymore, does it?

13:31.544 --> 13:35.613
Whoever's planning this
has no loyalty.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.148
They will kill anybody

13:37.150 --> 13:39.216
who they think
is expendable.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.918
So you have
two choices.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.952
You can cooperate with us,

13:42.954 --> 13:45.188
or you can take your chances
out there.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.291
What do you want me to do?

13:48.293 --> 13:50.860
Tell us everything you know
about the attack.

13:50.862 --> 13:53.129
I don't know anything.

13:53.131 --> 13:55.031
I don't.
We weren't given any details.

13:55.033 --> 13:56.400
What about Lisbon?

13:58.603 --> 14:00.070
We have reason to believe
the target is there.

14:01.372 --> 14:04.475
We've been sending detonators

14:04.477 --> 14:06.277
to a group
like ours in Lisbon

14:06.279 --> 14:07.144
all week.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.979
You have an address?

14:14.453 --> 14:17.088
Well, I really don't care
who you have to disappoint.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.123
If you don't have one
gassed up and ready to go

14:19.125 --> 14:20.859
by 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning at Laughlin,

14:20.861 --> 14:22.227
I will personally--

14:23.463 --> 14:24.996
Call me back.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.243
Sorry,

14:38.245 --> 14:40.979
but I did warn them
it was urgent that I see you.

14:42.514 --> 14:46.550
Well, then,
I'm all ears.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.153
I know about the
upcoming SCIU summit

14:49.155 --> 14:50.520
in Lisbon.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.656
That's supposed to be
a secret.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.024
I'm not the only
one who knows.

14:54.026 --> 14:56.493
There's a radical group
of Hollow Earth abnormals

14:56.495 --> 14:58.061
who intend
to disrupt the summit

14:58.063 --> 14:59.062
with some kind of attack.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.129
Where did you
hear this?

15:00.131 --> 15:01.164
I'm not at liberty to say.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.332
Of course not.

15:03.334 --> 15:04.600
I'm sorry.

15:04.602 --> 15:05.834
I wish I could
give you more details,

15:05.836 --> 15:08.570
but I thought it was important
to inform you sooner

15:08.572 --> 15:10.172
rather than later.

15:10.174 --> 15:11.940
I appreciate that,

15:11.942 --> 15:13.441
but I have to say

15:13.443 --> 15:15.543
I'm a little surprised that
you're coming to me with this.

15:15.545 --> 15:17.579
I admit I was torn,

15:17.581 --> 15:19.948
but ultimately,
there are lives at stake.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.384
That's not what I mean.

15:22.386 --> 15:23.853
I'm surprised
you're coming to me

15:23.855 --> 15:24.554
because I thought
your people were behind it.

15:24.556 --> 15:25.956
Behind the attack?

15:25.958 --> 15:27.023
You can't be serious.

15:27.025 --> 15:28.058
Why not?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.559
I'm capable
of gathering evidence,

15:29.561 --> 15:30.493
just like you.

15:30.495 --> 15:32.462
Of what?

15:34.032 --> 15:35.666
You really don't know, do you?

15:54.185 --> 15:56.086
I don't understand.
What is this?

15:56.088 --> 15:58.722
Every one of the abnormals
in those photos

15:58.724 --> 15:59.990
is a hard-core
extremist,

15:59.992 --> 16:03.159
the ones responsible for
the attack in Lisbon.

16:03.161 --> 16:05.695
And according to
my latest intel...

16:05.697 --> 16:07.964
Your Sasquatch
is their new leader.

16:13.376 --> 16:14.743
You must be joking.

16:15.005 --> 16:17.939
He has been a loyal friend
for over 50 years.

16:17.941 --> 16:19.240
Well, then,
maybe you can explain

16:19.242 --> 16:20.675
why he's chumming around

16:20.677 --> 16:22.677
with the abnormal
equivalent of al Qaeda.

16:22.679 --> 16:25.279
Truthfully, I can't,
but there must be a good reason.

16:25.281 --> 16:26.881
Then bring him in.

16:26.883 --> 16:28.382
We'll question him
together.

16:28.384 --> 16:29.350
I'll do no such thing.

16:29.352 --> 16:30.551
Fine, I'll come to you.

16:30.553 --> 16:32.185
We'll talk to him
on your turf.

16:33.788 --> 16:35.021
You can't do that
either, can you?

16:35.023 --> 16:36.856
Because you have no idea
where he is.

16:36.858 --> 16:39.425
This is ridiculous.

16:39.427 --> 16:41.694
I have known him
longer than you've been alive.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.796
He is incapable
of such duplicity--

16:43.798 --> 16:44.731
open your eyes,
Doctor.

16:44.733 --> 16:46.933
Times have changed.

16:46.935 --> 16:48.802
Abnormals like your friend here

16:48.804 --> 16:50.670
are under enormous pressure
to choose sides--

16:50.672 --> 16:53.206
He did choose, a long time ago.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.775
You think
this is my only intel?

16:54.777 --> 16:57.411
Doctor, I have a room
full of recordings

16:57.413 --> 16:59.180
of your boy here,

16:59.182 --> 17:00.748
coordinating, planning,

17:00.750 --> 17:02.250
fraternizing with creatures

17:02.252 --> 17:04.318
I consider to be public enemies
number one through five.

17:04.319 --> 17:07.888
Now, frankly, I don't care
whether you believe me or not,

17:07.891 --> 17:10.724
but you need to know
how serious this is.

17:10.727 --> 17:14.128
Your tall hairy friend here
is an enemy target.

17:14.131 --> 17:17.433
Now, I am advising you
to stay well out of my way.

17:17.435 --> 17:20.737
If you don't,
I will come after you too.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.741
No way, no how.

17:25.742 --> 17:27.977
The big guy would never
do something like this.

17:27.979 --> 17:29.078
That's what I said.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.246
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>how upset he was</i>

17:30.248 --> 17:31.580
<i>when Galvo killed</i>
<i>the redstone abnormals?</i>

17:31.582 --> 17:33.081
Or when he found out about
these radical groups

17:33.083 --> 17:34.015
in the first place?

17:34.017 --> 17:34.949
<i>Of course I do.</i>

17:34.951 --> 17:36.451
It must be a mistake.

17:36.453 --> 17:39.253
I've tasked Henry with getting
to the bottom of it.

17:39.255 --> 17:40.420
<i>Well, don't worry.</i>

17:40.422 --> 17:41.455
We'll hear from
the big guy soon,

17:41.457 --> 17:42.756
and all this will be sorted.

17:42.758 --> 17:44.091
I hope you're right,

17:44.093 --> 17:46.460
but in the meantime,
you need to be on the alert,

17:46.462 --> 17:48.362
just in case you run into him,
or SCIU.

17:48.364 --> 17:50.030
I'll spread the word.

17:50.032 --> 17:52.433
We're at the Lisbon address now,
we're getting ready to go in.

17:52.435 --> 17:53.501
Be careful.

17:53.503 --> 17:55.136
Always.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.120
Someone's here.

18:41.122 --> 18:41.954
Take cover!

18:43.223 --> 18:44.924
Get down!

19:05.077 --> 19:07.512
From below, we rise!

19:18.390 --> 19:20.524
Nice shooting.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.933
Henry?

19:31.969 --> 19:34.370
What is it?

19:34.372 --> 19:37.606
I changed the security
passwords like you asked,

19:37.608 --> 19:40.842
looked for evidence
the photos had been doctored,

19:40.844 --> 19:42.144
anything that could absolve
the big guy.

19:42.146 --> 19:43.578
And?

19:43.580 --> 19:45.514
Nothing.

19:47.384 --> 19:49.217
So I searched his room.

19:51.855 --> 19:54.023
I'm sorry, Doc,
I know I shouldn't have.

19:56.059 --> 19:57.160
Did you find anything?

20:17.513 --> 20:21.349
<i>I pledge to serve</i>
<i>the cause that is just...</i>

20:26.889 --> 20:32.562
<i>I pledge to kill</i>
<i>for the cause that is just!</i>

20:32.564 --> 20:36.099
<i>I pledge to die</i>

20:36.101 --> 20:39.269
<i>for the cause that is just!</i>

20:46.912 --> 20:48.379
He's faking it, right?
It's a fake.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.649
He's working an angle,
he's gotta be.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.484
I don't think so,
not without telling me.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.252
Then why is he
acting like this?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.153
There's gotta be
a reason,

20:57.155 --> 20:58.688
something
must have happened.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.657
No.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.259
Doc?

21:10.835 --> 21:11.667
Get up!

21:11.669 --> 21:13.202
Doc, he's in

21:13.204 --> 21:14.236
a drug-induced
coma, remember?

21:15.973 --> 21:17.206
Get up,

21:17.208 --> 21:18.641
or I swear to God
I will vent the oxygen

21:18.643 --> 21:21.076
from this room.

21:21.078 --> 21:22.344
Last chance!

21:26.950 --> 21:28.984
What took you so long?

21:31.006 --> 21:31.838
You're awake!

21:32.821 --> 21:33.920
He's awake!

21:33.922 --> 21:35.821
Yes, and he has
some explaining to do.

21:39.092 --> 21:40.525
Ooh, what about
his mind powers?

21:40.527 --> 21:41.426
Aren't we--?

21:41.428 --> 21:42.460
We're protected
by the shielding

21:42.462 --> 21:43.594
on this enclosure.

21:43.596 --> 21:45.463
We're safe as long as
we don't go inside,

21:45.465 --> 21:47.832
which is, I suspect,
how you were able

21:47.834 --> 21:49.667
to overpower
my friend.

21:49.669 --> 21:51.102
Oh, such a nice fellow.

21:51.104 --> 21:53.570
So punctual with
his daily feedings.

22:02.147 --> 22:05.816
<i>It took months of effort,</i>
<i>but little by little,</i>

22:05.818 --> 22:08.886
<i>i was able to open</i>
<i>a tiny door into his mind.</i>

22:08.888 --> 22:10.121
How? You were--

22:10.123 --> 22:11.189
unconscious?

22:11.191 --> 22:13.124
Yes, but even in that state,

22:13.126 --> 22:15.960
I'm able to
project my desires.

22:15.962 --> 22:17.195
Probably wouldn't have
worked on a human,

22:17.197 --> 22:18.463
but as you know...

22:18.465 --> 22:21.199
His species has
an enlarged frontal lobe.

22:21.201 --> 22:22.901
It makes him prone to trust.

22:22.903 --> 22:25.170
Eventually, I was able
to implant the suggestion

22:25.172 --> 22:26.772
to reduce the dose
of the sedative.

22:26.774 --> 22:28.508
Once I was
fully awake--

22:28.510 --> 22:29.575
he never had a chance.

22:29.577 --> 22:30.776
What have you done to him?

22:30.778 --> 22:32.578
I re-mapped
his neural pathways

22:32.580 --> 22:33.846
to carry out my wishes.

22:33.848 --> 22:35.447
You son of a bitch!

22:35.449 --> 22:37.082
Henry.

22:37.084 --> 22:38.450
Why didn't you go with him?

22:38.452 --> 22:39.484
Why did you stay behind?

22:39.486 --> 22:41.820
I couldn't risk alerting you.

22:41.822 --> 22:44.455
Besides, I like it here.

22:44.457 --> 22:46.623
Well, that was
a very bad decision,

22:46.625 --> 22:49.993
because now
you will never be free.

22:49.995 --> 22:52.029
I wouldn't
count on that.

22:52.031 --> 22:54.498
Once my followers succeed
in sowing chaos

22:54.500 --> 22:55.866
here on the surface,

22:55.868 --> 22:58.135
you'll have no choice
but to come to me for help.

22:58.137 --> 23:00.705
Wait, Doc.

23:00.707 --> 23:02.139
He can communicate
long distances.

23:02.141 --> 23:04.909
He can command Biggie
to come back here.

23:04.911 --> 23:06.077
Sure.

23:06.079 --> 23:09.914
All you have to do
is drop the shielding,

23:09.916 --> 23:11.949
but that wouldn't
matter anyway.

23:11.951 --> 23:13.885
I can't reverse
what I've done.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.215
The re-mapping
of your friend's brain

23:16.217 --> 23:17.216
is permanent,

23:17.218 --> 23:19.218
a necessary step

23:19.220 --> 23:21.053
to ensure complete compliance.

23:26.894 --> 23:28.261
That was fast.

23:28.263 --> 23:30.029
That was
a waste of time.

23:30.031 --> 23:32.064
None of these guys know
anything about the attack.

23:32.066 --> 23:33.633
I'm starting to think
we're chasing our tails.

23:33.635 --> 23:34.634
Yeah, you and me both.

23:34.636 --> 23:35.802
Why?

23:35.804 --> 23:36.836
Well, look,
according to this data,

23:36.838 --> 23:38.738
the attack is happening
tomorrow morning

23:38.740 --> 23:40.774
at the hotel where
the summit's being held.

23:40.776 --> 23:41.942
Well, that's good, isn't it?

23:41.944 --> 23:43.010
Oh, yeah, sure.

23:43.012 --> 23:43.944
Look, it's all there,

23:43.946 --> 23:45.712
blueprints, staff schedules,

23:45.714 --> 23:46.980
even the make and model
of the rental car

23:46.982 --> 23:47.781
they're using
to infiltrate the hotel.

23:47.783 --> 23:49.850
It's too specific.

23:49.852 --> 23:51.017
Exactly.

23:51.019 --> 23:52.252
I mean, there's no way

23:52.254 --> 23:53.553
they're going to leave
this information

23:53.555 --> 23:54.354
just lying around
for anyone to see.

23:54.356 --> 23:55.355
Something's not right.

23:55.357 --> 23:57.156
You think this is all a decoy?

23:57.158 --> 23:59.292
If it is,
it's pretty elaborate,

23:59.294 --> 24:01.394
which means they're covering up
something pretty big.

24:01.396 --> 24:02.528
You're certain of this?

24:02.530 --> 24:03.996
<i>Not entirely,</i>

24:03.998 --> 24:05.430
<i>but more and more,</i>
<i>things just don't seem right.</i>

24:05.432 --> 24:08.400
<i>When I told Addison that</i>
<i>the rebels knew about Lisbon,</i>

24:08.402 --> 24:09.868
<i>he barely batted an eye.</i>

24:09.870 --> 24:11.002
Maybe he figures

24:11.004 --> 24:11.837
he's got
his bases covered.

24:11.839 --> 24:13.339
<i>Perhaps.</i>

24:13.341 --> 24:15.909
Or maybe he doesn't care about
an abnormal attack in Lisbon

24:15.911 --> 24:18.011
because the SCIU summit
is taking place elsewhere.

24:18.013 --> 24:19.947
What about those
itineraries I found?

24:19.949 --> 24:21.882
SCIU diplomats
flying into Lisbon

24:21.884 --> 24:23.050
from all over the world?

24:23.052 --> 24:24.285
Some of those flights
would have already departed,

24:24.287 --> 24:25.120
would they not?

24:25.122 --> 24:26.154
Sure, yeah.

24:26.156 --> 24:28.123
Let's pull up
the passenger manifests.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.257
Uh, okay...

24:29.259 --> 24:32.962
Flight 983 from Manila,

24:32.964 --> 24:35.998
passenger Ferdinand Pangarap...

24:36.000 --> 24:37.466
Never checked in.

24:39.170 --> 24:41.938
None of them did.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.574
So this whole Lisbon thing
is a misdirect?

24:43.576 --> 24:47.011
<i>Designed to fool the abnormals</i>
<i>into attacking the wrong site.</i>

24:47.013 --> 24:48.479
<i>Except it didn't work,</i>

24:48.481 --> 24:51.082
<i>and the abnormals</i>
<i>we caught here are just pawns.</i>

24:51.084 --> 24:53.751
Meaning that the real attack
is still going forward,

24:53.753 --> 24:56.087
only we have no idea where
or when it's taking place.

24:56.089 --> 24:59.123
<i>Addison and his people</i>
<i>are walking into a trap.</i>

24:59.125 --> 25:01.860
What do we do?
Contact him again?

25:01.862 --> 25:02.894
I have a better idea.

25:02.896 --> 25:04.463
<i>Whoa-ho...</i>
<i>Where are you going?</i>

25:04.465 --> 25:08.034
To end this uncertainty
once and for all.

25:10.070 --> 25:13.139
I want all the details
of the upcoming attack.

25:13.141 --> 25:14.973
I'm sorry, Doctor.

25:14.975 --> 25:16.842
You seem to be a fair person,

25:16.844 --> 25:19.043
treated me quite well
under the circumstances,

25:19.045 --> 25:21.212
but I've worked
too long and hard

25:21.214 --> 25:22.513
for this day

25:22.515 --> 25:25.015
to throw it away now.

25:25.017 --> 25:27.084
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

25:27.086 --> 25:29.219
Killing me
won't solve your problem.

25:29.221 --> 25:31.488
Oh, I have no intention
of killing you.

25:31.490 --> 25:34.858
You see, I've been
reading about your kind.

25:34.860 --> 25:36.894
It seems the Praxians
tried to wipe you out

25:36.896 --> 25:37.995
200 years ago.

25:37.997 --> 25:41.232
What does that
have to do with this?

25:41.234 --> 25:43.903
They found a way
to neutralize your powers

25:43.905 --> 25:46.439
by removing a specialized organ
in your brain.

25:46.441 --> 25:48.141
The iduary gland.

25:48.143 --> 25:50.043
Those operations
were barbaric.

25:50.045 --> 25:52.379
Hundreds of my ancestors
were lobotomized.

25:52.381 --> 25:54.080
Yes, they were.

25:56.085 --> 25:57.384
What are you doing?

25:57.386 --> 25:59.285
It's a sedative

25:59.287 --> 26:00.419
to knock you out
for surgery.

26:00.421 --> 26:02.221
You're bluffing.

26:02.223 --> 26:04.390
I'll admit, I've never done
this operation before,

26:04.392 --> 26:06.258
but you leave me
no choice.

26:06.260 --> 26:09.194
Naturally, I will take
every precaution.

26:11.131 --> 26:14.232
Please... stop.

26:14.234 --> 26:16.935
Details of the attack.

26:19.573 --> 26:21.506
Quickly.

26:28.481 --> 26:29.715
Magnus.

26:29.717 --> 26:31.250
<i>The summit's happening</i>

26:31.252 --> 26:34.419
<i>at the Gran Atlante Hotel</i>
<i>just outside of Buenos Aires.</i>

26:34.421 --> 26:36.287
<i>The attack is scheduled</i>

26:36.289 --> 26:37.889
<i>for noon tomorrow.</i>

26:37.891 --> 26:39.390
That's less than
12 hours from now.

26:39.392 --> 26:40.792
<i>I'm already en route.</i>

26:40.794 --> 26:41.993
Henry's been trying
to get ahold of Addison,

26:41.995 --> 26:43.228
but no luck.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.429
<i>We're on our way.</i>

26:44.431 --> 26:46.898
Will, there's one more thing.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.600
According to the Crixorum,

26:48.602 --> 26:50.135
the attack is going
to be carried out

26:50.137 --> 26:51.936
by a group of suicide bombers.

26:53.439 --> 26:55.407
Biggie's one of them.

26:55.409 --> 26:57.642
I'm afraid so.

27:15.260 --> 27:18.129
For thousands of years,

27:18.131 --> 27:21.600
the surface-dwellers
have kept us down.

27:21.602 --> 27:24.503
We suffer for their tyranny,

27:24.505 --> 27:29.643
bear the scars
of their brutality.

27:29.645 --> 27:33.413
I myself
have been their prisoner

27:33.415 --> 27:37.584
for over 50 years,

27:37.586 --> 27:42.255
but the time of the uprising
is at hand.

27:42.257 --> 27:43.523
From this day forward,

27:43.525 --> 27:47.495
the occupiers shall be
consumed by fire

27:47.497 --> 27:51.499
and drowned in blood.

27:51.501 --> 27:54.369
We will die

27:54.371 --> 27:58.639
so that others may live.

28:02.544 --> 28:05.413
From below,

28:05.415 --> 28:08.082
we rise.

28:17.835 --> 28:20.103
<i>No puede pasar, señora.</i>

28:20.105 --> 28:22.839
<i>Solamente Las personas</i>
<i>autorizadas.</i>

28:22.841 --> 28:23.873
I need to see Greg Addison.

28:25.742 --> 28:26.843
<i>Tengo que ver a Greg--</i>

28:26.845 --> 28:28.344
<i>a Greg Addison.</i>

28:28.346 --> 28:31.114
Dr. Magnus?
It's okay.

28:31.116 --> 28:32.182
What are you doing here?

28:32.184 --> 28:33.517
Why haven't you
evacuated?

28:33.519 --> 28:34.751
Didn't you get
Henry's messages?

28:34.753 --> 28:37.020
Yes, I got his messages,
all ten of 'em.

28:37.022 --> 28:39.456
You think I somehow
missed the first nine?

28:39.458 --> 28:41.658
Look, my men did a secondary
sweep of the building

28:41.660 --> 28:42.626
this morning.

28:42.628 --> 28:44.127
We have set up,
as you can see,

28:44.129 --> 28:46.196
a secure perimeter
around the entire hotel.

28:46.198 --> 28:47.731
There's nothing
to worry about.

28:47.733 --> 28:49.467
Really?
That's your position?

28:49.469 --> 28:51.335
Unless you know otherwise.

28:51.337 --> 28:53.738
These rebels that
you're so cavalier about

28:53.740 --> 28:54.805
are the same ones
that figured out

28:54.807 --> 28:55.840
you were trying to
misdirect them

28:55.842 --> 28:57.308
to Lisbon.

28:57.310 --> 28:58.844
I wouldn't underestimate
their capabilities.

28:58.846 --> 29:00.446
And what do you propose I do?

29:00.448 --> 29:02.248
Evacuate the hotel.

29:02.250 --> 29:03.816
Postpone the summit

29:03.818 --> 29:05.418
before the deadline
has passed.

29:05.420 --> 29:08.488
And let them succeed
in their goal of disrupting it?

29:08.490 --> 29:09.755
You don't know much

29:09.757 --> 29:11.056
about dealing with
terrorists, Doctor.

29:11.058 --> 29:13.393
And you don't know much
about dealing with abnormals.

29:13.395 --> 29:17.096
Look, you're worried
about your Sasquatch,

29:17.098 --> 29:18.164
I get it,

29:18.166 --> 29:19.465
but he made his choice.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.300
Now, if he and his buddies
are stupid enough

29:21.302 --> 29:23.469
to launch an attack
under these circumstances,

29:23.471 --> 29:25.471
I can't help him.

29:25.473 --> 29:26.906
You've wasted your time

29:26.908 --> 29:29.176
coming down here.

29:43.226 --> 29:46.629
Our mission
is almost complete.

29:46.631 --> 29:49.431
Soon the surface
will have no choice

29:49.433 --> 29:51.933
but to heed our demands.

29:51.935 --> 29:54.936
From below, we rise.

30:00.408 --> 30:01.875
Doc!

30:01.877 --> 30:04.044
Kate! Thank God.
Where are Will and Declan?

30:04.046 --> 30:05.412
We ran into
some trouble,

30:05.414 --> 30:06.446
and they bought me
some time.

30:06.448 --> 30:08.315
What's going on?

30:08.317 --> 30:11.318
We need to get into that hotel
and past the security.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.386
The old-fashioned way?

30:12.388 --> 30:13.454
<i>Señora, ahora.</i>

30:13.456 --> 30:14.522
Yeah.

30:38.380 --> 30:42.082
Son of a...

30:42.084 --> 30:43.317
Stop those two!

30:46.421 --> 30:47.455
Whoa, whoa!

30:47.457 --> 30:48.656
Stand down!

30:49.658 --> 30:50.992
<i>Sir?</i>

30:50.994 --> 30:51.926
What!

30:51.928 --> 30:53.361
<i>We've had</i>
<i>a security breach.</i>

30:53.363 --> 30:55.196
Yes, I know that,
I just called it in.

30:55.198 --> 30:56.931
<i>No, sir.</i>
<i>Earlier today.</i>

30:56.933 --> 30:59.200
<i>I've sent stills</i>
<i>to your tablet.</i>

30:59.202 --> 31:02.337
<i>They got in via</i>
<i>the rear access road.</i>

31:09.379 --> 31:12.081
Evacuate the hotel.

31:23.057 --> 31:25.192
They cleared out all
but a few service vehicles

31:25.194 --> 31:26.660
in advance of the summit.

31:26.662 --> 31:28.128
So where would he
be hiding?

31:28.130 --> 31:29.196
According to
the Crixorum,

31:29.198 --> 31:31.198
this hotel has
four elevator shafts.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.235
The plan was to detonate
a bomb on this level

31:34.237 --> 31:35.637
next to each one.

31:35.639 --> 31:37.606
I'll check this way.

32:09.571 --> 32:12.940
Stay back.

32:17.512 --> 32:19.379
Dear God.

32:21.716 --> 32:23.116
Yeah, make sure

32:23.118 --> 32:24.985
you keep someone
in that stairwell.

32:30.959 --> 32:32.593
Oh, great.
You too now.

32:32.595 --> 32:33.995
Where's Magnus?

32:33.997 --> 32:35.029
Inside.

32:35.031 --> 32:35.897
You let her in?

32:35.899 --> 32:36.731
Let her?

32:36.733 --> 32:38.100
No, I did not let her.

32:38.102 --> 32:39.735
She and her friend
went all Krav Maga on my men.

32:39.737 --> 32:41.036
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:41.038 --> 32:42.337
Not a chance.

32:42.339 --> 32:43.205
We're evacuating
the entire building.

32:43.207 --> 32:45.041
No one's going in there.

32:49.279 --> 32:51.247
What do we do now?

32:51.249 --> 32:53.516
Why are you here?

32:53.518 --> 32:56.018
I came to help you.
You're sick.

32:56.020 --> 32:57.320
Stay back!

32:57.322 --> 32:58.154
Please,

32:58.156 --> 32:59.722
listen to me.

32:59.724 --> 33:01.557
You're not yourself.

33:01.559 --> 33:02.625
You've been brainwashed.

33:04.060 --> 33:06.294
The Crixorum
re-mapped your brain,

33:06.296 --> 33:08.196
made you feel anger
and resentment.

33:08.198 --> 33:11.566
No, I have always
felt this way.

33:11.568 --> 33:12.600
No.

33:12.602 --> 33:14.702
You detest violence.

33:14.704 --> 33:17.471
You are one of
the most peaceful beings

33:17.473 --> 33:18.706
I have ever known.

33:20.242 --> 33:22.543
You are lying.

33:22.545 --> 33:26.246
You're only trying
to confuse me.

33:26.248 --> 33:29.349
H., it's Will.

33:29.351 --> 33:30.350
We need another way
into the hotel.

33:30.352 --> 33:31.251
Sure thing.

33:33.222 --> 33:35.355
Uh, okay, there should be
an access road

33:35.357 --> 33:36.490
on the other side
of the grounds.

33:36.492 --> 33:37.424
How far?

33:37.426 --> 33:38.692
<i>From the front entrance,</i>

33:38.694 --> 33:39.760
I'd say it's about
a good four miles.

33:39.762 --> 33:41.228
Okay, keep going.

33:42.630 --> 33:46.500
I am your oldest friend.

33:46.502 --> 33:47.801
Please.

33:47.803 --> 33:49.135
There's not much time.

33:49.137 --> 33:50.404
Just take off the vest.

34:06.556 --> 34:07.623
No...

34:09.393 --> 34:12.393
I pledge to serve
the cause that is just--

34:12.396 --> 34:13.262
Wait.

34:13.264 --> 34:14.764
You don't have to do this.

34:14.766 --> 34:16.733
I pledge to kill
for the cause that is just.

34:16.735 --> 34:18.333
Please, listen to me!

34:18.335 --> 34:19.369
I pledge to die

34:19.371 --> 34:22.138
for the cause that is just!

34:28.380 --> 34:29.646
Thank God.

34:29.648 --> 34:31.648
Quickly,

34:31.650 --> 34:34.284
let's get him
out of here.

34:34.286 --> 34:36.820
Oh, Doc,
we got a problem.

34:36.822 --> 34:39.322
Two minutes
till they all blow.

34:39.324 --> 34:41.123
All right, let's get
this vest off him.

34:41.126 --> 34:44.094
Get him into that van.

34:45.362 --> 34:47.197
Henry, where's this road, man?

34:47.199 --> 34:48.764
Should be just up ahead.

34:48.766 --> 34:50.667
<i>Any word from Magnus?</i>

34:50.668 --> 34:52.202
No, nothing.

34:52.204 --> 34:53.770
<i>They're both inside.</i>

34:56.873 --> 34:58.408
Damn.

35:05.315 --> 35:07.416
Henry, SCIU's got
this side locked off.

35:07.418 --> 35:08.250
We need another way around.

35:08.252 --> 35:09.652
This is the way around.

35:09.654 --> 35:11.387
We've gotta run it.

35:11.389 --> 35:12.322
<i>Wait, Will!</i>

35:12.324 --> 35:13.356
H-hold on a second.

35:13.358 --> 35:14.357
<i>What time you got?</i>

35:14.359 --> 35:16.460
Son of a bitch, it's noon.

35:19.298 --> 35:21.532
Don't move!
Stop right there!

35:29.308 --> 35:30.541
Magnus, come in.

35:30.543 --> 35:31.575
You gotta get
out of there now--

35:37.181 --> 35:38.515
My God.

35:42.252 --> 35:43.452
Magnus!

35:43.454 --> 35:44.887
Kate!

35:44.889 --> 35:47.223
Anybody, come in!

35:49.693 --> 35:51.761
<i>Magnus, come in.</i>

35:54.798 --> 35:57.834
<i>Kate, anyone, come in.</i>

36:01.472 --> 36:06.310
<i>Magnus, if you can read me,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

36:09.780 --> 36:12.181
<i>Magnus!</i>

36:15.180 --> 36:16.814
Magnus, please!

36:26.091 --> 36:27.191
Will...

36:27.193 --> 36:29.059
<i>This is Magnus, do you copy?</i>

36:32.263 --> 36:34.832
Don't ever scare me
like that again.

36:34.834 --> 36:36.166
Are you okay?

36:36.168 --> 36:38.202
No.

36:38.204 --> 36:39.804
We need help.

37:10.105 --> 37:11.805
Ow.

37:11.807 --> 37:12.939
Yeah, I'd say so.

37:17.711 --> 37:19.011
How long have I been out for?

37:19.013 --> 37:20.412
A week.

37:20.414 --> 37:22.180
A week?

37:22.182 --> 37:23.248
Yeah.

37:23.250 --> 37:24.649
You took a pretty bad hit.

37:24.651 --> 37:25.851
Magnus had to operate twice.

37:27.754 --> 37:28.821
What happened?

37:28.823 --> 37:30.222
The hotel--

37:30.224 --> 37:34.127
it was evacuated
before the explosion.

37:34.129 --> 37:35.395
There were
11 casualties,

37:35.397 --> 37:38.198
including three
suicide bombers.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.501
Unfortunately
hasn't done much

37:39.503 --> 37:41.770
to change world opinion
about the attacks.

37:41.772 --> 37:44.239
Most world leaders are
calling for an all-out war

37:44.241 --> 37:46.174
against the abnormals.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.010
That's exactly
what they wanted.

37:48.012 --> 37:51.747
I'm sorry...

37:51.749 --> 37:54.049
Wait, the big guy, what--

37:54.051 --> 37:54.917
He's fine.

37:54.919 --> 37:56.885
Well...

37:56.887 --> 37:58.320
He's getting better.

38:00.024 --> 38:01.156
Good.

38:01.158 --> 38:02.858
Magnus has been
trying to undo

38:02.860 --> 38:04.093
the damage
done by the Crixorum

38:04.095 --> 38:05.928
using the help of Sally.

38:05.930 --> 38:07.062
The mermaid?

38:07.064 --> 38:08.030
Yeah.

38:08.032 --> 38:10.165
I think it's working.

38:10.167 --> 38:14.169
His memories are coming back...

38:14.171 --> 38:17.105
But he feels terrible
about what happened.

38:17.107 --> 38:18.807
I'd like to see him.

38:20.109 --> 38:21.310
I think he'd appreciate that.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.048
Did the Doc say

38:25.050 --> 38:27.082
when I'll be well enough
to travel?

38:27.084 --> 38:27.983
Calm down, okay?

38:27.985 --> 38:29.719
You just woke up.

38:29.721 --> 38:31.954
I just really should be
getting back to Hollow Earth.

38:31.956 --> 38:33.289
People will be worried.

38:34.958 --> 38:38.260
Is that a...
Herusan promise band?

38:38.262 --> 38:39.261
From Garris?

38:42.766 --> 38:43.933
I looked it up.

38:45.335 --> 38:46.802
Yes.

38:48.138 --> 38:49.272
Congratulations.

38:51.208 --> 38:52.776
Thanks.

38:54.980 --> 39:00.251
<i>...We bear the scars</i>
<i>of their brutality.</i>

39:00.253 --> 39:03.322
<i>I myself</i>
<i>have been their prisoner</i>

39:03.324 --> 39:05.992
<i>for over 50 years--</i>

39:08.828 --> 39:11.330
I'm sorry.

39:13.299 --> 39:14.299
It's all right.

39:14.301 --> 39:16.201
Thank you.

39:16.203 --> 39:18.537
Wait.

39:22.444 --> 39:24.310
Please sit.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.854
What you said.

39:34.856 --> 39:35.922
About being a prisoner--

39:35.924 --> 39:37.256
I didn't mean it.

39:37.258 --> 39:38.558
Are you certain?

39:38.560 --> 39:40.193
Because if you <i> ever</i>
<i>wanted to leave--</i>

39:40.195 --> 39:41.795
You know I don't.

39:41.797 --> 39:44.131
I...

39:44.133 --> 39:47.968
Feel at home here.

39:47.970 --> 39:49.869
I always have.

39:55.141 --> 39:57.542
Things will get better,
you know.

39:59.445 --> 40:02.213
I have to live
with what I've done.

40:03.883 --> 40:06.384
I know you feel terrible,

40:06.386 --> 40:07.886
but you have to stop
beating yourself up.

40:09.155 --> 40:11.223
I mean, if anyone should
feel guilty, it's me.

40:11.225 --> 40:13.392
I'm the one who sent you
into that lion's den.

40:13.394 --> 40:15.227
No, it's not your fault.

40:15.229 --> 40:18.297
Nevertheless,
if it wasn't for me,

40:18.299 --> 40:21.567
the Crixorum would never
have had a chance to attack you.

40:21.569 --> 40:23.102
No...

40:23.104 --> 40:26.239
You did what you felt was right.

40:26.241 --> 40:28.174
Hmm.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.943
But ultimately,
I caused you pain.

40:31.312 --> 40:33.312
I knew there would be costs

40:33.314 --> 40:36.515
when I chose to take
the Sanctuary down this path,

40:36.517 --> 40:39.484
but I never intended
for you to pay the price.

40:40.953 --> 40:43.554
I blow up a hotel,

40:43.556 --> 40:45.889
almost kil--

40:48.193 --> 40:53.197
you're the one
who's apologizing?

40:58.203 --> 41:01.372
We need supplies.

41:01.374 --> 41:02.407
I'll give Henry a list.

41:02.409 --> 41:04.476
Why don't you go?

41:04.478 --> 41:05.944
Huh?

41:09.950 --> 41:11.250
Are you sure?

41:11.252 --> 41:13.620
If you feel up to it.

41:17.892 --> 41:18.993
Thank you.

42:16.052 --> 42:20.062
From below, we rise.
