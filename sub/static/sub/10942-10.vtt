Previously on "Heartland":

00:01.371 --> 00:02.703
Caleb:
What're you saying?

00:02.772 --> 00:04.439
There's no need to sign
a marriage contract

00:04.506 --> 00:06.140
<i>because you're not
legally married.</i>

00:06.208 --> 00:07.608
<i>Amy:
You and Blair -</i>

00:07.676 --> 00:09.043
<i>was there anything at all
between you guys</i>

00:09.111 --> 00:10.178
when you were travelling?

00:10.245 --> 00:11.279
No.

00:11.347 --> 00:13.047
Grant: Oh, hey, Amy.
Amy: Hi.

00:13.115 --> 00:14.648
Grant: Grant.
Amy: Good to meet you.

00:14.716 --> 00:16.050
It's been there since the moment
you picked me up in the rain.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.385
I know it, you know it.

00:17.453 --> 00:18.386
Chase kissed me.

00:18.454 --> 00:20.153
I'm gonna kill that guy.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.789
<i>Amy: No, it was me too, okay?
I kissed him back.</i>

00:22.857 --> 00:23.923
Mallory:
Hello?

00:24.859 --> 00:25.792
(Screaming) Help!

00:25.860 --> 00:27.594
Shut up and open the door!

00:27.661 --> 00:29.529
<i>Tim: One of the guys
that you let outta that truck</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:31.498
<i>shot me two years ago.</i>

00:31.565 --> 00:34.001
<i>Mallory: Please, can you just promise
not to tell my parents?</i>

00:34.068 --> 00:37.303
That's a promise
I will not make.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.740
Caleb:
So, buddy,

00:40.808 --> 00:42.675
how was the first week
of university?

00:42.743 --> 00:43.776
Oh, it was good.

00:43.844 --> 00:44.944
It was mostly
orientation though.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.480
Ha!
It was mostly beers then.

00:48.415 --> 00:51.183
(Chuckles) Yeah,
some beers were had.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.552
<i>Classes started
and I got lost a few times,</i>

00:53.620 --> 00:55.921
but, uh, I'm glad
it's the weekend.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.222
So am I.

00:57.289 --> 01:00.025
Hey, Amy, come see this dress
that I bought.

01:00.092 --> 01:01.159
Okay.

01:03.162 --> 01:04.796
(Heavy sigh)

01:04.864 --> 01:06.932
Look, I have to tell you
something.

01:07.000 --> 01:07.966
I have no one to confide in

01:08.034 --> 01:09.233
and it's just about killing me!

01:10.268 --> 01:12.503
Well, I got something
to tell you, man, and...

01:12.571 --> 01:13.938
Well, I really don't think
you're gonna believe it.

01:14.006 --> 01:15.072
You're not?

01:15.140 --> 01:17.975
I know.
Shocking but true.

01:18.043 --> 01:19.010
Oh, you're kidding me, man.

01:19.077 --> 01:20.611
No, man, I wish I was.

01:20.679 --> 01:22.312
How did that even happen?

01:22.380 --> 01:23.981
It's like a bad dream.

01:24.049 --> 01:27.316
So, you're, like,
a free man now or something?

01:27.384 --> 01:29.052
I don't know.
Like, I guess.

01:29.119 --> 01:32.455
Look, don't tell anyone,
especially Ty.

01:32.523 --> 01:34.591
I'd rather you don't
tell anyone.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.560
Please.
Especially Amy.

01:37.595 --> 01:38.528
Okay.

01:38.596 --> 01:39.663
All right.

01:40.965 --> 01:42.365
Thanks for the lift!
Bye!

01:46.002 --> 01:47.403
So...

01:47.471 --> 01:49.138
Amy and Ty:
They're not married!

01:49.206 --> 01:50.639
That's insane!

01:50.707 --> 01:51.640
You know,
this could only happen

01:51.708 --> 01:53.109
to Caleb and Ashley, right?

01:53.177 --> 01:55.178
(Laughs)
Totally. Oh, man.

01:55.245 --> 01:57.479
I am so glad that we're not
messed up like that, huh?

01:57.547 --> 01:59.647
Amy and Ty:
(Chuckling)

01:59.715 --> 02:01.783
(Tires crunch on gravel)

02:03.553 --> 02:04.619
Is that Grant?

02:06.989 --> 02:08.256
Grant, where'd you
come from, man?

02:08.324 --> 02:09.890
What are you doing here?

02:09.959 --> 02:10.991
Grant: (Car door shuts)
I was in the neighbourhood,

02:11.060 --> 02:11.993
you know,
I thought I'd stop by.

02:12.061 --> 02:12.794
It's good to see you, man.

02:12.861 --> 02:13.927
You look like hell.

02:13.995 --> 02:14.795
It's been sort of a bad week.

02:14.862 --> 02:15.929
(Violent punch)

02:17.265 --> 02:18.699
(Groans in pain)

02:18.766 --> 02:19.833
Ty:
What the hell, man?!

02:19.901 --> 02:20.968
Where's Blair?

02:21.936 --> 02:23.204
Blair?

02:23.271 --> 02:24.338
Grant:
Yeah, Blair, my ex-girlfriend?

02:24.406 --> 02:25.839
You remember her, right?
Is she here?!

02:25.907 --> 02:27.508
Ty: No, she's not!
Why would she be?!

02:27.576 --> 02:28.809
<i>I haven't seen her
since you left!</i>

02:28.876 --> 02:30.343
You're such a liar!

02:30.411 --> 02:31.344
I mean, what the hell did
you think you were doing,

02:31.412 --> 02:33.146
hooking up with my girlfriend?!

02:33.214 --> 02:35.014
What?!
Blare told me everything

02:35.082 --> 02:36.583
right before
she broke up with me,

02:36.650 --> 02:37.817
so you can cut the crap!

02:37.884 --> 02:39.085
What are you talking about,
man?!

02:39.153 --> 02:40.253
What did you think?

02:40.321 --> 02:41.287
She wasn't gonna tell me this?!

02:41.355 --> 02:42.355
Huh?!
Throw it in my face?!

02:42.423 --> 02:43.789
Look, I don't know
what she told you,

02:43.857 --> 02:46.258
but nothing happened, Grant!

02:46.326 --> 02:47.593
Really?

02:47.660 --> 02:49.394
Is that what you told
your girlfriend?

02:49.462 --> 02:51.763
Sorry, Amy, but that's bull!

02:51.831 --> 02:53.232
Three amigos, huh?
Real nice!

02:53.299 --> 02:54.166
Would you just shut up
and listen to me for a second?!

02:54.234 --> 02:55.800
(Violent punch)

02:55.868 --> 02:57.336
Grant:
I'm done listening to you, all right?!

02:57.403 --> 03:00.439
Amy:
Stop it! Stop it right now!

03:00.507 --> 03:02.140
Stop!

03:02.207 --> 03:04.742
Grant:
I will never forgive you for this!

03:10.849 --> 03:12.583

Oh, it's such a relief.

Of course.

Marnie: You know, I was fine
for the first six months,

04:06.066 --> 04:07.601
but then - wham!

04:07.668 --> 04:10.470
I just can't cope
with the smell of food cooking.

04:10.538 --> 04:12.272
Not a good thing
in my line of work.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.640
No worries.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.542
The truth is I've always
wanted to try catering,

04:15.610 --> 04:17.778
so I'm more than happy
to pitch in.

04:17.845 --> 04:19.579
Are you sure?
Mmm-hmm.

04:19.647 --> 04:20.714
I mean, aren't you only in town

04:20.781 --> 04:21.714
for what, a week or two?

04:21.781 --> 04:22.715
What about Peter?

04:22.783 --> 04:25.117
I'm in town for...

04:25.184 --> 04:26.952
I'm not sure,
but at least a month,

04:27.020 --> 04:29.054
and I'm more than happy
to help out while I'm here.

04:29.122 --> 04:30.423
Wow! I don't know
what Jerry would do

04:30.490 --> 04:33.225
if I deserted him for a month.

04:33.293 --> 04:35.394
Um, so what's the event?

04:35.462 --> 04:37.729
A wedding - this weekend.
Small.

04:37.797 --> 04:38.996
Buffet dinner.

04:39.064 --> 04:40.331
So I was thinking,
the bride wanted

04:40.399 --> 04:41.800
kind of an old-style
country club feel,

04:41.867 --> 04:44.235
so I was thinking...

04:44.303 --> 04:45.970
Oh, hey, Amy.

(Knocks lightly)

04:58.015 --> 04:59.082
Amy, come on.

05:04.322 --> 05:05.622
Amy:
I knew it.

05:05.690 --> 05:06.857
You knew what?
What're you talking about?

05:06.925 --> 05:08.892
You know what, Ty?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.626
I should've trusted my gut.

05:13.831 --> 05:16.231
Lou and Marnie:
(Talking quietly)

05:16.299 --> 05:19.301
Ty: Amy, would you just listen to me
for a second?!

05:21.672 --> 05:22.872
Where are you going?

05:22.940 --> 05:24.507
To work with Dexter.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.807
You can do that later.

05:25.875 --> 05:27.141
Ty, you remember
when I asked you

05:27.209 --> 05:28.076
if anything had ever happened

05:28.143 --> 05:29.077
with you and Blair,

05:29.144 --> 05:30.144
and you said, "no,

05:30.212 --> 05:31.713
it was just
a friendship thing"?

05:31.781 --> 05:32.814
I believed you.

05:32.882 --> 05:33.949
Because it was the truth.

05:34.016 --> 05:35.116
Amy, would you-
no!

05:35.184 --> 05:36.317
Is it that easy for you

05:36.385 --> 05:38.954
to take Grant's word
over mine?!

05:39.021 --> 05:40.088
Is it?

05:44.225 --> 05:47.227
Okay, tell me your side
of the story then.

05:51.399 --> 05:53.333
Jack:
Hey, Mallory.

05:53.401 --> 05:54.802
(Sighs)
Thanks a lot, Jack.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.637
You're welcome.
For what?

05:56.705 --> 05:58.905
For telling my parents
what happened!

05:58.973 --> 06:01.007
Well, of course I told them.

06:01.074 --> 06:03.142
Yeah, well, that was very
thoughtful of you, Jack.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.310
Now I'm only grounded

06:04.378 --> 06:06.312
for pretty much
the rest of my life.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.114
I couldn't very well
not tell them.

06:08.181 --> 06:10.349
You were in my care
when it all happened.

06:10.417 --> 06:11.684
Nothing happened!

06:11.752 --> 06:13.119
<i>Nothing happened?!</i>

06:13.186 --> 06:15.854
Because you disobeyed
a direct order,

06:15.922 --> 06:17.155
my order,

06:17.223 --> 06:18.991
you got yourself locked
into a stock trailer

06:19.058 --> 06:20.392
by a couple of criminals!

06:20.459 --> 06:22.895
But I wasn't harmed
and I said sorry.

06:22.962 --> 06:24.329
Isn't that enough?

06:24.397 --> 06:27.098
Well, sometimes you gotta
learn the hard way

06:27.166 --> 06:30.167
that your actions
have consequences.

06:30.235 --> 06:32.637
Oh, please,
spare me the platitudes.

06:34.773 --> 06:35.840
What?

06:37.976 --> 06:39.577
Tim: (Truck door slams)
You.

06:39.645 --> 06:40.811
I was just thinking about you.

06:40.879 --> 06:42.179
I'm sorry.

06:42.247 --> 06:44.381
I'm sorry I was the reason
the bad guys got away.

06:45.716 --> 06:47.584
Yeah, the bad guys
did get away.

06:47.652 --> 06:48.919
They got away
with all the calves...

06:48.986 --> 06:50.253
my calves.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.922
Now, you know how much
that adds up to?

06:51.989 --> 06:54.123
Obviously more than
my apology is worth.

06:54.191 --> 06:56.092
Thousands and thousands -
that's how much.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.495
Come on, Tim.
It's not about the money.

07:01.298 --> 07:02.898
Tim:
Sure it's about the money, Jack.

07:02.966 --> 07:04.633
It's always about the money.

07:07.971 --> 07:09.905
<i>Ty: I was thanking her for helping
you out on the course -</i>

07:09.973 --> 07:11.674
<i>you know that day
that you fell?</i>

07:11.741 --> 07:14.409
And out of nowhere
she kissed me.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.378
I told her it wasn't happening

07:16.446 --> 07:19.246
and that's it, end of story.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.784
So why didn't you
tell me about it?

07:22.851 --> 07:24.518
Because it meant nothing.

07:24.587 --> 07:25.620
The chance didn't come up...

07:25.688 --> 07:28.155
Ty, the chance came up.

07:28.223 --> 07:30.024
After I told you about Chase,

07:30.092 --> 07:31.593
I said to you,

07:31.660 --> 07:33.027
"if anything ever happened
with you and another girl,

07:33.095 --> 07:35.062
I hope you'd tell me."

07:35.129 --> 07:37.197
And what did you say?
Nothing.

07:37.264 --> 07:40.166
Because it meant nothing, Amy.

07:40.234 --> 07:41.468
It was all in her head.

07:41.535 --> 07:43.837
Really?
Yes!

07:43.905 --> 07:45.371
I backed off.

07:46.307 --> 07:47.808
I told her that
she had a boyfriend

07:47.875 --> 07:50.643
and I have a girlfriend.

07:50.711 --> 07:51.677
And I said,
"let's just keep this

07:51.745 --> 07:53.980
at a friendship thing."

07:54.047 --> 07:55.147
You can't believe Grant.

07:55.215 --> 07:56.482
I don't know what she told him,

07:56.549 --> 07:58.517
but it's not true.

07:58.585 --> 08:01.386
So what else
haven't you told me?

08:01.454 --> 08:02.788
What?

08:02.856 --> 08:04.590
Okay, forget that time.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.257
What about when
you were travelling,

08:06.325 --> 08:08.259
working together?

08:08.327 --> 08:09.260
Nothing.

08:09.328 --> 08:10.595
Ty, she kissed you.

08:10.663 --> 08:12.363
You must have given her
some encouragement.

08:12.431 --> 08:13.564
No, I didn't.

08:13.633 --> 08:15.233
You had to have!
She kissed you!

08:15.300 --> 08:17.869
Did you encourage Chase?

08:18.871 --> 08:20.772
That's not fair.

08:22.741 --> 08:24.141
(Upset sigh)

08:29.848 --> 08:33.383
Lou: What about individual
Coquilles St. Jacques?

08:33.451 --> 08:36.285
That's so retro
it's back in style.

08:41.258 --> 08:43.292
Okay, I should really go
and see...

08:43.360 --> 08:44.861
I have to go anyways.

08:44.928 --> 08:46.328
I can't even look at that
picture without wanting...

08:46.396 --> 08:47.796
Oh, sorry!

08:53.469 --> 08:55.003
Ashley:
Mom!

08:55.071 --> 08:56.371
What are you doing?!

08:56.438 --> 08:57.673
Look...

08:57.740 --> 08:59.240
I have been trying
to be open-minded,

08:59.308 --> 09:01.109
and I've been trying
to be cool,

09:01.177 --> 09:02.743
but this is the way
it's gonna be:

09:02.811 --> 09:04.378
If you two are
no longer married

09:04.445 --> 09:06.280
there's no way
you're living together.

09:06.347 --> 09:07.381
(Incredulous gasp)
Excuse me?

09:07.448 --> 09:08.649
Caleb: Yeah-
Val: Ah, ah!

09:08.717 --> 09:10.017
Who do you think you are?
My son-in-law?

09:10.085 --> 09:11.719
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

09:11.787 --> 09:14.155
I'm moving you back
to Briar Ridge.

09:14.222 --> 09:16.256
I am not a child!
You can't make me!

09:16.324 --> 09:17.391
(Mocking gasp)
"You can't make me!"

09:17.458 --> 09:19.292
And that's not being childish!

09:19.359 --> 09:21.494
Caleb and I are as married
as we ever were!

09:21.562 --> 09:22.829
Really.
Really!

09:22.897 --> 09:23.930
And what does
a tiny piece of paper

09:23.998 --> 09:25.131
even matter anyway?!

09:25.199 --> 09:26.432
I think you'll find

09:26.500 --> 09:28.001
that tiny piece of paper
matters a whole lot!

09:28.069 --> 09:29.602
Maybe to you!

09:29.670 --> 09:32.038
Ashley, why are you
so bound and determined

09:32.106 --> 09:34.007
to make yourself look bad
and embarrass yourself

09:34.075 --> 09:35.774
in front of all your friends?
Why?!

09:35.842 --> 09:36.975
You mean your friends!

09:37.043 --> 09:38.276
We're not embarrassed, you are,

09:38.344 --> 09:40.079
so get over it!

09:40.146 --> 09:42.380
I'm staying;
You're going!

09:47.020 --> 09:48.220
<i>Val:
(Trunk slams shut)</i>

09:50.289 --> 09:52.423
Thanks for backing me up!

09:52.490 --> 09:53.424
What?

09:53.491 --> 09:56.427
Why didn't you say anything?!

09:56.494 --> 09:57.962
You know what?

09:58.030 --> 09:59.864
How dare she just come here
without our permission,

09:59.932 --> 10:01.365
<i>taking my things,</i>

10:01.433 --> 10:02.499
<i>and oh, "you're moving back
to Briar Ridge."</i>

10:02.567 --> 10:04.135
(Tense exhale)

10:04.203 --> 10:06.337
It was just so humiliating,

10:06.404 --> 10:07.904
standing there,
listening to Grant

10:07.972 --> 10:11.307
accuse Ty of hooking up
with Blair.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.309
The problem is I knew
something was going on.

10:13.377 --> 10:14.577
I knew it!
I told you!

10:14.645 --> 10:16.279
Yeah, and then it
turned out to be nothing.

10:16.347 --> 10:20.016
It's not nothing, Lou.
He kissed her.

10:21.219 --> 10:22.485
(Sighs)

10:22.553 --> 10:23.753
I just don't know why
he didn't tell me.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.387
Because boys don't tell.

10:25.455 --> 10:26.889
They think, "nothing happened,

10:26.957 --> 10:28.390
so why upset the balance?"

10:28.458 --> 10:29.759
Yeah, well then
he has the nerve

10:29.826 --> 10:31.127
to go and bring up
the whole Chase thing.

10:31.194 --> 10:32.928
Well, you were probably
too upfront

10:32.996 --> 10:33.963
telling him about Chase.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.497
Remember?
I warned you not to.

10:35.565 --> 10:38.134
So being honest is a bad thing?

10:38.201 --> 10:40.301
Maybe you should be more
upfront with Peter.

10:40.369 --> 10:41.803
Maybe you wouldn't be here
all alone

10:41.871 --> 10:43.905
if you actually told him
what was bothering you.

10:43.973 --> 10:46.474
(Stunned sigh)
Uh, nice.

10:46.541 --> 10:49.911
Um, I was just trying
to be helpful.

10:49.979 --> 10:52.313
And just so you know,
I was honest with Peter.

10:52.381 --> 10:54.315
I told him exactly
what's been bothering me,

10:54.383 --> 10:55.715
and guess what?

10:55.784 --> 10:59.686
It doesn't necessarily
make everything all better.

10:59.754 --> 11:00.821
Lou...

11:08.910 --> 11:09.975
<i>Peter, hey.</i>

11:11.244 --> 11:12.378
No. No reason.

11:12.446 --> 11:15.848
I just, you know,
wanted to say hi,

11:15.916 --> 11:17.650
see how you're doing.

11:18.585 --> 11:20.152
Did I desert you?

11:20.220 --> 11:22.021
Am I a terrible wife?

11:23.490 --> 11:25.757
Oh. No, no, no, no.

11:25.825 --> 11:27.859
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

11:27.927 --> 11:29.594
No, no.
It's okay, yeah.

11:30.530 --> 11:32.297
Later's fine.

11:32.364 --> 11:33.598
Okay. Love you too.

11:34.534 --> 11:35.600
Bye.

11:37.703 --> 11:38.904
Lou?

11:38.971 --> 11:40.806
Oh, hi.

11:40.873 --> 11:42.640
I'm really sorry.

11:42.707 --> 11:44.341
It's okay.
Come here.

11:44.409 --> 11:45.275
It's okay.

11:45.343 --> 11:46.410
(Door opens)

11:47.813 --> 11:49.112
Uh, (Groans) Oh...

11:50.381 --> 11:51.649
What the heck's wrong
with everybody?

11:54.018 --> 11:56.320
Nothing.
You wouldn't understand.

11:56.387 --> 11:58.387
Uh, try me.

11:59.122 --> 12:01.491
<i>Grant's voice mail: Sorry I can't
get to the phone. Leave a message.</i>

12:01.559 --> 12:03.259
Grant, it's Ty.

12:03.327 --> 12:05.528
Look, man, we need to clear
this up, all right?

12:05.596 --> 12:07.129
You've been
seriously misled here

12:07.197 --> 12:09.532
and we need to talk...

12:09.600 --> 12:10.667
Face-to-face.

12:13.170 --> 12:14.536
We need to talk
face-to-face.

12:17.607 --> 12:21.443
We heard you had a run-in
with that girl's boyfriend.

12:21.511 --> 12:22.878
Nothing happened, Jack.

12:22.946 --> 12:24.112
Well, Amy's upset,

12:24.180 --> 12:26.682
and when Amy's upset,
I'm upset.

12:28.150 --> 12:29.217
Nothin' happened, huh?

12:31.353 --> 12:33.187
Can I ask you a question?

12:33.254 --> 12:36.223
Why can't a friend,
even if it's a girl,

12:36.291 --> 12:38.893
spend some time just visiting,

12:38.961 --> 12:40.595
hanging out?

12:40.662 --> 12:44.499
Jack: Because, according to Amy,
she didn't just hang out.

12:44.566 --> 12:45.765
That was all her!

12:45.833 --> 12:47.968
I didn't do anything, okay?!

12:48.035 --> 12:50.670
You are stupider than you look.

12:50.738 --> 12:51.905
What?

12:51.973 --> 12:53.373
What was Blair doing over here

12:53.440 --> 12:55.809
while her boyfriend
was somewhere else?

12:55.877 --> 12:58.144
Did you think about that?

12:59.079 --> 13:00.814
Jack, nothin'.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.516
Did you maybe see that
as a signal?

13:03.583 --> 13:04.750
Are you that naive?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.953
Okay, I'm an idiot!
I didn't see it coming

13:08.021 --> 13:08.921
and now it's back to bite me.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.256
I should've told Amy.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.925
Do you tell Janice everything?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.894
Yeah.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.729
She scares the crap out of me.

13:18.664 --> 13:22.000
Jack, do you tell every
single thing about your life

13:22.067 --> 13:23.267
to Lisa?

13:23.335 --> 13:24.435
No, but I didn't bring
a woman home

13:24.503 --> 13:26.838
on the back of my bike either.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.744
<i>Announcer on computer:
Some of the greatest ropers in the world!</i>

13:33.811 --> 13:36.312
<i>Ten of them will rope,
four will advance.</i>

13:37.248 --> 13:38.615
<i>Give it up for the ropers...</i>

13:38.683 --> 13:39.917
Caleb:
Hey!

13:41.085 --> 13:43.253
Ashley:
I can't talk above that noise.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.588
(Sighs heavily)

13:44.656 --> 13:45.923
Talk about what?

13:45.990 --> 13:47.223
The future.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.926
What're we gonna do?

13:49.860 --> 13:50.526
About...?

13:50.594 --> 13:52.261
About us, Caleb.

13:52.328 --> 13:53.863
What're we gonna do about us?

13:53.931 --> 13:56.032
What is everybody gonna think?

13:56.967 --> 14:00.302
You let your mother get to you,
didn't ya?

14:00.370 --> 14:03.906
Ashley, who cares
what people think?

14:03.974 --> 14:05.874
Our friends are all right
with it, aren't they?

14:05.942 --> 14:07.008
Our friends?

14:08.210 --> 14:09.611
Who did you tell?

14:10.546 --> 14:11.212
No one.

14:14.550 --> 14:15.383
Ty.

14:15.451 --> 14:16.818
Amy.

14:16.886 --> 14:18.553
You see?
There it is!

14:18.621 --> 14:19.788
There is what?

14:19.855 --> 14:21.722
We were afraid
to tell each other

14:21.790 --> 14:22.890
that we told them.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.992
Why?!
Do we feel guilty?

14:25.060 --> 14:26.660
I don't feel guilty.

14:26.728 --> 14:28.762
And what do you mean
you don't feel guilty?

14:28.830 --> 14:30.598
Does that mean you don't
wanna make it right?!

14:30.665 --> 14:32.967
I just do not understand
what is so wrong

14:33.034 --> 14:35.069
that it needs to be made right.

14:35.136 --> 14:36.604
I don't get it.

14:36.671 --> 14:38.504
Well, you know what?
If you don't get it now,

14:38.572 --> 14:40.840
you never will.
Just watch your damn rodeo!

14:43.410 --> 14:46.445
Ashley: Where are you going?
Caleb: Out.

14:46.513 --> 14:47.246
(Door bangs shut)

14:47.314 --> 14:48.681
(Frustrated sigh)

14:49.617 --> 14:52.251
Caleb:
Geez, I thought I had problems.

14:52.319 --> 14:53.552
Yeah, well, you do.

14:54.487 --> 14:56.088
So did ya?

14:56.155 --> 14:57.623
Did I what?

14:57.690 --> 14:59.357
Did you hook up with Blair?

14:59.425 --> 15:00.758
No, I didn't!

15:01.593 --> 15:03.928
But I may as well have
the way Amy's taking it.

15:03.996 --> 15:05.195
(Sighs heavily)

15:05.263 --> 15:06.964
It's relationships, man.
They're...

15:07.032 --> 15:08.833
It's a lot like a bronc ride;

15:08.900 --> 15:10.668
a whole lot can happen
in eight seconds.

15:10.736 --> 15:11.802
(Chuckles)

15:11.870 --> 15:13.070
<i>Caleb:
Well, it's true.</i>

15:13.138 --> 15:15.305
I've been thinking about
what you said,

15:15.373 --> 15:16.973
about being a free man.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.108
Yeah, and?

15:19.409 --> 15:20.610
Maybe it's a sign.

15:20.678 --> 15:22.178
A sign?

15:22.246 --> 15:23.613
Maybe I should be thinking

15:23.681 --> 15:26.415
whether or not it was worth it
to be married.

15:26.483 --> 15:29.085
Come on, man.
You were happy being married.

15:29.153 --> 15:30.486
I've never seen you
so damn happy.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.821
It was ridiculous.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.421
<i>Caleb:
Yeah, but...</i>

15:33.489 --> 15:36.158
Maybe I was just happy
with the idea of being married.

15:36.225 --> 15:37.392
<i>(Sighs)</i>

15:37.460 --> 15:39.028
I know I shouldn't obsess,
but...

15:39.095 --> 15:41.296
That's just the kind
of guy I am.

15:41.364 --> 15:42.564
I think too much.

15:42.632 --> 15:46.001
You thinking way too much
is an oxymoron.

15:46.069 --> 15:47.502
Did you just call me a moron?

15:47.570 --> 15:50.271
No, he is.
Amy told me everything.

15:50.338 --> 15:52.707
You deserve that face.

15:52.775 --> 15:53.841
(Sighs)

16:01.116 --> 16:02.183
(Sighs)

16:03.919 --> 16:05.152
(Sighs heavily)

16:07.555 --> 16:08.822
(Taps nervously)

16:10.457 --> 16:11.858
Peter, hi.

16:13.194 --> 16:14.327
You must be out.

16:14.395 --> 16:18.131
Um, can you give me
a call back?

16:19.300 --> 16:22.168
(Tearful)
Can you give me a call back, please?

16:22.235 --> 16:24.036
(Whispers)
Okay, bye.

16:28.474 --> 16:30.275
(Sighs heavily)

16:31.444 --> 16:35.848
I don't know why I took this
catering job from Marnie.

16:35.916 --> 16:38.850
I've got butterflies
and my stomach is...

16:38.918 --> 16:40.484
Totally off.

16:41.721 --> 16:43.788
What's wrong, Lou?

16:47.927 --> 16:50.161
(Tearful)
I don't know, grampa.

16:50.229 --> 16:51.529
I don't know.

16:52.931 --> 16:55.733
Well, something's going on.

16:57.401 --> 16:58.702
The last week or so,

16:58.770 --> 17:01.905
you've been pretty up and down.

17:03.708 --> 17:06.710
Do you remember
before the wedding,

17:06.778 --> 17:11.347
I told you that I was afraid
to lose what I had here?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.883
And you said that
if I loved Peter

17:13.951 --> 17:16.518
I would only be gaining.

17:18.555 --> 17:20.990
Well, um,

17:21.058 --> 17:25.292
I don't feel like
I've gained anything, grandpa.

17:25.361 --> 17:27.762
I feel like I've lost.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.599
I'm lost.

17:40.442 --> 17:41.508
(Sniffs)

17:47.949 --> 17:50.717
Caleb: (Sighs tiredly,
boot thumps on floor)

17:50.786 --> 17:52.887
You ready to turn in, babe?

17:52.954 --> 17:54.021
Yup.

17:55.390 --> 17:56.456
Caleb...

17:57.557 --> 17:59.092
I was thinking...

18:00.027 --> 18:02.595
That you should probably uh...

18:03.530 --> 18:04.563
You know.

18:04.631 --> 18:05.965
Should what?

18:06.901 --> 18:09.468
Sleep on the couch?

18:09.536 --> 18:10.804
The couch?

18:10.871 --> 18:11.938
Yeah.

18:12.806 --> 18:15.607
I know it sounds silly,
but uh...

18:16.609 --> 18:18.510
(Sighs heavily)

18:26.953 --> 18:29.821
(Crickets chirp)

18:41.733 --> 18:43.067
(Sighs heavily)

18:46.871 --> 18:48.638
<i>Blair:
I think I'm in love with you.</i>

18:48.706 --> 18:49.873
Blair: Hey.
Ty: Hey.

18:54.312 --> 18:56.146
I like you a lot.

18:57.081 --> 18:59.082
You led me on.

18:59.150 --> 19:02.184
<i>Ty: You have a boyfriend, Blair,

19:06.656 --> 19:07.723
Hey.

19:09.659 --> 19:10.726
Hey.

19:14.164 --> 19:17.631
How's your eye?
You still look pretty rough.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.033
I'm fine.

19:21.303 --> 19:25.439
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about things and...

19:27.209 --> 19:29.043
(Sighs)
I figured,

19:29.111 --> 19:32.946
yeah, you kissed Blair,
but I kissed Chase

19:33.014 --> 19:36.416
and I guess that
sort of makes us even.

19:37.352 --> 19:38.986
(Nervous laugh)
I just...

19:39.053 --> 19:42.022
I just think we should put
all this behind us.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.991
There is nothing
to put behind us;

19:44.058 --> 19:46.659
nothing happened with Blair.

19:48.462 --> 19:50.263
Okay.
(Chuckles)

19:50.330 --> 19:52.831
I'll shut up now.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.702
We've been down
that road before.

19:56.770 --> 19:58.704
Let's try a new one.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.441
Amy?

20:04.311 --> 20:07.379
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

20:08.314 --> 20:10.415
It was stupid of me not to.

20:11.683 --> 20:13.051
From now on,

20:13.119 --> 20:14.752
let's be completely honest
with each other.

20:17.156 --> 20:19.124
No matter what happens.

20:19.191 --> 20:20.725
No matter what.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.760
Okay.

20:23.828 --> 20:24.895
Okay.

20:27.966 --> 20:29.366
I love you.

20:29.434 --> 20:31.235
I love you too.

20:39.043 --> 20:40.743
(Railing clunks)

20:40.811 --> 20:42.111
How's that?

20:43.013 --> 20:45.714
Amy: Looks perfect.
Okay, watch him.

20:46.650 --> 20:47.683
Ty:
Ah, he looks good!

20:47.751 --> 20:48.684
Amy:
I know, right?

20:48.752 --> 20:49.785
Ty:
(Laughs)

20:49.853 --> 20:50.954
Amy:
Yeah, well, I mean,

20:51.021 --> 20:52.455
a lot of race horses
actually go on

20:52.522 --> 20:54.823
to be hunter-jumpers
or eventers.

20:54.890 --> 20:56.191
I think he loves jumping!

20:56.259 --> 20:57.759
Yeah, maybe more than racing.

20:57.827 --> 20:59.794
Oh, my dad'll love that, huh?

20:59.862 --> 21:01.496
(Laughs)

21:01.564 --> 21:03.832
Yeah, he'd be all over that.

21:03.899 --> 21:05.300
(Chuckles)

21:05.368 --> 21:06.935
(Car rumbles up)

21:09.338 --> 21:10.504
(Car door shuts)

21:10.572 --> 21:11.638
Hey, guys.

21:19.804 --> 21:21.370
<i>What're you doing here,
Blair?</i>

21:21.438 --> 21:23.406
Have you seen Grant?

21:23.473 --> 21:25.741
He came by here yesterday
looking for you.

21:25.809 --> 21:27.876
Looking for me?
Why?

21:27.944 --> 21:30.479
<i>Amy: How can you just show up here
and act like nothing's wrong?</i>

21:30.547 --> 21:33.082
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you've caused?

21:34.851 --> 21:35.784
No? Okay, let me tell you-!

21:35.852 --> 21:36.884
Ty:
Amy, Amy.

21:36.952 --> 21:40.322
(Quietly)
I'll handle this, okay?

21:40.389 --> 21:43.124
I need to talk to you,
privately.

21:43.192 --> 21:44.192
Anything you have to say to me

21:44.260 --> 21:45.727
you can say in front of Amy.

21:45.794 --> 21:48.029
Amy: (Quietly)
Ty, just go.

21:48.097 --> 21:49.163
It's okay.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.634
Blair:
So, what did Grant say?

21:53.702 --> 21:56.203
I haven't seen him in days.
I was so worried.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.971
What did you tell him?

21:58.039 --> 21:59.506
What do you mean?

21:59.574 --> 22:00.907
No, don't play that.
Ty...

22:00.975 --> 22:03.810
Tell me what you said to him!

22:04.746 --> 22:07.114
Okay, um, it's a total mess.

22:07.181 --> 22:08.314
Grant and I got in
this huge fight

22:08.382 --> 22:09.515
and he took off.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.517
Yeah, I know all about
your fight.

22:11.585 --> 22:14.220
Apparently you told a bunch
of crap to Grant about us.

22:14.288 --> 22:16.756
He wasn't too happy.

22:16.823 --> 22:19.459
What?
Grant fought you over me?

22:19.526 --> 22:21.193
What did you tell him?

22:21.262 --> 22:23.863
I told him that we're friends.

22:23.930 --> 22:27.832
Oh, and that's why
he wanted to kill me.

22:29.269 --> 22:30.769
Fine, um...

22:31.337 --> 22:36.275
I told him that we kissed;
That we liked each other.

22:36.342 --> 22:39.711
Well, that's not even close
to what he said.

22:39.779 --> 22:42.780
He thinks we hooked up, Blair.

22:42.847 --> 22:44.114
Okay...

22:45.049 --> 22:46.550
I lied.

22:46.618 --> 22:49.720
I told him we got together
while we were travelling.

22:49.788 --> 22:51.155
Why would you say that?!

22:51.222 --> 22:54.091
Because I was mad
and I wanted to hurt him.

22:54.159 --> 22:56.160
It just came out!

22:57.328 --> 23:00.397
I'm so sorry.
I never meant...

23:02.199 --> 23:03.600
You need to tell Amy.

23:03.668 --> 23:05.935
You need to tell her the truth.

23:06.003 --> 23:07.671
Right now.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.441
Caleb: Honey, have you seen my keys?
I'm gonna be late.

23:12.742 --> 23:13.676
(Clears throat)

23:13.743 --> 23:14.943
(Grunts)

23:15.011 --> 23:16.512
Do you have to drink
out of the milk carton?

23:16.579 --> 23:18.013
It's gross!

23:18.748 --> 23:21.183
And why do you leave
your coffee cups in the sink

23:21.250 --> 23:22.618
without washing them?!

23:22.686 --> 23:23.686
They're getting
all brown inside!

23:23.753 --> 23:24.787
Is this gonna be one of those

23:24.854 --> 23:27.856
pick-on-the-other-guy
mornings?

23:27.924 --> 23:29.824
Okay, fair enough.

23:29.891 --> 23:32.360
Why do I have to wade
through a million bras

23:32.428 --> 23:33.861
when all I want to do
is take a shower?

23:33.929 --> 23:35.530
And why do you leave
your shoes on the floor?

23:35.597 --> 23:36.698
I damn near broke my ankle

23:36.765 --> 23:37.898
getting up out of bed
the other day.

23:37.966 --> 23:38.899
Oh, wait,

23:38.967 --> 23:40.668
that's not my bed anymore.

23:40.736 --> 23:42.704
Well, I guess you don't
have to put up with it

23:42.771 --> 23:44.238
if you don't want to.

23:44.306 --> 23:45.672
I mean, we have choices, right?
I guess we do.

23:45.740 --> 23:46.673
I mean, it's not like
we're married.

23:46.741 --> 23:49.042
Heck, we're not even engaged!

23:49.109 --> 23:50.076
Come on now.

23:50.144 --> 23:51.611
No, really.

23:51.679 --> 23:52.813
You know, one good thing

23:52.880 --> 23:53.747
may have come out
of all of this:

23:53.815 --> 23:54.948
We can sell this

23:55.015 --> 23:57.250
and pay off
your damn credit card bill!

23:57.318 --> 23:59.986
Don't do this, ash.

24:01.521 --> 24:02.588
All right.

24:05.425 --> 24:06.492
(Door slams shut)

24:12.165 --> 24:14.400
(Cell keypad beeps)

24:17.403 --> 24:19.237
(Tearful)
Hey, mom.

24:19.304 --> 24:20.372
It's me.

24:21.507 --> 24:23.475
I need to talk to you.

24:25.845 --> 24:27.044
<i>Blair:
Amy!</i>

24:27.112 --> 24:28.279
Listen, Ty is telling you
the truth.

24:28.347 --> 24:29.781
It was me who came onto him.

24:29.849 --> 24:32.350
I picked up
the wrong signals, I guess.

24:32.417 --> 24:33.350
And I shouldn't have
lied to Grant,

24:33.418 --> 24:35.018
but I had my reasons.

24:35.086 --> 24:36.119
We were gonna move in together

24:36.187 --> 24:37.354
and then one night he just...

24:37.422 --> 24:39.222
He never showed up
and he never called.

24:39.290 --> 24:41.024
And then there were pictures
all over Facebook

24:41.092 --> 24:42.493
of him
and his ex-girlfriend.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.728
He denied everything,
but I didn't believe him

24:44.796 --> 24:46.029
and I wanted to hurt him,

24:46.097 --> 24:48.564
so I made up a story
about me and Ty.

24:48.632 --> 24:50.700
That's real nice.

24:52.068 --> 24:55.237
I didn't know Grant would
react the way he did.

24:55.305 --> 24:56.672
I'm so sorry that I hurt you...

24:56.740 --> 24:58.340
both of you.

25:00.277 --> 25:01.544
So, are we good?

25:03.313 --> 25:04.479
Please, Amy...

25:07.450 --> 25:10.685
Thanks for clearing it up.

25:14.223 --> 25:16.157
<i>Mallory:
I'm not buying it.</i>

25:16.225 --> 25:17.826
Why would Blair even come here
in the first place?

25:17.894 --> 25:19.828
It's not like she knew about
Grant's little visit.

25:19.896 --> 25:21.361
She might have.

25:21.430 --> 25:23.631
No way! She just came here
to see Ty.

25:23.698 --> 25:25.633
Face it, she is a liar.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.302
She lied to her boyfriend
who she supposedly loves.

25:28.369 --> 25:30.404
Why would you believe
anything she says?

25:30.472 --> 25:31.772
You know what, Mallory?

25:31.840 --> 25:32.873
I really don't wanna
hear this right now.

25:32.941 --> 25:34.975
Okay?
It's not helping anything.

25:35.043 --> 25:36.376
Fine, but if you would've
just listened to me

25:36.444 --> 25:37.477
in the first place,

25:37.545 --> 25:39.579
you'd never be
in this situation.

25:39.647 --> 25:41.881
Actions have consequences, Amy!

25:43.283 --> 25:44.216
<i>(Door slams shut)</i>

25:44.284 --> 25:45.718
I sound like Jack.

25:45.786 --> 25:46.920
Shoot me now.

25:48.856 --> 25:50.723
You gave him his ring back?

25:50.791 --> 25:52.825
Ashley: (Frustrated sigh)
He made me so mad.

25:52.892 --> 25:54.626
I mean, we've been bickering
all the time now

25:54.694 --> 25:57.496
and he's been bugging me
in ways he never has.

25:57.564 --> 25:58.797
Yeah, well,

25:58.865 --> 26:00.732
you're probably both
just looking for things.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.300
I guess so.

26:03.235 --> 26:04.803
(Sighs)
Honey...

26:04.871 --> 26:06.738
I hate to be blunt, but...

26:06.806 --> 26:08.739
Caleb married you in a rush.

26:08.807 --> 26:11.275
Now that he finds himself free,

26:11.343 --> 26:14.178
he's probably just having
second thoughts.

26:14.245 --> 26:16.514
He's not the only one.

26:16.582 --> 26:17.882
And maybe that's
not all bad, huh?

26:17.950 --> 26:18.950
It is.

26:19.017 --> 26:20.918
No, it's not.

26:20.986 --> 26:23.454
Look at the positive.
It's an opportunity,

26:23.522 --> 26:24.621
a chance to start fresh.

26:24.689 --> 26:26.623
I don't wanna start fresh!

26:26.691 --> 26:30.159
No, of course you don't,
not right now,

26:30.227 --> 26:33.429
but, Ashley, maybe it is time
to call it a day,

26:33.498 --> 26:37.567
pretend none of this
nonsense ever...

26:37.635 --> 26:38.602
(Sighs heavily)
Sorry.

26:38.669 --> 26:40.936
This situation ever happened.

26:41.004 --> 26:43.071
Put it behind you.

26:45.609 --> 26:47.275
Tim:
Come on, cow!

26:48.211 --> 26:49.578
Caleb:
Hi-yah! Get moving,

26:49.646 --> 26:51.480
you filthy, no-headed,
excuse for an animal!

26:57.252 --> 26:58.419
What's eatin' you?

26:58.487 --> 26:59.521
Caleb:
Nothin'.

26:59.588 --> 27:00.955
Oh really?

27:01.023 --> 27:02.557
'Cause you're usually
Mr. Frickin' sunshine.

27:02.625 --> 27:03.958
<i>Caleb:
Yeah? Well, I've got a problem.</i>

27:04.026 --> 27:06.594
That's all.
Oh!

27:06.662 --> 27:08.129
Well, guess what?

27:08.196 --> 27:10.197
The whole world has problems,
Caleb.

27:10.265 --> 27:11.566
I got problems.

27:11.634 --> 27:13.466
Yeah, well, not like this.
There's no way.

27:13.535 --> 27:15.936
Really?
So what's your problem?

27:16.004 --> 27:19.305
It turns out Ashley
and I aren't married.

27:19.373 --> 27:20.908
Yeah, the idiot in Montana,

27:20.975 --> 27:22.108
he wasn't licenced.

27:22.176 --> 27:23.844
So the whole thing's
screwed up.

27:23.912 --> 27:24.878
It's not legal.

27:24.946 --> 27:26.013
(Laughs)

27:30.083 --> 27:31.150
(Laughs hard)

27:31.718 --> 27:33.052
Man, that's not funny!

27:33.119 --> 27:35.454
Tim: Oh, you're right.
No, it's perfect!

27:35.522 --> 27:38.123
Oh, Val must be spittin' nails.

27:38.191 --> 27:39.659
(Giggles)

27:39.726 --> 27:41.027
<i>Aw, Caleb!</i>

27:41.094 --> 27:42.528
(Laughs)

27:42.596 --> 27:44.329
Who married you?
An Elvis impersonator?

27:44.397 --> 27:47.198
(Surprised grunt)
Ungh! Goddammit!

27:47.266 --> 27:50.201
Caleb: I told you it's not funny!
It's not funny!

27:50.269 --> 27:53.104
Tim: (Laughs hysterically)
Caleb, get off of me!

27:53.172 --> 27:54.138
Whoa!

27:54.206 --> 27:56.274
What is wrong with you?!

27:58.811 --> 28:00.978
Caleb:
The worst thing is...

28:01.046 --> 28:02.646
I think she's starting
to regret it.

28:02.714 --> 28:04.481
Oh, how do you know that?

28:05.416 --> 28:07.417
She gave me
the engagement ring back.

28:07.485 --> 28:10.554
Ah, okay, well...

28:10.622 --> 28:14.324
Since we got married
in such a rush and...

28:14.392 --> 28:16.193
I think maybe now
she's had time to realize

28:16.260 --> 28:18.194
I'm not good enough for her.

28:18.261 --> 28:20.697
She can do so much better
than me!

28:20.764 --> 28:22.164
I'm a rodeo cowboy.

28:23.100 --> 28:25.367
How low on the rung
can you get?

28:25.435 --> 28:27.136
No disrespect.

28:27.204 --> 28:28.270
None taken.

28:31.241 --> 28:32.308
Caleb,

28:34.276 --> 28:36.878
you're good enough for her.

28:36.946 --> 28:39.581
You're plenty good
for that girl.

28:40.516 --> 28:41.984
<i>You know,
you've had some problems,</i>

28:42.051 --> 28:44.853
you've pulled yourself back up.

28:44.921 --> 28:45.988
Uh...

28:46.055 --> 28:48.656
I'd almost say
I'm proud of you.

28:48.724 --> 28:50.257
<i>But you're a good man,</i>

28:50.325 --> 28:53.393
<i>and a good man needs
a strong woman behind him.</i>

28:54.329 --> 28:55.997
Hey.

28:56.064 --> 28:57.531
Don't go walkin' away
from something

28:57.599 --> 29:01.035
that your gut is telling you
is good for you.

29:02.938 --> 29:05.672
I just want
what's good for her.

29:11.245 --> 29:13.680
Jack: Boy, something sure
smells good.

29:13.748 --> 29:15.015
Lou:
Yeah.

29:15.082 --> 29:16.016
How are you feeling?

29:16.083 --> 29:17.416
I am great.

29:17.484 --> 29:20.386
You know, this is gonna be
one happy bride, grampa.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.187
The menu is fabulous.

29:22.255 --> 29:23.956
Jack: (As the phone rings)
Good.

29:24.891 --> 29:26.491
(Phone rings)

29:26.559 --> 29:27.626
Peter, hi!

29:29.495 --> 29:30.996
What?

29:31.064 --> 29:32.430
N-no!

29:32.498 --> 29:35.567
Don't even think
about coming here.

29:35.635 --> 29:37.501
I'm...I'm fine.

29:38.436 --> 29:40.237
Yes, I'm fine.

29:40.305 --> 29:41.505
Okay.

29:41.573 --> 29:43.607
Yeah, you do what you gotta do.

29:43.676 --> 29:44.976
I love you too.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.110
Okay, bye.

29:47.746 --> 29:49.280
Okay, now,

29:49.347 --> 29:51.615
yesterday you were crying
and were unhappy with the world

29:51.684 --> 29:53.150
and everything in it and...

29:53.217 --> 29:56.486
Grampa, no, I'm...
I'm fine,

29:56.554 --> 29:58.021
and Peter is great,

29:58.089 --> 30:01.158
and Marnie really needs
my help.

30:01.225 --> 30:03.660
Mmm! And I am happy
to be there for her.

30:03.728 --> 30:05.461
So...

30:09.432 --> 30:11.133
(Tense exhale)
Um...

30:11.201 --> 30:12.868
Grandpa, could you...

30:12.936 --> 30:13.936
Would you take this outside?

30:14.004 --> 30:16.638
It really needs to cool off.

30:16.707 --> 30:18.373
Yeah.
Please?

30:18.441 --> 30:19.374
Yeah, okay.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.843
Thank you so much.
Okay.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.080
(Woozy exhale)

30:25.147 --> 30:26.214
(Water runs)

30:26.816 --> 30:27.882
(Gulps air)

30:29.952 --> 30:31.352
(Breathing hard)

30:32.387 --> 30:34.189
(Blows out her breath)

30:38.460 --> 30:40.195
<i>(Door opens)</i>

30:40.262 --> 30:41.461
(Door slams shut)

30:43.397 --> 30:45.999
(Thunder rumbles
in the distance)

30:49.303 --> 30:50.370
Hey.

30:51.439 --> 30:52.740
Look...

30:52.807 --> 30:55.175
I'm really sorry about
what happened this morning.

30:55.243 --> 30:56.309
I am too.

30:57.444 --> 30:59.145
I've been thinkin'.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.380
I need you to know
that I love you

31:01.448 --> 31:03.649
and I'd fight for you, but...

31:03.717 --> 31:04.850
I'm getting the feeling

31:04.917 --> 31:06.618
like maybe
you don't want me to.

31:06.685 --> 31:08.153
Caleb, I...

31:08.221 --> 31:09.587
Okay, you were right.

31:09.655 --> 31:12.824
We've got choices now and...

31:12.892 --> 31:13.992
I can't make you stay with me

31:14.060 --> 31:16.128
if you don't want me to.

31:17.063 --> 31:19.798
You're no caged bird, ash.

31:22.033 --> 31:24.334
So I've been thinking
the best way to keep you

31:24.402 --> 31:26.904
is for me to set you free.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.973
What are you saying?

31:29.908 --> 31:33.710
I'm saying I think
I have to leave you.

31:34.946 --> 31:36.213
Leave me?

31:37.148 --> 31:39.816
Figure out what you want.

31:54.230 --> 31:56.064
(Sniffs)

31:56.132 --> 31:57.699
(Ragged sigh)

32:03.673 --> 32:05.307
Blair:
Hey.

32:05.374 --> 32:07.142
Ty:
Hey.

32:07.210 --> 32:08.910
Blair:
I just came to say bye.

32:08.977 --> 32:10.144
I'm gonna head out.

32:11.079 --> 32:12.446
Ty:
To Vancouver?

32:13.381 --> 32:14.715
That's a pretty long drive.

32:14.783 --> 32:16.818
It's a little late for that,
isn't it?

32:16.885 --> 32:18.019
Well...

32:18.086 --> 32:20.554
I can't stay here, can I?

32:20.622 --> 32:21.689
No.

32:24.392 --> 32:25.725
Were you...

32:27.128 --> 32:29.029
Attracted to me...

32:30.497 --> 32:32.365
Just a little bit?

32:33.667 --> 32:35.969
We had some good times, Blair.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.338
We had a lot of fun,

32:38.405 --> 32:41.273
and you're a good lookin' girl.

32:41.341 --> 32:42.607
I'd be lying

32:42.675 --> 32:46.312
to say any guy wouldn't be
attracted to you,

32:46.379 --> 32:49.181
but it wasn't gonna happen.

32:54.387 --> 32:56.955
Any other time or place?

33:00.159 --> 33:01.525
(Sighs heavily)

33:01.593 --> 33:02.927
Just let it go.

33:07.266 --> 33:09.400
<i>(Vehicle rumbles nearby)</i>

33:20.411 --> 33:21.879
(Door bangs shut)

33:22.680 --> 33:23.747
Great.

33:24.782 --> 33:26.583
Can I join the party?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.968
<i>What is this?
What are you doing?!</i>

33:34.137 --> 33:35.237
<i>Blair:
Grant, please.</i>

33:35.305 --> 33:36.271
Come on, man,
listen to me this time.

33:36.339 --> 33:37.940
Why?
So you can lie to me again

33:38.008 --> 33:38.975
and tell me
there's nothing going on

33:39.042 --> 33:40.576
between the two of you?!

33:40.644 --> 33:42.411
I mean, what did you do, Blair?

33:42.479 --> 33:44.178
You run to Ty the second
I was out the door?!

33:44.246 --> 33:45.413
I went looking for you!

33:45.481 --> 33:46.781
That's bull!

33:46.849 --> 33:47.782
Look, what're you doing here?

33:47.850 --> 33:49.283
Ty said he wanted to talk

33:49.351 --> 33:51.185
and I almost believed you
this time.

33:51.253 --> 33:53.655
Amy:
Grant, stop it! Stop it!

33:53.723 --> 33:55.289
Cut it out! Cut it out!

33:56.225 --> 33:57.726
Stop it! Stop it!

33:58.661 --> 34:02.162
Blair, you tell Grant
the truth or I will!

34:11.438 --> 34:12.505
(Phone beeps)

34:14.676 --> 34:15.742
(Sighs)

34:21.481 --> 34:23.783
<i>Tim: Well, I could've used your help
with that cattle today.</i>

34:23.851 --> 34:25.284
Caleb wasn't good for anything.

34:25.351 --> 34:29.589
Well, I spent the day
helping Lou... cook.

34:29.657 --> 34:30.623
She wasn't feeling well.

34:30.690 --> 34:32.223
What's going on with her?

34:32.291 --> 34:33.391
I mean, one minute she's angry,

34:33.458 --> 34:34.927
the next minute she's sobbing.

34:34.994 --> 34:37.328
She's about as irritable
as a woman can be.

34:37.396 --> 34:40.799
Oh, my gosh, you guys,
it's so obvious!

34:40.867 --> 34:42.935
She's probably pregnant.

34:45.404 --> 34:48.906
But this isn't me talking
to either of you.

34:53.612 --> 34:54.879
Yes, I'm late,

34:54.947 --> 34:56.313
but I've also been
flying around the world,

34:56.380 --> 34:58.683
and stressed out and...

34:58.750 --> 35:00.217
You know what?
This is definitely on the list

35:00.285 --> 35:02.319
of things I do not want
to talk to my dad

35:02.387 --> 35:04.054
and my grandfather about.

35:04.121 --> 35:05.755
Well, all we're saying is...

35:07.625 --> 35:09.626
All we're saying

35:09.694 --> 35:10.994
is that we think
you should get checked out.

35:11.062 --> 35:13.863
Go see a doctor.
It's probably nothing,

35:13.931 --> 35:15.065
just do it.

35:15.132 --> 35:18.101
This is silly.
I don't need to.

35:20.737 --> 35:21.904
(Resigned sigh)
Oh...

35:21.972 --> 35:24.673
Okay, I'll go.
Are you satisfied?

35:24.741 --> 35:26.976
Tim: Be careful.
Lou: Dad!

35:30.513 --> 35:32.081
(Door opens)
Hey, I got your text.

35:32.148 --> 35:33.616
(Door bangs shut)

35:34.718 --> 35:35.917
What's all this?

35:36.852 --> 35:39.220
Candles, twinkling lights.

35:41.156 --> 35:43.424
It worked for you, didn't it?

35:43.492 --> 35:44.792
Ash, I...

35:44.860 --> 35:45.927
No.

35:49.598 --> 35:51.265
It's my turn.

35:52.399 --> 35:54.334
Caleb...

35:54.401 --> 35:56.402
I love you

35:56.470 --> 35:59.372
and I want to be with you.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.674
You do?

36:02.243 --> 36:04.978
I want to be with you too.

36:07.548 --> 36:09.982
Caleb Odell...

36:10.050 --> 36:12.618
Would you be
my lawfully wedded husband...

36:12.686 --> 36:14.954
(Chuckles)
For real this time?

36:15.022 --> 36:18.190
Yes. I will.

36:26.666 --> 36:27.732
(Happy sigh)

36:43.281 --> 36:44.314
Blair:
Is your hand okay?

36:44.382 --> 36:45.883
Grant:
Yeah, probably.

36:45.950 --> 36:47.151
Blair:
Grant, I'm so sorry.

36:52.791 --> 36:54.058
(Door bangs shut)

36:54.993 --> 36:58.661
So, Grant and Blair,
all is forgiven?

37:01.131 --> 37:03.365
Yeah, it seems like.

37:15.678 --> 37:18.546
You really liked her,
didn't you?

37:18.614 --> 37:20.681
Before all this happened,

37:20.749 --> 37:22.349
yeah.

37:22.417 --> 37:25.753
We were good friends,
all of us.

37:25.821 --> 37:29.190
And you were attracted
to her, right?

37:30.125 --> 37:32.927
Ty, just be honest with me.

37:37.397 --> 37:38.732
Okay, I was.

37:39.666 --> 37:41.434
But I backed off.
I didn't let it...

37:41.501 --> 37:43.302
Let it what?

37:43.370 --> 37:45.271
I didn't go there.

37:46.207 --> 37:48.341
Wow! Good for you.

37:48.408 --> 37:49.876
At least I took the high road.

37:49.944 --> 37:53.045
The high road?
As opposed to what?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.080
Are we talking about me
and Chase here?

37:55.148 --> 37:57.382
Is that what this is about?

37:57.450 --> 37:59.684
Is it?
Well, you kissed him, didn't you?

37:59.753 --> 38:00.919
He kissed me, Ty!

38:00.987 --> 38:02.788
You kissed him back!

38:02.856 --> 38:04.957
You told me you did!
You admitted it!

38:05.024 --> 38:06.991
So what,
I didn't take the high road?

38:07.059 --> 38:08.192
Is that what you're saying?
That I wanted to?

38:08.260 --> 38:11.262
Well, you must have.
You went there.

38:11.329 --> 38:13.497
So, it's that simple, is it?

38:13.565 --> 38:17.869
Don't think I didn't notice
your attitude with Soraya...

38:17.936 --> 38:19.703
All that crap about
her going out with Chase.

38:19.772 --> 38:21.639
What are you talking about?

38:21.706 --> 38:23.640
That wasn't concern.
What was it then, Ty?

38:23.707 --> 38:25.275
You were jealous!

38:25.342 --> 38:26.476
You still had a thing
for the guy.

38:26.543 --> 38:28.678
No, this is not about me!

38:28.746 --> 38:30.881
This is about you and Blair!

38:30.948 --> 38:32.215
Okay, and don't you tell me
that you didn't lead her on,

38:32.283 --> 38:33.616
because you did.

38:33.684 --> 38:34.584
She wouldn't have come onto you
if you hadn't have.

38:34.652 --> 38:35.986
And you didn't lead Chase on?!

38:36.053 --> 38:38.588
At least I told you.

38:38.656 --> 38:40.222
What do you want me to do,
Amy?!

38:40.290 --> 38:44.359
I don't know, Ty.
Whatever you want to do!

38:46.863 --> 38:48.497
I think we're done.

38:48.564 --> 38:50.465
I can't do this.

38:53.003 --> 38:54.670
Maybe we are.

38:56.305 --> 38:58.372
There's no maybes.

39:18.286 --> 39:21.788
(Dexter grunts and snorts)

39:31.732 --> 39:35.001
(Slightly distorted hoofbeats)

39:37.804 --> 39:40.273
(Dexter grunts)

39:41.909 --> 39:45.377
(Dexter grunts and snorts,
birds sing)

39:54.720 --> 39:57.122
Grant:
So, we're taking off.

39:58.425 --> 40:00.824
I bet you'll be glad
to see our backs, huh?

40:04.329 --> 40:05.963
Look...

40:06.031 --> 40:08.199
I'm sorry, man.

40:08.267 --> 40:09.833
Really, I...

40:09.901 --> 40:13.137
We're sorry for
the trouble we caused.

40:15.340 --> 40:16.573
You guys are okay though,
right?

40:17.942 --> 40:19.943
Yeah, we're fine.

40:24.915 --> 40:28.118
<i>(Dexter whinnies,
hoofbeats thud)</i>

40:31.222 --> 40:32.621
Do something!
Go over there!

40:32.689 --> 40:33.922
You can't just do nothing!

40:34.857 --> 40:36.758
(Dexter breathes hard)

40:45.135 --> 40:46.569
So, I got news.

40:47.504 --> 40:51.473
I'm getting married,
but this time for real.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.174
What are you doing?

40:53.242 --> 40:54.309
I'm packing.

40:55.377 --> 40:56.511
Why?

40:57.446 --> 41:00.415
(Tearful)
Amy and I called it quits.

41:00.483 --> 41:01.549
(Chuckles)

41:02.684 --> 41:04.585
You're kidding, right?

41:04.652 --> 41:06.386
No, I'm not kidding.

41:07.855 --> 41:09.723
Y-you can't!
You guys are happy!

41:11.559 --> 41:13.026
(Bag slams against the wall)

41:13.094 --> 41:14.761
Ty:
(Breathes hard)

41:22.035 --> 41:23.536
(Shaky inhale)

41:23.604 --> 41:26.272
Where are you gonna stay?

41:27.274 --> 41:28.874
(Exhales heavily)

41:28.942 --> 41:30.075
I don't know.

41:39.718 --> 41:41.253
Val:
Oh, Ashley, no!

41:42.188 --> 41:44.556
Don't rush into this again!

41:44.624 --> 41:47.626
Look, you've gotta trust me.

41:48.894 --> 41:52.229
I need you to be
with me on this.

41:54.098 --> 41:56.634
Do you have any idea
how much it hurt

41:56.701 --> 41:59.136
when you ran off with him?

41:59.204 --> 42:01.938
I didn't mean to hurt you.

42:04.042 --> 42:05.609
Mom, please.

42:06.811 --> 42:08.645
This time will be different.

42:08.712 --> 42:12.515
Oh, yeah, you're damned right
it will be.

42:14.918 --> 42:16.286
If you're so bound
and determined

42:16.353 --> 42:18.921
to go through with this...

42:18.989 --> 42:20.356
I'm with you.

42:20.424 --> 42:23.092
(Tearful)
Thank you, mom.

42:24.327 --> 42:27.262
But, Ashley,
I want to be part of it.

42:27.330 --> 42:29.164
I want you to be too.

42:29.232 --> 42:32.167
(Sighs heavily)
I must be crazy.

42:33.102 --> 42:34.469
Caleb loves me.

42:35.405 --> 42:36.572
He looks after me,

42:36.639 --> 42:39.774
and he's changed
since we got married...

42:39.842 --> 42:41.576
Or thought we were.

42:42.511 --> 42:43.844
He's responsible,

42:43.912 --> 42:45.613
and he thinks of both of us

42:45.681 --> 42:48.482
before he makes a decision.
