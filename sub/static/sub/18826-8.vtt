14:26.583 --> 14:28.959
I mean, we are

14:26.583 --> 14:28.959
the exact same age.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.834
- [laughs]

14:29.000 --> 14:30.834
Dawn, relax.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.959
My mom says it happens

14:30.875 --> 14:32.959
at different times

14:33.000 --> 14:34.417
for different people.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.291
It hasn't happened to me yet.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.875
Maybe it won't happen

14:36.333 --> 14:38.875
to you for a while.

14:38.917 --> 14:40.834
- Oh, good.

14:38.917 --> 14:40.834
I was worried

14:40.875 --> 14:43.166
just 'cause I have a little bit

14:40.875 --> 14:43.166
of hair growing on my legs.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.750
- A little bit of hair

14:43.208 --> 14:45.750
doesn't mean anything.

14:45.792 --> 14:49.250
Let's take a look.

14:49.291 --> 14:53.083
Well, you have to pull down

14:49.291 --> 14:53.083
your socks so I can see.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.458
- I'm not wearing socks.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.291
- Oh.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.875
- Oh, no.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.667
Ugh, this is all

14:59.917 --> 15:02.667
so confusing and embarrassing.

15:02.709 --> 15:03.750
I mean, there's

15:02.709 --> 15:03.750
so many boys here.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.458
What if they see?

15:05.500 --> 15:09.166
- They can't see

15:05.500 --> 15:09.166
what's not there.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.625
- Of course!

15:09.208 --> 15:11.625
Perfect.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.875
- Uh, you know

15:11.667 --> 15:13.875
how to do this, right?

15:13.917 --> 15:16.458
- How hard can it be?

15:17.709 --> 15:21.959
[howling]

15:22.000 --> 15:23.375
- Is that Dawn?

15:23.417 --> 15:25.083
- Do you think she's

15:23.417 --> 15:25.083
changing too?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.834
- [gasps]

15:26.875 --> 15:28.166
- Are you okay?

15:28.208 --> 15:29.542
- What happened

15:28.208 --> 15:29.542
to your leg?

15:29.583 --> 15:31.417
- Uh, b-d-d--nothing.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.417
I--

15:31.458 --> 15:33.125
- Uh, got bit.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.583
- Yeah, no biggie.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.041
- [gasps]

15:38.834 --> 15:39.875
- Oh, it's a biggie.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.166
She got bit,

15:39.917 --> 15:42.166
just like Dicky!

15:42.208 --> 15:44.291
- We're going to need

15:42.208 --> 15:44.291
a bigger vault!

15:44.333 --> 15:45.834
[both screaming]

15:48.500 --> 15:51.041
<i>- [whistling]</i>

15:51.083 --> 15:53.875
- Ricky, I got your text!

15:51.083 --> 15:53.875
What do you want?

15:56.792 --> 15:59.291
[sighs] Look, if this is

15:56.792 --> 15:59.291
your lame attempt to scare me,

15:59.333 --> 16:01.250
I'm not in the mood,

15:59.333 --> 16:01.250
and it's not working.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.208
- This isn't about the scare.

16:04.250 --> 16:07.166
We know what's

16:04.250 --> 16:07.166
really happening to you.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.291
- [chuckles nervously]

16:07.208 --> 16:09.291
What are you talking about?

16:09.333 --> 16:13.166
I'm totally normal

16:09.333 --> 16:13.166
hairless Dawn.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.125
- Come on,

16:13.208 --> 16:15.125
we're quads.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.166
You can't hide stuff like this

16:15.166 --> 16:17.166
from us.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.208
- [sighs]

16:19.000 --> 16:21.208
Okay, fine.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.709
Look, I didn't want

16:21.250 --> 16:23.709
this to happen,

16:23.750 --> 16:25.291
but it's happening,

16:23.750 --> 16:25.291
and I don't know what to do.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.834
- Don't worry.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.834
We love you.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.625
We're here for you,

16:27.875 --> 16:30.625
and we're going to help you.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.166
- Aww, that's so sweet.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.375
- But we're not going

16:32.208 --> 16:33.375
to touch you.

16:33.417 --> 16:34.834
- Except to do this!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.333
Ha.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.333
- What are you guys doing?

16:38.375 --> 16:42.000
Let me out of here!

16:38.375 --> 16:42.000
- Stay away.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.625
- Dicky?

16:42.041 --> 16:43.625
- I mean it.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.917
Don't come any closer.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.917
- Trust me, I'm not.

16:45.959 --> 16:47.750
I'm not going anywhere

16:45.959 --> 16:47.750
near you.

16:47.792 --> 16:49.750
- I don't blame you.

16:49.792 --> 16:51.834
I'm a monster.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.250
- I know.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.333
Look, and don't tell anyone,

16:53.291 --> 16:55.333
but...

16:55.375 --> 16:57.709
I'm going through the same thing

16:55.375 --> 16:57.709
you are.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.250
- Really?

16:59.291 --> 17:01.542
Stay away from me,

16:59.291 --> 17:01.542
you vile beast!

17:02.291 --> 17:03.834
- Stop it!

17:02.291 --> 17:03.834
I don't smell!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.542
- Smell?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.542
This is to stop you

17:05.583 --> 17:07.083
from changing into a werewolf!

17:12.792 --> 17:13.750
- A werewolf?

17:15.083 --> 17:16.959
That is deodorant, Dicky,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.417
to keep you from smelling.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.250
You're not turning

17:19.834 --> 17:21.250
into a werewolf.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.458
You're turning into...

17:24.125 --> 17:25.375
a man.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.667
- A man?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.667
Sweet.

17:27.709 --> 17:30.917
[growling]

17:30.959 --> 17:32.625
- What are you doing?

17:32.667 --> 17:33.959
- Becoming a man.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.709
This is what men do.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.417
[growls]

17:35.750 --> 17:37.417
Come on, growl with me.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.625
- No.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.625
- If I'm becoming a man,

17:39.667 --> 17:41.083
you're becoming a woman.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.959
Give me a woman growl.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.959
- No.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.667
- Come on.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.667
[growls]

17:44.709 --> 17:46.875
If I have to go through this,

17:44.709 --> 17:46.875
you do too.

17:46.917 --> 17:48.625
- [sighs]

17:48.667 --> 17:50.625
[growls meekly]

17:50.667 --> 17:52.959
- Come on, woman,

17:50.667 --> 17:52.959
you can do better than that.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.291
- [growls meekly]

17:53.000 --> 17:54.291
- [growls]

17:54.333 --> 17:55.542
- [growls]

17:55.583 --> 17:58.375
[both growling]

17:58.417 --> 18:00.875
- Whoo, we locked them

17:58.417 --> 18:00.875
in there just in time.

18:00.917 --> 18:01.625
- Oh, yeah.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.375
[both growling]

18:04.417 --> 18:05.875
- Okay,

18:04.417 --> 18:05.875
this is weird.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.166
But thank you.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.166
Now help me look for a way out.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.750
- Hey, there's a vent.

18:13.792 --> 18:17.208
- We can climb out.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.875
- [grunts]

18:17.250 --> 18:18.875
- Okay.

18:18.917 --> 18:22.041
But before we get in that

18:18.917 --> 18:22.041
very small space together,

18:22.083 --> 18:24.917
you need some Silver Bullet.

18:24.959 --> 18:26.125
[gags]

18:30.333 --> 18:33.083
Why is this stuff

18:30.333 --> 18:33.083
so sticky?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.583
Dicky,

18:36.583 --> 18:38.583
this isn't Silver Bullet.

18:38.625 --> 18:42.000
This is the spray glue Dad used

18:38.625 --> 18:42.000
to decorate the store.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.041
- Oops.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.959
- Okay, whatever.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.959
Just forget it.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.500
Now let's get out of here.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.166
- [grunts]

18:55.500 --> 18:57.166
[snaps fingers]

18:59.208 --> 19:01.250
Where do you think

18:59.208 --> 19:01.250
this vent leads?

19:01.291 --> 19:02.458
- Probably somewhere

19:01.291 --> 19:02.458
in the store.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.709
Come on.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.792
[both screaming]

19:05.834 --> 19:08.083
[crash]

19:09.750 --> 19:11.208
Or into a dumpster.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.417
- Oh, no-no-no, Squishy.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.417
No more hot dogs for you.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.417
[dog growls]

19:16.458 --> 19:18.500
You've already got some

19:16.458 --> 19:18.500
nasty wiener toots.

19:21.917 --> 19:23.083
[dog whimpers]

19:28.041 --> 19:29.959
- Have you guys seen Dawn?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.625
We've got a Teddy of Terror

19:30.000 --> 19:32.625
to win and she's disappeared.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.083
- I haven't seen her.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.083
Have you seen her?

19:34.125 --> 19:35.250
- Seen who?

19:34.125 --> 19:35.250
- Dawn.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.291
- Dawn who?

19:37.333 --> 19:39.333
- You know darn well

19:37.333 --> 19:39.333
Dawn who.

19:39.375 --> 19:40.583
- Something strange

19:39.375 --> 19:40.583
is going on here,

19:40.625 --> 19:42.625
'cause we can't find

19:40.625 --> 19:42.625
Dicky either.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.875
- That's it.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.875
We gotta tell them.

19:45.917 --> 19:49.500
Dicky and Dawn were bitten

19:45.917 --> 19:49.500
and are turning into werewolves.

19:49.542 --> 19:52.166
- Come on, we're on

19:49.542 --> 19:52.166
the same team, remember?

19:52.208 --> 19:53.625
- Yeah, why are you

19:52.208 --> 19:53.625
trying to scare us?

19:53.667 --> 19:56.208
- Oh, please,

19:53.667 --> 19:56.208
we're not buying this little

19:56.250 --> 19:58.458
"you're even scaring us"

19:56.250 --> 19:58.458
routine.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.625
- Yeah,

19:58.500 --> 20:00.625
and everyone knows

20:00.667 --> 20:03.583
there's no such thing

20:00.667 --> 20:03.583
as werewolves.

20:03.625 --> 20:07.417
[both groaning]

20:07.458 --> 20:10.709
all: Werewolves!

20:10.750 --> 20:12.125
- That way.

20:15.709 --> 20:17.792
- [in demonic voice]

20:15.709 --> 20:17.792
I'm gonna rip out your heart.

20:17.834 --> 20:19.125
[both scream]

20:25.041 --> 20:26.792
both: Cockroaches!

20:26.834 --> 20:29.417
[both scream]

20:29.458 --> 20:30.792
[clang]

20:30.834 --> 20:31.875
[whoosh and thud]

20:31.917 --> 20:34.542
[splatting]

20:34.583 --> 20:36.583
- [groans]

20:36.625 --> 20:38.250
Yes!

20:38.291 --> 20:39.709
It worked!

20:41.333 --> 20:43.917
- Come on, guys.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.917
It's just us--ow.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.458
- We're not monsters.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.417
[both groaning and howling]

20:51.917 --> 20:53.875
- Guys,

20:51.917 --> 20:53.875
what is going on?

20:54.375 --> 20:56.792
- We accidentally sprayed

20:54.375 --> 20:56.792
ourselves with glue--ah--

20:56.834 --> 20:58.500
and then fell

20:56.834 --> 20:58.500
into the dumpster.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.625
- And it's filled

20:58.542 --> 21:00.625
with dog hair.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.291
- Aha!

21:02.333 --> 21:06.041
- And dog collars...

21:06.083 --> 21:09.083
[both howling]

21:09.125 --> 21:11.375
all: Ohh...

21:12.166 --> 21:14.500
- Wait, but what about

21:12.166 --> 21:14.500
Natlee's brother?

21:14.542 --> 21:16.166
We heard you

21:14.542 --> 21:16.166
through the vent.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.083
You said he got bitten

21:16.208 --> 21:18.083
and ate your parents

21:18.125 --> 21:19.834
outside your home.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.917
- I said he got<i> zits</i>

21:19.875 --> 21:21.917
and ate my parents

21:21.959 --> 21:24.458
<i>out of</i> house and home.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.208
- Huh.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.208
Well, that makes more sense.

21:28.250 --> 21:31.125
- He was just maturing.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.917
Just like we're starting to.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.917
Just like you all will.

21:34.959 --> 21:37.458
all: Cool!

21:37.500 --> 21:39.709
- It was pretty funny,

21:37.500 --> 21:39.709
though.

21:39.750 --> 21:42.000
You guys should've seen

21:39.750 --> 21:42.000
the looks on your faces.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.709
- Yeah, you were all like...

21:44.709 --> 21:46.750
- We weren't all like...

21:46.792 --> 21:50.208
- Yeah, we're way too old
