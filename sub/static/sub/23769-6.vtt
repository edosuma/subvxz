00:13.560 --> 00:15.480
Hello? Who is this?

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
Hayley?

00:17.880 --> 00:20.840
Daniel? Whose number is this?

00:21.560 --> 00:25.200
Uh, it's my mom's phone, I think.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.040
I don't understand.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.160
[Judy]  I got the ice!

00:28.920 --> 00:30.280
I have to hang up.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.920
I'll just get this in the...
Oh. What happened here?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.080
[sighs] I knocked over your bag.
I... I'll put everything back in.

00:38.160 --> 00:43.600
Okay. There we go. Bam, bam. Okay.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.600
So, uh, what is that?

00:47.080 --> 00:50.000
This? It's a make-up compact.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.240
You know,
this doesn't just happen by magic.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.560
[theme music playing]

01:16.320 --> 01:18.720
I can't believe you're leaving so soon.
You just got here.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.160
I know, I've just got
a lot of classes tomorrow.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.240
I miss you already.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.600
Aw, sweetie.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.520
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.240
[sighing] So I guess we need to talk...

01:52.480 --> 01:55.240
Look, we both know
that something is going on here.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.960
Otherwise, you wouldn't have showed up.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.760
So where'd you find that number?

02:03.600 --> 02:06.240
I found a secret safe in my mom's bedroom.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.160
And inside there was a note
with a phone number on it.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.880
[sighs]

02:11.920 --> 02:13.880
I only happened to be near that thing
when it rang.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.640
"It"?

02:16.800 --> 02:19.160
Uh, it's not a normal phone.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.200
It's some weird device
I found in my mom's bag.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.160
Okay. What was she doing with it?

02:23.880 --> 02:25.360
I have no idea.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.680
[scoffs]

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You don't know much
about your mom, do you?

02:30.080 --> 02:32.680
Doesn't seem like you know much
about yours, either.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.560
Look, you're not crazy about me,
and the feeling is mutual,

02:37.640 --> 02:39.280
but if we wanna figure out
what's going on here,

02:39.360 --> 02:40.440
we're gonna have to work together.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.760
What?

02:47.800 --> 02:52.200
Listen, I've been injured for a long time.
We have a game in three days.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.320
So?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.560
So I think this is a little much
for me to handle right now.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.800
Fine, whatever.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.000
I'm glad to see
you've got your priorities in order.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.440
Hayley, wait!

03:13.680 --> 03:14.960
You're right.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.920
Something is going on.
We have to figure out what it is.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.840
So now you do want to help?

03:28.760 --> 03:32.160
My mom always told me
I was destined for great things in life.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.880
That I was special.

03:36.440 --> 03:40.880
Everyone in my family,
friends, neighborhood...

03:41.600 --> 03:45.400
[scoffs] They all expect for me
to be this huge success.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.560
I've spent my whole life doing
what everyone expects me to do.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.640
I'm sick of it.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
Look...

03:54.720 --> 03:57.720
you can't spend your whole life
trying to make other people happy.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.360
Including your mom.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.720
But we have to keep this quiet.
No one can know we're working together.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.680
Did you see the new footage
Sophie Cardona sent from the Greenhouse?

04:28.760 --> 04:31.440
I skimmed through it.
There wasn't anything interesting there.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.280
She probably lucked out
on that earthquake footage.

04:34.360 --> 04:38.040
That's what I thought, too,
until I saw this footage from the dance.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.280
[music playing over speakers]

04:47.320 --> 04:49.000
Why are we watching this?

04:49.080 --> 04:52.600
Because... I know that girl.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.240
I saw her at a juvenile court session
I covered.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.520
So?

04:57.600 --> 04:59.640
That girl was sent to prison.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.200
The king is the most important piece,

05:05.280 --> 05:10.240
but he's also the weakest because
he can only move one space at a time.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.920
So he needs his other friends
to protect him.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.160
Yeah. I never thought about it
like that before.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.520
I have to read Shakespeare,
Elie Wiesel, Zora Neale Hurston,

05:21.600 --> 05:25.360
Rachel Bluwstein and Ha Jin by Friday.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.040
Hey. You okay?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.560
And solubility rules. And--

05:31.640 --> 05:35.600
Hey, Woods. How was your trip?
How's your dad?

05:35.680 --> 05:38.560
-Fine. Thanks for asking. Let's go.
-Rain check.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.120
Um, I'm sorry.
Uh, what did you say?

05:45.960 --> 05:47.920
This is a great story, Michelle!

05:50.720 --> 05:52.640
Too bad we can't publish it.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.400
-Why?
-She's a minor.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.440
We'd be violating
confidentiality protections

05:59.520 --> 06:01.520
for juveniles involved
in criminal proceedings.

06:01.600 --> 06:06.200
The only way around it is if we can
somehow get Jackie to confess on camera.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.280
But she won't talk.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.600
If her story goes public,
she goes straight to jail.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.960
What about Cardona?
She worships you.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.520
Can't you get her to get
a confession out of Jackie?

06:14.600 --> 06:17.720
No. It would be like we asked
a student to incriminate her friend.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.000
If anything, it should be me
doing the interview.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.640
Well, that will never happen.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.720
Louis Osmond will never let you
in his school.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.440
What?

06:33.080 --> 06:35.760
I just wanted to thank you
for your cooperation.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.840
What cooperation, exactly?

06:37.920 --> 06:40.800
You exploited my students
by putting them in your tabloid show.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.480
That was never my intention, Mr. Osmond.

06:43.560 --> 06:48.600
Tens of thousands of viewers got an
unfiltered glimpse into your life's work.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.760
Your student, Sophie,
had a youthful perspective

06:52.840 --> 06:54.280
we hadn't seen in a long time.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.080
But you're right...

06:59.640 --> 07:02.880
I shouldn't have aired that piece
without getting your permission first.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.040
Apology accepted.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.040
But you're still angry with me.

07:10.920 --> 07:15.000
That is the last thing I want.
I would love to make it up to you.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.520
How about a free media workshop?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.800
A media workshop?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.520
You're educating future leaders.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.480
Every leader needs to know
how to utilize the media.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.560
It's an interesting idea.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.600
-Schedule it with my assistant.
-Great.

07:36.440 --> 07:40.920
Actually, I have a pretty light
schedule today, which is rare.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.640
How spontaneous are you, Louis?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.440
Guys, it's time for
our weekly house meeting!

07:54.440 --> 07:56.840
Hello? It's time!

08:00.320 --> 08:02.160
You can obviously hear me.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.520
Going for a run?

08:03.600 --> 08:06.400
Yep. Need to break in
these sweet new shoes.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.960
I'll get my sneakers. I'll join you.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.960
Oh, actually, I kind of wanted to
clear my mind. Next time, okay?

08:12.040 --> 08:14.360
-Okay.
-See you later.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.800
Hey, listen, I need your help.
We have to stop this nonsense.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.720
Don't look at me.
I told you not to send in that video.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.880
What's the matter with you?
You're my best friend.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.920
You refused to listen to me.
What kind of friend does that?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.080
[Alex] Hey. I'm here
for the house meeting.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.120
The manual says
a meeting can be officially held

08:34.200 --> 08:35.840
as long as a captain
and two members are present.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.840
Yo, what do you think you're doing?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.960
Parker, we all get the point.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.559
She said she was sorry.
Let's just move on.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.480
Excuse me?

08:46.040 --> 08:48.160
No one asked for your opinion, all right?

08:48.240 --> 08:50.800
She betrayed us and now she has to pay.

08:50.880 --> 08:54.560
Just let it go already!
You're just mad because she rejected you.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.600
What did you say to me?

08:55.680 --> 08:58.640
-[Louis] Everyone, I have a surprise.
-Hey. That's enough. That's enough! Stop!

08:58.720 --> 08:59.880
[Louis] What's going on?

08:59.960 --> 09:03.280
Is this the kind of house meeting
that you're running, Captain?

09:06.080 --> 09:09.080
[Hayley] What is this?
The place that time forgot?

09:09.160 --> 09:12.360
You said you wanted a place
no one goes to in the Greenhouse, right?

09:12.920 --> 09:15.600
It's the old biology lab.
Now it's a storage room.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.000
For storing what? Dead bodies?
I mean, what is that smell?

09:20.080 --> 09:21.600
Formaldehyde.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.160
Ew! Get that away from me!

09:23.240 --> 09:24.560
You're supposed to be tough.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.600
[sighs] Okay.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.960
[straining] No, that's fine.
Don't help me.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.400
You got it.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.800
Okay. [sighs]

09:41.600 --> 09:43.240
Now we can start working.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.760
-Where's the markers?
-Oh.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.880
Here you are.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.000
Do you always carry
a marker around with you?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.320
It's not just a marker.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.200
It's one of Louis's inventions.
Try it out.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.200
Uh... [mumbling]

10:07.360 --> 10:09.120
Oh, my God, it writes!

10:09.200 --> 10:10.560
Now give it back.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.680
[chuckles] What?

10:16.760 --> 10:18.120
It's called quantum ink.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.160
They couldn't market these
'cause each marker costs five grand.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.720
Louis gave it to me for my birthday.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.800
That is so cool, Daniel.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.280
Now the investigation begins.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.520
[Hayley] Okay.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.640
Our moms are somehow connected,
but we don't know how.

10:35.720 --> 10:39.080
We also know that Brooke
started to behave strangely,

10:39.160 --> 10:42.680
and did a full 180 on you and your mom.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.160
-Right so far?
-Right.

10:45.240 --> 10:49.920
We also know that Marcus once checked out
a book on hypnotism from the library,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.800
but that just might be a coincidence.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.200
Well, let's think about this rationally.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.240
Your mom is gone.
We'll never get anything out of my mom.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.800
Brooke, she hasn't been
acting like herself lately, so...

11:05.400 --> 11:07.960
that just leaves Marcus.
He's the weakest link.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.320
Not bad. That makes sense.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.880
That's how us Eagles work.
We think rationally.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.040
You mean you always
pick on the weakest link.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.640
Tough crowd.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.800
And I used to be the LAPD beat reporter.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.920
[sighs] I'm sorry,
this is so embarrassing.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.760
You know journalists are among the most
hated professions in America, right?

11:37.400 --> 11:40.440
We rank worse than IRS tax auditors.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.160
You need a tough skin
to be a true journalist.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.520
Uncovering the truth
will always earn you enemies.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.280
[chuckles] That is so good to hear,
coming from you.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.560
So about this workshop I'm doing.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.560
I could use your help,
if you're up for it.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.480
Yes, of course. Anything.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.360
I wanna do a few interviews,
but I don't know anyone.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.720
So could you choose
the most interesting students

12:05.800 --> 12:08.120
and do little background checks
on them for me?

12:09.600 --> 12:11.120
[chuckles] Yeah.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.680
Perfect.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.080
My mom was close to Marcus
when she was a student here.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.960
So there is a connection there.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.840
Oh, and Brooke suspected Marcus.
She followed him to the cave that day.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.080
The same cave where Alex and I
saw Judy on the night of the dance.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.720
Okay, Marcus is our lead!

12:30.800 --> 12:32.240
Give me the book.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.640
"The use of hypnosis
for long-term cognitive change."

12:42.480 --> 12:43.880
Think he used this on Brooke?

12:43.960 --> 12:47.080
[sighs] I don't know. This is crazy.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.880
But at least it gives us an explanation
of what happened to her.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.040
Right.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.000
Look! A chapter is missing.
Someone ripped out all the pages!

12:59.080 --> 13:02.040
That's weird. Check the contents
to see what that chapter was about.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.560
"The process of dehypnotization."

13:08.400 --> 13:09.760
You're kidding me, right?

13:11.760 --> 13:12.800
[Louies chime]

13:17.560 --> 13:19.720
Louis wants us all in the exam room.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.840
Perfect timing.

13:27.800 --> 13:31.920
Looking for Hayley, I presume?
Why are you so obsessed with her?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.200
As captain, it is my job to make sure
all my Ravens are here.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.240
Don't you think it's killing me,
seeing how you look at her?

13:39.320 --> 13:40.320
What?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.160
I'm not blind, Leo.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.760
I know you have feelings for Hayley.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.440
And it's bloody hard to be the only one
here working for this relationship.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.960
God, sometimes I wish I let her drown.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.400
Hang on.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.400
How long were you at the beach
before I showed up?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.080
I don't know. I wasn't wearing a watch.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.000
You saw Hayley before I did, didn't you?

14:03.480 --> 14:06.120
[chuckles] I was just kidding.
Hello, sarcasm.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.040
No. I know you, Aspen.
You don't just kid around.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.600
You saw her and did nothing.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.240
Hey, Leo. It's so not true.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.160
You know, I'm so glad we talked.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.400
We should go before someone notices.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.200
Wait. If Marcus used this book
to hypnotize Brooke,

14:26.960 --> 14:29.240
then that missing chapter
is the only way to bring her back.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.920
-He must have taken it.
-Maybe the book is online?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.240
It's out of print.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.640
And even if we did find it somewhere,

14:35.720 --> 14:37.480
we don't have time
for it to be shipped over.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.440
Maybe he's hiding
the chapter in his office?

14:42.040 --> 14:44.360
-[jingling]
-What's that key?

14:44.440 --> 14:46.720
It's a master key.
It can open any door in the school.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.920
How'd you get it?

14:48.000 --> 14:51.400
Louis gave it to me when I was captain
in case the Louie network went down,

14:51.480 --> 14:52.560
as a safety measure.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.600
And you didn't think of giving it back
when you stopped being captain?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.000
Never mind.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.920
The important thing is that
we can break into Marcus' room

15:02.000 --> 15:03.120
and find the missing chapter.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.800
But how do we make sure
Marcus isn't in his room?

15:06.880 --> 15:09.440
I don't know.
I'll think of something. Let's go.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.600
Wait.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.480
Okay.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.080
Today, as a leader,

15:21.160 --> 15:23.200
if you don't know
how to deal with the media,

15:23.280 --> 15:25.240
you have no chance of reaching people.

15:25.320 --> 15:30.480
During the next hour, you will experience
a one-on-one interview with me.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.040
This will not be a softball interview...

15:32.120 --> 15:36.640
Hey, why were you late?
Why didn't you answer my texts? How's Dad?

15:36.720 --> 15:38.160
Oh, he's fine. Sorry.

15:38.240 --> 15:42.960
This is your chance to practice answering
my questions without falling into traps,

15:43.040 --> 15:47.600
losing your cool, and most importantly,
without being boring.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
[all chuckle]

15:50.600 --> 15:52.480
Um, and before we start,

15:52.560 --> 15:55.640
I just wanna thank Sophie Cardona for
helping me out with the background checks.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.800
Thank you, Sophie.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.480
Why are you filming this?

15:59.400 --> 16:01.560
You're Parker, right?

16:01.640 --> 16:03.200
It's all part of the workshop.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.400
It's all about getting used
to being on camera.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.840
It's not a problem, right?

16:08.920 --> 16:10.800
-It's fine.
-Oh, good.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.680
You know what? Since we've already met,

16:13.760 --> 16:16.280
why don't you join me
as my first interviewee?

16:16.360 --> 16:18.000
Parker Grant, come on up, please.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.360
How did you feel when
you saw yourself in Sophie's news item

16:33.440 --> 16:36.240
after you confessed your feelings for her?

16:40.080 --> 16:42.040
[sighs] I felt like crap.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.840
An honest answer,
but it makes you a target.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.280
It could end up online
as a humiliating meme,

16:50.360 --> 16:51.640
which would ruin your image.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.800
Hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.120
Try again.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.560
Um, I don't know, uh...

16:57.640 --> 17:00.320
I trusted my friend,
and she betrayed me, okay?

17:01.320 --> 17:04.440
And that's what caused you
to recruit everyone to ostracize her?

17:05.040 --> 17:05.960
What?

17:08.640 --> 17:12.119
-You didn't honestly run into her--
-Answer my question, Parker.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.960
You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm done.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.400
Getting defensive is never a good idea.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.280
A smart leader keeps his cool.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.800
You know, this is why
people hate the media.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.319
-[scattered applause]
-[student] Yeah!

17:28.400 --> 17:30.720
Hey, I have a headache.
I'm gonna get some aspirin.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.280
[Louis] All right, quiet down, please.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.400
All right. Who's next, Michelle?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.240
Did you see that?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.360
Seriously, I think something's going on

17:39.440 --> 17:42.240
-between my sister and Daniel.
-I... I want to listen to this.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.200
So what's it like to be a couple
in the Greenhouse?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.960
Look, I don't wanna discuss
my private life with you.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.680
Good leaders know how to share
some of their personal lives

18:09.760 --> 18:11.520
to make the public identify with them.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.480
That's great, but, um--

18:13.560 --> 18:16.120
Do you mind if I take it from here, Lee?

18:17.160 --> 18:21.360
Michelle, the truth is, it's not easy
being a couple at the Greenhouse.

18:21.440 --> 18:25.640
Especially when your partner's captain.
So much responsibility, Michelle.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.960
See how cleverly Aspen uses my name.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.240
There is nothing an interviewer loves
more than hearing their own name.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.760
It can subconsciously earn you points.

18:35.840 --> 18:39.040
But your relationship seems strong enough
to get you through tough times.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.440
Tell me about the time you saved
Hayley and Leo from drowning.

18:44.760 --> 18:49.240
Oh, um... I was standing there
at the beach when it all happened,

18:49.320 --> 18:53.040
minding my own business when,
out of nowhere,

18:53.120 --> 18:55.600
I saw them in the water,
caught in a whirlpool.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.920
It was horrendous.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.720
So I didn't think at all.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.560
Just the thought of losing this guy.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.920
It tore me up inside. I just...
I just jumped straight into action.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.720
I can't do this anymore.
I can't go on like this.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.440
With the interview or with Aspen?

19:18.480 --> 19:19.640
With both.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.200
Michelle, I think we've learned
enough for one day.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.200
I just have one more interview.
Jackie Sanders?

19:31.280 --> 19:33.000
That's strange.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.640
I didn't do
any background research on her.

20:06.520 --> 20:10.040
So, Jackie. Are you happy
being a Greenhouse student?

20:10.120 --> 20:11.480
Yes.

20:12.960 --> 20:17.200
Never answer with one word.
It sounds terse and dull.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.440
Try to answer with
at least three sentences.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.440
Um, I'm happy, elated.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.160
Honestly, I feel fantastic.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.880
There's no greater honor than being
part of this renowned institution,

20:28.960 --> 20:33.880
standing majestically along the Santa Ynez
cliffs overlooking the ocean.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.640
-[Hayley] Come on, Daniel!
-I don't see it.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.960
Check over there!

20:48.280 --> 20:49.240
There's nothing.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.800
Shh! Quieter.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.720
So, when did you first hear
about the Greenhouse?

21:14.480 --> 21:16.080
I think it was last year.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.720
And did you take the entrance exams
like everyone else?

21:18.800 --> 21:20.560
Sure. Why?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.600
You did come to the admissions exam
in handcuffs.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.920
You'd been sent to prison
just a day earlier, weren't you?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.640
How did you know about that?

21:28.720 --> 21:29.720
That's enough, Michelle.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.360
-Don't answer her, Jackie.
-Weren't you?

21:31.440 --> 21:32.680
I said, that's enough!

21:32.760 --> 21:34.680
You know what?
I was in jail.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.880
I robbed a bank!
You can go to prison for that!

21:36.960 --> 21:38.240
There's a lot of things I'm not proud of.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.200
But thanks to Louis,
I left that in the past.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.160
Are you happy?
Did you get what you want to hear?

21:47.600 --> 21:50.680
I want you out of here. Now.

22:04.040 --> 22:04.880
[gasps]

22:08.520 --> 22:10.800
[Hayley] We have to go. Come on.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.400
[mumbles]

22:22.440 --> 22:23.840
[Louis] Marcus!

22:29.800 --> 22:32.240
I need you to escort
this woman back to her car.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.240
I never wanna see her
on school grounds again.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.840
-Yes!
-Yes!

22:47.920 --> 22:49.160
See?

23:01.920 --> 23:02.920
[crunching]
