WEBVTT

00:05.986 --> 00:08.045
Now, be careful.

00:08.087 --> 00:11.148
These things have booby traps. Booby.

00:11.191 --> 00:12.351
Will do.

00:12.393 --> 00:14.918
And it's a good thing
I have my trusty penknife.

00:14.962 --> 00:16.088
Dean, those are nail clippers.

00:16.129 --> 00:17.654
Got it!

00:19.066 --> 00:20.761
It's treasure!

00:20.801 --> 00:23.531
Brownish chunks of pirate booty!

00:23.571 --> 00:25.061
Hank, that's an old piece of candy.

00:25.105 --> 00:26.094
Booty!

00:26.140 --> 00:28.301
And there's a little guy in there
made out of pipe-cleaners.

00:28.342 --> 00:29.434
Aw, cool. I get that!

00:29.476 --> 00:34.209
It's all macaroni and empty spools
and puffy paint, some yarn...

00:34.248 --> 00:37.012
Felt scraps. Hey!
Packages of googly-eyes!

00:37.051 --> 00:38.143
I'm totally taking these.

00:38.185 --> 00:41.586
Hey, this is interesting.
It's in Sanskrit.

00:41.622 --> 00:43.749
And a dialect I'm not familiar with.

00:43.791 --> 00:45.122
I'm not sure I can read it.

00:45.159 --> 00:46.319
Well, just try.

00:46.360 --> 00:52.265
"It... we have to you
likely the opening now of this chest.

00:52.299 --> 00:57.236
"To all that protect
mine rainy-day craft box...

00:57.271 --> 01:00.707
are cursed, when to not take away...

01:00.741 --> 01:04.973
"things or objects..."
or something like that.

01:05.012 --> 01:08.675
The prepositions and stuff are all screwy...

01:08.716 --> 01:10.911
It's a cursed treasure!

01:15.089 --> 01:17.614
The boys are in trouble.

01:17.658 --> 01:22.425
You have thieved from the sacred craft-bin
of Olee Janeema.

01:22.463 --> 01:24.055
Give him back the googly-eyes!

01:24.098 --> 01:25.588
- You!
- I didn't take 'em!

01:25.633 --> 01:29.000
Now your blood shall flow in his name...

01:30.838 --> 01:32.806
My arm came off.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.637
I can't believe that happened!

01:34.675 --> 01:36.199
Out of the way, boys.

01:36.243 --> 01:39.110
I'm gonna give him something
to really cry about.

01:39.146 --> 01:41.011
Aw, I wanted a piece of him.

01:44.918 --> 01:48.684
Stop! Oh, I'm sorry.

01:48.722 --> 01:50.121
Stop hitting yourself!

01:51.125 --> 01:56.028
Ooh, the terrible hurting!
Ow! Please stop doing that.

01:56.063 --> 01:57.758
Enough!

02:03.804 --> 02:05.465
The Monarch!

02:05.506 --> 02:09.738
While you were wasting your time
castrating a priceless antique...

02:09.776 --> 02:13.269
I have been systematically
feeding babies...

02:13.313 --> 02:15.213
to hungry, mutated puppies!

02:15.249 --> 02:17.114
Not likely, Monarch.

02:17.151 --> 02:18.618
Silence!

02:24.558 --> 02:27.083
You know what this means.
Mecha-shiva.

02:27.127 --> 02:29.459
Mecha-shiva go!

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.778 --> 02:46.609
Oh, no!
Wait a minute!

02:46.647 --> 02:49.047
That's insane!
They're total liars!

02:49.083 --> 02:51.916
I kept my mouth shut when Dean said
he could read Sanskrit.

02:51.952 --> 02:54.580
Then, when Hank said he
wanted a piece of him...

02:54.621 --> 02:57.112
I was, like, fine. Whatever.
But Mecha-shiva?

02:57.157 --> 02:59.819
No way! They are so lying. I'm innocent.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.727
And now, Mr. Monarch,
you'll have your chance.

03:02.763 --> 03:05.926
Order! Order! I will have order!

03:05.966 --> 03:07.627
Mecha-shiva!

03:12.539 --> 03:14.803
Excuse me, gentlemen.

03:14.842 --> 03:16.469
Would this be the courtroom...

03:16.510 --> 03:19.673
where one might attend
"The People v. The Monarch"?

03:19.713 --> 03:23.080
You got the right room, but no one goes
through these doors without clearance.

03:23.117 --> 03:26.575
I'm sure you'll find that I have every right
to attend these proceedings.

03:33.861 --> 03:37.058
I'm in, and I've made a bit of a mess.

03:37.097 --> 03:40.897
Send a cleaner for 375 pounds.

03:40.934 --> 03:42.128
Maybe more.

03:42.169 --> 03:46.105
- So, Hank... it is Hank, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

03:46.140 --> 03:50.839
Well, Hank,
what's it like to be a... liar?

03:50.878 --> 03:53.608
Do you like being a liar,
with pants constantly on fire?

03:53.647 --> 03:56.138
Objection, your honor! Leading.

03:56.183 --> 03:59.243
I'll rephrase that.
Hank, are you a liar?

03:59.286 --> 04:00.583
No, sir.
I don't think so.

04:00.621 --> 04:02.418
- Yes, you are!
- You're the liar!

04:02.456 --> 04:04.617
And may I remind you
that I am rubber and you are glue...

04:04.658 --> 04:07.718
and whatever you say
bounces off of me and sticks to you!

04:07.761 --> 04:10.229
That's it! This court
will recess for one hour.

04:10.264 --> 04:13.233
I want to see the attorneys
in my chamber now!

04:13.267 --> 04:16.100
You're on thin ice here,
but do you get off the ice?

04:16.136 --> 04:19.333
Hell, no! You jump up and down
like a lunatic having a conniption fit.

04:19.373 --> 04:22.069
Now, if it was up to me,
you'd have been in chains an hour ago.

04:22.108 --> 04:24.703
But this is a trial by jury,
and it's up to your peers...

04:24.745 --> 04:27.680
Peers? Peers!
How dare you!

04:27.714 --> 04:29.944
That repulsive display
of humanity out there?

04:29.983 --> 04:31.974
No way!

04:32.019 --> 04:34.044
Oh, look, freak-show decided to show up.

04:34.087 --> 04:38.217
Would you be so kind
as to liberate me from my fetters?

04:38.258 --> 04:40.988
It is a powerful hot in here.

04:48.168 --> 04:51.797
Your Honor, I have some experience...

04:51.839 --> 04:55.798
with these what you might call
super villain-types.

04:55.843 --> 04:58.437
They're a specialty of mine.

04:58.478 --> 05:01.811
What with this condition
I'm sorely afflicted with.

05:01.849 --> 05:03.441
What? You have a condition?
No. No way.

05:03.483 --> 05:06.418
Most of them are wilder
than a peach orchard hog.

05:06.453 --> 05:08.853
But this one here will go down
like all the others.

05:08.889 --> 05:10.754
Yessir, that's a promise.

05:10.791 --> 05:14.921
I'm gonna be working harder than a cat
trying to bury a turd on a marble floor.

05:14.962 --> 05:16.088
Now, that's appealing.

05:16.129 --> 05:18.097
I don't even have to open it.

05:18.131 --> 05:20.599
I can just tell... egg salad.

05:20.634 --> 05:23.603
Fart-sandwiches.
Dean, hold your breath.

05:23.637 --> 05:25.264
We're going in for the cookie.

05:25.305 --> 05:28.206
T-minus three, two, one.

05:28.242 --> 05:31.336
If I knew you could just call
the cops on him...

05:31.378 --> 05:32.936
I would have done it years ago!

05:32.980 --> 05:34.504
Because I'm no sissy. No, sir.

05:34.548 --> 05:38.780
I would just pick up that phone and,
"Officer, there's a man in a butterfly suit...

05:38.819 --> 05:40.684
"shooting my robot with a laser beam."

05:40.721 --> 05:43.588
We'd still be waiting
for the cops to show up.

05:43.624 --> 05:46.821
The police stay out of the way
of the Guild for the most part.

05:46.860 --> 05:49.988
Who do you think supplied the department
with new cruisers last year?

05:50.030 --> 05:51.361
My tax dollars, for one.

05:51.398 --> 05:52.660
Santa Claus, for two.

05:52.699 --> 05:54.064
Keep dreamin'.

05:54.101 --> 05:56.228
No cop would respond to a call like that.

05:56.270 --> 05:59.899
What about a supercop with a jet pack
and a devil-may-care attitude?

05:59.940 --> 06:02.170
The only way the police
would get involved is...

06:02.209 --> 06:03.972
if the Guild screwed with them first.

06:04.011 --> 06:06.502
So when the Monarch
messed with the police...

06:06.546 --> 06:08.275
- he messed with...
- The Guild.

06:08.315 --> 06:09.782
I was gonna say that.

06:09.816 --> 06:11.374
Sovereign...

06:11.418 --> 06:13.443
Many of our operatives are in place.

06:13.487 --> 06:14.977
We await your orders.

06:15.022 --> 06:17.616
Good. Good.

06:17.658 --> 06:20.525
Let us proceed to stage five.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.357
It shall be done.

06:22.396 --> 06:24.694
Great, way to make me look like a tool!

06:24.731 --> 06:25.925
What are you doing back there?

06:25.966 --> 06:27.593
Have you seen my juice-box?

06:27.634 --> 06:28.658
Oh, that was yours?

06:28.702 --> 06:30.033
- I thought that...
- Great. Thanks.

06:30.070 --> 06:32.061
Why did I even bother
putting my initials on it?

06:35.909 --> 06:37.843
How rude of me.

06:37.878 --> 06:39.277
Would you care for some Pez?

06:39.313 --> 06:41.577
Oh... no.

06:41.615 --> 06:43.879
I think they taste too much like soap.

06:43.917 --> 06:48.513
For my next witness,
I would like to call to the stand...

06:48.555 --> 06:50.022
The Monarch!

06:50.057 --> 06:51.922
They are so gonna fry this idiot.

06:53.493 --> 06:55.893
Just get on the stand
and give your testimony.

06:55.929 --> 06:57.419
Oh. OK. Right. Sorry.

06:59.700 --> 07:00.724
How do I, uh?

07:00.767 --> 07:01.995
Oh, any time, Mr. Monarch.

07:02.035 --> 07:03.093
Today would be nice.

07:03.136 --> 07:04.694
OK, I should just go then?

07:04.738 --> 07:05.727
Please!

07:05.772 --> 07:11.301
This all started soon after "The Flight
of the Monarch" was published...

07:11.345 --> 07:15.406
a mean little tell-all book filled with nothing
but lies and pictures of also-lies.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.940
- What the hell is this?
- A book?

07:17.985 --> 07:20.351
No! But you would think it was, right?

07:20.387 --> 07:23.982
You can read it like a book.
Here, I'll show you.

07:24.024 --> 07:28.154
"Rifling through his pockets for change,
the Monarch accidentally launches...

07:28.195 --> 07:31.687
"a sodium-pentothal-tipped dart
deep into his own thigh.

07:31.732 --> 07:34.826
"Upon hearing a girlish symphony
of shrill wails...

07:34.868 --> 07:36.267
"a waitress comes to his aid..."

07:36.303 --> 07:37.429
I told you.

07:37.471 --> 07:39.098
You told me he wouldn't find out.

07:39.139 --> 07:41.767
You're such a dick.
You put his face on the cover!

07:41.808 --> 07:43.207
"...plucking your eyebrows?!"

07:43.243 --> 07:45.711
Oh, it's almost exactly like a book.

07:45.746 --> 07:47.270
There's even some pictures.

07:47.314 --> 07:48.975
Why, here's one of me at Dance-eteria...

07:49.016 --> 07:51.644
making out with Stiv Bators
and Lydia Lunch!

07:51.685 --> 07:55.621
But this is not a book.
This is a suicide note!

07:55.655 --> 07:59.716
Good news! The euthanasia
will be carried out by me.

07:59.760 --> 08:04.720
The author has twenty minutes
to seek my aid before I just kill all of you.

08:04.765 --> 08:09.327
You'll find me in my room... crying.

08:09.369 --> 08:12.770
After a heart-to-heart
with my family of friends...

08:12.806 --> 08:15.104
a confession soon followed.

08:17.811 --> 08:21.406
It must have been hard for him
to come to a man he saw as a mentor...

08:21.448 --> 08:25.350
and confess to penning
such libelous slander.

08:25.385 --> 08:28.718
I was lenient on him.
He punished himself enough.

08:28.755 --> 08:32.714
You should have replaced
his blood with acid after this part.

08:32.759 --> 08:34.852
The sharks won't touch him now.

08:34.895 --> 08:38.092
Thanks, Dr. Girlfriend.
Now you tell me.

08:38.131 --> 08:41.429
Lower the giant hair dryer!

08:41.467 --> 08:43.197
Objection!

08:43.236 --> 08:44.760
On what grounds?

08:44.805 --> 08:46.102
Boring me to tears. Ha!

08:46.139 --> 08:47.766
Relevance, Your Honor.

08:47.808 --> 08:52.677
Mr. Monarch hasn't been charged
with having a book written about him.

08:52.712 --> 08:56.773
He's been charged
with the abduction or maybe, well...

08:56.817 --> 09:00.275
disintegration of a police officer.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.550
I'm getting to that!
Just keep your pants on.

09:02.589 --> 09:04.682
Oh, wait. You can't wear pants, can you?

09:04.724 --> 09:06.817
Overruled.
Continue, Mr. Monarch.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.191
But please get to the point.

09:08.228 --> 09:11.755
But sadly, the repercussions
of "The Flight of the Monarch"...

09:11.798 --> 09:12.890
were far from over.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.730
OK, then who haven't you slept with?

09:14.768 --> 09:15.894
I'm sure that's a shorter list.

09:15.936 --> 09:17.096
Oh, you are insane!

09:17.137 --> 09:20.334
I'm insane? I'm insane?
Look at these!

09:20.373 --> 09:22.466
There's a picture of you
in Monstroso's lap.

09:22.509 --> 09:25.740
That was a party.
Look at his lap... it's huge.

09:25.779 --> 09:27.337
There's, like, five of us on it.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.577
Yeah, right. And here's one of you
skinny dipping with Jim Foetus!

09:30.617 --> 09:32.209
Let me see that.
I don't remember...

09:32.252 --> 09:34.743
And there's a whole collage
of you and Phantom Limb.

09:34.788 --> 09:37.256
All right, fine!
I used to work for him. So what?

09:37.290 --> 09:39.690
Holy crap!
Look at your costume!

09:39.726 --> 09:41.557
What, did Frank Frazetta design it for you?

09:41.595 --> 09:42.823
It's tiny!

09:42.863 --> 09:46.560
I can see your dirty pillows!

09:46.600 --> 09:47.931
I am leaving!

09:47.968 --> 09:49.629
If you can't calm down, I'm leaving.

09:49.669 --> 09:52.297
You can't leave.
I'm throwing you out.

09:52.339 --> 09:56.241
Get out of my cocoon, you whore!

09:57.978 --> 10:01.971
After an amicable parting of the ways,
life went on as usual.

10:02.015 --> 10:06.418
And that was the last time I saw Dr. Girl...

10:06.453 --> 10:08.921
Dr. Ex-Girlfriend!

10:08.955 --> 10:11.924
Good riddance to bad girlfriends, I say.

10:11.958 --> 10:16.292
My guess is about then, well, she was
so sad about her failure to upset me...

10:16.329 --> 10:19.821
that she probably
went crazy, rampage nuts.

10:19.866 --> 10:21.094
He's lying!

10:22.235 --> 10:25.671
Oh, no way. That's a real big surprise.

10:31.043 --> 10:33.409
Good gracious.
What happened to you?

10:33.446 --> 10:35.846
It's a long story. Can I come in?

10:35.881 --> 10:39.339
Of course, of course.
It's horrid out there.

10:39.385 --> 10:41.580
I insist on it.

10:41.620 --> 10:44.145
Dear girl, you're soaked to the bone.

10:44.190 --> 10:47.091
Come sit down and tell me all about it.

10:47.126 --> 10:49.458
Now, let it all out.

10:49.495 --> 10:51.588
I'm just going to get you
some dry clothes.

10:51.630 --> 10:53.097
He threw me out.

10:53.132 --> 10:56.499
After saying the most horrible things,
he threw me out.

10:56.535 --> 10:58.230
The cad! How dare he!

10:58.270 --> 11:01.728
Who does he think he is...
Mr. King Butterfly Man?

11:01.774 --> 11:03.435
Well, I'm nobody's doormat.

11:03.476 --> 11:05.603
Before I met him, I was Lady Au Pair.

11:05.644 --> 11:10.274
I was feared, and I was respected,
and not just by my murderous moppets...

11:10.316 --> 11:11.408
by everyone.

11:11.450 --> 11:12.781
And after that, I was...

11:12.818 --> 11:16.117
Queen Etherea.

11:16.155 --> 11:18.988
Put it on. I want to see you in it again.

11:19.024 --> 11:20.958
Oh, I can't believe you saved it.

11:20.993 --> 11:22.483
What are these hard chunks?

11:22.528 --> 11:23.790
My tears.

11:23.829 --> 11:26.389
Tears? You have to be kidding me!

11:26.432 --> 11:28.229
You know that sick, deformed slob...

11:28.267 --> 11:31.031
you know he was pounding
his invisible meat...

11:31.070 --> 11:32.503
That's it. Objection!

11:32.538 --> 11:35.029
Your honor, I have children listening
to this potty talk!

11:35.074 --> 11:38.840
Sustained. I want that last bit stricken
from the record... and my mind.

11:38.878 --> 11:40.812
Dr. Venture, you might want
to take your sons out.

11:40.846 --> 11:43.781
Not me! There's no way
I'm gonna miss this.

11:43.816 --> 11:45.943
Brock, be a lamb,
and take the boys somewhere.

11:45.985 --> 11:48.476
Aw, come on, Pop.
We're not babies.

11:48.521 --> 11:49.988
Dean told me how he pounds his...

11:50.022 --> 11:51.387
All right. Yeah, boys.

11:51.423 --> 11:57.851
Uh, hey, why don't we go scrounge up
some adventure...

11:57.897 --> 11:59.489
do some, uh...

11:59.532 --> 12:01.932
Control, delay order.
We've lost full containment.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.094
I repeat, delay order.

12:04.136 --> 12:05.433
Copy on delay.

12:05.471 --> 12:07.439
- We are on standby.
- Knew it.

12:07.473 --> 12:08.735
I thought you went to the can.

12:08.774 --> 12:09.832
I did. I'm back.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.467
That was, like, ten seconds ago.

12:11.510 --> 12:13.239
What, are you pissing in the corner?

12:13.279 --> 12:16.737
There's gum in this fountain...
our first clue.

12:16.782 --> 12:19.910
It seems our thirsty mystery man
was a gum-chewer.

12:19.952 --> 12:21.783
Look, Brock. Hank found a clue.

12:21.820 --> 12:22.912
Oh, great.

12:22.955 --> 12:24.354
Boys, don't touch that clue.

12:24.390 --> 12:26.620
That clue was in somebody's mouth.

12:26.659 --> 12:29.287
That clue's filthy.

12:29.328 --> 12:31.228
Now, take your time.

12:31.263 --> 12:35.256
I know this is very upsetting for you.

12:35.301 --> 12:37.201
Would you like a tissue?

12:37.236 --> 12:40.000
It's fine. I have one.

12:42.274 --> 12:43.707
If this is too much for you...

12:43.742 --> 12:46.404
No, please. I want to finish.

12:46.445 --> 12:47.469
Go on, then.

12:49.248 --> 12:52.240
I was there for maybe a half an hour.

12:52.284 --> 12:54.980
We were eating some aged...
something-or-other cheese.

12:55.020 --> 12:56.419
I don't recall what it was.

12:56.455 --> 12:57.786
Asiago.

12:57.823 --> 12:59.586
I developed a love
for this playful provision...

12:59.625 --> 13:01.752
during my stay in Florence, Italy.

13:01.794 --> 13:03.921
It's really nothing more
than a common table cheese...

13:03.963 --> 13:06.523
but I find it a charming yang
to merlot's impish ying.

13:06.565 --> 13:09.591
It tastes like the inside of an old thermos.

13:09.635 --> 13:11.102
Will you knock that off?

13:11.136 --> 13:12.160
Let me get that.

13:12.204 --> 13:14.195
You must be strong.
Remember who you are.

13:14.239 --> 13:16.332
His lies can't hurt you anymore.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.502
Stop that.
We heard you the first time.

13:18.544 --> 13:20.409
I knew you were here!

13:20.446 --> 13:22.710
The henchmen were all,
"She went to her mother's"...

13:22.748 --> 13:26.149
but I knew you went crawling back to him!

13:26.185 --> 13:27.277
Keep your voice down.

13:27.319 --> 13:28.547
Holy crap!
What are you wearing?

13:28.587 --> 13:30.282
Is that your Queen Etherea suit?

13:30.322 --> 13:31.653
You're wearing your old costume now?

13:31.690 --> 13:32.952
My clothes were wet, and he...

13:32.992 --> 13:35.790
I can't believe you're falling
for that floating...

13:35.828 --> 13:37.989
smooth-talking jackass!

13:38.030 --> 13:41.022
I can't even look at you in that... slut...

13:41.066 --> 13:42.465
slut slutty slut suit!

13:42.501 --> 13:44.469
I was wearing this when you first met me.

13:44.503 --> 13:46.801
I don't remember you complaining then.

13:46.839 --> 13:48.466
That's because I had you out of that rag...

13:48.507 --> 13:50.134
within the first five minutes
of meeting you.

13:50.175 --> 13:52.075
I made you the Monarch's!

13:52.111 --> 13:54.579
You are a monster!

13:54.613 --> 13:55.841
All right.

13:55.881 --> 13:56.973
That was supposed to be romantic.

13:57.016 --> 13:58.643
Oh, go to hell!

13:58.684 --> 14:00.982
Fine!

14:01.020 --> 14:04.217
Then he just hung around the yard yelling
till somebody called the cops.

14:04.256 --> 14:06.281
That was all you saw?

14:06.325 --> 14:09.158
Well, I saw the flashing lights
from, I guess, the police...

14:09.194 --> 14:10.957
and I heard some talking. Then...

14:10.996 --> 14:13.624
- Then?
- Then... nothing.

14:17.569 --> 14:19.503
Ow! What the dealy-o?

14:19.538 --> 14:22.166
Saliva is nature's glue.

14:22.207 --> 14:24.198
And raisins are nature's candy!

14:24.243 --> 14:26.143
It's the oldest trick in the book.

14:26.178 --> 14:29.113
If I place a hair between the door
and frame...

14:29.148 --> 14:31.116
- We've been made.
- It works as a burglar alarm.

14:31.150 --> 14:34.449
All we have to do is come back,
and if the hair is gone...

14:34.486 --> 14:36.716
somebody used this door.

14:36.755 --> 14:38.518
Help!

14:38.557 --> 14:41.253
Do not be too hasty entering that room.

14:41.293 --> 14:44.456
I had Taco Bell for lunch!

14:44.496 --> 14:50.662
Expert witness Dr. Byron Orpheus
has arrived!

14:50.703 --> 14:53.228
The hair's gone! A clue!

14:53.272 --> 14:55.832
It was Dr. O. The whole time.

14:55.874 --> 14:57.637
I wonder what that means.

14:57.676 --> 15:00.076
It means Dr. Orpheus had to take a dump.

15:00.112 --> 15:02.637
So, nice job.
Case closed.

15:02.681 --> 15:04.410
Place your right hand on the...

15:04.450 --> 15:06.918
How sweet. A Bible.

15:06.952 --> 15:11.821
Well, if you don't mind, sir,
I have a book of my own for this little ritual.

15:11.857 --> 15:15.224
Keep your fingers clear of its mouth.

15:15.260 --> 15:16.488
He's a nibbler.

15:16.528 --> 15:18.359
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

15:18.397 --> 15:22.390
and nothing but the truth,
so help you... uh, whoever?

15:22.434 --> 15:24.459
I swear it.

15:24.503 --> 15:30.408
Dr. Orpheus, could you tell the court
what it is that you do?

15:30.442 --> 15:32.410
You're a type of magician?

15:32.444 --> 15:35.311
Oh, they have no idea what they're in for.

15:35.347 --> 15:41.616
Well, if you must call me that, yes.
But if you are after mere parlor tricks...

15:41.653 --> 15:44.121
you will be sorely disappointed.

15:44.156 --> 15:49.788
For if I reach behind your ear,
it will not be a nickel I pull out...

15:49.828 --> 15:51.853
but your very soul!

15:51.897 --> 15:53.296
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

15:53.332 --> 15:54.924
You've been a great crowd.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.992
A mind reader, huh?

15:57.035 --> 16:01.028
That seems kind of hocus-pocus,
now, don't it?

16:01.073 --> 16:02.904
It's as crazy as...

16:02.941 --> 16:04.670
oh, let's say the fact...

16:04.710 --> 16:08.077
that nobody can recall
what happened that night...

16:08.113 --> 16:12.743
the night that a policeman
and his motorcycle simply vanished.

16:12.785 --> 16:16.084
Well, maybe I'm just
an ignorant old country lawyer...

16:16.121 --> 16:18.589
but this sounds like a cover-up.

16:18.624 --> 16:21.525
Or is it magic?
Do you believe in magic?

16:21.560 --> 16:26.691
The Monarch must, for he's given us
no other rational explanation.

16:26.732 --> 16:28.927
Something big is going down.

16:28.967 --> 16:31.629
This place is crawling with Strangers.

16:31.670 --> 16:33.103
You can't expect to know everybody.

16:33.138 --> 16:34.264
No, Hank.

16:34.306 --> 16:36.604
Strangers are undercover Guild operatives.

16:36.642 --> 16:37.768
We gotta warn Pop!

16:37.810 --> 16:39.437
No, Dean.
This is Guild business.

16:39.478 --> 16:40.945
Your father isn't in any harm.

16:40.979 --> 16:43.174
The Guild works clean, professional.

16:43.215 --> 16:44.682
It's surgical with them.

16:44.716 --> 16:47.776
In a way, they're the only organization
I still respect.

16:47.820 --> 16:51.347
And they kill clean.
Don't let dames get in the way.

16:51.390 --> 16:54.689
Honestly, Hank, where
do you pick that stuff up?

16:54.726 --> 16:55.886
I never see you read.

16:55.928 --> 16:57.122
It's weird, right?

16:57.162 --> 16:59.096
It's like he channels dead crazy people.

16:59.131 --> 17:00.655
You think it's a cry for help?

17:00.699 --> 17:03.395
So... a mind reader.

17:03.435 --> 17:04.902
Fascinating.

17:04.936 --> 17:09.464
Could you read the mind of, let's say,
for instance, the Monarch?

17:09.508 --> 17:10.906
If it would please the court.

17:10.943 --> 17:12.410
Objection. No way!

17:12.444 --> 17:14.070
This is most unorthodox.

17:14.112 --> 17:15.579
Unorthodox?

17:15.614 --> 17:17.809
The defendant's in a crown,
for God's sake!

17:17.849 --> 17:21.377
I myself am growing from the torso
of an inbred simpleton.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.583
I promise not to make his eyes boil.

17:24.623 --> 17:28.252
I'll... allow it.

17:28.292 --> 17:30.193
Hug me.

17:30.229 --> 17:32.754
Fine. Whatever gets you off, man.

17:32.798 --> 17:34.595
Just don't go for the reach-around...

17:34.633 --> 17:36.157
because the Monarch doesn't swing that...

17:36.201 --> 17:37.759
Sleep!

17:37.803 --> 17:39.828
Dream.

17:46.812 --> 17:49.110
All right, what's going on here?

17:49.147 --> 17:52.776
Oh, just doing some... gardening.

17:52.818 --> 17:56.515
I got a call from a concerned citizen
there's a domestic going on here.

17:56.555 --> 18:01.015
Listen, Officer Poncharello,
my second-in-command just left me.

18:01.059 --> 18:04.153
So why don't you put
your fat Tom-of-Finland ass...

18:04.196 --> 18:06.926
back on your big gay bike
and go home?

18:06.965 --> 18:08.489
This is none of your beeswax.

18:08.533 --> 18:11.058
OK, pal, let's just keep those hands
where I can see them.

18:11.103 --> 18:13.799
Oh, you want some of this?
Let's go, Fonzie.

18:13.839 --> 18:15.830
Come on. Take your best shot!

18:15.874 --> 18:18.434
Think you can take this?
So, too fast for you?

18:23.282 --> 18:25.546
It's all there.
Do you want to count it?

18:25.584 --> 18:26.949
No. That's bad form.

18:26.985 --> 18:29.852
There's a passport,
name change information, the works.

18:29.888 --> 18:31.719
Even got you a new wife.

18:31.757 --> 18:33.952
You won't see her much,
being a supermodel.

18:33.992 --> 18:35.425
She'll be traveling a lot.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.690
Uh, do I have an erection?

18:37.729 --> 18:39.253
I feel like I might have one.

18:39.298 --> 18:41.357
Pleasure doing business
with you, gentlemen.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.925
If we see you, hear your voice in a crowd...

18:43.969 --> 18:46.767
Don't worry about me. I'm a ghost.

18:46.805 --> 18:48.432
Good. We'll take it from here.

18:52.744 --> 18:55.440
You won't believe this.

18:55.480 --> 19:00.076
I've seen the greasy interior
of many a mind...

19:00.118 --> 19:02.678
and I'm not sure I believe this.

19:02.721 --> 19:04.985
Now! It must be now! Now!

19:05.023 --> 19:06.456
- What'd I miss?
- Now!

19:06.491 --> 19:08.288
It's a Freeze-Team!

19:08.327 --> 19:10.124
Down on the ground and hold your breath.

19:10.162 --> 19:11.424
There's pee pee on the floor!

19:11.463 --> 19:12.930
I told you to hold your breath.

19:22.774 --> 19:24.298
Take the prisoner.

19:24.343 --> 19:27.278
For everyone else, I want
a level three memory wipe. Move!

19:32.384 --> 19:37.583
Finally, number three
on the Guild's most wanted list...

19:37.622 --> 19:39.351
Tiny Attorney.

19:39.391 --> 19:44.260
It's time the Guild sentences him
to a "Trial Separation."

19:44.296 --> 19:45.422
Ha! I just made that up.

19:45.464 --> 19:47.125
It's funny on a lot of levels.

19:47.165 --> 19:48.427
Right. It just came out.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.094
What about the necromancer?

19:50.135 --> 19:52.262
Memory wipes don't
work on his kind.

19:52.304 --> 19:55.933
True, but they take to hypnotic suggestion
like cancer to a prostate.

19:55.974 --> 19:57.942
Wait! I know this one.

19:57.976 --> 20:01.002
Filed with us five times
to get an arch-rival...

20:01.046 --> 20:03.105
part of the Venture clique, I think.

20:03.148 --> 20:06.345
You know the Monarch did it.

20:06.385 --> 20:10.185
He's a very bad man who wants
to hurt the Venture family...

20:10.222 --> 20:11.917
and once he's put away...

20:11.957 --> 20:16.360
we'll get all of you a new arch-rival,
just like you've always wanted.

20:16.395 --> 20:18.295
You're gonna put the Monarch away?

20:18.330 --> 20:19.524
You never told me that.

20:19.564 --> 20:21.498
Somebody has to take the fall.

20:21.533 --> 20:25.867
But you, my dear, you were perfect,
a regular Mata Hari.

20:25.904 --> 20:28.873
Trust me.
The Guild will reward you handsomely.

20:28.907 --> 20:31.808
But as for your precious Monarch,
forget him.

20:31.843 --> 20:34.243
He's totally screwed.

20:34.279 --> 20:37.146
Will that hypnotic suggestion thing
work on him?

20:37.182 --> 20:38.581
I think so.

20:38.617 --> 20:41.017
I had nothing to do with this crap.

20:41.053 --> 20:45.251
It was, like, I don't know, those weird kids,
the Venture brothers.

20:45.290 --> 20:46.484
They did it.

20:46.525 --> 20:48.789
Strangers, withdraw!

20:50.529 --> 20:54.465
All clear, Mr. Samson. The Guild
appreciates your non-interference.

20:54.499 --> 20:55.989
Whatever. How much time?

20:56.034 --> 20:57.729
Twenty seconds.

21:00.005 --> 21:02.030
Continue, Mr. Orpheus.
You were saying?

21:02.074 --> 21:03.837
I hope they find me a girl villain.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.308
- Mr. Orpheus?
- A redhead.

21:05.343 --> 21:06.970
He's gonna blow it.

21:07.012 --> 21:09.606
Brock, when did you get back?

21:09.648 --> 21:10.945
What happened to the little guy
riding the retard?

21:10.982 --> 21:12.449
Don't worry about it.

21:12.484 --> 21:14.111
Mr. Orpheus, you were
telling us what you learned.

21:14.152 --> 21:16.052
That is true, I was.

21:16.088 --> 21:21.116
With my own eyes,
I have seen into his senses.

21:21.159 --> 21:24.128
I have been a witness to his doings!

21:24.162 --> 21:29.031
And I have found
that the Monarch is...

21:29.067 --> 21:33.868
without any shadow of a doubt...

21:33.905 --> 21:36.703
guilty!

22:04.636 --> 22:08.094
Oh, my precious pookums,
of course I forgive you.

22:08.140 --> 22:12.577
Why, in a few, oh, I don't know, decades...

22:12.611 --> 22:14.442
I'll be out of here,

22:14.479 --> 22:18.074
And we can... we can just start again.

22:18.116 --> 22:20.277
Can I go now?

22:20.318 --> 22:22.013
Everybody's staring at me.

22:23.121 --> 22:25.282
That's good soup!

22:26.305 --> 22:32.554
