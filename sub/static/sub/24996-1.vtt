[faint water dripping]

02:02.458 --> 02:03.791
[thud]

02:03.793 --> 02:07.330
[grunting]

02:17.506 --> 02:22.245
[heavy breathing]

02:25.381 --> 02:27.250
[groaning]

03:06.388 --> 03:08.458
Morning, sunshine.

03:11.494 --> 03:15.065
Although, we don't exactly
get any of that down here.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.267
Where the hell am I?

03:21.269 --> 03:25.174
Well, right now, I'd say
somewhere between...

03:26.241 --> 03:29.078
Houston and Quintana River.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.315
[man] Who are you?

03:35.317 --> 03:38.485
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

03:38.487 --> 03:42.890
It's been a long time since I saw
him this worked up over an inmate.

03:42.892 --> 03:47.097
Inmate?
No, that doesn't make any...

03:48.396 --> 03:49.698
[groaning]

03:50.698 --> 03:53.803
It'll wear off.
Don't worry.

03:55.503 --> 03:58.540
It's easy at first, I know.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.645
It'll all come back.

04:03.778 --> 04:06.513
How long have I been here?

04:06.515 --> 04:08.514
About a day now.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.752
What about you?

04:13.321 --> 04:14.922
I stopped counting.

04:14.924 --> 04:17.357
I never saw the point
if I'm not going anywhere.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.628
Why? What did you do?

04:20.962 --> 04:22.595
How much time you got?

04:22.597 --> 04:24.167
[chuckles]

04:25.333 --> 04:27.833
What is this place?

04:27.835 --> 04:32.241
It doesn't officially exist.
Which means neither do you.

04:34.376 --> 04:35.943
Black site?

04:35.945 --> 04:38.781
It's more like a burial ground.

04:40.683 --> 04:42.715
Except there ain't no
ground down here.

04:42.717 --> 04:46.155
[rumbling]

04:52.895 --> 04:57.633
You're 30,000 leagues under
the goddamn sea, my friend.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.478
No, no, no, no...

05:12.480 --> 05:14.848
So, whatever you've done it seems
like someone took great lengths

05:14.850 --> 05:17.016
to make sure
you never see the light again.

05:17.018 --> 05:20.020
No, no, no...
No, this can't happen.

05:20.022 --> 05:22.288
I should not be here.

05:22.290 --> 05:27.596
Yeah, but you are so, maybe
you ought to figure out why.

05:28.730 --> 05:31.433
What's the last thing
you remember?

06:29.558 --> 06:31.694
[woman]
Eh, that's far enough.

06:34.362 --> 06:35.964
Set the keys down.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.701
And the gun.

06:44.873 --> 06:47.577
- You're early.
- So are you.

06:52.047 --> 06:53.112
[gun cocks]

06:53.114 --> 06:54.984
Are you going to shoot me?

06:55.984 --> 06:59.752
That depends, did you bring it?

06:59.754 --> 07:01.754
Yeah.

07:01.756 --> 07:02.989
Show me.

07:02.991 --> 07:06.296
Only if you say please.

07:13.902 --> 07:16.372
Standard issue.

07:18.974 --> 07:21.544
If the occasion calls for it.

07:23.712 --> 07:26.812
Whoa, how did you know?

07:26.814 --> 07:29.949
Didn't I tell you?

07:29.951 --> 07:32.621
It's one of my many talents.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.403
Mm... Mm!
Oh, no, no.

07:49.405 --> 07:53.109
- You first.
- You don't trust me?

07:57.078 --> 08:00.882
- Pick up any tails?
- Do you really have to ask?

08:05.186 --> 08:07.554
See?

08:07.556 --> 08:09.122
It's safe.

08:09.124 --> 08:10.926
Your turn.

08:18.801 --> 08:20.570
Are you satisfied?

08:24.672 --> 08:26.075
You tell me.

08:29.811 --> 08:32.815
We still have to
talk some business.

08:34.015 --> 08:35.918
Business can wait.

09:03.744 --> 09:08.113
So, tell me Mr. Wheeler, are all
your partners this lucky?

09:08.115 --> 09:11.653
Lucky? You never tried
the breakfast here.

09:15.957 --> 09:17.623
[woman]
So, what'd Drummond say?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.894
[Wheeler] He's on standby
until we make contact.

09:20.896 --> 09:23.997
Our guy will turn up.
It's just a matter of time.

09:23.999 --> 09:27.867
Unless he doesn't.
And then we lose the buyer.

09:27.869 --> 09:31.670
Buyer won't matter
when we find the leak.

09:31.672 --> 09:35.541
Hey, we're going to
get these guys, okay?

09:35.543 --> 09:40.579
- But if anything goes wrong...
- I know, I know.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.051
You don't have
to worry about me.

09:44.853 --> 09:48.221
I am gonna go investigate
this breakfast

09:48.223 --> 09:50.790
that you speak so highly of.

09:50.792 --> 09:51.891
Bring you something back?

09:51.893 --> 09:54.729
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:23.191 --> 10:24.994
[water running]

11:04.132 --> 11:06.569
[knocking]

11:16.744 --> 11:18.614
[knocking]

11:23.985 --> 11:26.785
Can you come back in an hour?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.021
[gunshots]

11:28.023 --> 11:29.825
[screaming]

12:40.961 --> 12:43.331
[people screaming]

12:50.004 --> 12:52.340
Go back inside, go.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.260
[gunshots]

13:15.263 --> 13:16.929
We'll have to make a run
for the pickup truck.

13:16.931 --> 13:18.897
- I'll cover you.
- Scott, listen...

13:18.899 --> 13:20.935
There's no time to talk, go.

14:06.815 --> 14:08.450
Scott!

14:14.089 --> 14:15.789
Get in, let's go!

14:15.791 --> 14:18.491
Wait, wait, shit.
The drive.

14:18.493 --> 14:20.128
What?

14:22.830 --> 14:25.366
I gotta go back and get it.
Cover me!

14:44.920 --> 14:46.322
Fuck!

14:49.356 --> 14:51.226
[grunts]

14:52.226 --> 14:53.559
Mel!

14:53.561 --> 14:55.130
[groans]

14:56.330 --> 14:59.200
- [grunts]
- [gunshots]

15:27.928 --> 15:29.328
[gunshot]

15:29.330 --> 15:30.800
[yells]

15:38.373 --> 15:40.075
[engine turnover]

15:56.624 --> 15:58.326
Fuck!

16:06.133 --> 16:07.503
Fuck.

16:12.474 --> 16:14.073
[dial tone]

16:14.075 --> 16:15.507
[ringing]

16:15.509 --> 16:19.978
[vibrating]

16:19.980 --> 16:22.048
Go ahead.

16:22.050 --> 16:25.318
- We're blown.
- Is the drive secure?

16:25.320 --> 16:27.654
Negative.
But I've got the dongle.

16:27.656 --> 16:31.323
They won't be able to access
anything without it.

16:31.325 --> 16:35.694
One hundred and fifty miles east of
your location is a town called Milton.

16:35.696 --> 16:38.997
There's a parking garage,
corner of 3rd and Roxy.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.198
Meet me in three hours.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.872
<i>You keep your head down.</i>

17:50.271 --> 17:52.472
On the ground!

17:52.474 --> 17:53.943
Down!

18:00.648 --> 18:02.581
[grunting]

18:02.583 --> 18:04.152
Easy.

18:05.686 --> 18:07.252
[grunts]

18:07.254 --> 18:08.957
[man] There ya are.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.771
[car door shuts]

18:25.773 --> 18:27.743
[sirens blaring]

18:42.357 --> 18:45.293
He's clean, it's not here.

18:56.838 --> 18:59.504
We tracked the pickup to
an alley three blocks from here.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.207
Empty.
Phones no good either.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.709
Must have swapped
the SIM after the call.

19:03.711 --> 19:08.150
Prep him for evac.
Notify them that we're en route.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.751
Where do you think
he stashed it?

19:11.753 --> 19:14.322
That's what
we're gonna find out.

19:22.629 --> 19:27.232
First Ballad and now Tom, looks
like your boy is cleaning up, Ed.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.071
It's not his M.O.

19:31.138 --> 19:33.405
I'd say these bodies
beg to differ.

19:33.407 --> 19:36.142
I think you and I both know
there's more to it than that.

19:36.144 --> 19:38.444
All I know is that right now
he's the only one

19:38.446 --> 19:40.579
who knows the location
of those files.

19:40.581 --> 19:43.348
And we're gonna do whatever
it takes to find them.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.684
I don't doubt that,
Agent Ferris.

19:45.686 --> 19:48.887
But perhaps you might want
to reconsider your strategy.

19:48.889 --> 19:53.225
I know this man very well.
Let me talk with him.

19:53.227 --> 19:56.128
You're here as a courtesy,
nothing more.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.697
Your relationship with Wheeler
becomes relevant

19:58.699 --> 20:00.899
only when I deem it as such.

20:00.901 --> 20:04.636
So let's put the breaks
on this chit chat

20:04.638 --> 20:07.408
and I'll let you know
when you're needed.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.611
As you wish.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.521
- Ferris.
- You Kingsley?

20:55.523 --> 20:59.258
That's right. Your boys tell me
this reservation is top priority.

20:59.260 --> 21:02.627
He's a former asset, so Langley
needs this contained.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.298
Discretion is of
the upmost importance here.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.433
[Kingsley]
Has he been prepped?

21:07.435 --> 21:09.501
Sleep agent has been
administered.

21:09.503 --> 21:11.203
We got about 12 hours.

21:11.205 --> 21:13.772
And how long do you intend
to stay on my clock?

21:13.774 --> 21:15.744
Until we get what we need.

21:17.212 --> 21:19.979
You think those other men
are necessary?

21:19.981 --> 21:22.848
Why? Is there a problem?

21:22.850 --> 21:27.485
No. But if there was, my men
could sure as hell handle it.

21:27.487 --> 21:31.490
Yeah, but they're watchdogs.
Lackeys at best.

21:31.492 --> 21:35.261
So, forgive us if we don't
share your confidence.

21:35.263 --> 21:38.630
This is Edward Rhodes
from Intelligence.

21:38.632 --> 21:41.666
He's here just to oversee
the interrogation.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.636
Look, it's quite simple.

21:44.638 --> 21:47.809
You stay out of our way
and we'll stay out of yours.

21:50.011 --> 21:53.248
Alright, let's do this.

22:07.294 --> 22:09.895
Correct me if I'm wrong, this
was repurposed for the navy?

22:09.897 --> 22:11.496
That's right.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.964
After it was retired
from the fleet,

22:12.966 --> 22:15.001
the government elected
not to scrap it.

22:15.003 --> 22:16.735
We figured it be better
to retrofit it

22:16.737 --> 22:19.437
and house all the Bin Laden's
around the world.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.307
Former squid paid to steer.

22:21.309 --> 22:23.442
They stick to their side,
we stick to ours,

22:23.444 --> 22:26.011
everybody minds
their own business.

22:26.013 --> 22:30.015
I've heard rumors about this thing.
I didn't think it actually existed.

22:30.017 --> 22:35.588
It doesn't. As far as
the CIA is concerned...

22:35.590 --> 22:37.359
we were never here.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.799
I wasn't aware
of another pickup.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.702
Last minute reservation
just came down

22:49.704 --> 22:51.771
from Military Intelligence.

22:51.773 --> 22:55.840
Just another John Doe,
nothing to worry about.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.310
With all that nonsense
surrounding GTMO,

22:58.312 --> 23:01.847
it's about time
the company men went mobile.

23:01.849 --> 23:07.353
Like I always said, it ain't really
a black site if you can find it.

23:07.355 --> 23:09.521
- You got enough men?
- Payloads a little light.

23:09.523 --> 23:12.793
No need to overhaul.
But let me show you something.

23:16.330 --> 23:19.065
Everything is controlled
electronically from this room.

23:19.067 --> 23:20.969
Even the cells.

23:23.370 --> 23:27.572
- [Ferris] Is that his room?
- Yes, it is.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.343
I want to see it.

23:34.514 --> 23:37.817
Look, they all start off tough,
say they could take it,

23:37.819 --> 23:41.753
but sooner or later,
they all crack.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.557
Ain't that right, Marco?

23:44.559 --> 23:45.991
[chuckles]

23:45.993 --> 23:47.960
[Kingsley] He withstood
it all once upon a time.

23:47.962 --> 23:52.334
Water torture, sleep deprivation,
even erectile feeding.

23:57.905 --> 24:00.505
Halls reinforced with steel.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.843
Toilets,
they don't lead anywhere.

24:07.482 --> 24:12.518
Look, I appreciate you trying to get a lay
of the land, but this ain't my first rodeo.

24:12.520 --> 24:17.389
The man staying in this cell is a highly
decorated officer and a trained killer.

24:17.391 --> 24:20.592
He's been taught to adapt,
improvise.

24:20.594 --> 24:23.896
He so much as gets a hold
of a strand of floss,

24:23.898 --> 24:26.732
you'd best believe
he'd find his way out of here.

24:26.734 --> 24:29.601
[Kingsley] Believe me, Agent Ferris,
there's no way he's getting out of here.

24:29.603 --> 24:32.104
Nobody ever has,
and nobody ever will.

24:32.106 --> 24:33.806
[Ferris] I'm just concerned
that he doesn't take

24:33.808 --> 24:36.942
a whole bunch of us
with him when he goes.

24:36.944 --> 24:38.743
[woman]
This stuff takes time.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.446
Yeah, babe, I know,
but this might be

24:41.448 --> 24:43.718
the last chance that I get
to call for a while so...

24:47.021 --> 24:49.088
Oh, shit, look I gotta go.

24:49.090 --> 24:51.626
I'll call you
as soon as I can, okay?

24:52.827 --> 24:55.528
Alright, love you, too, bye.

24:55.530 --> 24:57.596
- Hey.
- How's your dad?

24:57.598 --> 24:59.498
He's alright.
What's going on?

24:59.500 --> 25:01.867
- Right now, suits are here.
- What? Already?

25:01.869 --> 25:04.669
- Yeah.
- Shit.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.571
Oh, God, who they bringing?

25:06.573 --> 25:08.174
- They didn't say.
- Fuck.

25:08.176 --> 25:09.974
Whoever it is, it's someone
important though.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.177
Never seen Langley bring
so many men before.

25:12.179 --> 25:13.447
Huh.

25:14.648 --> 25:16.014
Ferris is running point.

25:16.016 --> 25:19.918
Shit.
Fuck, why didn't you tell me?

25:19.920 --> 25:21.886
Cass, relax.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.688
Look, he probably hasn't had
a chance to look at it yet.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.524
- You know, just busy...
- Yeah, right, it's been weeks.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.396
Of course he has.

25:29.964 --> 25:32.063
Okay, how do I look?

25:32.065 --> 25:36.534
- Desperate.
- Ha, very funny.

25:36.536 --> 25:41.674
- Okay. Come on.
- Let's go, come on.

25:41.676 --> 25:43.908
Let me know when we hit
international waters.

25:43.910 --> 25:47.879
In the meantime, I'd like to put one
of my guys in there til he wakes up.

25:47.881 --> 25:51.951
Just an extra set of eyes. Don't
worry, she's still your ship.

25:51.953 --> 25:56.055
- Where does this go?
- Bow access door, crew side.

25:56.057 --> 25:57.923
Only two keys can unlock it.

25:57.925 --> 25:59.625
[Ferris]
It doesn't look they visit much.

25:59.627 --> 26:02.962
Security measures.
Speaking of security measures...

26:02.964 --> 26:05.865
Here come your two.

26:05.867 --> 26:07.199
You're company?

26:07.201 --> 26:09.501
That's right,
I'm Ryan, this is Taylor.

26:09.503 --> 26:12.003
Ferris. How we looking below?

26:12.005 --> 26:14.807
Interrogation room is already
prepped and set.

26:14.809 --> 26:17.041
Good.
Mind if we go take a look?

26:17.043 --> 26:19.110
Actually, sir,
we haven't been briefed yet.

26:19.112 --> 26:23.816
And you won't be. All you need to
know is he's a high value target.

26:23.818 --> 26:26.618
Of course, but,
typically protocol...

26:26.620 --> 26:31.690
SOP went out the window the second this
man compromised national security.

26:31.692 --> 26:33.826
All I need from you two
is your cooperation

26:33.828 --> 26:37.195
and assistance
if and when it's needed.

26:37.197 --> 26:39.732
Sound good?

26:39.734 --> 26:41.735
- Yes, sir.
- Good, let's go.

26:44.772 --> 26:47.873
I just wanted to say I'm looking
forward to working together, sir.

26:47.875 --> 26:51.976
I've actually put in a request
with your unit for field ops.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.146
Looking to make the jump.

26:54.148 --> 26:55.548
Taylor.

26:55.550 --> 26:57.853
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, that's right, yeah.

26:59.186 --> 27:01.822
Well, I'm sure someone
will get back to you.

27:12.132 --> 27:13.734
Hm.

27:45.032 --> 27:48.270
This is the captain, I've got
the con, prepare to dive.

27:49.803 --> 27:52.673
[creaking]

28:02.350 --> 28:03.682
[thud]

28:03.684 --> 28:04.886
[coughing]

28:11.058 --> 28:13.228
Wakey, wakey.

28:15.329 --> 28:17.132
Subject's awake.

28:34.247 --> 28:35.883
You got a name?

28:37.851 --> 28:39.119
Marco.

28:40.420 --> 28:45.057
Okay.
Okay, I'm Scott.

28:45.059 --> 28:47.393
- How can I get out of here?
- You don't.

28:47.395 --> 28:51.600
Well, unless you're
a fan of body bags.

28:54.267 --> 28:56.868
[door creaks open]

28:56.870 --> 28:58.205
Oh.

29:02.676 --> 29:06.145
I see you're about to meet
Weddle and Dax.

29:06.147 --> 29:09.748
Stand back and turn around.
Step back, hands on the wall.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.716
I want to speak to
someone in charge.

29:11.718 --> 29:13.787
Hands on the wall, now!

29:18.192 --> 29:20.195
[beeping]

29:22.295 --> 29:24.262
Look, who is someone in...

29:24.264 --> 29:25.667
[grunts]

29:29.270 --> 29:31.840
[Marco] Hey, Dax.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.940
Come on, Dax.

29:34.942 --> 29:38.210
Take it easy,
it's his first day.

29:38.212 --> 29:40.713
You wanna piece of this,
too, Marco?!

29:40.715 --> 29:45.020
Yeah, well, it's been a while
since I felt a woman's touch.

29:47.154 --> 29:50.058
Show me your pecs, baby.
[laughs]

29:58.264 --> 29:59.934
We're on the move.

30:03.404 --> 30:06.504
Agent Ferris, please, let me
explain something to you.

30:06.506 --> 30:10.244
Scott Wheeler was hand-picked
into my division for a reason.

30:12.213 --> 30:17.449
<i>Guys like him, they have an
infinite threshold for pain.</i>

30:17.451 --> 30:20.219
<i>And they're not just
trained for it.</i>

30:20.221 --> 30:22.354
<i>They're born with it.</i>

30:22.356 --> 30:24.792
That man was built to numb.

30:26.127 --> 30:29.861
<i>Now a little torture
isn't gonna go anywhere.</i>

30:29.863 --> 30:35.032
You know, I've been trying
to figure your angle here, Ed.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.336
You pulled a lot of strings
to get on board

30:37.338 --> 30:41.874
and somehow I just don't think
it's to tell me how to run my op.

30:41.876 --> 30:45.010
I just don't wanna see a good
man get rolled up. That's all.

30:45.012 --> 30:46.278
Then he shouldn't
have changed sides.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.280
Allegedly changed sides.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.318
[beeping]

30:51.785 --> 30:53.452
They're here.

30:53.454 --> 30:55.220
Kill the feed.

30:55.222 --> 30:58.259
- Rankin, kill it.
- Copy that.

31:07.267 --> 31:08.934
You wanna learn a thing or two?

31:08.936 --> 31:12.570
Go inside there
and pay close attention.

31:12.572 --> 31:14.109
Yes, sir.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.247
[panting]

32:13.466 --> 32:17.435
My name is Patrick Ferris,
I'm a chief officer with SAD.

32:17.437 --> 32:21.639
I'd like to start by making you aware
that you're an enemy combatant.

32:21.641 --> 32:27.145
And therefore have not and will
not be granted any rights.

32:27.147 --> 32:30.449
You know how this works
so I'll keep it simple.

32:30.451 --> 32:35.887
I want the location of the drive along
with the names of those complicit

32:35.889 --> 32:38.190
with your efforts to sell it.

32:38.192 --> 32:42.927
Now, if you give me
everything you know,

32:42.929 --> 32:45.432
then maybe we can talk a deal.

32:48.435 --> 32:51.470
You got any ID on you?

32:51.472 --> 32:54.341
- Excuse me?
- Do you have any ID?

33:04.984 --> 33:06.119
There you go.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.332
I don't have it.

33:21.334 --> 33:23.001
Oh, come on.

33:23.003 --> 33:25.236
We know your guys took it
from Agent Ballard.

33:25.238 --> 33:28.339
- Who's your buyer?
- We never met him.

33:28.341 --> 33:32.179
Drummond was hoping
that we can draw out the leak.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.013
How much did they offer you?

33:36.015 --> 33:39.350
You're not listening. Ballard
and I were assigned deep cover.

33:39.352 --> 33:44.892
I was on my way to meet Drummond,
but someone got him first.

33:46.126 --> 33:50.161
And maybe that someone was you.

33:50.163 --> 33:54.199
"Agent Wheeler has begun to show
ambivalence towards his objective.

33:54.201 --> 33:58.306
He has failed to check-in
on three occasions now.

34:01.208 --> 34:06.411
I have suspicions that he is
already in contact with his buyer.

34:06.413 --> 34:10.685
and have asked Agent Ballard
to investigate further."

34:14.355 --> 34:18.123
Is that why you staged
an ambush and killed her?

34:18.125 --> 34:20.125
She was on to you, wasn't she?

34:20.127 --> 34:24.295
- Someone is setting me up.
- Right.

34:24.297 --> 34:26.297
And you just happen to be
in possession

34:26.299 --> 34:30.168
of the only other device that can
access what's on that drive.

34:30.170 --> 34:32.270
Convenient don't you think?

34:32.272 --> 34:34.172
Who tipped you off?

34:34.174 --> 34:36.641
Drummond was the only one
who knew.

34:36.643 --> 34:40.148
How do you know it wasn't
Drummond himself?

34:42.348 --> 34:46.717
I know you're a smart guy,
but you need to drop the act.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.221
I want the location
and the names.

34:49.223 --> 34:51.558
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

35:01.668 --> 35:05.536
Do you know that there's a spot
just below the retina

35:05.538 --> 35:11.043
where the sensory nerves can channel
receptors directly to the brain?

35:11.045 --> 35:14.045
See, we've been doing it
wrong all these years.

35:14.047 --> 35:16.815
Going in through a vein
in the arm.

35:16.817 --> 35:20.451
Forget sodium pentothal.

35:20.453 --> 35:23.521
You want me
to tell you the truth?

35:23.523 --> 35:25.493
You put a needle in his eye.

35:26.627 --> 35:29.130
[sighs]
This won't go anywhere.

35:33.567 --> 35:35.636
Who's your buyer?

35:37.770 --> 35:39.706
Who's your buyer, Scott?

35:41.241 --> 35:43.442
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

35:43.444 --> 35:48.246
- Then stop asking.
- Welcome to hell.

35:48.248 --> 35:51.386
Just do it.
You're wasting my time.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.796
Godamnit. Ed!

36:04.297 --> 36:05.632
<i>Get in here!</i>

36:13.739 --> 36:16.810
You're starting to look
a little pale there, darling.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.880
- [beeping]
- [door opens]

36:21.882 --> 36:23.418
[sighs]

36:31.657 --> 36:33.724
That's not exactly
how you get promoted, Cass.

36:33.726 --> 36:35.393
I mean you're lucky Ferris
didn't see that.

36:35.395 --> 36:37.297
I know, I just need some air.

36:38.632 --> 36:40.431
I know that guy.

36:40.433 --> 36:43.235
They brought him to the farm
when I was a recruit.

36:43.237 --> 36:44.802
He's a legend.

36:44.804 --> 36:46.170
So what?

36:46.172 --> 36:48.308
So nothing.
Now he's a traitor?

36:49.275 --> 36:51.242
That's the game, Cass.

36:51.244 --> 36:53.244
Look, you can't
let it twist you.

36:53.246 --> 36:56.148
Alright, and if it does,
you can't let him see it.

36:56.150 --> 36:59.217
I know, I know.
[exhales]

36:59.219 --> 37:02.554
Look, it's my first time
in there, too.

37:02.556 --> 37:03.824
Okay?

37:04.824 --> 37:07.259
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

37:07.261 --> 37:10.431
- I just need to sit.
- Okay.

37:14.902 --> 37:18.371
Make him talk or my boys
start laying down plastic.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.210
Rhodes.

37:24.444 --> 37:26.514
What are you doing here?

37:33.353 --> 37:35.487
We don't have a lot of time.

37:35.489 --> 37:36.922
These guys don't trust you,

37:36.924 --> 37:39.858
they don't trust me,
they don't trust anybody.

37:39.860 --> 37:42.494
This guy Ferris,
he was trained to chase facts.

37:42.496 --> 37:44.628
He's worse than a Doberman.

37:44.630 --> 37:48.235
So you're gonna have to earn
some good faith right now.

37:49.469 --> 37:50.871
What's the first thing
I taught you?

37:52.739 --> 37:53.938
Don't get caught.

37:53.940 --> 37:57.308
Yeah, right, but if you do,

37:57.310 --> 37:59.911
you have to create the leverage
to keep you alive

37:59.913 --> 38:04.849
long enough to make a move.
Right?

38:04.851 --> 38:07.622
So do you have this dongle?

38:13.293 --> 38:14.462
Where?

38:17.230 --> 38:19.496
It's safe.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.800
Scott, I can't help you
unless you give me something.

38:22.802 --> 38:26.404
If I hand it over,
I will have nothing.

38:26.406 --> 38:28.005
Let me worry about that, okay?

38:28.007 --> 38:30.308
You just have to buy
enough time where I can

38:30.310 --> 38:32.547
get you the heck out of here.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.748
- I'll take your guys to it.
- You know that'll never fly.

38:37.750 --> 38:40.418
We're on a submarine.

38:40.420 --> 38:42.723
Look, just give me a location.

38:46.726 --> 38:49.293
Scott, this is your only move.

38:49.295 --> 38:51.295
And they're gonna
put the hounds on you

38:51.297 --> 38:54.331
until you die or until
you make something up.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.034
Whichever comes first.
This is it.

38:57.036 --> 38:59.270
Hey, Ed, clocks ticking.

38:59.272 --> 39:00.540
Okay.

39:01.942 --> 39:03.811
They're assholes.

39:04.944 --> 39:08.947
Fine, only you.
Nobody else.

39:08.949 --> 39:11.418
I can live with that.

39:13.487 --> 39:16.721
Great, you did the right thing.
Now you hang in there.

39:16.723 --> 39:19.259
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

39:20.793 --> 39:22.059
Where's the drive?

39:22.061 --> 39:24.061
Well, he doesn't know,
but he said he'll

39:24.063 --> 39:27.431
take us to the location
of the second component.

39:27.433 --> 39:30.067
Second component?
What are you doing?

39:30.069 --> 39:33.975
- That's not the objective.
- Well, it is now.

39:39.346 --> 39:40.982
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup...

39:48.955 --> 39:52.489
Mr. Kingsley, you and your men
have 30 seconds

39:52.491 --> 39:55.592
to make
a very important decision.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.029
I can make you all
extremely wealthy,

39:58.031 --> 39:59.998
I'll need your assistance,
immediately.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.802
You now have 20 seconds.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.907
You don't look surprised, Scott.

40:10.944 --> 40:13.110
Let me guess,

40:13.112 --> 40:16.350
the location thing
was bullshit, huh?

40:17.750 --> 40:20.018
When did you know?

40:20.020 --> 40:22.922
When you went after the only
thing Ferris didn't need.

40:24.558 --> 40:25.960
Good catch.

40:28.862 --> 40:31.962
You know, I was never one
for all this needle nonsense,

40:31.964 --> 40:35.702
I've always preferred
the direct approach, okay, so...

40:42.576 --> 40:44.679
Kingsley, times up.

40:52.585 --> 40:53.751
We have an agreement.

40:53.753 --> 40:55.753
Very good. I'll wire the money

40:55.755 --> 40:57.521
as soon as we get topside.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.661
We'll negotiate an exact amount
in a few moments.

41:06.165 --> 41:07.734
Where is it?

41:16.409 --> 41:18.442
Where is it, Scott?

41:18.444 --> 41:21.047
Let me check my bucket,
do you mind?

41:24.583 --> 41:26.553
[Rhodes] Tell me where it is.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.392
The missions over.

41:34.127 --> 41:37.764
Your team's dead.
I don't wanna kill you.

41:39.933 --> 41:42.636
[grunts]
You fucker.

41:44.036 --> 41:45.904
Just tell me where it is.

41:45.906 --> 41:47.672
What's gonna happen to you

41:47.674 --> 41:50.110
when your buyers find out
you fucked up, huh?

41:52.145 --> 41:54.849
You really wanna die over this?

41:56.949 --> 41:58.451
Do you?

42:01.221 --> 42:02.920
This isn't working.

42:02.922 --> 42:06.627
Cut an inch off,
we'll leave him half.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.132
You ready for round two?

42:15.134 --> 42:16.803
God, I hope so.

42:22.074 --> 42:23.576
[yells]

42:59.578 --> 43:00.680
Drop it!

43:08.255 --> 43:09.824
[yells]

43:17.230 --> 43:18.833
I'm not the enemy here.

43:19.933 --> 43:23.134
Interlock your hands
behind your head.

43:23.136 --> 43:25.703
- Come on.
- Are you sure you want to do this?

43:25.705 --> 43:26.773
Now!

43:28.275 --> 43:29.577
Walk to me.

43:32.112 --> 43:33.247
Let's go!

43:36.181 --> 43:38.016
Come on.

43:38.018 --> 43:39.717
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:39.719 --> 43:41.121
[Rhodes] Taylor.

43:42.721 --> 43:46.724
It's Rhodes,
do you have sights on Wheeler?

43:46.726 --> 43:49.059
Where's Ferris?

43:49.061 --> 43:51.628
Ferris is dead.

43:51.630 --> 43:56.067
He went rogue, he and his men
came here to assassinate Wheeler.

43:56.069 --> 43:58.936
We were sent to keep him alive.

43:58.938 --> 44:01.239
Do not listen to...

44:01.241 --> 44:03.241
Do not listen to him.

44:03.243 --> 44:05.279
Are you with Wheeler?

44:08.748 --> 44:12.119
Ryan, are you with Wheeler?

44:13.686 --> 44:15.054
Yes.

44:18.592 --> 44:21.224
Well played, good move.

44:21.226 --> 44:25.096
You need to turn him
over to us right now.

44:25.098 --> 44:26.864
Who the hell are you?

44:26.866 --> 44:29.933
I am your superior
and I'm giving you a command

44:29.935 --> 44:32.637
right now to hand Wheeler over.

44:32.639 --> 44:34.105
You stay you die.

44:34.107 --> 44:35.773
[Rhodes] I'm also the man
that can give you

44:35.775 --> 44:37.641
the assignment you want
or you could be

44:37.643 --> 44:40.744
answering phones for the rest
of your life in Somalia!

44:40.746 --> 44:43.116
Now turn him over, now!

44:45.150 --> 44:51.759
Taylor, I'm coming out unarmed
and we will discuss this.

44:52.759 --> 44:55.329
You have nothing to worry about.

44:57.130 --> 44:59.764
If you get a shot,
kill them both.

44:59.766 --> 45:03.701
- Keep Wheeler alive, you copy?
- Done.

45:03.703 --> 45:05.936
I'm coming out.

45:05.938 --> 45:07.574
I'm unarmed.

45:12.078 --> 45:15.380
Shit. They're gone,
they're gone, get out here.

45:15.382 --> 45:20.817
They're gone. Lock down this boat,
we have to find them right away.

45:20.819 --> 45:23.387
This is Kingsley.
We've got an escaped subject

45:23.389 --> 45:25.223
moving through
the stern of the ship.

45:25.225 --> 45:27.261
He is with Agent Ryan
and Taylor.

45:31.764 --> 45:35.333
<i>If you see them,
employ non-lethal force only.</i>

45:35.335 --> 45:38.639
- <i>This is not a drill.</i>
- You heard 'em, switch the mags.

45:50.449 --> 45:52.319
Son of a bitch.

45:54.821 --> 45:55.989
[Kingsley] <i>Rankin!</i>

45:57.089 --> 45:58.355
<i>Rankin, I need eyes!</i>

45:58.357 --> 46:00.123
I need eyes on the monitor.

46:00.125 --> 46:03.129
- If you see them let me know.
- Yeah, copy that.

46:05.197 --> 46:08.167
We need to talk business
and we need to talk right now.

46:21.915 --> 46:23.350
Go to the right,
go to the right.

46:25.384 --> 46:26.853
Go, go through.

46:31.223 --> 46:32.725
We're clear.

46:39.898 --> 46:41.965
You did good out there.

46:41.967 --> 46:44.134
- You alright?
- Yeah.

46:44.136 --> 46:47.838
You know, I need you to tell me what
the fuck is going on right now.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.340
Cass, come on,
let's turn him in, alright.

46:49.342 --> 46:52.275
- This has nothing to do with us.
- It does now.

46:52.277 --> 46:56.079
Look, I know you don't trust me.

46:56.081 --> 46:59.886
Either we do this together
or I do it alone.

47:04.891 --> 47:05.926
Hey.

47:07.025 --> 47:08.728
Fuck.

47:10.295 --> 47:11.931
I'm trying to be nice here.

47:14.433 --> 47:17.970
Rhodes needs me.
He doesn't need you.

47:20.105 --> 47:21.308
Step back.

47:24.344 --> 47:28.849
Now you're gonna tell me
where I can find a com system.

47:31.351 --> 47:33.951
Control room by the bow.

47:33.953 --> 47:35.520
How many guards?

47:35.522 --> 47:38.192
Two, maybe three.

47:40.860 --> 47:42.262
Any weapons here?

47:45.531 --> 47:47.234
Are you sure?

47:48.534 --> 47:50.270
Come on, step back.

48:14.293 --> 48:16.126
Your turn.

48:16.128 --> 48:18.364
Drop the guns, please.

48:23.136 --> 48:25.136
Yo, let me make one thing clear,
okay?

48:25.138 --> 48:27.204
You're still in our custody.

48:27.206 --> 48:30.141
You do anything to fuck this up
or jeopardize this,

48:30.143 --> 48:33.246
one wrong move I swear to God
I'll fucking kill you.

48:35.614 --> 48:37.450
Okay.

48:48.493 --> 48:51.195
My men are doing a sweep.

48:51.197 --> 48:55.465
- And guess what, we'll find them.
- Good, good.

48:55.467 --> 48:57.500
Hypothetically,

48:57.502 --> 49:00.404
okay, if Wheeler needed
to contact someone topside,

49:00.406 --> 49:02.607
what exactly
would he have to do?

49:02.609 --> 49:05.208
He would have to
get to the control room.

49:05.210 --> 49:07.945
And if he did,
it wouldn't even help him.

49:07.947 --> 49:13.650
- Why?
- At this depth, he's gotta surface or float the buoy.

49:13.652 --> 49:16.587
But he can't do that
without the com.

49:16.589 --> 49:18.389
You think Wheeler knows that?

49:18.391 --> 49:22.896
No, he wouldn't.
But Ryan and Taylor, they would.

49:25.431 --> 49:28.435
Alright, look, get a few men
and come with me.

49:35.909 --> 49:39.509
- [Wheeler] So this was the only post they had, huh?
- What?

49:39.511 --> 49:44.315
I'm guessing the agency promised you
field agent after what, six months?

49:44.317 --> 49:47.451
Come on, it's been
longer than that. Right?

49:47.453 --> 49:49.152
[sighs] Yeah, if it's
all the same to you

49:49.154 --> 49:52.155
I think we can do without
the small talk, okay?

49:52.157 --> 49:54.958
I just want to make sure
you know how to use that thing.

49:54.960 --> 49:58.929
Believe me, you'll be
the first to know. Come on.

49:58.931 --> 50:00.266
Let's go.

50:15.681 --> 50:17.216
Wait.

50:19.284 --> 50:20.654
Slowly.

50:24.324 --> 50:27.724
- Looks like nobody's home.
- Rankin never leaves.

50:27.726 --> 50:30.427
No, Kingsley could of pulled
them, aid with the search.

50:30.429 --> 50:33.396
[Cass] No, control room's
always occupied.

50:33.398 --> 50:37.534
- Okay, listen, I'm going in.
- No, I'll go.

50:37.536 --> 50:40.070
- Watch him.
- [Ryan] Cass.

50:40.072 --> 50:43.310
I got it.
Just have my back.

50:54.087 --> 50:57.456
Taylor's alone.
No sign of subject.

50:59.192 --> 51:01.558
[Kingsley, on walkie] <i>Men,
listen up, he'll be close by.</i>

51:01.560 --> 51:03.296
<i>Just wait.</i>

51:30.589 --> 51:33.424
Tell them if they get the shot,
take her.

51:33.426 --> 51:36.295
If you see her,
take the goddamn shot.

51:55.047 --> 51:57.650
- Got another one.
- Is it Wheeler?

51:58.618 --> 52:01.020
Can't tell from this position.

52:07.460 --> 52:09.529
Tell her to come back.

52:10.730 --> 52:14.634
Cass. Come back.

52:16.768 --> 52:18.205
Come on.

52:19.672 --> 52:21.108
It's Ryan.

52:22.442 --> 52:23.474
Take them both.

52:23.476 --> 52:25.445
<i>Just take them both.</i>

52:36.255 --> 52:38.090
- Down!
- [groans]

52:45.230 --> 52:47.033
[gunfire echoes]

52:59.177 --> 53:01.748
Squeeze it, hold it. Hold it.

53:07.219 --> 53:09.820
Don't talk, don't talk.

53:09.822 --> 53:13.627
Cass... Get out of there, now!

53:17.897 --> 53:19.599
I'm sorry.

53:24.670 --> 53:26.239
[grunts]

53:40.619 --> 53:43.422
[gurgling]

53:59.772 --> 54:01.438
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- We gotta get Ellis.

54:01.440 --> 54:02.505
It's too late!

54:02.507 --> 54:04.210
We gotta get him!

54:12.918 --> 54:14.420
Clear!

54:15.420 --> 54:16.623
Clear.

54:25.397 --> 54:28.199
Jesus.

54:28.201 --> 54:30.534
Don't worry, there's not
many places they could go.

54:30.536 --> 54:34.441
Oh, really?
What about that access door?

54:36.576 --> 54:38.842
Without this, unlikely.

54:38.844 --> 54:41.612
It was also unlikely they were
gonna shoot up there sub.

54:41.614 --> 54:44.882
Sir...
We have a live one.

54:44.884 --> 54:46.920
Oh, Jesus.

54:55.627 --> 54:56.929
[sighs]

55:01.766 --> 55:05.237
Sorry, kid, it's just business.

55:07.306 --> 55:08.909
[gunshot]

55:14.580 --> 55:15.949
Fuck.

55:16.982 --> 55:18.484
Here.

55:23.589 --> 55:25.822
You let him fucking die!

55:25.824 --> 55:29.293
- Hey, he was dead already.
- Bullshit!

55:29.295 --> 55:31.027
He could've lived
and you know it!

55:31.029 --> 55:34.864
I made a judgment call,
you had a chance, he didn't.

55:34.866 --> 55:38.501
- He was dying.
- No, you just wanted to fucking even the odds!

55:38.503 --> 55:43.907
Listen, I know he's your friend,
I'm sorry.

55:43.909 --> 55:45.845
That's the job.

55:48.014 --> 55:49.482
Now...

55:51.417 --> 55:56.654
Is there any way to radio out?

55:56.656 --> 56:01.358
Yeah, we have to make it to
the com, but it's sealed off.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.893
Kingsley's the only one
with the key.

56:02.895 --> 56:04.927
Unless we get the ship
to surface,

56:04.929 --> 56:09.733
the only way we're getting any signal
is by releasing the com's buoy.

56:09.735 --> 56:12.335
So lead me to the bow.

56:12.337 --> 56:16.306
Did you not hear me? Without
Kingsley, it's impossible.

56:16.308 --> 56:19.742
There has to be an actual crew
on the other side, right?

56:19.744 --> 56:23.646
- Yeah.
- Okay, then, if we cannot get to them,

56:23.648 --> 56:25.849
we make them come to us.

56:25.851 --> 56:29.619
And how exactly do you
plan on doing that?

56:29.621 --> 56:32.926
- This is a really bad idea.
- Do you have a better one?

56:34.759 --> 56:36.830
[chatting indistinct]

56:55.081 --> 56:57.751
Auxiliary and lower
engine rooms are clear.

57:00.652 --> 57:02.554
[grunting]

57:31.150 --> 57:34.851
Whoa, whoa, wait, you're not
seriously considering this, are you?

57:34.853 --> 57:39.889
These valves control all the
ventilation for those tanks.

57:39.891 --> 57:43.927
We just need a trigger. Something
that will force their hand.

57:43.929 --> 57:49.699
As long as we reach the valve before the
repair crew, we have a shot, that's it.

57:49.701 --> 57:53.770
- Okay, great, and then what?
- Then, well, you be the hero.

57:53.772 --> 57:56.072
- Well, I'm still taking you in.
- Whatever.

57:56.074 --> 57:59.909
How much time to get
from here to that door?

57:59.911 --> 58:03.980
Three, four minutes tops.
But it's less for them.

58:03.982 --> 58:06.118
Come here,
I think I have an idea.

58:08.953 --> 58:11.954
So, the safety tanks
are meant to be full,

58:11.956 --> 58:13.956
but if we overclock
the negative tank,

58:13.958 --> 58:17.860
I think we can create enough
pressure to just cause a leak.

58:17.862 --> 58:21.967
In the old days,
it was just red wire, blue wire.

58:24.036 --> 58:25.938
Come on, help me.

58:30.643 --> 58:32.445
[sonar pings]

58:33.212 --> 58:34.848
What the...

58:36.781 --> 58:38.917
- It's time to go.
- Yeah, let's go.

58:40.752 --> 58:43.619
[man] <i>Com, com, this
is engine control.</i>

58:43.621 --> 58:45.792
We have a problem here.

58:47.460 --> 58:49.061
Engine room, repeat.

58:53.965 --> 58:55.134
Let's go.

59:05.210 --> 59:09.679
The negative tank
is spiking, captain.

59:09.681 --> 59:11.782
A computer glitch?

59:11.784 --> 59:13.586
It doesn't look like it, sir.

59:16.621 --> 59:18.521
Sommer, this is the captain,
I need a...

59:18.523 --> 59:20.657
Sir, the tank's water pressure
is mounting fast.

59:20.659 --> 59:22.525
Can you close the vent valve?

59:22.527 --> 59:25.027
Negative, someone's bypassed
the emergency line.

59:25.029 --> 59:28.600
- What?
- <i>We'll have to do it manually.</i>

59:34.706 --> 59:36.072
Kingsley, you there?

59:36.074 --> 59:39.675
<i>Kingsley? Kingsley?</i>

59:39.677 --> 59:41.911
What do you think
you're doing, captain?

59:41.913 --> 59:43.880
<i>You're breaking protocol.</i>

59:43.882 --> 59:46.083
Your men have
strict orders to stay away

59:46.085 --> 59:47.717
from all the vessel equipment.

59:47.719 --> 59:49.688
<i>What the hell
is going on back there?</i>

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:06.538
One of your men disengaged an
emergency line on the ballast tank.

01:00:07.706 --> 01:00:09.639
Well, then fix it, damn it.

01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:13.879
It's a goddamn water leak.
I'm sending someone over.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.587
We have a problem!

01:00:21.587 --> 01:00:23.723
[alarm blaring]

01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:27.894
Well, that can't be good.

01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:31.264
Come on!

01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:34.297
Control,
this is the engine room!

We have pump failure
on negative tank!

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:42.072
Get a damage team
down there, now.

01:00:42.074 --> 01:00:45.976
Kingsley, your compartment is
flooding and it's filling up fast.

01:00:45.978 --> 01:00:49.746
<i>I'm sending men over. Whatever
they tell you to do, you do it.</i>

01:00:49.748 --> 01:00:52.051
- Fuck.
- Copy.

[alarm continues]

01:01:21.279 --> 01:01:26.084
Crew's on its way. Redirect all
units to the bow access door.

You're lucky,
it could've been a live round.

Hey, come on, let's go!

01:03:33.511 --> 01:03:35.145
Move, move!

01:03:35.147 --> 01:03:37.382
- Get that door closed!
- Sir.

01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:58.869
Engine control, this is chief of the
boat, requesting damage report.

01:03:58.871 --> 01:04:01.036
Where's the tank?

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:03.239
We got at least a foot of water!

01:04:03.241 --> 01:04:06.777
- Can you contain it?
- Sir, I think so!

01:04:06.779 --> 01:04:09.282
Don't think, officer,
just do it.

01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:12.415
Check those valves!

01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:14.087
Start the drain pump!

01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:22.826
Once this is under control,
take us to periscope depth.

01:04:22.828 --> 01:04:28.864
Take an extra guy, get down to the tank
bay, and keep your eye on those squids.

01:04:28.866 --> 01:04:30.132
Where's my guy?

01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:32.268
You alright?

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:34.503
Kingsley, you have to start
listening to me, alright?

01:04:34.505 --> 01:04:38.141
I know, Wheeler. I know the way he
thinks, I know the way he reacts.

01:04:38.143 --> 01:04:40.976
If he figures out a way
off this thing, it's over.

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:42.378
He ain't getting
off of this ship.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.413
We've stopped him twice now.
Where's he gonna go?

01:04:44.415 --> 01:04:47.349
I don't know, it's your boat.

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:49.953
Looks like you're starting to get
a little flush there, Rhodes.

01:04:49.955 --> 01:04:52.489
- You don't know my employer.
- Let me guess.

01:04:52.491 --> 01:04:55.358
The Russians, the Chinese,
maybe the Koreans.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.828
- Does it make a difference?
- No, it doesn't.

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:00.396
As long as the money clears.

01:05:00.398 --> 01:05:02.565
Just find him.

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:04.002
Come on.

01:05:20.451 --> 01:05:21.953
Ah, fuck.

01:05:25.357 --> 01:05:26.826
Perfect.

01:05:30.228 --> 01:05:32.098
You've been shot before.

01:05:33.098 --> 01:05:35.101
Why, you surprised?

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:40.572
Look, I'm hoping that
you have a new plan.

01:05:42.507 --> 01:05:45.074
I was kind of hoping you did.

01:05:45.076 --> 01:05:48.011
Yeah, well, it's gonna be a little
difficult considering Rhodes seem to know

01:05:48.013 --> 01:05:51.350
every single one
of your moves before you do.

01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:53.953
Who is he?

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:56.987
Just someone I misjudged.

01:05:56.989 --> 01:06:00.190
Yeah, no, it's more than that.

01:06:00.192 --> 01:06:03.025
Look, I'm taking
a leap of faith with you.

01:06:03.027 --> 01:06:06.496
You want me to trust you,
you have to trust me.

01:06:06.498 --> 01:06:08.067
What's going on?

01:06:12.404 --> 01:06:14.103
He recruited me.

01:06:14.105 --> 01:06:16.139
I spent years reporting to him

01:06:16.141 --> 01:06:18.574
until he was transferred
to Intelligence.

01:06:18.576 --> 01:06:22.212
Last time I saw him he was
talking about retirement.

01:06:22.214 --> 01:06:24.179
What's on those files?

01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:28.585
It's an algorithm detailing how
we activate our sleeper agents.

01:06:28.587 --> 01:06:33.626
If it falls into the hands
of the wrong people, it's over.

01:06:39.931 --> 01:06:43.065
Com, we reached full pump
on negative tank!

01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:46.168
Flooding is slowed, we got it!

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:48.304
Copy, Sommer, how we looking?

01:06:48.306 --> 01:06:52.878
Water pressure's normal.
And tank defaults restored.

01:06:56.447 --> 01:06:58.614
Radio those boys
and bring them back.

01:06:58.616 --> 01:07:01.418
And set your course
for periscope depth.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.056
Aye, captain, setting course
for periscope depth.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:10.061
[Weddle] <i>What do you want me
to do about the crew?</i>

01:07:14.565 --> 01:07:16.132
Send them packing.

01:07:16.134 --> 01:07:18.404
Alright, copy that.

01:07:24.543 --> 01:07:26.479
[alarm stops]

01:07:30.014 --> 01:07:33.252
Looks like they stopped it.
What now?

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.286
They're still out there.

01:07:36.288 --> 01:07:38.621
We need to level
the playing field.

01:07:38.623 --> 01:07:40.659
How, there's only two of us?

01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:46.631
It's time to change that.

01:07:56.775 --> 01:07:59.509
I don't like what he saw
when that door doesn't open.

01:07:59.511 --> 01:08:00.980
Okay?

01:08:06.752 --> 01:08:09.385
I see you brought the rookie.

01:08:09.387 --> 01:08:12.122
How the hell did you know that?

01:08:12.124 --> 01:08:16.028
No one else wearing that cheap
perfume down here, sweetheart.

01:08:16.794 --> 01:08:18.528
She's a friend.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:20.433
Could use another.

01:08:22.801 --> 01:08:26.337
Haven't you heard,
friends will get you killed?

01:08:30.408 --> 01:08:34.612
I'm looking to get out of here. Would
be very nice to have an extra hand.

01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:40.183
What does she think about that?

01:08:40.185 --> 01:08:43.219
[Cass] Well, that depends on what
you're really doing down here.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:48.058
Never seen you on the manifest, you're
names not on any of the official logs.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:52.362
Well, I guess the term
is ghost detainees.

01:08:52.363 --> 01:08:55.301
That's right,
well, my question is why.

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:02.604
Let's just say I got a terminal
case of I know too much.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:07.143
Your people can't kill me and they
can't exactly let me go either.

01:09:07.145 --> 01:09:09.682
[speaking foreign language]

01:09:12.283 --> 01:09:14.684
[speaking foreign language]

01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:19.125
He's KSK.
German Special Forces.

01:09:23.462 --> 01:09:26.694
Okay, so, say we do
make it to the com

01:09:26.697 --> 01:09:31.435
and we get the sub back,
then what are you gonna do?

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.740
Say, "You're welcome."

01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:41.144
How much longer do you wanna
wait this thing out?

01:09:41.145 --> 01:09:45.180
Let's give 'em another sweep.
We still have a bit of time.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:48.184
You know, I really think that we
should consider our second option.

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:50.118
No, no, it's too soon.

01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:52.889
And at what point will it
be too fucking late, hmm?

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.261
[rumbling]

01:10:14.745 --> 01:10:16.414
Shit, come on.

01:10:20.518 --> 01:10:22.288
Now would be good.

01:10:23.855 --> 01:10:26.855
Darrows.
Darrows, do you hear me?

01:10:26.857 --> 01:10:29.425
Kingsley, we're climbing.

01:10:29.427 --> 01:10:31.528
No shit, we're climbing.
Darrows...

01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:34.229
Captain Darrows,
what are you doing?

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:36.565
Kingsley, this charter
has encountered

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:38.868
it's fair share
of bent shit cans.

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:41.403
Now, I don't know what the hell
is going on back there,

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:44.908
<i>but my command
supersedes your authority.</i>

01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:47.676
I'm also surfacing the vessel
at the nearest port

01:10:47.678 --> 01:10:49.746
and waiting for further orders
from Langley.

01:10:49.748 --> 01:10:52.482
You will do no such thing.
Stay your course, captain.

01:10:52.484 --> 01:10:55.551
That'll be all, Kingsley.

01:10:55.553 --> 01:10:58.757
Officer of the deck, open the
locker and let's arm ourselves.

01:11:00.225 --> 01:11:02.294
I'm not taking any chances.

01:11:07.365 --> 01:11:08.698
I need to get up there.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:12.170
[beeping]

01:11:13.204 --> 01:11:15.738
[Rhodes] What exactly is that?

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.873
[Kingsley] Taylor just accessed
the cell door.

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:19.576
[Rhodes] Which one?

01:11:19.578 --> 01:11:22.845
Son of a bitch,
he's grabbing Marco.

01:11:22.847 --> 01:11:24.683
Who the fuck is Marco?

01:11:27.352 --> 01:11:30.256
I believe we should
get you one of these.

01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:33.756
I knew I liked you.

01:11:33.758 --> 01:11:36.662
[Kingsley] Take Dax, go check it out.
I'm heading to the front.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:40.529
Hold on, Kingsley, hold on.

01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:43.533
I think you should go with them and
you should let me handle Darrows.

01:11:43.535 --> 01:11:46.402
I think we should throw
everything we have at Wheeler.

01:11:46.404 --> 01:11:49.471
And, besides, Darrows may be
captain but I'm agency.

01:11:49.473 --> 01:11:52.742
And I think I can persuade him.

01:11:52.744 --> 01:11:55.711
To him you're just
a hired hand, right?

01:11:55.713 --> 01:11:57.917
Yeah, fine.

01:12:03.788 --> 01:12:07.226
Get the package ready.
You know what to do.

01:12:10.294 --> 01:12:11.994
I think we really
have to move fast on this.

01:12:11.996 --> 01:12:15.631
You can't let him off this boat.
You understand that, right?

01:12:15.633 --> 01:12:17.235
I'm on it.

01:12:22.273 --> 01:12:24.006
Weddle, you're with me.

01:12:24.008 --> 01:12:26.609
Dax, take the two men
down to the crew cell block.

01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:28.814
- Check it out.
- Got it.

01:12:30.315 --> 01:12:32.484
Set rep every five minutes.

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.385
Flash bangs coming.

01:12:35.387 --> 01:12:37.519
We're done fucking around, boys.

01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:40.355
Come on, let's go!

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:41.991
Alright, they should be
closing in any minute.

01:12:41.993 --> 01:12:43.926
But I think if we take positions
on the other end,

01:12:43.928 --> 01:12:45.994
we can corner them
and get a drop from behind.

01:12:45.996 --> 01:12:47.999
Actually, you know,
I got a better idea.

01:12:49.034 --> 01:12:50.969
But she's not gonna like it.

01:12:53.338 --> 01:12:56.338
Six-hundred and twenty-five
feet, captain.

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.007
- What's the closest port?
- Havana.

01:12:59.009 --> 01:13:03.445
About 45 clicks southeast.
But we're gonna need clearance.

01:13:03.447 --> 01:13:04.814
[clears throat]

01:13:04.816 --> 01:13:06.049
Who the hell are you?

01:13:06.051 --> 01:13:08.587
Edward Rhodes, I'm with agency.

01:13:10.088 --> 01:13:11.854
[Darrow] You're not authorized
to be in here, agent.

01:13:11.856 --> 01:13:14.690
No, sir, I'm sorry.
I take full-responsibility.

01:13:14.692 --> 01:13:16.893
I apologize but we have
an urgent matter below

01:13:16.895 --> 01:13:19.662
and you and I need to talk,
captain.

01:13:19.664 --> 01:13:21.863
- Well, there's a radio for that.
- I understand.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:23.735
I couldn't risk it.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:27.869
I believe Kingsley
has been compromised.

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:30.405
Now, you know broke protocol,
you know that.

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:33.443
But the situation
has since worsened

01:13:33.445 --> 01:13:35.811
and, I could really
use your help, sir.

01:13:35.813 --> 01:13:38.747
What in God's name
is going on back there?

01:13:38.749 --> 01:13:42.385
[sighs] Now you know I'm not supposed
to answer that question, sir.

01:13:42.387 --> 01:13:44.386
Well, you better try.

01:13:44.388 --> 01:13:49.625
Okay, one of the detainees on
board used to be one of ours.

01:13:49.627 --> 01:13:51.961
He's extremely cunning,
incredibly lethal,

01:13:51.963 --> 01:13:56.366
and he has information that is
vital to our national security.

01:13:56.368 --> 01:14:02.137
Well, he managed to escape during
interrogation and he is wandering below.

01:14:02.139 --> 01:14:05.841
I'm not sure,
but I think he got to Kingsley

01:14:05.843 --> 01:14:08.810
and made some kind of deal
with him and his men.

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:12.482
Now, they can't truly escape
until you surface.

01:14:12.484 --> 01:14:14.917
So I'm just asking for
a little time,

01:14:14.919 --> 01:14:18.921
hopefully my men can
neutralize this situation.

01:14:18.923 --> 01:14:23.795
I mean, please captain, can you just
maintain this depth for a short while?

01:14:29.066 --> 01:14:32.033
Alright, Agent Rhodes.

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:34.670
But I'm gonna verify
a few things.

01:14:34.672 --> 01:14:36.342
Thank you, sir.

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:39.876
Float the coms buoy.

01:14:39.878 --> 01:14:41.447
Aye, captain.

01:14:43.047 --> 01:14:44.782
[exhales]

01:14:52.423 --> 01:14:53.558
What the...

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:56.594
How 'bout that?

01:15:18.482 --> 01:15:19.614
Psst.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:20.985
[grunting]

01:16:10.668 --> 01:16:12.737
[grunting]

01:16:50.874 --> 01:16:52.610
[groans]

01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:06.822
[groans]

01:17:06.824 --> 01:17:08.927
[panting]

01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:14.229
- Are you okay?
- [Cass] Yeah.

01:17:14.231 --> 01:17:16.267
I mean good call on the blood.

01:17:25.043 --> 01:17:28.277
[Kingsley] <i>Dax, do you read?</i>

01:17:28.279 --> 01:17:30.915
<i>Dax, do you copy!</i>

01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:35.786
<i>Dax!</i>

01:17:38.155 --> 01:17:40.057
[gunfire]

01:17:41.593 --> 01:17:43.626
[Marco]
<i>Taking fire, Taylor's down!</i>

01:17:43.628 --> 01:17:45.760
Taylor's down, incoming!

01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:46.831
[gunfire]

01:17:52.337 --> 01:17:55.971
- We gotta get over there.
- Wait.

01:17:55.973 --> 01:17:57.707
Do we have eyes on Wheeler?

01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:59.711
Taking fire, advancing!

01:18:00.878 --> 01:18:04.145
I got a visual,
he's down, he's hurt!

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:05.616
[grunts]

01:18:09.219 --> 01:18:10.655
Say, hi, asshole.

01:18:12.289 --> 01:18:14.191
[Wheeler] <i>Fuck you.</i>

01:18:20.664 --> 01:18:23.032
What about the prisoner?

01:18:23.034 --> 01:18:25.003
No longer an issue.

01:18:26.904 --> 01:18:29.872
Get 'em up to the mess hall.
Good work, men.

01:18:29.874 --> 01:18:31.340
Should we
call it in to Rhodes?

01:18:31.342 --> 01:18:35.310
No. I don't trust
that son of a bitch.

01:18:35.312 --> 01:18:37.682
I need to talk to Wheeler first.

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.152
Copy that.

01:18:44.288 --> 01:18:47.723
- Well, your story checks out.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:47.725 --> 01:18:50.292
But we're still being ordered
to dock in Havana.

01:18:50.294 --> 01:18:53.031
Extraction team
is already en route.

01:18:54.065 --> 01:18:55.898
You just bought yourself
some time.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.804
Thank you, captain, thank you.

01:19:07.344 --> 01:19:08.879
[buzzing]

01:19:18.388 --> 01:19:20.322
You look nervous.

01:19:20.324 --> 01:19:23.359
- You're not?
- I never saw the point.

01:19:23.361 --> 01:19:27.232
And usually I shoot the other
guy before he shoots me.

01:19:28.199 --> 01:19:29.768
Of course.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.810
Okay, let's do this.

01:20:09.373 --> 01:20:10.942
[soft chuckle]

01:20:29.861 --> 01:20:32.094
[Kingsley] Wheeler...

01:20:32.096 --> 01:20:35.965
I'm glad you could
finally join us.

01:20:35.967 --> 01:20:40.769
I thought perhaps you and I could
talk before getting Agent Rhodes.

01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:44.375
- He's not here?
- No, he is not.

01:20:46.477 --> 01:20:48.914
Then this should be
over quickly.

01:20:54.552 --> 01:20:56.188
[groaning]

01:21:00.557 --> 01:21:02.323
I was gonna
cut you in on a deal,

01:21:02.325 --> 01:21:05.262
I swear I was gonna
cut you in on a deal.

01:21:07.397 --> 01:21:09.899
Where's Rhodes?

01:21:09.901 --> 01:21:12.100
Fuck you.

01:21:12.102 --> 01:21:13.804
[groans]

01:21:21.212 --> 01:21:24.380
He's somewhere upfront
playing bureaucrat.

01:21:24.382 --> 01:21:27.049
How many of your guys
are with him?

01:21:27.051 --> 01:21:30.054
One guy. That's it.

01:21:32.123 --> 01:21:33.991
What do you want to do with him?

01:21:41.264 --> 01:21:42.931
[grunts]

01:21:42.933 --> 01:21:45.167
Don't, don't...
please don't kill me.

01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:47.336
I'm not gonna kill you,
Kingsley.

01:21:47.338 --> 01:21:51.409
I can imagine he has a few words
he'd like to say to you.

01:21:54.411 --> 01:21:56.945
He's all yours.

01:21:56.947 --> 01:22:00.248
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:04.121
I guess this is the part where I'm
supposed to tell you that I owe you one.

01:22:05.289 --> 01:22:07.189
Pretty sure, yeah.

01:22:07.191 --> 01:22:10.592
- Good luck.
- Try not to have too much fun.

01:22:10.594 --> 01:22:12.396
Don't worry...

01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:17.533
I know exactly
what to do with him.

01:22:17.535 --> 01:22:21.002
- ETA 11 minutes, sir.
- [captain] Copy.

01:22:21.004 --> 01:22:24.172
Echo one, we're 11 minutes out.

01:22:24.174 --> 01:22:27.945
<i>Requesting docking coordinates.</i>

01:22:40.357 --> 01:22:41.892
[man] Copy that.

01:22:59.944 --> 01:23:01.676
[buzzing]

01:23:01.678 --> 01:23:03.547
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:23:15.092 --> 01:23:18.359
Chief of the boat,
make your depth 75 feet.

01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:19.931
[chief] Aye, captain.

01:23:22.967 --> 01:23:25.400
It's not looking good.

01:23:25.402 --> 01:23:27.071
Uh-uh, keep them up.

01:23:31.475 --> 01:23:34.976
- What the hell is this?
- Jesus Christ.

01:23:34.978 --> 01:23:36.612
Captain,
my name is Cassie Taylor.

01:23:36.614 --> 01:23:38.646
I'm an agent on board.

01:23:38.648 --> 01:23:40.616
Whatever this guy's saying
is a complete lie.

01:23:40.618 --> 01:23:44.286
- Unbelievable.
- He's operating without clearance.

01:23:44.288 --> 01:23:46.287
He's killed half of our men,
including my partner.

01:23:46.289 --> 01:23:48.426
You cannot trust him.

01:23:49.627 --> 01:23:52.327
- Is that him?
- That's correct, captain.

01:23:52.329 --> 01:23:56.098
We can prove everything.
All I need is a line out.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:59.368
Just two minutes,
you can monitor the whole thing.

01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:01.135
[captain] You gotta be joking.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:03.604
Do all you company men
rehearse the same way?

01:24:03.606 --> 01:24:05.440
He already got that deal.

01:24:05.442 --> 01:24:08.280
And guess what?
It panned out.

01:24:10.647 --> 01:24:12.116
Where's your guy?

01:24:13.351 --> 01:24:15.216
Come on, Wheeler,
stop the charade.

01:24:15.218 --> 01:24:17.185
You know you murdered
everyone on the boat.

01:24:17.187 --> 01:24:19.958
Wheeler, look,
they set the course to dock.

01:24:32.402 --> 01:24:37.271
Captain, you can take my gun.

01:24:37.273 --> 01:24:39.640
We can wait until
the team arrive.

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:42.310
Captain,
this man is extremely lethal.

01:24:42.312 --> 01:24:44.345
Things could get out of hand
really quickly.

01:24:44.347 --> 01:24:48.117
I suggest you command your men to
make a move right now, captain.

01:24:48.119 --> 01:24:49.417
Go on, take it.

01:24:49.419 --> 01:24:50.752
[Cass] Captain, think about it.

01:24:50.754 --> 01:24:52.554
If anything
he was saying was true,

01:24:52.556 --> 01:24:54.122
we wouldn't be willing
to hold out with you.

01:24:54.124 --> 01:24:55.256
[Rhodes]
Captain, don't listen to them.

01:24:55.258 --> 01:24:56.558
Alright, they're playing you.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.094
This is exactly
what we train them to do.

01:24:59.096 --> 01:25:01.366
Have your men move, now!

01:25:02.532 --> 01:25:04.533
I think I've heard enough.

01:25:04.535 --> 01:25:09.137
I don't give a good goddamn which
one of you is spinning the yarn.

01:25:09.139 --> 01:25:13.074
So I think I'll let
Langley decide.

01:25:13.076 --> 01:25:19.284
In the meantime, Agent Rhodes, I
think I'm gonna have to take that.

01:25:21.352 --> 01:25:23.388
Sure, just take it.

01:25:24.722 --> 01:25:29.058
Cut the chase, back off,
back off! Now, back off!

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:33.228
Everybody don't move! I'll put a
bullet in his head, I swear to God.

01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:37.166
Okay, everybody stay calm.
We're all gonna stay alive.

01:25:37.168 --> 01:25:38.466
Captain, this is
what you're gonna do.

01:25:38.468 --> 01:25:40.101
You're gonna command your men

01:25:40.103 --> 01:25:42.304
to alter the coordinates
to surface

01:25:42.306 --> 01:25:44.806
before the port
as close to land as possible.

01:25:44.808 --> 01:25:47.775
- Like hell I will.
- Okay, I understand.

01:25:47.777 --> 01:25:50.546
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

01:25:50.548 --> 01:25:51.646
Godamnit!

01:25:51.648 --> 01:25:53.582
Issue the order right now

01:25:53.584 --> 01:25:56.585
or I will shoot you
and I will shoot your men!

01:25:56.587 --> 01:25:58.586
Issue the order!
Do it!

01:25:58.588 --> 01:26:00.257
Take it up!

01:26:04.227 --> 01:26:08.764
Command your men to drop their sidearms
to the floor and kick them over.

01:26:08.766 --> 01:26:10.832
Tell them, now.

01:26:10.834 --> 01:26:13.801
Sinclair, lower your side arm.

01:26:13.803 --> 01:26:15.470
[Rhodes]
That's right, nice and easy.

01:26:15.472 --> 01:26:17.706
Drop your sidearms.
Drop 'em now!

01:26:17.708 --> 01:26:21.443
On the ground!
Drop 'em on the ground!

01:26:21.445 --> 01:26:23.244
Back the fuck up, Scott!

01:26:23.246 --> 01:26:25.247
I'll blow your fucking head off!

01:26:25.249 --> 01:26:27.448
Kick your guns over here,
both of them.

01:26:27.450 --> 01:26:30.288
Kick the fucking gun over here!

01:26:31.321 --> 01:26:33.221
Very good.

01:26:33.223 --> 01:26:35.457
Cass, drop your weapon.

01:26:35.459 --> 01:26:38.127
- Go fuck yourself.
- Really?

01:26:38.129 --> 01:26:43.165
Okay, well,
maybe he'll help you out.

01:26:43.167 --> 01:26:45.533
- Fuck.
- Put the gun...

01:26:45.535 --> 01:26:48.338
Put it down
on the fucking table.

01:26:51.775 --> 01:26:55.409
Too bad, Wheeler. She would've
made an incredible partner.

01:26:55.411 --> 01:26:57.749
She's loyal right to the end.

01:26:59.182 --> 01:27:00.415
I know how to pick them.

01:27:00.417 --> 01:27:03.754
Not exactly.
Agent Ballard!

01:27:12.262 --> 01:27:13.597
Hi, Scott.

01:27:16.834 --> 01:27:18.403
I saw you die.

01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:23.575
[chuckle] You saw what
I wanted you to see.

01:27:41.926 --> 01:27:43.328
[phone ringing]

01:27:50.234 --> 01:27:52.536
[Mel] <i>Rhodes knew we were on it
from the word go.</i>

01:27:53.971 --> 01:27:55.639
<i>That's why he cut me in.</i>

01:28:11.888 --> 01:28:14.523
Don't beat yourself up
about it, Scott.

01:28:14.525 --> 01:28:16.958
We both did our job.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.864
I just did mine
a little bit better.

01:28:25.803 --> 01:28:28.173
Go. Put it down.

01:28:33.343 --> 01:28:34.611
Hand it over.

01:28:46.723 --> 01:28:49.757
- You get it?
- [Rhodes] Not exactly.

01:28:49.759 --> 01:28:51.827
But there's more than enough
to split three ways.

01:28:51.829 --> 01:28:53.828
We need to cut our losses
and move now.

01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:56.598
- No, I didn't agree to that.
- We don't have a choice.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.269
The deal was they were gonna wire the
money once we gave them the second piece.

01:29:00.271 --> 01:29:04.973
Now we don't have it. So it's
still a win, don't be greedy.

01:29:04.975 --> 01:29:06.608
[scoffs]

01:29:06.610 --> 01:29:08.980
Greed is the reason we're here.

01:29:20.023 --> 01:29:21.957
Let's take him with us.

01:29:21.959 --> 01:29:23.792
I'll get him to talk.

01:29:23.794 --> 01:29:26.598
[Rhodes]
It's too risky, just let it go.

01:29:27.563 --> 01:29:29.400
[phone ringing]

01:29:33.704 --> 01:29:37.338
Jesus Christ. You, you.

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:40.611
Answer that phone,
put it on speaker.

01:29:48.686 --> 01:29:51.319
This is Captain Darrows.

01:29:51.321 --> 01:29:54.655
[man] <i>Copy that.
Darrows, echo, zero, five.</i>

01:29:54.657 --> 01:29:58.295
<i>We're about two mikes out,
do you copy?</i>

01:30:00.963 --> 01:30:04.868
Affirmative.
Coordinates are locked in.

01:30:06.837 --> 01:30:08.936
I can see them now.

01:30:08.938 --> 01:30:11.506
[man] <i>Good, as soon as you land
disengage your forward hatch</i>

01:30:11.508 --> 01:30:13.007
<i>so my man can board.</i>

01:30:13.009 --> 01:30:15.344
<i>We want this to be
easy sledding.</i>

01:30:15.346 --> 01:30:17.712
Understood, over.

01:30:17.714 --> 01:30:19.417
[Rhodes] Put it down.

01:30:24.554 --> 01:30:27.592
[droning]

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.848
Okay.

01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:57.922
Tell him to unlock
the forward hatch.

01:31:05.462 --> 01:31:10.067
Hey, amuse me,
was any of it real?

01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:14.168
The sex wasn't bad.

01:31:14.170 --> 01:31:18.439
[chuckles]
I guess she'll never find out.

01:31:18.441 --> 01:31:21.044
Please, you've only
been dead for two days.

01:31:22.945 --> 01:31:24.546
Look,
it's nothing personal, Scott,

01:31:24.548 --> 01:31:26.715
but it would take two lifetimes

01:31:26.717 --> 01:31:28.417
to make this kinda cash
chasing guys

01:31:28.419 --> 01:31:30.885
we both know
get replaced on a dime.

01:31:30.887 --> 01:31:33.521
If you can't beat them,
join them.

01:31:33.523 --> 01:31:34.792
Hm.

01:31:40.664 --> 01:31:42.367
You're crazy.

01:31:45.803 --> 01:31:47.004
Jesus.

01:31:52.176 --> 01:31:54.111
[Rhodes]
We have to go, Mel.

01:31:57.548 --> 01:32:00.849
You're gonna get caught. You
think offsetting the coordinates

01:32:00.851 --> 01:32:03.585
by a couple
miles is gonna change anything?

01:32:03.587 --> 01:32:07.087
Someone's bound to see you trying to
make it to shore. You'll be fugitives.

01:32:07.089 --> 01:32:11.859
[Rhodes] Really? Thanks.
Are you finished?

01:32:11.861 --> 01:32:14.829
Good. You can kill her.

01:32:14.831 --> 01:32:17.732
Wait! Wait.

01:32:17.734 --> 01:32:19.900
I will tell you
where it is okay?

01:32:19.902 --> 01:32:24.909
If you want the dongle,
let her go, it's yours.

01:32:27.044 --> 01:32:29.211
Where is it?

01:32:29.213 --> 01:32:33.247
In a safe deposit box, okay?

01:32:33.249 --> 01:32:36.818
- He's lying, let's go.
- Yeah, well, what if he isn't?

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.686
Don't be a fool.

01:32:38.688 --> 01:32:40.521
You made
a small fortune already.

01:32:40.523 --> 01:32:42.122
No, we're talking about
millions here.

01:32:42.124 --> 01:32:46.029
Hey, hey, hey, Ballard.
Watch yourself.

01:32:48.798 --> 01:32:50.966
Give me the location, Scott.

01:32:50.968 --> 01:32:55.673
- Give me your word she lives.
- God damn it, let's go!

01:33:02.779 --> 01:33:05.514
You have my word.

01:33:05.516 --> 01:33:07.618
Fuck this, you're dead!

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.736
[grunting]

01:33:35.846 --> 01:33:36.912
Wheeler!

01:33:36.914 --> 01:33:38.979
[yelling]

01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:41.585
[grunting]

01:34:08.245 --> 01:34:10.982
- [choking]
- You pain in my ass, you!

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:14.718
Shoot her!

01:34:16.186 --> 01:34:18.822
Goddamn it, Ballard, shoot her!

01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:23.194
Shoot her, Ballard, shoot her!

01:34:25.361 --> 01:34:27.061
Goddamn it!

01:34:27.063 --> 01:34:29.764
[grunting]

01:34:29.766 --> 01:34:32.000
[Rhodes] Shoot her! Ballard!

01:34:32.002 --> 01:34:34.071
[groaning]

01:34:37.374 --> 01:34:40.007
You bitch! Bitch!

01:34:40.009 --> 01:34:41.811
[gunshots]

01:34:48.317 --> 01:34:51.819
- Wheeler!
- Yeah, you gotta get to Ballard.

01:34:51.821 --> 01:34:55.323
- Jesus Christ, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:34:55.325 --> 01:34:57.962
- We got to go, come on.
- Are you sure?

01:35:18.848 --> 01:35:20.317
This way!

01:35:36.932 --> 01:35:39.067
On the ground!
On the ground, now!

01:35:39.069 --> 01:35:42.302
[all yelling]

01:35:42.304 --> 01:35:44.374
I'm deputy, don't shoot!

01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:47.308
We have an escaped target!

01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:49.243
She just ran out of here,
you need to find her!

01:35:49.245 --> 01:35:51.081
- [man] Hands behind your back!
- He's been shot, he needs help!

01:36:17.441 --> 01:36:20.277
- [woman] They're ready for you.
- Okay, great, thank you.

01:36:26.316 --> 01:36:28.882
Agent Taylor, sir.

01:36:28.884 --> 01:36:30.387
Thank you.

01:36:32.088 --> 01:36:33.421
- Hello.
- Agent Taylor.

01:36:33.423 --> 01:36:34.922
- Hi.
- Please, have a seat.

01:36:34.924 --> 01:36:36.793
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:36:40.362 --> 01:36:42.796
Anything you'd like to say
before we start?

01:36:42.798 --> 01:36:46.266
- No, sir.
- Good.

01:36:46.268 --> 01:36:49.104
We've looked over your report
and it seems to fall in line

01:36:49.106 --> 01:36:51.805
with Agent Wheeler's statement.

01:36:51.807 --> 01:36:53.408
Now, I'd be remiss
if I didn't say

01:36:53.410 --> 01:36:56.810
his vindication was in part
due to your testimony.

01:36:56.812 --> 01:37:00.083
Now, having said that...

01:37:02.753 --> 01:37:07.788
this is one of the biggest fuck
ups to ever come across my desk.

01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:12.127
The panel can't open an inquiry
because the Black Site doesn't exist.

01:37:12.129 --> 01:37:14.229
And we can't label
the source of the leak

01:37:14.231 --> 01:37:15.930
because that would mean
admitting to a failure

01:37:15.932 --> 01:37:18.466
that we weren't prepared for.

01:37:18.468 --> 01:37:22.103
I've got six dead agents,
three civilians,

01:37:22.105 --> 01:37:26.043
and an oversight committee
breathing down my neck.

01:37:28.277 --> 01:37:30.110
I knew Tom Drummond.

01:37:30.112 --> 01:37:33.280
He was a good agent
and one smart son of a bitch.

01:37:33.282 --> 01:37:35.984
But the second he got autonomy
to run that division

01:37:35.986 --> 01:37:39.119
was the second that we had
to start answering for it.

01:37:39.121 --> 01:37:41.922
You understand?

01:37:41.924 --> 01:37:43.093
Yes, sir.

01:37:44.294 --> 01:37:46.263
As for Agent Ballard...

01:37:55.137 --> 01:37:58.475
<i>We've been trying to track her movements
since she disappeared in Cuba.</i>

01:38:00.477 --> 01:38:05.546
<i>Interpol tracked her to down
to some bodega in Caracas,</i>

01:38:05.548 --> 01:38:09.386
<i>while another dead end led us
to a safe house in Peru.</i>

01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:19.096
<i>Wherever she is,
she's being careful.</i>

01:38:30.106 --> 01:38:33.440
<i>Now, if there's anything good
to come out of this,</i>

01:38:33.442 --> 01:38:35.176
it's the fact that
we were able to recover

01:38:35.178 --> 01:38:37.545
a terabyte of data
from an encrypted server

01:38:37.547 --> 01:38:39.479
that Rhodes was accessing.

01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:43.350
This should help us locate
and identify his buyer.

01:38:43.352 --> 01:38:47.056
How would you like to be part
of the team that takes him down?

01:38:49.325 --> 01:38:52.493
Yes, of course, sir.

01:38:52.495 --> 01:38:54.528
- Thank you.
- Good.

01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:58.301
I trust you won't have any issue
with your new partner?

01:39:01.937 --> 01:39:03.039
No.

01:39:04.273 --> 01:39:06.573
Then that's all for now.

01:39:06.575 --> 01:39:07.877
Thank you.

01:39:10.446 --> 01:39:14.349
[man] Oh, Agent Taylor, one
more thing before you go.

01:39:14.351 --> 01:39:18.619
When our team went in to sweep the
site they took log of the detainees.

01:39:18.621 --> 01:39:22.090
All of them have been
accounted for except one.

01:39:22.092 --> 01:39:24.058
A German.

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:27.295
When they located his cell
they found Kingsley naked.

01:39:27.297 --> 01:39:32.000
Tied to a toilet
with three of his guards.

01:39:32.002 --> 01:39:36.272
Son of a bitch insisted
he was being coerced.

01:39:37.473 --> 01:39:39.239
You know anything about that?

01:39:39.241 --> 01:39:41.309
Can't say that I do.

01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:44.348
- Mm-hm.
- Thank you.

01:39:50.152 --> 01:39:52.619
- Did he call yet?
- No, not yet.

01:39:52.621 --> 01:39:54.087
Hm.

01:39:54.089 --> 01:39:57.257
- [engine starts]
- [knocking]

01:39:57.259 --> 01:39:59.327
[speaking foreign language]

01:39:59.329 --> 01:40:01.595
- Go.
- [knocking]

01:40:01.597 --> 01:40:02.932
Fuck off.

01:40:13.509 --> 01:40:15.646
[phone ringing]

01:40:17.079 --> 01:40:18.448
Yeah?

01:40:20.316 --> 01:40:22.449
Consider us even, friend.

01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:25.319
[Wheeler]
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:26.923
You too.

01:40:32.594 --> 01:40:37.265
So, Special Agent Taylor.
Has a nice ring to it.

01:40:37.267 --> 01:40:39.199
It does, doesn't it?

01:40:39.201 --> 01:40:41.635
Tell me something,

01:40:41.637 --> 01:40:43.704
where did you really
hide the dongle?

01:40:43.706 --> 01:40:48.478
- Exactly where I said.
- In a safe deposit box?

01:40:50.213 --> 01:40:52.613
So you actually
stopped at a bank?

01:40:52.615 --> 01:40:55.149
I got an account and everything.

01:40:55.151 --> 01:40:58.051
I hate to break it to you
but you know that spy stuff?

01:40:58.053 --> 01:41:00.054
It's not so exciting.

01:41:00.056 --> 01:41:02.055
Hmm.

01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:04.524
- Really?
- I swear.

01:41:04.526 --> 01:41:06.661
Most of the time
you stay in a shitty motel.

01:41:06.663 --> 01:41:10.064
Shitty bed.
Hopefully, no shitty breakfast.

01:41:10.066 --> 01:41:11.535
- [laughter]
- [groans]

01:41:13.069 --> 01:41:14.435
[Cass] I forgot you got shot.

01:41:14.437 --> 01:41:17.141
- Huh?
- How's he doing?

01:41:20.864 --> 01:41:25.864
