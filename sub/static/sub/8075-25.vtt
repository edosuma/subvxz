00:03.671 --> 00:06.440
[music playing]

00:08.909 --> 00:09.943
There, there, there.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.579
That's perfect, honey.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.414
Just when I'm get
used to these pillows,

00:13.447 --> 00:15.849
it's time to check out.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.686
Yeah, well, there's two
of them in the suitcase.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.055
And DJ managed to sneak one
out of here under his coat

00:21.089 --> 00:23.757
yesterday.

00:23.791 --> 00:24.692
Ready for your lunch?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.360
Yes, please.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.895
Oh man, I hate to
this hospital food.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.263
It's horrible.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.299
Do you think I could get them
to put me back on the IV.

00:34.368 --> 00:39.807
Well, just hold your
nose now, here goes.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.842
Get ready for some steak.

00:44.945 --> 00:49.317
Mmm, juicy and charbroiled,
just the way I like it.

00:49.350 --> 00:53.654
Paid for by the insurance,
just the way I like it.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.357
I feel so much better
when you baby me.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.526
Well, I'm going to be taking
care of you the whole time,

00:58.559 --> 00:59.960
Dan.
You have nothing to worry about.

00:59.993 --> 01:00.861
Thanks, honey.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.864
Shrimp scampi, please.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.067
Mmm, shrimpy.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.938
I think we should go over
these doctors instructions

01:10.971 --> 01:12.806
here.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.109
Recovering from a
heart attack requires

01:15.143 --> 01:19.413
the patient's cooperation
and self-discipline.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.450
You're dead.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.718
Hey, no exercise
for two weeks.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.588
Well that shouldn't be hard,
you've gone on a lot longer

01:27.621 --> 01:29.357
than two weeks.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.991
Look at number two, though.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.294
No S-E-X for four weeks.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.662
That'll be hard.

01:34.695 --> 01:38.666
Thank god I don't have
to go by this list.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.869
Mr. Conner, all
your tests look great.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.903
Did you hear that, Dan?

01:42.936 --> 01:43.804
You're going to live.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.574
I'm going to live.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.478
Now all you gotta do is
get something to live for.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.213
You can pack up and leave
as soon as you're ready.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.113
That's great.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.648
Thanks, doc.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.984
You take it easy.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.287
Man, I can't wait to
get back home again.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.621
Well, you know,
a lot of things

02:00.654 --> 02:02.122
have changed since
you've been there.

02:02.156 --> 02:05.259
The rose gardens
are in full bloom.

02:05.293 --> 02:09.563
We moved the Renoir
to the east wing.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.500
And three of your polo
ponies have gone to foal.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.334
Ah, spring.

02:16.337 --> 02:20.208
[music playing]

03:03.817 --> 03:06.354
Oh man, honey, it's so
good to be home again.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.055
Yeah, you spend that
time in the hospital

03:08.088 --> 03:10.624
then you look around
you think, we don't have

03:10.658 --> 03:14.127
nearly enough religious art.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.129
Everything looks so different.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.299
Was the TV always there?

03:18.332 --> 03:22.069
Yeah, you probably just never
seen it turned off before.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.671
What's all this?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.072
Tapes.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.907
While you were in the hospital
I taped all your favorite shows.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.510
Man, I didn't realize I
had that many favorite shows.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.281
I got a whole
other box upstairs.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.181
Hey dad, you're home.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.349
Did you bring me anything?

03:35.383 --> 03:38.986
Yeah, the gene for
an early heart attack.

03:39.019 --> 03:39.887
Hey, buddy.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.355
How you doing?

03:41.389 --> 03:44.024
Did you do everything I
told you while I was gone?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.760
Like barking at the mailman
when he comes around?

03:46.794 --> 03:47.995
Don't pick him up, Dan.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.631
He's 10 pounds over
your lifting limit.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.599
Hey, hey.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.666
Careful with the t-shirt.

03:52.700 --> 03:56.437
When he grows out
of it, it's mine.

03:56.470 --> 04:00.173
Well, I guess if we're all
going to go on this diet,

04:00.207 --> 04:01.609
I ought to go in there
and throw out all

04:01.642 --> 04:04.044
the stuff that's bad for us.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.781
Of course it might be
easier just to move.

04:07.815 --> 04:08.816
I'm going in there with you.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.117
Oh now, Dan.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.085
No, honey, I can't
just lie here and watch

04:12.119 --> 04:13.721
you destroy the things I love.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.527
OK, first I'm starting
with the lard products.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.295
- Oh.
- Look at that.

04:24.965 --> 04:29.202
That takes out the whole shelf.

04:29.236 --> 04:33.374
OK, now anything with
little Debbie on it.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.409
You know, it's kind of a waste
to throw all this stuff out.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.011
Maybe we should give some
of this stuff to people.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.681
Yeah, that's a good idea.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.784
Let's see.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.354
This pork and
beans, well, you've

04:46.387 --> 04:50.458
got to know how to operate a
can opener and a stove, so let's

04:50.491 --> 04:52.560
Mark out.

04:52.593 --> 04:56.096
I'll give these to
Darlene and David.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.132
And I'll give the marshmallows
to Mark and Becky.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.634
God, I feel like it's
a reading of our will.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.105
What the hell is this?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.407
I have no idea.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.240
I'll give it to mom.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.447
Oh, we got to get rid
of these eggs, Dan.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.815
Look at that.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.117
I do not want to come in here
at midnight again and catch

05:17.150 --> 05:20.187
you making a 30 yolk sandwich.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.789
Do we have to
get rid of those?

05:21.822 --> 05:25.192
My grandfather brought them
over from the old country.

05:25.225 --> 05:29.296
Ew, look at all the bugs that
died trying to get in there.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.601
Hey, I forgot this was here.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.403
I can't believe there's so much.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.804
What? what?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.305
It's that box where
we used to throw

05:38.338 --> 05:40.207
all those condiment packets.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.309
Oh man, yeah,
back when we used

05:42.342 --> 05:44.812
to try to economize and
save stuff before we

05:44.845 --> 05:46.814
said, to hell with it.

05:46.847 --> 05:52.753
Look at this, there's
ketchup, relish, soy sauce.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.389
And all of it antique.

05:55.423 --> 05:59.359
Oh look here,
McDonald's mustard.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.562
How old do you think that is?

06:01.595 --> 06:06.266
Hmm, the golden arches
have an orange hue.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.102
I'd say circa 1972.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.773
Oh and look, there's
Mayor McCheese when he was

06:12.806 --> 06:14.074
still city Councilman McCheese.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.147
You know, I heard that
some people collect stamps.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.248
Used ones?

06:21.281 --> 06:22.716
Oh.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.918
You know, you're taking
this pretty good, Dan.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.053
Well, I'll tell
you what, honey,

06:26.086 --> 06:29.189
it hasn't really been that hard.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.894
Good, because I'm going to
go over there to the fridge.

06:33.927 --> 06:34.728
Oh yeah?

06:37.598 --> 06:40.434
And I'm going to open it.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.736
Honey.

06:42.770 --> 06:47.975
Now Dan, I want you to take
a deep breath, clear your mind,

06:48.008 --> 06:50.878
and go to your special
place of tremendous courage

06:50.911 --> 06:54.147
because it's going.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.989
You might not want
to watch this.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.460
Oh!

07:06.494 --> 07:07.360
[can opening]

07:07.394 --> 07:08.328
Oh.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.229
[can opening]

07:09.262 --> 07:11.098
Ow!

07:11.131 --> 07:11.999
[can opening]

07:12.032 --> 07:12.833
Aw.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.606
[pouring sound]

07:18.639 --> 07:22.810
Oh, the humanity.

07:22.843 --> 07:27.615
[music playing]

07:27.648 --> 07:30.117
So David, you still
think camping is the best

07:30.150 --> 07:32.920
way to spend your honeymoon?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.255
Well, how often do you get back
to the hotel to visit Darlene?

07:42.095 --> 07:44.431
Now for my victory lap.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.166
Hey, you didn't
miss him at all.

07:46.199 --> 07:49.503
He just came in with DJ
from one of his walks.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.771
Darlene and David.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.605
I'll put them on speaker.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.643
Hey guys, how you doing?

07:55.676 --> 07:58.646
You're just in time to hear
me eat my Olympic victory

07:58.679 --> 08:01.048
feast, urinal cakes.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.919
Here, talk to him
like a human being.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.155
Hey guys, how you doing?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.958
Yeah, how's the food up there?

08:10.991 --> 08:13.193
Yeah, your mom and I
went camping one time

08:13.226 --> 08:14.427
up in Wisconsin, up in--

08:17.064 --> 08:17.931
That's enough.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.701
It was collect.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.469
Honey, I've been
home for two weeks.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.205
I think I can handle
talking to my children.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.473
Yeah?

08:26.506 --> 08:29.242
Well did DJ get
you off the leash

08:29.276 --> 08:31.545
long enough to
chase that Frisbee?

08:31.579 --> 08:33.280
It was great.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.183
God, it's been so long
since I've taken a walk.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.885
Didn't there used to be a
vacant lot on the corner

08:37.918 --> 08:38.986
of Vernon and Grove?

08:39.019 --> 08:39.953
Yeah, it's still there.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.154
It's just underneath
that bank they

08:41.188 --> 08:43.591
built there seven years ago.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.392
When did everybody
start putting security

08:45.425 --> 08:46.760
gates around their house?

08:46.794 --> 08:51.498
Mmm, gee, about the
time DJ started to walk.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.333
Amazing.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.135
Why don't you go in there
and lay down on the couch

08:55.168 --> 08:57.337
and I'll bring
you in your lunch.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.673
Honey, I can
make my own lunch.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.209
Why don't you work on one
of your TV commentaries.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.245
You haven't been on that show
since this whole thing started.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.814
Well, I never thought
I'd say this, Dan,

09:06.847 --> 09:10.884
but you are more
important than TV.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.559
How sad that it
took a heart attack

09:19.593 --> 09:23.563
to finally hear those words
come out of your mouth.

09:23.597 --> 09:28.501
Hey, DJ, good job in getting
your dad to go on those walks.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.939
There's a little bit
of green in it for you.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.140
Geez, this blows.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.043
Why do I have to be
on this diet, too?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.111
Because you want to
get an early start.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.447
You don't want to
end up like your dad.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.082
Yeah, well, I
guess you're right.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.185
Heart attacks are the number
one cause of teenage deaths.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.824
Hey, DJ, get in here.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.461
Candy wrapper?

09:54.494 --> 09:55.696
Yeah.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.065
What in the hell is it
doing in your dad's pocket?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.166
Is there any left?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.034
Hey, DJ.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.202
I don't know how he got it.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.638
This is unbelievable.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.840
You're going to yell
at him, aren't you?

10:06.874 --> 10:08.441
No, I don't know.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.743
Well, eating that
stuff is way wrong.

10:09.777 --> 10:10.744
Don't you care?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.012
Of course I care, DJ.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.981
But geez, the guy just
had a heart attack.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.416
It's not like I can go
in there and yell at him.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.584
Wish I had a heart attack.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.827
Damn, I have been
doubly betrayed.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.862
This is from my stash.

10:28.896 --> 10:32.265
[music playing]

10:36.469 --> 10:37.337
Here we are.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.706
Here we are.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.008
We've got two big boys all set
and ready to go to the park.

10:41.041 --> 10:41.909
I've got the drinks.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.543
I've got the snacks.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.512
And Andy's going to
feed the pigeons.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.715
Why don't you just let them
toss coins at the winos

10:47.748 --> 10:50.117
like all the other kids do.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.585
Ha ha, Roseanne.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.855
Is something wrong
with your car?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.256
I just drove past the corner.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.959
I saw Dan sitting at the
bus bench reading the paper.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.528
Oh man, that's unbelievable.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.964
He's supposed to
be out on his walk.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.200
Well, he wasn't just
reading the paper.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.071
He was turning the
pages like a demon.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.640
And that lifestyle
section, you know how

11:13.673 --> 11:16.376
heavy that is on Wednesdays.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.811
Don't take this out
on me, Roseanne,

11:17.845 --> 11:20.647
I didn't mean to see Dan.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.182
No, don't worry
about it, Jackie.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.551
You're not telling me
anything that I didn't know.

11:24.584 --> 11:25.819
I know he's been cheating.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.720
Are you sure?

11:26.754 --> 11:27.921
Yeah.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.390
I found a candy bar
wrapper in his pants

11:30.423 --> 11:31.524
when I was doing the laundry.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.326
- Oh no.
- Yeah.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.795
And then Crystal calls me.

11:34.828 --> 11:38.065
She said she saw him
yesterday at the gas station

11:38.098 --> 11:41.034
heating up a burrito.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.871
Nobody can do anything in this
town without you finding out.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.505
That's right.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.407
I hear you bought some
rash cream, what gives?

11:54.714 --> 11:58.518
Well, have you said
something to him about?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.188
No, I didn't.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.957
Cause I just was hoping it
would stop with the candy bar,

12:03.991 --> 12:04.858
you know?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.459
What was I thinking?

12:06.493 --> 12:08.261
Dan's the kind of guy that
will stand there eating

12:08.295 --> 12:10.630
a couple of frozen eggos while
he's waiting for the other ones

12:10.663 --> 12:11.865
to pop up.

12:11.899 --> 12:15.535
Well, this is not just
a little slip, Roseanne.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.304
You've got to stop him.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.505
I know I do.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.008
But the whole heart attack
thing is just so weird.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.043
I just don't even know
what to say to him.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.812
I don't know even know how
to yell at him or anything

12:24.845 --> 12:26.146
anymore.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.615
Phew, man, I got
to start stretching

12:28.648 --> 12:30.884
out before these walks.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.485
A mile and a half
is a lot longer

12:32.519 --> 12:34.487
than it was when I was a kid.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.957
A mile and a half, huh?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.859
Boy, you must be exhausted.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.427
Yeah, Dan.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.096
And yet you don't even
seem to be sweating.

12:46.834 --> 12:47.667
Yeah, park time.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.781
Boy, you know, you're not
really sweating that much.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.483
That new Speed
Stick's pretty good.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.517
Yeah.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.787
You're just dry,
dry, dry, dry, dry.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.656
I'll tell you,
it's good stuff.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.225
I ought to write them a letter.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.626
You know, Dan.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.396
It's really important that you
stick to the doctor's orders.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.464
What are you saying, Roseanne?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.399
I know it's important.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.367
I'm just saying--

13:20.400 --> 13:21.534
No look, do you
think this is easy?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.469
It's not.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.736
Now I'm hot and
tired from my walk

13:23.770 --> 13:26.473
and I'm going to go take a
shower, if you don't mind.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.009
Fine, I'll finish
making your angel hair

13:29.042 --> 13:32.312
pasta in a light tomato sauce.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.983
You're not the only one around
here that can tell lies.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.752
[music playing]

13:46.093 --> 13:47.928
So how was your shower?

13:47.961 --> 13:48.929
It was a shower.

13:52.632 --> 13:53.901
What?

13:53.934 --> 13:57.905
This yellow spongy stuff,
do I eat it or did I eat it?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.876
It's squash, Dan.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.412
You really ought to be used to
eating all these healthy foods

14:05.445 --> 14:07.447
since you haven't been
eating anything else

14:07.480 --> 14:09.249
for the last two weeks, right?

14:09.282 --> 14:10.083
Yeah, well.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.622
You're not going
to do it, are you?

14:15.655 --> 14:17.958
What?

14:17.991 --> 14:20.427
Well, I found a candy
bar wrapper in your pants

14:20.460 --> 14:21.561
when I was doing the laundry.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.829
And it's still at
the lab but I'm

14:22.862 --> 14:24.231
pretty sure it's going to
come back with your prints

14:24.264 --> 14:25.065
all over it.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.969
I know about your fake walks.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.604
I even know about your burrito.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.074
I'm just not going to get mad.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.276
You're not?

14:36.309 --> 14:39.947
No, because I figure, you
know, you're just a human being

14:39.980 --> 14:42.182
and you're entitled to
a couple of mistakes.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.785
I just would like to put it all
behind us and start over again.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.620
OK?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.556
I got to tell you, I
didn't like sneaking around.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.827
I know all about
the temptation

14:54.861 --> 14:57.197
of the Three Musketeers, Dan.

14:57.230 --> 15:06.239
The creamy nugget, the smooth
milk chocolate, the dreams

15:06.273 --> 15:09.409
of becoming a swashbuckler.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.744
Well, doctor's orders
or not, I can't do it.

15:11.778 --> 15:12.645
It's hell.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.814
I mean, I can't live this way.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.550
I mean, I want my food
back, you know, real food?

15:17.584 --> 15:23.023
Dead animals, brightly colored
snacks, things on sticks.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.824
Yeah, well, I'm
not going to keep

15:24.857 --> 15:26.926
cooking those crap dinners
that got you in this mess

15:26.960 --> 15:28.228
in the first place, Dan.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.599
Well, what about the crap
breakfasts and crap lunches?

15:32.632 --> 15:35.268
Well, gee, Dan, if you
don't like my cooking,

15:35.302 --> 15:37.604
why don't you just
cook yourself?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.172
- Maybe I will.
- Oh yeah?

15:39.206 --> 15:40.073
Maybe you should.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.508
That will be fun to watch.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.575
Fine.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.745
You want me to fix
dinner, I'll fix dinner.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.480
I'm fixing dinner.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.717
Oh but honey, you just
fixed dinner 11 years ago.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.855
God, you're hiding food, Dan.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.424
Yeah, with the
cleaning products.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.958
It's the one place I
knew you'd never look.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.831
What was all that
crap you were telling me

16:04.864 --> 16:06.366
in the hospital, that
big speech about how

16:06.399 --> 16:08.001
you never cheated on me?

16:08.035 --> 16:09.402
What the hell do you call this?

16:09.436 --> 16:13.006
Look, I am sick and tired of
being treated like an invalid.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.507
So you're just going
to do it, aren't you?

16:14.541 --> 16:15.675
You're just going
to go right ahead

16:15.708 --> 16:19.079
and harden an artery
right here in my kitchen.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.880
I've got to live
a little, Roseanne.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.249
You won't let me eat anything.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.950
You won't let me take
any calls from work.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.852
Yeah, and I'm not going to
let you talk anymore either.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.355
So shut up.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.123
Just keep your
nose out of my work.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.591
It's none of your
business, Roseanne.

16:31.624 --> 16:36.396
I managed to get along just
fine without any of your help.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.999
Without any of my help?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.601
What the hell do you
think I was doing

16:41.634 --> 16:45.038
all those years at Welmans, and
Rodbells and the beauty parlor?

16:45.072 --> 16:46.139
And the diner?

16:46.173 --> 16:47.407
Do you think I was just
earning enough money

16:47.440 --> 16:49.076
to go out and buy new hats?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.311
If it wasn't for me,
the bank would have

16:51.344 --> 16:53.813
came and took this house
a long time ago, Dan.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.183
I always pulled in more
money than you brought in.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.784
Oh yeah?

16:57.817 --> 17:00.320
Well what about that year when
your bike shop went broke?

17:03.390 --> 17:04.324
Oh yeah, do it, Dan.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.458
You're going to show me.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.493
Oh, spread it on.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.794
Nothing in moderation, right?

17:07.827 --> 17:09.696
Oh, you got it, baby.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.999
Oh yeah, not for the
indestructible Dan Conner,

17:13.032 --> 17:16.403
drinker, biker, party
boy right from the '60s.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.538
If it feels good, do it.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.341
Or in your case, if it
tastes good, eat it.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.244
Watch it, Roseanne.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.879
You know what you are, Dan?

17:26.913 --> 17:31.084
You are a big fat guy with
absolutely no self control.

17:31.118 --> 17:35.222
You're Jerry Garcia
without the music.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.524
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, let's back up here.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.559
You're calling me fat?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.194
Yeah, I'm calling you fat.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.962
Well, if that ain't
the big, fat pot

17:42.995 --> 17:46.966
calling the kettle black.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.901
You better not
be calling me fat.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.370
Well, that's what I'm doing.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.404
- Fat, fat.
- Fat.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.372
- Fat.
- Fat.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.306
- Fat.
- Fat.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.274
- Fat.
- Fat.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.408
Fat.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.043
Well fine, if you don't
want the food I make,

17:57.076 --> 18:00.413
Dan, then we'll get rid of it.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.282
OK, and you know what?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.317
We don't need any more anymore
of this health food either.

18:04.351 --> 18:07.487
Get rid of all of this, too.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.988
I'm going to watch TV.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.590
Oh, of course you
are, Dan, because that's

18:10.623 --> 18:14.827
what you always do when anything
gets too damn real around here.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.095
I do not do that.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.464
Yes you do.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.233
You run to that TV and walk
away from me every single time

18:20.267 --> 18:21.401
there's a problem
in this family.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.002
Why the hell
shouldn't I walk away?

18:23.035 --> 18:25.004
You never let me do
squat around here.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.406
Problem with the kids?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.507
Hey, you'll handle it.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.210
Because I'd sure as
hell just screw it up.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.544
I watched these
kids grow up around

18:31.578 --> 18:32.745
here without ever
knowing what was

18:32.779 --> 18:35.047
going on or even who they were.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.983
Now just look at the
way they turned out.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.585
I think they turned out great.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.320
Oh please, Roseanne,
look at them.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.690
They're not exactly
the Kennedy kids.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.757
No, they're not.

18:44.791 --> 18:49.296
But their dad sure
drinks like Uncle Teddy.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.663
They're failures, Roseanne.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.098
And the only reason
you won't admit it

18:52.131 --> 18:55.134
is because you'll have to
admit you failed as a mother.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.904
The only way I
failed as a mother is

18:57.937 --> 18:59.906
to let Becky and Darlene
get married so young

18:59.939 --> 19:02.242
that they threw their
whole life away on a man.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.343
Just like I did.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.777
You didn't throw away a thing.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.745
Yes I did, Dan.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.714
I threw everything away.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.848
But all that's going to change.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.850
Because from now on,
I'm going to put all

19:10.883 --> 19:12.385
my energy into that TV show.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.286
That's fine.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.187
That's just great.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.622
Go.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.989
I'm going to show
my daughters that you

19:17.023 --> 19:19.992
don't have to give up your
dreams for some stupid guy.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.127
That's fine.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.463
Well, you just move to
Chicago for all I care.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.031
Then maybe your
damn family won't

19:25.064 --> 19:26.699
be hanging around
here all the time,

19:26.733 --> 19:28.501
give me some room for
my family to come.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.238
Hell, they can't even show
up for Thanksgiving anymore.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.005
Oh, so that's it, huh?

19:33.039 --> 19:36.376
It's my fault that you don't
have any kind of relationship

19:36.409 --> 19:37.710
with your family.

19:37.744 --> 19:41.047
God, you are pathetic.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.183
Did I ever stop you from
picking up that phone

19:44.217 --> 19:45.585
and calling your mother?

19:45.618 --> 19:49.656
Hey, at least I put my mother
in a psychiatric hospital

19:49.689 --> 19:51.324
where she can get
some help instead

19:51.358 --> 19:53.493
of letting her run around
the streets like yours,

19:53.526 --> 19:54.394
scaring people.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.868
Well, my mother might
be like fingernails

20:01.901 --> 20:04.103
on a chalkboard, Dan,
but at least she's

20:04.136 --> 20:07.840
allowed to grow fingernails.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.975
Oh, that's perfect.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.610
You've got an answer for
everything, don't you?

20:10.643 --> 20:11.978
Yeah, I do.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.013
Yeah, well, why don't you tell
me how to clean up this crap

20:14.046 --> 20:15.948
that you call decoration.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.620
OK, I will.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.256
I want you to pick them
all up using your ass.

20:23.290 --> 20:26.993
And start with
the pointy things.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.028
You are a controlling-- dah!

20:33.232 --> 20:34.767
No I'm not, Dan.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.403
I'm just trying
to do whatever it

20:36.436 --> 20:39.038
takes to get you to
get up off of your ass

20:39.071 --> 20:40.440
and stop staring at that--
[smash]

20:40.473 --> 20:41.274
damn TV.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.480
Boy, I tell you.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.648
I wish I had never ma--

20:53.453 --> 20:54.854
What?

20:54.887 --> 20:55.922
Say it.

20:55.955 --> 20:56.756
Nothing.

20:58.825 --> 20:59.826
Well, that makes two of us.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.264
You can die if you want to, Dan.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.300
But you're going to have to do
it alone because I'm not going

21:07.334 --> 21:08.668
to sit here and watch you.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.502
I'll be at Jackie's.

21:19.211 --> 21:23.049
