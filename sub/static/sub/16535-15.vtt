00:28.256 --> 00:30.724
Hey, boss. How's things?

00:30.726 --> 00:33.093
Well, if it isn't the invisible man.

00:33.095 --> 00:34.428
Yeah.

00:34.430 --> 00:37.097
Well, my undercover assignment,
it's wrapped.

00:37.099 --> 00:38.098
How was it?

00:38.100 --> 00:39.300
It was great.

00:39.302 --> 00:41.399
Yeah, I learned a lot.

00:41.537 --> 00:43.547
Glad to hear it.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.639
So now I'm back.

00:45.641 --> 00:47.007
All right, well, dig out your blues.

00:47.009 --> 00:48.676
Talk to Platt in the morning.

00:48.678 --> 00:50.778
Welcome back.

00:50.780 --> 00:52.680
You're knocking me back down to patrol?

00:52.682 --> 00:53.881
You know, actually, Adam,

00:53.883 --> 00:55.249
you were never assigned up here.

00:55.251 --> 00:57.651
You had the privilege to be detailed.

00:57.653 --> 00:58.752
All right.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.521
I mean, I feel like
I did good work up here.

01:00.523 --> 01:03.100
I had to find out from
the commander in Seven

01:03.125 --> 01:06.026
that you'd been detailed
to Detached Services.

01:06.028 --> 01:07.628
You left me one man short

01:07.630 --> 01:10.197
with a bunch of people asking me
questions I couldn't answer.

01:10.199 --> 01:11.632
Fair enough. I apologize for that.

01:11.634 --> 01:13.767
I do. It's just here's the thing.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.003
My ex-fiancÃ© was coming upstairs,

01:16.005 --> 01:17.738
so I freaked out a little bit.

01:17.740 --> 01:18.973
I needed to clear my head,

01:18.975 --> 01:19.974
which I did.

01:19.976 --> 01:21.942
So, boss, I mean,

01:21.944 --> 01:24.945
Intelligence, this is
where I want to be.

01:24.947 --> 01:29.149
I'll keep that in mind
if something opens up.

01:29.151 --> 01:32.252
All right, appreciate it, Sarge.

01:37.593 --> 01:40.461
Hey. I'm Rixton.

01:40.463 --> 01:42.029
Ruzek.

01:42.031 --> 01:44.098
- Listen, I... I didn't mean for...
- Hey, no sweat, man.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.200
Just keep doing the job.

02:00.916 --> 02:03.017
What's up, Scrap?

02:03.019 --> 02:05.653
Another day in paradise.

02:05.655 --> 02:07.755
I told him you got my tab.

02:07.757 --> 02:12.087
If it's worth me coming
all the way down here.

02:12.561 --> 02:15.896
Thank you.

02:15.898 --> 02:18.132
What's going on?

02:18.134 --> 02:19.833
There's a guy in town,

02:19.835 --> 02:22.636
looking to hire a hit man.

02:22.638 --> 02:25.072
How did you go from
boosting cases of liquor

02:25.074 --> 02:26.807
to being a triggerman?

02:26.809 --> 02:29.009
It was a friend of a friend
who was approached,

02:29.011 --> 02:32.798
and they reached out to me
to see if I know anyone.

02:34.517 --> 02:36.950
There are a lot of things that I can do,

02:36.952 --> 02:39.253
but pretending to be
a hit man is not one of them.

02:39.255 --> 02:40.988
So if I call
another detective down here,

02:40.990 --> 02:42.189
you better not be jerking me off.

02:42.191 --> 02:44.264
I'm telling you, Erin,

02:44.493 --> 02:46.405
it's for real.

02:59.775 --> 03:01.842
Al, this is Scrap.

03:01.844 --> 03:04.111
We've known each other
since we were kids.

03:04.113 --> 03:06.613
Am I hearing right, you got
a solicitation for murder?

03:06.615 --> 03:08.315
Yeah.

03:08.317 --> 03:12.419
But I need a promise from the PD first.

03:12.421 --> 03:15.189
My kid brother, Frankie,
he owes some guys money

03:15.191 --> 03:16.690
who you don't want to owe money to.

03:16.692 --> 03:18.759
He went south to pick up a car for them.

03:18.761 --> 03:21.495
He got popped, with
100 pounds of weed in the trunk.

03:21.497 --> 03:23.263
100 pounds?

03:23.265 --> 03:25.199
You said it was a little bit of weed.

03:25.201 --> 03:27.534
I'm offering you murder-for-hire.

03:27.536 --> 03:31.739
That's gotta trump any amount of weed.

03:31.741 --> 03:33.407
I'll give you this guy
who wants a hit man,

03:33.409 --> 03:35.576
but you got to get Frankie out of jail.

03:38.214 --> 03:41.682
Look who it is. It's him, the guy.

03:41.684 --> 03:44.284
Do we got a deal?

03:46.847 --> 03:48.622
Yeah.

03:51.427 --> 03:53.127
Yeah?

03:53.129 --> 03:56.964
Hey, that thing
we talked about, I got a guy.

03:56.966 --> 03:59.066
I'm with him right now.

04:03.706 --> 04:06.907
- First thing, no names.
- Okay.

04:06.909 --> 04:09.610
- Heard you need something done.
- Yeah. Yes.

04:09.612 --> 04:12.246
- Um, when can you...
- Not over the phone.

04:12.248 --> 04:14.348
I'll come to you.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.727
You guys got eyes?

04:26.729 --> 04:28.829
Flash 'em.

04:32.535 --> 04:34.635
Good.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.620
You,

04:53.622 --> 04:55.556
you said be holding two...
two cups, right?

04:55.558 --> 04:57.691
Yeah.

04:59.195 --> 05:01.328
I didn't know if
you like cream or sugar, so.

05:03.732 --> 05:06.222
So how does this work?

05:06.402 --> 05:08.802
We go to your room, talk details.

05:16.912 --> 05:18.879
Um, yeah, I'm not looking for that.

05:18.881 --> 05:19.947
I'm looking for a wire.

05:19.949 --> 05:21.648
Well, cops don't tape microphones

05:21.650 --> 05:23.884
to people's chests anymore.

05:25.454 --> 05:27.554
What do I call you?

05:27.556 --> 05:30.157
Pulaski.

05:30.159 --> 05:33.086
You have a daughter, Pulaski?

05:33.829 --> 05:35.072
No.

05:35.399 --> 05:37.063
I did.

05:45.107 --> 05:49.509
Two months ago, this
piece of garbage, Omar Fry,

05:49.511 --> 05:50.911
murdered her,

05:50.913 --> 05:52.517
and walked.

05:55.217 --> 05:56.783
She was only 22.

05:56.785 --> 05:59.993
Her life was just beginning.

06:04.894 --> 06:07.727
I'll pay you 50 grand to kill him.

06:31.606 --> 06:32.928
Rebecca Clark.

06:32.930 --> 06:33.996
That's the girl that moved here

06:33.998 --> 06:35.130
and was gunned down in Bronzeville

06:35.132 --> 06:36.398
a couple months back, right?

06:36.400 --> 06:37.833
That's right, she'd only been in Chicago

06:37.835 --> 06:39.549
six months before she got killed.

06:39.736 --> 06:41.803
Happened when she pulled over

06:41.805 --> 06:44.005
to buy a bottle of water
at a corner store.

06:44.007 --> 06:46.174
Shot with a .45 semi-auto.

06:46.176 --> 06:47.843
Father is Donald Clark.

06:47.845 --> 06:51.112
He is a poetry professor
at West Michigan College.

06:51.114 --> 06:53.048
Mother's in a mental institution.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.950
Checked herself in
after Rebecca's death.

06:54.952 --> 06:55.984
She couldn't handle it.

06:55.986 --> 06:57.652
So who's he want dead?

06:57.701 --> 06:59.501
Omar Fry.

06:59.656 --> 07:01.756
He's a documented South Ave hustler,

07:01.758 --> 07:03.458
prime suspect in Rebecca's murder.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.505
Gang Intelligence and
Area Central Homicide

07:05.530 --> 07:07.639
both cleared him, so he
was released a few weeks ago.

07:07.664 --> 07:09.330
Since then, open murder investigation,

07:09.332 --> 07:10.398
no other suspects.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.599
Now, Clark is convinced

07:11.601 --> 07:13.468
that Omar Fry's the guy
who killed his daughter.

07:13.470 --> 07:15.637
All right, Jay, you
and Atwater hit Homan Square.

07:15.639 --> 07:17.672
See if you can dig up
the original gang file.

07:17.697 --> 07:20.619
Kenny, you and Burgess
go pay Omar Fry a visit.

07:20.644 --> 07:23.077
What's the next step with Clark?

07:23.079 --> 07:24.263
Let's see if we can get some perspective

07:24.287 --> 07:25.680
on the original homicide first,

07:25.682 --> 07:27.815
shed some light on who
actually killed his daughter.

07:27.817 --> 07:30.372
For now, just...
just string Clark along.

07:30.397 --> 07:33.146
Yo, Sarge, I heard Ruzek's back.

07:33.623 --> 07:35.690
Yeah, he's back at 21, yeah,

07:35.692 --> 07:37.969
but he's not back up here.

07:37.994 --> 07:40.061
Copy that.

07:48.538 --> 07:50.704
Good morning, Sergeant.

07:50.706 --> 07:51.806
Hey, Erin.

07:51.808 --> 07:53.574
So I have a CI,

07:53.576 --> 07:56.010
put us onto a major felony.

07:56.012 --> 07:59.013
In exchange, I need to get
his brother out of Cook County.

07:59.015 --> 08:02.650
Well, you know, I'd love to help
but there's more steps than this.

08:02.652 --> 08:05.152
Especially since it's
a snitch's relative

08:05.154 --> 08:06.384
and not the actually snitch.

08:06.409 --> 08:08.265
Come on, Sergeant, I made a promise.

08:08.290 --> 08:10.057
I made a promise too, Detective.

08:10.059 --> 08:13.127
I promised to truly serve
our sovereign county and state

08:13.129 --> 08:16.862
as a police officer
without favor, affection,

08:16.887 --> 08:18.857
malice, or ill will!

08:27.171 --> 08:28.437
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:28.979 --> 08:31.424
What's up?

08:31.647 --> 08:35.566
So I, had a PI friend
look into Rebecca's case.

08:35.660 --> 08:38.481
Omar Fry, he was cleared on all charges.

08:38.506 --> 08:40.787
You... you do know that, right?

08:40.789 --> 08:42.087
Yeah, that's what the detective said.

08:42.090 --> 08:43.690
You know, with the murder rate
here, what the hell

08:43.692 --> 08:45.592
do Chicago cops know, right?

08:45.594 --> 08:46.793
All right.

08:46.795 --> 08:48.495
But now if it turns out that

08:48.497 --> 08:50.430
this Fry isn't the guy,

08:50.973 --> 08:53.762
you know, you don't get a refund?

08:55.137 --> 08:57.662
I know in my heart he did it.

08:59.007 --> 09:01.942
All right, I'm gonna need,
10% up front

09:01.967 --> 09:03.921
for a new barrel and a set of wheels.

09:03.946 --> 09:06.724
You know, you already have a gun.
Why can't you just get this over with?

09:06.748 --> 09:09.182
Listen, you want this
not be traced back to us?

09:09.184 --> 09:10.423
I'm gonna need an untraceable gun,

09:10.447 --> 09:12.275
and I'm not gonna pull up
in my own personal vehicle

09:12.299 --> 09:14.120
to do this, all right?

09:14.122 --> 09:15.342
Look, it's your job, it's fine.

09:15.366 --> 09:17.399
That's 5,000. I think I've got it.

09:25.248 --> 09:27.315
Yeah.

09:29.871 --> 09:32.984
All right, so, just so
we understand each other,

09:33.341 --> 09:35.070
once you start this,

09:35.277 --> 09:37.507
there's no turning back.

09:38.601 --> 09:41.547
Just bring my little girl some justice.

09:47.488 --> 09:48.722
You guys got your work cut out for you,

09:48.746 --> 09:50.923
dealing with all these cliques?

09:50.925 --> 09:52.091
So what do you got for us?

09:52.293 --> 09:54.660
Rebecca's murder wasn't a typical

09:54.685 --> 09:56.065
"mutual combatant" killing.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.963
It was an innocent girl new to the city.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.966
So the mayor's office gave us a
directive to saturate the area.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.935
And you guys like Omar Fry for it?

10:03.237 --> 10:06.109
Well, we did at first.
He's a banger with a ton of priors.

10:06.134 --> 10:07.906
He was recorded on a security camera

10:07.908 --> 10:09.968
at a corner store buying a tallboy,

10:09.993 --> 10:11.675
where Rebecca had purchased
a bottle of water

10:11.699 --> 10:13.045
approximately a minute later.

10:13.147 --> 10:15.047
We assumed he followed her to her car

10:15.049 --> 10:16.748
and it was a robbery gone sideways.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.684
So now you cleared Omar?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.385
Yeah, we never found a murder weapon.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.321
He passed the gun residue test.

10:22.323 --> 10:23.622
We got no confession.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.306
Have we given Rebecca's dad
this information?

10:25.330 --> 10:27.125
He's in town now,
asking a lot of questions.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.061
Yeah, he showed up
after Omar got released.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.430
Almost had him arrested,
he was so worked up.

10:31.432 --> 10:33.610
Even when I showed him the
evidence, he wouldn't listen.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.334
We don't want to step on any toes.
You mind if we take a stab at it?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.270
Stab away.

10:38.272 --> 10:40.372
I got ten cases here that
I haven't even read yet.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.045
Thank you.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.283
I got a medical card
around here somewhere.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.651
Wanna see it?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.053
Save it. We're not here for that.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.810
After what you all put me through,

10:57.835 --> 10:59.501
accusing me of shooting that girl,

10:59.881 --> 11:02.060
doctor said I got PTSD.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.612
Only thing that cures it is the kush.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.800
Omar, we have to ask you
about that case.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.902
Been there, done that.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.158
I spent two weeks down at 26th and Cal,

11:13.183 --> 11:14.777
ducking shanks and
eating bologna sandwiches

11:14.801 --> 11:15.974
for something I didn't do.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.909
Daddy, who are they?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.811
Just some police officers, baby,

11:20.066 --> 11:21.903
making sure we all right around here.

11:22.051 --> 11:24.182
Go back and read your books.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.537
You know, only pimps
still carry money clips.

11:33.470 --> 11:35.636
So any idea who
might have killed Rebecca?

11:35.661 --> 11:37.461
I'm supposed to help you guys now?

11:37.463 --> 11:39.265
Just take the money.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.932
Buy your kid some new books.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.769
The gang detectives,

11:45.771 --> 11:47.538
I didn't like how they disrespected me.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.973
So there's something I didn't tell 'em.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.875
I walked out of that corner store,

11:50.877 --> 11:52.443
sipping my beer.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.479
I'm halfway down the block
when I hear this pop-pop-pop.

11:55.641 --> 11:57.708
'Course I knew it was
something going off,

11:57.710 --> 11:58.676
so I looked back.

11:58.678 --> 11:59.677
You saw who did it?

11:59.679 --> 12:00.778
Nah.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.413
But I saw this dude in a shiny hoodie

12:02.415 --> 12:03.685
run to the other side of the street

12:03.709 --> 12:05.449
and duck into the Red Line tunnel.

12:05.451 --> 12:07.151
The one on 47th and Wentworth?

12:07.153 --> 12:08.686
Running like he was just shooting.

12:08.871 --> 12:11.255
And I know what that looks like.

12:13.724 --> 12:17.234
All right, search the drainage grates
along all the stairwells.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.218
Bangers file the gates loose,

12:19.243 --> 12:20.695
use them to hide contraband.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.687
They get spotted topside, come down here

12:22.712 --> 12:24.342
to sling away their guns or drugs.

12:24.367 --> 12:26.431
I suggest you all split up.

12:37.994 --> 12:39.381
I got three pennies

12:39.406 --> 12:41.973
and half a dozen cigarette butts.

12:41.998 --> 12:46.294
Well, I got a used condom
and four rat-sized roaches.

12:46.319 --> 12:48.469
So don't complain.

12:48.471 --> 12:49.570
Yeah.

12:54.743 --> 12:56.713
I ran into Ruzek last night.

12:57.079 --> 12:58.611
Yeah?

12:58.781 --> 13:00.744
He came looking for his desk.

13:01.851 --> 13:03.784
Just curious, where
do you stand on that?

13:03.786 --> 13:06.197
Him coming back?

13:06.956 --> 13:09.959
I don't know, it sounds like Voight just
shut the door on that, so.

13:09.984 --> 13:12.054
Well, yeah, but...

13:12.361 --> 13:14.758
where do you stand on it?

13:17.025 --> 13:18.325
You've been great, Kenny.

13:18.414 --> 13:20.008
A real asset.

13:22.904 --> 13:25.457
Bob Ruzek, that's...

13:25.874 --> 13:27.741
that's his old man, right?

13:27.743 --> 13:30.223
Yeah. Why?

13:32.463 --> 13:34.356
Just asking.

13:38.954 --> 13:41.221
When I was stationed
in Kabul, I lost a bet,

13:41.223 --> 13:44.357
and I had to cover up the latrines
with a shovel for like a month.

13:46.094 --> 13:48.671
And I would take this over that any day.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.386
Hold up.

13:52.534 --> 13:54.800
Check this out.

13:55.352 --> 13:57.972
What is that?

14:04.946 --> 14:07.247
I think we have a murder weapon.

14:12.937 --> 14:15.138
Had the lab rush the test on our gun.

14:15.140 --> 14:16.807
The ballistics are 100% match

14:16.809 --> 14:18.909
to the rounds they pulled
out of Rebecca Clark's body.

14:18.911 --> 14:20.244
Any prints or DNA?

14:20.246 --> 14:22.145
- Nothing usable.
- But we may not need them.

14:22.147 --> 14:23.557
I ran the gun through the CAGE unit

14:23.582 --> 14:26.083
and it came back registered
to a Thomas Kade.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.958
Turns out he has been on CPD's radar

14:27.960 --> 14:29.459
the last few weeks, identified as

14:29.461 --> 14:31.795
"a person of interest"
in illegal gun sales.

14:31.797 --> 14:33.530
Yeah, but what's
his connection to Rebecca?

14:33.555 --> 14:35.342
We're still working on that part.

14:35.403 --> 14:37.603
Kade has a fake Federal Firearms License

14:37.605 --> 14:38.838
and he's a known straw buyer.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.550
So he's probably not our shooter.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.686
More likely, he sold the gun
to whoever killed Rebecca.

14:42.710 --> 14:43.755
You got an address?

14:43.780 --> 14:45.671
Yeah, it's a business

14:45.696 --> 14:48.314
called Smoke Bliss on 44th and Calumet.

14:48.316 --> 14:50.335
Wait, the head shop?

14:51.247 --> 14:52.880
I drive by it on my way to work.

14:52.905 --> 14:54.302
Let's go have a look.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.210
Hey, Hank, I got to be honest.

14:56.524 --> 14:58.123
Something's not equating with me.

14:59.054 --> 15:00.349
What's that?

15:00.861 --> 15:03.724
Well, Donald Clark.

15:04.632 --> 15:06.591
Why don't we let him loose?

15:07.134 --> 15:09.560
He solicited a murder, Al.

15:10.004 --> 15:12.456
Not like we haven't done worse.

15:13.471 --> 15:15.213
You know, for our kids.

15:16.974 --> 15:19.041
Let's see how it plays out.

15:26.887 --> 15:28.654
C-can I help you guys?

15:28.656 --> 15:30.276
Thomas Kade.

15:31.392 --> 15:33.261
Where is he?

15:33.727 --> 15:35.534
I don't know who you're talking about.

15:40.467 --> 15:42.567
He's not here! He's not here!

15:42.569 --> 15:44.236
He just comes in once in a while

15:44.238 --> 15:45.504
to do business!

15:45.506 --> 15:46.938
Which business?

15:46.940 --> 15:48.874
Weed or guns?

15:49.063 --> 15:51.390
I don't ask any questions, man.

15:51.632 --> 15:53.828
I just run the shop!

15:54.201 --> 15:56.268
Take it off the hinges.

16:12.163 --> 16:13.929
Hey.

16:23.730 --> 16:24.796
Wow.

16:24.798 --> 16:26.973
Either you tell me where Kade is,

16:27.191 --> 16:29.868
or I'm thinking these are your guns.

16:33.407 --> 16:35.440
CPD, hands in the air!
Let me see your hands!

16:35.442 --> 16:36.775
- Go up there! Go up there!
- Go on, hands up!

16:36.777 --> 16:37.776
Yo, I'm gonna need two upstairs!

16:37.778 --> 16:38.977
- Hands up!
- Don't move!

16:38.979 --> 16:40.278
Hey, seize these weapons.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.329
Thomas Kade.
We're looking for Thomas Kade.

16:42.354 --> 16:44.682
Where's he at? Where's he at?

16:44.707 --> 16:46.751
- Coming down. Atwater, on me.
- I got you.

16:53.226 --> 16:54.993
Unh!

17:00.600 --> 17:02.667
Yeah!

17:06.772 --> 17:08.673
Nice and slow, drop your weapons.

17:08.675 --> 17:10.107
- Everybody get your hands up!
- Drop your guns!

17:10.131 --> 17:11.375
Hands up on your head
and get down on your knees.

17:11.377 --> 17:12.710
Drop it, come on. Come on.

17:12.712 --> 17:15.046
Yo, I ain't kneeling
for nobody in my own home.

17:15.048 --> 17:17.214
What, are you gonna shoot me?
I'm not armed.

17:21.057 --> 17:22.289
Put your hands behind your back.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.020
- Put your hands behind your back!
- Get off me, man! Come on.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.550
- You got them?
- I got 'em.

17:25.576 --> 17:27.435
Don't move.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.799
What's up with Frankie?

17:32.801 --> 17:34.768
Why's he not been sprung yet?

17:34.770 --> 17:36.703
I told you I'm working on it.

17:36.705 --> 17:38.071
Well, work harder.

17:38.073 --> 17:40.107
My brother don't
deserve to be locked up.

17:40.179 --> 17:43.113
Dude, I don't just
snap my fingers and he's out.

17:43.115 --> 17:44.981
There's a process to this.

17:44.983 --> 17:46.616
When I got news, I'll call you.

17:46.618 --> 17:47.951
Call me?

17:47.953 --> 17:49.486
How about I call
this Donald cat right now,

17:49.488 --> 17:50.821
tell him it's all a setup?

17:51.023 --> 17:53.023
Tell him he's meeting
with an undercover cop?

17:53.025 --> 17:55.225
Go home, Scrap. I'll be in touch.

17:55.227 --> 18:00.205
Nah, I think I'll call him right now.

18:01.033 --> 18:02.699
You want to be stupid?

18:02.701 --> 18:03.867
Turn around.

18:03.869 --> 18:04.868
For what?

18:04.870 --> 18:05.969
You're under arrest.

18:05.971 --> 18:07.137
Turn around.

18:08.648 --> 18:10.214
What am I under arrest for?

18:10.216 --> 18:13.124
For having a big mouth.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.597
Hey, those crates of guns

18:15.622 --> 18:17.374
we found in the back of
Smoke Bliss, they came back

18:17.398 --> 18:19.295
seized from the ATF in multiple states.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.585
They were stolen from a melt-down truck

18:20.609 --> 18:22.260
on their way to be destroyed in Indiana.

18:22.262 --> 18:24.295
So this guy, Kade, ripped off a load

18:24.297 --> 18:26.063
of seized guns from the ATF?

18:26.065 --> 18:28.072
And then he got himself
a fake Firearms License

18:28.097 --> 18:29.097
and started selling them?

18:29.122 --> 18:31.489
I know, Sarge, something doesn't add up.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.606
Rebecca Clark.

18:35.608 --> 18:36.774
Never heard of her.

18:36.776 --> 18:37.909
Yeah?

18:37.911 --> 18:39.739
Well, one of your guns
was used in her murder,

18:39.764 --> 18:41.936
so either you shot her yourself

18:42.124 --> 18:44.225
or you sold that to her killer.

18:44.450 --> 18:45.549
I know people.

18:45.551 --> 18:47.318
I'll never do a day in jail.

18:47.504 --> 18:48.670
He knows people.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.559
In that case, we should let him go.

18:50.584 --> 18:51.956
Yeah.

18:55.728 --> 18:57.194
Who'd you sell the guns to?

18:57.196 --> 18:58.429
I like this kind of party.

18:58.431 --> 18:59.997
Yeah? Then let's go all night.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.487
- Hank? Hank?
- Sarge. Sarge!

19:03.602 --> 19:06.643
This is Group Supervisor
Greg Hammet from the ATF.

19:07.198 --> 19:08.772
You need to release him right now.

19:08.774 --> 19:10.252
You gotta be kidding me.
This is our offender.

19:10.276 --> 19:11.408
He's not going anywhere.

19:11.410 --> 19:12.785
Well, he's an undercover federal agent,

19:12.809 --> 19:15.167
so it's best you uncuff him.

19:15.276 --> 19:16.743
Told you.

19:16.816 --> 19:18.667
I know people.

19:22.021 --> 19:24.545
All right, back up a second.

19:24.996 --> 19:26.462
So what is this operation?

19:26.561 --> 19:28.869
Overload.
It was initiated last September.

19:28.894 --> 19:31.428
We got over 1,000 hours of
manpower on this case so far.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.663
So I understand,

19:32.665 --> 19:34.798
the ATF didn't deconflict this operation

19:34.800 --> 19:36.566
with CPD or any other agency?

19:36.568 --> 19:38.301
No-no-no, it's classified deep cover.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.569
No offense, look, guys,

19:39.571 --> 19:41.672
as soon as we tell local PD, we,

19:41.674 --> 19:43.073
we know it's burned.

19:43.075 --> 19:45.342
I've seen the G do some crazy stings,

19:45.344 --> 19:48.078
but intentionally putting guns in the
hands of criminals? That's a new one.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.680
Yeah, man, I was just
getting into character.

19:49.683 --> 19:51.403
You know how undercover works,
you gotta sell it.

19:51.427 --> 19:53.627
All right, guys, look,
we surveil all activities.

19:53.652 --> 19:55.452
You understand, any guns sold

19:55.454 --> 19:57.120
were tracked by their serial numbers.

19:57.122 --> 19:58.891
Arrests were made
if they were used in a crime,

19:58.915 --> 20:01.749
taking major offenders
off of your streets.

20:01.793 --> 20:05.028
One of your guns was used to kill
an innocent 22-year-old girl, so exactly

20:05.030 --> 20:06.650
how many firearms
have you lost track of?

20:06.675 --> 20:07.986
No, we don't lose track of anything.

20:08.010 --> 20:09.041
Then you should be able to tell us where

20:09.065 --> 20:10.667
we found the .45
that killed Rebecca Clark.

20:10.669 --> 20:13.370
All right, look, look,
is any operation 100% ironclad?

20:13.372 --> 20:15.832
You know, maybe a few guns
fell through the cracks,

20:15.857 --> 20:19.255
we lost track, but we have made
over 80 felony arrests so far.

20:19.981 --> 20:21.661
What's important here is the victim.

20:21.663 --> 20:22.895
We're in agreement on that same page.

20:22.897 --> 20:23.996
So what can we do to help?

20:23.998 --> 20:26.599
I need the reports
on everyone you sold guns to

20:26.601 --> 20:28.601
and every piece of surveillance you got.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.346
So you're gonna jeopardize
our whole operation?

20:30.370 --> 20:31.871
Your operation is jeopardized.

20:31.873 --> 20:33.691
You're through in my city.

20:33.878 --> 20:35.652
I mean, you got a problem with that?

20:35.743 --> 20:37.476
Just ask around about Hank Voight.

20:37.478 --> 20:39.338
Yeah, we already did.

20:40.491 --> 20:41.857
Listen, you can have the files.

20:42.048 --> 20:43.690
Just,

20:43.973 --> 20:46.385
preserve the work we've done here.

20:58.294 --> 20:59.988
Hey, Sarge.

20:59.989 --> 21:01.222
Hey.

21:01.224 --> 21:02.824
Looks like I'm working
down here for a while.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.604
Actually,
Commander Crowley wants you

21:04.629 --> 21:06.527
to report to the 27th District.

21:06.529 --> 21:08.963
They need bodies for their third shifts.

21:08.965 --> 21:10.665
The graveyard shift.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.767
- Are you being serious right now?
- It's what's open.

21:12.769 --> 21:13.768
Wha...

21:13.770 --> 21:14.869
Graveyard shift.

21:14.871 --> 21:15.937
Come here.

21:15.939 --> 21:18.324
Come over here, come on.

21:21.244 --> 21:22.543
Look, you did the right thing.

21:22.545 --> 21:24.645
You were uncomfortable
with the situation,

21:24.647 --> 21:26.547
so you removed yourself from it.

21:26.549 --> 21:27.951
All right, well,
if I did the right thing,

21:27.975 --> 21:29.499
then why am I getting punished for it?

21:29.524 --> 21:31.085
Because that's life, Adam.

21:31.087 --> 21:32.253
So you know what you do?

21:32.255 --> 21:34.358
You put your head down, you do the job,

21:34.383 --> 21:36.991
and you work your way back,
one shift at a time.

21:37.277 --> 21:40.035
My God, I just gave myself
goose bumps. Feel that.

21:41.596 --> 21:43.463
Yeah. All right.

21:43.728 --> 21:44.898
27th District?

21:44.900 --> 21:46.467
Like I said, one shift at a time.

21:46.469 --> 21:47.468
Go on.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.580
Thanks, Sarge.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.425
My, PI guy,

21:55.945 --> 21:58.679
he says it might not be Fry after all.

21:59.229 --> 22:02.636
So I came by to ask you one last time.

22:04.069 --> 22:05.749
You sure you want to do this?

22:10.152 --> 22:11.785
You know, I was...

22:12.116 --> 22:14.923
I was just thinking about Rebecca.

22:16.329 --> 22:19.299
This one time, she broke her leg.

22:19.301 --> 22:21.032
We were camping.

22:21.238 --> 22:24.606
And I had to carry her

22:24.727 --> 22:26.550
into town in my arms.

22:26.575 --> 22:29.342
And she was crying, you know?
I felt helpless.

22:29.344 --> 22:31.940
I felt...

22:33.949 --> 22:36.913
It's a feeling you'd only understand

22:36.938 --> 22:39.163
if you had kids, but...

22:48.964 --> 22:51.998
Hey, man, if you
ever want to call if off,

22:52.000 --> 22:53.399
we can.

22:53.401 --> 22:55.319
I mean, I already spent
the up front money,

22:55.344 --> 22:57.737
but you keep the rest and you
pretend that we never met.

22:57.762 --> 23:00.248
No, I mean, I... I've come this far.

23:00.541 --> 23:02.942
I don't know. Give me a night, okay?

23:02.944 --> 23:05.159
I, I'll be in touch with you.

23:11.751 --> 23:14.518
All right, the ATF supplied us
with all their UC reports,

23:14.520 --> 23:16.987
including listings of
all the weapons and individuals

23:16.989 --> 23:19.590
that they sold to, including
photos and video surveillance

23:19.592 --> 23:21.329
of every purchase.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.769
Now, this is Maxwell Clay,

23:24.978 --> 23:26.884
AKA Gold Fish.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.045
This guy has priors for
gun and narcotics possession.

23:30.070 --> 23:32.749
And three months ago, he bought
a batch of over 20 guns

23:32.774 --> 23:35.685
from Agent Tucker, including the .45
that was used to kill Rebecca Clark.

23:35.687 --> 23:37.536
This guy preparing for war?

23:37.561 --> 23:38.955
Well, he's his own mini-straw buyer,

23:38.957 --> 23:41.157
so he buys the guns from Tucker
and sells them out of his bar.

23:41.159 --> 23:43.542
Gold Fish is definitely the worst
street name I've ever heard.

23:43.566 --> 23:44.954
I knew a guy named Poodlehead.

23:44.979 --> 23:47.197
Poodlehead, that's definitely
the worst street name I've ever heard.

23:47.221 --> 23:49.907
Okay, Gold Fish runs a dive in Kenwood.

23:49.932 --> 23:51.932
All right, let's go snatch his ass up.

23:51.934 --> 23:53.934
Your car got downed by the Area.

23:53.936 --> 23:56.636
They're switching out
some of the old 1505 cars.

23:56.638 --> 23:58.204
What do we get to replace it?

23:58.229 --> 23:59.533
GMC Sierra,

23:59.697 --> 24:01.587
brand-new.

24:01.944 --> 24:03.470
Um.

24:03.612 --> 24:05.642
Please, can we talk?

24:06.482 --> 24:10.128
Okay, this is my dream rig.

24:10.518 --> 24:13.846
You know this, I've probably
mentioned it in my sleep.

24:14.478 --> 24:18.126
Now, I've rode shotgun since day one,

24:18.179 --> 24:20.126
with no complaint.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.109
It's time you drove, grasshopper.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.283
You're my angel.

24:33.226 --> 24:35.319
- Chicago PD!
- Don't even think about it.

24:35.344 --> 24:37.277
- Everybody, get up.
- Outside, now.

24:37.279 --> 24:39.231
- Let's go.
- Hands where we can see 'em.

24:39.954 --> 24:40.954
Ooh.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.967
That's nice.

24:42.992 --> 24:44.792
Yeah. Leave it there.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.350
Hands up.

24:46.352 --> 24:47.651
Higher.

24:47.653 --> 24:48.886
This better be good.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.787
I got all my permits
up to date with the city.

24:50.789 --> 24:53.357
Yeah, well, we're
here about guns, Goldy.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.025
Man, I just sling drinks.

24:56.295 --> 24:58.326
Whoa.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.667
What, like a nine millimeter
with a .380 chaser?

25:01.692 --> 25:02.676
Oops.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.674
Remember this?

25:05.237 --> 25:07.337
That's you and Thomas Kade.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.339
You're buying 23 guns.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.945
Well, guess what.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.956
Kade is an ATF agent.

25:13.354 --> 25:15.148
You telling me that
gacked-out white boy was a cop?

25:15.172 --> 25:16.264
That's right.

25:16.289 --> 25:17.606
And one of the guns you sold

25:17.608 --> 25:19.608
was used to murder this young woman,

25:19.610 --> 25:21.255
Rebecca Clark.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.778
Everybody wants a strap.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.580
So I sell them on the side
for a little bit of cash,

25:24.582 --> 25:26.282
but I ain't never shot
at nobody in my life.

25:26.284 --> 25:29.091
All right. Then who'd you sell it to?

25:29.740 --> 25:31.539
A .45 Taurus.

25:31.732 --> 25:32.957
You better think hard

25:32.982 --> 25:34.756
or you're gonna be
charged with that murder.

25:34.758 --> 25:36.458
Look, I'm not gonna waste your time.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.393
Yeah, I bought the hardware.

25:38.395 --> 25:40.888
I sold the .45 to my cousin, Big O.

25:41.075 --> 25:43.309
We're gonna need a real name
and address.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.752
He's dead.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.411
Sold him a piece 'cause he said
he was feeling heat on his block.

25:47.436 --> 25:49.336
A week later, they shot him off of 51st.

25:49.338 --> 25:50.904
- Who is they?
- I don't know.

25:50.906 --> 25:53.239
Some Latin Player he was beefing with.

25:53.241 --> 25:54.641
But you know how that go.

25:54.643 --> 25:56.009
No one saw nothing.

25:56.011 --> 25:57.110
Hey, what happened to the gun?

25:57.112 --> 25:58.144
I never found it.

25:58.146 --> 25:59.879
Picked it off his body
after they shot him.

25:59.881 --> 26:01.081
All right, bring him in.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.349
Check his story.

26:02.351 --> 26:04.651
And write him up for every
single one of those weapons.

26:04.676 --> 26:07.442
Think I get this Gold Fish thing now.

26:10.959 --> 26:13.025
Hey, you got State's Attorney Jefferies

26:13.027 --> 26:15.214
in your office looking for you.

26:15.391 --> 26:17.458
And he's looking for you too.

26:22.670 --> 26:25.138
So where are we with this
murder-for-hire case, Sergeant?

26:25.140 --> 26:27.065
Donald Clark, yeah, well, we're just

26:27.252 --> 26:29.151
keeping him on the hook
for now until we can

26:29.354 --> 26:32.078
shed some more light on who
actually killed his daughter.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.613
I'm confused.

26:33.874 --> 26:35.373
Well, we traced the murder weapon

26:35.375 --> 26:36.674
back to the guy who bought it.

26:36.676 --> 26:38.610
Turns out that he was killed

26:38.612 --> 26:40.233
two weeks before Rebecca Clark,

26:40.258 --> 26:42.680
so we're back to
square one on our murder.

26:42.682 --> 26:44.249
These are two stand-alone cases.

26:44.251 --> 26:45.850
Totally independent.

26:45.994 --> 26:47.885
If you solve her killing? Great.

26:47.887 --> 26:49.687
But this man came to Chicago,

26:49.689 --> 26:52.023
with the express purpose
to hire a hit man

26:52.025 --> 26:53.624
and pay for a murder, correct?

26:53.626 --> 26:54.908
He put a hit on the wrong guy.

26:54.933 --> 26:57.462
He could have targeted
Bozo the Clown for all I care.

26:57.464 --> 26:58.978
You don't think we're obligated to

26:59.003 --> 27:00.231
find the actual shooter?

27:00.233 --> 27:02.333
After you have Donald Clark in custody.

27:02.335 --> 27:05.181
Listen, the guy, he's not a criminal.

27:05.206 --> 27:07.276
Because he's a white poetry professor?

27:07.301 --> 27:08.740
No, it's not that.

27:08.742 --> 27:10.341
He's a grieving father.

27:10.343 --> 27:12.210
Let me ask you this.

27:12.212 --> 27:14.465
If it was a black man
put a hit on a white kid,

27:14.490 --> 27:15.910
would you still feel the same way?

27:15.935 --> 27:17.602
Come on, man.

27:17.692 --> 27:19.474
You got some balls asking me that.

27:19.559 --> 27:21.238
You didn't answer my question.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.315
You know, next month I've been
on this job, what, 28 years?

27:24.340 --> 27:25.957
And not once did I ever arrest somebody

27:25.982 --> 27:27.863
based on race.

27:28.044 --> 27:29.592
I mean, there's the law,

27:29.712 --> 27:31.170
and then there's doing the right thing.

27:31.194 --> 27:33.314
Hey, no one said Clark is gonna walk.

27:33.316 --> 27:36.311
I don't care about right and wrong.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.927
Finish the sting. Bring Donald Clark in.

27:40.062 --> 27:42.489
Or we're gonna have a problem.

27:51.634 --> 27:53.111
All right, get Omar Fry down here.

27:53.136 --> 27:55.670
Set up a fake hit that
you can show Donald Clark.

27:55.980 --> 27:58.572
Get him on tape giving you
the rest of the money.

27:58.597 --> 28:00.486
Listen, Hank, I think
I got through to Clark.

28:00.511 --> 28:02.626
- I think he might back out of this thing.
- Al.

28:03.947 --> 28:05.446
Set it up.

28:17.832 --> 28:19.840
Remember the Family Secrets sting?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.365
When I had to cover you in, what,

28:21.367 --> 28:23.033
two gallons of pigs blood over you

28:23.035 --> 28:25.993
because you were supposed
to be stabbed to death?

28:26.140 --> 28:27.739
Hey, so

28:27.773 --> 28:29.740
did Detective Lindsay
explain everything to you?

28:29.742 --> 28:31.909
Yeah, I'm supposed to get
dolled up like I'm dead,

28:31.911 --> 28:33.477
and you're gonna take pictures.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.045
But I ain't agreed to nothing yet.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.914
Hey, it only takes 30 minutes.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.916
I give you an execution-style makeover,

28:38.918 --> 28:40.517
you lay down,
close your eyes for a minute,

28:40.519 --> 28:41.585
and I take a few shots.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.187
I don't gotta do nothing for free.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.723
Especially after the police
almost ruined my life.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.257
So I hear you got a little girl.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.759
Isn't she gonna be proud
when you tell her

28:48.761 --> 28:50.094
you helped the CPD?

28:50.096 --> 28:52.329
Think you're tugging
on my heart strings?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.864
Two G,

28:53.866 --> 28:56.667
or y'all can find
somebody else to play dead.

28:56.669 --> 28:58.035
All right, go sign out

28:58.037 --> 29:01.171
two dimes from the 1505 fund.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.076
Listen, Al, I...

29:06.078 --> 29:07.611
I know how you feel about Rebecca's dad.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.046
I don't want to hear this.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.148
Just go get the money.

29:18.724 --> 29:21.959
So the .45 we picked off
Gold Fish's cousin, Big O,

29:21.961 --> 29:24.795
he says it was gang related,
apparently some Latin Player.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.197
So we had CPIC and Gang Investigations

29:27.199 --> 29:28.999
pull the cards of all known gang members

29:29.001 --> 29:30.200
in the Bronzeville area.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.335
It's a dead end on Big O.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.336
They couldn't find any player

29:32.338 --> 29:34.238
who was a documented enemy of his.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.440
But they did tell us
that the 54th Street Gangsters

29:36.442 --> 29:39.009
and the Latin Players have been
at each other's throats lately.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.978
So we took a closer look

29:40.980 --> 29:43.380
and found something interesting.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.049
Jeremy Reynolds.

29:45.051 --> 29:48.519
26, multiple gang cards,
arrested a dozen times.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.554
He was a hardcore 54th Street G.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.489
- "Was"?
- Yeah, until about a year ago.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.691
Then he became inactive.

29:53.693 --> 29:56.293
He got a civilian job
at Pioneer Machining.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.561
Guess where that's located.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.730
Ten miles north in Logan Square.

29:59.732 --> 30:01.398
Which is right across
the street from Grainger,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.300
which is where Rebecca Clark worked

30:03.302 --> 30:05.202
as a clerk in Shipping and Receiving.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.838
Well, I mean, we know the
Players and the 54th Street G's

30:07.840 --> 30:09.973
do have a pretty long history
of gang warfare.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.342
How Rebecca Clark got involved,
I have no idea, but

30:12.344 --> 30:13.944
this could be a retaliation hit, Sarge.

30:13.946 --> 30:16.880
Yeah, well, why don't you
start by asking him?

30:23.856 --> 30:25.956
Hey, excuse me, we need to ask
you some questions, Jeremy.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.324
About what?

30:27.326 --> 30:30.094
About her. You know her?

30:30.096 --> 30:31.228
I'd say that's a yes.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.463
Let's clock him out for the day.

30:32.465 --> 30:34.565
Yeah, come on, let's go.

30:36.569 --> 30:41.405
You know what a nexus is, Jeremy?

30:41.407 --> 30:45.409
It's just a $10 word meaning connection.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.978
Like how you're connected
to Rebecca Clark,

30:47.980 --> 30:50.481
or, more to the point,

30:50.483 --> 30:51.515
to her homicide.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.683
I didn't kill her.

30:52.685 --> 30:54.785
But you admit you did know her, right?

30:54.787 --> 30:55.819
We met on a lunch break.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.955
Where we worked, it's all industrial.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.090
Everyone goes to the same
strip mall for lunch.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.992
So we went on a date
that night, that's all.

31:01.994 --> 31:05.963
So you admit that
you were with her that night.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.065
Your first date

31:08.067 --> 31:10.267
and she ends up killed.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.369
You see how you're the nexus, Jeremy?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.571
We have a gang card in there that says

31:14.573 --> 31:16.774
that you're connected
to the 54th Street G's.

31:16.776 --> 31:18.475
You better update your records.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.943
I got out of the life a while ago.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.746
Yeah, but that life always follows you.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.014
You know that.

31:29.989 --> 31:34.758
That's gang retaliation.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.427
What we don't know

31:37.429 --> 31:39.830
is were you the target

31:39.832 --> 31:42.933
or were you the instigator, Jeremy?

31:42.935 --> 31:45.135
You never saw her like that

31:45.137 --> 31:47.538
because you ran as soon as
you heard gunshots.

31:47.540 --> 31:50.274
You left that girl to die,
didn't even call 911.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.442
Which, by the way,
the medical examiner said

31:52.444 --> 31:53.877
probably would have saved her life.

31:55.981 --> 32:00.050
Who shot at you, Jeremy?

32:00.052 --> 32:04.321
Who killed Rebecca?

32:04.323 --> 32:07.858
Getting out of the life,
that doesn't make me a snitch.

32:07.860 --> 32:11.128
Yeah, what about a human being?

32:11.130 --> 32:14.364
You want to do right by her?

32:14.366 --> 32:16.633
Then help us out.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.902
It just might give you and her

32:18.904 --> 32:21.505
some peace.

32:30.082 --> 32:33.951
Yeah.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.152
Let's do it.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.687
You sure?

32:36.689 --> 32:39.323
Yeah.

32:47.633 --> 32:51.235
Carlos Brigante, 26,
lifelong Latin Player.

32:51.237 --> 32:54.071
Turns out he's been
gunning for Jeremy Reynolds

32:54.073 --> 32:57.374
ever since Reynolds shot his
baby brother, Pikey Brigante,

32:57.376 --> 32:58.609
in the ass two years ago.

32:58.611 --> 32:59.910
Reynolds say what went down?

32:59.912 --> 33:02.145
Yeah, talk about random.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.981
After work, Reynolds and Rebecca Clark,

33:03.983 --> 33:05.148
they go out to dinner.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.283
Now, Reynolds doesn't have a car.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.784
So being the nice girl that Rebecca is,

33:07.786 --> 33:09.119
she offers to drive him home.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.288
They stop at the corner store
just as Brigante

33:11.290 --> 33:12.556
happens to be walking by.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.592
He spots Reynolds, pulls
his gun, shoots up the car.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.127
Reynolds dives out the passenger side,

33:17.129 --> 33:18.128
doesn't get hit once.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.897
So Brigante is our silver hoodie?

33:19.899 --> 33:21.298
That's right, emptied his piece,

33:21.300 --> 33:22.666
ran into the Red Line station.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.501
- Rebecca was just a casualty.
- Intelligence.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.169
Wrong place, wrong time.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.871
All this over some old beef.

33:27.873 --> 33:28.939
Thanks.

33:28.941 --> 33:31.575
Gang Unit has the location on Brigante.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.378
A Players stash house in Pilsen.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.314
Good.

33:40.686 --> 33:41.985
Chicago PD!

33:43.088 --> 33:44.888
Get down! Get down on the...

33:44.890 --> 33:45.890
Turn over!

34:04.743 --> 34:06.743
Hey, he's got a vest on.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.578
- Aim for his head.
- Got it.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.469
Dispatch,

34:33.472 --> 34:36.340
we got shots fired by
the offender and police.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.456
Offender is down with
a gunshot to the head.

34:40.099 --> 34:42.404
You all right, girl?

34:42.748 --> 34:43.871
Yeah.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.550
You all right, just breathe.

34:54.731 --> 34:56.699
It's done.

34:56.701 --> 34:57.967
Two in the back of the head.

34:57.969 --> 34:59.201
My God.

34:59.203 --> 35:00.703
The back half of what you owe me.

35:00.705 --> 35:04.273
Yes, o... okay.

35:06.344 --> 35:09.712
My God.

35:09.714 --> 35:12.882
It's all there, it's there.

35:12.884 --> 35:16.786
Listen, I... I... I guess I should say

35:16.788 --> 35:18.921
thank you.

35:18.923 --> 35:22.024
Thank you.

35:24.062 --> 35:26.862
You know, Omar Fry,

35:26.864 --> 35:29.765
he didn't kill your daughter.

35:29.767 --> 35:32.134
What do you mean?

35:32.136 --> 35:34.170
But we caught the guy that did.

35:37.608 --> 35:39.075
You're a cop?

35:39.077 --> 35:41.944
I'm sorry.

35:43.714 --> 35:45.514
- Hey...
- Up against the wall.

35:45.516 --> 35:47.183
Donald Clark, you're under arrest

35:47.185 --> 35:50.286
for the solicitation of murder.

36:16.481 --> 36:19.014
Come in here.

36:23.921 --> 36:26.489
All right.

36:26.491 --> 36:27.857
This is everything you came in with.

36:27.859 --> 36:29.992
It's $33 cash, a Metro pass,

36:29.994 --> 36:33.129
your phone, and your shoelaces.

36:33.131 --> 36:34.864
I spoke to the state's attorney.

36:34.866 --> 36:37.133
Your brother's gonna be out in an hour.

36:37.135 --> 36:38.300
Next time I get something,

36:38.302 --> 36:41.337
I'm taking it to my guy in Narcotics.

36:41.339 --> 36:43.772
He won't lock me up
for bringing him a score.

36:43.774 --> 36:47.510
I got your brother out
on 100 pounds of weed.

36:47.512 --> 36:49.678
And that old man you set up
is gonna do ten years

36:49.680 --> 36:52.014
for trying to avenge his kid.

36:52.016 --> 36:54.350
Come on, Scrap.

36:54.352 --> 36:57.486
Don't be a sore winner.

36:57.488 --> 37:00.589
I'll be seeing you.

37:11.702 --> 37:14.803
I worked with your old man.

37:16.307 --> 37:17.773
Fresh out of the academy.

37:17.775 --> 37:19.041
Yeah?

37:19.043 --> 37:20.342
Yeah.

37:20.344 --> 37:23.712
Good ol' Disco Bob.

37:23.714 --> 37:24.914
My first days were spent

37:24.916 --> 37:28.784
shotgun in your old man's patrol car.

37:28.786 --> 37:30.886
Small world.

37:34.892 --> 37:38.027
We,

37:38.029 --> 37:39.562
we locked up this drunk kid one night.

37:39.564 --> 37:41.997
And I'm... I'm uncuffing him
to put him in the tank,

37:41.999 --> 37:43.132
and he takes a swing at me.

37:43.134 --> 37:45.167
And of course I teach him a lesson,

37:45.169 --> 37:47.770
sent him back on his ass.

37:47.772 --> 37:51.707
Turns out he's
my desk sergeant's godson.

37:51.709 --> 37:56.478
The desk sergeant threatened
to send me down to Hegewisch.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.615
And only later did I find out that,

37:59.617 --> 38:01.550
that your old man played poker with him.

38:01.552 --> 38:02.551
Worked it all out.

38:02.553 --> 38:03.919
You know, if you send him

38:03.921 --> 38:05.621
a bottle of something barrel aged,

38:05.623 --> 38:08.224
he'll appreciate you for it.

38:11.095 --> 38:13.762
This sergeant I know, he's,

38:13.764 --> 38:14.964
he's putting together a narcotics team,

38:14.966 --> 38:19.101
wants me to be his number two.

38:19.103 --> 38:22.238
It's lots of surveillance,
which, you know,

38:22.240 --> 38:25.341
means lots of overtime.

38:27.511 --> 38:29.545
Put your stuff back in your locker.

38:29.547 --> 38:31.213
What? No.

38:31.215 --> 38:33.916
Brother, you don't owe me.
You don't owe me a thing.

38:33.918 --> 38:36.852
Look, my last gang team,

38:36.854 --> 38:40.389
we were tight for five years.

38:40.391 --> 38:44.526
And I thought

38:44.528 --> 38:48.631
that that's... that's where I belonged.

38:48.633 --> 38:52.534
And I lost that.

38:52.536 --> 38:54.903
I know how this feels.

38:54.905 --> 38:58.774
So as far as your desk is concerned,

38:58.776 --> 39:01.877
I was just holding it down for you.

39:08.386 --> 39:10.886
Tell your dad hi for me.

39:10.888 --> 39:12.988
I will.

39:28.773 --> 39:30.005
Hey.

39:30.007 --> 39:31.840
Hey.

39:31.842 --> 39:34.343
Dad, I know why you called.

39:34.345 --> 39:35.711
I'm not moving back home.

39:35.713 --> 39:37.479
Hold on, slow down, slow down.

39:37.481 --> 39:39.815
I didn't call you because of that.

39:39.817 --> 39:40.883
Then what's the deal?

39:40.885 --> 39:42.985
I've got Jason waiting for me outside.

39:42.987 --> 39:46.855
All right, um.

39:46.857 --> 39:51.560
I just wanted to say
how much I love you.

39:51.562 --> 39:53.829
Okay.

39:54.932 --> 39:57.099
You could have told me that
over the phone.

39:57.101 --> 39:59.802
I know.

39:59.804 --> 40:01.737
Just give me a hug.

40:16.987 --> 40:19.355
Well, look who's classing up the joint.

40:19.357 --> 40:21.256
Brian.

40:21.258 --> 40:22.558
What can I get for you?

40:22.560 --> 40:23.592
Vodka tonic.

40:23.594 --> 40:26.962
And, I've got his next one.

40:26.964 --> 40:28.564
Done.

40:42.780 --> 40:46.982
We had this case.

40:46.984 --> 40:49.385
Black kid, 14,

40:49.387 --> 40:51.253
was killed by this white store owner

40:51.255 --> 40:55.591
up in, Rogers Park.

40:55.593 --> 40:58.127
They got into this argument
over the price of milk,

40:58.129 --> 41:01.230
and it escalated.

41:03.768 --> 41:07.069
Store owner

41:07.071 --> 41:09.104
thought the kid was pulling a gun

41:09.106 --> 41:10.906
when the kid was going for his wallet,

41:10.908 --> 41:15.544
and he shot the kid dead.

41:15.546 --> 41:18.480
Claimed self-defense, and he walked,

41:18.482 --> 41:21.016
this morning.

41:24.922 --> 41:29.792
I came at you with a full head of steam.

41:29.794 --> 41:32.895
I want to apologize.

41:40.204 --> 41:41.670
Hey.

41:48.579 --> 41:52.314
You know, I got two daughters...
