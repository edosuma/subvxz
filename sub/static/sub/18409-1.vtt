01:18.691 --> 01:21.091
After all these years of searching,

01:23.779 --> 01:26.275
the skull is mine.

01:34.193 --> 01:35.729
Looks like we're too late.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.809
What is that thing?

01:37.555 --> 01:41.007
That is the Crystal Skull. One
of the lost treasures of Atlantis.

01:41.251 --> 01:44.611
Thought to be the most powerful
precognitive medium in the known universe.

01:46.289 --> 01:48.369
It can show you the future

01:48.369 --> 01:51.633
and be incredibly deadly
in the wrong hands.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.353
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

01:54.353 --> 01:57.009
I'm going to go down
there. Get that skull.

01:57.009 --> 01:59.825
But there's at least six of
them and there's only two of us.

01:59.825 --> 02:00.784
And they got guns.

02:01.169 --> 02:02.298
Relax.

02:01.891 --> 02:05.251
This kind of stuff
happens to me all the time.

02:09.139 --> 02:11.379
Let's seal this place off.

02:11.379 --> 02:13.299
Get the hell out of here.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.899
Put the dynamite down there.

02:14.851 --> 02:18.211
You. In the corner. Set it down.

02:19.171 --> 02:21.571
Let's go. Come on.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.651
Let's get out of here, boys. Let's go.

02:26.611 --> 02:29.363
You. Enough.

02:29.363 --> 02:31.827
In the corner. That's it.

02:34.323 --> 02:35.539
Block off the path.

02:35.539 --> 02:37.620
All right, we got it. Now can we go?

02:37.620 --> 02:38.963
Yep.

02:41.971 --> 02:43.827
Flynn. I don't believe it.

02:47.539 --> 02:49.651
Let's move. Do you know what this is?

02:49.651 --> 02:52.020
It's an authentic Sioux arrowhead.

02:52.020 --> 02:55.091
This means that the Sioux migrated
further west than previously thought.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.787
That's great. I got
five of those back home.

02:56.787 --> 02:58.131
Now can we get out of here?

02:58.131 --> 03:02.259
Just gonna see if I can pry it loose.

03:02.259 --> 03:05.459
Set the charge so we
can blow this place up.

03:05.862 --> 03:06.886
Come on down.

03:11.910 --> 03:13.126
Hi.

03:14.182 --> 03:16.774
We were-- We were
just... Arrowhead.

03:16.774 --> 03:18.374
They've got the skull. Kill them.

03:18.374 --> 03:20.421
Run, Yellow Hawk.

03:20.421 --> 03:22.022
Come on!

03:23.750 --> 03:26.342
Does this kind of stuff happen
to you all the time, too?

03:26.342 --> 03:27.782
You get used to it.

03:33.062 --> 03:34.790
Easy. Easy. Easy.

03:37.766 --> 03:40.006
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

03:50.854 --> 03:53.413
After them. Get the skull.

04:08.966 --> 04:10.790
I think we lost them.

04:24.326 --> 04:25.382
Go!

04:35.782 --> 04:36.966
Whoa!

04:45.062 --> 04:46.502
These rocks.

04:56.006 --> 04:58.022
Don't let them get away.

05:00.614 --> 05:02.534
There's no way out.
We have to turn around.

05:02.534 --> 05:03.974
That's a tamarisk shrub.

05:03.974 --> 05:06.790
Wherever there's a tamarisk,
there's got to be...

05:06.790 --> 05:08.805
What month is it? It's
March, right? What?

05:08.805 --> 05:11.014
Okay. When I say jump, we jump.

05:11.014 --> 05:13.286
Jump? Are you out of your mind?

05:15.782 --> 05:17.093
Let's go.

05:23.302 --> 05:24.486
Ready?

05:52.582 --> 05:53.830
How did you know?

05:53.830 --> 05:55.141
Tamarisk shrub.

05:55.141 --> 05:56.934
It only grows near rivers.

05:56.934 --> 05:58.310
And Utah's average water level

05:58.310 --> 06:00.134
for March is 5 feet,
three-quarter inches.

06:00.134 --> 06:02.694
So I figured that would be
enough to break our fall.

06:03.525 --> 06:04.774
But it's April.

06:05.254 --> 06:06.502
April?

06:07.430 --> 06:08.646
Really?

06:10.150 --> 06:11.494
Huh?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.406
We should have been

06:14.406 --> 06:16.261
smashed like pancakes.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.974
I guess we got really lucky...

06:23.589 --> 06:24.806
April?

06:59.910 --> 07:02.310
Boy. Boy. Come here. Come here.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.166
I want you to take this
to the post office for me.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.510
Do you understand?

07:05.510 --> 07:07.366
Hurry. Hurry. It's very important.

07:07.366 --> 07:10.374
Now, go. Hurry. Here.
Here. Yeah. Now go. Go.

07:10.374 --> 07:12.134
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

07:36.230 --> 07:39.014
The secret shall be passed.

07:41.190 --> 07:44.166
Whatever you've done
with it, I will find it.

08:05.990 --> 08:08.710
Flynn, you're 1.2 minutes late.

08:08.710 --> 08:11.206
I'll be sure to deduct
that from your pay.

08:11.206 --> 08:13.030
Judson is looking for you downstairs.

08:13.030 --> 08:16.582
Oh, I hope you remembered to
save your receipts this time.

08:17.574 --> 08:19.653
What, did we acquire a new statue?

08:19.653 --> 08:22.982
No, Steve, the guard, accidentally
looked at Medusa's head.

08:22.982 --> 08:24.550
Turned to stone.

08:24.550 --> 08:26.406
Who covers that? Is that health
insurance or Workman's Comp?

08:26.406 --> 08:29.926
This is a place of
business, not your home.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.494
I would appreciate it

08:31.494 --> 08:34.501
if you did not have your
personal correspondence sent here.

08:34.501 --> 08:36.390
Don't you have an apartment?
I have an apartment.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.342
I'm never there. I'm always working.

08:38.342 --> 08:41.732
Well, your landlord called,
and you're late on your rent.

08:41.732 --> 08:44.486
Your mother wants you
to stop by after work.

08:44.486 --> 08:47.270
Oh. And this came for you.

08:49.030 --> 08:50.629
Egypt?

08:50.629 --> 08:54.310
Well, now that I'm done playing
secretary, I have work to do.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.294
And so do you.

09:09.446 --> 09:11.462
Good morning. Lou.

09:14.726 --> 09:17.062
I was sorry to hear about Steve.

09:26.726 --> 09:28.646
Hello?

09:28.646 --> 09:31.301
Hello? Judson? I'm home.

09:38.502 --> 09:40.294
Excalibur.

09:40.294 --> 09:43.494
Not now, okay? I'm not in the mood.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.702
Can you not see that I'm
just a little bit preoccupied?

09:55.174 --> 09:56.326
Okay.

09:57.734 --> 10:00.709
You want to play? I'll play with you.

10:00.709 --> 10:02.374
Here we go.

10:23.142 --> 10:26.374
Ah! Now I've got you.
You're all washed up.

10:28.326 --> 10:30.246
That's enough for today.

10:32.230 --> 10:35.846
It's best not to use water
analogies with Poseidon's trident.

10:35.846 --> 10:38.150
Judson, I know you've instructed
Excalibur to attack me at will,

10:38.150 --> 10:39.654
but this is a little ridiculous.

10:39.654 --> 10:41.285
It's all part of the plan.
I'm just coming off a mission.

10:41.285 --> 10:43.110
It's part of your training. I
haven't even had a cup of coffee.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.934
And I've been wearing the same
clothes for the last four days,

10:44.934 --> 10:46.022
and I'm wet again. Keeps you sharp.

10:46.022 --> 10:47.846
Besides, you almost had him that time.

10:49.030 --> 10:51.942
Uh, you're using the Shroud of Turin.

10:57.734 --> 10:59.750
Leo?

10:59.750 --> 11:02.854
Leo, I thought I told you
to put the Shroud away.

11:03.494 --> 11:04.550
Sorry, Judson.

11:04.550 --> 11:05.862
Follow me, Flynn.

11:12.326 --> 11:14.406
Come on. There's something
I want to show you.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.270
Oh, wow.

11:20.901 --> 11:22.982
I don't believe it.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.246
This is a completely
different part of the library.

11:26.246 --> 11:28.902
I'm honored that you'd show it to me.

11:28.902 --> 11:31.109
This is the service entrance.

11:32.486 --> 11:35.046
So, how did, uh, how did Utah go?

11:36.134 --> 11:40.230
One Crystal Skull, as promised.

11:40.230 --> 11:44.870
Well, I think the library's
going to be a much safer home.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.294
Looks like I saved the world. Again.

11:49.862 --> 11:51.110
Barely.

11:52.390 --> 11:55.430
Barely? What's that supposed to mean?

11:55.430 --> 11:58.182
I heard about the incident
at the burial cave.

11:58.182 --> 12:01.190
You risked your life and almost...

12:02.534 --> 12:04.582
And almost lost the skull.

12:05.990 --> 12:08.966
All because of some artifact.

12:08.966 --> 12:11.366
Oh, that was no ordinary artifact.

12:11.366 --> 12:14.309
That was an authentic Sioux
arrowhead. In Utah, of all places.

12:14.309 --> 12:16.934
And--and where is
the arrowhead now?

12:18.534 --> 12:23.110
Um, well, I lost it, jumping off
a cliff into the Colorado River.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.934
But you should have seen it. It was...

12:24.934 --> 12:27.622
Yeah, your little escapade could have
jeopardized the--the--the whole mission.

12:27.622 --> 12:32.006
Okay, you know, Judson, I've been a
librarian here for over a year now.

12:32.006 --> 12:36.070
And in that time, I have saved
the world from--from magic spears

12:36.070 --> 12:37.702
and time-traveling ninjas

12:37.702 --> 12:40.326
and--and--and everything
else that you can think of.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.310
I think I'm doing a pretty good job.

12:42.310 --> 12:43.846
You have.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.245
Well, then when are you
going to... When are you...

12:46.245 --> 12:48.869
Can you stop playing
for one second, please?

12:50.054 --> 12:51.654
When are you going to start to trust me?

12:51.654 --> 12:53.222
Flynn, I--I--I
trust you.

12:53.222 --> 12:55.654
I mean, we--we send you
out on missions alone.

12:55.654 --> 12:58.214
It's just... You have a lot to learn.

12:58.214 --> 13:00.422
I mean, sometimes you have to give up

13:00.422 --> 13:02.565
what you want for--for
the greater good.

13:03.430 --> 13:05.862
See, that's the difference

13:05.862 --> 13:09.670
between a good librarian
and--and a great librarian.

13:11.686 --> 13:12.870
Are you all right?

13:12.870 --> 13:16.070
I mean, is something else bothering you?

13:16.070 --> 13:18.342
No. I've-- I've
got work to do.

13:31.846 --> 13:34.182
Hello? Mom?

13:34.182 --> 13:36.070
I got a message that
you wanted me to stop by.

13:36.070 --> 13:37.286
Surprise!

13:37.286 --> 13:38.502
Surprise!

13:40.166 --> 13:43.974
Oh, my God. I've died and gone to hell.

13:43.974 --> 13:46.822
Oh. 32 years old. I don't believe it.

13:46.822 --> 13:50.565
My baby boy is all grown up.
Mom, you know I hate these things.

13:50.565 --> 13:53.093
What things? Birthdays? Nonsense.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.174
Who doesn't like birthdays?

13:55.174 --> 13:56.646
Who are these people?

13:56.646 --> 13:58.534
Oh, friends, relatives.

13:58.534 --> 14:00.486
The girls from my mahjong club.

14:00.486 --> 14:03.366
What? You keep your life so
secret, I don't know who to invite.

14:03.366 --> 14:04.646
Oh, there's someone I want you to meet.

14:04.646 --> 14:06.790
No, Mom. I don't want...
No more matchmaking.

14:06.790 --> 14:09.382
I know. I know. But this
one's perfect. Perfect.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.262
Rose? Rose?

14:12.262 --> 14:15.686
Rose, Flynn. Flynn, Rose.

14:15.686 --> 14:19.013
I'm getting goosebumps just
looking at the two of you.

14:19.013 --> 14:21.254
Hello, Flynn. Happy birthday. Thank you.

14:22.886 --> 14:25.286
You're Rose Edwards. Yes.

14:25.286 --> 14:27.046
Isn't she charming?

14:28.646 --> 14:30.406
Would you excuse us for one second?

14:30.406 --> 14:31.526
Sure.

14:31.526 --> 14:33.542
What's wrong? Too skinny?

14:34.822 --> 14:37.350
She's my third cousin. So?

14:37.350 --> 14:39.974
So, I don't even think that's
legal in certain states.

14:39.974 --> 14:41.670
Well, what's the big
deal? She's your cousin.

14:41.670 --> 14:43.302
You'll have plenty to talk about.

14:43.302 --> 14:45.574
Honey. Honey, it's your birthday.

14:45.574 --> 14:48.550
Relax. Relax. Have a good time.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.142
Oh, I've got to set up the karaoke.

14:51.142 --> 14:53.190
Oh, no, no!

14:55.430 --> 14:58.534
So how's Aunt Laura? Good.

14:58.534 --> 15:01.766
She's having a new hip put in next week.

15:01.766 --> 15:03.366
I need a drink. I need a big drink.

15:03.366 --> 15:04.550
Can I get you anything else? No.

15:04.550 --> 15:05.701
You're good? Okay. Yeah.

15:05.701 --> 15:07.014
Excuse me one second.

15:10.374 --> 15:12.262
I hope you're old enough to drink that.

15:12.262 --> 15:15.366
Uncle Jerry! What are you doing here?

15:15.366 --> 15:17.222
Oh. I thought you were in South America.

15:17.222 --> 15:18.630
Nepal. And I came back early.

15:18.630 --> 15:19.846
I couldn't miss the opportunity

15:19.846 --> 15:21.382
to see your mother embarrass you.

15:21.382 --> 15:22.950
Oh. You have no idea.

15:22.950 --> 15:25.126
She's out there trying to
fix me up with my own cousin.

15:25.126 --> 15:26.310
Better make that a double.

15:26.310 --> 15:28.582
Coming up. So Nepal?
That sounds exciting.

15:28.582 --> 15:30.822
I'm telling you, Flynn, there's
a lot of money to be made

15:30.822 --> 15:32.806
in the import-export business.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.246
If you ever want a job,

15:34.246 --> 15:36.646
you can get out of that
stuffy library job of yours,

15:36.646 --> 15:39.014
go out and see the world.
Jerry, I think I'm okay.

15:39.014 --> 15:40.262
All right.

15:41.094 --> 15:44.134
Mmm. Anyway. Excuse me.

15:46.502 --> 15:48.966
Furniture wasn't the only
thing I picked up in Nepal.

15:48.966 --> 15:51.110
Happy birthday, kiddo. Wow.

15:52.742 --> 15:55.846
This is amazing. It's
a Tibetan shadow box.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.142
From the Qing Dynasty,
judging from the woodwork.

15:59.142 --> 16:01.606
I figured you'd know more about
the darn thing than I would.

16:01.606 --> 16:03.014
Open it up.

16:08.870 --> 16:11.942
That picture was taken
shortly after I met your dad.

16:11.942 --> 16:16.326
That was, what, 38 years ago.

16:17.605 --> 16:19.173
The two of us.

16:20.422 --> 16:23.973
We were best friends right off the bat.

16:23.973 --> 16:26.374
After the war, your dad met your mother.

16:26.374 --> 16:28.742
Well, we both met her,

16:28.742 --> 16:30.726
but he swept her off her feet.

16:30.726 --> 16:32.326
Lucky bastard.

16:33.542 --> 16:36.486
You know, in the hospital,
right after you were born,

16:36.486 --> 16:38.150
your dad made me swear

16:38.150 --> 16:42.470
that I would take care of you
if anything ever happened to him.

16:42.470 --> 16:45.093
Now, I know I've said it before,

16:45.093 --> 16:47.973
but I just want to remind you I'm
there for you if you ever need me.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.142
Yeah, I know. Thank you.

16:53.190 --> 16:55.653
Flynn, it's your turn to sing.

16:55.653 --> 16:58.694
Jerry, oh, I didn't think
you would be able to come.

16:58.694 --> 17:00.230
Margie, you know, what is it?

17:00.230 --> 17:02.502
You get younger and more
beautiful every time I see you.

17:02.502 --> 17:04.773
Come on, now. Let's join the party.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.750
The three of us can
do a number together.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.541
We're gonna need this.

17:19.526 --> 17:21.190
There you are.

17:21.190 --> 17:23.846
Well, finally everyone left, thank God.

17:25.030 --> 17:26.374
You all right?

17:26.374 --> 17:29.190
Yeah, I'm just looking at some
old pictures of me and Dad.

17:29.190 --> 17:31.814
I bet this day was really hard for you.

17:33.030 --> 17:35.782
I've been thinking about him all day.

17:35.782 --> 17:38.214
He was 32 when he died. I'm 32 now.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.734
And I feel like I didn't
even know who he was.

17:41.734 --> 17:44.614
You know who he was.

17:44.614 --> 17:47.910
He was a dress salesman from
Brooklyn and he loved his family.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.926
Now, what more did you need to know?

17:49.926 --> 17:51.014
Him.

17:52.870 --> 17:54.406
I hardly ever saw him.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.062
I mean, he was always traveling.
He was gone all the time.

17:57.062 --> 17:59.046
I mean, I've got 22 degrees.

17:59.046 --> 18:01.574
I've got all this useless
information at the tip of my fingers.

18:01.574 --> 18:04.134
I can't tell you one
thing about my own father.

18:05.510 --> 18:07.526
I want to show you something.

18:07.526 --> 18:09.382
What? What do you got?

18:09.382 --> 18:11.302
It was very special.

18:11.302 --> 18:15.206
He bought this at a secondhand store.

18:15.206 --> 18:20.006
He would joke about it and say
this was the Carson family seal,

18:20.006 --> 18:22.470
that we were descended from kings.

18:27.142 --> 18:28.614
He would put that on

18:28.614 --> 18:31.205
and tell you the most
extraordinary bedtime stories

18:31.205 --> 18:34.406
about magical kingdoms
and upside-down valleys.

18:34.406 --> 18:36.166
Yeah, and the laughing rocks.

18:36.166 --> 18:37.670
See, I remember.

18:38.470 --> 18:40.166
I remember.

18:40.994 --> 18:44.514
I used to draw pictures of it for
him, waiting for him to come home.

18:49.443 --> 18:52.675
What? You did not. You saved these?

18:52.675 --> 18:56.258
Well, I thought you would want
them someday. To remember him.

18:57.922 --> 19:00.515
Yeah. I remember the stories.

19:00.515 --> 19:04.130
I remember the silly little fantasies.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.491
But nothing about him.

19:07.491 --> 19:10.563
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

19:12.451 --> 19:15.715
Maybe these pictures say
more than you realize.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.298
Oh, my God.

20:05.443 --> 20:06.819
Hello? Judson, it's me.

20:06.819 --> 20:08.419
I think you'd better
get over here right away.

20:08.419 --> 20:09.731
What is it?

20:09.731 --> 20:11.234
Well, somebody sent me
something in the mail today

20:11.234 --> 20:13.698
and I think...

20:13.698 --> 20:15.299
Flynn, are you--
are you still there?

20:15.299 --> 20:17.698
There's somebody in my apartment.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.011
Okay, I know you're in there.

20:35.011 --> 20:38.274
I have a weapon.

20:45.538 --> 20:48.035
Let's see if I can
find some food for you.

20:56.610 --> 20:58.915
Flynn, are, are you all right?

20:58.915 --> 21:00.483
Yeah. Yeah.

21:00.483 --> 21:04.355
Although, I think my head
might disagree with me.

21:05.410 --> 21:07.491
You have a pretty nasty bump there.

21:08.611 --> 21:10.594
Who--who did
this to you?

21:10.594 --> 21:12.899
Some guy was waiting
for me when I came home.

21:12.899 --> 21:15.202
He was probably looking for...

21:17.218 --> 21:19.234
The scroll. It's gone. He took it.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.218
Somebody sent it to me in the mail.

21:21.218 --> 21:22.819
It was an ancient parchment.

21:22.819 --> 21:24.194
Vellum or papyrus.

21:24.194 --> 21:26.562
Probably at least 3,000 years old.

21:26.562 --> 21:29.090
It had a little symbol in the
corner. Star of David and...

21:29.090 --> 21:30.851
A crescent moon at the bottom.

21:32.322 --> 21:33.858
Yeah.

21:33.858 --> 21:35.714
How did you know that?

21:35.714 --> 21:37.474
King Solomon's seal.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.451
King Solomon.

21:40.451 --> 21:43.363
It's been a while since I was
in Sunday school. Let me see.

21:43.363 --> 21:46.018
Solomon ruled Israel during
the 10th century, B.C.

21:46.018 --> 21:49.250
Regarded as being one of the
Bible's wisest and richest kings.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.619
He stored his immense
wealth in a golden temple

21:51.619 --> 21:55.139
built by 24 masons,
hand-picked by Solomon himself.

21:55.139 --> 21:58.914
Correct. Only he didn't keep
everything in the temple.

21:58.914 --> 22:02.498
For fear of looting, his
personal prized possessions

22:03.523 --> 22:05.378
were secretly stored somewhere else.

22:05.378 --> 22:07.842
Wait a minute.

22:07.842 --> 22:10.819
Are you talking about
King Solomon's Mines?

22:10.819 --> 22:12.002
That's just a legend, isn't it?

22:12.002 --> 22:14.114
Hello?

22:14.114 --> 22:17.539
Flynn, how long have you
been working here? Right.

22:17.539 --> 22:20.290
For centuries, men have
sought Solomon's treasures.

22:20.290 --> 22:24.034
Only the location of the
Mines has never been found.

22:24.034 --> 22:28.930
It was rumored only the 24 masons
knew and they devised a map.

22:30.178 --> 22:32.674
What you received in
the mail was that map.

22:32.674 --> 22:34.882
That was a map? No, no, no, no.

22:34.882 --> 22:38.370
Just like a bunch of
random symbols and markings.

22:38.370 --> 22:40.962
Sometimes looks can be deceiving.

22:40.962 --> 22:43.170
Okay, so if that was the map,

22:43.170 --> 22:46.210
then the guys that were in my apartment

22:46.210 --> 22:49.155
were actually looking for
King Solomon's treasure.

22:49.155 --> 22:52.099
And you're just figuring that out now?

22:52.099 --> 22:54.850
I got hit on the head.

22:54.850 --> 22:57.091
Well, I'm afraid there's more.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.363
Key of Solomon.

23:03.363 --> 23:05.475
An ancient tome with incredible powers.

23:05.475 --> 23:09.794
It's believed that Solomon used
those powers to rule his people.

23:09.794 --> 23:11.843
Yeah, I've heard of this before.

23:11.843 --> 23:14.691
It could summon the
powers of the underworld.

23:14.691 --> 23:17.378
And it could bend space and time.

23:17.378 --> 23:21.218
If the Key of Solomon were ever
to fall into the wrong hands...

23:23.202 --> 23:25.410
The fate of the world, right?

23:26.595 --> 23:27.811
Right.

23:29.635 --> 23:31.522
Fortunately for us, the map is useless

23:31.522 --> 23:35.362
without the legend piece to decipher it.

23:35.362 --> 23:39.235
The map legend is located in Volubilis,

23:39.235 --> 23:41.538
near the Roman
ruins in--in Morocco.

23:41.538 --> 23:44.162
Roman ruins. Check.

23:44.162 --> 23:48.643
Flynn, retrieve the map
and the legend, if you can.

23:48.643 --> 23:53.058
The location of King Solomon's
Mines must never be found.

23:53.058 --> 23:55.874
Boy. That whole "I'm off on a mission

23:55.874 --> 23:58.818
"where there's a good chance
I'll probably die" feeling,

23:58.818 --> 24:00.034
that never really goes away, does it?

24:00.034 --> 24:01.602
Look, don't worry.

24:01.602 --> 24:04.003
Just do what I've taught you
to do, and--and you'll be fine.

24:05.538 --> 24:07.810
Your plane leaves in two hours.

24:08.674 --> 24:10.915
You're going to Casablanca.

24:10.915 --> 24:12.291
Casablanca?

24:12.291 --> 24:14.274
You mean like the movie Casablanca?

24:14.274 --> 24:17.314
Oh, I love that movie.

24:17.314 --> 24:18.882
Charleen,

24:18.882 --> 24:22.883
"I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

24:22.883 --> 24:24.515
No, it's not.

24:24.515 --> 24:27.202
Be safe. Don't get killed.

24:27.939 --> 24:29.698
Save your receipts.

24:33.730 --> 24:35.235
Did you tell him?

24:36.162 --> 24:37.378
No.

24:37.378 --> 24:39.394
You should have told him.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.835
He'll find out soon enough.

25:02.338 --> 25:05.250
Rick's American Cafe,
and make it snappy, pal.

25:06.530 --> 25:08.611
From the movie Casablanca.

25:08.611 --> 25:10.978
How delightfully original of you.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.954
The Volubilis ruins, please.

25:20.610 --> 25:23.171
Volubilis ruins, Bogey.

25:29.603 --> 25:31.138
Sorry, sorry.

25:46.498 --> 25:47.939
You're not digging deep enough.

25:47.939 --> 25:49.378
We haven't even broken
through the sedimentary layer.

25:49.378 --> 25:51.202
Miss Emily, we've been
digging for weeks and weeks

25:51.202 --> 25:52.258
and we have found nothing.

25:52.258 --> 25:53.443
Well, then, we widen the grid.

25:53.443 --> 25:55.138
We've done that already. Twice.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.962
Do it again. Till we find something.

25:58.722 --> 26:00.130
Who's that?

26:02.851 --> 26:04.163
Keep digging.

26:10.498 --> 26:12.803
Excuse me? Can I help you?

26:12.803 --> 26:15.490
Well, I hope you know how rare this is.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.530
Emblema mosaic, Roman, circa 40 A.D.

26:20.898 --> 26:23.074
50 A.D., not 40.

26:23.074 --> 26:24.834
50 A.D. Right. That's what I meant.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.235
I get confused. I was
recently hit on the head.

26:27.235 --> 26:30.275
Hmm. Who are you? What do you want?

26:30.275 --> 26:32.674
My name is Flynn Carson. I'm
with the Geological Institute.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.010
We're doing a soil survey in the region.

26:35.010 --> 26:39.458
You seem awfully familiar with
Roman artifacts for a geologist.

26:40.610 --> 26:42.211
It's a hobby of mine.

26:42.211 --> 26:44.610
This is a private dig, Mr. Carson.

26:44.610 --> 26:46.722
I'm afraid your survey
will have to wait.

26:49.276 --> 26:50.716
That's okay.

26:51.420 --> 26:53.212
I don't mind waiting.

27:01.692 --> 27:03.612
Okay. I do mind waiting.

27:07.931 --> 27:09.692
Computer imaging.

27:09.692 --> 27:11.452
High-resolution digital photography.

27:11.452 --> 27:13.820
This is a very impressive
setup you have here, Miss...

27:13.820 --> 27:16.219
Davenport. Emily Davenport.

27:16.219 --> 27:17.660
What exactly are you looking for?

27:17.660 --> 27:19.260
If you don't mind me asking.

27:19.260 --> 27:20.988
Evidence to prove that this area

27:20.988 --> 27:23.547
was once ruled by the Queen of Sheba.

27:23.547 --> 27:24.828
Queen of Sheba?

27:24.828 --> 27:27.196
As in King Solomon's wife
from the Old Testament.

27:27.196 --> 27:28.316
That's the one.

27:28.316 --> 27:30.172
But I thought that
her reign only extended

27:30.172 --> 27:31.708
to parts of southern Arabia.

27:31.708 --> 27:33.308
Well, I'm going to prove otherwise.

27:33.308 --> 27:34.780
Excuse me.

27:36.316 --> 27:37.916
Have you found anything?

27:37.916 --> 27:40.827
A Roman antechamber
in the southwest grid.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.972
What about something unusual?

27:42.972 --> 27:47.035
Like, say, for example, something
that could be used to read a map.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.955
You're the second person
to ask me that today.

27:52.955 --> 27:55.132
Somebody else was here? Yes.

27:55.132 --> 27:57.180
And they were snooping
around rather like you are.

27:57.180 --> 27:59.515
Wow. Two people in the same
day. That's quite a coincidence.

27:59.515 --> 28:00.827
Where did you say you were from again?

28:00.827 --> 28:02.907
I'm from the Geological Institute.

28:02.907 --> 28:04.732
So you must know John Binder over there.

28:04.732 --> 28:06.876
Tell me, how's old
John doing these days?

28:08.636 --> 28:10.939
Very good. It's a trick question.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.507
There is no John Binder.

28:12.507 --> 28:14.875
He's the Head of the Institute. Damn.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.828
I knew it. You're here to steal my dig.

28:16.828 --> 28:18.332
Uh, no.

28:18.332 --> 28:20.092
Who sent you?

28:20.092 --> 28:22.172
Was it Pierre Buboul from the Sorbonne?

28:23.292 --> 28:25.468
Yes. Yes.

28:25.468 --> 28:28.348
You tell Pierre and his vultures...

28:31.611 --> 28:33.019
Now get off my site
before I call security.

28:33.019 --> 28:34.428
If I could just have
a minute of your time...

28:34.428 --> 28:35.708
Turito. Yes?

28:35.708 --> 28:37.948
Turito, it's okay. I'm going. I'm going.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.340
You don't give up, do you?

29:05.340 --> 29:07.388
You scared the hell out of me.

29:07.388 --> 29:08.988
What, do you sleep in here?

29:10.268 --> 29:13.499
This is a permit with my name on it.

29:13.499 --> 29:15.419
It means I can have you
arrested for trespassing.

29:15.419 --> 29:18.076
And, believe me, you don't want to
spend the night in a Moroccan jail.

29:18.076 --> 29:20.252
Look, Miss Davenport.
Professor Davenport.

29:20.252 --> 29:21.756
I'm sorry I lied to you.

29:21.756 --> 29:23.195
But I'm not here to steal your dig.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.476
Then what are you here to do?

29:24.476 --> 29:26.300
It's a little hard to explain.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.995
Try me.

29:27.995 --> 29:29.532
I'm looking for a map legend

29:29.532 --> 29:33.180
that will help me decipher a
map to King Solomon's Mines.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.771
You should have stuck
with your geologist story.

29:35.771 --> 29:36.987
It was much more believable.

29:36.987 --> 29:38.620
I'm telling you the truth.

29:38.620 --> 29:42.716
And the map also tells you the location
of Atlantis and Never-Never Land, too?

29:45.979 --> 29:47.292
What are you doing?

29:47.292 --> 29:49.180
I'm looking for a secret lever.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.291
You see, the Romans often
built secret chambers

29:51.291 --> 29:53.020
into their architecture
to hide their valuables.

29:53.020 --> 29:55.452
I know all about Roman
architecture, thank you very much.

29:55.452 --> 29:57.468
There are no secret chambers here.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.316
There's always a secret chamber.

30:00.316 --> 30:01.916
Big words coming from a guy who thought

30:01.916 --> 30:03.771
the mosaic piece was from 40 A.D.

30:09.340 --> 30:12.348
Oh, look. A secret chamber.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.412
Do you know where you're standing?

30:24.412 --> 30:26.172
Claudius Ptolemy's tomb.

30:26.172 --> 30:29.020
The father of geometry and astronomy.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.580
Makes sense, really. If
you want to find a map,

30:31.580 --> 30:33.212
find a mapmaker.

30:38.300 --> 30:40.476
Look at this.

30:42.075 --> 30:45.212
That is a reproduction
of Ptolemy's famous atlas.

30:45.212 --> 30:47.931
You see, Ptolemy was
among the first to theorize

30:47.931 --> 30:50.140
that the Earth was actually spherical.

30:51.548 --> 30:54.268
Look at the top and bottom of the globe.

30:55.676 --> 30:58.395
The alignment of the
continents is all wrong.

30:58.395 --> 31:00.092
Just as I suspected.

31:16.828 --> 31:20.028
Oh, look at these symbols.

31:20.028 --> 31:22.716
Is that Hebrew? No, it's not Hebrew.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.059
Early Sumerian, maybe.

31:24.059 --> 31:27.068
It easily predates
Ptolemy by 1,000 years.

31:27.068 --> 31:29.371
It's odd. I've never
seen that symbol before.

31:31.228 --> 31:32.476
I have.

31:36.732 --> 31:39.292
The map legend must not leave the tomb.

31:39.292 --> 31:40.828
Well, can we talk about this?

31:40.828 --> 31:43.100
The legend is not yours to keep.

31:43.100 --> 31:44.700
We weren't-- we
weren't gonna keep it.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.940
Speak for yourself. This
is my dig. I have a permit.

31:53.148 --> 31:54.812
Now you die.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.668
A little help. Emily.

32:00.028 --> 32:01.468
Alakazam!

32:02.107 --> 32:03.579
The Order.

32:04.412 --> 32:05.756
What just happened?

32:06.428 --> 32:07.676
Amulet?

32:09.435 --> 32:11.772
The Order of the Cryptic Masons.

32:14.012 --> 32:18.268
You are one of us. Brother.

32:18.268 --> 32:20.828
Long have the descendants
of the original 24

32:20.828 --> 32:23.131
protected the secrets of Solomon.

32:23.131 --> 32:25.532
From Mason to Mason, the
secret shall be passed.

32:28.252 --> 32:30.236
The map legend is yours.

32:35.548 --> 32:37.275
God be with you.

32:39.036 --> 32:40.988
I think we'd better be going.

32:40.988 --> 32:42.492
We got to go. We got to go.

32:42.492 --> 32:43.772
That way.

32:46.236 --> 32:47.676
Wait.

32:47.676 --> 32:49.116
The other half of the map legend

32:49.116 --> 32:51.292
is in Kenya near the Gedi Province.

32:51.292 --> 32:54.076
Journey between the Breasts of Sheba

32:54.076 --> 32:57.628
and you will find it
with the All-seeing Eye.

32:58.780 --> 33:00.060
Now, go.

33:04.988 --> 33:06.652
Do you know where this leads?

33:06.652 --> 33:08.347
I thought you knew.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.387
Hey, look, an aqueduct.

33:11.387 --> 33:12.828
You see, the Romans often built...

33:12.828 --> 33:14.812
Enough with the history
lessons. I know what it is.

33:14.812 --> 33:17.660
It's all dried out.
There's moss growing inside.

33:17.660 --> 33:18.811
It's probably slippery enough,

33:18.811 --> 33:20.508
and I think gravity will take us.

33:22.299 --> 33:24.412
I knew I was going
to regret meeting you.

33:43.868 --> 33:45.916
Can you give us a ride into town?

33:54.460 --> 33:56.572
The American got away.
With the map piece.

33:57.211 --> 33:58.620
Find them.

34:03.260 --> 34:06.300
Those men back there are looking
for King Solomon's Mines also?

34:06.300 --> 34:09.755
Yeah. And a book called
the Key of Solomon.

34:09.755 --> 34:11.100
Well, if we want to get a jump on them,

34:11.100 --> 34:12.699
we'd better get going to Kenya.

34:12.699 --> 34:13.786
What?

34:13.786 --> 34:15.036
The other piece of the map legend

34:15.036 --> 34:16.252
is somewhere in the Gedi in Kenya.

34:16.252 --> 34:17.947
You don't even believe
in King Solomon's Mines.

34:17.947 --> 34:19.899
That map legend is over 3,000 years old.

34:19.899 --> 34:21.436
The university will fund my dig

34:21.436 --> 34:23.196
for another 10 years if I
bring them more of the same.

34:23.196 --> 34:24.859
I'm coming with you,
Flynn. I don't need you.

34:24.859 --> 34:26.812
You need me to decipher
the markings on the legend.

34:26.812 --> 34:29.820
I don't mean to brag, but I'm pretty
good at deciphering dead languages.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.260
They're not written in a dead language.

34:31.260 --> 34:33.659
They're written in Akon,

34:33.659 --> 34:36.315
an ancient form of Hebrew cryptography.

34:36.315 --> 34:38.172
Go ahead. Take a peek.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.228
I can figure this out.

34:43.228 --> 34:47.708
If you know the 312-digit polyalphabetic
cipher needed to decode it.

34:47.708 --> 34:49.788
Do you know the cipher? No.

34:50.940 --> 34:53.596
Wake me up when we get to the airport.

35:03.548 --> 35:05.019
Are you still trying to figure that out?

35:05.019 --> 35:06.876
I don't understand. I
should be able to do this.

35:06.876 --> 35:09.148
I deciphered the language
of the birds in seven hours.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.612
Give me a clue. Give me
a little clue. No, no.

35:11.612 --> 35:14.108
Give me just the first
three letters of the cipher.

35:14.108 --> 35:16.956
Gedi Province is about
a day's drive from here.

35:16.956 --> 35:20.508
I've found us a ride. But
you're not going to like it.

35:20.508 --> 35:23.067
Welcome, honeymooners, to the safari.

35:23.067 --> 35:26.108
We will have a short
five-and-a-half hour drive.

35:27.611 --> 35:29.372
Flynn?

35:29.372 --> 35:32.636
Flynn Carson? Is that you?

35:32.636 --> 35:35.035
It's me. Debra Markham.

35:35.035 --> 35:37.372
Well, Debra Potter now.

35:37.372 --> 35:40.347
Remember, our mothers set
us up on that date once.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.107
Yes. Yes, Debra.

35:42.107 --> 35:44.252
Social worker. Works
with convicted felons.

35:44.252 --> 35:48.027
Right. Well, this is my husband, Carl.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.515
We met at work.

35:51.515 --> 35:53.980
And who is this sitting beside you?

35:53.980 --> 35:55.868
Is this your new wife?

35:58.428 --> 36:02.940
Yes. Yes. Yes. This is Emily.

36:02.940 --> 36:05.628
My beautiful, beautiful
bride. What are you doing?

36:05.628 --> 36:07.356
I don't want my mother to
know why I'm really here,

36:07.356 --> 36:09.851
so just play along, okay?

36:09.851 --> 36:13.116
Everyone, this is my
friend, Flynn Carson,

36:13.116 --> 36:15.100
and his new wife, Emily.

36:15.100 --> 36:20.252
Let's give them both a
big honeymooner welcome.

37:26.332 --> 37:28.092
Send us a postcard!

37:32.219 --> 37:33.627
This is as far as they take us.

37:33.627 --> 37:36.188
Gedi's a two-day hike on foot.

37:36.188 --> 37:38.396
Anything to get off that bus.

37:49.276 --> 37:51.900
Look at that. You know what that is?

37:51.900 --> 37:54.780
That's the Enkerendi.
That's their mating dance.

37:54.780 --> 37:57.116
It's called Oloipiri, and
it's their hunting dance.

37:57.116 --> 37:58.460
Enkerendi. Oloipiri.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.155
Why do you keep doing that,
correcting me like that?

38:00.155 --> 38:01.692
You know, I'm not as
dumb as you think I am.

38:01.692 --> 38:04.540
I don't think you're dumb.
Just not as smart as I am.

38:04.540 --> 38:07.292
Well, I'll have you know I hold
12 bachelor's degrees, six master's

38:07.292 --> 38:10.172
and four PhDs, which is 22
total, which is almost a record.

38:10.172 --> 38:11.579
How many degrees do you have?

38:11.579 --> 38:14.140
Twenty-five, and I'll be starting
my twenty-sixth next June.

38:14.140 --> 38:16.060
But who's counting? Excuse me.

38:44.252 --> 38:46.747
What, are we walking too fast now?

38:47.085 --> 38:48.205
Whoa.

38:52.974 --> 38:54.253
Are you all right?

38:55.308 --> 38:57.003
I've been better.

38:59.307 --> 39:00.683
Who did this to you?

39:00.683 --> 39:03.467
I was caught stealing
crops on Bantu land.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.868
What, they just left
you out here to die?

39:05.868 --> 39:08.715
I am Nulu. I would have done the same.

39:08.715 --> 39:11.179
Grab his hand. Here we go.

39:13.323 --> 39:14.444
Pull.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.843
I am Jomo.

39:24.843 --> 39:26.220
You have saved my life.

39:26.220 --> 39:29.260
Oh, hey, I don't know about all that.

39:29.260 --> 39:32.363
I'm indebted to you. You'll
come with me to my village.

39:32.363 --> 39:35.020
There, you will be showered with food
and women and treated like a king.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.099
Well, I saved you, too.

39:37.099 --> 39:38.860
Can't you see the man is talking?

39:39.979 --> 39:42.059
I'm sorry. You were saying
something about a king?

39:42.059 --> 39:43.564
And how many women are we talking about?

39:43.564 --> 39:45.387
It's really very sweet of
you, but we should be going

39:45.387 --> 39:46.763
because we're on our way to Gedi.

39:46.763 --> 39:49.547
Gedi? Well, I know the
place. I will take you there.

39:49.547 --> 39:51.627
Where you go, Jomo will go.

39:51.627 --> 39:53.356
Oh, that's really not necessary.

39:53.356 --> 39:55.980
I will not rest until I
have paid my debt to you.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.755
Jomo will get these for you.

40:01.196 --> 40:02.348
"How many women?"

40:02.348 --> 40:04.235
You heard the man. It's his custom.

40:26.604 --> 40:28.940
Want a chocolate bar? Not for me.

40:31.339 --> 40:34.155
Oh, look, a hoopoe bird.

40:34.155 --> 40:36.843
Two thousand years ago, King
Solomon used to send birds

40:36.843 --> 40:40.363
to fly messages across
to the Queen of Sheba.

40:40.363 --> 40:43.755
And now, here it is, all those
years later, flying over our heads.

40:45.035 --> 40:48.588
You've always been interested
in the Queen of Sheba?

40:48.588 --> 40:50.827
Ever since I was a little girl.

40:50.827 --> 40:52.620
I used to stay awake all night long,

40:52.620 --> 40:54.796
reading the same old stories about her.

40:55.564 --> 40:58.348
So much power, mystery.

40:59.819 --> 41:02.347
She could have been
the queen of all Africa.

41:02.347 --> 41:03.500
Sounds good to me.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.748
Well, the trick is proving it.

41:04.748 --> 41:06.668
And I haven't had much luck with that.

41:06.668 --> 41:09.323
Well, just 'cause you haven't found any
evidence yet doesn't mean that you won't.

41:09.323 --> 41:11.307
One has to have a little faith.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.348
What's going on?

41:18.348 --> 41:20.555
Hippos, the deadliest animal in Africa.

41:20.555 --> 41:24.683
They're highly territorial.
They'll tear us to shreds.

41:24.683 --> 41:27.788
Hippos have incredible
auditory faculties.

41:27.788 --> 41:31.915
If we remain quiet and try not to
breathe, they might leave us alone.

41:31.915 --> 41:33.995
Whoa.

41:33.995 --> 41:36.236
All right, actually, I'm
going to disagree with you.

41:36.236 --> 41:38.668
Maybe, if we sound a threatening call,

41:38.668 --> 41:41.388
we might be able to drive them off.

41:43.564 --> 41:46.700
Shut up, you idiot. We have to be quiet.

41:46.700 --> 41:48.139
No, we have to try and scare them off.

41:48.139 --> 41:49.995
We have to make noise. Be quiet!

41:49.995 --> 41:53.324
Stop, you moron. They're attacking us.

41:53.324 --> 41:56.459
It's a defensive action.
We're making progress.

42:10.796 --> 42:12.620
Hippos like chocolate.

42:23.020 --> 42:24.396
Thank you.

42:26.764 --> 42:28.459
Get out of the way.

42:47.403 --> 42:48.748
Hey, Jomo.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.555
You think maybe we could
take a little break?

42:52.555 --> 42:54.795
Just for an hour? Three, tops.

42:54.795 --> 42:56.907
We rest here for five
minutes, we eat and then we go.

42:57.963 --> 42:59.756
Yes. Anything.

43:07.979 --> 43:09.675
Come. Eat.

43:14.827 --> 43:16.875
Oh. Wow.

43:16.875 --> 43:18.379
Do you have any of
those little chocolates?

43:18.379 --> 43:19.947
Yeah. I'm way ahead of you.

43:26.028 --> 43:27.435
My drawings.

43:28.460 --> 43:30.188
I don't believe it.

43:30.188 --> 43:32.075
My mom.

43:32.075 --> 43:36.363
She must have snuck them in
my bag when I wasn't looking.

43:36.363 --> 43:38.187
You still live with your mother.

43:38.187 --> 43:40.428
What? Who, me? No.

43:40.428 --> 43:43.179
No, no. Not anymore.
I mean, I moved out.

43:43.179 --> 43:45.419
No, I got my own apartment now.

43:47.756 --> 43:49.899
Yeah, I know. It's a
little embarrassing.

43:49.899 --> 43:53.228
Don't worry. I slept at
home all through grad school.

43:56.875 --> 43:58.187
May I?

43:58.187 --> 43:59.436
Yeah.

44:02.027 --> 44:04.555
Well, you're no
Picasso, that's for sure.

44:04.555 --> 44:06.860
Give me a break. I was 8 years old.

44:07.435 --> 44:08.555
Still.

44:11.243 --> 44:12.364
Okay.

44:14.859 --> 44:16.235
Time to go.

44:20.779 --> 44:22.443
So what are those drawings of, anyway?

44:22.443 --> 44:23.948
Bedtime stories.

44:23.948 --> 44:26.220
My dad used to tell me
these silly bedtime stories,

44:26.220 --> 44:27.628
and I would draw them for him.

44:27.628 --> 44:30.347
I bet he appreciated that.

44:30.347 --> 44:32.363
I guess. I never really knew my dad.

44:32.363 --> 44:34.444
He died when I was young.

44:34.444 --> 44:36.684
He got mugged coming home from work,

44:37.996 --> 44:40.268
and the coward shot him.

44:40.268 --> 44:42.347
Never even caught who did it.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.683
Oh, I'm sorry, Flynn.

44:44.683 --> 44:48.459
Unfortunately, those silly bedtime
stories are all I have left.

44:50.283 --> 44:52.715
My father never read me bedtime stories.

44:52.715 --> 44:56.076
He was always too busy working
or fighting with my mother.

44:56.076 --> 44:58.315
I never talked to him growing up.

44:58.315 --> 45:00.907
And he's still alive, and
I still don't talk to him.

45:02.956 --> 45:07.723
Seems to me, you had a good father.

45:32.556 --> 45:35.467
You see? Gedi Province.

45:37.547 --> 45:39.147
Now what?

45:39.147 --> 45:43.595
Now we have to look for something
called the Breasts of Sheba

45:43.595 --> 45:45.355
or the All-seeing Eye.

45:45.355 --> 45:46.827
Whatever that means.

45:51.019 --> 45:53.420
I think I found the Breasts of Sheba.

45:56.075 --> 45:58.155
See the two mountains there?

45:58.155 --> 46:00.204
See how they kind of resemble the...

46:01.035 --> 46:02.763
Well, the...

46:03.436 --> 46:05.067
I get it, Flynn.

46:12.268 --> 46:14.348
They told me there's a mystic
shop in the next village

46:14.348 --> 46:16.108
run by a fortune teller.

46:16.108 --> 46:17.995
There we will find the All-seeing Eye.

46:17.995 --> 46:21.324
Thank you for everything.
You were a huge help.

46:21.324 --> 46:22.988
It is over?

46:22.988 --> 46:25.099
Yeah, we're just gonna go into
town and grab that map legend piece,

46:25.099 --> 46:28.140
head on home, so, I think
we can take it from here.

46:28.140 --> 46:29.964
I have not yet repaid my debt to you.

46:29.964 --> 46:31.628
Sure you have. You brought us here.

46:31.628 --> 46:35.564
You saved us from the hippos and
didn't make us eat the termites.

46:36.684 --> 46:37.996
I think we're even.

46:38.475 --> 46:39.627
Go well.

46:43.596 --> 46:44.779
We will.

47:14.859 --> 47:16.427
The All-seeing Eye.
The All-seeing Eye.

47:26.667 --> 47:28.524
May I help you?

47:28.524 --> 47:29.803
Are you the owner of this shop?

47:29.803 --> 47:32.139
Yes. Come in, please.

47:34.155 --> 47:35.819
It's okay. Go ahead.

47:41.899 --> 47:43.595
The store belonged to my father.

47:43.595 --> 47:45.675
It was his pride and joy.

47:45.675 --> 47:47.083
Where is your father now?

47:47.083 --> 47:48.459
He died.

47:48.459 --> 47:50.475
Not too long ago.

47:50.475 --> 47:53.836
It was my father's dying wish
that I continue his legacy.

47:53.836 --> 47:56.235
So, I inherited the store from him.

47:56.235 --> 47:59.244
Well, they say the
secrets shall be passed.

48:00.300 --> 48:02.059
Indeed, they shall.

48:02.583 --> 48:05.527
Among other things.

48:07.607 --> 48:10.199
I received this from a
Cryptic Mason in Morocco.

48:10.199 --> 48:12.664
He told me I could find
the other half to it here.

48:16.951 --> 48:20.791
Finally, the key to King Solomon Mines.

48:24.503 --> 48:26.071
The other half?

48:26.071 --> 48:28.119
Yes. It's here.

48:28.119 --> 48:31.383
Unfortunately, my
father, God rest his soul,

48:31.383 --> 48:34.839
he passed away before he could
reveal its hidden location.

48:34.839 --> 48:39.671
But, perhaps, you could
help me search for it?

48:44.087 --> 48:45.527
Thank you.

49:04.407 --> 49:05.623
Hmm?

49:06.903 --> 49:08.759
What do we have in here?

49:11.703 --> 49:14.071
What the... It's my drawing.

49:14.071 --> 49:16.823
You found something?

49:19.447 --> 49:21.943
Well, there's something
hidden inside this wall.

49:28.407 --> 49:29.719
What the...

49:41.239 --> 49:43.511
It's the other half of the map legend.

49:48.887 --> 49:50.071
What are you doing?

49:50.071 --> 49:52.791
He's one of them. A bad guy.

49:52.791 --> 49:55.031
Run, run, run. Go, go, go, go.

50:00.407 --> 50:01.719
No. We'll have to jump.

50:01.719 --> 50:03.191
Are you nuts? No, no,
no, that store awning

50:03.191 --> 50:04.951
should slow our freefall
velocity by at least 47%.

50:04.951 --> 50:06.103
34. 47%.

50:06.103 --> 50:07.831
34. Would you stop arguing with me?

50:07.831 --> 50:09.559
They have the legend. Go! Get them!

50:23.223 --> 50:24.631
They have the map!

51:26.839 --> 51:28.023
Flynn.

51:30.423 --> 51:33.623
Uncle Jerry? What are you doing here?

51:33.623 --> 51:35.447
I'm on my way to Mombasa
to pick up some exports.

51:35.447 --> 51:36.567
What are you doing here?

51:36.567 --> 51:38.327
Uh, we're in a little bit of trouble.

51:38.327 --> 51:40.663
We gotta get out of
here. Can you help us?

51:40.663 --> 51:43.127
I've got some cabins
on the train, get on.

51:53.431 --> 51:56.599
Go. Find them! Now!

51:58.231 --> 52:00.279
They're on the train!

52:00.279 --> 52:02.359
Those look like General Samir's men.

52:02.359 --> 52:04.727
You're lucky you ran
into me when you did.

52:04.727 --> 52:06.359
General Samir?

52:06.359 --> 52:10.551
He the head of a militia around
these parts. Very dangerous.

52:11.671 --> 52:15.351
Look, Flynn, these are
very unstable lands.

52:15.351 --> 52:18.071
It's no time to be caught
in the middle of a war.

52:18.071 --> 52:19.287
Too late.

52:33.047 --> 52:34.679
Come in.

52:34.679 --> 52:36.759
Hey, you about
ready for--for...

52:41.143 --> 52:44.471
That's a native Masai dress, I believe.

52:45.399 --> 52:46.807
Yes, it is.

52:47.927 --> 52:50.359
Your uncle Jerry gave it to me.

52:52.983 --> 52:54.647
Do you like it?

52:54.647 --> 52:55.991
Yeah, it's not bad.

52:58.263 --> 53:01.271
Shall we, before it gets cold?

53:05.463 --> 53:10.039
Yep, so, we had this book
signing packed with people,

53:10.039 --> 53:12.471
and Flynn, this little
9-year-old in short pants,

53:12.471 --> 53:15.287
walks up to the author and
starts arguing with him,

53:15.287 --> 53:16.951
telling him his book is all wrong.

53:16.951 --> 53:20.184
The man's thesis was unsound,
I was just pointing it out.

53:20.184 --> 53:23.703
It was Stephen Hawking. A 9-year-old
does not argue with Stephen Hawking.

53:23.703 --> 53:25.623
The man's a genius. Well, now...

53:31.191 --> 53:32.407
One moment, sir.

53:32.407 --> 53:35.319
Not for me. This has
gone straight to my head.

53:35.319 --> 53:38.391
And I shall be retiring to my cabin.

53:41.623 --> 53:44.279
Thank you for my dress.

53:53.079 --> 53:54.647
Oops!

53:54.647 --> 53:55.927
Careful.

53:59.383 --> 54:00.791
So, what are you gonna do next?

54:00.791 --> 54:04.119
You going after this
King Solomon's treasure,

54:04.119 --> 54:05.463
whatever you said it was?

54:05.463 --> 54:06.807
I don't know yet.

54:06.807 --> 54:08.631
I think you should
come to Mombasa with me.

54:08.631 --> 54:09.911
Your mother would have a heart attack

54:09.911 --> 54:11.959
if she knew what you were up to.

54:14.200 --> 54:15.767
Flynn, are you all right? Sir, your tej.

54:16.791 --> 54:18.711
Yeah, yeah.

54:18.711 --> 54:21.367
You know, I was just thinking about Dad.

54:23.223 --> 54:25.623
You guys knew each other
pretty well, didn't you?

54:25.623 --> 54:29.143
Well, he was my best
friend. I'd like to think so.

54:29.143 --> 54:33.111
Is it possible that he
could've had a secret life?

54:33.111 --> 54:35.831
Secret? You mean like you?

54:40.247 --> 54:43.863
Well, we all have our secrets, Flynn.

54:45.879 --> 54:48.247
I guess your dad was no different.

54:49.879 --> 54:51.831
Take this amulet.

54:51.831 --> 54:54.583
He was wearing this
when I first met him.

54:54.583 --> 54:57.207
And I don't think I
ever saw him take it off.

54:57.207 --> 54:59.863
He told Mom he got that
at a secondhand shop.

54:59.863 --> 55:04.023
Your dad did tell me that he
was given this by his father,

55:04.023 --> 55:07.191
who got it from his father
before him and on down the line.

55:08.311 --> 55:11.479
This amulet is part of your legacy.

55:12.567 --> 55:14.871
Passed on from generation to generation.

55:14.871 --> 55:17.111
The secret shall be passed.

55:20.087 --> 55:22.359
Flynn, what are you mixed up in?

55:25.463 --> 55:27.991
Thank you for everything, Uncle Jerry.

55:32.887 --> 55:35.991
Oh. Hey.

55:35.991 --> 55:39.383
I was, uh, just going over
the map and legend pieces.

55:39.383 --> 55:40.887
Trying to figure them out.

55:41.623 --> 55:42.871
Any luck?

55:42.871 --> 55:45.591
Well, I connected the two
pieces of the map legend.

55:45.591 --> 55:47.639
And I deciphered the markings.

55:47.639 --> 55:49.431
They reference the Old
Testament. Specifically the...

55:49.431 --> 55:51.127
Song of Solomon.

55:52.727 --> 55:54.839
How do you know?

55:54.839 --> 55:56.759
I cracked the Akon cipher last night.

55:59.127 --> 56:00.151
You did?

56:00.151 --> 56:01.527
It wasn't that hard, actually.

56:01.527 --> 56:03.287
It just the Egyptian lined equation,

56:03.287 --> 56:06.999
with a multi-varied calculus thrown in.

56:06.999 --> 56:08.407
Don't know what I was thinking.

56:08.407 --> 56:10.999
Why didn't you tell
me you figured it out?

56:10.999 --> 56:13.591
If you know the cipher, then
you don't need me anymore.

56:13.591 --> 56:16.311
Well, I guess I just
liked having you around.

56:20.727 --> 56:23.543
So, the Song of Solomon.

56:24.823 --> 56:27.319
What does a series of love poems

56:27.319 --> 56:29.719
from the Bible have to do with this map?

56:29.719 --> 56:30.871
May I?

56:32.023 --> 56:33.687
Maybe this holds the answer.

56:33.687 --> 56:36.407
Maybe we're supposed to use
this somehow to read the map.

56:36.407 --> 56:39.159
It has a purpose. I
don't know what it is.

56:48.279 --> 56:50.007
You can let go now.

56:51.063 --> 56:52.151
Okay.

56:54.423 --> 56:58.839
The Song of Solomon
mentions kissing, doesn't it?

56:58.839 --> 57:00.183
I think so.

57:01.400 --> 57:04.151
"Let him kiss me with his mouth

57:04.151 --> 57:08.663
"for thy kisses are sweeter than gold."

57:10.040 --> 57:11.287
Wine.

57:11.671 --> 57:13.303
What?

57:13.303 --> 57:16.471
"Thy kisses are sweeter
than wine." You said gold.

57:16.471 --> 57:17.943
That's because I'm
pretty sure it is gold.

57:17.943 --> 57:20.151
And I'm pretty sure
it's wine. No, it's gold.

57:20.151 --> 57:21.271
Wine. It's gold.

57:21.873 --> 57:23.089
Wine!

57:28.626 --> 57:31.250
And to think that I came that
close to falling for somebody

57:31.250 --> 57:33.074
who can't stop correcting
me every second of the day.

57:33.074 --> 57:34.769
I only correct you
every second of the day

57:34.769 --> 57:36.754
because you're wrong
every second of the day!

57:36.754 --> 57:40.402
I was reciting poetry! I
was trying to be romantic.

57:40.402 --> 57:42.129
Romance isn't about being shot at,

57:42.129 --> 57:44.145
being bloody dragged across Africa.

57:44.721 --> 57:47.985
It's about music

57:49.586 --> 57:51.666
and chocolates and flowers and...

57:51.666 --> 57:53.169
Say that again.

57:55.506 --> 57:58.801
It's about music and chocolates and...

57:58.801 --> 58:01.649
Music. That's it!

58:01.649 --> 58:03.026
I can't believe I
didn't see that before.

58:03.026 --> 58:04.209
It's so easy, it's so obvious.

58:04.209 --> 58:05.681
Don't you get it?

58:05.681 --> 58:09.489
The Song of Solomon is
literally the song of Solomon.

58:09.489 --> 58:10.801
This isn't a map.

58:10.801 --> 58:15.089
This is sheet music.

58:18.673 --> 58:20.049
That legend...

58:20.049 --> 58:22.353
...is an instrument
used to play the notes.

58:25.970 --> 58:28.242
Thank God for clarinet lessons.

58:30.193 --> 58:33.361
Nope. Sorry. One more time.

59:00.209 --> 59:02.225
Did you see that? Uh-huh.

59:02.225 --> 59:04.626
Three Witches Mountain.

59:04.626 --> 59:08.081
The mines are inside that mountain.

59:08.081 --> 59:10.321
You do have your moments, Flynn Carson.

59:16.785 --> 59:21.041
Uh, Flynn, are you
there? Come in, Flynn.

59:23.761 --> 59:25.201
Okay, this is too much.

59:25.201 --> 59:26.641
Is there something I can help you with?

59:26.641 --> 59:28.561
Did you retrieve the map legend?

59:28.561 --> 59:30.290
Yes. And the map also.

59:30.290 --> 59:34.481
The location of King
Solomon's Mines is safe?

59:34.481 --> 59:38.609
All right. Grab the first plane
out and return to the library.

59:38.609 --> 59:41.233
I'm not coming home right away,
Judson. I'm going to the Mines.

59:41.233 --> 59:42.961
It's dangerous, Flynn.

59:42.961 --> 59:45.393
I mean, if the Key of Solomon
should fall into the wrong hands...

59:45.393 --> 59:46.705
It won't, okay?

59:46.705 --> 59:49.554
Listen, why don't you
just trust me one time?

59:49.554 --> 59:51.153
I don't have any choice. I have to go.

59:51.153 --> 59:54.673
Just remember that sometimes
you have to give up what you want

59:54.673 --> 59:55.729
for the greater good.

59:55.729 --> 59:57.586
Okay, I gotta go. Take care.

01:00:00.241 --> 01:00:03.633
I just wish you'd reconsider
and come back to Mombasa with me.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.066
Leave this treasure hunting
to the professionals.

01:00:06.066 --> 01:00:07.953
I'll be fine, Uncle Jerry.

01:00:07.953 --> 01:00:09.810
Morning. Hello.

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:12.242
What do you have there?

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:14.385
Oh, just some stuff
that I picked up in town.

01:00:14.385 --> 01:00:16.049
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:16.049 --> 01:00:18.513
And I thought that you didn't
believe in King Solomon's Mines.

01:00:18.513 --> 01:00:22.129
I don't. It's just standard
hiking gear in case we need it.

01:00:22.129 --> 01:00:23.346
Uh-huh.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:27.442
I guess you better be going.

01:00:27.442 --> 01:00:29.809
Hey, thank you for everything.

01:00:30.609 --> 01:00:32.785
You be careful, kiddo.

01:00:32.785 --> 01:00:34.961
You too, gorgeous. Goodbye.

01:00:58.993 --> 01:01:01.841
Now I know why this
place seems so familiar.

01:01:02.641 --> 01:01:04.465
I've been here before.

01:01:04.913 --> 01:01:06.161
You have?

01:01:06.866 --> 01:01:08.114
Yeah.

01:01:11.281 --> 01:01:13.393
My father's bedtime stories.

01:01:18.834 --> 01:01:20.785
This is the place he was talking about.

01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:23.761
The laughing rocks.

01:01:26.002 --> 01:01:28.113
He was here.

01:01:28.113 --> 01:01:30.706
And he knew that one
day I would be here, too.

01:01:35.602 --> 01:01:37.713
He was preparing me for it.

01:01:39.793 --> 01:01:42.673
Well, I guess these
aren't useless after all.

01:01:44.465 --> 01:01:48.561
Timber, wood, tree. The baobab tree.

01:01:48.561 --> 01:01:50.066
The oldest tree in Africa.

01:01:50.066 --> 01:01:52.530
Over 3,000 years old.

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:55.410
That would put it around
the time of Solomon.

01:02:03.985 --> 01:02:05.393
That's hollow.

01:02:37.873 --> 01:02:41.202
We must, uh, we must be
underneath the mountain now.

01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:45.361
Watch your step going through here.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:46.962
This ground is very, very...

01:02:48.274 --> 01:02:50.034
Flynn?

01:02:53.266 --> 01:02:54.961
Flynn, you all right?

01:02:55.954 --> 01:02:57.329
Slippery.

01:02:57.329 --> 01:03:00.273
I was going to say the
ground is very slippery.

01:03:00.946 --> 01:03:02.705
Where are we?

01:03:02.705 --> 01:03:04.529
Turn off the flashlight.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:10.769
Desmodus rotundus. Vampire bats.

01:03:10.769 --> 01:03:13.969
Filthy, disgusting vampire bats.

01:03:13.969 --> 01:03:16.945
Yeah, they're sensitive to light.
We don't want to disturb them.

01:03:20.402 --> 01:03:22.130
Hello. What is this?

01:03:26.129 --> 01:03:28.049
I think I'm gonna hurl.

01:03:28.049 --> 01:03:29.810
Oh, please. Come on.

01:03:37.873 --> 01:03:39.793
We have to cross that?

01:03:39.793 --> 01:03:42.193
If I remember the map correctly,
that should be the entrance

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:43.602
to King Solomon's treasure chamber.

01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:45.393
So, yes.

01:04:12.242 --> 01:04:14.226
Piece of cake.

01:04:14.226 --> 01:04:15.825
Okay. Okay.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.363
This is it?

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:36.155
Where's the book?

01:04:37.979 --> 01:04:40.603
Where's the treasure?

01:04:40.603 --> 01:04:43.323
What kind of treasure chamber
doesn't have any treasure?

01:04:48.156 --> 01:04:52.315
Wasting so much time
chasing myths and legends.

01:04:53.979 --> 01:04:56.731
I actually believed that
I might find something.

01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:58.204
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:01.404 --> 01:05:06.715
Instead, I've been
practically killed by a madman.

01:05:06.715 --> 01:05:08.091
And hippos.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:23.099
You had the key with you all this time.

01:05:34.492 --> 01:05:36.924
Okay, just go, just go. Just go.

01:06:00.795 --> 01:06:02.523
Now do you believe that?

01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:14.620
Oh, my.

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:17.756
The Book of Genesis.

01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:21.084
I'm holding the Book of Genesis.

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:26.043
Dead Sea Scrolls, every
single one of them.

01:06:32.092 --> 01:06:33.435
Sheba.

01:06:42.619 --> 01:06:44.411
The Book of Solomon.

01:07:21.531 --> 01:07:22.811
Flynn?

01:07:25.756 --> 01:07:27.099
Flynn!

01:07:30.523 --> 01:07:32.476
I think we should be going.

01:07:38.299 --> 01:07:41.691
Give me the book. Give it to me.

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.196
Look who it is.

01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:53.723
Jerry.

01:07:57.692 --> 01:07:59.356
Stop. Stop. I'll give you the book.

01:07:59.356 --> 01:08:01.276
Just don't hurt him anymore.

01:08:02.652 --> 01:08:04.091
Sorry, Flynn,

01:08:05.243 --> 01:08:08.700
but I told you not to
come here, didn't I?

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.003
You bastard. You work for them.

01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:13.660
Oh, you've got it backwards,
darling. They work for me.

01:08:15.195 --> 01:08:17.243
Jerry! What did I say?

01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:19.835
"Leave the treasure hunting
to the professionals."

01:08:19.835 --> 01:08:21.500
But, no, you had to come here.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.260
How'd you find out about the Mines?

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.131
I begged your father to tell
me where it was, but he refused.

01:08:27.131 --> 01:08:28.603
He was so stubborn.

01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:32.314
He kept refusing, right up
until the moment I shot him.

01:08:32.314 --> 01:08:34.042
You shot my father?

01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:38.011
He was your best friend.

01:08:38.011 --> 01:08:42.234
I hated him for taking
your mother away from me.

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:45.243
I hated him for having
the family I never had.

01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:48.124
Your father had everything
and I had nothing!

01:08:49.532 --> 01:08:52.475
The power of this book
will change all that.

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:56.122
With it I can bend space and time

01:08:56.122 --> 01:08:58.715
and take back all
that's rightfully mine.

01:08:58.715 --> 01:09:02.042
I can rewrite my own history.

01:09:02.042 --> 01:09:04.796
No, you can't use that book.
You know how dangerous it is.

01:09:04.796 --> 01:09:07.962
The incantation must be
read in a special chamber

01:09:07.962 --> 01:09:09.915
here in the Mines.

01:09:09.915 --> 01:09:13.180
What a shame. You're gonna miss it.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.939
What, are you going
to kill us, too, Jerry?

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:19.738
You're like a son to me,
Flynn. I could never kill you.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:22.299
I've got General Samir
to do that for me.

01:09:22.299 --> 01:09:24.796
Oh, you better hope he does.

01:09:24.796 --> 01:09:26.716
Just make sure they don't suffer...

01:09:26.716 --> 01:09:27.996
much.

01:09:36.283 --> 01:09:39.291
It would be so easy to shoot you both,

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:41.850
but this would be so much more fun.

01:09:48.252 --> 01:09:49.724
Here, try this.

01:10:05.088 --> 01:10:06.048
We're going to drown!

01:10:07.483 --> 01:10:08.764
What are you doing?

01:10:08.764 --> 01:10:09.980
I'm looking for a secret chamber!

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.092
Enough with the secret chambers already!

01:10:12.092 --> 01:10:13.916
We are going to die!

01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:15.484
Why don't you think of something?

01:10:15.648 --> 01:10:17.568
You're the one with 25 PhDs!

01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:22.847
Help! Help!

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.075
Help!

01:10:26.075 --> 01:10:27.643
Help!

01:10:27.643 --> 01:10:28.859
Help!

01:10:55.612 --> 01:11:00.539
"By all the other names of God
Almighty, we powerfully command ye..."

01:11:00.768 --> 01:11:03.167
Help!

01:11:09.244 --> 01:11:10.812
We'll be crushed to death!

01:11:10.812 --> 01:11:12.763
I'd say we're probably
going to drown first.

01:11:12.763 --> 01:11:14.971
The water level's rising
much faster than...

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:16.476
Shut up!

01:11:16.476 --> 01:11:17.884
Save your oxygen.

01:11:18.048 --> 01:11:20.447
I'm going to try the grate again.

01:11:24.287 --> 01:11:28.127
Flynn! Flynn! Flynn!

01:11:36.288 --> 01:11:37.727
Flynn!

01:11:50.688 --> 01:11:53.568
I was, uh, I was never
very good at this.

01:11:54.716 --> 01:11:56.475
Am I dead?

01:11:56.475 --> 01:11:58.524
Do you-- do
you want to be?

01:11:58.524 --> 01:12:00.892
Good, good. Then you're not.

01:12:00.892 --> 01:12:04.220
Oh. Oh, there we go. That's better.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.603
Only you, Flynn, can
protect Solomon's secrets.

01:12:08.603 --> 01:12:10.651
It's your legacy.

01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:13.083
You must follow in
your father's footsteps.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:14.395
I don't understand.

01:12:14.688 --> 01:12:15.648
You will.

01:12:19.163 --> 01:12:22.043
Now, I need you to do
one more thing for me.

01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:23.807
What's that? Open your eyes.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:33.851
Jomo. Jomo.

01:12:33.888 --> 01:12:35.327
Now we are even.

01:12:47.807 --> 01:12:52.128
"By all the other names of God
Almighty, we powerfully command ye."

01:12:52.924 --> 01:12:54.556
Where are we?

01:12:54.556 --> 01:12:56.603
We're in the Chamber of the Dead Kings.

01:12:56.603 --> 01:12:57.755
What's he doing?

01:12:57.755 --> 01:12:59.323
He's reading the Grimorian Incantation

01:12:59.323 --> 01:13:01.532
that will allow the dead to rise.

01:13:01.532 --> 01:13:03.003
Is that bad?

01:13:03.003 --> 01:13:04.891
Well, it's not good.

01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:07.963
If the spirits enter the Altar of
the Flame, it's not gonna be pretty.

01:13:07.963 --> 01:13:09.244
Here's the plan.

01:13:09.244 --> 01:13:11.099
We're going to draw
them out one at a time

01:13:11.099 --> 01:13:13.019
and concentrate all
their power in the center.

01:13:13.019 --> 01:13:15.260
Then we go right, we go
left, then we take the front.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.923
Brilliant. Thank you.

01:13:16.923 --> 01:13:18.683
Have you considered the Boris
Spassky defense could be simpler?

01:13:18.683 --> 01:13:20.572
Don't you...

01:13:20.572 --> 01:13:22.555
"Ye who by your own..."

01:13:22.847 --> 01:13:24.287
That works, too.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.523
"...before His throne by Him who had

01:13:38.687 --> 01:13:41.087
"cast ye down unto the most profound..."

01:13:55.487 --> 01:13:58.847
I should have shot you
when I had the chance.

01:14:01.247 --> 01:14:02.207
Get the book.

01:14:16.127 --> 01:14:18.047
"Open the portal, and ye...

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.847
"Let the gateway appear...

01:14:42.043 --> 01:14:46.172
"O Great One, strong and powerful,

01:14:46.172 --> 01:14:50.524
"rise from your sleep so that
you may aid me in my work.

01:14:50.524 --> 01:14:54.075
"Come ye. Come ye, angels of darkness.

01:14:54.527 --> 01:14:57.887
"Come hither before this
circle without fear and terror."

01:15:14.043 --> 01:15:17.084
"Long before the
constitution of the world,

01:15:17.084 --> 01:15:20.443
"by the names of the true
princes of the universe,

01:15:20.443 --> 01:15:23.772
"by the rod of Moses,
by the staff of Jacob,

01:15:23.772 --> 01:15:26.075
"by the ring and seal of David,

01:15:26.075 --> 01:15:29.499
"wherein are writ the
names of sovereign God,

01:15:29.499 --> 01:15:32.795
"I conjure thee, O creatures of fire,

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:35.355
"open the portal.

01:15:35.807 --> 01:15:39.647
"Go to the light and grant my desire."

01:15:54.047 --> 01:15:57.407
Ghosts. I hate ghosts.

01:16:06.047 --> 01:16:08.447
I can hear you breathing.

01:16:16.607 --> 01:16:18.527
I'm going to kill you.

01:16:24.283 --> 01:16:27.324
"...and before the tribunal
of the judgment of His Majesty,

01:16:27.324 --> 01:16:29.500
"and before the holy angels of darkness

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.155
"hear the sentence of your condemnation.

01:16:32.319 --> 01:16:33.759
"Come ye then."

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:38.079
It's working. It's working.

01:16:53.723 --> 01:16:58.812
"Which the very spirit of God hath
moved, by the sun and by the stars,

01:16:58.812 --> 01:17:02.140
"by the waters, by the sea
and all which they contain,

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:04.955
"by the whirlwinds and the tempests,

01:17:04.955 --> 01:17:08.156
"O demons, aid me in my work.

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:11.323
"I conjure ye anew by
these other names of God.

01:17:11.323 --> 01:17:13.851
"Both holy and unknown.

01:17:14.079 --> 01:17:16.959
"Now grant me the power of Solomon!"

01:17:28.959 --> 01:17:32.319
You should be back at your
stuffy job, stacking books.

01:17:36.639 --> 01:17:39.519
You'd be surprised what you
can learn at the library.

01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:07.164
Give me the book.

01:18:07.164 --> 01:18:08.955
Don't come any closer
or I'll destroy it.

01:18:09.279 --> 01:18:11.679
You wouldn't dare. Flynn, don't.

01:18:13.119 --> 01:18:15.039
Imagine the power, Flynn.

01:18:16.476 --> 01:18:20.412
You could control all space and time,

01:18:20.412 --> 01:18:23.132
make your wildest dreams come true.

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:24.731
I don't care about any of that.

01:18:25.119 --> 01:18:27.039
You could see your father again!

01:18:30.843 --> 01:18:32.923
Use the book, Flynn.

01:18:32.923 --> 01:18:35.164
Finish reading the incantations,

01:18:35.679 --> 01:18:38.559
and bring your father back to you.

01:18:42.011 --> 01:18:43.900
He would put that on and tell you

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.043
the most extraordinary bedtime stories

01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:51.039
about magical kingdoms and
with upside-down valleys.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.251
Yes.

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.239
Read the words.

01:19:00.859 --> 01:19:02.140
Read it.

01:19:02.559 --> 01:19:04.959
"Bless O Lord, all-powerful
and all-merciful..."

01:19:07.359 --> 01:19:11.199
Bring him back to you. That's it.

01:19:12.443 --> 01:19:14.459
Read the words.

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:17.371
"This creature of fire, so
that, being blessed by thee,

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.799
"it may be for the honor and
glory of thy most holy name.

01:19:31.739 --> 01:19:34.076
"I conjure thee, O creature of fire,

01:19:34.076 --> 01:19:36.635
"by Him who removeth the
Earth and maketh it tremble

01:19:36.635 --> 01:19:38.780
"and now burn and torment these spirits

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.635
"so that they may feel it intensely,

01:19:40.635 --> 01:19:43.132
"that they may be
burned eternally by thee,

01:19:43.132 --> 01:19:45.819
"I exorcize thee, O creature of fire."

01:19:45.819 --> 01:19:48.411
Flynn? Stop!

01:19:48.411 --> 01:19:50.460
Don't you see what you're doing?

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.636
"That they may work no hindrance
or evil unto those who use it.

01:19:52.636 --> 01:19:54.971
"Through thee, O eternal
and almighty Lord,

01:19:54.971 --> 01:19:59.100
"through thy most holy name, bring
back those I've loved and lost."

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:03.007
"Bring my father to me."

01:20:09.246 --> 01:20:10.206
No.

01:20:13.567 --> 01:20:15.487
Don't do it. No.

01:20:18.367 --> 01:20:20.287
What are you doing?

01:20:20.764 --> 01:20:23.100
No, no! No! Don't do it. Stop! Read it!

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.851
Don't you want to be
with your father again?

01:20:26.526 --> 01:20:28.446
My father has been
with me the whole time.

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:32.859
No!

01:20:53.887 --> 01:20:57.246
Flynn, get out of there!

01:21:30.846 --> 01:21:32.766
You can let go now.

01:21:52.091 --> 01:21:54.044
Jomo, I don't know how to thank you.

01:21:54.044 --> 01:21:55.835
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:21:55.835 --> 01:21:58.492
I have been your guide, but
it was you who led the way.

01:21:58.492 --> 01:22:01.211
I have a little something for you.

01:22:01.211 --> 01:22:03.452
No. No, no, no. That belongs to you.

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:06.047
No, this belongs to you.

01:22:06.363 --> 01:22:08.475
I can't think of anybody
I would rather have

01:22:08.475 --> 01:22:11.195
protect King Solomon's secret than you.

01:22:11.807 --> 01:22:13.727
I have something for you.

01:22:17.086 --> 01:22:19.006
In case of hippos. In case of hippos.

01:22:25.276 --> 01:22:28.475
Next time I'm in Kenya, I'll be
sure to stop by the Nulu tribe.

01:22:28.475 --> 01:22:30.876
I will treat you like a queen.

01:22:31.486 --> 01:22:33.887
A queen? Did you hear that?

01:22:34.235 --> 01:22:36.092
Finally some respect.

01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:42.046
Flight 382 now boarding to New York.

01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:51.835
You want to be treated like a queen,

01:22:52.606 --> 01:22:54.526
wait till my mother meets you.

01:22:56.446 --> 01:22:58.366
This is our plane right over here.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:03.166
I'm not going.

01:23:05.086 --> 01:23:07.487
I booked a flight to Tunisia instead.

01:23:10.075 --> 01:23:11.643
You did?

01:23:11.643 --> 01:23:13.276
There's a dig there.

01:23:13.276 --> 01:23:15.483
They found some
first-century pottery shards

01:23:15.483 --> 01:23:17.659
that could be linked to Sheba.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.003
It's a shot in the dark.

01:23:19.967 --> 01:23:22.366
Thought you were all done
chasing myths and legends.

01:23:24.286 --> 01:23:27.166
Yeah, well, let's just say
I got a little inspiration.

01:23:31.487 --> 01:23:32.926
So, this is it?

01:23:35.327 --> 01:23:36.766
I guess so.

01:23:37.595 --> 01:23:40.316
Well, I'm not very good at goodbyes.

01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:42.140
Neither am I. I'm really
not very good at goodbyes.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.731
I'm really not good, either. Well,
I think I'm a little worse at them...

01:23:45.406 --> 01:23:46.847
Flynn?

01:23:55.006 --> 01:23:56.926
Will I see you again?

01:23:59.327 --> 01:24:01.247
One has to have a little faith.

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:31.007
"Of all the gin joints in all the world

01:24:34.366 --> 01:24:36.767
she had to walk into mine."

01:24:53.211 --> 01:24:57.179
$500 to the Magical Honeymoon Tour?

01:24:57.179 --> 01:24:58.619
Oh, which reminds me.

01:24:58.619 --> 01:24:59.931
Your mother called.

01:24:59.931 --> 01:25:01.435
She sounded furious.

01:25:01.435 --> 01:25:04.923
Something about you getting
married and not telling her?

01:25:06.046 --> 01:25:07.006
Don't ask.

01:25:07.388 --> 01:25:08.347
Okay.

01:25:08.926 --> 01:25:10.846
Itemize these next time, will you?

01:25:12.287 --> 01:25:14.207
I'm glad you're home.

01:25:25.727 --> 01:25:27.166
Excalibur?

01:25:34.653 --> 01:25:38.492
Oh. Oh, Flynn, I--I
didn't know you were back.

01:25:38.492 --> 01:25:39.675
Judson.

01:25:39.675 --> 01:25:41.211
So, how did your trip go?

01:25:41.211 --> 01:25:44.091
Oh, not so well.

01:25:44.091 --> 01:25:47.804
Destroyed the book, which
wasn't very librarian of me.

01:25:47.804 --> 01:25:51.996
You sacrificed what you really
wanted for the greater good.

01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:55.099
Only a great librarian would do that.

01:25:55.099 --> 01:25:58.556
What about your father? Did you
find all the answers you wanted?

01:25:59.327 --> 01:26:00.766
Yeah.

01:26:01.755 --> 01:26:03.516
But I think you knew that already.

01:26:31.007 --> 01:26:32.446
eBay.

01:26:57.887 --> 01:27:00.286
I didn't say anything
about flying kites.

01:27:01.727 --> 01:27:02.687
Oh.

01:27:08.447 --> 01:27:10.367
You have got to tell
me how you did that.
