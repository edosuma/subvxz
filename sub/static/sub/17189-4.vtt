WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:02.890
Bashira. That's a lovely name. I'm Molly.

00:02.940 --> 00:05.530
You do not involve yourself
in the lives of the locals.

00:05.580 --> 00:08.610
Her father, Badrai, sent her to spy.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.450
We're soul sisters.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.090
Am I going to die?

00:12.140 --> 00:13.690
Move!

00:13.740 --> 00:15.330
Where have they taken her, Sir?

00:15.380 --> 00:17.970
They're willing to help
facilitate the removal of Bashira

00:18.020 --> 00:20.210
from her family and into
a safe house in Kabul.

00:20.260 --> 00:21.810
Come back to me.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.810
I will.

00:23.860 --> 00:25.490
Fate's thrown us together.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.050
Captain James?

00:27.100 --> 00:29.170
Me and you.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.770
Why can't you just be my mate?

00:30.870 --> 00:33.060
Because I love you.

00:33.110 --> 00:34.900
Nothing happened with Smurf.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.700
But at least now I know.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.780
What are you trying to say, Dawes?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.940
Do you love me?

00:40.990 --> 00:42.780
They beat me with rocks

00:42.830 --> 00:45.660
because I wouldn't kill someone.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.190
Kill who, Sohail?

01:04.875 --> 01:09.385
Man down! Man down!

01:09.435 --> 01:12.105
One Cat A, urgent med-evac required!

01:12.155 --> 01:13.825
MIST out, wait out.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.945
Stay with me, OK? You're
going to be all right.

01:15.995 --> 01:17.465
I'm going to get you out of here,

01:17.515 --> 01:19.665
I just need you to stay with me, OK?

01:19.715 --> 01:21.785
Stay with me!

01:21.835 --> 01:23.385
Come on, stay with me!

01:23.435 --> 01:25.065
Stay with me!

01:25.115 --> 01:27.625
Just because you're tucked up
all snug and safe in Bastion,

01:27.675 --> 01:29.705
does not mean you are
no longer real soldiers!

01:29.755 --> 01:31.185
Now dig in!

01:31.235 --> 01:32.985
Give us a lift, Boss.

01:33.035 --> 01:34.905
Aw, you'd only be cheating yourself, Dawes.

01:34.955 --> 01:36.425
Oh, by the way,

01:36.475 --> 01:39.665
the last one over the finish
line is on latrine clean!

01:39.715 --> 01:41.435
Now come on!

01:46.115 --> 01:47.865
Moll, fellas,

01:47.915 --> 01:49.945
if this is all the effort
you're going to put in,

01:49.995 --> 01:52.745
we can do a 5k run every morning
and a 10k run every evening

01:52.795 --> 01:55.785
until you do not look like the
unfit rabble you look like today.

01:55.835 --> 01:58.825
Can we remember we are the British Army!

01:58.875 --> 02:00.545
The last soldier past me

02:00.595 --> 02:02.875
is going to be on latrine clean!

02:08.995 --> 02:12.115
Very clever, 2 Section, indeed.

02:13.155 --> 02:15.355
I think our work here is almost done!

02:17.915 --> 02:22.145
Oh, that backfired. My hands stink of...

02:22.195 --> 02:25.065
You know what they say, a
job shared is a job halved.

02:25.115 --> 02:28.065
Boys, I reckon we got another month
of Bastion before decompression

02:28.115 --> 02:29.785
and home, you know.

02:29.835 --> 02:32.705
I'm gutted we're pulling out,
man. I want to go on another tour.

02:32.755 --> 02:35.585
- There's still Taliban out there.
- There's still Badrai out there!

02:35.635 --> 02:37.705
Where do you reckon he's
hidden himself, Molls?

02:37.755 --> 02:39.305
What you asking me for?

02:39.355 --> 02:41.545
Oh, and all that time I
spent writing my death letter

02:41.595 --> 02:43.385
and now no-one's going
to be able to read it!

02:43.435 --> 02:44.865
You sound gutted, Mansfield!

02:44.915 --> 02:46.785
In my death letter home, yeah, I told them

02:46.835 --> 02:50.785
I wanted one of them eco-friendly
wicker casket basket thingys.

02:50.835 --> 02:52.475
Can we stop talking about dying?

02:53.595 --> 02:55.755
Me mum's shit me up enough as it is.

02:57.915 --> 02:59.345
Why?

02:59.395 --> 03:01.425
She's just wrote to me...

03:01.475 --> 03:03.665
had a premonition.

03:03.715 --> 03:06.035
Thinks something bad's going to happen.

03:11.555 --> 03:13.185
Shut up.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.785
Go to sleep.

03:14.835 --> 03:16.505
I'm being serious, boys.

03:16.555 --> 03:18.225
Chill out, Smurf, eh?

03:18.275 --> 03:19.875
She was right about Geraint.

03:51.956 --> 03:56.545
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:05.155 --> 04:06.865
You wanted to see me?

04:06.915 --> 04:09.425
Yeah, just wanted to let you
know that after Sohail's murder

04:09.475 --> 04:13.025
and other intel received, Badrai is
very much on the Americans' radar.

04:13.075 --> 04:14.145
What do you mean?

04:14.195 --> 04:15.745
They need him caught and will be doing

04:15.795 --> 04:18.785
all in their considerable power to
support the ASF and get him caught.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.985
He's pretty much at the
top of their wanted list.

04:21.035 --> 04:22.145
Really?

04:22.195 --> 04:24.435
Yeah. American Intelligence
have a dossier that...

04:26.115 --> 04:28.785
Well, it makes for pretty shocking reading.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.785
He's pretty high up in their network.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.715
He's not just some lightweight,
ten dollar Taliban. He's proper.

04:35.675 --> 04:36.825
Right.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.345
So, the boss and I have been
speaking to Major Morley...

04:39.395 --> 04:40.835
American Intelligence?

04:41.875 --> 04:44.425
Any mission will involve you.

04:44.475 --> 04:46.745
You're the only person
who's eye-balled Badrai.

04:46.795 --> 04:49.865
You'll be needed to positively ID him.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.195
You happy with that?

04:53.115 --> 04:55.225
It'll be my absolute pleasure, Boss.

04:55.275 --> 04:57.505
OK. We'll let you know when you're needed.

04:57.555 --> 05:00.995
You better go grab some breakfast
while you've got a chance.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.465
You coming to watch the volleyball?

05:17.515 --> 05:18.985
It's us against the Yanks.

05:19.035 --> 05:20.585
I dunno if I can.

05:20.635 --> 05:22.425
What you doing?

05:22.475 --> 05:25.265
Just got other duties and stuff.

05:25.315 --> 05:26.705
What other duties?

05:26.755 --> 05:28.355
Smurf, I'll come if I can.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.065
And don't worry about your mum said.

05:32.115 --> 05:34.145
You've got a face like a slapped arse.

05:34.195 --> 05:37.185
50 sausage challenge!

05:37.235 --> 05:38.625
Go on!

05:38.675 --> 05:41.265
50 sausages in 50 minutes!

05:41.315 --> 05:42.785
Come on, mate, you can do it.

05:42.835 --> 05:44.585
You ready, you ready? Three, two, one, go!

05:44.635 --> 05:46.505
You coming to watch the volleyball, Qaseem?

05:46.555 --> 05:48.265
I mean, you're basically a Brit now.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.545
No, I'm basically not.

05:49.595 --> 05:51.225
It was meant to be a compliment, mate.

05:51.275 --> 05:53.025
Really?

05:53.075 --> 05:54.625
No pleasing some people, is there?

05:54.675 --> 05:56.475
I'm very happy being an Afghan.

05:58.235 --> 05:59.945
Eggy said you're out of here.

05:59.995 --> 06:01.715
Your contract's finished.

06:02.715 --> 06:04.235
I'm going back to Kabul.

06:06.395 --> 06:07.715
Is that good?

06:09.475 --> 06:11.105
I'm ready.

06:11.155 --> 06:12.755
But is Kabul ready for you?

06:16.955 --> 06:19.705
When this is all over,

06:19.755 --> 06:21.675
can I come and visit you in Kabul?

06:23.235 --> 06:25.385
I know the subtext.

06:25.435 --> 06:27.345
I don't even know what that means.

06:27.395 --> 06:29.395
It means you want to visit Bashira.

06:31.155 --> 06:33.425
I just hope that she's all right.

06:33.475 --> 06:35.345
You never know what her dad's going to do

06:35.395 --> 06:37.425
and if he does anything
to that little girl...

06:37.475 --> 06:39.385
No, Badrai won't hurt her.

06:39.435 --> 06:41.425
You mustn't worry about Bashira.

06:41.475 --> 06:43.625
People are looking after her, I'm sure.

06:43.675 --> 06:45.225
I just want to help.

06:45.275 --> 06:46.985
You have done.

06:47.035 --> 06:49.075
- Have I?
- Yes.

06:51.595 --> 06:53.825
Oh, I don't know.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.665
Come on, Mike!

06:55.715 --> 06:57.315
Come on!

06:59.235 --> 07:00.755
Go on, lad!

07:06.195 --> 07:07.715
I'll be back in a minute.

07:12.875 --> 07:16.235
Sometimes I don't know how I'm
able to keep my hands off you.

07:21.555 --> 07:22.985
Ditto.

07:23.035 --> 07:25.625
"Ditto"? Bleeding "ditto"?

07:25.675 --> 07:28.625
I was expecting something a
bit more romantic than "ditto".

07:28.675 --> 07:30.145
We agreed we'd wait out.

07:30.195 --> 07:32.665
I am waiting out, aren't I?

07:32.715 --> 07:34.985
I'm obeying your orders, Boss.

07:35.035 --> 07:37.385
And we haven't actually
done anything, so...

07:37.435 --> 07:39.035
Well, I need to stay focused,

07:40.115 --> 07:42.665
get you guys home in one piece.

07:42.715 --> 07:44.155
You're in my charge.

07:45.675 --> 07:48.025
If this is a mistake, then just say.

07:48.075 --> 07:49.705
What do you mean, mistake?

07:49.755 --> 07:51.465
If you're regretting it...

07:51.515 --> 07:53.995
us and... me.

07:56.155 --> 07:57.625
You should get ready.

07:57.675 --> 07:59.585
They think they've located Badrai.

07:59.635 --> 08:02.115
Afghan Special Forces are waiting for you.

08:28.435 --> 08:29.665
Are you ready?

08:29.715 --> 08:31.315
I'm shitting myself, Boss.

08:32.635 --> 08:34.105
It'll be OK. I promise.

08:34.155 --> 08:35.515
I can do this on my own.

08:36.554 --> 08:38.554
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

09:34.035 --> 09:35.395
Wait out.

10:16.715 --> 10:18.195
These two?

10:36.995 --> 10:38.155
Badrai?

10:45.915 --> 10:47.265
This one?

10:47.315 --> 10:48.515
No.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.145
- It's not him.
- Please, look.

10:59.195 --> 11:01.265
It's not Badrai. He's not here, Boss.

11:06.475 --> 11:07.985
Please.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.515
Don't hurt him.

11:15.915 --> 11:17.585
Are you all right?

11:17.635 --> 11:19.185
Yeah,

11:19.235 --> 11:21.035
never been better, Boss.

11:31.515 --> 11:34.035
Well, you will go out
on these secret missions!

11:35.515 --> 11:37.585
- Jealous?
- You bet!

11:37.635 --> 11:39.225
You're off like some superhero

11:39.275 --> 11:42.185
and I'm left indoors with antiseptic
wipes to clean up afterwards.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.425
What superhero do you know that's that slow

11:44.475 --> 11:46.705
they get a clump to the cake hole?

11:46.755 --> 11:50.025
Our neighbour used to have this
little sign on his mantelpiece...

11:50.075 --> 11:53.345
"Never trouble trouble,
till trouble troubles you."

11:53.395 --> 11:54.465
Oh, right.

11:54.515 --> 11:56.985
I never knew what it meant till I met you.

11:57.035 --> 11:58.425
What does it mean?

11:58.475 --> 12:01.185
The rest of us keep our
heads down but you're like,

12:01.235 --> 12:04.065
"Oi, trouble, come and have a go
if you think you're hard enough."

12:04.115 --> 12:06.105
It ain't like that, Jack.

12:06.155 --> 12:07.865
Seems that way to me.

12:07.915 --> 12:10.345
I'd prefer to be indoors
with the antiseptic wipes

12:10.395 --> 12:12.185
but it never really works out like that.

12:12.235 --> 12:15.145
You never look for trouble but
trouble just seems to find you,

12:15.195 --> 12:16.665
eh, Molly Dawes?

12:16.715 --> 12:18.905
Exactly.

12:18.955 --> 12:23.145
Despite reliable intel on his
whereabouts, Badrai has evaded us.

12:23.195 --> 12:24.505
Again.

12:24.555 --> 12:27.225
We're about ready to start
questioning the three detainees.

12:27.275 --> 12:29.265
We'll see what intel they yield.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.665
We find him.

12:30.715 --> 12:31.785
Imperative.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.705
It's likely he has a sizeable cache
of explosives with him from the

12:34.755 --> 12:38.345
factory, which from past experience
we know he won't hesitate to use.

12:38.395 --> 12:39.745
Sir,

12:39.795 --> 12:41.985
as Dawes is the key to the successful

12:42.035 --> 12:46.065
apprehension of Badrai, can I
suggest next time a joint operation?

12:46.115 --> 12:47.755
Agreed.

12:49.065 --> 12:51.535
I can't believe he weren't there.

12:51.585 --> 12:53.055
We've just put a bomb factory

12:53.105 --> 12:54.815
and several insurgents out of action.

12:54.865 --> 12:56.455
We have.

12:56.505 --> 12:58.385
Now let's complete the mission.

13:06.985 --> 13:08.375
Moll?

13:08.425 --> 13:10.775
Don't worry about me, I can take a punch.

13:10.825 --> 13:11.895
What happened?

13:11.945 --> 13:13.295
Has someone clumped you?

13:13.345 --> 13:15.175
Don't be silly, I was joking!

13:15.225 --> 13:17.215
I fell off the running machine at the gym.

13:17.265 --> 13:18.575
Ah, silly girl!

13:18.625 --> 13:21.735
How big a twat did I feel in
a room full of septic-tanks?

13:21.785 --> 13:24.175
You haven't asked what the
volleyball score was, Molly.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.135
That's because I don't give a toss.

13:26.185 --> 13:27.895
We come second.

13:27.945 --> 13:29.535
Ah, you look pig sick, Mansfield.

13:29.585 --> 13:31.455
He has just eaten a whole pig.

13:31.505 --> 13:33.905
I'm going vegetarian as soon as I get home.

13:36.465 --> 13:39.135
Right. Need bodies to unload a truck.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.585
Anyone? Anyone?

13:44.225 --> 13:45.465
Just you, Dawes?

13:47.345 --> 13:48.625
OK, let's go.

14:00.985 --> 14:03.055
A job shared is a job halved.

14:03.105 --> 14:04.415
Or something.

14:04.465 --> 14:07.265
Yeah, cool, mate. Yeah,
know exactly what you mean.

14:08.505 --> 14:10.145
Moll, what really happened?

14:11.265 --> 14:12.255
I told you.

14:12.305 --> 14:13.345
The truth.

14:17.225 --> 14:20.545
Moll, I know I ballsed it
up between us at the fob.

14:21.825 --> 14:24.615
But your friendship means so much to me.

14:24.665 --> 14:26.185
I need you in my life.

14:27.585 --> 14:30.015
I am in your life, Smurf.

14:30.065 --> 14:33.535
And that's what makes it bearable.

14:33.585 --> 14:35.655
I ain't just saying this
to make you feel better

14:35.705 --> 14:37.815
but you really are a fucking top bloke!

14:37.865 --> 14:39.215
Really?

14:39.265 --> 14:42.015
Don't sound too surprised.

14:42.065 --> 14:43.465
I need you in my life too.

14:45.665 --> 14:47.455
There, I said it.

14:47.505 --> 14:49.735
Now shut your hole and let's crack on.

14:49.785 --> 14:50.855
Mates.

14:50.905 --> 14:52.175
Best mates?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.265
Don't push it.

14:54.345 --> 14:56.465
Now, what really happened to your face?

14:57.985 --> 14:59.895
Mission to capture Badrai.

14:59.945 --> 15:01.935
Didn't really go as planned.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.295
You and the Boss Man?

15:03.345 --> 15:05.335
And the ASF.

15:05.385 --> 15:07.375
He's still out there.

15:07.425 --> 15:09.255
We felt guilty.

15:09.305 --> 15:12.625
No, we didn't, we just
don't trust you two alone!

15:16.945 --> 15:19.655
What are they going to do with
all this kit in Cyprus, anyway?

15:19.705 --> 15:22.655
They'll get the poor sods deployed
out there to unload it and then...

15:22.705 --> 15:24.175
They'll stack it somewhere else.

15:24.225 --> 15:26.375
Then re-load it back again
into another container

15:26.425 --> 15:28.855
- when we're deployed out to Africa.
- What?

15:28.905 --> 15:31.255
That's where Brains reckons
it's going to kick off next.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.975
Central African Republic. Mark my words.

15:34.025 --> 15:35.735
Where's that then?

15:35.785 --> 15:38.815
Central Africa, you penis face.

15:38.865 --> 15:40.105
Charming!

15:43.665 --> 15:45.295
You all right?

15:45.345 --> 15:47.215
Smurf, stop asking me if I'm all right.

15:47.265 --> 15:50.175
The minute I'm not all
right I'll let you know.

15:50.225 --> 15:52.825
I can understand why
that guy clumped you now.

15:54.385 --> 15:55.535
Jokes!

15:55.585 --> 15:56.625
Good 'un.

15:58.745 --> 16:00.415
If my old girl's right,

16:00.465 --> 16:01.855
I'll never get to see Vegas.

16:01.905 --> 16:03.575
Your old girl ain't going to be right.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.815
Great, so we're going to Vegas!

16:05.865 --> 16:07.745
I walked into that one, didn't I?

16:12.585 --> 16:15.215
That is the dress I'm getting you.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.655
Classy.

16:16.705 --> 16:19.255
Imagine how good are you going
to look on my arm wearing that?

16:19.305 --> 16:21.135
I'm not going to be on
your arm though, am I?

16:21.185 --> 16:23.335
You're going to be 20 paces behind me.

16:23.385 --> 16:25.455
Are you ashamed to be seen out with me?

16:25.505 --> 16:27.215
Mortified, mate.

16:27.265 --> 16:30.295
You'd better cheer up a bit before
we go to the chapel to see Elvis.

16:30.345 --> 16:33.055
There's only two things
wrong with that, Smurf.

16:33.105 --> 16:35.615
I ain't marrying you and Elvis is dead.

16:35.665 --> 16:36.655
Dead?

16:36.705 --> 16:39.255
Ah, break it to me slowly...

16:39.305 --> 16:40.935
I didn't even realise he was ill!

16:40.985 --> 16:43.575
I thought you lot were
supposed to be working?

16:43.625 --> 16:45.855
Boys, come on.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.585
What's the matter with you?

16:49.145 --> 16:50.425
Dawes,

16:51.425 --> 16:53.185
I need you now.

17:04.744 --> 17:07.535
They'll be nothing left of the place soon.

17:07.585 --> 17:08.984
Not long.

17:10.545 --> 17:13.655
You looking forward to going home, Boss?

17:13.704 --> 17:15.224
No.

17:16.585 --> 17:19.145
Mansfield wanted to
stay in the fob forever.

17:22.185 --> 17:25.295
Well, if you find a moment
where you feel happy...

17:25.345 --> 17:26.744
You or Mansfield?

17:31.945 --> 17:34.385
They're waiting for us in
the detention facility, Dawes.

17:41.585 --> 17:43.065
Major Morley.

17:44.065 --> 17:45.975
As you were.

17:46.025 --> 17:48.455
The three insurgents
have now been questioned

17:48.505 --> 17:50.815
and certain information gleaned.

17:50.865 --> 17:54.705
We believe Badrai has fled to a
Taliban stronghold in the mountains.

17:56.225 --> 17:58.775
The insurgent who struck you.

17:58.825 --> 18:00.855
You have no idea who he is?

18:00.905 --> 18:02.615
- No.
- Are you sure about that?

18:02.665 --> 18:03.895
Sir.

18:03.945 --> 18:05.255
He knows you.

18:05.305 --> 18:06.505
Me?

18:16.865 --> 18:18.375
I don't know him.

18:18.425 --> 18:19.905
What's he said?

18:23.625 --> 18:25.535
I am saying nothing.

18:25.585 --> 18:27.615
Why did you attack that British medic?

18:38.105 --> 18:39.585
Did he just say Bashira?

18:42.385 --> 18:45.255
He's saying you have ruined everything.

18:45.305 --> 18:46.735
He knows me?

18:46.785 --> 18:47.975
It would seem so.

18:48.025 --> 18:50.855
He keeps saying it is all your fault.

18:50.905 --> 18:52.535
Even Bashira.

18:52.585 --> 18:54.815
So he was just saying
"Bashira"? He knows her?

18:55.165 --> 18:56.135
Yes.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.775
He won't identify himself
or give us any information.

18:58.825 --> 19:00.185
Just that it's your fault.

19:01.185 --> 19:03.455
Sir, permission to talk to the detainee?

19:03.505 --> 19:05.495
I really don't think
that's a good idea, Dawes.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.055
If it's my fault, Sir, he can
look me in the eye and tell me.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.775
He might reveal more.

19:10.825 --> 19:12.895
He's been restrained.
Let's see what happens.

19:12.945 --> 19:14.535
Are you going to tell him I'm coming in?

19:14.585 --> 19:17.175
No. Element of surprise.

19:17.225 --> 19:20.375
You go in there, sit in the
chair opposite and look at him.

19:20.425 --> 19:25.015
If he says nothing, simply and
calmly ask him why it's your fault.

19:25.065 --> 19:26.575
Yes, Sir.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.295
Nothing's going to happen to you.

19:29.345 --> 19:30.385
You ready?

19:32.625 --> 19:34.265
Count to ten and follow us in.

20:27.505 --> 20:29.185
She has torn my family apart.

20:31.745 --> 20:32.735
Have I?

20:43.945 --> 20:47.215
My sister has been taken
and my father hunted.

20:47.265 --> 20:49.535
Hunted like an animal.

20:49.585 --> 20:50.855
Badrai is your father?

21:01.625 --> 21:03.935
He's saying, "Everything
was fine until the Americans

21:03.985 --> 21:06.105
and British came and tried to kill us."

21:09.865 --> 21:10.895
Bashira is your sister?

21:10.945 --> 21:12.425
Not any more!

21:13.465 --> 21:17.735
You corrupted her with
your pens and sweets.

21:17.785 --> 21:18.815
What do you mean?

21:18.865 --> 21:23.055
I mean you no right destroy my country.

21:23.105 --> 21:25.385
I mean you no right destroy my family.

21:30.265 --> 21:31.505
I ain't scared of you.

21:47.865 --> 21:49.385
We will be revenged.

21:54.185 --> 21:56.185
My father will avenge our honour.

21:57.385 --> 21:58.705
How?

22:02.905 --> 22:04.105
Bashira.

22:06.105 --> 22:07.545
She will pay for her sins.

22:10.305 --> 22:11.545
She's safe.

22:19.145 --> 22:20.385
Not any more.

22:27.145 --> 22:28.735
Badrai's clearly on his way to Kabul.

22:28.785 --> 22:30.135
And he has explosives with him.

22:30.185 --> 22:32.255
He's likely to be planning
a significant attack.

22:32.305 --> 22:34.095
We mustn't let him anywhere near Bashira.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.135
We won't.

22:35.185 --> 22:37.895
A contact's provided intel on
the vehicle Badrai is likely to

22:37.945 --> 22:39.595
be travelling in and will
inform us when he's under way.

22:39.865 --> 22:41.455
Let's prep the mission immediately.

22:41.505 --> 22:44.015
Afghan Special Forces and a
team of your Brits as back up.

22:44.065 --> 22:45.425
I'll lead 2 Section, Sir.

22:48.385 --> 22:50.735
I've destroyed that family.

22:50.785 --> 22:52.815
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.

22:52.865 --> 22:54.935
Instead of saving Bashira
I've put her in danger.

22:54.985 --> 22:57.575
I mean, what was wrong with the
life that she had before I come

22:57.625 --> 22:59.375
and kiboshed everything?

22:59.425 --> 23:02.215
Right, fine, she didn't go to
school but maybe that ain't so bad.

23:02.265 --> 23:03.975
You've always done the right thing.

23:04.025 --> 23:05.655
He's going to get her, isn't he?

23:05.705 --> 23:08.415
- No.
- Yes, he is, and it's all my fault.

23:08.465 --> 23:10.615
No, he won't because we're
going to support the ASF

23:10.665 --> 23:12.175
and make sure that doesn't happen.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.735
You know and I know if I didn't
get involved she'd be fine.

23:14.785 --> 23:15.975
Sohail would be fine.

23:16.025 --> 23:19.535
My section would be fine, playing
volleyball and eating sausages

23:19.585 --> 23:23.225
and instead I'm about to put them
in danger, all because I fucked up.

23:26.945 --> 23:28.265
Come here.

23:31.745 --> 23:34.495
He wanted to kill that
little girl and you saved her!

23:34.545 --> 23:37.415
Her brother just looked me in the
eye and told me it was all my fault.

23:37.465 --> 23:39.855
Well, I'm looking you in the
eye and telling you it isn't.

23:39.905 --> 23:41.625
It is. I'm an epic fail!

23:42.865 --> 23:45.495
A little while ago I would have agreed.

23:45.545 --> 23:47.775
You've taught me more in
the last few months than

23:47.825 --> 23:49.615
a year at Sandhurst
and four tours ever did.

23:49.665 --> 23:50.735
I don't think so.

23:50.785 --> 23:52.455
Well, I happen to know so.

23:52.505 --> 23:55.015
When I first saw you, I thought
you'd hold the platoon back,

23:55.065 --> 23:56.135
be one of those bad apples

23:56.185 --> 23:58.055
that infects the rest of those around them.

23:58.105 --> 24:00.135
Maybe you were right.

24:00.185 --> 24:02.855
You've made me engage my brain.

24:02.905 --> 24:04.575
We need to fix the small cogs on the wheel

24:04.625 --> 24:06.815
so the whole huge Afghanistan can work.

24:06.865 --> 24:08.935
But I haven't fixed
anything. I've broken it.

24:08.985 --> 24:10.255
No, you haven't,

24:10.305 --> 24:11.815
you were right all along.

24:11.865 --> 24:14.175
We do need to get involved,
look after that little girl

24:14.225 --> 24:16.295
and give her a life.

24:16.345 --> 24:18.855
The only way we can fix the big
things is by fixing the small.

24:18.905 --> 24:20.025
You taught me that.

24:22.305 --> 24:23.345
Really?

24:24.385 --> 24:27.265
You should be proud of
the soldier you've become.

24:31.105 --> 24:32.305
Thank you, Boss.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.385
I'm not always going to be your boss.

24:36.385 --> 24:37.545
Not when we get home.

24:39.465 --> 24:40.665
"We"?

24:46.425 --> 24:48.135
Have you ever been to Bath?

24:48.185 --> 24:50.105
You know, the city.

24:53.185 --> 24:54.985
No, but it sounds a bit shit.

24:56.145 --> 24:57.735
It's perfect.

24:57.785 --> 24:59.375
I don't do perfect.

24:59.425 --> 25:00.735
Don't really suit me.

25:00.785 --> 25:02.575
Yes, it does.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.735
My parents have got an old house there.

25:04.785 --> 25:06.055
It's where I grew up.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.815
I don't like those scary houses
with the big staircases what

25:08.865 --> 25:10.375
people fall down.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.905
Like in The Omen, have you seen that?

25:14.345 --> 25:16.425
That house at Christmas is magical.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.825
Are you inviting me for Christmas, Boss?

25:23.665 --> 25:25.505
You got a moment, Boss?

25:30.105 --> 25:31.385
Get in there.

25:34.345 --> 25:35.745
What do you want, Smurf?

25:43.305 --> 25:45.095
Nothing to do?

25:45.145 --> 25:46.785
Boss, it's just, er...

25:48.225 --> 25:51.055
Smurf?

25:51.105 --> 25:52.585
Sorry, Boss.

25:55.385 --> 25:56.705
What's wrong?

26:07.025 --> 26:08.265
Engagement ring.

26:11.225 --> 26:14.775
That is very sweet of you and all Smurf

26:14.825 --> 26:17.385
but my feelings for
you are purely platonic.

26:19.025 --> 26:21.335
Despite what my grandad says,

26:21.385 --> 26:24.695
Winston Churchill ain't the
greatest Brit who ever lived.

26:24.745 --> 26:26.065
You are.

26:27.185 --> 26:30.585
And if I had a dad, I'd
want him to be like you.

26:33.745 --> 26:36.305
I'm a bit young to be
your dad, aren't I Smurf?

26:37.505 --> 26:41.495
Mum's got this kind of gloomy feeling
that I ain't going to be coming home.

26:41.545 --> 26:44.255
I told her all about
how I feel and that and

26:44.305 --> 26:46.185
she sent me her engagement ring.

26:47.225 --> 26:49.375
Reckoned she didn't need it any more.

26:49.425 --> 26:53.575
And she said I shouldn't
put off until tomorrow

26:53.625 --> 26:54.975
what I can do today.

26:55.025 --> 26:58.975
Cos there might not be a
tomorrow. You never know.

26:59.025 --> 27:01.695
What the hell are you talking about?

27:01.745 --> 27:02.935
You know, Sir.

27:02.985 --> 27:04.465
No, I don't.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.145
Molly!

27:18.625 --> 27:24.175
Smurf, nothing is going to
happen to you on this tour.

27:24.225 --> 27:26.575
Tell your mum to stop panicking.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.615
Can I suggest you put
that ring in your pocket

27:28.665 --> 27:31.335
and you don't get it back
out until you're in Newport?

27:31.385 --> 27:33.215
You're here to work

27:33.265 --> 27:36.695
and I won't have anyone take
their eyes off the task in hand.

27:36.745 --> 27:37.935
But if Molly says "yes"...

27:37.985 --> 27:40.935
You do not allow personal feelings
to interfere with your work.

27:40.985 --> 27:42.055
I'm not, Sir.

27:42.105 --> 27:43.735
That is exactly what you're doing.

27:43.785 --> 27:45.895
Word is, we're out of Bastion on a mission

27:45.945 --> 27:48.775
and I wanted to square it away
with her in case something happens.

27:48.825 --> 27:51.255
Smurf, put the ring away

27:51.305 --> 27:52.975
and don't mention any of this to me again

27:53.025 --> 27:54.815
else I'll put you on the first plane home.

27:54.865 --> 27:57.415
It's against army protocol
and it's endangering all of us.

27:57.465 --> 27:58.775
Is that understood?

27:58.825 --> 28:00.255
How am I endangering all of us?

28:00.305 --> 28:02.345
Smurf, go. Now.

28:11.305 --> 28:13.335
Sorry, Boss.

28:13.385 --> 28:15.095
Just...

28:15.145 --> 28:16.665
I only wanted some advice.

28:18.705 --> 28:20.785
How did you propose to your wife?

28:30.265 --> 28:31.855
Mission briefing at 20:00 hours.

28:31.970 --> 28:33.450
Now, go.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.880
This is exactly what I meant
and why I said "wait out".

29:01.930 --> 29:04.240
You're annoyed with me?
How the hell does that work?

29:04.290 --> 29:06.120
But I'm saying I've done the same as Smurf.

29:06.170 --> 29:07.960
We're supposed to be here to work, Dawes.

29:08.010 --> 29:10.520
- You're married and you didn't think to say?
- We're split up.

29:10.570 --> 29:11.720
Separated.

29:11.770 --> 29:15.160
- I've come on tour so she can sort everything out.
- You're married.

29:15.210 --> 29:16.760
What, did that just slip your mind?

29:16.810 --> 29:18.160
Did you not hear what I just said?

29:18.210 --> 29:19.480
- You lied to me.
- Not once.

29:19.530 --> 29:21.840
Well, you were very fucking
economical with the truth.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.550
What are you going to tell
me next, that you've got kids?

29:29.450 --> 29:31.290
Oh, shit. He has.

29:49.530 --> 29:50.640
Moll.

29:50.690 --> 29:54.120
Briefing at 20:00 hours. It's happening.

29:54.170 --> 29:55.210
OK.

29:56.730 --> 29:58.200
You all right? You seem a bit...

29:58.250 --> 30:00.170
I'm just being quiet, that's all.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.290
Fair enough.

30:03.650 --> 30:05.200
Do you want me to get you anything?

30:05.250 --> 30:07.810
I can get you a pizza
or something if you want?

30:10.330 --> 30:12.090
Are you sure you're OK, Molls?

30:20.290 --> 30:22.560
Hey.

30:22.610 --> 30:26.250
Hey, don't you worry, all right?

30:27.570 --> 30:30.240
What am I not supposed
to worry about, Smurf?

30:30.290 --> 30:32.520
The mission.

30:32.570 --> 30:34.080
Nothing.

30:34.130 --> 30:36.400
No-one will hurt you.

30:36.450 --> 30:38.240
Ever.

30:38.290 --> 30:41.290
It's OK, let it all out.

30:50.650 --> 30:52.480
What am I like?

30:52.530 --> 30:53.770
Don't worry about it.

30:58.810 --> 31:02.080
Sorry that I'm such a
fuckmuppet half the time.

31:02.130 --> 31:03.570
You and me both, eh?

31:07.450 --> 31:10.520
Sometimes things can creep up on you...

31:10.570 --> 31:11.970
I'm the same.

31:16.370 --> 31:18.200
Thank you.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.240
I couldn't have got through
this tour without you.

31:21.290 --> 31:23.480
We help each other through.

31:23.530 --> 31:24.890
That's the point.

31:27.090 --> 31:28.810
You're a proper mate.

31:35.250 --> 31:38.000
Molls, I'm going to give you something now

31:38.050 --> 31:41.480
and maybe it don't mean anything

31:41.530 --> 31:43.360
as much as maybe I'd like it to.

31:43.410 --> 31:46.080
Please Smurf, not now.

31:46.130 --> 31:48.880
I know what your answer will be so
I'm just going to give it you now,

31:48.930 --> 31:51.720
no strings attached.

31:51.770 --> 31:54.040
While I've got the chance.

31:54.090 --> 31:57.160
Might not get the opportunity again cos

31:57.210 --> 31:59.720
things happen and that

31:59.770 --> 32:01.370
and we're on a mission so...

32:08.610 --> 32:11.690
It's my mum's ring, but
I want you to have it.

32:13.410 --> 32:16.400
I mean, you're my best mate and

32:16.450 --> 32:18.130
it so doesn't suit me.

32:20.890 --> 32:22.530
You are so sweet, Smurf.

32:24.170 --> 32:25.920
Am I?

32:25.970 --> 32:27.010
Sometimes.

32:31.170 --> 32:32.890
You'll keep it yeah, the ring?

32:35.890 --> 32:38.000
Well, if it doesn't suit
you I'll look after it

32:38.050 --> 32:39.490
until you want it back.

32:43.450 --> 32:45.160
You've looked after me

32:45.210 --> 32:48.560
so I'm going to look after
you till I've got you home.

32:48.610 --> 32:51.960
That Badrai ain't
getting anywhere near you.

32:52.010 --> 32:53.370
I promise.

33:09.460 --> 33:10.740
Sit up!

33:12.220 --> 33:13.380
Relax.

33:15.060 --> 33:19.250
The insurgent known to us as
Badrai is on his way to Kabul with

33:19.300 --> 33:21.370
a cache of explosives.

33:21.420 --> 33:22.970
Our objective is to ID

33:23.020 --> 33:26.180
and apprehend him before he
causes significant loss of life.

33:27.980 --> 33:30.090
Badrai is currently in the mountain region.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.650
In order to reach Kabul he

33:31.700 --> 33:34.980
needs to cross the river where
there's an existing ANA check point.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.730
Now, reliable intel informs us that

33:38.780 --> 33:40.290
the truck he's likely to be

33:40.340 --> 33:42.890
travelling in is already on the road.

33:42.940 --> 33:48.610
The ANA will stop the truck
so no suspicion is aroused.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.890
The only person who can positively
ID the target is Private Dawes.

33:52.940 --> 33:56.330
But any visible presence of UK
forces risks alerting Taliban

33:56.380 --> 33:58.770
spotters who will warn Badrai.

33:58.820 --> 34:01.610
So it is imperative that this

34:01.660 --> 34:04.500
remains a covert operation

34:08.340 --> 34:10.810
At 02:00 2 Section will
board the helicopter

34:10.860 --> 34:13.969
and travel to the region
under the cover of darkness.

34:14.020 --> 34:15.969
We'll be dropped 3km from the bridge,

34:16.020 --> 34:18.530
so as to not attract any attention.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.130
From there we will make our way to the

34:20.179 --> 34:23.090
check-point along an irrigation ditch.

34:23.139 --> 34:27.170
The ditch leads to a disused
compound 50 metres away from

34:27.219 --> 34:30.889
the check-point, which we will need
to reach and secure before dawn.

34:30.940 --> 34:34.179
An ASF officer who will be
with the ANA will make contact.

34:36.219 --> 34:37.770
We then await the arrival of the truck

34:37.820 --> 34:42.050
suspected of transporting Badrai,
at which point we'll break cover

34:42.100 --> 34:43.850
and Private Dawes will be called up to ID

34:43.900 --> 34:45.690
the occupant.

34:45.739 --> 34:49.489
Once Badrai has been apprehended
we'll radio for extraction.

34:49.540 --> 34:52.370
This mission will determine
how successful our time

34:52.420 --> 34:54.449
in Afghanistan has been.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.970
If Badrai eludes us, lives will be lost.

34:58.020 --> 35:00.180
One life is one too many.

35:02.060 --> 35:03.580
Any questions?

35:04.580 --> 35:06.530
No, Sir.

35:06.580 --> 35:08.100
Let's go get him.

35:52.300 --> 35:55.570
Right, Smurf, central in
the ditch, edging forward.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.210
Everyone else focus up.

35:57.260 --> 36:00.010
Keep a couple of metres between
you and the person in front of you.

36:00.060 --> 36:01.100
Let's go.

36:08.780 --> 36:10.170
You can hate me if it helps

36:10.220 --> 36:12.340
but I'm getting you home in one piece.

36:42.420 --> 36:43.730
What the hell was that?

36:43.780 --> 36:45.380
Has anyone got a visual?

36:47.380 --> 36:49.020
Everybody stay down!

36:50.260 --> 36:52.250
- Is everyone all right?
- You OK?

36:52.300 --> 36:53.770
Must have been a mortar...

36:53.820 --> 36:55.530
It's ringing in my ear holes!

36:55.580 --> 36:56.820
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.330
It's thunder.

37:04.380 --> 37:06.420
It's bloody thunder!

37:16.340 --> 37:18.130
Rain in Afghan!

37:18.180 --> 37:21.340
I'm so not booking this
again next year, Sir.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.740
Everyone focus up. Smurf, on you go.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.410
That's the bridge 50 metres west, Sir.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.100
Got it. I can see the check point.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.970
That's the compound. 50 metres south.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.410
Right, guys, let's secure the compound.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.180
Baz and Smurf, lead on.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.540
Clear.

38:34.860 --> 38:36.420
- Clear.
- Clear.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.130
Kinders and Dangleberries,
I want you out those windows

38:44.180 --> 38:45.300
- on guard duty now.
- Yes, Sir.

38:45.780 --> 38:47.290
Mansfield and Smurf next.

38:47.340 --> 38:49.330
Then Fingers and Brains,
then Nude-Nut and Baz.

38:49.380 --> 38:51.610
Dawes, I want you setting
up a temporary med centre.

38:51.660 --> 38:52.970
Boss.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.020
Let's get this place squared away.

39:04.980 --> 39:06.650
You need help?

39:06.700 --> 39:07.980
I'm all right.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.850
Are you?

39:13.900 --> 39:15.700
Yeah.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.700
What?

39:24.860 --> 39:26.810
We are doing the right thing.

39:26.860 --> 39:29.010
Never lose sense of that.

39:29.060 --> 39:32.050
I just hope that the right thing
doesn't get those boys killed.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.860
Everything is under control.

39:35.060 --> 39:37.060
You volunteered for this mission.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.730
Yes.

39:40.780 --> 39:44.250
You could be safely tucked
up in your gaff in Kabul.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.780
This word? Gaff?

39:47.220 --> 39:48.740
House.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.010
We had an apartment.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.180
Did you sell it?

39:59.780 --> 40:01.220
There was an explosion.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.060
Is that what happened to
your wife and daughter?

40:10.820 --> 40:13.250
Now I have nothing.

40:13.300 --> 40:15.370
Except the guilt.

40:15.420 --> 40:16.980
It weren't your fault.

40:20.540 --> 40:22.580
But I survived...

40:24.820 --> 40:26.700
... and sometimes I wish I hadn't.

40:28.340 --> 40:30.260
So you volunteer for missions?

40:33.860 --> 40:36.220
Bashira's the age my daughter...

40:38.620 --> 40:40.420
... was when she...

40:46.700 --> 40:49.380
And you are the age my
daughter would have been.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.930
Unidentified male approaching!

41:05.980 --> 41:07.170
Has he got a weapon?

41:07.220 --> 41:08.420
Can't tell, Boss.

41:09.540 --> 41:11.370
Identify yourself!

41:11.420 --> 41:12.980
Halt! Stand still!

41:14.540 --> 41:16.220
Sergeant Ramazan-Ali.

41:18.860 --> 41:20.650
Sergeant Ramazan-Ali.

41:20.700 --> 41:22.170
He's ASF, Boss.

41:22.220 --> 41:24.290
Advance one and be recognised.

41:24.340 --> 41:26.220
Relax, guys, he's our ASF contact.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.410
Salaam alaikum.

41:36.460 --> 41:37.700
Wa alaikum assalaam.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.380
Manchester United!

41:42.700 --> 41:45.090
Nah. Derby County me, mate.

41:45.140 --> 41:46.900
Support your local team, mate.

41:48.020 --> 41:50.170
Manchester United plays in red

41:50.220 --> 41:53.170
and Manchester City plays in blue.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.810
What is this going on?

41:54.860 --> 41:56.850
You? Who you?

41:56.900 --> 41:58.010
I'm a red, mate.

41:58.060 --> 41:59.930
Liverpool?

41:59.980 --> 42:02.610
Me and you are going to fall out, mate.

42:11.500 --> 42:14.050
He says the ANA at the check
point will make radio contact

42:14.100 --> 42:16.020
with him as the truck approaches.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.380
So what now then, Boss Man?

42:23.220 --> 42:24.500
We wait out.

43:06.220 --> 43:07.380
All right?

43:10.060 --> 43:12.130
That Ramazan-Ali's a
bit of a case, isn't he?

43:12.180 --> 43:13.770
Yeah, bit of a nut case.

43:13.820 --> 43:15.450
It's a bit worrying that he's the best

43:15.500 --> 43:17.610
that we've got at the check point.

43:17.660 --> 43:19.180
It's going to be all right.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.930
What is?

43:21.980 --> 43:23.930
Everything.

43:23.980 --> 43:26.090
We're going to have Badrai
by the short and curlies

43:26.140 --> 43:28.370
and back at Bastion before
breakfast has finished.

43:28.420 --> 43:29.850
You were all gloom

43:29.900 --> 43:33.210
and doom a few moments ago with your
mum's premonition and everything.

43:33.260 --> 43:36.130
I just know everything's
going to be all right.

43:36.180 --> 43:37.500
Perfect, in fact.

43:39.300 --> 43:42.370
You're wearing my mum's
ring and we're going home!

43:42.420 --> 43:45.380
Calm down, mate, it's
around me neck not me finger.

43:48.140 --> 43:50.890
When I first came out here to Afghan,

43:50.940 --> 43:53.740
I honestly didn't give a
toss what happened to me.

43:55.020 --> 43:56.250
But now...

43:56.300 --> 43:58.100
Stop talking bollocks, Smurf.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.780
Fair play!

44:03.780 --> 44:07.410
It's funny though, innit?
When you think about it.

44:07.460 --> 44:09.050
What?

44:09.100 --> 44:12.260
Well, I just wish I'd text you back.

44:13.500 --> 44:16.290
I knew you were keen on me but
I knew I was coming to Afghan.

44:16.340 --> 44:18.290
"Keen on you"?

44:18.340 --> 44:19.690
Dream on, mate.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.290
If I'd have called you
back and we'd met up,

44:22.340 --> 44:23.890
who knows what might have happened?

44:23.940 --> 44:25.610
I do. I'd have ended up killing you

44:25.660 --> 44:27.860
before you got on that plane to Afghan.

44:30.780 --> 44:32.890
Funny though, innit?

44:32.940 --> 44:34.460
How everything works out.

44:35.980 --> 44:38.970
Like the bullet that got Geraint.

44:39.020 --> 44:40.650
Thousand to one they reckon.

44:40.700 --> 44:43.130
Fraction of an inch either
side and he'd still be alive.

44:43.180 --> 44:45.210
That's all I mean,

44:45.260 --> 44:47.050
if I'd have called you

44:47.100 --> 44:49.690
and we'd met up after that night
round the back of the Indian

44:49.740 --> 44:52.090
takeaway maybe we'd be together, maybe...

44:52.140 --> 44:54.330
Smurf, go back to Newport.

44:54.380 --> 44:56.260
Find someone who deserves you.

45:02.540 --> 45:04.450
Well done, Dawes.

45:04.500 --> 45:06.050
It's all looking ship shape.

45:06.100 --> 45:08.090
I've packed most of it
in the med bergan, Boss.

45:08.140 --> 45:10.180
In case we need it at the CP.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.330
It's not an ideal situation

45:28.380 --> 45:30.860
if we're attacked from the south up here.

45:32.220 --> 45:34.930
We just wait out for that truck

45:34.980 --> 45:36.180
and for Badrai.

45:40.140 --> 45:41.810
You OK?

45:41.860 --> 45:43.340
Why wouldn't I be?

45:47.660 --> 45:49.340
I have a son.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.330
He's part of my life.

45:53.380 --> 45:54.570
Of course I wanted to tell you

45:54.620 --> 45:56.450
but the appropriate moment never came up.

45:56.500 --> 45:57.620
You really hurt me.

46:00.020 --> 46:02.170
All I want is to make you happy.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.180
Well, you fucked up big time.

46:11.260 --> 46:12.890
In that ditch, when the thunder...

46:12.940 --> 46:14.890
Frightened the life out of me.

46:14.940 --> 46:16.300
Exactly.

46:17.780 --> 46:20.860
In that moment a lot of
things flashed through my mind.

46:25.260 --> 46:27.290
I thought it was the end.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.620
So did I.

46:31.740 --> 46:35.820
I turned and looked at you and...

46:37.780 --> 46:39.380
... you were all I wanted.

46:44.620 --> 46:46.620
I want you to be the last thing I see.

46:50.620 --> 46:51.980
Ditto.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.220
Boss Man, target on the way!

47:53.340 --> 47:56.010
Ramazan-Ali has comms from the checkpoint.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.650
They will stop the truck.
We await instruction.

48:00.700 --> 48:02.700
Right, everyone, prepare. Kit up.

48:16.500 --> 48:19.260
The truck is approaching
the first check point.

48:36.540 --> 48:38.170
Sir, they're letting it through.

48:38.220 --> 48:39.850
It's crossing the bridge.

48:43.300 --> 48:46.050
- What's he saying, Qaseem?
- He's making sure they stop the truck.

48:46.100 --> 48:47.930
We're going to lose him, Sir!

48:53.180 --> 48:55.130
They've got it at the second barrier.

48:55.180 --> 48:56.850
It's stopped, Sir.

48:56.900 --> 48:58.100
Stopped.

48:59.180 --> 49:00.940
Right guys, listen in.

49:07.980 --> 49:10.450
We're together and we're in one piece.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.970
And that's how we're going to
leave once we've ID'd Badrai.

49:13.020 --> 49:14.050
Is that understood?

49:14.100 --> 49:15.140
Sir.

49:16.980 --> 49:19.690
I am proud to serve alongside
each and every one of you.

49:19.740 --> 49:21.900
You make me the soldier I am.

49:22.980 --> 49:24.690
Baz, lead out.

49:24.740 --> 49:25.780
Yes, Sir.

50:11.820 --> 50:13.090
Boss...

50:13.140 --> 50:14.810
I've clocked him, Baz.

50:14.860 --> 50:16.530
He don't feel right, does he?

50:16.580 --> 50:19.010
It's the ones you can't see
you got to watch out for.

50:19.060 --> 50:20.970
Everyone take up your positions.

50:21.020 --> 50:22.380
Smurf, you're with me.

50:43.140 --> 50:45.420
Farmer Giles still having a gawp at us.

50:49.700 --> 50:52.300
Smurf, eyes on that
farmer and covering west.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.410
Dawes.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.180
You're to examine the back of the truck.

51:32.780 --> 51:34.740
- Salaam alaikum.
- Salaam alaikum.

51:52.180 --> 51:54.140
Everything looking as it should do, Dawes?

51:56.380 --> 51:58.650
Something ain't right, Boss.

52:01.300 --> 52:02.890
- Was that contact?
- Take cover.

52:02.940 --> 52:05.010
Smurf? What the fuck are you doing?!

52:05.060 --> 52:07.730
Come on you wanker, go for your weapon!

52:10.740 --> 52:12.370
Smurf, what he fuck are you doing?

52:12.420 --> 52:14.530
Does that farmer even have a gun?

52:14.580 --> 52:16.490
Go for your weapon!

52:16.540 --> 52:19.450
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

52:19.500 --> 52:21.610
Put your gun down, Smurf.

52:21.660 --> 52:24.490
- Is he an insurgent, Boss?
- Has he got a weapon?

52:24.540 --> 52:26.730
Smurf, what the fuck happened?

52:26.780 --> 52:29.010
You. That's what fucking happened.

52:29.060 --> 52:30.370
What are you talking about?

52:30.420 --> 52:31.650
You've ruined everything.

52:31.700 --> 52:33.970
- What?
- I looked in.

52:34.020 --> 52:36.050
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about

52:36.100 --> 52:39.050
but you will put your gun down now, Smurf.

52:39.100 --> 52:40.690
Are you all right, Smurf?

52:40.740 --> 52:42.570
Boss, what the hell's going on?

52:42.620 --> 52:45.610
Hold your positions!
Smurf, put your gun down.

52:45.660 --> 52:47.930
Worried I might shoot you?

52:47.980 --> 52:50.130
What's happening? Is the
target in the truck, Boss?

52:50.180 --> 52:51.530
I don't know what the fuck you're

52:51.580 --> 52:53.930
talking about but you will
put your gun down now, Smurf.

52:53.980 --> 52:55.250
Lower your gun now, Smurf.

52:55.300 --> 52:58.290
I'd have laid down my life
for you, Boss. And Molly.

52:58.340 --> 53:01.370
Private Smith. Lower your
gun now. That is an order.

53:01.420 --> 53:06.290
But she wants you to be
the last thing she sees.

53:08.980 --> 53:10.170
Sir, we need to ID

53:10.220 --> 53:12.540
the people in the truck and get it moving.

53:15.900 --> 53:19.490
Me and Geraint were identical twins
and yet I was always the ugly one.

53:19.540 --> 53:21.410
How's that possible?

53:21.460 --> 53:24.210
I always got the shit end of the stick.

53:24.260 --> 53:28.490
Everyone loved him. I did. You did.

53:28.540 --> 53:31.050
And then, for the first
time in my life I found love,

53:31.100 --> 53:32.370
and then suddenly

53:32.420 --> 53:34.770
everything felt right,
everything felt like it should.

53:34.820 --> 53:35.890
And what happens?

53:35.940 --> 53:38.730
The man who I trust more than
anyone else in this world smashes me

53:38.780 --> 53:41.090
in the face with the shit end of the stick.

53:41.140 --> 53:43.530
Dylan Smith, you are
endangering this entire mission

53:43.580 --> 53:46.370
and the lives of your fellow
soldiers! You do not bring personal

53:46.420 --> 53:48.730
on to the battle field, is that understood?

53:48.780 --> 53:50.140
You did.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.450
Boss! Boss!

54:04.500 --> 54:06.730
Boss, it's Badrai!

54:06.780 --> 54:09.500
He's in the burka. Everybody take cover!

54:16.860 --> 54:20.890
Man down! Man down!

54:20.940 --> 54:24.330
Captain James is down!

54:24.380 --> 54:28.940
One Cat A, urgent med-evac
required! MIST out, wait out.

54:32.060 --> 54:34.050
Zero this is amber three
zero bravo. One Cat A.

54:34.100 --> 54:35.290
Urgent medivac required.

54:35.340 --> 54:37.770
Just stay with me, all right?
You're going to be all right.

54:37.820 --> 54:39.490
I'm going to get you out of here.

54:39.540 --> 54:40.970
Molly keep your head down!

54:41.020 --> 54:42.340
Get the fuck down, Smurf!

54:47.100 --> 54:52.450
Two Cat A, urgent med-evac required!
Repeat, urgent med-evac required.

54:52.500 --> 54:55.490
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

54:55.540 --> 54:58.810
Zero this is amber three zero
bravo. Emergency med-evac required.

54:58.860 --> 55:00.970
Wait out.

55:01.020 --> 55:02.890
Smurf, I'm going to
need a bit of self-help.

55:02.940 --> 55:04.450
Can you get a tourniquet on that?

55:04.500 --> 55:08.780
Stay with me, Sir, all right,
stay with me. Stay with me.

55:13.180 --> 55:14.810
Molly!

55:14.860 --> 55:16.530
Oi, that's Dawes to you.

55:16.580 --> 55:17.690
Smurf!

55:17.740 --> 55:19.890
How's Smurf?

55:19.940 --> 55:21.450
Where is he?

55:21.500 --> 55:24.290
Did he take a hit?

55:24.340 --> 55:26.530
Put direct pressure on this, Boss.

55:26.580 --> 55:28.250
How you doing?

55:28.300 --> 55:31.330
Smurf? How's he doing, Molly?

55:31.380 --> 55:33.890
He's doing all right, aren't you, Smurf?

55:33.940 --> 55:35.330
I dunno, Moll.

55:35.380 --> 55:36.970
Yes, you are.

55:37.020 --> 55:38.930
You're going to get better.

55:38.980 --> 55:42.250
You're going to get better
cos you're taking me to Vegas.

55:42.300 --> 55:43.970
You still want to go?

55:44.020 --> 55:46.340
More than anything in
the world. I promise you.

55:49.380 --> 55:51.650
Direct pressure. Put
direct pressure on that.

55:51.700 --> 55:53.570
Can anyone confirm he took a hit?

55:53.620 --> 55:54.890
How you doing, Boss?

55:54.940 --> 55:56.210
No, you have to treat Smurf.

55:56.260 --> 55:58.140
I'm treating both of you.

56:00.300 --> 56:02.540
I'm sorry.

56:04.220 --> 56:07.290
I'm sorry.

56:07.340 --> 56:08.970
Where the hell is he?

56:09.020 --> 56:10.940
Does anyone have eyes on Badrai?
