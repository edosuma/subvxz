00:14.966 --> 00:16.633
What is the time capsule butt-butt?

00:16.701 --> 00:19.602
We're about to open this time
capsule that we buried ten years ago.

00:19.670 --> 00:20.303
Oh.

00:20.371 --> 00:21.371
Yeah.

00:21.439 --> 00:22.339
What'd you put in there?

00:22.406 --> 00:24.507
Oh, man, we just put a bunch of
stuff in here that we thought

00:24.575 --> 00:26.710
would be valuable one day,
like, uh, let's see, we got a

00:26.777 --> 00:28.044
Gregg Jeffries baseball card.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.346
Future All-Star, future All-Star.

00:29.413 --> 00:30.146
It wasn't valuable then.

00:30.214 --> 00:31.214
Uh, we got a Korn CD.

00:31.282 --> 00:33.683
Uh, we got a copy of Cider
House Rules on laser disc.

00:33.751 --> 00:35.251
Don't know why we thought
that would be valuable.

00:35.319 --> 00:36.186
That's a collector's item.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.721
That's gonna be very... Be
very careful with that.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.689
Oh, my God, you guys, this is
a letter to my future self.

00:39.757 --> 00:40.557
What?!

00:40.624 --> 00:42.959
Yeah. "Dear future Dee,
How's Hollywood?

00:43.027 --> 00:44.394
Congrats on all of your success.

00:44.462 --> 00:45.495
Stay grounded.

00:45.563 --> 00:48.231
Enclosed is a check for
one million dollars.

00:48.299 --> 00:51.067
Be sure to give it to Dr.
Larry Myers as a thank you for all of

00:51.135 --> 00:51.968
his inspiration."

00:52.036 --> 00:52.969
Is this stupid?

00:53.037 --> 00:53.803
This is just stupid.

00:53.871 --> 00:54.938
Who's Dr. Larry Myers?

00:55.006 --> 00:56.239
Nobody. Doesn't matter.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.907
Just my high school drama teacher.

00:57.975 --> 00:58.775
This is just... it's dumb.

00:58.843 --> 01:01.111
Like, why would we put such
stupid stuff in here, and also

01:01.178 --> 01:03.546
we bur-buried it, and then we
opened it ten years later?

01:03.614 --> 01:05.548
What, are you supposed to just,
oh, bury it, open right up, and

01:05.616 --> 01:07.650
not give yourself any time to
fulfill any kind of dreams or...

01:07.718 --> 01:08.518
The whole thing's dumb.

01:08.586 --> 01:09.753
Like, Cider House Rules?

01:09.820 --> 01:11.488
Okay.

01:11.555 --> 01:12.422
Hormones.

01:12.556 --> 01:13.830
She's all worked out.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.230
It's the fattening.

01:16.350 --> 01:18.242
What else is in there?

01:18.362 --> 01:19.029
Uh, oh!

01:19.096 --> 01:19.729
Old pictures! Old pictures!

01:19.797 --> 01:20.730
Pictures!

01:20.798 --> 01:21.731
Holy shit, look at that!

01:21.799 --> 01:22.732
Look!

01:22.800 --> 01:23.867
The gang.

01:23.934 --> 01:24.901
Whew.

01:24.969 --> 01:26.002
Who's this jag-off?

01:26.070 --> 01:26.770
Look.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.171
Oh, that's Schmidty!

01:28.239 --> 01:29.005
Schmidty!

01:29.073 --> 01:30.607
He was the fourth member of our crew.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.275
There was another member of the gang?

01:32.343 --> 01:32.942
Oh, yeah, dude.

01:33.010 --> 01:33.643
I miss him, dude.

01:33.711 --> 01:35.545
Why did we ditch him in the first place?
I can't remember.

01:35.613 --> 01:36.146
I don't know.

01:36.213 --> 01:37.747
Eh, he wasn't a good fit.

01:37.815 --> 01:39.315
Remember? You know?

01:39.383 --> 01:40.717
Kind of got on our nerves.

01:40.785 --> 01:41.684
He didn't get on my nerves.

01:41.752 --> 01:43.794
No, he never got on my nerves.
I actually really loved that guy.

01:43.914 --> 01:44.641
You know what, I remember now.

01:44.761 --> 01:48.291
Charlie soured on him, and then
he, like, gave us an ultimatum.

01:48.359 --> 01:48.925
You remember?

01:48.993 --> 01:51.828
And then we all turned on th guy pretty quickly...
I mean, we all agreed he was

01:51.896 --> 01:54.697
out of the... You pushed him out
of a moving car and yelled

01:54.765 --> 01:56.099
"You're out of the gang!"

01:56.167 --> 01:58.201
Now, in hindsight, that
does seem a little rash.

01:58.269 --> 02:00.336
Yeah, it was a bit of a snap decision.

02:00.404 --> 02:03.106
Why don't you call this Schmidty guy
up and see what he's up to now?

02:03.174 --> 02:05.108
You know, I do feel like
we owe the guy an apology.

02:05.176 --> 02:07.110
Yeah. You know what, I'd
love to see Schmidty.

02:07.178 --> 02:07.777
I would, too.

02:07.845 --> 02:09.913
Yeah, but that's a bad
snap decision, you know?

02:09.979 --> 02:11.614
Like, there's a reason
he didn't work out.

02:11.682 --> 02:13.683
We got a good thing going
on now without him.

02:13.751 --> 02:15.652
We don't need a new
member of the gang.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.586
Don't get Schmidty.

02:16.654 --> 02:17.620
Don't get Schmidty.

Oh, he was the coolest.
Seriously.

02:57.446 --> 02:58.489
Oh...

02:58.609 --> 03:00.649
- Hey.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:00.769 --> 03:02.834
Mrs. Schmidt, it's it's Dennis.

03:02.954 --> 03:04.514
And Mac. You remember us, right?

03:04.634 --> 03:06.529
We're looking for Schmidty. He around?

03:06.854 --> 03:07.814
He's dead.

03:08.675 --> 03:12.331
Oh, gosh, that is too bad.
We're sorry for your loss.

03:12.451 --> 03:13.771
Hiyah!

03:14.975 --> 03:16.252
What's up bitches?

03:16.372 --> 03:17.700
That's Schmidty?

03:17.820 --> 03:19.799
Hey, we thought that you were dead.

03:19.919 --> 03:22.437
- He made me say it.
- I made you say it. listen to you, mom.

03:23.975 --> 03:25.564
You seen that shit?

03:25.684 --> 03:27.669
He jumped down a whole
flight of stairs.

03:27.737 --> 03:29.471
I didn't see you down there, Chuckles.

03:29.539 --> 03:30.539
How you been, little man?

03:30.606 --> 03:31.773
Not that little, you know?

03:31.841 --> 03:32.641
Regular size.

03:32.709 --> 03:34.076
Maybe he, but...
Not anymore.

03:34.143 --> 03:35.977
Put on a few LB's since
I saw you last, huh?

03:36.045 --> 03:36.511
No. Same weight.

03:36.579 --> 03:37.379
Same weight I always been.

03:37.447 --> 03:39.414
Yeah, no, he put on a lot of weight.

03:39.482 --> 03:40.449
No, you tacked on weight.

03:40.516 --> 03:42.317
I tacked on mass, muscle mass.

03:42.385 --> 03:43.785
Who's this old son of a bitch?

03:43.853 --> 03:44.286
I'm Frank.

03:44.353 --> 03:44.786
Frank?

03:44.854 --> 03:45.287
Frank.

03:45.354 --> 03:45.854
I'm Schmidty.

03:45.922 --> 03:46.688
Nice to... put her there.

03:46.756 --> 03:47.556
No!

03:48.424 --> 03:49.424
Don't kiss him.

03:49.492 --> 03:52.094
Hey, uh, so what brings
you dicks here, huh?

03:52.161 --> 03:56.898
Oh, well, Schmidty, um, honestly, we
came around here because we, um...

03:56.966 --> 03:58.233
Go ahead.

03:58.301 --> 04:00.202
...want to say we're
sorry, Schmidty.

04:00.269 --> 04:02.871
Yeah, yeah, we... Can
you take this, Mac?

04:02.939 --> 04:03.772
Yeah, man, I got this.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.141
Hey, man, we just want to say
we're sorry for icing you out in

04:06.209 --> 04:07.809
the past, and we'd
like your forgiveness.

04:07.877 --> 04:08.910
Yeah.

04:08.978 --> 04:11.346
Get on your knees and ask.

04:11.414 --> 04:12.080
Excuse me?

04:12.148 --> 04:13.682
Get down on your knees and ask.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.317
Show some humility, for Christ's sake.

04:16.385 --> 04:16.985
Really?

04:17.053 --> 04:18.220
Yeah.

04:18.286 --> 04:18.853
Ah, man.

04:18.921 --> 04:19.855
Whatever it takes, Schmidty.

04:19.922 --> 04:20.721
Wow, you're really doing it.

04:20.790 --> 04:21.423
I'm kidding.

04:21.491 --> 04:22.089
Ah!

04:22.158 --> 04:23.525
Oh, oh, he's joking!

04:23.593 --> 04:24.192
Oh, man!

04:24.260 --> 04:27.963
Come on, guys, have some dignity,
some respect for yourselves.

04:28.030 --> 04:28.630
You forgive us?

04:28.698 --> 04:29.364
Absolutely.

04:29.432 --> 04:30.065
Classy, Schmidty.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.066
Very classy.

04:35.738 --> 04:37.239
Dr. Myers?

04:37.306 --> 04:38.073
Yes?

04:38.141 --> 04:39.341
Hi.

04:39.408 --> 04:40.876
Dee Reynolds.

04:40.943 --> 04:42.410
I was in the school musical.

04:42.478 --> 04:43.245
Frankenstein.

04:43.312 --> 04:44.679
Yes, of course!

04:44.747 --> 04:45.280
Deandra Reynolds!

04:45.348 --> 04:46.081
Yeah!

04:46.149 --> 04:47.249
Sit, darling, sit.

04:47.316 --> 04:49.117
Thank you.

04:49.185 --> 04:54.890
Listen, I came to talk to you about high school.
I... Oh, uh...

04:54.957 --> 04:59.528
I was drinking a lot back then, so
if I did anything inappropriate...

04:59.595 --> 05:00.762
Oh, no, no, no.

05:00.830 --> 05:01.363
Not at all.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.731
In fact, the opposite.

05:02.799 --> 05:05.567
You were, like, the most
inspiring teacher I had.

05:05.635 --> 05:08.635
In fact, I-I wrote you this check
ten years ago.

05:08.755 --> 05:11.631
In hopes that I can one day give it
to you, as a thank you.

05:13.283 --> 05:15.203
May you rot in hell,

05:15.323 --> 05:16.982
- you retched beast!
- Oh...

05:17.479 --> 05:21.636
- Um, I'm confused...
- Frankenstein.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.601
That's what the villagers screamed at you,
just before you

05:24.721 --> 05:27.551
threw yourself at the funeral pier.
Aah.

05:27.671 --> 05:31.696
You were such a hideous
delight in that show.

05:31.816 --> 05:33.468
Thank you.
Yes, okay.

05:33.588 --> 05:35.021
So you're saying "don't give up",

05:35.065 --> 05:39.044
- I shouldn't give up on my dream.
- No my dear, you must give up. You must.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.268
It's far too late for you.

05:41.543 --> 05:44.020
But it's not too late to teach.

05:44.140 --> 05:47.876
Come speak to the kids, inspire them.

05:47.944 --> 05:52.180
It's an opportunity to share
your unique experiences.

05:52.248 --> 05:52.948
Uh-huh.

05:53.015 --> 05:58.086
The question is: Will you seize it?

05:58.154 --> 06:00.856
Mm...
No, thank you.

06:00.923 --> 06:01.890
Five...
What?

06:01.958 --> 06:04.025
...four, three...
No, I just never wanted to be teaching.

06:04.093 --> 06:05.026
two, one...
No offense.

06:05.094 --> 06:05.660
What are you doing?

06:05.728 --> 06:06.661
Okay, yes.

06:06.729 --> 06:08.029
And there you have it!

06:08.097 --> 06:09.731
A teacher is born.

06:10.777 --> 06:11.885
Well...

06:13.706 --> 06:15.151
Man, this is unbelievable, huh?

06:15.271 --> 06:16.638
Working at a bar, running a bar?

06:16.706 --> 06:18.540
This has got to be, like, the
greatest job ever, right?

06:18.608 --> 06:20.175
It is, man, this is what we do.

06:20.243 --> 06:21.676
Yeah, lot of dicking around, huh?

06:21.744 --> 06:24.412
Hey, um, you're still, uh,
living with your mom, huh?

06:24.480 --> 06:25.747
That sounds kind of lame.

06:25.815 --> 06:28.950
Yeah, well, I mean, it's
the MS that's really lame.

06:29.018 --> 06:29.551
You know?

06:29.619 --> 06:30.385
Oh, your mom has...?

06:30.453 --> 06:31.319
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:31.387 --> 06:32.120
She's doing all right, though.

06:32.188 --> 06:34.589
I moved in with her to take care
of her and stuff like that.

06:34.657 --> 06:37.726
It's good to really get to know her
before, you know, uh, she moves on.

06:37.793 --> 06:39.828
Oh... Kind of a downer,
that story, though.

06:39.896 --> 06:40.528
Kind of a downer.

06:40.596 --> 06:41.196
What about you, man?

06:41.264 --> 06:42.631
What's your living
situation like these days?

06:42.698 --> 06:43.265
What do you do?

06:43.332 --> 06:44.032
What are you up to?

06:44.100 --> 06:44.733
Uh, it's pretty sweet.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.233
I am.

06:45.301 --> 06:46.234
I'm his living situation.

06:46.302 --> 06:47.135
Oh, yeah?

06:47.203 --> 06:48.436
Yeah, we share a bed.

06:48.504 --> 06:49.337
Well, not every night.

06:49.405 --> 06:49.938
That's hilarious.

06:50.006 --> 06:51.606
You know, Charlie and
I used to be roomies.

06:51.674 --> 06:52.107
Yeah.

06:52.174 --> 06:53.308
Yeah, yeah, you remember that?

06:53.376 --> 06:55.477
Hey, you remember how you used
to try to get me to play all

06:55.544 --> 06:59.047
those-those lame games, you know, those
weird things you'd want to do at night?

06:59.115 --> 07:00.315
Like, uh, Night Crawlers.

07:00.383 --> 07:02.302
- I play Night Crawlers all the time.
- You do?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.603
Frank enjoys this game very much.

07:04.723 --> 07:07.528
Correct me if I'm wrong, but to make
Night Crawlers a little bit better

07:07.565 --> 07:08.810
you should use blankets, right?

07:09.090 --> 07:10.312
You take a piece of dirt.

07:10.432 --> 07:13.565
Exactly, you can use it as a force field,
or as a roaming base.

07:13.685 --> 07:16.064
Yeah, it's kind of a good idea
cause, you know,

07:16.184 --> 07:19.221
- it's an imagination based game.
- It's still imagination based.

07:20.893 --> 07:22.256
Oh, I have an idea.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.955
Dennis, remember you and Mac were
laughing when I did the butt dance?

07:26.075 --> 07:27.184
They love that when I do it.

07:27.304 --> 07:28.864
Guys, watch me, watch me, will you?

07:28.984 --> 07:30.375
Oh, yeah!

07:30.495 --> 07:32.147
5, 6, 7, 8...

07:32.267 --> 07:35.310
♪ butt, butt, butt ♪

07:35.547 --> 07:37.905
Oh, Charlie, no...

07:38.025 --> 07:40.750
- Where is this coming from?
- This is embarrassing.

07:41.956 --> 07:44.787
- Guys, be excited!
- Charlie, lemme see.

07:44.907 --> 07:46.805
You're not having fun doing this,

07:46.925 --> 07:48.552
so we're not having fun watching it, buddy.

07:48.672 --> 07:50.077
Watch, it's like this, it's like

07:50.320 --> 07:51.845
I don't know, something like

07:51.965 --> 07:54.325
♪ butt, butt, butt ♪

07:54.445 --> 07:56.895
♪ butt, butt, butt ♪

07:57.015 --> 07:59.102
♪ butt! ♪

07:59.222 --> 08:00.475
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:00.543 --> 08:01.643
Hyah!

08:03.412 --> 08:05.080
Butt dance 2.0.

08:05.147 --> 08:06.481
Butt dance 2.0.

08:06.549 --> 08:07.615
Beautiful, man.

08:07.683 --> 08:08.717
Schmitdy, know what you got?

08:08.784 --> 08:11.219
You know what you got that Charlie
doesn't really quite have?

08:11.287 --> 08:11.886
You have that "it" factor.

08:11.954 --> 08:12.587
You know what I'm saying?

08:12.655 --> 08:13.288
It's charisma.

08:13.356 --> 08:13.989
It's, like, you got it.

08:14.056 --> 08:14.990
Hey, you guys!

08:15.057 --> 08:17.926
Uh, can I talk to you in the back
office for a second real quick?

08:17.994 --> 08:19.627
I can't believe this dude.

08:19.695 --> 08:21.363
He has not changed in years, man.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.264
Look, you guys need to make
a decision right now, okay?

08:23.332 --> 08:26.234
It is either him, or it is me.

08:26.302 --> 08:27.235
Him.

08:27.303 --> 08:27.969
Yeah.

08:28.037 --> 08:29.104
I was going to say him, too.

08:29.171 --> 08:29.838
Yeah, him, him.

08:29.905 --> 08:31.406
Yeah, you know, it's always been him.

08:31.474 --> 08:34.174
I don't know why I
didn't see that before.

08:34.243 --> 08:36.264
I'm out of the gang?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.053
Him.

08:45.121 --> 08:45.666
Him.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.657
Hello, everybody.

08:52.724 --> 08:53.624
Hi, there.

08:53.692 --> 08:56.961
My name is Dee Reynolds, and not
only am I a professional actress

08:57.029 --> 09:00.531
and comedienne, uh, but I also
used to go to school here.

09:00.599 --> 09:02.266
What have you acted in?

09:02.334 --> 09:03.968
A lot of... a lot.

09:04.036 --> 09:05.603
I've acted in a lot of things.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.739
You-you may not have seen
all of them or any of them.

09:08.807 --> 09:10.575
You know, it's not time for questions.

09:10.642 --> 09:11.781
I'll let you know when
it's time for questions, though, ok?

09:11.901 --> 09:12.699
And the phone goes away.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.675
And the phone goes into your pocket
or into your backpack,

09:14.795 --> 09:17.301
but not out, in your fingers,
because I'm talking.

09:17.421 --> 09:18.452
No, I'm a'ight.

09:18.572 --> 09:20.451
Yeah, said the turkey.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.719
Uh-oh.

09:21.787 --> 09:23.187
Oh, no.

09:23.255 --> 09:24.188
Who's she?

09:24.256 --> 09:24.989
Who's she?

09:25.057 --> 09:26.824
She's somebody that'll
zing you back, right?

09:26.892 --> 09:27.658
I'll zing you.

09:27.726 --> 09:30.394
I'll zap you, I'll zing you,
so just know that about me.

09:31.597 --> 09:36.100
You know, I know that, uh, you guys
are 18 and you're seniors, and so...

09:36.168 --> 09:38.269
Okay, what is it that they're doing?

09:38.337 --> 09:39.203
What is this that they're doing?

09:39.271 --> 09:40.671
Oh, they're doing
their coughing thing.

09:40.739 --> 09:41.439
Yeah, I hear that.

09:41.506 --> 09:42.573
All right, kids, settle down.

09:42.641 --> 09:46.410
You can, uh, read, pull out
your phones, whatever.

09:46.478 --> 09:47.845
They do love their phones.

09:47.913 --> 09:48.779
What...? That's it?

09:48.847 --> 09:52.550
You're just going to sit in the corner
and hem away at your sock all day?

09:52.618 --> 09:54.418
No, where...
where is the teacher that I knew?

09:54.486 --> 09:56.169
Where is that inspirational man?

09:56.536 --> 10:01.959
My enthusiasm in those days was
fueled entirely by the alcohol.

10:02.961 --> 10:03.794
Dee, hey!

10:03.862 --> 10:05.196
Come here, come here.

10:05.264 --> 10:07.265
Charlie, what are you...
what are you doing?

10:07.332 --> 10:08.232
Got kicked out of the gang.

10:08.300 --> 10:08.933
What are you up to?

10:09.001 --> 10:09.667
You want to hang out?

10:09.735 --> 10:10.668
No, Charlie.

10:10.736 --> 10:11.569
I don't want to hang out.

10:11.637 --> 10:12.336
I-I have a job.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.906
I'm a teacher now, so I got to get
back to inspiring some students.

10:14.973 --> 10:15.640
Oh, that's pretty sweet.

10:15.707 --> 10:17.174
You want to toss some
inspiration my way, you know,

10:17.242 --> 10:19.210
'cause the guys think Schmidty's
all that and, like, I'm no good?

10:19.278 --> 10:21.045
Okay, Charlie, how about this?

10:21.246 --> 10:23.347
You are really good at cleaning
shit out of toilets and-and

10:23.415 --> 10:25.549
taking trash and throwing it
into dumpsters, so why don't you

10:25.617 --> 10:28.119
get a new job somewhere else
doing those kinds of things and

10:28.186 --> 10:29.186
make friends there, okay?

10:29.254 --> 10:31.622
Okay, Dee, so are you saying
get a job here as a janitor,

10:31.690 --> 10:33.524
and then you and I
can be best friends?

10:33.592 --> 10:35.293
That is absolutely not
what I was saying.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.894
I'm going to talk to the
principal, see if I can get that

10:36.962 --> 10:38.496
job, and then we'll work
on the friendship thing.

10:38.563 --> 10:39.230
Don't do that.

10:39.298 --> 10:40.097
No, don't do that.

10:40.165 --> 10:40.898
Charlie, don't do that.

10:40.966 --> 10:41.732
Oh, Goddamn it, don't do that.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.934
That... this is my thing.

10:43.001 --> 10:44.268
What, what, what, what, what?

10:44.336 --> 10:45.536
Here we go.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.370
Hey, all right!

10:46.438 --> 10:47.271
There's the man.

10:47.339 --> 10:48.005
What's up, buddy?

10:48.073 --> 10:48.773
This place is pretty nice.

10:48.840 --> 10:49.507
Yeah.

10:49.574 --> 10:51.670
What's going on? You guys are gonna try
and bang me afterwards or something?

10:54.444 --> 10:56.143
Very nice turn you made.

10:57.386 --> 10:59.243
Um, we only come here
for special occasions.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.875
- Yeah.
- Good, good, what's the occasion?

11:00.908 --> 11:04.746
Well we brought you to this luncheon, Schmidty,
because we want to make this official.

11:04.866 --> 11:06.019
Mac, do you have the ring?

11:06.139 --> 11:07.276
Ok, great, um...

11:07.713 --> 11:09.083
Schmidty, we, uh...

11:09.993 --> 11:12.354
We missed a lot of good, good years.

11:12.474 --> 11:14.214
- A lot of special time...
- Yeah?

11:14.478 --> 11:16.652
- ...with you. And...
- Thanks.

11:18.134 --> 11:20.711
- You know what, I don't think I can do this.
- It's alright, I'll take this.

11:20.752 --> 11:23.484
- Why is he being a big damn puss?
- Um, Schmidty...

11:23.604 --> 11:25.052
- He's emotional.
- We want you back...

11:25.401 --> 11:26.544
if you'll have this.

11:29.614 --> 11:31.167
What the hell is this shit?

11:31.435 --> 11:34.685
It's a sterling silver clover ring.

11:34.753 --> 11:37.722
When we put all four of them
together, makes a four-leaf

11:37.789 --> 11:41.726
clover, solidifying our
bond for all time.

11:41.793 --> 11:43.828
You're kidding, though, right?

11:43.895 --> 11:45.930
No, we've never been more
serious in our lives.

11:45.998 --> 11:46.931
Yeah.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.332
Yeah, whatever, I don't care.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.166
Sure.

11:49.234 --> 11:50.067
All right!

11:50.135 --> 11:50.835
He said yes!

11:50.902 --> 11:51.502
That's a yes!

11:51.570 --> 11:52.503
We bagged him.

11:52.571 --> 11:53.437
We certainly did.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.405
Oh, food's here!

11:54.473 --> 11:55.639
Food is here.

11:55.707 --> 11:56.507
Oh, no, wait, though.

11:56.575 --> 11:57.375
I didn't order yet.

11:57.442 --> 11:58.142
Oh, that's okay.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.043
I took care of the food already.

11:59.111 --> 12:00.778
Yes, Dennis orders for us.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.580
That is a humongous shrimp.

12:02.647 --> 12:04.882
Well, it's 'cause it's not a
shrimp, Frank; it's a prawn.

12:04.950 --> 12:07.051
Yeah, and I don't like prawns,
so I eat around them.

12:07.119 --> 12:09.920
Well, I'll take your prawns
if you want to take my salad.

12:09.988 --> 12:11.022
Eh.

12:11.089 --> 12:11.822
No?

12:11.890 --> 12:13.455
Okay, yeah, that's what I'll do.
Yeah, you can do that.

12:13.575 --> 12:14.881
Just put your prawns on the salad.

12:15.001 --> 12:15.996
Why don't you just order what you want?

12:16.116 --> 12:18.189
Uh, well, Dennis kind
of has the best palate.

12:18.309 --> 12:19.671
Yeah, I have the most
refined palate, Schmidty.

12:19.791 --> 12:21.041
That's just how we do things now.

12:21.161 --> 12:22.761
You've been away for a while.
It's fine.

12:22.881 --> 12:24.305
No, no, that's not
what I'm going to do.

12:24.425 --> 12:26.168
Excuse me.
Hey, come here really quick.

12:26.288 --> 12:29.373
Um, can I get, uh...
you have linguine?

12:29.441 --> 12:31.142
Yeah, can I get linguine instead?

12:31.209 --> 12:32.109
And, uh, what do you guys want?

12:32.177 --> 12:33.024
Order whatever you want.

12:33.144 --> 12:34.521
Linguine's too heavy for lunch.
No, no, what do you want?

12:34.641 --> 12:36.228
- I want fries.
- Fries for this guy.

12:36.348 --> 12:36.948
I can have fries?

12:37.068 --> 12:38.600
Oh, you don't like your
salad all of a sudden, Mac?

12:38.643 --> 12:39.939
I... Dennis, I hate salad.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.728
You hate salad?
Where is this coming from?

12:41.848 --> 12:42.920
I hate this restaurant.

12:42.988 --> 12:43.788
Yeah, this restaurant blows.

12:43.855 --> 12:44.722
I'll have a ginger ale.

12:44.790 --> 12:45.823
All right, there you go.

12:45.891 --> 12:46.957
Come on, man, get into it.

12:47.025 --> 12:48.325
I'm saying that now.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.293
Can I say that now?

12:49.361 --> 12:50.094
What?

12:50.162 --> 12:50.995
Hyah!

12:51.063 --> 12:51.862
Absolutely, take it.

12:51.897 --> 12:52.630
It's yours.

12:52.697 --> 12:53.664
By all means.

12:53.732 --> 12:54.869
What'd you get, a ginger ale?

12:58.199 --> 13:00.037
I'm a little confused.

13:00.105 --> 13:03.541
Are you telling me that this photo
of Bruce Jenner is your résumé?

13:03.608 --> 13:06.110
Well, when I showed up this
morning, I didn't have a formal

13:06.178 --> 13:09.113
résumé on me, so I was sort
of hoping the photograph of

13:09.181 --> 13:11.649
Mr. Jenner could...
could represent the standard of

13:11.716 --> 13:13.751
excellence I'm hoping to
bring to this position.

13:13.819 --> 13:16.153
I see, and you're looking for a
job as a substitute teacher?

13:16.221 --> 13:18.189
Substitute janitor, all right?

13:18.256 --> 13:20.291
Look, I'll clean this building
so good, you're not going to

13:20.358 --> 13:21.258
know what to do with yourself.

13:21.326 --> 13:22.359
You know what I mean?

13:22.427 --> 13:23.561
And I'm not a proud man.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.896
You know, I'll do the jobs that
the other guys don't want to do.

13:25.964 --> 13:26.931
I'll degrade myself.

13:26.998 --> 13:29.266
I'll make a genuine ass out of myself.

13:29.334 --> 13:30.267
Yeah.

13:30.335 --> 13:32.937
Hey, look, I'll swallow that eraser
whole just to prove it to you.

13:33.004 --> 13:33.737
Uh, no, no.

13:33.805 --> 13:34.472
Please, please, no.

13:34.539 --> 13:35.272
I'll swallow it whole.

13:35.340 --> 13:36.107
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:36.174 --> 13:38.209
You don't have to do that, but
I-I have to say, I don't think

13:38.276 --> 13:40.144
I've ever encountered someone
who's so passionate about

13:40.212 --> 13:41.612
joining our custodial staff.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.434
The passion I have for the work that I
do is extraordinary.

13:45.554 --> 13:47.213
It probably goes beyond janitor.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.127
Uh-uh.

13:48.247 --> 13:50.054
And I'm serious. I'm gonna
eat that eraser whole.

13:50.174 --> 13:52.189
Oh, no, no, it's not...
it's not necessary.

13:52.257 --> 13:53.724
You don't need to t the
eraser to prove your point.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.758
Uh, you have the job.

13:54.826 --> 13:55.759
Are you serious?

13:55.827 --> 13:56.861
I love your attitude.

13:56.928 --> 13:57.862
It's fantastic.

13:57.929 --> 13:59.497
Sir, I am not going to let you down.

13:59.564 --> 14:01.198
I mean, I'm going to start
cleaning immediately.

14:01.266 --> 14:02.133
Immediately.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.868
Uh, but first, can I eat the eraser?

14:04.236 --> 14:06.737
You're saying you want
to eat the eraser?

14:06.805 --> 14:09.807
Well, I'm asking you if it's edible
because it certainly smells of grapes.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.142
I don't think it's edible.

14:11.209 --> 14:12.343
Can I just test it?

14:12.410 --> 14:13.244
I'd rather you didn't.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.745
I kinda want... I might need it.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.613
All right.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.413
You win this one.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.848
I'll pick up one of my own.

14:17.916 --> 14:18.649
I'll eat that one.

14:18.717 --> 14:19.450
That way everybody wins.

14:19.518 --> 14:20.584
All right, well, welcome aboard.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.320
All right, all right, thanks so much.

14:27.322 --> 14:28.749
Ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

14:28.817 --> 14:30.584
I mean, where the hell is he?

14:30.652 --> 14:31.985
What did we say?

14:32.053 --> 14:33.320
We said 3:00.

14:33.388 --> 14:37.558
So we said 3:00, and it's, like...

14:37.625 --> 14:38.692
Hyah!

14:38.760 --> 14:40.461
What's crappenin', fellas?

14:40.528 --> 14:42.363
Hey, Schmidty, running
kinda late there, huh?

14:42.430 --> 14:43.364
Am I?

14:43.431 --> 14:44.565
I didn't think it mattered.

14:44.632 --> 14:45.632
How could it not matter?

14:45.700 --> 14:48.369
I mean, this is the final phase
of your initiation back into

14:48.436 --> 14:50.571
the gang, so it kinda
matters a matters a lot.

14:50.638 --> 14:51.538
It actually does.

14:51.606 --> 14:54.074
Whoa. Um, where's your ring?

14:54.142 --> 14:54.875
Oh, come on.

14:54.943 --> 14:57.578
You didn't want me to really
wear that thing, did ya?

14:57.645 --> 14:59.580
Yeah...
Oh.

14:59.647 --> 15:01.849
We're sort of sticklers for
that kind of thing, too.

15:01.916 --> 15:02.916
So pop that on.

15:02.984 --> 15:03.717
I will. Okay.

15:03.785 --> 15:04.351
Sorry about that.

15:04.419 --> 15:05.652
Time and ring. Good. Got it.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.951
Yeah.

15:07.071 --> 15:09.104
Oh! Hey, look at this!

15:09.224 --> 15:10.995
Nice setup fellas.

15:11.115 --> 15:13.894
Candles? Where did you steal
these from, huh?

15:13.962 --> 15:15.496
Uh-oh!

15:15.563 --> 15:17.431
When the hell'd you take that?

15:17.499 --> 15:18.799
Don't worry about it, Schmidty.

15:18.867 --> 15:19.867
We got to ya.

15:19.934 --> 15:21.168
This is weird as hell.

15:21.236 --> 15:22.936
You guys see that, right?

15:23.004 --> 15:24.371
What's weird about this?

15:24.439 --> 15:26.240
This is a men's ceremony, okay?

15:26.307 --> 15:30.177
They have ceremonies for
all sorts of men's clubs.

15:30.245 --> 15:32.679
Yeah, the Mafia, the
Freemasons, the White House.

15:32.747 --> 15:34.047
The White House, they do it.

15:34.115 --> 15:34.948
This is cool, okay?

15:35.016 --> 15:36.382
Trust me, what we're
doing is very cool.

15:36.411 --> 15:37.025
Okay.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.109
Mack, why don't we get started?

15:38.131 --> 15:38.948
You'll get it.

15:38.991 --> 15:40.900
He'll understand as the
ceremony progresses.

15:40.946 --> 15:43.690
All right, Schmidty, please have
a seat in the ceremonial seat.

15:43.758 --> 15:44.591
I'll do the candles.

15:44.659 --> 15:47.094
Uh, Frank, please do the candles.

15:47.162 --> 15:48.128
Dennis, the song.

15:48.196 --> 15:49.596
All right, the song.

15:55.770 --> 15:59.239
Uh, (laughs) look at that!

15:59.307 --> 16:01.909
All right, take it, take
it take it seriously.

16:01.976 --> 16:02.943
I am. I'm locked in.

16:03.011 --> 16:07.881
Okay, I will now begin the ceremony by
administering a sweet roundhouse kick

16:07.949 --> 16:09.216
to the bell.

16:09.284 --> 16:10.717
To the bell?

16:14.889 --> 16:15.989
Uh-oh, whiff!

16:16.057 --> 16:16.957
I just missed that.

16:17.025 --> 16:17.991
I just missed that.

16:19.294 --> 16:20.627
Dude, you're not even close.

16:20.695 --> 16:23.230
No, Schmidty, this is all
part of the ceremony.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.435
You gotta stretch
before this thing, huh?

16:28.503 --> 16:29.269
Enjoy it.

16:29.337 --> 16:30.871
One last crack, come on.

16:32.273 --> 16:33.474
Oh, man, this is pathetic.

16:33.541 --> 16:35.909
Here, dude, look, it goes
something like this.

16:35.977 --> 16:39.079
Hyah!

16:44.338 --> 16:45.853
I'm excited. I am.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.722
I mean, the first part of the
ceremony was a little lame, but

16:48.790 --> 16:51.191
ending it with a hot air
balloon ride, that kicks ass.

16:51.259 --> 16:52.793
Yeah, yeah, all those things.

16:52.861 --> 16:53.660
Yup.

16:53.728 --> 16:54.094
Frank, now!

16:54.162 --> 16:54.928
Push, Frank, push!

16:54.996 --> 16:55.896
Go, go, go!

16:55.964 --> 16:57.231
I got him. I got him.

16:57.298 --> 16:58.198
Come on. Stop.

16:58.266 --> 16:59.132
Get out!

16:59.200 --> 17:00.200
Come on, Frank, Frank, push him out!

17:00.268 --> 17:02.551
What are you doing, trying to push
me out of a moving car again?

17:02.671 --> 17:03.770
Yes.

17:03.838 --> 17:05.005
Goddamn it, pull over.

17:05.073 --> 17:06.138
Why are you doing this?

17:06.207 --> 17:08.259
I'll just pull over.
Good job, Frank.

17:08.378 --> 17:09.843
Tub of lard over here.

17:09.911 --> 17:12.246
Give me back the ring, all right?
'Cause you don't deserve it!

17:12.313 --> 17:13.579
- Take the ring.
- Get out of here!

17:13.647 --> 17:14.781
You're out of the gang, Schmidty!

17:14.848 --> 17:16.116
You're out of the gang, Schmidty!

17:16.184 --> 17:17.284
Get out! You're out! You're out!

17:17.352 --> 17:18.284
Okay, got it. I heard ya.
Nice seeing you guys again.

17:18.404 --> 17:19.470
Very nice meeting you.

17:19.589 --> 17:20.275
Get out of the car!

17:20.395 --> 17:22.810
I heard you.
I'm getting out, okay?

17:22.931 --> 17:24.569
Now, Dennis, peel out.

17:24.689 --> 17:27.378
I was gonna peel out and...
Don't take the steam out.

17:27.499 --> 17:30.331
Tell people we pushed you!

17:33.868 --> 17:40.641
All right, class, feel free to text or
watch movies, whatever it is you do.

17:41.576 --> 17:42.910
Not today, Doc.

17:42.977 --> 17:44.545
What are you doing, Dee?

17:44.612 --> 17:48.348
I am inspiring you.

17:48.416 --> 17:49.783
Rise and shine, dickwad.

17:49.851 --> 17:54.254
Okay, this is a great teacher,
but he is wasted on you.

17:54.322 --> 17:55.656
Well, not anymore.

17:55.723 --> 18:00.494
We're gonna be rehearsing a little
musical today called Frankenstein.

18:00.562 --> 18:01.695
This is stupid.

18:01.763 --> 18:03.630
Get out.
You're stupid, What?

18:03.698 --> 18:04.264
You heard me.

18:04.332 --> 18:05.999
You get out of here, you stupid idiot.

18:06.067 --> 18:06.833
It's fine with me.

18:06.901 --> 18:07.801
Yeah, good.

18:07.869 --> 18:11.338
And anybody else who doesn't want to be
here today, you can get out now, too.

18:11.406 --> 18:13.040
Hey, you want to go to the mall?

18:13.107 --> 18:14.474
No, no, wait. No, no, stop.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.143
Now come on, you guys!

18:16.210 --> 18:17.244
That's... Not everybody.

18:17.312 --> 18:18.045
Sit back down.

18:18.112 --> 18:19.212
That's just something people say.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.881
You guys are gonna love this.

18:20.949 --> 18:23.617
Okay, let's get started.

18:26.580 --> 18:30.691
Have you seen Dr. Frankenstein's creation
that they all speak of?

18:30.758 --> 18:35.295
Nay, I've heard tales
told of his hideousness.

18:35.363 --> 18:37.164
A monster most foul.

18:42.870 --> 18:50.043
♪ My face composed of
rotten flesh, roar, roar!

18:50.111 --> 18:56.550
♪ A hideous beast with deadly
clutch, roar, roar!

18:56.618 --> 19:09.963
♪ Another's heart beats in my chest
I'll never know a woman's touch... Roar! ♪

19:10.031 --> 19:13.397
And then I retreat into the mist
and Dr. Myers, you are Dr. Frankenstein

19:13.434 --> 19:14.989
so get up here and get acting!

19:15.109 --> 19:16.436
With pleasure, Dee!

19:16.556 --> 19:20.841
Just let me set the
loop, and here I come!

19:23.244 --> 19:27.814
Oh, whoops. That's not...
I am shattered to pieces!

19:27.882 --> 19:29.916
Are you acting right now?

19:29.984 --> 19:32.886
No, I'm not acting, you bitch!

19:32.954 --> 19:35.455
I think I've broke my hip.

19:35.523 --> 19:40.327
Why is this damn stage so slippery?

19:46.134 --> 19:47.167
Charlie boy!

19:47.235 --> 19:49.002
This floor is slippery, man.

19:49.070 --> 19:51.738
Old school slippery 'cause I
waxed it real good with this

19:51.806 --> 19:53.607
awesome power waxer that
the school provided me.

19:53.675 --> 19:55.259
I did this whole place
in, like, two hours.

19:55.379 --> 19:57.680
Oh, nice. Whoa, that's impressive.
Yeah.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.046
Dee inspired me.

19:59.113 --> 20:00.614
She said, "You're an
awesome janitor, Charlie.

20:00.682 --> 20:02.008
"You can make this whole
school slippery."

20:02.128 --> 20:03.898
I said, "Sure, I'll
give it my best shot."

20:03.900 --> 20:05.384
Then she's, like, "Let's
be best friends."

20:05.504 --> 20:07.191
And I was, like, "Sure, I'll
give that my best shot, too."

20:07.311 --> 20:08.575
So we're best friends now.

20:09.394 --> 20:12.099
Yeah, yeah, that's quite a conversation
you had with her, isn't it?

20:12.219 --> 20:13.722
Mm-hmm.
What do you guys want?

20:13.842 --> 20:17.868
Oh, well, we, uh, we came to ya
because we wanted to tell you

20:17.988 --> 20:21.520
that we're sorry for picking
Schmidty over you, and we feel

20:21.640 --> 20:24.864
like we made a big mistake,
and we want you back, buddy.

20:24.984 --> 20:28.622
And, uh, we pushed
him out of a moving car for you.

20:28.742 --> 20:30.528
I can't do it.

20:30.648 --> 20:32.138
What is wrong with you?
All right, I'll handle it.

20:32.258 --> 20:35.749
Charlie, we have an announcement
to make: it's your lucky day.

20:36.088 --> 20:37.005
We want you back.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.293
Yeah.

20:40.321 --> 20:43.423
Gotta say this is pretty
classy, guys, but I wish you

20:43.491 --> 20:47.292
gave me one of these a long time
time ago 'cause I'm a janitor now.
