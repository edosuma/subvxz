00:14.764 --> 00:15.598
Dion!

00:18.727 --> 00:22.814
I'm saying he has powers.
Okay? Weird, scary powers.

00:22.897 --> 00:23.773
<i>What the hell?</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:25.066
<i>Oh my God, no.</i>

00:26.776 --> 00:29.029
<i>I saw something last night</i>
<i>in the storm.</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:31.239
You have powers, I've always known that.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.158
That's Dad's watch.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.827
<i>There inside it</i>
<i>was a man made of lightning.</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:38.621
<i>He had long arms</i>
<i>and it was crooked-looking.</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:42.125
Look at this and tell me if this is
what you saw outside your window.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.294
<i>I named him the Crooked Man.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:47.756
Remember, whatever that thing was,
it's still out there.

00:47.839 --> 00:51.301
So I need you to be careful
and I need you to be strong.

00:51.384 --> 00:55.305
BIONA is tracking people
who were up in Iceland during the Aurora.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.932
These storms are happening
all over the world.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.101
Pat said you were asking about your dad.

01:00.185 --> 01:03.354
<i>My mom won't tell me what happened.</i>
<i>Just says it was a storm.</i>

01:03.438 --> 01:06.024
-What do you know about Charlotte Tuck?

01:06.107 --> 01:08.026
Looks like she just went off the grid.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.319
<i>You're not craz</i>y.

01:10.653 --> 01:14.741
<i>The farmer, Walter, he got his abilities</i>
<i>at the same time as me and Mark.</i>

01:15.241 --> 01:19.037
His son, Brayden,
he's second generation, like Dion.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.332
<i>Why are you helping Dion,</i>
<i>but you won't help me?</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:25.418
Remember that arctic fox we saw at BIONA?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.796
<i>The one with the weird sores?</i>

01:27.879 --> 01:29.589
<i>Not anymore. They healed.</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:34.094
I need us to be friends.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.680
-Dion!
-Mom!

01:38.306 --> 01:43.103
What if you had Mark's data? In exchange,
you let me take Dion home now.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.106
<i>You think Dion can heal you</i>
<i>like he healed that fox?</i>

01:46.189 --> 01:48.608
-You made him try to heal you!
-Hey!

01:49.192 --> 01:52.946
I didn't do anything!
He wanted to help me, because he loves me.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.157
Pat is the storm. He turned into a cyclone
right in front of me.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.784
<i>He is the Crooked Man!</i>

02:04.874 --> 02:06.292
<i>Energy never dies.</i>

02:08.253 --> 02:09.838
<i>It just takes a different form.</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:33.319
<i>Good will always triumph over evil.</i>

02:37.365 --> 02:38.283
Yes.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.964
<i>Your evil is no match for my fists.</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:57.844
<i>Good will always triumph over--</i>

02:58.344 --> 03:00.388
-Yes!

03:00.471 --> 03:02.807
<i>You lose.</i>

03:27.290 --> 03:28.166
Done for the day?

03:30.960 --> 03:33.755
-Are you here by yourself?
-My parents are picking me up outside.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.095
Okay, you have 20,000 tickets.
What's it gonna be?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.608
Sorry, you don't have enough for that one.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.486
I have enough.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.742
You have enough.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.435
You didn't have to kill him.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.944


06:33.684 --> 06:37.647
Hi. Sweetie, are-are you okay?
Are you lost?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.982
I need a ride to Atlanta.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.945
I'm sorry, we're not going to Atlanta,
but we can drop you off somewhere else.

06:44.028 --> 06:44.946
Somewhere safe.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.157
You're going to Atlanta.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.958
-We're going to Atlanta.
-Hop on in.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.640
Why are we going to Atlanta?

07:14.559 --> 07:15.935
That's where Dion is.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.914
Hey, wake up, Bug.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.334
Hello, good morning.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.421
I have a call with the BIONA
board of directors in a few minutes,

07:43.504 --> 07:45.131
so I'll be in the dining room.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.424
Please be quiet.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.718
You have 30 minutes
to get ready for school, okay?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.749
Hmm.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.171
Mm-hmm.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.394
Thirty minutes. Start the clock.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.484
Giving you 25. Hold for logistics.

08:50.863 --> 08:51.822
Go for maps.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.912
Time to clean up the neighborhood.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.666
<i>Welcome to our special guest,</i>
<i>Nicole Warren</i>.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.752
<i>Nicole has allowed us to continue</i>
<i>her late husband's researc</i>h

09:04.835 --> 09:06.128
<i>into the Powered.</i>

09:06.212 --> 09:10.508
<i>She is also the mother of our only</i>
<i>second-generation subject,</i> <i>Dion Warren.</i>

09:10.591 --> 09:13.427
<i>She is a great collaborator.</i>
<i>A great friend.</i>

09:14.262 --> 09:15.846
Thank you, Suzanne.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.683
I am so proud of Mark's legacy.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.394
And the new research center
is doing so much good.

09:22.603 --> 09:26.190
I just wish I had something like that
when I first realized Dion had powers.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.651
<i>I look forward</i>
<i>to when it doesn't have to be secret.</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:32.113
<i>But for now,</i> <i>we want to help the Powered</i>
<i>stay under the radar and safe</i>

09:32.196 --> 09:34.699
<i>while we figure out</i>
<i>how to introduce them to the world.</i>

09:34.782 --> 09:36.534
<i>And to speak more on that,</i>

09:36.617 --> 09:39.829
<i>I'll turn it over to my boss,</i>
<i>Ben Cutler, chairman of the board.</i>

09:39.912 --> 09:43.749
<i>Well, first things first, Ms. Warren,</i>
<i>your extraordinary son.</i>

09:43.833 --> 09:45.334
<i>-How is our little star?</i>
Ooh.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.545
Don't call him that.
I have to live with him.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.339
I'm serious.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.140
Trash cans are open again.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.142
Some people never learn.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.268
Da-da!

10:04.103 --> 10:06.022
-Got 'em.
-Good work, Mind Mover.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.736
We need a new paperboy.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.159
Yes!

10:29.503 --> 10:32.048
Want something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.550
Did I lose you?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.012
Oh, no!

10:42.516 --> 10:43.351
Got it.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.853
Are you there, Mind Mover?

10:45.936 --> 10:48.022
-<i>Dropped my phone.</i>
-Again?

10:48.105 --> 10:50.524
<i>Your mom's gonna kill you</i>
<i>if you lose that phone.</i>

10:50.608 --> 10:52.485
-Let's start wrapping it up.
-Already?

10:52.568 --> 10:55.237
Who's the time keeper here?
Let's get you back home.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.662
Come on. Give it.
Come on, give me my ball.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.746
Come on, give it back.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.624
-You can't get it. Ha! You can't get it.
-Give it. Come on.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.460
Our Powered subjects
come to us voluntarily.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.672
Their participation allows us
to do valuable research,

11:12.755 --> 11:14.840
so we want to make sure
they feel safe here.

11:15.758 --> 11:20.054
Nicole, we'd like to offer you a seat
on BIONA's new community advisory board.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.849
It will meet once a month to discuss
and recommend policies for the company.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.478
Wow, I… I don't know what to say.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.230
<i>We think you'll provide invaluable insight</i>

11:29.313 --> 11:31.107
<i>into the concerns</i>
<i>of the Powered community.</i>

11:31.190 --> 11:34.735
Oh, I can only speak from my own
experiences. I'm not a Powered person.

11:34.819 --> 11:35.945
<i>But your son is.</i>

11:36.028 --> 11:39.281
<i>See, you occupy a unique position</i>
<i>between both worlds.</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:45.162
<i>Ms. Warren?</i>

11:45.913 --> 11:47.456
<i>Mind Mover, what's your 20?</i>

11:47.540 --> 11:51.085
-Mr. Govan's building. Bullies are back.
-<i>Two-minute warning!</i>

11:51.168 --> 11:53.796
-Bring it back!
-They got his basketball.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.092
They crossed onto Hawthorne Avenue.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.677
That's out of your jurisdiction.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.680
You can't teleport there.
Somebody might see you.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.018
We don't have time for this.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.691
-I can't let them get away.
-Thirty seconds, Di. Abort, abort!

12:22.533 --> 12:23.367
I'm back.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.494
Twenty seconds to spare.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.205
You'll get 'em next time, Mind Mover.
Signing off.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.541
-Enjoy your little adventure?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.712
-How--
-Tracked your phone.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.005
You can do that?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.715
Keep this up, I'm taking it away.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.968
I'm taking care of the neighborhood, Mom.
We've got bullies out there.

12:41.051 --> 12:45.014
Your job is to go to school
and be a good kid. Not fight crime.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.557
I'm a superhero.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.808
You're ten.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.895
Now change out of that
and let's have a quick breakfast.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.731
And pack a gym bag
because today's a BIONA day.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.903
I'm a superhero.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.501
When are you gonna let me
ride my bike to school?

13:14.084 --> 13:16.879
-We've had this conversation.
-It's embarrassing.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.173
Kids my age ride their bikes places.

13:19.256 --> 13:22.134
And if you were like any other kid,
I'd probably let you.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.804
Nobody's gonna mess with me.
If they tried, I'd zap them.

13:24.887 --> 13:28.516
Exactly. You'd use your powers
as a first resort, not your last.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.728
You could hurt somebody.
And you could possibly be found out.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.315
-You're not letting me be awesome.
-One step at a time, Bug.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.567
That's why you're getting
training at BIONA,

13:38.651 --> 13:40.820
so you can learn
how to control your powers.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.364
Margaret just asks me questions
and takes notes.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.199
It's like she's babysitting me.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.496
Dad said that thing was still out there.
He said I'm gonna have to fight it.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.541
-That's not exactly what he said.
-He told me to be brave and ready.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.334
He also told you to listen to me.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.169
I fought the Crooked Man.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.713
He exploded right out there
on the football field.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.007
<i>We</i> fought the Crooked Man.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.592
<i>With</i> your dad's help.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.807
I know you want to grow up
and take on the world all by yourself,

14:09.890 --> 14:12.017
but you have the rest of your life
to do that.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.854
Everything is

14:15.729 --> 14:16.814
under control.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.776
So just be a kid
while you can still be a kid.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.322
Hey.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.967
If Dion's not here in two minutes,
we're gonna have to reschedule.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.469
-Okay.
-It's not okay.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.930
We need to have this meeting
before school.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.601
Mr. Gary. Mr. Gary.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.856
Hey, Esperanza.
What you got going on, little lady?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.692
I want to show you something.
I've been looking for you since last week.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.445
Oh, well, they got me working
on night shift now,

15:46.528 --> 15:48.697
ever since that sinkhole opened up
on the football field.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.908
I'm heading home to get some rest.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.786
Look. I planted the snowdrops
and they came up already.

15:55.496 --> 15:59.458
Let me see what you got here.
Wow. This is great.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.255
-It actually looks better than mine.
-But your pansies were way better.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.466
Nah. You just need
some slug traps, that's it.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.802
Did your father set those up for you?

16:10.386 --> 16:15.307
Nah. He travels for work a lot.
Doesn't have time for the garden.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.687
I mean, you've done good on your own.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.441
Tell you what.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.820
How about I get some slug traps,
help you set 'em up,

16:27.903 --> 16:29.822
and your pansies
will be blooming in no time.

16:29.905 --> 16:30.906
That would be great.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.826
All right. You got a deal.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.786
-See you soon.
-Bye.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.121
All right, have a good one.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.373
Sorry I'm late.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.667
The Triangle of Justice is now in session.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.420
-Role call. Mind Mover?
-Here.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.547
Invisible Girl. Here.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.926
-Did you settle on a name yet?
-Admiral Annihilation.

16:52.094 --> 16:56.765
We'll work on that.
Okay, time for daily reports. Mind Mover?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.768
It was all good,
until the bullies got away.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.604
-Admiral Killing Guy?
-Annihilation.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.690
A car was stolen in my neighborhood.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.567
Do you think the bullies were involved?

17:06.650 --> 17:09.194
-Were they driving a Toyota Camry?
-No.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.946
-Let's do it.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.908
Three Become One!
We're stronger together!

17:14.992 --> 17:17.953
Triangle of Justice!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.289
-Let's all have a good day and stay safe.
-Copy that.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.749
Oh, one more thing.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.752
I signed us all up
for the school musical revue.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.880
-What?
-We'll all be in the chorus.

17:27.963 --> 17:31.258
-Theme is American folk songs.
-I don't want to do a musical revue!

17:31.341 --> 17:32.176
Me neither.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.636
We do everything together, remember?
Three Become One?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.306
-Yeah, but--
-We all went to Jonathan's tractor pull.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.308
-That was cool.
-Yeah, exactly.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.393
And we went to Dragon Con for you.

17:41.477 --> 17:45.105
Not to mention, fighting an electric
monster on the football field.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.983
-What? Uh--
-I'm invoking the Power of the Triangle.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.777
What? I was…

17:50.444 --> 17:51.945
No!

17:53.280 --> 17:55.282
Sorry, dude. It's out of our hands.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.622
Yeah, I'll get that back to you by Friday.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.501
-That's a little soon, actually.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.087
Um, sure. Thursday. Thursday's fine.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.047
Hey, Kwame.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.508
Where are my mock-ups for the PR campaign?

18:12.591 --> 18:16.136
You'll get it in a couple days.
I have three jobs due before yours.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.348
<i>I made you a graphic designer.</i>
<i>I put you in business.</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:22.184
And I would love it
if you paid all of my bills.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.811
I'm not rich.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.105
<i>That is why</i>
<i>I've got to keep hustling.</i>

18:26.188 --> 18:27.773
Do you actually need it,

18:27.856 --> 18:30.526
or are you just checking things
off your list because you're bored?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.445
Bored.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.240
That's what I thought.
I'll get it to you in a couple days.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.867
I could come over and we could blue-sky
some ideas off each other,

18:38.951 --> 18:40.244
bounce things back and forth.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.454
<i>Ah, we could watch </i>The Queen's Gambit.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.540
-Goodbye, Kwame.
<i>I'll bring a bottle of wi--</i>

18:53.507 --> 18:56.093
All right, before we get started,

18:56.969 --> 19:01.265
apparently some of you are still
trying to sneak down to that sinkhole.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.352
The principal told me to say,
one more time,

19:06.019 --> 19:08.188
that place is off-limits.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.275
It's been open for three months.
Why don't they just cover it up?

19:11.358 --> 19:14.361
They're testing the soil. There might be
some toxic waste under there.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.447
-Cool.
-No, Chris. It is not cool.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.284
Stay away from it.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.162
That land's been shifting around a lot

19:23.245 --> 19:26.498
ever since that freak electrical storm
a couple of years ago, okay?

19:27.541 --> 19:29.293
But, on the bright side,

19:29.376 --> 19:33.213
there have been some interesting artifacts
that have come out of that hole.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.716
-Are they toxic?
-Sorry to disappoint you, Steffi.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.969
But all of this has been
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.222
We have an arrowhead.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.265
-What?
-Whoa!

19:43.348 --> 19:45.559
Petrified piece of wood.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.311
Awesome.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.979
Old pieces of metal.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.439
Are those real?

19:51.023 --> 19:51.899
And

19:52.733 --> 19:54.651
some tiny musket balls.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.236
-No way.
-Those are actually real?

19:56.320 --> 19:59.198
A battle was fought
on this property during the Civil War.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.450
The land has a story to tell.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.370
Okay, so we're gonna create
a time line of this area.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.247
-Starting just before the--

20:13.921 --> 20:15.005
Come on in.

20:17.007 --> 20:20.761
All right, class.
We've got a brand new student to welcome.

20:20.844 --> 20:24.723
-Everyone welcome Brayden Mills.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.981
<i>Is that kid staring at me?</i>

20:34.399 --> 20:36.818
-<i>What kind of name is Brayden?</i>
<i>He looks weird.</i>

20:36.902 --> 20:38.528
<i>Please don't put him in my group.</i>

20:38.612 --> 20:40.822
<i>His hair looks greasy.</i>
-<i>And those boots.</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:13.272
-Is that you trying to whistle?
-My lips are so dry.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.317
Esperanza's forcing me
to be in the musical revue.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.903
Esperanza can't force you to do anything.

21:19.987 --> 21:23.115
She invoked the Power
of the Triangle. There's nothing I can do.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.032
Okay.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.744
Unless you tell her I can't?

21:27.828 --> 21:29.663
I'm not lying to Esperanza for you.

21:31.415 --> 21:35.919
Besides, I love musicals.
And I loved them so much when I was a kid.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.465
Maybe that's why
the school asked me to direct the revue.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.011
No! You can't do that!

21:44.094 --> 21:46.722
-Why not?
-It's too embarrassing.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.974
Don't do it. Please don't do it.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.642
Okay! Okay, jeez.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.854
You know, maybe I can get
Kwame to direct it.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.023
Hi. He loves musicals.

21:57.232 --> 22:02.738
He did a bus-and-truck tour of <i>Dreamgirls</i>,
and he would not stop talking about it.

22:03.947 --> 22:04.823
Okay, never mind.

22:04.906 --> 22:10.454
You know, I promise not to embarrass you
by being your mother at school.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.538
Thank you.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.171
-Hey, Fernando.
-Hey, Dion, what's up?

22:19.254 --> 22:20.088
Nothing.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.298
-How's it going?
-Good.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.593
-Helping your dad today?
-He's got me running around.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.510
How's the band?

22:26.219 --> 22:30.223
We, uh, actually got a gig this Saturday,
but-but don't tell my dad, please.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.184
-Okay.
-Awesome. Hey, see you around.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.143
See ya.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.356
There you go.
Control your breathing.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.693
Good. Now focus where you want it to go.

22:42.819 --> 22:43.653
Excellent.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.538
Hey, Marla, I bet you're calling
about those drawings.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.999
Janelle, are you listening?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.251
Can you please cooperate?

22:58.335 --> 22:59.961
-Janelle.
-Listen to him.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.672
You have to focus.
You can do this. I know you--

23:02.756 --> 23:03.715
Oh!

23:05.300 --> 23:07.969
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with her, Alonso.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.388
We can figure this out.

23:10.931 --> 23:11.848
Calm down.

23:21.691 --> 23:24.945
Hey, Dion, why don't you change
and I'll meet you in the training room?

23:26.822 --> 23:29.157
Sure, yeah, I have time to talk.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.119
Mm-hmm.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.372
<i>Thank you for the feedback.</i>

23:35.956 --> 23:39.167
No, the ornate panels
will go on the sides.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.295
If you want something different from
the bottom, we're gonna have to rethink.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.089
But we…

23:45.799 --> 23:47.217
No, uh…

23:47.300 --> 23:49.469
We'll have to rethink the whole layout.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.850
I-I hear you, but we don't have
enough space to work with.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.561
-Um, oh, I'm sorry.
-No, go ahead.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.771
I understand. It'll just…
It'll be too crowded.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.984
Uh, Marla, please, can I call you back?
Thank you.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.862
I'm so rude being on my phone.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.197
-Please, I insist, go ahead.
-You sure?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.116
-Yes, I'm sure.
-'Cause I can wait.

24:11.199 --> 24:14.035
-I really need coffee, so if you could--
-Got it. Here I go.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.205
Busy day?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.499
Everyone wants what they want
and they want it now.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.627
-Honestly, I could've waited.
-No.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.755
Thank you. Um, not you. My clients.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.718
They want your attention.
Can't say I blame them for that.

24:31.178 --> 24:34.639
Well, I'm sure there are plenty of people
vying for your attention.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.902
-You okay?
-You're Powered.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.198
-Did it just get cold in here?
-I didn't realize.

24:51.698 --> 24:52.741
Is there a problem?

24:54.576 --> 24:57.496
No, I just…
I have to go. My son's training.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.415
You got something against Powered people?

25:00.499 --> 25:03.210
You are standing in the middle
of the Powered Research Center.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.711
Kind of figured you were Powered.

25:05.212 --> 25:09.299
-I'm not. I mean, I love Powered people.
-Some of your best friends are Powered.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.219
I just don't want to get involved
with a Powered man.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.386
Were we getting involved?

25:14.930 --> 25:17.098
I'm sorry. I-I…
I didn't mean to offend you.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.643
Why would I be offended?
You just don't like my kind.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.313
Okay. I have my reasons
and I have every right.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.481
Oh, you have every right?

25:29.986 --> 25:31.363
What was that for?

25:31.947 --> 25:34.074
I didn't want to offend you
with my powers.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.472
Why are you following me?

25:57.973 --> 25:58.807
I'm not.

26:01.309 --> 26:04.187
-It kinda feels like you're following me.
-I'm not.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.481
If you wanted my number,
you could've just asked.

26:06.982 --> 26:07.857
That's my son.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.068
-Hi-yah!
-Oh, uh…

26:10.652 --> 26:13.321
-Dion. What's up, man?
-What's up?

26:13.405 --> 26:16.533
-I'm Tevin, your new trainer.
-I didn't know he had a new trainer.

26:16.616 --> 26:20.120
-Yeah, um, Suzanne Wu was supposed to--
-Di, hold on one second.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.582
She's mad at you.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.750
Yeah, I got that.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.884
What you've accomplished
is nothing short of miraculous, Suzanne.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.428
Thank you, David.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.888
Seriously, I always knew
you were a talented scientist,

26:38.972 --> 26:40.265
but this, this takes vision.

26:40.348 --> 26:43.351
Well, studying Powered people
wasn't part of our original mission,

26:43.435 --> 26:47.731
but with all we know,
it would be irresponsible not to.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.732
Yeah, 100%.

26:49.691 --> 26:52.861
When we figure out how
to harness Powered DNA, I mean…

26:52.944 --> 26:53.987
Can you imagine?

26:54.070 --> 26:57.198
I mean, if you still had the farmer,
we could end world hunger.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.326
Oh, o-okay. Slow down.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.703
We're here to help these people,
not exploit them.

27:02.662 --> 27:06.416
Of course, but as a scientist,
I mean, you have to see the possibilities.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.044
I see a slippery slope,

27:09.127 --> 27:12.297
so, let's stay focused
on our current mission.

27:13.006 --> 27:16.468
Reversing the necrosis at sites
where the Crooked Man touched down.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.888
"The Crooked Man."
What is that, some kind of code name?

27:19.971 --> 27:23.224
Oh, sorry. It's what Dion called
Pat Rollins in his Powered form.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.644
"Crooked," like lightning.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.021
Right.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.274
Well, the Crooked Man got around.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.901
The satellite found two additional sites

27:32.984 --> 27:35.612
that need to be secured,
one in Morocco and another in Rome.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.531
-When did they appear?
-Three months ago, like all the rest.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.158
Standard cover story?

27:40.241 --> 27:43.495
Toxic waste site.
BIONA to the rescue, saving the planet.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.414
Get me a proposal
and I'll authorize the money.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.293
-What?
-Hm? No, nothing.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.464
I mean, it's funny,
you know, you're my boss.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.509
Is that gonna be a problem?

27:58.760 --> 27:59.678
No.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.390
Honestly, not a problem at all.
We're good.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.307
Okay.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.644
In fact, let's have a drink after work.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.230
To prove how good we are.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.732
Yeah, I don't think that, um--

28:13.316 --> 28:14.943
-Suzanne?
-Nicole.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.695
Uh, I was just coming down to see you.

28:16.778 --> 28:20.532
But first, meet David Marsh,
the new VP of Operations.

28:20.615 --> 28:24.953
He came to us from International,
but we used to work together.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.204
-We did.
-Nice to meet you.

28:26.287 --> 28:29.624
Such an honor to meet you, Ms. Warren.
Your son is extraordinary.

28:34.337 --> 28:37.006
But you know that. And I'm gonna go.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.556
Dion has a new trainer?

28:44.639 --> 28:48.017
Margaret was way out of her league. Dion
needs a trainer who can keep up with him.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.270
He's a Powered person, Suzanne.

28:50.353 --> 28:53.940
He's also a world-class runner,
a former Olympic track coach,

28:54.023 --> 28:56.443
and you know what he's not? Pat.

28:57.444 --> 29:01.364
He has powers that I don't have.
That… It makes me nervous.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.951
I know, but we can't
keep ignoring the obvious.

29:05.034 --> 29:08.329
Dion is growing up.
An eight-year-old listens to his mom.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.623
A ten-year-old
starts listening to his friends.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.627
We need somebody
that Dion will look up to. A role model.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.756
-Tevin can be that guy.
-He sprayed milk on me.

29:17.839 --> 29:18.673
What?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.134
Well, he didn't,
but he could've stopped it.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.428
What are you talking about?

29:24.971 --> 29:26.848
You have a broken cappuccino machine.

29:28.975 --> 29:31.060
I will get right on that.

29:37.817 --> 29:40.904
-More sinkholes?
-Found two more today.

29:43.031 --> 29:46.576
Did they open up about the same time
as the one behind Dion's school?

29:46.659 --> 29:47.535
Three months ago.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.498
What the hell happened three months ago?

29:52.916 --> 29:54.000
Good question.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.378
You gonna trust me about Tevin?

29:57.879 --> 30:00.340
I mean, we did fight
a supernatural monster together.

30:00.423 --> 30:04.552
You fought? Because I'm pretty sure
you got knocked out immediately.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.180
Oh, wow. You're gonna
do me like that, are you?

30:08.723 --> 30:10.016
Okay.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.566
-Fireballs?
-Yup.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.777
-Teleportation?
-Check.

30:20.860 --> 30:24.781
-Okay. Invisibility?
-Yup. But it is still just my hand.

30:25.573 --> 30:28.993
-That still counts. Intangibility?
-You mean like this?

30:34.249 --> 30:35.792
What the heck is that?

30:36.709 --> 30:39.003
I don't know.
I didn't know what the word meant.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.839
So you just made up a power?

30:44.300 --> 30:45.134
Okay.

30:48.471 --> 30:51.599
Is that it? You're just gonna
ask a bunch of questions?

30:53.351 --> 30:54.352
Let's see you in action.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.483
What else you got?

31:07.323 --> 31:08.157
'Sup, bro?

31:27.302 --> 31:28.386
Dion.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.139
-Whoa!
-What are you doing?

31:34.183 --> 31:36.644
Dion, take a break. Let me talk to Tevin.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.563
-Uh, can I play on my phone?
-Sure.

31:39.063 --> 31:39.898
Yes!

31:40.398 --> 31:42.233
Stay still. Just let her talk.

31:45.945 --> 31:48.781
I, uh… promise I had that under control.

31:48.865 --> 31:52.535
Yeah, obviously, or my face and hair
would have been burned off.

31:54.621 --> 31:55.455
Um,

31:57.206 --> 31:59.876
I'm sorry for how I acted.

32:00.835 --> 32:03.379
I had a bad experience with a Powered guy.

32:03.463 --> 32:06.215
Actually, bad doesn't even begin
to cover it.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.093
It was traumatic, both for me and Dion.

32:09.969 --> 32:13.306
I let him get close
and he almost destroyed us.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.100
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah, me too.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.270
But Suzanne reminded me that he's not you,

32:19.979 --> 32:20.939
and he's long gone.

32:23.399 --> 32:26.402
I, uh, really regret
letting you get sprayed with milk.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.323
No, seriously.
I used my powers to make a point.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.242
-That was wrong.
-It was kind of funny.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.372
-Yeah?
-I mean, not in the moment.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.373
But I see it now.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.502
Clean slate?

32:44.671 --> 32:45.505
Clean slate.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.847
He's safe with me. I promise.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.059
You both are.

33:26.587 --> 33:28.339
So this
is where you fought Dion?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.299
Yes.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.720
But you couldn't beat him.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.891
This time,
I'm bringing an army.

33:38.975 --> 33:39.809
How?

34:28.441 --> 34:30.693
Hey! What are you doing out here, kid?

34:37.575 --> 34:40.703
-You're not supposed to be out here.
-You're sleepy.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.637
I missed you.
Oh my God, don't choke me to death!

34:57.720 --> 35:00.890
Why didn't you tell somebody?
I would've picked you up from the airport.

35:00.973 --> 35:04.811
Oh, girl, I stopped making plans,
like, three months into my trip.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.980
-You look so good.
-Thank you. So do you.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.190
Look at your place.

35:09.273 --> 35:14.112
-So tell me everything. How was Ghana?
-It was… life-changing.

35:14.195 --> 35:19.117
-Auntie Kat! You're home!
-Hey, Bug! Look at you. You're so big.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.620
I brought you a ton of souvenirs, but
I need to figure out which bag they're in.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.039
Oh, no, tomorrow.
It's late. It's time for bed.

35:25.581 --> 35:29.001
-But I have to make my video for Dad.
-Okay, make it quickly.

35:29.752 --> 35:32.088
-Now, what have you got to drink?
-Everything.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.548
Come on. Catch me up.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.509
-What are you looking for?
-My phone.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.302
Did you lose your phone?

35:38.803 --> 35:42.473
-No, it's in my backpack.
-You better not lose that phone.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.059
-I didn't. Night, everyone.
-Night, sweetie.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.855
He's still doing that?
Making those videos for Mark?

35:48.938 --> 35:51.774
If Mark comes back, he wants
to be able to catch him up on everything.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.402
Mark's not coming back, Nic. He's dead.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.363
I know. And to some degree,
I think he knows that too.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.741
It's just how he's dealing with it
for right now, but… Mm!

36:00.825 --> 36:02.660
I missed you so much.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.836
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:14.380 --> 36:17.008
Oh, Pinchy. Where's my phone?

36:18.593 --> 36:21.637
I had it after school.
I had it with Tevin.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.266
BIONA. I had it
when I was working with Tevin!

36:27.310 --> 36:30.813
Liquid dinner
is my favorite. Thank you.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.691
I love this. Can I have one?

36:33.774 --> 36:36.485
Sorry, I would give you this one,
but it was given to me.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.447
-Ah. Who is she?
-A girl I met.

36:39.530 --> 36:43.326
Um, excuse me,
how many girls did you--

36:43.409 --> 36:46.495
I have to.
Mom will kill me if I've lost that phone.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.291
BIONA's not that far. I can make it.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.128
Yes, I can. I'll be right back.

37:00.885 --> 37:01.719
Wait.

37:05.598 --> 37:06.432
Yes!

37:20.029 --> 37:22.323
-I was making up for lost time.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.368
How about you?
You meet anybody while I was gone?

37:25.451 --> 37:27.745
Or do I need to sign you up
for all the dating apps?

37:27.828 --> 37:31.749
Well, actually,
Dion has a new trainer. Tevin.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.001
Tevin. Come and talk to me.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.461
-Yes.
-Is he fine?

37:35.544 --> 37:36.671
-Fine.
-He fine.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.257
-He fine.
-Ooh, yes, girl, he's fine!

37:39.340 --> 37:42.969
Why'd you come here with all your stuff?
Why didn't you go straight home?

37:43.052 --> 37:44.720
I sold it while I was gone.

37:45.304 --> 37:49.725
-You did? You took the offer.
-I did, I did. I got the money.

37:49.809 --> 37:50.768
Okay.

37:54.563 --> 37:55.731
Where are you gonna stay?

37:57.650 --> 38:01.153
Here, for now.
Oh my gosh, girl. We are out of wine.

38:01.237 --> 38:05.658
And I am hung-a-ry.
You got something to eat in here?

38:07.868 --> 38:10.454
Crispix? Who eats that?

38:12.915 --> 38:14.959
Suzanne. Hey, hey, wait up.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.630
It's late, David. I've got to get home.

38:19.714 --> 38:23.217
The readings at the Atlanta sinkhole
are spiking at levels never seen before.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.552
-Just Atlanta?
-Yes.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.305
The others are stable, but Atlanta
looks like a bomb is going off.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.308
Did you call the tech on duty?
He's monitoring from the van. He should--

38:30.391 --> 38:32.768
I've been trying to reach him.
He's not answering.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.739
BIONA's finest.

39:30.659 --> 39:34.205
We're gonna need
to see some ID. Hey. Call for backup.

39:59.855 --> 40:00.773
Still nothing.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.400
Get down there.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.319
Call me as soon as you see
what's happening, and tell no one.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.570
The public can't know.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.489
<i>Alert. Facility breach.</i>

40:08.572 --> 40:11.951
<i>All available security</i>
<i>report to the main entrance.</i>

40:12.034 --> 40:13.828
<i>-Alert. Facility breach.</i>

40:19.208 --> 40:21.252
Yes, I got my phone.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.505
Something weird is going on
at the sinkhole, Pinchy.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.475
-Oh my God.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.519
Oh my God.

40:40.688 --> 40:41.647
Look at this.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.210
Ah, better get this.
Esperanza's not gonna believe this.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.964
She is not gonna believe it.
Oh my God.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.023
Hands in the air!

41:24.690 --> 41:25.691
Take the right side.

41:27.860 --> 41:28.736
Don't move!

41:30.446 --> 41:31.489
Hands where we can see 'em!

41:36.076 --> 41:37.286
What's going on here?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.292
Pat.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.759
-H-How?
-I-I-I don't have powers anymore.

41:52.801 --> 41:53.677
I'm here to help.

41:54.261 --> 41:55.137
Help?

41:57.306 --> 42:00.267
You gotta believe me, Suzanne.
Something terrible is coming.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.481
Drop to your knees now!
