27:54.063 --> 27:55.412
that I can feel from here,

27:55.456 --> 27:56.979
I cannot!

27:57.023 --> 27:59.416
'Cause we all know that this
month has been killing you.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.549
- It has not.
- Oh!

28:01.592 --> 28:03.203
You've been crawling
out of your skin

28:03.246 --> 28:05.771
like a frog in a slow boil,
baby.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.077
- She's not wrong.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.166
- Oh, great. You too?
Pile it on.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.559
- Oh, it's all so banal,

28:11.602 --> 28:14.562
the PTA, the playdates,
the yoga!

28:14.605 --> 28:16.956
Each day, the flame
grows a little hotter.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.045
- She's been missing
that hood life!

28:19.088 --> 28:21.874
- Right?

28:21.917 --> 28:23.527
Peace.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.053
- Whoa, whoa, wait, you're just
gonna leave us here with this?

28:27.096 --> 28:28.837
- You know what?
I did my part.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.621
You handle this.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.624
[door opens]

28:35.061 --> 28:36.802
- Wait, wait, wait,
you're leaving too?

28:36.845 --> 28:39.108
- I gotta haul Sara's fast ass
down to the station

28:39.152 --> 28:40.719
and scare her straight.
- Why?

28:40.762 --> 28:42.416
- 'Cause that little heifer
has been slinging

28:42.459 --> 28:44.723
stolen fidget spinners
on the playground.

28:44.766 --> 28:45.854
- Sara?

28:45.898 --> 28:47.595
- Like mother, like daughter,
I guess.

28:47.638 --> 28:50.511
- Hey, you know that's not
the reason why.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.470
- Yeah, right.

28:54.950 --> 28:55.995
Love you.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.300
- Love you.

28:57.344 --> 28:59.041
[door opens]

28:59.085 --> 29:00.782
- So you just want me
to scare her a little, right?

29:00.826 --> 29:03.045
- I want you to put
the fear of God in her.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.786
Cuff her, Tase her,
pepper spray,

29:04.830 --> 29:05.787
whatever it takes.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.094
- [laughs]

29:08.137 --> 29:10.836
- I'm dead serious.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.925
- Look, I get it.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.622
I worry about my kid, too.

29:14.665 --> 29:18.104
She's gonna be fine;
you guys are great parents.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.193
She has good role models.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.151
- Yeah, right.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.941
- You ready to see
how this works?

29:28.984 --> 29:30.333
- Do I have to?

29:30.377 --> 29:31.900
- She's ready.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.336
- You like bunk beds, Sara?

29:33.380 --> 29:35.643
- Oh, she's been begging us
for bunk beds.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.340
Is that right?

29:37.384 --> 29:39.516
- I want you to think of this
as an opportunity

29:39.560 --> 29:41.780
to grow during the downtime.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.347
A chance to really
flip your game,

29:44.391 --> 29:48.221
in a way that, if it's not
completely legal,

29:48.264 --> 29:51.311
it is totally FDA-approved.
- Mm-hmm.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.313
- This is essentially
liquid money.

29:53.356 --> 29:57.012
I mean, it's literally liquid,
but...

29:57.056 --> 29:59.493
- It's garbage.
This stuff's poison.

29:59.536 --> 30:02.409
- Not any more so than
the substances your guys deal.

30:02.452 --> 30:03.976
- Who would I even sell it to?

30:04.019 --> 30:05.412
- Don't you know someone?

30:05.455 --> 30:07.196
- That rolls with a bunch
of middle-aged ladies?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.546
Nah, man, not so much.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.248
How's your rotten egg?

30:16.423 --> 30:17.511
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.861
- You said you handled it.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.471
- I did.

30:21.515 --> 30:23.865
- Then why you trying to play
me with this side-hustle stuff?

30:23.909 --> 30:26.085
I told you, we're shut down.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.651
- And I told you
I have expenses.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.828
I have four children,
a mortgage,

30:29.871 --> 30:32.091
I can't just shut down--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.266
She got you on the hook,
now, right?

30:33.309 --> 30:35.311
- I said I'm handling it!

30:39.968 --> 30:41.056
- Okay.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.580
[laughs]

30:43.624 --> 30:45.887
You think you're a boss,
now, huh?

30:45.931 --> 30:48.368
Your lily ass does two jobs
and all of the sudden,

30:48.411 --> 30:50.283
you think you
run the whole game?

30:50.326 --> 30:52.894
Let me tell you something,
you ain't no boss.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.678
And on the real,
you ain't gonna be nothing

30:54.722 --> 30:56.767
till you get your house
in order.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.859
And you best not put
that stuff in your face.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.427
You don't need it.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.783
- When you're in my house,
you mind your business.

31:12.827 --> 31:16.091
You're sharing your space
with gang bangers, murderers,

31:16.135 --> 31:19.268
people you don't want to mess
with, let alone sleep next to.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.401
- So they just put everyone
in all together?

31:21.444 --> 31:24.273
There's not like a separate
white collar cell?

31:24.317 --> 31:25.840
- One big melting pot.

31:28.495 --> 31:29.800
- You okay, Mom?

31:29.844 --> 31:32.064
- Yeah, you know,
it's just hot in here.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.456
- You got chow at 7:00,

31:33.500 --> 31:35.502
clean up at 7:30,
and then, you gotta shower.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.112
- And what does she shower in?

31:37.156 --> 31:38.635
- A group.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.594
You make a circle, then
rotate under the shower head.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.249
- No, I meant,
like, shower shoes?

31:43.292 --> 31:45.294
- Your shoes
are your shower shoes.

31:45.338 --> 31:46.643
You don't want to get them wet?

31:46.687 --> 31:48.210
You take your chances
with the fungi,

31:48.254 --> 31:49.777
and don't expect
hot water neither.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.432
- And what if she has to,
um, use the--

31:52.475 --> 31:54.216
- There's your bathroom,

31:54.260 --> 31:58.003
your kitchen, your sink,

31:58.046 --> 31:59.308
everything.

31:59.352 --> 32:03.095
- Wait, so people just go
right there?

32:03.138 --> 32:06.098
Like, in front of everybody?

32:06.141 --> 32:07.099
Even number--

32:07.142 --> 32:08.578
- All the numbers.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.494
And most of the time,
there won't be toilet paper.

32:11.538 --> 32:15.498
- Okay. Thank you, Denise,
but I think--

32:15.542 --> 32:17.326
I think she gets it.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.024
- There are things you can do
for a square,

32:19.067 --> 32:20.460
but you don't want to.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.157
- Yeah, well,
we really need to get home.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.332
- You're home with me, ladies!

32:23.376 --> 32:24.943
[laughs]

32:24.986 --> 32:26.335
Welcome home!

32:26.379 --> 32:27.467
- Okay, we gotta get
out of here.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.557
- No can do!
It's not rec time.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.386
- Oh my God,
let me out of here!

32:41.176 --> 32:43.962
- Hey, how was your day?

32:44.005 --> 32:47.139
- Has our credit rebounded
enough to qualify for a loan?

32:47.182 --> 32:50.316
- Well, we put a dent in our
debt, that's for sure.

32:50.359 --> 32:52.013
- Yes or no?
- No.

32:53.754 --> 32:56.235
Look, I know you don't want
to tell me what's going on.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.150
- I need cash fast.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.281
- How much?

32:59.325 --> 33:01.109
- 10 grand.

33:01.153 --> 33:03.024
- Does that have anything to do
with the many vials

33:03.068 --> 33:05.679
of liquid hashish I just saw
in the garage?

33:07.594 --> 33:09.422
- It's not liquid hashish.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.163
- Oh, well...

33:11.206 --> 33:12.816
[clears throat]

33:12.860 --> 33:14.470
What is it then?

33:16.559 --> 33:19.388
Why don't you let me help you?

33:19.432 --> 33:20.868
- I don't know that you can.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.392
- Maybe not, but what
do you got to lose?

33:25.090 --> 33:26.700
[suspenseful music]

33:26.743 --> 33:30.008
- Mr. Boland, I don't have you
down for an appointment today.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.619
- Hey, got a minute?

33:32.662 --> 33:34.577
- I'm with a patient.

33:34.621 --> 33:37.754
- It's slow-growing.
You'll be fine.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.105
How's that Buick treating you?

33:40.148 --> 33:41.584
- Fine.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.806
- You know any dermatologists?

33:45.849 --> 33:48.200
- I can't believe
it was all three!

33:48.243 --> 33:51.899
You know, like, I would get it
if it was just one, you know?

33:51.942 --> 33:53.466
But...

33:53.509 --> 33:56.730
Oh, God...

33:56.773 --> 33:58.558
- Hey.

33:58.601 --> 34:00.516
Want some more water?

34:04.216 --> 34:05.739
- I'm just...

34:07.088 --> 34:10.396
What are we gonna do?

34:10.439 --> 34:12.615
I mean, 'cause I just...

34:14.226 --> 34:16.576
Oh, no, um...

34:16.619 --> 34:18.447
Of course. Yeah.

34:18.491 --> 34:21.276
Sure. Um...

34:21.320 --> 34:23.931
Thank you for letting me know.

34:23.974 --> 34:25.585
Yeah, you too.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.021
Okay, bye.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.505
- Sorry, I was just gonna--

34:36.161 --> 34:37.205
You okay?

34:37.249 --> 34:38.989
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:45.213 --> 34:49.174
- I mean, your insurance
is gonna cover it, right?

34:49.217 --> 34:50.697
- What are you talking about?

34:50.740 --> 34:53.134
- Sadie told me you got robbed.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.483
- [scoffs]

34:54.527 --> 34:57.486
That's like the least of it.

34:57.530 --> 35:00.707
Do I look like a total raccoon
right now?

35:01.795 --> 35:03.188
- No.

35:03.231 --> 35:05.364
You look great.

35:05.407 --> 35:07.714
- Oh my God, it's like--

35:07.757 --> 35:10.151
Ugh, it's these hormones.

35:10.195 --> 35:13.981
I'm, like, shooting up
like a junkie.

35:14.024 --> 35:17.202
And for nothing,
because apparently,

35:17.245 --> 35:19.726
I only make these, like,

35:19.769 --> 35:21.902
crappy unicorn embryos

35:21.945 --> 35:24.687
with, like, horns or something.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.733
- How long have
you been trying?

35:26.776 --> 35:28.735
- This is, like,
our fourth round,

35:28.778 --> 35:32.173
or like, fifth, I honestly--
I can't even keep track

35:32.217 --> 35:34.828
it's been so...

35:34.871 --> 35:38.353
And I literally cannot
stop crying.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.312
I can't.

35:40.355 --> 35:43.184
Stop! Stop! Stop!

35:43.228 --> 35:46.187
[somber music]

35:52.193 --> 35:52.411
.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.630
- You're blocking me in!

35:54.674 --> 35:57.242
- You're leaving? Why did you
tell me to get extra anchovies?

35:57.285 --> 35:58.721
- God. You're a dick.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.114
- What?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.681
- Just move your car,
all right?

36:01.724 --> 36:03.465
- Whoa, what the hell's wrong
with you?

36:03.509 --> 36:05.902
- How long have you
been doing IVF?

36:05.946 --> 36:09.428
- Oh, God.
- Yeah!

36:09.471 --> 36:10.864
- I was gonna tell you.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.474
- When? Mid-bone?

36:12.518 --> 36:13.780
- Oh, gross.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.999
- You were having sex with me

36:16.043 --> 36:18.872
while your wife was injecting
herself full of baby hormones!

36:18.915 --> 36:20.917
- I didn't plan on it,
obviously,

36:20.961 --> 36:22.528
it just, kind of--

36:22.571 --> 36:23.746
happened, you were there!

36:23.790 --> 36:26.140
- No, a solar eclipse
just happens!

36:26.184 --> 36:28.664
Two people decide to sleep
with each other!

36:28.708 --> 36:29.970
- What am I supposed to do?

36:30.013 --> 36:31.624
Leave her and marry you?
We tried that,

36:31.667 --> 36:33.016
it didn't work, remember?

36:37.195 --> 36:39.240
What do you want me to do,
Annie?

36:42.417 --> 36:44.289
- I want you to move your car.

36:48.336 --> 36:49.903
[sighs]

36:49.946 --> 36:51.818
- Door's open! Come in!

36:52.688 --> 36:54.516
Okay, guys, ten more minutes,
okay?

36:54.560 --> 36:56.692
And then, it's homework time.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.173
[baby fussing]

36:59.217 --> 37:00.914
Hey.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.831
Is it all there this time?

37:04.874 --> 37:06.789
- It's all there.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.574
- Can you hand--

37:08.617 --> 37:10.010
Thanks.

37:13.622 --> 37:16.756
I'm not an evil person, okay?

37:16.799 --> 37:18.366
- Okay.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.283
- It's just, um,

37:22.327 --> 37:24.677
Jeff left me with, like,

37:24.720 --> 37:26.505
a mountain of debt, so...

37:26.548 --> 37:29.247
I have literally nothing
to lose.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.730
- Now you do.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.341
[baby cries]

37:36.384 --> 37:38.256
If we get caught,
you're going down, too.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.345
I think it's called
an accessory.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.434
- So why are you doing it?

37:42.477 --> 37:45.306
- Same reason.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.916
- You sure about that?

37:49.005 --> 37:50.398
- Have you ever heard the
theory

37:50.442 --> 37:52.705
that they always look
like daddy when they're born?

37:52.748 --> 37:55.360
Some caveman evolution thing,

37:55.403 --> 37:57.449
so men know it's theirs,
and they don't leave.

37:57.492 --> 38:01.061
- Well, this one's Jeff's twin,
so...

38:01.104 --> 38:04.760
- All four of mine looked
