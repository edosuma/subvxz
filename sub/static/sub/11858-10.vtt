WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.750
"Our lives begin to end

00:05.834 --> 00:09.250
"the day we become silent
about things that matter."

00:09.333 --> 00:10.917
'These words of
Martin Luther King Jr.'

00:11.000 --> 00:15.333
'hold special import today,
as our own lives begin'

00:15.417 --> 00:18.417
'as we go forth,
past these ivory towers'

00:18.500 --> 00:25.125
into a city and a world rife
with poverty, with war

00:25.208 --> 00:27.583
and with injustice.

00:27.667 --> 00:30.250
'Be brave, be fearless..'

00:32.458 --> 00:35.417
...and most importantly,
be compassionate.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.959
Congratulations,
Class of 1982..

00:39.041 --> 00:41.125
...we are officially graduated.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.917
Ms. Rush, Lilly,
Ms. Rush, Ms. Rush..

01:41.333 --> 01:43.000
Lilly, Lilly.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.250
We're losing her.

02:06.542 --> 02:08.667
Hey. Another late night?

02:10.125 --> 02:12.250
Too many margaritas.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.709
Gin kills me.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.875
Gin?
You mean
tequila.

02:17.709 --> 02:19.834
I don't make 'em,
I just drink 'em.

02:19.917 --> 02:21.375
Trouble sleeping, huh?

02:21.458 --> 02:23.375
No, not at all.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.500
Hey, you're here early.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.542
Anything to get out of PPD.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.000
Jeffries biting
everyone's head off?

02:30.083 --> 02:33.208
I won't even step foot
into Stillman's office.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.709
- When's the boss back?
- Two more weeks.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.709
- Counting the days.
- And minutes.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.208
So what's up?

02:39.291 --> 02:41.959
Kid buried here,
a Mike Delaney.

02:42.041 --> 02:43.750
College type,
shot back in
'82.

02:43.834 --> 02:45.625
Someone vandalized his grave.

02:45.709 --> 02:48.375
The 25th anniversary
of his death coming up.

02:48.458 --> 02:51.250
University's doing some kinda
memorial service for him?

02:51.333 --> 02:53.166
Big man on campus,
back in the day.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.041
College police, homicide,
both
turned the place inside
out.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.375
Got nothing.
No suspects, no
motives.

02:58.458 --> 03:01.917
Hmm. Straight-A student,
Varsity jock..

03:03.208 --> 03:05.458
...president of the local
"Meals On Wheels" chapter.

03:05.542 --> 03:08.917
Making the rest of us look
like lazy-ass
good-for-nothings.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.792
Had a reputation
as a womanizer.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.500
A real Casanova.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.333
Every girl on
campus wanted him

03:15.417 --> 03:17.208
every guy
wanted to be
him.

03:17.291 --> 03:19.000
(Scotty)
'But who'd want to kill
him?'

03:22.417 --> 03:23.667
Maybe her.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.083
(Will)
Original theory,
mugging gone South.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.041
University's in the middle of
one of Philly's poorest hoods.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.750
(Scotty)
Lots of tension between
the students and the locals.

04:05.834 --> 04:09.083
Well, no one heard
the altercation, gunfire.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.917
On graduation night,
everyone's loaded.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.667
Security guard found
Mike's body the next morning..

04:13.750 --> 04:15.125
...middle of the quad.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.166
There was a nine millimeter
recovered three blocks

04:17.250 --> 04:19.125
from the crime scene..

04:19.208 --> 04:21.834
...matched our victim's
ballistics. No prints.

04:21.917 --> 04:24.959
The serial number was filled
off
making it untraceable.

04:25.041 --> 04:27.834
Well, no National
Ballistics Database back
then

04:27.917 --> 04:29.917
might be able to
sniff it out now.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.333
Let's run it.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.959
Sure, Boss.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.709
We're also looking into the
cemetery surveillance footage

04:37.792 --> 04:40.500
from this morning, maybe
our tagger got caught on tape.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.667
The trajectory of
the bullet indicates the doer

04:42.750 --> 04:45.333
was anywhere from
five-two to five-four.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.166
Well, if the doer's
a vigilante rape
victim

04:47.250 --> 04:49.000
height could point to a woman.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.834
Might've found our tagger.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.625
Police report filed back
in '82 at West Detectives.

04:53.709 --> 04:56.750
Alleged rape naming
Michael Delaney as the doer.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.542
- Who's the victim?
- Name's left blank.

04:58.625 --> 05:02.250
The assigned officer
was a Maggie Lafferty.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.375
"Locked and Loaded" Lafferty.

05:04.458 --> 05:05.959
Instructor at
the Academy range.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.417
Was a real ball-buster.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.834
Want us to have a talk?

05:09.917 --> 05:11.875
Do you really need
me
to tell you what to
do?

05:11.959 --> 05:14.291
Just checking...boss.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.875
Don't call me boss.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.542
I'm out of here at 5:00
today,
so no dilly-dallying.

05:27.625 --> 05:30.542
You a 5:00 p.m. man now?
That Toni's doing?

05:30.625 --> 05:32.458
Ah, figured I'd set
a good example for
Andre.

05:32.542 --> 05:33.667
Sit-down family dinners.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.875
[snickering]
'What?

05:35.959 --> 05:37.000
Know what I'm getting
you for Christmas..

05:37.083 --> 05:38.125
...tickets to the ballet.

05:38.208 --> 05:41.792
- Ballet?
- Yep. "The Nutcracker."

05:44.458 --> 05:46.333
- Is that the pit bull?
- Much better.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.417
Maggie Lafferty?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.041
Philly PD.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.792
Would've never guessed,
cheap suit and all.

05:54.458 --> 05:57.458
You worked Sex Crimes at
West in '82, right, Maggie?

05:57.542 --> 05:59.083
On the line
too.
So what?

05:59.166 --> 06:00.583
You handle this job?

06:03.625 --> 06:05.291
I remember the kid, sure.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.291
Said a Michael Delaney
raped her?

06:09.375 --> 06:11.500
Yep.
Nothing I could do.

06:11.583 --> 06:12.875
I thought
you were Sex Crimes.

06:12.959 --> 06:14.417
A joke,
back in the
day.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.750
I had a desk, a
phone,
that's it. Nobody
cared.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.709
Not that you'd remember.
You,
maybe.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.458
So you sent her away. Nice.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.333
My lieutenant said
rape victims were
gals

06:24.417 --> 06:25.959
that just
regretted it
the next morning.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.166
'My hands were tied.'

06:28.250 --> 06:29.834
Real door prize,
your lieutenant.

06:29.917 --> 06:32.792
Men. Can't live with
'em,
can't kill 'em off.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.041
Drop the battle axe.
Talk about the girl.

06:36.834 --> 06:39.000
Name was, uh, Tess..

06:39.083 --> 06:40.834
...Tessie something or other.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.458
Scholarship kid
from Kensington

06:42.542 --> 06:44.291
'working a job in
the school cafeteria'

06:44.375 --> 06:46.125
raising her kid
brother, parents
dead.

06:46.208 --> 06:47.458
How'd she run into Delaney?

06:47.542 --> 06:49.250
Knew the ass-clown from school.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.125
Real charmer, that guy.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.375
Gave her a paper rose
before he tore her up.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.375
So this Tessie comes in..

06:56.458 --> 06:58.083
And boy, was she a wreck.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.709
Don't you think it'd be wise
to leave your kid brother
home?

07:08.834 --> 07:11.500
I told Jimmy I got robbed
that's why we're here.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.667
He's scared
to stay home alone.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.000
So you, uh,
knew your
attacker?

07:17.083 --> 07:19.709
We went out
two nights ago.

07:19.792 --> 07:21.333
So you dated this guy?

07:21.417 --> 07:22.834
We didn't date.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.500
We went out, once.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.291
And, uh,
where'd the rape occur?

07:28.875 --> 07:30.667
In..

07:31.417 --> 07:32.875
...in my apartment.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.500
He dropped me off after dinner

07:36.583 --> 07:38.583
he said he had
to use the bathroom--

07:38.667 --> 07:40.375
Any witnesses
to what
transpired?

07:42.083 --> 07:45.208
My brother was asleep
in the next room.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.917
Maybe I should've
screamed, woke him up

07:49.000 --> 07:50.667
so he could've witnessed it.

07:52.291 --> 07:55.542
Look, you wanna
press charges, I can do
that.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.250
But this is how
it's gonna play
out.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.959
How much did you have to drink?

08:00.041 --> 08:01.458
'What were you wearing?'

08:01.542 --> 08:03.291
- 'Why'd you bring him home?'
- I already told you.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.041
Do you bring guys up
to your place a lot?

08:05.125 --> 08:06.709
Are you sexually promiscuous?

08:08.625 --> 08:10.125
'You get the picture?'

08:10.208 --> 08:11.959
'And after that,
he'll still walk.'

08:13.041 --> 08:14.750
I've seen it time and again.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.792
What if he comes back?

08:16.875 --> 08:18.542
What am I supposed to do?

08:18.625 --> 08:20.917
(Maggie)
'Well, if he breaks in,
you can report it.'

08:22.458 --> 08:25.291
Otherwise, lock your doors.

08:25.375 --> 08:28.542
- Right.
- I'm sorry, I really am.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.166
Just give me a second.

08:44.333 --> 08:48.291
When he was done,
you know what he said?

08:48.375 --> 08:50.208
"You're prettier
when you smile."

08:52.333 --> 08:55.750
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Me too.

09:06.125 --> 09:08.542
Didn't even have a name
for date rape back then.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.625
Rape shield laws are
supposed to protect victims

09:10.709 --> 09:12.083
from being
crucified on the
stand.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.291
Game was different
if you knew your attacker.

09:14.375 --> 09:16.667
No one saw 'em
as real victims.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.250
So Mike rapes this
girl,
gets off scot-free.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.583
- That's justice.
- That was the law.

09:27.417 --> 09:28.709
Tessie Bartram?

09:29.917 --> 09:33.333
- Philly Homicide.
- Homicide?

09:33.417 --> 09:36.083
- Where were you this morning?
- Here. Home.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.542
Getting ready for work. Why?

09:37.625 --> 09:40.875
- Got anyone to verify that?
- No. I live alone.

09:40.959 --> 09:42.125
What is this about?

09:42.208 --> 09:45.667
Does the name
Mike Delaney ring any bells?

09:45.750 --> 09:47.500
Of course.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.792
He went to my school.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.291
The grave was
vandalized this morning.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.291
- Know anything about that?
- Absolutely not.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.667
Well, we know
what he did to you.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.333
Look, I'm late
for an
appointment.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.041
No one believed you

09:59.125 --> 10:01.834
so you pretended
it never happened.

10:01.917 --> 10:04.291
But it did.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.709
I don't know what
you're talking
about.

10:05.792 --> 10:07.792
I think you do.

10:10.709 --> 10:13.083
- What do you want from me?
- The truth.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.250
25 years later,
you're kinda late to the
party.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.458
Understandable,
you wanting revenge.

10:17.542 --> 10:20.750
So, in other words,
did I kill that
bastard?

10:20.834 --> 10:22.166
Did you?

10:22.250 --> 10:26.208
Graduation day I was home
with my brother, so, no.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.125
You didn't go to
your own graduation?

10:28.208 --> 10:30.834
I dropped out
after it happened

10:30.917 --> 10:33.709
and I never set foot
on that damn campus again.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.250
You grew up in Kensington.

10:35.333 --> 10:38.792
Must've felt lucky
to be at that school.

10:38.875 --> 10:43.125
I felt even luckier when
The Mike Delaney

11:12.250 --> 11:13.125
Hey!

11:14.500 --> 11:16.458
Hi.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.917
Here's the deal..

11:18.000 --> 11:19.208
...I'm just gonna say it

11:19.291 --> 11:21.959
so don't think
I'm a dope or
whatever.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.709
Okay.

11:23.792 --> 11:26.583
Every night,
I see you sitting
here

11:26.667 --> 11:28.375
not messing around
like the rest of us

11:28.458 --> 11:31.166
or killing time
till the bar is
open

11:31.250 --> 11:34.834
'and I'm thinkin'
this girl's different.'

11:34.917 --> 11:37.166
- Special.
- Yeah, right.

11:38.959 --> 11:42.375
Just hear me out, okay? Because
every night..

11:42.458 --> 11:44.917
...I'm like "Go over
there
right now

11:45.000 --> 11:46.583
"say the perfect thing."

11:46.667 --> 11:50.458
But I know whatever it
is,
she'll just think it's
some..

11:50.542 --> 11:52.166
...dumb pick-up in a library.

11:53.375 --> 11:54.709
Not yet, I don't.

11:54.792 --> 11:57.041
You think
I should give it a
shot?

11:57.125 --> 12:00.333
- Go for it.
- I'm gonna do it then.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.750
Okay? You ready?
Here it comes.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.875
Would you have
dinner with me?

12:14.208 --> 12:17.417
I bought his crap,
hook, line and
sinker.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.959
You were young, he was good.

12:20.041 --> 12:23.625
I had nightmares about
it
for months afterward.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.417
I would wake up terrified

12:26.500 --> 12:28.875
thinking he was in my room.

12:28.959 --> 12:30.458
Thought I was going crazy.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.709
Oh, must have been awful.

12:33.792 --> 12:36.041
'And that's why
you dropped out?'

12:36.125 --> 12:39.375
I got a job and I put
my brother through
college.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.125
At least
one of us
graduated.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.250
- If that's it, can I go?
- Yeah.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.500
If you find who killed him..

12:52.625 --> 12:54.208
...give 'em a medal.

12:57.417 --> 13:00.542
Guys like Delaney make it
hell for the rest of us.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.125
Your point?

13:02.208 --> 13:05.917
My point is, sometimes women
say no when they don't mean it

13:06.000 --> 13:09.250
'cause if they didn't,
they'd be thought of, you
know..

13:09.333 --> 13:12.166
- Hos?
- Digging that ditch deeper.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.959
I would never
call a woman a
ho.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.792
All I'm saying is
what's a guy to do

13:16.875 --> 13:18.625
back off at the first no?

13:18.709 --> 13:20.083
Human race would go extinct.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.709
(Kat)
'No means no.'

13:21.792 --> 13:23.875
How many ways you need
that spelled out?

13:23.959 --> 13:25.750
The name of the game
is pursuit.

13:25.834 --> 13:27.875
You run, I chase.

13:27.959 --> 13:29.542
You ain't chasing me anywhere.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.750
We follow up
on Tess' alibi or what?

13:31.834 --> 13:34.583
I checked out. Doesn't
mean
the brother isn't lying.

13:34.667 --> 13:35.667
'Cause no means yes.

13:35.750 --> 13:38.083
Enough...both of you.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.417
I think I found something

13:40.500 --> 13:41.834
Mike's yearbook.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.625
Mike gave Tessie a rose
when they met, we know that.

13:48.709 --> 13:51.250
(Lilly)
'There are
more roses, more girls.'

13:51.333 --> 13:52.291
There must be
ten women there.

13:52.375 --> 13:53.625
'They could be other victims'

13:53.709 --> 13:56.625
or maybe women
he was zeroing in on.

13:56.709 --> 13:59.125
Saying we got a serial rapist?

13:59.208 --> 14:01.583
Saying we got
a new pool of
targets.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.750
And any one of them
could have killed him.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.583
(Will)
'Are these the other
women from Mike's yearbook?'

14:10.667 --> 14:12.542
Yeah. Picked 'em all
up at the library.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.625
Same BS with the paper roses.

14:14.709 --> 14:17.333
One of the girls we couldn't
bring in, Shaina McNulty.

14:17.417 --> 14:18.792
(Will)
'She lawyer up?'

14:18.875 --> 14:20.250
(Nick)
'Nah, she put
a bullet in her head'

14:20.333 --> 14:22.917
a few months before Mike
was killed. She was 18.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.458
Rush and Miller
are doing the interviews.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.709
Figured female cops
should talk to them.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.125
Meanwhile, us jerk male cops

14:28.208 --> 14:30.750
got the security footage
from the cemetery.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.125
Only visitor
yesterday morning

14:32.208 --> 14:33.792
only one who could have
vandalized Mike's grave.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.083
(Scotty)
'Can't make heads or tails.'

14:35.166 --> 14:36.750
I'll show it
to the
groundskeeper.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.583
The girls' yearbook photos
too.
Might jog his memory.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.041
So why do we even
care about this job?

14:42.125 --> 14:43.417
The guy got
what was coming to him

14:43.500 --> 14:45.709
'in my book,
community service murder.'

14:45.792 --> 14:48.291
Damn right.

14:48.375 --> 14:51.125
'Cause we're murder cops. Go do
your jobs.

15:01.458 --> 15:04.875
Mike didn't rape
me.
That's ridiculous.

15:04.959 --> 15:06.917
No, you dated him, though.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.458
Once. We had nothing in common.
We went our separate ways.

15:10.542 --> 15:11.458
'End of story.'

15:11.542 --> 15:13.917
Did you have sex with him?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.625
That's really none
of your business.

15:16.709 --> 15:18.083
Did you say no?

15:19.542 --> 15:22.583
Well, that's what you're
supposed to say, right?

15:22.667 --> 15:23.917
It can't be too easy.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.583
Is that what you think

15:26.667 --> 15:28.041
you were easy?

15:29.208 --> 15:30.667
I'd had too much to drink.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.458
So it's your fault
what he did?

15:33.542 --> 15:35.458
Maybe it was.
Maybe I shouldn't have

15:35.542 --> 15:37.041
brought him up to my room.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.750
- I think I had too much
wine.
- Me too.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.458
Um, I'm still a virgin, Mike.

15:50.542 --> 15:51.458
Me too.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.875
Seriously, I,
I don't want
to.

15:54.875 --> 15:56.083
Why did you
bring me up here, huh?

15:56.166 --> 15:57.125
What are you doing?

15:57.208 --> 15:58.834
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

16:01.166 --> 16:03.834
No. Please don't! No!

16:07.208 --> 16:10.041
I was sending
mixed signals, I
guess.

16:10.125 --> 16:13.208
No, you were pretty damn clear.

16:13.291 --> 16:14.875
What does it matter now?

16:17.041 --> 16:19.250
Did you kill him, Melinda?

16:19.333 --> 16:21.542
I wasn't raped, okay?

16:22.625 --> 16:24.583
I wasn't some victim.

16:30.291 --> 16:34.208
In college,
I was on top of the world.

16:34.291 --> 16:37.917
Head of my sorority,
dating 24/7

16:38.000 --> 16:40.458
big-time party girl.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.458
And then you met Mike.

16:42.542 --> 16:46.417
After two dates, I was
planning our wedding in my
head.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.917
'Pathetic, huh?'

16:49.000 --> 16:50.250
You liked him.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.583
He said I was
different, special.

16:54.166 --> 16:55.291
Right?

16:55.375 --> 16:58.750
You ever tell
anyone what he did?

17:00.208 --> 17:03.333
The morning after it happened,
I tried to tell my best friend.

17:06.583 --> 17:09.083
Oh, my God.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.667
You guys totally did it.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.333
(Karin)
'I don't wanna talk about
it.'

17:17.709 --> 17:19.208
(Lisa)
'Tore this off you.'

17:19.291 --> 17:22.291
- Mike's a total animal.
- Give it back, Lisa. Come
on!

17:24.083 --> 17:25.750
(Lisa)
'What's wrong, Kar?'

17:32.875 --> 17:35.709
- He raped me.
- What?

17:35.792 --> 17:37.959
We were kissin' and then..

17:39.667 --> 17:40.959
...he changed.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.333
Come on, Kar.

17:44.417 --> 17:47.291
A guy like Mike
doesn't need to rape anyone.

17:47.375 --> 17:50.542
I mean, you wanted to do it
with him, right?

17:53.208 --> 17:56.041
Yeah. Right.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.166
Let's just hope he calls.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.083
I just always
wondered why he did it.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.041
I liked him, you know?

18:10.125 --> 18:12.000
He didn't have to force me.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.542
Where were you
the night he was
shot?

18:16.625 --> 18:17.959
Oh, please

18:19.417 --> 18:21.041
I didn't kill him.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.875
I didn't even press charges.

18:22.959 --> 18:26.083
- Why not?
- I was the party girl,
okay?

18:26.166 --> 18:28.166
I knew what
everybody would say.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.834
I didn't wanna be
raped all over again.

18:30.917 --> 18:33.917
A lot of anger keeping
your secret bottled up.

18:35.959 --> 18:38.500
Anger?

18:38.583 --> 18:40.125
You wouldn't know
the half of it.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.834
A guy like Mike
deserved what he got.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.583
Damn right he did.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.458
- Maybe you got even.
- I wanted to, believe me.

18:49.792 --> 18:52.542
Saw him
on campus everywhere..

18:52.625 --> 18:54.333
...weeks after.

18:55.542 --> 18:57.667
Always with that damn smile.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.709
Hey, pretty lady.

19:15.792 --> 19:17.375
Screw you.
Get away from me.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.875
I know.
You're mad I haven't
called.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.208
[scoffs]
You son of a bitch.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.959
You know damn well
what happened! I said no!

19:26.041 --> 19:29.625
But you didn't
mean it...did
you?

19:35.083 --> 19:36.208
Hey!

19:37.500 --> 19:42.041
I told the dean and he
promised
to look into it.

19:42.125 --> 19:45.458
Next thing you know, Mike's
giving a valedictorian speech.

19:45.542 --> 19:46.959
Hmm.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.417
And you knew
that he'd never
pay.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.041
It's the 25th
anniversary of his
death.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.750
Boo-hoo.

19:54.834 --> 19:58.333
You were the one who
wrote "Rapist" on his grave

19:58.417 --> 19:59.875
weren't you, Regie?

20:03.750 --> 20:06.583
I got pregnant after..

20:09.417 --> 20:11.291
...I took care
of it
on my own.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.250
Never told a soul.

20:18.375 --> 20:21.542
So, yeah, I did.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.583
Fine me.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.291
The world had to know
what he did to you..

20:28.375 --> 20:29.959
...to the others.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.458
Others?

20:35.458 --> 20:37.166
How many were there?

20:38.291 --> 20:39.959
Did you kill him, Regie?

20:40.041 --> 20:44.083
No, but I'm glad
somebody stopped him..

20:46.083 --> 20:48.125
...since you people never did.

20:54.417 --> 20:57.291
- Can I come in?
- What the hell you want?

20:57.375 --> 20:59.417
The rape victim who
offed herself, Shaina McNulty?

20:59.500 --> 21:01.542
Found something.
Turns out she used her dad's

21:01.625 --> 21:02.709
nine-mill to do the deed.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.875
Same make and model
that killed Mike.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.333
So maybe dad found out
about the rape?

21:07.417 --> 21:09.291
Figured that's why
his
little girl killed
herself.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.959
- Went looking for justice.
- Dirty Harry style.

21:13.041 --> 21:15.250
You owned a nine
millimeter, Smith and Wesson

21:15.333 --> 21:17.166
back in '82, Mr. McNulty.

21:17.250 --> 21:19.583
Same kinda gun that
killed Mike Delaney.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.000
And my little girl.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.792
Can't blame you
for offing that bastard.

21:23.875 --> 21:24.875
I would have too.

21:24.959 --> 21:28.333
No way
he's getting away with it.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.917
I didn't believe her.

21:31.125 --> 21:33.709
Shaina told you
what happened with Mike?

21:35.208 --> 21:36.709
And I told her
that nice girls

21:36.792 --> 21:39.500
don't bring boys
up to their rooms. That's..

21:41.291 --> 21:43.375
...what I said.

21:43.458 --> 21:46.333
(Nick)
'Hard knowing
the right thing to say.'

21:46.417 --> 21:48.583
Shaina shut down
right before my
eyes.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.709
Stopped eating,
holed up in
that..

21:50.792 --> 21:52.333
...damn dorm room.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.875
I thought it was a..

21:56.709 --> 21:59.959
...a phase and she'd
grow out of it.

22:02.959 --> 22:04.542
Then I got the call.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.125
(Jason)
'Where is Shaina?'

22:10.417 --> 22:11.542
Shaina!

22:11.625 --> 22:15.083
Mr. McNulty, sir,
you can't go in
there.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.834
Where is she?

22:21.166 --> 22:23.166
'Why didn't anyone
try and stop her?'

22:24.792 --> 22:26.917
Why didn't you help
my little girl?

22:28.417 --> 22:29.709
I'm sorry.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.291
I'm so sorry.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.458
If I had just believed her..

22:45.792 --> 22:47.792
...maybe Shaina
would still be here.

22:49.041 --> 22:52.000
Uh, Mr. McNulty, you sure
you saw that female cop

22:52.083 --> 22:53.417
in her dorm room?

22:55.000 --> 22:59.208
I never forgot her face.
Like she'd seen a ghost.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.291
She had a book,
one of Shaina's.

23:01.375 --> 23:02.959
Yeah, her diary.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.500
Can we take a look at it?

23:04.583 --> 23:06.750
I think they kept it,
the cops.

23:08.583 --> 23:10.583
Had to pack up her..

23:10.667 --> 23:12.250
...room and her stuff.

23:17.834 --> 23:19.959
They didn't even
clean up the
blood.

23:23.041 --> 23:25.458
We'll give you
a minute, Mr. McNulty.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.959
Didn't stop Mike
when she had the chance.

23:31.041 --> 23:32.917
So maybe she takes
the law into her own hands.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.875
Don't call her "Locked 'n
Loaded" Lafferty for
nothing.

23:45.750 --> 23:49.000
The ballistics came back on
the
gun that killed Mike Delaney.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.875
Turns out it matched
a nine mil used

23:50.959 --> 23:53.291
in an '81
North Philly robbery.

23:53.375 --> 23:55.375
Same year you were
working evidence.

23:55.458 --> 23:57.417
Gun disappeared
shortly after.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.875
You gotta be kidding.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.208
Yeah.
We're a barrel of laughs
here.

24:01.291 --> 24:03.709
Save the smartass
remarks for the civilians.

24:03.792 --> 24:05.667
'Cause you're a
cop.
Right side of the
law.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.458
You wanna take me in,
girlfriend, go for it.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.083
I'm calling
my FOP lawyer.

24:09.166 --> 24:11.583
So you found
Shaina McNulty's diary.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.291
(Kat)
'Realized Mike raped her
too.'

24:14.375 --> 24:16.583
Your fault,
that kid eating her gun

24:16.667 --> 24:18.333
you could have
stopped him.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.917
I went to the DA, right?

24:22.000 --> 24:26.375
Told him I had two vics and
a serial rapist on my hands.

24:26.458 --> 24:30.208
He said I had no witnesses,
no evidence, no case.

24:30.291 --> 24:33.208
So you took care of business.
Your own way.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.875
Our job is to
protect the victims.

24:37.417 --> 24:39.000
Sometimes you gotta
bend the rules.

24:39.083 --> 24:40.709
(Lilly)
'More than bend the rules.'

24:40.792 --> 24:42.375
You went off
the reservation,
Lafferty.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.792
Damn right I did.
Nothing was gonna stop

24:44.875 --> 24:47.375
that guy except
a Smith and Wesson.

24:47.458 --> 24:49.375
So you tracked him
down.
Took him out.

24:50.458 --> 24:54.208
No. But I did
what I had to do.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.834
So I was thinkin'' we'd treat
ourselves to a flick tonight.

24:56.917 --> 24:57.959
We got movie money, Tessie?

24:58.041 --> 25:00.959
Hey, don't worry
about it, okay?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.625
You're 12, geez

25:02.709 --> 25:05.208
think about girls
or something.

25:05.291 --> 25:07.250
(Maggie)
Tessie?

25:07.333 --> 25:08.959
That, uh, robbery..

25:09.041 --> 25:10.792
...think we might
have found your wallet.

25:10.875 --> 25:13.000
Put the ice cream away,
Jimmy, before it melts.

25:13.083 --> 25:16.250
- I'll wait for you, Tess.
- Go up, already.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.291
I'll be there
in a minute, okay?

25:28.208 --> 25:30.667
I've been, uh,
thinking about what you
said.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.000
Him coming back.

25:33.166 --> 25:35.250
Got the right to
defend yourself.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.083
Yeah, I remember.
Lock my doors.

25:38.166 --> 25:40.583
Other ways to do it.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.166
You know what I mean?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.625
He comes at you,
it's called imminent
danger.

25:46.709 --> 25:48.291
The DA'll never charge you.

25:49.375 --> 25:51.375
You're telling me..

25:51.458 --> 25:52.875
...to kill him.

25:52.959 --> 25:57.166
That would be, uh,
unethical of me as a
cop.

25:57.250 --> 26:00.291
I'm just informin' you
of your rights is all.

26:04.542 --> 26:06.458
Mail's piling up.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.458
Might wanna check your box.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.792
You gave her the gun
that killed Mike
Delaney.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.291
Get off the high
and mighty, will you?

26:27.375 --> 26:30.792
System wasn't gonna protect
victims like her, I had to.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.625
By telling her
how to commit a felony.

26:34.041 --> 26:37.500
'82 was a long,
long time ago.

26:38.375 --> 26:39.750
My memory's kind of fuzzy.

26:39.834 --> 26:42.792
Well, we'll subpoena
you.
Put you on the stand.

26:42.875 --> 26:45.333
You try to take
that kid down..

26:45.417 --> 26:46.542
...you'll get
nothing from me.

26:46.625 --> 26:48.000
Sayin' you're
gonna
lie in court?

26:48.083 --> 26:49.542
Sayin' I don't remember squat

26:49.625 --> 26:51.625
so don't hold
your breath, goldilocks.

26:59.542 --> 27:02.166
You wanna question Tessie,
I need to be present.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.875
- And you are?
- My brother. Also my lawyer.

27:07.291 --> 27:08.792
Fine. Have a seat.

27:10.333 --> 27:14.625
'We know Sergeant Lafferty
gave your client a gun.'

27:14.709 --> 27:16.875
Same one that was used in
the murder of Mike
Delaney.

27:16.959 --> 27:20.000
And this witness is
willing to testify to that?

27:21.625 --> 27:24.041
- I didn't think so.
- I know what it's like.

27:24.125 --> 27:25.291
The nightmares.

27:25.375 --> 27:29.125
Making you relive
what happened over and
over.

27:31.041 --> 27:32.458
Is that a question
or a monologue?

27:32.542 --> 27:35.375
And until you tell
someone
what really happened..

27:35.458 --> 27:37.333
...the nightmares won't stop.

27:37.417 --> 27:39.834
Believe me, Tessie.
I know.

27:45.333 --> 27:48.792
He used me like a..

27:49.834 --> 27:50.834
...toilet..

27:50.917 --> 27:52.750
You don't have
to talk to her.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.834
And every time
he'd smile at
me..

27:58.250 --> 28:01.208
...I was right
back
on that kitchen
floor

28:01.291 --> 28:02.917
and..

28:03.000 --> 28:04.709
...ugh, his smell..

28:04.792 --> 28:06.291
- My client's done talking.
- No, no, we're not done here.

28:06.375 --> 28:07.583
Oh yeah, we are.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.542
Yeah, you killed
him,
didn't you, Tessie?

28:09.625 --> 28:11.250
- Oh, I wanted to.
- Tessie, shut up.

28:11.333 --> 28:14.625
Nightmares won't stop,
till you tell me what you
did.

28:14.709 --> 28:16.125
No, tell me.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.667
We're done here.

28:38.792 --> 28:40.792
Justifiable homicide,
you ask me.

28:40.875 --> 28:43.291
I hear that.
Loud and clear.

28:43.375 --> 28:46.166
(Will)
Moot point.
Struck out on this one.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.500
Nice try, Lil.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.291
(Nick)
'Yeah. Way to go, Lil.'

28:49.375 --> 28:50.583
It's not our jobs to decide

28:50.667 --> 28:52.709
which murders
we like or don't
like.

28:52.792 --> 28:54.959
Nah, our job is
to put away some kid

28:55.041 --> 28:56.709
for doing the right thing.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.750
So we let every
vigilante walk?

28:58.834 --> 29:02.375
- That what you're sayin'?
- Sayin' maybe let this one.

29:03.792 --> 29:05.667
Well, I need
to talk to her
again.

29:05.750 --> 29:08.083
Not gonna happen.
She's lawyered up.

29:08.166 --> 29:10.542
What is it with
you and this case?

29:10.625 --> 29:12.083
Why do you even care
about that scumbag?

29:12.166 --> 29:14.959
- It's not about him.
- Then what?

29:15.041 --> 29:17.291
'Cause I can't figure out
why you're wasting our time.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.291
There's got to be a way
to talk to her, right,
boss?

29:25.625 --> 29:28.417
Go home, Lil.
All of you. Please.

29:37.625 --> 29:39.417
Quite a spread
you got here, John.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.750
Hey.

29:40.834 --> 29:42.375
- Wasn't expecting you.
- Hey.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.709
So how's it going
back at the ranch?

29:45.792 --> 29:47.834
Say we take her
out,
hit the high seas

29:47.917 --> 29:49.166
come back next year.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.166
That bad, huh?

29:52.250 --> 29:55.208
Well, chasing our
tails on this one.

29:55.291 --> 29:58.083
Doer's gonna walk.
Rush won't let it
go.

29:58.166 --> 29:59.792
Well, she's got
good instincts, Will.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.208
Let her follow 'em.

30:04.041 --> 30:06.709
Sometimes being the boss
means staying out of their
way.

30:06.792 --> 30:10.834
I'm done playing
peacemaker.
I'm not cut out for it.

30:10.917 --> 30:12.458
We need you back, John.

30:13.959 --> 30:16.625
I got 31 years
on the job, Will.

30:16.709 --> 30:18.417
Maybe it's time
to have a life.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.834
Ah, sunstroke talking there.

30:22.709 --> 30:25.208
I think I've lost
my taste for it.

30:25.291 --> 30:28.208
The politics or the job?

30:28.291 --> 30:29.750
Is there a difference?

30:34.709 --> 30:36.834
Doing some reading?

30:36.917 --> 30:38.583
Shaina's diary.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.500
A few months before
she killed herself..

30:41.834 --> 30:43.834
...this entry..

30:43.917 --> 30:46.417
"...I know I'm not
alone in my pain.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.083
"There are others
who wrote on The Wall.

30:49.166 --> 30:51.333
"He won't get away
with what he did."

30:51.417 --> 30:53.542
Shaina knew about
the other girls?

30:53.625 --> 30:55.083
Oh, sounds like it.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.375
So what's this "wall"
they wrote on?

30:59.458 --> 31:02.917
Place on campus where
they could leave
messages.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.959
Well, we know he picked up
his victims at the library.

31:06.041 --> 31:07.583
Maybe there?

31:07.667 --> 31:10.750
Well, no internet
chat rooms back in
'82.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.834
- Hmm.
- A bulletin board maybe?

31:12.917 --> 31:16.208
Some place girls could
communicate privately.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.417
Like a bathroom stall?

31:19.500 --> 31:22.959
Old school chat room.
For men and women both.

31:23.041 --> 31:25.041
Worth following up?

31:25.125 --> 31:26.375
Do it.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.750
You coming, Will?

31:31.458 --> 31:32.917
Glad you asked.

31:38.458 --> 31:41.125
I always wondered
what you ladies had in here.

31:43.041 --> 31:45.083
Everything you got.

31:45.166 --> 31:47.417
(Will)
'Not quite.'

31:47.500 --> 31:50.333
Think they'd clean up
this stuff time to time.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.625
Got it.

32:11.375 --> 32:13.834
(Will)
'"MD." Michael Delaney.'

32:13.917 --> 32:16.750
"I told my dad and
he said it was my fault."

32:16.834 --> 32:20.333
- Shaina.
- There's more.

32:20.417 --> 32:21.834
Other girls.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.542
"I told the Dean.."

32:25.625 --> 32:28.083
<i>(Regie)</i>
<i>...dean and nothing happened.</i>

32:29.792 --> 32:31.458
"I told the cops.."

32:31.542 --> 32:34.834
<i>(Tessie)</i>
<i>I told the cops</i>
<i>and nothing happened.</i>

32:34.917 --> 32:36.542
<i>(Karin)</i>
<i>He raped me too.</i>

32:36.625 --> 32:40.000
<i>I told my roommate</i>
<i>and she said I asked for</i>
<i>it.</i>

32:40.083 --> 32:43.041
- Karin wrote that.
- Mm-hmm.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.041
"He raped me too and
I never told anyone.."

32:45.125 --> 32:47.834
<i>(Melinda)</i>
<i>He raped me too and</i>
<i>I never told anyone</i>

32:47.917 --> 32:49.583
<i>'cause it was my fault.</i>

32:53.625 --> 32:55.208
They lied.

32:55.291 --> 32:57.208
They knew about each other.

32:57.291 --> 32:58.917
And they made a plan..

33:02.667 --> 33:04.250
...to kill him.

33:10.625 --> 33:13.041
Got Karin
and Melinda here too.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.375
One of them's gonna break.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.417
You wanna make a deal,
now's the time.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.667
I didn't kill
Mike Delaney.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.709
You did it together.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.083
- With Tessie too. We know
that.
- That is ridiculous.

33:25.166 --> 33:28.959
Writing on the wall
says different,
Regie.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.250
Remember now?

33:30.333 --> 33:32.583
I told you.
I wasn't raped.

33:32.667 --> 33:35.500
Your handwriting gonna
match the wall,
Melinda?

33:36.500 --> 33:39.291
Huh, that was just
stupid writing.

33:39.375 --> 33:41.917
- It didn't mean anything.
- Sure it did.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.417
Then Shaina killed herself.
You had to make him pay.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.917
I never even met her.

33:49.667 --> 33:53.291
"No matter how much I
try,
I just want it to end.

33:53.375 --> 33:55.166
"I hope you
won't
be mad at me.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.208
"I'm just not
as strong as
you."

33:58.709 --> 34:00.917
Shaina's last
entry
in her diary.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.083
It's dedicated to you.

34:05.667 --> 34:07.208
"The women on the Wall."

34:13.500 --> 34:15.041
She was barely 18.

34:17.375 --> 34:18.625
A kid.

34:23.125 --> 34:25.000
It isn't fair
what he did to her.

34:26.333 --> 34:29.250
What he did to all of you.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.333
(Will)
'So you made a plan together.'

34:31.417 --> 34:33.750
Waited on the quad
till nightfall.

34:33.834 --> 34:35.750
Please, stop this.

34:35.834 --> 34:39.166
And then you
saw him, alone.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.625
Coming from a party?

34:41.709 --> 34:43.417
Or maybe
another girl's room?

34:45.291 --> 34:46.959
No one was gonna stop him.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.000
Except us.

34:50.083 --> 34:53.458
He had that stupid
smile on his face.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.041
Always that damn smile.

34:57.125 --> 34:59.667
But then he saw us.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.166
And he knew.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.125
- It was..
- Payback time.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.792
(Tessie)
'Say what you did to us.'

35:14.917 --> 35:16.000
What is this?

35:16.083 --> 35:17.166
You can't pretend
it didn't happen

35:17.250 --> 35:18.667
what you did to all of us.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.208
- Why? Why'd you do it?
- I didn't do anything.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.125
You raped us.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.917
Right. You're crazy.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.458
Say it.

35:30.291 --> 35:31.917
I don't have
to listen to this.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.583
- Say it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.542
'Say it.'

35:36.625 --> 35:37.625
Tessie, what are you doing, huh?

35:37.709 --> 35:39.709
Say it, you son of a bitch.

35:39.792 --> 35:41.083
Say what you did?

35:42.291 --> 35:44.709
Say it!

35:46.792 --> 35:48.375
He wet his pants.

35:49.917 --> 35:52.625
That little piece
of crap wet his own pants.

35:52.709 --> 35:54.417
How does it feel, huh?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.959
- Kill him.
- No. Oh, my God, Tessie,
don't.

35:57.041 --> 35:58.875
- Please.
- Kill him, Tessie, now, do
it.

35:58.959 --> 36:01.583
Okay, okay, okay.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.375
- 'Okay, I did it.'
- 'Say it!'

36:10.041 --> 36:12.250
I raped you. Okay?

36:14.125 --> 36:15.667
I'm so sorry.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.417
I'm sorry, please,
please don't shoot me.

36:19.667 --> 36:22.083
- 'Please.'
- I can't.

36:22.166 --> 36:25.834
What? Kill him now,
Tessie, do it!

36:28.291 --> 36:29.458
I won't do it.

36:29.542 --> 36:32.291
- I won't become him.
- Let's go home.

36:32.375 --> 36:33.917
(Karin)
'Please, Tessie.'

36:35.125 --> 36:36.458
Let's go home.

36:40.417 --> 36:43.125
Then we left him there.

36:43.208 --> 36:46.417
We went back to my dorm room
and stayed there until dawn.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.208
And that's when we
heard.
He was dead.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.291
I was glad.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.458
Thought it would
make us better.

36:56.625 --> 36:57.959
But it didn't.

37:00.208 --> 37:03.208
You were together
till the next
morning?

37:03.291 --> 37:06.834
All of you?
Even Tessie?

37:06.917 --> 37:09.542
No one left that room
until we got the news.

37:11.041 --> 37:13.458
Then why'd
Tessie's brother
lie?

37:13.542 --> 37:15.834
Said she was
with
him that night.

37:15.917 --> 37:17.583
'Cause he was her alibi.

37:20.083 --> 37:21.667
And she was his.

37:23.625 --> 37:25.208
My client isn't
saying another word.

37:25.291 --> 37:26.917
This isn't about your client.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.208
Trajectory of the bullet
indicates the shooter

37:29.291 --> 37:32.125
was five-four, five-two..

37:32.208 --> 37:33.875
...average sized female.

37:33.959 --> 37:36.208
Or a 12-year-old boy.

37:38.041 --> 37:40.625
Real protective,
weren't you,
Jimmy?

37:40.709 --> 37:41.792
Parents were dead.

37:41.875 --> 37:44.041
Making you the
man of the
family.

37:44.125 --> 37:45.834
You people are pathetic.

37:45.917 --> 37:47.000
Tessie, don't talk to them.

37:47.083 --> 37:49.417
(Scotty)
'Kids know more than we
think.'

37:49.500 --> 37:51.333
'Hear things, see things.'

37:51.417 --> 37:53.667
Bottle it all up inside.

37:53.750 --> 37:55.625
But it's killing you.

37:55.709 --> 37:57.458
He was just a kid.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.875
This is ridiculous.

38:00.083 --> 38:02.083
Tell them, Jimmy.
You were home,
right?

38:05.166 --> 38:07.166
Right?

38:07.250 --> 38:08.458
Jimmy?

38:11.208 --> 38:12.417
I saw him.

38:13.667 --> 38:14.709
Leave the apartment.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.542
I saw everything.

38:16.625 --> 38:19.166
Okay, I killed him.
I did it. Arrest me.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.333
(Jimmy)
'He wasn't sorry.'

38:21.417 --> 38:24.875
On the quad.
I-I followed you that night.

38:24.959 --> 38:26.333
I was supposed
to protect you--

38:26.417 --> 38:27.750
Jimmy, shut up!

38:27.834 --> 38:29.834
I am confessing, okay?
I killed that animal.

38:29.917 --> 38:31.917
- 'No, you didn't.'
- Jimmy, don't do this.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I picked up the gun.

38:36.125 --> 38:37.959
Stupid bitches.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.333
'Whores.'

38:51.625 --> 38:53.291
Then what happened?

38:55.917 --> 38:58.083
I had to
protect you,
Tess.

39:01.667 --> 39:03.709
Please don't do this to him.

39:03.792 --> 39:04.917
He was just a little boy.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Don't do this
to us, not again.

39:13.667 --> 39:16.041
You picked up the gun
because you were scared.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.083
You thought
you were in danger.

39:24.333 --> 39:27.583
Imminent danger,
didn't you, Jimmy?

39:27.667 --> 39:29.500
Is she doing
what I think she's
doin'?

39:31.333 --> 39:33.083
'Didn't..'

39:33.166 --> 39:35.250
I'm not hearing it. You?

39:39.375 --> 39:40.959
Tell them yes, Jimmy.

39:41.041 --> 39:44.583
You picked up the gun because
you thought you were in danger.

39:46.041 --> 39:48.875
Jimmy, do it for me, please.

39:48.959 --> 39:51.500
Just tell them
the truth.

39:55.041 --> 39:56.917
You're Tessie's
little brother?

39:58.709 --> 40:01.125
Jimmy, right?

40:01.208 --> 40:02.750
'She told me about you.'

40:05.166 --> 40:06.667
Come on, bud,
give me the gun.

40:09.709 --> 40:15.500
So what you're sayin'
then is he came at
you.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.250
Right?

40:18.333 --> 40:20.083
Grown man coming
at a 12-year-old boy

40:20.166 --> 40:22.333
who knows what he'd do?

40:22.417 --> 40:23.792
Threat to your life.

40:25.291 --> 40:27.250
Say yes, Jimmy. Please.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.166
I know
what you did to her.

40:32.250 --> 40:35.458
- To Tessie.
- You got it all wrong,
buddy.

40:37.917 --> 40:39.709
No, she said no.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.500
They all say that.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.041
They don't mean it.

40:46.250 --> 40:47.417
'You'll see one day.'

40:47.500 --> 40:49.417
I was there.
I heard everything.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.667
Between you and me, kid?

40:56.917 --> 40:58.417
Your sister was
one hell of a lay.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.458
Shut up!

40:59.542 --> 41:01.250
Then he moved in
for you, right?

41:02.458 --> 41:04.125
Left you no choice.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.834
(Scotty)
'You know the law.'

41:05.917 --> 41:07.917
You won't go away
for defending yourself.

41:09.792 --> 41:13.208
Because you had to shoot him,
didn't you, Jimmy?

41:16.583 --> 41:18.375
You're all I got left.

41:19.458 --> 41:21.000
Tell them.

41:22.291 --> 41:25.583
I couldn't let him
hurt you ever
again.

44:11.291 --> 44:12.583
