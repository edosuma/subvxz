38:52.485 --> 38:55.707
But from the heart of this
hospital, I'm here to offer one.

38:58.691 --> 39:02.560
Your pain can't even
be imagined, and I...

39:06.587 --> 39:10.147
I want you to know that
everyone here at Chastain is...

39:10.157 --> 39:11.690
we're just devastated.

39:14.870 --> 39:18.396
Your wife suffered what we refer to as

39:18.407 --> 39:20.466
a "never event,"

39:20.834 --> 39:24.528
something that should never happen.

39:25.375 --> 39:28.732
I can't tell you how sorry we are.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.742
(CRYING)

39:32.075 --> 39:34.404
♪ You may fall down... ♪

39:34.414 --> 39:37.875
MINA: Apologies are routine now
because they help prevent lawsuits.

39:37.885 --> 39:41.620
Most people who receive them
don't take legal action.

39:43.056 --> 39:46.225
He's not gonna get away with dodging
the consequences this time.

39:54.067 --> 39:56.253
(EXHALES)

39:56.504 --> 39:59.896
- Oh, I know. I'm as upset as you are.
- Not a chance.

39:59.907 --> 40:03.072
I saw it. I lived it.
I'll never forget it.

40:03.083 --> 40:05.572
Same day we save a mother
and son who by all rights

40:05.583 --> 40:09.419
should not have survived,
a young healthy woman dies.

40:13.053 --> 40:15.033
A tear in her bladder was fixable,

40:15.044 --> 40:18.318
and wouldn't have killed her
if she hadn't been ignored.

40:18.329 --> 40:20.417
And you'd better believe
I'm gonna identify

40:20.427 --> 40:22.586
whether it was
a series of system failures

40:22.596 --> 40:24.087
that led to this catastrophe...

40:24.097 --> 40:26.348
More than that was involved, Dr. Bell.

40:27.932 --> 40:29.834
I know what you're thinking.

40:31.866 --> 40:34.431
But I've known Dr. Stewart
and Nurse Colby for years.

40:34.441 --> 40:37.434
I've never seen either of them
treat a patient differently

40:37.444 --> 40:39.077
because of race.

40:42.410 --> 40:43.782
(SIGHS)

40:44.764 --> 40:48.253
People can have unconscious bias.

40:52.459 --> 40:54.688
You're absolutely right.

40:56.129 --> 40:58.463
This can't happen again.

41:04.538 --> 41:06.162
I have some ideas

41:06.180 --> 41:10.674
to safeguard every mother
that comes into this hospital.

41:11.432 --> 41:12.975
I'm listening.

41:13.547 --> 41:16.473
BELL: After yesterday's tragic event,

41:16.483 --> 41:18.784
we are gonna create
a review board to examine

41:18.795 --> 41:21.712
every maternal death
or near death in this hospital

41:21.722 --> 41:23.547
over the past few years.

41:23.557 --> 41:25.536
We're gonna pinpoint
the problems, and we're gonna

41:25.547 --> 41:27.883
implement a new standard
of care immediately.

41:27.896 --> 41:30.286
And these protocols will include
comprehensive checklists,

41:30.297 --> 41:32.956
maternal crash carts,
simulated training drills.

41:32.966 --> 41:35.792
We need communication and teamwork

41:35.802 --> 41:38.528
to prevent all forms of bias,
racial or otherwise.

41:38.538 --> 41:41.632
We need to ensure
that every person is heard.

41:41.642 --> 41:43.834
The United States
is the most dangerous country

41:43.844 --> 41:45.869
in the developed world to give birth in.

41:45.879 --> 41:48.005
There's no excuse for that.
