WEBVTT

00:26.125 --> 00:28.541
-On three? -

00:28.583 --> 00:31.666
I fail to see how a running start is going to help us get there any more quickly.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.083
Right now, we need all the speed we can get.

00:34.125 --> 00:36.291
So... three!

00:36.333 --> 00:38.333
Whoa!

00:38.375 --> 00:40.166
-Whoo! -Yeah!

01:06.250 --> 01:09.083
Hear me, Masters of the Universe.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.500
All hope is not yet lost.

01:13.208 --> 01:16.166
You saved us!

01:16.208 --> 01:19.166
-Thank you. -Not exactly.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.666
Yeah, this kind of whole spirit thing,

01:22.708 --> 01:24.416
we aren't really here.

01:24.458 --> 01:27.125
I suppose it's the thought that counts.

01:27.750 --> 01:28.958
We lost.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.041
I got cocky and led us into danger,

01:31.083 --> 01:32.708
and we--we lost.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.083
Take it from me:

01:34.125 --> 01:37.416
failure is but an opportunity to rise again,

01:37.458 --> 01:38.833
like a phoenix.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.750
Duncan!

01:42.791 --> 01:43.750
What's happening?

01:43.791 --> 01:45.958
Unchecked, Havoc grows,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.541
consumes and destroys all in its path.

01:48.583 --> 01:53.875
The Havoc in the pit is seizing on your individual pain and fear.

01:59.625 --> 02:00.666
Without our weapons,

02:00.708 --> 02:02.500
without the Power of Grayskull,

02:02.541 --> 02:04.291
what are we supposed to do to stop it?

02:04.333 --> 02:08.958
You do not need the Power of Grayskull to stay united.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.041
You merely need the desire to overcome...

02:13.125 --> 02:15.541
...to fight back.

02:17.541 --> 02:19.541
Together, you are never as helpless as you may feel.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.000
I have the Power!

04:06.666 --> 04:10.250
Does Dinky really think that glowy stuff can fix our gear?

04:10.291 --> 04:12.500
It's the same metal the sword is made from,

04:12.541 --> 04:15.166
and since it can channel the Power of Grayskull,

04:15.208 --> 04:18.541
the hope is that the Kirbinite Skeletor left behind

04:18.583 --> 04:21.166
should help the other weapons get back up and running too.

04:21.208 --> 04:24.083
It may also apparently blow us all up?

04:24.125 --> 04:25.958
What?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.041
I never said that.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.916
-But I heard you.

04:30.958 --> 04:33.750
-Right before Adam... -Thank you, by the way, for saving us.

04:33.791 --> 04:35.625
Don't thank me.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.208
Thank Eldress.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.833
Or at least Ork-O. He's the one that came and got me.

04:39.875 --> 04:41.458
Happy to be of service!

04:41.500 --> 04:42.875
This is my fight, though.

04:42.916 --> 04:46.375
Keldor's my uncle. It's my kingdom.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.083
I got us into this mess.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.625
I'll figure out some way to get us out of it.

04:50.666 --> 04:54.000
Even as He-Man, that's too much for you to handle.

04:55.875 --> 04:58.166
This is our fight too.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.625
Yeah.

05:00.666 --> 05:02.750
Why should you get to have all the fun, right?

05:02.791 --> 05:05.625
We do this together, just like Eldress said.

05:05.666 --> 05:07.208
All five of us?

05:08.750 --> 05:10.166
For now.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.375
If Eternos falls, the jungle won't be far behind.

05:13.416 --> 05:16.291
I gotta do what I gotta do to keep my family safe,

05:16.333 --> 05:18.500
just like you have to do what you have to do

05:18.541 --> 05:20.166
to protect yours.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.875
Not to pat myself too hard on the back,

05:30.916 --> 05:33.666
but, good job, me.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.750
Ah, classic Keldor.

05:35.791 --> 05:38.791
Counting his navits before they've hatched.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.708
Think it's time we tell him

05:40.750 --> 05:43.708
taking Eternos ain't exactly the only plan that's been in motion?

05:54.250 --> 05:57.208
Oh. Oh, no.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.625
Are you coup-blocking me with a coup of your own?

06:01.916 --> 06:05.458
Is there no honor among thieves?

06:05.500 --> 06:09.208
Beast Man thinks Skelly's playing it a little on the nose.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.291
Which is saying something,

06:11.333 --> 06:13.916
considering he doesn't have one.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.708
My dearest Trap-Jaw,

06:23.750 --> 06:26.166
I believe we've been played.

06:26.208 --> 06:30.875
Of course you've been played, you imperious imbeciles.

06:34.208 --> 06:37.625
Only a fool would think a mind like mine would be incapable

06:37.666 --> 06:40.833
of inferring your impending insurrection!

06:42.291 --> 06:44.833
That was a little big. Sorry. I...

06:44.875 --> 06:46.625
I was just feeling it, you know?

06:49.541 --> 06:54.041
I didn't need the Kirbinite to share Havoc with you.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.708
I needed the Kirbinite

06:57.750 --> 07:02.125
to allow me to use Havoc to control you,

07:02.166 --> 07:06.875
just as it allows me to control these red-breasted dolts.

07:06.916 --> 07:10.208
Go jump off a tall rock or whatever.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.958
Yes, Lord Skeletor.

07:14.625 --> 07:19.208
I alone determine when you have access to my Havoc.

07:19.250 --> 07:23.375
I alone decide what you will do with it and when.

07:23.416 --> 07:29.000
I am now the master of your universe!

07:30.125 --> 07:34.000
Yes, Lord Skeletor.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.750
Then rise, my Dark Masters...

07:38.791 --> 07:40.791
Ooh.

07:45.375 --> 07:48.333
...and wreak havoc!

08:03.750 --> 08:05.125
Ow.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.333
Sire, the Red Legion has returned.

08:07.375 --> 08:09.875
I thought they were attacking Prince Keldor!

08:11.958 --> 08:13.791
So did I.

08:18.625 --> 08:21.208
Have the engineers raise the new shield. Go!

08:40.125 --> 08:44.083
I suppose I should give them credit for trying.

08:44.125 --> 08:47.166
But the power of Havoc...

08:48.916 --> 08:52.125
...cannot be denied!

09:10.291 --> 09:12.375
Excellent work, Duncan.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.000
What is it?

09:16.041 --> 09:17.500
--The attack's already started.

09:17.541 --> 09:18.833
We've got this.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.166
We're the Masters of the Universe, right?

09:22.916 --> 09:24.791
I can't speak for the whole universe,

09:24.833 --> 09:28.041
but I'm at least the Master of Technology.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.916
Master of Magic.

09:30.958 --> 09:33.375
Master of the Wild.

09:33.416 --> 09:36.083
Master of Demolition, baby.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.333
Apologies.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.208
This is all just very exciting,

09:41.250 --> 09:42.958
like a story of old.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.833
Please continue.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.458
Then...

09:48.500 --> 09:51.166
by the Power of Grayskull!

10:29.500 --> 10:32.708
We have the Power!

10:36.625 --> 10:39.375
This is normal, right?

10:39.416 --> 10:41.916
Do... not... explode!

10:47.541 --> 10:49.791
See?

10:49.833 --> 10:51.791
Nothing to worry about!

10:53.625 --> 10:55.458
The Wind Raider  won't get us back to the city

10:55.500 --> 10:56.708
fast enough to save it, will it?

10:56.750 --> 10:58.250
That depends.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.833
How much of the city would you like to have saved?

11:00.875 --> 11:03.666
I wish there was some way to get us there faster.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.833
Whoa.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.583
Right.

11:20.625 --> 11:23.041
I can just think about doing stuff and it happens now.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.291
My bad.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.541
No, this is good.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.166
Lean into it,

11:30.208 --> 11:32.416
and stop those cannons on your way down!

11:38.583 --> 11:41.250
They're still under Skeletor's control.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.375
They can't help themselves.

11:53.666 --> 11:56.208
Disable, but don't destroy.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.541
Skeletor's staff is the source.

12:15.583 --> 12:18.583
If we break it, we save the soldiers from themselves,

12:18.625 --> 12:20.833
and maybe the city in the process.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.916
Yeah, but where is Skeletor?

12:48.125 --> 12:50.041
Going after my father.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.541
Time to go, Your Majesty.

12:53.666 --> 12:56.166
No. I've already failed my son.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.666
I won't fail my kingdom too.

12:58.708 --> 13:01.250
I will face Keldor myself.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.833
If only little brother had a face to face,

13:07.875 --> 13:08.833
am I right?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.333
Keldor.

13:10.375 --> 13:14.250
It's been a decade, and all I get is, "Keldor"?

13:14.291 --> 13:20.708
"Is he a ghost or a zombie? What foul specter doth stand before me?"

13:22.041 --> 13:25.250
Look, doesn't any of this shock and horrify you?

13:25.291 --> 13:27.625
Any of what? You get a haircut?

13:27.666 --> 13:29.541
-"Haircut"!

13:29.583 --> 13:32.958
There's the Randy I remember.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.041
Lord Skeletor deserves your respect.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.708
What has he done to you, my friend?

13:39.750 --> 13:42.958
RK units, arrest these fiends!

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
I may have pulled "maker override" on a few bots on our way in.

13:47.041 --> 13:50.250
Kronis and Evelyn, I presume?

13:50.291 --> 13:51.916
Guilty as charged.

13:51.958 --> 13:54.416
--Wait!

14:06.875 --> 14:10.916
Somebody get me a Battle Cat for my birthday!

14:10.958 --> 14:12.166
Pardon me, He-Man,

14:12.208 --> 14:15.083
but why won't you stay dead?

14:15.125 --> 14:16.125
Adam, run!

14:16.166 --> 14:17.458
Save yourself!

14:17.500 --> 14:21.125
Oh, so you know? Fantastic.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.958
Dolos, make him watch.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.625
Dark Masters, attack!

14:37.666 --> 14:39.166
Remember the plan.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.458
Break the staff, save Eternos.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.291
If you can hear me in there, General,

14:48.333 --> 14:52.208
I will find some way to save you and the others.

14:53.458 --> 14:56.875
-Lock him up! -

15:02.666 --> 15:05.708
RK, what is your designation?

15:08.083 --> 15:09.500
Ork-O, Your Highness.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.541
Pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.

15:11.583 --> 15:14.333
As in Okro the Great?

15:14.375 --> 15:16.750
I'm a work in progress.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.458
Follow me to freedom!

15:20.916 --> 15:22.125
No!

15:41.541 --> 15:43.708
I got it.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.500
My back.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.208
No!

16:02.375 --> 16:03.916
Give it up, Skeletor!

16:13.083 --> 16:14.791
He-Man, the king!

16:16.375 --> 16:18.125
What's it gonna be, kid?

16:18.166 --> 16:21.750
The staff or dear old Dad?

16:30.791 --> 16:32.375
Thank you, young lady.

16:32.416 --> 16:33.791
I didn't do it for you.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.041
You can't beat us.

16:44.083 --> 16:47.083
You couldn't before; you won't now.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.875
We let you separate us.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.625
That won't happen again.

16:51.666 --> 16:53.375
We're in this together!

17:43.166 --> 17:45.750
What was that?

17:45.791 --> 17:49.875
It would seem our upgraded weapons allow us to combine our skills.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.416
Last warning.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.958
Hand over the staff and no one needs to get hurt.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.416
I'm already hurt.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.875
What I need

17:56.916 --> 18:00.708
and what I want are two very different things.

18:00.750 --> 18:01.833
That's not good.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.750
While you've been busy fighting me,

18:03.791 --> 18:07.916
the Red Legion has been conscripting the rest of Randor's soldiers

18:07.958 --> 18:09.875
to our cause.

18:09.916 --> 18:12.583
And we won't stop fighting until we've saved every last one of them.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.625
Oh, I know.

18:14.666 --> 18:18.166
That's why I've dispatched the Legion to destroy the source of your power

18:18.208 --> 18:20.000
once and for all.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.416
They're going to destroy Grayskull!

18:22.458 --> 18:25.375
And there's nothing you can do about it.

18:25.416 --> 18:27.458
Guards, seize them.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.791
There's too many to fight off without hurting them.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.500
We need to fall back.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.250
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:33.291 --> 18:36.458
if I can have your attention, please.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.208
Abracadabra, abracadee.

18:39.250 --> 18:42.125
Our escape, you will not see!

18:44.666 --> 18:47.583
There's no hiding from me, He-Man.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.958
I can feel the power running through your veins.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.583
Find them!

18:55.791 --> 18:57.083
Skeletor's right.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.375
It won't be long before he finds us.

18:59.416 --> 19:01.208
I've got the Wind Raider on approach,

19:01.250 --> 19:03.416
but we'll never make it aboard with them on our heels.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.250
So we power down and lose them.

19:05.291 --> 19:08.166
Giving up the advantage when being hunted is the opposite of wise.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.291
You heard Ram Ma'am. Do it.

19:14.916 --> 19:16.458
I misjudged you, Adam.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.666
Or should I say He-Man?

19:18.708 --> 19:21.166
Go. Save the Power of Grayskull.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.791
Eternia needs it now more than ever.

19:23.833 --> 19:26.291
Without you? You can't stay here.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.833
I will not leave my people pinned beneath the heel of a tyrant.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.208
But if Skeletor finds you...

19:31.250 --> 19:32.416
He won't.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.833
I'll make sure of it.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.125
As will I.

19:37.375 --> 19:38.625
Hurry back.

19:38.666 --> 19:40.166
That's an order.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.375
Duncan, punch it.

19:48.416 --> 19:50.333
With aplomb, no less.

20:04.625 --> 20:07.041
Eldress, I don't know if you can hear me,

20:07.083 --> 20:09.291
but there's a mind-controlled army  with Havoc

20:09.333 --> 20:11.208
on its way to blow you up.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.041
Without being able to fight back,

20:13.083 --> 20:15.708
the castle will never withstand such an attack.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.750
Ask Eldress if her powers are like Teela's.

20:18.791 --> 20:21.041
Witchy moved us with her mind, right?

20:21.083 --> 20:22.791
Does that work for buildings too?

20:22.833 --> 20:25.166
Relocate the castle?

20:25.208 --> 20:26.625
In my weakened state,

20:26.666 --> 20:29.458
I'd have no way to control where we reemerged.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.416
Better than losing Grayskull altogether, right?

20:54.750 --> 20:58.791
And so a new adventure begins.

21:43.666 --> 21:46.958
How do I look?
