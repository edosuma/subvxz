00:12.214 --> 00:13.534
Hmm.

00:15.236 --> 00:17.452
Whoa, neat-o.

00:18.522 --> 00:19.920
How do you make it bigger?

00:20.013 --> 00:22.142
My magic skills
are seriously drained.

00:22.374 --> 00:25.006
Right now all I can do
is activate these thumbnails.

00:25.116 --> 00:27.022
Come on, guys.
Come on, guys.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.444
Let's work the problem.

00:28.519 --> 00:29.663
Let's fix Ooo.

00:29.734 --> 00:30.901
Come on, guys.

00:31.413 --> 00:33.116
I know I'm saying
"Come on, guys" a lot.

00:33.210 --> 00:35.178
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:35.357 --> 00:37.372
Hmm.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.039
Hey, if you need help turning
the pages, I'm your guy.

00:45.107 --> 00:46.797
I do this thing
where I lick my finger,

00:46.867 --> 00:49.404
and then the moisture helps grip
the corner of the page.

00:49.491 --> 00:51.079
I wonder if
the Enchiridion's been licked

00:51.146 --> 00:53.108
by, like,
thousands of wizards?

00:53.195 --> 00:54.842
I know how
to turn pages, man.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.390
I was
a graduate student!

00:56.516 --> 00:58.523
"Graduate student"?
What the heck is that?

00:58.593 --> 01:00.367
You graduated,
but you're still a student?

01:00.435 --> 01:02.071
Doesn't
make any sense.

01:02.382 --> 01:03.643
Where's the dog?

01:03.872 --> 01:05.524
Can the dog
do something about this?

01:05.672 --> 01:07.922
Okay, I'm a-comin'.

01:11.546 --> 01:12.695
You're wired, buddy.

01:12.788 --> 01:15.640
We've been going like
gangbusters since we got back.

01:22.391 --> 01:24.969
I don't got no time
for this nonsense!

01:25.280 --> 01:26.507
Shh, shh, shh.

01:26.726 --> 01:28.687
What are you doing?
Are you swaddling me?

01:28.831 --> 01:30.985
I'd hardly call this
swaddling.

01:31.078 --> 01:32.812
I'm just tucking you in.

01:33.422 --> 01:35.750
This feels nice.
Nice tucking, brother.

01:35.821 --> 01:38.250
40 winks
never hurt anybody.

01:40.162 --> 01:42.921
Yeah, a dozen top...

01:47.960 --> 01:50.685
Wait! That symbol,
I've seen it before.

01:50.882 --> 01:52.554
Oh, that's great!

01:52.702 --> 01:54.124
I'm proud of you, buddy.

01:55.288 --> 01:58.952
No, not you.
I said "buddy" not "Gunty."

02:05.852 --> 02:08.086
Jake was right.
I feel great.

02:08.154 --> 02:10.801
Hey Jake, you were... holy!

02:15.844 --> 02:16.888
Jake, wake up!

02:16.956 --> 02:18.525
Where's the rest
of the Cloud Kingdom?

02:18.693 --> 02:21.155
Huh?
Where's Simon and Betty?

02:21.569 --> 02:23.938
I guess we must've
broken off and floated away

02:24.072 --> 02:25.800
"loose-tooth-style."

02:25.887 --> 02:27.187
Why'd you let me
go to sleep?

02:27.255 --> 02:28.820
Look what happens
when you go to sleep!

02:28.888 --> 02:30.887
How're we gonna
get down from here?! How?!

02:31.464 --> 02:32.812
I can stretch us down.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.693
Oh. Yeah.

02:38.820 --> 02:39.896
Windy.

02:39.964 --> 02:43.093
What the jibbs, dude?
I can't even see the ground.

02:43.773 --> 02:44.999
Hmm.

02:45.710 --> 02:47.388
Hey, let's glide down!

02:47.456 --> 02:48.835
Yeah!

02:51.066 --> 02:53.874
I love gliding!
Yeah, Jake, yeah!

02:54.741 --> 02:55.997
Whoo-hoo!

02:56.249 --> 02:58.505
Oh, geez.
I got to go back for a sec.

02:58.573 --> 02:59.826
What? We just started.

02:59.949 --> 03:01.741
Got to go back!

03:02.585 --> 03:03.660
What is it?

03:03.843 --> 03:04.952
Tell me what's wrong.

03:05.073 --> 03:06.640
Emergency!

03:09.998 --> 03:12.130
Jake, why can't you just
go while you're gliding?

03:12.246 --> 03:13.393
We're on a clock here.

03:13.479 --> 03:14.841
Hey! Turn around.

03:14.936 --> 03:16.380
I can't go with you
looking at me.

03:16.611 --> 03:18.107
I'm sorry.

03:19.335 --> 03:21.005
I can't go
when I'm gliding.

03:21.073 --> 03:22.224
Feels weird.

03:22.344 --> 03:24.570
Just be quick, man.
Ooo needs us.

03:24.730 --> 03:26.627
What is that?
What?

03:26.869 --> 03:30.802
It's another little cloud,
but this one has a small door.

03:31.249 --> 03:32.834
Cloud with
a small door, Jake!

03:32.928 --> 03:34.966
Dude,
face the other way!

03:35.437 --> 03:37.084
Dude, it's getting away.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.221
Aw, it's hopeless.

03:39.577 --> 03:41.376
I got to wait until
I can go again.

03:41.546 --> 03:43.260
Just have to stop
thinking about it.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.112
Okay, come on, Jake.
You can do it.

03:45.249 --> 03:46.930
Come on, Jake.
Just stop thinking about it.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.988
Come on, Jake.
Come on, Jake.

03:49.373 --> 03:52.440
Listen, I don't even think
gliding is a good plan.

03:52.662 --> 03:54.773
We should sit tight,
chill out,

03:54.862 --> 03:57.334
and wait for Ice King
and Betty to look for us.

03:57.983 --> 03:59.084
You know what you need?

03:59.152 --> 04:00.580
What?

04:00.967 --> 04:02.499
A haircut?

04:02.881 --> 04:04.440
A haircut.

04:04.628 --> 04:08.174
♪♪

04:09.781 --> 04:12.439
Come on, man. We haven't
done this since we were kids.

04:12.617 --> 04:14.233
Yeah, but I bet it works.

04:14.311 --> 04:17.139
I bet it calms you
the jibbs down.

04:17.583 --> 04:18.834
Hmm.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.082
All right.

04:27.008 --> 04:29.283
Yes, sir, I sure
like cutting hair.

04:30.496 --> 04:31.467
Mr. Mertens?

04:31.535 --> 04:33.435
I know I'm just
a humble scissors jockey,

04:33.503 --> 04:35.996
but you've been coming in
my shop for almost 20 years.

04:36.184 --> 04:38.441
I can tell when you got
something on your mind.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.527
I think...

04:43.629 --> 04:45.448
I think what's
bugging me is...

04:45.527 --> 04:47.526
The haircut
therapy is working.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.577
All this
elemental stuff happened

04:49.664 --> 04:51.145
because I acted selfishly.

04:51.434 --> 04:52.452
Oh, yeah?

04:52.520 --> 04:54.270
It's like I'm
employee of the month

04:54.338 --> 04:56.912
at an ice cream store, and I get
someone to cover my shift,

04:56.980 --> 04:59.093
and when I come back, the place
is burned to the ground

04:59.160 --> 05:00.823
and everyone I love
is doomed.

05:00.965 --> 05:03.244
And now we're up here, and we
can't do anything to help.

05:03.418 --> 05:05.313
Did I secretly want
that to happen?

05:05.400 --> 05:07.969
Like, deep down inside,
was I afraid Fern

05:08.047 --> 05:09.083
would be better than me?

05:09.170 --> 05:11.586
And my lizard brain
put out bad vibes?

05:12.090 --> 05:13.734
I guess the worst part
of all is...

05:13.802 --> 05:16.094
All right, you're all done,
Mr. Mertens.

05:16.297 --> 05:17.391
How's it look?

05:17.660 --> 05:20.608
Jake! I was talking
about important stuff.

05:20.996 --> 05:23.590
Sorry. I always get
caught up in the haircut.

05:23.910 --> 05:25.168
Talcum?

05:25.568 --> 05:26.849
Enough calm!

05:27.160 --> 05:28.188
What are you doing?

05:28.285 --> 05:30.123
I'm doing something...

05:30.191 --> 05:32.308
for Ooo!

05:33.922 --> 05:36.761
Nothing we do will
help Ooo right now.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.987
Don't you get it?
I'm worried, too.

05:40.729 --> 05:42.979
I've been trying to
distract you from all this,

05:43.097 --> 05:46.054
but that doesn't mean I'm happy
with the way things are going.

05:46.386 --> 05:47.402
Jake.

05:47.589 --> 05:50.323
Look at all this beautiful
blue around us.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.139
It's pretty, right?

05:52.542 --> 05:54.119
But you know
what I've been thinking?

05:54.215 --> 05:55.510
What if we're dead?

05:55.766 --> 05:58.237
I didn't say it because
I didn't want to worry you.

05:58.417 --> 06:01.235
I'm the big brother, so I'm
supposed to keep it together.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.266
And, okay, say
I'm wrong about being dead.

06:04.385 --> 06:07.883
Here's the best case scenario...
My kids are candy zombies.

06:08.045 --> 06:10.705
And Lady is made out of
taffy or something!

06:11.291 --> 06:12.435
I've got
so many things

06:12.503 --> 06:14.354
to worry about
you don't even know.

06:14.503 --> 06:17.401
I try to keep my worries hidden,
but where does that send them?

06:17.612 --> 06:18.733
To my kidneys?

06:18.977 --> 06:20.336
That can't be good.

06:20.404 --> 06:22.000
Snip, snip.

06:22.846 --> 06:25.120
Being stuck on a cloud
isn't so bad.

06:25.222 --> 06:28.977
It's weird, but we've gotten out
of weirder situations, right?

06:29.144 --> 06:31.258
Right.
Do you want the back tapered?

06:31.326 --> 06:32.430
No, no thanks.

06:32.498 --> 06:34.582
Fade?
No fade.

06:35.159 --> 06:37.727
I feel a lot better
now, thanks.

06:37.910 --> 06:39.445
That'll be $6.50.

06:39.727 --> 06:40.948
Here's 7 bucks.

06:41.058 --> 06:43.516
You're too generous.
Here, take it, young man.

06:43.584 --> 06:45.609
- No, sir, please.
- I'll put it in your backpack.

06:45.677 --> 06:47.145
Please, sir,
I have my dignity.

06:57.391 --> 06:59.941
Well, whatever happens
in the future,

07:00.028 --> 07:01.496
I know what we should do.

07:01.564 --> 07:02.578
What?

07:02.646 --> 07:04.495
Open a barber shop.

07:04.709 --> 07:06.176
I could get into that.

07:06.244 --> 07:07.781
Maybe when I'm 35.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.278
It happens sooner
than you think.

Hey, there's
that cloud again.

07:42.566 --> 07:45.352
Hey, what's behind
that door, huh?

07:45.439 --> 07:47.141
It's what everybody's
been wondering.

07:47.228 --> 07:49.133
Yeah, maybe it's
our way out of here.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.524
What's behind
the door?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.180
It's...

07:53.354 --> 07:55.703
a cloud restroom.

07:56.504 --> 07:58.531
If you'll excuse me
for a minute.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.941
Don't look.

08:01.122 --> 08:02.369
There's a door.

08:02.456 --> 08:04.759
I don't care!
Don't look in this direction!

08:04.853 --> 08:08.035
It makes me feel like you can
hear my most private business.

08:13.871 --> 08:15.983
Hey, Jake!
It's not a toilet.

08:16.051 --> 08:17.767
It's some kind of angler lard!

08:17.851 --> 08:20.246
I don't care what it is,
I got to go.

08:20.394 --> 08:23.116
Wah! What the...?

08:23.645 --> 08:25.813
Hey, lard! Lard!

08:26.371 --> 08:27.875
Go away!

08:34.097 --> 08:35.166
Hold on, Jake.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.477
It's Super Bespoke Jacket Guy!

08:39.705 --> 08:42.982
Since when is it such a hassle
just to take a whiz?!

08:48.680 --> 08:51.892
Hey, lard, do you mind
if I call you Cloudy?

08:52.033 --> 08:55.350
Hey, Cloudy, what do you want
to eat a smelly old dog for?

08:55.627 --> 08:56.971
Thanks.

08:57.661 --> 08:59.078
Get a whiff of this.

08:59.610 --> 09:00.787
You like that?

09:01.025 --> 09:03.092
This is a bespoke
Ice King jacket.

09:03.236 --> 09:04.600
You got his
ancient man scent?

09:05.839 --> 09:08.501
Go get him, boy!

09:08.658 --> 09:10.236
Find the Ice King!

09:11.775 --> 09:13.361
Are you being
digested in there?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.834
Just a little.

09:15.234 --> 09:16.362
Hmph.

09:16.635 --> 09:18.619
'Scuse me.
Ouch!

09:19.200 --> 09:21.285
Thanks for not
digesting me.

09:22.033 --> 09:25.223
You know, the way I see it,
all this elemental stuff

09:25.291 --> 09:26.775
would have happened
no matter what.

09:26.885 --> 09:28.900
We're actually lucky
we were out of town.

09:29.010 --> 09:31.913
Nothing happened to us, so now
we have a chance to fix it.

09:32.181 --> 09:34.231
Thanks, Jake,
that's kind of comforting.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.431
I thought of it
in the bathroom.

09:39.406 --> 09:41.705
Hey, guys!
Guess who's back.

09:41.813 --> 09:43.703
Hmm, did you guys
leave or something?

09:44.476 --> 09:46.926
It's always good to see my bros.

09:47.143 --> 09:48.170
Ew.

09:48.277 --> 09:49.712
This is our new friend
Cloudy.

09:49.851 --> 09:51.864
He really wanted
to meet you.

09:52.127 --> 09:54.424
How did you like your
first taste of Ice King?

09:55.251 --> 09:57.112
It wasn't that great.

09:57.339 --> 09:59.738
The dog was better
tasting, actually.

09:59.895 --> 10:01.677
Although a little mangy.

10:01.803 --> 10:03.230
A food critic.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.995
Maybe this is what
you want, Cloudy!

10:05.063 --> 10:06.105
Go get it!

10:06.173 --> 10:07.834
Mmm!

10:07.963 --> 10:09.191
Dog. Dog. Dog.

10:09.259 --> 10:10.277
Oh, there you are.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.039
I made a real breakthrough.

10:12.107 --> 10:13.138
I think I've figured out

10:13.206 --> 10:16.003
exactly what we need to do
to repair Ooo.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.973
We can use the Enchiridion

10:19.060 --> 10:21.269
to create an elemental
counter-spell.

10:21.401 --> 10:23.917
First, we just need to retrieve
the three royal jewels

10:23.985 --> 10:26.010
from the crowns of
the elemental princesses.

10:26.078 --> 10:27.086
Easy.

10:27.154 --> 10:28.198
That's great!

10:28.325 --> 10:29.924
Finally a legit plan.

10:30.276 --> 10:31.788
Thanks for making me
chill, Jake.

10:31.856 --> 10:33.581
That really helped me out.

10:34.784 --> 10:38.012
Hey, did you guys
get haircuts?

10:38.394 --> 10:39.909
Without me?

10:40.979 --> 10:42.576
