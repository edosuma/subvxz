00:02.306 --> 00:04.047
Previously onSWAT...Nia Wells.

00:04.091 --> 00:05.005
Daniel Harrelson.
They call me Hondo, though.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.136
You're a prosecutor, huh?

00:06.180 --> 00:07.442
Deputy D.A.STREET: Are you saying

00:07.485 --> 00:08.834
you'd give me a chance?HONDO: I'm saying

00:08.878 --> 00:10.749
that I will
get you in SWAT Academy.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.447
Didn't you learn anything
while you were on the team?

00:12.490 --> 00:14.666
Devlin, show him
how it's done. Come here.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.016
If it were up to me,
you would not be in the Academy.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.279
You had your spot,
and you threw it away.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.846
Why doesn't Luca
want me back on the team?You got to remember,

00:20.890 --> 00:22.065
Luca's third-generation SWAT.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.719
He's got a family
legacy to protect.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.286
He's always had a rep for being
a tough evaluator.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.636
I'll talk to him.
But in the meantime,

00:27.679 --> 00:30.769
you show up, and you play hard.
Kick some ass.

00:30.813 --> 00:31.944
I will.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.209
It's-it's muffled.Just concentrate.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.254
What do you hear?

00:37.298 --> 00:38.821
I don't know. Men's voices?

00:38.864 --> 00:40.823
How many?Two?

00:40.866 --> 00:43.478
No. It's three.Anything else?

00:43.521 --> 00:45.393
They're arguing. Sounds
like it's getting heated.

00:45.436 --> 00:46.350
Okay, we got to make
an emergency entry.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.669
Nate.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.105
Cover me while I
check his pulse.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.280
Gas grenade.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.542
Mask up.

01:04.586 --> 01:05.848
Street, I forgot my mask.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.071
Now we got to establish
a heartbeat.

01:11.114 --> 01:13.508
Gun!

01:13.551 --> 01:14.552
DEVLIN:
Two suspects secured.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.380
[alarm buzzes]

01:16.424 --> 01:18.295
Nice job, recruits. Well done.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.776
[exhales] That would've been
three strikes for me, man.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.169
You didn't have to do that.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.127
Don't worry about it, man.
Good shot.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.129
If that were real tear gas, you
wouldn't have had much longer.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.130
Damn.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.784
You guys get faster every year.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.613
All right, I need, uh,
Devlin and Street to hang out

01:31.656 --> 01:33.484
till the scores go up. Everyone
else, enjoy your weekend.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.487
Hey. Didn't know you were here.Hey.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.794
I got to say, out of
this bunch, I think

01:38.837 --> 01:41.579
you're the most eligible one.
Real SWAT potential.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.973
Well, I appreciate that.
But with these budget cuts

01:44.016 --> 01:45.975
and only one open slot,

01:46.018 --> 01:47.759
Devlin's got me worried.
He's good.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.283
Hope it's not all for nothing.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.849
Sometimes you got to make
a wrong turn

01:50.893 --> 01:52.155
to get to the right place.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.331
Thanks.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.680
Don't really know what to do
with that advice,

01:55.724 --> 01:57.029
but I guess it's the feeling
that counts.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.598
Hey, thanks.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.167
HONDO:
You know, I never realize

02:04.211 --> 02:06.865
how much L.A. traffic bugs me
until I actually get out of it.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.911
[laughs] No kidding.

02:08.954 --> 02:12.088
Knew there had to be something
to love about Arizona.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.524
Thought you said
you were all about the desert.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.439
I lied. We'll see how long

02:15.483 --> 02:18.529
my new hairstyle lasts
in this heat.Oh.

02:18.573 --> 02:21.837
Black girl problems. [laughs][chuckles] Stupid.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.361
So, what's that mean?
No sightseeing for the weekend?

02:24.405 --> 02:26.189
Only what I can see from
the comfort of our hotel room.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.408
Oh, I like your style.

02:27.451 --> 02:28.757
Get your head out of the gutter.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.628
[laughs]:
Not just that.

02:30.672 --> 02:33.414
I have a dozen cases
to review before Monday.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.198
Fun part of my job.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.026
Dedication pays dividends,
right?That from the speech

02:37.069 --> 02:39.071
you're giving these cops?No, no.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.377
I keep my speeches
to a minimum.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.379
I like to
get them outside,

02:42.423 --> 02:43.859
do some training, tactical ops,
that sort of thing.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.122
Metro had the first SWAT
team. A lot of departments

02:46.166 --> 02:48.342
count on us to keep 'em current.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.300
What's the farthest they've sent
you to run one of these things?

02:50.344 --> 02:51.997
Guess that would be Berlin,
few years back.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.782
But we get calls
from all over.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.305
It's the fun part of my job.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.393
[music playing over radio]

02:56.437 --> 02:58.395
[siren wailing]

02:58.439 --> 03:00.092
Is that for us?

03:09.885 --> 03:12.061
[music stops]

03:18.546 --> 03:20.896
Afternoon, Officer.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.767
License and registration,
please.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.596
Sure thing.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.816
Both of you, please.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.472
Listen, sir, he's...

03:31.515 --> 03:32.864
I'm sorry,
I'm a little confused.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.084
If you don't mind
me asking you, uh,

03:35.127 --> 03:37.913
Officer Reid,
what'd you pull us over for?

03:37.956 --> 03:40.089
You made an aggressive
lane change back there.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.439
An aggressive lane change?Pop the trunk.

03:42.483 --> 03:43.484
You mind telling me
what you're looking for?

03:43.527 --> 03:45.442
Just pop your trunk.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.445
Officer, you can't check my car
without probable cause.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.273
You want to wait the hour
it's gonna take to get

03:50.317 --> 03:51.840
a drug-sniffing dog down here,
we could do that, too.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.325
No problem, Officer.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.022
[trunk pops]

04:02.154 --> 04:04.374
What are you doing?
Just tell him you're a cop.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.812
You and I both know exactly
what's going on here.No doubt.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.206
But that doesn't mean I want
to be a part of your little
social experiment.

04:10.250 --> 04:10.989
[trunk closes]

04:12.382 --> 04:13.557
Why the rental?

04:13.601 --> 04:15.211
We're in from California.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.082
When'd you arrive?We flew in an hour ago.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.823
What brings you to Arizona?

04:18.867 --> 04:22.392
His job. He's a police officer
and I'm a district attorney.

04:22.436 --> 04:23.828
Show him your badge, Hondo.

04:32.576 --> 04:33.969
Should've told me
you were a cop.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.579
Why?

04:37.146 --> 04:38.365
Sorry for the
trouble, Officer.

04:38.408 --> 04:39.801
Sergeant, actually.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.500
You have a good day, sir.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.197
Be careful driving now.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.985
Oh, we will.

04:57.906 --> 05:01.039
LAUREN:
Paul?

05:01.083 --> 05:03.477
What time is it? Are you just
getting back from work?

05:03.520 --> 05:06.262
Yeah. Not my fault
I get the crappy shifts.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.134
I mean, maybe you could
talk to your dad for me...

05:09.178 --> 05:11.136
I-I talked to him already.

05:11.180 --> 05:14.052
I'm sorry, he says that
it's an HR thing.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.576
Yeah.You wouldn't want
everyone thinking

05:15.619 --> 05:17.447
that you're getting
favoritism, right?

05:17.491 --> 05:20.363
No, but that doesn't mean I
don't want secret favoritism.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.584
Your dad owns 20%
of the Internet.

05:23.627 --> 05:27.631
Okay, Richard Tucker made
your last name a verb.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.372
Okay, like, kids
"tuck" each other videos.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.547
You know, tucking's a thing.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.375
What's your point?

05:32.419 --> 05:36.597
[sighs] He could promote me,
you know, if he wanted to.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.426
Well, maybe if you guys had met
under better circumstances.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.949
Oh, okay.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.168
You were the one who
wanted to get high

05:43.212 --> 05:44.300
before Thanksgiving dinner.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.302
[laughs]

05:47.956 --> 05:51.394
You know, my other
girlfriend, she, uh,

05:51.438 --> 05:53.440
she talks me up to-to her
billionaire father, so...

05:53.483 --> 05:55.355
Oh, yeah, my other boyfriend,

05:55.398 --> 05:57.182
he knows how to make
a good first impression.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.184
Oh...[knock on door]

05:59.228 --> 06:00.882
Who is it?WOMAN: I think I backed
into your car.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.928
I'm not sure how bad
the damage is.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.539
I'm really sorry.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.414
MAN: Sit down.Who are you?

06:11.458 --> 06:12.894
Where is the safe?
Where is the safe?!

06:12.937 --> 06:14.199
LAUREN:
There is no safe!

06:14.243 --> 06:17.072
[stammering] Take my bag,
it's right there.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.726
Okay, take the ATM card.
The-the pin...

06:18.769 --> 06:21.424
Be quiet, and no one
will get hurt.

06:22.991 --> 06:26.298
Help! Help!
Somebody, help me, please!

06:26.342 --> 06:30.128
Please help! Help me!
Somebody, help!

06:30.172 --> 06:33.262
Hey! Get your hands
off that girl!

06:33.305 --> 06:34.481
[gunshot]LAUREN: Please help me!

06:34.524 --> 06:35.569
Get back inside.[Lauren sobbing]

06:38.528 --> 06:40.922
What do you want?

06:44.534 --> 06:46.449
There's only room
for one of you.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.756
Cards up,
you each have evaluators

06:48.799 --> 06:50.845
ranking you as top
SWAT potential.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.803
So, I'm here to break the tie.

06:52.847 --> 06:55.023
Now, you've all been
through the ringer,

06:55.066 --> 06:57.155
so there's no use
in jerking you around.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.027
Now, based on the sniper skills
Vandelli insists

06:59.070 --> 07:01.116
that he needs for his squad,

07:01.159 --> 07:02.552
those four tours of duty
clinched it.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.381
Welcome to SWAT, Devlin.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.949
DEVLIN: Thank you, sir.
It's an honor.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.341
I'll work hard
to make you proud.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.475
There was a kidnapping
in Westwood.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.216
It's Richard Tucker's daughter.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.348
Come on, let's go.

07:16.392 --> 07:19.961
Hey, don't let this
get you down, Street.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.832
You got a bright future.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.322
HONDO [on phone]:
What do we know so far?

07:33.365 --> 07:35.803
No plates, no prints,
no decent photos.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.979
We do have dozens of videos
of the abduction,

07:38.022 --> 07:39.807
but the kidnappers wore masks.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.809
No one got even part of a face.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.550
Deac, Tucker's one of
the richest men on Earth.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.421
This is gonna ramp up
real fast.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.815
Well, don't worry about us.
We're on it.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.512
You let me know
if you need anything.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.514
You really shouldn't be going
out there a man down.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.820
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.868
The neighbor who shot the gun
in the air, he turn up yet?

07:57.912 --> 07:59.957
The guy didn't live in the
building; nobody here
has ever seen him before.

08:00.001 --> 08:00.915
Think he was in on it?I mean,

08:00.958 --> 08:02.133
it would make sense
if they wanted

08:02.177 --> 08:03.439
to keep anyone
from intervening.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.440
Yeah, he acts like a civilian,

08:04.484 --> 08:05.528
uses a gun to control the crowd,

08:05.572 --> 08:07.356
any would-be heroes.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.532
Just never seen a snatching
so coordinated.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.968
Mayor Barrett wants to talk.We'll call her back

08:11.012 --> 08:12.448
as soon as we speak
to the girl's father.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.536
No, she wants to talk
to the press.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.190
She's not on the phone.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.539
She's here?REPORTER:
Mayor Barrett. Mayor!

08:16.583 --> 08:20.021
Mayor Barrett! Do you just have
a couple comments?

08:20.064 --> 08:22.240
BARRETT: We were debriefed
on the way over here.

08:22.284 --> 08:26.288
The LAPD and my office are going
to do everything they can

08:26.331 --> 08:27.594
to find Lauren.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.421
L.A.'s got your back, Richard.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.206
Thank you.Do you have reason to believe

08:31.249 --> 08:32.860
your daughter's alive,
Mr. Tucker?

08:32.903 --> 08:33.861
I have no reason not to.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.341
[phones beeping]

08:36.385 --> 08:38.256
Oh, my God.

"Dad,

08:39.649 --> 08:43.479
I'm okay."Hostage video.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.568
"Paul and I are prisoners of war
because I'm a member

08:45.612 --> 08:47.570
"of a ruling class family.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.051
"But to ensure our release,
you must demonstrate

"two actions of good faith.

"First, you must donate

"Second, deposit $5 million
in Bitcoin to an account.

You'll receive an encrypted

09:07.198 --> 09:10.419
I hope you do
what they say, Daddy.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.247
The words they're making her
say, I knew I recognized them.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.597
Look, it's almost verbatim.
"Ruling class family."

09:14.641 --> 09:16.512
"Donation to the needy."
This is the SLA playbook.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.733
Okay, this is Patty Hearst 2.0.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.126
Patty Hearst? The kidnapped
heiress from the 70s?Yeah, that's the one.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.041
Whoever took Lauren is making
her do Patty Hearst's

09:24.085 --> 09:25.086
hostage statement
almost word for word.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.827
Why? What's it get them?

09:26.870 --> 09:27.741
I know what it got them
the first time.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.224
May 1974.
LAPD surrounded

09:33.268 --> 09:35.183
one of the Symbionese
Liberation Army hideouts,

09:35.226 --> 09:37.881
thinking Patty was inside,
but the SLA wouldn't surrender.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.580
Then they opened fire
on the cops.Looks like a war zone.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.277
Yeah, for two hours,
that neighborhood was.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.279
My grandfather was one
of the officers there.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.976
They nearly ran out of ammo.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.848
Biggest police shoot-out
in American history.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.720
How'd it get so out of control?DEACON:
Well, the SLA kept firing back.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.026
Even as their house burned
to the ground with
all of them in it.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.418
So, these copycats,
what's their endgame?

10:03.254 --> 10:05.169
♪

10:44.556 --> 10:46.080
For some, it's a badge.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.909
For us...It's a family crest.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.911
Where have I heard that?
Hand it here, Dad.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.130
I'm guessing it's
all hands on deck.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.697
The FBI's been
working up with RHD,

10:54.741 --> 10:57.352
and Forensics is dissecting
the hostage video.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.136
You know, I saw that
poor girl on the news--

10:59.180 --> 11:01.791
I grabbed your grandpa's old
case file and started driving.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.358
Oh, you know what I was
gonna do this morning?What's that?

11:03.401 --> 11:05.621
Crossword puzzle.[chuckles]

11:05.665 --> 11:09.016
Hey, remember how Gramps said
he'd, uh, rest when he's dead?

11:09.059 --> 11:11.627
Not today, Grandpa.Yeah, the man said a lot
of things he didn't mean.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.324
He only really meant it
if he wrote it down

11:13.368 --> 11:14.804
in one of his
damn journals.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.806
One of the few things
I'm glad he taught me.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.678
Yeah, I still keep one.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.988
Hey.Hey.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.642
I heard what happened
with selection.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.991
I'm sorry.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.776
If these budget cuts
ever end

11:29.819 --> 11:30.820
and SWAT can take on
more recruits,

11:30.864 --> 11:33.649
you'll be a shoo-in.Thanks.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.825
What do you think it's
like being so rich you
can't count your money?

11:35.869 --> 11:38.306
What's money worth if it gets
your daughter kidnapped?

11:38.349 --> 11:40.743
I got to go.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.659
Luca's dad is here.Okay.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.183
Carl was fresh out
of the Academy when his dad

11:46.227 --> 11:48.446
took over the Patty Hearst case
in L.A.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.145
It's hard to oversell
how big this was in 1974.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.624
With the newspapers
they owned, the Hearsts

11:52.668 --> 11:54.931
were one of the most influential
families in the world.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.237
When the SLA took Patty,

11:56.280 --> 11:58.543
the whole country
paid attention.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.544
If these were
ex-theater students,

11:59.588 --> 12:00.937
then why did it take
SWAT so long?

12:00.981 --> 12:02.504
They weren't just drama geeks.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.246
They were a combat unit intent
on starting a revolution.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.726
CARL: All they
needed was a leader.

12:06.769 --> 12:10.033
And they found one in
escaped convict Donald DeFreeze.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.470
Under DeFreeze, the SLA started
robbing banks in the Bay Area.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.777
They assassinated
a superintendent

12:14.821 --> 12:15.952
with a cyanide-laced bullet.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.215
Then they kidnapped Patty

12:18.259 --> 12:19.782
and started making
crazy demands.

12:19.826 --> 12:20.827
They said her
parents had to feed

12:20.870 --> 12:22.132
all the hungry
people in California

12:22.176 --> 12:23.873
if they wanted to see
their daughter alive.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.353
What'd her parents do?They tried.

12:25.396 --> 12:27.311
They had trucks drop off
millions of dollars worth

12:27.355 --> 12:29.705
of food to Oakland's
poorest neighborhoods.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.967
DEACON: It wasn't
enough for the SLA.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.664
They shuttled Patty
from hideout to hideout.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.841
After a few months, she started
identifying with her captors.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.233
HICKS: She started assisting
in their crimes.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.191
Grand theft
auto, assault,

12:37.234 --> 12:39.541
shot up
a sporting goods store.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.673
It all ended with
that shoot-out on 54th Street?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.806
You could say that's
where it all started for us.Yeah.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.503
That's where the 54 comes from.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.984
Groups like the SLA
are why SWAT exists.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.204
Luca, post up
with your dad,

12:50.247 --> 12:51.858
dig through
your grandfather's journals.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.250
[laughs]: There was no cop
as thorough as Jack.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.905
If they're trying
to recreate this crime,

12:55.949 --> 12:57.080
his notes are invaluable.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.908
Crime scene photos,
witness reports,

12:58.952 --> 13:00.692
things that never made
the official record.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.520
Everyone else is on patrol
with your eyes peeled.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.435
Great.All right.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.657
I heard the selection
didn't go your way.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.095
Trust me,
I know how you feel.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.967
I didn't make it onto SWAT
until my second time.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.099
I'm just upset at myself
for losing the spot I had.

13:16.143 --> 13:19.363
What if I told you I could get
you one day back on SWAT?

13:19.407 --> 13:21.670
Just for one day,
till we find her.

13:21.713 --> 13:24.107
Really?
Yeah.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.283
[laughs]: Yeah, yeah,
I won't let you down. Thank you.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.894
Well, you can
thank Hondo later.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.679
This was his call. Let's go.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.637
Right.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.729
We won't tell you what to do,
but we can walk you through

13:37.773 --> 13:39.340
how these things usually go.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.603
You deal with a lot
of $50 million ransoms?

13:41.646 --> 13:43.300
JESSICA: No.
Just keep in mind

13:43.344 --> 13:45.433
that whatever you decide,
the chances are

13:45.476 --> 13:47.478
they won't release
your daughter and her boyfriend.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.219
In the meantime,
every department has

13:49.263 --> 13:51.134
their best officers
scouring L.A.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.875
These people demanded
$50 million for charity.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.355
Does this sound like
this is a group that wants

13:54.398 --> 13:56.574
to harm my daughter?Trying to appease the SLA,

13:56.618 --> 13:58.228
it didn't work for the Hearsts.

13:58.272 --> 14:03.668
Ah. All the Hearst stuff.
I get it.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.670
The Hearsts owned newspapers,
and I'm social media,

14:05.714 --> 14:08.760
so I must be today's
Randolph Hearst.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.372
But I'm not. I'm richer.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.809
I can pay every cent of this
ransom and still be wealthier

14:13.853 --> 14:15.550
than I ever imagined.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.378
It may not only be about money.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.510
Everything's about money.Well, if that's true,

14:19.554 --> 14:23.558
then as long as you hold onto
yours, they'll keep Lauren safe.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.038
Don't pay.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.778
Not yet.JESSICA:
Just give us

14:26.822 --> 14:28.128
more time to track them down.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.566
HONDO: You've surrounded a house
with a heavily armed suspect

14:31.609 --> 14:33.655
barricaded inside.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.918
You pumped hot gas into it,
but he still won't come out.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.137
What next?

14:37.180 --> 14:38.660
Cut the water main.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.183
Why?So he can't stand

14:40.227 --> 14:41.402
in a running shower
to avoid the gas.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.664
Salazar, my man.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.144
That's two for two. Good job.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.885
Now, even if you
already know this,

14:45.928 --> 14:48.017
it's worth it to hear it again:

14:48.061 --> 14:51.281
chemical agents are only needed
if all other options fail.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.544
Now, if a suspect is injured
or negotiating,

14:53.588 --> 14:55.416
then he's probably on the road
to surrender.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.071
What if cutting the water main
doesn't work either?

14:58.114 --> 14:59.637
He's either got a gas mask
or a death wish.

14:59.681 --> 15:03.032
This group that took
the Tucker girl in L.A.,

15:03.076 --> 15:04.686
if you knew where they were
holed up, what would you do?

15:04.729 --> 15:05.817
We'd tread carefully.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.515
You never underestimate groups

15:07.558 --> 15:09.473
that have been able
to pre-plan on a home base.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.301
All right, that's enough
questions for right now.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.347
Go get changed,

15:13.390 --> 15:15.566
grab a bite to eat, I'll
see you on the range in 30.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.220
BRAUN: Hell, I wish they'd
listen to me like that.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.179
These guys worship you.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.224
It's not me,
it's just my job title.

15:21.268 --> 15:24.967
Deputy Chief, do you know
an Officer Reid, State Troopers?

15:25.011 --> 15:27.274
Yeah, Mike Reid.

15:27.317 --> 15:30.103
Think he came over
from City a few years ago. Why?

15:30.146 --> 15:32.409
I'd like to have a word
with him, in person.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.845
You think
that's possible?

15:33.889 --> 15:34.672
Yeah, I can find out.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.893
Appreciate it.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.939
[sighs]

15:42.245 --> 15:44.073
What's with all the herbal crap?
Where's the soda?

15:44.117 --> 15:46.249
Brass got rid of it.
It's a new policy.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.251
Same old control freaks.Holy smokes.
Listen to this.

15:48.295 --> 15:51.820
"May 9, 1974.
Told my men that if they have

15:51.863 --> 15:54.997
any unregistered guns, they can
consider them LAPD issue."

15:55.041 --> 15:56.781
Yeah, it's a different time.

15:56.825 --> 16:00.568
Spring of 1974, you
were in diapers.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.352
Ah, the old man wrote here
he took you fishing.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.920
I thought he hated fishing.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.704
"Took Buddy Boy to the lake.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.011
He spent most of his time
trying to eat worms."

16:09.055 --> 16:11.709
I've seen what's in that fridge.
Your diet hasn't changed much.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.711
"Buddy Boy."
I forgot about that.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.018
[phone vibrating]You hear that?

16:19.108 --> 16:21.806
LUCA:
It's Lauren's cell phone.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.592
Look, stay here, Dad,
I'll be right back.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.899
Tell me your lawyers
didn't just wire $50 million

16:27.943 --> 16:29.510
to the Committee
for the Poor.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.077
Gonna be one hell
of a write-off.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.992
And the $5 million
for this group?

16:33.035 --> 16:35.516
Bitcoin's already
been deposited.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.039
Hey, her cell got a text.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.606
Kidnappers dropped off
Lauren and Paul

16:38.649 --> 16:40.173
in that vacant industrial park
over on Eastern.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.392
HICKS: Every officer
in that area now.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.090
See?

16:47.963 --> 16:49.660
Lauren and Paul could be gagged.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.406
So you just worry about
giving us one good day.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.451
Understood.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.584
What's that?

17:00.628 --> 17:04.327
What's that covering?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.547
Two bodies?

17:10.725 --> 17:11.813
So where are they?

17:13.293 --> 17:15.991
This is a holdup![people screaming]

17:16.035 --> 17:18.428
First one doesn't lay down
gets shot in the head!

17:18.472 --> 17:20.691
Stay on the wall.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.258
DISPATCH:
211. All units.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.346
Robbery in progress
at MacArthur Bank.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.565
Subjects are armed
and dangerous.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.306
That's five blocks away.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.917
30-David, we're crossing
Main and 6th. Hold on.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.093
MAN:
Put it in the bag!

17:31.137 --> 17:32.529
I-I will, I will, I will...Come on.

17:32.573 --> 17:33.617
All of it. Let's go.I am, I am...

17:33.661 --> 17:34.923
Hurry up!

17:34.966 --> 17:37.621
Pick it up.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.014
Take a video of her.

17:43.540 --> 17:48.415
First person picks his head up,
I'll blow it off.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.026
[people screaming]Come on! Running out of time.

17:51.070 --> 17:51.896
[siren wailing]

17:55.465 --> 17:57.598
Lauren's I.D. All cut up.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.601
This is exactly what the SLA
sent to the newspapers in 1974.

18:00.644 --> 18:01.906
These are instructions.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.821
They want her dad to post
whatever's on this

18:03.865 --> 18:05.214
to his personal Tuck page.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.216
[tires screeching]

18:18.880 --> 18:19.924
Free money! Come and get it!

18:23.102 --> 18:24.233
[crowd clamoring]

18:25.843 --> 18:28.194
MAN:
Make it rain!

18:38.160 --> 18:43.470
First person picks his head up,
I'll blow it off!

18:43.513 --> 18:45.254
BARRETT:
Lauren's weapon

18:45.298 --> 18:48.039
fired blanks,
which is why the police believe

18:48.083 --> 18:51.347
that she was acting
under duress at the bank.

18:51.391 --> 18:54.176
Her kidnappers
seemingly forced her

18:54.220 --> 18:56.831
to reenact
the Patty Hearst saga.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.704
I paid every penny.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.490
I posted your message on Tuck.

19:03.533 --> 19:07.102
Let my daughter
and her boyfriend go.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.278
Please.

19:09.322 --> 19:12.063
At the group's insistence,
Richard Tucker uploaded a video

19:12.107 --> 19:14.283
in which Lauren delivers
an alarming message.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.285
LAUREN: The time for people
to treat each other better

Safe bet they're inside.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.668

29:23.109 --> 29:24.414
They're not gonna
surrender.
We got to
get Lauren out

29:24.458 --> 29:27.069
before they start reenacting
another shoot-out.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.462
Yeah, if she's even here.All right,
as soon as they show

29:28.505 --> 29:30.029
the least bit
of resistance,

29:30.072 --> 29:31.291
we make a move.Aye.

Leave your weapons inside.

have, leave them inside.

we give them everything
we got, you understand?

Keep your guns down.

Okay, lookit.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.807
Those bullet holes, they're
in a perfectly straight line.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.417
Yeah, they're using
a machine gun.No, but look closer, okay?

30:10.460 --> 30:12.636
They're all
six inches apart.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.942
There's dozens of holes,

30:13.986 --> 30:16.075
exactly six inches
between them.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.380
Bullets sweeping that

you can rake a shot with
a machine gun like that.

LUCAS: Unless this gun's
on an automated system.

This is all a setup
to take us out.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.735
Yeah, but we still need
to know if Lauren's inside.

is that Lauren and her boyfriend
made it home.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.997
Now, this manhunt

33:39.713 --> 33:41.497
Really think I'd use
a day like this

33:41.541 --> 33:43.673
to ask her for
more personnel?

33:43.717 --> 33:46.241
Well, you know me
too well, Captain.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.287
I know it feels like
the bad guys got away,

33:48.330 --> 33:50.028

be proud, all of you.

We did what SWAT never
could in the '70s.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.119
We got her home.

FBI picked her up

33:57.296 --> 33:59.254
15 months later
in San Francisco.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.690
She served two
years in jail

34:00.734 --> 34:02.083
before her sentence
got commuted.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.042
Didn't she marry
her bodyguard or something?

34:04.085 --> 34:05.869
That was the biggest blow
to the SLA.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.436
She didn't just
marry her bodyguard,

34:07.480 --> 34:08.481
she became a cop's wife.

of a choice. [chuckles]

All right, look here,
you and me, we're gonna

34:50.958 --> 34:52.829
clear something up
right now, cop to cop.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.396
I think I know what
this is about,

34:54.440 --> 34:55.702
and I never would've
pulled you over

34:55.745 --> 34:57.530
if I knew that
you were a cop.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.314
You really gonna
play it like that?

I know this game
really well.

[chuckles] You don't think this
is some kind of racial thing,

35:07.540 --> 35:09.150
do you?
You tell me.

35:09.194 --> 35:12.762
I saw you make a hard
lane change in a rental car.

35:12.806 --> 35:14.808
We're in a border community.
You have any idea

35:14.851 --> 35:16.201
how many smugglers
use rental cars?

35:16.244 --> 35:17.506
They fly in, rent cars,

35:17.550 --> 35:19.595
then they go pick up
a stash of drugs they left

35:19.639 --> 35:21.380
in the desert.I hear all that,

35:21.423 --> 35:22.729
but that ain't why
you stopped me.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.731
Actually, it is.No, it ain't.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.820
I've been doing
this job for 20 years,

35:26.863 --> 35:28.648
and not only have I never
pulled anybody over

35:28.691 --> 35:31.564
for an "aggressive lane change,"
I've never met a cop who has.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.479
Now, you said it
yourself.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.437
You sensed that I wasn't
from around here.

35:35.481 --> 35:38.005
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

35:38.048 --> 35:39.746
how'd you get
that sense, Officer?

35:39.789 --> 35:42.401
[scoffs]

35:42.444 --> 35:45.186
I'm sorry you feel this way,

35:45.230 --> 35:47.057
but this is your hang-up,
not mine.

35:47.101 --> 35:49.495
Oh, so I'm just
making this up?

35:49.538 --> 35:52.759
Not only am I potentially
a thug, but I'm crazy, too?

35:52.802 --> 35:56.197
I don't know
what you are,

35:56.241 --> 35:59.200
but I do know that this is,
uh, this is really sad.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.811
How many times you been pulled
over in your life, Officer?

36:01.855 --> 36:03.030
A couple.Yeah, well, yesterday

36:03.073 --> 36:04.988
makes 17 for me.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.773
So what do you really
think the difference is

36:06.816 --> 36:08.992
between you and me?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.737
Maybe I know to keep my vehicle
in its designated lane.

36:17.784 --> 36:19.699
Have a good day, Sergeant.

36:36.455 --> 36:39.109
I'm gonna take off.

36:39.153 --> 36:40.807
Your mother doesn't want me
driving at night.

36:40.850 --> 36:41.938
[chuckles]

36:41.982 --> 36:43.897
It's kind of humiliating,
actually.

36:43.940 --> 36:44.985
Well, thanks for
everything today, Dad.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.865
What your grandpa wrote about

36:55.909 --> 37:00.261
hoping you didn't end up
becoming a cop...

37:00.305 --> 37:03.525
If it weren't for me pushing,

37:03.569 --> 37:05.745
did you even want to join
the police force?

37:05.788 --> 37:08.226
No, I mean, to be honest,

37:08.269 --> 37:10.619
I can't ever remember
wanting to be anything else.

37:10.663 --> 37:13.100
Yeah.

37:13.143 --> 37:16.103
But you knew you
could've been, right?

37:16.146 --> 37:17.670
You didn't do it for me, I hope.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.672
Hey.

37:19.715 --> 37:23.676
You didn't make me
want to be a cop, Dad.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.721
You made me want to be like you.

37:25.765 --> 37:29.508
Gramps got
one thing right.

37:29.551 --> 37:32.511
You're by far the better father,

37:32.554 --> 37:35.731
till the day I pass you up.

37:35.775 --> 37:38.038
[chuckles]: I hate to
break it to you, son,

37:38.081 --> 37:41.563
but, eventually, you're gonna
need a woman for that.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.348
That fool had the nerve
to act like

37:43.391 --> 37:46.307
I was the one
making it about race.

37:46.351 --> 37:49.876
He just stood there acting like
he was taking the high road.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.312
And?

37:51.356 --> 37:53.706
[scoffs] And?

37:53.749 --> 37:56.970
I wanted to beat his ass.

37:57.013 --> 38:01.583
So, why didn't you?

38:01.627 --> 38:03.542
You know why.

38:03.585 --> 38:07.023
Because it's a catch-22.

38:07.067 --> 38:09.548
You beat his ass
and he feels vindicated

38:09.591 --> 38:11.680
that your inner thug came out.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.336
How many times
have you heard

38:15.380 --> 38:17.207
mess like this
from people like Reid?

38:17.251 --> 38:19.297
Too many times to count.

38:21.647 --> 38:24.171
So why did you think
this conversation

38:24.214 --> 38:26.956
would be different?

38:27.000 --> 38:30.482
I'm just sick of it
always being the same.

38:30.525 --> 38:33.572
There are still too many
Reids out there.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.443
I have been choosing
not to lay hands

38:35.487 --> 38:37.967
on guys like him
for a long time.

38:40.143 --> 38:44.583
To help things change.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.976
But when do
things change?

38:49.457 --> 38:50.632
I get that.

38:59.989 --> 39:03.428
You need space.

39:03.471 --> 39:06.126
I'll go get ice
for the champagne.

39:10.696 --> 39:14.482
[door opens, closes]

39:26.668 --> 39:29.062
Ready for that beer?Yeah.

39:29.105 --> 39:30.890
My treat.No, you don't owe me.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.022
HICKS: Hey. Fine job
out there today, you two.

39:33.066 --> 39:35.634
I was hoping to get
you alone, but, uh,

39:35.677 --> 39:37.244
I know Chris here
has been an ally,

39:37.287 --> 39:39.594
so there's no need
for secrets.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.423
Now, these budget cuts,
they created a lot of strain,

39:42.467 --> 39:46.166
and no one's been immune, even
some of our senior officers.

39:46.209 --> 39:47.559
In fact, just today,

39:47.602 --> 39:49.212
two of them were approved
for early retirement,

39:49.256 --> 39:51.824
and you were our second choice

39:51.867 --> 39:53.521
after Devlin.
That said,

39:53.565 --> 39:55.218
I called Hondo,

39:55.262 --> 39:58.439
and, um, well,

39:58.483 --> 40:01.442
we both agree we want you back
on SWAT on a probationary basis.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.792
[laughs] Really?Yes. No way.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.228
Probationary.
Yes.

40:05.272 --> 40:07.274
So, that means you keep it
clean and solid,

40:07.317 --> 40:09.798
then we'll see where we are
in six months.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.452
Yes, sir. Whatever it takes.

40:11.496 --> 40:12.671
All right, good.Thank you.

40:14.324 --> 40:15.543
[distorted]:
Its purpose?

40:15.587 --> 40:17.197
What the hell?To expose an illness

40:17.240 --> 40:18.633
that's festering in our country.STREET: That's them.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.548
Is this going out live?Yeah, to everyone.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.638
This society is sick, and you
have only yourselves to blame.

40:23.682 --> 40:26.728
Your police?
They aren't protecting you.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.774
They're keeping you in line.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.384
Your politicians
don't represent you,

40:30.428 --> 40:32.734
they represent the corporations
that put them in power.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.257
And you eat it all up,

40:34.301 --> 40:37.478
while your media
laughs their way to the bank.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.219
It shouldn't take
revolutionaries like us

40:39.262 --> 40:43.310
to hold these institutions,
these billionaires, to account.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.486
So we hope you enjoyed
our little show.

40:45.530 --> 40:49.272
You can consider this
your final warning.

40:49.316 --> 40:51.492
Be good to each other,

40:51.536 --> 40:53.494
or we'll be back

40:53.538 --> 40:56.541
with an all-new,
much bigger show.

41:09.467 --> 41:13.296
You really showed
that lamp.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.994
Better than
punching him, though.

41:18.954 --> 41:22.044
I'm sorry.

41:22.088 --> 41:24.830
That ain't me.

41:24.873 --> 41:27.659
I know.

41:27.702 --> 41:31.314
Let's get out of here.

41:31.358 --> 41:34.013
[sighs]

41:34.056 --> 41:35.536
Yeah.

41:39.192 --> 41:40.106
[knocking on door]

41:42.500 --> 41:44.850
Mrs. Harrelson?No.

41:44.893 --> 41:48.331
Somebody mentioned a commotion
coming from this room.

41:48.375 --> 41:50.551
Is everything okay?Nothing to worry about.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.162
We're checking out early.
A little damage to the room.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.556
Have them put it on
the credit card on file.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.862
Of course.
