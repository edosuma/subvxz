WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:06.502
My name is Shake-Zula

00:06.535 --> 00:07.536
The Mic Ruler

00:07.569 --> 00:08.570
The Old-Schooler

00:08.604 --> 00:09.538
You want to trip?

00:09.571 --> 00:10.772
I'll bring it to you.

00:10.806 --> 00:12.774
Frylock, and I'm on top

00:12.808 --> 00:13.809
rock you like a cop

00:13.842 --> 00:15.043
Meatwad, you up next

00:15.076 --> 00:16.577
with your knock-knock.

00:16.611 --> 00:19.213
Meatwad make the money, see?

00:19.247 --> 00:21.782
Meatwad get the honeys, g.

00:21.816 --> 00:22.950
Drivin' in my car

00:22.983 --> 00:24.184
livin' like a star

00:24.218 --> 00:26.086
ice on my fingers and my toes

00:26.120 --> 00:27.521
and I'm a Taurus.

00:27.554 --> 00:29.856
Uh, check, check it, yeah.

00:29.889 --> 00:32.191
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:32.225 --> 00:33.592
make the homeys say ho

00:33.626 --> 00:35.561
and the girlies want to scream.

00:35.594 --> 00:37.530
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:37.563 --> 00:39.031
make the homeys say ho

00:39.064 --> 00:41.533
and the girlies want to scream ?

00:41.566 --> 00:43.301
"Aqua Teen Hunger Force."

00:43.335 --> 00:45.703
Number One in the hood, g.

00:48.773 --> 00:49.874
Hello.

00:49.907 --> 00:51.375
Hello?

00:51.408 --> 00:52.343
Hello.

00:52.376 --> 00:53.144
Hello?

00:53.177 --> 00:54.511
Hello.

00:54.545 --> 00:56.012
Hello?

00:56.046 --> 00:56.813
Hello.

00:56.847 --> 00:57.547
Hello.

00:57.581 --> 00:58.481
I'm here.

00:58.514 --> 01:00.050
Oh, ok. Hey, man.

01:00.083 --> 01:02.325
How's it going?

01:02.358 --> 01:02.958
You know what time it is?

01:02.992 --> 01:03.659
Do you?

01:03.693 --> 01:06.128
Because it's 4:20 somewhere.

01:06.161 --> 01:08.964
I know that.

01:08.998 --> 01:09.964
Ain't that the phrase?

01:09.999 --> 01:10.865
Are you drunk?

01:10.898 --> 01:11.733
Mm-hmm.

01:11.766 --> 01:12.601
Give me that phone!

01:12.634 --> 01:13.868
Look, before I start speaking,

01:13.902 --> 01:14.736
don't even think about

01:14.769 --> 01:16.337
getting angry because if you do,

01:16.370 --> 01:18.072
I swear that I will

01:18.106 --> 01:19.373
hang up on you.

01:19.407 --> 01:20.474
Shake, what is it?

01:20.508 --> 01:21.174
What's wrong?

01:21.208 --> 01:22.075
Ok, you're jumping in

01:22.109 --> 01:23.276
already. Ok.

01:23.310 --> 01:25.245
We got into a little bit

01:25.278 --> 01:26.546
of trouble.

01:26.579 --> 01:27.914
Tell him nothing's wrong.

01:27.947 --> 01:29.416
But let me preface by saying

01:29.449 --> 01:30.483
we were framed.

01:30.517 --> 01:31.383
What?

01:31.418 --> 01:32.418
We were just the guys

01:32.451 --> 01:33.485
that happened to be there.

01:33.519 --> 01:34.486
We were framed!

01:34.520 --> 01:35.554
It was a total setup.

01:35.587 --> 01:37.123
All right, what was a setup?

01:37.156 --> 01:39.825
Wow. Now, why would I talk

01:39.858 --> 01:41.392
to someone who speaks to me

01:41.426 --> 01:42.560
in that tone?

01:42.593 --> 01:43.294
Will you just tell me

01:43.328 --> 01:44.529
what it is you did wrong?

01:44.562 --> 01:45.596
Oh, what? You think

01:45.630 --> 01:47.765
you do everything right?

01:47.798 --> 01:48.566
Ok. I see what's

01:48.599 --> 01:49.500
happening here--you got

01:49.534 --> 01:50.567
another D.U.I., didn't you?

01:50.601 --> 01:51.501
Hang up on his ass.

01:51.535 --> 01:52.302
I'm going to have to

01:52.336 --> 01:53.103
bus down there, ok?

01:53.137 --> 01:53.903
I'm going to have to take

01:53.937 --> 01:55.405
the bus from now on permanently,

01:55.439 --> 01:56.205
according to what

01:56.240 --> 01:57.407
some guy told me, and I ain't

01:57.441 --> 01:58.908
riding that cheese box!

01:58.942 --> 02:00.243
It's a major deterrent

02:00.276 --> 02:01.777
for the women.

02:01.810 --> 02:02.918
Women will not kiss you

02:02.951 --> 02:03.986
on the bus.

02:04.019 --> 02:04.920
Ok, look. This is

02:04.953 --> 02:05.854
going to take me a while.

02:05.888 --> 02:06.755
Hang up on him.

02:08.657 --> 02:09.792
Hey, Fry Man,

02:09.824 --> 02:11.959
I got this post-it note that was

02:11.993 --> 02:13.728
left on the curb for me.

02:13.761 --> 02:16.097
"Thanks for car. M.S."

02:16.130 --> 02:17.298
Aw, man.

02:17.331 --> 02:18.399
I'm sure it'll be back.

02:18.432 --> 02:19.466
You think?

02:19.499 --> 02:21.401
That would be so thoughtful.

02:21.435 --> 02:23.103
Hey, uh...You...

02:23.136 --> 02:24.538
You like football, right?

02:24.571 --> 02:25.972
You're a big football man.

02:26.006 --> 02:26.873
No. Actually, I don't

02:26.907 --> 02:28.408
like sports in general.

02:28.441 --> 02:29.409
But, I mean, you like

02:29.442 --> 02:30.376
jerseys, right?

02:30.410 --> 02:32.177
'Cause I got some Giants-wear.

02:32.211 --> 02:33.278
Super-cheap, too.

02:33.312 --> 02:34.513
Active-wear. It's for

02:34.546 --> 02:36.581
the total, ultimate fan.

02:36.615 --> 02:37.649
Check it out.

02:37.682 --> 02:38.650
Carl, I really don't--

02:38.683 --> 02:39.984
bad! Don't worry

02:40.018 --> 02:40.985
about this rip.

02:41.019 --> 02:42.453
I just accidentally ripped it

02:42.487 --> 02:44.122
pulling it out of the box.

02:44.155 --> 02:45.156
Are the Gnats a team?

02:45.189 --> 02:47.958
No. Gnats? What the fan?

02:47.991 --> 02:49.693
It's supposed to be the Giants!

02:49.727 --> 02:51.294
I friggin' told them immigrants!

02:51.328 --> 02:53.263
No wonder they cut me a deal.

02:53.296 --> 02:54.431
What a deal!

02:54.464 --> 02:55.932
They probably don't even have

02:55.965 --> 02:57.033
giants in their country,

02:57.066 --> 02:58.435
they're so friggin' tiny.

02:58.468 --> 02:59.602
Look at this crap.

02:59.636 --> 03:00.570
Half of them dissolved

03:00.603 --> 03:01.704
in the box.

03:01.738 --> 03:02.544
Well, you know what they say.

03:02.578 --> 03:03.679
You get what you pay for.

03:03.712 --> 03:04.613
I'll tell you what.

03:04.646 --> 03:06.515
How about I take 20% off?

03:06.548 --> 03:07.383
How about no?

03:07.416 --> 03:08.484
Oh, come on, man. I seen you

03:08.517 --> 03:09.918
flying around so fast,

03:09.951 --> 03:11.452
people won't even notice.

03:11.486 --> 03:13.121
Right? High five, football fan.

03:13.154 --> 03:14.054
I really don't like

03:14.089 --> 03:14.989
sports, Carl.

03:15.022 --> 03:18.492
Oh, yeah? Well, you're a fag!

03:18.525 --> 03:19.693
Look, it's the third house

03:19.727 --> 03:20.861
on the right.

03:20.895 --> 03:23.597
Just...Feel free to crash there.

03:23.630 --> 03:24.364
I'm going to go on in here

03:24.398 --> 03:25.599
and take me a poop.

03:25.632 --> 03:26.332
Yeah.

03:26.365 --> 03:27.366
That would be cool, man.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.167
That would be cool.

03:28.201 --> 03:29.102
There's a big computer

03:29.135 --> 03:30.269
in there. You like the internet?

03:30.303 --> 03:31.304
Use all you want.

03:31.337 --> 03:32.338
My pants are all wet.

03:32.371 --> 03:33.472
Oh, very important--

03:33.506 --> 03:34.407
security code.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.340
We ain't got none.

03:35.373 --> 03:36.608
So just go right in.

03:36.642 --> 03:38.710
My pants is stuck to my butt.

03:38.743 --> 03:39.744
When is Frylock getting here?

03:39.777 --> 03:40.645
I don't know,

03:40.678 --> 03:42.113
but I'm pissed about it.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.722
Get up, Carl.

03:51.755 --> 03:53.389
Wh-wh-what?

03:53.423 --> 03:55.591
You're Bart Oates, the center

03:55.625 --> 03:57.760
for the Super Bowl Giants!

03:57.793 --> 03:59.929
'87 and '91!

03:59.962 --> 04:01.564
The G-men! Yeah!

04:01.597 --> 04:03.438
Take the TV. Take whatever

04:03.472 --> 04:05.074
you need to get by.

04:05.107 --> 04:05.907
What are you talking about?

04:05.940 --> 04:07.142
I don't need your money, Carl.

04:07.176 --> 04:08.343
Let me tell you.

04:08.377 --> 04:10.745
January 27, 1991...

04:10.779 --> 04:13.314
Best friggin' day of my life.

04:13.347 --> 04:15.216
Norwood missing wide.

04:15.249 --> 04:16.284
Friggin' Tuna coaching

04:16.317 --> 04:17.351
on the sideline.

04:17.385 --> 04:19.519
You, like...Hiking the ball.

04:19.553 --> 04:21.053
You know? Did you

04:21.088 --> 04:22.422
come here to kill me?

04:22.455 --> 04:23.223
No, Carl.

04:23.256 --> 04:24.424
Oh, that's so great.

04:24.457 --> 04:25.458
The Gnats?

04:25.492 --> 04:27.159
What is this, Carl?

04:27.193 --> 04:29.095
Oh, that? It's, uh...

04:29.128 --> 04:30.396
Well, it's just a...

04:30.429 --> 04:33.499
It's a tribute to your majesty.

04:33.532 --> 04:34.333
Carl, by doing this,

04:34.366 --> 04:35.334
you're taking food out

04:35.367 --> 04:36.968
of N.F.L. Players' mouths.

04:37.001 --> 04:38.737
I'm so sorry, Bart.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.771
But, dude, I followed your whole

04:40.804 --> 04:42.440
Pro-Bowl season in '90.

04:42.473 --> 04:44.108
You had a sack-prevented index.

04:44.141 --> 04:45.643
It's, like, point-9.

04:45.676 --> 04:46.376
It's ridiculous!

04:46.410 --> 04:48.578
Your blocking ratio was 4 to 1.

04:48.612 --> 04:49.646
You were playing out of your

04:49.679 --> 04:51.014
mind that season!

04:51.047 --> 04:53.016
And then 1994.

04:53.049 --> 04:54.050
You friggin' signed

04:54.083 --> 04:55.284
with the Niners.

04:55.318 --> 04:56.485
You broke my friggin' heart,

04:56.519 --> 04:58.787
Bart. You pancaked it!

04:58.821 --> 04:59.688
I was there when you

04:59.722 --> 05:00.856
destroyed my poster.

05:00.889 --> 05:02.097
And you said, "i hope

05:02.130 --> 05:03.499
he gets injured."

05:03.532 --> 05:05.500
Enjoy San Francisco, pansy.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.202
I hope you tear

05:07.235 --> 05:10.438
your A.C.L., jack-ass!

05:10.472 --> 05:12.073
I said that?

05:12.106 --> 05:12.974
3 years later,

05:13.007 --> 05:14.275
I had knee surgery,

05:14.308 --> 05:16.043
and I had to retire, Carl.

05:16.077 --> 05:19.313
So I made you have, like,

05:19.346 --> 05:21.314
knee surgery by saying that?

05:21.347 --> 05:23.884
In a way, yes, you did.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.151
That's awesome.

05:25.185 --> 05:27.820
I mean, I'm sorry in retrospect,

05:27.853 --> 05:29.789
but that's so awesome

05:29.822 --> 05:31.356
I was able to do that.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.592
I hate the Niners!

05:33.625 --> 05:34.959
So, Carl, I want you to do

05:34.993 --> 05:36.261
something for me.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.362
You want some Gnats t-shirts

05:37.396 --> 05:38.597
for your family?

05:38.630 --> 05:39.731
I'll cut you a deal.

05:39.764 --> 05:41.232
We'll go 40% off on those.

05:41.265 --> 05:42.266
Hey, Carl, do you want

05:42.300 --> 05:43.234
to be a winner?

05:43.267 --> 05:43.967
You got to lay off

05:44.001 --> 05:44.935
the salty foods.

05:44.968 --> 05:46.069
Don't drink so much.

05:46.103 --> 05:47.437
Try some exercise.

05:47.471 --> 05:48.706
Maybe go out with a woman

05:48.739 --> 05:50.207
you didn't have to pay.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.308
You know, sex isn't everything.

05:51.341 --> 05:52.909
Neither is the band Boston.

05:52.942 --> 05:53.710
If you want to be a champ,

05:53.743 --> 05:55.344
you got to pay the price, man.

05:55.378 --> 05:56.746
You got to go all the way.

05:56.779 --> 05:57.780
Listen to what I'm

05:57.814 --> 05:58.714
telling you, Carl.

05:58.748 --> 06:00.716
Listen to what I'm telling you.

06:00.749 --> 06:01.850
Wait, Bart Oates. Wait.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.091
I got so many more stats

06:03.124 --> 06:05.326
I want to throw at you.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.364
He's gone.

06:09.397 --> 06:11.666
I'm so hung-over.

06:11.699 --> 06:13.267
Did you see me pounding those

06:13.300 --> 06:15.635
daiquiris at the bar last night?

06:15.670 --> 06:17.137
I was a maniac!

06:17.171 --> 06:18.438
What was I thinking?

06:18.472 --> 06:19.573
You pounded one.

06:19.606 --> 06:20.707
Well, I pound

06:20.740 --> 06:22.208
what I can afford.

06:22.241 --> 06:23.442
Hey, my man over here,

06:23.476 --> 06:25.078
he wants a daiquiri now.

06:25.111 --> 06:26.379
He says I got to smuggle

06:26.412 --> 06:28.714
one back in, up my butt hole.

06:28.747 --> 06:30.849
Oh. Fresh or the mix?

06:30.883 --> 06:31.717
Fresh.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.218
Oh, God. That would

06:33.251 --> 06:34.853
be so cold.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.727
One.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.329
All right. Take a break.

06:45.362 --> 06:46.563
Whoa. You just burned

06:46.597 --> 06:48.131
a third of a gram of fat, man.

06:48.164 --> 06:49.132
That's good, right.

06:49.165 --> 06:50.166
Yeah, that's good.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.234
Not good enough.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.635
You need to do more laps.

06:52.668 --> 06:53.736
And try not touching the bottom

06:53.769 --> 06:55.171
of the pool so much.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.906
How did you know?

06:56.939 --> 06:59.441
Carl, I know everything.

06:59.474 --> 07:00.910
Hey, Carl, what's up?

07:00.943 --> 07:02.184
Oh, crap. Hide.

07:02.217 --> 07:03.118
Hide? From what?

07:03.152 --> 07:03.952
From, uh...

07:03.985 --> 07:05.487
just play it off as a joke.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.689
From, uh...You know...

07:07.722 --> 07:08.890
Black people have been

07:08.923 --> 07:10.358
running around here.

07:10.391 --> 07:11.892
That's not really

07:11.925 --> 07:13.227
a joke, Carl.

07:13.261 --> 07:14.495
Come on, man. I'm trying.

07:14.528 --> 07:15.428
Ok, Carl, look. I felt

07:15.463 --> 07:16.597
really bad about your car,

07:16.630 --> 07:17.430
so I brought you some fresh

07:17.464 --> 07:18.598
Parsley and Oregano

07:18.631 --> 07:19.732
from my herb garden.

07:19.766 --> 07:21.000
Oh, great. Weeds.

07:21.033 --> 07:22.168
This will help me get

07:22.201 --> 07:23.436
to the strip club.

07:23.470 --> 07:24.837
Where's my friggin' car?

07:24.871 --> 07:26.005
Well, it's kind of

07:26.038 --> 07:26.906
been impounded.

07:26.939 --> 07:28.240
What? You tell me right now,

07:28.274 --> 07:29.441
Fry Man, where my friggin'

07:29.475 --> 07:30.709
car is, or I'm gonna rip that

07:30.742 --> 07:32.478
paper-box head of yours in half!

07:32.511 --> 07:33.645
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, Carl.

07:33.679 --> 07:34.813
You don't want a penalty

07:34.846 --> 07:36.081
for roughing the neighbor.

07:36.114 --> 07:37.115
I mean, that's 15 yards,

07:37.148 --> 07:38.383
and that hurts the team.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.817
Whoa, whoa. Hey, Carl.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.251
It's ok. It's ok.

07:41.285 --> 07:42.887
I'm not mad. Ok?

07:42.920 --> 07:45.822
So, where's my effing car?

07:45.855 --> 07:47.824
Please, sir.

07:47.857 --> 07:50.627
Carl. Well, well, well.

07:50.660 --> 07:53.229
Look who's off to the slammer.

07:53.262 --> 07:54.630
I bailed you out, dumb-ass.

07:54.663 --> 07:56.031
Oh. Well, good.

07:56.065 --> 07:56.965
I'm driving. Let's go.

07:56.999 --> 07:57.933
I'm driving.

07:57.966 --> 07:59.067
No! You have no control

07:59.101 --> 08:00.435
of your bladder.

08:02.210 --> 08:02.878
Hey, Carl, what

08:02.911 --> 08:03.578
are you doing?

08:03.611 --> 08:04.412
You got to go back.

08:04.446 --> 08:05.280
That's not right.

08:05.313 --> 08:06.113
You are trying

08:06.147 --> 08:07.382
my patience, Bart Oates.

08:07.415 --> 08:08.916
What do you want from me?

08:08.950 --> 08:12.253
Look...I'm so sorry.

08:12.286 --> 08:15.155
I'm sorry that you tried

08:15.188 --> 08:17.223
to walk in front of me when I

08:17.257 --> 08:19.793
clearly had the right of way.

08:19.826 --> 08:21.027
Hey, Carl, you know, that's

08:21.061 --> 08:22.428
not really the spirit of this.

08:22.462 --> 08:23.363
All right, all right,

08:23.396 --> 08:25.097
all right, look. Reset.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.032
I am very glad that forensics

08:27.066 --> 08:28.433
could not match the paint

08:28.467 --> 08:30.069
on your face to the paint

08:30.102 --> 08:32.504
on my fender, but I am sorry

08:32.537 --> 08:34.038
that you had to pay

08:34.072 --> 08:35.306
the ultimate price

08:35.339 --> 08:36.674
for not looking both ways.

08:36.707 --> 08:38.376
I did not wave you on.

08:38.409 --> 08:39.809
I was flipping you off!

08:39.842 --> 08:40.578
Carl.

08:40.611 --> 08:41.645
Ok. All right.

08:41.679 --> 08:44.181
I'm sorry you're dead.

08:44.214 --> 08:45.082
You're in the red zone

08:45.115 --> 08:45.916
now, buddy.

08:45.949 --> 08:46.850
You got to close the deal.

08:46.884 --> 08:47.985
But me answering questions

08:48.018 --> 08:49.752
to a bunch of cops wasn't ever

08:49.786 --> 08:50.987
going to bring you back.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.188
Be a champ. Go all the way.

08:52.221 --> 08:52.989
Ok! I'm sorry

08:53.022 --> 08:54.390
I hit you, all right?!

08:54.423 --> 08:55.157
And that's as sorry

08:55.191 --> 08:56.358
as I'm ever going to be.

08:56.392 --> 08:57.926
You were old. I could tell.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.362
Ok, guys, look. I'm sorry

09:00.396 --> 09:02.237
that I made an assload of money

09:02.270 --> 09:04.205
selling these in the parking lot

09:04.239 --> 09:05.140
of your show.

09:05.173 --> 09:06.041
They ain't supposed to

09:06.074 --> 09:07.208
say Chicano.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.476
It was them dumb-ass immigrants

09:08.509 --> 09:10.210
I had working for me.

09:10.244 --> 09:11.145
Anyways, I want you

09:11.178 --> 09:12.512
to have this.

09:12.546 --> 09:14.648
20% off on these.

09:14.681 --> 09:15.582
Hey, Carl, you're

09:15.615 --> 09:16.583
offsides, buddy.

09:16.616 --> 09:17.317
All right, look.

09:17.351 --> 09:19.218
Here's the money I made on it.

09:19.252 --> 09:20.619
$40 in change?

09:20.654 --> 09:22.288
Damn it. You know everything.

09:22.321 --> 09:24.757
All right, look. I'll make out

09:24.790 --> 09:26.925
a check to...How about

09:26.959 --> 09:28.661
I make it out to Chicago?

09:28.694 --> 09:32.230
All right! Friggin' cash! Fine!

09:32.264 --> 09:33.631
Who was that?

09:33.665 --> 09:34.432
I don't know,

09:34.466 --> 09:35.633
but check it out--

09:35.667 --> 09:37.769
$43 in change. All right.

09:40.171 --> 09:41.838
I don't recognize

09:41.872 --> 09:43.006
this place.

09:43.039 --> 09:44.341
Carl, huddle up.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.441
This is Linda Hamilton's house.

09:45.476 --> 09:47.143
She is destined to play Sarah

09:47.177 --> 09:49.212
Connor in "The Terminator."

09:49.245 --> 09:50.280
And Sarah will give birth

09:50.313 --> 09:51.681
to John, and he will lead

09:51.714 --> 09:53.015
the resistance to the rise

09:53.048 --> 09:54.517
against the machines.

09:54.550 --> 09:55.918
Well, I mean, she's already

09:55.951 --> 09:57.419
been in that movie.

09:57.452 --> 09:58.520
Well, I've been sent

09:58.553 --> 10:00.021
by the machines to get you

10:00.054 --> 10:01.390
to kill Linda Hamilton.

10:01.423 --> 10:02.196
What are you talking

10:02.230 --> 10:03.264
about, man?

10:03.297 --> 10:04.198
She's an actress.

10:04.232 --> 10:05.033
Come on, Carl.

10:05.066 --> 10:05.934
You got to do it, brother.

10:05.967 --> 10:07.068
You got to go all the way.

10:07.101 --> 10:08.636
Do it for Tuna. Do it for L.T.

10:08.669 --> 10:10.137
Come on, man. This is our house.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.572
This is Linda's house.

10:11.605 --> 10:12.773
We got to run a trap,

10:12.806 --> 10:13.606
and you've got to lay

10:13.640 --> 10:14.707
a big hurt on Linda.

10:14.741 --> 10:15.675
Lay a big hurt on...

10:15.708 --> 10:16.743
Listen to yourself.

10:16.776 --> 10:17.944
She's an actress!

10:17.977 --> 10:19.045
It was a movie!

10:19.078 --> 10:20.412
This is friggin' stupid!

10:20.447 --> 10:21.547
Stupid? Are you kidding me?

10:21.581 --> 10:22.614
Listen, man. When I had

10:22.648 --> 10:23.782
my knee surgery, the computers

10:23.816 --> 10:25.051
replaced all my parts

10:25.084 --> 10:26.452
with metal machinery.

10:26.485 --> 10:28.754
You want to see?

10:28.787 --> 10:29.888
Looks like they did it

10:29.921 --> 10:31.289
on a budget. I don't see

10:31.322 --> 10:32.523
any computers in there.

10:32.557 --> 10:33.591
What?

10:33.624 --> 10:34.825
A lot of cans here.

10:34.859 --> 10:35.793
Oh, man! The computers

10:35.826 --> 10:36.861
lied to me.

10:36.894 --> 10:37.762
Oh, you think?

10:37.795 --> 10:38.896
Oh, no! My whole life

10:38.929 --> 10:40.164
is a sham!

10:41.131 --> 10:41.798
Intruders.

10:41.831 --> 10:42.732
All right, drama queen.

10:42.766 --> 10:43.733
Let's get out of here

10:43.767 --> 10:45.402
before Linda wakes up.

10:45.435 --> 10:47.036
Whoa. What the hell is that?

10:47.070 --> 10:48.271
It's a B.B. It was lodged

10:48.304 --> 10:49.472
in his frontal lobe.

10:49.505 --> 10:50.573
But how did he get

10:50.606 --> 10:52.308
a B.B. In his brain?

10:52.341 --> 10:53.476
Milkshake, we're in

10:53.509 --> 10:54.743
the goal-line offense, baby.

10:54.777 --> 10:55.744
You've got to score.

10:55.778 --> 10:56.812
You're a champ, buddy.

10:56.845 --> 10:58.313
Go all the way.

11:00.448 --> 11:01.449
I don't know.

11:01.483 --> 11:02.357
I need to figure out how to

11:02.390 --> 11:03.558
shove a daiquiri up my butt.

11:03.591 --> 11:05.492
? Dancing is forbidden

11:05.526 --> 11:08.295
d-d-dancing is forbidden

11:08.329 --> 11:10.931
dancing is forbidden

11:10.964 --> 11:13.967
d-d-dancing is forbidden

11:14.000 --> 11:16.837
dancing is forbidden ?
