00:14.948 --> 00:16.281
<i>[Joe] It was just...</i>

00:16.283 --> 00:18.884
you know, it was
perfect timing, actually.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.986
<i>[narrator] But their

00:33.933 --> 00:34.933
- [eerie growling]
- Dan!

00:34.935 --> 00:36.835

01:44.071 --> 01:46.905
<i>[Joe] I just really needed

care about and...

01:48.008 --> 01:50.142
who just brought some
levity into my life.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.244
I'd gone through
so much for so long,

01:52.246 --> 01:55.481

perfect timing actually.

luck and near-fatal work injuries,</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:07.826
[Danika] Hey, Joey.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.962
You got that box?
That's the heavy one.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.998
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good,
it's good. I got it. [chuckles]

02:13.233 --> 02:14.967
I love this house.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.869
Okay.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.605
-All right. I love you. Get the door though.
-[both chuckle]

02:19.607 --> 02:21.006
In a hurry, over here.

02:21.008 --> 02:24.409
<i>[Joe] By the time Danika
and I met back later in life,</i>

02:24.411 --> 02:27.446
we had both gone
through divorces.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.748
And when we found
each other, it was...

02:29.750 --> 02:32.751
it was kind of funny, we picked
right back up where we left off.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.954
<i>[narrator] The couple settle
into their new home.</i>

02:35.956 --> 02:38.757

02:38.759 --> 02:40.392
Uh, yeah, I'm...

02:40.394 --> 02:41.793
trying to make the
place look perfect

02:41.795 --> 02:44.763
and I'm not sure this
is gonna have a place.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.298
I went three for four
on that game.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.002
We'll figure it out.

02:56.809 --> 02:59.211
Look Joe, it's your Pop!

03:00.213 --> 03:02.014
He's so handsome.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.385
I love a man in uniform.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.922
My husband became
a police officer

03:09.924 --> 03:12.191
because his father was
a police officer and...

03:12.193 --> 03:13.025
it's all he knew.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.960
And I think that
it was something that

03:14.962 --> 03:17.296
made his father
pretty proud of him.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.200
You ever miss the job, babe?

03:22.235 --> 03:24.937
I had some very serious
injuries. I was almost killed.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.372
I actually looked down the barrel
of the gun and watched it go off.

03:28.875 --> 03:29.575
Sometimes you gotta...

03:29.577 --> 03:31.977
take the hint and move on, no?

03:37.684 --> 03:41.853
<i>[narrator] Not long after
Joe and Danika move in,</i>

03:41.855 --> 03:45.958
<i>they begin to feel they're not
the only ones living there.</i>

03:50.563 --> 03:51.997
Hon!

03:51.999 --> 03:55.400
I understand about a lot of
complicated things, but this?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.336
I got it, I got it, I got it.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.008
You press this button
on that remote, right?

04:03.910 --> 04:07.446
Then you press the up
arrow on this one.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.116
Then you press the up
arrow on this one.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.919
Then the center button
after you scroll down,

04:13.953 --> 04:15.754
and over,

04:15.756 --> 04:18.257
press select.
It auto-signs you in.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.025
It's nothing to it.

04:20.693 --> 04:21.827
Joe.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.728
<i>[Joe] Danika and I...</i>

04:22.730 --> 04:23.762

04:23.764 --> 04:25.897
I don't even want
to call them arguments.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.432
Some of them were but
some of them were like,

04:27.434 --> 04:29.835
two people who are best friends,
who have known each other a long time,

04:29.837 --> 04:32.537
who can kind of yell
at each other and not mean it.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.439
What do you want from me?
Look, you want to watch your shows,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.908
I got you the manner
by which to watch your shows.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.977
You used to have 18 remotes,
I got it down to three.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.878
Are you kidding me right now?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.346
[loud banging]

04:43.416 --> 04:44.516
<i>[Joe] Out of the blue,</i>

04:44.518 --> 04:46.718
<i>on the wall of the
room we were in.</i>

04:46.720 --> 04:48.687
Enough where it kind of,
shook the room.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.189
Three very loud bangs, like...

04:51.191 --> 04:55.227
like a grown man was taking
his fist and punching the wall.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.296
What was that?

05:02.835 --> 05:03.935
[Joe] I don't know, baby.

05:06.873 --> 05:07.973
I'm gonna go find out.
You stay here.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.241
Okay.

05:19.686 --> 05:20.786
<i>[Joe] I tried to figure out</i>

05:20.788 --> 05:23.155
what exactly was happening.

05:23.157 --> 05:26.091
And I actually walked
around a little bit.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.674
[banging on wall]

05:42.676 --> 05:44.876
And right then,

05:44.878 --> 05:47.145
three bangs happened
again on the wall,

05:47.147 --> 05:49.114
right in front of my face.

05:51.784 --> 05:52.751
Sake.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.453
<i>[Joe] I actually felt</i>

05:54.455 --> 05:56.755
<i>the wind of what...</i>

05:56.757 --> 05:58.657
<i>if a human being was
standing in front of you,</i>

05:58.659 --> 06:00.192
<i>hitting the wall,</i>

06:00.194 --> 06:02.494
you'd sense their arm moving,
and feel that wind.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.862
That's what I felt.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.365
<i>And it really scared
me half to death.</i>

06:20.913 --> 06:22.381
- Joe.
- [Joe screams]

06:23.015 --> 06:24.216
Baby!

06:24.951 --> 06:26.118
What was it, Joe?

06:26.686 --> 06:27.686
I don't know, baby but...

06:27.688 --> 06:29.821
you scared the crap out of me.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.790
I was scared [bleep] less.
I didn't know what to do.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.992
Geez.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.296
Oh, baby, baby. Behind me.
Behind me. Behind me.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.411
[Joe] I don't know.

06:52.678 --> 06:53.612
I don't know.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.849
Joe, do you think
it's your dad trying to...

06:57.851 --> 07:00.051
get in touch with you,
trying to get your attention?

07:00.653 --> 07:01.420
Babe,

07:01.854 --> 07:03.154
Dad's been dead for years.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.689
- What do you mean, get my attention? That's crazy.
- I don't know

07:04.691 --> 07:07.726
but I don't understand,
there's any other explanation.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.729
<i>[Joe] And that was when we
kind of realized that something...</i>

07:10.731 --> 07:11.930
<i>that was happening
there that we...</i>

07:11.932 --> 07:13.398
<i>we were out of control of.</i>

07:13.400 --> 07:15.167
We were both pretty terrified.

- [footsteps approaching]

Babe!

07:38.758 --> 07:39.825
<i>I heard two or three...</i>

07:39.827 --> 07:41.159
distinct footsteps

07:41.161 --> 07:43.895
of what sounded like
a grown man walk up

07:43.897 --> 07:45.397
to the side of my bed.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.232
And I can feel...

07:48.134 --> 07:50.368
something or someone
standing there.

07:52.171 --> 07:53.338
Babe.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.312
Dan.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.015

You're not gonna wake up.

Dan!

08:10.991 --> 08:11.857
Wake up!

08:11.859 --> 08:14.926

08:14.928 --> 08:17.462
- Wake up!
- What? What... what--

08:17.464 --> 08:18.930
The hell is wrong with you?

08:18.932 --> 08:21.299
There was somebody
watching me, then you were...

08:21.601 --> 08:23.935
- talking like a zombie.
- What?

08:23.937 --> 08:26.137
Yeah, like you were possessed
or whatever. There was a...

08:27.975 --> 08:29.407
just staring at me.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.542
The foot of the bed, there.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.410
What are you talking about, Joe?

08:32.412 --> 08:34.379
<i>[Danika] Really, I thought
that he was... he was nuts.</i>

<i>I'm talking and I don't
know I'm talking,</i>

08:36.817 --> 08:40.018
and he's sensing something at
the same time that I'm talking?

08:40.419 --> 08:42.954
It's... it's just
not believable.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.124
- Your voice, it was like a deep growl.
- Joe...

08:48.027 --> 08:48.894
You really don't remember?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.195
No, Joe.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.098
Maybe it was just a nightmare.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.434
But I'm up now.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.037
Gonna go get a glass of water.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.188
Look, this is what I got.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.357
I think we need
to use this thing.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.893
<i>[Joe] We get to a point where</i>

25:28.895 --> 25:31.829
<i>we were gonna try anything
to see what's up.</i>

25:31.831 --> 25:34.064
We decided this was
something we were gonna do.

25:42.941 --> 25:45.409
Is there someone in this house

25:45.411 --> 25:47.344
who's trying to get
our attention?

25:51.182 --> 25:52.349
[Joe] Yes.

25:57.022 --> 25:58.188
Do we know you?

26:02.961 --> 26:03.961
Are you related?

26:11.202 --> 26:12.303
No.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.807
What is it?

26:16.809 --> 26:18.275
- What? What?
- Baby?

26:18.944 --> 26:20.077
Baby, I...

26:20.144 --> 26:21.812
feel hands

26:21.879 --> 26:23.647
- on my shoulders.
- No.

26:23.649 --> 26:26.116
No, this can't be.
Joe, I don't see anyone.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.218
Yeah, baby. I'm telling
you, I feel it.

26:31.289 --> 26:32.389
Who are you?

26:38.563 --> 26:39.496
A...

26:40.899 --> 26:42.199
- Baby, you doing this?
- [Danika] Mmm-mmm.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.168
Z...

26:48.807 --> 26:49.974
E...

26:52.944 --> 26:54.278
[Danika] Who's Z?

26:55.981 --> 26:56.981
[Danika whimpers]

26:58.216 --> 26:59.249
E.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.155
L.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.391
Azazel?

27:07.993 --> 27:08.892
Well, what the hell is that?

27:08.894 --> 27:10.661
What? Is it a name?

27:10.663 --> 27:13.063
Azazel? I don't
frickin' know, baby.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.767
What? What's that on your leg?

27:16.769 --> 27:18.636
Joe! What's on your leg?

27:18.638 --> 27:21.038
- Oh, my God, Joe!
- Oh!

27:21.973 --> 27:24.808
<i>[narrator] Joe and Danika
Menano have taken a chance</i>

<i>they believe is
haunting their home.</i>

27:32.017 --> 27:33.317
[Joe screams]

27:33.985 --> 27:35.953
What is that on your leg?

27:35.955 --> 27:40.858
<i>But the message it had
is seared into Joe's skin.</i>

27:40.860 --> 27:42.893
Oh, my God, Joe,
what is that on your leg?

27:42.895 --> 27:43.560
-Baby,
-What?

27:43.562 --> 27:44.962
What happened? What?

27:44.964 --> 27:46.830
Don't even worry about it.
Don't even worry about it.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.232
What the hell is Azazel?

27:50.135 --> 27:51.168
[Joe groans]

27:53.872 --> 27:54.872
Uh...

27:54.939 --> 27:56.273
Azazel.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.044
Biblical demon with yellow eyes.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.314
Biblical demon with yellow eyes?

28:06.751 --> 28:09.420
<i>[Joe] Where have I been that
something this old or evil</i>

28:09.422 --> 28:11.588
<i>could be attached
to me or my house?</i>

28:11.590 --> 28:13.757
You know, I'm just a regular
guy from Rhode Island.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.859
Like, why would this
thing be in my house?

28:15.861 --> 28:17.161
Uh, I mean...

28:17.163 --> 28:19.229
It's obviously
something intelligent.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.430
It's uh...

28:20.432 --> 28:22.966
paying attention to everything
that's going on.

28:24.135 --> 28:27.237
I never had anything like this
happen to me until I met you, Joe.

28:29.574 --> 28:30.974
[dramatic music playing]

28:31.609 --> 28:34.845
<i>[narrator] Realizing
they need extra help,</i>

28:34.847 --> 28:38.849
<i>Joe contacts renowned
demonologist, Carl L. Johnson</i>

28:38.851 --> 28:39.550
<i>and his associate,</i>

28:39.552 --> 28:41.418
<i>Elise Carlson.</i>

28:42.987 --> 28:46.790
<i>[Carl] I'm a paranormal researcher
who specializes as a demonologist.</i>

28:46.792 --> 28:49.493
I define demonology as,

28:49.495 --> 28:51.829
the systematic study
of the lore,

28:51.831 --> 28:54.698
and cultural traditions
of wicked spirits.

28:54.700 --> 28:58.535
<i>[narrator] Johnson began his
paranormal career decades earlier.</i>

28:58.537 --> 29:00.904
<i>Investigating the
Perron family haunting</i>

29:00.906 --> 29:02.906
<i>in nearby Harrisville,
Rhode Island.</i>

29:02.908 --> 29:04.108
<i>That case...</i>

29:04.110 --> 29:07.244
<i>inspired the first
Conjuring movie.</i>

29:09.814 --> 29:11.381
You know, Joe started
out when he called saying,

29:11.383 --> 29:13.117
"I hope you won't
think I'm crazy."

29:15.153 --> 29:16.186
Interesting.

29:17.188 --> 29:18.255
Ready?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.023
Let's do it.

29:23.695 --> 29:26.163
<i>[Carl] Elise and I
work very well together.</i>

29:26.798 --> 29:29.399
She has a background
in law enforcement

29:29.401 --> 29:31.335
and investigative procedure.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.676
I'm Danika, Joe's wife.

29:39.678 --> 29:41.411
- We're really glad you came.
- Yeah.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.413
I'm Carl. This is
my colleague, Elise.

29:44.415 --> 29:46.283
Joe's been making
a lot of recordings.

29:47.852 --> 29:49.887
We're just gonna talk
for a bit right now.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.388
Gather some information.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.423
All right? So, Joe...

29:53.425 --> 29:56.693
tell us what you believe these
voices have been saying to you.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.595
Uh, do you mind if
we record the conversation?

29:58.597 --> 30:01.098
So I don't miss anything.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.667
<i>[Danika] I think that they came
just to make sure that we're not crazy.</i>

30:03.669 --> 30:05.569
And honestly,

30:05.571 --> 30:08.906
I kind of wanted to make sure
that my husband wasn't crazy.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.575
<i>[narrator] Carl and Elise
listen intently</i>

30:11.577 --> 30:14.812
<i>as Joe and Danika describe
what's been happening.</i>

30:14.814 --> 30:17.848
<i>[Elise] We learned
a little bit more about Joe.</i>

30:17.850 --> 30:21.118
That he had been through
a very traumatic experience.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.420
You were grazed by a bullet
over your ear, in the line of duty?

30:24.088 --> 30:25.122
Yes.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.424
Yeah.

30:28.726 --> 30:30.427
Thought I was going
to meet my maker.

30:32.797 --> 30:35.232
That's when we started hearing
the voices in the house.

30:42.707 --> 30:44.408
It's telling me
some horrible things.

30:46.711 --> 30:48.111
Telling me I'm worthless.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.282
That I should off myself.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.320
They're trying to break us up.

30:58.790 --> 30:59.857
I see.

30:59.859 --> 31:03.026
<i>[Carl] I thought there was
no ghost haunting Joe.</i>

31:03.028 --> 31:05.028
<i>Oh, there were strange things
happening in the house,</i>

31:05.030 --> 31:06.997
<i>but his main problem</i>

31:06.999 --> 31:09.867
I thought was rooted
in his psyche.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.936
A manifestation of his own
thoughts, his own mind,

31:12.938 --> 31:14.304
his own conscience.

31:14.906 --> 31:16.039
Ah, but, uh...

31:16.708 --> 31:18.075
but maybe, uh...

31:18.743 --> 31:20.911
maybe the most
disturbing thing is uh,

31:20.945 --> 31:22.379
this writing on the...

31:23.381 --> 31:25.082
on the steamed up
bathroom mirror.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.986
That's fascinating, Joe.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.088
Just fascinating.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.991
[Elise] Interesting scripts.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.095
Do you mind if we just
have a look around?

31:40.031 --> 31:40.697
Sure.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.366
Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.640
<i>[Elise] So, Carl and I looked
around the house to...</i>

31:49.642 --> 31:50.874
<i>find handwriting samples</i>

31:50.876 --> 31:52.609
<i>without alerting the homeowners</i>

31:52.611 --> 31:54.411
<i>because we didn't want
to make them feel</i>

31:54.413 --> 31:56.246
like we were calling
them out on it.

32:04.389 --> 32:05.656
<i>We wanted to match up</i>

32:06.024 --> 32:08.258
who could have possibly
written those words on the mirror.

32:09.794 --> 32:10.961
Interesting.

32:11.930 --> 32:12.763
What did you find?

32:12.797 --> 32:14.431
Well...

32:14.433 --> 32:17.234
you see how the A's and E's
are written on that mirror?

32:18.202 --> 32:20.971
I don't know anyone who writes
an A or an E like that.

32:21.339 --> 32:22.406
Agreed.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.777
These are written by
a number of different people.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.112
None of them match the
writing on that shower mirror.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.249
Yeah, none match
here in the mail either.

32:33.217 --> 32:35.118
Now this is getting
interesting, isn't it?

32:36.788 --> 32:37.621
Hmm.

32:39.390 --> 32:42.125
I just want to rule
out a few things.

32:43.828 --> 32:46.930
Rule out any possible
anomalies or...

32:46.932 --> 32:50.033
Yeah, or debunk any
paranormal causes. Look,

32:50.902 --> 32:51.635
steady readings.

32:51.702 --> 32:53.236
Oh.

32:53.238 --> 32:56.139
Oh. Right here is where
Danika said she was scratched.

33:03.381 --> 33:06.550
Yeah, but you see, there's nothing
in the red here, even the orange.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.886
I mean, there's nothing
unexplainable here except maybe...

33:09.888 --> 33:11.955
maybe the microwave
is leaking a bit.

33:12.890 --> 33:15.792
<i>[Carl] I did not attribute it
to anything paranormal.</i>

33:15.794 --> 33:18.862
So, that's how
I would have logged it,

33:18.864 --> 33:21.231
had not other information
come to light.

33:29.774 --> 33:30.407
[Elise] Thanks.

33:30.409 --> 33:31.375
[clears throat]

33:31.743 --> 33:33.810
Well, Carl, Elise...

33:33.812 --> 33:35.312
there's something
I want you to hear.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.848
I think we've got enough
information right now

33:37.850 --> 33:39.116
for our initial investigation.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.251
We'll check our notes
and get back to you, okay?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.553
Well, you see...

33:43.555 --> 33:45.155
there's a spirit and...

33:45.157 --> 33:48.225
he told us his name was Azazel
through the spirit board.

33:48.559 --> 33:50.827
Joe, it's okay.

33:50.829 --> 33:54.131
A real demon wouldn't
give its name like that.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.366
We're gonna gather our notes and
thoughts and we'll get back to you.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.767
Okay?

34:00.138 --> 34:01.771
<i>[narrator] Back at their office,</i>

34:01.773 --> 34:06.777
<i>Elise begins reviewing the recording
they made at the Menano interview.</i>

34:06.779 --> 34:11.081
Subject believes he is being
targeted by a negative entity.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.019
[audio static]

34:18.056 --> 34:20.157
[faint whispering]

34:30.601 --> 34:32.903
[audio static]

34:32.905 --> 34:33.970
[whispering] I'm
going to kill you.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.439
Ca-- Carl!

34:35.973 --> 34:37.174
Come in here.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.944
What's going on?

34:40.946 --> 34:44.281
I'm transcribing the notes from the
conversation over at the Menanos.

34:44.982 --> 34:47.117
I can hear someone...

34:47.119 --> 34:48.852
it sounds like someone inhaling.

34:48.854 --> 34:49.753
Like,

34:49.755 --> 34:51.054
about to speak.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.490
Like, a deep voice whisper.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.960
So, I rewind the
recording and...

34:56.962 --> 35:00.363
I can clearly hear there's another voice
that wasn't anyone there at the table.

35:00.965 --> 35:02.232
Listen to this.

35:02.533 --> 35:03.633
I'll boost it a bit.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.112
This may be a bit more
complicated than we thought.

35:16.848 --> 35:17.447
Play it again.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.418
<i>[Carl] It's taunting Joe.</i>

35:21.420 --> 35:22.853
<i>It's got personality to it.</i>

35:22.855 --> 35:25.021
It's putting him down.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.257
This then, was the voice
that Joe was hearing.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.127
[whispering] I'm
going to kill you.

35:31.395 --> 35:33.497
It was not his imagination.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.833
And it wasn't purely
a psychological anomaly.

35:36.835 --> 35:40.971
It was something detached
and something real.

35:41.839 --> 35:44.007
Something separate
from Joe himself.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.077
It's...

35:47.144 --> 35:50.647
actually responding intelligently to the
questions we're asking Joe and Danika.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.682
Or that they're asking us.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.985
And we have ourselves
a genuine haunting.

36:03.427 --> 36:06.596
<i>[narrator] The demonologists
return to the Menanos.</i>

36:06.598 --> 36:07.898
<i>To Joe and Danika,</i>

36:07.900 --> 36:10.367
<i>it couldn't happen fast enough.</i>

36:11.636 --> 36:13.470
We're so glad you guys are back.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.006
You said you'd got
voice on the tape.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.974
<i>[Joe] When they called
and said that they</i>

36:17.976 --> 36:19.376
had captured...

36:19.744 --> 36:21.711
speaking on their recording,

36:21.713 --> 36:23.647
I felt validated because
I knew it was real.

36:23.649 --> 36:26.082
Several, actually, Joe.

36:27.718 --> 36:31.588
What we think has been happening
to you is caused by a poltergeist.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.823
Brought on by the stress
of your near-death experience

36:33.825 --> 36:37.127
and opening up
your latent abilities.

36:37.129 --> 36:39.796
When someone has what we call
a near-death experience,

36:39.798 --> 36:41.364
[eerie sound]

36:43.234 --> 36:46.002
<i>It opens up a whole
new dimension for them.</i>

36:46.004 --> 36:48.638
<i>They're suddenly aware
that there's more out there.</i>

36:48.640 --> 36:51.174
And someone's life
is never the same

36:51.176 --> 36:53.009
after a near-death experience.

36:53.011 --> 36:57.247
Not only are poltergeists known to
wreak havoc by physically moving things,

36:57.448 --> 36:59.783
they can have a voice too.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.385
And it's that voice we're able to
hear through the recording we made.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.021
Listen to this.

37:05.122 --> 37:07.824
When I was transcribing the
notes from our last conversation,

37:07.826 --> 37:08.758
I realized,

37:08.760 --> 37:12.128
we'd also captured
an unnerving, deep growl.

37:13.030 --> 37:16.099
As well as several,
quite aggressive EVPs.

37:17.034 --> 37:18.301
Like this one.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.974
<i>Do you have a message for me?</i>

37:28.212 --> 37:30.180
[audio static]

37:32.650 --> 37:33.516
That's it.

37:34.852 --> 37:36.820
That's the voice
that's been torturing me!

37:36.822 --> 37:38.288
That's what I've been hearing.

37:39.790 --> 37:41.424
And now you're
hearing it too, right?

37:41.426 --> 37:42.993
Yes, Joey.

37:42.995 --> 37:44.261
We can hear it too.

37:44.695 --> 37:46.062
Oh, my God.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.798
<i>[Carl] This voice that previously
only Joe Menano had heard,</i>

37:48.800 --> 37:51.568
within his own hearing,
within his mind,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.803
had been taunting him,
deriding him,

37:53.805 --> 37:56.072
telling him he's worthless,
give it all up.

37:56.974 --> 37:58.041
Now we hear the voice.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.410
This turned everything around.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.145
It's a game changing moment.

38:02.413 --> 38:03.813
No longer do we think

38:03.815 --> 38:06.916
<i>it is just what's
happening in Joe's mind.</i>

38:06.918 --> 38:09.252
<i>It's assaulting him,
it's talking to him.</i>

38:09.954 --> 38:11.354
This is a real,

38:11.989 --> 38:13.890
parapsychological,

38:13.892 --> 38:14.991
phenomenon.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.192
So,

38:16.827 --> 38:18.328
this is real?

38:19.130 --> 38:21.097
Poltergeists are real?

38:22.733 --> 38:24.000
What are they?

38:24.635 --> 38:26.069
It's a German phrase,

38:26.071 --> 38:27.837
that literally means
noisy ghosts.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.040
But in today's terms,

38:30.042 --> 38:33.843
it's usually energy
coming from a living person.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.845
It's a call for attention.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.947
A call for help.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.950
A release of excess
energy that a person has.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.187
Leaving some sort of
mark on the universe.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.823
See, a poltergeist
is a construct.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.925
It takes a force.
It's very real.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.828
It's been documented.
It can move things.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.064
They can appear
as living beings,

38:54.066 --> 38:55.165
even though they aren't.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.268
[Joe] So, it's me?

38:59.470 --> 39:02.405
But it's not me?
That's a lot to take in.

39:02.407 --> 39:05.075
Now, just to be clear, Joe.
It is coming from you,

39:05.077 --> 39:07.777
from your emotions
needing a release,

39:07.779 --> 39:10.046
fear, stress, guilt...

39:10.048 --> 39:12.182
manifested outwards.

39:12.184 --> 39:14.784
It could be feelings connected
to leaving the force

39:14.818 --> 39:15.618
or...

39:16.921 --> 39:18.154
worry about letting
your father down.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.290
Joe.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.993
Your father was proud of you
till the day he died.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.162
And so am I.

39:27.431 --> 39:31.167
<i>[Carl] In my long experience
with investigating, I've...</i>

39:31.169 --> 39:33.970
encountered the demonic
numerous times.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.973
Never have I found a situation
where it was...

39:36.975 --> 39:39.042
so internalized.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.146
<i>Joe's was unique,</i>

39:43.148 --> 39:44.381
<i>because...</i>

39:44.383 --> 39:46.850
<i>it was his inner demon
that was speaking to him.</i>

39:46.852 --> 39:50.053
And I'm not talking about
a psychological inner demon.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.989
<i>It was living on its own.</i>

39:53.090 --> 39:54.824
<i>Except, within him.</i>

39:54.859 --> 39:56.760
<i>Speaking to him.</i>

39:56.762 --> 39:59.028
Never had a situation
like that before.

39:59.864 --> 40:00.797
Can we get rid of it?

40:00.799 --> 40:03.933
Yes, but it's going to
take time and effort.

40:03.935 --> 40:07.404
This entity has become very
real to you and that's it's power.

40:07.406 --> 40:10.774
You've got to treat it as a
separate personality and banish it.

40:10.808 --> 40:11.674
Diminish it.

40:12.843 --> 40:15.044
It's time to take back
your life, Joe.

40:16.881 --> 40:18.281
You got to treat the...

40:18.916 --> 40:20.450
activity like a... um,

40:20.452 --> 40:22.051
unruly child.

40:22.053 --> 40:25.722
Okay, don't give it any
unnecessary attention, especially,

40:25.724 --> 40:27.090
for behaving badly.

40:27.558 --> 40:29.225
We can't thank you enough.

40:33.864 --> 40:35.932
<i>[Joe] I eventually
just learned how to</i>

40:35.934 --> 40:37.801
<i>block it out
and forget about it.</i>

40:37.803 --> 40:39.235
You just have to find a balance.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.285
- Hey!
- Hi.

40:57.922 --> 40:59.155
This is for you.

40:59.857 --> 41:01.291
Thanks, baby doll.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.061
White wine? Smart.

41:05.663 --> 41:06.796
<i>[Joe] I learned a lot
about the paranormal.</i>

41:06.798 --> 41:10.266
<i>I feel like I've learned
a lot about myself.</i>

41:10.268 --> 41:13.102
And yeah, I mean, I still deal
with it from time to time but

41:13.104 --> 41:15.805
because I'm able to manage
it now I definitely think it's been

41:15.807 --> 41:17.407
more of a blessing than a curse

41:17.409 --> 41:18.775
because I came out the other end

41:18.777 --> 41:21.110
<i>a little bit wiser,
a little bit smarter.</i>

41:21.112 --> 41:23.079
<i>Understanding a lot more.</i>

41:23.948 --> 41:25.381
[eerie growling]

41:25.983 --> 41:27.116
Joey.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.119
What was that noise?

41:36.827 --> 41:38.428
I must have left
the faucet running

41:38.430 --> 41:40.063
when I washed my hands.

41:40.898 --> 41:41.931
- Okay.
- [Joe] Be right back.

41:41.933 --> 41:42.999
Okay.

41:47.104 --> 41:48.304
[eerie growling]
