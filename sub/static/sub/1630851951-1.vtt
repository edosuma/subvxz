WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:04.303
- Nah, we don't want none!
Don't come back over here!

00:07.641 --> 00:13.312
Lord, it's your favorite,
Leroy F. Brown.

00:13.414 --> 00:17.850
The F is for your favorite son.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.918
I just want you to look
after Jeremy

00:20.021 --> 00:21.453
while he in that prison there.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.555
Lord, please don't let him
get shanked

00:23.657 --> 00:25.724
'cause you know he ain't
about that smoke!

00:25.826 --> 00:28.394
You heard me?

00:28.496 --> 00:32.231
And, Lord, please don't let
that boy drop that soap.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.134
I don't want nobody
giving that boy a hard time

00:35.236 --> 00:36.668
if you know what I mean.

00:36.771 --> 00:37.970
You know what I mean, Lord.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.473
I don't want him to wake up dead
and be a dead man walking.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.142
- Speaking of dead man walking,

00:43.244 --> 00:44.910
if he had a good insurance
policy,

00:45.012 --> 00:46.578
we could probably pay
this place off.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.048
- Okay, Lord, I wanna
redo my prayer.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.482
I need you to take Vinny instead

00:50.584 --> 00:52.351
'cause I know you don't
like him.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.652
- Lord don't like you either.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.454
If he did he wouldn't put
you in them clothes.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.424
You know, I went to
jail one time.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.059
- Oh, you marched with
Dr. King,

01:00.161 --> 01:01.193
didn't you?
- No.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.062
- Brother Malcolm?
- Nope.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.229
- Oh, you was with
T'Challa and them?

01:04.331 --> 01:05.731
Wakanda forever.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.000
- No but we chatted.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.369
A female officer stopped
me at a traffic light

01:10.471 --> 01:12.671
and accused me of carrying a
concealed weapon.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.407
I said, "That ain't no
weapon, baby." [laughs]

01:15.509 --> 01:16.942
Turns out I didn't have nothing.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.178
But she was
so impressed with me,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.313
we started having conjugal
visits.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.782
Don't shoot.
Black lives matter.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.020
- Conjugal visits, that's when
they do your feet and stuff.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.923
- No, man--
- [laughing]

01:31.025 --> 01:32.257
- What is so funny, boy?

01:32.359 --> 01:33.659
- This dude on my
DingDong account

01:33.761 --> 01:36.161
is crying 'cause he thinks
he's going to jail.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.097
- ALL: [laughing]

01:38.199 --> 01:40.699
- That's funny. [laughing]

01:40.801 --> 01:42.067
That's real funny.

01:42.169 --> 01:43.435
I'm glad you're in a good mood

01:43.537 --> 01:45.771
'cause Vinny gotta tell
you something.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.107
- I got something? You tell him.
- You tell him.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.742
- I don't even like kids.
- He's your grandson.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.411
- Your daddy's on vacation.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.046
- Well, that's good, he
needs a vacation.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.347
- Not that kind of vacation.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.316
He on one of them hood vacations

01:57.418 --> 02:00.652
where he pressing license
plates on a concrete slab.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.987
He about to be swole.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.289
He about to have like a
teardrop tattoo,

02:04.391 --> 02:07.126
making shanks out of
toothbrushes, shanking people.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.261
- What are you talking about?

02:09.363 --> 02:10.896
- Your daddy's in the
slammer, man.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.132
- Wait, he's in jail? For what?!

02:13.234 --> 02:15.400
- He pimp slapped Sheriff
and got locked up again.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.969
We don't know if he
gonna get out.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.570
- If he'd have been a
rich white lady

02:18.672 --> 02:20.139
and cheated and got y'all
in one of them

02:20.241 --> 02:23.208
Poison Ivy League schools,
he probably wouldn't

02:23.310 --> 02:24.543
have even went to jail.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.878
- If we don't do something,
he's probably got

02:25.980 --> 02:29.148
his orange jumpsuit made
into a short set by now.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.583
- You and your sister are
about to be a statistic.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.219
- Look, look,
we have to do something.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.521
I don't want my
dad to die in jail

02:35.623 --> 02:37.189
and be known as Sweetness.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.424
- Wait, is your daddy an
organ donor?

02:39.527 --> 02:42.794
'Cause I just wanna know in case
I need an extra kidney.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.798
- ♪

02:46.901 --> 02:49.501

- I cannot believe it! They're
trying to throw the book at him.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.285
- Probably stop him from
being so stupid.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.387
[laughing]

03:08.489 --> 03:09.388
Too soon?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.623
- ALL: Yes.
- Too soon.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.593
- That Sheriff Luckett
is trying to bring us down.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.396
They're talking about
serious charges, Grandpa Vinny.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.564
- Wait, for what?

03:18.666 --> 03:21.833
- Pimp slapping in the
third degree.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.402
- It could be up to ten years.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.305
That would kill me--him, him.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.974
- Okay, if he--
if he gonna be dead,

03:29.076 --> 03:31.243
y'all think his insurance
policy will cover this place?

03:33.614 --> 03:35.614
Too soon?
- ALL: Too soon.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.617
- Well, I wasn't asking for me I
was asking for a friend.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.185
- Look, we have to free him.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.820
My dad's not built
for jail.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.689
- Okay, I'll tell y'all what
I'mma do,

03:43.791 --> 03:45.490
we gonna break him out.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.060
Like they did on the
Shawshank Redemption movie.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.462
- Wait a minute. Now how are we
supposed to do that, Mr. Brown?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.130
- Okay, this what we gonna do.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.567
Cora, you and Leah,
y'all gonna go to the back

03:55.669 --> 03:58.737
and put on some "Laisey" Dukes.

03:58.839 --> 04:03.075
When y'all walk in there, y'all
will cause a big distraction.

04:03.177 --> 04:06.945
Vinny, you go in there and you
sneak him an ice pick, right?

04:07.047 --> 04:08.880
And then he gonna just
stab the wall

04:08.983 --> 04:13.318
and dig himself a tunnel
in about 10 or 15 or 16--

04:13.420 --> 04:14.786
- Mr. Brown!
- MR. BROWN: --17 years.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.788
- Thank you for the hope,
Mr. Brown.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.491
- I'm trying to keep hope alive.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.693
Okay, I'mma go find something

04:21.795 --> 04:24.830
so I can pawn at the
Rob Ya Blind Pawn Shop, okay?

04:24.932 --> 04:25.998
You gonna need some
bail money.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.633
- You know, if you do
get some bail money

04:27.735 --> 04:29.301
and he does get out, I
say you take your whole

04:29.403 --> 04:31.937
little raggedy-ass family--
- Come on, Mr. Vinny!

04:32.039 --> 04:35.274
- Whole dang family, head
for the border.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.742
I swear I won't snitch.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.910
- Grandpa Vinny, you wouldn't
know what to do without us.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.345
- Oh, I'd know what to
do without y'all.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.481
But you got some tender ears
and freaks up in this house!

04:42.583 --> 04:43.949
- Grandpa!

04:44.051 --> 04:47.519
- Guys, this is serious.
What are we gonna do?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.755
- We can't even afford
the bail money.

04:51.358 --> 04:54.026
- He's gonna rot!

04:54.128 --> 04:55.227
- No, baby.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.629
- Cora, stop with him,
stop, stop babying this boy.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.031
And stop being so dramatic.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.500
Your dad ain't gonna rot.
Just stop being dramatic.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.436
- Mr. Brown, they want $5,000.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.238
- Oh, he gonna rot for sure.
- [wailing]

05:06.340 --> 05:08.674
- Oh, he already rot. I smell
his body from here.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.409
- They say that Sheriff
Luckett has a long history

05:10.511 --> 05:11.777
of wrongfully locking people up.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.945
Did y'all know that he
locked somebody up

05:14.048 --> 05:15.714
for kicking their imaginary
friend?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.050
Imaginary, imaginary.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.519
- Why are y'all sitting
here crying?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.020
Back in our day, we took action,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.656
we got folks together,
we made demands.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.358
Do something!
- Okay.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.793
- Now that's a good idea, Vinny!

05:27.895 --> 05:29.995
Oh, I tell ya I can go
make some signs.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.196
- Yeah.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.931
- CORA: We can hit the streets,
and make some noise!

05:33.033 --> 05:34.800
- ALL: Yeah!
- Ooh! No justice.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.668
No crooked police!
- ALL: Yeah!

05:36.770 --> 05:38.637
- We'll say it loud!
Free Jeremy now!

05:38.739 --> 05:40.405
- Yeah!
- Free Jeremy now!

05:40.507 --> 05:42.074
- Yeah!
- Free Mandela!

05:42.176 --> 05:44.409
- What?
- CORA: Free Tookey Wilson.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.178
- What?
- Wait, what? What?

05:46.280 --> 05:49.414
- Hey, hey, ho, ho, we
gotta let our Jeremy go.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.682
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.017
- You know, all of a sudden,

05:52.119 --> 05:55.554
that digging tunnel idea
don't sound like a bad idea.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.055
- Come here, come
here, I wanna tell you.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.257
I need you to start one
of them hash-brown campaigns.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.127
You know, like hashbrowns
scattered, covered, smothered.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.462
- You talking about hashtags,
Mr. Brown?

06:03.564 --> 06:04.830
- Yeah.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.365
- Okay look, I'll do a
#FREEJEREMY campaign

06:06.467 --> 06:07.466
on DingDong.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.800
- Oh, that is a great idea.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.669
Okay, I want you to go
get your sister in on this.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.972
She's been sleeping a long time.
- Ooh, you so intense.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.044
- ♪

06:19.146 --> 06:22.814
- Hey, hey, hey psst.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.285
- Oh my God, you're
being so loud.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.587
- I'm falling for you.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.722
- Oh, that's so sweet.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.357
- Hey, you sure you want
to do this?

06:32.459 --> 06:34.092
- Yes, I think.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.062
Look, we'll just drive off
into the sunset

06:37.164 --> 06:38.430
and find a small house.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.365
- Yeah, like a doghouse.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.967
With hardwood floors and AC.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.736
- [floor creaking]
- Hide, hide!

06:46.473 --> 06:48.507
- Dang, this door is raggedy.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.642
- Hi.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.545
- Uh, I thought you were asleep.
- How are you this morning?

06:53.647 --> 06:54.913
You look so good.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.082
I mean, your outfit,
it's on point.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.619
And your hair, it looks so good.
- Don't touch.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.788
- Uh, so what's up?

07:02.890 --> 07:05.090
- Uh, I thought you were asleep.

07:05.192 --> 07:09.327
- Oh, yeah, see I was and
then I just decided

07:09.430 --> 07:14.232
I was going to drop my
stuff off...

07:14.334 --> 07:19.604
at salvation soldiers.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.473
Salvation soldiers.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.608
Sorry, I'm--I'm still waking up.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.944
- Look, I need your help.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.613
Dad's back in jail because
of that stupid Sheriff.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.349
- What?! Get down!
- What?

07:31.452 --> 07:35.086
- No, no, no. No, no, no. What?

07:35.189 --> 07:37.489
- I was saying Mom said he's
gonna rot

07:37.591 --> 07:40.592
unless we do something.
- Like what?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.894
- I don't know.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.263
I got it, why don't you call
up that goofy-looking

07:45.365 --> 07:46.665
boyfriend of yours--

07:46.767 --> 07:48.233
- Get down!
- What?

07:48.335 --> 07:50.569
- Uh, uh, see I was just
saying--I was just saying

07:50.671 --> 07:55.640
we should get down and
pray for dad.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.209
You should pray for dad, yeah.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.544
- I'm pretty sure Cora's
doing that already.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.012
- You're right,
she got that covered.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.881
- But if we call your
goofy-looking boyfriend up

08:02.983 --> 08:06.084
and tell him to come over
here, we can--

08:06.186 --> 08:09.821
we can tie him up,
hold him as a hostage,

08:09.923 --> 08:15.060
and Chinese water torture him
until his dad lets Pops go!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.294
- Okay, no.

08:16.396 --> 08:19.264
We are not doing that to him.
That is way too extreme.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.233
- What?
- Get down!

08:21.335 --> 08:23.435
Uh, sorry, sorry.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.971
- Look, Dad being in jail
is extreme.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.539
We're taking it to social media.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.274
I set up my DingDong account.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.644
I'm gonna expose him and
bring him to his knees!

08:32.746 --> 08:33.712
- I like the sound of that.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.514
- Yeah, because we've
been bamboozled,

08:35.616 --> 08:37.849
hoodwinked, led astray!

08:37.951 --> 08:38.984
I didn't land on Plymouth Rock!

08:39.086 --> 08:42.087
Plymouth Rock landed on Dad!
- Yeah.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.655
- And I've seen the
Promised Land!

08:43.757 --> 08:46.057

17:05.492 --> 17:07.325
I got a call that he was here.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.693
Where's he hiding?

17:08.795 --> 17:11.662
- It's hard hiding out isn't
it, Sheriff Lucky-ett?

17:11.765 --> 17:12.930

17:13.033 --> 17:15.333

I call them blue balls.

- Lindor? Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

17:22.642 --> 17:24.976

about Jeremy's bail.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.844
- How about some chips?

17:26.946 --> 17:28.846
I hear they go well
with bail.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.482
- If my son is not out here
in two minutes,

17:31.584 --> 17:34.052
I'm gonna have to tell the judge
that Jeremy is a flight risk.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.553
And there won't be any bail.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.189

Sheriff Lucky?
