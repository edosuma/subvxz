10:41.370 --> 10:46.307

11:14.900 --> 11:17.209
ERADICATE MEMORIES, CHRISTIAN.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.573
MR. GIDEON, BUT WITH SUCH A

12:28.580 --> 12:30.377

12:30.380 --> 12:31.938
YOU RISK THE CLIMB IN THE FIRST

12:32.920 --> 12:34.046
Gideon: I WAS A MEDIC IN THE

12:35.180 --> 12:37.887
OUT OF HELICOPTERS. THEN I MET

12:37.890 --> 12:39.983
MY WIFE, HAD MY KIDS, AND GOT A

12:39.990 --> 12:41.810
JOB AS A HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE

12:43.460 --> 12:45.951

12:45.960 --> 12:47.154
SCARED.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.593

12:48.600 --> 12:51.194
Gideon: LOSING WHO I WAS.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.929
BUT WHEN YOU ARE TICKING OFF THE

YEARS PAST 40 AND THE SAILING IS

12:55.440 --> 12:57.203

12:57.210 --> 12:58.563
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING,

12:58.570 --> 13:00.003
I'M CLOSER TO THE END OF MY

13:00.010 --> 13:02.171
LIFE THAN I AM TO THE BEGINNING.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.375
I DECIDED THAT I WANTED MY KIDS

13:04.380 --> 13:06.007

13:06.010 --> 13:08.149
FATHER WHO HAD LIVED HIS LIFE

13:08.150 --> 13:10.015
RATHER THAN THE SHELL OF A MAN

13:10.020 --> 13:12.955
WHO SURRENDERED TO FEAR. SO I,

TOTALLY NUMB, BUT ON THE INSIDE,
