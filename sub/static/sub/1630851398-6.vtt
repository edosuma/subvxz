<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:17.684 --> 00:20.353
<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:22.939
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.859
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:25.942 --> 00:28.528
<i>Under here, over there</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:31.031
<i>Science is everywhere you look</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:34.075
<i>With Iggy Peck, architect</i>

00:34.159 --> 00:36.453
<i>And Rosie Revere, engineer</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:39.122
<i>So much to do and you can help too!</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:42.042
<i>A mystery, a riddle, a puzzle or a quest</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:45.128
<i>There are wonders to discover</i>
<i>And hypotheses to test</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:46.629
<i>Science is the best!</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:49.174
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:49.257 --> 00:51.926
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:52.010 --> 00:56.222
<i>Everywhere science is</i>
<i>She’s forming a hypothesis</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:59.601
<i>Connecting all the dots</i>
<i>’Cause this is scientist Ada Twist!</i>

01:10.445 --> 01:13.406
Come on, please be a five.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.743
-Oh, man.
-It’s a two. That’s three less than five.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.328
And that means…

01:18.411 --> 01:19.704
Roar!

01:19.788 --> 01:22.082
You’ve been turned into a werewolf, Iggy.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.542
According to the rules
of <i>Goblins and Dragons</i>,

01:24.626 --> 01:26.544
you can’t speak till your next turn.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.588
You can only howl like a werewolf.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.006
I can only howl?

01:31.341 --> 01:32.467
I mean…

01:34.219 --> 01:39.182
Iggy, werewolf howls are louder than that.
Put your back into it!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.020
Yuck!

01:45.188 --> 01:47.732
Something smells like goblin’s breath.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.111
That smell, it’s terrible.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.571
-Horrible.
-Toe-curling.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.908
-We have to find out what it is.
-Say what now?

01:56.991 --> 02:01.121
This stink is a mystery,
a riddle, a puzzle, a quest,

02:01.204 --> 02:03.706
and we’re going
to get to the bottom of it.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.711
I don’t smell it anymore. Where’d it go?

02:10.421 --> 02:12.799
Now I smell something. It smells like--

02:12.882 --> 02:15.593
Like the yummiest yumminess ever.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.847
Does this mean my famous veggie soup
smells good?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.890
-So good.
-Delicious.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.268
What veggies are you using, Dad?

02:23.351 --> 02:27.897
Carrots, celery, tomatoes, onions
and garlic for extra deliciousness.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.732
Same ones for the salad too.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.779
Same veggies as the soup,
but these barely smell at all.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.491
-The stink is back.
-Yes.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.368
Let’s follow our noses.

02:41.870 --> 02:45.832
Carpet smells carpet-y, but not stinky.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.544
Smells like reading.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.839
It’s not Mooshu’s litter box.

02:52.922 --> 02:56.217
It actually smells surprisingly okay.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.512
Yeah. Kitty litter is designed
to absorb icky smells.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.682
And Arthur and I take turns
cleaning it every day.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.402
The source of the great stink.
Arthur’s tennis shoes.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.989
-The grand slam of stink.
-What are you kids doing?

03:18.072 --> 03:21.576
We just made a fascinating discovery.
You have stinky shoes.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.371
I know. They don’t smell when I wear them.
Only when I take them off.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.498
Great observation, Arthur.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.001
Do you like having stinky shoes?

03:30.084 --> 03:33.254
No! I don’t want my shoes
to make the whole house smell.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.256
That’s why I’m going to try this.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.759
Mum uses perfume
to make herself smell good,

03:37.842 --> 03:40.220
so maybe it’ll make my shoes
smell good too.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.138
A test! Can we observe?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.598
I guess.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.102
It does smell like Mum.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.149
But now the perfume
is mixed with the stink,

03:53.233 --> 03:57.487
so it smells like your mum
plus stinkiness.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.531
There’s no way I can un-stink these shoes.

04:00.615 --> 04:04.452
There’s almost always
a way to solve a problem with science.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.621
Let’s see if we can solve this one.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.540
-Does that mean a brainstorm?
-Ding, ding! Correct!

04:09.624 --> 04:11.626
Great, ’cause I have an idea.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.671
Whenever I’m stinky,
my mum makes me take a bath.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.798
We could give Arthur’s shoes a bath.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.007
I love bath time.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.635
It’s when I think
of some of my best questions.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.763
But wet, slippery shoes
could be dangerous for Arthur.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.016
True. We could put them in the dryer?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.143
That might ruin the shoes.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.271
Luckily, I’ve got another idea.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.357
Since cat litter soaks up icky smells,

04:34.440 --> 04:37.235
we could pour some in the shoes
to get rid of the stink.

04:37.318 --> 04:42.115
Good thinking, but what if Mooshu
thinks Arthur’s shoes are her litter box?

04:43.157 --> 04:44.909
-No, Mooshu!
-I can’t watch!

04:45.660 --> 04:47.036
I have another idea.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.540
We could invent a special spray
that gets rid of the smell.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.208
Like a perfume. Yeah.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.545
Except instead of making it smell
like something nice,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.755
we’d make it smell like nothing at all.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.632
-A no-fume?
-Precisely.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.885
But we don’t want
to accidentally ruin Arthur’s shoes,

05:02.969 --> 05:05.054
so we can do our tests on this.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.556
I outgrew it last year,

05:06.639 --> 05:09.142
so my mum said
we could use it for science.

05:09.225 --> 05:13.021
We just need to make it super stinky
before we use it.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.199
Loading the lab.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.003
Smells like success.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.005
That is stinky!

05:39.088 --> 05:42.508
I don’t know if my nose
can handle this much success.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.594
Maybe your nose doesn’t have to.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.931
Sometimes, scientists need
special equipment for certain tests.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.809
-Now we’re ready. Let’s hit it!
-Yeah.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.079
Oh no!

06:11.162 --> 06:15.458
That’s the gooiest flop I’ve ever seen.
It’s a glop!

06:15.541 --> 06:20.338
Or a floop. Maybe Arthur was right.
De-stinking his shoes is impossible.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.466
Sorry. That was my belly.

06:23.549 --> 06:27.637
When’s dinner?
Your dad’s soup smells so good.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.014
You know, the salad’s probably tasty too,

06:30.098 --> 06:32.600
even though it doesn’t smell
as good as the soup.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.269
Wait. Why doesn’t it smell as good?

06:35.353 --> 06:38.648
-It has the same ingredients.
-I don’t know why they smell different.

06:38.731 --> 06:44.153
I just know that a hot, tasty soup
makes my belly feel nice and warm.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.571
Soups are hot.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.782
And salads are cold.

06:47.865 --> 06:51.285
I know that look.
Do you have a hy-potty-what-asis?

06:51.953 --> 06:52.870
Yep.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.164
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:57.959
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>

06:58.543 --> 06:59.752
<i>-Does that</i>
<i>-Observation</i>

06:59.836 --> 07:01.295
<i>-Mean this</i>
<i>-Explanation?</i>

07:01.379 --> 07:04.882
<i>Right or wrong</i>
<i>Let’s find out what the answer is</i>

07:04.966 --> 07:07.802
<i>It might not be right</i>
<i>But we’re going to find out</i>

07:07.885 --> 07:10.430
<i>What this theory is all about</i>

07:10.513 --> 07:12.974
<i>-An educated guess</i>
<i>-But will it stand up to our test?</i>

07:13.057 --> 07:14.976
<i>Yes, that’s what a hypothesis is</i>

07:15.059 --> 07:17.603
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>

07:17.687 --> 07:20.815
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>

07:20.898 --> 07:24.152
<i>Let’s find out how right it is</i>

07:24.235 --> 07:25.361
<i>Let’s go!</i>

07:26.154 --> 07:31.075
And our hypothesis is
hot things smell more than cold things.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.454
Can temperature
really make things smell different?

07:34.537 --> 07:37.915
Well, when it’s hot,
your molecules move really fast

07:37.999 --> 07:39.792
and bounce around like this.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.379
Like a wizard shooting fireballs.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.630
Exactly.

07:44.714 --> 07:48.384
And when it’s cold,
air molecules move slower,

07:48.468 --> 07:52.263
like this.

07:52.346 --> 07:56.642
So smells travel through the air faster
when it’s hot.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.646
That’s what I’m thinking,
but there’s only one way to find out.

08:01.898 --> 08:06.152
Think cool thoughts,
because it’s about to get toasty in here.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.199
Did we teleport to the sun?

08:11.282 --> 08:14.285
Need water. So thirsty.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.292
I love a nice dry heat.

08:21.375 --> 08:25.379
Well, I think it’s definitely hot enough
to test our hypothesis.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.342
-Ready for a sniff test?
-I don’t know how much stink I can take.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.094
You can do it, Iggy. Come on. Let’s go.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.556
On the count of three. One, two, three.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.270
That is the smelliest smell
I’ve ever smelled.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.399
And the stinkiest stink I have ever stunk.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.320
Looks like heat does make things smellier,
but to prove our whole hypothesis,

08:49.403 --> 08:51.739
we need to see if the cold
makes things less smelly.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.157
Bring on the cold.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.993
I mean, bring back the heat.

08:56.077 --> 09:00.456
First, we’ve got to see if the cold
de-stunk Arthur’s shoes. Ready?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.583
So cold.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.129
It smells like… nothing.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.589
It’s not stinky at all.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.260
-Which means we proved our hypothesis.
-Does that mean we can be warm again?

09:12.927 --> 09:13.761
Yep.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.055
Much better.

09:16.973 --> 09:21.519
Except now that it’s not cold,
Arthur’s shoes are back to being smelly.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.772
We need a way to keep his shoes cold
when he’s not wearing them

09:24.855 --> 09:26.148
so they don’t stink.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.483
The solution is obvious.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.652
We freeze Arthur’s shoes
into giant ice cubes.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.405
That would solve the stink problem,

09:32.488 --> 09:36.826
but I think Arthur wants tennis shoes,
not ice skates.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.328
Didn’t think about that part.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.123
Maybe he could keep them in the freezer?

09:42.873 --> 09:46.836
My mum probably won’t like dirty shoes
next to all the food though.

09:46.919 --> 09:51.799
So what if we created a shoebox
that’s kind of like a freezer,

09:51.882 --> 09:53.676
just for Arthur’s shoes?

09:53.759 --> 09:59.515
A freezer with an awesome design.
We could make it look like an ice palace!

09:59.599 --> 10:02.351
Brr-rilliant! Now let’s get building.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.703
-What are you doing to my shoes?
-We’re freezing the stink.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.040
Wait! I don’t smell anything!

10:24.123 --> 10:28.586
That’s because the cold air is keeping
the stink from going all over the place.

10:28.669 --> 10:32.256
So you found a way to keep my shoes
from smelling up the house?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.466
-Sure did.
-Yep.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.426
That’s amazing. Thanks.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.346
You kids might be on to something
with this science stuff.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.184
What’s that smell?

10:44.644 --> 10:48.648
It smells delicious.
Must be your dad’s famous veggie soup.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.400
-Sure is.
-Yep.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.777
-Definitely.
-Just the soup.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.237
Nothing else, like shoes or anything.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.073
Shoes?

10:59.950 --> 11:02.286
This soup really does taste
as good as it smells.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.080
The salad tastes great too.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.499
Thanks, team. Glad you like it.

11:06.582 --> 11:10.461
And I’m glad this soup
is the only thing smelling in our house.

11:10.544 --> 11:11.921
Me too!

11:20.096 --> 11:24.183
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.276
Hi, I’m Rachel Dutton
and I’m a microbiologist.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.405
Today, we’re gonna talk
about what makes cheese stinky.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.614
<i>Let’s go!</i>

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
So we came to the cheese shop today

11:41.784 --> 11:44.870
to get a closer look
at some of the microbes

11:44.954 --> 11:48.749
that actually make cheese
both taste good and make it stinky.

11:48.833 --> 11:53.921
Microbes are very tiny cells
that you’d never see with just your eyes.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.090
You have to use microscopes to see them.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.384
These microbes are found everywhere.

11:58.467 --> 12:03.639
They’re found in the ocean, in the soil
and on some of the foods that we eat.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.684
So really, a lot of what we smell
around us in the world,

12:06.767 --> 12:10.187
not just cheese,
is actually because of the microbes.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.441
This particular microbe
that we’re looking at now

12:13.524 --> 12:17.153
is one of the most common bacteria
that you find growing on cheese.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.780
It creates a lot
of delicious flavours on cheese,

12:19.864 --> 12:21.866
but also makes it really stinky.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.744
So one of the things that cheese-makers do

12:24.827 --> 12:27.538
to actually control
how much the microbes grow on cheese

12:27.621 --> 12:29.123
is they control temperature.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.585
So the warmer the temperature,
the stinkier the cheese.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.756
This cheese
is a special type of cheese from France,

12:36.839 --> 12:41.635
and these holes
are actually from little tiny bugs.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.180
Those little tiny bugs
are called cheese mites.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.015
The mites will actually create

12:46.098 --> 12:49.268
really interesting flavours and smells
on the cheese themselves.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.479
So it’s not just microbes
that can make smells.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.231
It’s actually other organisms
that live on the cheese.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.775
-Hello.
-Fun fact!

12:55.858 --> 12:58.819
One of the microbes
that grows on cheese and makes it stinky

12:58.903 --> 13:01.363
is the same type of microbe
that grows on our feet.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.658
So when people think that stinky cheese
smells like stinky feet,

13:04.742 --> 13:07.328
it’s because it’s the same type
of microbe growing

13:07.411 --> 13:09.622
and producing the same stinky smells.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.669
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!

13:22.927 --> 13:25.763
-Mooshu’s new cat toy is done.
-Cool.

13:25.846 --> 13:29.850
I calculated it so it’s the perfect mix
of curly and crinkly.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.560
Let’s see if she likes it.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.648
Yep. She loves it.

13:35.731 --> 13:40.027
Especially the crinkly part.
Why do cats love things that crinkle?

13:41.278 --> 13:43.572
Mooshu is so cute.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.407
I wish I had a pet.

13:45.491 --> 13:50.246
But since my mum travels for work,
she says we couldn’t give one a good home.

13:50.329 --> 13:54.333
I guess that makes sense.
Taking care of a pet is a lot of work.

13:54.416 --> 13:58.003
-But maybe you could get one that isn’t.
-Like a goldfish.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.756
They just swim all day.
You don’t even have to walk them.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.800
But you do have to feed ’em.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.760
And they’re hard to hug.

14:05.302 --> 14:10.099
Maybe a monkey.
They love to hug. And play.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.810
-Maybe a little too much.
-True.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.896
What about a ladybug?

14:15.980 --> 14:19.733
You don’t have to walk or play with them,
and they’re adorable.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.820
But they need food
and a space to crawl around.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.864
Plus they’re easy to lose.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.073
Here, ladybug.

14:26.156 --> 14:29.869
True. You don’t want to step
on a ladybug lost in your house.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.122
So you need a pet that doesn’t eat,

14:33.205 --> 14:36.125
doesn’t need to play,
and doesn’t need hugs.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.626
Sounds like a rock.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.004
Yeah, I could get a pet rock.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.922
I was kidding.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.842
I wasn’t. Let’s get my pet rock right now.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.011
We can find one in my back garden.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.306
Those rocks already have a home.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.017
I want a wild rock that needs one.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.021
But where could we find a wild rock?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.357
I know. The park!

15:02.401 --> 15:06.071
-Hi, Mum!
-Ada, you startled me. What’s up?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.574
I was going to ask you
to take us to the park,

15:08.657 --> 15:10.034
but if you’re working--

15:10.117 --> 15:13.662
I am working… on this crossword puzzle.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.331
Mum!

15:15.831 --> 15:17.458
I’m stuck on this work problem.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.753
When that happens,
taking a break usually does the trick.

15:20.836 --> 15:25.007
Please let me take you to the park
so I can take a brain break.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.384
Yay, we’re here.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.681
Here. This looks like a good spot.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.684
Thanks, Mum. We’re going
to look for some wild pet rocks.

15:35.768 --> 15:40.314
Wild pet rocks? Okay. Don’t feed them.
And stay where I can see you.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.440
We will.

15:43.150 --> 15:47.321
There are so many rocks here.
I don’t even know where to start.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.866
This one’s blue and round. Oh, and shiny.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.369
I love it! Definite maybe.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.578
Check this one out.

15:54.662 --> 15:58.499
It has fuzzy moss on top. It’s so cute.

15:58.582 --> 15:59.833
I love that one too.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.380
These two look like twins.

16:04.463 --> 16:09.051
Nice. This rock with this cool chip rocks!

16:09.134 --> 16:11.512
So many choices. Let’s keep looking.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.641
Rosie, that’s a pretty big pile
of possible pets.

16:15.724 --> 16:19.395
Yeah. How do we choose
which one to take home?

16:19.895 --> 16:21.480
Rock, paper, scissors?

16:21.563 --> 16:23.816
I could never choose just one!

16:24.400 --> 16:27.277
There’s something special
about every rock.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.362
Like Mossy.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.073
So fluffy and cute.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.491
So cute.

16:32.574 --> 16:36.120
Rocko and Milla are brother and sister.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.538
I can’t separate them.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.707
And Chippy has a chip.

16:39.790 --> 16:45.337
No one else will ever want him but me.
So I have to take them all.

16:45.421 --> 16:49.174
Okay. There’s just one problem.
How are we going to get them home?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.010
Easy. In our pockets.

16:51.093 --> 16:55.222
I can’t move my legs.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.640
They’re really heavy.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.562
Okay, not our pockets.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.689
Maybe I can use my scarf.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.608
Stay.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.819
Stay.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.281
Who’s a good rock? You’re a good rock.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.784
They keep falling out.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.579
Guess ’cause they’re wild.
Training’s gonna be a doozy.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.415
Know what we could use?

17:21.498 --> 17:22.833
I know! A brainstorm.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.084
Great idea.

17:24.168 --> 17:27.004
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

17:27.087 --> 17:29.548
<i>Throw in every thought you had</i>
<i>No idea is ever bad</i>

17:29.631 --> 17:32.468
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

17:32.551 --> 17:35.429
<i>Gather up your friends</i>
<i>Try to find the how, the what, the why</i>

17:35.512 --> 17:38.265
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

17:38.348 --> 17:42.936
<i>Let our imaginations</i>
<i>Become great new creations</i>

17:43.020 --> 17:46.774
<i>When we brainstorm, brainstorm</i>
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

17:46.857 --> 17:47.858
<i>Hey!</i>

17:48.692 --> 17:53.197
What if we poofed the rocks home?
Chabracadabra!

17:54.323 --> 17:57.326
I mean abrakazizzle!

17:58.452 --> 18:03.165
But I can’t remember the spell words,
which might cause a bigger problem.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.504
What if we put your house on wheels
and moved it here?

18:09.004 --> 18:12.049
I’d guesstimate
we’d need roughly a zillion wheels.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.175
Yeah, you’re right.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.345
We could get ladybugs
to fly ants that carry the rocks.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.679
Ants are strong.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.140
But ladybugs aren’t that strong.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.976
Any other ideas?

18:24.937 --> 18:25.938
I got nothing.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.358
Unicorns?

18:30.150 --> 18:33.028
Hey, that’s usually my line.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.905
Ants, but no ladybugs.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.074
Unicorns.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.159
I already said that.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.536
Cheese.

18:41.120 --> 18:41.995
Cheese?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.497
I’m hungry.

18:43.580 --> 18:48.001
Oh no! I think we ran out of ideas!

18:48.085 --> 18:49.795
What? We never run out of ideas.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.548
We need to keep brainstorming.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.050
I have to get my pet rocks home.

18:55.134 --> 18:59.138
But I can’t think anymore.
My mind feels like goo.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.597
My mush is mind-y.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.307
I mean my mind is mushy.

19:02.975 --> 19:07.938
-What if my mind turns to mush forever?
-What are we gonna do? We’re stuck.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.439
Stuck.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.524
Stuck!

19:10.607 --> 19:12.985
What if we stuck the rocks to…

19:13.068 --> 19:14.153
Oh, I don’t know.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.572
It’s like my brain broke.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.783
Wait a second.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.244
I’m stuck on this work problem.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.205
When that happens,
taking a break usually does the trick.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.625
I think I just connected the polka dots.

19:28.709 --> 19:32.504
My mum’s taking a brain break
because she was stuck on a work problem.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.673
We’re stuck, so maybe we need a break.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.008
A play break.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.552
No! We think should.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.388
I mean, we should think.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.933
Okay, we can take a break.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.787
These sunflowers look like
they’d make a pretty cool catapult.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.375
Who knew sunflowers were such a design…

20:11.168 --> 20:12.085
wonder?

20:12.169 --> 20:15.505
It’s like there’s little flowers
inside the flowers.

20:15.589 --> 20:19.468
There are. Sunflowers are made
of thousands of tiny flowers.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.678
They smell so good.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.558
Why do flowers smell so good?

20:26.642 --> 20:30.354
Hey, my brain’s coming up
with information and questions again.

20:30.437 --> 20:34.066
-And my mind doesn’t feel mushy.
-Our play break worked.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.610
Yay. Let’s get back to our brainstorm.

20:36.693 --> 20:41.657
I know. We could charm owls
into flying the rocks home for us.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.492
I’m very charming.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.994
Owls don’t work during the day.
They’re nocturnal.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.622
Oh yeah, they’re only awake at night.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.459
We could make a roller coaster
to carry the rocks.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.086
I love that idea.

20:54.628 --> 20:58.757
But what if the roller coaster’s wobbly
and the rocks roll out?

20:58.840 --> 21:02.761
Then it would be
a rock and roller coaster!

21:03.929 --> 21:07.432
Maybe we can build something
so we can haul the rocks.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.602
Yeah. We could call it
a Rosie Rock-Hauler.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.522
Great idea. Let’s build it!

21:13.605 --> 21:17.442
It could have a big net for the rocks.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.320
-And a frame to hold them in.
-And wheels.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.115
And done.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.324
-Love it.
-Nice.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.743
Let’s get materials.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.338
We can weave these vines together
for the net.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.384
-These sticks will make a nifty frame.
-Found these wheels around the park.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.469
Can I build it now? Can I?

21:44.553 --> 21:45.887
-Yes.
-Go for it.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.566
We’ve got a Rosie Rock-Hauler.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.568
-It’s perfect.
-Good job, Rosie.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.446
Thanks. Let’s see if it’s strong enough
for my pets.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.574
Yay. It is.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.992
Let’s finish loading.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.836
-Hi, Lorraine.
-Hello.

22:17.919 --> 22:18.837
How was your flight?

22:20.297 --> 22:21.757
That flight was a doozy.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.675
-Come on in.
-Mum!

22:23.759 --> 22:27.304
Hey, Rosie-posy-pudding-pie.
How was your day?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.809
I got pets. Lots of them.

22:32.893 --> 22:33.977
You what?

22:34.061 --> 22:36.063
It’s not what you think. Come see!

22:36.146 --> 22:39.649
Meet my pet rocks.

22:40.150 --> 22:45.030
That’s Chippy. This is Rocko and Milla.
And here’s Mossy.

22:45.113 --> 22:49.326
I never thought we’d be able
to have a pet with my travel schedule,

22:49.409 --> 22:50.369
but rocks?

22:50.452 --> 22:51.661
Creative.

22:51.745 --> 22:52.871
Attagirl.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.833
Right? These three are the best
at thinking their way out of problems.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.462
We did run out of ideas,
but then we took a play break,

23:00.545 --> 23:03.256
like your brain break, Mum,
but with playing.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.593
-You were right. It did do the trick.
-I’m glad that helped, sweetie.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.887
So let’s take your pets home.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.181
Okay, but first…

23:11.890 --> 23:15.227
You should take the blue one, Iggy.
You bonded.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.228
Thanks, Rosie!

23:16.311 --> 23:20.190
And take Mossy, Ada.
You’re perfect together.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.858
Really? Thanks!

23:23.527 --> 23:25.153
Don’t worry, Mooshu.

23:25.237 --> 23:29.032
I may have a pet rock,
but you’re still my favourite kitty.

23:36.123 --> 23:40.210
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.297
Hello!

23:45.257 --> 23:48.385
Hi, I’m Raquel Nuno
and I’m a planetary scientist,

23:48.468 --> 23:53.306
and today we are going to talk
about rocks from space.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.934
When we think of rocks,

23:56.017 --> 23:59.646
you think of the rocks that you might find
at the park or on your hike,

23:59.729 --> 24:03.150
but there’s actually lots of rocks
just floating around in space.

24:03.233 --> 24:08.363
At some point, they entered our atmosphere
and crashed onto the surface of the Earth,

24:08.447 --> 24:11.408
and now we have them here
in our meteorite gallery.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.453
Rocks that came from space
and landed on Earth,

24:14.536 --> 24:15.871
we call those meteorites.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.458
These are our massive
iron meteorites here.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.793
So if you’re out rock hunting,

24:21.877 --> 24:24.921
one of the ways that you know
that you’ve found a meteorite

24:25.005 --> 24:27.507
is by seeing if it’s magnetic.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.303
The rocks here on Earth
are usually not magnetic.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.681
The types of rocks
that are floating around in space,

24:34.764 --> 24:38.393
they range from something
as small as a speck of dust

24:38.477 --> 24:42.105
all the way to something
as big as almost a planet.

24:42.189 --> 24:45.692
The Earth is essentially
just a big rock floating in space.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.988
You can actually see
space rocks coming in to Earth.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.323
That’s meteor showers.

24:51.406 --> 24:56.161
They’re tiny pieces of dust and rocks
that enter our atmosphere and burn up.

24:56.244 --> 24:59.039
We see them as bright streaks
across our sky.

24:59.122 --> 25:02.083
So don’t forget to look up
next time you’re outside at night.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.419
You might just catch a meteor shower.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.504
Fun fact!

25:06.087 --> 25:07.964
The moon is shrinking.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.217
It turns out that, inside the moon,

25:10.300 --> 25:12.385
there are rocks that are hot,

25:12.469 --> 25:14.679
but as they cool off, they shrink,

25:14.763 --> 25:17.307
and so the whole moon is getting smaller.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.434
Don’t worry.
You’ll still be able to see it.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.689
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!
