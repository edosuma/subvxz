WEBVTT

00:26.026 --> 00:27.751
Stop sulking.

00:27.855 --> 00:29.546
If you can't follow through
with my first condition,

00:29.650 --> 00:31.065
what the hell are
we doing here?

00:31.169 --> 00:32.308
If he says
the word attachment,

00:32.411 --> 00:34.172
detachment, or Oedipal,
I'm leaving.

00:34.275 --> 00:37.520
Yes, we've covered that.

00:37.623 --> 00:40.316
Tahlia, Connor, welcome.

00:40.419 --> 00:42.180
-I'm Dr. Keating.
-Let's just get straight to it.

00:42.283 --> 00:44.768
We don't want to talk about
our parents or our childhood.

00:44.872 --> 00:46.184
All you need to know is
that he is adopted

00:46.287 --> 00:47.564
and his mother's
one of yours.

00:47.668 --> 00:49.601
A psychiatrist.

00:49.704 --> 00:51.879
-Psychologist.
-Whatever.

00:51.982 --> 00:55.089
We are here because he cheated
on me with his boss' wife

00:55.193 --> 00:56.884
and we just got married.

00:56.987 --> 00:58.817
Was that in chronological order?

00:58.920 --> 01:00.474
-Mm-hmm.
-Yep.

01:08.033 --> 01:10.898
Okay, Dan...

01:11.001 --> 01:13.625
what do kids hate?

01:13.728 --> 01:15.385
Maths.
What do they love?

01:15.489 --> 01:16.766
Their footy heroes.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.388
I'm not sure how those
two things are connected.

01:18.492 --> 01:20.183
Okay, so I've had a month
having a stubborn-off with Toni,

01:20.287 --> 01:21.495
and you know
what I realized?

01:21.598 --> 01:23.117
I don't have to be
at school to teach.

01:23.221 --> 01:25.602
Okay. Who are you and what have
you done with my girlfriend?

01:25.706 --> 01:27.535
I think I've figured out
a way to teach

01:27.639 --> 01:29.710
high school kids maths
by using footy stats,

01:29.813 --> 01:31.125
and they won't even know
that they're learning.

01:31.229 --> 01:35.440
-Yeah, right.
-I present to you...

01:35.543 --> 01:37.304
A Paige of Stats.

01:37.407 --> 01:39.996
It's like fun,
educational content, online.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.688
I'll make a web site,
do, like, videos.

01:42.792 --> 01:44.311
It'll be heaps interactive.

01:44.414 --> 01:47.314
Are you doing this...
for me?

01:47.417 --> 01:49.385
Um, no.

01:49.488 --> 01:51.456
No, I just was mucking around,
I thought it might have legs.

01:51.559 --> 01:54.493
I know we've been at a bit
of a weird place,

01:54.597 --> 01:56.081
but you don't have to rush
into this.

01:56.185 --> 01:57.427
Yeah.
I know, I was just...

01:57.531 --> 01:58.704
I know you're gonna find
a full-time job.

01:58.808 --> 02:00.396
...thinking outside
of the box.

02:00.499 --> 02:03.951
This is cool as, like, a side
hobby or a part-time thing.

02:04.054 --> 02:06.540
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what it is.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.545
Maddy: How's your calf?

02:11.648 --> 02:12.925
Yeah, good as new.

02:13.029 --> 02:15.135
I was worried I might've
gone overboard

02:15.238 --> 02:16.826
on the dance floor
last weekend.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.414
Well, it is
your signature move.

02:18.517 --> 02:21.348
But been smashin' it at the gym,
running 10K a day,

02:21.451 --> 02:22.694
and the docs are happy.

02:22.797 --> 02:25.214
I feel...good.

02:25.317 --> 02:27.492
You look good.
Right.

02:27.595 --> 02:30.736
You, mister, have got choir
today and you, my darling girl,

02:30.840 --> 02:32.704
are going to bake cookies
with JJ, and Dad

02:32.807 --> 02:35.741
is going to pass his fitness
test with flying colors.

02:35.845 --> 02:37.467
And I'm gonna help Andrew
extricate his assets

02:37.571 --> 02:39.538
from yet another
messy marriage.

02:39.642 --> 02:40.919
You know you
didn't have to?

02:41.022 --> 02:43.542
We both know I did.
He's your boss.

02:43.646 --> 02:45.855
Every excruciating minute
that I have to spend with him

02:45.958 --> 02:48.133
is because of you.

02:48.237 --> 02:50.411
Wish Dad lots of luck.
Say, "Go, Dad!" Go, Dad!

02:50.515 --> 02:51.585
-Go, Dad!
-Go, Dad!

02:53.414 --> 02:56.900
Now that you've created an
energy circle with your hands,

02:57.004 --> 03:00.352
close your eyes,
focus on your breathing.

03:05.012 --> 03:07.497
When you find a place
of stillness,

03:07.601 --> 03:11.294
gently squeeze your partner's
hands and begin soul-gazing.

03:18.094 --> 03:20.338
-I want to know details.
-No, no talking.

03:20.441 --> 03:22.547
First time, did she lead?
Did you?

03:22.650 --> 03:25.791
And geographically, I mean,
who was where? Pelvis-wise?

03:25.895 --> 03:28.311
-Why do you want details?
-This is a silent exercise.

03:28.415 --> 03:31.003
'Cause Kath was like
a big sister to me.

03:31.107 --> 03:32.557
And I've lost her.

03:32.660 --> 03:35.698
All because of you.
And I want to know why.

03:35.801 --> 03:39.736
It was when we had
that massive fight about Mum.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.394
I went there looking
for Brian and...

03:44.741 --> 03:47.088
sh-she could tell
I wanted to talk.

03:47.192 --> 03:49.090
She listened.

03:49.194 --> 03:50.678
We talked...

03:50.782 --> 03:52.301
we drank and...

03:55.856 --> 03:57.927
I just don't understand.
We were getting back on track.

03:58.030 --> 04:01.586
You asked me to marry you,
and then, out of nowhere...

04:07.523 --> 04:09.110
It's Jack.

04:09.214 --> 04:10.836
It's Jack's accident, that's
when you started pulling away.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.804
That has nothing to do with what
happened between Kath and I.

04:12.907 --> 04:14.323
I find that really hard
to believe.

04:14.426 --> 04:15.979
Why can't you just accept
that maybe we weren't working?

04:29.890 --> 04:31.443
Brian: Everything okay?

04:31.547 --> 04:33.825
Yeah.
Just getting organized.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.344
Don't get your hopes up.

04:35.447 --> 04:38.139
Ella doesn't even know
if she can come home yet.

04:38.243 --> 04:40.314
Yeah, I know.
It's good to be prepared.

04:40.418 --> 04:43.075
All that's missing are the
little choccies on her pillow.

04:43.179 --> 04:44.387
-Yeah.
-Don't bother,

04:44.491 --> 04:45.837
I'll just eat them
before she gets here.

04:45.940 --> 04:49.427
Hey, I wanted
to ask you something.

04:49.530 --> 04:52.533
You know when we started
this arrangement,

04:52.637 --> 04:55.433
you said that you didn't need
to know everyone I slept with.

04:55.536 --> 04:58.194
Are you worried Adam's gonna be
our next draft pick?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.885
I'm being serious.

04:59.989 --> 05:01.473
I'm a big boy.

05:01.577 --> 05:05.477
If something were to pop up,
I'm sure I could handle it.

05:05.581 --> 05:06.823
Okay.

05:11.725 --> 05:14.624
It's Andrew.
Wants to meet us.

05:16.937 --> 05:18.525
Andrew: I would like
the Southern Jets

05:18.628 --> 05:21.666
to start a foundation
in Jack's name.

05:21.769 --> 05:23.012
Oh...

05:23.115 --> 05:24.772
Everything's just
settled down.

05:24.876 --> 05:26.878
We don't want to spark
it up again, not yet.

05:26.981 --> 05:29.121
Jessie's having
baby number two.

05:29.225 --> 05:31.814
I want the club to be there
for her, support her.

05:31.917 --> 05:34.126
Oh, the foundation's
for the baby?

05:34.230 --> 05:35.507
And Jessie.

05:35.611 --> 05:37.164
Jessie's been under
an incredible amount

05:37.267 --> 05:39.649
of stress lately.
-We won't make a big deal of it.

05:39.753 --> 05:41.858
I just don't think thrusting her
into the spotlight again

05:41.962 --> 05:43.377
is what
she wants right now.

05:43.481 --> 05:44.758
I'll announce it quietly

05:44.861 --> 05:47.485
at the President's Luncheon,
Saturday.

05:47.588 --> 05:50.315
It's just, it's a decision that
Jessie needs to be made part of.

05:50.419 --> 05:53.767
I'll leave that conversation in
your very capable hands, Kath.

05:57.633 --> 06:00.360
That's not...

06:00.463 --> 06:03.155
That's not true.

06:03.259 --> 06:05.295
You're the...

06:05.399 --> 06:07.884
You're the one!

06:07.988 --> 06:11.578
You know what, Julia?

06:11.681 --> 06:13.718
This is pointless.

06:13.821 --> 06:15.651
Speak to my solicitor.

06:15.754 --> 06:17.584
Julia: Don't you threaten me
with your bloody solicitor,

06:17.687 --> 06:19.206
you bas--

06:19.309 --> 06:21.484
I can't speak with your wife,
I'd be struck off.

06:21.588 --> 06:22.761
Now you know
what I'm dealing with.

06:22.865 --> 06:24.867
She does sound
a little bit hostile.

06:24.970 --> 06:26.316
Hostile, yeah.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.078
And the Dalai Lama
is a little bit Buddhist.

06:30.459 --> 06:32.461
Ah, here we go again.

06:32.564 --> 06:35.533
I am still missing the deeds
to the property portfolio.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.641
What building number
is it here?

06:40.745 --> 06:42.678
224.

06:42.781 --> 06:46.992
2...2...4.

06:47.096 --> 06:49.201
Andrew, if I can just
make a suggestion...

06:49.305 --> 06:51.203
Please.
We want to avoid
going to court.

06:51.307 --> 06:53.447
You have to attend mediation,
but give it a chance,

06:53.551 --> 06:56.450
it can work.

06:56.554 --> 06:58.694
Oh, my God, this place
is so hard to find!

06:58.797 --> 07:00.316
Karlie!

07:00.420 --> 07:03.008
You remember Trav's wife?

07:03.112 --> 07:06.011
Oh, of course!
Cute office.

07:06.115 --> 07:07.461
You were saying?

07:07.565 --> 07:10.326
I don't think we'll continue
in front of Karlie.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.190
Oh.
Can I tell her?

07:12.293 --> 07:14.744
-Go on.
-Andrew and I are in love.

07:14.848 --> 07:18.299
-That is just beautiful.

07:18.403 --> 07:19.818
Congratulations.

07:19.922 --> 07:21.371
Oh, thank you so much.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.167
I was so worried you'd struggle
with us being together.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.791
What?
Why?

07:26.894 --> 07:28.206
No, no, no.

07:28.309 --> 07:31.278
No, not at all.
Not even slightly.

07:31.381 --> 07:34.039
-Oh, great.
-Lovely.

07:57.787 --> 07:59.409
Anyway, enough about me.

in the face.

08:02.930 --> 08:04.725
None of that!

08:04.829 --> 08:08.729
All right, well, let's -- let's
do a bit of a role play.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.111
So, who is Paige Dunkeley?

08:11.214 --> 08:14.839
She's an unemployed 22-year-old
with no future job prospects.

08:14.942 --> 08:18.498
No, she is a young,
energetic woman

08:18.601 --> 08:19.878
who has a passion
for teaching

08:19.982 --> 08:22.674
and a vision
to change the world.

08:22.778 --> 08:24.780

-Mm-hmm.

-Maddy: Hi!
-Oh, hello.

08:26.609 --> 08:28.335
Sorry I'm late.

08:28.438 --> 08:29.785
My meeting with Andrew
went over.

08:29.888 --> 08:32.028
And that is because the reason
that he needs

08:32.132 --> 08:34.444
an urgent hush-hush divorce
turned up at the meeting.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.689
The reason is a person.

08:37.793 --> 08:39.242
Who is it?

08:39.346 --> 08:40.727
Nope, I'm not
at liberty to say.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.107
Ooh!
We must know them.

08:42.211 --> 08:44.731
You can't bait us
and not tell.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.250
Is she blonde?
Brunette?

08:47.354 --> 08:49.080
-Boob job?
-No, no.

08:49.183 --> 08:50.875
We're not discussing this.
I'm not even here, I'm a ninja.

08:50.978 --> 08:52.773
Ah, where's Kath
when you need her?

08:52.877 --> 08:55.707
Yes, yes. Kath, ask Kath.
She'll know.

to know that bad.

10:08.159 --> 10:10.575
Of course you have, but I got to
do what's right for the team.

10:13.302 --> 10:17.478
I brought you back for your
leadership and your wisdom.

10:17.582 --> 10:21.103
This team is tighter
because you're in it.

10:21.206 --> 10:24.624
But not on the field.

10:24.727 --> 10:26.936
I just don't have room
for you right now, Trav.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.249
I understand.
Thanks.

10:46.093 --> 10:47.439
Hey!

10:47.543 --> 10:49.510
Are you free for coffee,
by chance?

10:49.614 --> 10:52.444
Um, Mum has JJ and Abi
for the next couple hours

10:52.548 --> 10:54.308
but I still got
my comfy pants on.

10:54.412 --> 10:56.725
Come on.
I'll take you to that café.

10:56.828 --> 10:58.899
You know? The one that does
the butterscotch sticky buns

10:59.003 --> 11:00.418
around the corner
from your place.

11:00.521 --> 11:02.178
What's up?

11:02.282 --> 11:03.973
Uh, Andrew's had a brain wave.

11:04.077 --> 11:07.080
He wants to start a foundation
in Jack's name.

11:07.183 --> 11:08.391
Why?

11:08.495 --> 11:10.117
You know, to honor Jack and...

11:10.221 --> 11:12.637
support you and JJ and the baby.

11:12.741 --> 11:14.328
Kath...

11:14.432 --> 11:15.916
you have to make this go away.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.435
I know, I know.

11:17.538 --> 11:19.506
But Andrew's like a dog
with a bone with this.

11:19.609 --> 11:21.335
Apparently it's the only good
thing he'll ever do

11:21.439 --> 11:24.062
with his entire life.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.788
Well, I could tell the truth.

11:28.377 --> 11:31.069
You know you'd have to
tell them everything.

11:31.173 --> 11:34.659
You would have to tell them
about Jack and Rusty.

11:36.247 --> 11:37.766
How do you know?

11:40.630 --> 11:42.322
Rusty let it slip.

11:44.462 --> 11:46.395
Okay, I'll be there
in half an hour.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.293
Great.
Okay.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.205
Well, it was
pretty heartbreaking

12:03.308 --> 12:06.691
when he first told me.

12:06.795 --> 12:09.107
Yeah, I was devastated.

12:09.211 --> 12:11.144
That's the truth.

12:14.181 --> 12:18.013
But then I realized
how much pain he'd been in.

12:18.116 --> 12:21.775
So, he gave me the time
I needed.

12:21.879 --> 12:23.708
So did Rusty.

12:25.641 --> 12:30.128
And then it became...
familiar.

12:36.307 --> 12:39.275
And I knew JJ
would never lose him.

12:39.379 --> 12:41.243
And then you met Nate.

12:41.346 --> 12:44.108
Yeah.

12:44.211 --> 12:45.937
Have you heard from him?

12:46.041 --> 12:47.697
A lot.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.285
"I miss you.
I messed up.

12:49.389 --> 12:50.977
"Give me another chance."

12:51.080 --> 12:52.702
And?

12:54.635 --> 12:57.052
Look, I know it wasn't
the most admirable move,

12:57.155 --> 12:59.986
getting cold feet, not showing
up to the engagement party...

13:00.089 --> 13:02.954
He knew what
that meant to me.

13:03.058 --> 13:06.095
But do you love him?

13:06.199 --> 13:07.614
He's the baby's father.

13:07.717 --> 13:09.892
That's not what
I asked, Jess.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.106
Here.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.840
Bloody hell!

13:26.944 --> 13:28.393
Toni, I'm Daniel.

13:28.497 --> 13:30.499
I saw you kick the winning goal
in round one.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.880
Welcome!

13:31.983 --> 13:33.640
What can I do for you?

13:33.743 --> 13:35.366
Actually, I was just
after a quick chat.

13:35.469 --> 13:37.989
-If you got the time.
-Absolutely.

13:41.303 --> 13:44.893
Yeah, I just wanted to drop in,
check out the school, meet you.

13:44.996 --> 13:47.171
Paige speaks
so highly of you.

13:47.274 --> 13:50.243
What can I say?
I run a tight ship.

13:50.346 --> 13:53.487
I wouldn't have survived
this season without her.

13:53.591 --> 13:56.007
And she probably wouldn't have
survived me without this place.

13:56.111 --> 13:59.597
So, I just wanted to say
thank you.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.738
Actually, I've got a couple
of tickets

14:02.842 --> 14:05.845
to the President's Lunch
this weekend.

14:05.948 --> 14:07.674
Thought it might be up
your alley.

14:07.777 --> 14:10.470
A few speeches,
mingle with the players.

14:13.991 --> 14:17.477
You're not trying to win
my favor are you, Mr. Fletcher?

14:17.580 --> 14:18.892
Is it working?

14:23.241 --> 14:25.726
Two months at your last school
and no reference?

14:25.830 --> 14:27.694
Yep. Yeah, when I first
moved to Melbourne,

14:27.797 --> 14:29.558
I was just picking up days
here and there,

14:29.661 --> 14:31.146
but I'm looking for
something more permanent.

14:31.249 --> 14:32.733
A step up.

14:32.837 --> 14:35.598
You were at Seagate High
with Toni and Jim.

14:35.702 --> 14:37.531
Yes.
I was.

14:37.635 --> 14:39.223
They were
very supportive.

14:41.777 --> 14:43.883
Sorry,
but they are a nightmare.

14:43.986 --> 14:47.852
Surviving Seagate High is
a reference in and of itself.

14:47.956 --> 14:49.716
Let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

14:49.819 --> 14:51.821
I'm already a fan
and I'll be very surprised

14:51.925 --> 14:54.617
if we can't find you something.
And quickly.

14:54.721 --> 14:57.586
Great.
I was a bit nervous.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.140
So, first things first,
how are we gonna describe you

15:00.244 --> 15:02.177
to your
prospective employers?

15:02.280 --> 15:03.972
Isn't that your job?

15:04.075 --> 15:05.801
I'm collaborative.

15:10.668 --> 15:14.016
A young, energetic woman
with a passion for teaching

15:14.120 --> 15:17.813
and a vision
to change the world.

15:20.298 --> 15:21.851
Funny.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.854
Great sense of humor.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.374
You know, the UK, they are
screaming out

15:27.478 --> 15:29.376
for teaching graduates
at the moment.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.276
The UK?
Oh, that sounds incredible.

15:32.379 --> 15:33.794
Knew you'd love it.

15:33.898 --> 15:35.279
Oh, no, but I'm not looking
to leave Melbourne.

15:35.382 --> 15:36.901
Not right now.

15:37.005 --> 15:38.420
No worries.

15:38.523 --> 15:42.182
There are plenty of
opportunities for you here.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.293
Ah.
Ella, how are you, sweetie?

15:49.396 --> 15:50.846
Ella: Hi, Mum.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.848
-So good to hear your voice.
-Good news.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.230
Turns out I can get home
for semester break.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.164
Oh, that's fantastic.
Can't wait to see you.

15:58.267 --> 15:59.475
Yay! Okay.

15:59.579 --> 16:01.270
I can't wait.
Love you, Mum.

16:01.374 --> 16:03.928
Love you, sweetie.
Bye.

16:09.692 --> 16:12.799
Mads, how are you?

16:16.320 --> 16:17.942
-Guess what?
-Paige: What?

16:20.462 --> 16:26.399
I have won the clearance,
run it to the 50, kicked to you,

16:26.502 --> 16:28.918
25 out, directly in front.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.713
Why would you
kick it to me?

16:30.817 --> 16:32.922
What I'm saying is, Paige,
what I'm trying to say is,

16:33.026 --> 16:35.649
I've done the legwork for ya.
With Toni. Your boss.

16:35.753 --> 16:37.686
Ex-boss, or,
and future boss.

16:37.789 --> 16:41.138
When you knock her socks off
at the President's Lunch.

16:41.241 --> 16:43.933
Is this still part of the footy
analogy I don't understand?

16:44.037 --> 16:46.453
Nah, I'm being serious.
I gave her a couple of tickets.

16:46.557 --> 16:50.492
And I reckon she's gonna
give you another shot.

16:50.595 --> 16:52.701
What?

16:52.804 --> 16:55.290
Why didn't you
talk to me first?

16:55.393 --> 16:58.086
'Cause I wanted
to surprise you.

16:58.189 --> 17:01.503
In a way that didn't make
your face do that.

17:01.606 --> 17:03.298
I thought you wanted
a full-time gig.

17:03.401 --> 17:05.645
I did.
I-I do.

17:05.748 --> 17:08.061
Yeah, well, a thank you
might be nice.

17:11.478 --> 17:13.101
Thanks.

in the same bar at the same time

17:38.609 --> 17:40.818
to meet Maddy?
-Maddy.

Would you just give me a chance
to tell them myself?

18:17.682 --> 18:19.995
I didn't get any warning.

JJ, and the baby?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.495
That's great.

It's only because he thinks
the baby's Jack's.

18:39.601 --> 18:42.190
Jess, you got nothing
to feel guilty about.

18:42.293 --> 18:44.640
You don't have to explain
your life to strangers.

18:44.744 --> 18:46.918
You did.
Yeah, look
how that turned out.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.130
I want to tell the truth

18:51.233 --> 18:53.718
about Nate being the father,
not Jack.

18:53.822 --> 18:55.168
People are gonna
make assumptions,

18:55.272 --> 18:56.963
they're gonna think
that you cheated on him.

Jessie, when I spoke
to the media,

19:12.220 --> 19:15.015
I was talking about me.

I can't bring this baby

Russ, it deserves
better than that.

19:22.402 --> 19:25.302
Have you spoke to Nate
about this?

19:30.617 --> 19:32.343
Maddy: Are you kidding me?!

19:32.447 --> 19:35.312
How long's a while?

19:35.415 --> 19:36.934
After everything
you've done,

19:37.037 --> 19:38.832
everything we've done
for that club.

19:38.936 --> 19:40.696
Maybe I should just retire.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.872
Oh, bullshit.
You are not retiring.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.254
-I thought you'd be happy.
-Why?!

19:46.357 --> 19:47.910
'Cause you want
me to retire.

19:48.014 --> 19:49.809
Not like this.

19:49.912 --> 19:51.707
Those men think they can click
their fingers

19:51.811 --> 19:53.951
and dictate the terms
of other people's lives?

19:54.054 --> 19:55.677
They run a football club,
for God's sake.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.368
You have busted
your arse, Trav.

19:57.472 --> 19:59.094
We've thrown our family up
in the air

19:59.198 --> 20:02.511
all for Brian fucking Rickards
to say there's no space for you?

20:02.615 --> 20:05.756
You deserve to go out

20:12.521 --> 20:13.867

-Yeah.

-I know I let you down...
-Nate...

20:24.775 --> 20:26.259
we're having
a baby together.

20:26.363 --> 20:27.985
I'm not here for me.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.130
Do you want to be a part
of this child's life?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.166
Yes, of course I do.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.066
Good, I want you to be.

20:40.169 --> 20:41.757
But that would mean being
okay with people

20:41.861 --> 20:43.414
knowing you're the father.

20:50.179 --> 20:51.871
You don't have to decide
right now.

21:04.849 --> 21:08.163
Ah, am I overdressed?
Should've checked for myself.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.199
I trusted Toni.
She said to frock it up.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.926
But I can see in your eyes,
I've over-frocked.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.928
Is it too late to duck home
and get changed or...

21:15.032 --> 21:17.621
You look great.

21:17.724 --> 21:20.451
I wasn't -- I wasn't fishing
about the clothes.

21:20.555 --> 21:22.004
I was, I still am.

21:22.108 --> 21:23.592
How much do you hate
the bow tie?

21:23.696 --> 21:26.112
I like the bow tie.Oh, that was very lukewarm.

21:26.215 --> 21:28.287
No, I'm just, I'm surprised to
see you, I was expecting Toni.

21:28.390 --> 21:29.736
Ah, she's in the car.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.429
Something about her dress
needing adjustment

21:32.532 --> 21:35.294
every time she turns
through the hip.

21:35.397 --> 21:37.054
Great tactic, by the way.

21:37.157 --> 21:38.814
Surprised you didn't play
the Southern Jets card earlier.

21:38.918 --> 21:40.333
Ah, no.
It was Dan's idea.

21:40.437 --> 21:42.473
He thought he was helping
in his own misguided way.

21:42.577 --> 21:45.511
Well, it's not misguided
if it works.

21:45.614 --> 21:47.547

don't surface pre-game.

22:04.702 --> 22:06.635
-They're in lockdown.
-I'm already drinking.

22:09.535 --> 22:11.019
Tahlia Woods.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.918
Or should I say
Tahlia Marrello?

22:14.022 --> 22:16.024
-No.
-Good on you!

22:16.127 --> 22:18.129
It's archaic, really,
giving up your name.

22:18.233 --> 22:22.651
I didn't change my name when I
married my wife, why should you?

22:22.755 --> 22:24.964
Um, Tahlia, this is

22:25.067 --> 22:26.414
my old boss, Toni.

22:26.517 --> 22:28.381
Colleague, friend.

22:28.485 --> 22:30.556
Paige talks about you
all the time.

22:30.659 --> 22:32.420
I really don't.

22:32.523 --> 22:33.697
And this is Brody.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.665
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.874
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna say this,

22:38.978 --> 22:44.086
but you really are more
attractive in real life.

22:44.190 --> 22:45.605
Thank you.

22:45.709 --> 22:47.089
Uh, drinks?

22:47.193 --> 22:50.127
-Champagne.
-I'll get them. Brody, help me.

22:52.647 --> 22:54.303
I thought she sacked you.
Why is she here?

22:54.407 --> 22:55.615
Yeah, Dan thought
it might help

22:55.719 --> 22:57.376
if she rubbed shoulders
with the right people.

22:57.479 --> 22:59.274
Well, she can rub my shoulders
if it helps you out,

22:59.378 --> 23:01.863
but sucking up to her
is not your only option.

23:01.966 --> 23:03.658
How was
the recruitment meeting?

23:03.761 --> 23:06.315
-Oh, yeah. Really good.
-Listen, you are killing it!

23:06.419 --> 23:08.835
You smashed the meeting,
you're looking banging, and PS,

23:08.939 --> 23:10.941
you know that Brody's
sweet on you, yeah?

23:11.044 --> 23:13.495
No, he's not.

23:13.599 --> 23:15.324
He barely looked at me.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.188
No, he's just
a colleague.

23:17.292 --> 23:19.501
He would happily give you his
kidney if you asked him nicely.

23:31.858 --> 23:33.481
He's handling this
better than I am.

23:33.584 --> 23:35.275
Oh, you can't let it get to you.
It's not --

23:35.379 --> 23:37.450
-Do not say it's not personal.
-But it's really not.

23:37.554 --> 23:39.003
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

23:39.107 --> 23:40.488
Now I'm stuck handling
Andrew's divorce.

23:40.591 --> 23:41.903
Just try not
to think about it.

23:42.006 --> 23:43.283
Instead,
you can give us

23:43.387 --> 23:44.906
another clue about
who Andrew's dating.

23:45.009 --> 23:46.494
Wait, Andrew has
a lady friend?

23:46.597 --> 23:49.186
Yes, and Maddy knows,
and she won't tell us.

23:49.289 --> 23:50.705
We've been spitballing back
and forth,

23:50.808 --> 23:52.292
but so far we've
come up with nothing.

23:52.396 --> 23:54.571
Nada.
Not a single decent suggestion.

23:54.674 --> 23:55.882
Give us a clue.

23:55.986 --> 23:57.574
I am a vault.
You will not break me.

23:57.677 --> 23:59.990
-It's only a matter of time.
-Hmph.

24:00.093 --> 24:02.406
Oh, look, there's Kath.
Kath!

24:02.510 --> 24:04.546
Hey, ladies.

24:04.650 --> 24:06.479
I see we're all locked
and loaded, ready for the game.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.792
Except for those of us
who can't. Sorry, Jess.

24:08.895 --> 24:10.034
Yeah, right.

24:10.138 --> 24:12.036
Thank you
for organizing drinks.

24:12.140 --> 24:15.281
Hmm.
Did you have a nice time?

24:15.384 --> 24:19.250
Yes, it was --
it was very pleasant.

24:19.354 --> 24:22.253
Sorry, I would've been there,
but I sensed a bit of tension.

24:22.357 --> 24:23.841
Um, what tension?

24:23.945 --> 24:26.292
Nah, there was no tension --
Thank you.

24:26.395 --> 24:28.501
Just a bit
of a misunderstanding.

24:28.605 --> 24:30.296
-Anyway, cheers.
-If you'll excuse me.

24:30.399 --> 24:32.367
Okay, wait.
Wh-What's going on?

24:32.471 --> 24:35.128
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-No, no, n-n-no. I mean here.

24:35.232 --> 24:37.717
Who did what to whom,
and in what order?

24:38.787 --> 24:40.824
Karlie: Oh, hi!

24:40.927 --> 24:43.447
-Ah, how are you?
-No fuckin' way.

24:43.551 --> 24:45.484
Is that Karlie?

24:45.587 --> 24:48.072
Holy shit!

24:48.176 --> 24:49.729
Are Andrew
and Karlie dating?

24:49.833 --> 24:51.628
I'm not here, I'm not seeing
this, this is not happening.

24:51.731 --> 24:53.492
You could've given us
a heads up.

24:53.595 --> 24:55.735
-You knew?!
-I couldn't exactly tell you.

24:55.839 --> 24:57.426
You could've
dropped a clue.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.704
Like what, exactly?

24:58.807 --> 25:00.119
She dated Rusty.

25:00.222 --> 25:01.500
That is really obvious.

25:01.603 --> 25:03.571
She went to the press
about me and Russ.

25:03.674 --> 25:06.056
No, I will not be
blamed for this.

25:06.159 --> 25:07.920
I didn't ask
for this knowledge.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.907
What are you looking at?
We've got a game to win, boys!

25:31.702 --> 25:33.601
All right!

25:37.639 --> 25:39.296
Hi, guys!

25:39.399 --> 25:41.091
Karlie, you look...

25:41.194 --> 25:42.506
I know.
I know.

25:42.610 --> 25:44.163
I've gone for the older
lady's lines.

25:44.266 --> 25:46.441
Simple, timeless, but then
I've paired it with my face

25:46.545 --> 25:49.893
just to really lift it up
and make it all feel fresh.

25:49.996 --> 25:51.964
Kind of a mash-up
of the old and the new.

25:52.067 --> 25:54.104
Like you and Andrew?

25:54.207 --> 25:57.521
So, how long have you
two been a thing?

25:57.625 --> 26:00.179
Well, we're both going through
a pretty difficult time.

26:00.282 --> 26:01.732
You know, we're both going
through a breakup,

26:01.836 --> 26:04.217
we're both Saturn returning,
my first his second.

26:04.321 --> 26:06.426
But it's so funny looking back.

26:06.530 --> 26:09.015
We always seemed to gravitate
towards each other.

26:09.119 --> 26:11.293
'Cause, you know, soul mates
are like magnets,

26:11.397 --> 26:13.572
and Andrew is my fridge.

26:13.675 --> 26:15.056
Kath: No, that's
really beautiful.

26:15.159 --> 26:18.266
But how long ago
did you actually get together?

26:18.369 --> 26:20.544
I d-- I don't think
that's relevant.

26:20.648 --> 26:23.064
Like, before or after Julia?

26:23.167 --> 26:24.755
-Who?
-His wife.

26:24.859 --> 26:26.688
Oh! Oh, yeah.
No, that had ended.

26:26.792 --> 26:28.414
Right.
Was Julia aware of that?

26:28.517 --> 26:30.140
I know, poor thing.

26:30.243 --> 26:32.487
But, you know,
the passion had just gone.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.386
It had run its course,
it's as simple as that.

26:35.490 --> 26:38.355
Look, I just want to say that
when Rusty and I split,

26:38.458 --> 26:40.288
I was in a really dark place,

26:40.391 --> 26:45.604
and I did and said and posted
things that I am not proud of.

26:45.707 --> 26:49.608
But I want to let you all know
that I'm not angry anymore.

26:49.711 --> 26:52.403
-You think we give a shit?
-It's not the place, Jess.

26:52.507 --> 26:55.096
I-I know -- I know it must be
really weird for you guys.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.271
Especially you, given that,
you know, I'm -- I'm higher up.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.790
Well, I'm gonna stop you
right there

26:59.894 --> 27:01.896
before you say
something you'll regret.

27:01.999 --> 27:03.483
Andrew: If everyone could
find their way

27:03.587 --> 27:04.864
to their seats, please.

27:04.968 --> 27:06.728
Andrew's voice has never sounded
so sweet.

27:15.047 --> 27:17.118
Thank you so much
for being here.

27:17.221 --> 27:22.123
It's terrific to see so many old
and new faces here today.

27:22.226 --> 27:26.472
I'm very proud to announce that
the Southern Jets Football Club

27:26.575 --> 27:31.891
will be launching
the Jack Davies Foundation.

27:34.169 --> 27:36.309
-This is weird.
-Mm, Andrew's idea.

27:36.413 --> 27:38.518
-Doesn't sound like him.
-My thoughts exactly.

27:38.622 --> 27:41.729
This foundation will honor
Jack's memory,

27:41.832 --> 27:46.388
but more importantly,
will support a young family

27:46.492 --> 27:49.460
who tragically
lost their father.

27:49.564 --> 27:53.154
Did she know about this?

27:53.257 --> 27:55.708
-None of us did.
-I'd like to thank the club

27:55.812 --> 27:59.091
and all our sponsors
for getting behind it.

27:59.194 --> 28:03.647
And now, I would like to invite
the extraordinary Jessie Davies

28:03.751 --> 28:05.925
to say a few words.

28:06.029 --> 28:08.790
-We're gonna let this happen?
-Just listen.

28:08.894 --> 28:10.447
Jessie: Thank you.

28:10.550 --> 28:12.345
And thank you, everyone,
for your support

28:12.449 --> 28:15.038
over the last few months.

28:15.141 --> 28:18.558
Jack believed that everyone
deserved a fair shot.

28:18.662 --> 28:23.632
So, in his honor, I will be
donating all funds raised

28:23.736 --> 28:26.187
by the foundation to women
and children's shelters

28:26.290 --> 28:27.498
across the country.

28:27.602 --> 28:29.397
-Crowd: Aw!
-So that single mothers,

28:29.500 --> 28:32.469
just like me, can provide a
better life for their children.

28:32.572 --> 28:33.850
Three cheers
for Jessie!

28:33.953 --> 28:36.128
-Hip hip!
-Hooray!

28:36.231 --> 28:37.612
-Hip hip!
-Hooray!

28:37.716 --> 28:39.856
-Hip hip!
-Hooray!

28:39.959 --> 28:41.236
Oh, you are good.

28:46.794 --> 28:48.450
Commentator: Brian Rickards
finally got

28:48.554 --> 28:50.521
those match-ups right,
and it wasn't convincing

28:50.625 --> 28:52.144
by the Southern Jets,
but a win's a win.

28:52.247 --> 28:53.524
Commentator #2:
You're right, JV.

28:53.628 --> 28:55.285
But Dan Fletcher was clearly
off his game

28:55.388 --> 28:58.737
in what only could be described
as a lackluster performance.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.324
You heading upstairs?

29:00.428 --> 29:01.740
No, I think
I'll go home, mate.

29:01.843 --> 29:03.224
-All right.
-See ya.

29:03.327 --> 29:05.744
- Hey.
-How you doing?

29:05.847 --> 29:08.091
-Hey, mate.
-Hey.

29:08.194 --> 29:11.439
I, uh, got a couple
of things to say.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.854
Go ahead.

29:12.958 --> 29:14.614
You asked --

29:14.718 --> 29:18.549
No, you pleaded with me to stay
and play another year.

29:18.653 --> 29:22.761
You shook my hand at my best
mate's wake to get me back.

29:24.832 --> 29:27.282
You used my grief
to your advantage,

29:27.386 --> 29:30.492
and on some level,
you must've known.

29:30.596 --> 29:32.356
Listen, Trav, I --

29:32.460 --> 29:35.118
I'm not finished.

29:35.221 --> 29:40.640
I gave you everything I had
for 12 years.

29:44.368 --> 29:49.718
I gave you weeks and months
that weren't mine to give.

29:52.618 --> 29:57.554
I put my marriage
and my kids on hold...

29:57.657 --> 29:59.763
'cause you promised me
another chance.

30:04.009 --> 30:07.322
Doesn't mean I'm never
gonna play you again.

30:07.426 --> 30:09.911
We both know you won't.

30:18.747 --> 30:21.302
Toni: My wife's Antonia.
I'm Toni, short for Tashini.

30:21.405 --> 30:24.753
It's I, T-O-N-I.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.686
What was going through your mind
in the third quarter?

30:26.790 --> 30:28.688
Ah, I see you got
your poster.

30:28.792 --> 30:30.656
I guess that means
I'm out of a job.

30:30.759 --> 30:32.727
Ah, it was just a joke
that Brody made that

30:32.831 --> 30:36.558
once you got that, uh,
wouldn't get any more work.

30:36.662 --> 30:38.629
Tahlia's looking for you.

30:38.733 --> 30:40.217
Cheers, Paige.

30:40.321 --> 30:42.599
Toni, it's a pleasure.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.052
Uh, hungry?

30:47.155 --> 30:49.330
I am, but where's
the ladies' room?

30:49.433 --> 30:50.676
Through there.

30:50.779 --> 30:52.298
In case I miss something.

30:52.402 --> 30:55.094
Well, take a photo
or a video!

30:57.786 --> 31:00.065
Like a kid at Disneyland.

31:00.168 --> 31:02.274
Hey!

31:02.377 --> 31:03.827
Hey!

31:03.931 --> 31:06.312
Dan, this is Brody.
Brody, Dan.

31:06.416 --> 31:08.487
Dan!
Great to finally meet you!

31:08.590 --> 31:10.282
Great game.
Yeah, no worries.

31:10.385 --> 31:11.835
Hey, where --
where's Toni?

31:11.939 --> 31:13.181
She's around.

31:13.285 --> 31:14.769
Yeah, she needs
constant supervision.

31:16.150 --> 31:17.841
So, Brody,
what do you do?

31:17.945 --> 31:20.499
Oh, I'm a...

31:20.602 --> 31:22.294
Excuse me.
I'm a teacher.

31:22.397 --> 31:23.605
We work together.

31:23.709 --> 31:25.090
This is Brody,
my friend from school.

31:25.193 --> 31:27.057
Oh, right, of course.
Sorry, mate.

31:27.161 --> 31:28.817
My head's still in the game.
Nice to meet ya.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.681
Yeah, great.

31:30.785 --> 31:32.476
Um...well,
thanks for the tickets.

31:32.580 --> 31:33.892
Yeah, yeah, no,
no worries.

31:33.995 --> 31:36.687
-Hey, Dan!
-Sorry, guys.

31:36.791 --> 31:37.896
I got to take off.

31:37.999 --> 31:40.001
Yeah.
No, of course.

31:40.105 --> 31:41.313
H-He's just --

31:41.416 --> 31:43.798
No, honestly, don't
even worry about it.

31:48.596 --> 31:50.460
-Karlie!
-Hi!

31:50.563 --> 31:53.981
You know, you have had
quite the effect on our Andrew.

31:54.084 --> 31:56.673
You swoop in,
and he's a changed man.

31:56.776 --> 31:58.399
Andrew is, um...

31:58.502 --> 32:00.021
very open with me.

32:00.125 --> 32:03.991
-Is he?
-Not just sexually.

32:04.094 --> 32:05.682
We talk about everything.

32:05.785 --> 32:07.684
My thumbprint
opens his phone.

32:07.787 --> 32:09.168
Ah.

32:09.272 --> 32:11.619
So, you're the mastermind
behind all of this?

32:11.722 --> 32:12.965
Behind...what?

32:13.069 --> 32:15.174
-The Jack Davies Foundation.
-Oh!

32:15.278 --> 32:16.520
No, no, I had nothing
to do with that.

32:16.624 --> 32:18.108
That was --
That was all Andrew.

32:18.212 --> 32:20.835
He's very passionate about doing
all he can for Jessie.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.769
-Is he?
-Yeah.

32:23.872 --> 32:26.220
I -- I got to go.
Andy wants me.

32:26.323 --> 32:28.601
-Okay. See you later.
-Bye-bye.

32:28.705 --> 32:31.466
Kath...

32:31.570 --> 32:33.227
can we have a word?

32:40.855 --> 32:43.651
I just wanted to apologize.

32:43.754 --> 32:45.101
I was out of line.

32:45.204 --> 32:48.518
I put pressure on you
and it was wrong.

32:48.621 --> 32:50.761
I appreciate that.

32:50.865 --> 32:53.695
I mean, what the fuck
was I thinking?

32:53.799 --> 32:56.112
I wasn't.

32:56.215 --> 32:57.837
But, uh, you were.

33:00.116 --> 33:02.221
You're welcome.

33:02.325 --> 33:03.982
Hey.

33:06.639 --> 33:10.057
Before you hear it
through anyone else...

33:10.160 --> 33:12.128
I'm ending things
with Tahlia.

33:12.231 --> 33:14.026
We tried
but we can't fix it.

33:16.442 --> 33:18.789
Oh, you can't
be sure of that.

33:18.893 --> 33:21.689
Yeah.
No, I-I am.

33:23.932 --> 33:27.039
I just want you to know
that it's not your fault.

33:27.143 --> 33:29.007
Or Tahlia's.

33:35.047 --> 33:37.601
Hey.

33:53.617 --> 33:55.136
I think you've got to
roll the dice more.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.897
And what the hell is going on
in front of goal?

33:58.001 --> 34:00.521
Why don't we organize Connor
to come to your school?

34:00.624 --> 34:02.799
Have a chat to the kids,
maybe even run a clinic?

34:02.902 --> 34:04.973
That would be
incredible!

34:05.077 --> 34:07.493
Oh, my God. You're gorgeous.
Consider it done.

34:07.597 --> 34:10.565
I've got to find Brody.
Wait till he hears about this!

34:14.155 --> 34:15.674
I just thought you might
want to know

34:15.777 --> 34:18.056
that your captain has been
fucking your wife.

34:29.377 --> 34:30.930
-How did Maddy take it?

34:31.034 --> 34:34.175
Let's just say, if you see Brian
speaking to Maddy, just run.

34:34.279 --> 34:36.798
You know, aside
from being sidelined,

34:36.902 --> 34:38.352
you are a lucky bastard.

34:38.455 --> 34:40.112
Ooh, I know.

34:40.216 --> 34:43.564
How's Jessie, redirecting
the donations to a charity?

34:43.667 --> 34:45.600
These women are...

34:45.704 --> 34:46.843
something else.

34:46.946 --> 34:48.845
-That's you.

34:48.948 --> 34:50.985
Yeah, they sure are.

34:54.989 --> 34:57.681
You...
seeing someone special?

35:03.101 --> 35:05.344
-Yeah, I was.
-Hmm?

35:09.486 --> 35:11.247
Me and Jack were together.

35:16.976 --> 35:19.669
Uh...

35:19.772 --> 35:22.292
Like, togethertogether?

35:24.501 --> 35:26.020
Yeah.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.336
D-Did Jessie know?

35:38.170 --> 35:40.448
W-Why didn't you tell me?

35:40.552 --> 35:42.312
He didn't want
to tell anyone.

35:42.416 --> 35:44.349
I-I'm not just anyone.

35:47.524 --> 35:48.801
No, you're not.

35:52.495 --> 35:55.049
I'm so sorry, mate.
I...

35:57.983 --> 35:59.812
Know you are.

36:08.856 --> 36:11.030
You nearly ready to go?

36:13.723 --> 36:15.207
I'll drive.

36:26.114 --> 36:29.083
Wh-What --
Why are you do quiet?

36:29.187 --> 36:31.361
"What do you do
for a living?"

36:31.465 --> 36:33.329
What?

36:33.432 --> 36:34.778
You embarrassed me.

36:34.882 --> 36:36.263
I-I didn't know
he was gonna be there.

36:36.366 --> 36:37.678
I'm sorry,
it was out of context.

36:37.781 --> 36:39.093
Brody,
his name's Brody.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.095
And he's the one person,
aside from you,

36:41.199 --> 36:42.579
who's been there for me
since I moved to Melbourne.

36:42.683 --> 36:44.788
-What, so I haven't been there?
-Aside from you.

36:44.892 --> 36:46.687
But even then.

36:46.790 --> 36:48.067
Are you joking?

36:48.171 --> 36:49.586
No, you haven't exactly
kept your opinions of me

36:49.690 --> 36:51.726
to yourself
these last couple of months.

36:51.830 --> 36:54.660
When was the last time that
you asked me how I was going?

36:54.764 --> 36:56.904
You know, this move,
it hasn't onlyaffected you.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.078
You have footy, the club,
your career.

36:59.182 --> 37:01.288
Yeah, pressure,
expectation, stress.

37:01.391 --> 37:03.151
You know, I talk about Brody
all of the time,

37:03.255 --> 37:05.326
and when you finally meet him --
-Where is this coming from?

37:05.430 --> 37:06.845
I can't tell you
how many ways

37:06.948 --> 37:08.916
I've tried to blend
into your background.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.883
The fans and players
I've had to smile at,

37:10.987 --> 37:12.506
the jokes
I've had to laugh at,

37:12.609 --> 37:15.474
and you cannot even remember
my onefriend's name.

37:15.578 --> 37:17.614
-Yeah, I was focused on Toni.
-I don't give a shit about Toni.

37:17.718 --> 37:19.202
I don't even know if I want
that job anymore.

37:19.306 --> 37:20.617
What, you're gonna
do that online thing?

37:20.721 --> 37:22.516
I don't know, maybe!
What does it matter what I do?

37:22.619 --> 37:24.897
What is that
supposed to mean?

37:25.001 --> 37:27.003
You know what?
I'm over it.

37:27.106 --> 37:28.970
-Teaching?
-No.

37:29.074 --> 37:30.765
This.

37:49.508 --> 37:52.718
You didn't come in
last night.

37:52.822 --> 37:55.928
Had a lot to think about.

37:56.032 --> 37:57.723
Is everything okay?

37:57.827 --> 37:59.415
Is it true?

38:02.245 --> 38:04.351
Did you sleep with Connor?

38:05.973 --> 38:07.664
Yes.

38:07.768 --> 38:09.390
How did we get to a place

38:09.494 --> 38:11.668
where you would think that
that is okay?

38:11.772 --> 38:14.015
-It was a mistake.
-Yeah.

38:16.224 --> 38:17.950
How many times?

38:19.227 --> 38:20.988
Twice.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.784
I didn't take you
for a slow learner, Kath.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.303
He wasn't in
a good place.

38:25.406 --> 38:27.097
I was trying
to help him.

38:27.201 --> 38:28.513
You're smarter than that.

38:28.616 --> 38:30.342
Brian, I thought
he was gonna break.

38:34.967 --> 38:37.280
So, instead,
you broke me.

38:48.222 --> 38:50.707
-Is that lube?
-Yes. Yes, it is.

38:50.811 --> 38:52.468
Ooh.

38:52.571 --> 38:54.677
-Gross! Wh--

38:56.575 --> 38:57.990
Here we are.

39:00.407 --> 39:02.926
There's a leg
and a foot.

39:04.963 --> 39:06.378
Probably worth
a bit already.

39:06.482 --> 39:08.967
I mean, if it's got your leg
and not Nate's.

39:11.728 --> 39:14.490
Have we made a decision
about the sex?

39:14.593 --> 39:16.457
What do you reckon?

39:16.561 --> 39:19.253
Me?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.773
Well, I figure you'll be
hanging around a bit.

39:21.876 --> 39:23.291
You may as well weigh in.

39:25.777 --> 39:28.883
All right.

39:28.987 --> 39:31.541
Yeah, I want to know.

39:31.645 --> 39:33.094
It's a girl!

39:33.198 --> 39:35.614
-It's a girl!
-Oh, my God.

39:35.718 --> 39:36.926
Wow.

39:37.029 --> 39:38.134
Oh!

39:38.237 --> 39:39.791
Jess.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.180
You didn't answer your phone.

39:50.284 --> 39:52.873
I wasn't available.

39:52.976 --> 39:55.082
You didn't come home
last night.

39:55.185 --> 39:57.084
Did you want me to worry?

39:57.187 --> 39:59.880
-I did.
-Right.

40:12.064 --> 40:15.758
I want to play
the game of truth.

40:15.861 --> 40:17.035
Okay.

40:17.138 --> 40:18.692
When did you fall in love
with me?

40:18.795 --> 40:21.798
-You know when.
-I want to know if you do.

40:21.902 --> 40:24.076
First summer
we went away together.

40:24.180 --> 40:26.147
Bali.

40:26.251 --> 40:28.771
What scares you more
than anything?

40:28.874 --> 40:30.358
Letting you down.

40:32.982 --> 40:35.536
Letting the club down.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.952
Obviously,
not in that order.

40:40.058 --> 40:41.646
Yeah.

40:41.749 --> 40:43.302
You're right.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.376
Why did you
propose to me?

40:48.480 --> 40:50.793
'Cause you wanted me to.

40:53.071 --> 40:54.417
You didn't have to.

40:57.316 --> 40:58.801
Yeah, I did.

41:03.288 --> 41:07.085
You managed every inch
of our relationship, Tahlia.

41:13.091 --> 41:14.817
So, what happens now?

41:17.405 --> 41:18.959
I can't do this.
