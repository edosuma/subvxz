ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.581
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.614 --> 00:15.483
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.516 --> 00:17.051
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.085 --> 00:19.187
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.422
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

AN INCREASE

00:43.611 --> 00:45.646

NOT JUST ROOFIES,
BUT ANTIANXIETY MEDICATIONS,

00:49.283 --> 00:51.452
BETA-BLOCKERS.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.288
SURVIVORS SUFFER

00:54.322 --> 00:55.423
GUILT, SELF-BLAME--

00:55.456 --> 00:58.826
ALL OF WHICH MAKE THEM HESITANT

02:35.556 --> 02:38.492
1992, I WON IT

02:38.526 --> 02:39.893
- WOW.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.363
- NOW, SEDUCE THE AUDIENCE.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.866
LET THEM KNOW

02:49.603 --> 02:51.705
- SRI LANKA,
IN A HEARTBEAT.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.974
- I WOULD LIKE
TO VISIT PARIS SOMEDAY.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.477
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN?
NOW, THAT'S A CRIME.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.579
- SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.581
- HEY, I LIVE
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS UPTOWN.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.584
UM, THERE'S A BISTRO.
I'M A REGULAR.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.353
USUALLY EATING BY MYSELF.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.588
- OH, YOU'RE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS?

03:07.621 --> 03:10.658
- WHAT WAS THAT
STANLEY ELKIN QUOTE?

03:10.691 --> 03:15.629
"THE PECULIAR DIGNITY
OF MEN SEEN EATING ALONE."

03:15.663 --> 03:17.431
ANYWAY, DINNER?

03:17.465 --> 03:19.900
- I'M ACTUALLY STILL ON DUTY.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.936
AND BESIDES, I'M A COP.
YOU'RE A D.A.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.739
ISN'T THAT A CONFLICT
OF INTEREST WAITING TO HAPPEN?

03:25.773 --> 03:29.009
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.644
I GET IT.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.448
GOOD NIGHT.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.517
- GOOD NIGHT.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.888
- HEY, UH...

03:40.921 --> 03:43.524
DON'T WAIT TOO LONG

03:54.902 --> 03:56.870
- MISS.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.806
MISS?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.309
ARE YOU OKAY?

04:15.656 --> 04:18.025
- HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.760
HEY!

04:27.701 --> 04:30.438
- SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN WE FOUND HER.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.374
VOMIT ON HER CLOTHES--
ALCOHOL, PROBABLY DRUGS.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.942
NO PURSE, NO WALLET.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.678
- NO STOCKINGS?
IN THIS WEATHER?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.580
SHOES ARE
ON THE WRONG FEET.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.781
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.650
GO WITH,
CALL IF SHE COMES TO.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.518
AND MAKE SURE THEY BAG
THAT COAT.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.720
- I TOLD THEM.
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.955
I THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.323
- EXCUSE ME?

04:49.357 --> 04:52.326
- SHE WAS LYING THERE.
SHE WASN'T MOVING.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.694
I THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.397
- LET'S GO, CREEP BOY.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.913
- WHAT?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.648
HE THOUGHT
SHE WAS DEAD?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.750
THIRTY YEARS IN,
THAT'S A NEW ONE.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.785
- NAME'S JOSE SILVA, 20.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.721
FOUR VICS HAVE ALREADY
PICKED HIM OUT--

05:53.754 --> 05:55.155
TEN MORE ON THEIR WAY.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.625
- YEAH, BUT THE OTHER WOMEN
WERE ON SUBWAYS, GRIND AND GO.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.759
THIS IS ATTEMPTED RAPE.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.127
- HE'S ESCALATING.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.762
- SHE WAS PASSED OUT--
EASY TARGET.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.464
- WHAT'S THE STATUS
OF OUR JANE DOE?

06:03.497 --> 06:05.466
- SHE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS
AT MERCY HOSPITAL,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.067
NO MATCH
WITH MISSING PERSONS.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.537
- BENSON, AMARO, SEE WHERE
WE ARE ON THE RAPE KIT.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.739
YOU TWO,
GET MR. SILVA'S CONFESSION.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.508
LET'S MOVE THIS
OFF OUR PLATE.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.511
- OKAY, WE TALKED
TO THE D.A.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.781
THINKING SOMEBODY'S DEAD
IS NOT A DEFENSE FOR RAPE.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.516
- OH, I'M NO RAPIST.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.051
- WHY NOT,
'CAUSE YOU GOT CAUGHT?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.919
YOU'RE STILL GOING DOWN
FOR THE ATTEMPT.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.821
- AND THE GRINDS.
WE GOT DNA EVIDENCE

06:27.855 --> 06:30.491
OFF NINE OF THE OTHER
WOMEN'S CLOTHES.

06:30.524 --> 06:34.094
- OKAY, I'M NOT SAYING
I HAVEN'T DONE THINGS.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.465
I SEE A WOMAN, SHE'S WEARING
SOMETHING SOFT OR FURRY.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.501
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.
BUT NO RAPE.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.636
- COME ON, THIS GIRL--

06:42.670 --> 06:44.638
HER UNDERWEAR,
HER STOCKINGS WERE GONE.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.039
YOU WERE THAT CLOSE.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.443
- I DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT NO PANTIES.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.145
MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE
MESSED HER UP, MAN.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.215
I JUST LIKE SHEARLING.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.685
CHECK HER COAT.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.852
- YOUR JANE DOE
HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.

06:58.886 --> 07:02.856
PRELIM TOX SCREEN SHOWS ALCOHOL,
BENADRYL, AND QUAALUDES.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.792
THAT COMBO WILL KNOCK
ANYONE ON THEIR ASS.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.461
- LUDES--THAT'S OLD SCHOOL
FOR SOMEONE HER AGE.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.530
- ANY SIGN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?
[cell phone chimes]

07:09.563 --> 07:12.132
- GRAY PUBIC HAIRS
AND SEMEN ON HER BREASTS.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.034
- GRAY?
THE SUSPECT'S 20.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.538
- AND HE CLAIMS HE ONLY
WORKED HER COAT.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.740
- OH, JUST GETTING TO THAT.
I FOUND SEMEN THERE TOO.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.042
I DID A.B.O. TYPING
ON BOTH SAMPLES.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.878
ONE'S FROM A SECRETOR.
ONE'S NOT.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.514
- SORRY?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.048
- IT'S PRE-DNA, AMARO.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.050
SHE'S SAYING
THAT THERE'S TWO DONORS.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.053
THE GRINDER WAS JUST
AN OPPORTUNIST.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.155
SO WHOEVER GAVE HER
THE QUAALUDES

07:35.188 --> 07:37.891
ASSAULTED HER FIRST.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.663
- MY NAME'S MALLORY JENNER.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.197
AM I OKAY?

07:44.231 --> 07:47.267
- YOU MAY HAVE BEEN DRUGGED.

07:47.300 --> 07:51.071
YOU WERE DRINKING.
THAT WAS A BAD COMBO.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.674
- WE FOUND YOU
IN CENTRAL PARK, MALLORY.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.510
YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU GOT THERE?

07:56.544 --> 07:59.146
- NO.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.649
WH-WHAT WAS I WEARING?

08:01.682 --> 08:04.184
- A BLACK SKIRT--IT WAS SHORT--

08:04.217 --> 08:06.654
A WHITE SWEATER
AND SHORT BLACK BOOTS.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.855
- OH, MY LUCKY
AUDITION OUTFIT.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.657
I'M AN ACTRESS.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.692
- OKAY, UH...

08:11.725 --> 08:14.928
AN AUDITION FOR A PLAY,
A TV SHOW?

08:14.962 --> 08:18.799
- I...

08:18.832 --> 08:21.635
DID SOMETHING BAD
HAPPEN TO ME?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.136
- A MAN IN THE PARK
WAS ATTACKING YOU.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.874
YOU WERE PASSED OUT.
YOU'D THROWN UP.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.578
- I KIND OF REMEMBER.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.546
I THREW UP IN A CAB.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.716
THE GUY MADE ME GET OUT.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.586
HE DROVE OFF WITH MY PURSE.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.121
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
THIS GIRL VOMITS ALL OVER.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.823
- SO YOU JUST THROW HER
OUT YOUR CAB?

08:42.856 --> 08:43.991
- I HAD TO CLEAN UP.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.126
I DO THE RIGHT THING, TOLD
THE GARAGE I HAD HER PURSE.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.294
- WHERE'D YOU PICK HER UP?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.796
- 57TH AND 11TH.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.831
A YOUNG GUY GAVE ME 50
TO TAKE HER HOME.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.733
BAD DEAL FOR ME.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.035
- HEY, SHE HAD
AN AUDITION YESTERDAY--

08:55.068 --> 08:58.839
THE SHOWGIRLS PROJECT,
SANDOW FILMS.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.674
- YEAH, THAT'S THAT
NEW REALITY SHOW.

09:00.708 --> 09:04.277
SINGERS WILL DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO GET THEIR BIG BREAK.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.883
- MR. SANDOW, YOUR 5:00.
SHE'S A LITTLE EARLY.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.084
- LACEY!

09:11.118 --> 09:13.821
- LACEY, HI!
COME ON IN.

09:13.854 --> 09:17.357
- WOW! YOU HAVE

09:17.390 --> 09:18.992
- WELL,

09:22.295 --> 09:25.098
- YOU WANT TO HOLD IT?
GO AHEAD.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.167
JESS, YOU CAN TAKE OFF.
- OH, THANKS.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.936
- UM, EDDIE.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.338
GIVE US A FEW MINUTES WITHOUT
THE CAMERA, ALL RIGHT?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.812
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.
GO. SIT.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.120
- SO HOW WAS SHE
AFTER THE AUDITION?

09:47.154 --> 09:48.288
- I HAD ALREADY LEFT.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.391
THE NEXT MORNING MR. SANDOW
TOLD ME MALLORY WAS SICK.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.628
- WE'LL NEED TO SPEAK
TO MR. SANDOW.

09:54.662 --> 09:55.929

09:59.933 --> 10:01.368

OUR ASSOCIATE PRODUCER.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.270
- I'M DETECTIVE BENSON.
THIS IS DETECTIVE AMARO.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.006

IN A CAB LAST NIGHT?

10:06.039 --> 10:07.741
- UH, YES.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.876
SHE WAS A MESS.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.111
SHE PROBABLY DRANK BEFORE
SHE CAME TO THE AUDITION.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.213

10:13.246 --> 10:15.649

AND HE'S IN AN AUDITION.
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

10:17.284 --> 10:21.021
- DO YOU HEAR SOMEONE
SHOUTING FOR HELP?

10:22.122 --> 10:22.990
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

10:23.023 --> 10:24.257
- STOP! POLICE!
STEP AWAY FROM THE GIRL.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.292
- I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN AUDITION!

10:25.325 --> 10:26.359
- STEP AWAY FROM THE GIRL.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.995
- DAD, I TOLD THEM

10:28.028 --> 10:30.731
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.133
DID YOU WANT
THIS TO HAPPEN?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.134
- NO.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.936
I'M SO DIZZY.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.905
- CALL AN AMBULANCE.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.873
- FRED SANDOW,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.742
- WE WERE IMPROVISING!
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

10:41.775 --> 10:43.410
DON'T YOU KNOW WHO HE IS?
- DON'T GET HYSTERICAL.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.112
CALL STANITCH.
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.047
- ALL RIGHT, STOP.
HEY, LEAVE MY DAD ALONE!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.849
- HEY.
- GET OFF! GET OFF!

10:48.882 --> 10:50.918
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
UP AGAINST THE WALL!

10:50.951 --> 10:53.186
YOUR DAD IS IN TROUBLE...

10:53.220 --> 10:56.790
AND SO ARE YOU.
LET'S GO.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.358
- REALITY TV
PUSHES THE ENVELOPE.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.061
AUDIENCES EXPECT
SEXUAL TITILLATION.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.863
- BY WHICH
YOU MEAN RAPE?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.297
- MY CLIENT WAS REHEARSING.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.167
THE OTHER DETECTIVE
JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.102
- SHE WAS PHYSICALLY HELPLESS.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.437
- SHE WAS ACTING HELPLESS.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.940
SHE WAS IN COMPLETE CONTROL
OF HERSELF, OF ME.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.943
- AND HOW
ABOUT MALLORY JENNER?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.045
SHE COULDN'T EVEN LEAVE
YOUR PLACE STANDING UP.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.213
- THAT YOUNG WOMAN WAS DRUNK
WHEN SHE ARRIVED, DETECTIVE.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.982
- BUT YOU DIDN'T STOP
THE AUDITION?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.117
- I'M A PRODUCER,
NOT A SOBER COACH.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.054
- RIGHT, SO WHY NOT
OFFER MORE CHAMPAGNE?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.956
- MY ASSISTANT OFFERED
HER ONE GLASS.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.959
- MM, 'CAUSE MALLORY
HAD QUAALUDES IN HER SYSTEM.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.796
NOW, I'M THINKING THAT THE LAB
IS PROBABLY GOING TO FIND TRACES

11:35.829 --> 11:37.097
IN THAT CHAMPAGNE GLASS.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.867
- WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN
PUT THERE BY HER.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.203
DID SHE, BY ANY CHANCE,
GO TO THE RESTROOM WITH HER BAG?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.272
- YES, ACTUALLY, SHE DID.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.474
AND WHEN I REALIZED SHE WAS
IN NO SHAPE TO CONTINUE,

11:47.507 --> 11:49.109
I HAD MY SON
HAIL HER A CAB.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.844
- YOUR SON?

11:50.878 --> 11:53.146
YOU ALWAYS HAVE HIM
CLEAN UP YOUR MESS?

11:53.180 --> 11:54.815
- HE'S MY PRODUCER.

11:54.848 --> 11:58.318
AND HE KNOWS
I DIDN'T RAPE THOSE GIRLS.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.187
WHY WOULD I HAVE TO?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.956
THEY'D DO ANYTHING
TO GET ONSTAGE.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.993
MY SON'S THERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.360
HE'S VIDEOTAPING.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.962
MY ASSISTANT'S THERE.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.497
LISTEN, I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.399
AND I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.204
- LACEY...

12:17.237 --> 12:19.807
UM, THE COUNSELOR
FROM THE HOSPITAL

12:19.840 --> 12:22.142
SAID THAT--
THAT YOU REFUSED THE RAPE KIT?

12:22.175 --> 12:24.411
- I WAS NOT RAPED.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.114
MR. SANDOW
DID NOT DO ANYTHING.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.382
- WHEN WE CAME IN,
YOUR DRESS WAS OPEN.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.550
HE WAS ON TOP OF YOU.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.385
YOU SAYING YOU WANTED
THAT TO HAPPEN?

12:32.419 --> 12:35.889
- LACEY, MR. SANDOW
ASSAULTED YOU.

12:35.923 --> 12:40.560
HE ASSAULTED
ANOTHER WOMAN LAST NIGHT.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.396
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO STOP HIM.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.433
- IF HE GOES TO PRISON...

12:46.466 --> 12:49.569
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SHOW?

12:49.602 --> 12:53.140
I REALLY WANT THIS PART.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.014
- MALLORY MUST HAVE BEEN
ON SOMETHING.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.916
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
GET SICK LIKE THAT BEFORE.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.951
- AND?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.053
- I ASKED IF SHE WANTED TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL,

13:06.086 --> 13:08.021
AND SHE SWORE AT ME.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.390
- NOW, WERE YOU EVER ALONE
WITH MALLORY?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.892
- NO.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.894
- WAS YOUR DAD ALONE WITH HER?

13:16.363 --> 13:18.598
- YES, BUT JUST SO
HE COULD WORK WITH HER.

13:18.631 --> 13:22.435
IT'S REALITY TV,
BUT HE TAKES IT VERY SERIOUSLY.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.338
LOOK, PEOPLE SAY BAD THINGS
ABOUT MY DAD,

13:25.372 --> 13:27.240
BUT THAT'S NOT WHO HE IS.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.877
- OKAY, SO WHY
DON'T YOU TELL US WHO HE IS?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.611
- HE'S A FAMOUS FILMMAKER.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.882
HE WON THE DOCUMENTAS IN 1992.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.450
- THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO.

13:37.484 --> 13:41.288
- HE GAVE UP HIS CAREER
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.623
THERE'S NO MONEY
IN DOCUMENTARIES.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.627
- HEY, WHERE'S
YOUR MOTHER, EDDIE?

13:47.660 --> 13:51.098
- SHE WALKED OUT ON US,
WITH MY SISTER, WHEN I WAS TEN.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.567
- THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD ON YOU.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.971
- THAT BITCH?
BETTER OFF WITHOUT.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.308
- IS THAT WHAT
YOUR FATHER TOLD YOU?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.177
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY DAD.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.946
YOU KNOW, HE'S AWESOME.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.348
WHEN I WAS 16,
I WAS A LOSER.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.417
HE BOUGHT ME
MY OWN APARTMENT.

14:10.450 --> 14:15.322
I'D HAVE GIRLS, PARTIES,
ANYTHING I EVER WANTED.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.191
SEE, MY DAD KNOWS
HOW PEOPLE ARE.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.361
- AND HOW ARE THEY, EDDIE?

14:21.394 --> 14:24.364
- EVERYBODY ALWAYS
WANTS SOMETHING.

14:24.397 --> 14:28.936
ALL THESE GIRLS JUST WANT
MY DAD TO MAKE THEM A STAR.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.374
THEY ONLY CARE
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.976
- NO CHARGES?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.178
MALLORY I.D.'D THE PHOTO
OF SANDOW.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.315
- BUT SHE CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED, AND, UH...

14:42.349 --> 14:44.918
LACEY FORD
SAYS NOTHING HAPPENED.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.653
- THAT WASN'T HER STORY
AT THE SCENE.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.156
THIS WAS A GOOD ARREST.
- RIGHT.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.458
WHICH ONE OF YOU
HEARD THE SCREAMS

14:51.491 --> 14:53.393
THROUGH THE SOUNDPROOF DOOR?

14:53.426 --> 14:55.462
- ALL RIGHT, SO, COUNSELOR,
YOU'RE SAYING

14:55.495 --> 14:57.697
NEXT TIME IT'S BETTER
IF WE WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE RAPE

14:57.730 --> 14:59.066
BEFORE WE INTERVENE?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.301
- IF HE HIT ON TWO GIRLS
IN TWO DAYS,

15:01.334 --> 15:02.569
THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.671
WE SHOULD GO THROUGH
THIS CREEP'S TALENT LIST.

15:04.704 --> 15:08.075
- ANY CHANCE THE ASSISTANT
OR THE SON WILL COOPERATE?

15:08.108 --> 15:10.077
- OH, NOT THE SON--
IDOLIZES THE FATHER.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.611
- HE THINKS SANDOW'S
FATHER OF THE YEAR

15:11.644 --> 15:13.180
'CAUSE HE PIMPED GIRLS FOR HIM.
[cell phone chimes]

15:13.213 --> 15:14.447
- ALL RIGHT, THEN TALK
TO THE ASSISTANT

15:14.481 --> 15:15.715
AWAY FROM THE OFFICE.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.284
- WELL, THIS MAY HELP.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.052
LAB JUST FOUND TRACES
OF QUAALUDES

15:19.086 --> 15:20.520
IN ONE
OF THE CHAMPAGNE GLASSES.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.490
- NOW, THAT WILL GET US
A SEARCH WARRANT...

15:23.523 --> 15:27.227
UNLESS YOU'D RATHER
BUST IN AGAIN WITHOUT ONE.

15:34.434 --> 15:38.538
- THAT'S A LOT OF HARDWARE
FOR A SINGING COMPETITION.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.407
WANT TO BET
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PERMIT?

15:40.440 --> 15:43.310
- IT'S TOO BAD.
SANDOW DID HAVE A LEGIT CAREER.

15:43.343 --> 15:47.014
- WELL, HIS LAST MOVIE
WAS 20 YEARS AGO.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.617
HE'S LIVING OFF FUMES
OF FORMER GLORY.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.519
- HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US,
MY FRIEND.

15:54.721 --> 15:58.091
- QUAALUDES...

15:58.125 --> 16:00.093
ERECTION MEDS.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.329
- LET ME GUESS--
SANDOW NEEDED A LITTLE HELP

16:02.362 --> 16:05.198
WITH HIS ARTISTIC PROCESS.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.199
- MR. SANDOW'S A GOOD BOSS.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.635
HE PAYS ME WELL,
COVERS MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.670
- THIS IS A NICE CRIB.
HE PAY YOUR RENT TOO?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.172
- NO.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.074
THIS IS HIS SON'S APARTMENT.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.742
- YOU LIVE WITH EDDIE?

16:15.775 --> 16:17.244
HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.312
HOW LONG YOU TWO
BEEN TOGETHER?

16:19.346 --> 16:20.180
- A YEAR.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.115
HE TREATS MY DAUGHTER
LIKE HIS OWN.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.616
HE'S IN THE PARK
WITH LILY NOW.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.817
- HMM.

16:24.851 --> 16:28.221
I MEAN, YOU GOT A NICE LIFE
HERE, YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.656
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO MESS THAT,

16:29.689 --> 16:31.458
BUT I GOT TO LEVEL
WITH YOU.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.226
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.661
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.264
- YOUR BOSS IS BEING PROSECUTED
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.565
- WE HAVE HIS DNA.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.034
WE FOUND TRACES OF QUAALUDES
ON A CHAMPAGNE GLASS--

16:41.068 --> 16:42.069
CHAMPAGNE THAT YOU POURED.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.370
- I DIDN'T PUT THAT
IN THERE.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.538
- THAT'S NOT GOING
TO REALLY MATTER TO THE D.A.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.307
YOU'RE AN ACCOMPLICE.
THEY'RE GOING TO COME HERE.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.675
THEY'RE GOING
TO TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER,

16:48.708 --> 16:50.210
TAKE HER OFF
TO SOME FOSTER CARE.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.511
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.813
- NO. PLEASE.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.549
- TELL US ABOUT MALLORY.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.355
- I'D GONE HOME.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.324
WHENEVER HE BOOKS
A 5:00 P.M. AUDITION,

17:04.357 --> 17:07.227
I JUST HAVE TO STAY AND GREET,
AND THEN HE LETS ME GO.

17:07.260 --> 17:11.098
- OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO NEED
A LIST OF ALL HIS FIVE O'CLOCKS.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.499
- EDDIE'S GOING TO BE UPSET.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.167
- HE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.236
- IF YOUR BOSS
IS A GOOD GUY,

17:16.269 --> 17:18.405
WE WON'T FIND ANYTHING.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.544
- NO, YOU--

17:24.577 --> 17:26.413
YOU WILL.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.118
THE NEXT MORNING,
AFTER MR. SANDOW SAID

17:31.151 --> 17:33.120
MALLORY WENT HOME SICK,
I CAME IN EARLY

17:33.153 --> 17:35.255
TO STRAIGHTEN UP
THE OFFICE.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.625
I FOUND THESE
UNDER THE COUCH CUSHIONS.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.728
- HER UNDERWEAR
AND STOCKINGS.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.864
- AND I'LL TEXT YOU
THOSE NAMES.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.566
[lock clicks]

17:46.599 --> 17:48.301
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE NOT TICKLISH, RIGHT?

17:48.335 --> 17:49.636
- COME ON,
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING?

17:49.669 --> 17:52.139
YOU EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE THAT?

17:52.172 --> 17:53.440
- NO, I SWEAR.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.641
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, JESS?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.776
- THE DETECTIVES
WERE JUST LEAVING.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.746
- ALL RIGHT, GIVE US A CALL
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.847
- MOMMY, MOMMY...

18:00.880 --> 18:02.882
WE HAD FUN.
- GOOD.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.118
[laughs]

18:06.653 --> 18:07.754
[door closes]

18:07.787 --> 18:09.556
- WHAT WERE THEY
ASKING ABOUT?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.791
- I TOLD THEM THEY WERE CRAZY.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.660
YOU SOUND CRANKY.

18:13.693 --> 18:14.861
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY.

18:14.894 --> 18:18.365
HOW ABOUT PIZZA ROLLS
FOR DINNER, HMM?

18:18.398 --> 18:19.666
YEAH?

18:21.368 --> 18:22.669
- PEOPLE ON BAIL?

18:22.702 --> 18:26.206
- REMAND. MR. SANDOW IS FACING
MULTIPLE FELONY CHARGES

18:26.239 --> 18:27.740
AND HAS MEANS TO FLEE.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.177
- MR. SANDOW HAS
NO CRIMINAL RECORD

18:30.210 --> 18:33.280
AND IS THE CUSTODIAL PARENT
OF A TEENAGE SON.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.415
- WHO DOESN'T LIVE AT HOME.

18:35.448 --> 18:40.153
- YOUR HONOR, SANDOW
IS A LONG-TERM SERIAL PREDATOR.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.422
- ALL RIGHT, MR. CUTTER,
BAIL IS DENIED.

18:42.455 --> 18:46.193
DEFENDANT REMANDED
TO RIKERS.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.295
- DAD, DAD,
I'LL GET YOU OUT.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.629
- AFTER ALL
I'VE DONE FOR YOU,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.264
YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND
TURN AGAINST ME.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.399
- WHAT?

18:52.432 --> 18:54.434
NO, I'D NEVER--

18:54.467 --> 18:55.502
DAD!

18:55.535 --> 18:58.205
- SOMEBODY TALKED
TO THOSE COPS.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.509
- YOU TRICKED JESS!
YOU TURNED HER AGAINST US.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.277
- ALL RIGHT, EDDIE,
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.478
- TAKE IT EASY.
- GET OFF ME.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.679
MY DAD DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

19:06.713 --> 19:07.680
- NICK, NICK,
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.516
EDDIE, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET, OKAY?

19:09.549 --> 19:12.385
- GOD, THESE GIRLS--
YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.487
MY DAD SAYS
THIS IS A SHAKEDOWN.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.257
HE'S OLD.
HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.459
- EDDIE, YOUR FATHER
CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.694
IT'S YOU
THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.430
NOW, DO YOU HAVE
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO?

19:23.463 --> 19:24.631
BECAUSE THIS IS A LOT--

19:24.664 --> 19:27.300
- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!
- HEY, ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.401
COME ON,
LET'S TAKE A WALK.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.702
- IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO MY DAD,

19:29.736 --> 19:31.304
I SWEAR TO GOD
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.640
- GO GET SOME AIR.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.753
- EDDIE.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.222
- HI, MOMMY.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.865
- EDDIE, PLEASE.

20:00.467 --> 20:04.437
- YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T TELL
THE POLICE ANYTHING, JESS.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.406
YOU LIED TO ME.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.357
- ONE OF YOU BENSON?
- YES, CHIEF.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.293
- BENSON, AMARO,
CHIEF DUGGAN.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.594
- THIS IS SERGEANT MULLEN,
H.N.T.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.828
- THE GUNMAN
ASKED FOR YOU.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.331
- EDDIE SANDOW?
- HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

20:31.364 --> 20:32.365
- HE'S ANGRY.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.767
- WE ARRESTED EDDIE'S FATHER
ON SEXUAL ASSAULT.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.035
THE KID
WAS PRETTY WOUND UP.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.537
- WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?
- NOT SURE.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.671
WE'RE SETTING UP
A POLE CAM.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.707
- THE BOY UPSTAIRS KNOCKS
ON THE DOOR THIS MORNING.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.575
HE AND THE DAUGHTER--
- LILY, SHE'S EIGHT.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.710
- THEY WALK TO SCHOOL
TOGETHER.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.513
INSTEAD, YOUR GUY OPENS
THE DOOR HOLDING A GUN ON LILY,

20:46.546 --> 20:48.381
SAYS SHE'S NOT
GOING TODAY.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.682
- WELL, WHAT
ABOUT THE GIRL'S MOTHER?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.584
- WE DON'T KNOW.
SANDOW WON'T TALK.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.521
SLID A PIECE OF PAPER
UNDER THE DOOR WITH YOUR NAME.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.924
- DETECTIVE,
IS HE SETTING YOU UP?

20:57.957 --> 20:59.792
- I HOPE NOT.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.394
LEAD THE WAY.

21:14.874 --> 21:18.411
- EDDIE, I BROUGHT
DETECTIVE BENSON.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.314
- EDDIE,
IT'S DETECTIVE BENSON.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.682
EVERYBODY OKAY IN THERE?

21:22.715 --> 21:24.584
- NO.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.753
NO, WE'RE NOT ALL RIGHT.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.055
- IS SOMEBODY HURT?
- YOU DON'T CARE.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.623
YOU'RE ALL OUT TO GET ME.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.692
- EDDIE, YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.428
WE WANT EVERYONE TO BE OKAY.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.664
- REALLY?
EVEN MY DAD?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.366
'CAUSE HE'S IN RIKERS
'CAUSE OF YOU.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.100
- EDDIE, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THAT,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.570
BUT FIRST I NEED TO KNOW
THAT EVERYONE'S ALL RIGHT.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.440
EDDIE?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.443
ARE JESS AND LIL
WITH YOU?

21:54.080 --> 21:57.784
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE THEY ARE?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.819
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH,
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

21:59.852 --> 22:00.953
- OKAY, GREAT.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.890
CAN THEY SAY SOMETHING?
- WHAT, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.925
- I DO, EDDIE.
I DO.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.027
BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE HERE--
THEY NEED TO KNOW

22:08.060 --> 22:10.530
THAT JESS AND LILY ARE OKAY.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.870
- JESS, SAY YOU'RE OKAY.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.706
- I'M HERE.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.841
I'M FINE.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.676
- GREAT.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.779
CAN LILY SAY SOMETHING?

22:26.813 --> 22:31.551
- GO AHEAD, LILY.
SAY SOMETHING.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.620
- I'M HUNGRY.

22:33.653 --> 22:34.821
- GOOD, GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.456
GOOD JOB, LILY.
- EDDIE, THIS IS GREAT.

22:36.489 --> 22:39.626
THIS MEANS
THAT THIS CAN ALL WORK OUT.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.828
- YEAH, IT CAN...

22:41.861 --> 22:44.564
IF YOU JUST
LET MY DAD GO.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.833
- WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT,
EDDIE, BUT--

22:46.866 --> 22:48.067
BUT I'M JUST A DETECTIVE.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.469
IT'S NOT MY CALL.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.704
- THEN GET A D.A. HERE.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.974
- EDDIE, WHY DON'T
YOU LET LILY GO,

22:55.007 --> 22:56.876
AND THEN WE'LL TALK
TO A D.A.?

22:56.909 --> 22:58.745
- OH, SURE, HEY...

22:58.778 --> 23:00.513
YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

23:00.547 --> 23:04.551
WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU MY GUN
AND COME OUT WITH MY HANDS UP

23:04.584 --> 23:06.085
AND A TARGET
ON MY FOREHEAD!

23:06.118 --> 23:09.422
- EDDIE, LISTEN TO ME.
I'M SORRY. I GET IT. I GET IT.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.759
- YOU WANT ME
TO LET LILY GO, HUH?

23:12.792 --> 23:16.629
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW MY DAD IS.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.998
BRING HIM HERE.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.567
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.536
- JUST GET HIM HERE!
I'M DONE TALKING.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.644
- THE FATHER'S AT RIKERS.
IT'S BAD PRECEDENT.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.446
- THAT KID IS 19 YEARS OLD,
GOING ON 10.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.981
HE HAS NO IMPULSE CONTROL.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.884
HIS FATHER
IS HIS WHOLE WORLD.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.119
- AND YOU WANT
TO DROP HIM INTO THIS?

23:40.152 --> 23:43.556
- YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

23:43.590 --> 23:46.693
- EDDIE ALREADY FEELS THAT
HIS GIRLFRIEND BETRAYED HIM.

23:46.726 --> 23:52.431
IF WE JERK HIM AROUND...
HE'S GOING TO TURN ON ME TOO.

23:57.737 --> 23:58.671
[door buzzer]

23:58.705 --> 24:02.842
- YOU WANT ME
TO TALK EDDIE OFF THE LEDGE?

24:02.875 --> 24:04.677
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO FOR ME?

24:04.711 --> 24:06.112
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

24:06.145 --> 24:09.716
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,
HONEY, EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.851
YOU'RE IN A BAD SITUATION.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.120
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE
THAT LITTLE GIRL.

24:14.153 --> 24:17.089
- THIS IS YOUR SON
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.258
- HIS BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS,
NOT MINE.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.128
- WHEN WE SEARCHED YOUR PLACE,
WE FOUND PLENTY OF HARDWARE.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.797
SO I'M BETTING THAT THE GUN
THAT HE'S USING IS YOURS.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.666
- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ANY GUNS.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.802
YOU WANT MY HELP,
YOU PAY MY PRICE--

24:29.836 --> 24:32.238
ALL CHARGES DROPPED,
FULL IMMUNITY,

24:32.271 --> 24:33.840
AND A PUBLIC APOLOGY.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.742
- WE COULDN'T DO THAT
IF WE WANTED TO.

24:35.775 --> 24:39.579
- YOU MADE THESE CHARGES UP.
YOU CAN MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.113
- OKAY, ONE STEP AT A TIME.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.982
YOU COME WITH US.
YOU TALK YOUR SON.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.651
AND WE'LL TALK
TO THE D.A.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.753
- OTHER WAY AROUND.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.822
WHEN MY LAWYER SIGNS OFF,
THEN I'LL HELP YOU.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.594
OH, AND ABOUT EDDIE,
I WOULDN'T WAIT TOO LONG.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.863
POOR KID--
HE'S GOT BLOOD-SUGAR PROBLEMS.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.031
HIS MOODS
CAN REALLY SWING.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.605
- IS MY DAD HERE?

25:05.638 --> 25:07.139
- WE'RE WORKING ON THAT.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.108
- JUST GET HIM HERE!

25:11.611 --> 25:12.779
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:12.812 --> 25:14.313
- THE FATHER'S NOT COMING.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.715
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.550
NO, NO, NO.
LET ME TALK TO YOUR BOSS.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.885
- IT'S NOT HIM.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.954
SANDOW WON'T COOPERATE
UNLESS WE DROP THE CHARGES.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.823
- HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT HIS SON?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.825
- DO WE KNOW WHO ELSE
IS IN EDDIE'S LIFE?

25:25.858 --> 25:27.226
- YEAH, FIN AND ROLLINS
ARE TRYING TO GET

25:27.259 --> 25:28.961
IN CONTACT WITH THE MOTHER
AND SISTER IN CANADA.

25:28.995 --> 25:31.664
- THE MOTHER'S NOT GOING
TO BE ANY HELP--HE HATES HER.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.265
[sighs]

25:33.299 --> 25:34.667
SO NOW I HAVE TO GO IN THERE

25:34.701 --> 25:36.068
AND TELL HIM
THAT HIS FATHER'S NOT SHOWING?

25:36.102 --> 25:37.269
- TELL HIM
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.105
YOU TELL HIM THE TRUTH,
HE COULD LOSE IT.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.808
- AND IF HE SENSES
THAT I'M LYING, IT'S OVER.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.309
- DETECTIVE...

25:46.746 --> 25:49.982
- IF HE ASKS ME,
I'M TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.852
[door opens]

25:52.885 --> 25:54.921
- DETECTIVE BENSON?

25:54.954 --> 25:56.155
- I'M RIGHT HERE, EDDIE.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.724
I'M RIGHT HERE.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.291
- I THOUGHT YOU'D LEFT.
- NO, NO, NO.

25:59.325 --> 26:02.762
I'M JUST RIGHT HERE,
ALWAYS.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.131
- THEY GOT GUYS ON THE ROOFS...

26:05.164 --> 26:08.300
WITH RIFLES POINTED AT ME.
- I KNOW.

26:08.334 --> 26:12.104
LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

26:13.840 --> 26:16.809
- WHERE'S MY DAD?
IS HE HERE YET?

26:16.843 --> 26:18.745
- WE'RE WORKING ON IT, EDDIE.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.147
- WHERE IS HE?
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.182
WHERE IS HE?

26:23.215 --> 26:25.251
- EDDIE...

26:25.284 --> 26:27.887
EDDIE, YOUR FATHER'S
NOT COMING.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.057
- BUT YOU SAID
YOU'D GET HIM HERE.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.761
- AND I TRIED,
BUT HE, UH...

26:34.794 --> 26:37.363
HE DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS A VERY GOOD IDEA.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.300
- SO YOU LIED TO ME?

26:41.333 --> 26:42.869
- NO, NO, I DID NOT.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.704
EDDIE, WAIT.
WAIT, PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME.

26:44.737 --> 26:45.738
LISTEN TO ME.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.039
- IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO MY DAD,

26:47.073 --> 26:49.008
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'LL SHOOT ALL OF US.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.877
- LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE
A CLEAR SIGHT.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.378
- LISTEN TO ME.
PLEASE, STOP.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.146
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT
LIKE THIS.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.715
- STEP ASIDE, DETECTIVE.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.750
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOOT HIM.
WILL JUST GIVE ME--

26:57.784 --> 26:59.385
- THAT IS ENOUGH, DETECTIVE.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.754
SOMEBODY GET HER OUT OF HERE.
- COME ON.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.659
- THE SNIPERS--EDDIE SEES THEM.
HE WANTS THEM TO PULL BACK.

27:06.693 --> 27:09.028
- WE LET YOU PLAY SOCIAL WORKER.
NOW LET US DO OUR JOB.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.196
- EXCUSE ME?

27:10.229 --> 27:11.998
- DETECTIVE BENSON HAS A
RELATIONSHIP WITH EDDIE SANDOW--

27:12.031 --> 27:13.265
- WE GAVE YOU YOUR CHANCE,
ALL RIGHT?

27:13.299 --> 27:15.067
WE CAN'T RISK THE HOSTAGES.

27:15.101 --> 27:16.803
[cell phone rings]
- CHIEF, HOW WE DOING?

27:16.836 --> 27:18.337
- IT IS WHAT IT IS--PUNK WANTS
A DEAL FOR THE FATHER.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.073
- CRAGEN.
- CAN'T DO THAT.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.409
- IF WE NEED YOUR HELP,
COUNSELOR, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.044
- FIN AND ROLLINS TALKED
TO THE MOTHER AND SISTER.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.045
THEY'RE FLYING DOWN.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.681
- THAT'S ONLY GOING
TO ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.282
- DO WE HAVE AN E.T.A.
ON THE FAMILY?

27:30.316 --> 27:31.450
- THEY'RE GOING
TO BLOW THIS.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.920
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU HAVE A CONNECTION THIS KID,

27:33.953 --> 27:36.388
BUT THE CHIEF DOESN'T SEE EDDIE
AS A SPECIAL VICTIM.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.290
- YOU TOO?

27:38.324 --> 27:40.026
- WHAT?

27:40.059 --> 27:43.262
- EDDIE IS A SCARED BOY,
AND THESE GUYS--

27:43.295 --> 27:46.332
THEY'D BE HAPPY TO CARRY HIM OUT
IN A BODY BAG.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.402
- BETTER HIM THAN YOU.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.439
- WILL YOU LET ME GO IN THERE
AND TRY TO GET HIM TO EAT?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.107
- THE MOTHER AND SISTER
ARE ALMOST HERE.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.710
- WHO HE HASN'T SPOKEN WITH
IN THREE YEARS.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.211
- LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S A HAIL MARY,

27:59.245 --> 28:01.748
BUT WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF OPTIONS.

28:01.781 --> 28:05.017
[siren wailing]

28:05.051 --> 28:06.452
- MY SON--
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.120
- MOM, JUST SLOW DOWN,
PLEASE.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.256
- THIS IS ALL
YOUR FATHER'S FAULT.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.291
- ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS
EDDIE'S MOTHER AND HIS SISTER.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.160
- I'LL LET YOUR SON KNOW
YOU'RE HERE.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.795
- PLEASE.
IS HE OKAY?

28:15.828 --> 28:17.864
- AND, UH, THE MOTHER
DID NOT STOP TALKING

28:17.897 --> 28:19.899
THE ENTIRE RIDE IN,
BUT I GOT A FEELING

28:19.932 --> 28:22.301
THE SISTER'S GOT
A LITTLE SOMETHING TO SAY.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.036
- THANKS.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.172
CAN I ASK YOU
TO STEP OVER HERE?

28:28.875 --> 28:30.810
- ARE YOU THE ONE
WHO ARRESTED MY FATHER?

28:30.843 --> 28:32.411
- I AM.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.847
- YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.316
MY BROTHER...

28:37.349 --> 28:39.051
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

28:39.085 --> 28:42.454
ALL THOSE YEARS ALONE
WITH MY DAD...

28:44.323 --> 28:46.325
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.031
- EDDIE...

28:52.064 --> 28:54.867
I GOT YOUR FAMILY HERE.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.903
EDDIE.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.104
- IS MY DAD HERE?

28:58.137 --> 29:00.172
- STILL WORKING THAT.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.207
- YOUR MOM'S HERE.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.175
- I DON'T HAVE A MOTHER.
WHAT ARE YOU, AN IDIOT?

29:03.209 --> 29:05.778
MY MOM'S DEAD TO ME.

29:05.812 --> 29:09.448
- OKAY, COME ON.
HERE WE GO.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.784
- WAIT.
WHERE YOU GOING?

29:11.818 --> 29:13.419
- EDDIE, LILY
HAS TO GO PEE.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.121
- NO, NO, NO.
SIT BACK DOWN.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.323
- I'M JUST TAKING HER
TO THE BATHROOM.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.927
- EDDIE,
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.895
- STAY WHERE YOU ARE, JESS.
- YOU STOP IT.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.931
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.
JUST STOP.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.132
- SIT BACK DOWN, JESS!
- NO!

29:26.165 --> 29:27.466
- GIVE HER BACK TO ME!
- NO!

29:27.499 --> 29:29.068
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:29.101 --> 29:32.538
- GIVE HER BACK!
GET BACK! STAY BACK!

29:32.571 --> 29:35.274
- THREW ME IN THAT--
[gunshot]

29:35.307 --> 29:37.877
- OH, MY GOD,
THEY SHOT MY BABY!

29:37.910 --> 29:39.445
NO! NO!

29:43.115 --> 29:45.084
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE THE DOOR DOWN.
- HOLD ON. WAIT. WAIT.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.486
- DETECTIVE, STAND BACK.
- NO.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.221
DON'T DO THIS.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.990
- WHAT DO WE GOT
ON THE POLE CAM?

29:51.023 --> 29:52.925
- HE HASN'T MOVED.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.326
STILL HAS THE GUN
ON THE GIRL'S HEAD.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.862
- LET ME TALK TO HIM.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.563
- YOU BUST IN THERE RIGHT NOW,
HE'LL KILL THE GIRL.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.866
- PLEASE.

29:59.899 --> 30:03.102
- OKAY, BUT ONE RAISED VOICE,
WE'RE COMING IN.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.976
- EDDIE...

30:10.009 --> 30:12.344
EDDIE,
IT'S DETECTIVE BENSON.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.381
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T TALK
BEFORE, BUT--BUT I'M HERE NOW.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.617
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:18.650 --> 30:21.287
- THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.421
- OKAY.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.390
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO GOT HURT?

30:24.423 --> 30:26.258
- JESS.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.294
SHE JUST WOULDN'T STOP,
YOU KNOW.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.529
SHE WOULDN'T SHUT UP.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

30:30.562 --> 30:32.464
- I KNOW, EDDIE.
I KNOW.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.201
BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE A WOUNDED
PERSON IN THERE, ALL RIGHT?

30:35.234 --> 30:37.870
SO WE HAVE TO COME IN, OKAY?

30:37.904 --> 30:39.906
WILL YOU LET ME HELP YOU?

30:41.407 --> 30:43.342
EDDIE...

30:43.375 --> 30:45.377
WE NEED TO COME IN
AND HELP JESS, OKAY?

30:45.411 --> 30:48.114
- I DON'T WANT ANYONE IN HERE.
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.248
EDDIE,
I KNOW YOU DON'T,

30:49.281 --> 30:51.350
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE SCARED RIGHT NOW.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.085
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY
IF YOU TRUST ME.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.520
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

30:54.553 --> 30:55.654
EDDIE?

30:55.687 --> 31:00.292
JUST LET ME COME IN THERE
AND HELP JESS, ALL RIGHT?

31:00.326 --> 31:02.561
PLEASE, EDDIE.

31:05.364 --> 31:09.368
- JUST YOU, BY YOURSELF.
- OKAY. OKAY.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.978
- YOU SURE?
- I'M SURE.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.583
OPEN THE DOOR,
OKAY, EDDIE?

31:26.452 --> 31:30.022
[lock clicks]

31:30.056 --> 31:31.457
- I HAVE THE GUN POINTED
RIGHT AT LILY.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.160
IF THIS IS A TRICK--
- IT'S NOT A TRICK.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.162
IT'S NOT A TRICK.

31:39.398 --> 31:43.535
IT'S OKAY, EDDIE.
IT'S OKAY.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.672
SEE, THERE'S NO GUN.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.008
I'M GOING TO GO TO JESS NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

31:52.344 --> 31:53.579
HEY.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.147
YOU'RE OKAY.

31:57.016 --> 32:00.319
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE OKAY, ALL RIGHT?

32:05.024 --> 32:07.493
HANG IN THERE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.662
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.165
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A LITTLE TIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

32:13.199 --> 32:14.933
- AAH!

32:17.036 --> 32:19.005
- YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.473
EDDIE, I'M GOING
TO CALL OUTSIDE,

32:21.507 --> 32:23.309
AND I'M GONNA TELL THEM
TO COME IN AND TAKE JESS OUT--

32:23.342 --> 32:25.477
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.680
- EDDIE, COME ON,
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HER HERE.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.150
LISTEN TO ME.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.986
YOU CAN PUT
THE GUN ON ME, OKAY?

32:34.020 --> 32:36.022
I'M GOING TO HAVE
MY PARTNER COME IN HERE.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.489
HE'S NOT GOING
TO LET ME GET SHOT.

32:37.523 --> 32:41.460
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY,
I PROMISE.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.729
EDDIE, PUT THE GUN ON ME.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.365
AND LET LILY GO SIT DOWN.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.301
PLEASE.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.237
THERE WE GO.
OKAY.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.504
OKAY.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.673
NICK?

32:54.706 --> 32:57.776
- YEAH, I'M RIGHT HERE.
- IT'S ALL GOOD IN HERE.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.379
EDDIE SAID THAT IT'S OKAY
FOR YOU TO COME IN

33:00.412 --> 33:02.314
AND TAKE JESS OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

33:02.348 --> 33:05.484
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S JUST ME.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.120
- I'LL SHOOT HER,
I SWEAR TO GOD!

33:08.154 --> 33:09.555
- I'M UNARMED.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.690
- OKAY.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.196
I'M GOING
TO OPEN THE DOOR.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.073
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- WE'RE ALL GOOD.

33:27.106 --> 33:30.176
- YEAH?
- JESS IS OVER THERE.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.578
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.549
- HEY, JESS.

33:37.583 --> 33:40.286
HEY, JESS, WE'RE GOING
GET YOU SOME HELP, ALL RIGHT?

33:40.319 --> 33:41.520
- YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING, EDDIE.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.122
- THIS MIGHT HURT
A LITTLE, OKAY?

33:43.155 --> 33:46.092
HERE WE GO.
- [groaning in pain]

33:46.125 --> 33:48.294
- LILY, LILY.
- MOMMY.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.462
- DON'T MOVE!
DON'T MOVE!

33:50.496 --> 33:53.632
LILY! LILY! LILY, DON'T MOVE!
- LILY, COME HERE, SWEETHEART.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.667
SHH. JUST SIT DOWN.
I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH ME.

33:55.701 --> 33:56.835
YOUR MOMMY'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.539
HERE, SWEETIE, I WANT YOU
TO HAVE A SEAT RIGHT THERE.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.740
- JUST GO.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.277
- HE'S COMING OUT.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.784
- ALL RIGHT, JESS,
GONNA GET YOU SOME HELP.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.721
- HOW'S LIV HOLDING UP?

34:15.754 --> 34:17.723
- HE'S GOT A GUN
POINTED AT HER.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.158
- WELL, CAN'T THEY GET HIM
THROUGH THE WINDOW?

34:19.191 --> 34:21.560
- YOU DO NOT TAKE
THAT CHANCE.

34:21.593 --> 34:25.831
- EDDIE, HOW ABOUT WE LET
MY PARTNER COME IN HERE,

34:25.864 --> 34:26.832
AND WE'RE GONNA LET LILY GO.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.301
- NO, SHE'S MY GIRL.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.870
- OKAY.

34:31.903 --> 34:35.441
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT MY MOM CAME HERE.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.376
YOU KNOW, SHE USED TO BE
A BEAUTY QUEEN.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.479
I BET SHE HEARD
THERE WERE CAMERAS HERE.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.715
- WELL, I THINK
THAT SHE CARES ABOUT YOU.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.217
- SHE LEFT ME.

34:45.251 --> 34:48.554
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER
DOES THAT?

34:48.587 --> 34:50.356
- I KNOW THAT
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO.

34:50.389 --> 34:54.326
- DON'T MOTHER ME, OKAY?
I HAD A MOTHER.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.262
SHE'S A LIAR.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.863
- OKAY.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.670
WELL, YOUR SISTER
CARES ABOUT YOU.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.672
SHE TOLD ME
THAT SHE WROTE TO YOU

35:06.705 --> 35:09.708
AND SHE FACEBOOKED YOU,
BUT YOU DIDN'T RESPOND.

35:09.741 --> 35:13.312
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SHE MISSED ME SO MUCH.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.482
SHE COULD HAVE VISITED.
SHE NEVER CAME BACK.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.417
- SHE COULDN'T.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.719
YOUR FATHER TOLD HER
THAT IF SHE TRIED TO VISIT YOU,

35:20.752 --> 35:22.654
THAT HE WOULD CUT THEM OFF...

35:22.688 --> 35:24.223
AND YOU.

35:27.326 --> 35:30.362
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?

35:32.698 --> 35:34.433
- BECAUSE...

35:34.466 --> 35:36.835
HE DIDN'T WANT HER
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.804
- WHAT TRUTH?

35:38.837 --> 35:42.608
- THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHY THEY LEFT.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.776
EDDIE...

35:46.978 --> 35:50.282
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW OLD

35:50.316 --> 35:52.718
YOUR SISTER WAS
WHEN THEY LEFT?

35:52.751 --> 35:55.687
- 15.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.855
- THAT'S RIGHT.

35:56.888 --> 36:00.226
SHE WAS JUST STARTING
TO GROW UP.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.428
SHE WAS BECOMING A WOMAN.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.730
YOUR DAD--HE, UH...

36:06.732 --> 36:08.567
HE NOTICED THAT.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.738
YOUR SISTER TOLD ME
ABOUT THE GAME

36:12.771 --> 36:14.840
THAT YOUR FATHER USED
TO PLAY WITH YOU, UH,

36:14.873 --> 36:16.475
"MONSTER UNDER THE COVERS."
- YEAH.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.609
I KNOW IT, OKAY?

36:17.643 --> 36:20.212
WE STOPPED PLAYING THAT GAME
WHEN I WAS, LIKE, EIGHT.

36:20.246 --> 36:23.315
- YEAH, HE STOPPED
PLAYING THAT WITH YOU.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.351
BUT HE WAS STILL PLAYING
THAT WITH YOUR SISTER

36:25.384 --> 36:27.586
WHEN SHE WAS 15.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.294
SO YOUR MOTHER HAD TO GET HER

36:35.327 --> 36:37.296
AWAY FROM HIM.

36:37.329 --> 36:41.433
YOUR MOTHER
HAD TO PROTECT ALICIA.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.503
SHE COULDN'T SAVE
BOTH OF YOU, EDDIE.

36:46.472 --> 36:47.873
- WHAT?

36:47.906 --> 36:49.675
- EDDIE...

36:49.708 --> 36:52.811
YOUR MOTHER LOVES YOU.

36:52.844 --> 36:56.615
AND YOUR SISTER
LOVES YOU.

36:56.648 --> 37:00.319
YOUR SISTER WAS OUTSIDE.
SHE WAS CRYING...

37:00.352 --> 37:04.890
AND SAYING,
"HE'S MY LITTLE BROTHER.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.959
"I DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND...

37:07.993 --> 37:10.362
WITH HIM."

37:15.834 --> 37:17.869
- DID YOU TRY
TO GET HIM HERE?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.771
- I DID.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.640
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

37:24.510 --> 37:26.478
- HE WAS MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT HIMSELF

37:26.512 --> 37:28.580
THAN HE WAS WITH YOU.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.588
- DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT HE COULD DO THESE THINGS,

37:36.622 --> 37:39.257
THAT--THAT HE'S A BAD PERSON?

37:40.492 --> 37:44.563
- I'VE SEEN THAT PEOPLE
HAVE TWO SIDES.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.537
- IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM?

37:51.570 --> 37:54.973
- I THINK SO.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.709
YEAH.

37:57.743 --> 38:00.712
- BUT...

38:00.746 --> 38:02.714
BUT I'M HIS SON.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.752
- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE HIM.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.753
- NO!

38:07.786 --> 38:10.356
NO, I SHOT JESS.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.858
I HELD A GUN
TO LILY'S HEAD.

38:14.092 --> 38:17.629
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ME TOO.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.832
- YOU CAN MAKE
THIS RIGHT, EDDIE.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.001
YOU CAN LET LILY GO.

38:25.971 --> 38:29.741
EDDIE, LET'S LET
LILY GO RIGHT NOW.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.628
- CLOSE THE DOOR.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.035
- ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART,
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.604
- I GOT HER.
- YOU'RE SAFE.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.406
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.140
- YOU MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE, EDDIE.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.010
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- YES, IT DOES MATTER.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.513
JESS IS GOING TO BE OKAY,
LILY TOO, EDDIE.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.381
YOU AND ME--

39:09.415 --> 39:12.518
WE CAN WALK OUT
THAT DOOR RIGHT NOW.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.822
- NO.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.691
I'M JUST LIKE HIM.
I'M A MONSTER.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.593
- EDDIE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- YOU'LL SAY ANYTHING NOW.

39:21.627 --> 39:22.994
- NO, I WON'T.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.965
YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER, EDDIE.
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.600
EDDIE...

39:28.634 --> 39:31.470
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.405
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- EDDIE.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.776
- LET THEM DO IT.
- WHAT?

39:37.809 --> 39:39.678
NO.
- I GOT A SHOT.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.846
- NO, EDDIE, DON'T DO THIS!

39:40.879 --> 39:41.980
- HOLD YOUR FIRE!
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

39:42.013 --> 39:43.081
- WHY DO YOU CARE?

39:43.114 --> 39:46.852
- BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.186
- NO, YOU DON'T.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.689
- YES, EDDIE, I DO.

39:56.027 --> 40:00.632
MY FATHER DID
TERRIBLE THINGS TO WOMEN...

40:02.701 --> 40:04.903
TO MY OWN MOTHER.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.776
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.745
- EDDIE...

40:13.779 --> 40:15.814
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.955
I'M NOTHING
LIKE MY FATHER.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.661
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
LIKE YOURS.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.204
I WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME THE GUN.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.148
GIVE ME THE GUN.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.684
COME ON, COME ON.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.897
COMING OUT!

41:05.931 --> 41:08.500
I HAVE HIS WEAPON!

41:08.534 --> 41:10.468
HE'S UNARMED.

41:13.071 --> 41:16.074
PUT YOUR WEAPONS DOWN.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.743
- TAKE HIM.
- HEY!

41:17.776 --> 41:19.811
STOP!
IT'S OVER!

41:28.286 --> 41:30.856
- WATCH YOUR HEAD.

41:34.793 --> 41:36.628
[car door closes]

41:36.662 --> 41:39.197
- HOW'S JESS?
- SHE'S GOING TO MAKE IT.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.832
- AND THE LITTLE GIRL?

41:40.866 --> 41:42.167
- SHE'S SHAKEN, BUT OKAY.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.302
HER AUNT CAME IN FROM OHIO.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.304
- NICE JOB, DETECTIVE.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.039
