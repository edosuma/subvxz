WEBVTT

00:00.961 --> 00:02.253
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.462 --> 00:03.296
In the name
of King Roan,

00:03.713 --> 00:05.840
Polis is now
under Azgeda rule.

00:06.424 --> 00:08.009
The reason Alie created
the city of light,

00:08.218 --> 00:09.928
nuclear reactors
inside power plants

00:10.136 --> 00:11.680
that survived the bombs
are melting down.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.515
If we can't figure
out a way to fix it,

00:13.723 --> 00:15.183
all of us will be
dead in 6 months.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.102
There are a thousand
ice nation warriors

00:17.310 --> 00:18.937
on the street
who want to kill us today.

00:19.479 --> 00:20.313
They won't kill us.

00:20.522 --> 00:21.940
How could you
possibly know that?

00:22.148 --> 00:24.150
Roan, we need your help.
Something's coming.

00:24.359 --> 00:26.987
Our ancestors
survived Praimfaya.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.823
Not this time,
not without us.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.492
I, King Roan of Azgeda,
let it be known

00:32.701 --> 00:36.246
that an attack against Skaikru
is an attack against us all.

00:36.454 --> 00:39.124
We'll do our best to
keep the king on his throne.

00:39.332 --> 00:41.251
We'll find a way to
beat the radiation.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.211
If either of you
screw this up, we die.

00:43.378 --> 00:45.922
OK, princess.
What now?

00:47.757 --> 00:49.801
Now we survive.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.355
No.

01:30.467 --> 01:31.551
No.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.096
No!

01:39.934 --> 01:42.896
Do it. She'll break.

01:43.438 --> 01:44.230
No!

01:53.323 --> 01:54.032
No.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.368
Put the knife
to your own throat.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.624
No. Ohh...

02:02.832 --> 02:05.877
Clarke, don't.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.886
No.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.408
Yaah!

04:00.450 --> 04:03.536
You are a terrible
influence.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.125
Roan is
expecting me.

04:29.979 --> 04:30.855
Abby...

04:36.694 --> 04:38.655
Jake's a part
of who you are.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.632
Go. The king
needs you...

05:00.760 --> 05:02.303
But be careful.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.513
The tower's
safe enough,

05:03.680 --> 05:06.266
but we're on
dangerous ground here.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.590
Welcome to your
throne room, my king.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.760
Now that the lift
has been repaired,

06:24.010 --> 06:26.137
I've doubled the guard
on the doors at every floor.

06:26.346 --> 06:27.638
Expecting trouble?

06:27.889 --> 06:29.390
I trust only Azgeda.

06:30.183 --> 06:32.894
Your mother taught me that.
Our people loved her for it.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.979
Our people
feared her, Echo.

06:35.188 --> 06:38.566
Because she was fierce
and vicious.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.861
My mother's ambition,
her disregard

06:42.070 --> 06:44.989
for Lexa's alliance
got her killed.

06:45.198 --> 06:48.534
If I may, why do you
insist on ruling as Lexa did

06:48.743 --> 06:51.037
when it's not what's
best for our people?

06:51.245 --> 06:53.748
At least tell me
there's a reason.

06:55.792 --> 06:57.710
Forgive the intrusion,
your highness.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.380
May we have a word...

07:02.006 --> 07:02.799
Privately?

07:03.007 --> 07:05.968
You can wait
like the other ambassadors.

07:06.761 --> 07:07.929
Echo, leave us...

07:09.097 --> 07:09.931
Please.

07:20.942 --> 07:23.361
We were right to be
concerned about Trishanakru.

07:24.153 --> 07:26.447
Rafel is gonna
challenge you for control.

07:27.073 --> 07:28.908
Bold move for
a new ambassador.

07:32.203 --> 07:35.289
So? Let him come.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.750
With respect,
you're still recovering.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.335
The law says you
could pick someone

07:39.544 --> 07:40.253
to fight
in your place.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.587
No. The clans
will never accept

07:41.796 --> 07:43.464
a leader who hides
behind the law

07:43.673 --> 07:44.799
or another
warrior's blade.

07:45.007 --> 07:45.758
You'll lose.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.386
Lexa kicked your ass without
a bullet hole in your chest.

07:48.594 --> 07:50.763
We should
cancel the gathering

07:50.972 --> 07:53.099
or delay until
you're strong enough.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.351
No. Letting
the ambassadors

07:55.518 --> 07:57.687
have a voice keeps
the peace here.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.566
Azgeda holds this city
through force alone,

08:01.983 --> 08:03.985
and the flame won't keep
the clans at bay forever.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.903
If they unite
against us,

08:06.404 --> 08:08.406
we could lose,
and if we lose--

08:08.614 --> 08:09.907
they come
for Skaikru.

08:10.116 --> 08:12.243
And the radiation
comes for us all.

08:12.493 --> 08:13.744
No one has to die.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.329
The point of
our arrangement

08:15.496 --> 08:18.207
is to give us time to find
a solution to save everyone.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.501
And how is that
solution coming?

08:20.710 --> 08:21.961
We're working on it.

08:22.587 --> 08:25.214
In the meantime,
I'm here to keep you in power.

08:25.423 --> 08:27.216
Let me talk
to the ambassador.

08:27.717 --> 08:29.510
Go ahead.
Talk...

08:31.304 --> 08:32.138
But...

08:33.556 --> 08:35.016
If you fail,

08:35.892 --> 08:37.852
I'll have no choice
but to fight.

08:42.190 --> 08:43.357
We've been
at this for two days.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.860
There must be something
we're not thinking of.

08:46.068 --> 08:46.819
What if
we could reach

08:47.028 --> 08:48.446
the nearest
nuclear reactor?

08:48.654 --> 08:50.364
I told you, the meltdown
started months ago.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.909
There's no magic button
to turn them off.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.204
Today this isn't black rain,
but it will be soon.

08:57.121 --> 09:00.082
That's why we have to focus
on riding out the radiation,

09:00.291 --> 09:02.335
finding someplace safe
and big enough

09:02.543 --> 09:04.504
to hold all 500 of us.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.964
This isn't just
about saving us.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.510
I made a promise to Roan.
It's about saving everyone.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.095
And that's why
we need to tell everyone.

09:13.846 --> 09:14.931
Crowdsource it.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.058
If there's another
mount weather out there,

09:17.266 --> 09:18.768
the grounders
will know about it.

09:18.935 --> 09:20.478
And you think they're
just gonna tell us

09:20.645 --> 09:21.896
just like that?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.523
If we tell everybody
they're gonna die,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.441
the coalition
is over, Roan falls,

09:25.608 --> 09:27.318
and the grounders
will be at our gate.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.030
Then just
tell our people.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.366
We need more minds
on this problem.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.910
On the ark,
people volunteered

09:36.118 --> 09:38.120
for the culling because
they were told the truth

09:38.329 --> 09:40.164
and given a choice...

09:41.666 --> 09:43.960
A choice your dad
died for.

09:44.794 --> 09:46.379
You think I've
forgotten that?

09:46.587 --> 09:48.589
OK.
We'll tell everybody the truth

09:48.798 --> 09:51.801
as soon as we have
a viable solution.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.595
Without one,
it'll start a panic.

09:54.929 --> 09:56.889
- You don't know that.
- That's it.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.600
What are you
talking about?

09:59.809 --> 10:00.935
Think.

10:01.143 --> 10:04.063
Alpha station survived
for 97 years in space

10:04.689 --> 10:05.940
through elevated
radiation levels

10:06.148 --> 10:07.608
and extreme
temperature fluctuations.

10:08.401 --> 10:09.443
Sound familiar?

10:09.652 --> 10:11.445
All we have to do
is patch up the ship.

10:12.530 --> 10:15.283
We're standing
in our viable solution.

10:23.082 --> 10:24.500
Heh.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.590
Raven says we can
get it sealed up in a month.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.969
The ark is our ark.

10:35.177 --> 10:35.928
I get it.

10:36.137 --> 10:39.098
OK, so freeze-dried meat
until we can grow our own food.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.225
We got oxygen scrubbers,
but how do we store

10:41.434 --> 10:42.768
enough water
for 500 people?

10:42.977 --> 10:43.894
We don't.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.689
That's why we're
heading to farm station.

10:50.735 --> 10:52.194
Why the hell
would we do that?

10:52.361 --> 10:53.696
It's in the damn
ice nation.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.072
You just said it.

10:55.865 --> 10:58.034
We need
a hydro-generator,

10:59.076 --> 11:00.995
and farm station has
one for the crops.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.788
Think you can
get us there?

11:02.997 --> 11:05.333
No way.
Find another machine.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.043
Look. There are no others,
and without it,

11:07.251 --> 11:09.170
we won't last a year
inside this ship,

11:09.420 --> 11:11.213
let alone 5.

11:11.631 --> 11:13.674
Fine. I'm in.
Bryan stays here.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.468
His leg's
still healing.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.762
I'm in, too.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.308
Good.
We roll in an hour.

11:26.479 --> 11:28.022
You don't
have to do this.

11:29.023 --> 11:31.108
Actually,
yeah, I do.

11:31.317 --> 11:32.485
Since Octavia
murdered pike,

11:32.735 --> 11:34.320
I'm the only one left
who knows where it is.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.447
Why are you defending him?
Pike was a dictator.

11:36.656 --> 11:38.324
He was an elected
chancellor,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.034
and if you don't
care about that,

11:40.242 --> 11:42.119
he kept me alive
for 3 months.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.664
Then why did you help us turn
him over to the grounders?

11:47.458 --> 11:49.460
To save you, Nate.

11:57.093 --> 11:58.594
Sorry.

You know you're wasting

12:35.297 --> 12:37.174
You know we're all gonna
die in 6 months, right?

12:37.425 --> 12:38.843
Not if we find what
we're looking for today.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.344
Oh, please.

12:40.553 --> 12:41.804
Tell me about
another pointless task

12:42.012 --> 12:43.556
Clarke has
roped you into

12:43.764 --> 12:46.350
or, better yet,
don't.

12:46.559 --> 12:48.227
I don't want to keep
any more of her secrets.

12:48.436 --> 12:50.104
We're going back
to farm station.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.398
Why don't you
come with us?

12:53.566 --> 12:54.608
Monty...

12:56.610 --> 12:57.236
Look at me.

12:57.445 --> 12:58.487
I'm really
trying not to.

12:58.696 --> 13:00.156
I'm fine, all right?
I'm having fun.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.615
Jasper--

13:01.824 --> 13:03.492
I'm not gonna
kill myself--

13:03.701 --> 13:06.162
what's the point?--
But you know what?

13:08.330 --> 13:09.915
If you want
to cheer me up,

13:10.124 --> 13:11.208
while you're
at farm station,

13:11.792 --> 13:13.294
get that weed
we stashed

13:13.502 --> 13:15.254
behind the wall
of your old bedroom.

13:15.463 --> 13:16.756
Huh?

13:19.133 --> 13:21.135
Don't leave me
hanging, man. Just--

13:23.179 --> 13:24.680
yes.

13:26.682 --> 13:28.225
Music to my ears.

13:29.185 --> 13:31.645
Hey, you want a hug?

13:40.029 --> 13:42.323
Hey, uh,

13:42.490 --> 13:44.158
blueprint for
the hydro-generator,

13:44.366 --> 13:45.951
and don't forget, it's
filled with hydrazine

13:46.202 --> 13:47.787
that combines with
oxygen to make water,

13:47.995 --> 13:48.871
so go slow.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.414
Or the hydrazine
could go boom.

13:50.623 --> 13:53.083
I know.
Raven, I got this.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.127
Don't you have
a ship to fix?

13:57.254 --> 13:58.130
Battery's full.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.298
If we're lucky,

13:59.548 --> 14:00.800
we won't have
to stop to recharge.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.134
Even luckier
if Roan's seal will work

14:02.343 --> 14:03.552
the way it's supposed to.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.429
If you get in trouble,
just show this.

14:05.638 --> 14:08.182
Got it. Thanks.

14:08.766 --> 14:10.100
Load up.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.436
You can still
come with us.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.271
No. I can't.

14:14.522 --> 14:16.982
Arkadia is just plan "B."
It doesn't help the grounders.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.485
I'm not stopping
until we have a solution

14:19.735 --> 14:21.153
that saves everyone.

14:21.779 --> 14:23.405
We save who
we can save today.

14:26.242 --> 14:28.369
All right. Let's go.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.142
Uh!

14:52.685 --> 14:53.435
Uh!

14:54.645 --> 14:56.272
This is
as close as we can get.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.148
From here,
we go on foot.

14:58.858 --> 15:00.985
We get the machine
and get out of here.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.320
I don't want to stay here
any longer than we have to.

15:17.126 --> 15:18.878
Guys, got a problem.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.091
The barn isn't empty.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.387
They moved in.

15:28.596 --> 15:30.306
If it's the same
guys who attacked us,

15:30.514 --> 15:32.683
with our guns,
we could take them.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.727
I'm sure we could,

15:35.269 --> 15:36.979
but we didn't
come here to fight.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.774
They butchered us,
killed kids,

15:40.941 --> 15:43.777
our friends,
our families.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.654
I don't like it
any more than you do,

15:45.863 --> 15:47.156
but Bellamy's right.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.908
We need that machine.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.535
Uh, guys?

15:56.624 --> 15:59.168
Weapons down. Now.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.337
Now!

16:05.049 --> 16:07.468
Bryan, now.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.478
OK. It's just--

16:43.754 --> 16:45.464
where did you
get this?

16:45.673 --> 16:47.257
King Roan.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.594
Skaikru and Azgeda
are allies.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.054
He sent us to get

16:52.262 --> 16:54.890
a part of the ship,
a machine.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.152
Look.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.530
If we'd come
to take this place back,

17:09.780 --> 17:11.907
there'd be a lot more of us,
and you know that.

17:29.133 --> 17:32.261
Where is this machine
for the king?

17:33.387 --> 17:34.263
We've got
a lot of work to do

17:34.471 --> 17:36.056
to get the ship
ready for winter.

17:36.265 --> 17:37.891
Sector 4--
the crack in the outer wall,

17:38.308 --> 17:39.268
we need to patch it up.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.395
Start by repairing
the damaged panels.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.063
Sector 5--we need
to get that tree

17:43.272 --> 17:44.398
out of the hull
and seal it up.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.316
Any questions?

17:46.859 --> 17:49.862
OK. Go.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.533
You OK?

17:54.783 --> 17:56.160
There is so much
to do, and I get a total

17:56.410 --> 17:59.663
of 5 volunteers
to help me fix the ship?

18:00.664 --> 18:01.290
It's a start.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.667
I can't run this repair
alone, Clarke,

18:03.834 --> 18:05.753
even if I had
complete mobility,

18:07.046 --> 18:09.089
even if Sinclair
was still alive.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.425
Who--who the hell am I
giving them orders?

18:11.633 --> 18:14.219
I'm--I'm not
the chief.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.346
I'm not
the chancellor,

18:17.973 --> 18:19.725
but here we are.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.102
For what it's worth,
there's nobody

18:22.311 --> 18:24.688
I trust more
to do this than you.

18:24.897 --> 18:26.982
As soon as Bellamy gets
back with that machine,

18:27.191 --> 18:28.901
we go public
with everything

18:29.109 --> 18:31.153
and get you the help
that you need.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.614
Am I interrupting?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.203
What do you want?

18:39.411 --> 18:41.914
I was an engineer
before I was chancellor.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.500
I supervised the redesign
of sector 5.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.710
And how many people
died from sector 5

18:46.919 --> 18:48.212
in the culling
when you sucked

18:48.420 --> 18:50.214
the air
out of their lungs?

18:51.340 --> 18:52.883
42.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.176
Would you like
to know their names?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.597
Raven, wait.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.433
We could
use the help.

19:01.809 --> 19:03.685
You do know he
made me cut my wrist

19:03.894 --> 19:06.688
to force your mom
to take the chip, right?

19:07.731 --> 19:08.690
He was chipped, too.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.234
He searched for
the city of light.

19:10.442 --> 19:11.652
He brought Alie here.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.862
He showed her how to
overcome free will.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.281
Yes.
Those are my sins...

19:17.574 --> 19:19.409
And I have
to live with them.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.162
Raven...

19:28.460 --> 19:29.378
You want to help?

19:31.630 --> 19:33.465
Go sort the scrap.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.094
Whatever you need.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.279
Ever meet a grounder who
could power up a spaceship?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.969
Do what you came to do.

20:23.056 --> 20:23.932
No.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.812
Up there,
the generator.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.523
Let's go.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.034
Riley? Riley...

20:42.242 --> 20:43.410
Bryan, wait.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.661
We thought
you were dead.

20:46.872 --> 20:50.125
Only the machine.
The rest is ours.

20:58.342 --> 20:59.426
Come on.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.439
Ah!

21:12.648 --> 21:14.358
Huh! Agh...

21:14.566 --> 21:15.859
Agh...

21:19.029 --> 21:20.322
Let me
take a look.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.287
You're healing, but
you need more time.

21:27.496 --> 21:28.956
I don't have time.

21:51.103 --> 21:51.979
Rrgh...

21:55.732 --> 21:56.650
Oh!

21:58.402 --> 21:59.611
Uh!

22:06.827 --> 22:09.454
I would be honored to take
your place in this fight.

22:09.663 --> 22:11.707
I will not run
from this challenge.

22:13.417 --> 22:14.293
Echo's right.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.128
I didn't save your life
so that you

22:16.336 --> 22:17.587
could tear yourself
apart again.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.214
Since when are you two
on the same side?

22:19.423 --> 22:20.716
And if you
can't help me,

22:21.383 --> 22:22.926
why the hell
are you still here?

22:30.392 --> 22:31.852
This fight can
still be avoided.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.270
Protecting Skaikru
gives the other clans

22:33.478 --> 22:35.188
an excuse
to challenge you.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.732
Let me take care
of the problem.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.067
Let me do what your
mother would have done.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.111
No!

22:41.320 --> 22:42.863
Then please
just tell me,

22:43.030 --> 22:44.698
what did
Wanheda offer?

22:45.949 --> 22:47.576
What deal
is worth losing

22:47.784 --> 22:49.411
the faith
of your people?

22:50.162 --> 22:52.372
Chance to survive
the end of the world.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.460
That's what they're
offering to all of us.

22:57.294 --> 23:00.047
Soon, Praimfaya will once
again destroy everything.

23:00.756 --> 23:02.382
Skaikru's trying
to stop it.

23:02.591 --> 23:05.218
My king, they're
lying to you.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.472
They'd say anything
to save themselves.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.474
Let me
prove it to you.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.226
Send me to Arkadia.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.356
Your only concern now
should be helping me win.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.067
Once I do, you may
go to Arkadia,

23:20.609 --> 23:22.652
prove my trust
in Wanheda's deserved.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.718
Ambassador,

23:47.761 --> 23:49.221
may we speak privately?

23:50.555 --> 23:52.224
We know you plan
to challenge King Roan.

23:59.189 --> 24:02.025
I'd like to ask you
to reconsider.

24:02.234 --> 24:05.028
Ask? After everything
your people have done,

24:05.237 --> 24:06.530
you expect diplomacy?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.240
Skaikru's not
your enemy.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.583
Skaikru made me murder
my entire family.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.628
I have no one left.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.297
I'm sorry
for your loss,

24:25.882 --> 24:29.719
but the chip
technology,

24:31.054 --> 24:33.515
it affected all of
us, every clan.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.227
You blame Skaikru
for the city of light.

24:38.228 --> 24:42.149
Shouldn't you also credit
us for destroying it?

24:42.399 --> 24:44.025
After everything
we've suffered,

24:44.234 --> 24:45.861
why spill more blood?

24:46.069 --> 24:48.029
The clans are
stronger together.

24:48.196 --> 24:50.365
Heh. You see, Ilian?

24:50.740 --> 24:52.993
The king can't fight,
or his minions

24:53.201 --> 24:54.911
wouldn't be here
trying to stop us.

24:55.203 --> 24:57.247
If the king
wasn't hurt,

24:57.789 --> 25:00.167
do you think this coward
would give a crap

25:00.375 --> 25:01.585
about your family?

25:01.835 --> 25:03.044
Since you
landed here, your people

25:03.211 --> 25:04.504
have done nothing
but rip our world apart.

25:04.713 --> 25:05.839
Rafel, I urge you--

25:06.047 --> 25:07.507
you reap what
you sow, ambassador.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.968
The time of Skaikru
is over.

25:22.189 --> 25:23.607
Well, that went well.

25:31.823 --> 25:34.117
Oh, there's
too many people.

26:44.104 --> 26:44.980
I'm trying to make
sure that we have

26:45.230 --> 26:46.731
more than 6 months,
which is why

26:46.982 --> 26:48.525
these people need
to get back to work.

26:49.109 --> 26:50.443
I didn't force them
to stop.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.280
I guess they think
it's the end of the day,

26:53.488 --> 26:55.615
not, you know,
the end of days.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.243
Don't you want us
to survive, Jasper?

26:58.451 --> 26:59.953
No. I don't want
us to survive.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.455
I want us to live.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.499
If we don't
repair that ship,

27:04.708 --> 27:06.167
none of us will
have that chance.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.877
And what about
free will?

27:08.086 --> 27:09.921
That's why you
destroyed Alie, right?

27:10.130 --> 27:11.673
Why don't you tell
them all the truth?

27:11.923 --> 27:13.425
Keep
your voice down.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.926
Should let them decide

6 months.

27:20.265 --> 27:22.392
We can't just go to them
with no solutions.

27:22.726 --> 27:23.643
People will panic.

27:23.852 --> 27:25.645
Ah, I see. Hmm.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.023

28:02.057 --> 28:03.600
We're in
the coalition now,

28:03.933 --> 28:05.018
so we ask the king
to free them.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.353
That's our best bet.

28:06.561 --> 28:07.729
Not if it means
leaving Riley.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.272
No. We won't,
OK, but Harper's right.

28:09.689 --> 28:10.649
We try diplomacy first.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.484
If that doesn't work,
we come back

28:12.692 --> 28:14.778
with reinforcements
for the slaves

28:14.986 --> 28:17.572
after we take home
the machine, right?

28:17.781 --> 28:18.948
Yeah.

28:36.508 --> 28:37.926
They're moving them.

28:39.302 --> 28:40.804
Hey, it's now
or never.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.682
Are there any other
exits in here?

28:43.890 --> 28:45.392
No. This is
completely sealed.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.768
Came down from space
in here

28:47.018 --> 28:48.186
because it's the most secure
room in the ship.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.771
It's designed
that way

28:50.230 --> 28:51.898
in case
the hydrazine blew.

28:52.857 --> 28:53.775
What?

28:55.151 --> 28:56.486
We have a bomb.

28:58.530 --> 28:59.406
Wait a second.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.324
The end of the world is coming,
and you want to destroy

29:01.533 --> 29:03.159
the one thing that'll
keep our people alive?

29:03.368 --> 29:04.869
Yeah. Not all
of our people.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.705
What about Riley?

29:06.913 --> 29:09.207
I vote that
we take it home.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.001
No. Blow it up.

29:12.836 --> 29:13.795
I'm with Bryan.

29:14.003 --> 29:16.423
I know what it's like
to be locked up and afraid.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.843
You didn't leave us
in mount weather.

29:20.176 --> 29:21.720
We shouldn't
leave them here.

29:24.097 --> 29:25.265
Can we build
another machine?

29:25.473 --> 29:27.559
No way. The tech's
too advanced.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.061
We have 6 months.
We have Raven.

29:30.228 --> 29:31.271
Are you telling me
she can't figure out

29:31.479 --> 29:32.522
another way
to make water?

29:32.731 --> 29:34.107
Yes. Look.

29:34.733 --> 29:36.526
I know you want to make up
for the things you've done--

29:37.193 --> 29:38.611
believe me, we all do--

29:38.820 --> 29:40.697
but we need to think
of the big picture--

29:41.364 --> 29:44.117
25 people instead of 500.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.453
We're talking about
the human race, Bellamy.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.037
We need to get this machine
back to Arkadia.

29:48.246 --> 29:49.664
It's the only way.

29:49.873 --> 29:52.459
It's two to two,
your call, Bellamy.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.086
What's it gonna be?

30:22.614 --> 30:24.491
- Watch it, Miller.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.659
Just set it down here.

30:32.791 --> 30:33.625
Now!

30:36.628 --> 30:39.172
- Bryan, come on!
- Run! Move! Move!

30:51.434 --> 30:53.019
- Uh!
- Uh!

30:58.525 --> 30:59.943
- Uh!
- Rrgh!

31:02.362 --> 31:05.073
OK, Nate. This isn't your kill.
This isn't your kill.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.658
Uh!

31:06.866 --> 31:08.493
This is Monty's kill.

31:08.660 --> 31:09.911
What are you
talking about?

31:10.995 --> 31:13.331
This is the man that
murdered your father.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.001
Uhh...

31:27.720 --> 31:28.805
You don't have
to do this.

31:29.013 --> 31:31.432
Yeah. I do.

31:34.727 --> 31:38.147
Hrah! Huh! Huh!

31:48.449 --> 31:50.743
Rrgh...Rrgh...

31:54.080 --> 31:55.164
Aah! Aah!

31:55.331 --> 31:58.126
Get off! Aah! Aah!

31:58.334 --> 32:02.213
Get off!
Get off! Aah!

32:07.385 --> 32:10.889
Raven? Raven, you here?

32:11.472 --> 32:14.142
Polyethylene
silicone elastomers.

32:15.059 --> 32:17.478
We don't need that
for a winter storm

32:17.687 --> 32:19.939
or to protect us
from a grounder attack.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.860
What are we really
bracing Alpha station for?

32:33.620 --> 32:35.580
Heavy
lies the crown.

32:37.916 --> 32:41.711
I know the burden
of keeping a secret

32:41.920 --> 32:44.047
you think is going
to destroy your people.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.965
You locked me up.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.178
You floated my father.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.722
And now you
understand why.

32:54.182 --> 32:57.018
No leader starts out
wanting to lie

32:57.602 --> 33:01.439
or imprison or execute
their people.

33:01.648 --> 33:05.151
The decisions you face
just whittle you down

33:05.318 --> 33:08.404
piece by piece.

33:13.868 --> 33:15.244
So what do I do?

33:15.453 --> 33:16.871
I'll tell you what
I told your mother

33:17.038 --> 33:18.581
after the culling.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.627
We make the best
decisions that we can

33:22.835 --> 33:25.380
with the information
that we have,

33:26.214 --> 33:29.175
then hope that there's
a forgiving God.

33:43.690 --> 33:45.149
Can Roan fight?

33:45.692 --> 33:47.151
It's too soon.

33:48.236 --> 33:49.737
One simple task,
and I'm failing.

33:49.946 --> 33:52.115
No. You'll
figure it out.

33:52.365 --> 33:53.533
Hmm.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.331
What's wrong?

34:04.460 --> 34:07.130
There's nothing more
that I can do for Roan.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.382
Ah.

34:09.632 --> 34:13.136
You need to go back
to Arkadia, to Clarke.

34:22.437 --> 34:23.896
Your necklace.

34:55.053 --> 34:56.554
What the hell
do you want?

34:56.763 --> 34:58.389
I'm here to ask you

34:58.598 --> 35:00.933
one last time to back down.

35:01.184 --> 35:03.561
Hmm, you trying
to frighten me,

35:03.770 --> 35:04.771
little girl?

35:04.979 --> 35:07.523
If your problem
really is with Skaikru,

35:07.732 --> 35:11.486
not Roan, then
challenge me instead.

35:12.361 --> 35:13.404
We can settle this.

35:13.613 --> 35:17.784
Ha ha! You're not
worth my blade.

35:19.827 --> 35:22.163
I came here
to change your mind.

35:22.497 --> 35:25.374
Hmm. You can't.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.753
Trishanakru will
have its justice.

35:29.837 --> 35:31.297
Now leave before I--

35:49.857 --> 35:51.859
long live the king.

36:17.260 --> 36:20.638
Roan, please, it's not
too late to cancel.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.766
You failed.
We do this Azgeda's way.

36:26.102 --> 36:27.478
Take your seat,
ambassador.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.569
Where is Rafel
Kom Trishanakru?

36:59.010 --> 37:01.679
The ambassador was found
dead this morning.

37:01.888 --> 37:03.181
His heart stopped.

37:17.612 --> 37:19.280
Let us begin.

37:21.824 --> 37:23.034
You gonna
kill me, too?

37:23.451 --> 37:25.161
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:32.835 --> 37:35.087
I honor Lexa Kom Trikru.

37:37.548 --> 37:39.592
We are stronger together.

37:55.399 --> 37:56.567
Hey, Bry...

37:59.362 --> 38:00.613
We OK?

38:01.989 --> 38:03.449
Just tell me
you think

38:03.658 --> 38:05.534
saving these people
was worth it.

38:06.869 --> 38:08.329
I wish I could.

38:10.998 --> 38:12.750
Hey--
- I can't.

38:12.959 --> 38:15.336
I can't.
I'm sorry.

38:15.544 --> 38:16.545
Bryan--

38:41.696 --> 38:42.613
uh!

38:48.995 --> 38:50.663
Riley?

38:50.871 --> 38:52.206
Clarke.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.791
Riley...

38:54.000 --> 38:56.335
I can't believe
you're alive.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.379
I am now.

39:02.675 --> 39:04.385
Get Riley
and the others to Medbay

39:05.011 --> 39:06.012
and tell them
we'll take them

39:06.220 --> 39:07.972
to their villages
in the morning.

39:15.021 --> 39:16.022
Where is it?

39:16.772 --> 39:18.357
We didn't
get the machine.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.276
It didn't
survive landing?

39:20.484 --> 39:23.696
No. It did,
but I had a choice--

39:24.405 --> 39:28.242
bring the machine home
or use it to save them.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.162
Oh, we are
so screwed.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.665
We have time,
but I am not sacrificing

39:34.874 --> 39:36.167
any more innocent lives.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.626
You just did.

39:38.836 --> 39:40.421
I made the call,
and I'll live with that.

39:40.629 --> 39:41.422
Yeah. You're
not the only one

39:41.630 --> 39:43.090
who has to live
with your call,

39:43.466 --> 39:44.550
as usual.

39:44.759 --> 39:46.218
Well, go tell them.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.721
Go tell Riley
I should've left them to die.

39:48.929 --> 39:52.099
OK. How many of us
will the ship sustain

39:52.308 --> 39:53.934
without
a hydro-generator?

39:54.769 --> 39:56.270
No more than a hundred.

39:59.774 --> 40:01.776
What am I supposed
to tell the people now?

40:02.485 --> 40:03.944
The truth.

40:04.779 --> 40:06.906
Crowdsource it
like we talked about.

40:09.909 --> 40:11.243
Call for
a general meeting.

40:14.914 --> 40:16.207
What are you
gonna do?

40:18.542 --> 40:20.920
Hope that there's
a forgiving God.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.382
So now you know
the truth.

40:25.383 --> 40:27.051
I know you're afraid.

40:27.635 --> 40:30.721
I know you're angry,
but when I shut down Alie,

40:30.930 --> 40:34.850
I knew there was a way for us
to get through this together.

40:38.729 --> 40:41.524
Alpha station is that way.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.362
Every single one of us

40:47.029 --> 40:49.407
will survive on this ship.

40:50.783 --> 40:52.201
It won't be easy.

40:52.410 --> 40:55.788
Raven needs volunteers if we're
gonna get it ready in time.

40:57.164 --> 40:58.666
It'll be a lot of work,

40:58.874 --> 41:01.752
but now you understand
why we need to do it.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.381
If we stick together,

41:06.424 --> 41:08.300
I give you my word,

41:09.427 --> 41:11.720
we won't just survive.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.932
We'll thrive.

41:22.565 --> 41:23.858
Nice speech.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.777
Sometimes hope is
more important than truth.

41:27.153 --> 41:29.155
You dad would be
so proud.

41:30.239 --> 41:32.283
You wanted workers.
You got them.

41:41.292 --> 41:44.044
Everyone
to the hangar bay. Now.

41:48.591 --> 41:50.801
We save who
we can save today.
