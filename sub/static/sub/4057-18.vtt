WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:02.537
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.562 --> 00:05.848
Deputy, it's time
you and your alter ego,

00:05.873 --> 00:07.551
had a proper introduction.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.387
Whoever's lurking inside
the Beast is wearing a size 10

00:10.411 --> 00:12.021
with Parrish's
blood on the sole.

00:12.045 --> 00:13.657
Are you saying that thing's
going to be out there tonight?

00:13.681 --> 00:14.925
I'm saying...
People are going to die.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.660
Did you find what you
were looking for?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.005
No.

00:18.029 --> 00:19.350
But I found something that
would answer the question.

00:19.374 --> 00:20.718
Who is the Beast?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.671
"Dear Marie-Jeanne,

01:18.695 --> 01:20.857
"I wish I had better
news to report.

01:20.881 --> 01:24.661
"But even with the support
of our Indian allies,

01:24.685 --> 01:27.697
"we are losing this
war to the British.

01:27.721 --> 01:31.468
"We have heard news
that Montreal has fallen.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.738
"Marcel and I has
both suffered injuries.

01:34.762 --> 01:38.541
"All that keeps us alive is the
hope of seeing our home again,

01:38.565 --> 01:40.966
"and of seeing you, my sister."

02:27.681 --> 02:28.780
You can't be here.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.664
You don't understand.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.633
You've come
to the wrong place to hide.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.834
Quiet.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.436
There's something out there.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.504
Something other than
the British soldiers.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.761
What do you mean other?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.774
A creature of the night.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.997
Don't listen to her.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.101
A shapeshifter.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.848
A demon.

02:51.872 --> 02:52.949
What kind?

02:52.973 --> 02:54.039
Sebastien...

02:55.676 --> 02:57.887
What kind of demon?

02:57.911 --> 02:59.678
A Demon-Wolf.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.034
Open the door!

03:57.438 --> 03:59.104
For God's sake, open the door!

04:00.007 --> 04:01.017
Please!

04:01.041 --> 04:02.474
Open!

04:02.876 --> 04:04.109
Help!

04:16.656 --> 04:18.902
That letter would
eventually find its way

04:18.926 --> 04:21.171
into the hands of a young woman.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.873
A skilled hunter who would
later face the Beast

04:23.897 --> 04:27.165
armed with nothing
but a steel-tipped pike.

04:51.859 --> 04:55.205
She would be known by
history as the Maid of Gevaudan.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.195
But her real name
was Marie-Jeanne.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.986
Maybe someone
should resurrect her.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.188
Don't leave.

06:03.212 --> 06:04.572
My dreams
aren't like yours, Lydia.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.632
I'm not just
a harbinger of death.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.101
I'm the cause of it.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.938
Jordan... Let him go.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.303
Why?

06:18.327 --> 06:20.847
Because as much as we believe
Parrish could take on the Beast...

06:23.283 --> 06:25.483
neither of us think he's
our only hope at stopping it.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.764
What do you mean?

06:27.788 --> 06:29.254
We think there's another.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.726
You.

06:47.674 --> 06:48.740
Come on, come on.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.746
The desk, the desk!

06:59.820 --> 07:01.598
Okay, okay.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.655
Liam. I'm okay. I'm fine.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.341
What? Is it bad?

07:11.365 --> 07:12.664
- No.
- Very.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.181
Okay. Okay.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.216
What do you guys
usually do when this happens?

07:20.240 --> 07:21.818
Oh, I usually pass out.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.308
And I think I still
might do that.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.090
Stiles!

07:27.114 --> 07:28.246
Okay, okay.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.026
Okay.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.294
Scott did this with pain.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.395
He could trigger it.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.696
Pain makes you human.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.963
He's already in pain.

07:34.987 --> 07:36.232
Right, okay, but maybe
adding a little more

07:36.256 --> 07:37.822
could help take away the pain.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.327
Take away his pain.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.149
Next time I'll kiss him.

08:14.027 --> 08:17.373
Marie-Jeanne was a lot
like you, Lydia.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.809
Skeptical of her own abilities.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.867
And once, actually, just as
skeptical of the supernatural.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.973
Merci, Marie-Jeanne.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.161
Don't give up hope.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.178
Her name was Agnes.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.047
She was eleven-years-old.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.348
Eleven.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.016
Torn limb from limb.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.452
There wasn't enough of her
left for a proper burial.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.954
I am well aware.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.156
I'm also aware
that every new report

09:40.180 --> 09:41.758
conflicts with the last.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.360
Some say it is
part hyena, part wolf.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.096
It has red fur, black fur,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.499
cloven hooves,
a stripe down its back.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.367
We know it kills at night.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.835
It targets the head and neck.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.870
This we know for sure.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.821
It won't stop.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.774
Where the wolf finds a lamb,
there he seeks another.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.510
But it never eats its victims.
It kills for sport.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.845
No animal kills for sport.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.302
This is no animal.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.250
Tell that to the King.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.254
I have word he may send a contingent
of his own professional hunters.

10:11.278 --> 10:15.525
Until then, we can use
volunteers for a hunting party.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.260
Especially, someone to lead it.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.128
Why ask for a volunteer?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.820
We all know who the best
hunter is in Gevaudan.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.469
Marie-Jeanne Valet.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.826
My sister.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.228
Bastard!

10:44.477 --> 10:46.289
Good to have you back, Marcel.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.890
Don't worry, my friend.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.614
You still have a job.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.285
I am not going to argue with
your brother, Marie-Jeanne.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.254
What do you say?

10:58.525 --> 11:01.025
Marie-Jeanne! Marie-Jeanne!

11:04.965 --> 11:06.130
Well?

11:07.033 --> 11:08.299
Will you heed their call?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.269
I hunt animals. Not rumors.

11:47.507 --> 11:48.573
Emile?

11:53.246 --> 11:54.312
Emile?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.616
Mon Dieu, my son.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.320
Emile.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.372
I found him in the woods.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.396
He whispered
his last words to me.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.564
What were they?

12:14.100 --> 12:15.199
La Bete.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.537
The Beast.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.707
Monsieur Tolbert,

12:24.144 --> 12:26.444
I do not know
what creature did this.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.249
But the hunting party
leaves at dawn.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.281
Why didn't he warn her?

12:52.305 --> 12:55.173
He told her about everything
that they'd seen during the war.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.220
But like I said,

12:58.244 --> 13:00.144
Marie-Jeanne was a skeptic.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.122
You believe it?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.659
I never knew
you were so superstitious.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.764
I don't need to believe in
something I saw with my own eyes.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.581
And I've been through
every inch of these woods

13:25.605 --> 13:28.150
and hunted just about
every creature under the sun.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.374
But not the moon.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.411
Are you trying to frighten me?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.290
I'm trying to warn you.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.034
You're gonna need more than
ordinary steel to stop the Beast.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.305
They searched
from dawn till dusk,

14:56.329 --> 14:59.575
hoping to find
the Beast where it slept.

14:59.599 --> 15:04.235
But they knew they'd most
likely only encounter it at nightfall.

15:08.308 --> 15:12.176
It was just after midnight
when the first torch went out.

16:33.726 --> 16:34.792
Get down!

16:56.950 --> 16:59.617
That... That was no wolf!

17:01.454 --> 17:02.954
Of course not, you fool.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.260
It was a werewolf.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.752
Where's Stiles?

17:23.776 --> 17:25.103
Look at me!

17:25.127 --> 17:26.686
Do you know who Stiles is?
I don't know.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.262
Braeden, it's me.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.264
I'm at the school
and we need you.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.932
Bring your shotgun.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.422
Bring all your shotguns.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.045
Go. Go out the window!

18:23.069 --> 18:24.368
Go!

18:26.639 --> 18:28.806
Go!

18:44.691 --> 18:45.756
Lydia?

18:48.494 --> 18:49.660
Something's happening.

18:50.930 --> 18:51.974
Now?

18:51.998 --> 18:53.409
I don't know.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.498
But something's wrong.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.713
I can't stay here.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.049
You should hear
the rest of the story.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.651
Why should I be
listening to you?

19:02.675 --> 19:05.454
He knows it
better than any of us.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.046
Everything I've read says that the
Beast was killed by Jean Chastel.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.393
Who told you that?

19:11.417 --> 19:13.529
The Internet?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.854
If that's your most reliable
source of information,

19:17.757 --> 19:19.490
then you might as well go.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.561
What happened next?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.080
Henri brought
Marie-Jeanne to his home.

19:31.104 --> 19:34.372
A place protected by a circle
of Mountain Ash trees.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.781
What is this?

19:46.552 --> 19:47.852
Mountain Ash.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.692
And that?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.438
Mistletoe.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.129
Please, put that down.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.774
Why do you have all of this?

20:13.479 --> 20:14.712
To protect myself.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.661
I have spent,

20:19.685 --> 20:22.296
half a lifetime

20:22.320 --> 20:24.954
gathering the implements and
skills to survive a werewolf.

20:29.662 --> 20:33.798
I can teach you
if you want to know.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.443
I do not care
about surviving one.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.712
I want to know how to kill one.

21:49.675 --> 21:50.841
Go upstairs!

22:23.576 --> 22:25.587
Marie-Jeanne knew
she couldn't just take out

22:25.611 --> 22:26.822
another hunting party

22:26.846 --> 22:29.591
armed with mistletoe
and rowan berries.

22:29.615 --> 22:33.050
She needed an advantage.
She needed to know her enemy.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.220
To honor the dead.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.689
I expect everyone to drink.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.683
To the dead.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.319
To the dead!

23:28.941 --> 23:30.185
Marcel.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.742
I have got him.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.181
Come, Marcel. Out to the well.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.350
Do you have any cloth?

24:01.374 --> 24:02.718
Something to wrap your hand?

24:02.742 --> 24:03.819
Yes.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.175
In the cellar.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.954
You'll find what
you're looking for

24:17.289 --> 24:18.722
in the cellar.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.427
Go ahead.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.430
Release the arrow.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.167
Do it, Marie-Jeanne.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.839
Go ahead. Let the arrow fly.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.742
Release it, Marie-Jeanne.

25:47.847 --> 25:48.912
Please.

25:56.922 --> 25:58.188
Release me.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.033
You're not the killer.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.437
You're covering for him.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.820
Marie-Jeanne confronted
her brother

26:51.844 --> 26:54.011
the moment she walked
back into the Tavern.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.869
You have killed children.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.407
I kill whatever dares
to cross my path.

27:24.243 --> 27:25.453
Why?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.022
It's what I am.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.278
What I've become.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.059
You've heard the old story
of what happens

27:31.083 --> 27:34.051
when you drink rainwater
from the paw print of a wolf.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.525
You become the Demon-Wolf.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.034
Go.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.314
Go ahead.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.571
Tell them it's me.

28:28.674 --> 28:33.221
Then watch me tear them apart
in a matter of moments.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.380
Every last soul in this place.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.149
You're a monster.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.319
Beast, Marie-Jeanne.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.154
The Beast.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.567
You won't catch me.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.207
And you won't kill me.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.046
We're family, Marie-Jeanne.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.283
We're family.

29:26.532 --> 29:29.945
The skeptic became
a full believer that night.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.113
So Marie-Jeanne
went back to Henri

29:32.137 --> 29:35.505
to figure out how to kill
both a Beast and a brother.

29:39.678 --> 29:41.378
One bolt may not be enough.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.515
We need something
that cuts deeper.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.162
A sword?

29:47.186 --> 29:48.697
An axe?

29:48.721 --> 29:52.522
Something that uses the weight
of the Beast against itself.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.432
I think I may have
a possibility.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.246
You didn't seriously think
you were gonna have a chance

32:18.270 --> 32:19.503
against that thing, did you?

32:21.140 --> 32:22.205
No.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.611
But I got its scent.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.474
Marie-Jeanne hunted
Sebastien for three years

32:46.498 --> 32:50.300
until she finally
cornered him in 1767.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.893
Nowhere left to run, sister.

34:42.781 --> 34:46.628
You think this
minor injury will stop me?

34:46.652 --> 34:50.420
I'm the famous and feared
Beast of Gevaudan.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.333
And when I'm done killing,

34:53.358 --> 34:55.270
everyone will know.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.739
I will have done such horrors,

34:57.763 --> 35:00.964
and all of history
will remember my name.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.900
No one will remember.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.716
Damnatio Memoriae?

35:08.740 --> 35:11.308
You would have them
take my name?

35:11.910 --> 35:13.310
Our name?

35:20.552 --> 35:22.652
What? What is this?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.423
No ordinary steel.

35:28.593 --> 35:31.039
Wolfsbane and Mountain Ash,

35:31.063 --> 35:32.774
forged with our blood

35:32.798 --> 35:34.731
under the light of a full moon.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.937
History might remember
you, Sebastien.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.678
But only as a Beast.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.700
Damnatio Memoriae.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.470
They erased every detail of him.

36:35.494 --> 36:38.873
Everything he signed,
everything he owned.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.030
They burned it all.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.571
The name Sebastien
Valet has been forgotten

37:10.595 --> 37:12.673
for over 150 years,

37:12.697 --> 37:14.475
but when it's remembered...

37:14.499 --> 37:18.568
When the Beast remembers,
the teenager inside is forgotten.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.970
Gone. Forever.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.941
But Marie-Jeanne
didn't do it alone.

37:26.178 --> 37:27.911
She was never alone.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.625
She had help from Henri,

37:30.649 --> 37:31.926
the Magistrate,

37:31.950 --> 37:33.116
the town,

37:34.052 --> 37:35.618
even Marcel.

37:37.189 --> 37:38.755
We need Parrish.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.802
I'm going to go find him.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.117
Lydia, he's dangerous.

37:56.141 --> 37:58.118
He's still a shapeshifter.

37:58.142 --> 38:00.222
And one who's just beginning
to understand his power.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.059
And I'm not?

38:05.083 --> 38:07.195
You're not the same.

38:07.219 --> 38:10.498
You access the supernatural.
It works through you.

38:10.522 --> 38:11.799
But it doesn't control you.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.022
How would you know?

38:14.192 --> 38:16.103
Why do you care?

38:16.127 --> 38:18.628
Why are you
suddenly on our side?

38:27.239 --> 38:29.739
Because it's my name as well.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.600
Marie-Jeanne never left Henri

38:45.624 --> 38:47.935
after the death of her brother.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.060
And their relationship become
more than a partnership.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.064
They married
and she took his name.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.176
Argent.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.282
Marie-Jeanne

39:15.020 --> 39:16.819
was the first hunter.

39:18.323 --> 39:21.602
Our name will be
remembered as well, Lydia.

39:21.626 --> 39:23.159
For killing the Beast.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.665
But I'm not an Argent.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.104
And I'm not Allison.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.791
Scott, wait.

39:43.815 --> 39:44.881
You're hurt.

39:46.785 --> 39:47.984
You gotta slow down.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.363
Scott?

40:34.332 --> 40:35.965
What are you doing to my car?

40:39.371 --> 40:40.637
It's you.

40:42.374 --> 40:43.706
What?

40:45.343 --> 40:47.076
Liam, what's he talking about?

40:50.715 --> 40:51.781
Liam?

40:58.990 --> 41:00.256
Corey, wait!

41:01.860 --> 41:03.126
Corey, wait!
