00:45.642 --> 00:49.309
I knew it vildas force.

00:54.350 --> 00:59.392
He dreamed that we would get the desert to blossom again.

01:43.559 --> 01:48.600
I grew as a weed on Ireland's wild hayfields

01:48.683 --> 01:54.308
- Where Europe's last cliffs plunge into the sea.

01:55.350 --> 01:59.308
Where I grew up we knew that man's nature.

01:59.392 --> 02:03.100
Natural, human-same thing.

02:13.350 --> 02:18.350
Loved Hawthorn. It made me see.

02:18.433 --> 02:21.725
It opened the world to me.

02:24.308 --> 02:29.850
Think about your childhood all the wild places was gone ...

02:29.933 --> 02:33.767
But that's not the story.

02:33.850 --> 02:37.058
This is my story.

02:37.142 --> 02:39.517
Mary? Mary!

02:42.683 --> 02:45.100
Mary!

02:51.475 --> 02:55.433
I keep an eye on you. You can do what you want

02:55.517 --> 02:59.767
But stay away from fairies field.

03:30.392 --> 03:33.225
Do not be afraid.

03:36.058 --> 03:41.058
Imagine if you were a child who had never believed in fairies.

03:41.142 --> 03:45.058
But I have seen the earth spirits.

03:46.558 --> 03:48.767
Do not be afraid.

04:00.225 --> 04:06.975
Think about everything that grew, blossomed and fed us turned into desert.

04:12.600 --> 04:18.850
Do not be afraid, Mary. It's just me. I told you that you would not come here alone.

04:18.933 --> 04:23.183
- Dad, I saw the sparkling light. - I know.

04:23.266 --> 04:28.516
I saw the same light when I was little. Earth live, as ap-

04:28.600 --> 04:34.975
- And the stone circle is not only created by nature, but by man.

04:37.058 --> 04:41.308
We are all together. Come now.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.433
Dad said that we are destroying the earth.

04:51.558 --> 04:55.516
That everything we hold dear to disappear.

04:56.516 --> 05:00.975
Even the fairies field had lost its magic.

05:02.516 --> 05:05.183
Assholes!

05:18.850 --> 05:24.516
- I want to dye your hair like that. - No, it's not a good look.

05:27.308 --> 05:32.850
I have always been able to design as nature intended.

05:32.933 --> 05:37.225
I just wanted to get my ideas in values.

05:39.808 --> 05:43.141
But then I have to leave the wild nature.

05:43.933 --> 05:46.808
DUBLIN, IRELAND

06:05.266 --> 06:10.308
Have your hair too much color? I look like a speedad Marie Antoinette.

06:10.391 --> 06:13.516
I never get the job! I'm terrified, Eve.

06:13.599 --> 06:18.683
You need to get the job. She is a celebrity florist.

06:18.766 --> 06:22.349
- What if she does not like me. - Only she hires you.

06:22.433 --> 06:25.683
- You get to meet Madonna. - I do not want to.

06:25.766 --> 06:30.433
Everything is about contacts. That is how to spread their ideas.

06:30.516 --> 06:34.599
This is why you should ring.

06:36.724 --> 06:40.849
I hope that you are wearing business clothes?

06:40.933 --> 06:44.349
- I get vibes. - Stop now.

06:55.224 --> 06:57.974
Flowering Hawthorn.

06:59.224 --> 07:01.099
Fine.

07:01.183 --> 07:04.808
- Did it go well? - Yes ...

07:04.891 --> 07:08.266
- I'm looking for Shah. -

07:09.391 --> 07:12.016
- There.

07:21.308 --> 07:27.308
- Mary Reynolds, landscape ... - Perfect for the green ball, Christy.

07:27.391 --> 07:29.849
Okay. Bye.

07:35.933 --> 07:41.891
Which copies, huh? He is dating just extraordinary women.

07:41.974 --> 07:45.058
If only he had a little ...

07:48.641 --> 07:51.683
Is it your design?

07:55.141 --> 08:02.099
I believe that man's nature, human nature. A unit.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.266
Top.

08:09.641 --> 08:13.057
This is promising.

08:16.641 --> 08:19.724
Has anyone else seen these?

08:28.224 --> 08:32.765
- You are a wonderful florist. - I'm not a florist.

08:32.849 --> 08:37.349
I am the rage in garden design.

08:37.432 --> 08:42.849
I have been so busy that I would need some help.

08:44.891 --> 08:48.182
I would be happy to help you.

08:50.099 --> 08:53.766
You must remove the paint. Keep it blond.

08:53.849 --> 08:58.807
- Have I got the job? - Yes, to the test.

09:27.016 --> 09:30.016
Mary is finished?

09:33.766 --> 09:35.016
Tack.

09:35.932 --> 09:42.516
- Dr. Finch, what do you say about your garden? - I want a seductive garden.

09:43.391 --> 09:48.849
- What will the garden say about you? - Success.

09:48.974 --> 09:51.516
Prestige.

09:57.974 --> 10:02.515
- You can not stay here in the middle of nowhere! - I do not like it in town.

10:02.599 --> 10:06.974
- You can lie here dead for several weeks. - Watch the magic Hawthorn.

10:07.057 --> 10:10.932
You know what Hawthorn symbolize? Hope.

10:15.182 --> 10:20.557
Madden, rock star, what do you want the garden to say about you?

10:20.640 --> 10:26.057
I want the garden to say: "Save Our Planet!"

10:26.140 --> 10:28.724
I can make it cool.

10:33.849 --> 10:36.807
Take a little bit, I command.

10:38.182 --> 10:43.599
When we come to the office, we can develop a design to Madden's garden.

10:43.682 --> 10:49.307
Madden need a powerful garden. Shall we have lunch with Madden someday?

10:49.474 --> 10:52.849
- Are you serious? - Yes.

11:15.515 --> 11:18.057
Look, there she is!

11:21.599 --> 11:24.432
Is not it good?

11:24.515 --> 11:32.099
Mary, no one gave me the catering industry ... Be careful you do not get blown.

11:32.182 --> 11:38.224
With celebrities and politicians have to take it slow and do not nag.

11:42.307 --> 11:46.432
Mary, unpack my bags?

11:46.515 --> 11:50.849
- How was the trip? - Amazing.

11:50.932 --> 11:56.307
I'll be in the gardens Olympics! I met an English lord

11:56.390 --> 12:01.598
- To sponsor my garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.

12:01.682 --> 12:04.848
Chelsea Flower Show!

12:07.598 --> 12:12.140
Have you lost weight? Or do you dress just better?

12:12.223 --> 12:17.765
You should do that. For a woman is all a trade.

12:17.848 --> 12:22.265
Youth and beauty to wealth and power.

12:22.390 --> 12:29.390
It is both historically and biologically. What do you want out of life, Mary?

12:31.223 --> 12:36.765
I can not live without clover, ferns, willows and grasses.

12:47.973 --> 12:52.515
Shah and I gazed at competitors in the Chelsea Flower Show.

12:52.598 --> 12:56.723
We thought about participating next year.

12:57.848 --> 13:05.182
I would show up on my dream of the wild in the prestigious competition.

13:09.473 --> 13:14.390
I'm on the way, baby. I'll be on the VIP section.

13:18.682 --> 13:23.265
- Sorry. - Baby, you came with beautiful weather!

14:11.556 --> 14:16.223
Poppycock. Pretentious people supporting monoculture.

14:16.306 --> 14:21.640
They do not care about the real nature and we destroy it.

14:23.556 --> 14:27.806
- What was your name again? - Mary. Mary Reynolds.

14:27.890 --> 14:33.515
- The flowering hawthorn girl? - Not directly. Why are you here?

14:33.598 --> 14:36.015
I am a botanist.

14:36.098 --> 14:39.223
I thought you were rock violinist, or something.

14:39.306 --> 14:43.890
- It is financing my growing addiction. - Like too wild flowers?

14:43.973 --> 14:47.348
- How lucky. - How?

14:47.431 --> 14:51.473
No, I mean ... I know all about wild flowers.

14:51.556 --> 14:57.973
- I design actually with wild flowers. - I'm not interested in design.

14:58.056 --> 15:02.515
Just what the flowers themselves can achieve.

15:02.598 --> 15:07.765
But it goes hand in hand, like a marriage.

15:07.848 --> 15:10.848
Oh okay.

15:12.098 --> 15:17.848
A marriage

15:20.681 --> 15:26.890
I have to talk about wild flowers for people who want chrysanthemums in their rebate.

15:26.973 --> 15:30.431
Good luck with your design.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.431
DUBLIN, IRELAND

16:24.889 --> 16:27.598
What brilliant ideas you have!

16:27.681 --> 16:34.598
Her new design for my garden paradise is incredible.

16:34.681 --> 16:38.764
- Really? And this? - My past. "Irish Heaven".

16:38.848 --> 16:44.014
Only a small window. This is my "Celtic sanctuary."

16:44.098 --> 16:51.306
Man against nature, nature against man. Interdependence, harmonious.

16:51.389 --> 16:54.931
- Ingenious! - Stop it...

16:55.098 --> 16:58.889
We need to show it to my agent.

17:04.598 --> 17:07.223
Sorry...

17:07.306 --> 17:12.388
- The front door? - Oh, to the left.

17:12.473 --> 17:16.556
- What's the matter? - Just great.

17:17.973 --> 17:19.848
Okay.

17:29.556 --> 17:33.848
Mary, something big is happening. I'm not going back to Dublin.

17:33.931 --> 17:38.556
Unfortunately, it's the end of the job, but it was a test.

17:38.639 --> 17:44.723
Do not forget to lock when you go and leave the keys in the mail slot. Bye!

17:47.889 --> 17:52.306
I have no job. She stole my green book.

17:52.389 --> 17:59.889
- All that mattered is gone. - You have ideas in your head and heart.

17:59.973 --> 18:05.973
You do not need your book anymore. Each new design is better than the last.

18:06.056 --> 18:08.723
Why she dumped me?

18:08.806 --> 18:14.181
There are a million people who just want to blow up.

18:14.264 --> 18:19.722
But there is only one Mary Reynolds. No one can do it you can.

18:19.806 --> 18:23.014
Never forget that.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.556
Chelsea Flower Show.

19:32.681 --> 19:36.847
Believe that it has happened, it has happened.

19:49.806 --> 19:52.514
"Tack"-

19:52.597 --> 19:57.514
- "For my gold medal in garden design" -

19:58.847 --> 20:01.681
- "vid Chelsea" -

20:02.847 --> 20:06.472
- "Flower Show."

20:20.889 --> 20:24.264
- Nigel Hogg, thank you. - Who's asking?

20:24.389 --> 20:28.889
Mary Reynolds from Ireland. I want to report me to the garden competition.

20:28.972 --> 20:30.680
A moment.

20:46.930 --> 20:50.930
- Nigel Hogg, Chelsea. - I would like to register for the competition.

20:51.014 --> 20:54.930
Are you a registered garden center?

20:55.014 --> 20:59.597
- I have designed many wild gardens. - You sound awful young.

20:59.680 --> 21:05.139
Chelsea is for experienced professionals. Farewell.

21:08.222 --> 21:12.472
Marigold, people start to get annoying!

21:12.555 --> 21:15.305
Do not connect them to me!

21:21.180 --> 21:26.930
Thanks for the gold medal in garden design at the Chelsea Flower Show.

21:32.389 --> 21:36.097
- Mr. Hogg, please. - He is not available.

21:36.180 --> 21:41.722
- I never got the application form. - Excuse me. Mold Allergy.

21:41.847 --> 21:47.222
So? I have the perfect herbs against it. From Wicklow.

21:47.305 --> 21:51.680
- Oh no, please ... - I know you're there! Pay!

21:51.805 --> 21:58.847
I am a businessman with spending! I need a new milking machine.

21:58.930 --> 22:02.680
I come here with a bailiff!

22:19.763 --> 22:24.013
Hey, Seán. A lemonade and switch to the phone.

22:24.097 --> 22:27.888
- Locally or internationally? - International.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.847
- Hello? - Marigold, how are you?

22:38.930 --> 22:42.847
The herbs you sent has changed my life.

22:42.972 --> 22:45.513
How can I thank you?

22:45.597 --> 22:51.597
- An application form for the competition. - They must be inside on Monday.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.263
The exhibition is all about for months.

22:56.680 --> 23:03.513
Applications must be very detailed. Shape, concept, sponsorships 250 000 pounds.

23:07.138 --> 23:10.888
The top, it should be okay.

23:10.972 --> 23:15.930
It would be our romantic weekend in the country.

23:16.013 --> 23:22.597
I'm faxing over form now. Fill it in and send it by courier as quickly as you can.

23:22.722 --> 23:27.013
- Hogg notice nothing. - Thanks so much!

23:28.138 --> 23:33.763
Jeez, it says that a sponsor will donate 250,000 pounds.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.263
- I'll find somebody. - In two days?

23:36.347 --> 23:42.430
Use my family's business in Beirut. Chelsea will probably not be able to reach them.

23:47.763 --> 23:54.305
Mary, put on something nice. You fly to London at two o'clock.

24:06.555 --> 24:09.972
Marigold? Mary Reynolds.

24:15.805 --> 24:18.680
I brought some more herbs.

24:18.763 --> 24:23.805
- Wonderful. - From the green hills of Ireland ...

24:39.971 --> 24:44.013
I hope that is not marijuana.

24:44.096 --> 24:45.846
On the cover.

24:47.346 --> 24:53.555
From my sister-in Cumbria. For my birthday.

24:53.638 --> 24:57.013
Please do not remind me.

25:07.930 --> 25:12.346
- Thanks so much. - We keep our fingers crossed.

25:15.513 --> 25:18.680
You are a breath of fresh air here.

25:30.763 --> 25:37.596
"Celtic sanctuary reminds us how important it is with wild nature."

25:41.055 --> 25:46.638
Månvalvet is a portal between the spiritual and natural world.

25:47.888 --> 25:54.971
The old trail of black oak leads us, as the pre-Roman days, to a bygone era.

25:58.430 --> 26:04.055
The Celts believed that the sun sank into the water and sucked up its healing power.

26:04.138 --> 26:10.555
Celtic granittroner imparts its energy to the person sitting on them.

26:12.180 --> 26:18.555
No one can step into the inner circle surrounded by vildblomster-

26:18.638 --> 26:22.054
-without to leave behind the ordinary.

26:22.138 --> 26:28.388
We enter a magical place where we are in harmony with the wild nature.

26:54.221 --> 26:59.304
You are admitted to the Chelsea Flower Show. Preparations begin for 80 days.

26:59.388 --> 27:05.179
Then you have three weeks to complete the garden. Congratulations.

27:17.263 --> 27:22.513
2000 candidates to eight platser- and you came up with!

27:22.596 --> 27:27.846
- The world's best garden show. - Cheers!

27:31.179 --> 27:38.179
Do you know how hard it is to get funding for a garden?

27:38.263 --> 27:42.929
A word now: money. You need lots.

27:43.013 --> 27:47.388
Your clients-where do you start.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.263
Want to try?

28:04.388 --> 28:06.679
It's not possible.

28:08.346 --> 28:11.679
- Hey, Madden! - Beware of the dogs!

28:17.638 --> 28:21.388
As you can see, the curves are important for the flow.

28:21.513 --> 28:25.721
I like it when it's straight. Do you?

28:25.804 --> 28:31.429
Yes, but I think that the curves will be ...

28:33.679 --> 28:38.304
- Attract more birds. - Do you like birds?

28:38.429 --> 28:42.012
Yes ... Have a nice evening.

28:45.096 --> 28:49.179
Your fees! You are not known as Shah.

28:49.262 --> 28:53.054
Can not you sprinkle tulips? What would it cost?

28:53.137 --> 28:56.179
I can pay with Botox.

29:02.887 --> 29:07.179
I have no sponsors. Not a single penny.

29:07.304 --> 29:13.929
- The other spends millions ... - You must have wild flowers. Nurseries?

29:14.012 --> 29:18.971
500 wild species! Nurseries are not wild plants.

29:19.054 --> 29:22.554
Hawthorn must be at least 200 years.

29:22.637 --> 29:27.721
And I need money for trucks and ferries from Ireland:

29:27.804 --> 29:34.137
- And the masons who can build the old peasant style. Who donates to someone like me?

29:34.221 --> 29:36.971
You need a starting point.

29:37.054 --> 29:39.846
Wait!

29:39.929 --> 29:42.429
I saw the masons!

29:49.012 --> 29:53.971
Your wall is beautiful. Where did you learn the old peasant style?

29:54.054 --> 29:56.679
We are old farmers.

29:56.762 --> 30:02.721
Something big has happened, and I want you to build this wall in London.

30:02.804 --> 30:07.262
My design has been admitted to the Chelsea Flower Show.

30:07.346 --> 30:12.221
- I need wild flowers and hawthorn. - We can do that.

30:12.346 --> 30:16.637
But we go nowhere without the man's consent.

30:16.721 --> 30:23.054
He is the man and we are the clan. He has N'Shuma.

30:23.137 --> 30:26.762
According to the wise rabbi Maimonides ...

30:28.304 --> 30:35.637
800 years ago in Egypt? N'Shuma is the soul's highest level.

30:36.429 --> 30:40.387
Few have it, and no one owns it.

30:40.470 --> 30:47.720
It is like a membership where people's documents entitling them to be with.

30:47.804 --> 30:53.637
- Where do I sign up? - It does not work that way.

30:53.720 --> 30:57.387
Okay, and where can I find the man?

30:57.470 --> 31:04.679
You will find the man and his Green Angels on Future Forests in West Cork.

31:04.762 --> 31:11.429
But do not hope for much. The only thing he loves is wild flowers.

31:11.512 --> 31:13.804
I feel the same.

32:14.387 --> 32:16.970
Oh my God...

32:19.679 --> 32:22.345
Mary? Mary?

32:26.679 --> 32:30.137
- Is everything okay? - Yes.

32:31.553 --> 32:33.845
What are you doing here?

32:33.928 --> 32:37.762
I need your help.

32:37.845 --> 32:42.970
Future Forests is the only one that has all the wild plants I need.

32:43.053 --> 32:50.012
You are the only one who can carry old Hawthorn. We both know how hard it is.

32:50.137 --> 32:52.970
What number.

32:53.095 --> 32:57.720
Did you come all this way just to say that?

32:57.803 --> 33:04.512
I'll compete in the Chelsea Flower Show. I need your help.

33:05.137 --> 33:10.595
We do not do shows or galas.

33:10.678 --> 33:18.262
I do not do it, anyway. Need Green Angels help you get to ask them.

33:18.387 --> 33:26.053
I'm late for a treatment session. Because you certainly are not dead ... I will go there.

33:30.012 --> 33:33.262
What is the first thing on the agenda?

33:33.345 --> 33:40.970
- My friends do not want to shit in the swamp. - Do they pollute the planet?

33:41.095 --> 33:44.053
Toilet or not?

33:45.428 --> 33:52.178
I Ching coins are Gaia-deterministic authorities. Let them decide.

33:55.428 --> 33:59.470
Mountains of wind.

33:59.553 --> 34:04.428
All collected at 8.00, the upper pasture.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.762
Next?

34:08.844 --> 34:11.344
We have some new here today.

34:11.469 --> 34:15.678
She wants to talk to us about the Chelsea Flower Show.

34:15.762 --> 34:20.844
Excuse. Hi, I'm Mary.

34:20.928 --> 34:28.387
You do not know me, but I have come to ask for help with my garden design.

34:28.469 --> 34:33.636
Gardens today has nothing to do with the feeling that wild nature gives us.

34:33.719 --> 34:39.719
People travel to see beautiful places, but their gardens is the exact opposite.

34:39.803 --> 34:43.803
They are groomed lawns full of insecticide.

34:43.886 --> 34:50.011
They should be covered with moss and clover that bees love.

34:50.094 --> 34:54.303
Our gardens often ignore nature's true spirit.

34:54.386 --> 35:00.595
Parks is as cosmetics, beautiful in the same way as a made up ansikte-

35:00.678 --> 35:04.761
- But they are not genuine. They lack the vitality and atmosphere.

35:04.845 --> 35:10.511
As the wild nature's magical places fewer remember from their childhood.

35:10.595 --> 35:13.553
How can we help you?

35:13.636 --> 35:20.136
My "Celtic sanctuary" to remind people about the importance of preserving the wild.

35:20.261 --> 35:25.095
What I really need is an entrepreneur who really understand it-

35:25.178 --> 35:29.470
- And can help me do wild gardens moderna-

35:29.595 --> 35:36.636
- So we can get the wild nature feeling in city parks, roof terraces and gardens.

35:36.720 --> 35:41.511
We can do it through my garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.

35:41.595 --> 35:46.553
Let's throw a lifeline to the wild nature.

35:53.386 --> 35:58.595
I support Mary's anti

35:58.678 --> 36:04.345
Mary might light the small light that shows us the way forward.

36:04.428 --> 36:07.720
It leads nowhere.

36:07.803 --> 36:13.511
This wild nature garden is forgotten after nine days.

36:13.595 --> 36:17.303
We must bring attention to change people.

36:17.386 --> 36:23.178
What we must do is focus on our water programs in Africa.

36:23.261 --> 36:26.345
Let the I Ching decide.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.761
The coins say yes.

36:33.886 --> 36:40.636
Our resources make more use of irrigation and reforestation in the desert.

36:48.594 --> 36:52.844
- Have you slept in a tree house before? - No.

36:58.553 --> 37:02.053
Give me your hand. Hold on.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.011
Climb up.

37:07.678 --> 37:10.469
- Okay? - Yes ...

37:19.219 --> 37:24.428
- You're lucky to get to stay here. - Regarding pre ...

37:24.511 --> 37:30.469
- Garden shows are not our thing. - But rock stars' gardens is it?

37:30.553 --> 37:34.844
I stand out with kändisdravlet because I have to.

37:34.928 --> 37:39.219
Rock stars pay, you know. Greatly.

37:40.469 --> 37:47.219
- So this is about money? - If the priorities. Availability.

37:47.303 --> 37:50.344
The stone walls are booked until September.

37:50.428 --> 37:55.844
- The intention behind the design matters. - Is your intention to become famous?

37:55.928 --> 38:01.011
- Why do you think that? - I know some people ...

38:06.386 --> 38:11.344
I'll show you the real wild nature in the morning.

38:11.428 --> 38:16.928
Nothing beats creating compost in their own garden.

38:17.803 --> 38:24.261
I hereby inaugurate the Future Forests Memory Toilet.

38:34.886 --> 38:37.594
Say Cheese".

38:46.302 --> 38:49.011
To you, lady.

38:59.219 --> 39:01.594
How did you get all wild plants?

39:01.719 --> 39:08.344
We follow the motorway construction, rescues ancient walls and replant wildflowers.

39:08.427 --> 39:14.011
We are even 200 years old hawthorn alive.

40:00.761 --> 40:03.386
It is so beautiful!

40:10.219 --> 40:16.136
What if everyone got to know of the wild. That's what my garden is about.

40:17.511 --> 40:24.052
My problem is that Chelsea is about to impress the rich and famous designers do.

40:24.136 --> 40:30.511
You are an ignorant shit boot! You know nothing about what good design can achieve!

40:30.677 --> 40:35.386
You swim in waterfalls all the time. Most will not ever do it.

40:35.469 --> 40:39.552
You're obviously very passionate.

40:39.677 --> 40:44.427
But you can not create a wild garden at Chelsea in three weeks.

40:44.510 --> 40:50.552
Well, with your help! It is a chance to change people's way of thinking!

40:50.677 --> 40:54.677
Not only with my garden, but with your oasis project too.

41:00.927 --> 41:05.010
The construction is Christy area-

41:05.094 --> 41:12.677
- But I can give you hawthorn, wild flowers, bluebells, ferns and walls.

41:12.760 --> 41:19.177
Then we have the equipment, freight, room and board. It is impossible to calculate the time.

41:19.260 --> 41:22.302
But it becomes much.

41:38.844 --> 41:43.302
Excuse. I came to say goodbye.

41:43.385 --> 41:45.844
Where are you going?

41:45.927 --> 41:51.260
I have to Lalibela in Ethiopia to meet with Kaori.

41:51.344 --> 41:55.135
- Who? - A Japanese writer.

41:55.219 --> 41:58.469
She is sponsoring my forest park there.

42:00.260 --> 42:04.135
You know I can not do without you, Chelsea.

42:04.219 --> 42:07.885
So ... come to Ethiopia.

42:09.677 --> 42:12.177
We may need a designer.

42:15.260 --> 42:19.135
Go and plant your garden of Eden in the desert!

42:19.219 --> 42:24.177
Begin in Egypt and end in Timbuktu, completely alone.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.344
Good luck.

42:27.844 --> 42:31.802
60 DAYS TO PREPARING

43:17.093 --> 43:21.927
To do that he will come back to me.

43:24.510 --> 43:28.135
To do that he will come and help me.

43:42.593 --> 43:49.260
Britain's Prince Charles are competing against you with his "Physics Garden".

43:49.343 --> 43:52.218
Tell us about your.

43:52.302 --> 43:56.468
I design atmospheres.

43:56.552 --> 44:02.843
I want to show that we can preserve the wild nature in our own gardens.

44:02.927 --> 44:10.052
- You're still sponsors? - Yes, and I admit-I'm desperate.

44:10.135 --> 44:14.927
- How much do you need? - 250,000 pounds.

44:15.010 --> 44:22.010
You have uniquely been accepted with your amazing wild garden-

44:22.093 --> 44:27.927
- To raise awareness, and can not get the money in Ireland?

44:28.010 --> 44:32.677
Someone must realize how important it is that your garden go to Chelsea.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.135
Otherwise, the nation should be ashamed.

44:41.052 --> 44:43.927
- Aired it live? - Yes.

44:45.010 --> 44:49.593
- Here. Take a glass of wine. - No thanks.

44:49.676 --> 44:54.093
You get hawthorn and wild flowers from Future Forests.

44:54.218 --> 44:59.885
- Well, you get up to speed now. - But all require Christy ahead.

45:01.551 --> 45:05.051
I have to convince him.

45:05.135 --> 45:08.885
I have to go to Ethiopia.

45:08.968 --> 45:14.426
You can not just go to Ethiopia! It's not like a day trip to Dingle.

45:14.510 --> 45:21.760
You can not go after a guy who does not understand you. Or does he?

45:21.843 --> 45:25.426
- Not yet. - Forget him.

45:25.510 --> 45:31.510
It will be a big void in your exhibit space.

45:31.593 --> 45:36.426
- You're embarrassing all of Ireland. - He knows the wild so that I do.

45:36.510 --> 45:42.010
The wildlife is there even without Christy feelings.

45:43.010 --> 45:49.426
- Mary ... you're in love! - Do not be ridiculous!

45:49.510 --> 45:52.801
If he knows how I see it, he understands me.

45:52.885 --> 45:58.093
It can happened. It happened to us. Amazing things happen.

45:58.176 --> 46:04.385
- Stay out of this, Imad. - You can not just go to Ethiopia.

46:04.468 --> 46:07.885
- You have to take injections! - I have done that.

46:07.968 --> 46:13.718
You took syringes because you knew I'd lend you money.

46:14.635 --> 46:17.635
It is not good for a woman to travel alone.

46:17.718 --> 46:22.010
- You have never left Ireland! - I have been at Chelsea.

46:22.093 --> 46:25.426
Christy knows that you will?

46:30.843 --> 46:34.843
40 DAYS TO PREPARING

46:47.593 --> 46:50.509
Miss, can I carry your bag?

46:50.593 --> 46:54.676
- Christy Collard? - I Christy.

46:58.509 --> 47:00.759
Tack!

47:36.676 --> 47:40.343
- Christy's house. - Thanks.

48:16.093 --> 48:19.634
Christy Collard, I suppose.

48:26.051 --> 48:28.134
Mary.

48:31.759 --> 48:35.384
I can not believe you're here.

48:39.218 --> 48:43.134
Welcome to the mythical Ethiopia.

48:44.259 --> 48:47.843
Come, I'll show you around.

48:51.884 --> 48:57.551
You have to see what Kaori sponsors here, so that you understand.

48:59.676 --> 49:03.342
We headed for the water from the river to the seedlings.

49:03.426 --> 49:07.384
They will then be planted on the hillside in order to bind the soil.

49:07.467 --> 49:13.301
The plants turn into trees. So we hold back desertification.

49:19.592 --> 49:25.634
It's a small start, but we can spread it all over Africa.

49:27.217 --> 49:33.676
The country was recaptured with plants. Animals graze here and fertilize the soil.

49:35.217 --> 49:39.967
All this was green before.

49:41.467 --> 49:46.509
The only way to make the desert bloom is to mimic nature.

49:46.592 --> 49:52.384
Forest Park is proof that we can reverse climate change.

49:52.467 --> 49:58.217
- It's a miracle, Christy. - The trees provide fuel, fodder, medicine, roof.

49:58.342 --> 50:04.842
They prevent the rain to wash away the soil. But it required millions of trees.

50:12.426 --> 50:17.551
We built the first park close to this water source.

50:19.592 --> 50:25.176
Desta walk for two hours to fetch water every day.

50:29.009 --> 50:31.592
Where do I sleep?

50:32.801 --> 50:34.801
Where.

50:36.259 --> 50:39.176
Where do you sleep?

50:59.467 --> 51:04.925
Now you know why this work is important.

51:07.259 --> 51:11.925
They are important, both. They feed each other.

51:12.050 --> 51:16.634
Without Chelsea neither know or care eachother.

51:16.717 --> 51:20.467
I do not know why you do not understand it.

51:52.509 --> 51:56.217
You will need this.

52:04.509 --> 52:06.759
Mary!

52:13.467 --> 52:17.342
These churches are carved from a single boulder.

52:17.425 --> 52:21.175
According to legend, was built in the days of byggarna-

52:21.259 --> 52:25.134
-and ended on the night of the angels.

52:57.175 --> 53:01.925
- You need atmosphere in the park trees. - Atmosphere?

53:02.008 --> 53:05.258
You need more than planting and a water source.

53:05.342 --> 53:10.883
- They are fighting for survival. - Forest Park is a source of life.

53:10.967 --> 53:17.133
But if people should care about it, it must be a place to celebrate. A community.

53:53.133 --> 53:57.383
You are a good man. Christy, good man.

53:57.467 --> 54:03.258
Everyone needs water. Forest Park, plants, builders ...

54:03.342 --> 54:08.967
Every drop of water is a vote for me as mayor of a period.

54:09.050 --> 54:14.008
She does not know if she was coming or going.

54:17.175 --> 54:22.175
She should let him know how she feels.

54:23.842 --> 54:27.133
- Good good. - What did he say?

54:27.217 --> 54:30.300
He said he likes your concept.

54:30.383 --> 54:33.967
Do you think she will give you many children?

54:35.175 --> 54:37.675
What did he say now?

54:37.758 --> 54:43.592
- That you should be proud of them. - Good good. Christy!

54:43.675 --> 54:45.467
Tack.

56:05.300 --> 56:09.466
- Why did you come here, Mary? - You know why I'm here.

56:09.550 --> 56:11.675
Chelsea?

56:18.133 --> 56:22.716
- There's probably another reason. - What then?

56:22.800 --> 56:29.425
That no woman can resist you? I'm not one of your girls, Christy.

56:42.758 --> 56:44.925
20 DAYS TO PREPARING

56:45.008 --> 56:47.966
Why did you use my design?

56:50.591 --> 56:54.716
When you said that people would treasure it, I believed in you.

56:54.800 --> 56:59.008
- Treasure it? - Obvious.

56:59.091 --> 57:04.841
No you do not. You would help me with Chelsea in this case.

57:04.924 --> 57:08.716
Chelsea is not my world.

57:11.799 --> 57:14.216
I'm sorry.

59:00.674 --> 59:03.549
Mary! How did it go?

59:05.966 --> 59:08.591
There, there. Come here.

59:16.132 --> 59:19.841
Be still. Still.

59:21.716 --> 59:26.924
- Why are you so nice to me? - Because I am.

01:04:07.632 --> 01:04:12.007
I want you to see Africa as it can be.

01:04:14.632 --> 01:04:17.382
As it once was.

01:04:35.882 --> 01:04:39.465
Is it going well?

01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:42.840
The cradle of mankind.

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:47.465
I wanted to show you this.

01:04:47.548 --> 01:04:53.590
We can stop the desert less than a war costs.

01:04:53.673 --> 01:04:58.715
I think you can do anything.

01:05:23.215 --> 01:05:26.131
The trees will come back!

01:05:41.548 --> 01:05:47.173
I must return. I need to make Chelsea.

01:05:50.506 --> 01:05:54.590
I came here and showed what I can.

01:05:54.673 --> 01:05:57.381
Now it's your turn.

01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:11.631
10 DAYS TO PREPARING

01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:20.090
- Eve? - You are back. I've missed you!

01:06:20.173 --> 01:06:22.465
How did it go with Christy?

01:06:22.548 --> 01:06:26.798
I'm back to build the sanctuary but I have no money ...

01:06:26.923 --> 01:06:31.506
- Have you and Christy ...? - Not directly.

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:36.965
It happened something in Ethiopia. I'm not afraid anymore.

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:41.256
Not for Christy. Not for anything.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:45.381
I just need that one ...

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.798
- Mary? - The sponsor.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.715
Are you still there?

01:06:51.798 --> 01:06:57.131
We were impressed by your radio interview with Barbara Murphy.

01:06:57.215 --> 01:07:04.256
We want to give you a donation to move your garden to Dublin hospis-

01:07:04.381 --> 01:07:09.756
- To the benefit of the terminally ill. Good luck.

01:07:17.548 --> 01:07:21.548
Hagtornens gods must be with you.

01:07:21.631 --> 01:07:25.214
We hawthorn and wild flowers.

01:07:25.298 --> 01:07:31.089
We have a sheep pasture we can not carry, but you need a builder.

01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:33.423
It's me, there.

01:07:36.756 --> 01:07:39.714
Come on. I have something to show you.

01:07:42.089 --> 01:07:46.881
I thought we could transport the sheep pasture on the baking sheets.

01:07:49.756 --> 01:07:55.256
- How did you know I would get the money? - I think you can do anything.

01:07:55.339 --> 01:08:01.256
But we have 500 wild species that we need to get to bloom at Chelsea for three weeks.

01:08:01.339 --> 01:08:08.048
- You probably do not realize how extensive it is. - Believe that it has happened, it has happened.

01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:17.839
Keep the faith!

01:08:25.423 --> 01:08:31.256
We brought a sheep pasture from West Cork to Chelsea. 500 species on the baking sheets.

01:08:31.339 --> 01:08:35.423
We had eight 200 year old hawthorn tree must bloom at the right time.

01:08:35.506 --> 01:08:38.339
40 tons of salvaged stone wall.

01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:42.423
We would build "Celtic sanctuary" of 21 days.

01:08:42.506 --> 01:08:47.839
We tried to recreate the wild nature in a whole new way.

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:51.048
We tried to do the impossible.

01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:53.173
We were completely crazy.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.339
Where the hell are we?

01:08:58.423 --> 01:09:04.256
My aunt Gildas pensionärsboende

01:09:20.214 --> 01:09:26.671
- Hello, I'm Eve. Nice to meet you. - Sharing of bed?

01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:39.006
I thought that I could sleep in here and avoid the mess in the living room.

01:09:40.256 --> 01:09:44.421
Sure, but you'll take the couch.

01:09:44.506 --> 01:09:48.421
You must focus on the refuge.

01:09:50.464 --> 01:09:53.214
Nothing else.

01:10:00.172 --> 01:10:02.089
Gently.

01:10:07.339 --> 01:10:11.672
How did this rabble into? Ponytail!

01:10:11.756 --> 01:10:15.672
It is embarrassing! They do not even carry the matching t-shirt.

01:10:15.756 --> 01:10:21.589
- It's only the beginning. - Sickening. Is there nothing we can do?

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.672
Your Royal Highness.

01:10:37.756 --> 01:10:40.964
It is Prince Charles Garden.

01:10:56.381 --> 01:11:00.172
Do you have reinforced it with steel?

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:05.631
The vault is built to stand for 2 000 years, as the Romans did.

01:11:05.714 --> 01:11:09.172
They did not have today's liability.

01:11:09.256 --> 01:11:13.256
The security procedures must be followed.

01:11:13.381 --> 01:11:18.464
We submitted a report. It did not need to be reinforced.

01:11:18.589 --> 01:11:22.506
You know then exactly how much the vault can bear?

01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:25.214
Not exactly, no.

01:11:25.297 --> 01:11:31.339
In that case, my "friend" ... Install it down or be disqualified.

01:11:34.047 --> 01:11:36.089
Sorry...

01:11:39.505 --> 01:11:45.839
Can we get down the wall to the evening and get into reinforcing steel in the morning?

01:11:45.922 --> 01:11:51.380
- No! - Can not we just wrap his skull?

01:11:56.547 --> 01:12:00.130
Mary, what görhon here?

01:12:03.005 --> 01:12:07.964
To hell with her. She can not do anything to me now.

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:14.005
10 DAYS TO THE JURY'S ASSESSMENT

01:12:14.714 --> 01:12:16.297
Oh my God, no!

01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:21.339
- They are dead! Everybody! - No, they're not dead.

01:12:21.422 --> 01:12:25.380
Do not die, please!

01:12:25.464 --> 01:12:27.797
I'll get a hose.

01:12:33.089 --> 01:12:34.964
Christy!

01:12:35.047 --> 01:12:41.005
My God, what perfect timing. This is my design.

01:12:44.005 --> 01:12:50.964
A rose bed. It is located in the middle and look up at the circular sky.

01:12:51.047 --> 01:12:54.505
I may need your help with planting drawing.

01:12:54.589 --> 01:13:00.172
- I'm really busy. Sorry. - What are you doing here anyway?

01:13:00.255 --> 01:13:06.047
- Will you talk a little about the wild flowers? - Yes, something like that.

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:11.339
Honey, I need only a few wild flowers to the slopes.

01:13:11.422 --> 01:13:17.089
My hubby would undoubtedly be able to build ten to oaser-

01:13:17.172 --> 01:13:21.755
-If you made me the only little service.

01:13:21.839 --> 01:13:25.255
Does that sound fair?

01:13:25.339 --> 01:13:28.213
Think about it.

01:13:51.338 --> 01:13:55.463
5 DAYS TO THE JURY'S ASSESSMENT

01:14:00.463 --> 01:14:02.922
Where the tree?

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:07.797
I've ordered the bells to the slopes around the dam.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.797
I just want the wild flowers from the sheep pasture.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.088
Somebody release roots?

01:14:15.172 --> 01:14:18.505
- Over there. It should slope outwards. - Inwards.

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:24.505
In the Chelsea show it from the outside. You must follow the basic rules of gardening!

01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:29.255
Dad! Let her do what she does best.

01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:34.172
This is a disaster! It will never go.

01:14:34.255 --> 01:14:38.297
Down with the tree and lean inwards.

01:14:43.463 --> 01:14:48.505
Poor hawthorn trees. They sing the last verse.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.005
Hey, they live! Come on!

01:15:10.463 --> 01:15:17.088
- Do you think Hawthorn survive? - I do not know, Mary.

01:15:17.172 --> 01:15:21.713
What if they bloom in time for the assessment.

01:15:21.797 --> 01:15:27.213
Then you pray to the gods hawthorn. Further, we can not do.

01:15:35.713 --> 01:15:40.463
- Hello, who is responsible here? - I. Mary Reynolds.

01:15:40.546 --> 01:15:44.963
- I'm really impressed. - Thank you, Prince.

01:15:45.046 --> 01:15:51.088
You feel the harmony with nature here. It surpasses my wildest imagination.

01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:54.130
The location should awaken the imagination.

01:15:54.213 --> 01:15:55.338
Tack.

01:15:55.421 --> 01:16:01.963
Exactly what I wanted. But I do not remember the wonderful arch in my design.

01:16:02.046 --> 01:16:06.505
- Your garden is located to the right. - Oops! I ask apologize.

01:16:06.588 --> 01:16:09.963
It is an honor that you thought it was you.

01:16:10.046 --> 01:16:13.421
May the best win garden.

01:16:13.546 --> 01:16:16.880
- Your Royal Highness. - Hogg.

01:16:24.421 --> 01:16:28.963
Shah says that you adopts oases in regions where there is drought, Mr. Collard.

01:16:29.046 --> 01:16:34.755
Yes, I have built a. We need thousands.

01:16:34.838 --> 01:16:39.005
You have impressed on my fästmö

01:16:39.088 --> 01:16:45.171
- And oases is exactly the kind of charity that my foundation supports.

01:16:45.255 --> 01:16:51.546
- What can you do to her rose garden? - Rose Bed!

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:57.588
- I need to see the design. - I have them here. A moment.

01:17:01.588 --> 01:17:05.338
The structure I've drawn is quite perfect.

01:17:05.463 --> 01:17:11.296
I just can not decide how I'm going to plant. Roses to bed. Wild.

01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:16.505
But it is cliché to have them on the slopes, right?

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:19.088
We need your help.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.671
I think that your design is -

01:17:28.755 --> 01:17:32.046
- Perfect.

01:18:21.046 --> 01:18:26.046
Do not forget to pour two caps chlorine to combat bacteria.

01:18:26.129 --> 01:18:28.171
Thanks, Stan.

01:18:40.879 --> 01:18:45.838
Flower, please. Show the world how beautiful you are.

01:19:00.296 --> 01:19:04.088
32 HOURS TO THE JURY'S ASSESSMENT

01:19:24.254 --> 01:19:28.421
To all who made the garden came to life.

01:19:28.504 --> 01:19:34.504
Young, old, Irish, British, jew, Arab and American ...

01:19:35.587 --> 01:19:38.337
Tack!

01:19:38.421 --> 01:19:41.796
Cheers for the weeds, of the wild!

01:19:51.129 --> 01:19:57.129
VISNINGSDAG FOR MEMBERS Royal Horticultural Society

01:20:03.421 --> 01:20:05.379
HEAT!

01:20:51.004 --> 01:20:54.837
I told you they would not disappoint me.

01:22:09.962 --> 01:22:13.920
It's just weeds! What should it be?

01:22:14.004 --> 01:22:18.295
- It's brilliant! - I remember that kind of places from my childhood.

01:22:18.379 --> 01:22:22.795
Here she is! Mary Reynolds!

01:22:22.879 --> 01:22:28.712
Will you sign this? To my daughter. She studies the art of gardening.

01:22:28.795 --> 01:22:35.295
I know that you will change the world. At least a little.

01:22:35.379 --> 01:22:38.379
- Thanks. - Well done, Mary!

01:22:45.504 --> 01:22:49.004
10 HOURS TO THE JURY'S ASSESSMENT

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.295
Mary.

01:23:08.337 --> 01:23:12.295
I am eternally grateful, Christy Collard.

01:23:17.795 --> 01:23:22.420
It is the fog. Turn it off!

01:23:22.545 --> 01:23:26.212
Now I'm certainly disqualified.

01:23:35.087 --> 01:23:39.337
What happens? How much disinfectant took you in?

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:44.795
- As you said-two bottles! - Two corks. Two small caps.

01:23:44.878 --> 01:23:50.837
- The jury is here at dawn. - We would not have won anyway.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:56.587
You got me home from Ethiopia. You can go home with this.

01:23:56.670 --> 01:24:03.587
We can pump out the water and dry the leaves competitors.

01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:06.837
Come again.

01:24:21.753 --> 01:24:27.545
You are now officially a participant in the competition.

01:24:59.045 --> 01:25:05.045
Green Angels waiting for you. I can take care of the garden.

01:25:05.128 --> 01:25:09.128
Do you know that I love you, Mary Reynolds?

01:25:09.212 --> 01:25:11.587
More than anything else.

01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:10.169
- Mary Reynolds? - Yes?

01:28:10.253 --> 01:28:14.003
Participants must be present when the jury believes.

01:28:14.086 --> 01:28:17.669
Yes, sorry, of course!

01:28:29.586 --> 01:28:35.669
"People travel all over the world to see unspoiled natural beauty" -

01:28:35.794 --> 01:28:42.044
- "But modern gardens takes no account of those sites simple beauty."

01:28:43.711 --> 01:28:50.253
"They are special places that we must protect and preserve" -

01:28:50.336 --> 01:28:56.586
- "Each in its own way, before they disappear forever."

01:29:31.044 --> 01:29:35.836
The jury is almost finished. Who will win this year's gold medals?

01:29:35.919 --> 01:29:40.461
I Dainah Murphy in Chelsea in London.

01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:54.836
Mary, Mary, Mary! We are late.

01:29:54.919 --> 01:29:59.711
- What time is it? - It does not help to tell it.

01:30:02.169 --> 01:30:06.294
A gold medal goes to Mary Reynolds.

01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:14.044
There she is!

01:30:33.544 --> 01:30:36.127
- Congratulations, Mary. - Thanks.

01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:39.336
Well done, Mary. This way.

01:30:43.752 --> 01:30:46.086
It's fine.

01:31:01.002 --> 01:31:07.669
Thanks for the gold medal in garden design at the Chelsea Flower Show.

01:31:35.627 --> 01:31:37.669
In sagoklänning.

01:31:37.752 --> 01:31:41.752
I started sewing when I applied it to Chelsea.

01:31:41.836 --> 01:31:44.252
- Excited? - No.

01:31:44.336 --> 01:31:47.377
Not? You liar.

01:31:53.252 --> 01:31:57.585
- Tickets? - We got no tickets.

01:31:57.669 --> 01:32:00.960
This is Mary Reynolds, the winner.

01:32:01.044 --> 01:32:06.085
- You are not on the list. Thats how it is. - Ridiculous.

01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:10.460
Never mind. Just go.

01:32:17.044 --> 01:32:20.585
You will always be my FAIRY QUEEN.

01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:25.419
In the beginning, they say that your ideas are crazy, but one day ...

01:32:28.044 --> 01:32:31.002
One day they will come to you.

01:32:41.002 --> 01:32:42.960
Go yours.

01:33:10.169 --> 01:33:15.710
If it gets the chance nature will always come back to us.

01:33:18.544 --> 01:33:24.669
We can protect what is left and restore the lost.

01:33:27.544 --> 01:33:33.585
What if you could change the world. At least a little.

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:40.210
I started as a seed.

01:33:41.544 --> 01:33:44.669
Mary Reynolds is the youngest woman-

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:47.669
- Which won the gold medal at the Chelsea Flower Show.

01:33:47.752 --> 01:33:54.085
After the gold 2002, Mary build a garden for biodiversity in Kew.

01:33:55.918 --> 01:34:01.585
Mary attracts attention to the protection of natural habitats through their work.

01:34:01.668 --> 01:34:06.877
She is considered one of history's ten leading garden designer.

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:12.668
Christy Collard still works with Future Forests in Ireland.

01:34:12.752 --> 01:34:19.418
He and Mary are close friends and work together to protect the wildlife.

01:34:20.543 --> 01:34:27.460
Futarostiftelsen founded by Kaori Niitsuma expand in Ethiopia yet

01:34:27.543 --> 01:34:32.793
