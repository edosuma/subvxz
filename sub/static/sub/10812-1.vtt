00:02.753 --> 00:04.220
- I own a pizzplac

00:04.288 --> 00:06.022
Both: Help me, nathan.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.724
- My name is nathan fielder,

00:08.792 --> 00:11.060
And I graduated from one
of canada's top business schools

00:11.128 --> 00:13.262
With rlly good grades.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.031
Now, I'm using my knowledge

00:15.098 --> 00:17.133
To help struggling
small business owners

00:17.200 --> 00:20.336
Make it
in this competitive world.

00:34.551 --> 00:36.519
This...

00:36.587 --> 00:38.554
Is <i>nathan for you.</i>

00:38.622 --> 00:41.691
Frozen yogurt is one of the most
popular treats in america,

00:41.758 --> 00:45.061
Enjoyed by everyone
li asian women...

00:45.128 --> 00:47.496
Or just a regular guy
in the neiborhood.

00:47.564 --> 00:50.333
- Well,
I'm just a regular guy...

00:50.400 --> 00:53.135
In the neighborhood here.

00:53.203 --> 00:55.037
- But thatopularity
doesn't mean much

00:55.105 --> 00:58.908
If your yogurt shopis emp.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.310
Nick bautista is the manager
of yogurt haven

01:01.378 --> 01:03.312
In eagle rock, california.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.848
And lately, 's been
in desperate need of customers.

01:05.916 --> 01:09.051
- It would be a plus
if we got more traffic going.

01:09.119 --> 01:11.120
- So I paid him a visit
with some advi

01:11.188 --> 01:12.822
On how to help his busines

01:12.889 --> 01:16.392
Firstly, did you see someone
in here with a beard yesterday?

01:21.898 --> 01:23.199
- I was actually not working
yeerday.

01:23.267 --> 01:24.267
It was my day off.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.835
- Th was me.

01:25.902 --> 01:27.236
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.106
I came to scope it out.
- Oh, sweet.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.074
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:32.142 --> 01:35.244
- My mission was to fill
yogurt haven with customers.

01:35.312 --> 01:39.181
My plan--a crazy new flavor
that will get people talking.

01:39.249 --> 01:41.717
That flavor is poo.

01:41.785 --> 01:43.819
- [snickering]

01:43.887 --> 01:45.921
Is that serious?
- Yeah.

01:45.989 --> 01:47.990
The media responds
to controversy.

01:48.058 --> 01:49.325
We know that.

01:49.393 --> 01:50.826
I feel like
a poo yogurt flavor

01:50.894 --> 01:53.429
Might be a news story.

01:53.497 --> 01:55.131
If people read the paper,

01:55.198 --> 01:58.000
It could bring like...

01:58.068 --> 02:00.970
Hundreds of thousands
of people in here maybor--

02:01.038 --> 02:02.538
- Just to try that flavor?

02:02.606 --> 02:05.041
- Ye

02:05.108 --> 02:06.175
- Of poo.

02:06.243 --> 02:07.677
- Yes.

02:07.744 --> 02:09.879
I really needed
to sell my idea  nick.

02:09.946 --> 02:13.416
So the first step was to
actually create the new flav.

02:13.483 --> 02:14.984
I found a company online

02:15.052 --> 02:17.820
That said they could custom-make
any flavor.

02:23.093 --> 02:25.828
- And afr a week of waiting,
the flavor waseady.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.230
So I went to the gold coast b
in commerce, california

02:28.298 --> 02:29.565
To pick it up.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.767
- This is, uh--
this is what you requested.

02:31.835 --> 02:34.837
We call it "artificial feces"
flavor emulsion.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.606
Is there a real-
- there's no actual--

02:37.674 --> 02:39.475
- It's completely edible.
- It--you could eat this.

02:39.543 --> 02:40.710
- Right.

02:40.777 --> 02:41.744
- But if you wanted
to dilute it--

02:41.812 --> 02:42.845
- Mix it into yogurt.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.680
- You could make yogurt.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.382
- I didn't wanna be
the first to try it,

02:46.450 --> 02:48.417
But I needed to know
if the taste was accurate.

02:48.485 --> 02:52.088
So I conducted a taste test
with some stngers.

02:52.155 --> 02:55.524
So I'd le everyone to try
the frozen yogurt

02:55.592 --> 02:58.427
In front of you.

02:59.863 --> 03:02.331
- Ugh.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.833
Yuck.
- What does it taste like?

03:03.900 --> 03:06.268
- It's not good.

03:06.336 --> 03:07.503
- Peppermint.

03:07.571 --> 03:08.938
- Peppermint?
- Kinda like licorice.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.876
- Mm. It's got
some other familiar...

03:13.944 --> 03:16.412
Flavors in there,
but I can't...

03:16.480 --> 03:18.581
- What does this
taste like to you?

03:18.648 --> 03:20.883
- Poo.
[giggling]

03:20.951 --> 03:22.618
I don't know.
- Really?

03:22.619 --> 03:23.986
- Yeah, it does actually,

03:24.054 --> 03:25.621
What I would think of, um--

03:25.689 --> 03:27.590
- What we you basing that on?

03:27.657 --> 03:30.793
- Um, clearly the look helps.
- Right.

03:30.861 --> 03:32.762
- The color.
Uh...

03:32.829 --> 03:34.296
Normal.
- 'cause I was just--

03:34.364 --> 03:35.965
It was amazing
how quick you got it.

03:36.032 --> 03:40.069
So I was like,
oh, maybe she's ied it.

03:40.137 --> 03:43.906
- No.
- 'cause it's based on real poo.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.908
- Never tried it.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.109
- I mean, it's okay.
You can say if you have.

03:47.177 --> 03:48.310
- I haven't.

03:48.378 --> 03:50.646
- It's not--I mean--
- no, I promise.

03:50.714 --> 03:51.847
- Genuinely,
it would help to know

03:51.915 --> 03:52.982
If you actually have
and it does.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.750
- .
No, I have not ever.

03:54.818 --> 03:55.851
- Even by accident
you're telling me?

03:55.919 --> 03:57.086
- Not by accident.
- It's okay.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.088
- No.
- It's totally fine if you have.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.423
- I have never tried it.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.724
- People do weird ings
all the time.

04:01.792 --> 04:02.992
- I promise you.

04:03.059 --> 04:04.293
- I was happy with the results.

04:04.361 --> 04:06.328
And with the flavor
in good shape,

04:06.396 --> 04:10.933
It was time to revisit nick
at yogurt haven.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.368
- Um--
- huh?

04:12.436 --> 04:14.203
- I'm just gonna throw this--
- yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:14.204 --> 04:15.404
So what do you wanna do?

04:15.472 --> 04:18.874
- Um...

04:18.942 --> 04:20.476
We can give it a shot,

04:20.544 --> 04:22.978
Bui mean, it's not something
I would have out here for...

04:23.046 --> 04:25.247
More than a day.

04:25.315 --> 04:27.716
- We settled on
2 1/2 months to start.

04:27.784 --> 04:29.185
And with nick's permission,

04:29.252 --> 04:31.821
We installed the new flavor.

04:31.822 --> 04:33.556
W I wanted to get
an article in the paper

04:33.623 --> 04:35.491
And that meant
hiring a publicist.

04:35.559 --> 04:38.027
And I got a eting
with one of l.A.'s best,

04:38.094 --> 04:39.628
Tyler barnett.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.364
- I think if you really
are considering implementing

04:42.432 --> 04:44.233
A [bleep]-flavored ice cream,

04:44.301 --> 04:46.635
You shld reconsider
the entire campaign.

04:49.573 --> 04:51.540
- So you disagree?

04:51.608 --> 04:53.075
- Yeah,
I think it's a poor idea.

04:53.143 --> 04:56.178
- If you heard that a frozen
yogurt shop in your neighborhood

04:56.246 --> 04:58.480
Had a poo flavor, you're saying
you wouldn't go to check it out?

04:58.548 --> 04:59.915
- No.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.083
There are better ways
to get attention.

05:01.151 --> 05:02.852
I can come up with fiv
off the top of my head.

05:02.919 --> 05:04.253
- Okay, I'd like to hear one.

05:04.321 --> 05:06.021
- Frozen-yogurt-eating
contest.

05:06.089 --> 05:07.356
Invite kids
from all around the block

05:07.424 --> 05:09.391
To come and have
a frozen-yogurt-eating contest.

05:09.459 --> 05:11.093
- Okay, I would not go to that.
Next one.

05:11.161 --> 05:12.595
- You know wt you could do.

05:12.662 --> 05:16.732
You could fill a bucket
full of [bleep] frozen yogurt

05:16.800 --> 05:19.635
And put it on your head and
then stand outside of the store

05:19.703 --> 05:21.003
With a sign that says

05:21.071 --> 05:23.038
"I don't know
how to market a busine"

05:23.106 --> 05:26.008
And see if people come.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.446
People could come with
little spoons and they could--

05:30.514 --> 05:32.081
- When I first came today,

05:32.148 --> 05:34.950
I had to go to the bathroom
and you lent me your keys.

05:35.018 --> 05:36.218
- I did.

05:36.286 --> 05:38.187
- I saw that
you drive a porsche.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.688
I do.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.057
- Um, don't they say
people that drive nice cars

05:42.125 --> 05:44.026
Maybe have small penises?

05:45.829 --> 05:47.129
- I think it's a known fact.

05:47.197 --> 05:50.766
- Well, I n assure you
that's not a known fact.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.134
- How can you assure me?

05:52.202 --> 05:53.302
- Do you--have you seen
a lot of penises?

05:53.370 --> 05:54.637
- Some.
- Some.

05:54.704 --> 05:56.605
Since you're a penis expert,
I'm asming.

05:56.673 --> 05:58.107
- I'm not a penis expert.
What are you talking about?

05:58.174 --> 05:59.441
- You just said
that you're a penis expert.

05:59.509 --> 06:01.243
- No, I said I've seen
a few penises.

06:01.311 --> 06:04.747
- I think I haven't seen enough
penises...Like you have to.

06:04.814 --> 06:06.048
- I don't understand
the amount--

06:06.116 --> 06:07.550
Seeing the amount of penises,

06:07.617 --> 06:10.553
How that would have to do
with you having a small penis?

06:10.620 --> 06:14.590
Unfortunately, tyler didn't
wanna take me on as a client.

06:14.658 --> 06:16.559
So I opted for
a more grassroots approach

06:16.626 --> 06:17.927
To get the word t.

06:17.928 --> 06:19.161
Yeah, mom?

06:19.229 --> 06:20.296
Shoot.
Sorry.

06:20.363 --> 06:22.064
Oh, my god.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.999
Sorry, please--oh.
- Oh, here.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.234
- No, it okay.
- Here.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.435
- No, sorry,
my hands are full.

06:26.503 --> 06:27.970
- Yeah, it's not a problem.

06:28.038 --> 06:30.940
- I was just telling my mom
there's this frozen yogurt shop

06:31.007 --> 06:33.108
That has this crazy flavor.
- Uh-huh.

06:33.176 --> 06:34.343
- It's like
a poo flavor yogurt.

06:34.411 --> 06:35.611
- [laughing]
- I was just telling her.

06:35.679 --> 06:36.946
So I was dropping
all my stuff.

06:37.013 --> 06:38.647
You should check it out.
See ya.

06:38.715 --> 06:40.683
My plan was working,

06:40.750 --> 06:41.884
And people were flocng
to the store

06:41.952 --> 06:44.787
To check out the new flavor.

06:55.098 --> 06:56.632
So what flavors did you get?

06:56.700 --> 06:59.468
- I got e vanilla,
the euro tart,

06:59.536 --> 07:01.570
And the poo flavor.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.840
- Oh, the poo.
Th was my least favorite.

07:04.908 --> 07:06.742
- It was a succe.

07:06.810 --> 07:09.979
And like I predicted,
the store s full.

07:10.046 --> 07:14.149
And in the worldf business,
that's all that matters.

07:14.217 --> 07:17.186
T just when I thought
my job was done,

07:17.253 --> 07:18.620
Thnext day
I paid nick a visit

07:18.688 --> 07:20.456
With an even better idea.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.994
I went for dinner last night
at a restaurant.

07:25.061 --> 07:26.962
And while I was eating,
I saw some--

07:27.030 --> 07:30.165
I think, like, rat poop
on the ground.

07:30.233 --> 07:33.469
And I was so disgusted
I couldn't finish my meal.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.270
So I was thinking,

07:35.338 --> 07:37.806
I'm not sure
if it's a good idea

07:37.874 --> 07:41.510
To have something poo-related
in a place that serves food.

07:41.578 --> 07:45.481
- That's what
I was trying to say...

07:45.548 --> 07:46.815
From the very beginning.
- Right.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.917
Anyways, I juswanted
toive you that advice.

07:48.985 --> 07:50.986
So...You're welcome,
and--

07:51.054 --> 07:53.889
- Thank you.
I me--

07:53.957 --> 07:55.758
- Take care.

07:55.825 --> 07:57.259
I mean, if--

07:57.327 --> 07:59.928
Yeah, if you wanna hang out
some time outside.

07:59.996 --> 08:02.464
- Uh--
- I don't know.

08:02.532 --> 08:04.033
It's fine.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.869
Don't have to.
- Yeah, okay.

08:10.106 --> 08:15.177
- ¶ I said the wrong thing
at therong time again ¶

08:15.245 --> 08:19.348
¶ but I never rlly meant ¶

08:25.547 --> 08:27.014
Everybody talks
about the importance

08:27.081 --> 08:29.082
Of a good college education.

08:29.150 --> 08:32.186
But over the years,
I've discovered that being smart

08:32.253 --> 08:34.988
Has very little to do
with success.

08:40.295 --> 08:42.629
Confidence.

08:42.697 --> 08:44.898
And if you don't believe m
I'll prove it.

08:44.966 --> 08:48.135
I arranged a job interview
at a reputable law firm.

08:48.203 --> 08:49.636
They allowed us to film
with our cameras,

08:49.704 --> 08:50.938
But what they don't know

08:51.005 --> 08:52.673
Is that every word I say
in the interview

08:52.740 --> 08:55.475
Will be decided
by a seven-year-old boy.

08:55.543 --> 08:58.412
This is amir,
and he loves the color orange.

08:58.479 --> 09:02.115
- My favorite color is orange
because--

09:02.183 --> 09:04.952
Because orange--
it could--

09:05.019 --> 09:07.421
- So by only saying
what ar tells me to say

09:07.422 --> 09:08.789
Through this hidden earpiece,

09:08.857 --> 09:11.258
Ostensibly ging me
the brain of a seven-year-old,

09:11.326 --> 09:14.628
Can I land this high-powered job
based on confidence alone?

09:14.696 --> 09:16.830
Well, you're abouto find out.

09:16.898 --> 09:19.867
- What we actually do here
is we file a lot of documents

09:19.934 --> 09:22.135
In the court, motions.

09:22.203 --> 09:24.571
Why would you wanna work
in a law firm?

09:24.639 --> 09:27.774
- Because it says
"no bad guys."

09:27.842 --> 09:30.210
- Because it says
there's no bad guys.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.914
- And so no bad gu
could come in that town.

09:33.982 --> 09:36.283
- So no bad guys
could come in that town.

09:39.554 --> 09:40.520
Um...

09:40.588 --> 09:42.389
- What's the next question

09:42.457 --> 09:43.724
- What's the next question?

09:43.791 --> 09:46.960
- Okay.

09:47.028 --> 09:50.564
What kind of experience
do you have in this field?

09:50.632 --> 09:53.400
- What that means.
- What that means.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.603
- Legal experience.

09:56.671 --> 09:58.405
- Could we just not do
this question?

09:58.473 --> 10:00.474
- N we not do
that question?

10:00.541 --> 10:02.809
- Okay.

10:02.877 --> 10:06.913
Do you know how toile
documents in the courts?

10:06.981 --> 10:09.950
- Do you like skateboarding?
-  You like skateboarding?

10:12.820 --> 10:15.756
- No, I don't
like skateboarding,

10:15.823 --> 10:17.457
But I asked you a questi.

10:17.525 --> 10:18.759
- Can we mon?

10:18.826 --> 10:21.728
- Can we move on?

10:21.796 --> 10:24.097
- Okay.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.732
- It seemed like I was nailingt.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.801
And at the end,
I asked ms. Castanita

10:27.869 --> 10:29.136
R an evaluation.

10:29.203 --> 10:31.004
All right, so I know
that was a mock intervw.

10:31.072 --> 10:32.639
But if that was a real job,

10:32.707 --> 10:35.309
Would you have hired m
based on what you saw?

10:35.376 --> 10:37.177
- No.
- But maybe?

10:37.245 --> 10:38.745
- No.

10:38.813 --> 10:40.480
- But maybe though, right?

10:40.548 --> 10:43.183
- Maybe.

10:43.251 --> 10:44.785
- Wow. I just landed a j
at a law firm

10:44.852 --> 10:46.253
Using the words
of a seven-year-old

10:46.321 --> 10:48.055
By acting confident.

10:48.122 --> 10:49.923
But wh if,
instead of an innocent kid

10:49.991 --> 10:53.327
It was a jerk who was
actually trying to sabotage me?

10:53.394 --> 10:55.929
So I headed into
another job interview,

10:55.997 --> 10:57.597
This time
at dilbeck real estate

10:57.665 --> 10:59.766
With top agent
west de young.

10:59.834 --> 11:01.902
My friend john
has been instructed

11:01.969 --> 11:04.371
To make it as hard as possible
for me to get the job.

11:04.439 --> 11:06.606
So will my confidence
be enough to overcome that?

11:06.674 --> 11:08.175
- Hi, I'm nathan.

11:08.242 --> 11:09.910
- Hi, I'm nathan.
- West de young.

11:09.978 --> 11:11.278

11:18.619 --> 11:19.953
- Well, you can call me nathan,

11:20.021 --> 11:22.956
Or y canall me

11:23.024 --> 11:26.193
- [laughing]

11:27.395 --> 11:28.996
So--

11:29.063 --> 11:30.764

11:30.832 --> 11:32.566

like iike my women--easy

11:36.304 --> 11:38.405
- I like my jobs
like I like my women.

11:38.473 --> 11:41.708
- And how is that?
- Easy.

11:41.776 --> 11:42.943
- I like your dimples.

11:43.011 --> 11:45.512
- But again,
so what's your vision?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.881
- I like your dimples.
- Thank you.

11:47.949 --> 11:49.416
So does my mother.
- Is she still alive?

11:49.484 --> 11:51.685
- Is she still ave?
- Yes, she is.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.720
- That's too bad.
- That's too bad.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.693
- I mean my mother.
- My mother.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.695
- She's dead.
- My mother, she's dead.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.864
- And how did she pass away?

12:03.931 --> 12:05.832
- In the war.
- In the war.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.235
- In which war?

12:08.302 --> 12:10.103
- The iraq war.
- Iraq.

12:10.171 --> 12:12.839
- Okay.

12:12.907 --> 12:14.841
So what branch of the serve
did she serve in?

12:14.909 --> 12:19.446
- She fought for the iraqi army
under saddam hussein.

12:19.514 --> 12:22.382
- She fought for...Iraq.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.484
- Against america.

12:24.552 --> 12:25.952
- Against america.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.821
- Okay.

12:27.889 --> 12:29.823
- Yeah, so let me tell you
a little bit more about me.

12:29.891 --> 12:31.525
- So, yes, let me tell you

12:31.592 --> 12:33.960
A little bit morabout me.

12:34.028 --> 12:35.162
- Okay.

12:35.229 --> 12:37.798
- Along with my interests
in rl estate,

12:37.865 --> 12:42.035
I also am a child molester.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.308
Did you hear me?

12:48.376 --> 12:50.644
I saidi am also interested
in molesting children."

12:50.645 --> 12:52.145
- Um--

12:52.213 --> 12:54.981
- What I have is an infltion
that I can't control.

12:55.049 --> 12:56.616
- No, I'm not saying that.

12:56.684 --> 12:58.885
I said 98% of what john said.

12:58.953 --> 13:00.253
But the real accomplishment

13:00.321 --> 13:01.788
Was that
after the interview end--

13:01.856 --> 13:05.225
So wve done a job inrview.
- Sort of.

13:05.293 --> 13:07.761
- West was still impressed
by my confidence

13:07.829 --> 13:13.600
- Your confidence gave me...

13:13.668 --> 13:17.671
A reon to think that it would
be worth chatting with you more.

13:17.738 --> 13:19.072
- I was two for two.

13:19.140 --> 13:20.574
But what you just saw
is nothi

13:20.641 --> 13:22.409
Compared to what's
cong up later.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.106
- In the world of pizza,
delivery is king.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.707
But don't just take
my word for it.

13:28.775 --> 13:32.945
Tony a. Owns valley pizza land
in van nuys, california,

13:33.013 --> 13:35.047
And he says that over 30%
of his business

13:35.115 --> 13:37.950
Comes from delivery.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.655
- As usual, I went by
the day before in my beard

13:42.722 --> 13:44.256
To scope things out.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.859
The next day, I met upith tony
without my beard.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.694
- This is valley
valley's pizza lan

13:48.762 --> 13:49.962
- Ght.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.096
- So we got hollywood
zza land,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.198
We got l.A. Pizza land.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.668
- It should be--
there should be a "y" up here.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.603
- Yeah, yeah.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.772
- Tony explained to me
that the k to his business

13:59.839 --> 14:02.574
Was his 35-minute
delivery guarantee.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.310
But I had an even better idea

14:04.377 --> 14:06.378
That would blow his competition
out of the water.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.449
You're gonna guarantee
8-minute delivery

14:10.517 --> 14:12.351
Or you get a free pizza.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.557
- Yeah?
No, I don't think so.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.892
- 'cause why?

14:19.959 --> 14:21.060
You can't deliver
in eight minutes, right?

14:21.127 --> 14:22.594
- Of course not.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.631
Even I can't cook the pizza
for eight minutes.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.699
- That's the pnt.
- Yes.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.701
- You'll always be late.

14:28.768 --> 14:33.205
T the free pizza they get
will be an inch big.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.473
- Oh, okay.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.443
- The plan--
8-minute delivery guartee.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.844
With this offer,

14:38.912 --> 14:41.113
Tony will still get the money
from the orinal order,

14:41.181 --> 14:44.216
And he'll only have to give away
a ny pizza as the free one.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.685
Dot be shy to tell me
it's a great idea.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.421
To be nest,
I love compliments.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.256
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.794
- I had some flyers done up
to advertise the new promotion.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.496
- Ooh, very nice.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.264
- "8 minute delivery
guaranteed."

14:59.332 --> 15:00.499
So you're willing
to give it a try?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.334
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we gonna t it. Yes.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.469
- Okay.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.903
And with tony's approval,

15:04.971 --> 15:06.739
We printed off
hundredsf them

15:06.806 --> 15:08.507
And had them delivered
to houses anapartments

15:08.575 --> 15:09.908
All over the city.
[phone ringing]

15:09.976 --> 15:12.311
Pretty soon, the calls
were starting to come in,

15:12.379 --> 15:16.181
And the staff was hard at work
putting my idea to the test.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.550
But because this was going to be
a brand-new situation

15:18.618 --> 15:20.085
For the delivery guy,

15:20.153 --> 15:22.421
I wanted to prepare him for what
might happen at the front door.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.556
- Angel.
- Angel? Your name?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.291
- Yes.
- Why u have that name?

15:26.359 --> 15:29.261
- Um, because my mother
gave it to me.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.629
- Oh, okay.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.830
So when you arrive
at the fnt door,

15:31.898 --> 15:33.298
You're gonna be late.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.101
And people are gonna be wanting
their free pizza.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.270
So maybe let's just role play
what that might look like

15:38.338 --> 15:39.304
So you know what to expect.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.572
- Okay.
- Okay?

15:40.640 --> 15:41.940
- Yes.

15:42.008 --> 15:45.077
You would knock.
- Oh.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.512
- Oh, hello.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.914
- Hi, I have a delivery
fo-from pizza land.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.282
- Oh, yes, thank you.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.751
Your--but your ad said
ight minutes or a free pizza."

15:52.819 --> 15:56.155
And you were over 30 minutes.

15:56.222 --> 15:59.491
- Here's your free pizza, sir.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.926
- Hmm.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.262
This is a lot smaller
than what I expect.

16:03.329 --> 16:04.830
But technically,

16:04.898 --> 16:06.865
You didn'tpecify the size
of the free pizza.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.668
So this is fair.
Thank u very much.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.304
So that's probably
how it will go.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.273
And you still need to
charge them for the big pia.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.674
- Yeah.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.543
- With adequate training
and a backlog of orders,

16:20.680 --> 16:25.084
What are your--what is
your, ke, ultimate goal?

16:25.085 --> 16:27.086
- To be an artist,
a singer.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.387
- Singer?
- Yeah.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.356
¶ and theome ¶

16:31.424 --> 16:38.030
¶ of the ave ¶

16:38.098 --> 16:39.832
Yeah, I kinda tweaked it
a little bit,

16:39.899 --> 16:41.667
Made it my own.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.103
- Yeah, that's...Great.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.072
- Hi, my name is angel.

16:47.140 --> 16:51.443
Uh, I got an order of a large
cheese and pepperoni pizza.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.779
- Yeah.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.481
- Here.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.050
- Your free pizza.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.084
- No, sir.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.589
Are you kidding me?

17:03.656 --> 17:04.790
This is the free pizza?

17:04.858 --> 17:07.126
[laughing]

17:07.193 --> 17:09.061
- "guaranteed free pizza."

17:09.129 --> 17:13.065
- It doesn't specifically say
what size of pizza it is.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.299
Doesn't anybody
say anything to you?

17:14.367 --> 17:18.370
That's, like, diculous.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.273
- That's okay.
Have a good day.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.941
- Along with the $14.26.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.877
- Take your $14.26
and tell your boss

17:24.944 --> 17:26.178
To [bleep] 'fess up
and do the right thing.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.546
'cause that's not right.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.914
That's a piece of--
that's garbage.

17:28.982 --> 17:30.415
I want nothing from you.
Thanks, man.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.417
Be good.
Hey...

17:32.485 --> 17:36.989
Be careful driving.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.660
- All right.
Thanks.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.996
He didn't accept the pizza.
- He didn't take it?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.464
- At all.
- Did he pay?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.866
- No. He wouldn't take it,
he wouldt pay for it.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.101
He wouldn't--
he doesn't wanna see me.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.370
- Here, gimme your shirt.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.239
Gimme your shirt.
I'm gonna go in.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.344
"8 minute delivery guaranteed
or a free pizza."

17:59.412 --> 18:01.380
Itoesn't say
the size of thpizza.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.714
- You know what?

18:02.715 --> 18:04.850
Take your self and youpizza--
- we're following--

18:04.918 --> 18:06.318
- You're--and I'm following
my rules.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.420
[bleep] you!
That's my rules.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.821
I ain't paying [eep].

18:09.889 --> 18:11.323
Ta your pizza
and stick it up your ass.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.658
I don't wanna see it,
I don't wanna hear about it.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.126
- You don't have to be rude.
- Go away.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.827
- Why do you have nail polish
on your thumb?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.262
- 'cause I'm gay.
You got a problem with that?

18:17.330 --> 18:18.730
Bite it.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.065
- So how did it go?

18:20.133 --> 18:23.769
- He wouldn't pay.
What should we do?

18:31.211 --> 18:34.413
- When they have
a great guy,

18:34.480 --> 18:37.716
I don't know why
they don't just stay with him.

18:37.784 --> 18:43.055
Basically, they want the guys
who treat them horrible.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.891
- Nice guys like us
are left behind.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.361
- Yeah.
They say nice guys finish st.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.599
- At least we got our pizza.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.535
- Yes, I do love pizza.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.500
- Two weeks after implementing
the delivery guarantee,

19:03.568 --> 19:05.335
I nt back
to valley pizza land

19:05.403 --> 19:06.737
To see how things were going.

19:06.804 --> 19:08.472
- So eight minutes
is not enough for us.

19:08.539 --> 19:12.309
The pizza is not ready,
and we're late,

19:12.377 --> 19:15.145
And we give out thtiny pizza
for our customers.

19:15.213 --> 19:17.447

- Okay.

19:17.515 --> 19:20.617

19:31.062 --> 19:33.130
So far tonight,
you've seen me land jobs

19:33.197 --> 19:35.599
Using the words
of amir and john.

19:35.666 --> 19:37.567
But what if I did
my confidence experiment

19:37.635 --> 19:40.637
With someone who had no chance
of ever getting hired?

19:40.705 --> 19:43.373
Like ted.
He's a turtle.

19:43.441 --> 19:45.242
Again,
only usi ted's words,

19:45.309 --> 19:47.377
Can I impress executive
ash hamid enough

19:47.445 --> 19:50.113
With my confidence
to hire me at his company?

19:50.181 --> 19:53.216
- Hi. Ash.

19:53.284 --> 19:56.586
What's your name?

19:56.654 --> 19:59.456
I'm ash hamid.
Nice to meetou.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.801
Um, do you need someone
with sign language?

20:18.609 --> 20:20.677
Well, I always work
for myself.

20:20.745 --> 20:23.480
- Once he started talking,
I knew I was in control.

20:23.548 --> 20:25.015
And afterwards,

20:25.082 --> 20:26.283
I showed him who he'd really
been interviewing.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.586
This is who you just hired.

20:29.654 --> 20:31.988
And that's the power
of confidence.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.064
- I would love to be included
in your will.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.870
Double "d" breasts
are essential for you?
