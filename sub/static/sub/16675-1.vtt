01:38.640 --> 01:42.235
Hey, there's more over here!
Bring another team.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.154
Another team over
here by the tail.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.607
We're gonna need
a lot more help.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.319
Are you okay?
Is the baby all right?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.491
It's okay.
You can stay with your dad.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.664
I'm not his father.
He was traveling alone.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.163
- Go. You'll be okay.
- I wanna be with you.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.290
- Please. Please.
- Take him.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.087
I've gotta find the mother.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.211
- Now, go.
- Come on.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.127
Come with me.
You're gonna be all right. Come on.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.717
Everyone, please,
please stay where you are.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.514
We'll be with you in a minute.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.792
Hey, get them out of there.
It's gonna blow!

02:38.992 --> 02:40.369
Get them out!

02:40.577 --> 02:41.703
No! My boy!

02:44.831 --> 02:47.254
My boy! My little boy's in there!

02:56.718 --> 03:00.018
My baby's in there! I gotta get my boy!

03:01.765 --> 03:04.063
My baby's in there!

03:08.230 --> 03:10.073
My baby...

03:17.155 --> 03:20.455
NO! No!

03:47.561 --> 03:49.814
Mommy!

04:07.998 --> 04:09.375
You okay?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.631
I'm gonna need
some backup here. Move it.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.257
Were you in the crash?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.427
No. I found this baby.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.729
- I've gotta find the mother.
- Okay.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.024
There's a woman right over there.
She's looking for her baby.

04:29.811 --> 04:30.812
Yeah.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.028
Right there.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.530
Is this your baby?

04:43.575 --> 04:46.078
My sweet angel.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.051
I wanna go to the nearest hotel.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.223
You've gotta be kidding.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.828
You're not dead.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.031
<i>An Intercity
Air spokesperson indicates...</i>

08:06.236 --> 08:07.488
<i>...an estimated 200 passengers--</i>

08:07.696 --> 08:09.039
<i>Sixty Bakersfield.</i>

08:09.239 --> 08:11.742
<i>Wire reports confirm a crash
of an Intercity Air jet...</i>

08:11.950 --> 08:15.170
<i>...in the northeast section of the county
at Route 7 and Lake. Eyewitnesses--</i>

09:31.404 --> 09:33.372
<i>Everybody was terrified.</i>

09:34.783 --> 09:37.787
<i>Although, remarkably enough,
people maintained themselves pretty well.</i>

09:37.994 --> 09:40.338
<i>I think people pull together
in a situation like that...</i>

09:40.538 --> 09:42.415
<i>...and the crew was very professional...</i>

09:51.674 --> 09:53.392
Max.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.640
Max Klein.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.097
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Ha, ha.

09:57.305 --> 10:01.105
- Just passing through.
- You bastard, you don't look any different.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.357
- Ha, ha. Nice try.
- It's true. Look at you.

10:03.561 --> 10:07.691
I can't believe it, Max.
It's been 20 years.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.993
These are strawberry pancakes?

10:15.406 --> 10:16.407
Yep.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.376
I wanted...

10:18.868 --> 10:22.213
- Do you have whole strawberries?
- I guess.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.541
Bring me a bowl, please.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.553
I don't remember you having
a thing for strawberries.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.597
How's Bill? Is he head
of the Theater Department yet?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.051
No, he was passed over.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.476
Look, I'll make this quick.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.975
I can't stand going through the list
item by item.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.398
- My life's a disaster.
- No, it isn't.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.942
- Yes, it is.
- Trust me.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.191
Your life isn't a disaster.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.580
I'm fat. I haven't
written a play in years.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.916
Timmy, my oldest,
has a learning disability.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.297
I've learned to love
him for what he is...

11:08.501 --> 11:10.424
...not my fantasy of what he should be.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.303
The middle two, James and Sarah,
resent the extra attention Timmy got...

11:14.507 --> 11:16.430
...so they fuck up in school
to punish us.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.853
They're working that out
in their support group...

11:19.053 --> 11:20.930
...for siblings of the
learning disabled.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.062
And my youngest,
my beautiful baby, Ellen...

11:23.266 --> 11:25.189
...who was gonna be
this great ballerina...

11:25.393 --> 11:28.738
...destroyed her ankle playing
basketball with her brothers.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.613
As for Bill, he's screwing a student.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.874
It's pathetic. It's not even tragic.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.460
- Have a strawberry.
- What good will that do?

11:43.119 --> 11:46.248
Forbidden fruit always does good. Hmm?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.723
Forbidden fruit.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.769
Heh, I didn't come for that.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.103
Figures.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.986
- You always were faithful.
- And you?

12:12.190 --> 12:14.943
Heh. Who'd have me?

12:15.526 --> 12:17.119
Wait a minute.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.414
Aren't you allergic to strawberries?

12:19.614 --> 12:22.458
You almost died when you were little
from eating a strawberry.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.377
I'm past all that.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.547
Hmm? See? No reaction.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.676
No reaction at all.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.656
- That's him.
- Yeah, what?

12:57.860 --> 13:00.659
Good morning, sir.
I'm Agent Parsons, this is Agent Smith.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.036
We're with the FBI.

13:03.241 --> 13:07.997
Uh, you're registered as Mr. Max Klein,
1147 Varennes in San Francisco.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.831
Is that correct?

13:10.248 --> 13:13.343
- You got me.
- Can we come in?

13:20.049 --> 13:22.677
Sir, were you on a flight
from San Francisco to Houston...

13:22.885 --> 13:24.762
- ...that made an emergency--?
- Yes, I was.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.474
Took a hike from the scene?
Just up and left?

13:27.932 --> 13:30.185
- What time is it?
- Ten o'clock Thursday morning.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.111
You've been missing almost a day.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.191
- Missing?
- Mr. Klein, what are you doing here?

13:35.732 --> 13:39.032
You walked from the crash,
rented a car, drove to L.A.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.870
Why?

13:41.571 --> 13:43.039
They didn't need me anymore.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.457
Need you for what?

13:47.618 --> 13:49.086
Am I under arrest?

13:50.121 --> 13:53.125
No. You haven't done anything.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.131
Do you, uh...?

13:58.921 --> 14:01.140
You know this man?

14:12.352 --> 14:16.027
Mr. Klein, I'm Cindy Dickens
of Intercity Air...

14:16.230 --> 14:18.824
...and I'm here to help get you home.

14:19.025 --> 14:22.575
That's nice. No one's taken me home
since the first grade.

14:22.779 --> 14:27.455
Heh. Uh, I have tickets on Amtrak
to get you to San Francisco.

14:27.658 --> 14:31.162
- And your train leaves in an hour.
- I wanna fly.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.044
I'm sorry?

14:34.207 --> 14:37.962
You'll fly me back
to San Francisco for free, right?

14:39.587 --> 14:41.510
Uh, of course.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.390
When I talked to your wife and told her
the good news on the phone...

14:46.594 --> 14:51.566
...she said that even, um,
before the unpleasant, uh...

14:53.267 --> 14:56.020
- Crash.
- Uh, yes, right.

14:56.229 --> 15:01.201
Even before, uh, that,
you were afraid to fly.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.539
I'd love to fly home on your airline,
but I've got a request.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.410
- Sir?
- I wanna go first class.

15:12.370 --> 15:16.170
Well, super. Ha, ha.
With our compliments, sir.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.761
- Cockpit preparation?
- Completed.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.263
- Light test?
- Check.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.310
- Oxygen and interphone?
- Checked.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.683
- Yaw damper?
- On.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.185
- Hydraulics?
- On.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.853
Uh, sir, may I see your boarding pass?

15:37.061 --> 15:40.031
Fine, your seat is right down the aisle.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.155
- Ah, good.
- Is he on board?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.206
Yes, he's sitting right over there.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.374
All right. I got it.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.589
I just made it.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.551
Hi. I'm Bill Perlman. Hi.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.262
Going home, right?
Glad to be going home, I bet.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.767
You're a shrink.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.478
That's right.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.020
I specialize in the treatment
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.608
Ha, ha. I wrote a book about it,
and several airlines hired me--

16:23.816 --> 16:25.659
We're just pulling away from the gate.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.114
- -As a consultant to work
with crash survivors.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.416
Naturally, one of my
perks is free tickets.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.369
Seat belt, I think you should put it on.

16:34.577 --> 16:39.549
I travel so much for work
that my idea of a vacation...

16:40.958 --> 16:44.212
That's normal. It's just to stay put.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.422
I'm not scared.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.635
But I would like another drink
when we're airborne.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.179
I should say, if we're airborne.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.457
- Mom, he's here. He's really here.
- You look fine.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.130
I knew you were all right.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.630
Max, Max. Oh.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.632
We were so worried. It's a miracle.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.599
You're alive.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.641
I knew I couldn't lose you.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.769
- Coffee?
- Let's get coffee.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.104
- Look at you. He's perfect.
- Yes, he is. He is. He's fine.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.816
Come in.

17:49.151 --> 17:53.622
- Were you scared?
- No. Not at all.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.669
- Excuse me. I'm Steven Brillstein.
- Nan asked if he could wait here.

17:57.868 --> 17:58.994
He's a lawyer.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.707
I'm sorry to intrude,
but Mrs. Gordon's frustrated.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.509
The airline can't seem to make
a definite identification.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.462
- Jeff's dead.
- Oh, my God.

18:07.670 --> 18:11.049
- Jesus, Max.
- Max isn't himself right now.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.473
- How do you know? We just met.
- I'm Bill Perlman.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.521
He's a therapist, works for the airline.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.808
I'm here for you, Max.

18:21.017 --> 18:24.146
If the airline pays your bills,
then it's a conflict of interest.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.823
I have an obligation to warn Mr. Klein
anything he says in your presence--

18:28.024 --> 18:29.571
Is in confidence. My agreement--

18:29.775 --> 18:31.948
Let's talk about that later.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.827
See, Nan doesn't know.
She thinks that if you're alive--

18:36.032 --> 18:37.079
No, I'll tell her.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.162
- Can we speak privately?
- This is inappropriate.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.507
All right, out. Get out!

18:44.707 --> 18:45.708
We should talk.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.711
- Max, relax.
- Dad!

18:49.295 --> 18:50.717
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.220
I didn't hit him very hard.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.224
I can't help you right now.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.765
If you need anything, call me, okay?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.101
- I think he's in shock.
- It's okay.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.982
Hell, we all are.

19:05.186 --> 19:08.406
In fairness to Mrs. Gordon,
I should hear the details.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.735
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine, thank you very much.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.419
- Do you mind if I speak bluntly?
- I'd prefer it.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.793
You saw Mr. Gordon's dead body.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.092
Let me give you a piece of advice.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.550
When you speak to your lawyer,
you should emphasize that you saw...

19:35.758 --> 19:40.309
...your partner's dead body,
and think hard about what else you saw.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.062
Doesn't matter
what you said to anybody so far.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.893
With accidents
there's a delayed reaction.

19:46.102 --> 19:49.481
Memories of what happened
return gradually.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.569
I know, I'm terrible to talk about it...

19:53.776 --> 19:55.904
...but it is important
that you remember...

19:56.112 --> 20:00.288
...if you saw Mr. Gordon
actually be killed.

20:01.659 --> 20:06.256
Another thing to remember,
if he wasn't killed instantly...

20:06.455 --> 20:07.957
...if he was in any pain--

20:08.165 --> 20:10.418
You telling me how to lie
so I can get more money?

20:13.504 --> 20:15.927
To be honest with you,
I wasn't thinking about you.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.850
I was thinking about Mrs. Gordon.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.052
She doesn't come from a rich family...

20:20.261 --> 20:22.138
...and now she's a widow
with two young children.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.223
- Aah!
- What? What? What?

20:26.934 --> 20:29.983
- What's wrong?
- I don't wanna tell any lies.

20:30.688 --> 20:34.613
All right. Next time just say no, heh.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.199
Evening, Mr. Klein.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.744
Don't scream, okay?

20:44.952 --> 20:49.253
Just bear in mind you're sitting pretty.
You get the partnership insurance.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.755
I think you owe Mrs. Gordon anything...

20:51.959 --> 20:55.179
...that could improve
her settlement with the airlines.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.065
One other thing. Ahem.

21:07.266 --> 21:11.772
Uh, I had all night
to go through Mr. Gordon's papers.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.653
He cashed in the tickets
that you ordered on Amex...

21:14.857 --> 21:19.704
...got a better price and rebought them
for cash and pocketed the difference.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.991
So Jeff cheated me out
of a couple hundred bucks.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.247
So he cheated his wife...

21:25.451 --> 21:28.955
...out of the automatic
American Express insurance.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.708
That's another reason why...

21:31.916 --> 21:36.422
...your memory of what happened
on the plane is so important.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.994
Nan-

22:01.779 --> 22:06.000
I knew it. I just knew it right away.
Oh, God.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.454
- We were stupid. We lived like jerks.
- No, no.

22:09.662 --> 22:13.292
Always just nagging. We wasted it.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.422
He loved you.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.093
Mom, keep the--

22:21.882 --> 22:23.976
Come on.
Let's go back in the other room.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.177
Why's she crying?

22:25.386 --> 22:28.811
You made him happy. He loved you.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.601
He loved you, Nan.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.440
Max, please shut up, okay?

23:00.671 --> 23:02.639
Let me hold you.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.845
Why didn't you call?

23:08.053 --> 23:11.148
- Where were you?
- I was visiting my past.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.067
But why didn't you tell me
you were alive?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.988
I thought I was dead.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.214
How does it feel to be a hero?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.257
Can we ask you a couple of questions?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.836
How did it feel
those last few seconds, Max?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.256
It's me.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.262
We live in the same city.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.565
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.231
This is my son, Jonah.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.857
Hi. I'm Byron.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.405
When did you know--?

23:59.605 --> 24:00.697
Dad, I wanna get on the bus.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.338
I'm Peter Hummel, Byron's father.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.670
I wanna thank you.

24:23.337 --> 24:27.433
- You have a brave son.
- I made my dad bring me.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.227
I can't sleep. I wanna be with you.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.479
Why do you wanna be with him?

24:32.680 --> 24:33.852
I feel safe with him.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.808
A lot of people are safe because of you.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.485
- They're calling you the Good Samaritan.
- I didn't save anyone.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.313
- The pilot saved us.
- You saved me.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.149
- Can you look this way?
- I was upside down, stuck.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.155
- He got me out.
- How did he do that?

24:45.359 --> 24:46.736
And a baby too.

24:46.944 --> 24:51.040
He found a way out for a lot of people.
We would've been fried.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.584
- What about the baby, Mr.--?
- Where did he go?

24:54.118 --> 24:55.870
Mr. Klein?

25:31.447 --> 25:33.996
Get out of the road, you asshole!

25:37.953 --> 25:39.125
Yes.

25:50.049 --> 25:54.225
You can't do it.
You wanna kill me, but you can't!

27:08.377 --> 27:10.675
<i>These images of death 
and destruction...</i>

27:10.879 --> 27:13.257
<i>...flashed around the nation
a few days ago...</i>

27:13.465 --> 27:16.469
<i>...when Intercity 202 
fell from the sky.</i>

27:16.677 --> 27:18.554
<i>The story is, by now, familiar.</i>

27:19.138 --> 27:21.482
<i>A complete hydraulic failure
on a routine flight...</i>

27:21.682 --> 27:23.776
<i>...from San Francisco to Houston.</i>

27:23.976 --> 27:26.820
<i>A desperate attempt
to reach Bakersfield Airport...</i>

27:27.020 --> 27:30.524
<i>...before the metal giant plowed
into the corn beside a quiet country road.</i>

27:31.984 --> 27:35.033
<i>Walking through this devastation,
one cannot help but reflect...</i>

27:35.237 --> 27:38.616
<i>...on what it means to us,
to those who lived...</i>

27:38.824 --> 27:41.247
<i>...to those who helped,
and to those who mourned.</i>

28:09.062 --> 28:11.656
Heh. You and that computer.
You spend more time playing...

28:11.857 --> 28:13.825
...than producing anything.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.404
- Relax. Will you just relax?
- I'm fine.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.699
You hear that?

28:21.783 --> 28:24.787
Max, this is a very important meeting.
I need you to calm down.

28:24.995 --> 28:27.043
I need you to be with me today.
All right?

28:27.247 --> 28:29.090
God, you're such a neurotic.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.923
All right.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.931
Something's not right.

28:58.654 --> 28:59.780
Oh, shit!

29:05.369 --> 29:07.667
<i>This is your captain.
Return to your seats...</i>

29:07.871 --> 29:09.999
<i>...put your tray tables up,
and fasten your seat belts.</i>

29:10.207 --> 29:13.051
Ladies and gentleman, please be
sure to fasten your seat belts...

29:13.252 --> 29:15.175
...tightly around your waist.

29:15.379 --> 29:19.259
The flight attendants will be coming
through to collect all your trays.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.770
- Is everything okay?
- Fine.

29:23.971 --> 29:26.599
We hit a little unexpected turbulence.

29:28.183 --> 29:31.062
<i>- This is your captain speaking.
- I don't think this is turbulence.</i>

29:31.270 --> 29:34.149
<i>We're experiencing problems
related to our hydraulic system.</i>

29:34.356 --> 29:36.734
The hydraulics. He can't steer.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.240
We're going down.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.154
Miss!

30:23.488 --> 30:25.741
- Miss, come here.
- I'm okay.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.078
Miss. Miss, come here.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.414
Come here. The fucking belt won't work.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.545
It won't get tight.
It keeps sliding down.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.628
Just hold him in your lap.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.464
That's what you're supposed to do
anyway.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.800
Just keep your belt on and hold him.

30:43.008 --> 30:47.104
- He'll be okay.
- He's slipping, he's slipping.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.480
He'll be okay.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.113
I love you.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.233
<i>I love you.</i>

31:01.360 --> 31:04.910
- Pass all the sharp objects.
- I need high-heeled shoes.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.286
Sir, you're gonna have to
take off your earring.

31:07.491 --> 31:10.165
Remove all sharp objects.

31:10.994 --> 31:13.463
Earrings. Sharp objects.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.802
Sir, your pin. You must remove your pin.

31:19.002 --> 31:22.632
You okay? It's gonna be fine.
Our captain...

31:22.839 --> 31:24.637
Shoes, please.

31:26.385 --> 31:30.481
Ma'am, you need to remove your glasses.
Take your glasses off.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.435
Ma'am, you must take your glasses
off your face and put them...

31:34.643 --> 31:37.772
It's very unsafe
for you to keep your glasses on.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.318
All sharp objects to the center, please.

32:00.502 --> 32:05.224
<i>This is it.
This is the moment of your death.</i>

32:16.143 --> 32:18.191
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

32:20.188 --> 32:22.407
<i>I have no fear.</i>

32:55.557 --> 32:57.605
You know what time it is?

32:58.059 --> 33:00.278
It's a fucking tomb in here.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.116
Get up.

33:09.446 --> 33:13.826
Get up, Carla. Carla, get up.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.253
The doctor brought someone.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.672
The Good Samaritan.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.999
Come on,
you read about him in the paper.

33:21.208 --> 33:25.258
Ay, Manny. Please, just let me die.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.135
Please.

33:29.382 --> 33:34.479
- That's a sin, Carla.
- I just wanna die.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.617
I appreciate you coming.

33:55.825 --> 33:59.955
She's in bad shape. I'm thinking
of putting her in the hospital.

34:00.830 --> 34:05.336
She's in a severe depression
about the crash, but she won't talk.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.388
She's very Catholic.
Old World, you know.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.257
Full of guilt and shame.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.636
I'm filled with guilt and shame.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.016
How is that Old World?

34:18.389 --> 34:20.141
You think I'm a fraud, don't you?

34:20.809 --> 34:23.733
Doctor, in the three months
since we flew together from L.A...

34:23.937 --> 34:26.156
...I haven't thought about you at all.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.112
She'll be right out.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.244
- Did you do this?
Mm-hm.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.542
- The carving?
- Yeah, the whole bit.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.790
I was playing, you know.

34:39.995 --> 34:43.248
- Beautiful work.
- Heh, thanks.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.427
- You're an architect, right?
- Yes.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.261
I better go get her.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.976
I think it's better if I see her alone.

35:00.056 --> 35:03.936
You know? One crash freak to another.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.649
Okay.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.243
Second door on the right.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.822
- Have a seat, doc.
- Thanks.

35:50.023 --> 35:52.025
- Hi.
- Hi, heh.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.197
He and your wife
are the only survivors I can't reach.

35:56.404 --> 35:59.908
She won't talk and he won't admit
the crash was bad.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.915
Is that right? He says it was good?

36:03.912 --> 36:06.665
Says it was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

36:22.889 --> 36:26.519
When I was 13,
my father died in front of my eyes.

36:26.726 --> 36:30.481
We were, um, going out of our apartment.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.740
I was throwing this, uh...

36:34.776 --> 36:37.245
This softball up and down.

36:39.114 --> 36:42.243
Mom screamed, I missed the ball,
turned to look.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.296
Dad was dead on the sidewalk.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.210
There was blood coming out of his nose.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.968
His legs were all twisted under him.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.220
He looked like somebody...

36:59.384 --> 37:01.728
Somebody with a big hand
just reached down...

37:01.928 --> 37:03.601
...and squeezed the life out of him.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.976
That was God.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.357
Yeah, that's what I thought.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.610
God killed my daddy.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.945
Why would he wanna kill him?

37:21.823 --> 37:23.825
Couldn't figure that out.

37:27.287 --> 37:31.588
He was a religious guy, hardworking...

37:31.791 --> 37:34.294
...kind to my mother and my sister.

37:35.545 --> 37:36.842
Did you love him?

37:39.924 --> 37:41.392
Yes.

37:43.762 --> 37:47.483
I didn't know why God killed my daddy.
There was no reason to.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.361
So...

37:52.771 --> 37:56.696
...I decided there was no God.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.587
You know...

38:10.955 --> 38:13.378
...I go to church every day.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.512
It's the only place I go.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.147
I go to pray for my baby's soul.

38:28.348 --> 38:30.567
You go there to talk to God.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.274
Gotta talk to somebody.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.575
Doctor, you know, the day we got home...

38:40.443 --> 38:42.912
...well, all these lawyers called
wanting our case.

38:43.905 --> 38:48.752
And one guy came to see me, and he said
he was the Good Samaritan's lawyer...

38:48.952 --> 38:50.954
...so I signed.

38:51.538 --> 38:54.883
I mean, I figured he'd
be the best, right?

38:56.459 --> 39:00.054
Because, you know, I need someone
who's gonna take it to them...

39:00.255 --> 39:01.256
- ...you know?
- Yeah.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.968
We're going to church.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.474
Huh?

39:12.433 --> 39:14.401
I think that will be okay.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.024
Let me.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.022
You know, he hurt me.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.609
He hurt me forever.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.955
But I still believe in him.

40:50.073 --> 40:51.825
Hmm.

40:52.033 --> 40:57.585
Well, people don't so much believe in God
as they choose not to believe in nothing.

41:02.043 --> 41:05.092
Life and death,
they happen for no reason.

41:05.338 --> 41:09.059
We may think that people are born because
their mothers wanted them a lot...

41:09.300 --> 41:12.600
...or because God needed
another home-run hitter for the Giants.

41:13.304 --> 41:19.186
We think that we die
because we eat red meat or rob banks.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.531
That way, even though
we can never be good enough...

41:23.731 --> 41:26.530
...or careful enough to live forever,
at least we can try.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.533
But if it makes no sense, if it...

41:31.239 --> 41:35.085
If life and death just happen,
then there's no reason to do anything.

41:37.286 --> 41:40.415
- There's no reason to love.
- What?

41:43.668 --> 41:45.386
There's no reason to love.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.854
My car's across the street.
Let's go for a drive.

41:59.058 --> 42:02.608
No, no, I can't.
The doctor told me I can't go nowhere.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.197
You'll be safe.

42:04.439 --> 42:08.694
Do you read the papers?
Everybody with me lives.

42:10.820 --> 42:13.039
You must think that I'm very stupid.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.704
No. I'm not lying.

42:15.950 --> 42:20.706
I can't explain it, but
you're safe with me.

42:21.831 --> 42:25.210
So, what are you telling me?
That there's no God but there's you?

42:28.921 --> 42:30.764
Come with me.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.344
Carla, I promise, you'll be safe.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.859
- This is a German car?
- Swedish.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.863
- It's very sturdy?
- It's a very safe car.

42:53.446 --> 42:57.496
Very safe and I'm an excellent driver.
Never been in an accident.

42:58.034 --> 43:00.662
Not while I've been behind the wheel,
anyway.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.919
- And you know what?
- What?

43:04.123 --> 43:06.672
It doesn't mean
we're gonna survive this ride.

43:06.876 --> 43:09.095
Because even if I do everything right...

43:09.337 --> 43:11.806
...even strapped
into this marvelous technology...

43:12.048 --> 43:15.268
...of the reinforced doors and roof,
we could still be crushed.

43:15.510 --> 43:20.732
- That's reverse psychology, right?
- Oh, no. No, it's the simple truth.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.984
In fact, you're not
safe lying in your bed.

43:25.770 --> 43:29.650
Remember '89?
The next one could be 10 times worse.

43:32.026 --> 43:35.121
You told me-- You told me I
was gonna be safe with you.

43:35.363 --> 43:36.990
You're safe.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.868
We're safe because we died already.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.673
Stop the car.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.375
- Hmm?
- Please, please, just stop the car.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.130
All right.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.338
I'm not dead.

43:53.089 --> 43:54.090
Let me out.

43:54.298 --> 43:57.097
No, you're not. That's not what I meant.

43:57.635 --> 44:01.105
Look. Look at them.

44:01.472 --> 44:04.521
They don't know
what it's like to die in their heads.

44:04.809 --> 44:07.403
We do. We passed through death.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.860
No. That's bullshit.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.033
I didn't die in my head.

44:16.279 --> 44:18.873
My son died.

44:20.241 --> 44:24.212
I wasn't thinking about dying.
I was thinking about...

44:24.453 --> 44:28.208
About what? About how he died?

45:37.985 --> 45:39.532
Now, hit him, hit him, now, now!

45:41.072 --> 45:43.416
- Go, hit him, hit him. Hit him now.
- Go, yes.

45:43.658 --> 45:45.752
- Oh, unbelievable.
- Two in a row, awesome.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.745
- Hello.
- I'm gonna die.

45:47.995 --> 45:48.996
No, don't die.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.003
- Oh, no, we'll get game over-- Oh.
- I died.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.504
Let me try. Thanks.

45:52.708 --> 45:55.302
- Hello.
- Oh, hi. I got to level three.

45:55.544 --> 45:57.171
Then he died.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.841
- Where's your mother?
- I don't know.

46:00.091 --> 46:02.719
Byron's dad called.
He wants to bring him around later.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.395
Do I have to play with him?

46:05.930 --> 46:07.227
No.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.316
Is that that weird
kid that your dad saved?

46:09.517 --> 46:13.488
Yeah. He comes here practically every day
and hangs around my dad.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.152
Go. Yes.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.368
Oh. Hi, darling.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.540
I didn't know you were home.

46:27.243 --> 46:30.213
- Did you meet with Dr. Perlman?
- Yeah.

46:30.830 --> 46:32.332
- Did you talk?
- No.

46:33.958 --> 46:35.050
No?

46:35.251 --> 46:38.300
He took me to meet a woman
whose child died in the crash.

46:38.504 --> 46:42.554
I thought the whole idea was for the two
of you to sit down and talk, one-to-one.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.638
I have a feeling
of overwhelming love for her.

46:49.557 --> 46:52.436
I've never felt anything like it before.

46:59.442 --> 47:03.868
Five, six, seven, eight,
and a little run, a little run.

47:09.994 --> 47:14.170
Slide here, slide, slide, slide.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.884
Skip, skip, hands on your hips.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.048
Change your hands.

47:22.548 --> 47:25.301
Go on, skip.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.477
Change your hands.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.440
Okay. Joan. Stop the music.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.784
Okay, let's rehearse
the piece for the pageant.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.869
- But we don't have Eric.
- No, we don't.

47:44.111 --> 47:47.411
That's right, we don't have Eric. Uh...

47:48.366 --> 47:50.368
We need a volunteer.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.462
Dr. Perlman, perhaps?

47:54.538 --> 47:55.881
Me?

47:56.040 --> 47:57.917
I don't... I don't think-- No.
I don't think so.

48:01.170 --> 48:02.922
Couldn't you get someone else?

48:04.298 --> 48:07.973
No. We need a male. Do you mind?

48:08.219 --> 48:11.598
- What do I have to do exactly?
- Oh, a tree. Just a tree.

48:11.847 --> 48:14.600
Just have to stand here. Like this.

48:15.351 --> 48:18.730
Come on, doctor. It'll be good therapy.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.440
Okay, girls.

48:21.649 --> 48:25.119
Hold hands all around him. Okay.

48:25.319 --> 48:26.992
Joan, some wind music. Okay.

48:28.656 --> 48:33.662
Swirling around like a tornado.
And go in. Ooh.

48:33.869 --> 48:37.840
And down. And, doctor, the tree.
The tree has leaves and branches.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.509
Come on, now, up,
up with your arms. Ooh.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.504
Come on, up with your arms.
And feel the wind.

48:43.712 --> 48:45.555
Swing at the wind.
Come on, doctor, come on.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.258
Ooh.

48:48.884 --> 48:51.433
Well, you've had your revenge.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.862
Look, it's getting worse.

49:00.104 --> 49:02.106
He's more remote and distant than ever.

49:02.314 --> 49:06.820
He's spending more time with the child
from the plane than with his own son.

49:07.069 --> 49:10.619
And I hate that crazy truth-telling
like a robot.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.917
What does he do every day?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.125
He looks at buildings.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.249
- Looks at buildings?
- Yeah, but I mean, I don't mind that.

49:19.498 --> 49:22.627
And I think he might be finding
something new for his work.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.846
- I want to know about this woman.
- Carla?

49:26.046 --> 49:27.093
Mm-hm.

49:28.257 --> 49:31.602
I mean, why did you introduce them?
What were you trying to achieve?

49:31.844 --> 49:33.266
Well, no one can reach her.

49:33.471 --> 49:37.226
If she doesn't get help, she'll end
up in an institution or worse.

49:37.475 --> 49:38.601
And my husband?

49:40.478 --> 49:42.981
- He worries me.
- Why?

49:43.939 --> 49:45.657
I don't know, he...

49:46.233 --> 49:48.656
I think he thinks he's invulnerable.

49:48.903 --> 49:51.372
I've seen it with Vietnam vets.

49:51.614 --> 49:55.494
The high they get
from overcoming their fear.

49:56.368 --> 49:59.212
They become addicted to it.
I thought if I put them together--

49:59.455 --> 50:01.002
They can help each other.

50:01.916 --> 50:03.088
I don't know.

50:04.835 --> 50:08.430
He said he felt overwhelming feeling
of love for her.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.805
A feeling he never felt before.

50:12.343 --> 50:15.222
So, what does that mean?
Is he falling in love with her?

50:16.347 --> 50:17.815
Not in a rational way.

50:18.390 --> 50:19.812
But love isn't rational.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.863
It's not love. He wants to save her.

50:24.522 --> 50:28.993
Save her? And who's saving Max,
or me, for that matter?

50:29.193 --> 50:31.742
Are you playing God?
Are you playing matchmaker?

50:32.279 --> 50:35.078
What are you trying to achieve,
Dr. Perlman?

50:35.574 --> 50:37.918
Trying to help, that's all.

50:39.245 --> 50:41.498
I don't have all the answers.

50:53.509 --> 50:55.557
I can't wait to see
what you're working on.

51:11.819 --> 51:13.787
I'm going to bed now.

51:26.292 --> 51:28.010
Could you turn that down?

51:49.273 --> 51:51.901
- Right down the stairs...
- I am so proud of myself.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.452
I haven't taken one in six days.

51:53.652 --> 51:55.950
- Did I tell you?
- Yes. And I feel great. Thank you.

51:56.155 --> 51:58.408
He chickened out half a mile
from the airport.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.000
- Good that you're here.
- Thanks.

52:00.242 --> 52:03.041
Good to see you, good to see you.
Hi. Manny.

52:03.287 --> 52:06.837
Carla. It's great that you came.

52:07.249 --> 52:09.422
All right, everybody,
we're gonna go downstairs.

52:09.627 --> 52:10.753
Now, you come with me, Carla.

52:10.961 --> 52:12.838
Let's go, everybody, downstairs, please.

52:13.047 --> 52:14.299
All right, come on.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.179
- You wait here, Manny.
- No.

52:16.425 --> 52:18.268
No, it's okay. It's all right.

52:18.469 --> 52:22.064
Carla, I'll be upstairs.

52:26.685 --> 52:29.154
We used to live in tribes.

52:29.355 --> 52:32.199
And when a tribe suffered a disaster...

52:32.399 --> 52:37.530
...an exploding mountain
or shaking of the earth...

52:37.738 --> 52:39.456
...a great flood...

52:39.907 --> 52:42.080
...we would sit around fires...

52:42.284 --> 52:44.582
...and retell the event.

52:45.287 --> 52:47.289
The stories of death...

52:47.956 --> 52:49.253
...destruction...

52:49.458 --> 52:52.211
...escape and rescue.

52:53.545 --> 52:57.300
That's why we're here today.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.895
Would someone...

53:02.638 --> 53:04.606
...tell us their story?

53:09.061 --> 53:10.529
Yes, please.

53:14.441 --> 53:17.069
I lost my sister...

53:17.277 --> 53:19.496
...and my two nephews.

53:20.781 --> 53:23.284
Their seats were ripped away...

53:24.660 --> 53:28.881
...right in front of my eyes.
I could almost reach out.

53:29.456 --> 53:31.584
It's all right.
Let her stand on her own.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.094
Jesus, this is gonna take forever.

53:34.336 --> 53:36.430
I can't stay.
I have to go back to the office.

53:36.672 --> 53:39.175
- What's your name?
- I'm John Wilkenson.

53:39.425 --> 53:41.223
Why were you
on the plane that day?

53:41.427 --> 53:43.521
Going to Houston on business.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.439
You must be very committed
to your work.

53:49.351 --> 53:52.150
Can you go ahead
and finish your story, please?

53:54.314 --> 53:56.112
We were taking a vacation...

53:56.316 --> 53:59.035
...my sister, me, and our kids.

53:59.278 --> 54:02.452
You know, no husbands.

54:02.656 --> 54:06.661
We saw all the dumb tourist sights
together like when we were girls.

54:06.869 --> 54:09.839
Only this time we were also mommies.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.007
And now we'll never be together again.

54:17.880 --> 54:21.225
Let's just talk about
the day of the crash.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.310
What happened when the plane hit?

54:26.054 --> 54:27.727
I don't know. Um...

54:30.642 --> 54:32.736
I guess I closed my eyes.

54:32.978 --> 54:37.074
There was incredible noise
and I couldn't see.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.618
I was choking on the smoke.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.739
I didn't think that we
had long to live.

54:43.238 --> 54:46.708
And then that man-- Is he here?

54:47.409 --> 54:49.207
Are you here, Max Klein?

54:53.165 --> 54:55.008
He couldn't come.

54:56.084 --> 54:57.757
He saved my life.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.300
How did he do that?

55:02.299 --> 55:05.929
We couldn't see anything,
and it was all smoke.

55:06.136 --> 55:10.437
We couldn't even breathe,
and I heard the sound of his voice.

55:11.475 --> 55:15.355
He was shouting,
"Follow me, this way."

55:15.604 --> 55:19.529
I had hold of my kids,
and I just followed his voice.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.204
He sounded so normal.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.743
"Follow me to the light."

55:30.953 --> 55:33.001
I was scared.

55:33.413 --> 55:35.757
But I saw him jump...

55:35.999 --> 55:38.377
...and call out:

55:40.087 --> 55:41.760
"We're alive."

55:43.298 --> 55:45.266
So I followed...

55:45.592 --> 55:47.720
...and then we were in the cornfield.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.563
Safe.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.600
I would have gone the wrong way.

55:53.725 --> 55:58.196
- I came here today hoping to thank him.
- Same thing happened to me.

55:58.397 --> 56:00.741
- I followed him too.
- Excuse me, you're leaving us?

56:01.817 --> 56:04.661
I don't belong here.
I wasn't on the plane.

56:04.903 --> 56:05.904
Who are you?

56:06.572 --> 56:09.291
My son died in the crash. I'm sorry.

56:09.491 --> 56:12.961
No, that's okay. It's all right.
Why did you come?

56:15.080 --> 56:16.832
I don't know.

56:17.332 --> 56:19.005
I wanted...

56:19.334 --> 56:22.463
If anyone had seen my son...

56:22.671 --> 56:24.548
...or knew how...

56:24.756 --> 56:25.757
I'm sorry.

56:25.966 --> 56:28.060
- What was his name?
- Where was he sitting?

56:28.260 --> 56:29.682
They said he was in 21C.

56:30.971 --> 56:32.894
That was right behind me.

56:34.641 --> 56:38.987
- Did he have red hair?
- Yes, kind of reddish-brown.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.148
- Tall man?
- Six feet.

56:41.398 --> 56:44.277
- And, um, a mustache?
- Yes.

56:45.027 --> 56:46.028
You mean me.

56:46.737 --> 56:49.206
Remember? We talked at the hospital.

56:50.324 --> 56:52.543
Actually, we were on the other side
of the plane.

56:54.244 --> 56:58.340
Sorry. Tsk.
Since it happened, I get confused, heh.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.504
Anyone else remember that row?

57:03.712 --> 57:07.888
Twenty-one-C was three rows ahead of me.
They were smashed, flat.

57:08.091 --> 57:11.846
- Can anyone else help?
- Go ahead. Say something.

57:13.221 --> 57:16.691
- Anyone else have information?
- Stop it.

57:17.309 --> 57:19.277
Just let her go.

57:19.478 --> 57:20.900
Why?

57:23.148 --> 57:24.695
This isn't doing anybody any good.

57:24.900 --> 57:26.823
She wants to know
what happened to her son.

57:27.069 --> 57:30.164
- My son died.
- Yes, but you know how he died.

57:31.198 --> 57:32.950
You were with him.

57:36.203 --> 57:38.205
When was the last time
you saw your son?

57:38.455 --> 57:41.379
His birthday. About a month before.

57:41.583 --> 57:43.881
I don't remember kissing him goodbye.

57:44.086 --> 57:47.761
I know I did, but I just can't remember.

57:48.924 --> 57:49.971
You're very young.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.016
I'm not young.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.268
How old was your boy?

57:58.475 --> 58:00.193
He was almost 2.

58:00.852 --> 58:01.899
I'm sorry.

58:02.145 --> 58:05.820
- He wasn't with you for very long.
- Jesus Christ! This is sadistic.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.947
And we're not accomplishing anything.

58:10.988 --> 58:12.661
Hello.

58:13.407 --> 58:14.909
Hello.

58:17.536 --> 58:18.753
Do you remember me?

58:19.413 --> 58:22.166
I'm Lisa, the flight attendant.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.092
Yes.

58:28.130 --> 58:30.132
I really wanted to see you.

58:31.967 --> 58:34.937
I came here mostly to see you.

58:37.514 --> 58:40.267
I think about you and your baby a lot.

58:43.562 --> 58:47.066
Do you remember how I tried
to help you with the seat belt?

58:47.733 --> 58:49.451
Help me?

58:50.110 --> 58:52.329
You told me that everything
was going to be okay.

58:52.529 --> 58:54.156
You think you helped me?

58:54.406 --> 58:57.501
- Well, I tried, I--
- Tried?

58:57.743 --> 59:00.587
You told me to hold him. I couldn't.

59:00.829 --> 59:02.923
You told me everything
was going to be okay!

59:03.165 --> 59:06.089
- It wasn't!
- Please, don't say that. I didn't...

59:07.502 --> 59:09.470
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know what?

59:09.921 --> 59:12.015
- Please, I'm sorry.
- You told me to hold him.

59:12.257 --> 59:14.100
- You knew I couldn't!
- It's not my fault.

59:14.301 --> 59:17.054
All right. We're not here
to blame each other, okay?

59:17.304 --> 59:19.807
You said everything was going
to be okay, and it wasn't.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.354
He died!

59:27.022 --> 59:29.491
You want everybody to talk.

59:30.067 --> 59:33.492
- But only if they say nice things, right?
- No, that's not true.

59:35.155 --> 59:36.281
My son died!

59:36.490 --> 59:39.539
And blaming her
won't bring your baby back.

59:45.165 --> 59:46.166
Carla.

59:47.292 --> 59:48.669
Carla.

59:49.669 --> 59:51.342
Carla!

59:52.923 --> 59:55.221
Well, of course they think it's fair.

59:55.467 --> 59:58.516
So what? What do you think?

59:59.513 --> 01:00:00.856
I'm being fucked.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:04.978
Why the big law firms
are getting much more for their clients?

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.278
Hey, I'll get another lawyer.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:11.200
Mr. Brillstein, I heard a woman
got $2 million for her dead baby...

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.948
...and I think I should
get at least that.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:18.616
I'll call you. I'll call you every day.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:20.497
Goodbye.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.795
Uh, you have to understand.
They owe us.

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.717
They killed him and they have to pay.

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:33.297
You don't understand a fucking thing.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.428
I understand, Manny.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.976
I understand that I'm alone.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.104
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:45.730
<i>So pain and
suffering are compensable.</i>

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:48.403
Apart from the other
compensable losses...

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:52.358
...such as the $2 million
Nutty Nick Stores contract.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.068
We didn't have a contract.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.786
- Whose side are you on?
- Take it easy, Nan.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.365
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You have a husband...

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:02.702
...and the partnership insurance.
- I have a deposition...

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:08.924
...from Mr. Nutty Nick
that he had every intention...

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:12.966
...of hiring Mr. Gordon and Mr. Klein.
That's good enough.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.547
- He's lying.
- Okay.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.006
It's nice, but he's lying.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.966
- All right--
- Hold on.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:19.347
Do me a favor.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.637
Don't say that.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:25.065
They don't have to know your opinion,
okay?

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:28.230
Now, are you gonna work with me on this,
Mr. Klein?

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:29.436
I'm sorry.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:32.523
You promised to do your best
for Mrs. Gordon and her children.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:36.235
- You get a third of what we get, right?
- I know. I'm terrible.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:40.034
One-third is standard, Mr. Klein.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:43.583
Naturally, it's in my interest to get
as large a settlement as possible.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:45.285
In fact, that's my job.

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:47.166
I don't apologize for it.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.499
Oh, no, this is America in the '90s.
Nobody apologizes anymore.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:51.959
They write a memoir.

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:56.468
Mr. Klein, this is the law,
not some trick I invented.

01:01:56.671 --> 01:02:00.676
Each minute that you and Mr. Gordon
knew that you were going to die...

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:04.104
...is compensable as pain and suffering.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:08.146
Testify to the mental anguish
that you and Mr. Gordon experienced...

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:11.024
...and each minute is worth dollars.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:15.108
Big dollars. Dollars to which
you and Mrs. Gordon are entitled.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.117
What you really want me to say...

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:20.992
...is that Jeff wept
at the prospect of his wife widowed...

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.664
...and his children orphaned.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.332
It's a shame he died instantly.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:27.661
If only he had been mashed up and died
slowly in my arms, then...

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.337
...Nan could...
- Jesus! Max.

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:32.256
- ...really make out on this.
- Fine. Good night.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.343
Are you ashamed of me? Is that it?

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:41.675
I'm trying to make money
off my dead husband...

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:43.931
...so I don't meet
your standards of widowhood?

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:45.971
Let me ask you something.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:47.852
If Jeff was here, what would he do?

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:50.942
Oh, come on, Max, tell me.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:52.440
I can't lie.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:55.693
If you had died and he had lived,
what would he be willing to say...

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.149
...to help Laura and Jonah?

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.660
Look, I know that he ripped you off
for the tickets--

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.238
We don't know that.
Maybe he was gonna pay him back.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.244
Are you punishing Jeff?

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:09.461
Okay.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.330
Okay, I'll say what you want.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.832
<i>Let it go.</i>

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.420
<i>I can let it go.</i>

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.421
I can't live as a coward.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.712
Oh, fuck.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.735
So I argued that it wasn't fair to us,
and he agreed.

01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:30.320
He just said, "Life is unfair."

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:34.158
And he changed the test to next week,
and it's on Europe, not Central America.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:36.242
I think he proved his
own point, didn't he?

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:38.749
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.052
So, what did you do today, Dad?

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:48.755
Well...

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.850
...go ahead.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.638
Tell him.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.140
What? What did you do?

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.404
Talk to me.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.575
Tell me what's going on.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:15.240
Talk to me, Max!

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:26.380
Every day, you have to jump off a roof
or stand in front of a train...

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.803
...so you can lose your fear?
Is that it?

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:30.801
What about me?

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:32.097
What about Jonah?

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.967
You're like a crazy person.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.724
- I'm not crazy.
- Black is white and...

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:41.559
I love you.
We have lived together for 16 years.

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:43.063
They have been great.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:48.148
- Oh, not always.
- Yes. Always.

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:50.529
They've always been great for me.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:53.202
Even when I hate you, I know I love you.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.328
I know you were happy too.

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:03.917
Remember?

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.731
Do you remember our marriage?

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.777
Even if I could remember, then what?

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.156
How can I live in the memory?

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.997
You see, that's cruel.
Do you know that's cruel?

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:40.700
- That's the truth.
- The truth?

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:43.206
You didn't tell Jonah the truth.

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:47.875
- It was very unfair to use him that way.
- Fair?

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.005
You tell me what's fair.
What am I supposed to do?

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.801
Let you kill yourself?

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:55.223
Hey, I walked away from that crash
with my life. That's what survived.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:58.267
- The taste and touch and beauty of life.
- But I love that.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:01.095
- I won't give that up.
- I don't want you to give it up.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.890
Let me in.

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:06.145
Let me be part of it.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.270
You can't.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.492
- I wish I'd been on that plane.
- I'm grateful you weren't.

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.035
But you don't make sense.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:18.533
You said it was extraordinary,
so beautiful.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:22.618
You're right, I don't make sense,
and I don't want to.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:33.303
I know that what you found is special.
Whatever it is...

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.881
...and wherever it leads you,
it's thrilling.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.470
But there must be a way...

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.636
...to live with it
so that it does make sense.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:50.103
I'm going to survive this.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.689
I can't fight for you anymore.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:56.697
You want to destroy yourself?
I can't stop you.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.200
I hope you make it.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:45.909
- You been dreaming a lot?
- Hmm, you bet.

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:47.710
Me too.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:50.963
Were you alone on the plane?

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:54.634
No, I was with my best friend,
my partner.

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:57.712
- He was decapitated.
- Hmm.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.507
- You saw him?
- Mm-hm.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.099
Well...

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:13.024
...I should be going.
- Thanks for coming.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.159
You know...

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:23.371
...if Manny has any interest
in doing carpentry full time...

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.537
...there's some people that I can talk to,
uh, that would be happy...

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:29.085
...to work with somebody like him.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.000
Don't talk about my husband.

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:33.878
Oh, sorry.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.922
No, no, it's all right, it's...
I'm angry with him, that's why.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.469
Oh. Oh.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:46.595
- Don't look so scared.
- I'm not scared.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.931
I'm not scared of anything.

01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:50.690
You're scared to kiss me.

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.520
- I just did kiss you.
- I mean for real.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.573
I didn't want to offend you.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.245
You're right.

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:07.202
I don't wanna be kissed.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:09.204
I don't want anything.

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:20.549
But I do wanna go with you
next time you take a drive.

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.854
Oh, look, I'm missing the swans.

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:40.986
When did this start? Oh, it's beautiful.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:51.452
Kate is so serious, isn't she?

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:52.876
Oh, look.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.624
Adorable. Ha, ha.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:57.795
Bravo!

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.376
Beautiful.

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:01.134
Beautiful.

01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:07.387
Wonderful.

01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:09.677
Wonderful.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.176
<i>Folks, this is the captain here.</i>

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:46.256
<i>We're going to, uh, make an emergency
landing at Bakersfield Airport.</i>

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:48.432
<i>I'll come back to you
just before touchdown.</i>

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:50.806
<i>At that time, you'll hear me say,
"Brace, brace, brace. "</i>

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:55.773
<i>Hi, this is Nan.
I'll call you back as soon as possible. Bye.</i>

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:57.816
<i>I want you to go into
the crash positions...</i>

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:00.896
<i>...which your cabin attendants
will illustrate.</i>

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:07.987
<i>I'm not going to kid you, it's going to
be rough, maybe worse than that.</i>

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:11.198
<i>Pay attention
to what the cabin attendants tell you...</i>

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:13.703
<i>...and good luck to us all.</i>

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.347
- Could we be excused?
- Bring a bag of chips. One each.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:34.850
- Stop it. Let's play our game.
- Jonah!

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.348
- But I...
- Oh, no, let them go.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:39.399
It's a mistake to make anything
but hamburgers.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.025
Next time,
we'll just have relish and ketchup.

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:46.199
What can you do?
I don't mind as long as they're happy.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.993
If we're gonna have Thanksgiving,
let's do it right.

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:52.368
Jonah! Jonah!

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:55.415
Oh, Max, don't play super dad.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:59.371
Byron, honey, no.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:04.713
Give me this, give me this.
This is garbage. It's worse than garbage.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.386
- What are you doing?
- Go back to the table and finish.

01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:10.180
- Max, I want you to calm down.
- I'm calm. Listen to me.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:13.430
I'm throwing this out. When you
die, you don't get another life.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:15.227
They don't know
what you're talking about.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.522
- Do you understand?
- It's not real, it's only pretend.

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:20.350
- I know what dead bodies look like.
- Shut up!

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:22.151
- Jonah.
- It's going in the garbage.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:25.525
- Give him a break. He's a little boy.
- If it was up to you, he'd stay that way.

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:27.357
I don't care about the stupid game.

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.404
- Don't be cruel!
- I don't want him to grow up...

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.326
...to be a frightened child
in a man's body.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.576
He's just fine, Max.
It's you who is in trouble.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:39.627
Now, give the game back.
Or keep on going, but right out of our lives.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.084
Our son is innocent, Max.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:47.795
Do you want to crash our marriage?
Okay, but don't hurt our son.

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:49.921
I'm not scared to end our marriage.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:53.140
Neither am I.

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.518
Then I'll keep on going.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.435
Good.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:16:59.156
- Ahem.
- Where to?

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:00.532
Beautiful downtown Oakland.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.960
- Oakland? Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:48.585
- Such a shame.
- Yeah.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:53.044
It was gonna be gentrified and rebuilt,
but then the recession hit.

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:56.218
- The country's falling apart.
- Yeah.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:18:02.395
The United States is finished.
But you and me, we're in peak condition.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:22.615
Ahem. You hungry?

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.000
In there?

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.920
Remember, we're ghosts.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.248
They can't do anything to us.

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:31.673
You're really nuts, you know?

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:32.966
- You are so crazy.
- Ha, ha.

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:35.215
Yeah, you should talk.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.554
- Whoa.
- Ow.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:54.401
- Oh, damn.
- Jake, I can't believe you did that.

01:18:54.605 --> 01:18:59.031
I'm not buying you another one, I'm not.
Look at this mess. I've had it!

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:02.455
- We're going home.
- So happy.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.648
Maybe I am a ghost.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:34.042
I was gonna buy him a lot of presents.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.927
Well, let's do it. Let's buy them.

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:44.132
What did he like? Hmm?

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.014
How about a sword?
My son used to love swords.

01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:50.187
- He still does, but he's too old to admit it.
- What?

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:52.355
What would your son like?

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:56.019
Does he play with Legos?
No, he's too young for that.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:58.274
Oh. Bristle Blocks.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:20:59.856
Does he have those? They're great.

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:02.066
Babies can use them,
older kids like them for years.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:04.618
You want me to buy a present
for Bubble?

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:08.789
- Bubble. Now, is that really his name?
- It's Leonardo. I called him Bubble.

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:12.243
- I can't buy presents for him, that's sick.
- Why?

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:13.953
Because he's dead.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.630
- Of course Bubble is dead.
- You're not serious.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.003
You wouldn't do this to me.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.802
What, you gonna buy presents
for your dead father?

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.256
My father.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.476
I never bought him anything.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.428
I'm sorry.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:34.311
I didn't mean it. I just don't
think that it's a good idea.

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.734
I made him something in school.

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:38.686
Carved his name in wood.
Made a little...

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:42.398
Those little, uh, nameplates
that you put on your desk.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.114
I was 13 when he died...

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:49.321
...and never had a chance
to buy him a real present.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.952
Let's do it.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:53.033
Let's buy presents for the dead.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.878
Come on.
Let's buy presents for the dead.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.830
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.631
Come on!

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:02.130
Who are we gonna give them to?

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:07.507
He liked to build things.
Shelves and chairs.

01:22:07.714 --> 01:22:09.182
He made our dining room table.

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:12.262
Sometimes he'd give me a hammer,
let me do the easy stuff.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.267
Here, here we go.

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:16.515
Oh, yeah.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:19.102
This is it. This is what he'd like.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:23.823
Every time we came into a hardware store,
Dad would stop in front of one of these.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:26.650
It wasn't as magnificent as this one.

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:29.740
He'd be...

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.073
...totally silent...

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.584
...and then he'd say:

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.087
"I'd like to have that"...

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.794
...and walk away.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.798
Only thing I ever heard him say
he wanted.

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:48.756
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:53.594
- I'd like to buy this for my father.
- That's nice. I'll take care of that for you.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:00.109
I've gotta get him a monster.
He just loves them.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.437
All right. I'll find him something.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.530
- Hey, Max.
- Hmm?

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:11.863
- Come here.
- Oh, look at this. This is great.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.991
Wah.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.043
Hey, do you mind? Excuse me.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:22.623
Sorry.

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:26.509
Look what I have for us.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:30.427
A beautiful bevy of desserts. Now...

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:31.723
...this.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:33.842
Nope. Don't want any.

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:36.145
- We should take that as a paperweight.
- Ha, ha.

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:39.144
- I want that.
- This is the only thing you can't have.

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:43.899
Yes. This is the only thing.
Now, I have several other magical...

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.939
I have some magic mushrooms for you.

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:49.696
- Mushroom, no.
- Or better yet...

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:54.572
...the beautiful simplicity
of a ripe strawberry.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.781
Hmm?

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:19.855
Let's dance.

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:23.021
- Come on.
- No, I don't dance.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.024
Oh, yeah. Come on. Up you go.

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:31.699
Yeah.

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:34.111
Hold on!

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:38.540
Oh, I'm dizzy.
- whee.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:01.271
- Good night.
- So I'll pick you up?

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:02.688
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay?

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:06.226
- My goodness, it's night.
- Uh-huh.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.872
Where are we going?

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:24.211
We could disappear.

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:40.598
You all right?

01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.394
What's wrong?

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.476
Max.

01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:50.529
What?

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.908
There's something that
I gotta tell you.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:59.739
You gotta promise that you'll never
tell anybody, okay?

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.660
All right.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.087
Oh, Max.

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:18.974
- You--
- All right, calm down, now.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:20.642
What is it?

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:22.974
What?

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:27.437
I wanna tell you something
that nobody knows.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:29.567
Do you remember...

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:31.862
...just when we touched ground...

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:33.985
...and it was like
we were gonna land okay?

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.657
Yeah.

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:41.488
What?

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:47.623
I let go of Bubble.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:52.833
I had him in my lap.
I looked at the road...

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:56.466
and I thought we were gonna be safe,
and the wheels bumped in.

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:58.843
I opened my arms.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:02.343
I was safe in my belt, but he wasn't.

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:04.804
Oh, I see. So it was your fault, hmm?

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:08.311
- It wasn't the accident?
- I wasn't holding him.

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:12.190
- You killed your baby?
- Yes. And the lawyer.

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:15.068
- Brillstein?
- I didn't tell him the truth.

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:18.116
- Manny wants the money--
- I understand. So you're also a liar?

01:27:18.316 --> 01:27:19.533
Yes!

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:23.035
Yes, I lied! I lied to Father Conti!

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:24.706
I lied in the confessional.

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:26.829
I lied to the whole church.
To everybody.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:28.956
- Carla, it wasn't your fault.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:31.129
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:33.172
- Carla, it's not your fault.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:34.750
Carla.

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:37.135
Hail Mary, full of grace.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:39.337
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou...

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:42.265
- Carla, I didn't--
- Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:45.436
- Holy Mary, Mother of God...
- I didn't mean you killed your baby.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:49.105
- ...at the hour of our death. Amen.
- Carla, you're not to blame.

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.269
There's no way you could have
held on to your baby!

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:56.071
We were going hundreds
of miles an hour.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:02.615
Of course you think it's your fault.

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:05.868
God gave you a child,
it was your job to keep him safe.

01:28:06.072 --> 01:28:07.915
But it's not your fault!

01:28:09.326 --> 01:28:12.000
Stop it now!
Come on, stop it now! That's enough!

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:16.542
Carla, I...

01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:20.929
Oh, shit.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.598
No, oh, shit.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.478
What have I done?

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:41.325
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:55.455
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:58.042
...now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:59.672
Hail Mary, full of grace...

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:02.720
Carla, come on now.
I want you to get in the back.

01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:06.178
Come on.

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:09.135
Come on.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:10.971
Come on now.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.772
Come on.

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:15.021
Our Lord is with thee.

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:16.852
Carla.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:22.442
Just get in the back now. That's it.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.912
Okay.

01:29:32.659 --> 01:29:35.208
This is your baby.

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:37.756
No. I want you to hold it upright,
like this.

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:40.755
I know it doesn't look like a baby,
it looks like a toolbox.

01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:44.634
It is a toolbox! I want you to pretend
that this is your baby.

01:29:44.838 --> 01:29:46.306
Pretend it's Bubble.

01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:48.349
Okay? Now, this is your chance...

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:52.680
...to hold on tight, to save him. Okay?

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:01.563
Okay, now.

01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:24.590
Hold on to Bubble.

01:30:26.004 --> 01:30:27.881
As tight as you can.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:40.185
Pray to God to give you the strength
to save your baby.

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:50.036
Hold on to your baby!

01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:56.084
Holy Mary, Mother of God!

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.378
Pray for us now
and at the hour of our death!

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:43.920
- Right behind you. Careful, please.
- Yes.

01:31:52.382 --> 01:31:53.429
Mrs. Rodrigo.

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:57.141
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay, it's just whiplash.

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:59.063
- I was with Max.
- I know, I know.

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:03.360
He's in intensive care, he'll be all right.
Just between us...

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.483
...what happened?

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:08.987
- He was showing me something.
- What? That brick walls are hard?

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:12.824
How did you get here so fast?

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:19.623
My beeper went off. I was two blocks away.
I don't know, I've been really lucky lately.

01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:21.499
I mean, I know it's terrible...

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:24.081
...to talk about luck
when you've suffered so much.

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:25.541
Have you seen a doctor yet?

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:27.422
- No.
- No?

01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:29.878
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:34.057
- What happened?
- Mr. Klein drove into a brick wall.

01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:36.259
- What?
- You don't understand.

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:39.813
The flight attendant told me
to hold Bubble.

01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:42.562
I thought
I wasn't holding him tight enough.

01:32:42.766 --> 01:32:45.610
I didn't think
that my hands were together when we hit.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.780
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Let's be careful
about what we're not sure of.

01:32:49.939 --> 01:32:53.660
Manny, I thought I could save him.

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:56.283
Max showed me that I couldn't have.
There was no way.

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:59.662
- Wait, he crashed the car on purpose?
- Yes, to show me!

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:02.119
That's it.
That nut ain't gonna come close to you.

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.704
Just a minute.
Come here.

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:06.631
Listen, listen, listen.
Our case is good.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:09.129
Actually, we could even improve
our numbers here.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:22.889
Hi.

01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:25.442
- You must be Jonah.
- Yeah.

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:28.646
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
Is your mom home?

01:33:28.853 --> 01:33:31.322
Yeah, come in. Mom!

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:36.823
Mom!

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:40.157
- Uh, there's a woman to see you.
- I know.

01:33:40.406 --> 01:33:41.623
- I think--
- Go to your room.

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:43.793
- I was just--
- Go to your room!

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:11.192
Hi, I'm Carla.

01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:13.774
I know who you are.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:19.363
This is a very nice house that you have.

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.619
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:38.432
You know, I'm sorry to bother you
like this, but I thought that it would...

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:40.141
...be good if we talked.

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:41.433
Mm-hm.

01:34:47.557 --> 01:34:48.649
I called the hospital.

01:34:49.392 --> 01:34:52.646
They said that Max is, um, doing okay.

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:54.606
Well, I don't think he's doing okay.

01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:03.990
How are you?

01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:07.586
Oh, I'm okay. I really wasn't hurt.

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:14.759
You know, I came by because I...

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.382
Well, I just wanted to say, you know...

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:20.931
Well, I can, uh...

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:24.511
...imagine what you must be feeling
about what has happened.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:26.346
Really?

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:29.474
You can?

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:35.317
I know you must be angry with me,
and you have every right to.

01:35:35.521 --> 01:35:37.398
I'm not angry with you.

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:40.110
Why should I be angry be with you?
Wasn't it Max's idea?

01:35:40.318 --> 01:35:42.946
- I know it was a crazy--
- He must be in love with you.

01:35:43.154 --> 01:35:45.282
- It's not like that.
- To risk his life for you.

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:46.491
- No.
- Isn't that love?

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:48.167
No!

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:58.587
Look, um, I'm sorry.

01:35:58.962 --> 01:36:01.511
I didn't come here to argue with you...

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:04.346
...and I think I'd better go. I'm sorry.

01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:05.885
No, please stay.

01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:15.608
Okay.

01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:24.746
I am very sorry about your little boy.

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:32.788
Thank you.

01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:40.841
You know...

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:44.549
...when he died...

01:36:44.966 --> 01:36:46.843
...I had nothing.

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:51.143
I couldn't feel anything.

01:36:55.393 --> 01:36:57.862
Now I can feel something.

01:36:58.354 --> 01:37:02.530
I can feel something inside
besides the pain for Bubble.

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:05.866
That's because of Max.

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:11.251
He would talk to me. I mean, he'd
talk to me like nobody else ever has.

01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:14.580
We would have these great conversations,
and they were weird...

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:17.256
...but they were so exciting...

01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:22.761
It's not what you think.

01:37:23.796 --> 01:37:25.798
He's my friend.

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:29.094
He's my best friend.
It's like God sent him to me.

01:37:29.302 --> 01:37:31.475
It's like he sent me my own angel.

01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:38.691
Let me be honest with you, Carla.

01:37:42.607 --> 01:37:46.077
Maybe this wonderful friendship
that you have...

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:48.200
...might have helped you.

01:37:48.738 --> 01:37:51.287
But it hasn't helped Max.

01:37:52.158 --> 01:37:54.536
Maybe our marriage is over.

01:37:55.161 --> 01:37:59.632
But I have a son,
and I want him to have a father.

01:38:03.503 --> 01:38:06.507
Max is not an angel.

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:08.307
He's a man.

01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:11.936
He cannot survive up there.

01:38:36.494 --> 01:38:38.087
- Hey, you-
- Hey.

01:38:38.287 --> 01:38:39.880
How you doing?

01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:42.792
I got you these, um, chocolates.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.719
- I figure that's what they give patients now.
- Unh.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.297
Here.

01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:50.057
- How's your head?
- Hurts.

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:54.767
You know, I just...

01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:59.727
I really wanna just tell you how much...

01:39:05.064 --> 01:39:07.567
I just wanted to say
how wonderful you are.

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:10.494
You look happy.

01:39:12.238 --> 01:39:14.491
You know,
it's probably because Manny moved out.

01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:17.251
I told him to.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:20.046
- Are you all right with that?
- Yeah.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:26.219
You know, um, I visited Bubble's grave.

01:39:26.919 --> 01:39:29.138
For the first time, it was okay.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.550
I'm glad.

01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:38.439
But, you know...

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.519
...things can't go back to the way
that they were.

01:39:43.686 --> 01:39:45.484
You know what I mean?

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.653
I want you to go home, Max.

01:39:52.445 --> 01:39:54.573
I want you to live again.

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:57.951
Heh. I'm not a ghost anymore.

01:40:01.078 --> 01:40:03.046
I can't get back.

01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:06.008
Yes, you can.

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:10.346
- I don't want to.
- Oh, Max.

01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:15.385
I wish I could help you, Max.

01:40:18.387 --> 01:40:20.936
We could disappear, Carla.

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.982
I can't anymore.

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.232
I'm back.

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:33.574
I want to try living on planet Earth
for a while, heh.

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:38.958
You can't save everybody, Max.

01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:43.413
You gotta try taking care of yourself.

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:51.800
Say goodbye, Max.

01:40:53.923 --> 01:40:56.221
Goodbye?
Well, why do we have to say goodbye?

01:41:00.137 --> 01:41:02.811
Because it has to be that way.

01:41:03.474 --> 01:41:04.646
I don't wanna say goodbye.

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:09.064
Just...

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:13.113
Just say it like it means nothing.

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:17.113
Bye, Max.

01:41:30.626 --> 01:41:33.846
Please, Max, say it.

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.598
Bye, Carla.

01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:30.644
"The soul comes to the end
of its long journey...

01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:35.820
...and naked and alone,
draws near to the divine."

01:45:34.745 --> 01:45:36.543
How you feeling?

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:41.502
Okay.

01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:46.678
- A hundred and one point four.
- Hmm.

01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:49.598
Let's see.

01:45:59.395 --> 01:46:00.772
Are you gonna stay?

01:46:02.523 --> 01:46:04.901
I don't know. We'll see.

01:46:08.445 --> 01:46:10.243
Sorry about the video game.

01:46:11.532 --> 01:46:13.409
It's okay. You didn't break it.

01:46:14.243 --> 01:46:16.120
Heh. Good.

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:35.916
What is it, Max?

01:47:40.537 --> 01:47:42.631
I want you to save me.

01:48:06.438 --> 01:48:08.281
- These are for you.
- Okay, thank you.

01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:10.075
Ah, you're here. Great.

01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:12.323
Listen, it may be premature.

01:48:12.528 --> 01:48:16.158
I don't wanna jinx it, but I think I'm
gonna have it all locked up tomorrow.

01:48:16.365 --> 01:48:20.871
So champagne, assorted goodies,
a little celebration.

01:48:21.036 --> 01:48:22.538
It's an incredible story.

01:48:23.747 --> 01:48:26.421
Because of your suicide attempt--
Don't argue.

01:48:26.625 --> 01:48:28.298
That's how I presented it to them...

01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:31.472
...that you were suffering
from post-traumatic stress syndrome...

01:48:31.672 --> 01:48:35.051
...and that they were gonna be
on the hook if you killed yourself.

01:48:35.259 --> 01:48:37.637
I know, I'm terrible. Ha, ha.

01:48:37.845 --> 01:48:41.190
What a situation.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

01:48:41.557 --> 01:48:43.400
It's incredible. Ha, ha.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.195
Anyway, this morning I hondled
with Intercity's lawyer for hours...

01:48:47.396 --> 01:48:48.397
...and we got close...

01:48:48.605 --> 01:48:53.327
...really close, to big dollars for you,
Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Rodrigo.

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:56.246
But I think we're gonna make out
like bandits.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:49:00.497
I know, I'm horrible.
But listen to this. Ha, ha.

01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:03.204
An hour after I get the call
from the airline lawyer...

01:49:03.412 --> 01:49:06.131
...I get one from the insurance carrier.
Ha, ha.

01:49:06.331 --> 01:49:10.461
What a situation! I mean,
I know I'm terrible to take advantage...

01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:13.297
...but there's been some fuckup
in their communication.

01:49:13.505 --> 01:49:15.678
They both think
they're the one designated...

01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:18.136
...to negotiate with me. Ha, ha.

01:49:18.343 --> 01:49:20.641
So I played dumb.

01:49:20.846 --> 01:49:22.974
Started doing numbers
with the insurance guy...

01:49:23.182 --> 01:49:26.356
...and his offers are even higher.
Ha, ha.

01:49:27.352 --> 01:49:29.650
- Millions, we're talking millions.
- No, Max!

01:49:30.522 --> 01:49:31.944
- Oh, shit.
- Max.

01:49:35.486 --> 01:49:36.863
Max.

01:49:41.033 --> 01:49:42.660
<i>This is it.</i>

01:49:42.868 --> 01:49:44.745
<i>This is the moment of my death.</i>

01:49:52.461 --> 01:49:53.633
We're gonna make it, Max.

01:49:53.837 --> 01:49:56.431
He's gonna bring us in.
He's gonna bring us in.

01:49:56.632 --> 01:49:59.101
- There's a boy alone up there.
- What?

01:49:59.301 --> 01:50:00.894
I'm gonna sit with him.

01:50:01.095 --> 01:50:03.473
Max. Max.

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.182
It's gonna be okay.

01:50:56.733 --> 01:50:58.201
<i>You're gonna be all right.</i>

01:51:39.818 --> 01:51:41.741
<i>Go, please. Back to your seat.</i>

01:51:51.079 --> 01:51:52.581
Everything's okay.

01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:03.224
All right, now put your head down.

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:07.187
Close your eyes.

01:52:07.846 --> 01:52:10.019
It'll be over soon.

01:52:10.849 --> 01:52:13.068
Everything's wonderful.

01:53:32.055 --> 01:53:34.524
In the kitchen there is a phone!

01:53:34.725 --> 01:53:37.353
It's an emergency,
it's an allergic reaction!

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.277
- Jonah!
- What's happening?

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:46.862
What's happening, Dad?

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:49.034
Dad!

01:53:52.784 --> 01:53:55.037
<i>Dad!</i>

01:54:24.649 --> 01:54:26.071
No, Max, no, no!

01:54:30.781 --> 01:54:33.455
<i>Follow me to the light.</i>

01:54:33.658 --> 01:54:34.625
Max!

01:54:34.826 --> 01:54:37.625
No! Max! No, Max!

01:54:52.719 --> 01:54:55.097
No, Max! No!

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:57.728
Max! Max!

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:00.769
<i>No! No, Max!</i>

01:55:05.774 --> 01:55:08.948
<i>Max! Max!</i>

01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:27.512
I'm alive.

01:55:30.549 --> 01:55:32.392
I'm alive.

01:55:47.691 --> 01:55:49.159
I'm alive.
