00:43.643 --> 00:45.744
Here we go.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.151
Whoa-ho-ho!
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:05.065 --> 01:06.231
<i>Rise and shine, beautiful.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.518
Here you go, buddy.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.786
Oh, thank you.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.254
I still use these.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.198
<i>What took you so long?</i>

01:39.200 --> 01:41.700
They forgot the Mu Shu pork,
and it's your favorite.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.140
Kids, come on!
Food's ready, let's go, inside!

01:48.142 --> 01:49.675
Susan, you hungry?

01:51.678 --> 01:53.612
<i>- Bruce's book...
- Hmm.</i>

01:53.614 --> 01:56.415
Hedging Your Bet Against
God <i>By Bruce Brooks.</i>

01:56.417 --> 01:59.418
That's a great fucking title.
What's the book about?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.186
Well, the way I see it,

02:01.188 --> 02:03.622
was there's a Bible
for the afterlife.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.357
I wrote the Bible
for the here and now.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.294
I'm actually not kidding.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.630
And people can say
all they want about insurance,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.232
and guys like me,
but you know what?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.467
At the end of the day,
having good insurance

02:15.469 --> 02:16.502
is the most important thing
you can do while you're alive.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.604
<i>Every time you up it,</i>

02:18.606 --> 02:20.839
<i>you're just hedging your bet against God,
am I right?</i>

02:27.313 --> 02:29.181
<i>What are you doing?</i>

02:29.183 --> 02:31.683
Come on sit back down, Laney.
Everyone's enjoying the food.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.452
The ribs are sour.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.686
How would you know?
You didn't even eat them.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.456
Laney, come on, sit down.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.871
<i>Daddy...
Where'd you get that dog?</i>

02:52.873 --> 02:55.207
We rescued him from the pound.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.477
Janey, Bingo was supposed
to be a surprise for mommy.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.445
Mommy, I think he needs you.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.553
<i>We talked about this.</i>

03:07.555 --> 03:11.490
No, you talked about this.
We didn't talk about anything.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.958
Can you just give it a try?
Can you trust me?

03:14.861 --> 03:16.361
Fuck you, Bruce.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.537
Boom! Perfect!

04:05.245 --> 04:08.614
<i>Mom, can we keep her?</i>

04:08.616 --> 04:13.986
<i>I don't know,
E. It's just one more thing to worry about.</i>

04:35.775 --> 04:38.043
E.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.912
E, wake up.
You're having a nightmare.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.016
What is it baby?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.984
You have another bad dream?

04:45.986 --> 04:47.386
Come here.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.794
We were walking down the
street to go see Dad

04:55.796 --> 04:58.530
and you were listening
to your headphones...

04:58.532 --> 04:59.898
It's okay, take a deep breath.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.000
Tell me.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.903
I was trying to tell you,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.639
but you wouldn't listen to me.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.609
You couldn't hear me 'cause you
were listening to your headphones.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.447
And there were all these cars.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.483
And then I got trapped,
and I couldn't grab you.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.956
And then the car just hit you.
You were dead.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.659
That will never happen.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.529
How do you know?

05:31.798 --> 05:32.964
'Cause I don't have an iPod.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.101
Oh, funny, Mom.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.604
It will never happen because
I would never let it happen.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.975
Okay?
Go to sleep, Mommy's here.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.912
I'll stay with you till
you fall asleep, okay?

05:55.421 --> 05:56.588
<i>Rise and shine, beautiful.</i>

05:58.558 --> 06:00.392
Thought I was gonna
have to wake you up.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.594
No, I don't want to get up.
Come back to bed.

06:03.596 --> 06:04.863
I wish.

06:08.968 --> 06:10.469
Hey, Bingo.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.571
Only school buses
allowed here, Lady.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.508
Since when?
You must not be reading your emails.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.177
Mom!
It's okay, E.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.646
Um, is Frank here?
Frank always lets me double park.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.747
I'm sorry.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.683
What's it say, Mom?

06:59.986 --> 07:00.986
It says we have to park.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.823
Come on, Come on.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.161
Susan, what is this?

07:09.163 --> 07:11.496
Oh, it's to check
the parent IDs.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.166
They sent them in the mail.
Part of that whole new security thing?

07:14.168 --> 07:15.734
I don't... Don't worry.
I'll vouch for you.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.136
Okay, thank you.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.573
ID?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.675
I had a crazy morning.
I forgot it.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.143
I will bring it tomorrow,
I promise.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.145
Parent IDs are mandatory now.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.648
We mailed them out last
week and sent an email.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.450
I'll vouch for her.
Thank you.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.519
Mom?
It's okay, E.

07:34.521 --> 07:37.055
I've been walking him
to class for two years,

07:37.057 --> 07:38.990
surely you can make
an exception for one day.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.892
If I make an exception
for you, Mrs. Brooks.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.994
Then I'm gonna have to
make one for everyone.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.964
Is that how we want to teach our children?
I wouldn't think so.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.799
At this point in the year,

07:47.801 --> 07:50.001
Eli is familiar enough to
get to his own classroom.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.603
He'll be fine.
I'll take Janey?

07:52.605 --> 07:53.839
Okay.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.140
I'm okay, Mom.
Are you sure?

07:56.909 --> 07:57.909
Wait, Janey, give me a kiss!

08:00.513 --> 08:02.214
Bye, baby.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.149
Ooh.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.550
I'll see you later!

08:16.562 --> 08:18.830
...teach my kids,
you fucking bitch.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.165
"Is that how you want
to raise your kids?"

08:20.167 --> 08:22.234
Yeah, that's how I
want to raise my kids.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.202
Thanks for the help,
you fucking condescending...

08:42.554 --> 08:43.621
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.792
I'm gonna take a shower.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.860
Mmm-mmm.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.229
Mmm-mmm.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.730
It's early, stay with me.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.032
No, I've got
to pick up the kids.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.166
Nah!

09:30.836 --> 09:32.804
Oh, God. I love you.

09:32.806 --> 09:33.939
No, you don't.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.340
What?

09:35.342 --> 09:36.342
Why do you say that?

09:37.910 --> 09:40.178
Because you're married.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.748
And because no man can love a
girl whose ass he just fucked.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.116
Jesus, Laney.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.118
You're crazy, you know that?

09:49.989 --> 09:52.924
I told you I'd leave Sue soon.
I love you.

09:57.663 --> 10:00.065
That's what's so funny.
You could love me, fine.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.734
I could love you. It doesn't matter.
It means nothing.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.185
Fuck. Fuck!

11:17.411 --> 11:20.445
You can't park here, ma'am.
We've been all through this, haven't we?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.213
I was hoping you
wouldn't remember.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.049
No, I remember.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.316
Hey, Laney!

11:25.318 --> 11:27.185
Oh.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.054
Hey! Is everything okay?

11:29.056 --> 11:31.056
Did Henry have a bad day?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.824
No, I can't find Donny.
His cell phone has been off all day.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.060
He hasn't been to the office.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.828
I'm sure he's in
a meeting or something.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.197
Lady, you gotta move it!
I'm moving!

11:39.199 --> 11:41.866
Look, I'm sure,
I'm sure Donny is fine.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.334
All right, thank you.
I'll call you later.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.437
Okay, thanks.
Okay.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.305
Oh! Those are my kids!
Those are my kids!

11:47.307 --> 11:48.707
Hurry, kids.
Kids, get in the car!

11:54.914 --> 11:57.215
How was your day?
Good! How was yours?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.984
It was good.
How about you, E?

12:02.121 --> 12:03.421
E, how was your day?

12:03.423 --> 12:04.956
It was fine.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.761
Mommy, your phone!

12:09.763 --> 12:10.763
I know, Sweetie.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.942
Did you miss me?
Yes.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.377
Did you cry?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.279
How much do you love me?

12:28.281 --> 12:32.050
Oh, good! Oh, good,
oh, good, oh, good.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.485
Promise you'll never leave me.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.220
Mommy, stop!

12:36.956 --> 12:39.524
- I'm teasing, muffin!
- I'm just teasing.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.265
Why aren't you eating?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.000
Not hungry.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.270
You need to eat more food.
Real food. Not lollipops.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.540
Jesus, what are you,
the food police?

12:59.078 --> 13:01.346
All that sugar
isn't good for you.

13:01.348 --> 13:05.416
Empty calories, right guys?
Not...

13:05.418 --> 13:08.186
Energy food. That's right!
Energy food.

13:08.188 --> 13:12.257
And I know, if you eat too much sugar,
you can, um...

13:12.259 --> 13:15.193
You can be very
tired and it can...

13:15.195 --> 13:18.029
It can wear down your body.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.998
That's right.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.232
And you'll lose
some of your energy.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.811
Mmm!

13:46.025 --> 13:50.461
Did you that the pilgrims actually stole
America from the Native Americans?

13:50.463 --> 13:54.165
They had the Native Americans teach
them how to grow corn and stuff.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.934
And then they stole their land.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.135
Is that, right?

13:57.137 --> 13:58.970
Yeah, so we gave them casinos.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.573
Mrs. Zeldis told you this?

14:01.575 --> 14:03.508
No, John Frye did.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.845
His mom told him.
She also said Thanksgiving is a lie.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.182
John Frye's mother is a pig.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.350
Lane.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.191
All right.
You kids want to play basketball?

14:21.193 --> 14:23.094
Really?
Yeah!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.562
As long as you promise to
take it easy on me. Let's go.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.597
Okay!
All right.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.160
That's good.
Yes!

14:59.431 --> 15:00.531
Yeah!

15:00.533 --> 15:02.066
That was high.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.038
Eli, soap.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.074
I already did.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.342
Oh, you did?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.986
Did you practice piano today?

15:27.159 --> 15:30.461
E, you've got a piano recital coming up.
Did you practice?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.363
Yeah.
How much?

15:41.641 --> 15:43.608
You done? All set?

15:45.344 --> 15:46.511
Mmm-hmm.
Great.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.518
Whoa-oh!

15:58.457 --> 16:00.291
Mom?

16:01.293 --> 16:02.593
I can't breathe.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.642
E, put on your T-shirt.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.045
Ooh, dry your balls.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.648
Mom!

16:23.650 --> 16:25.016
You'll get a rash.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.069
What's up?

16:46.105 --> 16:48.039
I'm just thinking.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.741
About?

16:49.743 --> 16:51.676
Your balls.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.277
What?
Your balls!

16:53.279 --> 16:55.680
Like do you worry
about drying them?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.081
Do I worry?

16:59.151 --> 17:01.219
Like when you were a little boy,
did your mother

17:01.221 --> 17:02.487
teach you how to dry your balls,

17:02.489 --> 17:03.688
or you just knew instinctively?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.290
Like should I be teaching Eli?

17:06.291 --> 17:08.459
Honey, you dry them like any
other part of your body.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.396
Oh.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.664
But if you don't dry it,
could you get a rash?

17:15.768 --> 17:18.169
I guess you could,
but whatever you don't get

17:18.171 --> 17:19.436
will just dry in your underwear.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.105
What's going on, Laney?

17:21.107 --> 17:24.342
Oh, your underwear!

17:24.344 --> 17:27.078
Of course,
I don't know why I didn't think of that.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.680
You know,
all this talk about balls...

17:37.790 --> 17:39.323
You're so beautiful.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.749
I feel like my dad
dried and powdered.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.652
Christ, Laney,
can we change the subject?

18:19.465 --> 18:21.566
We got to get rid of Bingo.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.575
I'm serious.
We can't keep him.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.846
It's just a dog, Laney.
All kids get a dog.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.514
Why does it have to
be such a big deal?

18:36.516 --> 18:39.650
Why does everything
have to be such a big deal?

18:39.652 --> 18:42.453
Because dogs get old and die!

18:42.455 --> 18:44.255
I mean, what does
a dog live? Ten years?

18:44.257 --> 18:48.693
Yes. Ten enjoyable years
our kids can have a dog.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.295
Only you could manage to turn getting
a dog into a fucking negative.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.632
I'm trying to spare
them a negative!

18:54.634 --> 18:59.270
This dog is going to die,
and our kids will be heartbroken.

19:00.339 --> 19:01.606
Yeah, but that's life, Lane.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.374
That's how it works.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.243
Dogs die. Bingo will die too.
The kids can handle it.

19:06.545 --> 19:07.912
I can't handle it.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.751
Well, then why bother
loving anything, hmm?

19:13.753 --> 19:14.852
I mean, why bother loving me?

19:18.924 --> 19:23.895
Yeah, yeah. I don't see why
anybody bothers loving anything.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.530
Oh, come on, Lane.
You don't mean that.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.931
I do mean that.

19:29.468 --> 19:30.935
So what do you suggest?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.774
Don't fall in love.

19:36.776 --> 19:37.842
Don't...

19:40.345 --> 19:43.948
Don't get married.
Don't have kids.

19:43.950 --> 19:48.586
Don't act like everything's gonna be okay,
when nothing's gonna be okay.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.791
Well, thankfully most of us
like to keep fooling ourselves.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.262
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

19:59.298 --> 20:00.898
Why wouldn't I be okay?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.401
I don't know.
I just worry about you, that's all.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.369
I got to go check on the kids.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.448
<i>Hello?</i>

20:50.450 --> 20:53.251
Hi, is this Diane?
<i>Yes.</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:57.321
I'm so sorry to call so late.
This is Laney Brooks, I'm Eli's mom.

21:00.525 --> 21:05.263
Fine. Actually, I'm not,
that's funny, I'm not fine. I...

21:05.265 --> 21:07.999
Eli came home from school
today with a bunch of stories

21:08.001 --> 21:10.868
about how the Pilgrims
were thieves,

21:10.870 --> 21:15.673
and Thanksgiving
is a lie, and I...

21:15.675 --> 21:18.843
Well, that's fine, I...
Well, you...

21:18.845 --> 21:23.347
Yes, you can teach your kids
anything you want, I just would.

21:23.349 --> 21:28.819
I'm trying to teach my son, uh,
to have gratitude and Thanksgiving...

21:31.323 --> 21:36.327
Okay, now, I didn't call to get into
a debate with you, Diane, I just...

21:37.329 --> 21:38.629
Mmm-hmm.

21:38.631 --> 21:42.066
That's fine.
Yeah, no, no, no.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.035
How about this,
why don't you go fuck yourself?

21:44.037 --> 21:45.636
And you can tell
your little brat

21:45.638 --> 21:47.004
to stay the fuck
away from my kid.

26:22.781 --> 26:23.847
Help.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.125
Bruce.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.230
Laney?

26:40.232 --> 26:42.132
Are you okay?

26:42.134 --> 26:44.001
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.136
Oh, Jesus, Laney.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.905
What did you do?
What did you do?

27:23.108 --> 27:25.709
I don't think I can do this.

27:25.711 --> 27:28.245
It's just a month, Laney.
You'll be home before you know it.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.683
You must be Laney.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.387
Okay. You can keep these.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.990
And you can keep that.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.229
And I need your bra too, honey.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.033
Jesus.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.401
I suggest you try
and get some sleep.

27:50.403 --> 27:52.302
Drink as much water as you can.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.837
We'll check on you
through the night

27:53.839 --> 27:55.973
just to make sure
everything's okay.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.107
Questions?

27:57.109 --> 27:59.777
I need to call my husband.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.211
We'll give him regular updates.

28:03.682 --> 28:07.017
Everybody's anxious
their first time, honey.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.254
You're gonna do great.
I'll check on you later.

28:24.803 --> 28:27.171
<i>When did you
start hating me, Lane?</i>

28:27.173 --> 28:29.239
I don't hate you, Bruce.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.075
Then why did you
stop taking your meds?

28:33.178 --> 28:34.478
<i>They were making me fat.</i>

28:34.480 --> 28:36.180
<i>That's bullshit.
It's true.</i>

28:36.182 --> 28:38.248
So, what,
you'd rather be insane?

28:42.087 --> 28:44.722
<i>You promised me
you'd take your medication.</i>

28:44.724 --> 28:46.890
If not for me,
then for the kids.

28:46.892 --> 28:47.958
They're gonna start to notice.

28:53.965 --> 28:57.267
I need to call my husband.
There's been a mistake.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.170
It's honestly just
not the place for me.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.272
Your doctor will help you with
that when you see him, honey.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.974
Okay,
well then I'd like to see the doctor now.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.242
You know,
the first 48 hours are the worst.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.744
Well, is this
a fucking hospital?

29:06.746 --> 29:08.045
'Cause I'd like to
see the doctor now.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.047
This is a fucking
hospital right?

29:10.049 --> 29:12.049
Relax, relax. You need to get
some rest. This is the worst...

29:12.051 --> 29:13.951
Don't fucking touch me!
You're gonna feel better soon.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.094
<i>I just want you to be happy,
Laney, like you used to be.</i>

29:28.133 --> 29:30.000
<i>Don't you want to be happy?</i>

29:34.539 --> 29:36.907
Okay, your blood work shows

29:38.309 --> 29:42.513
cocaine, amphetamines,
Ambien and marijuana,

29:42.515 --> 29:45.849
but there's no trace of lithium.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.118
Do you want to tell me why you
stopped taking the lithium?

29:57.562 --> 29:59.863
Nurse Pauline says that
you're desperate to go home,

29:59.865 --> 30:02.266
and that you feel
you don't belong here.

30:02.268 --> 30:03.534
I don't.

30:05.436 --> 30:08.338
Well then, why are you staying?

30:11.976 --> 30:13.410
Call someone and go.
You're an adult.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.347
Why not?

30:17.349 --> 30:20.217
Because I have a family.
So?

30:20.219 --> 30:22.519
So, I can't just go home

30:24.556 --> 30:26.423
and do this again.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.464
So, uh, where would
you like to start?

30:35.567 --> 30:37.568
Really?

30:37.570 --> 30:39.503
Really.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.141
What's more interesting for you,

30:44.143 --> 30:47.344
the daddy issues or the drugs?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.613
Well, uh, I'd like to start
with the daddy issues

30:49.615 --> 30:53.016
because it's a very organic
segue into the drugs.

30:56.487 --> 31:01.091
Well, mine's boring.
My dad left when I was nine.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.060
That's the whole story.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.929
He kissed me goodnight,
and that's the last time I saw him.

31:06.931 --> 31:09.266
So, drugs?

31:09.268 --> 31:11.635
Yeah, we'll get to that.

31:11.637 --> 31:14.571
Can you tell me why you
haven't spoken again?

31:14.573 --> 31:16.974
Um, he didn't call me.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.009
Why didn't you call him?

31:19.011 --> 31:22.145
Because I didn't
know where he lived.

31:23.147 --> 31:24.214
Ah.

31:28.887 --> 31:33.123
He's upstate.
My brother told me.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.225
So, your brother talks to him?
He does.

31:36.327 --> 31:40.030
Or he did. I don't know.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.367
We um, we don't talk about
Dad anymore because, um,

31:43.369 --> 31:45.435
it always ends up in a fight.

31:49.173 --> 31:52.910
When he left my mother,
she was devastated.

31:52.912 --> 31:57.114
So, I... I held onto that.

31:57.116 --> 32:00.450
And he

32:00.452 --> 32:03.186
didn't, I guess.

32:03.188 --> 32:05.088
Did she remarry?
Mmm-hmm.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.959
Yeah, a few years later.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.961
Why didn't you call him then?

32:10.963 --> 32:14.665
Why don't you ask him
why he didn't call me?

32:14.667 --> 32:16.133
Why do you think
he didn't call you?

32:30.982 --> 32:32.983
Can we talk about the drugs now?

32:43.728 --> 32:45.162
<i>Hello?
Hi!</i>

32:45.164 --> 32:47.197
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

32:47.199 --> 32:50.534
Good! It's going...
It's going well.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.436
How are you?
<i>Good.</i>

32:52.438 --> 32:55.439
<i>The kids are wiped out.
Getting ready for bed.</i>

32:55.441 --> 32:56.740
<i>It was a big day ice skating.</i>

32:56.742 --> 32:58.742
You went ice skating,
without me?

32:58.744 --> 33:00.077
<i>Laney, I...</i>

33:00.079 --> 33:02.546
I just... It's just...

33:02.548 --> 33:06.149
We always go together, I mean,
it's kind of our thing.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.452
<i>Yeah, I know, Laney.
But you're not here.</i>

33:08.454 --> 33:10.654
<i>Would you rather
I didn't take them?</i>

33:10.656 --> 33:12.589
No.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.424
No, I just...
I should've been there.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.326
<i>I know, and you'll
take them next year.</i>

33:19.364 --> 33:21.999
<i>Just focus on getting better,
the kids need you. I need you.</i>

33:24.469 --> 33:26.303
<i>I'm sorry. I got to go.</i>

33:26.305 --> 33:27.738
Can I say
good night to the kids?

33:27.740 --> 33:30.741
<i>I don't want to
upset them before bed.</i>

33:30.743 --> 33:32.442
<i>We'll see you at
the family visit.</i>

33:32.444 --> 33:34.344
<i>I'm sorry, Laney, I...</i>

33:34.346 --> 33:37.214
<i>I have to go. I love you.
We all love you.</i>

33:37.216 --> 33:38.216
<i>We miss you here.</i>

33:38.217 --> 33:39.750
I love you too.

33:58.436 --> 34:01.338
You look good.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.340
Feeling better?

34:02.341 --> 34:04.374
I am.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.210
You seem like
you're making progress.

34:09.347 --> 34:11.581
Yeah.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.317
Why don't you say what you're
really thinking, Bruce?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.353
What?
I don't understand why you're so angry.

34:16.355 --> 34:19.755
I'm not...

34:19.757 --> 34:25.195
What? I'm not angry!
I'm not angry. I'm scared.

34:25.197 --> 34:29.565
What are you scared of?
Everything!

34:29.568 --> 34:32.803
I know you think that if I
take my medication every day,

34:32.804 --> 34:34.371
that everything
will go back to normal.

34:34.373 --> 34:37.440
But it's bigger than that.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.483
What is Eli doing with his eyes?

34:46.485 --> 34:47.851
Have you noticed that?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.152
No.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.791
Is he doing that at school?

34:54.793 --> 34:56.592
I don't know.
No one's called me about it.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.329
You can't wait for someone to
call you about it!

34:59.331 --> 35:02.132
You have to call them. Kids
could be making fun of him.

35:02.134 --> 35:05.202
You've got to call the teacher on Monday.
First thing. You've got to...

35:05.204 --> 35:06.603
Promise me you'll call
the teacher on Monday.

35:06.605 --> 35:10.240
I promise, Laney.
I'll make sure he's okay.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.342
Don't worry about it.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.518
I need to tell you some things.

35:23.488 --> 35:26.723
Some

35:26.725 --> 35:29.759
really fucked up things I did
when I wasn't thinking clearly

35:29.761 --> 35:32.362
and I want you to know them.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.597
So we can start fresh.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.332
I don't want
to do this now, Laney.

35:35.334 --> 35:38.168
It's important for me,
that I, that I... I need to...

35:38.170 --> 35:39.703
Come on kids. That's enough.
Let's go. Sit down.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.742
How many cupcakes did you eat?
One.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.410
One? Liar.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.479
She ate two.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.420
Okay.
Bye, Mommy!

35:57.422 --> 36:01.892
Bye, baby!
Oh, it's so good to see you!

36:01.894 --> 36:03.860
It's so good to see you.

36:07.465 --> 36:09.733
I brought you something.
You did?

36:13.671 --> 36:14.704
I made this for you.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.908
Dream catcher!

36:17.910 --> 36:20.343
No more bad dreams.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.947
Thank you. E, thank you. I love it.
I love it. It's beautiful.

36:48.239 --> 36:51.575
<i>Neither of them
will ever know how hard</i>

36:51.577 --> 36:53.877
I tried to not hurt them.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.516
Am I gonna fuck this up?

36:59.518 --> 37:01.751
I don't want to fuck this up.
I don't want to fuck this up.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.954
Well, you're gonna
fuck up sometimes.

37:03.956 --> 37:06.289
You're gonna say things
that you regret,

37:06.291 --> 37:08.291
you're gonna do things
that you're not proud of,

37:08.293 --> 37:11.294
and then you're gonna remember
that you're a human being.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.430
We all have our moments.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.799
But when you came here,
you made a conscious decision.

37:17.301 --> 37:18.768
And that was to live.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.778
<i>Nobody tells you
that it's terrifying,</i>

37:28.780 --> 37:30.380
<i>you know,
to love something so much.</i>

37:31.382 --> 37:33.283
Well, yeah.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.485
You're going to have to find
a way to face your terror.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.922
And, uh, you're going to have
to decide what it is you want.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.258
Right.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.327
What do you want?

37:50.835 --> 37:53.670
<i>I've made really shitty
decisions my whole life.</i>

37:53.672 --> 37:56.339
<i>And I just...</i>

37:56.341 --> 37:59.309
<i>I need to remember
how to be a good wife,</i>

37:59.311 --> 38:03.380
<i>and a good mother,
and a real person.</i>

38:03.382 --> 38:05.515
I want to smile like
I did the first time

38:05.517 --> 38:07.951
I saw Janey walk across a room.

38:10.354 --> 38:13.957
I'd love to smile like
that again. You know?

38:21.032 --> 38:24.301
It might not happen right away.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.435
You might have
to wait for a bit.

38:28.606 --> 38:32.676
Look, everything beautiful,
every moment of beauty,

38:32.678 --> 38:35.345
it goes away. Fades.

38:35.347 --> 38:38.715
But then there's another one,

38:38.717 --> 38:40.417
and another one,
and another one.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.021
And you just have to
be alive to see it.

38:50.061 --> 38:53.596
Keep taking your meds.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.365
Have faith in yourself.

39:29.433 --> 39:30.900
Eli, you want to
help us ice the cake?

39:32.636 --> 39:34.637
No, thanks.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.906
It's not the way I pictured it.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.409
It's not perfect.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.812
What? It is perfect.
What are you talking about?

39:42.814 --> 39:46.149
I don't know why you're crying.
This cake is beautiful.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.417
Isn't it, E?

39:47.419 --> 39:48.419
I like it.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.786
See?

39:49.788 --> 39:52.956
All right, basement's dry.
What's going on?

39:52.958 --> 39:55.024
She doesn't like her cake.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.626
What? Janey,
that's a great cake!

39:56.628 --> 39:58.428
That's the best cake
I've ever seen.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.463
Really?
Really.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.998
Hey, can I smell it?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.032
Does it smell as
good as it looks?

40:03.034 --> 40:05.034
Okay.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.803
Mmm

40:06.805 --> 40:08.838
Daddy!
Yeah, that smells good.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.939
Your nose!
What?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.641
Your nose!
What?

40:11.643 --> 40:13.143
What's wrong with my nose?

40:13.145 --> 40:14.778
You have something on your nose.
What?

40:14.780 --> 40:16.880
I don't see anything.
Your nose!

40:16.882 --> 40:17.914
Right there.
What?

40:17.916 --> 40:21.050
I want to smell it!
Okay!

40:21.052 --> 40:23.787
Oh, my gosh!
You got a little something.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.688
What?
Just a little...

40:25.690 --> 40:26.990
Smell it, Mommy!
I'm want to smell it. Can I smell it?

40:28.192 --> 40:30.627
Oh, my gosh!

40:30.629 --> 40:32.996
That's the best smelling cake
I've ever smelled.

40:34.799 --> 40:35.932
Come on, E.
You want to smell it?

40:38.969 --> 40:40.970
- What?
- Mommy!

40:40.972 --> 40:42.972
- Oh, it's all right, muffin.
- It's just the electricity.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.474
It'll come back
in a few minutes.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.512
Janey, look at this.

40:49.514 --> 40:53.049
This one is just for you.

41:57.147 --> 42:00.083
Are you kidding me?
You can do better than that.

42:00.085 --> 42:02.585
<i>What concerns me
are the rituals.</i>

42:02.587 --> 42:06.155
The eye blinking,
the constant pencil sharpening.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.957
Recently,
he started a pattern with tapping his feet.

42:09.026 --> 42:11.728
These behaviors suggest anxiety.

42:11.730 --> 42:14.097
The rituals are a way for
Eli to stay in control.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.300
It's not unusual,

42:17.302 --> 42:18.868
but the rituals
can become a problem

42:18.870 --> 42:20.203
when they get in
the way of functioning.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.105
When they become all consuming.

42:23.107 --> 42:24.841
So, what do we do?

42:24.843 --> 42:27.577
In my opinion, Eli
needs to see a specialist.

42:27.579 --> 42:29.846
Perhaps start with cognitive
behavioral therapy.

42:29.848 --> 42:31.147
Or, perhaps, he can even
benefit from medication.

42:32.149 --> 42:34.918
Medication?

42:34.920 --> 42:37.320
It's my fault.
He's got my genes.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.322
Stop it.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.836
Did you go to rehab because
you're a drug addict?

42:57.207 --> 43:00.777
No. Why...
Why would you think that?

43:00.779 --> 43:02.912
John Frye said
you're a drug addict?

43:02.914 --> 43:04.714
Mommy, drugs are bad.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.649
That's not why she was there, E.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.985
John Frye is just
trying to get your goat.

43:09.987 --> 43:13.056
Eli doesn't have a goat.

43:13.058 --> 43:15.224
Then why were you there?

43:19.997 --> 43:23.099
I was having some
problems in my mind.

43:25.970 --> 43:29.372
And they were making me do
things I shouldn't have done.

43:31.742 --> 43:34.177
Then why did you do them?

43:34.179 --> 43:36.179
Well, it's complicated.
But, um,

43:37.181 --> 43:38.881
but I saw a doctor

43:38.883 --> 43:42.218
who was really, really smart.

43:42.220 --> 43:45.688
And he helped me sort
through my problems.

43:49.059 --> 43:50.860
And now I'm better.

43:54.331 --> 43:58.768
Did Mr. Odesky tell you
to send me to rehab too?

43:59.970 --> 44:03.306
No. No, no, no.

44:25.996 --> 44:27.930
Mom, look at this one.
It's so cool.

44:27.932 --> 44:29.899
Really cool.

44:29.901 --> 44:33.002
Eli!
Hey, Henry!

44:33.004 --> 44:35.772
Hey, look who it is.
Hey.

44:36.774 --> 44:39.242
Hi, Donny. Hi, Henry.

44:39.244 --> 44:42.679
Hey, it's good to see you back.

44:42.681 --> 44:45.048
Oh, it's good to be...
It's good to be back.

44:45.050 --> 44:47.050
Which one are you getting?

44:47.052 --> 44:48.885
I have to see what I can afford.

44:48.887 --> 44:50.953
I'd get a superhero
if I were you, Eli.

44:50.955 --> 44:53.389
Now,
I don't know about you guys,

44:53.391 --> 44:55.358
but I have always wanted
to be the kind of superhero

44:55.360 --> 44:57.694
that swoops into
the burning building

44:57.696 --> 45:01.064
and then rescues the woman
and flies her off to safety.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.232
Well,
you can't be Batman 'cause he doesn't fly.

45:03.234 --> 45:05.068
Right.

45:05.070 --> 45:07.470
And Spider-Man doesn't really fly.
He swings.

45:07.472 --> 45:10.206
Well, what do you guys
think about Superman?

45:10.208 --> 45:11.874
What do you think, Laney?
I think I could be a good Superman.

45:13.310 --> 45:16.713
I think you're
already a superhero, Donny.

45:16.715 --> 45:20.316
Laney! It's so good to see you.
I've missed you.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.351
I...

45:22.353 --> 45:26.255
I didn't know that
you were pregnant.

45:26.257 --> 45:28.291
You're glowing!

45:28.293 --> 45:30.026
Oh, bullshit. I look like shit.
I feel like shit.

45:30.028 --> 45:32.361
But I'm almost halfway through,
thankfully.

45:32.363 --> 45:35.264
Oh, my gosh!
Congratulations!

45:35.266 --> 45:38.134
Thanks. Hey, did you get my
message about my birthday party?

45:38.136 --> 45:40.236
I did. I'm sorry, I did.

45:40.238 --> 45:43.406
It's fine, I just want to make sure
you know, no pressure, really.

45:43.408 --> 45:45.742
I totally understand
if you'd rather skip it.

45:45.744 --> 45:47.810
We're gonna be there.
We're planning on it. Okay.

45:47.812 --> 45:49.445
Can I get this one, Mom?
Yes.

45:49.447 --> 45:52.181
Oh, hey, good choice, my man.

45:52.183 --> 45:55.752
Um, we've got to go.
So, we'll see you next weekend!

45:55.754 --> 45:57.220
Yeah! We'll see you soon.
Bye, Henry.

46:25.415 --> 46:27.083
Oh, my big girl.

46:35.526 --> 46:37.460
I have a wish.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.095
You do?
What's your wish, baby?

46:39.097 --> 46:41.264
I can't tell you.

46:41.266 --> 46:42.465
Why can't you tell me?

46:42.467 --> 46:44.467
Because it won't come true.

46:45.569 --> 46:47.503
Who told you that?

46:47.505 --> 46:49.505
I don't remember.

46:49.507 --> 46:53.042
Well, whoever told you doesn't
know about the "mommy clause."

46:53.044 --> 46:55.945
You can always
tell Mommy your wish.

46:57.414 --> 46:59.849
I wish you'll love me forever.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.419
You don't have to
worry about that, baby.

47:03.421 --> 47:05.421
I will always love you.

47:05.423 --> 47:07.356
Forever?
Forever!

47:18.569 --> 47:20.136
I don't know, I always heard

47:20.138 --> 47:22.138
you're not supposed
to have too much time.

47:22.140 --> 47:23.272
Listen, I cover
all that in the book.

47:23.274 --> 47:25.341
But, to answer your question,

47:25.343 --> 47:28.511
there really is no such thing as
having too much life insurance.

47:28.513 --> 47:30.847
Especially,
if you're planning on having more kids.

47:30.849 --> 47:33.182
No offense, David,
you look like you are in great shape.

47:33.184 --> 47:35.251
Seriously.

47:35.253 --> 47:38.154
But, I'm guessing Katrina
here is going to outlive you.

47:38.156 --> 47:39.522
Yeah. That's the plan

47:39.524 --> 47:41.123
I mean, I plucked her
out of high school.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.892
Stop, I was almost
out of college.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.327
Yeah, the book covers
a lot of unique scenarios.

47:44.329 --> 47:46.195
I see it like this, Dave.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.531
There's a Bible
for the afterlife,

47:48.533 --> 47:49.565
I wrote the Bible
for the here and now.

47:50.601 --> 47:52.969
Yeah. It sounds brilliant.

47:52.971 --> 47:56.439
I mean, especially, that notion of,
uh, hedging your bet against God.

47:56.441 --> 47:59.041
Sure it'll be a bestseller.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.377
You know, I have always
dreamed of writing a book.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.945
But, how did you do it, Bruce?

48:02.947 --> 48:04.447
I mean, did you just sit down

48:04.449 --> 48:06.482
and type everything you were
thinking into a computer?

48:06.484 --> 48:08.951
Or did you pay
someone to help you?

48:08.953 --> 48:11.420
It's sentence by sentence.
Anyone can do it.

48:11.422 --> 48:13.356
Listen, you call me any time,

48:13.358 --> 48:15.524
and I would be
happy to help you.

48:15.526 --> 48:16.926
Thank you.

48:18.295 --> 48:21.197
What do you want to
write a book about?

48:21.199 --> 48:24.200
You know, like,
maybe a children's book?

48:25.202 --> 48:26.903
I'm not sure yet.

48:26.905 --> 48:28.571
I'm thinking
about writing a book.

48:28.573 --> 48:30.006
Really? On what?

48:31.208 --> 48:33.242
Prostitution.

48:33.244 --> 48:34.510
Prostitution?
Come on, honey.

48:34.512 --> 48:36.012
You don't know anything
about prostitution.

48:36.014 --> 48:38.114
It's the ultimate hypocrisy.

48:38.116 --> 48:40.049
It's illegal to sell
your body, right?

48:40.051 --> 48:42.451
But if you're rich enough,
it's perfectly acceptable.

48:42.453 --> 48:44.353
They just call it being a wife.

48:50.194 --> 48:53.429
Sorry.

48:53.431 --> 48:56.632
Uh, I would like to make a toast,
uh, to my beautiful wife.

48:59.269 --> 49:01.070
Thank you.

49:01.072 --> 49:03.940
Thank you for putting up
with the restaurant hours,

49:03.942 --> 49:05.474
and thank you for
putting up with me.

49:05.476 --> 49:07.176
Suz, I just want you to know,

49:07.178 --> 49:11.213
that, uh, every morning
when I drive away to work,

49:11.215 --> 49:14.650
and I see you standing there waving,
with Henry by your side,

49:14.652 --> 49:16.085
the only thing
I'm thinking about

49:16.087 --> 49:18.254
is how fast I can
get back to you.

49:18.256 --> 49:19.256
Happy birthday, honey.

49:32.402 --> 49:34.603
Hey.
Hey.

49:36.340 --> 49:39.442
God, you look amazing.

49:39.444 --> 49:40.977
Do I?
Like a million bucks.

49:42.446 --> 49:43.646
Thank you.

49:47.351 --> 49:50.152
I wanted to...
I was gonna call.

49:50.154 --> 49:52.054
But I figured I had done enough,

49:52.056 --> 49:53.389
that I had done enough damage.

49:53.391 --> 49:56.025
No, you...
It's not your fault.

49:56.027 --> 49:58.160
You could have been any man.

49:58.162 --> 50:00.763
Wow, really.
That came out wrong.

50:00.765 --> 50:02.598
I just meant
it's not your fault,

50:02.600 --> 50:04.100
you didn't drive me to rehab.

50:10.574 --> 50:12.208
I am here for you.

50:13.610 --> 50:16.145
If you need anything,
you just call me, okay?

50:16.147 --> 50:18.114
Thanks.
Thank you, Donny. Yeah.

50:23.553 --> 50:25.521
Not at home.

50:25.523 --> 50:27.556
You can call the restaurant.

50:27.558 --> 50:29.425
If you need anything,
you talk to Jeanine, okay?

50:29.427 --> 50:30.593
I mean, anything at all.

50:32.295 --> 50:33.696
Thank you.

50:45.108 --> 50:46.375
When are you gonna talk to me?

50:49.312 --> 50:50.513
Why would you do that?

50:51.515 --> 50:53.416
Babbling about prostitution?

50:53.418 --> 50:55.384
I was this close to signing
David Blackman as a client.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.787
I know.
Do you?

50:57.789 --> 51:00.256
Do you have any idea how hard
I work to keep this all going?

51:00.258 --> 51:01.791
'Cause you act like
it's some big joke.

51:01.793 --> 51:03.626
Like what I do for a living
is somehow beneath you.

51:06.430 --> 51:07.696
We used to be in this together.
Remember?

51:07.698 --> 51:09.298
We used to be on the same team.

51:09.300 --> 51:12.768
I'm sorry. I said I was sorry.
I am, I mean it.

51:14.604 --> 51:16.672
I know how hard
you work. And I...

51:16.674 --> 51:19.542
I don't know
what I was thinking.

51:19.544 --> 51:24.313
Come here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

51:26.216 --> 51:29.752
She was just, she was such a...
Prostitute?

51:31.155 --> 51:32.155
Yes!

51:45.869 --> 51:47.736
Why don't you come to the
conference with me this weekend?

51:49.673 --> 51:52.274
What if we run into my dad?

51:52.276 --> 51:54.243
We don't ever have
to leave the hotel.

51:56.346 --> 51:58.414
I don't know,
you know how those things are.

51:58.416 --> 52:00.583
It's just people being shitfaced

52:00.585 --> 52:02.751
for three straight days,
and I don't...

52:02.753 --> 52:06.889
Not for us.
Nothing stronger than water for me, either.

52:06.891 --> 52:11.660
Come on, we can lay in bed.
You could get a massage.

52:11.662 --> 52:16.699
What about the kids?
They'll stay with my sister.

52:16.701 --> 52:18.667
They've been
through so much already.

52:18.669 --> 52:23.339
They'll be fine, Lane.
Happy parents make happy kids.

52:23.341 --> 52:25.741
Just think about it, all right?
It's been a long night.

52:40.724 --> 52:42.424
I'll go with you.

52:45.295 --> 52:46.695
Thank you.

52:59.309 --> 53:00.876
I hate Upstate.

53:00.878 --> 53:04.813
You don't hate Upstate,
you just hate your dad.

53:04.815 --> 53:07.316
I think I hate them both.

53:07.318 --> 53:08.751
Can I hate them both?

53:08.753 --> 53:11.487
Yes, you can hate them both.

53:20.263 --> 53:21.897
Rise and shine, beautiful.

53:23.533 --> 53:24.600
No.

53:26.570 --> 53:28.404
Pancakes and coffee.

53:28.406 --> 53:31.440
And bacon?
Of course!

53:31.442 --> 53:33.309
I've got to call housekeeping.
I got to get my dress steamed.

53:33.311 --> 53:34.610
Wait, wait.

53:34.612 --> 53:35.878
Wait one second.

53:38.748 --> 53:40.349
What have you done?

53:49.392 --> 53:52.361
Who would have ever thought you'd
be able to afford this ring?

53:53.897 --> 53:54.997
You did.

53:59.703 --> 54:01.704
Tell me the newsstand story.

54:01.706 --> 54:03.372
And I want a massage.

54:08.311 --> 54:10.679
I forgot how high maintenance you are.
Mmm-hmm.

54:10.681 --> 54:12.915
Okay, the newsstand story.

54:14.017 --> 54:16.485
Once upon a time,

54:18.288 --> 54:20.322
there was this
incredibly good looking kid.

54:20.324 --> 54:22.291
Awkward kid.

54:22.293 --> 54:24.526
Oh, right, I'm sorry,
that was a different story, my bad.

54:24.528 --> 54:27.997
There was this incredibly
awkward kid in Teaneck,

54:27.999 --> 54:31.500
who used to rack magazines at a store
around the corner from his house,

54:31.502 --> 54:33.402
so he could make
some extra bucks.

54:33.404 --> 54:35.871
He was usually bored out of his skull,
but one day,

54:35.873 --> 54:37.640
this knockout walked in.

54:38.642 --> 54:40.776
Long black hair,

54:40.778 --> 54:42.645
and some really incredible...

54:42.647 --> 54:44.580
You know what I'm saying?

54:44.582 --> 54:47.616
There was just
something about this girl.

54:47.618 --> 54:50.486
So this kid,
started dressing up for work.

54:50.488 --> 54:52.521
Bullshit,
he wore a T-shirt.

54:52.523 --> 54:56.825
If you knew how carefully he
selected them for fit and color.

54:56.827 --> 55:01.430
Anyway, the point of the story is
that every day this kid would wait,

55:01.432 --> 55:03.499
wondering when that girl
would come back in.

55:03.501 --> 55:05.334
Mmm.

55:05.336 --> 55:07.469
And then,
one day she came back in

55:07.471 --> 55:09.605
and asked the old man behind the
counter for a pack of smokes.

55:09.607 --> 55:11.540
And, when he turned
around she boosted

55:11.542 --> 55:13.876
a candy bar and
stuck it down her pants.

55:15.412 --> 55:17.413
But before she left,

55:17.415 --> 55:20.916
she turned around
and gave the kid a huge smile.

55:20.918 --> 55:22.551
Blew him away.

55:22.553 --> 55:28.390
He thought,
this chick is hot and crazy.

55:28.392 --> 55:30.459
So he rushed out after her,

55:30.461 --> 55:32.961
desperate to get the nerves up to
talk to her for the first time,

55:32.963 --> 55:35.931
and then she did the thing
that just owned him.

55:35.933 --> 55:39.001
She gave the candy bar to the
homeless guy who lived in the alley.

55:39.003 --> 55:41.470
And right then,
the kid was done.

55:41.472 --> 55:43.772
Whatever it took,
he knew he was gonna marry that girl.

55:44.808 --> 55:45.974
And did he?

55:57.387 --> 55:58.754
I'm gonna go jump in the shower.
I don't want to be late.

56:00.357 --> 56:01.357
Let's fuck first.

56:01.359 --> 56:02.424
Mmm.

56:08.398 --> 56:10.399
You sure you don't
want to come with me?

56:10.401 --> 56:14.403
As much as I love insurance seminars,
I think I might pass.

56:14.405 --> 56:16.138
Funny. All right,
I'm back at 5:00,

56:16.140 --> 56:18.607
cocktails at 6:00,
and the awards at 7:00.

56:18.609 --> 56:19.609
I'll be ready.

56:21.745 --> 56:22.878
Have fun.
Thanks.

57:09.526 --> 57:11.460
Oh, I...

57:11.462 --> 57:12.928
- I think I'm at...
- Daisy...

57:21.104 --> 57:22.704
Elaine?

57:22.706 --> 57:23.806
Hi.

57:25.842 --> 57:27.676
What a... What a surprise.

57:27.678 --> 57:28.811
Um...

57:30.079 --> 57:31.880
Daisy, Daisy.
This is Elaine.

57:32.882 --> 57:34.116
She's, um...

57:36.886 --> 57:38.987
I knew your dad a long time ago.

57:40.957 --> 57:41.957
You can call me, Laney.

57:45.962 --> 57:46.995
Come in, come in!

57:55.939 --> 57:57.706
And this is Daisy's room.

58:07.917 --> 58:09.551
Did you have a dollhouse
when you were little?

58:09.553 --> 58:11.753
I did.
What color?

58:13.056 --> 58:14.556
Yellow with blue shutters.

58:22.832 --> 58:25.200
That's me, that's Mommy,
and that's Daddy.

58:28.805 --> 58:29.872
All right.

58:33.576 --> 58:34.643
Let's snap.

58:35.645 --> 58:36.712
Okay!

58:39.015 --> 58:40.682
Bike helmets, huh?

58:41.684 --> 58:43.085
Yeah, all these laws.

58:43.087 --> 58:47.823
All that P.C. garbage.
Keeping our kids safe.

58:47.825 --> 58:51.627
Helmets, car seats, this, that.

58:51.629 --> 58:53.028
We didn't have any of this stuff

58:53.030 --> 58:56.031
when you were a kid,
and you came through.

58:56.033 --> 58:57.633
You survived just fine.

59:02.705 --> 59:03.772
Um...

59:05.909 --> 59:07.776
I thought...

59:07.778 --> 59:11.680
I thought maybe we would,
uh, come down to the city,

59:11.682 --> 59:14.249
Daisy and me, over the summer.

59:14.251 --> 59:20.989
You know,
maybe meet her niece and nephew?

59:20.991 --> 59:26.094
Janey and Eli are their names.
Janey and Eli, yeah, right.

59:26.096 --> 59:30.232
Uh, I'd like to meet them too.
My grandkids.

59:31.901 --> 59:35.070
And Bruce.

59:36.973 --> 59:40.642
I just, you know, when you're...

59:40.644 --> 59:42.945
When it's the right time.
When you're feeling better.

59:44.180 --> 59:46.915
Who told you?

59:46.917 --> 59:50.652
Your brother calls me from time to time.
He gives me updates.

59:55.625 --> 59:58.193
Why didn't you call me?

59:58.195 --> 01:00:01.063
You were in the hospital.
It didn't seem the right time.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.733
I mean,
the 30 years before that.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.045
She loves that bike.

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:19.281
Gave it to her for
her last birthday.

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:28.790
When I was her age,
all I cared about was baseball.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.760
I'll never forget when
I hit my first homerun.

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:33.028
Pow!

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.063
Brought in three runs.

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:38.100
I was so excited I ran all
the way home from school.

01:00:38.102 --> 01:00:41.703
And, "Ma! Ma! Ma!" I shouted, "Ma!"
I couldn't wait to tell her.

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:44.239
I burst right into her bedroom.
Didn't even knock.

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:47.309
And there she was.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:49.411
Face down on the floor
in a pool of her own vomit.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.786
I never knew that.

01:00:57.788 --> 01:01:00.022
No. You were too young.

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:02.257
I don't think your...
your mother even knew.

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:07.696
I felt calling you was wrong.

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.403
It was too much for me.
The whole family thing.

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:19.141
I wasn't ready.
I just couldn't do it.

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:23.245
This time, Daisy helps me make her
lunch before she goes to school.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:30.252
I never knew that would mean something.
Making lunch.

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:40.195
I have to go.
Can I use your bathroom?

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.463
Yeah, of course.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:08.290
I really could have given you
a ride back to your hotel.

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:10.225
Give us more time to catch up.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.827
Next time.

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:21.470
Bye, Daisy.
It was very nice to meet you.

01:02:21.472 --> 01:02:23.438
Take good care of
your daddy, okay?

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:26.808
Hey. Can I?

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:27.810
Yeah.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.884
I never stopped
thinking of you, Elaine.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.063
Make it work this time.

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.100
Go.

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:27.936
<i>Hi, this is Bruce Brooks.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:29.004
Fuck.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.444
Keep 'em coming.

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:11.079
Not a problem.

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:12.447
Enjoy the company.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.121
Where are you from?

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.959
Minnesota.

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:26.261
Dylan, Prince
or The Replacements?

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.232
I went to the same high
school Dylan went to.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.272
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

01:04:37.274 --> 01:04:38.607
I like crazy.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:41.343
Forget it.

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:45.447
Tell me.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:49.217
Do people tell you, you look like Jesus?
Because you look like Jesus.

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:27.255
Bruce, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:31.359
I fell asleep by the fireplace.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.297
And, um, when I woke up,
it was over.

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:40.168
The ceremony.
And I would have gone over, but I was...

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.938
I was nervous because I didn't
want to disappoint you.

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:47.375
But how was it?
Were you a hit?

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:48.710
I looked for you there, Laney.
You weren't there.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.648
So, now you don't
believe me, is that it?

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.317
Yeah. I don't believe you.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.320
Well, Jesus...
No.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:02.190
Do not try to make me
the bad guy here.

01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:04.392
Saying your lie louder
doesn't make it true.

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:16.438
Okay, okay. Okay.

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:20.108
Listen to me, I...

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.644
I found a couple Xanax in the
bottom of my purse, and...

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:23.678
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.015
Huh?

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:29.117
Why is it so easy for you to look
me in the eyes and lie to me? Why?

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.186
Huh?

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.590
Do you even love me, Laney?
Yes, of course I love you!

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:36.691
It's just not enough, huh?

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:45.433
I'm going to Atlanta,
I've got business there for a few days.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:48.003
I need to clear my head

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:50.271
and figure out
where we go from here.

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:52.173
Well, when are you back?
What about Eli's recital?

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:56.211
I'll be there in time for that.

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:59.047
And they can stay with
my sister until then.

01:06:59.049 --> 01:07:00.482
What, you don't
trust them with me?

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:03.752
No. I don't.

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:09.357
Look, I...

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.126
I think this was my fault.
I shouldn't have brought you up here.

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:14.596
It was too soon.
No, yeah, it was too soon.

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:18.800
I said it was too soon,
and now you're leaving me here.

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:22.070
You always seem to find
your way home eventually.

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.239
I just don't know if I want to
be there this time when you do.

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:17.859
Much has been written
about Beethoven's deafness,

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:20.395
but my favorite
story is this one.

01:08:20.397 --> 01:08:23.231
After the first
performance of <i> The Ninth...</i>

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:26.434
Beethoven just stared
blankly at the orchestra.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:29.837
A thoughtful musician realized that
he couldn't hear the clapping, so...

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.738
Daddy! Daddy!

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:35.410
...he made Beethoven turn
around to face the audience.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:38.279
Bruce, please.
Why don't you sit with your family?

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.814
This isn't Carnegie Hall.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:45.153
It was Beethoven's eyes,
not his ears,

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.223
that conveyed
the symphony's triumph.

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:51.693
And now let's use
our eyes and ears,

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:55.162
while we welcome
Eli Brooks to the stage.

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:58.299
Eli will be performing the
final movement of <i> The Ninth,</i>

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.801
<i>The Ode to Joy.</i>

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.617
Come on, Buddy.

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.529
Why is Mommy crying?

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:37.599
Oh, they're happy tears, baby.

01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:42.370
You were just spectacular.

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:44.672
You were just
so extraordinary, E.

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:48.676
I don't deserve
to be your mother.

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:50.812
All right.
Who wants a snack?

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:54.249
I do!
I do!

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.917
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
See you in a minute.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:06.428
- Mom?
- Mom!

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.632
Laney?
God, I...

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:14.602
I can't find my contact. This is crazy.
Because it's clear. It's...

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:17.438
Hi, Pumpkin.

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.610
Oh.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.687
Oh.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:17.992
Hey.
Hey.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:19.727
I need something to calm down.
What happened?

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.163
Um, I don't want
to talk about it.

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:23.898
I just...
I need something.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.700
Laney, I can't
give you anything.

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:27.402
What kind of person
would that make me?

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:28.736
Donny, this is not
the time to moralize.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:29.804
You were just in rehab.

01:13:29.806 --> 01:13:31.005
And now I'm not.

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.777
So, please...

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.479
It's all going to be okay.

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:39.580
Okay?

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.182
Not for me. No.

01:13:41.184 --> 01:13:43.518
For you though,
you're having a baby!

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.752
We'll figure that out.

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:13.114
Suz, what's up?

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.950
Okay, I'm on my way.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:18.152
Honey, everything's
gonna be okay.

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:20.054
Tell him Daddy's on the way.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:21.589
How many people are you gonna
make everything okay for?

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:24.725
I got to go.

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:26.527
I know. I know.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.222
Beer.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:32.827
No Springsteen on the Jukebox?

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.100
Springsteen fan?

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:43.971
Best musician on the planet.

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:46.007
Put Jersey on the map.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:49.577
Frank Sinatra would probably
argue with that, and Bon Jovi...

01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:50.811
Bon Jovi?

01:15:50.813 --> 01:15:52.613
All he ever wanted
was to be Bruce.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:57.118
We all want to be
something better than we are.

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:00.688
So...

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:04.859
So, what?

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.047
Lick it.
Lick what?

01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:27.315
Lick it. Lick my ass.

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:32.153
I'm not licking
that fucking ass.

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.257
No more, fucker.

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:39.894
I'll tell you when it's no more.

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:43.831
Fuck!

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.032
That hurt?

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:49.203
I didn't even feel it.
I didn't feel it.
