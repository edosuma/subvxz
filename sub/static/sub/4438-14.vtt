WEBVTT

00:03.212 --> 00:04.555
All right, Stan.

00:04.755 --> 00:07.474
Another day,
another random body pain.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.348
Here we go.
(grunting and groaning )

00:10.552 --> 00:12.680
<i>“hm.!</i>

00:12.888 --> 00:13.980
<i>MABEL: Dear Stan,</i>

00:14.181 --> 00:15.148
<i>I needed something
to carry milk in,</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.852
<i>so I used your slippers.
Love, Mabel.</i>

00:18.060 --> 00:19.186
<i>“hm.!</i>

( sloshing )

00:24.525 --> 00:26.072
Ahh.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.997
DIPPER: <i>Dear Stan,
I took these</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.075
<i>to build a planetarium suit
for Soos.</i>

00:33.242 --> 00:34.960
<i>Sorry! Dipper.</i>

00:35.118 --> 00:36.415
<i>“hm.!</i>

00:38.914 --> 00:40.336
Whoa, let's not take this line.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.134
There's an old person in it.
Pshht!

00:42.334 --> 00:43.927
Yeah, he's probably
gonna pay with,

00:44.127 --> 00:46.095
like, pennies
and war bonds.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.764
Hey! For your information,

00:47.923 --> 00:49.596
I was gonna shoplift
most of this!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.894
Security!

00:52.094 --> 00:54.017
Hahh! Smoke bomb!

00:56.473 --> 00:58.020
Aw, seriously?

01:01.228 --> 01:03.071
Ahh. Rough start to a clay,

01:03.272 --> 01:04.524
but it's all
gonna be worth it

01:04.730 --> 01:06.859
when I fix that light bulb.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.785
And we're done.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.238
( All cheering)

01:10.404 --> 01:11.872
Does everyone see this?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.040
<i>This</i> is what a hero
looks like right here.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.042
I thought we were
out of light bulbs.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.374
Oh, we were.
So I invented my own.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.047
It will last a thousand years,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.003
and the light it emits
makes your skin softer.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.129
Oh!

01:23.333 --> 01:25.256
Never have I known
such softness.

01:25.544 --> 01:26.716
Anyway, where were you?

01:29.881 --> 01:32.930
Well, TV, at least you appreciate me.
Give me the good news.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.729
<i>WOMAN: This just in:
The mayor is dead.</i>

01:35.929 --> 01:37.931
<i>What?!
Whoa! What's gain' on?</i>

01:38.140 --> 01:39.767
<i>Raised by bears
in the wilderness,</i>

01:39.975 --> 01:41.977
<i>Mayor Eustace "Huckabone"

01:42.185 --> 01:43.858

<i>possibly starting World War I,</i>

<i>in actual adult prison.</i>

01:51.194 --> 01:53.242
<i>A memorial statue

01:53.447 --> 01:55.870
<i>in the deceased mayor's honor.</i>

01:56.074 --> 01:57.951
<i>( sobbing )</i>

01:58.160 --> 02:01.289
<i>I'm sorry. It's just been so

02:01.496 --> 02:03.419
<i>I'm just so happy!</i>

02:03.624 --> 02:05.547
<i>There will be a Town Hall
meeting this afternoon</i>

02:05.751 --> 02:07.003
<i>to discuss replacing him.</i>

02:07.210 --> 02:08.211
New mayor, huh?

02:08.419 --> 02:11.299
Wonder who it could be...

02:11.506 --> 02:13.634
I ♪

02:29.066 --> 02:31.444
All right, order, everyone!
( banging gavel )

02:31.652 --> 02:33.450
( laughing ) Calm down, now.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.033
We're here to choose a mayor
for the first time in almost a century.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.748
According to
the town charter,

02:39.951 --> 02:43.296
a worthy candidate is defined as
anyone who can cast a shadow,

02:43.497 --> 02:46.250
count to ten, and throw their hat
into the provided ring.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.465
Well, now, I do believe
I fulfill all the requirements.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.675
Wait. Bud Gleeful?
He looks good,

02:54.841 --> 02:56.889
considering we threw
his son in jail.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.220
That was a good day.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.101
Now, folks, I know
our family's had

03:00.305 --> 03:02.399
its fair share of
whoopsie-daisies in the past,

03:02.599 --> 03:05.398
but I'd like to make up
for it by formally announcing

03:05.560 --> 03:08.154
my candidacy for
the mayor of Gravity Falls!

03:08.355 --> 03:09.527
Any questions?

03:09.731 --> 03:13.031
Yes. Are you still in contact
with Little Gideon?

03:13.235 --> 03:15.033
That's a great question!

03:15.237 --> 03:17.331
I'm giving you fifty percent
off a used car.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.831
Fifty percent?
<i>Fifty</i> percent?!

03:21.034 --> 03:23.162
In fact, everyone
look under your seats.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.963
You get half off a used car,

03:25.122 --> 03:27.545
<i>-you</i> get half off a used car...
- Better than cash!

03:27.749 --> 03:31.879
Wow! A colorful piece of paper!
He's got my vote.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.634
Guys, I've got
a really bad feeling

03:33.839 --> 03:35.432
about Bud Gleeful
as mayor.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.134
I don't know, dude,
it's not like we have

03:37.342 --> 03:38.935
a lot of good mayor options.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.809
Everyone in this town
is a tad strange,

03:41.012 --> 03:42.980
except, ironically,
Tad Strange.

03:43.181 --> 03:46.685
Hi, guys. Tad's the name,
and being normal's my game.

03:46.893 --> 03:47.894
Loving you, Tad!

03:48.103 --> 03:49.400
And I love bread.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.565
It's a shame Ford isn't here.

03:51.773 --> 03:52.990
He'd run and win

03:53.191 --> 03:55.785
<i>and</i> be a great mayor.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.408
So, since everyone's happy,

03:57.612 --> 03:58.989
I'll just take
the oath of office now,

03:59.197 --> 04:00.915
sound good? Gavel up.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.993
( All gasp )
Hold it right there, Bud!

04:03.160 --> 04:05.083
I'm taking you on!

04:05.287 --> 04:07.415
Stanford? No offense,

04:07.622 --> 04:09.624
but you're just some
two-bit carnival barker,

04:09.833 --> 04:12.086
and your head is more ears
than face!

04:12.294 --> 04:17.425
Oh, yeah? Well, your face
is more fat than...not fat!

04:17.632 --> 04:18.975
(all gasp)

04:19.176 --> 04:20.223
Oh, snap-

04:20.427 --> 04:21.428
What do you say, folks?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.183
Are we just gonna
let Bud win?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.810
How about a <i>real</i> election?

04:25.015 --> 04:26.517
Get in there, hat!

04:26.683 --> 04:29.482
( Spectators cheering )

04:29.686 --> 04:32.189
Well, looks like we got
some competition here, folks.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.115
Which I'm fine with,
totally fine with.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.570
I was gonna let
bygones be bygones, Stan,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.906
but you just made
a powerful enemy.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.990
I'll win either way,
and when I do,

04:42.199 --> 04:44.952
you might not like the
Gravity Falls you wake up in.

04:46.077 --> 04:46.999
<i>( Both gasp )</i>

04:47.162 --> 04:51.383
ALL: Election! Election!
Election!

04:51.583 --> 04:53.301
Hee hee hee hee!

04:53.502 --> 04:55.550
Let the madness begin!

04:58.173 --> 05:00.426
Grunkle Stan,
what are you doing?!

05:00.634 --> 05:01.681
Running for mayor.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.470
Did I--
Did I not make that clear?

05:03.678 --> 05:06.181
Grunkle Stan, it's not that
we think you can't do it,

05:06.389 --> 05:07.936
it's just...
No, no, it's okay, Mabel.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.893
We don't think you can do it.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.900
Look, kids, the mayor kicking
the bucket got me thinking.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.357
I'm an old man
and I'm not getting any younger.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.444
My dumb brother's research is
probably gonna make him famous,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.575
and what do I have
to show for my life?

05:20.779 --> 05:23.077
Do I really want "crooked grifter"
on my tombstone?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.163
How about "crooked mayor"?

05:25.367 --> 05:27.335
Psst. Mabel, let's talk.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.379
I know Stan isn't
the best candidate--

05:29.579 --> 05:32.002
heck, he's committing
voter fraud right now--

05:33.458 --> 05:35.335
but Bud's definitely
up to something,

05:35.544 --> 05:36.966
and we're the only ones
who can stop him.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.262
You're right, Dipper.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.886
Besides, Stan has
a <i>kind</i> of charisma.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.310
How hard could
getting him elected be?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.773
Spread the word, pig.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.477
All right, everybody,
eyes up here.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.112
Okay, Gravity Falls elections

05:54.312 --> 05:55.484
are based on two events:

05:55.689 --> 05:59.193
the Wednesday Stump Speech,
held on an actual stump,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.987
and the Friday Debate, wherein
townsfolk throw bird seed

06:02.195 --> 06:03.788
at the candidate they like most.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.333
At the end, they release
a Freedom Eagle,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.535
who will fly to the candidate
covered in more seed

06:08.743 --> 06:10.962
and bestow a birdly kiss
upon him,

06:11.121 --> 06:13.965
anointing him mayor.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.001
I couldn't make this up
if I wanted to.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.052
( Phone rings )
Okay, Grunkle Stan,

06:18.253 --> 06:20.347
are you ready for
your first radio interview?

06:20.547 --> 06:21.924
I got my mouth, don't I?

06:22.132 --> 06:24.851
Okay, you're on
with the candidate.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.348
<i>ANNOUNCER:
You're listening to Falls Radio,</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:28.772
<i>24-hour news
and bear rampage alerts.</i>

06:28.972 --> 06:31.566
<i>And now, here's the-T Man!</i>

06:31.766 --> 06:32.938
<i>TOBY: Hello.</i>

06:33.143 --> 06:34.861
<i>Candidate Stan,
first question:</i>

06:35.061 --> 06:37.940
<i>How do you feel
about the American flag?</i>

06:38.148 --> 06:39.400
<i>STAN: Eh. I can
take it or leave it.</i>

06:39.608 --> 06:41.736
<i>Too many stripes.
Next question?</i>

06:41.943 --> 06:43.866
(all grumbling )
I don't know about that.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.869
<i>What would you do
to help educate our kids?</i>

06:47.073 --> 06:48.996
Heh! Simple.
Put 'em on an island

06:49.159 --> 06:50.251
and make 'em
fight for dominance.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.250
<i>STAN:
Also teach kids swears.</i>

06:52.454 --> 06:54.798
<i>That'll bring 'em
into the real world.</i>

06:54.998 --> 06:57.922
<i>What would you do about
the crime in Gravity Falls?</i>

06:58.126 --> 06:59.878
Wait. Do you mean
crime in general,

07:00.045 --> 07:02.423
or just the specific crimes
committed by m--

07:02.631 --> 07:05.009
<i>( dial tone )</i>
Okay, interview's over.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.684
Candy, what's the damage?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.686
Your approval rating
started at zero.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.730
Now it's a number
lower than zero.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.057
You're meme-ing fast,

07:12.265 --> 07:13.892
and none of them are good.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.944
Look, Grunkle Stan,
people are like smell markers,

07:17.145 --> 07:18.818
and you're black licorice.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.148
It's not that
you're unsniffable,

07:20.357 --> 07:23.031
you just need to learn
when to keep the cap on.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.909
From now on, maybe you should
just read our prepared remarks.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.865
Heh heh! Sorry, kids.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.122
I only say words
that come out of my brain.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.954
If my head says, "That lady's
got an ugly baby,"

07:34.120 --> 07:37.374
my mouth says, "Whoa, lady!
You got one ugly baby!"

07:39.209 --> 07:41.758
And he's insisting
on speaking his mind!

07:41.920 --> 07:43.797
So this <i>is</i> an emergency.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.723
The Stump Speech
is in a couple of days,

07:45.882 --> 07:48.806
and if he continues like this,
we'll lose to Bud for sure.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.887
Hmm. It's a shame
there isn't some device

07:51.096 --> 07:53.064
that would allow you to control
someone else.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.561
Oh, wait. Of course.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.850
Yes. There is.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.732
A long time ago
I designed a prototype

07:57.936 --> 07:59.279
for Ronald Reagan's masters.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.651
Just get Stan to wear this,

08:00.855 --> 08:03.529
and you can make him
a literal talking head.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.906
Whoa! This is amazing!

08:06.111 --> 08:07.909
And ethically ambiguous!

08:08.113 --> 08:09.911
As long as you wear
the matching one,

08:10.115 --> 08:11.913
he'll say and do
whatever you want him to.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.209
Thank you, Great Uncle Ford!

08:13.410 --> 08:16.129
Yes, yes. Use it
responsibly and all.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.967
Whoa, thanks for
the slammin' tie, dudes.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.386
These stripes
are so slimming.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.965
You really think this mind
control tie is gonna work?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.766
Flip the switch
and test it out.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.719
Whoa!

08:31.928 --> 08:34.022
BOTH: ♪ Oh oh oh,
I'm a dancing dude ♪

08:34.222 --> 08:37.442
♪ I got the fancy moves
and a bad attitude ♪

08:37.600 --> 08:39.568
Ohh!

08:39.769 --> 08:41.897
Ha! That's amazing!

08:42.105 --> 08:44.198
Guys! Something weird
just happened.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.696
I'm really freaked out!

08:45.900 --> 08:49.746
BOTH: I am Soos-tron.
Watch me eat this pinecone.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.994
Mind control is awesome!

08:52.198 --> 08:53.575
( Panting ) Oh, my gosh!

08:53.783 --> 08:57.083
My life just flashed
before my eyes! Ohh!

08:58.288 --> 09:00.382
Education? Git it!

09:00.582 --> 09:02.425
Prosperity? Git it!

09:02.625 --> 09:04.719
A Gravity Falls
we can be proud of?

09:04.919 --> 09:06.171
Git <i>it!!!</i>

09:08.339 --> 09:10.012
Do I really have
to wear this thing?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.014
It looks like a flag
threw up on me.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.687
Grunkle Stan,
just trust your lucky tie.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.061
BLUBS: And now,
Stanford Pines!

09:17.265 --> 09:19.643
You're on, Grunkle Stan!

09:19.851 --> 09:22.980
Okay, we'll only jump in
if he starts doing badly.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.906
Hiya there! Stan Pines here.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.859
Let's get real. Do you think
the women of Gravity Falls

09:28.068 --> 09:29.695
wear too much makeup?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.621
Jump in! Jump in!

09:31.821 --> 09:34.370
Uhh! Uh,
what I meant to say was,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.201
you ladies all look great.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.002
And have you done something
with your hair?

09:38.161 --> 09:40.459
Girl, you are workin' it!

09:40.663 --> 09:44.384
That is exactly what I needed
to hear right now!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.461
Whew!
BOTH: I'm Stan Pines.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.388
You may know me as that guy
who accidentally let all those bees loose

09:49.589 --> 09:51.591
in that elementary school
a few years back.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.893
But I believe in things.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.472
America. Freedom.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.680
Ameri-Freedom.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.517
Good. He's saying
all the right things.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.105
Like my opponent
pointed out,

10:02.310 --> 10:03.778
I may not have
a pretty face,

10:03.978 --> 10:05.855
but if you want a candidate
that will listen to you,

10:06.064 --> 10:09.318
well, I'm proud
to be <i>all</i> ears.

10:09.484 --> 10:10.906
( Approving chatter )

10:11.111 --> 10:13.864
Now watch me break it <i>down!</i>

10:14.072 --> 10:16.416
<i>( hip-hop instrumental plays )
♪ Oh,</i> yeah <i> ♪</i>

10:18.034 --> 10:20.036
( Ghee Uhh!
r5, applause )

10:20.203 --> 10:21.750
( panting )

10:25.667 --> 10:27.965
Grunkle Stan,
that was amazing!

10:28.169 --> 10:30.012
Yeah! How'd you do it,
Mr. Pines?

10:30.213 --> 10:31.385
Uh, I don't know.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.591
I just opened my mouth
and spoke from the heart.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.643
Or gut. Or something.

10:35.802 --> 10:36.894
What is that sound?

10:37.095 --> 10:39.393
Why are people
jamming their hands together?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.019
It's applause!

10:41.224 --> 10:43.522
Grunkle Stan,
they love you!

10:43.685 --> 10:46.108
They... <i>love</i> me?

10:46.312 --> 10:49.031
CHANTING: Stan! Stan! Stan!

10:50.400 --> 10:53.279
There he is! Mr. Pines,
can we get a picture?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.580
ALL: Yes we Stan!

10:55.780 --> 10:58.784
( No audible dialogue )

11:07.000 --> 11:08.343
Dflggone it!

11:08.543 --> 11:10.966
Gosh heck huckleberry
honeysuckle darn it!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.923
Excuse my language.
I'm so sorry.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.133
Oh, this is bad.
This is real bad.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.719
I need to speak with
my campaign manager.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.931
Please excuse me
for a moment.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.483
Look, I'm sorry
about all this.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.985
This is a minor setback,
but we'll win,

11:26.186 --> 11:27.403
I'm sure of it.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.530
<i>GIDEON: Minor setback?</i>

11:29.731 --> 11:31.529
Minor setback?!

11:31.733 --> 11:33.701
You listen, Daddy,
and you listen good.

11:33.902 --> 11:34.994
Prison is a nightmare!

11:35.195 --> 11:36.947
I eat the same slop every day!

11:37.155 --> 11:39.249
They have no hair products
in here!

11:39.449 --> 11:42.953
I can't sleep because my cellmate
took my pillow for a wife!

11:43.119 --> 11:45.247
You think I've been
having fun in here?!

11:45.455 --> 11:48.959
Hey, best friend! Don't be late for
Friendship Bracelet class!

11:49.125 --> 11:52.504
I have fingerpainting
at the same time!

11:52.712 --> 11:54.840
The mayor dying's
my one ticket out of here,

11:55.048 --> 11:56.971
which is why you're gonna
win this election,

11:57.175 --> 11:59.394
pardon me out of prison, and
we're not gonna let the Pines

11:59.594 --> 12:01.938
Qet in my way again!

12:02.138 --> 12:03.435
But-- but you don't understand.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.519
He's going great in the polls.
It's almost like magic.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.149
Magic, you say.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.198
Well, maybe it's time
we fight fire with fire.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.321
I been saving this
for a long time,

12:14.525 --> 12:16.527
waiting for the right moment.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.830
Boy, now, we discussed this.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.532
No more spooky spells.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.162
Well, Daddy,

12:22.325 --> 12:26.046
maybe you just need to have
more of an open mind.

12:26.204 --> 12:30.425
( Speaking ancient language )

12:30.625 --> 12:33.003
No, boy, not that!

12:33.211 --> 12:35.054
Anything but that!

12:35.255 --> 12:38.099
Aaaaah!!!

12:41.094 --> 12:42.937
( Disco beat plays )
Ooh, it's him!

12:45.974 --> 12:47.942
Lookin' good,
mayor candidate.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.144
Hooeey! It's the guy
I'm gonna vote for!

12:50.353 --> 12:53.027
Lookin' A-OK, Stanford, A-OK.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.825
Tad, that means so much
coming from you.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.402
Hey-o!

12:57.610 --> 12:59.328
ALL: Stan!

12:59.529 --> 13:01.076
Now just the ladies.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.206
WOMEN: Stan!

13:02.407 --> 13:03.875
Now just the ladies my age.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.076
Stan!

13:05.243 --> 13:06.244
Woof! Never mind.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.878
On the house,
Mr. Big Shot.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.667
Now, <i>this</i> I could get used to.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.343
Grunkle Stan,
what's with the outfit?

13:14.544 --> 13:15.887
You're missing
your lucky tie.

13:16.087 --> 13:16.929
Power tie.
Gotta wear it.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.848
Come on,
have you seen the polls?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.925
I could debate naked
and I'd still win.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.886
Huh. Come to think of it...

13:23.094 --> 13:24.721
Ha ha. Seriously, though,

13:24.929 --> 13:27.102
we need you to wear
that suit and tie.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.105
Suit and tie.
Gotta wear it.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.108
Uhh! Why do you kids have to
constantly tell me what to do?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.656
Everyone in this town
is finally showing me respect--

13:34.856 --> 13:36.608
maybe you kids should, too.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.820
Grunkle Stan, we'd respect you
if you took things more seriously.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.450
I am taking this
seriously!

13:41.654 --> 13:42.951
If you haven't noticed,

13:43.156 --> 13:44.032
everything's that's come out
of this golden mouth

13:44.198 --> 13:46.621
has put us on top, with
or without your dumb advice!

13:46.826 --> 13:48.669
Dumb advice?!
Yeah!

13:48.870 --> 13:50.838
Dumb advice.
Dang it, Stan!

13:51.039 --> 13:53.667
Every one of those speeches
we were controlling you!

13:53.875 --> 13:55.343
Dipper!
What?!

13:55.543 --> 13:58.422
This tie is a mind control device
invented by Ford.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.052
If it wasn't for this tie,
you'd be losing!

14:03.051 --> 14:05.019
Well, you can tell
that know-it-all Ford

14:05.219 --> 14:07.893
that he can keep his fancy
light bulbs and magic ties.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.441
I'm gonna win this debate
on my own, without any of you!

14:10.600 --> 14:12.273
Stan, wait! You can't!

14:14.312 --> 14:15.689
Oh, this is bad.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.616
If we want to beat Bud,
we need another candidate, fast.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.238
What we need is
a blank slate,

14:20.401 --> 14:21.994
someone totally suggestible,

14:22.195 --> 14:25.165
an empty piece of clay
we can mold to our whims.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.495
Hey, a little help,
dudes?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.701
I accidentally got my head
stuck in my shirt sleeve.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.413
I guess this is my life now.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.921
Seed here!
Support your favorite candidate

14:36.125 --> 14:38.344
by throwing election seed!

14:38.544 --> 14:40.137
Welcome, all,
to the final debate

14:40.338 --> 14:42.136
in what's sure to be,
on a cosmic scale,

14:42.340 --> 14:44.342
a forgettable blip
in human history.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.645
And here come the three
more popular candidates!

14:47.804 --> 14:50.102
Oh! Hello there, Stanford.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.731
Long time no see.
Hee hee. Whoo-hoo-hoo!

14:53.935 --> 14:57.030
Don't you "tee-hee" me.
I'll debate you into the ground!

14:57.230 --> 15:01.201
Oh, but I have a widdle twick
up my sweevie-weeves.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.862
You're making me very
uncomfortable right now.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.663
ANNOUNCER:
But what's this?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.366
One new candidate
has entered the race!

15:08.574 --> 15:10.121
Wait a minute. <i>What?!</i>

15:12.995 --> 15:14.622
Those backstabbing...

15:14.831 --> 15:17.084
Let the debate begin!

15:17.291 --> 15:18.588
First question:

15:18.793 --> 15:20.966
What's your position on axes?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.514
Wait. I mean...taxes.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.307
Easy. Taxes are the worst.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.260
I propose we stimulate
the economy

15:27.468 --> 15:30.017
by waging wars
on neighboring cities.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.894
We have the cannons.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.226
ALL: Boo!

15:34.434 --> 15:35.902
What? Uh...

15:36.102 --> 15:37.775
I don't know much about taxes,

15:37.979 --> 15:40.402
but I can promise you
a kitten in every pot.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.858
That doesn't make sense, Mabel.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.865
<i>You</i> don't make sense, Dipper!

15:45.069 --> 15:48.573
Fwends. Fwends. Can't you see
what's happening on this stage?

15:48.781 --> 15:51.375
These politicians
are dancing around the issues.

15:51.576 --> 15:56.002
Well, <i>I</i> can <i>sing</i>
round the issues!

15:56.205 --> 15:58.958
♪ Crime is bad,
crime is so, so bad ♪

15:59.167 --> 16:00.965
♪ Vote for Bud and it ain't
gonna be no crime ♪

16:01.169 --> 16:02.967
♪ Crime's bad.
Vote for Bud ♪

16:04.630 --> 16:06.724
You may now
throw your birdseed.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.388
And now
a quick intermission.

16:11.596 --> 16:12.973
We're getting
eaten alive back there.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.185
Since when has Bud
been creepily adorable?

16:16.392 --> 16:18.986
I don't know!
It doesn't make sense!

16:19.187 --> 16:21.940
He's almost acting
just like...like...

16:22.148 --> 16:24.321
GIDEON: Widdle old me.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.079
Aha! Hello there!
Long time no see.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.702
Except in my revenge fantasies

16:30.907 --> 16:32.580
where I see you
on an hourly basis.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.252
Gideon! I knew you were
somehow behind this!

16:35.453 --> 16:36.796
You've been controlling Bud!

16:36.996 --> 16:39.169
And it seems <i>you've</i>
been controlling Stanford!

16:39.373 --> 16:40.875
I have to hand it
to both y'all.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.591
You've gotten much eviler
since I last saw ya.

16:43.794 --> 16:44.841
Daddy.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.593
( Bud making zombie noises )

16:46.797 --> 16:47.764
( whimpering )

16:47.965 --> 16:49.967
MABEL: Let go of us!

16:55.806 --> 16:58.935
Behold your grand view
of the debate!

16:59.143 --> 17:00.645
Once I win this election,

17:00.853 --> 17:03.402
I'll finally rule
this backwoods town!

17:03.606 --> 17:06.450
You'll never get away with this,
you creepy little dork!

17:06.651 --> 17:10.246
Oh, I'd be happy to spare you,
Mabel--if you agree to be mine.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.078
I even made you this wedding
dress in crafts class.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.992
Don't ask what it's made of.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.207
Ew! I'd rather die,
you creep!

17:17.411 --> 17:20.540
Fine! Have it your way.
Once I win,

17:20.748 --> 17:22.625
they'll hit the plunger
for the fireworks display,

17:22.833 --> 17:24.425
finishing the mountain's
construction,

17:24.627 --> 17:26.220
trapping you all inside.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.262
I've been trapped
behind concrete all summer--

17:28.464 --> 17:30.558
now see how you like it!

17:30.758 --> 17:33.978
Say hello to the next
mayor of Gravity Falls, kids!

17:34.178 --> 17:36.556
( Evil laughter )

17:36.722 --> 17:38.190
And that is why, um,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.814
the Statue of Liberty
is our hottest landmark.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.235
ALL: BOO!!!!

17:42.436 --> 17:44.404
Awright, I lied.
She's kind of mannish.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.777
What do you want from me?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.986
( Audience cheering )

17:49.193 --> 17:52.447
Ahh. You're dying out there,
Stan.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.746
Kids, you were right
all along.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.827
I shoulda listened to you
when I had the chance.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.163
MABEL: Help! Help us!
What the--?!

18:00.371 --> 18:02.248
DIPPER: We're tied to
a bunch of fireworks!

18:04.917 --> 18:06.464
( Both scream )

18:07.878 --> 18:08.754
( screaming )

18:08.921 --> 18:10.298
(all gasp)

18:10.506 --> 18:11.473
Kids!

18:12.842 --> 18:13.934
Aah!
Aaah!

18:14.135 --> 18:15.682
Listen, everybody,

18:15.845 --> 18:16.937
this debate is over.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.640
I gotta go save my family!

18:18.848 --> 18:21.351
No, those--those are just
some demolition dummies.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.481
Nothin' to see here.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.645
Can it, Gleeful!

18:24.854 --> 18:26.151
Heeyahhh!

18:26.355 --> 18:28.153
ANNOUNCER:
In a shocking turn of events,

18:28.357 --> 18:30.826
Stan Pines has run to
the aid of two children

18:31.027 --> 18:33.121
who appear to be in danger.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.498
And the crowd is loving it!

18:35.698 --> 18:38.497
No! Stop it!
Thank you, but stop it!

18:38.701 --> 18:40.795
Get back,
you terror birds!

18:43.497 --> 18:44.874
Heeyahh!

18:51.422 --> 18:53.140
BOTH: Grunkle Stan!

18:53.341 --> 18:56.265
Kids! Look, I'm sorry
I was being stubborn.

18:56.469 --> 19:00.019
I guess being the town's hero wasn't
enough-- I wanted to be yours, too.

19:00.222 --> 19:03.522
We're sorry, Grunkle Stan. We should
have supported you, win or lose.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.228
Probably lose.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.154
I can still drop you, you know.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.159
( Crowd cheering )

19:14.195 --> 19:17.950
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, not again!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.706
Time to take care of you
once and for all!

19:20.910 --> 19:22.787
Oh no! We have to
get out of here!

19:22.995 --> 19:24.588
Kids, if I die,

19:24.789 --> 19:27.292
make sure I get
a bigger tombstone than Ford.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.257
( Screaming )

19:37.510 --> 19:39.262
( screaming )

19:41.514 --> 19:43.232
No! No!

19:44.517 --> 19:45.814
Aaaaaah!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.645
( Buzzer sounds )

19:48.729 --> 19:50.777
( squawking )

19:50.981 --> 19:52.654
(all gasp)

20:05.496 --> 20:10.502
CHANTING: Mayor Pines!
Mayor Pines! Mayor Pines!

20:10.710 --> 20:13.088
Well, I guess
we know who won.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.512
ANNOUNCER: This just in:

20:14.714 --> 20:16.967
Stanford Pines loses.

20:17.174 --> 20:17.925
ALL: What?!

20:18.134 --> 20:20.728
Despite winning an overwhelming
95% of the vote,

20:20.928 --> 20:22.896
election officials
had to disqualify him

20:23.097 --> 20:25.395
due to discovery of
an extensive criminal record.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.566
Oh boy.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.144
Stan, what did you do?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.774
What <i>didn't</i> I do?

20:29.979 --> 20:31.151
Crimes include shoplifting,

20:31.355 --> 20:32.732
teaching bears to drive,

20:32.940 --> 20:36.035
a new crime he invented
called "burgle-bezzlement,"

20:36.235 --> 20:37.908
first-degree llamacide...

20:38.112 --> 20:39.910
That llama knew too much.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.286
Due to this shocking
development,

20:41.490 --> 20:43.492
it would appear the mayorship
passes to

20:43.701 --> 20:46.204
the only candidate who actually
filled out their paperwork,

20:46.412 --> 20:49.757
local enthusiasm enthusiast
Tyler Cutebiker.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.754
Got it.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.513
We will dedicate
the rest of this broadcast

20:56.714 --> 20:58.557
to listing Stan's crimes.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.103
First-degree thermometer theft,
pug trafficking--

21:02.303 --> 21:04.397
Whoo! At least they didn't
list any of the bad ones.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.895
On an unrelated topic,
I have a lot of cheap pugs,

21:07.099 --> 21:08.601
and I need to move them fast.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.186
I'm sorry, Stan.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.613
I actually think you as mayor
would have been fun.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.190
Maybe it's for the best.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.025
I got close the dream,
though, kids.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.860
Hey, I knit you something.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.537
It's not official,
but I think it fits.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.828
( Sniffles )

21:24.033 --> 21:25.580
Grunkle Stan,
are you <i>crying?</i>

21:25.785 --> 21:27.913
I got campaign confetti
in my eyes.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.877
Come on, kids, want to go
vandalize Mayor Tyler's mansion?

21:31.040 --> 21:33.714
Hey hey! Vandalism!
Yay!!!

21:33.918 --> 21:37.468
I'm sorry the election thing
didn't work out for you, bro.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.843
If it makes you feel any better,

21:39.048 --> 21:40.675
we're gonna throw
a riot tonight.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.264
Does someone
want to throw a riot?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.938
Thanks, Ghost Eyes,
I'm just not in the mood.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.147
This poster is the only thing
keeping me going.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.160
I'm finally ready
to make a deal.
