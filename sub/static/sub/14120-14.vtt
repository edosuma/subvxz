WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:02.568
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:39.205 --> 00:41.640
Oh, hey, mate. How's it going?

00:43.176 --> 00:45.244
-Hey.
-Terry.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.814
Terry? Oh, yes, Terry.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.015
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

00:50.017 --> 00:51.850
It's already been a week, huh?

00:51.852 --> 00:54.686
Yep, time goes by fast.

00:54.688 --> 00:55.854
(LAUGHS)

00:55.856 --> 00:57.656
Really does.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.993
Yeah, really.
Really does, doesn't it?

01:00.995 --> 01:03.829
The, uh... Yep.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.665
So, what's, uh,
what's the good word?

01:06.667 --> 01:07.900
Uh, what?

01:07.902 --> 01:10.769
What's going on, you know?
What you been up to?

01:10.771 --> 01:13.439
Fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.442
Nice. You know, you've got it
figured out, man.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.943
Man, I thought
I had it figured out,

01:17.945 --> 01:20.279
but you,
you're the figure-outer.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.880
Look at you. You spend all day

01:21.882 --> 01:24.716
living with the champ,
hanging out. (LAUGHS)

01:24.718 --> 01:27.152
Whoo, I bet
you get the girls, eh?

01:27.154 --> 01:29.388
Few of the old, uh, ladies?

01:33.026 --> 01:35.227
I was telling my friend
about you, actually.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.063
You know, he goes,
"There's no such thing
as a talking bird."

01:38.065 --> 01:40.632
(LAUGHS) And I was like,
"Oh, really? Really?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.601
"What do you call a parrot,
you dickhead?"

01:42.603 --> 01:43.535
(LAUGHS)

01:43.537 --> 01:45.304
Yeah, he was
pretty quiet after that.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.439
Oh, yeah? Hey, Terry,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.775
I might not be able
to hear you.

01:49.777 --> 01:54.012
On the account of
I am listening to music
on my headphones now.

01:54.014 --> 01:58.217
All right. Sorry, I didn't see
the, uh, see the headphones.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.852
Are they new ones, are they?

01:59.854 --> 02:02.488
Are they little,
little tiny ones,
the modern ones.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.989
They're getting smaller,
aren't they?

02:03.991 --> 02:06.225
They're put on right inside
of the ear, are they?

02:07.861 --> 02:09.094
No, he can't hear me.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.130
It's weird how
he was hearing me.

02:13.533 --> 02:14.766
(HUMMING)

02:18.037 --> 02:19.505
Come outside and sit with me.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.673
Mmm, after
the pool guy's gone.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.508
He's so weird.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.376
Uh, every time he sees me,

02:24.378 --> 02:26.411
he tells me I should put
sun block on.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.747
And every time,
I tell him I'm a ghost.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.616
And then the next time
I see him,

02:30.618 --> 02:31.917
(MIMICKING TERRY)
"You better put some
sun block on."

02:31.919 --> 02:33.385
He's not even good at his job.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.287
He puts way too much
chlorine in.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.122
Your father can't bear to
fire anybody.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.124
He hates confrontation.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.493
Oh, damn,
is that the pool guy?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.095
Yung, go out there
and tell that guy

02:43.097 --> 02:45.197
not to put so much
(BLEEP) damn
chlorine in there.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.732
It hurts my eyes.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.034
Dad, you tell him.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.670
Yung, you know I'm not good
with those type of situations.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.139
They escalate, you know.
They get all escalated,

02:54.141 --> 02:57.843
and before you know it, bam!
I'm (BLEEP) knocking
the pool guy out.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.245
Heavens to Beatrice,
I'll do it.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.614
Now, who the (BLEEP)
is this Beatrice?

03:02.616 --> 03:04.049
(PHONE RINGING)

03:04.051 --> 03:06.685
Hi, Terry, will you not put
so much chlorine in this time?

03:06.687 --> 03:10.889
Okay, but only if you put
some sun block on. All right?

03:10.891 --> 03:13.659
(LAUGHS)

03:13.661 --> 03:15.694
You should tell your buddy
to wear sun block.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.564
I know he wears a hat,
but he's really white.

03:21.234 --> 03:24.403
Oh, right, he's got this,
got the head phones on,
hasn't he?

03:28.141 --> 03:29.541
What are you talkin' about?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.843
I don't want no track suit
in another blue.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.813
It's gotta be the same blue,
Yves Klein Blue.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.583
Yeah. Yes.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.585
Yes, I want you to
check again.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.854
Wait a second,
this is Yves Klein Blue?

03:42.856 --> 03:43.889
(BLEEP) Yeah, it is.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.991
Or it used to be.
I washed it once before

03:45.993 --> 03:48.994
and there was a little bleach
in there and it faded it.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.395
What's Yves Klein Blue?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.397
Ugh. I keep forgetting
you're home-schooled.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.333
Yves Klein Blue is a unique

03:54.335 --> 03:55.801
and rather intense
shade of blue

03:55.803 --> 03:58.337
created by the famous
French artist Yves Klein.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.606
Wow! Is there anything special

04:00.608 --> 04:02.274
about the color
of my tracksuit?

04:02.276 --> 04:03.842
No, it's just regular pink.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.078
Because you're a girl.
And girls like pink.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.314
-I don't like pink.
-Well, maybe you're
transgendered.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.049
-Okay.
-Hey, champ,

04:11.051 --> 04:12.451
mind if I use your pisser?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.486
I gotta squeeze the venom
out of me lizard.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.822
You know, drain the main vein.
Need your toilet.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.358
What do you mean
some guy bought
all the Yves Klein Blue?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.059
Oop, you're on the phone.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.695
No worries.
(WHISPERING)
I'll, uh, I'll find it, mate.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.797
Why does he need
another tracksuit?

04:25.799 --> 04:27.232
Yes, I will hold.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.301
I wanna get one with shorts
and a jacket with no sleeves,

04:29.303 --> 04:30.569
you know, for the summer.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.238
False alarm. (LAUGHS)
Often happens.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.706
Yes, I'm still here.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.775
Hey, you mind if I get
a drink of, uh, of water?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.377
-Glass of water?
-Well, how long then?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.379
-Glasses in here?
-Oh, my God.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.114
So, who the (BLEEP)
bought it all?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.850
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.719
Oh, anyone mind
if I grab that orange fizzy?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.921
Looks like that might be
the last one.

04:49.923 --> 04:50.956
Here you go, friend.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.225
Somebody else talk
to this (BLEEP), please?

04:53.227 --> 04:55.294
-What?
-It's getting all escalated.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.695
I don't need confrontation.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.463
Here, Marquess,
you talk to him.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.731
I don't want to talk to him.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.566
I'll talk to him.
Hi, this is Terry.

05:01.568 --> 05:05.404
-(SINGING)
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.539
Who took the last
(BLEEP) orange drink?

05:07.541 --> 05:09.908
Oh. Oh, excellent.
Thanks for your help.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.243
-Yeah, you, too.
-(LINE DISCONNECTS)

05:11.245 --> 05:12.811
Okay, here's the situation.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.013
Now they say that...
Oh, you might wanna take

05:15.015 --> 05:16.882
your headphones off
to hear this.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.483
Eh? Oh, yeah.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.686
Let me take 'em out.
They're out.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.688
Okay. So the champ's tailor
tells me

05:22.690 --> 05:24.756
that he can't get any more
of the specific pigment,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.792
he wants to make
the summer track suit.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.795
You see, they'd have to wait
until they can manufacture
more of the pigment.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.198
The, uh, Yves Klein Blue,
I believe it's called.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.101
But, because it's an intensive
process to make the pigment,

05:36.103 --> 05:38.704
he doesn't think that
they can get their hands
on any of it till next year,

05:38.706 --> 05:42.307
which, obviously, would be
too late for the champ
to wear this summer.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.276
So, we're at a bit of a loss.

05:44.278 --> 05:47.346
Then, he suggested we contact
the person who bought
the current supply

05:47.348 --> 05:50.582
and see if we can persuade him
to sell some of the pigment
directly to us,

05:50.584 --> 05:52.718
which of course, we could then
give to the tailor

05:52.720 --> 05:54.619
to make the summer track suit.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.389
Mmm, that raises
an interesting question,
why are you in our house?

05:57.391 --> 05:58.924
I came in to use the restroom.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.726
So, who is this person
that bought it all?

06:00.728 --> 06:02.694
Great question, young man.

06:02.696 --> 06:06.365
The tailor suggested asking
the people who produce
the actual pigment.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.200
He says they are
in Paris, France.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.468
Well, team, pack your (BLEEP)

06:09.470 --> 06:10.969
It looks like
we gotta go to Paris.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.705
To ask a question?
Couldn't we just call them?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.407
None of us speak
French, Marquess.

06:15.409 --> 06:19.211
And everybody knows
90% of communication
is non-verbal.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.679
When you're face to face,

06:20.681 --> 06:23.048
you can really make
the gestures with your hands

06:23.050 --> 06:25.283
and use your facial
expressions, you know.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.419
Like here,
guess what I'm saying?

06:29.655 --> 06:32.624
-Uh, you're, you're hungry.
-And you're mad.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.659
Oh! You're mad because
you're so hungry.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.762
What? First of all, I'm happy.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.630
And I'm asking
where the post office is

06:38.632 --> 06:41.133
because I'm writing a letter
and I need to know
where the mail it.

06:41.135 --> 06:45.137
Jesus Christ, you Americans
are so (BLEEP) dumb.

06:47.140 --> 06:52.577
I need to know who bought
all the Yves Klein blue,

06:52.579 --> 06:55.747
so I could purchase some
directly from him.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.049
Oh, I speak English.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.885
Oh, damn, I guess
I could've called.

06:59.887 --> 07:03.155
I don't have a name,
but I have a shipping address.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.923
It's in Brazil. Here you are.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.092
Thank you.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.162
All right, team,
pack your (BLEEP) again.
We're going to Brazil.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.696
-Brazil?
-Great!

07:11.698 --> 07:13.565
I've always wanted to
go to Brazil.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.801
Okay, I'll get the cab
back to the hotel.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.770
Wait a second.
Why is he coming
to Brazil with us?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.939
Why did he even
come to Paris with us?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.141
I told you I'm not good
with confrontation.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.811
He asked me
if he could come
and I said, um...

07:25.813 --> 07:27.612
I didn't think that would be
a good idea.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.514
And then he said please,

07:29.516 --> 07:32.217
and I could
feel it escalating.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.187
So, I'd either say yes
or beat the living shit
out of him.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.155
Come on, guys, the cab's here!

07:37.157 --> 07:38.690
Brazil awaits.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.091
I'll tell him he's not going.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.227
I got no problem
with confrontation.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.307
Well, guys, I guess
this is good bye.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.809
Got to say, this was
the best trip I've ever taken.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.378
Probably made the best
memories I've ever made.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.981
You know, I'm hesitant to
call you the best friends
I've ever had,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.417
because to me,
it goes beyond that.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.452
You guys, you're family.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.721
Yeah? Tsk.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.656
I guess all good things
must come to an end.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.326
Why? Why? Who came up with
that phrase, you know?

08:14.328 --> 08:17.562
But it's true, I guess.
I gotta follow
the laws of life.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.797
Hmm.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.800
(SIGHING) Oh, well.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.268
Champ.

08:26.405 --> 08:27.672
Whitey.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.007
Oh, my God.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.276
-Little guy.
-Oh, don't, don't touch me.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.613
Bird. Talking bird.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.819
Oh, I'll kick myself
if I didn't try at least
one last time.

08:40.821 --> 08:44.489
-Champ, can I please
come with you to Brazil?
-Sure.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.024
-Oh, my...
-Ugh.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.726
Jesus Christ.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.800
Are you sure this is
the right address?

08:55.802 --> 08:57.068
That's the one she gave me.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.437
But this is the
Palacio da Alvorada.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.639
This is, like,
the White House,

09:00.641 --> 09:02.741
but for the
President of Brazil.

09:02.743 --> 09:07.178
What the (BLEEP) does
the President of Brazil want
with my Yves Klein Blue?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.247
Well, as you know,
Brazil is hosting

09:09.249 --> 09:11.182
the upcoming
Olympic Games in Rio,

09:11.184 --> 09:13.919
and many events will
take place in Guanabara Bay,

09:13.921 --> 09:16.588
which unfortunately is filthy.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.089
It's thick with garbage,

09:18.091 --> 09:21.126
fecal matter, toxic chemicals,
you know.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.361
Just a bunch
of shit everywhere.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.996
So?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.666
You were going to dump a bunch
of blue pigment in the water

09:27.668 --> 09:29.267
to try and make it look clean?

09:29.269 --> 09:31.069
I know. It's a (BLEEP) joke.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.538
The whole Olympics
is a (BLEEP) nightmare.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.173
The transportation
isn't ready.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.042
The housing
is behind schedule.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.010
The truck for the runners
keeps bubbling up.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.079
It's got some (BLEEP) problem.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.648
The place for
the bicycle races...

09:43.650 --> 09:45.183
The velodrome?

09:45.185 --> 09:48.286
Yes, the (BLEEP) velodrome.
It's not even built yet.

09:48.288 --> 09:52.157
So, yes, Mike Tyson,
you can have
some blue pigment.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.458
You can have it all.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.993
Oh, I only need a little bit.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.429
Enough for my tailor
to make me a summer suit.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.997
Well, why didn't you say so?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.665
I will have a suit
made for you.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.067
Brazilian style.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.303
After all, you were always
my favorite boxer.

10:05.305 --> 10:09.441
Well, you and Gerry Cooney,
and Pernell Whitaker.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.842
Sweet Pea Whitaker.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.244
You are in my
top five for sure.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.246
Oh, remember
Julio Cesar Chavez?

10:15.248 --> 10:18.116
And Duran? I love
the Mexican fighters.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.218
You are for sure
in my top 10.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.622
MIKE: Hey, team,
we've got a new mystery.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.257
Come on to the Mystery Mobile.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.294
Dad, no one's going anywhere
with you dressed like that.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.830
Wait for me. I'm coming!

10:33.366 --> 10:35.667
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

10:42.842 --> 10:44.709
(MAN SPEAKING)

10:44.711 --> 10:47.379
Yeah, the very small picture,
8' by 10'.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.148
Yeah.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.984
I thought it would be massive,
it's a little 8' by 10'.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.322
Oh, you're not getting close
to that, dude.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.924
No way, Jose.
