WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.505
Okay, I got
the whole day planned.

00:04.588 --> 00:06.215
First, we see the primates.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.175
Then, the butterfly house,
then a bathroom break, then...

00:08.258 --> 00:10.761
Oh, come on, Lois.
Can't we all just run around

00:10.844 --> 00:12.012
in a disorganized fashion?

00:12.095 --> 00:13.388
-Yeah.
-Let me go, Lois.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.848
Monkeys throw
their poo.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.726
No. If we don't adhere to a strict
schedule we won't see everything.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.020
Kids, gas masks.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.730
Run!

00:27.110 --> 00:28.195
There you are.

00:28.278 --> 00:31.114
Oh, don't be
such a pig, Mr. Pig.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.576
Oh, now where's Mr. Sheep?
Is he being Baaah-shful?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.870
( laughing )

00:36.954 --> 00:38.997
Oh, that's right.
You're all ripe for parody.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.123
Can we go now?

00:40.249 --> 00:42.084
Shut up! I'm having fun.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.379
My, someone's awfully rude.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.922
Oh! My fanny is not on the menu!

00:47.005 --> 00:48.006
Wh... what...

00:48.090 --> 00:49.091
What the... I...

00:49.174 --> 00:50.217
Ah!

00:50.300 --> 00:51.510
Ah! Oh, God! Oh, God!

00:51.593 --> 00:53.178
( screaming )

00:57.307 --> 00:58.892
Here, little fella.
Come get the food.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.272
I have always wanted to do this.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.148
Oh, here are the marsupials.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.400
( gasping )

01:06.483 --> 01:07.943
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

01:08.026 --> 01:09.486
Look at me, Lois, I'm Roo.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.654
( giggling )

01:10.737 --> 01:12.322
Come on, Ma,
let's go watch Pooh

01:12.406 --> 01:14.157
trick the bees
out of their honey

01:14.241 --> 01:16.785
by pretending he's a rain cloud.

01:16.869 --> 01:22.583
I am going to kick...
your... ass.

How's it going?

02:07.711 --> 02:09.046
Great, beautiful day.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.255
Oh, gorgeous.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.425
You know, we sit here
and force small talk

02:13.550 --> 02:15.010
while they have the time
of their lives.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.887
Yeah, yeah.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.060
( whistling )

02:23.143 --> 02:24.478
Here, girl.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.357
( sniffs )

02:28.440 --> 02:29.900
( shudders )

02:31.985 --> 02:36.740
Sorry, uh, I... I thought
I smelled... cookies.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.992
Wow, does it really
smell like cooki...

02:39.076 --> 02:41.537
Oh, God, she farted,
and it went down my throat.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.748
Full house.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.708
Dagnab, that's
some poker face

02:46.792 --> 02:48.293
you've got, Peter.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.962
Years of practice, boys.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.630
Peter, you're on a roll.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.007
We ought to get you down
to Atlantic City this weekend.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.884
Uh, sorry, guys,
Lois is making me visit

02:55.968 --> 02:57.135
the in-laws this weekend.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.054
I don't know why
she even bothers.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.181
Me and Lois' old man
have never gotten along.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.309
Hey, I got an e-mail
from Mr. Pewterschmidt.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.311
You should find some
common ground

03:06.395 --> 03:08.063
with your father-in-law, Peter.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.898
Figure out what he likes,
and study up on it.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.900
Hey, that's a great idea.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.819
I'll learn how to act
like a rich guy.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.195
In fact, I'm going
to start right now.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.280
Cratchit!

03:16.363 --> 03:17.364
You're working
through Christmas!

03:17.447 --> 03:19.283
But, sir, what of Tiny Tim?

03:19.366 --> 03:20.576
Bah!

03:20.659 --> 03:21.952
He and his ukulele
shall go wanting.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.665
Huh, The New Yorker.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.959
I bet Lois' dad reads this.

03:29.042 --> 03:33.005
"I'd be more apathetic
if I weren't so lethargic."

03:43.557 --> 03:45.767
( laughing ):
Oh, I get it.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.561
Yeah, that's kind of funny.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.979
Yeah, can I have
a copy of Juggs?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.818
In French, when you want to say
"yes," you say "oui, oui."

03:54.902 --> 03:56.820
You got to be kidding me.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.907
Oh, my God!
That is hysterical.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.034
( laughing ):
Oh, man.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.244
What do you say for "no"?
"Doo-doo?"

04:04.328 --> 04:05.746
( laughing )

04:05.829 --> 04:07.706
Hey, I'll be right back.
I got to go take a wicked "yes."

04:16.965 --> 04:18.926
ALL:
Oh.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.469
It's a person.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.598
Peter, would you please
fix the bathroom faucet?

04:24.681 --> 04:25.933
I fixed it already.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.184
No, you didn't,
it's still dripping.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.769
No way.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.521
I will give you all
my Star Wars guys if it is.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.189
W-wait-- except Boba Fett.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.816
No matter how sure I am,
I never risk the Fett-man.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.654
Oh, my God.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.325
Was... was he just mastur...

04:43.408 --> 04:45.494
-Yes.
-Oh, my.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.121
Do we... do we rub
his nose in it?

04:50.457 --> 04:54.419
Oh, uh, hi, Brian.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.922
Uh, listen, Lois,
uh, a-about yesterday...

04:57.005 --> 04:59.550
Oh, Brian, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.801
It's perfectly normal.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.344
No, I-I know,
it's just...

05:02.469 --> 05:03.637
You know,
I should be able

05:03.720 --> 05:05.305
to control my baser
instincts, but...

05:05.389 --> 05:07.891
Lately, I've just been
having these... urges.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.101
Brian, why
don't you

05:09.184 --> 05:10.811
come up to my parents'
house with us?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.396
The fresh air will
help you relax.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.023
Mm, I know where I go
when I want to relax.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.608
( loud techno music plays )

05:16.692 --> 05:17.693
I know the guy

05:17.776 --> 05:19.111
that owns this place!

05:19.194 --> 05:20.195
What?!

05:20.279 --> 05:22.239
I said,
I know the guy...!

05:22.322 --> 05:24.950
Oh, I'll tell you later,
I love this song!

05:29.872 --> 05:32.207
Thanks, but I think a quiet
weekend here by myself

05:32.291 --> 05:33.584
is just the thing I need.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.211
Well, have a good time.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.880
All right.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.465
I'm just going to relax, mellow
out, and watch some television.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.551
ANNOUNCER: We now return to
World's Sluttiest Dogs

05:42.634 --> 05:45.387
on Fox.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.931
Hey, wait up!

05:49.141 --> 05:50.142
( Peter laughing )

05:50.225 --> 05:51.602
Right into the bumper!

05:57.816 --> 05:59.568
Hi, Mom.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.653
Oh, look at you all.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.906
Oh, I know someone who's
getting a gift certificate

06:03.989 --> 06:05.866
for liposuction
in her stocking.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.034
Thank you, Nana.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.118
Hello, everyone.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.203
Hi, Daddy.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.121
Bonjour,
Monsieur Pewterschmidt.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.539
Did Peter have
a stroke?

06:12.623 --> 06:14.708
No, Daddy, Peter's
cultured himself--

06:14.791 --> 06:16.585
like Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.463
Oh, so I should treat him
like a high-class whore?

06:21.465 --> 06:24.134
That's fine,
just no kissing on the lips.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.970
Would you like
a piece of candy?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.972
I smell death on you.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.976
Ahoy, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.937
Permission to come aboard?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.063
-No.
-Thanks!

06:36.146 --> 06:38.565
Hey, quite a schooner
you got here.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.817
What is she, like, a 45-footer?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.611
Peter, I didn't know
you were a sailor.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.530
I didn't know you looked
so good in shorts!

06:44.613 --> 06:46.073
( whistling and purring )
What?

06:46.156 --> 06:48.116
You don't have an eye spliced
in this mooring line.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.452
Here, I'll just tie a bowline in there
and make one for you.

06:50.702 --> 06:51.703
That should hold her.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.835
And this is a '74 Pinot Noir.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.045
Mm, lovely.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.672
Carter, did you tell
your son-in-law

07:01.755 --> 07:03.340
he's not supposed
to swallow the wine?

07:03.423 --> 07:04.925
( giggling ):
Hey... Hey...

07:05.008 --> 07:06.969
( slurring ): Where the hell
is that Peter Griffin?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.971
He said he'd give me $100

07:09.054 --> 07:11.557
if I took off
all my clothes off.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.100
( groaning )

07:15.143 --> 07:16.311
Thanks for bringing
me here, Lois.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.437
This is just
what I needed.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.730
Oh, I'm glad.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.983
It seems like everybody's
having a lot of fun.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.734
So, how long are you
and your family in tow...

07:22.818 --> 07:25.362
Uh-uh, no conversation.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.738
You idiot!

07:26.822 --> 07:28.740
I'm never taking you
to my country club again.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.367
Look, I'm sorry,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.660
Your husband
is a moron.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.412
He walks up
to the Premier of China

07:33.495 --> 07:36.665
and says, "Dong, where
is my automobile?"

07:37.457 --> 07:39.710
Lois, I tried to fit in
with your Dad's crowd

07:39.793 --> 07:40.961
but it's worse than before.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.379
I tell you, this sucks worse

07:42.462 --> 07:43.922
than that time
I was on Survivor.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.091
How dare you wash
your clothes

07:46.175 --> 07:48.093
in our drinking
water, B.B.!

07:48.177 --> 07:49.761
Now how are we
going to survive

07:49.845 --> 07:52.264
in this harsh,
unforgiving terrain?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.058
All right, Donnie, make sure the
wheel goes all the way around...

07:55.267 --> 07:57.644
( feigned surprise ):
Oh, oh, no, headhunters.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.896
( feigned fear ):
Ooh...

07:58.979 --> 08:00.105
Am I fired?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.399
Daddy, Peter's been
trying really hard

08:02.482 --> 08:03.901
to get you to like him.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.360
Couldn't you give him
another chance?

08:05.444 --> 08:07.070
Let him join your poker
game tomorrow night?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.155
Sorry, honey

08:08.238 --> 08:10.324
I'd rather be
stuck in an elevator

08:10.407 --> 08:13.410
with Nathan Lane, Gilbert
Godfried, Carrot Top

08:13.493 --> 08:16.747
uh, Sean Hayes...
Oh, you get the picture.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.457
-Please?
-No!

08:18.540 --> 08:20.000
Okay.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.668
You know, maybe later
I'll take Mom

08:21.752 --> 08:22.878
by the shoeshine place

08:22.961 --> 08:24.922
and introduce her to
that nice mulatto boy

08:25.005 --> 08:26.507
who looks an awful
lot like...

08:26.590 --> 08:28.550
Say, would, uh, Peter
like to play poker with us?

08:28.634 --> 08:29.635
He'd love to, Daddy.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.719
That sounds dynamite.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.893
Brian, come over here
and meet Sea Breeze

08:38.018 --> 08:39.228
my prize-winning dog.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.104
Isn't she a perfect specimen?

08:41.313 --> 08:42.481
I mean, look at these legs

08:42.564 --> 08:43.982
and that beautiful coat

08:44.066 --> 08:46.151
and feel the heat
coming off of her genitalia--

08:46.235 --> 08:47.486
you could roast
a marshmallow.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.154
That's how you
can tell she's a champion.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.447
Go on, put your hand there.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.574
Oh... boy, that is...
that-that is...

08:52.658 --> 08:53.992
Is that something?

08:54.076 --> 08:55.369
That-that-that
is something.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.995
That is... that is hot.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.914
Isn't she the most beautiful dog
you've ever seen?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.165
Yes, yes.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.167
Sh-She is a beautiful dog.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.586
( sighing ):
And that's... okay.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.798
Gentlemen, this is Peter.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.424
He's the idiot
my daughter married.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.509
Michael Eisner.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.718
Bill Gates.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.595
Bill, Peter's an
antitrust lawyer

09:13.679 --> 09:15.222
with the Justice Department.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.975
Ah, just kidding, he's a
fisherman or some stupid thing.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.268
Hey, fellas.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.645
Wow, Ted Turner!

09:21.728 --> 09:23.272
I told you guys
not to invite him.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.523
Oh, he must have
followed us.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.607
Come on, ladies.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.526
We going to play cards
or what?

09:27.609 --> 09:29.194
Peter, why don't
you deal?

09:29.278 --> 09:30.988
Okay, guys, we're playing
Texas Hold 'Em.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.281
Are aces high or low?

09:32.364 --> 09:33.657
They go both ways.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.742
( giggling ):
He said "They go both ways."

09:35.826 --> 09:37.536
( laughing )

09:37.619 --> 09:39.580
Like a bisexual.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.456
Thank you, Ted,
that was the joke.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.002
I see your bet, Carter

09:45.085 --> 09:46.795
and I raise you CNN.

09:46.879 --> 09:47.963
Oh, I don't think I can...

09:48.046 --> 09:49.756
Wait, w-wait.
You can beat him

09:49.840 --> 09:51.508
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
he's bluffing.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.676
Peter, he just bet CNN.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.969
There's no way
he's bluffing.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.637
I'm sure he is.
He's got a tell.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.931
Listen, if you lose this hand,
I'll divorce your daughter.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.016
I'm in.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.184
All right, Teddy, I'll see

10:00.267 --> 10:01.435
your CNN with U.S. Steel.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.437
-What have you got?
-Two pair.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.771
Ace high, straight.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.899
You sold me out!
I could use a man like you.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.525
How's a million
a year sound?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.861
You disgust me.
Get out of my face!

10:12.654 --> 10:13.697
Peter, that's
the first time

10:13.780 --> 10:15.240
any of us have
ever beaten Ted.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.075
Yeah, how did you
know he was bluffing?

10:17.159 --> 10:19.244
When he lies,
he blinks twice.

10:19.328 --> 10:22.080
I first noticed it when he did
that Barbara Walters' interview

10:22.164 --> 10:23.707
and he said he'd be
with Jane Fonda forever.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.125
Well, I'm going to turn in.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.335
Yeah, me too.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.045
I got to be at Disneyland
before it opens.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.005
We're ethnically cleansing
the Small World ride.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.174
Oh, come on, you guys
practically run this country.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.967
There's got to be a ton
of fun stuff we could do.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.598
( laughing and whooping )

10:39.681 --> 10:41.683
Oh, man, there's
a tollbooth.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.061
Hey, anybody got a quarter?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.145
What's a quarter?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.856
Well, we got to
give him something.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.944
( laughing and whooping )

10:53.862 --> 10:55.781
Man, looking
up at the sky

10:55.864 --> 10:57.282
just makes you
feel so small.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.159
Yeah.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.496
I mean, if God created all this,
who created God?

11:02.579 --> 11:04.289
Maybe he created himself.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.041
Or herself.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.168
( thoughtful murmuring )

11:08.252 --> 11:09.753
Neat. This guy's deep,
Carter.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.004
Where'd you find him?

11:11.088 --> 11:12.714
He's my son-in-law.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.258
( cell phone rings )

11:14.341 --> 11:15.592
Okay, honey. I got to go.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.803
-You want a ride?
-Sure.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.687
Wow.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.938
You know, Peter

11:28.021 --> 11:30.274
I actually had a good time
with you tonight

11:30.357 --> 11:31.733
and I just want to say...

11:31.817 --> 11:33.569
well, I'm glad
you married my daughter.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.571
Oh, thank you, Jesus!

11:35.654 --> 11:37.614
Oh, a-actually, it wasn't me.
It was...

11:37.698 --> 11:39.449
It's okay. I am used to it.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.496
Having fun, Peter?

11:44.580 --> 11:46.081
Oh, you bet.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.041
I put all my poker winnings
on your dog, Mr. P.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.626
Dog?

11:51.128 --> 11:52.796
You've got nothing
to worry about.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.881
Sea Breeze is
a sure thing.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.215
Sea Breeze?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.343
Dad, where
are the jockeys?

11:58.427 --> 12:00.179
They're all in
the laundry, son.

12:00.262 --> 12:01.805
I'm going Indian today.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.269
ALL:
Come on, Sea Breeze!

12:07.352 --> 12:08.520
Yeah!

12:08.604 --> 12:10.814
Come on, Sea Breeze,
come on!

12:10.898 --> 12:12.566
( lustful groan )

12:12.649 --> 12:15.319
What's Brian doing?

12:19.031 --> 12:20.490
Oh, my God.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.075
He's violating
Sea Breeze!

12:22.159 --> 12:24.453
Oh, no, he's just
awkwardly positioning himself...

12:24.536 --> 12:26.163
Now he's violating
Sea Breeze.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.208
( imitating porn jazz riff)

12:36.757 --> 12:38.175
Mr. Pewterschmidt, again

12:38.258 --> 12:40.177
I just want to tell you
how sorry I am about this.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.762
I don't know what came over me.

12:41.845 --> 12:44.264
You'd better not have
ruined my race dog.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.266
Brian, I am
very disappointed in you.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.643
I'd turn my back on you

12:47.726 --> 12:49.853
but I've seen what you do
in that situation.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.271
Now, if you'll excuse me

12:51.355 --> 12:53.398
Carter and I
have a polio match to attend.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.775
Get away from me--

12:54.858 --> 12:56.610
you and that filthy
mongrel of yours!

12:56.735 --> 12:57.736
How is she, Doctor?

12:57.819 --> 12:58.987
She's fine.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.656
Sea Breeze will be able
to race again.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.367
But, unfortunately,
not for another nine weeks.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.743
She's pregnant.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.371
Look, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
I just want you to know

13:07.454 --> 13:09.081
I am going to do
the right thing here.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.624
You're not
doing anything.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.209
In fact, you're never going to see
Sea Breeze again.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.877
All of you,
pack your things and get out!

13:13.961 --> 13:15.629
I am never speaking
to you again.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.381
Don't worry,
Mr. Pewterschmidt

13:17.464 --> 13:18.674
I have a plan.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.425
I am going
to go back in time

13:20.509 --> 13:23.053
and stop Brian from
getting it on with your dog.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.305
Everybody stand back.

13:25.389 --> 13:29.476
( making whirring noise )

13:29.601 --> 13:30.811
( groaning )

13:30.894 --> 13:32.729
Uh, oh, oh, boy.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.982
A-ah!

13:36.733 --> 13:39.444
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
please can we still be pals?

13:39.528 --> 13:40.904
See, look,
I made a picture

13:40.988 --> 13:42.823
of you and me
out of glue and macaroni.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.283
Peter, that means
a lot to me

13:44.366 --> 13:45.367
because you made it.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.451
Really?

13:46.535 --> 13:47.536
No. Get out of here!

13:47.619 --> 13:49.037
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
Sea Breeze is gone.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.122
What?!

13:50.205 --> 13:51.206
I can't find Brian.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.291
Peter, do you know

13:52.374 --> 13:54.126
what I'm going to do to you

13:54.209 --> 13:56.128
if Brian took off
with my Sea Breeze?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.380
I think I have an idea.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.509
( blubbering )

14:06.680 --> 14:08.182
This is the room.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.684
The light switch is here,
it's mostly for show.

14:10.767 --> 14:11.768
There's your Murphy bed.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.395
Don't mind
the Epsteins.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.813
They keep
to themselves.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.773
We're going to
see Bobby Darin

14:16.857 --> 14:18.817
at the Copa tomorrow,
right, Charlie?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.235
Bobby Darin tomorrow.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.528
And this is the bathroom.

14:21.612 --> 14:22.988
But watch out.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.072
We got some
bad roaches here.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.908
Hey, you're on our turf, man.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.492
Hey, man, I'll cut you.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.036
I'll cut you up so bad

14:29.119 --> 14:31.205
you gon' wish I no
cut you up so bad.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.623
Those are bad roaches.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.707
I blame the schools.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.004
Were you followed?

14:39.087 --> 14:40.506
Don't worry; I've got a decoy.

14:40.589 --> 14:41.715
Hey, Lois.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.342
Hubba-hubba...
whoa, Lois

14:43.425 --> 14:44.635
you put on a few, huh?

14:44.718 --> 14:45.761
Well, I never!

14:45.844 --> 14:47.429
That's all
right, honey.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.890
I don't think he
was the one anyway.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.517
Now, let's
go get sundaes.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.268
You know,
we all really miss you

14:53.352 --> 14:54.978
and Peter talks about you
all the time.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.104
Oh, really?

14:56.188 --> 14:57.189
Anything nice?

14:57.272 --> 14:58.357
No.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.650
Mmm, so he's
still mad, huh?

14:59.733 --> 15:00.734
Well, I should go.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.444
Here, take this.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.821
It's probably not a good idea
for us to meet anymore.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.157
Daddy swore he'd track you down
any way he could.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.163
Bingo!

15:13.247 --> 15:14.706
I told you
she'd lead us to him.

15:14.790 --> 15:15.958
Let's call Pewterschmidt.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.292
No, wait-- let's
take the jet packs.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.544
Cool!

15:20.963 --> 15:23.507
Man, the people look like ants
from up here.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.259
They are ants, Michael.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.052
They are ants.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.015
This is Tricia Takanawa
reporting live

15:32.099 --> 15:35.644
where police have discovered
the whereabouts of Sea Breeze

15:35.769 --> 15:38.188
the heiress
to the Pewterschmidt fortune.

15:38.272 --> 15:41.525
The dognapper has been traced
to this sleazy motel.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.735
Ah, I see my colleague,
Tom Tucker

15:43.819 --> 15:45.195
is already on the scene.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.864
Who's that, baby?

15:48.031 --> 15:50.200
Hello, this is Tom Tucker...'s

15:50.284 --> 15:51.994
evil twin, Todd Tucker

15:52.077 --> 15:54.663
out to destroy
his brother's reputation.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.081
Ha-ha-ha!

15:56.164 --> 15:57.541
Now I'm going back inside

15:57.624 --> 15:59.585
to have freaky sex
with my prostitute

15:59.668 --> 16:01.461
with whom
I still have 45 minutes.

16:01.545 --> 16:02.838
Now back to this breaking news.

16:14.183 --> 16:15.517
Brian, please,
eat something.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.144
Why bother?

16:17.227 --> 16:18.979
My face is plastered
all over the news

16:19.062 --> 16:22.065
your father won't let me see the dog
who's carrying my puppies

16:22.149 --> 16:24.401
and my best friend
is going to incredible lengths

16:24.484 --> 16:25.527
to ignore me.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.196
Brian, don't let him
get to you.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.739
Peter, come out
of that thing!

16:28.822 --> 16:30.407
He can't hear you, Lois.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.659
Besides, it's not him
that's getting to me.

16:32.743 --> 16:33.785
It's your father.

16:33.869 --> 16:34.995
I'm sorry.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.747
I talked to him,
but he wouldn't budge.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.956
He can be so stubborn.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.958
I don't know how
my mother puts up with it.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.628
He did promise to take good care
of the puppies, though.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.546
Well, you know, they're not his
to take care of.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.715
They're my kids,
and I'm going to get them back.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.467
My father wasn't there for me

16:48.550 --> 16:50.886
but, damn it, I'm going
to be there for my kids.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.721
I'm going to sue your dad
for custody.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.314
Daddy, please, stop this.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.900
Brian has every right to see his puppies
when they're born.

17:04.983 --> 17:05.984
Sorry, Pumpkin.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.694
I had no idea
you could be so cruel.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.071
I'll never forgive you
for this.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.155
Oh, you'll be fine.

17:10.239 --> 17:11.698
You're just having
your period.

17:11.782 --> 17:13.283
This court
will now come to order.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.535
Brian

17:14.618 --> 17:15.619
do you like children?

17:15.702 --> 17:16.870
I-I love children.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.163
That's why I'm here.

17:18.247 --> 17:20.457
I want the opportunity
to raise my puppies.

17:20.541 --> 17:23.168
Do you remember an incident
at a South Attleboro Denny's

17:23.252 --> 17:24.962
in December of 1996?

17:25.128 --> 17:26.421
Uh, yeah, I guess.

17:27.005 --> 17:30.342
( bawling )

17:34.847 --> 17:37.683
Waa! Waa!
You like that, huh?!

17:37.808 --> 17:40.060
You like that?! Waa!!!

17:40.143 --> 17:43.564
You just tune this out,
don't you?! Waa!!!

17:43.647 --> 17:45.858
Well, tune this out!
Waa!!!

17:47.234 --> 17:49.069
( cries )
Waa!

17:49.152 --> 17:50.779
Waa!
( cries )

17:50.863 --> 17:52.865
( cries )
Shut up!

17:52.948 --> 17:54.116
Look, I was angry

17:54.199 --> 17:56.118
because my Moon Over My Hammy
was overcooked.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.036
I also have
your rental records

17:58.120 --> 17:59.329
from the Quahog
video store.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.415
Can you read
the last two titles, please?

18:01.498 --> 18:03.959
Uh, Son-In-Law and Biodome.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.711
And who's the star
of those films?

18:05.794 --> 18:06.795
Uh, Paulie Shore.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.213
Paulie... Shore.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.551
But, I...
I-I rented those for Peter.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.844
He got banned
from the video store

18:13.927 --> 18:14.970
for taping over their movies.

18:18.432 --> 18:19.766
Rosebud.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.103
It's his sled.

18:23.187 --> 18:25.397
It was his sled
from when he was a kid.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.525
There, I just saved you
two long, boob-less hours.

18:28.609 --> 18:31.195
How convenient;
blame it on someone else.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.739
Is that the kind of man
we want raising these puppies?

18:33.822 --> 18:35.824
Peter...

18:35.908 --> 18:37.534
Oh, you've got to believe me,
Your Honor.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.453
Peter, I'm putting together
another card game.

18:39.578 --> 18:40.579
You in?

18:40.662 --> 18:42.581
Y-you want me to play?

18:42.706 --> 18:43.707
Absolutely.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.584
But first, I want you to testify

18:45.667 --> 18:47.419
against that horny mutt
of yours.

18:47.503 --> 18:48.962
I-I don't know
if I can do that.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.756
Ooh, that's too bad

18:50.839 --> 18:53.050
because Bill and Michael really want
to see you again.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.426
They're coming over later

18:54.510 --> 18:56.053
and Bill's going to bring
his Stretch Armstrong.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.889
Oh, man, and his arms
stretch out to next week!

18:58.972 --> 19:01.683
Your Honor, Peter Griffin
would like to take the stand.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.022
Mr. Griffin, which of
the following two phrases

19:07.105 --> 19:08.774
best describes
Brian Griffin?

19:08.857 --> 19:10.150
Problem drinker

19:10.234 --> 19:11.818
or African-American
haberdasher?

19:11.902 --> 19:13.904
Um... I-I guess problem
drinker, but that's...

19:13.987 --> 19:15.197
Thank you.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.407
Now: sexual deviant,
or magic picture

19:17.491 --> 19:20.244
that-if-you-stare-at-it-
long-enough-you-see-something?

19:20.327 --> 19:22.162
Well, sexual deviant,
but that other one's...

19:22.329 --> 19:23.330
Thank you.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.623
Now, isn't it true

19:24.706 --> 19:26.250
that you told my client,
Carter Pewterschmidt

19:26.333 --> 19:28.210
that Brian
is a menace to society

19:28.293 --> 19:30.379
and should never be allowed
to see his children?

19:30.546 --> 19:31.547
( all gasping )

19:31.630 --> 19:32.923
Uh... uh...

19:39.638 --> 19:42.975
Brian should be allowed
to see his puppies.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.643
Peter,
think about what you're doing.

19:44.726 --> 19:45.811
I am.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.688
Your Honor, Brian will be
a great dad.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.565
Hell, if I
was half the parent Brian is

19:49.648 --> 19:51.066
I'd know
that Chris' favorite ice cream is...

19:51.149 --> 19:52.150
Chocolate chip.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.862
-And Stewie's favorite bedtime story is..
-Goodnight, Moon.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.071
And Meg's real father's name is...

19:56.154 --> 19:57.155
Stan Thompson.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.742
I've heard enough.

20:00.826 --> 20:03.495
I do believe that Brian
would be a successful parent.

20:03.579 --> 20:06.248
However, if he was to repeat
his actions at the dog track

20:06.331 --> 20:08.667
he would be setting
a bad example for his puppies.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.295
Therefore, I grant Brian custody
with the condition

20:11.378 --> 20:12.796
that he be neutered first.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.423
Yeah! You did it, buddy!

20:14.506 --> 20:15.591
Oh, congratulations!

20:15.716 --> 20:17.342
Oh, man!

20:17.426 --> 20:18.802
What does "neutered" mean?

20:21.096 --> 20:22.639
You're almost there,
Sea Breeze.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.350
Oh, and, uh, also, uh,
I-I didn't bring this up before

20:25.475 --> 20:27.811
but, uh, promise me
you won't eat any of them.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.354
You know, Brian,
it occurs to me

20:29.438 --> 20:30.939
that this is like
a Greek tragedy

20:31.023 --> 20:32.149
where a man must choose

20:32.232 --> 20:33.817
between himself
and his children.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.570
Of course, you'll be playing
the role of Sanstesticles.

20:36.695 --> 20:37.905
( snickering )

20:38.071 --> 20:39.489
We're ready for you
down the hall.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.160
Are you sure you want to go
through with this, Brian?

20:43.243 --> 20:45.245
'Cause, you know, you could
have puppies with another dog.

20:45.329 --> 20:46.955
Oh, or maybe
with a condor.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.707
Yeah, then you'd have
flying puppies.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.375
Would you like that, Brian?

20:50.459 --> 20:51.460
Huh? Flying puppies?

20:51.543 --> 20:52.836
No, Peter.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.630
Those puppies in there
are mine

20:54.713 --> 20:57.299
and I'll give anything
to be with them. Anything.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.093
I am not looking forward
to what you're going to be like

21:00.177 --> 21:01.220
once they do this to you.

21:02.346 --> 21:06.517
Mmm, I love chocolate!

21:07.726 --> 21:11.146
But I can't eat it,
because then I'll get fat.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.815
But it's so good!

21:14.733 --> 21:15.943
Are you ready, Brian?

21:16.401 --> 21:17.653
I guess so.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.072
Stop! Brian,
come quick.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.868
Oh, my God!
Those aren't my puppies.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.620
Well, then, whose are they?

21:26.995 --> 21:30.165
( puppies saying
"woof" and "bark" )

21:30.249 --> 21:32.167
You-you're a whore!

21:32.251 --> 21:34.419
A filthy, filthy whore!

21:35.379 --> 21:37.005
You must be so relieved.

21:37.089 --> 21:38.423
Well, actually, I...

21:38.507 --> 21:40.801
I was kind of looking forward
to being a dad.

21:40.884 --> 21:41.885
Well, don't worry.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.345
There will be other chances.

21:43.428 --> 21:44.429
You know
what's funny?

21:44.513 --> 21:47.933
I always thought that
dogs, um, laid eggs.

21:49.101 --> 21:50.853
And I learned
something today.
