WEBVTT

00:03.208 --> 00:04.675
Over there! I saw him!

00:04.677 --> 00:05.776
This way, Detectives.

00:05.778 --> 00:06.844
What do we got?

00:06.846 --> 00:08.345
Male bleeding heavily
from his abdomen.

00:08.347 --> 00:10.614
EMTs are working
on him now.

00:12.784 --> 00:14.251
Hey, is he talking?

00:14.253 --> 00:15.486
He's circling the drain.

00:15.488 --> 00:16.487
What's his name?
Lee.

00:16.489 --> 00:18.622
Lee, do you know
who did this to you?

00:18.624 --> 00:20.257
- Losing him.
- Sir?

00:20.259 --> 00:22.893
If he knows, he ain't saying.

00:22.895 --> 00:24.628
Detectives.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.063
They have the perp in custody.

00:26.065 --> 00:28.332
Where is he?

00:28.334 --> 00:30.201
This way.

00:30.203 --> 00:32.302
Step back. Hey,
step back, everyone.

00:32.305 --> 00:33.470
Get back!

00:33.472 --> 00:34.872
At least tell me he's dead.
What?

00:34.874 --> 00:36.040
At least tell me he's dead.

00:36.042 --> 00:37.541
At least tell me
that monkey's dead.

00:37.543 --> 00:40.244
Yeah, he's dead.
You owning it?

00:40.246 --> 00:42.346
I guess I am,
though I got regrets.

00:42.348 --> 00:44.748
That's good to hear.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.650
I regret I couldn't see
he was just a old ape.

00:46.652 --> 00:49.720
Wanted to get me
a young frisky one!

00:49.722 --> 00:50.988
The only ape around here
is you, buddy.

00:50.990 --> 00:53.657
Let him out!

00:53.659 --> 00:56.126
Get the racist out of here!

00:56.128 --> 00:57.828
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.863
I got a right to live
in a monkey-free country!

00:59.865 --> 01:00.772
Lock this up!

01:00.796 --> 01:01.967
Anything you say may
be used against you.

01:01.968 --> 01:04.367
Yeah, what I say is
go back to Africa!

01:04.370 --> 01:05.569
Shut up.

01:13.446 --> 01:15.246
You can't terminate
me for this.

01:15.248 --> 01:19.016
You don't tell me
what I can and cannot do.

01:19.018 --> 01:20.818
All right, shouldn't.

01:20.820 --> 01:23.787
Devin, it's not his choice,
it's department policy.

01:23.789 --> 01:25.656
You test positive for drugs,
you're out.

01:25.658 --> 01:26.824
Drugs, Sid?

01:26.826 --> 01:29.198
Yeah, marijuana's still drugs
in the NYPD.

01:29.199 --> 01:31.066
I had part of an edible
at the Denver airport.

01:31.068 --> 01:32.868
Bought in Colorado,
used in Colorado,

01:32.870 --> 01:34.636
left behind in Colorado.

01:34.638 --> 01:36.171
Which is legal--
I know, you told us.

01:36.173 --> 01:37.606
And you say that
like it doesn't matter.

01:37.608 --> 01:39.875
No, I say it like
it's a pain-in-the-ass excuse,

01:39.877 --> 01:41.443
which is all it is.

01:41.445 --> 01:43.745
What's legal say?

01:43.747 --> 01:45.080
That question's
above your rank.

01:45.082 --> 01:47.149
That question's like life
or death to me right now.

01:47.151 --> 01:49.151
Only life or death's
life or death.

01:49.153 --> 01:51.386
What's their take?

01:51.388 --> 01:53.288
They don't have one yet.
There's no precedent.

01:53.290 --> 01:54.990
But you, you have one?

01:54.992 --> 01:56.958
Your take is to just can my ass.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.093
It is still illegal

01:58.095 --> 02:01.029
in the NYPD,
in all city agencies,

02:01.031 --> 02:03.565
under state and federal law.

02:03.567 --> 02:05.567
I can't just look
the other way, Devin,

02:05.569 --> 02:08.804
because you decided
a Rocky Mountain high is okay.

02:08.806 --> 02:10.005
Now jokes?

02:10.840 --> 02:12.340
Hi, everyone.

02:12.342 --> 02:13.809
We got a little wrinkle.

02:13.811 --> 02:15.510
I hate that phrase.

02:15.512 --> 02:18.113
Okay. I got bad news. Better?

02:18.115 --> 02:19.815
Our mayor got wind

02:19.817 --> 02:21.983
of Chief Jones's predicament
and wants in.

02:21.985 --> 02:23.018
"Wants in"?

02:23.020 --> 02:24.519
She's very pro-legalization.

02:24.521 --> 02:26.321
She wants in on the next move.

02:26.323 --> 02:29.291
It's an NYPD matter.

02:29.293 --> 02:31.860
There's no room on the bus.
She leaks this to the press,

02:31.862 --> 02:33.795
we're gonna need
a much bigger bus.

02:33.797 --> 02:34.863
She'd do that?

02:34.865 --> 02:36.498

Police! Stop!

02:53.951 --> 02:55.484
- Hey!
- I got him!

02:56.385 --> 02:57.986
I got him! Hey!

02:58.821 --> 03:01.089
- Watch out!
- Hey!

03:01.924 --> 03:03.992
Hey!

03:03.994 --> 03:05.360
Police! Stop him!

03:05.362 --> 03:07.562
Hey, give me a hand!

03:07.564 --> 03:10.599
Help me! Come on!

03:18.307 --> 03:20.075
Don't move.

03:21.744 --> 03:23.011
Come on.

03:23.013 --> 03:26.014
Hey. You okay?

03:26.016 --> 03:28.016
No. I'm not okay. Hey!

03:28.018 --> 03:29.317
Take this.

03:29.319 --> 03:30.752
Yeah, you, numbnuts.

03:30.754 --> 03:33.021
I'm talking to you.
Come here.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.994
Skip Fuller.

03:38.996 --> 03:41.563
Yeah. You are?
Eddie Janko. Do you remember me?

03:41.565 --> 03:44.332
Oh, no. What? You're a cop?

03:44.334 --> 03:47.135
Oh, yeah, I'm a cop, and right
now, never happier to be one.

03:47.137 --> 03:48.303
Put your hands behind your back.

03:48.305 --> 03:49.971
Eddie. Eddie.
No, I got this.

03:49.973 --> 03:51.740
You got what?
What is this?

03:51.742 --> 03:52.974
You're under arrest.

03:52.976 --> 03:55.677
In violation of
New York penal code 195.10,

03:55.679 --> 03:57.212
titled "Refusing to aid
a police officer.

03:57.214 --> 03:58.476
No way.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.049
Yeah, way.
Put your hands behind your back.

04:00.050 --> 04:02.050
Whoa, whoa.
I didn't do anything.

04:02.052 --> 04:03.552
Exactly. Story of your life.

04:03.554 --> 04:04.920
Oh.
All right.

04:04.922 --> 04:06.354
Hey!
Now I'm adding

04:06.356 --> 04:07.722
an additional charge
of resisting arrest

04:07.724 --> 04:09.057
and obstructing

04:09.059 --> 04:11.059
governmental administration.

04:11.061 --> 04:12.427
You're gonna want
to start cooperating.

04:12.429 --> 04:13.528
Oh.

04:13.530 --> 04:16.430
This is funny, huh, Skip?
Real funny.

04:21.704 --> 04:23.438
I got this, Jamie.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.340
Come on, Skip. Let's go.

Oh, here?

04:57.898 --> 04:59.898
Yeah, right there,
where it says "signature"?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.433
You sure
you don't want a lawyer?

05:02.168 --> 05:03.535
I'm just dotting all the "I"s.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.671
- Can't afford no lawyer.
- See there?

05:05.673 --> 05:07.873
But you are aware that one
would be provided for you,

05:07.875 --> 05:09.207
at no cost.
Yeah, I heard that.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.242
You're still willing

05:10.244 --> 05:11.910
to talk without
a lawyer present?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.879
Jalapeño here speak
English? I said no.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.248
Swamp Thing said no.
Did you hear him? Good.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.450
Let's go.
Send over some Jew.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.652
Jew finds out I killed a monkey,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.487
he'd talk to all the other Jews
at the courthouse.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.323
Next thing you know,
I'm swinging from a tree.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.224
Well, we don't have
the death penalty

05:26.226 --> 05:27.959
here in New York. What a pity.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.561
Sure is. Sign your name.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.296
While we're at it,
are there any other homicides

05:31.298 --> 05:32.564
you'd like
to confess to,

05:32.566 --> 05:34.933
Mr. Pitney?
I'm sure the D.A.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.735
would look favorably upon
any assistance you can give

05:36.737 --> 05:37.769
in any unsolved cases.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.771
Nice try.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.773
Okay. Sure about that?

05:41.775 --> 05:44.242
Okay. Tell you what.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.545
I'll spill some beans.
Okay.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.281
Just as soon as you give me that
citizenship medal I got coming

05:49.283 --> 05:52.084
for all my efforts
to take our country back.

05:52.086 --> 05:55.220
We'll get you that medal
right away.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.923
Then you can shove it
up your ass.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.495
Let's go.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.297
You know the drill.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.832
What's with this guy?

06:06.834 --> 06:09.601
Obstructing, resisting arrest,
refusal to aid a police officer.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.836
Namely, me.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.038
Sarge, give us a sec?

06:15.942 --> 06:17.976
What?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.878
You tell me.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.513
What's your beef
with this guy?

06:21.515 --> 06:22.614
No beef.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.915
He failed to aid
a police officer,

06:23.917 --> 06:25.517
and I need to teach
him a lesson.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.985
Then just give him
a desk appearance ticket

06:26.987 --> 06:28.787
for the refusing to aid
and be done with it.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.155
You charge resisting,
he goes into the system.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.523
He escalated things, not me.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.791
Eddie, he didn't threaten you.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.892
He didn't even
really resist.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.926
Yeah, he did.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.429
I'll have to testify
to what I saw,

06:37.431 --> 06:39.564
and I'm not sure I can turn
spiking a racquet

06:39.566 --> 06:40.999
into resisting arrest
and obstructing.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.067
Yeah, you can.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.802
Not enough to stick.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.303
You have my back, Reagan?

06:45.305 --> 06:47.906
Eddie, I'm telling you
that I don't think what I saw

06:47.908 --> 06:49.941
was enough to put this guy
in the system.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.377
Well, why don't we let the D.A.
decide what's enough?

06:52.379 --> 06:53.412
Copy?

06:53.414 --> 06:55.180
Eddie, what's the beef?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.717
Just trust me, okay?

06:59.819 --> 07:01.386
Come on, Skip.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.722
You're up.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.463
So I looked
Chief Jones up.

07:11.465 --> 07:14.466
And he's got quite a record
with your department.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.867
Yes, he does. So?

07:15.869 --> 07:20.472
Do you know what the first words
in any story about him will be?

07:20.474 --> 07:22.474
I can guess. "Hero cop."

07:22.476 --> 07:23.542
Newscast, too.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.043
"Hero cop fired

07:25.045 --> 07:27.946
by NYPD for..."?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.147
"Rocky Mountain High"?

07:29.149 --> 07:30.248
Exactly.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.316
Story at 11:00.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.518
Doesn't that sound
inspiring, Frank?

07:33.520 --> 07:37.022
If I ran my department off
what the headlines might be,

07:37.024 --> 07:39.491
my people would've mutinied
a long time ago,

07:39.493 --> 07:40.959
and they'd have every right to.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.662
So he's never considered

07:43.664 --> 07:45.697
the implications
of his decisions?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.432
Is that what he's saying?

07:47.434 --> 07:48.433
Of course not.

07:48.435 --> 07:49.468
Then talk to him.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.070
He can speak for himself,
believe me.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.007
Maggie.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.744
If you run this up the flagpole
before I've made a decision,

07:59.746 --> 08:02.981
you will be cutting
my command out from under me.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.316
You don't want that.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.853
What I don't want to do
is silence this man

08:07.855 --> 08:12.491
on the issue
of archaic marijuana laws.

08:12.493 --> 08:16.962
"Mayor Makes Hero Cop Mascot
in Legal Pot Push."

08:21.834 --> 08:24.636
Is that the headline
you're looking for?

08:24.638 --> 08:25.804
No.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.305
'Cause that's
what it's gonna be.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.509
I am looking out
for my officer, period.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.644
This is an NYPD matter, period.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.078
Hands off.

08:53.399 --> 08:54.933
What is a <i>real</i> Samaritan?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.668
Uh, let's find out.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.274
Keep an eye open.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.781
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.716
Need to talk
to whoever's in charge here.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.184
Kyle Wentworth,
Detectives.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.988
We have a warrant to seize
the effects of one Duane Pitney.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.890
Gave this
as his last address.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.358
He was here barely a week.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.793
What's this about?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.696
It's about he murdered a man
about ten blocks from here.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.499
Old man. <i>Black</i> old man.

09:27.501 --> 09:28.533
What, you didn't hear?

09:28.535 --> 09:29.701
That was Pitney?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.803
Well, we spent enough time
with him to reason, uh,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.271
probably wasn't
his first hate crime.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.140
Can't link him to us.
We barely knew him.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.008
We're not trying to link
anything to anybody.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.144
We're just here to get his stuff.
If he gave this

09:39.146 --> 09:41.279
as his last address,
and the press gets hold...

09:41.281 --> 09:42.581
That's not our problem.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.216
Does he have a locker here
or a room, anything?

09:45.218 --> 09:46.551
I'll give you
his stuff,

09:46.553 --> 09:48.553
but you got to promise me
protection.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.121
Really? From who?

09:50.123 --> 09:52.390
The blacks who are gonna
come after us.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.694
Your whole thing seems to be
about how tough you are.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.761
What you need us for?

09:56.763 --> 10:00.365
We provide a service
to this community.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.934
We pay rent, we pay taxes.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.836
The local precinct
has a duty to protect us.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.938
I'm not asking for anything on
the arm here, just what's due.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.740
"On the arm"?

10:08.742 --> 10:09.908
For free.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.976
I know what it means.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.243
How do you know what it means?

10:12.245 --> 10:15.814
Nine years on the job,
last six at the 4-4.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.150
Wow.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.585
And so...

10:20.587 --> 10:23.755
now you're, what, some kind
of white rights vigilante?

10:23.757 --> 10:27.659
No. Now I'm free
of all the PC crap,

10:27.661 --> 10:29.728
the civil rights crap,

10:29.730 --> 10:32.697
the community relations crap.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.966
Now I'm free
to actually do the job.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.235
Getting rid of
the blacks and browns?

10:37.237 --> 10:38.570
Just the gangs.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.005
Right.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.973
Just happens that they come
in those colors.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.509
I didn't make it that way.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.547
He crashed in the room
in the back.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.684
His stuff
would be there.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.292
It was a hazing thing
on a pledge,

11:01.294 --> 11:03.234
and Janko was kind of
the innocent bystander.

11:03.258 --> 11:04.096
How so?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.164
Well, if a pledge was hooking up
in one of the rooms

11:06.166 --> 11:08.066
during a party, it was
a thing to snatch the girl

11:08.068 --> 11:11.002
and kind of... parade her
around the house.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.838
And Eddie was the girl?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.407
Yeah.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.542
And I'm guessing, when you would
snatch up one of these girls,

11:17.544 --> 11:18.610
they'd be naked.
Yeah.

11:18.612 --> 11:19.678
That would be the point.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.812
Yeah.
Right.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.614
So you marched Eddie
around the house?

11:22.616 --> 11:23.748
Not me. Another brother.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.949
But you were there?

11:24.951 --> 11:25.884
Yes, obviously.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.652
And you did nothing.
Look, man,

11:27.654 --> 11:29.387
it was pretty common.
She just blew it up.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.623
At any rate, it's hardly fair
that I'm, like, in jail for it.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.692
- Let's not talk about fair, okay?
- No, let's.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.894
She's using her cop status
to get back at me.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.429
Says you.
Come on, man.

11:37.431 --> 11:40.532
Look, it was, like,
ten, 11 years ago.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.136
Yeah, well, maybe not to her.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.538
She bring charges?

11:46.540 --> 11:47.672
There was
an administration review.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.474
We were told to put an end
to the practice.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.142
Oh, hard time, huh?

11:51.144 --> 11:53.511
Look, man, okay?

11:53.513 --> 11:54.846
I own a bar.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.581
I could lose my liquor license
over this.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.450
That's probably a good thing.
Maybe a frat boy like you

11:58.452 --> 11:59.517
shouldn't be serving liquor.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.386
I get to call
a lawyer yet?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.354
Hey, whoa, whoa. Come on, come
on, come on. Where you going?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.056
Talk to the desk sergeant.
About what?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.092
About getting justice
for frat boys like you.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.126
I want a lawyer!

12:08.128 --> 12:10.061
Tell your
arresting officer!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.730
Damn it!

12:11.732 --> 12:14.933
Their website says
Real Samaritans has branches

12:14.935 --> 12:16.367
in Chicago, Miami and L.A.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.369
Makes sense.
You're in the gang business,

12:18.371 --> 12:20.071
you go where
the gangs are, right?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.607
Detective Reagan,
you got a visitor.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.609
You hang on a second.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.479
Wow. This has
to be a first.

12:27.481 --> 12:28.980
How's that?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.515
You're in a squad room
without handcuffs on.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.150
Did you toss him?
Yes, sir.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.119
Meet Tyrell Green,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.521
head dirtbag
of the Get Cash Boyz.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.555
Pleasure.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.857
How can I help you, sir?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.192
We need to talk about these
Real Samaritan dudes, homie.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.794
What do you mean,
"We need to talk"?

12:42.796 --> 12:44.462
We, we. What are you gonna do?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.064
They done killed
that old man.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.434
They're stone-cold racists
in my turf.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.602
I'm sorry,
did I miss something?

12:50.604 --> 12:52.337
Is this old man
your daddy or something?

12:52.339 --> 12:53.905
He the whole hood's daddy.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.640
Look, stay away
from them, okay?

12:55.642 --> 12:57.509
Nah, I can't do that.
That's my neighborhoody-hood.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.043
It's your neighborhood
where you deal drugs

12:59.045 --> 13:00.345
and you extort
shop owners.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.348
No, man, listen,
I have turned a whole new leap.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.185
- I think you mean "a new leaf."
- That part.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.820
Get the hell
out of here, Tyrell.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.889
And if you go
near those guys,

13:10.891 --> 13:13.124
it's gonna be a bus ticket
back upstate for you.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.126
Look, seriously, man,
y'all supposed to be

13:15.128 --> 13:16.227
protecting the neighborhood.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.496
I mean, if you ain't
gonna do your job,

13:18.498 --> 13:22.801
why don't you just step aside
and let somebody else step up?

13:25.538 --> 13:28.706
If I need a civics lesson,
I'll let you know next time.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.074
Get him out of here.

13:30.076 --> 13:33.077
Tell the commissioner
to keep up the bad work.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.980
I will.
Yeah, I bet you will.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.453
What?

13:42.455 --> 13:43.788
What "what"?

13:43.790 --> 13:45.323
It's something.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.325
Just what he said
about stepping up.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.395
It... it just sounds like
it could be a quote

13:50.397 --> 13:52.463
from any one
of my family members

13:52.465 --> 13:54.699
at any one Sunday dinner.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.734
That's what.

14:08.137 --> 14:10.337
Somebody
dropped a dime on me.

14:10.339 --> 14:11.972
You know it and I know it.

14:11.974 --> 14:14.942
19 years on the job,
never been tested till now?

14:14.944 --> 14:17.277
No way that happens
without somebody tipping IAB

14:17.279 --> 14:18.545
where I was at.

14:18.547 --> 14:20.547
You mean up on Buzz Mountain?
Come on.

14:20.549 --> 14:22.950
You really think
we're gonna go down this road?

14:22.952 --> 14:24.751
Yes, you should
look into it.

14:24.753 --> 14:26.653
Look into it
for what, Devin?

14:26.655 --> 14:28.655
One of your trainees thinks
you're too tough on him

14:28.657 --> 14:29.923
and wants to
crack you back?

14:29.925 --> 14:32.092
That line goes
around the block.

14:32.094 --> 14:33.961
You tested positive,
fair and square.

14:33.963 --> 14:35.862
For something
that was legal where I used it.

14:35.864 --> 14:37.230
Enough.

14:42.136 --> 14:45.339
I've known you a long time, so
I know you're better than this.

14:45.341 --> 14:47.674
There's no quality judgments
to be made.

14:47.676 --> 14:51.178
Somebody wants to drop a dime
on you for whatever reason,

14:51.180 --> 14:53.213
it's their dime to
spend. Quit whining.

14:53.215 --> 14:54.681
I'm defending myself.

14:54.683 --> 14:57.584
Okay. Let's say
someone did tip off IAB.

14:57.586 --> 14:59.920
Are you telling me
that somehow they knew

14:59.922 --> 15:03.323
this was the one and only time
you got high?

15:03.325 --> 15:05.092
No.

15:05.094 --> 15:06.860
Then shut up about it.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.595
You smoke weed, right?

15:08.597 --> 15:11.832
Please, don't ask me that.
Okay, how's this?

15:11.834 --> 15:15.135
Fair to say this wasn't
the first time you inhaled?

15:15.137 --> 15:17.704
It was an edible,
a legal edible.

15:17.706 --> 15:19.206
Oh, and cut that out.

15:19.208 --> 15:20.774
You drink whiskey?

15:20.776 --> 15:22.009
Whiskey's legal.

15:22.011 --> 15:24.378
My grandson's hamster
could make that argument.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.546
So was the edible that I had.

15:26.548 --> 15:27.681
The point is,

15:27.683 --> 15:28.682
we have stressful jobs,

15:28.684 --> 15:30.117
sometimes you need
something to relax.

15:30.119 --> 15:31.218
Ah, come on, Devin.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.186
Drinking never agreed with me.

15:37.258 --> 15:38.959
Come clean.

15:38.961 --> 15:42.329
Admit you screwed up
and fall on the mercy.

15:42.331 --> 15:43.930
Or what?

15:43.932 --> 15:45.565
I get terminated?

15:45.567 --> 15:48.001
A punk on the street
gets told to put it out,

15:48.003 --> 15:50.237
but a decorated cop
goes under a bus?

15:53.107 --> 15:58.812
Devin, you really want to become
the mayor's political football?

15:58.814 --> 16:04.051
You really want <i>this</i> to be
your legacy of service?

16:07.088 --> 16:08.955
The <i>Times</i> has called
five times and...

16:08.957 --> 16:10.424
Stall them.
This is raw meat.

16:10.426 --> 16:13.427
If you don't have a basket
of IOUs from these guys,

16:13.429 --> 16:14.995
you're not doing your job right.

16:14.997 --> 16:16.463
Stall them.

16:30.411 --> 16:33.080
So, how do you want
to play this?

16:33.082 --> 16:34.748
Straight, but cutting
her some slack.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.050
Not sure slack's
gonna cut it.

16:37.052 --> 16:38.285
Playing it by ear, then?

16:38.287 --> 16:39.286
Hey.

16:39.288 --> 16:41.054
Hey.
Hey.

16:41.056 --> 16:42.622
Hey.

16:46.494 --> 16:49.029
Uh, hope you don't mind
if my sister joins us.

16:49.031 --> 16:50.497
Uh, not at all.

16:50.499 --> 16:51.698
It's long overdue.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.667
Uh, excuse me?

16:53.669 --> 16:56.303
Can I get an Irish whiskey,
one cube, please?

16:56.305 --> 16:58.371
So, what's going on?

16:58.373 --> 17:00.240
What's that mean?

17:00.242 --> 17:03.009
Well, Erin's not just here,
is she?

17:03.011 --> 17:06.880
I asked Erin to join us.

17:08.382 --> 17:09.715
Jamie called me

17:09.718 --> 17:11.484
for advice,

17:11.487 --> 17:13.686
and I advised him
to issue the prisoner

17:13.689 --> 17:16.189
a desk appearance ticket
for the obscure charge

17:16.191 --> 17:17.824
and to release him.

17:17.826 --> 17:19.992
And you did it?

17:19.994 --> 17:20.993
Yeah.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.829
How?

17:24.665 --> 17:27.467
I talked to the desk sergeant,
and he assigned me the collar.

17:29.537 --> 17:32.172
So, what,
you're like his muscle?

17:32.174 --> 17:33.373
No, just the A.D.A.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.775
trying to keep the two of you
out of a jam.

17:35.777 --> 17:38.211
By letting Fuller walk?

17:38.213 --> 17:40.814
Fuller did something terrible,
from what I understand,

17:40.816 --> 17:42.215
but he didn't do it yesterday

17:42.217 --> 17:44.251
and he didn't do it
in New York City.

17:44.253 --> 17:46.586
You understand how?

17:46.588 --> 17:47.854
I talked to him

17:47.856 --> 17:51.691
in his holding cell;
he told me what happened.

17:51.693 --> 17:53.693
That must've been brutal, Eddie.

17:55.930 --> 17:59.032
Did he tell you that
he posted pictures as well?

18:00.735 --> 18:02.235
No.

18:04.705 --> 18:06.540
Thanks.

18:06.542 --> 18:09.409
Yeah, not only did he not
do anything to help me

18:09.411 --> 18:11.244
when it happened,
but he saw to it

18:11.246 --> 18:14.681
that the humiliation
went on and on.

18:14.683 --> 18:17.350
I'm really sorry about that.

18:17.352 --> 18:19.886
But if you testify to
the trumped-up charges,

18:19.888 --> 18:22.689
the only way it would stick
is if you perjured yourself.

18:22.691 --> 18:25.859
You ever had naked pictures
of yourself posted online?

18:25.861 --> 18:28.128
No.

18:28.130 --> 18:29.462
Tend to forget
the legal niceties

18:29.464 --> 18:31.198
when you think about the person
that did that to you.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.899
I can imagine.

18:32.901 --> 18:34.701
You know, I never had
any complaints

18:34.703 --> 18:36.203
about my boobs or my ass,

18:36.205 --> 18:38.972
but that's because
I got to choose who saw them.

18:40.708 --> 18:42.876
He took that choice
away from me.

18:42.878 --> 18:45.378
Eddie, I'm really sorry
that that happened,

18:45.380 --> 18:46.646
but you can't get your payback

18:46.648 --> 18:48.782
by pressing false charges
against him.

18:57.992 --> 18:59.726
This on you guys?

18:59.728 --> 19:01.228
Thanks.

19:05.533 --> 19:07.801
♪

19:16.611 --> 19:20.313
These guys don't get to qualify
their racism by saying

19:20.315 --> 19:21.948
it's just the gangs
they're racist about.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.583
Believe me, I'm not
saying they do.

19:23.585 --> 19:25.318
I mean, they're
still just racist.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.953
Yes, they are.

19:26.955 --> 19:30.090
And normally, you'd say that
if Green were to off him,

19:30.092 --> 19:33.093
it'd be a community
service homicide.

19:33.095 --> 19:35.328
And I still do say it'd be
a community service homicide

19:35.330 --> 19:36.796
if the guy getting offed
wasn't a cop.

19:36.798 --> 19:38.298
Ex-cop.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.800
And that's my point.

19:40.802 --> 19:43.536
What's the limit on what
the shield shields you from?

19:43.538 --> 19:44.804
Come on,
don't get me wrong here.

19:44.806 --> 19:47.474
I don't agree with anything
this guy stands for.

19:47.476 --> 19:48.508
That's good to hear.

19:50.979 --> 19:53.780
Look, I have time before I go
to my old man's for dinner.

19:53.782 --> 19:55.815
Would you like to get
a drink or something?

19:55.817 --> 19:57.150
Sure.

19:58.953 --> 20:01.421
Son of a bitch.
What?

20:01.423 --> 20:04.424
Pitney just offed one of
the Get Cash Boyz in Rikers

20:04.426 --> 20:05.592
20 minutes ago.

20:05.594 --> 20:07.727
That cracker's got
some death wish.

20:07.729 --> 20:09.162
Who you calling?

20:09.164 --> 20:11.498
Word's gonna travel fast.
There's gonna be trouble.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.099
Detective Reagan
of Major Case.

20:13.101 --> 20:16.403
Need a sector car to respond
to 1675 Jamaica Avenue.

20:16.405 --> 20:17.871
I'm on my way.

20:17.873 --> 20:19.706
Let's go.

20:34.021 --> 20:35.555
Ah, son of a bitch.

20:35.557 --> 20:37.857
Hey, welcome to
the after-party, Detectives.

20:37.859 --> 20:39.326
What do we got?

20:39.328 --> 20:40.560
Just a burglary.

20:40.562 --> 20:42.295
Criminal mis, no vics.

20:42.297 --> 20:45.165
And, uh, somebody peed
on the banner.

20:45.167 --> 20:46.266
Somebody what?
Yeah.

20:46.268 --> 20:47.567
Can you get DNA off of pee?

20:47.569 --> 20:48.968
I don't think

20:48.970 --> 20:51.037
it's a very good source.
Is it okay I don't bag it?

20:51.039 --> 20:53.840
It might tell you it was
males or females who did this.

20:53.842 --> 20:55.542
You mean we have
to bag it?

20:55.544 --> 20:58.011
Let's assume it was males, okay?
We're not bagging the pee.

20:58.013 --> 21:00.780
There's a router
and a laser printer gone, too.

21:00.782 --> 21:03.316
Wow, just in the nick of time.

21:03.318 --> 21:04.584
What'd you see?

21:04.586 --> 21:07.687
Half a dozen black guys
taking off with our stuff.

21:07.689 --> 21:09.322
- - Okay, can you I.D. any of 'em?
Yeah.

21:09.324 --> 21:11.858
Maybe if you had a mug
shot of their backs!

21:11.860 --> 21:14.461
Take it easy, all right?
We're here to help.

21:14.463 --> 21:15.895
Yeah, the hell you are.

21:16.697 --> 21:18.264
You let this happen.
This is on you.

21:18.266 --> 21:20.433
Hey, hey!
Take it easy with the bat

21:20.435 --> 21:23.370
or you're gonna have
a bigger problem than this mess!

21:23.372 --> 21:25.705
I mean, what the hell
did you think was gonna happen?

21:25.707 --> 21:28.375
You move into a predominantly
black neighborhood

21:28.377 --> 21:30.243
and practically put up a sign
saying "whites only."

21:30.245 --> 21:32.612
We go where the business is.
Really?

21:32.614 --> 21:34.514
Well, your boy Duane
just killed a local banger

21:34.516 --> 21:35.648
in Rikers an hour ago.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.050
I told you, he's not my boy.

21:37.052 --> 21:38.118
You know, maybe it's time

21:38.120 --> 21:39.919
you moved to a new
neighborhood, huh?

21:44.725 --> 21:46.926
I'll ask your C.O.
to have a sector car

21:46.928 --> 21:49.729
pay special attention to
this place the next few days.

21:49.731 --> 21:51.097
He's black, too, Detective.

21:51.099 --> 21:53.733
I'm asking anyways.

21:53.735 --> 21:54.834
Okay?

21:54.836 --> 21:56.403
Copy that.

22:02.176 --> 22:03.977
Come down to
the squad room tomorrow,

22:03.979 --> 22:05.278
look at some photos, okay?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.980
Look, I told you
I just saw their backs.

22:06.982 --> 22:08.348
Maybe there's some guys
I like for it,

22:08.350 --> 22:10.049
maybe you seen 'em around.

22:10.051 --> 22:11.651
I'm sure I have.

22:11.653 --> 22:13.653
You're kind of missing
the point of me.

22:13.655 --> 22:14.821
What's the point of you?

22:14.823 --> 22:17.123
I'm done trying
to run the zoo your way.

22:17.125 --> 22:18.191
Doesn't work.

22:18.193 --> 22:20.226
So, what, there's
a new sheriff in town?

22:20.228 --> 22:22.729
Hmm? One that carries
a baseball bat?

22:22.731 --> 22:26.699
I still have my carry permit
and weapon as a last resort.

22:28.202 --> 22:30.003
Okay, Wyatt Earp.

22:47.081 --> 22:50.450
Oh, come on, I'm not gonna
go around the table,

22:50.452 --> 22:52.719
but I think
it's safe to assume that,

22:52.721 --> 22:56.022
other than me and Pop,
everyone has had experience

22:56.024 --> 22:58.058
with marijuana.

23:00.227 --> 23:01.828
Copy.

23:02.663 --> 23:04.364
Good with.

23:07.334 --> 23:09.335
Understood.

23:11.338 --> 23:13.339
Not so fast.

23:16.610 --> 23:18.211
Seriously?

23:20.715 --> 23:23.083
Mm-hmm.

23:23.085 --> 23:25.885
I used to hang out
backstage

23:25.887 --> 23:27.687
at the Half Note and
the Village Vanguard.

23:27.689 --> 23:29.422
Off-duty, of course.
Of course.

23:29.424 --> 23:30.590
And when Dizzy

23:30.592 --> 23:32.092
or Sonny

23:32.094 --> 23:36.329
or Miles offer you a reefer,
you don't say no, do you?

23:36.331 --> 23:37.831
Apparently not.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.966
- Peer pressure?
- It was a long time ago.

23:39.968 --> 23:43.203
And we didn't have any
random drug tests back then.

23:44.038 --> 23:45.772
Never?

23:47.274 --> 23:48.608
Come on, Dad.

23:48.610 --> 23:49.943
Yeah, come on, Dad.

23:49.945 --> 23:52.278
Honest.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.881
It kind of started out as a bet.

23:54.883 --> 23:57.550
Your grandpa offered me
500 bucks if I'd wait

23:57.552 --> 23:58.651
till I was 21.

23:58.653 --> 24:00.453
Yeah, and after
you turned 21?

24:00.455 --> 24:02.122
I got the 500 bucks.

24:02.124 --> 24:03.389
But by then, I'd seen

24:03.391 --> 24:05.925
such stupid stuff
hanging out with my friends,

24:05.927 --> 24:08.394
I... it just didn't have
any appeal.

24:08.396 --> 24:09.662
Honest.

24:09.664 --> 24:10.730
You never told me that.

24:10.732 --> 24:13.633
Well, you never told me <i>that!</i>

24:15.536 --> 24:19.739
One thing the chief said sticks.

24:19.741 --> 24:22.442
Departmental policy says
I have to terminate him,

24:22.444 --> 24:25.645
but if he was just
Citizen Jones,

24:25.647 --> 24:28.948
smoking a joint in the park,
departmental practice for a cop

24:28.950 --> 24:31.951
would be to just
tell him to ditch it.

24:31.953 --> 24:33.319
Pretty much.

24:33.321 --> 24:34.821
I hate to say it,

24:34.823 --> 24:36.122
but it doesn't seem right.

24:36.124 --> 24:37.323
We actually have

24:37.325 --> 24:38.324
an office pool--

24:38.326 --> 24:40.059
which A.D.A. will
become the test case

24:40.061 --> 24:42.996
for a random drug test
that shows positive

24:42.998 --> 24:44.697
for pot they
bought legally.

24:44.699 --> 24:47.634
Some would say
our departments are lagging

24:47.636 --> 24:50.270
behind the citizens we're
supposed to protect and serve.

24:50.272 --> 24:52.272
But the authority
we have is partly because

24:52.274 --> 24:53.439
we're held to
a stricter standard.

24:53.441 --> 24:54.774
But any wink you show

24:54.776 --> 24:58.378
that marijuana possession is
less than what the law says,

24:58.380 --> 25:01.581
well, you open
a huge can of worms.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.683
I know, but can't
you just let the chief

25:03.685 --> 25:05.785
fall on his own sword
for the short term?

25:05.787 --> 25:07.120
How do you mean?

25:07.122 --> 25:08.955
Make a show until
this thing blows over,

25:08.957 --> 25:11.891
and then, once it blows
over, you bring him back.

25:11.893 --> 25:13.626
And let every single
one of the rank and file go,

25:13.628 --> 25:17.297
"Oh, the system's rigged,
unless you're the boss."

25:17.299 --> 25:19.799
Speaking on behalf of the
rank and file, you're right.

25:19.801 --> 25:21.100
You know how else

25:21.102 --> 25:23.469
I know we're talking
about a double standard?

25:23.471 --> 25:25.471
How?

25:25.473 --> 25:27.473
I keep thinking
maybe we shouldn't bring this up

25:27.475 --> 25:29.442
in front of the kids
at Sunday dinner.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.247
Good idea.

25:41.889 --> 25:43.323
Anything?

25:43.325 --> 25:45.725
For the tenth time,
I saw these guys' backs

25:45.727 --> 25:48.161
from a half block away at night.

25:48.163 --> 25:50.363
Great. Let's just take
another look at these.

25:52.199 --> 25:53.933
The Get Cash Boyz.

25:53.935 --> 25:56.069
So you <i>can</i> I.D. them.

25:56.071 --> 25:57.804
In that I know who they are.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.306
It's part of the reason
I'm in the neighborhood I am.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.141
I can't put them
at the scene.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.010
Well, I know that
they took an interest

26:04.012 --> 26:05.678
in your little outfit.

26:05.680 --> 26:10.350
Look, I know what you're trying
to do, and I'm not playing.

26:10.352 --> 26:12.518
And when I get them,

26:12.520 --> 26:16.022
it'll be by rights
or by righteous force.

26:16.024 --> 26:18.291
Can I ask you something?

26:18.293 --> 26:20.894
How'd you go from being
on the job to this?

26:20.896 --> 26:22.662
This?
This dog-whistle

26:22.664 --> 26:24.764
racist thing you're all about.

26:26.634 --> 26:28.534
The job itself did this.

26:28.536 --> 26:31.070
The job ordered me
not to profile

26:31.072 --> 26:33.273
these animals.

26:33.275 --> 26:36.009
Not to stop and frisk
and, God knows how,

26:36.011 --> 26:37.543
presume that they're innocent.

26:39.046 --> 26:41.648
Came a day
I couldn't stomach it.

26:41.650 --> 26:45.818
But I respected the uniform,
so I took it off.

26:45.820 --> 26:48.421
Now I can call a spade a spade.

26:49.890 --> 26:50.957
Cute.

26:50.959 --> 26:52.358
You asked.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.394
You know, not for nothing,

26:54.396 --> 26:56.562
but everybody on the job
gets jaded.

26:57.731 --> 27:01.067
You can still keep your sense
of good judgment, though.

27:03.337 --> 27:06.572
Good judgment is
exactly what I have.

27:16.216 --> 27:18.184
How many times
I got to say it, Reagan?

27:18.186 --> 27:20.219
I don't want to talk about it.
Neither do I.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.955
Then what are you doing
skulking around out here?

27:21.957 --> 27:24.857
I did what I had to do, but
I'm sorry I had to, okay?

27:24.859 --> 27:25.858
Oh, whatever.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.627
Could you just accept
the apology?

27:27.629 --> 27:30.396
What do you want, a receipt?

27:30.398 --> 27:32.131
What are you doing here?
You walked.

27:32.133 --> 27:33.466
- I know.
- Then keep walking.

27:33.468 --> 27:35.101
I owe you an apology
that's long overdue.

27:35.103 --> 27:35.961
Oh, spare me.

27:35.985 --> 27:37.977
I'm sorry for what I did
and what I didn't do.

27:38.106 --> 27:40.707
I'm ashamed of myself,
and I'm sorry.

27:40.709 --> 27:42.342
That it?

27:42.344 --> 27:45.578
Uh, well, I own a bar.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.714
It's a nice place--
good food, good people.

27:47.716 --> 27:51.150
You can eat and drink
for free anytime you want.

27:51.152 --> 27:53.920
The sad part is
I think that that

27:53.922 --> 27:56.656
works for you, and I think
that that always has.

27:56.658 --> 27:58.624
What, apologizing?

27:58.626 --> 28:00.727
Whatever you do, in the end,

28:00.729 --> 28:02.528
you know you're gonna
get away with it.

28:02.530 --> 28:03.496
No, that's not true.

28:03.498 --> 28:04.764
Oh, give me
a break, Skippy.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.466
You got the perfect gene pool

28:06.468 --> 28:07.767
and the private schools

28:07.769 --> 28:09.969
and the stupid little
whales on your belts

28:09.971 --> 28:12.538
and your ties,
and you got it made.

28:12.540 --> 28:15.174
I half-own a bar, Janko.
I'm not exactly a success story.

28:15.176 --> 28:16.542
Whatever you do,
there's gonna be

28:16.544 --> 28:18.945
an army of people out there
going, "Oh, Skip Fuller,

28:18.947 --> 28:20.046
"he's good people.

28:20.048 --> 28:22.482
"Great family,
all the right schools.

28:22.484 --> 28:23.950
Boys will be boys."

28:23.952 --> 28:25.351
You don't know me at all.

28:25.353 --> 28:28.454
Stay out of my sight.

28:39.334 --> 28:41.134
Yes.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.137
She invited me to dinner
at Gracie Mansion, and I went.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.039
Good talk?

28:46.041 --> 28:47.440
Any results?

28:47.442 --> 28:49.509
She offered me
a position, in case

28:49.511 --> 28:51.477
this conflict results
in my being terminated

28:51.479 --> 28:52.512
from the department.

28:52.514 --> 28:53.679
What position?

28:53.681 --> 28:54.981
Minister of Ganja?

28:54.983 --> 28:56.749
Sid.
Sorry.

28:56.751 --> 28:59.385
With the implication that
you will endorse legalization?

28:59.387 --> 29:00.686
Didn't come up.

29:00.688 --> 29:01.821
Come on, Devin,
you're a smart guy.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.791
She didn't ask me
not to speak my mind.

29:04.793 --> 29:05.992
So, what's the post?

29:05.994 --> 29:06.993
Deputy Commissioner,

29:06.995 --> 29:08.361
New York City
Emergency Management.

29:12.232 --> 29:14.367
You'll be a good fit.

29:14.369 --> 29:17.103
I would be, or I will be?

29:17.105 --> 29:19.672
Devin, I can't let this slide.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.874
And I shouldn't have to
tell you about leadership.

29:21.876 --> 29:23.109
You can't
ask your troops

29:23.111 --> 29:25.812
to follow an order you
don't follow yourself.

29:25.814 --> 29:27.447
Straw poll says
the troops don't give a hoot

29:27.449 --> 29:29.449
about keeping weed a crime.
That could be,

29:29.451 --> 29:31.818
but the number-one job
of this department

29:31.820 --> 29:35.721
is to make sure
the laws are upheld.

29:35.723 --> 29:37.924
So my hands are tied.

29:37.926 --> 29:39.292
You could be a voice of reason.

29:39.294 --> 29:42.261
No one ever hired me
for my voice.

29:43.363 --> 29:45.665
That's it?

29:45.667 --> 29:49.502
If you can't meet me
at least halfway,

29:49.504 --> 29:52.738
all I can do is say
thank you for your service.

29:58.745 --> 30:01.981
♪

30:06.253 --> 30:08.621
I'm Michael Goldman,
referred by the ACLU.

30:08.623 --> 30:10.389
I've been assigned
to represent Duane Pitney

30:10.391 --> 30:11.491
in the Rikers murder.

30:11.493 --> 30:13.526
Talk about
your short straws.

30:13.528 --> 30:15.161
Actually, I relish
the opportunity.

30:15.163 --> 30:16.496
Testing the mettle.

30:16.498 --> 30:19.098
Good luck with that.
What do you want from us?

30:19.100 --> 30:20.700
I'm here because,
in my discovery, I've learned

30:20.702 --> 30:22.735
that there's a group
called Real Samaritans

30:22.737 --> 30:24.003
who've come under attack

30:24.005 --> 30:26.105
because of Pitney's
relationship with them.

30:26.107 --> 30:28.241
They say Pitney was
just passing through.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.809
But the police report
named them

30:29.811 --> 30:31.944
and gave their address in
conjunction with Pitney's case.

30:31.946 --> 30:34.080
The PR desk is downtown.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.717
Yeah, fair warning,
if you do not take steps

30:37.719 --> 30:40.853
to insure the safe exercise
of their First Amendment rights,

30:40.855 --> 30:43.289
I will be recommending
a civil suit against the NYPD

30:43.291 --> 30:44.624
on their behalf.

30:44.626 --> 30:46.692
Well, consider us warned.

30:46.694 --> 30:48.227
I'm serious, Detective.

30:48.229 --> 30:50.763
I know who you are,
I know who your father is.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.933
You trying to threaten me
here, Mr. Goldman?

30:53.935 --> 30:55.468
Not at all.

30:55.470 --> 30:57.703
Just setting the table for you.

30:57.705 --> 30:59.572
Good evening, Detectives.

30:59.574 --> 31:01.274
Mm-hmm.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.975
Some nerve, huh?

31:02.977 --> 31:04.210
Yeah.

31:04.212 --> 31:06.779
But with an irritating
little kernel of truth to it.

31:23.530 --> 31:24.664
Hey!

31:24.666 --> 31:26.265
What the hell's going on here?

31:26.267 --> 31:28.467
- We're going out on rounds.
- "On rounds"?

31:28.469 --> 31:30.336
That's funny, 'cause I thought
you said you were all, uh,

31:30.338 --> 31:32.638
anti-gang.
We're not a gang.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.106
You're not a gang?

31:34.108 --> 31:35.975
Well, that's interesting.
'Cause when I see a bunch

31:35.977 --> 31:39.212
of lookalike, dress-alike
dirtbags carrying pipes

31:39.214 --> 31:42.215
and bats and sticks and such,

31:42.217 --> 31:44.383
I see a gang.

31:44.385 --> 31:45.585
We're a force for good.

31:45.587 --> 31:47.186
No. You're everything
you claim to hate,

31:47.188 --> 31:50.122
only you're too stupid
to see it.

31:53.193 --> 31:56.028
Come on, Kyle.
You were a cop.

31:56.030 --> 31:59.999
Walk in those shoes again
for a second.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.867
You know I can't
back you up,

32:01.869 --> 32:03.636
and you know
I'm not gonna protect you.

32:03.638 --> 32:06.138
We don't count
on you anymore.

32:06.140 --> 32:09.342
And neither do any of the
other right-minded citizens.

32:11.379 --> 32:13.679
Ready?

32:13.681 --> 32:15.248
This is it.

32:15.250 --> 32:16.949
This happens now.

32:23.657 --> 32:24.924
Come on.

32:39.690 --> 32:41.658
Hey, white piece of bread, yo.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.493
How many times
you been warned?

32:43.495 --> 32:44.827
Could ask you
the same thing.

32:44.829 --> 32:47.063
Yo, this Brooklyn.
We own all of this here.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.132
Why don't you climb
back into those trees.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.533
These are our streets now.

32:50.535 --> 32:51.901
You calling me a monkey?

32:51.903 --> 32:52.935
Yeah.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.771
- And you just...
- Tyrell Green!

32:58.842 --> 33:01.044
Step away.
Over there.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.012
Tyrell Green,

33:03.014 --> 33:06.115
I've observed
you operating a motor vehicle

33:06.117 --> 33:08.117
with inoperable taillights.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.255
I've also became suspicious
that some of the individuals

33:12.257 --> 33:13.923
in your company

33:13.925 --> 33:16.659
may have felony records,
which, as you and I both know,

33:16.661 --> 33:20.196
consorting with known felons
is a violation of your parole,

33:20.198 --> 33:22.165
a violation which will
send you right back to prison

33:22.167 --> 33:24.600
if you don't
get the hell out of here.

33:24.602 --> 33:27.570
Oh, man, you on that
bull shiesty, right?

33:27.572 --> 33:31.374
Get out of here before
I change my mind, okay, Tyrell?

33:32.943 --> 33:34.243
Come on.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.478
Yo.

33:42.686 --> 33:45.288
Better work on your tan
around these parts.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.557
Come on.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.761
Fix that taillight.

33:54.031 --> 33:56.699
Kyle Wentworth. Hey!

33:56.701 --> 34:00.403
We don't have stand-your-ground
statutes here in New York City.

34:00.405 --> 34:03.740
Yet I've observed
you and your friends

34:03.742 --> 34:06.442
acting in a very
threatening manner,

34:06.444 --> 34:08.911
armed with implements

34:08.913 --> 34:13.081
that could well be used
as dangerous weapons.

34:13.083 --> 34:16.619
Your boy Duane's
in protective custody

34:16.621 --> 34:18.920
for killing one of his boys.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.422
Should you end
up in Rikers,

34:20.425 --> 34:22.592
well, your ass
would be a sweet replacement,

34:22.594 --> 34:25.628
if you get what
I'm saying.

34:25.630 --> 34:29.197
Now, get the hell inside, start
making travel arrangements.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.234
All of you.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.969
Come on.

34:53.857 --> 34:55.725
Take a seat.

34:57.528 --> 35:00.296
I wanted to come
and personally thank you

35:00.298 --> 35:03.666
for reaching out during
this challenging time for me.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.868
And?

35:07.938 --> 35:10.039
That's all.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.741
No, that can't be all.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.044
I've got two reporters
from the <i>Times</i> metro desk

35:15.046 --> 35:16.746
on their way in here.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.614
Madam Mayor,
we came here as a courtesy,

35:18.616 --> 35:22.084
but also to stress that
this is a departmental matter,

35:22.086 --> 35:24.487
and we'd prefer
to keep it that way.

35:24.489 --> 35:25.922
Is he still fired?

35:25.924 --> 35:27.657
Chief?

35:27.659 --> 35:31.060
After some candid
and invigorating discussions

35:31.062 --> 35:32.495
with the commissioner,

35:32.497 --> 35:34.230
we agreed on
the course of action

35:34.232 --> 35:37.934
which both sets the right
example for rank and file,

35:37.936 --> 35:41.671
while allowing me to reset
and then resume my duties.

35:41.673 --> 35:45.007
Why does he sound like he's
reading from a teleprompter?

35:45.009 --> 35:46.943
- He doesn't.
- I'm not.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.278
What's the course of action?

35:49.280 --> 35:50.480
A period of suspension.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.547
Define "period."

35:51.549 --> 35:53.449
A length or portion of time.

35:53.451 --> 35:55.751
I meant how long?

35:55.753 --> 35:56.819
That's TBD.

35:56.821 --> 35:57.954
TBD. What else?

35:57.956 --> 35:59.789
Outpatient rehab.
So, what?

35:59.791 --> 36:03.192
He has to watch <i>Reefer Madness</i>
all the way through?

36:05.229 --> 36:07.029
I'm not buying
any of this, Frank.

36:07.031 --> 36:09.799
Also, mandatory drug tests,
going forward.

36:09.801 --> 36:13.636
Where you get a mandatory
heads-up a week before.

36:13.638 --> 36:14.904
We came here as a courtesy.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.073
I would appreciate courtesy
in kind.

36:18.809 --> 36:21.744
As difficult as it is
in this instance,

36:21.746 --> 36:24.614
it is my duty
to enforce the laws

36:24.616 --> 36:27.717
governing marijuana use
by our officers

36:27.719 --> 36:29.318
with the same diligence

36:29.320 --> 36:31.721
with which we enforce it
on the public.

36:31.723 --> 36:35.558
Smoke and mirrors, that's
what you're giving me, Frank.

36:36.393 --> 36:38.494
Good day, Madam Mayor.

36:46.537 --> 36:50.907
I wanted to thank you again
for your support.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.843
Meant a lot to me.

37:07.224 --> 37:08.357
You're gonna say
it eventually.

37:08.359 --> 37:09.926
Might as well just
get it over with.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.761
Nope.
"Reagan, I got to admit,

37:11.763 --> 37:13.462
you had my back
on this one""

37:13.464 --> 37:15.865
Nope.
"Hate to say it, but I owe you one."

37:15.867 --> 37:17.133
Not happening.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.135
12-David, we have a 10-34,

37:19.137 --> 37:20.469
assault in progress,

37:20.471 --> 37:23.205
1954 Eighth Avenue.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.474
Central, 12-David,
show us responding.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.021
Whoa, whoa.
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:39.023 --> 37:41.657
Whoa, whoa! Hey.

37:41.659 --> 37:42.758
Face the wall, face the wall.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.993
I'm going in, Jamie.

37:46.029 --> 37:48.197
Out of the way. Move. Move.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.699
Move!

37:51.602 --> 37:53.569
What happened?
These douche bags

37:53.571 --> 37:55.037
were hitting on us,
and they started

37:55.039 --> 37:56.205
grabbing our boobs
and stuff,

37:56.207 --> 37:57.473
so the bartender,
like, stepped in.

37:57.475 --> 38:00.176
Then they started just,
like, whaling on him.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.612
Central, 12-David. We need a bus
at this location, forthwith.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.547
Does anyone have a rag?

38:04.549 --> 38:06.048
Thank you.

38:06.050 --> 38:08.351
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

38:08.353 --> 38:10.586
All right.

38:14.691 --> 38:16.058
Skip?

38:17.861 --> 38:19.362
Eddie?

38:20.764 --> 38:22.765
Did you set this up?

38:22.767 --> 38:25.101
Oh-- oh, no.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.102
No, no, no.

38:26.104 --> 38:29.705
Well, that's good to hear.

38:29.707 --> 38:31.540
I think my ribs are busted.

38:31.542 --> 38:33.843
We got an ambulance on the way,
so stay still.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.045
I stepped up.

38:37.247 --> 38:38.614
Yeah.

38:38.616 --> 38:39.949
Yeah, I heard, Skip.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.418
Can we be even?

38:42.420 --> 38:43.686
Skip, just take it easy.

38:43.688 --> 38:46.055
Can we be even?
Just...

38:52.864 --> 38:55.765
Yeah, we're good.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.466
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.735
That's...

39:01.505 --> 39:03.406
Yeah, I got it. Thanks.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.007
That ain't right.
What's that?

39:05.009 --> 39:07.009
Canvass turned up
security camera footage

39:07.011 --> 39:09.178
clearly showing Green
and his crew

39:09.180 --> 39:12.014
smashing the plate glass,
then going in and coming out.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.749
The precinct had
the footage an hour later,

39:13.751 --> 39:15.051
and they sat on it.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.986
Now, given the vics
in this instance,

39:16.988 --> 39:18.781
I can understand
why they'd sit back.

39:18.805 --> 39:19.389
Danny.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.424
But we are supposed to
protect and serve everyone...

39:21.426 --> 39:23.259
Danny. Danny!
...no matter what.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.461
What?!

39:28.932 --> 39:31.200
♪

39:58.562 --> 40:00.796
Can't say I didn't
see this coming.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.565
Yeah.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.867
At least he died
doing what he loved.

40:05.769 --> 40:06.836
How's that?

40:06.838 --> 40:08.971
Taking out young black men.

40:10.340 --> 40:11.774
You know, he was a cop.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.175
He was?
He was.

40:14.878 --> 40:18.614
Retired from the 4-4, said
it was the job made him a bigot.

40:18.616 --> 40:19.849
He said that?

40:19.851 --> 40:20.950
That's what he said.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.551
You buy it?

40:22.553 --> 40:24.386
No, I don't buy it.

40:24.388 --> 40:25.888
What, then?

40:26.857 --> 40:30.025
He just wasn't the man
for the job.
