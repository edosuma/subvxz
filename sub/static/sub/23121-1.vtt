00:19.749 --> 00:22.652
Come on, slowpoke!

00:22.685 --> 00:25.356
-Is that all you've got?
-Hey, hey!

00:25.389 --> 00:27.590
-Come on.
-Hey!

00:28.859 --> 00:31.628
I told you,
you have to master one.

00:31.662 --> 00:36.867
Yeah, blame it
on the engine...

00:38.768 --> 00:40.403
Hey, wait up!

00:46.542 --> 00:49.479
Alright, alright, you win.

00:49.512 --> 00:52.315
I'm sorry. What? I didn't hear.

00:52.349 --> 00:55.186
I said, you win.

00:57.853 --> 01:01.624
-This is a bad idea.
-Yes, it is.

01:01.657 --> 01:04.962
No, really.
We've been gone too long.

01:04.995 --> 01:06.830
What are you worried about?

01:06.863 --> 01:09.366
Your sister isn't going to think
anything is going on.

01:09.399 --> 01:11.669
Look, this has been fun

01:11.702 --> 01:13.237
but this karma
is going to come back

01:13.270 --> 01:16.372
and bite us in the ass, man.

01:16.405 --> 01:20.478
Fine, we'll head back, but...

01:23.380 --> 01:24.581
One more time?

01:25.414 --> 01:27.651
And that's it.

01:27.684 --> 01:29.987
-Deal?
-Unbelievable.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.789
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:35.559 --> 01:37.628
Hey, Maggie, watch this! Yeah!

01:39.363 --> 01:42.967
Vince! Vince!

01:43.000 --> 01:44.702
Vince!

01:47.771 --> 01:49.307
Vince!

01:51.741 --> 01:54.478
-Vince!
-Help, Maggie, help!

01:54.511 --> 01:56.413
My God. What happened?

01:56.446 --> 01:57.447
-Maggie.
-You okay?

01:58.714 --> 02:01.818
Here, take my arm. Here.!

02:04.553 --> 02:06.923
Maggie?

02:08.991 --> 02:11.762
Maggie!

02:29.624 --> 02:33.691
TOXIC SHARK

02:35.282 --> 02:38.782
Subrip: Pix

03:31.475 --> 03:32.876
<i>Hola, mamacita.</i>

03:35.978 --> 03:37.747
And you thought
this was gonna be a bad idea.

03:37.781 --> 03:39.483
No, this is a bad idea.

03:39.515 --> 03:40.783
This place looks like
the first episode

03:40.817 --> 03:42.619
of one of those
horrible dating shows.

03:42.651 --> 03:44.520
Come on, man, you said
you wanted to do something

03:44.554 --> 03:45.889
to get your mind off your ex.

03:45.922 --> 03:47.791
Plus, none of us
ever liked her, anyway.

03:47.823 --> 03:50.393
-She was toxic.
-A singles' retreat though, man?

03:50.426 --> 03:53.030
I was thinking, like,
Vegas or Tijuana even.

03:53.062 --> 03:55.566
Vegas is where you met Eden,
stupid.

03:55.598 --> 03:57.567
No! No Vegas trip.

03:57.601 --> 03:59.803
This is Puerto Rico, baby!

03:59.835 --> 04:01.704
I can't believe
you're bitchin' about this.

04:01.738 --> 04:03.774
Do you know how long it took me
to save up for this trip?

04:03.806 --> 04:06.410
The phone company does not
give out Christmas bonuses.

04:06.442 --> 04:07.944
Really,
this coming from the guy

04:07.977 --> 04:09.879
who hasn't paid a phone bill in,
what, eight years?

04:09.912 --> 04:12.749
Well, you fix the lines,
you don't pay the fines.

04:12.782 --> 04:15.452
-I've never heard that before.
-What're you guys talking about?

04:15.484 --> 04:18.821
I mean, look at this place.
This place is beautiful!

04:18.853 --> 04:21.656
Yo, anyway, let's unload.
Yeah, I need to hit the gym.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.994
My pecs are feeling kinda soft
from the travel?

04:24.027 --> 04:25.696
There's no gym, dum-dum.

04:25.729 --> 04:27.631
The only thing soft
on this island is your brain.

04:27.664 --> 04:30.000
Wait, what? You said
this was a fitness retreat.

04:30.032 --> 04:32.835
It's a off-the-grid,
rugged, campsite thingy, man

04:32.869 --> 04:34.871
just like we did
when we were Boy Scouts

04:34.905 --> 04:39.743
but with girls,
snorkels and girls.

04:39.775 --> 04:41.677
How'd I get
talked into this again?

04:41.710 --> 04:46.417
Look, brah, girls and boats,
your two favorite things.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.852
And if you're lucky, you're
bound to go down on one of 'em.

04:48.885 --> 04:50.454
Yeah, bro!

04:54.825 --> 04:57.061
Whatever. Let's check in.
It's reality-show time.

04:58.628 --> 05:01.131
Hey, think of it this way?

05:01.164 --> 05:03.167
It's a way to get your mind off
of, what's her name?

05:03.200 --> 05:05.869
Eden. My ex-girlfriend's name
is Eden, Ryan.

05:05.902 --> 05:07.104
-Yeah.
-Good job.

05:11.607 --> 05:12.742
Hi there.

05:14.176 --> 05:15.746
Watch your step.

05:19.181 --> 05:21.884
This place is beautiful!

05:21.917 --> 05:23.987
-I like your shirt.
-Thanks. We sell them.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.889
-Did you get the catalog?
-Yeah.

05:25.922 --> 05:28.025
You know, the guys in here
just got lucky

05:28.058 --> 05:30.127
now that you girls arrived.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.862
Great line.

05:34.698 --> 05:36.532
Come on, Eden, he's charming.

05:36.566 --> 05:39.102
Yeah, yeah. Charming.

05:39.135 --> 05:41.104
Alright. You girls
are in the Gutanna group.

05:41.136 --> 05:43.105
Your cabin is just north
over the hill.

05:43.138 --> 05:45.809
Gutanna group? Do we get
color-coded buffs, too?

05:47.176 --> 05:49.078
Like, on "Survivor?" No?

05:49.112 --> 05:51.047
Am I the only one
that still watches that show?

05:51.080 --> 05:52.549
Yeah.

05:52.582 --> 05:54.017
You know, this place
is run by Reese.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.852
He's like a fitness superstar.

05:55.886 --> 05:58.087
Yeah, we read about that
on the website.

05:58.121 --> 05:59.256
When are we gonna eat?

05:59.289 --> 06:00.824
-I don't know.
-I'm hungry.

06:00.857 --> 06:03.126
But we got a chef
from New York.

06:03.159 --> 06:04.962
He's really good.

06:04.994 --> 06:06.662
-Here?
-Yeah, here.

06:06.696 --> 06:09.265
Just settle in, and in an hour
there's gonna be lunch.

06:09.299 --> 06:13.070
It's gonna be, like, fresh crab,
mango kale salad

06:13.102 --> 06:14.670
and something else.
I don't know.

06:14.703 --> 06:16.906
What else is on the menu?

06:16.939 --> 06:18.674
I think this might be
a good time to mention

06:18.708 --> 06:20.210
that I'm allergic to shellfish

06:20.242 --> 06:22.512
and pretty much anything else
from the sea.

06:22.546 --> 06:23.848
Perfect.

06:26.883 --> 06:28.652
Hey, you sure
I can't convince you

06:28.684 --> 06:29.952
to hang out
for a couple of days?

06:29.986 --> 06:31.622
Listen, you like golf, right?

06:31.655 --> 06:32.989
Puerto Rico's got
some of the most gorgeous

06:33.023 --> 06:34.525
golf courses in all the country.

06:34.558 --> 06:35.759
You know, another inspector
might think

06:35.792 --> 06:37.160
you were trying to bribe me,
Reese.

06:37.193 --> 06:38.962
That would mean
I have something to hide

06:38.994 --> 06:41.965
but I passed, right? I passed.
So what's the problem?

06:41.998 --> 06:44.268
The problem is the numerous
complaints by former guests

06:44.301 --> 06:46.003
reporting sudden illnesses
after staying at your...

06:46.035 --> 06:48.170
Come on, that's a bunch of BS.

06:48.203 --> 06:50.806
Listen, like I said, we offer
a highly intensive

06:50.840 --> 06:53.143
physical and spiritual package.

06:53.176 --> 06:55.779
Sometimes the body is
not used to a jolt like that.

06:55.811 --> 06:57.948
Listen, getting sick for
a few days is just part of it.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.582
-Whatever you say.
-They'll recover.

06:59.616 --> 07:01.685
Here. Take this.

07:04.253 --> 07:06.556
-What's this for?
-Water-testing kit.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.958
Better for you to be prepared
when you start hearing

07:07.991 --> 07:09.893
from the lawyers,
I'd test the seawater

07:09.926 --> 07:12.896
every morning if I was you,
before anyone goes swimming.

07:12.929 --> 07:14.198
Let's go.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.209
Have a nice trip.

07:37.087 --> 07:39.823
<i>-Reese, come in. You there?
-Yeah.</i>

07:39.855 --> 07:41.157
<i>You got the lunch figured out
for today?</i>

07:41.191 --> 07:42.359
No, Damiano and Gregory

07:42.391 --> 07:43.893
are supposed to be
working on that.

07:43.926 --> 07:46.095
<i>-If you say so.
-Okay.</i>

07:52.969 --> 07:55.372
Look at this, man. You see this?

07:55.405 --> 07:59.309
All my nets
are ripped to shreds.

07:59.342 --> 08:02.580
I'm just gonna try it
over there one more time.

08:05.047 --> 08:06.282
I don't get it.

08:06.316 --> 08:08.150
This is the third net
today already.

08:08.184 --> 08:10.287
-That's messed up.
-Yeah, this ocean stinks, man.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.323
I'm telling you, man, it's
the same thing all over again.

08:13.355 --> 08:15.725
And what's the smell?

08:15.758 --> 08:17.259
I mean, is it you, me?

08:17.292 --> 08:19.996
I can't even tell anymore
if it's a fish.

08:20.030 --> 08:21.999
-Geez.
-Well, it's not me.

08:22.032 --> 08:23.900
I mean, if you showered
more than once, maybe...

08:23.933 --> 08:25.202
Come on, Greg. Shut up.

08:25.234 --> 08:28.638
I used to be a chef in New York,
you know?

08:28.672 --> 08:31.273
This is useless, man. We're
not gonna catch anything here.

08:31.306 --> 08:33.342
I cook the fish,
I'm not supposed to be, like

08:33.376 --> 08:36.412
ass-deep in this ocean
tryin' to catch them.

08:36.446 --> 08:39.349
A week ago,
all this area was full of fish

08:39.381 --> 08:42.818
and right now, what,
they flew south or something?

08:42.851 --> 08:45.154
-I don't know.
-You know, it's just like...

08:45.187 --> 08:47.723
-What the hell?
-What?

08:47.757 --> 08:50.327
I stepped on a sea urchin
or something.

08:50.359 --> 08:53.162
I'm done with this.
You know what? I'm done!

08:53.196 --> 08:55.798
-What the hell, man? That's it!
-Dude, what are we cooking?

08:55.831 --> 08:57.667
You know what?
Make some tuna salad.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.671
I'm done. I'm not getting
paid enough for this crap.

09:00.704 --> 09:02.973
You know? That's it. I'm going.

09:03.005 --> 09:05.875
Come on, help me! Greg!

09:05.908 --> 09:07.878
Hey, come on! Help!
My eyes! It burns!

09:07.911 --> 09:09.747
Come on, help!

09:34.870 --> 09:36.472
Do your phones work?
I have no signal.

09:36.505 --> 09:38.274
It was working fine in San Juan.

09:38.307 --> 09:42.745
Well, we are on a small island
in the middle of nowhere.

09:42.778 --> 09:45.414
Bummer, you won't get
to read your nerd books

09:45.447 --> 09:48.317
on your Kindle app
while we're on vacation.

09:48.350 --> 09:50.486
I wouldn't mind being able
to post selfies, though.

09:50.519 --> 09:53.823
Books, I downloaded earlier.
You should try reading sometime.

09:53.856 --> 09:57.359
-Hey, city girls.
-You guys wanted to disconnect.

09:57.393 --> 09:59.495
We are disconnected.

09:59.528 --> 10:01.731
<i>I wanted you
to stop checking to see</i>

10:01.764 --> 10:04.266
if he texted every ten seconds.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.203
No, it's, it's,
it's over this time.

10:06.235 --> 10:09.038
-It's done. Over.
-It's fine.

10:09.071 --> 10:11.340
We were just making sure.

10:11.374 --> 10:13.777
Yeah, and anyway,
you're like a crazy nature girl.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.811
You should love this place.

10:15.845 --> 10:17.147
Take a hike in the rain forest

10:17.180 --> 10:19.416
get some samples
for your whatever.

10:19.449 --> 10:21.918
I study environmental science.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.920
-Exactly.
-God.

10:23.952 --> 10:28.191
This place is like
a tropical Tinder island.

10:29.492 --> 10:31.527
Yeah.

10:31.561 --> 10:34.030
Like the saying goes,
"The best way to get over a guy

10:34.062 --> 10:35.532
is to get under another one."

10:35.565 --> 10:37.467
Seriously? Who says that?

10:37.499 --> 10:39.402
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

10:39.435 --> 10:41.537
By the end of the week,
you'll have completely

10:41.571 --> 10:44.407
forgotten about that loser.
You didn't even like him anyway.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.910
Okay, well, you constantly
bringing him up

10:46.942 --> 10:50.279
isn't helping anything.

10:50.312 --> 10:53.984
So how about you, Audra? You
could use a little loosening up.

10:54.017 --> 10:56.820
I'm loose, so loose and...
I'm super-loose, guys...

10:56.853 --> 10:59.823
Okay, you should probably
stop saying that.

11:01.456 --> 11:05.195
-Those guys look so...
-Fab?

11:05.228 --> 11:08.799
-Fab and...
-Dumb.

11:08.831 --> 11:10.933
It's not like you have to start
a book club with them.

11:15.037 --> 11:17.807
Domino, Gregory.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.375
Domino, Gregory, come in.

11:24.314 --> 11:27.384
Hello, where are you?
Domino, Gregory!

11:30.119 --> 11:31.888
Have you seen Domino or Gregory?

11:31.921 --> 11:33.989
-Damiano?
-What'd I say?

11:34.023 --> 11:36.359
Yeah, Domino. Damiano, yeah.

11:36.392 --> 11:38.427
I saw them head out to the dock,
like, an hour ago.

11:38.460 --> 11:42.032
-What about you, Jesse?
-No. Why? What's up?

11:44.234 --> 11:45.969
Hey, you, look at me.
Look at me.

11:46.002 --> 11:48.572
What? What?
Go ahead, spit it out.

11:48.604 --> 11:51.340
Damiano hasn't been happy
in a while.

11:51.374 --> 11:54.277
Damiano's not happy.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.946
Well, those idiots better not
have walked off like Neil did.

11:56.979 --> 11:59.081
Unsafe conditions,
lousy accommodations.

11:59.114 --> 12:01.350
What do they think this is,
a luxury resort?

12:01.383 --> 12:02.952
I mean, whatever happened
to two-week notice?

12:02.985 --> 12:04.186
Those damn millennials.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.455
Pretty sure
Damiano is, like, 40.

12:05.488 --> 12:07.457
-Hey, you're not helping.
-Okay.

12:07.489 --> 12:11.327
Listen... we've got
that meet-and-greet coming up.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.362
We've got nothing to eat.
I got it.

12:13.396 --> 12:14.865
Why don't you two
jump back here

12:14.898 --> 12:16.132
open up the fridge
and see if you guys

12:16.165 --> 12:18.268
can throw something together,
okay?

12:18.301 --> 12:20.503
-Really?
-You got a problem with that?

12:20.536 --> 12:23.106
Where's your T-shirt? Where's
your Bodies By Reese T-shirt?

12:23.138 --> 12:24.240
It's in my locker. I'll grab it.

12:24.273 --> 12:25.542
Yeah, I want you to wear that.

12:25.575 --> 12:26.575
You know what?
Actually, scratch that.

12:26.609 --> 12:28.277
Why don't you go fix my boat?

12:28.311 --> 12:29.879
I was trying to start it
this morning, wasn't working.

12:29.912 --> 12:31.013
I know nothing about boats...

12:31.047 --> 12:32.114
But you're a medic, right?

12:32.148 --> 12:33.416
-Yeah.
-Medics fix things.

12:33.449 --> 12:35.151
-Exactly. People.
-And you're a lifeguard.

12:35.183 --> 12:36.452
Which means you deal with things
in the water.

12:36.485 --> 12:37.653
-Right?
-What are you getting at?

12:37.686 --> 12:41.157
Broken boat
in the water. Go fix it.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.292
Please.

12:43.325 --> 12:46.162
-Just go fix the boat.
-Right on it, Reese.

12:46.195 --> 12:48.665
Listen, Erin, I was gonna do
the "Puerto Rico!"

12:48.697 --> 12:51.167
or do you think I should do
"Reese! Reese! Reese"?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.203
-Why...
-You know what?

12:53.235 --> 12:54.670
Don't worry about it.
I'll decide and...

12:54.704 --> 12:56.373
-What's the name of this island?
-Culebrita Island.

12:56.406 --> 12:58.642
-Curberi, Curbi...
-Culebrita.

12:58.675 --> 13:00.243
-You say it.
-Right. Okay.

13:00.276 --> 13:02.378
Okay. It's the one
on the north shore.

13:02.412 --> 13:05.215
-Gotta learn some Spanish, man.
-Positive attitude, guys.

13:05.248 --> 13:08.652
-Positive attitude.
-I hate you.

13:08.685 --> 13:10.520
The guy wearing a scarf
in 90-degree weather

13:10.552 --> 13:12.655
is telling the medic
to go fix the boat.

13:12.689 --> 13:14.291
-Makes a lot of sense.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:14.324 --> 13:16.293
Welcome to Bodies by that guy.

13:16.325 --> 13:18.427
Right now he's got the cook out
looking for stuff to cook.

13:18.460 --> 13:21.330
-Do you see how this works?
-Sadly, I do.

13:21.364 --> 13:22.999
-I'm not doing it.
-I'll be back.

13:23.032 --> 13:24.401
Yup, you do that.

13:24.433 --> 13:28.370
You've got a workout at 3:30.

13:28.403 --> 13:29.672
Safety check.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.075
Fun stuff.

13:54.998 --> 13:57.167
<i>Hey, mami.</i>

13:57.200 --> 13:59.703
-Yeah.
-Hey.

13:59.735 --> 14:01.604
Think this shirt's too tight?

14:01.637 --> 14:04.975
Is that a shirt
or a sausage casing?

14:05.008 --> 14:07.444
Okay, good.
Hey, what do you think?

14:07.476 --> 14:09.378
It looks great, Ryan, yeah.

14:09.412 --> 14:12.415
You know, just don't, like,
flex or bend over

14:12.447 --> 14:14.216
or probably breathe.

14:14.249 --> 14:17.486
Alright.
Hey, bogies coming in.

14:17.519 --> 14:19.555
Hottie at three.

14:19.589 --> 14:21.624
Maverick is engaging.

14:23.026 --> 14:25.362
I'm pretty sure that's 6 p.m.

14:25.394 --> 14:28.030
Yeah, he can't tell time.

14:28.064 --> 14:29.366
Wait, where'd you get
that drink from?

14:29.398 --> 14:31.000
Cabana out front, man. Grab one.

14:31.033 --> 14:34.269
I'll see you at the beach.

14:44.147 --> 14:45.448
My God.
I'm so sorry.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.350
I know, it's totally okay.
I'm so sorry.

14:47.383 --> 14:49.018
And it's totally my fault.

14:49.051 --> 14:51.021
-My...
-God.

14:51.053 --> 14:53.023
-Seriously?
-You've gotta be kidding me.

14:53.056 --> 14:54.490
Did you follow me here?

14:54.523 --> 14:56.158
Why the hell
would I follow you here?

14:56.191 --> 14:57.626
I came here
to get away from you.

14:57.659 --> 14:59.194
I can't even believe this.

14:59.228 --> 15:00.662
I mean, what-what are you
doing here?

15:00.696 --> 15:02.565
-Did somebody set this up?
-Who would set this up?

15:02.598 --> 15:04.601
I don't know, maybe
one of your dumb-ass friends.

15:04.633 --> 15:05.734
Okay, Calm down.

15:05.768 --> 15:08.171
They are not...

15:09.705 --> 15:11.807
Yeah, okay,
you got a small point there.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.542
Yeah, but I don't think
they would do this.

15:13.575 --> 15:16.311
I mean, you are literally
the last person on Earth

15:16.345 --> 15:17.513
that I wanna see right now.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.048
Yeah? Yeah.

15:19.081 --> 15:20.450
'Cause I was really hoping
I'd bump into

15:20.483 --> 15:23.453
my crazy ex-girlfriend
on a deserted island.

15:23.485 --> 15:25.654
-I mean, this is just crazy.
-I'm crazy? Are you kidding?

15:25.687 --> 15:27.723
I'm sorry, Sam,
that I have emotions

15:27.757 --> 15:29.792
something that you don't know
anything about!

15:29.825 --> 15:33.229
Yeah, right. Emotional, crazy.
Tomato, tomahto.

15:33.262 --> 15:34.696
-Right, Eden?
-Okay.

15:34.729 --> 15:36.166
We're leaving, we're leaving.

15:36.199 --> 15:37.434
-Good.
-We have to go. We have to go.

15:37.466 --> 15:38.801
-We have to go.
-Did you forget?

15:38.835 --> 15:40.235
We're stuck here for a week.

15:40.268 --> 15:42.272
We have to kayak back alone.

15:42.305 --> 15:44.074
We can't just go, Eden.

15:44.106 --> 15:46.508
Plus, there's this guy, Mark.
He's really cute.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.644
And we spent so much money
to be here.

15:48.677 --> 15:49.745
Gross, right?

15:52.481 --> 15:54.750
Well, I'm not leaving.

15:54.783 --> 15:56.418
Well, then I'm not leaving.
Okay?

15:56.451 --> 15:58.687
I'm not gonna let you ruin
another vacation

15:58.720 --> 16:00.222
like you ruined Cancun.

16:00.255 --> 16:02.658
Cancun? And there it is.

16:02.691 --> 16:04.827
I got food poisoning,
you psycho.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.128
How is that my fault?

16:06.162 --> 16:07.564
-I'm a psycho?
-Yes.

16:07.596 --> 16:09.331
Are you kidding? I'm the psycho?

16:09.364 --> 16:11.301
I told you not to eat
that octopus, but you had

16:11.334 --> 16:13.436
to get that stupid picture
with the tentacles...

16:13.469 --> 16:15.171
Yeah, and you said you loved
that picture...

16:15.204 --> 16:17.474
Alright, alright. Just everyone
just calm down, please.

16:17.507 --> 16:19.209
Just calm down.

16:19.242 --> 16:21.176
Listen, if we all just realize
the basic fundamentals

16:21.210 --> 16:22.778
of guys and girls,
we'll all be okay.

16:22.811 --> 16:25.514
What are the basic fundamentals
of guys and girls?

16:25.547 --> 16:27.383
This should be enlightening.

16:27.416 --> 16:31.588
Well, that's easy. Guys are dumb
and girls are crazy.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.422
And if you guys would figure
that out when you were dating...

16:33.455 --> 16:35.124
You guys are all idiots.

16:35.157 --> 16:36.825
Yes, girl, that's exactly
what I'm sayin'.

16:36.859 --> 16:39.128
Okay. How 'bout this?

16:39.162 --> 16:41.131
Why don't we just stay

16:41.163 --> 16:43.665
and you guys
just keep your distance?

16:43.699 --> 16:45.734
-Cool?
-And that's crazy.

16:45.768 --> 16:48.504
-See? You're gettin' it.
-This is not gonna work.

16:48.537 --> 16:51.240
-Surprise, surprise.
-What is that supposed to mean?

16:51.273 --> 16:52.908
You know what it means,
Eden. Shut up.

16:52.941 --> 16:56.412
Don't tell me to shut up, okay?
. Du.

16:56.445 --> 16:58.648
Yeah. Yeah, easy. Bye.

17:00.816 --> 17:02.218
Are you kiddin' me, man?

17:02.250 --> 17:05.186
-Dude, what...
-How?

17:05.220 --> 17:09.758
Reese, Reese, Reese!
Reese, Reese, Reese!

17:15.430 --> 17:16.565
Thank you!

17:18.733 --> 17:21.570
Let me hear you say,
"I'm single!"

17:21.603 --> 17:22.905
I'm single!

17:22.938 --> 17:25.541
Let me hear you say, "I'm sexy."

17:25.574 --> 17:26.842
I'm sexy!

17:26.876 --> 17:29.878
Yes, you are!

17:29.911 --> 17:33.482
Did you know, when a man
and woman sweat together

17:33.515 --> 17:35.752
it opens up their minds?

17:35.784 --> 17:38.921
When a man and woman
exert together

17:38.955 --> 17:42.759
it increases their sexuality

17:42.792 --> 17:45.695
their libido Latino.

17:48.965 --> 17:50.800
You swear you had nothing
to do with that?

17:50.832 --> 17:53.636
-Dude, seriously?
-I had to ask, man, just...

17:53.668 --> 17:56.805
Dude, I think Eden's here.

17:56.839 --> 17:59.242
-Yep.
-You can't get that at a bar.

17:59.274 --> 18:01.744
-You can't get that...
-Yeah, don't point, Ryan.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.313
Right here.

18:04.347 --> 18:07.417
Open up your mind
to the positive possibilities

18:07.449 --> 18:10.385
and let's shift out
the negative ones.

18:10.418 --> 18:14.290
You right there
in the girl's shirt.

18:14.322 --> 18:16.792
Shift it out.

18:16.826 --> 18:18.761
-Who is that guy?
-Shift it out.

18:18.793 --> 18:22.297
I've modeled with models
from all over the world

18:22.330 --> 18:24.266
and I've competed
with the greatest athletes

18:24.300 --> 18:25.768
of all time.

18:25.801 --> 18:27.704
And I've taken that information

18:27.736 --> 18:30.606
and mixed it up
with social media, spirituality

18:30.639 --> 18:34.310
physical therapy,
and I created this place.

18:34.342 --> 18:36.345
-Bodies By Reese.
-Can I get a sip of that?

18:36.378 --> 18:37.781
-A singles' retreat.
-No.

18:38.813 --> 18:39.949
For you.

18:41.550 --> 18:44.854
You, you, you,
you, you and you.

18:44.887 --> 18:47.991
-Stop looking over there.
-What? I don't know, man.

18:50.693 --> 18:53.463
I, I just had a premonition.

18:53.495 --> 18:54.930
I mean, I'm always right, right?

18:54.964 --> 18:56.299
Reese, Reese...

18:56.331 --> 18:58.501
Someone here...

18:58.533 --> 19:01.737
is gonna find
that special someone...

19:01.771 --> 19:04.374
that they're gonna spend
the rest of their lives with.

19:04.407 --> 19:06.475
-Let's get some. Yeah!
-Yeah!

19:09.477 --> 19:10.712
My name's Reese.

19:10.745 --> 19:13.282
If you need anything,
anything at all

19:13.315 --> 19:15.450
you come to me... through there.

19:15.484 --> 19:19.355
<i>Mi casa su casa. Goodbye.</i>

19:19.388 --> 19:21.823
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Reese.

19:21.857 --> 19:26.462
Everybody,
welcome to Bodies By Reese...

19:26.494 --> 19:28.630
where we will turn you
into a piece

19:28.664 --> 19:30.300
in Culebrita, Puerto Rico!

19:30.332 --> 19:31.633
Yeah.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.602
Thank you!

19:33.636 --> 19:34.971
My name is Erin.

19:58.461 --> 20:01.064
Geez, is every boat
on this island broken?

20:16.911 --> 20:18.547
"My boat won't work."

20:44.439 --> 20:45.975
What the...

20:50.879 --> 20:52.681
Okay.

20:59.722 --> 21:01.657
What the hell was that?

21:16.705 --> 21:18.742
Yeah, you know what? No.

21:38.694 --> 21:39.928
Yeah, man. That's what
it's all about, you know?

21:44.500 --> 21:46.102
Wait a...

21:46.135 --> 21:47.603
Wait.

21:47.636 --> 21:49.205
Yo, I think that was Eden, bro.

21:49.237 --> 21:52.073
It's kind of funny, man.

21:52.107 --> 21:54.976
You okay? Because you seem not.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.513
-No, I'm fine.
-Okay.

21:57.545 --> 21:59.047
Because if you're upset,
you should talk about it.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.551
-I know you shut down...
-No, I said I'm okay.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.485
Can we please stop talking
about this?

22:03.519 --> 22:04.787
I'm just sayin'.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.657
It's uncomfortable.

22:07.689 --> 22:09.424
Yeah, I don't think
I can get this off.

22:13.495 --> 22:15.163
What's that?

22:15.196 --> 22:18.600
It's a shark band.
I'm terrified of sharks.

22:18.634 --> 22:20.570
Let me ask you a question, Zane.

22:20.602 --> 22:21.903
How'd you find out
about this place?

22:21.936 --> 22:23.840
I read it in a magazine
on your toilet tank.

22:23.872 --> 22:25.507
Yeah, you did? Yeah?

22:25.541 --> 22:28.109
Those are Eden's women's
health magazines, you idiot.

22:28.142 --> 22:31.880
Dude. No wonder she's here.

22:31.914 --> 22:35.484
A shark band, like, one of those
British spy things

22:35.517 --> 22:38.119
that tells time and sprays
poison out of the base of it?

22:38.153 --> 22:39.922
No, no,
it just has magnets in it.

22:39.955 --> 22:41.791
When magnets
mix with the saltwater

22:41.823 --> 22:44.726
it creates
this electromagnetic pulse.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.530
The sharks hate it
and they swim away from it.

22:47.562 --> 22:49.965
You think it'll work
on ex-boyfriends?

22:49.998 --> 22:51.566
You guys are not gonna
let this go, are you?

22:51.600 --> 22:53.269
I'm not, but...

22:53.301 --> 22:54.837
Yes, I am because...

22:54.869 --> 22:56.037
This is all your fault.

22:56.071 --> 22:59.108
Thank you. Seriously, thank you.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.810
Dude, let me...
Give me, give me.

23:01.976 --> 23:03.513
Just keep it on.

23:09.551 --> 23:12.588
My God, look at her,
pretending to be injured

23:12.620 --> 23:15.257
so that two guys
will carry her in.

23:15.291 --> 23:16.960
It's not the worst plan.

23:19.594 --> 23:22.964
I don't, I don't think
she's pretending.

23:22.997 --> 23:25.066
What's wrong? God.
Gabriella, what's happening?

23:25.100 --> 23:26.968
I don't know.
Something grazed up against me.

23:27.002 --> 23:28.704
-What's going on?
-Something in the water.

23:28.736 --> 23:30.872
I don't know, it was just
so near. I looked at it.

23:30.906 --> 23:32.707
I thought it was the guys
just messing around.

23:32.741 --> 23:34.744
Well, this looks really bad.
We have to get her to a medic.

23:34.776 --> 23:36.845
-What could have done that?
-Maybe some big jellyfish.

23:36.878 --> 23:39.916
Like one of those, those,
carton things, you know?

23:39.948 --> 23:41.616
Carton things?
You mean, box jellyfish?

23:41.649 --> 23:43.051
Yeah, whatever.
I'm not a zoologist.

23:43.084 --> 23:44.953
-Neither am I.
-Okay, I don't care what it is.

23:44.986 --> 23:46.254
-But it really hurts. Let's go.
-Alright, alright.

23:46.288 --> 23:47.790
-Let's go.
-Let's get her a medic, come on.

24:08.744 --> 24:11.580
Easy, girl.

24:18.087 --> 24:20.723
It's okay, girl.
You'll love the water.

24:22.291 --> 24:24.193
What's with you today?

24:26.895 --> 24:29.032
It's okay, girl.

24:32.368 --> 24:35.370
What's going on? What's wrong?

24:35.404 --> 24:36.739
It's okay.

24:39.742 --> 24:42.177
What's happening?

25:01.429 --> 25:03.799
Careful. Are, are you okay?

25:04.933 --> 25:07.269
-I'm fine. It's fine.
-Okay.

25:07.301 --> 25:09.905
I mean, what do you think
has caused that?

25:09.937 --> 25:13.208
You said you brushed up
against something?

25:13.242 --> 25:16.177
It could be a reef burn, we have
a bunch of fire coral out there.

25:16.211 --> 25:17.913
She said it could be
a jellyfish.

25:17.946 --> 25:19.982
No, it's definitely
not a jelly sting.

25:20.014 --> 25:22.083
Okay, well, do you think
that she's gonna be okay?

25:22.117 --> 25:24.387
I mean, I mean, maybe we should
think about canceling the trip.

25:24.419 --> 25:26.221
Going back you can go
to a real hospital...

25:26.254 --> 25:28.757
Eden, I know what you're doing.
We're not leaving.

25:28.791 --> 25:30.725
Well, what if it gets infected?

25:30.759 --> 25:31.961
I mean, I'm online all the time.

25:31.994 --> 25:33.329
One minute, you have a scratch

25:33.361 --> 25:36.165
the next you're down four limbs
and a spleen.

25:36.197 --> 25:37.899
Gee, thanks, Audra.

25:37.933 --> 25:40.036
I've seen crazier things happen.

25:40.069 --> 25:41.803
Maybe if you spend less time
on the Internet.

25:41.837 --> 25:44.974
Yeah, you're not really helping
the situation here.

25:45.006 --> 25:47.943
Relax, ladies.
Just a minor burn.

25:50.713 --> 25:52.447
See?

25:52.481 --> 25:55.117
So when can I get outta here?

25:55.149 --> 25:57.786
I'd like to thank the guys
that saved me.

25:57.820 --> 26:01.456
Well, I just need to wrap it up.
It's still an open wound.

26:01.490 --> 26:04.260
Maybe some antibiotics.
And stay out of the water.

26:04.292 --> 26:07.362
-Okay. I'll stay here with you.
-No.

26:07.396 --> 26:10.331
-You go, have fun.
-I'm not having fun anyway.

26:10.365 --> 26:13.301
Audra, can you go
take her somewhere?

26:13.334 --> 26:16.037
I thought I came here
with my friends, not my mother.

26:16.071 --> 26:18.073
I think there's a yoga class
going on.

26:18.107 --> 26:20.309
Okay, I will go do yoga.

26:21.342 --> 26:23.045
Good. See you, guys.

26:33.054 --> 26:35.123
Hey, do you know
where the yoga is happening?

26:35.157 --> 26:37.426
You missed it.
They just left.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.427
But I have a high-intensity
workout starting soon.

26:39.461 --> 26:40.930
Okay.

26:40.963 --> 26:43.132
-How's your friend doing?
-She's fine.

26:43.165 --> 26:45.134
The medic said it was
a abrasion wound or something?

26:45.167 --> 26:47.136
-Reef burn.
-Okay.

26:47.168 --> 26:50.906
She's gonna be just fine.
You got a second?

26:50.938 --> 26:52.173
Why don't you guys go down
to the beach

26:52.206 --> 26:53.341
and I'll meet you there
in a second?

26:53.375 --> 26:55.478
Okay.

26:55.511 --> 26:58.214
-What's up?
-Walk with me.

26:58.246 --> 27:00.282
Did you see Gwen anywhere?

27:00.314 --> 27:02.217
She never came back from
her horse ride for her meds

27:02.251 --> 27:03.418
and she's like
Johnny-on-the-spot

27:03.452 --> 27:04.453
with those things.

27:04.485 --> 27:05.487
We're on an island.

27:05.521 --> 27:06.522
I'm sure she'll pop up.

27:06.554 --> 27:09.190
Or she walked?

27:09.224 --> 27:11.761
-Stop it, come on.
-Seriously.

27:13.262 --> 27:15.798
So what? What are you thinking?

27:15.830 --> 27:17.433
Maybe I'm just being paranoid

27:17.465 --> 27:20.503
but when Reese the genius
sent me to fix his boat

27:20.535 --> 27:24.005
there was something in the water
and it almost tipped me over.

27:25.974 --> 27:27.943
Don't be stupid. You...

27:27.975 --> 27:29.277
We both know
that Reese hasn't been

27:29.311 --> 27:32.114
making a lot of friends
on the staff lately.

27:32.147 --> 27:33.849
Maybe they've been planning
a walkout.

27:33.881 --> 27:35.450
A walkout? Really, though?

27:35.484 --> 27:37.186
There's only a few boats
on the island

27:37.218 --> 27:39.988
one of 'em's broken.
Where's everybody walking to?

27:41.557 --> 27:42.892
I don't know.

27:45.927 --> 27:47.196
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

27:47.228 --> 27:48.797
I don't know either.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.331
But I do know if they were
planning a walkout

27:50.365 --> 27:51.967
I'm a little bummed
they didn't tell us about it

27:52.000 --> 27:53.234
'cause now we're stuck here
with Reese...

27:53.267 --> 27:55.036
Alright, alright.
Let's not panic.

27:55.070 --> 27:57.106
-I'm panicking.
-And let's not tell Reese yet.

27:57.138 --> 27:59.542
Until we have a better idea
of what's happening here.

28:01.176 --> 28:05.114
It needs to be business
as usual for now.

28:05.147 --> 28:07.448
Why don't you go out and see
if you can track them down?

28:07.482 --> 28:10.186
Maybe they went out
for a nature walk or something.

28:12.553 --> 28:13.955
Hippies.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.994
And exhale.

28:19.494 --> 28:21.964
Hands to the sky.

28:23.465 --> 28:25.368
Good.

28:31.138 --> 28:32.542
Hold.

28:34.176 --> 28:36.512
Let the oxygen cleanse you.

28:46.588 --> 28:48.925
Namaste. Nice workout, everyone.

28:49.657 --> 28:51.292
Come, follow me.

28:51.326 --> 28:53.529
-Alright.
-Let's cool down.

28:53.561 --> 28:55.531
Come on.

28:55.563 --> 29:00.069
This water's great.
Nothing better than this water.

29:00.101 --> 29:03.071
Alright, guys!
Let's get started!

29:03.105 --> 29:05.374
We're gonna work up some sweat
and those endorphins

29:05.407 --> 29:07.609
by doing
a high-intensity workout

29:07.642 --> 29:11.045
with partners. Alright,
so this is a pair exercise.

29:11.079 --> 29:13.916
So, everybody,
reach in and grab a partner.

29:13.948 --> 29:16.051
Alright. Come on.

29:23.926 --> 29:25.261
-I got...
-Everyone.

29:25.293 --> 29:27.463
Find your collar match.

29:27.495 --> 29:30.299
Come on, pair up. Come on, guys.

29:30.331 --> 29:31.934
Hurry up. Come on. Pair up.

29:34.969 --> 29:37.005
Of course.

29:37.039 --> 29:38.907
Does anyone wanna
switch partners?

29:38.940 --> 29:41.476
No trades. That defeats
the point of this exercise.

29:41.510 --> 29:43.479
What is the point
of this exercise?

29:43.512 --> 29:47.081
Okay, so we're gonna start
with some ball squats.

29:47.115 --> 29:50.586
Everyone, grab their partner,
place the ball on your back...

29:50.619 --> 29:52.120
-Sorry.
-No chatter.

29:52.154 --> 29:55.190
Social hour is in half an hour.
Come on.

29:55.223 --> 29:56.926
-I'm not causing a scene.
-Yes, you are causing a scene.

29:56.958 --> 29:58.426
-No one is freaking out.
-Just do it.

29:58.459 --> 30:02.463
Right, so keep a straight back
and do some squats.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.332
Would you go down
at the same time?

30:04.366 --> 30:07.603
Can you hold on for two seconds?
Give me...

30:07.636 --> 30:09.672
You know, when you're ready.
I don't wanna rush you, Eden.

30:09.705 --> 30:11.139
We need to get on the same page.

30:11.173 --> 30:12.308
This is just like
the time we tried

30:12.340 --> 30:14.310
to do that workout you did.

30:14.342 --> 30:16.144
"Can you please
just slow down?"

30:16.177 --> 30:17.513
-Okay, first off, that's...
-"You're going so fast."

30:17.545 --> 30:19.080
That's not how I sound.

30:19.113 --> 30:20.481
I'm sorry, that's just
not how I sound.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.951
That's exactly how you sound.

30:22.984 --> 30:24.386
No, that's pretty accurate.

30:24.418 --> 30:25.586
-Okay? You ready?
-You're so sweet. Thank you.

30:25.619 --> 30:26.621
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

30:26.655 --> 30:29.692
Okay, let's go. One, two, three.

30:29.725 --> 30:31.592
-You didn't even go.
-I... No, I did, too. I went.

30:31.626 --> 30:33.195
-I totally went.
-I'm not gonna if you don't go.

30:33.227 --> 30:37.198
-Well, okay.
-One, two, go.

30:37.232 --> 30:39.568
-Come on, guys.
-Okay, see, look. This is easy.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.570
Could you please stop
being a jerk for two seconds?

30:41.602 --> 30:42.670
-Fine.
-Okay.

30:42.704 --> 30:43.973
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

30:44.005 --> 30:45.040
You didn't even ask about

30:45.072 --> 30:46.074
Gabriella, by the way.

30:46.108 --> 30:47.443
Why would I ask about Gabriella?

30:47.475 --> 30:49.344
Because she got really hurt
in the water.

30:49.378 --> 30:51.112
I wasn't in the water.
Why would I know that?

30:51.146 --> 30:52.580
Exactly, you were
too busy flirting

30:52.613 --> 30:54.983
with all the girls on the island
to notice anything else.

30:55.016 --> 30:57.485
Yeah, I was, actually,
'cause I'm a single guy.

30:57.519 --> 31:00.489
My God.
And I'm on a singles' retreat!

31:00.522 --> 31:02.624
-It's kind of the point, Eden.
-You're such a jerk.

31:02.657 --> 31:05.194
-Have fun being single.
-Come on, guys. Hey, hey, hey.

31:05.226 --> 31:07.262
Come on, guys.

31:07.294 --> 31:09.263
No. This is done.
I'm not doing this.

31:09.296 --> 31:11.533
Hey, bye, thank you.
This is stupid.

31:15.469 --> 31:18.206
Once again.
Keep your head in the game.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.142
Come on, guys. Good job.

31:20.175 --> 31:22.176
Gwen and Damiano
just straight up disappeared.

31:22.209 --> 31:23.578
Where could they
have possibly gone?

31:23.611 --> 31:25.480
-And Gregory.
-They couldn't have gone far.

31:25.513 --> 31:27.382
Reese's boat is right there.

31:27.416 --> 31:30.119
-Just try her on the walkie.
-She doesn't have one.

31:31.153 --> 31:32.288
What is this?

31:33.754 --> 31:35.157
I don't know.

31:36.824 --> 31:39.327
-What is this doing here?
-Don't ask me.

31:41.062 --> 31:43.765
-What is that thing?
-I don't know.

31:43.799 --> 31:46.002
I have no idea.
Let's get outta here.

31:52.506 --> 31:53.508
Yeah.

31:56.244 --> 31:57.780
Beautiful.

32:11.092 --> 32:12.561
Help!

32:36.251 --> 32:40.089
-What is that?
-That's a relay buoy.

32:40.121 --> 32:42.190
That's a ways away from
where it's supposed to be.

32:49.231 --> 32:51.433
Can I get some help?

32:51.465 --> 32:52.533
This is the main phone cable

32:52.567 --> 32:54.303
that connects us
to the mainland.

32:54.336 --> 32:56.138
Geez, Liam!

32:56.170 --> 32:57.806
I hate seaweed. Okay?

32:59.174 --> 33:00.743
Damn, that looks heavy.

33:03.410 --> 33:05.147
Well, this isn't good.

33:05.179 --> 33:06.782
No wonder we've been getting
shoddy phone service.

33:06.814 --> 33:08.382
No kidding. Now we have none.

33:08.416 --> 33:10.785
That's great.
How does that happen?

33:10.819 --> 33:12.354
Aren't they supposed to be
underwater?

33:12.387 --> 33:14.123
Apparently not.

33:14.156 --> 33:15.491
Let's just go
look for the others.

33:15.523 --> 33:18.260
We'll come back and deal
with this crap later.

33:24.465 --> 33:25.868
You gotta just, like,
forget about it.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.268
Pretend he's not here, you know?

33:27.301 --> 33:29.170
Yeah, easier said than done.

33:29.204 --> 33:30.705
-Hey. Let me see it.
-Hey.

33:30.738 --> 33:32.874
God, don't be gross. Audra.

33:32.907 --> 33:34.842
That looks awful.

33:34.876 --> 33:37.879
Good luck getting any actual pus
coming down your leg.

33:37.913 --> 33:40.883
You're even more disgusting
than she is.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.484
Do you want a drink
or something?

33:42.516 --> 33:44.485
You know what,
I think I'm just gonna

33:44.519 --> 33:46.755
chill for a little bit.

33:46.788 --> 33:49.291
-Okay.
-I'll meet you fools later.

33:49.323 --> 33:50.792
Do you want me
to walk back with you?

33:50.824 --> 33:53.794
No, it's okay. I'll be fine.

33:53.828 --> 33:56.165
-Well, get some rest.
-Yeah, feel better.

33:59.533 --> 34:03.571
Gabriella leaving the bar?
Not good.

34:03.605 --> 34:05.507
-I feel bad.
-Me, too.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.276
I can't believe
we can't find anyone.

34:07.309 --> 34:09.677
This is literally insane.
I've no idea where else to look.

34:09.710 --> 34:12.848
I wonder how many others
are missing. What's that?

34:16.250 --> 34:18.152
That's one of our shirts.

34:19.654 --> 34:20.822
Geez!

34:20.855 --> 34:22.224
What the hell, man?

34:22.257 --> 34:23.391
That's Damiano's arm.

34:23.424 --> 34:25.159
Let's go back, guys.

34:42.743 --> 34:44.512
My God! Are you okay?

34:44.545 --> 34:46.714
-Hey.
-I don't feel so good.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.719
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

34:51.752 --> 34:54.722
God. Okay, that's it.
We need some real help here.

34:56.523 --> 34:57.926
Hey, Reese! Reese!

34:59.527 --> 35:00.963
Hey, excuse me.
Everything'll be alright.

35:00.996 --> 35:02.364
You guys go have a good time,
please.

35:02.397 --> 35:04.232
Hey, we need to take her
to medical.

35:04.266 --> 35:06.768
Hey, hey. Are you alright?

35:06.801 --> 35:08.703
-Reese!
-Come on, get up.

35:08.737 --> 35:10.372
-Yeah.
-Reese!

35:10.404 --> 35:12.006
-Take it easy, take it easy.
-What?

35:12.040 --> 35:13.842
Walk her in, walk her inside.
Hey, look at me.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.911
Look at me. Take it easy. What?

35:19.014 --> 35:20.716
We have a serious problem.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.536
Alright! Waves!

35:43.571 --> 35:45.674
Come on, let's go catch a wave!

35:45.706 --> 35:47.576
Do it, do it, do it!

35:47.609 --> 35:50.679
-Come on.
-Yeah. Lookie.

35:50.712 --> 35:54.483
Yeah, man.

35:56.051 --> 35:59.654
-Come on, matey.
-Let's go, go, go.

36:05.793 --> 36:07.795
Come on, dude!

36:09.797 --> 36:12.600
-Get up, get up, get up, get up.
-Get out there, dude.

36:12.634 --> 36:15.036
Yeah. Get, get this one.

36:17.572 --> 36:20.509
-Come on the board!
-Get on the board. Go, go, go.

36:25.647 --> 36:29.851
-Come down.
-Something's got my leg!

36:32.987 --> 36:36.023
Hey, dudes, dudes!

36:51.505 --> 36:53.542
It was Damiano's.
I swear it was him.

36:53.574 --> 36:55.042
I saw the tattoo on his hand.

36:55.076 --> 36:57.411
And I also found this
marine test kit on the dock.

36:57.444 --> 36:58.680
You ever seen it before?

37:00.915 --> 37:02.516
No.

37:02.549 --> 37:04.919
-I'll look into it. Thanks.
-God, Damiano.

37:04.953 --> 37:06.355
I'm telling you, guys,
there's something

37:06.388 --> 37:07.889
not quite right
going on out there.

37:07.922 --> 37:09.590
So what are you saying?
It's a shark?

37:09.623 --> 37:11.560
-Well, I don't know.
-We need to evacuate everyone.

37:11.592 --> 37:12.893
-Over a shark?
-Yes.

37:12.927 --> 37:14.096
Come on,
sharks live in the ocean

37:14.128 --> 37:15.697
they have rights, too, besides

37:15.730 --> 37:17.065
I can't afford
that bad publicity right now.

37:17.098 --> 37:18.699
-Look at her, Reese!
-She looks fine to me.

37:18.732 --> 37:20.401
-She's sleeping like a baby.
-What? My God.

37:20.435 --> 37:21.902
She needs to be airlifted
out of here ASAP.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.571
Airlifted?
Who could afford that?

37:23.605 --> 37:25.005
There must be
some poison component

37:25.038 --> 37:26.507
in whatever scraped her,
because she's having

37:26.540 --> 37:28.008
a really bad reaction to it.

37:28.042 --> 37:29.511
And I don't have the resources

37:29.543 --> 37:31.078
to diagnose
or deal with it here.

37:31.112 --> 37:32.981
Yeah, and I can't make
any calls. My phone won't work.

37:33.014 --> 37:34.549
Look, that's just
a temporary outage.

37:34.581 --> 37:35.884
It happens all the time
here on the island.

37:35.917 --> 37:37.552
It's not temporary, Reese.

37:37.585 --> 37:39.721
I saw the relay buoy
washed ashore.

37:39.753 --> 37:42.590
The entire main line
was corroded.

37:42.623 --> 37:44.558
-Are you joking?
-This not a joke!

37:44.592 --> 37:46.695
We have a dead employee,
others are missing

37:46.728 --> 37:48.764
and we have a girl
with some inexplicable injury

37:48.797 --> 37:49.965
caused by something
in the water.

37:49.998 --> 37:51.133
We need to get her
to a hospital.

37:51.165 --> 37:52.167
Will you settle down?

37:52.199 --> 37:53.634
Just settle down.

37:53.668 --> 37:55.103
Can you start thinking
of the positive

37:55.136 --> 37:56.938
possibilities that shift
all the negative ones...

37:56.971 --> 37:58.840
-Okay, okay, so what's next?
-You breathe, breathe.

37:58.873 --> 38:00.743
I want you to breathe.
Breathe. You ready?

38:05.145 --> 38:07.715
Okay.

38:07.748 --> 38:09.583
I got it, we'll remove everyone
from the ocean

38:09.616 --> 38:12.153
and we'll get everyone started
on land activities, okay?

38:12.186 --> 38:15.056
Okay, that's genius, but we're
on a beach retreat, Reese.

38:15.089 --> 38:17.058
So how are we gonna
get everybody out of the water

38:17.090 --> 38:19.560
without telling them
what's going on?

38:19.594 --> 38:23.432
Tell 'em it's,
some kind of toxic algae bloom.

38:23.464 --> 38:25.433
-Tell 'em it's organic.
-My God.

38:25.467 --> 38:27.202
You both know that there's
tug of war in the water

38:27.235 --> 38:28.770
right now. We need
to get everyone out!

38:28.802 --> 38:30.538
Can you just listen?

38:30.572 --> 38:32.941
Let's go.
Open your eyes, man.

38:37.779 --> 38:39.748
Just don't say shark.

38:39.781 --> 38:41.817
You can't beat me at this, bro

38:41.850 --> 38:43.784
just like you never could
in grade school!

38:43.817 --> 38:46.587
I am and always will be stronger

38:46.621 --> 38:48.723
and better than you, bro,
every time.

38:48.755 --> 38:50.958
He must have eaten a lot
of paste when he was a kid.

38:50.991 --> 38:53.194
Yeah, I think the steroids are
shrinking more than his nuts.

38:53.228 --> 38:55.664
Come on, Ryan! Come on, big man!

38:55.697 --> 38:58.567
I'm a beast!
You can't beat a beast, brah.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.837
-Yeah, you can.
-He's like a cartoon character.

39:01.869 --> 39:02.971
Come on, beast!

39:05.706 --> 39:07.542
Three, two, one...

39:11.045 --> 39:13.548
Poor baby.

39:13.581 --> 39:16.885
-Audra, you're worthless.
-Sorry, Audra!

39:16.918 --> 39:19.154
Sam, what happened
to your muscles, Sam?

39:19.186 --> 39:20.621
Everybody get out of the water!

39:20.654 --> 39:22.056
Hey, everyone,
get out of the water!

39:22.089 --> 39:23.524
-Hey!
-I said, get out of the water!

39:23.558 --> 39:24.926
Hey, calm down, calm down!

39:24.958 --> 39:26.527
Please come out
of the water calmly

39:26.560 --> 39:28.128
we have an announcement to make.

39:29.596 --> 39:30.732
Shark! Get out of the water!

39:30.764 --> 39:32.199
-Run!
-Get out of the water!

39:34.134 --> 39:35.503
Take her!

39:40.975 --> 39:42.478
Come on, come on.

39:49.918 --> 39:51.286
-Guys, where's Ryan?
-Shit.

39:51.319 --> 39:52.853
I'm chained
to this boat, bro.

39:52.886 --> 39:54.054
Ryan, come on,
get out of the water!

39:54.087 --> 39:55.990
-I can't!
-Ryan!

39:56.023 --> 39:58.893
-I can't!
-Ryan? Ryan!

39:58.927 --> 40:02.664
Reese, go. Go, go, go!

40:02.697 --> 40:04.166
Ryan!

40:22.250 --> 40:24.152
Sharks? This isn't
what I signed up for.

40:24.185 --> 40:26.755
Hey, just give me 24 hours,
please.

40:26.788 --> 40:29.724
Jesse.
Hey, I need more towels.

40:29.757 --> 40:32.060
More towels. There's some
in the medical cabin.

40:32.092 --> 40:34.962
Keep pressure on that.
I'll be right back.

40:37.764 --> 40:39.567
-How are you doing?
-What the hell, guys?

40:39.601 --> 40:42.337
-What the hell? What the hell?
-I mean, what was that?

40:42.369 --> 40:44.205
It was a shark! What the hell
do you think it was?

40:44.237 --> 40:46.107
I've seen sharks.
That wasn't a shark.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.842
Well, it sure as hell
was acting like a shark.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.677
Well, who cares what it was?

40:49.710 --> 40:51.045
We need to get off
of this island.

40:51.078 --> 40:52.246
And I don't think
that idiot's gonna do

40:52.279 --> 40:53.747
anything to help us, okay?

40:53.781 --> 40:55.583
-I'm gonna go check on Gabby.
-Okay.

40:56.985 --> 40:58.853
Hello? Hello? Yeah. I...

40:58.886 --> 41:00.654
Please, can you...
No, I...

41:00.688 --> 41:02.590
Damn it, I can't
stay connected to anyone!

41:02.623 --> 41:04.625
Just keep trying,
it's a temporary outage.

41:04.659 --> 41:07.061
Maybe it's time to rethink this
whole off-the-grid strategy.

41:07.094 --> 41:08.362
What do you mean,
"This off-the-grid..."

41:08.395 --> 41:09.964
Can we start
thinking positive, please?

41:09.998 --> 41:11.866
I mean, let's get these people
off the island.

41:11.898 --> 41:14.335
Look around here, Reese,
and help me help you.

41:14.368 --> 41:17.638
-At least act like you care!
-What? You think I don't care?

41:17.672 --> 41:19.840
Of course, I care!
You don't think I care? Hey.

41:19.873 --> 41:21.875
Don't I care? You're having
a good time, right? I care.

41:21.909 --> 41:23.677
Don't I? Of course I care!
You're having a great time.

41:23.710 --> 41:24.913
Really hope that these guys
are coming up

41:24.946 --> 41:26.246
with a plan to get us
out of here.

41:26.279 --> 41:28.015
-I doubt it.
-Don't I care? Of course I care.

41:28.049 --> 41:29.317
I want to put this thing
together.

41:31.052 --> 41:32.621
I can't find Gabby.

41:44.031 --> 41:46.000
-Gabriella.
-Stay back.

41:46.034 --> 41:47.035
How long has she been here?

41:50.304 --> 41:52.173
-What?
-Wait. W-what is she saying?

41:52.206 --> 41:54.309
-What's wrong with her?
-She broke out in a fever.

41:54.342 --> 41:56.411
She keeps rambling on like
she's tripping out or something.

41:56.444 --> 41:58.346
No! No!

41:58.378 --> 42:00.114
-Stay down.
-You guys suck!

42:00.147 --> 42:02.383
I get to be the lead dancer.

42:02.417 --> 42:05.152
What? Gabriella? What is she
talking about? Lead dancer?

42:05.185 --> 42:07.221
We haven't danced since we were,
like, nine. What's happening?

42:07.255 --> 42:09.424
She's showing signs
of a really bad infection.

42:09.456 --> 42:11.426
What kind
of really bad infection?

42:11.458 --> 42:14.029
I don't know, but it's clearly
infecting her brain?

42:14.061 --> 42:15.730
You don't know?
Are you even a real doctor?

42:15.763 --> 42:17.331
I'm a medic!

42:17.364 --> 42:20.000
For a retreat that just had
a massive shark attack, okay

42:20.034 --> 42:22.837
I'm a little stressed
and-and a little overwhelmed!

42:22.869 --> 42:24.105
Well, that's our best friend,
so...

42:24.138 --> 42:25.940
Okay, is it possible
that that shark

42:25.973 --> 42:26.975
or whatever grazed her leg, it

42:27.007 --> 42:28.776
maybe it had some kind of poison

42:28.810 --> 42:30.878
or-or toxins that got
into her bloodstream?

42:30.911 --> 42:32.413
So wait. What,
it's like a toxic shark, Eden?

42:32.447 --> 42:33.915
-I don't know.
-Maybe, I don't know.

42:33.947 --> 42:35.683
It sure looked toxic to me.

42:35.717 --> 42:37.719
However, we need to get her
to a real hospital.

42:37.752 --> 42:39.020
-Okay?
-Yes, we do.

42:39.052 --> 42:40.321
We're trying to figure out
how to do that.

42:40.353 --> 42:41.790
I can't get through
to call for help.

42:41.822 --> 42:43.223
We can't just
bring her ourselves?

42:43.257 --> 42:44.826
We need to get the hell
off this island, man.

42:44.859 --> 42:45.860
-I know.
-All of us.

42:45.893 --> 42:47.061
It was all those years

42:47.094 --> 42:48.328
of polluting the ocean,
it's finally

42:48.362 --> 42:50.699
come back to bite us. Literally.

42:50.732 --> 42:51.933
Let's just focus on the shark

42:51.965 --> 42:53.768
and our injured friend here,
Eden.

42:53.801 --> 42:55.369
Zane is right.
We can't just stay here.

42:55.402 --> 42:57.471
We can't just kayak back,
not with that thing out there.

42:57.505 --> 43:00.375
Alright, settle down.
Settle down, let me take a look.

43:02.375 --> 43:03.711
She looks alright,
can't we just wait

43:03.744 --> 43:04.846
till after the weekend?

43:04.878 --> 43:06.848
No!
Get her off me!

43:06.880 --> 43:09.150
Get her off me, get her off me!
Okay, okay, okay.

43:10.351 --> 43:12.420
This is gonna ruin me.

43:14.154 --> 43:16.190
Okay, okay, I got, I got
two working boats.

43:16.223 --> 43:18.792
One working boat.

43:18.826 --> 43:20.360
You didn't fix the boat?

43:20.393 --> 43:21.830
Alright, I got, I got,
I got one boat.

43:21.862 --> 43:23.330
I can take her
and a few of the others

43:23.364 --> 43:25.066
and then I'll come back
and get the rest of you

43:25.098 --> 43:26.234
if you wanna get back
to the mainland.

43:26.266 --> 43:27.768
-Okay.
-Okay?

43:27.802 --> 43:29.404
We gotta make it quick.
It's low tide right now.

43:29.436 --> 43:32.172
I'll push the boat out, you get
the girl ready, meet me there.

43:32.206 --> 43:33.942
It'll take about 30 minutes
to get there and back.

43:33.975 --> 43:35.810
-Alright, hurry up.
-Come on.

43:35.842 --> 43:38.245
-It's okay, Gabby. Come on.
-You're gonna be okay.

43:47.154 --> 43:48.857
Come on, let's go.

43:48.889 --> 43:50.357
-It's too shallow. Just hurry.
-Give me your hand.

43:50.391 --> 43:52.460
-Come on, let's go.
-You should go, you and Audra.

43:52.493 --> 43:54.862
-What about you?
-I'll be okay.

43:54.895 --> 43:57.164
-Just make sure Gabby's okay.
-Whatever.

43:57.197 --> 44:00.033
-Here.
-Get 'em the boat.

44:00.067 --> 44:01.770
-What is she doing?
-What the hell?

44:03.837 --> 44:05.506
Dang it!

44:05.540 --> 44:08.509
-My God! She bit him!
-Come back.

44:08.543 --> 44:10.145
This is some crazy stuff.
What's going on?

44:10.177 --> 44:13.380
-Gabby? Gabby, no!
-You alright?

44:13.413 --> 44:14.815
-G-get him in the boat.
-Sam!

44:14.848 --> 44:16.450
-You okay?
-Gabby.

44:16.484 --> 44:19.319
Gabby, what are you doing?
Stop. It's me, it's Sam.

44:19.353 --> 44:22.157
-Man.
-Look at me, stop.

44:22.190 --> 44:24.025
Please, Gabby, stop it.

44:24.058 --> 44:25.793
Come on.
Get him in the boat.

44:25.826 --> 44:29.196
Please, please, stop,
please, Gabby.

44:29.230 --> 44:31.233
Look at me. Stop.

44:35.136 --> 44:36.404
-What are you doing?
-Get off the water.

44:36.436 --> 44:39.373
-Stop playing.
-Come on.

44:40.907 --> 44:43.444
-My!
-Get off the water!

44:43.476 --> 44:46.380
Go up! Eden, give me
your hand! Get off the water!

44:48.882 --> 44:51.018
-Hurry up!
-Reese!

44:51.052 --> 44:52.921
I'll shoot it
with a flare gun. No.

44:52.953 --> 44:55.355
What do you mean,
shoot it with a flare gun?

44:55.389 --> 44:59.928
Come on, come on. Come on.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.129
-What's he doing? He's leaving.
-Yeah.

45:02.163 --> 45:04.132
-Stop!
-Reese! Reese!

45:04.165 --> 45:06.567
-Where's he going?
-Where is he going?

45:06.601 --> 45:09.104
-Dang it! Reese!
-No!

45:12.572 --> 45:14.375
We should be taking 'em with us.

45:14.407 --> 45:16.009
Come on. I'm trying
to get us outta here.

45:16.043 --> 45:17.546
Hey, shut up! Will you?

45:20.581 --> 45:24.886
What's-what's going on?

45:24.918 --> 45:27.554
-Shit.
-Come on!

45:27.587 --> 45:29.456
-Come on!
-I'm trying! I'm trying!

45:29.489 --> 45:32.259
-Here, take the controls.
-Take the controls?

45:32.293 --> 45:33.595
I don't know anything
about boats.

45:33.627 --> 45:36.597
-What do you want me to do?
-Hold the wheel.

45:36.630 --> 45:38.933
-Are they coming back?
-Yeah, come on!

45:38.965 --> 45:41.335
-Come on, come on, come on!
-What are they doing?

45:41.368 --> 45:43.571
Alright, on three,
turn the gas. Pull the switch.

45:43.603 --> 45:47.609
I'm trying.
. Not now!

45:47.641 --> 45:49.344
-No.
-Shit.

45:50.677 --> 45:52.980
No!

45:53.014 --> 45:54.316
-No!
-No!

45:55.982 --> 45:57.417
No!

46:05.293 --> 46:07.262
-No!
-No!

46:07.295 --> 46:09.331
-No. No.
-No.

46:15.136 --> 46:16.338
My.

46:18.205 --> 46:20.375
-No. No.
-My God.

46:21.542 --> 46:23.011
Audra.

46:26.279 --> 46:29.516
Eden? Eden?

46:29.549 --> 46:31.551
Wait. This is Sam.
What are we gonna do?

46:31.585 --> 46:33.221
Audra was on that boat.

46:33.955 --> 46:35.156
Eden, what?

46:37.625 --> 46:40.061
What? Eden, spit it out.

46:40.094 --> 46:43.164
-Spit it out. What?
-Wait.

46:43.197 --> 46:44.999
-Wait.
-No, no, no, no! Stop!

46:45.031 --> 46:46.400
-Eden, Eden, Eden, come on now!
-Stop, stop!

46:46.433 --> 46:48.702
-Eden, Eden!
-Eden, come here!

46:48.735 --> 46:50.438
-No, stop it!
-No!

46:50.471 --> 46:52.273
Don't be crazy!
Don't be stupid, Eden.

46:52.306 --> 46:54.976
-Audra!
-God.

46:55.009 --> 46:57.279
Audra! She's right there!

46:59.647 --> 47:01.683
Audra! Audra!

47:03.183 --> 47:05.419
-Come on.
-I got you, I got you.

47:05.453 --> 47:07.487
Come on, come on.
I got you. Let's go.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.622
Come on. Let's go.

47:11.225 --> 47:13.493
Come on, come on, come on.

47:13.527 --> 47:15.130
CPR.

47:23.636 --> 47:26.373
-It's okay.
-Lay her down flat.

47:26.406 --> 47:28.609
Sit, sit, sit, sit,
sit, sit down.

47:35.348 --> 47:37.351
It's okay.

47:37.384 --> 47:38.518
Push this button
until I say stop.

47:38.552 --> 47:39.554
Okay, okay.

47:39.587 --> 47:41.289
I'm gonna go and get everything

47:41.322 --> 47:42.557
under control and get
everyone back to their cabins.

47:42.589 --> 47:44.358
Good idea.
Go find Liam and Hayden.

47:44.391 --> 47:45.460
-Please use your walkie.
-Right.

47:45.493 --> 47:47.027
Will she be okay?

47:50.230 --> 47:52.065
She's not okay, she's infected.

47:52.098 --> 47:54.401
-It's-it's not good.
-What, infected? That fast?

47:54.435 --> 47:55.703
-How do you know that?
-See where it is?

47:55.735 --> 47:57.471
It's closer to the brain

47:57.505 --> 47:59.674
it moves really fast,
just like rabies.

47:59.706 --> 48:01.375
-We're so screwed, man.
-That's good.

48:01.409 --> 48:02.777
-What the hell are we gonna do?
-Dude, calm down.

48:02.810 --> 48:05.279
You're not helping anything.

48:05.311 --> 48:07.482
You're the girl devil.

48:07.514 --> 48:09.717
-You're the devil!
-No, Audra, Audra, calm down!

48:09.750 --> 48:12.420
I'm Eden. I'm Eden, okay?
You're Audra.

48:12.453 --> 48:15.223
You're gonna be okay, alright?
Yeah, yeah, Eden.

48:15.255 --> 48:17.090
-Okay, Eden. Yeah.
-What the hell was that thing?

48:17.123 --> 48:18.725
I've never seen a shark
like that, man.

48:18.759 --> 48:20.261
Yeah, great,
'cause there's more where

48:20.293 --> 48:21.628
the great white shark
spits toxic waste!

48:21.661 --> 48:23.730
Hey, listen.
Of course, it matters, okay?

48:23.764 --> 48:25.700
But you need to calm down 'cause
we need to get outta here.

48:25.732 --> 48:28.235
Calm down? Calm down?
What are you talking about?

48:28.268 --> 48:31.505
-People are dying, man!
-Will you stop yelling, please?

48:31.538 --> 48:32.607
Stop it.

48:34.275 --> 48:36.110
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

48:36.143 --> 48:37.211
You will be fine.

48:40.781 --> 48:43.183
Liam, Hayden, you got them?

48:43.217 --> 48:46.554
Everyone who is not here,
back in their cabins. Okay?

48:46.587 --> 48:48.688
Alright, everybody, listen up.

48:48.721 --> 48:50.824
We are working
on an evacuation plan

48:50.857 --> 48:52.493
so everything's gonna be fine.

48:52.525 --> 48:54.561
We just need you guys
to stay inside your cabins

48:54.594 --> 48:56.730
at all times
until further notice.

48:56.764 --> 48:57.765
I'm gonna go back upstairs.

49:00.266 --> 49:01.636
Hayden, I got an idea.

49:01.668 --> 49:02.770
Okay.

49:05.873 --> 49:08.643
The thing is, guys,
there's only one boat left

49:08.676 --> 49:11.411
and it's not working.
It's leaking and something...

49:11.444 --> 49:12.779
So why don't we just fix it?

49:12.813 --> 49:14.816
I have no idea
'cause I am not a boat guy.

49:14.848 --> 49:17.551
Even if we did, getting on that
boat would be a suicide mission.

49:17.585 --> 49:19.454
We all saw what happened
to the other one.

49:19.487 --> 49:21.222
That's true

49:21.255 --> 49:24.392
but what if we're prepared?

49:24.424 --> 49:27.127
-That could work.
-Okay, so we get the boat going.

49:27.161 --> 49:28.663
We weapon up
and we fight our way to shore.

49:28.696 --> 49:30.764
Yeah. Who's volunteering
for that?

49:40.206 --> 49:41.409
I will.

49:42.275 --> 49:44.411
What? Sam, no.

49:44.444 --> 49:47.247
W-what if it doesn't work?
It probably won't. Okay?

49:47.281 --> 49:49.683
We need to focus on
getting the communication fixed.

49:49.717 --> 49:52.653
That would be great, except
the emergency landline is fried.

49:52.685 --> 49:54.688
Yeah, the cable washed up.
It's a mess.

49:54.721 --> 49:58.392
If you fix the lines,
you don't pay the fines.

49:59.826 --> 50:02.229
What's that supposed to mean?

50:02.263 --> 50:04.232
Phone company lineman.

50:04.264 --> 50:06.366
It's, like, my day job, dude.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.168
Wait, you do underwater
landline wiring?

50:08.201 --> 50:11.605
Hell no, not underwater.

50:11.639 --> 50:14.309
But I guess,
it's the same principle, right?

50:15.176 --> 50:16.543
Okay.

50:16.576 --> 50:17.712
Alright, Zane, why don't you
go with them,

50:17.744 --> 50:19.447
see if you can fix that line.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.516
-Cool.
-And I'll grab the scuba gear.

50:21.549 --> 50:23.817
-The what-a gear?
-Calm down, he's joking.

50:23.851 --> 50:25.820
-It's not that deep.
-Okay, we have walkies.

50:25.853 --> 50:27.588
Make sure you use them.

50:27.621 --> 50:28.756
Thanks, bruh.

50:28.788 --> 50:29.823
It's alright, man.

50:31.257 --> 50:33.393
Hey, you don't look so good.

50:33.427 --> 50:35.596
-Hey! You alright?
-I'm okay, I'm...

50:35.628 --> 50:37.864
I don't think I'm infected.

50:37.897 --> 50:39.600
Hey, Jesse, can you
show me that other boat?

50:39.632 --> 50:40.835
Yeah, let's do it.

50:40.868 --> 50:42.436
Yeah, I'll go with you guys.

50:42.469 --> 50:45.173
Hey, stay with Audra,
make sure she's okay.

50:45.206 --> 50:46.507
Yeah, okay.

50:46.540 --> 50:47.842
Hey, what do you know
about boats?

50:47.875 --> 50:49.243
My parents have a house
in Cape Cod.

50:49.275 --> 50:50.511
I grew up on boats.

50:50.543 --> 50:52.712
Okay, can you guys
just please hurry?

50:52.746 --> 50:55.150
You keep this prick on her side
of the room.

51:12.799 --> 51:14.301
That's not good.

51:14.335 --> 51:16.270
Actually, it's an easy fix.

51:16.302 --> 51:18.839
The engine looks fine.

51:18.871 --> 51:21.841
We just gotta patch up that hole
and pump out the water.

51:21.875 --> 51:23.545
Hey, Jesse, you can get me
a water pump?

51:33.319 --> 51:34.554
What's it look like?

51:34.587 --> 51:36.356
It looks like a pump, dude.

51:40.393 --> 51:43.397
-I got it.
-Yeah, that's it.

51:43.429 --> 51:45.600
Now we just gotta find something
to patch up that hole.

51:45.632 --> 51:47.234
Yeah, we need a repair kit.

51:48.701 --> 51:52.439
Wait. What in the hell?

51:52.473 --> 51:53.608
What? What is it?

51:53.641 --> 51:55.009
The hull.

51:55.042 --> 51:56.710
Looks like something
ate through the bottom.

51:56.743 --> 51:57.978
Ate?

51:59.480 --> 52:00.880
Corroded.

52:00.913 --> 52:03.250
This boat isn't that old,
doesn't make any sense.

52:03.284 --> 52:04.485
Not that anything does today.

52:05.786 --> 52:06.887
That shark.

52:06.920 --> 52:07.922
It's spewing out some kind of

52:07.955 --> 52:09.489
toxin into the water.

52:09.522 --> 52:10.523
Something that can eat away

52:10.556 --> 52:12.325
at the hull of a boat?

52:24.003 --> 52:25.706
It drifted pretty far.

52:25.739 --> 52:27.007
I thought you guys pulled it in.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.309
We did, it must have
drifted back out.

52:29.342 --> 52:30.877
Must have?

52:30.911 --> 52:32.380
Well, I guess that's that.

52:32.413 --> 52:33.981
-Let's go back.
-Come on, man.

52:34.014 --> 52:35.950
We got these,
and the water is clear.

52:35.982 --> 52:37.685
What are you smoking? I'm not
going back in that water.

52:37.717 --> 52:39.654
Hayden, just keep an eye on me.

52:39.686 --> 52:41.288
I got you.

52:41.322 --> 52:42.923
Seriously?

52:42.956 --> 52:44.925
My God,
you guys are so dumb.

52:44.958 --> 52:45.960
Here you go.

52:45.993 --> 52:48.061
Damn it! God!

52:48.094 --> 52:50.598
Come on, Zane,
you can do this.

52:50.630 --> 52:53.301
You can do this. Don't let
no fish destroy you, man.

52:53.333 --> 52:54.734
Come on, you gotta get out
of this island.

52:54.768 --> 52:57.538
Alright, alright, okay, alright.

53:00.107 --> 53:01.942
Alright. You got this.

53:01.975 --> 53:03.743
Alright. Just so you guys know,

53:03.777 --> 53:05.413
this is stupid.

53:06.513 --> 53:07.781
Even for me.

53:08.848 --> 53:10.917
Let's go.

53:10.951 --> 53:13.888
You guys know there's a shark
out there killing people, right?

53:13.920 --> 53:18.091
Craziness.
This water's cold.

53:18.125 --> 53:18.958
Man.

53:20.661 --> 53:22.663
Every boat should
have one somewhere.

53:22.696 --> 53:24.598
Jesse, check in the back.

53:24.630 --> 53:26.433
You know what?
Let me radio Eden.

53:27.534 --> 53:28.936
Eden, come in.

53:28.969 --> 53:30.905
Hey, I-I-I'm here. Are you okay?

53:30.938 --> 53:33.374
<i>Yeah, we're fine.
Can you find a repair kit?</i>

53:33.406 --> 53:34.741
A boat repair kit?

53:34.775 --> 53:36.043
That shark is corroding anything

53:36.076 --> 53:38.045
that sits in the water
long enough.

53:38.078 --> 53:40.014
I'll try.
There might be something here.

53:40.047 --> 53:42.616
-I don't know.
-I'm not going back there.

53:42.648 --> 53:44.884
And you can't make me.

53:44.918 --> 53:46.554
Sam, I gotta go.

53:49.723 --> 53:50.792
Jesse, any luck?

53:53.627 --> 53:55.429
It's okay, it's okay.

54:06.639 --> 54:09.076
I have to find something
to help you sleep.

54:09.109 --> 54:11.444
It's not fair that
we need to share a room.

54:11.478 --> 54:13.781
No! You clean the damn room!

54:15.148 --> 54:17.351
I'm not covering for you again.

54:22.822 --> 54:24.424
What's this?

54:29.630 --> 54:30.831
Audra?

54:32.699 --> 54:33.835
I'll be right back.

54:40.808 --> 54:42.510
Keep a lookout
for that shark, man.

54:42.543 --> 54:43.911
Is that a jellyfish?

54:46.712 --> 54:47.915
Let's go under.

55:02.061 --> 55:03.498
Over here.

55:06.933 --> 55:08.668
-You got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

55:08.701 --> 55:10.870
But this thing
is beyond repair, guys.

55:10.904 --> 55:12.572
Let's get out of the water,
yeah?

55:12.605 --> 55:14.141
If you wanna bring it back,
come on.

55:15.875 --> 55:17.944
Shark!

55:17.978 --> 55:19.447
Let's go!

55:20.714 --> 55:21.748
-Liam!
-Hayden!

55:21.781 --> 55:23.049
-Liam!
-Help me!

55:25.018 --> 55:26.587
-Hayden!
-Liam!

55:26.619 --> 55:28.656
-Liam! Liam!
-Hayden!

55:28.688 --> 55:29.790
-Liam!
-Liam!

55:30.223 --> 55:31.625
Liam!

55:33.092 --> 55:35.728
No, no!

55:35.761 --> 55:36.797
Let go of it!

55:42.201 --> 55:44.103
Man! We're going.

55:44.136 --> 55:45.605
My God, your leg.

55:45.639 --> 55:47.141
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

55:47.174 --> 55:48.609
God! God!

55:48.641 --> 55:49.844
Come on, hold on.

55:49.877 --> 55:52.179
This is so...
This is crazy, man.

55:52.212 --> 55:55.516
-What... Come on, hold on.
-Liam.

55:58.217 --> 56:00.520
Liam! Liam!

56:00.554 --> 56:01.589
Liam, forget him!

56:48.569 --> 56:49.936
Of course not.

56:54.107 --> 56:55.775
Where are you?

56:58.779 --> 57:00.248
Where were you?

57:12.292 --> 57:14.194
Jesse?

57:14.226 --> 57:15.929
Hey, man, you okay?

57:15.962 --> 57:18.131
Jesse, hey.

57:20.266 --> 57:22.969
-That girl bit him, but...
-Who are you to judge me?

57:23.002 --> 57:24.837
Jesse!

57:24.871 --> 57:26.773
I don't need you to judge...

57:48.728 --> 57:51.130
No. No!

57:51.163 --> 57:53.933
Good news is that
it's temporary.

58:05.244 --> 58:07.281
You're too stupid
to go to medical school.

58:08.214 --> 58:10.116
No, you're too lazy.

58:19.058 --> 58:20.127
Thanks.

58:20.159 --> 58:21.862
He was bit by your friend.

58:21.895 --> 58:23.097
Great.

58:23.130 --> 58:24.898
So that's the thing now.

58:24.931 --> 58:27.001
If it's anything like rabies,

58:27.034 --> 58:28.669
it would explain their behavior.

58:30.871 --> 58:33.407
-What are you doing?
-I'm tying him up.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.976
We don't have time on the water.
We'll leave him on the land.

58:36.009 --> 58:37.311
Let's just get him back
to medical.

58:37.344 --> 58:38.378
God.

59:08.775 --> 59:10.343
Arsenic?

59:18.884 --> 59:20.186
Eden!

59:20.219 --> 59:22.889
-Where are they?
-I don't know.

59:22.922 --> 59:25.024
-Come on.
-Here, help him down.

59:27.293 --> 59:29.897
Pride goes before the fall.

59:29.929 --> 59:30.964
What?

59:30.996 --> 59:33.000
I was taking a bush pee

59:33.032 --> 59:35.735
and a humdinger
of a horse fight.

59:35.768 --> 59:37.170
Dinged on my dinger!

59:39.940 --> 59:41.008
Eden, come in.

59:41.975 --> 59:43.277
-Eden?
-Bobby!

59:43.310 --> 59:44.779
She forgot her walkie.

59:46.378 --> 59:47.915
-Alright, what do we do with...
-Bobby!

59:47.947 --> 59:49.215
I don't know, he's the medic.

59:49.248 --> 59:50.984
No, Bobby.
It's your turn to give

59:51.016 --> 59:52.819
Grandma her sitz bath.

59:54.286 --> 59:56.889
-Was that necessary?
-Yeah, I think so.

59:56.922 --> 59:58.725
Jesse?

59:58.759 --> 01:00:00.293
What happened to her?

01:00:00.326 --> 01:00:02.328
God!

01:00:02.362 --> 01:00:03.997
I was aiming for the shark.
It was right there.

01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:05.965
-I don't know what to do.
-Wh-where's Liam?

01:00:05.998 --> 01:00:07.333
That thing, it got him.

01:00:08.835 --> 01:00:10.137
There's so much happening.

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:11.205
Something that happened again.

01:00:11.237 --> 01:00:14.373
Yeah, I don't really know.

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:16.042
Guys...

01:00:16.076 --> 01:00:17.811
This is so bad!

01:00:17.844 --> 01:00:19.346
-Yeah...
-This is so freaking bad!

01:00:19.378 --> 01:00:21.380
-Hold it, come on.
-I didn't mean this.

01:00:21.413 --> 01:00:23.984
"Minor cuts."
"Burns stay through..."

01:00:24.016 --> 01:00:26.319
Can someone
please help me with this?

01:00:26.353 --> 01:00:28.522
-Alright. Hold it.
-I'm gonna find Eden.

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:31.958
Hey, come on, be here.
Calm down!

01:00:31.991 --> 01:00:34.327
-Help me. The dog is tied up.
-So much blood.

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:15.569
-Do you, you wanna...
-Nope. You got it.

01:01:15.601 --> 01:01:18.237
Hayden, Hayden, listen to me.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.206
The, the harpoon is barbed.

01:01:20.239 --> 01:01:22.208
-I can't just pull it out.
-What does that mean?

01:01:22.241 --> 01:01:24.844
It means that I, I have to...

01:01:24.877 --> 01:01:27.180
No, no, no.
No, no, no. It's not that bad.

01:01:27.214 --> 01:01:28.315
It's not... No!

01:01:28.348 --> 01:01:30.384
-Be brave, alright?
-Okay.

01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:32.418
Okay. Three, two!

01:01:34.855 --> 01:01:36.590
Come on!

01:01:51.638 --> 01:01:53.574
I'll show those bitches.

01:02:45.991 --> 01:02:47.060
Sam!

01:02:51.264 --> 01:02:52.299
Go, go, go! Go.

01:02:55.668 --> 01:02:57.003
Why the hell did it turn around?

01:02:57.036 --> 01:02:58.038
My bracelet, I think

01:02:58.071 --> 01:02:59.438
i-it doesn't like the magnets.

01:03:12.485 --> 01:03:14.288
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:03:14.321 --> 01:03:16.023
No, Sam, I was just
trying to test it...

01:03:16.056 --> 01:03:17.557
You were just trying to what?
You went in the water!

01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:19.058
No, I needed
to get by the wreckage.

01:03:19.092 --> 01:03:20.394
-Why, why?
-Stop, Sam.

01:03:20.427 --> 01:03:22.996
You always interrupt me.
You never let me finish.

01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:24.130
It's like you hate me
or something.

01:03:24.163 --> 01:03:25.165
I don't hate you, Eden.

01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:26.366
If I hated you, I wouldn't be

01:03:26.398 --> 01:03:28.134
in the water
trying to save you.

01:03:37.978 --> 01:03:40.514
Is that from the explosion?

01:03:40.547 --> 01:03:41.615
No, they're-they're
chemical burns.

01:03:41.647 --> 01:03:43.182
There's something different.

01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:44.650
Like, the other boat?

01:03:44.683 --> 01:03:47.321
No, that was,
that was just erosion.

01:03:48.621 --> 01:03:50.190
This is something more violent.

01:03:50.223 --> 01:03:53.027
It's like chemical spraying
or something.

01:03:57.297 --> 01:03:59.632
You even bring your work
on vacation, Eden.

01:03:59.665 --> 01:04:03.970
No, it's-it's not mine. I got
it from the equipment shed.

01:04:04.003 --> 01:04:06.739
-What is it? A pool kit?
-It's not a swimming pool kit.

01:04:06.772 --> 01:04:09.175
You don't test for arsenic
in a swimming pool.

01:04:19.386 --> 01:04:20.420
Eden...

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:26.993
I'm sorry.

01:04:27.027 --> 01:04:30.230
-I'm sorry we didn't...
-No, no, it's-it's-it's okay.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.735
I'm sorry, too.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.162
I still just can't believe
this whole thing.

01:05:02.194 --> 01:05:05.464
I know, we just need to focus
on the source.

01:05:05.498 --> 01:05:08.034
And how long
has Audra been missing?

01:05:08.067 --> 01:05:10.169
I don't know. She was gone
when I got back with Jesse.

01:05:27.386 --> 01:05:28.522
What happened here?

01:05:28.554 --> 01:05:30.456
Don't ask.

01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:32.692
-How you doing?
-I'll be fine.

01:05:32.725 --> 01:05:35.228
-You found her?
-Audra?

01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:38.565
I didn't see her. She's probably
gone full Gabby by now.

01:05:38.598 --> 01:05:42.235
-What?
-And him.

01:05:42.268 --> 01:05:45.739
-Zane, can he talk?
-Yeah, but it's all crazy talk.

01:05:45.772 --> 01:05:49.708
And I'm not taking the tape
off his mouth. He bites.

01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:53.112
-Yeah, I wouldn't get too close.
-This is so screwed up.

01:05:53.145 --> 01:05:54.680
I don't understand
what the hell is going on.

01:05:54.714 --> 01:05:57.217
-Go ahead, tell 'em.
-Tell us what?

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.485
Okay, so, we found
this water-testing kit.

01:05:59.518 --> 01:06:01.388
And it's the same type of kit
they use after there's been

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.656
an oil spill or some kind
of bio-hazardous leak

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:04.724
from a chemical plant.

01:06:04.757 --> 01:06:06.525
Yeah, we found that at the dock.

01:06:06.558 --> 01:06:08.561
I knew it was too good
to be true.

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:10.230
Singles' retreat.

01:06:10.263 --> 01:06:13.433
All-inclusive hot girls?
Pfft. Please.

01:06:13.465 --> 01:06:14.868
Okay, so it's just a theory

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.502
but I think
it's whatever's in the water

01:06:16.536 --> 01:06:17.838
that's making that shark toxic.

01:06:17.871 --> 01:06:19.506
Wait, we've been swimming
on this beach

01:06:19.538 --> 01:06:21.674
for a really long time. How come
we've never gotten sick?

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:23.510
But we haven't been
in the water long enough

01:06:23.543 --> 01:06:25.745
for the chemicals to have
any long-lasting effect

01:06:25.777 --> 01:06:27.246
but i-if the shark bites us

01:06:27.279 --> 01:06:28.281
it's gonna get
in our blood stream

01:06:28.313 --> 01:06:30.484
and then, well...

01:06:30.516 --> 01:06:32.551
-Then Audra.
-Right.

01:06:32.585 --> 01:06:35.522
So this shark is oozing
some concentration of arsenic.

01:06:35.554 --> 01:06:37.424
I don't know how
it's immune to it

01:06:37.456 --> 01:06:40.826
but if it grazes anything, that
thing becomes violent and crazy.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.796
And the first sign
of arsenic poisoning,

01:06:42.828 --> 01:06:44.630
it's confusion and convulsion.

01:06:44.663 --> 01:06:46.699
So we need to get off
this damn island.

01:06:46.732 --> 01:06:49.335
Is there any chance that Reese
had a boat-repair kit somewhere?

01:06:49.368 --> 01:06:51.837
Yeah. There should be one
around back by the tool shed.

01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:55.242
Okay. Sam, Zane,
you guys get the boat fixed.

01:06:55.275 --> 01:06:58.478
-Eden and I will go find Audra.
-Yes.

01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:01.315
Let's go, guys.
Hayden, we'll be back for you.

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:26.906
-What's takin' so long, man?
-I'm almost done.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.442
-Doing a two-man job here.
-I'm keeping lookout.

01:07:29.475 --> 01:07:31.344
Yeah, you could get
your ass down here and help me.

01:07:31.377 --> 01:07:34.181
To hell with that. I ain't
gettin' in this water again.

01:07:34.214 --> 01:07:36.183
Dude, I'm not staying on this
island and getting that disease.

01:07:36.215 --> 01:07:37.918
I'm sure as hell not getting
killed by that shark.

01:07:37.951 --> 01:07:40.387
We are leaving on this boat,
so you get down here...

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.889
Fine! God!

01:07:42.922 --> 01:07:45.792
You and your dumb girl problems.
Give me that stupid paintbrush.

01:07:58.003 --> 01:07:59.471
Shit! What the hell!

01:07:59.505 --> 01:08:00.574
It's coming for us. Hold on.

01:08:05.578 --> 01:08:08.982
Zane! Zane!

01:08:09.014 --> 01:08:10.250
Come on, man.

01:08:14.587 --> 01:08:16.921
Zane! Zane, come on!

01:08:16.956 --> 01:08:19.292
Come on, man.

01:08:19.325 --> 01:08:20.961
Help me! No!

01:08:20.993 --> 01:08:22.395
No! I don't wanna die!

01:08:24.363 --> 01:08:25.799
Can't swim fast.
Come on, give me your hand.

01:08:25.831 --> 01:08:28.935
Come on! Come on! Zane, come on!

01:08:28.968 --> 01:08:31.871
Come on! Come on.

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:32.938
Yeah.

01:08:32.971 --> 01:08:35.008
Come out.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.542
Sam, it bit my leg.

01:08:37.576 --> 01:08:38.810
Man, I'm bleeding.

01:08:41.346 --> 01:08:43.383
Come on, get this thing started.

01:08:43.415 --> 01:08:45.517
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:08:45.551 --> 01:08:46.819
This is what
you've been waiting for.

01:08:51.057 --> 01:08:53.227
It's okay, man, hang on.

01:08:56.328 --> 01:08:57.630
Where are we goin'?

01:08:57.663 --> 01:08:58.865
I'm gettin' us
away from the shark, man.

01:08:58.897 --> 01:08:59.898
But what about Eden
and everyone?

01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:01.667
-I know, man.
-Man...

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.902
Let me just figure it out.

01:09:07.706 --> 01:09:09.542
Audra!

01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:11.344
-Audra!
-Audra!

01:09:11.377 --> 01:09:12.712
Audra, it's Eden!

01:09:12.745 --> 01:09:14.613
-Where the hell is she?
-I don't know.

01:09:14.645 --> 01:09:16.548
But it's a small island,
she couldn't have gone that far.

01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:18.517
Well, if it's really arsenic
poisoning, we don't really...

01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:19.953
-No, stop.
-What?

01:09:19.986 --> 01:09:21.388
Well, I know
what you're gonna say.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.888
And, no, I don't give up
on my friends.

01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:24.991
Okay, that's really admirable,
Eden, but you're wrong.

01:09:25.023 --> 01:09:27.294
What I was going to say is that

01:09:27.326 --> 01:09:29.361
maybe instead of burning
daylight looking for Audra

01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:31.497
we should go to the boat
and come back with the cavalry.

01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:33.432
Okay, but let's just
check the cabins first

01:09:33.465 --> 01:09:34.734
and then we can double-back
to the boats.

01:09:34.767 --> 01:09:35.836
Yeah.

01:09:37.469 --> 01:09:38.971
I just really hope
they get that boat fixed.

01:09:39.004 --> 01:09:41.607
No, Sam grew up on boats.
He knows what he's doing.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.676
Even if he does,
with that shark out there,

01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:46.011
we might as well be
in an inflatable pool toy.

01:09:46.044 --> 01:09:47.380
Yeah.

01:09:50.982 --> 01:09:52.917
What?

01:09:52.951 --> 01:09:54.954
Where do you guys
keep your yoga equipment?

01:10:32.491 --> 01:10:34.360
So, what are we looking for?

01:10:37.163 --> 01:10:39.965
-These.
-Therapy magnets?

01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:43.136
The ionization of the salt water
with these magnets

01:10:43.169 --> 01:10:45.472
will send out
an electromagnetic pulse

01:10:45.504 --> 01:10:47.773
that will drive the shark crazy.

01:10:47.807 --> 01:10:50.710
-Even a toxic one.
-Are you sure?

01:10:50.743 --> 01:10:53.746
Well, all these small magnets,
they saved my life.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.617
So, maybe with these
big magnets,

01:10:57.650 --> 01:10:58.785
we'll have a shot.

01:10:58.817 --> 01:10:59.886
Okay.

01:11:02.722 --> 01:11:04.391
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:11:04.423 --> 01:11:06.426
-God. Zane, your leg.
-I know, I know!

01:11:06.459 --> 01:11:08.128
Just keep going.
Don't worry about my leg.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.129
-Here, just use this rag, man.
-What the hell is this?

01:11:10.163 --> 01:11:11.498
This is disgusting.

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:13.132
I don't care. Just tie it up.

01:11:16.067 --> 01:11:17.870
Come on, man, go faster.

01:11:17.904 --> 01:11:19.039
I know, dude.

01:11:28.114 --> 01:11:29.782
-This is crazy.
-I don't know.

01:11:29.816 --> 01:11:32.485
-It could work.
-I don't know, I just...

01:11:34.152 --> 01:11:35.489
Audra?

01:11:37.557 --> 01:11:40.059
Audra? Audra?

01:11:40.092 --> 01:11:41.495
Audra!

01:11:43.896 --> 01:11:45.331
Run! Run!

01:11:51.471 --> 01:11:53.705
My God, they're all
in a frenzy!

01:11:53.739 --> 01:11:55.542
-Come on!
-Zane, keep your eyes out.

01:11:55.575 --> 01:11:57.644
Do you see him?

01:11:57.677 --> 01:12:00.547
-I don't know, man.
-No. Where did he go?

01:12:00.579 --> 01:12:04.183
-Damn, this shark is fast.
-Go faster!

01:12:04.217 --> 01:12:06.686
Man, this is as fast as this
little skiff will go. Come on.

01:12:08.553 --> 01:12:09.788
Well, there he is!

01:12:09.821 --> 01:12:11.190
Hold on, Sam.

01:12:13.191 --> 01:12:15.661
No. Are you kidding me?

01:12:15.695 --> 01:12:18.063
Did you date the shark, too?
Come on, get it started!

01:12:18.097 --> 01:12:19.165
Man, I'm trying.
This is a process.

01:12:19.197 --> 01:12:20.901
Hurry up that process, man!

01:12:24.536 --> 01:12:27.206
No, no, no. Come on, Sam.
Come on, man. Hurry up!

01:12:31.977 --> 01:12:33.579
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming.

01:12:39.685 --> 01:12:41.087
Hold on!

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.189
Get down!

01:12:57.303 --> 01:12:58.538
Where'd he go?

01:13:02.741 --> 01:13:06.079
Sam! Sam, come in! Sam!

01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:08.514
-Zane, where did he go, man?
-Who the hell cares, man?

01:13:08.548 --> 01:13:09.715
Just get it started so we can...

01:13:11.249 --> 01:13:12.685
<i>Sam... Alright?</i>

01:13:12.718 --> 01:13:14.053
What's that?

01:13:14.085 --> 01:13:15.821
<i>Audra...</i>

01:13:18.257 --> 01:13:20.259
<i>-Eden, is that you?
-Sam!</i>

01:13:20.293 --> 01:13:22.829
<i>-Are you okay? Where are you?
-Look! We're back at the beach!</i>

01:13:23.795 --> 01:13:24.897
Sam!

01:13:28.301 --> 01:13:30.904
Eden, run. Run, Eden.

01:13:30.937 --> 01:13:32.972
-Sam...
-Run!

01:13:33.004 --> 01:13:34.206
Come on!

01:13:45.284 --> 01:13:46.553
God.

01:13:59.865 --> 01:14:01.601
Run! I mean, they're right
behind you!

01:14:01.633 --> 01:14:02.668
Come on!

01:14:17.749 --> 01:14:19.886
-Keep your eyes on 'em, Zane.
-Really?

01:14:19.919 --> 01:14:21.588
What else was I to do,
take selfies?

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.155
Run! Run!

01:14:23.188 --> 01:14:25.991
-You did this!
-Audra!

01:14:26.025 --> 01:14:27.127
Come on! Swim!

01:14:51.316 --> 01:14:53.185
My God.

01:14:53.218 --> 01:14:55.221
Come on. Come on.

01:15:15.173 --> 01:15:16.676
-Come on, swim.
-Come on.

01:15:18.044 --> 01:15:19.812
-Swim faster!
-Come on, come on.

01:15:19.844 --> 01:15:21.146
-Come on.
-They're right behind you.

01:15:24.683 --> 01:15:26.018
Come on!

01:15:41.232 --> 01:15:42.668
Give me the bag!

01:15:45.236 --> 01:15:47.039
I hope you're right about those.

01:15:47.072 --> 01:15:48.107
Yeah, me too.

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:56.214
Did it work?

01:15:56.248 --> 01:15:58.317
I don't know. I don't see him.

01:16:02.954 --> 01:16:04.790
Guys, he's coming back.

01:16:06.392 --> 01:16:07.994
-Everyone, duck!
-Watch out!

01:16:14.866 --> 01:16:15.968
Is it gone?

01:16:18.737 --> 01:16:20.440
-Anyone see it?
-I don't.

01:16:20.472 --> 01:16:22.040
I think it's gone.

01:16:22.074 --> 01:16:24.177
But where'd it go?

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:25.477
-Come on.
-Come on, Sam.

01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:27.914
-Get this thing started.
-I'm trying, man.

01:16:27.946 --> 01:16:31.150
-Try harder.
-Come on, please start. Come on!

01:16:33.285 --> 01:16:35.121
Yes! Finally!

01:16:35.154 --> 01:16:37.056
Let's get out of here, dude.

01:16:37.088 --> 01:16:38.691
Everyone, keep an eye out.

01:16:43.963 --> 01:16:45.798
No, it's smoking.

01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:47.365
Yo, ease on the engine,
or you'll blow it out.

01:16:47.398 --> 01:16:49.000
Man, we're running on fumes,
so if we stall out

01:16:49.034 --> 01:16:50.036
we're dead in the water.

01:16:50.069 --> 01:16:51.137
The mainland's that way.

01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:53.472
I told you, dude.

01:16:54.874 --> 01:16:56.743
It's that shark goo, it's...

01:17:01.112 --> 01:17:02.949
Fire! Fire!

01:17:02.981 --> 01:17:04.484
-Alright, come on!
-Come on.

01:17:04.517 --> 01:17:07.220
-Hurry!
-It's not going out, guys.

01:17:07.253 --> 01:17:08.755
Throw out the water!

01:17:10.889 --> 01:17:12.258
Come on, keep throwing!

01:17:17.029 --> 01:17:20.232
That's just great.
What are we supposed to do now?

01:17:20.266 --> 01:17:22.000
It's gonna start
getting dark soon.

01:17:22.034 --> 01:17:25.071
Well, we're shark bait floating
in the water like this.

01:17:25.103 --> 01:17:26.806
-What about the magnets?
-Magnets?

01:17:26.838 --> 01:17:28.173
They might buy us some time

01:17:28.206 --> 01:17:30.142
but the shark's just gonna get
more pissed off.

01:17:30.176 --> 01:17:34.379
-Yeah, swimming for it's out.
-We're gonna end up like that.

01:17:34.413 --> 01:17:37.183
-That's Reese's boat.
-Was Reese's boat.

01:17:37.215 --> 01:17:39.118
That doesn't inspire confidence,
Zane.

01:17:39.151 --> 01:17:40.820
Do you think that flare gun
is still down there?

01:17:40.852 --> 01:17:45.123
Down there? Maybe.
God. What are you thinkin'?

01:17:45.156 --> 01:17:47.192
Whatever's in that shark,
it has a ton of arsenic in it.

01:17:47.226 --> 01:17:49.562
-Who the hell cares?
-Arsenic is highly flammable.

01:17:49.594 --> 01:17:51.798
-Okay?
-Will that work?

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:54.967
Yeah. I mean, it lit up
that shark pus, so...

01:17:54.999 --> 01:17:57.936
-Yeah, why not?
-What do we do now?

01:17:57.969 --> 01:18:00.139
We dive down there
and hope to God it works.

01:18:04.243 --> 01:18:07.112
Right. What happens when our
friend decides to swim back up?

01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:26.432
You guys think this
is a good idea?

01:18:26.464 --> 01:18:29.034
No, but it's all we got.

01:18:34.138 --> 01:18:35.208
Come on.

01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:39.279
Are we ready?

01:18:41.614 --> 01:18:45.819
One, two, three.

01:18:47.652 --> 01:18:49.188
Okay, but just go slow, Sam.

01:18:58.998 --> 01:19:00.200
Ready?

01:19:36.035 --> 01:19:38.338
God, it's back.
Zane, it's back.

01:19:39.338 --> 01:19:41.507
God. Zane.

01:19:43.508 --> 01:19:44.543
Zane!

01:19:55.087 --> 01:19:56.255
Get off!

01:20:43.768 --> 01:20:45.503
Give us your hand!

01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:46.571
Here.

01:20:53.178 --> 01:20:54.948
What happened to Zane?

01:20:56.781 --> 01:20:59.651
I'm sorry, I...
He tried to bite me.

01:20:59.685 --> 01:21:01.053
Look, Sam,
okay, we need to focus.

01:21:01.085 --> 01:21:03.121
Okay? Because that thing
is in a frenzy.

01:21:03.155 --> 01:21:05.257
Once it's done with Zane, it's
gonna come right back for us.

01:21:05.289 --> 01:21:06.491
Come on!

01:21:08.694 --> 01:21:11.062
-Alright.
-There's only three?

01:21:11.096 --> 01:21:12.197
Yeah! Make 'em count.

01:21:18.236 --> 01:21:19.504
Come on. Hurry, Sam.

01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:26.179
No! Shit!

01:21:27.079 --> 01:21:28.114
Come on.

01:21:30.648 --> 01:21:31.683
Come on.

01:21:33.685 --> 01:21:35.420
Here it comes!

01:21:35.454 --> 01:21:36.723
Load the gun Sam, hurry!

01:21:38.456 --> 01:21:40.093
Okay, wait till it gets closer.

01:21:40.726 --> 01:21:42.161
Hold...

01:21:43.762 --> 01:21:45.164
Hold...

01:21:46.597 --> 01:21:49.134
Hold... Now!

01:21:55.139 --> 01:21:56.342
Shit!

01:22:01.312 --> 01:22:02.647
No, he's coming back.

01:22:02.681 --> 01:22:03.750
Come on.

01:22:05.584 --> 01:22:07.653
Come on, Sam.
This is our last flare.

01:22:10.188 --> 01:22:11.656
Take this shot, Sam.

01:22:19.431 --> 01:22:20.500
Erin!

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.602
Where'd she go?

01:22:26.137 --> 01:22:27.238
We're out of flares.

01:22:27.271 --> 01:22:28.807
Here! Take the magnet.

01:22:34.112 --> 01:22:35.647
There.

01:22:35.681 --> 01:22:36.715
-Come on.
-Come on.

01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:39.451
Come on.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.475
Where's he?

01:23:15.187 --> 01:23:17.590
-Look!
-God.

01:23:17.623 --> 01:23:18.758
God.

01:23:20.825 --> 01:23:23.495
One, two, go!

01:23:32.838 --> 01:23:35.475
-I found the shell!
-Come here!

01:23:37.476 --> 01:23:38.678
Give it!

01:23:42.847 --> 01:23:45.183
Smile, you toxic son of a...

01:24:05.904 --> 01:24:08.240
We got it, guys!

01:24:08.272 --> 01:24:10.476
-My God.
-Is everybody okay?

01:24:10.508 --> 01:24:11.576
-Yes.
-Yeah?

01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:12.844
Good shot!

01:24:12.878 --> 01:24:14.947
Somebody had to do it.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.581
-Grab on to something.
-Okay.

01:24:16.615 --> 01:24:18.417
-Have to swim for it.
-Alright.

01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:10.902
Let's just take it slow
this time, okay?

01:25:10.936 --> 01:25:14.273
Okay. Okay.

01:25:16.407 --> 01:25:19.945
-I'm just glad we're alive.
-Yeah.

01:25:25.484 --> 01:25:26.485
No!
