10:17.665 --> 10:20.345

10:28.647 --> 10:30.703

songs and keep us save.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.739

11:10.642 --> 11:12.622

11:58.975 --> 12:00.461
I need you.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.371

14:07.426 --> 14:10.691

since we've seen you.

14:10.692 --> 14:12.543
Yes, sorry.

14:12.544 --> 14:15.826
He's fooling father,
fooling and fornicating.

14:15.827 --> 14:19.274
His friends, his girlfriend.
They are bad for him.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.245

14:28.893 --> 14:34.064
Thomas, I expect you to say that
your friends are not so bad.

14:34.445 --> 14:38.645
They love you and they are there for you
in times of need, no matter waht.

14:38.646 --> 14:40.130

14:41.873 --> 14:44.385

14:54.713 --> 14:56.877

14:56.878 --> 15:00.417
That first step into a wider world.

15:00.418 --> 15:02.908
- That's Star Wars.
- Excuse me?

15:02.909 --> 15:06.044
Obi-Wan Kenobi says that after
Luke gets shot by the floaty-thing.

15:06.045 --> 15:06.979
Obi-Wan?

15:06.980 --> 15:12.151
"Well done Luka, you have taken
your first step into a wider world."

15:15.049 --> 15:16.864
- That's good.
- Yes,

15:16.865 --> 15:20.596
because Obi-Wan Kenobi is like
God, but with better weapons.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.327
Obi-Wan Kenobi rules.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.791

17:36.744 --> 17:38.939

18:30.141 --> 18:33.030

This is fucked up, I didn't even know the girl.

19:28.746 --> 19:30.522

19:30.523 --> 19:33.878

26:30.381 --> 26:32.713
Thomas, welcome.

26:35.218 --> 26:39.370
Oh, hey. Cool. This is Thomas, dad.

26:39.972 --> 26:43.610
Oh yes.
I know who he is.

26:47.176 --> 26:49.421
It's coming out.

26:49.422 --> 26:53.631
Quiet! Everybody, quiet!

26:55.608 --> 26:57.339
Everybody.

26:57.838 --> 27:00.831
Everybody, Jesus.
Get shut up!

27:01.873 --> 27:05.306
Now we were just about to sing a song, weren't we?
So what shpuld we sing?

27:05.307 --> 27:06.989
- Rihanna!
- Lady Gaga!

27:06.990 --> 27:08.236
Beyoncé!

27:08.237 --> 27:10.710
Thoose ar all people,
who can't really sing,

27:10.711 --> 27:13.762
don't wear very many clothes
and get married far too young.

27:13.763 --> 27:15.627
What do we call that sorts of people?

27:15.628 --> 27:20.101
- Americans!
- That's right, americans.

27:20.102 --> 27:21.657
Now listen.

27:41.406 --> 27:42.976
What?

27:42.977 --> 27:45.558
- Come on, sing.
- Sing, sucker!

28:47.480 --> 28:49.065
Enjoying yourself?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.692
Yes, it's fun.

28:52.279 --> 28:53.658
I'm wondering...

28:54.245 --> 28:58.295
How is it you spend over year
at the same colleage as my daughter,

28:58.682 --> 29:00.044
and only just met?

29:01.385 --> 29:03.439
- I don't know.
- I do, Thomas.

29:04.707 --> 29:08.392
After I spoke to you,
you started noticing things, dind't you?

29:08.932 --> 29:11.925
Things that have always been there,
but you have never seen.

29:13.950 --> 29:16.485
I suppose.
She's beautiful.

29:17.765 --> 29:21.509
- She is a beautiful singer.
- She is. She serves the Lord.

29:22.333 --> 29:26.124
If you put your trust in him
and obay his rules,

29:26.534 --> 29:30.443
you see the world in a
new way, it's wonderful.

29:31.868 --> 29:32.616
Just...

29:33.672 --> 29:38.000
Open up your heart, Thomas
and give me your soul.

29:39.996 --> 29:41.565
Give it to me.

29:45.995 --> 29:49.677
Thomas, Daniel's sick. Thomas!

29:50.572 --> 29:51.995
Oh, my God.

29:52.377 --> 29:54.372
Daniel, sit up.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.041
It's okay.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.978
It's okay, Daniel. I got you.

30:02.637 --> 30:05.626
Lung infection.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.615
Is he okay?

30:09.037 --> 30:10.743
- Daniel.
- He's fine,

30:10.744 --> 30:13.182
Mrs Tomoni

30:13.183 --> 30:16.615
I told you to look after them,
what did you do to my baby,

30:16.616 --> 30:18.265
Mum, I brought him to
Pastor Babajide's house.

30:18.266 --> 30:21.034
It concernes me that this is
the third incident in six weeks

30:21.035 --> 30:22.355
So?

30:22.356 --> 30:24.661
Now I'm just saying,
if there is an environmental factor,

30:24.662 --> 30:27.045
if´your house is damp or dusty...

30:27.046 --> 30:28.916
- My house is clear.
- Yes, right,

30:28.905 --> 30:30.876
but he shouldn't be here this often.

30:30.877 --> 30:34.177
I look after my children, you can mind your own buisness.

30:34.178 --> 30:37.616
Mum, the house is dump.
There's mold and walls are wet.

30:39.427 --> 30:41.720
- We can't get rid of it.
- Right.

30:41.721 --> 30:45.067
Well, then that would...
perhaps social services.

30:45.456 --> 30:48.872
Who are you?
You don't know me.

30:51.411 --> 30:53.818
What do you know about
bringing children up?

30:53.819 --> 30:57.647
I've given everxthing to you, all my life.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.618
And now you want to tell ma what to do?

31:00.467 --> 31:01.957
You have no respect.

31:01.958 --> 31:05.079
If you're father was here,
he would beat you.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.876
My father is dead and
he is no use to us!

31:13.169 --> 31:16.151
- Is he all right?
- No he's not, nothing's all right.

31:16.152 --> 31:18.121
- Sorry.
- So am I.

31:27.374 --> 31:30.354
Thomas, hang on please.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.971
- What's the matter?
- I can't stand this place.

31:35.972 --> 31:37.736
- This country, no one understands.
- It's all right.

31:37.737 --> 31:39.433
No, nothing makes sense. I can't...

31:39.434 --> 31:40.785
I just can't...

32:16.603 --> 32:18.919
I can't do it. I can't.

33:10.811 --> 33:12.255
It's all right.

33:13.081 --> 33:14.983
It's all right, Thomas.

33:16.749 --> 33:18.170
It's all right.

33:44.242 --> 33:49.079
Something said to me, we need to cheer up,
what we need is a Reese-a-thon.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.684
Oh, and I brought JJ.

33:51.279 --> 33:55.130
What I like about Reese is,
she is a virgin you can belief in.

34:00.953 --> 34:03.543
- What's this one called again?
- Red neck bride.

34:04.154 --> 34:05.736
I feel that was "The Last One".

34:05.737 --> 34:07.439
No, that was "That Damn Man".

34:07.440 --> 34:10.277
Got it, she is ????

34:10.297 --> 34:12.005
No, that's Kentucky Bride Hitchin'.

34:19.589 --> 34:21.721
Go on, get one.
Go on.

34:22.838 --> 34:23.683
I don't want.

34:24.254 --> 34:26.029
- I got your favourites.
- I'm nit hungry.

34:26.516 --> 34:28.545
What's wrong?
Don't you like the film?

34:29.879 --> 34:31.014
I doesn't make sense.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.507
Whaat do you mean?

34:33.422 --> 34:36.567
Now you don't understand, why Reese
goes back to Matthew McConaughey

34:36.568 --> 34:38.105
after he slept with Rachel McAdams.

34:38.762 --> 34:40.429
No, I gotta say, you make a fair point.

34:40.429 --> 34:41.498
No, I don't mean that.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.846
Yes, but Reese forgave him,
he made a mistake.

34:43.847 --> 34:45.760
That's what I love about her,
when you make a mistake...

34:45.761 --> 34:46.828
I slept with someone.

34:47.391 --> 34:50.724
Go on, she hid the ring in her bra, you tit!

34:50.725 --> 34:52.828
You gonna use the metal detector again.

34:54.324 --> 34:55.409
Idiot.

34:55.864 --> 34:56.789
What?

34:57.684 --> 34:59.753
I slept with someone, it wasn't you.

34:59.754 --> 35:01.572
Na, na, na, thats not it.

35:01.573 --> 35:03.861
She is going make him think,
she put the horse down...

35:04.389 --> 35:06.810
and then she's gonna sleep with him,
'cause she thinks they're still married.

35:09.318 --> 35:11.431
You did it first.

35:15.710 --> 35:17.764
- You did what?
- I did it!

35:17.765 --> 35:20.449
I did it, okay?
I wanted to.

35:23.442 --> 35:25.379
You fucked it, Thommo.

36:46.098 --> 36:50.294
Ah, Thomas, would mind come in?

36:53.771 --> 36:56.926
Involvment in the girl's death,

36:56.927 --> 36:59.346
brings your collage into disrepute,

36:59.347 --> 37:04.193
and that's the reason I am going to expel you.

37:06.117 --> 37:07.601
Vodka.

37:35.693 --> 37:37.384
Another.

37:57.452 --> 37:59.194
Hey, it's Thommo.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.991
How the fuck are you still deadly married,
jamming cheating todger?

38:02.992 --> 38:04.916
What did you say?

38:04.917 --> 38:07.715
- Everyone knows, mate.
- Your such a tit, Thomas.

38:07.716 --> 38:09.748
- She loved you.
- Yup.

38:09.749 --> 38:11.479
Pissed on our Panda Pop, didn't you?

38:12.246 --> 38:15.077
Who's the lucky lady anyway,
to got Kongo-cocked?

38:15.605 --> 38:19.757
This is for selling Drugs
in my club, you bastard.

38:19.963 --> 38:21.988
- Now the girl is dead.
- Thomas.

38:21.989 --> 38:24.731
She is dead you cunt.
You fucking killed her.

38:25.793 --> 38:28.654
Break it up, you should stop it.

38:28.655 --> 38:30.370
- Stop.
- Stop.

38:30.371 --> 38:32.014
Dead, dead girl.

38:32.615 --> 38:34.479
Thomas stop.

38:34.948 --> 38:36.621
Come on, then you fucking...

38:36.870 --> 38:41.066
Thomas, Thomas. It was me,
I gave it to her.

38:41.844 --> 38:44.191
What?
You what?

38:45.957 --> 38:49.514
Cook, Cook dealt me the powder, that was it.

38:50.365 --> 38:54.576
I needed the money, and
I just sold it to some random.

38:55.412 --> 38:57.290
She died.
She is dead!

38:57.291 --> 38:58.625
I didn't mean that.

38:59.945 --> 39:01.853
Please don't tell anyone.

39:02.528 --> 39:04.230
Do not tell Emily.

39:05.418 --> 39:07.003
She would...

39:47.010 --> 39:48.081
Thomas.

39:48.961 --> 39:52.057
Good evening Papa Babaj... Babaj ...

39:52.058 --> 39:52.864
You're drunk.

39:53.128 --> 39:54.214
No, no...

39:54.844 --> 40:00.097
I was wondering, if maybe
I could pissibly see Andrea.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.822
I feel sorry for you, Thomas.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.574
No, no. I need to talk to...

40:10.575 --> 40:15.286
Andrea!

40:15.287 --> 40:16.992
I need to talk to you.

40:24.346 --> 40:27.445
Thomas!

40:32.870 --> 40:34.961
I need to speak to someone.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.858
So tell me what you did that's so terrible.

40:45.862 --> 40:47.627
I betrayed someone, I love.

40:48.498 --> 40:50.057
With you.

40:57.324 --> 40:58.745
I see.

41:03.551 --> 41:05.271
You feel so right.

41:06.371 --> 41:10.452
Everything about you ... is like home.

41:11.919 --> 41:14.303
- But...
- It doesn't work like that.

41:17.192 --> 41:18.980
You lover her.

41:30.594 --> 41:33.047
Good bye, Thomas.

41:53.055 --> 41:55.623
I don't know, why we came here.

41:57.296 --> 41:59.497
For a better life.

42:01.790 --> 42:04.151
I can change things.

42:40.313 --> 42:42.949
You will love this place.

42:48.978 --> 42:52.234
Make your deposit now
and it'll be yours today.

43:12.946 --> 43:14.047
Can I come in?

43:14.048 --> 43:16.247
No, you fucker.

43:18.104 --> 43:22.758
Pandora, ???, can we do it now.

43:25.336 --> 43:26.847
I don't think so.

43:35.196 --> 43:36.634
But I love you Panda.

43:39.427 --> 43:41.246
I know you do, Thomas.

44:06.420 --> 44:08.841
I told him that like you said.

44:15.956 --> 44:17.086
Good.

44:19.043 --> 44:20.319
Eat up.

44:23.444 --> 44:27.240
Well done, he needs to think about what he did.

44:30.287 --> 44:32.854
I'm glad you're back, Eff.
