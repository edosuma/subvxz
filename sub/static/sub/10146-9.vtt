WEBVTT

00:03.585 --> 00:06.465
They put their lives on the line
time and time again, Charles.

00:06.497 --> 00:08.697
You speak or he dies.

00:08.996 --> 00:11.836
We were ordered to covertly go
into North Korea

00:12.141 --> 00:15.021
with the intention of committing
terrorist attacks.

00:21.381 --> 00:24.821
There are whispers about a
high-level attack in Europe.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.941
I made some progress on the names
we've got.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.941
They're Office 39 sleeper agents.

00:29.101 --> 00:32.941
If they put the pieces together,
we have Li-Na, we have Oppenheimer.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.181
Li-Na is headed to Geneva with
a nuclear bomb,

00:36.301 --> 00:38.141
straight to the United Nations.

00:38.301 --> 00:41.461
You were the one I crossed
the line for. You're a good man.

00:41.621 --> 00:43.901
You killed my son.

00:46.381 --> 00:50.781
'My country has been involved in a
war for as long as I can remember.

00:50.941 --> 00:54.901
'It is not a war of guns and tanks,
of bullets and bombs,

00:55.061 --> 00:58.781
'but an economic assault on every
level of our society.

00:58.941 --> 01:01.981
'Every fiscal sanction
available has been levelled upon us,

01:02.141 --> 01:05.061
'hoping to bring about
financial collapse.

01:05.221 --> 01:07.581
'What are the consequences
of all this?

01:09.101 --> 01:12.741
'The reality is a country broken
and bent by an outside world.

01:13.861 --> 01:16.221
'A country told to bow before
the West,

01:16.341 --> 01:18.701
'or face further punishment.

01:18.861 --> 01:23.061
'The West spends billions
on upgrading its nuclear arsenal.

01:24.421 --> 01:26.981
'They arm the world

01:27.141 --> 01:30.541
'but they deny us the ability to
defend ourselves.'

01:30.661 --> 01:34.021
We have begged, we have bowed

01:34.141 --> 01:37.341
and we say, "No more."

01:37.461 --> 01:39.541
And so today everything changes.

01:39.701 --> 01:43.261
Today, we bring the true
horror of nuclear capability

01:43.421 --> 01:48.421
that your nations cherish so
much to the heart of the UN itself.

01:50.581 --> 01:51.701
Move.

01:58.261 --> 01:59.901
Move!

02:01.581 --> 02:03.301
Where is the other one?

02:03.461 --> 02:07.221
The other one is dead.
Michael, I am sorry.

02:07.341 --> 02:09.221
Move forward!

02:12.781 --> 02:15.177
Down on your knees. Now!

02:56.541 --> 02:57.941
You're not listening to me.

02:58.101 --> 03:00.421
She's taken a nuclear device
and she is headed for Geneva.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.141
That's not possible. Charles,
you have to trust me on this one.

03:03.301 --> 03:06.981
We have intel that places her
in Paris not more than an hour ago.

03:10.661 --> 03:13.061
Yeah, well, she's feeding you that.
It's a false trail.

03:13.181 --> 03:15.061
The matter is in hand.

03:15.221 --> 03:17.421
You have to let this obsession
go, Philip.

03:17.581 --> 03:20.421
Besides,
it's not your concern any more.

03:30.981 --> 03:33.421
We're finished.
Fuck, you're kidding me?

03:33.581 --> 03:36.581
No, we've been ordered to stand down
and return to London.

03:38.061 --> 03:40.901
As of now,
Section 20 is officially disbanded.

03:41.061 --> 03:43.181
That's bullshit.
Ah, so what?

03:43.301 --> 03:44.941
I'm finished.

03:45.061 --> 03:46.501
With this, all of it.

03:46.621 --> 03:48.341
So, what about Li-Na? Huh?

03:48.501 --> 03:50.741
Well, intel has her in Paris.
Oh, come on, boss.

03:50.901 --> 03:54.621
Do you believe that? Michael, it's
called the chain of command.

03:54.781 --> 03:58.141
You obey the person above you
without question. You believe that?

03:58.261 --> 04:00.021
No, I don't.

04:00.181 --> 04:03.461
Good. So we're going to Geneva.
You're suggesting what?

04:04.861 --> 04:09.701
We disobey a direct order, one
that's come from the top? Exactly.

04:09.861 --> 04:12.181
Michael? I'm always up for a bit
of insubordination, boss.

04:14.941 --> 04:16.541
One last job, let's move.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.901
The UN's hosting a nuclear
disarmament conference

04:24.021 --> 04:25.421
in the main council chamber.

04:25.541 --> 04:27.581
That's got to be Li-Na's target.

04:27.741 --> 04:30.981
A gathering of North Korea's
sworn enemies.

04:31.101 --> 04:34.061
The uranium converted from around

04:34.221 --> 04:38.621
20,000 dismantled Russian
nuclear warheads,

04:38.781 --> 04:41.541
were shipped to reactors in
the States.

04:41.701 --> 04:46.141
Those same reactors power 10% of
all American electricity.

04:46.261 --> 04:47.581
All right.

04:47.741 --> 04:51.341
'You're going in as tourists so try
and act naturally.

04:51.501 --> 04:53.901
'It's not going to be
a walk in the park.

04:54.061 --> 04:58.061
'Whitehall will be very quick to
deny us if this goes wrong.'

04:58.181 --> 05:00.701
I feel naked without my gun.

05:00.821 --> 05:03.101
Is that weird? No.

05:05.421 --> 05:09.341
Fluidium by Kinga Azur. Huh.

05:09.501 --> 05:12.061
That's a classic
example of abstract expressionism.

05:13.861 --> 05:17.901
Michael? Hmm? I don't give a fuck.

05:18.021 --> 05:19.821
Philistine.

05:19.941 --> 05:21.901
Get hold of a security card.

05:22.061 --> 05:25.341
She's taking a bomb into one of the
most secure buildings in the world.

05:25.501 --> 05:29.701
'If she can find a way in, so can
we. The whole city is at risk.

05:29.821 --> 05:32.461
'We've got to act fast.'

05:32.621 --> 05:36.421
Sorry. It's fine.
I was just admiring the sculpture.

05:36.581 --> 05:39.901
A classic example of
abstract expressionism.

05:40.061 --> 05:43.341
You know your culture.
I dabble a bit.

05:45.181 --> 05:47.181
Par ici, s'il vous plait.

05:47.301 --> 05:49.261
My name's Damien Scott and I dabble.

05:49.421 --> 05:52.661
A simple rule in life, Mike,
you've either got it or you don't.

05:52.781 --> 05:54.541
Do you have it?

05:54.661 --> 05:56.781
I've got it.

05:56.901 --> 05:59.221
Zero, we're moving in.

05:59.381 --> 06:02.461
After your arrest in Vienna,
you're in the system.

06:02.621 --> 06:07.061
'There are security personnel
and cameras everywhere. Heads down.'

06:07.181 --> 06:09.141
Cup of tea, please. OK.

06:13.901 --> 06:16.181
Wait.

06:16.341 --> 06:19.941
Those two. Watch their walk.
Those two there?

06:21.421 --> 06:24.501
Look where they're heading.

06:49.141 --> 06:52.741
Got them! Alert the patrol,
area three.

06:52.901 --> 06:55.981
'Proceeding to service area three,
activate lockdown.'

07:01.701 --> 07:03.461
Hands up where we can see them.

07:03.621 --> 07:07.621
We were just on tour and
we got lost, really. Hands!

07:07.741 --> 07:08.821
Let's go.

07:16.461 --> 07:20.141
I am British military intelligence.
Not according to our records.

07:20.301 --> 07:25.261
We state you are wanted in connection
with a bank robbery in Vienna.

07:27.221 --> 07:30.421
There is a woman, her name is
Han Li-Na.

07:30.581 --> 07:34.021
She is North Korean
and associated with Office 39.

07:34.181 --> 07:36.221
She will be here under
an assumed name.

07:38.061 --> 07:40.101
Call it in. Just call it in.

07:40.261 --> 07:43.741
This is not some fantasy,
something that may or may not happen.

07:43.901 --> 07:46.221
There is a nuclear threat to this
building, to this city.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.261
This is happening.

07:48.381 --> 07:50.261
This is real.

07:50.421 --> 07:53.541
This means that one in ten light
bulbs in the States

07:53.701 --> 07:57.781
is lit by former Soviet
weapon material.

07:57.901 --> 08:00.661
Now the disarmament...

08:03.381 --> 08:06.581
Maybe we could use some of those
light bulbs here right now.

08:08.661 --> 08:10.741
Just do your job and call it...

08:10.861 --> 08:13.261
This is what I'm talking about.

08:13.421 --> 08:17.261
This is it. This right here is what
I'm talking about.

08:17.381 --> 08:19.781
You stay here. For God's sake!

08:25.101 --> 08:28.541
And I'm sure that normal services
will be resumed as soon as possible.

08:46.061 --> 08:48.061
Go, go!

08:48.181 --> 08:51.021
Go, go. Come on, go!

08:54.861 --> 08:58.021
Everybody move away from the
building. This is not a drill.

08:58.141 --> 08:59.541
Bravo one and two, come in.

09:37.861 --> 09:38.981
Move!

09:41.581 --> 09:42.741
Be quiet!

10:10.021 --> 10:11.621
Hey, bud.

10:11.741 --> 10:14.341
Here, can get rid of these?

10:20.021 --> 10:23.301
Thank you. Going right. Yep.

10:47.221 --> 10:52.181
Ladies and gentleman,
please forgive the interruption

10:52.341 --> 10:55.901
but I believe the time
for talk is over.

10:59.021 --> 11:00.261
Go.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.261
Go.

11:04.381 --> 11:06.461
Stay. Go.

11:08.261 --> 11:09.741
Go.

11:09.861 --> 11:12.461
Stay. Go. Go!

11:14.941 --> 11:16.101
You.

11:18.421 --> 11:20.101
You are definitely staying.

12:10.333 --> 12:15.533
Once the device is primed, it's a
ten-minute countdown to detonation.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.973
We need to be out in six, if we're to
make the helicopter in time.

12:22.573 --> 12:25.493
What if we don't?

12:25.613 --> 12:28.933
We stand side by side

12:29.053 --> 12:32.053
knowing that either way, what we do,

12:32.213 --> 12:36.293
will wake our nation
from its slumber.

13:15.733 --> 13:18.413
We're here, council's here.

13:18.533 --> 13:20.653
It's that way. After you.

13:36.413 --> 13:39.653
Section 20, to be precise.

13:39.773 --> 13:42.373
Your team took down Leo Kamali?

13:42.533 --> 13:46.213
And the same two men who did that,
are inside the building right now.

13:48.613 --> 13:52.933
Might be the first piece of good news
I've had all day. Please.

13:58.413 --> 14:02.693
So you need to send your men in.
The building is in lockdown.

14:02.853 --> 14:05.573
Reinforced doors, bombproof windows,
no in or out.

14:05.773 --> 14:09.813
Emergency protocol... Yeah, it
dictates that if Li-Na takes
hostages, we don't encroach.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.613
Exactement. Yeah, I know that.

14:11.898 --> 14:13.578
And she knows that.

14:13.698 --> 14:15.738
Don't you understand?

14:15.858 --> 14:18.098
That's how she's keeping you at bay.

14:18.218 --> 14:20.098
I cannot go against direct orders.

14:22.018 --> 14:24.258
She's got a nuclear device,
for Christ's sake.

14:24.378 --> 14:26.978
This is not confirmed.

14:27.138 --> 14:30.378
You're a soldier in the field
and all that matters right now,

14:30.498 --> 14:32.298
is your judgment call.

14:50.378 --> 14:52.418
Oh, shit!

14:54.258 --> 14:57.858
Mikey, got some on three.
Stairs, go, go.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.818
Fuck you.

15:23.378 --> 15:27.098
Sorry about that,
we're the good guys.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.698
Come with me.

15:41.778 --> 15:44.298
There were a lot of feeds to monitor.

15:44.418 --> 15:46.218
They must have slipped through.

15:49.138 --> 15:52.658
You're releasing
all of the doors in the area.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.658
These men, they need to believe
they're in control

15:55.778 --> 15:58.538
of their own destiny,

15:58.658 --> 16:01.458
unaware of who really guides them.

16:02.858 --> 16:05.058
Take over.

16:07.098 --> 16:09.978
Lock them in zone B

16:10.138 --> 16:12.098
until they have nowhere left
to hide.

16:17.658 --> 16:20.218
I know him, I know him!

16:20.338 --> 16:22.818
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

16:22.978 --> 16:25.698
We need to find a way above the
council chamber, a lighting gantry,

16:25.858 --> 16:27.898
an access point, stairs.
Can you think of anything?

16:28.058 --> 16:32.538
There's stairs this way, takes you
to the fourth floor. Right.

16:32.698 --> 16:35.258
Mikey, give me the card.
Yeah, show us.

16:35.418 --> 16:38.898
Hand here, on my shoulder, stay
with me.

16:55.218 --> 16:57.618
Follow him.

17:01.138 --> 17:02.458
Come on!

17:15.178 --> 17:17.258
Shit!

17:17.377 --> 17:19.258
There's another way, here.

17:24.657 --> 17:27.298
Are we trapped?
Well, trapped is a strong word.

17:27.417 --> 17:29.018
Ears, ears, ears.

17:31.178 --> 17:33.458
Yeah, we're trapped.

17:37.578 --> 17:41.538
What's wrong with these things?
Scott. Yeah?

17:41.698 --> 17:43.858
It's the cameras. There's cameras
all over the place.

17:44.018 --> 17:45.698
What,
you think they're locking us in?

17:48.618 --> 17:51.298
Yeah, I do. I think it's a kill box.

17:56.338 --> 17:57.778
Give me that key.

17:57.898 --> 17:59.378
Let's knock these cameras off.

18:02.018 --> 18:04.418
Shit. What is it?

18:04.538 --> 18:06.258
Got it.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.338
We can switch the cameras off.

18:08.498 --> 18:11.138
Which wire?
I don't know, all of them.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.338
There you go.

18:21.098 --> 18:22.418
Open the door.

18:24.218 --> 18:25.658
I've found our door.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.178
Help!

18:33.058 --> 18:34.698
Here we go.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.898
All clear.

18:39.058 --> 18:43.258
Right on his heels, go. Shit, we've
got bogies coming in, Scott.

18:44.378 --> 18:46.338
Open the door!

18:48.258 --> 18:50.858
You've got to open the door! Now!

19:05.258 --> 19:07.618
'They have evaded capture.'

19:07.778 --> 19:11.018
And they will try
and find a way here to stop us.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.378
So we wait no longer.

19:15.498 --> 19:17.498
Come back now.

19:20.898 --> 19:24.018
We're just rats in her maze.
You've got to hand it to her.

19:24.178 --> 19:26.458
I'd like to hand her
a bullet to the head.

19:29.818 --> 19:31.698
If they still control the doors,

19:31.858 --> 19:34.378
there's no way we'll get to the
chamber in time.

19:35.538 --> 19:37.178
Maybe.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.698
Those lifts should be powered down.

19:55.618 --> 19:59.978
We don't need any power, Mikey.
Huh, that's a good idea. Got it?

20:02.276 --> 20:03.876
All right, here.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.297
You take that, find somewhere safe to
hide and it'll all be over soon.

20:06.335 --> 20:09.375
I have a son. It is his birthday
this weekend.

20:09.535 --> 20:12.295
While you've been in this
sort of situation before...

20:12.320 --> 20:14.920
Yeah, once or twice... Then
I stand a better chance of surviving

20:15.040 --> 20:16.720
if I go with you.

20:16.881 --> 20:19.481
We're not running away from trouble.
You see that?

20:19.641 --> 20:23.521
Right now we're looking for trouble.
What about them? Shot in the back.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.521
They were running from trouble
and look where it got them.

20:26.641 --> 20:29.241
You want to come, take that gun.

20:31.401 --> 20:34.921
All right. As easy as one, two,
three. Just don't look down.

20:44.841 --> 20:46.721
You're doing really well.
Just don't look down.

21:00.401 --> 21:04.161
Mike. Yeah? Did you say the elevators
were off?

21:04.281 --> 21:06.761
They're supposed to be off.

21:06.881 --> 21:09.441
It's not because here it comes.

21:14.241 --> 21:16.881
When the time is right, just
step off. What?

21:17.001 --> 21:19.521
Step on the elevator, quietly.

21:19.641 --> 21:21.321
So, go on three.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.241
So three, two, one,
step on it at four.

21:24.401 --> 21:27.921
That's three beats and then we'll
go... Three, two, one, go.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.721
Yeah, it's kind of common sense,
isn't it? It's fucking bullshit.

21:30.841 --> 21:32.881
So when should I go? Now!

22:31.081 --> 22:33.561
Get off now, quick.

22:33.721 --> 22:36.281
Come here, give me your hand.
Get up.

22:38.561 --> 22:41.041
Give me your hand.
Come here.

22:43.161 --> 22:44.681
Are you all right?

22:44.801 --> 22:47.081
Good.

22:47.241 --> 22:50.121
See, I told you
we were looking for trouble.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.281
We have no time to lose.

23:03.401 --> 23:04.801
Let's begin.

23:06.721 --> 23:08.881
Ma'am... Stay down!
It's all right.

23:10.961 --> 23:15.001
My name's John Turner and I am the
US representative...

23:15.121 --> 23:16.681
I know who you are.

23:16.841 --> 23:19.921
"The international community has
condemned North Korea's

23:20.081 --> 23:24.841
"continued efforts to advance
its missile and nuclear programmes."

23:24.961 --> 23:26.881
Does that sound familiar?

23:27.041 --> 23:31.881
Yeah, referring to the Security
Council Resolution 2094.

23:32.001 --> 23:34.321
Which you co-authored.

23:34.481 --> 23:38.161
We offered you aid.
And then you took it away.

23:38.321 --> 23:41.521
To stop the proliferation of
nuclear weapons, ma'am.

23:41.681 --> 23:45.641
I believe in peaceful resolution,
that we can work together.

23:45.761 --> 23:49.001
No, you interrupted me, Mr Turner.

23:49.161 --> 23:53.001
You only believe in doing what's
best for yourself.

23:53.121 --> 23:55.041
You are American.

23:55.161 --> 23:57.241
I will not be interrupted again.

23:59.921 --> 24:02.081
On the bomb we'll set the timer.

24:02.241 --> 24:06.281
Turn on the cameras and let
the world see our final stand.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.521
You, come here!

24:12.201 --> 24:13.601
Camera.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.041
Centre stage.

24:32.104 --> 24:36.384
'My country has been involved in a
war for as long as I can remember.'

24:36.544 --> 24:39.484
It looks like our cue to
hurry the fuck up.

24:39.533 --> 24:42.693
You go for the chamber
and I'll open the doors.

24:42.813 --> 24:44.373
Come on.

24:44.494 --> 24:47.214
No! I'm sorry.

24:47.334 --> 24:49.014
I can't let you do that.

24:50.652 --> 24:54.572
You want to think about what you're
doing. What I was trained to do.

24:54.692 --> 24:56.812
What I have been waiting years for.

24:56.972 --> 25:00.612
Have you any idea what she's
planning? Hmm? A nuclear bomb.

25:00.731 --> 25:02.971
Here, in this building right now.

25:03.131 --> 25:05.771
Just think for one second the
destruction she's going to cause.

25:05.891 --> 25:07.931
Put, put your weapons down.

25:08.051 --> 25:10.611
Your own country disavowed her.

25:10.731 --> 25:12.811
This isn't about the regime.

25:12.931 --> 25:14.251
She's acting alone.

25:21.611 --> 25:23.691
Scott.

25:23.851 --> 25:26.931
It's all right. How long have you
been stationed here

25:27.051 --> 25:28.211
working for North Korea?

25:28.331 --> 25:29.811
Nine years.

25:29.931 --> 25:31.731
That's a long time.

25:34.291 --> 25:38.251
Your kid, was that part of the plan?

25:42.131 --> 25:43.491
I get it.

25:44.771 --> 25:46.571
The real world changes things.

25:48.731 --> 25:53.611
Maybe the life they planned for you
isn't the life you ended up with.

25:54.078 --> 25:55.158
Weapons down!

25:55.237 --> 25:56.257
Hey.

25:57.558 --> 25:59.238
Keep that there.

26:04.958 --> 26:07.478
You could have shot us.

26:07.598 --> 26:09.238
You had plenty of chances...

26:11.118 --> 26:12.478
..but you didn't.

26:14.718 --> 26:17.198
I'm guessing you were hoping it
would never come to this.

26:17.318 --> 26:18.558
But it has.

26:21.118 --> 26:25.718
So now you've got to make a choice.

26:25.878 --> 26:28.078
What matters to you most,
your child...

26:30.638 --> 26:32.078
..or your job?

26:38.918 --> 26:44.278
We have begged,
we have bowed and we say no more.

26:45.878 --> 26:48.238
And so today everything changes.

26:48.398 --> 26:52.398
'Today we bring the true horror of
nuclear capability to

26:52.518 --> 26:54.838
'the heart of the UN itself.'

26:56.398 --> 27:00.758
You were correct. I should have sent
my men in earlier.

27:00.878 --> 27:02.398
You made a call.

27:02.517 --> 27:04.557
Right or wrong, it's what we do.

27:04.717 --> 27:07.677
Now you make another one
and pray it's not too late.

27:24.158 --> 27:25.518
Stop!

27:32.598 --> 27:33.998
Move forward.

27:35.518 --> 27:37.838
Where is the other one?
The other one is dead.

27:39.798 --> 27:41.878
Michael, I am sorry.

27:42.038 --> 27:44.838
I'm impressed that you've made it
this far.

27:46.158 --> 27:48.518
I'm not interested in your approval.

27:49.638 --> 27:50.958
Move forward!

27:51.118 --> 27:54.278
Down on your knees. Now!
Fair enough.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.398
Hey, it's been a good
day at the office.

28:59.518 --> 29:01.358
Now go and buy your kid an ice cream.

29:01.478 --> 29:04.278
Everybody out, please.

29:04.398 --> 29:06.598
Come on, let's go.

29:06.718 --> 29:07.798
Get them out.

29:09.718 --> 29:11.718
Come on, please.

29:14.918 --> 29:17.918
What's the deactivation code?

29:20.038 --> 29:26.598
These are moments, Michael, moments
that change the course of history.

29:26.718 --> 29:28.278
That's not what I asked.

29:32.278 --> 29:34.078
Scott, what have you got?

29:34.198 --> 29:35.878
I've got five minutes ten.

29:35.998 --> 29:38.118
Mike, five minutes seven.

29:38.238 --> 29:40.598
OK, let's go. Hurry up.

29:40.718 --> 29:42.558
Allez, allez, allez.

29:44.878 --> 29:46.518
Allez, allez.

29:48.238 --> 29:53.398
Li-Na, there are at least nine more
reasons in here why you are going to

29:53.558 --> 29:56.358
tell me what the
deactivation code is.

29:59.438 --> 30:01.478
Eight more reasons. The code now.

30:10.197 --> 30:11.597
Three...

30:13.478 --> 30:15.558
Three, seven, four, one.

30:17.038 --> 30:19.238
Three, seven, four, one.

30:26.317 --> 30:27.797
Yeah? Yeah.

30:27.918 --> 30:30.398
Wait, no.

30:30.518 --> 30:33.158
Mikey, one minute 57. What?

30:33.278 --> 30:34.958
55, 54. It's not the fucking code.

30:35.118 --> 30:36.958
The real code. Give me the
real code!

30:39.838 --> 30:41.678
Li-Na, look at me.

30:44.878 --> 30:47.078
It makes no difference.

30:47.198 --> 30:49.598
We were always willing to die.

30:49.718 --> 30:51.278
But not like this.

30:52.558 --> 30:54.598
Nobody is supposed to die like this.

30:56.398 --> 30:58.238
Shit.

31:03.118 --> 31:06.838
Shit. Scott, I'm running
out of options here. Yeah, so am I.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.558
I've never worked
on anything like this.

31:09.678 --> 31:10.918
Fuck.

31:12.478 --> 31:14.958
What are you doing?
I'm calling a friend.

31:15.118 --> 31:16.838
What do you mean you're
calling a friend?

31:16.998 --> 31:18.718
This isn't
Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

31:18.838 --> 31:21.158
No, it's Who Wants To Survive?

31:31.758 --> 31:34.358
Mitchell. 'Yeah?' It's Damien Scott.

31:34.478 --> 31:36.518
Hey, hey! Blast from the past, man.

31:36.718 --> 31:40.318
Where've you been? I've got
a miniature, improvised nuke,
all right?

31:40.438 --> 31:42.078
Three wires.

31:42.198 --> 31:43.718
Heading down from C4 to power.

31:45.078 --> 31:48.558
We've got blue, brown, red wire.

31:48.718 --> 31:50.678
Which one do I cut? What?

31:50.838 --> 31:53.838
I've got a miniature improvised nuke.
Three wires, all right?

31:53.958 --> 31:55.638
Blue, brown, red.

31:55.798 --> 32:00.478
Come on, which do I cut?
The timer's 59 seconds, Mitchell.

32:00.638 --> 32:04.158
Is this a joke?
It's not a fucking joke, all right?

32:05.878 --> 32:08.878
Ah. Oh, OK, hang on.

32:09.038 --> 32:12.278
OK, tell me exactly what it
looks like.

32:12.438 --> 32:15.038
It looks like the fucking
Death Star with a shitload of wires.

32:15.158 --> 32:16.838
I've never seen anything like it.

32:19.158 --> 32:22.958
You've got explosive lenses,

32:23.078 --> 32:25.678
tamper, reflector, three wires.

32:25.838 --> 32:29.918
One red, east, going into
the junction box power.

32:30.078 --> 32:34.078
Blue, west, going from the C4
back to firing circuits.

32:34.198 --> 32:36.238
Brown, dead centre.

32:36.398 --> 32:38.478
Is there anything else?
Anything else?!

32:38.598 --> 32:40.198
You've now got 35 seconds.

32:40.358 --> 32:43.478
Can you change the goddamn baby and
talk to your buddies later? Not now.

32:43.638 --> 32:47.318
She's going to get a rash.
I said, not fucking now.

32:47.478 --> 32:51.158
OK, it's not the brown one, it's
the dummy. So, ah...

32:51.278 --> 32:53.078
Mitchell, I'm serious.

32:53.198 --> 32:55.798
It's not brown. 27 seconds. Blue.

32:55.918 --> 32:57.838
Blue? Sure? No, I'm not.

32:57.998 --> 33:00.918
Why the hell do you think I left
the agency? Because I wasn't sure.

33:01.038 --> 33:02.278
Are you serious?

33:02.438 --> 33:06.318
Because there's a wire, there's a
timer, there's a fucking bomb.

33:06.438 --> 33:07.678
Oh, shhh...

33:07.798 --> 33:09.998
No, wait, it's red. Red?

33:10.118 --> 33:11.838
It's red 100%, Damien.

33:13.038 --> 33:15.158
He's 100% on red, Mikey.

33:15.318 --> 33:18.518
He was a freak explosives
expert back in the day.

33:18.678 --> 33:23.198
Damien, he said red. He completely
lost his nerve, total breakdown.

33:23.318 --> 33:24.958
I can still hear it in his voice.

33:25.118 --> 33:27.638
If he's backing red,
I'm backing the fuck out of blue.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.318
That's a hell of a judgment
call to make. I know.

33:30.438 --> 33:31.958
Nice knowing you, Mikey.

33:42.398 --> 33:43.878
That son of a bitch.

33:45.158 --> 33:49.758
'Damien, are you there? Damien!'

33:49.878 --> 33:51.878
Yeah, it was blue.

33:51.998 --> 33:54.918
I said blue. You said red. Fuck you.

33:55.038 --> 33:57.598
Say hi to Sadie and the kid for me.

33:57.718 --> 33:59.038
You owe me a beer.

34:02.918 --> 34:05.558
We have to go. Let me say goodbye.

34:07.398 --> 34:09.197
You just did.

34:09.318 --> 34:10.558
Come on.

34:14.118 --> 34:16.478
Come on, come here. Don't move!

34:16.598 --> 34:18.518
Weapons down. Weapons down!

34:19.958 --> 34:21.838
Come here.

34:21.958 --> 34:23.478
Weapons down!

34:23.638 --> 34:27.358
Fuck you. That's very diplomatic,
mate. I'm so sorry, Mike.

34:27.518 --> 34:30.438
We're neutral. I don't give a shit
what he's got to say.

34:30.558 --> 34:32.398
Our orders are clear.

34:32.558 --> 34:36.158
Either you hand the prisoner over or
you have to be treated as hostile.

34:40.072 --> 34:42.513
What the hell are you playing at?

34:42.536 --> 34:45.016
We checked with Whitehall,
your men were told to stand down.

34:45.176 --> 34:47.456
She is our prisoner
and we are taking her out.

34:47.576 --> 34:49.016
These orders come from above me.

34:50.416 --> 34:53.616
Fine. I'm going for my men.
I cannot allow that.

34:57.416 --> 34:59.976
You'll have to shoot me in the back.

35:00.136 --> 35:02.656
Don't worry, you're only following
orders.

35:02.776 --> 35:04.016
Arret! Arret!

35:08.376 --> 35:10.296
What do you want to do, Mikey?

35:10.456 --> 35:13.776
To tell you the truth, I'd rather
not get into it with them.

35:13.896 --> 35:16.176
We hand her over, it's game over.

35:16.336 --> 35:19.216
Take her in ourselves
and they'll roll out the red carpet.

35:19.376 --> 35:21.896
Since when has that ever
mattered to you?

35:22.056 --> 35:27.016
It doesn't. It matters to you,
though. It's your life, Mikey.

35:27.176 --> 35:30.576
I'm willing to screw up a lot of
things, but not that.

35:30.736 --> 35:32.536
Well, cheers, mate.
I'm touched. Weapons down!

35:41.736 --> 35:43.376
Get in!

36:25.536 --> 36:27.256
Les anglais.

36:42.376 --> 36:45.656
What did she say, Julia?

36:49.416 --> 36:53.296
Her final words, what were they?

36:55.376 --> 36:57.696
She said that you would come for me.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.656
There would be nowhere I could hide.

37:01.416 --> 37:02.816
She didn't deserve to die.

37:04.936 --> 37:06.936
No, she didn't.

37:09.656 --> 37:11.056
Walk.

37:12.696 --> 37:16.816
Charles, it's Philip Locke.
'I've been trying to reach you.'

37:16.976 --> 37:19.976
Well, I've been a bit busy.
Yes, so I've heard.

37:20.096 --> 37:23.176
You have Li-Na now? 'We do.

37:23.336 --> 37:26.376
'Looks like Geneva was the
correct call.'

37:26.536 --> 37:29.056
Look, I'm fighting fires here
but I guarantee you,

37:29.216 --> 37:32.856
bring her in and I'll personally make
sure that Section 20 is reinstated.

37:33.016 --> 37:35.536
Whitehall will have no choice,
believe me.

37:35.696 --> 37:37.936
Give me a minute
and I'll send you the coordinates.

37:38.056 --> 37:42.496
Oh, and Philip, I was wrong

37:42.616 --> 37:44.496
and I'm glad you were right.

38:18.576 --> 38:21.616
You risk your lives time
and time again.

38:23.296 --> 38:25.256
You give everything.

38:25.416 --> 38:27.896
Yet, men who exist only
behind desks,

38:28.016 --> 38:30.136
who will never know combat,

38:30.296 --> 38:34.016
who will never understand
the judgment calls you have to make,

38:34.136 --> 38:35.616
you follow their command.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.016
We're soldiers.

38:40.216 --> 38:43.576
No, you're much more than that.

39:03.576 --> 39:06.176
It's Mason and Faber, stay sharp.

39:09.296 --> 39:11.016
Come on.

39:12.656 --> 39:16.456
Get out.
Once we hand her over, I'm done.

39:16.616 --> 39:18.856
She's right, I gave everything
to my country,

39:18.976 --> 39:21.776
my world, my son, everything

39:21.896 --> 39:24.016
and I've nothing left to give.

39:24.176 --> 39:27.936
If you two want to return to active
service, go ahead

39:28.056 --> 39:29.536
but I am out.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.696
This is wrong. Shut up.

39:36.816 --> 39:38.416
You feel it too.

39:40.296 --> 39:44.376
Philip, gentlemen. What the
hell are they doing here?

39:44.536 --> 39:47.736
Whitehall have asked Stillwater
to assist us.

39:47.856 --> 39:49.656
In many ways it's easier that way.

39:49.816 --> 39:53.536
Actions by hired hands can easily be
denied by the state.

39:53.696 --> 39:57.256
Korea was a mess. You've been
talking to their government.

39:57.416 --> 40:00.656
We have to avoid retaliation. Close
to the brink of a war nobody wants.

40:00.776 --> 40:03.416
This is bullshit. Yes, it is.

40:03.576 --> 40:07.576
And I hate to see good men caught
up in it. We're not, not any more.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.336
Here's your prisoner.

40:11.016 --> 40:12.696
We're leaving.

40:12.856 --> 40:16.256
With the greatest of
respect, sir, we're out, sir.

40:16.376 --> 40:17.776
Boss.

40:17.936 --> 40:22.936
Look, I understand
and I'm sorry it's come to this.

40:23.056 --> 40:25.256
But you delivered her to us

40:25.416 --> 40:27.856
and that means more than
I could ever tell you.

40:33.336 --> 40:34.616
No!

40:37.736 --> 40:38.936
No!

40:45.376 --> 40:47.256
Going to get him!

40:51.536 --> 40:52.736
Scott!

40:54.776 --> 40:55.816
Come here.

41:03.096 --> 41:04.376
Stay there.

41:08.376 --> 41:11.376
We're flying out of here,
on that chopper.

41:12.776 --> 41:14.376
Give me your lighter.

41:16.896 --> 41:18.816
Go, go, go!

41:38.856 --> 41:40.616
Come on!

41:45.856 --> 41:47.696
Come on!

41:47.816 --> 41:49.576
Get in, get in!

41:51.496 --> 41:55.376
Do you know how to fly this thing?
Guess we're going to find out.

42:33.056 --> 42:35.856
Keep it steady, Scott.
Boss, boss, you're going to be fine.

42:36.016 --> 42:38.496
We're going to get somewhere,
you'll be fine. It's OK.

42:38.616 --> 42:40.496
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

42:40.656 --> 42:42.856
You're going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

42:42.976 --> 42:44.656
We're going to get out of this.

42:47.336 --> 42:51.136
You're going to be fine.

42:52.696 --> 42:54.376
It's OK, Michael.

42:58.496 --> 43:02.816
No, no, don't, don't...

43:08.056 --> 43:09.736
Hey.

43:20.936 --> 43:25.296
Boss, boss! Come here!

43:28.016 --> 43:30.936
Shit! Shit! Shit!

43:36.896 --> 43:38.776
We're going down, mate.

44:11.556 --> 44:37.440
