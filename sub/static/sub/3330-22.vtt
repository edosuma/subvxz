00:04.704 --> 00:06.672
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.674 --> 00:10.709
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.711 --> 00:12.745
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.747 --> 00:15.347
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.783
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:20.185
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:21.653
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.655 --> 00:23.088
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:25.024
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.026 --> 00:26.658
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.028
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.363
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.532
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:36.068
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:38.570
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.572 --> 00:40.539
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:42.075 --> 00:44.143
â™ª

00:47.347 --> 00:50.049
(engine revving)

00:53.153 --> 00:54.453
I want gallo out.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.754
Then I'll resign.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.122
Effective immediately.

01:02.295 --> 01:03.796
I just don't want him
to become you.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.669
I don't think
I can be here anymore.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.080
(crashing)

01:25.118 --> 01:28.153
Calling to order scorpion 2.0.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.155
Toby curtis?

01:30.157 --> 01:32.091
Check.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.159
Sylvester dodd?

01:34.161 --> 01:36.161
Check.

01:36.163 --> 01:39.431
And... Happy quinn?

01:39.433 --> 01:40.699
Whatever you're doing,

01:40.701 --> 01:44.136
I'm maintaining a sense
of order in our chaos,

01:44.138 --> 01:45.337
Filling a leadership vacuum.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.239
You're highly unqualified.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.208
Spend your time wisely.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.410
Look for a new gig,
like me.

01:51.412 --> 01:54.813
Now, walter did not say that
this was the end of scorpion.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.516
He only said that
he didn't need cabe or paige.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.817
However implausible that is,

01:58.819 --> 02:01.487
Maybe scorpion will...

02:01.489 --> 02:03.522
Persevere.
Happy:
Run the numbers on that.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.492
We lost a third of our personnel
in one night.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.260
We're back to where
we were a year ago.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.863
Broke, aimless, losers.

02:10.865 --> 02:12.431
I was not
"aimless."

02:12.433 --> 02:13.799
I'm calling walter again.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.167
You've called him ten times.

02:15.169 --> 02:15.834
He's not
going to answer.

02:15.836 --> 02:16.835
Paige, then.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.837
She bailed on us.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.305
Who needs her?

02:20.307 --> 02:22.207
Then I'm calling cabe.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.709
Walter threw cabe off the team.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.178
No cabe, no paige--

02:26.180 --> 02:27.813
The scorpion you're thinking of

02:27.815 --> 02:29.181
Does not
exist anymore.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.350
Accept it and pull the rip cord.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.852
We're not going down
without a fight.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.187
Isn't this worth it?

02:35.189 --> 02:37.856
Call cabe.
What do I care?

02:41.728 --> 02:44.229
(phone ringing)

02:46.299 --> 02:48.534
So, I got your
new assignment.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.704
Pomona airport?
You're on a desk,

02:52.706 --> 02:54.940
But you're in charge
of all tsa.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.609
If you get bored, you could
strap on a blue uniform

02:57.611 --> 02:59.411
And work the
luggage scanner.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.780
Why do I get the sense
you're enjoying this?

03:01.782 --> 03:04.783
Scorpion's flameout
freed up funding for
certain pet projects,

03:04.785 --> 03:06.785
But this is all
you're doing, gallo.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.787
You were always
intimidated by them

03:08.789 --> 03:10.923
Because they're smarter
than you by a millionfold,

03:10.925 --> 03:13.559
Save countless lives,
and help countless more
than you ever could.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.327
Maybe pomona's too good for you.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.564
I'll never know.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.568
You can take this
assignment and shove it.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.605
How the hell am I supposed
to fix this team

03:26.607 --> 03:28.407
If no one's gonna pick up?
That was megan.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.576
Walter missed her weekly
doctor's assessment.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.578
He didn't even call.
She can't get ahold of him.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.845
That's not great.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.248
He's never missed
an appointment before.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.483
Megan thinks something could
be very wrong, and so do I.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.285
Or he's holed up
in a bar somewhere

03:40.287 --> 03:41.820
Throwing back
tequila bombs rewriting
the relativity theorem.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.222
Walter doesn't drink.
Then he's throwing back

03:43.224 --> 03:44.890
Milkshakes rewriting
the relativity theorem.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.392
Can I please have
a little emotional escapism

03:47.394 --> 03:48.961
While we trace his phone?

03:48.963 --> 03:51.230
On it.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.636
(line ringing)

03:57.638 --> 03:58.971
Recorded voice:
Hi. This is paige dineen.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.473
I can't come to the phone,
but leave a detailed...

04:04.277 --> 04:05.811
(phone line ringing)

04:07.981 --> 04:09.548
Are you calling walter again?

04:09.550 --> 04:12.251
Hi, walter.
It's me again.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.752
Can you call me back, please?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.854
I promise my call
will be efficient.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.490
I just want to
say good-bye.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.826
(electronic chime)

04:20.828 --> 04:23.362
(birds chirping)

04:26.566 --> 04:29.001
Why won't he pick up?
Ralph,

04:29.003 --> 04:30.335
You've already left
three messages.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.703
Now pack.
We're leaving soon.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.338
I don't want to go.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.274
It's two days.
And then it'll be forever.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.908
Go.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.413
(phone line ringing)

04:41.415 --> 04:43.282
Recorded voice:
This is walter o'brien.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.783
Please leave a brief message.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.852
Yeah, it's me this time.
I can't believe...

04:46.854 --> 04:51.290
I always knew you had issues,
walter, but this is...

04:51.292 --> 04:53.025
Way beneath you.

04:53.027 --> 04:56.461
You are selfish,
and you are being a jerk.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.562
(beep)

04:57.564 --> 05:00.999
(phone ringing)

05:02.335 --> 05:04.670
Glad you finally grew a pair.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.305
Uh, it's happy quinn.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.540
From the team
you were formerly a part of.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.976
Oh. Happy, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
I thought it was...

05:10.978 --> 05:12.544
I'm looking for walter.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.079
No.
You know where he is?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.881
Ralph has been trying
to call him all morning.

05:15.883 --> 05:16.982
Okay. Bye.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.550
Happy. Come on.

05:18.552 --> 05:22.554
No, no. That will not fit
in the bag-- it's not going.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.089
Going where?

05:24.091 --> 05:25.824
A little trip.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.892
You're moving this quick?

05:26.894 --> 05:28.093
No flies on you, girl.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.629
Drew invited us to portland
for the weekend

05:30.631 --> 05:33.398
Just to get a feel
for the place, but we wouldn't

05:33.400 --> 05:35.000
Great.
Move there till the end
of the school year.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.668
Bring a raincoat
and a mosquito net.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.070
Okay, you're obviously

05:38.072 --> 05:39.071
Upset with me.

05:39.073 --> 05:40.439
You come onto our team,

05:40.441 --> 05:42.374
Mess up with walt's head,
and get us used

05:42.376 --> 05:44.076
To having that kid around,
and then you up and leave.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.744
We were all good
before you came along.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.679
I am doing it
for the sake of my son.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.982
Before I came along,
you guys were a disaster.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.684
You've wormed your way
into walt's head,

05:52.686 --> 05:55.020
And that is a big reason
why he's mia right now.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.488
I don't need to listen to this.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.690
Then don't!

06:01.994 --> 06:03.595
(beep)

06:09.836 --> 06:12.738
His phone is cloaked,
and his gps is disabled.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.406
Walter, you clever bastard.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.375
You're killing us here.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.809
You'll never find him that way.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.644
Well, what do you care?

06:19.646 --> 06:21.113
You're already looking
for a new job.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.415
We can track
the car's onboard computer.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.851
All we need is the vin.
Elia...

06:25.853 --> 06:27.519
Would have that.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.856
Well, look who wants
to help now.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.091
Would you just admit
that you're on board

06:33.093 --> 06:34.593
With trying to save scorpion,
the greatest thing

06:34.595 --> 06:35.961
That ever happened to any of us.

06:35.963 --> 06:39.431
Guys... Elia's
playa vista headquarters.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.867
Mm.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.669
Toby:
Ma'am, I know there's a policy.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.471
Outside of family,

06:46.473 --> 06:48.673
Mr. Elia cannot be interrupted
during a meeting.

06:48.675 --> 06:52.110
But by saving his daughter,
we became de facto family.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.678
The notion is outlined
in a chinese proverb

06:53.680 --> 06:57.416
What I am familiar with
is the number for security.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.417
Sylvester:
Okay.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.718
We'll be sitting down now.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.957
You think walter isn't
calling us back because he's
preparing his exit strategy

07:05.959 --> 07:07.692
To come work here?
I mean...

07:07.694 --> 07:09.494
Look at this place--
we can't compete.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.029
It's not so great.
It is.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.731
Multiple dedicated t-1 lines,

07:12.733 --> 07:14.499
State-of-the-art engineering,

07:14.501 --> 07:17.702
Unlimited resources.
You know what this place
doesn't have? Us.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.438
Tobes and
the sly dog.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.705
And that's
what's gonna keep walter

07:20.707 --> 07:24.142
That guy is going down the hall
on a hoverboard!
Hey.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.812
(snapping fingers)
don't look.
Don't be seduced.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.882
Happy should be
in position by now.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.051
(speaking japanese)

07:36.222 --> 07:38.824
(gasping)

07:38.826 --> 07:40.058
What the hell?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.660
I need that vin number

07:41.662 --> 07:43.995
Of the bribe on wheels
you gave walter o'brien.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.832
I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.166
And I'm in the middle
of your conference table.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.801
You stuck your nose

07:49.803 --> 07:52.504
Where it didn't belong,
looking to break apart

07:52.506 --> 07:55.474
The only family
some of us have ever known.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.242
I was being friendly.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.478
You were poaching our boss.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.179
Now he's missing,
and I'm not leaving

08:01.181 --> 08:03.482
Without that vin.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.668
Onboard computer's pinging
right here.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.704
Do you see a car?
I see no car.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.905
Did elia
mislead us?

08:26.907 --> 08:28.740
Maybe he doesn't
want us to find him.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.509
Rat.
Happy: I'll call
walter again.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.014
It's ringing.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.216
(phone ringing in distance)
you hear that?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.787
(ringing continues)

08:43.756 --> 08:45.891
Hey, guys...

08:45.893 --> 08:49.160
(phone continues ringing)

08:53.032 --> 08:54.733
(ringing continues)

08:58.771 --> 09:01.072
(ringing continues)

09:04.577 --> 09:06.611
(ringing continues)

09:06.613 --> 09:08.179
Sylvester:
Aw, geez.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.181
Happy:
Okay, count of three,

09:10.183 --> 09:11.283
We yell his name.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.284
On three,
or two, three, then go?

09:12.286 --> 09:13.318
Which is
essentially four.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.553
On three.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.921
Okay, one, two...

09:15.923 --> 09:16.988
All:
Walter!

09:16.990 --> 09:18.990
(grunting)

09:18.992 --> 09:20.191
Others (calling):
Walter!

09:20.193 --> 09:23.261
(debris clattering)

09:23.263 --> 09:25.096
Others:
Walter!
(groans)

09:25.098 --> 09:27.866
(phone continues ringing)

09:30.069 --> 09:31.202
Hello?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.004
Oh! Walter?

09:33.006 --> 09:35.173
You're balanced
on a cliff's edge.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.808
One wrong move,

09:36.810 --> 09:38.677
And the car falls 300 feet.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.946
Stay very, very still.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.224
Toby:
Police and rescue are on their
way. How you holding up, walter?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.292
He doesn't sound good.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.261
Tell the doctor where it hurts.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.663
My left side.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.700
What's it look like?
Is it bruised or bleeding?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.301
I can't move to see.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.070
I'm pinned to the seat.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.972
Pinned how?
Something leaning on you, or...?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.940
Or what?

10:08.942 --> 10:09.941
Stay cool, walt.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.909
We'll have a visual

10:10.911 --> 10:12.377
On you in 30 seconds.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.647
Birdroni lives.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.782
It was gonna be your birthday
present, but I wasn't

10:17.784 --> 10:19.985
Done yet. I was gonna
mount a camera...

10:19.987 --> 10:21.653
We'll need one,
but I have a solution.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.122
Any duct tape in your truck?

10:25.157 --> 10:28.193
(metallic creaking)

10:28.195 --> 10:30.862
(walter panting,
drone whirring)

10:30.864 --> 10:34.199
You really did a number
on that car, o'brien.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.134
Yeah, well, I was doing fine

10:36.136 --> 10:39.004
Until an untimely interface
with mother nature.

10:39.006 --> 10:39.971
(walter groans)

10:39.973 --> 10:42.073
(whirring)

10:42.075 --> 10:43.675
This's what I was afraid of.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.277
So, it's, um, good news?

10:46.279 --> 10:48.647
Toby: Walter, you're impaled
on what looks like

10:48.649 --> 10:50.382
A piece of metal
from the guardrail.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.750
So, it's excellent news then.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.984
From the color of the blood

10:52.986 --> 10:54.386
And the position of the metal,

10:54.388 --> 10:56.321
Your body has been able
to clot off.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.989
Best scenario,
we keep it that way

10:57.991 --> 10:59.724
Until we can get you
to a hospital,

10:59.726 --> 11:01.292
But that means
no movement, nada.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.895
The wound is dangerously
close to his spleen.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.363
I thought
we don't need the spleen.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.232
We don't, but it's basically
a giant sack of blood.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.968
Never good to lose a giant sack
of blood.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.003
(walter panting)

11:12.005 --> 11:13.438
Walter, I know
it hurts like hell.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.073
You got to stay with me here.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.876
No, I was just...
I'm just running some numbers.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.912
Okay, so, I-I'm perched on...

11:20.914 --> 11:23.448
(groans) ...About a 71% grade?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.950
Give or take.
I don't have my protractor.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.086
I do-- 71.8.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.754
All right, okay,

11:29.756 --> 11:31.923
So, given my precarious hold
on the cliffside,

11:31.925 --> 11:34.025
The extent of my injuries,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.995
The time needed
for successful rescue...

11:36.997 --> 11:42.200
Sylvester, would you put this
at about a 97% chance of death?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.869
You know, walter, I've never
put much faith in numbers.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.072
(sirens blaring)
that's the police.
I'll coordinate.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.074
They need to know
who they're dealing with here.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.942
You don't handle
authority well!

11:50.944 --> 11:52.444
This is paige's job.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.945
Yeah, we don't need her.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.413
Paige. Where's paige?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.315
Taking a little r&r.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.817
(sirens blaring)

11:58.819 --> 12:01.286
She's taking ralph
to portland to see drew.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.788
I told her
it was a stupid idea.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.924
(tires squealing)
what the hell is this?! I said

12:05.926 --> 12:07.959
Fire department and
ambulance. Do you have

12:07.961 --> 12:11.329
All right, buddy, we're gonna
need you to take a step back.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.797
Whoa. I'm not your buddy,

12:12.799 --> 12:13.998
And if anybody's gonna
be condescended to,

12:14.000 --> 12:18.036
One of the great minds of
this or any other lifetime--

12:18.038 --> 12:20.839
And also my friend--
is clinging to life by a thread.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.041
We are formulating
a plan of rescue,

12:23.043 --> 12:26.111
And are gonna need
every resource at our disposal.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.213
The resources belong to trained
rescue personnel that...

12:28.215 --> 12:30.915
That don't have the brain
power of me with a hangover

12:30.917 --> 12:32.117
And this guy when
he's sleeping.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.451
So, first thing
we'll need,

12:33.453 --> 12:36.187
Officer, is a soil integrity
report on that cliffside

12:36.189 --> 12:38.289
So we can start working
toward a solution.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.992
Excuse me. Do you know
what this badge means?

12:40.994 --> 12:43.495
That you got "d"s
in high school?

12:43.497 --> 12:47.832
Actually,
I have a better solution.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.068
Don't get in the car.
Sly!

12:50.070 --> 12:51.069
Call cabe!

12:51.071 --> 12:52.403
Officer:
Quiet down. Come on.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.472
Track him down!

12:54.474 --> 12:56.808
(indistinct radio transmission)

12:58.277 --> 13:01.146
I'll admit, paige would
have handled this better.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.848
(sighs)

13:05.351 --> 13:07.418
(siren whoops)

13:16.929 --> 13:18.797
Cabe.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.434
Cabe, they're talking
about sending a team down

13:23.436 --> 13:25.170
With grappling hooks.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.172
Happy says this is going to
disrupt the soil beneath the car

13:27.174 --> 13:29.073
And drop it like a hot potato.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.208
They've shoved us aside.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.876
They won't listen to us.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.077
They're gonna kill him.

13:33.079 --> 13:36.114
All right.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.516
Who the hell's in charge
of this operation?!

13:38.518 --> 13:39.851
I am.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.353
Wrong! I am. Cabe
gallo, homeland.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.356
Now, get my behaviorist and
engineer out of that squad car

13:45.358 --> 13:46.858
And give my team some room.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.093
That man down there
is a government asset.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.461
Move!

13:50.463 --> 13:53.431
You heard the man. Move it!

13:54.600 --> 13:56.868
Did you just flash
your scuba certification?

13:56.870 --> 14:00.004
Yeah. I don't work
for homeland anymore.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.341
(indistinct radio transmission)

14:08.581 --> 14:11.883
Oh, my god.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.852
Cabe?

14:13.854 --> 14:16.087
Sylvester: Yes. We thought it
would be best to bring him in.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.290
Yeah, I'm here,

14:19.292 --> 14:22.293
And you don't like it,
you can yell at me later.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.597
Consider it a date.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.135
Our soil expert just confirmed
what ms. Quinn was saying.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.537
Thank you very much.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.440
To hook the chassis
and winch the car.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.208
A chopper extraction
might be faster.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.577
No, the rotor wash could upset
the car's balance.

14:39.579 --> 14:43.882
So, we're gonna send a team up
from the canyon floor.

14:43.884 --> 14:44.916
They'll approach
from underneath,

14:44.918 --> 14:46.150
Secure the vehicle from there

14:46.152 --> 14:47.485
Without going near
the support topsoil.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.087
But nothing's guaranteed,
and we're talking

14:49.089 --> 14:51.155
A half hour climb at least.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.925
(groans)

14:53.927 --> 14:56.327
If I hold out that long.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.595
I don't like that look.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.964
Do I need to throw down a copy

14:59.966 --> 15:02.901
I want to see the equipment
your team will be using,

15:02.903 --> 15:04.402
See if I can cut down
the amount of time

15:04.404 --> 15:05.570
It'll take them
to get to walter.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.605
Okay, walt. Happy's on it.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.674
We're gonna have a rescue team
up to you very soon.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.110
Yeah, really?
Because from what I heard,

15:12.112 --> 15:14.679
It won't be that soon...
Or at all.

15:14.681 --> 15:19.384
Guys, do you think, uh,
you could reach out to...

15:19.386 --> 15:24.255
To paige for me, um,
get her and ralph over here?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.924
I've actually already
reached out to them.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.158
Her phone is powered off.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.093
The last tower ping
was near her apartment.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.995
Look, there's gonna be plenty
of time to talk to her

15:30.997 --> 15:32.630
Once we get you back
up here with us.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.699
I'd really like to talk to her
as soon as possible.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.669
I'm getting a black and white
sent to her home right now.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.103
Thank you.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.406
Go find this woman.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.143
Cabe, uh...

15:47.079 --> 15:49.080
Cabe, when I was 16 years old...

15:49.082 --> 15:50.949
What I did with
baghdad was wrong.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.717
You have every right
to be mad at me.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.118
No, I was

15:54.120 --> 15:57.288
Hurt and, uh... I overreacted.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.724
I was, uh... Emotional,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.160
And, uh, ineffective, and

16:02.162 --> 16:04.996
If I'd been logical,
then I'd, uh...

16:04.998 --> 16:06.998
I'd have realized the man

16:07.000 --> 16:09.968
Who knew me when I was younger
would never hurt me on purpose.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.740
Thank you, walter.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.676
Cabe, you told me that
when your daughter passed away,

16:18.678 --> 16:21.679
You'd visit her grave
every Sunday?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.681
Yes.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.017
Without fail.

16:26.019 --> 16:30.555
The grass at her plot-- it was
always, uh, green, healthy?

16:30.557 --> 16:32.523
And the others were brown?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.025
I hacked the sprinkler system.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.760
I, uh, watered it

16:35.762 --> 16:38.062
Twice a day.
The others were...

16:38.064 --> 16:40.631
Once, uh, a week.

16:40.633 --> 16:44.469
I always thought that
was the groundskeeper

16:44.471 --> 16:47.405
Taking pity on me,
'cause I was there alone.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.141
No, it was me.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.414
15 years ago, you were so
mad at me about baghdad.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.716
Why would you do that for me?

16:58.718 --> 17:00.718
That's not the point.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.653
The point is
that I don't want there

17:02.655 --> 17:04.756
To be any more secrets
between us.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.562
Guys, we got a problem!

17:11.564 --> 17:13.664
The engine.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.233
Walter:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.135
Yup, this is a problem.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.670
(drone whirring)

17:19.672 --> 17:21.439
Spin the drone around!

17:21.441 --> 17:22.607
Smoke!

17:23.609 --> 17:25.176
Happy:
Uh, it's from the oil pan.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.511
It must have been

17:26.513 --> 17:28.579
An electrical short
caused by the accident.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.082
If the flame gets to the gas
tank, the whole car goes up.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.084
Water cannon will blow the car
right off that perch.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.252
A fire retardant

17:34.254 --> 17:35.486
Might be better.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.756
You can't control the
weight distribution even with

17:38.758 --> 17:40.291
Foam or gel.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.260
Well, if we can't douse it,
maybe we can prevent it

17:42.262 --> 17:43.461
From spreading
to the gas tank.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.695
Cabe: How?
I have no idea.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.763
It was just a conceptual notion.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.533
Fire can't burn without fuel.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.768
Guys, we need to drain the oil.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.504
We can't go down there
and put you up on blocks.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.672
You don't need blocks.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.107
You have an ambulance
and a fire truck.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.111
Paige:
<i>Ralph, come on.</i>
<i>Clock's ticking.</i>

18:04.616 --> 18:06.784
What's going on?

18:06.786 --> 18:09.187
I'm not pleased
with this plan.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.422
Think of all the firsts.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.791
Ride in a plane,
see the atlantic ocean.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.561
There's something
wrong with walter.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.830
Why didn't he pick up?

18:20.632 --> 18:22.867
Walter is...

18:22.869 --> 18:24.869
Going through a lot right now,

18:24.871 --> 18:26.871
And it's best
we leave him alone.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.640
Just follow our own path,
just for today.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.210
Okay?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.484
Okay.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.487
(elevator bell dings)

18:53.165 --> 18:55.833
(coughing)

18:55.835 --> 18:59.170
Guys, not to pressure anyone,
but a, uh, a status update

18:59.172 --> 19:02.640
On my, uh, proposed solution
would certainly be comforting.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.475
We're working on it.
Okay, aim it
at the car.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.910
I thought we said
that that would

19:05.912 --> 19:08.913
Okay, just do it, and
then, get me the jacket and

19:08.915 --> 19:11.182
The duct tape I need. Now!
(walter groans)

19:11.184 --> 19:13.885
Before this entire car
is engulfed.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.253
I got the dart!

19:15.255 --> 19:18.256
Ten steel syringe needles--
best I could do.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.333
Sylvester!
Sylvester:
Okay. You have a target

19:29.335 --> 19:31.936
Surface area of eight square
inches. You need to hit the pan

19:31.938 --> 19:33.938
Low enough to ensure full
drainage away from the car,

19:33.940 --> 19:34.872
Or else, kaboom.

19:34.874 --> 19:38.543
Is getting up to about
130 degrees, give or take.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.578
We're gonna have enough
force to penetrate the pan?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.446
Standard psi is 55,000,

19:42.448 --> 19:44.949
Comparable to an m40a1
sniper rifle.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.584
Sylvester:
Your margin of error
is 2.2 inches

19:46.586 --> 19:49.887
A syringe dart shot
out of a water hose, guys.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.888
I just don't know.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.390
Chief, I just don't care.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.193
Fire in the hole,
so to speak.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.931
How we doing?

19:59.933 --> 20:01.933
Ever hear of adding fuel
to the fire?

20:01.935 --> 20:03.668
We just did the opposite.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.903
Nothing left to burn--
it'll be out in seconds.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.942
The car's shifting.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.610
It's the weight loss
from the drained oil.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.945
Uh, walter,
compensate for the weight.

20:13.947 --> 20:16.314
Lean the seat back
as far as you can.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.316
Okay. Okay.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.351
(low creaking)

20:22.821 --> 20:23.988
(yells)

20:23.990 --> 20:26.290
(walter gasps)
(exhales)

20:26.292 --> 20:27.592
(coughing)

20:27.594 --> 20:29.393
(groans loudly)

20:29.395 --> 20:31.295
Yeah, that wasn't a scream
of fear, that was pain.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.396
What's going on
down there?

20:32.398 --> 20:34.298
Well, the good news is...

20:34.300 --> 20:36.834
(grunts) with the shift in
the car, I'm no longer impaled.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.837
The bad news is
there's a-a great degree

20:39.839 --> 20:41.973
Of bright red blood just

20:41.975 --> 20:44.308
Spewing out... My wound.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.977
That sounds like an
arterial bleeder.

20:45.979 --> 20:48.879
That shard of guardrail must
have been in the spleen.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.716
The blood coagulated around it;
now it's been ripped out.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.819
How long does he have?
If he's really bleeding
out, four minutes.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.829
Toby:
Walter, you got to get pressure
against that wound to stem

21:04.831 --> 21:08.499
The bleeding.
(weakly):
I am. It's not...

21:08.501 --> 21:10.268
It's not working.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.769
He doesn't sound good.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.671
Hey, walter!
Walter, listen to me!

21:13.673 --> 21:15.740
You have to fight the urge
to close your eyes.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.742
Do not close your eyes.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.377
Find paige.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.478
We're losing him.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.912
You're the doctor.
Do something!

21:21.914 --> 21:23.714
Can't exactly cauterize
the wound from here,

21:23.716 --> 21:25.616
Sylvester.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.385
Or can I?

21:27.387 --> 21:29.587
Holy crap, am I smart.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.990
But it won't work if you die
before I can implement it.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.059
So you have to stay conscious.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.728
Wal-walter, walter, hey, hey,

21:37.730 --> 21:39.630
You have to stay awake
so I can get

21:39.632 --> 21:42.767
A good look at your wound.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.769
(car creaking quietly)

21:46.705 --> 21:48.839
(panting)

21:52.344 --> 21:54.712
(continues panting)

21:56.581 --> 21:58.616
(electrical crackle)

21:58.618 --> 21:59.784
(groans)

21:59.786 --> 22:01.852
(labored breathing)

22:03.488 --> 22:04.822
(electrical crackling)

22:04.824 --> 22:05.890
(pained grunt)

22:05.892 --> 22:07.758
You okay in there, son?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.060
Just trying to stay awake.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.528
Toby:
Okay, hey,

22:10.530 --> 22:11.796
Walter, I can see the wound.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.964
It is bad. You're
gonna have to cauterize it,

22:13.966 --> 22:16.701
'cause my arms
are not nearly long enough.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.936
Listen carefully.
Find a thin piece of metal.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.871
(panting)

22:24.376 --> 22:25.876
I see a pen.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.446
Okay. Reach for it slowly.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.014
(metallic creaking)
(groans)

22:30.016 --> 22:31.716
Oh, boy.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.755
Oh, yeah, of course elia
would have a silver pen,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.790
Rich jerk, but that's good.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.692
'cause silver
conducts heat fast.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.862
Now, press in
the cigarette lighter.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.798
(labored breathing)

22:49.000 --> 22:50.868
You okay back there?

22:50.870 --> 22:54.772
Huh? You want me to put
that science cd in you like?

22:58.377 --> 23:01.379
Sweetheart,
I know you're upset...

23:01.381 --> 23:02.813
It's not finished.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.014
What isn't, sweetheart?

23:04.016 --> 23:06.851
The rocket.
Walter and I need to finish it,

23:06.853 --> 23:08.953
But you
won't let us.
(soft groan)

23:08.955 --> 23:10.821
I'm gonna miss him.

23:11.790 --> 23:12.757
I know.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.859
Me, too.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.894
Don't leave it there too long.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.863
We need it to be hot,
not glowing.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.598
Yeah? All right.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.799
Fantastic.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.100
That's perfect.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.835
Walter, walter, hey!

23:24.837 --> 23:26.904
Keep those peepers
popped, buddy.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.406
Okay, now here's
the rough part.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.840
I can't watch this.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.042
Okay, walter, you need
to press the pen

23:32.044 --> 23:34.445
Into the wound
past the rib cage.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.881
When you feel the spleen...
How do I know it's the spleen?

23:36.883 --> 23:39.183
The pen will stop moving
and you'll feel the pulses

23:39.185 --> 23:42.553
Of the artery transmitted
through the pen.

23:42.555 --> 23:45.556
Oh, man.
When you feel the spleen
touch the hot metal

23:45.558 --> 23:47.992
Against the organ
in short little bursts,

23:47.994 --> 23:50.494
It'll stop the bleeding, but
it'll preserve the tissue.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.629
You can do this, son.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.902
(loud, pained grunting)
(sizzling)

23:57.904 --> 23:59.870
Cabe: Walter,
no matter how bad it hurts,

23:59.872 --> 24:00.971
You got to stay still,

24:00.973 --> 24:02.840
Or that car's gonna fall.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.875
Walter (grunting):
Toby...

24:04.877 --> 24:08.846
Do you remember the '07...
World series of poker when, uh,

24:08.848 --> 24:11.015
When... You made me go
to vegas with you?

24:11.017 --> 24:12.783
How could I forget?

24:12.785 --> 24:15.486
And you m-made me s-stay
in that...

24:15.488 --> 24:18.622
(chuckles):
That crappy hotel room...
Off the strip?

24:18.624 --> 24:19.957
(pained grunt)

24:19.959 --> 24:21.091
God, this hurts.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.194
El ranchorito.
Wasn't <i>that</i> bad.

24:23.196 --> 24:26.030
And you won that...
Gangster's bankroll in that...

24:26.032 --> 24:27.832
Back-alley crap game?

24:27.834 --> 24:29.900
(groans)
he and his friends...

24:29.902 --> 24:34.905
(panting, laughing):
Uh... With crowbars
for nine blocks?

24:34.907 --> 24:37.842
We had to hitchhike...
Back to l.A.?

24:37.844 --> 24:40.010
I remember every
minute of it, walt.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.813
It was one of the best weekends
of my life.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.950
I need to take a look.
How much longer?

24:45.952 --> 24:47.818
Can you move your hand away?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.521
(groans)

24:50.523 --> 24:51.889
Okay.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.858
Yeah, the bleeding
has stopped substantially.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.260
Great work, pal,
great work. Now...

24:56.262 --> 24:59.029
Take a beat
and catch your breath.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.535
(quietly):
Nice work, doc.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.171
The way he's
telling the stories
from back in the day,

25:07.173 --> 25:09.907
It's like he's
almost at his own wake.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.209
We got to get him
out of there.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.978
He might be giving up.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.981
Okay. This is our gate.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.850
Now we need to get you
some yogurt and fruit,

25:19.852 --> 25:24.288
Because I assume you'll
find airplane food lacking
in nutritional content.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.857
What do you want
from the newsstand,
discover or <i>smithsonian?</i>

25:26.859 --> 25:27.858
Ralph.

25:27.860 --> 25:33.564
Newsman:
The cliffside rescue attempt on
mulholland drive is underway

25:33.566 --> 25:36.901
To save walter o'brien, head of
the genius problem-solving team

25:36.903 --> 25:37.902
Known as scorpion.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.870
Oh, my god!

25:39.872 --> 25:42.573
Come on!

25:42.575 --> 25:44.275
(horn honking, tires squealing)

25:45.744 --> 25:47.978
I can't find anything
on the news!

25:47.980 --> 25:49.246
Mom?
What?!

25:49.248 --> 25:50.247
I'm sorry.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.849
Is walter gonna be okay?

25:51.851 --> 25:53.117
Yes. Of course he will be.
I just need

25:53.119 --> 25:54.285
To call the guys.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.953
Damn it, I left my bag
at the airport!

25:55.955 --> 25:56.987
Hold on, ralph.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.824
Copy that.
Relaying the data now.

26:00.826 --> 26:04.662
Recent changes in the position
of the car are forcing them

26:04.664 --> 26:06.664
To change their course.
They can't just go straight up.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.133
They have to try
to up and around.
How long?

26:09.135 --> 26:10.834
Fire chief & sylvester:
22 minutes minimum.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.803
Walter might not
have that long.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.939
Thanks to him
shifting around in there,

26:14.941 --> 26:16.807
The ground's moved
under the car in a way

26:16.809 --> 26:18.242
That even the slightest change
in weight distribution

26:18.244 --> 26:19.910
Can upset the balance

26:19.912 --> 26:23.914
I'm sorry, pal--
I thought the phone was off.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.082
That's okay.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.684
Any luck finding paige?

26:29.321 --> 26:31.689
Uh, still nothing, buddy.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.857
I called again--
not answering her phone.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.859
Too bad we don't have
a southern bell

26:35.861 --> 26:37.828
(chuckles):
Two-slot pay phone circa 1991.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.096
Happy:
Stop it!

26:39.098 --> 26:40.931
I know what you're doing--
you're talking

26:40.933 --> 26:43.267
About that pay phone
I rigged for free calls

26:43.269 --> 26:44.802
When we first opened the garage

26:44.804 --> 26:46.337
'cause we
couldn't afford a phone.

26:46.339 --> 26:48.906
Well, you sure fixed that
for us, didn't you?

26:48.908 --> 26:50.374
Okay, I'm not having it!

26:50.376 --> 26:53.277
Okay? I will not let you
eulogize a memory of you and me.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.213
You have three geniuses up here
putting their heads together.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.248
We will figure this out,
you will not die--

26:58.250 --> 27:00.951
The situation is under control!

27:00.953 --> 27:04.121
(clacking)

27:04.123 --> 27:06.223
Sylvester,
you're into bird-watching--

27:06.225 --> 27:08.359
How much does a crow weigh?

27:08.361 --> 27:09.994
Decent size:
1.2 pounds.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.228
Why?

27:11.230 --> 27:12.930
(crow caws)
one just landed on my hood.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.632
(metallic creaking)

27:17.369 --> 27:19.637
A pound of pressure on the lever

27:19.639 --> 27:21.171
At the greatest distance
from the fulcrum

27:21.173 --> 27:23.107
Can create enough force
to start the beginning

27:23.109 --> 27:25.042
Of a slide which results
in gravitational pull.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.044
Which results
in car overboard.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.413
If that bird flies off...

27:29.415 --> 27:30.881
Walter dies.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.887
Guys, the car's starting
to tilt...

27:36.889 --> 27:39.223
Ever so downward.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.958
Copy that.
We're aware of the situation,

27:40.960 --> 27:42.326
And handling it.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.394
(beep)

27:43.396 --> 27:45.829
How are we
handling this?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.398
Uh, the fire department's
got a hook and ladder

27:47.400 --> 27:49.667
Parked up around that bend.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.669
It would never extend out
far enough.

27:51.671 --> 27:54.038
I know, but I saw
construction work
down the road from here.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.373
I have an idea,
and it works on
the same principle!

27:56.375 --> 28:00.678
If you fly off, the reverse
torque from weight distribution

28:00.680 --> 28:02.746
Will cause my death.

28:03.915 --> 28:07.317
You don't really care
about that, do you?

28:07.319 --> 28:09.019
He's talking
to the bird.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.424
Newswoman:
<i>Rescue crews are at a loss</i>
<i>of how to extract the man</i>

28:13.426 --> 28:15.759
Identified as one walter o'brien
from the car

28:15.761 --> 28:17.795
Before it completes its fall
down the cliff.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.463
With me is tomas kolbrenner,

28:19.465 --> 28:21.832
Usc professor
of structural engineering,

28:21.834 --> 28:26.403
Mr. Kolbrenner, given the
situation, what's the likelihood
come on, go faster!

28:26.405 --> 28:27.971
Of a successful rescue?
(horn honks)

28:27.973 --> 28:29.306
Kolbrenner:
Well, I hate to morbid, jackie,

28:29.308 --> 28:31.408
But I don't see a scenario
where mr. O'brien

28:31.410 --> 28:33.410
Makes it out alive.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.413
Don't listen to them--
they don't know what scorpion's

28:36.415 --> 28:37.414
Capable of.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.482
Baby...

28:39.384 --> 28:42.720
(crying):
He's my friend.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.463
Toby (over phone):
<i>How's tweety doing?</i>
<i>Staying put?</i>

28:52.465 --> 28:55.032
Walter:
<i>For now. We have a plan?</i>

28:55.034 --> 28:57.768
Uh, yeah, happy left here
like a bat out of hell,

28:57.770 --> 28:59.403
And you know her--
she says she's got an idea,

28:59.405 --> 29:01.472
She's got an idea.
(truck's horn blows)

29:01.474 --> 29:02.806
What is that?

29:05.477 --> 29:07.978
Her idea.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.314
Cabe:
You borrowed a crane
from a construction site?

29:10.316 --> 29:13.183
Not exactly.
You <i>stole</i> a crane
from a construction site?

29:13.185 --> 29:14.251
Exactly.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.386
Uh, walt,
here's the plan.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.789
I am going to hook cabe up
to the end of a crane,

29:18.791 --> 29:21.258
Like a wrecking ball,
and swing him out

29:21.260 --> 29:22.760
Over the canyon
to your car.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.228
He'll connect you
via safety line,

29:24.230 --> 29:26.363
And we'll pull you both back in.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.366
Amazingly, not the craziest
thing that we've ever done.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.335
It's been a busy year.

29:31.337 --> 29:35.439
To unlock the passenger-side
door so cabe can get to you.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.775
But move with extreme caution
as to, you know,

29:37.777 --> 29:38.542
Not get killed.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.879
More than falling down
the side of a cliff?

29:41.881 --> 29:44.114
All right. Point taken.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.352
Happy:
Okay.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.854
Now I got to fashion a harness
for you to wear.

29:50.856 --> 29:54.525
I'll get some tech 12 cable
from search and rescue.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.493
Uh, cabe.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.829
The car falls
when you're hooked to walter

29:58.831 --> 30:01.165
And his body gets caught inside?

30:01.167 --> 30:04.067
The hoist line snaps
and you will go down with him.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.306
Just get the harness ready.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.346
(exhales)

30:17.816 --> 30:19.883
(grunting)

30:20.819 --> 30:22.553
(groans)

30:22.555 --> 30:24.421
(crow cawing)

30:26.191 --> 30:27.925
Don't move, crow.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.328
(moaning loudly)

30:31.330 --> 30:32.429
(crack)

30:33.164 --> 30:35.966
(panting)

30:35.968 --> 30:38.068
What was that sound?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.603
His collarbone.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.338
Oh.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.375
Oh, no.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.077
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:47.079 --> 30:48.612
You got to turn this around.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.848
My-my friend is on that cliff!
Ma'am,

30:50.850 --> 30:52.516
There are no cars allowed
past this point. I need you

30:52.518 --> 30:53.917
To turn it back around.
All right. Okay.

30:58.489 --> 31:00.257
Okay, ralph. Let's go.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.259
Come on.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.594
Come on, let's go.

31:03.596 --> 31:05.462
Come on.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.397
Come on, ralph.

31:08.566 --> 31:10.534
Okay, when we tell you to,
open the car door.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.536
The weight shift will cause
the car to instantly fall.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.538
But that won't matter because
cabe will have already hooked

31:14.540 --> 31:16.406
Your safety line to him.
The car falls

31:16.408 --> 31:18.876
While you hang safely in the air
with supergallo.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.345
Walter:
Okay. Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere

31:21.347 --> 31:23.280
Until I talk to paige.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.148
Ground underneath that car is
getting more and more unstable.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.150
That bird can amscray
at any moment.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.353
We have got
to get this party started

31:29.355 --> 31:31.655
As soon as happy is done rigging
that harness.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.657
Toby,
there is a strong possibility

31:33.659 --> 31:35.459
That this thing does not work!

31:35.461 --> 31:38.395
If so, then I need to talk
to paige and ralph.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.565
He's not gonna open that door
until they get here.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.933
No matter what.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.668
'cause the last thing
walter o'brien

31:44.670 --> 31:46.637
Wants to do before he dies

31:46.639 --> 31:48.171
Is state facts, and the fact

31:48.173 --> 31:49.339
He's tried
to tell us,

31:49.341 --> 31:51.141
In his own way,
is that he loves us.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.677
So why do you think
he wants paige here so badly?

31:53.679 --> 31:56.580
(crow caws)

31:56.582 --> 31:58.282
So I'm gonna feed the line
through the window

31:58.284 --> 31:59.983
And you're gonna hook
it around your waist.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.519
Cabe, if this thing doesn't
work, then you need to tell her.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.955
Tell paige what, son?

32:04.957 --> 32:06.256
Tell her that I...

32:07.025 --> 32:08.225
Toby:
Oh, no!

32:08.227 --> 32:09.626
Bird's on the move! Move!

32:09.628 --> 32:11.962
He flies off, it's all over.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.231
Happy,
how much longer?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.599
I'm not ready!

32:15.601 --> 32:17.668
Well, get ready.

32:24.976 --> 32:26.543
Happy, we got
to get going.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.211
I only have one line.
You need two.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.614
Not an option.
Get me out there now.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.383
Is this it, pal?
You're gonna fly off?

32:33.385 --> 32:36.186
Well, you do what you
got to do, but...

32:36.188 --> 32:37.454
(caws)
if you could just stay put

32:37.456 --> 32:38.722
For a little bit longer,

32:38.724 --> 32:41.391
I'd-I'd really
appreciate it.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.327
The proximal half
of the bird's wings are flexing.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.262
It's preparing to fly.
And if I've picked up on that,

32:45.264 --> 32:46.330
So has walter.

33:02.246 --> 33:04.314
Come on!

33:05.483 --> 33:07.250
(grunts)
walter!

33:07.252 --> 33:09.419
Walter!

33:09.421 --> 33:11.989
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Walter.
(panting)

33:11.991 --> 33:13.323
Paige,

33:13.325 --> 33:15.025
I just want you to know...

33:15.760 --> 33:16.460
No!

33:16.462 --> 33:18.295
(creaking)

33:18.297 --> 33:19.062
Open the damn door!

33:19.064 --> 33:22.265
(grunting loudly)

33:22.267 --> 33:23.000
Walter!

33:23.002 --> 33:24.501
(creaking)
no!

33:29.741 --> 33:30.707
(grunting loudly)

33:30.709 --> 33:32.476
(grunting)

33:39.784 --> 33:41.518
(shouting)

33:46.624 --> 33:48.558
I won't let go if you won't.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.693
Deal.

34:04.642 --> 34:06.710
(grunting)

34:08.346 --> 34:10.414
(panting)

34:15.353 --> 34:16.820
(sputters)

34:16.822 --> 34:19.089
(panting)

34:21.259 --> 34:23.727
I don't feel so well.

34:40.611 --> 34:45.082
Woman (over p.A.):
Radiology, 135. Radiology, 135.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.683
Hey. He awake yet?

34:46.685 --> 34:48.585
Not yet.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.388
You brought
balloons.

34:51.390 --> 34:54.391
What's he gonna do?
Knock 'em around the room

34:54.393 --> 34:56.760
With his broken ribs
and punctured spleen?

34:58.262 --> 34:59.729
Hey, everybody.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.136
If you're here about your car,
it's wrecked.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.571
Don't care
about the car.

35:07.573 --> 35:08.839
Just checking on walter.

35:08.841 --> 35:10.841
I'm sorry. This is family only.

35:11.809 --> 35:13.610
Understood.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.479
Will you at least let him know
that I stopped by?

35:15.481 --> 35:16.880
And if there's anything
that he needs...

35:16.882 --> 35:19.816
You'll be right there to
try and steal him away again?

35:19.818 --> 35:21.818
After what I saw unfold
on tv today,

35:21.820 --> 35:24.154
Breaking up a
family like this,

35:24.156 --> 35:25.555
That would
be criminal.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.224
Please just keep me posted
as to how he's doing.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.863
But if you would <i>all</i> like
to come

35:32.865 --> 35:35.232
Work with me, I'd be crazy
not to have a group like you

35:35.234 --> 35:36.800
Working for
my think tank.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.668
Food for thought?

35:38.670 --> 35:39.503
Nope.

35:39.505 --> 35:40.470
Uh-uh.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.605
No way.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.907
Scorpion appreciates the offer,
but, um,

35:43.909 --> 35:45.475
We're not corporate material.
We're a team.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.245
We work out of a garage,
not a tank.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.779
And we work alone.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.848
Fair enough.

35:53.618 --> 35:58.155
Um, what's this
"we" stuff, pilgrim?

35:58.157 --> 36:00.457
Yeah. What about maine?

36:00.459 --> 36:02.926
Uh, I don't know, ralphy.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.228
What about maine?
It's cold and wet.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.398
(chuckles)

36:08.400 --> 36:10.901
What gave it away?
Was it the balloons?

36:10.903 --> 36:14.671
He's weak and tired but stable.
He's gonna be okay.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.541
Can we see him?

36:17.543 --> 36:19.209
It's way past visitation,

36:19.211 --> 36:21.244
So it'll have to be quick.
Follow me.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.652
(knocking)

36:28.654 --> 36:30.187
Hey, guys.

36:30.189 --> 36:34.491
Hey yourself,
mario andretti.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.927
The sawbones patch you up okay?

36:36.929 --> 36:39.663
Yeah, I've felt better.
But... Never better.

36:39.665 --> 36:40.897
If that makes sense.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.266
Doesn't.
But you've had a head injury.

36:43.268 --> 36:45.402
Eh.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.938
Hey, you brought balloons.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.206
Thank you.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.740
See?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.742
Sly, do you remember
that time that...

36:52.744 --> 36:54.211
We filled that balloon
with tapioca

36:54.213 --> 36:55.612
And then we took
that catapult...

36:55.614 --> 36:58.582
Walter, you don't need
to take me down memory lane.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.717
But thanks.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.485
I love you, too.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.621
(chuckling):
Hey. Hey, pal.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.626
It's good to see you.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.494
It's good to see you, too.

37:12.730 --> 37:13.997
Doctor:
Okay.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.899
It's morphine
time, which means

37:15.901 --> 37:17.567
He's gonna be out like a light
in about a minute.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.237
It's time for
good-byes.
All right.

37:20.239 --> 37:23.306
We will see you back at work
when you're all better, okay?

37:26.477 --> 37:28.478
Back to work?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.714
Yeah. Back at work.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.618
(grunts, mumbles)

37:35.419 --> 37:37.287
That put a smile on his face.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.755
That and the drugs.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.291
Bye.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.498
Okay. I'm gonna
go see megan.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.033
She's worried sick
about her brother.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.835
I'm gonna hit
the epsom salts.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.903
Swinging off a crane does
a number on your back.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.940
I... I think might
hang back for a bit

37:56.942 --> 37:58.408
In case walter needs anything.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.944
He's doped-up
like a tijuana drug mule.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.546
Just in case.
Happy, would you mind keeping

38:03.548 --> 38:04.781
An eye on ralph
for a few hours?

38:04.783 --> 38:09.052
Getting his butt kicked
in constructo-battle.

38:10.054 --> 38:12.355
You want to babysit with me?

38:12.357 --> 38:14.024
Of course I would.

38:14.026 --> 38:16.926
Hey, be good. They've
had a long day, okay?

38:18.062 --> 38:19.296
(quietly):
Thanks for not

38:19.298 --> 38:21.331
Making me leave them.

38:32.743 --> 38:34.944
Uh, is it all right
if I stay for a while?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.547
Sure. But he's
down for the count.

38:37.549 --> 38:40.617
He won't be
awake for hours.
Okay.

38:43.788 --> 38:45.855
(rhythmic beeping)

38:51.696 --> 38:56.032
Thought for a moment today
I'd seen you for the last time.

38:56.034 --> 38:59.636
It really bothered me
that if that had happened,

38:59.638 --> 39:03.840
Our final memory together
would've been... A fight.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.344
I'm really glad
that wasn't the case.

39:07.346 --> 39:10.413
Because...

39:26.997 --> 39:31.067
Because I really care about you,
walter.
