WEBVTT

00:05.973 --> 00:09.410
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.112
AND WHEN THE BATTER
STARTS TO BUBBLE,

00:11.145 --> 00:12.780
YOU GO UNDER IT LIKE THIS
AND JUST FLIP IT OVER.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.815
OH, YOU ARE SO GOOD AT
FLIPPING THINGS OVER.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.150
MM... ( chuckles )

00:16.184 --> 00:18.486
AND PANCAKES ARE RUINED FOREVER.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.189
MEL, YOU KNOW HOW YOU
COMPLAINED FOR THREE DAYS

00:21.222 --> 00:22.323
THAT THERE WAS NO BREAKFAST?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.192
TODAY WE'RE MAKING IT FOR YOU.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.560
- ( Joey chuckles )
- FLIP!

00:26.594 --> 00:28.329
YOU JUST DID THAT SO WELL.
I'M TELLING YOU...

00:28.362 --> 00:30.464
SHE'S LIKE A NATURAL.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.400
HAVE YOU REALLY ONLY BEEN
HERE FOR THREE DAYS?

00:32.433 --> 00:34.568
IT JUST... IT SEEMS
LIKE SO MUCH MORE.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.271
LOVEMAKING GOES SO FAST
WHEN YOU'RE WITH JOSEF.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.340
WHOA... WHAT? (
laughs ) NO NO NO NO.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.309
WHAT I THINK SHE
MEANT WAS THAT TIME

00:41.342 --> 00:42.610
HAS REALLY FLOWN BY
SINCE SHE'S BEEN HERE.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.546
OH, WELL, TO ME, TIME IS
KIND OF STANDING STILL

00:45.579 --> 00:48.349
AND GROSSING ME OUT.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.184
SO WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING TODAY?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.553
( scoffs )

00:52.586 --> 00:54.288
BESIDES THAT.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.490
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY

00:56.524 --> 00:58.192
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT OUTSIDE TODAY.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.562
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW
ELENA SOME OF THE SIGHTS.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.231
OH, DO WE HAVE TO?

01:03.264 --> 01:05.366
OH, NO NO...

01:05.399 --> 01:08.102
MY VACATION WILL
BE OVER SO SOON.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.637
IT'S SO SAD.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.405
OH, BUT MAYBE YOU
COULD HAVE VACATION

01:11.439 --> 01:12.640
AND COME TO RUSSIA?

01:12.673 --> 01:14.642
MEL, WHEN IS JOE'S VACATION?

01:14.675 --> 01:17.611
OH, WELL, IT SURE SEEMS LIKE
HE'S TAKING SOME VACATION

01:17.645 --> 01:19.247
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW...
'CAUSE NOT A LOT'S

01:19.280 --> 01:21.149
GETTING DONE AT
THE HOUSE LATELY.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.185
YOU COULD COME TO SEE ME, JOSEF,

01:24.218 --> 01:26.120
AND THEN I COULD
COME BACK HERE AGAIN

01:26.154 --> 01:29.557
AND BACK AND FORTH,
AND BACK AND FORTH...

01:29.590 --> 01:31.659
OH, MY GOD. YOU DO THAT SO WELL.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.328
I PERSONALLY DON'T CARE FOR IT.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.663
RELAX, WILL YA?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.331
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO GET
DONE AROUND HERE, OKAY?

01:37.365 --> 01:38.566
AND YOU ARE GOING TO
LOVE DINNER TONIGHT.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.534
OH, ARE YOU COOKING IT, JOSEF?

01:40.568 --> 01:42.670
- WHAT WILL IT BE?
- I AM GOING TO MAKE

01:42.703 --> 01:44.538
MY FAMOUS EGGPLANT PARMESAN.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.474
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE FOOD THINGS?

01:46.507 --> 01:48.576
JOE'S FAMOUS EGGPLANT PARMESAN.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.879
IT'S MISSING ONE INGREDIENT...
JOE.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.547
WELL, WHAT IS HE DOING?
UGH, NEVER MIND.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.649
I KNOW WHO HE'S DOING.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.219
- ARE WE GOING TO STARVE?
- I'M NOT.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.520
I'M GOING TO HAVE THAT SLICE
OF CAKE I'VE BEEN SAVING.

01:59.553 --> 02:03.224
OH, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THIS SLICE OF CAKE ALL DAY LONG.

02:03.257 --> 02:06.160
( winces ) MY SLICE
OF CAKE IS GONE.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.596
- WHO ATE IT?
- OH, DON'T LOOK AT US.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.631
- WE WOULD NEVER.
- YEAH.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.435
OH, THAT'S MY CAKE...

02:14.468 --> 02:16.337
PLEASE, EXCUSE FOR
THE INTERRUPTION.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.705
Joe: ARE YOU COMING BACK, BABY?

02:17.738 --> 02:20.708
COMING COMING! THIS
CAKE WAS DELICIOUS.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.611
- I WISH THERE WAS MORE.
- OH, ME TOO.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.713
MORE CAKE, LESS YOU.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.481

02:27.515 --> 02:29.183

02:52.005 --> 02:53.741
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'VE
ONLY GOT A MINUTE.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.643
I'M TAKING ELENA OUT TO
SEE TOLEDO'S HOT SPOTS.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.978
YOU KNOW... OTHER THAN ME.
( clears throat )

02:58.011 --> 03:00.648
OKAY, WELL, I'LL TRY NOT TO
TAKE UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME

03:00.681 --> 03:02.250
WITH SOME TRIVIAL MATTERS
LIKE, OH, I DON'T KNOW...

03:02.283 --> 03:04.452
FORGETTING THE KIDS AT SCHOOL.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.387
SO I WAS A LITTLE
LATE PICKING THEM UP.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.489
AND IN YOUR BOXER SHORTS.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.324
I GOT SEVERAL CALLS FROM MOMS.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.426
BUT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.628
JOE, THIS GOES BEYOND CARPOOLS.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.664
YOU'RE LETTING ELENA
ENCROACH IN MY HOME,

03:16.697 --> 03:18.466
YOUR JOB, MY CAKE.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.733
I'LL MAKE YOU ANOTHER CAKE.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.736
HOW WILL THAT HELP ME
EAT CAKE YESTERDAY?

03:22.770 --> 03:24.705
YOU'RE RIGHT. LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.240
I'LL MAKE YOU ANOTHER CAKE.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.741
PFFT, AND SEND IT FROM RUSSIA?

03:27.775 --> 03:30.778
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.581
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.650
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,
I DATED A JANE HAYFEE.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.751
HOT HOT HAYFEE.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.620
MY ROOMMATE WAYNE COMPLAINED
ABOUT HER ALL THE TIME,

03:39.653 --> 03:41.255
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
WAYNE WAS SINGLE.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.591
SEE, AND EVERY TIME HE SAW
ME AND JANE TOGETHER,

03:43.624 --> 03:46.527
LIKE IN, YOU KNOW, THE
SHOWER OR WHATEVER,

03:46.560 --> 03:49.797
IT REMINDED HIM OF HOW
SINGLE AND LONELY HE WAS.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.799
OH, SO YOU THINK I'M YOUR
LONELY ROOMMATE WAYNE?

03:51.832 --> 03:55.403
YOU SMELL A LITTLE
BETTER, BUT YEAH.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.804
LOOK, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

03:56.837 --> 03:58.606
WITH ME BEING LONELY
AND SINGLE...

03:58.639 --> 04:01.542
WHICH, OH, BOY, I AM NOT.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.743
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR GUEST

04:02.776 --> 04:04.378
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF MY GENEROSITY.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.813
YOU KNOW, IN SOME CULTURES,
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FRIENDLY

04:05.846 --> 04:07.415
TO THEIR GUESTS.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.750
EXCUSE ME, I AM THE
FRIENDLIEST PERSON I KNOW.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.286
I... I... I HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDLY.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.522
IN FOURTH GRADE, I WAS
THE CLASS GREETER

04:14.555 --> 04:16.824
FOR CAREER DAY, AND
I DIDN'T VOLUNTEER.

04:16.857 --> 04:20.428
I WAS PICKED.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.696
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT JOE SAID

04:22.730 --> 04:24.465
THIS WHOLE ELENA
PROBLEM IS ABOUT.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.833
HE SAYS IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT...

04:25.866 --> 04:28.569
- GETTING ANY?
- FRIENDLY.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.471
HEY, IT'S NOTHING
I WANTED TO HEAR.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.773
ELENA'S GOING TO BE GONE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.575
WHY ARE YOU LETTING IT
BOTHER YOU SO MUCH?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.810
WELL, THE REAL REASON... WHICH
JOE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR...

04:36.844 --> 04:38.812
IS THAT IN WHIRLWIND
AFFAIRS LIKE THIS

04:38.846 --> 04:40.448
PEOPLE GET HURT.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.450
PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.852
NO. BIG NO. THIS IS ABOUT JOE.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.820
LOOK, I HAVE HAD MY SHARE
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.456
OKAY? AFTER COLLEGE,

04:48.489 --> 04:50.391
I HAD A THREE-MONTH
EURORAIL PASS,

04:50.424 --> 04:51.859
AND LET'S JUST SAY
MY VISA GOT PUNCHED

04:51.892 --> 04:53.761
AT A FEW DIFFERENT STOPS.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.763
UGH!

04:55.796 --> 04:57.531
I'M JUST SAYING...
THINGS LIKE THIS

04:57.565 --> 04:59.367
BURN HOT AND HEAVY, BUT
THEN THEY FLAME OUT.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.602
AND ALL YOU'RE LEFT
WITH IS, YOU KNOW,

05:01.635 --> 05:04.772
WARM, SHAMEFUL MEMORIES.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.106
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.341
UGH!

05:07.375 --> 05:09.743
ANYWAY, IF JOE THINKS THIS IS
ANYTHING MORE THAN A FLING,

05:09.777 --> 05:10.811
HE'S KIDDING HIMSELF.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.481
OR JOE COULD GO
VISIT HER IN RUSSIA

05:13.514 --> 05:16.517
AND THE RELATIONSHIP
COULD HAVE A FUTURE.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.118
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF...

05:18.151 --> 05:19.720
I WAS EAVESDROPPING.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.889
YEAH, I SAID IT, BUT I
DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.491
I DON'T SEE THAT
HAPPENING AT ALL.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.359
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING
I DO SEE AROUND HERE

05:25.393 --> 05:27.561
IS DIRTY DISHES IN THE SINK,
DUST BUNNIES ON THE FLOOR,

05:27.595 --> 05:29.363
AND A TABLE FULL OF JUNK FOOD.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.765
WHAT, IS THIS JOE'S IDEA
OF A GOOD LUNCH NOW?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.901
NO, IT'S MY IDEA OF A LUNCH.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.769
IN FACT, IT'S EVERY
MEAL FROM NOW ON.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.806
BREAKFAST BURRITOS, GUMMY
WORMS, CHOCOLATE WING-WANGS...

05:38.839 --> 05:41.709
I'M EATING IT ALL IN THE
NAME OF JOURNALISM.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.711
OH, DOES JOURNALISM LIKE A
LITTLE JUNK IN THE TRUNK?

05:43.744 --> 05:47.481
NO, THE SCHOOL VENDING MACHINE
IS TRYING TO KILL US ALL.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.882
YOU KNOW MY FRIEND
MAZIE GOODMAN?

05:48.916 --> 05:49.817
BIG GIRL?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.820
SHE HAS TWO JELLY DONUTS
FOR LUNCH EVERY DAY.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.822
THEN SHE SUGAR CRASHES AND
FALLS ASLEEP IN MATH.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.791
WELL, THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT
THE SCHOOL IS DOING TO US KIDS.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.927
SO I'M GOING TO EAT NOTHING
BUT VENDING MACHINE FOOD

05:59.960 --> 06:01.729
AND CHRONICLE WHAT
HAPPENS TO ME.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.863
WOW, I THINK YOU'RE REALLY
GOING TO INSPIRE SOME PEOPLE

06:02.896 --> 06:05.666
TO MAKE HEALTHIER CHOICES.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.935
OH, MALTED MILK BALLS!
( squeals )

06:07.968 --> 06:10.638
I'LL CHRONICLE THESE.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.740
TERRIBLE. IT'S JUST TERRIBLE.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.810
OH, AWESOME! IS
THIS FOR YOUR BLOG?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.546
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY CRAP.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.548
I'M THE ONE WHO HAS
TO EAT ALL OF THIS.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.950
I'M SAVING MY FRIEND AND A
GENERATION OF AMERICA'S YOUTH.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.819
SO BACK OFF.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.589
OH! PINK BALL OF DEATH.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.491
WHY DON'T I DO ALL
THE EATING FOR YOU?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.426
I'LL CHOKE DOWN ALL THIS
TRANS-FATTY GOODNESS

06:32.460 --> 06:33.894
AND YOU CAN DO ALL THE WRITING.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.163
- MY GUTS, YOUR GLORY.
- FINE.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.698
BUT YOU CAN ONLY EAT FOOD
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.468
HEY, MAN, NO ONE'S ARGUING.

06:43.971 --> 06:47.441
DID I JUST SEE YOU PUT POP
ROCKS IN THAT BURRITO?

06:47.475 --> 06:49.877
YEAH. IT'S AN EXPLOSION
OF MEXICAN FLAVOR.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.845
OH, LIKE A LITTLE HAT
DANCE IN YOUR MOUTH?

06:51.879 --> 06:54.214
MM. SI.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.850
- UH-OH.
- RYDER?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.886
YOU KNOW, UM, MAYBE SOME THINGS

06:58.919 --> 07:01.589
WEREN'T MEANT TO
BE MIXED TOGETHER.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.592
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.927
( softly moans )

07:09.029 --> 07:11.198
HEY, MEL.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.734
OH, THE LOVEBIRDS ARE HERE.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.903
JOSEF TOOK ME FOR FIRST
TIME ON FERRIS WHEEL.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.805
WE WERE UP SO SO HIGH.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.006
THE VIEW WAS INCREDIBLE.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.508
IT ALWAYS IS WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.477
- AWW.
- UGH!

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.516
AND NOW I MUST GO UPSTAIRS
BECAUSE I HAVE POOPED.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.751
I HOPE YOU MEAN YOU A POOPED.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.920
YES. THAT.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.888
THANK YOU FOR A
WONDERFUL DAY, JOSEF.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.490
YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.025
YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE
BEFORE I HAVE TO GO?

07:38.058 --> 07:40.027
WHAT? YOU ARE LEAVING?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.662
YEAH, YOU REMEMBER?
I TOLD YOU THAT

07:41.695 --> 07:42.996
THAT FRIEND OF MINE
FROM BUSINESS SCHOOL

07:43.030 --> 07:44.532
IS THROWING THAT BIG
POKER EVENT TONIGHT,

07:44.565 --> 07:45.899
AND HE INVITED ALL OF
HIS BROKER BUDDIES

07:45.933 --> 07:48.035
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT CHANCE
FOR ME TO DO SOME NETWORKING

07:48.068 --> 07:50.270
AND UNFORTUNATELY I JUST
CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS IT.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.973
CAN'T WE GO TOGETHER?

07:53.006 --> 07:56.043
ELENA, IF I SHOW UP WITH YOU,

07:56.076 --> 07:57.778
NO ONE'S GOING TO
BE TALKING TO ME.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.047
NO. BESIDES, I THINK THIS
WILL BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

08:00.080 --> 08:02.716
FOR YOU AND MEL TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.284
YOU KNOW, THE TWO
LADIES IN MY LIFE.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.686
HANGING OUT. YOU KNOW?

08:05.719 --> 08:08.021
AND THIS WOULD BE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU

08:08.055 --> 08:10.658
TO SHOW ELENA HOW
FRIENDLY YOU ARE.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.527
( chuckles ) THAT'S
SO NOT NECESSARY.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.895
YEAH! COME ON. IT'LL BE GREAT.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.664
YOU KNOW? YOU TWO HAVE
SO MUCH IN COMMON.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.700
I MEAN, YOU'RE BOTH
HIGH-POWERED CAREER WOMEN...

08:21.635 --> 08:23.871
( clears throat )

08:23.904 --> 08:25.939
AND THERE'S THIS.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.641
HMM? ( chuckles )

08:27.675 --> 08:29.810
THERE WE GO. I PROMISE I
WILL NOT BE OUT TOO LATE.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.012
OKAY? MWAH.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.814
GOOD NIGHT. NIGHT, BURKE.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.850
( door closes )

08:42.790 --> 08:44.625
WELL...

08:44.658 --> 08:46.660
SO...

08:47.795 --> 08:49.797
( sighs )

08:53.133 --> 08:55.335
( sighs )

08:55.368 --> 08:57.838
( murmurs, clears throat )

08:57.871 --> 09:00.040
YOU LIKE WOMEN, NO?

09:00.073 --> 09:01.942
WHAT... WHAT... WHY
WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

09:01.975 --> 09:04.011
THESE SHOES JUST HAPPEN
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.914
HOW IS IT YOU CAN
LIVE WITH JOSEF

09:06.947 --> 09:09.950
AND NOT WANT TO JUMP UP AND
DOWN ON HIS BONES ALL THE TIME?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.753
I OFTEN WANT TO JUMP UP
AND DOWN ON HIS BONES,

09:12.786 --> 09:14.788
BUT ONLY WHEN I'M WEARING
BIG, HEAVY BOOTS.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.857
YOU MAKE JOKE.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.358
I WISH I MAKE JOKE.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.794
( both chuckle )

09:20.828 --> 09:23.130
AND AFTER UNIVERSITY,
IT TOOK MANY YEARS

09:23.163 --> 09:25.098
TO RISE UP THE CORPORATE
RANKS AT PRODKO.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.734
IT IS VERY HARD

09:26.767 --> 09:29.002
TO BE BUSINESSWOMAN IN
SUCH A SEXIST COUNTRY.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.939
DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAY "FEMALE
EXECUTIVE" IN RUSSIAN?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.774
YOU DON'T.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.142
BUT YOU DIDN'T LET THAT
STOP YOU, DID YOU?

09:35.175 --> 09:38.011
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- OH, NYET, YOU DIDN'T.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.782
LET'S DRINK TO YOU.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.617
I AM DETERMINED PERSON.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.619
WHEN I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING, I DO IT.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.120
AND WHEN I WANT TO DO SOMEONE,

09:47.154 --> 09:49.089
I DO IT.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.725
NA ZDAROV'E!

09:53.927 --> 09:55.128
( sighs )

09:55.162 --> 09:56.897
YOU KNOW, I AM TRULY IMPRESSED.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.399
YOU ARE SELF-ASSURED, AND TOUGH,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.168
AND... AND... AND ACCOMPLISHED.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.036
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE
A RUSSIAN ME...

10:03.070 --> 10:04.805
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW
IF I WOULD BE SO COOL

10:04.838 --> 10:06.173
ABOUT LETTING JOE GO OUT
WITH THE GUYS TONIGHT.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.041
SO? WHAT IS BIG DEAL?

10:08.075 --> 10:10.744
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF I TRAVELED
5,000 MILES TO VISIT A GUY,

10:10.778 --> 10:12.112
AND HE LEFT ME FOR A
"SPECIAL POKER NIGHT,"

10:12.145 --> 10:13.914
I'D BE PRETTY UPSET.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.916
YOU'D BE CRYING, WEEPY GIRL?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.185
EXCUSE ME, NO... I'D BE PUTTING
ON MY BONE-STOMPING BOOTS

10:18.218 --> 10:20.654
AND HE'D BE CRYING, WEEPY BOY.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.924
SO JOE GOING OUT FOR BOYS' NIGHT

10:23.957 --> 10:25.125
IS BAD THING?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.160
WELL, IT'S NOT BAD.
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

10:27.194 --> 10:32.065
SELFISH, AND IMMATURE, AND...
PFFT... MALE.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.801
DON'T LISTEN TO ME. I'M DRUNK.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.804
YOU KNOW, SO HEY... NA ZDAROV'E!

10:36.837 --> 10:38.739
HEY, I SWEAR, THE
MORE VODKA I HAVE,

10:38.772 --> 10:40.908
THE BETTER I PRONOUNCE THAT.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.010
HEY! GOOD EVENING, LADIES.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.145
( speaking Russian )

10:45.178 --> 10:46.780
HEY, JOE!

10:46.814 --> 10:48.816
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:48.849 --> 10:51.451
( speaking Russian )

10:51.484 --> 10:53.987
IDIOT! ( speaks Russian )

10:54.021 --> 10:55.222
OH, I THINK SHE'S SAYING

10:55.255 --> 10:58.926
"I MISSED MY BIG
AMERICAN LOVER."

10:58.959 --> 11:01.028
HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH
THINGS TO ME, JOSEF?

11:01.061 --> 11:03.897
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE AND GO PLAY
POKING WITH YOUR BOYFRIENDS.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.899
OKAY. ( chuckles )

11:05.933 --> 11:08.235
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S...
IT'S POKER.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.870
AND THEY'RE NOT MY BOYFRIENDS.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.839
THOSE GUYS WERE BROKERS, AND I
DIDN'T LEAVE YOU HERE ALONE.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.106
- I LEFT YOU WITH MEL.
- YES.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.776
AND GOOD THING. SHE
GOT MY EYES OPEN.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.110
REALLY? NO, I MEAN,

11:17.144 --> 11:18.946
I THINK THEY WERE PRETTY
OPEN WHEN YOU GOT HERE...

11:18.979 --> 11:21.248
YOU KNOW, LIKE WAH!

11:21.281 --> 11:25.919
YOU ARE A SELFISH,
THOUGHTLESS, MALE... MAN!

11:27.287 --> 11:29.289
ELENA.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.829
( yawning ) OH, I'M SO TIRED.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.265
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT THE
HELL DID YOU SAY TO HER?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.467
WHO, HER? PFFT. NOTHING.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.136
NOTHING? SHE LIKED
ME WHEN I LEFT HERE.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.872
( whistling )

11:44.905 --> 11:46.907
YOU BROKE HER.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.242
( Elena speaking Russian )

11:49.276 --> 11:51.979
ELENA, COME ON. JUST OPEN
UP THE DOOR, ALL RIGHT?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.881
CAN'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT IT?

11:53.914 --> 11:56.016
- ( speaking Russian )
- HOW'S IT GOING?

11:56.049 --> 12:00.487
( speaking Russian )

12:00.520 --> 12:02.990
LIKE THAT.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.025
HEY, LOOK, I'VE BEEN ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF A DOOR OR TWO.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.794
TELL HER... ( speaks Russian )

12:06.827 --> 12:08.161
IT MEANS, "I'M SORRY."

12:08.195 --> 12:09.963
WHAT? WE HUNG OUT. I
PICKED UP A FEW PHRASES.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.900
( speaks Russian )

12:12.933 --> 12:15.969
( sighs ) ELENA...

12:16.003 --> 12:18.238
( speaks Russian )

12:18.271 --> 12:20.908
YEAH, THAT WORKED GREAT.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.309
YOU JUST GOT STARTED.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.944
LOOK, ELENA MAY BE FROM
HALF A WORLD AWAY,

12:23.977 --> 12:25.913
BUT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE
SAME LANGUAGE... APOLOGY.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.548
UM, TELL HER, "IT HURTS
ME WHEN I SEE YOU CRY."

12:28.581 --> 12:30.150
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE
OVER THE TOP?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.052
TRUST ME. AND DON'T ROLL
YOUR EYES WHEN YOU SAY IT.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.921
WE CAN HEAR THAT.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.791
FINE. ( sighs )

12:37.825 --> 12:40.127
IT HURTS ME WHEN I SEE YOU CRY.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.930
REALLY?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.031
YOU'RE SPECIAL.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.133
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU FIND
SOMEONE YOU CONNECT WITH,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.201
AND I CONNECT WITH YOU.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.304
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL, ELENA.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.073
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
THAT YOU FIND SOMEONE

12:53.106 --> 12:56.043
THAT YOU CONNECT WITH, AND I...
I REALLY CONNECT WITH YOU.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.946
I... I DIDN'T REALIZE
UNTIL JUST NOW

12:58.979 --> 13:00.147
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.150
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE TILL NOW
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.

13:03.183 --> 13:07.087
- ( sighs )
- AND...

13:07.120 --> 13:08.956
AND?

13:08.989 --> 13:11.959
AND I'M GONNA MISS YOU WHEN
YOU'RE IN RUSSIA, JOE.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.094
- ( sighs )
- WHAT?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.963
I MEAN, YOU... TELL HER
YOU'RE GONNA MISS HER

13:15.996 --> 13:17.998
WHEN SHE'S GONE, JOE.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.103
ELENA, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF TIME LEFT, SWEETIE.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.105
PLEASE DON'T MAKE US SPEND IT

13:25.138 --> 13:27.841
WITH THIS DOOR BETWEEN US.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.279
( unlocks door )

13:32.312 --> 13:35.048
- NOW YOU GO IN, AND YOU...
- THANK YOU, BURKE.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.085
I CAN HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.998
( crunches loudly )

13:51.031 --> 13:54.902
( crunching )

13:58.906 --> 14:00.874
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

14:00.908 --> 14:04.011
A CHOCOLATE WING-WANG.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.113
SHOW ME THE WRAPPER.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.315
OKAY! IT'S A CARROT.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.951
WE HAD A DEAL. HOW COULD YOU?

14:10.984 --> 14:12.886
I'VE EATEN NOTHING BUT
VENDING MACHINE FOOD

14:12.920 --> 14:14.955
FOR TWO DAYS. NOW...
NOW I'M BLOATED,

14:14.988 --> 14:16.289
AND TIRED, AND EVERYTHING
COMING OUT OF ME

14:16.323 --> 14:18.926
IS AS UNNATURAL AS
WHAT'S GOING IN.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.294
I'VE ONLY POSTED ONE
BLOG ARTICLE SO FAR.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.030
THE MAZIE GOODMANS OF THE WORLD

14:23.063 --> 14:24.664
ARE COUNTING ON US TO
COME TO THEIR RESCUE.

14:24.697 --> 14:28.168
I THINK I'M GONNA YAK
UP A GUMMY SQUIRREL.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.439
NEVER MIND. IT RAN BACK DOWN.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.307
YOU'RE DOING
IMPORTANT WORK HERE,

14:34.341 --> 14:36.243
AND YOUR BRAVERY
INSPIRES US ALL.

14:36.276 --> 14:40.147
NOW... MAN UP AND...

14:40.180 --> 14:41.414
EAT YOUR BREAKFAST.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.051
CAN I AT LEAST PUT
SOME MILK IN IT?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.353
I THINK YOU KNOW THE
ANSWER TO THAT.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.926
- HEY, MEL.
- HEY, JOE.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.461
HOW DID EVERYTHING WORK OUT
WITH ELENA LAST NIGHT?

14:54.494 --> 14:57.264
OH, SHE WAS STEAMING.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.933
SO WAS THE MAKE-UP SEX.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.401
MM, YOU KNOW, A
SIMPLE THUMBS-UP,

15:01.434 --> 15:03.336
THUMBS-DOWN WOULD DO.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.238
LOOK, I'M SORRY IF I
STIRRED THINGS UP.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.374
MAYBE YOU AND ELENA DO
HAVE A FUTURE TOGETHER.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.977
YOU KNOW? MAYBE NOTHING
TERRIBLE WILL HAPPEN.

15:11.311 --> 15:15.315
JOSEF, SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.450
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH MY BOSS IN RUSSIA.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.386
THERE IS ENORMOUS
SCANDAL AT PRODKO.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.956
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- IN RUSSIA WE CALL IT "PONZI SCHEME."

15:22.990 --> 15:25.125
THE GOVERNMENT HAS
SHUT DOWN THE COMPANY

15:25.158 --> 15:26.359
AND ARRESTED ALL THE EXECUTIVES.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.295
BUT I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.130
OH, I'M SURE YOU
DIDN'T, SWEETIE.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.965
WHEN I RETURN TO ST. PETERSBURG,

15:31.999 --> 15:34.067
I'M SURE TO BE ARRESTED.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.069
OH, JOSEF, I'M SO SCARED.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.304
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.306
LOOK LOOK, WE'RE GONNA...

15:39.339 --> 15:41.174
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, OKAY?

15:41.208 --> 15:43.010
- RIGHT, MEL?
- YOU BETCHA.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.445
YEAH, WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.414
( mouthing words )

15:57.424 --> 16:00.093
SO WE SPENT ALL DAY
TRYING TO FIND ELENA

16:00.127 --> 16:01.361
SOME LEGAL COUNSEL
AND WE GOT NOTHING.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.330
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT SOMETHING.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.499
OH, YEAH, SHE HAD NEVER
SEEN AN OUTLET MALL BEFORE.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.536
SEE THAT? RETAIL THERAPY
CROSSES ALL CULTURES.

16:09.569 --> 16:14.374
I'M GOING TO GO PUT ON MY
FANCY NEW BRAS AND WEEP.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.743
THANK YOU FOR TRYING SO
HARD TO HELP ME, JOSEF.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.445
MWAH.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.782
- ( door closes )
- DAMN.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.151
YOU KNOW, ELENA'S
GOING TO GET ARRESTED

16:24.184 --> 16:25.785
AS SOON AS SHE
RETURNS TO RUSSIA.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.520
AND THEN WHO KNOWS WHAT
COULD HAPPEN TO HER?

16:27.554 --> 16:31.024
HEY, YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT THING.
CAN'T YOU HELP HER?

16:31.058 --> 16:33.426
YEAH, I COULD GET HER
A PARADE PERMIT.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.363
LOOK, JOE, ELENA IS A
TOUGH, INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.431
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
HER WAY OUT OF THIS JAM.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.200
I DON'T KNOW... THEY'VE GOT
SOME PRETTY TOUGH JAMS

16:40.233 --> 16:41.368
IN HER COUNTRY. I
JUST WISH THERE

16:41.401 --> 16:43.170
WAS SOME WAY FOR HER TO
STAY HERE IN THE U.S.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.804
UNTIL IT WAS SAFE
FOR HER TO RETURN.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.406
WELL, THERE ARE
THE OBVIOUS WAYS.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.375
UM, SHE COULD FAKE
HER OWN DEATH.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.343
SHE COULD GET PLASTIC SURGERY,

16:50.377 --> 16:51.578
OR, YOU KNOW, SHE COULD
MARRY MY UNCLE JIMMY

16:51.611 --> 16:53.446
AND MAYBE THEN HE'D
STOP ASKING ME.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.049
THAT'S IT! NOT YOUR
CREEPY UNCLE JIMMY THING,

16:56.083 --> 16:57.450
BUT THE WHOLE MARRIAGE THING.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.087
WAIT A MINUTE... IF SHE MARRIED A U.S.
CITIZEN,

17:00.120 --> 17:02.389
I COULD SAVE HER FROM
BEING EXTRADITED.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.524
- ELENA!
- WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.360
BACK UP THE WHITE
STEED, SIR LONGOLOT.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.196
GREEN CARD MARRIAGES
ARE ILLEGAL.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.497
YOU COULD BOTH GET
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.500
YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.202
YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT.
I WAS JUST...

17:15.235 --> 17:16.436
GRASPING AT STRAWS, YOU KNOW?

17:16.469 --> 17:18.238
'CAUSE I JUST DON'T WANT
HER LIFE TO BE RUINED

17:18.271 --> 17:19.506
BY THIS FINANCIAL
SCANDAL LIKE MINE WAS.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.375
WELL, LOOK, YOU'RE UPSET
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.311
BUT THAT'S THE BEST THING
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW...

17:24.344 --> 17:26.546
IS JUST BE HER FRIEND.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.615
OH, BUT IF SHE DOES WANT
THAT PLASTIC SURGERY OPTION,

17:28.648 --> 17:30.550
TELL HER NOT TO GO
TO MY MOM'S GUY

17:30.583 --> 17:32.152
BECAUSE HER BELLY
BUTTON IS UP TO HERE.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.525
WOW, THIS FOOD LOOKS FANTASTIC.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.393
YEAH, WELL, THIS IS
ELENA'S FAREWELL DINNER

17:40.427 --> 17:42.162
SO I WANTED TO MAKE IT SPECIAL.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.297
I PREPARED ALL OF THE
RUSSIAN CLASSICS.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.566
I SEE... PORK AND BEEF POLMENY,

17:46.599 --> 17:48.468
BORSCHT, POTATO VARENIKI...

17:48.501 --> 17:50.403
THAT'S RIGHT. AND FOR
DESSERT, MY HOMEMADE CANNOLI.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.472
CANNOLI? THAT'S NOT
A RUSSIAN DESSERT.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.575
YEAH, BUT NOTHING'S
BETTER THAN MY CANNOLI.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.278
DIG IN, EVERYBODY, BEFORE
THE POLMENY GETS COLD

17:58.311 --> 18:00.447
AND THE BORSCHT GETS WARM.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.282
OH, MY GOD! VEGETABLES.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.551
I WANT TO MAKE OUT
WITH THIS BROCCOLI.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.586
HEY, WHAT ABOUT LENNOX'S
JUNK FOOD RESEARCH?

18:06.619 --> 18:10.123
I'M DONE. I'VE EATEN MY
LAST TRANS-FAT GUT-BOMB.

18:10.157 --> 18:13.893
MY BLOG POST SPREAD LIKE
HEAD LICE IN A KINDERGARTEN.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.528
PARENTS WENT NUTS.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.464
SO THE SCHOOL GOT RID
OF ALL THE JUNK FOOD

18:17.497 --> 18:20.233
AND THEY'RE STOCKING THE VENDING
MACHINES WITH ONLY HEALTHY STUFF.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.270
- WELL DONE, LENNOX.
- YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE BEGIN,

18:23.303 --> 18:27.274
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING
TO OUR GUEST OF HONOR.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.542
ELENA, I'M GOING TO
MISS YOU SO MUCH.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.244
MM.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.281
I'LL MISS THE WAY THAT YOU
HUGGED ME IN THE MORNINGS...

18:34.314 --> 18:36.383
HUGGED ME VERY...

18:36.416 --> 18:37.684
VERY TIGHTLY.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.720
SUCH SWEET BOY.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.158
RYDER, WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS, BUDDY.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.595
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.563
ELENA, EVEN THOUGH SOME...

18:50.597 --> 18:53.566
TOUGH TIMES LIE AHEAD, I KNOW
YOU WILL OVERCOME ALL OF THEM.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.170
I THINK YOU ARE AN
EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG

18:57.204 --> 18:59.339
AND INSPIRATIONAL
WOMAN, 'CAUSE...

18:59.372 --> 19:01.708
IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.643
THANK YOU, MEL.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.279
I WOULD ALSO LIKE
TO MAKE SOME TOAST.

19:06.313 --> 19:10.317
YOU HAVE ALL OPENED YOUR
HOME AND YOUR HEARTS TO ME.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.320
I WILL HAVE MANY TROPICAL
TOLEDO MEMORIES TO KEEP ME WARM

19:13.353 --> 19:16.523
ON THOSE COLD SIBERIAN NIGHTS.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.258
I MAKE JOKE!

19:18.291 --> 19:19.592
NOBODY GETS SENT TO
SIBERIA ANYMORE.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.228
( both chuckle )

19:21.261 --> 19:22.529
WE GO TO FORCED LABOR CAMP

19:22.562 --> 19:23.930
AND TRY NOT TO
CATCH TUBERCULOSIS

19:23.963 --> 19:26.266
WHILE AWAITING TRIAL.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.235
NA ZDAROV'E!

19:28.268 --> 19:30.670
Mel and Joey: NA ZDAROV'E!

19:30.703 --> 19:33.206
YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOTTA
SAY SOMETHING NOW.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.741
ELENA...

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR VERY LONG,

19:36.709 --> 19:38.611
BUT IN THE SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME THAT WE HAVE,

19:38.645 --> 19:40.580
I HAVE REALLY GROWN TO...

19:40.613 --> 19:42.682
RESPECT YOU, AND
ADMIRE YOU, AND...

19:42.715 --> 19:44.651
TRULY CARE ABOUT YOU.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.587
AND THERE IS NO WAY I'M GONNA
LET YOU GO BACK TO RUSSIA

19:47.620 --> 19:51.258
AND BE PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING
THAT YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.993
SO, ELENA ROMANOV,

19:54.026 --> 19:56.363
WILL YOU MARRY ME AND BECOME A U.S.
CITIZEN?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.298
- WHAT?!
- ( stammers )

19:58.331 --> 20:00.500
YOU ARE SERIOUS? YOU
WOULD DO THIS FOR ME?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.669
YOU BET I WOULD. SO
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

20:02.702 --> 20:06.639
I SAY... DA!

20:07.674 --> 20:09.676
THIS IS THE HAPPIEST
MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.514
HOLY CANNOLI.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.253
LOOK AT THAT, RYDER.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.390
NOT A MOLECULE OF
POLYSORBATE-60 IN SIGHT.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.657
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
IF PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE

20:24.691 --> 20:26.025
GOOD CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.328
SOMEONE ELSE HAS TO MAKE
GOOD CHOICES FOR THEM.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.697
ARE YOU LENNOX SCANLON?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.565
- YEAH.
- YOU WROTE THAT BLOG STORY

20:32.599 --> 20:34.000
ALL ABOUT THE JUNK FOOD?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.636
YES. IT WAS JUST
SOMETHING I HAD TO DO.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.005
IT'S HER. SHE'S THE ONE
THAT MADE THE SCHOOL

20:39.038 --> 20:42.309
PUT ALL THE HEALTHY STUFF
IN THE VENDING MACHINES.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.711
- ( chuckles ) SEE YA.
- LET'S GET HER!

20:52.485 --> 20:54.721
YO. I'VE GOT SUGARY,
PROCESSED CRAP HERE.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.722
THREE BUCKS A POP.
