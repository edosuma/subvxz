00:02.003 --> 00:04.164
Previously on Lost:

00:04.255 --> 00:08.168
Some lawyers came to see me. They
wanted to test to see if Aaron's my son.

00:08.259 --> 00:09.544
You need to take care of them.

00:09.635 --> 00:13.674
Wouldn't you do anything you had to
in order to keep Aaron?

00:13.764 --> 00:14.844
Hello, Kate.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.183
He's with me.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.303
He's the one trying to take Aaron.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.554
It was me.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.227
Sorry.

00:29.822 --> 00:30.937
Charlotte!

00:31.032 --> 00:34.524
We have to go to The Orchid where
this started, maybe where it'll stop.

00:34.619 --> 00:36.530
This is happening because they left,

00:36.621 --> 00:38.782
I think it will stop
if I bring them back.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.496
What is your name?

00:45.588 --> 00:46.668
Jin.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.964
I am Danielle. Danielle Rousseau.

01:32.635 --> 01:33.750
Mama.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.218
Why don't you leave me
and my son alone?

02:21.309 --> 02:23.174
'Cause he's not your son, Kate.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.147
- Move away, Kate.
- Sun...

02:30.234 --> 02:31.349
I said move away.

02:31.444 --> 02:34.936
- Sun, what're you doing? Where's Aaron?
- He's in the car.

02:36.032 --> 02:39.149
- I know you think you're helping...
- If it wasn't for you,

02:39.243 --> 02:43.361
- Jin would still be alive.
- I didn't kill your husband, Sun.

02:43.456 --> 02:45.663
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

02:46.459 --> 02:48.199
Neither did anyone else.

02:48.294 --> 02:49.659
Because he's not dead.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.424
- You're lying.
- No, Sun.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.881
Jin's still alive.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.005
And I can prove it.

03:16.072 --> 03:18.063
Four, eight...

03:18.157 --> 03:23.242
...15, 16, 23, 42.

03:23.329 --> 03:27.538
Four, eight, 15, 16...

03:30.127 --> 03:32.459
Are you all right?

03:32.546 --> 03:36.880
- You Rousseau? Danielle Rousseau?
- Yes. That's right.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.052
- Where you from?
- We sailed from Tahiti.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.879
- When?
- November 15th.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.430
No. What year?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.425
1988.

03:49.814 --> 03:50.974
Why?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.062
What's the matter?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.188
I need go find my camp.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.021
- What camp?
- You were on this island before?

04:00.116 --> 04:02.027
You see helicopter?

04:16.590 --> 04:20.082
Is there an antenna on this island?
Jin! Please.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.042
Is there...

04:22.138 --> 04:24.379
...a radio tower?

04:29.353 --> 04:30.559
OK.

04:31.564 --> 04:32.644
Like that.

04:32.731 --> 04:37.020
- Is there a radio tower here?
- Yes.

04:38.195 --> 04:42.404
But I must find my camp,
because maybe helicopter go there...

04:42.491 --> 04:45.198
Do you know where
your camp is from here?

04:48.789 --> 04:51.030
- No.
- How about from the radio tower?

04:54.670 --> 04:57.628
- Yes.
- Then go with us to the tower.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.251
Then we'll find your camp.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.209
OK.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.941
- Are you ready to go?
- Yes.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.110
Who are you hoping to find?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.247
My wife.

05:40.591 --> 05:45.836
Four, 8, 15, 16...

05:45.930 --> 05:48.137
...23, 42.

05:48.807 --> 05:53.471
Four, 8, 15, 16...

06:30.349 --> 06:31.634
Nadine?

06:37.690 --> 06:38.930
Nadine?

06:39.775 --> 06:40.890
Nadine!

07:09.305 --> 07:10.294
Did you hear that?

07:11.849 --> 07:13.180
What is that?

07:15.019 --> 07:16.555
Monster.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.663
- We go find her.
- No! We must go.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.051
You shut up.

07:55.768 --> 07:57.474
Nadine!

07:58.562 --> 08:00.143
Nadine!

08:01.398 --> 08:02.854
Nadine!

08:06.445 --> 08:07.434
Nadine!

08:09.239 --> 08:10.900
Nadine!

08:10.991 --> 08:12.606
- Nadine!
- Nadine!

08:12.701 --> 08:13.907
Nadine.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.004
Nadine!

08:43.774 --> 08:44.934
Run!

09:56.513 --> 09:58.174
What was that thing?!

10:17.326 --> 10:18.315
No!

10:22.206 --> 10:24.447
We do not leave anyone behind!

10:34.092 --> 10:36.219
No! You don't go...

10:37.638 --> 10:39.549
...with the baby.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.714
No.

11:13.882 --> 11:14.917
What's wrong?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.245
- You!
- No!

15:19.336 --> 15:21.577
- You disappeared!
- No, please. Wait!

15:21.671 --> 15:23.627
You're sick, too! You're a carrier!

15:57.207 --> 15:59.038
Turn around slowly.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.804
- Jin?
- Sawyer?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.552
Jin!

16:18.603 --> 16:22.187
You're kidding me! You were on
that boat. I thought you were dead!

16:22.274 --> 16:24.515
No, l... in water.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.570
What do you say?

16:34.369 --> 16:35.734
Where is Sun?

16:43.837 --> 16:47.955
Where did that guy come from?
I thought he was on the boat.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.586
The blast must have
thrown him in the water.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.131
He's been moving with every flash,
just like us.

16:55.432 --> 17:00.267
Every time the sky lights up,
we... move through time.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.394
Translate!

17:08.028 --> 17:09.734
Please, translate.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.278
You heard the man, translate.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.237
He's Korean. I'm from Encino.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.293
He wants to know how you're sure
his wife is off the island.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.876
- You speak Korean, Red?
- Obviously.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.878
Tell him I'm sure.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.006
But none of it will matter
if we don't make it to The Orchid.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.203
Bring Sun back?

17:59.287 --> 18:01.664
Why you bring her back?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.490
Because she never should have left.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.759
I've spent the last
three years thinking...

18:21.101 --> 18:22.887
...believing that he was dead.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.978
You say you have proof he's not?
I want to see it.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.056
Put down the gun.
No one wants it to go off.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.936
How do you know he's alive?

18:35.407 --> 18:37.022
There's someone...

18:38.034 --> 18:40.571
...someone here in Los Angeles.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.277
Let me take you to them,

18:42.372 --> 18:45.409
- and I'll show you the proof.
- Someone? Who?

18:45.500 --> 18:49.118
The same person that's going to show us
how to get back to the island.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.794
Is that what this is about?

18:53.967 --> 18:58.631
You knew? You're pretending to care
about Aaron to convince me to go back?

18:58.722 --> 19:02.055
- I wasn't pretending anything.
- This is insane. You are crazy.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.928
- Kate...
- Jack! Don't.

19:07.731 --> 19:10.689
- Where are you going?
- I don't want any part of this.

19:10.775 --> 19:14.734
And if I see you... or him again,

19:14.821 --> 19:17.403
it will be extremely unpleasant
for all of us.

19:25.915 --> 19:30.158
Thirty minutes, Sun.
We can be there in 30 minutes.

19:30.253 --> 19:33.120
And you'll have proof.
Proof that he's alive.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.919
Or you can shoot me and never know.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.600
Let's go.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.352
How far?

19:58.406 --> 20:02.274
- Just over the next ridge.
- How you leave the island?

20:02.369 --> 20:04.735
- I'm not sure yet.
- I'll go with you.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.411
No, it doesn't work like that.
It's a one man job.

20:07.499 --> 20:10.536
- Why?
- I don't know why, Jin. ltjust is.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.868
But I promise, I'll bring Sun back.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.334
You OK? You want to take a break?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.583
Let's just get there.

20:22.097 --> 20:25.760
So... do you speak any other languages?

20:26.351 --> 20:27.887
Just Klingon.

20:29.813 --> 20:34.557
- Dan, is this going to work?
- It does make empirical sense that

20:34.651 --> 20:38.189
if this started at The Orchid,
that's where it's gotta stop.

20:38.279 --> 20:42.522
As far as bringing back the people
who left to stop these temporal shifts?

20:42.617 --> 20:44.733
That's where we leave science behind.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.738
You OK?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.490
Oh, no!

21:07.016 --> 21:08.096
Come on!

21:26.911 --> 21:28.367
Charlotte!

21:32.375 --> 21:34.366
- Charlotte...
- Juliet...

21:35.086 --> 21:37.327
You have a little...

21:39.924 --> 21:41.710
You too.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.923
Charlotte... can you hear me?

21:46.014 --> 21:49.848
Charlotte, it's Daniel. Talk to me...

22:00.904 --> 22:02.565
What'd she say?

22:02.655 --> 22:06.443
Don't let them bring her back.
No matter what.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.149
Don't let them bring her back.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.332
This place is death.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.386
You said we'd be there in 30 minutes.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.422
I didn't account for traffic.

22:44.656 --> 22:48.820
- Sun, I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

22:50.620 --> 22:52.235
For leaving Jin behind.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.822
When we landed that chopper
on the boat...

22:57.210 --> 22:59.747
...everything was
just happening so fast.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.704
I knew he was down below, but...

23:04.801 --> 23:06.792
We should've waited for him.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.010
Why are you telling me this now?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.800
Are you going to ask me not to kill Ben
if he's lying about my husband?

23:14.894 --> 23:18.807
After what he just did to Kate,
if you don't do it, Sun, lwill.

23:21.818 --> 23:25.231
- What are you doing?!
- What I'm doing is helping you.

23:25.321 --> 23:28.404
If you had any idea what
I've had to do to keep you safe,

23:28.491 --> 23:32.860
to keep your friends safe,
you'd never stop thanking me.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.288
You want to shoot me? Then shoot me.
But let's get on with it.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.038
What's it gonna be?

23:45.174 --> 23:46.550
Drive.

24:04.110 --> 24:08.103
- Why can't Daddy come with us?
- Charlotte, can you hear me?

24:08.906 --> 24:12.444
You know what my mum would say
about me marrying an American?

24:13.119 --> 24:17.158
I know more about ancient Carthage
than Hannibal himself.

24:18.791 --> 24:22.283
- What the hell is she talking about?
- l have no idea.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.209
Let's go. We have to keep moving.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.504
- Somebody help me carry her.
- No.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.127
She's going to hold us up.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.339
- We can't leave her.
- The flashes are closer together.

24:32.430 --> 24:35.718
When your nose starts bleeding,
you'll realize we gotta get out now.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.094
We'll come back for her
as soon as we can.

24:38.186 --> 24:41.428
No. No way.
I'm not gonna leave her behind.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.683
- Let them go without me.
- No, Charlotte.

24:43.775 --> 24:46.141
We're not gonna leave you behind.

24:52.367 --> 24:53.823
- The hell?
- We have to move!

24:53.910 --> 24:56.822
- He's right. Go. Just go!
- Charlotte...

24:56.913 --> 24:58.699
Charlotte...

24:58.790 --> 25:02.578
Turn it up, I love Geronimo Jackson.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.670
We're running out of time, Dan.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.416
Go.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.089
I'm gonna stay with her.

25:15.682 --> 25:19.095
Let me ask you something.
If we don't know when the hell we are,

25:19.185 --> 25:21.642
what happens if The Orchid ain't around?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.400
Look for the well.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.566
You'll find it at the well.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.941
We'll be sure and do that.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.357
Let's go.

26:15.700 --> 26:20.911
- We're here.
- Thank God.

26:20.997 --> 26:23.704
What are the odds we'd end up
in the same time as this?

26:36.137 --> 26:38.719
You just had to say something.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.675
How the hell did Charlotte know
this was here?

27:25.394 --> 27:27.009
- Daniel?
- Yes?

27:29.607 --> 27:31.347
I've been here before.

27:33.736 --> 27:36.398
You've been... here before?

27:36.489 --> 27:39.731
I grew up here on the island.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.868
There was this Dharma Initiative.

27:43.955 --> 27:46.947
And then I moved away with my mum.

27:48.042 --> 27:51.079
Just my mum.
I never saw my dad again.

27:52.588 --> 27:57.503
And when I got back to England,
I asked my mum about this place.

27:57.593 --> 28:01.006
But she would say that it wasn't real.
That I'd made it up.

28:02.682 --> 28:07.221
That's why I became an anthropologist.

28:07.979 --> 28:10.311
To find this island again.

28:11.274 --> 28:14.562
It's what I've been
searching for my whole life.

28:16.237 --> 28:17.727
Charlotte...

28:19.699 --> 28:21.439
...why are you telling me this?

28:25.162 --> 28:27.153
Because I remember something now.

28:28.624 --> 28:32.242
When I was little... living here...

28:34.380 --> 28:36.120
...there was this man.

28:36.966 --> 28:39.503
A crazy man. He really scared me.

28:39.594 --> 28:44.054
He told me I had to leave the island
and never, ever come back.

28:44.140 --> 28:49.680
He told me that ifl came back,
I would die.

28:52.273 --> 28:55.481
Charlotte... I don't understand.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.359
Daniel...

29:00.615 --> 29:02.196
...I think that man was you.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.415
You're going down there?

29:20.259 --> 29:23.797
- What exactly are you hoping to find?
- A way off the island.

29:24.597 --> 29:25.803
Expecting a subway?

29:27.725 --> 29:28.760
Goodbye, James.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.264
Juliet. Miles.

29:32.355 --> 29:35.267
- I'll see you when I get back.
- No. Stop.

29:35.358 --> 29:37.269
You don't bring Sun back.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.393
No, I have to bring them all back.

29:40.488 --> 29:42.854
- That's how it works.
- How you know?

29:44.742 --> 29:46.073
I just know.

29:47.870 --> 29:51.078
- I'll cut this.
- Do that, you'll kill every one of us.

29:51.165 --> 29:55.408
This island is bad.
You don't bring Sun back. Promise!

29:55.503 --> 29:58.961
- You promise you don't bring my baby!
- All right.

29:59.048 --> 30:00.504
You have my word.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.673
Promise... John.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.420
I promise.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.813
I won't go to Sun, Jin,
but she might find me.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.730
If she does, what do I tell her?

30:28.160 --> 30:30.947
You tell her I'm dead.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.905
You say I wash up.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.574
You bury me.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.171
Proof.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.140
I'll be back as soon as I can.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.455
Sure you don't want us
to lower you down?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.534
Where would be the fun in that?

31:21.505 --> 31:23.291
John...

31:23.382 --> 31:26.624
...if whatever you're attempting to do
actually works...

31:28.637 --> 31:30.138
Thank you.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.096
You're welcome.

32:22.525 --> 32:23.935
John! Damn it, hold on!

32:36.080 --> 32:38.537
I think you can let go of that now.

32:44.922 --> 32:45.957
No...

32:46.048 --> 32:49.336
- No! No! No!
- James, stop... James.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.553
- Stop.
- Come on, help me!

32:52.012 --> 32:53.548
James.

32:55.683 --> 32:57.389
We can't help him.

33:03.816 --> 33:06.057
Hold on. Hold on.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.479
Stay. Stay with me.

33:11.574 --> 33:15.613
Stay, OK? You're gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be OK.

33:15.703 --> 33:18.490
- No.
- We've got a plan.

33:18.581 --> 33:22.620
When we were back at the hatch,
I talked to Desmond.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.248
I told him to find my mother.

33:27.047 --> 33:30.210
She can help us, Charlotte.
She will help us.

33:30.301 --> 33:33.634
- How can your mother help us?
- She can.

33:41.395 --> 33:43.602
Listen, listen.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.349
What?

33:50.029 --> 33:52.862
I'm not allowed to have
chocolate before dinner.

33:59.997 --> 34:01.453
Charlotte?

34:03.250 --> 34:05.161
Charlotte?

34:10.966 --> 34:12.467
No.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.282
James!

34:44.083 --> 34:45.664
Can you hear me?!

34:48.045 --> 34:49.956
Can anyone hear me?!

34:58.138 --> 34:59.799
Who's there?

35:16.782 --> 35:17.771
Hello, John.

35:19.118 --> 35:20.324
You.

35:23.038 --> 35:25.450
What're you doing down here?

35:25.541 --> 35:27.873
I'm here to help you
the rest of the way.

35:32.548 --> 35:34.504
I don't understand.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.968
You came to see me in the cabin.

35:37.052 --> 35:40.715
You asked me how to save the island,
and I told you you had to move it.

35:42.016 --> 35:45.508
I said that you had to move it, John.

35:52.026 --> 35:54.358
But Ben said he knew how to do it.

35:54.445 --> 35:58.063
He told me that I had to stay here
and lead his people.

35:59.575 --> 36:03.409
And since when did listening to him
get you anywhere worth a damn?

36:09.918 --> 36:12.785
The good news is that
you're here now.

36:14.757 --> 36:16.122
You ready to go?

36:18.344 --> 36:21.928
I don't know what to do
once I get there.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.802
There's a woman living in Los Angeles.

36:25.893 --> 36:30.933
Once you get your friends, and it
must be all of them, everyone who left,

36:31.023 --> 36:34.311
and once you've
persuaded them to join you,

36:34.401 --> 36:38.861
this woman will tell you
exactly how to come back.

36:38.947 --> 36:43.737
- Who is she?
- Her name is Eloise Hawking.

36:44.578 --> 36:49.197
What if I can only convince
some of them to come back?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.701
I believe in you, John.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.619
You can do this.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.875
Richard said I was going to die.

37:03.514 --> 37:08.383
I suppose that's why
they call it sacrifice.

37:17.945 --> 37:20.687
All right. OK.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.734
All right, I'm ready.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.860
Good.

37:30.499 --> 37:35.835
Now... on the other side
of this column here,

37:35.921 --> 37:38.128
is a wheel that slipped off its axis.

37:38.215 --> 37:42.083
All you have to do
is give it a little push.

37:49.476 --> 37:50.761
Could you help me up?

37:52.646 --> 37:54.932
No. Sorry, I can't.

38:23.594 --> 38:25.209
God!

38:35.731 --> 38:37.346
Good luck, John.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.755
Say hello to my son.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.005
Who's your son?

39:41.338 --> 39:42.373
May I?

39:49.680 --> 39:51.136
Take it.

40:01.984 --> 40:04.691
- How do you have this?
- John gave it to me.

40:05.445 --> 40:07.401
You said John never came to see you.

40:07.489 --> 40:10.071
That's true, Jack.
I went to see him.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.071
Jin gave it to him
before he left the island.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.404
- Why didn't Locke tell me himself?
- I don't know.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.990
Maybe he never had a chance
before he died.

40:20.502 --> 40:23.084
I had to bring you here
before I gave it to you.

40:23.171 --> 40:28.416
All those people back on the island,
Jin included, need our help.

40:30.262 --> 40:34.505
There is a woman in this church. She can
tell us how to get back to your husband.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.682
But we're running out of time, Sun.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.051
So I need you to decide, right now...

40:39.980 --> 40:41.561
Will you come with me?

40:51.033 --> 40:52.523
Yes.

40:55.329 --> 40:57.570
What are you doing here?

41:08.508 --> 41:10.590
I assume the same thing you are.

41:12.095 --> 41:14.962
You're looking for
Faraday's mother, too?

41:38.372 --> 41:39.862
Hello, Eloise.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.090
Hello, Benjamin.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.390
I thought I said all of them.

42:01.103 --> 42:03.936
This is all I could get on short notice.

42:06.608 --> 42:10.066
VVeH,|suppose
it'll have to do for now.

42:14.032 --> 42:17.115
All right. Let's get started.
