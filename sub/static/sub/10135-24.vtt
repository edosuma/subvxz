Oh, so, Kimmy, what's

07:59.771 --> 08:03.024
going on for the weekend?

08:03.066 --> 08:06.820
(Kimmy)

08:03.066 --> 08:06.820
'Mom's got the roller derby

08:03.066 --> 08:06.820
championships, wanna go?'

08:06.861 --> 08:09.990
Oh, I just remembered

08:06.861 --> 08:09.990
what I wanted to tell you.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.700
Um, you know how Stephanie's

08:10.031 --> 08:12.700
always reading my diary

08:12.742 --> 08:14.702
and going through all my stuff?

08:14.744 --> 08:17.038
She's the queen of the sneaks.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.958
I've come up

08:17.080 --> 08:19.958
with the ultimate revenge.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.210
She won't know where,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.210
and she won't know how.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.130
But when she least

08:22.252 --> 08:25.130
expects it. Boom!

08:26.923 --> 08:29.134
'What's going on?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.134
What did she do?'

08:32.804 --> 08:34.222
No, Kimmy, I just said

08:32.804 --> 08:34.222
all that stuff

08:34.264 --> 08:37.100
because I'm gonna teach

08:34.264 --> 08:37.100
Stephanie a lesson.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.060
No, I don't need

08:37.142 --> 08:39.060
your mother's stun gun.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.899
I'll call you later.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.986
I'm dead, I'm dead,

08:44.941 --> 08:47.986
I'm dead. I'm dead.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.737
Oh, boy.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.656
Oh, no.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.201
- Hey, Steph.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.201
- Aah!

08:54.242 --> 08:56.619
What's wrong?

08:54.242 --> 08:56.619
You seem a little tense.

08:56.661 --> 09:00.081
Me? Nope.

08:56.661 --> 09:00.081
No tension here, huh.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.624
Cool as a cucumber.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.835
Oh, good. Well, do you

09:01.666 --> 09:03.835
wanna go up to my room?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.380
We can play that new

09:03.877 --> 09:06.380
computer game I got.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.466
Your room? Alone?

09:06.421 --> 09:09.466
No witnesses?

09:09.508 --> 09:11.385
I don't think so.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.345
Okay, well, I'll get you..

09:14.429 --> 09:15.680
Catch you later.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.268
I'm doomed.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.438
Superman!

09:23.480 --> 09:24.731
Whoo!

09:24.772 --> 09:26.983
Batman!

09:27.025 --> 09:29.694
Superman, Batman,

09:27.025 --> 09:29.694
your breakfast is ready.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.657
Thanks, Superman's mother.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.285
Your pancakes are delicious.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.953
Let's play wrestling now.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.374
I'm the Ultimate Warrior.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.625
[grunts]

09:45.293 --> 09:46.753
I'm the Macho Man.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.464
[grunts]

09:49.506 --> 09:52.884
Don't tell me,

09:49.506 --> 09:52.884
I'm the Macho Man's mother.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.137
You got it.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.265
[grunting]

09:59.682 --> 10:01.351
Freeze.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.104
It's my room

10:01.393 --> 10:04.104
and I say we play house.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.814
I love playing house.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.942
Playing house is for girls.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.902
I hate playing house.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.114
Let's play guns.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.699
Don't you listen?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.699
We're playin' house.

10:16.741 --> 10:21.204
Okay, let's play house and

10:16.741 --> 10:21.204
blow it up with our guns.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.998
Boom, boom, boom!

10:24.040 --> 10:26.543
Baby Love Button is not a gun.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.589
Come on, Teddy.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.589
Come over to my house.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.217
- I got phasers.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.217
- Cool.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.094
But what about Michelle?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.305
Yeah, what about Michelle?

10:38.346 --> 10:39.764
If you play with her

10:39.806 --> 10:42.517
I'll tell the whole school

10:39.806 --> 10:42.517
that you're a girl lover.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.145
I don't want that.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.521
Sorry, Michelle.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.317
Way to go, Teddy.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.943
Come on, let's be men.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.070
[grunting]

10:55.155 --> 10:57.991
I lost my best friend.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.118
[instrumental music]

11:04.956 --> 11:06.749
Okay. Now, Lumberjack Jess

11:04.956 --> 11:06.749
lives in the enchanted forest.

11:06.791 --> 11:07.834
Right.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.127
So he should be fun and magical.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.045
And bring joy

11:09.169 --> 11:11.045
to the children of the world.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.007
- Fun, magic and joy. Okay.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.007
- And have fun, have fun.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.592
- See, yeah, fun.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.592
- Yeah, yeah.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.594
Okay, Uh, uh..

11:17.636 --> 11:21.473
"Howdy ho, kids.

11:17.636 --> 11:21.473
I'm Lumberjack Jess.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.183
I'm Tinker Bell.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.183
Now I'm Tinker Bell.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.519
Well, I never said sprinkle

11:23.224 --> 11:25.519
fairy dust.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.188
Fun, magical and-and be manly.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.356
Strong, you know?

11:29.397 --> 11:30.857
What do you know

11:29.397 --> 11:30.857
about being manly?

11:30.898 --> 11:32.984
You still wear

11:30.898 --> 11:32.984
footsie pajamas.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.110
Hey, my feet get cold.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.778
Does that make me

11:34.152 --> 11:35.778
any less of a man?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.531
Yeah, it's not the footsies

11:35.820 --> 11:37.531
that bother me.

11:37.572 --> 11:38.739
It's that little

11:37.572 --> 11:38.739
trap door in the back

11:38.781 --> 11:40.783
with the missing button.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.327
Can I hang out with you guys?

11:42.369 --> 11:43.953
My friends went home.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.497
Oh, sure, Michelle.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.497
You can hang out.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.542
Lumberjack Jess here is learning

11:45.539 --> 11:48.542
how to be a real man.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.544
You could learn how to be a man?

11:50.585 --> 11:53.421
I gotta see this.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.756
Alright, you guys wanna see

11:53.463 --> 11:55.756
a manly character?

11:57.008 --> 11:58.218
- Watch this.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.218
- Okay.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.678
I'll show you

11:58.259 --> 11:59.678
a manly character.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.932
Hi, I'm Lumberjack Jess.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.477
I walk with a manly swagger.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.231
'Cause I have a manly job.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.940
I like to pull up

12:11.272 --> 12:12.940
my manly pants.

12:14.317 --> 12:15.860
Scratch my manly scratch.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.989
And when I see a friend, I like

12:17.404 --> 12:19.989
to give him a manly punch.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.199
Yo, Joseph.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.036
And then, I like to have

12:22.992 --> 12:25.036
a laugh at his expense.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.163
[laughs]

12:27.205 --> 12:28.707
I have a question.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.334
What makes boys different

12:28.747 --> 12:31.334
than girls?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.381
- Well, okay.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.381
- There's...boys.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.882
- Yeah, boys.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.882
- Girls and then..

12:37.924 --> 12:39.718
Well, take-take the birds

12:37.924 --> 12:39.718
and the bees for--

12:39.758 --> 12:42.178
- And Flowers.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.178
- Right, and flowers.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.222
- Yeah, you know--

12:42.220 --> 12:44.222
- Why don't you just tell her?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.307
Michelle, you know,

12:44.264 --> 12:46.307
a-a question like that

12:46.349 --> 12:48.851
can only be answered

12:46.349 --> 12:48.851
by a manly man.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.855
Take it, Jess.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.441
Ha ha ha!

12:57.652 --> 12:59.904
Alright, uh, so..

12:59.946 --> 13:01.698
...what you're asking is, uh

13:01.740 --> 13:03.199
what's the difference

13:01.740 --> 13:03.199
between, uh

13:03.241 --> 13:05.868
boys an-an-and girls, right?

13:05.910 --> 13:08.913
That's the question.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.913
What's the answer?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.164
Yeah, I figured you'd

13:08.955 --> 13:10.164
be asking that.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.541
Alright, well,

13:10.206 --> 13:11.541
uh, it's.. Okay..

13:11.583 --> 13:12.626
There's a lot

13:11.583 --> 13:12.626
of differences, uh

13:12.667 --> 13:14.335
for instance, uh, uh

13:14.377 --> 13:16.463
boys get to lead

13:14.377 --> 13:16.463
when you dance.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.548
Um, oh, uh, right.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.133
See boys can grow

13:18.590 --> 13:20.133
a little mustache

13:20.174 --> 13:21.718
and a little beard.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.720
And, oh, the best part is,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.720
the best part is

13:23.762 --> 13:25.221
at a concert or, say

13:25.263 --> 13:26.473
a ball game or somethin'?

13:26.514 --> 13:27.932
The lines at the men's room

13:27.974 --> 13:29.267
are so much shorter.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.396
Bein' a boy sounds like fun.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.064
Pff. It's the funnest.

13:35.106 --> 13:38.192
So, uh, does that

13:35.106 --> 13:38.192
answer your question?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.361
- Yes, it does.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.361
- Oh, thank God.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.824
- Stephanie.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.824
- Aah!

13:46.867 --> 13:47.910
I have something for you.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.995
I don't want it.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.413
Yes, you do. Here.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.124
What's wrong?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.793
It's your favorite dessert.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.836
A double fudge,

13:54.833 --> 13:57.836
chocolate homemade brownie.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.674
Just for you,

13:57.878 --> 14:00.674
my loving sister.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.342
I baked it myself.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.968
You want me to eat that?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.220
Sure.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.306
You mean, chew it up

14:06.262 --> 14:08.306
and swallow it

14:08.348 --> 14:10.642
and have it go

14:08.348 --> 14:10.642
through my bloodstream?

14:11.810 --> 14:13.227
Steph, you're acting

14:11.810 --> 14:13.227
like I'm trying

14:13.269 --> 14:15.396
to poison you or something.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.482
Try it.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.482
It's really good.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.109
Well, thank you, D.J.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.487
I'll just take this

14:20.151 --> 14:22.487
non-poisonous brownie

14:22.529 --> 14:25.615
and...throw it out

14:22.529 --> 14:25.615
in the backyard!

14:27.492 --> 14:30.119
Because I<i> know</i>

14:27.492 --> 14:30.119
you're out to get me.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.579
What are you talking about?

14:31.621 --> 14:33.914
I listened in

14:31.621 --> 14:33.914
on your phone call.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.126
Stephanie, I'm shocked.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.420
- What did you hear?

14:37.168 --> 14:39.420
- Your evil plot.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.842
But it's gonna take more

14:40.921 --> 14:43.842
than a brownie to do me in.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.511
I already did you in.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.722
Huh?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.850
I saw you eavesdropping

14:51.891 --> 14:53.560
so I made up all

14:51.891 --> 14:53.560
that revenge stuff

14:53.601 --> 14:55.603
just to drive you crazy.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.397
Well, it just so happens..

14:58.648 --> 14:59.940
...it worked.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.943
Well, I hope

15:01.359 --> 15:02.943
you learned your lesson.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.612
I sure did.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.448
Your personal life

15:04.654 --> 15:07.448
is your own business.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.992
And I'll never listen in

15:07.490 --> 15:09.992
on your phone calls again.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.786
Good.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.788
I'll just read about it

15:11.828 --> 15:13.788
in your diary.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.625
- What?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.625
- Oh, nothing.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.422
Come on in, kids.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.382
Hey, Michelle.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.092
Teddy and Aaron are here.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.802
Why are we here?

15:27.844 --> 15:30.971
Michelle said

15:27.844 --> 15:30.971
she had a big surprise for us.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.558
Oh, yeah.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.558
It better be good.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.608
Hey, Teddy.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.608
Yo, Aaron.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.986
Ha ha ha!

15:48.072 --> 15:50.909
Michelle, what are you doin'?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.535
I'm a boy now.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.414
Let's play guns.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.998
(together)

15:56.456 --> 15:57.998
Yeah.

15:59.459 --> 16:03.170
Last one up the stairs

15:59.459 --> 16:03.170
is a girl.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.589
- Whoa!

16:03.212 --> 16:04.589
- Bang! Bang!

16:06.340 --> 16:09.761
- Danny, what's going on?

16:06.340 --> 16:09.761
- 'Bang! Bang! Bang!'

16:09.803 --> 16:11.345
Michelle just said

16:09.803 --> 16:11.345
she's a boy.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.430
Oh, Danny, don't worry.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.473
When I was Michelle's age

16:13.514 --> 16:15.099
I was a real tomboy.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.976
Didn't you ever go through

16:15.141 --> 16:16.976
a phase like that?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.689
You know, uh, one Halloween

16:21.731 --> 16:24.442
I actually wanted

16:21.731 --> 16:24.442
to be Julie Andrews.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.111
That doesn't leave this room.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.572
No problem.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.699
(together)

16:29.614 --> 16:31.699
Bang, bang, bang!

16:32.784 --> 16:35.495
- I got you, Teddy!

16:32.784 --> 16:35.495
- Argh!

16:38.164 --> 16:39.624
Teddy, are you hurt?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.751
What are you doing?

16:41.793 --> 16:42.961
I'm being the nurse.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.880
This man has a serious owie.

16:45.922 --> 16:49.342
Hey, I thought you said

16:45.922 --> 16:49.342
you were a boy.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.552
So? A boy can be a nurse.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.473
Let's get out of here.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.473
She's not a real boy.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.018
I guess you're right.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.145
Nice try, Michelle.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.814
Hey, you kids having fun?

17:02.856 --> 17:05.525
- Bang! Bang!

17:02.856 --> 17:05.525
- Get the giant.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.026
(together)

17:05.566 --> 17:07.026
Bang, bang, bang.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.653
- I got you.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.653
- No.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.321
Lucky for me,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.321
I just sprayed myself

17:10.363 --> 17:12.782
with my anti-ray-gun repellent.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.326
You were right.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.326
He is strange.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.164
Michelle, I didn't mean

17:18.412 --> 17:20.164
to break up your game.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.249
I'm a crummy boy.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.462
That's 'cause you're a girl.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.088
Why you trying to be a boy?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.757
Because Teddy doesn't wanna

17:29.799 --> 17:32.385
play with girls anymore.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.555
Oh, so that's what's

17:32.426 --> 17:35.555
going on here.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.099
Look, sweetheart

17:39.141 --> 17:41.019
I know you feel bad

17:39.141 --> 17:41.019
about this

17:41.060 --> 17:42.478
but you gotta understand.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.938
Teddy is just

17:43.980 --> 17:45.940
going through

17:43.980 --> 17:45.940
a stage right now.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.901
What's a stage?

17:47.942 --> 17:49.861
Well, a stage is when

17:47.942 --> 17:49.861
you go through something.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
And then, eventually,

17:49.903 --> 17:52.030
you grow out of it.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.573
You once went through a stage

17:52.071 --> 17:53.573
where you didn't

17:53.614 --> 17:55.157
like chocolate cake.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.117
No way.

17:57.159 --> 18:01.163
It only lasted 10 minutes,

17:57.159 --> 18:01.163
but, uh, you get the idea.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.207
Teddy right now

18:01.205 --> 18:03.207
is going through his

18:03.249 --> 18:05.334
I don't wanna play

18:03.249 --> 18:05.334
with girls stage.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.879
I don't like this stage.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.923
Oh, I know.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.090
But don't you worry.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.341
Before you know it

18:12.383 --> 18:13.676
all the boys

18:12.383 --> 18:13.676
are gonna wanna play

18:13.718 --> 18:16.012
with you all the time.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.263
And that's when I

18:16.054 --> 18:17.263
go through my

18:17.304 --> 18:20.016
keep away from

18:17.304 --> 18:20.016
my daughter stage.

18:20.058 --> 18:23.352
I just want my best friend back.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.187
Sweetheart, if he's

18:23.394 --> 18:25.187
really your best friend

18:25.229 --> 18:27.189
he'll come back around.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.400
Because real friends

18:27.231 --> 18:29.400
like you for who you are.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.777
Who am I?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.528
Who are you?

18:32.570 --> 18:35.364
You are Michelle Tanner.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.952
You are one terrific person.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.704
You're sweet, you're funny.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.248
You're friendly, you're kind.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.919
Keep going.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.712
I could go on forever.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.256
You always do.

I am?

You just wanna play

No, I don't.
