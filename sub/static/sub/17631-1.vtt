'This is Cleopatra, the
fabulous queen of the Nile,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.665
'whose only resemblance to an iceberg

02:06.791 --> 02:09.414
'is that no more
than one tenth of her is visible.

02:09.541 --> 02:13.957
'While nine tenths, the better part
of her, is beneath the surface.

02:14.083 --> 02:18.124
'Fate has decreed that the mighty leader
of the Roman Empire and Cleopatra

02:18.250 --> 02:21.624
'should be flung together
into the melting pot of history.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.332
Aargh!

02:28.416 --> 02:32.290
'And this is the ancient British settlement
of Cockium inconnoviae.

02:32.416 --> 02:34.165
'Where lived the inventor of the device

02:34.291 --> 02:37.124
'that has brought to generations
of beautiful girls

02:37.250 --> 02:40.332
'the healthy exercise
known as "having to walk home".

02:42.875 --> 02:46.415
'As he worked at his wheels,
this simple Briton, Hengist Pod,

02:46.541 --> 02:49.999
'would listen to his wife telling him
what he should do with them.'

02:50.125 --> 02:52.915
Wheels, wheels, wheels,
that's all you everythink about.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.332
Doesn't matter about me, oh, no,

02:54.458 --> 02:56.999
nevermind about taking me out
for a bit of fun.

02:57.125 --> 03:00.249
It's all very well your sitting there
making perishing wheels,

03:00.375 --> 03:01.915
but what sort of life is it for me?

03:02.041 --> 03:04.790
Nothing but the same drear old round,
day in, day out.

03:04.916 --> 03:08.749
Stuck in this miserable hovel,
while you go your own sweet way.

03:08.875 --> 03:11.249
- Scraping and screwing?
- Scraping and screwing.

03:11.375 --> 03:14.540
Trying to keep a roof overymy head
with precious little help from you.

03:14.666 --> 03:17.707
- Fingers to the bone?
- Working my fingers to the bone.

03:17.833 --> 03:20.290
- Scrubbing and clearing up after you.
- Hot ash-pit?

03:20.416 --> 03:23.582
Slaving away overya hot ash-pit
morning, noon and night.

03:23.708 --> 03:26.624
Cooking meals that nobody appreciates,
and for what?

03:26.750 --> 03:29.957
- Insults and ingratitude?
- Insults and ingratitude.

03:30.083 --> 03:34.499
I've given you the best years of my life,
Hengist Pod, and do you care?

03:34.625 --> 03:36.374
- Not a jot.
- Not a jot, you don't.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.548
For all you care, I may
as well not be here.

03:38.572 --> 03:39.981
Well, my mother warned me.

03:40.083 --> 03:43.457
"You'll neveryget anywhere with him,"
she said. "He's a dreamer."

03:43.583 --> 03:46.749
Poor Mother.
I'm glad she's not here to see this.

03:48.208 --> 03:50.374
I'm glad she's not here as well,
the silly old...

03:50.500 --> 03:53.624
- What did you say?
- Is the tea ready?

04:05.041 --> 04:07.415
- Good day to you.
- Oh! Hello.

04:07.541 --> 04:10.582
I'm your new neighbour.
I've just moved into the next cave.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.457
We were gonna take that,

04:12.583 --> 04:14.874
but we didn't like
the idea of constant running water.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.790
- Isn't that an advantage?
- Not when it's running through the roof!

04:18.916 --> 04:21.999
Excuse me, but I was just admiring
that thing you're making.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.374
It's very good. What is it?

04:25.500 --> 04:28.665
Oh, it's a wheel. It's for going on a cart.

04:28.791 --> 04:31.707
Where I come from,
they have things to go on carts,

04:31.833 --> 04:33.582
but they're sort of round, like that.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.790
Yes, yes, yes. I know all about those.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.540
But the trouble with them is, you see,
that if you stop on a hill,

04:38.666 --> 04:40.040
they roll backwards.

04:41.125 --> 04:45.165
- This one won't, you see.
- Ah, but... but will it roll forwards?

04:45.291 --> 04:49.957
Obviously, if it can't roll backwards,
there's only one way left for it to go.

04:50.083 --> 04:53.082
And another thing. If you think
you're going to get away with...

04:53.208 --> 04:55.207
Oh! I beg your pardon.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.665
I didn't know we had company.

04:57.791 --> 04:59.790
This is our next-door neighbour, dear,
Mr um...

04:59.916 --> 05:01.749
Horsa. Son of Ethelred.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.457
Not Ethelred the Unready?

05:03.583 --> 05:06.124
No, my dad was always ready.
So my mum said!

05:06.250 --> 05:07.957
How do you do, Mr Horsa?

05:09.166 --> 05:10.707
Please excuse the way I look.

05:10.833 --> 05:13.915
I haven't had a chance to put on
a lick of woad this morning.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.499
Not at all. You look lovely.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.874
My name's Pod, Hengist Pod.
This is my wife Senna.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.874
Senna! Oh! That's a pretty...

05:21.000 --> 05:22.874
- Pretty what?
- Er, pretty name.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.040
It was, till I married somebody called Pod.

05:26.916 --> 05:29.290
I shall excuse my wife.
She's not quite herself.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.915
Her poor old mother
was eaten by a brontosaurus.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.249
- That was too bad.
- Yes, you're right.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.874
Brontosaurus died within the hour.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.374
- How much do you want for your wheel?
- I don't know. I've neverysold one before.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.332
- People don't like new ideas.
- I'll have it.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.540
Just the one?
What good would that be?

05:45.666 --> 05:48.124
- I'll show you.
- Yeah.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.957
Hey, what are you doing? Look!

05:53.083 --> 05:55.249
They support the rim.
It'll be no good without them.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.832
Watch.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.540
There we are. Makes a perfect frame.

06:01.666 --> 06:05.582
So it does, yes. But what's
that square opening in the middle for?

06:05.708 --> 06:11.165
It's just an idea I had for letting in more
light. I thought I'd call it... a win-dow.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.165
Win-dow.

06:13.291 --> 06:16.374
Oh! We can call that a win-dow-rim.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.249
Yeah. What about window frame?

06:20.375 --> 06:23.790
Oh, well, if you like. It's all the same.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.624
'And so the good people of Cockium

06:25.750 --> 06:27.874
'went about their verysimple business,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.874
'blissfully unaware
that only a few miles north of them,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.290
'the ground was shaking
to the inexorable tread

06:33.416 --> 06:35.290
'of Julius Caesar's conquering soldiers.'

06:35.416 --> 06:37.832
Sinister! Dexter! Sinister!
Dexter!

06:38.791 --> 06:43.082
'Their leader was Mark Antony,
Julius Caesar's greatest friend.'

06:43.208 --> 06:44.457
What a country!

06:44.583 --> 06:47.874
'A figure to strike awe into the hearts
of men and women,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.457
'for two different reasons.'

06:55.000 --> 06:59.249
'Meanwhile, still blissfully unaware
of the approach of the Roman legions,

06:59.375 --> 07:04.415
'the simple people of Cockium
continued with their verysimple lives.'

07:04.541 --> 07:07.707
There's no prettier sight
than a young couple courting.

07:07.833 --> 07:11.082
It makes you want to get your club out
and have a bash yourself.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.165
Was it like that with you and Senna?

07:13.291 --> 07:15.999
Sort of, except that she had the club!

07:16.125 --> 07:19.249
I had my eye on a mate in Bristol.
Gloria, her name was.

07:19.375 --> 07:22.249
Beautiful. Lovely long, strong hair.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.540
I could have dragged that girl anywhere.

07:24.666 --> 07:25.666
Well, why didn't you?

07:25.791 --> 07:28.540
The damned Romans invaded her
settlement. She was neveryseen again.

07:28.666 --> 07:31.290
If those rotten Romans come here, I'll...

07:31.416 --> 07:33.415
- The Romans are coming!
- I'll be off.

07:33.541 --> 07:36.332
No. Running will do you no good.
Where are they?

07:36.458 --> 07:38.517
They're just coming overythe hill,
thousands of 'em.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.207
Arm yourselves, men. Get your women
and children away to the hills.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.630
Go on, move!

07:43.654 --> 07:47.517
Do you mean to say
we're gonna fight them?

07:47.541 --> 07:49.354
If we can just hold them
up till we get word

07:49.378 --> 07:51.148
to Boadicea and her
army, there's a chance.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.499
- Can you run?
- Just what I wanted to do.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.499
She's camped at Carlisle.
Go like the devil.

07:55.625 --> 07:56.665
I'll take Senna.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.040
Neverymind about your wife.

07:58.064 --> 08:00.082
It's my two-wheeler.
I named it after her.

08:00.208 --> 08:02.457
- All right, but be quick.
- You can depend on me.

08:12.291 --> 08:15.457
Legion! Legion! Terminus!

08:16.541 --> 08:19.082
What's that settlement down there?

08:19.208 --> 08:21.332
We call it Cockium inconnoviae, General.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.415
What a mouthful. They deserve
to be done with a name like that.

08:24.541 --> 08:25.957
We could do with a few captives.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.290
They fetch 20 sesterces
a time back home.

08:28.416 --> 08:30.207
It'd be silly going back empty-handed.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.332
Right. Order the attack.

08:32.457 --> 08:35.289
Legion, incursamus!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.332
Ow!

09:11.375 --> 09:13.624
It's hard work
catching these damn Britons.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.415
- All right. On your way.
- All right.

09:16.541 --> 09:17.832
Don't give up hope, men.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.790
Remember,
Hengist is on his way to our army.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.832
Oh, gawd. Oh, gawd.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.165
Oh, no!

09:40.541 --> 09:43.165
Oh, gawd! Oh, gawd!

09:43.750 --> 09:48.707
Come on! Come on!
Pull him along there.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.832
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.207
Excuse me. Any chance of a lift?

09:55.333 --> 09:57.790
- Yes, mate. Hop in.
- Thank you. How far are you going?

09:57.916 --> 10:00.415
- Just to Rome.
- Oh, I see.

10:00.541 --> 10:04.332
Would you mind dropping me at Carlisle?
Our army's there and I've got to get help.

10:04.458 --> 10:08.082
You see...
the Romans are attacking our settlement.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.832
- You don't say?
- Yeah.

10:09.958 --> 10:12.374
- In that case, come on.
- Oh! Thank you.

10:18.458 --> 10:22.040
Oh! Well... What are
the chains for?

10:22.166 --> 10:24.457
Just to stop you
falling out of the cart, mate.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.124
Thank you verymuch.
That's verythoughtful of you.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.415
The pleasure is mine.

10:31.291 --> 10:34.082
Oh! You seem to be rather full up.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.128
I suppose I'd better
wait for the next one.

10:36.152 --> 10:39.332
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Get in there!

10:41.500 --> 10:42.749
Oh! Hello!

10:42.875 --> 10:45.207
Oh, you silly Pod!

10:45.333 --> 10:47.540
'Enthroned in his lush headquarters,

10:47.666 --> 10:51.332
'mighty Caesar sniffed the sweet smell
of success and eucalyptus.'

10:51.458 --> 10:52.957
Achoo!

10:58.625 --> 11:01.290
Oh, I do feel queer.

11:01.416 --> 11:05.207
'He was closely guarded as always
by the champion gladiator of Rome

11:05.333 --> 11:09.540
'and captain of the Praetorian guard,
the noble Bilious.'

11:09.666 --> 11:11.582
I beg your pardon, sir.

11:11.708 --> 11:15.165
Oh, it's not your fault, Bilious.
It's this wretched country.

11:15.291 --> 11:18.915
I haven't been right since we landed.
It's the water, you know.

11:19.041 --> 11:21.415
It's making veryirregular soldiers
of us all.

11:21.541 --> 11:25.624
Oh, I've neveryknown
such a cold, damp, depressing place.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.124
Achoo!

11:28.791 --> 11:30.707
Even my laurels have wilted.

11:30.833 --> 11:33.874
When I left Rome,
they were positively rigid.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.332
Here, my lord.
I've prepared this for your illness.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.207
Oh, yes, dear? What is it?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.415
It's an old British medicant,
my lord,

11:43.541 --> 11:46.499
made of mustard seed,
brewed up with bats' ears,

11:46.625 --> 11:49.874
seaweed
and the intestines of pregnant lizards.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.582
Yes. Charming.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.624
To be taken externally, I trust?

11:53.750 --> 11:57.457
Yes, my lord.
You just add a little to your foot bath.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.957
Like this.

12:02.958 --> 12:04.749
Oh!

12:04.875 --> 12:07.915
Oh, it's good. Yes. Ver good.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.249
Pretty little thing.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.415
- Where did we capture her?
- At the settlement they call Bristol, sir.

12:12.541 --> 12:16.207
Oh, yes! I might've guessed.
And what is your name, dear?

12:16.333 --> 12:18.374
They call me Gloria, my lord.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.665
Remind me to take her back to Rome
with me.

12:20.791 --> 12:23.374
I'd like to give my wife something useful
for a change.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.249
Useful, sir? To her?

12:25.375 --> 12:28.040
Fair's fair. The last thing she gave me
was some perfume.

12:28.166 --> 12:30.790
It sounds like one of our legions
is returning, sir.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.415
Legion, dismiss!

12:34.541 --> 12:36.726
The army from the south
with Mark Antony at their head.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.707
Oh, good! My friend.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.790
- Hail, Mark Antony!
- Hail.

12:43.916 --> 12:46.707
Snow. Sleet. Thunder. Lightning.
The lot. Julius in?

12:46.833 --> 12:48.290
Aargh!

12:49.750 --> 12:51.582
I see he is.

12:51.708 --> 12:52.976
It's all right for some people.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.582
I'm busy waging a war,
he's busy trying to make a piece!

12:57.625 --> 12:59.165
Mark Antony, sir.

13:00.125 --> 13:01.832
- Julie!
- Tony!

13:01.958 --> 13:05.290
- I've caught you with your toga up!
- I was just soaking my feet.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.874
I can't seem to get them warm.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.040
You've been wearing
open-toed sandals again.

13:10.166 --> 13:13.915
No, it's not that, it's this filthy disease
I've caught. Some local thing.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.290
It's called "a stinking cold".

13:16.416 --> 13:19.082
Neverymind. Carryy on. Don't mind me.
Get them in again.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.707
- Thank you.
- All right?

13:20.833 --> 13:24.582
Much better.
And how goes the conquest of Britain?

13:24.708 --> 13:26.790
I just don't get these Britons at all.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.790
Every time we get
a decent punch-up started,

13:28.916 --> 13:31.999
some geezer behind their line shouts,
"Tea up!" and they all disappear.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.624
"Tea up"? How veryodd.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.290
It must be one of these strange gods
they worship.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.790
Like this other one
they're always talking about, "Crumpet".

13:40.333 --> 13:43.582
- What's that again?
- Crump-et. I don't understand it at all.

13:43.708 --> 13:46.124
No. I don't think
they want to be conquered.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.999
I know what you mean. Apathetic.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.207
That's the word.

13:49.333 --> 13:52.457
We didn't have any trouble
in Spain and Gaul. We slayed 'em there.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.550
I don't know why we
bother with this lot.

13:54.574 --> 13:56.707
Look at these lovely
straight roads I built.

13:56.833 --> 13:58.915
They don't even bother to use them.

13:59.041 --> 14:01.540
Same with the baths.
This countr is a dead loss.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.957
It's always so cold and damp.

14:04.083 --> 14:08.457
You wouldn't think it, but this is supposed
to be "the season of the golden breezes"!

14:08.583 --> 14:10.874
More like the season
of the brazen monkeys.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.415
Excuse me, sir,
but a messenger is without.

14:13.541 --> 14:14.582
I'm not surprised.

14:14.708 --> 14:17.374
If we stay here much longer,
we'll all be without. Send him in.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.082
Enter.

14:19.958 --> 14:21.040
Hail, Caesar, hail!

14:21.166 --> 14:24.249
Oh, hail! My corn!

14:24.375 --> 14:26.101
- Hail!
- All right. We don't want all that.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.125
What is it?

14:27.250 --> 14:30.290
Mighty Caesar,
I have come hotfoot from Rome.

14:30.416 --> 14:34.332
I bring an important message
from your esteemed father-in-law Seneca.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.457
Oh! I wish he'd use a lighter notepaper!

14:38.583 --> 14:40.749
I'm terribly sorryy, my lord.
I didn't mean...

14:40.875 --> 14:43.540
Get out, you great steaming nit.
Go on, hop it.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.540
- Go on, Julie. Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

14:47.666 --> 14:49.082
Fool!

14:49.875 --> 14:52.707
- What does the old fool say?
- Hang on.

14:52.833 --> 14:55.374
It starts off, "Beware the ides of March."

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
What does that mean?

14:56.625 --> 14:59.707
Don't ask me.
He's always making some silly prediction.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.874
Last time it was,
"Beware the nuts in May."

15:03.000 --> 15:05.040
He's a nut if everyl saw one.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.915
Hello. This doesn't sound so good.

15:07.041 --> 15:10.832
"There is news from Egypt
that Ptolemy is trying to usurp Cleopatra."

15:10.958 --> 15:13.082
- Trying to do what with her?
- Usurp her.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.249
Sounds positively revolting.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.207
Who is this Cleopatra?

15:17.333 --> 15:20.374
That bird that rules Egypt.
She could cause us a lot of trouble.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.540
- Don't they all?
- Hey, listen. Listen to this.

15:23.666 --> 15:26.332
"The senate demands immediate action."

15:26.458 --> 15:29.707
"And there is a movement afoot to make
Brutus emperor in your absence."

15:29.833 --> 15:34.707
That plotter Brutus! He's always had
his eye on the emperor's throne!

15:34.833 --> 15:37.165
You won't let them
take it away from me, Tony.

15:37.291 --> 15:39.415
Julie, Julie, Julie. I'm your friend.

15:39.541 --> 15:40.599
You are my friend.

15:40.623 --> 15:43.767
I think we ought to get
back to Rome right away.

15:43.791 --> 15:48.707
Good idea. And if anyone but me is going
to be emperor, I'd like it to be you.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.957
I'll drink to that.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.999
'Two months later,
after an absence of three years,

16:01.125 --> 16:03.207
'Caesar
made a triumphant return to Rome.

16:03.333 --> 16:06.665
'Well, not completely triumphant,
perhaps.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.457
'Let's just say he had a small majority.'

16:09.583 --> 16:11.707
Hail, Caesar! Hail!

16:18.833 --> 16:21.290
Hail, Caesar, hail.

16:22.375 --> 16:25.082
Boo! Boo!

16:29.125 --> 16:31.934
I don't like the look of this mob.
Give them a bit of the old flannel.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.957
- Yes, I've got my flannel ones on.
- No, no. Make a speech. Win 'em over.

16:36.083 --> 16:38.665
- Well, if you think so.
- Yes. Go on.

16:40.416 --> 16:44.332
Friends, Romans...
Countrmen. I know!

16:44.458 --> 16:45.582
Well, get on with it, then.

16:45.708 --> 16:50.082
I have been away from you now
for three years.

16:50.208 --> 16:53.124
And it don't seem a day too long!

16:54.458 --> 16:59.832
During that time, friends,
I have taken Spain, I have taken Gaul,

16:59.958 --> 17:01.874
I have taken Germanica.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.707
What would you have me take next?

17:04.833 --> 17:06.540
A running jump!

17:08.290 --> 17:12.207
I want to thank you
for this wonderful welcome.

17:12.333 --> 17:16.332
Every time I return from an expedition,
I am struck...

17:16.458 --> 17:18.249
Boo!

17:18.375 --> 17:20.540
Again and again...

17:20.665 --> 17:22.749
Have you forgotten
what I've done for you?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.082
I've given you an empire,
I've given you prosperity...

17:26.208 --> 17:29.457
What about all my reforms?
I've cleaned up this city.

17:29.583 --> 17:35.165
Have you forgotten my slogan,
"Nihil expectore in omnibus"?

17:35.291 --> 17:37.290
"No spitting on the public transport."

17:38.958 --> 17:41.665
- That does it. Get inside.
- It's a disgrace!

17:44.750 --> 17:46.207
I'll do him one of these days.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.624
Charming.
What a welcome for a great emperor.

17:51.291 --> 17:52.624
How sickening.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.207
On the steps of my own palace, too.

17:55.333 --> 17:59.165
Oh, Plato... great
and learned scholar,

17:59.291 --> 18:03.124
that you should see me thus,
covered in... stains.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.415
Where is everbody?

18:05.541 --> 18:08.832
Where's Seneca? Where's Calpurnia?
They are usually here to greet me.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.790
Now, don't be silly, dear.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.165
Just take it in your hand.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.707
It won't bite.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.832
That's it.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.332
Now dip it in the ink.

18:22.458 --> 18:26.124
- Seneca, what are you doing?
- Eh? Oh, hello.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.082
I was just teaching her to write. Why?

18:28.208 --> 18:30.249
You might have welcomed me home.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.499
Oh! Have you been out, then?

18:32.625 --> 18:34.790
Out? I've only been
in Spain, Germany, Britain.

18:34.916 --> 18:38.374
Oh, yes, of course you have.
I forgot.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.749
- Where is Calpurnia?
- At her toilet.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.665
Ah. Where?

18:42.791 --> 18:44.165
In her bath.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.957
That's all right, then.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.707
Yoo-hoo, Calpurnia, sweetheart!
It's me, dear. I'm back.

18:49.833 --> 18:52.082
And about time, too.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.707
And where, may I ask,
have you been for the past three years?

18:55.833 --> 18:58.165
Oh, don't be like that, dear.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.124
You know perfectly well where I've been.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.290
- Where?
- I've been conquering.

19:02.416 --> 19:04.749
Hah! Conquering, you call it?

19:04.875 --> 19:07.749
Gallivanting around Europe
enjoying yourself more like!

19:07.875 --> 19:10.249
No. It was a purely business trip.

19:10.375 --> 19:13.832
Hannibal used to take his wife with him
on his business trips.

19:13.958 --> 19:18.374
Well, it was different for him.
He had all those elephants to help him.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.790
Anyway, it would have been
no fun for you, all that eternal fighting.

19:21.916 --> 19:24.415
Since when have you done any fighting?

19:24.541 --> 19:26.624
No, I meant if you'd come along too, dear.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.874
I know you, Julius Caesar.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.415
You'd do anything
rather than stay at home with me.

19:31.541 --> 19:34.582
Well, you won't be here much longer
for me to worr about.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.040
What do you mean by that?

19:36.541 --> 19:38.874
Seneca says
there's a bird of ill omen about.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.415
I've just seen him with her in the librar.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.374
Ah!

19:44.500 --> 19:46.040
Your days are numbered.

19:46.166 --> 19:49.457
Beware the ides of March!

19:49.583 --> 19:51.999
Oh, shut up, you silly old faggot.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.582
Don't you dare
speak to my daddy like that.

19:54.708 --> 19:56.374
Well, he gets on your nerves.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.540
I'm sorry, dear,
but I'm fed up with listening

19:58.666 --> 20:01.124
to all his visions and omens and stuff.

20:01.250 --> 20:05.082
Seneca is well known throughout Rome
as a truly great sage.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.207
Yes. And I know my onions.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.874
I wish you'd been in Britain,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.207
they know what to do
with sage and onions!

20:16.166 --> 20:19.874
Oh, my dear,
you've no idea how much I've missed you.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.040
Three years is a long time to go without.

20:23.166 --> 20:27.499
- Without what?
- Without the company of a beautiful wife.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.749
What about all those women abroad?

20:29.875 --> 20:32.874
There weren't any.
They don't have them abroad, you know.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.290
They're a very bashful people there.

20:35.416 --> 20:37.040
Really, Julius?

20:37.166 --> 20:38.874
Really, darling.

20:40.916 --> 20:43.415
Sir, what do you want done
with your woman here?

20:43.541 --> 20:45.332
What is that?

20:45.458 --> 20:48.249
It's just a little thing
I picked up in Britain.

20:48.375 --> 20:51.540
- It's for you.
- I don't want any of your pick-ups.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.375
I'll have her.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.790
No, you won't, you dirty old sage.

20:56.916 --> 21:00.165
Daddy, take me away from this...
this monster!

21:00.291 --> 21:01.374
Monster?

21:01.500 --> 21:04.749
How dare he insult me
by offering me this... this...

21:04.875 --> 21:07.165
I quite agree, daughter!

21:07.291 --> 21:08.874
She's no use to you.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.957
But don't you worr.
I'll think of something to do with her.

21:13.083 --> 21:16.790
But I've other gifts for you, dear.
I've onions from Spain.

21:16.916 --> 21:18.540
I've got some Spanish onions.

21:18.666 --> 21:20.374
Cheeses from Holland.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.207
I've got some Dutch cheeses.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.165
And stones from far-off Gaul.

21:25.291 --> 21:27.624
She's got gallstones an' all!

21:27.750 --> 21:29.374
I had no idea.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.082
This is a fine homecoming, I must say.

21:38.458 --> 21:42.040
Oh! They haven't even warmed the seat.

21:44.583 --> 21:48.499
'By now, the captives
from Britain had arrived in Rome.

21:48.625 --> 21:52.499
'Herded together in their little room,
they were learning to their dismay,

21:52.625 --> 21:53.957
'that this was one emergency

21:54.083 --> 21:56.790
'in which nothing happened
if you pulled your chain.'

21:56.916 --> 21:59.915
All right. If you don't want the goods,
stop messing them about.

22:00.041 --> 22:04.165
I'll tell you the truth. There's little
demand for this British stuff nowadays.

22:04.291 --> 22:07.082
- They don't make them like they used to.
- Look here, Marcus.

22:07.208 --> 22:10.915
No, I'm Spencius.
It's my brother what's Marcus.

22:11.041 --> 22:13.124
We're in partnership now, you know.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.040
Marcus and Spencius.

22:15.166 --> 22:18.165
- Here's my card.
- All right. Now, you know me.

22:18.291 --> 22:19.915
Did I everybring you any rubbish?

22:20.041 --> 22:21.684
I only bring you the best, you know that.

22:21.708 --> 22:25.290
- Look at them, all solid bone and muscle.
- Bone and muscle I've got plenty of.

22:25.416 --> 22:27.290
It's brains what people want.

22:27.416 --> 22:29.915
They've got brains.
Artisans, everyone of them.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.707
- What did you do in Britain?
- I was a wheel maker.

22:33.708 --> 22:35.124
See that, he makes wheels.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.332
- Square ones.
- Squ...?

22:39.083 --> 22:41.457
Neverymind him.
Here, you. What did you do?

22:41.583 --> 22:43.665
- I was a hunter.
- Hunter?

22:43.791 --> 22:46.749
Hunter. Now, what about that, then?
A hunter.

22:46.875 --> 22:48.665
What did you hunt?

22:48.791 --> 22:50.124
Romans.

22:52.666 --> 22:53.900
A fat lot of help you are.

22:53.924 --> 22:56.601
Look, General. I'll tell
you what I'll do with you.

22:56.625 --> 23:00.582
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you 150 sesterces for the lot.

23:00.708 --> 23:03.624
150 sesterces? Do me a favour.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.040
Do us a favour.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.165
You keep out of this.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.790
All right, 200 and they're yours.

23:10.916 --> 23:12.790
160. Not a sesterce more.

23:12.916 --> 23:15.207
160! What a liberty.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.707
That's daylight robber.
How can you stand there and...

23:21.083 --> 23:22.832
All right. 160.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.707
Providing you throw her in.

23:24.833 --> 23:28.582
Her? You don't want no more slaves,
General. You've got plenty.

23:28.708 --> 23:29.749
For working, yes.

23:29.875 --> 23:34.499
Yeah, but I mean, she's worth
40 sesterces to me, you know.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.665
She's a very good worker.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.332
She can cook... make clothes...

23:39.458 --> 23:41.040
wash... scrub...

23:41.625 --> 23:43.374
That's fine. I could use a good scrubber.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.749
All right. It's a deal.

23:44.875 --> 23:48.415
You're a good lad. Put my mark on her.
Send her round to my villa.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.082
Free deliveryhe wants.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.415
'While all this was going on,

23:55.541 --> 24:00.457
'Brutus was in the Senate indulging in
the grand old Roman game of mixing it.'

24:00.583 --> 24:03.582
And I warn you, members of the Senate,

24:03.708 --> 24:08.415
if we allow Caesar to go on like this,
the Roman Empire's finished.

24:08.541 --> 24:09.582
Hear hear!

24:09.708 --> 24:12.832
Already, gentlemen, we are in a decline.

24:12.958 --> 24:16.415
And I don't have to remind you
what that leads to.

24:16.541 --> 24:18.707
A fall.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.374
I'm so sorry.
Did I interrupt something?

24:21.500 --> 24:22.540
Hail, Caesar.

24:22.666 --> 24:24.582
Oh, likewise, I'm sure.

24:24.708 --> 24:28.040
I must warn you, Julius,
there is unrest in the Senate.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.790
There have been rumblings.

24:29.916 --> 24:33.415
- It's all that spaghetti they eat.
- Rumblings against you.

24:33.541 --> 24:37.082
They're concerned about affairs
in the east, Ptolemy and Cleopatra.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.415
Are they having an affair? Do tell.

24:39.541 --> 24:41.207
They're fighting for the throne of Egypt.

24:41.333 --> 24:44.374
If one of them can muster an army,
it'll be hard for Rome.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.915
They don't want to worr about that!

24:47.041 --> 24:50.249
Exactly. I've done my best
to reassure them.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.207
But perhaps a word from you?

24:52.333 --> 24:54.415
Of course. I'll give them a speech.

24:57.416 --> 25:00.999
Friends... Romans...

25:01.125 --> 25:03.082
- Countrmen.
- I know.

25:04.666 --> 25:08.999
I have been away from you now
for three years!

25:09.125 --> 25:10.874
Hooray!

25:11.500 --> 25:13.999
But now I am back!

25:14.125 --> 25:15.749
Boo!

25:16.166 --> 25:18.249
- How am I doing?
- They're right behind you.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.624
I thought so.

25:19.750 --> 25:24.457
With regard to the situation in Egypt,
I will tell you this,

25:24.583 --> 25:28.124
if Cleopatra and this other upstart...

25:28.250 --> 25:30.040
- Ptolemy.
- I am telling you!

25:30.166 --> 25:34.165
If these upstarts should prove a threat
to the Roman Empire

25:34.291 --> 25:37.040
I will not hesitate...

25:37.166 --> 25:40.540
nor notwithstanding...
anything to the contrar.

25:40.666 --> 25:45.582
I shall take steps...
now to give serious consideration...

25:45.708 --> 25:50.540
to the action, to be taken in the event
of events happening, notwithstanding...

25:50.666 --> 25:54.374
anything to the contrar.

25:54.500 --> 25:57.624
Please, show your approval
in the usual manner.

25:59.208 --> 26:00.582
You've neveryhad it so good!

26:03.500 --> 26:05.582
Stay there!

26:10.583 --> 26:12.290
Supermarket, innit?

26:15.291 --> 26:17.207
Look at that!

26:17.333 --> 26:19.124
"MA." What does that mean?

26:20.125 --> 26:22.249
Mark Antony. She's his.

26:25.708 --> 26:27.040
It could've been worse.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.207
How?

26:28.333 --> 26:30.082
Might've been Frank Antony.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.374
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.457
Citizens, today is your lucky day.

26:38.583 --> 26:43.749
It just so happens that I have been able
to procure at enormous expense

26:43.875 --> 26:48.874
a limited number of very top quality
Britons, all fresh in today! No rubbish.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.707
All right, you. Come on.

26:50.833 --> 26:52.540
- Where to?
- You're going for auction.

26:52.666 --> 26:54.832
Think of that. Me being knocked down.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.665
It's better than being knocked up!

26:57.791 --> 27:00.165
- Come on.
- Bring him in, Marcus.

27:00.291 --> 27:02.332
Coming, Spencius. Go on.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.957
How about that then, ladies?

27:06.083 --> 27:08.249
Isn't that a magnificent specimen?

27:08.375 --> 27:12.749
Phwoar! If that is not a veryhandy
little thing to have about the house,

27:12.875 --> 27:14.874
my name's not Spencius.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.582
Right, now. What am I bid?

27:16.708 --> 27:18.540
Ten.

27:18.666 --> 27:19.832
15.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.582
20.

27:22.708 --> 27:23.749
25.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.124
30.

27:26.458 --> 27:27.874
40.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.290
41? Yes?

27:30.416 --> 27:32.082
I'll pay you back.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.374
- All done at 40?
- No...

27:35.500 --> 27:37.999
Right. Sold to the lady
in the green schmutter.

27:38.125 --> 27:39.540
What's your name, darling?

27:39.666 --> 27:41.749
Willa Claudia.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.999
Willa Claudia. Mark him up, will you?

27:45.125 --> 27:46.457
Willa Clau...?

27:46.583 --> 27:48.540
WC? Oh, no!

27:48.666 --> 27:50.915
Please! WC!

27:54.166 --> 27:55.832
What happened?

28:00.208 --> 28:01.957
Ver funny. Ver funny.

28:02.541 --> 28:05.707
Do you know what? I think
they're making a convenience of you.

28:09.833 --> 28:12.540
Shouldn't worr about him.
He's doing all right.

28:12.666 --> 28:14.132
He's been bought by a woman.

28:14.156 --> 28:16.851
What's the benefit in
being bought by a woman?

28:16.875 --> 28:18.624
What do you think?

28:18.750 --> 28:20.749
Oh! Yeah, right.

28:20.875 --> 28:22.957
Lead me to 'em!

28:27.625 --> 28:31.707
All right there, citizens,
here is another of our special offers.

28:31.833 --> 28:33.707
Now then. What am I bid for this...

28:35.041 --> 28:36.665
for this er...

28:37.166 --> 28:38.290
For this?

28:38.416 --> 28:40.415
One at a time, please, ladies.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.624
Right. Now, come on.

28:43.750 --> 28:45.915
Who's going
to start the ball rolling, then?

28:47.333 --> 28:49.415
Did I hear five sesterces?

28:50.750 --> 28:52.082
No, I didn't.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.790
Don't worr.
They're just overawed at the moment.

28:54.916 --> 28:56.582
Get out of it.

28:56.708 --> 28:58.415
Who'll say three sesterces?

28:59.375 --> 29:01.499
- Two?
- One?

29:03.083 --> 29:04.540
Now, look here, citizens.

29:04.666 --> 29:06.290
I'll tell you what I'll do.

29:06.416 --> 29:09.290
With this special offer here,
I will throw in

29:09.416 --> 29:12.874
this beautiful plaster cast
of the goddess Aphrodite,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.332
absolutely free, gratis and for nothing.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.832
Right. No sale. Mark him up for the usual.

29:27.125 --> 29:28.374
How did you get on?

29:28.500 --> 29:32.415
I don't know. They just stamped me
with a little lion. Look.

29:32.541 --> 29:34.832
That means
you'll be going to the lions, mate.

29:34.958 --> 29:37.207
- I hope they're a nice family?
- You'll find out.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.332
Er, Hengist.

29:39.458 --> 29:42.624
What he means is, you're to be thrown
to the lions in the arena.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.207
- Those lions! No!
- Hengist!

29:45.333 --> 29:46.915
Well, it's quick, anyway.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.040
The old head in the mouth,

29:49.166 --> 29:51.374
quick snap of the old jaws
and it's all over.

29:51.500 --> 29:55.124
That's all verywell, but how
am I gonna get his head in my mouth?

29:55.583 --> 29:58.957
What about me? Do you fancy
being lumbered for the rest of your life

29:59.083 --> 30:01.457
as the pampered pet
of an old Roman bag?

30:01.583 --> 30:03.332
Quite frankly, yes.

30:03.458 --> 30:06.082
Well, I can't face it.
Let's make a break for it.

30:06.208 --> 30:09.082
- What, escape?
- Anything's better than this.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.707
Get behind the doorway and when
the guard comes in, trip him up.

30:14.166 --> 30:16.915
All Romans are idiots!
They know absolutely...

30:18.125 --> 30:20.124
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.290
- Thank you verymuch.
- Not at all.

30:23.416 --> 30:24.915
Come on!

30:25.041 --> 30:27.957
Now, I'm not here today
and gone tomorrow.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.624
I won't be here this afternoon.

30:30.458 --> 30:31.624
What a day!

30:31.750 --> 30:36.749
Pelted by the populace, sat on
by the Senate, spat at by my spouse.

30:36.875 --> 30:39.665
Honestly,
I don't know why I bother being emperor.

30:39.791 --> 30:42.624
- Why do you?
- Don't be silly. What else could I do?

30:42.750 --> 30:45.374
At school,
I didn't even get my X-oneplus.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.332
You could be a public orator.

30:47.458 --> 30:51.457
Public oratory?
Oh, no, it's an unspeakable business.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.582
I hear some slaves
escaped from the market today.

30:54.708 --> 30:57.707
That's all I needed.
What have I done to deserve all this?

30:57.833 --> 31:00.040
Have I displeased the gods
in some manner?

31:00.166 --> 31:04.040
O, dark, invidious muse
that blights my life!

31:04.166 --> 31:07.207
Come, show your fearful, haggish face!

31:07.333 --> 31:09.790
- Yes?
- Not you. What do you want?

31:09.916 --> 31:13.040
Well, I thought you'd like to know.
There's another strike on.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.624
Not another one? Who is it this time?

31:15.750 --> 31:17.999
- The eunuchs.
- The eunuchs?

31:18.125 --> 31:19.999
For heaven's sake,
what are they striking for?

31:20.125 --> 31:22.499
They're complaining about loss of assets.

31:25.666 --> 31:26.957
- Hail, Bilious.
- Hail, Antony.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.249
I want to see the boss.

31:30.291 --> 31:31.832
Mark Antony, sir.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.457
At last we'll hear something cheerful
for a change.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.707
My friend!

31:36.833 --> 31:39.915
- You're right in it this time.
- Oh, no. What's happened now?

31:40.041 --> 31:44.124
News from Egypt. Ptolemy has mustered
an army and is marching on Alexandria.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.249
What about Cleopatra? Is she mustered?

31:46.958 --> 31:48.540
Well, I have heard a couple of stories.

31:48.666 --> 31:51.332
No, I mean, has she mustered an army?

31:51.458 --> 31:53.457
Oh. Yes, I believe she has.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.415
We've got to do something
about that lot.

31:55.541 --> 31:56.874
But what do we do?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.707
Do we support Ptolemy
and defeat Cleopatra

31:59.833 --> 32:01.040
or vice versa?

32:01.166 --> 32:03.707
Well, if you're bringing vice into it,
I prefer Cleopatra.

32:03.833 --> 32:06.790
If only we knew
what was happening out there.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.207
What on earth is going on?

32:10.333 --> 32:13.249
It's Daddy.
He's having one of his visions.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.082
Good. Now perhaps he'll be able
to tell us something.

32:31.708 --> 32:32.999
Oh! Hello!

32:33.125 --> 32:37.165
- Well? Did you see anything?
- Oh, yes. And it was lovely.

32:37.291 --> 32:38.790
There was this room, you see,

32:38.916 --> 32:41.124
and it was full with lovely girls
all lying about

32:41.250 --> 32:42.790
in things you could see right through.

32:42.916 --> 32:45.415
Daddy, dear.
You've been eating cheese again.

32:45.541 --> 32:46.790
Daughter dear, no, I haven't.

32:46.916 --> 32:49.832
And then Caesar came in,
and there was a lot of soldiers.

32:49.958 --> 32:51.749
What happened to me?

32:51.875 --> 32:54.124
I don't remember.
I was busy looking at the girls.

32:54.875 --> 32:56.264
Blimey, this is a waste of time.

32:56.288 --> 32:58.491
If you want to find out
what is going to happen,

32:58.515 --> 33:00.267
you have to consult
the vestal virgins.

33:00.291 --> 33:03.999
- Of course! The temple of Vesta!
- I say! Can I come too?

33:04.125 --> 33:08.165
- Certainly not!
- I thought it would make a nice change.

33:08.291 --> 33:11.332
That's one place
we don't want any changes, thank you.

33:11.458 --> 33:14.332
You might have already got some,
with the eunuchs on strike.

33:14.458 --> 33:18.582
Oh, don't say that. I want them
to augur something really nice for me.

33:18.708 --> 33:22.499
You'd better hurr up. They'll soon
be shouting "Last augurs, please!"

33:24.833 --> 33:26.499
Uh-oh! Dead end!

33:26.625 --> 33:28.374
I can hear them coming. We're done for.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.415
No, we're not. Come on. In here.

33:37.375 --> 33:38.957
- Cor!
- Shh!

33:39.083 --> 33:40.582
Look at that!

33:40.708 --> 33:42.707
Look! Look!

33:43.583 --> 33:44.915
Hey, there's a door.

33:46.875 --> 33:51.540
"Strictly no admittance.
Vestal virgins and eunuchs only."

33:51.666 --> 33:53.915
- What are we?
- Well, you should know.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.707
They must be somewhere around.

34:00.833 --> 34:04.582
We'll have to chance it. If anyone asks
who we are, say we're eunuchs.

34:05.083 --> 34:07.707
Eh? Oh, yeah.
What have we got to lose?

34:22.291 --> 34:23.956
Cor!

34:26.750 --> 34:29.081
Hey! We're in the ladies'!

34:43.541 --> 34:44.706
No, you fool!

34:44.833 --> 34:48.331
Don't you know it's immediate death
for anyone who goes in there?

34:51.583 --> 34:53.331
Ho within! It's the city guard.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.540
Open up, please.

34:57.458 --> 35:00.124
Oh. That's all right.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

35:02.708 --> 35:03.957
It's all right. They've gone.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.333
Thanks.

35:05.458 --> 35:08.290
Yes. I don't know
what we'd have done without you.

35:08.416 --> 35:11.249
I don't know
what we could have done without you.

35:13.333 --> 35:17.832
? Whereveryl wander

35:17.958 --> 35:22.915
? There's no place like Rome.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.499
More wine!

35:26.625 --> 35:28.665
More vino. Come along, girl.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.540
Ah, there she is.

35:32.666 --> 35:34.832
Why don't you come on in?
The water's lovely.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.665
No, thank you, my lord.

35:36.791 --> 35:39.124
Go on, girl. I'll let
you play with my duck.

35:39.250 --> 35:40.499
Oh!

35:43.875 --> 35:45.790
Hey, Seneca. Where's Caesar?

35:45.916 --> 35:49.832
Oh, he's gone to convulse
the Vestal Virgins.

35:49.958 --> 35:52.457
- Consult.
- You're quite right.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.499
Neverymind. I'll find him later.

35:54.625 --> 35:57.832
- Oh, no, you won't.
- What does that mean?

35:57.958 --> 36:01.207
That vision, and those girls.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.124
That was the Vestals.

36:03.250 --> 36:06.499
And what's more,
I can remember what happened.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.082
- What happened?
- He was done.

36:08.208 --> 36:11.290
What? He had Bilious
and the guards with him.

36:11.416 --> 36:12.726
Nobody could have got near him.

36:12.750 --> 36:15.165
Aha! That's just it.

36:15.291 --> 36:17.040
It was them who did it.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.249
Blimus!

36:39.583 --> 36:40.749
Horsa...

36:41.750 --> 36:42.999
Mm-hm?

36:43.125 --> 36:46.415
Don't you think it's about time
we should be getting along?

36:46.541 --> 36:48.749
Oh, yes. Yes.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.665
Well, there's no point
in taking unnecessar risks.

36:52.666 --> 36:54.707
No. No, of course not.

36:56.833 --> 37:00.124
Perhaps we'd better just stay here
a little while longer.

37:00.250 --> 37:04.374
Yeah... Just a couple
of months or so.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.457
? Fanfare.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.790
Aarrgh!

37:11.916 --> 37:13.249
What's happening?

37:13.375 --> 37:15.374
- Sir!
- Get me out of here.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.544
It's a disgrace! There must be a
more comfortable way to travel.

37:18.568 --> 37:21.726
I'm sorry, sir, it was a low arch.
There wasn't a warning sign.

37:21.750 --> 37:23.582
Who holds the office
of traffic commissioner?

37:23.708 --> 37:24.767
You do, sir.

37:24.791 --> 37:27.874
Well, in future watch where you're going.
Are we there?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.457
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Come in with me and stay close.

37:30.583 --> 37:34.082
- I don't feel safe tonight.
- You're not.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.415
Guard the door. Let no-one enter.

37:41.833 --> 37:45.915
Wise daughters of the goddess Vesta,
grant me an augur!

37:46.041 --> 37:48.832
Who is it that craves our advice
at this hour?

37:48.958 --> 37:53.707
It is I, Caesar, grandson of Venus
and Anchises, your divine emperor.

37:53.833 --> 37:55.665
Caesar! We shall all die for this.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.624
Open up, I say! Or must I enter?

37:59.750 --> 38:03.457
- Yes?
- Oh, good evening. I wanted to ask...

38:03.583 --> 38:05.665
Are you really a Vestal Virgin?

38:05.791 --> 38:08.374
Oh, no. No, I'm a eunuch.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.790
Oh, I see.

38:10.916 --> 38:11.916
You're a what?

38:12.041 --> 38:16.790
I'm sorry. Vestal Virgins are off tonight.

38:16.916 --> 38:20.082
Are my senses deserting me?
There's something funny going on here.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.832
Bilious, l...
What are you doing with your thing?

38:22.958 --> 38:25.207
I'm sorry, sir.
But for the good of Rome, you must die.

38:25.333 --> 38:28.749
But you're my personal bodyguard!
I don't want to die.

38:28.875 --> 38:31.499
I may not be a verygood live emperor,
but I'd be a worse one dead!

38:31.625 --> 38:35.082
Treacher! Infamy! Infamy!

38:35.208 --> 38:36.915
They've all got it in-for-me!

38:40.500 --> 38:42.332
Aargh!

38:48.541 --> 38:50.499
Take this. Catch!

39:50.541 --> 39:52.374
In here. Quick!

40:01.500 --> 40:03.332
Ah! More of you, eh?

40:04.083 --> 40:05.540
Right. Come on.

40:10.791 --> 40:12.874
What a carveup!

40:24.583 --> 40:26.832
Well, he can't say I didn't warn him.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.332
If I've said it once,
I've said it a thousand times.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.749
"Beware the ides of March," I said.

40:31.875 --> 40:34.082
But it's not March. It's Januar.

40:34.208 --> 40:37.124
Yes, but an idiot like him
wouldn't know that.

40:37.250 --> 40:39.624
My poor dear husband! Is he dead?

40:39.750 --> 40:42.290
It's difficult to tell.
He always looks the same to me.

40:42.416 --> 40:45.665
- He looks a little wan.
- He looks a big one if you ask me!

40:45.791 --> 40:47.790
Speak to me, Julius!

40:47.916 --> 40:49.540
Speak to me!

40:49.666 --> 40:52.624
I hear a night owl screeching.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.457
It is I, Julius.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.290
Your wife Calpurnia.

40:56.416 --> 40:59.749
Oh, yes. I grow weak, dear.

40:59.875 --> 41:02.582
Draw near and lend me your ear.

41:02.708 --> 41:04.499
Don't. You'll neveryget it back.

41:05.041 --> 41:07.832
Yes, Julius, dear.
Did you wish to say something?

41:07.958 --> 41:12.957
I cannot go without saying something
for posterity.

41:13.083 --> 41:14.832
No, dear. Of course you cannot.

41:14.958 --> 41:18.582
Then let our posteriors know this.

41:18.708 --> 41:21.499
- Yes, Julius?
- My farewell speech.

41:21.625 --> 41:26.415
Friends, Romans...
Countrmen. I know!

41:26.541 --> 41:29.415
My last immortal words are...

41:29.541 --> 41:32.832
Veni, vidi, vici.

41:32.958 --> 41:36.457
I came, I saw, l...

41:38.000 --> 41:39.457
I conked out.

41:39.583 --> 41:41.874
Oh! He's gone.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.249
Oh, woe is me!

41:44.375 --> 41:47.999
Could I but tell him how sorry I am
for the way I've treated him,

41:48.125 --> 41:50.665
how much I loved him!

41:52.708 --> 41:54.249
Hello. What's going on?

41:54.375 --> 41:56.915
The mighty and noble Caesar is no more.

41:57.041 --> 42:00.124
Shut up. They haven't even touched him.
He's fainted, that's all.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.915
You little squirt!

42:02.041 --> 42:04.874
They wanted to kill me.
And it's the thought that counts.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.832
- Come, Daddy.
- Gladly.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.790
Oh, but, Calpurnia...

42:08.916 --> 42:10.540
They'd have got you all right,

42:10.666 --> 42:12.624
if that slave hadn't been there
to slay 'em all.

42:12.750 --> 42:14.999
What slay you... what say you?

42:15.125 --> 42:17.082
It's incredible.
But do you know that he beat

42:17.208 --> 42:19.915
the five top gladiators of Rome
singlehanded?

42:20.041 --> 42:22.832
Where is he? I must meet this superman.

42:22.958 --> 42:25.540
Guards! Bring in the prisoner!

42:25.666 --> 42:27.165
- Is that him?
- That's him.

42:27.291 --> 42:29.290
Are they holding him
the right way up?

42:29.416 --> 42:31.665
Bilious and the others were all slain

42:31.791 --> 42:34.017
and that little runt was there
with a sword in his hand!

42:34.041 --> 42:37.582
- He alone?
- No. Please, there's been a mistake, sir.

42:37.708 --> 42:40.332
You're dead right, mate, and you made it.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.582
Let's see how you go
against the lions in the arena!

42:42.708 --> 42:46.082
Oh, no! Please, sir!
I plead for mercy! I plead for my life!

42:46.208 --> 42:48.665
I plead for forgiveness.

42:48.791 --> 42:52.207
You miserable little pleader!
Take him away!

42:52.333 --> 42:54.707
No, no, wait. What is your name, slave?

42:54.833 --> 42:57.915
Pod, sir. Hengist Pod.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.957
Arise, Centurion Pod.

43:01.083 --> 43:02.249
Eh?

43:02.375 --> 43:04.499
Are you kidding?
That man's a menace!

43:04.625 --> 43:06.374
Exactly. And with him beside me,

43:06.500 --> 43:09.832
no-one will dare
make an attempt on my life again.

43:09.958 --> 43:11.582
You are impregnable, aren't you?

43:11.708 --> 43:14.415
No, sir. It's just that Senna
didn't want any kids.

43:14.541 --> 43:16.082
Listen to me, Hengist Pod,

43:16.208 --> 43:20.165
I hereby appoint you
commander of the Praetorian Guard,

43:20.291 --> 43:24.582
protector imperatori,
champion gladiator of Rome,

43:24.708 --> 43:29.665
honorar member of the Senate
and custodian of the imperial chambers.

43:29.791 --> 43:32.165
What did all that mean?

43:32.291 --> 43:35.207
That means that he has gone potty!

43:35.333 --> 43:37.415
'And that is how a simple Briton

43:37.541 --> 43:40.249
'who had never
so much as hurt a prehistoric fly,

43:40.375 --> 43:44.665
'became overnight the most feared
and admired man in Rome.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.582
'Everytime he appeared in public

43:46.708 --> 43:49.124
'the crowds clamoured
for his autograph and souvenirs.'

44:09.083 --> 44:12.165
'in his task of protecting
the imperial body of Caesar,

44:12.291 --> 44:14.249
'Hengist proved an effective deterrent.'

44:14.375 --> 44:18.582
All those in favour... No!

44:20.250 --> 44:22.665
I'm sorry, gentleman,
what was that vote again?

44:22.791 --> 44:24.790
Yes!

44:24.916 --> 44:28.124
Thank you, gentlemen,
I thought that was what you said.

44:28.875 --> 44:32.165
'Yes, being
Caesar's bodyguard was a full-time job.

44:32.291 --> 44:35.915
'Only when night came
could Hengist really relax.'

44:40.708 --> 44:42.790
Good night! Good luck!

44:42.916 --> 44:44.999
- What did you say, Julius?
- Good night.

44:46.541 --> 44:48.165
Good night.

44:51.833 --> 44:54.290
'At this time,
Mark Antony was arriving at Alexandria

44:54.416 --> 44:57.082
'at the head of another Roman legion.

44:57.208 --> 45:00.124
'He carried with him
express orders from Caesar

45:00.250 --> 45:04.499
'to remove Cleopatra from the throne
of Egypt and give it to Ptolemy.

45:05.041 --> 45:08.457
'Some hope. It was like asking your wife
to give up her mink coat,

45:08.583 --> 45:10.832
'because your girlfriend
is sitting in a draught.'

45:10.958 --> 45:12.332
Can I help you, gentlemen?

45:12.458 --> 45:14.457
Yeah. We want to see Cleopatra.
Who are you?

45:14.583 --> 45:16.707
I am her chief councillor Archimedes.

45:16.833 --> 45:20.207
- Get away. All right, take us to her.
- The Queen is at her toilet.

45:20.333 --> 45:22.457
Oh. Well, we'll wait, then.

45:22.583 --> 45:25.665
Then I will inform Her Majesty
of your arrival.

45:25.791 --> 45:27.082
Thank you.

45:28.916 --> 45:32.207
Right. Now, when we see her,
no messing about. She has got to go.

45:32.333 --> 45:34.207
And if she won't go quietly...

45:35.000 --> 45:38.582
Sir, I've no stomach for this sort of
thing. I've neverymade war on women.

45:38.708 --> 45:42.499
Then it's high time you started, mate.
They're a dead menace.

45:42.625 --> 45:44.332
Any time there's any kind of trouble,

45:44.458 --> 45:47.499
you can bet your bottom sesterce
there's a woman behind it.

45:47.625 --> 45:51.207
- I still don't like it.
- You're too soft. Just leave it to me.

45:51.333 --> 45:53.707
I know how to handle
this ambitious battleaxe.

45:53.833 --> 45:55.999
She's too big for her boots,
that's her trouble.

45:57.458 --> 46:00.665
The Queen will see you now.
Follow me, gentlemen.

46:06.166 --> 46:08.249
In here, gentlemen, please.

46:09.750 --> 46:12.749
All right, I'll come straight to the point.
Miss, I... You...

46:12.875 --> 46:14.040
Yes?

46:15.875 --> 46:17.957
Is there something I can do for you?

46:21.541 --> 46:23.540
Go on. Tell her.

46:25.958 --> 46:28.457
You know.
She's getting too big for her boots.

46:29.416 --> 46:30.624
Boots? What boots?

46:31.208 --> 46:33.707
- I don't see any boots.
- Caesar's orders.

46:33.833 --> 46:35.832
She's got to go.

46:35.958 --> 46:37.957
- Go?
- Yeah.

46:38.375 --> 46:40.624
- Got to go.
- Oh, well. Goodbye.

46:40.750 --> 46:42.082
Not me. Her.

46:42.208 --> 46:43.957
Eh? Oh, yes.

46:44.083 --> 46:46.874
Yes. Now look, I'm verysorry, miss.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.499
But I've had my orders. Madam, l...

46:53.125 --> 46:58.124
Don't apologise, please. I could forgive
such a handsome visitor anything.

47:00.666 --> 47:02.832
What handsome visitor?

47:02.958 --> 47:04.207
Oh, me!

47:04.333 --> 47:07.082
I thought you said
you knew how to handle women.

47:07.208 --> 47:08.999
Well, I do. It's all right.

47:09.125 --> 47:12.415
Now look here, miss, I have come
from Rome at Caesar's express bidding

47:12.541 --> 47:14.082
to get...

47:14.708 --> 47:17.707
Just one moment.
If you're going to get cross with me,

47:17.833 --> 47:19.290
I'll just get out of my bath

47:19.416 --> 47:22.290
and slip into something a little
more comfortable, if you don't mind.

47:35.083 --> 47:41.165
You were saying?

47:41.291 --> 47:43.707
'But Cleo knew
that as Queen of Egypt,

47:43.833 --> 47:47.582
'she could offer favours that a Roman
general would find hard to refuse.

47:47.708 --> 47:48.999
'And she knew too

47:49.125 --> 47:52.290
'that such favours as the powerful
Ptolemy might have to offer,

47:52.416 --> 47:54.082
'he could stick in his ear hole.'

47:54.208 --> 47:56.082
Cleo!

47:56.208 --> 47:57.665
Mark, you're back!

47:57.791 --> 47:59.665
- And have I got good news for you.
- What?

47:59.791 --> 48:02.624
Ptolemy's head, it's fallen. In the dust.

48:02.750 --> 48:04.499
- But how?
- I cut it off.

48:04.625 --> 48:06.540
Thank you! It's just what I always wanted.

48:07.250 --> 48:09.874
Now I'm the undisputed queen
of all Egypt.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.499
Do you know, I feel
I ought to give you something in return.

48:13.541 --> 48:15.790
Yes, but not in front
of all the handmaidens.

48:15.916 --> 48:17.915
No, no, no.

48:18.708 --> 48:24.749
There. Now, come and sit beside me.

48:24.875 --> 48:26.999
Do we have to have him
hanging around all the time?

48:27.125 --> 48:30.874
Sosages? He's my bodyguard.
He neveryleaves my side.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.832
Yes, I know, but I don't like sausages,
especially overcooked.

48:34.958 --> 48:38.957
There's nothing to fear, lover.
He's a mute. And he cannot talk either.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.082
No, but he can watch, can't he?

48:42.666 --> 48:44.624
Just to please you.

48:44.750 --> 48:46.415
Sosages, you may leave us.

48:54.250 --> 48:56.249
Now then, that's better!

48:58.708 --> 49:00.290
You sure that's dead?

49:00.416 --> 49:03.290
- Do you know, lover, I've been thinking...
- Me, too.

49:03.416 --> 49:06.665
I've been thinking about all the things
you and I could do together...

49:06.791 --> 49:09.207
- That makes two of us!
- If only you were emperor!

49:09.333 --> 49:11.915
Yeah, but I'm not.
So just do with me as I am.

49:12.041 --> 49:13.832
No, no, no, but you could be.

49:13.958 --> 49:16.249
Supposing Caesar were to die suddenly.
Couldn't you?

49:16.375 --> 49:18.309
You've got Ptolemy's head.
What more do you want?

49:18.333 --> 49:21.999
We have an old saying in Egypt.
"Two heads are better than one."

49:22.166 --> 49:25.082
But you don't know what you're asking.
Caesar is my friend.

49:25.208 --> 49:27.249
But it's such a little thing to ask for.

49:27.375 --> 49:29.832
That's just it, it's not a little thing.
He's a big head.

49:29.958 --> 49:33.249
You've disappointed me.
I thought that you were a real man.

49:34.041 --> 49:35.290
I am.

49:35.416 --> 49:36.499
Then prove it.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.624
That's what I've been trying to do.

49:38.750 --> 49:40.665
No, no, no. Remember I'm a queen

49:40.791 --> 49:42.642
and I cannot consort
with anyone but an equal.

49:42.666 --> 49:47.415
Supposing, just supposing, I did
what you wanted and I became emperor,

49:48.416 --> 49:49.915
what would be my reward?

49:50.916 --> 49:52.624
I'll show you.

49:57.125 --> 50:01.040
Hurr back.
I shall be waiting... impatiently.

50:01.583 --> 50:03.582
I'll be back. Don't you worr.

50:04.333 --> 50:05.999
Give me strength!

50:11.791 --> 50:15.874
Puer. Oh, puer, oh, puer!

50:16.000 --> 50:18.332
'Which, as any schoolboy knows,

50:18.458 --> 50:22.957
'means, "Boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy!"

50:25.291 --> 50:29.499
'So, as Mark Antony hurried back
from Cleo to his friend Caesar in Rome,

50:29.625 --> 50:33.374
'it looked as if one man's meat was going
to be another man's dose of rat poison.

50:33.500 --> 50:36.499
'While Caesar,
his popularity and safety guaranteed

50:36.625 --> 50:39.832
'by the reputation of his
bodyguard Hengist, carries on as usual.'

50:39.958 --> 50:41.957
Yes. Ver nice, dear.

50:42.083 --> 50:44.999
Thank you verymuch. Definitely me.

50:45.125 --> 50:46.874
Where's my laurels?

50:47.000 --> 50:48.582
Here they are, my lord.

50:48.708 --> 50:51.540
Silly me. I've been resting on 'em!

50:51.666 --> 50:52.767
Will that be all, my lord?

50:52.791 --> 50:55.374
You might just run an iron overythose
for me.

51:03.750 --> 51:05.415
I wish you'd get rid of that woman!

51:05.541 --> 51:07.082
Oh, don't be like that, dear.

51:07.208 --> 51:09.790
You know verywell
I've only got eyes for you.

51:09.916 --> 51:11.957
That's all I everyget nowadays, eyes.

51:12.083 --> 51:14.040
Go along with you.
Have another bunch of grapes.

51:16.291 --> 51:18.165
Excuse me, sir. Mark Antony is here.

51:18.291 --> 51:20.915
Oh, my friend!

51:21.041 --> 51:22.624
- Let him come in.
- Yes, sir.

51:25.375 --> 51:27.832
All right. You can go in now.

51:27.958 --> 51:29.957
- Thank you.
- Just a minute.

51:30.083 --> 51:31.790
I'd like your sword first.

51:31.916 --> 51:35.665
Have you gone raving mad?
I'm Caesar's friend.

51:35.791 --> 51:38.582
That's what they all say.
Come on. Hand overyyour sword.

51:38.708 --> 51:40.665
- Go and get...
- Watch it!

51:40.791 --> 51:44.082
Remember what happened to Bilious
and the others.

51:45.958 --> 51:47.582
There.

51:47.708 --> 51:51.082
That's better. OK. You can go in now.

51:51.208 --> 51:52.582
I don't get it.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.499
I just don't get it.

51:54.625 --> 51:59.665
How did you manage to dispatch
five of them, all by your idiot self?

52:00.416 --> 52:02.165
It was quite simple, really.

52:02.291 --> 52:04.707
I'm verysorry there wasn't more of them,
as a matter of fact.

52:04.833 --> 52:09.124
- I don't like things to be too onesided.
- Get away. Show me how you did it.

52:10.708 --> 52:12.249
Go on. Show me.

52:14.583 --> 52:17.540
Like this. I started off
with a couple of quick parries,

52:17.666 --> 52:19.707
like that you see, followed by the riposte.

52:19.833 --> 52:23.707
I gave him the cut and thrust, followed
by the pas-dedeux, and the old onetwo.

52:25.708 --> 52:27.207
What have I done?

52:27.333 --> 52:30.374
Forget it.
Nobody will everynotice the difference.

52:36.291 --> 52:39.540
I'm sorry, Venus, madam.

52:39.666 --> 52:41.332
- Tony!
- Julie!

52:41.458 --> 52:44.665
Oh, it is good to see you back.
How did everything go in Egypt?

52:44.791 --> 52:46.207
What a fantastic countr!

52:46.333 --> 52:48.665
You ought to see the pyramids.
And the Sphinx.

52:48.791 --> 52:51.790
Yes, that's because they have no drains,
of course.

52:51.916 --> 52:54.165
- But how did everything go?
- Oh, fine. Fine.

52:54.291 --> 52:57.207
- Everything went according to plan?
- Well, not quite.

52:57.333 --> 52:59.790
- What do you mean?
- You told me to get rid of Cleopatra

52:59.916 --> 53:01.415
and put Ptolemy on the throne.

53:01.541 --> 53:03.457
- Yes.
- I did it the other way round.

53:03.583 --> 53:05.832
Anyone could make a mistake,
I suppose.

53:05.958 --> 53:08.165
It wasn't a mistake. I did it on purpose.

53:08.291 --> 53:09.790
Cos quite frankly, I thought

53:09.916 --> 53:12.290
she would make
a much better queen than he would.

53:12.416 --> 53:14.082
She is the right sex, of course!

53:14.208 --> 53:16.540
Not only that. She's all for us Romans.

53:16.666 --> 53:18.040
How do you know?

53:19.000 --> 53:23.707
She told me that her greatest ambition
is to have a liaison with you.

53:23.833 --> 53:26.707
Hang on. Not in front of the wife.

53:26.833 --> 53:28.165
Hello, dear. How are you?

53:28.291 --> 53:31.624
Are you all right? Have another melon.

53:31.750 --> 53:34.290
Tell me more about this Cleopatra.
What's she like?

53:34.416 --> 53:37.374
You have got to see her.
Her hair is as black as ebony,

53:37.500 --> 53:40.707
her face is like an ivor goddess,
and her neck is like a swan.

53:40.833 --> 53:42.457
Oh, yes. Go on.

53:42.583 --> 53:45.976
- Her feet like sculptured marble.
- Don't leave out all the best bits!

53:46.000 --> 53:50.457
I cannot tell you any more about
this woman. She is absolute perfection.

53:50.583 --> 53:52.582
They call her the "Siren of the Nile."

53:52.708 --> 53:54.707
Oh! I hope she don't go off!

53:54.833 --> 53:57.124
I mean, they do tend to
in these hot countries.

53:57.250 --> 54:01.082
Don't worr. She's got a deep frieze
running round the walls of the palace.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.082
Well, I would like to meet her.

54:03.208 --> 54:05.624
But I don't see
how I can get away again so soon.

54:07.333 --> 54:09.207
Say it's an official visit.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.976
To do what?

54:11.000 --> 54:13.582
Tell her they want you
to open a tomb or something.

54:13.708 --> 54:17.707
Yes. It might work.
I don't know, though. Look at her.

54:18.916 --> 54:23.624
Julie, Julie. I tell you, you have
neveryseen a beauty such as this.

54:23.750 --> 54:26.249
And underneath, a raging passion,

54:26.375 --> 54:29.415
like a tempestuous stream
waiting to burst its banks!

54:29.541 --> 54:33.790
Oh, that's done it. Order my galley,
and find out what time the banks open.

54:34.916 --> 54:36.207
Come on!

54:39.916 --> 54:41.874
Go on. Move.

54:45.041 --> 54:46.540
What was all that?

54:46.666 --> 54:49.499
Just watching the galley slaves
come aboard.

54:49.625 --> 54:50.874
Right, now then.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.040
Before Caesar gets here, let's make
quite sure we understand each other.

54:54.166 --> 54:56.249
Caesar has got to die
before we reach Egypt.

54:56.375 --> 54:59.165
- I don't like it, Mark.
- You don't like it?

54:59.291 --> 55:01.999
I'm not asking you
to do verymuch, am I?

55:02.125 --> 55:03.999
I mean, it's not for my good, is it?

55:04.125 --> 55:05.976
- It's for the good of Rome.
- Are you sure?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.874
Course I'm sure. And on top of that,
when I'm emperor,

55:09.000 --> 55:10.290
I'll see you four are all right.

55:10.416 --> 55:13.707
Ah, verywell, but I wish
you hadn't asked me to slay him.

55:13.833 --> 55:15.957
- Why not?
- I'm his cousin.

55:16.083 --> 55:18.624
I can't do it, can I?
I'm his friend.

55:18.750 --> 55:20.957
? Fanfare.

55:21.083 --> 55:24.415
Here comes his new champ,
Maximus Big Bonce.

55:24.541 --> 55:26.582
- Hail.
- Hail.

55:31.208 --> 55:33.684
Morning, General. Are you all ready
for Caesar to come aboard?

55:33.708 --> 55:37.290
Oh, no. We're just standing here
to give the seagulls a bit of practice.

55:37.416 --> 55:41.249
Oh, yes? Well, er...
Where's the Captain?

55:41.375 --> 55:43.457
- Watch it!
- I'm Agrippa.

55:43.583 --> 55:47.915
And I know one or two holds myself.
So you wanna watch it, mate.

55:48.041 --> 55:50.624
He's the Captain. His name is Agrippa.

55:50.750 --> 55:52.665
Why couldn't he say so?

55:52.791 --> 55:55.749
Now, listen to me, all you men.

55:55.875 --> 55:59.749
Listen to...

55:59.875 --> 56:03.832
Listen to me, all you men, I'm responsible
for Caesar's safety on this ship.

56:03.958 --> 56:08.624
So if any of you are thinking of starting
anything, you've got to answer to me.

56:08.750 --> 56:10.499
Oh!

56:13.500 --> 56:15.290
I suppose you think that's funny.

56:17.583 --> 56:18.874
Right.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.332
I will now check Caesar's quarters.
Where are they?

56:22.458 --> 56:24.124
- Overyhere.
- Thank you.

56:26.750 --> 56:28.749
Argh!

56:33.416 --> 56:34.999
He'll have to go, too.

56:35.125 --> 56:36.749
? Fanfare.

56:36.875 --> 56:38.165
Hail, Caesar.

56:38.916 --> 56:40.290
Hail.

56:40.791 --> 56:43.374
Now, Julius,
do remember what I told you.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.832
Always wear your wool vest, see the beds
are aired, and don't drink the water.

56:47.958 --> 56:49.790
Yes, yes, yes. All right, dear.

56:49.916 --> 56:52.374
Don't have anything to do
with eastern women.

56:52.500 --> 56:55.957
- I've heard funny stories about them.
- It's a purely business tr...

56:56.083 --> 56:57.832
Really? What sort of stories?

56:57.958 --> 57:00.208
Well, there was this eastern...
Neverymind that!

57:00.232 --> 57:02.226
Why you're taking
her, I can't imagine.

57:02.250 --> 57:05.082
I've told you, dear.
I'm taking her to give to Cleopatra.

57:05.208 --> 57:07.343
I don't like turning
up without something.

57:07.367 --> 57:08.999
Why couldn't you have taken me?

57:09.125 --> 57:12.040
She wouldn't want you.
Now, run along, we've got to go.

57:12.166 --> 57:14.999
Well, I'm glad Daddy is going.
He can keep an eye on things.

57:15.125 --> 57:16.915
He's doing that already, the dirty old...

57:17.041 --> 57:20.207
- Seneca. Say your farewell.
- Oh, yes. Goodbye, dear.

57:20.333 --> 57:22.832
Not to her. She's going with us.

57:22.958 --> 57:25.726
Yes, I know, but this is more fun
than saying goodbye to my daughter.

57:25.750 --> 57:28.457
Come on. We've got to get under way.

57:28.583 --> 57:30.999
- Goodbye, Daddy.
- Goodbye, daughter.

57:31.125 --> 57:32.874
Goodbye, Julius.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.665
Goodbye. Good riddance.

57:35.791 --> 57:39.165
'And so, their proud ship
set sail for Egypt.

57:39.291 --> 57:42.457
'Little did they know
that down in the engine room,

57:42.583 --> 57:46.499
'a desperate man was preparing
to bung a spanner in the machiner.'

57:46.625 --> 57:48.165
In!

57:49.041 --> 57:50.290
Out!

57:51.291 --> 57:53.790
In!

57:53.916 --> 57:55.582
Out!

57:55.708 --> 57:57.665
Put your back into it, scum!

58:00.458 --> 58:02.978
- Will you have some, my lord?
- I don't know, dear. What is it?

58:03.083 --> 58:07.165
Delicious, my lord! It's peacocks' tongues
and alligators' brains in aspic.

58:07.291 --> 58:09.999
No, thank you, dear.
I don't think I'll bother.

58:10.125 --> 58:11.582
Oh. Will you have some, my lord?

58:11.708 --> 58:14.135
Well, I wouldn't mind a
little nibble, I must say!

58:14.159 --> 58:16.559
That'll be quite enough
of that sort of thing!

58:16.583 --> 58:18.540
I only wanted to see what was for afters.

58:18.666 --> 58:22.082
Did I everytell you about the feast
Cleopatra threw for me on her barge?

58:22.208 --> 58:24.582
Please don't mention throwing.

58:24.708 --> 58:28.832
- You are not well, my lord?
- Just a little sic transit, Gloria!

58:28.958 --> 58:31.332
In!

58:31.458 --> 58:33.499
Out!

58:33.625 --> 58:35.207
In!

58:35.875 --> 58:37.332
Out!

58:37.458 --> 58:39.415
All right. Take it easy.

58:39.541 --> 58:41.624
Rest.

58:43.625 --> 58:45.957
I can see the coast
about a quarter of a mile away.

58:46.083 --> 58:48.082
- That must be Africa.
- Right.

58:49.125 --> 58:51.832
What about a little swim, eh?

58:51.958 --> 58:54.582
Look out, he's coming.

58:54.708 --> 58:56.707
Right, you scum.

58:56.833 --> 58:58.665
Get ready for some rowing.

59:05.708 --> 59:06.999
You've done him in.

59:07.125 --> 59:09.582
I must've pulled the chain too hard.
Oh, well.

59:13.166 --> 59:16.165
Right, lads. Here we go.
Go off as quietly as possible.

59:16.291 --> 59:17.999
Slip overythe side and swim for it.

59:19.708 --> 59:21.290
There, Julie. Have a bit of fruit.

59:21.416 --> 59:23.999
I might just manage a bit of melon.

59:24.125 --> 59:26.290
Would you like some fruit, Hengist?

59:26.416 --> 59:27.457
What's this?

59:27.583 --> 59:30.082
They call that a banana.
Comes from Africa.

59:32.250 --> 59:33.749
Funny sort of taste, innit?

59:33.875 --> 59:37.540
- You're supposed to take the inside out.
- Oh. I see.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.124
Oh, yes. Much better.

59:43.250 --> 59:47.082
I meant to tell you.
I had a smashing vision last night.

59:47.208 --> 59:50.832
- Not another one.
- Yes. Stop me if you've heard it before.

59:50.958 --> 59:52.915
We were all sitting here having a meal.

59:53.416 --> 59:56.582
You went out onto the deck, and there
were Agrippa and all the other officers

59:56.708 --> 01:00:00.082
with their dirty great swords hanging out.
Most enjoyable!

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:02.207
Why, what happened?

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:04.832
They sliced your head in two.

01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:06.957
Oh! Oh!

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.790
Defend yourself, Caesar!

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:13.540
It's true!

01:00:13.666 --> 01:00:14.832
What's true?

01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:17.457
Agrippa and the others,
with their swords out.

01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:21.332
Oh, good.
I've neveryhad a vision come true before.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:24.499
What's going to happen to me?
What?

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:28.457
I told you. Your head
will be sliced completely in two.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.832
Oh, shut up!

01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:31.957
Caesar! Hear me!

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:34.415
What I am doing is for Rome.

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:37.124
Since you are a soldier like me,

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:40.832
I will give you the chance to face us,
sword in hand,

01:00:40.958 --> 01:00:43.332
and die with dignity!

01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:48.290
Did you hear them? They want me
to go out and face them, sword in hand,

01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:50.249
and die with dignity.

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:51.832
Help me!

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.749
You can borrow this if you like.

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:58.040
But I don't want to face them
and die with dignity!

01:00:58.166 --> 01:01:00.457
Then stick it up your toga
and go out backwards.

01:01:14.416 --> 01:01:18.374
Tony! You'll not let them slay me.
You'll take them on, won't you?

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.415
I'd like to, Julie,
but I can neveryfight on a full stomach.

01:01:21.541 --> 01:01:23.957
Oh, woe is me.

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:26.374
Is there to be no succour?

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.665
Yeah. There's always Hengist.

01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:31.040
Hengist! Of course. My champion.

01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:32.374
Where is he?

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.874
Yes?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.832
You will go out and face them.
There are only four of them.

01:01:36.958 --> 01:01:39.707
You needn't worr.
You can dispatch them quite easily.

01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:41.165
Me?

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:43.124
Yes. After all, that is your job.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.499
You're chief dispatching clerk!

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.874
But they don't want me.
They asked for you.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.999
- He's quite right, you know.
- Mind your own business.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:54.874
Pardon me, but it is my business.
After all, it was my vision.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.332
It's no good depending on that twit.
He's quivering with fright.

01:01:58.458 --> 01:02:00.499
I've just thought of something.

01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:04.707
Why don't we all keep quiet
and perhaps they'll go away.

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:06.165
No!

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:08.957
All right.

01:02:09.666 --> 01:02:11.790
I'll just take a few... practice swings.

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:17.999
En garde!

01:02:22.083 --> 01:02:24.290
Ha! Look at that!
They'll make mincemeat of him.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:29.415
We who are about to die, salute you.

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:31.540
Oh, don't be so formal.

01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:33.457
Come on.

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:45.040
One, two, three, four!

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:46.790
What happened?

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.707
Ah! You would, would you?
Right! Take that!

01:02:52.833 --> 01:02:54.832
Behind me, eh?

01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:56.957
You Roman rotter. Take that!

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:01.290
Right, that's three of 'em!

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:05.582
All right.

01:03:05.708 --> 01:03:07.624
You can come out now.

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:12.165
Hey! He's done it!

01:03:12.291 --> 01:03:13.999
Oh...

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:18.457
Sorr to have kept you waiting so long,
but I couldn't find my usual form today.

01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:20.707
My champion!

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:22.999
Oh, isn't he marvellous?

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:26.684
- I must do you some honour.
- It's all in the course of duty, sir.

01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:29.999
No. In recognition
of your great services to me,

01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:35.457
Centurion Pod, I hereby invest you
with the lmperial Order of the Bath.

01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:37.624
Don't lose that. It's the plug.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.207
Thank you, sir.
But all I really want is my freedom.

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:45.624
Well, we'll talk about that later
when we get to Alexandria perhaps.

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:47.415
If we everyget to Alexandria.

01:03:47.541 --> 01:03:49.082
If we... What do you mean?

01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:52.332
Well, haven't you noticed?
There's nobody rowing.

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:57.665
In! Out!

01:03:58.416 --> 01:04:00.915
- In...
- Oh, isn't it sickening?

01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:05.540
The emperor of the mighty
Roman Empire paddling his own canoe!

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.749
'Having arrived safely at Alexandria,

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:09.582
'Mark Antony
hurried ahead to the palace

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:11.665
'for his early morning cup of tea.

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:14.957
'He was too late.
Cleopatra had hogged all the milk.

01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:17.874
'What a woman she was,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.290
'immortalised in Macaulay's famous poem
The Lay Of Ancient Rome.

01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:24.749
'No wonder
Antony couldn't mark time!'

01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:26.915
- Cleo!
- Mark!

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:37.707
Oh, blimey. I wish you'd get out
of that bath now and then.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:41.207
Ah, you're cross.
Don't you love your little Cleo?

01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:43.415
As much as any man can love a woman

01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:45.749
who spends half her time
up to her neck in asses' milk.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:47.874
I only bathe four times a day.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.726
They must milk those asses
to a standstill.

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:51.790
Something's worring my little Markie.

01:04:51.916 --> 01:04:53.749
- I'll say there is.
- But what's wrong?

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:57.332
I'll tell you. Caesar still lives.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.790
- Still lives?
- Yeah. Still lives.

01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:01.207
You mean he's not dead?

01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:03.082
You catch on quick.

01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:04.665
But I don't understand.

01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:07.915
You said you were going
to get rid of him and be emperor yourself.

01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:11.374
I know I did, but the plot went wrong.
You can't get a coconut everytime.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.999
Oh. What a shame. I was so
looking forward to cementing our alliance.

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:20.874
There'll be plenty of time
to think about that sort of thing later.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.165
Right now, we've got to think what to do
about Caesar. He'll be here any minute.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.957
A fine way for an emperor to arrive,
I must say.

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:36.999
- Slogging through half a mile of sand.
- Yes?

01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:39.707
Good morning.
My name is Julius Caesar.

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:41.665
I represent the Roman Empire.

01:05:41.791 --> 01:05:43.457
No, thanks. Not today.

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:45.665
Well, really!

01:05:46.708 --> 01:05:49.540
Who does he think he is? Cheek!

01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:56.457
Think. Think.

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:58.915
There must be some way
we can get rid of him.

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:02.082
- I have a poisonous asp.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.249
Oh, no, no, no, no. I have. Look.

01:06:07.666 --> 01:06:09.915
One bite from this is enough.

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:13.912
You're right.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:17.017
One bite's enough for anyone.
That's shocking.

01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:19.415
No, no, no, no. It is supposed to bite you.

01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:21.499
Yes?

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:26.207
Julius Caesar and his party have arrived,
Your Majesty.

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:31.082
He assures you of his good will,
and sends this slave girl as a token.

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:35.082
Take them to my guest apartments,
Archimedes, and ask them to wait.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:37.249
Oh, and send the girl to my bedchamber.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.832
Well, what do we do now, then?

01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:46.874
- Bedchamber. That's it.
- What's it?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.207
Quiet. Here. Bangers, Sausages,
whateveryyour name is.

01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:52.790
Go to Caesar,
tell him that your queen will meet him

01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:56.624
in her private apartments first crow
of the cock tonight, understand?

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:01.040
What is going on?

01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:03.218
I can't do a thing until
I get him away from

01:07:03.242 --> 01:07:05.267
that bodyguard and that's
where you come in.

01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:06.351
Where have I been to?

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.415
You haven't been anywhere. You're there.

01:07:08.541 --> 01:07:12.749
Tr using your nut for a change.
All you've got to do is get Caesar alone.

01:07:12.875 --> 01:07:15.249
Oh, that's what he's come for,
money.

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.790
Alone! On his tod! By himself!

01:07:17.916 --> 01:07:19.582
Oh. You should have said.

01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:24.082
Just get him into your bedchamber. I'll
be waiting there, and then we'll do it!

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.415
Do what?

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.374
Oh, blimey. There must be
an easier way to make a killing.

01:07:32.166 --> 01:07:33.957
That'll be Cleopatra.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.040
- Shall I let her in?
- Just a minute.

01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:39.165
Give me a chance to... look all sexy.

01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:44.874
Come in.

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:51.082
- Is that her?
- Of course not.

01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:54.249
What is it, my good man?
You have some message for me?

01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:57.249
Well, speak up.
Have you lost your tongue?

01:07:58.166 --> 01:08:01.499
Oh, well, neverymind.
You could lose worse things than that.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:04.957
I know a bit about sign language.
Let me tell him.

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:10.165
Now, look here, my good man,
that is Caesar. You know?

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:12.457
And he wants an alliance...

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:15.082
with Cleopatra.

01:08:20.916 --> 01:08:22.874
Neverymind all the maps.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.999
When do we meet her? When?

01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:31.249
- He's going to lay an egg.
- No, no, no. He means at cockcrow.

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:34.165
What cock?
The morning one or the evening one?

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:35.999
Evening cock.

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:37.874
Thanks, cock. I'll be ready.

01:08:38.666 --> 01:08:40.415
Oh, and by the way,

01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:43.124
tell her I'll be bringing my bodyguard
with me.

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:45.499
There will be two of us.

01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:47.665
You understand? Two.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.915
What's happening?
Put me down. Hengist!

01:08:56.041 --> 01:08:58.165
That's enough of that. Drop it. Drop!

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:03.499
That's better.
You want to watch it, mate.

01:09:13.457 --> 01:09:16.249
I suppose it's his way of saying,
"get knotted"!

01:09:16.832 --> 01:09:18.957
- Now, tell me again.
- Just listen this time.

01:09:19.082 --> 01:09:22.249
Now, listen. You lure Caesar
into your bedchamber, right?

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:24.332
- Yes.
- I'm hidden there beforehand, right?

01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:26.832
- Yes.
- Then I run him through. You got it now?

01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:29.040
- No.
- Oh, strewth!

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:32.874
- Suppose he doesn't want to be lured?
- He will if you get him in the right mood.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.207
I know. I'll give him a love philtre.

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:37.332
- A what?
- A love philtre.

01:09:37.457 --> 01:09:39.267
Oh, is that what you do out here?

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:41.332
You filter it? Oh, no, no, no.
This stuff.

01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:43.165
You put a bit of it in their wine,

01:09:43.291 --> 01:09:45.832
and then they get all sort of...
well, you know.

01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:50.415
Oh, yes. I come across some of this
in Spain once.

01:09:52.332 --> 01:09:54.040
How long before your next bath?

01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:57.040
Oh, not till this evening.

01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:58.457
Cheers.

01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:01.874
I usually have the blow wave.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.665
Yes, well, I'm no good at that, sir.

01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:06.165
But I know where I am with an iron.

01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:08.290
Be careful you don't singel me.

01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:12.082
There's nothing more off-putting in affairs
of these sorts than the smell of burning.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.749
"I can smell something burning!"

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:16.395
"Darling, go down and see what it is."

01:10:17.166 --> 01:10:20.707
- Spoils everything.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:22.749
What is it?

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:26.582
Beware... the ides of March!

01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:28.749
Oh, dear, he's back.
Where have you been?

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:31.165
The time has come.

01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:34.249
I've seen the writing on the wall.

01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:36.665
Oh, so that's where you've been.

01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:42.832
Look what I've found in the market place.

01:10:42.958 --> 01:10:44.540
Good gracious. What is it?

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:47.707
He can see into the future.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:51.582
Go on, then. You wait until you hear
what he's got to say.

01:10:51.708 --> 01:10:53.790
Sooth! Sooth!

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.874
You see? He's a soothsayer.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.165
Sooth. Sooth.

01:10:59.291 --> 01:11:03.165
- Now tell them what you told me.
- There is death this night.

01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:05.457
I have seen it in the fire.

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:08.624
- What fire?
- Gather round and have a butcher's.

01:11:10.916 --> 01:11:15.999
I will see whether the goddess
will grant us a further vision.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:23.540
O, lsis, sweet lsis...
They're lovely!

01:11:23.666 --> 01:11:26.082
I'm verysorry, sir.
It's an old British saying.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.540
Sweet lsis!

01:11:29.666 --> 01:11:33.582
Grant us a vision,
we beseech you.

01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:36.040
There!

01:11:37.166 --> 01:11:39.124
Look. A picture is forming.

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:41.249
A vision.

01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:45.874
Cor! Cor!
Now, that's what I call a vision!

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.790
- Who is she?
- Queen Cleopatra.

01:11:48.916 --> 01:11:53.165
She is preparing herself
for a most important meeting.

01:11:53.291 --> 01:11:55.290
That will be the one with me!

01:11:55.416 --> 01:11:59.915
Now it is time for her
to get dressed.

01:12:00.041 --> 01:12:02.165
She needn't bother.

01:12:02.291 --> 01:12:04.665
Oh, she's about to step out of her bath!

01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:06.665
It's gone. What's happened?

01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:09.957
It always happens
in the most interesting parts.

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:13.082
Well, don't just stand there,
do something. Get it back again.

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.290
Sure. I'll have a go.

01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:22.332
Oh, look there! Look.

01:12:22.458 --> 01:12:24.957
Something's starting.
Something's forming.

01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:26.165
Where?

01:12:26.291 --> 01:12:30.957
It is later.
I see Queen Cleopatra's apartment.

01:12:31.083 --> 01:12:32.832
It's all bare!

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:34.457
That's more like it.

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:39.499
It is prepared
for feasting and merrmaking.

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:43.290
And now, two men are entering.

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:45.374
Look!

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.915
- It's me!
- And me.

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:50.832
Just look at me.

01:12:50.958 --> 01:12:53.665
The poor girl doesn't stand a chance.

01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:55.790
There is a fanfare of trumpets.

01:12:55.916 --> 01:12:57.874
? Fanfare.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.957
And Queen Cleopatra is brought in.

01:13:03.791 --> 01:13:06.832
Wait a minute. What's all this?
Where's Cleopatra?

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:10.249
Oh, in the carpet? All right.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:12.249
Beat it.

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.540
Hengist, give me your sword, please.

01:13:16.416 --> 01:13:17.999
Thank you.

01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:20.999
Now, stand by that door
and see that we are not disturbed.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.999
A magnificent entrance, my dear.

01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:45.457
And worthy of a great queen.

01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:47.457
Oh, it's just practice.

01:13:47.583 --> 01:13:51.165
- So you are the great Caesar?
- Aha! You recognised me.

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:53.707
I have seen your bust.

01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:56.040
I wish I could say the same.

01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:58.915
- Dost thou like what thou seest?
- I certainly doth.

01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:02.249
Tony was right. You are lovely.
I am enamoured.

01:14:02.375 --> 01:14:05.082
I shall divorce Calpurnia and marr you.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:09.249
I shall be a great emperor.
You will be a great queen.

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:12.874
Together we shall rule the world.
Any questions?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.832
Just one.
Aren't we going to cement our alliance?

01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:18.832
Of course.
I've brought along a clean trowel!

01:14:18.958 --> 01:14:20.999
Oh, no, no, no. Not here.

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:23.749
Come to my room alone in one moment.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.999
You're not going in there alone, sir?

01:14:30.125 --> 01:14:33.124
Yes, it's perfectly all right.
Nothing is gonna happen.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.415
- What are you going in for?
- Oh, peasant!

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:41.165
Come, Caesar. Sit beside me.

01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:56.457
It's gone again. What's the matter
with the wretched thing?

01:14:56.583 --> 01:14:58.207
The fire's dying.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:01.207
Absolutely sickening.
We're missing all the best bits.

01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:05.624
Wait. Look there!
Look, it's started again. I see something.

01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:12.165
What's happened?
Where have we gone?

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:15.790
Is this a dagger that I see before me?

01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.665
It is... Argh!

01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:32.332
'Caesar hadn't had
such a pain in the stomach

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:34.707
'since the day the imperial cook
put a mustard plaster

01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:36.499
'on his lobster thermidor.

01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:38.374
'But all was not yet lost.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.415
'Horsa and the other galley slaves
had escaped from the galley,

01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:46.290
'and swum safely to shore, after beating
off repeated attacks of cramp and crabs,

01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:49.415
'and made their way
overythe desert towards the great city,

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.874
'guided by the smell of the drains.'

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.374
- I thought so. Nile water.
- Hey, look overythere.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.874
Cleopatra's palace.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.707
Yes. And a galley waiting for us, eh?

01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:03.624
We'll rest here till it gets dark, men,
then we'll swim across, find some food,

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:06.332
and it's back home to Britain. Ha ha ha!

01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:09.249
Where am I?

01:16:09.375 --> 01:16:11.332
He's coming to.
Hurr up with that water.

01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:13.999
- I'm trying to find a clean pitcher.
- Forget it.

01:16:14.125 --> 01:16:18.207
Tr and remember you're in Egypt.
They only have dirty pitchers here.

01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:22.499
What's that?

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.874
"King Tutankhamen's ashes!"

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Oh!

01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:28.749
The ashes! Now I remember!

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.749
The pictures in the fire!

01:16:32.666 --> 01:16:35.957
Aha! Tonight's the night, eh?

01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:39.517
What's the matter?
Don't you want to meet her?

01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:42.832
Tony, I am undone. My end is in sight.

01:16:42.958 --> 01:16:46.374
You'd better do yourself up again quick.
What's the matter with him?

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.915
We've seen visions.
Oh, they were lovely.

01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:50.041
Visions? What visions?

01:16:50.166 --> 01:16:54.374
Me lying on the floor of the bedchamber
with a dagger in my vitals.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.457
Yes, that one was quite good,
but I preferred the one of her in her bath.

01:16:57.583 --> 01:17:01.457
Don't pay too much attention to visions.
They get distorted and out of proportion.

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:03.999
You're quite right.
She was a bit much here and there.

01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:06.749
I wish you wouldn't
keep talking about her in the bath.

01:17:06.875 --> 01:17:11.040
This is serious.
I'm about to be treacherously slain.

01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:14.582
Julie, Julie!
Why should she wanna slay you?

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:16.624
I just spent the afternoon with her,

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:19.934
and all she did was talk about the kick
she's gonna from of meeting you at last.

01:17:19.958 --> 01:17:23.957
I daresay, but I think we should forget
the whole thing and go home, don't you?

01:17:24.083 --> 01:17:28.165
What? And have all Rome know
that Caesar ran from a mere woman?

01:17:28.291 --> 01:17:29.499
That would finish you.

01:17:29.625 --> 01:17:32.415
You're right.
You promised them an alliance.

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:35.749
You're the only bloke who can get it.
Just relax and enjoy your work.

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:39.582
Will you go with me when I meet her,
Tony? You're my friend. You are!

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:42.082
Julie, of course I'm your friend.

01:17:42.208 --> 01:17:43.832
But I can't come with you right now.

01:17:43.958 --> 01:17:47.165
There's a young lady I met here last time.
Daughter of a sheik.

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:50.457
Arab, eh?
I believe they are intense lovers.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:53.457
Well, naturally,
they do everything in tents!

01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:58.624
Tents!

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:01.957
I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:04.624
No. You're quite right.
Tents are too draughty.

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:07.249
I wish you'd stick to the point.

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:11.207
If only that vision
hadn't broken down halfway!

01:18:11.333 --> 01:18:16.790
I want to know what happened between
me kissing her and me lying on the floor.

01:18:16.916 --> 01:18:19.749
Wait a minute. Cleopatra doesn't know
what you look like, does she?

01:18:19.875 --> 01:18:21.457
No. We've neverymet. Why?

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.790
Supposing someone pretended
to be you.

01:18:23.916 --> 01:18:27.707
Someone
who's strong and handsome and vital.

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.374
What a good idea!

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.582
I've found something.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:35.082
Here we are.
This is a verystrong liquor called arak,

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:36.999
makes you feel a different person.

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:40.749
Good. Then you'd better drink it!

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:43.957
'The stage was set.
The plot was murder.

01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:49.290
'And with the dying sun,
came the sound of the evening cockcrow.

01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:50.540
'He's late.'

01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:54.499
'Thank you.

01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:57.957
'Remember,
Mark Antony was Caesar's friend.

01:18:58.083 --> 01:19:00.290
'So, out of the kindness of his heart,

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:03.665
'he was determined not to tickle him
with a jagged edge.'

01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:08.832
Right. Here goes.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.582
There's hospitality for you.

01:19:26.708 --> 01:19:28.749
Tell the others to come on up.

01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:41.290
- You!
- Horsa!

01:19:41.416 --> 01:19:42.749
Gloria!

01:19:46.458 --> 01:19:48.707
Oh, am I dreaming? Is it really you?

01:19:48.833 --> 01:19:51.665
I neverythought...
I neverythought I'd see you again.

01:19:51.791 --> 01:19:57.457
- I searched for you all overyBritain.
- I can hardly believe that you... Argh!

01:19:57.583 --> 01:20:00.290
It's all right. They're friends of mine.
Help yourselves.

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:05.957
Come on.

01:20:08.166 --> 01:20:09.999
There's no time to explain now.

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:11.665
We have a galley below here.

01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:15.374
Climb down to it and wait for us.
All right, love? Off you go.

01:20:17.916 --> 01:20:19.457
Seth, guard the door.

01:20:23.416 --> 01:20:26.216
Right, lads, let's get as much of
this stuff as we can into the galley.

01:20:26.583 --> 01:20:29.707
- Quick. Someone's coming.
- There's no time to get back. Follow me.

01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:34.665
What the...?

01:20:38.958 --> 01:20:40.999
In here, gentlemen, please.

01:20:41.125 --> 01:20:43.415
Her Majesty will be with you
in just one moment.

01:20:43.541 --> 01:20:46.332
- Thank you.
- Oh, no. Not you. Out.

01:20:46.458 --> 01:20:48.374
Oh, can't I stay and watch?

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.124
No, you can't, you dirty old sage.

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:53.332
Go on. Out.

01:20:53.458 --> 01:20:55.582
Now, for heaven's sake, relax.

01:20:56.708 --> 01:20:58.290
Stop playing with your thing.

01:20:58.416 --> 01:21:01.165
I can't relax.
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:04.207
- What sort of thing?
- Oh, you know.

01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:05.773
Making passionate love and all that.

01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:08.957
What? But you've been married
for ten years.

01:21:09.083 --> 01:21:11.165
That's what I mean. I'm not used to it.

01:21:11.291 --> 01:21:14.207
Oh, for Jupiter's sake,
it's not as difficult as that.

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:16.874
You saw the visions.
You saw how I did it.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.290
And I saw what happened to you, too.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:23.207
You needn't worry. That won't happen
to you. You are impregnable.

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:25.790
Oh, please.
I've explained about that once.

01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:27.540
Come on.

01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:39.040
What are you doing?

01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:41.915
Making sure she hasn't got a dagger
hidden in the bed.

01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:44.707
Come on. Help me!

01:21:47.833 --> 01:21:49.540
There's something under the bed.

01:21:49.666 --> 01:21:51.499
It's all right. It won't be in that.

01:21:51.625 --> 01:21:52.915
Come on.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.832
There's no dagger there,
so stop worring.

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.665
Hey. That wasn't there before.

01:22:16.791 --> 01:22:18.374
- What?
- That.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.540
Oh, it must have been.
Don't be so nervy.

01:22:21.666 --> 01:22:23.249
What you need is a good stiff drink.

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:24.999
No, thank you. I don't want one.

01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:32.624
Yes, I do.

01:22:41.416 --> 01:22:43.832
Blimey. She must be selling tickets.

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:46.165
? Fanfare.

01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:47.499
That'll be her.

01:22:47.625 --> 01:22:50.082
No. That wasn't a cockcrow,
that was a fanfare.

01:22:50.208 --> 01:22:53.040
It's a fan-tailed cock by now.
Pull yourself together.

01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:05.124
Well, don't just stand there. Open it.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.415
Go on. Open it.

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:23.082
Oh, go on. Unroll it.

01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:38.499
Madam! Mate!

01:23:39.416 --> 01:23:40.624
I'm terribly sorry.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:45.082
There we are, my dear.
Oh, that's not part of you, is it?

01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:46.290
No.

01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:50.874
The mighty Caesar does not know
his own mighty strength.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.999
So you are the great Caesar?

01:23:53.125 --> 01:23:56.582
That's right.
No, no, I'm his body belt. Bodyguard.

01:23:56.708 --> 01:24:00.207
- He is Caesar.
- Oh. You do not look like your bust.

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:02.665
No, he's not.
He's just a bit cracked.

01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:05.999
Dost thou like what thou seest, Caesar?

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:07.290
Well, go on. Tell her.

01:24:07.416 --> 01:24:09.749
- Hm?
- You know. The speech.

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:12.957
"Tony was right. You are lovely."

01:24:13.083 --> 01:24:14.874
Tony was right. I'm lovely.

01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:19.415
"I am an emperor.
You will be a great queen."

01:24:19.541 --> 01:24:22.374
You are an emperor.
I'm a great queen.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.290
Oh!

01:24:24.416 --> 01:24:27.040
No, no, great queen.

01:24:27.166 --> 01:24:31.915
What Caesar is trying to say,
and making a right imperial mess of it,

01:24:32.041 --> 01:24:34.332
is that he's completely captivated
by your beauty

01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:37.874
and wishes to form an alliance.

01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:42.707
Oh, yes. Yes.
And all that stuff.

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:46.499
Well, I do not make alliances in public,
Caesar.

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.260
Well, that's that, then.
I'd better be going.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.290
Wait a minute. Come back.

01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:54.540
No, you don't understand.
He's a bit shy.

01:24:54.666 --> 01:24:58.707
Oh, is that all?
I've got something that will overcome that.

01:25:08.708 --> 01:25:10.457
What's that?

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:14.457
It er... shall we say...
makes one feel a little more... friendly.

01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:22.415
Drink this,
and come to my room in one minute.

01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:24.124
Alone!

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:30.040
Go on. Drink it, then.

01:25:43.875 --> 01:25:45.540
Are you there?

01:25:45.666 --> 01:25:47.790
Of course I'm here.
How much longer are you gonna be?

01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:02.040
- Has it worked?
- Yeah.

01:26:03.583 --> 01:26:04.624
Give me a kiss.

01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:07.011
No, no, no. Not me.
It's her. It's her.

01:26:07.035 --> 01:26:09.892
That would be a bit better.
Get out of my way.

01:26:09.916 --> 01:26:12.165
Wait a minute. Don't overdo it.
You've got to...

01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:14.374
Don't tell me what to do...

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:19.374
pheasant.

01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:22.540
Ah, you feel better, Caesar?

01:26:22.666 --> 01:26:30.666
Cor!

01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:36.415
I say!

01:26:36.541 --> 01:26:38.499
I must have a drink of that stuff myself!

01:26:40.083 --> 01:26:42.290
Whew! You are better!

01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:43.874
Excuse me. I feel a bit faint.

01:26:45.708 --> 01:26:46.790
That's better.

01:26:46.916 --> 01:26:50.624
Now, come and sit beside me,
and we'll work out our alliance.

01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:23.375
You!

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.457
You've messed things up once too often!

01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:27.124
Look out, Hengist!

01:27:30.166 --> 01:27:31.999
Horsa! Where have you been?

01:27:32.125 --> 01:27:34.915
There's no time for that now.
To the galley, lads!

01:27:36.833 --> 01:27:38.124
Right. Let's get out of here.

01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:40.124
Sosages! Help!

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:42.374
Sosages!

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:46.457
Wait! What about poor old Caesar?

01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:49.290
- Leave him.
- I can't. I'm his bodyguard.

01:27:50.541 --> 01:27:54.207
Did you see? That was Tony in there
waiting for me with a dagger!

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:56.499
- Neverymind that.
- But he was my friend!

01:27:56.625 --> 01:27:58.540
Come on.

01:27:59.416 --> 01:28:01.999
Right, give me your sword.

01:28:02.125 --> 01:28:04.582
No, no, no. Let Hengist. He's best at it.

01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:08.290
What? You've got this all wrong.
It wasn't me.

01:29:07.541 --> 01:29:09.124
I did it!

01:29:10.875 --> 01:29:12.332
I actually did it!

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.665
Well done. Come on.

01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:36.582
Oh, wait for me! Wait for me!

01:29:36.708 --> 01:29:38.790
Wait for me!

01:29:42.833 --> 01:29:44.999
Argh!

01:29:46.333 --> 01:29:48.040
Who's this?

01:29:50.291 --> 01:29:51.790
Just call me... urn!

01:29:51.916 --> 01:29:55.790
'So it was that Caesar's life
had been saved for the third time.

01:29:55.916 --> 01:29:58.415
'He was able to sail home to Europe
from Africa

01:29:58.541 --> 01:30:02.249
'without having been stabbed, poisoned,
choked or married.

01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:05.040
'On the other hand, he now faced
the somewhat tricky task

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:08.165
'of selling the senate
on the idea of the wind of change.'

01:30:08.291 --> 01:30:11.165
Well, gentlemen, here we are again.

01:30:11.291 --> 01:30:12.790
How are you? Are you all right?

01:30:12.916 --> 01:30:14.999
Death to Caesar!

01:30:18.208 --> 01:30:21.249
Oh! Hello, hello!

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:24.415
Do I detect a feeling of animosity here?

01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:27.165
Stabbed... six times!

01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:29.499
Am I to end thus?

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:34.415
Perforated... Oh! Et tu brute!

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.540
So dies Caesar!

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:42.374
Let me just say these last words to you.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.540
Friends... Romans...

01:30:45.666 --> 01:30:47.915
- Countrmen!
- I know!

01:30:48.041 --> 01:30:50.290
Oh, what's the use?

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.665
'Hengist and Horsa
returned to Britain.

01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:57.290
'Where Gloria shyly allowed Horsa
to lead her to the altar.

01:31:00.458 --> 01:31:03.207
'Hengist too had been far from idle.

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:10.165
'Travel had opened up for him a new life
that was rich and full.'

01:31:10.291 --> 01:31:12.790
Wouldn't you like to come inside
for a bit, darling?

01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:14.457
I might.

01:31:32.125 --> 01:31:36.624
'And as for Mark and Cleo,
life was just one long Saturday night.'

01:31:37.916 --> 01:31:41.832
Oh, there you are!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
