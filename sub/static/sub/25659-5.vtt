from selling these drugs.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.680
How do we do that?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.560
We set up a sting.

-Why here?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.480
hought we were meeting in a pub.
-No, it's a work thing.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.040
I need money to entrap Blake.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.680
Don't worry, I'm up for it...

Yeah.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.760
[Rich] Ah!

16:57.120 --> 16:58.640
And we complement each other.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.400
Yeah, she's serious. All right,
I'm a bit more light-hearted.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.000
She is so ambitious...

17:06.280 --> 17:08.400
I'm pretty workshy...

17:08.440 --> 17:10.160
Can't see where it went wrong.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.800
not answering your phone, Harry.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.080
ld I be worried? I've got better
o do than see you self-destruct.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.560

17:44.680 --> 17:45.800
[croupier] 36, red.

[boat horn]

18:03.200 --> 18:04.280
Are you okay?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.280
You sounded upset.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.680
I'm fine, never better.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.400
So, Rich...

18:15.120 --> 18:16.600
has moved on...

18:18.600 --> 18:19.720
And so have I.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.800
So...

18:28.440 --> 18:30.200
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine...

18:31.360 --> 18:32.800
Let's do shots.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.560
-[she laughs]
-Whoa. Steady. Steady.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.200
Steady Orwell.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.400
Good old reliable Orwell...

18:45.000 --> 18:47.560
With your broad shoulders
and your sad eyes.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.120
[she sighs]

18:50.440 --> 18:51.760
Thanks... I think.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.800
You have always been there.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.800
Don't you want to?

19:06.760 --> 19:08.040
Not like this.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.520
I think we need to get you home.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.200
Come on.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.360

, "Please look after this bear."

19:27.600 --> 19:29.560
ere's Suri? You're not with her?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.200
-Suri was here?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.760
Maybe... she's left.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.040
be it's time to call it a night.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.480
-Looks like it.
-So...

19:39.520 --> 19:41.000
You must be the fun brother?

19:41.400 --> 19:42.560
I have my moments.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.240
There's a poker game nearby.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.120
e being told what's good for me.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.000
it even more when they're right.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.560
Thanks, anyway.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.240
If ever you change your mind.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.200
Oh, London's finest, huh?

20:16.280 --> 20:17.640
It's like dining in a morgue.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.640
-[inaudible]
-Father.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.280
e Wu Chi were formed to seek out
y the instruments of ill fortune

20:27.320 --> 20:29.280
that have corrupted
the harmony of the world.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.160
I give you the first bracelet.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.600
What is this, a game show?

20:38.480 --> 20:40.520
s a model to showcase the prize?

20:40.560 --> 20:41.600
She's not a model.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.800
She's much more than that.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.200
Eve is a Torch.

20:48.760 --> 20:49.720
No, wait.

20:50.760 --> 20:51.680
She's with us now.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.240
She will help us remove
the second bracelet.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.000
Can she be trusted?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.400
she's working with Madam Cheung.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.040
You need me.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.720
have no choice but to trust me.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.480
Just as I had no choice
when I became a Torch.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.440
I've made mistakes...

21:12.480 --> 21:13.600
I want to put that right.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.640
And how will you do that?

21:16.200 --> 21:19.000
By removing the bracelet
from Harry Clayton's wrist.

21:19.520 --> 21:23.680
enerate more bad luck than good,
but it still has power.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.280
And that makes him a threat.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.040
Soon we will fulfil our destiny.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.200
[Tai Jing] You take your father
for a fool?

21:49.080 --> 21:53.240
en informed, the poisoned drugs,
five dead people...

21:53.560 --> 21:54.800

21:55.040 --> 21:56.160
I don't understand.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.560
e everything you've asked of me.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.160
Times change.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.760
We are a business empire,
not relic hunters.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.560
You insult the traditions
of our founding fathers.

22:06.600 --> 22:10.400
ur obsession with the bracelets,
it led you to carelessness!

22:18.360 --> 22:19.360
[sighs]

22:19.400 --> 22:20.520
How much this time?

22:21.480 --> 22:22.680
Don't ask.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.800
suppose you could see a way to--
-No, no, no, no, no, no...

22:27.400 --> 22:28.680
You already owe me, Harry.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.360
e that things been on the fritz,
you started gambling again.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.040
Why?

22:37.520 --> 22:38.600
I don't know.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.480
I don't know.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.200
A test maybe?

22:43.440 --> 22:45.640
You know, because
this stops functioning, so do I.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.640
-[doorbell rings]
-You can't die on me, bro.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.600
at least until you pay me back.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
w much was it again, a tenner, I
think...?

22:52.400 --> 22:54.240
Try ten grand.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.200
Who said you could call me bro?

22:58.480 --> 22:59.720
Look, just keep me posted.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.240
Thanks.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.400
Death toll is now eight.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.400
Did you get the money?

23:06.280 --> 23:10.000
-No. But I... will by tonight.
-[doorbell]

23:10.400 --> 23:11.480
Is that mine?

23:12.680 --> 23:14.200
] Don't worry it is all in hand.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.040
You're a life saver.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.040
I do anything stupid last night?

23:20.080 --> 23:21.000
No.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.640
No, you were fine. All good.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.480
You all right?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.720
Oh, Rich, how narcissistic...

23:29.120 --> 23:30.720
Oh, no, those are my spare keys.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.080
I have his wee face on there
so I know where I'm going.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.000
people's spare keys do you have?

23:36.240 --> 23:37.360
You'd be surprised.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.040
rgive me for asking the obvious,
but...

23:42.000 --> 23:44.160
how do we convince
the Triads to sell to us?

23:44.680 --> 23:46.080
I mean, we are just... us.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.600
I know just the man.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.520
What if I said I could get Vice
off your back?

24:02.520 --> 24:04.080
-What's the catch?
-I need a favour...

24:05.040 --> 24:07.600
A one-off,
meone to pose as a heroin fixer.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.320
What would I know about that?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.640
Hmm.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.360
at would I know about this place
being an illicit knocking shop?

24:17.800 --> 24:20.760
ou'll be protected by the police
every step of the way.

24:20.800 --> 24:24.120
u do this one thing for me, Vice
ver bother you again. I promise.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.800
[sighs]

24:30.120 --> 24:32.080
Okay, we have a deal.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.800
As long as it's nothing to do
with those psycho Snake Hands.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.320
That's awkward.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.400
I nearly took a bullet for you,
do you remember?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
Yeah, I do.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.200

in front of his wife.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.160
-[Harry] Shit.
-Drive-by.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.200
t's got to have been the Wu Chi,
following Blake's orders.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.360
He is out of control.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.640
Whatever you are doing,
you'd better do it fast.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.560
I'm on it. Gotta go.

25:57.120 --> 26:00.680
Thank you for...
to meet me at such short notice.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.520
I'm looking to buy...
supply of heroin for my client.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.240
flew in from France this morning
to find that my...

26:08.800 --> 26:10.320
usual vendor let me down.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.160
I'm due to fly back tonight.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.320
Search me.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.280
Be as thorough as you want.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.600
nd pointed me in your direction.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.520
Who's this friend?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.000
Mickey Doyle.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.560
A supplier let him down,

26:29.600 --> 26:31.400
so you can see
I'm keen not to let my client...

26:33.440 --> 26:34.400
down.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.280
[Eve] Okay.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.600
Do you have cash?

26:52.240 --> 26:53.360
So?

26:53.560 --> 26:55.360
5:00pm tonight, ferry terminal.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.000
Yeah, me and her boss.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.320
-Her?
-Ha!

27:00.520 --> 27:06.200
Talk about fit, blonde, slim,
reen eyes, leathers, posh... Ha!

27:07.200 --> 27:08.600
Gave the old man tingles...

27:09.640 --> 27:12.120
But we agreed 250k.
You've got that, right?

27:12.800 --> 27:15.400
-Yeah, of course.
ust call Vice like you promised.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.000
Okay...

27:34.160 --> 27:35.240
Something wrong?

27:35.760 --> 27:37.200
I... just...

27:37.680 --> 27:39.200
ven't heard from you in a while.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.200
Should we be seen talking?

27:42.480 --> 27:44.000
Any leads on Harry Clayton?

27:47.560 --> 27:49.360
ing on Clayton, but any day now.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.000
Eve Alexandri?

27:52.400 --> 27:53.560
We think she drowned.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.480
ld never presume anything, Elsa.
You must be losing your touch.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.360
e had a lot to process recently.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.200
to have a turf war on our hands,
Triads versus Albanians.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.800
You wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

28:11.360 --> 28:12.320
You look tired.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.600
Can't be easy
attling around that empty house.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.440
Unable to sleep.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.360
] I knew you'd change your mind.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.400
How come?

28:36.200 --> 28:37.560
Takes a deviant to know one.

28:39.320 --> 28:43.600
See your five hundred,
raise you two thousand.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.480
Call.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.000
You okay?

29:05.720 --> 29:06.680
Not really.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.720
I just saw Blake.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.320
I think he suspects.
I think he's been following me.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.520
mentioned about me living alone.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.600
arry has secured this drug deal.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.280
If you want to back out...
It's not exactly by the books?

29:20.320 --> 29:23.640
No, eight people dead already.
hat copper walks away from that?

29:40.120 --> 29:41.080
The buyer...

29:42.120 --> 29:43.200
I did some checks.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.360
Good work.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.520
Take it, if you need it.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.440
don't deserve to criticise you.

29:51.640 --> 29:54.360
Look at them, sat on their arses
ng tea, and moaning about money.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.320
They're more WI than Wu Chi.

29:58.320 --> 30:04.040
r father spoke of your obsession
racelets like it was a weakness.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.640
Only you and I truly understand
the damage they wreak.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.400
They should follow your lead.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.760
see you fighting for the cause.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
Right.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.600
That's me, guys.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.800
I've got what I came for.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.480
Really?

31:19.120 --> 31:20.640
u're not going already, are you?

31:27.040 --> 31:28.160
Okay.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.040
f Dogs waterfront, 5:00 pm, hmm.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.760
Good. I will do the deal.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.280
But the client asked for me.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.600
Just me.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.760
Our business has been erratic
for some time.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.560

31:51.200 --> 31:55.200
What use are the bracelets
if our reputation is shot?

31:56.160 --> 32:00.200
Since when...
ofit become the Wu Chi priority?

32:03.040 --> 32:05.200
When the winds of change blow...

32:05.560 --> 32:10.200

others build windmills.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.400
e not using him, it's too risky,
I'll do it.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.400
But Blake knows you.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.160

34:06.200 --> 34:07.520
If that's what it takes...

34:07.560 --> 34:09.600
This was our one chance.
I trusted you, Clayton.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.360
Listen, all I need to do
is to get Blake on camera,

34:11.400 --> 34:14.160
tie him to the bad drugs,
expose him as a liar to MI6.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.400
It's a risk worth taking.

34:15.800 --> 34:16.760
It's a bit kamikaze but...

34:17.000 --> 34:18.200
We'll have you covered, Harry.
