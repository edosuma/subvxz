Mom, there's something wrong here.
There are these voices--

Hello, Mrs. O'Connor.
This is the headmaster.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.000
I just want to reassure you

19:37.433 --> 19:39.600
that we're doing everything possible
to change Brian.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.667
He's a bit of a tough case,
but we guarantee he'll be just perfect

19:43.167 --> 19:44.667
when you come to pick him up.

19:44.667 --> 19:48.667
Thank you, Mrs. O'Connor.
Bye-bye.
