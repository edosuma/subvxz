00:24.438 --> 00:25.837
Cool!

00:25.872 --> 00:28.739
Hey, Pop, you didn't tell us
we were going to Africa today!

00:28.775 --> 00:30.265
Ahh, great. They're up.

00:30.310 --> 00:32.870
Dude, look! Elephants!

00:32.913 --> 00:34.107
That's...

00:34.147 --> 00:36.672
Loxodonta africana.

00:36.717 --> 00:39.845
You can tell which ones are the males
because they're the only ones with tusks.

00:39.886 --> 00:42.446
I got no problem telling
which one's the male, bro.

00:42.489 --> 00:44.616
Check out the fifth leg on that beast.

00:44.658 --> 00:46.182
It's called a trunk.

00:46.226 --> 00:48.922
It's called you're a spaz,
and that ain't what I'm talking about.

00:48.962 --> 00:51.692
Brock, be ready with your tranq gun
on my signal.

00:51.732 --> 00:53.290
Those two are going to be
bouncing off the walls...

00:53.333 --> 00:54.561
if they figure out where we are.

00:54.601 --> 00:57.434
Dr. Venture, you're right on time.

00:57.471 --> 01:00.201
My assistant, Mandalay,
is standing by to escort you...

01:00.240 --> 01:01.901
Um, yeah, OK, great.

01:01.942 --> 01:03.534
That'll be fine. Over and...

01:03.577 --> 01:05.909
And may I take this opportunity
to welcome you...

01:05.946 --> 01:08.608
- Oh, crap.
- To Brisbyland!

01:08.648 --> 01:10.707
Brisbyland!

02:04.070 --> 02:06.095
Brisbyland!

02:06.139 --> 02:07.401
This is gonna be phat city!

02:07.441 --> 02:09.636
I am all over that teacup ride!

02:09.675 --> 02:10.836
Boys, halt!

02:10.877 --> 02:12.811
You are "all over" no such thing.

02:12.846 --> 02:14.313
You're both to stay aboard the X-1.

02:14.347 --> 02:15.871
- What?
- Aw, weak!

02:15.916 --> 02:17.178
Weak, schmeak, Hank.

02:17.217 --> 02:18.684
We're here for business, not for fun.

02:18.718 --> 02:21.243
- But, Pop!
- What are you, on the rag?

02:22.456 --> 02:24.515
It's impossible for me to be on the rag.

02:24.558 --> 02:27.186
I'm a... I can't believe
I'm even arguing about this with you!

02:27.227 --> 02:30.390
What men's room did you pick up
that kind of trash talk in?

02:32.933 --> 02:37.370
Nice. Well, I was going to let you go on the
Runaway Shoe ride after my meeting...

02:37.404 --> 02:40.032
but you two just sassed
yourselves back on the X-1...

02:40.073 --> 02:41.802
so march!

02:43.410 --> 02:46.243
Ahh, look at this family values freakfest.

02:46.279 --> 02:49.146
This place is so squeaky clean,
it gives me the wicked jeebies.

02:49.182 --> 02:51.878
Hey, Pop... black guy.

02:54.254 --> 02:55.778
You must be Mandalay.

02:58.492 --> 03:00.289
I'm Dr. Thaddeus Venture.

03:00.327 --> 03:02.352
This is my bodyguard Brock.

03:03.663 --> 03:04.891
I, um...

03:04.931 --> 03:07.661
Have an appointment with Mr. Bris...

03:11.938 --> 03:13.200
Mute.

03:25.819 --> 03:28.344
Come in, Dr. Venture. Come.

03:28.388 --> 03:30.583
I'm afraid your man will have
to wait outside...

03:30.624 --> 03:33.616
while we discuss business, however.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.321
Easy, Brock. He's a cripple...

03:35.362 --> 03:37.455
and he's, like, 100.
What's gonna happen?

03:42.369 --> 03:48.069
Welcome, Dr. Venture,
to the funnest place on earth!

03:48.108 --> 03:50.576
Holy damn it Christmas!

03:56.249 --> 03:59.047
Does my appearance
startle you, Dr. Venture?

03:59.085 --> 04:00.848
No, not at all.

04:00.887 --> 04:04.721
I... as a man of science...
I see all kinds of things.

04:04.758 --> 04:10.060
Several years ago, I fell victim
to an animatronic accident here at the park.

04:10.096 --> 04:14.396
Trapped beneath an unstoppable
metal Lincoln for two hours.

04:14.434 --> 04:16.026
It's enough to give anyone a stroke.

04:16.069 --> 04:17.228
Well, you...

04:17.269 --> 04:18.930
Look like a million bucks.

04:18.971 --> 04:21.998
All thanks to this little bee.

04:23.009 --> 04:24.874
Panda's milk?

04:24.911 --> 04:28.540
Huh? Um, OK.

04:33.420 --> 04:36.912
One of the rarest beverages on earth,
and a natural elixir.

04:38.124 --> 04:39.819
It's actually not that disgusting.

04:39.859 --> 04:41.793
That noise is making
me nauseous, though.

04:41.828 --> 04:44.729
Oh, that?
That's just Li-Li enjoying her lunch.

04:44.764 --> 04:46.288
Li-Li?

04:46.333 --> 04:48.528
Yes, my longtime companda.

04:48.568 --> 04:51.128
I won her from David Bowie
in a trivia contest.

04:51.171 --> 04:56.006
This was 1980, '81 perhaps,
years before the big trivia craze...

04:56.042 --> 04:58.374
but then Bowie always was a trendsetter.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.984
Slippery Gulch sure looks fun from here.

05:06.019 --> 05:07.316
I spy...

05:07.354 --> 05:08.844
an antelope!

05:08.888 --> 05:12.051
They can run
up to forty-five miles per hour.

05:12.092 --> 05:14.219
Oh, this sucks!

05:14.260 --> 05:15.727
Why do we have to get stuck here...

05:15.762 --> 05:18.424
while Dad and Brock
get to tour Anna Bizzy Bee's head?

05:20.367 --> 05:21.891
So...

05:21.935 --> 05:23.493
how long you work for this guy?

05:27.040 --> 05:30.737
Now that we've exchanged pleasantries
and hot panda milk, Dr. Venture...

05:30.777 --> 05:32.972
let's talk business.

05:33.013 --> 05:35.038
I want you to clone me.

05:35.081 --> 05:36.571
Cloning?

05:36.616 --> 05:41.918
I wouldn't know anything about that,
seeing as Congress has banned...

05:41.955 --> 05:44.321
all cloning research in North America.

05:44.357 --> 05:46.222
Congress?

05:46.259 --> 05:49.285
Bunch of out-of-work astronauts
and C-list actors.

05:49.329 --> 05:52.890
They're not men of vision,
men like you and me.

05:52.932 --> 05:56.299
Men like... your father.

05:56.336 --> 05:59.703
Your father and I were
great friends, you know.

05:59.739 --> 06:02.367
In fact, he designed a number
of the rides and attractions...

06:02.409 --> 06:04.104
at the first Brisby theme park.

06:04.144 --> 06:07.204
You're probably too young to remember.

06:09.082 --> 06:10.674
Do I have to, Dad?

06:10.717 --> 06:13.413
You said you wanted to help Daddy, son.

06:16.256 --> 06:18.781
I vaguely remember him mentioning it.

06:18.825 --> 06:20.725
And I vaguely remember
him mentioning...

06:20.760 --> 06:22.887
he was dabbling in clone research.

06:22.929 --> 06:25.921
I'm willing to pay handsomely
for his notes alone.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.227
So...

06:27.267 --> 06:30.202
this is about him, then, not me.

06:30.236 --> 06:33.262
Well, I don't know if I've kept
any of Dad's old notes...

06:33.306 --> 06:36.139
Don't play coy with me.
Of course you kept them.

06:36.176 --> 06:39.441
You've been riding his corpse's coattails
your entire adult life.

06:39.479 --> 06:41.242
Hey! Where do you get off?

06:41.281 --> 06:42.441
You don't know me.

06:42.482 --> 06:44.780
Oh, I know you, Dr. Venture.

06:44.818 --> 06:47.150
My researchers are very thorough.

06:47.187 --> 06:50.156
For instance, you're not actually
a doctor of anything.

06:50.190 --> 06:52.784
You never finished school.

06:52.826 --> 06:55.624
I also know that since you took over
Venture Industries...

06:55.662 --> 06:58.893
profits have gone zippity-doo-dah.

06:58.932 --> 07:01.867
I... that's it!
The deal is off.

07:01.901 --> 07:03.198
I don't care if you are rich.

07:03.236 --> 07:05.204
I don't have to take
this crap from a gimp.

07:06.606 --> 07:10.804
Aw, now they're shooting off fireworks
over Smile Island. Unbelievable!

07:10.844 --> 07:12.334
I spy a...

07:14.481 --> 07:16.608
I don't have a card for that one.

07:16.649 --> 07:18.674
If you don't knock it off
with the wildlife cards already...

07:18.718 --> 07:21.482
you're going to be spying my foot
up your wow-hole, Dean.

07:21.521 --> 07:22.988
Seriously.

07:29.529 --> 07:33.329
So that's your final word, is it?

07:33.366 --> 07:35.596
Yes. Call me a golf cart, I'm leaving.

07:35.635 --> 07:38.103
- Now.
- Yes, now. I'm not spending another...

07:38.138 --> 07:41.107
- Now, damn it, now!
- Hey! What are you...

07:45.111 --> 07:46.578
You're all right.

07:49.182 --> 07:54.552
I spy a big, pink stinky,
who stinks, and he's stupid.

07:54.587 --> 07:55.815
That's it, pussy willow.

07:57.390 --> 07:59.290
My hair!

08:00.593 --> 08:03.187
Yeah, come on!
Come on. You gonna cry?

08:07.300 --> 08:09.268
Brock? Thank God!

08:09.302 --> 08:11.998
His freaking panda's
trained to put me in a bag!

08:12.038 --> 08:16.532
Why whatever is the matter,
Mr. Samson?

08:16.576 --> 08:18.168
Feeling woozy?

08:18.211 --> 08:21.544
Perhaps you should
cut down on your smoking.

08:21.581 --> 08:23.947
You'd be surprised
at the amount of chemicals...

08:23.983 --> 08:26.713
the average cigarette contains.

08:26.753 --> 08:28.948
Chloral hydrate.

08:30.924 --> 08:33.620
That didn't sound good.

08:35.428 --> 08:37.453
Those things'll kill ya!

08:40.600 --> 08:43.967
Mandalay!
Help me! I've come aflame again!

08:49.409 --> 08:50.569
It's gonna snap!

08:50.610 --> 08:53.238
- I can't hold it!
- All right! Knock it off!

08:53.279 --> 08:55.247
You are so lucky I had milk earlier.

08:55.281 --> 08:56.578
Uh-oh, there it goes.

08:56.616 --> 08:59.016
Uncle!

09:08.061 --> 09:13.021
I admit that was a bit theatrical,
Dr. Venture...

09:13.066 --> 09:15.864
but if there's one thing
cartoons have taught me...

09:15.902 --> 09:17.927
it's that one can never be too careful.

09:17.971 --> 09:19.529
Your panda broke my glasses.

09:19.572 --> 09:21.540
We'll replace them at once.

09:21.574 --> 09:23.405
We have many glasses here.

09:23.443 --> 09:25.707
We have everything you need.

09:25.745 --> 09:26.939
Where the hell is here?

09:26.980 --> 09:29.540
Your home for the time being.

09:29.582 --> 09:34.713
Welcome, Dr. Venture,
to the Brisby-dome!

09:36.089 --> 09:40.150
This is that ridiculous giant beehive
next door to your study, isn't it?

09:40.193 --> 09:46.325
You knocked me out and put me in a bag
to bring me fifty yards?

09:46.866 --> 09:48.163
Samson.

09:56.142 --> 09:58.167
Pretty.

09:58.211 --> 10:01.942
Samson, you are still with us?

10:01.981 --> 10:06.111
You know I would never
let anyone kill my Samson.

10:06.152 --> 10:09.610
Molotov Cocktease.

10:09.655 --> 10:11.748
That is my job.

10:13.559 --> 10:15.186
We only wanted your plane.

10:15.228 --> 10:18.129
We have no intention of hurting you, boys.

10:18.164 --> 10:19.688
Are you comfortable?

10:19.732 --> 10:21.222
Do you want more juice?

10:21.267 --> 10:22.859
Debbie, give the Venture boys more juice.

10:22.902 --> 10:25.097
- Where are we?
- And what do you want with us?

10:25.138 --> 10:26.799
You're in the gymnasium...

10:26.839 --> 10:28.739
at the Orange County
Community College...

10:28.774 --> 10:32.335
and you're being held hostage
by the Orange County Liberation Front.

10:32.378 --> 10:33.640
Free O. C!

10:35.848 --> 10:38.043
Well, our dad has a strict policy...

10:38.084 --> 10:40.382
never to negotiate with terrorists
for our lives...

10:40.419 --> 10:42.011
so you're wasting your time.

10:42.054 --> 10:43.646
We're not terrorists!

10:43.689 --> 10:45.122
We're normal folks...

10:45.158 --> 10:48.059
men and women with jobs
and homes and families.

10:48.094 --> 10:49.721
Oh, that's me.

10:49.762 --> 10:51.753
I gotta go.
Peggy's going into labor.

10:53.633 --> 10:56.568
That's great, Todd.
Give her my best.

10:56.602 --> 11:01.039
What do you two know about the man
your father is working for?

11:01.073 --> 11:02.734
Well, duh!

11:02.775 --> 11:04.504
He's Roy Brisby...

11:04.544 --> 11:07.342
the guy that makes all those
great Bizzy Bee cartoons.

11:07.380 --> 11:08.574
Where have you been?

11:08.614 --> 11:12.710
He is the devil in the flesh, and that
animated abomination he created...

11:12.752 --> 11:15.721
is the angel of death
bringing darkness to this world!

11:17.557 --> 11:20.754
Won't you reconsider, Dr. Venture?

11:20.793 --> 11:24.752
Brisbyland was but a prelude,
the next step...

11:24.797 --> 11:26.094
is Brisby life!

11:26.132 --> 11:28.157
And this Brisby-dome is the model.

11:28.201 --> 11:31.193
The perfect society in the Brisby mold.

11:31.237 --> 11:36.869
Safe, clean, self-sufficient,
and for the mere price of a simple clone...

11:36.909 --> 11:39.241
you, too, can be a part of it.

11:39.278 --> 11:42.907
Get it straight, you cadaver on wheels,
I'm not working for you...

11:42.949 --> 11:45.918
and I'm not staying
in your crappy Brisby-dome.

11:45.952 --> 11:47.283
Did you forget about "no"?

11:47.320 --> 11:53.088
I need you to clone me, Dr. Venture,
that I might live to see my dream fulfilled.

11:53.125 --> 11:57.221
This dried old husk of mine
might be broken and used up...

11:57.263 --> 12:03.168
but my brain is as alert and alive
as the day I scribbled my first...

12:03.202 --> 12:04.601
Bizzy Bee.

12:07.707 --> 12:09.174
Now I see.

12:09.208 --> 12:12.109
You know, it took me a minute,
but I just got it.

12:12.144 --> 12:15.079
Got it? So you'll come aboard?

12:15.114 --> 12:16.274
Oh, no, no, no.

12:16.315 --> 12:20.479
What I just got is that you're like
a total jacked up freaky-deaky crazypants.

12:21.887 --> 12:23.855
I see.

12:23.889 --> 12:25.652
Mandalay!

12:25.691 --> 12:27.249
No! Brock!

12:27.293 --> 12:28.555
Come in, Br...

12:31.731 --> 12:36.100
I built an empire on the back
of a cartoon bee, Venture.

12:36.135 --> 12:38.695
Did you really think
I'd allow you...

12:43.276 --> 12:44.504
You OK, sir?

12:44.543 --> 12:47.740
This is what you call
wheelchair accessible?

13:01.594 --> 13:04.222
How long has it been, Samson?

13:04.263 --> 13:05.628
Three years, forty-eight days.

13:05.665 --> 13:06.825
Ah, yes.

13:06.866 --> 13:08.527
Prague, wasn't it?

13:08.567 --> 13:10.000
Or was it Lisbon?

13:10.036 --> 13:12.334
- Akron.
- Of course.

13:12.371 --> 13:14.839
Laser Zeppelin at the planetarium.

13:22.748 --> 13:25.080
However did you survive the fall?

13:25.117 --> 13:28.052
Landed in a dump truck
full of circus peanuts.

13:43.469 --> 13:45.403
You killed my father!

13:45.438 --> 13:46.905
After you killed my partner.

13:46.939 --> 13:49.407
You took my eye.

13:49.442 --> 13:51.535
After you took...

13:51.577 --> 13:52.976
my heart.

14:00.820 --> 14:01.980
Nyet!

14:02.021 --> 14:05.047
You know I can only go to second base.

14:05.091 --> 14:06.581
Still?

14:06.625 --> 14:09.321
After all these years?

14:11.397 --> 14:13.831
I thought the Cold War was over!

14:15.368 --> 14:18.235
It's always cold in Siberia.

14:26.979 --> 14:28.606
You want one of these?

14:41.594 --> 14:43.994
I got to go take care of something.

14:44.029 --> 14:48.227
I ask you,
what honey does Bizzy Bee produce?

14:48.267 --> 14:49.734
Destruction!

14:49.769 --> 14:52.203
I think you must be mistaken.

14:52.238 --> 14:53.398
See?

14:53.439 --> 14:55.907
This is Bizzy Bee.
He's really cute.

14:55.941 --> 14:57.772
I have his lunchbox,
too, and all the toys...

14:57.810 --> 14:58.970
Get that thing out of my sight!

15:00.012 --> 15:01.639
I hate that damn bee!

15:01.680 --> 15:02.977
Kill the bee!

15:04.283 --> 15:05.443
But I like him.

15:05.484 --> 15:08.351
He's devoured Orange County
bit by bit to make way...

15:08.387 --> 15:10.014
for the ever-expanding Brisbyland.

15:10.055 --> 15:12.455
The site where his new
Brisby-dome now stands...

15:12.491 --> 15:14.789
was once a beautiful
residential neighborhood...

15:14.827 --> 15:16.624
with a very convenient shopping mall.

15:16.662 --> 15:19.153
- Don't forget the skate park.
- A skate park, too. Right.

15:19.198 --> 15:21.496
Chad here used to be
a professional skater.

15:21.534 --> 15:23.331
There was also a very
pleasant Applebee's.

15:23.369 --> 15:26.770
- Ted and I met at that Applebee's...
- Debbie and I met at that Applebee's!

15:26.806 --> 15:30.435
Do you see what that bee has done
to our beloved county?

15:30.476 --> 15:32.068
And it's not just here!

15:32.111 --> 15:36.070
Brisby's cartoon cancer
has already spread to Florida...

15:36.115 --> 15:40.017
where we're loosely affiliated
with the Sunshine State Freedom Front.

15:40.052 --> 15:41.747
Loosely. Those people
are weird down there.

15:41.787 --> 15:44.620
Eurobrisby has gained
a foothold in France.

15:44.657 --> 15:46.352
Times Square has fallen.

15:46.392 --> 15:48.155
Where is it going to end?

15:48.194 --> 15:49.991
Well, I'll tell you where.

15:50.029 --> 15:55.126
Right here, right now,
with the help of Bizzy Bee himself.

15:55.167 --> 15:57.397
It's our Bizzy Bee Club hats!

15:57.436 --> 16:00.633
No. These were stolen
from Brisbycorp headquarters...

16:00.673 --> 16:02.140
last week by one of our agents.

16:02.174 --> 16:03.971
They're prototypes.

16:04.009 --> 16:05.738
Aw, super-new Bizzy Bee Club hats!

16:05.778 --> 16:07.973
- Neat! Do they light up?
- No!

16:08.013 --> 16:12.473
According to Brisbycorp internal memos,
they were intended for mind control.

16:12.518 --> 16:15.783
Still think your little Bizzy Bee is cute?

16:17.056 --> 16:18.318
Good.

16:18.357 --> 16:21.622
Then you two will make
the perfect test subjects.

16:24.864 --> 16:27.162
The truth serum should've
taken effect by now.

16:28.300 --> 16:31.667
It's time to learn
what Dr. Venture knows about cloning.

16:31.704 --> 16:35.572
Mandalay, wake him. Now.

16:37.409 --> 16:39.639
State your name.

16:39.678 --> 16:41.839
Reading from top to bottom...

16:41.881 --> 16:43.371
Lisa.

16:43.415 --> 16:45.383
Carol.

16:45.417 --> 16:46.941
Freemont.

16:50.055 --> 16:51.352
He's telling the truth.

16:51.390 --> 16:54.689
Anyway, it wasn't Brisby
who took the boys.

16:54.727 --> 16:57.025
It was some sort of revolutionary group.

16:57.062 --> 16:58.359
Just a minute.

17:05.271 --> 17:07.704
Know where the boys are?

17:07.740 --> 17:09.298
What do we want?

17:09.340 --> 17:10.933
Free O. C!

17:11.944 --> 17:13.104
What are we gonna do?

17:13.145 --> 17:14.510
Kill the bee!

17:22.788 --> 17:25.723
Jeez, Ted,
those hats really worked.

17:25.758 --> 17:27.988
Did you turn them all the way up
to "Patty Hearst"?

17:28.027 --> 17:31.861
Orange County Liberation Front,
we are ready.

17:31.897 --> 17:34.991
We attack Brisbyland tonight!

17:38.871 --> 17:40.099
Ted, wait.

17:40.139 --> 17:43.506
I did the Liberation Front's chart,
and tonight is actually a great night...

17:43.542 --> 17:45.032
to launch a new project for us.

17:45.077 --> 17:46.942
That's great, hon, but we have to...

17:46.979 --> 17:50.278
Plus, "Cosmo" says
orange is this year's black.

17:50.316 --> 17:52.181
That's got to be a good sign, right?

17:55.054 --> 17:58.717
All clear, sir.
Brad and I will follow in his van. Over.

17:58.757 --> 18:00.725
Your bag has snaps.

18:00.759 --> 18:02.283
Mine has velcro.
Look at this.

18:02.328 --> 18:04.558
Yeah, you got one of the new ones.

18:04.597 --> 18:06.064
I got mine back in '9...

18:24.883 --> 18:26.145
You know this robot?

18:27.286 --> 18:28.583
Wait a minute.

18:28.621 --> 18:32.182
If I summon him, he'll override
the X-1's controls and bring her back here.

18:32.224 --> 18:33.987
He's programmed to come
when we call him.

18:39.965 --> 18:41.899
Back to my car.
I know where they're going.

18:41.934 --> 18:46.200
I've always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

18:46.238 --> 18:48.035
This is ridiculous.

18:48.073 --> 18:49.973
We're not getting anything
useful out of him, sir.

18:50.009 --> 18:53.342
This serum must be interacting
with something in his system.

18:53.379 --> 18:55.643
The man is a pill-popper, after all.

18:56.782 --> 18:58.613
Mandalay!
What's happening?

18:58.651 --> 18:59.811
Oh, mercy.

18:59.852 --> 19:03.117
Which one of you strapping young bucks
will catch my fall?

19:04.390 --> 19:07.120
Jiminy Crickets!
Do something!

19:16.602 --> 19:18.467
Move, move, move.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.772
See if you can locate Dr. Venture.

19:25.811 --> 19:27.039
I'll look for the boys.

19:27.079 --> 19:28.512
Nyet, Samson.

19:28.547 --> 19:30.811
I have my own mission to attend to.

19:30.849 --> 19:33.147
What? What about helping me?

19:33.185 --> 19:35.813
I help only my client.

19:35.854 --> 19:38.823
Did you forget?
I'm a mercenary.

19:46.365 --> 19:48.833
Rally, Orange County Liberation Front!

19:48.867 --> 19:50.630
Rally!

19:55.374 --> 19:58.309
What the hell is going on out here?

20:23.469 --> 20:25.164
Thank you, Brock.

20:26.238 --> 20:29.071
Yo, I just work here, man,
and I don't even need this job no more.

20:32.444 --> 20:34.241
Die, Brisby scum!

20:37.082 --> 20:38.640
Listen, boys.

20:38.684 --> 20:40.242
Put down the firearms.

20:40.285 --> 20:41.912
Kill the bee!

20:47.793 --> 20:49.055
We're under attack!

20:49.094 --> 20:52.427
Have my private jet ready to fly
to Florida immediately!

20:52.464 --> 20:53.726
We're moving the operation to...

20:54.800 --> 20:57.200
You know what I'm here for, Brisby.

20:57.236 --> 21:00.637
Turn it over and you
don't have to die tonight.

21:06.278 --> 21:08.678
You don't want to shoot me, boys.

21:08.714 --> 21:10.113
You know me.

21:10.149 --> 21:12.845
You know what I'll do to you if you do.

21:12.885 --> 21:14.512
KilI...

21:14.553 --> 21:15.986
the...

21:16.021 --> 21:17.181
bee?

21:19.725 --> 21:22.250
What'd you do that for, Brock?

21:22.294 --> 21:24.319
Hello? Anyone?

21:24.363 --> 21:25.625
- Hey, Daddy!
- Hey, Pop!

21:25.664 --> 21:27.996
Hello, boys. Brock!
You think you could help me out here?

21:28.033 --> 21:29.523
I'm starting to black out.

21:29.568 --> 21:31.695
Hey, wait a minute.

21:31.737 --> 21:34.103
We're in Brisbyland!

21:34.139 --> 21:36.664
Oh, you're the best daddy ever, Pop!

21:36.708 --> 21:38.767
Go Team Venture!

21:38.811 --> 21:40.108
Yes, yes...

22:10.342 --> 22:12.207
All went according to plan.

22:12.244 --> 22:14.109
There were no complications.

22:14.146 --> 22:19.516
The threat has been neutralized
and your package has been secured...

22:19.551 --> 22:21.451
Mr. Bowie.

22:21.486 --> 22:24.819
That's good soup!
