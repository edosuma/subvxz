as the soul beneficiary

00:27.300 --> 00:30.134
and the official executor

Wait a second.

00:47.134 --> 00:50.008
So, the guy who just
kicked me out of my house

00:50.008 --> 00:52.467
now owns 10%
of my company?

00:52.467 --> 00:54.676
Technically, he kicked you
out of his  house.

00:54.676 --> 00:57.758
And he inherited all
of Mr. Bachman's assets

00:57.758 --> 01:00.758

of Pied Piper.

Look, Richie.

01:04.509 --> 01:07.384
You didn't actually
lose anything here, okay?

01:07.384 --> 01:09.800
Bachman is
the aggrieved party,

01:09.800 --> 01:11.634
and if he is actually
still alive,

01:11.634 --> 01:14.092
he'll get his 10% back
when he shows up.

is it really any worse

You don't have, like, a bias

01:27.842 --> 01:30.300
Richard?
No, I don't.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.717
No, I just don't like being
kicked out of my house.

Hey!

01:50.758 --> 01:52.551
Dana, this is
Richard Hendricks.

01:52.551 --> 01:54.676
He's the CEO
of Pied Piper.

01:54.676 --> 01:55.758
And, Richard,

01:55.758 --> 01:58.384
this is Dana,
CEO of Quiver.
Oh, yeah.

01:58.384 --> 02:01.217
Yeah, I hear you guys
are giving Akami
a run for their money.

02:01.217 --> 02:03.217
Oh, yeah.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.634
Dana and I kept
finding ourselves

02:06.634 --> 02:09.342
on the same bathroom
schedule back at Hooli.

02:09.342 --> 02:11.259
You know, men
and their cycles.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.008
Jared: You know what?

02:17.008 --> 02:20.050
You guys should
get a meal together.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.134
Jared: Right? You're--
you're kindred spirits.

02:22.134 --> 02:23.967
You're both CEOs.
You have a lot in common.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.259
Sure, yeah. Maybe. Yep.

02:25.259 --> 02:27.426
Well, Richard, you're free
tomorrow night.

02:27.426 --> 02:28.883
But I'm not.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.092
I have a big party
at my house.

02:31.092 --> 02:33.092
A lot of people
I don't know.

02:33.092 --> 02:34.467
So, see ya!

02:39.676 --> 02:40.800
What was that?

02:40.800 --> 02:43.217
I don't need you
to make friends for me.

02:43.217 --> 02:44.758
Oh, I just think
you could benefit

02:44.758 --> 02:46.259
from a friendship
with someone like Dana,

02:46.259 --> 02:47.676
who's so much like yourself.

02:47.676 --> 02:50.758
Like me?
You think that guy's like me?

02:53.509 --> 02:54.467
I just thought of something.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.050
Do you guys want
to come to my party?

02:56.050 --> 02:58.634
Dana, that's
so gracious of you.

02:58.634 --> 03:00.800
That would be delightful.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.967
Okay, bye.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.134
Mm-kay.

03:06.259 --> 03:08.551
You don't see it?

03:08.551 --> 03:10.300
It's uncanny.

03:22.509 --> 03:24.134
Look at this.
This is what they're asking

03:24.134 --> 03:26.300
for a one-bedroom
apartment in Menlo Park.

03:27.426 --> 03:28.634
Oh.

03:28.634 --> 03:30.092
What?

03:30.092 --> 03:32.467
Well, I can
comfortably afford

03:32.467 --> 03:34.467
my new one-bedroom apartment.

03:34.467 --> 03:38.050
You and I make
the same amount of money.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.842
I'm just wondering,
what is the difference?

03:40.842 --> 03:43.259
Could it be that
I didn't spend all my money

03:43.259 --> 03:45.676
on an absurdly
over

03:45.676 --> 03:47.092
Richard:
Gilfoyle!

03:47.092 --> 03:49.092
So kind of you to join us.

03:49.092 --> 03:51.008
You're welcome.

03:51.008 --> 03:53.050
Yeah! Uh, well,
it's, uh, 2:00 PM.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.300
So, fourth day in a row
you missed the stand-up meeting.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.676
Correct.

03:56.676 --> 03:58.342
Maybe you should
hold it later.

03:58.342 --> 04:00.509
Okay, 'cause we
literally moved it

04:00.509 --> 04:02.758
from 9:00 to 11:00
to accommodate you.

04:02.758 --> 04:06.300
So do you mind telling us
when you feel like
you can make it in?

04:06.300 --> 04:08.300
Sure. Whenever
you hold the meeting,

04:08.300 --> 04:11.050
I'll be in an hour after that.
Okay, well--

04:12.134 --> 04:15.050
Richard:
What the fuck was that?

04:15.050 --> 04:19.300
Uh, that's the song
"You Suffer" by Napalm Death.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.008
Oh, yeah? That's--
that's a whole song?
That's like a second.

04:22.008 --> 04:23.300
It's an alert.

04:23.300 --> 04:27.008
Whenever the price of Bitcoin
dips below a certain value,

04:27.008 --> 04:29.008
it's no longer
efficient to mine.

04:29.008 --> 04:30.967
When it comes back up,
it is.

04:30.967 --> 04:33.259
So, I need to know
when it breaks that threshold,

04:33.259 --> 04:35.217
so that I can remotely
toggle my rig at home.

04:35.217 --> 04:39.008
Okay. Any idea how often
that might happen?

04:39.008 --> 04:41.467
Bitcoin is very volatile.

04:41.467 --> 04:42.925
So...

04:42.925 --> 04:45.134
That's just so loud.

04:45.134 --> 04:48.050
A lot.
Good.
Alright, well...

04:48.050 --> 04:49.717
maybe turn it down
or something?

04:49.717 --> 04:51.842
Richard: Oh, fuck.

04:53.217 --> 04:56.050
What's up?
You guys working hard
or hardly working?

04:56.050 --> 04:58.384
'Sup?

05:00.217 --> 05:03.050
Hey, buds.
How's it going?

05:04.259 --> 05:06.592

Bay Area rents, huh?

05:06.592 --> 05:08.050
High AF.

05:08.050 --> 05:10.551

to live by himself,

05:10.551 --> 05:12.509
or lady, by herself?

05:12.509 --> 05:15.175
Especially on an everyman
coder's salary, you feel me?

05:15.175 --> 05:18.008
Are you offering us
a cost of living raise?
Nope!

05:18.008 --> 05:20.175
Not at all. Even better.

05:20.175 --> 05:22.426
If one of you dudes
is strapped for cash,

05:22.426 --> 05:23.676
do you a solid.

05:23.676 --> 05:26.092
Move in, split the rent
"fiddy-fiddy."

05:26.092 --> 05:30.092
Or, 40/"siddy" depending on
square footage of bedrooms.

05:30.092 --> 05:32.175
Come on! Think about it!

05:32.175 --> 05:33.175
Jazzy Jeff!

05:33.175 --> 05:34.300

05:38.217 --> 05:40.050

05:40.050 --> 05:41.758
Yes, I-I have a room.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.300

evaluation will get you.

topic of conversation
for you and Dana.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.467
Dana!
Oh, hey.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.259
You're just standing there.

Hey, yeah.

06:11.509 --> 06:13.509

like your place.

06:13.509 --> 06:15.634
Yeah, me too.

06:15.634 --> 06:18.175
Well, he liked it,
so he bought it.

06:18.175 --> 06:20.300
Right? Just like you
and that hoodie.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.634
So, Dana,
interesting story.

06:22.634 --> 06:25.342
Uh, the reason Richard has
this bandage on his neck,

06:25.342 --> 06:27.259
and that he's got
one on his hand,

06:27.259 --> 06:29.925
is because he got so exhausted
during a code sprint,

06:29.925 --> 06:32.134
that he walked through
a plate-glass window.

06:32.134 --> 06:34.842
Now, I-I read on Pando
that you got injured also

06:34.842 --> 06:35.883

06:35.883 --> 06:37.342

06:48.676 --> 06:51.800

Sorry, I'm, uh,
Ben Burkhardt.

08:11.717 --> 08:13.175
I'm-- I'm Dana's COO.

08:13.175 --> 08:15.800
Dana told me he invited you.
I'm so psyched you came!

08:15.800 --> 08:17.758
Yeah.
I got-- I have so many
questions for you, man.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.800
Do you want to grab a drink
or do you want to stay here?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.551
There. Yeah.
Oh, great.

08:27.134 --> 08:30.175
I mean, even way back when
I was finishing my PhD at MIT,

08:30.175 --> 08:31.551
I would tell anyone
that would listen

08:31.551 --> 08:33.967
that a decentralized system
was the obvious eventuality.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.384
Yep.
And now it's more necessary
than ever.

08:36.384 --> 08:38.676
I mean, the stuff
Google and Facebook
are getting away with.

08:38.676 --> 08:39.925
It's insane. Totally.
Right?

08:39.925 --> 08:41.676
That's why I've always said
that the user's data

08:41.676 --> 08:43.134
should be in the hands
of consumers,

08:43.134 --> 08:44.259
not the corporations.

08:44.259 --> 08:46.217
100%, but see,
that can't happen,

08:46.217 --> 08:48.467
until someone iterates
a functional alternative.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.634
Which, I believe, Richard,

08:50.634 --> 08:51.717
I believe you're about to do.

08:51.717 --> 08:54.342
Well, I don't know.
Trying to, yeah.

08:54.342 --> 08:57.008
Have you solved, uh,
co-locating data
with the compute test?

08:58.092 --> 08:59.467
How do you know about that?

08:59.467 --> 09:01.175
Do you code?
I used to, man.

09:01.175 --> 09:02.592
Uh, yeah, I loved it so much,

09:02.592 --> 09:05.676
but, you know, I got drawn
over to the business side.

09:05.676 --> 09:07.134
Jared:
Richard!

09:07.134 --> 09:08.259
There you are!

Hey. Jared Dunn.
Hi! Ben Burkhardt.

09:09.842 --> 09:12.217
Hey, Dana.
So, it's 9:00 AM in Dubai.

09:12.217 --> 09:14.217
I gotta make a call,
so, excuse me, guys.

09:14.217 --> 09:15.925
Oh.

09:15.925 --> 09:17.592
So, um, Dana
was just telling me

09:17.592 --> 09:19.551
that he prefers
a late lunch, too.

09:19.551 --> 09:20.883
Just like...

09:22.008 --> 09:23.467
Is that right?

09:23.467 --> 09:25.175

So, on the way out,
Dana told me

09:39.883 --> 09:41.509

meeting you.

09:41.509 --> 09:42.634
He said it went great!

09:44.092 --> 09:45.426
Did you not think so?

09:45.426 --> 09:48.592
Yeah, it's just...
he didn't really talk, though.

09:48.592 --> 09:50.676
Yeah.
That's one of his quirks.

09:50.676 --> 09:51.925

Hey, you know who I did
have a good conversation with?

09:54.175 --> 09:55.883
Who?
His COO.

09:55.883 --> 09:57.300
Who, Ben?

09:57.300 --> 09:59.342
Yeah, um, do you know him?

09:59.342 --> 10:01.008
Um, not well.

10:01.008 --> 10:03.967
I hear he's a very
competent executive.

10:03.967 --> 10:06.551

he left Oculus for Quiver

10:06.551 --> 10:08.217

unprofessional manner.

Pied Piper.

Back there, we test our
compressor run capacitors.

But here is what I'm sure
you'll be most interested
in seeing.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.967
This is our smart fridge
development team.

11:43.967 --> 11:46.467
To be honest,
we were a little nervous

11:46.467 --> 11:48.967
about wading into the
Internet-enabled market.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.467
Over the last 80 years,

11:50.467 --> 11:52.300
we've built a real trust
with our customers.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.800
Alright! Great tour!

11:53.800 --> 11:55.717
Oh, there's a lot more to see.

11:55.717 --> 11:57.842
Ugh. Why? Look.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.634
I came here to offer you
a partnership

11:59.634 --> 12:01.050
to cut down your server bills.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.342
Oh!

12:02.342 --> 12:04.842
Well, our server costs
were far higher

12:04.842 --> 12:06.384
than we anticipated.

12:06.384 --> 12:08.509
As we said,
we're not well versed in--

12:08.509 --> 12:10.676
The 20th century?
Yeah, you mentioned that.

12:10.676 --> 12:12.883

a fortune or not?

12:12.883 --> 12:14.008
Well, yes.

12:14.008 --> 12:16.008
In exchange, I need you
to do something for me

12:16.008 --> 12:18.758
with regard to the people
who hacked your refrigerators.

12:18.758 --> 12:21.008
I'm going to destroy
their lives.

So, what?
Ben: So...

12:23.883 --> 12:25.842
So, I turned
to Bill Gates...
Yeah?

12:25.842 --> 12:27.175
Right, and I said...

12:27.175 --> 12:30.092
"I don't know, Bill.
Maybe you should Google it."

12:30.092 --> 12:32.175
You said that to Bill Gates?

12:32.175 --> 12:33.883
I did! I swear.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.842
Hey...

12:36.842 --> 12:39.467
can I ask you, um...

12:39.467 --> 12:43.217
Did you tell Dana
that we were having lunch?

12:43.217 --> 12:45.800
Richard, I told you
that Bill Gates story
for a reason.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.800
I, um, I practice something
called "radical candor."

12:48.800 --> 12:51.717
Which is no matter how
uncomfortable the truth is,

12:51.717 --> 12:52.800
I'm gonna tell it to you.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.342
And the honest truth is...

12:55.342 --> 12:57.717
I did not tell Dana
about this lunch.

12:59.092 --> 13:01.967
Things with Dana
have gotten stagnant.

13:01.967 --> 13:04.342
But the other night...

13:04.342 --> 13:06.217
talking to you, Richard, I--

13:06.217 --> 13:08.175
I felt that spark again.

13:08.175 --> 13:10.509
What are you saying?
Okay, well.

13:10.509 --> 13:11.883
The first tenet
of rad-can, Richard,

13:11.883 --> 13:13.967
is to just-- is to just
say what you think,

13:13.967 --> 13:15.842
and so I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna say what I think,

13:15.842 --> 13:17.551
and, Richard, I think
we should work together.

13:17.551 --> 13:20.509
Oh. You mean, like...?

13:20.509 --> 13:22.758
Like, I could be your COO.

Um...

No, we don't even
have a laptop.

Exactly! 'Cause we're
not doing anything wrong.
Oh, shit!

Shit.
