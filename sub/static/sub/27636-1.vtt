01:28.087 --> 01:31.759
It was destiny that brought
the great Sherlock Holmes into my life.

01:31.924 --> 01:37.430
That fateful day, I met the finest,
most compassionate, most beautiful man

01:37.847 --> 01:39.766
I would ever have the honor to know.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.310
You look radiant
this morning, my darling.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.479
Green and proud.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.483
Not a blemish on your perfect skin.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.903
You beautiful, green, succulent bitch...

01:50.986 --> 01:54.364
I first met him after my return
from the Afghan War.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.950
The war had left me
with a broken leg and a broken spirit.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.494
I was in dire straits.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.037
Do you like this?

02:03.581 --> 02:06.459
I was going to end it all,
but that terrible moment...

02:06.543 --> 02:07.544
Goodbye, life.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.961
...became the greatest of my life.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.545
You unforgiving turd.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.674
He saw I was about jump to my death.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.468
- Don't do it!
- And he immediately tried to stop me.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.469
Get out of the way. I'm going to jump.

02:17.054 --> 02:20.140
Jump into that garden over there.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.308
Are you telling me not to jump?

02:22.391 --> 02:24.936
There are many other ways
you could kill yourself.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.605
We had instant connection.

02:26.687 --> 02:28.439
This man cares about me.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.150
A little cup of poison.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.404
- Dead.
- He gave me a reason to live.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.487
Yes, we'll go and have a drink.

02:34.570 --> 02:39.909
I will get my gun
and fill your heart full of bullets.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.830
Yes, right in the heart.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.915
It's crazy, but I love you, too.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.960
He was a man of great compassion.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.212
I'm losing patience with you.

02:50.294 --> 02:53.381
You're right.
Life really is worth living. I...

02:56.092 --> 02:57.468
No, no, no!

02:58.679 --> 02:59.805
No!

03:01.473 --> 03:03.225
You saved me. I'm alive.

03:03.307 --> 03:05.394
Your giant vegetable saved me.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.312
- Don't... Yes.
- Thank you, my new friend.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.147
- Please not...
- I'm in your debt forever.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.566
Please don't destroy any more of it.

03:11.775 --> 03:12.985
Oh, God.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.486
It has been my honor...

03:14.569 --> 03:16.362
- John Watson.
- Yes. Hi.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.407
- ...ever since.
- Sherlock Holmes.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.989
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

03:59.073 --> 04:01.241
Moriarty's crime spree over!

04:01.324 --> 04:04.994
Professor James Moriarty
faces justice today!

04:05.079 --> 04:07.581
The Napoleon of crime on trial!

04:07.663 --> 04:09.832
Greatest criminal in the empire!

04:09.917 --> 04:10.918
That's fake news.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.962
Professor James Moriarty.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.757
You have been the organizer
of half that is evil

04:16.839 --> 04:20.218
and all that goes undetected
in this great city.

04:21.177 --> 04:25.389
Today, you are charged
with murder in the first degree,

04:25.557 --> 04:28.769
but all the witnesses have died.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.856
Without said witnesses,
we have no choice but to set you free.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.362
Inspector Lestrade,

04:39.446 --> 04:42.366
you simply must take
better care of your witnesses.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.161
Mark my words,

04:47.329 --> 04:49.706
Sherlock Holmes is on his way,
and with him,

04:49.872 --> 04:52.543
the evidence that will damn you
to the noose.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.170
Then we should all pray he arrives soon,

04:55.254 --> 04:58.966
for on the strike of noon,
I shall have to release this menace.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.550
Sherlock will be here.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.179
He is about to burst
through those doors right now.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.814
Stop this trial at once!

05:14.105 --> 05:19.610
I, Sherlock Holmes, have solved the case
of Professor James Moriarty.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.406
Wonderful. Wonderful, Holmes.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.116
A dramatic entrance worthy
of your greatest achievement.

05:25.199 --> 05:30.663
Watson, did you notice my emphasis
on "Professor James Moriarty"?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.081
Yes, with the finger, yes.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.584
- Much better than the hand.
- Yes.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.669
Instead of the karate chop,
I went to the index finger.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.088
Yes, it's the best one yet.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.132
This is the moment
everyone's been waiting for.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.215
Right here.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.343
Yes, and they're literally
waiting for it now.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.096
- Oh, yes.
- You must get dressed.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.389
- Yes?
- Very well.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.057
There we are. There are your things.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.225
- Remember, trial of the century.
- Yes.

05:51.310 --> 05:53.353
We have but... Let's see now...

05:53.437 --> 05:55.189
Just 16 minutes left, Holmes.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.731
Speed is of the essence.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.983
- Nearly there?
- Nearly there.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.986
A sniff of morning cocaine
always helps the brain.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.949
Come now, Sherlock.
You mustn't let that trial conclude.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.495
For this occasion,
I have selected a new hat.

06:09.577 --> 06:13.206
From now on, when people utter
the name "Sherlock Holmes,"

06:13.290 --> 06:14.540
they will picture...

06:15.041 --> 06:16.209
This.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.838
Brilliant.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.255
Can we go?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.424
Your furrowed brow
betrays your lying lips.

06:23.509 --> 06:24.802
Oh, no.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.261
Not to worry.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.723
Hey there, cowboy.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.725
- That's the one.
- Bang, bang.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.268
We should leave, yes?

06:33.935 --> 06:35.061
Aye, aye.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.855
I say, I like that one very much.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.191
You don't want to be late, Mr. Holmes.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.735
Mrs. Hudson,
what do you think of this one?

06:42.860 --> 06:43.986
Me?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.698
I'm just a housekeeper
from the Glasgow slums.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.534
The likes of me telling the likes of you

06:49.617 --> 06:51.245
what to put on his noggin?

06:51.327 --> 06:52.495
Good point.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.456
Back to your monkey work, Hudson.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.253
- Perfect, right?
- May I show you a few more hats?

07:00.336 --> 07:02.046
- No!
- Someone's left a wee box.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.339
What are you going on about?

07:03.423 --> 07:06.217
I never even heard anyone knocking.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.760
Did you hear anything?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.221
How very queer.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.474
Queerer and queerer.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.102
Very odd.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.355
Watson, no.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.065
Holmes, why are you getting
so exercised?

07:21.149 --> 07:22.692
It's merely an empty box.

07:23.444 --> 07:27.197
Watson, this is sent from Moriarty.
He means to kill us.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.031
Listen.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.369
Shut that window.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.204
If this winged menace escapes,
it may cause a pandemic.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.497
A killer mosquito?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.625
The insect is infected
with African plague.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.377
One bite means death.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.296
Now, dance a Dutch jig.

07:46.716 --> 07:50.678
You don't have to ask me twice
to do a Dutch jig, but why?

07:50.762 --> 07:53.431
Your body heat will attract him
to dine on your flesh.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.640
Brilliant.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.186
Hold! Don't move.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.103
- Where is it?
- Right there.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.855
Right there on your forehead.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.775
- Kill it, Holmes.
- I'm going to kill it.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.943
- There it is. Don't move.
- Where?

08:06.028 --> 08:07.946
- And hold. No.
- No, no, no.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.115
No, hold.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.200
Is it biting?

08:14.452 --> 08:15.495
I hear it.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.665
I see it.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.086
The tip!

08:23.629 --> 08:25.047
Don't worry, boys, I brought a net.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.808
It is now seven minutes before noon.

08:37.893 --> 08:43.857
Upon the lowering of my gavel,
the charges shall be dismissed.

08:43.941 --> 08:47.945
I shall raise my gavel
in the air like so,

08:48.028 --> 08:51.447
and then bring it down briskly,

08:51.532 --> 08:54.618
making a satisfying bang,

08:54.701 --> 08:59.373
at which point the prisoner
shall go free.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.010
Angle of approach.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.555
Compensate for warp in floor.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.225
Account for resistance
due to dust motes.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.602
Probable outcome:
termination of mosquito,

09:21.687 --> 09:24.188
integrity of bee habitat maintained,

09:24.273 --> 09:26.608
deadly bee swarm averted.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.656
The mosquito's vanquished.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.949
Well done, Holmes.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.537
It's a simple matter of geometry,
entomology and physics.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.709
Oh, my God!

09:44.793 --> 09:45.793
Oh, shit!

09:46.836 --> 09:48.588
Watson, stop panicking!

09:48.672 --> 09:50.340
We can disable the queen.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.259
It's making them angry, Holmes!

09:58.890 --> 10:00.516
Oh, my God. What are they doing?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.019
They're turning this way!

10:02.269 --> 10:04.812
Just do anything! Help me!

10:06.940 --> 10:07.941
- It's working!
- No!

10:08.024 --> 10:09.485
It's not working!

10:09.567 --> 10:11.694
- Get it off!
- It's not working!

10:13.113 --> 10:14.823
Holmes, we retreat.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.201
Run for safety. I'll lead them away.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.350
Stop this trial!

10:50.234 --> 10:54.071
May I present to you
the greatest detective of all time.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.072
Solver of the unsolvable.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.990
Untier of Gordian knots.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.119
Bester of conundrums.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.163
The great Sherlock Holmes.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.625
Sherlock! Sherlock! Sherlock!

11:10.586 --> 11:12.798
Stop this trial at once!

11:18.553 --> 11:20.847
Thank goodness
you've arrived, Mr. Holmes.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.809
Now, what startling
new evidence do you have

11:23.892 --> 11:25.894
- for the court?
- I am the evidence.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.481
Inspector Lestrade
called upon me for assistance,

11:30.566 --> 11:33.652
for he lacked the mental capacity
to solve it himself.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.904
The inspector is a handsome man.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.490
Ruddy. Strapping.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.869
Legs like oaken trunks.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.370
Teeth like ivory.

11:43.995 --> 11:48.332
And yet his wife is of hideous visage,
terrible to look upon.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.418
They say her gaze curdles milk.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.044
- What?
- Who says that?

11:52.129 --> 11:53.589
Face like a pig's rectum.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.257
- Geoffrey.
- Holmes!

11:55.340 --> 11:56.884
Close those pillowy lips.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.052
I am under oath!

11:59.135 --> 12:01.471
Actually, you're not under oath.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.306
Not under yours.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.100
Under my own sworn duty as a detective.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.645
I cannot allow my brain
to be clouded with feelings.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.773
Now...

12:10.855 --> 12:13.107
I recall the day vividly.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.527
I arrived at the crime scene alone,

12:15.610 --> 12:18.697
completely and utterly alone.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.993
I meticulously inspected
every nook and cranny of that study,

12:24.077 --> 12:25.995
hunting for clues,

12:26.080 --> 12:29.291
much like a panther stalks its prey.

12:34.296 --> 12:39.468
And as I stood there, I began to employ
a groundbreaking new technique.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.719
Right there.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.138
Behold, fingerprints!

12:44.097 --> 12:48.309
Imagine a print
being taken from a finger.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.644
I love it.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.563
How do these prove Moriarty's guilt?

12:56.110 --> 12:57.110
Watson.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.407
Moriarty would never
leave a trail of clues,

13:01.490 --> 13:04.993
which begs the question,
"Why was this crime scene

13:05.076 --> 13:08.913
"so uncharacteristically
littered with fingerprints?"

13:08.996 --> 13:10.206
Good work, Watson.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.833
Thank you. I just thought
of what you might have done.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.836
I compared these prints

13:13.918 --> 13:16.462
to those of the man standing before you.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.548
A perfect match.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.426
Unequivocal proof that this man

13:22.135 --> 13:23.136
is innocent.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.346
What?

13:24.429 --> 13:28.224
But if those are Moriarty's prints,
then Moriarty is the murderer.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.726
This man is not Moriarty.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.604
He sure looks like Moriarty.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.813
He's an impostor.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.525
His name is Jacob Musgrave.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.860
A complete look-alike. A doppelgänger.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.990
A patsy framed to hang
for Moriarty's crimes

13:43.157 --> 13:45.743
so that I may abandon my pursuit of him

13:45.908 --> 13:48.662
and he can begin life anew in America.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.415
Why would an innocent man agree
to hang for Moriarty's crimes?

13:52.582 --> 13:53.666
Elementary.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.085
This man is terminally ill.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.046
Look at him, his pallid complexion,

13:59.005 --> 14:00.882
the palsy in his left hand.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.177
Wait, I know. He's an onanist.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.346
Yes, of the most enthusiastic kind.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.806
What's an onanist?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.600
He... Let's see.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.394
He pours his own tea.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.899
He likes to create his own sauce.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.610
He is a saucier.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.947
And the name of his restaurant
is Crotch Kitchen.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.285
On a daily basis,
he creams his own éclair.

14:28.659 --> 14:32.581
He is Romeo and Juliet.

14:32.873 --> 14:33.874
That should do it.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.501
This here!

14:36.585 --> 14:37.836
He's a wanker!

14:37.919 --> 14:38.920
Thank you.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.214
Sorry, ladies.

14:40.547 --> 14:44.176
This chap here had nothing to lose
by being executed.

14:44.259 --> 14:47.262
He was literally dying by his own hand.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.222
It causes death, you see.

14:49.306 --> 14:52.600
The infallible Sherlock Holmes
has indeed spoken.

14:52.683 --> 14:56.270
In light of his testimony,
I order the release of the suspect.

14:56.355 --> 14:58.565
What? This is an outrage!

14:58.649 --> 15:01.192
Do not let this murderer free.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.778
Bang, bang, bang!

15:03.861 --> 15:05.238
Court is adjourned.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.365
Sherlock Holmes has done it again!

15:11.285 --> 15:12.703
Why are you cheering?

15:13.996 --> 15:14.997
Sherlock!

15:15.081 --> 15:18.626
Sherlock! Sherlock! Sherlock!

15:18.710 --> 15:20.129
That couldn't have gone better.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.422
It couldn't have.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.131
And I tell you, that case was rather...

15:23.215 --> 15:25.759
It took us three years to catch him.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.261
If we release him now,
we may never find him again.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.974
Put aside your ego and admit I am right.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.185
I am afraid
Moriarty's long gone to America.

15:36.144 --> 15:40.732
Whatever crimes Moriarty commits
from now on are on your head.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.528
I quite like seeing Lestrade upset.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.237
Yeah. I do, too.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.747
Professor James Moriarty
fled to the Americas

15:54.830 --> 16:00.919
and would never darken England again.

16:03.922 --> 16:07.301
What a fine ending
to my final book of our adventures.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.178
All there is left to do now
is to let the ink dry

16:10.261 --> 16:12.513
on this one copy of my manuscript.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.230
No.

16:22.316 --> 16:23.317
Fucking son of a...

16:30.073 --> 16:31.282
Holmes.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.284
Are you upset?

16:34.285 --> 16:36.120
It's just that Moriarty
was the whetstone

16:36.205 --> 16:38.290
upon which I sharpened my mental blade.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.835
With him gone,
not there to challenge me, why go on?

16:42.836 --> 16:47.758
Instead, I shall occupy my great,
great mind with nutritional science.

16:48.049 --> 16:52.011
My research suggests that the sulfurous
compounds of the common onion

16:52.096 --> 16:54.597
can increase your red blood cells.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.225
Vital for human health.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.394
Just bite it like an apple?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.567
Definitely takes four or five bites.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.364
Are we meant to eat the whole thing?

17:10.445 --> 17:11.696
The whole thing.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.410
Let the juice slither down
the back of your throat.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.164
Congratulations, Holmes.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.085
You're not only
the smartest man in London,

17:23.166 --> 17:25.127
you shall soon be the healthiest.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.462
Indeed.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.384
Now, where's my opium?

17:32.428 --> 17:33.512
Mrs. Hudson!

17:33.595 --> 17:35.556
- Hudson!
- Hudson!

17:35.638 --> 17:36.639
Help!

17:36.722 --> 17:39.143
Hudson, Watson has stuck
a carrot up my bum!

17:39.226 --> 17:40.477
Hudson, help!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.562
- Fire!
- Call the police!

17:42.645 --> 17:44.272
Hudson, your mother has died!

17:44.355 --> 17:46.150
You brain-dead bag of bones!

17:46.232 --> 17:50.319
- Hudson!
- Hudson!

17:50.403 --> 17:51.739
Hudson, where are you?

17:53.656 --> 17:55.491
Did you not hear any of that?

17:55.576 --> 17:57.536
- We screamed "fire."
- Where?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.245
And we were screaming your name.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.038
You were just there in my bedroom?

18:06.086 --> 18:08.172
Supawn and succotash.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.798
The great Sherlock Holmes.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.968
- I am Mark...
- You curl your R's,

18:13.050 --> 18:16.846
indicating a native from
a less-educated United State.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.598
Namely, Missouri.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.184
Smudge of ink on your waistcoat,

18:21.643 --> 18:24.480
index finger of your right hand
calloused from a quill.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.733
You are the writer
of popular fiction, Mark Twain.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.653
But can you deduce
what we've been up to?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.530
I'll give you a clue.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.784
It rhymes with "Huck Finn."

18:36.866 --> 18:39.452
Hudson. How many times have I told you

18:39.536 --> 18:41.830
about bringing men into
our home for your trolloping?

18:41.913 --> 18:43.664
Were you rooting in my room?

18:45.459 --> 18:46.710
I'm sorry.

18:47.001 --> 18:50.379
I just cannae help myself
when it comes to pleasures of the flesh.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.633
Shame, you dirty girl.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.509
I promise it won't happen again.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.385
The next time I go to confession,

18:56.470 --> 19:01.892
I'll add 12 Hail Marys
for my sins of carnality.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.435
It reeks of exposed loins.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.730
Just take your amorous American
and be gone.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.150
Out. More writing
and less fornicating, Twain.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.527
All right.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.904
- Shut up.
- Come on.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.325
No wonder my room always smells
like fish pie and semen.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.123
This came for you.

19:25.958 --> 19:29.253
Sealed by hands unused to manual labor.

19:32.798 --> 19:35.759
Saliva from a protein-rich diet
of chicken kidneys.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.429
Why, Watson, it's from the Queen.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.307
Seems Her Majesty requests my services.

19:42.391 --> 19:45.144
A crime that has baffled
even her closest advisors,

19:45.227 --> 19:48.063
and only my singular intellect
can solve it.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.605
Well, well, well.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.607
Look who's back in the game.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.027
Watson, are you all right?

19:55.112 --> 19:56.654
I'm just very nervous.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.948
I've not met the Queen before.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.455
- Deep breath.
- Your Majesty,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.499
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.794
Oh, my God, it's really her.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.806
Watson.

20:23.557 --> 20:24.767
Say something.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.435
I love you.

20:27.519 --> 20:32.316
I know I am duty-bound to serve you,
but let me just say on a personal note,

20:32.398 --> 20:34.150
- I really like you.
- Stop touching her.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.276
Just as a fan.

20:35.986 --> 20:38.572
Please, sir. Don't touch the Queen.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.032
Quite right.

20:41.575 --> 20:42.951
Sorry, Your Majesty.

20:43.035 --> 20:44.745
You look a lot smaller in person.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.164
- Just stop.
- Sorry. It's true.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.750
Just stop talking.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.168
- Yes.
- Stop talking.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.586
I'm crazy about your look.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.089
What did I say?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.424
- Am I still talking out loud?
- You are.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.884
- It's just the Queen.
- Yes.

21:00.928 --> 21:02.721
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:02.805 --> 21:06.682
Your Majesty,
how may we be of service to the realm?

21:06.767 --> 21:09.269
Mr. Holmes, pray follow us.

21:09.353 --> 21:11.395
There is danger about.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.942
What a looker, right?

21:15.025 --> 21:16.485
She is stunning in person.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.488
Fear not, Your Majesty,

21:20.571 --> 21:23.574
Sherlock will allow no harm
to come to you, and neither will I.

21:23.659 --> 21:28.705
Five, four, three, two, one.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.249
Surprise!

21:30.749 --> 21:32.375
Thank you.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.420
Had I been a non-genius
such as yourselves,

21:35.503 --> 21:38.673
there's a 72% chance
I would have been surprised.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.675
72%.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.512
Happy birthday, Sherlock Holmes.

21:44.596 --> 21:47.807
We wish you well and thank you
for your many years...

21:48.767 --> 21:51.394
Your many years of public service.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.482
- So, Holmes.
- Yes.

21:56.567 --> 21:57.567
When did you know?

21:57.651 --> 21:58.902
Tuesday.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.237
Really?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.655
You were seven minutes late coming home.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.993
Stopped at the stationer's,
confirmed by the scent of paper mulch.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.537
You have the nose of a bloodhound.

22:08.703 --> 22:11.289
Your mustache betrayed
a dusting of crumbs.

22:11.457 --> 22:13.667
Evidence of cake sampling.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.877
Guilty.

22:15.961 --> 22:19.338
And you purchased a case
of pre-phylloxera champagne.

22:19.423 --> 22:23.218
You lack the self-esteem to buy yourself
such an extravagant bottle.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.178
It's true.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.138
I don't deserve nice things.

22:31.684 --> 22:35.271
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

22:35.355 --> 22:39.108
For he's a jolly good fellow

22:39.192 --> 22:41.360
And so say all of us

22:42.738 --> 22:43.864
Bravo.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.324
Thank you.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.950
That was delightful.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.703
A layer cake!

22:50.788 --> 22:52.205
It's shaped like a magnifying glass.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.331
Yes!

22:57.086 --> 22:59.337
The second layer is rather thick.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.842
There must be a few nuts
in there. If I may.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.010
- Would you mind?
- Here. Yes, of course.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.305
Do you see what I'm talking about?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.431
Yes.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.017
Raspberry jam.

23:13.727 --> 23:14.728
My weakness.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.187
I know what I need.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.898
What the... He's getting an ax!

23:18.981 --> 23:20.442
- Brilliant.
- Charge!

23:23.945 --> 23:26.490
Stand back. Back, everyone, I say.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.034
A murder in Buckingham Palace.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.660
Look, a note. There.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.746
Right under your nose.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.963
"A birthday present for you, Sherlock.

23:42.047 --> 23:44.298
"A crime to challenge your wits.

23:44.383 --> 23:46.802
"Stop me in four days' time,
or I will destroy

23:46.884 --> 23:49.054
"London's greatest marvel
and kill the Queen,

23:49.137 --> 23:51.013
"and I will rewrite history."

23:51.848 --> 23:54.225
Signed "Professor James Moriarty."

23:55.853 --> 23:59.189
This is Jimmy Gruber,
the witness who disappeared,

23:59.355 --> 24:01.775
whose testimony prompted
Moriarty's arrest

24:01.858 --> 24:04.278
and whom Moriarty swore to kill.

24:04.361 --> 24:05.821
And your conclusion?

24:08.615 --> 24:12.452
That Moriarty has killed again,
as I predicted.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.038
The most obvious conclusion.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.417
No, this is definitely the work

24:18.500 --> 24:21.252
of someone who is going
to extraordinary lengths

24:21.336 --> 24:24.173
to make it appear
as if Moriarty committed these crimes.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.383
- Sherlock Holmes.
- The Queen.

24:28.009 --> 24:31.305
We charge you with the task
of stopping this criminal

24:31.387 --> 24:32.847
before he can do us harm.

24:33.557 --> 24:36.852
Solve this case on behalf
of your queen and country.

24:37.019 --> 24:38.311
- I will.
- We will.

24:38.394 --> 24:39.520
But, Your Majesty...

24:39.605 --> 24:42.274
Sherlock Holmes has never failed us.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.442
The bold ingenuity of this crime

24:44.526 --> 24:46.945
calls me back
to the profession of detecting

24:47.028 --> 24:48.571
like a siren song.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.406
I won't let anyone hurt you.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.283
Watson. To the morgue.

24:52.451 --> 24:54.787
Lestrade, clean this mess up now.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.246
- The game is a-starting.
- Yeah.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.546
Who is this copycat
pretending to be Moriarty?

25:04.712 --> 25:07.382
Finally, a problem worthy of my brain.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.134
This birthday cake is delicious.

25:09.218 --> 25:10.635
Did you get a chance to try it?

25:10.803 --> 25:12.387
No, there was a corpse in it.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.057
What the...

25:16.767 --> 25:18.059
Watson?

25:19.353 --> 25:20.813
Oh, my goodness.

25:22.730 --> 25:23.816
Finders keepers.

25:23.898 --> 25:24.899
Yeah.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.028
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather wait out here?

25:28.194 --> 25:29.737
The last time you were
in the morgue, you...

25:29.821 --> 25:33.825
Watson, I am a man
of stout constitution.

25:33.909 --> 25:36.745
Yes, of course.
I just thought, after the last time,

25:36.828 --> 25:38.204
with the...

25:38.997 --> 25:40.332
And the...

25:41.208 --> 25:43.252
Merely a bout of stomach influenza.

25:43.419 --> 25:44.628
Yes, but the time before that?

25:44.795 --> 25:47.047
- Bad clams.
- And before that?

25:47.131 --> 25:48.715
I shook hands with a prostitute.

25:48.798 --> 25:50.134
Yes.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.761
No. Put that away.

25:53.846 --> 25:58.349
I'm not some vaporous,
giggling, fainting maiden who...

26:05.315 --> 26:06.607
Oh, ye of little...

26:10.362 --> 26:11.779
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.657
I think I'm starting to feel a bit...

26:14.741 --> 26:15.783
I wouldn't...

26:15.867 --> 26:18.119
- Are you...
- No, I'm fine.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.705
'Cause if you start to feel sick,
then I'll start to feel...

26:25.794 --> 26:28.172
- Surely I must be done.
- Yes.

26:28.255 --> 26:30.007
Next to impossible to still...

26:37.388 --> 26:38.681
There you are.

26:38.766 --> 26:40.601
- All done.
- Yes, there.

26:41.769 --> 26:43.644
- Would you like some water?
- Did you say water...

26:44.563 --> 26:45.855
Sorry. I'm sorry.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.232
Shall we begin the autopsy?

26:48.901 --> 26:51.028
Thank goodness
these cleaning women are here

26:51.111 --> 26:52.278
to clean up this dreadful mess.

26:52.362 --> 26:53.489
Someone's made sick.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.575
My dear Watson, these women

26:56.657 --> 26:58.367
are far too well-dressed
to be cleaning women.

26:58.535 --> 27:02.498
They're here to identify
their well-to-do husbands' bodies.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.040
Sorry for your loss.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.543
Thank you, but I am the doctor.

27:06.710 --> 27:10.047
Look, Watson,
grief has scrambled her brain.

27:10.130 --> 27:12.007
She thinks she's a doctor.

27:12.090 --> 27:15.301
Fortunately, Miss,
there's a real doctor here

27:15.384 --> 27:16.595
who may help you.

27:16.929 --> 27:18.180
Would you like some heroin?

27:18.638 --> 27:20.723
Dr. Watson, I presume.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.018
And you must be Sherlock Holmes.

27:23.102 --> 27:25.144
Dr. Grace Hart of Boston.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.523
A woman doctor?

27:27.605 --> 27:30.025
- What times we live in.
- Yes.

27:30.442 --> 27:32.903
In America, we're much more progressive.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.781
I now make 30 cents
for every dollar a man earns.

27:35.864 --> 27:38.491
What does "doctor" mean in America?

27:38.575 --> 27:40.326
It means "doctor."

27:40.411 --> 27:42.371
You're Dr. G. Hart?

27:42.453 --> 27:44.163
- Of Boston?
- Yes.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.875
Holmes, we're in the presence
of a pioneer.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.670
Dr. Hart's work with the use
of electroshock therapy

27:49.752 --> 27:52.047
to cure female hysteria
is groundbreaking.

27:52.131 --> 27:56.051
Yes, I proved the higher the voltage,
the more demons are released.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.301
Well, of course.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.387
Some of my patients live
as long as a week.

27:59.471 --> 28:02.057
Doctor? Spelled D-O-C-T-O-R?

28:02.141 --> 28:03.683
Yes.

28:04.143 --> 28:05.978
This is my aide, Millicent.

28:06.561 --> 28:09.689
She's very shy,
but a wonderful traveling companion.

28:10.441 --> 28:13.067
Shall we proceed to the examination?

28:13.736 --> 28:15.738
- Please.
- Our cadaver awaits.

28:17.823 --> 28:19.199
No, no, no.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.616
Here.

28:21.326 --> 28:23.162
Mr. Holmes, you look rather unwell.

28:23.244 --> 28:26.539
Perhaps you would rather stay here
and keep Millicent company.

28:29.710 --> 28:30.961
Sherlock Holmes.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.336
Charmed to meet...

28:34.673 --> 28:35.758
To meet you.

28:36.467 --> 28:38.634
Millicent is the subject of my research.

28:38.719 --> 28:40.804
She was raised by feral cats.

28:40.887 --> 28:43.055
She has the mental capacity
of a four-year-old,

28:43.140 --> 28:46.226
but it is my belief that
with sufficient electroshock therapy,

28:46.309 --> 28:49.145
she can achieve the intellect
of a six-year-old.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.230
We are truly
in the golden age of medicine.

28:51.315 --> 28:52.857
There's nothing left to learn.

28:52.941 --> 28:53.942
No.

28:55.903 --> 28:57.488
What a creature you are.

29:08.373 --> 29:11.460
You're devouring that onion
with such passion.

29:14.546 --> 29:16.048
It's strangely arousing.

29:17.633 --> 29:18.967
Dr. Watson, I have always

29:19.050 --> 29:22.386
been taken by your unwavering
devotion to Mr. Holmes,

29:22.471 --> 29:25.932
but haven't you ever
considered something more?

29:27.101 --> 29:29.561
Perhaps a co-detective?

29:31.771 --> 29:33.439
He and I?

29:33.523 --> 29:34.649
Co-detectives?

29:34.732 --> 29:35.733
Yes.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.653
The very idea!

29:38.820 --> 29:40.446
Solving crimes together?

29:41.656 --> 29:43.908
Laughing and enjoying
the esprit de corps

29:43.991 --> 29:46.662
of two best friends
pursuing a noble cause.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.287
Madness. No, dear.

29:48.372 --> 29:50.833
No, not I.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.460
Not here.

29:54.336 --> 29:58.548
Not even in my most rapturous moments
of private fantasy.

30:04.430 --> 30:07.975
Anyway, let's go clean
this cake-covered bastard, shall we?

30:11.854 --> 30:13.814
The wonders of modern medicine.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.194
Now, you're going to laugh,

30:20.278 --> 30:22.489
but I found the most important
tool of an autopsy is...

30:22.573 --> 30:23.657
Music.

30:25.075 --> 30:26.326
Yes.

30:26.410 --> 30:27.452
You, too?

30:37.336 --> 30:39.298
This one always gets me in the mood.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.177
So begins the dance...

30:52.769 --> 30:54.437
You have some dribble.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.315
Just a touch of dribble right...

31:07.826 --> 31:12.247
There is something so sensual
about forensic autopsy, isn't there?

31:35.729 --> 31:37.189
You are a delight.

31:37.647 --> 31:40.525
Your eyes say more
than words ever could.

31:45.989 --> 31:49.992
The tincture of ammonia and scrotum.

31:50.451 --> 31:52.371
Hello, Inspector Lestrade.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.165
We have combed the manifests

31:56.250 --> 31:59.127
of every ship to set sail
for the Americas

31:59.211 --> 32:02.338
and found not a single Moriarty.

32:02.423 --> 32:05.592
Moriarty's too cunning
to use his own name.

32:05.675 --> 32:07.343
He's sailing under an alias.

32:08.386 --> 32:09.471
Here we are.

32:09.555 --> 32:11.807
So, after a thorough...

32:11.973 --> 32:13.349
Very thorough.

32:15.269 --> 32:17.019
- Stop.
- No, you stop.

32:18.063 --> 32:20.065
...examination of the body...

32:20.148 --> 32:24.694
And I must say, Dr. Hart made some
beautiful lateral incisions there.

32:24.778 --> 32:29.866
No, watching you flay the skin
from his face so gently.

32:29.950 --> 32:32.286
- I would flay a thousand faces for you.
- And the way...

32:32.368 --> 32:33.870
Just tell me what you found!

32:34.371 --> 32:36.081
Yes.

32:36.164 --> 32:37.750
Cause of death indeterminate.

32:37.833 --> 32:39.168
Indeterminate?

32:39.250 --> 32:40.543
What do you mean?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.171
It means he doesn't know.

32:43.046 --> 32:44.465
- Proceed, Watson.
- Yes.

32:44.882 --> 32:48.802
We found a freshly applied
tattoo of a cross

32:48.969 --> 32:51.346
and the numbers one and 20.

32:51.846 --> 32:53.682
I have the oddest feeling.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.350
It's like knowing, but the opposite.

32:56.518 --> 32:57.978
Meaning you haven't a clue.

32:58.060 --> 33:01.522
Who is this genius pretender
who's taken Moriarty's place,

33:01.606 --> 33:04.151
committing crimes
exactly the way he would?

33:05.861 --> 33:07.821
A fantastic new case.

33:07.904 --> 33:10.156
I'm aroused
both mentally and physically.

33:10.240 --> 33:13.951
I was wondering, rather than
working beside you on this case,

33:14.036 --> 33:16.663
I might work with you as a sort of...

33:16.913 --> 33:18.664
Grace called it a "co-detective."

33:19.124 --> 33:23.045
One cannot simply just
make someone a detective.

33:23.127 --> 33:24.462
It must be earned.

33:24.546 --> 33:27.007
Well, I deduced you might say that.

33:27.090 --> 33:31.928
Which is why, when we arrive home,
I propose a game of chess.

33:32.721 --> 33:34.181
If I should best you,

33:34.263 --> 33:36.224
then surely
I possess the mental power...

33:36.307 --> 33:38.769
Checkmate!

33:38.935 --> 33:41.062
What? We haven't started yet.

33:41.355 --> 33:42.980
You would have opened
with the Queen's Gambit.

33:43.523 --> 33:45.233
Indeed. A reliable first move.

33:45.317 --> 33:46.902
I would have countered
with a Slav Defense.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.863
An audacious move. Quite unexpected.

33:49.946 --> 33:52.407
You would have panicked,
thus exposing your queen.

33:52.490 --> 33:53.491
No, not my queen!

33:53.575 --> 33:57.078
Seeing your queen exposed
would have compelled you to defend her.

33:57.162 --> 34:00.124
Indeed. It is my duty in chess,
as in life.

34:00.207 --> 34:02.251
Thereby neglecting my castle.

34:04.461 --> 34:05.671
Checkmate.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.257
Perhaps another game?

34:08.340 --> 34:10.175
Rock-paper-scissors.

34:10.259 --> 34:12.677
Rock, rock, paper, paper,
scissors, paper,

34:12.760 --> 34:14.846
rock, scissors, paper, rock.

34:15.722 --> 34:16.723
Dash it all!

34:16.806 --> 34:18.099
What about Battleship?

34:18.266 --> 34:20.851
D-three, E-three, F-three and G-three.

34:20.936 --> 34:23.105
Damn it, you've sunk my battleship.

34:23.188 --> 34:25.023
You're a good man, Watson,

34:25.733 --> 34:27.192
but you're not ready.

34:28.485 --> 34:29.737
But why?

34:29.820 --> 34:32.114
If you were ready, you'd know why.

34:42.916 --> 34:44.501
Let the game begin.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.585
A piece for a piece.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.880
Two can play at that game.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.447
Peekaboo.

35:17.617 --> 35:18.701
Checkmate.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.663
And to the victor, the spoils.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.793
You'll never be co-detective.

35:32.965 --> 35:35.802
Watson, I'm near a breakthrough.

35:35.969 --> 35:41.809
My hypothesis is the true cause of death
is ink poisoning via the fresh tattoo.

35:41.891 --> 35:43.309
But I need your help.

35:45.896 --> 35:47.523
You want me to be co-detective?

35:49.108 --> 35:51.485
I'm awfully sorry, Dr. Watson.

35:52.110 --> 35:53.319
Sorry for what?

35:53.403 --> 35:55.155
Mr. Holmes left me no choice.

35:55.239 --> 35:57.615
- May you rest in peace.
- What's she on about?

35:57.699 --> 36:01.619
All will be clear in three, two, one.

36:03.996 --> 36:04.998
Excuse me.

36:05.081 --> 36:06.290
I'll take that.

36:06.583 --> 36:08.251
It's just something caught in my throat.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.128
Oh, no.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.463
I poisoned you.

36:11.880 --> 36:12.881
Why?

36:12.965 --> 36:14.508
To test my theory.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.134
Am I going to die?

36:16.217 --> 36:17.510
No, I have an antidote.

36:18.302 --> 36:20.012
But I need to see it play out.

36:20.806 --> 36:22.224
Now, let's see here.

36:22.724 --> 36:24.226
Redness around the mouth. Good.

36:24.476 --> 36:25.477
Help me.

36:25.811 --> 36:28.188
You will have temporary brain damage.

36:30.023 --> 36:31.817
Wake up, Watson. Wake up.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.318
We have work to do. Watson.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.903
Who's Watson? I'll kill him!

36:36.112 --> 36:37.321
You son of a bitch!

36:37.405 --> 36:38.489
Violent aggression.

36:38.574 --> 36:40.492
Please give me the antidote.

36:40.576 --> 36:41.827
Drama queen syndrome.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.163
Why am I doing this?

36:44.246 --> 36:45.456
Confused mime.

36:46.289 --> 36:48.458
Does this suit make me look fat?

36:48.541 --> 36:50.168
Body image dysmorphia.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.045
My eyes!

36:52.128 --> 36:54.297
- Sensitivity to light.
- My eyes! It burns!

36:55.673 --> 36:57.675
Excruciating abdominal pain.

36:58.427 --> 36:59.845
Yes, it's confirmed.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.971
It was poison. Come, Watson.

37:02.054 --> 37:03.306
Let us not be late.

37:05.476 --> 37:06.477
Of course.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.603
Lactation.

37:09.563 --> 37:11.440
- Why?
- Come along, Watson.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.775
I'll explain in the cab.

37:15.985 --> 37:17.153
There we go.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.947
Oh, thank God for this antidote.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.449
I feel as though
I've completely recovered.

37:22.326 --> 37:23.534
Yes, you have.

37:26.413 --> 37:27.498
There.

37:27.664 --> 37:28.749
So, where are we going?

37:28.916 --> 37:30.959
The fact that the victim was poisoned

37:31.043 --> 37:34.880
suggests the killer lacked
physical strength to overpower him.

37:35.047 --> 37:38.050
The tattoos you examined
have an uneven quality.

37:38.382 --> 37:41.969
It leads me to believe that
they were drawn by a one-armed man.

37:42.137 --> 37:44.556
A one-armed man.

37:44.639 --> 37:45.891
Yes.

37:46.057 --> 37:47.893
A weak man who would use poison.

37:47.976 --> 37:52.898
There is only one one-armed
tattoo artist in all of London.

37:53.065 --> 37:55.900
The nefarious Gustav Klinger.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.363
Dorset Street!
And don't spare the horses!

37:59.445 --> 38:00.655
Dorset Street.

38:00.739 --> 38:04.492
Home of drunkards, thieves
and hairy, old whores.

38:04.742 --> 38:07.286
And, if my theory is correct,
the killer.

38:08.414 --> 38:09.832
Hello, gorgeous.

38:10.998 --> 38:14.752
Though all is calm now,
we must be on highest alert.

38:16.672 --> 38:19.925
Shall we ask someone if they've seen
our one-armed Mr. Klinger?

38:20.007 --> 38:23.469
This neighborhood
does not welcome curious outsiders.

38:23.554 --> 38:25.347
Excuse me. Have you the time?

38:25.514 --> 38:27.015
Not for you, outsider.

38:28.976 --> 38:30.602
Merciful God.

38:30.686 --> 38:32.271
We must blend in.

38:32.353 --> 38:36.357
Fortunately, my time tripping the boards
has made me a master of disguise.

38:36.442 --> 38:37.443
Yes.

38:44.157 --> 38:45.199
You.

38:45.284 --> 38:46.660
What have you done with Sherlock?

38:47.034 --> 38:48.077
Why, Watson...

38:49.288 --> 38:50.371
I never left.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.251
- Amazing.
- Yes, I know.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.753
Yes, you've outdone yourself this time.

38:56.836 --> 38:58.005
Now...

38:58.713 --> 38:59.965
No.

39:00.047 --> 39:01.507
- Still me.
- It's you?

39:01.592 --> 39:03.260
It's still Sherlock.

39:03.342 --> 39:05.303
- All right.
- Rest assured.

39:05.387 --> 39:06.638
It's very convincing.

39:06.804 --> 39:08.222
Now for your disguise.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.141
What will it be?

39:12.268 --> 39:15.396
Yes. You, my friend,

39:16.398 --> 39:21.612
shall play a down-on-your-luck
horseshit salesman.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.530
Yes.

39:24.072 --> 39:25.449
Yes.

39:25.782 --> 39:28.493
Come, Watson. We have
a one-armed killer to catch.

39:28.994 --> 39:30.037
Get into character.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.163
- Horseshit for sale!
- There you go.

39:32.246 --> 39:34.040
- Who will buy my horse's shit?
- I'll take some.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.335
No one must know our true purpose.

39:38.295 --> 39:39.378
What you toffs want?

39:39.922 --> 39:43.884
To buy a pint for any man
who can raise two hands.

39:47.221 --> 39:49.389
Every man has both arms.

39:49.681 --> 39:50.849
Klinger isn't here.

39:51.724 --> 39:53.059
Our journey continues.

39:53.893 --> 39:56.187
- Blend in like a common oaf.
- Yes.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.192
Keep drinking. We need to fit in.

40:00.275 --> 40:01.276
Cheers.

40:04.028 --> 40:05.780
More, more!

40:18.085 --> 40:19.461
They have boxing here.

40:19.545 --> 40:21.046
I don't care if he's small!

40:21.130 --> 40:22.923
- Kill!
- Come on, fight!

40:25.467 --> 40:26.844
Shouldn't we be looking for Klinger?

40:26.927 --> 40:28.887
- Who cares about Klinger?
- Exactly!

40:32.932 --> 40:34.143
Release the child!

40:34.226 --> 40:36.061
Let go of that boy! I want him dead!

40:36.144 --> 40:37.728
Sweet river of piss.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.567
You have real force there.

40:42.818 --> 40:44.236
Arc of stream.

40:44.318 --> 40:45.737
Direction of wind.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.655
Compensate for shy penis.

40:47.739 --> 40:49.574
Avoid splash on shoes.

40:50.826 --> 40:52.119
And release fluids.

40:52.202 --> 40:53.370
Oh, my goodness.

40:53.829 --> 40:56.707
Damn it, I forgot to unzip my pants.

40:57.331 --> 40:58.916
You really are a genius.

40:59.001 --> 41:00.085
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

41:01.420 --> 41:03.255
I should like to send a telegram.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.715
Grace. Stop.

41:07.925 --> 41:10.179
Are you awake? Stop.

41:12.681 --> 41:14.766
You're such a pretty doctor lady.

41:16.893 --> 41:18.561
Are you quite sure this is a good idea?

41:18.644 --> 41:20.021
This is wonderful.

41:20.105 --> 41:23.358
The combination of the late hour
and your drunkenness

41:23.442 --> 41:26.862
allows for communication
of exceptional honesty.

41:26.945 --> 41:27.946
Quite right.

41:28.030 --> 41:29.740
I will call it an intoxigram.

41:29.822 --> 41:32.366
And no one shall ever
regret sending one.

41:32.701 --> 41:35.454
Now, lay bare the fruits
of your inebriation.

41:35.536 --> 41:36.871
Ask her what she's wearing.

41:37.289 --> 41:39.166
What are you wearing? Stop.

41:39.708 --> 41:40.751
Bloomers?

41:40.833 --> 41:42.043
A brassiere?

41:42.126 --> 41:44.170
I'd wager you'd look good in anything.

41:44.253 --> 41:45.588
- Wonderful.
- Stop.

41:45.672 --> 41:47.757
Shall I ask what Millie
thinks about you?

41:49.760 --> 41:51.970
I don't care. Sure. Why not?

41:52.054 --> 41:54.222
What does Millie think of Sherlock?

41:54.306 --> 41:57.976
Does Millie ever drip wax over her body?

41:58.059 --> 42:00.311
Hot wax. Stop.

42:00.686 --> 42:02.397
- Okay. That's enough.
- Yeah, I think so.

42:02.481 --> 42:03.774
Describe your loins.

42:03.940 --> 42:07.610
I have hot loins.

42:08.237 --> 42:10.614
Hot loins for sale.

42:11.114 --> 42:13.324
Come and get them while they're hot.

42:13.409 --> 42:15.327
- Hot, steamy loins.
- Stop.

42:15.411 --> 42:18.956
Now show her how she makes you feel.

42:19.831 --> 42:21.458
Just go ahead. Display it.

42:22.708 --> 42:23.793
There.

42:23.876 --> 42:26.422
Don't look away. Look at it.

42:27.005 --> 42:28.215
There we go.

42:28.297 --> 42:29.799
Telegraph a picture of this.

42:30.175 --> 42:33.262
And make sure you get
the banger and the beans.

42:33.344 --> 42:34.679
Focus on the mushroom.

42:34.847 --> 42:37.516
Are you positive I shan't
regret this in the morning?

42:38.434 --> 42:39.685
You absolutely will.

42:39.768 --> 42:41.311
- Silence, you!
- Say it again.

42:41.394 --> 42:42.646
Say it again. I dare you.

42:42.728 --> 42:43.980
Please say it again.

42:44.063 --> 42:45.815
Do you think you would be
the first man I've killed?

42:45.898 --> 42:47.734
I have the penis of a baby doll.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.823
It's just a statement of fact.

42:57.869 --> 43:02.165
Watson, after a night of drinking,
I could eat a whole pie.

43:02.248 --> 43:04.417
No, it's cakes for me, my friend.

43:04.501 --> 43:05.836
Cakes, indeed!

43:05.918 --> 43:09.255
Yes, cakes stacked on cakes.

43:10.340 --> 43:12.092
We should open a restaurant called

43:12.175 --> 43:16.012
the International House of
Cakes Stacked Upon Other Cakes.

43:16.262 --> 43:19.141
Yes, and you can only eat there
after a night of drinking.

43:19.224 --> 43:21.477
Well, speaking of the night,
I fear it's a night wasted.

43:21.559 --> 43:23.228
No sign of Klinger anywhere.

43:24.396 --> 43:25.981
Not so fast, Watson.

43:26.148 --> 43:28.733
Look at those two men and their tattoos.

43:29.108 --> 43:30.402
I don't understand.

43:30.735 --> 43:33.154
We haven't been able
to find the tattoo artist.

43:33.237 --> 43:35.948
Perhaps we should follow the tattoos.

43:40.161 --> 43:41.413
A gymnasium?

43:41.496 --> 43:43.581
You really think Klinger
would be here, Holmes?

43:43.664 --> 43:45.875
Look alive, Watson.
He could be anywhere.

43:46.751 --> 43:49.003
Three, two, one.

43:49.420 --> 43:51.756
Pick it up! That's it.

43:52.173 --> 43:54.342
Out with the bad air, in with the good.

43:54.425 --> 43:55.719
Look at these health nuts.

43:55.802 --> 43:56.886
Big deep breath.

43:57.304 --> 43:59.722
Obsessed with
the purifying effects of smoke.

43:59.806 --> 44:03.184
All right, good lungful
of the cleansing vapors.

44:04.143 --> 44:05.812
I don't think he's here, Holmes.

44:06.521 --> 44:08.315
Hello!

44:08.398 --> 44:10.358
Sherlock Holmes.

44:11.818 --> 44:13.737
You must be Gustav Klinger.

44:13.820 --> 44:16.824
The one-armed tattoo artist
of Dorset Street.

44:16.907 --> 44:18.158
Looks like it.

44:20.619 --> 44:24.081
Gustav Klinger, I accuse you
of poisoning Jimmy Gruber

44:24.164 --> 44:26.417
and baking him into a large cake.

44:26.500 --> 44:30.753
A deliciously large cake
that I baked myself.

44:30.838 --> 44:32.423
Oh, please.

44:32.672 --> 44:34.006
How dare you?

44:34.090 --> 44:36.426
You did not bake that cake.

44:36.510 --> 44:39.096
Not only did I bake it,
I decorated it, too.

44:39.179 --> 44:41.347
- Impossible.
- It's got a frosting attachment.

44:41.431 --> 44:43.766
You're trying to tell me
that a one-armed man

44:43.851 --> 44:46.894
made a professional,
bakery-quality cake fit for the Queen.

44:46.978 --> 44:49.480
- It's just... It...
- Watson, it doesn't matter

44:49.565 --> 44:51.525
- if he baked the cake or not.
- It really bugs... I know.

44:51.608 --> 44:52.985
- It really...
- Best cake I've ever eaten.

44:53.068 --> 44:54.194
I did bake the cake.

44:54.277 --> 44:56.362
All right, fine. You "baked the cake."

44:56.447 --> 44:58.782
I didn't "bake a cake."

44:59.407 --> 45:00.784
I baked a cake.

45:00.867 --> 45:02.244
Then you admit it.

45:02.411 --> 45:04.037
You killed Jimmy Gruber.

45:04.121 --> 45:05.956
And what if I did, Mr. Holmes?

45:06.123 --> 45:09.333
It's not as if you're in a position
to do anything about it.

45:09.418 --> 45:11.336
He's right, Sherlock Holmes.

45:12.503 --> 45:15.382
You've walked straight into our trap.

45:16.007 --> 45:17.717
- Moriarty.
- Quiet, Watson.

45:18.050 --> 45:21.679
In the name of the Queen,
I arrest you both.

45:22.014 --> 45:23.849
Come, Sherlock.

45:24.307 --> 45:26.018
You don't think it'll be that easy.

45:26.184 --> 45:28.561
You won't be leaving here
alive, Mr. Holmes.

45:29.313 --> 45:33.733
Unless, of course, you fight
your way out of the Hexagon.

45:37.153 --> 45:38.405
Where are you pointing?

45:39.614 --> 45:40.615
There.

45:40.699 --> 45:41.992
This way or that way?

45:42.867 --> 45:43.911
There.

45:44.536 --> 45:45.537
The Hexagon.

45:45.621 --> 45:47.831
But I won't fight a one-armed man.

45:47.914 --> 45:49.791
No. I've got this, Sherlock.

45:50.626 --> 45:52.920
It won't be the first time
I've fought a cripple.

45:54.670 --> 45:56.130
You won't be fighting me.

45:56.215 --> 45:57.966
No, no, no.

45:58.257 --> 45:59.675
You're fighting my mate.

46:00.177 --> 46:01.804
Meet Brawn.

46:19.987 --> 46:20.989
Come on.

46:22.949 --> 46:24.451
I call bullshit.

46:28.454 --> 46:30.623
I fear it might be suicide
to fight this man.

46:30.706 --> 46:32.917
I think it's mostly psychological.

46:36.213 --> 46:38.715
I'm psychologically
scared shitless right now.

46:38.882 --> 46:41.300
Fight! Fight! Fight!

46:44.179 --> 46:45.681
Okay. Okay.

46:45.847 --> 46:48.851
But if you want to watch this fight,
you have to pay.

46:48.934 --> 46:50.519
You have to pay to view it.

46:50.601 --> 46:53.813
This is a pay-to-view-it fight.

46:53.896 --> 46:55.690
Yes, I know it seems a bit unfair,

46:55.773 --> 46:59.277
but if you split it among a few friends
and buy some beers, some pizza,

46:59.360 --> 47:01.279
it could be a fun thing
to do with the guys.

47:01.822 --> 47:06.117
It's time!

47:06.452 --> 47:09.538
Let's get ready to scuffle!

47:11.039 --> 47:12.166
Scuffle!

47:13.791 --> 47:15.793
- Nice!
- What is she doing here?

47:15.878 --> 47:17.129
It's 6:00 in the morning.

47:17.545 --> 47:18.838
Holmes, I don't know why...

47:18.922 --> 47:20.632
- Yes.
- ...but that really jacked me up.

47:21.382 --> 47:22.884
I think I might stand a chance.

47:22.967 --> 47:24.761
It reminds me of Istanbul.

47:24.844 --> 47:27.180
Exactly. And what
did I beat in Istanbul?

47:27.264 --> 47:29.349
- Syphilis!
- Syphilis! Exactly.

47:29.432 --> 47:30.893
- Go get him.
- All right.

47:31.393 --> 47:32.394
Come on!

47:32.478 --> 47:33.854
Come on? You come on.

47:33.936 --> 47:35.271
You!

47:35.355 --> 47:36.981
You mountain of flesh.

47:45.740 --> 47:47.826
Your turn, Mr. Holmes!

47:48.202 --> 47:50.621
Yes, I know. Of course I'm next.

47:55.541 --> 47:57.460
Opponent, 350 pounds.

47:58.045 --> 47:59.338
Use pipe.

47:59.505 --> 48:02.132
Create diversion to distract his gaze.

48:03.967 --> 48:05.177
Plan of attack...

48:05.969 --> 48:08.387
Surprise first blow to center of mass,

48:09.389 --> 48:10.932
gracefully dodge counterpunch,

48:11.934 --> 48:13.435
employ visual impairment,

48:15.061 --> 48:16.605
easily duck wild swing,

48:17.563 --> 48:22.402
utilize Tibetan ototoxic method
to disrupt his balance.

48:24.028 --> 48:25.447
Grab facial hair.

48:25.530 --> 48:26.989
Use for leverage.

48:27.074 --> 48:28.826
Okinawan beard flip.

48:31.536 --> 48:33.038
Enemy incapacitated.

48:34.164 --> 48:35.416
Catch pipe.

48:36.208 --> 48:38.751
Revel in crowd's adulation.

48:53.809 --> 48:54.810
Oh, no.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.481
Good show, Watson.

48:59.565 --> 49:00.691
Thank you, Holmes.

49:02.735 --> 49:03.818
Break his pelvis.

49:04.777 --> 49:06.237
Go! Again!

49:07.072 --> 49:08.824
Club him like a baby seal.

49:14.246 --> 49:15.956
- What have I done?
- No, you're fine.

49:16.414 --> 49:18.041
- Yeah...
- Now...

49:18.125 --> 49:21.043
Tell us everything you know
about the plot to kill the Queen.

49:22.336 --> 49:23.422
All right.

49:23.505 --> 49:24.506
I'll tell you everything I know.

49:27.384 --> 49:28.760
I've been stabbed in the back.

49:31.472 --> 49:32.723
Meaning?

49:32.806 --> 49:34.474
Metaphorically speaking, yes.

49:34.557 --> 49:36.351
No, I've literally
been stabbed in the back...

49:39.771 --> 49:41.230
Holmes, he's escaping!

49:50.407 --> 49:52.659
- So, Moriarty is in England.
- Watson.

49:52.742 --> 49:54.702
Does it look like Moriarty...

49:54.952 --> 49:56.663
Now?

49:56.829 --> 49:58.164
Who is this?

49:58.289 --> 49:59.583
Jacob Musgrave.

50:00.083 --> 50:02.168
As I've been saying all along.

50:02.335 --> 50:07.256
A man who looks so much like Moriarty,
a simple beard fooled almost everyone.

50:07.340 --> 50:08.800
All right, I admit it.

50:08.884 --> 50:09.927
I am no Moriarty.

50:10.927 --> 50:14.013
My name is Musgrave, just like he says.

50:15.349 --> 50:16.517
Who put you up to this?

50:16.682 --> 50:19.561
They've been leaving me notes
telling me what to do.

50:20.813 --> 50:21.855
I don't know who it is.

50:21.938 --> 50:24.315
I swear, I'm just a simple wanker.

50:24.400 --> 50:25.858
He's telling the truth, Watson.

50:26.193 --> 50:28.028
This morally deficient creature,

50:28.737 --> 50:31.824
this awful excuse for a man.

50:31.907 --> 50:34.660
- This bag of rubbish.
- Yes, good one, Watson. Yes.

50:34.742 --> 50:36.536
Come on, guys, I'm dying.

50:36.702 --> 50:39.248
These are the wages of wanking, you see?

50:39.331 --> 50:40.833
- Wait.
- What?

50:40.916 --> 50:43.293
- Just a...
- Don't wank on us.

50:45.295 --> 50:46.797
A coal.

50:46.880 --> 50:49.675
Said you were to take it to Newcastle.

50:51.260 --> 50:53.178
- A lump of coal?
- Yeah.

50:53.429 --> 50:54.762
To Newcastle?

50:54.847 --> 50:56.557
Newcastle by the river?

50:56.722 --> 50:59.684
Perhaps this clue will
lead us to the real mastermind.

50:59.768 --> 51:00.811
Time is running out.

51:00.893 --> 51:02.270
We must save the Queen.

51:02.353 --> 51:03.355
Good luck to you.

51:25.418 --> 51:28.004
Bring these coals to Newcastle.

51:28.672 --> 51:30.132
Coals.

51:30.715 --> 51:32.759
Coals. "Sherlock."

51:32.842 --> 51:35.678
"Three days until I rewrite
history and kill the Queen."

51:35.762 --> 51:37.306
Millicent is the subject of my research.

51:37.389 --> 51:38.724
Coals to Newcastle.

51:38.806 --> 51:41.392
Talking to you is as if our brains
are sharing a tandem bicycle.

51:41.476 --> 51:42.685
She has the mental capacity of...

51:42.769 --> 51:46.606
- Now you have but three days...
- Bring these coals to Newcastle.

51:46.898 --> 51:49.692
Who's the co-detective
Sherlock and me

51:51.110 --> 51:52.737
Good morning, Sherlock.

51:52.987 --> 51:53.989
What's happened?

51:54.072 --> 51:56.949
Well, I'm trying to
untangle this baffling clue.

51:58.367 --> 52:00.703
Ever since I met Millie,
my mind is muddled.

52:00.788 --> 52:04.458
Do you suppose she's infected me
with some sort of a disease?

52:04.625 --> 52:05.708
Disease?

52:05.793 --> 52:07.461
My heart races.

52:07.543 --> 52:09.045
My palms sweat.

52:09.128 --> 52:10.630
I have all these feelings.

52:10.713 --> 52:13.467
Holmes, get a hold of yourself.
You're not sick.

52:14.885 --> 52:15.886
You're in love.

52:15.969 --> 52:17.804
Love? Horseradish!

52:17.887 --> 52:19.014
I'm a man of logic.

52:19.097 --> 52:20.516
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

52:20.599 --> 52:25.019
In fact, I, too, have been taken
by this malady called love.

52:25.686 --> 52:28.523
Grace has asked me to call upon her.

52:28.773 --> 52:30.233
Apparently,

52:30.567 --> 52:33.487
I sent her quite
the charming telegram last night.

52:35.072 --> 52:36.323
Watson, you've cracked it.

52:36.572 --> 52:38.157
Have I? Co-detective?

52:38.242 --> 52:39.660
Think, Watson.

52:39.742 --> 52:43.079
Is there a single logical reason
for Grace to want to seek your company?

52:43.496 --> 52:44.705
Romantic interest?

52:45.248 --> 52:46.833
- No.
- My eyes?

52:46.916 --> 52:48.043
It's all a ruse.

52:48.126 --> 52:50.128
Moriarty escapes to America,

52:50.211 --> 52:52.713
and then these two
American women show up?

52:53.090 --> 52:56.844
Sorry, you're saying Grace
is the killer?

52:56.927 --> 52:58.345
Of course she's not the killer.

52:58.429 --> 53:01.014
She's an American.
She would've used a gun.

53:01.097 --> 53:02.391
Yes.

53:02.474 --> 53:05.144
No, Grace is working for the killer.

53:06.519 --> 53:10.315
We shall seduce her,
and that will lead us to the murderer.

53:11.525 --> 53:12.693
Yes.

53:12.775 --> 53:15.903
Well, we best get you cleaned up
and dressed, then, hey?

53:15.987 --> 53:16.989
Thank you, Watson.

53:17.072 --> 53:18.073
- All right.
- Yes.

53:19.490 --> 53:20.826
You're still here.

53:20.909 --> 53:24.371
Hudson, what are you doing
in my room again?

53:24.454 --> 53:27.039
I told you, I will clean it from now on.

53:27.123 --> 53:28.541
You have your own room.

53:28.625 --> 53:29.626
Under the stairs.

53:29.710 --> 53:31.503
Out!

53:31.753 --> 53:32.755
Come along.

53:33.505 --> 53:34.882
You've soiled it enough!

53:38.217 --> 53:39.886
Good God.

53:40.471 --> 53:42.972
Harry Houdini and Albert Einstein.
Really?

53:43.139 --> 53:45.893
What kind of three-backed beast is this?

53:45.976 --> 53:47.352
There's sometimes more.

53:47.436 --> 53:49.896
I pray in there.
That room is a sanctuary.

53:49.980 --> 53:51.731
I know.

53:52.315 --> 53:54.442
If you only knew the things
I've done in that bed.

53:54.525 --> 53:56.235
I would just get rid of it if I was you.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.447
Why are you bringing
all of these men in here?

53:58.530 --> 54:00.115
Stick to your broomstick.

54:01.199 --> 54:02.576
Go on. In we get.

54:02.659 --> 54:05.496
Move it! You got a job to finish.

54:08.916 --> 54:10.417
Who could that be at this early hour?

54:11.293 --> 54:12.294
Enter.

54:18.175 --> 54:19.259
Her Majesty!

54:21.344 --> 54:23.930
Have you come to see me?

54:24.639 --> 54:27.391
Mr. Holmes, I have
but two days left to live

54:27.476 --> 54:29.644
unless you can solve this case.

54:30.394 --> 54:32.688
My Queen, do come in.

54:33.481 --> 54:36.275
I shall speak
with Mr. Holmes in private.

54:38.487 --> 54:39.570
Your Majesty.

54:40.405 --> 54:41.489
You'll be happy to know

54:41.572 --> 54:44.951
that just this morning
we discovered a new clue.

54:45.034 --> 54:46.286
This chunk of coal.

54:46.369 --> 54:48.204
What does it mean?

54:48.288 --> 54:49.873
It's quite a mystery.

54:51.625 --> 54:53.168
Is this going to be a problem?

54:53.251 --> 54:54.503
Watson.

54:54.585 --> 54:56.921
Perhaps the Queen would enjoy some tea.

54:57.005 --> 54:58.507
Yes, of course.

54:59.800 --> 55:03.262
Mr. Holmes,
the empire is depending on you.

55:03.344 --> 55:07.014
Your Majesty, I now suspect
two American women

55:07.099 --> 55:08.976
are somehow involved in this plot.

55:10.184 --> 55:12.813
Sorry. Your Majesty,

55:13.605 --> 55:16.733
do you think I could have
a picture of us together?

55:16.817 --> 55:18.818
But, who is going to
take the photograph?

55:18.902 --> 55:20.820
No, I'll take the photograph.

55:20.903 --> 55:23.449
You see, it's a type
of a self-photograph.

55:23.532 --> 55:25.534
I can take it, and I will be in it also.

55:25.617 --> 55:28.579
You know what, I find,
to take the most attractive photographs,

55:28.661 --> 55:32.415
you need to purse your lips together
like a duck-billed platypus.

55:32.708 --> 55:34.626
Platypus face. Chins up.

55:36.670 --> 55:39.047
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

55:39.130 --> 55:40.840
Maybe over by the window.

55:40.923 --> 55:42.842
- The lighting's much better there.
- Yes, capital idea.

55:44.510 --> 55:47.306
Oh, God. Ma'am?

55:47.389 --> 55:48.599
Your Majesty.

55:48.681 --> 55:50.349
Ma'am?

55:50.434 --> 55:51.685
Oh, dear.

55:53.103 --> 55:54.813
Tell me, Watson.

55:55.813 --> 55:57.273
She's dead.

55:58.608 --> 55:59.942
Dear God.

56:02.362 --> 56:04.364
We've killed the Queen.

56:04.447 --> 56:05.949
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

56:06.492 --> 56:07.659
Yes.

56:07.742 --> 56:09.702
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

56:09.786 --> 56:11.079
Yes, I'm quite fine.

56:11.163 --> 56:14.333
My lover John Watson
will take good care of me.

56:16.293 --> 56:18.378
Why did you want that photograph?

56:18.461 --> 56:20.672
I didn't want the photograph.

56:20.755 --> 56:22.757
What are you talking about?

56:22.840 --> 56:24.717
Mr. Holmes? Dr. Watson?

56:24.802 --> 56:26.678
I'm very safe.

56:26.762 --> 56:29.347
- She's so dead.
- She's so dead.

56:29.431 --> 56:30.724
I know. Okay.

56:30.807 --> 56:32.141
We'll shove her down the toilet

56:32.226 --> 56:34.519
as if she was never here,
and we'll deny ever seeing her.

56:34.603 --> 56:35.938
Right. Excellent.

56:36.021 --> 56:37.439
Come on. Come up.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.275
Here we are. Into the bathroom.

56:43.237 --> 56:44.613
Mr. Holmes! Dr. Watson!

56:44.695 --> 56:45.989
What was the big bang?

56:46.072 --> 56:47.615
We must buy some time.

56:47.699 --> 56:48.700
- Right.
- Let's get her to the door.

56:48.784 --> 56:49.910
- Open this door!
- Wait.

56:50.577 --> 56:52.037
Hello. What do you want?

56:52.121 --> 56:53.664
Ma'am, are you all right?

56:53.746 --> 56:55.873
Yes, of course I'm fine. Can't you see?

56:55.958 --> 56:57.876
- Yes, of course, Ma'am. I'm so sorry.
- We've got it from here, boys.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.043
- Thank you.
- We're good.

56:59.128 --> 57:00.129
Yes, sir.

57:01.255 --> 57:02.297
- The trunk.
- Yes.

57:02.380 --> 57:04.007
Yes, we'll mail her to Africa.

57:05.592 --> 57:06.927
Come on, Ma'am. Sorry.

57:07.010 --> 57:08.095
There we go.

57:08.177 --> 57:09.512
Stuff her in there.

57:09.596 --> 57:11.056
Really thrust.

57:11.139 --> 57:12.391
Good.

57:12.724 --> 57:14.434
Good.

57:14.518 --> 57:15.601
Hold on, Watson.

57:15.686 --> 57:17.604
Come on, boys. Open the door!

57:18.563 --> 57:20.356
Mr. Holmes! Dr. Watson!

57:20.440 --> 57:22.525
One, two, three. Watch your fingers.

57:23.860 --> 57:25.194
Open this door immediately!

57:25.612 --> 57:26.864
This is bad.

57:26.947 --> 57:28.615
You know what we must do.

57:29.782 --> 57:31.034
Grab your toolbox.

57:31.117 --> 57:33.286
Let me in! I'm breaking down the door!

57:35.664 --> 57:37.666
- Bone saw.
- Bone saw.

57:37.750 --> 57:38.958
- Oh, God.
- Come on. Push! Come on, together!

57:39.041 --> 57:40.210
Watson.

57:40.293 --> 57:42.920
- Toilet-sized chunks.
- Put your back into it!

57:46.759 --> 57:48.010
Good God!

57:48.092 --> 57:49.510
What have you done?

57:51.179 --> 57:52.847
Platypus lips.

57:59.813 --> 58:03.483
Can you send me a copy
of the self-photograph?

58:04.693 --> 58:05.694
Absolutely.

58:05.777 --> 58:11.532
It will arrive at the Palace
in about a week.

58:12.617 --> 58:13.826
Gentlemen...

58:13.911 --> 58:17.371
You have two days to stop this killer.

58:17.456 --> 58:18.707
Yes, Ma'am.

58:20.083 --> 58:21.375
God save the Queen.

58:26.215 --> 58:28.092
What a perfect day for a picnic

58:28.175 --> 58:32.346
at London's greatest spectacle,
the Anglo-American Exhibition.

58:32.429 --> 58:34.222
A celebration of
that special relationship

58:34.306 --> 58:35.974
between our nation and yours.

58:36.057 --> 58:40.269
Yes, such a special relationship
between these two nations.

58:40.353 --> 58:41.771
Although, I could

58:41.855 --> 58:45.150
never live in a country
with an unelected ruler like the Queen.

58:46.068 --> 58:47.194
Why ever not?

58:47.568 --> 58:49.612
In America, we have democracy.

58:49.695 --> 58:52.824
Our president is a person
our people have all chosen.

58:53.992 --> 58:57.996
An assurance that only the finest
and most qualified man will lead.

58:58.079 --> 59:01.875
Not a wealthy tyrant
who cares for nothing but himself.

59:01.958 --> 59:03.501
But you have the electoral college,

59:03.585 --> 59:04.920
which surely will prevent

59:05.003 --> 59:07.381
some trumped-up charlatan
from gaining power.

59:07.463 --> 59:09.048
Not always, unfortunately.

59:09.132 --> 59:10.842
It would be great
to have a strong businessman.

59:10.925 --> 59:12.594
But a showman as well.

59:12.677 --> 59:14.221
I love a good show.

59:14.304 --> 59:15.597
America.

59:16.431 --> 59:19.267
We gave you your freedom,
and now look what you've done with it.

59:19.351 --> 59:21.353
London's spectacle...

59:21.436 --> 59:24.480
And the hall of wondrous displays.

59:24.565 --> 59:25.691
The White House...

59:26.775 --> 59:28.568
Live till you're 50.

59:28.860 --> 59:31.654
Baby nerve tonic, now with more ether.

59:32.697 --> 59:35.366
Be calm and focused with cigarettes.

59:36.869 --> 59:39.704
Phone! See the telly-phone.

59:39.788 --> 59:40.831
Can I try that?

59:40.914 --> 59:43.125
Anglo-American Exhibition.

59:44.001 --> 59:45.294
Remember, Watson.

59:45.376 --> 59:48.297
Relax them with small talk,
then begin the seduction.

59:49.255 --> 59:52.259
I must say, she doesn't look like
she could be an accessory to murder.

59:54.177 --> 59:56.596
Well, looks can be deceiving.

59:57.847 --> 01:00:00.016
Remember, we're here to seduce.

01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:04.813
These physical displays of strength
will enchant them.

01:00:09.193 --> 01:00:12.237
- I could use a bit of cocaine.
- Did you bring a vial with you?

01:00:16.157 --> 01:00:17.492
Very good.

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.920
- Are you all right?
- I'm exhausted.

01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:33.467
There is one test I can employ to prove
she truly is who she says she is.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:34.885
Do it, Holmes.

01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:37.261
Employ your last test.
I simply must know.

01:00:40.181 --> 01:00:41.182
Help!

01:00:41.266 --> 01:00:42.934
- John?
- This man has been taken ill.

01:00:43.018 --> 01:00:44.061
What?

01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:48.731
- Let me see.
- If only there were a doctor present.

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:52.860
Clearly, he's had a severe blow
to his occipital bone.

01:00:52.945 --> 01:00:53.946
He's concussed.

01:00:54.028 --> 01:00:56.322
- And I am a doctor.
- A doctor?

01:00:56.407 --> 01:00:59.117
A woman doctor. What times we live in.

01:00:59.701 --> 01:01:01.119
Could it be?

01:01:01.744 --> 01:01:04.205
Is Grace truly a doctor?

01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:06.708
Are her feelings of affection genuine?

01:01:06.791 --> 01:01:08.835
Then she's innocent.

01:01:08.918 --> 01:01:11.629
Watson, get up.
We need to go see my brother.

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:13.590
I love you, Grace.

01:01:16.175 --> 01:01:18.719
The legendary Diogenes Men's Club.

01:01:18.804 --> 01:01:20.764
Home of London's most awkward gentlemen

01:01:21.097 --> 01:01:22.724
and my brother.

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:25.144
Holmes.

01:01:25.226 --> 01:01:26.811
I can't believe you have a brother.

01:01:26.894 --> 01:01:29.063
Yes, but we're nothing alike.

01:01:29.148 --> 01:01:30.606
He's an arrogant man

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:32.483
who never appreciates
the people around him.

01:01:33.277 --> 01:01:34.695
Follow me. Here.

01:01:39.365 --> 01:01:41.034
Well, well, well...

01:01:43.244 --> 01:01:45.748
So, you are finally seeking
your brother's help.

01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:48.625
Say, I'm not surprised.

01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:51.294
And this vague assembly
of limbs and fatty tissue,

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:53.130
I assume is Dr. Watson.

01:02:07.436 --> 01:02:08.896
So, shall I get us started?

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.567
Watson, please.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:15.568
We're in the middle of a conversation.

01:02:15.652 --> 01:02:16.695
Can't you see?

01:02:16.778 --> 01:02:20.574
When the two most brilliant minds
in all of England have a fraternal bond,

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:22.992
words are an inefficiency.

01:02:23.077 --> 01:02:24.411
We communicate without words,

01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:27.705
silently, from giant brain
to gianter brain.

01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:28.791
Of course.

01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:31.793
I'll join in as I see fit.

01:02:35.463 --> 01:02:38.467
I can spare a few minutes
to solve your little mystery

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.885
and help quench your thirst
for public adulation.

01:02:41.512 --> 01:02:43.555
My thirst is for logic.

01:02:43.639 --> 01:02:45.641
I don't care what the public thinks

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:48.936
of London's best-loved detective,
Sherlock Holmes.

01:02:49.018 --> 01:02:50.269
Thoughts.

01:02:51.105 --> 01:02:54.065
Me-me talky.

01:02:54.148 --> 01:02:55.942
You find killer.

01:02:56.025 --> 01:02:58.903
Me-me talky? We find killer?

01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:01.532
Watson, what are you trying to do?

01:03:01.614 --> 01:03:02.990
Trying to brain-speak.

01:03:03.074 --> 01:03:04.451
You're going to hurt yourself.

01:03:05.327 --> 01:03:06.370
Sorry.

01:03:07.079 --> 01:03:09.373
Perhaps the gentleman
would be more comfortable

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:11.959
in the companions' chamber.

01:03:12.458 --> 01:03:15.670
Perhaps, or perhaps I'd be
comfortable here by the fire.

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:18.589
- In the companions' chamber, sir.
- Yes, fine. Of course.

01:03:18.673 --> 01:03:20.550
Great idea. Yeah, capital idea.

01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:22.302
- I'll be in the companions' room.
- Yes.

01:03:22.385 --> 01:03:25.264
The equal companions' room,
should you need me.

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:26.598
It's just here.

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:33.730
Please enjoy
the company of your fellow companions.

01:03:34.063 --> 01:03:35.398
I see.

01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:39.360
Balloons are happy,
but they're not alive.

01:03:40.862 --> 01:03:41.989
Fair enough.

01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:50.956
Who is this brilliant nemesis
capable of besting me?

01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:54.626
If your nemesis
were truly smarter than you,

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.043
it could only be me.

01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:58.797
And as I am not the killer,
one must conclude

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.341
that the killer did not,
nor could not, outwit you.

01:04:02.425 --> 01:04:05.429
If the killer
is my intellectual inferior,

01:04:05.512 --> 01:04:07.472
how has he predicted my every move?

01:04:07.556 --> 01:04:09.099
The killer did not predict your actions.

01:04:09.182 --> 01:04:12.936
Our murderer is a student of yours,
someone in your proximity.

01:04:13.019 --> 01:04:15.313
Someone who could
observe you undetected.

01:04:15.396 --> 01:04:18.107
Someone who knows you
better than anyone.

01:04:18.192 --> 01:04:19.485
His mind radiates wisdom.

01:04:19.568 --> 01:04:21.195
Sherlock Holmes has done it again!

01:04:24.739 --> 01:04:27.658
I'm dying from anticipation.
What did your brother tell you, Holmes?

01:04:27.742 --> 01:04:29.327
I believe I've cracked the case.

01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:32.039
It was in front of me the whole time,
my dear Watson.

01:04:32.121 --> 01:04:33.664
Do share.

01:04:33.748 --> 01:04:35.917
And ruin the suspense?

01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:38.295
I just thought,
since I worked the case with you...

01:04:38.378 --> 01:04:39.546
And we're here.

01:04:42.715 --> 01:04:43.759
Now...

01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:47.596
You're all wondering
why I gathered you here today.

01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:50.516
Prepare yourself to be astonished.

01:04:51.182 --> 01:04:54.603
The killer could only be a man
who knew my actions at every turn.

01:04:55.353 --> 01:04:58.356
Who was present at every murder?

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.776
Who knows me better than anyone?

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.780
It was you
who arranged my birthday party

01:05:04.862 --> 01:05:07.657
and the cake
which contained the first victim,

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.286
initiating the events
leading us to today.

01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:13.996
Dr. Watson is the killer.

01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:22.089
By studying my methods, you created
a fake crime only you could solve.

01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:27.344
Why? I was to be so impressed
that I would crown him co-detective.

01:05:27.427 --> 01:05:32.391
He wanted to rewrite history
by becoming my partner.

01:05:35.893 --> 01:05:38.771
Okay. Now the part about
how I could never have done it

01:05:38.856 --> 01:05:41.150
and on to the surprising real killer.

01:05:41.233 --> 01:05:42.776
I wonder who it's going to be.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.028
When one eliminates the impossible,

01:05:45.112 --> 01:05:49.115
whatever remains, however improbable,
is the truth.

01:05:50.409 --> 01:05:52.369
But this is absurd.

01:05:53.119 --> 01:05:56.539
- Holmes, you must know in your heart...
- The heart is for pumping blood.

01:05:56.623 --> 01:05:59.293
The truth is the truth!

01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:01.003
Truth...

01:06:01.628 --> 01:06:04.631
Is that I have devoted my life to you.

01:06:05.382 --> 01:06:06.717
And I was a fool to think

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.844
you would ever consider me
as a co-detective

01:06:08.927 --> 01:06:12.306
when you're incapable of thinking of me
even as a friend!

01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:17.311
Inspector Lestrade, take him. Go on.

01:06:17.393 --> 01:06:19.228
But the man is your closest friend.

01:06:19.313 --> 01:06:21.231
Your pursuit of Moriarty has failed.

01:06:21.315 --> 01:06:23.150
You have no suspects.

01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:25.736
The killer still threatens
to kill the Queen.

01:06:25.818 --> 01:06:28.112
Is that a chance you're willing to take?

01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:30.449
- Take him.
- What?

01:06:33.744 --> 01:06:35.954
Do you see his propensity for violence?

01:06:36.038 --> 01:06:37.789
- Do you still doubt me?
- Calm down.

01:06:38.706 --> 01:06:44.128
I shall never again carry
your blasted magnifying glasses.

01:06:44.213 --> 01:06:45.923
Or your jars of urine.

01:06:46.757 --> 01:06:48.592
Why are we even saving these?

01:06:49.259 --> 01:06:52.471
And you look stupid in that hat.

01:06:53.137 --> 01:06:56.266
Your head was not meant for hats.

01:06:58.351 --> 01:07:00.186
Unhand me! No!

01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:02.188
I'll never forget you, John.

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:05.858
Why?

01:07:05.943 --> 01:07:10.114
John Watson devoted his life to you,
and this is how you repay him?

01:07:10.197 --> 01:07:13.992
Back to America
with your ham-dogs and hot-burgers.

01:07:14.076 --> 01:07:16.202
At least in America, our system's fair.

01:07:16.869 --> 01:07:20.289
No citizen can be found guilty
till his case is heard

01:07:20.373 --> 01:07:23.084
by a jury of white property-owning men.

01:07:24.378 --> 01:07:26.963
Millie, surely you must understand.

01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:37.891
Fine, go.

01:07:37.974 --> 01:07:40.726
I'm the greatest detective
who ever lived.

01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:43.146
You're welcome for solving this case.

01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.565
Sherlock abandons Watson!

01:08:02.081 --> 01:08:04.710
Sherlock, a washed-up loser!

01:08:39.453 --> 01:08:40.787
A tear?

01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:43.957
What is this tear?

01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:49.252
I can't stop it.

01:08:54.841 --> 01:08:57.970
What is this warm feeling in my chest?

01:09:03.894 --> 01:09:07.231
Why am I reeling in confusion?

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:11.317
What is this fever in my head?

01:09:12.152 --> 01:09:17.908
Is it pox, maybe gout
I can't seem to work it out

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:23.287
And why don't I feel triumphant?

01:09:24.206 --> 01:09:29.962
And why does it seem less than right
that Watson's going to hang tonight

01:09:30.045 --> 01:09:34.800
And gasp and thrash and choke
until he's dead?

01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:38.595
What is this strange sensation?

01:09:38.679 --> 01:09:41.221
Where did I go wrong?

01:09:41.305 --> 01:09:44.308
Why am I a sobbing, trembling man?

01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:46.435
Soon my neck will snap in half I guess

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.732
And yet I know somehow

01:09:49.898 --> 01:09:53.359
- If he could hear right now
- And yet right now

01:09:53.444 --> 01:09:55.487
- I would still forgive him
- I would still forgive him

01:09:58.532 --> 01:10:01.577
More or less

01:10:01.993 --> 01:10:04.704
Please, I don't know upon
whom else to call

01:10:04.787 --> 01:10:07.582
Nothing is making any sense at all

01:10:07.666 --> 01:10:09.752
Speak! I need your voice

01:10:09.835 --> 01:10:13.713
To hear your voice, so sweet
So pure, so wise

01:10:18.761 --> 01:10:25.684
Sometimes the irrational
is truer than the rational

01:10:25.768 --> 01:10:29.061
The heart can have its reasons

01:10:29.145 --> 01:10:33.192
Which the head knows nothing of

01:10:33.274 --> 01:10:36.444
Your brain says "Watson's guilty"

01:10:36.569 --> 01:10:40.407
But a stronger force says,
"No, he's not!"

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:42.576
What is that force?

01:10:42.658 --> 01:10:44.368
- It's...
- Yes? What?

01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:47.790
- It's love!
- Love?

01:10:47.872 --> 01:10:51.751
- It's love!
- It's love!

01:10:51.835 --> 01:10:53.712
- It's love!
- It's love!

01:10:53.837 --> 01:10:56.090
- It's love!
- It's love!

01:10:56.547 --> 01:10:58.257
My God.

01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:02.887
Did I push Watson away
because I feared losing him to Grace?

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.098
Somehow I know in my heart...

01:11:06.557 --> 01:11:08.393
Watson is innocent!

01:11:08.476 --> 01:11:12.730
- Come save me now
- Time to go and save

01:11:12.814 --> 01:11:18.361
- The man I love
- The man I love

01:11:21.489 --> 01:11:22.698
Watson!

01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:26.870
I discovered my emotions,
and I'm only 46.

01:11:26.953 --> 01:11:28.788
Hang!

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.461
Oh, God.

01:11:34.545 --> 01:11:36.838
Hang Dr. Watson!

01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:39.048
The dogs seem really unnecessary.

01:11:39.675 --> 01:11:41.135
Sherlock.

01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:44.680
It's you.

01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:46.722
And you've brought cake.

01:11:54.605 --> 01:11:55.815
Watson!

01:11:55.899 --> 01:11:57.025
My brother!

01:11:57.109 --> 01:11:58.694
Watson, where are you?

01:11:58.777 --> 01:12:00.112
Where...

01:12:00.194 --> 01:12:01.863
I'm too late.

01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:07.911
Clever.

01:12:07.994 --> 01:12:11.998
Very, very clever.

01:12:17.712 --> 01:12:22.509
You were always so clever,
and I never appreciated it.

01:12:23.342 --> 01:12:25.554
But it's not too late to make amends.

01:12:25.636 --> 01:12:26.889
Watson!

01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:29.224
I shouldn't have wasted
all my time singing!

01:12:34.438 --> 01:12:36.230
Grimy news kids.

01:12:36.314 --> 01:12:38.232
I desperately need your help.

01:12:38.317 --> 01:12:40.027
Dr. Watson's in grave danger.

01:12:40.109 --> 01:12:41.737
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

01:12:41.819 --> 01:12:43.154
Because of you, you wank!

01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:44.323
I know.

01:12:44.405 --> 01:12:46.033
But I know of a way to save him.

01:12:46.115 --> 01:12:48.368
Please. Please help me.

01:12:48.452 --> 01:12:51.246
I must find a way
to the docks immediately.

01:12:54.582 --> 01:12:58.461
"Moriarty's daughter did
the one thing Moriarty never could:

01:12:58.545 --> 01:13:03.216
"She defeated Sherlock Holmes
and assassinated the Queen.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.927
"Sherlock Holmes,
the man whom I regarded

01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:12.935
"as the best and the wisest man
whom I would ever know, was a fraud."

01:13:16.771 --> 01:13:18.189
It is done.

01:13:18.981 --> 01:13:21.819
A devilish plan worthy of your father.

01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:26.698
The last book in
the Sherlock Holmes canon is complete.

01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:29.451
"The Case of the Defeated Detective."

01:13:29.534 --> 01:13:32.703
Daddy will be so proud.

01:13:32.787 --> 01:13:34.288
Sherlock will be remembered

01:13:34.372 --> 01:13:37.083
as the man who failed
to protect the Queen.

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:39.211
History shall be rewritten

01:13:39.293 --> 01:13:43.172
at the hand
of his loyal Boswell, Dr. Watson.

01:13:43.798 --> 01:13:45.591
I've done your bidding.

01:13:45.676 --> 01:13:46.718
Now set me free.

01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:49.887
You're gonna die here.

01:13:50.346 --> 01:13:51.681
You gave me your word.

01:13:51.765 --> 01:13:53.307
You swore on the life of the Queen.

01:13:53.391 --> 01:13:56.894
I'm gonna kill the Queen,
you big eejit. Boys!

01:13:56.979 --> 01:13:59.021
Mrs. Hudson is the killer?

01:13:59.105 --> 01:14:00.314
Gorblimey!

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:01.900
How'd you work that out?

01:14:01.984 --> 01:14:03.944
Why, it was Watson who told me.

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:06.363
You see, beet sugar.

01:14:06.697 --> 01:14:09.490
Mrs. Hudson's family recipe
and Watson's favorite.

01:14:09.574 --> 01:14:12.786
He never would have left crumbs behind
unless he was leaving me a clue.

01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:16.038
For, you see, Mrs. Hudson's origins
are not so humble.

01:14:16.122 --> 01:14:20.042
She is none other than the daughter
of Professor James Moriarty.

01:14:20.127 --> 01:14:21.420
No, it ain't possible.

01:14:21.502 --> 01:14:24.465
You see, Mrs. Hudson
never knew her father.

01:14:25.131 --> 01:14:26.299
He was never present.

01:14:26.382 --> 01:14:29.886
To gain his love, she tried to
pull off the greatest crime ever.

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:33.390
Destroy the great Sherlock Holmes.

01:14:33.474 --> 01:14:36.476
She took a job at my house
in order to study my methods,

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.772
then used a network of patsies
to execute her plans.

01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:42.774
However, it wasn't until
I understood feelings

01:14:42.858 --> 01:14:47.237
that I understood her motive,
her need for her father's love.

01:14:47.613 --> 01:14:50.324
She would gain it
by eliminating his greatest enemy.

01:14:50.407 --> 01:14:51.742
Me.

01:14:52.201 --> 01:14:56.663
And tonight, she will commit
her boldest crime yet,

01:14:56.747 --> 01:15:00.292
killing the Queen here!

01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:04.003
The Titanic. The marvel of London.

01:15:04.087 --> 01:15:08.050
A new castle, which runs on coal.

01:15:08.132 --> 01:15:10.551
Your Majesty, may I introduce
Lieutenant Morgan.

01:15:10.927 --> 01:15:11.929
Lieutenant.

01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:13.971
First Officer Carter.

01:15:14.847 --> 01:15:16.891
- Your Majesty.
- First Officer.

01:15:17.434 --> 01:15:19.144
Look, Hudson's goons.

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:20.854
Create a diversion.

01:15:20.938 --> 01:15:23.023
You go and save Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes.

01:15:23.106 --> 01:15:24.524
We'll take care of this lot.

01:15:24.608 --> 01:15:26.150
Come on, you tom tit!

01:15:26.234 --> 01:15:28.778
You ain't bigger than
a couple of powder monkeys.

01:15:29.822 --> 01:15:31.573
Is there a problem, boys?

01:15:31.698 --> 01:15:33.992
Think we can take them, lads?

01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:36.244
Walk away now,
and I promise you won't get hurt.

01:15:36.328 --> 01:15:38.997
A bunch of runts and a couple of ladies?

01:15:39.081 --> 01:15:40.457
American ladies.

01:15:45.295 --> 01:15:46.755
Not my eyes!

01:15:51.342 --> 01:15:53.886
I'm sorry to do this, Dr. Watson.

01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:56.597
I'm gonna crush your head.

01:15:56.681 --> 01:15:59.809
There's gonna be brains everywhere.

01:15:59.893 --> 01:16:02.104
And I'll not be cleaning up after.

01:16:02.186 --> 01:16:03.521
I know you're threatening me,

01:16:03.604 --> 01:16:05.273
but I can't understand
a word you're saying.

01:16:06.233 --> 01:16:08.569
You're staying, Dr. Watson,

01:16:08.652 --> 01:16:12.448
but I'll be on my way to America
by the time the bomb explodes.

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:13.990
Sherlock will save me.

01:16:14.073 --> 01:16:15.992
- You'll see.
- I'll see.

01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:17.911
He won't let me down.

01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:19.787
He won't. He's my best friend.

01:16:21.497 --> 01:16:22.832
Dollface!

01:16:27.421 --> 01:16:30.548
Come on, boys.
The bomb goes off in ten minutes.

01:16:30.631 --> 01:16:33.844
Sherlock! Sherlock!

01:16:34.802 --> 01:16:36.889
Help!

01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:38.849
Sherlock!

01:16:39.515 --> 01:16:40.725
Help!

01:16:42.019 --> 01:16:43.270
Watson!

01:16:45.605 --> 01:16:49.568
Oh, God, if you save me,
I'll never touch myself again.

01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:52.028
- Watson!
- Sherlock.

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:53.614
You've come for me. I knew you would.

01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:55.949
Watson, good news.

01:16:56.033 --> 01:16:57.493
You're innocent.

01:16:58.243 --> 01:16:59.995
Yes. I know.

01:17:00.578 --> 01:17:02.081
Thank you.

01:17:02.247 --> 01:17:03.332
Can you forgive me?

01:17:03.414 --> 01:17:06.710
Of course. Now, be a good chap
and get me out of this damn thing

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:08.252
before it crushes my skull.

01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:10.047
Yes? There's a good chap. Go on.

01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:12.673
I won't leave you. Not again.

01:17:12.757 --> 01:17:14.134
That's a lovely sentiment,

01:17:14.217 --> 01:17:16.845
but I really need you
to free me from this gear right now.

01:17:17.345 --> 01:17:19.430
Emotions are spewing from my heart.

01:17:19.806 --> 01:17:21.265
- Pull yourself together.
- Okay.

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:22.392
Stop crying.

01:17:22.475 --> 01:17:24.978
Because we must get the Queen
and everyone else off this ship.

01:17:25.061 --> 01:17:26.939
You see, Hudson has planted a bomb.

01:17:27.064 --> 01:17:28.856
A time bomb, you see?

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.692
- You must free me.
- Do you feel my heart ticking?

01:17:30.775 --> 01:17:32.653
Get me off this fucking wheel!

01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:35.697
All my dreams are coming true.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.868
In just two minutes, my bomb
will go off, killing the Queen.

01:17:40.327 --> 01:17:42.413
Sherlock Holmes will go down in history

01:17:42.496 --> 01:17:45.873
as the worst detective
the world has ever known.

01:17:45.957 --> 01:17:49.377
And the name Moriarty
will live on forever!

01:17:51.462 --> 01:17:52.965
Father...

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.926
Soon, we shall be together again.

01:17:56.009 --> 01:17:59.096
- In America!
- Yeah!

01:18:05.769 --> 01:18:08.480
The bomb will detonate in one minute.

01:18:08.564 --> 01:18:10.691
Where could it possibly be?

01:18:11.734 --> 01:18:13.318
Wait.

01:18:13.402 --> 01:18:15.069
That kettle drum.

01:18:15.154 --> 01:18:18.115
Those are only ever used
in mounted cavalry formations,

01:18:18.198 --> 01:18:19.658
never in a Marine band.

01:18:19.742 --> 01:18:21.118
Perhaps...

01:18:21.534 --> 01:18:24.037
The bomb is in the drum.
Very good, Watson.

01:18:24.121 --> 01:18:25.873
But the Queen is standing
just beside it.

01:18:25.956 --> 01:18:27.248
She'll be blown to smithereens.

01:18:27.332 --> 01:18:28.917
But how to defuse it in time?

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:34.214
Time remaining until
bomb detonation: 55 seconds.

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.885
Estimated blast radius
from bomb: 17 feet.

01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:41.054
Time required to move Queen
to safety: 12 seconds.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:43.181
Solution: Move through crowd,

01:18:43.265 --> 01:18:46.268
see Millie for the first time,
forget about bomb.

01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:47.728
No.

01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:53.067
Time remaining: 37 seconds.

01:18:53.442 --> 01:18:55.610
Solution: Shoot water main
to douse bomb,

01:18:55.694 --> 01:18:57.988
remember Millie at the park,
forget about bomb.

01:18:58.072 --> 01:18:59.239
No, I forgot about the bomb!

01:19:03.659 --> 01:19:05.953
Watson, what are you doing in my brain?

01:19:06.037 --> 01:19:07.497
I'm doing it.

01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.125
I'm communicating without words.

01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:12.836
I can't focus.
I was trying to formulate a plan,

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.671
and I kept getting off track.

01:19:14.755 --> 01:19:17.466
Holmes, no, you don't. Snap out of it.

01:19:17.548 --> 01:19:19.342
I can't. I'm too emotional.

01:19:19.426 --> 01:19:21.845
Look behind me.
The Queen's being blown to bits.

01:19:21.929 --> 01:19:23.430
You have to take control.

01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:25.599
You must be detective for both of us.

01:19:25.681 --> 01:19:26.934
Right.

01:19:28.644 --> 01:19:30.020
I know what I must do.

01:19:30.104 --> 01:19:33.690
Estimated blast radius: 20...
No, 30 feet?

01:19:33.774 --> 01:19:36.693
Account for ship's movement.
Wait, is that a four or a seven?

01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:38.654
Math is so hard. Hold on.

01:19:38.737 --> 01:19:40.864
What does that "X" mean?
Or is that a plus?

01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:43.867
What is that thing? Angle of approach?
I don't know how to do angles.

01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:45.284
Should've listened more in school.

01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:46.661
Screw it. Charge!

01:19:48.831 --> 01:19:50.039
Out of my way!

01:19:50.498 --> 01:19:51.625
Move!

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:54.545
Nine. Eight.

01:19:54.627 --> 01:19:56.087
Coming through!

01:19:56.171 --> 01:19:57.713
- So sorry!
- Seven.

01:19:58.923 --> 01:20:00.050
Come on.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.385
Move your tuchis!

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:03.220
Sorry!

01:20:05.096 --> 01:20:07.306
Five. Four.

01:20:10.685 --> 01:20:12.103
Two.

01:20:16.734 --> 01:20:17.735
Shit.

01:20:23.823 --> 01:20:25.158
Huzzah.

01:20:25.451 --> 01:20:27.286
Huzzah for Sherlock Holmes.

01:20:27.368 --> 01:20:29.579
Sherlock Holmes saved the Titanic.

01:20:30.163 --> 01:20:32.166
- Huzzah!
- Hurrah for Sherlock!

01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:33.708
Bravo, Sherlock!

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:36.170
Sherlock Holmes
was right about everything!

01:20:36.252 --> 01:20:37.420
Hip hip hooray!

01:20:38.713 --> 01:20:40.256
Thank you.

01:20:41.382 --> 01:20:44.051
But I could never have done it
without Dr. Watson.

01:20:44.136 --> 01:20:45.304
No.

01:20:45.386 --> 01:20:50.183
Let Watson's name
be forever associated with the Titanic.

01:20:50.266 --> 01:20:52.519
So, when you think
of your friends and relatives

01:20:52.603 --> 01:20:56.440
on board the Titanic, just remember,

01:20:56.523 --> 01:21:01.110
Dr. John H. Watson put them there.

01:21:01.194 --> 01:21:02.820
Hooray for Watson!

01:21:03.113 --> 01:21:04.948
Bloody good they didn't hang him.

01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:10.120
Dr. Watson, you saved us.

01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:11.789
Thank you.

01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:14.583
It has been my pleasure
to serve you, Your Majesty.

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:32.810
No, Millie.

01:21:43.404 --> 01:21:44.947
I have a confession to make.

01:21:45.488 --> 01:21:47.532
I'm not actually in love with you.

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:50.284
In order to conclude my investigation,

01:21:50.368 --> 01:21:53.579
it was imperative
that I understood what love felt like.

01:21:53.663 --> 01:21:55.289
I'm sorry to have led you on.

01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:58.210
I have a confession as well.

01:21:58.292 --> 01:21:59.836
I was also not in love.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.255
I was conducting an experiment

01:22:01.337 --> 01:22:03.506
on how easy it is
to manipulate the male ego.

01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:06.885
- What?
- I'm sorry I led you on.

01:22:07.594 --> 01:22:09.721
Well, I have another confession.

01:22:10.471 --> 01:22:12.515
I was just pretending to have a big ego,

01:22:12.765 --> 01:22:15.018
so as to make you think that
your experiment was working

01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:17.145
so that I could conclude
my experiment on you.

01:22:17.354 --> 01:22:19.106
Well, I had to lead you on,

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:22.443
because I was doing an experiment
about how men think they can manipulate

01:22:22.525 --> 01:22:23.818
female scientists
while they're doing experiments.

01:22:23.902 --> 01:22:25.194
Well, I have another confession to make.

01:22:37.666 --> 01:22:41.003
You will be shocked to learn
that was my first kiss.

01:22:41.377 --> 01:22:43.671
Mine as well,
and we've already mastered it.

01:22:43.756 --> 01:22:45.257
Yes, indeed.

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:49.677
All aboard! She sails in 20 minutes!

01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:51.220
Hurry, everyone! Step lively!

01:22:51.305 --> 01:22:53.682
Enjoy your trip
on the safest ship to sail.

01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:56.809
- Goodbye.
- Farewell, Grace.

01:22:57.351 --> 01:22:58.353
Goodbye, Millie.

01:22:58.436 --> 01:23:00.814
Make sure you get plenty of bed rest.

01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:02.608
There's a good chance you're pregnant.

01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:03.983
I hope so.

01:23:04.068 --> 01:23:05.903
From the kissing?

01:23:07.029 --> 01:23:08.864
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:12.451
- What a grand ship.
- Yes.

01:23:13.952 --> 01:23:15.244
Watson, look.

01:23:16.079 --> 01:23:17.247
It's Billy Zane.

01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:19.541
Sherlock.

01:23:21.877 --> 01:23:23.837
He's breathtaking.

01:23:24.253 --> 01:23:26.422
Where's the bar on this canoe?

01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:32.261
Holmes.

01:23:32.345 --> 01:23:34.639
I believe I may have solved
the one mystery

01:23:34.722 --> 01:23:36.809
which has baffled you all these years.

01:23:38.101 --> 01:23:39.269
What?

01:23:42.898 --> 01:23:44.315
Would you mind?

01:23:47.528 --> 01:23:48.820
Do you like it?

01:23:48.904 --> 01:23:50.155
Let's see here.

01:23:51.364 --> 01:23:54.659
- It suits you.
- I think it's perfect.

01:23:54.743 --> 01:23:56.703
Really? You're not just saying that?

01:23:56.787 --> 01:23:59.539
No, I'm not just saying it.

- Good.
- Thank you, Watson.

01:24:01.667 --> 01:24:03.502
And I have something for you as well.

01:24:03.585 --> 01:24:05.128
- No.
- Please.

01:24:05.212 --> 01:24:06.588
- Step over here.
- Why?

01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:09.257
I don't deserve anything.

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:11.135
My dear Watson.

01:24:12.261 --> 01:24:13.387
What do you think?

01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:16.013
It's beautiful.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:45.711
Telegram for Professor Moriarty.

01:24:48.005 --> 01:24:49.256
Professor?

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.140
Boy, who sent this?
