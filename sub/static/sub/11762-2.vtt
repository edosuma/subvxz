WEBVTT

00:00.531 --> 00:10.181
в™Єв™Є

00:10.181 --> 00:12.183
(whispers) ALL CLEAR.

00:14.085 --> 00:17.088
THANK YOU FOR COMING OVER
AND FOR PARKING A BLOCK AWAY

00:17.088 --> 00:20.151
AND FOR LEAVING
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING.
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?
YOU'RE WORTH IT.

00:20.151 --> 00:23.154
I JUST REALLY WANT MY BUSINESS
TO STAY MY BUSINESS, YOU KNOW?

00:23.154 --> 00:25.156
I'M NOT SOME CRAZY PSYCHO CHICK
WHO CAN--
(dog barking)

00:25.156 --> 00:26.657
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

00:26.657 --> 00:30.101
HUG THE SHADOWS!
HUG THE SHADOWS!

00:30.101 --> 00:32.363
MONSTER!
AAH!

00:32.363 --> 00:34.505
(laughs)
I AM SO GETTING YOU BACK.

00:34.505 --> 00:37.308
DON'T. I HATE BEING SCARED.

00:37.308 --> 00:39.110
OH.

00:39.110 --> 00:40.771
WHY ARE YOU EVEN UP?

00:40.771 --> 00:42.773
BECAUSE MY STUPID BABY
WOKE ME UP.

00:42.773 --> 00:46.577
BETTER QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU
WEARING FULL MAKEUP?

00:46.577 --> 00:49.120
I'M NOT READY FOR JOSH
TO SEE MY MORNING FACE.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.122
SO I SET 2 ALARMS--
ONE AT 4:00 AND ONE AT 5:00.

00:51.122 --> 00:53.684
I GET UP AND DO MY HAIR
AND MAKEUP.

00:53.684 --> 00:56.687
I GO BACK TO BED, FAKE ASLEEP
UNTIL THE NEXT ALARM GOES OFF,

00:56.687 --> 01:00.361
AND THEN HE THINKS I WAKE UP
LOOKING LIKE THIS.
CRAFTY.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.733
I THINK SO.
IS THE SEX WORTH IT?

01:02.733 --> 01:04.735
I'LL HAVE TO LET YOU KNOW.

01:04.735 --> 01:07.438
I DECIDED AFTER THAT LAST GUY
TO REINSTATE MY 10-DATE RULE.
OH.

01:07.438 --> 01:09.440
BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE
LET JOSH SLEEP OVER.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.442
THE WHOLE NIGHT
I SPENT PLAYING DEFENSE.

01:11.442 --> 01:13.274
(makes whooshing noises)

01:13.274 --> 01:15.276
NICE.
(front door closes)

01:15.276 --> 01:17.678
BUENOS DГ­AS, CHIQUITAS.

01:17.678 --> 01:21.812
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DO YOU
NOT GET HOW DIVORCE WORKS?
I GOTTA GIVE A GOLF LESSON
AT 6:30,

01:21.812 --> 01:25.286
SO I'M JUST GONNA STEAL
A CUP OF COFFEE.
WELL, THEN OKAY.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.288
(Travis yawns)
OH, MORNING, HONEY.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.490
I NEED TO STUDY
FOR MY ADVANCED CALCULUS TEST.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.863
HEY, BUDDY, YOU WANT SOME HELP?
(Ellie and Jules laugh)

01:32.863 --> 01:35.166
(laughs)
(front door opens and closes)

01:35.166 --> 01:37.468
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHO AM I KIDDING?

01:37.468 --> 01:40.471
CAN YOU TAKE STAN
SO I CAN GET READY FOR WORK?

01:40.471 --> 01:42.473
I'D BRING HIM IN THE SHOWER
WITH ME,

01:42.473 --> 01:45.476
BUT HE ALWAYS PEES ON MY FEET.
HEY, BOBBY!
HEY!

01:45.476 --> 01:47.478
MUCH LOVE. MUCH LOVE. MM!
MM!

01:47.478 --> 01:49.880
THAT'S A LONG HUG THERE,
BIG GUY.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.442
(snores)
TRAVIS!

01:51.442 --> 01:54.285
I'M UP!
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE GOLF CART OUTSIDE?

01:54.285 --> 01:56.247
MM, MY CAR DIED,
SO I KIND OF BORROWED THAT

01:56.247 --> 01:58.819
FROM THE GOLF COURSE
AS, YOU KNOW, A SUBSTITUTE RIDE.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.822
IT'S A HYBRID.
GENIUS, JUST 'CAUSE
IT HAS A PLUG,

02:01.822 --> 02:04.555
DOESN'T MAKE IT A HYBRID.
IT HAULS ASS.
YOU WANT A RIDE TO WORK?

02:04.555 --> 02:06.197
UH, DEFINITELY.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.559
OH, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.
TRAVIS!

02:08.559 --> 02:10.161
(snores) THANK YOU.

02:10.161 --> 02:12.233
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I AM UP AT 5:00 A.M.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.235
'CAUSE THIS IDIOT
DROPPED HIS BINKY.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.408
BEFORE I HAD MY BABY, THE ONLY
TIME I WAS EVER AWAKE THIS EARLY

02:17.408 --> 02:20.671
WAS IN MY 20s, AND I WAS STILL
UP FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE.

02:20.671 --> 02:23.774
I REMEMBER THIS CRAZY NIGHT
THAT STARTED OUT IN NEW YORK

02:23.774 --> 02:25.776
AND ENDED UP IN MIAMI...

02:25.776 --> 02:27.778
THERE I AM.
I'M 23 YEARS OLD.

02:27.778 --> 02:30.781
I'M EATING A 5-POUND BELGIAN
WAFFLE AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING,

02:30.781 --> 02:34.555
AND I REALIZE THE CROATIAN CHICK
HAS GOT A GUN.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.857
...UNTIL IT ENDED,
'CAUSE UP UNTIL THAT POINT,

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
I HAD PARTIED...
(inhales sharply)

02:38.859 --> 02:40.861
AND I AM TALKING
LEGITIMATELY PARTIED--

02:40.861 --> 02:44.335
FOR 45 NIGHTS IN A ROW, BABY!
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

02:47.938 --> 02:49.370
WHAT?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.871
IT'S YOUR TURN.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.903
BEST WAR STORY FROM YOUR 20s.

02:52.903 --> 02:55.606
UM, OKAY, UH,
ONCE WHEN I WAS 22,

02:55.606 --> 02:58.909
I HAD A BABY,
AND I STAYED HOME BY MYSELF,

02:58.909 --> 03:01.252
RAISING HIM,
FOR THE REST OF MY 20s.

03:01.252 --> 03:03.254
(chuckles) THE END.

03:03.254 --> 03:04.855
BOO!

03:04.855 --> 03:07.758
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
THIS GAME ANYMORE, OKAY?

03:07.758 --> 03:11.362
LET'S GO. OUT OF THE KITCHEN.
COME ON.
CAN I JUST GRAB
A CUP OF COFFEE?

03:11.362 --> 03:13.364
NO. I CAN'T DEAL.
HE DRINKS EVERY SIP

03:13.364 --> 03:15.366
LIKE IT'S THE MOST DELICIOUS
THING ON THE PLANET.

03:15.366 --> 03:18.369
DO YOU KNOW HOW ANNOYING
THAT IS?
OH, SWEETIE,
I WANT TO PRETEND TO CARE,

03:18.369 --> 03:22.873
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN GET THERE.
I FEEL YA.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.735
YI YI YI YI YI YI!

03:24.735 --> 03:27.938
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU?!

03:27.938 --> 03:30.241
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD MOM.

03:30.241 --> 03:32.813
(dog barking in distance)

03:32.813 --> 03:34.585
GOOD MORNING, GRAYSON.

03:34.585 --> 03:35.986
HEY.

03:35.986 --> 03:39.320
I'VE BEEN UP FOR HOURS.
I HAD EGGS FOR BREAKFAST.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.952
WHAT?
OH, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT WE WERE SHARING

03:41.952 --> 03:45.756
INCREDIBLY BORING FACTS
ABOUT OURSELVES.
WHEN YOU ACT LIKE
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME,

03:45.756 --> 03:48.729
IT JUST MAKES ME
WANT TO TALK TO YOU EVEN MORE.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.961
THAT MAY BE THE WORLD'S MOST
ANNOYING PERSONALITY TRAIT.

03:50.961 --> 03:53.904
RIGHT? DO YOU EVER GET
THAT OVERWHELMING FEELING

03:53.904 --> 03:58.409
THAT YOU JUST MISSED OUT
ON EVERYTHING?
I DON'T HAVE
OVERWHELMING FEELINGS.

03:58.409 --> 04:00.841
WOULD YOU COME ON? WE--WE ARE
BOTH RECENTLY DIVORCED,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.013
AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH
THIS STUFF.

04:03.013 --> 04:05.015
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS SHOULD BE OUR THING.

04:05.015 --> 04:08.819
WE TALK WHEN WE GET OUR PAPERS.
WE CAN BE PAPER BUDDIES.

04:08.819 --> 04:10.781
NO, THANK YOU.

04:10.781 --> 04:12.853
NOW I JUST WANT IT
EVEN MORE!

04:12.853 --> 04:14.955
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.858
(Andy) WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-
HOO-HOO! (laughs)

04:17.858 --> 04:20.831
AHH! DON'T TELL ELLIE.

04:20.831 --> 04:22.393
LATER, J-BIRD.

04:23.934 --> 04:26.997
OHH! HOLY CRAP,
THAT'S GOOD COFFEE.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.740
(laughs) I KNOW. RIGHT?

04:35.946 --> 04:37.848
WAIT. WHAT EXACTLY WAS
UPSETTING YOU?

04:37.848 --> 04:39.850
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS JUST SO BUMMED

04:39.850 --> 04:42.853
THAT I DON'T HAVE ONE
GOOD STORY TO TELL, YOU KNOW?

04:42.853 --> 04:44.985
HOLD THIS FOR A SECOND.

04:47.958 --> 04:50.461
YES!

04:50.461 --> 04:54.294
I SPENT SO MUCH TIME
ON MY HAIR THIS MORNING,

04:54.294 --> 04:56.997
THAT FELT LIKE
CHEATING DEATH.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.029
(laughs)

04:59.029 --> 05:02.973
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN HAVING REGRETS, JULES,

05:02.973 --> 05:06.407
BECAUSE IN THIS GREAT, BIG,
CRAZY THING WE CALL LIFE--

05:06.407 --> 05:09.410
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
RAMPING UP FOR A LONG ONE,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.412
SO FIRST I HAVE TO ASK--
DO YOU THINK

05:11.412 --> 05:15.045
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE OUTFIT
FOR WORK?
I DID UNTIL A SECOND AGO.

05:15.045 --> 05:17.548
FAIR ENOUGH.
OH, WHOA, WHOA.

05:17.548 --> 05:19.550
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WEAR
TRASHY THONGS.

05:19.550 --> 05:23.494
I'VE GOT SOME EMERGENCY
WORK UNDERWEAR IN MY DRAWER.

05:26.797 --> 05:29.029
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS

05:29.029 --> 05:31.532
THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY GOOD STORIES,

05:31.532 --> 05:34.004
YOU CAN JUST START
MAKING SOME NOW.

05:34.004 --> 05:36.106
ARE YOU CHANGING YOUR UNDERWEAR
AT MY DESK?

05:36.106 --> 05:37.968
WHO CARES?

05:37.968 --> 05:40.971
I FEEL LIKE I DO.
JULES, YOU CAN STILL HAVE
YOUR 20s.

05:40.971 --> 05:42.973
I MEAN, YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE.

05:42.973 --> 05:45.916
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE CUTE
BOYFRIEND, WHO, FOR SOME REASON,

05:45.916 --> 05:48.649
YOU'RE STILL NOT SLEEPING WITH.
10-DATE RULE.
(makes whooshing noises)

05:48.649 --> 05:51.051
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS.
BUT THE POINT IS,

05:51.051 --> 05:53.984
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
ADD IN THE FUN STUFF--

05:53.984 --> 05:56.787
YOU KNOW, BARHOPPING,
ROAD TRIPS...

05:56.787 --> 05:59.760
(gasps) EATING PANCAKES
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.892
CRAP, I LOVE PANCAKES.

06:01.892 --> 06:04.064
COME ON AN ADVENTURE WITH ME
TONIGHT.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.966
THE WORD "ADVENTURE"
MAKES IT SOUND REALLY FUN.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.839
THAT'S WHY I PICKED IT.
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.701
YEAH! OW!
OW!

06:10.701 --> 06:13.043
OH, WAIT. I'M SEEING A MOVIE
WITH ELLIE TONIGHT.

06:13.043 --> 06:14.945
SO BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO RELIVE YOUR YOUTH,

06:14.945 --> 06:17.107
INSTEAD OF GETTING A BARREL
OF POPCORN AND EATING IT

06:17.107 --> 06:19.109
WHILE WE STARE
AT VIGGO SOMETHINGSON'S ASS,

06:19.109 --> 06:21.111
I'VE GOTTA GO GET DRINKS

06:21.111 --> 06:24.855
WITH YOU AND YOUR STUPID,
SLAGGY, TOWNIE FRIEND?
ELLIE'S SO EXCITED TO COME.

06:24.855 --> 06:27.618
TELL HER TO BITE ME.
LAURIE'S PSYCHED, TOO.

06:27.618 --> 06:30.961
OH, AND, ELLIE, UM, WE ARE EVEN
FOR THIS MORNING.

06:30.961 --> 06:33.093
WHAT?
MONSTER!

06:34.625 --> 06:37.097
I JUST MADE A HORRIBLE MISTAKE,
DIDN'T I?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.999
YEAH.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.433
ALL RIGHT, LIPSTICK,
EYELINER, TISSUE,

06:42.433 --> 06:45.005
GRANOLA BARS, ASPIRIN.
WHAT ELSE?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.477
STAMPS.

06:46.477 --> 06:48.739
STAMPS. RIGHT.

06:48.739 --> 06:51.111
WAIT.
WHY ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?

06:51.111 --> 06:53.984
BECAUSE IT'S FUN.
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,
YOU NEED MORE STUFF.

06:53.984 --> 06:57.488
THAT'S WHY I-I BROUGHT OUT
OLD BESSIE HERE.

06:57.488 --> 07:00.150
IT'S A PURSE.
IT DOESN'T HAVE A NAME.
BESSIE DOES.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.422
HAVE FUN, FOR ONCE.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.725
THANKS.
YOU HAVE FUN AT DAD'S.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.959
WELL, THIS SHOULDN'T BE
EMBARRASSING AT ALL.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.104
HELPS WITH THE BUGS.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.436
GOOD GOD.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.438
SO ELLIE TOOK A SHOWER
WITH HER BABY,

07:18.438 --> 07:20.711
AND, OF COURSE,
HE PEED ALL OVER HER FEET.

07:20.711 --> 07:22.713
BUT HERE'S THE KICKER.
ELLIE SAID AFTERWARDS

07:22.713 --> 07:24.715
HER SKIN
WAS SO SOFT AND SMOOTH,

07:24.715 --> 07:27.718
SO OF COURSE I'VE GOTTA
FIND MYSELF SOME BABY PEE.

07:27.718 --> 07:30.721
BUT IT'S NO BIGGIE, 'CAUSE
ELLIE'S JUST GONNA HOOK ME UP.

07:30.721 --> 07:33.724
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN'T UNHEAR
THE THINGS YOU SAY.
COME BACK, PAPER BUDDY.

07:33.724 --> 07:38.489
ALL RIGHT, I'LL JUST SEE YOU
AT YOUR MAILBOX IN THE MORNING.
NOT EVER.

07:38.489 --> 07:43.063
в™Єв™Є

07:43.063 --> 07:44.695
ELLIE. I'M BACK.

07:44.695 --> 07:46.036
YOU HAVE TO RE-ENGAGE.

07:46.036 --> 07:47.838
OH.
ON THE PLUS SIDE,

07:47.838 --> 07:50.671
I WAS ABLE TO PUT PEANUTS IN
HER WINE WITHOUT HER NOTICING.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.472
HMM. SO WITTY.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.975
MM. I SHOULD PROBABLY SLOW DOWN.
I'M GETTING A LITTLE BUZZY.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.748
(laughs) THESE ARE
JUST THE DRINKS THAT WE GET

07:57.748 --> 07:59.810
BEFORE WE GO OUT
AND GET DRINKS.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.982
OH, GOOD. SHE'S HERE.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.015
I'VE GOT A BAD CASE
OF THE GOTTA GOs.
NO, NO. DON'T LEAVE.

08:05.015 --> 08:09.119
WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME
WITH ME?
NO, I'M HAVING FUN.
I JUST WANT YOU TO STAY.

08:09.119 --> 08:11.121
BUT THIS ISN'T
HOW I DO FUN ANYMORE.

08:11.121 --> 08:13.123
I'VE GOT MUCH BETTER WINE
AT HOME,

08:13.123 --> 08:17.568
AND I REALLY NEED TO TAKE
MY BRA OFF. ENJOY YOUR 20s.

08:17.568 --> 08:21.031
(laughs) SO I INVITED MY FRIEND
NEZZIE TO ROLL WITH US.

08:21.031 --> 08:23.834
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
I LOVE ROLLING WITH PEOPLE.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.777
YO, THIS IS REALLY COOL.
IT'S LIKE DRINKING WITH MY MOM.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.909
BUT DON'T WORRY.
SHE LOOKS GREAT.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.082
HOW OLD IS SHE?
62.

08:32.082 --> 08:34.114
I WILL KILL HER.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.087
(singsong voice)
HERE'S THE SHOTS.

08:37.087 --> 08:39.519
OH, I DIDN'T ORDER ONE.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.152
CHEERS.
(clink)

08:42.152 --> 08:43.654
AAH!
AAH!

08:43.654 --> 08:46.096
I'LL GET MORE.
OOH.

08:46.096 --> 08:48.158
DID YOU SEE HOW TINY
HER PURSE IS?

08:48.158 --> 08:50.160
YOU CAN'T EVEN PUT
A CREDIT CARD IN THERE.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.003
SHE PROBABLY HAS TO FOLD
HER MONEY INTO TINY SQUARES.

08:53.003 --> 08:54.705
OH, I WAS RIGHT.

08:54.705 --> 08:57.537
JULES, QUIT STALLING.
TOSS IT BACK.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.039
JUST ONE, THOUGH.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.142
OH, WAIT, WAIT. I WANT TO GET
A PICTURE WITH MY PHONE.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.914
READY?

09:03.914 --> 09:05.916
(BeyoncГ©)
в™Є ALL THE SINGLE LADIES в™Є

09:05.916 --> 09:07.948
в™Є ALL THE SINGLE LADIES в™Є

09:07.948 --> 09:10.050
в™Є ALL THE SINGLE LADIES в™Є
в™Є ALL THE SINGLE LADIES в™Є

09:10.050 --> 09:13.053
в™Є ALL THE SINGLE LADIES в™Є
в™Є ALL THE SINGLE LADIES в™Є

09:13.053 --> 09:15.125
в™Є ALL THE SINGLE LADIES,
NOW PUT YOUR HANDS UP в™Є

09:15.125 --> 09:18.128
в™Є UP IN THE CLUB,
WE JUST BROKE UP в™Є

09:18.128 --> 09:19.990

09:33.203 --> 09:35.175

09:37.247 --> 09:39.950

09:42.352 --> 09:44.054

09:50.220 --> 09:52.592
JULES!

09:52.592 --> 09:55.666
OH. OH. HELLO, GANG.

09:55.666 --> 09:57.828
I DID NOT THINK
YOU WERE COMING BACK

09:57.828 --> 10:01.031
TO SEE THE GUEST ROOM AGAIN.
WE'RE JUST GONNA GO LOOK AROUND
A LITTLE MORE.

10:01.031 --> 10:03.373
YOU GUYS TAKE YOUR TIME.

10:03.373 --> 10:06.276
PARTY ROOKIE.

10:06.276 --> 10:08.739
HOW DID SHE KNOW?

10:08.739 --> 10:12.112
(snorts) THAT IS UPSETTING.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.114
(laughs)
SOMEONE ACTUALLY DARED YOU

10:14.114 --> 10:17.387
TO MAKE OUT WITH BARB'S NECK
FOR A SECOND.

10:17.387 --> 10:20.090
I DIDN'T, DID I?
NO.

10:20.090 --> 10:23.023
LET ME SEE THAT.
NO, NO.
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.757
LET ME SEE IT. LAURIE!
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
OH, THERE, IT'S GONE.

10:26.757 --> 10:28.759
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
(chuckles)
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

10:28.759 --> 10:32.162
WE PAR-TAYED LAST NIGHT,
AND I FEEL FINE.
YOU'RE PROBABLY
STILL A LITTLE DRUNK,

10:32.162 --> 10:34.064
AND YOU DON'T REALIZE IT.
OH, WHAT, I'M GONNA GO HOME

10:34.064 --> 10:37.137
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST HAVE
SOME NASTY HANGOVER?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.110
OH, GOD.

10:40.110 --> 10:41.371
WHY?

10:41.371 --> 10:45.115
UH, SORRY TO INTRUDE,
BUT I WANTED TO RETURN THIS.

10:45.115 --> 10:48.779
(grunts, straining)
OH, MY... OHH.

10:48.779 --> 10:50.080
HELP ME.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.953
NAH. GOTTA GO.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.786
AH. BESSIE.

10:55.786 --> 11:00.891
ARE YOU OKAY?
MY HEAD HURTS, I KISSED BARB,
AND GRAYSON MADE FUN OF BESSIE.

11:00.891 --> 11:04.194
OH.
DOES ANDY STILL EAVESDROP
EVERY TIME YOU'RE ON THE PHONE?

11:04.194 --> 11:06.236
I ASSUME SO. ANDY?

11:06.236 --> 11:08.138
RIGHT HERE.

11:08.138 --> 11:10.140
OKAY, TELL ANDY
TO GO OVER TO GRAYSON'S

11:10.140 --> 11:13.143
AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM
AND THEN BE MEAN TO HIM.

11:13.143 --> 11:16.306
WE NEED YOU TO GO OVER
TO GRAYSON'S, MAKE FRIENDS

11:16.306 --> 11:19.109
AND THEN BE MEAN TO HIM.
FINE.

11:19.109 --> 11:21.111
He's in. Go take a nap.
OH, THANK YOU.

11:21.111 --> 11:23.153
(doorbell rings, beep)
WHAT?

11:23.153 --> 11:25.886
YOU SAID I SHOULD STOP BY
ONCE YOUR SON LEFT.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.358
IS THAT WHAT I SAID?
UH-HUH.

11:28.358 --> 11:30.360
OKAY, YEAH.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.225
WHOA! ANDY, WHAT'S UP?

11:35.225 --> 11:37.768
I BROUGHT OVER PIZZA AND BEER.
WHY?

11:37.768 --> 11:41.031
YOU KNOW...
I'M--I'M NOT SURE.

11:41.031 --> 11:46.006
OKAY, WELL, I HAVE TO GO
OPEN UP MY RESTAURANT, SO...
I CAN'T GO HOME YET.
THEY'LL JUST MAKE ME COME BACK.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.478
LOCK THE DOOR
WHEN YOU LEAVE.

11:53.844 --> 11:57.417
AH. WHAT A LOVELY TURN
OF EVENTS.

12:02.152 --> 12:04.855
OH, MOTHER, THAT'S GOOD BEER.

12:09.099 --> 12:10.831
(hisses)

12:10.831 --> 12:12.202
(sighs)

12:12.202 --> 12:14.765
YOU ALWAYS HAVE
TO MAKE THE SOUND?

12:14.765 --> 12:17.007
I DO.
IT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN.

12:17.007 --> 12:19.339
SO FUN.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.042
OH, I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.044
BUT WE ONLY HAVE
FOUR DATES LEFT,

12:24.044 --> 12:26.977
AND WHEN WE GET THERE,
IT IS GONNA BE AMAZING.

12:26.977 --> 12:30.120
MAYBE WE COULD EVEN, UH...
NAH, NEVER MIND.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.183
WHAT?
JUST THIS CRAZY POSITION
I READ ABOUT,

12:33.183 --> 12:36.126
BUT YOU'RE WAY
TOO CLASSY FOR IT.

12:36.126 --> 12:40.130
AND BESIDES, IT'S MORE
OF A YOUNG CHICK THING.
TELL ME MORE.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.192
WELL, YOU JUST TAKE
ONE OF YOUR LEGS

12:42.192 --> 12:44.464
AND JUST PUT IT
OVER MY ARM.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.496
LIKE THIS?

12:46.496 --> 12:48.098
OH!
(crack)

12:48.098 --> 12:51.001
(moaning)

12:51.001 --> 12:53.003
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

12:53.003 --> 12:54.845
OH, YEAH! I'M GREAT.

12:54.845 --> 12:58.008
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND LET
YOURSELF OUT? THERE YOU GO.

12:58.008 --> 12:59.850
YEAH.
(door opens)

12:59.850 --> 13:01.551
BYE, JOSH.
(door closes)

13:01.551 --> 13:06.156
OKAY, SO YOU HURT YOURSELF
BY NOT HAVING SEX?

13:06.156 --> 13:07.988
THAT'S RIGHT. (sniffles)

13:07.988 --> 13:09.990
I'M GONNA GET SOME TAKE-OUT,

13:09.990 --> 13:12.492
AND DO YOU REMEMBER
MY AUNT CAROL?
THE ONE WHO HATES MY HAIR?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.895
YES. I'M GONNA GO
GET MY WEDDING VIDEO,

13:14.895 --> 13:18.198
AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH HER BREAK
HER HIP OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.201
OOH, I LOVE IT
WHEN SHE SCREAMS AND CRIES.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.433
(telephone rings)

13:23.433 --> 13:26.336
(ring, beep)
OH. HEY, LAURIE.

13:26.336 --> 13:29.409
NEZZIE'S GETTING US
A FREE LIMO TONIGHT.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.412
(chuckles) I DON'T THINK
I CAN GO OUT TONIGHT.

13:32.412 --> 13:36.146
IT'S DONE, GIRL.
BUT SATURDAY NIGHT'S
THE BEST NIGHT FOR GOING OUT.

13:36.146 --> 13:38.188
(gasps) SHE SAYS
SATURDAY'S THE BEST NIGHT.

13:38.188 --> 13:40.190
NO! YOU'RE STAYING IN.

13:40.190 --> 13:43.153
COME ON. WE'LL SOAK OUR HANDS
AND FEET IN BABY PEE.

13:43.153 --> 13:45.125
THIS IS YOUR 20s WEEKEND.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.899
WOULD YOU LOOK?
YOU'RE AN INVALID.

13:48.899 --> 13:51.201
SLAGGY HO.

13:51.201 --> 13:54.004
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK
WHEN THEY SEE YOU

13:54.004 --> 13:57.207
OUT WITH THOSE KIDS?
DON'T SAY IT
IF IT'S TOO MEAN.

13:57.207 --> 14:00.170
I MEAN, YOU'RE TOO OLD
FOR THIS CRAP.

14:00.170 --> 14:03.443
YOU LOOK PATHETIC.
GIVE ME THE PHONE. GIVE IT
TO ME. GIVE ME! GIVE ME!

14:03.443 --> 14:07.217
(Laurie) Jules, are you
in a fight? What's happening?
LAURIE, I'M IN. COME GET ME.

14:07.217 --> 14:09.419
ELLIE, GO HOME.

14:21.631 --> 14:23.633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:23.633 --> 14:27.567
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I CAME OUT TO GET THE MAIL,
AND I GOT THIRSTY.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.469
I'M A LITTLE HUNGOVER.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.502
HEY, BUT THANKS FOR CHECKING
ON ME, PAPER BUDDY.

14:32.502 --> 14:35.345
NO, NOT YOUR PAPER BUDDY,
JUST AN ANNOYED NEIGHBOR.

14:35.345 --> 14:37.547
DON'T SEND TINY BALD MEN
TO MY HOUSE.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.549
IS ELLIE WATCHING US
RIGHT NOW?

14:39.549 --> 14:44.114
WE GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT.
YOU SEE, I FEEL LIKE YOU
DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY.

14:44.114 --> 14:46.987
YOU JUST MOVE ON--
TURN AROUND
AND CATCH HER ON THREE.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.658
ONE, TWO--

14:48.658 --> 14:51.161
JUST DO ME A FAVOR
AND STOP TRYING TO DRAG ME

14:51.161 --> 14:53.893
INTO YOUR LITTLE
"WHERE DID ALL THE YEARS GO?"

14:53.893 --> 14:56.997
LITTLE NERVOUS BREAKDOWN THING
YOU SEEM TO BE GOING THROUGH,

14:56.997 --> 14:59.099
OKAY?
THREE!

14:59.099 --> 15:01.171
HA! HA! OH, I GOT YOU!

15:01.171 --> 15:04.504
I WASN'T LOOKING AT YOU,
YOU STUPID HEAD!

15:07.037 --> 15:09.439
DOES ANYBODY ON THIS BLOCK
LIKE YOU?

15:09.439 --> 15:12.312
OOH!
CATCH YOU LATER, P.B.!

15:12.312 --> 15:16.016
HEY! THAT STANDS FOR...
(singsong voice) "PAPER BUDDY"!

15:16.016 --> 15:19.049
(cell phone alert chimes)
I JUST GOT A TEXT.
WHO'S IT FROM?

15:19.049 --> 15:22.322
SOMEONE NAMED
BITCH-SLAP HARRIS.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.055
HUH. GOOD GUY.
HE'S A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.

15:25.055 --> 15:27.027
OF COURSE HE IS.

15:27.027 --> 15:31.261
APPARENTLY, HE SAW A BOUNCER
BEING MEAN TO MOM LAST NIGHT.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.933
WHAT? WHY WOULD ANYONE
WANT TO BE MEAN TO MOM?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.406
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
DAD, DAD, I KNOW THOSE GIRLS.

15:36.406 --> 15:39.239
TURN AROUND.
NO DETOURS. WE'RE RUNNING
LOW ON JUICE, BUDDY.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.371
FINE.

15:41.371 --> 15:43.713
AH, HA HA! AAH!

15:43.713 --> 15:47.417
SARAH, TINA...
DON'T KNOW YOU...

15:47.417 --> 15:49.319
WHAT'S THE HAPS?

15:52.152 --> 15:56.156
(giggling)

16:00.060 --> 16:02.332
JUST DRIVE.

16:04.334 --> 16:06.336
(moaning)

16:06.336 --> 16:10.070
(telephone rings)

16:10.070 --> 16:12.072
(ring)

16:12.072 --> 16:14.204
(ring)

16:14.204 --> 16:15.445
ANDY?

16:15.445 --> 16:17.607
HEY, JULES. YOU--YOU OKAY?

16:17.607 --> 16:19.609
SO ELLIE HAD YOU CALL.

16:19.609 --> 16:23.183
(chuckles) OH, PLEASE,
GIRLFRIEND. I'M MY OWN MAN.

16:23.183 --> 16:27.017
I'M ASSUMING SHE'S SO CLOSE,
YOU CAN'T SPEAK FREELY.
(chuckles) YES.

16:27.017 --> 16:29.759
I KNOW SHE WROTE YOU
A SCRIPT,

16:29.759 --> 16:33.263
SO SAY SOMETHING WRONG
SO I CAN CATCH HER.
UH, "WHEN--WHEN DID
THIS WHOLE 20s THING

16:33.263 --> 16:35.295
START BEING ABOUT
PROOBING SOMETHING?"

16:35.295 --> 16:37.497
PROVING SOMETHING! PROVING!

16:37.497 --> 16:39.229
HANG UP THE PHONE.

16:39.229 --> 16:41.271
GO.

16:41.271 --> 16:45.075
ELLIE, I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

16:45.075 --> 16:48.508
I-I DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS THING
BECAME ABOUT PROVING SOMETHING.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.510
IT JUST DID.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.683
I HATE THE FEELING THAT
I MISSED OUT ON EVERYTHING.

16:53.683 --> 16:56.686
YOU--YOU HAVE YOUR STORIES.
I'VE HEARD ALL OF THEM--

16:56.686 --> 16:59.049
THE NIGHT YOU WERE
IN NEW YORK, MIAMI,

16:59.049 --> 17:01.121
THE--THE MONTH
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE SUN,

17:01.121 --> 17:04.294
THE TIME YOU KISSED A GIRL.
(falsetto singsong voice)
AWESOME!

17:04.294 --> 17:07.026
I KNOW THAT I'M BEING CRAZY.

17:07.026 --> 17:11.161
BUT WHEN I'M BEING LIKE THAT,
IT IS YOUR JOB TO SUPPORT ME!

17:11.161 --> 17:13.663
I MEAN, REMEMBER WHEN YOU
DIDN'T SMILE AT YOUR BABY

17:13.663 --> 17:16.266
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD
GIVE YOU MOUTH WRINKLES?

17:16.266 --> 17:19.269
I WAS THERE FOR YOU, ELLIE!

17:19.269 --> 17:21.541
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BE OUT THERE DOING THINGS

17:21.541 --> 17:23.543
THAT I KNOW ARE STUPID,

17:23.543 --> 17:26.146
AND PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY
TALKING ABOUT ME.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.379
BUT THE LAST PERSON I THOUGHT
WHO WOULD EVER SAY MEAN THINGS

17:29.379 --> 17:32.422
IS MY BEST FRIEND!

17:32.422 --> 17:37.187
ELLIE, ARE YOU STILL THERE?

17:37.187 --> 17:39.759
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING OUT.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.663
YOU DIDN'T SMILE AT STAN?

17:43.663 --> 17:47.237
ONLY FOR THREE WEEKS.

17:47.237 --> 17:51.341
THEY WANT ANOTHER ROUND.
I FEEL LIKE I'M 100.

17:51.341 --> 17:55.175
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE 800.
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN
THE ENDLESS PARADE OF GIRLS

17:55.175 --> 17:58.108
YOU'VE BROUGHT HOME,
TAGGED AND RELEASED.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.310
NO MATTER HOW YOUNG THEY ARE,
YOU DON'T EVER SEEM

18:00.310 --> 18:04.284
THE SLIGHTEST BIT SELF-CONSCIOUS
ABOUT YOUR AGE.
I'M NOT.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.516
SHOW ME HOW TO DO THAT.

18:06.516 --> 18:10.089
I CAN'T. YOU SEE, WHEN WOMEN
GET OLDER, IT'S ICKY.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.692
WHEN MEN GET OLDER,
IT'S ADORABLE.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.794
IT'S ACTUALLY
MY FAVORITE DOUBLE STANDARD.

18:14.794 --> 18:19.199
YEAH, I'M NOT A HUGE FAN.
MM.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.430
(grunts)

18:20.430 --> 18:22.372
MY, MY.

18:22.372 --> 18:24.334
I HURT MYSELF HIKING.

18:24.334 --> 18:26.806
NO, YOU DIDN'T. DARLING,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ATTEMPT

18:26.806 --> 18:30.340
A MOVE LIKE THAT, YOU GOTTA
HIT THE YOGA CLASS HARD.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.642
в™Єв™Є

18:34.514 --> 18:36.886
HI. I'M BARB.

18:36.886 --> 18:38.318
WOW.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.354
UH... WAIT.
WHERE'S YOUR DRINK?

18:44.354 --> 18:46.856
I DON'T EVEN WANT IT.

18:46.856 --> 18:49.359
I'M JUST GONNA BORROW
SOME ICE FROM THIS ONE.

18:49.359 --> 18:52.332
AH. OHH.
THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DONE.

18:52.332 --> 18:55.505
BUT SATURDAY NIGHT IS
THE BEST NIGHT FOR GOING OUT.

18:55.505 --> 19:00.710
SWEETIE, IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE
TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF ME.

19:00.710 --> 19:02.412
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

19:02.412 --> 19:04.274
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.

19:04.274 --> 19:07.247
I'M GOING OUT.

19:09.219 --> 19:12.782
(cell phone rings)
HEY, MOM. WHAT'S UP?
WHY ARE YOU CALLING?

19:12.782 --> 19:15.585
I JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR VOICE
BEFORE I WENT TO SLEEP

19:15.585 --> 19:18.328
IN CASE I NEVER WAKE UP.
T-MINUS FIVE, GOOSE.

19:18.328 --> 19:21.761
OKAY, GOTTA GO, MOM.
LOVE YOU. BYE.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.234
(tires screech)

19:24.234 --> 19:26.766
(falsetto voice)
THIS IS FOR MY MOM!
AAH! (grunting)

19:26.766 --> 19:28.898
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

19:28.898 --> 19:31.241
OH, MY GOD!
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!

19:31.241 --> 19:35.245
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
FLOOR IT! FLOOR IT!

19:35.245 --> 19:39.279
HEY. I SAW THAT LIMO DRIVER
HELP YOU IN.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.412
DID YOU COME OVER HERE
TO MAKE FUN OF ME?

19:42.412 --> 19:44.714
NO, I CAME OVER
TO CHECK ON YOU.

19:44.714 --> 19:46.386
SO HOW ARE YOU?

19:46.386 --> 19:49.419
YOUNGER PEOPLE JUST DON'T
GET TIRED LIKE WE DO.

19:49.419 --> 19:51.321
I KNOW.

19:51.321 --> 19:53.693
BUT ONE DAY THEY WILL.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.397
AND IF WE'RE NOT DEAD,
I SAY WE RUB IT IN THEIR FACES.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.869
I'M SORRY I WAS MEAN.

19:59.869 --> 20:01.901
THAT'S OKAY.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.405
I'M NEVER GONNA HAVE
MY 20s AGAIN, AM I?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.407
OF COURSE YOU ARE,

20:07.407 --> 20:09.809
BUT JUST NOT TWO NIGHTS
IN A ROW.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.642
BUT YOU HAD A GREAT
FIRST NIGHT, RIGHT?
YEAH.

20:12.642 --> 20:16.416

I BET YOU HAVE GREAT STORIES.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.249

ON MY CELL PHONE HERE.

20:19.249 --> 20:22.892
LOOK AT THIS.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.272

20:55.325 --> 20:57.457

20:57.457 --> 21:00.760
I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR THE $6 OF BUSINESS

21:00.760 --> 21:03.533
THAT YOU PERSONALLY GAVE ME
LAST NIGHT IN AN EFFORT TO SHOW

21:03.533 --> 21:08.368
THAT YOU COULD STILL HANG
WITH THE YOUNGSTERS.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO--
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.270
YOU'RE OUT HERE WITH YOUR PAPER
WAITING FOR ME!
TO MAKE FUN OF YOU.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.873
IT STILL COUNTS.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.406

21:27.917 --> 21:30.420

seat belt alert chimes)

21:30.420 --> 21:32.762

21:32.762 --> 21:35.365
