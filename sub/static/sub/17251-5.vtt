IMPRESSIVE THING ABOUT THAT IS?

00:34.902 --> 00:36.670

00:36.704 --> 00:38.038
THE FACT THAT YOU DIDN'T
EAT THE PICKLE SLICE

00:38.072 --> 00:39.407
WHEN IT FELL
ON THE FLOOR.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.375
CALL ME BACK AFTER

00:48.082 --> 00:49.450
IF THEY GOT A GAY PLAYER

01:09.903 --> 01:12.773

02:03.891 --> 02:06.294
I'D BE TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF YOU.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.429
- THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
- OH, GOD.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.865
UM--I'M TRYING

BE CAREFUL.
- OH, OH, WHOA!

02:53.040 --> 02:54.308
[groan]

02:54.342 --> 02:56.844

03:15.263 --> 03:16.664
[chuckling]

03:16.697 --> 03:19.833

[chuckling]

03:54.001 --> 03:55.303
- ON A SCALE OF
ONE TO DEAN MARTIN,

03:55.336 --> 03:56.970
HOW DRUNK

04:06.079 --> 04:07.448
- YEAH.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.383

- YEAH, IT WAS.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.285
- AND I WAS THINKING--
- UH-OH.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.753
- IT COULD BE FUN AGAIN.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.121
- YOU MEAN, LIKE,

04:14.154 --> 04:15.956
- NOPE. RIGHT NOW MY HEAD

04:18.859 --> 04:20.494
WE ARE BOTH BUSY.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.497
I MISS YOU.
YOU MISS ME.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.799
- MM-HMM.
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

04:25.833 --> 04:26.934
YOU WANT TO

04:38.546 --> 04:41.849
- REALLY?

04:41.882 --> 04:44.352
- I--YOU WANT
TO JUST HAVE SEX

04:44.385 --> 04:45.786
WITH ME A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK

04:45.819 --> 04:47.087
WITHOUT ANY OF
THE RELATIONSHIP-Y STUFF?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.522
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE PROPOSING?

04:48.556 --> 04:51.325
- YEAH. IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I AM PROPOSING.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.826
- UH--
[laughs]

04:52.860 --> 04:54.027
- WHAT?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.529
- NOTHING.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.330
- YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.965
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.199
BUT I DON'T THINK--
- I CAN DO THIS.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.668
- I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO THIS.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.270
- NO DATING, NO DINNERS,
NO LONG TALKS

05:03.303 --> 05:04.938
OR TEXTING AFTER,
NO STAYING OVER.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.474
WE JUST GET TOGETHER,
HAVE A BLAST

05:06.507 --> 05:07.975
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.643
IT DOESN'T EVEN
MEAN ANYTHING.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.379
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.046
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.884
IT'S JUST PURE,
RAW ANIMAL DESIRE.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.823
WHAT?

05:22.856 --> 05:25.125
- I MEAN THIS IS
EVERY GUY'S FANTASY.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.361
A GORGEOUS GIRL WANTS TO
HOOK UP WITHOUT ANY ATTACHMENTS.

05:27.395 --> 05:30.364
- WELL.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.200
- I'M IN.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.368
- COOL.
- COOL.

05:34.402 --> 05:37.070

- OKAY.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.177

05:44.211 --> 05:45.245
- WELL, HERE WE DO IT.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.014
- WE'RE DOING IT.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.181
- YOU JUST HAVE A--
- WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.884
- NEVER MIND.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.254
- JUST 'CAUSE
YOU CLINKED ON IT,

05:54.287 --> 05:55.889
DOESN'T MEAN SHIT.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.324
- I DON'T KNOW,
CLINKING CAN BE

05:57.357 --> 05:58.692
PRETTY SERIOUS STUFF
WHEN IT COMES TO GIRLS.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.993
- THANK YOU, BRIAN.
- I CLINKED ON A BET

06:00.027 --> 06:01.529
WITH MY COUSIN MAGDA ONCE...
- YEAH?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.196
- ENDED UP TAKING HER
TO FOUR DIFFERENT WEDDINGS.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.732
AND BELIEVE ME,
IT WAS NOT LIKE THE MOVIE.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.866
- SO YOU DON'T THINK
THAT TWO PEOPLE

06:05.899 --> 06:07.067
CAN HAVE SEX
THAT'S JUST SEX?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.869
- NO. I THINK TWO PEOPLE
CAN DO IT.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.504
I'VE SEEN FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE
DO IT AT THE SAME TIME.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.072
I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO IT.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.541
- NO. SEINFELD DID IT.
- NO, HE DIDN'T.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.708
THAT WAS THE POINT
OF THE EPISODE.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.076
- HEY, WHO DO YOU THINK
WE'D BE?

06:16.109 --> 06:17.545
YOU'D BE JERRY, OF COURSE.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.112
YOU'D BE GEORGE...
- WHAT?

06:19.146 --> 06:22.015
- AND I'D BE KRAMER
AND ELAINE.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.417
- I DON'T GET WHY YOU
GET TO BE ELAINE.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.419
I'M A MUCH BETTER ELAINE.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.758
HEY, WHERE'S THE PATIENT?
- OH, HELLO.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.292
ACTUALLY, BEFORE
YOU GUYS COME IN HERE,

06:32.325 --> 06:33.527
CAN I JUST FIND OUT
YOUR DISCLOSURE POLICY?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.128
I THINK WE'RE OWED THAT.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.430
- WHAT?

06:36.464 --> 06:39.533
- ANSWER ME
THESE QUESTIONS THREE.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.035
- OKAY, BOYS, LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE OURSELVES A WIZARD.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.604
- NO, NO.
OKAY, LISTEN.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.739
YOU GUYS, DO WE HAVE
DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.140
- HEY, RELAX.
WE'RE NOT COPS.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.876
- WE'RE JUST HERE
TO HELP YOU GUYS.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.745
- YOU HAVE ANSWERED CORRECTLY.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.647
- DO YOU GRANT US
SAFE PASSAGE?

06:53.681 --> 06:55.248
- OH, BRIAN, COME ON.
- THAT'S GOOD, OKAY, SORRY.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.084
- WE WERE TOLD THAT SOMEONE
WAS STRUCK

06:57.117 --> 06:58.486
BY SOME SORT OF
SPORTING EQUIPMENT.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.588
- [chuckle]
OH, NOT STRUCK BRO, IMPALED.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.055
- HE GOT STUCK
BY HIS OWN JART.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.257
- HE SELF-JARTED.
- THE MAN SELF-JARTED.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.292
[indistinct chatter]

07:05.325 --> 07:07.027
- OOH.
[sigh]

07:09.597 --> 07:11.398
[overlapping chatter]

07:11.431 --> 07:13.066
- THIS COULDN'T BE
OUR CUSTOMER RIGHT HERE,

07:13.100 --> 07:15.235
COULD IT?

07:15.268 --> 07:16.937
- SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN PEOPLE GET DRUNK?

07:16.970 --> 07:20.608
THEY DO STUPID SHIT THAT
THEY'LL REGRET LATER ON.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.309
- ALL RIGHT, GUY,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.645
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.747
- WE'VE GOT AN
ALCOHOL-RELATED INJURY.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.115
THE PATIENT HAS
WHAT APPEARS TO BE

07:28.148 --> 07:29.416
A LAWN DART
LODGED IN HIS BACK.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
OBVIOUS CASE OF L.M.C.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.453
- L.M.C.?
- LOW MARBLE COUNT.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.022
- [laughs]
THAT IS AWESOME.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.857
- THAT IS AWESOME.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.458
- I THOUGHT THEY OUTLAWED
THESE THINGS IN THE '80s?

07:38.492 --> 07:39.960
- OH, YEAH. WE'RE, LIKE,
TOTALLY OFF THE GRID.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.129
- NONE OF THIS
IS HAPPENING, MAN.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.997
- BUT IF IT WERE HAPPENING,
THEN THIS WOULD BE

07:44.031 --> 07:46.299
THE NORTH SIDE
JART INVITATIONAL.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.169
AND YOU WOULD BE
WATCHING THE SEMIFINALS.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.270
- YES.
- OH.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.304
IS THIS, LIKE,
A GROUP THING,

07:51.338 --> 07:53.641
OR AN INDIVIDUAL SPORT, OR--

07:53.674 --> 07:55.976
- IT'S FOUR TEAMS OF FOUR,
ROUND-ROBIN PLAY.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.811
THE JART MUST BE THROWN
AT LEAST AS HIGH AS THAT

07:57.845 --> 07:59.713
THIRD STORY APARTMENT WINDOW,
BUT NO HIGHER

07:59.747 --> 08:01.381

SUNSHADE.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.517

THE SUNSHADE ISN'T OUT?

08:03.551 --> 08:04.852

THIS THING DIDN'T HIT AN ARTERY.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.965
- I THINK YOU MEAN
A JARTERY.

08:17.998 --> 08:18.966
[laughter]

08:18.999 --> 08:22.035
- NEXT ONE GETS A PUNCH.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.303

HEY, HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS
ARE JUST IN RELATIONSHIPS

08:36.283 --> 08:39.720

08:41.521 --> 08:45.225
- HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS

08:49.229 --> 08:50.598
- I NEED YOU
TO LIE STILL, SIR.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.032
- I CAN'T GET A GOOD ANGLE.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.567
LIKE, I WANT TO GET
THE JART IN MY BACK.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.168
BUT I WANT MY FACE
TO BE, LIKE,

08:55.202 --> 08:56.503
"WHAT JART IN MY BACK?"

08:56.536 --> 08:58.071
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS IN YOUR BACK?

08:58.105 --> 08:59.206
YOUR SPINE.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.240
- GIVE ME THAT.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.010
DON'T MOVE.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.712
- HOW DO I LOOK?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.346
- LIKE A DAMN HORS D'OEUVRE.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.415
- YES, THAT'S THE CAPTION.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.350
OH, SHIT.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.921

09:17.290 --> 09:18.525
IT'S YOU I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.193
- YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME?
- YEP.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.895
- BRO, IT'S A NO-BRAINER.
IT'S JUST SEX.

09:21.929 --> 09:22.696
IT'S THE PART OF
THE RELATIONSHIP I'M GOOD AT.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.564
HOW CAN I SCREW THIS UP?

09:24.598 --> 09:26.366
- BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU,
AND BECAUSE UNDERNEATH

09:26.399 --> 09:28.468
THAT SPORTS-LOVING MAN'S-MAN
GUY'S-GUY HEART OF YOURS

09:28.501 --> 09:29.970

09:30.003 --> 09:31.271
NOW I DON'T MEAN THAT
IN A BAD WAY.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.539
IT'S A LOVING,
SUPPORTIVE VAGINA.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.707
- AW.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.108

LIKE A GOOD THING.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.276
- IT'S NOT.
- LOOK.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.911
YOU'RE NOT IN IT
FOR THE ACTION.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.880
YOU LIKE THE TALKING
AND THE EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.281
FACE THE FACTS, BRO.
- I LIKE THE SEX.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.083
I CAN DO THIS.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.552
- YOU'RE GONNA STEP ON
YOUR OWN DICK HERE, PAL.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.620
- WHICH ONE IS IT?

09:46.654 --> 09:49.723
DO I HAVE A DICK
OR A VAGINA?

09:49.757 --> 09:53.526
- HE HAS BOTH, ACTUALLY,
IN A GOOD WAY.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.636
- NOTHING WRONG WITH A MAN

10:02.670 --> 10:04.504
WHO'S GOT A LITTLE
SQUISH MITTEN IN HIM.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.481
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

10:14.514 --> 10:16.316
WHAT YOU
CALL YOUR PRIVATE STUFF.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.617
- LOOK.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.286
WHEN I STARTED HERE
20 YEARS AGO,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.121
IT WAS JUST YOU,
DOYLE, STEGS,

10:21.154 --> 10:22.589
AND A BUNCH OF GUYS TALKING
ABOUT YOUR DICKS ALL DAY.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.424
NOW, IT'S A NEW WORLD.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.826
WE GOT SOME GIRLS UP IN HERE
AND WE'RE GONNA

10:25.859 --> 10:28.195
CALL OUR BUSINESS
WHATEVER WE WANT.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.297
HAM WALLET.
- MM-HMM.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.432
- YOU HAD TO START IN
WITH THE SEX TALK.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.533
- IT WASN'T ME.
IT WAS HANK.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.268
- BIRTH CANNON.
- CHA-CHA.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.438
- THE VELVETEEN RABBIT.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.273
THAT WAS MY SISTER'S
FAVORITE BOOK.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.308
I TOTALLY RUINED IT
FOR HER.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.943
[laughter]

10:42.976 --> 10:44.544
- YOU'RE A SENSITIVE MAN,
FARRELL.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.979
YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF GIRL IN YOU.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.514
AND I, FOR ONE,
AM GONNA GO ON RECORD

10:47.547 --> 10:49.516
AS SAYING I FIND THAT
VERY ATTRACTIVE.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.484
- THERE ARE ACTUALLY
SEVERAL VARIETIES

10:51.518 --> 10:53.220
OF FISH THAT
ARE HERMAPHRODITIC.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.055
IN FACT, THERE'S ONE SPECIES
OFF THE COAST

10:55.088 --> 10:57.825
OF AUSTRALIA THAT CAN
GROW THE OTHER GENITALIA,

10:57.858 --> 11:00.193
AND HAVE SEX WITH ITSELF
WHENEVER IT WANTS.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.528
- REALLY?

11:01.561 --> 11:03.697
- WHAT IS IT CALLED?
- A HAPPY GODDAMN FISH.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.298
[laughter]

11:05.332 --> 11:06.900
- I NEED A RULING, HERE.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.069
DO YOU THINK THE JART QUALIFIES
AS AN IMPALEMENT?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.303
- SURE, IF IT'S POKING OUT
OF A GUY'S

11:10.337 --> 11:11.471
SHOULDER MEAT LIKE THAT.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.040

11:13.073 --> 11:14.908

BUCKET LIST IN THERE.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.878
THE THINGS HE HOPES TO SEE
AND DO ON THE JOB.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.646
- IMPALEMENT IS NUMBER ONE.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.881
- CASH, COME ON.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.582
- YOU STOP
EATING MY TWIXES,

11:22.615 --> 11:24.718
I'LL STOP READING STUFF

11:24.752 --> 11:26.486
- DELIVERING A BABY--
YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.821
- WE DELIVERED A BABY
LAST MONTH.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.656
HE WOULDN'T LET ME
KEEP THE PLACENTA.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.591
- YOU'VE ALREADY
GOT AN UMBILICAL CORD.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.260
- NARCAN?
- YEAH.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.028
THE THING WHERE
YOU JAB A PERSON WITH IT,

11:35.062 --> 11:36.563
AND BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE,
LIKE IN PULP FICTION.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.198
- I FORGOT IT WAS
EVEN CALLED NARCAN.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.499
SEVEN YEARS ON THE JOB,
I'VE ONLY SEEN,

11:39.532 --> 11:40.734
LIKE, TWO DEAD JUNKIES.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.202

11:46.774 --> 11:48.575
AND WE SHOW UP AND
THEY AIN'T EVEN DEAD.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.177
- AND THEY'RE USUALLY RANTING
AND RAVING

11:50.210 --> 11:52.379
AND THROWING CRAZY
JACKIE CHAN KARATE KICKS.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.848
- HAD THIS ONE GUY
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO

11:54.882 --> 11:57.250
WAVING A MACHETE AROUND,
SCREAMING ABOUT

11:57.284 --> 11:58.852
BEING OBAMA'S COUSIN.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.354
IT TURNS OUT
HE ACTUALLY WAS.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.557
[phone chimes]

12:04.591 --> 12:07.928
- IT'S THERESA, AND SHE
WANTS TO HOOK UP TONIGHT.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.897

DON'T SCREW THIS UP.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.799

12:13.600 --> 12:14.935

- WHAT?

12:14.968 --> 12:17.637
- OR I THINK I MIGHT
BE PART MACHINE,

12:17.670 --> 12:19.807
BECAUSE I LIKE SEX WITHOUT
ANY EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.441
- RIGHT?
WHO DOESN'T?

12:21.474 --> 12:23.710
- YOU...LOVE TACO.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.413
- SHUT UP, DICK.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.917

12:32.685 --> 12:33.887
- OH, SORRY.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.655
- IT'S OKAY.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.758
YOU WERE FOCUSED,
AND IT PAID OFF.

12:38.792 --> 12:39.626
- I WAS...
- MM-HMM.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.428
- WASN'T I?

12:41.461 --> 12:42.462
I THINK THAT MY FOCUS
HAS IMPROVED

12:42.495 --> 12:43.630
SINCE I GOT INTO TENNIS.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.932
- YOU'RE PLAYING TENNIS?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.566
- NO, I WAS JUST WATCHING IT.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.734
BUT IF YOU DON'T
REALLY CONCENTRATE,

12:47.767 --> 12:48.836
IT GETS SUPER BORING.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.304
- [giggles]
- YOU HUNGRY?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.573
- WHOA, HOLD ON THERE,

NO HANGING AROUND,

12:57.110 --> 13:00.580
NO FOOD, JUST SEX,

- RIGHT, RIGHT.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.085
HOW ABOUT A SANDWICH?

13:05.118 --> 13:08.588
- SORRY, THAT FALLS
UNDER THE FOOD RULE.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.457
- YOU SAID, "NO DINNER."

13:10.490 --> 13:12.025
IF I'D KNOWN SANDWICHES
WERE OFF THE TABLE,

13:12.059 --> 13:13.293
I MIGHT NOT
HAVE AGREED TO THIS.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.627
- HEY, WE HAVE
TO HAVE BOUNDARIES

13:14.661 --> 13:16.429
OR THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.868
- IT JUST DID WORK, BABE.
TWICE-ISH.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.269
AND A LOT OF WHAT
I JUST DID,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.604
HONEY, FUELED BY SANDWICHES.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.580
I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.830

13:50.864 --> 13:52.299
- AH, A LITTLE BIT.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.867
YES.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.903
- BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T
GIVE YOU A SANDWICH?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.737
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.539
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO TIP YOUR HAT,

13:59.572 --> 14:01.408
THANK HER FOR THE SEX,
AND GET YOUR OWN SANDWICH.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.210
IT'S CHICAGO,
YOU CAN'T WALK FIVE FEET

14:03.243 --> 14:04.811
WITHOUT RUNNING
INTO A GODDAMN SANDWICH.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.546
- IT'S A VERY GOOD
SANDWICH TOWN.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.282
- SHE TAPPED ME
ON THE ASS.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.987
- I THINK A LOT OF GUYS
WOULD LIKE

14:14.021 --> 14:16.056
TO HAVE THERESA TAP THEM
ON THE ASS.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.992
NOT ME, JUST RANDOM GUYS.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.560
- I TAP GUYS ON THE ASS

14:20.593 --> 14:21.728
AS THEY LEAVE MY APARTMENT
ALL THE GODDAMN TIME.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.163
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.098

14:29.069 --> 14:30.103
AND I DON'T CARE

14:30.137 --> 14:31.771
THAT'S A MATTER OF MANNERS.
