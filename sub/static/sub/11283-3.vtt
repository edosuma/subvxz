WEBVTT

00:06.307 --> 00:08.207
You good?

00:08.209 --> 00:10.259
Yeah.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.310
If something goes wrong,
that package has to go off.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.779
That's the deal--
Victor's orders.

00:13.781 --> 00:14.780
Right.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.148
Don't let us down.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.750
We've got one shot at this.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.218
I know.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.320
SAM:
This building has 15 floors.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.711
The Department of Immigration
takes up

00:22.712 --> 00:24.101
the first floor
and the lower plaza.

00:24.102 --> 00:25.491
If they're after
civilians, then he's

00:25.493 --> 00:27.526
gonna be targeting the
open immigration areas.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.767
We have a visual on Trent.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.538
Trent.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.809
I've got a bomb!

00:43.811 --> 00:45.077
(bystanders screaming)

00:53.054 --> 00:55.587
MAN:<i> My grandfather kneeled down</i>
<i> to kiss him good-bye.</i>

00:55.589 --> 00:57.156
My dad's only five.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.609
He's got no idea.

00:59.610 --> 01:02.061
He told me how the wool uniform
felt rough against his chest,

01:02.063 --> 01:04.530
and he says to my dad...

01:05.833 --> 01:09.268
"You take care, now.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.336
You take care."

01:13.107 --> 01:15.274
So let's fast-forward.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.209
My dad and my mom--
they're living hand to mouth

01:17.211 --> 01:18.444
'cause no one's going
to give

01:18.446 --> 01:20.112
a white guy over 40 a job.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.314
He can't afford to live
in his own neighborhood,

01:22.316 --> 01:24.750
his own neighborhood
where he grew up.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.786
So who is living there,

01:27.788 --> 01:29.421
living in his house,

01:29.423 --> 01:31.356
working his job?

01:31.358 --> 01:33.425
It's not you

01:33.427 --> 01:34.593
or you

01:34.595 --> 01:37.162
or any of you.

01:37.164 --> 01:40.766
I'm sorry, boys, but your skin
is just too white.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.135
When I think
about my grandfather,

01:43.136 --> 01:45.503
who gave his life on that beach
in France for his country...

01:46.841 --> 01:48.307
...then I see these people,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.259
you know, this...

01:50.260 --> 01:52.210
"rainbow of diversity"
pouring in like sewage

01:52.213 --> 01:53.645
by the multiculti boatload,

01:53.647 --> 01:58.317
who will be one in two of us
by 2050-- one in two--

01:58.319 --> 02:02.287
and I am thinking:
wow, this is a smiling,

02:02.289 --> 02:05.891
slow-moving army of occupation,

02:05.893 --> 02:08.494
and I will not live
with the shame

02:08.496 --> 02:12.731
when one day a young man with
my name turns to me and says,

02:12.733 --> 02:14.533
"Dad, I can't
get a job.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.568
"I can't afford a
decent place to live.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.871
"The cockroaches stole
everything from us.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.606
"Why didn't you do
something?

02:20.608 --> 02:23.242
Why didn't you
do something?"

02:23.244 --> 02:25.244
Well, guess what.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.446
We are going to do something
about it.

02:27.448 --> 02:30.182
We are going to do
something about it,

02:30.184 --> 02:31.750
'cause today is Citizenship Day

02:31.752 --> 02:33.552
and we are going
to celebrate it our way.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.820
Yes, we are!
(cheering)

02:34.822 --> 02:35.888
Our way!

02:35.890 --> 02:37.890
Yeah!
You boys are
the future.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.424
You are the future.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.428
My man...
Yeah.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.466
Derek,

02:47.468 --> 02:49.535
you're up.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.384
It's the old glass factory.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.553
There's 23 guys on the inside.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.754
I don't know the targets,
but he said

03:08.755 --> 03:09.954
a lot of people
are gonna get hurt.

03:09.957 --> 03:10.956
Look, I got to go.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.891
(dialing)

03:14.862 --> 03:17.196
(line ringing)

03:17.198 --> 03:18.664
Come on, come on,
Kel, pick up, pick up.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.665
WOMAN:
This is Kelly.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.300
You know what to do.
(beep)

03:21.302 --> 03:22.568
Hey, Kel, it's me.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.938
Uh, listen, I'm calling...

03:25.940 --> 03:27.372
No reason--
I'm, I'm just calling...

03:27.374 --> 03:29.241
(door opens)
I love you.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.243
(door closes)

03:31.245 --> 03:32.578
What are you doing?
Nothing.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.480
You talking to her?

03:34.481 --> 03:36.381
Look, Trent, we got to talk.
I got nothing to
say about that.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.583
It's about Victor.
What?

03:37.585 --> 03:39.551
His plan.
Yeah, it's need-to-know.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.653
Trent...
He'll tell me
when it's my turn.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.754
Trent!
You want me to tell him you
got a phone in your pocket?

03:43.757 --> 03:46.491
Yeah, I didn't think so.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.895
(door opens)

03:56.570 --> 03:58.570
Okay, guys, listen up.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.640
12:45 p.m.--
an unidentified male called 911

04:01.642 --> 04:04.676
to report a series of attacks
planned for today.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.612
Multiple bombs,
targets unknown.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.247
Caller give
a deadline?

04:08.249 --> 04:10.482
No, he did not.
The attacks are
racially motivated.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.018
The leader is Victor Ackland.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.419
What do we know about him?

04:14.421 --> 04:15.587
PARKER:
Not a whole lot.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.055
Five years ago
he was red-flagged

04:17.056 --> 04:18.522
for handing out
white supremacist literature

04:18.525 --> 04:20.259
on university campuses.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.293
He ran
with the Aryans.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.395
Now he looks
like he's gone indie.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.963
He's got no record,
no Web site.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.531
He's a little under the radar.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.368
Home base is
this abandoned glass factory.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.637
There are 23 subjects,
and they are armed.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.273
We got to get them before
they put their plan in play.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.342
We're gonna come at 'em
from the east,

04:36.343 --> 04:38.410
split into north-south
while Spike does his thing.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.978
Team four...
We hit from the west.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.280
That's right.
Extra cuffs,

04:41.282 --> 04:42.514
kids, we're going to need 'em.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.583
Let's go, guys, let's go.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.821
You're next.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.723
Then it's you.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.493
MAN: Yeah, man, I'm so ready.
It's been a long time coming.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.861
MAN 2:
Definitely.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.665
Trent, we gotta talk.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.400
Talk to me here.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.571
Hey, outside.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.506
Yeah, you can say what you need
to say in front of them.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.474
Look, I'm not playing around.
Don't touch me.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.377
Okay?! Is there something
you want

05:12.379 --> 05:13.378
to talk
about here, Danny?

05:13.380 --> 05:14.379
This is between us!

05:14.381 --> 05:15.714
I'm not a kid anymore!

05:15.716 --> 05:17.916
ACKLAND:
Boys!

05:17.918 --> 05:20.719
Is there something
I should know about?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.402
Anything, Eddie?

05:37.404 --> 05:40.038
No movement.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.073
Spike?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.607
They got a network
of security cams.

05:42.609 --> 05:45.811
Wireless, which is good.
We knock out

05:45.813 --> 05:48.413
camera two, we've added
15 degrees zone of entry.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.615
Knock out camera four,
we gain another 20 degrees.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.950
Nice.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.020
Dangerous with a rifle,
deadly with geometry.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.124
Come on, camera four,
you can't hide for long.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.594
Your consumer-grade encryption
means nothing to me.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.964
Gotcha!

06:05.966 --> 06:08.133
Okay, recording a ten-second
loop of clean video.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.568
ED:
Zone-by-zone.
Stay in contact.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.802
Spike, you're looking
for explosives.

06:10.804 --> 06:11.970
Copy that.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.772
Camera's looped.
We're ready to go.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.741
All right, let's do it.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.676
Team Four, let's move in.
Copy that.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.544
Let's go.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.752
You getting cold feet, Danny?

06:26.754 --> 06:30.389
No, man, no way.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.461
You sure about that, buddy?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.533
I'm sure.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.834
Hmm. 'Cause we've been seeing

06:42.836 --> 06:44.836
a little less of you
around here.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.605
It's the job. They got me
working weekends.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.673
You got a girlfriend
who's got you on a leash.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.810
(cell phone vibrating)

07:03.424 --> 07:05.090
What are you doing with this?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.192
What did I say
about cell phones?

07:08.462 --> 07:11.496
(alarm blaring)

07:14.768 --> 07:15.867
Status!

07:15.869 --> 07:17.068
Malcolm!

07:18.505 --> 07:20.572
It's impossible.
I didn't see anything!

07:21.775 --> 07:23.442
Troy, what the hell's going on?!

07:23.443 --> 07:25.110
Double trip wire at the other
gate. We missed it.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.077
Copy.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.612
The system's been hacked.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.681
It's looped.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.819
Let's go in aggressive.
Guys, split up now.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.786
Let's go!
Let's go!

07:41.862 --> 07:42.861
Cops all over us!

07:42.863 --> 07:44.229
Okay, this is not a drill!

07:44.231 --> 07:45.764
You know what to do!

07:45.766 --> 07:46.965
Trent, we've gotta get
out of here.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.066
Did you know
about this?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.668
I don't want you
getting hurt!
Come on!

07:49.670 --> 07:50.802
Get to your stations!

07:50.804 --> 07:52.671
Trent, let's go.
I'll go with you!

07:52.673 --> 07:54.940
You want to prove your loyalty,
you get to your station!

07:55.809 --> 07:56.775
Let's go!
Moving out!

07:56.777 --> 07:58.510
Moving out!
Moving out!

08:02.783 --> 08:04.916
(whispers): Three.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.697
(coughing)

08:18.699 --> 08:20.749
Down on the ground!
On the ground!

08:20.750 --> 08:22.800
On the ground now!
Hands where we can see them!

08:23.670 --> 08:25.136
(men wheezing)

08:25.138 --> 08:26.505
We have three in custody.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.906
Copy.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.885
Door, door, door, door!

08:44.591 --> 08:46.892
Right there! Right there!
All right let's get him.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.894
Let's get him up!
Get him up! Come on!

08:48.896 --> 08:49.761
Get up.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.531
Get him up, let's go.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.765
Subject secure.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.166
Entry here?

08:55.168 --> 08:57.702
Team Four's coming in
the other side.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.070
Let's stick to the script.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.731
(gunshot)

09:26.733 --> 09:28.800
Shooter! Shooter Take cover!

09:28.802 --> 09:30.735
Take cover!
Shooter!

09:32.172 --> 09:33.572
ED:
Greg!

09:33.574 --> 09:34.907
Greg!

09:34.908 --> 09:36.241
The boss is hit!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.909
We're under fire!

09:40.681 --> 09:44.349
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

10:14.615 --> 10:16.681
Where is it? Let me see it.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.315
Greg?

10:17.316 --> 10:17.948
Greg?!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.684
I'm okay. I'm okay.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.186
WORDY: He took one in the arm
and one in the vest!

10:21.188 --> 10:23.655
Boss, we're gonna get you out
of here.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.757
Here, take this.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.260
Wordy, you got a visual?

10:30.697 --> 10:33.632
Yeah, it's gotta be coming
from the overhead walkway!

10:41.008 --> 10:42.707
I see him. Sam, status.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.842
Almost there.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.110
PARKER:
No...

10:45.112 --> 10:46.878
No, we need
to find those bombs.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.680
I hear you,
but not I'm listening. Sam?

10:48.682 --> 10:49.948
There's a door east of us.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.083
Take the walkway.
Let's get this guy.

10:52.085 --> 10:52.884
Copy that.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.994
(gunshots)

11:02.996 --> 11:04.763
WORDY:
Isn't right, boss.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.930
PARKER:
What do you mean?

11:05.932 --> 11:07.732
I'm the one supposed
to take the hits.

11:07.734 --> 11:08.967
Oh... (mutters)
(gunshots)

11:11.071 --> 11:14.706
(gunshots)

11:14.708 --> 11:16.274
Got another shooter.
Where?!

11:16.276 --> 11:18.209
To your left.
I'm gonna push him back.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.314
(gunshots)

11:24.785 --> 11:25.817
Spike, Sam, what's your 20?

11:25.819 --> 11:27.018
Nearly there.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.121
(gunshots)

11:31.091 --> 11:32.157
Trent?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.129
(gunshot)
Trent?

11:38.131 --> 11:40.198
(gunshot)
Malcolm.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.367
(groans)
Thought you were a cop.
What's going on?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.436
I got one in the arm.
Oh, yeah?

11:44.438 --> 11:46.738
Yeah. Now they're all trying
to help him-- pop, pop, pop.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.691
Give me a shot.
No way.

11:49.692 --> 11:51.208
No. Come on,
give me a shot.
You know how
to shoot the 47?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.477
Hell, yeah.
Come on.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.282
What the hell

11:57.284 --> 11:58.450
are you doing?

11:58.452 --> 12:00.085
He tossed the rifle.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.987
What the hell are you doing?!

12:02.989 --> 12:05.457
(grunting)

12:05.459 --> 12:07.125
Police!

12:07.127 --> 12:08.293
SRU!

12:08.295 --> 12:10.095
Stop right there!

12:10.097 --> 12:12.230
Get down!
Get down!

12:12.232 --> 12:13.231
Show us your hands!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.099
Stay down!

12:14.101 --> 12:15.200
Two subjects contained.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.434
Wordy, you see that ladder?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.236
(whizzing gunshots)

12:18.238 --> 12:19.304
I got it.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.139
I'm gonna keep him pinned.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.208
You okay?
Yeah.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.316
(panting, gunfire)

12:34.121 --> 12:35.420
(panting)

12:38.792 --> 12:41.226
(gunshots)

12:44.264 --> 12:47.132
(panting)

12:47.868 --> 12:49.134
Drop it! Drop it now!

12:49.136 --> 12:51.770
Put your gun down,
or I will shoot you!

12:51.772 --> 12:53.438
Now get on the ladder
and come down here.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.174
(panting)

12:56.176 --> 12:57.408
Move it!

12:57.410 --> 12:59.244
(panting)

12:59.246 --> 13:00.779
Get your hands on your head!

13:03.183 --> 13:05.350
Subject secure.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.255
JULES:
You okay?

13:10.257 --> 13:11.856
I'm good.
Let's move on.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.158
No. You need a medic.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.859
Boss, he's got it
contained.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.294
All right?
Let's get you some help.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.495
(sighs)
Come on.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.197
Spike?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.165
We need those explosives.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.499
I'm on it. You good?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.401
Yeah.
Team Four,
this is Scarlatti.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.869
Tell me what you got.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.272
Hey, hey, I need your help.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.074
I'm Daniel Butler. I'm the one
who called in the 911.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.410
You the guy that tossed
the rifle out the window?
Yeah.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.078
I'm looking
for my brother Trent.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.580
He's 17, he's wearing
a blue jacket.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.448
He's got to be in here
somewhere.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.085
Okay. Guys, I got someone
you're gonna want to meet.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.960
Hey, Medic!

13:50.096 --> 13:51.896
I'll wait my turn, thanks.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.432
Status?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.134
One subject down,
one injured.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.869
11 more in custody.
And we've got seven.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.170
That leaves three
unaccounted for.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.939
And one of them's
Victor Ackland.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.624
Sam, let's get Danny
Butler out here.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.308
PARKER:
Sidney, we get anything
else on Mr. Ackland?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.294
SIDNEY:
Nothing.

14:06.295 --> 14:08.278
No e-mail address,
no phone records, no trail.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.814
Our guy's unplugged.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.348
SIDNEY:
I got you one thing, though.
Victor was

14:11.351 --> 14:13.484
in military training
at Petawawa, '86

14:13.486 --> 14:15.420
to '90, but he never made it
into the field

14:15.422 --> 14:16.955
on account of his BCD.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.122
What's that?

14:18.124 --> 14:19.290
Big Chicken Dinner.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.892
Also known
as Bad Conduct Discharge.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.160
A failed soldier.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.229
Yeah. This guy can go
with the others.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.263
This is Danny.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.298
You can uncuff
him, Sam.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.499
Hey, Danny.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.435
Thanks for doing
the right thing today, son.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.038
My team's gonna need you.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.306
SPIKE:
Guys?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.308
I found some kind
of war room.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.977
There's maps.
Got points of interest.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.045
Jewish community center,
Chinese market,

14:41.047 --> 14:44.315
immigration center.
Multicultural
gathering spots.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.618
The targets they were
planning on hitting today.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.286
Well, they still may be.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.421
We've got three subjects
unaccounted for.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.023
Danny, you come with me.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.424
Spike, see what else
you can find.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.931
How's he doing?

14:59.933 --> 15:01.065
He's fine.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.333
He's lucky.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.501
Julianna.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.169
Steve Morgan.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.071
No way.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.974
Uh, he needs to get stitched
at the hospital.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.076
No, no, just patch it up.
I'll get it done later.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.444
Boss.
Just don't want you
to risk infection.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.313
It'll be fine
for a few hours.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.115
Let me get you
a painkiller.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.916
No, no, no, no, no. I got to
keep the mind sharp.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.153
You haven't changed.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.355
Neither have you.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.125
(chuckles)

15:27.127 --> 15:28.326
I'll be right back.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.261
I'm just gonna
grab some stuff.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.064
We should-- we should catch up.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.265
Yeah.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.199
Yeah, later.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.368
Yeah.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.309
He's not here.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.376
Who?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.011
Trent, his brother.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.313
What about these guys?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.081
Is anybody here missing?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.215
Victor--

15:51.217 --> 15:53.251
and Jeff Watts. He's
Victor's right hand.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.586
Think they're together?
They were the last
time I saw them.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.121
Okay, good, good.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.990
Get these guys on the bus.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.025
Wordy, what about the uniforms
on perimeter,

16:01.027 --> 16:02.594
they get anything?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.162
The property's too big.
There were gaps in the cordon.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.263
They could have got out.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.365
Okay.
All right, thanks, guys.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.300
Sidney, I need you to look
for vehicle registration

16:09.302 --> 16:10.335
for Victor Ackland,

16:10.337 --> 16:11.669
Jeff Watts and Trent Butler.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.339
Put out APB's.
Copy.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.275
Think I found what
we're looking for.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.644
We got nitroglycerin,
sulfuric acid,

16:19.646 --> 16:21.746
sodium trichlorate,
ammonia,

16:21.748 --> 16:25.016
gasoline,
silver nitrate, nitrobenzol.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.417
With the chemicals down here,

16:26.419 --> 16:29.087
they could have built
the mother of all bombs.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.755
Instead, they built
a bunch of smaller ones.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.224
Portable, easy to hide.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.592
But capable of causing damage?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.260
A hell of a lot of damage.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.363
The good news is I got plans
for ten bombs

16:38.365 --> 16:40.031
so I can find out how they work.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.399
Bad news?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.234
Three of them are missing.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.676
Sidney, we've got
three subjects

16:51.678 --> 16:53.378
carrying explosives.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.346
Contact all divisions.
Threat level is red.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.481
Copy.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.516
I'm uploading a list

16:58.518 --> 17:00.551
of possible targets.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.520
Sidney, we need uniforms,
checkpoints, dogs and scanners

17:02.522 --> 17:04.455
at all locations.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.557
That's a lot of ground to cover.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.726
You'll be fine, Sidney.
Just reach out to our friends

17:08.728 --> 17:11.029
in Peel and Durham,
and just get those photos out.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.697
Copy, boss.
All right,
Spike, what have you got?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.565
These bombs-- they're not meant
to take out buildings.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.067
They're meant
to take out people.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.403
It's loaded with shrapnel--
nails.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.238
Okay, what's the radius?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.073
You don't want to be within
a hundred feet when it blows.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.242
Trigger?

17:24.244 --> 17:25.343
Timers. They're hooked up

17:25.345 --> 17:26.711
to special frequency clocks--
T.A.I.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.479
They're all going to blow
at the same time.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.415
The problem is,
we don't know what time.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.651
And worse, they've all got
impact-sensitive override.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.820
Somebody drops one, it blows.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.089
That doesn't add up.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.590
Right-wing extremists
like to park a bomb

17:39.592 --> 17:41.759
underneath a government
building and walk away.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.761
They don't like to target
civilians with shrapnel.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.830
Ackland's sending a message
and causing carnage.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.632
The new face of terror.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.438
Hey.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.839
You're worried about
your brother?

17:54.841 --> 17:57.075
Yeah.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.210
I'm gonna be straight--
I don't get you yet.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.145
But at 12:45 today,
you made a call--

18:01.147 --> 18:02.447
you did the right thing.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.416
I didn't know.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.384
You ready to take a ride
with us? You ready to talk?

18:06.386 --> 18:07.385
Okay, come on.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.654
Let's go.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.729
There's a sad day when you can't
trust the people closest to you.

18:18.731 --> 18:22.300
You boys aren't
just soldiers to me.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.536
You're family.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.804
A family that chose each other.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.639
That runs even
deeper than blood.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.142
Trent, if you know
who tipped off the cops,

18:31.144 --> 18:32.443
you need to tell me.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.414
You need to tell me, Trent.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.717
I think it was Danny.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.254
That can't have been
easy for you.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.390
He called 911

18:46.392 --> 18:47.391
just before the raid.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.392
Hey!

18:48.394 --> 18:49.894
I'm sorry.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.630
Well, your brother's choices
aren't your fault.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.835
(sirens wailing)

18:59.139 --> 19:01.472
That's a long list
of targets, Danny.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.341
We need to know more
about Victor's plan today.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.909
I was going to be a lookout.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.476
He didn't tell me the targets.
Everything was need-to-know.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.512
You're a part of this group.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.280
No.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.617
I mean, I was, but...

19:12.619 --> 19:14.886
it was all just
talk before today.

19:14.888 --> 19:18.422
All right, look,
I used to think...

19:18.424 --> 19:20.424
We grew up north of the city.
Nice house.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.660
My dad bought it from his dad
when he retired.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.794
My dad lost
his job.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.796
He got let go 'cause
all of a sudden

19:25.798 --> 19:28.499
there's a bunch of people
that'll work for a lot less.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.567
Immigrants, Danny.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.202
We lost the house.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.771
He was depressed.
He starts drinking.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.374
And he makes sure that
we know who's to blame

19:36.376 --> 19:38.709
when there's no money
for Christmas, food.

19:38.711 --> 19:44.582
Then one day Trent and I come
home, and-and we find him.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.717
He took the easy way out.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.553
We're on our own.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.887
Your mom?

19:49.889 --> 19:52.223
She died when Trent was born.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.891
<i> I had to get him out.</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:56.427
<i> He didn't want to go,</i>
<i> but I swore to him</i>

19:56.429 --> 19:58.429
I was going to look out
for him.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.430
I was going to get a job and I
was going to take care of him.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.933
And I was going to fight back.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.434
ACKLAND:
<i> God, I remember</i>
<i> when I first saw Danny.</i>

20:03.436 --> 20:05.870
He was so angry,

20:05.872 --> 20:08.506
and lost.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.642
But I saw something,
saw something in him.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.712
<i> Pride, fire.</i>

20:14.714 --> 20:16.798
I had hopes.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.883
DANNY:
<i> Every time you'd see him,</i>
<i> you were happy to see him</i>

20:18.885 --> 20:20.518
<i> 'cause he'd listen.</i>

20:20.520 --> 20:21.786
<i> And Trent and I weren't</i>
<i> alone anymore.</i>

20:21.788 --> 20:23.988
Victor worked security
at the old factory.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.257
He had the run of the place.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.592
He's a military guy.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.411
And on the weekends
he'd drill us.

20:29.412 --> 20:31.229
Teach us survival skills,
stuff like that, just for fun.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.863
I was wrong.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.599
I thought I knew him.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.734
It's not him,
it's his girlfriend.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.636
Is that the one
who called before?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.438
Yeah, it's since he met her.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.373
He's not the same guy.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.613
DANNY:
<i> Kelly changed everything.</i>

20:48.615 --> 20:49.847
You got to meet her.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.949
She's just--
she's a force of nature.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.318
(chuckling)

20:54.320 --> 20:57.822
<i> I met her at work.</i>
<i> at the hotel.</i>

20:57.824 --> 21:00.958
<i> I tried keeping my distance,</i>
<i> but after a couple weeks,</i>

21:00.960 --> 21:03.427
<i> nothing I believed</i>
<i> made sense anymore.</i>

21:03.429 --> 21:04.962
TRENT:
Nice monkey suit.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.697
Hey, what are you
doing here?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.599
What do you mean?
It's Friday.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.568
Yeah, right.
Right, Friday.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.504
Uh, can you cover for me?

21:13.506 --> 21:15.539
Hey, you must be Trent.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.708
Yeah.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.043
The famous invisible brother.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.379
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.581
Who's this?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.283
It's just someone
I work with.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.984
Danny.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.719
What's
going on?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.023
So this is Kelly.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.792
Yeah. Hi.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.460
Danny, what the hell...?

21:38.831 --> 21:40.398
I was going to tell you.
When?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.034
When I thought
the time was right.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.669
How could you...?
Look, it's my
business, all right?

21:45.672 --> 21:47.905
Well, why'd you lie to me?
I didn't lie to you.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.041
You've got your pride
when it suits you,

21:50.043 --> 21:53.477
but this whole time you're
running around with that.
She is not a that!

21:53.479 --> 21:55.846
What are you doing?

21:55.848 --> 21:57.948
I don't know.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.785
You're deserting me.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.687
I would never...

22:02.689 --> 22:06.624
Hey, I would never
desert you.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.772
So, Trent,

22:21.774 --> 22:24.442
you ever meet this Kelly?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.645
Trent.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.580
No.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.883
How come you stayed
in the group?

22:32.885 --> 22:34.819
She wouldn't see me
after that.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.754
Going up on these weekends
was the only way

22:36.756 --> 22:38.823
to look out for him.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.658
Trent ever mention Kelly's color
to Victor?

22:40.660 --> 22:43.494
No.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.830
I guess I still have
a brother, you know?

22:48.835 --> 22:50.668
All right, let's go.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.845
You know who's left here?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.847
Just the three of us.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.081
Just Jeff and me
and you.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.783
It's down to us,

23:05.785 --> 23:07.385
and that's what it's all
about, right?

23:07.387 --> 23:08.719
Right.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.238
Hey...

23:10.239 --> 23:11.756
do you want to know
what the best thing

23:11.758 --> 23:12.923
that happened to me was?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.861
It's when your brother brought
you to me.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.065
I saved your briefing for last.
You ready?

23:22.635 --> 23:23.734
Yes.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.669
You want to know
what's in the backpacks?

23:25.671 --> 23:28.172
Yes.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.641
(sirens wailing)

23:30.643 --> 23:33.878
Boss, we've got an I.D.
on Jeff and Trent entering

23:33.880 --> 23:35.279
Hancock Square carrying
backpacks.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.679
They could be headed
to the Department

23:36.682 --> 23:37.982
of Citizenship and Immigration.
It's a target

23:37.984 --> 23:39.016
What about Victor Ackland?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.434
We got unis at all

23:40.435 --> 23:41.851
the targets,
but still no sign of him.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.455
Okay, radio ahead, let 'em
know we're on our way,

23:44.457 --> 23:45.856
but do not engage the subjects.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.024
You got it.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.193
Sidney, alert all units:
Victor Ackland is

23:49.195 --> 23:50.594
now traveling alone

23:50.596 --> 23:52.596
and in possible possession
of a third bomb.

23:52.598 --> 23:53.831
We're still looking
for backpacks.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.900
Keep the pressure up.
Copy, boss.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.902
(sirens wailing)

24:04.610 --> 24:06.877
You good?

24:06.879 --> 24:07.912
Yeah.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.647
Yeah?

24:09.649 --> 24:11.982
Yeah.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.851
My man.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.687
You're solo from here.
But when we're done,

24:16.689 --> 24:18.055
we'll meet
at the Fox and Crown,

24:18.057 --> 24:20.791
have a beer and watch it
on the news.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.965
Time it right,
you'll be fine.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.769
It's a lot people.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.437
It's like Victor said:

24:33.438 --> 24:35.104
"If the pilot of the<i> Enola Gay </i>
thought like that,

24:35.107 --> 24:36.674
we'd be speaking Japanese
right now."

24:38.144 --> 24:39.810
Don't worry.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.479
You wait,
you watch the time,

24:41.481 --> 24:43.547
and you put it down
nice and slow,

24:43.549 --> 24:46.116
and you make sure you're far
away by 3:00.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.118
But remember,

24:48.120 --> 24:51.822
if something goes wrong,
that package has to go off.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.692
That's the deal.
Victor's orders.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.027
A soldier doesn't leave
his post, right?

24:57.029 --> 24:58.028
Right.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.447
Don't let us down.

24:59.448 --> 25:00.865
We've got one shot at this.

25:00.867 --> 25:01.932
I know.

25:01.934 --> 25:05.202
See you at the Fox and Crown.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.620
I have my officers
searching the building.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.522
No sign of
your suspects.
CCTV?

25:24.524 --> 25:25.823
Limited only to
the common areas.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.308
Okay, thanks,
Sergeant.

25:27.309 --> 25:28.792
Let's clear
this area.
Right away.

25:28.794 --> 25:29.894
Spike, we're gonna
Command Post here.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.028
Copy.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.796
SAM:
This building has
15 floors.

25:32.798 --> 25:35.666
The Department of Immigration
takes up the first floor

25:35.668 --> 25:37.335
and the lower plaza.
If they're after civilians,

25:37.336 --> 25:39.003
then he's gonna be targeting
the open immigration areas.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.604
Wordy and I'll take Passports.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.307
Jules, Sam, take Immigration
and Appeals. Let's go.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.742
Remember, subjects
and backpacks.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.043
Danny, you're with us.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.924
(indistinct conversations)

26:27.653 --> 26:29.653
It's Jeff! He's on his way out!

26:31.157 --> 26:33.591
Visual on Jeff.
He's in the lobby.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.593
PARKER:
Stay back. Stay down.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.163
The trigger's
impact-sensitive.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.131
We can't let it drop.
Sleeper hold.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.766
What about the backpack?
I'll grab it.

26:42.768 --> 26:43.767
Your arm.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.102
I got it, Spike.

26:50.376 --> 26:53.811
(gasping)

26:56.983 --> 26:59.083
Did you get the bag?

26:59.085 --> 27:00.751
Sarge?

27:00.753 --> 27:02.186
Sergeant?!
Sergeant, cuff him.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.854
Get him out of here.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.755
Get everybody out of here!

27:04.757 --> 27:07.725
(handcuffs click)

27:07.727 --> 27:10.961
Get 'em out!
Get everybody out!

27:10.963 --> 27:12.363
That's you, too, boss.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.370
Copy that.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.363
Package disabled.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.965
One down.

28:10.723 --> 28:14.391
We have a visual on Trent.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.302
Trent?!

28:27.873 --> 28:29.440
I've got a bomb!

28:29.442 --> 28:31.909
(people screaming)

28:33.145 --> 28:34.912
Okay, everybody stay calm!

28:34.914 --> 28:37.981
The police are here!
Just move to the exit!

28:37.983 --> 28:38.982
Sam?

28:38.984 --> 28:40.317
I speak soldier. I got it.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.888
We got your back, Sam.

28:46.492 --> 28:49.359
Trent, my name is Sam Braddock.
Let's talk, okay?

28:49.361 --> 28:50.394
Don't come any closer!

28:50.396 --> 28:52.830
I'm backing up, all right?

28:52.832 --> 28:53.964
I'm backing away.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.000
All right, I'm backing away.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.404
Go, go, get out of here.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.174
That boy's scared.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.112
You're checking
the clock, Trent.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.947
Is there something
I should know about?

29:13.786 --> 29:14.952
Spike, do you have
Jeff's device?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.386
I'm looking right at it.
This bomb was

29:16.388 --> 29:18.122
set to go at 3:00 p.m.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.857
They're using frequency clocks,
synched up,

29:19.859 --> 29:21.892
so I'm guessing that's when
they're all set to go.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.094
Maybe 3:00's a symbolic time.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.963
Well, we got 12 minutes.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.798
What if I take down
the subject and he drops it?

29:27.800 --> 29:30.234
Then the impact overrides the
timer, and it blows sooner.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.435
Good to know.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.936
How about electronic
countermeasures?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.488
Yeah, maybe with an EMP.

29:34.489 --> 29:36.039
But there's no way I can get one
here in time.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.242
The only way to disable these
guys is up close,

29:38.244 --> 29:39.476
old-school pliers and cutters.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.912
Looks like we're
talking him down.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.787
Down to two bombs
and a 3:00 p.m. deadline.

29:49.789 --> 29:50.988
We need to find Victor.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.056
I don't know, I don't know.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.525
Does he carry a cell phone?

29:54.527 --> 29:57.995
Victor took my phone earlier.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.363
He might still have it.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.164
Type the number here.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.499
Okay.

30:05.337 --> 30:09.973
And we got a signal,
narrowing it down...

30:09.975 --> 30:11.875
Simcoe and Front.
Four blocks from here.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.510
All right,
notify all units in that area.

30:13.512 --> 30:14.978
We will not lose him.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.979
Wordy, Ed you copy that?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.048
That's the Sussex Arms.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.049
On our way.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.253
Look, Trent,
you're just following orders.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.421
I get that, okay?

30:24.423 --> 30:26.123
You delivered the bomb
to this location.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.825
You've done your job.

30:27.827 --> 30:30.227
My orders are to make sure
it goes off.
Then let's

30:30.229 --> 30:31.495
walk away and make that happen.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.330
You leave the bag there,
you've done your duty.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.099
You'll disable it.

30:36.101 --> 30:38.368
Trent, do you want to die?

30:38.370 --> 30:42.973
A soldier never leaves
his post.

30:44.910 --> 30:48.078
Okay, Trent, I think I know why
we're here;

30:48.080 --> 30:50.180
why you want to do this.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.615
Can I ask you
a question?

30:51.617 --> 30:54.852
Can you tell me about what
happened to your dad?

31:00.092 --> 31:02.893
Spike, we're approaching
the hotel.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.061
SPIKE:
Victor's signal's coming

31:04.063 --> 31:06.129
from the second floor
conference area.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.564
Copy that.

31:09.602 --> 31:12.169
Spike, we're here.
Can you narrow it down?

31:14.139 --> 31:15.272
Left of your location.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.207
It's gotta be through here.

31:17.209 --> 31:21.278
Police! Police! SRU!

31:21.280 --> 31:22.980
SRU! Police!
Stop!

31:22.982 --> 31:25.048
Right there!

31:25.050 --> 31:27.384
Hands in the air!

31:27.386 --> 31:29.620
And down on
your knees slowly.

31:29.622 --> 31:31.121
Don't move a muscle.

31:32.024 --> 31:35.158
(device beeping)

31:35.160 --> 31:36.710
Positive for explosives.

31:36.711 --> 31:38.261
Okay, not a muscle.
Not a muscle.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.433
Don't even breathe.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.503
There's nothing in here.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.275
Where's the bomb,
Victor?

31:51.277 --> 31:53.977
I don't know.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.146
Ask Kelly.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.059
What?
Victor may have

32:09.061 --> 32:10.661
given the bomb to Kelly.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.429
He-he doesn't-doesn't
even know her.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.097
He tracked her down at work,
at the hotel.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.132
How does he know her?

32:15.134 --> 32:15.999
Just stay calm.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.701
I gotta get out of here!

32:17.702 --> 32:19.402
I gotta go help her!
Danny, hey, hey,
calm down!

32:19.405 --> 32:22.372
My team will find her. My team
will keep her safe, okay?

32:22.374 --> 32:23.440
Trent's still at risk.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.441
We need you here.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.509
I can't.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.110
Remember what you said?

32:27.112 --> 32:29.046
"I will never desert you."

32:29.048 --> 32:31.148
Come on, buddy.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.383
We gotta make sure
he knows that, all right?

32:34.486 --> 32:35.619
Good man.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.653
Jules?

32:36.655 --> 32:38.221
We're making progress, boss.

32:39.425 --> 32:40.657
Sam's got an angle.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.226
Your dad apologized?

32:43.228 --> 32:45.963
"I'm so ashamed."

32:45.965 --> 32:48.165
That was the last thing
he said to me.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.767
He quit on us!

32:49.768 --> 32:51.368
He's not a fighter
like you, right?

32:53.105 --> 32:56.206
How did you convince Kelly
to take the bomb, Victor?

32:56.208 --> 32:58.041
I didn't convince Kelly
to take a bomb.

32:58.043 --> 33:00.177
She doesn't know
what she's carrying.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.211
What's her target?

33:01.213 --> 33:03.680
What's her target, Victor?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.716
Her target is the enemy.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.718
ED:
You're a real brave man.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.152
Sending other people to die.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.187
She was expendable.

33:10.189 --> 33:11.421
What, like Trent?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.457
Easy to send
kids, right?

33:13.459 --> 33:14.658
Where is she, Victor?

33:16.095 --> 33:18.128
Where is she?!

33:18.130 --> 33:20.630
See what blows at 3:00 p.m.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.600
Don't let him out
of your sight. Let's go.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.269
If it's antipersonnel,

33:26.271 --> 33:28.205
it's not about a
symbolic building
or property damage.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.473
It's about the
people-- the enemy.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.742
He said see what blows at 3:00.

33:31.744 --> 33:34.244
Danny, 3:00 p.m. today.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.246
If Victor's trying
to send a message,

33:36.248 --> 33:39.082
there's got to be a reason
for the time and the target.

33:39.084 --> 33:41.318
He-he said that today
was the beginning.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.719
It's about taking
our country back.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.187
It's Citizenship Day.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.589
Citizenship Day?

33:45.591 --> 33:50.027
Victor said... we're gonna
celebrate it our way.

33:51.196 --> 33:54.031
Citizenship ceremonies
held across the country.

33:54.033 --> 33:55.232
Here-- 85 new citizens
take the oath.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.100
Open to the public. 3:00 p.m.

33:57.102 --> 33:58.635
1587 Adelaide Street.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.504
Ed, kick it up. You're close.

34:00.506 --> 34:03.240
Sidney, send out uniforms
three-block radius.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.342
Soak the area-- 1587 Adelaide.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.210
Copy.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.646
Jules, you're running low
on time.

34:09.647 --> 34:12.081
We got to get that boy
out of there.
I'm watching, boss.

34:12.084 --> 34:14.251
Trent, your dad made his choice.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.686
No, they made him do it.
Who did?

34:16.688 --> 34:19.089
That scared little boy
that was here before?

34:19.091 --> 34:20.357
He did that to your dad?

34:20.359 --> 34:23.260
You know who
hasn't quit on you?

34:23.262 --> 34:24.361
Your brother.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.229
No, he and I are done.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.265
He made his choice.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.300
PARKER:
<i> How old was Trent</i>
<i> when he found your dad?</i>

34:30.302 --> 34:32.202
13.

34:32.204 --> 34:35.372
I came in the room,
Trent was already there.

34:35.374 --> 34:38.341
Dad was hanging.

34:38.343 --> 34:40.577
Trent was screaming.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.080
Not crying--

34:43.082 --> 34:44.748
screaming...

34:46.552 --> 34:49.252
<i> ...at Dad.</i>

34:49.254 --> 34:53.290
Angry. I had to pull him off.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.247
Hey, Sam,

35:00.248 --> 35:02.165
Trent was angry at his dad
for abandoning him.

35:02.167 --> 35:03.700
Then when Danny met Kelly,

35:03.702 --> 35:05.469
Trent thought he was leaving
him, too.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.771
So he's clinging to Victor,

35:07.773 --> 35:10.240
'cause that's all the family
he thinks he has left.

35:10.242 --> 35:13.376
Trent needs to know
he's not alone.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.312
I'm going to bring Danny down.
Let him see him.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.546
Let him know he's there.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.281
No, I got this, boss.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.616
We're on the edge here, Sam.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.252
If we can't get through,
you got to get out of there.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.321
Copy that.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.889
SPIKE:
Uniforms got a sighting

35:25.891 --> 35:28.425
south on York between
Richmond and Adelaide.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.196
Subjects in range.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.635
Kelly, don't move.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.838
We need to vacate this area
immediately, please!

35:41.840 --> 35:43.673
You, back over there!

35:43.675 --> 35:46.343
Everybody back! Clear this area!

35:46.345 --> 35:48.128
All the way back, please!

35:48.129 --> 35:49.912
I need you to stay very still...
Get back!

35:49.915 --> 35:52.649
Kelly, okay?
Very still.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.319
Less than two minutes, Sam.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.522
Trent, let me spell
this out for you.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.290
The mission is over.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.459
There's no enemy
personnel to take out.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.294
There's no
message to
the world.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.463
If that bomb goes off,
you'll be sacrificing yourself

36:06.465 --> 36:07.597
for nothing!

36:09.301 --> 36:10.600
ED:
Okay, Kelly,
we're going to come

36:10.602 --> 36:13.203
a little closer here.
I need that bag.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.205
Wha-what's going on?
I don't understand.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.373
It's okay.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.441
I'm going to take
you to see Danny

36:18.443 --> 36:21.478
as soon as I can, but first
I need to take that bag.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.213
You understand
what that means, right?

36:23.215 --> 36:24.481
PARKER:
Where you going?

36:24.483 --> 36:25.782
Trent, to die for nothing?

36:25.784 --> 36:26.816
Sam, get out of range.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.451
Trent!
Get out of here!

36:28.453 --> 36:30.687
Not without you.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.623
Your brother's been here
the whole time.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.625
Even with
Kelly in danger.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.294
What happened to Kelly?

36:37.296 --> 36:39.396
Stand back! Please,
for your security

36:39.398 --> 36:41.398
I need you to stand
all the way back!

36:41.400 --> 36:43.383
SAM:
<i> Your C.O. Victor--</i>

36:43.384 --> 36:45.367
he doesn't share the same sense
of duty you do.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.337
He gave her the bomb
to deliver.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.406
Sam, you're too close,
you're too close.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.208
Just like he gave it to you.
Too close, Sam.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.243
He's willing to sacrifice
your life for his cause,

36:53.245 --> 36:54.444
but not his own.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.749
JULES:
One minute left, guys.
Okay, okay.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.884
Everything's
under control here.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.385
You're safe.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.254
I'm going to tell you
the truth here, Kelly.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.390
There's an explosive
in that bag, so just
very calmly hand it to me.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.593
Thank you, Kelly.
What?!
Come with me, please.

37:09.595 --> 37:12.262
But Danny texted me.
I thought it was a present.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.863
SAM: He left you
to die, Trent.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.565
But your brother--
he's right here.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.435
He's not going anywhere.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.869
And he told me he made
you a promise.

37:19.871 --> 37:20.937
I'm staying right here.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.473
JULES:
40 seconds.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.874
Spike, talk to me.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.409
Ed, there's just one wire
you got to cut.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.477
It's really simple, man.

37:27.479 --> 37:30.547
Yellow with red,
cut by the battery.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.817
JULES:
30 seconds.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.485
Come on, come on...

37:35.487 --> 37:37.070
Boss, we got to fall back.

37:37.071 --> 37:38.654
Moving out, now, now.
All right, you're done, Sam.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.756
DANNY:
Trent!
We're out of time.

37:39.758 --> 37:40.991
DANNY:
I'm staying with you!

37:40.993 --> 37:42.392
Come on, Sam!
Sam, you got to get out...

37:42.394 --> 37:43.593
DANNY:
Trent!

37:43.595 --> 37:44.828
JULES: Sam, you did
everything you could.

37:44.830 --> 37:45.829
You pull back now!

37:45.831 --> 37:47.330
Now, Sam!

37:49.301 --> 37:50.634
Ten seconds.
JULES:
Sam...

37:50.636 --> 37:52.569
Your brother needs you, too.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.671
Sam!
Seven!

37:54.673 --> 37:56.673
Come on, Trent.
Six!
Sam!

37:56.675 --> 37:58.341
Five! Four!
Now, let's go, come on.

37:58.343 --> 38:00.644
SPIKE:
Three...

38:00.646 --> 38:02.012
two...

38:54.633 --> 38:58.935
¶ ¶

39:01.473 --> 39:06.676
¶ If I lost the fight ¶

39:08.013 --> 39:14.417
¶ Would you take me inside? ¶

39:14.419 --> 39:20.623
¶ Would you hold on through? ¶

39:20.625 --> 39:28.832
¶ Make it all feel like new? ¶

39:30.535 --> 39:36.673
¶ Will you be there for me? ¶

39:36.675 --> 39:42.946
¶ Will you be there? ¶

39:42.948 --> 39:47.016
¶ Will you hold on tight? ¶

39:47.018 --> 39:51.988
¶ Will you make it all right? ¶

39:51.990 --> 39:59.562
¶ Will you be there for me? ¶

40:05.537 --> 40:07.570
What is this? Go home.

40:07.572 --> 40:08.605
We wanted to see the stitches.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.774
Make sure you went
to the hospital.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.943
Well, I appreciate the concern,
but I'm gonna keep my shirt on.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.645
Look, we're all going to go
grab a drink

40:15.647 --> 40:16.946
at the Goose. You coming?

40:16.948 --> 40:18.782
Aw, I got...

40:20.118 --> 40:22.452
Yeah, sure.

40:22.454 --> 40:24.454
Of course you are,
'cause you're buying.
What?!

40:24.456 --> 40:26.656
Rules, boss. You get shot,
you buy the first round.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.425
Yeah, Wordy should know.

40:28.427 --> 40:29.826
(all laughing)

40:29.828 --> 40:30.894
STEVE:
Hey, uh, Julianna.

40:30.896 --> 40:31.895
Oh, hey.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.430
Hey.

40:33.432 --> 40:34.798
Hi. Ha!

40:35.967 --> 40:37.901
Ah... (clearing throat)

40:37.903 --> 40:40.437
Uh, Steve, I want you
to meet the guys.

40:40.439 --> 40:44.741
Um, Sam and Wordy,
and Sarge, Spike and Ed.

40:44.743 --> 40:47.177
How you doing?
PARKER:
We met, yeah.

40:47.179 --> 40:49.612
We went to high school
together back in The Hat.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.481
Jewel of the Prairies.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.818
Hmm.

40:54.820 --> 40:58.455
So, anyway, we talked
about catching up...

40:58.457 --> 41:00.723
Yeah, um...

41:00.725 --> 41:03.660
You know what, we were... we
were going to go to the Goose,

41:03.662 --> 41:05.161
'cause it was
a really big day.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.729
Okay.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.531
You want to come with us?

41:08.533 --> 41:11.534
No. That's okay.
You guys go. Thanks.

41:11.536 --> 41:14.537
We'll do next time.

41:14.539 --> 41:17.607
Next time. Okay.

41:17.609 --> 41:25.081

me to take it with you... ¶
