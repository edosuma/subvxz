WEBVTT

01:43.729 --> 01:45.022
Pity. Pity, get up.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.231
Come on now, sleepyhead.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.942
Come on now, boy. We ain't got all night.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.237
Coydog?

01:52.321 --> 01:54.698
Of course it's me. Now be quiet. Let's go.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.283
What you doin' here?

01:56.366 --> 01:59.244
- Gettin' you. That's what I'm doin' here.
- No. No, no, no.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.997
My mind ain't supposed to be
back here no more. I'm cured.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.082
You stop talkin' that foolishness
and let's go.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.209
No, Coydog.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.419
My mind ain't like this no more.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.588
I took the devil's poison,

02:09.670 --> 02:13.258
and now I remember the past
instead of it remembering me.

02:13.967 --> 02:14.968
So you remember it all?

02:15.052 --> 02:16.136
Yeah.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.180
Then what was it I tasked you to do?

02:21.975 --> 02:22.976
Come on.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.338
Why won't you just tell me what it is
I don't recollect?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.882
Well, don't you think I would if I could?

02:53.966 --> 02:55.425
Why can't you?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.594
'Cause this ain't my dream.

03:14.820 --> 03:15.821
Here we is.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.073
That's Delia's Cathouse.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.201
Why we had to go the long way around
to get here?

03:21.285 --> 03:24.705
We went the long way around
to come up on the back so nobody see us.

03:25.747 --> 03:26.915
Why we hidin'?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.251
What's up there by Delia's?

03:30.919 --> 03:32.880
- The old iron trough?
- Show me.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.513
Here it is, Coydog. Here it is.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.639
Shut up, boy.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.641
We don't want nobody to hear us.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.105
You remember where the pig head at?

03:50.189 --> 03:51.648
On this end, over here.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.321
And which way Mr. Pig lookin'?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.406
Southeast.

03:59.907 --> 04:00.991
Let's go.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.911
This way.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.086
You know what this is?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.923
Yeah. It's the old, stone dry well
the slaves used to make.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.845
You know Clive Miller?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.473
He that mean, old white man.

04:24.556 --> 04:28.435
His kinfolk owned slaves back in the day
and did terrible things to 'em.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.775
And after the emancipation,
he run that sharecropping business.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.196
A nigga work for him be in debt
the rest of his natural-born life.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.908
Got mad at my daddy one time.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.702
We never seen my daddy again.

04:46.870 --> 04:50.374
His family been squeezing the blood
out of Black folks for hundreds of years.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.418
Since before the revolution.

04:53.502 --> 04:57.297
They made all men equal,
except for if they had Black skin.

04:58.423 --> 05:03.345
They took all the freedom, love and hope
out of every Black soul they touched,

05:03.428 --> 05:09.560
and they made it all into a black heart
that Clive Miller keep to hisself.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.145
It's really a heart?

05:13.438 --> 05:14.815
Well, that's what I calls it.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.568
It's treasure, Pity.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.947
It's treasure made off the suffering
of Black folks.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.532
And Clive Miller gloated on it.

05:23.615 --> 05:27.411
He gloated 'cause the only thing make him
feel good is the pain he put on us.

05:30.706 --> 05:34.168
One night last year, when he was drunk
on some moonshine I sold to him,

05:34.251 --> 05:36.086
he told me about his treasure.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.171
So last night,

05:38.755 --> 05:40.799
I sold him some corn liquor.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.303
And when he wasn't looking,
I poured some laudanum in it.

05:45.387 --> 05:49.057
And when he passed out, I searched
his house till I found that treasure,

05:49.141 --> 05:51.393
that black heart he holdin' on to.

05:52.728 --> 05:55.230
And I did all that for you.

05:56.982 --> 05:57.983
For me?

06:00.819 --> 06:04.364
See, Clive gonna know I took his treasure,
so I gotta run.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.200
And, Pity…

06:08.368 --> 06:11.121
it's you who gonna have to take
what I stole

06:11.205 --> 06:13.123
and use it to help our people.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.960
Is it down in this well right here?

06:29.848 --> 06:33.685
At the bottom of this here well,
there's one reddish cobblestone.

06:34.645 --> 06:39.107
Now, I hid the black heart behind
the stone two rocks above the red one.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.192
You understand?

06:41.193 --> 06:45.030
Yeah, but you gonna go away forever
right now?

06:45.531 --> 06:47.574
Right after I go by my place.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.660
Can I come wit' you?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.787
No, little brother.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.664
Could be dangerous.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.000
But you said Mr. Miller was drunk asleep.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.087
Yeah.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.590
I gave him a full dram of laudanum.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.635
So I'm coming?

07:11.306 --> 07:12.516
Let's go.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.279
Nobody there.

07:26.864 --> 07:27.990
Maybe not.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.201
Then why you going if you so scared?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.830
Well, my mama's Bible down there.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.583
That's all I got left of her.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.336
I could go get it for you.
He ain't looking for me.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.297
No, no. You just a child.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.550
And I done already put enough
on your shoulders.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.303
No.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.894
That's my Bible down there.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.938
And I'ma go get it.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.705
Get him!

08:59.540 --> 09:02.167
- I got him.
- Well, look who it is.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.921
- Not so strong now, huh?
- Easy now.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.048
We need to talk to him first.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.468
- Please, help. Help. Who would help?
- There you go.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.346
Settle him down! Get his arms.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.769
Boy gained some weight.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.605
Come on, get him over there.
Get that barrel.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.819
- No, please, no. No.
- Uncle.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.070
Uncle.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.405
Uncle, wake up.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.201
Where am I?

09:36.827 --> 09:37.953
You're in your bed.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.247
Well, how--

09:41.290 --> 09:42.749
How long I been asleep?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.710
Couple days.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.253
- Couple d--
- You been--

09:46.837 --> 09:48.505
You been in and out. Mostly out.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.259
How you feel now?

09:53.177 --> 09:54.469
Like I was dead

09:55.429 --> 09:58.765
and been drug across hot coals
back to life.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.351
Yeah.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.645
You were screaming
and yelling in your dreams.

10:03.729 --> 10:06.315
Didn't feel like no dream. Felt real.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.612
Coydog always after me
about what I ain't doin'.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.780
And I ain't understand.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.825
I'm starting to get it now.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.245
It's about the black heart.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.664
What's-- What's a black heart?

10:23.624 --> 10:25.667
This treasure Coydog stole.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.713
He told me what I need to do with it.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.507
He even told me where it was.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.343
But now I…

10:35.677 --> 10:38.764
I don't know what I did with it
or where it's at.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.059
Here, just take some water.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.021
I called the doctor.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.856
Just now?

10:48.524 --> 10:51.818
When your fever spiked
and then again when you started screamin'.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.948
What'd he have to say?

10:56.532 --> 10:59.535
The nurse said
to rub you down with alcohol.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.871
Doctor said to bring you in
when you wake up,

11:02.955 --> 11:04.206
which is some bullshit.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.415
Easy now.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.377
No. You know,
you don't get to say that to me.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.923
You scared the shit out of me.
I didn't know if you was gonna wake up.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.595
If I'd known this was gonna happen,
I would've never let you do it.

11:18.679 --> 11:22.099
I'm the one said yes, not you.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.562
I guess I'll make the call.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.440
Get your own self dressed.

12:02.431 --> 12:05.934
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

12:06.018 --> 12:08.437
Men have named you

12:09.229 --> 12:15.444
Is it just because
Your sad and mystic smile

12:16.695 --> 12:21.158
Is it only 'cause you're lonely

12:21.241 --> 12:23.577
Men have blamed you

12:27.789 --> 12:32.669
Is in your eyes

13:29.768 --> 13:31.019
Where you find that suit?

13:31.103 --> 13:33.355
- You like?
- Yeah.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.276
Clean-shaven, too. Not too bad, Pitypapa.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.528
Yeah, it don't fit like it used to.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.738
I done shrunk a little bit, but--

13:43.615 --> 13:45.701
Damn. Smells good in here.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.703
The gas was just turned off on the stove.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.663
I got down there and turned it on again.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.623
You better than having a handyman.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.880
I feel like I ain't et
in a month of Sundays.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.382
My daddy used to say that.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.177
Where is your daddy?

14:03.260 --> 14:04.553
Dead.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.805
- Your mama?
- Her too.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.893
You told me that before, didn't you?

14:13.228 --> 14:16.231
I seen my first dead body
when I was six years old.

14:16.315 --> 14:20.527
My little girlfriend, Maude Petit,
burnt up in a tar paper shack.

14:20.611 --> 14:23.739
My mama had to hold me back to keep me
from runnin' in there and save her.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.699
You remember that now?

14:26.825 --> 14:31.163
Yeah, but I don't remember
like I remember remembering.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.623
And not everything.

14:33.207 --> 14:37.920
It's like the things I can't recollect
is behind this closed door.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.965
And I can hear my memories,
but I can't see 'em or touch 'em.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.884
You know like Coydog's treasure

14:45.302 --> 14:46.637
and Reggie.

14:46.720 --> 14:52.309
I know he told me some things,
but I can't quite hear 'em right.

14:52.392 --> 14:57.189
So, I think when I do,
I'll be able to figure some stuff out.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.149
Like what?

15:00.108 --> 15:03.320
Like, you know, why he got killed

15:03.403 --> 15:05.280
and maybe even who killed him.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.751
Car will be here in 20 minutes.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.128
Be ready.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.882
What the hell just happened?

15:30.347 --> 15:31.640
There ain't no fish in here.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.058
Mr. Grey.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.562
You look very sharp. How you feeling?

15:36.645 --> 15:40.023
- Never better. And that's fact.
- Good. Good.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.191
Miss Barnet.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.280
How's your memory?

15:46.363 --> 15:49.950
I'm still a little foggy,
but I know what time it is.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.786
And I'm stronger.
Lot more stable on my feet.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.454
Well, that's very good news.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.499
Less than 10% of our patients experience
a physical improvement.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.877
Well, that make me
one of the lucky ones, don't it?

15:59.960 --> 16:02.045
Yes, yes. Please, this way.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.630
Come on.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.383
What's the matter?

16:09.261 --> 16:12.264
So you just gonna sit there
nodding your heads, smiling,

16:12.347 --> 16:16.268
like he wasn't burning with fever
and sweating like a pig, crying for help?

16:16.351 --> 16:18.562
Look, his intense response
to the first shot did--

16:18.645 --> 16:19.646
It took us by surprise.

16:19.730 --> 16:22.566
But that--
That is just the nature of this beast.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.359
It was still messed up.
He could have died.

16:24.443 --> 16:27.029
I assure you that
Mr. Grey's life was never in danger.

16:27.112 --> 16:30.490
- Yeah, why should we believe that?
- Look, these are merely side effects.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.743
Night terrors, delirium,
they're not uncommon,

16:32.826 --> 16:34.536
and they will abate in a few days.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.246
So what about his fevers?

16:36.330 --> 16:41.043
His fever will return from time to time.
Mostly at night.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.045
It'll need to be monitored and managed.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.214
The fever I can handle.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.300
What gets me is
what's going on in my mind.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.845
It's a whole lifetime
just spinning around in there,

16:51.929 --> 16:53.305
but not everything.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.099
Especially not the time
when I was afflicted.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.727
And you said I would remember it all.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.896
Well, we're only halfway there, Mr. Grey.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.524
You'll need the last injection
before all blockages are cleared.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.108
That's when all of it comes back?

17:05.192 --> 17:07.319
Yes, more than you can ever imagine.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.363
So then he'll be, like, safe and sound?

17:09.445 --> 17:10.948
For the duration of the trial, yes.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.491
- Absolutely.
- Wait. Back up.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.117
For the duration?
I thought you said this was a cure.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.165
Thanks to people like Mr. Grey,

17:20.249 --> 17:23.627
we will ultimately move the human race,
the entire species, forward.

17:24.169 --> 17:27.297
Millions of people that suffer
from his disease will have a cure.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.801
What about him? What's gonna happen
to him after your "duration"?

17:30.884 --> 17:33.679
On average,
peak effect lasts around four weeks.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.515
- Four weeks.
- Sometimes six. Maybe seven.

17:36.598 --> 17:40.227
And that's when the party's over,
and I go back to normal?

17:42.020 --> 17:44.857
Actually, we have found,
depending on the intensity of treatment,

17:44.940 --> 17:47.776
in some cases it can…

17:47.860 --> 17:51.280
accelerate the cognitive deterioration
that was already taking place.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.116
Meaning my mind's gonna be worse
than it was before?

17:54.199 --> 17:56.034
Out of the 157 trials we've logged,

17:56.118 --> 17:57.744
not one patient has reacted the same.

17:58.579 --> 18:01.540
And no one as strong as you
has ever been tested.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.542
That ain't exactly a ringing endorsement.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.004
- What if we walk out this bitch right now?
- I wouldn't advise it.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.006
That's a pretty valid question though.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.092
What if I was to leave out here right now?

18:12.176 --> 18:13.510
If you did that,

18:13.594 --> 18:17.514
you would experience some mental and
physical reckoning not unlike withdrawal.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.142
And at your age,
that would not be a pretty road.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.186
I sat with my mama
through withdrawal twice.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.480
- I could get him through it. Come on.
- If you do that, his mind will still fade.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.275
- He gonna be back to normal. Come on.
- If you can call it that.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.359
Bird.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.528
Fuck that. You don't need them.
You don't need any of this.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.071
Bird. Bird. Listen.

18:33.822 --> 18:37.367
I know your heart is in the right place.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.580
But I got to finish this.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.683
She means well.

19:03.769 --> 19:08.106
But you… have lied.

19:11.735 --> 19:15.822
Mr. Grey,
I would do anything to achieve a cure.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.076
But I think that you already knew that.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.792
So…

19:28.919 --> 19:31.046
You got something I need to sign?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.484
Can I get you anything?

19:53.652 --> 19:55.362
No, thank you, ma'am.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.501
Here, baby.

20:09.585 --> 20:10.919
Let me get that for you.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.801
Looking good.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.094
Bless you.

20:21.847 --> 20:22.931
How much I owe?

20:27.603 --> 20:28.979
Don't you worry about that.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.658
All right. It's okay.

20:45.871 --> 20:48.832
- Would you like me to read it to you?
- I can read, Satan.

20:53.212 --> 20:56.381
Says here you want ownership of my body.

20:56.465 --> 20:58.217
That's the basic agreement, yes.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.635
But not my soul.

20:59.718 --> 21:02.679
- I have no use for a soul, Mr. Grey.
- Good.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.389
'Cause I'm gonna need mine.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.811
How come it don't bother you
when I call you Satan?

21:12.231 --> 21:14.858
There's a lot of money
behind this research.

21:15.359 --> 21:19.780
Individual trusts, big pharma,
plenty of wealth and privilege.

21:20.906 --> 21:23.659
I assume that you're just calling it
like you see it.

21:25.994 --> 21:29.331
Also says here
I get $5,000 just for signing.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.708
Yes, I could probably bump that up.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.127
No, no, no, Beezel, no.

21:34.837 --> 21:38.340
I'm sure your money bought plenty
of Black souls and bodies.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.092
But I ain't selling.

21:41.051 --> 21:44.513
Me and you, we just trading favors.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.849
And I need this here contract to say that.

21:47.516 --> 21:49.852
- If it makes you feel better.
- And that ain't all.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.981
Now you say
when I get this here next shot,

21:54.731 --> 21:57.484
that's gonna bring all my memories back?

21:57.568 --> 21:58.902
Yes.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.612
Well, that's when I sign.

22:01.196 --> 22:05.200
Mr. Grey, I'm sorry,
but it doesn't work like that.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.537
I need a signed release
before I give you the last dose.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.621
Listen here.

22:10.706 --> 22:13.333
I got a lot of things to do,

22:13.417 --> 22:15.878
and I need my memory to do it.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.087
All of it.

22:18.422 --> 22:19.506
Give me that…

22:21.508 --> 22:23.677
this body is yours.

22:34.771 --> 22:35.898
I won't make it today.

22:35.981 --> 22:39.109
I woke up feeling pretty tore down,
so I'll catch you ladies next time.

22:43.614 --> 22:45.991
Miss Barnet, Mr. Grey needs you.

22:49.036 --> 22:53.248
What you doing? Get off. Okay. Let me go.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.966
No! No, stop it. Leave me alone! Get--

23:03.050 --> 23:05.177
- Help! Help!
- Please. Calm down, calm down.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.638
Get the fuck off of me.

23:07.721 --> 23:09.389
Can you get the fuck off of me?

23:11.308 --> 23:12.518
Goddamn.

23:22.861 --> 23:23.862
What is it?

23:24.863 --> 23:26.907
Stay with me through this?

23:38.961 --> 23:41.588
Mr. Grey,
I'm gonna lean you back now, okay?

23:42.548 --> 23:43.882
Here we go.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.137
Okay.

23:53.809 --> 23:56.019
Here we go. All right.

23:56.645 --> 23:58.105
Tell me something, Satan.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.190
Yeah, what's that?

24:02.150 --> 24:03.652
You enjoy your work?

24:08.615 --> 24:10.033
Brace yourself, Mr. Grey.

25:13.889 --> 25:17.017
Think I'm gonna sit out here for a while
in the sun.

25:20.354 --> 25:22.022
You welcome to join me if you want.

25:33.283 --> 25:36.620
Yeah, and that's all right
because she's used to waiting.

25:36.703 --> 25:37.829
What you doing?

25:37.913 --> 25:39.289
I'm about to text Billy.

25:39.373 --> 25:40.374
For what?

25:41.500 --> 25:43.710
I got to go to Niecie's house
to get the rest of my stuff.

25:47.089 --> 25:48.131
You still mad, huh?

25:50.717 --> 25:52.344
You think I made a mistake.

25:54.555 --> 25:56.098
What you care about what I think?

25:57.182 --> 26:00.727
What you think is very important to me.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.149
Them people don't give a shit about you.

26:07.192 --> 26:08.193
Yeah, I know.

26:09.111 --> 26:10.696
Then why you ain't listen to me?

26:11.822 --> 26:15.242
I could've got you out of there. Why you
let them people fuck with you like that?

26:17.536 --> 26:20.664
You remember when you first met me
at the repast?

26:21.874 --> 26:23.166
What'd I smell like?

26:26.044 --> 26:29.548
What if you had told me
to go in Niecie's room,

26:29.631 --> 26:34.636
look in the top drawer of her bureau
and bring you the red socks?

26:34.720 --> 26:37.306
You think
I would have remembered any of that?

26:37.389 --> 26:41.602
No, but somebody could give you a bath,
and I could get them socks for myself, so…

26:41.685 --> 26:43.270
Yeah, that's right.

26:44.313 --> 26:47.941
Yeah, Reggie took care of me.
Now you doing it.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.028
So let's flip this.

26:52.988 --> 26:53.989
Flip what?

26:55.240 --> 26:58.702
What if it's you
who smelled like body waste?

26:59.453 --> 27:03.832
You who can't remember
from one word to the next.

27:03.916 --> 27:08.670
You who got the mind of a child
in a grown woman's body.

27:09.421 --> 27:10.839
What would you do?

27:10.923 --> 27:12.591
And don't say you'd jump out a window,

27:12.674 --> 27:15.761
'cause you can't even remember
how to open the damn thing up.

27:18.096 --> 27:21.350
And that's how this thing is.

27:22.142 --> 27:26.647
You don't know whether to hate
your condition or to hate yourself.

27:30.317 --> 27:31.443
You felt all that?

27:33.111 --> 27:35.614
Yeah. All the time.

27:42.621 --> 27:44.414
- Here come that woman again.
- Huh?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.253
That's W-R-I-N-G.

27:52.172 --> 27:55.634
I can't believe this the second time you
come over trying to give me this money.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.595
The first time you were asleep,
so I had to come back.

27:58.679 --> 28:01.890
Well, you know, sun go down,
my eyes get heavy. I was in the bed.

28:01.974 --> 28:03.475
I'm a country boy.

28:03.559 --> 28:05.435
I'm used to goin' to bed
when the sun go down.

28:05.519 --> 28:07.271
When the sun rise, I get up and get at it.

28:07.354 --> 28:08.730
You sound like my father.

28:08.814 --> 28:11.775
He said, "Early to bed, early to rise.
You can get more done during the day."

28:11.859 --> 28:13.402
That's right. Sure enough is.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.195
And you honest 'cause I be--

28:15.279 --> 28:17.614
Tell the truth, I ain't even remember
loaning you this money.

28:17.698 --> 28:19.283
Well, I gave you my word.

28:19.366 --> 28:20.993
You see this money here?

28:21.076 --> 28:23.871
I didn't even know
I had loaned her this money,

28:23.954 --> 28:26.915
but Shirley went out of her way
to pay me back. Ain't that somethin'?

28:27.624 --> 28:28.959
Real nice, Miss Wring.

28:29.042 --> 28:31.670
Just trying to return Mr. Grey's kindness.

28:31.753 --> 28:35.507
And you had this pretty ring at the bank.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.843
I remember that. It was a treasure.

28:37.926 --> 28:40.470
My father gave it to my mother
60 years ago.

28:41.138 --> 28:42.181
You got it with you?

28:42.931 --> 28:44.183
Uh-huh.

28:44.266 --> 28:46.768
I know I shouldn't carry it around, but…

28:48.979 --> 28:51.106
Ever since I remembered that ring,

28:51.815 --> 28:54.318
I said, "I hope I run into her again,"

28:54.401 --> 28:57.112
'cause I found this in my pockets.

29:03.368 --> 29:05.370
Robyn, come here.

29:05.454 --> 29:06.788
All right. I'm coming.

29:06.872 --> 29:08.707
- Look at this.
- I'm coming.

29:10.626 --> 29:12.085
See this here?

29:12.669 --> 29:16.757
This is craftsmanship.
This here's a work of art.

29:17.257 --> 29:19.134
Wow. It's really beautiful.

29:20.344 --> 29:23.514
A beautiful ring for a beautiful woman.

29:26.934 --> 29:29.811
- Well, I got to go shopping, so…
- Here. Take this.

29:29.895 --> 29:31.146
Okay.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.314
And here.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.818
It was a pleasure meeting you, Miss Wring.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.074
- Nice girl, your niece.
- No, no, no.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.826
That's my great-niece's
best friend's child.

29:45.911 --> 29:47.079
Her folks is dead.

29:47.162 --> 29:50.457
And she come to stay with me
till she get herself together.

29:50.541 --> 29:53.001
Ptolemy Grey to the rescue again.

29:53.085 --> 29:56.547
No, no, no. If anything, she's saving me.

29:56.630 --> 29:59.091
I don't know
what I'd do without that girl.

29:59.716 --> 30:02.845
You seem different than you were
that day at the bank.

30:02.928 --> 30:06.265
Yeah, new medication.
I'm firing on all cylinders now.

30:06.348 --> 30:09.226
I hope I didn't embarrass
myself when I met you at the bank.

30:09.309 --> 30:12.062
You? I'm the one should apologize.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.773
Asking a stranger for money?

30:16.108 --> 30:18.360
Lucky I met someone as kind as you.

30:18.443 --> 30:21.572
No, no, no, no.
I ain't as nice as you think.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.031
You need to stop.

30:23.115 --> 30:25.117
If you-- I ain't saying I'm bad.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.370
It's just that, you know,
I never stood up to be counted.

30:28.453 --> 30:33.292
I always kinda blended in with the crowd
and went along with the program.

30:35.127 --> 30:36.795
You stood up for me.

30:51.143 --> 30:52.728
Hey. Hey, girl.

30:52.811 --> 30:54.021
What you want?

30:54.104 --> 30:55.314
Your name's Robyn, right?

30:56.023 --> 30:58.650
If you knew my name was Robyn,
why you calling me "girl"?

30:58.734 --> 31:00.360
I'm Roger. Roger Dawes.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.821
I work at Reggie's sometimes
when he does carpentry work.

31:02.905 --> 31:04.781
Helped with his aunt Niecie's
kitchen cabinets.

31:04.865 --> 31:05.866
Yeah, okay.

31:05.949 --> 31:09.328
Hey, you used to live down in Bankhead
'fore staying with Niecie, right?

31:10.120 --> 31:11.205
Uh-huh.

31:11.288 --> 31:13.624
Yeah, I haven't seen my man Reggie
since that job.

31:13.707 --> 31:15.292
What's he up to these days?

31:15.375 --> 31:18.879
- Dead.
- I'm sorry?

31:18.962 --> 31:21.048
Reggie died. Somebody shot him.

31:23.217 --> 31:26.845
What-- Da-- What happened?

31:26.929 --> 31:28.680
Just told you he got shot.

31:29.681 --> 31:32.351
Damn. Dead?

31:34.561 --> 31:35.729
I gotta go.

31:36.563 --> 31:38.023
Well, how's his uncle doing?

31:38.106 --> 31:39.983
The one whose name starts
with the silent P?

31:40.067 --> 31:42.402
- Why?
- I know him and Reggie was close.

31:42.945 --> 31:44.238
Reggie was looking after him.

31:44.821 --> 31:45.822
Well, I do that now.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.325
I met him a few times.

31:48.408 --> 31:51.328
Told some really good stories
about back down in Mississippi.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.829
That's where all my people's from.

31:54.039 --> 31:56.792
I'd like to drop by. Offer my sympathies.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.211
Yeah, well,
Mr. Grey ain't really in a place

31:59.294 --> 32:01.713
for folks to be coming by
without him knowing first.

32:02.256 --> 32:03.257
I understand.

32:06.218 --> 32:08.554
I can give you a ride. Car's right there.

32:11.932 --> 32:14.434
- It's just a couple blocks.
- I could walk with you.

32:16.395 --> 32:17.521
Let me get your bags.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.986
We can walk if you wanna walk.

32:26.822 --> 32:28.699
- How you doing?
- Fine.

32:29.658 --> 32:33.537
I mean, if I had to choose a song
to send to space in the Golden Record,

32:33.620 --> 32:34.746
it would be Stevie Wonder.

32:34.830 --> 32:36.874
To be clear, '70s Stevie Wonder.

32:36.957 --> 32:39.251
Not the "I Just Called
to Say I Love You" stuff.

32:40.085 --> 32:42.421
What? You don't like Stevie Wonder?

32:42.504 --> 32:47.050
No. It's just--
Did you just mention the Golden Record?

32:47.134 --> 32:48.135
Yeah.

32:48.886 --> 32:52.472
Just not something
that typically comes up in conversation.

32:52.556 --> 32:54.349
With the people I talk to, anyway.

32:55.392 --> 32:58.020
Well, I saw the spaceman on your boot.

32:59.646 --> 33:02.608
Well, it's a Martian, actually.

33:02.691 --> 33:03.692
So…

33:03.775 --> 33:05.360
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:06.862 --> 33:10.032
Don't forget to call me for a good time
I can come by and see Mr. Grey.

33:10.824 --> 33:11.825
I won't.

33:12.492 --> 33:13.785
- Okay, then.
- Okay, then.

33:20.751 --> 33:22.669
Go on. I'll call you.

33:23.462 --> 33:24.963
- Okay.
- For Mr. Grey.

33:25.047 --> 33:26.256
For Mr. Grey. All right.

33:35.807 --> 33:36.808
Go on!

33:39.436 --> 33:40.646
I'd better be going.

33:40.729 --> 33:42.773
Already? You just got here.

33:42.856 --> 33:45.526
My friend Alta's home from the hospital.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.110
I just want to check in on her.

33:48.904 --> 33:50.572
Shirley Wring to the rescue.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.953
I'ma call you in a couple of days.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.246
I hope so.

34:00.499 --> 34:02.000
You going already, Miss Wring?

34:02.084 --> 34:03.669
Yeah, she running out on me.

34:03.752 --> 34:06.255
No, I'm not.
I just want to check in on a friend.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.591
Well, I hope to see you again soon.

34:09.675 --> 34:10.717
I hope so.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.594
- If your uncle wants me to.
- Quit.

34:15.597 --> 34:16.639
Bye.

34:22.980 --> 34:26.315
Billy's gonna help me get the rest
of my stuff from Aunt Niecie's house.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.402
I won't be too long.
You need anything before I go?

34:28.485 --> 34:30.862
Uh-uh, go ahead.
I'll take care of all this here.

34:30.946 --> 34:35.199
I'm gonna heat up my coffee,
think about Shirley Wring.

34:36.952 --> 34:39.663
Well, don't strain yourself.

34:39.746 --> 34:41.206
Get on out of here, dirty girl.

35:21.997 --> 35:24.333
Let's get down to business.

35:24.416 --> 35:25.626
Boy, he's feisty.

35:26.877 --> 35:29.087
Behave now, boy.

35:30.088 --> 35:33.675
Coy, don't leave me. Come on.

35:36.595 --> 35:38.639
Look like he don't wanna talk.

35:59.952 --> 36:02.329
Man, what you got in here, little sister?

36:02.412 --> 36:05.624
Just the stuff I was able to grab
before they evicted me from my mama house.

36:06.291 --> 36:07.668
Got behind on your rent, huh?

36:07.751 --> 36:10.671
Yeah, I couldn't even pay for her funeral.
That's the one that fucked me up

36:10.754 --> 36:11.922
'cause the city had to do it,

36:12.005 --> 36:13.799
- and I don't want nothing from the city.
- Hey!

36:14.842 --> 36:16.552
- Here we go.
- What is y'all doing?

36:17.261 --> 36:19.721
Look, I knocked on the door,
but you ain't answer.

36:19.805 --> 36:22.391
So I used my key
to get the rest of my stuff.

36:22.474 --> 36:24.142
Hey, best step back, man.

36:24.226 --> 36:25.894
This is my house
you're taking that out of.

36:25.978 --> 36:27.980
But I ain't stealing nothing from you.
It's mine.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.147
Yeah, well, I'ma go check.

36:29.231 --> 36:31.859
And if anything come up missing,
don't think I ain't gonna find you.

36:31.942 --> 36:34.152
You ain't gotta find me.
I'm staying at Uncle Grey house.

36:34.236 --> 36:35.445
What you gonna do about it?

36:35.529 --> 36:37.281
- You his keeper now?
- Yep.

36:38.073 --> 36:39.867
Bitch, that ain't even your real uncle.

36:39.950 --> 36:43.203
- Hey, what you saying, man?
- Leave him alone. He ain't even worth it.

36:43.871 --> 36:45.205
He only about this big.

36:46.582 --> 36:47.583
Wussy.

36:50.085 --> 36:53.172
It ain't even fair, Billy.
You gonna crush him like a bug.

36:53.255 --> 36:54.506
Stay away from the crib!

36:54.590 --> 36:56.383
He gonna get them brains knocked
out his head.

36:56.466 --> 36:57.926
He better watch it.

37:03.974 --> 37:05.601
Come on. He ain't worth it.

37:05.684 --> 37:06.727
Hi.

37:06.810 --> 37:08.687
- What's up, Mr. Grey?
- Hey.

37:08.770 --> 37:09.855
What you doing?

37:09.938 --> 37:14.693
Trying to see how many folk I remember
from when I was a boy down in Mississippi.

37:14.776 --> 37:16.653
I'm up to 227.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.071
You knew a lot of people, huh?

37:18.155 --> 37:20.282
Most of these are my kinfolk.

37:20.365 --> 37:23.327
I figure I can probably fill out
about six more of these.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.579
What it feel like
remembering all that after so long?

37:26.580 --> 37:28.874
Like I'm standing
on the tallest mountain in the world

37:28.957 --> 37:32.294
and laying down in my grave
at the same time.

37:32.377 --> 37:35.464
Well, would you like to come on back
down to Earth and go with us?

37:36.006 --> 37:38.509
- Where to?
- To the diner to thank Billy.

37:39.801 --> 37:41.220
You buying him lunch.

37:41.803 --> 37:42.930
Lucky me.

37:47.392 --> 37:51.563
I remember Uncle Thorne told a joke,
grabbed his chest, keeled over.

37:51.647 --> 37:53.148
Dead as a doornail.

37:54.066 --> 37:58.403
I remember, my mama wore a white dress
she dyed black to the funeral.

37:58.904 --> 38:00.405
What's this medicine called, man?

38:01.114 --> 38:04.034
I mean, I have an auntie can't remember
her husband's face.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.787
Well, it ain't got no name or nothing yet.

38:06.870 --> 38:09.748
But I'll tell you, it is the devil's brew,

38:09.831 --> 38:12.876
and you got to be willing
to sell your soul if you take it.

38:13.669 --> 38:15.462
Remember, the devil come knocking,

38:15.546 --> 38:17.840
you better answer,
or he'll burn your house down.

38:18.882 --> 38:20.008
You deep, uncle.

38:20.759 --> 38:22.594
Where'd you all find this devil doctor?

38:22.678 --> 38:24.680
You know that note
you found stuck to the TV?

38:24.763 --> 38:27.474
- Reggie made the appointment.
- Right before he died.

38:27.558 --> 38:29.184
Don't let me disturb you.

38:30.143 --> 38:32.020
Sorry, ma'am. I didn't order more.

38:32.104 --> 38:35.315
Name is Sonia. And I could look at you
and tell you got a good appetite.

38:35.399 --> 38:36.441
It's on the house.

38:40.195 --> 38:41.488
Look at you, blushing.

38:41.572 --> 38:44.783
- Blushing and you're Black.
- Stop, man.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.077
I mean, I was gonna say that--

38:49.288 --> 38:51.498
I know getting you better was
always on Reggie's mind.

38:52.624 --> 38:54.168
What else was on Reggie's mind?

38:54.835 --> 38:56.837
Wife and kids. He really loved them.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.964
Wasn't worried about
nobody trying to kill him?

38:59.047 --> 39:00.966
Wasn't nothin' goin' on, Uncle.

39:01.466 --> 39:02.968
He ain't die by accident.

39:05.846 --> 39:07.431
Robyn's right, sir.

39:07.514 --> 39:10.434
I mean, Reggie was a good man. The best.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.561
It's just one of those bad things
that happened.

39:12.644 --> 39:14.271
For no good reason.

39:14.354 --> 39:17.441
It's messed up,
but that's just how it is sometimes.

39:23.906 --> 39:25.407
When you was at work,

39:25.490 --> 39:28.619
Billy Freres come with her
and loaded everything in his car.

39:29.369 --> 39:31.413
See, she probably moved in with Uncle Grey

39:31.496 --> 39:33.874
so she could get her hands
on his retirement checks.

39:34.666 --> 39:36.043
I have a hard time believing

39:36.126 --> 39:39.213
that a good girl like her
would do something like that.

39:39.963 --> 39:42.591
A good girl that sleep
with a knife under her pillow?

39:43.467 --> 39:44.676
Come on.

39:48.096 --> 39:50.349
How much you say Pitypapa get
from the city?

39:50.933 --> 39:53.268
Three checks, almost $300.

39:53.852 --> 39:56.063
And he's so crazy, he just throw it away.

39:56.730 --> 39:59.566
People in his neighborhood talking
about he got a whole box full of money

39:59.650 --> 40:00.943
somewhere in all that mess.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.570
You really think he that far gone?

40:04.071 --> 40:05.614
You've seen him, Mama.

40:05.697 --> 40:07.908
When he talk,
you can hardly understand him.

40:08.408 --> 40:10.118
And he see people that ain't there.

40:10.827 --> 40:14.748
Robyn said she was gonna stay with him?
Not just help him out like I asked.

40:14.831 --> 40:17.876
She was gonna live right there with him
in that foul apartment?

40:18.544 --> 40:19.545
That what she say.

40:21.296 --> 40:23.173
I'm tellin' you, Mama.
She after his money.

40:24.675 --> 40:27.636
You need to get the city
to look into this, know what I'm saying?

40:27.719 --> 40:32.391
Like, maybe it's time to put him
in a facility or something, you know?

40:32.474 --> 40:33.559
For his own good.

40:34.226 --> 40:36.144
All they gotta do is see how he living

40:36.228 --> 40:38.188
and they gonna pull him out of there
in a minute.

40:39.273 --> 40:40.274
Trust me.

40:50.325 --> 40:55.163
I drove a ice truck, worked as a janitor
down at the post office.

40:55.247 --> 40:56.790
Had a bunch of other jobs.

40:58.083 --> 41:04.464
I come to Georgia 'cause my sister, June,
said her children need family near.

41:06.091 --> 41:08.468
Now, on June's side of the street,

41:08.552 --> 41:10.304
there was the Joneses,

41:10.387 --> 41:14.850
the Pettys, George and Marion White,

41:15.976 --> 41:19.563
and… Bunny Rogers.

41:19.646 --> 41:22.024
Bunny? That's a woman?

41:22.107 --> 41:26.195
No, no, no, Lord. Bunny Rogers was a man.

41:26.278 --> 41:30.073
- Bunny Rogers killed Tommy Bottoms…
- What?

41:30.157 --> 41:34.036
…did not do a minute, did not stand trial.

41:34.119 --> 41:35.120
Wow.

41:37.664 --> 41:40.375
I can see it all so clear now.

41:41.960 --> 41:45.589
I can see everything
except that one thing…

41:46.423 --> 41:48.592
where I put Coydog's treasure.

41:49.593 --> 41:51.512
Don't worry. It'll come.

41:52.304 --> 41:56.892
And until then, you can think
sweet thoughts about your new girlfriend.

41:58.519 --> 42:00.270
Shirley's nice.

42:00.354 --> 42:03.023
But she ain't the kind of girl
you dream on.

42:04.024 --> 42:05.359
Now, Sensia…

42:06.902 --> 42:12.324
I ain't never been happier anyplace
than I was with Sensia.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.705
You should lay down now, Uncle.

42:23.377 --> 42:26.213
Sensia the most beautiful woman
I ever beheld.

42:26.296 --> 42:29.132
That's it. Nice thoughts.

42:42.187 --> 42:44.439
Sensia worth giving up my life for.

42:48.485 --> 42:49.653
Sleep tight.

44:38.095 --> 44:39.179
I'll be right back.

44:48.605 --> 44:52.442
Hey. Was that you I saw running?

44:55.487 --> 44:56.947
My uncle Coydog--

44:57.447 --> 44:59.992
What kind of name is Coydog?

45:00.075 --> 45:04.037
Well, he's not really my uncle,
that's just what I called him.

45:04.121 --> 45:08.125
But Coydog was his name, 'cause, well,

45:08.208 --> 45:10.627
that's the only name
I ever heard anybody ever call him.

45:13.589 --> 45:14.840
Well?

45:15.340 --> 45:18.302
What does your not-uncle Coydog
have to do with you running?

45:19.887 --> 45:21.305
Coydog said,

45:21.388 --> 45:26.310
"There will come a time in every Black
man's life when he's gonna have to run.

45:26.393 --> 45:27.769
So, if you don't practice,

45:27.853 --> 45:32.274
when that time comes, you may not be able
to reach the required speed."

45:33.358 --> 45:34.902
Sounds like a smart man.

45:34.985 --> 45:36.236
He was.

45:37.571 --> 45:38.739
What you reading?

45:40.199 --> 45:41.283
Love story?

45:42.284 --> 45:45.287
Well, it's about two men
that don't know each other

45:45.370 --> 45:46.413
who wanna kill people.

45:46.496 --> 45:47.789
Different people.

45:47.873 --> 45:50.542
But they know if they did it theyself
they would get in trouble.

45:50.626 --> 45:53.712
So they swap. You know, victims.

45:54.379 --> 45:55.923
Well, I don't like murder stories.

45:56.006 --> 45:58.258
Too much blood and violence for me.

45:58.342 --> 46:01.011
It don't matter what you read,
just as long as you read something.

46:01.094 --> 46:03.764
- Coydog-- Coydog…
- Uh-huh.

46:03.847 --> 46:04.848
…always said,

46:04.932 --> 46:08.268
"The best thing a Black man can do is
know how to read and think for himself."

46:09.645 --> 46:11.855
I think I would have liked your uncle.

46:11.939 --> 46:13.815
He sure enough would have liked you.

46:13.899 --> 46:15.609
And why you say that?

46:19.905 --> 46:22.616
I'm Sensia. Sensia Howard.

46:24.451 --> 46:26.328
Ptolemy Grey.

46:26.995 --> 46:29.122
A lot of folk think
that's an African name,

46:29.206 --> 46:30.999
but really it's Greek.

46:31.583 --> 46:33.585
You got family from there?

46:33.669 --> 46:35.879
My mama loved history.

46:35.963 --> 46:39.883
So, when Alexander the Great
conquered Egypt,

46:39.967 --> 46:42.845
300 years before Jesus was born,

46:42.928 --> 46:46.181
the governors became kings-- or pharaohs.

46:46.265 --> 46:47.850
And three of 'em was named Ptolemy.

46:47.933 --> 46:49.560
One of them was Cleopatra's daddy.

46:49.643 --> 46:53.939
So, not only was he Greek,
he was the king of Egypt.

46:55.816 --> 46:57.109
Tell me something, Ptolemy…

46:59.194 --> 47:01.780
you ever read out loud at night
to your girlfriend?

47:05.033 --> 47:06.034
Sensia.

47:07.327 --> 47:08.328
Yeah?

47:10.163 --> 47:12.040
They're getting ready
to have that barbecue.

47:12.124 --> 47:13.959
I'm not hungry, Ezra.

47:14.042 --> 47:19.006
This here is Mr. Ptolemy Grey.
Named after a Greek king of Egypt.

47:22.009 --> 47:24.595
- King, huh?
- It's just a name.

47:25.387 --> 47:26.889
Well, look, we got to get going.

47:28.891 --> 47:30.767
Why don't you come on with us, Mr. Grey?

47:30.851 --> 47:32.269
He's not invited.

47:33.604 --> 47:36.106
Well, then, maybe I'll just sit here
and talk for a while

47:36.190 --> 47:37.608
and be up in a little bit.

47:38.150 --> 47:39.318
I said, come on.

47:39.401 --> 47:40.611
Ezra, stop!

47:40.694 --> 47:42.529
Ain't got to be grabbing
on the lady like that.

47:42.613 --> 47:44.698
Man, you best mind
your motherfucking business, nigga.

47:44.781 --> 47:48.160
Ezra! You don't wanna be fighting
on no Sunday.

47:50.537 --> 47:51.538
Come on.

47:53.290 --> 47:54.333
Come on.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.043
A'ight.

48:18.982 --> 48:20.776
What you doin' here again?

48:23.612 --> 48:25.697
I already told you,

48:25.781 --> 48:28.825
my aunt Alberta taught me
never to let a man mistreat me.

48:29.493 --> 48:33.455
But then I couldn't be with no other man
for at least three days,

48:33.539 --> 48:35.082
lest I be called a trollop.

48:36.917 --> 48:39.795
Ezra grabbed on me on Sunday,

48:39.878 --> 48:43.006
and this here is Wednesday night.

48:49.054 --> 48:52.140
If you had a free day,

48:53.767 --> 48:57.479
rent paid and some money in the bank,
what would you do?

48:58.188 --> 48:59.231
This here.

49:03.277 --> 49:05.237
If you were alone?

49:05.320 --> 49:07.364
Oh, that.

49:11.243 --> 49:15.789
Get up before the sun.
Take the bus down to Lake Allatoona.

49:15.873 --> 49:18.041
Take off my shoes and socks.

49:18.125 --> 49:22.337
Walk down to the shoreline
and watch the sun come up.

49:23.255 --> 49:24.256
That all?

49:25.674 --> 49:30.179
Then I'd go over to the High Museum
and surround myself with beauty.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.474
So, all you'd spend
on your day off is bus fare?

49:34.975 --> 49:37.060
I'd probably buy me
a sandwich and a drink.

49:38.061 --> 49:40.480
Then, later on, treat myself to a book.

49:42.482 --> 49:43.817
That's why I'm here.

49:45.110 --> 49:47.321
I need to be with a man like you.

49:49.239 --> 49:51.575
A man to make every day a surprise.

49:51.658 --> 49:53.535
That's about all I can offer.

49:55.579 --> 49:57.456
My ma and Alberta also taught me,

49:58.040 --> 49:59.625
"You can't have everything.

49:59.708 --> 50:03.003
You gotta accept that
and settle on what you need."

50:03.504 --> 50:07.090
And what is it you need, Sensia Howard?

50:08.133 --> 50:13.055
I used to think I wanted a man
who could buy me fancy dresses,

50:14.515 --> 50:15.766
nice clothes.

50:16.725 --> 50:18.101
I got the clothes.

50:20.521 --> 50:22.689
But they fit like ropes and chains.

50:27.069 --> 50:31.949
Now, I want a man who can read to me
from some book every night.

50:33.867 --> 50:37.162
So, I guess I gotta settle on you.

50:38.914 --> 50:40.541
I got anything to say about that?

50:41.875 --> 50:43.377
Of course you do.

50:44.211 --> 50:45.963
As long as you say yes.

50:52.845 --> 50:54.388
Nigga, you better say your prayers.

50:54.471 --> 50:57.683
- Ezra. Ezra, now, you know we--
- Get the fuck out the way.

50:57.766 --> 51:00.269
- Man, I don't want no trouble.
- Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you!

51:00.352 --> 51:01.353
No!

51:01.937 --> 51:03.605
- Fuck!
- Ezra!

51:05.190 --> 51:07.025
See if you still want him
after I get through.

51:07.109 --> 51:09.403
Ezra, I'm warning you,
don't hit him again!

51:10.737 --> 51:12.197
Or what?

51:14.575 --> 51:16.743
I warned you never to lay a hand on me.

51:17.286 --> 51:19.621
I am not running to him.

51:19.705 --> 51:21.039
I left you.

51:21.623 --> 51:23.542
You gonna pull a gun out on me?

51:25.335 --> 51:29.047
You gonna shoot me?
For this piece of trash-ass nigga here?

51:30.090 --> 51:33.468
It's over, Ezra. I'm done with you.

51:34.887 --> 51:36.180
Well, fuck it, then.

51:38.432 --> 51:39.516
Bitch!

51:40.392 --> 51:44.688
God! Shit! Goddamn!

51:52.571 --> 51:55.073
Sensia, come on now, baby. Please, now.

51:56.158 --> 51:57.618
Please, baby. Please.

51:59.953 --> 52:01.038
Sensia.

52:08.086 --> 52:09.421
Get off.

52:15.344 --> 52:18.096
Why'd you stop me? He was gonna kill you!

52:24.144 --> 52:25.187
Lookee here.

52:26.104 --> 52:29.107
I don't mind starting this here thing
with a little blood.

52:30.943 --> 52:33.987
But I ain't about stepping over
no dead bodies to get there.

52:41.620 --> 52:42.621
Here.

52:44.540 --> 52:45.707
You keep it.

52:49.586 --> 52:52.464
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

52:53.257 --> 52:54.675
I could use some sleep.

53:09.857 --> 53:11.233
And when you wake up,

53:12.150 --> 53:16.530
you need to dig up that treasure
and put it to work.

53:23.412 --> 53:25.080
Bird! Bird, get up.

53:26.331 --> 53:27.416
What the hell?

53:28.041 --> 53:30.586
I remember it was right--
It was right there.

53:30.669 --> 53:32.045
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

53:32.129 --> 53:33.922
- What is?
- The black heart.

53:34.006 --> 53:35.007
What?

53:35.090 --> 53:36.967
I put it down in the floor

53:37.050 --> 53:42.222
when I fixed it
after Sensia shot a hole in it.

53:42.306 --> 53:44.016
- Sure did.
- You all right?

53:44.099 --> 53:47.352
I know it was right--
right down here somewhere.

53:47.436 --> 53:48.478
Uncle!

53:49.104 --> 53:50.731
- What you doing?
- It's right here.

53:53.066 --> 53:54.109
Come on. Let me help.

53:54.193 --> 53:56.069
- Come on, then.
- All right. But don't swing that.

53:56.153 --> 53:57.905
- Cut across that way.
- All right.

54:01.283 --> 54:02.659
There you go. Pull.

54:12.544 --> 54:15.339
Okay.
Ain't nothing gonna get in the way now.

54:16.256 --> 54:17.591
We 'bout to find it.

54:18.258 --> 54:20.052
Well, what are we about to find?

54:20.135 --> 54:22.179
The future, Bird.

54:23.138 --> 54:24.723
The future.
