00:18.176 --> 00:20.065
Ain't me with

00:20.213 --> 00:21.737
Oh, so you

00:37.897 --> 00:39.693
I like me a Town Car.

00:40.799 --> 00:43.321
Man look quiet and correct

01:02.988 --> 01:04.217
Bye-bye.

01:06.059 --> 01:07.720
Showtime.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.731
Shit, nigger, turn.

01:18.105 --> 01:20.126
Man got clubs.

01:20.274 --> 01:24.631
One day soon I'm walking out
with a Rolls, hear?

01:24.779 --> 01:26.866
Way you been going to school
up in this here room, son,

01:27.014 --> 01:28.268
I suspect you're gonna
walk out of here

01:28.416 --> 01:31.010
with Morgan-fucking-Freeman
to drive it for you, too.

01:39.093 --> 01:40.560
See y'all
next time.

01:52.374 --> 01:53.794
Yo.

01:53.942 --> 01:55.095
I'm up the grocery
on Monroe.

01:55.243 --> 01:56.540
All right.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.695
Water, $1.

02:36.820 --> 02:38.040
What the fuck?

02:38.188 --> 02:39.776
You think I dream of
coming to work

02:39.924 --> 02:42.212
up in this shit
on a Sunday morning?

02:42.360 --> 02:45.212
Tell all my friends
what a good job I got?

02:45.360 --> 02:47.886
I'm working to support
a family, man.

02:48.998 --> 02:50.852
Pretend I ain't
talking to you.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.388
Pretend like I ain't
even on this earth.

02:53.536 --> 02:55.624
I know what you are.

02:55.772 --> 02:58.126
And I ain't stepping to,
but I am a man.

02:58.274 --> 02:59.762
And you just
clip that shit

02:59.910 --> 03:01.397
and act like you don't
even know I'm there.

03:01.545 --> 03:03.012
I don't.

03:06.617 --> 03:08.140
I'm here.

03:09.654 --> 03:11.775
Look, I told you
I wasn't stepping to you.

03:11.923 --> 03:14.153
I ain't disrespecting you, son.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.515
You want it
to be one way.

03:17.663 --> 03:20.182
What?

03:20.330 --> 03:22.184
You want it
to be one way.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.519
Man, I don't
know what you're--

03:23.667 --> 03:24.987
- You want it to be one way.
- Man, stop.

03:25.135 --> 03:27.696
Stop saying that.

03:30.575 --> 03:33.099
But it's the other way.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.625
I'm saying, man, the way she
was all, "aah" on Chiquan,

05:39.773 --> 05:41.627
Iike, like,
like, like,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.130
"Laugh now,
stanky bitch!

05:43.278 --> 05:44.297
Laugh now, huh?

05:44.445 --> 05:45.466
How you like this?

05:45.614 --> 05:46.699
How you like I cut your
titties off, huh?"

05:46.848 --> 05:47.935
Man, get the fuck
away from me.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.202
"How you like I carve
your pussy to your chin?"

05:49.350 --> 05:51.004
Yo, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

05:51.152 --> 05:52.640
- What?
- He said leave him be, so leave him be.

05:52.788 --> 05:54.208
- I'm just saying.
- You're just saying.

05:54.356 --> 05:56.043
That's all you
ever do, just say.

05:56.191 --> 05:57.644
Dude, shit was
fucked up.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.158
So it was fucked up.

06:01.664 --> 06:04.620
Her father killed,
like, three police.

06:04.768 --> 06:06.521
- What?
- Nah, it's true.

06:06.669 --> 06:09.021
Her father killed like three police,
and her mama boil cats.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.125
- Nigga, please, man.
- It's what I heard. She boil cats and

06:12.273 --> 06:13.627
serve 'em and shit.

06:13.775 --> 06:16.029
Serve 'em to who,
boiled-cat-eating motherfuckers?

06:16.177 --> 06:18.532
- Who want him some boiled cats, huh?
- Heard that's how she live.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.001
Nigger, you been boiled.

06:20.149 --> 06:22.336
Laetitia live up one of them
group homes off Edmondson.

06:22.484 --> 06:24.506
In them places,

06:24.654 --> 06:27.384
you don't need to eat cats
to make you crazy.

06:31.194 --> 06:32.525
Hey, Coach!

06:39.671 --> 06:42.556
If the boy not coming, you might as
well let me and Michael go in the ring.

06:42.704 --> 06:44.325
Ain't none of y'all
seen Spider today?

06:44.473 --> 06:45.660
I ain't seen him.

06:45.808 --> 06:47.562
Now how in the hell
he gonna fight next week

06:47.710 --> 06:48.930
if he don't
show up to train?

06:49.078 --> 06:51.599
I tell you what--

06:51.747 --> 06:53.936
until the boy shows up
for his lesson,

06:54.084 --> 06:56.372
you can lace 'em up and
step on the mat one time.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.040
Ha ha ha!

06:58.188 --> 06:59.441
No no no no no.

06:59.589 --> 07:02.177
Not him.
Me.

07:02.325 --> 07:03.746
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

07:03.894 --> 07:05.047
Mm-hmm.

07:05.195 --> 07:07.050
I'm gonna show you as
gently as I can how much

07:07.198 --> 07:09.152

- A'ight.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.654
Yeah, nigger,
that's yo ass.

07:10.802 --> 07:11.962
You about to get
yo ass whipped.

07:20.343 --> 07:22.164
Your Sabbath best?

07:22.312 --> 07:24.934
You hang around, you can see me
preach on some young'uns,

07:25.082 --> 07:28.370
solemn left and
sanctified right.

07:28.518 --> 07:30.941
Why you down here on
a Sunday, Deacon?

07:31.089 --> 07:33.910
You need to see Ms. Donnelly
at Tilghman Middle.

07:34.059 --> 07:35.745
She's got some custodial work,
you might call it.

07:35.893 --> 07:37.648
Union wage.

07:37.796 --> 07:40.384
- Custodial?
- See Ms. Donnelly tomorrow.

07:40.532 --> 07:42.227
She can explain it
better than I can.

07:43.736 --> 07:45.190
Tell me something--

07:45.338 --> 07:47.024
how is it you got
so much wisdom

07:47.172 --> 07:48.961
about who
should be where?

07:49.109 --> 07:51.661
A good church man
is always up in everybody's shit.

07:51.809 --> 07:54.140
That's how we do.

07:55.446 --> 07:57.574
Yo, Coach,
you ready?

08:02.888 --> 08:06.043
Who's winning?

08:06.191 --> 08:07.645
No one wins.

08:07.793 --> 08:10.114
One side just
loses more slowly.

08:10.262 --> 08:14.753
Why don't we get
out of the house?

08:14.901 --> 08:17.956
Take a walk.
It's a nice day.

08:18.104 --> 08:21.226
I got this talk I got to
give to my first period...

08:21.374 --> 08:23.828
about what happened.

08:23.976 --> 08:25.705
An hour.

08:27.613 --> 08:29.968
I got--

08:30.116 --> 08:31.969
I gotta say something
to those kids.

08:32.116 --> 08:33.537
I mean--

08:33.684 --> 08:35.515
Okay.

08:37.623 --> 08:40.957
See?
Somebody's winning.

08:44.597 --> 08:46.419
I didn't expect
you till tomorrow.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.855
I heard my new squad
had the weekend shift.

08:49.003 --> 08:51.858
And besides, I figured
if I got my shit

08:52.007 --> 08:53.660
out of Major Crimes
on the Sunday,

08:53.808 --> 08:56.397
I wouldn't have to run into
that cocksucker Marimow.

08:56.545 --> 09:00.065
Marimow does not
cast off talent lightly.

09:00.213 --> 09:02.868
He heaves it away
with great force.

09:03.016 --> 09:04.537
Freamon got
here Friday.

09:04.685 --> 09:07.372
Yeah, Lester's
quick like that.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.043
There's the colonel's office.

09:10.191 --> 09:13.346
This is my humble abode.
The board.

09:13.494 --> 09:16.088
And over here,
this is your desk.

09:19.367 --> 09:22.022
- It's clean.
- You'll fix that.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.425
A clean desk is
the sign of a sick mind.

09:24.573 --> 09:26.860
Homicide.

09:27.008 --> 09:27.961
Damn.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.198
I don't know where
your chair went.

09:30.346 --> 09:31.564
Make that your
first case.

09:31.712 --> 09:33.771
And put that down, will you?
You live here now.

09:36.050 --> 09:37.870
Ooh, look.

09:38.018 --> 09:39.610
Actual po-lice work.

09:45.393 --> 09:49.550
- Any of these?
- He the one, right there.

09:49.698 --> 09:51.118
Just put it
to Fruit's head,

09:51.266 --> 09:53.421
and the next thing Fruit
on the ground flopping,

09:53.569 --> 09:55.223
and his girl
all screaming,

09:55.371 --> 09:58.525
and this pink shit coming out
the side of his head.

09:58.673 --> 10:00.428
"The Bunk,"

10:00.576 --> 10:02.097
working weekends.

10:02.245 --> 10:03.898
The man's dedicated.

10:04.046 --> 10:07.634
I'm gonna partner you with
Crutchfield to get started.

10:07.782 --> 10:10.104
You won't catch anything
as a primary for the first few months.

10:10.252 --> 10:12.439
Give you time
to learn the basics.

10:12.587 --> 10:14.441
Our H files by year.

10:14.589 --> 10:17.345
Witness dump.

10:17.493 --> 10:20.281
Our cut necktie
mausoleum.

10:20.429 --> 10:22.784
The coffee...

10:22.932 --> 10:26.368
and the mailboxes, arranged
by shift and squad.

10:27.737 --> 10:29.190
Lester.

10:29.339 --> 10:31.460
I believe you two refugees
know each other well.

10:31.608 --> 10:33.863
Still getting your
head around it?

10:34.011 --> 10:35.464
A bit, yeah.

10:35.612 --> 10:37.333
You'll do fine.
Just fine.

10:37.481 --> 10:40.813
As tender as this moment may be,
Detective, you've got mail.

10:43.819 --> 10:47.143
You got Lyon
on your ass already?

10:47.291 --> 10:49.645
Another switch-up
on the methane probes.

10:49.793 --> 10:52.281
I'd call that number.

10:52.429 --> 10:54.483
Get on top of that shit
before you catch a case,

10:54.631 --> 10:55.962
chair or no chair.

11:11.115 --> 11:13.605
What the hell is
a methane probe?

11:17.821 --> 11:19.241
Hello, Kathleen O'Shea.

11:19.389 --> 11:21.277
- Yes, hello?
- Mm-hmm.

11:21.425 --> 11:24.980
I need to speak with Mr. Lyon
about the protocols.

11:25.128 --> 11:26.715
I beg your pardon?

11:26.863 --> 11:28.450
Mr. Lyon, please.

11:28.598 --> 11:30.620
You sound a little
old for this, hon.

11:30.768 --> 11:33.390
Excuse me?
Who is this?

11:33.538 --> 11:35.393
This is Detective
Greggs with the--

11:35.541 --> 11:37.795
This is
the Baltimore City Zoo.

11:37.943 --> 11:40.364
Fine, and this is
Detective Greggs--

11:40.512 --> 11:42.844
and you're calling
for a "Mr. Lion."

11:46.086 --> 11:48.004
I'm sorry.

11:48.152 --> 11:49.406
I misdialed.

11:49.554 --> 11:52.242
Hee hee hee.

11:52.390 --> 11:54.256
Methane probe.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.689
- Scarred-up faggot.
- Hmm.

12:04.837 --> 12:06.090
I need to
hunt him down,

12:06.238 --> 12:07.926
'cause there ain't no protection
against that shit.

12:08.074 --> 12:09.393
Huh.

12:09.541 --> 12:10.963
Can't plan
against that nigger.

12:11.111 --> 12:12.698
It's like, like,
you know what he's like.

12:12.846 --> 12:14.032
What he like?

12:14.180 --> 12:15.434
He like one of them
terrorist motherfuckers.

12:15.582 --> 12:17.469
Just blowing up
shit just to.

12:17.617 --> 12:19.671
Don't care who get hurt,
what kind of sense it makes.

12:19.819 --> 12:21.004
He got a point.

12:21.152 --> 12:23.774
And the government, right?

12:23.922 --> 12:25.843
If they have one of
them terrorist attacks,

12:25.991 --> 12:27.679
they cut Delta or
whoever some slack.

12:27.827 --> 12:30.248
The insurance companies,
the banks,

12:30.396 --> 12:34.085
the whole NASDAQ and shit get some
time to pay back what they owe,

12:34.233 --> 12:35.954
because the government know
ain't nothing they could do.

12:36.102 --> 12:37.389
Huh.

12:37.537 --> 12:39.758
Yeah, I know you see it.
You see the big picture.

12:39.906 --> 12:42.227
Problem with niggers today,
they always see the narrow view.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.695
That's nice.

12:43.843 --> 12:45.063
What?

12:45.211 --> 12:48.768
Oh, you like that?

12:48.916 --> 12:50.604
I had it for
a long time now.

12:50.752 --> 12:52.138
It's got some
sentimental values.

12:52.286 --> 12:54.441
- Just a thing.
- What's the real value?

12:54.587 --> 12:57.142
- Huh?
- Real value?

12:57.290 --> 12:58.877
I ain't much
for sentiment.

12:59.025 --> 13:00.545
Oh, you know.

13:00.693 --> 13:02.414
It's been a while
since I checked.

13:02.562 --> 13:05.618
I mean, the fluctuation
in the global economy and all.

13:05.766 --> 13:07.754
- I'll find out for you.
- You don't have to.

13:07.902 --> 13:09.927
I'll find out for you.

13:12.506 --> 13:14.761
Finger's swelled
over the years.

13:14.909 --> 13:16.563
- Need some help?
- Yeah, man, you need help?

13:16.711 --> 13:18.732
Nah, I got it,
I got it.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.101
- Maybe use some spit.
- I don't want the man's spit.

13:21.249 --> 13:22.739
No, I got it now.

13:27.289 --> 13:29.808
Omar ain't no terrorist.

13:29.956 --> 13:31.576
He just another
nigger with a gun.

13:31.724 --> 13:34.113
And you ain't no
Delta Airlines, neither.

13:34.261 --> 13:35.848
You just a nigger
got your shit took.

13:35.996 --> 13:37.684
So, bring me
what you owe

13:37.832 --> 13:41.120
and talk that global
economy mess somewhere else.

13:41.268 --> 13:42.855
Feel me?

13:43.003 --> 13:44.904
Yeah.

13:49.645 --> 13:51.665
I got another game.

13:51.813 --> 13:54.970
How much you
down already?

13:55.118 --> 13:57.238
Learning their ways
requires some patience.

13:57.386 --> 13:58.907
Some money, too.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.508
How much you need
this time out?

14:00.656 --> 14:02.178
A hundred and a half
ought to do.

14:02.326 --> 14:04.278
A hundred and a half?

14:04.426 --> 14:07.881
I take that chicken-nose
fool one day soon.

14:08.029 --> 14:10.652
Take Super Stick, too.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.620
Take 'em all.

14:13.768 --> 14:17.603
Else, maybe I get bored,
send you to take 'em.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.763
And my point,
Colonel Foerster,

14:21.911 --> 14:23.465
is that your man Norris,

14:23.613 --> 14:25.934
he's fucking the dog
on this, way I hear it.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.003
Sir, this is
a top priority case,

14:28.151 --> 14:30.039
and Norris knows there's a possibility
of a murdered state's witness.

14:30.187 --> 14:31.907
We don't even know yet

14:32.055 --> 14:33.642
if that was the motive
for the murder.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.312
This is my point.

14:35.460 --> 14:36.857
Norris is a pro, sir.

14:38.494 --> 14:40.985
His clearance rate this
year says otherwise, Colonel.

14:44.901 --> 14:46.755
Sir, Norris is
good police.

14:46.903 --> 14:49.625
Look Ray, we need someone
who can work it hard,

14:49.773 --> 14:52.228
work it around the clock,
work it till it falls.

14:52.376 --> 14:55.831
And I understand we just pumped
some fresh blood into Homicide--

14:55.979 --> 14:58.334
female, took one in
the line a few years back.

14:58.482 --> 14:59.936
She's never
worked Homicide.

15:00.084 --> 15:02.005
Fresh eyes, then.

15:02.153 --> 15:03.572
But with all
due respect, sir,

15:03.721 --> 15:05.275
if I could guarantee that
no further information

15:05.423 --> 15:06.711
on this case would be
leaked to the press,

15:06.859 --> 15:08.446
certainly not before
election day,

15:08.594 --> 15:09.946
would it be
possible to keep

15:10.094 --> 15:11.580
veteran investigators
working it, sir?

15:11.728 --> 15:13.821
I resent the implication.

15:18.469 --> 15:20.460
My apologies, sir.

15:23.074 --> 15:24.628
You killing my time
coming up here.

15:24.776 --> 15:27.230
And if you ain't noticed,
it's costing us money.

15:27.378 --> 15:30.500
How am I gonna trust you
if you keep telling lies,

15:30.648 --> 15:32.136
saying one thing
and doing another?

15:32.284 --> 15:34.172
I just missed Friday,
that's all.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.807
Look, think on it
like this--

15:35.955 --> 15:38.109
School is work. They're the
same thing right now.

15:38.257 --> 15:40.845
So, you skipping out on school
is like not showing up for work.

15:40.993 --> 15:44.280
And I done heard, made up,
and tested every excuse invented.

15:44.428 --> 15:46.917
So, unless you dead or dying,
there ain't none you can use.

15:47.065 --> 15:48.518
I told you I'm-a go.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.387
Yeah, okay, I know.

15:50.535 --> 15:53.699
For school or out the business,
you are gonna go. Come on.

15:55.373 --> 15:57.961
Falling behind now isn't the way
to start out a school year,

15:58.109 --> 16:00.331
particularly after
a three-year hiatus.

16:00.479 --> 16:02.166
We haven't seen you
since you enrolled.

16:02.314 --> 16:04.509
Is there a reason
you haven't joined us?

16:09.422 --> 16:12.377
Look, I know you reaching out
for Sherrod.

16:12.525 --> 16:14.947
I want to apologize
for the boy

16:15.095 --> 16:17.316
because he's been working hard
at helping me get a business going.

16:17.464 --> 16:18.850
But he need
to be here though.

16:18.998 --> 16:20.551
Ain't no
bout a-doubt it.

16:20.699 --> 16:22.019
It's up to him,
isn't it?

16:22.167 --> 16:23.654
That's what I've
been trying to say.

16:23.802 --> 16:24.789
That's it right there.

16:24.937 --> 16:26.457
What about it,
young man?

16:26.605 --> 16:28.494
I'm good.

16:28.642 --> 16:30.629
Okay.

16:30.777 --> 16:34.867
One thing though been
bothering me, ma'am--

16:35.015 --> 16:37.469
if Sherrod already missed
the last three years,

16:37.617 --> 16:39.505
should he maybe be back in
the fifth or sixth grade,

16:39.654 --> 16:41.207
instead of up with his age?

16:41.355 --> 16:42.575
I mean, so he can
follow the work.

16:42.723 --> 16:44.043
Social promotion.

16:44.191 --> 16:45.745
Excuse me?

16:45.893 --> 16:48.181
We don't have the resources
to repeat grade levels,

16:48.329 --> 16:51.385
and we feel to place the older children
in the younger classes

16:51.533 --> 16:55.052
is unfair to teachers who are
responsible for maintaining order.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.223
Your nephew has been
socially promoted.

16:58.371 --> 17:00.532
He's an eighth-grader,
headed to high school.

17:03.511 --> 17:06.566
Sorry, but Ms. Johnson's
here about Qadriyyah.

17:06.714 --> 17:08.944
Excuse me for a moment.

17:11.652 --> 17:13.806
- Bill, this is nuts.
- I told him that.

17:13.954 --> 17:16.377
You know if this gets out, who
do you think it's gonna land on?

17:16.525 --> 17:19.646
I got two years to make
40 and a pension bump.

17:19.795 --> 17:21.648
Look, I don't agree
with the call either,

17:21.797 --> 17:24.553
but it's his call,
not yours, not mine.

17:24.701 --> 17:25.587
He's the one
over at City Hall

17:25.734 --> 17:27.665
every day getting
his ass chewed.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.836
I don't care about
nothing you say, man,

17:42.984 --> 17:44.338
'cause if you start
shit, you can't

17:44.486 --> 17:46.340
complain how somebody
finish that shit.

17:46.488 --> 17:48.342
Man, she was on her
from the beginning

17:48.490 --> 17:50.912
with the mirror
and everything, man.

17:51.060 --> 17:52.823
I wouldn't have waited.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.721
Mr. Pryzbylewski,
this is Sherrod.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.020
- And he's all yours.
- Okay.

18:01.168 --> 18:03.433
Take a seat, Sherrod.

18:09.378 --> 18:12.032
Okay, listen up.

18:12.180 --> 18:15.537
I'd like to--
everybody--

18:15.685 --> 18:17.105
everybody,
I'd like to talk--

18:17.253 --> 18:19.414
Listen up!

18:21.792 --> 18:23.645
Now, we all know
something, um,

18:23.793 --> 18:26.816
unpleasant happened
here Friday,

18:26.964 --> 18:28.484
and, look,

18:28.632 --> 18:31.354
I know some of you are still trying
to get your heads around--

18:31.502 --> 18:33.265
Ain't my head
got a big old gash.

18:34.604 --> 18:36.991
And, uh, l'd
like to discuss--

18:37.139 --> 18:39.995
- Yo, is it true that you police?
- What?

18:40.143 --> 18:43.098
Miss Carmandy up in the office say,
"Mr. Prezbo, he police."

18:43.246 --> 18:45.433
- Yo, you police, man?
- You ever shoot somebody?

18:45.581 --> 18:46.936
I think we should
talk about--

18:47.084 --> 18:49.538
He ain't shot no one.
Look at him. Yo,

18:49.686 --> 18:51.774
you ever bust a man
named Ashanti Graham?

18:51.922 --> 18:53.643
Sometimes when
something bad happens--

18:53.791 --> 18:55.645
- That your dad?
- Nah, my brother.

18:55.793 --> 18:57.780
Why can't you tell us
if you shot somebody or not?

18:57.928 --> 18:59.249
- What kind of gun you carry?
- You Narco?

18:59.397 --> 19:00.984
I used to be police.

19:01.132 --> 19:03.520
Now I'm a teacher.

19:03.668 --> 19:05.355
But being a police isn't
just about carrying a gun.

19:05.503 --> 19:07.391
Yeah, right.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.057
It's about working
with the community.

19:09.205 --> 19:11.494
The community?
Y'all ain't been up in my community

19:11.642 --> 19:13.362
in a long time except
to whale on people.

19:13.510 --> 19:14.998
Yo, Mr. P,
you ever been shot?

19:15.146 --> 19:16.841
I mean, like, bah.

19:20.150 --> 19:23.340
Namond,
that's enough.

19:23.488 --> 19:25.243
Get up.

19:25.391 --> 19:27.778
Get up.
Get back in your seats.

19:27.926 --> 19:29.546
Thank you,
very entertaining.

19:29.694 --> 19:31.648
Sit down.
Get in your seats!

19:31.796 --> 19:34.285
Sit down, sit down.
Kwaneese, sit down.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.820
Sit down, now.

19:35.968 --> 19:39.233
Yo, Mr. P, you ever
choke somebody dead like--

19:40.841 --> 19:42.806
Yo, you ever
get videoed?

19:53.452 --> 19:56.407
Mr. P,
Ashanti Graham.

19:56.555 --> 20:00.321
You gots to know him.
He was a player for real.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.600
He work Sunday
to Thursday,

20:22.748 --> 20:24.669
7:00 early to
5:00 late.

20:24.817 --> 20:27.272
So, it ain't no
moonlighting thing, then.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.140
Nah, he ain't
no real police.

20:29.288 --> 20:31.543
He full-time on this
Mickey Mouse shit here.

20:31.691 --> 20:34.046
What he do again?

20:34.194 --> 20:36.219
Talked back.

20:38.064 --> 20:39.486
Go over Hilltop now?

20:39.634 --> 20:41.261
Yeah, we got
that, too.

20:50.577 --> 20:52.238
See ya.

20:58.385 --> 21:00.239
Decision time, son.

21:00.387 --> 21:01.979
Yo, what's your play?

21:11.365 --> 21:12.753
Well, I told Little Kevin
right there

21:12.901 --> 21:14.287
to shoot y'all both
in the head twice.

21:14.435 --> 21:16.457
But seeing as he
done walked away...

21:16.605 --> 21:18.259
Oh, you funny.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.961
Yeah, I guess
I'm on your package.

21:21.109 --> 21:24.264
Where the boy at--
Michael?

21:24.412 --> 21:25.632
Well, he ain't
no regular.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.700
He's just working
off a debt.

21:27.848 --> 21:30.904
- Why? Why you care?
- Never mind you why.

21:31.052 --> 21:33.213
"Why" ain't in your
repertoire no more, nigger.

21:53.443 --> 21:55.263
60-40 split on that.

21:55.411 --> 21:57.400
Do not be messing
with Marlo's money.

22:07.823 --> 22:09.478
Randy Wagstaff,

22:09.626 --> 22:11.146
you aren't a sixth-grader,
are you?

22:11.294 --> 22:13.181
Uh, hey, Ms. Reese.

22:13.329 --> 22:15.218
If you were
a sixth-grader,

22:15.365 --> 22:17.152
it would mean you
and the rest of the knuckleheads

22:17.300 --> 22:19.855
would still be in my
first-period English class.

22:20.003 --> 22:21.690
And that would mean
it was two years ago.

22:21.838 --> 22:24.494
And that would mean time stands
still at Tilghman Middle,

22:24.642 --> 22:26.929
and that would
be a catastrophe.

22:27.077 --> 22:28.932
I just forgot and
wore my old shirt today.

22:29.080 --> 22:29.967
Mmm-hmm.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.206
Well, if this isn't your lunch,
then where is your hall pass?

22:37.153 --> 22:40.775
Why not just write
it in crayon?

22:40.923 --> 22:42.653
Come on.

22:43.961 --> 22:46.048
Deacon says you're
a good man.

22:46.196 --> 22:48.251
Good enough to swing
a mop, I guess.

22:48.399 --> 22:51.454
- A mop? More like a vacuum cleaner.
- What?

22:51.602 --> 22:53.957
I get a few fellas like you
to help me out every September.

22:54.105 --> 22:55.592
You go out
on the street,

22:55.740 --> 22:57.593
you find these kids,
you drag them in.

22:57.741 --> 22:59.596
Oh, a truant officer.

22:59.744 --> 23:01.498
The system
hasn't been funded

23:01.646 --> 23:03.600
for truant officers
in 20 years.

23:03.748 --> 23:05.767
Where the hell you think you are,
Montgomery County?

23:05.915 --> 23:08.870
Nah, I keep a couple
custodial positions

23:09.018 --> 23:11.274
unfilled every year
just for this.

23:11.422 --> 23:14.877
Those kids? You haul 'em in,
you cross 'em off the list.

23:15.025 --> 23:17.413
Each kid, one time,
clear the list.

23:17.561 --> 23:19.115
Come October,

23:19.263 --> 23:21.528
you start on
the list again.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.721
Job's yours if you want it.
Pays $12 an hour.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.430
Excuse me, hon.
Sit.

23:39.783 --> 23:42.506
Why'd you
leave class?

23:42.654 --> 23:45.042
I got hungry,
couldn't concentrate.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.279
Maybe, Randy, you had another
reason for running the halls, huh?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.780
Tagging walls, maybe?

23:49.928 --> 23:51.449
Uh-uh.
You know I don't.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.650
I don't know anything.
I know it's the second week,

23:53.798 --> 23:55.653
and I got walls
covered with tags.

23:55.801 --> 23:58.389
Does that make you feel good,
walking past that?

23:58.537 --> 23:59.791
- I don't know.
- Maybe you don't know,

23:59.939 --> 24:01.226
'cause you're the one
doing the marking.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.434
- I'm not.
- Then who is?

24:12.252 --> 24:14.104
- Miss Thompson?
- Yes, ma'am?

24:14.252 --> 24:16.441
Could you get me the number for
Randy Wagstaff's foster mom?

24:16.589 --> 24:18.276
- Not a problem.
- What you want to call Miss Anna for?

24:18.424 --> 24:20.311
Because you're skipping
class, running the halls,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.114
maybe worse. She's
got a right to know.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.283
- Is this her work number?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:24.431 --> 24:27.491
Hold on. Wait.

24:30.103 --> 24:31.824
The new girl, Greggs--

24:31.972 --> 24:34.360
Sir, if I may,
respectfully--

24:34.508 --> 24:36.028
Norris has
a full plate, okay?

24:36.176 --> 24:38.198
The Braddock case
goes to Greggs.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.233
His plate is fine.

24:40.381 --> 24:43.337
No, it's not. His plate's a pile of
shit, okay? Listen to me.

24:43.485 --> 24:46.373
Burrell wants this case
stalled until everybody votes.

24:46.521 --> 24:48.373
And Rawls?

24:48.521 --> 24:49.808
How the fuck I know
what Rawls wants?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.810
He never said shit.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.913
And let me tell you something,
even he knows this is fucked up.

24:54.061 --> 24:55.914
I have this correct?

24:56.062 --> 24:59.219
We are pulling a veteran off
a pending case and giving it to a rook

24:59.367 --> 25:01.855
so as not to make timely
progress on said case?

25:02.003 --> 25:04.665
The Braddock case
to Greggs.

25:07.442 --> 25:10.431
- A pilot program?
- For one of your middle schools, yes.

25:10.579 --> 25:14.140
- A $200,000 grant is attached.
- Free money.

25:16.118 --> 25:18.240
- I'm just trying to help, Mrs. Conway.
- Help how?

25:18.388 --> 25:20.242
You say that
your target group

25:20.390 --> 25:23.275
is repeat violent
offenders.

25:23.423 --> 25:25.111
Are you in any way
suggesting that

25:25.259 --> 25:26.780
the system's lost
control of the school?

25:26.928 --> 25:28.748
No no no, that's not what
I'm suggesting at all.

25:28.896 --> 25:31.051
The system's fine.
The system's great.

25:31.199 --> 25:33.688
I mean, this isn't
about the system.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.723
We're just gonna
try to find a way

25:35.871 --> 25:37.324
to get to some of
the troubled kids

25:37.472 --> 25:39.599
who won't be in the
system too much longer.

25:42.544 --> 25:45.333
Well, look, just make sure
there's no fuss.

25:45.481 --> 25:48.070
I mean, nothing that gets
anyone upset, you know?

25:48.218 --> 25:50.405
There's an election going on,
and we don't want to put our schools

25:50.553 --> 25:54.285
- in the middle of that mess.
- No, indeed.

27:06.130 --> 27:08.851
Humping a radio car
like a young sprite.

27:08.999 --> 27:10.319
I'm a little bit
proud to know you,

27:10.467 --> 27:12.489
- Officer McNulty.
- Just a little bit?

27:12.637 --> 27:14.892
Well, it ain't like there aren't better
things you could be doing.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.826
- Like what?
- See, I told you, Lester,

27:16.974 --> 27:18.829
the worm has
turned for my boy.

27:18.977 --> 27:21.298
So, I heard they
torpedoed your wiretap.

27:21.446 --> 27:23.333
Yeah, they sent us
a new lieutenant.

27:23.481 --> 27:25.702
- Marimow from E&T.
- "The Unit Killer."

27:25.850 --> 27:27.972
Lester and Kima already
bailed to Homicide,

27:28.120 --> 27:30.575
and now Sydnor's looking to jump
at the first good opening.

27:30.723 --> 27:31.709
So, Major Crimes
is dead, huh?

27:31.857 --> 27:33.778
Yeah, Lester
killed it good.

27:33.926 --> 27:35.280
Went looking
for the money.

27:35.428 --> 27:37.647
Guys like you,
you never learn.

27:37.795 --> 27:39.650
- Guys like me?
- Yeah, 13 years--

27:39.798 --> 27:42.252
- four months.
- Four months.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.256
- Ha ha ha.
- You guys call for backup or what?

27:45.404 --> 27:46.958
Yeah.

27:47.106 --> 27:48.693
We got arrest papers
on a murder

27:48.841 --> 27:50.694
for one Curtis Anderson,
aka "Lex."

27:50.842 --> 27:52.497
He's been on the wing
for a couple of weeks,

27:52.645 --> 27:55.333
so I don't expect him at
his mama's, but you never know.

27:55.481 --> 27:58.003
- What's the address?
- 643 Harlem.

27:58.151 --> 28:01.140
How about you taking the door
with me for old time's sake, Jim?

28:01.288 --> 28:02.374
I'll take the back, gents.

28:02.522 --> 28:04.343
- Oh!
- The back?

28:04.491 --> 28:06.545
Damn, junior, the worm
has turned for you.

28:06.693 --> 28:08.248
You know what they
say about the man

28:08.396 --> 28:09.649
who volunteers
to take the back?

28:09.797 --> 28:11.316
He buys.

28:11.464 --> 28:13.151
B&O Tavern,

28:13.299 --> 28:14.652
tonight at 9:00, son.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.722
- I throw myself out after one.
- Shit.

28:16.870 --> 28:18.393
You don't believe me,
ask Bunk.

28:19.639 --> 28:20.798
True.

28:31.018 --> 28:32.539
The bedroom's clear.

28:32.687 --> 28:34.207
Yeah, basement, too.

28:34.355 --> 28:35.841
Clear.

28:35.989 --> 28:37.423
Yeah.

28:44.564 --> 28:47.328
Clear.

28:48.402 --> 28:50.189
9:00 tonight, McNulty,

28:50.337 --> 28:52.828
B&O Tavern.

28:57.779 --> 29:01.010
He's not here.
I told you.

29:05.019 --> 29:07.580
Is he coming home again?

29:11.693 --> 29:14.993
Ma'am, is
your son alive?

29:17.200 --> 29:19.551
Because if he's not,

29:19.699 --> 29:21.454
we can end
this right now.

29:21.602 --> 29:23.823
Otherwise, we've
got a witness.

29:23.971 --> 29:26.259
That gives us
a murder warrant,

29:26.407 --> 29:28.862
and that warrant says that we
can come through your door

29:29.010 --> 29:31.274
as many times
as necessary.

29:33.382 --> 29:36.044
I don't know
where my son is.

29:37.786 --> 29:39.974
It's like them birds
of yours.

29:40.123 --> 29:41.977
They go out, and they
fly around the city.

29:42.125 --> 29:43.478
They free to do
as they do.

29:43.626 --> 29:46.381
End of the day,
they come back here,

29:46.529 --> 29:48.051
get water, get fed,

29:48.199 --> 29:49.551
'cause they know
you got this place

29:49.699 --> 29:51.785
set up regular
as the rain.

29:51.933 --> 29:53.787
No surprises, 'cause
at the end of the day,

29:53.935 --> 29:55.623
a man don't want
no surprises.

29:55.771 --> 29:57.858
You know,
birds neither.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.460
Same as what
I'm offering.

29:59.608 --> 30:01.228
You part of
a co-op,

30:01.376 --> 30:04.466
a whole lot of surprises
you never worry about again.

30:04.614 --> 30:06.735
You just do
as you do,

30:06.883 --> 30:08.603
knowing the product
will always be there

30:08.751 --> 30:10.138
and be
the finest quality;

30:10.286 --> 30:13.308
knowing that if one
of yours takes a pinch,

30:13.456 --> 30:15.745
he got a lawyer
and a bondsman

30:15.893 --> 30:18.314
waiting for him before he
even step out the wagon.

30:18.462 --> 30:19.983
I know how to
hire lawyers.

30:20.131 --> 30:21.751
It ain't just
about the lawyers.

30:21.899 --> 30:23.519
It's having a connection
so that you know

30:23.667 --> 30:25.521
before the bust
even go down.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.823
What I got to give up
to get that good dope?

30:27.971 --> 30:30.325
Muscle.
You got muscle.

30:30.473 --> 30:32.194
You stand with us,

30:32.342 --> 30:34.196
we run these New York boys
right out of East Baltimore.

30:34.344 --> 30:36.471
Fuck I care about
East Baltimore?

30:38.115 --> 30:41.804
The point of the co-op
is we stand together.

30:41.952 --> 30:43.973
We share information,

30:44.121 --> 30:46.142
and no one fucks
with any of us.

30:46.290 --> 30:47.510
No one fucks
with me now.

30:47.658 --> 30:49.380
Well, that don't
mean there couldn't be

30:49.528 --> 30:51.155
some unforeseen cir--

30:53.298 --> 30:56.699
No one fucks
with me now.

31:07.913 --> 31:10.366
African colors. Subtle.

31:10.514 --> 31:14.438
Tony Gray is
pulling 24% now.

31:14.586 --> 31:17.608
You need new colors and
a new message, Clarence.

31:17.756 --> 31:19.711
You need to
rally the base.

31:19.859 --> 31:22.012
You want me to start
wearing dashikis?

31:22.160 --> 31:24.182
Go all Marion Barry
and shit?

31:24.330 --> 31:25.517
I'll tell you what
I would like--

31:25.665 --> 31:28.353
another 75 in cash
for walk-around money.

31:28.501 --> 31:30.594
75, huh?

31:33.307 --> 31:35.125
Call another game.

31:35.273 --> 31:37.294
It's a waste of time,

31:37.442 --> 31:40.064
and right now,
time is everything.

31:40.212 --> 31:42.499
They're gonna spit in your eye
and endorse Royce.

31:42.647 --> 31:44.968
They only waited this long out
of respect to Tony Gray.

31:45.116 --> 31:46.937
Otherwise, they give
it to Royce months ago.

31:47.086 --> 31:48.573
That's not the point.

31:48.721 --> 31:51.009
You go there uninvited, and you're
only gonna piss them off.

31:51.157 --> 31:53.579
Am l? Or do I piss them off
even more

31:53.727 --> 31:55.714
by pretending that
they don't exist,

31:55.862 --> 31:57.248
that I don't need them?

31:57.396 --> 31:59.485
I've door-to-doored every
neighborhood in this city,

31:59.633 --> 32:01.454
saying I'm ready to be
mayor to all of it,

32:01.602 --> 32:03.756
not just my base,
but all of it.

32:03.904 --> 32:05.424
What does it say I don't
go see these guys?

32:05.572 --> 32:06.960
He's right.

32:07.108 --> 32:09.761
They endorse Royce, fine.
The hell else they gonna do?

32:09.909 --> 32:11.628
But what they say
and don't say

32:11.776 --> 32:14.265
from the pulpit that Sunday
before the primary,

32:14.413 --> 32:15.835
we still got a dog
in that fight.

32:15.983 --> 32:18.069
I do this right,
they'll respect it.

32:18.217 --> 32:20.805
And if they don't,
at least they get to see

32:20.953 --> 32:22.941
a begging-ass
white man on his knees.

32:23.089 --> 32:26.389
Always a feel-good
moment for the folks.

32:30.064 --> 32:33.053
And as to my attendance
at council meetings,

32:33.201 --> 32:35.422
those who know
the job understand

32:35.570 --> 32:38.458
there is more to
being a councilperson

32:38.606 --> 32:40.128
than just the meetings.

32:40.276 --> 32:41.760
Yes, Charles?

32:41.908 --> 32:45.698
Yeah, they putting a halfway house at
the end of my block. Addicts and such.

32:45.846 --> 32:47.967
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

32:48.115 --> 32:49.669
Where you living
at, sir?

32:49.817 --> 32:51.203
800 block North Carrollton.

32:51.351 --> 32:53.573
Oh, I'm gonna take
a look into that.

32:53.721 --> 32:54.908
Is there anyone
with a question

32:55.056 --> 32:57.511
for any of
the other candidates?

32:57.659 --> 33:00.380
Anyone with an issue,
a concern?

33:00.528 --> 33:02.849
Well, I would say
that with regard to

33:02.997 --> 33:05.419
the gentleman's concern
about the halfway house,

33:05.567 --> 33:07.354
that while I share
your concern,

33:07.502 --> 33:08.923
it's also true
that the city has

33:09.071 --> 33:11.159
thousands of drug
addicts in recovery,

33:11.307 --> 33:14.095
and those halfway houses
and shelters have to go someplace.

33:14.243 --> 33:17.404
Though not in
white neighborhoods.

33:20.882 --> 33:22.669
Ma'am, could I see that,
that Royce flyer?

33:22.817 --> 33:25.071
- Thank you.
- Well, that is a fair point as well.

33:25.219 --> 33:26.506
But these are people--

33:26.654 --> 33:28.508
our brothers and sisters,

33:28.657 --> 33:30.711
our children, our friends.

33:30.859 --> 33:32.847
And they are trying
to change their lives,

33:32.995 --> 33:35.657
and so it's up to us to
be responsible for them.

33:38.168 --> 33:39.588
Feel good to miss
a hand, huh?

33:39.736 --> 33:41.255
What's the point?

33:41.403 --> 33:43.525
Eventually, we all
got to ante up.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.227
Yeah, we do.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.295
But I can't believe he
had the balls enough

33:46.443 --> 33:48.363
to call two games
in one month.

33:48.511 --> 33:49.530
I mean, please.

33:49.678 --> 33:51.365
He's loading up on
walk-around money.

33:51.513 --> 33:53.734
He wants cash on the street
come election day.

33:53.882 --> 33:55.136
Carcetti got to him.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.205
Called it a war chest.

33:57.353 --> 33:58.752
Maybe we got us
a war this time.

34:03.393 --> 34:05.514
I wouldn't mind if he wasn't
so fucking ugly with it.

34:05.662 --> 34:07.849
That two pair he bet on,
right into Roger's trip nines.

34:07.997 --> 34:10.851
I folded on a flush.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.422
Full boat, four hands ago.

34:12.570 --> 34:15.333
It's immoral,
what it is.

34:19.210 --> 34:21.331
So, what's
the game, gents?

34:21.480 --> 34:22.811
Clarence's deal.

34:24.847 --> 34:26.101
Texas Hold 'Em.

34:26.248 --> 34:28.503
I begin to understand
the popularity of this game.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.975
No limit.

34:32.123 --> 34:34.556
Oh, peachy.

34:36.827 --> 34:39.282
I was beginning to
think you'd lost it, son.

34:39.429 --> 34:42.284
That living room
shrine of hers

34:42.433 --> 34:46.188
would have shamed
Elvis and Tupac both.

34:46.337 --> 34:47.725
Her son's deader
than both of 'em.

34:47.873 --> 34:49.360
She's just too scared
to say so.

34:49.507 --> 34:50.995
That shit wasn't
there the first time

34:51.143 --> 34:53.063
I talked to her.
I'd have seen it.

34:53.210 --> 34:56.500
- You being a detective and all.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:56.648 --> 34:58.410
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:59.716 --> 35:02.972
Hey, look,
she got a friend.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.442
She too young
for you, boy.

35:05.590 --> 35:08.478
Young?

35:08.626 --> 35:11.547
They get younger, William.
Skinnier, too. We don't.

35:11.695 --> 35:13.851
Younger, skinnier--
where's Jimmy?

35:13.999 --> 35:16.620
That's just the nature of
things. Age is age,

35:16.768 --> 35:18.857
fat is fat,
and nature is nature.

35:19.005 --> 35:21.526
- Aw, pitiful.
- And pitiless.

35:21.674 --> 35:23.295
Nature don't care.

35:23.443 --> 35:25.697
Nature just is.

35:25.845 --> 35:28.433
Now my boy Marlo, I thought
he was skewing that.

35:28.581 --> 35:30.169
Screwing what?

35:30.317 --> 35:33.036
- The boy's a young lion.
- "Hello, is Mr. Lyon home?"

35:33.184 --> 35:36.240
And a lion has
to have his kill.

35:36.388 --> 35:38.977
"Methane probe
for Mr. Lyon."

35:39.125 --> 35:41.945
- So then where are my bodies?
- Hmm.

35:42.093 --> 35:44.381
Here I am over here
on the one hand

35:44.529 --> 35:45.650
without a body
in six months,

35:45.798 --> 35:47.652
and here you are
looking for a suspect

35:47.800 --> 35:49.220
who's most likely dead,

35:49.369 --> 35:52.725
and most likely for
dropping one of Marlo's.

35:52.873 --> 35:55.461
Then again, if he's dead,

35:55.609 --> 35:59.332
where's that body?

35:59.480 --> 36:01.300
You know what
the plural of pussy is?

36:01.448 --> 36:03.402
Puss-i.
Jimmy taught me that.

36:03.550 --> 36:05.403
Where's he putting
the bodies, Bunk, huh?

36:05.551 --> 36:06.904
In the sewers?

36:07.052 --> 36:08.573
Rogue funeral
home, maybe?

36:08.721 --> 36:09.908
Yeah, they teach
that fancy-ass Latin

36:10.056 --> 36:11.444
at them Catholic
schools, they do.

36:11.592 --> 36:12.911
- You remember the Eddy Crane case?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:13.059 --> 36:14.979
Word was they put
him in an acid vat

36:15.127 --> 36:16.349
down near Curtis Bay.

36:16.497 --> 36:18.084
Oh, they're coming
up on us now.

36:18.232 --> 36:21.319
Now, for a West Side boy
like Marlo Stanfield,

36:21.468 --> 36:24.091
that would be the traditional
dumping grounds,

36:24.239 --> 36:25.291
- Hey, girl. How are your doing?
- Right?

36:25.439 --> 36:27.294
- Hey, girl.
- Right?

36:27.442 --> 36:31.264
What?
Oh, man.

36:31.412 --> 36:33.243
Jimmy.

36:35.016 --> 36:36.670
Jimmy.

36:36.818 --> 36:41.253
Tying to get some
of that puss-i.

36:43.524 --> 36:45.711
What the hell you still
sitting here for?

36:45.859 --> 36:48.794
Fucking Huxtables
and shit, right?

36:50.331 --> 36:52.586
There they go
right there.

36:52.734 --> 36:55.989
He's still
with school.

36:56.137 --> 37:00.094
Shit. Just so they can
spring out that shit pile every day.

37:00.242 --> 37:02.397
Make a good run
at that boy,

37:02.545 --> 37:04.532
he'll be on a corner,
no problem, man.

37:04.680 --> 37:07.444
Yeah, we gonna see.

37:09.351 --> 37:11.839
You hung-over?

37:11.987 --> 37:14.808
Just saying you
look like shit.

37:14.956 --> 37:17.344
You know what you need
at a crime scene?

37:17.492 --> 37:20.113
- Rubber gloves.
- Soft eyes.

37:20.261 --> 37:22.349
Like I'm supposed
to cry and shit?

37:22.497 --> 37:26.521
You got soft eyes,
you can see the whole thing.

37:26.669 --> 37:28.355
You got hard eyes,

37:28.503 --> 37:30.057
you're staring at
the same tree,

37:30.205 --> 37:31.794
missing the forest.

37:31.942 --> 37:34.296
Oh, Zen shit.

37:34.444 --> 37:37.413
Soft eyes, Grasshopper.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.012
Lividity puts the time
of death at 7:48,

37:51.160 --> 37:53.181
- give or take.
- Noted.

37:53.329 --> 37:54.682
You're gonna want
to get a chemstat.

37:54.830 --> 37:56.418
- You think?
- Couldn't hurt.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.052
A CDC, too?
Splatter distance?

37:58.200 --> 37:59.354
Yeah, definitely.

37:59.502 --> 38:02.090
You know, where the hell
did my Q-tips go?

38:02.238 --> 38:03.759
Don't sweat it.
I got mine right here.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.594
Oh, good. It's cool.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.176
You want to take a look?
Won't bite.

38:11.148 --> 38:13.436
Hey, uh, don't forget
the, uh, stippling.

38:13.584 --> 38:15.805
I'm a rookie?

38:15.953 --> 38:17.907
There's something
in his hand.

38:18.055 --> 38:18.942
Oh, yeah?

38:19.090 --> 38:21.454
Give her some
tweezers.

38:33.036 --> 38:36.058
"Tater killed me."

38:36.206 --> 38:38.328
Oh, is it typed?

38:38.476 --> 38:40.740
'Cause that would hold up
a lot better in court.

38:50.689 --> 38:52.179
Phone number in
the other hand.

38:54.358 --> 38:56.849
A standard
confidentiality agreement.

38:58.629 --> 39:00.884
And this one?

39:01.032 --> 39:02.585
Oh, that one
indemnifies us

39:02.733 --> 39:05.201
should you or any of
your staff be injured.

39:20.953 --> 39:23.008
- Who wants to get some learning today?
- This way. Move.

39:23.156 --> 39:26.421
- I roll up front with you?
- You got dibs in the back, little man.

39:27.594 --> 39:29.780
- Come on. Hey...
- Don't worry about him.

39:29.928 --> 39:33.751
- We'll catch him later.
- Yeah, little man's so excited

39:33.899 --> 39:36.459
about what's on that blackboard,
he gonna race us.

39:42.775 --> 39:43.862
What's the line
on us so far?

39:44.010 --> 39:46.198
In the teacher's
lounge, I mean.

39:46.346 --> 39:48.900
They're saying you're
this year's Band-Aid.

39:49.048 --> 39:49.935
Is that how
you feel?

39:50.083 --> 39:52.371
I was hoping for
more than that.

39:52.519 --> 39:54.307
This year's
splint?

39:54.455 --> 39:56.342
Hey, Miss Sampson.

39:56.490 --> 39:58.048
Yo, he police.

40:02.428 --> 40:04.615
I mean, the school
system seems benign.

40:04.763 --> 40:06.318
And I get the sense
North Avenue

40:06.466 --> 40:08.954
might give us some
latitude, if not support.

40:09.102 --> 40:12.732
- You think so?
- You sound doubtful.

40:14.441 --> 40:17.129
You can tell the days
by their faces.

40:17.277 --> 40:19.265
The best day
is Wednesday.

40:19.413 --> 40:21.033
That's the farthest
they get from home,

40:21.181 --> 40:23.002
from whatever's going
on in the streets.

40:23.150 --> 40:25.037
You see smiles then.

40:25.185 --> 40:26.839
Monday is angry.

40:26.987 --> 40:30.611
Tuesdays, they're caught between
Monday and Wednesday,

40:30.759 --> 40:34.482
so it could go either way.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.616
Thursdays...

40:36.764 --> 40:39.517
they're feeling
that weekend coming.

40:39.665 --> 40:42.221
Friday, it's bad again.

40:42.369 --> 40:43.893
This is where
I leave you.

40:46.674 --> 40:49.162
Oh, your class.

40:49.310 --> 40:50.796
Language arts, huh?

40:50.944 --> 40:52.466
Yes.

40:52.614 --> 40:55.369
Anyway, you should
see it without me.

40:55.517 --> 40:57.372
They behave differently
when I'm around.

40:57.520 --> 41:01.046
No doubt.

41:19.041 --> 41:21.996
What do you think
this 20 stands for?

41:22.144 --> 41:24.699
No, it's not the number
of days you've been suspended.

41:24.847 --> 41:26.701
It's not the number
of years you'll spend

41:26.849 --> 41:28.703
in prison if you
don't shape up.

41:28.851 --> 41:32.073
It's 50% below average.

41:32.221 --> 41:34.575
It's 30% below
failure even.

41:34.723 --> 41:37.513
But, really, it stands
for the amount of interest

41:37.661 --> 41:39.356
you're taking in
your own future.

41:47.236 --> 41:49.590
The next question
is worth two points.

41:49.738 --> 41:52.094
Who can tell me why was

41:52.242 --> 41:54.196
Clarence Mitchell, Jr. important

41:54.344 --> 41:56.498
- to the civil rights movement?
- I know. I know.

41:56.646 --> 41:58.166
And I can tell by
Shalanta's smile,

41:58.314 --> 42:00.715
she's gonna win
for the blue team.

42:03.587 --> 42:05.954
Hey, yo, did you see that one
over there? Hey.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.551
Anybody here
DeShawn Price?

42:14.699 --> 42:17.354
Never heard of him.

42:17.502 --> 42:18.921
And what's your name?

42:19.069 --> 42:21.223
Herbert Brown. This
the roundup van, right?

42:21.371 --> 42:22.925
Oh, yeah,
here you go, my man.

42:23.073 --> 42:23.959
Come on.

42:24.107 --> 42:25.461
Oh, no, yo, no.

42:25.609 --> 42:28.130
Yeah, see, "Howard Brown."

42:28.278 --> 42:30.933
That's my brother. He over
on McHenry Street if you want him.

42:31.081 --> 42:32.469
I was just in
school on Friday,

42:32.617 --> 42:36.039
so I'm phat till
October. Sorry.

42:36.187 --> 42:39.142
- Whoa, hold up, my man.
- Nah, he's right.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.112
School gets a certain
amount of money

42:41.260 --> 42:44.115
for each kid that shows
up one day in September

42:44.263 --> 42:46.617
- and one day in October.
- One day?

42:46.765 --> 42:48.887
After that, they don't
lose the government money,

42:49.035 --> 42:50.421
so we done with it.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.422
Nah nah, man.
School is school.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.225
Yeah, well, I'm just trying to
school you, brother.

42:55.373 --> 42:56.726
All right,

42:56.874 --> 42:58.461
which one of y'all still
need your September day?

42:58.609 --> 43:01.397
Get it over with now,

43:01.545 --> 43:03.979
we won't be messing
with y'all later.

43:16.295 --> 43:18.958
What up, Butch?

43:31.410 --> 43:33.464
How do we begin?

43:33.612 --> 43:36.434
You the one
called the meet.

43:36.582 --> 43:39.983
Why don't we begin by you
respecting my time and getting to it?

43:41.154 --> 43:43.308
First of all,
I heard you may be

43:43.456 --> 43:45.343
under the impression
I was somehow involved

43:45.491 --> 43:46.945
with the late Mr. Bell,

43:47.093 --> 43:49.618
in his play against you
with Brother Mouzone.

43:50.830 --> 43:53.619
I was no way involved.
Stringer came at me

43:53.767 --> 43:55.822
to set up the parley
with you.

43:55.970 --> 43:58.090
He used me like
he used y'all,

43:58.238 --> 43:59.624
I feel the need to say.

43:59.772 --> 44:02.626
It's said then.
Tip out on it.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.296
Businessman such as myself

44:04.444 --> 44:05.997
does not believe
in bad blood

44:06.145 --> 44:08.366
with a man
such as yourself.

44:08.514 --> 44:11.244
- Disturbs the sleep.
- Oh, I bet it do.

44:12.385 --> 44:14.650
By way of amends,
a proposition.

44:16.123 --> 44:17.977
I know of a card game
on the West Side--

44:18.125 --> 44:19.880
high rollers,
lots of cash money,

44:20.028 --> 44:22.216
boxcar-sized.

44:22.364 --> 44:23.883
You trying to
set me up, Joe?

44:24.031 --> 44:25.218
You ever known me
to be stupid?

44:25.366 --> 44:27.921
I'm trying to make things
right here with you.

44:28.069 --> 44:29.656
How much we talking about?

44:29.804 --> 44:31.459
If there ain't at least
a few hundred K in that room,

44:31.607 --> 44:34.125
I wish myself blind.

44:34.273 --> 44:35.728
Serious, Joe.

44:35.876 --> 44:37.163
I say again,

44:37.311 --> 44:39.232
have you ever known me
to be a stupid man?

44:39.380 --> 44:42.301
- What are the strings?
- No strings.

44:42.449 --> 44:45.145
- What's your cut then?
- Quarter of the take.

44:47.621 --> 44:50.377
I scope this and it
don't look right,

44:50.525 --> 44:52.186
I'm gonna come back
on you now, Joe.

45:01.237 --> 45:03.228
Where did everybody go?

45:08.142 --> 45:11.098
- Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?
- Sir.

45:11.246 --> 45:14.535
- And you must be Dozerman.
- Yes, sir.

45:14.683 --> 45:18.050
Welcome to Major Crimes.
I'm Lieutenant Marimow.

45:19.488 --> 45:21.341
I see you just made
sergeant after driving

45:21.489 --> 45:24.979
the mayor around for less
than three months.

45:25.127 --> 45:26.754
You must be
a hell of a driver.

45:28.698 --> 45:30.885
Anyone here?
Greggs? Freamon?

45:31.033 --> 45:32.253
Sydnor and Massey.

45:32.401 --> 45:35.090
And they're on the street,
making rips.

45:35.238 --> 45:36.692
That's what we
do here now.

45:36.840 --> 45:40.163
We get on the street
and we rip and run.

45:40.311 --> 45:42.330
Can you get
with that, Sergeant?

45:42.478 --> 45:44.571
The Western
District way, sir.

45:50.654 --> 45:54.385
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46:11.976 --> 46:13.630
Thanks for seeing me.

46:13.778 --> 46:15.596
I understand you've
already heard from

46:15.744 --> 46:17.466
Mayor Royce and
from Councilman Gray,

46:17.614 --> 46:18.968
and I'd like to thank
you for being able

46:19.116 --> 46:20.606
to join in this process.

46:23.386 --> 46:25.607
I don't expect to walk out
of this room today

46:25.755 --> 46:26.776
with an endorsement from

46:26.924 --> 46:29.044
the lnterdenominational
Ministerial Alliance.

46:29.192 --> 46:30.613
I don't.

46:30.761 --> 46:32.716
But the point is...

46:32.864 --> 46:35.518
I think I can be a better mayor for
Baltimore than the present one.

46:35.666 --> 46:37.921
I voted for Clarence Royce
eight years ago.

46:38.069 --> 46:40.358
I voted for him four
years after that.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.961
I felt there was
promise in the man.

46:44.109 --> 46:46.397
But now
I'm disappointed.

46:46.545 --> 46:48.333
I'm disappointed
and I'm angry

46:48.481 --> 46:50.100
at the crime
and the waste

46:50.248 --> 46:52.301
and the damage done
to so many neighborhoods.

46:52.449 --> 46:54.170
Not just in my district,
but here on the West Side--

46:54.318 --> 46:56.673
Pimlico, Cherry Hill,
Edmondson Village.

46:56.821 --> 46:59.176
Wherever I go, people
want the same things.

46:59.324 --> 47:01.612
They need the same things,

47:01.760 --> 47:04.181
but they're just
not getting them.

47:04.329 --> 47:05.683
I'm gonna change that.

47:05.831 --> 47:09.121
I'm not gonna ask
for your vote now.

47:09.269 --> 47:10.654
Maybe I haven't
earned it yet.

47:10.802 --> 47:13.090
But I am here to say
that when I am mayor,

47:13.238 --> 47:15.594
my door is open to you, regardless
of who you endorse.

47:15.742 --> 47:17.429
And I want you to remember

47:17.577 --> 47:20.138
that I came here today
to say these things.

47:23.982 --> 47:26.075
Thank you.

47:28.620 --> 47:30.908
Councilman.

47:31.056 --> 47:33.024
Thank you for coming.

47:37.997 --> 47:41.455
Okay, I'm gonna need an APB
on a motherfucker named Tater.

47:47.308 --> 47:50.897
"Call Mr. Sweet ASAP"?

47:51.045 --> 47:52.498
Let me guess--

47:52.646 --> 47:54.268
The Gay and
Lesbian Alliance.

47:54.416 --> 47:58.407
Uh-oh.
She's catching on, boys.

47:59.719 --> 48:01.239
Oh, and what do you want?

48:01.387 --> 48:03.241
Another methane probe?

48:03.389 --> 48:05.915
Or some other
"CSl" bullshit that don't exist?

48:07.694 --> 48:09.715
You're the primary
on the Braddock case.

48:09.863 --> 48:11.784
The dead witness.

48:11.932 --> 48:13.653
Norris is back
in the rotation.

48:13.801 --> 48:14.961
What?

48:18.505 --> 48:22.033
You caught your first murder.
Kudos.

48:30.518 --> 48:32.211
Come on, man, damn.

48:33.220 --> 48:35.374
Bam bam, yeah.

48:35.522 --> 48:37.276
Do that to whoever
be snitching.

48:37.424 --> 48:38.712
Who snitching?

48:38.860 --> 48:41.215
Don't know,
but kids be snitching.

48:41.363 --> 48:42.816
Rashid got suspended
for tagging walls, yo.

48:42.964 --> 48:44.585
Y'all ain't heard?

48:44.733 --> 48:46.487
How you know he ain't just
get caught with a paint can?

48:46.635 --> 48:49.189
'Cause Ms. Donnelly came and
pulled him out of the classroom.

48:49.337 --> 48:50.958
Bam.

48:51.106 --> 48:52.292
Yo, I'll see
y'all later, man.

48:52.440 --> 48:53.495
Yo, you going
past the gym?

48:53.643 --> 48:55.736
All right, man.
Peace, peace.

48:59.081 --> 49:00.970
I ain't gonna tell
you again.

49:01.118 --> 49:04.507
Give me the remote.

49:04.653 --> 49:07.213
Did y'all learn
something today?

49:08.957 --> 49:10.878
Y'all learn
something today?

49:11.026 --> 49:12.880
Yeah.

49:13.028 --> 49:15.088
What y'all learn?

49:16.165 --> 49:19.420
I said give me
the remote.

49:19.568 --> 49:21.222
- Mmm-mmm.
- Give it.

49:21.370 --> 49:24.659
Math your favorite, right?
Start with it.

49:24.807 --> 49:26.695
I like math.

49:26.843 --> 49:29.564
Yeah, you good
at it, too.

49:29.712 --> 49:32.273
Watched this show
five damn times.

49:41.756 --> 49:43.411
Hey, you good?

49:43.559 --> 49:46.221
All right now.

49:51.134 --> 49:52.820
So, it turns out
the one girl...

49:52.969 --> 49:56.091
200-something stitches
to close her up.

49:56.239 --> 49:58.827
She's looking at a lot of rehab
and maybe more surgery.

49:58.975 --> 50:00.864
The muscles in her face
don't even move right.

50:01.012 --> 50:02.966
How's the class seem?

50:03.114 --> 50:05.635
Like it didn't
really happen.

50:05.783 --> 50:08.905
They're still processing. I know
it doesn't seem so, but they are.

50:09.053 --> 50:12.210
What about Laetitia?
What happens to her?

50:12.356 --> 50:14.409
Nothing worse
than she's already seen.

50:14.557 --> 50:16.412
She'll probably go to
a juvenile facility,

50:16.560 --> 50:19.315
which is only a little
worse than her group home.

50:19.463 --> 50:20.684
She was in a group home?

50:20.832 --> 50:22.218
She grew up
in the system.

50:22.366 --> 50:23.720
Monday-to-Friday angry.

50:23.868 --> 50:25.956
Last year, she was
suspended twice,

50:26.104 --> 50:27.591
and then expelled.

50:27.739 --> 50:29.326
Chiquan wasn't
positive though,

50:29.474 --> 50:31.027
if you're looking for
a silver lining and all.

50:31.175 --> 50:32.597
Excuse me?

50:32.745 --> 50:35.008
She didn't have HlV,
in case you were worrying.

50:41.153 --> 50:43.507
Marcus. Boy, what are you
trying to do?

50:43.655 --> 50:44.809
You trying to
get knocked out?

50:44.957 --> 50:46.875
Drop your head, son.

50:47.023 --> 50:49.045
Left up! Get that left up!

50:49.193 --> 50:51.748
Pick your hand up.
Damn!

50:51.896 --> 50:54.126
Man, that boy
listen to anyone?

50:57.001 --> 50:57.888
All right, all right.

50:58.036 --> 50:59.457
Time, time.

50:59.605 --> 51:01.792
Not bad, y'all.
Not bad, Justin.

51:01.940 --> 51:04.662
Marcus, you got to concentrate,
man. Think.

51:04.810 --> 51:06.631
All right?

51:06.779 --> 51:09.901
Listen, I got tickets
to the fights tonight,

51:10.049 --> 51:11.703
Pikesville Armory.

51:11.851 --> 51:13.772
Now, I was gonna
take Justin and Spider,

51:13.920 --> 51:15.274
but Spider ain't
been hanging out,

51:15.422 --> 51:17.142
and, Marcus, I know you
got your mother, right?

51:17.290 --> 51:19.978
So, Michael,

51:20.126 --> 51:21.422
you want to see
the fights?

51:22.661 --> 51:26.427
- You going?
- Yeah, I'm in.

51:28.567 --> 51:29.687
Yeah, all right.

51:29.835 --> 51:30.921
All right.

51:31.069 --> 51:32.764
Come on, get this
headgear off.

51:42.249 --> 51:43.803
What the fuck
is that?

51:43.951 --> 51:46.405
Souvenir.

51:46.553 --> 51:47.782
What?

51:50.257 --> 51:51.811
Trouble with doing
it this way,

51:51.959 --> 51:53.613
disappearing
'em and shit--

51:53.761 --> 51:55.125
Nobody knows.

51:59.499 --> 52:01.320
I remember when
I was a kid,

52:01.468 --> 52:06.326
if you had a map
of the world,

52:06.474 --> 52:08.327
the playground over
at Baker and Moreland

52:08.475 --> 52:10.830
would be at
the center of it.

52:10.978 --> 52:12.865
And as I got older,

52:13.013 --> 52:15.668
the playground just
kept on getting bigger,

52:15.816 --> 52:17.375
went beyond
the neighborhood.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.176
Everything changes,
you know?

52:22.324 --> 52:23.510
One minute
the ice cream truck

52:23.658 --> 52:25.751
be the only thing
you want to hear.

52:35.002 --> 52:37.557
Next thing, them touts
calling out the heroin

52:37.705 --> 52:39.434
be the only thing
you can hear.

52:49.084 --> 52:51.539
What's that?

52:51.687 --> 52:54.121
Workbook I need
to use with this.

53:00.531 --> 53:02.149
So you read from
the small one

53:02.297 --> 53:03.716
and answer questions
in the big one?

53:03.864 --> 53:06.129
Yeah, ain't no thing.

53:16.913 --> 53:18.904
Yeah, I see that.

53:30.994 --> 53:32.825
I see that.

53:56.687 --> 53:59.041
All right, you see how
he keeping his hands up?

53:59.189 --> 54:01.044
Look at his feet.
Look at their feet.

54:01.192 --> 54:02.625
See how they keep
their feet moving?

54:05.130 --> 54:07.150
See what I'm saying?

54:07.298 --> 54:08.919
See how he stay
in close?

54:09.067 --> 54:11.019
That's how you take
away his power.

54:11.167 --> 54:12.922
Yo, dude is cut.

54:13.070 --> 54:14.490
Yeah, man.

54:14.638 --> 54:15.958
That's discipline.

54:16.106 --> 54:19.007
You take care your body,
your body take care of you.

54:21.980 --> 54:24.634
Yo, I bet his woman
is fine, man.

54:24.782 --> 54:26.682
Yeah, I bet
she is, too.

54:31.356 --> 54:33.824
Flush to the queen.

54:35.894 --> 54:37.521
Full house.

54:39.932 --> 54:41.686
All right, everybody,

54:41.834 --> 54:43.154
Iet me see them
hands, yo.

54:43.302 --> 54:44.688
Hands.

54:44.836 --> 54:45.995
Hey, yo, big man,
back up.

54:47.538 --> 54:48.892
I don't know about cards,

54:49.040 --> 54:51.294
but, uh, I think these four-fives
beat a full house.

54:51.442 --> 54:53.707
Hey, yo, banker,
cash me out, yo.

54:55.346 --> 54:58.713
Boy, you want a head on
that body, you best hop to.

55:00.319 --> 55:01.980
That's my money.

55:03.589 --> 55:05.878
Man, money ain't
got no owners,

55:06.026 --> 55:07.178
only spenders.

55:07.326 --> 55:10.387
I tell you something else--
I like that ring, too.

55:13.733 --> 55:16.965
Boy, you got me confused
with a man repeats himself.

55:29.448 --> 55:30.869
This ain't over.

55:31.017 --> 55:34.773
Oh, that's how you
carrying it, Shorty, huh?

55:34.921 --> 55:36.309
'Cause I can find
your peoples

55:36.457 --> 55:38.720
a whole lot easier
than they can find me.

55:40.695 --> 55:43.289
Wear it in health.

55:44.597 --> 55:47.066
No doubt.

55:58.545 --> 56:01.533
You see what I'm
talking about, Justin?

56:01.681 --> 56:03.969
That's what I'm saying.
That's the real deal.

56:04.117 --> 56:06.439
You keep training, I'm telling you,
boy, you can get there.

56:06.587 --> 56:09.208
See, the last fight
was the best.

56:09.356 --> 56:11.377
The Puerto Rican boy
had a good left.

56:11.525 --> 56:13.280
Yeah, shit was tight.

56:13.428 --> 56:14.715
Oh, this is it,
right here on the right.

56:14.863 --> 56:16.524
All right.

56:18.366 --> 56:19.720
- All right now.
- All right,

56:19.868 --> 56:21.733
- I'll see you tomorrow, Coach.
- All right.

56:32.780 --> 56:34.567
All right, now,
so you live over on--

56:34.715 --> 56:36.769
Hey hey, my boy,

56:36.917 --> 56:39.105
- I'm gonna take you home.
- No, no, thank you.

56:39.254 --> 56:42.109
Michael, come on now,

56:42.257 --> 56:44.657
Nah, no thank you.
I'm good from here.
