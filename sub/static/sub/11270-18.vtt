00:06.360 --> 00:10.108
Excuse me. I've got to powder
my nose in the men's salon.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:25.875 --> 00:28.282
You look a little like Tip O'Neill.

00:28.753 --> 00:31.872
Yeah?
You know, a lot of people say that.

00:32.005 --> 00:34.163
But I'm better-looking than he is.

00:34.299 --> 00:37.003
My God, you are Tip O'Neill!
How do you do?

00:38.427 --> 00:39.422
I'm Sam Malone.

00:39.553 --> 00:41.592
You used to throw for the Sox.

00:41.721 --> 00:44.009
That's right.
What are you doing here?

00:44.140 --> 00:48.006
I'm walking down the street
and a lady stopped me.

00:48.977 --> 00:52.594
Started to tell me her
philosophy of life and government.

00:52.730 --> 00:54.603
So I ducked in for a quick one.

00:55.357 --> 00:57.016
What can I get you?

00:57.150 --> 00:58.893
There you are!

01:01.320 --> 01:04.818
Mr Speaker, forgive me for being
relentless, but I want...

01:04.947 --> 01:07.355
Diane, step into the office
for a minute.

01:07.491 --> 01:10.741
- What? I'll be right back.
- No, she won't.

01:12.370 --> 01:15.821
One more quick one,
then I've really gotta run.

01:15.956 --> 01:20.747
Norm, what were you saying about
that do-nothing Congress in DC?

01:20.877 --> 01:23.830
- They're a bunch of clowns.
- You think so?

01:23.962 --> 01:26.334
Any average guy could do better.

01:26.464 --> 01:28.088
- Nah.
- Sure.

01:28.216 --> 01:31.833
This bozo could probably be
a better Congressman.

01:32.677 --> 01:34.551
I may run for office someday.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.755
Yeah? You do that.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.100
You're out of work, too?

01:42.810 --> 01:45.645
No, I'm Speaker
of the House of Representatives.

01:47.314 --> 01:48.808
Don't be ridiculous!

01:49.399 --> 01:53.526
That'd make you Tip O'Neill,
and me... a horse's butt.

01:54.695 --> 01:56.319
You said it, not me.

03:13.548 --> 03:15.421
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

03:16.509 --> 03:18.465
What can I do for you?

03:18.594 --> 03:21.926
I need something to kill time
before my second beer.

03:23.347 --> 03:25.589
- How about a first one?
- You got it.

03:25.724 --> 03:28.179
Glad you came in today. Big day.

03:28.310 --> 03:31.345
- What's going on?
- The Miss Boston Barmaids contest.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.637
- They pick the finalist.
- What is it?

03:33.772 --> 03:35.764
What is it?

03:35.899 --> 03:40.145
It's only the biggest event of
the year. Words can't describe it.

03:40.944 --> 03:43.102
Waitresses serve drinks
and one wins.

03:43.238 --> 03:44.780
Yeah, that's about it.

03:47.408 --> 03:50.077
Coach is particularly excited today.

03:50.202 --> 03:53.617
This year, the contest
is being held right here at Cheers.

03:53.746 --> 03:55.205
Alright! Is that right?

03:55.331 --> 03:58.699
I hate to burst your bubble,
but the contest's a phoney.

03:58.833 --> 04:01.538
You gotta fool around with the judge
to get in.

04:01.669 --> 04:05.084
- That's disgusting!
- Yeah, and he won't return my calls.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.666
Everybody, I want your attention.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.373
They picked the finalists
for the contest.

04:12.511 --> 04:15.180
And this year, Cheers is gonna win.

04:16.596 --> 04:19.882
Finally, they're letting in preggos!

04:20.017 --> 04:22.887
No, Carla, it's not you. It's Diane.

04:23.019 --> 04:26.352
- Diane's pregnant?
- No, no.

04:27.189 --> 04:28.813
She's a finalist, Coach.

04:29.566 --> 04:30.645
Give me a copy!

04:31.734 --> 04:34.604
That proves it. There is no God.

04:35.654 --> 04:37.729
She didn't say a word about it.

04:37.864 --> 04:41.232
She doesn't know about it.
I entered her without telling her.

04:41.367 --> 04:44.153
Why, Sam? Just to cause me anguish?

04:45.453 --> 04:48.370
Alright, she's not the best waitress
in the world.

04:48.497 --> 04:52.576
But she makes the other categories.
"Perky, pert, congenial and fun."

04:54.168 --> 04:55.199
And I don't?

04:57.004 --> 05:00.787
Sweetheart, you cannot join
the contest. You're pregnant.

05:00.924 --> 05:03.165
So? Proves I'm congenial.

05:05.010 --> 05:07.963
- Good point.
- Sammy, here she comes.

05:08.096 --> 05:11.796
I want this to be a surprise.
Pretend you don't know anything.

05:11.932 --> 05:15.383
Coach, grab her apron. Put it
next to the paper so she sees it.

05:17.103 --> 05:19.344
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

05:22.524 --> 05:24.895
You all look chipper today.
What's up?

05:27.486 --> 05:30.819
Come on! I hate this.

05:30.947 --> 05:33.734
- Tell me.
- Really, it's nothing at all.

05:37.410 --> 05:38.869
Something in the paper?

05:40.746 --> 05:43.498
"The Miss Boston Barmaid compet..."

05:44.791 --> 05:47.827
I hate female contests
with every fibre of my being.

05:54.048 --> 05:55.839
Why did you want me to see this?

05:56.550 --> 05:59.255
To make sure you felt
the same way we did.

05:59.386 --> 06:01.841
- Disgusting.
- Terrible.

06:01.971 --> 06:06.383
What ninny would let herself
be entered in a contest like that?

06:07.559 --> 06:08.887
This kind.

06:09.018 --> 06:12.387
- That's me!
- Takes guts to admit it.

06:15.815 --> 06:19.515
Who did this? Who is responsible
for this? I'll kill him!

06:23.613 --> 06:26.400
- You did this.
- That's it. Wong Song You.

06:28.117 --> 06:31.034
He got killed in the Orient
trying to rescue a nun.

06:33.329 --> 06:34.408
That's him.

06:34.538 --> 06:39.199
You entered me much as one
would enter a heifer in a fair.

06:39.334 --> 06:41.789
No. Come on, Diane.

06:41.919 --> 06:43.461
I mean, no.

06:43.587 --> 06:46.504
The judges come in,
secretly watch your work,

06:46.631 --> 06:48.505
and then pick the finalists.

06:48.633 --> 06:51.752
In a county fair,
you take the cow to the judges.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.336
- Thanks a lot, Coach.
- Any time.

06:59.099 --> 07:02.183
Come on, Diane.
I thought you'd be happy about this.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.018
Of course.

07:04.145 --> 07:07.679
I love being entered
in degrading female contests.

07:07.814 --> 07:10.222
Me, too, but I'm always pregnant.

07:11.109 --> 07:12.982
Come on. This is not degrading.

07:13.110 --> 07:17.107
- In Boston, it's a very big honour.
- Yeah.

07:17.906 --> 07:20.147
Di, it's really big, you know.

07:21.158 --> 07:24.609
Not as big as Mail Carrier
of the Year, but it's up there.

07:24.744 --> 07:26.322
Mail Carrier of the Year?

07:26.454 --> 07:29.822
Who do they give that to?
A postman or a pigeon?

07:31.708 --> 07:33.831
- Watch your mouth.
- It was a joke.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.126
Yeah?
Don't you ever, repeat, ever,

07:37.254 --> 07:40.872
joke about the US postal service
in front of any mail carrier.

07:41.090 --> 07:43.960
- Alright?
- He didn't mean anything by it.

07:44.093 --> 07:47.591
I'd like to see how fat and sassy
he'd be without his mail.

07:50.515 --> 07:55.057
- I don't know what came over me.
- That's OK. You had every right.

07:55.227 --> 07:57.551
The Post Office
is everybody's target.

07:57.687 --> 08:01.055
But when they want a letter fast,
who do they come to?

08:01.190 --> 08:04.309
- Federal Express.
- He's mine!

08:07.528 --> 08:08.856
Sit down!

08:08.987 --> 08:11.560
These contests perpetuate
the attitude

08:11.698 --> 08:13.986
that women are mere objects,

08:14.116 --> 08:18.243
to be judged and ranked according
to how well they serve man.

08:18.370 --> 08:22.319
Come on! Lighten up, will you?
Relax a little bit.

08:22.456 --> 08:25.243
This is not the UN. Have some fun.

08:26.292 --> 08:28.498
Do you think being scrutinised,

08:28.628 --> 08:31.544
poked and prodded
like a side of beef is fun?

08:31.672 --> 08:34.957
Not every day,
but on your odd Saturday night...

08:36.424 --> 08:38.832
What do you think I am?

08:38.969 --> 08:43.345
Are you kidding? I thought you
were cute. Is that such a big deal?

08:43.472 --> 08:45.014
Cheers has never won this.

08:45.141 --> 08:49.387
I thought might be nice if we did,
if you won it for us.

08:49.519 --> 08:52.685
I didn't think. I picked up
the picture and sent it in.

08:53.522 --> 08:55.265
Where did you get it?

08:56.566 --> 08:58.807
I... Well, you know, I found it.

09:01.737 --> 09:02.732
Found it where?

09:03.447 --> 09:07.395
You were pretty careless. I found it
lying around in your wallet.

09:10.410 --> 09:12.284
Don't go through my wallet again.

09:12.662 --> 09:14.286
Don't worry. It was boring.

09:14.413 --> 09:17.947
Sorry. If I'd known, I'd have
added something interesting!

09:18.083 --> 09:21.285
I never saw anyone
with so many pictures of themselves.

09:21.419 --> 09:23.043
With your cat, on your pony.

09:23.170 --> 09:26.206
You by your car
with your cat on your pony.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.413
I'm going to call them,

09:30.551 --> 09:33.670
tell them what I think of this
and that I won't do it.

09:33.804 --> 09:35.926
Come on. Damn.

09:41.184 --> 09:42.927
Paul.

09:43.978 --> 09:45.223
No hard feelings.

09:46.689 --> 09:48.515
No.

09:48.649 --> 09:51.649
The Sears catalogue
came out this week.

09:51.776 --> 09:53.815
It puts a strain on me.

10:00.616 --> 10:06.036
I would like to speak to the person
in charge of female dehumanisation.

10:06.162 --> 10:08.700
What do you mean, "Speaking"?

10:12.709 --> 10:16.836
This is in regard to the
Miss Boston Barmaid competition.

10:16.962 --> 10:20.710
I am Diane Chambers. I have
something to say about this contest.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.583
And all contests like it.

10:22.717 --> 10:26.215
I only wish the whole world
could hear what I have to say.

10:28.138 --> 10:30.177
There will be reporters there?

10:31.265 --> 10:33.507
From all the major papers?

10:34.810 --> 10:39.969
Well,... I guess if a contestant
had a few things to say,

10:40.105 --> 10:43.106
this would be
an excellent forum for 'em.

10:44.817 --> 10:48.020
Yes, I am every bit
as cute as my picture.

10:48.654 --> 10:51.440
Thank you.
I'll see you at the contest.

10:53.783 --> 10:57.151
Diane. I have one thing
to say to you, and I mean this.

10:57.286 --> 10:59.990
Stay in this contest,
or we're no longer friends.

11:00.830 --> 11:04.697
- I'm staying in the contest.
- Really?

11:06.084 --> 11:09.084
- Yes.
- Diane!

11:09.211 --> 11:12.911
You go to bed with me tonight,
or we're no longer friends.

11:18.802 --> 11:22.005
Well, I guess you can
just push friendship so far.

11:35.899 --> 11:37.938
Norm, hold this for me.

11:39.235 --> 11:40.895
What smells great, Coach?

11:41.028 --> 11:45.736
I just came from the barbershop.
They put on that zingy aftershave.

11:45.865 --> 11:49.447
That explains
why these flies are dying here.

11:52.162 --> 11:56.906
Diane. Listen, I've been to these
things before. I know what they want.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.827
It's personality
and customer service,

11:59.959 --> 12:03.209
but a nice appearance can't hurt,
know what I mean?

12:04.129 --> 12:07.545
- Sex?
- No, not sex, a nice appearance.

12:08.424 --> 12:11.840
If you lowered your blouse
off the shoulders...

12:11.969 --> 12:13.712
Absolutely not!

12:13.845 --> 12:18.056
Come on, just to check it out.
Come on.

12:23.186 --> 12:25.474
That's very nice.

12:25.605 --> 12:27.976
Maybe mess your hair up just a bit.

12:31.985 --> 12:35.898
That's nice. Lean against the bar.
Elbow up here, like that.

12:37.239 --> 12:39.859
Wet your lips a little. Pout.

12:42.951 --> 12:44.576
That's good.

12:45.412 --> 12:47.736
You said the judges
weren't looking for sex.

12:47.872 --> 12:50.078
They're not. I am.

12:51.708 --> 12:56.416
Just checked out the competition.
They look even better up close.

12:56.545 --> 12:59.878
None of those girls have got
what I'm looking for.

13:00.006 --> 13:02.793
- What's that?
- Low standards.

13:05.427 --> 13:09.673
Come clean. One minute
you're against this contest,

13:09.806 --> 13:12.759
the next you're all for it.
What's up?

13:14.309 --> 13:16.551
You don't like this contest, do you?

13:17.145 --> 13:18.687
It's a sham.

13:18.813 --> 13:21.350
Carla, you'll be happy to hear

13:21.482 --> 13:24.766
that I am going to
bring this contest to its knees.

13:26.611 --> 13:28.650
I like it so far.

13:29.738 --> 13:32.941
When they introduce me,
I'm going to make a statement

13:33.074 --> 13:36.905
denouncing those
responsible for this outrage.

13:38.286 --> 13:40.409
I love it!

13:41.747 --> 13:44.913
You know, there aren't many things
about you that I like.

13:45.042 --> 13:48.161
In fact, there is nothing
about you that I like.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.662
But I always say
all great friendships

13:51.797 --> 13:55.130
start with
one small act of vengeance.

14:00.804 --> 14:02.962
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

14:03.097 --> 14:07.675
<i>Welcome to the 45th annual</i>
<i>Miss Boston Barmaid competition.</i>

14:07.809 --> 14:12.020
First, each contestant will tell us
a little bit about herself.

14:13.314 --> 14:15.057
Yvonne?

14:16.900 --> 14:22.273
Hi, I'm Yvonne. I go to modelling
school. I'd like to be an artist.

14:29.993 --> 14:33.196
Hi, I'm Jocelyn.
I like being a waitress.

14:33.329 --> 14:37.457
I'm saving my money to travel
around the world next summer.

14:42.503 --> 14:47.045
Hi, I'm Bonnie. I have to say,
I really like being just what I am,

14:47.174 --> 14:51.005
a cocktail waitress
in the best city in the world.

14:51.969 --> 14:53.677
Boston.

14:58.140 --> 14:59.338
Go!

15:07.731 --> 15:09.770
My name is Diane Chambers

15:09.900 --> 15:13.731
and I would like one day to be known
as the voice of my generation.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.486
You see, I'm a humanist...

15:19.616 --> 15:25.154
Aren't we all? Good luck. lf you win,
we'll be seeing you on <i>AM Boston.</i>

15:25.287 --> 15:26.864
Just let...

15:27.747 --> 15:28.992
<i>AM Boston?</i>

15:29.123 --> 15:33.535
Right. They'll be here later to tape
the announcement of the winner.

15:33.668 --> 15:36.040
Let the games begin!

15:37.421 --> 15:39.662
Diane Chambers, humanist.

15:39.798 --> 15:43.961
Now, Yvonne will wait on the judges,
who'll ask will ask questions

15:44.093 --> 15:46.880
designed to help us
get to know her better.

15:50.890 --> 15:54.305
Hello, there. I'm Yvonne.
I'll be serving you.

15:54.434 --> 15:56.557
What's your pleasure, gentlemen?

15:56.686 --> 16:01.312
Can you recommend something warm,
sweet and perfect for the evening?

16:02.107 --> 16:05.522
Irish coffee... or me.

16:25.917 --> 16:28.159
And one gin and tonic.

16:33.965 --> 16:36.919
I am moved, Cliff.
I'm visibly moved.

16:37.802 --> 16:41.300
- Gonna be tough to beat.
- Now for our last contestant.

16:41.430 --> 16:44.383
From here at Cheers,
Miss Diane Chambers.

16:49.477 --> 16:53.177
Hello. I'm Diane,
I'm delighted to be your waitress.

16:53.314 --> 16:55.887
- What can I get you?
- Screwdriver, please.

16:56.024 --> 16:58.147
- What kind of vodka?
- Absolut.

16:58.276 --> 17:00.268
Absolute-ly

17:04.281 --> 17:07.233
- Chivas rocks.
- I'll have a beer.

17:07.366 --> 17:09.773
- Imported or domestic?
- What do you recommend?

17:09.910 --> 17:14.452
I'll find something nice for you.
Back in a jiff, with pretzels.

17:15.957 --> 17:18.079
You were terrific!

17:18.208 --> 17:22.156
- Wait, you dropped some cards here.
- Never mind.

17:23.087 --> 17:27.380
"Women pitted against each other
in a display of servitude."

17:27.507 --> 17:30.294
I don't know what it means,
but it's making me hot.

17:33.012 --> 17:37.423
- I'll take my speech, thank you.
- What do you mean, speech?

17:37.557 --> 17:41.636
I'm going to win this contest so
I can make a speech denouncing it.

17:41.768 --> 17:45.717
Oh, my God! Is that what
you've been planning the whole time?

17:46.814 --> 17:48.640
Sam, I have to do this.

17:49.524 --> 17:51.682
I don't believe I could be so stupid.

17:51.818 --> 17:55.020
I thought you might be
a regular person for once.

17:55.154 --> 17:59.067
- I am not a regular person.
- You're telling me!

17:59.199 --> 18:04.702
Sam, someday, you will realise
that I am doing the right thing.

18:05.579 --> 18:07.785
Why do you always
have to do the right thing?

18:07.914 --> 18:10.867
Do you see the rest of us doing it?
We're happy.

18:11.834 --> 18:14.917
- May I go now?
- Yeah, go on. Help yourself.

18:15.586 --> 18:19.797
By the way, just want to say, I'm
glad that under all this pressure,

18:19.923 --> 18:22.627
we haven't seen
that facial tic of yours.

18:23.384 --> 18:26.384
And you won't. Mind over matter.

18:29.556 --> 18:31.382
St Pauli Girl.

18:32.892 --> 18:35.050
Absolut screwdriver,

18:35.227 --> 18:38.476
Chivas rocks and pretzels.

18:39.230 --> 18:42.017
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

18:42.149 --> 18:44.355
Is there something wrong, miss?

18:44.484 --> 18:47.484
- What do you mean?
- Are you alright?

18:52.324 --> 18:55.941
Well, I have this... facial tic.

19:00.663 --> 19:05.573
But I... I believe that all of us
have obstacles to overcome in life.

19:05.709 --> 19:09.658
And in the final analysis,
the true measure of greatness

19:09.796 --> 19:13.923
is the severity of obstacles
one has had to overcome

19:14.049 --> 19:16.124
in order to achieve one's goals.

19:17.093 --> 19:18.717
I...

19:20.012 --> 19:24.424
I may not be the most attractive
waitress here, or the most talented,

19:24.557 --> 19:29.135
but I am a survivor.
I didn't come here to lose.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.467
I came here to win.

19:30.603 --> 19:34.137
I will beat them all.
I will beat any who come against me.

19:34.273 --> 19:38.733
As God as my witness,
I will never be hungry again!

19:50.244 --> 19:54.288
Ladies and gentlemen,
this year's Miss Boston Barmaid,

19:54.414 --> 19:56.655
Miss Diane Chambers!

20:01.920 --> 20:04.161
Congratulations, Diane!

20:06.298 --> 20:08.670
- Is that <i>AM Boston?</i>
- Yes, it is.

20:11.093 --> 20:14.509
I really didn't expect
to win this contest. It has...

20:14.638 --> 20:18.255
Thank you. It has been quite...

20:20.684 --> 20:22.723
It has been quite an experience.

20:22.853 --> 20:26.600
Now, I would like to tell you
my feelings about this contest.

20:26.731 --> 20:29.303
But first, let me tell you
what you've won.

20:29.441 --> 20:33.141
- That's not necessary.
- Something every waitress needs.

20:33.277 --> 20:37.820
Six months' worth of free
dry cleaning at Ritz Cleaners!

20:37.948 --> 20:39.406
Thank you.

20:40.783 --> 20:43.356
Contests such as these do nothing...

20:43.494 --> 20:48.155
And for entertaining at home,
a Kitchen Helper food processor.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.155
That's nice. I've always wanted one.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.747
Ladies and gentlemen...

20:57.880 --> 21:01.295
A $200 gift certificate
from Filene's Department Store,

21:01.424 --> 21:05.421
where you can buy some new outfits
for that week-long vacation

21:05.553 --> 21:09.419
you and a friend
will be taking to Bermuda!

21:09.556 --> 21:11.714
Bermuda!

21:11.849 --> 21:13.640
Oh, my God!

21:34.075 --> 21:36.114
I sold out womankind

21:36.243 --> 21:39.030
for a trip to Bermuda.

21:39.788 --> 21:44.247
Don't feel so bad. Most people
would do it for the dry cleaning.

21:47.752 --> 21:49.246
Come on.

21:49.921 --> 21:52.376
I don't even think you did sell out.

21:55.300 --> 22:00.008
- Of course I did.
- No, you let your feelings out.

22:00.137 --> 22:04.086
For the first time in your life,
you were spontaneous. It was great!

22:04.432 --> 22:09.426
It's not the first time I've been
spontaneous. May I have my purse?

22:12.021 --> 22:15.804
I enjoy being spontaneous,
every now and then.

22:17.025 --> 22:19.516
Whenever I think it's appropriate.

22:19.986 --> 22:21.563
You're a maniac.

22:25.490 --> 22:27.198
OK.

22:29.118 --> 22:33.031
Maybe I do tend to be
a little uptight at times.

22:33.163 --> 22:35.369
Maybe this bar is changing me.

22:35.498 --> 22:38.451
Maybe the atmosphere
is rubbing off a little.

22:38.584 --> 22:39.864
Maybe.

22:42.670 --> 22:46.370
And maybe, in some small way,
I'm the better for it.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.674
Maybe you are.

22:51.427 --> 22:53.087
Maybe I should thank you.

22:53.220 --> 22:55.426
Maybe you should.

22:57.098 --> 22:58.177
Like how?

23:00.309 --> 23:01.933
Forget it.

23:04.562 --> 23:07.563
Come on, you really want
to make it up to me?

23:07.690 --> 23:10.773
Let's go to Bermuda.
You got two tickets.

23:11.693 --> 23:13.602
Don't be coy.

23:13.736 --> 23:16.820
Alright, I know I've made
a lot of passes at you.

23:16.947 --> 23:20.113
But take me to Bermuda,
I'll be the perfect gentleman.

23:24.578 --> 23:26.451
- You will?
- Cross my heart.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.622
Then forget it.
