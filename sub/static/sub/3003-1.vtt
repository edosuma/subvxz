- Yes.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.412
Okay.

00:46.413 --> 00:49.415
Leave a message for
Irving Zisman at the...

00:49.416 --> 00:51.984
You fucking mutt, you're
fixing the penguin, dude.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.619
I don't give a fuck
how old you are.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.959
You come to Krazy Fish,
and I will fuck you up.

01:48.475 --> 01:51.918
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville,
welcome to Jackass.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.821
It didn't go.

01:57.484 --> 02:01.787
Irving Zisman was created in
2001 for the Jackass TV series.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.357
It was Spike who introduced us
to makeup artist Tony Gardner.

02:05.358 --> 02:08.526
So, Spike originally
contacted me saying,

02:08.527 --> 02:11.463
we want to take
himself and Knoxville

02:11.464 --> 02:13.610
and turn them into old guys.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.568
I met Tony Gardner 'cause
I did Three Kings.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.505
We actually knew somebody that
knew what they were doing.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.174
And we got really
professional makeup

02:22.175 --> 02:25.322
for our very
unprofessional production.

02:33.186 --> 02:37.389
We started on the
TV show and, yeah,

02:37.390 --> 02:41.094
we would just get old and
go to Glendale, basically.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.330
The funniest shit, though, it
always ended up being like,

02:45.331 --> 02:47.599
"All right, go play golf.
That's not working. Fall down."

02:47.600 --> 02:48.778
Yeah.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.178
The falling down was
what got the reaction.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.884
Oh, my God. Irving!

02:56.943 --> 03:00.590
The makeup has evolved so much.
If you look at the early days,

03:01.247 --> 03:03.549
it used to be almost like a
mask that they'd put on.

03:03.550 --> 03:07.653
It was like a whole hood
piece, and then facial pieces.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.054
And it was thick,

03:09.055 --> 03:11.428
and the way we put the mask on,

03:12.058 --> 03:14.893
it didn't really react with
your face that well.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.496
You look at our first
version of Irving,

03:17.497 --> 03:19.998
and then our second version of Irving,
then our third version of Irving,

03:19.999 --> 03:22.267
the makeup keeps
getting better and better.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.881
And it has to be better. I mean, like,
we could not have done this movie

03:26.339 --> 03:28.540
with the first incarnation
of Irving, you know?

03:28.541 --> 03:32.844
Now it's all individual little
pieces, so each little thing moves.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.180
His throat moves, his cheeks move,

03:35.181 --> 03:38.055
you know, his eyebrows and
everything has expressions.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.619
For a show like this,
definitely you want something

03:40.620 --> 03:43.460
that people, face-to-face,
are gonna believe is skin.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.134
What we would do is
start with the bald cap

03:46.392 --> 03:48.527
and flatten down his eyebrows,

03:48.528 --> 03:51.930
put on the nose, and then work
our way into the larger pieces.

03:51.931 --> 03:56.671
And then eventually finish with
the paint job and the hair work.

03:57.237 --> 04:02.241
They're real artists,
you know, they're amazing.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.077
I was nose-to-nose with
people, pranking them,

04:05.078 --> 04:08.555
and no one ever questioned
the makeup ever.

04:08.881 --> 04:14.186
And Stephen Prouty and all the
guys did such an amazing job,

04:14.187 --> 04:17.391
we got nominated for
an Academy Award.

04:32.071 --> 04:36.686
The golf course was the first
thing we shot for Bad Grandpa.

04:38.311 --> 04:41.958
I was so mad sitting in the
makeup chair that morning,

04:42.015 --> 04:45.284
'cause I was still in my "I'm
pissed about makeup" mood.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.720
"God, 59 more days of this."

04:48.721 --> 04:51.094
That's what I was
thinking that first day.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.296
- Got the right idea.
- Go ahead, go in.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.464
Oh, my goodness!
That's... That's...

04:59.465 --> 05:00.643
Fore!

05:01.701 --> 05:03.141
That's a utility cad.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.637
The golf course gave
us the best idea.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.639
They said, "You know what
would really bug people is,

05:07.640 --> 05:11.076
"when they're on the green,
go and move the hole."

05:11.077 --> 05:13.345
- Oh, come on.
- Get off there, you dumb...

05:13.346 --> 05:15.253
Get out of there!

05:15.682 --> 05:18.226
Who the hell are you, anyway?

05:18.518 --> 05:20.391
Oh, man.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.893
Where you going?

05:27.894 --> 05:29.175
Where you puttin' the hole?

05:31.964 --> 05:33.142
You can't do that.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.835
You can't change a hole right in the
middle of your playing, can he?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.174
Well he just did.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.376
Stand there and watch him.

05:44.377 --> 05:48.714
Alrighty, got you a brand-new
one right here, fellas.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.394
Well, we already hit though.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.418
You guys don't play by the rules?

05:53.419 --> 05:54.486
No, we do.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.030
Well, it doesn't look like it.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.622
The rules are
we gotta play from the hole...

05:57.623 --> 05:59.894
- Fat bastard.
- Pardon me?

06:00.059 --> 06:02.327
You changed the fucking hole
right after we hit.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.830
Hey, Sammy Davis, I don't need
to hear anything from you.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.465
Hey, you can kiss my
ass, motherfucker.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.200
You kiss my ass.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.868
You don't want none of this.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.514
You want a little of this?

06:11.537 --> 06:13.405
You want a little of this?

06:13.406 --> 06:15.017
No, no, no.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.309
I'm just kidding, guys.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.955
Yeah, kidding, my ass.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.579
- What'd you say to me?
- We got, we gotta play the same.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.748
We got nine groups that
gotta play the same hole.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.860
Well, it ain't my problem.

06:28.421 --> 06:29.656
Assholes.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.723
You keep it up, motherfucker.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.358
You keep...
What, what's gonna happen?

06:33.359 --> 06:35.627
- I'll kick your ass if I come near you.
- Oh, yeah? What...

06:35.628 --> 06:37.295
Pick on somebody your own size,

06:37.296 --> 06:39.097
- and your own age.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.966
- How old are you? How old are you?
- Mature.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.135
I'm older than your mother.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.569
You kiss my ass.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.471
I'm 86 years young.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.208
You wanna see 87?

06:48.608 --> 06:51.343
That's funny. I don't
know if I'd open with it,

06:51.344 --> 06:53.114
but that's funny.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.850
Get outta there! Let us
finish the hole, you asshole.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.986
Look it, he knocked your ball away.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.188
Irving was definitely being a dick.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.423
He was trying to get punched.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.571
I think, on the first day
he wanted a good beatdown.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.594
You guys I like. They're pricks.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.530
It doesn't make a difference
who you like.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.565
It matters who I like.
I have feelings.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.367
- You're gonna be fired.
- Don't deny me my feelings.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.701
You're gonna be fired anyway, man.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.171
- Fired, hell...
- Hell, you're not.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.872
Who are you gonna tattle to?

07:20.873 --> 07:22.174
- Whoever it takes.
- Whoever will listen.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.309
- Oh, yeah? Tattletale.
- Yeah!

07:24.310 --> 07:26.046
Well, that's right.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.513
Early on in the movie,
especially the first trip,

07:28.514 --> 07:30.682
Irving hadn't settled into

07:30.683 --> 07:34.586
the lovable old poonhound
that he ended up being.

07:34.587 --> 07:40.533
He was kind of the dour old
poonhound in the beginning.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.033
He was a little tonally off.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.263
They shouldn't have got
so damn excited.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.466
- Gee-whiz, I don't know what the hell.
- Yeah.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.267
You know, we're just here
to have fun and, yeah.

07:49.268 --> 07:53.211
I know, yeah, I'm sorry this
has affected you personally.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.807
- My wife, she's been sick.
- He's wacko.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.076
She won't give me anal anymore.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.446
Sure, hey, I've been through
a lot of shit in my life.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.582
- I'm 82 years old.
- Let's go, John. Next hole.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.585
- God bless you, John.
- Working in construction, man.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.620
We can't hold this up anymore.
They're gonna have the food

08:08.621 --> 08:10.622
and we're not gonna
be there. Let's go.

08:10.623 --> 08:11.923
- All right.
- All right, John.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.125
- You take care of yourself.
- Okay, you, too.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.427
All right.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.996
- And I hope your wife turns out better.
- Thank you. You're a good man.

08:17.997 --> 08:22.475
I'm going to think about overreacting
from now on, so I appreciate it.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.738
Hey, tubby, lay off of it, huh?
I'm talking to John.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.875
John's gotta go,
he's got a meeting.

08:29.876 --> 08:33.751
Well, hell. Bye, John.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.385
Now, don't mistake my
kindness for weakness!

08:40.820 --> 08:42.727
You son of a...

08:44.590 --> 08:46.133
Trouble.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.330
We shot all daylong,

08:52.331 --> 08:54.933
and we had those people
on the hook all day long.

08:54.934 --> 08:57.202
And I think that's
what got me excited.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.270
I'm good, I'm good.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.973
Whose clubs are these?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.976
I think they're with your group.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.144
I took one of their carts.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.746
I'm so sorry.

09:07.747 --> 09:11.082
If we can keep 50 people
on the hook all daylong,

09:11.083 --> 09:13.229
then we can do this.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.931
I think it was a great first day.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.622
Really great.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.492
How does it feel being,
bringing Irving back?

09:20.493 --> 09:23.261
Well, at 4:00 am this morning,
not so good.

09:23.262 --> 09:25.442
But now I feel much better.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.032
So, day one a success.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.700
Day one a success.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.968
How many more days to go?

09:29.969 --> 09:33.048
Only 59 more fucking days.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.353
All right.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.994
Hey, can I bum a
smoke from you, man?

09:52.992 --> 09:54.500
Please?

09:55.161 --> 09:56.761
- Here you go.
- Thank you. What...

09:56.762 --> 09:57.963
Don't worry about it.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.302
Why would you put
that in your body?

10:02.335 --> 10:04.708
Why would you do that to yourself?

10:05.771 --> 10:08.807
You're a big, strong man.
Why would you smoke?

10:08.808 --> 10:10.208
Bro, I'm gonna go in here

10:10.209 --> 10:12.410
- Wait, this, this gonna...
- Huh? What are you doing?

10:12.411 --> 10:15.013
I'm gonna go in here before I
beat your motherfucking ass.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.115
Oh, yeah? You think...
You do a lot of talk,

10:17.116 --> 10:19.125
just 'cause I'm old.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.552
I used to box!

10:20.553 --> 10:23.757
I almost got my ass beat
by those two guys.

10:23.956 --> 10:28.195
They went inside and thought about
me stomping out their cigarette

10:28.661 --> 10:31.663
and came back out with
a cigar, like, this long,

10:31.664 --> 10:35.967
and just put it right in my face,
begging that I would take it.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.936
You're smoking again?

10:37.937 --> 10:41.016
Now you're smoking cigars.
God damn it.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.541
How much money
you got in your pocket?

10:43.542 --> 10:45.278
How much money?

10:45.878 --> 10:48.115
I got a lot.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.761
Why, you wanna make
a bet on something?

10:54.720 --> 10:56.988
I'm looking for that money
you broke my cigarette for.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.256
The cigarette you smashed.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.334
No, no, no. That was
a favor for you.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.229
You say you were
gonna whoop my ass?

11:02.428 --> 11:04.596
You're talking, you were talking.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.697
Didn't you say
you was gonna whoop my ass?

11:05.698 --> 11:06.765
Yeah, yeah.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.433
You not gonna let me show you,
you ready?

11:08.434 --> 11:09.534
You ready?

11:09.535 --> 11:10.602
I'm always ready.

11:10.603 --> 11:11.803
Well what you waiting on?

11:12.605 --> 11:13.977
Well...

11:14.440 --> 11:18.315
I'm a little down on my back
right now. Otherwise, I would.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.681
Who is this guy, man?

11:20.746 --> 11:21.846
Who is this guy, man?

11:21.847 --> 11:22.981
Come on, come on.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.560
Did you see that fucking
hot chick who walked by?

11:25.818 --> 11:26.885
Fuck that chick,

11:26.886 --> 11:28.720
where my motherfucking
cigarette money at, partner?

11:28.721 --> 11:30.555
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about chicks,

11:30.556 --> 11:32.565
you're talking about cigarettes.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.702
We got a whole different
way of looking at things.

11:36.162 --> 11:39.464
I bet you won't knock that I bet you
won't knock that cigar out of his hand.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.599
See, he's trying to start fights.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.836
- No, no.
- Yes, yes, you are.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.381
Which I like. I like that.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.040
- You're a shit-starter.
- No, I'm just saying...

11:49.041 --> 11:50.508
You're a shit-starter, I like that.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.210
But you smashed his cigarette, man!

11:52.211 --> 11:55.153
I was doing... He's a handsome
man, why would he smoke?

11:59.919 --> 12:02.821
He was nice enough to give you a cigarette,
and you stepped on it and smashed it!

12:02.822 --> 12:04.968
And I wanted to do him a favor.

12:05.825 --> 12:09.131
Jeez Louise. Now I'm the bad guy.

12:10.963 --> 12:15.800
Sitters was a form of mark that
we would use pretty frequently,

12:15.801 --> 12:17.869
'cause it would just be like,

12:17.870 --> 12:21.017
if we wanted someone to be
sod of a captive audience,

12:21.607 --> 12:24.242
you know, I could find
somebody where it's like,

12:24.243 --> 12:28.482
"Hey, my grandpa just sits at this
fountain. I know he's so lonely.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.415
"Could I have you just, like,

12:30.416 --> 12:33.818
"go up and act like
you weren't hired by me

12:33.819 --> 12:35.086
"to go just talk with him,

12:35.087 --> 12:37.622
"and just sit and talk with him
for, like, an hour or something?"

12:37.623 --> 12:38.890
Well, hello, good-looking.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.692
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.760
Good.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.162
I lucked out getting the only dry
bench in the park, it seems.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.930
Right, you did, you really did.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.800
If we hired a babysitter
to babysit Irving,

12:48.801 --> 12:52.270
I could talk to that person as long
as I want and say whatever I wanted,

12:52.271 --> 12:54.172
'cause they had to be there,
they were paid.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.341
- I'm no different than any other man...
- Right.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.077
With two arms, two legs
and 14-inch balls.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.378
Right, right, right.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.114
Throaty smell. Like, a deeper...

13:03.115 --> 13:05.352
I'd like to hog-wrench
that spatouli.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.587
I should be eating at the
nappy kitchen every night.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.699
I mean, you're exactly right.

13:11.824 --> 13:16.060
But the problem with the babysitters
was you kinda got this sort of stilted,

13:16.061 --> 13:19.464
these people felt unnaturally
staying there.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.833
They weren't giving
big enough reactions,

13:21.834 --> 13:23.668
'cause they were
sod of unnaturally there.

13:23.669 --> 13:27.339
I was the Robin Hood of poontang.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.477
Friar Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:33.679 --> 13:37.916
But we did do some funny
things with the babysitters.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.385
We thought, while I'm getting out
story points about the movie

13:40.386 --> 13:42.554
with this babysitter,

13:42.555 --> 13:46.958
how about if we have
Charlie run by.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.695
Charlie's our stunt coordinator.

13:49.195 --> 13:53.138
And he's playing an actor,
she doesn't know him, I do,

13:53.465 --> 13:55.567
and I challenged him to a footrace,

13:55.568 --> 13:59.237
and in the midst of the
footrace, I trip him

13:59.238 --> 14:00.772
and steal his wallet.

14:00.773 --> 14:05.443
And she has to help me conceal
that I had stolen the wallet

14:05.444 --> 14:08.090
from him and anybody else.

14:09.615 --> 14:10.949
You shouldn't have tripped him.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.653
- Why did you trip him?
- Look at this. I got his wallet.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.787
- No, you didn't.
- I got his wallet.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.626
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah.

14:18.157 --> 14:21.192
- No, you did not steal his wallet.
- Yes, I got it. Yeah.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.395
You have to give it back to him.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.964
- No way.
- Why not?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.473
We need money for the road.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.608
- You gotta give that back to him.
- Oh, shit. He's here, be cool.

14:31.637 --> 14:32.837
So...

14:32.838 --> 14:35.644
- You guys didn't see a wallet, did you?
- Nope.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.881
How can you do that?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.283
How can you have that
on your conscience?

14:45.284 --> 14:47.259
It's not on my conscience.

14:47.286 --> 14:51.298
You know, I mean, really.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.692
- Look.
- Do you know how valuable that is?

14:54.693 --> 14:56.372
It's just 90 bucks.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.029
How could you do that?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.664
See, now you're making
me feel guilty.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.869
You should. You should feel guilty.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.306
I'll just go... Let me look.

15:06.939 --> 15:10.208
Hey, we found it over
there in the bush.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.777
You wanna keep going? Where?

15:12.778 --> 15:14.719
It was right over
there in that bush.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.857
There you go, buddy.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.193
He walked over there
and looked for it.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.331
Have a good day, son.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.794
- Way to cover, way to cover.
- I'm not, I'm not...

15:29.795 --> 15:31.629
- I'm upset.
- Come on, don't leave me hanging.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.831
- I'm upset.
- Look, look, look, we still got the money.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.012
Oh, you're a good girl.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.939
No, I'm not, I'm not.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.238
- Just be cool.
- Where's the money?

15:40.239 --> 15:41.572
- Huh?
- No. No.

15:41.573 --> 15:42.907
- Where's the money?
- I don't have the money.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.143
Who has the money?

15:44.310 --> 15:46.477
She's got it. She took it.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.546
- No, I don't have your money.
- It's right there.

15:48.547 --> 15:51.227
- I don't have the money, though.
- Where's it at? There it is.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.052
He, you know what,
he put your money here.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.789
- Oh, really?
- He did.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.722
You know, I should call
the cops on you guys,

15:57.723 --> 15:58.823
- is what I should do.
- You could.

15:58.824 --> 16:02.471
- I didn't have nothing to do with this.
- Will you just let her...

16:03.896 --> 16:06.764
She rarely has ever
done this, so...

16:06.765 --> 16:08.366
I'll tell you what, you should
be ashamed of yourself,

16:08.367 --> 16:09.534
- is what you should be.
- Yeah.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.069
I didn't do it, she did it!

16:11.070 --> 16:12.943
I don't care who
did it. Both of you.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.072
I did not.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.107
- Well, obviously you had the money.
- Keep walking, bird legs.

16:16.108 --> 16:18.810
This isn't good. I think
I'd better start walking.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.745
You seem like a nice guy.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.425
Oh, shit.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.683
- What?
- All right. We should split up.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.919
- Why?
- 'Cause there's a cop.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.887
- You see the cop?
- Yeah.

16:29.888 --> 16:32.068
Remember, you didn't see nothing.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.666
Oh, shit.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.955
Hi, idiot.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.850
Hi, asshole.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.685
Hi, idiot. Hi, idiot.

17:00.686 --> 17:05.061
- Don't call Grandpa an idiot.
- Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, idiot.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.936
Might get this for Gloria.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.032
It's about her size.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.136
You should get one of
these for Mrs. Claus.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.270
And what is that?

17:19.271 --> 17:21.973
- Maybe Donner and Blitzen, too.
- Okay.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.411
I bet they would ruin it.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.079
- Hey, Billy, you wanna see Santa?
- Hello. Look.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.147
Yeah.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.249
Hey, Billy, before you go over,

17:31.250 --> 17:33.184
ask Santa for something
for Grandpa.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.318
I have to go pee-pee.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.821
Okay, well, wait to use the restroom
until after we do it, all right?

17:36.822 --> 17:38.228
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.369
- What's that?
- Just ask him.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.663
Hi, Billy.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.565
- Hi, Santa Claus.
- How old are you, buddy?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.767
- Good.
- How old are you?

17:49.768 --> 17:50.868
Eight.

17:50.869 --> 17:53.471
Are you eight years old now?
Gosh, you're getting so tall.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.239
- He's a big boy.
- Yeah.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.476
Look right up there, Billy, and
take your hands out and say,

17:58.477 --> 17:59.844
"Cheeseburger."

17:59.845 --> 18:01.922
- Cheeseburger.
- Cheeseburger.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.016
Now, what do you want
for Christmas, Billy?

18:05.017 --> 18:07.852
I want a fishing rod,
tackle and bait.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.120
Okay.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.302
- My mom to get out of jail.
- Okay.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.226
And a rusty trombone
for my grandpa.

18:15.227 --> 18:18.296
- A rusty trombone for your grandpa?
- Yep.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.306
- I'm cold.
- You are?

18:20.599 --> 18:24.076
How can you be cold? Do you think
I'm giving you the shivers?

18:25.170 --> 18:29.207
Santa gives a lot of kids the shivers
'cause I come from the North Pole.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.568
Hope that's all he gives him.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.811
But anyway, Billy, do you know

18:33.812 --> 18:37.248
what snowmen eat for breakfast?

18:37.249 --> 18:39.588
- What?
- Frosted Flakes.

18:42.688 --> 18:46.461
Do you know why Santa Claus
doesn't have any children?

18:49.027 --> 18:52.834
He only comes once a year,
and it's down a chimney.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.842
All right, you be a good boy, okay?

18:57.302 --> 19:00.771
Grandpa, I think I pissed myself.

19:00.772 --> 19:01.906
You did?

19:01.907 --> 19:05.714
You didn't think you
did, you really peed.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.346
- Sorry, Santa.
- That's okay, buddy.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.714
- Sorry.
- You be good, okay?

19:09.715 --> 19:11.449
- Jesus.
- Sorry about the pee-pee.

19:11.450 --> 19:14.722
- That's okay, buddy. No harm done.
- Oh, no. What'd you do?

19:16.221 --> 19:18.298
Okay, we're gonna
have to take a break.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.639
- How you doing?
- Hello, how are you?

19:34.640 --> 19:35.910
Good.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.845
Oh, no. My colostomy bag.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.322
No, don't touch it, don't touch.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.598
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, God, that...

19:57.262 --> 19:59.100
I'm very sorry.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.602
Oh, no, I dropped my watch.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.176
I dropped my watch.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.207
- In there?
- Yes. Can you help me?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.975
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.910
Is there some staff around?

20:12.911 --> 20:15.182
- Yeah, he just went to get help.
- Okay.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.215
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.116
If you stand in there,
he's gonna get help.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.785
Okay. Thank you.

20:20.786 --> 20:23.398
- Because they'll go get you...
- Can you help me?

20:23.689 --> 20:25.723
- They're gonna get your stuff out.
- You're a good boy.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.426
You're fine.

20:36.768 --> 20:39.270
When you're doing pranks,
every now and then

20:39.271 --> 20:42.173
you'll come across someone
who's absolute gold,

20:42.174 --> 20:44.175
and that was the penguin guy.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.211
- You ran over the penguin.
- You put a penguin in my spot.

20:47.212 --> 20:50.723
You ran over the penguin,
what are you talking about?

20:50.816 --> 20:52.516
Well, you don't have to yell at me.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.518
We cut the bit to two
and a half minutes,

20:54.519 --> 20:57.962
but it could have
easily been 15 minutes.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.691
He just kept generating footage.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.660
You're fixing this
fucking penguin, dude.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.428
- Nah.
- What happened to it?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.030
He put it right in my spot!

21:06.031 --> 21:07.898
What do you mean your spot?
You ran it over!

21:07.899 --> 21:09.000
Well, you don't have to yell.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.568
You ran the fucking penguin over,

21:10.569 --> 21:12.578
- you fucking mutt.
- You're still yelling.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.372
Jesus Christ.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.973
Do you work at this restaurant?

21:15.974 --> 21:17.475
Don't worry about
where I work at, dude.

21:17.476 --> 21:20.111
You know, you work at Fish
City across town, you said.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.579
- Krazy Fish.
- Krazy Fish.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.047
Krazy Fish, get that
right, Krazy Fish.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.282
- Krazy Fish.
- With a K.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.984
And if you did that to my fucking place
I would whip your goddamn ass, dude.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.220
With a K? Sounds exotic.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.187
So, George didn't even
work at that restaurant,

21:30.188 --> 21:32.657
he worked at somewhere across town,

21:32.658 --> 21:37.695
which he kept kind of half-promoting
while he was yelling at me.

21:37.696 --> 21:40.364
Bro, come up to my fucking
restaurant right now, Krazy Fish.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.133
- You come up there right now.
- Krazy Fish with a K?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.534
Yeah, right up the
street over here, man.

21:43.535 --> 21:46.875
I'll meet you over there, then I'll whip
your fucking ass in the back, dude.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.175
What's your best item on your menu?

21:51.176 --> 21:53.544
Don't worry about what
the best... Called "whip-ass."

21:53.545 --> 21:55.646
- Whip-ass?
- Yeah.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.982
Is that an entrée or a side?

21:57.983 --> 22:00.254
It's gonna be fucking both.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.525
They good prices? I like value.

22:02.554 --> 22:05.056
You're gonna fix
this fucking penguin, dude.

22:05.057 --> 22:08.125
He ain't leaving, dude, until he
fixes this fucking penguin, dude.

22:08.126 --> 22:09.226
I'm sorry.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.529
- He's hyper-focused on the penguin.
- I ain't fucking...

22:11.530 --> 22:14.532
Listen, old man, you shouldn't
be driving to begin with!

22:14.533 --> 22:16.600
If Irving was driving
and hit something,

22:16.601 --> 22:19.337
the lawyers wouldn't allow
Billy to be in there,

22:19.338 --> 22:22.807
so we had a dummy in his place.

22:22.808 --> 22:26.477
And at one point, George finds it.

22:26.478 --> 22:29.158
Yeah, I'm taking this
guy out of the car.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.152
And I don't know what
he's thinking at that point.

22:35.153 --> 22:39.390
It had to look like this weird little sex
toy or something for this dirty grandpa.

22:39.391 --> 22:42.426
Here you go. That's your
fucking partner in crime.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.762
- That's your leverage?
- All right, you fucking mutt.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.284
You're fixing this penguin, dude.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.366
You're fixing that penguin, dude.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.343
Fix the fucking
thing, dude. Fix it.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.148
Fix it.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.181
Dude, you and I
are gonna go to town, bro.

22:56.241 --> 22:58.709
And in his defense, you know,

22:58.710 --> 23:01.946
I yelled at him early on,
and it got him emotional.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.781
And then he became irrational.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.684
And when people become irrational,

23:06.685 --> 23:10.355
everything is real
to them, you know?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.690
They're completely on the hook.

23:12.691 --> 23:15.893
All over this stupid penguin.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.507
Dude, fucking leave
the penguin alone, bro.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.768
Anybody know this fucking guy?

23:23.769 --> 23:26.313
"Anybody know this fucking guy?"

23:26.471 --> 23:27.571
You're a fucking...

23:27.572 --> 23:29.979
"He's on my nerves two,
three times already."

23:30.542 --> 23:32.688
Go fuck yourself.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.028
This motherfucker.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.633
Fuck. There you go.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.528
You kind of throw like a girl.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.766
I'm gonna fucking
throw you in a second.

23:56.401 --> 23:59.069
Atomic elbow! Atomic elbow.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.138
I did a little wrestling
myself in my younger days.

24:01.139 --> 24:04.252
- Dude, are you fucking kidding me, bro?
- What? Atomic elbow?

24:05.143 --> 24:08.756
I'm gonna whip your ass with your
own motherfucking doll, dude.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.016
- Come on. My tuchus.
- I'm telling you, dude.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.784
- Do me again, do me again.
- Fix the fucking thing.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.686
- Get me again.
- Dude, I'm gonna whip your ass, bro.

24:15.687 --> 24:19.190
With eye contact, with eye
contact, get me again. Come on.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.325
Does anybody know this fucking guy?
You guys know him?

24:21.326 --> 24:23.093
With eye contact, get me again.

24:23.094 --> 24:24.671
I think I've seen him somewhere.

24:26.097 --> 24:28.365
- You fucking piece of shit.
- Oh, come on.

24:28.366 --> 24:31.302
He was really on the
hook, and that is...

24:31.303 --> 24:33.070
That's about as fun
as it gets for me.

24:33.071 --> 24:36.106
And he was also,
he had a nice sense of humor

24:36.107 --> 24:37.441
about it when it was over.

24:37.442 --> 24:39.343
How come you didn't take a swing?

24:39.344 --> 24:41.011
'Cause he's a fucking
old man, dude.

24:41.012 --> 24:43.047
I was fucking waiting for
the cops or something,

24:43.048 --> 24:45.783
I was gonna fuck him up,
dude. I can't believe that.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.622
Here, what do I gotta sign, man?

24:49.054 --> 24:51.789
So, we first shot Irving's
balls on Jackass Number Two,

24:51.790 --> 24:54.892
and Johnny Knoxville loves having
those prosthetic balls on.

24:54.893 --> 24:58.905
So, as we were writing ideas, we knew
we were gonna bring back the balls.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.800
You have the balls
readily available?

25:02.801 --> 25:04.562
- Not here.
- That's the set of hangers.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.875
But Knoxville specifically
wanted two sets made.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.643
He wanted the more-believable,

25:12.644 --> 25:15.552
which I think are the
12-inch hanging balls.

25:18.950 --> 25:22.353
But then he thought it'd be
hilarious to shoot a bit where

25:22.354 --> 25:25.990
his balls are actually tucked into his
black socks that are pulled up real high.

25:25.991 --> 25:29.604
So, he had to make an 18-inch
dangling set of balls.

25:30.428 --> 25:34.474
So, we thought it'd be funny to
prank a bunch of delivery guys.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.401
- Hello.
- How are you, son?

25:37.402 --> 25:39.639
- How are you doing, sir?
- Good, good.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.443
What have we got?

25:43.608 --> 25:46.176
- This one.
- All right. Thank you.

25:46.177 --> 25:48.755
- Sure. This one.
- Yes, sir.

25:48.813 --> 25:51.152
It's never as simple as it appears.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.518
I answer the door in my boxers,
my balls are tucked in the sock,

25:54.519 --> 25:57.321
you'd think they would see it,
but sometimes they don't see it,

25:57.322 --> 26:01.368
and so we have to figure out a way
to get their eyes down there.

26:02.527 --> 26:03.694
Jesus.

26:03.695 --> 26:06.375
- That was just plates.
- Okay.

26:06.998 --> 26:09.400
I'm sorry, can you get that
for me, son, I can't really...

26:09.401 --> 26:11.877
Of course, of course. No problem.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.844
$73.97, sir.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.213
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.682
- All right. There you go, son.
- Thank you so much.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.951
- Keep the change. All right, all right.
- I appreciate it, thank you.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.218
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

26:28.219 --> 26:30.262
- Have a good night, sir.
- You, too.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.924
I didn't tip him for shit.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.196
Did he see? Did he look?

26:36.294 --> 26:40.831
It was one of those days where
we'd never done a prank before,

26:40.832 --> 26:43.842
and we executed it like shit.

26:45.203 --> 26:48.472
We called the same delivery
place over and over,

26:48.473 --> 26:50.274
having them send drivers over.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.842
Yeah, all right.

26:51.843 --> 26:54.580
Of course word's gonna get out
amongst the drivers.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.083
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

26:59.084 --> 27:02.490
- Johnny Knoxville, I presume.
- Yes, sir. Good to meet you.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.833
I did a search on the...

27:07.692 --> 27:09.493
We're still not that
good at what we do.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.831
So, we were going to film

27:13.832 --> 27:17.775
this very simple matching
shot of me making a U-turn.

27:17.802 --> 27:22.246
It was the decision for me to go
back and get Billy at the bar.

27:22.273 --> 27:24.241
Windows are up until
we make the U-turn.

27:24.242 --> 27:26.718
Okay, yeah, I'll put
it in the floor.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.347
We had filmed the
exterior of the U-turn,

27:30.348 --> 27:33.384
now we were filming
the interior of the U-turn,

27:33.385 --> 27:36.361
and all I needed to know, Sean,

27:36.755 --> 27:39.492
was, is the window up
or the window down.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.192
When you're filming, this
window has to be up, okay?

27:42.193 --> 27:43.804
- Okay.
- Thanks, bud.

27:44.963 --> 27:50.100
And the best thing is I'm gonna go
shoot a scene where I have to kinda

27:50.101 --> 27:52.803
get a little worked up.
It's an emotional scene.

27:52.804 --> 27:55.964
The director, Jeff Tremaine, comes up
to me right before we shoot and goes,

27:56.074 --> 27:59.343
"Hey, can I stay back

27:59.344 --> 28:02.821
"and color this sign while
you go shoot this?"

28:03.748 --> 28:08.052
I'm like, "Yeah, of course,
Spielberg, you stay back and color,

28:08.053 --> 28:10.754
"I'm gonna go shoot a
dramatic scene. No sweat."

28:10.755 --> 28:14.158
Joe, can you tell me to roll my
window up right before we shoot?

28:14.159 --> 28:18.000
It's too hot in here
to keep it up for now.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.875
Copy that.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.367
Joe, remember the only time
that has to be down is

28:23.368 --> 28:25.946
when he actually pulls
the actual U-turn.

28:26.905 --> 28:31.485
I was so confused
what the hell was going on.

28:31.576 --> 28:33.444
You know I wasn't there for that.
That's not my fault.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.746
I mean, that was,
that was Trip and Joe.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.114
Did he really blame me for that?

28:37.115 --> 28:39.727
He blamed me for the
window up, window down?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.956
Trip, you said the only time
the window has to be down

28:45.957 --> 28:47.864
is when I make the U-turn?

28:48.093 --> 28:51.399
You make the U-turn is when you make
the U-turn. Other than that it's up.

28:52.363 --> 28:54.042
PJ, the whole time it's up

28:54.232 --> 28:56.300
For continuity,
the only time after you come

28:56.301 --> 28:58.135
out of the montage
the window is down

28:58.136 --> 29:01.146
is when you pull the actual
U-turn to go back to the bar.

29:04.442 --> 29:07.680
Jennifer and I just went through all
the frame-grabs, and that's how it is.

29:08.179 --> 29:10.985
So I make the U-turn,
then roll my window down?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.918
No, it's the sequence
when you do the U-turn

29:14.919 --> 29:16.996
that's when you have to
roll your window down.

29:17.055 --> 29:18.825
You do it before we
make the U-turn.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.558
So let's get on the main road,
and then we'll keep moving.

29:21.559 --> 29:23.639
Then we'll roll up the window
and start rolling.

29:24.963 --> 29:26.141
Correct.

29:32.237 --> 29:36.214
Don't roll that passenger window down,
PJ, because the camera's attached to it.

29:41.179 --> 29:45.482
I am not following.
Do... Look, is my...

29:45.483 --> 29:48.562
Do I have to touch my window
the whole time?

29:50.021 --> 29:54.567
You do not. Before your window is
down for your comfort right now

29:56.594 --> 29:58.796
your driver side window is up.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.232
Don't even touch it until
we get to the U-turn

30:02.233 --> 30:04.538
and then Joe will come out
and open your window.

30:07.539 --> 30:10.607
I've showed that to people and they
just can't believe it happens.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.219
I'm like, "It happens."

30:12.477 --> 30:14.745
For continuity sake, the only
time your window is down

30:14.746 --> 30:18.587
is when you actually pull
the U-turn in the cut.

30:20.518 --> 30:24.860
All right, so let's bring your window up so
that it's up now and we'll start rolling.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.825
But the longer it
went on, I thought,

30:27.826 --> 30:30.870
"You know what? Maybe
everyone's fucking crazy."

30:31.029 --> 30:34.665
Well, fuck, I still don't
fucking follow, but whatever.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.133
All right, window should be up...

30:36.134 --> 30:39.536
We work some days
at a really high level,

30:39.537 --> 30:43.776
and then other days it's like we've
never seen a camera before in our life.

30:43.908 --> 30:47.681
Dude, hold on one second, I just
want to fix something back there.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.416
Good job, Rick,
that made all the difference.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.185
To make it less daunting, it was
easier just to wrap your head around

30:55.186 --> 30:56.653
"write funny scenarios for Irving."

30:56.654 --> 30:58.959
That's what we always did for
the Jackass movies.

30:59.724 --> 31:02.292
- Rick.
- What?

31:02.293 --> 31:05.599
Put tap dance shoes
on and tap dance.

31:06.397 --> 31:07.598
Stay still.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.399
Can you sit up, please?

31:09.400 --> 31:13.207
Can you adjust the cameras?
Jesus Christ.

31:14.939 --> 31:16.707
Can you hear it?

31:16.708 --> 31:19.821
Then shut the fuck up!
Look at all the shit you've got.

31:20.144 --> 31:22.446
Rick, you're doing great, kid.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.348
You're doing great,
don't change a thing.

31:24.349 --> 31:27.851
He's got two sets of keys
and he's fucking...

31:27.852 --> 31:30.396
All right, all right. Camera hides.

31:30.521 --> 31:34.498
Oh, my gosh. Almost like
they made these boxes for it.

31:35.426 --> 31:37.761
What are you doing right here?

31:37.762 --> 31:39.771
Making camera hides.

31:39.797 --> 31:43.171
On our first trip, we didn't
have it figured out at all.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.747
I thought we had. But no.

31:48.106 --> 31:51.378
Just a prototype but, you
know, it's a starting point.

31:54.779 --> 31:57.481
Well, I remember walking on
the set in... Was it, Columbus?

31:57.482 --> 32:01.926
We were at a cafe,
and we had, like, a camera,

32:02.921 --> 32:08.725
I mean, it wasn't much different
than a camera, like, bag like this

32:08.726 --> 32:11.873
with a hole right there and the
guy just sitting there holding it.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.672
And I was so fucking pissed.

32:16.267 --> 32:21.212
The family sees, saw that camera
with the girl and the bag.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.580
This might be a bust
before it even begins.

32:27.378 --> 32:30.380
You see him looking at the
camera guy and walking away?

32:30.381 --> 32:32.883
After the first trip, we rallied,

32:32.884 --> 32:37.123
and all the things that
were wrong as a production,

32:37.922 --> 32:42.059
we all talked and we fixed them for our
next trip out to Cleveland, I think it was.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.298
So, our camera hides and bags
were much better.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.935
What camera?

32:51.936 --> 32:54.343
So, this is our baby carriage,

32:55.440 --> 32:58.575
since I couldn't be trusted
with a real baby,

32:58.576 --> 33:02.189
I got me one of these instead.

33:02.780 --> 33:06.416
We had birdhouse hides,
and we had a shopping cart,

33:06.417 --> 33:08.460
we had two shopping carts.

33:08.553 --> 33:11.233
There was a helmet that
we shot through.

33:11.522 --> 33:14.925
It's a video camera. Looks
like an old photo camera,

33:14.926 --> 33:16.193
but it's a video camera.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.561
You want to put it
on this end or something?

33:17.562 --> 33:19.696
You never know where the
best reactions are gonna be,

33:19.697 --> 33:21.898
so you really want as many cameras,

33:21.899 --> 33:24.409
kind of making a circle
around the whole location.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.682
I had a button cam on.

33:29.807 --> 33:32.009
We had a Port-A-Potty, and
sometimes people would come up

33:32.010 --> 33:34.778
and try to use it and so the
camera gets wiggled because

33:34.779 --> 33:36.680
someone's trying to
get in there to poop.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.281
We had a funny trash can hide.

33:38.282 --> 33:40.484
It's the most comfortable hide
I've been in yet, actually.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.486
Oh, yeah, and then,
the soda machine.

33:42.487 --> 33:45.756
Looks like a soda machine and there's
a cameraman shooting through it.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.758
That's actually one of
the stars of the movie.

33:48.559 --> 33:53.606
Push, push. Push, push.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

33:53.831 --> 33:56.705
Oh, yeah, I felt sorry for
the cameramen. I really did.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.802
I have a bad problem
with claustrophobia,

33:58.803 --> 34:00.971
so I was really feeling for them.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.073
They're just stuck there
behind their camera

34:03.074 --> 34:08.478
shooting for, I mean, sometimes
it was six, seven hours.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.659
I mean, they had to have a little
pee bottle with them in there.

34:10.782 --> 34:15.954
We never gave them a poo bottle, but
I don't think anyone ever pooped.

34:16.087 --> 34:19.530
Should I take a shit before
or after I go in there?

34:20.091 --> 34:22.726
- We got a little bucket.
- I'll use the bucket.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.860
- Don't use the bucket.
- That's what it's there for.

34:24.862 --> 34:28.098
There's a bucket. There is really
a bucket. Just in case, you know?

34:28.099 --> 34:31.168
But if someone has to use
that, you're screwed.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.402
Most of the time on the street

34:32.402 --> 34:34.838
we'd shoot out of vehicles
with the bigger cameras.

34:34.839 --> 34:37.041
Here's one of our
shooting vehicles.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.545
I would never let Kosick go out, 'cause
I think Kosick's too recognizable,

34:41.545 --> 34:44.991
so he was always stuck in the van with
me, shooting out of a tinted window.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.753
So, I've always got Kosick fading
in the backseat of where I am.

34:48.186 --> 34:51.094
Excuse me? You faded all the time.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.524
I'm telling the story
here, Rick, not you.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.362
Your story is not legit.

34:56.793 --> 34:58.595
- Telling people...
- You faded a lot.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.901
- Bullshit.
- You faded as much as me.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.568
Seamus, explain to me
what's going on here.

35:04.569 --> 35:09.606
It's for the wireless microphones,
so we have better reception.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.980
You get to be far away.

35:12.243 --> 35:14.111
Not only do
we have to hide our cameras,

35:14.112 --> 35:16.313
but we have to hide our mics.

35:16.314 --> 35:20.617
So, Seamus would wrap
his little mics in, you know,

35:20.618 --> 35:22.686
trash or, like, a coffee cup

35:22.687 --> 35:25.789
and just place it where
the action would be.

35:25.790 --> 35:30.096
And we'd constantly have to stop people
from, like, picking up our equipment.

35:31.696 --> 35:34.502
Well, this is where
my wife wanted to be buried.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.533
- Married?
- Buried!

35:36.534 --> 35:38.975
He's trying, he said,
to pick up chicks.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.138
Kept Seamus busy for a while.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.875
I'm a recent widower,

35:45.076 --> 35:48.411
if you weren't married I think
we'd have a pretty good shot.

35:48.412 --> 35:51.148
We had all the cameras
fed to one place,

35:51.149 --> 35:53.116
and that was the control van,

35:53.117 --> 35:58.555
where we had the director, myself,
Trip, just watching everything.

35:58.556 --> 36:00.790
We could see exactly what's
going on from every camera

36:00.791 --> 36:02.993
and make adjustments
as we went along.

36:03.494 --> 36:07.364
So, this is how I talk to Irving.
That's how I talk to Billy.

36:07.365 --> 36:11.069
And I get confused all the time
and I tell them the wrong things.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.571
Where'd Billy go?

36:14.572 --> 36:16.039
He went back to the van.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.641
You wanna go back
around there and reset?

36:17.642 --> 36:18.820
Bullshit.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.845
Yes, but I wasn't talking to you,

36:21.846 --> 36:24.247
I was, like, acting like
I was looking for Billy.

36:24.248 --> 36:25.620
I'm sorry.

36:27.718 --> 36:30.020
As Irving was, kept striking
out through the movie,

36:30.021 --> 36:33.790
we thought it would be funny
to hire these love guru guys,

36:33.791 --> 36:37.594
these pickup artists, you know,
that you can hire these guys

36:37.595 --> 36:39.829
that will give you game, you know.

36:39.830 --> 36:43.102
We thought these guys
have to be great characters.

36:43.334 --> 36:46.879
What do you, what
do you do exactly?

36:47.071 --> 36:48.438
First of all, I like
to work with people.

36:48.439 --> 36:50.307
I'd like to get you to a point
where you feel

36:50.308 --> 36:51.908
comfortable talking to women again.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.077
And then I also work on things
like your fashion.

36:54.078 --> 36:56.112
My fashion? Like
what kind of stuff?

36:56.113 --> 36:58.949
Well, you know, you might
wanna soften it up a bit.

36:58.950 --> 37:02.819
Right now, you look good,
but you're a little outdated.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.554
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little bit.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.755
- Yeah?
- A little bit.

37:05.756 --> 37:08.391
We wanted this guy
to just be this misogynistic,

37:08.392 --> 37:11.528
womanizing prick, basically,

37:11.529 --> 37:15.966
but what we got was
this very sweet, genuine guy.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.735
Like, you must have kicked
Wilt Chamberlain in the ass

37:18.736 --> 37:20.704
sleeping, like, with the
number of women you...

37:20.705 --> 37:23.039
I, you know, I can't say.
I don't know, I never counted.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.975
You're not... No, no, no, yeah.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.210
I always thought
it was disrespectful to count.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.779
I've only counted how
many at one time.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.459
Oh, shit.

37:33.217 --> 37:35.328
Let me hear, let me hear.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.120
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

37:37.121 --> 37:38.391
Seven.

37:41.225 --> 37:45.805
Oh, my God, seven, seven
at once. Seven at once.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.575
He slept with seven women at once.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.202
That's what he just said. He
slept with seven women at once.

37:52.203 --> 37:54.371
- That's not true. It's not.
- That is true.

37:54.372 --> 37:57.109
- Would you stop? Stop.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.487
I don't know if I can do this.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.446
Hey, Bridget. This is Cedric.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.415
- Hi, Bridget, my name's Irving.
- I don't think you should...

38:05.416 --> 38:07.150
- Irving. Hi.
- You're very beautiful.

38:07.151 --> 38:10.520
This is my friend Cedric. He
banged seven women in one night.

38:10.521 --> 38:13.556
- Tonight?
- No, not, not, not tonight.

38:13.557 --> 38:14.691
That's attractive.

38:14.692 --> 38:17.327
But this man has set a record.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.098
I'm going home.

38:19.263 --> 38:23.300
All right, cheers. Cheers,
cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.701
Cheers, fellas!

38:24.702 --> 38:29.706
All right. Here's to seven
women in one night!

38:29.707 --> 38:31.079
Go, Cedric!

38:32.710 --> 38:36.881
If Irving starts drinking,
he gets excited.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.815
I need another shot of tequila!

38:38.816 --> 38:42.018
- No, you don't. No, you don't!
- Yes, I do.

38:42.019 --> 38:45.496
But it's good when Irving
drinks, because sometimes,

38:46.424 --> 38:48.325
you know, I get a
little more loose.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.660
- Cedric.
- Yes, sir.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.671
I will throw myself on the
grenade, which one's the grenade?

38:56.467 --> 38:57.701
Oh, my God.

38:57.702 --> 39:00.170
I will take one for the team,
just show me.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.239
But sometimes when I drink,
it's not so good.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.013
All right, Cedric, let's cut the
shit, I'm hitting a massage parlor.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.446
She's a masseuse.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.147
- You're a masseuse?
- My God.

39:11.148 --> 39:16.161
Are you? Are you?
Oh, you rike a massage?

39:16.654 --> 39:18.321
- No happy endings.
- Fwip over.

39:18.322 --> 39:19.967
No happy endings.

39:20.057 --> 39:22.859
What? Come on. Come on.

39:22.860 --> 39:26.598
You're a masseuse?
Thank you, Jesus.

39:30.835 --> 39:35.705
And the longer the bit takes,
the drunker your star's gonna be.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.240
And that's just the truth.

39:37.241 --> 39:39.079
I'm drunk as fuck.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.913
- Thank you, Cedric. You're a good man.
- You're welcome, my man.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.782
- What a sweet man.
- Are you leaving me?

39:45.783 --> 39:50.487
Seven women in one night!
Seven women!

39:50.488 --> 39:52.793
My hero, Cedric!

39:56.527 --> 40:00.402
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, listen up,
listen up, listen up, listen up.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.298
First, that old gentleman
you just saw in here

40:02.299 --> 40:05.503
was Mr. Johnny Knoxville,
and we are shooting a movie.

40:06.937 --> 40:09.706
We shoot this whole strip club thing
and the stripper guys were so cool,

40:09.707 --> 40:12.776
they were so funny,
and just had great spirit.

40:12.777 --> 40:15.278
I was hoping one of you guys was
gonna knock me out tonight,

40:15.279 --> 40:19.249
but you caught on too fast.
You guys thought you had him.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.751
He's the boxer, he's the boxer.
He was about to...

40:21.752 --> 40:26.423
I am 0-83 lifetime in fights, so
I'd have been 0-84 after tonight.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.391
So, after we pranked the strippers,
we thought it'd be funny

40:28.392 --> 40:30.960
if they chased Irving through
the streets, you know,

40:30.961 --> 40:34.540
in their various states of undress,
trying to freak people out.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.247
Hey, hey, stop. What the fuck?

40:41.472 --> 40:44.516
Help! Oh, my God. Help!

40:49.713 --> 40:51.392
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

40:51.582 --> 40:54.558
Oh, Jesus Christ. Hey!

40:57.054 --> 40:59.131
Jesus, oh, my God.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.133
Oh, my God.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.564
Wail!

41:07.398 --> 41:09.703
Help, wait! Wait!

41:19.944 --> 41:24.991
Oh, my God. Help. Help! Help!

41:33.858 --> 41:35.537
What was that?

41:36.393 --> 41:38.038
I'm sorry.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.406
Baptists.

41:47.935 --> 41:50.046
What's your name again?

41:51.238 --> 41:53.306
I'm your husband, Irving Zisman.

41:53.307 --> 41:55.748
- You're my wife, Ellie Zisman.
- I love you.

41:57.177 --> 41:58.878
Spike knew Catherine Keener
from way back

41:58.879 --> 42:01.080
and he just basically
pulled favors.

42:01.081 --> 42:05.093
Keener's amazing at improvisation.
She's obviously an amazing actor,

42:05.185 --> 42:07.820
and so we kind of
wrangled her into it.

42:07.821 --> 42:10.433
Like, I don't think
she's ever shot with...

42:10.658 --> 42:12.892
The way we shoot is just chaos.
There's no, like...

42:12.893 --> 42:15.428
She's used to, like, "Okay,
what's this scene about?

42:15.429 --> 42:18.197
"What's the direction, director?"

42:18.198 --> 42:21.367
Well, I did want to talk to you about
my character before we started,

42:21.368 --> 42:23.102
- but I lost you.
- Okay.

42:23.103 --> 42:24.237
I mean, all I knew is that

42:24.238 --> 42:26.611
I was ultimately
gonna be the corpse.

42:28.242 --> 42:31.277
I had no idea where the
cameras were, I had nothing.

42:31.278 --> 42:34.447
You mean, you really
walk into it completely

42:34.448 --> 42:37.850
without any perspective on
what's real and what isn't,

42:37.851 --> 42:39.085
when you're doing it.

42:39.086 --> 42:41.154
We had the idea that
when Ellie, after Ellie died,

42:41.155 --> 42:43.623
the movie would end on

42:43.624 --> 42:45.497
her body being thrown off a bridge.

42:45.592 --> 42:46.893
Well, we'd need to motivate that,

42:46.894 --> 42:49.295
we need to show where did
that idea even come from,

42:49.296 --> 42:52.465
or it just looks like you're
ditching a corpse at the end.

42:52.466 --> 42:55.735
So, we figured we'd shoot a
prank with a funeral planner,

42:55.736 --> 42:58.849
where the idea of throwing Ellie's
body off a bridge first popped up.

42:59.239 --> 43:02.241
I'd really think

43:02.242 --> 43:06.584
you should consider burial
instead of cremation.

43:06.647 --> 43:07.914
I'm not interested in this.

43:07.915 --> 43:10.516
- Well, we have to make plans, honey.
- I'm not interested in this.

43:10.517 --> 43:13.920
I don't want anything.
I don't want to be buried,

43:13.921 --> 43:16.856
I don't want to be cremated.
I don't want to make a plan.

43:16.857 --> 43:20.259
I want him to take me, I want
him to throw me off a bridge.

43:20.260 --> 43:21.427
Do whatever you want.

43:21.428 --> 43:25.198
Of course, you cannot be
thrown out, off a bridge.

43:25.199 --> 43:27.233
- No.
- That's what I want.

43:27.234 --> 43:28.901
But, Ellie, even if you
go over the bridge,

43:28.902 --> 43:31.082
something needs to happen
to your body, right?

43:31.138 --> 43:33.072
Look, I have these
beautiful crypts.

43:33.073 --> 43:35.310
He blames me for his unhappiness.

43:35.642 --> 43:37.643
- Well...
- He blames me.

43:37.644 --> 43:39.045
- Well, we haven't...
- He blames me.

43:39.046 --> 43:42.386
- We haven't had sex in 12 years, so...
- That's not a lot.

43:45.652 --> 43:48.731
I can see that you've been
married for a long time.

43:49.990 --> 43:52.898
What is that? Stop it. God.

43:53.894 --> 43:54.994
I'm sorry.

43:54.995 --> 43:57.296
That's not funny.

43:57.297 --> 44:00.774
- It's not funny.
- Please kill me.

44:01.301 --> 44:03.269
You know why
he can't wait for me to die?

44:03.270 --> 44:05.905
Because he wants to have sex
with people like you.

44:05.906 --> 44:10.384
I'm not kidding you. I am not
kidding, that's the truth.

44:10.677 --> 44:14.882
If I die, please don't
take his calls.

44:17.985 --> 44:20.927
You're not gonna take my calls.
Take my calls.

44:21.088 --> 44:23.529
You want some gefilte fish?

44:24.291 --> 44:26.859
No, I don't even think
I know what that is.

44:26.860 --> 44:28.038
It's so good.

44:28.262 --> 44:31.164
So, I just want you to know that
we have wonderful payment plans,

44:31.165 --> 44:32.999
- if you want one or two.
- Is this another price list?

44:33.000 --> 44:35.339
No, actually, each burial is...

44:37.638 --> 44:39.943
I'm sorry you had to see that.

44:43.277 --> 44:45.479
- You okay?
- What is it?

44:46.647 --> 44:48.019
What are you...

44:49.516 --> 44:52.890
It's good, honey.

44:53.454 --> 44:55.497
Honey, that's cat food.

44:56.023 --> 44:58.362
Look at that, look at it.

44:59.293 --> 45:01.439
With chicken and gravy.

45:06.066 --> 45:07.939
Here, have some water.

45:16.443 --> 45:17.917
If you go...

45:34.495 --> 45:37.063
If, after she does...

45:37.064 --> 45:41.200
If she does pass on before me, is it
cool if I do call you afterwards?

45:41.201 --> 45:44.036
Yeah, of course you can call me.
I'm gonna give you my card.

45:44.037 --> 45:45.477
Sweet.

45:46.140 --> 45:48.141
Almost every scene we shot,

45:48.142 --> 45:51.110
we shot multiple times,
with multiple different people.

45:51.111 --> 45:54.413
You know it's gonna take a half hour
each time, or an hour each time,

45:54.414 --> 45:56.015
and you just stack the day up,

45:56.016 --> 45:57.884
'cause you'd never know
what you're gonna get.

45:57.885 --> 46:00.052
A funny thing happened
with the last lady we saw.

46:00.053 --> 46:02.255
She came in

46:02.256 --> 46:04.690
and she was the teacher,
we were the pupils,

46:04.691 --> 46:06.666
and she just took control
of the situation.

46:06.793 --> 46:08.728
Maybe they would give me half off

46:08.729 --> 46:11.030
since she already embalmed
me from the waist down.

46:11.031 --> 46:13.266
Irving, here's what I
want to say to you

46:13.267 --> 46:16.903
and I'm gonna say it as a
person, not as a professional.

46:16.904 --> 46:18.104
Yes, ma'am.

46:18.105 --> 46:22.108
If you refer any more
to your sexual depravation,

46:22.109 --> 46:25.111
then I'm gonna have to leave,
because that's not why I'm here.

46:25.112 --> 46:28.281
- Okay, I understand, I just am upset.
- Thank you. Thank you.

46:28.282 --> 46:32.828
And it's funny how her energy
just kind of made us behave.

46:32.886 --> 46:35.521
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:35.522 --> 46:37.156
And I apologize.

46:37.157 --> 46:38.591
- That's okay.
- I'm sorry.

46:38.592 --> 46:40.169
Thank you.

46:42.462 --> 46:46.610
After we revealed the prank to her,
she was such a good sport about it.

46:46.967 --> 46:48.201
- You!
- I am so sorry.

46:48.202 --> 46:49.468
- You.
- I'm sorry.

46:49.469 --> 46:51.037
- You're a bad man.
- I'm sorry.

46:51.038 --> 46:52.838
- You're, here's the deal, buddy.
- Isn't he terrible?

46:52.839 --> 46:54.740
Let me just tell you
something about you, Irving.

46:54.741 --> 46:58.544
The deal with you is that
you really sold it.

46:58.545 --> 47:01.214
- It's not that you didn't sell it.
- No, I know. No, he's right. No, I know.

47:01.215 --> 47:03.918
- I was terrified.
- But I thought, "What an asshole."

47:05.285 --> 47:07.726
You're not too far from
the truth, actually.

47:08.956 --> 47:10.623
A couple of weeks later,

47:10.624 --> 47:13.964
the lady sends an email to
our field producer, Jarrod,

47:14.027 --> 47:15.995
and it was the funniest email,

47:15.996 --> 47:19.302
recounting how she perceived
that whole prank.

47:19.433 --> 47:22.368
"Driving back on the 405,
happy to live in a town

47:22.369 --> 47:25.471
"where the ordinary can become
the extraordinary in an instant,

47:25.472 --> 47:28.474
"where normal life
can be interrupted by surprise

47:28.475 --> 47:31.444
"and where, for a moment,
if we're paying attention,

47:31.445 --> 47:34.180
"we can be lifted out of
the repetition of the routine

47:34.181 --> 47:38.056
"into a creative act that could
be hidden in every moment."

47:40.854 --> 47:43.534
She really put a happy
face on that prank.

47:55.002 --> 47:56.943
We are making

47:57.971 --> 48:01.240
an erection device.

48:01.241 --> 48:03.284
Kassak, can you take it up slow?

48:03.710 --> 48:05.745
There's Kosick in his gym shorts.

48:05.746 --> 48:09.749
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, look
at him, he's working out.

48:09.750 --> 48:11.987
He put a robe on.

48:15.389 --> 48:17.423
When you're not in shod range,

48:17.424 --> 48:21.360
the default position for the device

48:21.361 --> 48:23.262
is with the erection straight out.

48:23.263 --> 48:25.765
As soon as we got outside the
building, out of the range,

48:25.766 --> 48:27.466
I just had the biggest erection.

48:27.467 --> 48:29.468
And there was nothing
to cover it with,

48:29.469 --> 48:32.772
and it was sticking really far out.

48:32.773 --> 48:36.542
One of Hollywood's greatest
actresses, Catherine Keener,

48:36.543 --> 48:39.845
is helping me conceal this erection
the whole time around the building.

48:39.846 --> 48:42.526
I'm sorry, Catherine.

48:43.016 --> 48:45.718
Okay, who's the last one,
person who cut the card?

48:45.719 --> 48:48.821
I'm too old to cut the cards,
but I can still flop the queen,

48:48.822 --> 48:50.923
- if you know what I'm saying.
- Okay.

48:50.924 --> 48:54.627
I'm sorry, ma'am. It's my
wife and my 50th anniversary.

48:54.628 --> 48:56.268
I'm feeling a little
frisky tonight.

48:56.363 --> 48:58.543
Happy anniversary, baby.

48:59.700 --> 49:02.574
She got me a compass.

49:03.070 --> 49:04.136
Which is really sweet.

49:04.137 --> 49:06.572
I don't know how to open the
goddamn thing. There we go.

49:06.573 --> 49:07.973
Is there some reason
she gave you a compass?

49:07.974 --> 49:11.254
- Is this your hand right here, sir?
- So I can find the bottom of her vagina.

49:12.346 --> 49:15.254
- Stop it, God damn it.
- Okay.

49:15.315 --> 49:17.483
But you also need some longitudinal

49:17.484 --> 49:20.853
and latitudinal coordinates,
I think, to help.

49:20.854 --> 49:23.756
Or maybe some, like, mossy trees.

49:23.757 --> 49:25.624
You got it, you got it, my friends.

49:25.625 --> 49:27.600
She's got a mossy tree.

49:27.961 --> 49:29.562
But, I mean, your wife's Japanese,

49:29.563 --> 49:30.863
- so you get that.
- What did you say?

49:30.864 --> 49:32.839
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
- Yeah.

49:33.066 --> 49:35.439
He says his wife's Japanese
and she's got a hairy one.

49:37.871 --> 49:39.672
What'd you get me for my present?

49:39.673 --> 49:42.708
I will, baby, can I tell
you in a second, baby?

49:42.709 --> 49:43.843
What'd you get me?
What'd you get me?

49:43.844 --> 49:45.478
- What'd you get me?
- Baby, let's play, let's play.

49:45.479 --> 49:46.746
Okay, what'd you get me?
What'd you get me?

49:46.747 --> 49:48.314
Baby, let's play.

49:48.315 --> 49:50.082
We got married 50 years ago today.

49:50.083 --> 49:51.617
I can't tell her what I got her.

49:51.618 --> 49:53.388
- Today! Fifty years ago.
- Okay.

49:54.321 --> 49:57.092
I took two Viagra!

49:57.357 --> 50:00.659
Good, good, good, good, good,
that's gonna be good for you,

50:00.660 --> 50:04.239
very good for you later tonight,
yeah. Yeah, good luck.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.611
Give me your hand.

50:09.236 --> 50:12.508
Okay, okay, there's my hand.

50:12.939 --> 50:15.074
- That's all right.
- This is my baby girl right here.

50:15.075 --> 50:17.476
- I believe you, I believe you.
- What are you doing?

50:17.477 --> 50:19.044
Ain't it hard?

50:19.045 --> 50:22.249
Yeah, yeah. That's great.
That's, that's, that's wonderful.

50:25.252 --> 50:27.253
- She got me a golden compass.
- Right, right, right.

50:27.254 --> 50:29.555
I took two Viagra tonight.

50:29.556 --> 50:31.793
That's your gift, baby.

50:31.825 --> 50:33.959
She got me a compass,
I got her a teepee.

50:33.960 --> 50:36.162
Oh, my God.

50:36.163 --> 50:40.065
Stop it, stop it! I don't
think that it's that funny.

50:40.066 --> 50:43.543
Baby, baby, come here, baby.

50:43.603 --> 50:46.340
You guys are fucking crazy.

50:48.241 --> 50:51.577
Oh, my God, those, that couple, you
couldn't have gotten better marks.

50:51.578 --> 50:55.381
- They were so sweet.
- Please stop. Somebody call stop.

50:55.382 --> 50:57.917
We cut. We're telling
everyone right now.

50:57.918 --> 50:59.893
- Do we have to go back out?
- No, no.

51:02.389 --> 51:06.264
I hate this job.
I fucking hate you.

51:09.229 --> 51:12.898
This is Handsome Jack Heartthrob,
he's gonna be our corpse for the day.

51:12.899 --> 51:17.303
This is our hearse, and we're
gonna ride around and...

51:17.304 --> 51:20.212
- Car.
- Car.

51:20.874 --> 51:23.008
This is the second funeral bit
you've done with us.

51:23.009 --> 51:24.643
On the TV show, he...

51:24.644 --> 51:27.680
On the TV show,
Jack was playing her pad

51:27.681 --> 51:29.482
and falling out of the
back of the hearse.

51:29.483 --> 51:32.051
Wait, wait, how do we know this
thing's not gonna flip over, though?

51:32.052 --> 51:34.553
- We don't.
- Yeah, how do we know that?

51:34.554 --> 51:35.955
We have no idea.

51:35.956 --> 51:38.424
- So, we have no idea.
- It's called trial and error.

51:38.425 --> 51:40.459
We don't know it's
not gonna flip over.

51:40.460 --> 51:43.262
If it flips over, try to come
out as dead as possible.

51:43.263 --> 51:46.131
'Cause if you break your fall,
it's not gonna look very good

51:46.132 --> 51:48.243
for a dead guy to break his fall.

51:53.640 --> 51:55.841
So your face was all whitish green.

51:55.842 --> 51:58.744
It was white, because Spike
goes, "I'm a makeup artist."

51:58.745 --> 52:01.347
And he just took baby powder
and slammed it in my face.

52:01.348 --> 52:02.891
He's a makeup artist.

52:07.821 --> 52:09.830
What is he doing?

52:12.025 --> 52:13.670
How's Spike's breath?

52:14.227 --> 52:15.427
Is that...

52:15.428 --> 52:18.575
It's cutting through that baby
powder scent, that's for sure.

52:19.900 --> 52:22.376
Insufficient funds, my tuchus.

52:22.869 --> 52:26.312
I am very sorry about all of this.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.708
But you have insufficient
funds, what else can we do?

52:29.709 --> 52:32.150
I'll tell you what you can do,
you can kiss my tuchus.

52:32.812 --> 52:35.014
I don't want you to
bury her anyway.

52:35.382 --> 52:38.461
- Mr. Zisman.
- Get out of my sight. Get!

52:41.354 --> 52:45.229
Can you believe that yahoo?
How we gonna do this?

52:47.027 --> 52:49.901
Come on. Push her close.

52:50.997 --> 52:53.006
Watch out, watch out.

52:55.402 --> 52:56.603
God.

53:03.877 --> 53:05.454
Oh, God.

53:07.147 --> 53:08.758
Get in the car.

53:19.259 --> 53:21.871
- What are we shooting here today?
- We have...

53:22.796 --> 53:24.771
- Smelly Ellie.
- Smelly Ellie.

53:26.866 --> 53:30.604
We're gonna get someone to try to
help bury her in the backyard.

53:31.137 --> 53:34.139
We thought it'd be funny to
hire a guy to come over

53:34.140 --> 53:37.101
and dig a hole in the backyard,
thinking it's for a tree or something,

53:37.143 --> 53:39.545
and then spring it on them that,

53:39.546 --> 53:42.615
"No, what actually, this is for my
wife, and would you carry the body

53:42.616 --> 53:45.818
"out from the house and drop
it in the hole and bury her?"

53:45.819 --> 53:49.557
I had a terrible time at the funeral
home trying to bury my wife.

53:49.990 --> 53:54.002
I was wondering if
I could pay you a little money

53:55.462 --> 53:59.269
to help me bury her
in her favorite spot.

53:59.332 --> 54:01.534
I can't do that, no.

54:03.003 --> 54:05.945
I can give you an extra $60.

54:07.440 --> 54:11.010
I don't think that's legal, and I don't
want to be getting into trouble.

54:11.011 --> 54:14.947
We tried this in Columbus, and
people wanted nothing to do with it.

54:14.948 --> 54:16.889
No, I can't do that.

54:16.916 --> 54:20.097
Can you help me just carry
her outside to bury her?

54:20.120 --> 54:21.720
No, I can't do that.

54:21.721 --> 54:23.195
Please help.

54:23.623 --> 54:25.424
Please help an old man.

54:25.425 --> 54:27.760
So, basically, we did not
get the bit in Ohio,

54:27.761 --> 54:30.996
so we moved it to North Carolina 'cause
that's where our next location to shoot was.

54:30.997 --> 54:35.703
This is the second time trying to get
someone to help me bury the body,

54:36.870 --> 54:42.679
and I'm feeling kinda confident
today that it's gonna happen.

54:43.410 --> 54:48.150
I think the vibe I was
putting out last time was,

54:48.648 --> 54:51.550
wasn't one of positivity.

54:51.551 --> 54:53.819
Today, I'm gonna be
a little more positive

54:53.820 --> 54:57.399
in trying to get the mark
to help me do it.

54:59.159 --> 55:02.961
I was telling you my wife
passed away a couple days ago

55:02.962 --> 55:08.407
and she requested a home burial.

55:09.235 --> 55:12.771
And we are gonna put
her in that hole,

55:12.772 --> 55:15.851
and put a dogwood
tree on top of her.

55:16.209 --> 55:20.946
And I was wondering if you could
help me carry her out there,

55:20.947 --> 55:23.184
- and put her in the hole, please.
- Okay.

55:23.650 --> 55:25.261
If we just...

55:26.119 --> 55:29.095
Okay. Here we go.

55:29.589 --> 55:30.756
You know, just throw
her in there, huh?

55:30.757 --> 55:33.292
Yeah, yeah. Well... Let me, okay.

55:33.293 --> 55:34.904
- All right, leave her go.
- One...

55:35.095 --> 55:36.161
Leave her go.

55:36.162 --> 55:38.740
Leave her go? All right.

55:39.432 --> 55:41.873
Oh, my goodness.

55:41.935 --> 55:44.036
- How much do I owe you?
- $325.

55:44.037 --> 55:48.540
I don't really know about
the legality of all this, so...

55:48.541 --> 55:51.543
$325? Yeah, all right.

55:51.544 --> 55:53.045
I'll give you an extra $100.

55:53.046 --> 55:56.318
That day I had two different people

55:57.984 --> 56:02.462
help me bury a body
in the backyard.

56:03.890 --> 56:05.125
Let's see.

56:05.959 --> 56:09.828
We'll just, I mean, we're just
gonna drop her in, all right?

56:09.829 --> 56:12.168
Okay, one, two, three.

56:14.234 --> 56:15.742
Oh, shit.

56:16.903 --> 56:19.238
Jeff just completely discounted

56:19.239 --> 56:21.578
someone was gonna
put it in the ground.

56:21.674 --> 56:25.811
Lord, please take my Ellie girl

56:25.812 --> 56:29.915
into the Palace of Elysium.

56:29.916 --> 56:31.959
She's a good girl.

56:33.620 --> 56:36.323
I'm actually kind of
sugarcoating that a little.

56:36.422 --> 56:41.765
She was always, earplugs, son. She
was always kind of a bitch, Lord.

56:43.163 --> 56:49.211
Wouldn't give me any poon the
last 10 years of our marriage,

56:49.702 --> 56:52.971
and not even a OTPHJ.

56:52.972 --> 56:55.516
That's an over the pants handjob.

56:55.875 --> 56:58.210
And then we got rid
of that whole idea altogether

56:58.211 --> 56:59.978
and decided to take
the body on the road.

56:59.979 --> 57:03.715
I think it went amazing. We had
three different sets of people

57:03.716 --> 57:06.226
help me dispose of a body today.

57:09.189 --> 57:12.958
Two into a shallow grave
dug in the backyard,

57:12.959 --> 57:16.265
and one just helped me
put her in the trunk.

57:18.231 --> 57:21.099
So, Gloria should be coming in,
into town next week, right?

57:21.100 --> 57:24.577
Yeah, there's her tits and vagina
hanging in that closet over there.

57:25.171 --> 57:27.214
Look at that beat-up old pussy.

57:30.577 --> 57:32.811
Well, Gloria's someone that
we've shot with before.

57:32.812 --> 57:36.081
It's really just Spike dressed as
an old lady, doing crazy stuff.

57:36.082 --> 57:38.517
That was, you know, what we
shot on Jackass Number Two.

57:38.518 --> 57:40.118
That's where Gloria was born.

57:40.119 --> 57:42.487
- I'm Irving.
- And I'm Gloria.

57:42.488 --> 57:44.668
And we're a dirty old couple.

57:47.594 --> 57:49.194
In the second one, I was Gloria.

57:49.195 --> 57:52.774
I was this old lady, and she
was very, very forward.

57:53.199 --> 57:56.676
Probably pretty promiscuous
and maybe even a slut.

57:56.736 --> 57:58.971
Hey, you guys like to party?

57:58.972 --> 58:01.907
Hey, Cordell, you
look handsome there.

58:01.908 --> 58:03.382
Thank you.

58:03.877 --> 58:05.944
You boys wanna party?

58:05.945 --> 58:08.921
Gloria, since last we met her,
I think she's evolved a lot.

58:08.982 --> 58:12.384
Gloria can be very of-the-Earth
and at one with herself

58:12.385 --> 58:13.886
and nature and the universe.

58:13.887 --> 58:16.192
And she can share her pussy
with everyone.

58:16.256 --> 58:18.223
Steve, can I get
some hand sanitizer, please?

58:18.224 --> 58:22.594
- Well, here's our new dispenser.
- Well, I'll take a little of that.

58:22.595 --> 58:24.706
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, sweetheart

58:25.031 --> 58:27.232
Dimitry, do I look prettier
than I ever have before?

58:27.233 --> 58:29.034
Yeah, you do. You look... Yeah.

58:29.035 --> 58:32.104
That was all I wanted. I just asked
them to make me look pretty this time.

58:32.105 --> 58:33.538
- 'Cause I was so...
- You look gorgeous.

58:33.539 --> 58:34.840
I was so demented last time.

58:34.841 --> 58:36.575
I do look really pretty, right?

58:36.576 --> 58:37.809
You have great skin for your age.

58:37.810 --> 58:39.284
- You aged well.
- Thank you.

58:39.612 --> 58:45.284
Gloria, it's tricky, 'cause,
okay, the nice way to put it is

58:45.285 --> 58:48.220
I have very strong features.
I have a big nose.

58:48.221 --> 58:50.025
Spike has very strong features.

58:50.189 --> 58:54.760
To make strong features feminine
is a really rough battle

58:54.761 --> 58:57.262
because the makeup is
an additive process.

58:57.263 --> 59:02.913
Gloria was always
the tough one to crack.

59:02.936 --> 59:04.945
Gloria, you ready for the day?

59:06.072 --> 59:07.306
I don't know.

59:07.307 --> 59:09.612
I mean, yeah, of course.

59:10.043 --> 59:13.378
My whole reason for bringing
Gloria back in this movie

59:13.379 --> 59:16.214
was to shoot a sex scene
with Irving and Gloria.

59:16.215 --> 59:17.416
That's all I wanted to do.

59:17.417 --> 59:21.520
I wanted those two
to be in full body makeup,

59:21.521 --> 59:24.289
and have to do a sex scene, 'cause
neither of them wanted to do that.

59:24.290 --> 59:25.628
They hated that idea.

59:25.658 --> 59:27.392
And he kept coming
back to it, he's like,

59:27.393 --> 59:30.862
"What if we go to San Diego and you
guys have sex in front of a ship?"

59:30.863 --> 59:33.304
Like, things that
didn't even make sense.

59:34.400 --> 59:38.470
So, Gloria in the story
for Bad Grandpa was...

59:38.471 --> 59:39.938
We thought she was gonna be

59:39.939 --> 59:43.308
the old high-school sweetheart
that got away from him.

59:43.309 --> 59:45.811
We decided, we'll just
meet her in a restaurant,

59:45.812 --> 59:48.613
but we'll already
have a date there with her

59:48.614 --> 59:50.885
that we were gonna
get off Craigslist.

59:50.950 --> 59:55.253
Oh, yeah, man. Your email responses
were just off, all night long.

59:55.254 --> 59:57.991
Like, all... I got
like 50 responses.

59:58.992 --> 01:00:01.672
- Oh, 50, I got 50 dates?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:01.928 --> 01:00:03.628
It's all these guys
who are answering this ad,

01:00:03.629 --> 01:00:07.632
some of them are legitimate, like,
you know, older guys themselves.

01:00:07.633 --> 01:00:11.940
But some of them were
just creepy. You know?

01:00:12.038 --> 01:00:18.519
There was a guy that would only come if
he was promised mutual masturbation.

01:00:20.346 --> 01:00:22.082
And we said yes.

01:00:22.415 --> 01:00:26.825
I had a lot of, you know, lot of
firsts that week in North Carolina,

01:00:27.053 --> 01:00:30.922
where I found myself,
like, like getting propo...

01:00:30.923 --> 01:00:33.859
Like, the man that wanted to give
me a massa... Like, nude massages.

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.495
Yes, that, that'd be fun,
bring your massage table,

01:00:36.496 --> 01:00:37.863
I've never done that.

01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:39.765
I'm a, you know, I'm very curious,

01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:42.913
I'm a very, you know,
interested, curious person.

01:00:43.302 --> 01:00:48.315
And another man that wanted me
to talk... To dominate him.

01:00:48.374 --> 01:00:50.776
You are a naughty boy.

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:54.220
And that you need
a little discipline.

01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:58.016
Okay? Now, you get in your
car and you drive over here,

01:00:58.017 --> 01:01:00.163
and quit being so naughty.

01:01:01.187 --> 01:01:03.922
You just shut up. You do not
talk about your feelings,

01:01:03.923 --> 01:01:06.330
'cause I don't give a fuck
about your feelings.

01:01:06.893 --> 01:01:09.573
No, you don't say that,
or you say, "Yes, ma'am."

01:01:10.663 --> 01:01:12.843
Or I'll smack the fuck outta you.

01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:20.539
And then Spike felt weird because
he thought the guy may have been

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:23.516
taking care of himself
while he was talking to them.

01:01:23.543 --> 01:01:25.313
Are you touching yourself?

01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:33.589
You don't like being, do...

01:01:36.155 --> 01:01:39.224
You just think about that
for 25 seconds, okay?

01:01:39.225 --> 01:01:41.193
You're a bad boy,
you go into the corner.

01:01:41.194 --> 01:01:44.534
He's never gonna be on camera.
He won't even go in the restaurant.

01:01:44.864 --> 01:01:49.012
I mean, I had mixed feelings
about this situation.

01:01:49.602 --> 01:01:52.874
And, but, you know,
we gotta make a movie, right?

01:01:52.905 --> 01:01:55.585
Bottom line is it's so
poorly thought out because,

01:01:56.576 --> 01:01:59.978
well, who the hell's gonna sign
a release form after the fact,

01:01:59.979 --> 01:02:01.580
like, they're gonna come out
looking like,

01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:04.382
"Oh, my God, I was just out
there trying to hook up

01:02:04.383 --> 01:02:07.621
"with an 85-year-old freak show."

01:02:07.653 --> 01:02:09.688
I don't wanna lead you on, I'm...

01:02:09.689 --> 01:02:12.390
You're not leading me on.
That's not an issue.

01:02:12.391 --> 01:02:13.959
I know, but you're coming
on to me and so I don't...

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.527
I was not coming on to you.

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:16.795
You were kind of coming on to her.

01:02:16.796 --> 01:02:18.697
I was not coming on to her.

01:02:18.698 --> 01:02:20.398
- A little.
- It seemed that way when I came in.

01:02:20.399 --> 01:02:22.134
It shouldn't seem that way.

01:02:22.135 --> 01:02:23.201
Yeah.

01:02:23.202 --> 01:02:27.072
That pad when you told me about how
good my Kundalini was, was kinda...

01:02:27.073 --> 01:02:30.175
We didn't talk about your Kundalini.
I don't know what a Kundalini is.

01:02:30.176 --> 01:02:32.043
You showed him your Kundalini?

01:02:32.044 --> 01:02:34.485
No, but I think he could imagine.

01:02:34.514 --> 01:02:39.784
I met a man named... We're gonna
have to beep that, though,

01:02:39.785 --> 01:02:42.488
because he wanted to fuck me
in the ass. Oops.

01:02:43.389 --> 01:02:47.059
I don't know. A lot of them wouldn't sign
the releases, let's put it that way.

01:02:49.362 --> 01:02:50.462
Hey!

01:02:50.463 --> 01:02:51.698
Hi!

01:02:53.065 --> 01:02:54.232
So nice to meet you.

01:02:54.233 --> 01:02:55.333
Nice to meet you.

01:02:55.334 --> 01:02:57.536
Where are you going?

01:02:57.537 --> 01:02:58.737
I've I got here early. And I think

01:02:58.738 --> 01:03:01.439
I got another appointment to
go to. I tried to call you.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.908
And do you have five minutes?

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.089
No, I need to go to the other
appointment now.

01:03:05.511 --> 01:03:08.146
That's okay. I'll
just get some coffee.

01:03:08.147 --> 01:03:10.759
Okay. All right, honey. Thanks.

01:03:12.084 --> 01:03:13.763
One other thing...

01:03:14.954 --> 01:03:17.100
You think we could
meet later on tonight?

01:03:17.123 --> 01:03:19.891
Uh no, uh-uh.

01:03:19.892 --> 01:03:22.794
Maybe a, you know, a little
booty call around midnight?

01:03:22.795 --> 01:03:24.065
No, uh-uh.

01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:25.764
Okay. Hope you have a good night.

01:03:25.765 --> 01:03:27.098
All right, uh-uh.

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:28.676
I got stood up.

01:03:28.701 --> 01:03:30.902
A lot of more funny ones
wouldn't sign releases.

01:03:30.903 --> 01:03:32.537
Like, one guy showed up
and he wanted to...

01:03:32.538 --> 01:03:33.772
He wasn't very nice to me,

01:03:33.773 --> 01:03:36.274
he just wanted to eat
and fuck, basically.

01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:40.082
And, you know, I wanted a
little conversation first.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.350
He showed up and he was just angry.
You know, he just sat down angry.

01:03:45.351 --> 01:03:47.155
Of course, he was angry.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.701
I gotta go to the restroom.

01:03:49.488 --> 01:03:50.689
I gotta use the restroom.

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:53.666
- No. Irving.
- Yeah, you know what, I'm, let's, let...

01:03:53.759 --> 01:03:55.905
I said I had to go to the restroom.

01:03:56.062 --> 01:03:58.863
Jesus. Well, you didn't
have to go and...

01:03:58.864 --> 01:03:59.931
I did.

01:03:59.932 --> 01:04:01.770
Slam me to the ground.

01:04:01.801 --> 01:04:04.603
But, the nice thing is, like, I did
feel vulnerable, but I felt like,

01:04:04.604 --> 01:04:06.304
you know, you guys had
my back, basically.

01:04:06.305 --> 01:04:08.951
You weren't gonna let me get raped.

01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:12.244
Except Jeff. Jeff would
have let me get raped.

01:04:12.245 --> 01:04:15.688
No, I gotta go.
Fuck this. Fuck this.

01:04:16.282 --> 01:04:20.396
I'm talking to too many,
too many weirdoes.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.587
The first day got a
little bit dark,

01:04:22.588 --> 01:04:25.690
so we retooled the ad,
made it a little bit softer,

01:04:25.691 --> 01:04:28.030
and the next day we met Javier.

01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:33.442
Who was just a guy in a new town, and
just looking to meet new people.

01:04:33.499 --> 01:04:36.434
And that poor guy stayed,

01:04:36.435 --> 01:04:38.945
and was nice enough to
sign a release at the end.

01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:40.872
Javier?

01:04:40.873 --> 01:04:42.140
Yes, it's me.

01:04:42.141 --> 01:04:44.943
Hi, how are you? Gloria,
it's so nice to meet you.

01:04:44.944 --> 01:04:46.214
Nice to meet you, too.

01:04:46.545 --> 01:04:48.913
- How was your drive?
- It was fine.

01:04:48.914 --> 01:04:50.982
Good, good. The traffic died down?

01:04:50.983 --> 01:04:52.984
Yes, nice and light, thank God.

01:04:52.985 --> 01:04:55.253
Good, good. Yeah.

01:04:55.254 --> 01:04:57.856
Well, let me, here,
let me see your energy.

01:04:57.857 --> 01:04:59.058
Okay.

01:04:59.091 --> 01:05:01.498
Now breathe into
your chest with me.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.233
Oh, good. Okay, now breathe
into your stomach.

01:05:09.568 --> 01:05:11.469
Oh, good, good, that's nice, okay.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.616
Now breathe into your
Johnson with me.

01:05:14.073 --> 01:05:15.573
Okay, that's interesting.

01:05:15.574 --> 01:05:17.809
I've never been asked to
do that third one before.

01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:21.184
- Yeah, it's... It helps with your energy.
- Gloria!

01:05:22.782 --> 01:05:24.716
- Irving?
- Hey, Gloria.

01:05:24.717 --> 01:05:26.818
How are you, what are you doing?
What are you doing here tonight?

01:05:26.819 --> 01:05:29.521
- How are you, sweetheart?
- Hi, Gloria, nice to meet you, I'm Billy.

01:05:29.522 --> 01:05:32.324
- Billy, nice to meet you.
- It's my grandson.

01:05:32.325 --> 01:05:34.159
This is my new friend, Javier.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.861
- Javier? Hey, man, como estas?
- Hi.

01:05:36.862 --> 01:05:39.331
- How are you doing? Yes.
- Good, good. How are you?

01:05:39.332 --> 01:05:41.299
- Hey, let me in, Javier.
- Yeah, sure.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.502
Oh, no. We're... I apologize.

01:05:43.736 --> 01:05:46.037
Where's the waitress?
I need a coffee.

01:05:46.038 --> 01:05:48.740
You need a coffee?
You look really stoned.

01:05:48.741 --> 01:05:50.262
- Irving, maybe...
- No, I'm okay.

01:05:50.676 --> 01:05:52.744
Ma'am, can I get some cream?

01:05:52.745 --> 01:05:54.245
- Certainly!
- Can I get some cream?

01:05:54.246 --> 01:05:55.480
Oh, you know what?

01:05:55.481 --> 01:05:56.548
I'm sorry, there's
some cream right here.

01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:58.516
No, no, no, no,
you don't want this cream.

01:05:58.517 --> 01:06:00.552
You don't want this cream.

01:06:00.553 --> 01:06:02.587
That has a lot of chemicals in it.

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:05.769
I want you to have my milk.

01:06:07.293 --> 01:06:08.760
Okay.

01:06:08.761 --> 01:06:10.167
Oh, dear Lord.

01:06:13.866 --> 01:06:15.066
I have a gift.

01:06:15.067 --> 01:06:19.938
The Lord has given me this gift,
since I was a young woman.

01:06:19.939 --> 01:06:23.942
It's amazing, I've never had children,
but I still lactate to this day,

01:06:23.943 --> 01:06:26.316
and I don't know how and why.

01:06:26.345 --> 01:06:28.320
- Here, try that.
- Did that just happen?

01:06:31.517 --> 01:06:32.718
You smell.

01:06:35.054 --> 01:06:36.721
- Good, it has a lot of protein.
- It smells okay.

01:06:36.722 --> 01:06:39.198
- Doesn't smell bad, right?
- No, it's okay.

01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:50.034
Let me tell you something.
Here, scoot over.

01:06:50.035 --> 01:06:51.936
- What? All right.
- I just need to sit closer to Javier.

01:06:51.937 --> 01:06:54.083
Scoot, scoot over, Julio.

01:06:54.974 --> 01:06:57.085
Can I get a little more cream?

01:06:57.476 --> 01:07:00.779
- Oh, sure. 'Cause I know...
- But not in my coffee.

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:04.484
Javier likes it when
I show him my mother's milk.

01:07:04.884 --> 01:07:06.358
Right here.

01:07:07.453 --> 01:07:08.631
Oh, sure.

01:07:10.122 --> 01:07:11.767
Oh, pen is... You look...

01:07:11.957 --> 01:07:13.892
- Javier, do you want some?
- No, it's okay.

01:07:13.893 --> 01:07:15.126
- Do you want some?
- I'm okay.

01:07:15.127 --> 01:07:18.096
Does that turn you on when I
do that? Look at me in the eye.

01:07:18.097 --> 01:07:20.709
- Make eye contact. I like that.
- No.

01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:24.946
He's making eye contact
with me, Irving.

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:27.915
Okay.

01:07:28.808 --> 01:07:31.784
Okay, can I go to the
restroom, please?

01:07:31.977 --> 01:07:34.312
- Thank you.
- Talk about a cockblock.

01:07:34.313 --> 01:07:35.780
- Javier, I apologize, okay.
- I'll be right back.

01:07:35.781 --> 01:07:36.848
It's all right, I'll be right back.

01:07:36.849 --> 01:07:38.716
No, I think he's gonna
run for the border.

01:07:38.717 --> 01:07:41.019
He jumped out of the bathroom
window and ran away.

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.497
Luckily, Guch caught him,
and then he signed.

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:46.591
Did he take off out
the backdoor or something?

01:07:46.592 --> 01:07:47.896
Maybe he did.

01:07:49.228 --> 01:07:51.931
- Yeah, he's out of here.
- He's gone?

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:54.241
Spike and I have a
ball when we shoot,

01:07:54.467 --> 01:07:59.241
but he also enjoys pushing my
buttons a little when we shoot.

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:05.987
Oh, boy.

01:08:06.178 --> 01:08:08.517
She's a feisty one today.

01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:11.857
- I can see.
- Oh, boy.

01:08:13.352 --> 01:08:16.761
- That was tongue in my ear.
- Look at me, don't look at her.

01:08:19.024 --> 01:08:21.363
- Look at me.
- You're getting a little feisty, baby.

01:08:22.127 --> 01:08:23.930
Look in my eyes.

01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:27.372
You're so pretty.

01:08:29.602 --> 01:08:31.839
Oh, boy.

01:08:33.671 --> 01:08:36.216
I had to make out with Spike,
that was terrible.

01:08:36.942 --> 01:08:39.277
He really lingers
when you're kissing.

01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:42.080
He's not like a get-it-over and...

01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:45.591
No, he lingers after he kisses.

01:08:45.885 --> 01:08:47.385
Terrible.

01:08:47.386 --> 01:08:49.354
As soon as I realized that

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:51.923
Knoxville was getting uncomfortable
when I'd try and kiss him,

01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:53.358
then I, of course, couldn't stop.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:56.301
I was like, every chance I could,
I'd try and make out with him.

01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:59.832
You ever... No!

01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:04.868
What, why are you so nervous?
Why, why are you so nervous?

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:06.337
Cut!

01:09:06.337 --> 01:09:09.573
- Let me see what you've got down there.
- No! Stop, stop, stop.

01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:11.709
- Stop, stop!
- What's wrong, PJ?

01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:14.078
PJ? You dropped character.

01:09:14.078 --> 01:09:17.282
Come here, son. Pull
your pants down.

01:09:17.283 --> 01:09:19.417
No! Oh, no! God!

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.585
Come here.

01:09:20.586 --> 01:09:22.053
- Please stop, please stop.
- Get your clothes off.

01:09:22.054 --> 01:09:24.063
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:25.925 --> 01:09:27.325
Come on, you're getting me
all hot and bothered.

01:09:27.326 --> 01:09:29.327
You can't just turn me
on like that and let me,

01:09:29.328 --> 01:09:31.261
make me go home empty-handed.

01:09:31.263 --> 01:09:32.999
Okay, I'm done.

01:09:40.205 --> 01:09:44.108
Hey, sir, could you help me get these
beers to my car? I'm so sorry.

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:46.380
Yes, sir. Not a
problem, not a problem.

01:09:46.511 --> 01:09:47.912
How are you doing today?

01:09:47.912 --> 01:09:49.314
I'm doing good. How about you?

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:51.549
I'm, well, I've been better.

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:53.585
You know, my wife
just died recently.

01:09:53.586 --> 01:09:55.697
So working myself through it.

01:09:57.022 --> 01:09:59.759
Honey, I am so sorry,

01:10:00.659 --> 01:10:02.427
I apologize.

01:10:02.428 --> 01:10:04.699
Is it a dead person in your trunk?

01:10:05.264 --> 01:10:07.466
It's my wife, Ellie.

01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:12.837
Ernest!

01:10:12.838 --> 01:10:15.314
I'm going to get my grandson
now. God bless you.

01:10:23.182 --> 01:10:27.023
Irving, Irving, wait!
Wait, what are you doing?

01:10:27.753 --> 01:10:30.521
Like, what the hell is wrong
with y'all people?

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:31.689
Where is he?

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:36.260
Please, you have eyebrows
glued on you and everything,

01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:38.162
like, what is wrong with y'all?

01:10:38.163 --> 01:10:39.564
What do you mean?

01:10:39.565 --> 01:10:42.100
He's riding around with
a dead person in the trunk.

01:10:42.101 --> 01:10:44.035
That's his wife.

01:10:44.036 --> 01:10:46.638
Why is he riding around with
a dead person in the trunk?

01:10:46.639 --> 01:10:48.139
Because she died.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.150
Okay, why has she not been buried?

01:10:52.277 --> 01:10:54.278
Because he had an issue
at the funeral home,

01:10:54.279 --> 01:10:56.814
and he's gonna bury her himself.

01:10:56.815 --> 01:10:58.282
But we're going to
Florida right now,

01:10:58.283 --> 01:11:01.259
we're going to the
Florida Keys together.

01:11:03.188 --> 01:11:04.958
We're, we're lovers.

01:11:05.691 --> 01:11:06.858
Y'all are lovers.

01:11:06.859 --> 01:11:08.367
Yeah.

01:11:08.494 --> 01:11:11.863
- Well, he just left. I called the police.
- Is he on his way back to pick me up?

01:11:11.864 --> 01:11:14.832
- No, he gonna get in trouble.
- But is he coming back to pick me up?

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:17.912
No, he is not coming back. I told
him I was calling the police.

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.638
Actually, you know what,
maybe don't call the police.

01:11:20.639 --> 01:11:21.973
Yeah, I'm calling the police.

01:11:21.974 --> 01:11:24.415
Maybe if you don't call the police.

01:11:25.477 --> 01:11:27.011
Yeah, I'm calling.

01:11:27.012 --> 01:11:29.988
What if, what if you just
stopped calling the police?

01:11:30.382 --> 01:11:32.950
Yes, I need police to
Giant Penny on The Plaza.

01:11:32.951 --> 01:11:34.819
No, you're being silly.

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.220
And then this lady that's
talking in my background...

01:11:36.221 --> 01:11:38.958
We should call it.
She's getting too worked up.

01:11:39.792 --> 01:11:41.335
Okay.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.462
Can somebody come over?

01:11:43.929 --> 01:11:45.430
Can I tell you something, ma'am?

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:48.352
- It's okay, lady. It's all pad of a TV show.
- We're making a movie.

01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:50.774
We're making a movie.

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:57.110
Ma'am, I'm so sorry. I'm not
even a woman. I'm a man.

01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:01.579
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.
You were so nice.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.714
Okay, okay.

01:12:02.715 --> 01:12:04.515
- What's your name?
- Robin.

01:12:04.516 --> 01:12:06.350
- I'm Spike. So nice to meet you.
- Spike.

01:12:06.351 --> 01:12:08.431
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:12:08.487 --> 01:12:10.064
She was too nice.

01:12:11.023 --> 01:12:13.791
So that we have a tantric
sex lady coming at...

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:14.926
At 2:00?

01:12:14.927 --> 01:12:16.294
Yeah, you know
what tantric sex is, right?

01:12:16.295 --> 01:12:18.975
Yeah, it's where you fuck
with a lot of eye contact.

01:12:19.898 --> 01:12:24.103
Of course. I read about it
in a pamphlet in my church.

01:12:27.005 --> 01:12:29.307
Yeah, the sex therapy,
I think it was Spike's idea,

01:12:29.308 --> 01:12:33.923
he wanted to get these, like,
spiritual healers to help him,

01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:40.386
finally break through so Irving
can have sex with him, her.

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:43.928
Yeah, does any of
this newfangled voodooinsky,

01:12:45.023 --> 01:12:47.726
is it gonna loosen her up
in the old bunglestein?

01:12:48.761 --> 01:12:51.601
- This might heal you a little bit.
- A little of the pink.

01:12:52.564 --> 01:12:53.965
How's that feel?

01:12:53.966 --> 01:12:56.544
It feels like you're rubbing
a rock on my face. Stop it.

01:12:57.603 --> 01:13:00.374
I'm gonna just put it over here.
This feels nice here.

01:13:01.173 --> 01:13:02.774
Well, I kind of need it
here for the reading.

01:13:02.775 --> 01:13:03.875
Okay.

01:13:03.876 --> 01:13:05.543
But you can hold it until
we get to that point.

01:13:05.544 --> 01:13:06.778
Okay.

01:13:06.779 --> 01:13:09.789
- And I put it there because it is for love.
- Yeah.

01:13:11.383 --> 01:13:13.317
So, see, we already found
some stuff you can do.

01:13:13.318 --> 01:13:15.686
Go up to The Portal,
get some rose quartz.

01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:16.988
The Porthole?

01:13:16.989 --> 01:13:18.656
The Portal.

01:13:18.657 --> 01:13:20.324
Where you can get these rocks.

01:13:20.325 --> 01:13:21.759
Can I see this one again?
This one's...

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.328
Not if you put it in your crotch!
It cannot go in your crotch.

01:13:24.329 --> 01:13:25.730
- Why?
- It could fit in there.

01:13:25.731 --> 01:13:28.232
- Because it's my rock.
- You use this in your crotch?

01:13:28.233 --> 01:13:31.035
No, I do not, and I don't want
you using it on your crotch.

01:13:31.036 --> 01:13:32.436
She uses that one.

01:13:32.437 --> 01:13:34.238
I don't use any of
these on my crotch...

01:13:34.239 --> 01:13:36.874
But you can, they can
be used on your crotch.

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:38.543
No, these are for healing.
No, you would never do that.

01:13:38.544 --> 01:13:40.178
You would buy a vibrator, you
wouldn't use one of these.

01:13:40.179 --> 01:13:42.079
- These would not be comfortable.
- Where do we get a vibrator?

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.447
At The Porthole?

01:13:43.448 --> 01:13:45.616
Okay, why are you saying that?
It's The Portal.

01:13:45.617 --> 01:13:47.718
- What is it called?
- P-O-R-T-A-L.

01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:49.421
It has nothing to do with a hole.

01:13:49.521 --> 01:13:51.489
You can think of this as you.

01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:54.292
This would be your head,
this would be your body.

01:13:54.293 --> 01:13:55.904
There's your poontang, right there.

01:13:56.128 --> 01:13:57.295
The magician.

01:13:57.296 --> 01:13:58.896
No, my "flower" is
what I like to call it.

01:13:58.897 --> 01:14:01.265
She magicianed you.
Make my schmeckle disappear.

01:14:01.266 --> 01:14:05.469
She would, she doesn't like your
term, she prefers the term "flower."

01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:08.072
- Okay.
- Make him say that. Make him say it.

01:14:08.073 --> 01:14:12.688
I heard you say you don't
like the term "poontang."

01:14:12.878 --> 01:14:17.548
- And I agree with her.
- And, okay, okay, you prefer "flower."

01:14:17.549 --> 01:14:19.729
I would like to eat
your flower, honey.

01:14:21.653 --> 01:14:23.855
Okay, we'll work on that,
we'll work on that.

01:14:23.856 --> 01:14:25.690
Irving! Tell him how
to say that nicer.

01:14:25.691 --> 01:14:29.594
Okay, I would relish the chance...

01:14:29.595 --> 01:14:32.435
I would like to put relish
on your flower, honey.

01:14:32.464 --> 01:14:35.167
Okay, that's close enough,
'cause he wants to eat it up.

01:14:36.001 --> 01:14:37.702
I don't want relish on my flower.

01:14:37.703 --> 01:14:41.539
No, no. I said he would
relish, as in really enjoy.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:42.773
Oh, boy.

01:14:42.774 --> 01:14:44.475
Relish, as in really
enjoy the opportunity.

01:14:44.476 --> 01:14:46.611
- Yes.
- Won't that sting? It's very spicy.

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:49.881
Okay, no, no, no, no, we're not
putting relish on you anywhere.

01:14:49.882 --> 01:14:52.450
And your ultimate outcome card,

01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:56.053
if you can learn to use
your words differently.

01:14:56.054 --> 01:14:57.121
Right.

01:14:57.122 --> 01:15:00.091
- And to not be aggressively grabbing.
- This is the best pad.

01:15:00.092 --> 01:15:01.794
This is the best pad.

01:15:03.195 --> 01:15:04.996
Everything's gonna work for you.

01:15:04.997 --> 01:15:06.505
I get anal.

01:15:07.332 --> 01:15:09.300
- That's what she said. Yes.
- That's just what she said?

01:15:09.301 --> 01:15:10.668
I'm not saying...

01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:12.470
- Not you, the cards.
- ...and the cards are not saying...

01:15:12.471 --> 01:15:15.606
They're not saying that you
should have anal, okay?

01:15:15.607 --> 01:15:17.675
- What are, what...
- That's, they're saying that

01:15:17.676 --> 01:15:20.344
you're gonna have a
better relationship.

01:15:20.345 --> 01:15:22.113
That you're gonna be happier,

01:15:22.114 --> 01:15:24.595
- and he's gonna be happier.
- And, they're implying anal.

01:15:25.417 --> 01:15:28.419
I think what they're
suggesting is that if you...

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.888
- Oh, I'm sorry, they're suggesting anal.
- If you are willing...

01:15:30.889 --> 01:15:33.024
Yeah, I can never say do this
or don't do that.

01:15:33.025 --> 01:15:36.866
And if you tell him that you
don't like it, he will stop.

01:15:37.162 --> 01:15:39.196
- But if you like it...
- And then you try it again another time.

01:15:39.197 --> 01:15:41.001
- And if you like it...
- It's...

01:15:42.467 --> 01:15:45.403
We met the lady with the
crystals, who was very funny.

01:15:45.404 --> 01:15:48.016
And then we struck gold
with the card reader.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.509
We've just come in recent
contact with each other again,

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:56.113
and he would like to take our
relationship further, but, myself,

01:15:56.114 --> 01:15:58.182
I want to get him fixed
before we do that,

01:15:58.183 --> 01:16:04.388
because I don't want him bringing
his negative juju into my energy,

01:16:04.389 --> 01:16:06.034
my sexual energy field.

01:16:06.825 --> 01:16:08.834
You want to fix him?

01:16:09.094 --> 01:16:13.504
So I can knuckle up on her pilaf
and slip her the old butterfinger.

01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:18.146
Well, whatever, you know...

01:16:18.637 --> 01:16:21.147
Very lewd, he can
be a very lewd man.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.177
Well, he's a man.

01:16:25.077 --> 01:16:27.018
That's the way men are.

01:16:27.746 --> 01:16:29.948
Tell her what you said
you wanted last night.

01:16:31.516 --> 01:16:37.257
I told you that your pubic dandruff is
not doing my schmeckleheimer no favors.

01:16:37.489 --> 01:16:39.569
- That's what I told you.
- That's what he said.

01:16:41.193 --> 01:16:44.306
Well, are you a Jewish gentleman?

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:49.035
Well, I wasn't,
I was an accountant.

01:16:49.801 --> 01:16:54.572
So I changed my name to Zisman to
drum up more business, you know?

01:16:54.573 --> 01:16:56.343
- It just smelled like money.
- Oh.

01:16:57.042 --> 01:16:59.710
Oh, so you do have
a little Jewish in you.

01:16:59.711 --> 01:17:01.948
I'm trying to put a
little Jewish in her.

01:17:03.382 --> 01:17:06.117
Okay, you'd like for
her to get nasty.

01:17:06.118 --> 01:17:08.352
You'd like for her to get
nasty, wouldn't you?

01:17:08.353 --> 01:17:11.124
- I would love for her to get nasty.
- What does that mean?

01:17:11.656 --> 01:17:13.233
He wants to

01:17:15.594 --> 01:17:20.364
show you physically,
in the words...

01:17:20.365 --> 01:17:22.340
Throw it in your pickle schmear.

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.140
What is a pickle schmear?

01:17:27.205 --> 01:17:29.874
That's just, that's just his lingo.

01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:30.941
Oh, okay.

01:17:30.942 --> 01:17:32.443
It means the backdoor.

01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:33.884
Oh, okay.

01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:42.721
Now, I don't know where you're go...
I don't know why you need to go there.

01:17:43.622 --> 01:17:45.824
- Where?
- To the backdoor.

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:49.193
So, when I got up to
go to the bathroom,

01:17:49.194 --> 01:17:52.897
the card reader had
a real quiet talk with Spike,

01:17:52.898 --> 01:17:56.133
trying to determine
if he was a transvestite.

01:17:56.134 --> 01:18:01.807
You have a very feminine
side, and you have a very...

01:18:02.074 --> 01:18:04.375
You can do things
that men can do, too.

01:18:04.376 --> 01:18:05.576
Really, like what?

01:18:05.577 --> 01:18:10.453
Basically, what she
implied was, was I a man?

01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:15.252
And Gloria's very
sensitive about that.

01:18:15.253 --> 01:18:17.188
Gloria doesn't want
to be, like, Gloria...

01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:19.223
Gloria's very proud
of her femininity

01:18:19.224 --> 01:18:22.426
and even if she has certain
traits that are very masculine,

01:18:22.427 --> 01:18:23.894
- I think that's not...
- Like her dick?

01:18:23.895 --> 01:18:26.132
Like her dick.

01:18:30.969 --> 01:18:35.573
He has a... He talks about big butts a lot
and I'm gonna try and be light about that

01:18:35.574 --> 01:18:38.442
but it certainly
upsets me sometimes.

01:18:38.443 --> 01:18:43.388
I'm tired of magazines saying
flat butts are the thing.

01:18:44.249 --> 01:18:48.920
You know, you can do side bends or
sit-ups, but just don't lose that butt.

01:18:49.921 --> 01:18:52.727
Well, some people
just don't have one,

01:18:53.258 --> 01:18:57.702
so, you know, that doesn't mean
that we can't love them anyway.

01:18:57.929 --> 01:19:02.544
My anaconda don't want none
unless you got buns, hon.

01:19:06.738 --> 01:19:08.110
He's...

01:19:09.007 --> 01:19:10.808
What'd you say to me last night?

01:19:10.809 --> 01:19:12.488
I said, "Ladies."

01:19:13.078 --> 01:19:14.545
Yeah.

01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:16.248
- "Ladies."
- Yeah.

01:19:16.381 --> 01:19:19.858
- "If you wanna roll in my Mercedes..."
- Yeah.

01:19:20.452 --> 01:19:22.353
"You turn around..."

01:19:22.354 --> 01:19:24.221
- "And stick it out..."
- Yeah.

01:19:24.222 --> 01:19:28.495
"And even white boys gotta
shout, 'Baby's got back."'

01:19:31.296 --> 01:19:33.567
That just seems offensive
to me, though.

01:19:34.933 --> 01:19:36.510
You know...

01:19:39.204 --> 01:19:40.804
Ezra? No.

01:19:40.805 --> 01:19:43.508
- Irving.
- Irving, Irving.

01:19:43.508 --> 01:19:44.982
Ezra Pound.

01:19:45.677 --> 01:19:48.445
- You wanna bring out her softness.
- Yeah.

01:19:48.446 --> 01:19:50.814
Well, you have to appeal
to that softness.

01:19:50.815 --> 01:19:51.916
Yes.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:55.690
- And then you'll get what you want.
- Yes.

01:19:55.987 --> 01:19:58.522
You don't get it with
piss and vinegar.

01:19:58.523 --> 01:20:00.024
I'm not into watersports.

01:20:00.025 --> 01:20:05.299
No, no, no. You sound, you know,
your gruff, your approach sounds...

01:20:06.064 --> 01:20:07.538
I need to be more smooth.

01:20:08.033 --> 01:20:09.473
Exactly.

01:20:09.968 --> 01:20:11.235
I think you fixed him.

01:20:11.236 --> 01:20:14.371
I think you cured him and I
think if you want me to,

01:20:14.372 --> 01:20:17.576
and only if you want me to,
I will open up my backdoor.

01:20:17.676 --> 01:20:24.293
Well, if you feel comfortable
with that, then go for it.

01:20:25.317 --> 01:20:26.825
I'm scared, though.

01:20:27.552 --> 01:20:29.993
- Enjoy the ride.
- Okay.

01:20:34.125 --> 01:20:36.566
Oh, this is a nice hat.

01:20:42.334 --> 01:20:43.911
Suck a dick!

01:20:45.237 --> 01:20:46.570
Gross.

01:20:46.571 --> 01:20:48.216
Is this movie in 3-D?

01:20:54.579 --> 01:20:56.554
I gotta wax my bunghole?

01:21:00.552 --> 01:21:02.823
- Are you done?
- Not yet.

01:21:03.555 --> 01:21:09.426
Film him. That's our pile director,
hung-over every morning. Trashed.

01:21:09.427 --> 01:21:11.462
It's not a hangover anymore.
Now it's just the morning.

01:21:11.463 --> 01:21:13.074
It's just the morning?

01:21:13.231 --> 01:21:14.765
Cremation sounds
actually good for her.

01:21:14.766 --> 01:21:19.203
You get a little spark around
that dried-out old crotch of hers

01:21:19.204 --> 01:21:21.384
and it'll go up like
a fireworks stand.

01:21:22.941 --> 01:21:24.381
What'd I say?

01:21:25.143 --> 01:21:30.588
You okay, Javier?
Oh, he's laying a deuce.

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:34.427
Javier's laying a deuce.

01:21:34.886 --> 01:21:37.794
No, Karen, she's doing it.

01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:40.658
So, I ain't no pimp, but I know
how to seal some poontang.

01:21:40.659 --> 01:21:41.859
I need some poontang.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:43.368
You want black, white or Asian?

01:21:43.728 --> 01:21:45.305
All of the above.

01:21:45.363 --> 01:21:47.731
I don't know what time
it is. Do you have a...

01:21:47.732 --> 01:21:49.036
It's hammer time.

01:21:50.201 --> 01:21:52.002
Do you know what time it is?

01:21:52.003 --> 01:21:53.971
- I said it's hammer time.
- Okay, do you have a clock?

01:21:53.972 --> 01:21:55.981
- Grandpa!
- What?

01:21:58.109 --> 01:21:59.877
Oh, let me put these back in.

01:21:59.878 --> 01:22:03.082
Let me put my nuts in my
butt, one second, all right.

01:22:03.248 --> 01:22:04.722
Nice to meet you.

01:22:04.783 --> 01:22:05.916
Are you 21?

01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:08.859
- Yes. He's, he wants to go in the casino.
- Yes, I am, sir.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.789
You been smoking those
left-handed cigarettes, Javier?

01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:12.990
No, no, I haven't. No, I haven't.

01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:14.358
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:22:14.359 --> 01:22:15.592
There's types of the...

01:22:15.593 --> 01:22:17.136
- Smashy-smashy!
- Oh!

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.734
He's coming close.

01:22:31.743 --> 01:22:33.217
Child abuse!

01:22:37.882 --> 01:22:39.493
His Kryptonite is tickling.

01:22:40.251 --> 01:22:42.055
- You okay?
- You all right?

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.824
- What happened?
- Fuck you.

01:22:46.691 --> 01:22:52.466
So, Amanda is terrified of spiders and,
thank goodness, I just found a spider.

01:22:53.531 --> 01:22:56.109
I mean, this is a big old mama.

01:23:02.006 --> 01:23:04.049
Spider! Spider!

01:23:12.650 --> 01:23:14.693
Amanda, look at the spider.

01:23:16.688 --> 01:23:19.528
Amanda, look at the spider.
Look at the spider.

01:23:20.725 --> 01:23:23.838
Irving is gonna walk around the
corner and enter the building.

01:23:23.995 --> 01:23:27.733
And Chad here is helping
me stay dry from the rain.

01:23:35.874 --> 01:23:37.474
Am I gonna be on TV with this?

01:23:37.475 --> 01:23:40.121
No, it's a movie. It's a...

01:23:41.312 --> 01:23:42.820
That's even worse!

01:23:43.848 --> 01:23:47.029
Hey, stick with me, honey,
you'll be falling through silk.

01:23:47.685 --> 01:23:49.330
Fading through silk.

01:23:50.288 --> 01:23:51.522
Oh, my God!

01:23:51.523 --> 01:23:53.690
- I have something to tell you.
- Y'all don't do that crap.

01:23:53.691 --> 01:23:55.097
My name's not Gloria.

01:23:56.394 --> 01:23:57.902
My name's Roger.

01:24:01.599 --> 01:24:05.212
Whose D do I gotta S to get
another drink around here?

01:24:06.004 --> 01:24:08.472
Cordell, Cordell, Cordell.

01:24:08.473 --> 01:24:09.947
Hi, Santa!

01:24:10.074 --> 01:24:11.981
Sorry about that, Santy Claus.

01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:13.687
Lindsey, where's Lee?

01:24:13.912 --> 01:24:15.318
He's working.

01:24:16.514 --> 01:24:17.954
Oh, you fucker.

01:24:18.249 --> 01:24:20.326
Where's Lee going later?

01:24:23.755 --> 01:24:25.332
It's really gross.

01:24:27.091 --> 01:24:28.429
Hey, Derek?

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.561
That feels good, too.

01:24:30.562 --> 01:24:32.036
I'm sure.

01:24:32.797 --> 01:24:36.834
- Lick that dome good. Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah!

01:24:36.835 --> 01:24:38.635
Oh, my God!

01:24:38.636 --> 01:24:40.213
Oh, dude.

01:24:42.607 --> 01:24:44.980
Yeah, do you think
maybe too much booby?

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:46.980
Oh, you son of a...

01:24:49.781 --> 01:24:52.616
I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

01:24:52.617 --> 01:24:54.091
Oh, Spike, you suck.

01:25:03.628 --> 01:25:05.462
- You did great.
- That was insane.

01:25:05.463 --> 01:25:07.498
- You did awesome.
- That was agony!

01:25:07.499 --> 01:25:09.303
That was mayhem. It was mayhem.

01:25:17.742 --> 01:25:19.615
I got a whole lot of nothing!

01:25:20.311 --> 01:25:21.956
That's a wrap!

01:25:31.689 --> 01:25:33.027
All right!

01:25:35.827 --> 01:25:37.394
Let's go fishing!

01:25:37.395 --> 01:25:38.801
Yeah!

01:25:41.499 --> 01:25:43.042
Then to the bar!

01:25:48.873 --> 01:25:50.607
Taking this guy outta the car.

01:25:50.608 --> 01:25:51.875
That's fine.

01:25:51.876 --> 01:25:54.077
You're not gonna have him.
You're not going anywhere, dude.

01:25:54.078 --> 01:25:55.712
- All right.
- You ain't going anywhere.

01:25:55.713 --> 01:25:56.780
- All right.
- Promise you that.

01:25:56.781 --> 01:25:58.215
- You're not going anywhere.
- Okay. All right.

01:25:58.216 --> 01:25:59.895
You're not going anywhere.

01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:01.854
There's the cops right now.

01:26:02.787 --> 01:26:04.261
What the fuck?
