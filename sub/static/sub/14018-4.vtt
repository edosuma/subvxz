NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.083 --> 00:06.587
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.054 --> 00:08.863
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.922 --> 00:11.732
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.931
These are their stories.

00:15.162 --> 00:17.403
Does your wife
know you're single?

00:17.464 --> 00:19.068
(CHUCKLES) Come on,
I wouldn't lie to you.

00:19.132 --> 00:20.167
What's this?

00:20.233 --> 00:21.234
(SIGHS)

00:21.301 --> 00:22.575
it's a friendship ring.

00:22.636 --> 00:24.377
It's from a girl
I don't even see anymore.

00:24.438 --> 00:26.509
You know, you are so married,
you talk like your wife.

00:26.573 --> 00:27.574
Oh, come on.

00:27.641 --> 00:29.416
Tell your partner that he's...

00:29.476 --> 00:30.682
Help me, please!

00:30.744 --> 00:31.814
Save her!

00:31.878 --> 00:33.551
My wife. She's been shot.
She needs help.

00:33.613 --> 00:37.083
I've got to roll somebody.
I need people out here stat.

00:37.150 --> 00:39.221
WOMAN ON PA:
Dr. Nassuk, report to the E.R.

00:39.286 --> 00:41.698
Looks like a head shot!

00:41.755 --> 00:43.325
DOWNEY: What happened?
Please.

00:43.390 --> 00:46.200
Tell me what happened.
Please, save her. Save her, please!

00:47.227 --> 00:48.433
Please!

00:50.831 --> 00:53.641
Seven shots so far.
All from the outside.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.805
What'd they do?
Empty the whole clip?

00:55.869 --> 00:58.679
I guess somebody
really hated this car.

00:58.739 --> 01:00.741
This one did the damage.

01:01.508 --> 01:04.546
Downey, what do
we know about her?

01:04.611 --> 01:07.558
Nancy O'Neal, 29.
Her husband Marty brought her in.

01:07.647 --> 01:09.490
Had their little girl
with them. She's okay.

01:09.549 --> 01:10.823
How's the mom doing?

01:10.884 --> 01:12.420
Touch-and-go
last I checked.

01:12.486 --> 01:13.521
Where did
this happen?

01:13.587 --> 01:16.568
Near the G.W. Bridge,
near Cabrini and 180th.

01:16.623 --> 01:19.035
We got reports of
shots fired around 12:30.

01:19.092 --> 01:20.765
What's this decal?

01:21.895 --> 01:24.273
Permit for the
North Shore Beach Club.

01:24.331 --> 01:25.674
What, are they from
Long Island?

01:25.732 --> 01:28.645
Queens. He says he
manages that swim club.

01:28.702 --> 01:29.840
So, what were they
doing out here?

01:29.903 --> 01:31.849
They were driving home from her
parents' house in New Jersey.

01:31.905 --> 01:33.145
They got lost
coming off the bridge.

01:33.206 --> 01:34.378
Started driving
around in circles.

01:34.441 --> 01:36.387
Next thing you knows, somebody's
throwing shots at his car.

01:36.443 --> 01:37.478
What, just for
the hell of it?

01:37.544 --> 01:39.615
That's what he says.
He was inside.

01:39.679 --> 01:40.953
Thanks.

01:41.014 --> 01:43.221
Well, I can see
how this played out.

01:43.283 --> 01:44.626
He's driving, he's lost,

01:44.684 --> 01:48.154
she tells him to pull over, ask
for directions, he keeps driving.

01:48.221 --> 01:50.792
Or he did ask, and that's
the answer he got.

01:50.857 --> 01:53.463
That's why I always
carry a street map.

02:43.627 --> 02:45.038
She's still breathing.

02:45.095 --> 02:46.938
I told her husband we
got a patient who just

02:46.997 --> 02:49.204
ran the marathon
with a .22 in his head.

02:49.266 --> 02:50.802
Dr. Sunshine.

02:50.868 --> 02:53.109
Between you and me, she'll
be lucky to wake up.

02:53.170 --> 02:56.344
MARTY: I was just trying to get
back to the Cross Bronx Expressway.

02:57.608 --> 02:59.315
When I got down to
the end of the block,

02:59.376 --> 03:02.619
I made a U-turn and I drove
back the way we came.

03:03.947 --> 03:05.858
And that's when
all hell broke loose.

03:05.916 --> 03:09.295
Now, the guys that shot at you,
did they say anything to you?

03:09.353 --> 03:11.799
No.
You say anything to them?

03:11.855 --> 03:13.994
No. Nothing.
I swear to God.

03:15.459 --> 03:17.735
There were three of them

03:17.794 --> 03:21.264
and they just started
shooting for no reason.

03:22.666 --> 03:24.577
Thank God Bess was
asleep in the back seat.

03:25.535 --> 03:26.707
MRS. FULLER: Marty?

03:27.704 --> 03:31.584
My God. Bess.
What happened?

03:31.642 --> 03:33.883
Nancy got shot.

03:34.544 --> 03:39.323
I came around this way,
then I drove to about there.

03:39.383 --> 03:41.021
(OFFICERS CHATTERING ON RADIO)

03:41.084 --> 03:44.622
It was dark.
It looked different.

03:45.889 --> 03:47.334
The guys were
over there somewhere.

03:47.391 --> 03:50.429
Lennie! Found a shell
casing near the curb.

03:51.662 --> 03:53.335
Get back up
on the sidewalk.

03:53.397 --> 03:54.967
He's got more of them.

03:55.032 --> 03:56.306
You got more?

03:56.366 --> 03:57.367
Come over here.
Let me see.

03:58.535 --> 04:00.446
Come on.
Hand them over.

04:01.905 --> 04:03.942
Where'd you
pick these up?

04:04.541 --> 04:05.918
All right.

04:06.810 --> 04:09.154
So, is that where
those guys were standing?

04:09.212 --> 04:14.093
Yes. I took off.
I turned left down there.

04:15.619 --> 04:17.529
Can I get back to my wife?

04:17.620 --> 04:21.398
Officer! Run Mr.
O'Neal back to the hospital. Thank you.

04:22.359 --> 04:23.599

everybody who buys booze.

04:35.739 --> 04:38.117
This sale was
after you closed.

04:42.746 --> 04:44.657
Well, maybe
the clock's busted.

04:44.715 --> 04:46.956
And maybe you let
somebody in after hours.

04:47.317 --> 04:52.494
Tell you what, why don't we just
wait around, ask your boss?

04:53.457 --> 04:55.130
Don't do that.

Well, then quit jerking us around.

04:57.527 --> 04:58.972

bother nobody.

mind talking to us.

You sure it wasn't blue?

Washington Bridge.

these trajectories?

So far, they converge
at a point

06:10.734 --> 06:13.180
about 20 feet out
in front of the car.

06:13.236 --> 06:16.183
So, the car and the
shooter weren't moving.

Everybody was
standing still.

06:20.310 --> 06:22.620
Looks like the shot
came from this side.

06:22.679 --> 06:26.650
The shooter probably fired just as the
car was turning right to get away.

06:26.716 --> 06:29.162
Except O'Neal
could only turn left.

06:29.219 --> 06:30.960
Unless

06:32.923 --> 06:35.665
the door was open when
the shooting started.

06:35.725 --> 06:37.204
Marty left that part out.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.831
Yeah. He didn't tell us
the car was stopped either.

06:39.896 --> 06:42.240
Maybe because
he wasn't in the car.

06:42.299 --> 06:45.143
He shot his wife while his
kid's asleep in the back seat?

06:45.202 --> 06:48.274
Hey, you get mad enough, you
forget who's in the back seat.

06:53.343 --> 06:55.721
I was sleeping with Pooh.

06:55.779 --> 06:59.625
Then I heard noises,
like firecrackers.

06:59.683 --> 07:01.788
Did you see
where your daddy was?

07:01.852 --> 07:05.095
No. It was dark
and I was scared.

07:05.155 --> 07:07.795
And then Daddy
drove real fast.

before the firecrackers,

deserve it.

pick out the diamond.

to forget it.

before the party. (STUTTERS)

11:16.506 --> 11:18.247
They killed Nancy.

11:19.342 --> 11:20.912
Oh, my God.

11:21.778 --> 11:23.780
It's my fault.

11:25.148 --> 11:27.424
I should have
listened to her.

11:36.025 --> 11:38.733
We paged this guy Tony
and left O'Neal's number.

11:38.795 --> 11:39.933
No call back.

11:39.996 --> 11:41.805
Better luck paging the
Easter Bunny.

11:41.865 --> 11:44.038
I think
O'Neal's on the level.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.570
He said Tony drives a white Ford.
That's what the drunk saw.

11:47.637 --> 11:50.982
And we believe this liar
because a juice head says so?

11:51.040 --> 11:52.212
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

11:52.275 --> 11:53.811
I ran down
that beeper number.

11:53.877 --> 11:55.879
It's registered
to a Loretta Mason.

11:55.945 --> 11:58.323
She works at Ricky Reeds on 19th.

11:58.381 --> 12:00.361
Loretta? She sounds like
a lot of fun.

12:00.417 --> 12:03.057
Ask her how well
she knows Mr. O'Neal.

12:03.753 --> 12:08.133
Marty O'Neal? Sorry, Irish men
don't do anything for me.

12:08.191 --> 12:10.102
Well, how about
Italians named Tony?

12:10.160 --> 12:12.162
Oh, I know
a lot of Tonys.

12:12.228 --> 12:13.832
The one who got you
those rocks.

12:13.897 --> 12:15.774
His name was Irving.

12:15.832 --> 12:16.936
You mind if
I use your phone?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.206
Go ahead.

12:20.136 --> 12:22.810
Anyway, I lost that
pager three months ago.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.476
This one's much better.

12:24.541 --> 12:25.747
It vibrates.

12:26.009 --> 12:27.750
My boyfriend's
a real sweetie.

12:27.811 --> 12:30.519
Sometimes he pages me
for no reason at all.

12:30.613 --> 12:33.287
What? You lose your pager and you
don't bother to cancel the account?

12:34.017 --> 12:35.690
I paid a year's
service in advance.

12:35.752 --> 12:37.026
They weren't going
to give me a refund.

12:37.086 --> 12:40.158
So what the heck, let the guy who
stole it get my money's worth.

12:40.223 --> 12:41.725
(PHONE RINGING)

12:41.991 --> 12:44.699
Ricky Reeds.
Good afternoon.

12:44.794 --> 12:47.798
Loretta? Yeah. She's here.
Who should I say is calling?

12:48.331 --> 12:50.333
Tony? Just a moment.

12:51.768 --> 12:53.805
I paged him and
gave him this number.

12:53.870 --> 12:56.043
There's a coffee shop
right down the street.

12:56.105 --> 12:58.312
You tell him that you're
going to meet him outside.

12:58.374 --> 13:00.115
You got that, Loretta?

13:05.381 --> 13:06.587
Baby, what's the problem?

13:06.649 --> 13:08.356
Tony, I'm sorry.
They made me do it.

13:08.418 --> 13:10.659
You're a tough guy
to get a hold of, Tony.

13:12.422 --> 13:15.335
Whoa! Easy!
Look, I wasn't on Cabrini Boulevard.

13:15.391 --> 13:17.337
I don't know
any Marty O'Neal.

13:17.393 --> 13:18.633
That's personal property.

13:18.695 --> 13:21.073
Yeah, right. From
your family estate, huh?

13:21.130 --> 13:22.268
One last time, Tony.

13:22.332 --> 13:23.936
Friday night.
Cabrini Boulevard.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.308
I wasn't there.

13:25.368 --> 13:26.745
Don't lie to the police.

13:26.803 --> 13:29.716
Okay! Look, I was there, okay?
But Marty never showed.

13:29.772 --> 13:31.217
And what's it got
to do with you guys?

13:31.274 --> 13:34.949
You don't read the papers?
His wife got shot on Cabrini.

13:35.011 --> 13:36.752
I only saw the headlines.
That was his old lady?

13:38.181 --> 13:39.285
Oh, man.

13:39.983 --> 13:41.656
I had a feeling
about those guys.

13:41.718 --> 13:42.958
What guys are those?

13:43.019 --> 13:45.625
When I was waiting for O'Neal,
these three guys come along,

13:45.688 --> 13:47.599
and one was showing the
other two a big silver gun.

13:48.091 --> 13:49.502
I was holding
nine diamond rings.

13:49.559 --> 13:50.663
I wasn't going
to stick around.

13:50.727 --> 13:51.831
What did these
guys look like?

13:51.895 --> 13:54.637
Guy with the gun was big, and
the other two were smaller.

13:54.697 --> 13:57.041
And one had short
blond hair. Dominicans.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.102
What? They were wearing
the national costume?

13:59.168 --> 14:00.374
They were drinking
Barahona,

14:00.436 --> 14:01.574
Dominican beer.

14:01.638 --> 14:03.549
Nobody else
drinks that crap.

14:03.606 --> 14:04.949
I saw them come out
of this little club.

14:05.008 --> 14:06.009
What club?

14:06.075 --> 14:10.114
This Dominican place, in a basement
around the corner from 180th.

14:24.961 --> 14:26.668
This is a private club.
Yeah.

14:26.729 --> 14:29.005
We're looking for
three of your members.

14:29.065 --> 14:30.738
They were here Friday,
around midnight.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.280
Big man with two other guys.
One had blond hair.

14:34.070 --> 14:35.447
I don't want any trouble.

14:35.505 --> 14:36.848
BRISCOE: Neither do we.

14:36.906 --> 14:38.943
And we know your liquor
license isn't posted

14:39.008 --> 14:41.511
because it's out someplace
being framed, right?

14:41.578 --> 14:45.253
Look, these guys shot a woman
four blocks from here, Friday.

14:45.315 --> 14:47.727
They came this close to
killing her little girl.

14:52.755 --> 14:54.029
(TOILET FLUSHING)

14:57.226 --> 15:00.571
Put your hands on your head, now!
Get down on your stomach.

15:00.630 --> 15:01.973
Do it!
it's dirty, man.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.942
Get down on the floor!

15:06.035 --> 15:07.241
I get all dirty here, man.

15:07.604 --> 15:08.878
What are you
complaining about?

15:08.938 --> 15:10.440
We're the ones
who have to smell you.

15:10.773 --> 15:12.377
Come on. Get up.

15:14.310 --> 15:17.723
The bartender said Leo was there
Friday, with his brother, Victor.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.657
She said they were
drinking with a third guy.

15:19.716 --> 15:21.457
Thinks his name was Eli.

15:21.517 --> 15:23.224
Description fits
what the fence told us.

15:23.286 --> 15:26.392
Well, this bartender earned her
club a little police protection.

15:26.456 --> 15:29.096
Say hello to Victor Ramos,
Leo's brother.

15:29.158 --> 15:31.900
Victor here declines to
cooperate with the authorities.

15:31.961 --> 15:34.100
VAN BUREN:
Put him in Room B.

15:34.163 --> 15:37.337
We tossed their place.
No gun, but I found their phone book.

15:38.267 --> 15:42.215
Under the letter "E",
Elias Camacho.

15:42.271 --> 15:43.272
Prefix in the Bronx.

15:50.246 --> 15:53.386
He's not here.
Why do you want him?

15:53.449 --> 15:55.360
We're arresting him,
Mrs. Camacho.

15:55.418 --> 15:58.797
What, again? You arrested him
two days ago, on Saturday.

15:58.855 --> 16:00.300
He's not here.
I told you that.

16:00.356 --> 16:05.533
He's in Rikers jail.
He was caught selling drugs.

16:05.595 --> 16:07.404
Don't you know that?

16:09.999 --> 16:11.603
Routine buy and bust.

16:11.668 --> 16:14.581
This lame ass, Camacho, could
only sell me eight balloons.

16:14.637 --> 16:16.878
I tell him I need 50.
(SCOFFS)

16:16.939 --> 16:19.681
Punk gets scared, lifts his
shirt, shows me he's strapped.

16:19.742 --> 16:21.153
What's it look like to you?

16:21.210 --> 16:23.212
Nickel plate, .
380 Brownie, I figure.

16:23.279 --> 16:24.519
We're going
to need that gun.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.617
I'd love to have
it to give to you.

16:26.683 --> 16:28.321
He says he's going to
get me the 50 balloons.

16:28.384 --> 16:29.761
Backup unit lost him.

16:29.819 --> 16:32.095
By the time we collared
him, the gun was gone.

16:32.155 --> 16:34.032
Are you sure it was a .38
0? Uh-huh.

16:34.090 --> 16:37.594
If you want to know where it is,
you're going to have to ask him.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.105
ROSS: This case will never
make without the gun.

16:39.162 --> 16:42.109
But the fence lD'd Camacho
from a photo array.

16:42.165 --> 16:44.839
The bartender said he was
drinking with the Ramos brothers.

16:44.901 --> 16:46.505
Did O'Neal
ID any of them?

16:46.569 --> 16:47.946
No.
For what it's worth,

16:48.004 --> 16:50.575
Camacho probably doesn't
even know he killed anybody.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.142
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have flashed that gun

16:52.208 --> 16:53.585
to an undercover
the next morning.

16:53.643 --> 16:54.747
What, he doesn't
watch the news?

16:54.811 --> 16:57.189
He got locked up before
the news hit the street.

16:58.881 --> 17:01.418
Which A.D.A. caught
the drug bust?

17:01.484 --> 17:02.792
Charlie Harmon. I know him.

17:03.486 --> 17:05.625
Are the Ramos brothers
still in holding? Uh-huh.

17:05.688 --> 17:07.133
Keep them there.
Lose their paperwork.

17:07.190 --> 17:10.103
If Camacho doesn't know about the
murder, I don't want them telling him.

17:10.159 --> 17:13.435
You never call, you never write,
but when you want a favor...

17:13.496 --> 17:15.874
You sound like my mother, Charlie.
This is important.

17:15.932 --> 17:17.707
Money never
changed hands, Jamie.

17:17.767 --> 17:18.801
The case is a loser.

17:18.867 --> 17:19.938
What do you
want with it?

17:20.002 --> 17:21.106
Camacho's a murder suspect.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.843
I need the gun
he was carrying.

17:22.905 --> 17:25.351
A murder case?

17:25.407 --> 17:28.048
I could use some R&R
from the war on drugs.

17:28.111 --> 17:30.648
I would kill to be second
chair in a murder trial.

17:30.713 --> 17:32.351
I'm second chair.

17:32.415 --> 17:33.689
Say, "I'll do my best."

17:33.750 --> 17:35.252
On the next one.

17:36.252 --> 17:37.731
Thanks.

17:37.787 --> 17:39.198
You're welcome.

17:41.491 --> 17:42.993
(DOOR BUZZING)

17:46.429 --> 17:49.638
I'm sorry. Mr. Sutter, hi.
I'm Jamie Ross.

17:49.699 --> 17:51.303
I'm just playing catch-up,
here.

17:51.367 --> 17:54.439
Mr. Harmon was busy.
He just dumped all this into my lap.

17:54.570 --> 17:55.640
Oh!

17:56.205 --> 17:57.582
Well, you'll see
it's a very weak case.

17:58.107 --> 17:59.950
Don't get your hopes up.

18:00.843 --> 18:02.550
Why do you think Harmon
laid it off on you?

18:03.446 --> 18:04.584
(SIGHS)

18:05.047 --> 18:08.620
I see your client had eight
heroin balloons on him

18:08.684 --> 18:09.822
when he was arrested.

18:10.419 --> 18:11.659
It was for his
own personal use.

I'm not that green,
Mr. Sutter.

18:15.591 --> 18:17.628
I'd like to
work with you.

18:18.561 --> 18:20.871
The police say you showed a gun
to the undercover officer.

18:20.930 --> 18:21.965
I don't have no gun.

18:22.031 --> 18:24.136
ROSS: Nickel-plated, semi-automatic.

18:24.367 --> 18:26.142
I'd like to come out
of this looking good.

The mayor has this
"Guns Off The Street" program.

18:28.271 --> 18:29.750
Maybe you heard of it?

18:29.806 --> 18:33.219
You turn in your gun, we reduce the
drug charge to simple possession.

18:33.276 --> 18:34.755
Time served.
A year's probation.

18:35.111 --> 18:36.215
No weapons charge.

18:36.279 --> 18:37.758
No weapons charge.

18:37.814 --> 18:39.794
With reduced bail, he
could be out by tonight.

18:39.982 --> 18:41.290
(CHUCKLES)

18:41.350 --> 18:43.591
it's a good deal,
Mr. Camacho.

18:46.489 --> 18:49.095
Okay.
I'll tell you where the gun is.

18:49.525 --> 18:50.833
(GUN FIRING)

18:52.962 --> 18:55.135
The action's
a little rough.

18:55.198 --> 18:58.008
Mr. Camacho ought to clean
his weapon more often.

18:58.067 --> 19:00.274
I'll mention it to him.

19:00.336 --> 19:03.545
You know, these people have no
respect for their instruments.

19:03.606 --> 19:07.110
I mean, that's a beautiful piece
of American craftsmanship.

19:07.176 --> 19:09.713
Feel the finish
on the walnut stock.

19:09.779 --> 19:12.589
It caresses the hand
like a woman's thigh.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.990
Yeah, a big selling
point for Camacho.

19:16.786 --> 19:19.596
This is the slug
from your victim's head.

19:21.424 --> 19:24.667
Now, I'm looking at two projectiles
fired from the same gun.

19:26.062 --> 19:28.406
No question.
That's your murder weapon.

19:28.464 --> 19:32.002
Then we better roll. Camacho just made
bail on that reduced dope charge.

19:32.068 --> 19:33.775
He's going to be leaving
Rikers in an hour.

19:33.836 --> 19:35.076
Thanks.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.550
I'm going to miss my
bus, man, what's up?

19:39.609 --> 19:41.611
Elias Camacho?
Yeah?

19:41.677 --> 19:43.486
You're under arrest.
Turn around.

19:43.546 --> 19:44.616
Hey, what the hell, man?

19:44.680 --> 19:46.489
That bitch promised
me no charges, man!

19:46.549 --> 19:48.722
This is for the murder
of Nancy O'Neal.

19:48.784 --> 19:50.422
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:50.486 --> 19:53.365
Anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

19:53.489 --> 19:54.934
You have the right to
an attorney...

19:55.260 --> 19:56.603
SUTTER: She submarined us,
Your Honor.

19:57.062 --> 19:59.975
She didn't tell us my client was a
suspect in a murder investigation!

20:00.031 --> 20:02.272
Mr. Camacho knew he'd
used the gun in a shooting.

20:02.334 --> 20:03.711
If he's dumb enough
to hand it over...

20:03.768 --> 20:05.111
It was bad faith.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.150
We gave him a year's
probation on the drug charge

20:07.205 --> 20:08.445
and a walk on
the weapons charge.

20:08.506 --> 20:09.780
We're standing by the deal.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.345
She lied to us, Your Honor.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.516
Did you, Ms. Ross?

20:13.578 --> 20:14.784
Not exactly, Your Honor.

20:15.213 --> 20:18.092
Anyway, the courts have allowed the
police to use deceit to obtain evidence.

20:18.149 --> 20:22.063
The police. I expect more from
an Assistant District Attorney.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.388
Whatever the reason,

20:23.455 --> 20:26.197
Mr. Camacho turned over the
gun on the advice of counsel

20:26.257 --> 20:27.600
and of his own free will.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.605
His rights weren't violated.
Your Honor.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.696
SCHREIBER: Mr. Sutter,

20:30.762 --> 20:33.140
the law is on
Ms. Ross' side.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.278
Your motion to
suppress is denied.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.977
And you, I'm not happy with.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.017
I'm sending a note to
the ethics committee,

20:41.072 --> 20:43.985
and then I'm going
to talk to Adam Schiff.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.857
Camacho alone is
responsible for this crime.

20:50.915 --> 20:53.555
It was his gun.
Only his prints were on it.

20:53.618 --> 20:55.325
Which is why Mr.
Ramos and his brother

20:55.387 --> 20:57.025
are only charged
with facilitation.

20:57.088 --> 21:01.628
Leo has applied for legal immigration.
He has a clean record.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.132
He'd like to
keep it that way.

21:06.664 --> 21:09.668
He testifies against Camacho,
we drop the charge.

21:12.103 --> 21:13.446
(SIGHS)

21:14.439 --> 21:17.613
Camacho was pointing
the gun at everything.

21:17.675 --> 21:19.916
We told him,
"Don't be stupid."

21:20.812 --> 21:25.261
And then this Ford comes by, and
this white guy's checking us out.

21:25.316 --> 21:28.593
And he stops and he
gets out of the car.

21:28.653 --> 21:30.792
Camacho says he wants
to scare the white guy,

21:31.489 --> 21:32.968
so he shoots at the car.

21:33.691 --> 21:35.898
The white guy drives off.
Camacho's laughing.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.066
Me and my brother,
we get scared. We run away.

21:40.698 --> 21:43.577
We didn't know about
nobody getting hurt.

21:46.037 --> 21:47.846
The other brother
confirmed the story.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.977
Camacho just wanted
to scare O'Neal away.

21:50.408 --> 21:52.854
It doesn't matter.
He shot into an occupied car.

21:52.911 --> 21:55.414
It's depraved indifference.
it's still murder.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.686
I'll have the brothers
sign their statements,

21:56.748 --> 21:58.284
then I'll write up
their dismissal note.

21:58.349 --> 21:59.453
Good.

22:02.887 --> 22:03.991
Jack.

22:05.523 --> 22:07.434
Nancy O'Neal's
hospital chart.

22:07.725 --> 22:11.969
It says she was in the O.R.
prepped for organ retrieval at 11:22.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.071
So?

22:15.333 --> 22:17.870
Here, check the time of death
on her death certificate.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.108
11:55.

22:22.173 --> 22:23.550
They were getting ready
to take her organs out

22:23.608 --> 22:25.588
half an hour before
she was declared dead?

22:27.078 --> 22:28.284
Clerical error.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.849
She was dead when the bullet
turned her brain to mush.

22:32.050 --> 22:35.554
I'd hate for Camacho to be acquitted
on a dumb clerical error.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.163
(SIGHS)

22:38.523 --> 22:40.628
Who signed the
death certificate?

22:40.758 --> 22:42.066
Maybe I signed it at 11:55,

22:42.127 --> 22:44.835
but she was brain dead a
good half hour before that.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.311
We're going to need her exact
time of death, Dr. Hsu.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.243
I don't have
the exact time.

22:50.301 --> 22:52.747
We have to tell
the jury something.

22:52.804 --> 22:54.181
Look, she failed the
apnea test,

22:54.239 --> 22:55.946
then she was brought into the O.R.

22:56.107 --> 22:57.313
The apnea test?

22:57.609 --> 22:59.316
Once the patient's
brain function ceases,

22:59.377 --> 23:00.913
we take her
off the ventilator.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.617
If she can't breathe
on her own for one minute,

23:02.680 --> 23:03.886
then she's brain dead.

23:03.948 --> 23:05.427
That's what happened
to Nancy O'Neal?

23:05.750 --> 23:06.854
Yes.

23:07.752 --> 23:11.325
Who else would've noted
her actual time of death?

23:11.389 --> 23:14.233
Ask Dr. Cosgrove.
He was in charge of the organ retrieval.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.329
I'm just the neurosurgeon.

23:18.763 --> 23:19.798
(CAR ALARM BEEPING)

23:19.864 --> 23:22.208
There were seven surgeons in O.
R., Ms. Ross.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.974
If you've never seen
an organ retrieval,

23:24.035 --> 23:26.743
it's like a sale
at Loehmann's.

23:29.007 --> 23:31.078
Please, use my car.
Thanks.

23:31.142 --> 23:32.780
Once it starts, there's
no time for taking notes.

23:32.844 --> 23:34.016
That's what
nurses are for.

23:34.078 --> 23:35.989
I'm talking about
before the retrieval began.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.152
Don't you have the time
she failed her apnea test?

23:38.216 --> 23:39.661
It's on her chart.
Yes.

23:40.852 --> 23:43.128
11:20.
That's the time of death.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.393
Because that's when Dr.
Hsu said she was brain dead?

23:45.623 --> 23:48.536
Right. When a neurosurgeon
says you're dead, you're dead.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.073
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting to go to.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.075
It was nice
talking to you.

23:53.565 --> 23:57.479
She wasn't declared dead until
they were about to cut her open?

23:57.835 --> 23:58.905
That's terrific.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.040
It's a technicality.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.448
She was dead when she
failed the breathing test.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.714
And their expert
will say otherwise.

24:04.776 --> 24:08.223
You don't want the jury scratching
their heads going into deliberations.

24:08.279 --> 24:09.849
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

24:10.048 --> 24:11.652
Camacho's lawyer's
been calling.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.059
He's looking to make a deal.

24:13.117 --> 24:14.255
Good. Call him back.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.224
Because of some
sloppy record-keeping?

24:16.454 --> 24:18.627
Half a loaf, Counselor.
Better than nothing.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.299
We'll take man
one for 10 years.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.265
10-to-20.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.102
20-to-life,
on murder two.

24:31.569 --> 24:32.775
(LAUGHS)

24:33.037 --> 24:35.313
With the Ramos brothers saying
he didn't mean to kill anybody?

24:35.607 --> 24:36.779
The jury won't care.

24:37.175 --> 24:39.086
SUTTER: We'd settle
for 12-and-a-half-to-25.

24:45.216 --> 24:46.354
You have a deal.

24:46.417 --> 24:47.657
I can do 12, no sweat.

24:47.719 --> 24:48.925
Quiet, Elias.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.961
(EXHALES) That was too easy.
What's the catch?

24:53.491 --> 24:57.098
You've got eyewitnesses,
ballistics, the murder weapon.

24:57.161 --> 24:59.869
Fingerprints. I mean, someone
slip happy pills in your coffee?

25:00.465 --> 25:02.911
The deal's on the table
for another 30 seconds.

25:03.334 --> 25:05.575
I got bent over a chair by Ms.
Ross before.

25:05.637 --> 25:08.550
Now I'm getting another tingling
sensation in my butt. Why is that?

25:09.974 --> 25:11.282
Wishful thinking?

25:12.310 --> 25:13.846
Your time is up,
Mr. Sutter.

25:13.911 --> 25:15.288
Come on, man,
make the deal.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.753
That's what
they'd like us to do.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.729
I want to see everything
you've got.

25:22.854 --> 25:26.233
I want to see statements,
police reports, everything.

25:26.357 --> 25:28.303
Then we can talk
about a deal, okay?

25:28.993 --> 25:30.199
Come on.

25:35.833 --> 25:38.746
This minor record-keeping glitch, as Mr.
McCoy keeps calling it,

25:38.803 --> 25:40.874
means my client
didn't kill Nancy O'Neal.

25:40.938 --> 25:42.417
That's nonsense, Your Honor.

25:42.473 --> 25:45.920
What's pertinent here is when
she failed the apnea test.

25:46.377 --> 25:47.617
That's when
she was brain dead.

25:47.679 --> 25:48.885
SUTTER: According to whom,
Your Honor?

25:48.946 --> 25:51.358
Dr. Hsu, the neurosurgeon who
signed her death certificate.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.952
Did he tell
Mr. McCoy or Ms. Ross

25:53.017 --> 25:54.655
that he administered
the apnea test?

25:54.719 --> 25:57.222
He told me Mrs. O'Neal
failed the apnea test.

25:57.288 --> 25:58.858
SUTTER: Because someone
told him she did.

25:58.923 --> 26:00.300
In fact,
he wasn't even there.

26:00.391 --> 26:04.100
According to his affidavit, the test was
administered by a Dr. Donald Cosgrove,

26:04.162 --> 26:05.971
outside the presence
of a neurosurgeon

26:06.030 --> 26:07.703
and in violation
of medical protocol.

26:07.965 --> 26:09.774
Mrs. O'Neal was
technically alive

26:09.834 --> 26:11.472
when they began
harvesting her organs.

26:11.669 --> 26:13.876
That's what
caused her death.

26:14.038 --> 26:15.415
Not my client.
JACK: Your Honor,

26:15.673 --> 26:18.950
Mr. Sutter can wave the death
certificate around all he wants.

26:19.110 --> 26:22.580
The fact is his client fired a
bullet into Mrs. O'Neal's brain.

26:22.947 --> 26:24.790
That's why she failed
the apnea test.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.221
That's why she
was declared dead.

26:27.819 --> 26:31.528
And that's why I'm going to deny
your motion to dismiss, Mr. Sutter.

26:31.856 --> 26:34.837
Your Honor, the fact that my
client didn't kill Mrs. O'Neal...

26:34.892 --> 26:36.872
SCHREIBER:
Is for a jury to decide.

26:37.161 --> 26:39.072
You can present this
evidence at trial.

26:39.897 --> 26:41.308
We're done.

26:41.599 --> 26:44.409
I didn't lie, Ms. Ross.
You just never asked.

26:44.469 --> 26:45.812
You lied by omission.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.146
You let me assume you
conducted that apnea test.

26:48.439 --> 26:49.975
You assumed
at your own risk.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.282
You falsely signed
an official document.

26:53.277 --> 26:56.451
She was dead when I signed
her death certificate.

27:00.752 --> 27:03.062
I told you to
talk to Cosgrove.

27:05.289 --> 27:07.565
I took his word
she failed the test.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.466
I'm sorry.

27:18.403 --> 27:19.814
(SIGHS)

27:20.772 --> 27:22.217
I screwed up, Jack.

27:22.673 --> 27:23.947
I heard what
I wanted to hear.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.682
I heard what I wanted to hear, too.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.625
We're going to need
Cosgrove's testimony.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.557
Talk to him.
Make sure we're in sync.

27:33.618 --> 27:37.225
An RN, Judy Paxton, made the
notation on the O'Neal chart,

27:37.288 --> 27:41.236
but I don't see that she was present when Dr.
Cosgrove did the test.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.363
Then I should really
talk to Dr. Cosgrove.

27:43.428 --> 27:46.739
Yes. Do you have his number
at Hudson Medical Center?

27:46.798 --> 27:48.744
He doesn't
work here anymore?

27:48.800 --> 27:50.336
His last day was Friday.

27:50.868 --> 27:52.506
He took everybody by surprise.

27:52.570 --> 27:55.210
Was he facing disciplinary
action here over the apnea test?

27:55.273 --> 27:57.480
No. He was going to
leave sooner or later.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.078
Thanks to our
insurance company,

27:59.143 --> 28:02.488
Woodward will be out of the heart
transplant business by the end of the year.

28:02.547 --> 28:03.958
There are just
too many risks.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.619
Dr. Cosgrove
must've been disappointed.

28:05.683 --> 28:09.495
I doubt it. If you're a heart
man, Hudson is the place to be.

28:10.588 --> 28:13.535
I called Hudson Medical Center,
Cosgrove wasn't available.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.435
His assistant said he's too
busy settling into his new job.

28:16.494 --> 28:18.974
Hudson? Didn't they get some
of Nancy O'Neal's organs?

28:19.030 --> 28:21.101
They put her heart and lungs
in a high school student.

28:21.165 --> 28:23.907
According to his assistant,
Cosgrove hand-carried the organs

28:23.968 --> 28:25.504
and assisted
in the transplant.

28:25.570 --> 28:26.844
(SCOFFS)

28:26.904 --> 28:30.181
Sounds more like he was
arranging a job transplant.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.219
The senior administrator
at Woodward Hospital said

28:32.276 --> 28:34.916
he's been sending out his
resume for the past six months.

28:34.979 --> 28:38.051
No takers. He was pricing himself
right out of the market.

28:38.316 --> 28:39.693
Until Hudson came along.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.024
They're among the
top ten in the country.

28:41.085 --> 28:42.428
They can afford him.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.797
How fortunate
for Dr. Cosgrove.

28:48.526 --> 28:51.097
The notion that Hudson
Medical had a quid pro quo

28:51.162 --> 28:53.540
with Dr. Cosgrove
is ridiculous.

28:53.598 --> 28:55.100
We don't barter for organs.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.573
So it's just
a coincidence?

28:56.634 --> 28:59.945
Yes. Cosgrove is a first-rate doctor.
That's the reason he's here.

29:00.338 --> 29:03.046
You're aware there was no neurologist
at the donor's apnea test,

29:03.107 --> 29:04.450
the one he says she failed?

29:04.509 --> 29:05.647
No, I didn't know that.

29:06.310 --> 29:08.085
I'm sure
there's an explanation.

29:08.145 --> 29:09.886
Dr. Cosgrove
hasn't provided one.

29:10.181 --> 29:11.216
Hmm.

29:11.282 --> 29:13.626
This transplant was very
important for your hospital.

29:13.985 --> 29:16.727
Every transplant is,
especially to the patient.

29:16.787 --> 29:18.460
The girl had
Eisenmenger's syndrome,

29:18.523 --> 29:21.436
literally days away from death
when Cosgrove came through.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.233
I meant financially.

29:23.294 --> 29:24.329
Oh.

29:24.395 --> 29:26.841
I read that Hudson recently had
its Center of Excellence rating

29:26.898 --> 29:28.571
renewed by Medicare.

29:28.633 --> 29:29.771
That's right.

29:29.834 --> 29:32.144
Doesn't that mean that Medicare
will help defray the costs

29:32.203 --> 29:33.944
of organ retrievals
and heart transplants?

29:34.005 --> 29:36.918
Yes.
You've done your research.

29:36.974 --> 29:39.250
And that rating is
predicated on the number

29:39.310 --> 29:42.348
of successful transplants performed each year.
Including this one.

29:43.781 --> 29:45.260
I see where you're going.
Good.

29:45.616 --> 29:47.618
What did Dr.
Cosgrove promise you with regards to

29:47.685 --> 29:49.460
Nancy O'Neal's
heart and lungs?

29:50.421 --> 29:53.231
I think I better have a talk
with our in-house counsel.

29:53.324 --> 29:56.168
Fine. And after him, you can
talk to the grand jury.

29:57.662 --> 30:00.108
There was another matching
donor in Virginia.

30:00.398 --> 30:02.708
We were on the phone with
them and with Cosgrove.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.370
Waiting to see
who would die first.

30:05.903 --> 30:07.382
Yes.

30:07.438 --> 30:10.817
Cosgrove guaranteed me he could
deliver a heart-lung block.

30:14.020 --> 30:17.297
I made the notation in her chart because Dr.
Cosgrove told me to.

30:17.557 --> 30:19.195
I wasn't there for the test.

30:19.258 --> 30:21.101
Was anyone
besides Cosgrove?

30:21.160 --> 30:22.730
He said Dr. Hsu was.

30:22.795 --> 30:24.331
Look, he was
chief of the floor.

30:24.397 --> 30:26.570
If he'd told me Elmer Fudd
had witnessed the test,

30:26.632 --> 30:28.737
that would
be okay with me.

30:29.235 --> 30:32.307
Ms. Paxton, do you believe
she failed the test?

30:32.605 --> 30:34.915
(SIGHS)
I don't know anymore.

30:34.974 --> 30:37.955
I was there the first two times
Cosgrove and Hsu tested her.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.148
She passed.

30:39.212 --> 30:42.591
An hour later, Cosgrove told me
they tested her again, she failed.

30:42.648 --> 30:45.254
He ordered five milligrams of Vec
and told me to get her to the O.R.

30:45.318 --> 30:47.457
Vec, what's that?
Vecuronium.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.830
They give it to organ
donors before harvesting

30:49.889 --> 30:51.835
to stop any postmortem
muscle spasms.

30:52.091 --> 30:53.365
It paralyzes them?

30:53.993 --> 30:55.267
Head to toe.

30:55.962 --> 30:59.341
Cosgrove declares her dead and
then kills her with a blow dart.

30:59.398 --> 31:01.469
So now he's your murderer,
not Camacho?

31:01.534 --> 31:04.037
Cosgrove had the motive,
to advance his career,

31:04.103 --> 31:06.947
plus he had the means
and the opportunity.

31:07.640 --> 31:13.113
And the man who put a bullet in
Nancy O'Neal's brain goes home?

31:13.479 --> 31:14.958
Public won't be happy.

31:15.014 --> 31:16.618
They're both liable
for her death.

31:16.682 --> 31:18.218
In this room, not in court.

31:19.352 --> 31:23.892
The doctor's intentional intervening
act negates Camacho's liability.

31:24.290 --> 31:27.897
Camacho acted with depraved
indifference when he fired at the car.

31:28.494 --> 31:30.997
He sent Nancy O'Neal to the hospital,

31:31.063 --> 31:33.441
in a coma with
a bullet in her brain.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.838
That she might die there,
for whatever reason,

31:37.303 --> 31:39.647
including Cosgrove's
intentional act,

31:39.705 --> 31:41.707
was a foreseeable consequence
of shooting her.

31:41.774 --> 31:46.223
Foreseeable? If she'd died of a
heart attack on an operating table,

31:46.913 --> 31:49.325
that would be a
foreseeable consequence.

31:49.382 --> 31:51.191
And if it had
been malpractice?

31:52.084 --> 31:54.291
Isn't that also
a foreseeable consequence?

31:54.353 --> 31:55.423
ADAM: What's your point?

31:55.488 --> 31:57.593
Malpractice isn't that
far from what Cosgrove did.

31:57.657 --> 31:59.261
It doesn't let
Camacho off the hook.

31:59.559 --> 32:00.629
I see.

32:00.693 --> 32:04.038
Are you gonna hold the jury's
hand to make the leap?

32:04.530 --> 32:06.134
I'll hold both their hands.

32:07.900 --> 32:11.245
I'll tell you, if either
conviction survives an appeal,

32:11.304 --> 32:12.510
I'll buy a new hat.

32:12.572 --> 32:13.744
Let them appeal.

32:14.407 --> 32:17.149
Five years from now, they
might get a new trial,

32:17.210 --> 32:18.951
which I'll be
glad to prosecute.

32:19.011 --> 32:21.218
For now, this is
the right thing to do.

32:28.588 --> 32:32.730
"Docket number 558806,
People v. Donald Cosgrove,

32:32.792 --> 32:34.237
"Murder in the Second Degree."

32:34.293 --> 32:37.331
Your Honor, my client's already been arraigned.
What is he doing here?

32:37.396 --> 32:39.603
Let me get a plea.
Mr. Cosgrove?

32:39.665 --> 32:42.202
Doctor. Not guilty.

32:42.268 --> 32:43.372
TORLEDSKY: Bail, Ms. Ross?

32:43.436 --> 32:45.643
$500,000 on the doctor,
Your Honor,

32:45.705 --> 32:47.378
and status quo
for Mr. Camacho.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.010
I'm sorry.
I still don't see why we're here.

32:49.075 --> 32:52.079
People request the cases against Mr.
Camacho and Dr. Cosgrove

32:52.144 --> 32:53.851
be consolidated.
On what grounds?

32:53.913 --> 32:55.859
The people allege they
both killed Nancy O'Neal.

32:55.915 --> 32:57.326
What? Me and this gangster?

32:57.383 --> 33:00.421
Your Honor, Dr.
Cosgrove is a respected surgeon.

33:00.486 --> 33:01.726
Enough.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.959
Elias Camacho
remains remanded.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.936
Bail is set for Donald
Cosgrove at $500,000.

33:06.993 --> 33:09.030
Now go yell
at somebody else.

33:09.161 --> 33:12.233
SUTTER: They're not co-conspirators,
they're not accomplices.

33:12.531 --> 33:14.408
They acted independently
of each other, Your Honor.

33:14.901 --> 33:16.312
Now, if the
doctor killed her,

33:16.369 --> 33:19.248
there's no legal basis to charge Mr.
Camacho with her murder.

33:19.305 --> 33:20.648
In People v. Stewart,

33:20.706 --> 33:22.811
a stabbing victim died
on the operating table

33:22.875 --> 33:25.651
because of a medical error
unrelated to the wound.

33:25.878 --> 33:28.381
The court ruled that
the doctor's intervening act

33:28.447 --> 33:30.723
did not nullify the
assailant's responsibility.

33:30.783 --> 33:32.126
And if I may observe,
Your Honor,

33:32.184 --> 33:34.994
that in Stewart the doctor
was never even charged.

33:35.054 --> 33:37.534
Because that doctor made
an honest medical mistake.

33:37.590 --> 33:40.400
There's nothing honest about what
your client did to Nancy O'Neal.

33:40.493 --> 33:43.337
Your Honor, I don't know what these
lawyers think they know about medicine...

33:43.396 --> 33:44.875
Donald, please.
No, really.

33:44.931 --> 33:47.741
I saved the life of a
16-year-old girl that night.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.312
And to be lumped in with this
street scum is beyond anything...

33:50.369 --> 33:52.212
Doctor, that's enough.

33:52.271 --> 33:55.741
Now you'd be advised to let your
lawyer do the talking. Hmm?

33:57.677 --> 33:59.554
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

33:59.712 --> 34:00.918
Your Honor,
the People's evidence

34:00.980 --> 34:02.653
simply doesn't
support the allegations.

34:02.715 --> 34:05.525
Which makes this an issue
of fact for a jury to decide.

34:05.584 --> 34:06.585
Your Honor.
Your Honor.

34:06.652 --> 34:09.188
Gentlemen, please.
Ms. Ross is right.

34:10.255 --> 34:13.668
Since there's enough here to sustain
charges against both defendants,

34:14.493 --> 34:16.699
I'm going to let
a jury sort it out.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.214
MARTY: After I brought
Nancy in,

34:24.270 --> 34:27.274
the emergency doctor
told me she was critical,

34:27.572 --> 34:29.246
but that she
might pull through.

34:29.675 --> 34:32.315
JACK: Did Dr. Cosgrove
talk to you?

34:32.378 --> 34:33.947
Yes.

34:34.647 --> 34:36.320
He kept coming by.

34:37.550 --> 34:40.326
I was sitting next
to Nancy in the ICU.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.724
He examined her,

34:43.022 --> 34:46.469
then said I should expect her
to die in a short while.

34:46.625 --> 34:50.630
JACK: Mr. O'Neal, what did you expect
the hospital to do for your wife?

34:53.199 --> 34:54.507
It's a hospital.

34:55.234 --> 34:59.444
These doctors were supposed
to help her, to save her life.

35:02.408 --> 35:03.887
Not kill her.

35:05.711 --> 35:07.384
No more questions.

35:09.648 --> 35:11.855
Mr. O'Neal,
just to be clear,

35:12.651 --> 35:15.097
when you brought your wife
to Woodward, she was alive?

35:16.022 --> 35:18.366
Yes. Absolutely.

35:18.724 --> 35:20.294
Thank you.

35:21.861 --> 35:23.966
After your wife was shot,

35:24.764 --> 35:27.210
did she ever
regain consciousness?

35:28.501 --> 35:29.878
No.

35:31.070 --> 35:32.344
She was in a coma.

35:32.972 --> 35:34.645
But they told me
she might get better.

35:34.707 --> 35:35.811
Might?

35:37.676 --> 35:43.149
Didn't you have a lengthy consultation
that evening at 8:47 with Dr. Hsu

35:43.215 --> 35:46.321
who told you that your
wife was near brain dead?

35:46.685 --> 35:49.256
That she would never be aware
of her surroundings again?

35:49.688 --> 35:52.692
Yes. He told me she was
close to brain death.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.637
But what does he know?

35:55.694 --> 35:57.571
I mean, I could see she
was breathing on her own.

35:57.630 --> 35:59.109
Move to strike.

35:59.165 --> 36:02.476
Mr. O'Neal is not qualified to assess
the condition of a comatose patient.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.014
It doesn't take
an expert to know

36:04.070 --> 36:05.606
when someone's
breathing, Your Honor.

36:05.671 --> 36:07.446
Sit down, Mr. McCoy.

36:08.007 --> 36:09.350
The jury will disregard.

36:09.408 --> 36:10.478
MARTY: Why?

36:11.310 --> 36:13.119
She was alive, Judge.

36:14.013 --> 36:15.321
My wife was alive.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.224
SCHREIBER: Mr. O'Neal, please.

36:17.583 --> 36:20.120
You're to respond
only to the questions.

36:20.753 --> 36:21.823
Mr. Hilburne.

36:21.887 --> 36:23.594
Nothing more, Your Honor.

36:27.159 --> 36:29.469
HSU: I was on a phone consultation
with a doctor in Queens,

36:29.528 --> 36:32.031
when I got called to
the O.R. by Dr. Cosgrove.

36:32.865 --> 36:35.744
He told me Mrs. O'Neal
had failed the apnea test.

36:35.801 --> 36:38.645
He asked me to sign the
death certificate. I did.

36:39.271 --> 36:42.275
I shouldn't have, but
by then it was too late.

36:43.008 --> 36:46.114
You signed it even though
you didn't witness the test?

36:46.178 --> 36:48.852
Aren't you admitting that
you violated medical protocol?

36:49.715 --> 36:50.750
Yes.

36:50.816 --> 36:53.763
Making you subject to
professional sanctions?

36:54.286 --> 36:55.492
Yes.

36:55.554 --> 36:57.295
Thank you.
No more questions.

36:59.125 --> 37:01.127
No questions, Your Honor.

37:02.328 --> 37:04.069
HILBURNE:
You had six other patients

37:04.130 --> 37:07.043
with brain injuries in the ICU
that day, is that correct?

37:07.099 --> 37:08.544
HSU: Yes, that sounds right.

37:08.601 --> 37:13.573
Well, do you remember that day
a patient named Roberto Lopez?

37:13.639 --> 37:15.915
47-year-old Hispanic male,
aortic aneurysm.

37:15.975 --> 37:17.113
Yes, now I remember.

37:17.176 --> 37:20.555
I signed a brain death notice
for him that afternoon.

37:20.613 --> 37:24.425
And do you recall how many apnea
tests he underwent that day?

37:24.550 --> 37:25.654
I'd have to check.

37:25.718 --> 37:27.288
His chart says four.

37:27.786 --> 37:29.993
But of those tests,
how many did you witness?

37:30.422 --> 37:32.368
I'm not sure.
Another neurosurgeon,

37:32.424 --> 37:34.461
Dr. Koblin, might've
witnessed one of them.

37:34.693 --> 37:36.900
The chart says you
were present for two.

37:36.962 --> 37:38.032
Then that's what it is.

37:38.097 --> 37:39.872
How about
Francine Waters, black,

37:39.932 --> 37:41.912
pulmonary edema?
She had three tests.

37:41.967 --> 37:43.605
Were you present
for all of them?

37:43.669 --> 37:44.704
I don't recall.

37:44.770 --> 37:46.078
Her chart says you were.

37:46.138 --> 37:49.642
Just as Nancy O'Neal's chart says
you were there for her last test.

37:49.708 --> 37:50.982
Yes, but I wasn't.

37:51.043 --> 37:52.351
How can you be sure?

37:52.411 --> 37:54.220
I wasn't there.
Why would I lie?

37:55.114 --> 37:56.889
I don't know, Doctor.

37:56.949 --> 37:58.895
Maybe it's
professional jealousy?

37:59.151 --> 38:01.358
Maybe my client has a better
parking spot than you.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.366
Objection.
Withdrawn.

38:04.356 --> 38:06.029
No more questions.

38:12.264 --> 38:17.270
Last year, Cosgrove bought a house
in Sands Point from a judge's widow.

38:18.103 --> 38:21.277
$1.3 million.
That's a big nut to carry.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.321
Locks down his
financial motive.

38:24.577 --> 38:27.751
Might not make any difference.
Dr. Hsu's a wash.

38:28.280 --> 38:32.524
In the win column, we have the
ballistics expert, the Ramos brothers.

38:33.285 --> 38:34.628
Marty O'Neal's a toss-up.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.327
So we've got a good chance
of convicting Camacho,

38:37.389 --> 38:38.766
and slim-to-none on Cosgrove?

38:38.824 --> 38:40.303
Put yourself in
the jury's shoes.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.770
Camacho blew
a woman's brains out.

38:41.827 --> 38:44.000
That's an easy
concept to grasp.

38:44.129 --> 38:46.131
All the rest of it,
brain death, apnea tests.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.337
I get a headache
just thinking about it.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.243
Aspirin's in
the top right drawer.

38:52.137 --> 38:55.607
Jack, Nancy O'Neal was, for all
intents and purposes, dead.

38:55.674 --> 38:57.915
She was breathing.
On her own.

38:58.877 --> 39:01.756
That's life, as far as the State
of New York is concerned.

39:01.814 --> 39:03.054
But what kind of a life?

39:03.115 --> 39:04.287
It doesn't matter.

39:04.683 --> 39:08.153
This was not a mercy killing,
it was murder for profit.

39:17.096 --> 39:19.508
Jamie, can dead people
feel pain?

39:19.865 --> 39:24.041
(CHUCKLES) Trick question?
The word "dead" speaks for itself.

39:24.103 --> 39:25.582
Look at this.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.816
COSGROVE:
Mrs. O'Neal was near death.

39:35.881 --> 39:38.054
Her husband had given
a "do not resuscitate" order.

39:38.117 --> 39:39.892
We were waiting for her
to die.

39:39.952 --> 39:41.192
HILBURNE: What did you do?

39:41.253 --> 39:43.130
We performed
a third apnea test.

39:43.188 --> 39:44.895
We took her
off the ventilator.

39:44.957 --> 39:47.597
She stopped breathing.
She was brain dead.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.406
When you say "we,"
who do you mean?

39:50.462 --> 39:52.533
Myself and Dr. Hsu.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.237
I can't understand
why he doesn't remember.

39:55.301 --> 39:56.507
But I do.
He was there.

39:56.835 --> 40:00.112
HILBURNE: After Mrs.
O'Neal failed the test, what did you do?

40:00.172 --> 40:01.617
COSGROVE: I put her
back on the ventilator.

40:01.674 --> 40:05.212
Then, I told Nurse Paxton to make a note
in her chart and to prep her for the O.R.

40:06.478 --> 40:07.980
And what happened there?

40:08.047 --> 40:10.254
A team of surgeons
harvested her organs.

40:10.683 --> 40:12.959
Her heart and her lungs went
to a high school student.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.898
Her kidneys went to
California and to Arkansas,

40:16.355 --> 40:18.767
and her corneas
went to Chicago.

40:19.958 --> 40:21.596
Thanks to
Mrs. O'Neal's gifts,

40:21.660 --> 40:26.040
a half a dozen people now
lead normal, healthier lives.

40:26.565 --> 40:28.909
Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.118
No questions.

40:38.344 --> 40:42.349
Doctor, we heard testimony that you
guaranteed Hudson Medical Center

40:42.414 --> 40:46.021
you'd have a heart-lung block
for them to transplant.

40:46.085 --> 40:47.393
They misunderstood.

40:47.453 --> 40:49.023
And now you're
working at Hudson.

40:49.521 --> 40:52.866
You'd been wanting to leave Woodward
for some time, isn't that true?

40:52.925 --> 40:54.632
Yes. Their insurance
company is forcing them

40:54.693 --> 40:56.297
to stop doing
heart transplants.

40:56.462 --> 40:58.635
You'd applied to other hospitals?
Yes.

40:58.764 --> 41:01.506
And you'd been turned down because
of your salary demands, correct?

41:01.567 --> 41:02.910
I really couldn't say.

41:02.968 --> 41:06.108
Your monthly financial
obligations are substantial.

41:06.171 --> 41:09.345
Alimony, child support
for two kids,

41:09.408 --> 41:12.048
payments on a condo
in the city,

41:12.111 --> 41:16.082
a home in Sands Point,
two luxury cars...

41:16.148 --> 41:17.855
Yes, yes.

41:17.916 --> 41:19.862
You need that big
paycheck, don't you?

41:19.918 --> 41:23.661
And Hudson Medical Center was the only
hospital willing to meet your price.

41:23.722 --> 41:25.133
Yes.

41:25.190 --> 41:27.500
If you delivered a heart-lung
block to them that night.

41:27.559 --> 41:31.837
No, that is ridiculous.
They hired me because of my qualifications.

41:31.897 --> 41:35.435
Doctor, we've heard testimony
from several neurologists

41:35.501 --> 41:38.539
that Nancy O'Neal would
have survived her injuries.

41:38.604 --> 41:40.777
Well, they're wrong.
The fact is, she did not survive.

41:40.839 --> 41:43.115
She failed the apnea test.
She was dead.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.184
Brain dead?
Yes.

41:46.245 --> 41:48.156
You're absolutely sure?

41:52.451 --> 41:54.897
According to the medical
standards that we live by,

41:54.953 --> 41:57.229
yes, there's no question
that she was dead.

42:02.694 --> 42:04.139
People's 79.

42:06.231 --> 42:11.579
An itemized bill for Nancy O'Neal's
stay at Woodward Hospital.

42:12.438 --> 42:17.751
It includes all charges incurred
during the organ harvest.

42:18.710 --> 42:23.386
Doctor, there's an item highlighted.
Please tell us what it says.

42:26.785 --> 42:28.594
It's a morphine drip.

42:29.288 --> 42:31.029
What's it used for?

42:31.089 --> 42:32.397
It's a painkiller.

42:36.361 --> 42:39.137
You were giving
Nancy O'Neal a painkiller

42:39.198 --> 42:41.542
while you were
harvesting her organs?

42:41.600 --> 42:42.943
No.

42:46.972 --> 42:50.181
This is a mistake.
it's not on her hospital chart.

42:51.810 --> 42:54.313
You're right, it isn't.

42:59.051 --> 43:01.964
But we checked with
the hospital dispensary.

43:04.957 --> 43:06.368
People's 80.

43:07.759 --> 43:11.229
According to their records,
you signed out a morphine drip

43:11.296 --> 43:14.675
10 minutes before Nancy O'Neal
was wheeled into the O.R.

43:14.733 --> 43:16.838
Isn't that what this says?

43:22.241 --> 43:23.549
Yes.

43:26.111 --> 43:29.581
Why would a person you were
absolutely sure was brain dead

43:29.648 --> 43:30.922
need a painkiller?

43:30.983 --> 43:32.860
She wouldn't. She didn't.

43:32.918 --> 43:35.228
Because if she were as
dead as this piece of wood,

43:35.287 --> 43:37.631
she wouldn't feel any pain,
isn't that right?

43:37.689 --> 43:38.724
She was dead.

43:38.790 --> 43:39.962
She was alive.

43:40.025 --> 43:41.231
For all your
godlike pronouncements,

43:41.293 --> 43:42.636
you knew that, didn't you?
HILBURNE: Objection!

43:42.694 --> 43:45.300
That's why you had to
pump her full of morphine!

43:45.364 --> 43:46.900
So she wouldn't bolt upright,

43:46.965 --> 43:49.707
screaming in the operating room
while you cut her heart out.

43:49.768 --> 43:51.270
(GAVEL POUNDING)
Mr. McCoy.

44:02.981 --> 44:04.892
I have nothing further.

44:13.825 --> 44:16.203
Man one,
1 2-and-a-half-to-25?

44:18.397 --> 44:21.469
Jack, you've got to
take into consideration

44:21.533 --> 44:23.410
the quality of the life
that was taken.

44:23.468 --> 44:25.812
I don't make
those distinctions.

44:26.772 --> 44:29.981
Murder two, 15-to-life.
Or we go back to the jury.

44:42.154 --> 44:44.293
Done. Send me
the paperwork.

44:44.923 --> 44:46.402
Mr. McCoy,

44:48.927 --> 44:52.136
if you had seen
her lying there,

44:53.165 --> 44:55.111
there was no
hope of recovery.

44:55.567 --> 44:58.605
She was either going to
die then or 10 days later.

44:59.104 --> 45:01.584
It wasn't your decision
to make, Doctor.

45:03.475 --> 45:04.647
Donald.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.716
Of course it was.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.366
Cosgrove confused his own
needs with his patient's.

45:24.463 --> 45:25.874
He got arrogant.

45:25.931 --> 45:29.037
An occupational
hazard of people

45:29.101 --> 45:30.739
with the power
over life and death.

45:30.802 --> 45:31.906
Like doctors.

45:31.970 --> 45:36.077
Prosecutors.
One guilty plea, one guilty verdict.

45:36.875 --> 45:39.913
Good work.
And good night.

45:40.479 --> 45:41.617
(CHUCKLES)

45:47.285 --> 45:50.823
Tomorrow, we start on Camacho's
sentence recommendation.

45:52.190 --> 45:54.136
There's gonna be
some fallout from this.

45:54.192 --> 45:57.105
People are gonna think twice
before signing their donor cards.

45:57.329 --> 45:59.138
Cosgrove was an aberration.

46:00.165 --> 46:02.406
I'm not worried about
a shortage of organs.

46:02.467 --> 46:04.276
Better not be.

46:04.803 --> 46:06.476
Especially livers.

46:07.439 --> 46:09.077
Good night, Jack.
