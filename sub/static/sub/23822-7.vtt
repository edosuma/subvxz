Okay, well...
peace out again.

12:21.780 --> 12:23.950
Quinn, Gary can't leave.

12:23.985 --> 12:25.254
Let him do what he wants.

12:25.255 --> 12:27.820
Every time you go it alone,
it ends in failure.

12:27.855 --> 12:30.360
You need everyone
on this crew to succeed.

12:30.395 --> 12:32.560
Until you accept that,
you have no chance.

12:32.595 --> 12:35.230
But I don't need them ...
especially Gary.

12:35.265 --> 12:37.100
He's impetuous, irresponsible,

12:37.135 --> 12:39.030
and he takes nothing seriously.

12:39.065 --> 12:42.800
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
You haven't figured it out yet.

12:47.780 --> 12:51.464
I guess it's plan "B."

I can save my dad.

12:57.085 --> 12:59.624
- Did you just call me dad?
- Did I just call you what?

13:01.660 --> 13:04.320
Surprised myself, frankly,
but it is what it is.

13:04.330 --> 13:06.860
H.U.E., where are
my civilian clothes?

13:06.895 --> 13:09.260

13:09.295 --> 13:11.200

What about KVN?

13:12.765 --> 13:15.400
<i> KVN is a jag-off, Gary.
You know that.</i>

13:15.435 --> 13:16.974
Yeah, I do know that, actually.

13:16.975 --> 13:19.210
Yeah. KVN was sent just
to ruin everything he touches!

13:19.245 --> 13:20.574
He's the complete opposite of Midas.

13:20.575 --> 13:21.844
Turdas ... That's KVN.

13:21.845 --> 13:25.950
One touch, everything in life
turns into one long, slender turd.

13:25.985 --> 13:26.914

Chocli!

13:26.915 --> 13:28.314
What ... how ... hey!

13:28.315 --> 13:31.337
Hello. Hi. [Chuckling]
You caught me

13:31.338 --> 13:34.324
at a highly naked
pantsless time.

13:34.325 --> 13:36.620
- Chocli. Buk, buk, buk.
- Dang it!

13:36.655 --> 13:39.030
Do you know how long it's been
since we've been together?

13:39.065 --> 13:42.090
- Five, eight minutes?
- More like 20 years.

13:42.100 --> 13:46.100
- I lost you. My you.
- That sucks for your you.

13:46.135 --> 13:47.734
Wah!
Whoa!

13:47.735 --> 13:49.640
I'm on the mattress.
Good Lord, you are strong.

13:49.675 --> 13:52.300
Oh, this has been fantastic.
And you're crawling on top.

13:52.310 --> 13:53.944
Okay, wait, you know what,
I-I-I gotta say

13:53.945 --> 13:56.110
I'm more of
a wine and dine kind of lad.

13:56.145 --> 13:58.580
Even a cracker and some water
would go a long way with me,

13:58.615 --> 14:02.110
'cause I mean ... Can we please,
uh, get to the subject ...

14:02.120 --> 14:05.120
the subject matter here is
that there's a Quinn thing!

14:05.155 --> 14:06.484
I am Quinn.

14:06.485 --> 14:08.450
I mean my Quinn.
Don't get me wrong.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.860
Tomorrow's Quinn is super hot
and freakishly strong,

14:10.895 --> 14:13.260
but in a more tomorrow's
freakishly strong

14:13.295 --> 14:14.894
and hot kind of way.

14:14.895 --> 14:15.964
[Device chimes]

14:15.965 --> 14:17.800
All right.
I got what I need.

14:17.835 --> 14:19.535
Goodbye, Gary.

14:20.330 --> 14:23.009
Energy cuffs? [Chuckles]
You are sassy.

14:23.010 --> 14:25.810
We're playing goodbye
with energy cuffs.

14:25.845 --> 14:27.940
What the hell
is going on here?!

14:27.975 --> 14:31.140
It seems like you walked into
a situation, Quinn,

14:31.150 --> 14:32.982
- where the two of us ...
- "Us?!"

14:33.017 --> 14:35.280
Oh, no, no, no, no!
This is not us.

14:35.315 --> 14:36.584
But she's you.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.089
- He's right.
- No, he's not!

14:38.090 --> 14:39.524
- I think I am.
- I am you.

14:39.525 --> 14:40.854
But I'm not doing that.

14:40.855 --> 14:44.560
This naked bed stuff
really wasn't much of a ...

14:44.595 --> 14:46.430
- Shut up, Gary!
- I'm confused.

14:46.465 --> 14:48.900
I am not.
I am strangely aroused.

14:48.935 --> 14:51.180
- Me, too!
- Didn't know that could happen.

14:51.215 --> 14:53.471
Feels weird.

14:53.506 --> 14:56.640
- Get over here!
- I was done anyway.

14:56.675 --> 14:59.170
Cut the crap, Nightfall.
I want answers.

14:59.205 --> 15:01.040
I was trying to save the universe.

15:01.075 --> 15:02.744
By handcuffing Gary naked?

15:02.745 --> 15:05.180
I don't want him to see
what's happening next.

15:07.085 --> 15:10.520

before he destroys all of us.

15:10.555 --> 15:12.189
What are you talking about?

15:12.190 --> 15:15.320
Do you know what's about
to happen to Gary?

15:15.355 --> 15:17.320

15:17.330 --> 15:19.460

<i>Something inside Mooncake snaps.</i>

15:22.000 --> 15:23.860
<i>Mooncake lays waste to the universe</i>

15:23.870 --> 15:26.670
