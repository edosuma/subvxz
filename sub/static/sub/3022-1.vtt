03:06.603 --> 03:09.272
How does it feel to be back
on the Enterprise Bridge?

03:09.356 --> 03:10.857
Captain Kirk?

03:10.941 --> 03:13.442
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- Did you participate in the redesign?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.820
We'd like to know how you feel
about being on...

03:15.904 --> 03:19.824
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.410
There will be plenty of time
for questions later.

03:22.494 --> 03:25.621
I'm Captain John Harriman,
and I'd like to welcome you all aboard.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.832
- It's our pleasure.
- I just want you to know

03:27.958 --> 03:29.542
how excited we all are

03:29.793 --> 03:33.713
to have a group of living legends
with us on our maiden voyage.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.383
I remember reading about your missions
when I was in grade school.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.593
Really?

03:41.013 --> 03:45.600
- Well, may we have a look around?
- Please, please.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.977
Yes, sir,
it's very nice to finally meet you.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.981
- Demora!
- Excuse me. Captain?

03:52.190 --> 03:54.483
This is the first Starship Enterprise
in 30 years

03:54.568 --> 03:57.528
without James T. Kirk in command.
How do you feel about that, sir?

03:57.613 --> 03:59.822
Just fine. I'm glad to be here
to send her on her way.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.658
And what have you been doing
since you retired?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.201
Keeping busy.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.037
Captain Kirk,
just a few more questions, sir.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.498
Why don't we give the Captain
a chance to look around first?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.593
Captain. Excuse me.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.724
I'd like you to meet the helmsman
of the Enterprise-B. Demora.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.560
Ensign Demora Sulu.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.523
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.027
My father's told me
some interesting stories about you.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.155
- Your father is Hikaru Sulu?
- Yes, sir.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.325
- You've met her before, but she was...
- It wasn't that long ago.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.078
- It couldn't have been more than...
- Twelve years, sir.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.288
- Twelve years?
- Absolutely.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.874
Incredible.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.709
Congratulations, Ensign.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.963
It wouldn't be the Enterprise
without a Sulu at the helm.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.047
Thank you, sir.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.466
I'm sure Hikaru must be
very proud of you.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.051
I hope so.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.223
I was never that young.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.560
No, you were younger.

05:15.565 --> 05:19.860
- Damn fine ship if you ask me.
- Scotty, it absolutely amazes me.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.238
And what would that be, sir?

05:23.198 --> 05:26.534
Sulu, when did he find time for a family?

05:26.827 --> 05:27.827
Well, like you always say,

05:27.911 --> 05:30.204
if something's important,
you make the time.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.083
So that's why you seem so restless.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.502
Finding retirement a little lonely,
are we?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.171
You know, I'm glad you're an engineer.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.508
With tact like that,
you'd make a lousy psychiatrist.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.847
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if you'll take your seats.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.350
Yes, of course.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.019
Prepare to leave spacedock.

05:53.103 --> 05:57.023
Aft thrusters ahead one-quarter,
port and starboard at station keeping.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.858
- Captain Kirk.
- Yes?

05:58.942 --> 06:01.694
I'd be honored if you'd give the order
to get underway.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.365
- Thank you very much, I...
- Please, sir.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.285
- No, no, no, no.
- Please, I insist.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.254
Take us out.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.223
- Very good, sir.
- Brought a tear to me eye.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.641
Be quiet.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.579
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.873
Now that you've seen
the rest of the ship,

06:55.999 --> 06:57.750
how does it feel to be back?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.169
- Well, we... Fine.
- Fine, fine.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.505
- Fine, fine.
- Well, ladies and gentlemen,

07:02.631 --> 07:04.673
we've just cleared the asteroid belt.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.259
Our course today will take us out
beyond Pluto

07:07.344 --> 07:10.596
and then back to spacedock.
Just a quick run around the block.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.641
Captain, will there be time to conduct
any tests on the warp drive system?

07:15.143 --> 07:17.895
We're picking up a distress call,
Captain.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.484
On speakers.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.612
This is the transport ship Lakul.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.448
We're caught
in some kind of energy distortion.

07:29.533 --> 07:34.120
Two ships in our convoy... trapped
in a severe gravimetric distortion.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.081
We can't break free.
We need immediate help.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.876
It's tearing us apart.
This is the transport...

07:41.503 --> 07:43.087
The Lakul is one of two ships

07:43.213 --> 07:44.922
transporting El-Aurian refugees
to Earth.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.550
Ensign Sulu, can you locate them?

07:47.926 --> 07:51.554
The ships are bearing
at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.014
Distance, three light-years.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.563
Signal the closest starship.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.399
We're in no condition
to mount a rescue.

08:06.069 --> 08:10.614
- We don't even have a full crew aboard.
- We're the only one in range, sir.

08:17.080 --> 08:21.876
Well, then, I guess it's up to us.

08:22.419 --> 08:27.047
Helm, lay in an intercept course
and engage at maximum warp.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.716
Aye, sir.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.309
Captain, is there something wrong
with your chair?

08:46.776 --> 08:50.362
We're within visual range
of the energy distortion, Captain.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.782
On screen.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.955
What the hell is that?

09:01.499 --> 09:04.001
I've located the transport ships.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.797
Their hulls are starting to buckle
under the stress.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.467
They won't survive much longer.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.806
We're encountering severe
gravimetric distortions

09:17.891 --> 09:20.142
from the energy ribbon, Captain.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.897
We'll have to keep our distance.
We don't wanna get pulled in, too.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.317
- Tractor beam. Tractor beam.
- We don't have a tractor beam.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.611
You left spacedock
without a tractor beam?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.155
It won't be installed until Tuesday.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.908
Ensign Sulu,

09:38.912 --> 09:41.664
try generating a subspace field
around the ships.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.457
That might break them free.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.668
There's too much quantum interference,
Captain.

09:45.752 --> 09:50.089
What about... What about
venting plasma from the warp nacelles?

09:50.173 --> 09:52.007
That might disrupt the ribbon's hold
on the ships.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.052
Aye, sir. Releasing drive plasma.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.180
It's not having any effect, sir.
I think the ribbon's hold...

09:58.265 --> 10:01.850
Sir, the starboard vessel's hull
is collapsing!

10:06.940 --> 10:12.444
- How many people were on that ship?
- Two hundred and sixty-five.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.746
Sir, the Lakul's hull integrity
is down to 12%.

10:30.714 --> 10:35.384
Captain Kirk, I would appreciate
any suggestions you might have.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.929
First, move us within transporter range.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.514
Beam those people
aboard the Enterprise.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.434
What about the gravimetric distortions?
They'll tear us apart.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.562
Risk is part of the game
if you wanna sit in that chair.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.564
Helm, close to within transporter range.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.733
Second, turn that damn thing off!

10:57.574 --> 10:59.992
- We're within range, sir.
- Beam them directly to Sickbay.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.078
- Aye, sir.
- How big is your medical staff?

11:03.413 --> 11:06.749
The medical staff?
It doesn't arrive till Tuesday.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.502
You and you,
you've just become nurses. Let's go.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.340
Main Engineering reports fluctuations
in the warp plasma relays.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.051
Sir, I'm having trouble
locking on to them.

11:17.135 --> 11:20.262
They appear to be
in some sort of temporal flux.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.430
Scotty!

11:24.309 --> 11:25.684
What the hell?

11:25.769 --> 11:29.897
Their life signs are phasing in and out
of our space-time continuum.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.607
Phasing? To where?

11:31.941 --> 11:35.611
- Sir, their hull's collapsing!
- Beam them out of there, Scotty!

11:41.785 --> 11:44.286
Transport complete.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.294
I got 47

11:53.963 --> 11:55.964
out of 150.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.106
- Report!
- We're caught in a gravimetric field

12:12.190 --> 12:14.274
emanating from the trailing edge
of the ribbon.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.735
All engines, full reverse!

12:21.825 --> 12:25.244
It's going to be all right.
We're going to help you.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.745
We are going to help you.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.540
- It's okay. Everything is fine.
- My wife...

12:29.666 --> 12:31.500
Why? Why?

12:32.335 --> 12:34.920
It's all right. You're safe.
You're on the Enterprise.

12:35.004 --> 12:38.924
- No, no, I have to go. I have to go back.
- You need to stay right here.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.051
- No. You don't understand.
- It's okay.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.762
Let me go back. Let me go back!

12:43.847 --> 12:48.267
Let me go back.
Let me go back. Please!

12:51.229 --> 12:53.939
- What was he talking about?
- I have no idea.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.858
Excuse me.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.280
Can I help you?

13:04.284 --> 13:09.746
It's going to be okay. You'll be all right.
You just need to rest. Come over here.

13:14.586 --> 13:19.006
There's just no way to disrupt
a gravimetric field of this magnitude.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.301
- Hull integrity at 82%.
- But I do have a theory.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.886
I thought you might.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.889
An antimatter discharge directly ahead

13:27.140 --> 13:30.559
might disrupt the field long enough
for us to break away.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.227
- Photon torpedoes.
- Aye.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.395
We're losing main power.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.647
Load torpedo bays.
Prepare to fire at my command.

13:35.732 --> 13:40.569
- Captain, we don't have any torpedoes.
- Don't tell me, Tuesday.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.157
- Hull integrity at 40%.
- Captain, it may be possible

13:45.241 --> 13:46.950
to simulate a torpedo blast

13:47.076 --> 13:50.329
using a resonance burst
from the main deflector dish.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.625
- Where are the deflector relays?
- Deck 15, Section 21-Alpha.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.169
I'll go. You have the Bridge.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.425
Wait.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.846
Your place is on the bridge of your ship.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.183
I'll take care of it.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.814
Scotty, keep things together
until I get back.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.608
I always do.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.885
Forty-five seconds to structural collapse.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.388
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.932
Kirk here.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.269
I don't know how much longer
I can hold her together.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.697
That's it. Let's go!

15:48.781 --> 15:50.949
Activate main deflector.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.958
We're breaking free.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.730
It's all right.
I'm increasing power to compensate.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.942
- We're clear.
- You did it, Kirk!

16:26.069 --> 16:27.819
Damage report, Ensign.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.447
There's some buckling
on the starboard nacelle.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.991
We've also got a hull breach
in Engineering section.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.452
Emergency force fields in place
and holding.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.995
Where?

16:37.747 --> 16:42.250
Sections 20 through 28 on Decks 13, 14

16:44.671 --> 16:46.254
and 15.

16:47.674 --> 16:53.261
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
Captain Kirk, please respond.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.936
Have Chekov meet me on Deck 15.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.717
My God! Was anyone in here?

17:34.971 --> 17:36.221
Aye.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.793
Bring out the prisoner.

18:59.764 --> 19:03.141
Mr. Worf,
I always knew this day would come.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.437
- Are you prepared to face the charges?
- Answer him.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.608
I am prepared.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.573
"We, the officers and crew
of the U.S.S. Enterprise,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.742
"being of sound mind and judgment,

19:21.160 --> 19:24.412
"hereby make the following charges
against Lieutenant Worf.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.750
"One, that he did knowingly and willfully

19:30.086 --> 19:33.505
"perform above and beyond
the call of duty on countless occasions.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.507
"Two, most seriously,

19:36.092 --> 19:40.512
"that he has earned the admiration
and respect of the entire crew."

19:40.930 --> 19:45.183
Mr. Worf, I hereby promote you
to the rank of Lieutenant Commander,

19:45.810 --> 19:48.687
with all the rights and privileges thereto.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.690
And may God have mercy on your soul.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.947
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

19:59.031 --> 20:00.240
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

20:00.324 --> 20:01.616
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

20:02.034 --> 20:04.494
- Congratulations, Mr. Worf.
- Thank you, sir.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.663
Extend the plank.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.214
Lower the badge of office.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.844
- Be careful.
- You go get that hat.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.805
He'll never make it. No one ever has.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.187
Jump!

20:47.371 --> 20:49.247
Yes! Yes, Worf!

20:49.749 --> 20:51.666
If there's one thing I've learned
over the years,

20:51.751 --> 20:54.002
it's never to underestimate a Klingon.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.717
Computer, remove the plank.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.596
Oh, no!

21:12.104 --> 21:16.524
Number One, that's "retract" plank,
not "remove" plank.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.109
Of course, sir.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.947
Sorry.

21:28.371 --> 21:32.874
Doctor, I must confess,
I am uncertain as to why

21:32.959 --> 21:36.419
someone falling into freezing water
is amusing.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.463
It's all in good fun, Data.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.215
- Fun?
- Fun.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.301
I do not understand.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.137
You've got to get into the spirit of things.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.307
Learn to be spontaneous,
live in the moment.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.644
- Do something unexpected. Get it?
- Got it.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.129
- Data.
- That was...

22:19.255 --> 22:20.755
Not funny.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.928
All hands, make sail.
T'gansuls and courses.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.597
- Stand by the braces.
- Will.

22:35.271 --> 22:39.482
Just imagine what it was like.
No engines, no computers,

22:39.608 --> 22:44.446
just the wind and the sea
and the stars to guide you.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.615
Bad food, brutal discipline.

22:48.826 --> 22:49.909
No women.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.537
- Bridge to Captain Picard.
- Picard here.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.124
There's a personal message for you
from Earth.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.293
Put it through down here.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.838
The best thing about life at sea, Will,
was that no one could reach you.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.383
This was freedom, Will.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.970
Computer, arch.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.060
Look alive there.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.825
Here, take the wheel.

23:51.889 --> 23:55.767
Captain, are you all right?

23:57.269 --> 24:01.397
Yes, I'm fine. Excuse me.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.443
Computer, exit.

24:12.284 --> 24:16.788
- Mr. La Forge, set royals and studsail.
- What's a studsail, sir?

24:17.540 --> 24:19.833
You see that last yardarm?
Just above that...

24:19.917 --> 24:22.627
- Bridge to Holodeck 3.
- Riker here.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.755
We're picking up a distress call
from the Amargosa Observatory, sir.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.049
They say they're under attack.

24:28.551 --> 24:32.262
Red alert! All hands to battle stations.
Captain Picard to the Bridge.

24:45.442 --> 24:49.404
- It looks like we're too late.
- There are no other ships in the system.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.574
Captain, we're approaching Amargosa.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.451
Looks like the observatory
took quite a beating.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.744
Survivors?

24:56.829 --> 24:59.455
Sensors show five life signs
aboard the station, Captain.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.833
The station's complement was 19.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.671
Stand down from red alert.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.176
Number One,

25:14.930 --> 25:17.682
will you begin an investigation?
I'll be in my Ready Room.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.602
- Sir? I thought you wanted...
- Make it so. Just do it!

25:22.479 --> 25:24.606
- Mr. Worf.
- Aye, sir.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.124
Mr. Worf, you're with me.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.711
These blast patterns are consistent
with a type-3 disruptor.

25:46.795 --> 25:51.216
Great. That narrows it down
to Romulan, Breen and Klingon.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.177
Over here!

26:39.515 --> 26:41.891
It's all right. Do not struggle.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.736
It's okay. We're right here. Got you.

27:01.787 --> 27:05.039
I'm Commander William Riker
from the Starship Enterprise.

27:06.792 --> 27:10.545
Soran. Dr. Tolian Soran.

27:11.463 --> 27:17.302
- Who attacked you, Doctor?
- I don't know. It all happened so fast.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.972
Commander,
you better take a look at this.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.077
Romulans.

27:45.289 --> 27:49.751
Data, whatever possessed you to push
her in the water in the first place?

27:50.169 --> 27:53.796
I was attempting
to get into the spirit of things.

27:54.631 --> 27:57.508
I thought it would be amusing. Spot.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.511
Is she still angry?

28:00.596 --> 28:04.349
I'd stay out of Sickbay
for a couple of days if I were you.

28:16.487 --> 28:20.573
Data, you're not actually thinking
about using that thing, are you?

28:20.657 --> 28:23.284
I have considered it for many months.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.871
And in light of my recent episode
with Dr. Crusher,

28:27.289 --> 28:29.582
now may be the appropriate time.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.835
I thought you were worried
about it overloading your neural net.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.213
That is true.

28:35.506 --> 28:40.176
However, I believe my growth
as an artificial life-form

28:40.302 --> 28:42.303
has reached an impasse.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.849
For 34 years, I have endeavored
to become more human,

28:47.476 --> 28:50.186
to grow beyond
my original programming.

28:51.480 --> 28:56.192
Still, I am unable to grasp
such a basic concept as humor.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.864
This emotion chip
may be the only answer.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.213
Geordi.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.717
All right.

29:36.191 --> 29:41.237
Listen, at the first sign of trouble,
I'm gonna deactivate it. Agreed?

29:42.698 --> 29:44.198
Agreed.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.123
We found two dead Romulans
on the station.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.584
We're analyzing their equipment
to see if we can determine

29:54.710 --> 29:56.294
what ship they came from.

29:57.546 --> 30:00.715
And there's still no indication
of why they attacked the station?

30:01.091 --> 30:05.386
They practically tore the place apart.
Accessed the central computer,

30:05.721 --> 30:07.096
turned the cargo bay inside out.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.807
Obviously,
they were looking for something.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.895
This could signify
a new Romulan threat in this sector.

30:17.232 --> 30:21.736
- Inform Starfleet Command.
- You want me to contact Starfleet?

30:22.237 --> 30:23.905
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.743
There was something else, Captain.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.747
One of the scientists, a Dr. Soran,
insisted on speaking with you.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.582
I told him you were very busy.

30:34.666 --> 30:38.085
He said it was absolutely imperative
that he speak with you right away.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.129
Understood. That will be all.

30:48.472 --> 30:52.099
- Sir, is there anything more...
- No, thank you.

31:09.826 --> 31:13.788
Gentlemen,
something new from Forcas III?

31:21.338 --> 31:22.463
What?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.467
I believe this beverage has produced
an emotional response.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.553
Really? What are you feeling?

31:31.139 --> 31:32.682
I am uncertain.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.809
Because I have had little experience
with emotion,

31:34.893 --> 31:37.979
I am unable to articulate the sensation.

31:39.314 --> 31:43.067
- Emotion?
- I'll explain later.

31:46.196 --> 31:51.659
- Well, it looks like he hates it.
- Yes, that is it.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.831
- I hate this.
- Data, I think the chip is working.

32:01.211 --> 32:04.964
Yes, I hate this. It is revolting.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.008
- More?
- Please.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.894
I'm looking for a Dr. Soran
from the observatory.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.780
- Dr. Soran?
- Yes.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.366
Yes, Captain, thank you for coming.
Thank you.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.161
I understand there's something urgent
you wish to discuss with me.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.623
Yes. I must return
to the observatory immediately.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.752
I must continue a critical experiment
I've been running on the Amargosa star.

32:42.878 --> 32:45.212
We're still conducting our investigation
into the attack.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.922
- Yes, I...
- As soon as that is complete,

32:47.049 --> 32:48.674
then I will allow you
and your colleagues to return.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.426
But until then, there's nothing I can do.

32:50.552 --> 32:54.305
Timing is very important
in my experiments.

32:55.140 --> 33:00.144
If it's not completed in the next 12 hours,
years of research will be lost.

33:00.228 --> 33:03.439
We're doing the best we can.
If you'll excuse me.

33:05.567 --> 33:10.154
They say time is the fire
in which we burn.

33:13.659 --> 33:17.244
Right now, Captain,
my time is running out.

33:19.623 --> 33:23.417
We leave so many things
unfinished in our lives.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.254
I know you understand.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.593
I'll see what I can do.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.179
We have analyzed
the Romulans' tricorder.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.181
They were scanning
for signature particles

34:20.308 --> 34:23.561
- of a compound called trilithium.
- Trilithium?

34:23.645 --> 34:26.731
Yes, an experimental compound
the Romulans have been working on.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.024
Trilithium is a nuclear inhibitor.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.402
In theory,
it could stop all fusion within a star.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.697
However, the Romulans never found
a way to stabilize it.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.574
Why would they look for it
on a Federation observatory?

34:37.659 --> 34:39.201
That doesn't make any sense.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.579
I do not know.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.914
Have Geordi and Data go over
with the next away team.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.623
Tell them to scan the observatory
for trilithium.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.251
Aye, sir.

34:51.547 --> 34:56.177
Well, there's no sign
of any trilithium over here.

35:03.727 --> 35:08.439
- I get it! I get it!
- You get what?

35:09.191 --> 35:13.819
When you said to Commander Riker,
"The clown can stay,

35:13.904 --> 35:17.072
"but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit
has to go."

35:18.200 --> 35:19.617
What are you talking about?

35:19.701 --> 35:21.744
During the Farpoint mission.

35:21.870 --> 35:26.290
We were on the Bridge. You told a joke.
That was the punch line.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.377
Farpoint...
Data, that was seven years ago.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.047
I know. I just got it!

35:34.549 --> 35:35.925
Very funny.

35:55.153 --> 35:59.323
Wait a minute.
There's a door hidden right behind you.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.909
I can see the separation with my visor.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.662
There appears to be a dampening field
in operation.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.331
I cannot scan beyond the bulkhead.

36:07.833 --> 36:11.794
There doesn't seem to be
a control panel or an access port.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.089
It appears to be magnetically sealed.

36:16.091 --> 36:20.511
I believe I can reverse the polarity
by attenuating my axial servo.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.270
Open sesame.

36:35.819 --> 36:39.822
You could say
I have a magnetic personality.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.326
Humor, I love it!

37:04.556 --> 37:07.850
Data, come take a look at this, will you?

37:11.396 --> 37:14.982
Have you ever seen a solar probe
with this kind of configuration?

37:15.150 --> 37:19.028
No, Geordi, I have not. Have you?

37:19.404 --> 37:22.406
No, I have not. It is most unusual.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.910
Mr. Tricorder.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.497
Just see if you can help me
get these panels open, will you?

37:30.832 --> 37:32.416
Make it so.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.052
My visor's picking up something
in the theta band.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.429
It could be a trilithium signature.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.518
- Data, we don't have time for this.
- I cannot help myself.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.688
I think something is wrong.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.947
Data?

38:10.956 --> 38:14.249
Data. Data, are you all right?

38:19.089 --> 38:23.384
I believe the emotion chip
has overloaded my positronic relay.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.720
We'd better get you back to the ship.
La Forge to Enterprise.

38:30.558 --> 38:34.144
- La Forge to Enterprise.
- Gentlemen, is there a problem?

38:34.896 --> 38:36.397
Dr. Soran.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.984
Yeah. There seems to be
some sort of dampening field in here.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.987
It's blocking our comm signal.
Can you shut it off for us?

38:43.154 --> 38:46.281
Of course, I'd be only too happy to.

38:57.293 --> 39:00.004
Please. Please. No.

39:01.256 --> 39:05.759
Do not... Do not hurt me.
Please, please.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.866
Yes, come.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.954
Yes, Counselor?
Is there something I can do for you?

39:34.998 --> 39:37.958
Actually I'm here to see
if there's anything I can do for you.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.377
It's just family matters.

39:43.465 --> 39:46.633
You never met my brother and his wife,
did you?

39:47.469 --> 39:49.720
- No.
- Robert.

39:53.391 --> 39:57.478
So opinionated.
So pompous and arrogant.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.397
He always had to have the last word.

40:01.483 --> 40:05.319
But he mellowed a little bit
in the last few years.

40:08.073 --> 40:11.241
I was going to get together with them all
next month on Earth.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.660
I thought we'd go to San Francisco.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.538
René's always wanted
to see Starfleet Academy.

40:16.706 --> 40:19.416
René? Your nephew.

40:19.501 --> 40:23.253
Yes. He's so unlike his father.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.675
He's a dreamer, imaginative.

40:31.262 --> 40:35.015
He's so very gentle.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.774
What's happened?

40:46.027 --> 40:48.028
Robert and René, they're...

40:50.698 --> 40:53.534
Burned to death in a fire.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.789
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.166
These things happen.

41:01.251 --> 41:05.379
Captain, it's not all right.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.757
I can't help thinking about

41:10.552 --> 41:14.054
all the experiences
that René's not gonna have,

41:14.305 --> 41:18.976
about going to the Academy,
reading books and listening to music

41:19.727 --> 41:21.728
and falling in love,

41:24.399 --> 41:25.983
building a life.

41:29.154 --> 41:33.740
Well, that's not going to happen now.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.581
I didn't realize he meant so much to you.

41:41.916 --> 41:45.043
I'd come to feel that René was as close
as I would get

41:45.128 --> 41:47.254
to having a child of my own.

42:00.685 --> 42:03.645
Your family history is very important
to you, isn't it?

42:03.771 --> 42:04.855
What?

42:10.028 --> 42:13.030
From being a small child,

42:13.323 --> 42:16.450
I can remember being told
about the family line.

42:16.659 --> 42:19.119
The Picard who fought at Trafalgar.

42:19.495 --> 42:22.539
The Picard who won
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

42:23.041 --> 42:26.376
The Picards who settled
the first Martian colonies.

42:29.297 --> 42:34.509
And when Robert married
and he had a son, I...

42:37.013 --> 42:39.348
You felt it was no longer
your responsibility

42:39.474 --> 42:41.558
to carry on the family line.

42:43.061 --> 42:46.688
Right. Yes. That's it exactly.

42:50.360 --> 42:54.988
You know, Counselor,
recently I've become very much aware

42:55.073 --> 42:58.659
that there were fewer days ahead
than there are behind,

42:58.743 --> 43:04.831
but I took some comfort from the fact
that the family would go on.

43:09.671 --> 43:12.172
But now there'll be no more Picards.

43:26.688 --> 43:27.771
Report.

43:27.855 --> 43:30.524
A quantum implosion has occurred
within the Amargosa star.

43:30.608 --> 43:35.904
- All nuclear fusion is breaking down.
- How is that possible?

43:36.030 --> 43:37.823
Sensor records show
the observatory launched

43:37.907 --> 43:40.575
a solar probe into the sun
a few moments ago.

43:40.702 --> 43:42.953
The star is going to collapse
in a matter of minutes.

43:43.037 --> 43:46.957
Sir, the implosion has produced
a level-12 shock wave.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.084
That'll destroy everything in this system.

43:49.210 --> 43:50.544
Transporter Room to Bridge.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.547
I can't locate Commander La Forge
or Mr. Data, sir.

43:53.631 --> 43:57.634
- Have they come back to the ship?
- No, sir. They are not on board.

43:58.928 --> 44:00.804
How long before the shock wave
hits the observatory?

44:00.888 --> 44:02.639
Four minutes, 40 seconds.

44:02.807 --> 44:03.974
Number One.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.059
- Mr. Worf!
- Aye, sir.

44:18.740 --> 44:21.158
Soran, transmit your coordinates.

44:36.424 --> 44:38.300
What the hell's he doing?

44:39.427 --> 44:42.387
Enterprise to Commander Riker.
You have two minutes left.

44:42.472 --> 44:44.264
You hear that, Soran?

44:44.766 --> 44:48.518
We've got a level-12 shock wave
coming in. We gotta get out of here!

44:51.689 --> 44:55.650
Sir, a Klingon bird-of-prey
is decloaking off the port bow.

44:57.278 --> 44:58.612
What?

45:12.377 --> 45:18.548
- Data, see if you can get to Geordi.
- I cannot, sir.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.386
Prepare for transport.

45:37.527 --> 45:42.072
- Commander Riker's team is aboard, sir.
- Helm, warp 1, engage!

45:55.920 --> 45:57.838
You've done it, Soran.

46:05.346 --> 46:06.555
Wait!

46:21.946 --> 46:26.950
I hope for your sake
you were initiating a mating ritual.

46:27.577 --> 46:29.369
You got careless.

46:29.454 --> 46:32.706
The Romulans came looking
for their missing trilithium.

46:32.790 --> 46:38.086
Impossible.
We left no survivors on their outpost.

46:38.212 --> 46:42.799
They knew it was on the observatory.
If the Enterprise hadn't intervened,

46:42.884 --> 46:44.551
they would have found it.

46:44.635 --> 46:49.639
They didn't find it! And now
we have a weapon of unlimited power.

46:50.141 --> 46:55.979
No, Lursa, I have the weapon,
and if you ever want me to give it to you,

46:56.063 --> 47:00.233
I would advise you to be
a little more careful in the future.

47:00.902 --> 47:03.445
Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

47:05.156 --> 47:09.117
Without my research,
the trilithium is worthless,

47:10.995 --> 47:14.789
as are your plans
to re-conquer the Klingon Empire.

47:21.172 --> 47:25.926
Set course for the Veridian system.
Maximum warp.

47:32.016 --> 47:35.435
He's an El-Aurian, over 300 years old.

47:35.937 --> 47:39.272
He lost his entire family
when the Borg destroyed his planet.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.816
Soran escaped
with a handful of other refugees

47:42.276 --> 47:44.444
aboard a ship called the Lakul.

47:44.529 --> 47:48.281
That ship was later destroyed
by some kind of energy ribbon.

47:48.366 --> 47:52.619
But Soran and 46 others
were rescued by the Enterprise-B.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.746
That was the mission
where James Kirk was killed.

47:54.830 --> 47:57.374
I checked the passenger manifest
of the Lakul.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.126
Guess who else was on board.

48:04.048 --> 48:06.925
Soran is a name I haven't heard
for a long time.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.553
- You remember him?
- Yes.

48:11.681 --> 48:16.393
Guinan, it is very important that
you tell me everything that you know.

48:16.978 --> 48:22.399
We think that Soran has developed
a weapon, a terrible weapon,

48:23.025 --> 48:25.694
one that might even give him
enough power to destroy an entire...

48:25.820 --> 48:28.822
Soran doesn't care about weapons
or power.

48:29.657 --> 48:32.617
He just cares about getting
back to the Nexus.

48:32.702 --> 48:34.327
What is the Nexus?

48:36.247 --> 48:38.707
The energy ribbon
that destroyed that ship

48:39.250 --> 48:43.044
was not just some random phenomena
traveling through the universe.

48:43.170 --> 48:47.507
It's a doorway to another place
that we call the Nexus,

48:47.592 --> 48:51.177
and it's a place I've tried very,
very hard to forget.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.437
What happened to you?

49:05.026 --> 49:08.028
It was like being inside joy.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.323
As if joy was something tangible

49:11.407 --> 49:14.701
and you could wrap yourself up in it
like a blanket,

49:16.120 --> 49:20.790
and never in my entire life
have I ever been as content.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.294
And then you were beamed
away from there.

49:24.378 --> 49:27.631
Pulled. Ripped away.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.550
None of us wanted to go,

49:31.385 --> 49:35.263
and I would have done anything,
anything to get back there.

49:39.268 --> 49:41.186
And once I realized that wasn't
possible,

49:41.270 --> 49:43.063
I learned to live with that.

49:43.147 --> 49:44.397
What about Soran?

49:44.482 --> 49:48.151
If he's still obsessed,
he could be a very, very dangerous man.

49:50.655 --> 49:52.947
Why would he destroy a star?

49:58.621 --> 50:00.497
Thank you, Guinan.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.919
If you go,

50:07.338 --> 50:10.423
you're not gonna care about anything.

50:11.759 --> 50:15.261
Not this ship, not Soran, not me.
Nothing.

50:16.263 --> 50:19.599
All you'll want is to stay in the Nexus,

50:21.352 --> 50:24.020
and you're not gonna want
to come back.

50:40.121 --> 50:41.830
Marvelous technology.

50:42.790 --> 50:46.126
This is a remarkable
piece of equipment.

50:46.293 --> 50:51.965
- Glad you approve.
- It's not very stylish, though, is it?

50:55.136 --> 51:00.306
Have you ever considered a prosthesis
that would make you look a little more...

51:00.975 --> 51:04.144
How can I say? More normal?

51:04.478 --> 51:07.480
- What's normal?
- What's normal?

51:07.815 --> 51:10.150
Well, that's a good question.

51:10.985 --> 51:14.821
Normal is what everyone else is
and you are not.

51:18.159 --> 51:22.203
Can we just get down to it, please?
What do you want?

51:22.705 --> 51:27.751
As you may or may not be aware,
I am an El-Aurian.

51:27.877 --> 51:31.838
Some people call us a race of listeners.
We listen.

51:33.591 --> 51:38.261
Right now, Mr. La Forge,
you have my complete attention.

51:38.721 --> 51:43.183
I want to listen to everything
you know about trilithium.

51:47.605 --> 51:52.650
Captain's Log, Stardate 48632.4.
Dr. Crusher has informed me

51:52.735 --> 51:55.820
that Data's emotion chip has been fused
into his neural net

51:55.905 --> 51:57.447
and cannot be removed.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.365
However, she believes he is fit for duty,

51:59.450 --> 52:02.786
so I've asked him to join me
in Stellar Cartography.

52:03.704 --> 52:08.041
According to our information, the ribbon
is a conflux of temporal energy

52:08.125 --> 52:11.878
which travels through this galaxy
every 39.1 years.

52:12.546 --> 52:16.216
It will pass through this sector
in approximately 42 hours.

52:16.383 --> 52:18.301
Yes. Guinan was right.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.720
She said that Soran was trying
to get back to the ribbon.

52:20.805 --> 52:22.472
Now, if that's true,

52:22.556 --> 52:25.725
there has to be some connection
with the Amargosa star.

52:25.810 --> 52:29.395
Data, give me a list of anything that
was affected by the star's destruction,

52:29.480 --> 52:31.105
no matter how insignificant.

52:32.441 --> 52:35.068
- Data?
- Sorry, sir.

52:38.739 --> 52:42.408
It will take the computer a few moments
to compile the information.

52:45.996 --> 52:49.749
Data, are you all right?

52:51.794 --> 52:57.340
No, sir.
I am finding it difficult to concentrate.

52:58.759 --> 53:04.097
I believe I am overwhelmed
with feelings of remorse

53:04.431 --> 53:08.351
and regret concerning my actions
on the observatory.

53:08.602 --> 53:09.936
What do you mean?

53:10.646 --> 53:13.273
I wanted to save Geordi,

53:14.775 --> 53:17.986
but I experienced
something I did not expect.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.198
Fear.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.118
I was afraid.

53:29.290 --> 53:32.750
According to our current information,
the destruction of the Amargosa star

53:32.835 --> 53:35.587
has had the following effects
in this sector.

53:35.671 --> 53:39.799
Gamma emissions
have increased by.05%.

53:40.009 --> 53:43.803
The Starship Bozeman was forced
to make a course correction.

53:43.971 --> 53:45.263
Ambient magnetic fields...

53:45.347 --> 53:49.309
Wait. The Bozeman,
why would it make a course correction?

53:49.476 --> 53:51.102
The destruction of the Amargosa star

53:51.186 --> 53:54.439
has altered the gravitational forces
throughout this sector.

53:54.523 --> 53:56.733
As a result,
any ship passing through this region

53:56.817 --> 53:59.360
would have to make
a minor course correction.

53:59.486 --> 54:03.489
A minor course correction.
Where's the ribbon now?

54:13.500 --> 54:17.337
- This is its current position.
- Can you project its course?

54:22.551 --> 54:24.010
Captain.

54:28.182 --> 54:32.644
I cannot continue with this investigation.
I wish to be deactivated

54:32.728 --> 54:35.647
until Dr. Crusher can remove
the emotion chip.

54:35.731 --> 54:37.649
Are you having some kind
of malfunction?

54:37.733 --> 54:42.445
No, sir. I simply do not have the ability
to control these emotions.

54:43.364 --> 54:46.532
Data, I have nothing but sympathy
for what you are feeling,

54:47.034 --> 54:48.785
but right now, I need you to...

54:48.869 --> 54:51.704
Sir, I no longer want these emotions!

54:52.039 --> 54:55.375
Deactivating me
is the only viable solution.

54:55.459 --> 55:00.380
Part of having feelings is learning
to integrate them into your life, Data,

55:00.589 --> 55:01.881
learning to live with them

55:02.049 --> 55:03.716
- no matter what the circumstances.
- Sir, I cannot!

55:03.801 --> 55:05.760
You will not be deactivated.

55:06.387 --> 55:07.804
You're an officer on board this ship,

55:07.888 --> 55:11.975
and I require you to perform your duty.
That is an order, Commander.

55:12.059 --> 55:13.309
Yes, sir.

55:17.231 --> 55:18.898
I will try, sir.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.406
Sometimes it takes courage to try, Data,

55:27.408 --> 55:29.909
and courage can be an emotion, too.

55:30.953 --> 55:33.913
Now, can you project the course
of the ribbon?

55:34.665 --> 55:36.249
I believe so.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.922
Enhance grid 9-A.

55:46.260 --> 55:48.678
Where was the Amargosa star?

55:52.307 --> 55:54.726
Now, you said that when
the Amargosa star was destroyed,

55:54.810 --> 55:57.061
it affected the gravitational forces
in this sector.

55:57.146 --> 55:59.313
Now, did the computer
take that into account

55:59.481 --> 56:01.274
when it projected
the course of the ribbon?

56:01.358 --> 56:04.318
No, sir.
I will make the appropriate adjustments.

56:07.781 --> 56:11.451
That's what Soran's doing.
He's changing the course of the ribbon.

56:12.286 --> 56:17.290
But why?
Why would he try to change its path?

56:17.958 --> 56:20.460
Why doesn't he just fly into it
with a ship?

56:20.627 --> 56:23.087
Our records show that every ship
which has approached the ribbon

56:23.172 --> 56:26.507
has either been destroyed
or severely damaged.

56:29.136 --> 56:33.139
He can't get to the ribbon, so he's trying
to make the ribbon come to him.

56:33.348 --> 56:37.685
Data, does it pass near
to any M-Class planets?

56:38.228 --> 56:41.647
Yes, sir.
There are two in the Veridian system.

56:42.399 --> 56:46.527
Well, it gets close to Veridian III,
but not close enough.

56:47.029 --> 56:51.657
Data, what would happen
to the ribbon's course

56:51.825 --> 56:54.911
if Soran destroyed
the Veridian star itself?

56:59.833 --> 57:01.501
That's where he's going.

57:02.669 --> 57:04.504
It should be noted, sir,

57:04.880 --> 57:07.840
that the collapse of the Veridian star
would produce a shock wave

57:08.008 --> 57:10.676
similar to the one we observed
at Amargosa.

57:10.928 --> 57:13.596
Destroying all the planets in this system.

57:16.225 --> 57:18.518
Veridian III is uninhabited.

57:19.686 --> 57:23.856
However, Veridian IV supports
a pre-industrial humanoid society.

57:24.066 --> 57:25.608
Population?

57:27.903 --> 57:30.571
Two hundred thirty million, sir.

57:33.367 --> 57:35.118
- Picard to Bridge.
- Worf here, sir.

57:35.202 --> 57:38.204
Set a course for the Veridian system,
maximum warp.

58:04.231 --> 58:07.233
Did you get anything from the human?

58:07.317 --> 58:10.653
No. His heart just wasn't in it.

58:12.239 --> 58:15.241
We have entered orbit of Veridian III.

58:17.578 --> 58:24.083
- Prepare to transport me to the surface.
- Wait. When do we get our payment?

58:32.426 --> 58:37.096
This contains all the information
you'll need to make a trilithium weapon.

58:39.099 --> 58:40.933
It's been coded.

58:41.185 --> 58:43.728
Once I'm safely to the surface,

58:43.812 --> 58:46.898
I'll transmit
the decryption sequence to you.

58:46.982 --> 58:49.525
- Not before.
- Mistress!

58:49.610 --> 58:51.694
A Federation starship
is entering the system.

58:51.778 --> 58:54.113
What? On viewer.

58:55.657 --> 58:56.824
They're hailing us.

58:57.993 --> 59:00.161
We're still cloaked. They can't see us.

59:00.621 --> 59:03.581
Klingon vessel,
we know what you are doing,

59:03.665 --> 59:07.460
and we will destroy any probe
launched toward the Veridian star.

59:07.878 --> 59:09.712
We demand that you return
our chief engineer

59:09.796 --> 59:11.964
and leave this system immediately.

59:12.132 --> 59:15.635
There's no time for this. Eliminate them.

59:15.886 --> 59:20.056
That is a Galaxy-class starship.
We're no match for them.

59:22.684 --> 59:26.312
I think it's time we gave Mr. La Forge
his sight back.

59:36.406 --> 59:37.782
Maybe they're not out there.

59:37.866 --> 59:41.202
They're just trying to decide
if a 20-year-old Klingon bird-of-prey

59:41.328 --> 59:43.704
can be a match
for the Federation flagship.

59:43.830 --> 59:48.584
- Perhaps they're on the surface.
- Sir, according to my calculations,

59:48.669 --> 59:51.879
a solar probe launched from either
the Klingon ship or the planet surface

59:52.005 --> 59:53.714
will take 11 seconds to reach the sun.

59:53.840 --> 59:56.926
However, since we do not have
an exact point of origin,

59:58.011 --> 01:00:01.514
it will take us between 8 and 15 seconds
to lock our weapons onto it.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:04.183
- That's a pretty big margin of error.
- Much too big.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.394
Mr. Data,
how long before the ribbon arrives?

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.521
Approximately 47 minutes, sir.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:12.483
We have got to find some way
to get to Soran.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:15.695
Klingon vessel decloaking
directly ahead, sir.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.118
- They are hailing.
- On screen.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.163
Captain. What an unexpected pleasure.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:29.542
Lursa, it is very important
that I speak with Soran.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.878
I'm afraid the doctor
is no longer aboard our ship.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:38.551
- Then I will beam to his location.
- The doctor values his privacy.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:43.139
He would be quite upset
if an armed away team interrupted him.

01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:46.142
Then I will beam to your ship
and you can transport me to Soran.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.144
We can't trust them.
For all we know, they killed Geordi.

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:49.520
They might kill you, too.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:54.817
We did not harm your engineer.
He's been our guest.

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:55.985
Then return him!

01:00:56.069 --> 01:01:00.281
- In exchange for what?
- Me, sir.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.618
Me. I will be your prisoner.

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:06.370
But first,
you must beam me to the surface

01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:08.247
so that I can speak with Soran.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:13.669
The Captain would make
a much more valuable hostage.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:19.675
- We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
- Agreed.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.264
Have Dr. Crusher meet me
in Transporter Room 3.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.016
You have the Bridge, Number One.

01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:35.316
- Receiving the coordinates, Captain.
- Energize.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.646
Welcome, Captain.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:28.369
- You must think I'm quite the madman.
- The thought had crossed my mind.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:30.663
I know why you're here.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.084
You're not entirely confident
you can shoot down my probe,

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:41.340
so you've come to dissuade me
from my horrific plan. Good luck.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:46.554
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,
I'm rather busy.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.181
Soran.

01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:00.359
Do be careful, Captain.
That's a 50-gigawatt force field.

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:02.278
I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.030
I have established the link.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.076
Put it on viewer.

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:13.873
It's working. The visor's transmitting.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.250
Where is he?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:29.221
Human females are so repulsive.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:33.058
...and some myocardial degeneration.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:36.729
I've removed the nanoprobe,
and I think you're going to be fine.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.148
I'll need to run some more tests.
I'll let you know.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.733
Thanks, Doc.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:47.114
- Geordi...
- Data, it's okay.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.284
I am sorry I let you down.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:53.913
I have not been behaving
like myself lately.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:58.667
No, Data, you haven't.
You've been behaving like a human.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.356
You don't have to do this, Soran.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:24.610
I'm sure we can find another way
of getting you into this Nexus.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:28.697
I've spent 80 years
looking for another way.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.618
Believe me, this is the only one.

01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:41.627
What you're about to do, Soran,
is no different

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:44.547
from when the Borg destroyed
your world.

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:47.049
They killed millions, too,

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:51.387
including your wife, children.

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:00.312
Nice try.

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:09.572
You know, there was a time
when I wouldn't hurt a fly.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.074
Then the Borg came,

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:18.747
and they showed me that if there
is one constant in this whole universe,

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.541
it's death.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.628
Afterwards, I began to realize
it didn't really matter.

01:05:24.713 --> 01:05:28.841
We're all gonna die sometime.
It's just a question of how and when.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.176
You will, too, Captain.

01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:35.681
Aren't you beginning to feel
time gaining on you?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:42.730
It's like a predator. It's stalking you.

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:50.529
You can try and outrun it with doctors,
medicines, new technologies,

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:55.868
but in the end, time is going
to hunt you down and make the kill.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:06:01.373
It's our mortality that defines us, Soran.
It's part of the truth of our existence.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:09.965
- What if I told you I found a new truth?
- The Nexus?

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:15.971
Time has no meaning there.
The predator has no teeth.

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:20.809
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:24.063
He bathed. Now he's roaming the ship.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.399
He must be the only engineer
in Starfleet

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.735
who doesn't go to Engineering.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:34.490
- Any luck, Mr. Worf?
- No, sir. I still cannot locate the Captain.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.620
Data, the sensors can't penetrate
the planet's ionosphere.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:40.829
There's too much interference.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.790
Can you find a way
to scan for life-forms?

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.667
I would be happy to, sir.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:49.338
I just love scanning for life-forms.

01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:53.425
Life-forms

01:06:54.094 --> 01:06:57.012
You tiny little life-forms

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.183
You precious little life-forms

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:03.977
Where are you?

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.028
Finally.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:18.158
Commander, I'd like to run a level 3
diagnostic on the port plasma relays.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:19.910
I think one of the generators
is fluctuating.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.453
Fine. Let's do that.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:37.219
That's it! Replay from time index 924.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.853
Magnify this section and enhance.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:55.028
Their shields are operating
on a modulation of 257.4.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:58.240
Adjust our torpedo frequency to match.
257.4.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.337
They have found a way
to penetrate our shields.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.047
Lock phasers and return fire!

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.558
Deanna, take the helm.
Get us out of orbit!

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:27.435
Hull breach on Decks 31 through 35.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.361
Mr. Worf, what do we know about
that old Klingon ship?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.782
- Any weaknesses?
- It's a Class-D12 bird-of-prey.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.658
They were retired from service
because of defective plasma coils.

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:45.162
Plasma coils? Is there any way
we can use that to our advantage?

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:49.374
I do not see how. The plasma coil
is part of their cloaking device.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:57.758
Let's get a stabilizer on that conduit.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:01.720
Reinforce that starboard interlock.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:04.096
We need to re-route main power
through the secondary coupling.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:09.895
Data, would a defective plasma coil be
susceptible to some sort of ionic pulse?

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.816
Perhaps. Yes, yes.
If we sent a low-level ionic pulse,

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:16.151
it might reset the coil
and trigger their cloaking device.

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:18.319
Excellent idea, sir!

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.281
As their cloak begins to engage,
their shields will drop.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.783
They'll have two seconds
of vulnerability. Mr. Data,

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.411
- lock on to plasma coil.
- No problem.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:33.752
- Our shields are holding.
- Fire at will.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.756
Mr. Worf,
prepare a spread of photon torpedoes.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.591
We have to hit them
the instant they begin to cloak.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.844
- Aye, sir.
- We get one shot at this.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.595
Target their primary reactor.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:52.604
I have accessed their core frequency.
Initiating ionic pulse.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.273
Make it quick!

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:05.576
- Target their bridge.
- Full disruptors.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.077
- We are cloaking.
- What?

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:08.787
Our shields are down!

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.459
Fire.

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.243
Yes!

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:34.790
Haven't you got anything better to do?

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.544
Must have been that last torpedo.
La Forge to Bridge.

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:21.962
I've got a problem down here.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.589
The magnetic interlocks
have been ruptured. I...

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:30.178
Coolant leak!
We have a coolant leak, everybody.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:31.346
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:35.267
Everybody out. Let's move!
Let's move! We've gotta go!

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:36.768
- Quick!
- Evacuate! Evacuate!

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:38.353
Bridge, we have a new problem.

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:40.188
We're five minutes
from a warp core breach.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.690
There's nothing I can do.

01:12:44.152 --> 01:12:46.778
Deanna, evacuate everyone
to the saucer section.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.531
Mr. Data, prepare to separate the ship.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.329
Starship separation in five minutes.

01:12:56.456 --> 01:13:00.292
- We're going straight down.
- Everyone move. Take Corridor A.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:09.634
Starship separation
in four minutes, 45 seconds.

01:13:14.182 --> 01:13:17.142
All right, let's move him out. Let's go.
Take him out, quick.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.815
Starship separation
in four minutes, 30 seconds.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.402
- Keep moving, everyone. Keep going.
- Here we go, Rose, this way.

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:33.658
Starship separation
in four minutes, 15 seconds.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.035
- Hurry!
- Keep moving.

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:38.163
- Farrell!
- Yes?

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:41.917
There's no one here with these kids.
Let's get them to the Jefferies tube.

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:44.252
- Come on, sweetie.
- We'll find their parents later.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:48.006
Starship separation in four minutes.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:20.622
Now you'll have to excuse me, Captain.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:25.877
I have an appointment with eternity,
and I don't want to be late.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:46.106
The core breach is accelerating, Geordi.
We've gotta get out of here.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:50.986
- That's it, Bridge. We're all out.
- One minute to warp core breach.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:54.322
Begin separation sequence.
Full impulse power once we're clear.

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:55.782
Warp core is going critical.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:13.967
- Separation complete.
- Engaging impulse engines.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.428
Core breach in progress.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:27.522
Primary stabilizers off-line.
Engaging secondary systems.

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:35.614
- Report!
- Helm controls are off-line!

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.331
Oh, shit!

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:34.339
Here we go. Right around this corner!

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:38.176
Come and help me. Help me.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:40.887
Just keep moving.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:43.348
- On the ground.
- Everybody on the bed!

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:52.774
I have re-routed auxiliary power
to the lateral thrusters.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:55.026
Attempting to level our descent.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.279
All hands, brace for impact!

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:04.869
- Hold on, everybody. Hold on tight.
- Hold their heads.

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:57.065
I'm okay.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:32.697
What... What is this? Where am I?

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:52.884
- Surprise!
- We love you, Father.

01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:55.386
- Were you scared?
- Look at the tree.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.473
- I helped decorate it.
- It took all day.

01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:01.017
- Say, "Merry Christmas," Papa.
- See the presents?

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:03.478
- I love you, Father.
- I love you, too.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:07.899
Come on, children. Let's move back
and give your father some room.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:24.415
- Cup of Earl Grey?
- That would be perfect.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.136
- This one's for you.
- Thank you very much, René.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.848
- Merry Christmas, Uncle.
- And Merry Christmas to you, too.

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:43.351
René, can you help me with the table?

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:46.604
René!

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.191
Come here.

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:08.793
Go help your aunt.

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:25.560
Did you get anything else?

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:52.230
This isn't right.

01:25:53.774 --> 01:25:57.819
- This can't be real.
- It's as real as you want it to be.

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:02.824
Guinan, what's going on?

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:07.578
- Why am I here?
- You're in the Nexus.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:14.418
- This is the Nexus?
- For you. This is what you wanted.

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:20.633
But I never had a home like this.

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:28.432
Nor a wife and children,
but these are all mine.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:34.689
Guinan, what are you doing here?

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.400
I thought you were on board
the Enterprise.

01:26:37.484 --> 01:26:40.278
I am. I'm also here.

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:45.449
Think of me as an echo
of the person you know,

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:48.661
a part of herself she left behind.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.789
When the Enterprise-B
beamed you up from the Lakul.

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:57.003
- Papa, help me build my castle.
- Yes, I will in a few minutes.

01:26:58.839 --> 01:27:04.719
Papa, thank you for the dolly.
She's very beautiful.

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:13.561
These are my children.
These are my children.

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:17.231
Of course. Time has no meaning here,

01:27:18.025 --> 01:27:20.151
so you can go back and see them born

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:23.863
or go forward
and see your grandchildren.

01:27:25.532 --> 01:27:27.033
Dinner's ready, everyone.

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:28.367
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:31.370
Mama, can I...

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:35.333
- Dinner's ready, Papa.
- Yes, of course. Come on, Thomas.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.043
It's your favorite.

01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:08.407
Go on. Go on without me.

01:28:29.388 --> 01:28:33.099
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:36.727
- Where would you go?
- I don't understand.

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:39.605
Well, as I said,
time has no meaning here.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:43.567
So, if you leave,
you can go anywhere, any time.

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:46.112
All right,
I know exactly where I want to go.

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:50.116
To the mountaintop on Veridian III
just before Soran destroyed the star.

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:53.911
I have to stop him, but I need help.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:55.997
Now, if you were
to come back with me, together...

01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:59.834
I can't leave.
I'm there already, remember?

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:03.587
But I bet I know someone who can.

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:08.259
And from his point of view,
he just got here, too.

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:18.644
Kirk.

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:22.690
James T. Kirk.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:29.488
Beautiful day.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:34.785
Yes, it certainly is.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.170
Would you mind?

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:59.143
Captain, I'm wondering, do you realize...

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:02.354
Hold on a minute.
Do you smell something burning?

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:18.412
Looks like somebody was trying
to cook some eggs. Come on in.

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.875
It's all right. It's my house.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.339
At least it used to be.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.842
I sold it years ago.

01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:39.183
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.063
The clock.

01:30:48.527 --> 01:30:50.528
I gave this clock to Bones.

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:56.283
I'm from what you would consider
the future, the 24th century.

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:01.747
Butler!

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:07.753
Butler.

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.549
How can you be here?

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.094
He's been dead seven years.

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:17.888
Come on, Jim. I'm starving.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:21.559
How long are you gonna
be rattling around in that kitchen?

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:23.227
Antonia.

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:30.985
What are you talking about? The future?

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:34.405
This is the past.

01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:38.576
This is nine years ago.

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:58.262
The day I told her
I was going back to Starfleet.

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:12.359
And these are Ktarian eggs,
her favorite.

01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:14.987
I was preparing them to soften the blow.

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:20.826
I know how real this must seem to you,
but it's not.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:23.996
This isn't really your house.

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:27.791
We are both of us caught up
in some kind of temporal nexus.

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.463
- Dill.
- I beg your pardon?

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:35.633
Dill weed.
In the cabinet, second shelf to the left.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.303
Behind the oregano.

01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:50.022
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:56.111
I was aboard the Enterprise-B
in the Deflector Control Room and...

01:32:56.196 --> 01:32:57.988
Stir these, will you?

01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:59.990
The bulkhead
in front of me disappeared,

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:02.868
and then I found myself out there,
just now, chopping wood

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:05.162
right before you walked up.

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:07.498
Thanks.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:12.378
Look, history records

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:18.217
that you died saving the Enterprise-B
from an energy ribbon 80 years ago.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.596
You say this is the 24th century?

01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:27.559
- And I'm dead?
- Not exactly. As I said,

01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:31.188
- this is some kind of temporal nexus.
- Temporal nexus, yes, I heard you.

01:33:31.898 --> 01:33:35.067
- I...
- Something is missing.

01:33:40.907 --> 01:33:45.411
Captain, look, I need your help.
I want you to leave the Nexus with me.

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:50.165
We have to go back to a planet,
Veridian III.

01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:53.085
We have to stop a man called Soran
from destroying a star.

01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:56.422
Millions of lives are at stake.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:01.593
You say history considers me dead.
Who am I to argue with history?

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.138
You're a Starfleet officer!
You have a duty.

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:06.015
I don't need to be lectured by you.

01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:09.977
I was out saving the galaxy
when your grandfather was in diapers.

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:12.813
Besides which,
I think the galaxy owes me one.

01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:18.444
Oh, yeah.

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:24.325
I was like you once,

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:28.787
so worried about duty and obligation
I couldn't see past my own uniform.

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:35.753
And what did it get me?
An empty house.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.011
Not this time.

01:34:45.805 --> 01:34:50.267
This time I'm gonna walk up
these stairs, march into that bedroom

01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:53.562
and tell Antonia I want to marry her.

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:56.440
This time it's gonna be different.

01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:29.515
- This is not your bedroom.
- No, it's not. It's better.

01:35:29.891 --> 01:35:34.561
- Better?
- This is my uncle's barn in Idaho.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:39.983
I took this horse out for a ride
11 years ago on a spring day.

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:50.411
Like this one.
If I'm right, this is the day I met Antonia.

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:53.747
This Nexus of yours, very clever.

01:35:54.207 --> 01:35:58.168
I can start all over again
and do things right from day one.

01:37:35.433 --> 01:37:39.102
I must have jumped that 50 times.
Scared the hell out of me each time.

01:37:39.938 --> 01:37:41.605
Except this time.

01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:45.317
Because it isn't real.

01:37:49.781 --> 01:37:51.114
Antonia.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.992
She isn't real either, is she?

01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:58.455
Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:03.126
You know,
maybe this isn't about an empty house.

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:07.130
Maybe it's about that empty chair
on the Bridge of the Enterprise.

01:38:08.466 --> 01:38:13.470
Ever since I left Starfleet,
I haven't made a difference.

01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:27.359
- Captain of the Enterprise?
- That's right.

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:30.320
Close to retirement?

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:33.699
- I'm not planning on it.
- Let me tell you something. Don't.

01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:37.202
Don't let them promote you.
Don't let them transfer you.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:41.081
Don't let them do anything that takes you
off the Bridge of that ship,

01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:44.876
because while you're there
you can make a difference.

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:49.631
Come back with me.
Help me stop Soran.

01:38:49.716 --> 01:38:51.842
Make a difference again.

01:39:03.438 --> 01:39:07.316
Who am I to argue
with the captain of the Enterprise?

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.442
What's the name of that planet?

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:10.694
- Veridian III?
- Yes.

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:13.989
I take it the odds are against us
and the situation is grim.

01:39:14.073 --> 01:39:15.741
You could say that.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:18.785
You know, if Spock were here,

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:23.206
he'd say that I was an irrational,
illogical human being

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:25.709
for taking on a mission like that.

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:30.047
Sounds like fun.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:48.023
I have re-routed auxiliary power
to the lateral thrusters.

01:39:48.107 --> 01:39:50.233
Attempting to level our descent.

01:39:50.443 --> 01:39:52.569
All hands, brace for impact!

01:40:35.822 --> 01:40:39.866
- Just who the hell are you?
- He's James T. Kirk.

01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:43.286
Don't you read history?

01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:50.794
I've gotta get to the launcher.

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:55.674
- The ribbon will be here in a minute.
- I'll take care of Soran.

01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:35.338
Actually, I am familiar with history,
Captain,

01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:38.550
and if I'm not too much mistaken,
you're dead.

01:42:22.011 --> 01:42:23.303
I thought you were heading
for the launcher.

01:42:23.387 --> 01:42:26.389
I changed my mind.
Captain's prerogative.

01:42:50.665 --> 01:42:52.666
We need that control pad.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.632
Captain, look.

01:43:03.302 --> 01:43:04.845
Where's Soran?

01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:11.494
We're running out of time.

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:15.248
Look, the control pad,
it's still on the other side.

01:44:15.333 --> 01:44:17.125
I'll get it. You go for the launcher.

01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:20.003
No, you'll never make that by yourself.
We have to work together.

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:23.173
We are working together. Trust me. Go.

01:44:23.257 --> 01:44:25.675
- Good luck, Captain.
- Call me Jim.

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:02.105
Picard!

01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:06.026
Get away from that launcher.

01:46:09.822 --> 01:46:11.197
Now!

01:47:48.838 --> 01:47:53.550
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?

01:47:55.052 --> 01:47:59.305
Yes. We made a difference. Thank you.

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:10.400
The least I could do
for the captain of the Enterprise.

01:48:18.617 --> 01:48:23.163
It was fun.

01:48:34.633 --> 01:48:36.009
Oh, my.

01:49:59.301 --> 01:50:02.971
Captain's Log, Stardate 48650.1.

01:50:03.055 --> 01:50:05.515
Three Starfleet vessels
have arrived in orbit

01:50:05.599 --> 01:50:08.309
and have begun to beam up
the Enterprise survivors.

01:50:08.394 --> 01:50:09.852
Our casualties were light,

01:50:09.937 --> 01:50:14.190
but unfortunately, the Enterprise herself
cannot be salvaged.

01:50:14.692 --> 01:50:17.235
It has been extremely difficult,
Counselor.

01:50:17.319 --> 01:50:21.197
Well, then, why did you decide
not to remove the emotion chip?

01:50:21.282 --> 01:50:25.952
At first, I was unprepared for
the unpredictable nature of emotions.

01:50:26.704 --> 01:50:31.457
However, having experienced
261 distinct emotional states,

01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:34.794
I believe I have learned
to control my feelings.

01:50:34.878 --> 01:50:37.255
They will no longer control me.

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:39.757
Well, I hope you're successful, Data.

01:50:41.885 --> 01:50:44.012
Data, over here. I found something.

01:50:45.764 --> 01:50:47.765
One life sign, very faint.

01:51:01.697 --> 01:51:03.114
Spot!

01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:09.329
I'm very happy to see you, Spot.

01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:13.916
Another family reunited.

01:51:17.963 --> 01:51:20.673
Data, are you all right?

01:51:23.135 --> 01:51:25.803
I am uncertain, Counselor.

01:51:25.888 --> 01:51:30.475
I am happy to see Spot, yet I am crying.

01:51:33.437 --> 01:51:35.980
Perhaps the chip is malfunctioning.

01:51:37.733 --> 01:51:40.068
I think it's working perfectly.

01:51:47.951 --> 01:51:49.035
Hello, Spot.

01:51:55.626 --> 01:51:57.043
Is this it?

01:51:58.837 --> 01:52:03.049
Yes. Yes, that's it, Number One.
Thank you.

01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:13.434
I'm gonna miss this ship.
She went before her time.

01:52:16.772 --> 01:52:22.652
Someone once told me that time was
a predator that stalked us all our lives,

01:52:22.736 --> 01:52:25.571
but I rather believe
that time is a companion

01:52:25.656 --> 01:52:27.865
who goes with us on the journey,

01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:34.038
reminds us to cherish every moment
because they'll never come again.

01:52:37.334 --> 01:52:41.129
What we leave behind is not
as important as how we've lived.

01:52:42.798 --> 01:52:45.633
After all, Number One,
we're only mortal.

01:52:47.052 --> 01:52:50.304
Speak for yourself, sir.
I plan to live forever.

01:52:55.519 --> 01:52:58.980
I always thought
I'd get a shot at this chair one day.

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:02.608
Perhaps you still will.

01:53:02.943 --> 01:53:05.987
Somehow, I doubt that
this will be the last ship

01:53:06.071 --> 01:53:08.322
to carry the name Enterprise.

01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:19.792
Picard to Farragut. Two to beam up.
