00:21.380 --> 00:23.900
Dr. Zheleznova-Burdukovskaya...

00:23.980 --> 00:28.060
I'm becoming weary of explaining to you
Roman Godfrey's receiving gene therapy

00:28.140 --> 00:31.900
- for a rare renal disorder.
- I know, and I am here to assist you.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.140
And I'm telling you again
your offer is appreciated,

00:34.220 --> 00:36.380
but your presence is entirely unnecessary.

00:36.460 --> 00:39.500
- But I can be of service.
- Yes, elsewhere.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.420
You're falling behind on
your other assignments.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.460
Allegation is false.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.820
Your special request is in process.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.940
- In the meantime...
- You're trying my patience, Doctor.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.140
And you are being irrational, Doctor.

00:50.220 --> 00:53.540
I suggest you stop
questioning my authority.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.900
I won't have it, do you understand?

00:55.980 --> 00:59.500
Now go, before I lose my equanimity.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.620
Yes, Doctor.

01:24.340 --> 01:25.860
Sure you know what
you're doing here, Pryce?

01:25.940 --> 01:27.660
Oh, it's actually quite simple.

01:27.740 --> 01:31.620
Your organs and tissues will be
reverted to stem cell status, one by one,

01:31.700 --> 01:35.580
and then re-differentiated
into healthy human organs,

01:35.660 --> 01:40.060
purged of the bonded retroviral
fragments that dictate upir-ism.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.340
Soon you will leave the world of upirs

01:42.420 --> 01:44.620
to take your place
amongst the world of men.

01:45.660 --> 01:49.820
Now, you may feel some minor discomfort.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.940
But your nervous system is configured
in such a way that it's essentially

01:53.020 --> 01:56.900
impossible for any anesthesia
to mitigate the unpleasantness.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.540
And I need you responsive and
conscious during the treatment.

02:00.540 --> 02:02.780
Is there nothing you can
do to control the pain?

02:03.860 --> 02:05.700
Think happy thoughts.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.460
Almost finished. You've
done marvelously, Roman.

03:14.740 --> 03:15.780
What's that?

03:15.900 --> 03:18.220
It's a solution of hunter-seeker prions

03:18.300 --> 03:21.820
with a rapidly oscillating pH
factor that takes it off the table

03:21.900 --> 03:25.860
of acids and bases at 60 cycles per second.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.980
I think you'll find it quite refreshing.

03:47.180 --> 03:49.940
Session one went extremely well.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.180
Only five more to go.

04:48.060 --> 04:51.620
An immature Thomson's gazelle
sips, oblivious to the approach

04:51.700 --> 04:55.980
of a 14-foot Crocodylus
suchus, or African desert croc.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.540
And this guy's got dinner in mind.

04:58.620 --> 05:01.140
With a bite of 5,000
pounds per square inch,

05:01.220 --> 05:03.180
the fate of the young gazelle is sealed,

05:03.300 --> 05:06.460
- its death bloody and swift.
- Such is the way of the world.

05:07.220 --> 05:09.540
When Nature Gets Hungry.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.420
Damn.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.820
- When we return, recent sightings...
- I'm late.

05:14.900 --> 05:17.220
... of the giant vampire bat,
thought to have gone ext...

05:18.820 --> 05:21.380
Every moment without you will be torture.

05:21.460 --> 05:23.100
Oh, I'm sure you'll survive.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.700
- Bye, Peter.
- Bye.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.860
Hm.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.860
You should have a real breakfast.
Most important meal of the day.

05:47.058 --> 05:50.481
Damn it. Chasseur's
back. His car is outside.

05:50.860 --> 05:54.420
Don't worry. I told you, I
arranged for the Fazedin brothers...

05:54.500 --> 05:56.240
Shhh!

05:56.660 --> 05:59.020
To say we were all together
playing bocce yesterday.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.220
- Those were taken five days ago.
- Who's to know?

06:09.420 --> 06:12.820
The true warrior runs today
and lives to fight another day.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.660
You find something?

06:32.380 --> 06:35.620
When was the last time
you talked to your mom?

06:35.700 --> 06:38.940
I saw her yesterday. She was being
transferred to another facility.

06:40.140 --> 06:42.500
Didn't go exactly
according to plan, did it?

06:42.580 --> 06:44.860
The transport vehicle was
found by the side of the road.

06:44.940 --> 06:46.540
- Your mother was gone.
- What?

06:46.620 --> 06:47.940
Well, then you better go and find her!

06:48.020 --> 06:50.180
It's on my list.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.780
Everybody likes to do a
little something special

06:55.860 --> 06:57.940
every now and then for their mom.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.780
I usually hold it to buying flowers,

06:59.860 --> 07:03.140
but then my mother's not wanted
on multiple felony counts.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.580
- So, what's your point?
- I don't need to pursue this

07:05.660 --> 07:09.180
particular clusterfuck with any
special vigor at this moment.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.380
- I've got a full plate.
- What do you want from me?

07:18.700 --> 07:22.180
You learn anything concerning
my sister, you come to me.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.340
We're gonna work together, right?

07:24.420 --> 07:26.500
And if I find you're withholding on me,

07:26.580 --> 07:30.060
I will move heaven and earth
to fuck you up. Understand?

07:30.140 --> 07:32.380
Yeah, I get it.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.580
I know exactly what you are.

07:44.020 --> 07:47.820
- And what's that?
- A means to an end.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.740
Dr. Zheleznova-Burdukovskaya.
Please come in.

08:15.820 --> 08:18.780
Spasibo, Mrs. Godfrey.

08:28.700 --> 08:32.299
To your health, Mrs. Godfrey.

08:32.380 --> 08:33.940
Vashe zdorov'ye.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.059
To what do I owe this?

08:44.140 --> 08:47.860
Pryce thinks I'm stupid
enough to believe his lies.

08:47.940 --> 08:51.340
He treat me like dirt. But I know truth.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.420
What is the truth?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.700
Are you aware, Mrs. Godfrey, that your son

08:56.780 --> 09:00.700
is receiving special medical
treatments from Dr. Pryce?

09:01.620 --> 09:04.060
- What's wrong with him?
- As I suspected.

09:04.140 --> 09:06.740
Nobody hasn't not told you nothing.

09:06.820 --> 09:11.220
Mrs. Godfrey, you might find
what I'm next saying to you

09:11.340 --> 09:15.180
- is, in nature, quite shocking.
- Hm. I doubt it.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.340
What the good Dr. Pryce
doesn't realize is that

09:18.420 --> 09:20.860
I know he has agreed to help Roman

09:20.940 --> 09:25.340
rid himself of his upir-ism forever.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.100
I have no idea what you're talking about.

09:29.180 --> 09:32.340
When I was young apparatchitsa,

09:32.420 --> 09:36.540
I took my studies at Murmansk
Institute for Advanced Genetics,

09:36.620 --> 09:38.820
where I identified your kind

09:38.900 --> 09:44.220
as heritable N4P retroviral anomalies.

09:44.340 --> 09:48.940
What the peasants referred to as...

09:49.020 --> 09:51.660
"The blood hungry."

09:51.740 --> 09:54.340
The asylums were full of them.

09:54.420 --> 09:58.460
It was only through observation

09:58.540 --> 10:02.460
and a little snooping that I realized

10:02.540 --> 10:04.900
you and your son were of this tribe.

10:04.980 --> 10:09.380
Does Pryce know you're here?
Did he put you up to this?

10:09.460 --> 10:10.980
Pryce is...

10:14.980 --> 10:19.660
He is a dog who eats his own feces
and thinks it's sirloin steak.

10:19.740 --> 10:22.460
What do you want, money?
Is that what you're after?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.540
I not want your money.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.220
I can be quite helpful to you.

10:28.340 --> 10:31.140
And someday you will do favor for me.

10:31.220 --> 10:37.180
A favor that's commensurate
with the scale of your gratitude.

10:38.660 --> 10:42.060
Pryce badly underestimates me.

10:42.140 --> 10:47.420
Galina Aleksandrovna
Zheleznova-Burdukovskaya

10:47.500 --> 10:49.740
is nobody's fool.

10:54.860 --> 10:56.620
Vashe zdorov'ye.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.940
I will see my own way out.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.100
She's sleeping now.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.540
Singing to her helps.

11:35.180 --> 11:38.020
You know, I know it's a...
it's a weird situation,

11:38.100 --> 11:41.420
but I thought you and
I could... I don't know,

11:41.500 --> 11:45.420
help each other out a little more
and be a little friendlier, you know?

11:58.180 --> 12:01.140
I didn't ask for this gig, Bitch.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.220
- Good morning, Olivia.
- What are you doing to my son?

13:22.340 --> 13:24.580
Olivia...

13:24.660 --> 13:27.820
... Roman has embarked on a
rather radical lifestyle change.

13:27.900 --> 13:32.580
He is physiologically expunging
all vestiges of his upir-ism.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.940
Receiving an upir-ectomy, if you will.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.620
- From you?
- Yes.

13:39.580 --> 13:42.700
Why on earth would he do such a thing?

13:42.780 --> 13:45.020
I had no idea I raised such a half-wit.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.980
- How could you do this to me?!
- I'm not doing it to you.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.700
I'm doing it for you. For us.

13:50.780 --> 13:53.700
Roman has decided to cast
away his greatest power.

13:53.780 --> 13:57.420
He'll be as docile as a kitten.
Much, much easier for us to manage.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.100
And let's call a spade a spade.

13:59.180 --> 14:00.820
He loathes you with
every fiber of his being.

14:00.900 --> 14:05.300
- You went behind my back!
- I didn't want to upset you.

14:05.380 --> 14:08.660
- I know how emotional you've been.
- Don't you dare condescend to me!

14:08.740 --> 14:10.900
You've deliberately hidden the truth.

14:11.980 --> 14:14.300
Have you ever stopped to
consider that perhaps the future

14:14.380 --> 14:17.820
no longer lies with Roman?
By electing to become human,

14:17.900 --> 14:19.900
he has deliberately chosen to incorporate

14:19.980 --> 14:23.060
accelerating bio-deterioration
in his very genes.

14:23.140 --> 14:25.540
- What?
- To die, Olivia,

14:25.620 --> 14:27.820
within the normal span of mortal years.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.740
Everything you've been fighting to avoid.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.140
It's just fucked up, is what that is.

14:36.220 --> 14:40.420
Well, maybe it's time to contemplate
a world without Roman in it.

14:42.740 --> 14:45.180
I don't kill my children...

14:46.580 --> 14:48.700
... anymore. I've changed.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.140
Well, I'm merely suggesting that
perhaps it's your granddaughter

14:51.220 --> 14:52.940
you should turn your attention to now.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.580
Oh, you think I haven't thought of her?
You think I'm some kind of a monster?

14:55.660 --> 15:00.060
"If you gaze long enough into the
abyss, the abyss gazes back into you."

15:00.140 --> 15:04.620
If he's willing to mutilate himself,
he might do the same with the child.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.420
I'll handle Roman.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.940
Your granddaughter is the key
to the survival of your lineage.

15:09.020 --> 15:12.460
She is your future.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.460
Madam, what a pleasant
surprise. Please come in.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.180
Thank you, Conway.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.140
- Is Roman in?
- He isn't.

15:29.700 --> 15:33.740
Uh... Do you know when he'll be back?

15:33.820 --> 15:35.980
No, ma'am.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.940
I came to see my grandchild.
Would you bring her to me, please?

15:40.020 --> 15:43.580
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.
- Oh, for God's sake, Conway. Why not?

15:43.660 --> 15:46.500
- I'm under strict orders.
- You disappoint me.

15:46.580 --> 15:51.740
Perhaps you'll reconsider in light of
our... many long years of friendship.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.020
What are you doing here?!

15:57.620 --> 15:58.940
You were under orders.
Why'd you let her in?

15:59.020 --> 16:04.620
It's OK, it's OK. I just had a very
informative discussion with Pryce.

16:04.700 --> 16:07.220
I know exactly what you're up to.
I just can't, for the life of me,

16:07.340 --> 16:09.460
- figure out why.
- I have no intention of

16:09.540 --> 16:12.620
living out my life as a literal parasite.

16:12.700 --> 16:16.100
Pathetic, burrowing, semi-human tick.

16:18.140 --> 16:21.220
- You have no heart.
- It's hereditary.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.100
Roman, I know I've been a
less than perfect mother...

16:26.180 --> 16:29.180
If you ever come back here again,
it won't be your tongue I'll rip out.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.460
It'll be your lungs.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.820
- Conway, will you show
this woman the door?

16:35.900 --> 16:37.820
I'll see my own way out.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.100
Madam, a word?

16:47.220 --> 16:50.620
You have a right to know. A right to know.

16:50.700 --> 16:53.820
- A right to know what?
- Street trash is what she is.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.740
- Who is?
- Shows up at the front door

16:56.820 --> 16:59.300
with some cock-and-bull story
that she's been in a car wreck.

16:59.380 --> 17:02.180
Insinuates herself into
the household and then...

17:03.220 --> 17:05.099
... straight into your son's bed.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.020
And where is she now, this street trash?

17:08.099 --> 17:10.980
Who knows? She comes
and goes as she pleases.

17:11.060 --> 17:16.339
I'm being usurped, madam. The little
whore has taken over care of the baby.

17:16.420 --> 17:18.339
Acts like she's the child's mother.

17:37.220 --> 17:41.780
Whoa. What's your dog's
name? Can I pet him?

18:06.060 --> 18:09.980
Zdrastvuite, Doctor. You wanted to see me.

18:10.060 --> 18:14.060
Yes, Doctor. It's been brought to my
attention that sensitive information

18:14.140 --> 18:17.100
is escaping from the
confines of our institution.

18:17.180 --> 18:21.020
If this is the case, I assure
you I will find person responsible

18:21.100 --> 18:22.540
and deliver proper punishment.

18:26.740 --> 18:30.780
When I hired you, or should I
say spirited you out of Basra,

18:30.860 --> 18:33.420
and created a new identity for
you, I knew you were a bulldog.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.980
But I expected you to be my bulldog.

18:36.060 --> 18:39.020
I'm going to venture a guess
that you're talking out of school.

18:39.100 --> 18:43.380
I know not what this talk
is of school and dogs.

18:44.660 --> 18:47.780
- You're an estimable scientist, Doctor.
- Spasibo.

18:47.860 --> 18:54.300
Brilliant. Yes, but also
greedy, duplicitous and cunning.

18:54.380 --> 18:58.820
Did you really think it would escape my
attention that you visited Olivia today?

18:58.900 --> 19:01.780
I knew where you were going before she did.

19:01.860 --> 19:04.380
I'm watching you, Galina.

19:04.460 --> 19:08.020
Day... and night.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.460
If I were to turn these over to Interpol,

19:31.540 --> 19:34.060
there would be a great
deal of interest in the fact

19:34.140 --> 19:36.060
that the fiction known as...

19:36.140 --> 19:41.060
"Galina Alexandrovna
Zheleznova-Burdukovskaya"...

19:42.180 --> 19:48.620
... is in reality, Alyona
Ivanovna Potyomkina-Zosimova.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.620
Who shall live and who shall die?

20:05.780 --> 20:09.500
For all intents and purposes, "Galina"
no longer exists outside this building.

20:09.580 --> 20:13.900
Cross me again, and the whole
world will know the whereabouts

20:13.980 --> 20:19.100
of the monster known as
"Alyona Smertelnaya Sterva"...

20:19.180 --> 20:20.700
Death's bitch.

20:21.820 --> 20:26.020
And you would be arrested
for harboring war criminal,

20:26.100 --> 20:29.780
formerly employed by avowed
enemy of United States.

20:29.860 --> 20:33.820
I believe that is considered
treason. Punishable by death.

20:33.900 --> 20:38.420
So you see, Doctor,
your threats ring hollow.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.940
If there is nothing more...

20:41.020 --> 20:42.500
One thing.

20:42.580 --> 20:46.100
It's been said that in the
basement of the palace in Baghdad,

20:46.180 --> 20:49.940
enemies of the state were
fed into a tree chipper

20:50.020 --> 20:52.580
by your pals, Uday and Qusay.

20:52.660 --> 20:56.900
If the victims were looked upon
favorably, they were fed headfirst.

20:57.020 --> 21:01.580
If not, feetfirst to prolong the suffering.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.100
I've often wondered what
that would feel like.

23:08.980 --> 23:11.620
Peter!

23:11.700 --> 23:13.580
Who are all these people?

23:13.660 --> 23:16.460
Just a few friends who
were passing through town.

23:16.540 --> 23:20.500
Oh, come on, Peter! Have some
fun and lighten up sometimes.

23:20.580 --> 23:23.340
There's a time and a purpose
for everything under heaven.

23:23.420 --> 23:26.140
So blondie blew you off. Ain't no biggie.

23:26.220 --> 23:29.420
If you're lucky, tonight
will be your time to get laid.

23:30.940 --> 23:33.380
Go, go, go.

23:33.460 --> 23:34.620
Ding-dong!

24:15.700 --> 24:18.860
Those are your third
cousins, Yanko and Loisa.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.460
They're in the pre-owned car business.

24:20.540 --> 24:23.860
Chop, chop, if you catch my drift.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.900
That's Shandor Bibinkian,

24:25.980 --> 24:28.900
the biggest importer of Caspian
beluga caviar in the Midwest.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.340
Nine thousand dollars a kilo,

24:30.420 --> 24:33.580
and he steps all over it with
that cheap domestic stuff.

24:33.660 --> 24:36.620
Americans are pigs. They
don't know the difference.

24:36.700 --> 24:40.220
That's my ex-brother-in-law,
Boiko. He's a periodontist.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.300
- And?
- And what?

24:44.380 --> 24:46.820
He has a very nice practice in Scranton.

24:53.020 --> 24:57.460
These are your people,
Peter. This is your family.

24:57.540 --> 24:59.500
Someday, when you're ready,

24:59.580 --> 25:02.540
you'll come back and take
your place where you belong.

25:09.140 --> 25:12.740
"A little boy.

25:12.820 --> 25:15.620
His name is Fred.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.380
His name is Fred.

25:18.460 --> 25:22.620
His pr... pride...

25:22.700 --> 25:24.060
... and joy.

25:24.140 --> 25:27.780
A shiny sled."

25:32.500 --> 25:35.580
"A lit... little boy.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.020
His name is Fred."

25:45.020 --> 25:48.940
Oh, you're having a
party. I tried to call you.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.460
- Uh, you did?
- Yeah. I couldn't get you,

25:51.540 --> 25:55.900
so I just stopped by. I felt bad that
we never talked after, you know...

25:55.980 --> 25:59.540
- Obviously, I picked the wrong night.
- No, it's not the wrong night.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.020
There is no wrong nights.

26:02.660 --> 26:05.740
- I mean, do you wanna come in?
- Uh, sure.

26:05.820 --> 26:09.420
- Are these your friends?
- No.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.293
Come in, we're celebrating!

26:11.295 --> 26:12.581
What are you celebrating?

26:12.660 --> 26:14.700
Do you need a reason to celebrate?

26:17.780 --> 26:20.740
I could use a party right about now.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.060
Aah!

27:01.460 --> 27:02.460
- Peter.
- What?

27:02.540 --> 27:03.980
Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.940
Show this mountain of blubber who's boss.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.980
Show him what a Rumancek's made of.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.940
Ten dollar bets!

27:13.020 --> 27:16.700
Name your odds. No takers?

27:32.380 --> 27:34.900
- Ha!
- Oh!

27:37.620 --> 27:39.500
All right, all right.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.020
Whoa.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.420
Miranda, meet Loisa.

27:45.500 --> 27:49.820
Loisa? That's a girl's name, isn't it?

27:51.580 --> 27:53.380
Oh!

27:56.740 --> 27:59.380
It's like my Uncle
Farley always used to say.

27:59.460 --> 28:02.460
"It's not how you do a
thing, it's getting it done."

28:02.540 --> 28:06.060
- And what did he do?
- He dropped a cinderblock on his foot.

28:06.140 --> 28:08.980
And he collected disability
for the rest of his life.

28:10.380 --> 28:13.540
I've got a powerful thirst.

28:41.860 --> 28:43.180
Shhh.

28:49.940 --> 28:53.460
"Her sled is blue."

29:21.660 --> 29:23.500
It's nice.

29:27.420 --> 29:29.820
Your friends are funny.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.940
I like them.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.500
They're... they're completely full of shit,

29:34.580 --> 29:38.500
and... and yet completely not
full of shit. You know what I mean?

29:39.380 --> 29:42.020
I think I do.

29:42.100 --> 29:47.060
Kind of full of shit, and
not so full of shit. Right?

29:48.820 --> 29:50.300
Yeah.

29:51.580 --> 29:53.020
They seem happy.

29:53.100 --> 29:55.580
Most of them don't have a pot to piss in.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.860
I know what that's like.

29:59.940 --> 30:02.100
My parents kicked me out when I was 16.

30:02.180 --> 30:06.300
I didn't turn any tricks,

30:06.380 --> 30:10.740
but... I did a lot of
weird stuff to get by.

30:11.740 --> 30:15.220
- I used to sell my blood for money.
- Huh?

30:16.300 --> 30:18.220
Didn't pay much, but, uh...

30:19.500 --> 30:22.540
... I like the idea there are
all these people walking around

30:22.620 --> 30:26.220
with my cells inside them. Like, uh...

30:26.340 --> 30:30.220
... maybe I did some sick
people some good. You know?

30:35.220 --> 30:37.020
Your car's gonna be ready tomorrow.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.460
Or, at least, as ready
as it's ever gonna be.

30:46.540 --> 30:50.900
I, uh, "lost" the invoice
behind Templar's desk.

30:52.900 --> 30:56.380
- You don't think he's gonna find out?
- He'll never know.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.340
Thank you.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.580
This town is just so...

31:12.660 --> 31:14.780
I gotta get moving, you know?

31:15.820 --> 31:17.740
Yeah, I get it.

31:18.780 --> 31:21.180
Send me a postcard when you get there.

31:22.220 --> 31:23.980
Sure.

31:30.620 --> 31:32.900
Take me to your room.

31:32.980 --> 31:35.620
There's too many people out here.

31:44.100 --> 31:46.660
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Ah!

31:46.740 --> 31:49.460
Oh, did I step on your face?

31:49.540 --> 31:53.140
- I think I stepped on that guy's face.
- Hey, hey! Aw, man!

32:27.580 --> 32:29.860
Something wrong?

32:40.620 --> 32:43.620
Are... Are you crying?

34:23.980 --> 34:27.980
How does that feel? Huh?
Tell me how it feels!

34:28.060 --> 34:31.100
What about this? What about
your mother? You little fucker!

34:31.179 --> 34:33.659
Please! It hurts!

34:33.739 --> 34:36.020
It hurts!

34:36.100 --> 34:38.500
How's that feel, you little piece of shit?

34:38.580 --> 34:41.699
Huh? You want some more...

34:43.580 --> 34:46.060
No!

35:17.660 --> 35:19.620
J... Jason!

35:21.980 --> 35:25.780
I'm s... sorry.

35:48.860 --> 35:51.940
- Shelley, get in! Get in!
- Uncle...

35:52.020 --> 35:54.900
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.940
Hello? Hello?

37:00.180 --> 37:03.140
Norman. It's late.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.100
You're the last person I expected...

37:05.180 --> 37:07.700
For Christ's sake, Pryce, will
you just for once in your life

37:07.780 --> 37:09.300
shut the fuck up and listen?

37:09.380 --> 37:12.460
I'm shutting the fuck up and
listening as per your instructions.

37:12.540 --> 37:15.180
- Make it quick, before I decide...
- I got Shelley.

37:18.740 --> 37:21.900
- My God. How is she?
- Well, she's alive and safe

37:21.980 --> 37:25.460
for the moment. Listen, she's
hurt and I'm gonna need your help.

37:25.540 --> 37:28.180
A whole shit storm's gonna come
howling if we don't act fast.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.340
I understand, Norman.

37:29.420 --> 37:32.460
Meet me at the White Tower.
Come through the delivery gate.

37:32.540 --> 37:34.860
I'll have the surveillance system
shut down and we'll move her

37:34.940 --> 37:36.220
into a top security suite.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.700
How badly is she injured?

37:37.780 --> 37:40.660
Nothing the great and
terrible Pryce can't handle.

37:59.340 --> 38:02.460
For the longest while, I've been trying
to figure out what your hustle is.

38:03.580 --> 38:04.940
I don't have a hustle.

38:05.020 --> 38:09.340
You think it's my style to arrive by
car crash and screw my way through town?

38:09.420 --> 38:11.460
You're sleeping with Roman.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.620
How's it any of your business?

38:14.700 --> 38:17.980
Let me tell you what I
think's going down here.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.300
I don't believe there ever was a car crash.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.740
What are you, crazy?

38:22.820 --> 38:24.140
I know a grift when I see one.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.020
You find yourself a poor, little, rich boy,

38:26.100 --> 38:27.580
you park your car in front of his house

38:27.660 --> 38:29.340
and then you get your partner
to ram it into the ditch.

38:29.420 --> 38:31.100
I bet you weren't even in
the car when it happened.

38:31.180 --> 38:34.300
- I don't have a partner.
- You show up at rich boy's door,

38:34.380 --> 38:38.300
"Oh, I have a scratch on my head.
I've had a terrible accident."

38:38.380 --> 38:42.140
He takes you in, and then you
worm your way into the sack

38:42.220 --> 38:44.860
and give it to him like
he's never had it before.

38:44.940 --> 38:48.820
"Oh, Daddy! Oh, you're so big!

38:48.900 --> 38:50.260
- Oh, I'm coming so hard... "
- Fuck you!

38:50.340 --> 38:52.220
"I think I'm gonna explode!"

38:52.700 --> 38:55.780
You get him all cranked up, working him,

38:55.860 --> 38:56.900
then you start looking around for

38:56.980 --> 38:58.500
somebody to drive him
crazy with jealousy with.

38:58.980 --> 39:01.100
This is where you get lucky.

39:01.180 --> 39:03.980
'Cause you find yourself
a guy with soulful eyes,

39:04.060 --> 39:07.620
who just happens to
work at the repair shop.

39:07.700 --> 39:10.020
So you use repair shop boy as your patsy.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.020
I mean, it's almost too easy.

39:13.100 --> 39:16.780
But what you don't know is, there
are two things you don't know.

39:16.860 --> 39:23.220
One, Roman is a whole pile of evil shit
that you don't even begin to understand.

39:23.340 --> 39:26.700
Two, Peter has a tender heart,
and a cousin who loves him,

39:26.780 --> 39:29.940
and if you hurt him, I will
put so much pain on you,

39:30.020 --> 39:33.300
- you will never get well.
- I gotta go.

39:33.380 --> 39:35.500
Hey, you saw an opportunity
and you worked it.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.460
I get that.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.740
I've done worse, trust me.

39:39.820 --> 39:42.420
It's a rough world and a
girl's gotta make a buck.

39:42.500 --> 39:46.500
But you, girlfriend, gotta
go make it somewhere else.

39:47.660 --> 39:50.300
So I'm just telling you this
for your own good, Miranda.

39:50.380 --> 39:54.380
So go pack up your stuff, hit the road,

39:54.460 --> 39:57.660
and don't you ever come back here.

39:57.740 --> 40:00.740
It will end very badly
for you if you don't.

40:11.020 --> 40:13.900
Glowworm, you've lost your glow.

40:13.980 --> 40:17.100
But you found your voice.
I'm so proud of you.

40:17.180 --> 40:19.820
I never gave up hope.

40:19.900 --> 40:24.020
You're safe now. No one
ever need know you're here.

40:24.100 --> 40:27.540
Where's my uncle?

40:28.620 --> 40:31.220
He's gathering your family.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.340
You don't look happy.

40:33.420 --> 40:38.100
I am, of course.

40:43.940 --> 40:49.500
Long life, Monkeyman. Long life with me.

40:49.580 --> 40:53.220
This hand, I like it,
it feels good on my...

40:53.340 --> 40:56.020
- Where's Miranda?
- Gone.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.660
- What do you mean, gone?
- I mean not here.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.060
Why didn't you stop her?

41:02.140 --> 41:04.100
Stop her? I'm the one who sent her packing.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.780
- Why?
- She's working you, Peter.

41:07.860 --> 41:10.740
You're not seeing it.

41:10.820 --> 41:13.660
Well, you are way out of line here, D.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.060
You know he's fucking her, right?

41:17.820 --> 41:20.340
- She tell you that?
- I'm hoping she's on the road

41:20.420 --> 41:22.620
to wherever it is she thinks
she's going and not looking back.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.900
Even if you're right, I
at least gotta say goodbye.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.100
Give me the keys to your car.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.700
- Please, D?
- No.

41:35.020 --> 41:36.740
Go easy on the clutch.

41:38.180 --> 41:41.820
- Thanks.
- Ah. Take this.

41:59.900 --> 42:02.420
Where have you been?

42:03.100 --> 42:06.020
- I was with Peter.
- Peter?

42:08.700 --> 42:11.020
And we were at a party.

42:11.100 --> 42:14.220
And yes, I slept with him.

42:17.220 --> 42:19.580
Where are you going?

42:19.660 --> 42:23.540
I'm leaking like a fire hydrant.
I'm going to feed your child.

42:24.620 --> 42:27.340
Unless you want to do it.

42:41.700 --> 42:45.020
I missed you so much. Come here. Come here.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.540
Oh...

42:51.340 --> 42:53.100
Shhh.

42:53.180 --> 42:55.180
It's OK, it's OK.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.900
I bet you've never even felt
the sunshine on your face.

42:57.980 --> 43:00.580
Shhh.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.420
Oh, I bet you haven't.

43:03.500 --> 43:07.460
It's not right. Oh.

43:07.540 --> 43:10.340
Well, I don't care what anyone says.

43:10.420 --> 43:12.980
I'm taking you out of this mausoleum.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.820
- What can I do for you, Roman?
- I feel like I'm dying.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.860
Thick yellow pus is running out of my ear.

43:24.940 --> 43:27.140
That's a good thing. Your
body's purging itself.

43:27.220 --> 43:31.700
You are not dying. It's like chemo,
you're reacting to the treatment.

43:31.780 --> 43:34.900
Part of you is dying, but
part of you is being reborn.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.900
Thick yellow pus is running out of my ear!

43:37.980 --> 43:40.420
So you said. Look, Roman,
nobody said it was going to be

43:40.500 --> 43:42.220
a walk in the park.

43:46.340 --> 43:49.740
There you go.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.660
Aw.

43:56.580 --> 43:58.820
Come here.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.560
Hi, Honey.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.740
What are we gonna call you, little miss?

44:15.100 --> 44:18.060
I don't feel hopeless
anymore when I'm with you.

44:31.540 --> 44:33.420
Can someone please get the door?

44:43.140 --> 44:44.740
Where is she?

44:44.820 --> 44:47.620
Miranda! Miranda!

45:06.780 --> 45:08.789
What's wrong with you?

45:08.791 --> 45:11.621
I have no idea.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.540
You never said you had a baby.

45:39.460 --> 45:41.580
It's not my baby.

45:43.420 --> 45:44.580
It's Letha's.

45:48.460 --> 45:50.300
When were you gonna tell me?

45:55.380 --> 45:57.940
What's her name? What's her name?

46:01.700 --> 46:05.940
Nadia. Her name's Nadia.

46:06.020 --> 46:08.220
Here. It means "hope."

46:10.340 --> 46:11.780
Nadia.

46:16.660 --> 46:19.180
You're perfect.

46:22.860 --> 46:24.740
I loved your mother, you know?

46:28.580 --> 46:31.980
She's tired. And she needs to be changed.

46:36.540 --> 46:39.300
I'll see you soon, Nadia, OK?

47:28.580 --> 47:32.220
I wanted to tell you, but you
split, and I didn't know what to do.

47:33.140 --> 47:35.420
I needed you, and you left me.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.660
I was completely fucking lost.

47:40.860 --> 47:42.500
I am completely fucking lost.

47:42.580 --> 47:46.500
Then Miranda fell out of
the sky, and it was like...

47:46.580 --> 47:47.980
I don't know how to explain it.

47:48.060 --> 47:51.580
I don't understand. Were you
planning on hiding this baby forever?

47:51.660 --> 47:53.900
I didn't have a plan.

47:55.220 --> 47:58.900
I still don't. There's
still so much you don't know.

47:58.980 --> 48:03.740
It's OK. There's time.

48:06.340 --> 48:07.940
Where would we be without our secrets?

48:28.500 --> 48:33.140
You were called to lose your humanity.

48:33.220 --> 48:35.300
To regain it.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.580
And you couldn't do it.

48:41.300 --> 48:43.060
You were weak.

49:05.700 --> 49:08.100
Ego te absolvo.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.540
Rest well, brother.

49:36.540 --> 49:39.740
"It may be that when we no
longer know what to do...

49:40.940 --> 49:42.860
... we have come to our real work.

49:42.940 --> 49:46.980
And that when we no longer
know which way to go,

49:47.060 --> 49:49.500
we have come to our real journey.

49:49.580 --> 49:53.900
The mind that is not
baffled is not employed.

49:56.100 --> 49:59.660
The impeded stream is the one that sings."

50:02.220 --> 50:03.860
I've always loved that poem.

50:04.940 --> 50:07.100
I've never met anybody like you two.

50:08.780 --> 50:11.940
Wounded, brave...

50:13.700 --> 50:16.180
... ridiculous, weird.

50:19.300 --> 50:21.540
You have a wild heart, Peter.

50:22.340 --> 50:24.540
You're tearing yourself up inside.

50:24.620 --> 50:28.020
And you'll probably end up
dead, way before your time.

50:29.340 --> 50:31.380
You blow my mind.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.100
Roman Godfrey...

50:41.100 --> 50:43.500
... born to be king of the universe,

50:43.580 --> 50:47.420
and inside, you're a broken boy.

50:49.540 --> 50:52.620
You think it's better
to have people fear you.

50:54.020 --> 50:57.140
But your heart is crying all the time.

50:58.540 --> 51:00.540
At war with yourself.

51:02.100 --> 51:04.780
Dark as the inside of love.

51:08.300 --> 51:10.740
I can't stop thinking about you.

51:11.740 --> 51:15.020
I'd be crazy to not get
in my car and be gone.

51:17.980 --> 51:20.020
But I am crazy...

51:23.380 --> 51:25.420
... and I'm going to have to live with it.

51:39.380 --> 51:43.580
Well, are you coming or not?
