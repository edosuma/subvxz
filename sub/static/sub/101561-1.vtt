00:11.479 --> 00:14.348
(choir vocalizing)

00:38.839 --> 00:42.676
- You're going to
pay for my brother.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.078
- I should be the one paying.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.386
- Okay, new plan.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.188
You get Erica, we get Daniel.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.690
- Shit plan.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.328
- Okay.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.329
Fuck everything.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.498
(gun fires)
(man groans)

01:04.532 --> 01:05.533
(knife rasps)

01:05.566 --> 01:07.101
(knife thuds)
(man groans)

01:07.101 --> 01:09.603
(guns firing)

01:21.949 --> 01:22.783
(man groans)

01:22.783 --> 01:24.918
(guns firing)

01:24.918 --> 01:25.753
(man groans)

01:25.753 --> 01:28.256
(guns firing)

01:48.942 --> 01:50.110
- [Erica Voiceover] Shit.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.280
It's my turn.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.450
It's probably only fair.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.287
Considering the amount
of death I dish out,

01:59.287 --> 02:00.588
he was bound to come my way.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.758
Don't let my peaceful
expression fool you.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.795
I'm quite unhappy,
and hurt like hell.

02:10.931 --> 02:11.999
How did we get here?

02:13.301 --> 02:16.470
Well, it's all Daniel's fault.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.006
(gentle music)

03:01.349 --> 03:03.384
No, that's not Daniel.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.187
And this isn't heaven either.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.393
Here, I'm still full of life.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.795
Well, alive at least.

03:18.666 --> 03:22.703
That's me, in my special place,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.309
with a special kind of guy.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.514
This is my special kind of day.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.323
- Do you think
people can change?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.324
- I'm not that deep.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.927
- You're not
answering my question.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.061
- No.

03:48.061 --> 03:48.896
- No?

03:50.331 --> 03:52.400
- I believe people can make
changes to their lives,

03:53.534 --> 03:56.270
become vegan, religious,
taste in music,

03:56.270 --> 03:57.338
but we are who we are.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.943
Thieves steal, murderers
murder, and pedophiles, well--

04:02.943 --> 04:04.778
(gun clicking)

04:04.845 --> 04:07.180
(gun fires)

04:12.252 --> 04:14.855
(gentle music)

04:19.192 --> 04:21.061
- [Erica Voiceover]
I love crocodiles,

04:22.396 --> 04:24.432
but they give most
people the creeps.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.902
Those dead eyes, they just
stare across the water.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.905
But they're bloody clever.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.777
She catches her prey,
drags it to the bottom,

04:36.777 --> 04:39.780
weighs it down, where
it stays and rots.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.652
I love crocodiles.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.122
Merciless.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.892
Fearless.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.429
Timeless.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.743
- Sir, you're a highly
regarded client.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.244
Really highly regarded.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.246
I just think we needn't
hang up on each other again.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.082
This, it's business.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.517
We're grownups.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.519
We're not kids at some farm
trying to hit each other

05:18.519 --> 05:20.120
with clay sticks or something.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.823
Yeah.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.658
No, Wyngaard's gone.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.493
It's Daniel.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.326
Daniel Niemand?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.862
Yeah, from Accounts.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.998
Yes, sir, the fact
is, let's just,

05:30.998 --> 05:33.367
your account's 1.78
million in the red.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.006
And this call is because,

05:40.441 --> 05:43.210
see, sir, I see your wife and
children are in New Zealand?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.447
Looks fun.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.949
And that you've recently
sold your house?

05:50.851 --> 05:51.685
Congrats.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.022
Which brings me to the question,

05:55.055 --> 05:56.990
it's just really
just a question,

05:57.024 --> 05:59.693
sir, are you going to
settle your account with us,

06:00.561 --> 06:02.029
or are you gonna emigrate?

06:05.833 --> 06:06.667
Sir?

06:09.837 --> 06:10.671
Hm.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.594
(people chattering)

06:33.594 --> 06:35.496
(cellphone chimes)

06:38.499 --> 06:40.534
(cellphone chimes)

06:41.669 --> 06:44.071
(cellphone clicking)

06:48.742 --> 06:51.679
(cellphone chimes)

07:00.420 --> 07:01.221
Hey there.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.927
(girl laughing)

07:15.603 --> 07:18.271
(girl laughing)

07:22.976 --> 07:25.646
(girl laughing)

07:34.421 --> 07:35.723
- Hey, hey, you stop that.

07:37.157 --> 07:37.991
Stop it!

07:37.991 --> 07:39.292
Stop.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.460
Don't spray me, hey, don't.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.429
No, you don't, hey.
(girl laughing)

07:42.462 --> 07:43.797
Don't. Stop.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.733
Naughty child, stop that, stop.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.234
- Excuse me, what the
hell are you doing?

07:47.267 --> 07:48.135
- No, no, nothing.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.469
Leave my kid alone!

07:49.469 --> 07:50.638
- She's throwing--
- You sicko, don't touch her!

07:50.671 --> 07:51.905
I'll call the cops!
- Okay, I'll go.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.141
- [Woman] I'll call
the police, watch me.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.308
Just get away.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.813
(Pauline gasps)
(Daniel yelps)

07:59.813 --> 08:00.614
- Hey, babe.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.785
- What the fuck
happened to your suit?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.620
- A little girl threw
a doughnut at me.

08:06.654 --> 08:07.788
- What did you do?

08:07.788 --> 08:08.689
- Nothing.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.857
I just gave her a doughnut.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.625
- Why would you do that?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.527
- I was just sitting there,

08:13.527 --> 08:15.863
then she liked my doughnut,
so I thought I'd be nice

08:15.929 --> 08:17.965
and, you know, give her
the doughnut, you know.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.600
- Bloody hell, what happened?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.535
- Apparently, the girl
he was with did that.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.036
- I wasn't "with" a girl.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.337
- [Pauline] Whatever, Daniel.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.173
- Come in, no one cares.
- But, babe.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.440
Babe.
- Thank you so much.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.642
- It'll be one of the--
- Excuse me, Reverend.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.110
- Sure, sure.
- It'll be amazing.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.679
Cousin Daniel.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.946
- [Daniel] Cousin Daniel.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.215
- I'm so glad you could make it.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.216
Thank you.
- Sorry.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.852
Why is Schalk here?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.688
- You got my email about
the dress code, right?

08:40.688 --> 08:42.189
- Yeah.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.357
- Magriet will squeeze my
balls blue if I forget.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.225
(Daniel chuckles)

08:45.292 --> 08:47.360
- I can imagine.
- Daniel?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.796
- Babe.
- Oh.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.998
Oh, it's the other
Cousin Daniel.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.399
Oh.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.667
For a moment there, I
thought your friendly cousin

08:53.701 --> 08:55.002
had brought home a hobo again.

08:55.002 --> 08:55.836
(Magriet chuckles)

08:55.836 --> 08:56.837
- They're people too.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.140
- You're probably
putting something else on

09:00.173 --> 09:01.341
for the photos, right?

09:01.341 --> 09:02.342
- Don't worry
about him, Magriet.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.376
He'll look perfect.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.344
Come.
- Excuse me.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.514
- There's a bit on your nose.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.652
Oh, come on,

09:11.652 --> 09:12.853
it's totally fine.
- It's your family.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.588
- It's fine, they'll
clean him up.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.389
- Ugh.
- It's fine.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.558
It's fine, babes,
just breathe, babes.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.399
- I thought your dad
walking out on us

09:26.433 --> 09:27.935
would be the biggest disgrace.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.837
- Mom, it really
wasn't my fault.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.772
- Why do you keep
doing this to me?

09:31.772 --> 09:32.706
- Doing what?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.107
- [Jozette] Ugh, what a mess.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.276
- This was one of
Daniel's old ones.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.277
It might fit.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.846
- That was the best I could do.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.215
Mm.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.121
- I wanted to do this
sooner, but you were late.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.556
- I'm not having a great day.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.958
- Schalk and I are together.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.629
- Schalk?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.765
Our marriage counselor Schalk?

09:57.765 --> 09:58.598
- Yes.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.269
- Since when?

10:05.072 --> 10:08.241
- I would say somewhere
around the third session.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.943
One of our individual sessions.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.079
It was one thing
and then another.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.914
You know how these
things happen.

10:13.914 --> 10:14.748
- Have you two...

10:16.483 --> 10:17.651
- It doesn't really matter.

10:17.718 --> 10:18.986
- Doesn't matter?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.320
- No, I wanna chat
about something else.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.789
- Chat?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.423
- It's Schalk's
professional opinion

10:23.456 --> 10:27.060
that if I wanna be healed,
we should get divorced.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.002
He says he's seen this
happen to lots of couples.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.407
- Maybe we should
just connect a bit.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.274
Come here, just--
- Mm-mm.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.642
- Just come here.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.680
Is this about the money?

10:46.680 --> 10:47.915
'Cause if it's about the money--

10:47.948 --> 10:49.449
- Daniel, please,
just sign the papers.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.085
I won't ask for anything.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.154
I just want the house.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.123
And the money.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.762
But all your things are at
your apartment, anyway, right?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.530
Things are actually
working out wonderfully,

11:03.530 --> 11:04.597
don't you think?

11:04.631 --> 11:05.866
Go on, Daniel, take this off.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.867
God, it stinks.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.271
(girl squealing)

11:17.144 --> 11:18.145
- [Man] Taking these photos--

11:18.145 --> 11:18.979
- Mom?
- Before the wedding's

11:18.979 --> 11:19.880
a great idea.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.281
- Cousin Daniel has always been

11:21.314 --> 11:22.182
forward thinking.
- We have to talk.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.016
- Oh.
- Thank you.

11:23.016 --> 11:23.851
- Yes, pardon me.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.519
- So she gave it to you.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.723
- Mom?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.324
- You're holding
her back, Daniel.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.192
- Back from what?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.827
- She's outgrown you.

11:33.861 --> 11:37.497
I mean, you're without
any ambition, and
lately, so passive.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.900
It must have been
very frustrating for
her, I can imagine.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.734
- Hi.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.738
- I'm sorry, son, but everyone
thinks it's for the best.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.374
- Who's "everyone"?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.743
- It's all my fault, Pauline.
- Mom.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.244
Mom?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.213
- I should've known after
30 hours in labor...

11:54.347 --> 11:55.849
Just like his dad.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.550
Imagine what could've been
if I'd rather introduced you

11:57.550 --> 11:58.651
to our dear Cousin Daniel.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.220
- Oh, don't worry, Mom.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.355
I really loved your
Daniel very much,

12:02.389 --> 12:03.991
once upon a time.
- We all did.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.260
At least, now, you have Schalk.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.495
- [Pauline] Oh, yes.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.562
- [Schalk] Hey, Daniel.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.530
- Hey, Schalk.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.431
Schalk.
- Hm?

12:14.001 --> 12:16.003
Okay, look at me.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.272
Everything will be okay.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.440
I promise.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.508
Okay?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.509
This is for the best.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.343
Come here.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.177
Just like we practiced.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.245
In deep.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.079
That's it.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.883
And out, okay, cool.

12:29.917 --> 12:30.918
Chat with you later.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.221
- Chat?
- All right, is everyone here?

12:34.221 --> 12:37.724
All right, can the
family please step up?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.227
Bride and groom in the middle.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.528
- See you soon, all right?
- See you soon.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.729
- [Photographer] Uh-huh,
all right, that's good.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.798
All right, Granny,
Grandpa, over here.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.469
Yeah, all right, let's get all
the children to squeeze in.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.240
All right, yeah, it's
starting to look nice.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.074
- Cuz.
- Hm?

12:55.308 --> 12:57.144
- He's not in the color scheme.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.111
- He's my cousin.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.712
- What about the color scheme?

12:59.746 --> 13:00.914
- Schalk is in the color scheme.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.049
- What?
- Come on.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.116
- Oh, Schalk.
- No, no, no, I can't.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.217
- Come on.
- It's not my place.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.152
If you insist.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.587
I love photos!

13:09.122 --> 13:10.223
- [Magriet] Oh, perfect.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.562
- [Schalk] Oh, this
just feels right.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.565
- [Photographer] Oh,
yeah, this looks good.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.234
Excuse me. You.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.435
- Yeah?
- What's your name?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.803
- Daniel.
- Would you mind

13:23.803 --> 13:25.138
holding the ladder, please?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.008
- No, no, all right.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.642
- [Photographer] Oh,
thank you, Daniel.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.313
All right, (grunts) here we go.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.450
All right, okay,
I'll count to three,

13:37.450 --> 13:39.519
then all of you say "family!"

13:39.519 --> 13:41.521
One, two, three.
- Family!

13:41.588 --> 13:43.423
(camera snaps)

13:43.423 --> 13:44.491
- [Photographer]
One, two, three.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.859
Family!
- Family!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.963
- Family!
(man laughs)

13:49.963 --> 13:52.132
(horn honks)

13:52.132 --> 13:54.001
(policeman whistles)

13:54.001 --> 13:56.336
- [Policeman]
Let's go, let's go!

13:56.369 --> 13:59.339
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.542
(policeman whistling)

14:02.609 --> 14:05.278
(siren wailing)

14:07.047 --> 14:09.449
(people chattering)

14:09.482 --> 14:12.986
(police radio chattering)

14:13.853 --> 14:17.024
(helicopter whirring)

14:26.366 --> 14:28.335
- [Erica Voiceover]
I love dark humor,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.905
but a chopped up body in a shape
of a smiley face on a beach

14:31.905 --> 14:34.174
is a bit much, even for me.

14:35.675 --> 14:39.012
When you're a civil servant,
a sense of humor is crucial,

14:40.547 --> 14:43.383
but this is a big middle finger
for a grumpy, old bugger.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.256
Detective Johannes Ackerman.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.594
- Has the body been
identified yet?

14:56.829 --> 14:59.832
- Yes, a certain
Petrus Wyngaard.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.402
Or, at least, bits of him.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.238
- Mm.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.574
Well, whoever did this
has a sick sense of humor.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.612
- Apparently, one of Frank's
previous accountants.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.614
(dog barking)

15:14.681 --> 15:16.849
- [Woman] Oh, jeez, get
your dog under control!

15:16.849 --> 15:17.951
- [Frank] Hey, fuck off!

15:17.951 --> 15:19.619
- Speak of the devil.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.454
Frank Redelinghuys.

15:21.454 --> 15:25.792
(choir singing in
foreign language)

15:47.447 --> 15:49.983
Are you the latest oil
tanker to crash the beach?

15:50.050 --> 15:51.784
What are you doing here, Frank?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.421
- How are retirement
plans coming along?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.722
I suggest you take it easy,

15:55.722 --> 15:58.125
you know, for the
last few weeks.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.892
One wouldn't want
to break a hip, huh?

15:59.926 --> 16:01.894
(men laughing)

16:01.894 --> 16:03.230
I hope the minister of police

16:03.230 --> 16:06.399
will at least wash your
feet the day you leave.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.601
- You want one of my
feet up your ass, Frank?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.339
- If you worked for me.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.507
I like to thank my
employees personally

16:14.507 --> 16:16.343
on the day they
leave my service.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.747
- People appreciate the
personal touch, Frank.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.449
- Yes, that's true, isn't it?

16:22.449 --> 16:25.185
- Mm-hm.
- Yes, I think so too.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.186
- [Policeman] Captain.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.790
- [Frank] A little something
for your selfless service.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.760
- [Xander] What's that?

16:34.761 --> 16:36.363
- A warrant.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.930
- That's the first
one you gave me.

16:37.964 --> 16:41.434
I kept it for 20 long years.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.970
I thought you might
want to frame it.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.672
Enjoy your day, Captain.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.807
Always a pleasure.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.043
Come.

16:52.945 --> 16:53.880
- [Johannes] Shit!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.115
- Captain!
- What?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.184
- [Xander] The scene
can't be, you know...

16:59.952 --> 17:02.889
- Ever since I put
this on 35 years ago,

17:02.889 --> 17:05.392
I haven't broken a single
municipal regulation.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.560
And you know what the
hell that got me?!

17:07.560 --> 17:08.661
Fuck all!

17:08.695 --> 17:10.029
It got me fuck all!

17:14.534 --> 17:17.137
(gentle music)

17:38.358 --> 17:43.363
(blinds clacking)
(knocking)

17:55.908 --> 17:56.743
- Daniel.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.279
Look at me.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.114
Hey!

18:03.049 --> 18:03.883
Hm?

18:05.852 --> 18:07.420
How long have you worked for me?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.592
- [Daniel] Two years
and three months.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.562
- Who saved your
ass at city council?

18:17.264 --> 18:18.097
- You did, sir.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.302
- Who appointed you Mr.
Wyngaard's position?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.370
- You did, sir.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.237
- Yes.

18:25.138 --> 18:25.938
I did that.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.444
Have you ever handed
in incomplete work?

18:34.581 --> 18:36.149
- No, sir.

18:36.149 --> 18:36.983
I'm really sorry.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.085
It won't happen again.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.721
- Is there something
I should know?

18:43.823 --> 18:46.826
(Daniel whimpering)

18:50.163 --> 18:52.665
(Frank sighs)

18:54.133 --> 18:58.671
Daniel, I only expect two
things from my employees:

18:59.906 --> 19:02.775
They must be loyal
and consistent.

19:04.811 --> 19:09.182
And a change in behavior
indicates a change in loyalty.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.918
(Daniel whimpering)

19:11.918 --> 19:13.152
Did you steal money from me?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.589
And also, did you
speak to people

19:16.589 --> 19:18.491
who perhaps you should not have?

19:18.491 --> 19:20.527
(Daniel crying)

19:20.593 --> 19:21.761
Then why are you crying?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.932
What the fuck is your problem?

19:25.965 --> 19:26.933
- My wife left me.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.204
(Daniel whimpering)

19:32.339 --> 19:34.140
Pauline left me.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.475
- Oh, yes.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.044
(Daniel whimpering)

19:38.044 --> 19:39.446
Oh, sorry, man.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.780
You know, what can I say?

19:42.282 --> 19:45.952
You know, all couples
have their issues.

19:48.154 --> 19:51.023
(Daniel whimpering)

19:51.023 --> 19:52.325
Did you go for counseling?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.695
- She left me for our counselor.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.365
(Hansie chuckles)

19:58.365 --> 20:00.032
- Hm?
- No wonder he's late

20:00.066 --> 20:01.334
with the books.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.036
(Daniel crying)

20:05.238 --> 20:06.138
- I'm sorry, sir.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.876
I shouldn't bring home to work.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.145
- You don't have to apologize.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.314
I understand.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.849
My wife and I also
had our stuff.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.885
May she rest in peace.

20:18.885 --> 20:23.089
So what do you want to do, huh?

20:23.155 --> 20:25.358
- I thought maybe if I
could have an extra week

20:25.392 --> 20:27.660
for the books, it'd help.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.728
- [Frank] Sounds good.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.697
- Thank you, sir.

20:32.399 --> 20:36.403
- Please, call me Frank.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.705
(Daniel whimpering)

20:38.705 --> 20:40.373
- [Daniel] Oh, thank you.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.241
(Daniel grunting)

20:42.241 --> 20:43.410
- [Frank] Okay.

20:51.918 --> 20:52.719
Daniel.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.357
So what are you
going to do with him?

20:57.390 --> 20:58.190
The counselor.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.227
Will you break his
nose, scratch his car?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.296
Personally, I would've
bashed his teeth out.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.263
- Or his balls.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.097
Hurts more.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.769
- I'll ask for my money
back for the counseling.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.070
At least my half.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.941
- [Frank] This guy,
what's his name?

21:14.974 --> 21:17.076
- Schalk.
- You trusted Schalk.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.411
You thought he'd
save your marriage,

21:18.411 --> 21:20.279
instead he bonked your wife.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.247
- [Daniel] I guess.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.650
- Hansie, get the car.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.785
I think we should pay
Schalk a little visit.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.387
- I'd be happy to, Frank.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.921
- Mr. Frank, I don't
wanna be any trouble.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.757
- Hansie--
- It's no trouble at all.

21:30.757 --> 21:31.824
We got you.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.893
It's good, this is good.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.595
Okay, oh, let's go.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.832
(women vocalizing)

21:45.638 --> 21:49.942
(women singing in
foreign language)

21:53.513 --> 21:55.848
Aim for the nose, it
hurts like a bitch.

21:55.848 --> 21:56.816
Or his balls.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.353
- And then we start fighting?

22:00.353 --> 22:01.854
When do we stop, like,

22:01.854 --> 22:04.357
how do I know it isn't
a fight to the death?

22:04.424 --> 22:05.792
Shouldn't we talk
about it first?

22:05.825 --> 22:07.193
Lay down some rules so
that, you know, it's--

22:07.193 --> 22:09.362
- It's simple, just punch him.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.966
- Okay.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.002
Okay.

22:16.002 --> 22:16.836
Okay!

22:24.511 --> 22:26.979
- [Hansie] So why are
we helping him, Frank?

22:26.979 --> 22:28.781
- As Dad said, a good accountant

22:28.781 --> 22:31.451
is someone smart enough
to do your books,

22:31.451 --> 22:34.286
dumb enough not to know
they've been duped,

22:34.286 --> 22:36.956
and honest enough not
to steal from you.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.157
And that's Daniel.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.028
- [Hansie] Mm.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.740
(Daniel grunting)

23:01.380 --> 23:02.214
- [Schalk] Daniel.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.349
Nice to see you again.

23:04.817 --> 23:08.187
Okay, Willem, remember,
next Tuesday, stay strong.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.591
We'll get through this.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.361
Okay, remember, those
tears are healing, right?

23:15.394 --> 23:18.731
Okay, every morning, do your
exercises in the mirror.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.033
- My name is Willem,
and I'm worth it.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.335
- Okay, okay, all right.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.837
Well done, doing great.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.373
Oh, Willem, remind
Karen to phone me

23:27.373 --> 23:29.208
for those private
sessions, okay?

23:29.208 --> 23:30.677
All right.

23:30.677 --> 23:31.511
Well done.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.180
(Schalk chuckles)

23:34.180 --> 23:37.016
Well, this was bound to happen.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.217
Come on, step inside.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.352
Come on.

23:41.921 --> 23:42.955
Looking good.

23:50.229 --> 23:54.066
Technology makes the clients
feel a bit uncomfortable.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.735
Hence the teddy bear.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.538
Teddy bears are
just so comforting.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.572
Yeah?

23:59.606 --> 24:00.406
Daniel?

24:02.408 --> 24:03.242
Have a seat.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.380
Come on.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.227
Daniel.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.631
Dan.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.765
Dan the man.

24:26.733 --> 24:30.002
You, you're better off.

24:31.437 --> 24:34.440
- Please explain how you
think I'm better off.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.342
- When it's said and
done, she cheated.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.947
And, oh, unfaithful people

24:42.314 --> 24:44.984
remain unfaithful.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.854
Yeah?

24:47.854 --> 24:49.856
It's a vicious
cycle, it never ends.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.257
- Yes, but it was with you!

24:51.290 --> 24:52.759
- Yeah.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.828
Yes, yes, it was.

24:55.828 --> 25:00.767
So who you'd feel better
having the conversation with?

25:02.268 --> 25:06.438
Because what's happening now
between you and me is real.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.941
And Pauline wanted to
keep this a secret.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.878
She wanted to hide
it in that deep, dark

25:11.878 --> 25:13.846
secret-filled hole in her soul.

25:14.781 --> 25:18.484
But I said, "No, this man,

25:18.517 --> 25:23.522
"this Daniel, deserves
a chance to move on."

25:24.356 --> 25:26.859
You deserve that new beginning.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.662
Pauline didn't want to.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.633
I came and laid myself down

25:35.134 --> 25:38.905
on the altar of your freedom
and said, "No, Pauline, no.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.975
"Take me, me."

25:45.912 --> 25:49.682
There and here

25:51.217 --> 25:53.886
and there and there
a couple times.

25:55.988 --> 25:56.823
Mm.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.559
It's been a pleasure.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.360
Mm-hm?

26:02.762 --> 26:07.700
Right, so what we
need now is closure.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.537
That rage inside you, the dark
cloud that you're feeling,

26:13.906 --> 26:16.909
and you're allowed to feel it,
you must, you must feel it.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.110
It's valid.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.212
But it needs, like, an outlet,

26:20.246 --> 26:22.414
a release, a channel
towards healing.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.755
(Schalk claps)
Come on, get up.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.557
Yes, I can feel it.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.693
Let's change this
into an exercise.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.961
Come on, come, get up.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.430
Okay, here comes a breakthrough.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.099
A breakthrough's coming,
something special,

26:40.099 --> 26:41.768
just stay with me.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.802
Take your hand, okay?

26:42.802 --> 26:44.637
Make a fist, then take its rage.

26:44.704 --> 26:45.772
Take this rage, okay?

26:45.772 --> 26:46.973
- [Daniel] Yes.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.274
- Let's name this rage.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.209
- Schalk.
- Let's go with Pauline, okay?

26:50.242 --> 26:51.243
- Pauline?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.780
- Now, push this
rage to the top,

26:53.780 --> 26:56.115
push it to your fist, okay?

26:56.148 --> 26:57.650
All right, now, say it with me:

26:57.717 --> 27:00.887
Rage, you won't get me down!

27:00.920 --> 27:03.089
- Rage, you won't--
- Louder, Daniel, louder.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.590
Rage!
- Rage.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.225
- [Both] You won't get me down.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.459
- I'm in control.
- I'm in control.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.228
- I'm in control!
- I'm in control.

27:09.261 --> 27:12.431
- Now, hit me, right here, okay?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.466
- Rage, you won't get me down.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.302
I am in control.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.737
Rage, you won't get me down.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.005
- Daniel, hit me

27:19.005 --> 27:20.673
right here, okay?
- I am in control.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.908
- Okay, you're in control.
- I am in control.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.142
You won't get me down!

27:23.142 --> 27:24.243
(punch thuds)
(Schalk groans)

27:24.276 --> 27:27.113
(Schalk coughing)

27:34.020 --> 27:34.854
Schalk?

27:36.823 --> 27:37.757
Schalk?

27:37.790 --> 27:39.158
Schalk, sit, sit, sit.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.795
What? Phone?

27:42.795 --> 27:44.330
Phone?

27:44.330 --> 27:45.998
What's your passcode?

27:45.998 --> 27:46.833
What's your...

27:50.002 --> 27:51.170
Okay, put your finger on it.

27:51.170 --> 27:51.971
Put your finger on it.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.672
Put your finger on it.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.506
Oh.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.209
Schalk? Schalk.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.310
Schalk.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.178
Schalk.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.649
(choir vocalizing)

28:03.682 --> 28:04.516
Ugh.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.898
Okay, Schalk...

28:20.632 --> 28:21.467
(Daniel blowing)

28:21.467 --> 28:22.301
Okay.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.908
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Schalk, Schalk, Schalk.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.711
Let go, hey, I'm trying to
perform a tracheotomy, okay?

28:32.745 --> 28:34.546
I'm gonna cut a hole
in your throat, okay?

28:34.546 --> 28:35.714
Okay?

28:35.714 --> 28:36.548
- Okay.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.219
(Daniel groaning)

28:40.219 --> 28:42.989
(knife clatters)

28:44.857 --> 28:47.393
(Daniel blows)

28:49.728 --> 28:52.198
(blood spatters)

28:52.231 --> 28:55.167
(blood sputtering)

29:06.946 --> 29:09.782
(static crackles)

29:10.950 --> 29:15.121
(man speaking in
foreign language)

29:23.295 --> 29:25.131
- Fuck, still waters.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.034
(Daniel mumbling)

29:38.044 --> 29:41.247
- I said "nose," not "throat."

29:42.614 --> 29:44.050
- Fucker's still alive.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.887
- Come, we must take
him to the hospital.

29:47.887 --> 29:48.720
Come on, guys.

29:50.656 --> 29:51.490
Come on.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.293
One, two, three.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.727
(both grunting)

29:55.761 --> 29:57.296
- Why do you want to save him?

29:57.296 --> 29:59.398
I would've fed him his own dick.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.632
- I made a hole in his throat

30:00.632 --> 30:02.734
after smashing him
in that same throat.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.837
I truly hope it makes
him a better person.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.606
He's slipping, he's slipping.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.474
Oh, wait.

30:11.777 --> 30:14.613
- Where did you learn that,
that thing with the pen?

30:14.613 --> 30:15.481
- [Daniel] Scouts.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.352
Sir, why do you have a gun?

30:22.154 --> 30:27.159
(Schalk gasps)
(gun fires)

30:28.027 --> 30:29.095
- The fucker gave me a fright.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.331
(keys jingling)

30:32.331 --> 30:33.832
- [Hansie] I'll be right back.

30:34.934 --> 30:35.868
- [Daniel] I'm in control.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.503
I'm in control.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.304
- I'm so sorry.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.707
- [Daniel] I'm in control.

30:48.814 --> 30:51.183
So, what, are you
guys gangsters?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.685
- [Frank] I'm not very
fond of that word.

30:53.719 --> 30:56.722
Let's just say, not
exactly above board.

30:56.788 --> 30:58.790
- Mr. Wyngaard, your
previous accountant?

30:58.790 --> 31:02.394
- Tragic accident
after he stole from me.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.462
- What about Coetzee?

31:04.463 --> 31:05.965
Van der Merwe?

31:05.998 --> 31:06.999
Le Roux?

31:06.999 --> 31:08.400
- Prostate.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.668
- [Hansie] Where does this go?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.170
- [Daniel] On the shelf.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.004
- [Hansie] Okay.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.842
- So have you touched
anything else?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.045
- I touched Schalk.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.412
- [Hansie] That
won't be a problem.

31:21.647 --> 31:22.982
- Then nothing.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.516
I promise.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.085
- We believe him, right, Hansie?

31:27.987 --> 31:29.355
Let's get rid of this thing.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.857
- [Daniel] What
will you do with it?

31:34.193 --> 31:36.762
(gentle music)

31:46.939 --> 31:49.108
- There's always some
kind of temptation.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.046
And some people simply
can't resist temptation.

31:55.714 --> 31:58.850
- Such temptations can
lead to tragic accidents.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.622
- Now, Daniel, if that
little devil comes

32:03.622 --> 32:04.923
and sits on your shoulder,

32:06.725 --> 32:09.561
then you'd better
tell him "bugger off,"

32:12.631 --> 32:13.799
because if you don't,

32:14.967 --> 32:16.768
I'll cut you up
into little pieces

32:16.768 --> 32:18.537
and feed you to my fucking dog.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.608
- I won't talk to anyone.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.442
I swear.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.445
- I didn't think you would.

32:31.817 --> 32:36.822
(punch thuds)
(Daniel groaning)

32:38.457 --> 32:41.327
- Goodness, Danny
boy, watch out.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.464
My heart isn't as
soft as my brother's.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.135
I'll eat you up myself.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.670
- [Daniel] Okay.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.504
- Great.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.246
(Daniel groaning)

33:04.983 --> 33:07.953
Shouldn't we cut him up
and chuck him in too?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.589
- [Frank] Do you want to
get in line at the IRS too?

33:14.360 --> 33:17.296
(woman vocalizing)

33:56.402 --> 33:57.869
(keys jingling)

33:57.869 --> 33:58.704
(lock clacks)

33:58.704 --> 34:00.806
(door creaks)

34:00.839 --> 34:02.308
- [Pauline] Hello?

34:03.175 --> 34:04.843
(lock clicks)

34:04.843 --> 34:05.677
Schalk?

34:08.046 --> 34:08.880
Baby?

34:12.017 --> 34:12.851
Oh.

34:14.720 --> 34:18.557
Are we playing a little
game of hide-and-seek?

34:22.361 --> 34:23.195
Schalk?

34:42.514 --> 34:44.049
- [Xander] What time
was that, ma'am?

34:49.255 --> 34:50.756
Okay, please hold.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.760
I'd wait with those
if I were you.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.798
- Don't mess with me, Louw.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.066
- Captain, there's
someone on the phone

35:01.099 --> 35:02.968
who messes around
much better than me.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.274
(choir vocalizing)

35:08.274 --> 35:09.107
- Daniel.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.210
Are you awake?

35:16.315 --> 35:18.817
I thought we had
an understanding.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.152
- [Daniel] Hm?

35:20.219 --> 35:21.487
- If someone talks
to the police,

35:21.487 --> 35:23.822
there's, unfortunately,
only one question.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.560
Beef jerky or chili bites?

35:28.560 --> 35:32.231
(dog barks)
(dog snarling)

35:32.264 --> 35:33.265
- She's saying jerky.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.135
(knife rasps)
(dog snarls)

35:37.135 --> 35:40.772
(Hansie chuckling)
(dog barking)

35:40.806 --> 35:43.475
(both laughing)

35:51.149 --> 35:54.152
(car horns honking)

35:56.087 --> 35:58.657
(Daniel sighs)

36:03.028 --> 36:04.196
(ball thuds)

36:04.196 --> 36:06.332
Those books won't do themselves.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.869
- [Daniel] I'm on it.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.271
- [Hansie] Mm-hm.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.316
- Sit down, you're
making me nervous.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.852
- My sincere apologies.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.687
I'm the only one worrying
about that little shit

36:28.720 --> 36:30.889
wandering around like a ghost.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.825
The others will notice
he's weirder than usual.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.027
- Stop giving him grief.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.363
His wife left him.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.164
That's what people will think.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.867
- [Secretary] Excuse
me, can I help you?

36:41.867 --> 36:43.702
- [Frank] The circus
is back in town.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.205
Gentlemen, you have to make
an appointment to see me,

36:47.205 --> 36:48.874
and I'm sorry, but
my schedule's full.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.342
- We're not here for you, Frank.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.176
Maybe later.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.814
- That's him, get him!

36:59.217 --> 37:01.653
Daniel Niemand, I'm
inspector Xander Louw,

37:01.653 --> 37:03.589
and I'm arresting you
for the assault on,

37:03.589 --> 37:06.592
or murder of, Schalk Bosch.

37:06.592 --> 37:09.094
You have the right to choose
your own legal representative.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.230
If you want, the state
can provide you with one.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.666
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.768
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:16.768 --> 37:19.438
Anything you say
can and will be used

37:19.505 --> 37:21.740
against you in a court of law.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.842
You have the right
to talk to a lawyer,

37:23.875 --> 37:25.877
and have them present.

37:25.877 --> 37:26.712
- Cheers, gentlemen.

37:26.712 --> 37:27.946
Enjoy your day.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.616
Seems you jumped the gun
with your farewell gift.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.017
See you at the party, Frank.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.636
- Don't you all
have work to do?!

37:52.471 --> 37:54.239
- [Policeman] Please,
don't smile, sir.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.141
(camera snaps)
Next!

37:57.643 --> 37:59.745
- What does Z stand for?
- Sir, I'm not gonna

37:59.778 --> 38:00.812
ask you again.
- Hey.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.582
- [Man In Hat] Is it Zoe?

38:03.582 --> 38:04.650
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I said leave me alone!

38:04.650 --> 38:07.152
(officers shouting)

38:07.218 --> 38:09.588
- [Man In Hat]
Hey, fuck you, man.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.822
I'm watching you!

38:10.822 --> 38:12.057
(Xander speaking in
foreign language)

38:12.090 --> 38:14.326
I'll dream about
you tonight, baby!

38:14.326 --> 38:15.794
- [Xander] Put
him in cell three!

38:15.794 --> 38:17.162
- [Man In Hat] I love you!

38:17.228 --> 38:18.897
(stapler clacks)

38:18.930 --> 38:19.831
- [Xander] All right,
give me that file.

38:19.831 --> 38:20.666
Come on.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.905
- [Daniel] Can I
use the bathroom?

38:26.905 --> 38:28.407
- [Xander] No, there's no time.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.341
- [Policeman] Next.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.447
- [Hansie] Why are
you so fucking calm?

38:36.948 --> 38:39.451
- Well, hopefully, Daniel
will bark the right tune.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.954
In which case, we'll
make his time in jail

38:42.988 --> 38:44.590
as pleasant as possible.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.093
- [Hansie] Or he's a little
tattletale and spills the beans.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.295
- Then I'll have something
to feed to my dog.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.865
Is that scene clean?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.267
- [Hansie] Of course that
scene's clean, Frank.

38:56.267 --> 38:57.769
This isn't my first rodeo.

38:57.803 --> 38:58.804
- It's bothering me.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.676
So how does Acker know?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.515
- Ooh, I want your healing.
- Just want my healing?

39:09.548 --> 39:11.950
- [Pauline] Heal me, God,
do what you have to do.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.053
I deeply need it.
- I'll give you some healing.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.221
(Pauline moans)

39:16.287 --> 39:17.322
- [Pauline] Oh, God, oh,

39:17.355 --> 39:18.524
give it to me, baby.
- Okay.

39:18.524 --> 39:19.825
- No, no, keep watching.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.560
- [Schalk] You know what
I mean when I say deep?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.361
- [Pauline] Give it to me.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.996
(Schalk moans)
Oh, I'm with you.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.231
- [Schalk] That
deep enough for you?

39:26.231 --> 39:27.399
- [Pauline] Oh, God, yeah, yeah

39:27.399 --> 39:28.333
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.801
- Why are you showing me this?

39:29.801 --> 39:31.236
- Deep.
(Pauline moaning)

39:31.236 --> 39:32.738
- How could you not
know about the camera?

39:32.804 --> 39:34.540
It's not like he
tried to hide it.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.007
- [Schalk] Do you feel that?

39:36.041 --> 39:38.877
- Yeah, your wife's a star,
in quite a few of these.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.846
Believe me, she's a star.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.347
- My ex-wife.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.181
- Ex-wife?

39:44.315 --> 39:45.884
According to her,
she was ready to make

39:45.884 --> 39:47.586
the gem's sequel last night.

39:47.653 --> 39:49.555
- Only, when she got
to Schalk's house--

39:49.555 --> 39:51.056
- There was no Schalk.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.390
- But there was this video.

39:53.592 --> 39:54.860
- [Schalk] Daniel, hit me

39:54.893 --> 39:56.394
right here, okay?
- I am in control.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.663
- Okay, you're in control.
- I am in control.

39:57.696 --> 39:58.930
You won't get me down!

39:58.930 --> 39:59.831
(Schalk groans)

39:59.865 --> 40:02.701
(Schalk coughing)

40:04.402 --> 40:06.572
- Seriously, though, didn't
you realize there was a camera?

40:06.572 --> 40:07.706
- He told me to hit him.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.441
Schalk told me to hit him.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.942
- [Johannes] We heard that.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.011
- "You won't get me down,
you won't get me down."

40:13.044 --> 40:15.046
- But what we didn't
hear was him asking you

40:15.080 --> 40:16.882
to cut a hole in his throat.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.584
- I saved his life, okay?

40:18.584 --> 40:19.685
He wasn't dead.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.887
- Then what happened,
Mr. Niemand?

40:21.887 --> 40:24.222
- I accidentally hit him
in the throat, so I did

40:24.222 --> 40:26.625
an emergency tracheotomy.
- An emergency tracheotomy?

40:26.625 --> 40:28.794
- Dr. McDreamy, where'd
you learn that shit?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.697
- Scouts, okay?

40:31.730 --> 40:33.231
I saved his life.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.900
- And then you took
him to hospital,

40:34.900 --> 40:37.969
except there's no Schalk
Bosch in any hospital.

40:37.969 --> 40:41.239
See, we followed up
on this, Mr. Niemand.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.474
Where's Schalk?

40:42.474 --> 40:43.441
- [Xander] He's dead,
isn't he, Daniel?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.644
- [Johannes] Where's his body?

40:45.711 --> 40:46.545
- I can't say.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.551
(Johannes sighs)

40:52.551 --> 40:55.053
- How long have you been
working for Frank Redelinghuys?

40:59.124 --> 41:01.259
- Two years, three months.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.994
- You must've seen
plenty in that time.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.162
- Plenty.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.897
- I work in Excel a lot.

41:05.931 --> 41:08.266
I didn't see anything.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.568
- Mm-hm.

41:09.568 --> 41:12.003
Mr. Niemand, I think
this is what happened:

41:12.003 --> 41:14.806
You didn't mean to kill
Schalk Bosch, I understand.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.908
But this guy fucked your wife.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.778
I know I would've
lost my temper,

41:19.778 --> 41:22.247
but when things started
cooling off, you had a problem.

41:22.247 --> 41:25.751
- An emergency trache, tricheo--

41:25.784 --> 41:27.285
- Tracheotomy.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.154
- Tri, trichemy.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.155
Yeah, all right.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.694
There must've been lots of
blood, and then the body,

41:35.761 --> 41:39.264
not things that tend
to clean themselves.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.299
- And, Louw, who
would you have called

41:41.332 --> 41:42.968
to help you get rid of the body?

41:42.968 --> 41:43.769
- Hmm.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.171
It's hard to say, Captain.

41:46.171 --> 41:50.208
I don't really hang out with
people like that, but, mm,

41:51.610 --> 41:53.945
but if Frank Redelinghuys
was my boss--

41:53.979 --> 41:56.715
- Mm-hm, Louw, I
think you're right.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.650
That's what I would've
done, Mr. Niemand.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.651
- It's not what happened.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.719
- Then what happened?!

42:00.719 --> 42:01.519
- Speak!
- What happened?!

42:01.519 --> 42:02.621
- I can't tell you.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.722
They'll kill me, okay?

42:03.722 --> 42:04.890
- Who will kill you?

42:04.890 --> 42:06.391
- I can't tell you.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.660
(knocking)
- What?!

42:08.694 --> 42:09.695
- [Policeman] Captain?

42:12.063 --> 42:14.399
(Johannes grunts)

42:14.399 --> 42:16.635
- [Xander] Come on, move it.

42:16.668 --> 42:18.469
- [Johannes] You're joking.

42:18.469 --> 42:20.238
- I don't have sense of humor.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.675
There isn't a single print or
pube anywhere in the house.

42:23.709 --> 42:24.910
(Johannes groans)

42:24.910 --> 42:27.312
Nothing Schalk Bosch
can be identified by.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.881
- So it's been
professionally cleaned.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.016
Again.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.217
- Yeah, absolutely.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.219
I would say if it
wasn't for the video,

42:34.252 --> 42:37.255
there would've been, like, no
way to say who or what did it.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.058
I'm sorry, Hannes.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.392
- [Johannes] No, it's okay.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.839
- Surely, you don't
think that miserable

42:53.839 --> 42:54.940
son of a bitch did it.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.209
He can't go to prison,

42:58.209 --> 43:00.946
they'll hand him around like
a package of Jelly Tots.

43:00.946 --> 43:03.381
- No, this is Frank
and Hansie's work.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.416
- And you know his
testimony isn't enough

43:05.416 --> 43:06.685
for a conviction, right?

43:06.685 --> 43:08.253
If he goes to court, even.

43:08.253 --> 43:10.689
- Frank's legal team
will eat him alive.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.557
- That's if Frank lets
him into the court

43:12.590 --> 43:14.626
in anything other
than a body bag.

43:14.626 --> 43:15.460
- [Johannes] Mm.

43:16.928 --> 43:17.763
Right.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.201
- And now?

43:23.201 --> 43:25.603
- Frank's strong point has
always been our weak point.

43:25.603 --> 43:29.574
The slippery bastard
is unpredictable,
except for one thing:

43:31.743 --> 43:35.947
His informants have a tendency
to disappear, or worse.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.949
- So what do you suggest?

43:37.949 --> 43:39.885
- Well, for now, we
have his witness.

43:39.918 --> 43:42.587
I suggest we put
him somewhere safe,

43:42.620 --> 43:46.124
and in the meantime, we're
gonna keep an eye on Frank.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.893
When Frank catches
up with this guy

43:47.926 --> 43:49.494
and does his thing, we got him.

43:50.829 --> 43:53.064
- Surely, you mean
before he does his thing.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.634
You want this poor idiot killed?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.810
- Life gives each of
us a handful of cards.

44:06.244 --> 44:10.481
How we play, well, that's
up to us, but play we must.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.483
- My cards are shit.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.953
- Yeah, they are.

44:14.986 --> 44:18.356
But what if I could
deal you a new hand, hm?

44:19.490 --> 44:20.291
Hm?

44:21.459 --> 44:22.961
Do you know anything
about WITSEC?

44:22.994 --> 44:24.095
- Witness Protection.

44:25.363 --> 44:26.765
- We could hide you away.

44:26.798 --> 44:28.934
Give you a new
identity, a new life.

44:30.035 --> 44:31.536
- I'm in.

44:31.602 --> 44:32.771
- Give me something I can use,

44:32.804 --> 44:34.672
and we'll send you
off to your new life.

44:35.807 --> 44:39.177
And Frank Redelinghuys
to his new one.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.345
Jail.

44:40.345 --> 44:41.479
- Sounds good.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.681
- Our program's one of the best.

44:43.681 --> 44:46.184
And Lieutenant Kruger
is the best of the best.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.887
- If Lieutenant Kruger hides
you, no one will find you.

44:50.355 --> 44:52.523
- I don't know if you
heard, but I said I'm in.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.226
Let's go?

44:55.226 --> 44:56.061
Please?

44:57.195 --> 44:58.129
- Tea or coffee?

44:59.197 --> 45:00.065
- Just some water.

45:02.567 --> 45:04.402
And then I was back at work

45:04.402 --> 45:06.404
and everything was
back to normal.

45:08.639 --> 45:09.507
And that's it.

45:12.677 --> 45:15.747
- Everything will work out,
Mr. Niemand, you'll see.

45:15.747 --> 45:16.915
(knocking)
Yes?

45:18.750 --> 45:20.385
- Lieutenant Kruger's here.

45:20.385 --> 45:21.686
- [Johannes] Okay, thanks.

45:23.154 --> 45:25.690
(gentle music)

45:30.395 --> 45:32.397
Lieutenant Kruger,
I'm glad you made it.

45:33.231 --> 45:34.732
- Louw said it's urgent.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.234
- Extremely.

45:36.267 --> 45:38.103
The man in there is Frank
Redelinghuys's accountant.

45:38.103 --> 45:39.905
He refuses to testify in court,

45:39.905 --> 45:41.940
but we have a recording of it.

45:42.007 --> 45:44.375
And I suspect, as soon
as Frank finds out,

45:44.409 --> 45:45.743
the shit hits the fan.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.712
There's enough to send
him to prison for life.

45:47.712 --> 45:49.380
- So he has to disappear?

45:49.414 --> 45:51.416
- [Johannes]
Exactly, right away.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.751
According to him, Frank's
already threatened his life.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.253
Plus, witness protection...

45:56.587 --> 45:58.523
- [Erica Voiceover]
Look for the devil,

45:58.556 --> 46:00.358
and you will find him.

46:00.358 --> 46:03.428
Too many pedophiles, they
all start looking the same.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.529
Shame.

46:04.562 --> 46:05.730
- [Johannes] So, when...

46:08.099 --> 46:10.768
- [Erica Voiceover]
Shame for both of us.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.203
- I'm Lieutenant Kruger.

46:12.237 --> 46:15.240
If you want to live, do
exactly as I say, understood?

46:15.240 --> 46:16.541
- Yep.

46:16.541 --> 46:18.409
- Anything else from your side?

46:18.443 --> 46:20.245
- Are you leaving already?

46:20.245 --> 46:21.913
- This is what will happen next:

46:21.947 --> 46:24.482
When I walk out the door,
you will wait 10 minutes,

46:24.482 --> 46:27.152
then you move to the lowest
level of the parking area.

46:27.218 --> 46:28.253
Wait for me there.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.126
- Am I going with her?

46:36.394 --> 46:37.562
- [Johannes] Daniel,
for the record,

46:37.595 --> 46:39.264
can you please
use his full name?

46:40.932 --> 46:43.168
- [Daniel] Frank Redelinghuys.

46:43.168 --> 46:46.237
Frank Redelinghuys shot
Schalk Bosch in the head.

46:46.271 --> 46:47.772
- See, I've watched
you and Acker

46:47.805 --> 46:49.640
dance with each other for
years now, it's beautiful.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.478
He catches you, and you
slip through his fingers.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.313
- [Frank] Blood is slippery.

46:55.313 --> 46:56.581
- So I've heard.

46:56.614 --> 46:58.116
My point is, Frank,
I don't like losing.

46:59.417 --> 47:01.152
I'm fed up with it.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.621
- You want to play
for the other team?

47:03.654 --> 47:06.858
- I wouldn't put it quite
like that, but yeah.

47:06.858 --> 47:09.861
- By giving me the recording?

47:11.262 --> 47:13.932
- [Xander] Uh-huh, by
giving you something better.

47:13.965 --> 47:16.267
(cellphone beeps)

47:16.267 --> 47:17.335
- [Frank] What's that?

47:18.970 --> 47:20.638
- [Xander] This
is Daniel Niemand.

47:24.976 --> 47:26.978
- [Frank] That little dot?

47:27.012 --> 47:28.679
- He's at your police station.

47:28.679 --> 47:29.981
- At the moment, yeah.

47:31.449 --> 47:33.885
But in a few minutes, even
I won't know his location.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.621
- Are you taking me
for a fool, Inspector?

47:36.654 --> 47:39.457
- Maybe, but this GPS is
the only way to find out.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.294
I suggest you do it
before the battery dies.

47:44.229 --> 47:47.398
I'd say you have
about six hours.

47:51.302 --> 47:52.137
Hmm?

47:54.072 --> 47:56.074
Bon appetit, gentlemen.

47:56.141 --> 47:58.076
I heard the moussaka
is fantastic.

48:01.179 --> 48:03.014
- [Frank] Okay, wait!

48:03.048 --> 48:03.881
- [Hansie] Frank.

48:04.815 --> 48:06.151
- [Frank] What do you want?

48:07.585 --> 48:11.056
- Okay, cellphone, wallet,
any other personal items?

48:14.725 --> 48:18.096
Keep your arms stretched out.
(device beeps)

48:18.096 --> 48:19.030
(device beeps)

48:19.064 --> 48:21.766
(device beeping)

48:33.411 --> 48:36.214
Last chance, get into the
car, and your new life begins.

48:42.387 --> 48:43.721
Lie low and hide your face.

48:48.726 --> 48:51.362
(tires screeching)

48:51.362 --> 48:54.365
(cellphone beeping)

48:59.937 --> 49:02.773
(computer beeping)

49:10.081 --> 49:12.250
- [Xander] Captain,
yeah, he took the bait.

49:14.552 --> 49:16.154
- [Erica Voiceover] To
reach the middle of nowhere,

49:16.154 --> 49:17.488
you have to drive very far.

49:20.258 --> 49:22.760
Past all the
somewheres out there.

49:25.796 --> 49:26.931
But I like nowhere.

49:28.599 --> 49:33.604
(car seat whirring)
(button clicking)

49:57.462 --> 49:58.296
- Wow.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.165
This is pretty.

50:04.835 --> 50:06.337
So what's next?

50:06.337 --> 50:08.439
- See, there's a house in
the mountains I often use.

50:08.473 --> 50:10.041
No one knows about it except me.

50:11.509 --> 50:14.379
We'll wait there until your
new identity's in the system.

50:14.379 --> 50:15.480
Few weeks max.

50:15.513 --> 50:16.347
- Sounds good.

50:18.449 --> 50:19.450
Will I get a new name?

50:19.484 --> 50:20.318
- [Erica] Yes.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.555
- Okay, can it be
something badass?

50:25.790 --> 50:29.860
Something like Jack
Ace, or Tom Black.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.700
- You'll get a name
from our database.

50:35.733 --> 50:38.469
Something commonplace
from your year of birth,

50:38.503 --> 50:42.073
Jan, Johan, Fourie, Van der
Merwe, something like that.

50:42.073 --> 50:42.873
- Okay.

50:44.509 --> 50:46.977
(Erica sighs)

50:53.251 --> 50:55.820
- Captain, you know we can
cut off their GPS signal.

50:58.489 --> 50:59.990
- Why would we wanna do that?

50:59.990 --> 51:01.992
- I'm just saying, we don't
have to follow through.

51:02.026 --> 51:03.994
I'm sure we can think
of something else.

51:03.994 --> 51:05.363
Lieutenant Kruger's
one of the good ones.

51:05.396 --> 51:06.231
What about her?

51:07.398 --> 51:09.567
- Did you leave your
balls in Cape Town?

51:10.868 --> 51:13.371
How many people have
suffered under Frank?

51:13.371 --> 51:16.507
How many more will get
trampled underneath his feet?

51:16.507 --> 51:19.877
If we don't stop him now, their
blood will be on our hands.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.779
I'd rather dip my
toes in a bit of blood

51:21.779 --> 51:23.848
than drown in a swimming
pool full of it.

51:26.384 --> 51:27.252
- Yeah, think bigger.

51:27.252 --> 51:28.686
- Yes!

51:28.719 --> 51:30.221
The bigger picture.

51:30.221 --> 51:35.059
Besides, I think Kruger
can take care of herself.

51:35.926 --> 51:36.727
She's used to hard-asses.

51:42.267 --> 51:45.136
(woman vocalizing)

51:57.615 --> 51:58.449
- Can I help you?

52:16.066 --> 52:17.134
Oh, this is neat.

52:24.675 --> 52:25.610
(drapes swish)

52:25.643 --> 52:26.744
- [Erica] Keep that closed.

52:28.813 --> 52:29.847
(lock clacking)

52:29.914 --> 52:32.583
(keys jingling)

52:43.027 --> 52:44.529
- So which side do I sleep on?

52:45.996 --> 52:46.964
- [Erica] This one.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.669
- I was just joking.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.638
You'll see as you get
to know me better--

52:53.671 --> 52:54.872
- We're not friends.

52:54.872 --> 52:56.874
I have no desire to
get to know you better,

52:56.874 --> 53:00.110
and even less desire for
you to know me better.

53:00.144 --> 53:02.280
In this suitcase is
your new identity.

53:02.280 --> 53:05.149
As soon as your new life
starts, my job's done.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.951
Until then, stay out of my way.

53:06.951 --> 53:09.053
Get dressed, we're
going for a walk.

53:15.393 --> 53:16.227
- You know what?

53:17.495 --> 53:19.530
I don't have to be here, okay?

53:19.530 --> 53:21.065
I'm doing all of you a favor.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.735
I don't know what
you know about me,

53:24.735 --> 53:26.404
but I've been
through hell, okay?

53:27.638 --> 53:29.974
My counselor bonked my
wife, then I hit him,

53:29.974 --> 53:31.809
then I saved him, then
he got shot in the face

53:31.809 --> 53:34.011
by my boss who's
clearly a psychopath.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.145
- [Erica] Wow, shit life.

53:35.145 --> 53:36.681
- Yes.

53:36.714 --> 53:37.915
Yes, it is.

53:37.915 --> 53:40.485
It's the shitty week of
a really shitty life,

53:40.518 --> 53:42.387
and all this is class A shit.

53:45.723 --> 53:46.724
We don't have to be friends.

53:46.724 --> 53:49.059
I'm used to it, that's fine.

53:49.093 --> 53:51.095
But you don't have to
treat me like a child.

53:52.430 --> 53:54.599
You can go by
yourself, I'm staying.

54:03.508 --> 54:06.076
(gentle music)

54:09.914 --> 54:10.748
- Erica.

54:13.117 --> 54:14.184
My name is Erica.

54:17.187 --> 54:17.955
- Erica?

54:19.223 --> 54:20.057
That's beautiful.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.793
With her, I can go for a walk.

54:36.941 --> 54:39.477
(gun clacking)

55:19.817 --> 55:21.986
- Frank just stopped about
one kilometer from them.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.921
We're still about
five kilometers away.

55:25.923 --> 55:28.292
- He'll probably walk
further, sneak up on them.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.995
- Should we stop and
walk the rest of the way?

55:31.028 --> 55:32.363
You know, sneak up on him?

55:33.931 --> 55:36.601
- Louw, if the corridors at
the station weren't so narrow,

55:36.634 --> 55:38.302
I'd have driven there too.
(Xander chuckles)

55:38.302 --> 55:39.804
I don't walk
anywhere if I don't--

55:39.837 --> 55:44.842
(tire pops)
(tires screech)

55:54.852 --> 55:56.854
Well, it's no use sitting here.

55:56.887 --> 55:58.389
Someone has to change the tire.

55:58.389 --> 55:59.223
- Um.

56:00.858 --> 56:01.859
- "Um" what?

56:01.859 --> 56:03.360
- That was the spare tire.

56:07.498 --> 56:09.333
- [Johannes] Damn it!

56:09.333 --> 56:10.501
Bring the GPS.

56:11.869 --> 56:14.405
(gentle music)

56:18.242 --> 56:19.143
- [Xander] Stupid!

57:44.962 --> 57:47.965
- [Daniel] Now,
that's a waterfall!

57:47.965 --> 57:48.799
- Wanna swim?

57:50.735 --> 57:52.570
- [Daniel] I didn't
bring a swimsuit.

57:53.671 --> 57:54.739
- [Erica] So?

58:30.608 --> 58:31.542
(gun firing)

58:31.542 --> 58:34.044
(regal music)

58:40.551 --> 58:42.987
- [Frank] And where are
you, what's going on?

58:43.020 --> 58:43.854
- I'm here.

58:45.122 --> 58:46.657
I could easily take out Daniel,

58:48.358 --> 58:50.027
but the agent
might be a problem.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.529
- [Frank] You know what to do.

58:52.529 --> 58:53.363
- All right.

59:02.973 --> 59:05.542
(gentle music)

59:20.658 --> 59:23.227
(gun clacking)

59:25.562 --> 59:26.897
- Sometimes, I think this place

59:26.897 --> 59:28.833
is too good for people like you.

59:28.833 --> 59:30.400
- People like who?

59:30.400 --> 59:31.535
- Pedophiles!

59:31.568 --> 59:32.670
- What?

59:32.670 --> 59:33.537
I'm not a...

59:36.040 --> 59:38.375
Hansie, Erica, Hansie!

59:38.375 --> 59:39.944
(Erica groans)
(gun fires)

59:39.944 --> 59:42.613
(Erica screams)

59:42.680 --> 59:43.513
(Hansie grunts)
(Erica grunts)

59:43.513 --> 59:44.348
(Hansie groans)

59:44.348 --> 59:45.850
(Erica grunts)

59:45.883 --> 59:48.552
(both grunting)

59:48.585 --> 59:51.255
(Erica screams)

59:51.255 --> 59:52.757
(Hansie screams)

59:52.757 --> 59:55.592
(Erica screams)
(punch thuds)

59:55.626 --> 59:57.628
(Erica grunts)
(knee thuds)

59:57.628 --> 59:59.797
(elbow thuds)
(Erica groans)

59:59.797 --> 1:00:01.465
(Erica grunting)

1:00:01.465 --> 1:00:02.532
(elbow thuds)
(Hansie groans)

1:00:02.566 --> 1:00:04.902
(Erica groaning)

1:00:04.935 --> 1:00:08.105
(Hansie groaning)

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:10.808
(Erica chomping)

1:00:16.947 --> 1:00:18.716
(Hansie gurgling)

1:00:18.716 --> 1:00:20.084
- [Hansie] Bitch.

1:00:20.985 --> 1:00:23.821
(Hansie gurgling)

1:00:33.130 --> 1:00:38.135
(rock thuds)
(Erica groans)

1:00:40.838 --> 1:00:42.840
- [Erica Voiceover] You
should've just run, Daniel.

1:00:42.907 --> 1:00:45.075
Taken that paunch
of yours, and fled.

1:00:46.643 --> 1:00:47.611
But you're too good.

1:00:49.613 --> 1:00:52.316
You return to the
dog that bit you.

1:00:52.316 --> 1:00:54.819
(gentle music)

1:01:04.194 --> 1:01:05.262
- Fuck it, old man.

1:01:05.295 --> 1:01:06.797
You can't hot wire cars anymore.

1:01:06.797 --> 1:01:09.333
These days, you need
lasers and shit.

1:01:09.333 --> 1:01:10.167
- Shit!

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:18.508
(Daniel grunting)

1:01:38.395 --> 1:01:41.231
(Daniel slurping)

1:01:47.872 --> 1:01:50.540
- When you wake up, we're gonna
have a little chat, woman.

1:01:52.709 --> 1:01:55.212
(Daniel sighs)

1:01:57.081 --> 1:01:58.248
When you wake up...

1:02:03.053 --> 1:02:05.890
(Daniel grunting)

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:16.867
Okay, come.

1:02:18.735 --> 1:02:21.371
The bunny goes through the hole,

1:02:21.371 --> 1:02:23.107
then he comes out the bottom,

1:02:24.041 --> 1:02:26.076
and fetches all of his friends.

1:02:28.779 --> 1:02:29.613
- Come.

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:31.849
Come, time to pee.

1:02:31.849 --> 1:02:32.682
Go on.

1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:39.289
(hand slaps)

1:02:39.356 --> 1:02:42.860
(cellphone beeps)

1:02:42.893 --> 1:02:44.294
Pee pee.
(gun firing)

1:02:44.294 --> 1:02:46.797
(regal music)

1:02:53.904 --> 1:02:55.539
Come on, little
brother, answer it.

1:02:55.539 --> 1:02:57.107
- [Man] Help me, someone help!

1:02:57.107 --> 1:02:57.942
(Frank sighs)

1:02:57.942 --> 1:02:59.276
(gun fires)

1:02:59.309 --> 1:03:00.144
- [Frank] Okay.

1:03:00.144 --> 1:03:01.311
What the fuck?!

1:03:29.473 --> 1:03:30.674
- Louw!

1:03:30.740 --> 1:03:31.842
- Yeah?
- Tracks.

1:03:33.743 --> 1:03:34.912
- [Xander] I'm coming.

1:03:40.584 --> 1:03:41.952
- [Daniel] Mm-hm.

1:03:43.753 --> 1:03:45.655
Okay, okay, okay.

1:03:54.764 --> 1:03:56.700
(SUV whirring)

1:03:56.700 --> 1:03:58.202
- [Johannes] Louw.

1:03:58.202 --> 1:03:59.703
- Are you okay?

1:03:59.769 --> 1:04:00.604
- Wait.

1:04:00.604 --> 1:04:01.705
Can you hear something?

1:04:03.173 --> 1:04:04.208
- No. Why?

1:04:06.843 --> 1:04:08.012
- [Johannes] Nothing.

1:04:08.012 --> 1:04:09.846
I think my heart's
beating inside my head.

1:04:16.186 --> 1:04:18.889
(dramatic music)

1:04:25.695 --> 1:04:26.997
(Erica groans)

1:04:26.997 --> 1:04:27.998
(Erica gasps)

1:04:28.032 --> 1:04:30.134
(Erica grunting)

1:04:30.134 --> 1:04:31.635
- Hey, hey, sit still.

1:04:31.635 --> 1:04:33.037
Hey, sit still.

1:04:33.037 --> 1:04:34.004
Sit still!

1:04:35.339 --> 1:04:36.173
Sit still!

1:04:39.076 --> 1:04:40.477
Why did you try to shoot me?

1:04:40.510 --> 1:04:42.346
- Why did you hit
me on the head?!

1:04:42.346 --> 1:04:44.414
- Because you tried to shoot me!

1:04:44.414 --> 1:04:45.916
- Untie me!
- No!

1:04:45.983 --> 1:04:47.584
I see what you do
with that belt.

1:04:49.019 --> 1:04:51.521
Be glad I left your bra on,
it's probably just as dangerous.

1:04:52.589 --> 1:04:56.160
Sit still!
(Erica grunting)

1:05:00.264 --> 1:05:01.065
- So now what?

1:05:02.766 --> 1:05:04.601
Are you gonna kill me?

1:05:04.668 --> 1:05:05.936
- Maybe. Maybe I will.

1:05:05.936 --> 1:05:08.005
Shut up, I'm trying to think.

1:05:08.038 --> 1:05:09.539
- Look, if I were you,

1:05:09.573 --> 1:05:12.242
I'd get off the road ASAP
before Frank finds me.

1:05:14.744 --> 1:05:15.779
Your cover's blown.

1:05:15.779 --> 1:05:17.547
We need to make a new plan.

1:05:17.581 --> 1:05:18.582
- Fuck!

1:05:18.582 --> 1:05:20.084
Is this my life?!

1:05:20.084 --> 1:05:21.218
- Where are you taking me?

1:05:21.218 --> 1:05:22.619
- I don't know.

1:05:22.619 --> 1:05:23.753
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

1:05:23.753 --> 1:05:24.588
Shut up!

1:05:26.056 --> 1:05:28.225
- I have a place.
- I said shut up!

1:05:28.225 --> 1:05:29.426
Okay?

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:31.595
Now, you listen to
me, and listen well.

1:05:31.595 --> 1:05:32.696
Okay?

1:05:32.729 --> 1:05:35.365
From now on, I'm
in charge, okay?

1:05:35.365 --> 1:05:36.700
I'm in control, I'm in
control, I am in control!

1:05:38.435 --> 1:05:39.469
- [Erica] I can see that.

1:05:39.536 --> 1:05:41.038
- Yes. Yes.

1:05:41.071 --> 1:05:41.905
Yeah.

1:05:41.905 --> 1:05:42.739
Yeah.

1:05:45.442 --> 1:05:46.643
You have a place nearby?

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:50.280
- I have a safe house
in the next town.

1:05:50.314 --> 1:05:51.448
It's not far from here.

1:05:52.782 --> 1:05:55.119
- Okay, but if you try
any of your ninja shit,

1:05:58.322 --> 1:05:59.256
I'll snuff you!

1:05:59.289 --> 1:06:00.824
I'll snuff you, you bitch!

1:06:00.824 --> 1:06:01.658
- Whoa!

1:06:02.592 --> 1:06:03.427
No!

1:06:04.928 --> 1:06:05.762
- Hm.

1:06:05.762 --> 1:06:06.930
But I will.

1:06:07.797 --> 1:06:08.632
I can.

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:11.401
- Whoa!

1:06:11.435 --> 1:06:12.436
(man yelps)

1:06:12.469 --> 1:06:14.438
Whoa, whoa, guys!

1:06:14.438 --> 1:06:15.639
Guys!

1:06:15.639 --> 1:06:16.473
What, no!

1:06:17.574 --> 1:06:18.675
No, guys, hold it.

1:06:18.675 --> 1:06:19.909
Just wait.

1:06:19.943 --> 1:06:21.111
We're all gentlemen.

1:06:21.145 --> 1:06:22.612
Look, we can, like,
sort this out--

1:06:22.612 --> 1:06:23.813
- Just drop him, cuz.

1:06:23.813 --> 1:06:24.981
- [Goon] Where's
the fucking money?

1:06:25.015 --> 1:06:26.183
- [Man] What money
are you talking about?

1:06:26.250 --> 1:06:28.852
Bro, listen, I got,
like, six kids at home.

1:06:28.852 --> 1:06:30.687
Six, kids!

1:06:30.754 --> 1:06:32.322
That's a fuck ton of kids!

1:06:35.025 --> 1:06:36.526
- [Xander] What the
fuck happened here?

1:06:40.597 --> 1:06:41.765
- Anything?

1:06:41.798 --> 1:06:43.033
- [Xander] Just this.

1:06:43.033 --> 1:06:44.034
- Fuck!

1:06:44.034 --> 1:06:45.001
(gun firing)
(gun fires)

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:45.835
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.

1:06:45.869 --> 1:06:46.703
- Sorry, Captain, I--

1:06:46.703 --> 1:06:49.206
(regal music)

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:53.677
It's Frank.

1:06:57.881 --> 1:06:59.316
- Hello, Frank.
- No!

1:06:59.349 --> 1:07:01.351
- [Johannes] It's your
favorite detective speaking.

1:07:01.351 --> 1:07:02.686
- Where is Hansie?

1:07:02.686 --> 1:07:04.321
- Well, depends
on your religion.

1:07:05.455 --> 1:07:06.790
- You're gonna
shit bricks, Acker.

1:07:06.823 --> 1:07:08.692
I swear, I'll pull
the trigger myself.

1:07:09.693 --> 1:07:10.994
- Why so aggressive?

1:07:10.994 --> 1:07:12.962
I was about to do you a favor.

1:07:15.065 --> 1:07:15.899
- I'm listening.

1:07:17.501 --> 1:07:18.968
- His body's here,
deep in the mountains.

1:07:18.968 --> 1:07:20.970
It's quite a mission
to find the place.

1:07:21.004 --> 1:07:23.473
In exchange for his body, how
about we help one another?

1:07:23.473 --> 1:07:24.874
- What are you suggesting?

1:07:25.975 --> 1:07:27.311
- Meet me tomorrow.

1:07:27.344 --> 1:07:28.845
8:00 a.m.

1:07:28.878 --> 1:07:31.548
My partner will send you one
of those pin dropper things.

1:07:32.716 --> 1:07:37.721
See you, Frank.

1:07:39.423 --> 1:07:40.590
- [Goon] Boss?

1:07:42.226 --> 1:07:45.028
- Hansie is dead,
we must fetch him.

1:08:02.045 --> 1:08:04.581
(lively music)

1:08:15.525 --> 1:08:18.061
(gentle music)

1:08:23.367 --> 1:08:24.701
- [Daniel] So now what?

1:08:24.734 --> 1:08:26.636
- Okay, here's what
you're gonna do:

1:08:26.636 --> 1:08:28.605
You'll untie me and
give me those keys.

1:08:29.773 --> 1:08:31.275
There are clean
clothes in my bag.

1:08:31.308 --> 1:08:34.311
There's food in the kitchen,
and then we'll discuss...

1:08:38.815 --> 1:08:39.649
Daniel?

1:08:41.718 --> 1:08:42.752
Hey.

1:08:42.786 --> 1:08:43.587
Daniel.

1:08:50.126 --> 1:08:53.397
Daniel!

1:08:53.430 --> 1:08:54.264
Daniel!

1:08:55.965 --> 1:08:58.502
(Erica groans)

1:08:59.903 --> 1:09:00.670
Daniel!

1:09:06.610 --> 1:09:09.145
(gentle music)

1:09:13.183 --> 1:09:15.785
- [Erica Voiceover] I wasn't
necessarily honest with Daniel.

1:09:19.789 --> 1:09:21.458
This isn't a safe house.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:25.662
This had been my parents' place.

1:09:27.030 --> 1:09:29.299
Murdered by the first
of all those bodies

1:09:29.333 --> 1:09:31.301
now lying at the
bottom of that pool.

1:09:36.039 --> 1:09:38.174
I guess that's something
we have in common.

1:09:41.211 --> 1:09:44.314
Life has dealt us both
a sad set of cards.

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:53.357
(Xander grunting)

1:10:03.032 --> 1:10:04.701
- Where are Daniel and Erica?

1:10:05.869 --> 1:10:06.703
- Hang on.

1:10:09.138 --> 1:10:10.640
About 15 kilometers from here.

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:11.808
Why, should we pick 'em up?

1:10:11.808 --> 1:10:13.843
- No, Daniel's
served his purpose.

1:10:13.877 --> 1:10:15.211
We have everything we need.

1:10:15.211 --> 1:10:16.713
Daniel can have his new life.

1:10:18.515 --> 1:10:23.520
- [Xander] Whew.

1:10:28.892 --> 1:10:31.495
(gentle music)

1:10:42.872 --> 1:10:44.207
- [Erica] Daniel!

1:10:58.121 --> 1:10:59.022
- What the?

1:11:01.625 --> 1:11:02.692
What?

1:11:02.726 --> 1:11:03.893
What the hell?

1:11:07.731 --> 1:11:09.433
- [Erica] Daniel!

1:11:09.433 --> 1:11:11.801
(Daniel groans)

1:11:11.868 --> 1:11:12.736
Let me out!

1:11:16.039 --> 1:11:17.607
- Fuck it, Louw.

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:20.477
You bought jerky, you don't
have to eat your fingers.

1:11:20.544 --> 1:11:22.712
- I know why they call it
wrap, if the filling falls out,

1:11:22.712 --> 1:11:24.080
but fuck, it was nice.

1:11:27.283 --> 1:11:28.084
Mm.

1:11:32.221 --> 1:11:33.823
- [Daniel] Come.

1:11:33.823 --> 1:11:35.325
Come on.

1:11:35.392 --> 1:11:38.294
- Can you please untie me so I
can eat like a normal person?

1:11:38.294 --> 1:11:40.063
- You're not a normal person.

1:11:40.096 --> 1:11:42.131
You'll stab me in the
eye with this fork.

1:11:42.131 --> 1:11:43.066
- I have to pee.

1:11:44.233 --> 1:11:46.102
- So why do you wanna kill me?

1:11:46.135 --> 1:11:48.805
- I'm doing society a
favor, you filthy bastard.

1:11:48.805 --> 1:11:49.606
- Really?

1:11:50.507 --> 1:11:51.441
Okay.

1:11:51.475 --> 1:11:52.942
Okay.

1:11:52.942 --> 1:11:54.844
Let's see what I've
done to society.

1:11:54.844 --> 1:11:56.480
- I have to pee.

1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:58.482
- Look at this lovely
photo of Daniel Niemand.

1:11:58.515 --> 1:12:01.618
Hey, sexual harassment.

1:12:01.651 --> 1:12:03.252
Wowie, huh?

1:12:03.252 --> 1:12:05.088
Assault, feeling
up a four-year-old.

1:12:06.322 --> 1:12:07.290
A lad.

1:12:09.693 --> 1:12:11.361
That sounds exactly like me.

1:12:11.361 --> 1:12:12.862
Hey--
- I said I have to pee!

1:12:14.097 --> 1:12:15.599
Are you kidding me?

1:12:15.632 --> 1:12:17.367
- Then piss yourself,
I don't care.

1:12:18.802 --> 1:12:20.670
Who is this lady I beat up?

1:12:20.670 --> 1:12:21.938
I really gave her a go.

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:25.341
(urine splashing)

1:12:25.375 --> 1:12:26.342
What are you doing?

1:12:27.877 --> 1:12:29.112
What are you doing?

1:12:29.145 --> 1:12:30.013
- I told you I had to
go to the bathroom!

1:12:30.013 --> 1:12:31.280
- No, stop it! Hold it.

1:12:31.314 --> 1:12:32.281
Hey, stop, Erica.

1:12:32.281 --> 1:12:33.349
That's gross!

1:12:34.183 --> 1:12:35.985
The chair's made of oak.

1:12:36.019 --> 1:12:36.953
No!

1:12:36.953 --> 1:12:38.121
Do you have paper towels?

1:12:39.322 --> 1:12:40.557
You're cleaning
that up yourself.

1:12:52.402 --> 1:12:54.170
- Daniel, I'm tired.

1:12:54.203 --> 1:12:55.338
I'm dirty.

1:12:55.338 --> 1:12:57.240
I wanna take a bath.

1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:58.241
Please untie me.

1:13:05.849 --> 1:13:06.683
Come on.

1:13:11.187 --> 1:13:12.522
My legs are covered in pee.

1:13:16.993 --> 1:13:19.729
(Erica grunting)

1:13:26.603 --> 1:13:28.438
- What are you doing?!

1:13:29.606 --> 1:13:31.107
Why do you wanna keep
trying to kill me?!

1:13:31.107 --> 1:13:34.077
- Because bastards like
you get away with murder!

1:13:34.077 --> 1:13:35.712
The system's
screwed, that's why!

1:13:38.682 --> 1:13:41.017
The world's better off
without people like you!

1:13:43.887 --> 1:13:46.122
- Okay, okay, look at this!

1:13:46.122 --> 1:13:47.223
Look!

1:13:47.256 --> 1:13:48.625
- I've read your file, thanks.

1:13:48.625 --> 1:13:50.059
- No, look!
- I know what you look like!

1:13:50.093 --> 1:13:51.127
- [Daniel] No, read!

1:13:54.397 --> 1:13:55.599
- Clive Jenkins?

1:13:55.599 --> 1:13:57.100
- I've never been
Clive Jenkins, okay?

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:59.769
This isn't my file,
I've never had a file!

1:13:59.803 --> 1:14:00.970
I've smoked one joint!

1:14:01.037 --> 1:14:02.238
By accident.

1:14:02.271 --> 1:14:03.773
And three traffic
fines, maximum!

1:14:03.773 --> 1:14:04.808
I'm hella boring!

1:14:06.142 --> 1:14:07.944
The system is
screwed, you're right.

1:14:12.482 --> 1:14:13.550
- What are you doing?

1:14:13.583 --> 1:14:16.152
(gentle music)

1:14:18.454 --> 1:14:20.724
- Go ahead and kill me,
I don't care anymore.

1:14:31.067 --> 1:14:33.336
- [Erica Voiceover] The
best part of being a child

1:14:33.336 --> 1:14:35.338
is that the world
constantly changes.

1:14:36.573 --> 1:14:38.174
So when you come
to the realization

1:14:38.174 --> 1:14:41.344
that you're wrong
about something, at
least it doesn't hurt.

1:14:48.918 --> 1:14:50.186
(Xander sniffing)

1:14:50.186 --> 1:14:52.188
- Ugh, I think that
beef jerky is off.

1:14:53.122 --> 1:14:54.791
- No, it's Hansie.

1:14:54.791 --> 1:14:55.625
- Oh.

1:15:05.635 --> 1:15:07.270
- [Erica] This is my room.

1:15:07.270 --> 1:15:09.038
- The other rooms
didn't have bedding.

1:15:14.277 --> 1:15:16.846
(gentle music)

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:26.355
- How?

1:15:34.564 --> 1:15:36.566
Why didn't you leave
me at the waterfall?

1:15:39.202 --> 1:15:40.336
- It didn't feel right.

1:15:43.039 --> 1:15:46.375
(Erica sighs)

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:47.577
- Daniel, I'm sorry.

1:15:49.478 --> 1:15:50.313
- It's fine.

1:16:07.063 --> 1:16:09.733
- You would've been number five.

1:16:32.789 --> 1:16:34.457
Where did you learn
to tie a knot?

1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:37.627
- [Daniel] Scouts.

1:16:39.262 --> 1:16:40.764
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

1:16:41.698 --> 1:16:42.465
What the hell?

1:16:45.101 --> 1:16:47.103
Okay, no.
- This is how I sleep.

1:16:48.037 --> 1:16:48.905
Yeah.

1:16:48.938 --> 1:16:50.239
Yeah.

1:16:50.239 --> 1:16:53.076
(Daniel mumbling)

1:16:54.878 --> 1:16:57.413
(gentle music)

1:17:16.632 --> 1:17:18.802
(loud clattering)

1:17:18.802 --> 1:17:21.671
(suspicious music)

1:17:25.174 --> 1:17:26.009
Erica?

1:17:44.493 --> 1:17:46.595
(footsteps rustling)

1:17:46.629 --> 1:17:47.797
- Who are you beating up?

1:17:47.831 --> 1:17:49.332
- [Daniel] No one,
I thought you,

1:17:49.332 --> 1:17:50.934
that you wouldn't have woken up.

1:17:52.969 --> 1:17:53.837
- Sit. Eat.

1:17:56.372 --> 1:17:57.206
Hurry up.

1:18:00.877 --> 1:18:03.046
- [Daniel] Do you think
Frank's on our trail?

1:18:04.613 --> 1:18:05.782
- I have a house in Namibia.

1:18:05.815 --> 1:18:07.817
Think it's best if we go there.

1:18:07.817 --> 1:18:10.319
Cross the border, wait
for the dust to settle.

1:18:10.319 --> 1:18:11.888
They'll eventually give up.

1:18:11.888 --> 1:18:14.057
- How many places do you have?

1:18:14.123 --> 1:18:14.958
- Enough.

1:18:16.125 --> 1:18:17.326
(Daniel blows)

1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:18.161
Eat.

1:18:19.395 --> 1:18:20.396
- It's a bit hot.

1:18:23.132 --> 1:18:25.701
(Daniel blows)

1:18:42.485 --> 1:18:44.587
- [Johannes] Louw, pop the boot.

1:18:44.587 --> 1:18:45.588
- [Xander] What now?

1:18:47.056 --> 1:18:49.392
- I think Frank wants a
picture of his brother.

1:18:51.194 --> 1:18:54.030
(Xander groaning)

1:18:56.265 --> 1:18:57.400
- [Xander] Fuck.

1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:00.236
(cellphone chimes)

1:19:02.238 --> 1:19:07.176
(hand thuds)
(goon groans)

1:19:07.176 --> 1:19:09.879
(dramatic music)

1:19:26.262 --> 1:19:28.798
(gentle music)

1:19:37.807 --> 1:19:40.376
(Daniel sighs)

1:19:41.878 --> 1:19:43.046
- Daniel.
(ring jingles)

1:19:43.079 --> 1:19:44.713
- Shit, shit, shit.

1:19:44.713 --> 1:19:45.548
Shit!

1:19:47.283 --> 1:19:48.117
Fuck!

1:19:50.486 --> 1:19:51.320
Coming.

1:19:56.159 --> 1:19:58.761
(Daniel sighs)

1:20:01.965 --> 1:20:02.798
Namibia?

1:20:05.001 --> 1:20:05.935
- [Erica] Yep.

1:20:05.969 --> 1:20:07.136
- [Daniel] Mm.

1:20:19.115 --> 1:20:21.084
- You don't know where to go.

1:20:21.084 --> 1:20:22.085
- Namibia.

1:20:22.118 --> 1:20:23.152
It's north.

1:20:23.152 --> 1:20:23.987
Hop in.

1:20:33.429 --> 1:20:36.265
- [Xander] Hansie was
a few shits behind.

1:20:36.299 --> 1:20:37.166
- [Johannes] Okay, that's fine.

1:20:37.166 --> 1:20:38.601
They're almost here.

1:20:38.634 --> 1:20:39.468
- [Xander] Where?

1:20:40.669 --> 1:20:41.938
- [Johannes] Go
and hide up there,

1:20:41.971 --> 1:20:43.439
and don't shoot
until they shoot.

1:20:46.842 --> 1:20:49.445
(gun clacking)

1:20:49.478 --> 1:20:52.448
(suspenseful music)

1:21:05.061 --> 1:21:07.830
(dramatic music)

1:21:15.538 --> 1:21:17.473
- That photo showed shit style.

1:21:17.473 --> 1:21:18.975
It's my brother, you fuck!

1:21:20.476 --> 1:21:22.311
- Sorry, bud, that's
how I found him.

1:21:24.847 --> 1:21:27.416
(gun clacking)

1:21:31.854 --> 1:21:36.859
- So, last night, I thought
you'd wanna apologize

1:21:38.227 --> 1:21:40.729
for trying to kill me, and
maybe reward me with your body.

1:21:40.729 --> 1:21:43.232
- It's okay.
- It was stupid of me.

1:21:43.232 --> 1:21:44.533
The thing is, the old Daniel

1:21:44.533 --> 1:21:46.502
never would've done
something like that.

1:21:46.502 --> 1:21:48.504
- Daniel--
- Yeah, no, he wouldn't have.

1:21:48.537 --> 1:21:51.240
But I thought that
this new Daniel--

1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:52.741
- [Erica] Daniel, look!

1:21:52.775 --> 1:21:54.043
(Daniel yelps)

1:21:54.077 --> 1:21:56.545
(tense music)

1:22:01.050 --> 1:22:06.055
(jeep clacks)
(guns firing)

1:22:07.456 --> 1:22:09.225
- [Frank] Get Hansie!

1:22:11.094 --> 1:22:13.429
- [Goon] Come on, help Rona.

1:22:34.450 --> 1:22:35.618
- Louw!

1:22:35.618 --> 1:22:37.286
- Captain!
- Come!

1:22:37.286 --> 1:22:38.621
- [Xander] Okay!

1:22:42.258 --> 1:22:43.159
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1:22:43.159 --> 1:22:44.327
- Shit!
- Now what?

1:22:44.327 --> 1:22:46.162
- Just drive, drive!
- I'm driving!

1:22:46.162 --> 1:22:48.831
- What's Acker doing here?
- I don't know.

1:22:48.831 --> 1:22:49.965
- Drive.
- I'm driving.

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:51.400
- Drive!
- I'm driving!

1:22:51.434 --> 1:22:54.237
(thrilling music)

1:22:58.507 --> 1:22:59.308
- Turn left.

1:23:05.914 --> 1:23:06.749
What the hell?

1:23:06.749 --> 1:23:07.783
I said turn left.

1:23:09.818 --> 1:23:10.819
Daniel, are you mad?

1:23:10.819 --> 1:23:12.155
It's a wedding!

1:23:12.155 --> 1:23:14.923
- [Daniel] If you can't
run, you gotta hide.

1:23:14.957 --> 1:23:17.160
What, you've never been bullied?

1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:18.827
- It's a shit idea, Daniel.

1:23:18.861 --> 1:23:20.363
- [Daniel] You're a shit idea.

1:23:26.802 --> 1:23:28.671
- Mm, well, what do you know?

1:23:28.671 --> 1:23:31.207
(gentle music)

1:23:41.317 --> 1:23:43.018
- Whoa, whose was this?

1:23:44.453 --> 1:23:47.290
- Number one's.
(gun clacks)

1:23:50.859 --> 1:23:53.162
(people chattering)

1:23:53.196 --> 1:23:56.565
I know we're at church, but
you're not fully protected.

1:23:56.565 --> 1:23:57.400
(gun clacking)

1:23:57.400 --> 1:23:58.567
This is a shit idea.

1:24:00.369 --> 1:24:01.404
So what's your plan?

1:24:02.705 --> 1:24:04.840
- Okay, I thought
you're my girlfriend.

1:24:04.873 --> 1:24:05.808
Okay? Karlien.

1:24:05.808 --> 1:24:07.476
No, no, no, no, wait, Natasha.

1:24:07.476 --> 1:24:08.644
Yeah.

1:24:08.644 --> 1:24:10.045
And I'm the groom's cousin.

1:24:11.214 --> 1:24:12.047
- Daniel.

1:24:13.349 --> 1:24:14.183
- [Daniel] Fuck.

1:24:16.085 --> 1:24:18.321
- I don't know if I should
give you a hug or a whooping.

1:24:18.354 --> 1:24:20.889
I knew you were innocent,
but your phone is off.

1:24:20.889 --> 1:24:23.259
I left you 200 voicemails.

1:24:23.326 --> 1:24:24.527
- Hello, Mom.

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:26.729
- Magriet took you
off the guest list.

1:24:26.729 --> 1:24:27.896
We all thought you
weren't coming,

1:24:27.930 --> 1:24:29.532
now you're here
with a bloody date?

1:24:30.666 --> 1:24:32.000
- Hey there, Daniel.
- Hello, sir.

1:24:52.288 --> 1:24:53.589
Hello, Grandpa!

1:24:55.758 --> 1:24:57.092
Dan, Daniel!

1:24:59.262 --> 1:25:00.363
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

1:25:00.363 --> 1:25:01.096
Come.

1:25:15.644 --> 1:25:18.314
(guns clacking)

1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:38.234
- [Xander] Shit!

1:25:41.103 --> 1:25:43.772
(guns clacking)

1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:45.774
- Mom.

1:25:49.678 --> 1:25:51.847
- Oh, my child, doesn't
your mother feed you?

1:25:51.914 --> 1:25:52.748
Mwah.

1:25:52.748 --> 1:25:53.849
- Hello, Granny.

1:25:53.849 --> 1:25:55.851
No, Granny, I left home.

1:25:55.918 --> 1:25:58.787
Granny, this is my
girlfriend, Natasha.

1:25:58.821 --> 1:25:59.988
- Hello, Pauline.

1:25:59.988 --> 1:26:00.956
You look lovely.

1:26:02.090 --> 1:26:02.991
Mm!
- It's not Pauline.

1:26:02.991 --> 1:26:04.927
- People, take your places.

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:05.861
The bride's coming.

1:26:07.596 --> 1:26:08.431
- Thank you.

1:26:19.675 --> 1:26:21.544
- Apart from your granny's
spit all over my face,

1:26:21.544 --> 1:26:22.645
this isn't a bad idea.

1:26:26.782 --> 1:26:28.050
- What are you doing here?

1:26:35.658 --> 1:26:36.492
Leave.

1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:38.361
This is my family.

1:26:39.528 --> 1:26:40.563
No, Grandpa.

1:26:41.730 --> 1:26:42.565
Grandpa, no.

1:26:44.032 --> 1:26:44.867
No.

1:26:53.542 --> 1:26:56.479
(silencers squeaking)

1:26:56.479 --> 1:26:57.646
Don't. Not here.

1:26:58.881 --> 1:27:00.583
What are you doing,
we're in church.

1:27:04.052 --> 1:27:06.154
I told you...

1:27:06.188 --> 1:27:09.558
(gun fires)
(crowd applauding)

1:27:09.558 --> 1:27:10.826
(hand slaps)

1:27:10.859 --> 1:27:11.694
That's my niece.

1:27:12.728 --> 1:27:13.562
- [Frank] Sorry.

1:27:16.699 --> 1:27:18.701
- [Reverend] Will
everyone please stand?

1:27:20.769 --> 1:27:25.774
* Hallelujah

1:27:26.575 --> 1:27:31.580
* Hallelujah

1:27:34.750 --> 1:27:37.085

1:27:48.263 --> 1:27:53.035
(gun fires)
(Grandpa groans)

1:27:53.035 --> 1:27:54.970
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:27:54.970 --> 1:27:56.104
- Sorry.

1:27:56.104 --> 1:27:58.474
- That's my grandpa.

1:27:58.541 --> 1:28:01.877
* Hallelujah, hallelujah

1:28:03.211 --> 1:28:04.447
- Everyone, out.

1:28:04.447 --> 1:28:08.751
(choir singing in
foreign language)

1:28:25.801 --> 1:28:28.236
* Hallelujah

1:28:29.805 --> 1:28:31.106
(choir singing in
foreign language)

1:28:31.106 --> 1:28:33.308
- You may be seated.

1:28:33.308 --> 1:28:35.911
- [Erica Voiceover] If you
do what I do long enough,

1:28:35.944 --> 1:28:37.946
and have seen
everything I've seen,

1:28:39.448 --> 1:28:42.785
you get a hunch when you've
reached the end of the road.

1:28:50.693 --> 1:28:52.027
- Shit style, Frank.

1:28:52.094 --> 1:28:54.262
That was his grandpa, you fuck.

1:28:54.296 --> 1:28:56.965
- Yes, you took me for a fool.

1:28:56.965 --> 1:28:58.300
- [Johannes] Mm.

1:29:00.102 --> 1:29:01.537
- You used Daniel as bait?

1:29:01.537 --> 1:29:02.771
- What?

1:29:02.805 --> 1:29:04.473
What, why, what?

1:29:05.641 --> 1:29:07.643
You substandard policemen, okay?

1:29:08.877 --> 1:29:13.048
And you, you're a substandard
boss, so fuck you.

1:29:14.349 --> 1:29:16.051
- Eh, I'm crying.

1:29:18.521 --> 1:29:20.122
This little shit is mine.

1:29:22.057 --> 1:29:23.992
You're going to
pay for my brother.

1:29:26.695 --> 1:29:28.130
- I should be the one paying.

1:29:34.637 --> 1:29:36.472
- Okay, new plan.

1:29:36.505 --> 1:29:38.173
You get Erica, we get Daniel.

1:29:40.876 --> 1:29:41.877
- Shit plan.

1:29:43.211 --> 1:29:44.046
- Okay.

1:29:44.046 --> 1:29:45.313
Fuck everything.

1:29:45.313 --> 1:29:48.083
(gun fires)
(goon groans)

1:29:48.083 --> 1:29:51.153
(knife rasps)
(goon screaming)

1:29:51.186 --> 1:29:53.889
- Love is patient and kind.

1:29:53.889 --> 1:29:56.759
(choir singing in
foreign language)

1:29:56.825 --> 1:29:57.660
(goon groans)
(elbow thuds)

1:29:57.660 --> 1:29:58.894
(both grunting)

1:29:58.894 --> 1:30:01.229
(gun fires)
Love does not envy or boast.

1:30:01.263 --> 1:30:03.432
(gun fires)

1:30:03.432 --> 1:30:07.369
It is not arrogant.
(gun firing)

1:30:07.402 --> 1:30:08.437
It is not rude.

1:30:08.437 --> 1:30:10.873
* Hallelujah

1:30:14.743 --> 1:30:16.879
- It's not irritable.

1:30:16.879 --> 1:30:19.214
(guns firing)
(both grunting)

1:30:19.214 --> 1:30:21.717
It does not keep a
record of wrongs.

1:30:21.750 --> 1:30:24.252
(guns firing)

1:30:26.388 --> 1:30:28.223
(goon groans)

1:30:28.223 --> 1:30:30.258
Love bears all things,

1:30:32.761 --> 1:30:34.429
believes all things,

1:30:36.431 --> 1:30:38.033
hopes all things.

1:30:38.033 --> 1:30:42.304
(Erica groaning)
It endures all things.

1:30:42.304 --> 1:30:45.974
(knee thuds)
(Erica groans)

1:30:45.974 --> 1:30:47.476
Love is eternal.

1:30:47.543 --> 1:30:49.812
(Erica grunting)
(goon groaning)

1:30:49.812 --> 1:30:51.113

(gun fires)

1:30:57.285 --> 1:30:58.554
(gun fires)

1:30:58.587 --> 1:31:01.223
(Erica groaning)

1:31:09.297 --> 1:31:11.800
(guns firing)

1:31:24.647 --> 1:31:27.082
(gun clicks)

1:31:28.183 --> 1:31:30.519
- Say hi to my
brother, you fuck.

1:31:30.519 --> 1:31:35.524
(guns firing)
(both groaning)

1:31:39.194 --> 1:31:40.829
- At fucking last.

1:31:48.103 --> 1:31:50.472
(gun firing)

1:31:55.678 --> 1:31:56.979
- You may now kiss.

1:31:59.948 --> 1:32:01.383
(crowd cheering)
- Woo, Daniel!

1:32:01.383 --> 1:32:03.051
- [Woman] Woo!

1:32:03.051 --> 1:32:06.622
- [Erica Voiceover] Upstairs,
they have a happy ending.

1:32:06.655 --> 1:32:09.057
But down here, it's
a different story.

1:32:11.994 --> 1:32:13.061
- [Daniel] Erica, hey.

1:32:13.962 --> 1:32:14.863
Hey.

1:32:14.863 --> 1:32:16.131
(Erica groaning)
Erica?

1:32:18.366 --> 1:32:21.036
(women gasping)

1:32:22.370 --> 1:32:24.039
- [Man] Someone
phone an ambulance.

1:32:24.039 --> 1:32:25.073
- [Erica] Go.

1:32:34.750 --> 1:32:37.085
- Daniel Ignatius Niemand!

1:32:38.220 --> 1:32:39.722
- [Erica] Go.

1:32:39.722 --> 1:32:42.925
- I'm not Daniel Niemand!

1:32:47.763 --> 1:32:48.997
I'm a different person.

1:33:00.042 --> 1:33:02.510
(somber music)

1:33:27.903 --> 1:33:30.438
(gentle music)

1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:39.748
- [Erica Voiceover]
As the saying goes,

1:33:39.782 --> 1:33:41.416
no one gets out of life alive.

1:33:43.118 --> 1:33:44.119
I'm proud of mine.

1:33:45.453 --> 1:33:47.289
I wouldn't change a damn thing.

1:33:48.791 --> 1:33:50.258
Except maybe for Daniel.

1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:57.099
If we only had a bit
more time, who knows?

1:33:58.967 --> 1:34:00.903
As I leave this world,

1:34:00.936 --> 1:34:03.105
I think of Daniel on
his way to Namibia.

1:34:04.807 --> 1:34:06.641
Has he really changed,

1:34:06.675 --> 1:34:09.444
or has there always been
somebody behind the nobody?

1:34:11.146 --> 1:34:12.247
If only we...

1:34:13.181 --> 1:34:14.016
Wait.

1:34:15.984 --> 1:34:17.319
He doesn't have a passport.

1:34:19.187 --> 1:34:20.022
He'll be okay.

1:34:23.992 --> 1:34:26.461
Everything will be okay.

1:34:27.429 --> 1:34:30.598
(inspirational music)

1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:28.023
(gentle music)

1:37:03.952 --> 1:37:07.022
(gentle piano music)

1:37:36.384 --> 1:37:38.286
* Oh

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:40.155
* Oh

1:37:40.155 --> 1:37:42.124
* Oh

1:37:42.124 --> 1:37:43.992
* Oh

1:37:44.026 --> 1:37:45.827
* Oh

1:37:45.827 --> 1:37:47.662
* Oh

1:37:47.695 --> 1:37:49.631
* Oh

1:37:49.631 --> 1:37:51.399
* Oh

1:37:51.399 --> 1:37:53.301
* Oh

1:37:53.335 --> 1:37:55.237
* Oh

1:37:55.237 --> 1:37:57.005
* Oh

1:37:57.039 --> 1:37:59.041
* Oh
