00:28.404 --> 00:30.822
Have you ever been trapped?

00:30.823 --> 00:33.283
Lost in your own body?

00:33.284 --> 00:36.036
Lost in your own mind?

00:36.037 --> 00:37.955
Lost in time?

00:37.956 --> 00:39.374
So desperate to escape.

00:40.375 --> 00:43.503
To just... get out.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.445
Help!!!

01:10.446 --> 01:14.283
Mom!!! Help!!!

01:14.284 --> 01:16.868
Dad!! Dad!!

01:16.869 --> 01:18.162
Mom!!!

01:18.246 --> 01:20.039
Help!!!

01:25.837 --> 01:27.714
My name is Susannah Cahalan.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.675
I'm 21 years old and here
I am at my dream job

01:30.717 --> 01:32.844
at the New York Post.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.345
Living in New York...

01:34.387 --> 01:36.639
I don't know, we all have dreams, right?

01:36.681 --> 01:37.724
And don't laugh at me,

01:37.765 --> 01:40.643
but to work at the Post was mine.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.079
Hey Richard, can you check this out for me?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.980
No.
No time for babysitting now, Susannah.

01:44.022 --> 01:45.189
Go annoy Margo.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.691
Go.
Go, go.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.902
I had my whole life in front of me.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.778
I was fearless.

01:51.779 --> 01:56.367
And I had absolutely no idea
what was waiting for me.

01:56.409 --> 01:57.784
Hey.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.537
Is that my pen in your mouth?

02:00.288 --> 02:02.040
Uh-uh.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.082
Maybe.

02:03.416 --> 02:05.418
You keep that now, and email me next time.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.586
Save a tree.

02:06.628 --> 02:08.880
I don't know what's wrong with it,
it just feels...

02:08.920 --> 02:10.048
it feels off, you know?

02:10.089 --> 02:11.150
No, this is good, Susannah,

02:11.174 --> 02:13.926
but you just need to
move the last paragraph to the first.

02:13.968 --> 02:17.847
And for the love of God
please find a new headline.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.724
"Rear and Present Danger"?

02:20.350 --> 02:22.435
"Illegal Russian butt implants."

02:22.477 --> 02:23.853
I mean, really?

02:23.895 --> 02:25.331
Let me tell you, you're better than this.

02:25.355 --> 02:26.773
I'm just paying my dues, you know?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.901
Slowly but surely I'm making my way
to the front page.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.028
I mean, look.
At least it's a real story.

02:32.070 --> 02:33.088
Real people actually died from this

02:33.112 --> 02:35.657
and I think I can maybe
get someone prosecuted.

02:35.698 --> 02:36.699
I wanna help people.

02:36.741 --> 02:37.992
You are so bright-eyed.

02:38.034 --> 02:40.328
I need major sunglasses right now.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.125
Oh, is that him?

02:46.167 --> 02:48.586
Oh my god.
I'm gonna kill you.

02:48.628 --> 02:49.712
Look at your smile.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.714
- Stop!
- It's so big!

02:51.756 --> 02:54.841
Is it your man?
Is it your new hot, sexy man?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.886
Margo... you need to calm down.

02:56.928 --> 02:58.930
It's getting pretty serious, huh?

02:58.971 --> 03:00.139
We'll see.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.557
- Who knows?
- Who knows?

03:01.599 --> 03:03.319
I don't have time to talk to you right now.

03:07.230 --> 03:10.066
Excuse me, pretty lady?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.110
- Hey.
- Hey!

03:12.151 --> 03:14.487
- Oh my god, I'm so sorry I'm so late.
- It's ok.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.198
You look cute.
Are you nervous?

03:17.240 --> 03:20.493
Thanks, um, no.
Yeah.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.078
I mean, yeah, a little bit.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.789
You shouldn't be.
I like- I like this.

03:24.831 --> 03:26.582
This is- yeah.
This is me dressing up.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.304
You look like a Smurf.
Like a tanned Smurf.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.754
Thank you.
That's really nice of you to say.

03:31.765 --> 03:32.773
- I'm kidding.
- That's me.

03:32.797 --> 03:36.174
I love it.
Alright, you ready?

03:36.175 --> 03:37.759
- Come on.
- Ok.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.220
Let's do it.

03:39.470 --> 03:42.640
So, Stephen,
what is it that you do for a living?

03:42.682 --> 03:45.184
Uh, I play music, Mr. Cahalan.

03:45.226 --> 03:48.563
Yeah? What genre?

03:48.604 --> 03:51.023
Um, well, it's a bit like...

03:51.065 --> 03:53.443
you know, The Smiths sorta meets Tom Waits.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.069
That's what I'm going for at least.

03:55.111 --> 03:57.321
You do that all day, every day?

03:57.405 --> 03:58.614
Mmmhmm.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.384
Yeah, I mean, I work in a record store, too,

04:00.408 --> 04:01.576
when I can get the hours.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.453
Which is actually where I met Susannah.

04:03.494 --> 04:04.638
I like it, you know, it's fun.

04:04.662 --> 04:05.747
It's good pocket money.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.123
Pocket money?

04:07.165 --> 04:08.165
Yeah.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.169
Susannah said that you were in banking,
is that right?

04:11.210 --> 04:13.004
Yeah, I was, but um...

04:13.045 --> 04:14.839
I'm having a career change at the moment.

04:14.881 --> 04:16.841
We're looking at new options.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.009
Aren't we, Giselle?

04:18.050 --> 04:19.635
It's a new start.

04:19.677 --> 04:20.762
Hello?

04:20.803 --> 04:22.638
Hey mom, we're on the roof!

04:22.680 --> 04:25.558
I am so sorry that we are late again.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.910
- It's ok.
- Happy birthday, baby.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.060
Hi, mom.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.479
Oh, my beauty.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.920
Love you.

04:30.921 --> 04:31.922
Hi.

04:31.923 --> 04:34.133
Heard you got engaged, congratulations.

04:34.150 --> 04:35.860
Thank you.

04:35.902 --> 04:36.944
It's exciting.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.571
- Yeah.
- Wow.

04:38.613 --> 04:40.448
Well, this isn't awkward.

04:40.490 --> 04:41.657
How about some alcohol?

04:41.699 --> 04:43.326
- Anyone?
- Good idea.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.286
- Have a seat.
- Let's get this party started.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.454
Tom, congratulations.

04:46.496 --> 04:49.332
Happy birthday to you,

04:49.373 --> 04:55.379
Happy birthday dear Susannah,

04:55.463 --> 04:59.342
Happy birthday to you.

05:13.815 --> 05:15.525
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.651
Make a wish.

05:16.692 --> 05:17.819
Uh...

05:22.865 --> 05:24.700
- Want some help?
- Yeah.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.619
Ready? One, two, three.

05:28.830 --> 05:29.831
Alright.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.751
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

05:33.793 --> 05:36.838
- Ok.
- Love you guys.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.004
Shall I slice it?

05:38.005 --> 05:40.174
- Do you want me to cut it up?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:40.216 --> 05:41.968
- Here.
- Can you pass me the plates?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.010
Yes, of course.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.387
Great.

05:47.890 --> 05:51.060
It looks really yummy.

05:51.102 --> 05:53.020
Ok.

05:53.062 --> 05:56.357
Birthday girl first.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.650
Thank you.

05:57.651 --> 05:58.652
Alright, Stephen.

05:58.653 --> 06:00.196
You're totally gonna kill it.

06:02.238 --> 06:03.781
Really?

06:03.823 --> 06:04.907
Hey, what's taking so long?

06:05.867 --> 06:07.033
Ok. Yeah, I know.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.451
- Stephen, come on.
- Yeah.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.996
Alright, alright.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.458
Steps to the right,

06:17.086 --> 06:19.589
Take them all night,

06:22.508 --> 06:25.261
You don't bother me,

06:27.930 --> 06:35.062
You don't have to leave...

06:35.271 --> 06:36.856
So you didn't like it?

06:36.898 --> 06:38.232
I didn't say that.

06:38.274 --> 06:43.069
I said that it was interesting
and I thought it was cool.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.155
Oh my god.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.699
Stephen!

07:03.883 --> 07:04.967
Morning.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.969
Good morning.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.221
That's quite the look.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.891
Want some coffee?

07:11.933 --> 07:14.185
Uh... oh, no.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.311
I am late.

07:15.353 --> 07:17.104
Very late.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.156
Gross.

07:27.198 --> 07:28.950
- Gross.
- What?

07:28.991 --> 07:30.427
Why are you smiling
this early in the morning?

07:30.451 --> 07:31.619
Oh, come on.

07:31.661 --> 07:33.221
Nu-uh, nobody smiles
this early in New York City,

07:33.245 --> 07:34.705
it's unnatural and disgusting.

07:34.747 --> 07:36.122
Why you got a problem with it, Margo?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.208
You look ridiculous.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.501
Maybe I'm happy.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.752
I know what it is.

07:39.794 --> 07:42.129
It's that budget version of Joey Ramone.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.506
Susannah!

07:43.547 --> 07:46.008
See? He didn't smile this morning.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.133
But you're not hearing me.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.135
Come- come in here.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.262
Yeah, no, I don't give a dirty,
smelly shit, ok?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.429
Let me be clear to you.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.639
If it's true, we print it

07:52.640 --> 07:54.350
and he has to suffer the consequences.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.495
No. Next time he'll know
to keep his dick in his pants

07:56.519 --> 08:00.523
and stop handing out
underwear like it's welfare.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.525
- Gumball?
- I'm good. Thank you.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.985
Alright, so you're gonna interview

08:04.026 --> 08:06.320
that creepy senator next week.

08:06.362 --> 08:09.281
I don't hear a question
mark in your question.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.993
That's because I don't do question
marks, Susannah, you know that.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.286
- Right.
- Anyway, he's remorseful, he says he's sorry

08:14.328 --> 08:16.664
he wants to go on the record,
apologize to his wife

08:16.706 --> 08:18.725
and I think this
will be the big one that we need this month

08:18.749 --> 08:21.210
and you, you're gonna bring it home for me...

08:26.465 --> 08:28.300
Let me just think about this for a second.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.302
Really?

08:30.344 --> 08:31.446
I didn't ask you to come
here to think about doing it,

08:31.470 --> 08:32.722
you're doing it.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.847
Are you not ready for this?

08:34.849 --> 08:36.474
Margo said you're ready for
an assignment like this

08:36.475 --> 08:39.020
and I know you're not
a cub reporter anymore, so...

08:39.854 --> 08:41.355
Hey. Hey.
Back here.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.816
- Mmmhmm.
- Back here.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.483
All I want you to do is fill the paper,
get this online.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.653
- You got it?
- Got it.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.488
Ok, good.
What do you have for me?

08:50.489 --> 08:52.323
Oh, status online with social media.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.659
Yeah, sounds awful.
Our readers will love it.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.244
18 inches in the Friday edition.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.495
You'll have it Thursday night.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.123
I know I will 'cause I can always
count on you, Susannah Cahalan.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.625
Now get the hell out of my office.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.342
I know what you did.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.887
- What's that now?
- I know exactly what you did.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.139
- Thank you.
- You deserve it.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.476
- I just have a loud mouth.
- Mmmhmm.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.650
Do I need a sneeze guard?

09:27.818 --> 09:29.403
I'm good, I'm good.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.947
Anyway, what are you on right now?

09:32.364 --> 09:36.243
I'm on the bedbug outbreak
and it is so disturbing.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.370
- Yuck.
- What are you on?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.998
Um, status on the internet.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.209
Look at us with these hard-hitting stories.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.627
Yeah, they're intense, huh?

09:44.710 --> 09:47.546
Edward R. Murrow is
just turning in his grave.

11:02.580 --> 11:03.706
What're you doing?!

11:03.747 --> 11:05.541
Wake up!

11:19.722 --> 11:21.599
Hey Susannah, where are you?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.851
I haven't seen you for a few days,

11:23.893 --> 11:26.187
just checking in to see if you're ok.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.886
Hey, Margo?

11:59.637 --> 12:03.181
What do you know about
the look of a bed bug bite?

12:03.182 --> 12:05.016
Do you think that you have them?

12:05.017 --> 12:06.309
Because they're everywhere.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.894
They're haunting my dreams.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.938
Look.

12:09.230 --> 12:10.939
Does that look like one to you?

12:10.940 --> 12:13.942
I don't know what I'm looking for. No,
I don't see anything. You're fine.

12:13.943 --> 12:16.028
You- you don't see that?

12:17.279 --> 12:19.030
- I see nothing.
- Ok, hold on.

12:19.031 --> 12:22.909
Look, ok? Just look. Closely.
Do you not see that?

12:22.910 --> 12:26.079
I do not see that. I don't. I don't
know what you're talking about.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.665
Margo, it's right there!

12:27.831 --> 12:29.415
I see you need a tan.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.084
Come on, you don't- you can't see?

12:31.085 --> 12:32.586
Susannah!

12:33.712 --> 12:35.297
What is this shit?

12:36.465 --> 12:37.799
You got names that are misspelled,

12:37.800 --> 12:40.051
not even a Nexus search to fact check,

12:40.052 --> 12:41.094
what the hell are you thinking?

12:41.095 --> 12:43.055
Legal would have a fit!

12:43.305 --> 12:45.014
You said that it would be done by Thursday

12:45.015 --> 12:46.558
and it's Monday!

12:52.773 --> 12:55.734
It's Monday.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.612
Richard. Richard, I'm...

12:58.654 --> 13:00.114
I'm sorry.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.991
Ok? I haven't been myself lately,

13:02.032 --> 13:03.117
I've been really unwell,

13:03.158 --> 13:07.204
I haven't... I haven't been sleeping, I-

13:07.246 --> 13:08.789
Go to your desk and re-write it, ok?

13:08.831 --> 13:10.416
Watch your spelling.
Watch your grammar.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.685
I want it by tonight, Susannah,

13:11.709 --> 13:13.627
because this shit is unreadable.

13:13.669 --> 13:16.462
Even if you weren't feeling well I didn't
think you could do something this bad.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.903
Now go to your desk and get it done.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.466
Get out of here. Go.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.721
And she's still here.
Susannah, I said leave.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.521
Hey!

13:35.607 --> 13:37.735
Get your ass out of my office.

13:49.204 --> 13:54.251
I didn't think you could
do something this bad...

13:54.418 --> 13:55.586
Are you ok?

14:36.418 --> 14:38.170
Susannah, where are you?

14:38.587 --> 14:40.546
You're very, very late.
You gotta get your ass in here,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.131
you're gonna miss the 10:00 meeting.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.675
Hello?

14:55.813 --> 14:57.939
Susannah, I'm really pissed right now.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.273
You're gonna miss the 10:00 meeting

14:59.274 --> 15:00.775
and I don't wanna be doing this, ok?

15:00.776 --> 15:01.859
I'm not your mother.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.945
Get your shit together and come to your job!

15:03.946 --> 15:05.780
I'm not making a call like this to you again.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.574
- Goodbye.
- Are you serious?

15:09.076 --> 15:11.137
You know your career as
a journalist is in the toilet

15:11.161 --> 15:13.330
when you start pitching
stories about your mother.

15:13.372 --> 15:14.540
Come on, man!

15:15.541 --> 15:16.582
Alright.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.978
Susannah, thank you so much for joining us,
I'm glad you could make it.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.754
Who's got something?
Anybody? Anything else?

15:20.796 --> 15:22.798
Those panties, from the senator,

15:22.840 --> 15:24.299
they're still really hot right now.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.636
We're gonna find out all that information
because Susannah is on that one, right?

15:27.678 --> 15:28.846
Susannah, you got it?

15:28.887 --> 15:31.598
The interview with the senator this week,
are you ready?

15:31.640 --> 15:32.683
Mmmhmm.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.352
Yeah. Totally. Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah.

15:35.394 --> 15:36.812
- All you. You're good.
- Yes, sir.

15:36.854 --> 15:38.689
Ok. We're counting on you.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.733
Alright, let's switch topics
and see what we got.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.193
Who's got something juicy, guys?

15:44.194 --> 15:45.486
Give me something hot and exciting.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.737
Who's got something?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.823
There's always the mystery of
the missing manhole covers.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.242
Missing manhole covers?

15:50.325 --> 15:52.369
Ok, we can figure that out.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.294
I feel really sick, you know?

16:01.295 --> 16:05.840
My head hurts,
my stomach hurts and my hand is numb

16:05.841 --> 16:08.050
and my leg is numb and I just...

16:08.051 --> 16:10.261
I don't- I don't feel well, Stephen.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.097
I don't feel well.
I don't...

16:12.598 --> 16:13.806
Are you even listening to me right now?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.391
Are you on- are you on your guitar?

16:15.392 --> 16:18.019
- No.
- Oh, god.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.230
Yeah, I'm- I'm recording something right now.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.523
So is it like pins and needles?

16:22.524 --> 16:25.985
I don't know, ok? I don't know,
I just- it feels... it feels weird.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.947
I don't- I've never felt like this before.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.365
Never.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.658
Are you just hung over from last night?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.995
I don't know.
I didn't even really drink.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.750
You're not pregnant, are you?

16:40.751 --> 16:42.836
Ok, you're unhelpful.
Bye.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.639
Hey.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.767
What the hell are you doing under your desk?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.559
You know, Stephen.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.728
Just...

17:00.854 --> 17:02.647
You wanna talk about it?

17:02.648 --> 17:04.733
Do you want me to come
under the desk with you?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.484
Yeah.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.823
I'm just gonna go get a coffee, ok?

17:12.824 --> 17:13.907
You want anything?

17:13.909 --> 17:16.868
I just wanna sit under my desk
and take some personal calls.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.705
It's all the rage with the fussy blondes.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.670
Ok, Susannah, what's going on?

17:25.253 --> 17:27.297
Um, I don't know.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.549
I mean, I guess you could say

17:28.590 --> 17:31.468
I've had these flu-like symptoms.

17:31.510 --> 17:35.472
Um, I've had a lot of numbness
in my left arm and leg.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.182
I feel like my head is
really fuzzy all the time.

17:38.183 --> 17:42.854
I don't know if it correlates to
any of this but I have these...

17:43.522 --> 17:47.733
These bed bug bites on my arm here...

17:47.734 --> 17:49.319
Let me look.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.321
Do you see them?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.325
Uh, any history of Lyme disease?

17:55.701 --> 17:56.701
No.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.704
Ok, sure.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.540
Ok, look at my nose.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.458
Can you hold your arms out,
straight in front of you,

18:04.459 --> 18:05.752
palms up please?

18:05.794 --> 18:08.005
Ok, and push against my hands.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.093
Ok, good. You can put your
coat back on and have a seat.

18:14.011 --> 18:17.598
I'd like to draw some blood
and do a routine work-up

18:17.681 --> 18:19.683
and I'd like you to get an MRI.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.668
An MRI?

18:21.686 --> 18:23.769
Um, everything looks normal
but I'd just like to be safe.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.148
There's a place down the street
that can do one right now.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.467
That's it, you're all done.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.443
What? What?!

19:53.485 --> 19:55.278
Why won't you stop?!

19:56.863 --> 19:58.323
Do it again!

19:59.157 --> 20:00.409
Say it!

20:04.705 --> 20:06.164
Didn't think so.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.098
Hi, Susannah.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.890
I do want to let you know
we got some good news,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.227
the MRI came back normal and we've eliminated

20:27.269 --> 20:29.895
the possibility that you had a stroke
or a blood clot,

20:29.896 --> 20:32.190
two things that, frankly,
I was worried about.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.694
But the results are all clear,
that's what matters.

20:38.739 --> 20:39.990
Thank you.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.214
Oh, uh...

20:56.256 --> 20:57.799
- Hey, It's me.
- Hey.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.761
- Um...
- Are you gonna let me in?

21:02.721 --> 21:06.766
Yeah, um... I'm really tired.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.809
Uh, I think we should just
do another day, ok?

21:08.810 --> 21:10.895
It's fine.
I can just- I can figure it out.

21:10.896 --> 21:13.105
Susannah,
I just drove all the way across the city.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.858
Now is good for me.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.239
It's really dirty.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.199
I need to clean up.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.743
I wasn't expecting...

21:30.957 --> 21:33.585
What the hell is that smell, Susannah?

21:34.878 --> 21:36.754
Dad, I said it's really dirty.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.924
This place is a mess.

21:40.383 --> 21:44.137
Susannah, what have you been doing in here?

21:44.179 --> 21:46.014
That's Stephen's, it's not me.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.432
I don't really drink.

21:48.683 --> 21:51.101
You have got to get yourself together.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.561
You can't live like this.

21:52.562 --> 21:53.897
You're an adult now.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.024
You're not in college anymore.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.068
Look, in between work and everything

21:59.069 --> 22:01.154
I barely have time, dad.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.948
Ok, let me take a look at this leak

22:03.949 --> 22:06.868
and then we'll clean it up together.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.830
Is it here or here?

22:09.871 --> 22:11.748
It's on top, dad.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.083
Where a normal drip comes from.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.584
It's fine under here, it's all dry.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.503
There's nothing going on here.

22:16.545 --> 22:18.129
Let me see.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.631
There's a drip.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.426
It just happened, dad.

22:25.011 --> 22:28.598
- You didn't see that?
- Susannah, there is no drip.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.768
There's a drip.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.563
Is work going ok?

22:35.564 --> 22:37.107
Yeah, it's good.

22:37.691 --> 22:38.732
Hey, listen.

22:38.733 --> 22:41.736
Don't let the place get like this again.
It's nice for me to know you live in

22:41.737 --> 22:44.030
some kind of cleanliness and comfort here.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.742
So, this... Stephen.

22:48.285 --> 22:49.995
You really like him, huh?

22:51.121 --> 22:52.247
Yeah.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.331
Yeah, I mean,
he's a- he's a good guy and I think...

22:54.332 --> 22:57.878
I think you'll really like him
once you get to know him.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.296
- Yeah?
- Mmmhmm.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.798
Sure he's not just some place-holder?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.634
'Cause a lot of guys,
they don't like to stick around.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.761
Like you did.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.764
Ok, I'm gonna go.

23:09.806 --> 23:10.891
Ok, goodnight.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.057
I love you, drive safe, ok?

23:12.058 --> 23:15.061
- Buy some trash bags.
- I will.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.438
Love you.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.034
Ok.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.343
Susannah, he's ready.

23:46.635 --> 23:47.968
What? Who?

23:47.969 --> 23:49.512
The senator.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.223
Oh.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.391
Oh god.

23:54.392 --> 23:55.601
Uh, oh my god.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.728
Ok.

23:56.811 --> 24:00.649
Ok, uh... I'm not ready for this.

24:00.982 --> 24:04.027
Just take a deep breath, you have this.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.862
Good luck.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.328
- What's up?
- Good meeting you.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.412
Uh-huh.

24:23.838 --> 24:26.174
Um... Ok, what are you- um...

24:26.216 --> 24:27.926
what do you have to say of your actions

24:27.968 --> 24:30.762
and what do you have to say
to the good people of um...

24:30.804 --> 24:32.222
New Jersey?

24:32.263 --> 24:36.851
Obviously I'm...
I'm deeply regretful for what has happened.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.520
I've let myself down, my family down and...

24:39.521 --> 24:41.439
And let your pants down.

24:43.233 --> 24:47.277
Um... sorry, uh... keep-
keep going with what you-

24:47.278 --> 24:48.362
with what you were saying.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.698
- Um-
- Sorry.

24:49.699 --> 24:52.825
As I was saying,
the people of New Jersey who elected me

24:52.826 --> 24:53.868
are fine people and...

24:57.956 --> 25:00.541
I'm sorry,
it sounded just like you said "erected".

25:00.542 --> 25:04.044
I mean, you gotta admit,
it sounded pretty much like that.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.755
Are you alright, young lady?

25:08.008 --> 25:10.051
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.429
No, um- um, I'm sorry.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.848
I have- I have more questions to ask-

25:14.889 --> 25:16.766
No, I'm sorry.
This interview is over.

25:16.808 --> 25:17.851
No. No, no!

25:17.892 --> 25:20.413
I can't believe Richard let this happen.
Did Richard put you up to this?

25:20.437 --> 25:22.188
No.
No, we should finish this!

25:22.230 --> 25:23.815
- This is totally a joke.
- Sit down!

25:23.857 --> 25:25.459
I'm not done with the interview!
I'm not done with it!

25:25.483 --> 25:29.654
You're not- no, ok, fine.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.490
- Jesus.
- Oh my god.

25:34.576 --> 25:38.288
- No, I'm good.
- Ok.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.766
Let me make this clear to you.
The publicists that represent that senator,

25:40.790 --> 25:42.000
it's not just about him.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.186
They represent celebrities
and athletes and everybody else.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.212
And with all of those people,
people that we might want to talk to,

25:47.213 --> 25:50.216
we can't even get them on the phone
because of what you did here!

25:50.258 --> 25:51.485
That is gonna be a problem for me!

25:51.509 --> 25:53.344
That is gonna be a problem for my boss

25:53.386 --> 25:55.055
and that is a problem for this paper!

25:55.096 --> 25:56.389
You should be fired!

25:56.431 --> 25:59.476
You. Should.
Be. Fired.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.480
Get out of here.

26:04.481 --> 26:05.940
Get out, now!

26:59.911 --> 27:01.495
I honestly don't know.

27:01.496 --> 27:05.541
I... know that she's been
acting strange for sure,

27:05.542 --> 27:07.001
for like a week.

27:07.377 --> 27:10.087
Is she uh... drinking a lot?

27:10.088 --> 27:11.672
She looks hung over.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.590
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, I don't think so

27:13.591 --> 27:16.177
but I don't know what
she does with her boyfriend.

27:16.845 --> 27:20.765
- Is she on drugs?
- No. Really?

27:20.766 --> 27:22.057
I don't know. I'm asking.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.769
- I don't think so.
- You sure?

27:24.770 --> 27:26.020
Yeah.

27:26.563 --> 27:28.021
I'm definitely sure she's not on drugs.

27:28.022 --> 27:31.234
I don't think she's acting normal
but I don't think she's on drugs.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.403
Just let me keep my eye on her.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.114
Just for a little while.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.053
Alright, but I'm gonna tell you this.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.576
You keep me informed,
because if this keeps up

27:40.577 --> 27:42.119
she's gonna have to start working from home.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.788
I don't know what's going on with her.
I'm serious.

27:44.789 --> 27:46.123
Yeah, I understand.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.250
I understand.

27:47.417 --> 27:48.418
Ok.

29:31.688 --> 29:36.400
Susannah? Susannah?

29:36.401 --> 29:39.028
Susannah, stop talking in your sleep.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.364
Susannah!

29:42.073 --> 29:43.574
Stop.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.369
Susannah!

29:50.540 --> 29:51.665
Susannah?

29:51.666 --> 29:55.670
Susannah!

30:16.941 --> 30:18.401
Stephen.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.904
- What?
- You gotta get me out of here.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.948
- You gotta.
- What?

30:24.949 --> 30:26.867
You gotta get me out of here.
I can't be here anymore.

30:26.868 --> 30:27.868
No, Susannah.

30:27.869 --> 30:28.994
Come on.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.747
Susannah, we can't leave
until someone looks at you.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.958
Stephen, I don't give a shit.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.377
Well, you should.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.720
If you're not gonna help me

30:46.721 --> 30:48.389
I don't know why you're even here.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.603
Did they give any kind of explanation?

30:54.604 --> 30:57.064
No, they just said that she had a seizure.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.649
Why didn't you call us?

30:59.442 --> 31:00.442
Why didn't you call me?

31:00.443 --> 31:01.902
I- I didn't have your number.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.070
The whole thing happened really fast-

31:03.071 --> 31:04.196
You didn't have our numbers?

31:04.197 --> 31:06.239
Did you not think to look in
her phone under mom and dad?

31:06.240 --> 31:09.284
I mean, what kind of idiot doesn't know how
to look at a cell phone under mom and dad?

31:09.285 --> 31:11.411
I don't know,
I- I just panicked and I grabbed mine

31:11.412 --> 31:13.205
and I had to get her an ambulance.

31:13.206 --> 31:14.956
- I had to get her-
- What kind of doctor saw her?

31:14.957 --> 31:16.166
Um, uh, a nurse.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.542
It was a nurse, I think.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.544
You think it was a nurse?

31:19.545 --> 31:21.046
Uh, I don't- I don't know.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.839
The whole thing- I just-

31:22.840 --> 31:25.467
they just said that she had a seizure and uh,

31:25.468 --> 31:27.678
- and that was all-
- What is wrong with you?

31:27.970 --> 31:29.388
- Well-
- Do you care about her or not?

31:29.389 --> 31:31.099
- What were you doing at the hospital?
- Yes! Of course I do-

31:31.100 --> 31:32.391
Thomas!

31:32.392 --> 31:34.310
Ok, ok, ok.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.020
You know what?

31:36.646 --> 31:39.357
Thank you for taking care of her.

31:40.441 --> 31:41.609
Come on.

31:43.486 --> 31:47.740
Susannah,
I think it's best that you come home with us.

31:49.200 --> 31:53.036
I'm sorry,
that's really sweet of you, but no thank you.

31:53.037 --> 31:55.205
Susannah, I think it's a good idea.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.416
Oh, really, Stephen?

31:57.417 --> 31:59.126
When the going gets tough, huh?

31:59.127 --> 32:00.837
- Susannah, it's not like that.
- No problem.

32:00.838 --> 32:02.963
You know what, I think you should go.
It's really hard for you.

32:02.964 --> 32:06.216
Stephen, why don't-
why don't you go home and just get some rest.

32:06.217 --> 32:08.136
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- That's a good idea.

32:08.137 --> 32:09.679
I'm gonna gather some of your things.

32:09.846 --> 32:12.825
No, you're not gonna be gathering anything,
ok, because this is my home, alright?

32:12.849 --> 32:14.892
And I call the shots when I'm inside here.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.352
I'm not leaving.

32:16.394 --> 32:18.354
- Hey.
- I'm not going anywhere.

32:18.396 --> 32:19.604
Stephen.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.874
Gather some of your things
and you're coming home-

32:20.898 --> 32:25.485
If anything like that ever happens again,
you call me, ok?

32:25.486 --> 32:26.821
Of course.

32:31.576 --> 32:32.869
Where's your toothbrush?

32:33.536 --> 32:35.203
In the bathroom, mom.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.206
Where all the toothbrushes live.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.334
I love you.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.636
Hey, Susannah!

32:50.678 --> 32:52.680
Come talk to me!

33:02.523 --> 33:04.358
Susannah, come on down.

33:09.113 --> 33:10.406
Hey, honey?

33:48.778 --> 33:50.071
What're you doing?

33:52.532 --> 33:54.033
I'm swimming, mom.

33:54.742 --> 33:56.285
I'm just swimming.

34:00.373 --> 34:01.541
Come on in.

34:04.252 --> 34:05.627
Swim to me.

34:05.628 --> 34:08.129
She's not herself.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.214
I mean, I didn't recognize her.

34:09.215 --> 34:13.467
I'm looking in her eyes, she's looking at me,

34:13.469 --> 34:16.847
and I can tell that she's not there.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.016
It's like she's in a trance...

34:29.985 --> 34:31.279
Hey.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.406
Susannah.

34:34.407 --> 34:35.574
I think so.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.788
Oh no.

34:42.290 --> 34:45.041
I just think you really need to,
you know, get some good sleep.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.502
Maybe we gotta think about a trip.

34:47.503 --> 34:50.463
- Sure.
- Go to the lake maybe and just unplug...

34:50.464 --> 34:52.549
- Yeah.
- Read, eat great food.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.717
- Absolutely.
- That's what I feel like.

34:54.719 --> 34:55.928
I could use it.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.396
Stephen.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.109
It's all his fault.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.695
- I can't handle it.
- It's young love.

35:12.696 --> 35:14.447
I can't handle it anymore.

35:15.448 --> 35:16.991
It's too much for me.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.244
I have to tell him.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.043
Oh, it's the "Post".

35:27.960 --> 35:29.252
God, it's the "Post".

35:29.253 --> 35:30.963
It's the "Post".
I'm unhappy.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.006
I'm so unhappy there.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.468
It's- oh, it's my editor, Richard.
It's Margo.

35:35.469 --> 35:37.928
It's... I'm so unhappy.

35:39.305 --> 35:42.182
I need to go back to school.

35:42.183 --> 35:43.350
I- I have to change it up.

35:43.351 --> 35:44.601
I gotta change the oil.

35:44.602 --> 35:46.978
I gotta find a career
that actually has some legs,

35:46.979 --> 35:48.229
you know?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.398
I gotta change. I gotta do it.

35:50.399 --> 35:52.693
That's it. That's it.

35:57.823 --> 35:58.991
No.

35:59.909 --> 36:01.368
No.

36:01.369 --> 36:04.913
No, no, no, God, no, no, no.

36:04.914 --> 36:07.082
It's New York.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.793
- I'm unhappy.
- It's ok, baby.

36:08.794 --> 36:10.669
I'm unhappy.

36:10.670 --> 36:12.420
I'm so unhappy there and I-

36:12.421 --> 36:14.297
I can't handle it.

36:14.298 --> 36:15.591
Susannah?

36:16.217 --> 36:17.760
Susannah?

36:19.011 --> 36:22.932
Oh my god!

36:42.910 --> 36:44.495
Am I ok?

36:44.537 --> 36:47.665
It's not for me to say,
but you seem fine to me.

36:47.707 --> 36:50.875
I've seen this dozens of times before,
usually with bankers and Wall Street guys

36:50.876 --> 36:52.461
who come in all stressed out.

36:52.503 --> 36:53.921
There's nothing wrong with them,

36:53.963 --> 36:55.881
it's all in their heads.

36:57.842 --> 36:59.509
Look into my eyes and tell me honestly,

36:59.510 --> 37:01.220
because there's no judgments here.

37:02.555 --> 37:04.515
How much alcohol are you drinking a day?

37:07.059 --> 37:09.602
Maybe a glass of wine at night.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.188
You know,
when my boyfriend comes over or I go to his

37:12.189 --> 37:15.651
we split a bottle but nothing major.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.278
Some beer at gigs.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.572
Any drug use?

37:20.114 --> 37:21.741
Not in a while.

37:23.617 --> 37:25.785
Plain and simple, she's partying too hard.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.495
She's not sleeping
and she's working too hard.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.873
I've seen this happen a lot in young adults

37:29.874 --> 37:32.751
making the transition
from college to working full time.

37:32.752 --> 37:34.586
It's a change in life.
A move to adulthood.

37:34.587 --> 37:35.880
That's what you think this is?

37:36.255 --> 37:39.842
Mrs. Nack, I have nearly
20 years experience in this city.

37:39.884 --> 37:41.134
I've seen it all.

37:41.135 --> 37:44.304
Just make sure she doesn't drink, she takes
the anti-seizure meds that I prescribed

37:44.305 --> 37:45.973
and everything should be fine.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.184
Ok, great.
Thank you.

39:26.115 --> 39:28.868
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!!!!

39:28.909 --> 39:30.619
What the hell?!

39:30.661 --> 39:32.413
What the hell?

39:32.454 --> 39:33.455
Hey!

39:33.539 --> 39:35.708
Hey.

39:35.749 --> 39:37.835
Listen, Susannah.

39:37.877 --> 39:38.919
What are you looking at?!

39:38.961 --> 39:40.671
Huh? Huh?

39:42.006 --> 39:43.465
Susannah, sit down.

39:45.259 --> 39:47.595
I don't know why I'm crying.
I'm broke.

39:47.596 --> 39:49.637
I lost my job,
I don't know what I'm doing here anymore,

39:49.638 --> 39:51.806
Stephen doesn't love me, no one loves me!

39:51.807 --> 39:53.391
I'm lost right now, Margo.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.603
I have nowhere to go.
Nowhere!

39:55.604 --> 39:56.604
Honey.

39:56.812 --> 40:00.356
Honey, you're in the office.

40:00.357 --> 40:03.277
You need to relax a little bit.

40:05.279 --> 40:06.322
Babe.

40:11.118 --> 40:12.119
I'm so happy.

40:12.161 --> 40:13.412
Honey.

40:13.662 --> 40:14.955
I'm so happy.

40:15.873 --> 40:17.875
Margo, I'm so happy!

40:18.500 --> 40:19.834
I know what to do!

40:19.835 --> 40:22.378
Yes, goddammit, yes!

40:22.379 --> 40:24.047
This is it!

40:24.048 --> 40:25.381
I'm so happy!

40:25.382 --> 40:26.759
Margo!

40:27.384 --> 40:29.011
God.

40:30.804 --> 40:32.806
Richard! Richard!

40:32.848 --> 40:34.767
Yes! Yes, Richard!

40:34.808 --> 40:37.186
Come here.
I need to talk to you.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.939
Yes. Yes, god yes!

40:39.980 --> 40:41.607
Ok, goodbye.
Let's go.

40:41.649 --> 40:42.816
Richard, come on.

40:42.858 --> 40:43.859
There is nothing funny.

40:43.901 --> 40:46.528
Go to- get to work. Now.
Now!

40:46.612 --> 40:47.821
Richard, we gotta talk!

40:47.863 --> 40:48.948
Ok. I'm here.

40:48.989 --> 40:50.366
- Come on.
- Yeah.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.201
- Ok.
- What the hell is going on with you?

40:52.242 --> 40:54.286
What are you doing?
I was in a meeting.

40:54.328 --> 40:55.955
I need bigger stories.

40:55.996 --> 40:57.706
Better stories, Richard.

40:57.748 --> 41:02.294
I need to be able to be
a hard-hitting investigator.

41:02.336 --> 41:03.379
And I'm ready for it.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.421
I'm ready for it.

41:04.463 --> 41:08.509
Susannah, you're screaming through the
office, you're talking a mile a minute.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.678
What the hell is going on with you?

41:10.719 --> 41:11.929
I'm excited, Richard.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.347
Have you never seen someone

41:13.389 --> 41:16.099
who's passionate and excited about something?

41:16.100 --> 41:17.726
- Yep-
- And all the workers out there

41:17.727 --> 41:20.436
are trying to type on their computers
and get shit done

41:20.437 --> 41:21.729
but I'm not doing that.

41:21.730 --> 41:24.315
Susannah, when's the last time
you spoke to your family?

41:24.316 --> 41:25.858
I don't even know why this matters here.

41:25.859 --> 41:27.986
What did they say?
Do they see you?

41:27.987 --> 41:30.071
Richard, they support me.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.948
I'm supported by everyone.

41:31.949 --> 41:34.575
But I'm not feeling it from you, Richard,
so that's the question.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.203
Do you support me like my family supports me?

41:37.204 --> 41:38.998
Like Margo supports me?

41:40.374 --> 41:43.167
Or what? Hmm?

41:43.168 --> 41:44.628
I want you to go home.

41:45.295 --> 41:46.671
I'm gonna support you from home.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.382
- I want you to go home.
- Are you firing me?

41:48.383 --> 41:50.718
No, I'm not firing you, I'm sending you home.

41:51.427 --> 41:53.636
Great.
Good talk.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.055
Send me that email.

42:07.026 --> 42:10.195
Yeah, I need Susannah Cahalan's personal file
brought up to me please.

42:10.196 --> 42:12.740
Any contacts for her family.

42:12.781 --> 42:14.408
Yeah, thanks.

43:58.387 --> 44:00.638
I'm sorry, say that again.

44:00.639 --> 44:01.889
I'm bipolar.

44:01.890 --> 44:03.975
Tell me why you think you're bipolar.

44:03.976 --> 44:05.227
I Googled it.

44:05.853 --> 44:06.936
You Googled it?

44:06.937 --> 44:08.104
Yes.

44:08.105 --> 44:11.399
Over the last two weeks I haven't
been able to concentrate, eat, sleep.

44:11.400 --> 44:15.611
I smile, I cry, I laugh,
I-I'm happy, I'm sad.

44:15.612 --> 44:17.781
But what I do know, doctor,

44:18.448 --> 44:20.325
is that I'm a creative person.

44:20.742 --> 44:23.452
I'm creative,
and this happens to creative people.

44:23.453 --> 44:25.455
A lot of creative people are bipolar.

44:26.081 --> 44:27.999
Bipolar is what makes me who I am.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.377
It's just a part of me
and I have to accept that.

44:31.670 --> 44:36.215
Have you ever felt like this
before any time in your life?

44:36.216 --> 44:39.303
I mean, I've always been... energetic.

44:39.970 --> 44:41.805
Ever suicidal?

44:42.639 --> 44:43.640
No.

44:44.057 --> 44:49.354
I mean, everyone daydreams about dying,

44:50.105 --> 44:51.648
but I don't want to die.

44:52.566 --> 44:53.817
Alright.

44:54.610 --> 44:57.487
So I'm bipolar, right?

44:59.198 --> 45:01.032
It's too early to say for sure.

45:01.033 --> 45:04.619
But, you know,
I do see serious signs of mixed episodes,

45:04.620 --> 45:07.747
meaning extremely high highs
and very low lows.

45:07.748 --> 45:10.416
But, uh, I happen to agree with Dr. Samson.

45:10.417 --> 45:12.460
You have a lot going on
in your life right now.

45:12.461 --> 45:15.421
Sometimes that comes across as manic
and depressive elements

45:15.422 --> 45:17.506
typical of bipolar disorder.

45:17.507 --> 45:19.675
But just because
you got a bruise on your face

45:19.676 --> 45:21.261
doesn't mean you've been punched.

45:21.803 --> 45:25.431
So I'm going to give you
a prescription for olanzapine.

45:25.432 --> 45:27.266
It's an antipsychotic prescribed to treat

45:27.267 --> 45:29.353
mood and thought disorders.

45:30.187 --> 45:33.814
Take these pills, check back in with me,

45:33.815 --> 45:35.691
let me know how you're responding,

45:35.692 --> 45:38.570
and we'll make a follow-up
appointment in a month.

45:39.529 --> 45:41.697
Why are you walking away from me right now?

45:41.698 --> 45:43.616
I looked this up, alright?

45:43.617 --> 45:46.077
I'm not just making it up for fun right now.

45:46.078 --> 45:47.203
Listen to me.

45:47.204 --> 45:48.913
You want to hear the side effects?

45:48.914 --> 45:50.915
Euphoria, fever,
general feeling of discomfort,

45:50.916 --> 45:52.750
illness, headache, hyperventilation,

45:52.751 --> 45:54.293
irregular heartbeats, irritability.

45:54.294 --> 45:56.671
Mom, this is it!

45:56.672 --> 45:58.965
It's making me crazy!

45:58.966 --> 46:03.220
Susannah, you have been on them for 24 hours.

46:04.471 --> 46:06.013
No, mom, that doesn't matter, ok?

46:06.014 --> 46:07.390
They're poison!

46:07.391 --> 46:08.934
They're toxic!

46:09.977 --> 46:11.728
- Just take the pills.
- You want me to die?

46:11.729 --> 46:14.397
Take the pills for me.

46:14.398 --> 46:15.856
Do it for your mother.

46:15.857 --> 46:18.068
Take the pills!

46:19.444 --> 46:21.738
Give them a chance to work!

46:22.155 --> 46:23.615
Please!

46:39.464 --> 46:40.882
You know what?

46:42.009 --> 46:43.468
When I die...

46:44.928 --> 46:47.139
I want you to bury me right next to granny.

47:01.403 --> 47:02.821
Bipolar?

47:03.572 --> 47:05.032
That doesn't sound right to me.

47:05.949 --> 47:08.285
Or maybe she's drinking too much.

47:09.161 --> 47:11.245
Are you sure you're not overreacting?

47:11.246 --> 47:13.331
You haven't seen it so you don't know, ok?

47:13.332 --> 47:14.498
I'm not overreacting.

47:14.499 --> 47:19.045
Our daughter is in trouble,
and I am exhausted.

47:19.046 --> 47:22.132
And I need you to- I need you to help me.
I need you to take her.

47:22.758 --> 47:23.842
Ok.

47:24.843 --> 47:27.220
I will keep an eye on her.

47:28.472 --> 47:31.265
And we will get to the bottom
of this if we stick together.

47:31.266 --> 47:32.476
Yeah.

47:33.060 --> 47:34.226
It's intense stuff.

47:34.227 --> 47:36.438
You'll see.
It's really scary.

47:37.481 --> 47:39.274
Ok.

47:41.026 --> 47:44.071
Susannah? Lunch is ready.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.198
It's a lovely day.

47:46.239 --> 47:47.657
It's nice out.

47:49.910 --> 47:51.703
You want juice or water?

47:59.419 --> 48:00.962
You ok?

48:05.050 --> 48:08.053
Why don't you go ahead and take a seat?

48:14.559 --> 48:15.894
Want some bread?

48:21.108 --> 48:23.443
Thank you.

48:23.485 --> 48:24.611
Want some butter?

48:24.653 --> 48:27.364
Oh, no.
I'm good, thank you.

48:36.998 --> 48:38.333
Stop!

48:40.293 --> 48:41.962
Just stop chewing.

48:43.338 --> 48:44.756
Are you gonna eat?

48:46.299 --> 48:47.801
It's your favorite.

48:48.635 --> 48:52.848
Giselle put in a lot of effort
to make this for you.

48:55.267 --> 48:56.601
It was no trouble.

49:07.571 --> 49:09.364
What did you just say to me?

49:10.782 --> 49:13.326
Susannah, I didn't say anything.

49:13.785 --> 49:16.079
Susannah, she said nothing to you.

49:16.788 --> 49:17.955
No.

49:17.956 --> 49:19.498
No, right there.

49:19.499 --> 49:22.461
Right there, you said it again!
You just called me a spoiled brat.

49:22.711 --> 49:24.378
- No, I-
- You just said it!

49:24.379 --> 49:25.421
- You said it again!
- I didn't say-

49:25.422 --> 49:26.505
- Susannah-
- She said it again!

49:26.506 --> 49:29.133
- Calm down.
- Why are you doing this to me? Why?

49:29.134 --> 49:31.552
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you just say that to me?

49:31.553 --> 49:34.013
I haven't done anything to you!
Why did you just say that to me?

49:34.014 --> 49:36.140
- She didn't say anything.
- I heard you say it!

49:36.141 --> 49:38.727
- No, no. Susannah-
- Why did you say that to me?

49:38.935 --> 49:40.102
Susannah! Go to your room!

49:40.103 --> 49:41.313
I just heard you!

49:42.397 --> 49:43.940
What is wrong with you?!

49:45.275 --> 49:46.984
Susannah, what- what is wrong with you?

49:46.985 --> 49:48.402
No.
No, no!

49:48.403 --> 49:49.905
- Tell me.
- No, no, no!

49:49.906 --> 49:51.071
- Tell me what's wrong.
- Get away from me!

49:51.072 --> 49:52.198
I can't help you if you don't

49:52.199 --> 49:53.824
- tell me what's wrong!
- Get away!

49:53.825 --> 49:56.912
Get away!
Get away! Get away!

50:00.749 --> 50:02.542
Giselle is trying to kidnap me!

50:02.584 --> 50:04.002
She tried to kidnap me!

50:04.044 --> 50:06.505
No one tried to kidnap you, you're safe.

50:06.546 --> 50:08.316
Don't touch me, don't touch me!
Don't touch me.

50:08.340 --> 50:10.467
It's ok.
It's ok.

50:10.509 --> 50:11.885
Don't touch me.

50:11.927 --> 50:13.303
Don't touch me.

50:26.983 --> 50:29.236
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok.

50:33.073 --> 50:36.743
Look, her EEG is completely normal,
her MRI is normal,

50:36.785 --> 50:39.495
her neurological exam is normal,
her blood work is all normal.

50:39.496 --> 50:41.497
It's all clear.
It's all normal.

50:41.498 --> 50:42.665
She's drinking too much

50:42.666 --> 50:46.378
and she's exhibiting the classic signs
of alcohol withdrawal.

50:47.045 --> 50:49.129
I know this is hard to
hear about your daughter.

50:49.130 --> 50:51.382
She needs to take her medications,
stop partying,

50:51.383 --> 50:53.008
and get some mental rest.

50:53.009 --> 50:55.511
I haven't seen her have a drink
in over two weeks.

50:55.512 --> 50:58.681
Now, I have been known to enjoy
a glass of wine or two

50:58.682 --> 51:02.227
in my day and all I experienced
was a bad hangover.

51:02.727 --> 51:05.271
Alcohol withdrawal? Are you kidding me?

51:05.272 --> 51:07.357
Do you really think we're gonna believe that?

51:07.774 --> 51:10.985
She needs to be hospitalized.
Now.

51:10.986 --> 51:12.528
Not tomorrow, today.
Now.

51:12.529 --> 51:14.405
And I am not leaving here
until we have a hospital bed

51:14.406 --> 51:17.099
that we can put our daughter into tonight,
so go ahead,

51:17.100 --> 51:18.117
call the police.

51:18.118 --> 51:19.786
I have nothing to lose.

51:23.873 --> 51:25.667
Morning, Susannah.

51:28.003 --> 51:29.671
How are you today?

51:33.550 --> 51:34.883
Thank you.

51:34.884 --> 51:36.845
Would you sit up for me please, Susannah?

51:45.312 --> 51:46.855
Great. Thank you.

51:47.856 --> 51:49.399
How are you feeling?

51:52.319 --> 51:53.337
Susannah, what is wrong with you?

51:53.361 --> 51:56.114
You're falling apart...

51:56.156 --> 51:58.491
You gotta get me outta here.

51:58.617 --> 52:00.702
I don't belong here.

52:01.578 --> 52:04.538
And they're all saying bad stuff about me.

52:04.539 --> 52:06.624
Who's saying bad things about you?

52:06.625 --> 52:08.543
Susannah, what is wrong with you?

52:08.877 --> 52:10.128
Them.

52:10.337 --> 52:12.922
The people on the TV right there.

52:16.134 --> 52:17.344
Ok.

52:26.936 --> 52:29.897
Susannah, can you tell me a little bit

52:29.898 --> 52:33.652
about how you felt before
you came to the hospital?

52:36.738 --> 52:38.698
I felt like I disappeared.

52:39.741 --> 52:41.381
Can you explain that to me a little more.

52:41.618 --> 52:44.120
- Tired.
- Mmmhmm.

52:44.162 --> 52:45.579
Like I wasn't alive.

52:45.580 --> 52:48.499
Now, Susannah,
I'm gonna ask you some basic questions

52:48.500 --> 52:52.420
and I just need you to do your best
to answer them, ok?

52:53.088 --> 52:54.546
What's your name?

52:54.547 --> 52:55.964
Susannah Cahalan.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.132
And do you know what year it is?

52:57.133 --> 52:59.927
- God, can you hear that?
- Hear what?

52:59.928 --> 53:01.054
That.

53:01.304 --> 53:03.055
Susannah, I just need you to focus

53:03.056 --> 53:05.100
and answer my questions, ok?

53:05.141 --> 53:06.600
...the girl who went crazy...

53:06.601 --> 53:08.228
You gotta get me outta here.

53:09.437 --> 53:11.022
- Right now.
- Susannah.

53:11.064 --> 53:12.273
Ok.

53:13.441 --> 53:15.610
Susannah, we're here to help you.

53:16.194 --> 53:17.486
We're not gonna hurt you, ok?

53:17.487 --> 53:18.738
I promise.

53:19.531 --> 53:20.906
- Alright.
- Don't touch me.

53:20.907 --> 53:22.783
Ok.
I want you to-

53:22.784 --> 53:27.372
I want you to hold out your arms
like you're holding a tray, ok?

53:30.583 --> 53:31.710
No.
No.

53:31.711 --> 53:32.541
Nope.

53:32.544 --> 53:33.712
No.
No.

53:33.753 --> 53:35.338
I'm not doing anymore.

53:35.588 --> 53:36.755
Why are you interrogating me?

53:36.756 --> 53:39.174
I'm not interrogating you, Susannah.
I'm-

53:39.175 --> 53:41.343
- Get out! Get out of my room.
- Ok.

53:41.344 --> 53:43.722
We're gonna leave you
alone now, ok, Susannah?

53:51.980 --> 53:54.107
I recorded some of my songs.

53:54.899 --> 53:57.652
When you listen to
it you'll remember some stuff.

54:02.657 --> 54:07.245
Hey, talk to me, Susannah.

54:09.247 --> 54:10.623
Please.

54:17.172 --> 54:21.342
I'm... I'm scared.

54:22.177 --> 54:24.928
I just... god, Stephen.

54:24.929 --> 54:30.810
I feel like everyone here is just...
talking about me.

54:31.311 --> 54:33.103
I need you.

54:33.104 --> 54:34.105
Hey.

54:34.272 --> 54:35.815
Listen to me.

54:37.609 --> 54:39.902
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

54:39.903 --> 54:42.447
And we're gonna get through it together.

54:44.282 --> 54:47.327
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

54:51.998 --> 54:54.334
I have multiple personality disorder.

54:55.293 --> 54:57.586
Have you been diagnosed by any psychiatrists

54:57.587 --> 54:58.838
or psychologists?

54:59.923 --> 55:01.256
No.

55:01.257 --> 55:03.300
I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist

55:03.301 --> 55:06.553
with bipolar disorder but
not multiple personality.

55:06.554 --> 55:10.098
And were you taking any medication for that?

55:10.099 --> 55:13.812
No. They tried to but I refused to take it.

55:14.437 --> 55:15.939
I spit it out.

55:19.275 --> 55:22.110
Dr. Khan I need to get out of here.

55:22.111 --> 55:24.238
It's not safe for me here anymore.

55:24.239 --> 55:25.949
Why is it not safe for you here?

55:26.574 --> 55:28.284
They're talking about me.

55:29.035 --> 55:30.495
All of 'em.

55:37.752 --> 55:39.045
I can hear 'em.

55:39.712 --> 55:43.466
The nurses, they're talking about me.

55:44.300 --> 55:46.010
I can hear their thoughts.

55:47.178 --> 55:48.596
You can hear their thoughts?

55:51.307 --> 55:55.687
Yeah. They think I can't hear them, but I do.

55:56.479 --> 55:58.565
I hear them loud and clear.

55:59.983 --> 56:01.734
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.460
Help!

57:17.685 --> 57:19.020
No!

57:20.438 --> 57:22.815
No!!!!!!!

57:57.141 --> 57:58.810
Help!!!!!

58:02.855 --> 58:05.148
I can assume two possible diagnoses.

58:05.149 --> 58:08.318
First, presentation of schizophrenia

58:08.319 --> 58:10.530
versus postictal psychosis.

58:10.571 --> 58:14.157
Now, she is clearly
psychotic but the question is

58:14.158 --> 58:16.451
where is this psychotic behavior coming from?

58:16.452 --> 58:18.453
I'm going to prescribe haloperidol,

58:18.454 --> 58:19.830
it should sedate her enough

58:19.831 --> 58:21.331
so that we can do some further testing

58:21.332 --> 58:23.834
but if her behavior doesn't improve

58:23.835 --> 58:26.336
I think we should look at hospitals

58:26.337 --> 58:28.422
that are better equipped to deal
with her problems.

58:28.423 --> 58:31.009
No. No.

58:31.968 --> 58:35.679
Our daughter is not going into a psych ward.

58:35.680 --> 58:37.389
How do you explain the seizures?

58:37.390 --> 58:39.933
How do you explain that
she has never been like this

58:39.934 --> 58:41.102
before in her life?

58:42.562 --> 58:44.855
How...
how can you just arrive at this conclusion

58:44.856 --> 58:46.858
without all of the facts?

58:47.984 --> 58:50.193
Dr. Ryan,
why don't you do that further testing

58:50.194 --> 58:53.156
before you threaten us
with psychiatric hospitals?

59:13.426 --> 59:16.220
Steps to the right,

59:18.806 --> 59:21.517
Take them all night,

59:24.145 --> 59:26.939
It don't bother me,

59:29.609 --> 59:32.361
You don't have to leave,

59:35.073 --> 59:37.784
You don't want to leave,

59:40.328 --> 59:43.247
But you'll never see me,

59:45.875 --> 59:48.586
You don't have to leave,

59:51.255 --> 59:54.217
But you'll never see me...

01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:02.265
Well?

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.517
They have nothing.

01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:04.893
Nothing?

01:00:04.894 --> 01:00:06.812
She's been here over a week,
I mean, they have to have something.

01:00:06.813 --> 01:00:08.730
They don't know. Each of them is
giving us a different diagnosis.

01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:11.525
One is saying bipolar, the next one is saying

01:00:11.526 --> 01:00:13.777
schizophrenic then they're saying psychotic.

01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:15.821
- I don't know.
- What does that even mean?

01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:17.614
It means nobody knows
what the hell is going on,

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:18.741
that's what it means.

01:00:19.367 --> 01:00:20.450
She's not psychotic.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:21.827
Whatever it is, it's not that.

01:00:21.828 --> 01:00:22.911
I agree, I think it is-

01:00:22.912 --> 01:00:26.331
I think it's just the most
convenient explanation for them

01:00:26.332 --> 01:00:28.333
so we need to continue
putting pressure on them

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:31.378
so that they continue to investigate, ok?

01:00:31.379 --> 01:00:33.297
It's important.
Pressure.

01:00:34.924 --> 01:00:36.299
Well, I just want you both to know

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.384
I plan on being here every day

01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:39.011
until they do figure out what's wrong.

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:41.889
I want to be with her,
and she needs all of us.

01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:45.017
Thank you, Stephen.

01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:48.186
I appreciate that.

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:49.272
Excuse us.

01:01:19.802 --> 01:01:22.096
We're looking at neurological causes here...

01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:04.347
Susannah!

01:02:23.241 --> 01:02:24.659
Hello.

01:02:25.451 --> 01:02:26.827
Hi.

01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:30.414
Don't get too excited.

01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:33.125
You look great.

01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:36.962
I brought you some fake flowers.

01:02:36.963 --> 01:02:38.756
Am I ok to hug you?

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:46.097
Oh, I'm just... I'm just gonna do it.

01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:50.518
Hey, babe.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:56.232
So, what?
You don't talk to me now?

01:03:06.284 --> 01:03:09.328
I have something for you.

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.081
It's very disappointing.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.626
It's a piece of crap ugly card!

01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:18.211
And everybody made it in the office,

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:20.006
everybody signed it,

01:03:20.506 --> 01:03:24.259
and a lot of people said some really,
really sappy things

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.721
that you and I would have made fun of.

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:29.390
Even Richard signed it.

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:32.183
I think he really misses you.

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:34.854
You're like his little apprentice.

01:03:37.023 --> 01:03:38.566
And I miss you.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.697
And he misses you.

01:03:45.323 --> 01:03:46.449
This is...

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.452
I'll put this here.

01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:52.121
We can make fun of it later.

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:33.995
We've tested Susannah for every
infectious disease that we know of.

01:04:33.996 --> 01:04:36.081
All of the results are negative,

01:04:36.082 --> 01:04:39.626
including Lyme disease,
toxoplasmosis, cryptococccus,

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:41.586
lymphorheticulosis, tuberculosis,

01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:42.671
and many, many more.

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:44.881
All of the tests being negative suggest

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:48.009
that Susannah has a
primary psychiatric illness

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:51.513
which I feel is likely schizophrenia.

01:04:51.514 --> 01:04:53.264
So what does all of this mean?

01:04:53.265 --> 01:04:57.436
Maybe this is not
the right hospital to treat her.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.938
Perhaps Susannah should be transferred

01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:02.233
to a psychiatric hospital.

01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:05.151
Ok, look.

01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:07.987
I'm going to continue to
monitor Susannah on a daily basis

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.906
for the next three days.

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:12.450
Let's just hope that something shows up

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:14.702
and we can figure out a way of solving this

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.079
and getting your daughter better.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.373
Something?

01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:21.376
I- I don't understand this.

01:05:21.377 --> 01:05:24.629
Our daughter is dying in there.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:28.800
The tests are not showing us that
she is dying, Mr. Cahalan.

01:05:28.801 --> 01:05:32.429
The tests are saying that
she is a healthy, young woman.

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.932
- She is clearly suffering and we are-
- I want answers.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:38.977
- It is your job to give us answers!
- Mr. Cahalan-

01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:42.105
No, this ain't some kid's club
where you get to play doctor.

01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:43.481
This is my daughter's life!

01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:46.067
Her life is in your hands and I want answers!

01:05:46.068 --> 01:05:48.736
Tell me what is wrong with my daughter!

01:05:48.737 --> 01:05:49.988
The truth is, Mr. Cahalan,

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.865
that we don't know
what is wrong with Susannah.

01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:54.993
We work and make decisions based on facts

01:05:54.994 --> 01:05:57.245
and, at this point, we don't have any.

01:05:57.246 --> 01:06:00.457
We're sorry that
there's nothing more that we can do.

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:04.043
- Excuse me.
- We already have a bed on stand-by

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:06.088
and we're just waiting for your decision.

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:49.548
Fully catatonic.

01:07:16.617 --> 01:07:17.785
Hey.

01:07:20.204 --> 01:07:21.413
You ok?

01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:23.165
Yeah.

01:07:26.919 --> 01:07:28.420
So how are you holding up?

01:07:29.964 --> 01:07:31.966
It shouldn't be like this, you know?

01:07:33.759 --> 01:07:35.969
I know she's still in there.

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.346
She's just trapped.

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:39.055
When I look in her eyes

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.058
I can see her screaming to get out.

01:07:43.018 --> 01:07:45.436
I thought, of all people,
you doctors, you know,

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:48.524
you'd be able to give us some hope, you know?

01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:51.277
I mean, that's your job, right?

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.951
I wish you all a fantastic weekend.

01:07:59.952 --> 01:08:03.580
Thank you.
And please, pace yourself.

01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:06.292
I want to see you in my class next week.

01:08:08.961 --> 01:08:12.089
Wow, Dr. Khan.

01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:14.924
To what do I owe this pleasure?

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.385
I need your help.

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:18.344
I teach now.

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:20.138
Leave me in peace.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:21.848
21 year old female.

01:08:21.849 --> 01:08:23.600
Right-handed.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.352
Her symptoms began with manic behavior,

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:28.062
paranoia, erratic outbursts.

01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:31.274
That lead to a general seizure,
which lead to another one,

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.774
which lead to a third.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:37.448
Her condition continues to regress every day.

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:41.993
Sabrina, I teach now.

01:08:42.703 --> 01:08:45.078
What's crazy is that, prior to this,

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.331
she was completely healthy.

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:48.541
She was on no medication whatsoever.

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:50.627
Her physical exams were normal,

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.629
her neurological exams were normal.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:56.215
Infection work out negative,
auto-immune tests negative,

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:58.091
toxic metabolic work up negative.

01:08:58.093 --> 01:08:59.426
All of it was negative.

01:08:59.428 --> 01:09:02.973
I admit, it sounds very interesting.

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:05.683
But like I said, I teach now.

01:09:05.684 --> 01:09:08.310
She's on the verge of going to
a psychiatric hospital.

01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:10.563
Dr. Khan, based on what you're telling me,

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:11.982
maybe that's where she should be.

01:09:12.066 --> 01:09:15.359
No. It would be very easy for me to tell her

01:09:15.361 --> 01:09:16.778
that she's bipolar or schizophrenic,

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:19.154
but the fact is there's
just something in my bones

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:21.617
that's telling me that
that's just not the case.

01:09:22.368 --> 01:09:23.786
I know the feeling.

01:09:24.495 --> 01:09:28.288
Ok, I will take a peek.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.625
Great.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.711
I wonder what he'll be like.

01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:36.006
- Huh.
- Hopefully competent.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:40.801
- Good day.
- Hello.

01:09:40.803 --> 01:09:41.886
Hi. I'm Rhona.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:43.638
I'm Susannah's mother.

01:09:43.639 --> 01:09:45.015
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

01:09:45.099 --> 01:09:46.182
Tom. I'm her dad.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:48.600
Tom. I'm Dr. Najjar.

01:09:48.602 --> 01:09:52.981
And you must be the famous Susannah.

01:09:54.483 --> 01:09:56.026
Call me Souhel.

01:09:57.152 --> 01:09:58.862
The pleasure is all mine.

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:03.533
So, um, please.
Have a seat.

01:10:03.534 --> 01:10:04.743
Ok.

01:10:07.079 --> 01:10:08.454
Susannah?

01:10:08.455 --> 01:10:10.873
I will do my best to help you.

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:12.709
I will not hurt you.

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.628
I will never lie to you.

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:16.671
Ok?

01:10:16.672 --> 01:10:18.172
Ok.

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:19.466
Let's begin.

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:21.969
What is your name?

01:10:27.433 --> 01:10:29.268
What is the year?

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:56.544
We need to stay strong for Susannah.

01:10:56.545 --> 01:10:57.838
I know.

01:10:59.757 --> 01:11:02.593
Hey. We'll get through this.

01:11:04.136 --> 01:11:05.596
Yeah, I hope so.

01:11:07.765 --> 01:11:13.353
Can you touch your nose with this hand?

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:37.085
Very good.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:57.773
Stephen?

01:11:58.357 --> 01:12:00.567
What's wrong?
Is she ok?

01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:04.822
Mr. Cahalan.
Hey.

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.448
You know what?

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:10.952
Why don't you call me Tom?
After all you've been through

01:12:10.953 --> 01:12:13.413
I think you can call me
"asshole" if you want.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.335
Thanks.

01:12:19.795 --> 01:12:22.047
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

01:12:27.261 --> 01:12:29.596
Now, will you walk for me?

01:12:31.974 --> 01:12:34.142
Get out of the bed.

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:42.401
No, no, she can do this herself.

01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:48.489
I need you to walk for me in a straight line.

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.034
One foot in front of the other.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.501
Ok, ok.

01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:04.256
It all looks clear.

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:06.299
It is, it's perfectly clear.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.843
What am I missing?

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.188
Susannah?

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:23.232
Would you draw a clock for me?

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:27.070
And fill in all the numbers
from one through twelve?

01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:41.043
Just as you remember.

01:13:44.922 --> 01:13:46.381
Very good.

01:13:50.135 --> 01:13:52.304
Now, fill in the numbers.

01:13:53.138 --> 01:13:55.390
One through twelve.

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:13.533
Dr. Najjar, what do you see?

01:14:20.832 --> 01:14:22.333
I'm working late tonight.

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:24.251
No, everything is fine.

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.504
Yes.

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:12.217
Dr. Ryan, it's Souhel.

01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:14.885
Yes, yes.

01:15:14.886 --> 01:15:18.598
Uh, but I think I have something
you might be interested in.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.268
Good morning.

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:23.728
- Hello.
- Good morning.

01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:25.230
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:28.691
I may have some explanation for you.

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:31.318
I believe the right hemisphere of her brain

01:15:31.319 --> 01:15:33.904
is seriously impaired and inflamed.

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:35.197
A broken brain.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.074
When one hemisphere is not working

01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:39.828
the visual world becomes lopsided.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.997
Like this clock.

01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:44.790
No one with a psychiatric problem

01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:46.501
would draw a clock like this.

01:15:46.752 --> 01:15:49.128
So this should rule out schizophrenia

01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:50.881
and bipolar disorder.

01:15:52.007 --> 01:15:55.843
Now, what is causing this inflammation,

01:15:55.844 --> 01:15:58.221
that is the question that we have to answer.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.560
My dear, I know you are in there.

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:07.314
I'm going to do everything I can to find you.

01:16:08.148 --> 01:16:09.774
Before we move onto treatment

01:16:09.775 --> 01:16:12.359
we need to confirm
the cause of the inflammation.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.321
I think the best thing to do
is to do a brain biopsy.

01:16:15.322 --> 01:16:17.032
What does that mean?

01:16:17.491 --> 01:16:19.408
We have to look at the brain.

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:21.243
We have to take a small piece of her brain

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.870
to confirm the diagnosis

01:16:22.871 --> 01:16:25.123
before we can proceed with the treatment.

01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:26.875
I don't know.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.087
Once again, I promise you.

01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:32.588
If she were my child,

01:16:32.589 --> 01:16:34.423
I would do the brain biopsy.

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.383
Time is of the essence here.

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:38.929
I know it sounds invasive,
but we are losing her.

01:16:43.517 --> 01:16:45.267
We're gonna shave the front part of your head

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:48.646
about four inches in toward the crown.

01:16:48.647 --> 01:16:51.065
Then we'll make an incision
and take the sample.

01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:52.566
I'll be here for you in the morning.

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:53.776
7:00 am.

01:16:53.777 --> 01:16:56.846
Please get some rest tonight, and no eating.

01:16:56.847 --> 01:16:57.848
Only fasting.

01:16:57.906 --> 01:16:59.116
Thank you.

01:17:07.374 --> 01:17:08.542
You ok?

01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:10.459
I just don't want us
to get our hopes up again.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.336
- How do you mean?
- Rhona, we've been here for over a month.

01:17:12.337 --> 01:17:14.630
We've had so many doctors, so many opinions,

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:16.215
so many theories, so many ups

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:18.217
that unfortunately all had major downs.

01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:19.593
Who says this guy has all the answers?

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:21.263
Ok, ok. Look at me.

01:17:22.597 --> 01:17:23.639
If this guy doesn't have the answers

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.227
we will go to the next guy or
the next woman until we find the answer.

01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:31.147
Ok? But what I need from you,
right here, right now,

01:17:31.148 --> 01:17:33.859
is I need to know: are you in?

01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:39.281
Because I need you and Susannah needs you.

01:18:13.523 --> 01:18:14.732
Good afternoon.

01:18:14.733 --> 01:18:15.774
Some news.

01:18:15.775 --> 01:18:20.571
The result came back conclusive for
NMDA receptor antibodies.

01:18:20.572 --> 01:18:23.115
- What is it?
- Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:26.869
is an autoimmune disease
where antibodies target

01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:30.665
and attack very important
receptors in the brain.

01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:32.208
I- I don't understand.

01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:35.503
Can you simplify what it is you're saying?

01:18:35.921 --> 01:18:40.132
To put it simply,
her brain is on fire and under attack

01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:42.177
from her own body.

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:43.803
Ok.

01:18:44.304 --> 01:18:47.390
So... what happens next?

01:18:47.933 --> 01:18:49.475
We can treat this.

01:18:49.476 --> 01:18:51.769
We got this in the very early stages.

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.062
I think she will be fine.

01:18:53.063 --> 01:18:56.942
She will be getting 90% of her
cognitive abilities back.

01:18:57.484 --> 01:19:01.071
So... we might get her fully back.

01:19:01.655 --> 01:19:05.199
As I said, Mr. Cahalan,
there's a serious possibility

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:10.247
but let's just hope
her body welcomes the treatment.

01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:13.708
Thank you so much.

01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:21.424
You are going to be just fine.

01:19:22.926 --> 01:19:24.761
I found you.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:29.139
I am the lucky one.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.849
Because, in a system that's designed

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.142
to miss people like me...

01:19:32.143 --> 01:19:33.811
I will start the treatment.

01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:35.104
Thank you.

01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:38.148
Thanks to Dr. Najjar, I was found.

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:39.818
He found me.

01:19:45.699 --> 01:19:48.326
My body was attacking my brain.

01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:52.872
It completely destroyed
my ability to function.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:58.335
How many people
do you think throughout history

01:19:58.336 --> 01:20:01.588
were diagnosed as schizophrenic,
psychotic, bipolar,

01:20:01.589 --> 01:20:04.342
or maybe just plain crazy

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:08.012
when they had something
that could have been so easily diagnosed?

01:20:08.013 --> 01:20:09.723
It took you forever to get home.

01:20:11.391 --> 01:20:12.559
I brought you this.

01:20:17.022 --> 01:20:18.231
I love you.

01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:20.525
So much.

01:20:22.193 --> 01:20:23.903
Susannah.

01:20:24.154 --> 01:20:25.904
You can't say no.

01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:29.326
Oh my god,
you had a back-up the whole time.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:30.618
Let's go.

01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:35.999
No, no.

01:20:37.334 --> 01:20:38.876
You know what?

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:40.544
If we're gonna make
the New York City marathon this year,

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:42.589
we got a hell of a lot of work to do, kid.

01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:47.927
Please don't quit your day job.

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:50.929
Because you're definitely not a comedian.

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.849
Well, it's nice
you got your personality back.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.142
Come on, baby. You can do it.

01:20:55.143 --> 01:20:57.354
I had to learn everything from scratch.

01:20:57.979 --> 01:21:02.359
How to walk again, how to talk again, smile,

01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:04.486
how to be a daughter.

01:21:05.153 --> 01:21:06.946
To love Stephen again.

01:21:07.572 --> 01:21:09.157
How to write.

01:21:10.075 --> 01:21:11.701
I had to learn how to exist again.

01:21:13.828 --> 01:21:15.455
So how the hell are you?

01:21:15.622 --> 01:21:16.748
I'm good.

01:21:17.165 --> 01:21:18.416
Yeah.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.293
Yeah, you know, I'm on-
I'm on some medication still

01:21:21.294 --> 01:21:24.004
but I'm good.

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:26.090
I read your first article since your return.

01:21:26.091 --> 01:21:28.926
- Don't. It- it's not too good.
- No, no.

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:30.052
Don't put words in my mouth.

01:21:30.053 --> 01:21:31.638
It's actually really good.

01:21:31.913 --> 01:21:32.930
Yeah. Better than ever.

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:35.516
So much so that uh, congratulations.

01:21:35.517 --> 01:21:37.018
Your first page two.

01:21:38.386 --> 01:21:39.395
Wow.

01:21:39.396 --> 01:21:40.897
Yeah. Big deal, right?

01:21:41.356 --> 01:21:43.065
Yeah. Thank you.

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:44.859
There's something else I want from you.

01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:48.779
I want you to tell your story.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.240
From beginning to end.

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:54.744
I want the people of New York
to know what you went through.

01:21:56.287 --> 01:21:59.456
I want you to write a first-person
feature about it.

01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:01.792
It's kinda hard putting your own personal
information out there

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:03.586
but you should really consider it.

01:22:06.214 --> 01:22:07.507
You know...

01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:11.261
why not?

01:22:12.095 --> 01:22:13.221
Yeah?

01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:17.808
Yeah, I mean, if it- if it helps
someone out there, maybe...

01:22:17.809 --> 01:22:19.769
- Yeah.
- It's worth it.

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:21.937
That's great.

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:24.565
It'll take a little bit of time
to compile it, I think, but...

01:22:24.566 --> 01:22:27.317
Oh, yeah, no, take all the time you need.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:29.362
As long as I can have it by Friday.

01:22:31.573 --> 01:22:32.865
You'll have it by Thursday night.

01:22:32.866 --> 01:22:34.659
Don't worry.

01:22:37.078 --> 01:22:38.371
Thanks, Susannah.

01:22:53.428 --> 01:22:54.971
You ok?

01:22:56.473 --> 01:22:58.391
Yeah, I'm good.

01:22:59.267 --> 01:23:00.809
I got used to people asking me

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.312
about my rare and fascinating illness.

01:23:03.313 --> 01:23:05.397
I never tried to articulate it, though.

01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:07.025
Are you sure you're ok?

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:10.153
- Margo?
- Yeah?

01:23:10.195 --> 01:23:11.236
I'm great.

01:23:11.237 --> 01:23:13.030
- Never better.
- Ok.

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.073
Good.

01:23:14.282 --> 01:23:15.825
Stop talking to me.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:19.954
This new Susannah is
a lot like the old Susannah,

01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:22.248
but she's so much stronger.

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:25.918
Because for the very first time
I feel ready to tackle

01:23:25.919 --> 01:23:28.587
the mystery of what happened to me.

01:23:28.588 --> 01:23:30.548
To find an answer.

01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:34.219
An answer that could possibly save a life.
