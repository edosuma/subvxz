WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:06.798
‐ It's nobody else's job
to chase your dreams for you.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.342
Checkmate.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.468
‐ This is perfect.

00:09.468 --> 00:10.928
It looks great.
Trust me.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.971
‐ Prince Rakeem strikes again.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.223
Hey, I left
Prince Rakeem

00:14.223 --> 00:15.641
in a cell in Ohio.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.267
Nefertiti was a beautiful,

00:17.267 --> 00:20.521
powerful African queen,
know what I mean?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.897
You the modern version.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.899
‐ Dennis, I told you
we need our own place.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.235
And I told you
we can't rent another spot,

00:26.235 --> 00:27.694
because we gonna blow
through our savings

00:27.694 --> 00:29.321
in, like, two months.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.156
‐ Take it.
‐ Ma.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.449
‐ Please.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.952
‐ A young buck selling drugs
and such

00:34.952 --> 00:36.578
who never had much.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.455
U‐I'm down to commit
with this Wu‐Tang shit,

00:38.455 --> 00:39.748
but that music shit
ain't putting

00:39.748 --> 00:41.291
no food on the table right now.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.210
‐ I'm just asking y'all niggas
to take the first step.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.420
After that, I got y'all.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.298
We produced a single
that's getting mad airplay.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.509
‐ We feel like now it's time
for us to sign with a label

00:50.509 --> 00:53.095
and, uh, you know,
take over this whole game.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.852
‐ "Protect Ya Neck" got me wet.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.854
‐ This could be our one shot,
know what I mean?

01:26.378 --> 01:27.546
‐ You might have gotten me
with that

01:27.546 --> 01:29.423
if I didn't catch it,

01:29.423 --> 01:30.966
but I did.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.802
Now your ass
ain't going nowhere.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.724
Yo, that move is short money.

01:38.724 --> 01:42.603
You gotta think long money,
you dig, Prince Rakeem?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.479
‐ You think you got it
all figured out, huh?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.984
I used to be just like you...

01:52.529 --> 01:54.698
Once upon a time.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.722
‐ Just because you changed
your name, RZA,

03:00.722 --> 03:02.724
don't mean
you on top of the game.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.018
‐ You're one to talk,
motherfucker.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.938
You fell for that
shitty single deal.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.856
At least I know

03:09.856 --> 03:13.026
I need a guaranteed album
and a release date.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.238
‐ Oh, because you're so much
smarter after you got dropped?

03:16.238 --> 03:19.282
Yo, how did Ohio
work out for you?

03:19.282 --> 03:20.409
‐ Hey, I'm here now, ain't I?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.703
‐ You're here talking shit,
nigga.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.247
What does that‐‐
that long money‐‐

03:25.247 --> 03:26.957
long money shit mean anyway?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.250
‐ Freedom.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.419
Creatively and business‐wise.

03:35.674 --> 03:36.675
Checkmate.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.556
‐ You know what?
Yeah.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.810
I may have taken an L,
but that was just me.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.437
You, on the other hand,

03:48.437 --> 03:51.398
are responsible
for a lot more people, RZA.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.025
I mean, you basically demanded
that your family,

03:54.025 --> 03:58.280
your brothers,
put their fate in your hands.

03:58.280 --> 04:02.909
You explain that long money‐
short money shit to them?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.744
Hmm?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.419
I have to say,
I fucking love the record.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.879
I love that it doesn't have
a hook,

04:13.879 --> 04:15.755
that it represents
what hip‐hop was,

04:15.755 --> 04:17.174
and that it doesn't follow
any rules.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.425
I love that.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.886
I want us to ride
the momentum of the single.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.637
‐ We're happy that you believe
in the single.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.182
What are your thoughts
about an album?

04:27.726 --> 04:29.561
I can't tell you
how excited I am

04:29.561 --> 04:31.104
to discuss the possibilities.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.649
RZA, you are
such a creative guy.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.693
Putting out "Protect Ya Neck"
independently.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.237
Doing all
the artwork yourselves.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.408
And that sword?
That was dope.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.911
But I think I can do you
one better in that department.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.874
‐ Oh, shit.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.417
‐ There's a message
on there for you.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.887
‐ Ooh, that's a lot
of zeros, kid.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.305
That's a nice little flip,
right?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.848
‐ Mm‐hmm,
straight up and down, huh?

05:09.059 --> 05:12.813
‐ Yeah.
I don't know, yo.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.316
I feel like that suit didn't
really answer my questions.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.194
‐ Aw, come on, Bobby.
He's a businessman.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.821
Course he ain't gonna
guarantee you an album

05:20.821 --> 05:22.030
if he doesn't have to.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.240
‐ Right, right.
‐ Yeah, well,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.617
if he wants Wu‐Tang,
he'll have to.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.369
I did this shit
the label's way before.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.163
Now this time,
they gotta agree to our terms.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.082
‐ Ah, it's all good,
little bro.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.667
This is our first meeting.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.252
You know,
we're just getting started,

05:35.252 --> 05:36.378
know what I mean?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.504
And Def Jam wants
to meet last,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.005
know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.844
‐ I've been paging Divine
all day.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.805
He hasn't called me back.
‐ Yeah.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.974
They were just at Mr. Chow's
with you‐know‐who.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.018
‐ Fuck.
We need more money, Rich.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.313
‐ Steve, we're
a brand‐new label.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.190
Can't break the bank
before we start it.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.109
We signed Mad Kap,
we paid 30 for Tha Alkaholiks,

05:59.109 --> 06:01.278
and now you wanna blow
through the rest of our budget?

06:01.278 --> 06:03.029
Once we spend that money,
that's it.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.573
We're betting it all
on Wu‐Tang.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.283
‐ Yeah.
They're worth it.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.285
I just need ten minutes
with them, okay?

06:08.285 --> 06:09.744
Face‐to‐face.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.121
‐ I'll keep asking around.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.249
I think I know
where they're recording.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.138
‐ Hey.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.557
‐ Your favorite.
‐ My favorite?

06:30.557 --> 06:31.975
I think you like those
more than me.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.768
‐ Hey, yo, I wasn't the one
that finished

06:33.768 --> 06:36.229
the whole box last time,
know what I mean?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.774
‐ What's all that?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.027
‐ A job application.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.029
‐ Job application?

06:44.029 --> 06:45.238
Nia says
she can hook me up

06:45.238 --> 06:47.157
with a job at Bay Video.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.367
Mm‐hmm, every dollar counts.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.631
‐ Hey, yo, we gonna be
signed soon, all right?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.051
The money coming any day now.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.637
‐ It's not just about money.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.555
It's about purpose.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.724
You and the guys have been
going town to town

07:12.724 --> 07:15.935
and college to college,
pushing the record.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.438
I wanna do something
like that for myself.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.901
It's kind of like
when you got me this necklace.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.571
You were saying how Nefertiti
is beautiful and powerful.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.991
Real power is taking life
into your own hands.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.788
‐ Yeah. I feel that.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.071
‐ Word!

08:14.494 --> 08:16.788
with the artificial flow

08:40.478 --> 08:42.647
‐ Yo, what up?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.357
Hey, yo.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.444
So Ray was thinking about
replacing that "Gigante" verse

08:47.444 --> 08:49.571
with the 16 from
"Lifestyle of the Mega Rich."

08:49.571 --> 08:50.739
How you feel?

08:50.739 --> 08:53.199
‐ I don't know.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.869
‐ What you mean‐‐
what you mean you don't know?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.163
‐ How we gonna talk about
lifestyles of the mega rich

08:58.163 --> 08:59.706
when we all broker
than a motherfucker?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.753
‐ Well, shit, we still
taking meetings with labels.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.463
You know, if we had the money
to break y'all off‐‐

09:06.463 --> 09:07.672
‐ Yo, I wasn't saying
like that.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.174
I'm just saying...

09:13.011 --> 09:15.930
‐ So what you thinking?

09:15.930 --> 09:18.558
‐ I wrote this when I was
locked up, you know.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.684
I ain't never really spit

09:19.684 --> 09:21.019
nothing like this
before, though.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.645
‐ All right.
Let's hear it.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.814
‐ It's been
22 long, hard years.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.066
I'm still struggling.

09:26.066 --> 09:30.028
Survival got me bugging,
but I'm alive on arrival.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.655
I peep at the shape
of the streets.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.949
Stay awake
to the ways of the world,

09:34.949 --> 09:37.660
'cause shit is deep.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.829
That shit's fucking deep,
yo.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.122
Word.
‐ Word up.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.248
‐ Word, son.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.084
‐ That's deep, dog. Word.
‐ Yeah.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.669
‐ All right, let's see how
that shit sounds in the booth.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.129
Word, word.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.547
‐ Hey, what's up, fellas?

09:49.547 --> 09:52.300
‐ Hey, what's up, son?
Y'all from Def Jam, right?

09:52.300 --> 09:53.760
‐ No.
Uh...

09:53.760 --> 09:55.261
‐ Shit.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.222
Damn, when is that meeting
happening, son?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.765
‐ Bobby, Steve Rifkind.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.100
You remember me?

10:01.476 --> 10:03.728
‐ Oh, shit, yo.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.190
What's up, man?
Yo, long time, no see, man.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.650
‐ I've been good, good.
You?

10:08.650 --> 10:10.443
‐ Word, word. Yeah, yeah.
Been good. Been good.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.070
Right.
Is there, uh,

10:12.070 --> 10:14.572
somewhere
we can talk for a minute?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.783
I've always dug your sound.
My whole office does.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.827
I've been trying to track
you guys down for months.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.912
‐ Yo, word.
‐ That's cool and all that,

10:20.912 --> 10:23.123
you know what I'm saying,
but, no disrespect,

10:23.123 --> 10:25.041
what other acts
have you put out on your label?

10:25.041 --> 10:27.210
‐ Yeah, look, I've, uh‐‐
I've managed and marketed

10:27.210 --> 10:28.962
some of the top acts
in the game,

10:28.962 --> 10:31.881
before starting my own label,
Loud Records.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.591
Right now, we got
Tha Alkaholiks

10:33.591 --> 10:35.009
from the West Coast,

10:35.009 --> 10:37.512
Twista from the Midwest.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.055
You guys can rep the East.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.558
You know, we're young.
We're hungry.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.060
We're gonna give you all
the fucking attention you need.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.604
I want Loud to be the house
that Wu‐Tang built.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.649
‐ He means it.
Really.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.110
‐ We want freedom.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.404
Creative freedom.
Business freedom.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.198
‐ Yeah, well,
we're not A&amp;Rs, okay,

10:57.198 --> 11:00.326
so you do
what you do creatively.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.911
Our job is, we just go out
and sell it.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.581
‐ Okay, respectfully, uh,
we have some big meetings

11:04.581 --> 11:06.958
with some bigwigs who have
made names for themselves,

11:06.958 --> 11:09.669
who have made history
with their artists,

11:09.669 --> 11:11.880
and who also have
bigger budgets

11:11.880 --> 11:13.173
to take bigger risks.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.467
So why should we go
with a new label, hmm?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.014
We need to get more money.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.855
‐ We made it work this far,

11:28.855 --> 11:30.231
but you and me made a deal

11:30.231 --> 11:32.066
to get on top of the rap game.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.402
To get on top,
I need a bigger budget.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.698
‐ Boys, I thought we were
going over marketing here.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.993
‐ Wu‐Tang already has
a six‐figure bid on the table,

11:41.993 --> 11:43.953
and they're meeting
with other top labels soon.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.831
‐ That means higher offers.
Right.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.917
Come on, Skip.

11:48.917 --> 11:54.088
‐ Steve...I like your dad.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.674
We both made our bones
in this industry.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.761
I think you've forgotten
you don't have a track record.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.305
Remember, I'm taking
a chance on Loud,

12:02.305 --> 12:04.849
but risk has its limits.

12:06.017 --> 12:09.520
I can't keep sticking
my neck out for Loud Records.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.397
‐ I get it, Skip, okay,

12:11.397 --> 12:13.983
but we both know that RCA's
in the shitter right now.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.276
And I'm telling you

12:15.276 --> 12:17.320
that Wu‐Tang
can pull the label out from it.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.448
I don't expect you
to understand hip‐hop, okay,

12:20.448 --> 12:22.742
so let me explain it
to you like this.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.913
This company was built
on American grassroots music,

12:26.913 --> 12:30.625
guys playing the banjo
and blowing into jugs.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.210
Well, hip‐hop's
the modern version of that,

12:32.210 --> 12:33.878
and Wu‐Tang can do
for this label

12:33.878 --> 12:35.922
what Elvis did in 1956,

12:35.922 --> 12:38.633
and don't you wanna be
on the right side of history?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.971
‐ The answer's no.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.694
What the fuck
is this shit, man?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.612
Yo, Ma.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.364
No.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.824
Come on, man.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.288
Yo, man.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.127
What's going on?

13:15.586 --> 13:17.714
‐ Um,

13:17.714 --> 13:19.257
I fell behind on the rent.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.719
‐ Why wouldn't you
tell me that?

13:24.095 --> 13:28.433
‐ Because I‐‐I didn't want you
to go back into those streets.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.144
I'm really sorry.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.813
Just wish
I had gotten my Bible.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.815
Your grandmother gave it to me.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.859
The neighbors offered for us
to stay with them

13:37.859 --> 13:39.610
until we can figure out
where to go.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.363
Come inside.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.620
Where you going?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.165
‐ To get our spot back.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.211
Yo, yo.
What up, Sha?

13:57.211 --> 13:59.005
‐ I'm tired of this shit, man.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.256
‐ Yo, you good?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.675
One second, you on
the straight and narrow.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.802
You doing
what you supposed to do.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.638
Next second, you getting kicked
out your fucking crib

14:07.638 --> 14:11.225
for being poor, Black,
and in the fucking hood, man.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.436
The fuck is we supposed
to do, man?

14:13.436 --> 14:15.772
It's like no matter
what you do,

14:15.772 --> 14:17.231
no matter where you go,

14:17.231 --> 14:19.901
shit's always gonna be fucking
stacked against you, man.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.530
We gotta get our families
out this shit, son.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.907
We gotta migrate.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.658
Yup.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.285
‐ Shit is fucking crazy, man.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.163
‐ Yo, son, it's always
about the money, yo,

14:32.163 --> 14:33.873
know what I mean?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.084
But don't get stagnated
in that shit,

14:36.084 --> 14:37.543
you know what I'm saying?

14:37.543 --> 14:38.920
You gotta do what you do,

14:38.920 --> 14:41.422
take the same energy
you got going on right now,

14:41.422 --> 14:45.051
take that shit, and put
that shit in the booth, nigga,

14:45.051 --> 14:46.719
you know I'm saying?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.346
Yo, you heard Deck's verse?

14:48.346 --> 14:50.973
Yo, put that shit on, son.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.604
Yo, listen to this shit, nigga.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.211
Babe, you made the lemonade?

15:20.211 --> 15:21.629
‐ Doing it right now.

15:24.882 --> 15:28.386
‐ Hey, um, I got that.
Come here.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.887
‐ I'm just about done.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.848
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I got it. I got it. You know.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.517
You know Mama taught me
how to make some lemonade.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.853
Well, thanks
for saving me the extra swirls.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.151
I know
it hasn't been...ideal

15:43.151 --> 15:45.570
living here with me and Nia,

15:45.570 --> 15:47.780
but it's been nice having you.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.657
You know, you and‐‐
you and the baby.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.826
D, not so much.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.497
Yeah.
It's been nice.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.180
‐ Congratulations, Divine.
Passed your piss test.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.226
‐ Come on in, Officer.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.355
‐ Tell me what's going on
with the job search.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.982
Your file shows
that your construction job

16:22.982 --> 16:24.150
ended a while ago.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.068
‐ Well, actually, sir,
I've, uh‐‐

16:26.068 --> 16:27.069
‐ Thank you.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.905
‐ I've been punching my clock

16:28.905 --> 16:30.448
with a new venture.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.326
There you go.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.287
‐ Okay.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.414
Where's your pay stub?

16:38.414 --> 16:41.292
‐ Uh, with all due respect,
sir, what do you mean?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.169
I've‐‐I've been working harder

16:43.169 --> 16:45.796
than I ever had
in my entire life.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.674
My‐‐my sister,
yeah, she will tell you.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.301
Come on, Divine.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.928
Every ex‐con tells me
they're in the rap game.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.346
That's not a job.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.098
You need a W‐4 to prove
you have a real job,

16:56.098 --> 16:57.600
or I'll be forced
to violate you,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.185
and then they'll send you back.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.025
Mmm.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.693
Uh, who made the lemonade?
It's great.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.320
I did.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.576
‐ You're lucky
he didn't fire us.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.994
‐ How the fuck are we supposed
to do this

17:16.994 --> 17:18.454
when our whole budget
is peanuts?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.665
‐ Maybe I can start
going to temple again.

17:20.665 --> 17:24.919
‐ Hey, guys,
nice work back there.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.462
Thanks, Mojoe.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.257
‐ Sorry it was a no‐go.
You going to the BMG retreat?

17:29.257 --> 17:31.259
‐ For what?
Whole company's going.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.969
All of BMG's subsidiaries.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.345
Even BMG's CEO,

17:34.345 --> 17:36.097
Christoph Rainer,
will be there.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.391
Maybe he'll appreciate
your passion for Wu‐Tang.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.941
It is what it is,
know what I mean?

17:46.941 --> 17:48.025
‐ Come on, man.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.485
I came at it raw.
‐ Hey, yo.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.363
‐ Hey, yo.
Sharpened my sword, man.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.489
Oh, word?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.449
‐ Wrote a new rhyme
for "Lifestyle."

17:55.449 --> 17:57.952
‐ Me and Rae's verse
together?

17:57.952 --> 17:58.995
Whoo!

17:58.995 --> 18:00.496
‐ Word.
Let's hear it.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.291
‐ Hey, yo.
Lay that down, God.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.501
- Yo, what's up, man?
- Soo!

18:05.501 --> 18:07.253
‐ Come on, son, I can't even
hear anything, man.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171
Turn up the fucking music, God.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.086
‐ Yo. I told you.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.297
No distractions, yo.
What's up?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.299
‐ And I told you
stop coming at me like that.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.508
Damn.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.010
‐ Do you know Dennis
ain't even in there?

18:56.010 --> 18:57.303
‐ That's why I came.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.933
Money's been kind of tight,
and I'm just nervous

19:02.933 --> 19:06.187
that he's gonna fall back
into his old ways.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.313
I mean, I don't know,

19:07.313 --> 19:09.523
but that's the vibe
I'm getting.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.693
‐ Oh.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.075
Hey, 'Rie, uh, I'm sorry
that no one is making

19:19.075 --> 19:20.201
any money right now, but‐‐

19:20.201 --> 19:21.869
‐ I get it, Bobby.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.412
‐ Hey.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.500
We gonna get a deal soon.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.352
I can honestly say
that there's just

19:46.352 --> 19:48.062
no other group like Wu‐Tang
out there.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.815
You guys are at the vanguard
of your own movement,

19:50.815 --> 19:52.733
and we at Elektra,
we want‐‐no,

19:52.733 --> 19:56.153
we need to be
a part of that movement.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.656
Wu‐Tang's album
has to be out on Elektra.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.449
‐ Will you guarantee
an album release?

20:00.449 --> 20:01.742
‐ Absolutely.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.661
I'll put that in writing
if that puts you at ease.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.915
‐ All right.
‐ Yeah.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.375
We knew you'd be on board.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.502
And listen, we‐‐
we don't mess with the music.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.129
We don't do that
to our artists.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.338
That's what you do.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.716
What we do is marketing,
and image is key.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.844
So with you guys, we'll have
to discuss the presentation.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.888
We want you to be street
but not too street.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.057
And maybe give you
a more unifying look.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.517
‐ Unifying look?

20:26.517 --> 20:28.310
‐ Yeah.
Maybe some dancers.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.688
‐ I mean, with us, what you see
is what you get.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.273
Mm‐hmm.
‐ You know?

20:32.273 --> 20:33.441
‐ Yeah.
Fuck that.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.650
‐ We just keep it real.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.902
What do you mean
by "keep it real"?

20:38.028 --> 20:40.448
Is this table not real?

20:40.448 --> 20:41.574
Is this office not real?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.535
Come on.
Look, guys.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.495
Like I said, we're not trying
to change your music,

20:46.495 --> 20:47.955
and we don't wanna change
who you are.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.623
We wanna preserve
your authenticity.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.875
And matter of fact,

20:50.875 --> 20:52.626
we want you to be
the biggest rap group

20:52.626 --> 20:54.587
in the game.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.380
Is that not what you all want?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.219
To show you how serious we are,

21:02.219 --> 21:05.264
we're prepared to offer you
$200,000 to sign with us.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.683
‐ How soon can we get that
to the rest of our crew?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.518
‐ If you sign today,

21:09.518 --> 21:10.811
you'll have a check
before you leave.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.397
‐ That's a solid offer,
but we need to discuss

21:13.397 --> 21:15.566
this whole image things
amongst ourselves.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.151
‐ I understand.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.861
Your shoes, they're nice.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.279
Jordans.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.574
The hood loves Jordans.
You know who else does?

21:23.574 --> 21:25.534
Middle America.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.621
If you think I'm asking you
to sell out, ask yourself,

21:28.621 --> 21:30.539
is Michael Jordan a sellout?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.876
The answer is hell no.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.252
He makes more money
selling shoes

21:35.252 --> 21:36.837
than he does
playing basketball

21:36.837 --> 21:39.006
because he presents
a certain image.

21:39.006 --> 21:43.177
He's cool, he's authentic,
but he's not threatening.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.013
‐ Nigga, yo, what the fuck?

21:46.013 --> 21:47.932
Yo, we thought a hundred thou
was a lot, yo.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.476
They just came out
with 200 thou, son.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.102
200.
Yeah, but okay, look.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.437
Listen.
‐ Come on, son.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.730
‐ He wants to change Bobby
and the team's image.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.856
We can't do that.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.024
‐ No, no, no,
that's not what he said.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.192
What'd he say?

21:58.192 --> 21:59.235
He doesn't want him
to sell out.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.569
He wants the albums
to sell out.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.779
- That's not what he‐‐
- Come on, son.

22:01.779 --> 22:05.157
You heard him, right, RZA?
Yo, RZ.

22:12.081 --> 22:16.126
$200,000?

22:16.126 --> 22:17.378
Yo, just imagine

22:17.378 --> 22:19.296
what you and your boys
could do with that shit.

22:22.842 --> 22:27.012
‐ Yeah, till they start
telling you how to dress.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.681
‐ Damn.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.642
Yo, this would have
been way easier to put on

22:31.642 --> 22:33.435
with $200,000 in the bank.

22:35.396 --> 22:38.232
Shit.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.589
Shit.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.841
Well, sometimes

23:03.841 --> 23:05.968
you gotta sacrifice
some pieces to get that meat.

23:05.968 --> 23:09.013
‐ Oh, that's how you wanna
play, motherfucker?

23:09.013 --> 23:11.056
You look like one of the pieces
on the board.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.232
You gotta take care
of that back rank.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.361
Checkmate, Prince Rakeem.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.196
‐ Oh, fuck, man.

23:41.086 --> 23:45.549
‐ You know, sacrificing
without thinking too far ahead,

23:45.549 --> 23:47.593
you're gonna risk everything.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.471
It all depends on what you
sacrifice and win.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.807
Dovetail mate.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.560
‐ Yeah. I don't know.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.189
I mean, maybe you're just
too smart for your own good.

24:01.440 --> 24:07.237
It's 200K for the whole team.
Shit.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.573
Yo, think about what Dennis
and Shurrie can do with that.

24:09.573 --> 24:13.535
‐ I have.
I've thought of it all.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.163
‐ Yeah.
You sure?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.752
‐ We don't want you
to just sell gold.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.129
We want you to sell millions.

24:26.256 --> 24:29.051
‐ So in terms of marketing
Wu‐Tang's image, we can‐‐

24:29.051 --> 24:31.595
‐ Look, we love Wu‐Tang
just the way you are.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.056
Gritty, grimy, real.

24:34.056 --> 24:37.142
Def Jam stands for black
and white and shades of gray.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.769
We don't want any
of that shiny shit here

24:38.769 --> 24:40.312
if it isn't platinum.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.189
All right.
All right.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.817
I like how that sounds, so how
would you roll out the album?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.860
‐ I'm glad you asked, Power.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.781
So I've talked to my team,
and we plan on releasing

24:50.781 --> 24:53.492
a Wu‐Tang album
in the fourth quarter.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.119
‐ That's the biggest quarter.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.912
‐ Shows you how much
we believe in you guys.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.163
Word.
‐ And we've already mapped out

24:58.163 --> 24:59.873
plans for ODB and Meth,

24:59.873 --> 25:01.291
two of my personal faves.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.543
We see them as solo artists

25:02.543 --> 25:04.878
and plan on putting albums out
on them as well.

25:04.878 --> 25:08.424
‐ So when would Def Jam
want to put out Meth's album?

25:08.424 --> 25:10.384
‐ The target would be
probably next summer.

25:10.384 --> 25:12.928
We don't want Meth stepping
on Wu‐Tang, and vice‐versa.

25:12.928 --> 25:16.765
‐ That's if Meth is on Def Jam.

25:16.765 --> 25:20.811
‐ If Wu‐Tang is on Def Jam,
then Meth is on Def Jam.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.813
If we're utilizing
our time and resources

25:22.813 --> 25:24.565
to make each one
of the guys a star,

25:24.565 --> 25:26.567
then Def Jam
should also benefit

25:26.567 --> 25:28.902
by putting out
their projects as well.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.992
As businessmen,
it's to my understanding

25:34.992 --> 25:37.911
that all of the guys are signed
to Wu‐Tang Productions.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.538
So if all of the guys
are signed to you,

25:39.538 --> 25:41.123
why wouldn't it be the same
for us?

25:41.123 --> 25:43.042
It's just
a standard business practice.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.585
Right, fellas?
Uh, yes, it is.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.421
Obviously, we are very,
very interested in your offer.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.256
Hold up.
We didn't come here

25:49.256 --> 25:52.760
for no standard business
practices, all right?

25:52.760 --> 25:54.219
Bottom line,

25:54.219 --> 25:58.098
if you sign Wu‐Tang,
you get them as a group.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.225
You don't get them
as solo artists.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.061
Period.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.900
‐ Yo, what the fuck happened
in there, yo? Huh?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.610
You spring that shit
without talking to us first?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.153
‐ Hey, hey.
Come on, Bobby.

26:11.153 --> 26:15.032
‐ Look, I'm not just working
on shit for Wu‐Tang, all right?

26:15.032 --> 26:17.326
I'm working on shit
for all the guys,

26:17.326 --> 26:20.704
on some
take‐over‐the‐world type shit.

26:20.704 --> 26:24.541
The solo rights belong
to Wu‐Tang Productions.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.294
We cannot give them to Def Jam.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.963
Wu‐Tang Productions
has gotta call all the shots

26:29.963 --> 26:31.590
and protect the solo artist.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.258
‐ Yo, you thinking
about solo artists.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.969
That's great, but how about you
try thinking about the group,

26:35.969 --> 26:37.387
know what I mean?

26:37.387 --> 26:40.390
Okay, and just try to let us
into that head of yours

26:40.390 --> 26:42.601
so, you know, we're not in
there looking like dumbasses.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.978
‐ Yeah. Come on, Bobby.
Talk to us. What's going on?

26:44.978 --> 26:47.731
‐ If they wanna send us out,
out of the same spout,

26:47.731 --> 26:50.192
we can only go one at a time.
Right?

26:50.192 --> 26:53.195
Say Meth's album ain't no hit.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.488
They're not gonna wanna
give us money

26:54.488 --> 26:56.115
for any other solo deals.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.700
Next thing we know, Dirty
ain't got no release date.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.246
We cannot afford to put
all our shit in one spot.

27:02.246 --> 27:03.789
‐ I hear what you saying,
my nigga,

27:03.789 --> 27:05.249
but ain't you jumping the gun,
you know what I'm saying?

27:05.249 --> 27:06.750
We gotta deal
with one thing at a time.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.544
Yo, Sha and his mom
just got evicted, and‐‐

27:08.544 --> 27:09.878
‐ Dude, the full crew is broke.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.046
‐ Yo, ain't gotta
fucking talk to me

27:11.046 --> 27:12.464
about that shit, all right?

27:14.216 --> 27:17.928
Look, if we
wanna win this game,

27:17.928 --> 27:20.597
we gotta play
on multiple boards,

27:20.597 --> 27:25.060
doubling down,
and knowing when to strike.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.569
‐ That's your brother.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.578
the park

27:46.373 --> 27:48.750
‐ Thanks for coming by.
Have a seat.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.379
‐ I'm not staying long, yo.
I gotta get back to the studio.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.632
‐ Okay, yeah. No. Sure.
I'll get right to it, then.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.843
So look, the parent company
to Loud, BMG,

27:57.843 --> 27:59.303
is having
their corporate retreat

27:59.303 --> 28:02.931
in Connecticut this week,
and I want Wu‐Tang to perform.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.391
‐ Why?

28:04.391 --> 28:06.935
‐ RZA, what are you
looking for, man?

28:06.935 --> 28:09.021
In terms of a deal.
You said you wanted freedom.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.398
I said you'll have complete
creative freedom at Loud.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.986
‐ Not just creative.
Business too.

28:15.986 --> 28:17.905
‐ Meaning?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.657
‐ Look, signing Wu‐Tang
is one thing,

28:20.657 --> 28:23.785
but I want my brothers
to have the freedom to go out

28:23.785 --> 28:29.541
and get their own solo deals,
you know, make their own money.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.668
Now, I know that's not
industry standard.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.003
‐ Yeah, but Wu‐Tang's

28:33.003 --> 28:34.838
not industry standard
either, right?

28:34.838 --> 28:37.174
So I'm not gonna give you
that same boilerplate shit.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.175
I'll give you what you want,

28:38.175 --> 28:39.885
freedom for your guys,
all that.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.472
‐ Word?

28:43.472 --> 28:44.973
‐ But what I can't give you
is the kind of money

28:44.973 --> 28:46.475
you'll get
from those other guys.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.226
I mean, I want to.
I‐‐I just don't have it yet.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.853
Not‐‐not right now.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.772
‐ Yo.

28:51.772 --> 28:56.234
Yo, my guys are‐‐yo,
we hurting right now, Steve.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.445
Like, straight up.

28:58.445 --> 29:01.239
I can't afford
to‐‐to hold out any longer.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.866
‐ That's why I want you
to perform for my bosses.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.035
I just want them to see
how special you guys are,

29:05.035 --> 29:06.912
and then I can
get you everything.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.212
You know
what I'm saying?

29:15.212 --> 29:16.672
No, son. No.

29:16.672 --> 29:19.257
It's not about going back.
It's about staying afloat.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.759
Niggas are still
in the studio.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.678
That don't mean I'm not
gonna take a nigga chain.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.763
God...

29:24.763 --> 29:27.349
‐ Hey, yo.
You seen Ghost?

29:27.349 --> 29:28.642
‐ He was here a minute ago,
but then he said

29:28.642 --> 29:30.352
he had some business
he had to take care of.

29:32.562 --> 29:34.022
If the labels found out
about that‐‐

29:34.022 --> 29:35.440
I ain't scared
about no label.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.483
This shit ain't‐‐
Yeah, but they the ones

29:36.483 --> 29:37.859
giving the deal, nigga.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.070
‐ Come on, know what I mean?
What about these bills?

29:40.070 --> 29:42.114
‐ Yo, what the fuck?

29:42.114 --> 29:43.281
What are you doing, man?

29:43.281 --> 29:44.700
U‐
Don't come into the studio.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.202
I told you to page me
if you needed me, nigga.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.997
If.
Give me the fucking bag.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.716
‐ Everybody, check this out,
all right?

30:18.025 --> 30:19.860
‐ This shit needs a‐‐

30:19.860 --> 30:21.403
needs a hook or something,
you know what I'm saying?

30:21.403 --> 30:23.780
‐ Well, "Protect Ya Neck"
ain't have no hook.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.115
‐ But this shit's different.

30:25.115 --> 30:27.617
I'm feeling like this shit
actually needs that shit.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.161
- Yo, yo.
- Yo.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.121
Right on time, yo.
‐ What's up? What up?

30:31.121 --> 30:32.873
‐ Peace.
‐ It's good.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.332
‐ What up, man?
Damn.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.792
‐ Need a chorus, yo.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.377
You be having
all them one‐liners.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.087
We need some, uh,‐‐
some melodic shit for this,

30:39.087 --> 30:41.590
you know what I'm saying?
‐ No doubt.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.175
Shit right here.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.885
Yeah.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.963
Yeah.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.216
Soo!

31:28.011 --> 31:29.471
‐ All right.
‐ Cash rules...

31:29.471 --> 31:30.806
Everything around me.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.146
That's my man
Raider Ruckus right there,

31:38.146 --> 31:39.189
know what I mean?

31:39.189 --> 31:41.441
‐ Word. Word.
‐ Word.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.276
C.R.E.A.M. get the money.

31:43.276 --> 31:46.196
‐ Yo. Yo, where the fuck
you been at, nigga?

31:46.196 --> 31:48.198
‐ Nowhere, nowhere.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.158
‐ Yo, shit is‐‐

31:50.158 --> 31:52.035
shit is going good, all right?

31:52.035 --> 31:55.664
Yo, we‐‐we just gotta hold on,
you know what I'm saying?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.625
‐ Hell, unless you paying
my bills and shit,

31:58.625 --> 32:00.127
that's a lot easier said
than done,

32:00.127 --> 32:02.087
know what I mean?

32:02.087 --> 32:04.047
Yeah, what up
with the deal, son?

32:04.047 --> 32:06.716
That shit came through yet
or‐‐or what?

32:06.716 --> 32:09.261
‐ Man, we got a‐‐

32:09.261 --> 32:12.973
we got another‐‐
another label meeting.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.641
Just one more.

32:14.641 --> 32:19.479
It's kind of like a showcase,
and all of us gotta be there.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.897
‐ Wait, wait, wait.
Says who, huh?

32:20.897 --> 32:22.107
Yo, you agreed to it
already?

32:22.107 --> 32:23.441
Hey, yo, we getting paid, son?

32:23.441 --> 32:24.901
We better be getting paid.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.903
‐ If we ain't getting paid,
it ain't making sense, guy.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.280
Nigga, what's going on?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.281
‐ Hey, yo.
Yo, yo, look.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.740
All of y'all know

32:30.740 --> 32:33.368
that each label has
their own process, a'ight?

32:33.368 --> 32:35.745
Son, I'm not about to keep
going through this, son.

32:35.745 --> 32:39.749
‐ I'm just asking y'all
for one night.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.383
‐ What's up, fellas?
This is gonna be great.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.093
Yo, the whole company's here.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.970
They're excited
to see you guys.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.223
‐ Yo, this shit
better be worth it.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.406
‐ Christoph.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.658
Hey, this is
the, uh, Wu‐Tang Clan,

33:13.658 --> 33:15.118
the group I was telling you
about.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.578
They're gonna be huge stars.

33:16.578 --> 33:20.790
Guys, this is Christoph Rainer.
He's the head of RCA.

33:20.790 --> 33:24.044
‐ I'm very interested
in hearing you perform.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.338
I'm a big fan of R&amp;B.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.631
‐ Oh, this ain't no...

33:27.631 --> 33:28.798
‐ We'll let you get back
to business.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.342
‐ R&amp;B.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.844
‐ 'Cause the guys need
to get ready.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.971
Good to see you.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.474
‐ Hey, hey, uh,

33:37.474 --> 33:39.684
you sure these guys know
what we got going on here?

33:39.684 --> 33:42.312
'Cause we ain't on
no R&amp;B shit, yo.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.980
‐ Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.273
It's gonna be great.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.943
Come on.
It's gonna be great.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.486
‐ I'm gonna need one more
cheers for the night, yo.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.029
Put your pinkie out
when you drink.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.948
‐ Yo, yo.

33:52.948 --> 33:58.453
We're, uh,
the Wu‐Tang Clan, and‐‐

33:58.453 --> 34:00.997
‐ Hey, yo.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.458
Coming straight
from the Shaolin land

34:03.458 --> 34:06.211
and the Brooklyn Zoo.

34:06.211 --> 34:10.090
Introducing the Wu‐Tang Clan.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.633
Soo!

34:13.301 --> 34:16.888
‐ Yeah. All right, cousin.
Let's go, kid.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.265
‐ Hey, yo, what's up?

34:18.265 --> 34:21.142
German niggas
don't like hip‐hop?

34:21.142 --> 34:23.478
‐ Man, these cats have no idea
what's about to go down.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.340
I always wanted to do that.
Word.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.009
‐ All right. All right.
All right. All right.

34:54.009 --> 34:57.262
Yo, everybody
put your hands together.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.723
Meth, yo.
Kick that shit, yo.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.121
‐ Hey, yo, uh,
I've been meaning to ask, man.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.165
How's everything been,
you know, uh, money‐wise?

35:25.165 --> 35:26.207
‐ Oh, shit.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.959
You know
the messenger job pays good.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.003
I ain't tripping.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.338
‐ I mean, it's just that,
you know, you haven't been

35:31.338 --> 35:34.007
asking about any
of the label meetings or...

35:34.007 --> 35:35.842
You know, just wanted to‐‐

35:35.842 --> 35:38.219
‐ Bobby, we've been
here before.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.138
We know what it's like
to starve,

35:40.138 --> 35:41.681
and we know what it's like
to eat steak,

35:41.681 --> 35:43.892
know what I mean?

35:43.892 --> 35:45.435
‐ Hey, it's gonna be different
this time.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.645
It's gotta be.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.147
Yo, yo.
Yo, how was that shit?

35:49.147 --> 35:51.232
‐ They loved you guys.
Word?

35:51.232 --> 35:53.026
‐ Like, loved you guys.
Obviously.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.986
Yo.
‐ Yeah. Next level.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.863
Never seen
anything like it before.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.740
I'm gonna iron out the details
with Christoph,

35:58.740 --> 36:00.075
but everything's great.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.035
I gotta talk shop
with 'Vine and Power,

36:02.035 --> 36:03.953
but there's one thing
I need you guys to do.

36:03.953 --> 36:08.917
If you could have fun tonight
with the boys, okay?

36:18.343 --> 36:20.470
‐ Whoo!

36:24.808 --> 36:26.935
‐ Oh, word.
Word.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.978
All right, let me see this.
What's this?

36:28.978 --> 36:32.399
Yo, okay.
Hey, yo, where you going, son?

36:32.399 --> 36:33.650
‐ I ate something foul. Shit.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.984
‐ Oh, man.
How you gonna be sick

36:34.984 --> 36:36.611
on a night like this, huh?

36:36.611 --> 36:38.863
On a night like this, y'all.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.412
‐ Ahh!

37:34.377 --> 37:36.004
‐ Kill y'all son of...

37:46.598 --> 37:48.641
‐ Yo, we just ate
that nigga, fool.

37:50.435 --> 37:51.895
Where the party at, man?

37:51.895 --> 37:53.855
‐ Hey, yo, God.
We need more Method.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.982
Know I'm saying?
‐ I got you.

37:55.982 --> 37:59.778
‐ Oh!
‐ Ladies, step aside.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.946
Fuck is wrong with you?

38:01.946 --> 38:03.823
Fucking with my sleep.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.575
Waking me up.
Stupid.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.998
‐ Fuck.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.375
Damn, son.
‐ Yo.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.544
Them motherfuckers
play too much.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.881
‐ Yo, what the fuck, nigga?

38:21.174 --> 38:23.426
Well, I've been meaning
to ask you, yo.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.720
I thought you were stepping
away from that street shit.

38:25.720 --> 38:29.682
‐ I'm just dabbling, yo.
Yo, it ain't shit, all right?

38:29.682 --> 38:32.060
I still gotta get that cream.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.353
‐ Yeah.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.731
Yeah, I feel it.

38:39.734 --> 38:44.489
But yo, the music...
it's a priority.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.698
‐ I get what you saying,

38:45.698 --> 38:48.159
but my priority is making sure

38:48.159 --> 38:50.161
there's food on the table.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.872
Yo, that music shit ain't doing
nothing for me right now.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.460
‐ Remember, we have
that plan, yo.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.796
‐ Yeah. A five‐year plan.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.589
‐ Which you agreed to, yo.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.259
‐ Well, I ain't agree
to starve, though.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.970
Yo, I gotta eat, son.

39:06.970 --> 39:10.139
Fuck that.
We all do.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.808
‐ You need to choose.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.988
Soo!

39:43.339 --> 39:45.633
Police!
Get your hands up.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.427
Get your fucking hands up.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.178
Turn around slowly.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.439
Steve,
what are these charges?

39:59.439 --> 40:00.815
Can you explain this to me?

40:00.815 --> 40:02.275
What do you want me
to say?

40:02.275 --> 40:04.068
I have never seen
anything like this before.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.320
It's a‐‐

40:05.320 --> 40:07.238
My artists
don't do these things.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.661
‐ I don't know
what you're saying.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.581
‐ You're lucky the hotel isn't
pressing charges for vandalism.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.625
Okay, I told you they're
not just rappers, right?

40:18.625 --> 40:20.793
They're like the Beatles
or the Rolling Stones.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.503
Yeah,
they're fucking rock stars.

40:22.503 --> 40:23.796
You don't get it, right?

40:25.089 --> 40:26.799
That's how they're
supposed to behave.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.176
I signed you to a deal,

40:28.176 --> 40:29.844
and you can do what you want,

40:29.844 --> 40:31.804
but your budget is your budget,

40:31.804 --> 40:34.474
and I'm not
giving you another dime,

40:34.474 --> 40:38.019
especially after what I just
spent on their mess upstairs.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.729
Mm‐hmm.
Hey.

40:39.729 --> 40:42.565
Listen, I didn't mean
for you to hear that guy.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.943
You know, he's just‐‐
‐ Yo, it's‐‐it's all good.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.319
Yeah.
He's just an emotional‐‐

40:46.319 --> 40:47.445
‐ I don't wanna interrupt,

40:47.445 --> 40:49.489
but U‐God
just got arrested last night.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.880
‐ You just missed him.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.435
What's that?

41:19.435 --> 41:22.563
‐ Buy yourself something nice.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.443
Where'd you get that?

41:28.778 --> 41:32.031
‐ Hey, yo,
I got you

41:32.031 --> 41:35.410
and Infinite, all right?

41:35.410 --> 41:37.203
‐ Dennis...

41:49.966 --> 41:51.718
‐ You don't never gotta worry.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.930
Come here.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.026
‐ Yo, come on, yo.
60 Gs?

42:08.026 --> 42:10.862
Yo, son. I can make 60 Gs
in my sleep, nigga.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.655
That don't even cover
what I spent so far.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.949
We gave 'em what they wanted.
We did our part.

42:14.949 --> 42:17.285
We gave them
the little horse‐and‐pony show.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.787
Now they wanna lowball us?
That's fucking bullshit.

42:19.787 --> 42:22.123
‐ Yo, cash rules everything
around me,

42:22.123 --> 42:23.875
but that shit
don't rule me, yo.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.043
‐ I hear all of that.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.045
I heard
all of that shit, nigga.

42:27.045 --> 42:30.173
I'm just saying the difference
between what Loud is offering

42:30.173 --> 42:32.467
and the 200
that Elektra's giving?

42:32.467 --> 42:33.801
Come on.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.219
‐ Yeah, well, you know,
there's no more offer

42:35.219 --> 42:36.637
from Elektra anymore.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.598
‐ What you mean?
What happened?

42:38.598 --> 42:39.932
‐ I don't know
how they found out

42:39.932 --> 42:41.809
about the hotel room
getting trashed,

42:41.809 --> 42:43.853
but they also know about U‐God
getting arrested too,

42:43.853 --> 42:46.064
so they pulled the offer.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.816
They already had an issue
with our image, so, you know...

42:48.816 --> 42:50.651
they out.
‐ Come on, come on.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.445
Why they tripping off of that?

42:52.445 --> 42:56.157
‐ Elektra is owned
by Warner Brothers.

42:56.157 --> 42:59.786
Warner Brothers is
a publicly traded company.

42:59.786 --> 43:01.704
‐ All right, so look, boom.

43:01.704 --> 43:04.165
We still got Def Jam
on the table, right?

43:04.165 --> 43:07.752
‐ Yeah, but, you know, they can
also pull they offer too.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.712
We have to make a decision.

43:26.395 --> 43:30.024
‐ Hey.
Think carefully, RZA.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.359
You don't wanna play yourself,

43:31.359 --> 43:34.487
or maybe you already have.

43:35.113 --> 43:39.909
‐ Damn.
200K down the gutter.

43:41.452 --> 43:45.665
That ain't no short money,
player, not at all.

43:45.665 --> 43:49.961
‐ You only saying that 'cause
you ain't got no strategy.

43:49.961 --> 43:52.338
No vision.

43:52.338 --> 43:53.923
You're too scared
to play the game.

43:58.261 --> 44:00.513
Checkmate.

44:00.513 --> 44:01.973
‐ All right.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.934
Well, you may have beat me,
but did you really win?

44:04.934 --> 44:06.686
‐ Fucking sellout, yo.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.563
‐ Oh, shit.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.152
Ah, yo.

44:18.948 --> 44:20.658
‐ I don't really know
how to play.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.243
Can you teach me?

44:22.243 --> 44:24.495
‐ Hey.

44:26.998 --> 44:31.127
All right,
so when you start a game,

44:31.127 --> 44:34.839
you never wanna show fear,
ever.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.967
The way you start
determines how you finish.

44:37.967 --> 44:41.179
You wanna step
into your bravery,

44:41.179 --> 44:43.973
even if that means
being scared.

44:43.973 --> 44:46.809
We gotta think
about the future.

44:46.809 --> 44:51.397
We want Wu‐Tang to be forever.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.275
You get it?

44:55.568 --> 44:57.028
‐ I think so.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.531
What do I do next?

45:17.757 --> 45:20.134
‐ Know what I mean?
I was cozy and all that shit.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.677
I was in my slippers
and all that.

45:21.677 --> 45:23.429
You was there,
know what I mean?

45:26.140 --> 45:28.684
‐ Yo, RZA, what's up, man?

45:28.684 --> 45:30.561
‐ Hey.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.772
‐ We just signed at Loud.

45:32.772 --> 45:34.148
Wait,
you just fucking what?

46:03.844 --> 46:05.972
‐ Where y'all going?

46:59.066 --> 47:00.568
Get on the line.
