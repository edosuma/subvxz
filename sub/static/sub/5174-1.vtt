phase two of our evil project.

49:30.269 --> 49:32.938
Or is it phase...? I don't know phases.

49:33.106 --> 49:38.777
Anyways, this is the phase in which
we put a giant "laser" on the moon.

49:38.945 --> 49:43.699
As you know, the moon rotates
around the Earth, like so:

49:49.789 --> 49:53.625
When the moon reaches
its appropriate lunar alignment...

49:53.793 --> 49:56.628
...it will destroy Washington, D.C.

49:57.130 --> 50:01.550
You see, I've turned the moon
into what I like to call...

50:01.718 --> 50:03.927
...a "death star."

50:15.107 --> 50:17.900
Anyways, the key to this plan
is the giant laser.

50:18.068 --> 50:21.904
It was invented by the noted
Cambridge physicist Dr. Parsons.

50:22.072 --> 50:26.701
Therefore we shall call it
"the Alan Parsons Project."

"Operation Wang Chung," ass.

will be huge.
