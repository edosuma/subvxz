WEBVTT

00:09.270 --> 00:10.227
What time is it?

00:10.271 --> 00:11.576
7:59.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.926
So, in one minute,
we're off duty,

00:13.970 --> 00:16.103
and yet Central
gives us this job.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.888
Really? There was
no one else available?

00:18.931 --> 00:21.673
Just admit it. You want to see
Jamie at change of tour.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.067
Well, we are newlyweds,

00:24.111 --> 00:26.069
we still like each other.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.028
Maybe our new boss will
show us some sympathy

00:28.071 --> 00:29.159
and cut us loose.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.205
Morning, boss.
What do we got?

00:31.248 --> 00:34.208
Neighborhood pool turned
into a watery grave overnight.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.557
Female Hispanic,

00:35.600 --> 00:36.993
early 20s, looks like

00:37.037 --> 00:38.623
blunt force trauma to the head.
Keep the crowd back.

00:38.647 --> 00:39.691
You really need us?

00:39.735 --> 00:40.779
Did I stutter?

00:40.823 --> 00:42.259
No. I just mean...

00:42.303 --> 00:45.045
girls need
their beauty rest, right?

00:45.088 --> 00:46.089
Our tour was almost over.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.873
So was mine.
Now it's not.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.705
Ooh...

00:53.749 --> 00:55.620
All right, folks,
let's get back. Keep it back.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.361
Let's get back here.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.189
Your vic died
of a myocardial infarction.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.713
Neck bruises were from lividity,
not strangulation.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.063
So, no foul play.
Natural causes.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.194
Yeah.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.544
Got to be kidding me.

01:06.588 --> 01:09.112
Well, I guess I'll cut
his brother loose then.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.461
Tell him I accept tips.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.376
Will do.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.117
You okay?

01:14.161 --> 01:17.033
Actually, uh...

01:18.252 --> 01:20.123
That-that couple.Mm-hmm.

01:20.167 --> 01:23.170
When I was here the other day,
they were sitting right there.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.322
They come in every couple
of days, asking about Jane Does.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.130
I show 'em photos of
who I got, they say none

01:27.174 --> 01:28.305
are a match and they leave.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.307
And that doesn't strike you
as strange,

01:30.351 --> 01:32.483
that they're looking
for Jane Does every couple days?

01:32.527 --> 01:35.530
It's the morgue.
Strange is what we do.

01:39.534 --> 01:42.014
Scuse me.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.320
Hey. How you doing?

01:43.364 --> 01:44.756
Actually, I was wondering

01:44.800 --> 01:45.757
how you're doing.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.150
Um, Detective Reagan.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.934
Do you mind if I ask
you a question or two?

01:48.978 --> 01:51.285
Sorry. No English.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.069
That's funny. The doc said

01:53.113 --> 01:55.158
you speak English. We go now.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.918
Look, I just wanted
to ask you a question or two.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.944
Must go! Sorry.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.495
Matt will start the
welcoming remarks,

02:08.519 --> 02:10.259
with Misty and Mindy following,

02:10.304 --> 02:12.915
and then the three of you will
introduce Commissioner Reagan.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.961
Uh, are we supposed
to write what we say?

02:16.005 --> 02:17.180
Well, yeah.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.834
I'm happy to help.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.749
Or, shoot, I can.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.229
I mean, your mom kept me awake

02:22.272 --> 02:25.188
at I don't know how many
rubber-chicken charity dinners

02:25.232 --> 02:26.624
with great stories.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.191
I'd be happy to share some.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.758
That would be great.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.456
We're kind of more public
figures than public speakers.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.284
Commissioner Reagan
is a public figure.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.460
You guys post selfies
with people you don't know

02:36.504 --> 02:38.549
and product endorsements
for stuff you don't use.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.420
Could you just... Oh, I'm sorry,

02:39.463 --> 02:40.484
Mindy, does the truth hurt?

02:40.508 --> 02:41.683
Or you're just jealous.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.424
Let's just keep our eyes
on the prize here.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.687
What prize? BAKER:
What this is all about, honoring

02:45.730 --> 02:47.428
the great New York legacy
of a great

02:47.471 --> 02:48.864
New Yorker. More BS.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.233
Okay, I think we've gone
over everything...

02:50.257 --> 02:51.693
Hold on a second.

02:51.736 --> 02:56.219
Matt, seems like you have
something to share here.

02:56.263 --> 03:00.092
I've tried for months
to get a meeting with you.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.486
That's news to me.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.705
Well, schedules never gelled.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.359
This is all a fraud.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.057
While my mother was telling you
funny stories at dinner,

03:08.100 --> 03:09.972
there were people
all over this city

03:10.015 --> 03:11.645
trying to pull her knife out
of their backs.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.081
Please don't listen
to him. He's just...

03:13.105 --> 03:15.282
No, you might want
to protect yourself here.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.545
Because when the real stories
come out about my mother,

03:17.588 --> 03:20.374
you're gonna look pretty silly
polishing her statue.

03:20.417 --> 03:24.813
I think I knew your mother
pretty well.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.249
A lot of people thought
they did.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.642
They didn't.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.513
I'm done here.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.735
I am so sorry.

03:33.778 --> 03:34.842
That... BAKER:
Under the circumstances,

03:34.866 --> 03:36.303
I need to see you two out
as well.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.871
Sorry.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.878
Oh, boy.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.236
Didn't expect to walk my first
foot post with a sergeant.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.281
Did I screw up already?

03:58.325 --> 04:00.631
Nah, your training
officer banged in sick.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.459
I figured I'd help out.

04:02.503 --> 04:05.984
So, graduated first in your
class at the academy, huh?

04:06.028 --> 04:07.856
I guess so.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.640
Modest, too. You
keep that attitude,

04:09.684 --> 04:11.294
you'll go far in
this department.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.991
What's up with this?

04:14.819 --> 04:15.927
You thinking what I'm thinking?

04:15.951 --> 04:17.430
Yeah, or, uh, maybe
he's the owner.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.302
Uh, follow my lead.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.306
Hey.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.568
Excuse me, sir.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.396
Can you step away from
the vehicle, please?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.311
Hey, it's not what
it looks like.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.941
Put your hands
on the car. No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.203
See, my keys are all screwed up.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.055
Keep your hands where
I can see 'em. Hey!

04:35.840 --> 04:37.407
Roland!

04:38.582 --> 04:40.280
Roland! Roland.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.324
Hey, Roland.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.847
Hey, hey, Roland.
What happened?

04:42.891 --> 04:44.196
Hey, you hit?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.504
10-13. Officer down.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.985
Corner of Harlem River Drive
and 135th Street. I repeat,

04:50.028 --> 04:51.465
I got an officer down.

04:53.510 --> 04:56.339
♪

05:16.054 --> 05:17.380
Pool's closed today. But
my kids need to cool off.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.729
There's another pool
on 126th Street.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.407
And a Y over on Amsterdam.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.974
Hey, Rachel,

05:23.018 --> 05:25.020
your ten o'clock,
that guy in the back,

05:25.063 --> 05:27.109
is he smiling at me?

05:27.152 --> 05:29.416
Yeah.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.200
Now he's smiling at me.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.768
What, is he mocking us?

05:33.811 --> 05:36.771
Or he killed that girl.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.952
Oh. Where you going,
Officer?

05:43.995 --> 05:46.389
I'm just going to tell Detective
Kotcheff there's a guy.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
He's throwing a weird
grin our direction.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.586
So that's how that works now?

05:49.610 --> 05:51.176
You just tack on the name Reagan

05:51.220 --> 05:52.632
and, suddenly, you're running
the crime scene?

05:52.656 --> 05:53.875
What? No.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.572
Boss, she's just trying to help.

05:55.616 --> 05:59.576
Yeah, and I still go by
Janko when I'm on the job.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.838
And I go by chain of command.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.579
So if you have any information

06:02.623 --> 06:04.407
that you need to convey
to the detective,

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
your patrol supervisor does it.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.412
Fine.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.256
Just right over there.
You can see yourself...

06:12.633 --> 06:14.025
Wait.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.550
He's not there anymore.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.378
So there's nothing
to tell anybody?

06:18.421 --> 06:20.554
If there ever really was.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.472
Hey.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.822
How you doing, Roland?

06:27.865 --> 06:30.085
Can't believe I fell on my ass.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.043
Yeah. Well, it happens
to the best of us.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.045
I thought the guy shot me.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.025
Well, let's get you a ride home,
where you can relax.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.356
And we'll start again as soon
as you're back to full duty.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.313
Start again?

06:41.357 --> 06:42.314
Yeah.

06:42.358 --> 06:43.881
Get back on the horse.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.555
But this is only my third
day out of the academy.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.668
What happens next time?
Or the time after that?

06:47.711 --> 06:49.452
We start slow.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.933
And I got your back
every step of the way.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.457
But you were made for this job.
I can see that in you.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.154
You've also seen rookies die,
right?

06:56.198 --> 06:58.461
That's not the point...
That's exactly the point.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.377
It'll be my wife
getting the flag,

07:01.421 --> 07:02.552
not yours.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.338
Mr. Morales,
you've been very helpful.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.906
Exit's the same way
you came in. Thank you.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.561
Hey. Solid lead
in our furniture store murder.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.171
Mm-hmm. Great.

07:13.215 --> 07:15.086
Guess you I.D.'d
the Chinese couple?

07:15.130 --> 07:16.087
Not yet.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.480
Well, then enough already.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.264
Come on. Enough already, you.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.353
I mean, aren't you even
the least bit curious

07:21.397 --> 07:23.007
about the Jane Doe
they're looking for?

07:23.051 --> 07:24.835
Or why the two of
them blew me off?

07:24.879 --> 07:26.489
Well, that I understand.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.621
Very funny.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.449
You know, you're
really hilarious, Baez.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.450
You're chasing your tail.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.494
I'm not chasing my tail.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.322
Something's going on,
and I know it.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.672
Okay, well, here we go.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.587
The credit card used
in the taxicab belonged

07:37.631 --> 07:40.111
to one Jun Xi Chen.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.679
Hmm. Okay, well, run
it through BADS then.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.594
I'm already doing it.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.641
Jun Xi Chen
was collared last year

07:47.684 --> 07:49.227
when he clipped a pedestrian
with the food truck

07:49.251 --> 07:50.600
he owns.
What do you know?

07:50.644 --> 07:51.775
He has a wife.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.516
Wei-Feng Chen.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.693
She was also collared when
she interfered with the arrest.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.521
They collared her
for obstruction.

07:58.565 --> 07:59.522
That's it?

07:59.566 --> 08:00.828
No, that's not it.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.569
There's another Jun Xi Chen.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.354
Appears to be his son.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.703
And what was he collared for?

08:06.747 --> 08:09.576
He wasn't collared for anything.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.534
Because he's...

08:11.578 --> 08:14.189
Officer Jun Xi Chen.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.064
Curious now?

08:21.675 --> 08:23.241
Don't worry, Frank.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.591
I'll get you out of it.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.940
I'm not gonna do that.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.508
If I missed something,
that's on me.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.772
You turn down requests
like this all the time.

08:31.815 --> 08:32.947
What's the big deal?

08:32.990 --> 08:34.731
Mary Jane.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.172
She was funny.
She was beautiful.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.174
She had great legs.

08:43.217 --> 08:46.830
And that's all
you're gonna get out of me.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.702
So she'd do that thing

08:48.745 --> 08:51.487
where she'd touch your hand and
lean in close with the punchline

08:51.531 --> 08:53.620
or the piece of gossip,
and whatever that perfume was

08:53.663 --> 08:56.013
would just go straight
to your head?

08:58.799 --> 09:00.931
Gone too soon.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.412
Coming through.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.979
Long and short of it,

09:05.022 --> 09:06.763
she made a lot of enemies.

09:07.808 --> 09:11.289
Had or made? There a diff?

09:11.333 --> 09:13.509
Well, she inherited the business
from her husband.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.729
Maybe she inherited his enemies.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.600
Boss, I report, you decide.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.864
47 civil suits for
late or nonpayments

09:20.908 --> 09:22.692
to vendors and subcontractors.

09:22.736 --> 09:23.693
Most of them

09:23.737 --> 09:24.694
settled out of court.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.478
A lot of complaints

09:26.522 --> 09:29.220
of workplace abuse and
hostile environment-type stuff.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.309
Again, settled off the record.

09:31.353 --> 09:34.269
But all with Ms. Kaye
being the defendant.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.487
And it turns out

09:35.531 --> 09:39.840
she also cut Matt out
of the will.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.888
Yikes.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.717
And the good?

09:47.761 --> 09:50.807
Not a single welching on
the charitable pledges she made.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.722
And there were tons of 'em.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.116
What's your take on the sisters?

09:55.159 --> 09:56.378
You mean as a woman?

09:56.421 --> 09:58.685
Hey, you said it, not me.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.295
The way they flounced in here,

10:00.338 --> 10:03.646
throwing shade at my shoes and
demanding the Wi-Fi password,

10:03.690 --> 10:06.040
definitely gave me
a mean girl vibe.

10:06.083 --> 10:09.086
Wouldn't be a stretch
that they learned it from Mom.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.699
And the son?

10:12.742 --> 10:15.136
Getting cut out of the will
explains a lot.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.618
But does it mean he's lying
about the way she really was?

10:21.664 --> 10:24.449
"The evil that men do
lives after them;

10:24.493 --> 10:28.889
the good they do is oft interred
with their bones."

10:40.596 --> 10:43.338
Jamie. Shouldn't you be out
policing or something?

10:43.381 --> 10:45.688
I am policing. Even
after me and a rookie

10:45.732 --> 10:47.777
almost got our heads
blown off yesterday. What?

10:47.821 --> 10:49.712
Even worse, prints at the
scene I.D.'d the shooter

10:49.736 --> 10:52.173
as a guy that youchose
not to send to prison.Wait.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.741
Slow down. So you can have time to
come up with an excuse?

10:54.784 --> 10:57.134
No, so I can understand what
the hell you're talking about.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.179
Manny Langston.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.094
Thief, addict, all-around skel.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.487
Got collared six months ago
on drugs and a handgun.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.851
And yet instead
of doing any time,

11:03.880 --> 11:06.056
he cops a diversion
plea, wound up enrolled

11:06.100 --> 11:08.537
in some dumb-ass community-based
vocational crap.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.451
Wow.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.758
Yeah, exactly. No, "wow,"

11:11.801 --> 11:14.456
like you usually support
programs like that.

11:14.499 --> 11:17.546
For first-time offenders.Look...

11:17.589 --> 11:18.982
I didn't make Manny's deal.

11:20.244 --> 11:22.507
Well, now I got a
rookie who's so scared,

11:22.551 --> 11:25.336
he's ready to tank
a promising career.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.556
So we make it right.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.599
How?

11:30.559 --> 11:34.650
I actually might know
how to flush him out.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.267
You sure this is a good idea?

11:43.311 --> 11:46.053
No. But the Chens' address
and phone number was useless,

11:46.096 --> 11:48.055
so what else are we gonna do?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.797
Officer Chen?

11:52.059 --> 11:54.539
Jun Xi Chen?
Detective Reagan.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.846
My partner, Detective
Baez, from the 5-4 squad.

11:56.890 --> 12:00.241
Hey. Uh, and actually,
I go by Andy.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.591
My partner, Wendy Chu. Nice to meet you.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.679
Andy, we need your help.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.463
We're trying to
locate your parents.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.465
What's wrong? BAEZ:
Nothing.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.467
Just a few questions
about their food truck.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.382
Then you've got the wrong guy.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.602
They disowned me
three years ago.

12:13.645 --> 12:14.646
Really?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.126
Moment I got this shield.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.562
There's a saying in China,

12:17.606 --> 12:19.608
and a lot of parents
brought it here with them.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.436
"No good son become a cop."

12:21.479 --> 12:23.177
My parents came in '85,

12:23.220 --> 12:24.787
and they love this country,

12:24.831 --> 12:27.137
but the old ways make them
suspicious of authority.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.072
I tried convincing them
that police here are different,

12:29.096 --> 12:30.924
but they just cut me off.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.664
Made my sister
stop talking to me, too.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.275
You have a sister?

12:34.318 --> 12:36.451
Jill. Used to be
really close growing up

12:36.494 --> 12:38.801
until they put a wedge
between us.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.456
Hell, I wasn't even invited to
Jill's wedding six months ago.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.414
I see.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.809
What? Did something
happen to her?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.637
No. Uh, actually,

12:48.680 --> 12:51.074
we really should talk
to your parents first.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.946
Neither them or Jill
take my calls anymore.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.920
Do you need me to
sit in on this one?

13:10.964 --> 13:14.750
I would like you to, but don't.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.246
Not my sisters?

13:32.289 --> 13:33.813
Well, unless I misunderstood,

13:33.856 --> 13:35.640
you were trying to get
a meeting with me,

13:35.684 --> 13:38.556
so here we are. Sit down.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.565
So, go.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.742
It's not like I want to do this.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.570
Somebody holding a gun
to your head?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.137
My conscience is.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.747
A fully funded charity

13:55.791 --> 13:58.663
that gives good food and basics

13:58.707 --> 14:01.928
to the poor, homeless
and the elderly.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.886
That pains your conscience?

14:03.930 --> 14:06.454
It does when it's also
designed to rewrite a legacy

14:06.497 --> 14:08.325
with an utterly false narrative.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.153
That being
that your mother is anything

14:10.197 --> 14:12.199
but a caring, nurturing person?

14:12.242 --> 14:13.374
Yes.

14:13.417 --> 14:16.203
The charity
is 80% bankrolled by her.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.031
Her name is on it.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.815
Do you think
the people who benefit

14:19.859 --> 14:21.730
care that she was mean
to her son?

14:21.773 --> 14:22.731
I don't know.

14:22.774 --> 14:26.343
I do. They don't.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.043
I thought this was a
meeting, not a lecture.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.566
This is a meeting.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.134
This is my half of the agenda.

14:34.177 --> 14:37.615
And the bullet point is:
get over yourself.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.750
Says yet another guy
she had under her spell.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.756
No.

14:47.799 --> 14:50.498
And I think
you're smarter than that.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.239
But prove me wrong.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.852
I'm a special-needs
schoolteacher in the Bronx.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.550
A tiny fraction of her estate

14:59.594 --> 15:02.292
would have made
all the difference in my life.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.729
Would have supported
the good work I try to do

15:04.773 --> 15:07.123
with kids who really need it.

15:08.168 --> 15:12.302
Well, we did some homework.

15:12.346 --> 15:16.698
Her will was unchanged
from when your father wrote it.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.876
Except to fund her charity work

15:20.920 --> 15:24.053
at the expense
of his alma mater.

15:24.097 --> 15:27.796
What are you saying? I'm saying she didn't
cut you out of the will.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.667
You were never in it

15:29.711 --> 15:33.367
as per your father's wish.

15:35.673 --> 15:39.982
See, it turns out that,
uh, he saw an ambition

15:40.026 --> 15:43.290
and a work ethic in you
he didn't see in your sisters,

15:43.333 --> 15:47.859
and he thought that a windfall
might cripple that.

15:51.341 --> 15:54.736
You were their firstborn, right?

15:54.779 --> 15:55.780
Yes.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.957
Hmm. Me, too.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.265
Which means we were
early experiments for two people

16:02.309 --> 16:06.008
who couldn't possibly know
what they were doing.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.491
If your experiment fails,

16:10.534 --> 16:13.059
you analyze your mistakes,

16:13.102 --> 16:16.714
and you make corrections
in your methods.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.326
She never did that once.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.025
Mm.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.071
Tell me something.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.116
Did you love your mom?

16:33.601 --> 16:36.821
Are you gonna tell me that's
not a complicated question?

16:38.867 --> 16:40.129
No.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.133
Yes and no.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.842
I'm not so sure about this, bro.

16:57.886 --> 16:58.930
Me, neither.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.455
But Erin says jump,
I say how high.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.500
And how hard does the
building shake when you do?

17:03.544 --> 17:05.111
Smart-ass.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.679
Leo, thank you for coming in.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.942
This is my brother Jamie
and Officer Hurley.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.291
Leo. LEO:
How's it going, guys?

17:12.335 --> 17:14.032
Better now.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.948
Erin says you used to run
with Freddy Fallaci's old gang,

17:16.992 --> 17:18.428
same as Manny Langston. LEO: Yeah.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.473
Guy's a grade A wackaloon.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.563
Well, he tried to kill
these two the other day.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.435
Can we get to the plan already?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.394
Simple. We figure
Manny may actually answer

17:27.436 --> 17:29.048
the phone if he sees
it's Leo calling.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.137
Leo, you say
you want back in the game,

17:31.180 --> 17:32.399
need to buy a gun.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.270
Manny shows up for the meet,
we grab him.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.447
I don't know.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.101
He's always snorting something.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.060
Paranoid up the wazoo.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.757
Mm-hmm. Besides,

17:42.800 --> 17:44.604
I thought you told me I
was done with this life.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.108
I told them, too.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.892
We really need your help, Leo.

17:47.936 --> 17:48.980
And don't worry.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.808
We'll be close.
Both of us, right?

17:51.809 --> 17:53.115
If you say so, Sarge.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.597
And I get a gun, too?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.947
No, I'm sorry.
Not with your record.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.905
Then I'm out. ABETEMARCO: Leo,

18:00.949 --> 18:02.342
you can trust them. Bro,

18:02.385 --> 18:03.560
I thought I could trust you.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.301
'Cause you keep telling me

18:05.345 --> 18:06.998
to keep my nose clean,

18:07.042 --> 18:09.392
not so much as think about
anyone I used to know.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.786
And you're doing great.
You really are.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.309
Till you get in a jam here.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.442
Then you want to throw me
back in with those animals.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.618
Dangle me like bait.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.945
Maybe there's a different plan.
Yeah, maybe there's

18:20.969 --> 18:22.971
a different brother
you can sucker into this,

18:23.014 --> 18:24.625
'cause it ain't gonna be me.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.249
Janko, Witten.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.295
Someone to see you.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.864
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.605
Why'd he come and find us?

18:48.649 --> 18:50.912
Hopefully to confess.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.396
Hi, my name's Eli Harris.
What's yours?

18:56.439 --> 18:57.875
I'm Eddie.
This is Rachel.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.921
But Eddie's a boy's
name, and you're a girl.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.184
And you have a ring, so
you're married. But, Rachel,

19:02.228 --> 19:04.969
you don't,
so you want to go on a date?

19:05.013 --> 19:07.929
Uh, I'm good. ELI: Okay. Well,

19:07.972 --> 19:10.192
I want to hug both of you,
but that's inappropriate,

19:10.236 --> 19:11.585
so I'm gonna shake your hands.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.064
You probably think I'm weird,

19:13.108 --> 19:14.849
but I'm not.
I have Williams syndrome.

19:14.892 --> 19:15.980
It's not contagious.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.243
I just talk too much.

19:17.286 --> 19:20.071
My doctor says
I have a cocktail personality.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.769
Why were you smiling
at us yesterday?

19:21.812 --> 19:23.573
I know it's wrong to smile
when someone's dead,

19:23.597 --> 19:25.033
but I wanted to talk to you.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.383
Because you did a bad thing?
No, but I saw who did.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.429
I take a lot of walks,
and I saw the man

19:29.472 --> 19:31.233
who hurt the girl,
then threw her in the pool.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.214
Do you know his name?

19:32.258 --> 19:33.694
No, but I can describe him.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.217
I'm good at describing things.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.629
Like... Let's hear about that later.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.283
Right now you got to talk
to the police officer

19:38.307 --> 19:39.937
who's trying to find
the man that you saw.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.005
Detective.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.200
Is he nice? I like nice people

19:42.224 --> 19:43.660
but not mean people.
That's why

19:43.704 --> 19:45.551
I left the other day,
because I saw you were pretty,

19:45.575 --> 19:46.987
but I didn't know you were nice. JANKO:
Don't worry.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.772
He's very nice.
Detective, this is... ELI: Hi.

19:48.796 --> 19:49.840
I'm Eli Harris.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.146
I have Williams syndrome.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.254
I'd like to hug you,
but that's inappropriate,

19:52.278 --> 19:54.367
so I'm gonna shake your hand.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.196
Wow, you're tall.
I'm a little taller.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.981
You're bald.
I have hair. The end.

20:00.024 --> 20:03.114
Eli here may have critical
information on your pool murder.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.180
Right this way, sir. No, I'd
like to stay with them.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.162
It's okay, Eli. We'll be nearby.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.445
He's not gonna hurt me, is he?
Don't let him hurt me! This way. No, no...

20:09.469 --> 20:11.471
Maybe one of us
should go with him.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.734
Not unless you want a rip.
What the hell is going on?

20:14.778 --> 20:16.911
That's the guy from the pool.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.391
And once again,

20:18.434 --> 20:20.784
somehow you forgot
to run it through me.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.657
You can't be mad we may have
found a witness to a murder.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.833
It would be nice
if you had our backs.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.617
Yeah, because we're all women.No.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.291
Because we're all cops. McNICHOLS: Listen,

20:29.315 --> 20:31.969
Janko, I know how you
operated with your husband.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.189
Above and beyond and all that.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.148
But you work midnights now,
and I am your squad sergeant,

20:37.192 --> 20:39.586
and we play by my rules.
Same for you, Witten.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.370
Yes, Sarge.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.982
Then get out there
and do your jobs...

20:45.026 --> 20:47.333
while you still got them.

20:54.165 --> 20:57.125
Mr. and Mrs. Chen, thanks
for getting here so quickly.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.735
Your message said a young woman

20:58.779 --> 20:59.606
was brought in.

20:59.649 --> 21:00.694
Can we see her?

21:00.737 --> 21:03.131
Actually, that was a lie.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.873
We asked her to call.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.962
We knew you wouldn't
talk to cops,

21:08.005 --> 21:10.399
since you hate them so much,
so we did what we had to do.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.706
No... speak English. BAEZ:
We know

21:12.749 --> 21:14.838
you speak English,
just like we know you lived here

21:14.882 --> 21:16.187
for over 30 years.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.319
Just like we know

21:17.363 --> 21:18.364
it's your daughter Jill

21:18.407 --> 21:19.887
whose body you're looking for.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.150
Our daughter is dead.

21:22.193 --> 21:25.022
Do you hate cops so much that
you didn't even want to call us

21:25.066 --> 21:27.590
for help to at least find out
who might've killed her?

21:27.634 --> 21:29.766
We already know.

21:30.767 --> 21:33.074
Because...

21:33.117 --> 21:35.032
we killed her.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.512
♪

21:44.128 --> 21:45.521
Please just tell us
what happened.

21:45.565 --> 21:46.566
I told you.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.176
We killed Jill. Okay,

21:48.219 --> 21:49.960
from the beginning, please,

21:50.004 --> 21:51.397
step by step.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.312
We wanted Jill to get married.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.532
We found her a husband. Let me guess.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.665
Jill didn't want to marry
a perfect stranger,

21:58.708 --> 22:01.015
so she told you both
to go to hell.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.146
No.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.931
Jill was fine with it.

22:03.974 --> 22:04.932
No, she was not.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.368
She just said that

22:06.412 --> 22:08.196
to make us happy.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.418
She was a good daughter.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.204
But he was a bad man.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.380
He yelled at her all the time.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.208
Said she was
"too American."

22:21.252 --> 22:22.515
And he hit her.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.995
When I told him to stop,

22:25.039 --> 22:26.780
he hit me.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.303
He hit you, too?

22:33.090 --> 22:35.745
Okay. Back it up, now.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.443
How exactly did Jill die?

22:37.486 --> 22:38.792
A month ago,

22:38.835 --> 22:42.099
we came back from work,
and they were gone.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.450
They took all of their stuff.

22:45.494 --> 22:48.062
There was blood everywhere.

22:50.325 --> 22:53.110
Now we just want to find her

22:53.154 --> 22:55.765
to give her a proper burial.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.464
Okay, not for nothin',

22:58.507 --> 23:00.683
but it sounds
like it was Jill's husband

23:00.727 --> 23:02.337
who killed her, not you.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.078
I don't understand.No.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.166
We did.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.210
By forcing her

23:06.254 --> 23:09.518
to abide by our ways.

23:09.562 --> 23:12.434
Our stupidity got her killed.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.653
And you hate the cops

23:13.696 --> 23:16.090
so much that you didn't want
to come to us?

23:16.133 --> 23:17.396
I told him to.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.223
But he said no. Because it is

23:19.267 --> 23:21.182
our duty to take care of her.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.836
She is our daughter.

23:26.187 --> 23:29.712
Well, for whatever it's worth,
you're here now.

23:29.756 --> 23:32.106
Okay? And we're
on the case now.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.415
I give you my word
we'll find him...

23:36.458 --> 23:39.330
and we'll find out
what happened to Jill.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.247
Hey, Meyers, drive 'em home,
help 'em get what we need.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.684
Will do.
Right this way, folks.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.599
How could you do this?!

23:46.642 --> 23:49.689
Huh? How could you do this?! Hey, whoa.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.928
Hey! Not this way.
Not this way. Huh? Hey, what do you know?

23:51.952 --> 23:54.650
Did your parents toss you aside
like a piece of garbage?

23:54.694 --> 23:56.826
Did they get your sister killed?

23:56.870 --> 23:59.350
What I know is, your parents
did not get your sister killed.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.091
All right? Now,
you're gonna tone it down

24:01.135 --> 24:02.591
in our squad room,
or you're gonna get

24:02.615 --> 24:04.617
the hell out.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.664
You want to talk to your
parents, you talk civilly.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.322
Son, please...

24:14.365 --> 24:15.105
Don't...

24:15.149 --> 24:16.977
don't call me that.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.108
You said

24:18.152 --> 24:19.552
I wasn't good enough
to be your son.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.941
We made so many mistakes.

24:26.334 --> 24:29.250
We can never make up for
the things that we have done.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.906
But you...

24:32.949 --> 24:35.256
are our son.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.218
You will always be.

24:41.262 --> 24:45.135
Just like Jill
will always be our daughter.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.139
Please...

25:03.632 --> 25:05.025
Now?

25:07.114 --> 25:09.856
There does seem to be
an opening.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.206
Although we're still eating,

25:12.249 --> 25:14.774
if it's gonna be one
of your Molotov cocktails.

25:14.817 --> 25:15.905
It's not.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.690
It's more like...

25:17.733 --> 25:20.257
a preannouncement.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.477
Wow.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.827
Like a save-the-date?

25:24.871 --> 25:26.873
Not really.
More like a...

25:26.916 --> 25:29.310
this might happen.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.399
Okay, out with it.

25:31.442 --> 25:35.359
I am flying to San Francisco
tomorrow for a job interview.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.448
- Wow.
- Long way to go

25:37.492 --> 25:38.885
for a job interview.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.148
Yeah, they got a lot of jobs
right here in New York.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.628
Not this one.

25:42.671 --> 25:45.456
I mean, they're flying me there,
paying for my hotel...

25:45.500 --> 25:46.588
What's the job?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.721
Helping to identify
and back candidates

25:48.764 --> 25:50.287
for localized SRls

25:50.331 --> 25:52.420
in economically challenged
urban areas.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.290
Figures.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.205
What are SRis again? Again?

25:55.249 --> 25:57.512
Socially responsible
investments.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.863
Right. So, green initiatives,
minority start-ups...

26:00.907 --> 26:02.735
Awesome.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.364
Talk about right
up your alley. NICKY: Right?

26:04.388 --> 26:05.346
Good for you.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.782
Who's the company?

26:06.826 --> 26:09.132
It's privately funded
by a tech billionaire.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.003
Of course.

26:10.046 --> 26:11.613
Named? I can't say.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.703
I'm not even supposed to be
telling you guys at this point.

26:14.747 --> 26:15.878
So it's a Bond villain?

26:15.922 --> 26:16.749
No!

26:16.792 --> 26:18.925
And if you're offered the job?

26:33.504 --> 26:36.507
Then she will be moving
across the country.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.728
Come on.
First Jack, now you?

26:39.772 --> 26:41.295
What is it with these kids? FRANK:
Pop.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.427
Hey. Congratulations, Nicky.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.299
Yeah, it's a good thing.Congratulations.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.387
Congratulations.Really.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.910
I don't have it yet.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.173
Well, if you do get it, which...

26:50.217 --> 26:51.653
I'm sure you will,

26:51.697 --> 26:55.396
do us all a favor and,
uh, download this.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.137
I mean, all of this.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.660
Keep it close to you.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.793
And don't stay away too long.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.230
I won't.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.492
Well, in fact...

27:04.535 --> 27:07.103
you may have to,
the way the world is today,

27:07.147 --> 27:08.801
but... Danny's right.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.324
Keep this...

27:10.367 --> 27:12.456
close to you.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.024
Us.

27:18.114 --> 27:20.203
In fact...

27:21.770 --> 27:23.990
take this with you.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.819
And when you come
to a fork in the road...

27:26.862 --> 27:29.082
and you're stuck...

27:31.954 --> 27:34.478
you take that out,
and you think hard

27:34.522 --> 27:36.567
about what the advice would be,

27:36.611 --> 27:39.440
where the sympathies would lie

27:39.483 --> 27:42.965
if you were talking it out
with us at this table.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.103
How's that for corny?

27:51.452 --> 27:53.454
♪

28:01.114 --> 28:03.377
Want card and Finest Message
issued on Jill's husband.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.684
Port Authority and Border Patrol
are on the lookout, too.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.729
All right, and here's the list

28:07.773 --> 28:09.557
of his possible contacts
from the Chens.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.037
Let's run 'em down.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.299
Need some help?

28:13.561 --> 28:15.737
Not from you.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.565
I'm sorry about the other day.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.393
And yet you're back.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.134
Please. He killed my sister.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.614
Sorry.
You've done enough already.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.487
What if it was Erin?

28:27.531 --> 28:28.532
What?

28:28.576 --> 28:29.969
That's your sister, right?

28:30.012 --> 28:32.101
From the
D.A.'s office?

28:32.145 --> 28:34.408
What if her body was
out there somewhere?

28:35.452 --> 28:37.716
Mm, the family card. Ouch.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.215
We're also gonna
guess half the people

28:39.239 --> 28:40.477
on that list don't
speak English,

28:40.501 --> 28:41.937
or they'll suddenly forget how.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.635
I know I forgot to take
Mandarin in high school.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.988
Okay, fine.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.424
But you're not investigators.

28:50.467 --> 28:53.166
You follow our lead every step
of the way, you got it?

28:54.994 --> 28:56.822
Let's go.

29:04.264 --> 29:07.354
Ms. Reagan,
what are you doing here?

29:07.397 --> 29:09.225
Apologizing.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.445
Not necessary. No, it is.

29:11.488 --> 29:14.143
You know, I ask a
lot of my family,

29:14.187 --> 29:17.103
and it's not fair that I
do it to other people's.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.802
Anthony was pretty pissed
I walked out the other day.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.717
And he's moping
around the office.

29:22.761 --> 29:26.503
Hearing you say you don't
trust him really stung.

29:26.547 --> 29:27.853
It's just...

29:27.896 --> 29:31.247
trust wasn't a part
of my DNA for a long time.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.336
I mean, he's helping me

29:33.380 --> 29:35.338
get some back.

29:35.382 --> 29:37.427
And then he walks me
into that...

29:37.471 --> 29:38.602
On my orders.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.343
So, again, that's my bad.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.694
It's not that I don't want
to help you guys.

29:45.653 --> 29:48.308
But Anthony's busted his ass
straightening me out.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.700
So...

29:49.744 --> 29:53.574
what if I dip my toe
back into my old life,

29:53.617 --> 29:54.967
and I like it?

29:56.620 --> 29:58.927
I just don't want
to disappoint him.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.537
He said the same thing
about you, Leo.

30:00.581 --> 30:03.105
How could hedisappoint me?

30:03.149 --> 30:05.629
By taking my side
instead of yours.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.675
He actually told you that? No.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.590
But I've gotten really good

30:09.633 --> 30:13.420
at deciphering all the clicks
and grunts that brothers make.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.091
I still don't get
what we're doing here.

30:32.134 --> 30:34.310
The opening's not
for another two days.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.312
This, like,
a rehearsal or something?

30:36.356 --> 30:37.618
Or something.

30:37.661 --> 30:38.661
This way.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.673
Afternoon.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.069
What's this?

30:56.028 --> 30:59.509
When's the last time
you two and your brother

30:59.553 --> 31:01.511
had a meal together?

31:01.555 --> 31:04.601
At the reception
after our mother's funeral.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.561
When's the last time
you had dinner together

31:07.604 --> 31:09.432
as a family?

31:09.476 --> 31:11.695
You mean just us and Matt?

31:11.739 --> 31:14.046
Just both of you and Matt.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.571
Boss.

31:27.624 --> 31:30.497
I had hoped your brother
was going to join you,

31:30.540 --> 31:32.542
but apparently he can't.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.111
Or won't.

31:38.548 --> 31:39.636
Look,

31:39.680 --> 31:42.465
you're orphans now.

31:42.509 --> 31:45.120
All you got
for family is each other.

31:47.209 --> 31:49.559
So, if you want a real Christmas

31:49.603 --> 31:51.605
or a birthday card

31:51.648 --> 31:54.913
or just someone
to call on a Sunday night,

31:54.956 --> 31:57.698
it's just you and the other two.

31:57.741 --> 32:01.267
You talk like we don't have
people in our lives.No.

32:01.310 --> 32:04.096
I know you got other people
in your life.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.751
But only Mindy

32:07.795 --> 32:10.798
and Matt are family.

32:17.152 --> 32:19.633
And... if the only time

32:19.676 --> 32:23.376
you get together is
at weddings and funerals,

32:23.419 --> 32:25.465
it's gonna haunt you.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.078
I promise.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.692
So...

32:35.736 --> 32:38.130
talk amongst yourselves.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.534
Yeah, I booked his travel

32:51.578 --> 32:53.710
from China and met him
when he landed at JFK.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.669
He was so excited,
said he was getting married.

32:55.712 --> 32:58.498
Have you heard from him since,
like to book a flight back?

32:58.541 --> 32:59.586
No. Why would he?

32:59.629 --> 33:01.936
You don't want to know. Thanks.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.025
That was the last
name on our list.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.505
At least it doesn't sound like

33:05.548 --> 33:07.246
he's hightailed it
back to Beijing.

33:07.289 --> 33:08.682
Yeah, except now
we have to search

33:08.725 --> 33:10.075
the entire continental U.S.

33:10.118 --> 33:11.772
It's Andy's partner.

33:11.815 --> 33:14.209
Maybe they have better news.

33:14.253 --> 33:15.732
Yeah. What do you got?

33:15.776 --> 33:16.820
A situation.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.083
We found a Realtor who talked

33:18.126 --> 33:19.669
to Jill's husband
the night she disappeared.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.521
Hubby was covered in blood,
wouldn't explain,

33:21.564 --> 33:24.176
paid cash, and said
he needed a safe place to stay.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.525
You got an address?

33:25.568 --> 33:27.353
252 Albion Avenue,

33:27.396 --> 33:29.268
Number 3J, in Queens,
but once we got it,

33:29.311 --> 33:31.400
Andy ran to our car,
jumped in, and drove off

33:31.444 --> 33:32.836
before I could even
open my door.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.969
Son of a bitch. Bad news?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.710
Bad news for everyone. Let's go.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.626
What'd you do with her?!

33:39.669 --> 33:41.584
Tell me!

33:41.628 --> 33:44.674
I know you speak English,
so start talking!

33:44.718 --> 33:45.806
Tell me! Hey! Hey!

33:45.849 --> 33:47.460
Hey! Andy!

33:47.503 --> 33:49.351
Put the gun back in its holster
where it belongs right now.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.615
He killed Jill, and now he's
trying to leave the country.

33:52.508 --> 33:53.548
Would you let that happen?

33:54.684 --> 33:55.816
'Cause I'm not.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.122
Andy, that's enough.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.485
You got one second
before you die,

33:58.514 --> 33:59.863
you miserable son of a bitch.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.214
Andy, use your head
and put the gun away now!

34:03.693 --> 34:05.260
Now step away.

34:14.181 --> 34:16.141
Hey!

34:16.184 --> 34:18.621
Call him a bus.

34:18.665 --> 34:21.710
Two-Steven to Central.

34:21.755 --> 34:25.759
We need a bus at
252 Albion Avenue,

34:25.802 --> 34:27.804
Number 3J, forthwith.

34:28.717 --> 34:31.069
Wait.
He was making two passports...

34:31.112 --> 34:32.940
One for him
and one for your sister.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.246
She's still alive?

34:34.289 --> 34:36.813
Jill? Are you here?

34:36.857 --> 34:38.119
Jill? Jill?

34:38.163 --> 34:39.902
Hey, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Where is she?

34:39.947 --> 34:41.775
Where is she?! Huh? Hey! Hey!

34:41.818 --> 34:43.123
Use your head.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.342
Jill?

34:44.386 --> 34:45.953
Your sister's alive,
we'll find her.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.215
Where are you?

34:47.259 --> 34:48.650
Jill?

34:50.391 --> 34:51.741
I found her.

34:51.784 --> 34:53.134
She's okay.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.875
Jill?

34:54.918 --> 34:56.703
Okay, go. Oh, my God, Jill.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.619
Andy!

35:02.665 --> 35:04.014
Hey, you're okay.
Okay...

35:04.058 --> 35:06.843
I'm okay.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.326
What do you think?

35:11.370 --> 35:13.415
You think their parents
will still hate cops now?

35:13.459 --> 35:15.461
Not after what you did.Hmm.

35:15.504 --> 35:16.940
Reagan, this is all you.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.857
This some kind of
apology from you?

35:20.901 --> 35:23.686
More like a slip of the tongue.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.780
Leaving now to get the warrant.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.042
Just sit on his place.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.914
We'll boom the door
when I get there.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.657
Think Eli finally
gave you the right guy?

35:37.700 --> 35:39.485
Described Eddie Astin to a tee.

35:39.528 --> 35:40.877
A known psycho.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.270
Besides, Eli didn't
give it to me.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.706
He gave it to you and Janko.

35:43.750 --> 35:44.838
So, thanks.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.753
What do you think?
Did I do good?

35:46.796 --> 35:49.103
You did great, Eli. I want to hug you,

35:49.147 --> 35:51.888
but I know it's inappropriate,
so I'm gonna shake your hands.

35:51.932 --> 35:54.848
Actually, I think
this time it'd be okay.

35:54.891 --> 35:55.936
Really?

35:55.979 --> 35:57.285
I can hug both of you?

35:57.329 --> 35:59.461
Bring it in, big guy.

35:59.505 --> 36:02.116
Oh, that's nice. Your turn.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.901
Oh.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.033
Hey, Eli, you know

36:06.076 --> 36:08.296
who could use a hug,
even more than us?

36:10.037 --> 36:11.778
Uh-uh. That lady seems mean.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.736
Please go and hug her, Eli.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.303
I promise she'll love it.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.872
Okay.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.488
Hi.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.011
Hi.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.491
Oh, my God.

36:31.798 --> 36:32.973
Bye.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.366
Bye.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.246
You're gonna
get us canned, Eddie.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.640
Or back working days.

37:05.962 --> 37:08.051
Here comes our guy.

37:08.095 --> 37:10.053
Manny. My man.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.925
I was surprised you called, Leo.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.883
Lot of people think
that you went straight.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.015
You know, some even think

37:15.058 --> 37:18.366
that it was, uh, you
who gave up Freddy.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.326
No. I've just been lying low.

37:22.588 --> 37:23.937
But now I'm back,

37:23.980 --> 37:26.374
bigger than life and
twice as handsome.

37:31.205 --> 37:32.380
You bring the piece?

37:32.424 --> 37:33.860
You got my money?

37:36.341 --> 37:39.300
Okay, it's go time. Wait, wait till Leo
gets the gun from him.

37:48.396 --> 37:49.354
First,

37:49.397 --> 37:50.311
you got to swear

37:50.355 --> 37:51.419
you weren't the little bitch

37:51.443 --> 37:52.400
who gave up Freddy.

37:52.444 --> 37:53.401
Well, I-I don't.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.924
I-I... I mean, I-I didn't.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.839
Get the hell
away from him! Police! Drop it!

37:56.883 --> 37:58.363
Put it down! Drop it!

38:02.932 --> 38:03.977
Get his ass, Jamie!

38:19.297 --> 38:20.341
Did you see that?

38:20.385 --> 38:22.082
Went down like a sack of crap.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.519
You still want to quit the job?

38:24.563 --> 38:25.433
Oh, hell, no.

38:25.477 --> 38:26.826
You cuff him up.

38:26.869 --> 38:28.044
That's your first collar.

38:31.134 --> 38:33.267
Nice work, guys.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.531
You did good, too, Leo.

38:36.575 --> 38:37.967
Sorry about freezing up.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.142
I guess

38:39.186 --> 38:40.883
I've gotten rusty
being a bad guy.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.885
Music to my ears.

38:49.892 --> 38:52.939
Look, I woke up this morning.
I knew he was coming.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.855
I-I'd say we can push,
but most of the people here need

38:55.898 --> 38:58.118
to be someplace else. Him included.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.902
Look, you did what you can do.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.122
You know, that's
all anyone can do.

39:02.165 --> 39:04.167
You'd better get up there.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.404
Afternoon, everyone.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.020
I knew Mary Jane Kaye.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.806
I worked with Mary Jane Kaye.

39:33.849 --> 39:36.069
And I shouldn't have
to tell this group,

39:36.112 --> 39:39.420
there was only one
Mary Jane Kaye, so...

39:39.464 --> 39:42.684
If there is any cloud

39:42.728 --> 39:46.514
over this wonderful event,

39:46.558 --> 39:49.604
it's that MJ isn't here.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.606
To boss us all around.

39:55.828 --> 39:58.221
I think I was supposed
to go first.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.143
May I cut in?

40:09.276 --> 40:13.149
I would like to
introduce her son Matt.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.674
Please.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.205
As a special needs teacher

40:25.248 --> 40:27.425
in the New York
Public Schools system,

40:27.468 --> 40:30.602
I'm well aware of the
divide between the haves

40:30.645 --> 40:32.647
and the have-nots.

40:34.519 --> 40:37.783
I see it live,
literally every day.

40:43.353 --> 40:46.966
One of the things
I loved about my mother...

40:51.274 --> 40:53.233
and there were

40:53.276 --> 40:56.628
many things to love...

40:56.671 --> 41:00.458
Was that she tried
to do something about it...

41:02.590 --> 41:06.333
in some way, almost every day.

41:09.423 --> 41:12.252
Along with my sisters
Misty and Mindy,

41:12.295 --> 41:15.603
I want to welcome you
to the opening

41:15.647 --> 41:18.563
of our late mom's last wish...

41:18.606 --> 41:22.218
