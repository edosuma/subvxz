♪♪

00:10.261 --> 00:12.393
Busy day at
the slushy stand?

00:12.393 --> 00:14.475
This town's gone
slushy crazy.

00:14.475 --> 00:17.308
We ran out of all of
our usual flavors at work today,

00:17.308 --> 00:19.350
so I had to invent one.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.313
Okay, so we're out of
Sweet Carol-lime,

00:22.313 --> 00:25.646
Cherry Underwood,
we're even out of Kale-or Swift.

00:25.646 --> 00:27.358
But don't worry.

00:27.358 --> 00:29.490
I have a new delicious
flavor.

00:29.490 --> 00:32.913
Slushy Classic.

00:32.913 --> 00:35.416
- It's just crushed ice
and tap water.
- Mmm.

00:35.416 --> 00:37.118
Sold seven of them.

00:37.118 --> 00:39.420
Those hipsters
will buy anything.

00:44.425 --> 00:46.757
All I wanna do
is plop down on the couch,

00:46.757 --> 00:50.511
watch TV, and stuff my face
with leftover wings

00:50.511 --> 00:51.882
from Wingapore Palace.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.726
Here, birdy, birdy, birdy.

01:01.442 --> 01:03.023
They're gone?

01:03.023 --> 01:05.186
Are you kidding me?

01:05.186 --> 01:07.528
I even hid them behind
the yams that have
been there since Easter.

01:07.528 --> 01:09.360
You hid leftovers
in the fridge?

01:09.360 --> 01:10.991
In this house?

01:10.991 --> 01:12.323
You gotta hide them
on your person.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.905
- Egg roll?
- Pass.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.413
Ever since school got out,

01:22.413 --> 01:25.756
Rachel's boyfriend Cuff
has been at the house nonstop.

01:25.756 --> 01:29.800
In a family of nine, the last
thing you need is ten.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.383
It's like when your sibling
is dating someone,

01:32.383 --> 01:34.385
the whole family's
dating them, too.

01:36.597 --> 01:40.681
Rachel, this is supposed
to be my TV time.

01:40.681 --> 01:43.814
I let you watch last night
so I could watch now.

01:43.814 --> 01:45.986
But what have you done
for Cuff?

01:45.986 --> 01:47.818
He likes to watch
 Man Vs. Dumpster.

01:47.818 --> 01:49.440
It's how he unwinds.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.442
From what?

01:51.442 --> 01:52.693
He doesn't have a job.

01:56.947 --> 01:58.539
Texas Barbecue Edition.

01:58.539 --> 02:00.541
CUFF: Sweet.
I've seen this one.

02:00.541 --> 02:02.543
Spoiler alert: Dumpster Jack
finds a week-old brisket

02:02.543 --> 02:04.795
in a mannequin head.

02:06.086 --> 02:10.670
Did you just toss a chicken bone
into my invention bag?

02:10.670 --> 02:13.594
Uh, sorry. There was a bunch
of junk in there.

02:13.594 --> 02:15.176
I thought it was
a garbage bag.

02:19.099 --> 02:20.811
Hey.

02:20.811 --> 02:25.436
Guys, my TV time.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.229
So let's play the quiet game
while Harley watches Dance Dads.

02:28.229 --> 02:31.612
Dance Dads record
request cancelled?

02:31.612 --> 02:33.234
What?!

02:33.234 --> 02:35.776
Stop shouting, Harley.
We are trying to relax.

02:35.776 --> 02:37.868
I thought we were playing
the quiet game.

02:37.868 --> 02:40.661
You cancelled Dance Dads
 for a show about a guy

02:40.661 --> 02:41.952
who digs through garbage?!

02:41.952 --> 02:43.624
Digs through and eats.

02:43.624 --> 02:45.586
Gotta give Dumpster Jack
full props.

02:45.586 --> 02:47.418
Cuff is our guest.

02:47.418 --> 02:49.590
Don't be rude.

02:51.592 --> 02:53.674
What's rude is forcing me
to watch a show

02:53.674 --> 02:54.795
no one wants to see.

02:54.795 --> 02:56.847
Hey, Man Vs. Dumpster!

02:58.599 --> 03:01.512
That's exactly what
we wanna watch right now.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.896
That guy is like a virus.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.439
The whole family's come
down with whooping Cuff.

03:11.522 --> 03:14.315
Rachel's here more,
he winds up Lewie and Beast.

03:14.315 --> 03:17.027
You're saying that like
it's a bad thing.

03:17.027 --> 03:18.739
With Cuff around,
they don't bug me.

03:18.739 --> 03:21.622
I get to spend more
quality time with Greta.

03:21.622 --> 03:23.374
I'm going to channel
this negativity

03:23.374 --> 03:24.875
into something useful.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.957
Maybe finish
my solar-heated birdbath.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.383
Wow, that slushy syrup
is sticky.

03:33.714 --> 03:37.137
Cuff, Cuff, Cuff, Cuff,
Cuff, Cuff, Cuff, Cuff.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.932
I guess
 Man Vs. Dumpster's over.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.210
This is what's available
when you're hiding in a pantry.

04:50.210 --> 04:52.673
First up, the unthinkable.

04:52.673 --> 04:55.796
Marshmallows dipped in
mayonnaise.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.339
I heard even goats
can't keep that down.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.920
What should we call it?

04:59.920 --> 05:02.803
Mayonallow or
marshonnaise?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.476
Let's call it both,

05:05.476 --> 05:06.597
and do it twice!

05:10.521 --> 05:11.982
Get 'em while they're gross!

05:11.982 --> 05:13.694
Yeah!

05:13.694 --> 05:16.196
Yesterday it was
 forehead karate.

05:16.196 --> 05:19.109
Today, it's
 the iron gut challenge.

05:19.109 --> 05:21.822
Tomorrow, I hear it's
 roadkill autopsy.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.704
They have no respect for
 people who bust their humps

05:23.704 --> 05:25.946
working for a living.

05:25.946 --> 05:30.621
I mean, if Cuff had any idea
what it's like to have a job...

05:30.621 --> 05:32.953
That's it.

05:32.953 --> 05:36.006
The cure for
the common Cuff.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.508
If that dummy had a job,

05:37.508 --> 05:40.220
he wouldn't be
stapled to our couch.

05:40.220 --> 05:43.464
- ( muffled )
- That means,

05:43.464 --> 05:45.966
Cuff, you're like
the cool big brother
we never had.

05:45.966 --> 05:47.678
- ( laughs )
- You're the best.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.438
All I'm saying is,
it's nice to have

05:57.438 --> 05:59.900
- a little change
in your pocket.
- Why?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.484
See? Free.

06:03.484 --> 06:05.826
Could use more sugar...

06:05.826 --> 06:07.658
which I'll add.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.540
Also free.

06:09.540 --> 06:10.831
But what about Rachel?

06:10.831 --> 06:13.704
You can't keep a girl
like her sitting around

06:13.704 --> 06:15.295
watching a guy
in a dumpster.

06:15.295 --> 06:18.709
I mean, Kanye just rented
Kim an island in the Caribbean.

06:18.709 --> 06:20.961
You can rent an island?

06:20.961 --> 06:22.713
No, you can't.

06:22.713 --> 06:24.805
But maybe if
you had a job

06:24.805 --> 06:27.558
you could afford the magazine
I saw the picture of
the island in.

06:27.558 --> 06:31.141
Eh. I'm not really
a jobby kind of guy.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.813
I take after my dad
that way.

06:32.813 --> 06:36.437
Okay. I just don't want
Rachel getting bored of you.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.359
That's why she dumped
her last five boyfriends.

06:39.359 --> 06:41.021
Whoa.

06:41.021 --> 06:42.903
I never heard her talk
about any old boyfriends.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.866
Yeah, once they're gone,
they're gone forever.

06:45.866 --> 06:47.908
Scone?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.580
Man.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.911
A job?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.292
I'd need a résumé.

06:52.292 --> 06:54.915
I'd need to get some paper
for that résumé.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.747
I'd need to get
a first job

06:56.747 --> 06:58.128
so I'd have something
to put on that résumé.

06:58.128 --> 06:59.750
I mean, this is
a job already.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.172
Relax. I've got this.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.045
Just let me ask you
a couple of quick questions.

07:05.045 --> 07:07.808
One. Do you have
a last name?

07:09.179 --> 07:13.313
( loud rock music plays )

07:19.940 --> 07:21.361
Hey, who wants to build
a race car

07:21.361 --> 07:22.943
with their cool
brother Ethan?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.985
Race car.

07:24.985 --> 07:27.237
Cool brother Ethan.

07:27.237 --> 07:28.779
( music continues )

07:31.622 --> 07:34.915
Hey, turn it up.
We're rock gods.

07:34.915 --> 07:36.627
Cuff showed us a video

07:36.627 --> 07:39.790
where tons of hairy dudes
smash guitars.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.793
He sure knows
a lot about culture.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.635
That's not such a big deal.

07:44.635 --> 07:46.346
Any fool can smash a guitar.

07:46.346 --> 07:47.798
Great.

07:52.643 --> 07:53.804
Go.

07:56.396 --> 07:59.099
You want me
to smash Greta?

08:03.734 --> 08:05.986
You were right.
Cuff needs to go.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.908
Hate to say
I told you so.

08:07.908 --> 08:10.450
Actually, no,
that felt pretty good.

08:10.450 --> 08:12.032
Up until now,

08:12.032 --> 08:14.244
I never had to try
to be cool.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.247
Being the older brother
automatically gave me cred.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.793
Whoa.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.796
Can't believe you
could reach that plate.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.388
You must have
octopus arms.

08:28.388 --> 08:30.681
They're just arms, boys.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.511
They're just arms.

08:34.895 --> 08:37.938
Plus, I've got the hair,
the dimples,

08:37.938 --> 08:39.399
the laid-back charm.

08:39.399 --> 08:41.942
On paper, I'm
pretty impressive.

08:41.942 --> 08:43.904
The only thing that
needs to look impressive

08:43.904 --> 08:44.985
is Cuff's résumé.

08:44.985 --> 08:47.357
Hit me with
that recon I did.

08:47.357 --> 08:51.031
Well, he got in trouble
with the police

08:51.031 --> 08:52.953
for graffiti-ing
an ice cream truck.

08:52.953 --> 08:55.365
Recognized by the city
for artistic achievement.

08:55.365 --> 08:57.037
He's been thrown out
of several schools.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.830
Comfortable with travel.
Enjoys meeting new people.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.463
There's a surprising amount
of stuff about dumpsters.

09:03.463 --> 09:05.836
Significant experience
in waste management.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.798
When this baby's finished,

09:07.798 --> 09:10.931
I'm gonna submit it to
every job website in America.

09:10.931 --> 09:12.803
Maybe even a few overseas.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.765
Europe better hide
their leftovers.

09:14.765 --> 09:18.098
I almost feel bad for
the sucker who's gonna
hire this guy.

09:18.098 --> 09:20.851
Harley, meet
your new co-worker.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:29.069 --> 09:30.530
You hired Cuff?!

09:30.530 --> 09:33.073
You should see
his résumé.
Very impressive.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.036
Did you know his artwork
was recognized by the city?

09:36.036 --> 09:38.328
Dad, it's Cuff!

09:38.328 --> 09:40.460
Actually, his real name
is Warren.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.002
It's my favorite
uncle's name.

09:42.002 --> 09:43.964
You can't stand him,
remember?

09:46.707 --> 09:47.918
What happened
to my raincoat?

09:47.918 --> 09:49.589
Cuff borrowed it.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.091
He doesn't like stuff
around his wrists.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.422
That's where he got
his name.

09:52.422 --> 09:53.974
Cuff... because
he doesn't like them.

09:53.974 --> 09:56.677
I don't like my coats
becoming vests.

09:56.677 --> 09:59.930
Why do you hate Cuff?

10:01.481 --> 10:04.104
Look, I've never been
a huge fan of Cuff,

10:04.104 --> 10:07.067
but this Warren is
maybe someone I can get behind.

10:07.067 --> 10:08.899
Besides, I needed
the help.

10:08.899 --> 10:12.783
And if he's here,
he can't be alone with Rachel.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.579
Hey, wanna see me stuff
four of these up my nose?

10:19.579 --> 10:21.912
- Not at all.
- Totally right.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.543
Gotta do five.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.054
I can't believe Cuff
went off and got a job.

10:34.054 --> 10:37.888
It feels like there's
one less color in the rainbow.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.760
ETHAN: Step right up.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.973
Step right up,
step right up,

10:42.973 --> 10:45.856
and behold,
the amazing...

10:45.856 --> 10:47.938
smash wagon!

10:47.938 --> 10:50.030
Who's ready to bash
some stuff?

10:50.030 --> 10:52.863
I've gathered
an array of cool things

10:52.863 --> 10:54.034
for your smashing pleasure.

10:54.034 --> 10:56.907
First up, a tub of
ricotta cheese.

10:59.619 --> 11:01.491
And Georgie's old crutch.

11:05.495 --> 11:07.497
Smash-tastic!

11:07.497 --> 11:10.170
Cool. Now do
your guitar.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.053
Let's keep Greta
out of this.

11:13.053 --> 11:16.296
But who wants to smash
Daphne's old training potty?

11:16.296 --> 11:18.008
Rock gods don't
smash potties.

11:18.008 --> 11:20.931
Unless they're throwing them
out of hotel windows.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.973
We're out.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.975
Wait. I haven't shown you
the finale.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.977
Watermelon
and a croquet mallet.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.981
Man versus melon.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.943
Smash-tastic.

11:41.081 --> 11:42.743
Who am I?

11:46.416 --> 11:48.628
I'd stay away from
those today.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.133
Great. I created
a monster,

11:53.133 --> 11:55.045
and got him
a part-time job.

11:55.045 --> 11:57.717
But if I created him,
I can destroy him.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.299
I'll get Cuff to quit

11:59.299 --> 12:00.801
by showing him
the down side of work.

12:00.801 --> 12:02.973
The working.

12:06.396 --> 12:08.438
Hey, Dad, you shouldn't be
lifting that.

12:08.438 --> 12:10.190
Remember your bad back?

12:10.190 --> 12:11.271
No.

12:11.271 --> 12:13.193
Remember your bad memory?

12:13.193 --> 12:15.275
Take a load off.

12:15.275 --> 12:17.067
Cuff can do it.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.448
Oh, Cuff.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.372
You were right, Harls.
That does feel better.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.089
Man, the inside of
this thing is filthy.

12:39.089 --> 12:40.050
HARLEY: Cuff!

12:40.050 --> 12:41.802
Cool.

12:43.183 --> 12:45.345
Eesh. This thing
is full of fish guts.

12:45.345 --> 12:47.227
HARLEY: Cuff!

12:49.059 --> 12:50.600
Boy, it better rain soon.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.063
There is a lot of
seagull poop on the dinghies.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.694
HARLEY: Cuff!

12:58.658 --> 13:00.821
Way to put your back
into it, Warren.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.703
Feel free to take
a couple of fish heads
home with you.

13:03.703 --> 13:06.206
But just a couple.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.210
This is a rough job, huh?

13:10.210 --> 13:13.083
Yeah. It's one disgusting
task after another.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.506
No one would blame you
if you wanted to quit right now.

13:16.506 --> 13:18.338
In fact, you should.

13:18.338 --> 13:20.130
Want me to tell Dad?
I'll tell Dad.

13:21.131 --> 13:23.053
No way.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.265
This is the best job ever!

13:25.265 --> 13:27.227
- It is?
- Totally.

13:27.227 --> 13:29.189
Fish guts, bird poop,

13:29.189 --> 13:31.311
gross stuff I should
probably be wearing gloves for.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.103
I get to spend my day
in filth,

13:33.103 --> 13:34.524
and get paid for it.

13:34.524 --> 13:36.857
If that's not
the American dream,

13:36.857 --> 13:38.108
I don't know what is.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.070
Cuff, you gotta ditch work.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.113
My BFF Kiki's cousin is DJ'ing
at the boba place we went to.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.245
You should totally go.

13:45.245 --> 13:46.867
That sounds important.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.538
Sorry. No can do.

13:48.538 --> 13:50.410
A garbage barge overturned
in the bay,

13:50.410 --> 13:53.213
and I get to clean the sludge
off your dad's jet ski rentals.

13:53.213 --> 13:57.127
Wait. You're picking
a garbage barge over me?!

13:57.127 --> 13:59.219
Don't make it a contest.

13:59.219 --> 14:01.421
I have strong feelings
for both of you.

14:01.421 --> 14:05.425
Okay. This and this...

14:05.425 --> 14:07.597
no!

14:07.597 --> 14:09.849
Circle back with
the boba, babe.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.144
If she comes back
with boba,

14:14.144 --> 14:15.145
I wouldn't drink it.

14:18.028 --> 14:21.191
Okay, so getting Cuff a job
didn't turn out like I hoped,

14:21.191 --> 14:23.693
but at least
he's out of the house,

14:23.693 --> 14:25.115
which may be a fair trade.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.538
Let's see.

14:28.538 --> 14:31.701
Is my leftover chicken parm
still in the fridge?

14:37.257 --> 14:39.920
Oh, yeah. Work Cuff is
way better than Home Cuff.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.133
Now let's reintroduce my butt
to its long-lost friend.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.424
The couch.

14:47.347 --> 14:50.350
Hey, girl.
Love those cushions.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.312
Did you miss me?

14:55.605 --> 14:57.187
What are you doing there?

14:57.187 --> 15:00.150
Cuff dumped me...
for his job.

15:06.076 --> 15:07.577
Cuff broke up with you?
Why would he do that?

15:07.577 --> 15:09.789
- You're so pretty.
- ( blowing loudly )

15:09.789 --> 15:11.201
I mean, usually.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.333
Do you know how hard it is
to find a boyfriend

15:13.333 --> 15:15.295
who has nothing going on
but you?

15:15.295 --> 15:17.417
Maybe he's just
going through a phase.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.040
Like that week Dad tried
to grow facial hair.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.212
ETHAN: Hey, Dad,
I need a ride.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.094
Solid.

15:24.094 --> 15:25.635
Cuff broke up with me.

15:25.635 --> 15:27.257
I can't even.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.309
Cuff broke up with us.

15:29.309 --> 15:30.430
We can't even.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.223
Do you know
how hard it is

15:33.223 --> 15:35.765
to find someone
who can keep down

15:35.765 --> 15:38.228
a mayonnaise-covered
marshmallow

15:38.228 --> 15:40.480
while spinning around
on a bat?

15:40.480 --> 15:43.984
We lost the best
big brother we ever had.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.117
I can't even.

15:48.658 --> 15:51.451
When someone breaks up
with a Diaz,

15:51.451 --> 15:53.283
the whole family suffers.

15:53.283 --> 15:55.245
How would I know
getting Cuff a job

15:55.245 --> 15:56.706
would get everyone dumped?

15:58.168 --> 15:59.579
( phone buzzing )

15:59.579 --> 16:01.211
Uh, aren't you
gonna get that?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.752
What's the point?

16:02.752 --> 16:05.295
You're ignoring a text?!

16:05.295 --> 16:07.347
I feel so lost.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.719
Did we come on
too strong?

16:11.301 --> 16:13.513
Know what's worse than watching
someone take your place?

16:13.513 --> 16:17.687
Hearing about it 24/7.

16:17.687 --> 16:20.360
Remember that time Cuff
wore those chickens
on his hands

16:20.360 --> 16:21.861
like boxing gloves?

16:23.363 --> 16:25.485
Dude, I just
stopped crying.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.317
Don't make me
start again.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.869
I just wanna
hear his voice.

16:31.701 --> 16:33.073
( line ringing )

16:33.073 --> 16:35.745
Yeah, this is Cuff.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.577
- Leave a message at the beep.
 - ( farting sound )

16:37.577 --> 16:38.328
Oh, sorry.
 ( beep )

16:38.328 --> 16:40.170
( both sighing )

16:40.170 --> 16:43.463
Hey, guys,
check it out.

16:43.463 --> 16:46.626
- ( farting noise )
- Sorry.

16:46.626 --> 16:48.718
We know that
was your mouth.

16:48.718 --> 16:52.262
Yeah. Butt sounds
way different.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.775
What's with the sweats?

17:07.567 --> 17:09.989
I don't care how I look.

17:09.989 --> 17:12.952
- I just wanna be
comfortable.
- Comfortable?

17:12.952 --> 17:16.326
You wore a tube top
and high heels to
hike the Grand Canyon.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.617
Why would Cuff wanna get
a job anyway?

17:18.617 --> 17:21.371
We could search and search,

17:21.371 --> 17:22.712
and probably
never find out.

17:22.712 --> 17:24.584
I just don't get it.

17:24.584 --> 17:26.165
Maybe he wanted to make
some money

17:26.165 --> 17:27.757
so he could
buy you nice things.

17:27.757 --> 17:29.509
I don't want nice things.

17:29.509 --> 17:31.381
I just wanna spend
time together.

17:36.226 --> 17:39.139
Ugh! I hate when Rachel
acts like a human.

17:39.139 --> 17:41.311
Now I have to act
like a human

17:41.311 --> 17:42.562
and do the right thing.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.945
Gentlemen, I'm about
to rock your world.

17:48.238 --> 17:49.689
Hold onto your hats,

17:49.689 --> 17:52.902
'cause we are
smashing Greta!

17:52.902 --> 17:54.744
I thought Greta
was off-limits.

17:54.744 --> 17:56.366
I saw that you were down,

17:56.366 --> 17:58.118
so I decided to cheer
you up in a way

17:58.118 --> 17:59.829
only the coolest
big brother in the world could.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.832
- ( beeps )
- ( music blares )

18:04.624 --> 18:08.298
Back up, and get ready
to ride the lightning!

18:21.601 --> 18:24.063
Awesome!

18:24.063 --> 18:25.605
This makes me
wanna learn guitar.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.357
Can you teach us
"Smoke On The Water"?

18:32.322 --> 18:34.494
I could...

18:34.494 --> 18:36.286
but I just smashed
my guitar.

18:36.286 --> 18:37.657
Well, that's
very disappointing.

18:37.657 --> 18:39.449
Totally.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.589
Look, I feel bad.

18:49.589 --> 18:51.961
But juggling a girlfriend
and work was tough.

18:51.961 --> 18:54.254
I'm probably the first
guy in the world

18:54.254 --> 18:56.426
who's ever had to balance
something like that.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.639
But Rachel's worth it.
Remember all that great stuff

18:59.639 --> 19:01.681
you loved about her?

19:01.681 --> 19:04.604
Like her long, brown hair
and...

19:04.604 --> 19:07.647
It's brown and long...

19:07.647 --> 19:12.071
and... what is it exactly
you love about Rachel?

19:12.071 --> 19:13.733
She's really pretty.

19:13.733 --> 19:15.195
She smells nice.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.116
She texts super fast.

19:17.116 --> 19:19.949
And that brown hair
really is dope.

19:19.949 --> 19:21.661
The dopest.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.873
What was I thinking?

19:23.873 --> 19:25.955
I guess I got caught up
in the glory of the job.

19:25.955 --> 19:27.747
When you're done
scraping that gum,

19:27.747 --> 19:29.549
a wharf rat's
stuck in the toilet.

19:31.551 --> 19:33.052
All I know is,
Rachel's miserable.

19:33.052 --> 19:34.714
You should've
seen her this morning.

19:34.714 --> 19:38.057
- She was wearing sweatpants.
- And you left her alone?!

19:38.057 --> 19:40.470
I bet if you apologized,
she would take you back.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.603
I don't know.
That girl really
holds a grudge.

19:48.608 --> 19:50.310
What was that for?

19:50.310 --> 19:53.613
- You ate the last cupcake.
- What cupcake?

19:53.613 --> 19:56.576
Two years ago, white cake,
chocolate icing, sprinkles.

19:56.576 --> 19:59.659
I called it,
you ate it.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.033
Yeah, I've heard that.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.665
Sorry might not be enough.

20:05.665 --> 20:08.828
But Rachel is a sucker
for a romantic gesture.

20:08.828 --> 20:11.711
Flowers, candy, some cash
couldn't hurt.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.633
She wouldn't wanna see me.

20:13.633 --> 20:17.297
Even if I had all the dumpster
flowers in the world.

20:17.297 --> 20:19.259
You worry about the gesture,

20:19.259 --> 20:20.970
and I'll worry about Rachel.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.602
We'll be back in an hour.

20:34.854 --> 20:38.027
He's clearly not dead.
What am I doing here?

20:38.027 --> 20:39.949
There's something he would
like to say to you.

20:39.949 --> 20:41.821
Now if you'll excuse me,

20:41.821 --> 20:44.534
I'm gonna go crouch down
behind the rubber boot display

20:44.534 --> 20:45.865
and pretend not to listen.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.710
Rachel, I've made a lot
of mistakes since
I've had this job.

20:50.710 --> 20:53.293
I let a guy walk away
with the bathroom key.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.715
I took more than
a couple of those fish heads.

20:55.715 --> 20:57.717
Get to it.

20:59.589 --> 21:01.641
But the biggest
mistake I made

21:01.641 --> 21:03.553
was choosing this job
over you,

21:03.553 --> 21:06.556
because as much as I care
about garbage,

21:06.556 --> 21:09.599
there's something I care
about even more.

21:15.605 --> 21:16.986
Baby.

21:23.743 --> 21:26.326
Warren. Why?

21:26.326 --> 21:28.868
Cuff, you're fired.

21:28.868 --> 21:30.750
I thought you'd be cool
with it.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.752
You heart Rachel, too.

21:32.752 --> 21:35.585
I also heart
my in-store merchandise.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.126
Get out!

21:44.724 --> 21:46.346
Does this mean
you're hiring,

21:46.346 --> 21:48.097
because I need to earn
some money for a new guitar.

21:48.097 --> 21:49.689
He's hiring.

21:52.392 --> 21:54.814
You can't choose
 who your siblings date,

21:54.814 --> 21:56.696
but if you try
 to get rid of them,

21:56.696 --> 21:58.608
chances are you'll end up
 with a mess.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.940
Only 32 more hours of this,

22:00.940 --> 22:03.573
and I can buy
a new guitar.

22:03.573 --> 22:06.656
Remind me again why I was trying
to impress Lewie and Beast.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.082
No, Ethan,
don't look.

22:13.082 --> 22:16.295
New low. They don't even
want me to look at them.

22:16.295 --> 22:19.419
Whatever they're doing,
that's probably a good thing.

22:19.419 --> 22:22.091
Okay. Now.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.803
Check it out.

22:28.227 --> 22:30.229
We figured out
how to fix Greta.

22:30.229 --> 22:32.852
So now you can teach us
"Smoke On The Water."

22:32.852 --> 22:35.144
Prepare to be rock gods!

22:35.144 --> 22:38.147
On a guitar with
one string.

22:38.147 --> 22:39.979
All right, here we go!

22:41.821 --> 22:45.865
So the boys got
 their real big bro back.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.287
And my leftover pizza.

22:48.287 --> 22:49.659
No longer left over,

22:49.659 --> 22:52.371
which means everything's
 back to normal.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.454
Good-bye, unwind time.

22:54.454 --> 22:56.796
Hello, Cuff on our couch
 until I'm dead.

22:58.458 --> 23:01.501
Hey, Harley,
Cuff ate your pizza.

23:01.501 --> 23:02.882
Yeah, I see that.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.094
But I totally made him
save you the crust.

23:06.716 --> 23:08.097
Wanna watch TV?

23:08.097 --> 23:10.510
Not a fan of
 Man Vs. Dumpster.

23:10.510 --> 23:12.472
No, there's a new
 Dance Dads on.

23:12.472 --> 23:14.474
I mean, if you wanna
watch with us.

23:16.646 --> 23:19.689
Okay. Sure.

23:23.232 --> 23:24.694
Crust?

23:24.694 --> 23:26.576
Crust sounds great.
