09:12.987 --> 09:14.423
without authorization.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.947
There's got to be
something I can do

09:16.991 --> 09:19.167
to make you guys love me
the way you used to.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.299
- Um, we never
loved you, so...

09:21.343 --> 09:25.782
- Wait! Why--why wouldn't--
why not?

09:25.826 --> 09:27.871
- We don't know what
you're talking about.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.612
- Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.222
Okay, I can't get you Myrtle,

09:31.266 --> 09:33.311
but I can get you
something better.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.879
Just get ready, okay?

09:37.751 --> 09:40.797
For the surprise!

09:40.841 --> 09:42.712
This afternoon!

09:46.934 --> 09:48.979
- I saw some kids getting
high on the markers.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.677
- Mm-hmm.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.157
- Nope, just recap the markers
when they're done.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.072
- Hey guys!
Excuse me.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.640
Um, could we just
gather around

09:57.684 --> 09:59.163
for a quick sec?

09:59.207 --> 10:02.863
Um...I know that
everyone is walking

10:02.906 --> 10:04.342
on eggshells around me.

10:04.386 --> 10:07.084
And I just want you
to know,

10:07.128 --> 10:11.132
that I am not embarrassed
that I had sex.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.482
- Oh, Amy, sure you're not,
sweetie.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.963
- You don't have to say that.
- No, I mean it!

10:16.006 --> 10:18.922
Guess what, people--
I have sex.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.142
And I like having sex.

10:21.185 --> 10:24.798
There's nothing wrong with
someone liking and having sex.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.756
- Yeah! Even a woman,
believe it or not!

10:26.800 --> 10:28.845
Take notes, young man,
the future is female.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.412
And I get it!

10:30.455 --> 10:32.022
- Okay! Well, that's it.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.981
That's all I wanted
to say, so...

10:34.024 --> 10:35.852
I'm gonna go
back to work now,

10:35.896 --> 10:39.769
and I will be thinking
about sex, if I want to.

10:39.813 --> 10:43.773
Got sex on my mind,
and my mind on my sex!

10:43.817 --> 10:47.168
Aren't you a little child?

10:47.211 --> 10:51.041
- ♪ And I don't want the world
to see me ♪

10:51.085 --> 10:54.349
♪ 'Cause I don't think
that they'd understand ♪

10:54.392 --> 10:56.394
- It doesn't matter
what the surprise is, okay?

10:56.438 --> 10:58.745
I'm not getting back together
with him. It's over.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.398
- I bet Jeff's getting us
a taco truck.

11:00.442 --> 11:03.010
- Ooh, or maybe
an ice cream truck.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.055
- Ooh, I hope it's
a pizza truck.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.231
Sorry, guys, kind of
a pizza freak.

11:07.275 --> 11:10.017
- Everyone loves pizza, so
it's not a personality trait.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.541
- Here's a crazy idea--
what if it's not a food truck?

11:12.584 --> 11:15.457
- Ooh, maybe he's gonna give
us each, like, $50.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.720
- Maybe he's planning
on murdering Mateo.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.157
Think about it,
big surprise,

11:20.201 --> 11:21.942
nobody's gonna see it coming.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.335
I mean, If anybody was gonna
snap, it'd be that guy.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.424
- Okay, so it's either a snack,

11:26.468 --> 11:29.079
an arbitrary amount of money,
or Mateo dies.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.168
I guess it's got to be
one of those three things.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.953
- Mm.
- It's got to be.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.868
- Shredder!

11:34.911 --> 11:36.347
- All right, okay.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.349
- Hey, man, this guy
shreds ass!

11:38.393 --> 11:39.437
- Sorry, I--

11:39.481 --> 11:41.178
Guys, stop, all right?

11:41.222 --> 11:42.963
You know what?
It's--it's demeaning.

11:43.006 --> 11:46.270
You guys are acting like sex
was something I did to Amy.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.576
You know,
like I conquered her.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.099
- Oh!
- Yeah, you did!

11:49.143 --> 11:51.449
- All hail J-Bone,
the conquerer!

11:51.493 --> 11:53.887
- I feel like you're grasping
on to the wrong words here.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.759
Uh, Amy was
an equal participant, okay?

11:56.803 --> 11:58.456
So all also hail Amy,

11:58.500 --> 12:01.808
the mutual intercourse
partner!

12:01.851 --> 12:03.940
- Uh...
- We'll handle the nicknames.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.768
You just keep shredding,
shredder.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.596
- Yeah.

12:07.639 --> 12:10.555
Hey, is your favorite movie
"Waking Shred Devine"?

12:10.599 --> 12:14.603
- That's what she shred.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.001
- I just wanted to say--

12:21.044 --> 12:22.480
I totally get what
you were saying before

12:22.524 --> 12:24.134
about liking sex.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.136
I think that's really cool.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.227
- Okay. Thank you.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.794
- So...

12:31.838 --> 12:34.144
do you want to,
like, do it?

12:36.886 --> 12:38.235
- I have a condom.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.498
- Oh, my God! No! No!

12:40.542 --> 12:43.153
- But you said
you like sex.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.981
- Not with you.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.376
- No, no. No. Don't--

12:48.419 --> 12:51.509
- Um, Noam, don't cry.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.033
I'm not crying.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.211
I don't even like you!

12:59.953 --> 13:00.344
.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.390
- Noam, it's okay, come out!

13:02.433 --> 13:04.479
- No. Can someone
call my mom

13:04.522 --> 13:05.872
or my stepdad's
work number?

13:05.915 --> 13:07.569
- Your mom's at the dentist,

13:07.612 --> 13:09.658
and your stepdad said
that he doesn't care.

13:09.701 --> 13:10.746
- Okay.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.401
Noam

13:13.444 --> 13:15.795
You're gonna come out
of that tent, okay, hon?

13:15.838 --> 13:19.407
Now, whether you're conscious
or unconscious is up to you.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.801
- Are you really gonna throw
a bug bomb in there?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.411
- No!

13:23.454 --> 13:24.804
Yeah, I am.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.415
- Oh, Noam assaulted Amy,

13:27.458 --> 13:28.895
and now he won't come
out of the tent.

13:28.938 --> 13:29.896
- No...

13:29.939 --> 13:31.332
it was not an assault,

13:31.375 --> 13:33.508
it was a...
misunderstanding.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.770
- Exactly!

13:34.814 --> 13:36.772
And misunderstandings
can't be assault.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.643
- Well...they can.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.863
- Yes, they can,
and they usually are.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.865
- Attention, employees--
make your way to the break room

13:42.909 --> 13:44.475
for a harassment meeting.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.260
Shoppers, go about your business.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.870
This is a private matter

13:47.914 --> 13:50.438
concerning our floor manager,
Amy, and a 14-year-old boy.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.744
- Dina, please,
can we just not?

13:52.788 --> 13:54.616
I-I was hoping to get
through my first day

13:54.659 --> 13:56.313
without a harassment meeting.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.924
- Oh, you should have started
up last Friday.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.404
We didn't need any harassment
meetings last Friday.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.928
- Perfect swish.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.800
- Hey, guys,
he's not coming out.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.934
- Well, then we can't
do this meeting. Bummer.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.806
- I got this.
Giuseppe! Alex!

14:10.850 --> 14:13.374
Giuseppe W.!
Everybody grab a corner.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.376
We're taking this bad boy
to the break room.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.595
- Hey, uh, Glenn,
should we all

14:17.639 --> 14:19.467
really be leaving the floor
during back to school?

14:19.510 --> 14:20.947
I mean, come on, that's like--

14:20.990 --> 14:22.818
that's like playing
the Super Bowl with only--

14:22.862 --> 14:24.559
uh, with fewer players

14:24.602 --> 14:26.561
than a football team
would normally have.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.954
- Good point.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.347
Okay, we'll leave
a skeleton crew.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.959
Kelly!
You're in charge.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.486
- ♪ I'm only human

14:38.529 --> 14:43.447
♪ Of flesh and blood
I'm made ♪

14:43.491 --> 14:44.448
- We'll make this quick.

14:44.492 --> 14:45.841
There was an incident

14:45.885 --> 14:48.757
relating to
a sexual proposition

14:48.800 --> 14:51.368
between Amy
and another employee.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.848
No need to name names.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.632
It was Noam.

14:54.676 --> 14:55.982
- Noam.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.680
- Oh. Hi, Noam.
- Hi.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.682
- Do you want me to get
the harassment video?

15:00.725 --> 15:02.684
- Oh, no, the old videos
don't apply anymore.

15:02.727 --> 15:06.079
We are living in a brave, new,
MeToo, Time's Up,

15:06.122 --> 15:08.124
"This Is Us" kind of world.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.691
There are no rules anymore.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.041
But also,
there's nothing but rules.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.435
- Wait.
So Amy banged Noam, too?

15:14.478 --> 15:16.567
- No!
God, no, nothing happened.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.135
- Good, 'cause he's
a child. He can't consent.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.529
- They say consent
is irrelevant.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.357
- I think you mean
"intent is irrelevant."

15:23.400 --> 15:25.925
Consent is pretty much
the whole point.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.753
- Also, she's a supervisor,
so double illegal.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.059
- So was it illegal

15:30.103 --> 15:31.756
when Amy forced Jonah
to have sex with her?

15:31.800 --> 15:34.150
- Nobody forced me
to have sex with them.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.370
- But you might have felt
like you couldn't say no

15:36.413 --> 15:37.980
because Amy was
in the power position.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.026
- Nuh-uh, Jonah
was on top.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.636
- Does it matter
who's on top?

15:41.679 --> 15:43.812
- It really doesn't.
- It really does.

15:43.855 --> 15:47.598
- I like reverse cowgirl
because there's no eye contact.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.037
- Cool info.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.431
- Does anybody know
what a "DCPI" is?

15:54.475 --> 15:58.914
Or "Quadrant 12"?
Where is Quadrant 12?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.916
Oh, Dan!

16:00.960 --> 16:03.049
Dan, are you
going to Quadrant 12?

16:03.092 --> 16:04.659
Dan!

16:06.835 --> 16:09.011
Because who MeToo'd who?

16:09.055 --> 16:11.796
I mean, Jonah's the man,
but Amy's the one in charge.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.625
- A woman can't take
advantage of a man.

16:14.669 --> 16:17.019
- Hey! Amy can force
an underling to have sex

16:17.063 --> 16:18.586
just as easily as a man!

16:18.629 --> 16:20.022
- Right!

16:20.066 --> 16:22.894
- I mean, I didn't,
and I wouldn't, but I could.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.549
- And she will.
- Yeah, that was not my point.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.942
- Hey, I'm trying really
hard to defend you,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.161
but you're making
it pretty tough.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.684
- This isn't harassment.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.860
Jonah and Amy are meant
for each other.

16:31.903 --> 16:32.948
- Then why aren't
they together?

16:34.254 --> 16:36.212
- Maybe the sex was bad.
It looked bad.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.692
- Guys, we shouldn't
be talking

16:37.735 --> 16:38.780
about this
in front of Amy.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.521
- No! That is--

16:40.564 --> 16:42.653
Okay, you guys want to talk
about what happened?

16:42.697 --> 16:43.785
Let's talk about it.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.091
What do you want to know?

16:45.134 --> 16:46.614
- Don't fall for it.
It's a trick.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.181
- No, no, no.
I'm serious!

16:48.224 --> 16:51.097
Let's just get it all out there
once and for all,

16:51.140 --> 16:54.970
and then we never have to talk
about it ever again.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.711
Bring it on!

16:56.754 --> 16:59.714
- Are you still in love
with each other?

16:59.757 --> 17:01.672
- What a stupid waste
of a first question.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.935
Who cares?
Did you have an orgasm?

17:03.979 --> 17:06.503
- Yeah, boy!
- Guys, come on!

17:06.547 --> 17:07.983
- No, it's fine,
I don't want there

17:08.027 --> 17:09.811
to be any unanswered
questions.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.943
Technically, I did
not have an orgasm.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.945
But it still felt good.
Next question.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.513
- Did Jonah have
an orgasm?

17:21.605 --> 17:22.954
- Yes, yes, I did.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.087
- "Noice"! Yeah!

17:25.131 --> 17:27.698
- No! I am not
high-fiving one man

17:27.742 --> 17:29.483
over another man's orgasm.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.659
- Stop using me
as a human shield!

17:31.702 --> 17:33.835
Cease fire! Cease fire!

17:33.878 --> 17:35.619
- Around the 14-minute mark
in the video,

17:35.663 --> 17:37.491
Jonah appeared to whisper
something to you.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.796
What did he say?

17:38.840 --> 17:40.494
- Oh, I think it was
something about

17:40.537 --> 17:42.235
the cord from the scanner
was chafing his thigh.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.714
- I knew it.

17:43.758 --> 17:44.802
- Wow.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.630
- Now, as a pregnant woman,

17:46.674 --> 17:48.850
was it weird having two people
inside of you at once?

17:48.893 --> 17:50.112
- No, not really.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.027
- Follow up on Mateo's
question--

17:52.071 --> 17:55.770
Jonah, was it weird being one
of two people inside Amy?

17:55.813 --> 17:56.945
- I didn't think
about it.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.207
- Following up on Cheyenne,

17:58.251 --> 18:00.122
is it weird thinking
about it now?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.297
- It's getting a
little weird, yeah.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.907
- Okay,
keep 'em coming, people!

18:02.951 --> 18:04.779
We'll be here
as long as it takes.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.172
- For my next question,

18:06.215 --> 18:08.696
I'm gonna need
a church candle and a bagel.

18:10.698 --> 18:11.090
.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.136
- For the first part, I would
say I don't really believe

18:14.180 --> 18:15.616
in soul mates,
more like different people

18:15.659 --> 18:18.227
for different phases of your
life type of thing.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.012
And for the second
part, circumcised.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.145
Yeah? Yeah.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.234
All right,
who's next?

18:25.278 --> 18:27.062
Anybody?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.498
Come on, guys,
don't be shy.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.675
Justine

18:31.719 --> 18:33.242
No? Okay.

18:33.286 --> 18:36.332
Noam, anything you
want to say in there?

18:36.376 --> 18:40.336
- I think he's asleep.
- Yeah, he had a big day.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.686
- All right, guys, well,
this is your last chance,

18:42.730 --> 18:45.385
'cause after today, we are
never talking about this again.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.648
Anyone?

18:47.691 --> 18:49.693
- Okay!

18:49.737 --> 18:52.653
Well, then
we are done-zo.

18:54.394 --> 18:58.093
Okay. Let's get back to work.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.183
- Actually, the store closed,
like, 15 minutes ago.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.532
- Oh.
- Come on.

19:02.576 --> 19:03.751
- Good day, everyone.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.233
- Boom.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.104
- Good stuff out there,
Miss Sue.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.541
Hey, nice hustle, Dan!

19:11.585 --> 19:14.762
So proud of us!
Love you guys!

19:14.805 --> 19:17.547
Dina! It went great!

19:17.591 --> 19:18.809
Well, not at first.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.376
At first, I got very
overwhelmed,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.465
and I started to get
this rash on my chest,

19:22.509 --> 19:24.163
but then I thought
to myself,

19:24.206 --> 19:26.382
"Kelly, girl,
you have been through

19:26.426 --> 19:28.732
Miss St. Louis,
you can handle this."

19:28.776 --> 19:31.257
And so I delegated,
and I problem-solved,

19:31.300 --> 19:34.216
and I rallied the troops,
and...

19:34.260 --> 19:35.304
I did it.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.264
- Okay.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.400
- I am Myrtle,

19:44.444 --> 19:46.620
your Cloud 9 virtual greeter.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.277
You said you wanted Myrtle,
so I got you Myrtle.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.235
Meet our new
automated greeter.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.497
Hello, Myrtle.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.196
- Welcome to Cloud 9.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.893
- This is
the big surprise?

20:00.503 --> 20:02.244
I mean, it's got over 50
programmable greetings,

20:02.288 --> 20:03.767
plus you can change
the background.

20:03.811 --> 20:04.899
She's flying.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.686
- Um, you were mad
at me about Myrtle,

20:09.730 --> 20:12.689
so this is, like,
the next best thing

20:12.733 --> 20:14.735
to having her back.

20:14.778 --> 20:18.478
I did this for you.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.611
- It's not Myrtle.
- Bye-bye now.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.701
- Wait, don't go!
Look! She's at the beach, guys!

20:24.745 --> 20:26.268
And now a snowstorm!

20:26.312 --> 20:27.530
And hang on, hang on, hang on,

20:27.574 --> 20:29.358
I can fix this,
right, real quick.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.708
Menu, function--
Guys! I can fix this!

20:31.752 --> 20:33.406
I did a good thing!

20:33.449 --> 20:36.626
- ♪ Do you really want
to hurt me?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.715
♪

20:38.759 --> 20:40.761
- Hey.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.284
- Hey.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.722
- So you made it through
your first day back.

20:45.766 --> 20:49.291
And you only
sexually harassed one teen.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.467
- Yep, took a lot
of self-control.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.774
- Uh, quick question--

20:53.817 --> 20:55.819
So many questions...

20:58.387 --> 21:00.433
- We had Italian last night.

21:00.476 --> 21:01.434
Mexican.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.522
- Okay, I'll pick it up.

21:02.565 --> 21:03.914
- I'll get the wine. Hey!

21:03.958 --> 21:05.568
- People are gonna see us.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.309
- Nobody's around!

21:13.707 --> 21:17.493
- All right.
See you soon, J-Bone.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.495
- Looking forward to it,
A-hole.
