00:03.212 --> 00:06.375
Aeryn. She's carrying my child.
My-my DNA.

00:06.465 --> 00:10.333
Aeryn isn't sure if the child
is John Crichton's.

00:10.428 --> 00:14.137
A relationship it's
based on trust.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.303
I'm so sorry.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.427
Who saved your life, who?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.133
Idid.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.809
What's he doing here?

00:20.897 --> 00:22.057
He wants asylum.

00:22.148 --> 00:23.263
Asylum?

00:23.357 --> 00:25.473
I gave my word that he
would not be harmed.

00:25.568 --> 00:26.899
Put your weapons down.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.396
Why did you come here?

00:28.487 --> 00:32.150
To safeguard John Crichton,

00:32.241 --> 00:33.902
amongst other things.

00:33.993 --> 00:37.326
I will find them again
and when I do,

00:37.413 --> 00:39.825
they will pay for this
humiliation.

00:39.916 --> 00:42.248
Distillate of Laka.

00:42.335 --> 00:45.168
One whiff, and the
pain is gone.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.162
For a time.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.634
|t'|| help you forget
about Aeryn.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.084
And now, on Farscape.

00:53.971 --> 00:57.259
Crichton:
Yo, Pilot, you there?

01:00.394 --> 01:04.307
Pilot, I got a ton of
groceries to unload.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.854
(Noranti humming)

01:05.942 --> 01:07.398
Pilot?

01:09.320 --> 01:11.151
Damn, I figured they'd
be in range.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.901
Are you eager to see the
others again?

01:13.991 --> 01:16.198
Naw, it hadn't been that long.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.658
Still, you miss Aeryn.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.831
Or don't you?

01:26.295 --> 01:29.583
Damn, it's been a few arns
since I thought about her.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.965
Then my remedy must be working.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.633
( sniffs )

01:34.720 --> 01:37.553
( sniffs )
Take it for as long
as you need it.

01:38.975 --> 01:42.513
Ah, I don't... (sniffling)
I don't need it.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.343
Just takes the edge off.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.143
Crichton?

01:48.234 --> 01:50.600
Pilot, there you are.
It's about time.

01:50.695 --> 01:53.107
Hey look, get all the hands
down to the hangar.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.903
I got a boatload of crap
for you guys.

01:54.991 --> 01:59.200
Unfortunately, nobody is
available to assist you
at the moment.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.243
Well, what are they doing?
Watching Jeopardy?

02:01.330 --> 02:02.319
( laughs )

02:02.415 --> 02:04.280
Get them off their butts.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.457
Let me talk to Captain
James T. D'Argo.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.284
( Noranti laughs)

02:08.379 --> 02:10.916
Captain James T. D'Argo!

02:11.007 --> 02:12.417
( laughs )

02:12.508 --> 02:18.174
Ka D'Argo is currently helping
Rygel with his... laundry,

02:18.264 --> 02:20.676
and Aeryn's writing some...

02:20.766 --> 02:23.303
poetry.

02:23.394 --> 02:27.012
Uh-huh. What about, ah,
Chiana and Sikozu?

02:27.106 --> 02:29.267
Enjoying each other's company.

02:29.358 --> 02:33.192
Preparing a meal for...
everyone but Rygel.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.395
He's... not hungry.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.526
Right, well tell 'em to save me
a plate. l'm starving. Pod out.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.699
Now isn't that lovely.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.118
Everyone is getting on so well?

02:43.205 --> 02:46.663
Oh, crickets.
Something's wrong.

02:46.751 --> 02:51.165
Maybe the game's not over
with or Scorpy's really
loose on the ship.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.708
Bingo.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.339
Moya's got gate crashers.

03:02.475 --> 03:06.263
(humming dramatic theme)

03:06.354 --> 03:09.221
An unprecedented reward
is offered for information

03:09.315 --> 03:12.148
leading to the capture
of John Crichton.

03:12.234 --> 03:16.147
If he is taken alive, 15 million
currency pledges. lf dead...

03:16.238 --> 03:17.489
Bay Two.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.531
Acknowledged. Prepare loading
Bay Two for landing.

03:20.618 --> 03:25.738
Crichton. I've... prepared
Bay Two for landing.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.447
Yeah, just give me a minute to
get these crates locked down.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.204
Noranti:
My mixture is ready.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.910
You sure you're gonna
be okay out there?

03:33.005 --> 03:37.123
This will keep me in a vacuum
coma for at least three arns.

03:37.218 --> 03:40.176
It's most relaxing.
You should try it sometime.

03:40.262 --> 03:44.175
No, thanks. I'm not a
big fan of vacuum.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.758
Stand ready. He'll dock
within 30 microns.

03:47.853 --> 03:48.968
Wait.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.803
His approach vector's wrong.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.604
Evacuate our boarding craft.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.397
We're coming under attack.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.817
Full defensive alert.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.651
(groaning)

04:06.122 --> 04:10.035
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:10.126 --> 04:13.618
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.543
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

04:15.631 --> 04:18.839
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

04:18.926 --> 04:20.666
my friends.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.548
I've made enemies.

04:23.639 --> 04:26.881
Powerful, dangerous.

04:26.976 --> 04:30.468
Now all I want is to
find a way home

04:30.563 --> 04:33.305
to warn Earth.

04:33.399 --> 04:38.484
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.137
He's destroyed our
boarding craft.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.139
I begin to see why his
bounty's so high.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.516
Keep searching all tiers.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.314
He's aboard somewhere.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.813
Nobody could have survived
that explosion.

05:19.904 --> 05:21.360
Crichton must be dead.

05:21.447 --> 05:25.110
Prakl Crichton's alive.

05:25.201 --> 05:27.362
And ingenious.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.336
(sighs)

05:47.973 --> 05:51.340
Tier nine clear,
moving to tier ten.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.851
( beeping )

05:54.939 --> 05:56.304
(zapping)

05:56.398 --> 05:58.309
Who the frell are you?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.810
Your captor.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.234
Only temporarily.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.232
Let's not prolong this.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.405
Tell Crichton to come
to the Command.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.107
Tell him yourself.

06:08.202 --> 06:11.160
The longer it takes for me
to capture Crichton,

06:11.247 --> 06:14.205
the greater the likelihood that
one of you will be damaged.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.328
Well, there's no likelihood
we're going to help you.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.410
You're certain you
won't cooperate?

06:19.505 --> 06:23.965
Why don't you undo these cuffs
and just see how much
I wanna cooperate?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.417
(zapping)

06:26.512 --> 06:28.173
Aeryn:
Leave him alone.
You gain nothing.

06:28.264 --> 06:33.258
Axikor:
Probably, but it
costs me nothing.

06:33.352 --> 06:37.345
I could improve those
hideous Luxan features.

06:37.439 --> 06:41.978
That would be messier than
pain cuffs, but far more
entertaining.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.854
( beeps )
Crichton, surrender at once.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.031
You won't be harmed.

06:49.118 --> 06:51.325
We want you alive.

06:51.412 --> 06:56.202
But if you resist, we'll take
it out on your shipmates.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.907
( beeps )
Like so.

06:58.002 --> 07:00.709
(zapping)
(grunts)

07:00.796 --> 07:04.038
Bintog:
Sir, nothing can be salvaged
of our boarding craft.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.249
Shall I re-enable one of the
Transport Pods?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.676
Axikor:
No. It's slow and weaponless.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.505
We'd be a target for every other
bounty hunter in the sector.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.388
Bintog:
I'll send a transmission
to the Command Carrier requesting pickup.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.264
Axikor:
It's too soon.

07:18.355 --> 07:22.314
We'll tell Grayza to come for
us only when we have
captured Crichton.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.811
As you wish.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.358
(inhales)

07:26.780 --> 07:28.645
(sniffling)

07:33.287 --> 07:35.323
( sniffles )

07:35.414 --> 07:37.405
SHence.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.332
( heartbeat )

07:43.839 --> 07:45.375
You have something?

07:45.466 --> 07:47.252
Maybe.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.340
( beeping )
( heartbeats )

07:52.431 --> 07:55.138
( breathing heavily)

07:57.269 --> 07:59.055
Aeryn,

07:59.146 --> 08:02.263
you know what, I think
we should negotiate.

08:02.358 --> 08:05.225
No, I really think we
should negotiate.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.559
Right.

08:06.654 --> 08:10.988
(all speaking alien
language loudly)

08:12.534 --> 08:14.365
SHence!

08:19.667 --> 08:21.123
(grunts)

08:21.210 --> 08:24.543
It's no good. He's gone.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.042
But we know he's in the ducts.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.123
Bintog:
We could pursue him up there.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.675
Axikor:
Only by making ourselves
too vulnerable.

08:31.762 --> 08:35.926
No, we'll draw him out.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.136
Bring him to us.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.092
Search this Tier.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.347
Mm-hmm.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.560
You know your comrade.

08:45.651 --> 08:49.269
Tell me which one of you
does he care for most?

08:49.363 --> 08:52.730
(Rygel laughs):
Me, of course.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.281
(growling)

08:54.368 --> 08:57.030
( beeping )

08:57.121 --> 08:59.658
Aeryn, of course, probably
Chiana next.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.704
Where will Crichton go now?

09:01.792 --> 09:06.206
Center Chamber for a
nice, hot raslak.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.832
( beeping )

09:07.923 --> 09:09.879
He'll go to his quarters,
gather all his weapons.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.083
That Tarkan Shield Belt
should help the odds.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.293
Then he'll head for
Pilot's Den.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.050
What are you staring at,
Drennak?

09:17.141 --> 09:18.972
Axikor:
Find Crichton's quarters.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.846
Search for weapons and a
shielding device.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.269
Devvak:
Crichton's quarters.
Acknowledged.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.597
Axikor:
He'll also try to
free the pilot.

09:26.692 --> 09:29.354
Isn't that right, Crichton?

09:31.280 --> 09:34.317
Secure the Pilot's Den.
Be ready.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.615
Got it.

09:36.702 --> 09:41.617
Hey, if I could distract him,
can you make a break for it?

09:41.707 --> 09:43.447
You know, that run on walls
trick thing?

09:43.542 --> 09:47.330
Ya know? Go hide in the
Neural Cluster or something?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.707
Not with these frelling
cuffs on, I can't.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.334
These what cuffs?

09:51.425 --> 09:55.509
( laughs ):
I am so glad we extended
your vocabulary.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.967
Listen.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.389
( quietly):
Play along.

10:01.477 --> 10:03.342
Oh, okay.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.895
l have a very compelling
argument for letting us go.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.142
Hey.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.269
Soldier boy. Come here.

10:11.945 --> 10:16.029
Hey, don't you get hot
in that armor?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.323
( breathing )

10:19.411 --> 10:21.743
Are you trying to entice me?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.366
Maybe.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.247
If I wanted you.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.245
I'd take you.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.873
Should I show you?
-Yeah.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.043
Sikozu:
Leave her alone.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.166
Fiskro:
Or maybe both of you.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.213
Pilot:
No, please! Don't hurt them.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.290
Quiet.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.216
(zapping)
(grunting)

10:38.305 --> 10:39.135
( heartbeats )

10:39.223 --> 10:42.966
( heartbeats )
( beeping )

10:50.108 --> 10:52.190
(grunting)

10:52.277 --> 10:53.562
( draws weapon )

11:02.246 --> 11:07.115
(humming dramatic theme)

11:13.298 --> 11:15.038
(communicator chirping)

11:15.133 --> 11:17.590
Report. Any sign of Crichton?

11:17.678 --> 11:21.421
Devvak:
I'm in his quarters.
He hasn't come near.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.758
(whispering ):
Scorp?

11:39.658 --> 11:43.526
Scorpius, you son of a bitch.

11:51.837 --> 11:57.423
( raspy breathing )

12:03.015 --> 12:05.301
( exhales )

12:14.276 --> 12:15.186
1812.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.142
(electronic chirping)

12:17.237 --> 12:19.148
( chuckles )

12:19.239 --> 12:23.448
Playing possum, huh?
( squeaking )

12:23.535 --> 12:26.151
You think you can get any of
your brothers up and running?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.783
( squeaking )

12:28.874 --> 12:30.239
Good boy.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.167
( squeaking )
Be quiet, though.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.993
No singing.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.125
I'm gonna go scrounge up
a blunderbuss.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.205
(growling)

12:39.301 --> 12:40.416
D'Argo:
Oh, relax.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.762
You'll see Crichton
sooner or later.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.337
A microt before he kills you.

12:45.432 --> 12:49.766
I admire such confidence from
the weak and helpless.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.138
(electronic zapping )

12:54.232 --> 12:57.190
(soft metallic clattering )

13:01.740 --> 13:03.105
Scorpius:
John.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.951
I'm not your enemy. Be calm.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.369
Oh, I'm calm.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.163
I'm just a little twitchy
'cause, uh, you sold us out.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.786
Nothing of the kind.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.038
What, it's just coinkidink
you're running on the loose?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.337
The only reason I escaped
capture is because the bounty
hunters do not know I'm here.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.801
By the time they went to
my cell l was not in it.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.466
Now how'd that happen?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.636
Oh, I know, I know.
We forgot to lock the door.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.305
The cell door was wholly
inadequate.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.846
What you saying?

13:31.937 --> 13:33.802
You opened it with your
bare hands?

13:33.897 --> 13:36.138
Gloved hands, yes.

13:36.233 --> 13:40.226
You mean you could've got out
anytime you wanted?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.437
I never wanted to.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.863
But by the time our attackers
arrived, I had to.

13:48.954 --> 13:53.493
Whoever they are, they have
managed to capture Moya's crew
in a matter of microts.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.835
But they must not capture you.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.743
ldon't cut and run.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.921
We could not run if we wished.

14:01.008 --> 14:05.217
They've immobilized all escape
craft with magnetic locks,

14:05.303 --> 14:07.259
And disabled the DRDs,
all except for that one.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.506
He's not from Moya.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.559
But if he restarts the others,
we'll have more firepower.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.637
Don't have time for that.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.563
I'm going...

14:18.650 --> 14:20.186
wabbit hunting.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.394
You can't take them
all at once.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.275
How dumb do you think I am?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.403
You take 'em down one by one,
the Die Hard way.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.531
By luring them into an ambush.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.951
You could do with some
assistance.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.374
( clicking )

14:37.461 --> 14:40.294
You really think our
relationship...

14:40.380 --> 14:41.836
has progressed that far?

14:50.265 --> 14:53.257
Just remember whose
side you're on.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.353
(communicator chirping)

14:59.441 --> 15:02.183
This is John Crichton,
paging the head Cylon.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.938
Pick up the phone,
lmperious Leader.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.189
Crichton.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.145
How pleasant to hear from you.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.526
Let's have a little chat.
First off, money.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.984
We can pay you more than
the Peacekeepers will.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.286
No deal.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.078
Surrender at once.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.201
And why would I do that?

15:17.292 --> 15:20.250
To reduce the suffering of
your crewmates.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.168
It's the only choice you have.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.088
Don't doubt for a microt that
you will be captured.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.712
You know, for a guy with no
mouth you sure talk big.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.213
Brilliant.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.920
Why don't you come down here
and find me, Gort?

15:32.015 --> 15:34.176
Klaatu barada niktu.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.882
Mission accomplished, John.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.478
Screw you.

15:37.562 --> 15:41.020
Axikor:
He's on a lower tier, somewhere
in the atmospheric system.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.224
Check all the airflow chambers.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.980
(rhythmic whirring )

15:54.955 --> 15:57.037
Scorpius:
Are you looking for someone?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.206
(fizzled zapping )
( beeping )

15:59.960 --> 16:01.325
( scoffs )

16:01.419 --> 16:03.410
Thank you, John.

16:04.256 --> 16:06.167
(grunting)

16:07.634 --> 16:11.092
Como estas, la cucaracha.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.893
(chuckling)

16:22.524 --> 16:23.684
( sniffs )

16:25.944 --> 16:28.606
( loud thud )

16:28.697 --> 16:30.813
You didn't expect me to give ya
a loaded weapon, did ya?

16:30.907 --> 16:32.238
Scorpius:
Well, yes.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.941
Let's have a look at this guy.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.539
Damn, what the hell's this?

16:44.629 --> 16:47.211
(squishy noises)

16:47.299 --> 16:50.257
It's like... Mr. Pumpkinhead.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.004
Organic core.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.961
Bioengineered armor shell.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.139
Crunchy on the outside, chewy on
the inside. How are your ribs?

16:58.226 --> 17:02.094
As if you cared.
My armor worked, barely.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.224
One down.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.475
Five to go.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.147
And you have a weapon
that works.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.850
Nope, this bazooka's
out of ammo.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.728
You can have it.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.866
I may well have joined
the wrong side.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.869
Dead? How?

17:19.956 --> 17:23.790
Multiple blasts from a
large-yield weapon.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.745
So. Crichton's more formidable
than I thought.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.296
I told you, but would
you listen?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.669
No. They never listen.

17:32.761 --> 17:36.049
Not too late to cut your
losses and run.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.596
Oh, it's still early.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.849
Initiate the containment plan.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.224
All right, I got Wynonna,
an extra Pulse Pistol,

17:48.318 --> 17:50.229
two Pulse Rifles,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.561
two DRDs, maybe four.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.648
Eight, 16, or 64,
it won't be enough.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.575
Well, there's always the pulse
chamber overload trick.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.074
If you can lure them
close enough.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.907
I'm gonna need a volunteer
for a dangerous mission.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.583
(DRD squeaking)

18:07.671 --> 18:09.627
The torment continues.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.375
( squeaking )

18:11.466 --> 18:13.548
No one asked you.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.878
You, get to your feet.

18:19.975 --> 18:23.183
Pilot:
What are you going to
do with them?

18:23.270 --> 18:26.262
I told you to be silent.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.063
( beeping )

18:32.445 --> 18:34.276
( beeping continues)

18:37.200 --> 18:39.316
(device charging)

18:52.215 --> 18:54.046
(groaning)

18:54.134 --> 18:56.250
( beeping )

18:57.554 --> 18:59.419
What the frell?

18:59.514 --> 19:01.220
Axikor:
Get up.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.679
(sighs)

19:04.769 --> 19:07.101
We re not going for a little
walk, are we?

19:07.188 --> 19:08.223
Something like that.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.271
Hey, hey, frellnik.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.896
Uh, before you do whatever
you've got in mind, let's talk.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.150
If this is about currency,
I assure you that I can
more than match

19:17.240 --> 19:20.073
whatever you're being
paid for me.
( grunts )

19:20.160 --> 19:20.990
(grunting)

19:21.077 --> 19:22.283
( D'Argo hissing )

19:24.456 --> 19:25.161
(grunting)

19:25.248 --> 19:26.658
(growling)

19:26.750 --> 19:28.206
Aah!

19:30.337 --> 19:33.204
Delivering you dead
would cost me,

19:33.298 --> 19:36.290
but it mightjust be worth it.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.215
( beeping )

19:40.221 --> 19:42.132
(device charging)

20:04.996 --> 20:06.372
( beeping )

20:08.124 --> 20:11.366
Tell Crichton what you
just witnessed.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.332
Crichton, don't talk,
just listen.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.838
They've somehow reduced
D'Argo in size.

20:20.929 --> 20:24.217
He's alive, but he's no larger
than a hand length,

20:24.307 --> 20:27.299
and he's imprisoned inside
the head bounty hunter.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.181
And the rest of your crewmates
will follow.

20:30.271 --> 20:33.138
So put away your weaponry.

20:33.233 --> 20:37.192
Killing one of us means you'll
be killing one or more
of your friends.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.018
Do you understand?

20:39.114 --> 20:41.230
Aeryn's right. Don't answer.
Keep them guessing.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.406
You see how hopeless it is?

20:43.493 --> 20:45.449
Face the inevitable.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.619
Give yourself up.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.281
( beeping )

20:51.376 --> 20:54.038
Crichton, the device appears
to be activated by

20:54.129 --> 20:56.120
a combination of numbers
on the handset.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.170
(device buzzing )

20:59.759 --> 21:02.045
I'm told you care for her.

21:02.137 --> 21:06.221
So stop fighting and you'll
save her life.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.674
You can't even consider
giving up.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.885
Grayza will not let
any of you live.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.096
I'm not giving up. And you're
the one that looks like crap.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.646
Oh, don't worry about me.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.269
I'm merely overheating.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.102
So we've gone from Die Hard to
Honey, I Shrunk the Hostages.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.777
Unless that guy is
bluffing Aeryn.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.196
ldon't think so.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.148
Forgive me. My mind isn't clear,

21:25.243 --> 21:29.282
but I seem to recall a
Peacekeeper file about a
species called the Coreeshi.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.158
These are our pumpkin people?

21:31.249 --> 21:32.409
Oh, yes.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.832
Capable of constructing organic
shells in various forms.

21:34.919 --> 21:40.459
They also were reputed to
possess reduction technology.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.256
Great.

21:42.343 --> 21:45.506
So now I've gotta take these
guys down and I can't hurt 'em.

21:45.597 --> 21:47.553
I'm sure that point is a bluff.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.758
To keep their prisoners alive
containment must be almost
impossible to damage.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.593
Can't take that chance.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.224
( scoffs )

21:55.315 --> 21:57.397
Is there another choice?

21:57.484 --> 21:58.974
( snoring )

21:59.068 --> 22:00.899
Wake up.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.444
Hynerian, wake up!

22:03.531 --> 22:06.318
My name isn't Hynerian.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.320
It's Rygel the Sixteenth.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.823
You may call me Dominar.

22:10.914 --> 22:14.327
This is scarcely the time
to obsess about how
you're addressed.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.041
Look around you.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.243
One more prison.

22:18.338 --> 22:22.672
So what? I've seen far worse.

22:22.759 --> 22:26.251
Do you have any idea
how small you are?

22:26.346 --> 22:29.554
You're not exactly a
giant yourself.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.723
You have been reduced in size.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.596
You're hardly bigger than
a filima bug now.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.642
Except”

22:39.734 --> 22:41.065
except this can't be happening.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.438
(sighing ):
Can't it?

22:44.739 --> 22:46.354
No.

22:48.076 --> 22:49.191
No.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.402
Reduction by proportionally
subtracting atoms

22:52.497 --> 22:55.159
would leave our brains
too simple to function.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.333
So, maybe theyjust made
all our atoms smaller.

22:58.419 --> 23:03.209
But then we couldn't breathe
normal size air molecules,
don't you see?

23:03.508 --> 23:05.089
No.

23:05.176 --> 23:09.590
No, this... this isn't
happening because it
is not possible.

23:09.681 --> 23:12.138
Your brain isn't functioning.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.932
Do you think this is all
just a hallucination?

23:15.019 --> 23:18.603
Do you like that explanation
better, hmm?

23:18.690 --> 23:20.271
No.

23:20.358 --> 23:24.101
But I simply cannot
comprehend how that...
-Neither can I.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.355
Who cares?

23:25.446 --> 23:28.153
We're here, they did it,
and that's that.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.823
You consider yourself
intelligent?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.154
Yes, I do.

23:33.246 --> 23:37.285
Then stop behaving
like a child.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.331
lam not a child!

23:39.419 --> 23:41.080
No, you're an infant.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.627
You've studied, but you
haven't experienced.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.047
You know nothing of life.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.419
And you do?

23:47.510 --> 23:51.344
I've been around long enough
to know how ignorant I am.

23:51.431 --> 23:55.094
I don't assume the universe
obeys my preconceptions.

23:55.184 --> 23:59.598
Hal But I know a frelling fact
when it hits me in the face.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.352
That's good work.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.944
You're smoking.

24:12.035 --> 24:13.491
You know that's not
good for you.

24:13.578 --> 24:17.491
The replacement cooling rod
Sikozu has formulated

24:17.582 --> 24:20.619
does not function as well
in times of exertion.

24:20.710 --> 24:23.247
Then don't exert.
Hit the bench. Go on.

24:23.338 --> 24:26.171
How did you survive this far?

24:28.343 --> 24:31.961
Charm. Good looks.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.171
A winning attitude.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.840
Here we go.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.512
And batter up.

24:42.607 --> 24:46.896
1812, don't cut it loose till
I give you the signal.

24:46.986 --> 24:52.822
I'm hearing something on
Tier 16, treblin side.

24:52.909 --> 24:53.773
I'll check it out.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.108
Axikor:
Negative.

24:55.203 --> 24:57.159
Hold position.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.498
Devvak, you go in first.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.698
Acknowledged.

25:15.473 --> 25:17.680
Come out, Crichton.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.725
l have Aeryn and Chiana.

25:20.812 --> 25:25.055
If you destroy me,
you destroy them.

25:25.149 --> 25:29.313
And you certainly won't
destroy me with that.

25:37.829 --> 25:40.320
Pulse chamber overload.

25:40.415 --> 25:42.497
Hmm. Not very creative.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.039
Crichton:
1812.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.209
(gurgles)

25:47.296 --> 25:50.333
Bear trap. Ugly but creative.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.172
And that is how we survived.

25:55.263 --> 25:58.255
The containment capsule is here.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.214
1812, light it up.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.269
What's that? What's going on?

26:05.356 --> 26:07.347
Contact lost on Tier 16.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.979
All hands get down there now.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.484
There's no more time. Take this.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.031
Aeryn:
We're out.
Crichton's got us out.

26:25.126 --> 26:26.206
Aeryn, Pip, you okay?

26:26.294 --> 26:27.249
Oh, yeah.
-Yes.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.166
Fiskro:
Over here.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.369
Run for it! Save them!

26:29.464 --> 26:30.670
1812. This way.
-Whoal

26:30.757 --> 26:32.293
Pick it up. Pick it up!

26:33.760 --> 26:35.546
Go, John. Go!

26:43.978 --> 26:45.934
Who is he?

26:46.022 --> 26:47.853
Do you think he's
worth anything?

26:47.940 --> 26:50.431
Either he's worth something,

26:50.526 --> 26:51.936
or he's dead.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.271
Crichton:
Are you guys all right?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.777
Where are we? I can't see.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.529
You're out of the bounty
hunter's body.

27:00.620 --> 27:04.112
But you're still tiny, and
you're stuck in the beer can.

27:04.207 --> 27:07.324
And since these cuffs are
magnetic, we're not going
anywhere in a hurry.

27:07.418 --> 27:09.704
Right. First priority, we get
you guys out of there.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.752
No, first priority is
rescuing the others.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.454
We can wait.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.375
Right.

27:18.221 --> 27:20.257
Gonna need a new plan.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.182
I'm on it.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.430
Axikor:
Crichton.

27:27.522 --> 27:31.265
Congratulations on retrieving
the females.

27:31.359 --> 27:35.068
I assume they're alive
and intact.

27:35.154 --> 27:41.275
Of course, you can't set them
free nor restore their size
without my help.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.109
I understand you care for them.

27:43.204 --> 27:45.365
I offer a deal.

27:45.456 --> 27:49.449
Turn yourself in and I'll
restore their size and
set them free.

27:49.544 --> 27:52.251
Hey, why are you suddenly
feeling so generous?

27:52.338 --> 27:55.751
You're costing me
bodies and time.

27:55.842 --> 28:01.337
I'll pass up the bounties
I'd earn on the females
in exchange for you.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.261
And what about the others?

28:03.349 --> 28:05.135
I'm not that generous.

28:05.226 --> 28:09.890
Maybe you'll feel more generous
after you've lost a few pints
of your own blood.

28:09.981 --> 28:12.393
(soft, menacing growl )

28:14.235 --> 28:15.941
You know where the others are?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.689
Chiana:
I saw Sikozu get shrunk

28:17.780 --> 28:19.065
but I didn't see where
they put her.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.067
Aeryn:
Same for D'Argo and Rygel.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.570
I... I used my visions.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.744
Everything slowed down and
I know... I know how they
do the shrinking.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.748
How's that?

28:30.835 --> 28:33.827
The armor. Left arm.
There's a keypad.

28:33.921 --> 28:37.709
I know the codes for shrinking,
and I... I know the codes to
get the cuffs off.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.337
Crichton:
That's good work, Chi.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.760
It's too bad we don't have some
of that armor ourselves.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.838
Mmm.
-What do we have?

28:44.932 --> 28:47.639
We got you, me,
a couple of DRDs

28:47.727 --> 28:50.264
and some weapons that only
tickle the bad guys.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.146
What happened to the old woman?

28:58.487 --> 29:00.569
Any idea who he is?

29:00.656 --> 29:02.442
No.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.024
He was working with Crichton?

29:05.119 --> 29:08.111
He's the only reason
Crichton got away.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.866
Crichton was hit in the leg.

29:09.957 --> 29:12.699
He was leaking vital fluids
in the passageway.

29:12.793 --> 29:18.129
If you can't capture a wounded
target, you'll be leaking
vital fluids as well.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.921
Get moving!

29:28.768 --> 29:30.304
Well, well.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.886
Scorpius.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.181
How's the ride?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.107
Aeryn:
We're all right.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.356
I'm still blind.

29:42.657 --> 29:45.319
Maybe... maybe it
won't go away.

29:45.409 --> 29:48.367
It's okay. Your sight's always
come back before.

29:49.372 --> 29:50.737
Maybe this is one time too many.

29:50.831 --> 29:54.244
What... what if it
doesn't come back?

29:54.335 --> 29:58.123
Well, using your sight the way
you did may be the only thing
that saves us.

29:58.214 --> 30:01.081
Without those codes we'll never
return to normal size.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.386
It's just the dark.

30:06.263 --> 30:09.175
You don't know what's coming,
and, uh...

30:09.266 --> 30:11.518
there's nothing you can do.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.304
I hate that feeling.

30:16.399 --> 30:17.388
Axikor:
Wake up.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.223
(zapping)

30:20.361 --> 30:21.771
(gasping)

30:22.697 --> 30:24.904
Why are you here?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.323
Because you captured me.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.820
(speaking alien language)

30:32.915 --> 30:34.871
So, you know.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.950
Did you think that armor
would fool me?

30:38.713 --> 30:40.249
I know what you are.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.126
Then you should bow down.

30:43.217 --> 30:47.005
Entropy will claim the universe
before I bow down to a Scarran.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.883
Even one of the Ruling Order?

30:51.434 --> 30:54.221
Particularly the Ruling Order.

30:55.479 --> 31:00.394
Grafting yourself into
Coreeshi exoskeleton?

31:00.484 --> 31:02.315
How ingenious.

31:02.403 --> 31:04.314
Yes.

31:04.405 --> 31:08.273
How many Peacekeepers have
dealt with you not knowing
you were a Scarran spy?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.278
Too many to count.

31:10.369 --> 31:14.157
You're not after Crichton
for the bounty.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.785
You want to take him back
to your masters.

31:16.876 --> 31:21.119
We're eager to learn why both
you and Commandant Grayza

31:21.213 --> 31:23.795
are so interested in him.

31:23.883 --> 31:29.594
But capturing you is a bonus
beyond measure.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.514
It shall be my honor to return
you to your birthplace.

31:33.601 --> 31:37.389
It will be my honor to
see you dead.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.516
Not likely.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.145
( charging )

31:55.706 --> 31:57.571
Ka-tow! Ka-tow! Uh!

31:57.666 --> 32:00.157
Yeah. That's gonna work.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.241
All right.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.123
I got the plan.
How's my breath?

32:03.214 --> 32:05.079
(rapid, audible breathing)
( groans )

32:05.174 --> 32:07.210
Death by laser guillotine.

32:07.301 --> 32:09.838
Four DRDs, clothesline
the suckers.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.136
And not harm their captives?

32:12.223 --> 32:13.429
Might work.

32:13.516 --> 32:14.801
Probably won't.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.508
Don't be small-minded.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.843
Chiana, how are the peepers?

32:18.938 --> 32:21.350
Chiana:
Good. Making out colors
and shapes.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.352
Right. Well, you two talk
amongst yourselves.
I got work to do.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.058
( screeching )

32:26.153 --> 32:27.233
Crichton!
-Faster!

32:27.321 --> 32:30.154
Sorry about that.

32:30.241 --> 32:33.483
Enjoy the ride, Scorpius.

32:36.038 --> 32:41.123
Ka D'Argo, overcome your
lethargy now.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.496
Moya's crew is in danger.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.206
Where the frell are we and
what are you doing here?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.417
You have a Comms?

32:51.512 --> 32:53.969
Signal Crichton immediately.

32:54.056 --> 32:56.172
Answers first.

32:56.267 --> 33:00.601
(humming tune)

33:00.688 --> 33:01.643
All right.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.015
All the brothers down
with the plan?

33:03.107 --> 33:04.893
(chirping)
Be quiet.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.645
How my little inaction figures?

33:06.735 --> 33:10.023
I can see, but it's...
it's all blurry.

33:10.114 --> 33:12.981
Right. If I get the time,
I'll do something about that.

33:13.075 --> 33:15.282
After I release two
of your arms,

33:15.369 --> 33:20.534
you'll open an encoded channel
on a vector and frequency
I designate.

33:20.624 --> 33:23.115
If you do anything else,

33:23.210 --> 33:27.920
I'll kill you and then
this Leviathan.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.918
I'll do as you say.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.508
( beeeping )

33:34.430 --> 33:37.046
A Scarran spy?

33:37.141 --> 33:39.052
He intends to capture Crichton.

33:39.143 --> 33:41.350
Not for the Peacekeepers,
but for the Scarrans.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.268
Crichton needs to know this.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.095
He cannot fall into
Scarran hands.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.146
Why should I believe you?

33:46.233 --> 33:51.102
(Axikor speaking Scarran )

33:51.197 --> 33:52.778
Wait.

33:53.616 --> 33:56.323
Scarran military code.

33:56.410 --> 34:01.495
He's signaling to a Dreadnought,
to come get him and
his prisoners.

34:01.582 --> 34:03.823
Bounty hunters may have
spared Moya.

34:03.918 --> 34:06.204
The Scarrans won't.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.081
(sighs)

34:08.172 --> 34:09.582
John?

34:09.673 --> 34:11.413
John, can you hear me?
-Yeah.

34:11.508 --> 34:12.964
Hidey ho, D. Where are you?

34:13.052 --> 34:14.758
I'm fine, in some sort of
cylindrical prison.

34:14.845 --> 34:17.962
Look, it doesn't matter.
Can you trust Scorpius?

34:18.057 --> 34:20.469
More today than yesterday. Why?

34:20.559 --> 34:23.175
He thinks we might have a
Scarran on our hands.

34:23.270 --> 34:26.182
And that the Scarran's calling
in a Dreadnought.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.309
Interesting.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.186
That could be useful.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.653
Thanks.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.979
John, the Scarran's forcing
Pilot to transmit the
message now.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.360
Crichton:
Right. Keep me posted.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.076
Found him.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.872
Cargo Bay, Tier 20.

34:44.959 --> 34:46.995
I've got treblin side.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.826
You take hamman side.

34:48.921 --> 34:51.253
Watch for traps.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.705
Almost in position.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.631
Go in ten microts.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.546
(door whirring )

35:14.780 --> 35:15.690
(whirring )

35:15.781 --> 35:17.362
(low grumbling)

35:17.449 --> 35:19.280
Oh, crap.

35:19.368 --> 35:20.949
Best laid plans.

35:22.079 --> 35:23.114
Oh.

35:23.205 --> 35:24.615
(grunting)

35:24.707 --> 35:26.572
Oh hell, this is gonna hurt.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.407
(grunting)

35:34.842 --> 35:36.082
We've got Crichton.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.131
Tier 20.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.379
Cargo Bay.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.335
Axikor:
Hold him there.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.217
I'll come shortly.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.345
No acknowledgment of my signal?

35:45.436 --> 35:46.516
Not yet.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.218
What was that?

35:48.314 --> 35:50.555
They... they said they
had Crichton.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.310
Maybe it's part of the trap.

35:52.401 --> 35:55.393
I hope it's part of the trap.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.609
Henchmen.

35:59.700 --> 36:03.363
Always the last to know and
the first to get hurt.

36:03.454 --> 36:04.819
Got some bad news for you guys.

36:04.913 --> 36:07.120
Your, uh, boss.

36:07.207 --> 36:09.072
He's not a battlebot.
He's a Scarran.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.453
Ridiculous.

36:10.544 --> 36:12.375
Yeah? Well take the can opener
to him, find out for yourself.

36:12.463 --> 36:15.205
But you better do it quick,
because he's just called
for a Dreadnought

36:15.299 --> 36:17.836
to take him back to
Scarranburg.

36:18.761 --> 36:20.752
All right.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.337
Go check it out.
He's in Pilot's Den right now.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.182
Well, why don't you have Pilot
play back the message,

36:27.269 --> 36:30.557
and you can have your chief
explain why he's talking
in Scarran.

36:32.733 --> 36:34.143
Fellas,

36:34.234 --> 36:36.896
I got no axe to grind.

36:36.987 --> 36:40.150
Peacekeepers, Scarrans,
I'm dead either way.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.358
You guys, crap, man.
You oughta be concerned.

36:45.746 --> 36:48.408
What's it gonna cost you
to check it out?

36:48.499 --> 36:50.410
Nothing.

36:50.501 --> 36:53.288
If I'm lying, you can take it
out of my hide.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.745
But if I'm telling the truth,

36:56.924 --> 36:58.915
yeah, we're gonna smoke
the peace pipe.

36:59.009 --> 37:01.216
Watch him.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.926
Axikor.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.604
What are you doing here?

37:14.691 --> 37:16.147
Open your armor.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.475
Why?

37:17.569 --> 37:21.107
To prove you're a Coreeshi
and not a Scarran.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.157
Don't be foolish.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.829
Open it.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.326
Now!

37:39.091 --> 37:40.422
Aah.

37:45.222 --> 37:47.634
Man, I hope you guys are
still under warranty.

37:47.724 --> 37:50.261
(liquid dripping)

37:56.233 --> 37:58.189
1812, get these arms off, quick.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.268
(whirring )

38:00.362 --> 38:02.148
You killed him.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.570
You can be next.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.569
( beeping )

38:06.660 --> 38:08.321
Transmission?

38:08.412 --> 38:09.447
Yes.

38:09.538 --> 38:10.698
Scarran:
Axikor.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.620
Mra zenab prant kebof...

38:12.708 --> 38:14.414
Crichton:
That a girl.

38:14.501 --> 38:18.164
All right, Chiana, start
teaching me those combinations.

38:18.255 --> 38:19.415
Will do.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.373
Scarran:
...jarj branek vol skarn...

38:24.428 --> 38:26.669
The Dreadnought signals that it
won't risk traveling to Moya.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.924
Not with a Command Carrier
in the area.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.176
That's good.

38:30.267 --> 38:31.803
He's been ordered to make
his own way off Moya,

38:31.894 --> 38:34.886
and to rendezvous with the
Dreadnought elsewhere.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.481
Well, that's bad.

38:45.032 --> 38:47.114
Oh, God, it's still warm.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.985
Okay.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.788
Uh, nurse, I am, uh,
ready for surgery.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.036
First thing, the cuffs.

38:59.213 --> 39:01.204
(electronic zapping )

39:01.298 --> 39:02.253
So far, so good.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.205
Excellent.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.211
(grunting)

39:08.764 --> 39:09.799
Oh.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.006
Beer can's next.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.474
Damn. No winners there.

39:29.326 --> 39:30.566
Hey!

39:30.661 --> 39:33.027
Crichton!
-How about that?
I got a tadpole.

39:33.121 --> 39:36.113
Crichton, get us out of here.
Make us normal size.

39:36.208 --> 39:36.958
Please!

39:37.042 --> 39:38.623
Don't know about that, Rygel.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.622
Chiana only gave me the codes
for making things smaller,
not bigger.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.578
I don't wanna blow you up.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.129
D'Argo:
John. John, we're on
the move again.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.006
I think the Scarran's trying
to make a run for it.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.304
He may try and steal 3
Transport Pod.

39:52.391 --> 39:55.224
Actually, if he wants something
faster, he might try and steal
Aeryn's Prowler.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.470
Frell.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.847
Right. I'll try to cut him
off at the pass.

39:57.938 --> 40:00.270
1812, keep an eye on
the little people.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.514
(whirring )

40:02.609 --> 40:05.476
He'll never beat the Scarran
to the Prowler.

40:06.446 --> 40:07.777
Hey, where are ya going?

40:07.864 --> 40:09.320
Sit tight.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.917
(grunts)

40:35.684 --> 40:36.764
Yo!

40:36.852 --> 40:38.433
Aeryn:
Crichton!

40:38.520 --> 40:40.101
I'll disable the Prowler.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.564
You take care of the Scarran.

40:43.442 --> 40:44.727
Fire!

40:46.737 --> 40:47.852
(grumbles)

41:16.391 --> 41:19.383
Crichton:
You should pick on somebody
your own size.

41:24.733 --> 41:25.267
Hiya, fellas.

41:25.359 --> 41:26.314
(grunting)

41:27.402 --> 41:28.232
D'Argo:
John!

41:28.320 --> 41:29.560
Whoa! John!

41:29.655 --> 41:31.816
Axikor:
Crichton. Excellent.

41:31.907 --> 41:35.445
Scorpius will have someone to
keep him company on his journey.

41:38.455 --> 41:40.161
Where? Back to Scarranburg?

41:40.248 --> 41:41.374
ldon't think so.

41:43.210 --> 41:44.165
Get big code.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.117
You're mine now.

41:46.213 --> 41:47.248
Crap.

41:47.339 --> 41:48.579
I hope I can do this.

41:49.716 --> 41:51.252
(grunting)

41:57.391 --> 41:58.380
(grunting)

41:58.475 --> 42:00.090
So, you're an upper-class
Scarran?

42:00.185 --> 42:02.927
Not like the horse faces
I'm used to.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.261
(grunting)

42:04.356 --> 42:06.221
You'll soon be meeting
more of me.

42:06.316 --> 42:08.398
Remind me to shave.

42:10.737 --> 42:11.601
No!

42:11.697 --> 42:12.482
(squish)

42:12.572 --> 42:14.278
One small step for man.

42:18.412 --> 42:20.277
( catching his breath )

42:22.999 --> 42:26.742
Donde esta la cucaracha?

42:33.343 --> 42:35.800
D'Argo:
John, what the frell are we
gonna do with Scorpius?

42:35.887 --> 42:36.967
Man, I just don't know.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.716
He could have gone to ground,
but he didn't.

42:38.807 --> 42:40.343
He put his ass on the
line for us, I guess.

42:40.434 --> 42:41.765
I don't know. I just...
-John...

42:41.852 --> 42:43.262
I just, don't know.

42:43.353 --> 42:44.513
D, look.

42:44.604 --> 42:46.219
Bottom line.

42:48.275 --> 42:50.687
I don't think we have a cage
that's gonna hold the
son of a bitch.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.154
I agree with you on all counts.
-Yeah.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.194
We should still keep a close
eye on him at all times.

42:55.282 --> 42:56.647
24/7.

42:56.742 --> 42:58.357
Rygel:
Crichton?

42:58.452 --> 43:00.158
Yeah, Ryg.

43:00.245 --> 43:04.989
There's a wrinkled old woman
floating outside the
Forward Portal.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.790
Whoa, gigantic oops.
Can you do me a favor?

43:07.878 --> 43:10.711
Pop outside the Tier Three
treblin side hatch and
haul Granny in?

43:10.797 --> 43:12.298
Noranti is outside?

43:12.382 --> 43:13.883
Yeah. Don't... don't ask.

43:13.967 --> 43:16.128
She... she's got some red
Play-Doh in her pocket.

43:16.219 --> 43:18.335
A dose of that, and when she
gets in she should be all right.

43:18.430 --> 43:19.840
It's taken care of.

43:22.976 --> 43:24.261
Pilot:
Officer Sun.

43:24.352 --> 43:25.558
Yes, Pilot.

43:25.645 --> 43:27.931
Commander Crichton and I
would like your advice

43:28.023 --> 43:30.184
before we broach a topic
with Captain D'Argo.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.856
Go ahead.

43:31.943 --> 43:35.276
In view of the continuing danger
we face in Peacekeeper space,

43:35.363 --> 43:38.070
and even in the Uncharted
Territories,

43:38.158 --> 43:41.571
and given that the Scarrans will
also be looking for us now,

43:41.661 --> 43:48.783
I'm reluctantly forced to
considertraveling into
Tormented Space.

43:48.877 --> 43:50.742
Crichton:
Aeryn, you know what that is?

43:57.344 --> 43:58.880
Aeryn?

44:04.768 --> 44:06.383
Um...

44:06.478 --> 44:09.845
it's a place where neither
Peacekeepers nor Scarrans
will travel.

44:09.940 --> 44:11.271
Right.

44:11.358 --> 44:12.438
It's a rough neighborhood.

44:12.526 --> 44:14.107
Bit hard to know.

44:14.194 --> 44:18.028
Few credible reports have made
it back from there, since...

44:18.114 --> 44:20.150
those who go there
usually vanish.

44:20.242 --> 44:23.234
Navigation there is
extremely hazardous.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.693
Many ships have been lost.

44:24.788 --> 44:28.656
The area is reputed to be
a nexus of wormholes.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.490
So I've been told.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.746
And Moya's cool with that?

44:32.838 --> 44:36.205
She's understandably
reticent to go there.

44:36.299 --> 44:40.042
But she sees no other choice.

44:40.136 --> 44:41.216
Nor do I, Pilot.

44:41.304 --> 44:42.885
Crichton:
Well look on the bright side.

44:42.973 --> 44:46.010
Can't be as bad as some of the
places we've been lately.

44:46.101 --> 44:47.932
Aeryn:
Trust me.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.552
It can.
